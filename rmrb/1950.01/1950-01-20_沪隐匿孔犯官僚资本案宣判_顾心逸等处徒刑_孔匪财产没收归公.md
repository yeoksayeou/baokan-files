Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th—The Shanghai People's Court announced the verdict on the major case of hiding bureaucratic capital belonging to the war criminal Kong Xiangxi's faction on the 13th. The defendant, Gu Xinyi, general manager of Dunyu Qianzhuang (錢莊, a type of traditional Chinese private bank), and manager Gu Chengzhai were each sentenced to three years in prison. In addition, Gu Xinyi was fined 600 million RMB, and Gu Chengzhai was fined 400 million RMB. Kong's properties, including 74.02% of Dunyu Qianzhuang's capital, all of Daye Real Estate Company, and other stocks, were confiscated and nationalized. The two defendants, Gu Xinyi and Gu Chengzhai, are brothers and were entrusted by the war criminal Kong Xiangxi and his son Kong Lingkan to operate the aforementioned Qianzhuang and company in Shanghai. Before liberation, they specialized in speculation and manipulation, exploiting the people's blood and sweat. After liberation, they deliberately concealed the property, attempting to seize the bandit's property for themselves. The Shanghai Financial Management Office and the Real Estate Management Office investigated and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai People's Court. During the trial, the defendants initially made all kinds of excuses, but with human and material evidence present, they finally confessed their guilt.

    【新华社上海十九日电】上海重大的隐匿战犯孔祥熙系官僚资本案已于十三日由市人民法院宣判，被告敦裕钱庄总经理顾心逸及经理顾诚斋除各处徒刑三年外，顾心逸科罚金人民币六亿元，顾诚斋科罚金四亿元，孔匪财产包括敦裕钱庄资本百分之七十四·零二、大业地产公司全部和其他股票等没收归公。顾心逸与顾诚斋二犯为兄弟，曾受战犯孔祥熙及其子孔令侃委托，在沪经营上述钱庄及公司，解放前专事投机操纵，剥削人民血汗；解放后存心隐匿，企图将匪产占为己有。前经上海金融管理处和房地产管理处查悉，向上海市人民法院起诉。审讯期间，被告等初尚百般狡赖，但以人证物证俱在，终于俯首服罪。
