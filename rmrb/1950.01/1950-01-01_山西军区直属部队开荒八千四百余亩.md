Since the launch of the production campaign, all units have achieved significant results. Units directly under the Shanxi Military Region have reclaimed more than 8,400 mu of land in their spare time. A certain military branch has cultivated 357 mu of vegetables and more than 160 mu of crops. In the Pingyuan Military Region, a certain unit alone planted 443 mu of wheat and 43 mu of vegetables. In addition to engaging in agricultural production themselves, all units have vigorously assisted the masses in autumn harvesting and planting. A certain army mobilized more than 20,000 personnel and more than 800 livestock to help the masses harvest more than 13,000 mu and plant 360 mu of wheat. The aid-the-people harvesting teams of the Suiyuan Military Region and the Hebei Military Region brought their own rations and went dozens of miles outside the city to help the masses with autumn harvesting. The people in the new areas generally reflected: "We have never seen such a good army before. The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are truly considering the masses in everything!"

In addition, units of the North China Military Region, almost every army, division, military region, and military sub-region, widely carried out grass cutting and firewood gathering campaigns, solving the difficulties of bedding grass and coal for this winter. According to incomplete statistics from eleven units including a certain detachment of the Chabei Military Sub-region, a certain regiment of the Suiyuan Military Region, and a certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region, a total of more than 1,445,000 jin of firewood and grass were cut. Ma Jiuzi, a soldier from a certain regiment of the Suiyuan Military Region, traveled thirty miles round trip to carry 173 jin of firewood and was hailed as a labor hero. The commander and director of the political department of the Shijiazhuang sub-region personally led troops to cut grass.

　　　　　　Self-Reliance in Building Barracks

In addition to agricultural production, many units have organized labor to engage in construction work. The Shanxi Military Region and the garrison troops stationed in a certain city alone built 452 barracks, 2 bathhouses, and 6 toilets. A certain battalion of the Chahar Military Region made 100,000 adobe bricks and fired 40,000 bricks, solving the material difficulties in construction. The replenishment training division of a certain corps formed an engineering team composed of soldiers who knew carpentry, ironwork, and masonry to manufacture office desks, basketball racks, dustpans, iron shovels and other daily necessities. A certain army even opened charcoal kilns and lime kilns for production. Animal husbandry is also very common in the army, with a certain unit raising 1,162 pigs alone. Many units also participated in national construction voluntary labor, demonstrating the high enthusiasm of the People's Liberation Army in cherishing the new motherland. A certain division's special forces participated in the construction of the capital's city walls, the first general team of the Military and Political University renovated the railway subgrade in Changxindian, a certain regiment repaired 36 li of the Jinxi Highway, and a certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region participated in the construction work in Zhangjiakou.

As a result of the active participation of various units in production and construction work, in addition to saving national expenditures, many units have moved into warm and comfortable barracks. In terms of living standards, according to a survey by a certain corps, all units have ensured that they eat 5 to 7 qian of oil, salt, and meat every day, and some units can even eat 1 liang of meat and 1.6 jin of vegetables, with some surplus. In August, a certain division withdrew funds from production surplus to buy 1,000 fountain pens for the soldiers. In the process of production, some individual units also had biases, such as competing with the people for profits and using food as a production fund, all of which have been promptly corrected.

    山西军区直属部队开荒八千四百余亩
    自开展生产运动以来，各部队均获得显著成绩。山西军区直属各单位工作之余开荒八千四百多亩。某军种菜三百五十七亩，种庄稼一百六十多亩。平原军区仅某部即种麦四百四十三亩，种菜四十三亩。各部队除自己进行农业生产以外，并大力帮助群众秋收秋种。某军全军共动员二万余人工，八百余牲口，帮助群众收割一万三千余亩，种麦三百六十亩。绥远军区、河北军区的助民收割队，自带干粮出城数十里帮助群众收秋。新区人民普遍反映：“自古以来没见过这样好的队伍，共产党、解放军真是处处为群众打算呵！”
    此外，华北军区部队几乎每个军、师、军区、军分区，都广泛地进行了割草打柴运动。解决了今冬铺草和烧煤困难。根据察北军分区某支队、绥远军区某团、察哈尔军区某团等十一个单位不完全统计，共割柴草一百四十四万五千余斤。绥远军区某团战士马九子，往返三十里，背柴一百七十三斤，被誉为劳动英雄。石家庄分区司令员、政治部主任亲自带领部队割草。
            自己动手  建设营房
    除了农业生产之外，许多部队都组织了劳动力，从事建设工作，仅山西军区及驻某市警备部队，就修建了营房四百五十二间，澡塘二所，厕所六个。察哈尔军区一个营打砖坯十万块，烧砖四万块，解决了建设中的材料困难。某兵团补训师把会做木工、铁工、泥工的战士组成工程队，制造办公桌、篮球架、簸箕、铁铲等日常用具。某军更开设了木炭窑、石灰窑进行生产。牧养家畜在部队里也很普遍，仅某部就养猪一千一百六十二口。许多部队更参加了国家建设的义务劳动，表现了人民解放军爱护新生祖国的高度热情。某师特种部队参加修筑人民首都的城墙，军大一总队翻修长辛店的铁路路基，某团修理津西公路三十六里，察哈尔军区某团参加了张市的建设工作。
    由于各部队积极参加了生产建设工作，除节省了国家开支外，许多部队已住上了温暖舒适的营房；在生活上，据某兵团调查，各部队均保证了每天吃油、盐、肉各五钱至七钱，有的部队甚至能吃到肉一两，菜一斤六两，尚有节余。某师八月份从生产盈余中抽款给战士们买了一千支自来水笔。在生产过程中，也曾有个别单位产生过偏向，如与民争利及以食粮作生产基金等现象，均已得到及时纠正。
