[Tianjin News] Since its establishment last autumn, the North China Cooperative Depot has been actively promoting material exchange among various regions and establishing extensive credit relations with local cooperatives, adhering to the principle of serving cooperatives in various regions. In coordination with Tianjin market management, it has achieved significant results in the past three months. From September to the end of December last year, the depot organized the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas totaling 26.4 billion yuan, of which 54 percent flowed into rural areas, with yarn, kerosene, and matches being the most significant; 16 percent of agricultural products flowed into cities, mainly consisting of mountain goods and local products; and 30 percent was inter-city allocation. Self-operated business accounted for 56 percent, and agency business accounted for 44 percent. It contracted to sell 161,000 catties of wool yarn for lower-level cooperatives and sold 11,182,000 catties of sodium sulfate to disaster areas, promptly supplying raw materials to factories and supporting production in disaster areas. It transported 12.58 million catties of industrial products to rural areas for lower-level cooperatives, saving approximately 148.5 million yuan in transshipment handling fees, thus reducing costs. It established direct ordering relationships with 111 public and private enterprises, all of which offered preferential discounts based on ex-factory prices and sent 205 kinds of samples, displayed in the sample room for lower-level cooperatives to choose from. Among them were 42 kinds of agricultural products for factories to order, thus establishing a direct relationship between industrial and agricultural products and reducing intermediate exploitation.

In order to organize the dispersed funds of various agencies stationed in Tianjin to achieve mutual support, the depot launched a credit business. From September 20th last year to the end of the year, a total of 83 agencies established credit relations, with total deposits and loans amounting to over 11.7 billion yuan.

In terms of coordinating market management, the depot has always paid attention to implementing the tasks assigned by various agencies, handling them in a unified manner in a step-by-step and planned way (except for sporadic cases). Especially during price fluctuations, it actively cooperated to stabilize the market. For example, during the price fluctuations in November last year, the depot sold more than 1,600 bolts of cloth in a single day at most.

In terms of business methods, the depot adopted the method of prioritizing public over private, directly ordering from factories, and generally not engaging in buying and selling in the market. In the past few months, transactions through the market were limited to some sporadic items, accounting for only 4 percent of the total transaction volume, greatly reducing the scope of activities for speculative capital.

In total, from September to December, 173 cooperative units in various regions had business dealings with the depot, including: Northeast, East China, Central China, Hebei, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai. In order to exchange experiences from various regions and implement policies, resident forums are frequently held; a total of 15 such meetings were held in three months. In order to improve the depot's business, each guest room is equipped with an opinion book to solicit opinions widely. For guest learning, there are dedicated personnel responsible for organizing and leading, and there is a reading room and a price quotation announcement area for guests to read. In terms of guest welfare, there are preferential measures for services such as haircuts, bathing, and watching movies and dramas, and a consumer cooperative for staff and guests has also been organized.

In order to make greater improvements in business in the future, the depot has also determined that this year it will strengthen the planning of work, strive for initiative, and require cooperatives in various regions to send their one-year or half-year purchase and sales plans to the depot so as to find sales channels for agricultural products in advance and avoid temporary and chaotic work. Furthermore, since cooperative depots in various provinces and cities have been established one after another, it is hoped that there will be close connections between depots and between depots and the state-owned economy. It is also hoped that each depot can further establish leadership relationships, establish meeting and reporting systems, and strengthen business. Furthermore, it is necessary to vigorously open up sales channels for local products in the future, strive to appropriately increase the proportion of agricultural products flowing into cities, and organize the export of peach kernels, medicinal materials, straw braid, and so on.

    天津合作货栈促进物资交流  广泛建立信用关系
    【天津讯】华北合作货栈自去年秋季成立以来，即本为各地合作社服务方针，积极促进各地物资交流广泛与各地合作社建立信用关系，并配合天津市场管理，三个月来已获得显著成绩。该社自去年九月到十二月底，组织城乡物资交换共二六四亿多元；其中流入农村的占百分之五十四，以纱布、煤油、火柴为大宗；流入城市的农产品占百分之十六，主要为山货、土产；城市间调剂占百分之三十。其中自营业务占百分之五十六，代营业务占百分之四十四。代下级社订合同卖出羊毛线一六一、○○○斤，给灾区卖出皮硝一一、一八二、○○○斤，及时供给了工厂原料，也扶植了灾区生产。代下级社运输一、二五八万斤工业品到农村，节省转运手续费约一亿四千八百五十万元，降低了成本。与公私企业一一一家建立了直接订货关系，均按出厂价折扣优待，并送来样二○五种，陈列在样品室，供下级社选购。其中有农产品四二种供工厂订货，就这样使工农产品发生直接关系，减去中间剥削。
    该栈又为了组织驻津各社的分散资金达到相互支持，举办了信用业务，自去年九月二十日开始到年底止，共有八十三社建立了信用关系，存贷总额为一一七亿多元。
    在配合市场管理方面，该栈始终注意贯彻各社所交任务，有步骤、有计划地统一办理（零星者例外）。尤其在物价波动时，更积极配合稳定市场。如去年十一月间物价波动时，该栈最多一天就售出过一千六百多匹布。
    在经营方式上，采取先公后私办法，直接与工厂订货，一般的不在市场上购销，几个月来通过市场的，仅限于一些零星物品，不过占总交易额百分之四，大大缩小了投机资本活动的范围。
    总计自九月到十二月与该栈发生业务往来的各地合作社共计一七三单位，在地区上包括：东北、华东、华中、河北、绥远、山西、平原、察哈尔及京沪二市。为了交流各地经验及贯彻政策，经常召开住客座谈会；三个月共召开此种会议十五次。为了改进货栈业务，各客室并设有意见簿，广泛征求意见。在客人学习上，有专人负责，组织领导，设有阅报处，行情公布处，供客人阅览。在客人福利方面，如理发、洗澡、看影剧均有优待办法，还组织了职员及客人的消费合作社。
    为了今后在业务上有更大的改进，该社并确定今年要加强工作的计划性，争取主动，要求各地社将一年或半年的购销计划送给该栈，以便提前给农产品找销路，免得临时乱抓，工作混乱。又由于目前各省、市合作货栈相继建立，希今后栈与栈间和栈与国营经济间要密切联系，各栈并希能进一步树立领导关系，建立会议、汇报制度加强业务。再者今后还要大力打开土产销路，务使流入城市的农产品比例再适当提高，并组织桃仁、药材、草帽辫等出口。
