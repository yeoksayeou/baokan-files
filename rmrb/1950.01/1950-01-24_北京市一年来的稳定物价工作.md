    Beijing's Work on Stabilizing Prices Over the Past Year
    Wang Jing
    In 1949, the general price trend in Beijing was as follows: prices remained stable from February to April, fluctuated slightly in late April, stabilized again in late May, fluctuated again from late July to August, remained stable in August, September, and October, rose again in November, and fell back in December. According to statistics on 38 major commodities in Beijing, the general price increase index for 1949 (using February as the base period) is as follows:
    Month		General Index
    February		100
    March		117.60
    April		148.40
    May		270.70
    June		292.70
    July		515.80
    August		977.70
    September		988.20
    October		1163.00
    November		2937.00
    December		3937.00
    Among various commodities, grain and fuel had the highest increase indices. By the end of December, both categories had risen more than sixty-fold. Non-staple foods increased fifty-three-fold, and cotton cloth increased forty-three-fold. Last year, due to the victorious development of the military situation, a large number of military and government personnel formerly belonging to the Kuomintang government were taken over. The restoration of damaged production and transportation began, and the state's financial revenue could not cover its expenditure. It was inevitable to issue currency to make up for the financial deficit. Therefore, the depreciation of currency and the rise in prices were unavoidable. The price increases in Beijing occurred within this overall national price situation. However, the three largest price fluctuations in Beijing during the year in April, July, and November were caused not only by the above-mentioned general reasons, but also by the lack of experience of financial and economic personnel, insufficient understanding of the situation, inflexible material allocation and transportation, and speculation by unscrupulous merchants.
    Over the past year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has achieved certain results in controlling prices and combating speculation, and has gained many experiences and lessons. After the liberation of Beijing, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China promptly exchanged and eliminated the fake gold yuan notes, cracked down on the black market for gold and silver, and defeated the malignant inflation that had been created by the Kuomintang reactionary government's exploitation of the people for many years. This initially stabilized prices, established the prestige of the Renminbi, and stabilized the financial market. State-owned trading companies controlled a sufficient amount of materials, opened up the long-interrupted urban-rural trade, and guaranteed the lives of workers and supplied the broad masses of working people with necessities through markets, cooperatives, and retail stores. Over the past year, state-owned trading companies supplied more than 236.4 million jin of grain, more than 295,000 tons of coal, and more than 486,200 bolts of cloth, averaging more than 60% of the daily market turnover. The selling prices were generally 10% to 20% lower than the market prices, which played a huge role in ensuring the lives of the working people.
    Looking at the price fluctuations in Beijing in April, July, and November, although they had the commonality of the national price trend, they also had other local factors. For example, in April, North China experienced a spring drought with little rain, and there was a period of scarcity before the new harvest. Grain prices in nearby cities increased successively, but the grain price adjustment in Beijing was not timely, so grain flowed out of Beijing, and the source of grain stagnated. Therefore, in late April, Beijing's prices began to fluctuate, led by coarse grains. The price fluctuation in July was more intense than in April. Initially, it was mainly affected by Shanghai. After the liberation of Shanghai, the Renminbi had not yet reached the countryside, temporarily manifesting a phenomenon of currency concentration in big cities. In addition, due to the blockade by the Kuomintang bandits and floods in various places, Shanghai's prices soared. After the opening of traffic between Beijing and Shanghai on July 10, a large amount of speculative capital concentrated in Shanghai and Nanjing flowed north. Coal, iron, alkali, soybeans, vegetable oil, and other goods were shipped from Beijing and Tianjin to Shanghai, and Tianjin's cotton cloth was shipped in large quantities to the Northeast. Thus, industrial products led the price increases. The price of cloth per bolt in July increased by 84% compared with June. In early July, one ton of coal could be exchanged for 65.83 jin of flour, but by early August, it could be exchanged for 109.24 jin. From the perspective of the exchange rate between industrial and agricultural products, the prices of industrial products were the highest for the whole year during this period. By late July, continuous rainfall led to a sharp decrease in grain arrivals, and grain prices tended to rise again, until early August when prices stabilized. In addition to the above reasons, the speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, taking advantage of the lax monetary policy, also played an important role in these two price increases. The government did not do enough in market management, planned regulation of market materials, and organizing and guiding speculative capital to invest in production.
    The price increase in November was the largest and longest-lasting in the country. The initial stage of the price fluctuation was in early October. Due to the shortage of grain in the cotton-producing areas and disaster areas of North China, grain prices led the increase; after the liberation of Suiyuan, the demand for cotton cloth increased, which also led to an increase in cotton cloth prices. Therefore, Beijing's prices caused a new fluctuation from October 7. On October 28, after the closure of the Beijing-Suiyuan railway due to the prevention of plague, merchants took the opportunity to hoard and deliberately create an atmosphere of "grain shortage," causing public psychological panic and rushing to buy coal and grain, forming the peak of price increases on November 11 and 12. Millet cost 440 yuan per jin on the 10th, but jumped to 800 yuan on the 12th. First-grade coal cost 81,000 yuan per ton on the 10th, but soared to 165,000 yuan on the 13th.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government has consistently adopted a policy of coordinating material strength and administrative power to eliminate speculation and stabilize prices. Prices in April and July fell back under such measures. This policy is correct, but when state-owned trading agencies did not fully understand the trend of currency issuance and the general increase in national prices, most of the materials sold at low prices in the market were purchased and hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for profiteering. For example, in November, merchants purchased flour from grain companies at 21,500 yuan per bag and sold it at retail outlets for 45,000 yuan. They purchased lump coal from coal and iron companies at 70,000 yuan per ton and sold it for 150,000 yuan, making more than double the profit. In this way, state materials were lost, and the masses did not benefit. Therefore, when prices fluctuated in November, the Beijing Municipal People's Government adopted the method of strengthening retail sales, setting up grain, coal, and cloth retail stores to directly supply citizens. By late November, 149 grain retail stores had been established, capable of supplying 600,000 people. Together with the 400,000 cadres and workers supplied by cooperatives, direct supply accounted for 71.36% of the 1.4 million urban residents in the city. In terms of coal and cloth supply, 150 coal briquette processing and retail stores and six cloth consignment stores were also established. This direct supply to citizens eliminated intermediate exploitation by merchants, guaranteed the lives of the working people, and played a considerable role in stabilizing prices. At the same time, the government severely cracked down on speculative activities in grain, coal, and cloth, and arrested 16 major unscrupulous merchants who hoarded goods, including grain tiger Wang Zhenting. In addition, the government actively cleared grain sources, organized private merchants to purchase grain outside, and the bank tightened currency, stopped lending, and strengthened financial and market management. Under these various effective measures, prices fell across the board by November 25.
    The experiences of stabilizing prices over the past year are: 1. Strengthen retail sales and directly supply citizens; 2. Maintain a reasonable price difference with other regions, not too low; 3. Actively and timely adjust prices and regulate materials.
    The experiences and lessons learned in stabilizing prices over the past year are, first of all, to strengthen retail sales and directly supply citizens. If only the method of selling materials to the market and suppressing prices at low prices is adopted, it will only create opportunities for private merchants to speculate. As a result, the public consumes materials, the masses do not benefit, and prices still cannot be stabilized. Therefore, only by strengthening retail sales, so that the supply of citizens can be solved, can we gain maneuverability in the market struggle, and use the country's strong material strength to prevent prices from exceeding the track of steady rise. As for retail prices, a certain ratio should be maintained with market prices, not too low, as too low a price will hinder normal material exchanges, but it should not blindly fluctuate with market prices.
    Secondly, in price guidance, a reasonable difference must be maintained with relevant material exchange areas and between commodities. Prices should be proactively lowered or raised, not too low, as too low a price will hinder normal material exchanges between the city and other places, resulting in internal currency injection and outflow of materials, which will hide the factors of price surges. For example, in early November, Beijing's prices were too low. Grain sources in eastern Beijing, such as Tongxian County's corn and soybeans, all went to Tianjin instead of Beijing. Tianjin merchants transported flour to Beijing and tried to transport it back to Tianjin.
    Thirdly, state-owned trading agencies should be proactive and flexible in the market struggle. They must grasp the correct prices, strive for initiative, and make timely and reasonable adjustments and appropriate regulation of materials based on the overall national price situation, local market situation, and their own strength, so as to avoid blindness and passivity, eliminate the factors of price fluctuations, and prevent speculative merchants from taking advantage of the situation. The agencies in charge of controlling prices must also clearly set out price policies and goals based on the above points, and should not only sell without buying, only low without high. On the price statistics chart, strive to make the price increase trend a nearly straight curve, and the angles of the curve should not differ much, so that prices can be controlled maneuverably and the market can be controlled.

    北京市一年来的稳定物价工作
    王敬
    一九四九年一年来北京市的物价，总的变动情况是：二月至四月是平稳状态，四月下旬稍有波动，到五月下旬转稳，七月底到八月间又呈波动，八、九、十月份平稳，十一月又上涨，十二月回跌。根据北京市三十八种主要物资的统计，一九四九年一年来价格上涨的总指数如下（以二月份为基期）：
    月份            总指数
    二月            一○○
    三月            一一七·六○
    四月            一四八·四○
    五月            二七○·七○
    六月            二九二·七○
    七月            五一五·八○
    八月            九七七·七○
    九月            九八八·二○
    十月            一一六三·○○
    十一月          二九三七·○○
    十二月          三九三七·○○
    各种物价中以粮食类和燃料类上涨指数最多，至十二月份止，两类上涨的指数都是六十倍强，副食类上升五十三倍，纱布上升四十三倍。去年一年由于军事形势的胜利发展，接收了原属国民党政府的大量军政人员，开始恢复被破坏的生产和交通，国家财政入不敷出，势必发行货币以弥补财政赤字，因此币值下跌和物价上涨是不可避免的。而本市的物价上涨，就是在全国物价的这个总形势下产生的。但本市一年来发生的四月、七月和十一月三次最大的物价波动，除上述总的原因外，还有财经部门工作人员经验较少、对情况掌握不足、物资调运不灵活和奸商的投机倒把等原因。
    一年来，北京市人民政府在掌握物价和反投机斗争中，收到了一定成绩，并得到许多经验教训。北京解放后，中国人民银行北京分行便抓紧兑换、肃清伪金元券，取缔金银黑市，打垮了数年来由于国民党反动政府压榨人民而制造的恶性通货膨胀，使物价得到初步稳定，并奠定了人民币的威信，稳定了金融市场。国营贸易公司更掌握相当充分的物资，打开了久已断绝的城乡贸易，并通过市场、合作社、零售店，保证了职工生活，供应广大劳动人民以生活必需品，一年来由国营贸易公司供应了粮食二亿三千六百四十余万斤，煤二十九万五千余吨，布四十八万六千二百余匹，平均占每天市场成交量的百分之六十以上，出售的价格，一般较市价低百分之十至二十，这在保证劳动人民生活上，是起了巨大作用的。
    就北京市四月、七月和十一月的物价波动来看，虽然它有全国物价总趋势的共同性，但也有其它地方因素。例如四月华北地区春旱少雨，青黄不接，附近城市的粮价相继提高，而京市粮价调整不及时，所以形成京市粮食倒流，粮源停滞，于是四月下旬，京市物价便由粗粮带头，开始波动。七月份物价波动，较四月份激烈，初起主要是受上海影响，因上海解放后，人民币尚未下乡，暂时表现了通货集中于大城市的现象，加以国民党匪帮的封锁，以及各地水灾等原因，上海物价猛涨，至七月十日京沪通车后，集中在沪宁的游资，大量北流；而京、津两地煤、铁、碱面、大豆、植物油等南运上海，天津纱布又大量北运东北，于是工业品带头上涨，市布每匹七月份较六月份上涨百分之八十四，七月上旬门煤每吨可换面粉六五点八三斤，到八月上旬竟换到一○九点二四斤。这一时期，从工农业产品交换比率来看，工业品价格为全年最高的时期。到七月下旬阴雨连绵，来粮锐减，粮价又趋上升，直到八月初旬物价才转趋平稳。这两次物价上涨，除了上述原因外，奸商利用松弛的银根，投机倒把，推波助澜，也是重要的因素，政府对于市场管理和有计划的调剂市场物资及组织和引导游资投向生产事业等，都作得不够。
    十一月份的物价上涨，是全国幅度最大、时间持续最久的一次。物价波动的初期，是在十月上旬，由于华北产棉区和灾区缺粮，使粮价带头上涨；绥远解放后，棉布的需要量增加，这样又引起纱布上涨。因此，京市物价自十月七日起，又引起新的波动。到十月二十八日，因防鼠疫京绥线交通封锁后，商人更乘机囤积居奇，故意造成“粮荒”空气，引起群众心理恐慌，争购煤粮，而形成十一月十一、十二两日物价上涨的高峰，伏地小米十日每斤四百四十元，十二日竟跳到八百元，门煤甲块十日每吨价八万一千元，十三日竟涨到十六万五千元。
    京市人民政府的措施，是一贯采取物资力量和行政力量互相配合，取缔投机、稳定物价的方针。四、七两月物价就是在这样措施下回跌的。这个方针是正确的，但是，当国营贸易机关对货币发行、全国物价普升的趋势认识不足时，在市场低价抛售的物资，大部都被奸商套购囤积，暴利出售。如十一月份商人以二万一千五百元一袋套购的粮食公司面粉，在门市竟售四万五千元，以七万元一吨套购的煤铁公司块煤，售价竟达十五万元，赚利达一倍以上。这样国家物资损失了，而群众并没有得到实惠。于是京市人民政府在十一月物价波动时，便采取了加强零售的办法，普设粮、煤、布零售店，直接供应市民。到十一月下旬，只粮食零售店即设立了一百四十九处，可供应六十万人口，加上合作社供给的四十万干部和职工，直接供应者已占全市城区人口一百四十万的百分之七一点三六。在煤布供应方面，也建立了煤球加工零售店一百五十处，纱布代售店六处。这样直接供应市民，免去商人中间剥削，保证了劳动人民的生活，在稳定物价上起了相当作用。同时严厉取缔粮、煤、纱布的投机活动，逮捕了粮老虎王振庭等十六家囤积居奇的重要奸商。此外，积极疏通粮源，组织私商外出购粮；银行也紧缩通货，停止放款，加强金融管制及市场管理。在这种种有效措施下，到十一月二十五日物价即全面回落。
    一年来稳定物价工作的经验是：一、加强零售，直接供应市民；二、与其他地区物价保持合理差额，不宜太低；三、主动地及时地调整物价，吞吐物资。
    一年来在稳定物价上所获得的经验教训，首先是加强零售，直接供应市民。如果只是采取向市场抛售物资，低价平抑，就正给私商造成投机的机会，结果，公家消耗了物资，群众没得到利益，而物价依然不得稳定。因此，只有加强零售，使市民的供应得到解决，然后才能在市场斗争上取得机动，运用国家雄厚的物资力量使物价不致越出稳步上升的轨道。关于零售价格，则应与市场价格保持一定的比例，不宜太低，太低则会妨碍正常物资交流，但也不应随市场价格盲目的变动。
    其次，在物价指导上，必须与有关物资交流地区间和商品间保持合理的差额，应主动的降低或提高，不宜太低，太低就会阻碍本市与外地的正常物资交流，结果造成货币内注，物资外流，潜伏了物价暴涨的因素。如十一月初，北京物价太低，京东的粮源地区如通县的玉米、黄豆等都走天津不运北京，天津客商运京面粉，又设法运回天津。
    第三，国营贸易机关在市场斗争上，应主动灵活，必须依据全国物价的总形势和当地市场形势，自己的力量，来掌握正确的价格，争取主动，作及时合理的调整，适当的吞吐物资，免除盲目和被动，消灭物价波动的因素，使投机商人无隙可乘。掌握物价的机关，也要依据上述各点，明确地定出物价方针和目标，不应该只卖不买，只低不高，在物价统计图上，力求使物价上升的趋势，成为一个近似直线的曲线，而曲线的一些角度，相差不大，这样就可以机动的掌握物价，控制市场。
