The Top Student
—A Story of Lenin's Childhood

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin's original name) entered secondary school at the age of nine and was an outstanding student in his class.

Every day after school, he would immediately tell his father what had happened in school that day: what questions he had answered from the teacher, and how many points he had received... because his scores were always very high, when he passed his father's study and returned to his own room, he would usually recite while walking: "German one hundred points, Greek one hundred points..." Next time it would be "Algebra one hundred points, Latin one hundred points..."

Even when Lenin was very young, he understood the importance of diligent work habits. Once, he attentively listened to his sister Olya patiently practicing the piano, and he said, "Look! Such diligent work is truly amazing!" From then on, he consciously began to cultivate this habit of patient work.

He consistently ranked first in his class for eight years until he graduated from secondary school.

His good grades were not solely due to his high talent. From a young age, he had a great desire for knowledge. In school, he listened attentively to the teachers' lectures. He liked foreign languages the most, and when learning foreign languages, he often studied the lessons that the teachers had not yet taught.

Because he paid attention to the teachers' explanations in school, he spent less time preparing lessons at home than other students, so he had time to rest and read other books.

Anyone who knew young Lenin could remember that the most prominent feature of his life was: no matter what he did, he always completed it from beginning to end, very accurately. He could not tolerate a careless attitude towards textbooks and notebooks, and he did not like his desk to be messy. His books were always neatly arranged, and his pencils were sharpened to a point.

From the fact that he always demanded orderliness and precision in any work, it can be seen that he had a very disciplined approach to doing things since he was a child.

For example: how did he write compositions in school? The vast majority of his classmates often threw the composition topics left by the teacher aside, procrastinating day after day. When it came time to hand in the composition, they often had to burn the midnight oil, and the grades were still not good. Lenin was different. He wrote articles according to a certain outline. As soon as the teacher gave the topic, he immediately drafted an outline, and then took a few blank sheets of paper, folding them in half. He drafted on the left half of the paper, elaborating according to the prepared outline. The right side of the paper was left blank until the last few days, when he would record supplements, revisions, explanations, and the reference books he wanted to cite. In this way, day by day, the right side of the paper was filled with such annotations. When it was almost time to hand in the composition, he took a few more blank sheets of paper and wrote a draft in pencil. In the process of writing, he consulted the books he had cited and marked in his first draft. These books he had already prepared, arranged in order, and placed bookmarks in the pages he needed to refer to. Then, all that remained was to take out his notebook and copy it neatly with a pen, without any further corrections. He borrowed the books needed for the composition from the municipal library.

The secondary school principal once said to Lenin's mother, Maria Alexandrovna: "In your son's compositions, one can always see that he has thought systematically, and in the concise, clear, and accessible narrative, one can see the richness of his thoughts."

Lenin graduated from secondary school at the age of seventeen, and because of his excellent grades, he received a gold medal.

Although his studies were good, he never showed that he was superior to others to his classmates. He did his best to help his classmates; he often arrived at school before class. On the blackboard, he explained the most incomprehensible points to classmates who could not do their homework. Sometimes he also organized groups of five or six people, and Lenin and they would jointly study the subjects they considered difficult, and he also helped individual classmates, and was always very enthusiastic.

In 1887, Lenin entered Kazan University. When he entered the university, he already possessed a strong character and the habit of observing labor discipline. He actively participated in the first gathering of university students protesting military and police oppression. He and other (agitators) were arrested and imprisoned. The escorting policeman asked him:

"Why are you rebelling? Young man, you must know that there is a wall in front of you!"

Lenin said: "The wall is a rotten wall. As long as you touch it, it will collapse!"

He was expelled and banished to the countryside, but he completed all the university courses through self-study. He took the graduation exam with his classmates and did very well.

Lenin was able to achieve such great achievements, which is closely related to his efforts to study and transform himself from a young age.

    考第一的学生
    ——列宁少年时代的故事
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·乌里扬诺夫（列宁的原名）九岁入中学，他是班里的高材生。
    他每天放学回家以后，马上就告诉爸爸，今天学校里所发生的事情：他回答了先生的什么问题，以及他又得到了多少分……，因为他的分数每次都是很高的，因此当他经过他爸爸的书房回到自己屋子的时候，通常总是一边走着一边念着：“德文一百分，希腊文一百分……”下一次又是“代数一百分，拉丁文一百分……”
    列宁还很小的时候，就已经懂得努力工作的习惯很重要，有一次他注意地听他的姐姐奥利亚耐心的练习钢琴，他说：“瞧！这样的努力干，真了不得呀！”从此他就开始自觉地培养这种耐心的工作习惯。
    一直到中学毕业，八年中他总是考第一名。
    考的好并不是光因为他的天才高。他从幼年时代起，就有极大的求知欲。在学校里，他聚精会神地听教员讲课，他最喜欢外国语，学外国语的时候，他经常把教员没有讲的课就先念会了。
    由于在学校里注意听教员讲解，因此，他在家中准备功课的时间便比其他的同学用的少些，于是他就有时间休息和读其他的书了。
    凡是知道少年列宁的人，都能记得他一生最突出的特点，就是：无论他做什么事情，他总是有始有终，非常精确的把它完成，粗心对待课本和笔记本的态度，他是不能容忍的，他不喜欢自己桌上乱七八糟。他的书籍永远是整整齐齐地排列着，铅笔削得很尖。
    从他在任何工作中都极力要求有条理，精确的这件事中，可以看出他从小做事就很有规律。
    例如：他怎样在学校中作作文呢？他的同学的绝大多数，都经常把先生留下来的作文题扔在一边，一天一天拖下去。一到交作文的时候，往往就要开夜车赶，分数还是不好。列宁就不然，他是按着一定的提纲写文章的，当教员出了题目后，他马上就拟好提纲，然后再拿几张没有写过字的纸，把它对叠成两折，他在纸的左半面上起草，按着拟好的提纲发挥。而纸的右面，就空在那里，直到最后几天，他才在那上面记入补充、修改、解释，以及他想要引证的参考书，就这样逐日地，在纸的右边充满了这样的注解，到快交作文的时候，他重新又拿几张白纸用铅笔打草稿。在写作当中，他翻阅他第一次起草时所引证和标志出的那些书籍。这些书，是他早已准备好了的，按次序排列好，还在需要参考的篇页里放进了书签。而后，他就只剩下拿出本子来，用钢笔干干净净地抄一遍，而不会再涂抹了。作文所需要的书，他是从市立图书馆借来的。
    中学校长曾对列宁的母亲马利亚·亚历山大说：“在你的儿子的作文里，总能够看出他是有系统的思考过，在紧凑、明了与通俗的叙述中，可以看出他思想的丰富。”
    列宁十七岁在中学毕业，因为优秀的成绩，他得到一个金奖牌。
    他的功课好，对同学可从没有表现出自己比别人高一头来，他尽自己力量去帮助同学；他常在上课以前就到了学校。在黑板上，向做不出作业的同学们讲解他们所最不明白的地方。有时候还组织五六个人的小组，列宁和他们一起共同研究他们认为难懂的那些功课，他也帮助个别的同学，而且永远是非常热心的。
    一八八七年列宁考入加桑大学。入大学时，他已具有了坚强的性格，遵守劳动纪律的习惯。他积极地参加了大学生抗议军警压迫的第一次集会。和其他的（煽动者）一齐被捕入狱。押送的警察问他道：
    “你为什么要造反呢？年青人，要知道在你面前的是一堵墙呵！”
    列宁说：“墙是已腐朽了的墙。只要你碰一下它就会垮的呀！”
    他被开除了，被放逐到农村去，可是他自修完了大学的一切课程。和同学们一块参加毕业考试，成绩很好。
    列宁所以能有那样大的成就，与他从少年时代就努力学习，努力改造自己是有很大关系的。
