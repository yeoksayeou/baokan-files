Go to the Disaster Areas!
Tianjin County Cadres Calculate Production for Disaster Victims Household by Household
[This newspaper's Hebei report] Since Tianjin County reviewed its failure to grasp the leadership of production in the severely affected areas, the county's various departments promptly transferred twenty-eight cadres, divided into three groups, led by the main responsible cadres of the county's departments, and went to the severely affected areas (five, eight, and nine) to carry out disaster relief work with a focus. They first corrected the bureaucratic style of work that only made appeals without seeking practicality in the past, personally found disaster victims in their homes, specifically helped disaster victims calculate and solve difficulties in production, and established the disaster victims' confidence in self-reliance. Under this work style, the work of production and disaster relief has made preliminary progress and achievements. For example, in Zhu Tang Village in the ninth district, the county and district cadres first conducted research and analysis household by household through the village cadres, dividing the village's two hundred and twenty-three households into three categories. The first category of one hundred and twenty-six households had no difficulty in surviving the famine; the second category of seventy-three households had the conditions for production but lacked capital; the third category of thirteen households were all poor, widowed, orphaned, elderly, and weak, without production conditions. After this analysis, they found the target for leading production, mainly the second and third categories of households. Using the working method of holding small-scale forums, they implemented the spirit of production for self-salvation, introduced the famine survival experiences of other villages, and proposed ways for everyone to engage in production. For example, Wang Fuchang's family of four were relying on borrowing and selling things to maintain their lives. The village cadres suggested that he sell firewood, first selling the twenty bundles of firewood he had stored as capital. Li Xueen really had no way to arrange capital, so fish farmer Liu Yuxing suggested, "If you really have no capital, you can carry our fish and sell them, and then pay us back." After two such meetings, seventy households found ways to engage in production, overcoming the dependent thinking that they could not produce without loans. For the thirteen households of orphans, widows, elderly, and weak, they also came up with ways to engage in production. For Li Xiaosan and his mother, one old and one young, the solution was: Xiaosan (a teenager) would collect firewood to sell, and his mother would twist hemp rope to sell. Li Guirong, who was over fifty years old and lived alone and could not engage in other production, came up with the small business of selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, which could also maintain his life. Finally, there were two households with four people who had no way to maintain their lives and could rely on relatives for assistance. The cadres of the eighth district discovered that the militiamen of Nancang Village had stored 659 jin of grain from last year's autumn harvest, so they mobilized them to take it out and invest it in production, and helped them make a plan that combined production and work: five of the eight militiamen would persist in working, and three would go out to do business. Liu Garden Village sold a broken car for 4,775 jin of grain, which was distributed to eighty-four households and invested in production. Among them, eleven households of widowers, widows, orphans, and the solitary entered the coal yard stock with the 150 jin of grain they received, and each household could receive a profit of 1,100 yuan per day. The above facts prove that: as long as you go deep into the masses and mobilize the masses, and specifically help disaster victims find solutions, you will find ways to engage in production.

    到重灾区去！
    天津县干部挨户为灾民盘算生产
    【本报河北讯】天津县自从检讨了对重灾区的生产没抓紧领导以后，县各部门及时抽调二十八个干部，分成三个小组，由县各部门主要负责干部带领，分头到达重灾区（五、八、九），有重点的深入救灾工作。他们首先纠正了过去光号召不求实际的官僚主义作风，亲自找到灾民家里，具体的帮助灾民盘算，解决生产中的困难，树立灾民的自救信心。在这种工作作风下面，才使生产救灾工作，有了初步的进展和成绩。比如在九区朱唐庄，县区干部首先通过村干部，挨门逐户进行研究分析，把全村二百二十三户人家，分成三等。头等一百二十六户，渡荒不困难；二等人家共七十三户，有条件生产，没有资本；三等人家十三户，都是贫苦孤寡老弱，没有生产条件。这样分析后，找到了领导生产的对象，主要是二、三等户。用开小型座谈会的工作方法，贯彻了生产自救的精神，介绍别的村渡荒经验，并提出大家想生产办法。比如王福昌家四口人，指着借点卖点维持生活。村干部提出叫他贩卖柴禾，先把自己存的二十捆柴禾卖了当本钱。李学恩实在没办法安置本钱，治鱼户刘玉兴提出：“实在没本可以挑俺们的鱼，卖了再交钱。”这样经过两次会，有七十户找到了生产门路；克服了非贷款不能生产的依赖思想。对于十三户孤寡老弱，也想出了生产办法。李小三母子二人，一老一小，想出的办法是：小三（十几岁）拾柴禾卖，母亲搓麻绳卖。五十多岁的李桂荣，孤身一人不能干别的生产，想出了卖烧饼果子的小买卖，也能维持生活。最后剩下两户四口人，没办法维持生活，可以依靠亲戚家帮助。八区干部发现南仓村民兵，存着去年护秋粮六百五十九斤，就动员他们拿出来，投入生产，并帮助他们作出生产和工作结合的计划：八个民兵有五个坚持工作，三个出外作买卖。刘园村把一辆破汽车铁，卖了四千七百七十五斤粮食，分到八十四户，各自投入了生产。其中有十一户鳏、寡、孤、独，把分得的一百五十斤粮食，入了煤栈股金，每天每户能分到一千一百元的利润。以上事实证明了：只要是深入群众发动群众，具体帮助灾户想办法，是会找到生产门路的。
