How to Launch a New Record-Breaking Campaign
Ye Weimin

        How the New Record-Breaking Campaign Started in Northeast China

Zhao Guoyou, a worker at the Third Factory of the Machinery Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department, created a new production record with an advanced and proactive attitude. He used to take sixteen hours to turn a pulley; now, with a top record of two hours and thirty minutes, he has broken through the fixed quota of any previous period. This exemplary behavior of his not only broke the previous production record, greatly increasing production, but also broke the conception of some management comrades and technical engineering personnel that the old standard quota was unbreakable.

After Zhao Guoyou created a new production record, the leadership promptly grasped the situation and introduced his good production experience in the newspaper. From the beginning, the leadership recognized the importance of creating new records in production, because he used advanced working methods, not simply relying on increasing labor intensity, but mainly relying on improving operating methods and improving production tools to increase production, which made it possible to formulate new and reasonable production quotas. As soon as this call was made in the newspaper, the vast number of workers in Northeast China immediately responded, and now it has become a mass movement. In this movement, a large number of model producers have emerged and are emerging, creating many new achievements. This movement has become a high tide of increased production throughout Northeast China. The Northeast Daily said that this is a "production revolution." In factories where the new record-breaking campaign has been launched, production has greatly increased, and the face of factories and enterprises has been renewed.

What is the difference between the new record-breaking campaign and previous production competitions? The essence and purpose of both are the same: to increase production and improve the quality and quantity of production through campaigns. However, the new record-breaking campaign differs from previous production competitions in that it summarizes and improves upon them. Previous production competitions often emphasized labor intensity and did not effectively combine with technological improvements. In the past, everyone exerted a high degree of labor intensity during the movement in order to gain merit, but after the movement ended, production would decline. This method could not be sustained. The current new record-breaking campaign corrects this point. At the same time, the new record-breaking campaign is also universal. At a certain standard, as long as the quota can be exceeded, over-quota rewards can be obtained. It can be applied universally to every work department, with a variety of vivid and flexible forms, such as improving quality and quantity, opposing waste, improving enterprise management, eliminating errors and accidents, and reducing defective products, all of which can create new records.

To launch a new record-breaking campaign, improve enterprise management, and increase production, administrative leaders must first have a full and deep understanding of the importance of the new record-breaking campaign and study the specific content of the new record-breaking campaign. To ensure the smooth development of this movement, the following two points must be achieved:

    1. Administrative leaders must personally go down to lead and deploy, deeply integrate with practical problems, and carry out education on creating new records for all employees, especially to enlighten the workers' class consciousness.

    2. The forces of cadres, party members, league members, active members of trade unions, and active elements among workers in the enterprise must be organized to become the foundation for launching and promoting the new record-breaking campaign. Educate them to understand the creation of new records and play a leading role in their production posts. These two points are the main factors in promoting the new record-breaking campaign.

Secondly, it is necessary to proceed step by step. If there is a lack of experience in the steps to launch the new record-breaking campaign, do not attempt to "universally launch" it all at once. You can universally call for key leadership, first find one or two departments to experiment, create typical examples, learn from experience, and then promote it comprehensively.

        Pay attention to the following issues during the campaign

    1. When advanced model producers, such as Zhao Guoyou, created a new record in turning pulleys, breaking through the old production quota, and played a leading role, the general masses had not yet accepted this movement, and individual backward elements attacked Zhao Guoyou, trying to prevent his progress in various ways and hinder the smooth development of the movement. This is not surprising. In any movement, there are always advanced and backward elements among the masses. The backward elements will inevitably obstruct the advanced elements. However, when the broad masses truly rise up, these advanced workers will not be isolated. Administrative leaders must pay attention to this issue in a timely manner. When advanced workers are attacked by individual backward elements, they should find ways to encourage and support them, educate these individual backward elements, and guide the broad masses towards the advanced producers.

    2. When new record-breaking facts have been discovered, when the creation of new records has already begun, propaganda and introduction should be launched in a timely manner, calling on all workers to learn from advanced workers and encouraging them to progress together.

    3. When workers create new records and exceed production quotas, administrative leaders should quickly give rewards. In Northeast China, 2% of the total wages of all employees in each enterprise is used as bonuses. (Editor's note: In order to meet the needs of the movement, the Ministry of Industry stipulates that bonuses can be increased when necessary.)

    4. Problems should be discovered, studied, and resolved in the movement at any time. Do not allow the movement to become biased. After the new record-breaking campaign is launched, the existing labor organization should be further improved. At the same time, a proper quota should be set for the new records that have been created.

    如何开展创造新纪录运动
    叶维民
            东北创造新纪录运动是怎样开始的
    东北工业部机器局三厂工人赵国有以先进的积极态度，创造了新的生产纪录。在从前他车一个塔轮用十六个小时，现在他以二点三十分最高的纪录突破了以往任何时期的定额。他的这一模范行为，不但打破了从前的生产纪录，把生产大大地提高了一步，而且还打破了一些管理同志和技术工程人员认为过去的标准定额，即对旧的定额，是牢不可破的观念。
    赵国有创造了新的生产纪录，领导上及时掌握这一情况，在报上介绍了他的良好的生产经验。领导上一开始就认识到在生产上创造新纪录的重要性，因为他用先进的工作方法，不是单纯的依靠加强劳动强度，而主要的是依靠改进操作方法，改进生产工具，以提高生产，这就使制订新的合理的生产定额成为可能。这一号召在报上一经提出，全东北的广大工人立即响应，现在已变成为一种群众性的运动了。在这个运动中，已经涌现和正在涌现出大批的模范生产者，创造了许多新的成绩。这一运动在全东北已经成为一种增加生产的高潮。东北日报说这是：“生产上的革命”，凡是展开创造新纪录运动的工厂，生产量大大的提高了，工厂企业的面貌为之一新。
    创造新纪录运动和以往的生产竞赛有什么不同呢？两者的本质和目的是一样的。都是通过运动增加生产，提高生产的质量和产量。但是新纪录运动不同于以往各种生产竞赛的，是在于它把从前各种生产竞赛总结起来，并提高了一步。从前的生产竞赛常常是强调劳动强度，没有很好的同改进技术结合起来。从前大家为了立功，在运动中都发挥了很高的劳动强度，当运动告一段落之后，生产量就会低落下来，这种办法不可能是经常性的，现在的创造新纪录运动就把这一点纠正了。同时，创造新纪录运动又是普遍性的，在一定的标准上，只要能够超过定额，都可以得到超额奖励。它可以普遍到每一个工作部门，具有各种各样的生动灵活的形式，如提高质量、数量，反对浪费，改善企业管理，消灭差错事故，减少废品等，都可以创造出新的纪录来。
    要想展开创造新纪录运动，改进企业管理，提高生产量，首先要求行政负责同志要对创造新纪录运动的重要性具有充分的、深刻的认识。并对创造新纪录运动的具体内容加以研究，想要使这一运动顺利的开展，必须作到这两点：
    一、行政负责干部要亲自下去领导布置，深入的结合实际问题，展开对全体职工施行创造新纪录的教育，尤其要启发工人阶级觉悟的教育。
    二、要把企业中的干部、党员、团员、工会中的积极会员、工人中的积极分子的力量组织起来，成为展开与推动创造新纪录运动的基础。对他们加以教育，使它们也对于创造新纪录有认识，在生产岗位上起带头作用，这两点是推展创造新纪录运动的主要因素。
    其次是要有步骤的进行，如在展开创造新纪录运动的步骤上，缺乏经验时，不要一下子就企图“普遍展开”，可以普遍号召重点领导，先找一、二个部门试验，创造典型，吸取经验，推及全面。
            在运动展开过程中注意下列几个问题
    一、先进的模范生产者，如赵国有在创造了车塔轮新纪录，突破了旧的生产定额，起了带头作用时，一般的群众还没有接受这种运动，个别的落后分子便对赵国有进行打击，想出各种办法阻止他的进步，阻挠运动的顺利开展。这并不奇怪，凡是一个运动的开展，群众中总有先进的和落后的，落后的一定要阻挠先进的，但是当广大群众真正起来之后，这些先进的工作者才不会孤立。行政上负责干部一定要及时注意这一问题，当先进的工作者被个别落后分子打击之时，应当想办法鼓励他，支持他，对这种个别落后分子进行教育，并引导广大群众走向先进的生产者那一方面去。
    二、已经发现有创造新纪录的事实时，当创造新纪录已经展开时，应当及时展开宣传、介绍，号召所有的工人，向先进的工作者看齐，鼓励他们一同进步。
    三、工人创造新纪录超过生产定额时，行政上的负责同志，要很快的给予奖励，在东北是以每一个企业中全体职工工资总额百分之二作为奖金。（编者按：为适应运动的需要，工业部规定，必要时奖金还可增加。）
    四、要随时在运动中发现问题，研究和解决问题。不要使运动产生偏向。在创造新纪录运动展开后，要把现有的劳动组织加以进一步的改善。同时要把已经创出来的新纪录，制定一个适当的定额。
