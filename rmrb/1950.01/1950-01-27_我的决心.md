    My Determination
    Shooting Hero of East China, Wei Laiguo
    The great year of 1949 has been victoriously traversed, and the year of 1950, in which the People's Liberation War will achieve final victory nationwide, has arrived. On this New Year's occasion, I respectfully wish Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the leaders of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, and all comrades a victorious New Year and good health.
    Recalling that under the wise leadership and education of the Party, Chairman Mao, and leaders at all levels, and with the enthusiastic help of comrades, I have made progress; but upon careful self-examination, my contribution to the Party and the people is still too little. Especially in the year 1949, I did not participate in battles and fight alongside my comrades to annihilate the enemy, which is my greatest regret.
    In December 1948, I returned to the motherland from Poland and reported on the circumstances of my trip abroad and the International Youth Day conference in Jinan and among fraternal units, and only returned to my unit after crossing the Yangtze River. After the liberation of Shanghai, I was ordered to attend the People's Political Consultative Conference. What I felt most profoundly while attending these conferences was the greatness and brilliance of our Chairman Mao.
    When attending the International Youth Day conference, I saw everywhere the respect and love of the people of all countries for Chairman Mao. They cared for our leader, Chairman Mao, as if he were one of their own, and they cared deeply about and rejoiced in the victory of the Chinese revolution as if it were their own. The representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were warmly welcomed and respected everywhere. At this conference, I personally witnessed the great strength of the people of the world, and the people of all countries were fighting heroically for their country's freedom and to defend world peace. This great force directly or indirectly aided and encouraged us to strive for the final victory of the War of Liberation and to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China.
    When I think of how I, a person of poor peasant origin, suffered oppression and exploitation in the past, not having enough to eat or wear, and today am welcomed and respected among the people of all countries, I feel even more the greatness and brilliance of the Party and Chairman Mao. He transformed me from a poor peasant into a hero, and all this glory should be attributed to the Party and Chairman Mao.
    When attending the People's Political Consultative Conference, I saw Chairman Mao in person, and I felt unspeakable joy in my heart. At the conference, I also saw the warm love and heartfelt support of the people of the whole country for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country in arduous struggles for decades, and today he has finally established the Chinese people's own government, and a new China has emerged, which makes me feel even more the greatness and brilliance of Chairman Mao. During the conference, I listened to many reports and learned a lot about national affairs, which improved my political understanding. At the same time, it also made me feel that my contribution to the people and my unwavering revolutionary will to be loyal to the revolution and the people were still far from adequate, and I still needed to work hard and temper myself well.
    Now 1949 has passed. During this year, because I was away from my unit for a long time, I not only lacked practical combat training, but also fell far behind my comrades in the study of tactical thinking and the improvement of tactical command ability. Now I am willing to study with my comrades and catch up. In naval training, I will learn the skills of naval warfare and complete the preparations for advancing into Taiwan, in order to victoriously fulfill the glorious task given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao: "Liberate Taiwan, liberate all of China." In politics, I am also willing to study together with all comrades to further improve my political awareness and establish a firm and unwavering revolutionary will to be loyal to the Party and the people. 1950 is a difficult year in victory, and I am also determined to overcome difficulties and endure hardships like all comrades, learn from the spirit of the Soviet Red Army's arduous struggle for the motherland, respond to Chairman Mao's call for production and economy, and use our active study, heroic fighting, and hard work to eliminate the remaining enemies, liberate all of China, smash the enemy's blockade, overcome all difficulties, advance towards a regularized and modernized national defense army, build our motherland, and defend our motherland.

    我的决心
    华东射击英雄  魏来国
    伟大的一九四九年胜利的渡过了，人民解放战争将在全国范围内取得最后胜利的一九五○年来到了。在这新年之际，我敬祝毛主席、朱总司令、华东军区暨三野诸位首长和全体同志新年胜利，身体健康。
    回忆起我在党、毛主席和各级首长的英明领导教育下，在同志们的热情帮助下，我得到进步；但仔细检讨起来，我对党对人民的贡献还是太少了。特别在一九四九年一年中，我没有和同志们一起参加战斗并肩歼敌，这是我感到最大的遗憾。
    一九四八年十二月我由波兰回到祖国，在济南及兄弟部队中报告了关于出国和国际青年节代表大会的情形，渡江后才回到部队。解放上海后，又奉命出席人民政治协商会议，在出席这些会议中，使我体会最深刻的是我们毛主席的伟大和英明。
    出席国际青年节大会时，我到处看到世界各国人民对毛主席的尊敬和爱戴，他们像关怀自己一样的关怀着我们的领袖——毛主席，他们对中国革命的胜利如同自己一样的深切关怀、欢腾鼓舞，中国人民解放军的代表到处受到大家热烈的欢迎与敬爱。在这个大会上我亲眼看到全世界人民力量的强大，各国人民都在为祖国的自由和保卫世界和平而英勇的斗争着。这伟大的力量都是直接或间接的援助和鼓舞着我们争取解放战争的最后胜利，建设独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。
    当我想到我这个贫苦农民出身的人，过去受着压迫、受着剥削，吃不饱、穿不暖，今天在世界各国人民中间也受着欢迎和尊敬的时候，我更感到党，和毛主席的伟大和英明，他把我从一个贫苦农民教养成英雄，这些光荣应全归于党、归于毛主席。
    在出席人民政治协商会议时，我亲眼看到了毛主席，我心里有说不出来的高兴，在会议上我也看到了全国人民对毛主席的热烈爱戴和衷心拥护。毛主席领导全国人民艰苦斗争了几十年，今天终于成立了中国人民自己的政府，出现了新的中国，使我更加感到毛主席的伟大和英明。在会议中我听了很多报告，学习了很多国家大事，使我的政治水准提高了一步。同时也使我感到自己对人民的贡献和忠心为革命为人民坚定不移的革命意志还相差太远，还须很好的努力和锻炼。
    现在一九四九年过去了，这一年当中由于我长期离开部队，不仅缺乏实战的锻炼，而且对战术思想的学习和战术指挥能力的提高也都远远落在同志们的后面了。现在我愿与同志们在一起学习，迎头赶上，在航海练兵中，学好航海作战的本领，完成进军台湾的准备，来圆满胜利的完成党和毛主席给我们的“解放台湾、解放全中国”的光荣任务。在政治上我也愿和全体同志共同学习，更进一步提高政治觉悟，树立牢固的为党为人民坚定不移的革命意志。一九五○年是胜利中的困难年，我也决心和全体同志一样战胜困难，忍受艰苦，学习苏联红军为祖国艰苦奋战的精神，响应毛主席生产节约的号召，以我们的积极学习，英勇战斗，努力劳动，来肃清残敌解放全中国，粉碎敌人封锁，克服一切困难，向正规化现代化的国防军迈进，来建设我们的祖国，保卫我们的祖国。
