    Commercial Transformation in the Capital
    Necessities Flourish, Luxuries Decline

    [Report from this newspaper] In Beijing's private commerce, sectors beneficial to the people's livelihood have seen significant development since liberation. Conversely, industries selling luxuries or those not beneficial to the people's lives are gradually declining. According to statistics, since the People's Government began handling commercial registrations last March, a total of 5,434 businesses citywide have applied to the municipal government to open (4,898 approved), and 1,996 have applied to close (1,569 approved). Among those opening, the most numerous industries are coal shops, rice and flour, food, bicycles, paper and stationery, oil, salt and sundries, general merchandise, copper, iron, and tin, and fresh and dried fruits, totaling 2,735 businesses, accounting for 56% of the total approved openings. Among these, coal (583), rice and flour (420), and oil, salt and sundries (609) are the most numerous, totaling 1,612. The most obvious and largest number of businesses changing industries are those dealing in gold and silver jewelry. This industry saw a total of 116 businesses change, accounting for over 73% of the total number changing industries (157). In terms of changing into other industries, the most common choices were oil, salt and sundries, general merchandise, and paper and stationery. Furthermore, 43 gold and silver jewelry businesses applied to close. Businesses dealing in kerosene and imported goods have also largely ceased operations or switched to other industries due to sluggish business.

    首都商业在激变
    必需品行业获发展奢侈品行业正衰退
    【本报讯】在北京市私营商业中，与人民生活有益的部分，解放以来已有显著发展；相反，出售奢侈品或与人民生活无益的行业，正逐渐衰退。据统计，从去年三月人民政府办理商业登记以来，全市商家向市府申请开业的共五千四百三十四户（经批准者四千八百九十八户），申请歇业者一千九百九十六户（批准者一千五百六十九户）。在开业者中，以煤铺、米面杂粮、食品、自行车、纸张文具、油盐杂货、百货、铜铁锡、干鲜果品等行业为最多，共二千七百三十五户，占被批准开业户总数的百分之五十六；而上述行业中又以煤（五百八十三户）、米面杂粮（四百二十户）、油盐杂货（六百零九户）最多，共一千六百十二户。转业户中最明显且占数量最大的是金银饰物业。该行业全年共转出一百一十六户，占转出总数（一百五十七户）的百分之七十三强。转入方面也同样是以转到油盐杂货、百货、纸张文具、百货行业为多。金银饰物业并有四十三户申请歇业，煤油洋广等业也多因生意清淡而停止营业或转入其他行业。
