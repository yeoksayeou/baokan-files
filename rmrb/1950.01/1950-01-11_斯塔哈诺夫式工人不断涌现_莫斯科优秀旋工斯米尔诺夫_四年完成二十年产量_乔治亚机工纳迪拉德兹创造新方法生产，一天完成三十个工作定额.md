Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: TASS, Moscow dispatch: Smirnov, a lathe operator at the "Ilyich" factory in Moscow, has completed twenty years' worth of quota production within the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan. The amount of work he does each year is equivalent to what an average worker does in five years. He is an example of several thousand Stakhanovite workers and innovators in the Soviet Union who have greatly overfulfilled production plans.

Smirnov has been working at the "Ilyich" factory for thirteen years. He is an outstanding lathe operator who uses progressive working methods and has put forward dozens of rationalization proposals. He was originally a member of a collective farm in the Kalinin region. The attraction of machines brought him to the factory. In Soviet enterprises, there are all the conditions for developing workers' abilities and creative initiatives. They are able to learn and improve the quality of their work. Smirnov gradually transformed from a former apprentice into a highly skilled worker, and now everyone knows him as the "lathe engineer" of the factory.

The reason why Smirnov's work is so outstanding is not only due to the talent he has acquired over the years, but also because, as an advanced worker and a Communist Party member, he is constantly thinking about how to improve his lathe, how to increase its production capacity and improve the technical production process, and how to produce more. Before starting a new task, he carefully studies the drawings and determines the most rational way to use the machine. His achievements are immediately adopted by all workers engaged in the same work, making it easy to universally improve the labor productivity of the entire workshop.

Smirnov's name is known even outside his factory. He lectures on Stakhanovite working methods to students at electrical engineering schools, the Moscow Institute of Economics, and other educational institutions. Stalin said: Stakhanovite workers are educated people who are fully technically prepared, able to understand the time factor, do not stick to conventions, and boldly propose and adopt reforms regarding technical standards, predetermined production capacity, and economic plans. This statement fully applies to Smirnov.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 10th: TASS, Moscow dispatch: Nadiradze, a famous Stakhanovite worker at the Stalin Locomotive Repair Plant in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, has completed thirty work quotas in one day by applying his newly created method of welding locomotive cylinders and other complex engine parts. His daily wage has reached 1,114 rubles.

Sidingin, a well-known Stakhanovite drilling worker at the Bakalchik Mine in the Chelyabinsk region, has completed four to five work quotas by applying the multi-faceted drilling method. On January 3rd, he mined 600 tons of ore seedlings, which is fourteen times the required quota.

    莫斯科优秀旋工斯米尔诺夫
    四年完成二十年产量
    乔治亚机工纳迪拉德兹创造新方法生产，一天完成三十个工作定额
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科“伊里奇”工厂旋工斯米尔诺夫，在战后五年计划头四年内，已完成了二十年的定额产量。他每年所做的工作等于普通工人在五年内所做的。他是苏联的好几千个大量完成生产计划的斯塔哈诺夫式工人和革新者的一个例子。
    斯米尔诺夫在“伊里奇”工厂已工作了十三年，他是使用进步的劳动方法而且提出了好几十种合理化建议的出色的旋工。他本是加里宁州集体农场的成员。机器的吸引力使他来到工厂。在苏联企业中有着一切发展工人的能力与创造性倡议的条件。他们能够学习，提高他们的工作质量。斯米尔诺夫是由以前的学徒渐渐地变成非常熟练的工人，而现在谁都知道他是该工厂的“车床工程师”。
    斯米尔诺夫的工作所以做得很出色，不仅是由于他在若干年来所获得的才干，也是由于他作为先进工人和共产党员，他经常想着如何使他的车床更加完善，如何增加它的生产能力并改进技术生产过程，如何使生产得更多些。在开始新的任务之前，他小心翼翼地研究图样，定出使用机器的最合理的方法。他的成就立刻为一切从事同样工作的工人们所采用，使整个工作间的劳动生产率易于普遍提高。
    斯米尔诺夫的名字连他的工厂以外的人们都知道了。他向电机学校、莫斯科经济学院及其他教育机关的学生们，讲授关于斯塔哈诺夫工作方法的课程。斯大林说：斯塔哈诺夫式工人是这样一些有教养的人，他们有充分技术准备，能够懂得时间的因素，不墨守陈规，大胆地提出并采用关于技术标准、预定的生产能力及经济计划的改革。这句话完全适用于斯米尔诺夫。
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：乔治亚首都第比利斯斯大林机车修理场的著名斯塔哈诺夫式工人纳迪拉德兹，应用他所创造的焊接机车汽缸和其他复杂引擎机件的新方法，使他在一日之内完成了三十个工作定额，他每日的工资已达一千一百一十四卢布。
    车里雅宾斯克州巴卡尔契克矿场有名的斯塔哈诺夫式钻孔工人西丁金，由于应用多面钻孔法而完成了四至五个工作定额。在一月三日，他挖出了六百吨矿苗，为定额所要求的十四倍。
