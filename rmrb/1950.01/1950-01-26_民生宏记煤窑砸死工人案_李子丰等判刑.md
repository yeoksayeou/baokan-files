    Minsheng Hongji Coal Mine Worker Death Case
    Li Zifeng and Others Sentenced
    [Beijing News] The privately owned Mentougou Minsheng Hongji Coal Mine violated government decrees by secretly taking back coal and removing coal pillars. In September of last year, this led to the deaths of thirteen workers and injuries to fourteen workers. The case has been adjudicated by the Municipal People's Court. Li Zifeng, the foreman of the mine, bore the direct responsibility for directing workers in coal mining operations. On September 17th of last year, disregarding the safety of the workers, he allowed them to mine in dangerous areas and blast coal pillars, causing the mine roof to collapse, killing workers Luo Yutian and thirteen others, and injuring workers Liu Fa and fourteen others. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yang Zhipu, the manager of the mine, was found guilty of dereliction of duty, disregarding the lives of workers, and failing to ensure the competence of the foreman or the safety of equipment. He neglected to inspect, causing massive casualties, and was sentenced to three years in prison. At the same time, in order to support the injured workers and console the families of the deceased, the government specifically ordered the Minsheng Hongji Coal Mine to provide each of the deceased workers' families with 4,000 catties of millet for funeral and compensation expenses, to be received by the families of the deceased; and to bear all medical expenses and living expenses for the injured workers during their recovery period.
