    Report to Chairman Mao on Production and Disaster Relief
    A Letter from Village Cadres and Party Members of Liucun, Anxin County, Hebei
    [This newspaper reports] Liucun village in Anxin County, Hebei Province, is located near Baiyangdian Lake. The village's north side is Dawangdian, a low-lying area, and this year's flood was severe. However, under the strong leadership of the village cadres and Party branch members, the masses overcame various difficulties, corrected their reliance mentality, consolidated their production morale, and launched a production self-salvation movement. On the eve of the New Year of 1950, all village cadres, Party members, and the masses joyfully summarized the production and disaster relief work of the past six months, and unanimously agreed to write a letter to Chairman Mao as a New Year's gift. Below is their letter:

Please forward it to our beloved Chairman Mao:

The first New Year of our People's Republic of China has gloriously arrived, and we are very happy and joyful. It's a pity that we don't have anything valuable to give as a gift to wish you a Happy New Year, so we'll just report to you on our village's production and disaster relief work over the past six months as our New Year's gift.

Our village has 286 households, 2,411 people, and 6,966 mu of land. This year, except for some reeds harvested from over 1,200 mu of reed fields, no grain was harvested. Now, all the land is still submerged in water five to twelve feet deep. Before the flood, people's production enthusiasm was very high. Girls of sixteen or seventeen and old men in their seventies were all transplanting rice seedlings, covered in mud, and everyone's face was full of smiles as they looked at the rice seedlings taller than a person's head, sprouting white flowers and emitting a fragrant smell. Everyone said, "This year's harvest will be good!" Who knew that on the tenth day of the eighth lunar month, the Zhao Village dike breached for more than sixty zhang, and our beloved crops were submerged, as if our hearts were submerged as well. The water was three feet deep inside and outside the houses, and men and women were crying and panicking. The cadres were also momentarily anxious and confused. In such a serious situation, the branch held an emergency meeting to discuss emergency measures: first, move the households on the edge of the village into the village to avoid danger. At the same time, broadcast from the rooftops to stabilize the masses' emotions and expose the backward thinking of some masses who thought this was "divine water" and were waiting to die. Gao Chunhe, the branch secretary, solemnly said to everyone at the branch meeting, "Chairman Mao teaches us that when Communist Party members encounter a crisis, they must stand up and think of ways to overcome all difficulties and lead the people to victory." After saying this, everyone's spirits were boosted. Branch Secretary Gao Chunhe, Village Chief Liu Jingbo, and four others boarded a large door panel, pushed through the floodwaters, and swam to Liu Shucang's house in Wangtou Village to the north. They mobilized him to take the lead in collecting 64 old fishing nets, organized eight-person fishing teams, rented two boats from Majiazai, and began fishing in the river. On the first day, they caught 500 jin of fish, which at that time could be exchanged for eight dou of corn per 100 jin. We seized this example to educate the masses, held mass meetings and Party member meetings, and conducted extensive propaganda. The nine branch committee members and four cadres were divided into three-person groups, each responsible for specific tasks such as fishing, weaving, cooperatives, and sales. They also contacted each other to carry out production activities. The initial difficulty was that the masses had no confidence in production, felt that they lacked everything, and even if they produced, they were afraid there would be no sales outlets. "Let fate decide!" Some lacked funds and requested loans from the government, believing that they could not produce without loans. According to instructions from higher authorities, the branch studied the situation and adopted a cooperative approach, mobilizing private capital. "Those with strength contribute strength, those with nets contribute nets, those with grain contribute grain." In addition, private loans were made, and the slogan "Dead objects must be turned into living objects" was put forward. Party member Liu Tonghai borrowed eight dou of grain from his aunt's house, and Wei Lingqun and eight others each took out five dou of wheat. Some borrowed grain from other villages, and some sold unnecessary furniture, etc. In this way, they gradually organized eight large net teams and two small net teams. In order to consolidate the masses' production morale, more than fifty Party members participated in each group to play a core role. From then on, production began to develop. A total of 152 people in the village were engaged in fishing and shrimping, catching 3,100 jin of fish and shrimp every day, which could be exchanged for 25 shi of corn. This led 148 people to sell fish, earning two dou of corn in five days. Five thousand jin of water chestnuts were transported to Tianjin, and four households exchanged them for 15,000 jin of corn. In addition, 320 women were mobilized to weave, weaving 9.6 zhang of nets every day, which could be exchanged for 3 shi and 2 dou of corn. In addition, a cooperative was organized, with 270 households investing 20 shi of corn, and a boat was allocated specifically for transporting daily necessities for the masses. In the past five months, the cooperative has regulated 40 shi of grain, 2,000 jin of salt, 300 packages of matches, 300 jin of blood dye for nets, and some miscellaneous goods.

After the river froze and became impassable, the People's Government provided 5,000 jin of grain as a loan to help us organize two winter net teams. Now, 174 people in the village are engaged in fishing, producing an average of 2,000 jin of fish per day, which can be exchanged for more than 10 shi of grain. Selling fish, transportation, women's weaving, and matting, the village can earn more than 30 shi of corn every day.

In the past six months, thanks to the correct leadership of higher authorities and the efforts of the people of the entire village, more than 380 households, except for 43 households with 186 people who moved to the Northeast and other counties, have maintained their livelihoods. They have also acquired 5,694 zhang of new nets, 800 jin of mat ropes, built five new boats, bought fifteen boats, and rented fifty boats. More than fifty households in the village have even had a surplus in their lives. For example, the Yang Shizong and Li Xuan families, with nine people, the men fish and the women weave. In addition to food, they have a surplus of two shi of grain per month. The 52 households of revolutionary martyrs, military families, and workers' families are all doing well because they all have reed fields. The twelve households of orphans, widows, the elderly, and the weak, with 33 people, have more difficult lives. In addition to the government providing grain relief every month, seven households have been organized to collect manure, which has also solved part of their living problems.

This spring, we plan to organize fourteen large and small fishing teams, involving 120 households, 70 households using other methods to catch fish and shrimp, 70 households selling fish and transporting goods, and 80 households repairing dikes to earn wages. We will further organize spinning to ensure that the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers are not difficult. Now we are preparing the tools and rice seeds for this spring.

In the past six months of production and disaster relief work, we deeply feel that with your leadership, Chairman Mao, difficulties can be overcome. Especially when you told us that Communist Party members are capable of overcoming all difficulties. The province's proposal of self-salvation through production showed us a bright path in the midst of chaos. We took this path and achieved today's production results in our village, and the people's lives are now guaranteed. The people of our village often say, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, we would have worried ourselves to death." How can we repay Chairman Mao's kindness? Everyone said, "Let's take advantage of the opportunity to wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year and report on our production situation to him!"

Respectfully wishing
You good health in the New Year.

The entire village cadres and Party members of Liucun, Anxin County, Hebei Province, bowing on behalf of all the villagers.

December 28, 1949

### 向毛主席报告生产救灾  河北安新县留村干部和党员的一封信

    向毛主席报告生产救灾
    河北安新县留村干部和党员的一封信
    【本报讯】河北省安新县留村，在白洋淀附近。村北是大王淀，地势低洼，今年水灾很严重。但该村群众在村干部及支部党员的坚强领导下，克服了种种困难，纠正了依赖思想，巩固了生产情绪，开展了生产自救运动。一九五○年新年前夕，全体村干部、党员及群众，愉快的总结了半年来的生产救灾工作，一致通过：写信报告给毛主席，作为新年献礼。下边就是他们的来信：请转给亲爱的毛主席：
    咱中华人民共和国头一个新年，光辉的来到了，我们非常欢欣快乐。可惜我们没有什么贵重的东西来作礼物，向你拜年，就把俺村半年来的生产救灾工作，向你作一报告，就当作我们的新年献礼吧。
    俺村二百八十六户，两千四百十一口人，六千九百六十六亩地。今年除了一千二百多亩苇田收些苇子，其余颗粒没收。现在全部土地还泡在五尺到十二尺深的水里。没闹水灾前，人们生产情绪可高哩，十六七岁的女孩子，七十多岁的老头儿，都拖浆带水的插稻秧，大家望着高过人顶吐着白花花的穗子，吹着香喷喷气味的稻苗，满脸露笑。大家都说：“今年可收好了！”谁知道，八月初十那天，赵村大堤决口六十多丈，俺们心爱的禾苗淹没了，好象淹了人的心一样。屋里院里，水深三尺，男女哭哭涕涕，慌做一团，干部也一时着急的懵头转向。在这样严重的时候，支部召开了紧急会议，商量应急的办法：先把村边住户移到村里来，免去危险。一面在屋顶广播，安定群众情绪，揭发某些群众认为这是神水，和等死的落后思想。支部书记高春和，在支部会上，严肃的向大家说：“毛主席教导我们：共产党员遇到危急的时候，要挺身而起，从灾难里想出办法，领导人民战胜一切困难。”这么一说，大家的精神奋发起来。支书高春和、村长刘静波等四个人，登着一扇大门板，拨开洪水，就凫到村北网头刘树仓家。动员他为首，搜集了六十四张旧鱼网，组织了八人一班的渔班，从马家寨赁来了两只船，开始下河打鱼。第一天就治了五百斤鱼，当时每百斤鱼换八斗玉米。我们抓住这个例子，教育群众，召开了群众会、党员会，广泛宣传。九个支委和四个干部，每三人一组，按治鱼、纺织、合作社、运销等具体分工，各负专责。又互相联系，进行生产活动。开始遇到的困难，是群众对生产没信心，觉得少这无那，就是生产了，也怕没销路，“听天由命”吧！还有的缺乏资金，要求政府贷款，认为不贷款就没法生产。根据上级指示，支部里作了研究，俺们采用合作方式，发动私资，“有力的出力，有网的出网，有粮的出粮”，加上私人借贷，还提出“死物要变成活物”的口号，党员刘同海，由姑姑家借了八斗粮，魏苓群等八人，每人拿出五斗麦子，有的由外村借的粮，有的卖些不必要的家具等，这样凑起来，陆续组织了大网八班，小网两班。为了巩固群众的生产情绪，五十多个党员，分别参加到各组，起核心作用。从此，生产就开展起来了。全村治鱼、虾的共一百五十二人，每天治鱼、虾三千一百斤，能换二十五石玉米；带动一百四十八人卖鱼，五天能挣二斗玉米；运到天津去五千斤菱角，四户换了一万五千斤玉米。还发动了三百二十个妇女纺织，每天织网九丈六尺，能换三石二斗玉米。另外组织了合作社，二百七十户入股二十石玉米，拨船一只专运群众日用品。五个月来，调剂粮食四十石，盐二千斤，三百包火柴，三百斤染网血料，还有一些杂货。
    地冻河封了以后，人民政府以五千斤贷粮，帮助俺们组织了两个冬网班。现在全村有一百七十四人治鱼，平均每天出两千斤鱼，能换十多石粮。卖鱼、运销、妇女纺织连编席等，全村每天能收入三十多石玉米。
    这半年来，经过上级的正确领导，和全村人们的努力，三百八十多户人家，除了迁移到东北和外县的四十三户一百八十六口人外，都维持住了生活。还置下了五千六百九十四丈新网，八百斤席绳，排新船五只买船十五只，赁船五十只。全村五十多户生活还有了剩余。像杨世宗、李宣两户九口人，男的治鱼，女的纺织，除了吃的，每月还余两石粮。五十二户烈、军、工属，因为他们都有苇田，生活都很好。十二户孤寡老弱，三十三人，生活比较困难，除了政府每月发粮救济外，组织了七户拾大粪，也解决一部分生活问题。
    今年开春，我们计划组织大小渔班十四班，能参加一百二十户，用其他办法治鱼虾的七十户，卖鱼和运销的七十户，修堤挣工资的八十户，进一步组织纺线，保证烈军工属生活不困难。现在我们就正准备今年春天的用具和稻种。
    这半年来的生产救灾工作，我们深深的感觉到，有了毛主席你的领导，困难就能克服。特别是你告诉我们：共产党员是能战胜一切困难的。省里提出生产自救，这就是在慌乱中指给我们的一条光明大道。我们走了这条道，才有了俺村今天的生产成绩，群众生活才有了保障。我村老百姓常常念叨：“要不是毛主席，愁也得把人们愁死。”怎样报答毛主席的恩情呢，大家说：“趁着向毛主席拜年的机会，顺便把咱们的生产情况报告给他吧！”
                                                  敬祝
    你新年健康  河北省安新县留村全体村干部和党员代表全村人等鞠躬
    一九四九年十二月二十八日
