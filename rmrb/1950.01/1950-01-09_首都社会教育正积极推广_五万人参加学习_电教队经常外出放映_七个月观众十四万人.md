    [Beijing News] Social education in the capital has achieved initial success. The Municipal Education Bureau, through various means such as night schools, literacy classes, winter schools, libraries, People's Education Halls, newspaper and reading rooms, schools for the deaf and mute, vocational training schools, as well as physical education teams and electro-education work teams, is conducting supplementary education in political thought, cultural technology, and physical health for the working people and the general public (including youth and children).

    In the past, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule gave the working people and their children few opportunities for education. At the beginning of Beijing's liberation, according to incomplete statistics, illiterate children and adults over the age of seven accounted for 50% of the total population. After liberation, the People's Government, adhering to the policy of vigorously developing adult and working people's education, gradually carried out the work of eliminating illiteracy. At present, more than 400 adult night schools have been opened in the urban area, with more than 15,500 working people such as vendors, shop assistants, and ordinary citizens (including women) participating in the study. In addition to the planned allocation of more than 10,000 children of working people with considerable education to middle and primary schools in the city, 186 children's supplementary schools have been established in various districts, educating more than 20,000 out-of-school children. In the suburbs, in addition to educating farmers in conjunction with land reform, winter schools have been held, with more than 15,000 people participating in the study.

    After liberation, the urban district's People's Education Hall added a large number of new books to enrich the reading room, added blackboards, held photo exhibitions, mass evening parties, public lectures, set up mobile book boxes, inquiry offices, and held various training courses. In addition, the People's Education Hall also assisted shop employees and workers in rehearsing dramas, and opened up recreation rooms to lead the cultural and recreational activities of workers and the general public. The work of the suburban People's Education Halls has also made considerable progress, such as: Mentougou has a workers' recreation department; Gaobeidian has a farmers' cooperative, a farmer's sideline training class, and a work-study group; Changxindian has a literacy class.

    After liberation, the number of people reading books in libraries and reading rooms has continued to increase. According to statistics from the Social Education Section of the Municipal Education Bureau, nearly 120,000 people visited the Municipal Library last year; since liberation, the total number of readers in the city's seven reading rooms has been more than 235,800.

    The city also has special schools for the deaf, mute, blind, and other disabled people. The Municipal School for the Deaf and Mute has vocational learning subjects such as weaving, knitting, wood carving, sewing, and tailoring, which students can freely choose to learn a skill.

    In terms of film and broadcasting education, the Municipal Education Bureau's electro-education team often goes out to show films, mainly to workers' night schools, children's supplementary schools, and mass evening parties held by the People's Education Hall. From May 1st to the beginning of December last year, a total of 121 screenings were held, with an audience of more than 140,000 people.

    In order to promote workers' recreational activities, the Municipal Education Bureau organized physical education teachers from middle and primary schools to go to various factories to teach folk dances, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, and other sports activities.

    【北京讯】首都的社会教育已获得了初步成绩。市教育局通过夜校、识字班、冬学、图书馆、人民教育馆、书报阅览室、聋哑学校、职业补习学校、以及体育工作队和电化教育工作队等各种方式，对劳动人民及一般市民（包括青年、儿童）进行着政治思想及文化技术的补习教育和体育保健工作。
    过去国民党的反动统治使劳动人民及其子弟很少有受教育的机会。北京解放之初，据不完全统计，全市七岁以上的失学儿童及成人文盲占总人口百分之五十。解放后人民政府本着大力开展成人及劳动人民教育的方针，逐步进行扫除文盲的工作。目前在城区已开办了四百多班成人夜校，参加学习的劳动人民如小贩、店员及一般市民（包括妇女）共一万五千五百多人。此外，除有计划地把有相当文化程度的劳动人民子弟一万多人分配到市内各中、小学外，并在各区设立了儿童补习学校共有一百八十六所，教育着二万多失学的儿童。在郊区，除结合土地改革对农民进行教育外，又举办了冬学，参加学习的已有一万五千多人。
    解放后，市区民众教育馆增添了大批新书以充实阅览室，并增设黑板报，举行照片展览会、群众晚会、大众讲座，设置巡回书箱、问事处及举办各种补习班等。此外民教馆还协助店员工人排剧，增辟游艺室以领导工人及一般市民的文娱活动。郊区民教馆的工作也有不少开展，如：门头沟有工人康乐部；高碑店有农民合作社、农民副业训练班、工学团；长辛店有识字班。
    解放后，到图书馆及阅览室看书的人数，不断增加，据市教育局社会教育科统计：去年到市立图书馆阅览的人数近十二万人；解放以来，全市七个阅览室的总阅览人数为二十三万五千八百多人。
    本市对聋、哑、盲等残废人也设有特殊的学校，其中市立聋哑学校附设有职业学习科目如纺织、针织、木刻、缝纫和剪裁等，由学生自由选择，以便学得一技之长。
    电影与广播教育，市教育局电教队经常外出放映，对象主要是工人夜校、儿童补习学校及人民教育馆举办的群众晚会等。自去年五月一日至十二月初，共放映一百二十一次，观众约十四万余人。
    为促进工人康乐活动，市教育局曾组织了中、小学体育教员，赴各工厂教授扭秧歌、打篮排球、体操等各项体育活动。
