Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th: To encourage the inland relocation of coastal factories to be closer to raw materials and markets, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, has implemented preferential measures for railway transportation for the inland relocation of coastal factories, effective from January 2nd. The measures stipulate that for coastal factories relocating inland, to areas west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway in North China, to areas west of the provincial borders of Anhui and eastern Jiangxi in Central China, and to areas north of the provincial borders of Jiangxi, Hunan, and southern Guizhou in South China, railway freight for the factory's machinery, ancillary furniture, and equipment (full carloads of 30 tons) will be reduced by half, provided they hold a certificate from the local financial and economic committee of the factory's location. However, this reduction does not apply to finished products, semi-finished products, or raw materials. For shorter-distance inland relocations exceeding 150 kilometers but not within the aforementioned regions, freight will be reduced by 25 percent. General factory relocations will still be charged according to railway freight rates, but if there are special reasons, the factory owner may detail the reasons and request the Ministry of Railways to review and approve a discretionary reduction in freight.
