    [Reported by this Newspaper] Most of the public factories in Ningxia City, Ningxia Province, and Xining City, Qinghai Province, in the Northwest have resumed production. After liberation, due to the new attitude of the workers towards labor, the production volume of some factories has exceeded the pre-liberation levels. The comparatively large Limin Machinery Flour Mill in Ningxia City resumed production on the second day after liberation. Before liberation, the factory had a total of 88 employees, with an average daily output of 130 bags of flour, and a peak output of 304 bags. After liberation, with 76 employees, the average daily output was 310 bags, with a record high of 374 bags. The Ningxia Machinery Factory was forced to stop work in July last year due to a shortage of raw materials and the destruction caused by Ma bandits. After liberation, the workers actively tried to solve the difficulties of fuel and raw materials, picking coal blocks from the used waste coal, sending people to collect scrap copper and iron, and buying coal from other places. It officially resumed work on October 3, temporarily producing mold casings and saw blades. In the past, the factory smelted about 1,500 catties of iron per day; now it smelts 2,400 catties of iron per day, an increase of 60% compared to before. Under the same conditions, the Lining Paper Mill has increased its newsprint production from 30 knives per day (100 sheets per knife) before liberation to 32 knives, with a maximum of 52 knives. In addition, the Ningxia Electric Light Company, repair shops, leather clothing factories, leather factories, military uniform factories, and automobile maintenance factories have all successively resumed production, with both production scale and efficiency improved compared to pre-liberation. After the Xining Military Control Commission took over the machinery, chemical, carpet, leather, coal mine, clothing and other factories and power plants belonging to the Northwest Industrial and Mining Company of the Ma Bufang bureaucratic capital in early September last year, thanks to the joint efforts of cadres and workers, all factories were taken over by October 25 last year and began to resume production. When the Ma bandits fled in a panic, they burned a large number of files and documents from the factories and took the opportunity to loot and transport cash and property. Except for the power plant, which was protected by the workers and suffered no losses, most of the other factories were in ruins. After the Military Control Commission took over, it first summoned the workers from each factory to return to the factory and organized a resumption committee in each factory, including workers, engineers, and staff, to repair the machinery and houses, and collect lost raw materials and equipment. Through continuous education, the workers' political awareness has been generally improved. After the Qinghai People's Industrial and Mining Bureau was officially established in early October, it unified the leadership of the work of the factories and gradually restored the production organization of the factories. As of now, the output of leather, carpets, and other factories has increased compared to pre-liberation levels. Leather factory workers who scrape sheepskin used to scrape 15 skins per person per day, but now they scrape 20 skins. Carpet factory workers used to weave 40 square inches per person per day, but now they can weave 80 square inches per person per day. Currently, the workers in each factory are actively discussing and formulating factory rules, labor discipline, and reward and punishment systems to better carry out production.

    西北宁夏、西宁两市公营工厂大部复工生产
    已有部分工厂超过解放前生产水平
    【本报讯】西北宁夏省宁夏、青海省西宁两市公营工厂已大部复工生产，解放后由于职工树立了新的劳动态度，有的厂生产量已超过解放前的水平。宁夏市规模较大的利民机器面粉厂，解放后第二天即复工生产。该厂解放前职工共八十八人，平均日产一百三十袋面粉，最高产量曾达到三百零四袋，解放后职工七十六人，平均日产量三百一十袋，最高纪录达三百七十四袋。宁夏机器厂解放前因原料缺乏，又遭受马匪摧残破坏，去年七月间被迫停工，解放后职工即积极想法解决燃料和原料困难，在已用过的废炭中拣炭块，派人到各地搜集破铜烂铁，到外地买煤。十月三日已正式复工，暂生产锅模子及锯条。该厂过去每日化铁一千五百斤左右，现在每天化铁二千四百斤，较前增加了百分之六十。利宁造纸厂在同样条件下，新闻纸已由解放前日产三十刀（每刀一百张）增至三十二刀，最高达五十二刀。此外，宁夏电灯公司、修械所、皮衣厂、皮革厂、军服厂、汽车保养厂等均已先后恢复生产，不论在生产规模与效率上，均较解放前提高。西宁市军管会于去年九月初接管马匪步芳官僚资本原西北工矿公司所属的机器、化工、地毯、皮革、煤矿、被服等厂及电厂后，由于干部和职工们的共同努力，至去年十月二十五日各厂均先后接管完毕，并开始恢复生产。按马匪狼狈逃窜时，曾将各厂档案、文卷大量焚烧，并乘机将现金财物等卷运逃走，全市除电厂在职工保护下未受损失外，其他各厂大都残缺不堪。军管会接管后，即首先召集各厂工人回厂，并在各厂组织包括工人、工程师、职员的复工委员会，整顿机器、房舍、及收集失散原料器材。通过不断教育，工人政治觉悟普遍提高。十月初青海人民工矿局正式成立后，统一领导各厂工作，逐渐恢复了各厂生产组织。截至目前，皮革、地毯等厂产量均较解放前增加，皮革厂铲羊皮工人过去每人每日铲十五张，现在则增至二十张，地毯厂工人过去每人每日栽四十方寸，现在每人每天可栽八十方寸。现各厂工人正积极讨论制定厂规、劳动纪律、奖惩制度等，以便更好地进行生产。
