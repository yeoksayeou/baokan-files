    "The 'Russian Question' Exposes the War Cries of American Plutocrats"
    Méi Lìngyí
    This is what we already know about the United States: on the one hand, it is the America belonging to the Wall Street plutocrats, ruled by the likes of Truman, Marshall, and MacArthur; on the other hand, it is the America of the people who are still being exploited, enslaved, and deceived, and who are struggling for genuine freedom and people's democracy. The film "The Russian Question," written by Simonov, directed by Romm, and starring Aksyonov (as Harry Smith) and Kuzmina (as Jessie), can be said to be the first to expose the true face of the plutocrats' America through the art of film.
    The story itself illustrates this point: in the America of the plutocrats, public opinion, as seen in newspapers, is completely manipulated by the likes of McPherson, who are loyal to their own clique. He owns thirty-eight newspapers. He can publish outright lies in the first edition, and put the rebuttal on the twentieth. When the bookseller Kessler wants to publish Smith's work, McPherson uses the threat of all thirty-eight newspapers attacking every publication of Kessler's, forcing the latter to abandon the plan. Harry Smith also lost his job under this kind of monopoly.
    However, "The Russian Question" does more than just expose this point. It has a deeper significance. This is manifested in why McPherson insists that Harry Smith write such a book: "The Russians Need War."
    The plutocratic America is facing an increasingly severe economic crisis since 1946. In order to save their own fate, the plutocrats have no choice but to expand outwards, clamoring against the Soviet Union and attempting to provoke another war. (At the same time, they are strengthening fascist suppression of the American people.) Whether it's expansion, anti-Sovietism, or another war, the plutocrats themselves won't go; they want to use deception to drive millions of American people to sacrifice their lives for them, thereby alleviating domestic contradictions and reaping huge war profits while sitting back and enjoying the spoils. For them, a book like "The Russians Need War" is absolutely necessary. Moreover, it is also very necessary to have it written by Harry Smith, who wrote a book about the Soviet Union during the war against Germany, thus utilizing readers' trust in Smith to strengthen the deception. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union that Smith saw again was completely contrary to McPherson's subjective demands. The Soviet Union was carrying out peaceful construction and showed no sign of needing war, and had not even thought about it. Thus, when McPherson read Smith's original manuscript, he was so angry because Smith had not followed his orders to slander the Soviet Union that he could no longer maintain the hypocritical facade of a gentleman and became like a mad dog.
    As early as three years ago, the stage play of "The Russian Question" emphasized the only correct answer to this question. As the Czech Prague's "Youth Front Daily" said, "The Russian Question" not only exposed the bloody face of American imperialism, but also encouraged the forces that are fighting for human peace, striving for social equality, believing in socialism, and believing in the Soviet Union today. In the past three years, the forces striving for lasting peace and people's democracy have been growing day by day. The cries of the American plutocrats have not stopped and will become even more frenzied. But, we have already heard the anxiety and despair in their cries.

    “俄罗斯问题”暴露了美国财阀们的战争叫嚣
    梅令宜
    这是我们已经知道的，美国：一方面是属于华尔街财阀们通过杜鲁门、马歇尔、麦克阿瑟辈所统治的美国；一方面是属于迄今为止仍然被剥削、被奴役、被欺骗并为真正自由与人民民主而进行着斗争的人民的美国。西蒙诺夫编剧、罗姆导演、由阿克歇诺夫（饰哈利·斯密特）和库齐明娜（饰洁西）等主演的电影《俄罗斯问题》，可以说是第一次通过电影艺术，揭穿了财阀们的美国的真实面目。
    故事本身就说明了这个问题：在财阀们的美国里，舆论见于报纸中的，完完全全操纵在效忠于自己那一伙的麦克菲森辈的手里的。他拥有三十八家报纸。他可以把彻头彻尾是谣言的《新闻》刊登在第一版上，而把辟谣的文章登在第二十版上。当书商凯斯勒要出版斯密特的著作的时候，麦克菲森就利用三十八家报纸将一齐来攻击凯斯勒的每一出版物的威吓使后者不能不放弃这个计划。哈利·斯密特也就是在这种垄断之下失去了职业的。
    然而，“俄罗斯问题”还不只是暴露了这一点。它有着更深刻的意义。这表现在麦克菲森为什么一定要哈利·斯密特写这么一本书：《俄国人需要战争》。
    财阀的美国面临着自一九四六年起日渐严重的经济危机。财阀们为了挽救自己的命运，只有向外扩张，叫嚣着反苏，企图挑起再一次战争。（同时，对于美国人民，则加强了法西斯的镇压。）扩张也好，反苏也好，再一次战争也好，反正财阀们自己是不去的，他们要用欺骗手段来驱使千百万美国人民为他们牺牲性命，从而缓和了国内矛盾，坐享其成的获得巨大的战争利润。对于他们，“俄国人需要战争”这一本书是非常必要的。而且，由曾经在对德战争时期写过一本关于苏联的书的哈利·斯密特来写，即利用读者对于斯密特的信任来加强欺骗，也是非常必要的。不幸，再度在苏联的斯密特所看见的苏联，完完全全与麦克菲森主观要求相反，苏联正在进行和平建设，没有一点需要战争的迹象，甚至也想也没有想过这一回事。于是，当麦克菲森读了斯密特的原稿，由于斯密特不曾遵照他的命令去污蔑苏联之故，他气得不能再保持绅士的虚伪架子，竟像一条疯狗了。
    早在三年以前，“俄罗斯问题”的舞台剧就强调的做出了这个问题的唯一的正确的答案。如捷克布拉格《青年战线报》所说的，“俄罗斯问题”不只将美帝国主义的血腥面目揭露了，而且鼓舞了今天为人类和平斗争、争取社会平等、坚信社会主义、坚信苏联的力量。三年来的争取持久和平与争取人民民主的力量，正是一天一天的增涨着的。美国财阀们的叫嚣并不曾停止，还要叫得更狂呢。但，我们已经听得叫嚣中的焦灼与绝望了。
