    Hebei Province's Six Million Cadres Regularize Various Studies
    Levels A and B Have Completed Political Economics; 150 Cultural Remedial Schools Established
    [This newspaper reports] The on-the-job cadre study in Hebei Province has become regularized. Last year, 59,917 cadres throughout the province participated in studies. Levels A and B cadres have completed the History of Social Development, Political Economics, and the fourteen types of temporary study materials stipulated by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and various local Party committees. Through theoretical study, the vast majority of cadres have gained a clearer understanding of the basic laws of social development and the historical materialist viewpoint of the working people creating history; the gains from the study of current events and policies have led to a profound understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism; and a correct understanding and experience of the United Front issue of the Chinese Revolution has been gained, correcting some erroneous viewpoints. In the implementation of specific policies, most areas are improving their work while studying. Shijiazhuang City, through earnest study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," successfully convened the People's Congress; Anping Eighth District consistently implemented the study of various policy documents related to agricultural production, powerfully guiding the production work throughout the year. Among the level C cadres with lower levels of education, through cultural studies, many previously illiterate cadres can now recognize three to five hundred characters and can write simple letters; those who originally only knew five to six hundred characters can now write simple work reports. In some districts of Pingshan, Anping, Wuqiang, Gaoyi, and other counties, illiteracy has been eliminated among the district cadres.
    Study organizations have become increasingly sound. Party committees at all levels in various regions have strengthened the leadership of on-the-job cadre studies, taking the Party committee's propaganda departments as the core, absorbing key cadres from various departments who can take practical responsibility, establishing study committees at all levels, and organizing branches and sub-branches according to the number of people in the organization, dividing into groups to carry out studies. From the provincial-level organizations to some counties and towns, a regular study system has been established, and generally, two hours of study can be maintained daily; some departments at the provincial level and in the Cangxian Special District have also implemented systems for cadre study attendance, roll call, awarding prizes, and assessing study results.

    河北全省六万干部  各项学习走向正规
    甲乙两级已学完政治经济学  建立文化补习学校百五十处
    【本报讯】河北全省的在职干部学习已走向正规。去年一年中，全省五万九千九百一十七名干部参加了学习，甲乙级干部已学完社会发展史、政治经济学和中共河北省委与各地委规定的十四种临时学习材料。通过理论学习，绝大多数干部更明确了社会发展的基本规律和劳动人民创造历史的历史唯物观点；时事政策学习的收获，是对美帝国主义的侵略本质有了深刻的认识；对中国革命统一战线问题有了正确的了解和体验，纠正了一些错误观点。在具体政策执行上，大部地区是一面学习一面提高着工作，石家庄市认真学习了《论人民民主专政》，就开好了人民代表大会；安平八区始终贯彻着有关农业生产的各种政策文件的学习，有力地指导了全年的生产工作。丙级中文化程度较低的干部，通过文化学习，不少从前不识字的干部现在识到三五百字，能写简单的信了；原来只识五六百字的，已能写简单的工作报告。平山、安平、武强、高邑等县有些区，区干部中已经消灭了文盲。
    学习组织已日趋健全。各地区中共各级党委都加强了在职干部学习的领导，以党委宣传部门为核心，吸收各部门能负实际责任的主要干部，建立起各级学委会，并按机关人数多少组织分会和支会，分别划分小组展开学习，从省级机关到一部分县镇，已建立了经常的学习制度，一般都能坚持每日两小时的学习；省级和沧县专区有些部门，还实行了干部学习的考勤、点名、评奖和考核学习成绩等制度。
