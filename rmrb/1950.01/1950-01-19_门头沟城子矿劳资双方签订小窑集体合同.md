    [Beijing News] Representatives of the Chengzi Small Mine Union in Mentougou, Beijing, and the Mentougou Chengzi Mining Federation, representing both labor and management, formally signed a collective labor-management contract for small coal mines (excluding mechanized mining) on the 14th. The full text is as follows:
    Representatives of the Chengzi Small Mine Union in Mentougou, Beijing, and representatives of the Mining Federation, in order to resolve existing disputes between labor and management and to achieve the goal of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, have agreed, based on past practices and current conditions, to sign the following collective contract:

    A. Back Carrying Labor Wage Standard: Generally, 150 "tao" (a unit of distance related to digging) of tunnel passage is the standard. The minimum wage is 35% of the Mentougou selling price of raw coal carried by the individual (should be calculated in kind, settled once per shift, and at most no more than three days). For those exceeding this tunnel passage distance, the wage will increase accordingly, and it will be negotiated by both parties according to the actual conditions of each tunnel (such as the quality of the working area). However, the scales must be accurate according to the old scales, and no extra additions or subtractions are allowed.
    B. Long-term Workers (staff, miscellaneous workers) Minimum monthly wage is 150 "jin" of rice, paid every half month (wage rice is 70% "Fudi" millet and 30% "Kou" millet, calculated according to the average price of retail and wholesale published in the People's Daily on that day).

    B. If an employee is injured at work and becomes disabled, the labor union and the employer shall negotiate the handling according to the severity of the injury. The minimum amount of disability compensation shall be 1500 "jin" of millet. If the employee has the ability to work, the employer should try to arrange employment.
    C. If an employee is injured at work, the employer shall bear all medical expenses, and long-term workers shall continue to receive their wages. Short-term workers shall receive a living allowance of 10, 8, or 6 "jin" of millet per day, based on first, second, and third class, respectively. Specific measures can be determined by the labor union and the employer after doctor's certification.

Employees on sick leave for one month or less shall receive full pay, those on sick leave for more than one month but less than three months shall receive half pay, and those on sick leave for more than three months shall retain their position but receive no pay.

    Article 5: The employer has the right to hire and dismiss employees, and the labor party has the right to terminate the contract, but the following principles must be observed:
    A. If the employer needs to dismiss long-term employees due to business reasons, unless otherwise agreed, they shall be given one to three months of actual wages (including meal expenses) as severance pay based on their length of service, and the dismissed employees and the labor union must be notified fifteen days before the dismissal. However, in the event of a mine collapse, the employer shall not take this opportunity to dismiss employees, and their treatment shall remain the same as usual.
    B. If the employer dismisses an employee due to the employee's fault, the dismissed employee and the labor union must be notified five days in advance.
    C. The labor union has the right to protest if it considers the employer's dismissal unreasonable. If the employer does not accept the protest, it may appeal to the Labor Bureau for resolution.
    D. If an employee terminates the contract midway, the employer and the labor union must be notified five days in advance.
