    Ancient Precious Bronze
    “Guo Ji Zi Bai Pan” Owner Donates to Government, Immediately Transported to Beijing
    [This newspaper reports] The ancient Chinese bronze “Guo Ji Zi Bai Pan” has long been identified by textual researchers as an artifact from the time of King Xuan of the Zhou Dynasty. It features extremely exquisite and historically significant large-scale inscriptions. Along with the “Mao Gong Ding” and “San Shi Pan,” it is a rare and important artifact. This artifact originally came from Lang County, Shaanxi, where villagers used it as a trough to water horses. During the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, Xu Xiejun, the magistrate of Yanghu County, discovered it and took it home, making it his private property. In the Jiazi year of the Tongzhi reign, Liu Mingchuan, the Huai Army warlord, attacked the Taiping Army in Changzhou and seized the Pan from Chen Kunshu, the Protector King. He transported it back to Hefei, making it his family's private property and building a pavilion to store it. For over a century, it remained in the Liu family's possession. During the era of the Northern Warlords, Liu Zhenhua attempted to plunder it but failed. Later, war criminals Li Zongren and Li Pinxian also tried to plunder it through coercion and bribery, but were unsuccessful. In August 1949, the former North China Higher Education Committee submitted a request to the former North China People's Government, asking it to issue a document to the Northern Anhui Administrative Office to investigate the whereabouts of the artifact. Subsequently, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Central People's Government and the Northern Anhui Administrative Office corresponded and conducted an investigation. Recently, the artifact has been discovered, and the owner, Liu Suzeng, voluntarily donated it to the People's Government. He also prepared a document, along with another ancient artifact, a bronze drum from the Three Kingdoms period, and sent it to the local People's Government to be forwarded to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government. The government, recognizing his meritorious donation, has provided him with 5,000 jin of rice, hosted a banquet in his honor, and presented him with rubbings as a souvenir. Local people, seeing the artifact restored to the light of day and returned to the people, requested that it be displayed publicly in Hefei for one month. During the exhibition, the daily audience reached over 800 people. The Cultural Relics Bureau plans to transport it to Beijing after the exhibition to be housed in the Palace Museum for long-term viewing by Chinese and foreign visitors and the general public, and for academic research.

    古代珍贵铜器
    “虢季子白盘”藏主捐献政府即运京
    【本报讯】我国古代铜器“虢季子白盘”，历来考证家定为周宣王时物，有极精美且富历史意义的大篇铭文，与“毛公鼎”“散氏盘”等，都是罕有的重器。此器原出陕西廊县，村人用作水槽来饮马。满清道光年间，被阳湖县长徐燮钧发现，运回家去，作了他的私产。同治甲子淮军军阀刘铭传在常州攻打太平军，又从护王陈坤书家掠得此盘，又运回合肥，作了他家的私产，并且筑了一个盘亭来贮藏它。此后一百多年一直藏在刘家。北洋军阀时，曾被刘镇华搜劫未遂；以后战犯李宗仁、李品仙又图劫掠，威逼利诱，均未得到。一九四九年八月曾由前华北高等教育委员会具呈前华北人民政府，请行文皖北行署查明此器的下落。此后中央人民政府文化部文物局与皖北行署函商进行调查，最近此器业经发现，藏主刘肃曾自愿捐献与人民政府，并将此器与另一古器三国时铜鼓一并备文送请当地人民政府请转献中央人民政府毛主席。政府以其捐献有功，已送给大米五千斤，并设宴招待，同时赠予拓本留念。地方人士以此器重见天日，还诸人民，要求留合肥公开展览一个月。展览中每日观众达八百余人。文物局拟于展览后运京入陈故宫博物院，长期供中外人士和广大人民观览，并供学术界研究。
