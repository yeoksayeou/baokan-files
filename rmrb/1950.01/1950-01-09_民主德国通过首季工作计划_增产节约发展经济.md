TASS, Berlin, January 7th: The Central Information Bureau of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic announced: The government has discussed and adopted the work plan for the first quarter of 1950. The government believes that the first priority must be to draft the budget of the German Democratic Republic and formulate laws for developing the economy in 1950. In doing the latter, the experience of implementing the 1949 economic plan should be taken into account. In production, the government intends to pay special attention to improving the quality of goods, saving materials, producing substitutes, utilizing domestic resources, and reducing production costs, among other things. The government instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to submit a report on the preparations for the spring sowing campaign, and to draft decisions on measures to increase yields and further develop animal husbandry in order to reach pre-war levels.
