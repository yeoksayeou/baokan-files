    Heilongjiang Vigorously Prevents Livestock Epidemics This Year
    700,000 Livestock Immunized
    Nearly 30,000 Mange-Affected Horses Cured
    [Report from this newspaper] Northeast News: Heilongjiang Province has attached great importance to livestock epidemic prevention and treatment, and has achieved great results in recent years. After the first Northeast Livestock Conference was held in June last year, the Provincial People's Government promptly dispatched technical cadres to the epidemic areas to carry out epidemic prevention work in a planned and step-by-step manner; from March to October, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties and cities, a total of 731,000 livestock were injected, accounting for about 70% of the province's total number of cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys. These livestock have all obtained an immunity period of one year to one and a half years. Last autumn, the province's statistics showed that there were more than 40,000 mange-affected horses. After treatment with "DDT", nearly 30,000 horses have been cured. This has laid a favorable foundation for this year's spring plowing work and further prevention of livestock epidemics and treatment of horse mange.

    黑龙江年来大力防畜疫
    七十万头牲畜免疫
    治好癞马近三万匹
    【本报讯】东北消息：黑龙江省重视畜疫防治工作，年来获得很大成绩。去年六月东北召开首次畜产会议后，该省人民政府及时派遣技术干部深入畜疫区，有计划、有步骤的进行防疫工作；从三月到十月，据二十九个县市不完全统计，共注射牲畜七十三万一千余头，占全省牛、马、骡、驴总数的百分之七十左右，这些牲畜均获得一年到一年半的免疫期。去年秋季，全省统计有癞马四万余匹，经用“滴滴涕”治疗，已治好近三万匹。为今年的春耕工作以及进一步防畜疫、治马癞打下了有利基础。
