Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th: The Shaanxi Northern Administrative Office convened the Shaanxi Northern Region Production and Construction Conference in Yan'an from December 5th to 15th last year. The conference summarized the agricultural and industrial production of Shaanxi Northern Region in 1949 and formulated the production and construction plan for the Shaanxi Northern Region in 1950. Regarding the production work in 1949, Cui Tianfu, Deputy Director of the Shaanxi Northern Administrative Office, pointed out in his summary: Thanks to the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people throughout the region, great achievements have been made in production in 1949. According to incomplete data: In 1949, the region reclaimed and restored more than 990,000 mu of cultivated land, an increase of more than 6% compared with the cultivated land area in 1948; more than 127,000 mu were planted with cotton, and oil crops increased by more than 17% compared with 1948. The number of livestock increased by about 40,000 head compared with 1948, and the total number of sheep was about 958,000, an increase of more than 30% compared with 1948. The number of cooperatives increased to 210, an increase of 11% compared with 1948. In terms of industry, the production of state-owned factories such as match, soap, papermaking, and agricultural implements, which were restored and established, exceeded the original plan by an average of 16% in 1949, and the quality of the products also improved. After the liberation of Yulin, the three factories taken over have all resumed production long ago. Government agencies and troops have also carried out some sideline production, which has improved their lives. Deputy Director Cui continued: Although Shaanxi Northern Region achieved great success in agricultural and industrial production in 1949, there are still many serious shortcomings in the work: mainly, some leading agencies did not pay enough attention to the inspection of production and the summarization and promotion of typical experiences; some cadres did not fully understand the significance and importance of leading production, and the implementation of agricultural tax and other policies was not thorough enough; the issuance of agricultural loans was not timely and had a tendency to be benevolent relief. In terms of industry: the main shortcomings are the failure to establish an accurate cost accounting system and poor management.
    Regarding the issue of launching a large-scale production campaign in 1950, Deputy Director Cui pointed out: The guiding principle of the Shaanxi Northern Region production and construction plan for 1950 is: in agriculture, we should focus on increasing grain and industrial raw material production, first of all, on the basis of the existing cultivated land area, promote the improvement of farming methods, and try our best to reclaim wasteland and restore the original cultivated land area. In addition, we will focus on developing industry with Yulin's state-owned factories as an important base, developing animal husbandry and rural sideline occupations. Deputy Director Cui finally emphasized: In order to successfully complete the 1950 production and construction plan, all localities must do a good job in various winter preparations: the old areas must strive to complete the assessment of output and the issuance of land certificates before next year's spring plowing, the Huanglong semi-old areas must vigorously complete land reform; the Dingbian and Jingbian recovered areas must complete the work of returning the land property seized from landlords to the peasants; the Yulin new area must continue to deepen the mobilization of the masses, eliminate bandits and special agents, oppose local bullies, and reduce rent.

    陕北行署召集会议订出今年生产建设计划
    农业以增产粮食工业原料为主并尽量作到恢复原有耕地面积
    【新华社西安十四日电】陕北行政公署去年十二月五日至十五日在延安召开陕北区生产建设会议。会议总结了一九四九年陕北农、工业生产，并订出一九五零年陕北区生产建设计划。关于一九四九年的生产工作，陕北行署崔田夫副主任在总结中指出：由于全区党政军民的努力，一九四九年生产已获得很大成绩，据不完全的材料：一九四九年全区共开荒和恢复原有耕地面积九十九万余亩，比一九四八年耕地面积增加了百分之六强；植棉十二万七千余亩，油料作物已比一九四八年增加了百分之十七强。牲畜约比一九四八年发展了四万头，羊子总数约九十五万八千余只，比一九四八年增加了百分之三十强。合作社发展到二百一十处，比一九四八年增加了百分之十一。工业方面：恢复和建立起来的火柴、肥皂、造纸、农具等公营工厂，一九四九年的生产平均超过原订计划的百分之十六，产品的质量也有提高；榆林解放后，接收的三个工厂也都早已恢复生产。机关部队也进行了一些副业生产，改善了生活。崔副主任继称：一九四九年陕北农工业生产虽然获得很大成绩，但在工作中还存在不少严重的缺点：主要是部分领导机关对生产的检查和典型经验的总结与推广不够；部分干部对领导生产的意义与重要性认识不足，贯彻农业税等政策还不够彻底；发放农贷有不及时与曾有恩赐救济的偏向。在工业方面：主要缺点是没有建立精确的成本核算制度和管理不善。
    关于开展一九五○年的大生产运动问题，崔副主任指出：一九五○年陕北生产建设计划的方针是：在农业方面，应以增产粮食和工业原料为主，首先在现有耕地面积基础上，提倡改良农作法，并尽可能作到开垦荒地与恢复原有的耕地面积。此外，以榆林的公营工厂为重要发展工业，发展牧畜业和农村副业等。崔副主任最后强调指出：为顺利完成一九五○年的生产建设计划，各地必须做好各项冬季的准备工作：老区必须全力争取于明年春耕前全部完成评定产量与发放土地证工作，黄龙半老区必须大力完成土地改革；定边、靖边收复区完成将地主倒算的土地财产归还农民的工作；榆林新区必须继续深入进行发动群众，肃清土匪特务，反对恶霸以及减租。
