Part of the Southern-Transported Cultural Relics of the Palace Museum Returned to the Capital
Beijing Library Transported a Large Number of Books Back from Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] With the exception of a portion looted by the Kuomintang remnants and taken to Taiwan, 1,500 boxes of cultural relics from the Palace Museum that were transported south during the Chinese War of Resistance have now been returned to the capital. In 1933, when Japanese寇 (Kou - a derogatory term for the Japanese invaders) advanced on the Great Wall, the Palace Museum's cultural relics were transported south, then from Nanjing to Leshan, Emei, and Anshun in Guizhou Province, Sichuan. In 1945, they were concentrated in Chongqing and transported back to Nanjing. After the liberation of Nanjing in 1949, the remaining cultural relics were inventoried. Excluding the 2,972 boxes of selected fine pieces looted by the Kuomintang government and taken to Taiwan, a total of 11,178 boxes remained. According to the instructions of the East China District Guidance and Reception Work Group of the Government Administration Council in December last year, a total of 1,500 boxes (including 1,283 boxes of cultural relics and 217 boxes of equipment) of antiquities, books, archives, and equipment needed for display for the development of social education, were transported to Beijing first, under the unified planning of the Transportation Committee. They were loaded onto trains in Nanjing on the 24th of this month and arrived in Beijing at 1:00 PM on the 26th. The employees of the Palace Museum received and transported them in groups according to the predetermined procedure, and all were returned to the Palace Museum by 4:00 PM on the 27th.

[Another Report] The books and instruments of the Shanghai Office of the Beijing Library were transported from Shanghai to Beijing on the 26th. These include 25 boxes of rare Chinese books, 49 boxes of Dunhuang manuscripts, two boxes of microphotographic book machines, and 45 boxes of international exchange books from the Shanghai Office of the Central Library. In addition, there are 13 boxes of valuable books from the Huo family's Tieqin Gangjian House in Shanghai, and 6 boxes of cultural relics and images of the Prince of Yang of the Ming Dynasty donated by Zhu Qiling. There are also 81 boxes of engineering books transported back from Nanjing, totaling 334 pieces of books of various sizes, which have been transported to the Beijing Library.
