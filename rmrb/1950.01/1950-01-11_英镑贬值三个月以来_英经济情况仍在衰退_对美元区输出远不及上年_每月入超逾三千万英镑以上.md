Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Recent figures show that the British economic situation has remained in a state of recession for the three months since the devaluation of the pound. Gold and dollar reserves have still failed to reach the so-called minimum safe point of $2 billion. According to a United Press report: The British Treasury announced on the 4th that for the last quarter of 1949, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were $1.6888 billion (calculated at the old exchange rate of $4.03 per pound, totaling £416 million).

TASS reported on the decline of British reserves, stating: At the end of 1945, British reserves were $2.476 billion; in March 1948, before "US aid" began, they were $2.241 billion; and at the end of September 1949, they had fallen to $1.425 billion. The sharp drop in reserves was caused by the impact of the "Marshall Plan."

British trade with the dollar area (the United States and Canada) in October and November still could not reach the figures for the first quarter of last year. Exports to the US in October were $15.68 million and in November $20.44 million; exports to Canada in October were $17.52 million and in November $21 million. The average monthly exports to the US in the first quarter of last year were $22.2 million, and to Canada $26.7 million. British government trade advisor Brown admitted in a speech in New York on December 27th that British exports to the US had decreased by 10% compared to the previous year.

In addition to the shrinking trade with the dollar area, the Labor government still faces the difficulty of a huge import surplus. According to official figures released by the British Information Services, the average monthly import surplus in the third quarter of last year reached £42.22 million, more than double the average of £21 million in the first quarter of last year. The revised figure for the October import surplus was £37.6 million, and for November, £34.7 million. Agence France-Presse reported that as early as October last year, London financial circles estimated that the value of imported goods had risen by 20% due to the devaluation of the pound, and the effect of devaluation on stimulating exports had completely disappeared.

    英镑贬值三个月以来
    英经济情况仍在衰退
    对美元区输出远不及上年  每月入超逾三千万英镑以上
    【新华社北京十日电】最近各种数字显示，英镑贬值三个月来的英国经济情况，依然陷于衰退的状态中。黄金美元准备仍未能达到二十亿美元的所谓最低安全点。据合众社讯：英财政部四日宣布一九四九年最后一季，英国黄金美元准备于十六亿八千八百万美元（按旧汇率四点零三美元，合一英镑计算，共合四亿一千六百万镑。）
    塔斯社报道英国准备金下降的情形称：在一九四五年末，英国准备金为二十四亿七千六百万美元，一九四八年三月，即在“美援”开始之前，为二十二亿四千一百万美元，而在一九四九年九月末，则下降到十四亿二千五百万美元。准备金的剧跌是由“马歇尔计划”的冲击所造成的。
    英国在十、十一两月对美元区（美国和加拿大）的贸易依然不能达到去年第一季的数字。去年十月份对美输出为一千五百六十八万美元，十一月份为二千零四十四万美元；对加输出十月份为一千七百五十二万美元，十一月份为二千一百万美元。而去年第一季对美输出每月平均额为二千二百二十万美元，对加输出为二千六百七十万美元。英政府贸易顾问布朗德于去年十二月二十七日在纽约的谈话中，承认英国对美出口，已较前年减少了百分之十。
    除了对美元区贸易的萎缩外，工党政府仍面临巨额入超的困难。据英国新闻处发表的官方数字，去年第三季每月平均入超高达四千二百二十万镑，超过去年第一季平均数二千一百万镑一倍以上。十月份入超修正数字为三千七百六十万镑，十一月份入超为三千四百七十万镑。法新社讯，早在去年十月间，伦敦金融界人士即估计入口货价值已因英镑贬值而上升了百分之二十，贬值对于刺激出口的作用已全部消失。
