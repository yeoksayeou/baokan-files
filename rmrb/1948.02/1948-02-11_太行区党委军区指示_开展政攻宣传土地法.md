    Taihang District Party Committee and Military Region Instruction
    Launch Political Offensive to Publicize the Land Law
    [Taihang News] The Taihang District Party Committee and the Political Department of the Taihang Military Region jointly issued instructions last month to vigorously launch a comprehensive political offensive centered on publicizing the Outline Land Law. The instructions stated: "We must concentrate all the strength of the Party, government, army, and people in the border areas, penetrate deep into the enemy's heart, and launch a full-scale political offensive against the enemy to coordinate with the victorious operations of the southward counter-offensive army, to coordinate with the thorough realization of the Outline Land Law, and to more broadly develop guerrilla warfare in the border areas, in order to accelerate the collapse of the Chiang bandits. In the course of extensive propaganda, the current main task is to explain the Outline Land Law in detail, and to tell all personnel forced to participate in the Chiang side's work and their broad masses of soldiers that as long as they return quickly (within the time limit), they can equally share a portion of land and property, and can be sent home (those who voluntarily join the People's Liberation Army are even more welcome)." The instructions also stated: "In launching the political offensive, we must pay special attention to propaganda among the broad lower strata of local tyrants and puppet organizations, because they have a certain social foundation and are the claws of the Chiang army's regular troops, but we also have the confidence and conditions to strive to disintegrate them. Only by doing so can we more easily develop guerrilla warfare and carry out the equal distribution movement." In terms of methods, the instructions emphasized: "We must hand over the weapon of this political offensive to the broad masses, so that everyone can think of ways and offer ideas, and universally launch a mass 'shouting for husband' and 'saving lives' competition movement, and combine land reform with the organization of poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations to carry out heart-winning warfare in an organized manner. Resolutely overcome the phenomenon of contradiction between this work and local mass movements in the past." The instructions concluded: "All localities must seize the time before and after the old lunar New Year to quickly carry out the work, establish the idea of accumulating small victories into great victories, overcome the idea of eating big fish, and strive for one person and one gun, which is all good."

    太行区党委军区指示
    开展政攻宣传土地法
    【太行消息】太行区党委和太行军区政治部，在上月联合发出大力开展以宣传土地法大纲为中心的全面政治攻势指示。该指示说：“我们必须集中边地党政军民一切力量，深入到敌人心脏中去，全力开展对敌政治攻势，来配合南下反攻大军的胜利作战，配合土地法大纲的彻底实现，和更广泛的开展边地游击战争，以加速蒋匪崩溃过程。在广泛进行宣传中，目前主要是深入详细解释土地法大纲，并告诉一切被迫参加蒋方工作的人员及其广大士兵群众，只要赶快（限期）回来，就可以平分到一份土地财产，并可遣送回家（自愿参加解放军者更欢迎）。”该指示又说：“开展政治攻势中，我们要特别注意对土顽伪广大下层进行宣传，因为它有一定的社会基础，又是蒋军正规部队的爪牙，但我们也有信心有条件来争取瓦解他们。同时也只有这样作，才能更便利我们开展游击战争与进行平分运动。”在作法上，该指示着重说：“要把这一政治攻势的斗争武器交给广大群众，大家想办法、出主意，普遍开展一个群众性的‘叫子索夫’和‘救命’竞赛运动，并结合土改分田组织贫农团、农会，有组织的进行攻心战。坚决克服过去这一工作和地方群运矛盾的现象。”指示最后说：“各地要抓紧旧历年关前后，迅速进行，树立积小胜为大胜的思想，克服吃大鱼思想，争取一人一枪都是好的。”
