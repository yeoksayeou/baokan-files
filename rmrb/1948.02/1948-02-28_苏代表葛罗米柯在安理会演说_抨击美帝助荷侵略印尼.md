Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 26th: According to TASS, New York, the Security Council reconvened on the 19th to discuss the report of the Three-Nation Mediation Committee on the situation in Indonesia. Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a lengthy speech, vehemently criticizing the US imperialist conspiracy to assist Dutch aggression. Gromyko first stated that the Soviet and Ukrainian representatives had urged the Security Council as early as the beginning of 1946 to pay attention to the war launched by Britain and the Netherlands to stifle the Indonesian national liberation movement. The Soviet representative at that time suggested that the troops of both sides withdraw to the positions before the outbreak of the Dutch-Indonesian War. However, the Soviet proposal was resolutely opposed by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and China (Chiang). As a result, the Dutch aggression in Indonesia was further intensified. The Security Council subsequently neither adopted another Soviet proposal to establish a Security Council Ceasefire Agreement Implementation Committee, nor took any effective and minimal decisions to oppose Dutch aggression. Gromyko continued, stating that the so-called Three-Nation (US, Australia, Belgium) Mediation Committee was, in fact, not a representative body of the Security Council; the committee's activities had consistently ignored the Security Council and were only directed by the governments of the United States, Belgium, and Australia. Gromyko further pointed out that the Netherlands blatantly violated the Security Council's decisions, especially in Madura and Java, where it carried out massacres of peaceful Indonesian residents. The Dutch authorities knew that their atrocities could go unpunished, and the Netherlands used this situation to seize all the most important areas of the Republic of Indonesia. The Dutch-Indonesian "Renville" Truce Agreement completely conformed to Dutch interests, and the demarcation of the Van Mook Line meant that the Netherlands gained control over the oil and rubber-rich areas of Java and Sumatra. Only a small part of central Java and the inland mountainous areas of Sumatra were left to the Republic of Indonesia. The Dutch plan to establish the "United States of Indonesia" has seriously damaged the interests and sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. Gromyko emphasized that the committee's approval of the agreement was an act of betrayal of the Indonesian people. When Gromyko criticized the reason why the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and other countries colluded with the Dutch aggressors, he emphasized that US imperialism had significant economic interests in Indonesia and had imported large amounts of oil, lead, rubber, and other important resources from Indonesia. Gromyko stated that it was not surprising that influential people in the United States sympathized with the Netherlands and not with the Indonesian people. In fact, the US representative in the Security Council, when dealing with the fate of the Indonesian people, consistently and viciously intensified the oppression and exploitation of the Indonesian people and suppressed the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement. Gromyko finally reiterated the Soviet proposal to require the troops of both Indonesia and the Netherlands to withdraw to the positions before the outbreak of the war.

　　苏代表葛罗米柯在安理会演说
  　抨击美帝助荷侵略印尼
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：安理会十九日复会讨论三国调停委员会关于印尼局势的报告。苏联代表葛罗米柯发表长篇演说，猛烈评击美帝助荷侵略之阴谋。葛氏首称：苏联与乌克兰代表远在一九四六年初便敦促安理会注意英、荷为窒息印尼民族解放运动而发动的战事，苏联代表当时建议双方军队撤至印荷战争爆发前的位置；但苏联的建议遭到美、英、法、比和中国（蒋）的坚决反对；结果荷兰在印尼的侵略行动进一步加紧。安理会此后既未采取苏联提出的成立安理会停战协定实施委员会的另一建议，亦未采取任何有效与最低限度的决定，以反对荷兰的侵略。葛罗米柯继称：所谓三国（美、澳、比）调停委员会，事实上不是安理会的代表机构；调委会的活动，一直都不理睬安理会，只受美、比、澳政府所指挥。葛氏进一步指出：荷兰横蛮地违犯安理会的决定，特别是在马都拉、爪哇大肆屠杀印尼和平居民。荷兰当局知道，他们的暴行可以不受惩办，荷兰并利用这一情势攫取印尼共和国一切最重要地区。印荷“伦维尔”停战协定，完全符合于荷兰利益，划定范·穆克分界线，意味着荷兰取得对爪哇及苏门答腊石油与橡胶富藏地区的控制。只有爪哇中部一小部与苏岛内陆山区留给了印尼共和国。荷兰建立“印尼合众国”的计划，已严重地损害着印尼共和国的利益和主权。葛氏强调称：调委会批准该协定，是一种对印尼人民的出卖行为。葛罗米柯抨击美、英、法、比和其他国家勾结荷兰侵略者之原因时，着重指出：美帝国主义对印尼有重大的经济利益，并已自印尼输入大量的石油、铅、树胶和其他重要资源。葛氏称：美国有势力人士同情荷兰而不同情印尼人民，这并不奇怪，事实上，美国在安理会的代表处理印尼人民命运时，一贯为穷凶极恶地加紧对印尼人民的压迫剥削，而镇压印尼人民的独立解放运动。葛罗米柯最后重申苏联要求印荷双方军队撤至战争爆发前的位置之提案。
