Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th—(1) In order to open up the Tai'an-Laiwu and Tai'an-Licheng highways, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits massed two regiments of the 77th Brigade of the 73rd Division stationed in Tai'an, two battalions of the 187th Brigade stationed in Laiwu, the 112th Brigade stationed in Licheng, the 213th Brigade stationed in Liubo, and puppet miscellaneous troops, under the command of Cao Zhenduo, commander of the bandit 73rd Division. Starting from the 10th of last month, they advanced towards Dawangzhuang (40 li west of Laicheng) in separate directions. On the 17th, when the bandit 77th Brigade attacked Yangqiu Mountain, they were intercepted by one of our units, and more than 200 bandits, including a battalion commander, were annihilated. The next day, bandit Cao hurriedly fled back to Tai'an with his command headquarters. The 112th Brigade headquarters and one regiment shrunk back to strongholds such as Liubu and Zhonggong, only 50 li away from Jinan. (2) The people's armed forces of Boshan, Zhangqiu, and Licheng counties cooperated with the anti-"mopping-up" operations in the Tai'an, Laiwu, and Licheng border areas, annihilating more than 200 enemies and seizing more than 50 rifles from the 11th to the 16th of last month.
