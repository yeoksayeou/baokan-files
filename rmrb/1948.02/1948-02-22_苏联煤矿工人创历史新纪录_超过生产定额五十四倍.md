　　Soviet Coal Miners Set Historic Record
    Exceeding Production Quota by Fifty-Four Times
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 20th: Moscow dispatch: Shalnekov, a coal miner in the Donets Basin and a deputy to the Soviet of the Stalino Oblast, created an astonishing new record on the 16th by mining 513 tons of coal in seven hours using an air-powered coal digging machine, exceeding the production quota by more than 54 times. Since the beginning of this year, Donets miners have broken and created new coal mining records ten times, marking an unprecedented surge in production competition in the region. On February 13th alone, Tolonkov, a worker at the Kalinin Coal Trust in Gorlovka, set a historic new record of mining 426 tons of coal in seven hours, breaking his own previous record of 211 tons of coal set two weeks earlier, but within three days, his fellow miner Shalnekov broke his new record again. This fiercely competitive movement has been widely reported in the Soviet newspapers and is considered a prelude to the great achievements of the third year of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan. Other Soviet industries are also currently launching production competitions with all their might to welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, which will arrive on February 23rd.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 20th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet coal mines, which had the highest degree of mechanization in the world before the war, are adding new machinery and equipment every day. By the end of last year, 96 percent of the coal mining process and 90 percent of the loading process were done by machines, and this year 98 percent of coal mining and 100 percent of loading will be done by machines. The mechanization of production has greatly increased worker productivity. For example, the average output of a coal mining machine in a certain coal mine in Donbas was 10,300 tons in December last year, but now, Stakhanovite workers have increased it to 14,000 to 15,000 tons. Soviet factories have begun to manufacture coal mining and loading machines in large quantities for the complete mechanization of the coal mining process. This is a masterpiece of Soviet engineers, which can automatically excavate and transport coal to the conveyor belt. Last year, Donbas coal miners also designed new air drilling machines and powerful loading machines. The Soviet industry has begun to manufacture new electric locomotives and conveyor belts. The production of coal mining equipment last year exceeded 50 percent of the pre-war level, and it will increase even more this year.

　　苏联煤矿工人创历史新纪录
    超过生产定额五十四倍
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：顿尼兹煤矿工人斯大林诺州苏维埃代表沙尔涅可夫，十六日以空气挖煤机创造七小时挖煤五百一十三吨之惊人新纪录，超过生产定额五十四倍以上。自今年年初以来，顿尼兹矿工已十次打破并创造挖煤新纪录，标志着该区生产竞赛已达空前热潮。仅在本月十三日，哥尔洛夫卡加里宁煤矿托辣斯工人托伦科夫，创造了七小时挖煤四百二十六吨的历史新纪录，打破了他自己在两星期前创造的挖煤二百一十一吨的旧纪录，但不出三天，同矿工人沙尔涅可夫就又打破了他的新纪录。这一如火如荼的竞赛运动已为全苏报纸以巨大篇幅竞先刊载，被认为是苏联战后五年计划第三年伟大成就的先声。苏联其他各工业最近亦正以全力展开生产竞赛，迎接将于本月二十三日到来的红军建军三十周年纪念日。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：战前机械化程度即占世界第一位的苏联煤矿，每天都在加装新的机器设备。截至去年底，挖煤过程百分之九十六，装车百分之九十是用机器的，而今年采煤百分之九十八，装车百分之百都要用机器。生产机械化已使工人生产率大为增加，如顿巴斯某一煤矿挖煤机的平均产量，去年十二月份为一万零三百吨，而现在，斯塔哈诺夫运动者已把它提高到一万四千吨至一万五千吨。苏联工厂已为煤矿生产过程全部机械化开始大批制造挖煤装车两用机。这是苏联工程师的精心杰作，可以自动挖掘并装运煤斤至输送带上，顿巴斯煤矿工人去年还设计了新式的空气钻空机与强大的装运机。苏联工业已开始制造新式电力车头与输送带，去年采煤设备的生产已超过战前百分之五十，今年将更增加。
