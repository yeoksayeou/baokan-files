Many Landlords Eat, Drink, and Live Lavishly; Cadres Cover Up Those Who Haven't Been Struggled Against

What is the situation of the landlords? Until now, most landlords still live better than the peasants. Because in the past, except for the properties of the escaped landlords which were completely confiscated, other landlords retained a portion of land of good quality, and it was only exchanged after the autumn harvest last year. In this way, the grain harvested by the landlords in the autumn remained untouched. This was the fault of the former political director Duan Bingnan, the farmers' association director Duan Laiyou, and other village cadres. When exchanging the land, they advocated letting the landlords harvest the autumn grain before the exchange, and then struggling against them after the exchange. But afterwards, there was no struggle, allowing most landlords and rich peasants to eat, drink, and live lavishly. From the 17th to the 19th of the old lunar November, the landlord Zhang Wei bought cigarettes from the cooperative four times. Zhang Shumei, Zhang Shutian, and Zhang Laoxian often bought noodles, green sauce, and fermented bean curd from the cooperative. Moreover, judging from the cooperative's accounts, landlords could buy things on credit, but poor people couldn't. Poor peasant Duan Guangyun said: "We are afraid of not being able to get credit, so we dare not even ask about it."

Some old rich men are shielded by cadres and have not been struggled against. Take Zhang Liang as an example. In the past, he had more than 20 mu of land of his own, and rented more than 50 mu from Chang Shan's mother's family, raised mules, and hired laborers. During the land reform, he only contributed a little land, and none of the floating wealth was touched. Now he is still the manager of the cooperative's steamed bun shop. Once he gets involved in this business, he doesn't allow anyone else to open a steamed bun shop. If you want to sell steamed buns, you can only buy them from him, and you are not allowed to buy them from other villages. The masses believe that the cooperative manager, Zhang Wenbin, is a feudal rich peasant and was still given dividends.

    不少地主大吃二喝
    干部包庇的还没斗
    地主的情况怎么样呢？直到现在，大部分的地主，还比农民的生活好。因为过去除了逃亡地主的家产全部没收以外，其他地主都留下一部分质量好的土地，到去年秋收以后才换了换。这样，地主秋季收的粮食就没有动。这是前任政治主任段炳南、农会主任段来友等村干部捣的鬼。换地的时候，他们主张让地主收了秋粮再换，换罢再斗。可是以后就没有斗，使大部分地主富农还大吃二喝。从旧历十一月十七到十九日，地主张炜到合作社买了四回纸烟。张树梅、张树田、张老宪常到合作社买挂面、青酱、豆腐乳等。而且从合作社的帐上来看，地主能赊东西，穷人就办不到。贫农段光云说：“咱就怕赊不出来，才不敢张嘴说赊东西。”
    有的老财，叫干部包庇起来，没有斗。象张亮，过去自己有二十多亩地，又租了长善娘家五十多亩，喂着骡子，雇着长工。土地改革当中，只献了点地，浮财一点没动。现在还当着合作社馍馍坊的经理。他一搞这个买卖，就再也不准别人开馍馍坊，要是贩卖馍馍，也只能到他那里去贩，不准到外村去贩。合作社经理张文斌，群众认为他是封建富农，还分了果实。
