　　Yuanshi Seventh District: Some District Cadres "Rushed" to Carelessly Establish Poor Peasant Leagues
    [This newspaper's report] A message published in the Yuanshi Peasant Life Gazette states: After the announcement of the Land Law, some district cadres in Yuanshi's seventh district organized poor peasant leagues even before the county leadership called for it. Preliminary investigations reveal that these poor peasant leagues are fake. Comrade Zhi Erping, together with Mei Lü Village, copied a list of names from the village roster, called them together according to the list, announced it, and then declared the poor peasant league established. Many people became members of the poor peasant league in a confused manner. Of the four cadres in the Xijian Poor Peasant League, three are family members of puppet soldiers. These district cadres are trying to catch up with the "trend" and "show off," rather than genuinely mobilizing the poor and hired peasants. Because they were not developed through proper poor and hired peasant review, the organizational composition is also very impure. Bad people have seized leadership, and genuine, upright, and honest poor and hired peasants still dare not speak. Most of these poor peasant leagues are fake and cannot serve the poor and hired peasants.

　　元氏七区：有些区干“抢先”马虎成立贫雇团
    【本报消息】元氏农民生活小报上发表消息说：元氏七区有的区干部在土地法宣布后，县里领导上还没有叫成立贫农团，他们已经组织开了。据初步了解，这些贫农团都是假的。智二平同志在同梅吕村按村里造的花名册抄下单，按单叫到一块宣布了一下，就宣告贫农团成立了，好多群众糊里糊涂的便成了贫农团员。西尖贫农团中的四个干部，三个是伪军家属。这些区干部是为了赶“时兴”“出风头”，不是认真发动贫雇。因不是经过正派贫雇审查发展的，组织成份也很不纯，坏人掌握了领导权，真正的正派老实贫雇仍然不敢说话，这些贫雇团大部是假的，是不能替贫雇办事的。
