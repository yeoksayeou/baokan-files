    Middle Peasants Understand the Land Law, Production Immediately Picks Up
    [Left Right News] Most of the village cadres in Wangjiadian Village, District 7, are illiterate. When the Land Law was transmitted to the village, they didn't understand it clearly, so they couldn't publicize it well. Two situations arose in the village: The hired and poor peasants, who had overturned their situation more thoroughly last year, took an indifferent attitude towards the Land Law, thinking, "We don't care about whether it's redistributed or not." The wealthy middle peasants were afraid. For example, Chen Laixiu said: "Last year, the landlord Zhang Renzi said to me: 'Struggle is like cutting leeks, this year it's me, next year it will be you.' Now, hearing about another equal distribution, I myself am scared. I don't want to plan anything, I'm just afraid that my donkey will be divided. I'd be happy to give up the land, but I can't figure out the donkey." The village chief is a new middle peasant, with some surplus grain, and is afraid that the masses will divide it, but he's afraid in his heart and doesn't dare to say it, fearing that the masses will report him. On the 18th of this month, hired and poor peasant cadres went to the district to discuss the Land Law. They studied in the district for two days before they finally understood it. When they returned to the village, they first publicized and discussed it with the hired and poor peasants. During the discussion, cadre Shi Yuzhu said: "I received an extra sheep last year, and I will give it back to the masses during the equal distribution." Two or three other cadres also talked like this. At the middle peasant meeting, the supplementary measures of the Border Region Government were discussed: The surplus property of wealthy middle peasants will not be touched, and land exceeding the limit will be voluntarily given up. And once they understood what surplus property was (livestock, grain, farm tools, etc.), the middle peasants were relieved. Laixiu said: "Now I can rest assured. The struggle is not like cutting leeks, my things are still mine. What am I afraid of? From now on, I must work hard." Since understanding the Outline, sixty-year-old Chen Laixiu has been carrying charcoal to the city, eighty catties per load, attending every market day. He said, "When people are happy, they are energetic."

    中农弄清土地法  生产立时起了劲
    【左权消息】七区王家店村干部大部不识字，土地法传达到村，他们就没有闹清楚，宣传也就宣传不好。在村里产生了两种情况：去年翻身较彻底的雇贫，对土地法是不理态度，分不分咱不管。富裕中农害怕，如陈来秀说：“去年地主张任子和我说：斗争好比割韭菜，今年是我，明年就是你。现在听到又平分呀，我自己就害了怕。我是啥也不结计，就是怕分了我的驴。地往出拿我还高兴哩，驴就啥时也想不通。”村长是个新中农，粮食有些富裕，害怕群众分了，但心害怕，嘴上不敢说，怕群众反映。在本月十八日雇贫干部到区讨论土地法，在区里学习了两天，才算闹通。回村就先给雇贫宣传讨论。在讨论时干部史玉珠说：我去年多分了一只羊，到平分时我要给群众拿出来。又有两三个干部也是这样谈。在中农会议上讨论边府的补充办法：富裕中农浮财不动，地多余了自愿往出拿。并且知道了啥是浮财（牲口、粮食、农具等），中农这才放了心。来秀说：“这我可算放下心了，斗争不是割韭菜，咱的东西还是咱哩。咱还怕啥？往后可要好好受哩。”自从清楚了大纲后，六十岁的老汉陈来秀往城担木炭，一担八十斤，每集都到，他说：“人高兴了精神也就壮了。”
