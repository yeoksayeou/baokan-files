【Taihang News】 Fu Yutang and Zhao Jin, cadres from the district, and Ren Yuexian, a cadre from the county in Shexian County, discovered in their recent in-depth visits to poor peasants and hired laborers to hear their grievances, that they are still suffering from the landlords' cruel exploitation through rent. In Zhao Yu Village, due to the landlords and rich peasants holding power, they have been suppressing the peasants. The village chief, Fu Liangzhu, is an old rich peasant (who still hires long-term laborers), the political director, Fu Linlu, is a well-to-do middle peasant (who was even allocated 2.8 mu of good land in the winter of 1946); the deputy political director, Fu De, is a rich peasant; the director of the militia committee, Fu Jintian, is a bankrupt landlord; and the cooperative accountant, Fu Yuting, is a landlord (poor people are still pawning their land to him; he has not only never been struggled against but was even allocated a large poplar tree). The poor peasant Liu Chuncheng complained: "I am still pawning four mu of land from Liu Fushuo (a rich peasant) and renting five dilapidated houses from Wang Cunde (a landlord), paying five dou of rent grain each year, for a total of 35 years. I was just emancipated in the winter of the year before last (1946). I proposed to the farmers' association that I wanted to sever these pawned lands and rented houses, but the political director got angry and said that Wang Cunde was not a rich peasant, 'There are no landlords in our village.' The cadres are protecting them, and nothing was touched. And that's not all, the cadres insisted that I redeem the land pawned to Liu Fushuo, but the district cadres didn't allow it in the end. Last winter (1946), I still paid five dou of rent grain for the houses rented from the finance director. Look at Wang Haoxian and eight other landlord and rich peasant families, they are still raising more than 150 sheep. Zhao Sanlou (a landlord) even used 150,000 yuan to buy a donkey. Now the Land Law says that feudalism will be completely abolished, and I am very happy, and just hope I can truly be emancipated this time!" The main problem in Ganquan Village is also that some cadres are protecting landlords and rich peasants. To this day, four poor peasant households – Ning Yunqing, Ning Shuangting, Ning Shuiting, and Ning Laoer – are still renting more than six mu of good land from the rich peasant Ning Shichang, paying one old dou (40 jin) of wheat per mu in May and three old dou (120 jin) of millet per mu in autumn. Last year (1947), the harvest was poor, with only 70% yield on two mu of land, and they still paid 1.6 dou of rent wheat. The remaining land yielded nothing, and they didn't pay any rent. After the Land Law was promulgated, on the seventh day of the twelfth lunar month this year, the mother of the landlord Ning Shichang even went to the poor peasant Ning Shuiting's house to demand rent, saying that not a single grain could be spared. She even stayed overnight in Shuiting's house and urinated on the kang, bullying them to the extreme. The next day, Shuiting complained to the cadres, who still adopted persuasive methods, "mobilizing" Shichang's mother to go back, but to no avail. In the end, she was forcibly dragged out. Only now has she been placed under control.

    涉县赵峪、甘泉两村
    地主至今还收重租
    【太行消息】涉县赵峪、甘泉两村，区上干部傅玉堂、赵锦和县里干部任月先在最近深入贫雇访苦中，发现他们至今还受着地主残酷的租佃剥削。赵峪由于地主富农掌权，一直压制农民。该村村长傅良柱是老富农（现在还雇着长工），政治主任傅林禄是富裕中农（四六年冬还分了二亩八分好地）；副政治主任傅德是富农；武委会主任傅锦天是破落地主；合作社会计傅玉廷是地主（至今穷人还典他的地，以前不但没挨过斗，反分了个大杨树），贫农刘春成诉苦说：“现在我还是典的人家刘富所（富农）四亩地，租的财政主任王存德（地主）五间破房子，每年出五斗租谷，一共租了卅五年啦。前年（四六年）冬天刚翻身，我在农会提出要割了这些典地租房，政治主任发了火，说王存德不是富农，“咱村就没地主”。干部包庇，人家一点东西也没动。这还不算，干部非叫我把典的刘富所的地给赎回去不可，后来还是区干部没让。租的财政主任家房子，去冬（四六年）还是给人家出了五斗租谷。再看人家王好先等八家地主富农，还喂着一百五十多只羊，赵三楼（地主）还用十五万块钱买了头驴。这回土地法说要把封建一律取消，我很高兴，就看这回可真能翻身了吧？！”甘泉村主要也是有些干部包庇地主富农。至今宁云青、宁双庭、宁水庭、宁老二等四户贫农，还租着富农宁石昌六亩多好地，每亩地五月出租麦一老斗（四十斤），秋天出租米三老斗（一百二十斤）。去年（四七年）收成不好，只有二亩地收七成，还交租麦一斗六升，其余地一籽没见，也没交租。土地法公布后，在今年阴历腊月初七，地主宁石昌的母亲，竟然还到贫农宁水庭家逼要租子，说一粒也不能少，晚上并住在水庭家，又往炕上屙尿，欺侮至极。第二天，水庭找着干部诉苦，干部还采取说服办法，“动员”石昌的母亲回去，结果无效，最后还是硬拉出去。现在才算是管制起来啦。
