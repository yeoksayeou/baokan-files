    Is Li Yuming a Working Cadre?
    The District Should Be Responsible for Investigating Clearly
    To the Editor:
    During our investigation of loan conditions in Qianbailin Village, we heard from villagers Li Jufu, Liu Richang, Zhu Shichang, Liu Engong, and others about the following matter:
    Li Yuming, who was originally the director of the police station in Yangyi, is from Qianbailin Village. He was transferred south this time but returned midway. After arriving home, he packed up his tools, shouldered his carrying pole, and went out. The villagers and village cadres suspect that he is no longer working. The village cadres asked the district, but the district said they couldn't figure it out, but he still had to be treated as a worker's family member. Once, the village assigned him a task, but his wife refused to do it. Li Yuming wrote a letter to the village chief saying, "I'm still a cadre, why don't you care?" This time when we arrived in Bailin, the villagers and village cadres were asking us, "Is Li Yuming still working?"
    On the 27th, he came back and tried to sound us out. When we asked him, he said he was "demobilized," and then said he was doing "secret work." When asked about his leadership relations, he said "in the county," and then said "the county can't control it either," etc., he was very evasive.
    Why are the masses inquiring about his background like this? The masses believe that he has abandoned his work, and at the same time, he has done many things that have let down the masses, for example: 1. He used to be very poor, but after becoming a cadre after the Anti-Japanese War, he became rich. Now he has mules at home; his house is bright (meaning good lacquered furniture, plastered walls), he eats well, raises sheep, has shepherds, and has farmhands. 2. He forcibly occupied the water cellar of the big landlord Liu Dezhi that the masses had confiscated. In Bailin, water is very scarce in the spring. He sealed his own water cellar and used other people's water. After using it up, he wouldn't let the masses use his water. If anyone went, he would kick the water bucket and scold them, still refusing to let them use it. ...
    We believe that such a person, if he is a cadre, should also be educated by the department to which he belongs and let the masses deal with it. If he is not a cadre but pretends to be one, he should be brought to justice. Because the masses cannot figure it out, we are specially reporting it on their behalf, and ask the newspaper to answer this question for the masses. (Wang Peizhang)
    Editor's Note: District cadres should not say "can't figure it out" and push it away. The district should be responsible for clarifying this matter and handling it in accordance with government regulations.

    李玉明是不是工作干部
    区上应该负责查个明白
    编辑同志：
    我们在前柏林村调查贷款情形时，据该村群众李聚富、刘日常、朱世昌、刘恩功等说，有这么一件事：
    原来在阳邑当公安局派出所长的李玉明，是前柏林人，这次调他南下，中途回来了。到家后，收拾起张罗的工具，挑起担子就出外了。群众和村干部怀疑他已不做工作了，村干问区里，区里也说弄不清，但还得按工属待遇。一次村中派了他的差，他老婆不出，李玉明给村长写信说：“老子还是干部，你为什么不管？”这次我们到了柏林，群众村干在问我们：“李玉明是否还做工作？”
    在二十七日，他回来了，找到我们那里探口气；我们问他，他说“复员了”，又说作“秘密工作”。问他领导关系，他说“在县里”，又说“县里也管不着”等等，支支吾吾的。
    为什么群众这样打听他的根由呢？群众认为他是脱离了工作，同时他有不少对不住群众的事，举例如：一、他原来很穷，抗战后当了干部就富起来了，现在家里喂着骡子；家中明光光的（意思是好漆家具、棚粉的房子），吃的好，喂着羊，有放羊的，有长工。二、群众没收大地主刘得志的水窖他强占为己有了；柏林春天水很缺，他封住自己的水窖吃人家的，吃光后不让群众吃他的水，有人去就踢了水桶大骂一顿，还是不让吃。………
    我们认为，象这样的人，如是干部，亦应由所属部门进行教育，并让群众来处理。如不是干部而冒充干部，更应法办。因群众无法弄清，特为代达，请报社给群众解答这一问题。（王裴璋）
    编者按：区干部不应该说“弄不清”就推开不管，这件事区里应负责把它弄明白；按照政府条例办理。
