Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: Rome dispatch: The Italian People's Democratic Front movement is unfolding a magnificent array throughout the country. According to figures announced by the Front's organizing committee, dozens of political parties and mass organizations have joined the People's Democratic Front. In January alone, the Front held meetings in dozens of locations across Italy and established a fund committee. People's Front branch offices have been established in many central areas, including Milan, Turin, Brescia, Bolzano, Genoa, @拉拉 in northern Italy; Rome, Florence, Perugia, Pisa, Ancona in central Italy; and Bari in southern Italy. The National Labor Youth Conference, scheduled to convene in Genoa on the 8th of this month, is being actively prepared. A new movement called "Garibaldi's Vanguard" has been launched among young people in central and southern Italy, uniting them in the struggle for fundamental social reforms. "Garibaldi's Vanguard" has already held youth conferences in nineteen cities, including Rome, and elected delegates to attend the National Youth Conference. "Garibaldi's Women" teams have also been formed in several regions of the country, forming the basis for the "People's Democratic Front Women's Association." The 26th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party recently called on demobilized former guerrillas to join the People's Democratic Front. The Farmers' Assembly, one of the Front's participants, is guiding agricultural workers and farmers in the struggle for land. Workers' Management Production Committees are particularly active in northern Italy, fighting to defend national industry against the destruction of local industries by monopolistic capitalists under the Marshall Plan. The committees have already taken over the Ancona shipyard and the oil refineries in the Po River basin that were shut down by reactionary capitalists, as well as several factories in Bologna and Milan. The "Christians for Peace Movement," which has joined the People's Democratic Front, is expanding among Catholic working people. Many important figures in the Republican Party and many of its local organizations, refusing to follow the policy of cooperation with the Gasperi police government advocated by party leader Pacciardi, have left the party and joined the People's Democratic Front. The leadership of the Labour Democratic Party and its parliamentary group stood with the People's Democratic Front from the very beginning.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: TASS Rome dispatch: The first National Congress of the Italian People's Democratic Front passed the Front's charter on the 1st. The main points are as follows: The People's Democratic Front unites all Italians who desire peace, labor, freedom, and national independence. It takes concrete measures to restore the country and civilized progress under the legal order of the republic and conditions of domestic and international peace. It carries out reforms of administrative institutions as stipulated by the fundamental principles of the constitution, guaranteeing the safety of all working people, the unemployed, those who have suffered from war, and veterans. The charter specifically stipulates: In agriculture: providing technical and financial assistance to small and medium-sized landowners, farmers, and cooperatives; reducing taxes on small and medium-sized landowners; confiscating the property of large landowners; and revising contracts for the use of land. In industry: recognizing "Workers' Management Factory Committees," eliminating bureaucratic interference, nationalizing large monopoly industries, and protecting small and medium-sized enterprises. In the recovery of southern Italy: implementing soil improvement in conjunction with land reform, guaranteeing democratic development, and formulating laws for the construction of public works. In state institutions: reforming administrative institutions, the military, and the police to achieve effective democratization, with the people managing the use of the state's main economic resources and administrative organs. Implementing local autonomy and reforming finance. In culture: opening schools for the people and developing research and scientific activities. People have the freedom to participate in all cultural activities and control the sources of funding for broadcasting, information, and newspapers. The charter also stipulates the protection of the rights of women and youth. The charter also stipulates the establishment of friendly cooperation and extensive barter policies with peace-loving and free countries. Abolishing monopolies on the purchase or sale of markets, protecting national sovereignty and independence, and never acting as a tool or battlefield in struggles contrary to the free world. The charter concludes by pointing out the methods to achieve the above goals: "Unite all forces in the working people who care about the fate of the country, freedom and labor. The working people should now stand at the forefront of the national salvation cause to overcome the selfish resistance of organized reactionary groups to maintain their privileges and to guarantee that the people's election promises are fulfilled." The charter points out: Defending the republic and democratic institutions cannot be left to the ruling class to dispose of freely. The ruling class is now mired in chaos and turmoil. The charter emphatically states: Loyalty to the charter is a reliable guarantee for achieving national unity, order, and welfare.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: Rome dispatch: L'Unità, the newspaper of the Italian Communist Party, commented on the first National Congress of the Italian People's Democratic Front, stating: "The People's Democratic Front is a long-term alliance of the progressive forces of the people." It pointed out: "For eight months, the people have not evaded the struggle; they have launched appropriate counterattacks against the enemy. The People's Democratic Front has been formed in this struggle, which is a manifestation of the unity that the Italian people demand. Now that the People's Democratic Front has been born, it will unite all those who are unwilling to submit to reactionary rule and organize and lead millions of Italian people in a counter-offensive." L'Unità concluded emphatically: "The struggles of the past eight months prove that the Italian people cannot be intimidated or suppressed. The emergence of the People's Democratic Front and its entry into battle prove that the people's power can not only organize resistance but also has the ability to launch a counter-offensive."
