　　Killing of Plough Cattle Must Stop
  　Lucheng Should Immediately Inspect and Prevent It
To the Editor:
    There is a lot of cattle slaughtering in various parts of Lucheng. In Gaozhuang Village, about forty head have been killed, and quite a few in other villages around Gaozhuang as well. They say they are old and sick cattle, approved by the county and district. But in reality, good cattle have been killed as well. For example, the No. 3 Brigade of ×× bought two head of cattle for the New Year, which were approved for slaughter by the county government. But one of them was a good ox. The leading comrades did not allow it to be slaughtered and used it to exchange for the village chief's sick ox. The village chief added 15,000 yuan (should have added more). After the village chief exchanged the ox, he sold it to a meat vendor to be slaughtered, earning 110,000 yuan in foreign currency. The above situation should be brought to the attention of everyone through the newspaper. It is best to prohibit the slaughter of cattle during the land reform period to prevent bad people from taking advantage of the situation.

　　不能乱杀耕牛
  　潞城应即检查制止编辑同志：
    潞城各地杀牛很多，高庄村杀了四十来头，高庄周围其它村也杀了不少，据他们说是老病牛，经县区批准的。但实际上有好牛被杀者，如××三大队过年买了两头牛，经县政府批准可以杀，但其中一头是个好牛，领导同志未让其杀，用它换了村长一条病牛，村长贴了一万五千元（本来应多贴的），而村长换了牛，又卖给肉锅上杀了，得洋十一万元。以上情形，请报纸公布全体注意。最好在土改期不准杀牛，以免被坏人钻空子。
