Soviet Army Founding Day
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. The origin of this festival is as follows:
    After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union in 1917, in order to consolidate the Soviet regime, it was necessary to emerge from the state of war, because continuing to fight Germany at that time was the biggest obstacle to the consolidation of the Soviet regime. Therefore, the Soviet government decided to negotiate with Germany and Austria. On February 10, 1918, the peace talks in Brest were interrupted. Although Lenin and Stalin, representing the Party Central Committee, insisted on signing the treaty, Trotsky, the chairman of the Soviet delegation to the Brest peace talks, betrayed and violated the direct instructions of the Bolshevik Party. He declared that the Soviet Republic refused to sign the treaty under the conditions demanded by Germany; at the same time, he informed the German army that the Soviet Republic would not wage war, and the army would continue to disband. This was exactly what the German bandits hoped for, and the German army took the opportunity to attack, putting the young Soviet Republic in a very dangerous situation. The German invasion also aroused a magnificent revolutionary upsurge in the Soviet Republic. In response to the call issued by the Party and the Soviet government -- "The socialist motherland is in danger" -- the working class responded by stepping up the organization of the Red Army. The new revolutionary people's army heroically resisted the German bandits. The German army was met with resolute resistance, and the offensive was stopped by the Red Army. The day of retaliation against the German imperialist army -- February 23 -- became the birthday of the young Red Army and was designated as the Soviet Army Founding Day. From then on, peace was achieved, allowing the Party to win time to organize a stronger Red Army and accumulate strength, so that it could defeat the White bandits and all enemies at home and abroad during the civil war.
    Thanks to the existence of the powerful Soviet Red Army, and even more thanks to the wise leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union overcame countless dangers and finally successfully built a socialist country, enabling the people to live an extremely happy and prosperous life, and giving the oppressed people of the world hope for liberation.
    During World War II, many countries in Eastern Europe were liberated by the Soviet Army, and our Northeast Liberated Area was also liberated by the Soviet Army's strike that defeated Japan and forced it to surrender. The Soviet Army was the decisive force in defeating German and Japanese imperialism, and it is also the decisive force in defending world peace and democracy now.

### 苏军建军节

　　苏军建军节
    今天是苏军建军三十周年纪念日；这个节日的来历是这样的：
    一九一七年苏联十月革命之后，为了巩固苏维埃政权，需要走出战争状态，因为当时和德国打下去是最妨碍苏维埃政权的巩固事业的。于是苏维埃政府决定和德奥进行谈判。一九一八年二月十日，在布勒斯特进行的和平谈判被中断了。虽然列宁和斯大林代表党中央坚持了签订和约的主张，可是到布勒斯特议和的苏维埃代表团主席托洛斯基却叛变式的违背了布尔什维克党的直接训令，他声明说苏维埃共和国拒绝在德国所要求的条件下签订和约；同时却又通知德军说，苏维埃共和国不会进行战争，而军队则继续遣散。这正是当时德国强盗所希望的，德军就乘机进攻了，使幼年的苏维埃共和国陷于很危险的境地。而德军的进犯在苏维埃共和国内也正引起了雄伟的革命高涨，为答复党和苏维埃政府所发出的号召--"社会主义祖国处在危险之中"，工人阶级就以加紧编制红军部队来响应了。新的革命人民的军队，英勇抵抗着德国强盗。德军受到坚决的回击，进攻是被红军阻止了。向德帝国主义军队实行回击的日子--二月二十三日，就成了年轻红军降生的日子，被定为苏联建军节。从这一后，实现了和平，使党嬴得了时间去组织更坚强的红军，积聚力量，到国内战争时期就得以击败了白匪，打败了国内外的一切敌人。
    由于有强大的苏联红军存在，更由于有列宁、斯大林的英明领导，苏联冲破了无数次艰险，终于建设成功了社会主义国家，使人民能够过着极其美满丰裕的生活，使世界上受压迫的人民也都有了解放的希望。
    在第二次世界大战中，东欧很多国家就是苏军解放的，咱们东北解放区也是苏军出兵一击把日本打得投降了而获得解放。苏军是打垮德、日帝国主义的决定力量，也是现在保卫世界和平民主的决定力量。（本报资料室）
