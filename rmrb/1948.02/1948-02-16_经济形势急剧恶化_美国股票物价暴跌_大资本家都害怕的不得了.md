Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the sharp drop in commodity prices currently occurring in the United States has rapidly become a major event of global attention. The price plunge began around February 4th. The Associated Press's wholesale price index for thirty-five commodities (with 1926 as 100) calculated the index after the plunge to be 195, dropping to 191.65 by the 9th, compared to 208.1 on January 9th of this year. American merchants say this is the largest price drop since the end of the war. This price collapse was led by grain prices, and grain, especially wheat prices, had consistently been at the forefront of price increases since the end of the war. The current situation has been reversed, with wheat, a staple food, falling at least 30 cents per bushel in three days. Corn, the most stable grain in the past few months, fell at least 24 cents per bushel (Note: U.S. bushel is approximately 3.4 *dou* in China). The prices of many other types of food and industrial raw materials have also fallen, including flour, sugar, pork, beef, lamb, lard, linseed oil, leather, cotton, and wool. As of the 13th, this collapse was continuing and showed no signs of stopping.

This US price collapse occurred when overall wholesale prices had risen to near the 1920 peak, a major reversal of the soaring prices since the US abolished price controls in June 1946. The Associated Press stated, "Wheat at three dollars a bushel is gone forever." The most notable feature of this reversal is a further decline after a decline, to the point of a collapse, rather than a rise after a decline. Most grain prices reached their peak on January 16th, began to decline the next day, continued to decline in the second week, and then turned into a collapse after the 4th of this month. This drop is by no means limited to commodity prices. According to the Associated Press, the price of the New York Stock Exchange, the center of the US financial market, also experienced a sharp drop at the same time, and business failures exceeded any similar period since 1942. Moreover, prior to the collapse, the US government's Federal Reserve Board announced that industrial production in December of last year had declined compared to previous months; and in the first half of January, department store sales declined more than the usual seasonal decline.

The US price collapse has caused "widespread unease" in New York, the financial capital of the United States. The New York Herald Tribune believes that "the decline in agricultural prices will lead to a decline in industrial goods prices." American business leaders have therefore developed well-founded fears. According to the Associated Press, "What they fear most is a sudden drop, which means a depression, which will cause all prices to fall, and businesses to stagnate, people will lose their jobs, and their incomes will fall so fast that they won't even have money to buy low-priced goods." According to an Associated Press dispatch from TASS in New York, "Most people associated with the American business community cannot hide their deep concern about the impending national situation, that the fall in stock and commodity prices will form the prelude to a sharp reversal of the economic situation." Not only in the United States, but also in countries around the world, "all countries are paying close attention to the trend of US prices, and the point of attention for each country is whether the recent sharp drop in US prices and stocks in the past three days is a prelude to the collapse of the US economy."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: TASS, New York, February 12th: The US price collapse and industrial stock decline continue. The report of the Du John commercial ruling body clearly reflects the severity of this situation. The report estimates that general commodity prices have fallen by 15.5% in the past few days. The Federal Reserve Board announced that loans to industry, agriculture, and commerce approved by the Federal Reserve Bank decreased significantly yesterday. In the week ending February 4th, these loans decreased by $83 million, indicating a deterioration of bank credit. The New York Post expressed concern about the economic situation, warning of a possible economic crisis.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th: New York: American industrialists and businessmen are panicking over the recent plunge in commodity and securities prices, and most fear that this may be the prelude to a larger economic collapse. According to an Associated Press report on the 8th, "This price collapse has quickly attracted nationwide attention in the United States, because the United States has long been plagued by talk of economic depression. Hard-hearted industrialists are thinking, is this a harbinger of a recession?" A United Press International dispatch on the 9th also stated: This collapse "increased the panic among American manufacturers, who have long anticipated the collapse of the wartime boom." The dispatch revealed that in their mixed commentaries, the mouthpieces of American big capitalists - the reactionary American newspapers - mostly expressed fear about this collapse, which portends a "sharp turn for the worse in the economic situation."

The price drop of grains and raw materials started in Chicago and other places, going from rising to falling sharply, with great momentum. The Associated Press called it a "historic event." The TASS report cited the agency's wholesale price index for 35 commodities (with 1926 as 100), pointing out that it had fallen to 191.65 on the 9th, while this index had been as high as 200.67 in early November last year. The Associated Press also stated that New York stock trading continued to decline when it opened on the 10th. Other commodities such as meat and butter also continued to fall. According to a United Press International dispatch on the 10th, news of price declines came from all over the country. Pork prices have fallen by two to seven dollars in two weeks, but Chicago still has 4,000 pigs that cannot be sold. Beef prices in the city also fell by half a dollar to three dollars, and most markets have a large number of foods that cannot be sold. The dispatch quoted a spokesman for the Retail Meat Merchants Association as saying that retail meat prices have fallen by 10% since the beginning of the year.

This US economic "upheaval" has attracted worldwide attention. Some capitalist countries have suffered serious adverse effects. For example, on the 10th, the Sydney Stock Exchange in Australia saw widespread declines in stock prices after brokers announced the fall in US prices and Cripps' recent economic warnings. "In fact, all markets were plunged into the biggest sell-off in a year," "resulting in a loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds in the price of major securities in one day" (Associated Press).

    经济形势急剧恶化
    美国股票物价暴跌
    大资本家都害怕的不得了
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：刻在美国发生的物价暴跌，已迅速成为全世界注目的重大事件。物价暴跌起始于本月四日前后。美联社对三十五种商品批发价格指数（一九二六年为一百）计算暴跌后之指数为一九五，九日已跌至一九一·六五，而在今年一月九日之指数为二○八·一。美国商人们说：这是战事结束以来最大规模的物价跌落。此次物价暴跌，以粮价带头，而谷物尤其是小麦价格，自战争结束以来，即一直被排列于物价上涨的前列。现在的形势则被倒转过来，主要食粮的小麦在三天之内每蒲式尔至少下跌三角。过去数月中最稳定的谷物玉蜀黍每蒲式尔至少下跌二角四分（按：美制每蒲式尔约合我国三·四斗）。许多其他种类之粮食及工业原料之价格亦已下跌，其中包括面粉、糖、猪肉、牛肉、羊肉、猪油、亚麻油、皮革、棉花及羊毛，截至十三日为止，此种暴跌仍在持续中，且无停滞象征。
    此次美国物价暴跌，发生于整个批发价格高涨至接近一九二○年物价最高峰之际，是一九四六年六月美国废除物价管制以来涨风狂吹的一大逆转。美联社称：“三美元一蒲式尔的小麦已一去不复返了”。此次逆转之显著特点为下降后之再下降，以至有暴跌，而并非下降后之再上升。大多数谷物价格在一月十六日达其最高峰，第二日即开始下降，第二周继续下降，至本月四日以后即转为暴跌。此次跌落绝非仅限于物价。据美联社称：美国金融市场的中心——纽约股票交易所的价格，在同时亦发生暴跌，而商业之倒闭，则超过自一九四二年以来任何同一时期。又，暴跌以前，据美政府联邦储备局宣布，去年十二月份之工业生产量已较前此数月下降；而在一月份的前半月中，百货公司销售量之下降，已较平常季节性的下降为多。
    美国物价暴跌发生之后，已引起美国金融首都纽约的“广泛不安”，纽约先驱论坛报认为：“农产品之跌价将使工业品跌价”。美国商业界领袖已因此发生十分有理由的恐惧。据美联社称：“他们最怕的是突然下跌，这就意味着萧条，从而使一切物价下跌，并使企业陷于停滞，人们将失掉工作，其收入跌落得这么快，以致连购买低物价物品的钱都没有”。又据美联社引塔斯社之纽约电讯称：“美国与商业界有关之多数人士，不能掩饰他们对于将临的国家情况的深切关怀，即股票及商品价格之跌落将形成经济形势急剧逆转的前奏”。不仅在美国，而且在全世界“各国，对美国物价趋势咸极注意，而各国注意之点为最近三日来美国物价及股票之突跌是否为美国经济崩溃之先兆”。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：美国物价暴跌和工业股票跌落仍继续中。杜·约翰商业统治机关的报告，清楚地反映了这种情形的严重性。该报告估计，过去数日内，一般商品价格跌落了百分之十五·五。联邦储备局宣布：联邦储备银行批准的工、农、商各业贷款昨日均有显著减少，在至二月四日为止的一周内，这类贷款已减少八千三百万美元，这表示了银行信用的恶化，纽约邮报对经济形势表示忧虑，警告可能发生经济危机。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】纽约讯：美国工商业家对最近物价及证券价格的暴跌，恐慌万状，大多害怕这可能是更大经济暴跌的先兆。据美联社八日报导：“这次价格暴跌迅速引起美国全国的注意，因为美国久已为经济萧条之说所烦恼。硬心肠的工业家心里在想，这就是不景气的预兆吗？合众社九日电亦称：这次暴跌“增加了美国制造商的恐慌，他们很久以来就预料战时的景气会崩溃”。该电透露，美国大资本家御用喉舌——美国反动报纸在其纷杂的评论中，对预示着“经济形势的急转直下”的这次暴跌大多表示恐惧。
    这次粮食及原料品的跌价，系由芝加哥等地开始，由上涨而下泻，来势甚猛，美联社称之为“历史性事件”。塔斯社所引该社三十五种商品批发价格的指数（以一九二六年为一百）指出，九日已跌至一九一点六五，而此项指数去年十一月初却曾高达二百点六七。美联社又称：纽约股票交易在十日开盘时，仍有跌落。其他商品如肉类、牛油等亦继续下跌。另据合众社十日电称，全国各地均传来物价下跌的消息。猪价两周来已跌了二元至七元，但芝加哥仍有四千口猪无法卖出。该市牛价也降落了半元至三元，大多数市场都有大批食物无法卖出。该电引零售肉商协会发言人称，零售肉价自年初以来已跌了百分之十。
    美国这次经济“大波动”，引起全世界的注意。某些资本主义国家已蒙受严重不利的影响，例如澳洲悉尼交易所十日在经纪人宣布美国物价下跌与克利浦斯最近所发的经济警告后，股票价格普遍下跌，实际上一切市场都陷入一年来最大的抛售浪潮中”，“致使主要证券价格一日内损失数十万镑”（美联社）。
