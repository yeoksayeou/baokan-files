    Northern University Holds University-Wide Meeting
    to Purge Zhai Shixian's Landlord Thoughts and Actions
    Zhai Remains Obstinate and Has Been Expelled from the Party and Removed from His Positions
    [Our Newspaper's News] On February 1st, the Northern University Student Committee General Assembly held a meeting in the school auditorium to conduct a serious ideological struggle against Zhai Moxinxin (Shixian), a class alien element who had infiltrated the Party. Except for the Art Institute, which was too far from the school headquarters to participate, comrades from the school headquarters and the various colleges of Liberal Arts and Education, Finance and Economics, Industry, Agriculture, and Medicine all participated, totaling more than 1,000 people.
    The meeting began at 10:00 AM, with Fan Wenlan, Zeng Yi, Zhang Zonglin, Le Tianyu, Chen Weishi, Xi Dongguang, Qin Siping, Liu Lie夫, and students Luo Juda (Engineering College), Wang Kongwen (Agricultural College), Li Longpan (Finance and Economics College), Li Xuecheng (Medical College), and Xu Jingwu (Liberal Arts and Education College), forming the presidium, chaired by Comrades Chen Weishi and Liu Lie夫. Comrade Chen Weishi reported on the significance of the meeting, saying, "Zhai Moxinxin is the worst typical bad Party member and bad cadre in the Northern University Party, so we are holding this meeting to educate him and let everyone criticize his bad thoughts, which is also self-education for everyone." Dean Zhang introduced Zhai's criminal history and his dishonest learning in the group. The chairman asked Zhai Moxinxin to sincerely confess to the masses, but he did not confess his crimes. He just put his hands in his pockets, swayed back and forth, and talked like he was lecturing, revealing an extremely contemptuous fake smile, putting a few empty hats on himself, and currying favor with his maid Wu Yan, saying, "I'm sorry to you," and that was it. Wu Yan's name in Zhai's house was Juhua; she was sold to Zhai's family for a silver dollar when she was five years old. Zhai was afraid that she would expose the inside story of the family, so he forcibly tied her to a cart and dragged her out the year before last. She complained about her suffering, recounting the miserable scene of kneeling on the stove bars and in the snow all day without being allowed to get up. She sobbed uncontrollably, and many people were moved to tears. Then, the comrades criticized him and educated him, showing a high degree of righteous indignation. Some comrades revealed that Zhai had been a puppet soldier in 1938 and pointed out that he had never awakened. Some comrades were so angry that they could hardly speak: "You have consistently opposed the leadership, sowed discord... In Taiyue, you opposed Wang Xinting..." and further exposed Zhai's four trips home, sabotaging land reform, stealing the fruits of the struggle, threatening and scolding village cadres, and releasing ten targets of struggle, insulting the revolutionary mass movement.... More and more people were submitting notes requesting to speak, and the masses' hatred was clearly rising. It was not until the presidium announced, "We will discuss punishment tonight," that everyone calmed down.
    When the meeting continued with gas lamps lit, the masses were even more energetic. The comrades' speeches were often interrupted by angry slogans. When analyzing Zhai's thoughts and actions, the masses shouted, "Zhai Moxinxin is not a Communist Party member, but a Kuomintang member!" When it was mentioned that Zhai should repay his blood debt for sabotaging land reform, the masses shouted, "Oppose the landlord element Zhai Moxinxin who refuses to surrender his gun, and tell him to get out!" Someone analyzed the legal aspects of Zhai's crimes according to the Outline Land Law and the decrees promulgated by the Border Government and suggested that he be handed over to the People's Court for handling, and the masses unanimously shouted, "We agree!" Zhai Moxinxin's ugly face was nakedly exposed. He was no longer as arrogant and domineering as he had been at the beginning of the meeting, putting on the airs of a landlord. Sixty-four people had already spoken, and one hundred and four more were waiting to speak, and many more were continuing to submit notes. In order to give more people the opportunity to speak, the presidium announced free speech, with a maximum of three minutes per person. Often, before one person finished speaking, the sound of slogans would erupt at the same time.
    A burst of angry slogans shouted, "Zhai Moxinxin is a sinner of the people! A black spot on the Party!" The masses' hatred had risen to an uncontrollable level, and the angry applause was deafening. It was not until the chairman announced that he would invite the Dean of Academic Affairs to make a concluding speech that the meeting place became quiet again. Comrade Zeng Yi analyzed and criticized the landlord element Zhai Moxinxin in a firm voice. Principal Fan Wenlan appeared on the podium amidst warm and welcoming applause. He cordially encouraged everyone and finally solemnly put forward two points: First, check whether there are still class alien elements in the Northern University who insist on their original positions; second, the landlord and rich peasant thoughts in our minds must be eliminated. The chairman led everyone in shouting slogans such as "Strive for the victory of the three investigations and learning in the Northern University!" Everyone dispersed from the meeting with the firm confidence of resolutely cleansing the landlord and rich peasant thoughts in their minds. Everyone cheered for a while, and it was already nearly midnight.
    Furthermore, the Northern University General Branch Committee and the Student Committee General Assembly, after careful consideration, have decided on the punishment for Zhai Moxinxin. Because Zhai insisted on his landlord class position and refused to change after repeated education, it was decided to expel him from the Party, remove him from his position as acting director and teacher of the fifth class of the Liberal Arts and Education College, and send him back to his hometown by militiamen for review and punishment by the masses.

    北方大学召开全校大会
    清算翟士贤地主思想行为
    翟仍执迷不悟已被开除党籍撤销职务
    【本报消息】二月一日，北大学委总会为着对混进党内的阶级异己分子翟墨新（士贤）进行严肃的思想斗争，在校部礼堂召开了一个大会。除艺术学院因离校部较远未能参加外，校部及文教、财经、工、农、医各学院的同志们都参加了，共一千多人。
    上午十时大会开始，由学委总会提出的范文澜、曾毅、张宗麟、乐天宇、陈唯实、习东光、秦思平、刘列夫及同学罗巨达（工学院）、王孔文（农学院）、李龙蟠（财经学院）、李学成（医学院）、徐静吾（文教学院）等十三位同志组成主席团，由陈唯实、刘列夫二同志主持会议。陈唯实同志报告开会意义说：“翟墨新是北大党内最坏的一个典型坏党员、坏干部，因此开大会教育他，让大家批判他的坏思想，同时也是大家的自我教育。”张院长介绍了翟的罪恶历史和他在小组上不老实的学习情况。主席叫翟墨新向群众诚恳坦白，但他并不坦白自己的罪恶，只两手向裤兜一插，摆来摆去，好象讲书一样，露着极端轻蔑的假笑给自己戴了几个空帽子，拉拢一下他的丫头武炎说：“我对不起你，”就算完了。武炎在翟家的名字叫做菊花，是五岁上一块现洋卖到翟家的。翟怕她暴露家中的内货，在前年硬把她缚在车上拉出来了。她诉苦，说到跪在炉条上，跪在雪地上一天不叫起来的凄惨情景，她泣不成声了，有不少人激动的流了泪。接着，大家同志批评他教育他，表现了高度的义愤。有的同志揭穿翟在三八年当过伪军。并指出他一直不觉悟。有些同志气得几乎话也说不好了：“你一贯的反领导，挑拨离间……在太岳，你反对王新亭………。”并进一步揭露翟四次回家，破坏土改，窃取斗争果实，威胁辱骂村干，还放走十个斗争对象，侮辱革命的群运……。递条子要求发言的人越来越多，群众的仇恨情绪显然是越来越高了。直到主席团宣布：“晚上再谈处分。”大家才平息下来。
    点着汽灯继续开会时，群众的精神更旺盛了。同志们的发言往往被愤怒的口号所打断。当分析到翟的思想行为时，群众就高呼：“翟墨新不是共产党员，是国民党员！”说到翟应当偿还破坏土改的血债，群众就高呼：“反对不缴枪的地主分子翟墨新，叫他滚出去！”有人根据土地法大纲及边府公布的法令分析翟所犯罪行的法律部分应交人民法庭处理，群众就一致高呼：“赞成！”翟墨新的罪恶面貌赤裸裸的摆出来了，他再不象刚开会那样的盛气凌人，摆地主的臭架子了。已经有六十四人发过言，还有一百零四人在等着发言，还有好多人在继续递条子。为着使更多的人有发言机会，主席团宣布了自由发言，一个人至多三分钟。往往一个人的话还没完，喊口号的声音就同时发作。
    一阵愤怒的口号喊着：“翟墨新是人民的罪人！党的黑点！”群众的仇恨已经高涨到不可抑制，愤怒的掌声剧烈的响着。直到主席宣布请教务长作总结性的发言，会场才又安静下来。曾毅同志用坚实的声音把地主分子翟墨新分析批判了，校长范文澜老在热烈的欢迎掌声中出现主席台上，他亲切地鼓舞了大家，最后严肃的提出两点：第一，查北大还有没有坚持原立场的阶级异己分子存在；第二，脑子的地富思想要去掉。主席领导大家呼“为北大三查学习的胜利而奋斗”等口号，大家抱着坚决清洗脑子里地富思想的信心散会了。大家欢呼了一阵，时已近夜半十二点钟。
    又讯：北大总支委会和学委总会经过慎重考虑，已决定了对翟墨新的处分。因为翟坚持他的地主阶级立场，经多次教育仍执迷不改，决予开除党籍，撤销他文教院第五班代理主任兼教员的职务，并交民兵带回原籍由群众审查、处分。
