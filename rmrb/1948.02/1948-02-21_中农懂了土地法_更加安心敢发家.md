　　Middle peasants generally support the Land Law. However, some middle peasants, because they are not yet clear about the spirit of the policy, and with the addition of rumors spread by landlords and bad cadres, have shown panic. For example, Chen Kun and Liu Jingxin, middle peasants in Putong Village, Shahe, said: "We are not afraid of equal distribution, but we are afraid of being labeled as a 'struggle target'." Qin Yuanjin, a woman from Henan Village, Licheng, said: "We can't participate in the poor and hired peasant groups organized in our village. Since we are middle peasants, aren't you afraid of struggling against us! These days, I am not enthusiastic about spinning." Wang Duofu, a middle peasant in Daguang, Third District, Zuoquan, sold his donkey for fear of equal distribution. Li Yintong, who originally didn't have enough grain to eat, heard that the Land Law required him to sell grain. Cheng Youxiang, a middle peasant in Dongliukai Village, Cixian, said: "There is a major land reform! I harvested three shi of corn and two shi of millet in the autumn, and I want to sell it all."
    The anxiety of the middle peasants is temporary. After correctly explaining the Land Law, the emotions of the middle peasants will quickly stabilize. They will seek reliance on the poor and hired peasants, agree to equal distribution, and actively engage in production. For example, in Xiaqu Village, Shahe, the village cadres used to read newspapers for propaganda, but the middle peasants did not believe it. After the students from the Three Highs went to correctly publicize the Land Law, the middle peasants said: "If we had known this earlier, we wouldn't have panicked!" Cheng Shenglai, a middle peasant in Donglianghou, Wuxiang, said: "This outline is very good for me. In the past, I didn't dare to prosper because I was afraid that good people would be 'moved' against. This time, after the equal distribution, those who should be allocated will get some, and those that should not be moved will not be moved. Some of the land that is plentiful and good will be taken out, which is fair. There will be no more movements in the future. Now my heart is stable, and I dare to prosper." Some middle peasants in Xingtai were initially afraid of being struggled against and wanted to "voluntarily" take out a few mu of land. After correctly publicizing the Land Law, they learned that the movable property of middle peasants would not be touched, and only wealthy middle peasants would be asked to take out some of their surplus land through consultation. Zhang Qili, a middle peasant in Zhangdong Village, bought a mule to engage in production, and Li Fang also borrowed 280,000 yuan from the village credit cooperative to buy a mule and build a cart to pull loads outside.
    From these situations, we should strive to expand the publicity of the Land Law and explain it to the middle peasants more. Not only should we stabilize their emotions and dispel their doubts and misunderstandings, but we should also make them aware that the Land Law has actual benefits for them, that they have a place in politics, and that in the future they will be absorbed into farmers' associations and government work. We should inspire them to truly rely on the poor and hired peasants, join hands with the poor and hired peasants, unite closely together to fight against feudal remnants, and equally distribute land together to strive for democratic rights and fair burdens.

### 中农懂了土地法  更加安心敢发家

　　中农懂了土地法  更加安心敢发家
    广大中农是拥护土地法的。也有些中农因为还不明确政策的精神，再加地主、坏干部的造谣，表现了恐慌。如沙河普通庄中农陈昆、刘景心说："平分俺也不怕，只怕落'斗争对象'名。"黎城河南村妇女秦远金说："咱村组织贫雇小组咱不能参加，又是中农，你怕不斗争咱哩！这几天，我纺织也不起劲。"左权三区大光中农王多富，怕平分就把驴卖了。李银同本来打的粮食不够吃，听了土地法还要粜粮食。磁县东六开村中农程有祥说："土地大改革哩！我秋天收了三石玉茭子，两石谷子，我都要卖了它。"
    中农的不安是暂时的，经过正确解释土地法以后，中农情绪很快的就会安定了下来，向贫雇找依靠，赞成平分，并且积极生产了。如沙河霞渠村，早先村干部读报宣传，中农都不相信。到三高学生去正确宣传土地法后，中农都说："早知道这样，可不心慌啦！"武乡东良候中农程身来说："这大纲对我很好，以前我就不敢发家，害怕闹好人家给'运动'了。这次平分后，该分的分上些，不动的不动，地多又好的抽一些，都公道了，以后就不运动了。我现在心就安定了，也敢发家了。"邢台有些中农起先怕斗，想"自动"拿出几亩地来。正确宣传土地法后，知道了中农浮财不动，只是富裕中农才用协商方式拿出多余的一些土地。张东村中农张起礼就买了一头骡子闹生产，李芳也在村信用部贷了二十八万元，买了骡子修了大车，到外面去拉脚。
    从这些情形看，我们应该努力扩大宣传土地法，多多给中农解释。不但要稳定他们的情绪，去掉他们的疑惑和误解，还要使他们知道土地法对他们有实际利益，在政治上有他们的地位，将来还要吸收他们参加农会和政权工作。启发他们真正依靠贫雇，同贫雇农拉起手来，亲密团结一起向封建残余进行斗争，一起平分土地争取民主权利和公平负担。
