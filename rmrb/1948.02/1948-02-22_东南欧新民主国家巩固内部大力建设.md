Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 20th: Comprehensive Report: The new democratic countries of Poland, Romania, and Albania are further consolidating their internal affairs and vigorously engaging in construction. In Poland, the Central Joint Committee of Democratic Parties approved the Polish Peasant Party's request to join the committee on the 8th, thereby strengthening the "struggle against reactionaries" (TASS). At the same time, the Polish government decided to allocate 39.3 billion rubles this year for construction work, a sharp increase of 17 billion rubles compared to last year. In Romania, according to a report in the Romanian Communist Party's newspaper: Romanian political parties will organize a strong People's Democratic Front to consolidate and develop the young republic. The conditions for establishing this front are now ripe, and the merger congress of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party was held on the 17th. The Peasants' Front has expelled wealthy peasant elements from its leadership and has joined with the Peasants' Party to form a united front of working peasants. In addition, unified organizations of democratic women and youth in Romania have also been established. On the other hand, as a result of vigorous construction, people's living standards are improving day by day. Grain prices have fallen by 30 to 50 percent in the past two months, doubling people's purchasing power and filling the market with prosperity. Bucharest has recently established 124 new state-owned stores. Albania recently presented a draft plan for the development of the national economy in 1948 in order to further improve people's living standards and consolidate national defense. The plan stipulates the laying of new railways, and oil production must increase by 150 percent compared to last year. Last year's oil production increased sharply by 179 percent compared to the previous year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 19th: Sofia Dispatch: The Second National Congress of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front issued a declaration on the 8th stating that the new program adopted by the Second Congress of the Fatherland Front has presented the Bulgarian people with enormous tasks. That is, in a short period of time, Bulgaria must be made an advanced industrial and agricultural country, with consolidated economic and defense forces, and the people's living standards and cultural level should be improved. The declaration calls on the working people to rise up and struggle to increase productivity, strengthen labor discipline, and promote labor competition; calls on farmers not to leave a single piece of land uncultivated and to do everything possible to develop agriculture; calls on young people to dedicate themselves to the country's rejuvenation; and calls on the people's army to improve military training and enhance combat effectiveness to defend the peaceful labor of the Bulgarian people at home and the independence of the People's Republic.
