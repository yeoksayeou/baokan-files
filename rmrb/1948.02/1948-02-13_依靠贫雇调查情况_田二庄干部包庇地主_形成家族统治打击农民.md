Relying on Poor and Hired Peasant Investigation
Tian'erzhuang Cadres Harbor Landlords
Forming Family Rule to Suppress Peasants
Too Much Difference in Land Fertility
Large Grain Deficit for Poor and Hired Peasants

[This newspaper's news] Working personnel in Tian'erzhuang, Wu'an County, have initially learned about the main situation of the village through visits to poor and hired peasants, and have gained experience in visiting them. The following is a brief report on the situation:

Tian'erzhuang has 1370.5 mu of land, 100 households, and 342 people (including 33 soldiers and staff working outside), with an average of 4.07 mu of land per person. According to an investigation of 16 poor peasant households, their urgent requirement after the land reform is to adjust some good land. The general quality of their land is very poor. The 16 households have a total of 37 people and 171.5 mu of land, an average of 4.36 mu per person, which is higher than the average; however, the quality is too poor. Of the 171.5 mu, only 50.6 mu are good land, an average of 0.89 mu per person (based on 13 households). Nine out of the 16 households should be supplemented in this way. On the other hand, cadres and those related to cadres have occupied all or most of the good land. For example, the village head was dirt poor before rent reduction, but now has 20.797 mu of good land with no bad land, an average of 4.16 mu per person. The political director is an old middle peasant who exchanged bad land for good land during the land reform. His family of six has 27.34 mu of good land, an average of 4.55 mu per person (according to the poor peasants). These two households have a total of 48.137 mu of good land, almost equal to the total amount of good land of the 16 poor peasant households. The disparity in fertility can be seen. Secondly, the grain problem is very serious. Half of the 16 households will not receive grain until next summer, and six of them are short of more than one dan. This issue must be addressed when dividing the land equally.

The political characteristic of Tian'erzhuang is the terrifying family rule of the village cadres. Among the 14 cadres including the political director, seven are old middle peasants and seven are new middle peasants. Among them, nine are called "Director" (the masses call the political director "Director"). The village head - a group of people surnamed Yang and his nephews - has 12 cadres among their 13 party members, who control finance and militia power. In addition, the four brothers and three nephews of the political director, and the two brothers of the village head are their henchmen, standing over the masses. If anyone disagrees with them, they threaten to "throw them into West Gully" (meaning to kill them). Last spring (lunar calendar), when the masses demanded the struggle against the landlord Yang Chunfa (who was adopted by the landlord as the brother of the Director), "the whole gang" roared on the spot and threatened to throw the poor peasant Yang Xiangzi, who had made the proposal, into the West Gully. The masses were suppressed. This new type of feudal terror rule is still continuing today, but it is also changing. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the cadres sold bricks, tiles, and trees, spread rumors of egalitarianism, and said that grain and property would be equally divided. They ate dumplings lavishly during the solar new year, causing panic among the middle peasants. After we arrived in the village, we repeatedly explained the Land Law, and the poor peasants were happy and came to us. The middle peasants gradually stabilized. The cadres resisted us head-on, monitored us, and sent people to stand guard on our rooftops at night. They sarcastically said to the poor peasants, "Let's elect you as the chairman of the peasant association!" On the one hand, we explained the Land Law and exposed the cadres' illegal actions in the winter school and among the poor peasants. On the other hand, we convened cadres and party members, talked about the "Letter to Party Members," and pointed out their way out. At this time, the cadres began to differentiate, and some were willing to accept our education. The worse ones did not dare to openly resist. However, we did not seize the opportunity to educate them, but one-sidedly emphasized applying pressure. As a result, the village head led his family group and organized and planned an attack on the poor peasants. The village head knowingly violated the law and sold 76 sheep. Zhang Tianyi, the most frantic of the "Director's" nephews (the nephew of the sheltered landlord Yang Chunfa), deliberately raised ultra-leftist opinions in the winter school, removed the preferential treatment director Yang Eryou from his position, fined the middle peasant Hu Long, and provoked discord between the middle and poor peasants. On December 23rd, in the winter school, the village head and Zhang Tianyi and others struggled against the poor peasant Yang Sheng, who had engaged in hooliganism, interrogated the "Poor Peasant Corps," and attempted to detain Yang Sheng, attempting to crush the Poor Peasant Corps in one fell swoop (they believed that the Poor Peasant Corps had been established and that Yang Sheng was the leader, but in fact, the Poor Peasant Corps had not yet been organized). Three days later, the village head was removed from his position for selling sheep, and most of the cadres lowered their heads, but the "Director" was still surrounded by that gang, attempting to maintain their rule and suppress the poor peasants. After the above experience, the poor peasants saw that the district was supporting them, became bolder, more confident, and more united, and their activities became more active.

Stand Firm on Position, Gain Trust of Poor and Hired Peasants

In half a month, we investigated 30 poor and hired peasant households. At first, they were afraid, but later they could talk about the general situation. After figuring out our bottom line - who we were supporting - they gradually told us their innermost thoughts. Recently, many people who have suffered extreme injustice have come to us personally to tell us things they would never tell anyone else. Currently, it appears that nine people are relatively active and steadfast, and six of them have the four major qualifications of a core figure - working year-round, being upright, selfless, and enthusiastic about serving everyone. They are gradually forming a leading core, discussing things in advance, reviewing them later, and proceeding in an orderly manner without confusion. In short, the relationship between the poor and hired peasants and our working personnel in the village in the past half month is a process of mutually probing and investigating, and gradually trusting each other. The poor and hired peasants' investigation and research into us is extremely meticulous and cautious, and they will never easily believe us. Therefore, our every word and deed must be very careful, firmly standing on the side of the poor and hired peasants, and telling them our bottom line through our words and actions, so that they believe us, respond to the party's call - equal distribution and the poor and hired peasants taking charge, and consciously and voluntarily rise up to fight for their own liberation. In other words, the process of probing is the process of enlightening the masses. If this step is done well, there will be a foundation for organizing the Poor Peasant Corps, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences in the next step. Otherwise, they will not follow us. How to probe their bottom line, enlighten their consciousness, and respond to the Land Law Outline? In half a month, we passed two hurdles and reached the point where we trust each other today, and they are consciously acting.

First, break the fear of cadre retaliation and establish the idea of the poor and hired peasants taking charge. They said: Who dares to provoke them (referring to the cadres)? They are all one family. If we give them opinions, it will be like that time of "washing your face and wiping it black", do you want your life or not? What will happen after you leave? (Unable to figure out the bottom line of the district) Who dares to provoke them? They have roots above. At this time, we lectured on the Land Law Outline, read newspapers, and spoke about the new spirit in the winter school and among the poor peasants, making it clear that this time we were not supporting "both sides," but only supporting the masses. At the same time, we educated them through our actions, living in their homes and eating together. They said, "Old Li (Kuiting) used to live in the landlord's house for two or three years, and Old Wang came to investigate the work and lived in the cadres' house, but neither of them ever came to our house." They are willing to associate with us. We went to the poorest and most oppressed people's homes. The people there said, "Who has ever come to our house? Who has ever looked up to us?" They felt immense comfort and honor. Other poor peasants also felt that we were sincerely on the side of the poor. When talking to the cadres, they listened outside and heard us asking the cadres to bow their heads to the masses and criticizing them for occupying too many fruits. They saw that we were indeed only supporting them. The first hurdle of fearing cadre retaliation began to be broken, and they wanted to take charge.

The second hurdle is that the "old wood" (as the poor and hired peasants call themselves) is not good enough, "We don't know how to speak, can't read, and haven't done anything before," "They (the cadres) are all old cadres, we can't talk them down." At this time, we carried out the "ability" class education: who to speak for, who to work for, what to say, what is called being able to speak and being able to work. We carried out the four major standards of cadres' education, only "honest people" will work for the poor, and encouraged their confidence. In the winter school, we studied the Land Law, discussed issues, and trained them, explaining from their actions that only they speak the truth and know how to speak.

Then, they dared to do it, but felt "few in number and weak in strength," so we carried out the education of uniting the middle peasants, and studied the specific targets and contacted them separately. In this way, after passing the two hurdles, the core figures gradually emerged, and their activities became more and more active.

What is the key to getting close to the masses? It lies in whether we actually believe in the masses. We say we believe in the masses in words, but how can we be close to the masses if we don't believe in them or don't fully believe in them? In the past half month, under the correct leadership of the party and the earnest education of the poor and hired peasants, we have broken and are breaking the following ideological obstacles, and gradually the relationship with the masses has become closer.

Sincerely Accept the Criticism of the People

1.  We took the narrow viewpoint of the poor and hired peasants as the viewpoint of the masses, only liked the poor and hired peasants, and held deep hatred for the cadres regardless of the size of their mistakes or the degree of their awareness; we were somewhat indifferent to the middle peasants. The poor and hired peasants felt "weak in strength" and criticized us for "not getting angry" at the cadres, and demanded to unite the middle peasants. They educated us that the interests of the poor and hired peasants are not guaranteed when they do not represent the interests of the majority of people (including the middle peasants).

2.  We replaced the mobilization of the broad masses of poor and hired peasants with the mobilization of active elements. When we saw the poor and hired peasant masses in the middle and backward states with many concerns, not active, and wavering, we expressed indifference and even aversion. We did not understand that the purpose of mobilizing active elements is to mobilize the broad masses in the middle and backward strata. Only when they are conscious and take action can there be a mass movement.

3.  We were fooled by Yang Sheng, who had hooliganistic habits, and treated the hooligan as an active element. In order to get the landlord's daughter-in-law, he actively "colluded" with the poor and hired peasants, causing some leakers and "selfish" elements to sneak into the poor and hired peasant group, attacked the cadres, broke away from the masses, and took the path of "leniency first, then strictness" of Dawan.

4.  We incorrectly treated the shortcomings of the masses. We disliked and even hated the "rogue" habits of the poor and hired peasant bachelors getting women, and saying that they were poor in order to get some things when dividing the land equally, and lacked a class-based sympathetic attitude, which affected the work of approaching and transforming them.

5.  Is it okay to use honest poor and hired peasants as the backbone? Is their fighting spirit strong? "Old wood" "cannot make mistakes," this is their own answer. The incident of cadres fighting Yang Sheng tested them, and they are the most steadfast and have the strongest fighting spirit.

6.  Don Quixote-style paternalistic work style. We do not know how to mobilize the masses to rise up and do it themselves. Criticizing village cadres and educating hooliganistic elements were all done by ourselves. We often got angry about unfair things, "The poor are full of tears and sorrows," "I am full of anger," which became my catchphrases. We were afraid that the masses would "fail" and wanted to "save" the situation ourselves. It seemed that everything in Tian'erzhuang depended on ourselves, and we did not know how to rely on the masses, resulting in "efforts that do not pay off." The cadres resisted greatly, the poor and hired peasants were isolated, and we ourselves were worried about being shot in the back. The cadres and landlords combined and, by attacking the hooligan Yang Sheng, launched a massive counterattack against the poor and hired peasants, causing great damage to the morale of the poor and hired peasants. From this, we learned that we are insignificant and incapable, and only by mobilizing the masses to consciously and voluntarily rise up, criticize the cadres, educate hooliganistic elements, and get angry at unfair things—only then will there be strength, cadres will bow their heads, hooligans will be transformed, unfair things will be eliminated, and the masses will truly stand up and truly be in charge.

The above are the problems encountered in the past half month. Without solving these problems, without this minimum mass concept - the concept of believing in the masses - simply talking about methods and ways to get close to the masses is impossible to get close to the masses and may even lead to detachment from the masses. Conversely, believing in the masses by one point will bring us closer to the masses by one point, and there will be one more way to do things. (Gengsheng, Han Bing, Li Jue)

    依靠贫雇调查情况
    田二庄干部包庇地主
    形成家族统治打击农民
    土地肥瘦相差太多
    贫雇缺粮窟窿很大
    【本报消息】武安田二庄工作人员，在访贫雇中初步了解到该村的主要情况，并取得访问贫雇的经验。现将其概略情况，报导如下：
    田二庄土地一三七○·五亩，人一○○户，三四二口（包括在外战士与工作人员三三人），每人平均土地四·○七亩。据十六户贫农调查，土地改革后，他们的迫切要求是调剂一些好地。他们的土地一般的质量都很坏。十六户共三七人，土地一七一·五亩，每人平均四·三六亩，尚超过平均数；但质量太差，一七一·五亩中，好地只占五○·六亩，每人平均·八九亩（以十三户均）。象这样应补入者十六户中占九户。另一方面，干部及与干部有关者，全部或大部，侵占了好地。例如村长减租前是赤贫，现有好地二○·七九七亩，无坏地，每人平均四·一六亩。政治主任是老中农，土地改革中坏地换好地，六口人，好地二七·三四亩，每人平均四·五五（以上据贫农谈）。这二户共好地四八·一三七亩，几与十六户贫农好地总数相等，肥瘦悬殊可见一斑。其次，粮食问题甚为严重，十六户中接不到明夏者即有半数，其中缺一石以上者有六户。平分土地时须注意解决此问题。
    田二庄的政治特点，是村干的家族的恐怖统治。政治主任等十四个干部中，七个老中农，七个新中农。其中九个是“主任”（群众称政治主任为主任）。村长——杨姓的一股子及其外甥十三个党员中有十二个是干部，掌握着财政与民兵的大权。再加上政治主任的四弟兄三外甥，村长的两弟兄为其爪牙，站在群众的头上，谁不如他们的意，他们便恫吓说：“扔到西沟去”（捣死之意）。去年春天（阴历）群众要求斗争地主杨春发（系主任之哥过继与地主者），他们那“一窝蜂”当场咆哮起来，要把提议的贫农杨祥子扔到西沟去。群众被打击下去。这种新式封建的恐怖统治，今天还在继续着，但也在变化着。土地法大纲公布后，干部即卖砖瓦树木，造谣大均产，粮食财产都平分。过阳历年，大吃饺子。中农恐慌。我们到村后，反复的讲解了土地法，贫农欢喜，找我们；中农渐安定；干部正面抵抗，监视我们，夜间派人到我们房上站岗；讽刺贫农说：“选你当农会主任吧！”我们一方面在冬学里，在贫农群里讲土地法，揭穿干部违法行动；一方面召集干部党员，讲告党员书，指出其出路。这时干部开始分化，一部分人愿接受我们的教育；较坏的一部分人也不敢公开抵抗；但我们未抓紧教育，片面的强调施用压力，结果以村长为首带领其家族集团，有组织的有计划的向贫农进攻，村长明知故犯，卖羊七十六只。“主任”外甥（即包庇下来的地主杨春发的外甥）张天义最为疯狂，在冬学里故意提出过左意见，把优抗主任杨二友撤职，罚中农胡龙，挑拨中农贫农间的团结。十二月二十三日冬学里，村长与张天义等斗争有流氓行为的贫农杨生，追问“贫农团”，要扣押杨生，企图一举打垮贫农团（他们认为贫农团已建立起来，杨生是团长，其实贫农团尚未组织）。过了三天，村长因卖羊被撤职，大部干部低头，但“主任”仍被那一伙子包围着，企图保持其统治，把贫农打下去。贫农经过以上经验，看到了区上给自己撑腰，胆愈大，信心愈高，团结愈坚，活动愈积极了。
  行动站稳立场  取得贫雇信任
    半月中共调查了三十户贫雇，开头他们害怕，以后可以谈一般情况，在摸清我们的底——为谁撑腰——之后，他们逐渐将心底话告诉我们。近来更有许多受过奇冤大苦的人亲自找来，告诉我们永不告人的话。目前看来，有九个人较积极坚定，其中有六个人具备了核心人物的四大条件——长年劳动，为人正派，大公无私，热心为大家办事。他们逐渐形成领导核心，遇事先商议，后检查，有步骤不紊乱。总之，半月来贫雇与我们在该村的工作人员的关系是互相摸底，互相调查，逐渐相信的过程。贫雇对于我们的调查研究是万分细密与慎重的，决不轻易的相信我们。因此我们的一言一语，一举一动，都必须十分谨慎，坚定的站在贫雇方面，从言语行动中，把我们的底告诉他们，使他们相信我们，响应党的号召——平分与贫雇当家，自觉自动的起来为自己的解放而奋斗。换句话说，摸底的过程，就是启发群众觉悟的过程，这一步做得好，下一步组织贫农团、农会、农代会才有基础。否则，他们是不跟我们走的。如何摸他们的底，启发他们的觉悟，响应土地法大纲呢？半月中过了两关，达到了今天彼此相信，他们自觉的活动起来的地步。
    首先，打破怕干部报复的心理，树立贫雇当家的思想。他们说：谁敢惹人家（指干部）？人家都是一家子。给人家提了意见，又和那一次洗脸擦黑一样，还要命不要？你们走了怎样办？（摸不清区上的底）谁敢惹人家？人家上边有根。这时我们在冬学里在贫农群里讲土地法大纲，读报，讲新精神，表明这次不是“两头”撑腰，只撑群众的腰。同时从行动上教育他们，我们住在他们家里，一块吃饭。他们说：“从前老李（魁庭）住在地主家二三年，老王来调查工作，住在干部家里，都没有到我们这里来过”。他们愿意和我们来往。我们到最穷最受气的人家去，本人说：“谁到咱家里来过，谁看起咱了”，感到莫大安慰与荣幸。其他贫农也感到我们是真心向着穷人。对干部说话，他们在外边听着，听到我们要干部向群众低头，批评其多占果实，他们看到我们确乎是只撑他们的腰。怕干部报复的第一关开始突破，他们想要当家了。
    第二关是“老木头”（贫雇自称）不行，“咱们不会说话，不认字，没有办过事”，“人家（干部）都是老干部，咱说不过人家”。这时我们进行“能力”阶级性的教育：为谁说话，为谁办事，说什么话，啥叫会说话，会办事。进行干部的四大标准的教育，只有“老气人”（老实人）才会给穷人办事，鼓舞他们的信心。在冬学里研究土地法，讨论问题，锻炼他们，从行动上说明只有他们才说真理，才会说话。
    接着，他们敢于干了，又感到“人少势孤”，于是进行了团结中农的教育，并研究了具体对象，分头联系。这样，过了两关，核心人物逐渐看出来，活动越积极。
    接近群众的关键何在？在于我们实际上相信不相信群众。我们口头上说相信群众，但实际上如不相信或不完全相信群众，那样还说得上接近群众吗？半月来我们是在党的正确领导与贫雇的谆谆教育之下，打破了与打破着以下几个思想障碍，逐步的与群众的关系密切起来。
  诚恳接受人民的批评
    一、以狭隘的贫雇观点当做群众观点，只喜欢贫雇，对于干部却不分错误大小，觉悟程度，有深恶痛绝的情绪；对于中农有些冷淡。贫雇感到“势孤”，批评我们对干部“不要发脾气”，要求团结中农。他们教育了我们不代表大多数人（即包括中农在内的）的利益时，贫雇利益是没有保障的。
    二、以发动积极分子代替了发动广大贫雇阶层，对于中间状态与落后状态的贫雇群众，看到他们顾虑多，不积极，有动摇时，则表示冷淡，甚至有讨厌情绪。不了解发动积极分子的目的是为了发动广大中间与落后阶层，只有他们觉悟，并行动起来，才有群众运动。
    三、上了有流氓习气的杨生的当，以流氓当作积极分子。他为了把地主的媳妇弄到手，积极“串连”贫雇，弄得贫雇群里混进几个走风漏气，“自私自利”分子，打击干部，脱离群众，走了“先宽后严”的大湾路。
    四、错误的对待群众的缺点，对于贫雇光棍搞女人等二流子习气，为了平分时补入些东西而说自己穷等等看不惯，甚至讨厌，缺乏阶级的同情态度，影响接近与改造他们的工作。
    五、以老实贫雇当骨干，究竟行不行？他们斗争性强不强？“老木头”“走不了错误”，这是他们自己的答复。从干部斗争杨生的事件中考验了他们，他们是最坚定的，斗争性最强的。
    六、唐吉诃德式的包办代替的作风。不知发动群众自己起来干。批评村干部，教育流氓分子，都由我们自己干，对不平之事常常发怒，“穷人是一肚子眼泪一肚子愁”，“我是一肚子气”，成了我的口头语。怕群众“失败”，想自己“挽救”危局。似乎田二庄的一切事情，都靠我们自己才行，不知依靠群众，结果“费力不讨好”。干部抵抗大，贫雇孤立，自己也担心坏人打黑枪。干部与地主结合，借着打击流氓杨生，向贫雇大举反攻，使贫雇情绪遭到很大损失。从此教训了我们，自己是渺小的，不行的，惟有发动群众自觉自动的起来，去批评干部，教育流氓分子，向不平的事发怒，那时——只有那时才有力量，干部才能低头，流氓才能改造，不平之事才能消除，群众才能真正翻身，真正当家。
    以上是半月以来所遇到的问题，这些问题不解决，没有这一条最低限度的群众观念——相信群众的观念，单纯讲接近群众的方法方式，是不可能与群众接近的，甚至要脱离群众的。反之，相信群众一分，即能与群众密切一分，方法亦就可以多一条。（更生、韩冰、李珏）
