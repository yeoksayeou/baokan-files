【Taihang News】 Bad cadres such as the Director of the Armed Committee of Wuqiao Village in the Second District of Licheng County, organized a fake poor peasant league, sabotaging the unity of the poor and middle peasants, in an attempt to cover up their own mistakes.  Li Hetian (deputy director of the Armed Committee), a poor peasant and hired laborer, had just returned from a meeting in the county to study the Land Law when Wang Yuansheng, the director of the Armed Committee, bought him some cigarettes, intending to bribe him and get him to cover up some of the bad things he had done in the past. He also colluded with the political director, the public security director, the chairman of the farmers' association, and Li Xiaojie (a poor peasant and hired laborer who attended the meeting in the county) to form a fake poor peasant league. When organizing it, they did not absorb the real poor peasants and hired laborers, but instead had Li Huiku (a middle peasant), the political director's uncle, participate, suppressing the poor peasants and hired laborers to the point where they did not dare to speak. Wang Yuansheng also saw the news of returning the fruits [of land reform] and, fearing that the masses would reason with him, he preemptively returned home and colluded with his mother to offer some bad land. He also attempted to sabotage the unity of the poor and middle peasants and the Land Law by colluding with the middle peasants. He said to the old middle peasant Fu Wentian: "The Land Law is here! It will be divided equally. Eat quickly, or you won't be able to eat after the division. If you don't eat, you're just preparing it for others." He also said to the middle peasant He Qi: "The mule you are feeding is no longer yours." This frightened the middle peasants. The political director, the director of the Armed Committee, the public security director, and the chairman of the farmers' association also used family relationships to divide the unity of the poor peasants. Later, Wang Songling, a cadre from the county, came to the village, disbanded the fake poor peasant league, and found the real poor peasants and hired laborers Li Futian and Shuda's mother, separately communicating with them to convene poor peasant and hired laborer meetings to discuss the Land Law.

    仵桥村干部错上加错
    搞假贫农团破坏土地法
    【太行消息】黎城二区仵桥村武委会主任等坏干部，组织假贫农团，破坏贫中农团结，企图掩盖自己的过错。贫雇李河田（武委会副主任）在县里开会研究土地法刚回来，武委会主任王远生就给他买了些纸烟，打算收买他，想叫把他自己过去办的坏事包庇住些。他并拉拢了政治主任、公安主任、农会主席和李孝节（在县开会的贫雇）等，组织假贫农团。在组织时，不把真正贫雇吸收进来，反叫政治主任的叔叔李会库（中农）参加了，把贫雇农打击的连话也不敢说。王远生又看见退果实消息，怕群众和他讲理，就投机先回家和他娘说通，献些坏地。他还企图破坏贫中农团结，破坏土地法，拉拢中农和自己一气。他给旧中农傅文田说：“土地法下来啦！要平分哩，你快吃吧，分了就吃不开啦，不吃还不是给人家预备哩。”又给中农贺旗说：“你喂的骡子不是你的了。”弄得中农都害了怕。政治主任、武委会主任、公安主任、农会主席，也利用家族关系，分裂贫农团结。后来县里干部王松令到村后，将假贫农团解散，并找到了真正贫雇李甫田、树达娘二人，分别串通召开贫雇会，讨论土地法。
