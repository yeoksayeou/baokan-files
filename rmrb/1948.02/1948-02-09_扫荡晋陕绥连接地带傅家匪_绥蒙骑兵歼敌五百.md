Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. A Suiyuan-Mongolian front-line reporter reports: In mid-January, the Suiyuan-Mongolian People's Liberation Army cavalry units crossed the Yellow River to sweep up the bandits of Fu Zhu Wumei and the Mongolian bandits of Qi Zhizhong in the border area of the three provinces of Jin (Shanxi), Shaanxi, and Sui (Suiyuan) (i.e., the Fugu area of northern Shaanxi, the Hequ area of Shanxi, and the Jungar Banner area of Suiyuan). More than 500 enemies have been annihilated and vast areas liberated. The sweeping up of the remaining bandits continues. Wherever our army goes, it opens granaries to relieve the poor. After fighting a battle, a certain company rested in a village and intercepted more than 60 items of clothing and bedding from fleeing landlords in a village in Hequ, which were distributed according to the degree of poverty. Our political workers often conduct investigations along the way in front of the team to identify Chiang Kai-shek's warehouses and reactionary landlords and evil gentry, and carry many clothes on their saddles, distributing them wherever they encounter impoverished masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. A Suiyuan-Mongolian front-line reporter reports on the situation after the liberation of Shaliang Town in Fugu, stating: Shaliang Town was originally a commercial thoroughfare between the mainland and the Ikezhao League. In the past, the market was prosperous, with more than 20 wineries and oil mills. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was exploited by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and after the Japanese surrender, it was ravaged by the Mongolian bandits of Qi Zhizhong's troops. It has been completely changed, with broken walls and rubble all over the streets. Only a few dying beggars huddled under the eaves show that this is a town where humans have not yet become extinct. Liu Jiuwei, a farm laborer's adopted daughter, sat cross-legged on the street, disheveled and unkempt, without any color in her face. Liu Zhenzi, wrapped in a rag, with a pale face and dull eyes, squatted in a street corner, helplessly enduring the severe cold and hunger. Wang Erhai, a farm laborer, was nearly seventy years old and unable to move. His youngest son fled, and his eldest son was unable to support the whole family by digging coal. Last November, Erhai starved to death. The old man Yang Yuzhen also starved to death on the street. When our cavalry soldiers saw this tragic scene, they jumped off their horses and took off their leather coats to put on the old woman, some wrapped naked babies in their own clothes, and some took out dry food and stuffed it into the hands of the villagers. The political organs of the People's Liberation Army issued the call to "take off clothes to help the poor," and the soldiers responded enthusiastically. A certain company donated 33 items of clothing and sent them to the homes of poor people. Liu Han'er, fifty years old, was so cold that he dared not go out all winter. Now he got a pair of cotton trousers, and he shed tears of gratitude. Our army also distributed a large amount of grain and clothing seized from the enemy to the poor masses. Wang Haijin, a farm laborer in a certain village, and his family of four had not seen millet for several months, and were both hungry and cold. He came from twenty miles away and received a pair of leather pants and a pocket full of rice, thanking the People's Liberation Army incessantly as he walked.

    扫荡晋陕绥连接地带傅家匪
    绥蒙骑兵歼敌五百
    【新华社晋绥七日电】绥蒙前线记者报导：一月中旬绥蒙人民解放军骑兵部队渡过黄河，在晋陕绥三省接壤地带（即陕北之府谷、山西之河曲、绥远之准格尔旗一带），扫荡傅匪朱五美、及蒙匪奇致忠等部，已歼敌五百余人，解放广大地区。刻继续扫荡残匪。我军所到之处，即开仓济贫。某连打完仗后在某村休息，截获了河曲某村逃亡地主衣服被褥六十余件，即按贫苦程度进行发放。我政工人员常在队前分组沿途调查蒋匪仓库及反动地主劣绅，并在马鞍上带着许多衣服，哪里碰到贫苦群众就在哪里发放。
    【新华社晋绥七日电】绥蒙前线记者报导府谷沙梁镇解放后情形称：沙梁镇原为内地及伊克昭盟间之通商要道。昔日市面繁荣，酒坊、油坊达二十余座。抗战期间，经蒋匪压榨，日寇投降后复经蒙匪奇致忠部蹂躏之后，已面目全非，满街断垣残壁，瓦砾遍地。只有几个奄奄待毙的乞丐蜷缩在屋檐下，才显出这是一座人类尚未绝迹的市镇。雇农刘九维的童养媳盘着腿坐在街上，蓬头垢面，毫无人色。刘贞子披着一块破布，脸色灰白，两目无光，双手抱着肩，蹲在街角，无可奈何地忍受着严寒与饥饿。雇农王二海年近古稀，不能动弹。次子逃亡，长子挖炭无法供养全家，去年十一月二海活活饿死。杨愚臻老汉也饿毙街旁。我骑兵战士看见这种惨象，纷纷跳下马来解下自己的皮衣披在老太婆的身上，有的用自己的衣服裹着光屁股的娃娃，有的掏出干粮塞在老乡手里。解放军政治机关发出“解衣济贫”的号召，战士们热烈响应，某连捐出三十三件衣服，送到贫苦人民家里。五十岁的刘憨儿，冻得一冬不敢出门，现在得到一件棉裤，他感激得流出眼泪，我军并将缴获敌人的大批粮食、衣服全部发放给贫苦群众。某村雇农王海金一家四口，几个月不见小米了，又饿又冻，他从二十里外赶来，领到一件皮裤和满口袋米，一边走一边不停的感谢解放军。
