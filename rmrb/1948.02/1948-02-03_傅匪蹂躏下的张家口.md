Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 25th: Zhangjiakou Dispatch: In Zhangyuan, which is under the savagery of Bandit Fu, the numerous and exorbitant taxes are suffocating the people. Ordinary taxes include public grain, purchased grain, pillbox donations, household donations, business donations, etc. The business donation involves extorting mules and horses from merchants, with first-class merchants required to provide 20, middle-class 15, and lower-class at least 5. If one less mule or horse is handed over, a substitute payment of 6 million Jiaozi currency is required. The Wang Sheng Tai firm was once forced to hand over ten mules and horses each. Bicycles and rickshaws must pay a road tax of 100,000 Jiaozi currency per month. Vehicles, regardless of size, must pay a road tax of 50,000 Jiaozi currency as soon as they leave the suburbs. Pedestrians must also pay 500 Jiaozi currency to buy an exit permit, otherwise, it is impossible to move an inch. Residents have to pay 17,000 Jiaozi currency when they receive their ID cards. Small traders, whether on the street or in the open-air market, must pay a landing tax. Bandit Fu has a special agency in the open-air market, and they hold a meter stick to measure the ground occupied by the vendors and set the amount of the landing tax. Those without a license must pay 10,000 Jiaozi currency per day, porters pay 8,000 Jiaozi currency, and even those selling cigarettes retail must pay 5,000 Jiaozi currency. Moving to another location requires another payment. Under the ravages and extortion of Bandit Fu, prices are rising daily, and the citizens are suffering greatly and are eager to be liberated as soon as possible. A folk song is now popular among the citizens: "Chiang Kai-shek is damned, Fu Nitou (referring to Fu Zuoyi as a tortoise), oppresses us so we really can't bear it. Afraid of being drafted, we run to the Eighth Route Army."

    傅匪蹂躏下的张家口
    【新华社晋察冀二十五日电】张家口讯：傅匪蹂躏下的张垣捐税繁多奇重，压得老百姓喘不过气来。平常捐税计有公粮、购买粮、炮楼捐、门户捐、商户捐等等。商户捐是向商人勒征骡马，头等商户二十头，中等十五头，下等至少五头。如少交一头则须缴纳代金蒋币六百万元。王生泰商号一次即被迫交出骡马各十头。自行车和人力车每月要纳马路税十万元。车辆不论大小一驶出郊外，即须缴马路税五万元。行人走路也得出五百元买一张出门证，否则寸步难行。居民领身份证时要交一万七千元。做小买卖的不论在街上或露天市场，都要缴纳落地税，傅匪在露天市场专门设有机关，他们手持米达尺，测量摊贩所占地面，订出落地税额，没牌子的每天要交一万元，挑担的交八千元，零卖纸烟的也得交五千元。转移一个地方，就要另外缴纳一次。在傅匪蹂躏榨取下，物价日日增涨，市民痛苦不堪，均渴望能早日得到解放。市民间现流行着：“蒋该死，傅泥头（指傅作义为王八），压得我们实难受。怕抓兵，就往八路军里跑”的歌谣。
