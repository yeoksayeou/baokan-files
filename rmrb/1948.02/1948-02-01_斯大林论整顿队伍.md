Some people believe that as long as the correct line of the Party is laid down, announced to everyone, described in the form of general outlines and resolutions, and unanimously adopted, it is enough for victory to come automatically, so-called spontaneously. This is, of course, incorrect. This is a huge misconception. Only incorrigible bureaucrats can think this way. In fact, these achievements and victories did not come spontaneously, but were obtained in a fierce struggle to implement the Party's line. Victory never comes on its own—it is usually won through people's struggles. Good resolutions and declarations supporting the Party's general line are only the beginning because they can only express the desire to achieve victory, not the victory itself. After the correct line has been put forward and the correct solution to the problem has been proposed, whether things are effective depends on organizational work, on the organizational struggle to implement the Party's line, on the correct selection of personnel, and on reviewing the implementation of decisions by leading organs. Without this, the Party's correct resolutions risk suffering significant losses. Moreover, after a correct political line has been established, organizational work determines everything, including the fate of the political line itself—its implementation or failure. In fact, the reason we have achieved and obtained victories is that we have carried out a systematic and fierce struggle against the various difficulties in implementing the Party's line, because we have overcome these difficulties, mobilized the Party and the working class to overcome difficulties, organized the struggle to overcome difficulties, replaced unsuitable personnel, and selected excellent personnel capable of fighting against difficulties…

Regarding the removal of incorrigible bureaucrats and red-tape merchants, we have no disagreements. Besides these people, we also have two types of personnel who hinder our work, obstruct our work, and prevent us from moving forward.

The first type of personnel are those who had considerable merit in the past, those who have become veterans, and who believe that the laws of the Party and the Soviets are not written for them, but for those fools. This is the kind of person who does not consider it their responsibility to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government, thereby undermining the foundation of Party and state discipline. They dare to violate Party and Soviet laws. What do they expect? They hope that the Soviet regime will not dare to touch them because of their past merits. These arrogant veterans believe that they are irreplaceable and can violate the decisions of leading organs with impunity. What should be done with such personnel? They should be removed from their leading positions without hesitation, regardless of their past merits (Shouts: Right!), they should be transferred, demoted, and this matter should be announced in the newspapers (Shouts: Right!). This is necessary to knock down the arrogant habits of these conceited veteran bureaucrats and settle them in their proper places. This is necessary to consolidate Party and Soviet discipline in our entire work (Shouts: Right! Applause).

Now I will talk about the second type of personnel, I am referring to those who are empty talkers. I can say that these sincere empty talkers (laughter) are sincere and loyal to the Soviet regime; but they lack the ability to lead, lack the ability to organize anything.

How should we deal with these incorrigible empty talkers? If they are left in action-oriented work, they can sink any lively matter in a flood of endless empty talk. Obviously, they should be removed from leading positions and asked to do other work that is not action-oriented. Empty talkers are not qualified to do action-oriented work (Shouts: Right! Applause). (Stalin: "Report to the 17th Congress of the CPSU")

Reviewing the work of personnel, reviewing the implementation of work instructions—what does this mean? Reviewing the work of personnel means not reviewing them based on their promises and declarations, but based on the results of their work. Reviewing the implementation of work instructions means not only reviewing them in the office, not only reviewing them according to their formal work reports, but primarily reviewing them in the workplace, based on actual results. Generally speaking, is such a review necessary? It is absolutely necessary. It is necessary first because only by implementing such a review can we thoroughly understand personnel and ascertain their true qualities. It is necessary second because only by implementing such a review can we ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of the implementing organs. It is necessary third because only by implementing such a review can we ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of the work instructions themselves. Some comrades believe that the review of personnel can only be carried out from top to bottom, that is, leaders review their subordinates based on their work. This idea is incorrect. Review from top to bottom is certainly necessary, because it is an effective way to review personnel and review the implementation of work instructions; but in addition to review from top to bottom, there is another review method, namely review from bottom to top, that is, the masses, the subordinates, review the leaders, point out their mistakes, and point out ways to correct these mistakes. This kind of review is one of the most effective ways to review personnel. (Stalin: "On the Shortcomings of Party Work")

The entire work of the Party—especially if the Social Democratic traditions in the Party have not yet been eradicated—must be transformed and built on a new revolutionary pace, so that every step and every action of the Party naturally leads to revolutionizing the masses, to cultivating and educating the broad masses of the working class in the spirit of revolution.

The Party must not conceal its mistakes, must not be afraid of criticism, but must be good at improving and educating its cadres in its own mistakes.

The Party must be good at selecting the best elements from among the advanced fighters to the basic leading core, these outstanding elements are extremely loyal, sufficient to become the true expression of the intentions of the revolutionary proletariat, and they are extremely experienced, sufficient to become the true leaders of the proletarian revolution, leaders who are good at using the tactics and strategies of Leninism.

The Party must constantly improve its social composition, eliminate those opportunists who corrupt the Party, in order to achieve the highest degree of unity.

The Party must establish iron proletarian discipline, which is based on ideological consistency, clarity of the goals of the movement, unity of practical action, and the conscious attitude of the broad Party masses towards the Party's tasks. (Stalin on the Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh of the Twelve Conditions for the Bolshevization of the Party)

    斯大林论整顿队伍
    有些人认为：只要规定党的正确路线，向大家宣布它，用一般的提纲和决议的形式来叙述它并一致通过它，就足以使胜利自行来到，所谓自流式地来到。这当然是不正确的。这是一个很大的迷误。只有不可救药的官僚主义者才能这样想。事实上，这些成绩和胜利不是自流来到的，而是在为实行党的路线而作的残酷斗争中得到的。无论什么时候，胜利都不是自行来到的，——它通常是由人们奋斗得来的。拥护党的总路线的良好决议案和宣言，——这只是事情的开端，因为他们只能表示取得胜利的愿望，而不能表示胜利本身。在正确的路线已经提出以后，在问题的正确决定已被提出以后，事情是否收成效，这就有赖于组织的工作，有赖于组织斗争去实行党的路线，有赖于正确的挑选人材，有赖于审查领导机关决议的执行程度。没有这一层，党的正确决议就有遭受重大损失的危险。而且，在正确的政治路线定出以后，组织工作便决定一切，就中也决定政治路线本身的命运——政治路线的实行或者政治路线的失败。事实上，我们之所以达到了和获得了胜利，是因为我们与那些摆在执行党路线上的各种困难进行了有系统的和残酷的斗争，是因为我们克服了这些困难，发动了党和工人阶级去克服困难，组织了斗争去克服困难，撤换了不适用的工作人员，并挑选了优秀的、有能力来与困难作斗争的工作人员………
    撤销不可救药的官僚主义者和文牍主义者，对于这件事情，我们没有任何分歧的意见。除了这班人以外，我们还有两种工作人员，这两种工作人员，阻碍我们的工作，妨碍我们的工作，不让我们前进。
    第一种工作人员，这种人过去有相当的功绩，这种人已成为功臣，他们以为党和苏维埃的法律，并不是为他们而写的，而是为了那些傻子们写的。这就是这样的一种人，这种人并不认为执行党的、政府的决议，是他们自己的责任，这样他们就破坏党的、国家的纪律基础。他们敢于破坏党和苏维埃的法律。他们所指望的是什么呢？他们希望着：以为苏维埃政权因为他们过去的功绩而不敢去惊动他们。这些自负的功臣，认为他们是无人可以替代的，他们可以破坏领导机关的决议而不受处分。对于这种工作人员，怎么办呢？应当毫不犹豫地撤换他们的领导职务，不顾他们过去的功绩（喊声：对呀！），应当调动他们、降低他们的职位，并把这件事情在报纸上公布（喊声：对呀！）。这件事情之所以必要，为的是要打下这些自负的功臣官僚的傲慢习气，并把他们安顿在应得的位置上。这件事情之所以必要，为的是要在我们的整个工作中，巩固党的和苏维埃的纪律（喊声：对呀！鼓掌）。
    现在讲到第二种工作人员，我所指的是一种说空话的人。我可以说：这些诚恳的说空话的人（笑声），是诚恳的，是忠于苏维埃政权的人；但是没有能力来领导，没有能力来组织什么事情。
    怎样对付这些不可救药的说空话的人呢？如果把他们留在行动工作上面，他们能够把任何一件活泼泼的事情沉没在滔滔不绝的空话的洪水里面。很明显的，应当把他们从领导的地位上撤销，叫他们去做其他的不是行动的工作。说空话的人是没有做行动工作的资格的（喊声：对呀！鼓掌）。（斯大林：“在联共第十七次大会上的报告”）
    审查工作人员，审查工作指示之执行情形，——这是什么意思呢？审查工作人员，这就是说，不是以工作人员之允诺和宣言为标准，而是以他们的工作结果为标准，来加以审查，审查工作指示之执行情形，这就是说，不仅是在办公室，不仅是按他们的形式上的工作报告来审查，而首先是在工作地方，按实际的结果来审查。一般说来，是否需要这样的审查呢？是绝对需要的。其所以需要，第一就是因为只有实行这样的审查，才可以透彻无遗地认识工作人员，查明他们的真正品质。其所以需要，第二就是因为只有实行这样的审查，才可以查明执行机关之优点和缺点。其所以需要，第三就是因为只有实行这样的审查，才可以查明该工作指示本身之优点和缺点。有些同志认为，对于工作人员的审查，只可以从上而下来实行，就是领导者根据被领导者之工作情形来审查被领导者。这种想法是不对的，从上而下来审查当然是需要的，因为这是审查工作人员及审查工作指示执行情形的有效办法之一；可是除从上而下的审查以外，还有另外一种审查方法，即从下而上的审查，就是说，由群众、由被领导者来审查领导者，指出他们的错误，并指明改正这些错误之办法。这种审查，乃是最有效的审查工作人员的办法之一。（斯大林：“论党的工作之缺点”）
    必须使得党的全部工作——特别若是党里的社会民主党传统还未灭绝的话——改造过，来建筑在新的革命的步调上，它使得党的每一步骤和每一行动，自然而然地走向使群众革命化，走向在革命的精神上，培养和教育工人阶级的广大群众。
    必须使得党不掩饰自己的错误，不怕批评，而要善于在自己的错误改进和教育自己的干部。
    必须使得党善于把先进战斗员中底优秀分子选拔到基本的领导核心去，这些优秀分子是十分忠实的，足以成为革命无产阶级之意向的真正的表达者，并且他们是十分有经验的，足以成为无产阶级革命的真正领袖，善于运用列宁主义的策略和战略的领袖。
    必须使得党经常改善自己的社会成份，清除那些腐化党的机会主义分子，以便达到最高限度的一元性。
    必须使得党创立起铁的无产阶级的纪律，这种纪律是基于思想的一致性、运动之目的之明确性，实际行动的统一性，及广大党内群众对党的任务之自觉态度而成长起来的。（斯大林论党的布尔塞维克化十二条中第五、八、九、十、十一五条）
