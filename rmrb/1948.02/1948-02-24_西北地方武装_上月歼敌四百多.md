Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th: The Northwest Joint Defense Headquarters announced the battle achievements of the border region's local armed forces in January as follows: A total of 240 enemies were killed or wounded, 220 enemies were captured, totaling 460 enemies annihilated, and another 11 defected. On January 21, a guerrilla unit in Anse besieged Shiyao (15 li north of Yan'an city), the location of the puppet Anse County government, drove away the puppet county government, and captured two enemies. From January 19 to 21, a company of a detachment in Yan County ambushed the enemy who went out to loot grain three times, wounding 16 enemies including the battalion commander and killing four enemies. Two units of the local armed forces in the Guanzhong sub-district crossed the Jing River to the south at the end of last year to attack the enemy area. In the battle of Nanmaling (under the jurisdiction of Liquan County) on January 20, 18 enemies were captured and 18 rifles were seized, with no casualties on our side. On New Year's Day evening, the local armed forces of our Sanbian sub-district raided Ningtiaoliang, the驻地 (zhùdì, stationed location) of the bandit Zhao Huanzhang's unit, and captured 12 enemies. On the 5th, our Ganquan guerrilla unit ambushed and destroyed an enemy vehicle at Yushugou, Laoshan, killing the enemy gendarmerie company commander and four others. Another dispatch: The Hu bandits entrenched in Yan'an, in order to make up for the shortage of troops, incorporated the Yan'an Thirty Mile Shop Baojing (security patrol) team into the enemy's regular army, but they all ran away within two months. Some defected to us with weapons. Recently, the Hu bandits incorporated the Baojing team of Yan Guozong into the Twelfth Brigade, and the soldiers are also deserting in increasing numbers. Chiang bandit officers and their families, fearing the counter-offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, are rushing to buy gold and fleeing south in droves.
