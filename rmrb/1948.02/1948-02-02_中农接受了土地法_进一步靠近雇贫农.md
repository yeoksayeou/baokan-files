    Middle Peasants Accept the Land Law, Further Approaching Poor and Hired Peasants
    [Huguang News] After ten days of publicizing the Land Law Outline in the sixth district of Huguan, middle peasants understood the law's benefits to them, and moved closer to the poor and hired peasants. For example, Li Yuanqing (former middle peasant) of Shuzhang Village said: "How many landlords and rich peasants are there? There are more poor people. In the past, the landlords ignored us, but now the poor and hired peasants help us with everything. Before the Land Law came out, I thought that once the rich were gone, it would be our turn, the middle peasants, to be struggled against. Now that the Land Law is promulgated, I feel much more at ease." Li Nianyang said: "Last year, I herded four or five livestock (belonging to the collective) and farmed fifteen mu of land. I am neither rich nor poor. Every day I sell coal and deliver goods. I am always with you poor folks. Middle peasants and poor peasants can talk to each other, and each has the other in mind. We are all suffering people." Suo Hai said: "That bunch (landlords and rich peasants) can't see us, and we don't like the sight of them either." Then Feng Xiaonian said: "Finding poor people can help us, what would a landlord do for us? If we rely on the poor and hired peasants, we can do anything. We are all in this together. Landlords rely on money to eat, we rely on strength. Middle and poor peasants are closer, middle and poor peasants are more like family. We dare not speak loudly in the homes of landlords, but we are full of energy in the homes of laborers (hired workers)!" Yuanqing added: "In the past, if we were to team up, it would be we middle and poor peasants teaming up. We wouldn't team up with the landlords. Now that mutual aid is popular, it is still us middle and poor peasants working together." Feng Yuansuo and Zhao Xiqun said: "Hoeing and herding livestock are all done by us middle and poor peasants. We must be of one mind with the basic masses. My child is in the Eighth Route Army, how could I be of one mind with those landlords and rich peasants!" Yuansuo said: "I have suffered at the hands of the landlords in the past and have long wanted to get back at them. If it weren't for the basic masses struggling against them, I would never achieve my goal. In the past, when we worked for the landlords, we always spoke to the old farmhands! Even to get a farm tool, we had to find the old farmhands to get it done. It wouldn't work to find the landlord."

    中农接受了土地法  进一步靠近雇贫农
    【壶关消息】土地法大纲公布后，壶关六区进行了十天的宣传，中农了解了土地法对自己的利益，更加挨近了贫雇农。如树掌村李元青（旧中农）说：“地主老财可有几家？那里也是贫的多，过去地主就不理咱，现在贫雇农有什么也帮助咱。土地法没下来时，我想着老财没有了，该着斗咱中农了。土地法一公布，我心里倒稳了”。李年羊说：“去年赶的四五个牲口（大家的），种的十五亩地，咱是不上不下，每天就是卖煤送脚，时常是给咱这伙穷人在一处。中农和贫农谁也和谁说得着，谁眼里也有谁，咱都是受苦的人”。锁孩说：“那一伙子（地主富农），看不见咱们，咱看见他也不顺眼”。接着冯小年说：“找上贫人，能给咱帮忙，找地主会给咱干什么？咱靠住贫雇农什也能干，咱就是这一伙子，地主是靠钱吃，咱们是靠力量，近也是中贫农近，亲也是中贫农亲，咱去地主住的家不敢吭声，到你把作（雇工）家可有劲哩！”元青又说：“过去是搭帮就是咱中贫农搭帮，也给地主搭帮不上。现在兴了互助还是咱中贫农在一起。”冯元锁、赵喜群说：“捉镢赶牲口都是咱中贫农，非给基本人一心不行，我孩在八路军里哩，还能给他们地主富农一心！”元锁说：“我过去吃地主的亏，早就想整他，要不是基本人斗他，咱一辈子也达不到目的。咱过去给地主作生活，也是给老庄稼说着喽！就要个农具家伙，也是找着老庄稼才能办事，找见地主就不行”。
