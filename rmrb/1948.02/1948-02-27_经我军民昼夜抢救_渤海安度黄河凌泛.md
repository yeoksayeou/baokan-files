　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th: The Bohai area's Yellow River ice flood, which began on the 7th of this month, has been turned from danger to safety by the 13th after active rescue efforts. For nearly a week, all party, government, military, men, women, old and young along the river were mobilized to rescue day and night. At the most critical moment, the military region commander personally led the artillery and military industrial blasting team to break the ice with heavy artillery and explosions. Staff members of the Provincial River Affairs Bureau sailed boats to rescue the masses and led them to break the ice and dredge the water. The masses also used their own bedding and straw to block the breaches in the dam. In the two-mile section at the junction of Putai and Lijin alone, the materials used were worth more than 810,000 North Sea currency (each yuan equivalent to 25 yuan of Chiang currency). Now the ice has melted and the river is flowing into the sea, and the danger has passed.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: On the 7th of this month, the returning Yellow River's ice flood suddenly arrived, with torrents and ice piles like mountains, and washed down a large ice block of one square li. By the 11th, the water level had risen to 18.04 meters, which was 1.09 meters higher than the highest water level of 16.95 meters during last year's flood season. The whirlpool expanded, and breaches occurred in the river embankment, making the situation critical. The water depth around the city wall of Putai, which is twelve li away from the riverbed, submerged the top. The Hetao area and Chengguan area of Putai, Dongguan and other villages of Lijin, and more than 70 villages along the river in Bin County, Gaoyuan, Huimin, and Qingcheng were flooded because the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and Chiang Kai-shek bandits withheld the resettlement funds last year and failed to relocate them in time. Residents suffered heavy losses. Now the democratic government is actively carrying out rescue operations, and the disaster victims have all been rescued and are being resettled and relieved.

　　经我军民昼夜抢救
  　渤海安度黄河凌泛
    【新华社华东二十五日电】渤海区黄河凌泛泛滥，自本月七日起，经积极抢救，迄十三日已转危为安。在将近一周间，沿河党政军民男女老幼全部出动昼夜抢险，情况最紧张时，军区司令员亲率炮兵及军工爆炸队，用重炮和爆炸破冰，省河务局工作人员则驾船一面抢救群众，一面率领群众破冰疏水。群众并纷纷以自己被服草秸等堵塞大堤漏洞，仅蒲台、利津交界处两里的地段，所用即值北海币八十一万余元（每元合蒋币二十五元），现冰解河开，大水奔腾入海，危险已过。
    【新华社华东二十四日电】本月七日，归故黄河凌泛突来，激流奔腾，积冰如山，并冲下一方里大的冰块。至十一日水位涨达一八·零四公尺，较去年伏泛最高水位一六·九五公尺，尚高出一·零九公尺。水涡扩大，河堤发生漏洞，形势危急，距河床十二里的蒲台城垣周围水深没顶。蒲台之河套区、城关区、利津之东关等村及滨县、高苑、惠民、青城境内沿河七十余村庄，因去年联总及蒋匪扣拨移民费，未得及时迁移，均惨遭水淹。居民损失重大，现民主政府正积极抢险中，灾民也已全部救出，并正分别安置和救济中。
