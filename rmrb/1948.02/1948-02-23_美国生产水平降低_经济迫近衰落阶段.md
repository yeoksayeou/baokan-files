Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: TASS, New York, February 19th: The continuous decline in prices confirms a widespread opinion: The U.S. economy, even if it has not yet entered a stage of recession, is approaching one. On February 18th, wholesale prices overall were slightly lower than on the 17th. Compared to February 3rd, wheat prices fell 51 cents per bushel, corn 38 cents, oats 13 cents, cotton more than $2 per bale, and pigs $2.50 per "shengdingna" (note: one shengdingna is equivalent to 100 Chinese catties) each. Farmers in Kansas alone lost $1 million due to falling prices. Figures from major U.S. industries show a decline in production levels. The Federal Reserve Board's latest index confirms some reductions in production in December of last year. Weekly indices published by various non-official agencies indicate that production continued to decrease throughout January and early February. The New York Times' weekly index of business activity showed a decline for the second consecutive week. The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on the evening of February 18th that new orders for both major equipment and consumer goods had decreased significantly. The index of new orders in December fell from 267 in November to 252. The latest statistics show a significant decline in retail trade. The reduction in new orders and retail trade volume, as well as the tightening of credit, has accelerated bankruptcies. 631 companies have gone bankrupt this year, compared to 342 in the same period last year. According to the Commercial Daily, the number of company bankruptcies last week reached its highest peak since January 19, 1943. It is generally believed that even if the Marshall Plan is implemented, foreign markets will play a smaller role in supporting the U.S. economy than they did last year. Bryce N. Harlow, an official representative of the Department of Commerce, wrote in the Commercial Daily, estimating that U.S. exports this year, even with the Marshall Plan, would still decrease by about 10% compared to last year. "U.S. News," a business publication of the U.S. business community, predicts that prices will fall by about 20%, production will decrease by at least 20%, and unemployment will increase accordingly.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Reports from various sources: The people of the United States and Canada express indifference and distrust towards the "Marshall Plan." According to the United Press report, State Department officials revealed that of the 5,000 letters they receive each week inquiring about foreign policy, only 200 are about the "Marshall Plan," accounting for only 4% of all letters. Therefore, the official had to "reluctantly" admit that "society is indifferent." The American people's indifference to the Marshall Plan "is due to the fact that they are more concerned about the sharp drop in prices than about the State Department's 'foreign aid' documents" (TASS, February 14th). Meanwhile, the Washington dispatch of the London Daily Telegraph stated that the U.S. administrative officials in charge of the "Marshall Plan" are becoming increasingly annoyed by the indifference shown by Americans towards the implementation of the "aid to Europe" plan. According to the Canadian Financial Post, 80 out of 100 Canadians do not believe that the Marshall Plan can be realized. The Ottawa Journal also stated in its editorial: "The Marshall Plan" is gradually weakening, and no one knows what it will eventually become. The newspaper urged that "no hope" be placed on the "plan."

　　美国生产水平降低  经济迫近衰落阶段
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】塔斯社纽约十九日电：物价继续不断的跌落，证实了一个普遍的意见：美国经济即使不是已进入衰落阶段，也是正迫近衰落阶段。二月十八日，批发价格整个说来较十七日稍低。与二月三日相比较，小麦价格每蒲式尔下跌五角一分，玉蜀黍三角八分，燕麦一角三分，棉花每包下跌二元多，猪每生丁纳（按：每生丁纳合我国一百市斤）下跌二元半。仅堪萨斯州一州的农民，即因物价下跌损失一百万美元。美国主要工业的数字，显示生产水平的降落。联邦准备局的最新指数，证实了去年十二月生产有某些削减。各种非官方机关发表的每周指数，说明了一月份全月和二月初生产仍在继续减少中。纽约时报所发表的每周企业活动指数，表示了连续第二周的下降。美商务部二月十八日晚宣布：主要装备和消费品的新定单均有很大减少。十二月份新定单指数由十一月的二六七减少至二五二，最新的统计数字显示零售贸易有显著下跌。新定单和零售贸易数量的减少以及信用的紧缩，加速了破产。今年内已有六三一家公司破产，而去年同一时期内破产公司为三四二家。据商务日报称，公司破产的数目上周已达到一九四三年一月十九日以来的最高峰。一般认为：即使马歇尔计划实现，国外市场在支持美国经济的作用上，亦将较去年为小。商务部官方代表布莱斯德尔在商务日报上著文，估计美国今年的输出，即使有马歇尔计划，仍将较去年减少约百分之十。美国企业界机关报"美国新闻"预料价格将下落约百分之二十，生产减少最少百分之二十，同时失业也将随之增加。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：美、加人民对"马歇尔计划"表示冷淡和不信任。据合众社报导：国务院官员透露：该院每周收到五千封询问外交政策的信中，只有二百封是关于"马歇尔计划"的，仅占全部信件百分之四。因此该官员不得不"勉强"承认说："社会上表示冷淡"。美人民对马歇尔计划冷淡，"其原因是他们对物价的猛跌比对国务院'援外'的文件关切得多"（塔斯社十四日电）。同时，伦敦每日电讯报华府消息称：掌管"马歇尔计划"的美行政官员，越来越因为美人对实行"援欧"计划所表现的冷淡，而日益烦恼"。另据加拿大财政邮报载称：加国一百人中有八十人不相信马歇尔计划能实现。渥太华日报在其专论中亦称："马歇尔计划"日渐衰萎，谁也不知道它最后会变成什么，该报敦促对该"计划""不要存任何希望"。
