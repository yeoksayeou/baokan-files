Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: Reports from the Jiaodong guerrilla warfare front: (1) In January, local armed forces in the outer areas of Yantai initiated 66 battles, both proactive attacks and strikes against bandits and puppet troops who were looting grain. They killed or wounded 470 enemy soldiers, captured 120 alive, and also killed, wounded, or captured 164 members of the "Returning Home Corps." They seized 5 light machine guns, 25 submachine guns, 57 rifles and carbines, and 193 vehicles of various sizes. (2) In the recent half-month from January 20th to February 3rd, the Fushan suburban guerrilla team twice struck at bandits and puppet troops who ventured out from the city to loot, eliminating 301 enemy soldiers and seizing a portion of their weapons. Also, in early January, the Fushan people's armed blasting team detonated 36 landmines under the city walls, killing or wounding 51 enemy soldiers and capturing one. (3) In the outer areas of Longkou, after our army recovered strongholds within 30 li east of the city, such as Huangshangguan, Shangmengjia, Xiaochenjia, Shuangmiao Xujia, and Aoshang, we immediately surrounded Longkou City. We even once attacked the airfield 3 li southeast of the city and the city's electric light company. Although the enemy repeatedly gathered forces to try to rebuild strongholds such as Aoshang, they were all defeated by our army. In the past two months, we have killed or wounded 1,366 enemy soldiers, captured 64, and seized 7 light machine guns, 20 submachine guns and carbines, and 58 rifles and carbines. Under our political offensive, 570 enemy soldiers and members of the "Returning Home Corps" defected to our side. Currently, the enemy in Longkou City is surrounded by our army on the east, south, and west sides, while the Bohai Sea to the north is blocked by thick ice, making supply and transportation extremely difficult, and the situation is becoming increasingly critical.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The Fushan Working Team in Jiaodong, divided into four routes on the 7th and 8th of this month, crossed the enemy's tight blockade and went deep into villages within several li of the suburbs of Yantai City. They crushed the Chiang Kai-shek puppet organizations and other units in 17 villages, including Zhujia Village, capturing the puppet self-defense regiment leader Shen Zhizhang and 150 others alive, and seizing a portion of their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: Local armed forces and militia in the Tai'an area of central Shandong successfully smashed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' "mopping-up" operation between January 10th and 26th. On the 10th of last month, the enemy's 77th Brigade from Tai'an and a regiment of the enemy's 187th Brigade from Laiwu advanced east and west along the Tai-Lai Road, respectively. After converging in Fanjiadian, east of Tai'an, they "mopped up" north of the Tai-Lai Road. They encountered separate resistance and ambushes from our army along the Yangqiu Mountain line, eliminating an enemy company and killing or wounding over 200. At the same time, another unit of our army, coordinating with concentrated firepower, took the opportunity to rush into the 77th Brigade's headquarters in Tangjia Wangxu. The brigade commander fled in panic across the river back to enemy strongholds in Shuibei (northwest of Laicheng) and the Tai'an area. On the 20th and 21st, two regiments of the 112th Brigade and two regiments of the 213th Brigade, advancing from Licheng and Boshan, were also severely attacked by us in Liubu, Hulaoguan, and other places by the 26th, killing or wounding over 100, and forcing them to retreat to their strongholds.
