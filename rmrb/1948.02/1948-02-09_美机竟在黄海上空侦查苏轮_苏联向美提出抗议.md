Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 7th: TASS, Moscow reports: In recent months, U.S. aircraft, including "Flying Fortresses," have circled Soviet merchant ships in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, and even swooped down from above the masts to conduct reconnaissance of the Soviet ships. This blatant attempt by the U.S. authorities to control shipping beyond the territorial waters of the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan is clear evidence of endangering the legitimate interests of other countries' merchant ships. The Soviet government, on January 30th, sent a note to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, protesting to the U.S. government, stating that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that the U.S. government will issue the necessary instructions to the relevant U.S. authorities to ensure that similar incidents of persecuting the freedom of navigation of Soviet ships do not occur again in the future.

    美机竟在黄海上空侦查苏轮
    苏联向美提出抗议
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：近数月来，美国飞机包括“空中堡垒”在内，曾在黄海及日本海上空，盘旋苏联商船四周，甚至飞越至桅杆顶上向苏轮俯冲侦察。美国当局此种妄欲在黄海及日本海领海以外控制航运的露骨企图，乃是危害他国商轮航行合法利益的明证。苏联政府特于上月三十日照会莫斯科美国大使馆，向美国政府提出抗议称：苏联外交部盼望美国政府向有关的美国当局下达必要的训令，保证以后不再发生同样迫害苏轮航行自由之事件。
