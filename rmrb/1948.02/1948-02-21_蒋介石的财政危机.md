　　Chiang Kai-shek's Financial Crisis
    The large-scale counter-offensive by the People's Liberation Army and the further impoverishment, bankruptcy, and starvation of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas under the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek's four big families have created an unprecedented crisis in the Chiang bandit's finances.

    In terms of expenditures, the Chiang bandit's internal currency and grain expenditures, as well as foreign exchange expenditures for purchasing military supplies, have increased sharply.

    In terms of currency expenditures, the Chiang bandit openly announced a full-year budget of over 9.3 trillion yuan for 1947 (this budget was based on the price level of September of the previous year and was deliberately reduced in various ways; if calculated based on the price level of December of the previous year, it should be listed as 30 trillion yuan). However, according to various sources, the actual expenditure last year increased month by month with rising prices, with the total expenditure for the first four months reaching 14 trillion yuan, increasing to 12 trillion yuan in October alone, and further increasing to over 16 trillion yuan in December; based on the above situation, the Chiang bandit's actual currency expenditure for the entire year last year was approximately 100 trillion yuan. Judging from the relationship between the rate of price increases and the increase in financial expenditure in previous years (from 1945 to 1946, Chiang bandit's prices rose by about five times annually, and actual expenditure often exceeded the budget by five times), last year's price increase was more than twelve times, and the Chiang bandit's actual expenditure was at least five times the actual budget, i.e., 150 trillion yuan, exceeding 150 trillion yuan.

    On January 9 this year, the Chiang bandit announced a budget of over 96 trillion Chiang currency for currency expenditure in the first half of 1948. Based on the situation in previous years, the actual expenditure is often about five times the budget, then the Chiang bandit's actual currency expenditure this year will reach the astronomical figure of over 10 quadrillion yuan.

    In terms of grain expenditure: according to the Chiang bandit army's supply standard of 24 taels of rice per person per day, the Chiang bandit's more than 4 million military personnel needed a total of 40 million dan of rice last year. In 1948, due to the Chiang bandit's announcement that, starting from February, each "central" level public employee of the Chiang regime would be allocated 3 dou of rice per month, and technicians and laborers 2 dou of rice, it is estimated that this will increase the expenditure of 5 million to 10 million dan of rice, totaling between 45 million and 50 million dan of rice for the whole year.

    The foreign exchange expenditure for purchasing military supplies: last year alone, the foreign exchange used by the Chiang bandit's Resources Committee exceeded 130 million US dollars, not including the US imperialists and their running dogs, Canada, transferring war materials and loans to purchase military supplies. In 1948, due to the fact that the war materials obtained by the Chiang bandits from the US imperialists and the Japanese army have been largely consumed, their foreign purchasing expenditure will increase rather than decrease.

    In contrast to the increasing expenditure year by year, the actual value of the Chiang bandit's normal income decreases year by year, resulting in an increasing financial deficit.

    The Chiang bandit's budget for last year, including 400 million US dollars of public bonds and treasury bonds, totaled 122 trillion yuan. According to the Chiang bandit's announced actual receipts, tax revenue was 9 trillion, non-tax revenue was over 2.8 trillion, and the sale of US dollar public bonds and treasury bonds was 1.3 trillion, totaling 13 trillion yuan for the whole year, with a currency deficit of about 90 percent.

    The Chiang bandit's budget for currency income in the first half of 1948 was listed as 58 trillion yuan in order to conceal the disparity between income and expenditure, but according to Lou Tongsun, acting secretary-general of the Chiang bandit's Legislative Yuan, on the 7th of this month: it is expected that the actual income will not exceed 60 percent of this number, i.e., 35 trillion yuan. He also revealed that the war expenses and "transportation expenses" and so-called "construction expenses," which account for more than 80 percent of the total expenditure, are all without funding. Based on this estimate, the actual currency income for the whole year is unlikely to reach 100 trillion yuan, and the Chiang bandit's currency deficit this year will exceed 90 percent.

    In terms of grain income, the total amount of grain collected and borrowed in 1947 (including the local level) was 64.77 million dan (according to the Shanghai Dagongbao on December 8 last year, wheat and sorghum have been converted into rice), and the actual collection was only about 70% of the quota. The Chiang bandit central government actually obtained 25.63 million dan of rice, with a grain deficit of more than 30%. This year, the Chiang bandit's quota for collection and borrowing has increased to 80 million dan of rice, and 10 million dan of military grain will be purchased in Sichuan and Hunan. The Chiang bandit central government expects to receive 50 million dan, but as the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas become increasingly bankrupt and resist, and the People's Liberation Army launches a victorious offensive, the Chiang bandit's actual grain collection will be far lower than this number, and the grain deficit will increase even more.

    In terms of foreign payments, in last year's international payment items in the Chiang-controlled areas, the normal trade deficit was over 220 million US dollars; the smuggling deficit was at least 100 million US dollars according to the lowest estimate by the Beijing "Zheng Lun" magazine, which is related to the Chiang bandit's officialdom; repayment of foreign debt principal and interest was 45 million US dollars; the Chiang bandit government's expenses for personnel stationed abroad were approximately 65 million US dollars; and the profits and interest of foreign-owned enterprises in China were at least 50 million US dollars. The above totals over 480 million US dollars. Under the income item, remittances from overseas Chinese have been drastically reduced to less than 50 million US dollars; the expenses of foreigners in the Chiang-controlled areas are approximately 50 million US dollars; and the Chiang bandit's previous sales of surplus US-transferred materials are approximately 100 million US dollars. The total income is less than 200 million US dollars, with a deficit of over 280 million US dollars. Adding the Chiang bandit's foreign war expenses of 130 million US dollars last year, this deficit is further aggravated and increased to over 410 million US dollars. According to the figures released by Zhu Qi, a senior official of the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Finance, the Chiang bandit's monthly international balance of payments deficit last year was 36 million US dollars, then the total deficit for the whole year last year was 432 million US dollars, which is very close to our estimate above. This situation will develop further in 1948.

    The only way for the Chiang bandit to make up for the increasing currency deficit year by year is to exploit the people by issuing banknotes indiscriminately; before the Chinese New Year, the amount of Chiang currency issued has exceeded 100 trillion yuan, which is ten times higher than the amount issued at the end of the previous year. The four big families have made a fortune from inflation and rising prices, turning the sweat and blood of the vast majority of people in the Chiang-controlled areas into the private property of the four big families. This situation has directly caused starvation among the working people in the Chiang-controlled areas and the bankruptcy of national industries. In December last year, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau of the Chiang bandit announced that the workers' cost of living index was only 68,000 times, less than half of the price index for that month. And millions of soldiers and public employees in the Chiang bandit regime have also fallen into a state of starvation. Industrial and commercial enterprises have gone bankrupt and closed down one after another.

    The Chiang bandit's annually increasing grain collection, purchases, requisition and local apportionment is the extra feudal land rent extracted by the Chiang bandit's state monopoly capital group from the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas, thus draining the fat and blood of the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas. The burden on self-cultivating farmers in the Chiang-controlled areas usually reaches 65% to 80%, while tenants, in addition to paying landlords more than 50% of their annual income as rent, usually have to pay 15% to 20% of their annual income as apportionment. In the Chiang-occupied areas of eastern Hebei, northern Henan, and Liaoning, farmers have exhausted all their possessions and still cannot pay the taxes and apportionments of the Chiang bandits. Another result is that agricultural cultivation is becoming increasingly extensive, farmland water conservancy is in disrepair, and more and more land is abandoned (before the Chinese New Year, it had exceeded 50 million mu). As a result, agricultural production in the Chiang-controlled areas has plummeted. In 1947, the rice harvest was 33% lower than in normal pre-war years, the wheat harvest was 40% lower, and other miscellaneous grains such as sorghum and sweet potatoes were reduced by more than 30%. Compared with the minimum demand, the grain production in the Chiang-controlled areas last year before this year's harvest was short of 3 million metric tons of rice (equivalent to 60 million dan) and 2.8 million metric tons of wheat (equivalent to about 56 million dan), foreshadowing a serious famine threatening the survival of millions of people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The people's movements of resisting grain, resisting conscription, and begging for food in the Chiang-controlled areas will develop more widely on this basis.

    Finally, due to the development of the Chiang bandit's foreign payment deficit and international balance of payments deficit, a crisis of foreign exchange exhaustion has been created for the Chiang bandit. The Chiang bandit is even more unconditionally relying on the US imperialist's blood transfusion and is even more recklessly selling out national sovereignty. Currently, the Chiang bandit is begging his Wall Street masters for loans to save his life through the compradors and traitors Kong Xiangxi and Bei Zuyi, but the facts of the past two years have proved that US imperialist aid cannot save Chiang Kai-shek, who is increasingly sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire.

　　蒋介石的财政危机
    由于人民解放军大举反攻以及蒋匪四大家族压榨下蒋区人民进一步贫困、破产、饥饿的发展，就造成了目前蒋匪财政前所未见的危机。
    在岁出部门中，蒋匪对内的货币支出和粮食支出，以及对外购买军火的外币支出，均急剧膨胀。
    货币支出方面，一九四七年度蒋匪公开宣布的全年预算为九万三千余亿元（该项预算是以前年九月物价为准且故意多方削减而做出的，如以前年十二月物价水准来计算，应列为三十万亿元）。但据各消息透露去年实际支出：随着物价上涨逐月增加，头四个月的支出共达十四万亿元，十月份一个月已增为十二万亿元，十二月份更增为十六万亿元以上；根据上述情形统计，去年全年蒋匪货币实支约为一百万亿元左右。若从历年物价上涨速度与财政支出增加的关系来看（一九四五至四六年蒋匪物价每年上涨五倍上下，而实支常超过岁出预算五倍），去年度物价上涨为十二倍以上，蒋匪实支至少为实际预算即上述三十万亿元之五倍，即超过一百五十万亿元。
    蒋匪于今年一月九日公布一九四八年上半年货币支出预算为蒋币九十六万余亿元，根据历年情况，实支常超出岁出预算五倍左右计，那么今年蒋匪货币实支将达一千万亿元以上之天文学数字。
    粮食支出方面：按蒋匪军队供给标准每人每天二十四两大米计算，蒋匪军事人员四百多万，去年一年共需稻谷四千万担。一九四八年，由于蒋匪宣布自二月份起，配给蒋政权“中央”级公教人员每人每月三斗米，技工及工役二斗米，估计将增加五百万至一千万担稻谷的支出，合计全年稻谷支出共需四千五百万到五千万担之间。
    购买军火的外币支出，去年一年仅蒋匪资源委员会所用外汇即超过一亿三千万元，美帝及其走狗加拿大移让作战物资及贷款购买军火数字尚不在内。一九四八年，由于蒋匪得自美帝及日军的作战物资已消耗大部，其对外购买支出将有增无减。
    与支出逐年膨胀情形相反，蒋匪正常收入实值则逐年减少，其结果就造成了财政赤字日益增大。
    蒋匪去年岁入预算连四亿元美金公债及库券在内，合计十二万二千亿元。据蒋匪宣布实收情形，税收九万亿，税外收入二万八千余亿，出卖美金公债库券一万三千亿，合计全年实收为十三万亿元，货币赤字约达百分之九十左右。
    蒋匪一九四八年上半年货币收入预算，为了掩饰收支悬殊情形起见，列为五十八万亿元，但据蒋匪立法院代理秘书长楼桐荪本月七日供认：预料实际收入不会超过此数百分之六十，即三十五万亿元。并透露：占全部岁出百分之八十以上的战费及“交通费”与所谓“建设费”等皆全无着落。据此估计，今年全年货币实收难望达到一百万亿元，蒋匪今年货币赤字将超过百分之九十。
    粮食收入方面，一九四七年田赋征实及征借配额（包括地方一级）共为稻谷六千四百七十七万市担（据去年十二月八日沪大公报，小麦及高粱均已折合稻谷），实收仅约为配额七成，蒋匪中央政府计实得稻谷二千五百六十三万市担，粮食赤字为百分之三十以上。今年度蒋匪征实征借配额竟增为稻谷八千万市担，在四川及两湖收购军粮一千万担，蒋匪中央政府预计分得五千万担，但随着蒋区农民日益破产与反抗，以及人民解放军的胜利进攻，蒋匪粮食实收将远低于此数，粮食赤字将更增大。
    对外支付方面，在去年蒋区的国际支付项目中，正常贸易入超为二亿二千余万美元；走私入超据与蒋匪官方有关的北平“正论”杂志的最低估计数字为一亿美元；偿付外债本息四千五百万美元；蒋匪政府驻外人员费用约为六千五百万美元；外人在华企业利润，及利息至少为五千万美元。以上合计为四亿八千万美元以上。收入项下华侨汇款已激减为不足五千万美元；外人在蒋区费用约为五千万美元；蒋匪历次出售美国移让剩余物资约为一亿美元，以上合计全部收入不足二亿美元，收支逆差在二亿八千万美元以上。再加去年蒋匪对外战费一亿三千万美元，就使这种逆差更加恶化，而增为四亿一千万美元以上。另据蒋匪财政部一高级官员朱契所发表数字，去年蒋匪每个月国际收支逆差为三千六百万美元，则去年全年收支逆差共为四亿三千二百万美元，与我们上面估计的数字极为接近。一九四八年此种情况将更为发展。
    蒋匪弥补逐年增大的货币赤字的唯一办法，就是用滥发纸币的办法剥削人民；年前为止，蒋币发行额已超过一百万亿元，较之前年底发行额高了十倍。四大家族从通货膨胀物价高涨中大发其财，使广大蒋区人民的血汗化为四大家族的私产。这种情形，就直接造成了蒋区劳动人民的饥饿，民族工业的破产。去年十二月蒋匪上海市社会局公布的工人生活指数仅为六万八千倍，不及该月物价指数的一半。而蒋匪政权机构中数百万的士兵及公教人员，亦已陷于饥饿状态。工商业则纷纷破产停业。
    蒋匪逐年增加的征粮、抢购、征发及地方摊派，就是蒋匪国家垄断资本集团向蒋区农民榨取的额外封建地租，因而吸干了蒋区农民的脂血。蒋区自耕农民负担通常达到百分之六十五至八十，而佃农在以全年收入百分之五十以上交付地主的地租外，通常还要交纳全年收入百分之十五至二十的摊派负担。在冀东、豫北、辽宁蒋占区，农民罄尽所有，还不够交纳蒋匪赋税摊派。其另一结果就是：农业耕作日益粗放，农田水利陷于废弛，土地抛荒日多（年前已超过五千万亩），于是蒋区农业生产激降，一九四七年，稻谷收成较战前正常年份减少了三成三，小麦减少四成，其他高粱，蕃薯等项杂粮均减收三成以上。去年蒋区粮产与最低需要量比较，到今年收获期之前，稻谷不足三百万公吨（合六千万担），小麦不足二百八十万公吨（约合五千六百万担），预示着威胁蒋区千百万人民生存的严重粮荒就在眼前。蒋管区人民抗粮抗丁要饭吃的民变运动，将在这一基础上更广泛发展起来。
    最后，由于蒋匪对外支付赤字与国际收支逆差的发展，造成了蒋匪外汇枯竭的危机。蒋匪已更加无条件地仰仗美帝的输血，与更加放肆地出卖国家主权。目前蒋匪正经由大买办及卖国贼孔祥熙、贝祖诒，向其华尔街的主子乞求贷款救命，但是两年来的事实证明美帝的援助是救不了泥沼中愈陷愈深的蒋介石的。
