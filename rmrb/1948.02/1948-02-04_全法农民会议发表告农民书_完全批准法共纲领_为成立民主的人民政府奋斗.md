Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: Paris dispatch: The National Farmers' Conference convened by the French Communist Party issued a letter to French farmers at the end of last month, denouncing "the Schumann government for continuing its harmful policy of subordinating the French economy to Wall Street." It emphasized, "The so-called Marshall Plan is aimed at infringing upon the fundamental interests of French farmers." The letter continued: When the Meyer emergency tax plan was discussed in the two houses of parliament, only the Communist Party members of parliament voted against it, while the Socialists, the Gaullists, and the Popular Republican Movement members passed the bill, which once again illustrates that "only the French Communist Party is the consistent defender of the interests of farmers." The letter concluded by stating: "This conference fully approves the Communist Party's program, which aims to improve the living standards of French farmers and protect the interests of national agriculture. This conference approves the demand to establish a truly democratic people's government, which can liberate our country from foreign enslavement and lead our country along the path of progress." The letter finally called on French male and female farmers to actively participate in the "National Protest Day" to be held on February 2nd to oppose the policies pursued by the current French government.

    全法农民会议发表告农民书
    完全批准法共纲领
    为成立民主的人民政府奋斗
    【新华社陕北二日电】巴黎讯：法共召开之全国农民会议，于上月底发表告法国农民书，指斥“舒曼政府继续其将法国经济屈从于华尔街的有害政策。”并强调指出：“所谓马歇尔计划，是针对着侵害法国农民的基本利益的”。该书继称：在议会两院中讨论迈耶紧急征税计划时，只有法共议员投反对票，而社会党人，戴高乐派、人民共和党员等，却通过了这一法案，这再一次说明“只有法共是农民利益的始终不变的保卫者”。该书结语力称：“本会完全批准了共产党的纲领，该纲领目的在于改善法国农民生活水平及保护全国农业利益。本会批准成立真正民主的人民政府的要求，这个政府能将我国从外国奴役中解放出来，并领导我国沿着进步的道路迈进”。该书最后号召：法国男女农民积极参加将于二月二日举行的“全国抗议运动日”，以反对法国现政府所追求的政策。
