    Central Bureau Liquidation Committee Issues Notice
    Clearing Up Agency Production
    Determining Supplementary Measures
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Central Bureau Agency Production Liquidation Committee issued its first notice to the various district party committees, administrative offices, and military regions on February 3rd, stating:
    Now, based on the Central Bureau's decision regarding clearing up agency production, and in response to the issues recently raised by various districts and units, the following supplementary opinions are provided for reference and implementation:
    1.  In order to promote hands-on work and develop production, family-run factories of agencies and troops are still permitted to exist. However, family-run stores and cooperatives of a similar store nature must be abolished without exception.
    2.  Family-run factories and agency mills may hire technicians for a certain period to increase product output and improve quality, but it is strictly forbidden to engage in disguised forms of hired labor management.
    3.  All factories and coal kilns, during the process of receiving and transferring them, must continue working with the spirit of "production first, then clearing and handover," and must not suspend work without reason, affecting production.
    4.  For all factories, shops, transportation tools, livestock, bulk cotton, cloth, salt, medicine, telecommunications, printing, military equipment, etc., that are transferred to industry and commerce, transportation, and supply departments, the valuation should be handled according to market conditions and based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness. If there are disputes, the liquidation committees at all levels may designate specific personnel to jointly assess the final price with the transferring and receiving agencies. Both parties must abide by the assessed price.
    5.  Factories, shops, transportation tools, livestock, bulk cotton, cloth, salt, medicine, telecommunications, military, printing equipment, etc., produced by agencies at all levels, should generally be transferred to the corresponding level of industry and commerce, transportation, and supply departments for reception after valuation. However, if larger factories, telecommunications, health, and other equipment and materials are received at all levels, they must be reported and remitted to the Border Region Government's Industry Department or the Supply Department of the Greater Military Region.
    6.  Private funds of cadres and soldiers from agencies, troops, organizations, schools, and economic departments are not allowed to be invested in private stores and local cooperatives. After being withdrawn from agency production, they can only be deposited in banks or stores designated by the liquidation committees at all levels. At the border region level, the "Tongren Cooperative" will be used as a basis to absorb the private funds of cadres and soldiers, with its business led by the Trade General Company. A management committee will be organized separately by the administrative departments of each agency to conduct inspection and supervision.
    7.  In order to solve certain deficits of agencies and units at all levels and some difficulties that may arise due to the abolition of agency production, 20% of the received assets may be retained. However, this 20% can only be retained after all agency production has been cleared up and approved by the superior liquidation committee.
    8.  In order to further deepen the cleanup work, all food service units must organize their own liquidation committees to be responsible for clearing up the agency production and assets of their units. The Party branch should play a guaranteeing role. The organization and cleanup methods shall be formulated by the agencies themselves.
    9.  Transferable houses and furniture in the agency stores and factories in various cities can be examined and handled by the liquidation committees at all levels. Usable items should be centrally stored for future use. Furniture from production agencies in various villages and towns shall be auctioned off and used as public income.
    10. In addition to being responsible to the district party committee liquidation committee, the liquidation committees of each unit are also responsible to the central bureau liquidation committee. To facilitate the work, the greater military region liquidation committee will no longer be established, and the central bureau liquidation committee will uniformly preside over the process.

    中央局清委会发出通知
    清理机关生产
    确定补充办法
    【本报消息】中央局机关生产清理委员会于二月三日向各区党委、各行署、各军区发出第一号通知，内称：
    兹根据中央局关于清理机关生产决定，及就近日各区各单位提出之问题，特补充以下几点意见，请参照执行。
    一、为提倡亲自动手，发展生产，各机关部队之家属工厂仍允许存在，但家属商店以及类似商店性质的合作社均须一律取消。
    二、家属工厂、机关粉坊，为增加产品提高质量，在一定期间可聘请技师，但须严禁变相雇工经营。
    三、所有工厂、煤窑在接收移转过程中，均须本一面生产，一面清理移交之精神，继续工作，不得无故停工影响生产。
    四、凡移交工商、交通、供给部门之工厂、商店、运输工具、牲畜、大宗棉花、布、盐、医药、电讯、印刷、军用器材等，其作价应按市场情形，本公平合理之原则办理。如有争执，可由各级清委会指定专人，会同交接机关，作最后之评定，评定价格，双方均须服从。
    五、各级机关生产之工厂、商店、运输工具、牲畜、大宗棉花、布、盐、医药、电讯、军用、印刷器材等作价后，一般均应移交同级工商、交通、供给部门接收。但如遇较大工厂、电讯、卫生等设备器材，各级收到后须报解边府工业厅或大军区供给部。
    六、机关部队、团体、学校及经济部门干部战士私人资金，不得投入私人商店及地方合作社，从机关生产抽出后，只准存银行或各级清委会指定之商店。边区级以同仁合作社为基础，吸收干部、战士私人资金，其业务归贸易总公司领导，另由各机关行政部门组织管理委员会，进行检查监督事宜。
    七、为解决各级机关单位某些亏空，及因取消机关生产可能发生的某些困难，于接收资财中，截留二成，但此二成须俟全部机关生产清理完毕，并经上级清委会审核批准后，始得截留。
    八、为清理工作更深入一步，各伙食单位均须组织本单位清理委员会，负责进行本单位机关生产及资财之清理，支部应起保证作用。组织及清理办法，各机关自行制定。
    九、各城市机关商店、工厂中之移交房屋、家具，可分别交由各级清委会审查处理。可用者应集中保管，以备使用。各村镇生产机关之家具准予自行拍卖，作为公家收入。
    十、各单位之清理委员会，除对区党委清理委员会负责外，并应对中央局清理委员会负责，为便于工作，大军区清理委员会不再设立，统一由中央局清委会主持进行。
