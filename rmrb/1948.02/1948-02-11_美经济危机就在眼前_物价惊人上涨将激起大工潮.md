    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Washington dispatch: The American financial market has already shown that an American economic crisis is imminent. On February 4th, the prices of domestic securities in the United States clearly fell, the extent of which "was only seen since February of last year" (TASS). On the 5th, Truman said in a panic at a press conference: "Unless the shocking rise in domestic prices in the past two months can be curbed, and a method to stop the increasingly serious inflation is found, economic collapse is inevitable." The U.S. Department of Labor also stated in a report on the same day: "Retail food prices had already risen to a peak on December 15th of last year, exceeding previous records by twelve percent."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Washington dispatch: The high prices in the United States will incite large-scale labor movements. According to TASS: In 1947, the profits obtained by many companies due to raising prices were almost twice as high as the profits in 1946. As a result of high prices, the actual wages of the working class have been greatly reduced, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the working masses. The reactionary chairman of the American Federation of Labor, Green, also predicted at the end of last month: "Wage increase demands will sweep the country." The AFL Executive Committee had to admit: "The American people can no longer endure indefinite and cruel economic exploitation." And they said fearfully: "The United States is on the eve of a storm, and in the next seven months, the United States will experience the most serious labor unrest in history." They all believe that "it is too late to prevent nationwide wage increase demands in the spring!" Currently, localized labor unrest is rising one after another. The United Mine Workers of America is brewing a new major strike to protest the capitalists' violation of the contract by not paying old miners' pensions.

    美经济危机就在眼前
    物价惊人上涨将激起大工潮
    【新华社陕北八日电】华盛顿讯：美国金融市场已经显示出来美国经济危机迫在眉睫。二月四日美国国内证券的价格显然下跌，其程度“为去年二月以来所仅见”（塔斯社）。五日，杜鲁门于记者招待会中惊惶的说：“除非两月来国内物价的惊人上涨得以遏止，并找出一个制止愈演愈烈的通货膨胀之方法，否则经济崩溃不可避免”。美国劳工部于同日的报告中，亦称：“食粮零售价格去年十二月十五日已涨到顶点，越过以往纪录百分之十二”。
    【新华社陕北八日电】华盛顿讯：美国物价的高涨，将激起大规模的工人运动。据塔斯社讯：在一九四七年，许多公司因抬高物价而得的利润几乎高达一九四六年利润的两倍。物价高涨结果，已大大降低了工人阶级的实际工资，致引起了工人大众的普遍不满。反动的美国劳工联合会主席格林，于上月底也预见到：“增资要求将席卷全国”。劳联执委会不得不承认：“美国人民已经不能忍受无限期残酷的经济压榨”。并且恐惧的说：“美国正处在暴风雨前夕，今后七个月内，美国将爆发历史上最严重的工潮。”他们都认为“防止春季全国性的增资要求已经太晚了！”目前局部性的工潮正此起彼伏中。美国矿工联合会为抗议资方违反合同不付老矿工的养老年金，正酝酿新的大罢工。
