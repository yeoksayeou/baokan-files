　　Yan'nan Village Breaks Old Habits
  　Production Starts on the Third Day of the New Year
    [Neiqiu News] Yan'nan Village Chief Fang Zhenkui and Political Director Huo Laicheng convened a production committee on the second day of the Lunar New Year to discuss when to start production this year. The majority of cadres suggested starting production on the third day. Wu Weihui Director Liu Lianxi said: This is good, but we need to let the masses study it carefully. From the third to the fifteenth day, because the ground has not yet thawed, we will focus on collecting firewood. Overcome the old thinking of "sitting on the seventeenth and fearing the eighteenth." The meeting also reviewed the textile work. The achievements of the hundred-day textile campaign last winter were not significant. This year, cadres should take the lead, form core groups, and lead general groups. On the evening of the second day, a mass meeting was held, attended by more than seventy men and women. The village chief first mobilized everyone, saying that this year our district is a disaster area, and the food is relatively good during the first month of the New Year, so we must produce well. In the past, "sitting on the seventeenth and fearing the eighteenth" had many disadvantages. Let's discuss when we should start production this year and what we should do. Fang Qinggong, who is in his fifties, said: I say we should start production tomorrow because the spring is short this year, and the Awakening of Insects is on the twenty-fifth. After the Awakening of Insects, the ground will thaw, and it will be time for major production. Now we should collect firewood and fertilizer. As the saying goes, "What you do in your spare time will save you work when you're busy." If there is more firewood, we won't have to worry about fuel for planting and will be able to concentrate on production. The old sayings of the past should be overthrown. Liu Cun (a peasant who has been emancipated) said: We should break old habits. In the old society, we worked for the landlords. Now we are working for ourselves, and the sooner the better. The masses all said: What those two said is right. Song Jinsheng added: Our village has twenty or thirty laborers, and one day of rest is equal to twenty or thirty workdays. How much less work will we do if we rest for half a month? If we collect firewood, we will cut three or four hundred bundles less. In the end, everyone agreed to start the next day. The women also agreed to textile production. At the meeting, it was decided that men should cut one bundle of firewood per day, and women should spin one pound of yarn every five days, depending on the speed of spinning. On the third day, after eating breakfast, the village chief and political director shouted and urged everyone to go to the eastern mountain to collect firewood. The masses in the whole village also mobilized on the third day. Of the twenty-eight full and semi-laborers in the village, nineteen went to the eastern mountain, and the remaining eight or nine (semi-auxiliary laborers) also went to nearby places to cut firewood. Statistics for the day showed a total of twenty-five or six bundles of firewood were cut. The masses all said: This is very good. Sitting is sitting, and cutting one bundle is one bundle, which is better than staying at home.

　　岩南村打破旧习惯
  　正月初三开始生产
    【内邱消息】岩南村长房振魁，政治主任霍来成，在大年初二召开生产委员会，研究今年啥时生产。大多数干部意见，初三就开始生产。武委会主任刘连喜说：这样好是好，可得好好叫群众研究研究。初三到十五日，因地还没消冻，突击打柴。克服过去的坐十七、骇十八的旧思想。会上对纺织工作也作了检讨。去冬百日纺织成绩不大，今年要干部带头，成立核心组，带领起一般的组。初二晚上便召开群众大会，到会的男女有七十多人。首由村长动员大家，他说，今年咱区是灾荒区，在正月饭食也比较好，咱们要好好生产。过去“坐十七骇十八”，有好多害处，大家讨论讨论，咱们今年啥时开始生产，都干些啥。五十多岁的房庆公说：叫我说明天就开始生产，今年春短，二十五就惊蛰，惊蛰后地就消了，就该大生产了，现在应该打柴集肥。常说“闲时做的忙时活”，柴火多了，养种地不愁烧，就能安心生产，过去的旧说法应该打倒。刘存（翻身户）说：应该打破旧习惯，旧社会给地主受，现在是给咱做的，越早越好。群众都说：人家二人说的对。宋金生又说：咱村二三十个劳力，歇一天就是二三十个工。歇半月就少做多少活？要打柴就少割三四百担。最后大家赞成第二天下手。妇女纺织也同意了。会上决定男人每天割一担柴火，妇女按纺的快慢，一般的每五天纺一斤线。初三那天，吃了早饭，村长政治主任连喊带叫的上了东山打柴。全村群众初三也都动起来了。全村整半劳力二十八人，上东山的就有十九个，其余的八、九人（半辅劳力）也都去近地方割柴了。一天统计，共割柴二十五六担。群众都说：这样很好，坐着也是坐着，割一担是一担，总比在家强。
