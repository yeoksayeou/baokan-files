Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: New York dispatch: American Labor Party candidate, Isaacson, has won an overwhelming victory in the special election for a seat in the House of Representatives in the Bronx, a Democratic stronghold in New York State. Isaacson received 55.9 percent of the vote, while the Democratic candidate received only 31 percent. In 1946, the Labor Party only received 27 percent of the vote, while the Democrats received 43 percent. Now the situation has been reversed. Therefore, all American newspapers have had to admit that the Labor Party's victory is clear evidence that the pro-Wallace progressive forces can deliver a serious blow to the Democratic presidential campaign. According to a TASS dispatch on the 19th, Isaacson's victory "has caused great joy among progressives throughout the United States and great distress among the leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties." An afternoon newspaper stated that it poses a serious threat to the Democratic presidential campaign in New York State. Labor Party Chairman Marcantonio said that voters' election of Isaacson shows that they reject the Marshall Plan, oppose high living costs and anti-labor bills, as well as anti-communist and anti-people actions. It also shows that they oppose the reactionary policies of creating war and economic depression, and at the same time, it is equivalent to voting for Wallace and a third party. The Associated Press said that the scale of the Labor Party's victory is particularly surprising to political observers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: New York dispatch: The movement of American people supporting Wallace's election campaign is growing. The third party in Maryland held its founding conference in Baltimore. 630 delegates attended the meeting, resolving to support Wallace as a presidential candidate, vigorously promote democratic reforms in the United States, and criticize the Marshall Plan. Another 250 delegates also held a conference in Annapolis, Indiana, deciding to establish the "People's Progressive Party" in the state to support Wallace's election campaign.

　　美国劳工党
  　在纽约州选举获胜
  　两个州成立新党支持华莱士
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】纽约讯：美国劳工党候选人伊萨克逊，在纽约州民主党堡垒的波伦特区之众院议员补缺选举中，已赢得压倒的胜利。伊氏获票百分之五十五点九，而民主党候选人仅得百分之三十一。一九四六年时劳工党只获百分之二十七的选票，而民主党则为百分之四十三，现在局势已倒转过来。因此，美国所有的报纸都不得不承认：劳工党的胜利，是亲华莱士的进步势力能够给民主党竞选总统以严重打击的明证。据塔斯社十九日电报导：伊萨克逊的获胜，“引起了全美进步人士的极大快慰，使共和党与民主党的首脑部，甚感苦恼”。下午报称：遗给予民主党在纽约州竞选总统严重的威胁。劳工党主席马肯特里说：选民们投票选举伊萨克逊的意义，说明了他们摈斥马歇尔计划，反对高昂生活费用和反劳工法案以及反共反人民的行动，也说明了他们反对制造战争及经济萧条的反动政策，同时等于投票信任华莱士及第三党。美联社说：劳工党胜利的规模，是特别使政治观察家惊奇的。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】纽约讯：美国人民拥护华莱士竞选的运动，日益增长。玛利兰州的第三党，已于巴尔的摩举行成立大会。到会代表达六三○人，决议拥护华莱士为总统候选人，力促加强美国民主改革，并抨击马歇尔计划。另有二五○名代表亦于印第安纳州的安纳波里斯举行大会，决定在该州成立“人民进步党”，以支持华莱士竞选。
