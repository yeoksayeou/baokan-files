Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. The Logistics Department of the Northwestern Joint Defense Army recently held a meeting of ministers of its subordinate departments to review the work of the logistics departments in supply, health, and stationing over the past ten months, and to discuss methods for future improvement. Comrade He Long, Commander of the Joint Defense Army, and Comrade Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Field Army, both attended the meeting and gave instructions. Comrade Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Joint Defense Army, in his summary report, called on all comrades in logistics work to firmly implement the supply policy of unified planning and unified expenditure and strictly establish various logistics systems under the unified leadership of the Logistics Department of the Northwestern Joint Defense Army. Commander Wang pointed out that over the past few years, both the large collective and the small collective have accumulated considerable savings in the development of production. The unification of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui border regions, as well as the connection and support of various liberated areas, have provided the region with sufficient conditions for implementing unified planning and unified expenditure. However, it is necessary to correct the erroneous perception of some people who believe that unified planning and unified expenditure simply means asking the large collective for money. It is essential to deeply recognize that unified planning and unified expenditure not only guarantees the supply of the small collective by the large collective but also lies in the unification of policies, leadership, standards, and systems, and everyone should work hard to find ways. Commander Wang also pointed out: First, we must establish the idea that everything is for supporting the front line and guaranteeing the supply of the front line. When mobilizing all forces, we should unify the soldiers' viewpoint with the masses' viewpoint and implement the policy of taking both military and civilian needs into consideration. We should also implement economic democracy in the troops, stop all expenditures beyond the standards. In order to guarantee supply and eliminate certain concerns, Commander Wang specifically explained: (1) All expenditures that have not been reported for final settlement in the past but were self-sufficient through production, if they are legitimate and necessary, are still included within the scope of supply standards; (2) Guarantee the timely supply of goods or funds. To avoid the impact of rising prices on actual purchasing power, one month's funding can be pre-paid; (3) The prices stipulated in the supply standards should be consistent with local market prices, and if there is a temporary increase, it will be appropriately raised.

    西北联防军检讨后勤工作
    严格确立各种制度
    贯彻统筹统支方针
    【新华社西北八日电】西北联防军后勤部最近召开所属各部部长会议，检讨十个月来后勤部门供给、卫生、兵站等工作，并讨论今后改进方法。联防军司令员贺龙同志、西北野战军副司令员张宗逊同志均到会指示，联防军副司令员王维舟同志在总结报告中号召全体后勤工作同志在西北联防军后勤部的统一领导下，坚决贯彻统筹统支的供给方针及严格确立各种后勤制度。王司令员指出几年来大公家小公家在发展生产中均有相当积蓄，陕甘宁、晋绥两边区的统一，以及各解放区的联系与支援，使本区具备了实行统筹统支的足够条件，但必须纠正某些人以为统筹统支只是伸手向大公家要钱的错误认识，必须深刻认识统筹统支不仅是大公家保证小公家的供给，而且更在于政策、领导、标准、制度的统一，要大家努力设法。王司令员并指出：首先确定一切为着支援前线保障前线的供给思想，而在动员一切力量时，应把士兵观点与群众观点统一起来，贯彻军民兼顾方针。并在部队中实行经济民主，停止一切标准以外的开支，为了保证供给消除某些顾虑，王司令员特说明：（一）凡过去未报决算而生产自给的开支，属于正当和必要的，仍包括在供给标准范围内；（二）保证实物或经费按时供给，为避免物价上涨影响实际购买力，可预支一个月经费；（三）供给标准所规定的物价和当地市价一致，如临时上涨，则予以适当提高。
