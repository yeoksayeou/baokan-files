　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee, the CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau, and the Military Region Headquarters have sent a telegram congratulating the Northeast People's Liberation Army on the great victory of recovering Anshan and Fakou and annihilating two enemy divisions. The telegram stated: "Under your victorious offensive, the day of liberating the entire Northeast is not far off. We will definitely strengthen our operations in North China to cooperate with your powerful offensive."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: A TASS Shanghai dispatch on the 20th, discussing the great significance of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's capture of Anshan, stated: "The economy of the KMT-controlled areas in the Northeast, which has been extremely weakened, has suffered another blow. In military terms: the People's Liberation Army has tightened the blockade of the Shenyang-Dalian Railway; strengthened the encirclement around southwestern Manchuria." The US imperialist semi-official news agency, the United Press, exclaimed in alarm: The capture of this, Chiang's "third strongest stronghold in Manchuria," "exposes the southern flank of Shenyang to further pincer movements by the Communists (People's Liberation Army)," admitting that this is a "fatal blow to Chiang's tottering military situation in Manchuria." Another US imperialist news agency, the Associated Press, also acknowledged that Chiang's hope of restoring railway traffic from Yingkou to Shenyang is even more remote.

　　晋察冀电贺东北大捷
    塔斯社评称：攻克鞍山人民解放军已紧缩对沈大铁路的封锁
    【新华社晋察冀二十四日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会、中共晋察冀中央局、军区司令部顷电贺东北解放军收复鞍山、法库歼敌两师大捷，贺电中说：“在你们的胜利攻势下，解放全东北的日子已经不远了。我们一定加强在华北的作战，配合你们雷霆万钧的攻势。”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】二十日塔斯社上海电论述东北人民解放军攻克鞍山之重大意义称：“已被极端削弱的东北蒋区经济，又受到了另一打击。在军事方面：人民解放军已紧缩了对沈（阳）大（连）铁路的封锁；加强了围绕满洲西南部的环箍”。美帝半官方通讯社合众社则惊呼：这个蒋匪“在满洲的第三强大堡垒”的被攻克，“便使沈阳南翼暴露于共军（人民解放军）的进一步钳击之前”，承认这是蒋匪“飘摇中的满洲军事形势的致命打击”。美帝另一通讯社美联社也承认，蒋匪要恢复由营口到沈阳的铁路交通线，这一希望是更渺茫了。
