    Many Village Cadres Act Undemocratically
    The Masses are Oppressed and Have Not Fully Overthrown the Old Order
    We are using the largest amount of space possible to welcome comrades from all over the border region participating in the land redistribution work to exchange work situations, exchange work opinions, and research work problems, and concentrate opinions from multiple parties and then jointly solve them. Whether it's systematic or fragmented, material or experience; whether it's in the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing news reports and diaries, any form is good, just write out what you want to say; do not use Party jargon or empty talk. Other comrades can also write letters to discuss if they have different opinions. Each place has its own specific circumstances, and the reports published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for everyone's reference.
              Editor Comrades:
    We went to Qianbailin and Tuling Villages in the Seventh District of Wu'an on January 24th to inspect winter poverty alleviation and production loans, and returned on February 1st. During these ten days, after in-depth investigations of the poor and hired peasants and promoting the Land Law Outline, we heard some reflections from the masses that there were many problems in both the loans and the village's land reform and cadre situation. In addition to the loan issues being organized into a separate manuscript and sent to the Party newspaper, we believe that these mass reflections are of reference value to the implementation of the Land Law and are also what the poor and hired peasants want to say, so we are sending them to the Party newspaper.
  Materials from Qianbailin Village
    (1) Regarding the distribution of the fruits of the struggle in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947, the masses have the following reflections:
    In order to expand the cooperative's shares, the village cadres converted the main materials in the floating assets from the fruits of the struggle (including 10,572 catties of grain, 130,000 yuan in cash, 1,413 catties of cotton, 55,000 yuan worth of sheep, 80,000 yuan worth of trees, and 45,000 yuan worth of silverware) into 1,071,790 yuan in total, and invested it in the cooperative in the name of the farmers' association. For a year, it has not been approved and the share certificates have not been distributed to the masses. (This number was learned from the cooperative.) The poor and hired peasants are also dissatisfied with the cooperative, saying that the poor and hired peasants cannot get credit, but the cadres can, and the poor and hired peasants are not given money when they have difficulties. The cooperative cadres also said: The cooperative is not enough to use.
    When distributing the houses from the fruits of the struggle in the spring of 1947, the political director Liu Engong and the village chief Zhu Shichang both had houses, but they exchanged them for better houses, which the masses were not satisfied with. The saying "cadres live in brick houses, the masses live in mud caves" is circulating in the village. This is a common reflection of the poor and hired peasants. However, the poor and hired peasants cannot get good houses. For example, Liu Weitang originally got a better house, but when distributing the houses, he was asked to move to a more dilapidated house.
    There were ten livestock (three mules, three cows, and four donkeys) in the fruits of the struggle. The village stipulated that priority should be given to family members of soldiers (who would not provide labor after buying), and then to the poor and hired peasants; therefore, nine were bought by family members of soldiers, and only one small donkey was bought by a poor peasant because no family member of soldiers wanted it. The village also used more than 600,000 yuan from the sale of livestock and 416 silver yuan from the fruits of the struggle as funds for militia armed construction (actually for militia production), without distributing them to the masses; (this is on the village's books). Even in the distribution of houses, land, and floating assets, the first and second priorities were for family members of soldiers, followed by the poor and hired peasants. For example, the poor and hired peasant Liu Weitang said: "Good land, nearby land, good things, and good houses were all given to family members of soldiers, we couldn't get them. I only got six dilapidated houses, a broken cabinet, a pair of vases, and a broken iron pot (three pieces, unusable)." The land of the poor peasants is mostly far away and in fragmented plots. For example, Liu Risheng has six mu of land, more than three mu are six li away, and more than two mu are three li away. These six mu of land are divided into dozens of plots.
    (2) Some district and village cadres have great power, oppress the masses, and the poor and hired peasants dare not speak:
    Last year, when Qianbailin organized a women's factory, the daughter-in-law of the Second Tang (the lover of the public security officer Liu Guozhen) went to mobilize the women next door to the poor peasant Li Jufu to participate in weaving. Li Jufu's wife said to the neighbor's wife (name not remembered): "We are in the same group, she is a prostitute, don't join her group." The Second Tang's daughter-in-law heard this and said to the public security officer Liu Guozhen: "She is scolding me, you have to stand up for me and arrest her!" Liu Guozhen used his power as a public security officer and said that Li Jufu's wife was sabotaging the factory, so he arrested Li's wife, detained her for several days, and did not allow the children to see their mother. After Li Jufu asked someone to intercede, he was released on bail.
    The poor and hired demobilized soldier Guo Tingzi reflected that the political director Liu Engong had been in a relationship with the prostitute woman "Xiao Kaitong" for many years (originally the village chief Zhu Shichang was her lover, and the village chief and political director were not united because of her and often bickered). Guo Tingzi caught them in the act nine times. Last summer, the masses held a meeting to confess their mistakes and said that they would guarantee to change in the future. Later, when planting wheat, Guo Tingzi caught them in the act again in the field. At that time, Liu Engong was very scared, kowtowed many times, and promised Guo Tingzi four conditions: 1. Make you a cadre; 2. Give you a better house and better land; 3. Buy you a good mule; 4. Solve all your difficulties. Because of this incident, Liu Engong held a grudge and beat a landlord's wife hard during the struggle, and asked her to confess that she had a relationship with Guo Tingzi.
    The poor and hired Liu Fuhe's pig ran to the village chief's grandmother's house (family member of a soldier). Liu Fuhe's child went to look for it. The child in the village chief's grandmother's house was hitting the pig, and the two children quarreled a few words. The village chief became angry and said that Liu Fuhe's wife was oppressing the family members of soldiers and beat them, so he arrested Liu Fuhe (when it was the time to harvest and plant wheat). Liu Fuhe's wife was so scared that she asked people to intercede everywhere before he was temporarily released for six days, three days to work for the family members of soldiers, and three days to hurry and harvest the autumn crops before being arrested again. The wheat was not planted at that time. At the same time, Liu Fuhe's wife was in confinement after giving birth. After such an uproar, the child also died. (Liu Fuhe said)
    When we went to inspect the loans this time, the village cadres initially made noodles for us (we didn't say we wanted to eat) and brought cigarettes. We refused and asked him to send us to the homes of the poor and hired peasants to eat. Because he did not issue the loans, the village cadres (mainly the political director and the head of the cooperative) fabricated a list of loans and convened meetings of each neighborhood, forcing the poor and hired peasants to say that they had received the loans. When we started the investigation, the poor and hired peasants said they had received them. Later, after clarifying the situation, we asked the poor and hired peasants why they told lies. The poor and hired peasants said they were afraid of retaliation from the cadres, being imprisoned, and being labeled. (The village cadres followed behind when we visited the poor and hired peasants.)
    Guo Benxian, who used to be the district head in Yangyi, is from Qianbailin. The masses said that he was a landlord before (now the masses say that he is a district head in Huixian or Xinxiang, and the cadres of our organization in Bailin Village say that he is in Tangyin). The masses wanted to settle accounts with him, so he was called back last year and gathered the masses in the village. A table was placed on the stage, he sat on the chair, a notebook was placed on the table, and he held a pen in his hand and said to the masses: "Raise your opinions!" A poor peasant ×× (name not remembered) said, "I used to herd sheep for you, you oppressed me and beat me." He then distorted the facts and said: "I didn't beat you, your father beat me. If it weren't for you being a poor and hired peasant, I would have shelled you long ago." (Meaning executed). As a result, the masses dispersed in a commotion. At the same time, the village cadres reported that his family members were difficult to deal with. (Li Jufu, Liu Richang, Liu Engong said)
    (3) Qianbailin Village has a "poor and hired peasant organization" controlled by village cadres:
    When we arrived in Bailin, the village cadres said: "Last winter, when producing, the poor and hired peasants were identified, and there is a poor and hired peasant organization." The village cadres found ten bloodline poor and hired peasants (people who have suffered for many generations) in an erroneous way of "checking three generations" to find the poor and hired peasants. They found 64 poor and hired peasant households from the village's original 152 poor and hired peasant households, divided them into eight poor and hired peasant groups, elected group leaders, and designated the director of the farmers' association Liu Rilin (poor peasant) as the acting director of the poor and hired peasants. The village cadres said that the district asked them to identify them, but they did not hold a meeting. When we inspected the loans, the poor and hired peasants reflected that the political director Liu Engong used to be from a declining landlord family, but now he is a well-off middle peasant. Village chief Zhu Shichang worked as a hired laborer before the War of Resistance Against Japan, renting land. After rent reduction, he turned over and is now raising mules and hiring laborers to cultivate 23 mu of good land. When distributing the land last year, he also took out three mu of land. These are not poor and hired peasants, but they are still among the 64 "poor and hired peasants." The masses reflected that nine households in these 64 households are not poor and hired peasants (of which four households are known to be cadres), and they also proposed 13 poor and hired peasant households that are not in the 64 households.
  Materials from Tuling Village
    (1) Village cadres protect landlords: Village chief Liang Zhongqing (sound) (feudal landlord, separated from his family and transformed in the year of the War of Resistance Against Japan) and public security officer Zhang Hongshu (sound) (old middle peasant) protect landlord Zhang Tianxiang's sons Zhang Linshu and his brothers; last year, the masses demanded that they be brought back for struggle, they said: "We are responsible for the whereabouts of these two people; if they are brought back and hang themselves (commit suicide), you are responsible, the cadres are not responsible (because a special agent was brought back and hanged himself once)," and the masses dared not say anything; Guo Tianliang, Zhang Nianhai, etc. also said that the floating assets and silver of this old rich man have not been fully extracted.
    (2) Village cadres take more fruits of the struggle, and some district cadres also take away the fruits of the struggle from the masses: Last spring, during the struggle, the fruits were collected by the custody team, and scores were recorded at that time and collected in a large temple. The village cadres said: "Go and produce and chop firewood!" and said: "Everyone who is not a cadre, leave!" At that time, Li Fenglin, who was in charge of the custody of the fruits, and family members of soldiers (poor and hired Guo Guangji) were present and left after hearing these words; when distributing the fruits, the good things were gone, with a total difference of 100 points, with each point priced at 10,000 yuan. (Li Fenglin, Guo Guangji, Guo Tianliang said)
    District women cadre Meng Gaiting (from Xijing Village) worked in Tuling Village last year, and became sworn sisters with landlord Zhang Yuanlong's daughter-in-law Tian Lingting, living in his house all day and eating well; the masses reported that they "ate noodles with meat sauce and lamb dumplings." When the masses were distributing the fruits, she took a lot of things, including: a child's silver lock, three silver bracelets, two sheep, three shoe soles, a bamboo basket, a camel hair scarf, six feet of printed cloth, a child's red satin coat, and a weaving shuttle. District cadre Li Youcun took away a quilt cover and a mattress cover. District Armed Committee Director Li Jinnan took away a large piece of glass (gave 500 yuan) and two sheep. His brother is also a district cadre, and he also took a sheep when he passed by Tuling (reflected at the poor and hired peasants' meeting).
    Village political director Zhang Anfu told us after listening to the Land Law that his family still had two quilts from the fruits that were taken away without going through the farmers' association, and a small temple worth 10,000 yuan that he bought (not yet paid for) and was willing to give them to the masses.
    (3) Village cadres are undemocratic, the public security officer manipulates the farmers' association, and the masses dare not say anything.
    The poor and hired Zhang Nianhai constantly gives opinions to the cadres, and the cadres are not satisfied with him. Once, he carried a stretcher to the front line and saw that the bullets of a poor and hired militiaman were unusable, while the bullets of the militiaman from the tail-cutting household were good; he said: "The cadres are really problematic." The cadres heard this and said he was "sabotaging" and sent him to the district for detention. The district said that Nianhai was an honest peasant, but in order to save the "face" of the village cadres, they asked Nianhai to do odd jobs in the district and stayed for 18 days, and then introduced him back to the village for handling. The village cadres fined him eight days of hard labor and hoed millet for the family members of soldiers for eight days. When we talked to him about the Land Law and the poor and hired peasants being in charge of land redistribution, he said: "The cadres only say nice things, I am afraid of being deceived; in the past, the cadres asked us to give opinions, we gave them, and after you left, the village cadres retaliated against us." After we explained to him that "now is different from the past," he said angrily: "Your words move me deeply! Others are pressed down by stone slabs, I am pressed down by Mount Tai, hearing these words I just want to shake!"
    Liang Ernian said: He used to rent land from the village chief. Last year, when the cadres washed their faces and wiped off the black, he gave the village chief the opinion that "you oppressed me in the past." The village chief remembered this in his heart. When Liang Ernian's wife committed suicide by jumping into a well, he said that Liang Ernian forced his wife to death and struggled against him for two mu of land, four houses, and a vacant courtyard.
    Guo Tianliang is an activist in the farmers' association. Last year, when he washed the cadres' faces, he discussed giving opinions to the cadres with a peasant. The cadres said he was "holding a small group meeting" and sent him to the district for detention for ten days. (Guo Tianliang said)
    The public security officer has great power and manipulates the farmers' association; whoever he thinks is not good, he expels from the farmers' association. He said this: "Whoever is not good will be expelled from the farmers' association, it's like a father driving out his son, so you can suffer before coming back!" Once he expelled more than 30 people from the farmers' association. Guo Guangji (originally a poor peasant, now a new middle peasant) likes to talk about the shortcomings of the cadres, so he has been expelled from the farmers' association four times. The old man said: "I have 'entered and exited' the farmers' association four times." Zhang Qishan was expelled from the farmers' association because the public security officer protected landlord Zhang Tianxiang's nine sheep and he gave opinions. Zhang Nianhai and Guo Tianliang have both been expelled from the farmers' association. (Guo Guangji, Zhang Nianhai, Guo Tianliang, etc. said) -- We didn't say anything when we started talking to the masses, we asked again and again, the masses said: "We are afraid of being tied up!" (Hanging them up).
    (4) District and village cadres are in cahoots: When a cadre comes, they eat the village cadres' noodles and lamb cakes and say nothing; district cadres have never eaten at the homes of the poor and hired peasants (masses reported).
    (5) The political director distorts the Land Law: On the evening of the 29th, the village cadres returned from a meeting in the district and convened a plenary meeting of the farmers' association to read the Land Law. He read the poor peasant group as "people's group" and said "What is a poor and hired peasant? Everyone here is a poor and hired peasant." Comrade Guo Yuzhang (the cadre from our Jinnan Bank Wu'an Branch who inspected the loans) explained to the masses that it was not the "people's group" but the "poor peasant group," and explained what a poor and hired peasant is.
    The above materials are reflections we heard during these ten days of loan work, mostly from conversations with poor and hired peasants. Because the task was to inspect the loans and the time was limited, we did not conduct a detailed investigation and comparison. We wanted to organize the manuscript and send it, but we were afraid that it would be too simple and unclear, so we sent these original materials. If you need to publish it, please excerpt and organize it, otherwise transfer it to the relevant departments. I think it will be helpful to the work?
    How should such materials be organized to be suitable? I hope you can tell us when you have time, so that we can do it in the future.
        Sincerely,
              Wang Peizhang, Zhang Zhiyong, Yu Zhi
              Comrades Peizhang, Zhiyong, and Yu Zhi:
    Your materials are very well written; just write down and send us the materials you have investigated according to the facts, without being restricted by any form.
    In addition, the last paragraph of the Qianbailin Village material, which says to only use the method of "comparing history and comparing time" to check class composition, is inappropriate, so it has been deleted.

专栏：

    很多村干部作风不民主
    群众受欺压翻身没翻透
    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加平分土地工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。
              编辑同志：
    我们于一月二十四日到武安七区前柏林及土岭村检查冬季贫雇生产贷款，于二月一日返回。在这十天当中，经深入贫雇调查及宣传土地法大纲，听到一些群众反映，不论在贷款上及村中土改、干部情况上都存在着不少问题，除有关贷款问题另外整理稿子寄交党报外，我们认为这些群众反映，对土地法实行上有参考价值，同时也是贫雇要说的话，因此寄给党报。
  前柏林村的材料
    （一）在一九四六年冬及四七年春斗争果实分配上，群众有如下的几点反映：
    村干为了扩大合作社股金，将斗争果实浮财中的主要物资（内计粮食一万零五百七十二斤，现款十三万元，棉花一千四百一十三斤，羊折价五万五千元，树折价八万元，银器折价四万五千元）折价一百零七万一千七百九十元，以农会名义入股合作社，一年来未批红也未把股金票分配给群众。（这个数目是从合作社中了解的。）贫雇对合作社也不满意，说贫雇不能赊欠，干部能赊欠，贫雇有困难也不借给钱，合作社干部还说：合作社还不够用哩。
    四七年春分配斗争果实的房子时，政治主任刘恩功、村长朱世昌都有房子，但换了好宅子，群众不满意。村中流传着“干部住的砖圪顶，群众住的坯圪洞”。这是贫雇共同的反映。而贫雇却分不上好房子，如刘维堂原来分到的房子较好，分配房子时叫他搬到较破的一所宅子去。
    斗争果实中有十个牲口（计骡三、牛三、驴四），村中规定先尽抗属买，并按作价七折（抗属买后不代耕），其次才是贫雇；因此九个就被抗属买去，只有一个小驴，抗属没人要了，才叫贫农买了。村中并将牲口卖价六十余万元及果实中的银元四百一十六元，作为民兵武装建设费（实际是民兵生产用），未分给群众；（这是村中在帐的）。即连房、地、浮财分配上，头等二等都是抗属，次为贫雇。例如贫雇刘维堂说：“好地、近地、好东西、好宅子都分给了抗属，咱分不上，我只分了六间破房，一个破柜、一对花瓶、一个破铁锅（三块，不能用）。”贫农的地多是远地碎块地，如刘日升有六亩地，一去六里远的三亩多，一去三里远的二亩多，这六亩多地就有数十块。
    （二）某些区村干部权利大，欺压群众，贫雇不敢说话：
    去年前柏林组织妇女工厂时，二唐子媳妇（公安员刘国珍的相好的）去动员贫农李聚富邻家的妇女参加纺织，李聚富老婆向邻家妇女（名字记不清了）说：“咱们一组，她是破鞋，不参加她那组”。被二唐子媳妇听到，她就和公安员刘国珍说：“她骂我，你要给我出气，得扣起她来！”刘国珍就以公安员权力说李聚富老婆破坏工厂，就把李妻扣起来，扣了几天，也不让小孩见她娘，经李聚富托人说情找保才放出来。
    贫雇荣退军人郭廷子反映，政治主任刘恩功和破鞋妇女“小开通”多年有关系（原来村长朱世昌和她相好，村长、政治主任因她而不团结，经常斗气）。只郭廷子捉奸就捉住九次。去年夏天群众开会坦白了，并说今后保证改掉。后来种麦子时，在地里又被郭廷子捉住，当时刘恩功很害怕，磕了很多头，并允许郭廷子四个条件：一、叫你当干部；二、给你换好宅子好地；三、给你买一匹好骡子；四、大小困难都解决。因此事刘恩功记恨在心，在斗争一家地主女人时，硬打她，叫她招认和郭廷子有关系。
    贫雇刘福河的小猪跑到村长姥姥家（抗属），刘福河的小孩去找，正值他家的小孩向外打猪，两个小孩争吵了几句，村长就不行了，说刘福河老婆欺压抗属，打抗属了，就把刘福河扣起来，（正在收秋种麦的时候）吓的刘福河老婆到处托人说情，才暂时放出六天来，其中三天给抗属作活，三天急急忙忙收了秋又扣起来，麦子当时也未种上。同时刘福河老婆正值产后坐月子，经过这样一闹，小孩也死了。（刘福河谈）
    我们这次去检查贷款，村干一开始给我们做了面条（我们并未说吃饭），拿上了纸烟，我们拒绝了，叫他派到贫雇家去吃饭。因为他未把款贷出，村干（主要是政治主任和合作社长两人）假造贷款名单，并召开各闾会，强叫贫雇说把款贷到手中；我们开始调查时，贫雇都说贷了；后来弄清，问贫雇为什么说假话，贫雇说怕干部打击报复，怕坐禁闭，怕戴帽子。（我们访问贫雇时，村干后面跟着。）
    原来在阳邑当区长的郭本贤是前柏林人，群众说先前他是地主（现在群众说他在辉县或新乡当区长，我们机关柏林村的干部说他在汤阴），群众要向他清算，去年叫回来，召集了村中的群众，台上放一棹子，他坐在椅子上，棹上放了记录本，手中拿着钢笔，和群众说：有意见提吧！贫农××（名字记不清了）说，我从前给你放羊，你压迫我，打过我。他随之歪曲事实说：“我未打你，你父亲打了我，象你这样说，如不是贫雇的话，我非炮了你不可。”（意思是枪毙）。这样一来，群众都一哄而散了。同时，村干反映他的家属很难惹。（李聚富、刘日常、刘恩功谈）
    （三）前柏林村有村干掌握的“贫雇组织”：
    我们到柏林时，村干说：去年冬季生产时划了贫雇，有贫雇组织，是村干部找了十个血统贫雇（多辈受苦的人）以错误的“查三代”的方式来找贫雇，他们从村中原有的一百五十二户贫雇农当中找了六十四户贫雇，分成八个贫雇小组，都选出了小组长，并指定农会主任刘日林（贫农）代理贫雇主任，村干说是区上叫划的，但未开过会。当我们检查贷款时，贫雇反映：政治主任刘恩功，从前是地主破落下来的，现在时光是富裕中农。村长朱世昌，抗战前当长工，种租子地，减租后翻了身，现在喂着骡子，雇着长工种二十三亩好地，去年分配土地时，还拿出了三亩地。这都不是贫雇，但他们还在六十四户“贫雇”当中。群众反映，这六十四户中九户不是贫雇（其中已知者有四户是干部），并又提出不在六十四户之内的贫雇十三户。
  土岭村的材料
    （一）村干部包庇地主：村长梁中庆（音）（封建地主，抗战那一年分家化形）公安员张宏书（音）（老中农）包庇地主张天祥的儿子张林书等弟兄二人；去年群众要求弄回斗争，他俩说：“这两人的下落我们负责；如弄回来上吊死了（自杀）你们负责，干部不负责（因为曾有一个特务弄回来上吊死了），群众就不敢吭了；郭天亮、张年泰等还说这家老财的浮财银子还未斗出来。
    （二）村干部多占果实，还有些区干部拿走群众果实：去年春斗争时，果实是由保管组收集的，当时就登记分数，收集到一个大庙里。村干部说：“你们去生产砍柴吧！”并说：“不是干部的都走吧！”当时保管果实的李凤林和抗属（贫雇郭广吉）都在场，听到这话就走了；到分果实时，好东西没有了，共差一百分，每分作价一万元。（李凤林、郭广吉、郭天亮谈）
    区上妇女干部孟改廷（西井村人）去年在土岭村作工作，和地主张元龙的儿媳田玲廷拜干姊妹，整天住在他家，吃好的；群众反映是“吃面条肉卤羊肉饺子”。在群众分配果实时，她要了很多东西，计有：小孩银锁子一把，银手镯三只，羊二只，鞋底子三双，竹篮一个，驼毛好围巾一条，花布六尺，小孩红缎子大衣一件，织布梭一个。区干部李有存拿走被子面一件，褥子面一件，区武委会主任李金南拿走了大玻璃一块（给了五百元），羊二只。他兄弟也是区干部，路过土岭也要走一只羊（贫雇会上反映的）。
    村政治主任张安福听了土地法以后向我们说，他家还有果实中的两床被子是未经过农会拿去的，另有一万元买的小庙一座（还未付款）都愿给了群众。
    （三）村干不民主，公安员操纵农会，群众不敢吭。
    贫雇张年泰不断给干部提意见，干部不满意他。一次他抬担架到前方，见一贫雇民兵子弹都不能用，而割尾巴户民兵子弹好；他说：“干部真成问题”，干部听到后说他是“破坏”，送到区里禁闭。区里说年泰是老实农民，但为了转转村干的“面子”，叫年泰在区上作零活，住了十八天，然后又介绍回村处理，村干又罚他八天苦工，给抗属锄了八天谷子。当我们向他谈土地法平分土地贫雇当家时，他说：“干部光说漂亮话，我上当上怕了；从前干部叫咱提意见，我们提了，你们走了村干又打击咱。经我们向他解释“现在和从前不一样了”。以后，他气愤的说：你说这话我心中直动，人家是石板压着，我是泰山，听到这话我只想圪动！
    梁二年说：他过去租种过村长的地，在去年干部洗脸擦黑时他给村长提意见说“你过去压迫过我”，村长记在心，趁梁二年老婆跳井自杀时，说梁二年逼死老婆，斗争了他二亩地、四间房、一处闲院。
    郭天亮是农会积极分子，去年给干部洗脸时，他和一个农民商量着给干部提意见，干部说他是“开小组会”，送到区上扣了十来天。（郭天亮谈）
    公安员权利大操纵农会；他看着谁不好就开除农会，他这样说：“谁不好就下了他的农会，这好比老子赶出儿子去，叫你受受再回来！”有一次下了三十多人的农会。郭广吉（原为贫农，现为新中农）好说干部的短处，就下过四次农会，老汉谈起来说：“我参加农会已‘四进四出’了。”张其善因公安员包庇地主张天祥的九只羊，提了意见，就给下了农会。张年泰、郭天亮都被下过农会。（郭广吉、张年泰、郭天亮等谈）——我们开始和群众谈时都不吭，问来问去，群众说：“怕上梁！”（吊起来）。
    （四）区村干部一气：来个干部一吃上村干部的拉面、羊肉圪塔就不吭了；区干部没有到贫雇家吃过饭（群众反映）。
    （五）政治主任歪曲土地法：二十九日晚上，村干由区上开会回来，召开农会全体会读土地法，他把贫农团念作“人民团”，并说“什么是贫雇呢，咱们到会的都是贫雇”。郭玉章同志（我们冀南银行武安支行检查贷款的干部）当天就向群众解释了不是“人民团”，是“贫农团”，并解释了啥叫贫雇。
    以上这些材料是我们在这十天贷款工作中听到的反映，多是和贫雇谈话中听到的。因任务是检查贷款，时间有所限制，并未作详细的调查对照。本想整理稿子寄去，又怕简单了弄不清，为此将这些原始材料寄上，如需登出，请摘录整理，否则转有关部门。想对工作定有一些帮助吧？
    象这样的材料如何整理才适合？报社的要求望有暇见告，以便以后照办。  
        此致敬礼

              裴璋、智勇、于志同志：
    你们这个材料写的很好；调查到什么材料，照事实写下来寄给我们就可以，不必拘泥什么形式。
    另外，前柏林村材料最后一段所说只用“比历史、比时光”的方式查阶级成份，是不妥当的，所以删去了。
