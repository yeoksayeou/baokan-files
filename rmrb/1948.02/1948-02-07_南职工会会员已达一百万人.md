Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Belgrade dispatch: The chairman of the Yugoslav United Trade Unions, Shari, recently published an article in the *Labor Daily* to commemorate the third anniversary of the union's founding. He stated that the union's membership has grown from 225,000 in early 1945 to the current one million. The trade union has played a great role in initiating and organizing labor competitions during the period of national economic recovery and development. In the first ten months of last year, workers and engineers across the country submitted 45,000 technical improvement proposals and inventions, of which 34,000 have been adopted by factories, saving 226 million dinars. Shari then listed the great achievements of the trade union in social insurance, worker recuperation, and cultural services last year, saying: "Last year, more than 17,000 workers recuperated in 24 sanatoriums. Once the sanatoriums and rest homes currently being built by the trade union are completed, they will accommodate 11,000 people. Thanks to the government's help, 850,000 workers and 330,000 staff members spent their summer holidays last year while continuing to receive their wages. The trade union currently has 205 large clubs and 1,160 reading rooms." Shari finally pointed out: The efforts of Yugoslav workers have won the warm sympathy of workers from all over the world, as evidenced by the visits of workers' delegations from many countries to Yugoslavia last year. The United Trade Unions will continue to strengthen its forces to strive for the solidarity of the world working class and to strengthen the struggle against imperialism and warmongers.
