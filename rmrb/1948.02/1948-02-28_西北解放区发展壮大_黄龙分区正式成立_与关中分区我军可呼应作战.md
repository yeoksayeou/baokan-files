Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, February 26th: The highest leadership organs of the Northwest Party, government, and military have formally announced the establishment of the Huanglong Sub-district, administering the eight counties of Hancheng, Heye, Chengcheng, Yijun, Zhongbu, Luochuan, Yichuan, and Huanglong. They have also appointed the responsible persons for the Party, government, and military in the sub-district: Qiang Zixiu, Secretary of the CCP Huanglong Prefectural Committee; Liu Wenwei, Deputy Secretary; Hei Zhide, Administrative Commissioner; Niu Shushen, Commander of the Sub-district; Wang Baoshan, Deputy Commander; Qiang Zixiu (concurrently), Political Commissar; and Qin Wushan, Director of the Political Department. The Huanglong area is strategically important, bordering the Yellow River to the east, the Xianyang-Yulin Highway to the west, Tongguan and Xi'an to the south, and Gulin and Fuxian of our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to the north. Since a part of our field army entered the area last October, it has begun to organize the people's armed forces and political power. After the establishment of the sub-district, it will, together with our protruding "pocket-shaped area," the Guanzhong Sub-district, sandwich and attack the Chiang-Hu bandit troops, and will play a more important role in the glorious war to liberate the Great Northwest in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, February 26th: The commander of the Guanzhong Sub-district, who has returned from the front line, recently told reporters about the guerrilla warfare situation in the area: Since the beginning of the border region's self-defense war, the Guanzhong local armed corps, guerrilla teams, and militia have crushed four "encirclement and suppression" campaigns by the Chiang-Hu bandit troops (a total of 18 brigades and 16 regiments, plus a part of the Ma bandits), wiping out more than 4,300 enemy troops. In the course of persisting in the war, the armed forces have expanded by two-thirds, the area of the liberated area has expanded by nearly one time, and the population has increased from 120,000 to 170,000. Currently, the area stretches for more than 400 li from Huaishuzhuang in the north to Jiantouzhen in the south, and about 200 li wide from Diantouzhen in the east to Shanhezhen in the west, like a wedge inserted from the middle of the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Xianyang-Yulin highways into the KMT-controlled Great Guanzhong. The area north of Jingyang and Sanyuan is less than 200 li from Xi'an at the nearest point, forming an advanced position for the liberation of the Great Northwest and seriously threatening the Chiang bandit's Weibei Plain and Xi'an.

　　西北解放区发展壮大
    黄龙分区正式成立
  　与关中分区我军可呼应作战
    【新华社西北二十六日电】西北党政军最高领导机关顷正式宣布成立黄龙分区，辖韩城、郃阳、澄城、宜君、中部、洛川、宜川、黄龙八个县治，并分别任命该分区的党政军负责人：中共黄龙地委书记强自修、副书记刘文蔚、行政专员黑志德、分区司令员牛书申、副司令员王宝珊、政治委员强自修兼任，政治部主任秦武山。黄龙地区形势险要，东界黄河，西临咸榆公路，南出潼关、西安，北与我陕甘宁边区的固临、鄜县接壤。自去年十月我野战军一部进入该地区后，即开始组织人民的武装和政权，分区成立后将与我突出的“囊形地带”关中分区，夹袭蒋胡匪军，今后在解放大西北光荣战争中将起其更重要的作用。
    【新华社西北二十六日电】自前线归来的关中分区司令员，顷向记者谈当地的游击战形势说：关中地方兵团和游击队民兵，从边区自卫战争开始以来，粉碎了蒋胡匪军四次“清剿”（四次使用兵力共达十八个旅又十六个团与马匪一部），歼敌四千三百余名，在坚持战争中，武装力量扩大三分之二，解放区面积扩展近一倍，人口由十二万增至十七万。现该区北起槐树庄南至健头镇长约四百多里。东从店头镇西至山河镇宽约二百里，如同一个楔子从西（安）兰（州）咸（阳）榆（林）两条公路中间插进蒋管区大关中。泾（泾阳）原（三原）以北地区距西安最近处尚不足二百里，形成解放大西北的前进阵地，严重威胁蒋匪渭北平原和西安。
