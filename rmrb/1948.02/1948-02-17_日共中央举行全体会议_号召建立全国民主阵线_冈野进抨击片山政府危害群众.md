    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: Tokyo dispatch from the "Akahata" newspaper states: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party recently held a plenary session, discussing the domestic political situation and the tasks of consolidating democracy and organizing a united front. It issued a statement calling on the people to establish a national democratic front to defend national independence and democracy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: Tokyo dispatch: JCP leader Okano Susumu recently fiercely criticized Katayama's supplementary budget proposal at a meeting of the Diet Budget Committee. Okano Susumu pointed out that the Katayama government's method of balancing the budget deliberately sacrifices the interests of the broad masses and places the entire burden of the economic crisis on the shoulders of the Japanese workers and peasants. He also revealed that Japan's inflation is worsening, and the amount of currency in circulation is increasing daily. The reactionary Japanese government not only did not try to alleviate this situation, but instead exacerbated it. Okano Susumu pointed out that when the Katayama cabinet passed tax increases and raised train ticket prices, postage rates, and telegram fees, it argued that there was no other source of revenue. But in fact, the Japanese government has always subsidized coal mine owners while selling coal to private companies at prices below the cost of production. For example, the state-owned railway paid 1,209 yen per ton of coal, but the Katayama government sold it to private companies at an official price of 800 yen per ton. As a result, the state-owned railway lost 6 billion yen, while private companies made huge profits. Okano Susumu concluded that the Japanese working people oppose the government's financial policy because it benefits monopoly capital. The Government Employees' Union Federation has mobilized 300,000 people to jointly protest the government's supplementary budget proposal.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th: According to a semi-official US news agency, United Press, Nanjing, February 9th: A high-ranking Chiang Kai-shek bandit official admitted that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government has "fully agreed" and "supported" its American masters' vicious plan to "revive the Japanese economy" and maintain its enormous war potential, restoring Japanese industry to the production level of 1930 to 1934, the eve of the "July 7th" Incident when Japan was actively preparing to launch a large-scale war of aggression against China. According to this plan, Japan will retain an annual steel production of 3.5 million tons; 75,000 tons of ammonia (nitrogen); 3.5 million tons of sulfuric acid; 85,000 tons of soda ash; 650,000 tons of caustic soda; 27,000 machine tools; 15,000 steel rolling mills; 2 million kilowatts of thermal power; 150,000 tons of shipbuilding; and 5 million tons of ship repair. United Press stated that Zhu Shiming, former head of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit delegation to Japan, also published an article in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Central Daily News on the 8th, reflecting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's consistent attitude with US imperialism on the Japan issue.

    【新华社陕北十四日电】东京讯；日共领袖冈野进日前在议会预算委员会会议上，猛烈抨击片山之追加预算案。冈野进指出：片山政府平衡预算的办法，是有意地牺牲广大群众的利益，将经济危机的整个担子压在日本工农大众身上。并揭露称：日本的通货膨胀愈加恶劣，纸币流通额逐日增加，日本反动政府不仅没有设法使之缓和，反而加重这种情况。冈野进指出：片山内阁通过增税及提高火车票价、邮资和电报费时，曾强词夺理，谓除此之外，别无财源；但事实上，日本政府始终一面以款项补助煤矿业主，一面又按低于生产成本的价格，将煤售予私营公司。例如：国有铁道付出的煤价是每吨一千二百零九日元，片山政府则以官价每吨八百日元卖给私营公司。结果，国营铁道亏空六十亿日元，而私营公司则盈利极大。冈野进最后称：日本劳动人民反对政府的财政政策，因其为独点资本谋利益，政府机关员工联合会已发动三十万人，联合抗议政府的追加预算案。
