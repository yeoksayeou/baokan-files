Lu Haoqin's Self-Criticism: Working Was For Becoming an Official

(An'yang native, middle peasant, attended primary school. Started working in '45, currently serves as the Party Secretary of the Second District.)

I joined the work force with the intention of becoming an official. When I initially handled affairs at the district level, I was cautious. However, in '46, after becoming a branch committee member, I felt I had power and began to seize things. For example, while working in × village, Liu Delin grabbed a silk belt. I reprimanded him, forbidding him from taking it, but eventually, I used it myself, thinking there was nothing wrong with using such a small thing. After becoming a political commissar, the idea of enjoying privileges intensified. To avoid walking, I used public funds to buy a new vehicle for my personal use. When the weather turned cold, I wanted to get a greatcoat. Hearing that the public mine policeman Zhang Yuanrui's coat was very good and cheap, I told Wu Hesong, "I'm giving you three days to get that coat back, whether he likes it or not." Because I was the political commissar, he had no choice but to give me the coat. I, a Communist Party branch secretary, was learning the bad habits of the Kuomintang, arbitrarily scolding and beating people, plundering things, losing the qualities of a Communist Party member, and damaging the Party's prestige.

In leadership relations, I often tried to overwhelm others and establish my privileged rule. Therefore, I combined factionalism with opposition to leadership. For example, when Comrade Li Zhen was the branch secretary, I often had disputes with him, accusing him of patriarchal rule, when in reality, I wanted him to submit to my opinions. When promoting cadres, I tried to promote those I had cultivated, who would listen to me. Later, three out of the six branch secretaries were from my village, leading to my personal monopoly at the branch committee meetings. When Gao Baozhong was the branch secretary, I isolated him. At this time, out of seven branch secretaries, four were from my village, and two were cultivated by me, so everything was done according to my wishes. Later, when I became the political commissar, all the power was in my hands. I ate good food and didn't go to the countryside, used the messengers as I pleased, sat in the district office, only moving my mouth and not my legs. No one dared to disobey my orders about who to send to which village.

After becoming the political commissar, I always wanted to establish my prestige in my village. Last year, during the summer tax season, I deliberately lowered my village's output so that the burden would be lighter than other villages. At the district burden meeting, people expressed dissatisfaction, saying, "Things cannot be handled fairly; if a village has a district cadre, even good land becomes bad land." Hearing this, I accused the cadres of Dongshui of retaliation and criticized them, suppressing everyone's dissatisfaction. In reality, I was harming the interests of the entire district to establish my personal prestige and develop village factionalism.

　　路好勤反省：工作是为了当官
    （安阳人，中农，上过小学。四五年参加工作，现任二区区委书记。）
    我参加工作是为了当官，开始到区上办事还谨慎，四六年当了分委，觉得有了权，就开始抓东西。如在×村工作时，刘德林抓了条绸腰带，我训了他一顿不准他要，最后我用了，心想这点小东西用了没啥。当了政委后，特权享受思想发展更厉害，为省得走路，就用公款买了个新车子自己使用。天气冷了想搞个大衣，听说公矿公安员张元瑞的大衣很好，又便宜，我就告吴合松说：“给你三天任务，把大衣拿回来，不管他愿意不愿意。”因为我是政委，只有把大衣让给我，我是个共产党的分委书记，却学习了国民党的坏作风，随便打骂人掠夺东西，失掉共产党员的品质，损害党的威信。
    在领导关系上常想压倒别人，树立我的特权统治。所以我就结合宗派反领导，如李珍同志当分委书记我就常和他闹纠纷，说他家长统治，其实是想让他服从我的意见。在提拔干部时，我尽量提拔我培养的人，好听我的话，后来六个分委中三个是我村的，形成分委会上我个人的包办。高保中当分委书记时，我是孤立他，这时七个分委，四个是我村的，两个是我培养的，也是我说怎样就怎样。以后当了政委，大权都掌在我手，吃好饭不下乡，通讯员由我使，坐在区公所，只动嘴不动腿，叫谁到哪村没有一个不听我的话。
    我当了政委总想在俺村树立我的威信，去年夏屯时，我故意降低我村产量，出负担比别村都轻，全区负担会上反映不满说：“事情就不能办公平，那村有区干部那村好地也就变成坏地了”。听了这话便说东水干部报复，批评了他们一顿，把大家的不满压下了，实际是我损害全区利益，树立个人威信发展村宗派。
