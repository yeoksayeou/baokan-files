    The Enemy Knelt Down!
    A Close-Up of the Capture of Xinlitun
    [Xinhua News Agency Northeast Front, 31st] Correspondent Wen Qing reports: "The enemy, like Sun Wukong, can't escape the grasp of our People's Liberation Army. Watch as the enemy's 26th Division is annihilated under our bayonets!" This was the bold statement made by the soldiers of a certain unit, who were tasked with the main attack in the Xinlitun campaign, on their combat competition documents. Before the attack began, many soldiers in this unit even wrote "See Blood with the Bayonet" on their rifles. As soon as the battle began, under the cover of intense artillery fire, they swept towards the enemy's lines like a whirlwind. In just over thirty minutes, they charged up the high slope, more than 200 meters outside Xinlitun, causing the Chiang bandit officers and soldiers to be terrified, kneeling down and kowtowing, surrendering all their weapons. When the reporter went to observe, he happened to encounter soldier Ma Yonglin escorting prisoners down the mountain. He told the reporter: "The plan to 'see blood with the bayonet' was wasted. As soon as you charged up to them, they knelt down and surrendered their guns." From the night of the 24th to the 25th, our Field Army completely cleared the outer strongholds of Xinlitun: the railway station, Gaoshan (High Mountain), and group fortifications. At 3:00 AM on the 26th, a certain unit of ours began attacking Bajiazi, east of the city. The surrounded Chiang bandits immediately showed signs of wavering. As soon as our artillery test-fired, they were so frightened that they lost their wits. Only one hour after the attack began, the enemy left a small force to cover their retreat, and the main force abandoned all their supplies and more than ten mountain and field guns, quietly slipping out of the city in three routes, fleeing in the northeast, northwest, and southwest directions. Unexpectedly, after fleeing only ten-odd li, they fell into our pre-set ambush circle, and by 10:00 AM, they were completely wiped out. Our attacking troops had, three hours earlier, cleared the remaining enemies in the city and completely occupied Xinlitun.

    敌人跪下了！
    攻克新立屯特写
    【新华社东北前线三十一日电】分社记者文清报导：“敌人是孙大圣也逃不出咱解放军的手心，看敌二十六师就在咱刺刀下歼灭”。这是此次新立屯战役中担任主攻任务的某部战士们在作战竞赛书上的豪语。当攻击开始前，该部许多战士还在枪杆上写着：“刺刀见血”的字样。战斗一开始，他们即在猛烈炮火掩护下，一阵旋风似的卷向敌阵，三十多分钟就冲上了新立屯外围二百多公尺的高坡，使蒋匪官兵心胆迸裂，纷纷跪下叩头，交出了全部的武器。当记者前往观察时，正遇战士马永林押解俘虏送往山下。他对记者说：“刺刀见红的计划算是白费了，你一冲到他们跟前，他们就跪下交枪”。我野战兵团从二十四日夜至二十五日一天中，完全扫清新立屯外围据点：车站、高山和集团工事。二十六日晨三时，我某部开始攻击城东之八家子，被围困的蒋匪立即呈现动摇，等我炮兵刚刚试射，就吓得他们丧魂落魄，攻击开始只一小时，敌即留下少数兵力掩护退却，主力即遗弃所有辎重及十余门山野炮，分三路悄悄溜出城外，向东北、西北、西南三个方向逃窜，不料逃出才十多里，又陷入我预设的伏击圈内，战至午前十时即全部覆灭，我攻城部队则在此前三小时，即肃清城内残敌，完全占领新立屯。
