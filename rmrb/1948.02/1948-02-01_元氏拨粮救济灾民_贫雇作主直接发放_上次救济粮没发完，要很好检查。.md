    Yuanshi Allocates Grain to Relieve Disaster Victims
    Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Take Charge of Direct Distribution
    Previous Relief Grain Was Not Fully Distributed, Requires Thorough Inspection.
    [Yuanshi News] In Yuanshi's fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, as well as the Chengguan New District, due to the poor start to this year, coupled with the disasters caused by the Chiang bandit Wei Yonghe, the broad masses, especially the poor peasants and hired laborers, have begun to go hungry. Although the previous relief effort was carried out, it is still not enough to survive and affects production to overcome the famine. In order to urgently aid the disaster victims, support the production of poor peasants and hired laborers, and overcome the famine, the government has specially allocated 400 shi of millet to relieve the poor people and disaster victims in Chengguan and the surrounding areas who have not yet turned over. To ensure that the relief grain truly reaches the hands of the poor peasants and hired laborers who have no way to live, the government and the Relief Association convened a representative meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers from the villages to be relieved (all upright and honest poor peasants and hired laborers) on the 18th of this month, with 217 people from 62 villages attending. Everyone took charge to discuss how to distribute the relief. It was clearly determined that in order to make the relief fair, it is necessary to convene an upright meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers to discuss and decide who should be allocated and who should not, entirely decided by the poor peasants and hired laborers, and no one can restrict or interfere. Whether village cadres and militia members should be relieved or not should also be entirely decided by the meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers, and no one should grab a handful or take more than their share. After the meeting, the representatives were all very happy and said, "In the past, no one looked up to us, but now we are going to be masters!" Several old men said, "We have lived such long lives, and we have never even entered the yamen. People often say: the yamen gate faces south, those with reason but no money cannot enter. We poor people cannot enter the yamen at all, but now it has become our yamen, calling on us to produce well and overcome this famine year." At the same time, the Special Commissioner's Office also sent several cadres to bring 10 million yuan in loans to lend to disaster victims in the New District for spinning, weaving, transportation, and small businesses, which must also be done through the poor peasants and hired laborers, and lent to the poor peasants and hired laborers.
    [Another Message] The poor people in Chengguan and the surrounding villages are hungry, and they cannot even get turnips to eat every day. However, it has recently been discovered that of the relief grain issued by the county government last time, 100 shi are still stored in the original village in Chengguan District, and 20 shi are stored in Xiguan and have not been distributed. Chengguan District should thoroughly investigate the reasons for this lack of concern for the suffering of the poor, conduct a profound self-criticism, and distribute this grain immediately.

    元氏拨粮救济灾民
    贫雇作主直接发放
    上次救济粮没发完，要很好检查。
    【元氏消息】元氏五、六、七区及城关新区，因今年年头不好，再加上蒋匪魏永和灾，广大群众尤其是贫雇已经饿起肚子。虽经过上次的救济，但仍不能过下去，影响生产渡荒。政府为了急救灾民，扶持贫雇生产，渡过灾荒，特拨谷子四百石，救济城关及城周没翻过身的贫民灾民。为使救济粮真正发到没法生活的贫雇手里，政府和救联会在本月十八日召开了应救济村庄的贫雇代表会（都是正派的老实贫雇），到会六十二村二百一十七人。大家作主商讨如何分配救济。明确确定了要想救济的公平，必须召开正派的贫雇会，讨论决定谁应分谁不应分，完全由贫雇作主，任何人不能限制干涉。村干部民兵该救济不该救济也完全由贫雇会来决定，不得抓一把或多分。会后各代表都很高兴的说：“过去没人看得起咱，现在要当家作主呀！”几个老头说：“咱活了这么大年纪，连衙门口没进过。人常说：衙门口朝南开，有理没钱进不来。咱穷人根本进不了衙门口，现在成了咱们的衙门口，叫咱很好生产，渡过这个荒年”。同时，专署也派几个干部带来一千万元贷款，贷给新区灾民纺织、运输、干小买卖，也一定要通过贫雇，贷到贫雇手里。
    【又息】城关及城周各村穷人饿着肚皮，每天连蔓菁还吃不到嘴里。但近来发现，上次县政府所发下的救济粮，城关区尚在原庄存着一百石，在西关存着二十石没发。这种不关心穷人痛苦的事，城关区应很好检查原因，进行深刻检讨，把这项粮食马上救济下去才好。
