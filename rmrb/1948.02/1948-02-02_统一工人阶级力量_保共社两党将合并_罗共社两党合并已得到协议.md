    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st: Sofia dispatch: Bulgarian Social Democratic Party Political Secretary Podurov announced at the party's Supreme Council meeting that the party's Central Committee had unanimously passed a resolution for the party to merge with the Workers' Party (i.e., the Bulgarian Communist Party) into a unified working-class party, and would submit this resolution to the Supreme Council for discussion. When Podurov made the announcement, the assembly responded with warm applause of heartfelt welcome. Party General Secretary Nikov, in his report to the assembly analyzing the domestic and international situation, also called on the assembly to authorize the Central Committee to negotiate merger matters with the Workers' Party. Nikov also vehemently denounced right-wing socialists headed by Blum, Bevin, Saragat, Schumacher, and others, who willingly act as pawns of American imperialist expansionist policies. Nikov declared: "The Bulgarian Social Democratic Party firmly stands on the side of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the great Soviet Union." Furthermore, according to a Bucharest dispatch: Negotiations that began at the end of last year between the Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party to merge into a unified Workers' Party have reached an agreement, and the national congress for the merger of the two parties is scheduled to be held on February 17th.

    【新华社陕北三十一日电】索菲亚讯：保家利亚社会民主党政治书记波杜洛夫，日前在该党最高会议上宣布：该党中央委员会已一致通过该党与工人党（即保共）合并为统一的工人阶级政党的决议，并将此一决议提请最高会议讨论。波氏声明时，大会报以衷心欢迎的热烈掌声。该党总书记尼柯夫在向大会作分析国内外形势的报告时，亦吁请大会授权中央委员会与工人党商谈合并事宜。尼氏并痛斥以勃鲁姆、贝文、萨拉盖特、舒马赫等为首的右翼社会党人，甘为美国帝国主义扩张政策之走狗。尼氏声称：“保加利亚社会民主党坚决站在以伟大苏联为首的和平民主与社会主义阵营方面”。另据布加勒斯特讯：去年底开始的罗马尼亚共产党与社会民主党合并成统一工人党之谈判，已获协议，并定于二月十七日举行两党合并的全国代表大会。
