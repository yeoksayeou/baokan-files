    The practice of the Changzhi City Post Office not being open for business during holidays and on Monday mornings and evenings is worth studying. Some people run from the West Gate to East Street to send letters, only to find the post office closed on Monday. Some matters require urgent attention, but the post office is closed and does not accept letters. I suggest that the Changzhi City Post Office could change its working system and adopt a rotating duty and shift system. Because the people do not have Sundays; they need to handle matters and send letters, and they will not necessarily handle things according to the rule that one must rest one day out of seven.

    邮局应该凑老百姓的时间
    长治市邮政局，每逢假日及星期一，早晚不办公，这样作很值得研究。有些老百姓从西关跑到东街送信，却遇到邮局是礼拜一，不办公，只得又跑回去。有些事情需要紧急办理，而邮局休息，不收信。我的意见希望长治市邮局可不可以把办公制度改变一下，采取轮流值日，换班休息制。因为老百姓并没有星期日，他们要办事，要送信，也不会按照七天中必得休息一天去处理。
