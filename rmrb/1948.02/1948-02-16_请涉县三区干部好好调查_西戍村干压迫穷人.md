    Please Comrades of the Third District of She County, Investigate Properly: Village Cadres of Xishu Village Oppress the Poor
    Farmers:
    Our newspaper welcomes everyone to denounce the crimes of the landlords here, expose shortcomings in our work, promote things that our farmers think are good and appropriate, and put forward your own demands and suggestions for improving our work. All institutions, organizations, and individuals mentioned by you must express their attitude. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to your opinions should accept them and act accordingly. If there are any inappropriate points, explanations can be made and different opinions can be put forward. If you can write, write it yourselves. If you can't, you can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write for you, or you can come to the newspaper yourself. If that doesn't work, write a letter to the newspaper to let us know, and we can figure out a solution. Editorial comrades are responsible!
    I was very saddened to read in the February 6th newspaper about Yang Xihe bullying people by relying on his power. I believe that in Xishu Village, Third District of She County, the masses are suffering greatly from the oppression of the cadres. The village chief is Jiang Haixin (a rich peasant), the political director is Zhang Liancheng (a former rich peasant), the public security officer is Wang Xianzhang (an old middle peasant), and the director of the armed forces committee is Lian Qinghai (an upper-middle peasant). During the famine years of '43 and '44, there was a poor peasant named Wang Shuyu, whose family had no food at all. After not eating for three days, he went to the field and stole two corncobs from a landlord. He was seen by the farmers' association director, Li Youyi (a former rich peasant), and Li Zhiguo, who brutally beat and hanged Wang Shuyu and then immediately executed him. I think Wang Shuyu could not bear the hunger, so he went to steal two corncobs to eat. If he were a landlord or a rich peasant, he wouldn't be hungry, would he go eat raw corncobs? Li Youyi also said that his stealing corncobs damaged the reputation of the farmers' association. Wang Xianzhang and Zhang Liancheng said: He should be executed. Also, Zhang Gaishun's wife went to the fields to dig for wild vegetables, and Jiang Haixin said she trampled the crops, so he hung her up and beat her, and also fined her a lot of money, which led to her and her husband divorcing. All this money was embezzled by these cadres. There is proof of this. Ask Wang Tianchang about the execution of Wang Shuyu and you will understand. It was necessary to force Gaishun's wife to divorce, and now Gaishun's wife is "seeing" Wang Laowu. Ask him and he will know. Last year, Wang Shuyu's son, Wang Youjin, joined the army and brought up the fact that the cadres had harmed his father. The cadres promised to erect a monument for Wang Shuyu, but after Wang Youjin left, they didn't do it. During the famine years, Jiang Haixin ate meat and noodles every day and had affairs with women. Wang Xianzhang used the special agent Wang Shuting to collect debts. The masses' opinions are proven by Lian Zhongyi. If you don't believe it, you can ask Lian Zhongyi and he will know. The common people don't dare to say anything. During the famine years, the cadres used public grain to buy land, buy sheep, and open restaurants, and no one dared to say anything. It was necessary to force Jiang Laoyuan to hand over public grain. Jiang Laoyuan sold his land to the cadres to offset the public grain. Forced to the point of no other option, Laoyuan gave the land to the cadres and fled to Shanxi. Ask Jiang Laoyuan and he will know. Some working comrades only listen to these cadres and don't ask the common people. The common people don't dare to speak out because they are afraid of the cadres taking revenge. Now that the poor peasants and farm laborers want to be masters of their own destiny, these bad cadres still want to intimidate people by relying on their power. Wang Xianzhang and Zhang Liancheng went to the Railway Bureau, and he said he was acting as some sort of "commissioner" (a big official). Lian Qinghai went to the De Tai Heng shop to be some sort of manager. Jiang Haixin went to the Party School to be some sort of administrator. He still uses these big words to intimidate the common people. I hope the comrades working in the Third District can investigate this properly, encourage the poor peasants to be bold and offer their opinions, and make these bad cadres thoroughly examine themselves, so that good and bad can be distinguished clearly. The bad cadres' embezzled fruits of the masses should be brought up by the masses, and they should be returned to the masses. The things bought with public grain during the famine years should also be returned. Furthermore, why haven't the poor peasants turned themselves around? Last year, when carrying out the movement, the political director, Zhang Liancheng, said: Whoever wants to struggle and offer opinions will be held responsible. If you struggle wrongly, you will have to give the rich man a big flag to support him. This sentence scared the masses so much that they didn't dare to offer many opinions against the rich. This was said openly in the farmers' association, and everyone knows it. In reality, he is protecting the rich. Now, the landlord Li Longkui thinks that the old cadres have already been removed, and no one will support him anymore, so he voluntarily took out more than ninety silver dollars. Why didn't he take it out during last year's movement? This proves that the cadres were protecting the landlords. These cadres also used many hoodlums to intimidate the masses, and also said that they and the workers were on good terms. The masses said behind their backs: "It turns out the cadres can eat openly, they are originally officials protecting each other." But now the Land Law outline is to elevate the poor, the masses' bitterness must be poured out, to complain is to be done with it. The bad deeds of these cadres cannot be finished in one sitting, let the masses bring it up and let them examine themselves. There are some other things I would also like to bring up. Four years ago, the cadres confiscated more than two thousand yuan from the poor peasant Li Ergou, and didn't allow Ergou to tell anyone about it. Ask Ergou and he will know the details. I will talk to you comrades again when I think of something else!

    请涉县三区干部好好调查
    西戍村干压迫穷人农民们：
    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控拆地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。编辑负责同志们！
    我看到二月六日那天的报，说的是杨希和仗势欺人，我是非常痛心。我想涉县三区西戍村，群众受干部恨（很）大压迫。有村长江海心（富农）、证（政）治主任张连成（是旧富农）、公安员王献章（是老中农）、武委会主任连清海（是上中农），三十二、三年灾荒，有贫农王书玉，家中一个粮食赤（吃）食无有，三天未有吃饭，到地扒了地主二个玉交（茭），被农会主任李有义（旧富农）与李治国看见，将王书玉非形（刑）吊打一顿，立刻枪决死了。我想王书玉饥饿难应（忍），才去扒二个玉交（茭）吃。要是地主富农，他不饥，他也去吃生玉交（茭）？李有义还说他扒玉交（茭），是破坏了农会名誉，王献章、张连成说：应该枪决。还有张改顺妻去地挖（剜）菜，江海心说她踏了谷，将她吊打一绳，还法（罚）了她好多钱款，闹的她夫妻离婚了，这些钱完全是者（这）几个干部私吞了。此事都有证明，枪决死王书玉刻下问王天昌就明白了。立必（逼）改顺夫妻离婚，现下改顺妻与王老五“对相”（象）了，问他就知到（道）了。去年王书玉儿子王有金去参军，将干部害他父亲提出来了，干部许给王书玉立碑，王有金去后又不办了。过灾荒年江海心每天吃肉吃面（面）搞女人，王献章用的特务王书亭收仗（帐），群众意见有连仲义证明，如不信可去问连仲义就知到（道）了。老百姓谁也不敢坑（吭）。灾荒年干部拿公粮买地买羊开饭管（馆），谁也不敢坑（吭）。立必（逼）江老元交公粮，江老元将地买（卖）给干部顶了公粮，必（逼）的老元无法将地给了干部，往山西逃难去，刻下问江老元便知。有些工作员同志光听者（这）几个干部的话，并不问老百姓，老百姓也不敢说，都怕干部报伏（复）。现在贫雇农要当家，者（这）些坏干部还想仗势下乎（吓唬）人。王献章和张连成去铁路局，他说当什么兼伪（监委）（是大官），连清海去德太恒商店当什么经理，江海心去党校当什么管理员，他还是拿这些大话下乎（吓唬）老百姓。我希望在三区工作同志可好好吊（调）查一下，要叫贫农但（胆）大来提意见，要叫者（这）些坏干部好好检讨，好坏要分青（清）。坏干部贪污的群众果食（实）叫群众提出来，他应当退还群众，灾荒年使公粮买的群众东西，叫他也可退还。再说为什么贫农没有翻了身？去年搞运动，政治主任张连成说：谁要斗争提意见谁赴（负）责任，斗惜（错）了还得给老财扶杆大旗。者（这）句话郝（吓）的群众也不敢与老财多提意见了。此话是在农会里公开说来，每个人都之（知）道，十（实）记（际）是他包皮（庇）老财。现时地主李隆魁想的旧干部已今（经）换吊（掉）了，也无人与他作主了，他又自动拿出现洋九十余元。为什么去年运动他不往外拿？者（这）就是证明是干部包皮（庇）地主。者（这）些干部还利用好多流氓威郝（吓）群众，还说我与工作员都是相好，群众被（背）地说：“该还是干部能吃开了，原是官官相会（卫）。”不果（过）现在土地法大缸（纲）是提高贫人，群众苦水一定要倒出来，要树树（诉诉）苦就算完了。者（这）些干部的坏事一时说不完，叫群众提出，叫他自己检讨。还有一些我亦提出，前四年干部没收了贫农李二狗款二千余元，还不叫二狗对人说，问二狗便知详细。我以后想其（起）来与你们同志在（再）谈吧！
