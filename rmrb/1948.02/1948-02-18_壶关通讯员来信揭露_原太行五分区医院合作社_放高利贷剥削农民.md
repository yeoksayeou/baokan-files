    Letter from a Correspondent in Huguan Exposes the Former Taihang Fifth Sub-district Hospital Cooperative for Exploiting Peasants with High-Interest Loans
    [This Newspaper's News] Four comrades, Guo You, Chang Ji, Wen Fu, and Liang Yu, correspondents in Huguan, revealed in a letter to this newspaper on the 14th the illegal behavior of the former Taihang Fifth Sub-district Hospital Cooperative in exploiting peasants with high-interest loans, requesting the responsible parties to quickly investigate and resolve the matter. It is said that:
    Hospital No. 1 of the Fifth Sub-district Hospital was previously stationed in Qiaoshang Village, Sixth District of our county, and brought with it a production cooperative. Later, the hospital left, but the cooperative remained in Qiaoshang Village for production. We do not have detailed knowledge of which organ or troop is now leading them. We only know that they were originally led by the Fifth Sub-district, so we are making a suggestion to the Fifth Sub-district. Even if they are not led by the Fifth Sub-district, you can convey our thoughts to their directly subordinate troops for resolution. This cooperative has no business relationship with the masses; it only sells consumables and does not have the necessities for the peasants. The way they do business is just a facade; their main activity is lending money (at high interest rates). For every yuan lent, the monthly interest is twelve cents per yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of twelve percent. According to our understanding on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, they had lent out 950,000 yuan in Qiaoshang and Wangjia Village alone. Many people reflected that the interest was too high and was draining them dry. A cadre from Shihemu once proposed: "They are also engaged in production, and both sides (peasants and the hospital cooperative) should benefit. The interest is too high, and we request the higher authorities to negotiate..." We accepted the feedback from the masses at the time and made a well-intentioned proposal to the cooperative's manager, Guo. He didn't say anything on the surface, still using the rhetoric of supporting the masses' production to deal with us. However, that same night, he sent people to Wangjia Village to force the cadres and masses to pay back the money, even demanding that they immediately sell their mules to pay the money. The small cooperative in Shizui Village was completely ruined by this cooperative. The Shizui Village cooperative borrowed 160,000 yuan from them around the tenth day of the fifth lunar month last year, and by the beginning of the eighth lunar month, they had paid interest three times, each time with compound interest. Originally 160,000 yuan, the first time they couldn't afford to pay the interest, so it increased to 198,400 yuan. The second time they couldn't afford to pay the interest again, so they drew up another contract for 26,000 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of twelve percent. The third time, they had to pay 50,000 yuan in interest. As a result, in three months, the 160,000 yuan, with principal plus interest, earning interest on interest, rolled over to 274,400 yuan. In the end, the cooperative didn't have enough to pay back the hospital cooperative, so they had to sell everything to repay their debt. We believe that such management is extremely inappropriate, and the leadership must quickly correct it.

    壶关通讯员来信揭露
    原太行五分区医院合作社
    放高利贷剥削农民
    【本报消息】壶关通讯员郭有、常吉、文付、良玉四同志在十四日给本报来信，揭露原太行五分区医院合作社用高利贷剥削农民的非法行为，要求负责方面赶快检查解决。据说：
    五分区医院一所，前在我县六区桥上村驻扎，并带有一个生产合作社。后来医院走了，合作社仍留桥上村生产。现在归哪个机关部队领导，我们并不详细了解。我们只是知道他们原由五分区领导，因之我们向五分区建个议，就不是五分区领导，你们也好转达他们直属部队想法解决。该合作社在业务上给群众毫无关系，净卖消耗品，没有农民的必需品。他们搞业务是个样子，主要是放帐（高利贷）。贷出一元钱，每月每元利钱一毛二分，合月利十二分。根据我们去年腊月二十四日了解，光在桥上和王家庄两个村，就放了九十五万元。好多群众反映利太大，把咱背干了。石河沐干部曾这样提出：“他也是搞生产，应该两下（农民和医院合作社）赚开，利太大，要求上级给交涉一下………”我们当时接受了群众的反映，给该社郭经理善意的提出时，他表面上亦没说啥，还是以扶助群众生产的论调应付我们。可是当天黑夜，即派人到王家庄逼着干部群众要款，甚至就得马上卖了骡子交款。石嘴村的小合作社，完全被该合作社背倒了。石嘴村自去年五月初十贷他款十六万元，到八月初几就上了三次利，每次都是利上加利。原本十六万元，第一次上利不起，就增成十九万八千四百元，第二次上利又上不起，又给立二万六千元的一张契纸，每月十二分行息，第三次就出了五万元利钱。结果十六万元钱，三个月时间，本上加利，利上赚利，滚到二十七万四千四百元，最后合作社连本带利不够医院合作社的了，只好全部收拾还了人家饥荒。如此经营，我们认为极不妥当，领导方面必须赶快纠正。
