    On the Principle-Mindedness of Bolsheviks
    By Lan Lieboju
    Translated by Ya Tianer
    Lenin and Stalin taught us that a principled policy is the only correct policy, and our party cannot tolerate the slightest wavering or unprincipled behavior. It requires our staff to consistently complete their tasks without compromise and to always stand in the position of political activists.

    Bolshevik principle-mindedness is the spirit of irreconcilability towards any tendency that deviates even slightly from the party's principles, ideology, and policies. The party's policies are the source of life for the Soviet system. Party workers should use the party's policies as a guide to action in all their work, whether big or small, and proceed from a politically principled line.

    Lenin taught us that politics starts from matters related to the interests of millions of people; it is to treat problems politically in a principled way. That is, to observe problems from the perspective of millions of people and their interrelationships. This cannot allow for the slightest compromise in the face of local, parochial, or friendly relationships. Bolsheviks value friendship and comradeship. However, they believe that the highest standard for evaluating a person's behavior is to see how that person treats the interests of the people, as represented by the Soviet state.

    Lenin wrote: "We recognize the obligations between comrades, the obligation to help all comrades, the obligation to listen patiently to the opinions of comrades; but for us, the obligations between comrades arise from the obligations to Russia and the world social democracy, and cannot be reversed." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 2, pp. 541-542)

    From this, it can be seen that educating cadres in the spirit of principle-mindedness means that cadres must not proceed from personal or local interests when deciding any issue, but from the interests of the state. Uphold these interests in all circumstances and fight against anti-state tendencies. The Bolshevik principle-mindedness of each staff member is reflected in their attitude towards the work they undertake, and their principle-mindedness is checked by whether they subordinate their work to the major political tasks of the state and locality. The standard for evaluating all measures is: do these measures consolidate or weaken our great cause; do they promote the continued development of this great cause, or do they hinder its development? This should also be used as a standard for measuring the Bolshevik principle-mindedness of all staff members.

    Reality is proving that the inability to correctly judge various phenomena and the inability to treat problems in a principled way will result in serious losses. Take the mistakes made by the editorial departments of the two magazines "Star" and "Leningrad" as an example—these mistakes were exposed by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in a timely manner. What was the essence of these magazines' mistakes? It lies in the fact that the leading staff of the two magazines "Star" and "Leningrad" did not base their relationship with literary workers on the interests of correctly educating the Soviet people and politically guiding the activities of literary workers; instead, they based their relationship with literary workers on personal and friendly—that is, vulgar—interests. Because they were unwilling to break their friendships, they did not criticize worthless, anti-artistic, and politically detached works; because they were afraid of offending friends, they published very inappropriate works. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stated: "This kind of liberalism sacrifices the interests of the people and the state, the interests of correctly educating our youth, to friendly relationships; it blocks criticism, and as a result, writers stop continuing to improve themselves and lose their sense of responsibility to the people, the state, and the party. They also stop moving forward!" Or let us take a look at the facts of flattery towards foreigners. It is clear that some of our backward intellectuals have still not gotten rid of this shameful problem. Some party and economic leaders do not educate people in the spirit of Soviet national pride, but instead compromise with the facts of obsequiousness and servility towards foreigners. Is this not a manifestation of unprincipled behavior? This shows that it is necessary to demonstrate principle-mindedness in all matters, and that a politically-minded attitude in party work—is the basic attitude in party work. Comrade Stalin taught us that: "The foundation of the life and work of the party does not lie in the organizational forms that the party has adopted or can adopt at that time, but in the party's policies and its domestic and foreign policies." (Lenin and Stalin on Party Building, Vol. 2, p. 419). This means that our staff members should not only be good organizers and skilled practical workers, but also politically mature and ideologically firm people.

    Profound thought and a firm belief in the correctness of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism are the foundation of Bolshevik principle-mindedness. Only those who are firm in principle and have a good grasp of Marxist-Leninist thought can have the fighting Bolshevik principle-mindedness and treat problems from the principled standpoint of the party.

    Marxist-Leninist theory gives cadres a bright future and gives them confidence in their work. This theory develops their talents, enabling them to see the big picture from small things; to feel that they are fighting for a great ideal in their daily and immediate work; conversely, an attitude of indifference to theory will make them lose their future. Regarding those who are indifferent to theory, Comrade Stalin said that they have changed from political activists to political philistines, to unprincipled and apolitical pragmatists.

    Comrade Stalin said: "Regarding these vacillating people, the great Russian writer Gogol once said quite pertinently: 'Those who have no fixed ideas are neither this nor that, anyway you can't understand what kind of people they are, they are simply neither fish nor fowl.'" (Lenin, Stalin on Party Building, Vol. 2, p. 690).

    Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory is the method of educating our cadres ideologically and in principle, and it is also the most important method of improving their combat effectiveness. The great ideas of Marxism-Leninism are the living source of the spiritual strength of our cadres, the living source of the determination of cadres and their inexhaustible energy in overcoming difficulties. Practical experience proves that people who are ideologically developed are also powerful in practice, they have greater confidence in their work, temporary setbacks cannot discourage them, and they move forward firmly towards their established goals. It is precisely for this reason that the party requires our cadres to systematically and diligently engage in self-study in order to master Marxist-Leninist theory.

    Bolshevik principle-mindedness is an intolerance of all shortcomings, and it is cultivated in a highly serious situation. Regarding educating cadres in the spirit of principle-mindedness, no matter how much one talks about it, if the party committee does not show sufficient seriousness and indulges the mistakes of staff members, it will cause serious harm to the Bolshevik cadre education. For example, this practical situation exists in the Voroshilovgrad Provincial Party Committee. Not long ago, representatives of the State Planning Commission exposed the fact that the "Krasnoluch Coal Mine" Trust and the "Kadiev Coal Mine" Trust had overreported the amount of coal mined in the mines. He notified the leading comrades of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Provincial Committee, and it was estimated that it would be dealt with. However, the Provincial Party Committee did not show sufficient principle-mindedness, did not pay attention to the actions of the leaders of the two enterprises in violating the interests of the state, and did not subject them to punishment.

    To be a principled person means to not be afraid of offending anyone and to frankly and sincerely point out their shortcomings. Leaders should be good at "expressing their opinions with all the frankness inherent in Bolsheviks...," "as clearly and openly as Bolsheviks..." (Stalin on the Problems of Leninism, 11th edition, pp. 398, 144). At the same time, a principled person is not afraid of courageous, frank, and objective criticism himself.

    Criticism is the soul of the Bolshevik cadre education method. An staff member's principle-mindedness can also be tested by his attitude towards criticism. An staff member cannot regard Bolshevik's beneficial criticism as an insult to himself, as damage to his prestige, and therefore put self-esteem above the interests of work. He should have the courage to criticize others and also be good at accepting criticism bravely. (⑴⑵)

    "Any organization, without criticism, will become corrupt. Without criticism, any problem can penetrate deep into the marrow and be difficult to treat. Only bold and open criticism can help people become more and more perfect, can promote people to move forward, and overcome shortcomings in their work. Where there is no criticism, it will rot and mold from the roots, stop moving forward, and there is no possibility of progress." (Zhdanov)

    Unfortunately, there are still some staff members whose intolerance of criticism even threatens to retaliate against so-called "bullies," and sometimes they actually threaten to do so. As an example, Comrade Ivanenko, a party member, and some other comrades correctly criticized some serious shortcomings in the work of the dispatching office of the Moscow-Kursk Railway and Comrade Smirnov, the director of the office. Smirnov did not listen to the criticism and correct the serious shortcomings in his work in the spirit of Bolshevism. Instead, he removed Comrade Ivanenko's job. Even after Ivanenko was reinstated to his job by order of the ministry, Smirnov forcibly reduced her job position. According to her specialty, she was originally an engineer, but now she was asked to be a statistician. What is strange is that the leaders of the railway bureau's party organization turned a blind eye to this and, in fact, condoned Comrade Smirnov's incorrect actions.

    The existence of such a situation of solving problems by handling household affairs is not allowed. Solving problems without criticism and self-criticism hinders the exposure and correction of shortcomings and is harmful to the education of staff members as political activists.

    What are the consequences of a lack of principle-mindedness and the absence of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism? In the example of the Kurgan Provincial Party Committee, it can be seen very clearly: Comrade Sharapov, the former secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, replaced the party's principle-mindedness in his work with friendly relations. A harmonious and complacent atmosphere formed in the Provincial Party Committee, and indiscipline and dissoluteness appeared among the party and Soviet activists. Comrade Sharapov himself did not care about his work, and there were such situations: when the rural work was in full swing, he went to visit his friends and acquaintances! What were the results? As a result, the sowing in many areas of the province was not carried out well, and the work of harvesting and paying grain was also not prepared well. The members of the Provincial Party Committee were aware of all these situations, but they did not oppose this non-Bolshevik habit cultivated by the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee. This showed that they were unprincipled people, philistines rather than political activists.

    Unprincipled staff members often lose their independence and initiative and pursue material enjoyment. Staff members who are tied up lose the possibility of criticizing others. The members of the Kurgan Provincial Party Committee showed a lack of principle-mindedness in their many relationships with the Provincial Party Committee, because some of them had repeatedly received bonuses on the proposal of Comrade Sharapov. This was also one of the reasons why they forgave each other's mistakes.

    Unprincipledness and vulgarization are often the result of not adhering to the Bolshevik principles of selecting and distributing cadres. Comrade Stalin taught us to select cadres according to political standards—that is, to see whether the staff member is politically reliable, and also according to professional standards—that is, to see whether he is suitable for such a specific job. Wherever these principles are violated, wherever cadres are selected only based on family, vulgar, and friendly relations, regardless of whether they are politically and professionally suitable, there will be favorable conditions for flattering and protecting shortcomings in their work. What is obtained is not a leading core based on principles, "not a responsible leading group, but a small family of close people, but such a combination, its members all strive to live in peace, not offend each other, not wash dirty linen in public, and brag to each other..." (Stalin).

    In this case, there is no question of a high degree of seriousness towards staff members. In Ulyanovsk, there are many facts that show serious shortcomings. For example, the city management is ignored, the residents often have no lights, tap water is sometimes available and sometimes not, and the streets are full of dirty things. Comrade Deringeyev, the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, turned a blind eye to this and showed a liberal attitude towards the culprits of dereliction of duty in city management. All this is because Deringeyev had previously worked in the Far East. At that time, he brought with him several staff members who were "suitable" for him to Ulyanovsk. Now he has not shown a sufficient objective attitude towards the work of these people, and because of friendship, he has forgiven them in every possible way!

    Ideological education of cadres is our current major task. New cadres are constantly growing up, and they must be educated with Bolshevik traditions, developing their good character and qualities. A high degree of principle-mindedness and theoretical nature are the outstanding characteristics and most important qualities of Lenin-Stalin style staff members. Educating cadres with principle-mindedness and the determination to overcome difficulties will promote the more successful realization of the tasks of the new five-year plan and the task of building communism in our country.

    论布尔什维克的原则性
    蓝列波巨作
    亚天贰译
    列宁和斯大林教导我们说，原则性的政策是唯一正确的政策，我们的党不能容忍有丝毫的不坚定性与无原则性的表现。要求我们工作人员能经常不打折扣的完成自己的任务；经常站在政治活动家的岗位。
    布尔什维克的原则性，就是对一切稍微脱离党的原则思想和政策的倾向之不可调和的精神。党的政策是苏维埃制度之生命的源泉。党的工作者，在自己一切大小工作中应以党的政策为行动指南，从政治的原则性的路线出发。
    列宁教导我们说，政治是从联系到千百万人民利益的事情出发；是原则地从政治上去对待问题。就是说，要从千百万人及他们之间相互关系的观点来观察问题。这就不能在本位主义的地方性的朋友关系等利益面前作丝毫的让步。布尔什维克重视友情、同志关系。但是，他认为评定一个人行为的最高标准，是看这个人如何对待由苏维埃国家所代表的人民利益。
    列宁写道：“我们承认同志间的义务，承认有援助一切同志的义务，承认有耐心听取同志意见的义务；但对我们来说，同志间的义务是从对俄国的、和世界社会民主党的义务产生出来的，不能把它颠倒过来”。（列宁全集二卷五四一——五四二页）
    由此可见，在原则性的精神上教育干部，这就是说，必须作到在决定任何问题时，干部不是从私人的或地方的利益出发，而是从国家的利益出发。在一切场合坚持这种利益，并与反国家的倾向作斗争。每个工作人员的布尔什维克的原则性，表现在他对自己所担负的工作之态度上，而检查他的原则性，就看他是否把自己的工作服从于国家当地的重大政治任务。评定一切措施的标准是：这些措施是巩固还是削弱我们的伟大事业；促进这件伟大事业的继续发展，还是妨碍其发展。这一点也应作为测量一切工作人员之布尔什维克原则性的标准。
    现实在证明着不善于正确判断各种现象，和不善于有原则地对待问题，会受到严重的损失。拿“星”及“列宁格勒”两杂志编辑部所犯的错误为例来说——这些错误被联共中央及时地揭发了。这些杂志的实质在什么地方呢？就在于“星”和“列宁格勒”两杂志的领导工作人员，不是把正确的教导苏联人民、和政治上指导文学工作者的活动的利益，作为对待文学工作者的关系之依据；而是以私人的朋友的——就是说庸俗的利益，为其对待文学工作者的关系之依据。由于他们不愿意破裂朋友的关系，所以他们对没有价值的、反艺术的、脱离政治的作品不作批评；由于他们害怕得罪朋友，便登载了非常不适当的作品。联共中央的决议里说道：“这种自由主义，把人民的与国家的利益，正确的教育我们青年的利益，作了朋友关系的牺牲品；它闭塞了批评，结果是作家们停止继续深造，丧失他们对人民对国家与对党的责任感。他们也就停止前进了！”或者我们再拿对外国阿谀逢迎的事实来看一看。很显然，我们一部分落后的知识分子，还是没有摆脱掉这个可耻的毛病。一些党的和经济的领导者们，不用苏联民族自豪的精神来教育人们，却对媚外的奴颜婢膝事实谋妥协，这还不是无原则性的表现吗？这说明需要在一切问题上表现原则性，在党的工作中，尤其必要从政治上处理问题的态度——是党的工作中的基本态度。斯大林同志教导我们说：“党的生活与党的工作之基础，不在于党在当时所采取的、或能够采用的那一些组织形式，而在于党的政策与党的对内和对外的政策”。（列宁斯大林论党的建设二卷四一九页）。这就是说我们的工作人员，应当不仅是好的组织者，熟练的实际工作者，而且也是政治上成熟、思想上坚定的人。
    深刻的思想，对马列主义伟大思想之正确性的坚定的信念，便是布尔什维克的原则性之基础。只有在原则上坚定不移，很好的掌握了马列主义思想的人，才能具有战斗的布尔什维克的原则性，才能从党的原则立场上去对待问题。
    马列主义的理论，给予干部以光明的前途，使他们在工作中具有信心。这种理论发展他们的才能，使其能从小的事情，看到大的事情；能从日常的眼前的工作中，感觉到是在为了伟大的理想而斗争；反之对理论上不关心的态度，便会使其失掉前途。论到不关心理论的人们时，斯大林同志说过：他们有从政治活动家，变成为政治上的庸人，变成无原则的脱离政治的事务主义者。
    斯大林同志说：“关于这种游离不定的人们，伟大的俄国作家果戈里曾颇中肯地讲过：‘那些没有定见的人物，是既非此又非彼，反正你不能理解他们是些什么人，简直是非驴非马。’”（列宁、斯大林论党的建设二卷六九○页）。
    精通马列主义的理论，乃是在思想上、原则性上教育我们干部的方法，同时也是提高他们战斗力的最重要的方法。伟大马列主义的思想，乃是我们干部精神力量之活的源泉，是干部之坚决性及其在克服困难中之不枯竭的精力之活的源泉。实际的经验在在都证明着思想开展的人们，在实践中也是有力量的，他们在工作中有更大的信心，暂时的失利不能使他们灰心，他们坚强地向既定的目标前进。正因为如此，党便要求我们的干部，有系统的努力地进行自我学习，以精通马列主义的理论。
    布尔什维克的原则性，是一种对一切缺点的不能容忍性，它是在高度严肃性的情况中养成的。关于以原则性的精神教育干部，尽管高谈阔论，但如果党的委员会不表现足够的严肃性，姑息地对待工作人员的错误，那么便会给布尔什维克的干部教育，招致严重的危害。比如在伏罗希洛夫格勒省党委中就存在着这种实际情况，不久以前国家计划局的代表，揭发了“克拉斯诺銮煤矿”托拉斯和“卡堂也夫煤矿”托拉斯两企业中多报矿井中采煤量的事实，他将这些通知了联共省党委的领导同志，据估计将会加以处理。但省党委没有表现出足够的原则性，没有注意两企业中领导者违反国家利益的行动，没有使他们受到处分。
    作一个有原则性的人，就是说不怕得罪任何人，而直爽地诚恳地指出他们的缺点，领导者应当善于“用布尔什维克所固有的那种全部直爽态度发表自己的意见………”，“象布尔什维克那样明白而公开………”（斯大林论列宁主义问题十一版三九八页一四四页）。同时有原则性的人，他本身也不怕勇敢的坦白的客观的批评。
    批评乃是布尔什维克干部教育方法的灵魂，在对批评的态度上，也可以检验一个工作人员的原则性，一个工作人员不能把布尔什维克的有益的批评，看作是对自己的侮辱，看作是对自己的威信的损害，因而把自尊心看得高于工作的利益，他应当有勇气批评别人，也善于勇敢地接受批评。（⑴⑵）
    “任何一个组织，没有批评的话，都会腐朽的，没有批评则任何毛病可以深入膏肓，较难治疗。只有大胆的公开的批评，才能帮助人们变得日益完善，才能促起人们前进，克服工作中的缺点。凡是没有批评的地方，那里便从根上腐烂发霉，停止不前，那里便没有可能前进”。（日丹诺夫）
    可惜还有一些工作人员，对批评的不能容忍态度，竟以报复所谓“欺侮者”相威胁，而有时竟然实际的威胁起来了。可举这样一件事实为例：党员伊万年科同志，曾同其他一些同志正确批评了莫斯科——库尔斯克铁路配车处的工作中的一些严重的缺点和该处处长斯米尔诺夫同志，斯米尔诺夫不去倾听批评与按照布尔什维克的精神改正工作中的严正缺点，反而把伊万年科同志的工作撤掉了，甚至当伊万年科奉部令恢复了工作之后，斯米尔诺夫却硬降低了她的工作职位，按她的专门技能，本是工程师，现在却要她当统计员。奇怪的是铁路局党组织的领导者们，对此熟视无睹，事实上是助长了斯米尔诺夫同志的不正确的行动。
    不能容许这样一种用处理家务事的办法来解决问题的情况之存在，没有批评与自我批评的解决问题，妨碍对缺点的揭发与纠正，对教育作为政治活动家的工作人员是有危害的。
    缺乏原则性，没有布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，有时会得到什么结果呢？在库尔罕省党委的实例中，可以看得很明显：该省党委的前任书记沙拉波夫同志，以朋友关系代替了工作中的党的原则性，省党委中形成了一种一团和气、泰然自若的风气，党的与苏维埃的积极分子中间，出现了无纪律性与放荡散漫的分子。沙拉波夫同志自己不关心工作，竟有这样的情形：当农村工作火热的时候，他却去找自己的朋友和熟人游逛去了！这样得到了什么结果呢？结果是该省许多区里播种进行得不好，收割与交纳粮食的工作也准备得很不好，省党委的委员们都知道这一切情形，但对省党委领导者所养成的这种非布尔什维克的习性，不进行反对，这样便表明了他们是无原则性的人，是庸人而非政治的活动家。
    无原则性的工作人员，其结果往往是失掉独立性与自动性，追求物质享受的工作人员，把自己束缚起来，失掉了批评别人的可能性。库尔罕省党委的委员们，在对省委有许多的关系上，表现了无原则性，就因为他们中间有一些人按着沙拉波夫同志的提议几度获得了奖金，这也是他们彼此互相原谅错误的原因之一。
    无原则性、庸俗化也常常是不遵守布尔什维克原则挑选与分配干部的结果。斯大林同志教导我们要根据政治的标准来挑选干部——就是说：要看该工作人员在政治上是否是可靠的，也要根据业务的标准——就是说：看他是否适于这样一种具体工作。凡是违反这些原则的地方，凡是挑选干部只根据家庭的、庸俗的、朋友的关系，不管他们政治上和业务上是否适当，那里便要替吹拍逢迎与在工作中互相包庇缺点造成有利的条件，得到的不是在原则基础上的领导核心，“不是负责的领导集团，而是亲近人们的小家庭，而是这样一种组合，它的组员都力求和平共居，彼此不相得罪，家丑不可外扬，互相吹嘘…………”（斯大林）。
    在这种情况下，根本谈不到对工作人员的高度严肃性。在乌梁诺夫斯克有很多事实表现出了严重的缺点，比如城市管理无人过问，居民们常常没灯光，自来水忽有忽无，满街是脏东西，省委书记德林吉也夫同志对此熟视无睹，对于城市管理失职的罪人，表现了自由主义的态度，这一切正因为德林吉也夫从前曾在远东工作，当时，他便随身把几个对于他是“合适”的工作人员，带到乌梁诺夫斯克来，现在他对于这些人的工作，也未表现出足够的客观态度，而因朋友关系，对他们就百般地原谅了！
    对干部进行思想教育，这是我们当前的重大任务，新的干部不断的增长起来，必须以布尔什维克的传统教育他们，发展其优良的性格与品质，高度的原则性与理论性，乃是列宁——斯大林式的工作人员之卓越的特点与最重要的品质，以原则性与克服困难的坚决性教育干部，将会促进更加顺利的实现新五年计划的任务，与在我们国家内建设共产主义的任务。（译自一九四七年九月二十五日真理报）
