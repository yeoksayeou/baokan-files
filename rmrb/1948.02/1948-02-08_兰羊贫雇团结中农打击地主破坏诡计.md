    【Xingtai News】The escaped landlords of Lan Yang Village in the Fourth District, upon hearing about the impending land redistribution, spread rumors to frighten the middle peasants, saying, "Isn't the land going to be taken from the middle peasants!" "Those households and farm laborers who have been thoroughly struggled against will take land from our land." Some middle peasants became frightened upon hearing this. Some wealthier middle peasants indulged in extravagant eating and drinking, saying, "In these times, it's best to eat and drink while you can." In response to these situations, farm laborers and middle peasants held a meeting to study the Outline Land Law, which reassured the middle peasants. The escaped feudal forces became anxious. Taking advantage of the difficulties faced by farm laborers during the Lunar New Year, they tried to buy off farm laborers, retired soldiers, and military dependents. Four or five escaped landlords lent grain to farm laborers for the New Year, and lent money to them to start side businesses. One landlord even used farm laborers to sell grain for him. Farm laborers and middle peasants held another meeting and exposed the landlords' plots. Now, the farm laborers and middle peasants of this village are still carefully guarding against the landlords' sabotage. (Song Shiqun, Yin Xuexin)

    兰羊贫雇团结中农打击地主破坏诡计
    【邢台消息】四区兰羊村的漏网地主，一听要平分，就造谣吓唬中农，说：“还不是从中农身上分土地！”“斗彻底了的户和雇贫，都从咱们地上来分。”有些中农听了，害起怕来。有的富裕中农大吃大喝，说：“这年月，吃点喝点算啦。”根据这些情形，雇贫农和中农开会，研究了土地法大纲，把中农的心安下了。漏网封建势力着了急，趁年关雇贫农困难，就收买雇贫农、荣退军人和军属。有四五户漏网地主，就借给雇贫农麦子过年，借钱当本搞副业。有一户地主还利用雇贫农给他粜麦子。雇贫农、中农又开会，把地主的诡计揭穿。现在这村的雇贫农、中农还在好好留心地主的破坏。（宋诗群、尹学信）
