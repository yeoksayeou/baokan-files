Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, February 14th: The Shijiazhuang Democratic Government, in order to support private factories in developing production, has instructed the Municipal Trading Company to exchange finished products with more than ten private iron factories, such as Yongqing and Xiemao, at discounted prices using raw materials in kind. This has been widely promoted, enabling the factories to accelerate their capital turnover and expand production. After the implementation of this type of transaction, according to statistics from Yongmao, Tongyixing, Tianxing, Hengfeng, and other five factories in just seven days, 5,650 iron pots and 200 loads of Western waterwheels and waterwheels with trailers were sold, totaling 105.04 million Jinchaji Border Region currency. The prices of the raw material objects paid to the factories by the Trading Company were lower than the market prices: for example, millet was priced at 1,100 per jin (catty) while the market price was 1,200, a bag of white flour was priced at 84,000 while the market price was 85,000, coke was priced at 250 per jin while the market price was 280, and Yangquan coal was priced at 330 per jin while the market price was 340. Factories could freely choose to receive raw materials or actual goods in cash.

    扶植私营工厂扩大生产
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】石家庄民主政府为扶植私营工厂发展生产，特由市贸易公司以实物原料从廉折价与私营之永庆、协茂等十余家铁工厂交换成品，广为推销，使各工厂得以加速周转经营，扩大生产。此种交易实行后，仅据永茂、同益兴、天兴、恒丰等五厂七天统计，即推销了铁锅五千六百五十个又二百驮，洋水车和带挂斗水车七十二辆，共合晋察冀边币一亿零五百零四万元。贸易公司付给工厂之原料实物，折价均较市价为低：如小米每斤市价一千二百元按一千一折合，白面一袋八万五按八万四折合，焦炭市价一斤二百八按二百五折合，阳泉炭市价一斤三百四按三百三折合。至于要现款原料或实物，可由厂方任意选择。
