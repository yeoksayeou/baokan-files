    Franc Devaluation

    The franc is the name of the money used in France, just like the American "dollar" and the British "pound" are used as a medium for exchanging goods.

    Devaluation policy intentionally lowers the value of a country's money compared to foreign money in order to cope with economic panic and facilitate large capitalists to earn more money and plunder more of the laboring people's blood and sweat.

    Since the First European War, this recent franc devaluation is the third time.

    After the First European War, the franc, pound, and dollar were originally on par. American, British, and French capitalists used imperial power to form three groups dominating world finance, in order to plunder the resources of weaker countries. But in 1928, the world economy entered a stage of great panic. Due to the exploitation and waste of the big capitalists, France's financial expenditure was insufficient, and the currency inflated sharply. The French economy was also heading towards collapse. At that time, the French rulers implemented a franc devaluation, reducing the gold content of the franc to one-fifth of the pre-war level (at that time it was still on the gold standard). As a result, the French market became more chaotic, prices soared, the national economy fell into bankruptcy, and the lives of the French people became difficult to sustain. Therefore, the French people deeply hated the franc devaluation.

    In 1933, in order to maintain the gold standard, France formed a gold bloc alliance with Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland, with the franc in a leading position. Later, because Britain and the United States abandoned the gold standard and implemented a "devaluation" policy to stimulate exports, it affected the French foreign market, causing capital outflow and imbalance of international payments. The annual income in 1935 was less than 5 billion francs, and the rulers filled this shortfall by issuing public bonds, thus increasing the burden on the people. Because of excess imports, capital outflow was triggered. In September 1936, the amount of gold stored in the Bank of France was only 5.2 billion francs, which was not enough to cover the amount of francs issued. In addition, the reactionary Laval government implemented a contractionary policy, tightening the national budget, reducing employee salaries and national living expenses, which increased the number of unemployed in France and made people's lives more difficult. Labor strikes surged, deepening the French economic panic. When the Blum cabinet was in power, it implemented an economic expansion policy, with "public construction" and "national defense construction" expenditures alone reaching 200 billion francs, which further increased France's import surplus. In the first half of that year (1936), the import surplus was 40 billion francs, double the import surplus in the same period of 1935, thus accelerating the outflow of French capital and increasing the amount of financial shortfall. When the French economy was on the verge of collapse, the French big capitalist rulers announced the abandonment of the gold standard and devalued the franc by about 30 percent. As a result, the goods of French big capitalists had the opportunity to be dumped in foreign markets, and they continued to obtain profits. However, the "devaluation" brought greater disasters to the French working people. The prices of domestic and imported goods rose, the purchasing power of the working people decreased, and it became more difficult to maintain their lives.

    The recent franc devaluation implemented by the French reactionary government is nothing more than a way for French big capitalists to seek profits during economic panic. But this time, the "franc" does not have the autonomy that the "franc" had during the previous two devaluations. Because the French reactionaries rely on the United States, the franc is only an appendage of the dollar. This franc devaluation was implemented by the French reactionary government following the instructions of American imperialism, in order to facilitate the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" in France. It is a condition agreed upon by the American and French reactionaries: the United States gives the French reactionary government "temporary assistance" (which actually makes France lose its independence), and the French reactionary government has to agree to lower the value of the franc to increase the purchasing power of the dollar, so that it can buy French factories and industrial raw materials very cheaply. In this way, France will completely lose its independence, and the reactionary government will become more of a slave to American imperialism. Because the reactionary government is attached to the United States, the franc devaluation cannot prevent the dumping of American goods in France, and the French people will suffer more from the exploitation of rising prices.

    This franc devaluation has been strongly opposed by the French working people and the petty bourgeoisie. The French people's movement is booming. As long as the French people unite and overthrow the reactionary government, this kind of reactionary plan of the American and French reactionaries cannot be implemented.

### 法郎贬值

    法郎贬值
    法郎是法国用的钱的名称，就同美国的“金元”、英国的“金镑”的作用一样，是法国人用来作交换商品的一种媒介。
    贬值政策是有意的使本国的钱的价值比外国的钱降低，以应付经济恐慌，便于大资本家赚更多的钱，更多掠取劳动人民的血汗。
    从第一次欧战后，最近这一次法郎贬值是第三次了。
    第一次欧战后，法郎、英镑、美元原是平行的。美、英、法大资本家利用帝国强权，形成支配世界金融的三个集团，以便于他们掠夺弱小国家的资源。但一九二八年时，世界经济步入大恐慌阶段，法国由于大资本家的剥削浪费，财政开支不敷，通货剧烈膨胀，法国经济也日趋崩溃。那时法国统治者就实行过一次法郎贬值，把法郎的纯金降低到战前五分之一（那时还是金本位）。结果，法国市场更加混乱，物价暴涨，国民经济陷于破产，法国人民生活难以维持，因此法国人民对法郎贬值，深恶痛恨。
    一九三三年法国为维持金本位，与意、荷、波、瑞等国组成金集团联盟，法郎居领导地位。后因英、美放弃金本位，实行“贬值”政策，刺激出口，影响法国国外市场，使法国资金外流，国际收支不平衡，岁入不足，一九三五年不足五十亿法郎，统治者以增发公债填补此不足之额，因此人民负担加重。因为入超，引起资金外流，一九三六年九月法兰西银行存金额，仅五百二十万万法郎，不足应付法郎发行之额，加以赖伐尔反动政府执行紧缩政策，紧缩国家预算，减低员工薪金及国民生计费，使法国失业者增加，人民生活愈加困难，工潮澎湃，加深法国经济恐慌。至勃伦内阁时，又实行经济扩张政策，仅“公共建设”、“国防建设”费就达二百万万法郎，又增加了法国入超数字，当年（三六年）上半年入超数为四十万万法郎，比一九三五年同期入超数增加了一倍，于是加速法国资金外流，财政上不敷之数增加，法国经济崩溃在即时，法国大资本家统治者们就宣布放弃金本位，并贬低法郎价值约为百分之三十。因此法国大资本家的货物得到倾销国外市场的机会，继续取得利润。但“贬值”带给法国劳动人民的是更大灾害，国内物品及输入品的物价上涨，劳动人民购买力降低，生活的维持更加困难。
    最近法国反动政府又实行法郎贬值，无非又是法国大资本家在经济恐慌时寻求利润的办法。但这次“法郎”却没有前两次贬值时的“法郎”有自主权了。由于法国反动派的依靠美国，法郎就只是美元的附属物。这次法郎贬值，是法国反动政府听从美帝的吩咐而实行的，是为了便于“马歇尔计划”在法国实行。是美法反动派讲好了的条件，美国给法国反动政府以“临时援助”（实际是使法国丧失独立），法国反动政府就得答应把法郎价值降低，使美元的购买力增强，能够很便宜的购买法国的工厂和工业原料。这样，法国就将要完全丧失独立，反动政府就更成为美帝国主义的奴隶。因为反动政府依附美国，法郎贬值也不能阻止美货在法国的倾销，法国人民将更受物价上涨的剥削。
    这次法郎贬值已遭到法国劳动人民及中小资产阶级的强烈反对，法国人民运动正蓬勃发展，只要法国人民团结一致，打垮反动政府，美法反动派这类反动计划也就不能实行了。
