    Resisting Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Forced Grain Requisition
    Over Sixty Villages in Yuanwu Armed to Resist Chiang Kai-shek
    People Behind Enemy Lines in Jiaozuo and Yexian Defend Themselves Empty-Handed
    [Report from our newspaper] During the Lunar New Year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits intensified their grain requisition. In Yuanwu, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits sent a company of armed troops to the Bailiushu Village area to forcibly requisition grain, inciting resistance from local farmers. They beat the grain requisitioning Chiang Kai-shek bandits to a pulp, killing and wounding thirty people, while several civilians were injured. Subsequently, Chiang Kai-shek's Commissioner Zhang Jingzhong personally led a battalion of bandit soldiers to suppress the people. The people united sixty villages in time and repelled them again, wounding eight enemy soldiers. The third time, bandit leader Zhang Jingzhong sat in two cars and a tank to "negotiate peace," saying that military grain was not needed for the time being. The masses replied to him: If you don't want it, then that's fine; if you want it, we'll fight again! (Yueming)
    [Report from Taihang] In the Chiang Kai-shek bandit-controlled areas of Jiaozuo and Yexian, the people of two villages, unable to bear the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, rose up to defend themselves empty-handed. On January 28th, two plainclothes special agents from the Jiaozuo Chiang Kai-shek National Defense Department's Intelligence Group robbed people on Qilu Road outside the city, encountering four civilians from ×× Village (Chiang-occupied area) who were driving four carts loaded with grain back from Xiuwu. The two special agents saw an opportunity to make a fortune and immediately stepped forward to stop them and search their pockets. In addition to robbing them of 1.6 million 法币, they also untied four animals and wanted to take them all away. The four civilians, seeing that their lifeline was being taken away, rushed forward and pinned down the two special agents and beat them severely. One of them found an opportunity to escape, while the other was beaten until his head was bleeding. In the end, the civilians took back their belongings and captured a ten-shot short rifle with three bullets, returning victoriously. On the same day, several soldiers from the Chiang Kai-shek 40th Division in Yexian went to ×× Village (Chiang-controlled area) to loot grain. Wang Kao's wife had just sold a bolt of cloth and exchanged it for three catties of rice, which was also robbed, driving her to death out of anger! Wang Shun's wife was grinding noodles on the millstone, and the noodles were also robbed; when several civilians were outraged and hit a bandit soldier with a brick, the rest were frightened and ran away.

    反抗蒋匪强迫征粮
    原武六十余村武装抗蒋
    焦作邺县敌后人民徒手自卫
    【本报消息】旧历年关蒋匪征粮更甚。原武蒋匪，因派一连武装去白柳树村一带强迫征粮，逼起当地农民反抗，将征粮蒋匪打得落花流水，打死打伤三十人，老百姓有数名负伤。随后蒋匪专员张敬中竟亲率匪兵一营前去镇压，老百姓及时团结六十余村，又将其击退，伤敌八名。第三次匪首张敬中坐两辆汽车、一辆坦克前去“讲和”，说军粮暂且不要。群众答复他：你不要就算了，你要咱们就再打！（曰明）
    【太行消息】焦作邺县蒋匪统治区两个村的老百姓，受不了蒋匪的压榨，赤手空拳起而自卫。一月二十八日，焦作蒋匪国防部情报组便衣特务两名，到市外汽路上打劫，遇着××村（蒋占区）四个老百姓赶着四辆车，拉着粮食由修武返回。两个特务一看有了发财的机会，即上前阻拦搜索腰包，除抢去法币一百六十万元，还将四头牲口解下要一齐拉走。四个老百姓一见把命根抢走还能活，即一齐扑上，将两个特务按倒痛打，其中一个瞅空逃跑，一个被打得头破血流，最后老百姓将自己东西夺回，并缴获十子连短枪一支，子弹三发，胜利返回。同日，邺县蒋匪四十师数名到××村（蒋统治区）抢粮；王靠的老婆刚卖了一丈布换了三斤米也被抢走，逼得她活活气死了！王顺老婆正在碾子上碾的面也被抢走；当有几个老百姓气愤不过，即用砖头打倒一个匪军，其余都吓跑了。
