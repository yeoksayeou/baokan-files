　　Landlord elements in Shi'er Village seized the opportunity to infiltrate the Party
  　Controlling the branch and oppressing the peasants
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Shi'er Village branch in the ninth district of Wu'an has been around for nearly ten years. When the branch was first established, it led the masses to fight against the Japanese invaders and landlords, but its work style was very undemocratic. Later, bankrupt landlords and ruffians infiltrated the branch, causing serious impurity within the Party. They provoked the branch to suppress the peasants, and some party members who were essentially good were also negatively influenced by them. The general situation of Shi'er Village and the situation of the branch are reported as follows:
    Shi'er Village is a relatively poor village. To this day, the masses still circulate the saying: "If you want to eat noodles, go to Boyan; if you want to eat bran, go to Shi'er Village." The whole village has 296 households, 1,007 people, and 35.24 hectares of land, averaging 0.23 hectares per person, with an average yield of 510 kg. Compared with nearby villages, the quantity and yield are both lower. The soil is rocky and thin, surrounded by sandy and rocky mountains. There is a lot of hillside land. When it rains, the land is covered with a layer of sand. The masses say: "The land of Shi'er Village is hanging on the walls." This kind of land produces less grain and requires a lot of wasted work. Every winter, in order to accumulate fertilizer, the white grass roots in the mountain gullies have to be scraped clean.
    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the village sent 180 long-term laborers to the bottom of the slope (east of Tanling), mostly to Zhouzhuang, which was once known as Little Shi'er Village. Even now, there are still 68 shop assistants and coolies isolated in Guandong (Manchuria), Tianjin and other areas, and there are still 137 old and young bachelors in the village.
    Before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were no landlords in the whole village who owned more than one hectare of land. The total number of hectares owned by the 29 landlord and rich peasant families did not exceed 6.6 hectares. However, the political and economic power was completely in their hands. Liu Zhengren and Wang Guoqing were their ringleaders. The masses said: "The two of them hold up half the sky of Shi'er Village."
    In the winter of 1938, the village had a secret Party group of four members. When preparing to establish a peasant association, the landlords established a fake peasant association first. In other villages, taxes were levied according to five grades, but this village still apportioned them as before, mostly on the poor. The landlords spread rumors that several poor peasant activists were lazy people, and turned their names into songs to sing in the streets: "Zhang Wansheng, Guo Peiyuan, worms in the nose (poor peasant Ren Xingliang had a nose problem) Lao Danian, Jin Wang, Humen doesn't touch the strings." One night, when the peasant association was established, Liu Zhengren and Wang Guoqing led a group of landlords into the venue and blocked the registration of names on the road. The first peasant association was thus dispersed by them.
    In the spring of 1939, the number of Party members increased to eleven, and the peasant association was re-established, followed by a struggle against Liu Zhengren because he colluded with the big traitor Li Pinshan to establish the "Autonomous Army" in Niuwangwa. All his family's movable property was confiscated. After this big boss was overthrown, the landlords' open political power was basically destroyed. Economically, through the investigation of black land in 1941, the liquidation of the agency heads' accounts (agency heads were all landlords taking turns), and the rent and interest reduction movement in 1942, a part of them was greatly weakened, and seven families completely collapsed. Some poor and hired peasants received a portion of grain and land, and some bought a portion of the landlords' land at low prices or pawned a portion of land.
    Although the new regime in the village was established relatively early, and the struggle against the enemy and the landlords was very resolute, its work style was extremely undemocratic, forming one-man rule. The power of the Party, government, and armed forces was completely in the hands of Guo Peiyuan, who came from a ruffian background. The masses said of him: "He looks down on both ends, looks down on the landlords and also looks down on the poor." Not only were the masses afraid of him, but even the cadres and Party members had to completely listen to his instructions. Whoever disagreed with him was kicked out. Honest peasant Party members were expelled from the Party, and bankrupt landlords, ruffians, and middle peasants were absorbed in large numbers, causing impurity within the Party and planting bad roots. At this time, the number of Party members had increased to 21, including two poor peasants, 17 middle peasants, and two bankrupt landlords.
    In famine years, the relief grain and regulating grain issued by the government, as well as the grain obtained from investigating black land and liquidating the agency heads' accounts, were given to whoever he wanted to give it to. The accounts for these grains were never made public. The poor and middle peasants couldn't even eat bran, and people died (more than 70 people died in 1942 and 1943) or fled, while his family (six people) never stopped eating noodles and meat, and also supported a prostitute. The masses said: "If Old Guo doesn't die, the opinions about him couldn't be carried by livestock. Calculating the accounts of the cooperative is better than calculating the accounts of the famine years."
    After the "May 4th" Directive, Guo Peiyuan had died, but the newly risen cadres still inherited his mantle in their work style, monopolizing power, oppressing the masses, and fighting on behalf of the masses. Four struggles were carried out successively in the anti-traitor liquidation and filling-in-the-gaps movements, killing five special agent landlords and struggling against 25 landlord and rich peasant families. Ten middle peasant families were struggled against in the name of politics, and poor peasant Niu Qiushan was struggled against in the name of bandits and beaten to death. This case has not yet been resolved. A total of 18.9 hectares of land and 309 rooms were seized. In addition, 19 middle peasant families, fearing trouble, contributed 87 rooms.
    The distribution of these fruits was as follows: the land was roughly average in quantity and yield. The cadres were mostly middle peasants, and they received a total of less than 0.67 hectares. However, a few cadres exchanged bad land for good land, and some military dependents and aggressive rogue activists received good land. There was originally little good land, so most of the land distributed to the poor and hired peasants was bad land. The distribution of houses was even more unfair. After several large cadres had selected the good houses, the remainder was distributed to military dependents. The houses distributed to the poor and hired peasants were not only bad but also few. Movable property was only distributed once at the end. In the past, it was all sold for money: 1. Low-price grading and sale. The poor and hired peasants were nominally first-class, with the priority to buy, but they had no money, and the good things were still bought by second and third class (cadres were mostly in the second class). 2. Price raising and sale: whoever paid the most money, it was sold to them. The masses had to pay in cash, but the cadres could owe money. 3. Not directly moving the landlord's movable property, but letting him sell it himself and pay the money. The sale of movable property, together with the seized silver dollars and banknotes, amounted to 6.2 million yuan, all of which went into the cooperative. Only 1.6 million yuan of share certificates were distributed, and no dividends were ever distributed.
    Cadre situation: The cadres in the village can be divided into three types: The first type is represented by Zhang Zengxian, the vice chairman of the peasant association, and Wang Tianshun, the director of the military committee. Their background is that of bankrupt landlords (not identified by the masses). Their common characteristics are the exploitative ideology of the landlord class and the bullying and ruffian style: not working, eating and drinking extravagantly, gambling, and having illicit relationships with women. They infiltrated the Party and became cadres, doing even more unscrupulous things, oppressing the masses, beating poor and hired peasants to death, provoking discord, and creating chaos in the whole village. The second type is represented by Niu Fushan, the political director. His background is that of a middle peasant. His ideological characteristics are reflected in his eagerness in work and his undemocratic style towards cadres and the masses, looking down on honest cadres and honest peasants. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was resolute in fighting the enemy, and in the anti-traitor movement and the filling-in-the-gaps movement, he was resolute in fighting the landlords and special agents. Generally speaking, he can still carry out the Party's tasks, has a sense of organization, and still retains the nature of a peasant in his lifestyle, working hard and being frugal. The masses' feedback on him is: "Good at bragging, likes to put on airs!" The third type is represented by Liu Zhengfu, the director of the peasant association, and Ren Chenggui, the village chief. Their backgrounds are one lower-middle peasant and one poor peasant. Their common characteristics are honesty, not being arrogant, not oppressing the masses, being willing to work, and not being dictatorial in their work. However, because they have always been "sidekicks" and lack awareness, they are easily exploited. Liu Zhengfu became close friends with the bankrupt landlord Liu Guangxian. Although he himself did not directly oppress the masses, Liu Guangxian relied on their power to be tyrannical. When Zhang Zengxian, the director of the peasant association, and Wang Tianshun, the director of the military committee, took the lead in opposing Niu Fushan, the political director, they were also exploited. Niu Fushan's work style was undemocratic, and Liu Zhengfu and Ren Chenggui were both dissatisfied with Niu. Zhang and Wang used this point to unite them and encouraged them to take the lead in attacking Niu Fushan together. They didn't work or go to district meetings, and swore oaths to each other, saying that whoever turned to Niu Fushan would suffer the consequences. It wasn't until the recent rectification campaign that their clique was broken up. The honest director of the peasant association and the village chief realized that they had been tricked.

　　史二庄地主分子乘机钻进党内
  　控制支部压迫农民
    【本报消息】武安九区史二庄支部已经有了近十年的历史。支部才建立时，曾领导群众对日寇、对地主进行斗争，但是作风却很不民主。以后破落地主、流氓钻进支部，造成严重的党内不纯。他们挑拨支部压制农民，有些本质上较好的党员也受了他们的坏影响。兹将史二庄概况及支部情形报导如下：
    史二庄是一个相当穷的村子，至今群众口里还流传着这样的话：“要吃面，上伯延；要吃糠，上史二庄”。全村二百九十六户，一千零七口人，三十五顷零二十四亩地，每人平均三亩半，产量平均三石。比较附近的村子，数量和产量都少。地是石厚土薄，四面都是沙石山，山坡地多，一下雨，地里就淤一层沙，群众们说：“史二庄的地都在墙上挂着”。这种地打粮食少，误工大。每年冬季为了积肥，山圪凹里的白草根都要刮光。
    抗战以前，该村往坡底下（坦岭以东）出过一百八十个长工，到周庄的最多，曾有小史二庄之称。就是现在，被隔离在关外、平津一带的店员和苦力，还有六十八人，村上老少光棍汉还有一百三十七人。
    抗战前后，全村没有上一顷地的地主，二十九家地主富农的地亩总数，还超不过十顷。但政治经济的统治权却完全操在他们手里。刘正仁、王国清是他们的总头子，群众们说：“他俩，一个顶着史二庄半个天”。
    三八年冬，该村就有党的秘密小组，党员四人。在准备成立农会时，地主们却先成立起假农会来了。别的村都是五等派款，该村还照样摊派，大部还派在穷人身上。地主们宣传几个贫农活动分子都是赖人，并且把他们的名字编成歌子在街上唱：“张万盛、郭培元，虫钻鼻子（贫农任兴亮的鼻子有毛病）老大年，金旺、虎门不沾弦”。一天夜里，成立农会，刘正仁、王国清带着一伙地主打进会场，并且在路上拦住登记名字。第一次的农会，就这样被他们打散了。
    三九年春，党员发展至十一人，又重新成立农会，接着斗争了刘正仁。因为他勾结大汉奸李品山，在牛王窊成立“自治军”。把他家里全部浮财都没收了。这个大头子打倒以后，地主们在政治上公开的权力就算基本上摧垮了。经济上经四一年查黑地，清算社头（社头都是地主轮流充当）帐目，及四二年减租减息运动，一部分是大量削弱了，有七家完全垮台了。贫雇有的算得一部分粮食和地，有的贱价买了地主一部分地或当得一部分地。
    该村的新政权虽然建立得较早，对敌和对地主斗争也很坚决，但作风极不民主，形成一人专主。党、政、武装的大权完全操在流氓出身的郭培元之手。群众说他：“两头瞧不起，瞧不起地主也瞧不起穷人”。不仅群众害怕他，就是干部党员也得完全听他一人指使。谁不和他一心，就踢开谁。老实农民党员被开除出党，破落地主、流氓、中农被大量吸收进来。造成党内不纯，种下了坏根。这时，党员已发展至二十一人，内有贫农二人，中农十七人，破落地主二人。
    灾荒年，政府发下的救济粮、调剂粮，以及查黑地、清算社头帐目得来的粮食，他愿意给谁吃就给谁吃。这些粮食出入，从未公布过帐目。贫、中农连糠都吃不上，死的死（四二、四三两年死七十多人），逃的逃，他家里（六口人）却断不了吃面、吃肉，并且还养活着一个破鞋。群众说：“老郭要是不死，对他的意见牲口驮也驮不完。算合作社的帐，不如算灾荒年的帐”。
    “五四”指示以后，郭培元已死，新起来的干部在作风上仍然继承了他的衣钵，独霸专权，欺压群众，代替群众斗争。反奸清算及填平补齐先后斗争了四次，打死特务地主五人，斗争了地主、富农二十五家。用政治名义斗争了十家中农，用土匪名义斗争了贫雇牛秋山，并且打死了他，这个案子现在还没有解决。总共斗出土地二百八十三亩，房子三百零九间。另外有十九家中农因为害怕，献出房子八十七间。
    这些果实的分配情形是这样：地在数量和产量上大致还平均，干部多是中农，他们分得的总共不到十亩。但少数干部拿坏地换成了好地，部分军属和得势的流氓积极分子都分得了好地，本来好地就少，所以分到贫雇名下的就绝大部分都是赖地了。房子的分配更不公道，好房子是经几个大干部挑了之后，剩余的分给军属。分给贫雇的不仅赖而且少。浮财只是最后分过一次，以往都是卖钱：一、贱价分等卖，贫雇名义上都是头等，有优先权进去买，但手头没钱，好东西还是给二、三等（干部多在二等）买去了。二、抬价钱卖：谁出的钱多，就卖给谁。群众非拿现钱不可，干部却可以欠帐。三、不直接动地主浮财，由他本人变卖交钱。卖浮财连同斗出的现洋、钞票共六百二十万元，都入在合作社，其中只有一百六十万分过股金票，红利一文也没有分过。
    干部情况：该村干部可以分为三种类型：第一类是以农会副主任张增贤、武委会主任王天顺为代表。他们的成份是破落地主（未经群众划），他们的共同特点是地主阶级的剥削思想和恶霸流氓作风：不劳动，大吃大喝，赌博，乱搞女人。钻进党内，当了干部，更加无所不为，欺压群众，打死贫雇，挑拨是非，把全村造成混乱现象。第二类是以政治主任牛福山为代表，他成份是中农。他的思想特点，表现在工作中是抢先，和对干部群众不民主的作风，瞧不起老实干部和老实农民。但他在抗日时期对敌斗争及在反奸运动与填补运动中对地主特务斗争是坚决的，一般的说，他还能执行党的任务，还有组织观念，生活作风上还保有农民本色，劳动好，节俭。群众对他的反映是：“好称能，好耍态度！”第三类是以农会主任刘正富、村长任成贵为代表，他们的成份一个是下中农，一个是贫农。他们的共同特点是老实，不自高自大，不欺压群众，肯劳动，工作方面都不专主。但由于他们一向是作“陪客”，觉悟不够，因此就易被人利用。刘正富和破落地主刘广先成了亲密的朋友，他自己虽不直接压迫群众，但刘广先却仗着他们的势力横行霸道。当农会主任张增贤、武委会主任王天顺领头，反对政治主任牛福山的时候，他们俩也被利用了。牛福山作风不民主，刘正富、任成贵都对牛不满，张、王就利用这一点，团结了他们，并鼓励他们带头，一同进攻牛福山。不做工作，也不上区开会，互相起誓，谁向了牛福山，谁就会怎样怎样。一直到最近整党，才把他们的一窝蜂打散。老实的农会主任、村长才感到是上了人家的当。
