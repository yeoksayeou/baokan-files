Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions on protecting urban industry and commerce in the land redistribution movement. It pointed out that some counties have seen phenomena that violate the policy of urban industry and commerce. For example, if a landlord also engages in industry and commerce, his industrial and commercial assets are confiscated. In some cases, those who had completely or partially converted to industry and commerce after August 15th [1945] before the land reform were also completely confiscated, and even those who had been deprived of their land by the Japanese invaders and turned to industry and commerce are now being treated as landlords. The reasons for these phenomena are the misconception that the Northeast, after fourteen years of rule by the enemy and puppets, implemented a monopoly, and there are no longer any national industries and private capital; that state-owned and cooperative enterprises are not needed private capital in the future; and that they have neglected to publicize and explain the policy of protecting industry and commerce to poor peasants and hired farm laborers, narrowly hoping that the peasants will gain more ill-gotten wealth. If these errors are not corrected immediately, it will be very detrimental to the development of production, the prosperity of the economy, and the satisfaction of the peasants' own needs. The instructions specifically stipulate that landlords who are also engaged in industry and commerce should only have their land and other feudal exploitation parts in the countryside confiscated and usury abolished. Everything else should remain untouched. Pure industrialists and businessmen before the land reform in July 1946 should be protected, regardless of whether they were landlords in the past. Except for the industrial and commercial enterprises of big traitors, big bullies, big secret agents, and big landlords who occupy a dominant position in the entire county or city and are extremely sinful, the disguised landlords who engage in small businesses after the land reform to escape struggle, and the disguised industrial and commercial enterprises of counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, which should be resolutely confiscated, other industrial and commercial entrepreneurs who have made some mistakes and shortcomings in the past but now obey government laws and decrees can be asked to confess their political mistakes and repent. Their industrial and commercial property and assets should not be confiscated or arbitrarily fined under any pretext. From now on, peasants are not allowed to directly seize factories and stores, directly confiscate the property of industrialists and businessmen, or arrest and fine people. As for the above-mentioned regulations that big traitors, bullies, landlords, Chiang Kai-shek's special agent disguised landlords and their industrial and commercial enterprises can be arrested and confiscated, it must also be reviewed and approved by the county and municipal government, and executed by the county and municipal public security bureaus, and then handed over to the relevant peasants or relevant agencies. After the confiscation, except for large industrial and commercial enterprises that are handed over to the government for processing so that they can continue to operate, others should not be dispersed and abandoned. Whether cooperative management or resale, it should be continued. The instructions also stipulate that private seizure, confiscation, arrest, and fines without the county, municipal government, and public security bureau are illegal acts. If peasants request to enter the city to settle accounts with industrial and commercial enterprises, the local responsible cadres should review and study them with a responsible attitude according to the party's policies, and explain them to the peasants to prevent dissatisfaction. At the same time, all localities should discuss the policy of protecting industry and commerce in detail at the congresses of poor peasants, hired farm laborers and representatives.

    地主兼工商业者
    不动工商业部分
    合江省委发出指示
    【新华社东北十七日电】中共合江省委日前特颁发平分土地运动中，保护城市工商业的指示。指出：有些县已发生了违反城市工商业政策的现象。如地主兼营工商业的，他的工商业被没收。有的是“八一五”后土改前已全部或部分转为工商业的，也被全部没收，甚至过去被日寇夺去了土地而转为工商业的，现在还当作地主处理。发生这些现象的原因是误认为东北经敌伪十四年统治，实行过专卖，已没有民族工商业和私人资本；今后有国营和合作社不需要私人资本；以及忽视向贫雇农宣传解释保护工商业政策，狭隘的希望农民多得点浮财。这些错误如不立即纠正，对发展生产，繁荣经济，和满足农民本身需要都很不利。指示特规定：地主兼工商业的只没收乡村中土地及其它封建剥削部分、废除高利贷。其他一律不动。一九四六年七月土改前的纯工商业者，不管过去是否地主一律保护。除在全县、全市占统治地位，罪大恶极的大汉奸、大恶霸、大特务、大地主的工商业，土改后为逃避斗争搞点小买卖的化形地主，和反革命蒋特的伪装工商业，坚决没收外，其他过去有点错误和缺点，而现在服从政府法令的工商业者，可要他政治上坦白改过，不能借故没收其工商业及财产，或任意罚款。今后农民不得直接查封工厂、商店，直接没收工商业者的财产或捕人罚款。至于上述规定可逮捕没收大奸霸地主、蒋特化形地主和其工商业，也须经县、市政府审查批准，由县、市公安局执行，然后交给有关农民或有关机关。没收后除大工商业交政府处理使其能继续营业外，其他也不应分散荒废。无论合作经营或转卖，应使之继续开办。指示并规定：不经县、市政府和公安局，私自查封、没收、捕人、罚款都是非法行为。农民要求入城清算工商业，当地负责干部，应以负责态度，根据党的政策审查研究，并向农民解释。不使其发生不满。同时各地应在贫雇农大会和代表会上，将保护工商业政策详细讨论清楚。
