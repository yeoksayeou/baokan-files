    Neiqiu Organizes Large-Scale Publicity for Market Fairs

    Since the publication of the Outline Land Law in the newspaper, in addition to transferring county and district cadres to go deep into the countryside to cooperate with village cadres in publicizing the Land Law, cadres in government offices have also organized publicity in the local area. Cadres and teachers from institutions such as the county government, the county committee, the public security bureau, the county cooperative, and the Second Higher Primary School organized publicity activities on the 25th and 28th days of the twelfth lunar month (market days), which achieved great results. A total of seven groups were organized, with one person in each group responsible for explaining, and the other comrades dispersed among the crowd to listen to feedback. The focus of the publicity was: (1) to make the masses understand that the Outline Land Law is the best policy to completely eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation, meet the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and thoroughly become masters of their own affairs; (2) to explain that it is necessary to resolutely unite with the middle peasants during the equal distribution and dispel the middle peasants' ideological doubts; (3) to prevent and expose the sabotage of landlords and rich peasants and overcome waste, and to maintain normal production; and to cite examples of criminal facts of sabotaging the Land Law in the county to advise listeners not to repeat the same mistakes. More than 10,000 people attended the market on both of these days. As soon as they heard that the Land Law Outline was being promoted, they listened quietly to the explanations, and some even sat down automatically. On North Street, a man in his thirties approached the propagandist and said, "We must go and listen to the Land Law explanation." Another old man went to listen with wide eyes and a grin. In the South Gate pig market, people were very scattered. When the propagandist first started speaking, only a few dozen people were listening, but as soon as they heard that it was about the Outline Land Law, more and more people gathered, and after the speech, they asked for it to be repeated. When the propagandist asked for listeners' opinions, an old man said: "No one in the village can explain what the Land Law is saying. Everyone thought it was 'communization' and that middle peasants would be struggled against! After this explanation, I understand, and there is nothing to be afraid of." Two people in their forties and fifties from Luting Village said together: "Cadres should not take or touch the fruits they get." Some people said, "This is great. After the equal distribution, everyone will have land, and we will have food and clothing to produce properly." After listening to the speech, an old man from Fugou went to the county bank to talk about the equal distribution of land. He said, "No one talks about it in the village, and no one understands. Everyone thought that the middle peasants would inevitably be struggled against in this distribution. I wanted to ask the village cadres, but I was afraid of being accused of sabotage. I understood it at the market today; it's not about struggling against the middle peasants." After the comrades in the bank inquired, they learned that he was a middle peasant. An old woman attending the market laughed when she heard Comrade Cheng Shengkui of the County Committee talk about how some middle peasants thought that the equal distribution was a random division, and that they did not even dare to transport manure to the fields. This was a misunderstanding of the Land Law. After Comrade Cheng finished speaking, the masses applauded and supported him. (Neiqiu Education Section)

    内邱组织集市大宣传
    自从报上公布土地法大纲后，除抽调县区干部深入农村配合村干宣传土地法外，在机关的干部，又组织了驻地宣传。计有县政府县委会、群武公安局、县联社、二高等机关干部和教员，于阴历十二月二十五、二十八日两个集期上，进行宣传，收到很大的成绩。共组织了七个小组，每组有一个人专作讲解，其他的同志分散到人群里去听取反映。宣传重点是：（一）使群众了解土地法大纲是彻底消灭封建半封建剥削，满足贫雇要求，彻底翻身当家的最好的政策。（二）说明平分中要坚决团结中农，解除中农的思想怀疑。（三）防止与揭发地富分子的破坏及克服浪费，照常的生产；并例举本县破坏土地法的犯罪事实劝告听众不要故犯。这两个集上每日均有赶集万余群众。一听说宣传土地法大纲，都静听着讲解，有的便自动的坐下来。在北大街有一个三十多岁的人，一面向宣传员靠近，一面说：讲土地法可得去听听；另一个老头瞪着眼裂着嘴笑嘻嘻的去听哩。南关猪市人很分散，宣传员初讲时不过几十个人听，但一听说是讲土地法大纲，就越聚越多，讲完后都还要求再讲。当宣传员征求听众意见时，一个老头说：在村里谁也解不开土地法是说啥哩，都以为是“共产”的，要斗中农哇！这样一讲我可明白了，这还有啥怕的。鲁亭村有两个四五十岁的人在一块说：干部多得的果实不退也不沾了。有的人说这可好啦，平分一下都有了地，有吃、有穿可好好生产吧。富沟一个老年，在听毕讲话后，到县银行去还提到平分土地的事，他说：“在村没人讲，谁也不明白，都以为这次平分，中农免不了挨斗争，想问问村干部，又怕说是破坏，今天集上可听明白了，并不是斗中农。”经行里同志问过，才知道他是个中农。一个赶集的老婆，听到县委会程升魁同志谈到有些中农认为平分是打乱均分，连粪也不敢往地里运的想法，这是对土地法的误解时，她便嗤的笑了。程同志讲完后群众都鼓掌拥护。（内邱教育科）
