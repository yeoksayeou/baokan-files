Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to Shanghai news: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Shanghai staged yet another violent suppression of thousands of dance hostesses and dance hall workers (Agence France-Presse reported: 4,000 dance hostesses and 2,000 workers) on the 30th of last month. Because the Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai authorities ordered the city's dance halls to close, without providing dance hostesses and workers with a proper means of livelihood, the dance hostesses and workers held a meeting in a dance hall that day, then marched to the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Social Bureau to petition. The Social Bureau ignored them, and Chiang Kai-shek's Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu and Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Police Chief Yu Shuping personally led a large number of soldiers and police to suppress them, brutally beating the dance hostesses. Dozens were injured on the spot, and more than 700 were arrested. The dance hostesses were filled with righteous indignation and smashed the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Social Bureau. Afterwards, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits forcibly disbanded the Shanghai Dance Hall Trade Association and the Dance Hall Workers' Union. More than one hundred of those arrested are still being detained.

    上海舞女职工反压迫
    捣毁蒋匪社会局
    【新华社陕北四日电】据上海消息：上海蒋匪当局上月三十日又演出武力镇压舞女及舞厅职工数千人（法新社称：舞女四千、职工二千）请愿的暴举。因蒋匪上海当局勒令该市舞厅停业，而又不给舞女及职工解决正当生活出路，舞女职工等遂于是日在某舞厅开会后，奔赴蒋匪社会局请愿，社会局不予置理，并由蒋匪淞沪警备司令宣铁吾和蒋匪沪警察局长俞叔平亲率大批军警前来弹压，对舞女实行残酷殴击，当场被殴受伤者数十人，另有七百余人被捕。舞女等群情激愤，曾将蒋匪社会局捣毁。蒋匪事后又将上海舞厅同业公会和舞厅工人工会强力解散。被捕者中至今尚有百余人仍被拘禁。
