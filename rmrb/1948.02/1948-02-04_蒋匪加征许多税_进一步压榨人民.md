Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: According to reports from various sources, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, in order to salvage its internal war financial crisis and further exploit the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, is currently increasing various taxes. The Chiang Kai-shek State Council has approved an increase of 50 percent in import tariffs from the beginning of this year, and the salt tax has been increased from 100,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan (Chiang currency) per dan. The Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Finance has also revised the collection methods for business income tax, stipulating that the Chiang Kai-shek local tax authorities can arbitrarily determine the tax amount, forcibly order various industries and businesses to pay in advance, and set a deadline of one month from the date of notification to pay in full. Those who fail to pay within the deadline will be fined 20 to 300 percent of the tax amount or ordered to suspend business, with compulsory recovery. In addition, local cigarette taxes have also been increased by 100 to 300 percent. Cigarette manufacturers in Chongqing are facing a crisis of bankruptcy because the tax increase of three times at once is difficult to bear.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, in the face of the increasingly serious Chiang Kai-shek military crisis, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities recently revised Article 19 of its so-called general mobilization "implementation measures," stipulating that the Chiang Kai-shek local "competent authorities" can arbitrarily requisition civilian vehicles, ships, aviation equipment, and repair factories, docks, engine rooms, etc., to serve its internal war. Commercial vehicles in Tianjin and Beijing have been forced to register before the new year and can be requisitioned at any time.

    蒋匪加征许多税  进一步压榨人民
    【新华社陕北二日电】据各方报导：蒋匪政府为了挽救其内战财政危机，进一步压榨蒋区人民，近正加征各种税收。蒋匪国务会议已通过自今年元旦起，增加进口关税百分之五十，盐税由每担十万元增至廿五万元（蒋币）。营利事业所得税征稽办法也经蒋匪财政部重新修正，规定由蒋匪各地税收机关随意酌定税额，强令各工商业提前缴纳，并限期于接到通知后一个月内一次缴足，逾期不缴者处以相当于税额百分之二十至三百之罚款或勒令停业、强制追缴。此外各地卷烟税也已增加百分之一百至三百不等，重庆各卷烟厂商已因一次加税三倍难以负担，而面临破产危机。
    【新华社陕北二日电】据蒋区报纸消息：在蒋匪军事危机日益严重的局面下，蒋匪当局近特将其所谓总动员“实施办法”第十九条加以修正，规定蒋匪各地“主管机关”可任意强征民间车辆、船舶、航空器材，及修理工厂、码头、机房等，为其内战服务。平津两市商营汽车已于年前被迫登记，随时征用。
