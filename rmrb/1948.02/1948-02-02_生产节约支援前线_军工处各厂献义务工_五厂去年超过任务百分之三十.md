Production and Savings to Support the Front Lines
    Military Factories Dedicate Voluntary Labor
    Factory Five Exceeded Last Year's Target by 30 Percent
[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Military Industry Department's Workers' Weekly: Workers in factories under the Military Industry Department are working hard to produce and support the front lines, dedicating a lot of voluntary labor. After mobilization at the general meeting of all employees in Factory Six, everyone was in high spirits. One hundred percent of the comrades automatically proposed adding three, four, or six days of voluntary labor. Some even wanted to add ten days of voluntary labor last month. In total, the factory dedicated 945 days of voluntary labor. In addition, they made donations totaling 776,500 yuan. According to Factory Six's wage situation, this is equivalent to 776 days of work, which, combined with the voluntary labor, totals 1,721 days of work. This exceeds the predetermined number by 57.1 percent.
    After the meeting, the workers immediately took action, working twelve hours a day and eating meals in the workshop, demonstrating a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. Comrades in Factory Five were also very active in donating labor. All employees participated, contributing a total of 1,745 and a half days of voluntary labor and donating 845,500 yuan. Because Factory Five's relocation affected several days of work, the workers immediately carried out installation work at the new location, followed by a large-scale production surge. Thanks to the special efforts of all workers, in December, they not only made up for the losses caused by the relocation but also exceeded the production plan by 30 percent.
    [Another Item] Last year, under the call to create a "Liu Bocheng Factory" and support the front lines, all employees of the Military Industry Department's Factory Five maintained an unprecedented level of production enthusiasm from beginning to end, not only successfully completing the annual task but also exceeding the target by an average of 29.6 percent. In the spring and summer seasons, they generally exceeded the target by more than 20 percent. In the autumn, in order to reduce costs and prepare for relocation, all employees, with a high degree of political awareness, voluntarily switched from piecework to hourly work. The production enthusiasm not only did not decrease but instead exceeded that of the piecework period. Output increased month by month, eventually exceeding the target by 29 percent. In the last quarter, in order to ensure that relocation did not disrupt production, all employees worked tirelessly, regardless of fatigue and fear of difficulties, simultaneously constructing and producing, maximizing labor intensity. As a result, the relocation task was completed in half a month, and work was quickly resumed. During the winter summary, the target was exceeded by 40 percent.
