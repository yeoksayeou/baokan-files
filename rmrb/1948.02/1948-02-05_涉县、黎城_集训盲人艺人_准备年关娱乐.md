	Shexian and Licheng are actively preparing to deeply promote the Outline Land Law during the New Year entertainment. To train propagandists for the New Year entertainment, Shexian recently convened a meeting of blind people and those who can recite ballads. They studied and discussed the Land Law and the new situation this year, and created propaganda materials such as ballads. They were divided into four groups: one group discussed the general spirit of the Outline Land Law, one group discussed the origins of the Land Law and various specific issues, one group discussed major world events, and one group specifically discussed the new situation. Everyone is now writing and singing their own material, with cadres helping to write it down. After it is completed, they plan to perform it in the city first, and after being reviewed by the masses and collecting opinions for revision, they will go back to their respective areas to promote it. The urban school district of Licheng also held a teachers' meeting on the 28th of last month to discuss how to deeply promote the Land Law and the victorious situation of the Taihang counter-offensive this year during the Lunar New Year. It was unanimously decided that new dramas should be performed by existing troupes in various villages, and various forms such as Yangko and Xiaohua Opera should be used to expand publicity. It was also decided to organize a large number of artists from the masses to create works, collect folk songs spontaneously circulating among the masses, and cultivate new Li Youcais. The meeting specifically decided that the main focus of preparation should be on children, and the masses can participate voluntarily at that time. Simple economy should be promoted, and extravagance and waste should be opposed. After the meeting, the main village in the city immediately convened a meeting of actors and artists from the rural theater troupes to discuss the matter. An entertainment and propaganda committee was established on the spot, and it was divided into two groups for preparation: one group was responsible for writing and creation, with the participation of teachers, actors, and artists; the other group was responsible for free teaching and preparing to organize the masses. The children in Beifang and Dongguan have now learned many newly composed Land Law songs.

	[Taihang News] In the process of preparing for the New Year entertainment, Yuanshi and Xiyang discovered that some village cadres, ignoring the urgent production needs of the masses, forced the organization of drama performances and indulged in extravagance and waste, increasing the burden on the masses. The wasteland reclamation in Nan'zuo and Northeast Village of Yuanshi is serious, and the masses are urgently demanding production to overcome the famine. In particular, poor and hired peasants have many production difficulties, but the village cadres simply ignore this, and only organize young women to perform dramas and make entertainment every day, even performing until midnight and not being able to go back, which has caused family dissatisfaction. At the same time, they also forced women who do not perform in dramas to spin three liang of cotton for each woman who performs in dramas without any compensation, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of women, especially poor and hired women, affecting their willingness to spin cotton. The militia instructor of Beizhangcheng in Xiyang also led a group of young men and women to run a theater troupe every night, and also "mobilized" (that is, forced) twenty catties of oil from the masses. The masses are very dissatisfied with this behavior and demand that it be corrected immediately.

    集训盲人艺人  准备年关娱乐
    【太行消息】涉县、黎城正积极准备在年关娱乐中，深入宣传土地法大纲。涉县为了集训年关娱乐中的宣传员，最近召集一批盲人和会说鼓词的人开会，一面讨论学习，了解土地法和今年的新形势，一面创作鼓词等宣传材料。一共分了四个组，一组是讨论宣传土地法大纲的总精神，一组是讨论宣传土地法来源和各种具体问题，一组是讨论宣传天下大事，一组是专门讨论宣传新形势。现在大家正在自编自唱，由干部执笔帮助。编好后，还准备先在城里演唱一下，经群众审查，搜集意见修改后，再分头回去搞。黎城城里学区也在上月二十八日召开教员会，讨论旧历年关如何深入宣传土地法和今年太反攻的胜利形势。一致决定：要利用各村旧有的剧团演新剧，利用秧歌、小花戏等多种多样的形式来扩大宣传，并要大批组织群众中的艺人进行创作，搜集群众中自发流行的歌谣，培养新的李有才。会上特别决定：平时准备主要是儿童，到时群众可自愿参加。要提倡简单节约，反对铺张浪费。会后，城里主村马上召集在乡剧团演员和艺人开会讨论，当场并成立起娱乐宣传委员会，共分两伙伙准备：一伙是编写创作，由教员、演员、艺人参加；一伙是义教负责，准备组织群众搞。北纺、东关的儿童现在已经学会好多新编的土地法歌子。
    【太行消息】元氏、昔阳在准备年关娱乐当中，发现有些村干部不顾群众迫切的生产要求，强迫组织演剧，并铺张浪费，加重群众负担。元氏南佐、东北村灭荒严重，群众迫切要求生产渡荒，特别是贫雇农生产困难很多，但该村干部根本不管，只是天天组织青年妇女演剧闹娱乐，甚至演到半夜还不能回去，更引起家庭不满。同时，还强迫不演剧的妇女，毫无代价的给每个演剧妇女代纺三两花，引起广大妇女特别是贫雇妇女的不满，影响她们不愿意纺花。昔阳北掌城民兵指导员，也领着一伙青年男女，每天晚上搞剧团，还向群众“动员”（就是强迫）了二十斤油。群众对这种行为很不满意，要求马上加以纠正。
