    【News from our paper】Zhang Wanqing and Liang Madou, two cadres from the Fifth District of Lucheng, went to Licun Gou to publicize the Land Law Outline. Instead of using the method of cadres gathering people, they directly visited poor farmers. On the evening of the 23rd, they had a discussion with more than ten poor and hired peasants, including Chen Liansheng and Shen Lisheng. Zhang Wanqing read the Land Law two or three times and gave a detailed explanation. The poor and hired peasants were very excited to know that they could rise up to be masters of their own affairs and completely turn themselves around. They poured out their heartfelt words, one after another. The various situations of the incomplete land reform in Licun Gou were largely clarified.
    Village Cadres Shelter Landlords, Many Were Not Struggled Against
    There were nine big landlord families in the whole village, but only four were struggled against. The remaining five were not struggled against because they were all relatives of the village cadres. Village Chief Yang Fazhe and Armed Committee Director Han Yuzhong openly said to the masses: "These five families became rich through labor, it is right to ask them to voluntarily take out some things." As a result, they were all sheltered. Landlord Yang Guicheng (the village chief's relative) only calculated forty dan of coarse grain, but he was unwilling to give it. He ran to the Taiyue District and lived there for more than ten days. He took a hand grenade back and pretended to have joined the Eighth Route Army, threatening the masses everywhere. The village chief said: "He has already joined the Eighth Route Army, exempt him from ten dan!" In the end, he only gave thirty dan of coarse grain, and that was the end of it.
    Landlord Yang Gejiao cultivated fifty mu of land, had forty-five rooms, fed two head of livestock, and also ran a grocery store and a vinegar workshop, eating meat and noodles every day, and often lending grain and money. During the struggle, he "voluntarily" gave thirty dan of coarse grain, and everything else was untouched. He even got into the Farmers' Association and became a village cadre and militiaman, continuing to oppress the masses. Yang Fushun's family of five cultivated one hundred and ten mu of land, had twenty-nine rooms in a two-story building, raised a flock of sheep, fed three head of livestock, and hired four long-term laborers, lending grain and money. Now he still has two head of livestock, one cart, forty mu of land, and eight rooms, and the sheep have not been touched at all. He is still living a good life. Li Shunzhi's family of seven cultivated one hundred and fifty mu of land, fed two head of livestock, had thirty-four rooms in a two-story building, and hired two people. He "voluntarily" gave eighty dan of coarse grain, seventy-two mu of bad land, twenty-five yuan in silver, and two pieces of clothing, and that was the end of it. Now he still has thirty-four rooms in a two-story building, one head of livestock, one cart, and seventy-eight mu of good land. All the interior goods were untouched, and life is still very good. Shen Xinyou cultivated one hundred and twenty mu of land, fed three head of livestock, and had thirty-one rooms in a two-story building. He "voluntarily" gave one head of livestock, ten mu of bad land, and ten dan of coarse grain. Now he still has one hundred mu of good land, two head of livestock, three carts, and thirty-one rooms. The interior goods were untouched, and he even hired a long-term laborer and shared the fruits of labor. Yang Guicheng cultivated one hundred and twenty mu of land, had twenty-six rooms in a two-story building, fed two head of livestock, and lent grain and money. He "voluntarily" gave one head of livestock, one cart, and thirty dan of coarse grain, and everything else was untouched.

    The above five families had a total of one hundred and thirty-seven rooms in two-story buildings, three hundred and fifty-eight mu of good land, eight head of livestock, nine carts, and a flock of sheep. Under the protection of the village cadres, some were classified as middle peasants, and some got into the Farmers' Association and became village cadres and militiamen, continuing to ride on the heads of the masses, acting like overlords.

    Village Cadres, After Hearing the Land Law, Still Want to Cover Up

    After landlord Yang Guicheng got into the militia, he colluded with the director of the Armed Committee and the public security officer, and sneaked into the homes of poor peasants Jia Fubao and Shen Lisheng in the middle of the night, dragged them outside the village, pretended to be Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and scared them. They also beat Shen Lisheng. The destitute Shen Xicun's family of two was allocated three rooms, eight mu of land, one hundred jin of corn, and two pieces of clothing during the land reform. But they had no latrine, so they couldn't put manure on the land, and they had no livestock or cart, so they were worried all day long. Poor peasant Tiansheng was allocated four shi of rice in the struggle. He couldn't bear to eat it every day, and wanted to save it up to buy livestock. Landlord Han Huaicheng deceived him into buying it together, and bought a horse. Han Huaicheng had carts and furniture, and never lent them to Tiansheng. Tiansheng bought livestock but couldn't use it, and was so angry that he went deaf in one ear. The son of destitute Shen Manxi joined the army, and he still lived in the temple. Later, he was allocated three rooms. In addition, there were five families with too few carts and no livestock, so they could not produce. There were also eight families who did not have enough food to eat. Poor peasant Yang Guosheng could only eat until the first month of the year.

    After the Land Law Outline was announced, the village chief and the director of the Armed Committee went to the district for a meeting. They didn't say a word when they came back, but first found the landlords Li Shunzhi, Shen Xiaofa, Han Gejiao, and Yang Fuming, and said to them: "The poor masses in our village have not turned themselves around. You quickly take out houses, land, and livestock to give to the masses, so that we will have something to say when the superiors come to investigate!" They also told them not to be pessimistic. The poor peasants all said: "Only when we are masters of our own affairs can we do a good job of implementing the Land Law!"

    区干部深入宣传土地法
    李村沟农民说知心话
    【本报消息】潞城五区区干部张万庆与梁马斗两同志到李村沟宣传土地法大纲，不用由干部召集人的办法，直接深入访问贫苦农民。又在二十三号晚上，和陈连生、申礼盛等十多个贫雇一起座谈，张万庆把土地法念了两三遍，并且作了详细解释。贫雇知道自己能起来当家，彻底翻身，都非常兴奋。把心坎里的话，你一句，我两嘴的都扯出来。李村沟土地改革不彻底的各种情形，大体上都弄清楚了。
    村干包庇地主，好多就没有斗。
    全村大地主有九户，只斗了四户，其余五户没有斗，因为都是村干部的本家和亲戚。村长杨发则和武委会主任韩玉忠公开对群众说：“这五户是劳动发家，叫他们自动拿出些东西就对了。”结果都包庇下来了。地主杨贵成（村长本家）只算了四十石粗粮，他还不肯出。跑到太岳区住了十多天，拿了一颗手榴弹回来，冒充参加了八路军，到处威胁群众。村长说：“他已经参加了八路军，免了他十石吧！”最后只出了三十石粗粮就算完事。
    地主杨圪角种五十亩地，房四十五间，喂两头牲口，还开着杂货铺、醋坊，每天吃肉吃面，经常放谷放帐。斗争时“自动”了三十石粗粮，其他一切未动。还钻进农会当了村干部、民兵，照旧欺压群众。杨福顺五口人，种一百一十亩地，房楼二十九间，养一群羊，喂三个牲口，雇四个长工，放谷放帐。现在还有牲口两个，大车一辆，地四十亩，房八间，羊根本没动，过的还是好生活。李顺只七口人，种一百五十亩地，喂两个牲口，楼房三十四间，雇两个人，“自动”出八十石粗粮，七十二亩坏地，现洋二十五元，衣服两件，牲口一个，就没了事。现在还有楼房三十四间，牲口一个，大车一辆，好地七十八亩，内货全部未动，生活仍然很好。申辛有种一百二十亩地，喂三个牲口，楼房三十一间，“自动”出牲口一个，坏地十亩，粗粮十石；现在还有好地一百亩，牲口两个，大车三辆，房三十一间。内货没动，还雇着一个长工，而且还分了果实。杨贵成种一百二十亩地，楼房二十六间，牲口两个，放谷放帐，“自动”出牲口一个，大车一辆，粗粮三十石，其他一概没动。
    以上五户，共有楼房一百三十七间，好地三百五十八亩，牲口八个，大车九辆，羊一群。在村干部包庇下，有的划成份划成中农，有的钻进了农会，当了村干部、民兵，继续骑在群众头上，作威作福。
    村干听了土地法，还想打掩护。
    地主杨贵成钻进民兵后，勾结武委会主任及公安员等，半夜三更黑洞洞的跳到贫雇贾付保和申礼盛家里，把他们拉到村外，冒充日本人和蒋匪，吓唬他们。并把申礼盛打了一顿。赤贫申喜存两口人，翻身中分了三间房，八亩地，一百斤玉茭，两件衣服。但是没有茅房，粪不能上地，更没有牲口、大车，仍然整天发愁。贫雇天盛在斗争中分了四石米，每天舍不得吃，想积起来买个牲口，地主韩怀成诳骗他合伙买，买了匹马。韩怀成有大车、有家具，从不借给天盛，天盛买了牲口用不上，干瞪眼，把耳朵都气聋了。赤贫申满喜的儿子参军了，自己还住在庙里，后来才分给他三间房。另外有五户少车没牲口，没法生产。还有八户粮食不够吃，贫雇杨过盛只能吃到正月。
    土地法大纲公布后，村长、武委会主任到区上开会，回来没有吭气，却先找了李顺只、申小发、韩圪角、杨福明这几户地主，对他们说：“咱村穷苦群众没有翻了身，你们赶快拿出房屋、土地、牲口给群众，上级来查，我们就有说的啦！”并叫他们不要悲观。贫雇都说：“一定要咱们自己来当家作主，才能把土地法办好！”
