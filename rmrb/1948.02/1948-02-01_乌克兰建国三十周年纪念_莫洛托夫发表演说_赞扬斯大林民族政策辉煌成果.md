Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Kyiv dispatch: This month on the 24th, for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, grand meetings were held throughout Ukraine to celebrate warmly. Molotov personally went to Kyiv to participate in the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's commemorative ceremony and, on behalf of the Soviet government, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and Stalin, extended congratulations to the Ukrainian people. Kyiv also held a grand military parade and a mass parade with 300,000 participants.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Kyiv dispatch: Molotov delivered a lengthy speech at the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of Ukraine, praising the great achievements of the Ukrainian people over the past thirty years. Molotov first pointed out: "The anniversary of the founding of Ukraine is a day of great significance to the Ukrainian people and all the people of the Soviet Union, and it has great international significance. The October Socialist Revolution liberated the people of old Russia from the shackles of capitalism and opened up the road to communism and a free and happy life for the people of the world. The Ukrainian people were the first to embark on this path after the Russian people. After embarking on the Soviet path, the Ukrainian people finally realized their long-cherished dream of establishing a nationally independent Ukrainian state, thus leading Ukraine into a new and truly glorious century." After tracing the arduous struggle of the Ukrainian people over the past thirty years against armed intervention and the German aggressors, Molotov praised Ukraine's rapid recovery and leaps and bounds progress after the war, saying: "The whole world knows that Ukraine is the birthplace of the famous Stakhanovite movement. At present, the movement to strive to complete the five-year plan in four years is flourishing. Ukrainian science and art are victoriously overcoming anti-people bourgeois influences and are gaining more universal respect among the Soviet and world people. The great hardships and trials of the Patriotic War are a clear testament to the strong will, political unity, and unwavering loyalty of the Ukrainian people to the Soviet government and the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. Now we know that the Ukrainian people and their vanguard, the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party, have gloriously passed all the tests." Molotov then pointed out: All Ukrainian territories, including Western Ukraine, Transcarpathian Ukraine, and Northern Bukovina, formerly belonging to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, are now united. "The current population of Ukraine is virtually equal to that of the largest countries in Europe." Molotov emphasized: The Ukrainian border has undergone major changes, having been surrounded by reactionary semi-fascist regimes in the past, but now it is adjacent to people's democratic regimes. "All this proves that the Leninist-Stalinist principles of nationalities policy have produced brilliant results. The Soviet regime has enabled the Ukrainian people to realize in the shortest period of time the dreams that could not be realized before capitalism was overthrown and the international prestige of socialism was not yet remarkable." Molotov concluded: "The Ukrainian people and the various nationalities of the Soviet Union are united in a plan to strive for the development and strengthening of their motherland, and this plan is a guarantee for the victorious advancement of the Soviet people. We believe that our domestic strength can serve as a reliable bulwark for the independence of our motherland. Our peace-loving people will fight to achieve lasting and enduring peace and national security. This is the basic task of Soviet Stalinist foreign policy. I believe that all the Ukrainian people will fully and resolutely support the Soviet government's and the Bolsheviks' domestic and foreign policies." Molotov's speech ended in a chorus of slogans, repeatedly eliciting thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers.
