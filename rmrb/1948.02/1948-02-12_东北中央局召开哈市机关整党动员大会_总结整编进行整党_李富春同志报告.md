Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: The Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party convened a Harbin Municipal Organs' Party Rectification Mobilization Meeting on the 26th of last month. Over a thousand cadres attended and listened to Comrade Li Fuchun's report on "Summarizing Reorganization and Conducting Party Rectification." Comrade Fuchun first pointed out that the three-month reorganization of Harbin municipal organs had come to an end. The directly subordinate organs of the Northeast Bureau and Military Region, as well as the provincial-level organs of Songjiang Province, reduced personnel by 12% of the original staff. This saved a great deal on housing, vehicles, etc., and could save approximately 130 million yuan in expenses for the whole year. Apart from a few dismissals or purges, the streamlined personnel were sent to work in the front lines, local factories, farms, and schools. The organs have become more organized, established their structures, and established office, living, and study systems. In particular, through democratic meetings, criticism and self-criticism were promoted, corruption and waste were opposed, work and the style of rear organs were improved, and everyone was alerted to how to work and live in the city. The gains in this regard are immeasurable and greater than the savings of manpower and material resources. Comrade Fuchun continued, saying that the reorganization still lacked a systematic solution to problems in ideological style, and democratic criticism and self-criticism had not been sufficiently developed. Therefore, the reorganization can only be regarded as the beginning of Party rectification. In the past ten years, our Party has grown from tens of thousands of members to 2.7 million members. Due to the Party's great development, some landlords, rich peasants, and rogue elements have infiltrated the Party, especially in grassroots organizations, where their impure composition has become an obstacle to land reform and revolutionary advancement. From the perspective of ideological impurity, it is not just a problem of grassroots organizations. Many cadres have shown unstable positions and blurred class views in implementing new tasks and new policies under the new situation, and have developed impure styles, especially prominent bureaucracy and formalism. Party rectification is to overcome these shortcomings. However, in the Northeast, because local Party organizations, especially grassroots organizations, are newly established, and some are still being established, impure composition and style cannot play a decisive role in whether land reform is thoroughly implemented. Moreover, when the land is thoroughly and equally distributed and the poor and hired peasant class rises, these organizations can be transformed in the movement. The decisive influence is the old cadres, because they are models for the new cadres and the backbone of the Party's close connection with the people of the Northeast. Therefore, the Northeast Bureau has decided to first pay attention to rectifying the old cadres. At this point, Comrade Fuchun cited the facts that some old cadres had shown left-right wavering in implementing the Party's line and policies in various tasks such as carrying out land reform and protecting industry and commerce, as well as the errors of bureaucracy, formalism, and liberalism in their style. He called on everyone to welcome the Party rectification movement with the greatest enthusiasm and "wash their faces and bask in the sun." Regarding the methods and steps of Party rectification in directly subordinate organs, Comrade Fuchun pointed out that the content of Party rectification in organs should focus on learning, combined with examining thinking, position, and lifestyle, and, when necessary, examining composition, to clarify the historical and social roots of bad ideas, styles, and lifestyles, so as to rectify them. The content of study should focus on Chairman Mao's report, combined with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's summary report at the National Land Conference, and the focus of study should be determined according to different jobs, to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and to connect with actual work. During the study, take turns to participate in land reform and the workers' movement. In addition to those who have already participated, those who remain in the organs can organize rural visiting groups to go to the countryside in rotation for two or three months. Harbin municipal organ branches should combine with workers, with one branch helping one factory, helping workers and learning from workers. The Northeast Bureau has organized a general study committee for directly subordinate organs, and each ministry, commission, and system has established study sub-committees. Starting from February 1st, first spend two months studying documents, combined with examining thinking, position, and style, and then examining work, lifestyle, and composition. The overall goal is to grasp the spirit of Chairman Mao's report, clarify the Party's line and policies, improve thinking, firm up position, adopt a democratic style, live a simple life, and make the Party more closely connected with the people, so that the old cadres can lead the new cadres to fight for the victory of the revolution.

    东北中央局召开哈市机关整党动员大会
    总结整编进行整党
    李富春同志报告
    【新华社东北九日电】中共东北中央局上月二十六日召开哈市机关整党动员大会，出席干部千余名，听取李富春同志“总结整编和进行整党”的报告。富春同志首先指出：哈市机关历时三个月的整编已告一段落，东北局和军区直属各机关以及松江省省级各机关精简人员，共占原有人员的百分之十二，节省住房汽车等甚多，全年可节省开支约十三万万元。精简人员除少数解雇或被清洗外，其余都分别送往前线、地方工场、农场和学校工作，各机关相当严密了组织，确定了编制，建立了办公、生活及学习制度。特别是通过民主大会，发扬了批评和自我批评，反对了贪污浪费，改进了工作和影响后方机关的作风，警惕了大家在城市应当如何工作和生活，这方面的收获比人力物力的节省更大的不可计算。富春同志继谓：在思想作风上，整编还缺乏系统的解决问题，民主批评和自我批评还发扬不够，因此整编只能视为整党的开端。十年来我党由几万党员发展到二百七十万党员，由于党的大发展，有些地主富农流氓分子混进了党，特别在基层组织中表现成份不纯，今天就成了土地改革和革命前进的阻碍。而从思想不纯来看，就不单纯是基层组织的问题，许多干部在新形势下，在执行新任务新政策中表现出了立场不稳和阶级观点模糊，并产生了作风不纯，特别是官僚主义形式主义突出。整党就是为了克服这些毛病。但在东北因为地方党特别是基层组织是新建立的，有的才正在建立，成份与作风不纯对土改的贯彻与否，还不能起决定作用，而且在彻底平分土地以及贫雇农阶级起来时，这些组织可以在运动中求得改造；有决定影响的是老干部，因为他们是新干部的榜样，是党与东北人民密切结合的骨干。因此，东北局决定首先要注意整老干部。至此，富春同志列举有些老干部在进行土改、保护工商业等各种工作中，表现执行党的路线与政策发生左右摇摆的事实，以及作风上的官僚主义、形式主义和自由主义的错误，号召每个人都应以最大热忱欢迎整党运动，洗脸晒太阳。关于直属机关整党的方法和步骤，富春同志指出：机关整党内容应以学习为主，联系查思想、查立场、查生活，必要时查成份，弄清坏思想、作风、生活的历史社会根源，以便整掉。学习内容以毛主席报告为主，结合刘少奇同志在全国土地会议上的总结报告，并根据工作不同决定学习重点，展开批评和自我批评，与实际工作联系。学习中轮流参加土改和工人运动，除已参加者外，留机关者可组织农村参观团，在两三个月内轮流下乡。哈市机关支部与工人结合，一个支部帮助一个工厂，帮助工人并向工人学习。东北局组织直属机关总学委会，各部委、各系统成立学习分委会，从二月一日起先以两个月学习文件，联系查思想、立场、作风，然后查工作、生活、成份。总的目的是要求达到掌握毛主席报告精神，弄清党的路线和政策，提高思想，坚定立场，作风民主，生活朴素，使党与人民更密切结合起来，老干部带起新干部为革命的胜利而奋斗。
