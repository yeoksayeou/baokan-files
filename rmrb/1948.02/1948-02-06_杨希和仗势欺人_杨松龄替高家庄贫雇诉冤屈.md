    Yang Xihe Abuses His Power
    Yang Songling Appeals for Justice for Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers in Gaojia Village

To the Editorial Comrades:

After reading the news in the People's Daily on January 16th about the Wu'an government shielding cadres, I was reminded of the injustice suffered by Gao Wenlu, a poor peasant from Gaojia Village in the tenth district of my county (Ci County). He was harmed by someone connected to the government and other departments who abused their power. This oppressor is named Yang Xihe, an old cadre who had been to Yan'an, served as the district head of the ninth district of Ci County, and as the political commissar of the eleventh district. His current position is unclear. I can cite several instances to prove his persecution of poor peasants and hired laborers:

    1. During the Japanese occupation, he and the then district head, Wu Zenglu, arrested five or six people from his village, all of whom were poor peasants, on suspicion of being traitors. Whether they were or not, I don't know, but Gao Haiqing was beaten to death. I forget the names of the others.
    2. Yang Xihe's fourth elder brother, named Jingzhi, whose full name I forget, used Gao Quancheng's rope net (a type of agricultural tool), for some reason, and one dark night, threw Meng Baizi, a resident of their village, into a well southeast of Changjia Village. The year, month, and day of this event can be thoroughly clarified by asking Gao Quancheng.
    3. Yang Xihe's son, Yang Tingkui, along with his cousin from Jiang Village (whose name I don't know), tied up Gao Wenlu and shot him three or four times with a gun. He was not killed, but thrown into a well east of Zuocheng Village. The next day, Gao Wenlu was found alive and rescued by others. The date of this event can be obtained by asking Gao Wenlu.
    4. Yang Xihe's second sister-in-law is a widow and not very reputable (a loose woman). She married Gao Quancheng from his village, which he disapproved of, feeling it was a disgrace to him. He often sought to harm Gao Quancheng. During the land reform, Yang Xihe used the pretext of struggling against landlords to demand that Gao Quancheng be struggled against and have all his property confiscated. To this day, Gao Quancheng is afraid to live at home and has fled to Ci County City to open a steamed bun shop on Fuju Temple Street.
    5. Last spring, four or five villages struggled against Rong family, a feudal landlord in Xipeng Township. During this struggle, he personally embezzled the majority of the fruits of the struggle that Gaojia Village received, including good land and livestock.
    6. Because Gao Wenlu was a poor peasant with no relatives or friends and no one to back him up, he was controlled by Yang Xihe and made the chairman of the village peasant association. Because the Yang family was the strongest in Gaojia Village, Duan Jilei, a cadre from the tenth district armed work committee stationed in the village at that base point, talked to the peasant association chairman several times after learning about the situation, encouraging him to have the courage to struggle against the Yang family and asking the peasant associations of neighboring military camp villages to provide assistance. As a result, Yang Xihe was persuaded, and he answered the questions raised by the masses. The masses ended up dragging him several yards. This caused a great disaster. District Head Wang Jingsheng and Political Commissar Han Jiuru were both angered by Yang Xihe and insisted that it was a counter-revolutionary sabotage. They brought Gao Wenlu to the Xiangshan District Office, where he was hung up and beaten. To this day, Gao Wenlu is still detained in the detention room of the Ci County Judicial Section, and I don't know if he is alive or dead.

Editorial Comrades: You may not know that Gao Wenlu's family has only his elderly mother, who is over sixty years old, and no one to care for her. Also, Yang Xihe seized all the fruits of the struggle that Gao Wenlu had been given, claiming that Gao Wenlu had embezzled funds as chairman. Gao Wenlu's mother knelt before Yang Xihe, begging him, but Yang Xihe used sweet words to deceive this woman. The reason why no one dares to speak out against Yang Xihe's evil deeds is because of these reasons: Firstly, he had been to Yan'an and lived in school, and no one knows how much power and influence he has; secondly, the current Deputy County Head Wu Heqian, District Head Wang Jingsheng, Political Commissar Han Jiuru, and Sun Haohui all have some private connections with him, and it can be said that Yang Xihe is well-connected with these people; thirdly, he used to be a district head and political commissar, and his nephew and eldest son are both working outside, and no one knows how much influence they have. In short, people are afraid of speaking out about this matter and bringing misfortune upon themselves. I cannot reveal all the details. These are just some of the things I know. To fully understand every aspect of Yang Xihe's affairs, ask Gao Quancheng, ask Gao Wenlu in the judicial section, and ask the poor peasants of Gaojia Village, and you will be able to uncover the truth little by little.

My starting point for writing this is to appeal for justice for the suffering poor peasants and to inform the leadership that some people are taking advantage of the Communist Party and acting recklessly. Yang Xihe's class background is very impure. In my personal opinion, he is from a landlord family (in his village).

In addition, I am clarifying my class background and origin. I come from a poor peasant family, and besides enduring hardship, I participate in work. I am from Junying Village, Ci County, and Yang Sanqian is my father. I work in the third district of Handan and am now in the second team of the southern-bound cadres of the Jinnan Third Special Commissioner's Office, located in Qizhicheng. My name is Yang Songling. If you are unclear about where I wrote from, you can write to me, and I will definitely tell you what I know. If I am transferred, you can find the people I have written about as objects of investigation and understanding. I can provide evidence for everything I have written, and I am responsible for every issue I have raised. I am not writing this recklessly. Otherwise, you can come here to conduct an actual investigation and understanding.

    Yang Songling, written January 23rd

### 杨希和仗势欺人  杨松龄替高家庄贫雇诉冤屈

    杨希和仗势欺人
    杨松龄替高家庄贫雇诉冤屈编辑同志们：
    我看了人民日报一月十六日登了武安政府包庇干部的消息以后，我想起了我县（磁县）第十区高家庄贫农高文禄的冤枉事，他被与政府及其他部门有联系的人仗着势力来残害。这个压迫人的人叫杨希和，是个老干部，到过延安，当过磁县九区区长，当过第十一区政委，现在职务不明。他残害贫雇可举几个事来证明：
    一、日本在时，他与当时的区长吴增禄一同抓了他村五、六个人，都是贫农，据说是汉奸，到底是不是，我不清楚，生把高海青活活地打死，其别人我忘了。
    二、杨希和的四哥叫景至，大名字（字）我忘了，拿高全成的绳络子（是一种农具），不知是因为啥事，在一天黑夜，将在他村住户的孟罢子，扔到常家庄村东南一个井里了，那年那月那日，问高全成即可彻底明白。
    三、杨希和的儿子杨廷魁与蒋村他的表亲，（名字（字）我不知道），两个人将高文禄捆住用枪打了三四枪，未打死，扔到佐城村东井里，第二天高文禄未死，被别人捞出，这个事情年月日问高文禄便知。
    四、杨希和二嫂是寡妇，同时不很好（破鞋），与他村高全成结了婚，他不满意，觉得丢了他的人，他就时常想搞高全成，杨希和趁着土地改革，以斗争地主为名，就非斗争高全成与没收他的全部财产不行，至今吓的高全成不干（敢）在家住，逃到磁县城府君庙街开馍馍房。
    五、在去年春天，四、五个村斗争西彭厢封建大地主荣家，这次斗争，高家庄分到的果实，好地与牲口，他个人大部独吞了。
    六、高文禄因为是个贫农，又没有什么亲戚朋友，更没有什么人当后台，就被杨希和掌握，当了该村农会主任。因为高家庄数了他杨家就没有再比他们强了，当时在这个基点的坐村干部是十区武委会段计雷同志，他了解了一下，就给农会主任谈了几次话，鼓起了斗争杨家的勇气，并叫有军营村农会联合帮助，结果是把杨希和说住了，群众给他提出的问题他都答复了，群众结果是拖了他几丈远，这一下可惹出了大祸，区长王景生、政委韩九如，都给杨希和一气，硬说这是特务捣鬼，把高文禄弄到了香山区公所，吊打了一顿，至今高文禄还被扣在磁县司法科的禁闭室里，现在死活我不清楚。
    编辑同志：你可不知道，高文禄家里只剩老母，已有六十多岁，没人招管，同时高文禄分了点果实，杨希和借口说高文禄当主任有贪污，都收拾了。高文禄母亲跪到杨希和脸前，养（央）告不起，杨希和用巧言花语，哄起了这个女人。杨希和为啥这样的坏没人干（敢）说，是有这几个事：一个是他到过延安，住过学校，别的人说不清他有多大权利，有多大势力；二个是现在的副县长吴合谦、区长王景生与韩政委、孙好会都给他有些私人拉拢，也可以说杨希和到这几个人跟前吃得开；三个是他过去当区长当政委，他侄儿与他大儿都在外工作，也不知有多大势力。总之，是怕说了这事，自己倒霉。详细情形，我不能说出来，这只是我个人所了解的一些，要想弄清杨希和的每一件事情，问高全成，问现在司法科的高文禄，问高家庄的贫农，才会一点一滴弄的清清楚楚。
    我写这个东西的出发点，就是为受罪的贫农申冤告状，叫领导上也知道有些人投共产党的机，胡作乱为。杨希和的成份是很不纯的，以我个人的眼光看，他是地主成份（在他村说）。
    另外，我写明我的成份与出身，我是个贫农出身，除了会受苦，就参加工作。我是磁县军营村人，杨三迁是我的父亲。我在邯郸三区工作，现在是要南下、现在冀南三专署企之城南干部第二队，我叫杨松龄。我写的地方，你们不清楚可来信，我所知道的一定告知。如果我调走了，可找我写的人为调查了解的对像（象）。我所写的，我都能找出证据，同时写的每个问题，我都负责，可不是胡写的，不然的话，你们到这里做实际调查了解。
