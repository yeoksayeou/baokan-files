Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 15th: According to various sources, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities' full-scale monopoly of cotton yarn and cloth in all Chiang-controlled areas has begun to be gradually implemented this month. The "National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee," established by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits last month, has forcibly ordered cotton merchants in the Chiang-occupied cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to sell all their cotton stocks to the committee and to register the production volume of each yarn and cloth factory in order to carry out so-called "unified purchase, unified spinning, unified weaving, and unified sales." At the same time, the committee is also sending an economic secret agent to each factory as a "resident commissioner" to monitor the allocation of raw cotton and the status of processing and weaving. The bureaucratic capitalist China Textile Corporation, disregarding the opposition of cotton merchants in Shanghai, forcibly purchased cotton stocks from merchants there on the 15th of last month. The management committee has also decided to set up "Grade A offices" in six locations including Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Wuxi, and Xi'an, "Grade B offices" in eight locations including Qingdao, Nanjing, Nantong, Hangzhou, Yin County, Wuhu, Shenyang, and Taipei, and "Grade C offices" in three locations including Wu County, Wujin, and Kunming, in preparation for implementing a full-scale monopoly. The Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense has ordered all sea, land, and air forces and all joint logistics headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to "assist in the national cotton yarn and cloth management work at any time." Cotton yarn and cloth manufacturers in various Chiang-controlled areas will therefore face a dead end.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 17th: The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are forcibly "acquiring" items such as wool, galvanized iron, and iron wire among the so-called "unlicensed, self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving in port" previously detained in Shanghai. The Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan passed five "handling principles" regarding wool and other goods at its 11th meeting, stipulating that importers are forced to apply to the (Chiang Kai-shek) government for "acquisition" before the 19th of this month, otherwise "the goods will be confiscated." At the same time, it also ordered that galvanized iron and iron wire be "uniformly acquired by the China Trust Bureau within 30 days, and re-export is not allowed." The "acquisition" price offered by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities is merely a piece of paper, a so-called "special foreign currency deposit certificate" to be paid in six installments over three years, which is effectively equivalent to depriving importers of all their operating capital.

　　蒋匪全面垄断花纱布
  　私营厂商走头无路
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据各方消息：蒋匪当局对全蒋区花纱布的全面垄断，本月起已开始逐步付诸实施。蒋匪于上月成立的“全国花纱布管理委员会”已强令苏、浙、皖三省蒋占城市棉商将其全部存棉售予该会，并登记各纱布厂生产量，以便进行所谓“统购、统纺、统织、统销”。同时该会并在各厂派一经济特务为“驻厂专员”，以监视各厂原棉分配及代纺代织生产状况。蒋匪官僚资本中纺公司已于上月十五日不顾上海各棉商之反对，在该地强购棉商存棉。该管委会并已决定在汉、津、穗、渝、无锡、西安等六地，设置“甲等办事处”，在青岛、南京、南通、杭州、鄞县、芜湖、沈阳、台北等八地，设置“乙等办事处”，在吴县、武进、昆明等三地，设置“丙等办事处”，准备实行全面垄断。蒋匪国防部已下令蒋匪所有海、陆、空军及各联勤总部“随时协助进行全国花纱布管理工作”。蒋区各地花纱布厂商将因此面临绝境。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋匪当局强迫“收购”前被扣留在沪的所谓“无证自备外汇到埠货品”中之羊毛、镀锌、铅丝等项，蒋匪行政院十一日会议通过关于羊毛等项货品“处理原则”五项，规定强迫进口商于本月十九日以前向（蒋匪）政府申请“收购”，否则“货物予以没收”。同时，并复命令镀锌及铅丝两项货物于三十天以内“一律由中信局收购，不准重运出口”。蒋匪当局“收购”代价仅为一纸，以三年分六期付齐之所谓“特种外币存单”，实际等于剥夺进口商之全部营业资本。
