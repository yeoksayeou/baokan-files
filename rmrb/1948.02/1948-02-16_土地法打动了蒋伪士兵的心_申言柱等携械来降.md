    The Land Law Touches the Hearts of Chiang Kai-shek's Soldiers
    Shen Yanzhu and Others Defect with Weapons
    [Taihang News] In the second district of Ye County last month, the political offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and puppet troops was actively carried out, and the Land Law was vigorously promoted, which has accurately hit the minds of many soldiers among the local tyrants, bandits, and puppet soldiers. On the evening of January 24, Shen Yanzhu and Zhang Fu, soldiers under the command of Wang Ziquan, a stubborn puppet soldier, took the initiative to defect to our district with one machine gun and more than 380 rounds of ammunition. Bai Yinzhu, also from the same unit, brought his own rifle to join us. The Second District Headquarters, in accordance with the regulations of the democratic government on rewarding Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who defect with weapons, awarded them 100,000 yuan in silver dollars; Bai Yinzhu also received 10,000 yuan in silver dollars at the same time.
