    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: The reorganization movement of organs in Harbin City has concluded after two months of democratic discussion. The Northeast Bureau has issued unified regulations covering personnel allocation, living standards, transportation, recreational activities, study systems, etc. (This telegram was published on page one of this newspaper on January 9th - editor). This reorganization is significant as it specifically addresses the issue of organ reorganization after entering a city. As the People's Liberation Army transitions to the offensive, many cities will be liberated, and the entry of the New Democratic regime into cities will become an important characteristic of future development. This situation will present us with a series of new problems that must be properly resolved. We still lack the necessary experience to deal with these problems. The success of the Harbin City organ reorganization movement is therefore worthy of attention, precisely for this reason.

    Cities have concentrated populations, developed transportation, and complete living facilities. Utilizing these conditions effectively, on the positive side, can better serve the people and the war effort. On the negative side, it can reduce the burden on the people and channel saved manpower, materials, and financial resources towards winning the war and advancing construction. However, due to the long-term rule of imperialism and feudal forces in cities, extremely decadent lifestyles have developed there. If resolute steps are not taken ideologically and organizationally to overcome this sinful temptation, phenomena such as corruption, extravagance, hedonism, and disparities in living standards will be more likely to arise and develop than in rural areas. This would negate all the benefits of cities, leaving only the drawbacks. The impact of these drawbacks would be sufficient to corrupt the revolutionary ranks, hinder the victory of the war and the progress of construction work, and even lead to the failure of the revolution. Therefore, every Communist Party member should have a clear understanding when entering a city: their task is to work, not to enjoy comfort. They should work with the urban people and rely on them to transform the city; the acquisition of the city should have a positive impact on the revolution, not a negative one.

    The unified regulations of the Northeast Bureau state: "The treatment of all cadres must be based on the living standards of middle peasants in rural areas and skilled workers in urban areas and must not exceed them." This is an important principle that should be followed not only in cities but also in rural areas; not only during wartime but also at all times. The life of a Communist Party member should only improve with the improvement of the lives of the general public. They have no right to live better than the general public, and they are absolutely not allowed to lead a wasteful and decadent life like bureaucratic compradors, landlords, and capitalists. The unified regulations also state: "A ten-hour work-study system shall be implemented, with eight hours of work and two hours of study per day." This is also an important principle. Communist Party members and revolutionaries should take advantage of the favorable conditions in cities to work hard and study diligently, rather than becoming parasites.

    The unified regulations of the Northeast Bureau, regarding saving personnel and transportation, recreational activities, and fixed office hour systems, when implemented in cities, will not only not reduce work efficiency but will instead increase it. These changes are necessary when moving from rural areas to cities. As the Northeast Daily editorial stated, it is absolutely unacceptable to "remain stuck in the dispersion of rural life while being tainted by the superficiality of the city, wasting a lot of manpower and resources." According to news from the Northeast last November, the headquarters of the Democratic United Army (i.e., the current Northeast People's Liberation Army) implemented streamlining, reducing the number of guards and communicators by more than half, drastically reducing dormitories, cars, and electric lights and telephones, and implementing a fixed work and reception system. As a result, relations between superiors and subordinates and among each other became closer. The Northeast Railway Protection Army Command reduced its personnel by one-third, but work efficiency doubled. These systems, such as fixed work hours and fixed reception hours, are not feasible in rural areas, but in cities, after order has been stabilized, they can and must be implemented. As for the streamlining of personnel and transportation, it can and must be implemented appropriately both in rural and urban areas.

    The Northeast Daily editorial pointed out that the purpose of the Harbin City organ reorganization is to: "Strengthen organization, unify establishment, improve systems, increase work efficiency, establish a hard-working and simple style, oppose corruption and waste, so that the use of all our manpower, materials, and financial resources, and the style of all our thoughts, work, and life, can adapt to the needs of large-scale warfare." This should be done not only in Harbin City but also in all liberated areas without exception. One of the strategic goals of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was to destroy the manpower and resources of the liberated areas, causing them to wither, in order to defeat the People's Liberation Army. The transition of the People's Liberation Army to the offensive and the launch of the land reform movement in the liberated areas have foiled this conspiracy of the Chiang bandits. Faced with the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the inevitable demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is certain. However, we must also prepare for a protracted war, and we must prepare everything to overcome the maximum resistance of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with the aid of American imperialism in order to achieve complete victory. Recently, the East China Central Bureau decided on streamlining and cleaning-up methods, and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region is carrying out the same work. This work has been going on for several months in the Jin-Sui and Shaan-Gan-Ning border regions, and these are all very necessary. Not only is this the case in the old liberated areas, but in the newly liberated areas of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, Generals Liu and Deng also called on the People's Liberation Army and local cadres to establish a style and atmosphere of hard work and simplicity, seeking truth from facts, and doing good things for the masses, and to oppose boastfulness, waste, luxury, and extravagance, and not doing good things for the masses. This call is also absolutely necessary for creating new liberated areas and defeating the Chiang bandits. Carrying out reorganization and cleaning-up work together with land reform, party rectification movements, and production and construction will further consolidate the rear of the People's Liberation Army, promote its great strength in supporting the front, and guarantee the complete victory of the just war of the Chinese people against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

### 整顿后方机关帮助前线胜利

    整顿后方机关帮助前线胜利
    据新华社东北六日电：哈尔滨市各机关整编运动，经过两个月的民主讨论，已经结束，东北局发布了统一规定，其中有人员编制、生活制度、交通用具、娱乐工作、学习制度等项（该电载本报一月九日一版——编者）。这次整编很有意义，具体解决了进入城市之后，机关整编的问题。人民解放军转入进攻，许多城市将被解放，新民主主义政权进入城市，将要成为今后发展的一个重要特点，这种情形将使我们遇到一连串新的问题，必须予以妥善解决。面对于这些问题，我们还缺乏必要的经验，哈尔滨市机关整编运动的成功，所以值得重视，其原因就在这里。
    城市人口集中，交通发达，生活设备齐全，善于利用这些条件，积极方面就可以更好的为人民服务，为战争服务；消极方面，就可以减轻人民负担，并把节省下来的人力、物力、财力，用到争取战争胜利，和推进建设工作的方面去。但是另一方面，由于城市经过了帝国主义与封建势力的长期统治，那里发展了极其恶劣的糜烂的生活，如果不能坚决的在思想上和在组织上，采取步骤，克服这种罪恶的诱惑，则贪污腐化、铺张浪费、太平享乐、生活悬殊等等现象，比之在农村中更容易产生和发展，那就是取消了城市的一切好处，剩下的只有坏处。这种坏处发生作用，足以腐化革命队伍，足以妨碍战争的胜利与建设工作的进行，足以使革命失败。所以每个共产党员，在到城市里去的时候，应当有明确的认识：他的任务应该是去工作，而不是去享福，他应当与城市人民一起，并依靠城市人民来改造城市；不是使城市的取得，对于革命发生坏作用，而是使城市的取得，对于革命发生好作用。
    东北局的统一规定中说：“一切干部待遇，务须做到以农村中的中农与城市中的技术工人生活为标准，不得超过”。这是一条重要的原则性的规定，不仅在城市中应当遵守，在乡村中也应当遵守；不仅在战时应当如此，任何时候都应当如此。共产党员的生活，只能随人民大众生活的提高而提高，没有权利比人民大众生活得更好，更决不允许去过官僚买办地主资本家浪费糜烂的生活。统一规定中又说：“一律实行十小时工作学习制，每天八小时工作，二小时学习”，这也是重要的原则性的规定。共产党员与革命者，应当利用城市的便利条件，多做工作，好好学习，而不是去做寄生虫。
    东北局的统一规定中，关于节省人员和交通工具，关于娱乐和定时办公制度等项，在城市中实行，不但不会减少工作效能，相反的会增加工作效能，从乡村到城市，这些改变是必要的，诚如东北日报社论所说，决不能“既停留于农村生活的分散性，却又染着城市的浮华，浪费不少人力物力”。据东北去年十一月消息，民主联军（即现东北人民解放军）总部实行精简，警卫员及通讯员，减少二分之一以上，宿舍汽车及电灯电话，大量缩减，实行定时工作与定时接待制，结果上下及相互间关系更加密切。东北铁路护路军司令部，减去人员三分之一，工作效能反而倍增。这些制度，其中如定时工作、定时接待制，在乡村中是行不通的，但在城市中，在秩序既经稳定之后，是可以而且必需实行的。至于人员与交通工具的精简等，即在乡村中，亦同样可以而且必需适当的实行。
    东北日报社论，指出哈市机关整编的目的是：“严密组织、统一编制、健全制度、提高工作效率、建立艰苦朴实作风，反对贪污浪费，使我们的一切人力、物力、财力的使用，一切思想、工作、生活的作风，都能适应大规模战争的要求”。这不但在哈市一地应该做到，一切解放区毫无例外都应当做到。蒋介石匪帮战略目的之一，曾是摧毁解放区的人力、物力，使之枯竭，这样来战胜人民解放军。人民解放军的转入进攻与解放区土地改革运动的开展，使蒋匪的这一阴谋失败了。蒋介石匪帮在人民解放军胜利进攻的面前，其必然覆没，已是肯定无疑的了。但还必须准备长期战争，还必须准备一切以克服蒋介石匪帮在美国帝国主义援助之下的最大限度的抵抗，才能取得彻底胜利。最近华东中央局决定精简清理办法，晋冀鲁豫正在进行同样工作，晋绥及陕甘宁边区的这项工作，则已经进行数月，这些都是很必要的。不但在老解放区是这样，在鄂豫皖新解放区，刘邓两将军亦号召人民解放军和地方干部，树立艰苦朴素、实事求是，给群众办好事的作风和风气，反对浮夸浪费、奢侈铺张，不给群众作好事的作风和风气。这种号召，对于创造新解放区与战胜蒋匪，也是完全必要的。整编清理工作与土地改革、整党运动、生产建设一齐进行，将更进一步巩固人民解放军的后方，发扬其支援前线的伟大力量，保证我国人民对蒋介石匪帮的正义战争，进行到彻底的胜利。          （新华社陕北三十一日电）
