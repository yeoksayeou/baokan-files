Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th -- *Jin Bao* reports: Under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' policy of strangling national industry, the flour industry, an industrial center in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of North China, is facing a complete shutdown crisis. The Tianjin Flour Trade Association has eleven members: Shoufeng, Fuxing, Fufeng, Yitai, Tianguang, Yufeng, Yuanxingyi, Zengxinghou, Huaxing, Zhengda, and Dongya. The largest, Shoufeng, has over sixty steel mills. Its peak output used to be 15,000 bags per day, or 390,000 bags per month. But by December, it had fallen to 11,749 bags, less than its previous daily output, a reduction of more than thirty times. Fuxing Flour Company also has a long history, with eighteen steel mills. Its past monthly output was 130,000 bags. Last December, it reduced production to 10,695 bags, a reduction of slightly less than thirteen times its regular output. At the end of the year, it announced a complete shutdown. Dongya is a newly established flour mill. Last November, it produced more than 74,000 bags of flour, but in December, it suddenly dropped to 320 bags. Zengxinghou and Huaxing have not been in operation for the past year. Tianguang factory only operated once in September last year. Currently, Shoufeng, Dongya, Yitai, Yufeng, and other manufacturers are struggling to survive by grinding corn flour to maintain daily expenses, but they still feel the difficulties and face the danger of shutdown.

    蒋匪绞杀民营面粉工业
    天津面厂临停顿危机
    【新华社陕北六日电】津报讯：在蒋匪绞杀民族工业政策下，华北蒋区工业中心天津面粉工业已面临全部停顿危机。该市面粉同业公会共有会员十一家，即寿丰、福星、福丰、益泰、天光、裕丰、元兴义、增兴厚、华兴、正达、东亚。最大一家的寿丰有钢磨六十余座，该厂过去的最高产量每天曾达一万五千袋，每月三十九万袋。但至十二月份已降至一万一千七百四十九袋，不及过去一日产量，较以前减少三十余倍。福星面粉公司历史亦较悠久，有钢磨十八座，过去月产十三万袋，去年十二月份减产至一万零六百九十五袋，较其经常产量，减低十三倍弱，年底复宣告全部停工。东亚是一家新办的面粉厂，去年十一月份尚产粉七万四千余袋，至十二月份即突降至三百二十袋。增兴厚、华兴两家，过去一年来即未曾开工。天光厂仅在去年九月份开过一次磨。目前寿丰、东亚、益泰、裕丰等厂家为苟延残喘，改磨玉米面，维持日常开支仍感困难，亦面临停顿危险。
