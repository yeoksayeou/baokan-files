Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: Late News: The East China Military Region issued a land reform order on December 15th of last year, with the following summary:

    I. All army personnel should intensify their land reform studies, correctly understand and grasp the spirit of the Outline Land Law of China. Participate in the Speak Bitterness and Revenge movement, raise class consciousness, and no one is allowed to stand outside of this study movement.
    II. Actively support all the legitimate demands and just actions of the peasant masses, and closely integrate various forms of armed struggle with the land reform movement, especially armed forces and local armed forces (including militia) in border areas adjacent to the enemy, should actively eliminate or strike at enemy offensives and disturbances in order to cover the land reform struggle. Strictly suppress the conspiracies and sabotage activities of feudal forces and bandit special agents.
    III. All rear service units, organs, and schools should organize village work committees and land reform work teams (selecting cadres with necessary work experience, a better mass perspective, better class composition, and a clearer class stance to participate). Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, actively participate in the land reform movement and the anti-espionage and anti-traitor struggle. Temper the ideological consciousness of every cadre, party member, and soldier in the torrent of land reform, making them strong proletarian fighters.
    IV. Cadres who come from landlord or rich peasant backgrounds or whose families are landlords or rich peasants should resolutely abandon their original class stance. First, they should set an example by handing over their land and property to the peasants for disposal (treating themselves the same as the peasants). After unsuccessful persuasion of reactionary landlord and rich peasant families, they should resolutely sever all ideological and economic ties with them.
    V. Worker-peasant cadres should not forget their roots, and should constantly persuade their landlord and rich peasant wives, families, relatives, and friends to strictly draw class lines; there must be no favoritism or protectionism under the guise of public interest.
    VI. Military dependents, families of martyrs, and honorary soldiers should be respected and loved by the broad masses of the people. However, in land issues, they can only receive the same amount of land as the basic masses. Any extra land received in the past should also be automatically handed over to the peasant association for redistribution. No special treatment should be requested in land distribution issues.
    VII. Those sons and daughters and their families of landlord and rich peasant elements who have infiltrated the army, organs, factories, and hospitals as air-raid shelters in the land reform in order to escape the peasant struggle should be immediately and unconditionally purged once these bad elements are discovered.
    VIII. Those who can abide by the above articles in the land reform movement and achieve effective results should be given certain commendations and rewards; otherwise, they should be severely criticized and punished, and in severe cases, expelled from the Party and military and handed over to the local peasant association for handling.
