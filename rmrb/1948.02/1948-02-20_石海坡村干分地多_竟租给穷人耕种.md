(Jinan News) In Stone Sea Slope Village, Wu Yi County, poor peasants have not truly turned over because bad village cadres have become large boulders, suppressing the poor and hired peasants. These bad village cadres shelter landlords, seize excessive fruits of labor, and engage in corruption and embezzlement. Their backgrounds are complex, and they are lazy and gluttonous; even some with good class backgrounds have forgotten their roots. During last year's mass movement, before the struggle even began, landlords took turns treating the cadres to banquets, resulting in a very incomplete struggle, with many escaping the net. Ma Longxiang, the Farmers' Association director, used the wood from the fruits of labor to make a coffin for himself. Village cadre Guo Juyue used the bricks from the fruits of labor to build three large northern-style rooms and a gatehouse. Village cadres also used money from the fruits of labor to hire people to transport livestock, dividing the profits among themselves. Village cadres divided the good land and couldn't finish farming it, so they rented the rest to poor people. Poor peasant martyr Wei Laoqi said, "They divided the bad land to us, the family members of soldiers, but the cadres got the good land and couldn't finish farming it. Wei Huachang (village chief) hired a long-term worker this year. We rented four mu of their land to grow melons, and five bags of grain were only planted for one season." Poor peasants Zhang Qiu and others still don't have a house or a piece of land, and they all say, "We poor fellows worked for nothing all winter, just to make up numbers in meetings, staying up late and enduring the cold, but we didn't get anything when dividing things." Village chief Wei Huachang and Wei Guanyi cannot get through a day without drinking two jin of liquor, consuming sixty-seven jin just at Guo Qi's tavern. Once, when an old ox died in the village, the village cadres used a slaughter permit to slaughter four fat oxen, feasting and drinking for several days. When they collected public grain, they demanded more grain from the masses. For example, Guo Yutong handed in a bag of wheat, which was weighed at 116 jin at the time. The next day, when it was sent to the warehouse, the original bag was untouched, but it weighed 126 jin. Therefore, after handing in the required amount of grain to the warehouse, there was still a lot of wheat left over. The masses comforted the new soldiers with 400,000 yuan, but the village cadres didn't give it to them. The village cadres also privately fined villagers for some things, and now there is no record of it. The cadres are so corrupt and wasteful that the masses don't dare to say anything. When someone asks, the masses say, "The cadres are all good!"

    石海坡村干分地多
    竟租给穷人耕种
    【冀南消息】武邑石海坡贫农没有翻身，主要原因是坏村干成了大石头，把贫雇农压住了。这些坏村干掩护地主，多占果实，贪污腐化。他们出身复杂、好吃懒做，有些成份好的也忘了本。去年群众运动时，在没有斗争以前，地主们就轮流请干部的客，因此斗的很不彻底，还有好多漏网的。农会主任马龙骧用果实木头作了寿木，村干郭居月用果实砖盖了三间大北屋、一间门楼。村干部还用果实钱雇人贩牲口，赚了钱分赃。村干部分的好地种不完，剩下的租给穷人。贫农烈属魏老七说：“把坏地分给俺抗属，好地干部分的种不清，魏华昌（村长）今年雇上长活，咱租了他们四亩地种瓜，五口袋谷子只种一季。”贫农张秋等仍是房没一间地没一垄，都说：“咱这穷小子们白和人家闹了一冬天，凑数开会，熬眼挨冻，分东西没有咱”。村长魏华昌和魏贯一一天不喝二斤酒过不去，光在郭起酒馆就喝了六十七斤。有一回村里死了一头老牛，村干部跟着用一个宰杀证宰了四头肥牛，吃喝了好些日子。他们征公粮时，多向群众要粮食，比如郭玉同缴了一口袋麦子，当时过秤说是一百十六斤，第二天向仓库里送时，原口袋一点没有动，过了一百二十六斤。因此向仓库里缴清应征的，还剩下好多麦子。群众慰劳了新战士四十万元，村干都没有给。村干部还私自罚了村民一些东西，现在全没头绪。干部们这样贪污浪费，群众都不敢吭，有人打听，群众就说：“干部们都不错！”
