    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: Soviet Finance Minister Zverev presented the largest budget draft in the history of the Soviet Union's peacetime, for the year 1948, at the joint session of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet on January 31st. The total expenditure is estimated at 387.9 billion rubles, and the total revenue reaches 428 billion rubles. Zverev reported that the implementation of last year's budget resulted in a surplus of 24 billion rubles after offsetting revenue and expenditure. In this year's new budget, the revenue exceeds the expenditure by a huge amount of 40.1 billion rubles. These figures fully demonstrate the strong power of the Soviet social system and its financial system. In this year's new budget draft, the funds allocated to the national economy and social and cultural undertakings account for 68 percent of the total expenditure, compared to only 66 percent last year. Defense expenditure accounts for only 17 percent, totaling 66 billion rubles, which is 2.5 billion rubles more than last year, when it accounted for 18 percent. Zverev continued to prove the cultural development of the Soviet people with moving figures, saying: "This year, the expenditure on national education will increase to 59.1 billion rubles, and the total number of students will increase to 35 million; among them, the number of students in higher education institutions will increase to 722,000, which has exceeded the figure originally planned for 1950 in the Five-Year Plan. This year, the expenditure on public health will also increase to 20.5 billion rubles." Zverev also pointed out: "In order to help and accelerate the development of the national economy, we will vigorously develop research and investigation work this year, and its expenditure will increase by 7 percent compared with last year." These figures eloquently illustrate the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party's keen concern for improving the lives of the Soviet working people. Stalin himself attended Zverev's report, and the delegates unanimously greeted him with warm cheers as he strode into the venue.

    苏财长提出本年度预算草案
    收入盈余四百亿卢布
    充分证明社会主义雄厚力量
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联财政部长兹维列夫，上月三十一日在最高苏维埃两院联席会议上，提出苏联和平年代历史上最大的一九四八年度预算草案，计岁出总额为三千八百七十九亿卢布，岁入总额达四千二百八十亿卢布。兹维列夫报告指出：去年预算执行经过，收支相抵盈余达二百四十亿卢布。而在今年新预算中，收入超过支出竟达四百零一亿卢布之巨，这些数字充分证明苏维埃社会制度及其财政制度的雄厚力量。今年新预算草案中规定拨归国民经济与社会、文化事业的经费，占岁出总额百分之六十八，去年仅为百分之六十六。而国防经费仅占百分之十七，总数达六百六十亿卢布，去年则占百分之十八，比今年尚多二十五亿卢布。兹维列夫继续以动人的数字证明苏联人民的文化发展称：“今年国民教育经费将增至五百九十一亿卢布，在学学生总数将增至三千五百万人；其中高等学校学生将增至七十二万二千人，已超过五年计划原定在一九五○年达到的数字。今年公共卫生事业经费，亦将增至二百零五亿卢布。”兹氏并指出：“为帮助并加速国民经济的发展，今年将大力发展调查研究工作，其经费将较去年增加百分之七。”这些数字雄辩地说明了苏维埃政府与布尔什维克党对提高苏联劳动人民生活的热切关怀。兹维列夫报告时，斯大林亦亲自出席，当他健步走入会场时，与会代表一致报以热烈欢呼。
