    ★ In Shidong Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, a few cadres monopolize everything and act recklessly, so the common people say this village is a "democracy of ten households." The cadres and landlords are very close, and the poor and hired peasants are in a bad position; they are easily deprived of their right to speak. Now everyone demands to be the master and to thoroughly turn things over.
    ★ Changfan Village in Ci County is a poor village that has not received much attention from the county or district in the past. The fruits of the struggle since the anti-奸 and liquidation have been monopolized by the cadres. The leader who embezzled the fruits was replaced by the district.
    ★ Our People's Liberation Army in Guandong captured Liaoyang County, south of Shenyang, and after eliminating 10,000 enemies, the Jiang family's dog officials in Shenyang were terrified. Several thousand bastards scrambled to take planes and flee for their lives, creating a chaotic mess.

    大众黑板
    ★武安九区石洞村几个干部包办一切，胡作乱干，老百姓说这村是“十家民主”。干部和地主拉得很紧，贫雇的地质很不好，动不动就被取消说话权，现在大家要求当家翻透。
    ★磁县常范村是个穷苦小村，过去县上区上都不大注意，反奸清算以来的斗争果实，都让干部独吞了。领头贪污果实的，区上将他撤换了。
    ★咱们关东的解放军打下沈阳南边的辽阳县城，消灭一万敌人以后，沈阳城里的蒋家狗官们都吓慌啦，几千个王八旦抢着坐飞机逃命，乱成一团牛毛。
