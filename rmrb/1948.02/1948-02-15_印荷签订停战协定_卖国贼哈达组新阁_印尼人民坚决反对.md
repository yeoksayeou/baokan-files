Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Comprehensive reports: The Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, which began on December 6th of last year on the American ship "Renville," have come to an end. Under the "constant pressure" of the American and Belgian representatives of the "Three-Nation Mediation Committee," the Indonesian side was forced to accept the Dutch terms on truce and settlement of political disputes on the 17th of last month, and officially signed the agreement. The content of the armistice includes a ceasefire in place, recognizing the Van Mook Line of August 29th of last year as the basis for establishing a demilitarized zone, which is maintained by Dutch and Indonesian civil police. The ceasefire order came into effect two weeks after the signing, i.e., January 31st. The main principles for resolving political disputes include: (1) The Kingdom of the Netherlands continues to exercise sovereignty over the territory of the East Indies and establish a provisional joint government until the establishment of the United States of Indonesia, after which it will be transferred; (2) The United States of Indonesia is a sovereign and independent state, on an equal footing with the Netherlands in the Netherlands-Indonesian Federation; (3) The Republic of Indonesia participates in the United States of Indonesia and other member states on an equal footing; (4) Within six months to one year after the signing of the agreement, a "referendum" will be held on the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Madura to decide whether the people there will join the Republic of Indonesia or participate in other autonomous states; (5) A constitutional assembly will be established in a "democratic" manner to draft the constitution of the United States of Indonesia.

According to Agence France-Presse: The representatives of the Republic of Indonesia signed the agreement only after receiving clarification from the "Mediation Committee" regarding the rights of the Republic to retain independent military forces, autonomous financial institutions, and dispatch independent diplomatic envoys, and after obtaining guarantees of the above rights from the American representative of the "Mediation Committee," Graham; however, the Belgian representative, Chillon, disclaimed any knowledge of the above explanation. According to a report from the Central News Agency in Batavia, after the American representative, Graham, flew to Yogyakarta on January 24th to meet with President Sukarno and the new Prime Minister Hatta, the "Mediation Committee" issued a communique on the evening of the 25th stating that regarding the Indonesian government's recognition of Dutch sovereignty, the Indonesian government claimed that Indonesia could maintain diplomatic autonomy, issue currency, and maintain its military. However, after negotiations in Yogyakarta, the Indonesian President sent a letter to the Chairman of the Mediation Committee (Graham) confirming that the Indonesian government had unconditionally accepted the six political principles.

Batavia's press circles expressed indignation at this kind of "mediation" and declared: The "Three-Nation Mediation Committee" is a weapon of Wall Street's conspiracy to enslave Indonesia and seize Indonesian raw materials. The committee has helped the Dutch imperialists consolidate their position and opened the way for Wall Street's expansion into Indonesia. Batavia newspapers also revealed that the U.S. State Department is currently considering including Indonesia in the Marshall Plan. American monopoly capital has significantly increased its investment in the islands of Bangka and Belitung (both in eastern Sumatra). Large quantities of zinc, tin, and lead extracted there are now being shipped to the United States. In addition, the United States is drafting a massive plan with the Netherlands to build airports and other facilities for use by the United States on the Indonesian archipelago. The plan will begin in early February and be completed in June.

According to the original plan of the American and Dutch imperialists, the "Federal Council of Indonesia" was established on January 13th to unite the eleven puppet governments outside the Republic of Indonesia and accelerate the organization of the "Provisional Federal Indonesia." On the 24th, the Dutch authorities held a "referendum" on Madura Island. Batavia newspapers said that this vote was an anti-democratic vote and described the vote as follows: In the 2,000 villages on Madura Island, each resident listened to personnel sent by the Dutch read out a decision stating that the relationship between Madura Island and the Republic had been severed since November 11th of last year, and since November 21st, Madura had become an "autonomous territory cooperating with the Batavia central government." Therefore, all men over the age of eighteen were invited to decide whether they were willing for Madura to become an "independent country" in the Indonesian Federation. As a result of this vote, it is said that 180,000 out of 290,000 people approved of the so-called "independent country."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Yogyakarta News: The pro-American, right-wing compromise cabinet of Indonesia was officially established on the 31st of last month. It is reported that Prime Minister Hatta cooperated with the Japanese during the Japanese occupation period and participated in the work of the "Indonesian Independence Preparatory Committee"; former Foreign Minister Salim remained in office. In the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, he welcomed the puppet representatives of East Indonesia. Sukiman, the leader of the Islamic Party, served as the Minister of Interior of the new cabinet. He praised the American tool, the "Three-Nation Mediation Committee," as "friends of the nation." This cabinet did not include any leaders of Indonesian left-wing political parties. The cabinet members are all from the Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party, and some non-partisan figures, purely a right-wing cabinet. According to Indonesian Antara News Agency, Hatta succumbed to American pressure and has recruited extremely reactionary pro-American elements into the cabinet. Broad sections of the Indonesian people oppose this government and demand the restoration of the Sjarifuddin government. Mass rallies and demonstrations were held in various Indonesian towns. The well-known democratic leader Suruso addressed a crowd of 100,000, saying that the 70 million people of Indonesia demand complete freedom and oppose any form of colonial imperialism. Batavia's press pointed out that Graham, the American representative of the Three-Nation Mediation Committee, had lengthy secret negotiations with reactionary leaders within the Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party, who have become reliable fortresses for Wall Street's expansionist policy in Indonesia. These messages from Indonesia illustrate the fact that the recent withdrawal of seven Islamic Party members from the Sjarifuddin cabinet was merely a means of representing "American pressure." They used this to force the Sjarifuddin cabinet to resign, so that pro-American elements could take power. This conspiracy of American imperialism has obviously been fiercely opposed by the broad masses of the Indonesian people.

    印荷签订停战协定
    卖国贼哈达组新阁
    印尼人民坚决反对
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合报导：于去年十二月六日开始在美舰“伦维尔”号上面举行的荷兰印尼之间的谈判，已经告一段落。在“三国调停委员会”美、比代表的“经常压力”之下，印尼方面被迫于上月十七日接受荷方关于停战与解决政治纠纷的条款，并正式签字。停战协定的内容，包括就地停战，承认去年八月二十九日之穆克分界线为设置非军事化地区之基础，该地区由荷印双方民警维持秩序，停战令于签字后两星期，即上月三十一日开始生效。解决政治纠纷的主要原则，包括：（一）荷兰王国继续在东印度领土上行使主权，成立临时联合政府，直至印尼合众国成立后然后移交；（二）印尼合众国为主权独立国家，在荷兰印尼联邦中与荷兰处于同等地位；（三）印尼共和国参加印尼合众国与其他参加会员国之各邦地位平等；（四）协定签署后六个月至一年之内，在爪哇、苏门答腊、马都拉三岛举行“全民投票”，以决定该处人民并入印尼共和国或参加其他自治邦；（五）以“民主”方式成立立宪会议，草拟印尼合众国宪法。
    据法新社讯：印尼共和国代表自“调停委员会”接获关于共和国将保有独立军队、财政机构自主及派遣独自之外交使节诸权利之解释，并自“调委会”美代表格拉罕获得上述权利之保证后，始在协定上签字；但比利时代表齐兰对上述解释则推诿不知。又据中央社巴城讯，美代表格拉罕一月二十四日飞往日惹，与苏加诺总统及新总理哈达晤谈后，二十五日晚“调委会”发表公报称：关于印尼共和国政府承认荷兰主权一节，印尼政府声称：印尼得保持外交自主、发行通货，保存军队等权利。但在日惹方面商谈后，印尼总统今致函调委会主席（格拉罕），证实印尼政府已无条件接受六项政治原则。
    巴城新闻界人士对此种“调处”表示愤懑；并宣称：“三国调委会”乃华尔街阴谋奴役印尼及夺取印尼原料之武器。该委员会帮助了荷兰帝国主义者巩固其地位；并为华尔街对印尼的扩张开辟了道路。巴城报纸同时透露：美国国务院现正考虑将印尼包括于马歇尔计划之中。美国独占资本已显著地增加在邦加、勿里洞（都在苏门答腊东）各岛的投资。该处开采之大量锌、锡、铅，现正运往美国。此外，美国正与荷兰草拟一庞大计划，在印尼群岛上建立供给美国使用之机场等。计划将于二月初开始，六月完成。
    根据美荷帝国主义者的原定计划，“印尼联邦委员会”已于一月十三日成立，以纠合印尼共和国以外之十一个傀儡政府，加速组织“印尼临时联邦”。二十四日荷兰当局在马都拉岛举行了“公民投票”，巴城报纸谓此次投票，系反民主的投票，并如此描写着这次投票道：马都拉岛二千个村庄，每个居民都听着荷兰派出的人员，念读一项决定，其中称：马都拉岛与共和国间的关系，已自去年十一月十一日起断绝，自十一月二十一日起，马都拉即成为“与巴达维亚中央政府合作的自治领”。因此，凡十八岁以上的男子，均被邀决定是否愿意马都拉在印尼联邦中成为“独立国”。这样表决结果，据说二十九万人中有十八万人赞成了所谓“独立国”。
    【新华社陕北十日电】日惹讯：印尼亲美的右冀妥协内阁，已于上月三十一日正式成立。据悉，总理哈达曾在日寇占领时期与日寇合作，参加“印尼独立筹备委员会”的工作；前内阁外长沙立姆仍然留任，他在此次荷印谈判中，曾对于东印尼的傀儡代表表示欢迎。回教党的领袖苏基曼担任新阁内政部长，他曾经称颂美国的工具——“三国调停委员会”为“民族的朋友”。这个内阁没有包括任何一个印尼左冀政党领袖在内，阁员都是回教党和国民党人及若干无党派人士，纯为清一色的右派内阁。据印尼安塔拉通讯社消息，哈达对美国压力屈服，已网罗极反动集团内亲美分子入阁。印尼人民中广大阶层均反对此一政府；并要求恢复沙利佛丁政府。印尼各城镇均举行群众大会及示威游行。著名民主领袖苏尔索向十万群众演说称：印尼七千万人民要求完全自由，反对任何形式的殖民帝国主义。巴达维亚报界人士指出：三国调停委员会美国代表格拉罕，曾与回教党及国民党内的反动领袖进行长时间的秘密谈判，后者已成为华尔街在印尼扩张政策之可靠堡垒。这些来自印尼的消息，说明了一个事实，日前七名回教党人退出沙利佛丁内阁之举，不过是代表“美国的压力”之一种手段，他们以此来迫使沙利佛丁内阁辞职，使亲美分子得以执政。美国帝国主义的这一阴谋，显然已遭到广大印尼人民的激烈反对。
