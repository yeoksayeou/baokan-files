　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Manila dispatch: With the full support of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, the anti-Chinese policy of the Filipino traitor Roxas has intensified. Following last year's "Filipinization of Labor Act," he recently implemented the so-called "Filipinization of Vendors Act," forcibly taking over 1,182 Chinese stalls in Manila. On the 21st of last month, 24 Chinese stalls in Manila were forced to relocate. Many other Chinese stallholders, refusing to comply with this reactionary decree, were driven away by police. On the 11th, Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino formally rejected the request of the Philippine Overseas Chinese to build a separate market. Prior to this, the so-called "Alien Land Disposal Act" was also promulgated, forcibly seizing coconut plantations, hemp farms, and other agricultural enterprises originally operated by Philippine Overseas Chinese. Fabricating pretexts such as "movement to aid the Chinese Communists and the (Philippine) People's Anti-Japanese Army," five Philippine Overseas Chinese democrats were arrested and deported a few days ago. The Filipino traitor Roxas willingly serves as a lackey of U.S. imperialism, attempting to divert the struggle of the Filipino people.

　　美帝走卒菲奸罗哈斯竟逮捕华侨民主人士
    【新华社陕北十九日电】马尼拉讯：在美蒋全力支持下，菲奸罗哈斯之排华政策已变本加厉。继去年“劳工菲化法案”后，又于最近实施所谓“摊贩菲化法案”，强令接收马尼拉市一千一百八十二座华侨摊贩，上月二十一日马市已有二十四座华侨摊贩被迫迁让，另许多华侨摊贩因拒绝服从该反动法令，横遭宪警逐走。十一日菲副总统兼外长季里诺正式拒绝菲律宾华侨另建市场之请求。在此以前，又曾公布所谓“外侨地产处置法案”，强夺原为菲律宾华侨经营之椰园、麻园等农场企业。并制造“援助中共运动及（菲）人民抗日军”等口实，于日前逮捕并驱逐五名菲律宾华侨民主人士。菲奸罗哈斯甘充美帝走卒，妄图以此转移菲律宾人民的斗争视线。
