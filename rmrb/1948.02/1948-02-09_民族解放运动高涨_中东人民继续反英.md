    National Liberation Movement Surges High
    Middle Eastern People Continue to Oppose Britain
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] Comprehensive news from the Middle East: The anti-British movement of the Iraqi people continues to surge. As soon as the Sadr new cabinet was formed, the people of Baghdad held demonstrations and marches, demanding that the traitor Yaburti, the former Prime Minister who has now fled to Amman, be returned to Iraq for trial by the people. Anti-British movements in other Arab countries are also still spreading. Students in Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, went on strike on the 29th of last month to support the Iraqi people's protest against the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, and to protest against the recent attempt by Bevin and the Egyptian government to resume negotiations to conclude a so-called "alliance treaty." Middle Eastern observers believe that this anti-British movement is "an unprecedented one in Iraqi history. After the students in Baghdad took the lead, it quickly spread throughout the country, and even to all levels of people in the Middle East, forming a huge anti-British wave." The Soviet "News" international commentary also pointed out: "The upsurge of the Arab national liberation movement has forced British colonialists to resort to conspiracies and tricks to deceive the vigilance of the Arab people in order to maintain their rule. However, the Iraqi incident has once again shown how critical the position of British imperialism is in its colonies and dependencies. This shows that the era of Britain claiming to be the master of Arab countries is gone forever."

    民族解放运动高涨
    中东人民继续反英
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合中东讯：伊拉克人民反英运动继续汹涌不已，萨德尔新阁方告组成，巴格达人民即举行示威游行，要求将现已潜逃赴安曼之前总理卖国贼雅布尔提回伊拉克交人民审判。其他阿拉伯国家反英运动亦仍延展中。埃及开罗及亚历山大学生于上月廿九日罢课，声援伊拉克人民抗议英伊条约；并抗议最近贝文与埃及政府间计划恢复谈判，以订立所谓“同盟条约”之企图。中东观察家认为此次反英运动，乃“伊拉克历史上空前的一次。巴格达学生首先发难后迅即延及全国，乃至中东各阶层人民，蔚为巨大反英浪潮”。苏联消息报国际述评亦指出：“阿拉伯民族解放运动之高涨，迫使英国殖民者不得不采取阴谋诡计，蒙蔽阿拉伯人之警觉，以保持其统治。然伊拉克事件已再度表示英帝国主义在殖民地与附属国之地位何等危急。这说明英国自命为阿拉伯国家主人之时代，业已一去不复返了”。
