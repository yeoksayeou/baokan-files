    Mao Zedong
    By A. Strong, translated by Fu Ke
    I.
    In a cave dwelling high in the mountains, above the hot, green valleys shaped by years of labor, lives one of the most advanced thinkers of modern times, Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. The civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan have isolated him from the world; he has lived within a ring of blockade for twenty years. But during this period, he has never been separated from his people. Mao Zedong's ideas have pierced the blockade, inspiring the Chinese revolution.
    Mao Zedong's genius manifests itself vividly in all aspects. It is precisely due to the strategies he formulated that an army surrounded by a technologically superior enemy has been able to establish and develop itself.
    Liu Shaoqi, considered China's most famous Marxist theoretical scholar, told me:
    "Mao Zedong has researched and developed the theory of applying Marxism under Chinese conditions, transforming Marxism into a weapon for 450 million people. Mao Zedong's book, 'On Protracted War,' correctly pointed out the path for the Chinese people to resist the Japanese aggressors, and the 'On New Democracy,' published in 1940, provided an accurate analysis of the path of democratic revolution development under the present conditions. These theories determine the form of national organization in the Chinese democratic areas. Mao Zedong's analysis of the path for the Chinese people to achieve independence, democracy, and prosperity is being studied by communists in India, Japan, and all of Southeast Asia."
    I first met Mao Zedong in August 1946.
    Our car roared along the rocky riverbed of the Yan River, following the stone gate of the mountain ravine that blocked the entrance to the valley. At that time, members of the Central Committee lived inside. The slopes of the loess hills, with many platforms carved out, had been comfortable for the Chinese people living in the northwest for generations.
    Facing a platform with four cave dwellings was the residence of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Mao Zedong—tall, steady, and reserved, with the demeanor of a farmer. His round face, beneath thick black hair, had a broad forehead and deep, thoughtful black eyes that seemed to project deep insight and calm composure. Yet, when he smiled, they sparkled with lively humor.
    He wore a brown cotton uniform, the same worn by three million soldiers of the People's Army and government officials. His manner was harmonious, without any impatience, creating an atmosphere of quiet friendship.
    As we sat under the trees on the flat clay platform, Mao Zedong's beautiful, dark-haired wife prepared to receive us. Mao Zedong's beloved daughter, dressed in bright cotton clothes, played by her father's legs. Sometimes she knelt before her father, received a pat, and then went back to play on the ground.
    Even at the very beginning of our conversation, I noticed someone on the slope of the mountain, about fifty feet above Mao Zedong's cave dwelling, watching us. "Who is that?" I asked, thinking: how easy it would be to throw a bomb onto our platform from above! Didn't Mao Zedong's residence have guards?
    "Those are the neighbor's children," Mao Zedong replied. "They are curious about me hosting a foreign female guest..."
    The children watched from above, but without making a fuss.
    Mao Zedong answered my questions sincerely and very frankly.
    "The Chinese Communists are fighting because Chiang Kai-shek's army came to massacre peaceful residents. And these residents, wanting to live, have to defend themselves," he replied.
    "Will the Communists fight for a long time?"
    "If we could have our way, we wouldn't want to fight for even a day. However, if we must fight, we will fight until there is no need to fight anymore. We have already fought for twenty years; if necessary, we will fight for another twenty years—until complete victory."
    Mao Zedong's conversation, full of vivid imagery and contrasts, was exceptionally precise, lively, and poetic.
    For example, referring to the American weapons seized by the Communists, he called it "America giving blood transfusions to Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek giving blood transfusions to us." And he referred to the counter-revolutionary rulers as "paper tigers" (these paper things are made for Chinese festivals).
    "They have a very fearsome appearance," he said, "but once rained on, they rot into mud."
    Mao Zedong told me that he considered the talk about a US-Soviet war to be a smokescreen created by reactionaries to conceal their true intentions and make capitalist countries submit to US control.
    II.
    Mao Zedong received a broad and diverse education. He studied at Peking University during the eventful years of 1919 and 1920, when students united by the famous "May Fourth" Movement actively fought for Chinese national interests.
    Mao Zedong is a scholar of Chinese classical literature and a profound critic of Chinese opera. To explain a situation, he would naturally and frequently cite from memory. He is an extraordinary poet, but he did not spend much time on poetry.
    Mao Zedong became a Marxist in 1920, when the Russian Revolution awakened advanced Chinese thought. The following year, Mao Zedong attended the first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party; only twenty delegates attended this meeting. During the years when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party formed a united front, Mao Zedong held important positions in both parties. But after Chiang Kai-shek organized a counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Kuomintang offered a reward of 250,000 yuan for Mao Zedong's head.
    Eighteen years ago, when the illegal Chinese Communist Party was divided by internal disagreements, when defeatists believed that the revolution was forever suppressed, and adventurers insisted on immediately occupying large cities, Mao Zedong, in summarizing, proposed the possibility of establishing democratic areas in China. He believed that such areas could be established in the mountains, at the junctions of several provinces. And then this area should become a base for spreading the liberation movement throughout the country. Several such areas were established twenty years ago, and they have now been linked together to form today's vast liberated areas.
    Mao Zedong has never been abroad. He spent twenty years in the inland provinces, and even during these twenty years, for most of the time, he had no postal contact with other places. But Mao Zedong still has a world vision. In a conversation with me at the end of August 1946, he quoted Zhdanov's speech on literary issues. In the cave dwelling with party newspapers and radios, people were recording everything happening in the world day and night.
    To expand his knowledge in all aspects, Mao Zedong often talked with farmers about farming; from these conversations, a "Great Production Movement" was born, which saved the border region from starvation during the blockade. In my conversations with him, Mao Zedong enthusiastically told me about everything in the United States—its political and economic life and its daily conditions—and was interested. If foreign journalists came to him, Mao Zedong would inquire in detail about all the countries they had seen.
    III.
    My last conversation with Mao Zedong was in February 1947, before I left Yan'an.
    At that time, the threat of bombing and advancing troops had forced the evacuation of women, children, and non-combat organizations, and Mao Zedong and the secretaries of the Central Committee (as in the original text - editor) had moved to secluded cave dwellings more than a dozen miles outside the city. But that evening, they came into the city to see the performance of a new play about land reform.
    After the performance, Mao Zedong received me in a vacant cave dwelling that had been uninhabited for a long time. Messengers brought heaters there—for warmth; candles—for light; and the farewell dinner included tea, pumpkin seeds, snacks, and candied peanuts.
    Mao Zedong reminded me that I should fly away on the last American plane.
    "Otherwise," he said, "it might be a year or more before we can send you away."
    No matter how serious the situation was, Mao Zedong and his comrades were very calm and full of confidence in the final victory; in their conversations with me, they talked about the "Great Counter-Offensive" decided to begin in the autumn of 1947.
    The last plane brought me a letter from a friend in New York. The letter was full of anxiety and unease. "Difficult and arduous times await us. Our progressive activists cannot influence American foreign policy for a while. I hope the Chinese Communists have no illusions that the American government can do anything." I told Mao Zedong about the letter, and he smiled. Indeed, he had no illusions. But he believed that the American progressives were too intimidated by the American reactionaries. "American imperialism is powerful," Mao Zedong said, "but at the same time, it is also weak. It is necessary to understand its powerful nature and its weak nature. The American reactionaries bear a heavy burden." He continued with a smile, "He has to support the reactionaries all over the world. If he cannot support them, then the building erected on a shaking pillar will collapse."
    When I talked about the atomic bomb, Mao Zedong said:
    "The production of the atomic bomb is the beginning of the death of American imperialists, because they only rely on bombs. The end will not be bombs eliminating the people, but the people eliminating the bombs."
    Our conversation ended at midnight.
    The next morning, I flew to Peiping, and Mao Zedong moved to a cave dwelling deeper in the mountains.
    In the villages of North China and Manchuria, there is abundant confidence that the people will persevere to victory, that the people's cause, the cause of freedom and a democratic nation, will grow and develop.

    毛泽东
    Ａ·史特朗作  付克译
    一
    在高高的山上的窑洞里，在由于人们长年劳动而变得绿油油的炎热的山谷上，住着一位现代最先进的思想家，中国共产党的领袖毛泽东。国内战争和抗日战争使得他和世界隔绝着，他在封锁圈里过了二十年。但在这一时期内他并没有同自己的人民分开。毛泽东的思想穿过封锁圈鼓舞着中国的革命。
    毛泽东的天才从各方面鲜明地表现了出来。而正是由于他制订出的战略，一个被技术优越的敌人包围着的军队，才能够建立与发展。
    在中国被认为最著名的马克斯主义理论的博学家刘少奇告诉我说：
    “毛泽东研究出在中国条件下运用马克思主义的理论，把马克斯主义变成了四万万五千万人民的武器。毛泽东的‘论持久战’一书，正确地指出了中国人民对日本侵略者反抗的道路，而一九四○年发表的‘新民主主义论’一书中，则对现条件下民主革命发展的道路作了确切的分析。这些理论确定了在中国民主地区的国家组织形式。毛泽东给予中国人民达到独立民主繁荣的道路的分析，为印度、日本和所有东南亚的共产党人所研究着。”
    我同毛泽东第一次相会，是在一九四六年的八月。
    我们的汽车沿多石的延河的河床鸣叫着，顺着山沟的石头大门挡住了到沟里去的入口。当时里边住着中央委员会的委员们。开凿了很多平台的黄土山岗的山坡，几世来对于居住在西北地方的中国人是舒适安逸的。
    面向着一个平台的四孔窑洞，便是中国共产党的领袖毛泽东的住宅。
    毛泽东——高高的身材，为人稳重谨严，有农民的风度。他的圆圆的脸上，在丛密的黑发下面是宽宽的额头和深思的黑眼睛，似乎透射出深谋远虑和镇定安详，然而当他微笑时，便发出活泼幽默的光亮。
    他穿着褐色棉布制服，三百万的人民军的战士和政府职员都是穿着这样的制服的。他的举止是和谐的，没有一点急燥，使人感到安静的友情的气氛。
    我们坐在平坦的黏土平台的树下时，美丽的，黑发的毛泽东的妻子准备招待我们了。毛泽东的爱女穿着鲜亮的棉布衣，在爸爸的腿边玩着，有时她两膝跪在爸爸面前，得到抚摸之后，便又走到地上去。
    还是在我们谈话刚开始时，我发现在山岗的斜坡上，在毛泽东的窑洞上边五十英尺左右的地方，有人在瞧我们。“那里是谁？”我问，我想：从上边向我们的平台扔炸弹是多么容易呢！难道毛泽东的住宅没有哨兵在守卫着吗？
    “这是邻家的孩子们，”毛泽东回答。“他们为我这儿招待一位外国女客而感到新奇呢……”
    孩子们在上边注视着，但没有吵嚷。
    毛泽东诚恳地，非常坦直地回答着我的问题。
    “中国共产党人进行斗争，是因为蒋介石的军队来屠杀和平居民。而这些居民们因为想活命，便得自卫。”他答。
    “共产党人是不是要长久的作战下去呢？”
    “事情如果由我们作主，那我们本来是一天也不愿意打的。然而如果我们非打不成时，我们将要打到不需要打时为止。我们已经打了二十年了；假如需要，我们将再打他二十年——直到完全胜利。”
    毛泽东的富有鲜明形象和对比的谈话，是异常确切的，同时特别活泼生动而富于诗意。
    例如，提及关于共产党人夺取的美国武器时，他称之为“美国人给蒋介石输血和蒋介石给我们输血”。而对反革命的统治者们，他则称之为“纸老虎”（这些纸糊的东西是为了过中国的节日所制的）。
    “他们有一幅非常可怕的样子，”他说：“可是给雨水一淋，他们就烂成泥了。”
    毛泽东告诉我：关于美苏战争的说法，他认为是反动分子们制造的烟幕，好掩盖他们真实的企图，使资本主义国家都服从于美国的控制。
  二
    毛泽东受过广泛的多方面的教育。他在北京大学学习时，正是为事变所丰富的一九一九和一九二○年的年代，那时为有名的“五四”运动所团结起来的大学生们，积极地为中国民族利益而战斗着。
    毛泽东——中国古典文学的博学家，中国歌剧艺术的深刻的评论家。为了解释一种情况，他自然地多次地引证了记忆里的东西。他是非凡的诗人，但他在诗文上并未花去许多时间。
    毛泽东在一九二○年就成为马克斯主义者了，那时的俄国革命唤起了先进的中国思想。第二年毛泽东参加了中国共产党第一次代表大会；出席这个会的只有二十个代表。当国共两党结成统一战线的年代中，毛泽东在两党中均占着重要的位置。可是当蒋介石组织反革命叛变之后，国民党便以二十五万元的赏格来征求毛泽东的头。
    十八年前，当不合法的中国共产党因党内意见不同而分歧时，当失败主义者们认为革命是永远被镇压下去了，而冒险主义们却坚持立刻占领大城市时，毛泽东于总结时提出了在中国建立民主地区的可能性。他认为这种地区可以建立在山里，建立在几个省份的交界地带。而然后这地区就应成为在全国传播解放运动的根据地，在二十年前就建立了数个这样的地区，现已联结成今天广大的解放区了。
    毛泽东一次也没有出过国。他在内地各省渡过了二十年，甚至在这二十年中，大部分时间同其他地方连邮政的联系都没有。但毛泽东仍然具有世界的眼光。一九四六年八月底在和我的谈话中，他引证了日丹诺夫关于文学问题的讲演中的话。在放着党报和电台的窑洞里，人们不分昼夜地在记录着世界上所发生的一切事情。
    为了在各方面扩大自己的知识，毛泽东经常和农民们谈论农事；从这些谈话中，产生了一个“大生产运动”，这运动在被封锁期间，挽救了边区而免于饥饿。在同我的谈话中，毛泽东兴致勃勃地，对我告诉他关于美国的一切事情——美国的政治经济生活及其日常状况，都感到兴趣。如果外国记者到他那儿，毛泽东便详细地询问他关于所有看见过的国家。
  三
    最后一次我同毛泽东的谈话，在一九四七年的二月，是我要离开延安之前。
    那时轰炸和进兵的威胁，已迫使在疏散妇女、孩子和非战斗机关，而毛泽东和中央委员会的书记（原文如此——编者）们，搬到离城十几里以外荫蔽的窑洞里去了。但是这天晚上，为了看土地改革的新剧的上演，他们进城来了。
    演完后毛泽东在一个久无人住的空窑洞里接待了我。通讯员把暖炉带到那里——为了取暖；蜡烛——为了取光；送别的晚餐上预备了茶、南瓜子、点心和粘糖的花生米。
    毛泽东提醒我，应该乘最后的美国飞机飞走。
    “不然”他说：“可能得过一年或者更久之后，我们才能把你送走。”
    不管情况多严重，毛泽东和他的战友们非常镇静和充满着最后胜利的信心；在同我的谈话中他们谈到了决定于一九四七年秋天开始的“大反攻”。
    上一次的飞机给我带来了我一个纽约朋友的信。信是充满惊恐不安的信。“艰难困苦的时间在等待着我们。我们进步的活动家们一时是不能给予美国对外政策以影响的。我希望中国共产党人没有任何幻想，认为美国政府能作什么事情。”我把信告诉给毛泽东，他微笑了一下。真的，他没有任何的幻想。但他认为美国的进步分子，太过份地为美国反动分子所恐吓住了。“美帝国主义是强大的”毛泽东说，“但同时他也是虚弱的。需要了解其强大的性质和其虚弱的性质。美国反动分子担负着艰难的重荷。”他微笑着继续说：“他得援助全世界的反动分子。如果他不能支持他们，那么架在一根动摇的柱子上的建筑物，便会倒塌的。”
    当我谈到原子炸弹时，毛泽东说：
    “原子炸弹的产生就是美帝国主义分子死亡的开始，因为他们依靠的只是炸弹。结局却不是炸弹消灭人民，而是人民消灭炸弹的。”
    我们的谈话结束时，已经是半夜了。
    第二天早晨我便飞到了北平，而毛泽东搬到更深的山中的窑洞里去了。
    在华北和满洲的乡村中，充溢着安定的信心，相信人民要坚持到胜利，相信人民的事业，自由和民主的民族的事业，将要成长和发展。
