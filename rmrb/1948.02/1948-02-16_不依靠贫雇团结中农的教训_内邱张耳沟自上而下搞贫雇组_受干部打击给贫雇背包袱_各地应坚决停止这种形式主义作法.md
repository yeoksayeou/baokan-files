[Taihang News] Bad cadres such as the village chief of Zhang Ergou Village in the Third District of Neiqiu used various means to threaten, bully, and suppress hired and poor peasants, forcing them to urgently request withdrawal from the poor and hired peasant groups. Since the promulgation of the Land Law, the leadership has emphasized that "poor and hired peasants should be in power," and the district organized a poor and hired peasant group in the village in isolation. From then on, village chief Liang Niu Zi (a bankrupt landlord who still hires long-term laborers) and Wu Weihui Director and Public Security Officer Li Bao Fu (who still hires long-term laborers) were very dissatisfied and deliberately played with "hired and poor peasants in power" everywhere to threaten and suppress poor and hired peasants. Whenever there was work in the village, they forced it onto the poor and hired peasant group. For example, this time the county issued four types of winter production statistical forms, and the Wu Weihui director insisted that the poor and hired peasant group be responsible for them. The poor peasant Li Lao Jin said: "You have given all of these to us, but we are all from backgrounds of carrying long-term labor and herding cattle and sheep. How can we do this?!" The Wu Weihui director said: "I knew you couldn't take power, not even fill out a form or classify your class status; who told you to spend other people's loans?!" This made the seven poor and hired peasant households in the poor and hired peasant group burdened and worried all day long. They reflected that the district's organization of the poor and hired peasant group had harmed them. When the masses in the village had any problems, they went to the cadres, who shirked responsibility, saying: "Now that the poor and hired peasants are in charge, what dare the cadres say? Go find them!" However, when Li Hao Shan of the poor and hired peasant group wanted to go to his sister's house, the village chief refused to issue a road pass. This constantly made the poor and hired peasants feel aggrieved and worried them. They complained: "Joining the group has caused trouble. In the past, we suffered from hunger and hardship, but that was still a natural misfortune." In addition, the village chief also used old clan threats at the poor and hired peasant meeting, saying: "From now on, you will be in charge! If you have a big opinion of me, I won't be able to be a cadre, and you will have to be governed by Liu Jia Zhuang (Liu Jia Zhuang and Zhang Er Gou used to be an administrative village, but because Liu Jia Zhuang village was large, the large village suppressed the small village, and the masses of Zhang Er Gou were afraid of being bullied in the past); if you have a smaller opinion of me, we several cadres can still serve, and people from this village are always closer to people from this village." This frightened the poor and hired peasants even more. Recently, Comrades Wang Shou Xin and Ning Zhi Jian from the county construction section came to the village to inspect work. When they visited the hired and poor peasants, the hired and poor peasants responded perfunctorily: "Life is not bad! Now we can all turn ourselves around!" When Wang and others suggested that the hired and poor peasants should take power and lead the land reform in the future, Li Hao Shan, a sixty-two-year-old bachelor hired peasant, said: "I have food and drink, no matter what, don't let me join the poor and hired peasant group." At this time, he burst into tears, asking to be expelled from the poor and hired peasant group immediately. The other six hired and poor peasant households also pleaded to withdraw from the group. When Comrade Shou Xin visited Li Er Gou's family, a hired peasant who had not yet turned himself around, Er Gou said at first: "In the past, when district cadres came, they all went to the cadres' homes, but now they only come to my house. After you leave, the village cadres don't know how they will bully me!" After in-depth and patient interviews, the above-mentioned criminal acts of the village cadres threatening and bullying the hired and poor peasants were discovered. Finally, Er Gou repeatedly instructed Comrade Wang: "Be sure not to tell the village chief, if he knows, I won't be able to eat well after you leave!" Comrades Shou Xin and Zhi Jian continued to investigate hardships and found that among the seven hired and poor peasants in the poor and hired peasant group, three had been subjected to unreasonable struggles last year. Li Hao Shan was forced by the cadres to divide his seven persimmon trees and "forcefully exchange" them for two acres of land; Li Cai Xiao, a long-term laborer, increased the wages of the landlord Bu Shi He by three dou of wheat, but the cadres forcibly carried away two dou; Er Gou's wife often quarreled with him because she thought he was wasteful, and the cadres falsely accused her of disrupting production, brought her to a general meeting to be struggled against, and the child cried when he saw his mother being detained, and the child was also locked in a confinement room. After Wang and Ning discovered these problems, they resolutely stated that "we must support everyone (hired and poor peasants) and be the masters," and at the same time, they deeply mobilized the hired and poor peasants, preparing to remove this stone slab.

    不依靠贫雇团结中农的教训
    内邱张耳沟自上而下搞贫雇组
    受干部打击给贫雇背包袱
    各地应坚决停止这种形式主义作法
    【太行消息】内邱三区张耳沟村长等坏干部，使用种种手段威胁、欺侮、压制雇贫，迫使雇贫迫切要求退出贫雇小组。自公布土地法后，领导上强调提出“贫雇要当权领导”，区上并到该村孤立的组织了一个贫雇小组。从此村长梁牛子（破落地主，现在还雇长工）、武委会主任兼公安员李保福（还雇着长工）非常不满，处处拿“雇贫当权”来故意玩弄、威胁、压制贫雇。村里有啥工作都硬往雇贫小组身上推，比如这次县里发下四种冬季生产统计表，武委会主任拿着硬叫贫雇小组负责弄。贫雇李老金说：“你们都给了俺，俺都是些扛长工、放牛羊出身，怎能弄了这个？！”武委会主任就说：“知道你们就掌不了权，连个表也不会填，阶层也不会划；谁叫你们花人家贷款哩？！”闹得贫雇小组的七户贫雇背了大包袱，整天发愁，反映区里组织贫雇小组是害了他们。村里群众有啥问题去找干部，他们一退六二五的说：“现在贫雇当家作主，干部敢说啥？去找人家吧！”但是贫雇小组的李好山要到他姐姐家时，村长却不给开路条。这样整天逼得贫雇受气，可愁坏啦，他们埋怨说：“参加了组，可惹下祸啦，以前挨饿受罪吧，也还是受个自然罪。”另外，村长还在贫雇会上利用旧时的宗派威胁说：“从今以后，就叫你们作主哇！你们要对俺意见大了，俺的干部当不上，你们就得归人家刘家庄管（刘家庄和张耳沟在过去是一个行政村，因刘家庄村大，大村压小村，旧时把张耳沟群众欺侮怕了）；要对俺意见小些，我们这几个干部还可当，本村人总是亲本村人”。这一说，更把贫雇吓唬住了。最近县建设科王守信、宁志坚两同志到该村检查工作，找雇贫访时光，雇贫应付说：“生活不赖！现在都可翻转身啦！”王等提出贫雇当权将来领导土地改革时，六十二岁的老雇贫光棍李好山说：“我有吃有喝，你们不管怎也不要叫俺参加贫雇组啦”。这时他大哭起来，要求马上开除他出贫雇组。其他六户雇贫也纷纷恳求退组。守信同志到现在还没翻透身的雇贫李二苟家访问时，开头二苟说：“以前区干部来了都到干部家，现在来了光到俺家，你们走了，人家村干部不知怎么欺侮俺哩！”经过深入耐心访问，才发现村干部上述威胁、欺侮雇贫的罪恶行为。最后，二苟再三吩咐王同志说：“当紧不要向村长说，让人家知道了，你们走后，俺可是吃不倒呀！”守信、志坚两同志继续访苦，又发现贫雇小组里的七户雇贫，就有三户在去年挨过无理的斗争；李好山是让干部强分了他七棵柿树，“硬换”给他二亩地；李才小住长工，向地主卜石河增加了三斗麦的工资，干部硬给扛走二斗；二苟家老婆，因嫌二苟浪费常常吵架，干部诬说是她捣乱生产，把二苟老婆弄到大会上斗了一顿，孩子见扣起他娘就大哭起来，把孩子也关到禁闭房。王、宁二同志发现上面这些问题后，一面坚决表明“一定要给大家（雇贫）撑腰作主”，一面深入发动雇贫，准备揭掉这块石板。
