Title: Unified Mutual Aid Dividend: Poor and Hired Laborers Suffer Great Losses; Taihang Discovers Formalism in Winter Production

Taihang News: In many villages in the Third Special District and counties like Wuxiang, winter production has not started from the actual needs of hired and poor laborers. Satisfied with subjective desires and formalistic practices, hired and poor laborers have suffered great losses and are dissatisfied and unmotivated. Summarizing the situation, there are three scenarios: The first is the unified mutual aid and unified dividend distribution for various sideline productions. In Qingcaoao, Third District of Pingshun, winter production is under the unified leadership of the land cooperative (an organization similar to agricultural production teams from last year) for sideline shares (excluding women). Accounts are settled once every three months, and dividends are distributed based on each household's invested capital and labor, with an 80/20 split between labor and capital. The leadership believes this method is excellent, but hired laborer Shi Qizhi said: "The money earned from transportation, oil mills, charcoal burning, and weaving is all handed over to the sideline share. It takes three months to receive dividends, making it difficult for the poor to survive!" Ten hired and poor households in the village are currently lacking food. Some want to do more transportation but lack travel expenses (all travel expenses are self-provided). Borrowing from the credit cooperative requires daily interest. Conversely, the earned freight cannot cover the cost. As a result, only those with travel expenses can do more transportation and receive more dividends. The hired and poor laborers' assessment of this old method is: "Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst; it only benefits the wealthy!" Cadres in Qiaoshang Village, Sixth District of Huguan, insisted on combining transportation, shop-keeping, and wartime support, subjectively prescribing a unified dividend distribution based on the amount of work done. In reality, sideline production is complex, and production methods and profits vary. Taking transportation as an example, the items transported differ, and the earnings also vary. Unified dividend distribution based on work points resulted in some suffering losses and others benefiting. Hired laborer Li Qiaocheng earned an average of 222 yuan per half-day by transporting medicine and bringing back vinegar. Middle peasant Li Bingwu earned an average of only 94 yuan per half-day by transporting medicine and bringing back corn. With unified dividend distribution per half-day, averaging 149 yuan, Bingwu received 54 yuan more than Qiaocheng, while Qiaocheng received 73 yuan less. After calculating the accounts and distributing the dividends, Qiaocheng became unmotivated in transportation. In addition, the transportation team earned 144 yuan per half-day, while the shop earned only 44 yuan per half-day. With unified dividend distribution, averaging 81 yuan per half-day, the transportation team suffered a great loss and became demoralized. Hired laborer Li Hehua, who owns a shop, used to earn one or two thousand yuan a day. However, the cadres emphasized work exchange and combination, forcing unification. Now Hehua cannot receive as much money, and demands the cancellation of the combined dividend distribution. Worse still, some village cadres decided to prioritize profitable production like saltpeter boiling for hired and poor laborers, but then implemented combination with transportation and other activities, and unified dividend distribution, thus taking away the extra money earned by the hired and poor laborers. This foolish practice is most dissatisfying to the hired and poor laborers.

The second scenario involves extracting bonus money from the mutual aid production dividends. Many villages in Lucheng, Huguan, and Licheng counties forcibly extract one-tenth (such as Qiaoshang in Huguan) or four percent (Shanghuang in Lucheng) of the dividends to reward so-called "activists." The masses disagree with this practice of rewarding a few individuals with the money earned by everyone. Especially since the so-called activists are often leaders of mutual aid organizations, or people close to the leadership, and these people are mostly from the middle peasant class or above. Therefore, the hired and poor laborers who lack food, clothing, and capital are even more dissatisfied with this practice. In addition, the Henghe Zhai Manxi iron smelting group in the Fourth District of Changzhi, in order to "consolidate" work exchange, decided to extract one-tenth of the dividends as a fixed fund, preparing to engage in other sideline occupations in the future. This only suits the tastes of wealthy households, and the hired and poor peasants who have not yet turned themselves around and are currently struggling with their lives disagree. They demand: "Use the earned money to fill the gaps," or immediately use it all as capital for reproduction.

The third scenario involves unfair work exchange methods in women's spinning and weaving mutual aid. Macun Village, Third District of Wuxiang, is a village with a foundation in spinning and weaving, but hired and poor women are not very enthusiastic about winter spinning. At a meeting of hired and poor women, everyone unanimously reflected: "Our skills are poor, and most of us don't know how to weave. Exchanging work with women who know how to weave requires spinning half a catty of cotton for every catty of cloth woven. In reality, they can weave two catties of cloth a day, while we can only spin a little more than five taels of cotton a day, taking three days to repay their one day of work. Suffering such a great loss, how can we be motivated to participate in mutual aid?" The labor accounting in Dongzhuang, Seventh District of Qinyang, is also unfairly stipulated: spinning one tael of thread is only equivalent to one work point, and only four taels can be spun in a day, while weaving one bolt of cloth (taking two days) is equivalent to fourteen work points. A spinner loses one and a half work points when exchanging for one bolt of cloth. This situation is very unreasonable, and hired and poor women demand a change in this practice.

    统一互助分红  贫雇吃了大亏
    太行发现冬季生产中的形式主义
    【太行消息】三专区和武乡等县不少村庄的冬季生产，因领导上未从雇贫的实际要求出发，满足于主观愿望形式主义的一套做法，雇贫吃亏很大，都不满意不起劲。综合起来，有三种情形：头一种是各种各样的副业生产统一互助，统一分红。平顺三区青草凹的冬季生产，是土地合作社（去年农业生产时候的一种组织）里的副业股统一领导（妇女不在内），三个月才算一次帐，按各家所入资金及劳力，劳八资二分红。领导上对这种办法，认为很好，可是，雇贫史其枝却说：“运输、油坊、烧炭、编造赚下的钱，都交到副业股，等三个月才能分红，当下穷苦人就困难的不能过活呀！”该村当下就有十户雇贫没吃的；有的打算多去运输却没盘费（盘费都是自备），到信用社借吧，借一天有一天利；反过来，赚下的脚价可不能顶用。结果，只好叫有盘费的人去多运输多分红。雇贫们给这种旧办法的评价是：“远水解不了近渴，光叫人家有法户喝吧！”壶关六区桥上村干部，硬要实行运输开店战勤三大结合，主观订了按活计工统一分红等一套办法。实际上，副业生产复杂，生产门路和利润都不一样；就运输来说，担的东西不同，赚钱多少也不同，统一按工分红，就有的吃了亏，有的占了便宜。雇贫李巧成走时担碗药石，回来捎醋，每晌平均赚二百二十二元；中农李丙午，走时也担碗药石，回来捎玉茭，每晌平均只赚九十四元；按晌统一分红，平均每晌分一百四十九元，丙午每晌就多分巧成五十四元，巧在每晌少分七十三元，经过算帐分红后，巧成运输不积极啦。另外，运输队每晌赚洋一百四十四元，在家开店每晌只赚洋四十四元，统一分红，每晌平均分红八十一元，运输队吃了大亏，也都干的泄了气。雇贫李何花自己开的一座店房，以前一天能赚一两千，可是干部强调变工结合，硬统一起来，现在何花就分不上那么多钱，要求取消结合分红。更糟的是有些村庄的干部，也决定尽先让贫雇搞熬硝等赚利大的生产，可是又实行和运输等结合，统一分红，又把雇贫多赚的钱分走了。这种哄傻子的做法，雇贫最不满意。第二种是从互助生产红利中抽奖励金。潞城、壶关、黎城等县不少村庄，硬抽十分之一（如壶关桥上）或百分之四（潞城上黄）的红利，去奖励什么“积极分子”，群众是不同意这种把大家赚来的钱奖了少数人的做法的。尤其因为所谓积极分子往往是互助组织的领导者，或与领导上接近的人，而这些人大都是中农以上阶层，所以没吃、没穿、没本钱的雇贫，更不满意这种做法。另外，长治四区横河翟满喜铁炉组，更为了“巩固”变工，决定抽出十分之一的红利作不动基金，准备将来搞其他副业；这只是适合富裕户的口味，而没翻身的、当前生活就很困难的雇贫农是不同意的，他们要求：“赚下钱补窟窿”，或马上都作为再生产的本钱。第三种是妇女纺织互助中，纺和织的变工办法不公道；武乡三区马村是纺织有基础的村庄，但雇贫妇女冬纺劲头不大。在雇贫妇女检查会上，大家一致反映：“咱技术差，多数人不会织布。和人家会织布的妇女变工，规定是织一斤布纺半斤花，实际上，人家一天能织二斤布，咱一天最多纺五两多花，三天才能还完人家一个工。象吃这大亏，还能互助的有劲？”沁阳七区东庄纺织计工也规定的不公道：纺一两线才顶一分工，一天只能纺四两，而织一匹布（用两天）就顶十四分工；纺妇换织一匹布就亏工一个半；这种情况很不合理，雇贫妇女要求改变这种作法。
