    Jinnan Our Army Counter-Attacks to Seize Grain
    Nearly a Company of Chiang Kai-shek Bandits from Anyang Annihilated
    [Jinnan News] A portion of the 117th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek’s 40th Division, in coordination with the entirety of the puppet Wang Ziquan and Guo Qing forces, a portion of Cheng Daozeng’s forces, and the security regiments of Cheng'an, Ci, and Lin counties, accompanied by more than 200 carts, crossed the Zhang River north before dawn on the 1st of this month to seize grain in the Jiangwucheng, Hongshan, and Wuben areas on the border of Ci and Lin counties. Upon hearing the news, our Jinnan 9th Military Sub-district's "Hunan" and "Hubei" troops advanced rapidly westward for more than 40 li to intercept the enemy. After repelling their guarding troops along the way, a unit of our "Hunan" troops pursued the enemy to Bantang Village, north of Xindianji, where they intercepted the 2nd Battalion of the puppet Wang Ziquan forces and dealt them a heavy blow, annihilating the majority of their 6th Company. The remaining enemy fled westward in disarray. In total, 8 enemies were killed, over 20 were wounded, and 30 were captured alive. The spoils of war included 3 Type 79 light machine guns, 29 Type 79 rifles, 1 Mauser pistol, 1,518 rounds of ammunition, 15 Type 82 mortar shells, 10 grenades, more than 10 li of field telephone wire, and a portion of other military supplies. Furthermore, over 30 carts, 24 head of cattle, and a large quantity of other grain, cotton, clothing, quilts, pigs, sheep, and farm implements seized by the enemy were recovered and immediately returned to the local masses.
