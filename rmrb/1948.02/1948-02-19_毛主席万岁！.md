    "Long Live Chairman Mao!"
    In the areas around Yan'an where guerrillas were active, walls, doors, and stone pillars were covered with various slogans such as "Eliminate Hu Zongnan" and "Down with Chiang Kai-shek," but the largest and most prominent were the five characters "Long Live Chairman Mao." One dark night, the guerrilla propaganda team sneaked into a village that was a stronghold of Chiang's bandits, scattered red and green leaflets on the road, pasted the Land Law Outline on the doors, and wrote "Long Live Chairman Mao" in imitation Song typeface on a smooth wall. The next morning, the masses quietly spread the word, "Our guerrillas came back last night and wrote slogans on the walls!" When the enemy Ba長 (head of the Pao-Chia system) found out, he rushed to report to the company headquarters. The company commander said fiercely, "That's impossible, I'm sure even the ghost of a guerrilla wouldn't dare to come in." Before he finished speaking, the sentry ran in to report, and took out many red and green slogans. The company commander ordered the Ba長: "Quickly send someone to erase the slogans." The common people who were sent used iron shovels to scrape off the ink marks stroke by stroke, and the more they scraped, the deeper it became, and the five characters "Long Live Chairman Mao" looked like they were carved in. The company commander cursed, and ordered the soldiers to scrape off the character "Mao" and write the character "Chiang." But the next day the character "Chiang" was gone, and it was still "Long Live Chairman Mao." This was changed back and forth for several days, and the enemy was terrified, so they had to add sentries and specially assign sentries to guard that slogan. On this very night, not long after the changing of the guard, three people came from outside the village, one carrying a basket and a brush, one carrying a rolling pin, and the leader carrying a lantern and calling out "Ma Wazi, come home!" Two people responded, "Coming home!" The enemy sentry hurriedly asked, "What are you doing?" The one carrying the lantern answered loudly, "Going to the Lord's Temple to call my child's soul back." The three people walked into the village like this, and when they reached the slogan, the one carrying the rolling pin first knocked down the sentry, the one carrying the lantern stabbed the sentry with a knife, the one carrying the brush wiped off the character "Chiang", took out brush and ink from the basket, wrote the character "Mao", put the red and green leaflets on the road, and the three people walked out of the village again calling out. The next morning, the whole village was in an uproar, and everyone looked at the five shining characters "Long Live Chairman Mao!" with surprised eyes!

    “毛主席万岁！”
    在延安周围游击队活动的地方，墙上门上石牌柱子上都写满了“消灭胡宗南”“打倒蒋介石”等各样标语，但是最大而显著的是“毛主席万岁”五个大字。一天黑夜游击队标语组摸进了蒋匪某据点村子，将红绿传单散在路上，土地法大纲贴在门上，在一堵又光又平的墙上用仿宋体写了“毛主席万岁”。第二天一早群众都悄悄的传开了“咱游击队昨黑夜回来了，墙上还写下标语啦”。敌保长知道后急忙跑到连部报告，连长气凶凶地说：“活见鬼，我保险游击队的魂也不敢进来”。话未说完，哨兵也跑来报告，并掏出许多红绿标语。连长命令保长：“赶快派人把标语擦掉”。被派的老百姓就用铁铲依笔划铲掉墨迹这样越铲越深越显，“毛主席万岁”五个大字倒象是刻的了。连长大骂了一通，并命令士兵刮去“毛”字，写上“蒋”字。但第二天“蒋”字不见了，照旧是“毛主席万岁”。这样改来换去连续了几天，敌人胆寒了，不得不加岗放哨并特别派哨兵专门守在那条标语跟前。就在这一天夜里，刚换哨不久，从村外来了三个人，一个拿箩子刷子，一个拿着杆面杖，领头的提着灯笼边走边叫“马娃子回来”！两个合应“回来了！”敌哨兵忙问：“干什么的”？提灯笼的高声答道：“到老爷庙给我娃叫魂去”。三人就这样走进了村，走到那条标语跟前，提杆杖的首先扑倒了哨兵，提灯笼的照准哨兵就是一刀，拿刷子的把“蒋”字刷掉，从箩里取出笔墨写了个“毛”字，把红绿传单放在路上，三个人又边叫边应的走出了村子。第二天一早便轰动了全村，大家用惊喜的眼光望着那五个放光的大字“毛主席万岁”！
