Viewing the Price Fluctuations in the Chiang Area: Chiang Kai-shek's Economy Heads Towards Total Collapse

　　The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in order to extract the blood and sweat of the people, frantically printed money. By the end of last year, the total amount of Chiang currency issued into the market had exceeded 100 trillion yuan. The new banknotes issued this year are worth 100,000 yuan each. The more banknotes printed, the less they are worth, and prices keep rising. In addition, the Chiang bandits are constantly being hit by the iron fists of our People's Liberation Army. Large areas of villages in Northeast China, North China, and Central China have become liberated areas, using our Jinnan currency, Beihai currency… and no longer using Chiang Kai-shek's currency. These Chiang Kai-shek currencies from these places all flow into the Chiang-controlled areas. With a smaller Chiang-controlled area, the currency seems even more abundant. The bandit gang members, seeing that Chiang Kai-shek is failing and nearing his end, also take advantage of the situation, fish in troubled waters, and engage in speculative trading. As a result, things become even more expensive, and the people in the Chiang area are suffering immensely. For example, in Yuci, near Taiyuan in Yan Xishan's territory, a half-tael (approximately 18.5 grams) sesame cake now sells for 5,000 yuan. It will definitely rise further. According to newspapers in Tianjin in the Chiang-controlled area, the prices in Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang area, were 180,000 times higher at the end of last year than before the Anti-Japanese War. It rose fifteen times within the last year, which is the highest in the world after World War II.

　　From February last year to February this year, prices in the Chiang area have increased sharply seven times:

　　The first time was in February last year, taking rice as an example, the price per dan (approximately 50 kg) rose to 60,000 yuan. The second time was from early April to early June, rising to 220,000 yuan. The third time was from late June to mid-July, rising to 500,000 yuan. The fourth time was from mid-August to the end of October, rising to 900,000 yuan. The fifth time was from mid-November to the end of December, rising to 1.2 million yuan. The sixth time was from January 2nd this year, rising to 1.5 million yuan. The seventh time was from February 2nd, when rice sold for 1.55 million yuan per dan.

　　By February 5th, the price rose to 1.66 million yuan per dan. On the 6th, it was 1.8 million yuan per dan. On the 16th, it soared again to 2.1 million yuan per dan.

　　From these trends of price increases, the following points can be seen: The first time it took a month to stop rising slightly, the second time it took two months, the third time it stopped after a month because the Chiang bandits used "economic secret agents" to brutally suppress it, while the fourth time it took two months to stop rising slightly; the fifth time it took a month and a half to stop rising slightly; the distance between the sixth and seventh times was very short, almost always rising, and has not stopped yet.

　　The time of slight stability between each two price increases is getting shorter and shorter. The interval between the first and second times was one month, between the second and third times was three weeks, between the third and fourth times was one month, between the fourth and fifth times was two weeks, and between the fifth and sixth times was only one week. The interval between the sixth and seventh times was only a few days. According to Shanghai financial observers: "When this distance is shortened to two weeks to one week, the banknotes will continue to fall, and prices will continue to rise, until it leads to a complete economic collapse." Judging from the current trend, it has reached such a point.

　　As the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty heads towards a major military, political, and economic collapse, it will inevitably more frantically exploit the working people and small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, which will inevitably further concentrate the hatred of the broad masses of people, who will rise up and accelerate the final crushing of the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary dynasty in coordination with the People's Liberation Army.

### 从蒋区物价波动看蒋介石经济走上大崩溃

　　从蒋区物价波动看蒋介石经济走上大崩溃
    蒋介石匪帮为了搜刮人民的血汗，拼命的印票子；截至去年年底，蒋币发到市面上的总数目已经有一百万亿元以上。今年出的新票子，一张就是十万元；票子印得越多越不值钱，物价就涨个不停。再加上蒋匪到处挨咱人民解放军的铁拳，关东、华北、华中大片大片的乡村都成了解放区，用的都是咱冀南票、北海票……，不用蒋介石的票子了，这些地方的蒋介石票子都流到蒋管区去。蒋管区地方小了，票子也就显得更多了。匪帮人员看到蒋介石快不行了，离死不远了，就也趁火打劫，混水摸鱼，大做投机买卖。这样，东西就更贵了，蒋区老百姓都苦得没法。象太原旁边榆次阎锡山的地方，眼下一两半重的烧饼就卖五千元。以后一定还是要涨，据蒋管区天津的报上说，蒋区经济中心上海去年年底的物价比抗日战争前高了十八万倍，去年一年之内就涨了十五倍，在第二次世界大战后是世界上最高的。
    从去年二月到今年二月，蒋区物价就大涨了七次：
    第一次是在去年二月，拿大米作例子，每担涨到六万元。第二次是四月初至六月初，涨到二十二万元。第三次是六月下旬至七月中旬，涨到五十万元。第四次是八月中到十月末，涨到九十万元。第五次是从十一月中到十二月底，涨到一百二十万元。第六次自今年一月二日起，涨到一百五十万元。第七次是二月二日起，米每担卖一百五十五万元。
    到二月五日，每担涨到一百六十六万元。六日每担一百八十万元。十六日，就又暴涨到每担二百一十万元。
    从这些涨风的趋势中，可以看出来下面这几点：第一次是涨了一个月才稍停，第二次涨了两个月，第三次因为蒋匪用“经济特务”横暴镇压涨了一个月就停住了，而第四次又是涨了两个月才稍停；第五次涨了一个半月才稍停；第六、七次之间矩离很短，几乎是一直涨，至今还没有停。
    每两次上涨中间稍稳定的时间是越来越短了，第一次与第二次中间为一个月，第二次与第三次间为三个星期，第三次与第四次间为一个月，第四次与第五次间为两星期，第五次与第六次间仅为一星期。第六次与第七次中间仅数天。据上海金融界观察家说：“这距离缩短到两星期至一星期的时候，钞票就要不断下跌，物价就要不断上涨，直到促成整个的经济崩溃。”就现在的趋势看，已经到了这样的时候了。
    当蒋介石王朝军事、政治、经济走上大崩溃的这时候，也必然更疯狂的压榨劳动人民和中小工商业者，而这也必然更集中起广大人民的仇恨，起来加紧配合人民解放军最后打碎蒋介石反革命王朝。
