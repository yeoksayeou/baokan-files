　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th—According to disclosures from various sources, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities are now preparing to auction off mining, industrial, and transportation sovereignty in South and Southwest China, in order to further turn these two regions into colonies of American imperialism. On the 13th of this month, Gu Yuzhu, deputy secretary-general of the Chiang Kai-shek National Economic Commission, admitted that Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun had ordered that "all conveniences be given to foreign (American) businessmen in China," and that the commission had been ordered to invite relevant departments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to draft "new regulations" to "welcome" foreign (American) private capital. These regulations will allow foreign (American) capital to directly invest in establishing factories and companies in China. At the end of December of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek Economic Department drafted a geological survey and exploration plan for mines in Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, Taiwan, and the Xisha Islands. In the middle of last month, Sun Yueqi, deputy director of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee, went to Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to inspect mining and industrial enterprises. On the 27th of last month, Weng Wenhao, director of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee, and Song Ziwen, chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Province, issued a joint statement stating that they would fully develop Guangdong's electricity, coal mines, sugar industry, and Hainan Island's iron ore, which have been designated as investment targets for American imperialism. Hu Shanheng, director of the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction, also went to Changsha on the 27th of last month to discuss "Hunan-Guangdong economic cooperation issues" with the Chiang Kai-shek Hunan authorities. The Chiang Kai-shek Jiangxi Provincial Government announced a "Jiangxi Industrialization" plan on the 29th of last month, listing the hemp textile factory, dyeing textile factory, hemp embroidery factory, oil pressing factory, sugar factory, tea factory, sawmill, cement factory, and machine-made brick and tile factory belonging to the province's state-owned Xingye Company as American investment targets. On the 28th of last month, He Guoguang, deputy director of the Chiang Kai-shek Chongqing Headquarters, announced a "Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan Border Development Plan," deciding to establish a "Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan Border Affairs Committee" to be responsible for the investigation and development of industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and transportation in the area. This area is the Daliang Mountains region, which the American military had already conducted detailed surveys for the purpose of military and economic aggression against China. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are planning to use the method of developing "business relations" with Tibet to assist American economic forces in invading Tibet. It is reported that the Tibetan business delegation that arrived in Nanjing at the end of last month to discuss "business" issues with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was the result of American and Chiang Kai-shek exerting pressure on Tibet.
