Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. Comrade Zhou Ning of a directly subordinate unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army recently invented a "propaganda bullet," which has been successfully tested and for which he has received a meritorious service award. This propaganda bullet can project leaflets, books, newspapers, and letters to the enemy from a distance, and can also be used to contact our friendly neighboring units. As long as the safety pin in the artillery shell is not pulled out, the contents inside can be taken out after it lands at its destination. During an experiment in a certain place, three shells were fired in succession, and colored pieces of paper were seen flying in the sky on the opposite side, which did not fall to the ground for about twenty minutes.

    东北我军某部发明宣传弹
    【新华社东北九日电】东北解放军直属队某部周宁同志，近创造“宣传弹”，试验成功，得到记功嘉奖。这种宣传弹可从远距离向敌方投射传单、书报和信件，也可和我友邻部队联络。只要炮弹中的保险针不抽出，等它落到目的地后，就可拿出里面装的东西。在某地举行实验时连发三炮，只见对面上空彩色的纸片飞舞，约二十分钟才落到地上。
