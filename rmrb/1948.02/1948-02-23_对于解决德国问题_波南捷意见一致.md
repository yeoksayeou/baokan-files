　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Prague Dispatch: The foreign ministers' meeting of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, after convening on the 17th and 18th, has concluded and issued a communique. It stated that "The foreign ministers of the three countries have reached complete agreement on issues related to the solution of the German question." The communique continued, "The governments of the three countries believe that the political division of Western Germany endangers the foundation of European peace. They are deeply concerned that the predetermined plan to eliminate German militarism has not been implemented in the Western occupied territories. The monopoly trusts and concerns in that region have not been liquidated, and an increasing number of Nazis are being appointed to important positions, which will lead to dangerous consequences. The governments of the three countries believe it is necessary to reiterate the following just principle: countries that have suffered from German aggression should have priority in economic reconstruction. The governments of the three countries demand that Germany meet their legitimate demands for reparations, which should be consistent with the degree of improvement in German production levels, which shall not exceed the limits stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement. The governments of the three countries demand the implementation of the United Nations' decisions on punishing war criminals, and the governments of the three countries urge the world to pay attention to the intolerable tolerance shown in the Western occupied territories towards organizations aimed at revenge." The communique concluded by strongly stating that the principle that issues directly related to Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia must be consulted with those countries must be adhered to.

　　对于解决德国问题
  　波南捷意见一致
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】布拉格讯：捷、波、南三国外长会议经十七、十八两日集会后，业已闭幕；并发表公报，首称："三国外长对有关解决德国问题的意见完全一致。"继称："三国政府均认为：西部德国的政治分裂，危害了欧洲和平的基础，并对前定清除德国军国主义的计划迄未在西部诸占领区付诸实施一节，深感焦虑，该区的垄断托辣斯与康采恩一直没有清算，纳粹分子被任要职者越来越多，这将招致危险的后果。三国政府认为有必要重申下列正义原则，即：遭受德国侵略的国家应有经济重建的优先权，三国政府要求德国满足三国的正当赔偿要求，赔偿应与德生产水平提高的程度相一致，此项水平不得超过波茨顿协定所规定的限度。三国政府要求实行联合国通过的关于惩罚战犯的决定，三国政府又促请世人注意西部诸占领区对以复仇为宗旨的组织所表现的不能容忍的宽容。公报结语力称：凡与捷、波、南三国有直接关系的问题，必须与各该国家协商，这一原则必须遵守。
