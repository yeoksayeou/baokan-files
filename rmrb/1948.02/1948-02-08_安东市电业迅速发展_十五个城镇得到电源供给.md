Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 5th. The power industry in Andong City has developed rapidly. Since the city was liberated again last autumn, the power industry employees have overcome material difficulties and worked hard to restore operations. As of now, two transformer substations, Liudaogou and Dabao, have been added, with a total of eleven extra-high voltage transformers, with a total capacity of 9,700 kilowatts. (When the Chiang bandits occupied the city, it could only supply 4,000 kilowatts.) The power supply range has also been expanded, allowing the surrounding fifteen towns, including Dabao, Changshan, Saima, Xinkailing, and Lianshanguan, to receive power. 9,040 meters of new distribution lines were built, 2,100 li were repaired, and more than 2,100 li of transmission lines were inspected. Mass production has received electricity supply. The added power in Andong City is 4,320 horsepower, of which more than 3,000 horsepower is used by major factories. The city's electric heating has increased by 556 kilowatts, electric lights have increased by 4,088, and an additional 5,497 streetlights have been installed. The warm and bright Andong stands in stark contrast to cities like Shenyang, which are endangered by the Chiang bandits.

    安东市电业迅速发展
    十五个城镇得到电源供给
    【新华社辽东五日电】安东市电业发展迅速。该市从去秋重获解放以来，电业员工克服器材困难，努力恢复，截至目前已增设六道沟与大堡变压所两处，共增设了特高压器十一台，总容电量为九千七百基罗。（蒋匪侵踞时，该市仅能供电四千基罗。）送电范围也扩大了，使周围大堡、长山、赛马、新开岭、连山关等十五城镇都得到了电源供给。新建配电线路九千零四十米，修补达二千一百里，检查送电线路二千一百多里。群众生产都获得了电力供给，安东市区增设的动力就有四千三百二十匹马力，其中三千多匹马力为各大工厂所用。市区电热增加五百五十六基罗，电灯增加四千零八十八盏，另增设路灯五千四百九十七盏。温暖、光明的安东，与蒋匪危城沈阳等地恰成对比。
