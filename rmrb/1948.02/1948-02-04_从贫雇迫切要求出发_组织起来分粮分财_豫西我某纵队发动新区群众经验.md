    Starting from the Urgent Demands of the Poor and Hired Laborers
    Organize to Distribute Grain and Wealth
    Experiences of Our XX Column in Western Henan in Mobilizing the Masses in New Areas
    [Our Newspaper's News] Our Field Army's XX Column, fighting and moving in western Henan, mobilized the masses while engaging in combat. From the highest leaders to the cooks and animal tenders, everyone actively participated. By the end of last October, according to incomplete statistics, three brigades and four units directly under the column had mobilized more than 27,000 people in 149 villages and one county town, distributing over 310,000 jin of grain, more than 3,000 mu of land, and a large amount of ill-gotten wealth. Agricultural associations were established in 21 villages, and poor peasant groups were established in 26 villages. Model figures such as Li Zonglin and Tian Peiqin emerged in mobilizing the masses, greatly strengthening the relationship between the army and the people. This quickly raised the class consciousness of the masses in the new areas, who voluntarily acted as guides for the People's Liberation Army, organized stretcher teams, and transported ammunition. This situation, in turn, greatly encouraged and educated the troops, making the commanders and fighters more confident, more consciously abide by mass discipline, more courageous in combat, and more active in mobilizing the masses. This is a major political victory, equal in significance to military victory.
    In mobilizing the masses, the column has two approaches: one is to find poor and hired peasants and start from their urgent demands. If the poor and hired peasants lack food and clothing and demand grain and clothes, then encourage and lead them to distribute grain and ill-gotten wealth. As a result, the situation can be quickly broken through, and a mass movement can be formed. The other approach is to emphasize deliberation and then organize struggle. As a result, the breakthrough is slower or does not occur. According to the summary of the column's political work conference, the former approach is more adapted to the conditions of the new area. In the beginning, the masses can be directly led to distribute grain and ill-gotten wealth, but they cannot be led all the time; otherwise, it would be paternalism. The general process should be from not daring to do it themselves to doing it themselves, from night to day, from secret to public. If the masses dare to come forward from the beginning, the troops do not need to come forward to lead. The summary also pointed out: It is inevitable that the masses will be somewhat chaotic when they start doing things themselves. Don't be afraid of this, because the demands of the masses are extremely urgent. Don't be afraid of the chaos of the masses; being afraid of chaos will restrict the masses. The chaos of the masses doing it themselves is a step forward compared to us coming forward. If unfairness arises because of chaos, it will lead to their demand to organize. The combination of action, education, and organization, and continuous action, will gradually improve the movement and make it more in-depth. The process of continuous action is the process of the peasants raising their class consciousness. Some troops pursue numbers and use simple methods, resulting in administrative orders and formalism. These must be corrected and prevented.
    The column's political work conference also made the following specific provisions: A. All officers and soldiers of the army have the responsibility to mobilize the masses. B. Each company and platoon should select five liberated soldiers to form a liberated group, led by the branch's mass movement committee member. The battalion does not have a special organization, but is directly led by the instructor. The regiment and brigade set up mass work teams, and a mass movement work committee is established under the regimental and brigade committees, with the director, political commissar, or deputy political commissar serving as secretary. C. Mainly relying on the training corps, more than 300 cadres will be transferred to ignite the spark in appropriate locations. D. The discipline of mass mobilization workers: 1. It is not allowed to eat the landlord's things or be lured by the landlord's interests. 2. It is not allowed to embezzle, destroy, or buy the fruits of struggle. 3. It is not allowed to molest women. 4. Keep the secrets of the masses.

    从贫雇迫切要求出发
    组织起来分粮分财
    豫西我某纵队发动新区群众经验
    【本报消息】我转战在豫西的野战某纵队，一面作战，一面发动群众，上自首长、下至炊事员、饲养员莫不积极参加，至去年十月底止，据不完全统计：三个旅及纵直四个单位，已在一百四十九个村和一座县城中发动了两万七千多群众，分了三十一万斤粮食，三千多亩地和大批浮财。建立了二十一村的农会，二十六个村的贫农小组。并出现了李宗林、田培勤等发动群众的模范，大大密切了军民关系，使新区群众迅速提高阶级觉悟，自动为解放军担任向导，组织担架，运送弹药，这一情形又反过来给部队一个极大的鼓舞和教育，使指战员信心更高，更加自觉的遵守群众纪律，作战更加英勇，发动群众也更加积极，这是重大的政治上的胜利，与军事胜利有同等的意义。
    在发动群众中，该纵队有两种作法：一种是找贫雇农，从贫雇农的迫切要求出发。贫雇没吃没穿，要求粮食和衣服，那么就鼓励和带领他们去分粮分浮财，结果很快就能突破局面，形成群众运动，另一种是强调酝酿，再组织斗争。结果就突破得慢，或突不破，据纵队政工会议的总结，前一种作法比较适应新区的情况，开始时可以直接带领着群众去分粮分浮财，但不能一直带领下去，否则就是包办代替。一般的进程应是由不敢自己动手到自己动手，由黑夜到白天、由秘密到公开，如群众开始就敢出头，部队人员便不用出头带领。总结中又指出：群众自己动手开始难免有些乱，这不用怕，因为群众的要求异常急迫，不要怕群众乱，怕乱就会限制群众。群众自己动手的乱，比我们出头是前进了一步。如果因为乱而产生了不公平，就会引起他们组织起来的要求。行动与教育、组织相结合，连续行动，会逐渐提高，使运动深入。继续行动的过程，就是农民提高阶级觉悟的过程。有些部队追求数字，方式简单，发生行政命令，形式主义的毛病，必须纠正防止。
    该纵队政工会议又作了以下几项具体规定：甲、全军干部、战士均有发动群众的责任，乙、每连、排选翻身战士五人，组成翻身小组，由支部民运委员领导，营不专设组织，由教导员直接领导，团、旅设群众工作队，并在团委、旅委下成立民运工作委员会，以主任、政委或副政委任书记；丙、以教导队为主，抽调三百以上干部，派赴适当地点点火；丁、发动群众工作者的纪律：一、不准吃地主东西、受地主利诱；二、不准贪污、破坏或收买斗争果实；三、不准调戏妇女；四、替群众保守秘密。
