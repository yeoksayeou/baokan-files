Comrade Li Qi of the Fifth Prefectural Committee Sends a Letter
    Li Qi
    I am sending ten copies of the cadre self-examination materials from the Party rectification meeting, and will send more successively for your research and adoption. In addition, we are starting to organize materials from several peasant cadres who have reflected on their historical experience, which can show their development process.
    Recently, the role of the newspaper has been strengthened compared to before. To give just one example, after the newspaper exposed the shortcomings of judicial work in Wu'an, judicial sections in many counties in our sub-region began to clear cases and release innocent people; and the judicial department has always been a "cold corner." The "Peasant Voices" column is extremely popular among the cadres attending meetings. This is a very necessary practice to promote democracy and transform the newspaper into one of the masses. It is also hoped that the "Suggestions and Criticisms" column will be given more space, even if the articles are shorter, so that more people can speak.
    At the end of the Party rectification meeting, we plan to solicit everyone's opinions on the newspaper.

    Li Qi, February 16th

Comrade Li Qi's combination of Party rectification meetings to strengthen Party newspaper construction, organize the use of Party newspapers, and prepare to solicit everyone's opinions at the meeting are all very necessary practices, and are provided for reference by various regions.

　　五地委李琦同志来信
    李琦 
    寄去整党会议中，干部反省材料拾份，以后当陆续寄去，供你们研究采用。此外，我们正着手整理几个从历史上反省的农民干部的材料，可以看出其发展过程。
    最近，报纸的作用较前加强。只举一个例子，报上揭发了武安司法工作的缺点后，我分区不少县的司法科开始清理案件，释放无罪者；而司法部门历来是个“冷角”。农民呼声栏，从开会的干部来看，受到极大的欢迎。这是发扬民主，变报纸为群众的很必要的一个作法。建议与批评栏，亦望加多篇幅，无妨短些，使更多的人可以说话。
    整党会议结束时，拟征求一下大家对报纸的意见。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　李琦、二月十六日
    李琦同志结合整党会议加强党报建设，组织运用党报并准备在会中征求大家意见，这些做法都非常必要，特提供各地参考。
