　　Liberating Anshan and Faku, We Annihilated Two Enemy Reorganized Divisions
　　Northeast Winter Offensive's Fifth Great Victory
    [New China News Agency Northeast Front Urgent Telegram, 21st] On the evening of the 19th, the People's Liberation Army annihilated two enemy reorganized divisions and recovered the cities of Anshan and Faku. The number of prisoners is currently being verified. Our army launched the general offensive against Anshan at 7:25 AM on the 19th. After approximately sixteen hours of fierce fighting, by 24:00 on the 19th, we completely annihilated the defending enemy, the 25th Division of the 52nd Army and a portion of the public security police, without a single one escaping. We recovered Anshan, the famous "Steel Capital" of the Far East. The enemy's Provisional 62nd Division of the New 6th Army, besieged in the isolated city of Faku, attempted to break through to the south on the 15th without success. On the afternoon of the 17th at 5:00 PM, they attempted another breakthrough to the northeast. We immediately intercepted and pursued them. After two days and three nights of fierce pursuit and annihilation, we finally captured and annihilated the entire enemy force between Faku and Changtu at 21:00 on the 19th. The city of Faku was then recovered by us. With this, our army has achieved five great victories in the winter offensive, annihilating seven enemy reorganized divisions and liberating the 12th and 13th cities on the periphery of Shenyang. The enemy's 25th Division was completely annihilated northwest of Kuandian in November of the year before last. This is the reorganization and re-annihilation of that division. Furthermore, the enemy's Provisional 62nd Division was formed after our autumn offensive last year by combining the special service regiment of the former Chiang bandit Northeast Headquarters, one regiment of the 169th Division of the New 6th Army, and security regiments, and was fully equipped with American weaponry.
    [New China News Agency, Northeast, 20th] Recently, a reporter interviewed Cao Jimin, deputy commander of the Chiang bandit Provisional 54th Division, who was recently captured in the Liaoyang campaign, in a certain area on the front lines. He is a native of Fengcheng, Andong, is fifty years old this year, and graduated from the seventh class of the Northeast Jiangwutang Military Academy. After the September 18th Incident, he worked for the "East Hebei Autonomous Government" of the traitor Yin Rugeng. After Japan surrendered, he returned to Andong to organize the "underground army" for the Kuomintang. When talking about the current living conditions inside the Chiang bandit forces, he said: "The soldiers haven't been paid for two months, and they can't even get enough sorghum rice to eat. Most of the soldiers in our division are from Andong. When they see that the situation is not good, who is willing to die for nothing? We are now afraid of your army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) just like the Qing soldiers at the end of the Qing Dynasty were afraid of the revolutionaries. Everyone gets a headache when they hear about fighting." When the reporter asked for his opinion on the current situation in the Northeast, he said: "Our side (referring to the Chiang bandit side) is like having third-stage tuberculosis, relying entirely on injecting air and bragging to maintain its life. Everyone knows that it can't last long!"

　　解放鞍山法库我歼匪整两师
  　东北冬季攻势第五次大捷
    【新华社东北前线廿一日急电】解放军十九日晚歼敌两个整师，收复鞍山、法库两城，俘获正清查中。我军系于十九日晨七时二十五分起，发起对鞍山之总攻。经十六小时许激战，至十九日二十四时，在市区内全歼守敌五十二军二十五师及交警一部，无一漏网，收复远东著名的“钢都”鞍山城。被围于法库孤城之敌新六军暂六十二师，于十五日向南突围不逞后，十七日下午五时再度向东北突围，我当即堵击尾追，经两日三夜之猛烈追歼，最后于十九日二十一时，在法库、昌图间将该敌全部捕歼，法库城当为我收复。至此，我军冬季攻势已五次大捷，歼敌七个整师，解放了沈阳外围的第十二、十三座城市。按敌二十五师前年十一月曾被全歼于宽甸西北，此为补充后重歼。又敌暂六十二师系去年我秋季攻势后，由前蒋匪东北行营之特务团、新六军一六九师一个团及保安团合编而成，全部美械装备。
    【新华社东北二十日电】日前记者在前线某地访问刚从辽阳战役中被俘的蒋匪暂五十四师副师长曹济民。他是安东凤城人，今年五十岁，东北讲武堂第七期毕业，“九一八”事变后即在汉奸殷汝耕的“冀东自治政府”工作，日本投降后，回到安东替国民党组织“地下军”。谈到目前蒋匪内部的生活状况，他说：“当兵的已经两个月没发饷了，高粱米也吃不饱，我们师的士兵多半是安东人，一看形势不好，谁还肯白白送死呢？我们现在怕贵军（指解放军）就象满清末年的清兵害怕革命党一样，大家一提起打仗就头痛”。记者问他对东北目前形势的看法，他说：“我们那里（指蒋匪）就象害第三期的肺病一样，全靠打空气针吹牛皮来维持寿命，这是谁也知道维持不久的！”
