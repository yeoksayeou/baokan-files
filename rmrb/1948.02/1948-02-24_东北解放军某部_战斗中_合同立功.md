Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th. In a certain offensive battle north of Shenyang, the explosion team and the machine gun team of the 1st and 10th companies of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army implemented a "contract for meritorious service," which had a significant impact. When the 10th company was dispatched, it pre-selected an explosion team as the main force to complete the breakthrough mission. After deliberation, inspiration, and mobilization, the team formulated a plan for meritorious service, determined to undertake the explosion task. After the team's enthusiasm was ignited, it was mobilized to select a machine gun team to provide fire cover. After discussion, the first group of the machine gun squad of the first platoon and the third group of the machine gun squad of the second platoon were selected, and then small artillery, ladder, and rescue teams were selected. After the instructor mobilized the machine gun team, the explosion team and the machine gun team were organized to jointly study the coordinated actions to complete the task, announced the plan for meritorious service, expressed their determination, guaranteed each other, and seized the time for joint exercises, which made them more closely prepared in terms of ideology and action. Finally, the explosion task was completed in the struggle. After the evaluation of meritorious service, the explosion team and the machine gun team were awarded major and minor merits respectively. The situation of the contract for meritorious service between the explosion team and the machine gun team of the 1st company was roughly the same. The contract team members of the two companies all believed that this method of contracting for meritorious service had a serious plan, a particularly strong determination, and a comparison between each other, and their enthusiasm was also high. The unit's research believes that contracting for meritorious service has the following advantages: First, there is a center. Based on the current specific task (such as attacking a fortified position), the central group (such as the explosion team) promotes other groups (such as the machine gun team) to jointly establish meritorious service. Second, the plan for meritorious service is very specific, and it can achieve the effect of mutual cooperation, mutual guarantee, and mutual responsibility. Third, it can give full play to collective strength, and various units and personnel can be formed into a strict combat whole, so that everyone can exert their strength and strive to complete the common task. Now the unit is improving and promoting this method.
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has been practicing plains warfare tactics in the outskirts of Shenyang for days. Before the exercise, cadres above the company level were convened for specific research, and points that should be paid attention to in plains operations were put forward. Cadres at all levels were also formed into companies, and they were assigned to be squad, platoon, and company commanders. After hypothetical situations and detailed discussions, the exercise was held. All cadres were serious and responsible, as if they were in a real battle. After the cadres returned to their original units, they immediately created a wave of exercises. Now, after repeated research and exercises, all units have greatly increased their confidence in future large-scale operations.

　　东北解放军某部
  　战斗中“合同立功”
    【新华社东北十九日电】解放军某部一、十两连在沈北某次攻坚战中，爆破组与机枪组实行合同立功，作用很大。十连出动时，预先选择一个爆破组作为完成突破任务时的主要力量，经过酝酿、启发、动员该组订立功计划，下决心要求担任爆破任务。当该组情绪掀起后，即发动其自行挑选担任火力掩护的机枪组。经过讨论，挑选了一排机枪班的第一组与第二排机枪班的第三组，进而又挑选了小炮、梯子、救护等组。指导员向机枪组进行动员后，即把爆破组与机枪组组织起来，共同研究完成任务的协同动作，宣布立功计划，表示决心，互相保证，并抓紧时间进行联合演习，在思想上和行动上都有了较密严的准备。终于在斗争中完成了爆破任务，经评功结果，爆破组和机枪组分别立了大、小功。一连爆破组，机枪组合同立功的情形亦大致相同。该两个连合同组员对这一合同立功的方式，都认为订计划认真，决心特别大，互相之间有比较，情绪也高。该部经研究认为合同立功有以下优点：一、有中心，根据当前的具体任务（如攻坚），以中心组（如爆破组）推动其他组（如机枪组）共同立功。二、立功计划非常具体，并能收互相配合，互相保证，互相负责之效。三、能发挥集体力量，可把各种单位，各种人员组成一个严密的战斗整体，使大家都能发挥力量，为完成共同任务而努力，现该部正提高与推广此种方式。
    【新华社东北二十日电】解放军某部连日于沈阳外围演习平原战术。演习以前，曾召开连以上干部进行具体研究，提出平原作战应注意各点，又将各级干部组成连队，由他自己分任班、排、连长，经假设情况，再经详细讨论，就举行演习。各级干部都认真负责，如入战斗实境。各干部回归各原单位后立即造成演习热潮。现各部经过迭次研究演习后，对于今后更大规模的作战均倍增信心。
