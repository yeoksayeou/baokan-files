Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, 26th: Late news: In the first half of January, local armed forces in the Second and Sixth Military Sub-districts of Yu, Anhui, and Jiangsu eliminated over 900 local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek soldiers during mopping-up operations. The details are as follows: (1) From January 6th to 14th, the local armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district engaged in five battles with bandit units led by Zhou Xiangzhen, Chen Tao, Sun Hongliang, and others in the territories of Taihe, Hao County, Huaiyang, and Luyi Counties, capturing 350 bandits alive and seizing 4 light and heavy machine guns and 104 rifles and pistols. (2) A unit of the Sixth Military Sub-district's local armed forces mopped up local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in Mengcheng, Woyang, and Gaoyang Counties. From January 7th to 15th, they won all four battles, killing over 60 bandits, capturing 498 alive, including Ma Congwu, the pseudo-Fifth District Chief of Fuyang, and seizing 314 rifles and 13 warhorses. They destroyed 2 pseudo-district offices and 8 pseudo-township offices.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 25th: The 356th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek bandits, which was annihilated in the fourth battle to capture Lankao, had a significant shortage of personnel, with only about 70 soldiers in each company. Most of them were new recruits conscripted from Kaifeng, Heze, and other places, and many were old, weak, or disabled. A reporter met four newly captured soldiers on the Lankao front, one of whom was a fool, and another was blind in his left eye. When attacking Lankao Railway Station, twelve new soldiers were found wearing military caps but still dressed in civilian clothes in the cave dwellings. Some of the new recruits only knew how to eject bullets, and some did not even recognize ordinary weapons. Xia Kaiyi, a farmer conscripted from Kaocheng, had been a soldier in the regiment for four months but still called anti-tank guns "big guns." When the regiment entered Lankao on the 16th, Liu Ruzhen, the commander of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division, told his officers and soldiers: "Our task is to defend the city on the one hand and train for a month on the other," but they were annihilated in just three days.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Liaodong Front commended people's heroes during the Spring Festival. The unit's leaders sent a large number of letters to the heroes to congratulate them on the New Year. Various units held banquets to celebrate the heroes and organized symposiums for everyone to learn from their combat experience. The army newspaper prominently published the annual achievements of each hero squad, platoon, and company: one company annihilated a total of 1,515 enemies in one year, seizing 39 various cannons and 62 light and heavy machine guns. Another company trained 7 company-level cadres, 9 platoon-level cadres, and 54 squad leaders and deputy squad leaders throughout the year. During the Spring Festival, heroes from various units announced their plans to eliminate the enemy in 1948, and countless liberation fighters also expressed their determination to strive to earn the "Mao Zedong Medal" this year.
