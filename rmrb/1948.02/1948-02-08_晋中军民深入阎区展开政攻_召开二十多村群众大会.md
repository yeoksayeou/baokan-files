Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th. The military and civilians in the Jinzhong plains are launching a broad, mass-based political offensive towards the heartland controlled by the Yan bandits. On the night of January 6th, over 300 military personnel and civilians from the Yangqu and Jiaocheng border areas entered the vicinity of a key stronghold of the Yan bandits via multiple routes, convening mass meetings in over twenty villages. They publicized the counter-offensive situation of our army, boosted the people's confidence in victory, and left a warning for the Yan bandit "shock troops" (landlord armed forces): "If you continue to do bad things, we will resolutely suppress you." Several days later, seven soldiers escaped from strongholds such as Matoushui, while the "shock troops" bandits were terrified. On the 19th, the Qing(yuan)-Tai(yuan) work team suddenly entered villages surrounding a key stronghold of the Yan bandits in Qingyuan, distributed propaganda materials, liberated more than 40 women who had been forced to "confess and be reborn," and killed Yue Tongsu, the captain of the "Revenge Brigade" in Beiying. The masses in the Pingchuan area were extremely excited.

    晋中军民深入阎区展开政攻
    召开二十多村群众大会
    【新华社晋绥五日电】晋中平川军民向阎匪心脏区展开广泛的群众性的政治攻势。一月六日夜，阳曲、交城边缘地区军民三百余人，分路进入阎匪某重要据点周围，召开二十余村的群众大会，宣传我军反攻形势，提高人民胜利信心，并留话警告阎匪“突击队”（地主武装）：“如再作坏事，就坚决镇压”。几天之后，马头水等据点逃出士兵七人，“突击队”匪徒则恐慌万状。十九日清（源）太（原）武工队突入清源阎匪重要据点周围村庄散发宣传品，解放被迫“自白转生”的四十多个妇女，并击毙北营“复仇大队”队长岳同苏。平川群众极为兴奋。
