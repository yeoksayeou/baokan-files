Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th—Shanghai News: The so-called "Sino-American Commercial Arbitration Association" through which the bandit Chiang Kai-shek is forfeiting China's judicial sovereignty to his American masters, will soon be established. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have already formed the so-called "China Commercial Arbitration Association," and convened its inaugural meeting in Shanghai on the 21st. Representatives from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's economic, foreign affairs, and social departments, as well as the US Commercial Counselor in China and the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, all attended. The association's general headquarters will be located in Shanghai, with branches established in various provinces and cities directly under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The association's task is to "assist the American Arbitration Association in establishing a joint arbitration association." The "Sino-American Commercial Arbitration Association," originally named the "Sino-American Commercial Arbitration Committee," was proposed by the American imperialists in October 1945, and demanded that it serve as a judicial agency to handle American commercial disputes in China, with its decisions having legal effect. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits immediately agreed to amend existing laws for this purpose. On December 5, 1945, the American imperialists convened a "Sino-American Commercial Arbitration Conference" in New York, to which the Chiang Kai-shek bandits sent six representatives. The conference lasted for more than a month, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were instructed to organize an "Arbitration Association." The preparatory committee of this association was established in Shanghai on March 3, 1946.

　　蒋出卖中国司法主权
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】上海消息：蒋匪断送中国司法主权予其美国主子的所谓“中美商务公断会”，不久即将成立。蒋匪已组成所谓“中国商务公断协会”，于二十一日在沪召开成立大会，蒋匪经济、外交、社会三部代表及美帝驻华商务参赞、上海美商会会长皆出席。该会总会决定设沪，并于各省及蒋匪直辖市设立分会。该会任务即为“协助美国公断会，成立联合公断会”。按“中美商务公断会”原名“中美商务仲裁委员会”，系美帝于一九四五年十月所提出，并要求以之作为处理美国在华商务纠纷之司法代理机构，并使其决定具有法律效力。蒋匪当即答应为此修改原有法律。四五年十二月五日美帝在纽约召开“中美商务公断会议”，蒋匪派代表六人参加，会议历时月余，蒋匪当受命组织“公断协会”，四六年三月三日该会筹备会即在沪成立。
