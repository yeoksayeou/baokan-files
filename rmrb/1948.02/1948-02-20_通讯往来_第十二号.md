    "Writing biographies for poor and lower-middle peasants" is a good way for self-education and raising class consciousness. Why should we rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to unite with the middle peasants? This can be fully answered from the suffering experienced by the poor and lower-middle peasants themselves, and from their simple revolutionary views on land reform. During our visits to poor and lower-middle peasants, we should record the history of those who have worked hard for many years and are upright, and write down their opinions on land reform. The vast number of readers are welcoming such reports.

    “给贫雇农作传”是自我教育和提高阶级教育的一个好办法。我们为什么要依靠贫雇农团结中农？这从贫雇农亲身经受的痛苦，从他们对土地改革的一些朴素的革命观点中可以充分的得到回答。我们大家在访贫雇中应该替那些长年劳动的、为人正派的贫雇农写下他们的历史，写出他们对土地改革的意见。广大读者都在欢迎着这样的报导。
