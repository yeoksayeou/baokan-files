Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Batavia Dispatch: Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands on the 17th of last month and the establishment of the Hatta compromise cabinet, the Dutch aggressors have even more frantically launched military offensives and carried out large-scale burning and killings in various cities of Java. According to reports from the Indonesian News Agency: Dutch troops continue to attack Indonesian military positions, with particularly fierce fighting taking place in areas such as Karawang in West Java and Malang in East Java. Since the Indonesian army withdrew from the Van Mook Line, more than 30 cases of Dutch atrocities have occurred in Java and Sumatra. On January 26th, Dutch troops massacred 285 Indonesian residents in two towns in West Java, including women and children, and burned down 136 houses. In addition, in Batavia, Surabaya, and Samarenda in Celebes, the Dutch invaders imprisoned 6,000 Indonesian people, and on the 14th, nine Indonesian patriots were murdered. The Dutch imperialists' plot to use terror tactics in a vain attempt to suppress the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement has now aroused extreme indignation among the Indonesian people; and they are "determined to resist the invading forces" (TASS, 12th). On the 12th, the Indonesian Youth Federation in Batavia sent a letter to the Three-Nation Mediation Committee, protesting the Dutch occupying authorities' imposition of martial law in Batavia, demanding severe punishment for the perpetrators of the massacres in West Java and other places, and abolishing the Madura puppet election and secessionist movement.
