　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Belgrade dispatch: The sixth issue of the "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," a publication of the Information Bureau of the Nine European Communist Parties, was published here on the 3rd. This issue contains a communique stating that the meeting of the Information Bureau of the Nine Communist Parties held in Yugoslavia in mid-January agreed that the temporary editorial committee established in the past to publish the materials of the Nine Communist Parties' meetings has completed its task, and decided to establish a permanent editorial committee composed of representatives of the Nine Communist Parties. Yudin, editor of the Soviet Labor Newspaper and vice-chairman of the International Association of Journalists, serves as the editor-in-chief. The editorial committee includes ten people, including Biro, Buican, Weidacher-Pisaka, Jengis, Gorsitz, Grigorenko, and Sigtel. This issue contains a special article by Marinin denouncing the Marshall Plan, stating that American reactionaries have never relied on their fifth column in Europe (from neo-fascists De Gaulle and Gasperi to Blum, Saragat, Edley, and Bevin) to do evil as they do now. The reason is that the Marshall Plan has encountered resistance at home and abroad and is clearly facing difficulties. This issue also contains an article entitled "Conspiracy," refuting the claim that "the German Communist Party is supporting strikes and slowdowns in the western occupation zones," denouncing it as "the most stupid lie of the American and British diplomatic intelligence agents and the Schumacher faction."

    欧洲九国共产党情报局决定成立常驻编委会
    【新华社陕北六日电】贝尔格莱德讯：欧洲九国共产党情报局刊物“争取持久和平与人民民主”第六期，已于三日在此间出版。本期载有公报称：一月中旬在南斯拉夫召开的九国共产党情报局会议，同意过去为出版九国共产党会议资料而成立的临时编委会，已完成了它的任务，并决定成立九国共产党代表参加的常驻编委会。由苏联劳动报编辑与国际记者协会副主席尤丁任主编，编委会中包括比罗、布伊康、魏达——彼萨、詹吉斯、哥尔西茨、格里高连、西捷尔等十人。本期载有马里宁痛斥马歇尔计划之专文称：美国反动派从未象现在这样依恃其在欧洲的第五纵队（从新法西斯分子戴高乐、加斯贝利到勃鲁姆、萨拉盖特、艾德里和贝文）来为非作歹。其原因是由于马歇尔计划已遭到国内外的反抗，显然已面临难关。本期并载有“阴谋”一文，驳斥“德共在西部占区扶植罢工怠工骚动”之说，斥之为“美英外交情报员和舒马赫派最愚笨的谎言”。
