Weekly Comprehensive War Report for February 12th to 18th:

　　Since the Spring Festival, on various fronts in the north and south, the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the people's local armed forces, has been actively clearing and suppressing Chiang bandits and local bullies, recovering towns and cities, and achieving repeated victories. The Jinan People's Liberation Army recaptured the strategic point of Yuncheng and Jiexian city for the second time on the 7th. The Chiang bandit 30th Division, which defended Yuncheng, abandoned the city and fled under the siege of our army and people. The railway between Lingshi and Linfen on the Tongpu Railway is still under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The Yan bandit 66th Division, which sneaked into the isolated city of Linfen, is panic-stricken under the attacks and encirclement of our local armed forces and militiamen. After the great victory in Liaoyang, the Northeast People's Liberation Army continued to carry out sweeping operations around Shenyang. In the past ten days (February 7th to 16th), in Shahebao in southern Shenyang, Shifosi in northern Shenyang, and Masanjiazi in western Shenyang, a total of more than 4,900 enemies were annihilated, including units of the 52nd Army, New 6th Army, New 1st Army, and New 3rd Army, and more than ten strongholds and stations such as Shahebao and Xinglongdian were captured. The Eyuwan Jianghan Military Region pursued and suppressed the local Chiang bandits entrenched in Mianyang. From the 5th to the 10th, they recaptured Mianyang city and successively captured strongholds such as Pengjiachang, Shahu, Daijiachang, Fengkou, and Maojiachang, annihilating two security corps and three township offices. The local armed forces of the Eyu Military Region also completely annihilated a company of the Guangshan Security Regiment at Fujiadian, north of Guangshan, on the 5th. The people's local armed forces in western Anhui have completely destroyed enemy strongholds, bunkers, and highways between Shucheng and Tongcheng in recent days, and have collected all the electric wires. On the 8th, they also annihilated a company of the Anqing Security Regiment northwest of Anqing. In January, our army in Eyuwan carried out a total of 190 large and small battles, annihilating more than 14,900 Chiang bandits, including 1,126 regular soldiers. More than 30 important towns such as Dengxian, Xixian, Suixian, Qianjiang, and Xinzhou and Changxuanling were captured. The local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district of Yushan'e captured Daying, northwest of Baofeng, on the 8th, killing and capturing more than 200 enemies. The local armed forces of the Third Sub-district routed more than 700 bandits and diehards near Luanchuan, killing and capturing more than 50. The local armed forces of Songxian, in coordination with farmers from 15 villages, suppressed the armed rebellion of reactionary landlords, and seized more than 180 guns hidden by the landlords, and organized hundreds of militiamen. A unit of our main force in the Sixth Sub-district of Yuwansu attacked the enemy at Xiejiaqiao in eastern Fuyang on the 8th, annihilating more than 120 enemies. On the 12th, another unit of our army shot down an enemy plane near Qixian, and the fuselage was destroyed. In the Jiaodong area, the local armed forces outside Yantai took the initiative to attack the enemy and crack down on grain-grabbing bandits and puppets in January, fighting 66 battles, killing and wounding 470 enemies, capturing 120 alive, and killing, wounding, and capturing 164 "Homecoming Legions." Our army also surrounded the enemy occupying Longkou from the east, south, and west. The Northwest People's Liberation Army has achieved great results in its winter training.

　　During the Lunar New Year, the people in the newly liberated areas of Xuchang, Baofeng, Yexian and other places on the southern front celebrated the first Lunar New Year after liberation. The masses universally and enthusiastically launched a movement to support the army. The People's Liberation Army and local armed forces in various places also universally inspected the relationship between the army and the people and helped the masses with land reform and other work, further strengthening the relationship between the army and the people.
