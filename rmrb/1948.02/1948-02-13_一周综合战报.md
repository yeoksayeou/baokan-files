Weekly Comprehensive War Report, February 5th to 11th:

	Northern Front: Following the great victory at Xinlitun on January 26th, the Northeast People's Liberation Army captured Liaoyang, an important satellite stronghold 120 li southwest of Shenyang, on the 6th. The entire defending enemy New 5th Army's Provisional 54th Division, the 52nd Army's Transport Regiment, and a traffic police corps, along with the remaining personnel of the New 5th, New 6th, and 52nd Armies, totaling nearly 10,000 men, were annihilated. Numerous enemy officers above the rank of major, including the deputy commander and chief of staff of the Provisional 54th Division, were captured. The New 5th Army, painstakingly formed by the bandit leader Chen Cheng before the winter offensive, was completely wiped out in just one month. The capture of Liaoyang has opened a large gap in the southern defense line of the bandit stronghold of Shenyang. The enemy's isolated strongholds along the southern section of the Chinese Changchun Railway, including Anshan, known as the "Iron Capital of Manchuria," and Yingkou, the so-called supply port, have been left far behind the powerful People's Liberation Army. The seriousness of the blow suffered by the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast can be seen from the bandit leader Wei Lihuang's panicked "emergency meeting held late into the night by candlelight" and the fact that the bandits Chen Cheng and Zheng Dongguo also urgently flew to Nanjing to "seek help."
	
	Southern Front: The Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Liberation Army recovered Qianjiang in central Hubei on the 2nd, and Guangshan in southeastern Henan on the 4th. The Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui People's Liberation Army routed a portion of the Kuomintang 545th Brigade, which had advanced from Taikang, west of Taikang on January 29th. From East China to the Northwest, local armed forces and militias in various regions are actively mopping up Kuomintang bandits and local bullies, repeatedly achieving victories. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu local armed forces recovered Weichuan on January 20th. The local armed forces in western Henan wiped out the bandit stronghold of Stone Monkey Mountain east of Yiyang City on January 23rd, annihilating more than 200 Kuomintang bandits. From January 26th to February 3rd, a week, the areas of Yiyang, Lushi, Nanzhao, and Yunxi collectively annihilated 460 Kuomintang bandits. The majority of the troops of the habitual bandit Ye Laoliu, the joint commander of the enemy's Yiyang, Luoning, and Mianchi counties, who entrenched themselves in Hancheng town west of Yiyang, were annihilated, and the Yiyang Kuomintang puppet county government and eight township offices were also completely wiped out. On January 28th, the 5th Military Sub-district's local armed forces also annihilated more than 150 bandits under the notorious local bandit Huang Wanyi in Linru. At the end of last month, the Central China local armed forces shattered the Kuomintang bandits' desperate "mopping-up" operations involving twelve regiments, annihilating more than 6,500 enemies and successively capturing 30 strongholds including Shigang in Nantong, Shizhuang in Rugao, Chahe in Rudong, Gaoji in Lingbi, and Caiwei Lugou in Suqian. On January 17th, a portion of the enemy in Longkou, Jiaodong, ventured out to attack the suburbs of the city but were routed by our besieging troops, with more than 700 enemies annihilated. On the 27th, the Changyi militia captured an enemy motorboat loaded with munitions and more than 100 Kuomintang bandits. On the 17th, a unit of the Central Shandong People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang bandits "mopping up" the Yangqiu Mountain area in the triangle region of Tai'an, Laiwu, and Licheng, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 200 bandits; at the same time, militias in Boshan, Zhangqiu, Licheng and other places cooperated with the enemy outside the lines, also annihilating more than 200 bandits. On January 28th, the Taihang local armed forces and militia of the Jinji-Hebei-Lu-Yu region captured Xiaoxinzhuang south of Anyang. Militias on the outskirts of Jiaozuo also took the initiative to attack Kuomintang bandits抢粮 (snatching grain), annihilating more than 200 enemies in the two battles. In mid-January, the cavalry of the Northwest Suiyuan-Mongolia People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 500 troops of the Fu Zuoyi bandit Zhu Qimei, the Mongolian bandit Qi Zhizhong, and others in the Fugu area, liberating vast areas. Recently, guerrillas around Yan'an and Guanzhong have also repeatedly annihilated scattered Kuomintang bandits, recovering much of the grain and livestock that had been looted.
