Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: Late News: Guerrilla warfare is active among the military and civilians in the coastal areas of northern Jiaodong. The bandits entrenched north of Weihaiwei City were out of food and firewood. On the 7th, 8th, and 17th of last month, they assembled more than 700 police and special agents in three attempts to enter the city to loot, but were repelled by our military and civilians, with a total of 57 enemies killed, wounded, or captured. Currently, our troops control the villages of Qiaonan and the seaside in the urban area during the day, and the entire city at night. The Lin Hualong demolition team, active in the suburbs of Penglai City, compressed the enemy from the east, west, and south sides of the city. They laid mines everywhere around enemy bunkers and on important roads, killing and wounding 98 enemies in one month, powerfully supporting the masses in the suburbs in their struggle against grain robbery. The local armed forces of Wei (County) Nan (Xin County) fought 10 battles in 20 days, killing and wounding 61 enemies and capturing 41 alive. In addition, the local armed forces of Muping and Wulong (newly established county in southern Laiyang) also annihilated 67 enemies in Chenjia, southeast of Yantai, and Jiang Gezhuang, north of Jimo, respectively.
