From Workers and Peasants Back to Workers and Peasants
Reflections of Three District Cadres at the Taihang Sixth Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting

    邢崇智 Reflects on False Reports
    Comrade Xing Chongzhi is currently the secretary of the First District Committee of Shexian County. His family background is that of a new middle peasant. He has received some education and is currently 21 years old. He joined the Party in 1943 and started working in 1945.

    Last spring, when working on cadre-mass relations, I went to ××× village wanting to make a splash and show off. I first mobilized poor and hired peasants to offer opinions on the cadres, but then I went to the cadres to comfort them, saying they would still be able to achieve merits in the future! I was trying to be a good person to both sides. Later, I forced the masses to discuss and award merits to the cadres, but the masses just couldn't seem to grasp my topic. The masses said: "Cadre ××× shielded a landlord, that's no merit." I said: "The cadre has already made a self-criticism regarding his shortcomings. We should only talk about the good points, not the bad points." In order to come up with something novel and show off, I asked a Party member to be active among the masses and suggest hanging "Merit Plaques" for the cadres. This was all something I forced the masses to do, but when I reported to the district, I said it was all voluntary and conscious on the part of the masses. When I wrote articles for the newspaper, I wrote it the same way.

    When promoting production, conservation, and famine preparedness in ×× village, I thought to myself: ×× village is a model village, so I have to make it even more of a model. When helping the masses make conservation plans, I calculated 25 days as a month. Initially, I calculated half a jin of rice per person per day, but when that wasn't enough, I reduced it to six liang, and then to four liang. Only ten or so households in the whole village used scales to measure rice when they ate. I reported to the newspaper: "Every household in ×× village uses scales to measure their rice at every meal." When attending a meeting in the county, I wanted to compile my work achievements to report, so I just estimated a number. To make it believable, I deliberately made the number have both whole and fractional parts. I also wrote articles for the newspaper.

    The ×× village branch secretary is a lazy person. After picking up manure twice, I said he had turned around. Comrade ××, a Party member, was originally very lax in his position, but during the "July 1st" public Party day, in order to cater to the materials wanted by the higher-ups, I wrote that he was a model Party member and published it in the newspaper. In my work, I often used the typical materials from a few villages to represent the entire district's situation, turning slogans into actual actions. I deceived Lao Qiao (the district secretary at the time) when I went to the district. Lao Qiao took it to the county and deceived the county committee. The county committee said that the work in the First District wasn't bad, and the district cadres also said I was capable. I was completely trying to cater to the psychology of the higher-ups, hoping to be seen and promoted.

    杜进 Reflects on Punishing Poor and Hired Peasants
    Comrade Du Jin is in charge of propaganda for the Shahe sub-committee. His family background is poor peasant, and he worked as a hired laborer. He joined the Party in August 1940 and left home to work in 1943.

    When working in ×× village, I initially found that the village chief, the head of the Armed Forces Committee, and the militia captain were all rich peasants. But the Party members listened to them. When I asked who were the landlords and rich peasants, they replied: "Our village doesn't have any big households. Only one household lives in ×× village in ×× county, with over one qing of land." So, I mobilized the cadres, poor and hired peasants to struggle against him. The distribution of fruits of struggle was only discussed at a branch meeting. At the meeting, Party members competed to divide the fruits of struggle among themselves. Only some grain was left and given to some people who hadn't worked in the village in the past. The poor and hired peasants didn't get anything, so they were dissatisfied and opposed it. After that, the poor and hired peasants didn't go to the meetings anymore. The village chief, the head of the Armed Forces Committee, and the militia captain said to me: "You don't understand the situation. People in our village won't go unless they are punished." So, I discussed it with them and decided that whoever didn't come would be fined one jin of oil. At the evening meeting, the village cadres and activists came early to be counted. Rich peasants and middle peasants all came, but the poor and hired peasants and bachelors didn't come. Twenty poor and hired peasants were fined, totaling twenty jin of oil, as village office expenses. At the time, I thought it was very right. Now, reflecting on it, I completely followed the landlord and rich peasant line.

    There was a poor and hired peasant named ×× in ×× village. He didn't get any land in the rent reduction and land reform movement and was so hungry that he stole a radish and a handful of cowpeas from a rich peasant's field. The landlord saw him and wouldn't let it go, so I detained him. I didn't consider why he stole from others, I just said stealing was wrong. After discussing it with several cadres, we fined him. But then we beat him up and paraded him through the streets. In the past, landlords had watchdogs. Now, I ate and drank the poor and hired peasants' food and became a watchdog for the landlords and rich peasants, beating and punishing the poor and hired peasants, not thinking from their perspective.

    The movement in ×× village started very enthusiastically. When struggling against the big businessman landlord ×××, the masses hated him and wanted to struggle against him. But his son was the political director of our troops. During the struggle, a letter came saying a bunch of polite things. There were many landlords and rich peasants among the village cadres, and few poor and hired peasants. After receiving the letter, they came to me and said: "×××'s son is our cadre, we should take care of him, it's not right to struggle against him." I also thought that he was a director and a Party member and shouldn't be struggled against, so I went to the peasant association to explain: "It's right to offer opinions on ×××, but his son is serving as a political director in the army, his family is an anti-Japanese family, don't struggle against him." The masses didn't say anything. I then said: "Think about it, if we struggle against him, who is his son fighting for on the front lines?" The masses were even more silent. I then said: "If we struggle against him, he is a counter-revolutionary." I used these words to suppress the masses. Now I reflect on who is the counter-revolutionary? It is I who is with the feudal forces as a counter-revolutionary, not the masses. I was supporting the landlords and rich peasants to attack the poor and hired peasants. Now I understand, I really was suppressing and attacking the poor and hired peasants.

    刘士保 Reflects on Distributing Too Many Fruits of Struggle
    Comrade Liu Shibao is currently in charge of propaganda for the Shexian sub-committee. He comes from a poor peasant family. He joined the Party in 1945 and only started working in the district in 1946.

    I was born a poor peasant, but I turned myself around in the Double Reduction movement. In 1945, I became a middle peasant. Last year, during the movement, I went to the district to become a cadre. I was very satisfied with the May 4th Directive because although my family had land, we still had very little furniture and no house. If we carried out land reform, I could still get something. In 1946, during the land reform movement, I was assigned to work in ×× village. After a major struggle in my village, the village cadres sent someone to call me back to help distribute the fruits of struggle. At that time, I was leading the masses in struggle in ×× village. I thought: "Should I go back? I can't put down the work here. If I don't go back, I'm afraid I won't get any fruits of struggle, or they'll give me less." For my own benefit, I decided not to lead the masses and went home to distribute the fruits of struggle. Before distributing the fruits of struggle, we first discussed it in the branch. The village cadres and I unanimously agreed that we should give more to the Party members, because if the Party members got more, I could get more too. I said at the branch meeting: "We've led the struggle for several years, this year we have to really turn ourselves around!" I suggested that Party members report what they needed first, because if I asked them to report first, they would also ask me to report, so I could get what I wanted. After everyone reported, when it was my turn to report, I said: I want a house, good bedding, and other furniture, etc. I thought, I'm a worker! I have to get a good quilt! I wasn't sure if I'd get what I wanted, so I proposed that Party members should make up two-thirds of the evaluation committee, so I could feel at ease. After I left, the village cadres went to the masses and educated them in the same way I did. They told the masses: "This year's distribution of the fruits of struggle will be based on merit." So, the first place was me, because I was selfish and influenced the village cadres, they used my name to distribute more fruits of struggle. When I went back and saw that I had been given a good house, tables, chairs, and a small donkey was exchanged for half a horse, I was still satisfied. But I was not satisfied with a coarse cloth quilt that was distributed to me. The masses told me: "The village cadres used your name to distribute more fruits of struggle." So, I was dissatisfied with the village cadres and went to the masses and said: "The village cadres distributed more fruits of struggle, we have to report it to the district." The masses reported it to the district, and the district secretary called me back to correct the fruits of struggle. I called three mass meetings, but only a few people came. I seized on this point to scold the cadres. Compared to the poor and hired peasants, I also distributed too many fruits of struggle. My purpose in mobilizing the masses was not to distribute the fruits of struggle well, but because I was not satisfied with the fruits of struggle distributed to me, I was retaliating against the village cadres. So, when returning the fruits of struggle, the village cadres only returned some tables and chairs, I returned half a horse, and took back my donkey, and then there was no more return. Because if we returned any more, I would have to return it too! So, the fruits of struggle were not returned thoroughly, I shielded the village cadres.

    My family has three people and eleven mu of land. Counting by population, my family has the most land in the whole village. But I don't have any labor power myself. The village farms it for me and I have to pay half the wages. Having a lot of land means a heavy burden, and I thought that planting some land wasn't enough to give to others. So, I asked the village cadres to sell my land. I wanted to sell the bad land and only plant the good land. When I was studying at the prefectural committee, I heard that the land was going to be equally distributed. I was not satisfied because if I had a lot of land, and we were going to distribute land equally, I would have to give it away. After returning to the village, the village cadres did not sell my land for me, I was not satisfied, so I actively sold the land. As a result, I sold two mu of land for 40,000 ocean. I wanted to sell the land and put the money into the store, to earn pure profits, which was better than farming, and it wouldn't be equally distributed, so I developed exploitative thoughts. But after I sold the land, the masses said: "People in Linxian County sold land after they heard the news at the meeting." They also said: "He is a district cadre, if we knew, we would sell the land too, and be able to distribute it." After the Land Law Outline was published in the newspaper, the village cadres complained about me, complaining that I didn't tell them.

    My small old donkey couldn't travel long distances. Every time I calculated travel expenses, I took out rice. There was no one at home to cut grass. I wanted to sell it, save the rice for travel, and be able to spend the money, so I sold it for 30,000 ocean. Together with the land sale, it was 70,000 ocean. I put 40,000 into the cooperative and used the remaining money to buy good quilts and blankets to build myself up. I thought that my personal belongings couldn't be equally distributed, and if I dressed well, others would look up to me. When I worked, I shouted to the masses every day to save, but when I went home, I ate white flour every day, with eggs, and didn't even want to eat rice.

    When I was working in ××, I also pretended at first, calling for sending food to the poor and hired peasants' homes. But after the people who were sent ate one meal, and I saw that their houses were so dirty, I pretended to be sick and didn't go anymore.

    Although I am from a working background, after I turned myself around, I forgot about the poor and hired peasants. I completely degenerated, without any poor and hired peasant perspective, taking advantage of opportunities, sabotaging equal distribution. If everyone was like me, the land reform would not be thorough.

    太行六地委整党会上三个区干部的反省 
    邢崇智反省假报告
    邢同志现任涉县一区分委书记，家庭成份是新中农，读过书，现在二十一岁，一九四三年入党，一九四五年参加工作。
    去年春天，搞干群关系时，我到×××村想搞一手，显示自己。先发动贫雇给干部提意见，但又去干部那里安慰干部，说以后还要立功哩！这样两面为好人。到后来硬叫群众讨论，给干部立功，群众怎样也讨论不到我的题目上。群众说：“干部×××包庇地主没有功。”我说：“缺点，干部已经检讨过了，光准说优点，不准说缺点。”并为了弄个花样，表现自己，我叫一个党员到群众中活动，提意见，给干部挂“功劳匾”。这本是我强制群众搞的，到区上汇报，都是说是群众自觉自愿的，并向报纸写稿，也是这样写。
    在××村搞生产节约备荒时，我心想：××村是个模范村，总要叫他更模范些。在帮助群众订节约计划时，二十五天也算成一月，开始每人一天以半斤米计算，不够又降到六两，又降到四两。全村只有十来户用秤秤米吃的，我就向报纸报导：“××村家家每顿吃米用秤秤。”到县开会时，我想把工作成绩统计起来汇报，于是就估计了个数目字，并为了使人相信，故意估计成有整有零的数，并向报纸写了稿子。
    ××村支书，是个懒汉，拾了二次粪，就说他转变了。党员××同志本来立场很马虎，在“七一”公开党时，为了迎合上级要的材料，就写成他是模范党员，登在报上。在工作中，常常是以几个村的典型材料，写成全区情况，把口号写成实际行动。我到区上欺骗老乔（当时区书），老乔带到县上，欺骗县委。县委说，一区工作不坏，区干部也说我能干。我完全是为了迎合上级心理，希望看起自己，提拔自己。
    杜进反省处罚贫雇
    杜同志是沙河分委宣传，家庭是贫农，当过雇工，一九四○年八月入党，一九四三年离家工作。
    在××村工作，开始找着村长、武委会主任、民兵队长都是富农，但是党员听了他们的话，当问谁是地主富农，回答说：“咱村就没大户，只有一户是在××县的××村住着，有一顷多地。”就发动干部、贫雇将他斗了。分果实只是开了个支部会研究，会上是党员互相争分果实，只留了一些粮食，给了一些过去在村上不劳动的人，贫雇一点没分，就不满反对，以后贫雇开会就不去了。村长、武委会主任、民兵队长对我说：“你不了解情况，我村群众不罚就不去。”我就与他们商量了，决定谁不到罚油一斤。晚上开会，村干部和积极分子，先到就点名，富农、中农都到，贫雇和光棍汉没到，一点名罚了二十个贫雇，共二十斤油，作为村办公费。当时我认为很对，现在反省，完全走了地主富农路线。
    ××村有个××是贫雇，在减租土地改革中，没得到地，饿的没法，到地偷了富农一个萝卜、一把豆角。被地主见了不行，我就把他扣起来，没有考虑为啥偷人家的，光说偷不对，与几个干部商量了一下，罚他没有啥，就把人家打了一顿，又叫游街。过去地主有看门狗，现在我吃了喝了贫雇的，去当地主富农的看门狗，打贫雇，罚贫雇，没有从贫雇着想。
    ××村开始运动搞得非常热烈，斗争大经营地主×××时，群众对他仇恨，要斗他，但他儿子是咱们部队的政治主任，正斗争时，来了一信，说了一套客气话。村干部中破落地主富农成份多，贫雇少，接到信后找我说：“×××儿子是咱们干部，要照顾人家，斗争人家不对。”我思想亦觉得人家是个主任，是党员，不应斗，就去农会中解释说：“对×××提意见是对的，但他儿是在部队当政治主任，他家是抗属不要斗。”群众不吭，我又说：“大家想想，要斗了，人家儿子在前方为谁去的？”群众更不吭，我又说：“斗了人家是反革命。”用这话压制群众。这次我反省究竟谁反革命？是我和封建势力在一起反革命，不是群众反革命，是给地主富农撑腰来打击贫雇。我这时清楚了，我真是压制打击贫雇。
    刘士保反省多分果实
    刘同志现任涉县分委宣传，贫农成分，一九四五年入党，一九四六年才到区上工作。
    我是贫农出身，但在双减运动中，就翻了身。一九四五年成了中农。去年运动，我就到区上当干部。五四指示，我很满意，因为我家虽然有了土地，但家具还很少，也没有房子，要是进行土地改革，我还能分到东西。一九四六年土地改革运动时，分配我到××村工作，我村大斗争过后，村干部派人去叫我回去，帮助分果实，这时我正在××村领导群众斗争，我想：“回去吧？这里工作放不下，不回去，怕不分给自己果实，或者叫我少分。”为了自己利益，还是不领导群众，回家去分果实。在分果实前，先在支部讨论，我和村干部一致意见，愿意叫党员多分，因为党员多分，自己也能多分。我在支部会上说：“咱领导斗争几年了，今年可要好好翻身哩！”我出主张，先叫党员自报，自己需要什么？因为我叫他们自报，他们也要叫我自报，可以得到满意。大家报完，叫我报时，我说：我要房子，好铺盖，和其他家具等。我想，我当工作员哩！可得分个好被子哩！我提出自己的要求，恐怕不保险，又提议评议员中，党员要占三分之二，这样我才放了心。我走后，村干部到群众中，还是照我那样去教育群众，他们给群众说：“今年分果实，要按功劳分。”因此第一名就是我，因为我自私自利，影响了村干部，他们借我的名，多分果实。我回去一看，我分上了好房子，桌椅条杌，一个小驴换了半个马，这我还都满意，但分给我一个粗布夹被子我不满。群众给我说：“村干部借我的名，多分了果实。”因此我对村干部不满，就到群众中活动说：“村干部多分了果实，要向区反映。”群众反映到区，区书叫我回去，纠正果实，我召集了三次群众会，只去了几个人，我就抓住这一点训干部。我比起贫雇，也多分果实，我发动群众目的，不是想把果实分好，而是因给我分的果实不满我的意，向村干部报复。所以到退果实时，村干部只退出些桌椅板凳，我退出半个马，收回我的驴，就再没有退。因为再退的话，我也得退哩！所以果实没退彻底，我包庇了村干部。
    我家三口人，十一亩地，按人口算，全村数我地多。但我自己没劳力，村上代耕，还得出一半工资。地多出负担又重，我想种些地还不够给人家哩，因此我就叫村干部给我卖地。我想把坏地卖了，光种好地打算。在地委学习时，听说要平分土地，我不满意，因为我地多了，要平分，我还得往外拿。回村后，村干部没有给我卖了地，我不满，就积极卖地，结果卖了二亩地，洋四万元。我想卖了地，把钱入到商店，净赚红利，比种地强，也平分不了，自己产生了剥削思想。但我卖地后，群众说：“人家在林县开会，听到消息才卖地。”又说：“人家当区干部哩，咱要知道，咱也要卖地哩，卖了地，还能分。”报上登出土地法大纲后，村干部瞒怨我，嫌我不对他们说。
    我一个小老驴，不能出长差，每次算差帐，往出拿米，家里又没人割草，我想卖了它，省的出差出米，又能花钱，又卖了洋三万元，连卖地共七万元，入到合作社四万元，留下的钱，自己买了好被子、毯子，来建设自己。我想我个人东西，啥也平分不了，并且穿的好了，叫别人看起我。我做工作，每天对群众喊叫节约，我回家成天吃白面，还配鸡蛋，米都不想吃。
    我在××工作时，开始也是装腔作势，叫往贫雇家派饭，但派的吃了一顿饭，看他家脏的不行，就装病不去了。
    我虽是劳动出身，但自己翻身后，忘了贫雇，完全蜕化，没有一点贫雇观点，投机取巧，破坏平分，要都象我这样，土地改革就不能彻底。
