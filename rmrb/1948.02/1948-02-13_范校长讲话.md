    Principal Fan's Speech
    Another report: Peking University Principal Fan made a speech at the school's ideological education meeting against the landlord element Zhai Moxin, which stated in brief: "Today's meeting was very successful. The comrades who attended demonstrated a high degree of seriousness and a high degree of class indignation. This shows that the comrades' revolutionary understanding has greatly improved in the land reform study.

    Zhai Moxin, this stubbornly unenlightened class alien element, infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party. This is proven by the facts everyone has stated, without a doubt. Now that the landlord and rich peasant elements have been purged, the masses undoubtedly have indignation, and demand his expulsion from the Party, removal from his post, and referral to the People's Court, is that good? Good. The opinions of everyone should be carefully considered by the Academic Committee. Please rest assured. However, I will announce again here that the purpose of studying land reform is to transform ideology. Fifteen hundred comrades at Peking University must get rid of bad ideas and expand Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades must firmly grasp this guiding principle. Point out the two paths of revolution and counter-revolution, explain the principles clearly, and except for those who are extremely stubborn, I think everyone is willing to take the path of light. We are reasonable people, and if the principles are explained clearly, those who are still stubborn and unwilling to change will be dealt with by other means. All Party members and non-Party comrades in our school should obey the Party Central Committee's principles and policies. The Party Central Committee's instruction is to oppose the physical elimination of landlords. As long as the landlords lower their heads, surrender their weapons, do not resist, and are willing to work, they will be allocated a piece of land to let them work. Through labor, they can even change their class status within a certain period of time. Our hatred is class hatred, which is to eliminate classes, not to eliminate human beings.

    In the study, the faults of not being serious and not being upright must be opposed and eliminated. What should be investigated must be investigated, and what should be questioned must also be questioned. Whether it is investigation or questioning, it cannot deviate from the facts or be unreasonable. It is not good to simply and rigidly question. Because ideological transformation is delicate and long-term, engaging in it clumsily will cause great harm, and we must be cautious.

    From the materials revealed by everyone about Zhai Moxin, we can draw the following experience: It is not terrible for class enemies to attack us from the outside, but it is troublesome to have them sneak into the revolutionary camp to sabotage. Class alien elements sabotage the revolution with three characters. Zhai Moxin's reactionary words and deeds can be used as proof. I will now point out these three characters. See if they are right? First: infiltrate. Second: provoke. Third: destroy. Zhai Moxin infiltrated the Party. He himself said that he wanted to become a member of the Party Central Committee at the age of fifty, wanting to infiltrate the Party's general headquarters to carry out sabotage, his ambition was very big. Once infiltrated, he would provoke. The facts about his provocations that the comrades discussed at the meeting were numerous. In short, he spread rumors, stirred up trouble, sowed discord, and used emotional appeals to create sectarianism. The purpose of provocation is destruction. The most important thing for the revolution is unity. Of course, our unity is based on principles. We must unite like steel, but he uses various methods to destroy unity and sow discord. ... Zhai Moxin infiltrated the Party in 1939. After nearly ten years of infiltration, wasn't he still exposed in front of the masses? Not only those who have infiltrated, provoked, and destroyed should confess; even those who have such thoughts should also reflect on themselves well during this study. That is one point.

    Second point: Zhai Moxin, what does the facts prove him to be? He is a despotic landlord. He is filled with landlord and rich peasant ideology, and has no trace of Marxism-Leninism. Do we have landlord and rich peasant ideology in our minds? More or less, we all do. We come from a semi-feudal society, so it is not surprising to have landlord and rich peasant ideology. As long as we examine ourselves and transform ourselves, we will not necessarily become landlord and rich peasant elements. We must shrink the landlord and rich peasant ideology in our minds bit by bit. Otherwise, if it expands, it will be very dangerous. Eliminate the landlord and rich peasant ideology in our minds as soon as possible. Our revolutionary nature will become stronger. ..."

    范校长讲话
    又讯：北大范校长在该校反地主分子翟墨新思想教育大会上发言，略称：“今天的大会很成功。各位到会的同志，表现出高度的严肃性，和高度的阶级义愤。这说明在土改学习中，同志们的革命认识大大提高了一步。
    翟墨新这个执迷不悟的阶级异己分子，是混进中国共产党来的。这由大家所讲的事实，千真万确地证明了。地富分子，被清算出来了，群众不成问题要义愤，要求开除他的党籍，撤消职务，送交人民法庭，好不好？好。大家的意见，学委总会要好好的考虑，请大家放心。不过我在这里再宣布一下，学习土改为的是改造思想。北大一千五百个同志，都要把坏思想去掉，扩大马列主义——毛主席思想。同志们要好好掌握这一方针。指出革命、反革命两条道路，把道理讲清楚，除十分顽固者外，我想都愿往光明大道走的。我们是讲道理的，道理讲清楚，还很顽固不改者，我们另有处分的办法。我校党员与非党同志都应当服从党中央的方针与政策，党中央的指示是反对肉体消灭地主。地主只要低了头、缴了械、不反抗、肯劳动，就分配一份土地给他，让他劳动，经过劳动还能在一定的时间内改变其成份。我们的仇恨，是阶级仇恨，是消灭阶级，不是消灭人体。
    在学习中，不严肃不正派的毛病，是必须反对与肃清的。当查的应查，当追问的也要追问。无论是查或追问，总不能脱离事实与不讲道理，一味生硬的追问是不好的。因为思想改造是细腻而长期的，鲁笨从事，为害甚大，不可不慎。
    大家对翟墨新所揭发的材料，得出这样的经验：阶级敌人从外面来攻击我们并不可怕，而钻到革命阵营里边来破坏，就麻烦。阶级异己分子破坏革命有三个字，翟墨新的反动言行可作证明，我现在把这三个字指出来，大家看对不对？第一个：钻。第二个：挑。第三个：破。翟墨新他是钻到党内来的，他自己说到五十岁时要当党中央委员，想钻到党的总司令部里进行破坏，野心大的很。钻进了就要挑。他的挑拨，同志们在会上谈的事实很多，总之是造谣生事，挑拨离间，感情拉拢，闹宗派。挑的目的是破坏。革命最要紧的是团结，当然我们的团结是有原则的，我们要团结得象钢铁一般，但是他用各种方法破坏团结，挑拨离间。…………翟墨新一九三九年钻进党来，钻了近十年，还不是在群众面前揭露了吗？不仅有钻、挑、破的行为的人要坦白；连有这类思想的人，在这次学习中也应当好好反省。这是一点。
    第二点：翟墨新，事实证明他是什么？是恶霸地主。他一脑子地富思想，毫无马列主义气味。我们脑子里是否有地富思想？或多，或少，都有。我们是从半封建社会来的，有地富思想，不奇怪。我们只要检讨与改造，不一定变成地富分子。我们要把脑子的地富思想一点一点缩小，不然，扩大起来，很危险。脑子中的地富思想尽快消灭了。革命性就会强大起来。…………”
