How the "Free" United States Received Me
by Gao Niechuk
Translated by Luo Fen

When I was invited to attend the Slavic Congress in the United States, I happily agreed. As a Soviet writer (namely, the author of the play "The Front"—Editor), I was eager to see the life and customs of the great country across the ocean and to convey my heartfelt respect to the American people on behalf of my great motherland.

As soon as the news of the Soviet delegation's visit to the United States spread, I received numerous telegrams—various social organizations inviting me to visit and to give reports on Soviet literature.

I agreed to all the invitations. I wanted to meet as many people as possible, hear their opinions, and tell them the truth about our country.

We flew from Moscow, passing through Berlin and London. Then we transferred to the steamer "@Meli" for a two-day voyage to New York. I was eager to see America from the sea—the skyscrapers of the smog-shrouded metropolis and the famous "Statue of Liberty" I had only seen in American movies. But en route, the captain received a radio message stating that the dockworkers in New York were on strike. Our steamer had to change course and head for the Canadian port of Halifax.

From Halifax to New York, we traveled by train.

Near the hotel where we were to stay, thousands of Americans had gathered. They had originally intended to greet our delegation at the station, making numerous phone calls to inquire about the arrival time of our train, but to no avail. Thus, due to the peculiar "accuracy" of the American railways, the welcome for the Soviet delegation was aborted.

The next morning, I was picked up and taken to the Soviet Consulate. There, I found a large pile of letters addressed to me. Various social organizations were calling me—wanting me to give speeches. "If you accepted all the invitations, you would need two months, speaking twice a day," the Consul told me. "I understand this is a great burden, but there is an agency trying to prevent you from speaking."

The United States Department of Justice showed such touching concern for me. Even several days before my arrival in the United States, this Department of Justice sent me a letter warning that if I did not register as a foreign agent and provide fingerprints, I would be punished as a criminal.

A similar letter was sent to Wanda Wasilewska, who had originally planned to come with us.

No, I don't believe it! During the war years, the Americans I met in Moscow told me so much about American democracy. They invited me to their country and emphasized that I would be their honored guest. They praised my screenplay "Mission to Moscow," calling it a work that helped my two great nations understand and approach each other.

I read the letters one by one again.

Dear Mr. Korneichuk: The literary symposium is scheduled for Monday evening... The chairman is Professor Simon Poulson of Columbia University.

"We have three Americans speaking, all leading figures in the literary world. Our proposed program is as follows: Your speech, along with translation, will take one hour. The remaining hour will be for questions and discussion..."

Dear Dr. Korneichuk: Please attend a most prestigious conference to be held at Brighton University.

"As you may know, Brighton University celebrated its bicentennial in 1946... Of the six conferences, one will be of particular interest to you—its main topic is: The Humanitarian Tradition of the Future Century. Your presence will give special pleasure to the 'Humanitarian Tradition' committee and will strengthen our belief that this conference will be recognized as a cultural milestone in improving American education.

Sincerely, A. Staffiel, Chairman of the 'Humanitarian Tradition of the Future Century' Conference."

"The Humanitarian Tradition of the Future Century": what a noble sound! But before me lay an official piece of white paper concisely written in black English—register as an agent, or we will throw you in jail, put your fingerprints on it, or we will throw you in jail. But if you really register and try to speak somewhere, a young police officer will quickly come to you: "Listen, you foreign agent, get in the paddy wagon."

The phone rang, and the Consul picked up the receiver.

"The people are asking about you. They are inviting you to speak tomorrow."

"No," I interrupted him, "get me a car."

"Where do you want to go?"

"I want to see the Statue of Liberty."

An hour later, I was already on the dock. In the distance, facing away from America, stood the Statue of Liberty. On the shore were hundreds upon hundreds of sailors; they were pacing back and forth nine steps at a time. Each person held a sign that read: "We are on strike, we demand humane living conditions..."

In the evening, about 20,000 people gathered in the "Madison Square Garden" hall.

When our delegation entered the guest seating area, everyone stood up and warmly greeted the guests from the Soviet nation. In this moment of excitement, we forgot about the letter from the U.S. Department of Justice. We saw, we felt, that even the most outrageous slanders against the Soviet Union could not shake the great prestige of the Soviet people in the eyes of the American people. When the chairman read Comrade Stalin's congratulatory message to the Slavic Congress, the walls seemed to be shaken by the applause and cheers of the 20,000-person gathering. We experienced an unforgettable moment.

After the U.S. Department of Justice issued its warning, I notified all the social organizations that had invited me to speak. I told them that, according to American "democratic" laws, guests from the Soviet Union would be imprisoned for giving speeches, and due to these unfortunate circumstances, I regrettably had to decline all the enthusiastic invitations.

I limited my activities in the United States to: giving three-minute speeches at various gatherings in New York and other cities, conveying the heartfelt greetings of the Soviet people to the American people, and thanking them for their assistance in the fight against fascism.

I was determined to abide by the laws of the country where I was temporarily residing. After all, as the saying goes: greeting and thanking are innocent. But that was not the case, and I received another threatening letter:

"...The Department of Justice has written to you, requiring you to register as a foreign agent. Therefore, we suggest that you do so immediately to avoid our use of coercive measures..."

Two days later, a third letter arrived, warning that, according to the law, I was already at risk of being sentenced to two years in prison and fined $1,000.

To put it mildly, I was already feeling somewhat suffocated in the "free" United States, so I decided to return home immediately.

Before departing, we went to Hyde Park to lay a wreath at F. Roosevelt's tomb. We paid our respects to the remains of this great son of the American people, whose ideals were buried by the current rulers of the United States on the day he died. We were invited to visit the former president's house and museum. The museum contained gifts given to Roosevelt from almost every country in the world. On the walls were many photos: Roosevelt awarding American medals to officers and soldiers of the Allied forces. But there was not a single photo of the president awarding medals to Soviet aviators and sailors. In the center of the photos was a photo of Roosevelt and Churchill together, but there was not a single photo of Roosevelt with Stalin. There was nothing in the museum related to the Soviet Union, the great ally of the United States in the fight against fascism.

I asked the museum curator: "Why are there no photos of Roosevelt with Stalin? Their historic meeting was known throughout the world."

He replied: "There were some at first, but they were all taken away later for some reason."

His face turned red.

Even in such sacred things to the American people as the Roosevelt Museum, the dirty claws of American fascists had destroyed all that reflected the best and greatest things in history during the days of the great trial of all the freedom-loving nations of the world.

In the "free" United States, neither the threats of the Department of Justice nor the rude slanders spread by various reactionary newspapers pointing fingers at my name insulted me as much as the shameless fabrication of history in the Roosevelt Museum.

But it would be unfair to say that there is no "freedom" at all in the present-day United States. I saw a parade in downtown New York City, made up of Polish fascists. At the head of the procession was a truck carrying a woman dressed in white, with a crown of thorns on her head. Next to her sat gentlemen disguised as pregnant bellies, wearing gloves and ragged clothes. They were dressed as Polish "peasants," and the woman in white was "Poland." Opposite the woman stood a young man dressed as a Red Army soldier, roughly made up in the style of Kuzma Kryuchkov, holding a bayonet aimed at the woman's chest. On the roof of the car was a cloth banner that read: "Save Poland from the clutches of the Bolsheviks."

Dozens of bands shook the whole of New York City. Drummers wearing Polish costumes stirred up an unbelievable uproar, and mounted and foot police protected this anti-Soviet, anti-Polish democratic government demonstration.

Goebbels himself would have admired the slogan written on that banner.

All this was carried out with the permission and close protection of the American government.

Along with these Polish fascists walked their American bosses. These bosses smiled happily, patting their servants on the shoulders.

It is worth mentioning that if the tens of thousands of Polish workers in Detroit—whose delegation asked me to convey their warmest greetings to the new Poland, to its government and people—were to hold a parade to celebrate their beloved, great, and free Poland of today, who could they expect to protect them?

Such is the order of today's "free" America. That is how writers are received there, how the representatives of the people who fought hand in hand with the American people for peace, democracy, and freedom are received.

### “自由的”美国是怎样接待我的

    “自由的”美国是怎样接待我的
    高涅楚克作
    罗芬译
    当我被邀赴美国出席斯拉夫人的代表大会的时候，我欣喜地同意了。我是一个苏联作家（即剧本“前线”的作者——编者），愿意见识见识大洋彼岸的大国的生活与习俗，并代表我伟大的祖国，向美国人民转致衷心的敬意。
    苏联代表团赴美的消息刚一传到美国时，我就接到许许多多的电报——各式各样的社会团体请我去拜访，请我去作关于苏联文学的报告。
    我对所有的邀请都同意了。我想尽可能多接触一些人，听听他们的见解并给他们谈谈我们祖国的真实情形。
    我们乘飞机从莫斯科出发，经过柏林和伦敦。随后改乘火轮“＠麦利”号，在去纽约的航路上走了两天。我很想从海上看看美国——看看被烟雾笼罩的大城市的摩天楼和我仅仅从美国电影上见过的有名的“自由女神”的塑像。但是在路上船主接到了无线电报，说是纽约的码头工人罢工了。我们的火轮便只得改变了航路，向加拿大的港口哈利法克斯驶去了。
    从哈利法克斯到纽约，我们是乘的火车。
    在我们要下榻的旅馆附近，聚集了几千美国人。他们原想去车站迎接我们的代表团，打了好多次电话，询问我们坐的火车什么时候到达，但都没有成功。这样，由于美国铁路的特殊的“精确性”，对苏联代表团的欢迎就流产了。
    第二天早上，我被接到苏联领事馆。那里有一大堆写给我的信件。各式各样的社会团体打电话给我——要我去讲演。“要是你接受了所有的邀请，你得用两个月，而且一天讲演两次，”领事对我说道：“我明白，这是一个很大的负担，但是，有一个机关在竭力阻止你去演讲。”
    美国司法部对我表示了如此动人的关切。还在我抵达美国好几天以前，这个司法部就给我送去了一封信，信上警告说，如果我不以一个外国使节的身份去登记并且盖压手印的话，那我就会被当作刑事犯受惩罚的。
    同样的信，还有一封是给原拟和我们同来的汪达·叶四列夫斯卡亚的。
    不，我不信！在战争时日里，我在莫斯科遇着的美国人，给我讲过好多美国的民主。他们请我到他们的国家来，而且还强调说，我将是他们的上宾。他们称赞过我的剧本“赴苏使命”，把他称作有助于我两大民族互相了解与接近的作品。
    我把信一封一封的又读了一遍。
    亲爱的高涅楚克先生：文艺座谈会订于星期一傍晚举行……主席是哥伦比亚大学教授西蒙蒲松先生。
    “我们有三个美国人讲话，他们都是文学界的先进人士。我们拟定的程序是这样：你的讲演连同翻译的占一小时。余一小时为发问与讨论………”。
    亲爱的高涅楚克博士：请你参加一个最有名的会议，该会在布莱顿大学举行。
    “或许你知道，布莱顿大学在一九四六年举行其二百周年纪念…………六个会议中，有一个将使你特别感到兴趣，——它的主要题目是：未来世纪的人道主义传统。你的莅临将给‘人道主义传统’委员会以特别的快慰并将加强我们的信念，即这个会议在改进美国教育上将被认作是文化的路标。
    ‘未来世纪人道主义传统’会议长，你的诚挚的Ａ·斯塔菲耳。”
    “未来世纪的人道主义传统”：这是多么高贵的声音！但是在我面前却摆着一张官方的简明地写着黑的英文字的白纸——以使节的身份去登记，否则我们就把你关进牢里，捺上你的手印，否则我们就把你关进牢里。但你真要去登了记而且试图在什么地方讲演的话，一位警察署的青年就会很快走到你跟前来：“听着，你外国的使节，请上囚车吧。”
    电话响了，领事拿起听筒。
    “人民问着你呢。他们请你明天去讲演。”
    “不，”我打断他的话，“给我一辆汽车吧。”
    “你要到哪儿去？”
    “想去看看‘自由女神’的塑像。”
    一点钟以后，我已经在码头上了。远处，背向美国，立着“自由女神”的塑像。海岸上有成百成百的水手；他们数着步子，来回九步地走着。每个人手上都拿一块牌子，牌上写着：“我们罢工，我们要求人的生活条件”………
    傍晚，在“麦迪逊广场花园”大厅里，聚结了约两万人。
    当我们代表团进入来宾席的时候，全体起立，向苏维埃国家来的宾客们热烈致敬。在这兴奋的时刻，我们忘记了美国司法部的信。我们看见，我们感觉出，对于苏联最放肆的诽谤，都不能够动摇苏联人民在美国人民眼中的伟大的威望。当主席读完斯大林同志致斯拉夫人代表大会的贺电之后，四壁都好象为一个两万人集会鼓掌与迎呼的声音所震动了。我们经历了永不能忘记的时刻。
    在美国司法部提出警告之后，我通知了所有请我去讲演的社会团体，我告诉他们，因为按照美国的“民主”法律，从苏联来的客人，会因讲演而坐牢的，由于这些我无能为力的情况，我不能不惋惜地谢绝了所有热忱的邀请。
    我把我在美国的活动限制于：在纽约和其它城市的各个集会上，用三分钟的讲话，代表苏联人民向美国人民衷心地问好，并对在同法西斯主义作战时的帮助致谢。
    我决心遵守我暂居的国家的法律。要知道，民谣也说：问好和致谢是无罪的。但是事实不然，我又接到一封威胁的信：
    “………司法部给你写过信，要你一定以外国使节的身份登记。因此提议你马上作此事，以避免我们使用强制手段………”
    过了两天，来了第三封信，信里警告道，根据法律，我已经有受两年监禁和一千美元罚金的危险了。
    说得客气一点，我已经在“自由的”美国感到有些窒息了，于是我决定马上回国去。
    起程以前，我们去了一次海德公园——给Ｆ·罗斯福的陵墓供献花圈。我们向这位美国人民的伟大儿子的遗骸致敬，在他死的那一天，美国现时的执政者就把他的理想埋葬了。我们被请去参观故总统曾居住的房子和博物馆。博物馆内收集了差不多世界各国送给罗斯福的礼物。墙上有许多照片：有罗斯福在给盟军的官兵们颁发美国的勋章。但是就没有一张照片，是总统在给苏维埃的航空员们和水兵们授奖的。在照片的正中有罗斯福和邱吉尔的合照，但是就没有一张照片是罗斯福同斯大林合照的。博物馆内没有一条东西是与反法西斯主义斗争中的美国的伟大盟友——苏联有关的。
    我问博物馆管理员：“为什么没有罗斯福同斯大林的照片？他们的有历史意义的会见本是全世界都知道。”
    他答道：“起初是有的，以后不知为什么都取去了。”
    随着他脸红了。
    甚至在象罗斯福博物馆这样美国人民的神圣的事物里，美国法西斯蒂的脏污的爪子，也毁灭了所有反映世界各受好自由民族在伟大考验日子里的，历史中最美好的，最伟大的东西。
    在“自由的”美国里，无论是司法部的威吓，无论是各个反动报章指着我名字散布的粗鲁的诽谤，都没有象罗斯福博物馆里对历史所作的无耻的捏造，这样使我感到侮辱。
    但是，说在现时的美国完全没有“自由”，也是不公道的。我看见过在纽约市中心的一次游行，这是些波兰的法西斯分子。在行列前面，走着一辆载重汽车，车上站着一位穿白衣服，头戴荆棘花冠的女人。她的旁边，坐着化装了的大肚子的绅士们，戴着手套，穿着破衣。他们装扮的是波兰的“农民”，而穿着白衣的女人呢——是“波兰”。女人对面站着位照库兹玛·克纽茨柯夫的样子胡乱化了装的年青人，穿着红军制服，他拿一把刺刀，对准女人的胸口。车顶上有一幅布上写道：“从布尔塞维克魔爪下救出波兰吧。”
    有好几十个乐队，把全纽约市都震动了。吹鼓手们穿着波兰服，掀起了令人难以置信的闹嚷，骑马和徒步的警察们保护着这个反苏、反波兰民主政府的示威游行。
    在那幅布上所写的标语，就是戈培尔也会赞叹的。
    所有这些，都是在美国政府的允诺与严密保护下进行的。
    同这些波兰的法西斯分子一起，走着他们的美国老板。这些老板们开心地微笑着，拍着自己的仆役们的肩膀。
    值得提起的，如果底特律的成千成万的波兰工人——他们的代表团请我向新的波兰、向它的政府和人民转达最热烈的敬意——为庆祝他们所热爱的、伟大和自由的今日的波兰而举行游行的话，能期望谁庇护他们呢？
    今天的“自由”的美国的秩序就是如此。那里就是如此接待作家们，如此接待那些为和平、民主与自由而同美国人民手牵手地战斗过的人民的代表们。
