    Democratic Village Government Returns Home
    Li Wuyan, Wei Ye
    After the People's Liberation Army arrived in the Dabie Mountains, the poor farmers of Chenjiachong Village in a certain county overthrew the local tyrants, organized poor peasant groups, and established a democratic village government. One day, the poor peasant group held a meeting to discuss where to set up the democratic village government. Someone suggested the Lianbao office, because everything was readily available there. This proposal was immediately opposed by everyone, who said, "That was built by the Kuomintang, who would go there?" At this time, the head of the poor peasant group, Ma Wanjun, suggested, "Let's go back to the Ge family ancestral hall, the old village Soviet!" As soon as he finished speaking, everyone said in unison: "Yes! The Red Army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) returns home, and our democratic village government must also return home!" The people at the meeting all ran to the Ge family ancestral hall. Ma Wanjun and a former member of the old village Soviet stood at the entrance of the ancestral hall, recalling the scene of fighting local tyrants and distributing land here in the past. Ma Wanjun picked up a wooden stick and hit the wall on the right side of the gate a few times. The random mud plastered on the wall fell off, revealing the bright white-background, red-lettered Village Soviet Land Program and twelve slogans such as "Fight Local Tyrants and Distribute Land" and "The Red Fourth Army and the People are One Family". At this moment, people shouted, "The village government must be located here!" Ma Wanjun raised his wooden stick again and hit the wall on the left side of the gate a few times, and slogans such as "Fight Local Tyrants and Distribute Land, So Everyone Has Food to Eat and Clothes to Wear" appeared on the wall. Ma Wanjun excitedly said: "In the past, this was the Fifth Village of the Fifth Township, and the Village Soviet was located here. We fought local tyrants and distributed land, held elections, and made revolution here. Our village was a model in the Fifth Township. Later, when the White Army (referring to the Chiang bandits) came, they plastered the slogans on the wall with mud and sealed the door of the Village Soviet. Now that the Red Army is back, our democratic village government has also returned home!" People shouted, "We must still be a model in the future!" Everyone cleaned the hall, and the next day the democratic village government of Chenjiachong moved into the ancestral hall to work.

    民主村政府还家
    李无言  魏叶
    解放军到了大别山后，某县陈家冲村的贫苦农民，打倒了土劣，组织起贫农小组，也成立了民主村政府。有一天，贫农小组开会讨论安设民主村政府的地点，有人提议在联保办公处，因为那里一切东西都齐备。这个提议马上遭到大家的反对，人们说：“那是国民党修的，谁到那里去”。这时候，贫农小组长马万举提议说：“还是到葛家祠堂老村苏维埃去吧”！话刚说完，人们一齐说：“对！红军（指解放军）还家，咱民主村政府也得还家”。开会的人一齐跑到葛家祠堂、马万举和一个过去的老村苏维埃委员站在祠堂大门口，回忆过去在这里打土豪和分田地的情景。马万举拿起一根木棍子，向大门右边墙上打几下，糊在墙上的乱泥土落下来，露出了鲜艳的白底红字的村苏维埃土地纲领和“打土豪分田地”“红四军和老百姓是一家人”等十二条标语。这时人们叫着说：“村政府一定要安在这里”。马万举又举起木棍在大门左边墙上打了几棍，墙上又露出“打土豪分田地，大家有饭吃有衣穿”的标语。马万举兴奋的说：“过去这里是第五乡第五村，村苏维埃就在这里办公。我们在这里打土豪分田地、开选举、闹革命，我们村在第五乡是模范。以后白军（指蒋匪）来了，把墙上的标语用泥糊住，封了村苏维埃的门。现在红军回来了，咱们的民主村政府也还家了”。人们嚷着说：“往后也还一定要做模范”。大家把大堂打扫干净，第二天陈家冲的民主村政府就搬到祠堂里办公。
