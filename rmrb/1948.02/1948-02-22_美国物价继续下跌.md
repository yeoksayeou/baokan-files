　　U.S. Prices Continue to Fall
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th】Reports from various sources: Wholesale and retail prices in the United States continued to fall on the 14th and 15th. Although there was a temporary rebound on the 16th, they continued to fall again on the 17th. On the 14th, the National Retail Food Merchants Association stated: "Food stores across the country have reduced the prices of flour, cured meat, ham, lard, vegetable oil, eggs, butter, pork, and beef." The reason for this is the prediction that wholesale prices will continue to fall. On the 15th, a United Press survey in sixteen cities showed that wholesale prices fell as follows: On the 14th, Chicago corn for May delivery fell to $1.9725 per bushel, a decrease of $0.735 from the price on January 16. Wheat futures also fell by as much as five cents. Minneapolis wheat for May delivery fell six cents per bushel, while Kansas City wheat for May delivery fell four and a half cents at the opening; New York cotton fell about four dollars per bale at the opening. The decline in retail prices of grain and food often precedes wholesale prices. According to TASS, New York: U.S. prices continued to fall on the 17th. The index of wholesale prices for thirty-five commodities was 187.2, a decrease of 1.15 from the temporary rebound of 188.35 on the 16th. Chicago wheat fell 3.5 to 4.5 cents per bushel, and corn and oats also fell, while cotton prices showed a significant decline.

　　美国物价继续下跌
    【新华社陕北十九日电】各方讯：美国批发与零售物价，十四、十五两日仍普遍下跌。十六日虽曾一度假象回涨，而十七日又继续下跌。十四日，全国零售食品商联合会称：“全国各地食品店均已减低面粉、腌肉、火腿、猪油、菜油、蛋类、牛油、猪肉及牛肉的价格”。其原因是预测到批发价格将不断下落。十五日，合众社在十六个城市所作的调查，批发物价跌落的情形为：十四日，芝加哥玉蜀黍五月期货已跌至每蒲式尔一元九角七分二厘五，较一月十六日的物格下跌七角三分五厘。小麦期货跌价仍有高达五分者。明尼亚玻利斯城小麦五月期货每蒲式尔跌价六分，堪萨斯城小麦五月期货则于开盘时下跌四分五；纽约棉花开盘时每包跌价四元左右。而粮食与食品的零售价格的跌落，常常在批发物价之前。据塔斯社纽约讯：美国物价十七日继续下跌。三十五种商品批发价格的指数为一八七·二，较十六日之假象回涨的一八八·三五，又回跌了一·一五。芝加哥小麦每蒲式尔下跌三分半至四分半，玉蜀黍和燕麦亦有跌落，棉花价格则跌势显著。
