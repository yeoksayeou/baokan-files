　　Second Economic Storm in Chiang-Controlled Areas After the New Year
  　Shanghai Prices Rise Even More Fiercely
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to various sources: Shanghai prices are still rising in a tortuous manner. On the 16th, rice was sold for 210,000 yuan per dan in Chiang currency, an increase of 15% in one day. The black market exchange rate for US dollars rose by 20% within a few hours, reaching 215,000 yuan in Chiang currency per dollar. The price of gold per tael (10 taels) on the 17th had risen from US$560 to US$700, exceeding the Chiang bandit's official price of US$400 by 60%. The market prices of other goods such as soap, matches, cigarettes, wool fabrics, and glassware have all risen by 15% to 40%. Foreign news agencies also acknowledge that as a result of Chiang currency "constantly pouring out of the printing presses, its value is decreasing every hour," prices are bound to rise more sharply. According to reports, this wave of price increases began on the 2nd of this month, marking the second economic storm in the Chiang-controlled areas after the New Year. On the 2nd, the price of rice in Shanghai rose to 1.55 million yuan per dan, on the 5th to 1.66 million yuan, and on the 6th to 1.8 million yuan. It had risen to 2.4 million yuan during the Lunar New Year, then fell for a while, but quickly rebounded. Taking rice as an example, the current price is 30% higher than the highest price of 1.6 million yuan during the first economic storm.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to foreign news agency reports: The prices of general commodities in Shanghai have risen again. The price of rice per shi dan reached a new record of 2.4 million yuan during the Lunar New Year, a 60% increase in one month compared to the New Year in the Gregorian calendar.

　　新年后蒋区第二个经济风暴
  　上海物价涨得更凶
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据各方消息：上海物价仍曲折上升。十六日大米每担已售至蒋币二十一万元，一日之内，涨达百分之十五；美钞黑市数小时之内，上涨百分之二十，每元合蒋币二十一万五千元；黄金每条（十两）十七日已由五百六十美元涨至七百美元，较蒋匪官价四百美元，超出百分之六十。其他各物，如肥皂、火柴、香烟、毛织品、玻璃物品等市价均上涨百分之十五至百分之四十。外国通讯社亦承认：由于蒋币“不断由印刷机涌出，值价每小时都在降低”之结果，物价势将更剧烈上涨。按此次涨风自本月二日开始，为新历年后蒋区第二个经济风暴。二日上海米价每担即涨至一百五十五万元，五日涨至一百六十六万元，六日一百八十万元，至旧历新年时曾涨至二百四十万元，后一度跌落，但转瞬之间，即又重新上涨。以大米为例，目前价格较第一次经济风暴最高价格一百六十万元，高出百分之三十。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据外国通讯社消息：上海一般商品价格又作新的上涨。大米价格在旧历新年中每市担曾创二百四十万元之新纪录，较阳历新年时一个月内又高涨百分之六十。
