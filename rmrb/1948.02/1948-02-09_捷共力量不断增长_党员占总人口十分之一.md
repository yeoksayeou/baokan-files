Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Prague dispatch: As the Czech parliamentary election is about to be held, the prestige of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CCP) among the people has further increased. According to the CCP Central Committee's organ, "Red Flag," the number of new party members who joined the party in January of this year reached 44,161, including 112 officers of various ranks. The total number of CCP members has reached 1,354,601, accounting for one-tenth of the country's total population. Party members in various places are still increasing, and former members of the National Socialist Party and the People's Party have successively applied to join the party. When the General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, Slánský, delivered a speech at a mass meeting sponsored by the CCP's North Moravian Party Committee a few days ago, he solemnly pointed out: "The upcoming election campaign will be a struggle between the progressive and socialist forces and the remnants of the exploiting classes." Slánský strongly condemned: "The Czech reactionaries who have now joined the National Socialist Party, the People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party are trying to restore the old rule and want to make Czechoslovakia an appendage of American imperialism." Slánský then expressed that as this general election is approaching, we would like to see honest people in the above-mentioned parties break with the reactionary policies of their parties. Slánský finally stated: "The CCP has a sufficiently strong force to accomplish its current tasks. Because the Communist Party implements policies that conform to the interests of the people and the country, its strength is constantly growing."

    【新华社陕北七日电】布拉格讯：当捷克议会大选即将举行之时，捷共在人民中的威信更加增长。据捷共中央机关报“红旗报”称：本年一月份入党之新党员，达四万四千一百六十一人，包括各级军官一百十二名。捷共产党员总数已达一百三十五万四千六百零一人，占全国总人口十分之一，现各地党员仍在继续增加中，并有前民族社会党及人民党党员陆续申请入党。捷共中央总书记斯朗斯基日前在捷共波德摩拉党委所主催的群众大会上发表演说时，郑重指出：“行将到来的竞选运动，将是进步的和社会主义的力量与剥削阶级残余之间的斗争”。斯氏痛斥：“现在加入民族社会党、人民党和斯洛伐克民主党的捷克反动派，正力图恢复旧统治，想使捷克成为美帝国主义的附属国”。斯氏继表示在此大选即将到来之时，我们愿见到上述诸党的正直人士与他们党的反动政策相决裂。斯氏最后并称：“捷共有足够强大的力量来完成他当前的任务。共产党因为执行符合人民与国家利益的政策，它的力量正不断增长。”
