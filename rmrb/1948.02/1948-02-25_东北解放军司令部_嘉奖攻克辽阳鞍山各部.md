Northeast PLA Headquarters
　　Commends Units for Capturing Liaoyang and Anshan
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, February 23rd】 The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters issued a commendation order to all commanders and fighters of the field army and artillery units that captured Liaoyang and Anshan. It expressed its heartfelt congratulations to the units for their glorious victory in annihilating the enemy's 54th Provisional Division in Liaoyang and then annihilating the enemy's 25th Division in Anshan in continuous battles. It also encouraged the units to continue annihilating the enemy and strive for greater victories.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, February 23rd】 A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in the battle to capture Zhangwu, adopted the method of collective brainstorming before the battle, combined with repeated exercises, and created a model for siege warfare. Many soldiers in this unit were very excited when the siege mission was about to be issued and were eager to act immediately. In response to this situation, the leadership promptly proposed: "Whoever comes up with the best method will be given the main task this time." This transformed the soldiers' eagerness to fight into pre-battle preparation work. At that time, each squad and platoon immediately started discussions and worked out many specific methods for bridge-building, blasting, and bunker-busting, fully utilizing the collective wisdom and creativity of the soldiers. The unit's cadres focused on studying the enemy's situation and terrain, personally went to the enemy's outer strongholds that had recently been captured by our forces for on-the-spot inspections, and inquired with prisoners about the enemy's deep fortifications and the deployment of troops and firepower. After repeated investigations and studies, each company conducted detailed organizational division of labor, and each combat team further conducted thorough discussions, repeated four or five group exercises, and joint large-scale exercises. During the exercises, some errors were corrected until everyone's actions were completely proficient. As soon as the general attack order was issued, the entire force quickly entered the battle. Two squads passed through a 50-meter assault path in five minutes, blasted the deer antlers, and completed the bridge and ladder construction tasks. A certain platoon broke into the city in fifteen minutes, defeated the enemy's counterattack, and occupied the forward position, allowing subsequent troops to smoothly advance into the depths. The unit fought from the south city to the north city, capturing more than 40 courtyards and more than 100 bunkers, capturing more than 500 enemies, with very few casualties.
