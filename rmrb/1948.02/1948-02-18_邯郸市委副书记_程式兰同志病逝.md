    Comrade Cheng Shilan, Deputy Secretary of the Handan Municipal Party Committee, Passes Away
    [Handan News] Comrade Cheng Shilan (female), Deputy Secretary of the Handan Municipal Party Committee, passed away on the 28th of last month due to complications from a miscarriage caused by a fall, resulting in excessive blood loss. Comrade Cheng Shilan was a native of Xingcheng County, Liaoning Province. After the fall of Northeast China, she studied in Beiping and actively participated in the "December 9th" student movement. During the student movement, she demonstrated strong organizational skills, serving successively as the Organization Minister of the Northeast Women's National Salvation Association, Chairman of the Northeast Middle School Student Union, and captain of the Pioneer Zone. She joined the Communist Party in December 1935. After the "July 7th" Incident, she joined the Jixi Guerrilla and came to the Taihang Region. In 1938, she served as the Secretary of the Yuanshi County Party Committee, where her work demonstrated vigor and the ability to break new ground. In 1939, the Taihang Regional Party Committee designated Licheng, Zuoquan and other counties as experimental counties, and Comrade Cheng Shilan was transferred to serve as the Secretary of the Licheng County Party Committee. In the winter of 1940, Comrade Cheng Shilan was transferred to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the Women's Committee of the Taihang Regional Party Committee. Soon after, she was transferred to serve as the Secretary of the Xingtai County Party Committee. In 1944, she participated in the rectification movement. After the rectification, she assisted in the rectification work at the Taihang Regional Party Committee Party School. In the spring of 1946, she came to Handan City to serve as a member of the Municipal Party Committee, and soon after became the Deputy Secretary of the Handan Municipal Party Committee. After returning from the Central Bureau's land conference, she was already five months pregnant and suffering from stomach pains, but she did not slacken in her work, frequently going to Pang Village, five miles from the city, to mobilize poor peasants and farm laborers. On the afternoon of January 26th, while going to Pang Village, she fell on the railroad tracks. She returned that evening and still discussed work with Director Cao of the Handan Municipal Public Security Bureau. Comrades advised her to rest, but she was unwilling to delay work due to concerns about the miscarriage. On the 27th, she continued to persist in her work, and only rested on the morning of the 28th, but ultimately passed away due to excessive blood loss and her stomach ailment, which could not be remedied. Comrade Cheng Shilan was a cadre who had experienced the student movement, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the land reform. She was relatively outstanding and excellent among women cadres. Through the Party's rectification and organizational consolidation, she had undergone significant transformation. Comrades who worked with her deeply mourn her death. (Ping, Li)
