Peasants:

Our newspaper welcomes everyone to accuse landlords of their crimes, expose shortcomings in our work, promote those things that our peasants think are good and appropriate, and put forward your own demands and suggestions for improving work. All organizations, groups, and individuals mentioned by everyone must state their position. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to everyone's opinions should accept and implement them. If there are incorrect statements, explanations can be made, and different opinions can be put forward. Those who can write should write themselves. Those who cannot write can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write, or come to the newspaper in person, or write a letter to the newspaper to let us know, and we can find a way.

Wei Dianhua is fifty-six years old, from Xisu Village, Shahe Third District, and of poor peasant background. He is a Communist Party member and a retired veteran. However, he and his son were "framed" as "spies" by bad village cadres, and they were beaten to the point of death and still not released. Later, the masses bailed him out, but the bad village cadres still did not allow him to talk to anyone or leave the village. They also threatened him, saying, "If you go to the county to sue, you don't need to return to Xisu Village." Last year in the twelfth lunar month, his son went to another village to carry persimmons and happened to see someone reading the newspaper, reading the part about Xu Geng of Nan Congjing in Wu'an appealing for justice. He knew that even the greatest grievances could be appealed, so he pretended to pack things up and took the newspaper, went home and told his father. Wei Dianhua took the newspaper and secretly ran out of the village, asking for directions all the way until he finally found the newspaper office. When he talked, he would cry and be unable to continue. He was afraid that the bad village cadres would beat his son again when they saw him run away. He asked the government to take charge for him and quickly send someone to investigate and deal with the matter. Below is his complaint, written on his behalf by a comrade from this newspaper.

(I)

My family has been working as *mihan* (hired laborers) for landlords for three generations. My father and grandfather suffered for landlords their whole lives. My father died when I was four years old. There were thirteen people in my family, old and young, with only one uncle able to work. With many people and little land, we couldn't make ends meet, so we separated from my uncle in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu during a famine. We were given four *mu* of land. My mother and our siblings, five of us, I was the second oldest. When I was eight years old, we had nothing to eat at home, so I herded cattle for others. At first, I earned one string of five hundred cash coins a year, then two strings, three strings, up to four strings. I herded cattle and worked as a *mihan* for a full ten years.

When I was eighteen, after the autumn harvest, there was no work and nothing to eat, so I carried a clay pot, gathered firewood in the winter, and worked as a *mihan* for landlords in the spring. I worked one year to eat for one year, and one year passed completely. I worked as a *mihan* until I was forty. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, during a great famine, my wife, children, brothers and I fled to Yuhuangshan in Tunliu, Shanxi, where we lived by cutting firewood. Everyone else in my family fled elsewhere, leaving only my mother at home. My mother longed for everyone, and was hungry and lonely, so she died of illness and anger.

When I heard that my mother had died, I left my wife and children in the mountains, pawned a cotton coat for travel expenses, and rushed back day and night. When I got home, I didn't expect the neighbors to wrap her in a straw mat and help bury her! The next day, I hurried back because my travel expenses were not enough. If I delayed for one day, I couldn't go back, and my wife and children in the mountains would starve.

In the tenth year of the Republic of China, I returned from Shanxi. My older sister's husband died, so I found a husband for my sister, spent some money, bought three *mu* of land, and rented another four or five *mu* of land. My brothers and I worked as *mihan* for others, and we barely managed to avoid starvation year after year with coarse grains and vegetables.

When the Incident happened, the Eighth Route Army came, and I joined the resistance work and worked as a messenger in the district. I also joined the Communist Party. In the forty-second year, a famine came, and the whole family fled to Shanxi again. I was transferred to the enemy work station to deliver letters. At that time, the enemy built three lines of blockade, and delivering letters required crossing two lines of blockade and one Shahe River. Once, when crossing the Shahe River, the water was high, and I was almost washed away. For the sake of work, the enemy damaged my right eye! After Japan surrendered, because I was getting old, the superiors called for demobilization. I requested to retire, and the superiors approved me as a second-class disabled soldier and sent me home.

(II)

As soon as I returned home, I saw that the village cadres were all a bunch of landlords and rich peasants. Some had been puppet soldiers, some had been puppet police, and some had harbored bandits. Now they were still swaggering around and bullying the poor. I fought for eight years against the Japanese, but I couldn't even join the peasant association. Dissatisfied, I went to the district and county to sue them, accusing them of having bad backgrounds, accusing them of protecting landlords and rich peasants, and accusing them of embezzling fruits of the struggle. So, the village cadres all held a grudge against me!

Wei Jintang, the director of the militia committee, was a landlord who had been a puppet village chief. He was promoted to the district. They wanted to elect another director. The cadres arranged for Wei Jingwu to be "elected." This Wei Jingwu's grandfather was nicknamed Red Beard, a famous local bully. He had never worked since he was a child. Later, his family declined, and he went to Yang Lanzi to become a bandit. He was captured by the Eighth Route Army and spent less than half a year before escaping home to work as a puppet soldier under Gao Delin. He was captured by us again while attacking the company kiln. He was in the Third Column. When he returned from the hospital, he saw the struggle going on and didn't return to the army. I opposed him during the election, and his hatred for me was even greater.

In October of the year before last, the cadres kicked me out of the house, put a tall hat on me, and held a meeting to struggle against me, saying that I often went to the Japanese blockhouse and was a "spy." I said that delivering propaganda to the blockhouse was my revolutionary work. The cadres then led the crowd in shouting slogans: "Oppose the spy's sophistry!" When asking for opinions, the basic masses were silent, only the cadres Wei Jingyu and Wei Jingmei insisted that I was a spy, demanding that I reflect on who I had organized with. They forced me to ask for a Kuomintang certificate and a gun. I really didn't have one, so they said I wasn't being honest and beat me, almost killing me several times. I had no choice. My hair turned white with worry. I had to admit that I wanted to kill the cadres and kill everyone in the village. The cadres still didn't stop. They still held me back to reflect, treating me like a toy. They even expelled me from the party and returned my four months of party dues. The villagers only bailed me out for the New Year. After the New Year, the cadres arrested my son again, saying that Hua’s brother was a spy and had poisoned the high school he was studying at. He confessed that Wei Yongyan gave him the poison and also gave it to my son. My son didn't admit it, and they hung him from the beam. My son couldn't bear it and sneaked away that night. The cadres arrested me again. My son thought he couldn't escape, so he came back. If it hadn't been for a letter from the district head, he would have died long ago. I have three brothers, and he is the only son. My older brother is over sixty years old and has been single his whole life. They are all counting on this one person to carry on the family line. We knelt down and begged the cadres, begging everywhere to send us food. The village cadres just wouldn't let us go, and they wouldn't let my son confront Wei Hua's brother. Later, we had no choice but to release us, but they still withheld my demobilization certificate and wouldn't let me go to the county to collect grain. My son still wears a "spy leg" sign.

(III)

My opinion is very simple. If the village cadres say I'm a spy, then they should say why I'm a spy and show some evidence. If they expel me from the party, they should explain why and give a reason. If Wei Yongyan gave my son poison, when and where did he give it, and who saw it? The chairman of the peasant association, Qu Meixi, his wife took poison from him, what was he carrying the poison for? My son is a "spy leg," who is the spy head? They should also say. I worked as a hired laborer, carrying a clay pot, and I'm still poor and haven't turned over. Instead, they "kicked me out" and made me a spy. I fought for eight years in the war against Japan, unafraid of sacrifice. Sacrificing for the revolution is glorious. But if I die now, I will die too unjustly. I joined the Communist Party to seek light and find a way out. What did I really find? If I don't vent this grievance, I won't be able to close my eyes when I die.

Another opinion is, what should these village cadres be considered according to the new regulations? Are they qualified to be Communists? Some people were still feeding several mules a few years ago, all good land near the village. They just sold the mules and sold the land, and now they come to divide the fruits of the struggle, dividing more than anyone else. Is this the liberation of the poor or the liberation of the landlords? Doesn't the higher-level leadership inspect the work in Xisu Village?

There is also a point to raise to Guo Quan You (branch committee secretary), the political commissar Guo, he once said to me, "Look how badly they've treated you? Worse than a landlord!" He knew the situation clearly, but why didn't he do anything about it? When I returned after demobilization, why didn't he give me an organization letter? Why didn't he let me join the peasant association? Why did he let those cadres mess around in the village? I reported it, and you only said to "correct my thinking." Why didn't you do anything? Does Chairman Mao's policy allow you to lead like this?

    西苏地主分子诬赖农民是“特务”
    三辈长工竟被扫地出门
    贫雇魏殿花来本报申诉恳请调查
    农民们：
    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。
    魏殿花五十六岁，沙河三区西苏庄人，贫雇成份，是个共产党员又是个荣退军人。但是他和他儿子，都被坏村干“整”成了“特务”，打死打活的一直不放。后来群众把他保出来，坏村干还是不准他和人说话，不准他离开村子。并且威胁他说：“你如果跑到县上去告，你就不用再回西苏庄了。”阴历去年腊月底，他儿子到外村担柿子，碰见别人读报，读到武安南丛井徐更的申冤这一段，知道天大的冤曲也能申诉，便假装包东西把这张报要了，回家告诉父亲。魏殿花拿着这张报，偷跑出村，一路打听，终于找到报馆来了。他谈的时候，说说就哭得说不下去了。他怕坏村干见他一跑，又去吊打他的儿子，他要求政府替他作主，赶快派人去查处理。下面就是他诉的苦，本报同志代笔。
  （一）
    我家是三辈子给地主当觅汉（长工）的人家，爹和爷爷给地主受了一辈子。我四岁上爹就死了，家里十三口人，老的老，小的小，就一个叔叔能干活。人多地少顾不住，光绪二十六年闹灾荒，和叔叔分开了家。分家分了四亩地，娘和我们姊妹兄弟共五口，我是老二。八岁上家里没得吃，我就给人家放牛。开头每年挣一吊五百钱，后来两吊、三吊、挣到四吊。一直放牛做觅汉整整十年。
    十八岁上秋罢了，没得干糊不住嘴，就担起沙锅来，冬天拾砍，春天给地主当觅汉，干一年吃一年，一年下来一年完，做觅汉到了整四十。民国九年大歉年，那年自己和老婆孩子弟兄们逃荒，到了山西屯留玉皇山，在那里靠割柴生活。家里别人逃荒在外，只有娘一个人在家里，娘想望大家，又饥又孤，病上加气就死了。
    听说娘死了，把老婆孩子撇在山上，我当了一件棉衣做盘缠，星夜赶回来。到家想不到邻居四舍用席子卷住帮助埋啦！第二天赶紧就往回返。因为盘缠不够，耽误一天，就回不去，老婆孩子在山上就得挨饿。
    民国十年从山西回来，我姐姐男人死了，给姐姐找了个主，使了几个钱，买了三亩地，又租种了人家四、五亩地，我弟兄两个在外给人家当觅汉，一年年糠糠菜菜才算没饿死。
    事变了，八路军下来，我参加了抗日工作，在区当交通员。又参加了共产党。四二年灾荒来了，全家又逃荒到山西。我调到了敌工站送信，那时敌人修了三道封锁线，送信要穿过两道封锁线，过一道沙河。一次过沙河水大，几乎给冲走了。为了工作，敌人把我右眼给打坏啦！日本投降后，因为我上了年纪，上级号召复员，我要求退伍，上级批准我是二等残废就回家了。
  （二）
    我一回家，看到村干部尽是一伙地主富农，有的当过伪军，有的当过伪警察，有的窝藏过土匪，现在还是耀武扬威的欺侮穷光蛋。我八年抗战，反而连农会也参加不上，我不满意，就跑到区上县上去告，告他们成份不好，告他们包庇地主富农，告他们贪污果实。所以村干部都同我记上仇啦！
    武委会主任魏锦堂是个地主，当过伪乡长，提拔到区上去了，要另选主任。干部布置了一下，“选”上了魏景武，这魏景武祖父外号叫红胡子，是个有名的恶霸地主，他自小没劳动过，后来家里破落了，跑到杨兰子那里当土匪，被八路军俘虏了，混了不到半年，又逃回家到高德林那里当伪军。打公司窑又被咱们俘虏了，他在三纵队，从医院里回来，看见闹斗争，就不回部队了。选举时我反对他，他对我仇气更大。
    前年十月，干部把我扫地出门，戴上高帽子，开大会斗争我，说我常常上日本炮楼，是“特务”。我说上炮楼送宣传品是我的革命工作。干部就领导喊口号：“反对特务强辩！”提意见时基本群众都不吭，只有干部魏锦玉、魏锦梅死咬住我是特务，要我反省组织的谁？逼着向我要国民党证，要枪，我实在是没有，就说我不坦白，就吊、就打，弄死了好几回。我没有办法，把头发都愁白了，只好承认想杀干部，想杀全村的人。干部还不罢休，还扣着要我反省，把我当成一个玩物。把我党籍也开除了，还退给我四个月党费。过年了，乡亲们才把我保出来。过年以后，干部又把我儿子扣起来了。说花一个兄弟是特务，他在高小里念书，放了毒药了。供出魏永言给了他毒药，还给了我儿子。我儿子不承认，被他们吊在梁上，我儿子受不住，那晚上偷跑了，干部就把我又扣起来，我儿子跑出去一想跑不脱，又回来了。要不是区长有信来，早就没有命了。我弟兄三个，只这一个儿子。我哥哥六十多岁了，打了一辈子光棍，都指望这一个人传宗接代。跪来跪去向干部哀求，到处讨饭来送给俺爷们吃。村干部就是不放，也不让我儿子和魏花的兄弟对证。后来没办法了，才放我们出来，但是还扣着我的复员证，不让我到县上去领粮食。我儿子到现在也还挂着块“特务腿”的牌子。
  （三）
    我的意见很简单，村干部说我是特务，就叫他说说为啥是特务，拿出个证据来。开除我党籍，为啥要开除，也要讲出个条件来。说魏永言给了我儿子毒药，什么时候什么地方给的，谁看见了？农会主席曲梅喜，他老婆从他身上掏出了毒药，他带的毒药是干啥？我儿子是“特务腿”，特务头是谁？也要说一说。我当长工担沙锅，穷到现在没有翻过身来，反而把我“扫地出门”，整成了特务。我八年抗战，不怕牺牲，为革命，牺牲是光荣的，我现在死，却死得太屈。我到共产党是寻光明，是寻出路，我真寻到了什么？我不出这口冤气，死了也不能闭眼睛。
    再一条意见，是村干部这一伙人按新章程该算个啥？有没有资格当共产党？有的人前几年还喂着几条骡子，尽是近地好地，刚把骡子卖了，地卖了，又来分斗争果实，分得比谁都多，这该不该？魏合群家原来五十多亩地，一直没有斗，反而分了许多斗争果实，这到底是穷人翻身还是地主翻身？西苏庄的工作，上级就不检查检查？
    还有一条提给郭政委郭全有（分委书记），他曾给我说：“你看你让人家整得多惨？比地主还惨哩！”他明知道这情形，但他为啥不管？我复员回来，为啥不给我组织信？为啥不让我参加农会？为啥让那些干部在村上乱搞？我报告了，你光说要“纠正思想”，为啥都不处理？毛主席的政策，允许不允许你这样领导？
