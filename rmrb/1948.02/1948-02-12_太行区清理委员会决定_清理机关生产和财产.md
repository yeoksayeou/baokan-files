    Taihang District Clearing Committee Decides to
    Clear Up the Production and Property of Organs
    [Taihang News] The Taihang District Clearing Committee was formally established on January 10th. Comrade Lai Ruoyu is the chairman, Comrades Zhao Huilou and Li Yiqing are the vice-chairmen, and Comrades Zhou Guangtan, Wu Zuomin, Yang Wenwei, Ye Song, Song Guanying, and Fan Xinshan are the members. They are responsible for leading the clearing up of organ production and organ property in the entire district.
    [Taihang News] On the 6th of this month, the Taihang District Clearing Committee issued "Instructions on Clearing Up the Production and Property of Organs" to the clearing committees at all levels of local and military units in the entire district. The instructions first pointed out that the clearing up must be led by the top leaders, with each unit taking the lead in systematic clearing, and then concentrating and receiving by region and area. It is essential to avoid drastic price increases and decreases and to prevent the market from being greatly affected. It is necessary to prohibit the massive disposal of materials due to the ending of operations as much as possible. It is essential to prevent property from being lost. If there are any cases of corruption, waste, concealment, or favoritism, disciplinary actions should be taken according to the seriousness of the circumstances. Regarding the scope of the clearing, the instructions pointed out that the organ property and organ surpluses referred to by the Central Bureau and the District Party Committee should include the following four types: First, accumulated savings from previous years; second, the surplus from 1936; third, materials seized from the enemy and puppets during the war; and fourth, grain funds received in excess of the original number of personnel in the organs. The instructions stated that all production by various militias and the Armed Committees should be terminated, and all property confiscated by public security departments at all levels should be handed over to the public. The clearing methods stipulated that the border region and local grain funds used for organ production should not be returned privately, but must be reviewed and approved by the Clearing Committee. For larger amounts, a report should be made to the higher-level Clearing Committee. In order not to affect the market, during the clearing period, shops that are designated by the District Party Committee-level Clearing Committee as capable of implementing policies and having stronger cadres may continue to operate as before, while the rest must immediately cease operations. Production with supply tasks (such as family schools) must be managed by operators and reported to the District Party Committee-level Clearing Committee for approval. Some factories, coal mines, and hospitals that cannot stop operating should operate while clearing up. Once the clearing is completed, the Clearing Committee will send personnel to take over and directly lead (hospitals and cigarette factories will be accepted by the public, without transferring them to private individuals). In order to carry out the clearing in a planned, step-by-step, and systematic manner, it is necessary to convene meetings of the main responsible personnel of each production unit and the secretaries of each organ, to get these people thinking straight, discuss specific methods, inspire them to consciously carry out the clearing, and formulate plans, and announce strict discipline. Clearing committees at all levels should also organize inspection teams to conduct inspections. The clearing committees of the military system are responsible both to the higher-level clearing committees of the military system and to the clearing committees of the party committees at the same level, but when calculating property in the future, the military and local authorities must calculate separately and not mix them together.
    [Taihang News] On the 1st of this month, the Taihang Clearing Committee announced the "Measures for the Conclusion of the Clearing of Production by Organs at the District Administrative Office and Military Region Levels." The regulations stipulate: 1. All property of organ production units must be thoroughly investigated and registered, and handled separately. The fruits of struggle should be returned to the masses, and property obtained through abnormal operations or of unknown origin should be handed over to the public in full and not be distributed as dividends. 2. The invested shares and dividends of organs are not allowed to be withdrawn. Those withdrawn before December 26th of last year (i.e., the date of the conclusion of the meeting of all production units at the District Party Committee level) will be handled together during the clearing of organ property. Those withdrawn after the 26th are illegal and should be reported to the Clearing Committee for handling. Private shares and dividends, except for those of the targets of struggle who are not allowed to withdraw, must be certified by the head of the organ for staff members and by the village for the masses. 3. All debts should be cleared during the clearing period, but items should not be sold cheaply due to the urgency of clearing debts; long-term loans from organs are not allowed to be withdrawn temporarily and will be resolved together during the clearing of organ property. Temporary loans may be withdrawn after being reviewed by the head of the organ and approved by the Clearing Committee; bank loans should be repaid, but must be reviewed and approved by the head of the organ. 4. Losses and bad debts must be listed in detail, with the reasons explained, and approved by the Clearing Committee after being reviewed by the head of the organ. 5. For property valuation, commodities and raw materials should be valued according to the general market price and the distinction between popular and unpopular goods, either at face value, 90% of value, or 80% of value, and verified by the valuation organization designated by the Clearing Committee; operating equipment, furniture, and houses should not be valued, but should be handled at the original price or the price at the end of the last period; non-priced property should be registered and transferred. 6. Strict inspections must be carried out during the clearing, and the reasons must be thoroughly investigated if discrepancies are found between the actual objects and the accounts. During the clearing, except for the sale of some items necessary to repay external debts, no other business is allowed. During the clearing, the main responsible persons of each production unit are not allowed to be transferred. Those who are not related to the clearing and were sent by the original organ should be handled by the original organ in cooperation with the Clearing Committee. Hired personnel should be dismissed separately, and the targets of struggle should be sent back to their original places of origin along with all their shares, dividends, and bonuses to be handed over to the masses. The distribution of bonuses and dividends shall be in accordance with the original regulations of each unit, but regardless of whether the personnel are on the supply system or the salary system, the maximum amount per person per year shall not exceed 400 jin of rice or 60,000 yuan, while personnel without salary and without supply shall not exceed 1,200 jin of rice or 180,000 yuan per year, and the minimum shall be 600 jin of rice or 90,000 yuan. At the end of the clearing of each organ production unit, a report on the clearing situation shall be submitted to the Clearing Committee, and all property shall not be moved, but shall be sealed on the spot and taken over by the organ designated by the Clearing Committee. Factories (excluding cigarette factories), workshops, and horse-drawn carriage inns, etc., that are beneficial to economic construction and needed by the masses, may be transferred if local cooperative societies, the masses, or employees are willing to operate them, but must be approved by the Clearing Committee. All cadre cooperative societies must be terminated, and employee cooperative societies are not allowed to operate on the market, but only to supply their own employees internally. Finally, the measures stipulate that any concealment, corruption, waste, favoritism, etc., during the conclusion of the clearing of organ production, as well as the private transfer of property without the approval of the Clearing Committee, shall be deemed as corruption and punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing corruption promulgated by the Border Government.
