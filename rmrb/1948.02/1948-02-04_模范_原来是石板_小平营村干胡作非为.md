    【Jinan News】 In Linzhang's Xiaopingying, a village of over a hundred households, when the bell rang during mass movements, the masses would immediately rush to the meeting place. Those working in the fields would quickly return. Seeing how promptly everyone attended meetings, the district cadres considered the Farmers' Association Director, Kang Sanming, to be capable, saying that this village didn't need leadership and that Kang alone could complete the tasks. Last year, the turning-over team mobilized the masses in this village, calling Xiaopingying a model, the most thorough village in the entire Third District. They praised it at the district village cadre meetings, reported on it in the newspapers, and even wrote pamphlets to introduce its experiences to various places. Recently, from the mouths of poor and hired peasants, it was learned that this was not the case at all. The past claims of good work were all forced by Kang Sanming. His mother has a godson who is now a battalion commander in the bandit Guo Qing's gang. In the village, he calls himself "Old Liu Rong," looks down on the small district cadres, doesn't discuss matters with the cadres, let alone with the masses. The masses are all afraid of him. If anyone is late for a mass meeting, they have to kneel in the meeting place, and they can only stand up after the meeting is over, which is like wearing a tall hat and parading through the streets. They lead the militia, along with Zhao Shuanglin, a fleeing landlord living in their village (from Furen Village, Fourth District, Ci County), and a former puppet captain's guard called "Iron Bell," and went to "crack down on smuggling" more than a dozen times. They seized a lot of foreign cloth, foreign cigarettes, foreign iron, grain, cotton, and other things, which they all divided up among themselves. The Farmers' Association kept forty-five mu of land. Last spring, they gathered all the livestock in the village and plowed and cultivated the land first. When hoeing, the Farmers' Association, the militia, the Women's Association, and the children all had to go, and the cadres supervised the work from behind. After the grain was harvested, it was calculated as belonging to Kang Sanming, Hei Bao, and three others, divided equally, and they even made the poor who had been allocated land pay public grain. The masses said: "Without lifting a finger, they divide the grain to their homes, which is even worse than the landlords!" The masses struggled against Zhang Zishou for six mu of good well-watered land, and the group discussion gave it to the three families of military dependents of Yang Wenzhong. Kang Sanming said: "If you don't discuss according to policy, the meeting won't end in three days." The masses immediately understood what he meant and said: "Director Kang, we've discussed it, is it okay to give you two mu and village deputy Hei Bao four mu?" Kang Sanming said: "Isn't that right! Meeting adjourned." In the summer, they detained the landlords and confiscated their belongings, only dividing the fruits without struggling against the landlords, which made the masses very dissatisfied. Last year, when dividing the fruits, the eight village cadre "activists" picked all the good things, leaving the broken ones for the masses to grab, and some poor people didn't get anything at all. This year, when dividing the fruits, they wrapped good clothes and cloth with broken hides, and wrapped good hides with broken things, assessed the price, and divided 4,000 yuan per share regardless of rich or poor. The cadres took them first, and only took the broken bundles, which cheated the masses again. Kang Sanming shouted on the street while beating a gong: "No one can farm for the landlords and be a running dog." But he ate with the landlord Zhang Mingxin and even lent him four or five shi of grain. They ate the landlord's chickens and even ate the masses' chickens. With such a large tombstone weighing on the masses, let alone turning over to become masters, no one dared to speak out about suffering and grievances. Everyone hopes to kick away this stone and turn over as soon as possible.

    “模范”原来是石板
    小平营村干胡作非为
    【冀南消息】临漳小平营，一百多户人家，在群众运动的时候，把钟一打，群众就立时到会场，在地里做活的，也就赶快往回走。区干部见开会来的很齐，认为农会主任康三明能干，说这个村不用领导，光靠康主任就能完成任务。去年翻身队在这村发动群众，说小平营是典型，是全三区最彻底的村，在全区村干会上表扬，报上也表扬，还写小册子向各地方介绍经验。最近从贫雇农民口中了解，完全不是这么回事。过去说工作好，都是康三明强迫的。他娘有个干儿，现在土匪郭青里头当营长，他在村里自称“老刘荣”，看不起区里小干部，有事不和干部商量，更不和群众商量，群众都怕他。一开群众会，谁要到的晚了，就得跪到会场，多会开完会多会叫起来，不就是戴高帽子游街。他们领着民兵，还有一个住在他村的逃亡地主赵双林（磁县四区附任村人），还有一个伪队长护兵叫“铁钟”，带着枪去“缉私”有十几回，查的洋布、洋烟、洋铁、粮食、棉花等东西很多，他们都分了。农会留下四十五亩地，去年春天，把全村牲口都集合起来，先犁先耕。锄地时，农会、民兵、妇会、儿童都得去，干部们都在后边监工。收下粮食来，算成了康三明、黑保他们五个人的，按对半分，还叫分地穷人拿公粮，群众说：“不动手就把粮食分到家，这比地主还厉害呀！”群众斗争出张自受六亩水车井好地，小组讨论给了杨文仲他们三家军属，康三明说：“您不按政策讨论，三天也不能散会。”群众一看就明白了他的意思，就说：“康主任，我们讨论好了，给你二亩，给村副黑保四亩行吗？”康三明说：“这不对啦吗！散会吧。”夏天，把地主扣起来没收了东西，光分果实不斗地主，群众很不满。去年分果实，八个村干“积极分子”把好东西都拣了，剩下破的叫群众抢，有的穷人没抢到半点。今年分果实，把好衣服布匹包坏皮，坏东西包好皮，评上价，不分穷富每一股四千元，干部先拿，光拿破包袱皮的，又把群众坑的不轻。康三明在街上打着锣喊：“谁也不能给地主种地当狗腿。”他却给地主张明新伙吃饭，还借给他四五石粮食，他们吃了地主的鸡，连群众的鸡也吃了。群众身上压着这样一块大石板，别说翻身当家，受苦受气谁也不敢讲，大家盼着踢开这块石头早早翻身。
