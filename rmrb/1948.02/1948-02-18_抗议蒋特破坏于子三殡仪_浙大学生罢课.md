Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: A delayed dispatch from Hangzhou: The entire student body of Zhejiang University has been on strike for three days since the 5th of last month to protest Chiang Kai-shek's special agents sabotaging the funeral of Comrade Yu Zisan, chairman of the university's student union, and the violent act of beating students of the university. The students of the university originally planned to hold a funeral for Comrade Yu on January 4th. On the morning of that day, the university was blocked off on all sides with barbed wire, tables, chairs, and other objects by Chiang's bandits, and surrounded by a large number of Chiang's bandit military police armed with bayonets, American-style machine guns, and water cannons. When the students gathered to discuss countermeasures, Chiang's special agents, who were lying in ambush, swarmed in with clubs and beat more than 20 students (previous reports by foreign news agencies mistakenly reported eight), three of whom had their heads broken. A female student was knocked down by a wooden stick and then surrounded and beaten, breaking two tendons and falling unconscious. When Chiang's special agents committed the atrocities, the unarmed students bravely resisted and captured eight Chiang's special agents on the spot. A "Commemorative Badge for Graduation from the Fifth Class of the Sino-(Chiang) American Cooperative Training Class" was found on one of them. To protest this atrocity, the students decided to strike for three days and decided to hold a clothing and hat burial for Comrade Yu on campus.
