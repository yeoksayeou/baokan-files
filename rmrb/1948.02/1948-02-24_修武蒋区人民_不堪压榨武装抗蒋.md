　　People in the Jiang Area of Xiuwu County
　　Unable to Bear Oppression, Take Up Arms to Resist Jiang
　　[Our Newspaper’s News] In the En Village area of Xin’an Township, Xiuwu County, within the Jiang bandit-controlled area, the burden for one mu of land last year was more than one shi of grain and over 200,000 Jiang currency. In addition to this, there were expenses for fodder and the puppet self-defense corps, security office, etc. This January, 2.7 dou of grain and 20,000 currency have already been levied per mu, leaving the common people destitute and suffering. With such a heavy burden, even if they hand over everything, it's not enough. How can the common people afford it? Many lock their doors during the day to avoid the corvee. When the Bao and Jia heads fail to collect enough grain and money, the township office detains them. A few Bao and Jia heads who weren't detained, because of the intense pressure, sought death by hanging themselves. Four Jia heads in Nanlezhuang hanged themselves, one died, and three were rescued. One Jia head in Chouhuazhuang also hanged himself. The fifth Jia head of En Village also hanged himself and died. In addition, several families were driven to jump into wells. Irregular troops constantly urged for grain and money. If they couldn't pay, they would beat and rob. As the New Year approached, the robbing became even more severe. On the 4th of this month, the bandit troops of Wang Fengyin, the puppet Bo’ai County Security Regiment, and Ma Qingnian, the puppet self-defense captain of Zaodian (enemy area), robbed grain and steamed buns in villages such as Zaodian and Shilin, taking whatever they could find. They robbed twenty-three sheep from the people of Zaodian. Shi Zhidubo of the puppet Fourth Special District Security Regiment sent three plainclothes agents to Jiahetun Village (enemy area) to rob grain. Driven to desperation, the villagers beat these grain collectors, injuring one of them. Nineteen soldiers of the enemy's regular 38th Division came to this village to rob grain, but the villagers pretended to be the Eighth Route Army and scared them away.

　　[Taihang News] According to someone who escaped from Yuci City, under the control of the Yan bandits, in the middle of this month: Goods are scarce in Yuci City, Jiang currency is worthless, and prices are exceptionally high. Millet costs as much as 550,000 yuan per dou, equivalent to 40,000 yuan per jin; wheat flour is 52,000 yuan per jin; sorghum flour is 25,000 yuan per jin; black bean cake is 2,000 yuan per jin; bran is 4,000 yuan per jin; a half-liang (1.75 oz) sesame cake is 5,000 yuan; peanuts cost as much as 45,000 yuan per jin; black cotton cloth is 50,000 yuan per chi (foot). Common people and small merchants are secretly saying through tears: "There's nothing to eat, and they still keep demanding grain and money. If things continue like this, we'll either be forced to death, starve to death, or have to flee to survive."

    【太行消息】据本月中旬从阎匪统治下的榆次城跑出来的某人谈：榆次城货物稀少，蒋币不值钱，物价异常昂贵，小米每斗竟达五十五万元，一斤合四万元；白面一斤五万二千元；高粱面一斤二万五千元；黑豆饼一斤两千元；谷糠一斤四千元；一两半重的烧饼一个五千元；花生一斤竟达四万五千元；黑洋布一尺五万元。老百姓、小商人都含泪偷偷的说：“没吃的，人家天天还催要粮款。象这样下去，不是逼死，就是饿死，要不，只有外逃求生。”
