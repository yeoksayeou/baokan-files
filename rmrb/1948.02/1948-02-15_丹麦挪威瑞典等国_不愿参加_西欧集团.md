Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: Comprehensive reports: Bevin's plot to organize a "Western European Bloc" under the orders of the United States has begun to encounter obstacles. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 7th, diplomatic observers stated that the reaction of Western European countries "threatens to destroy the British Foreign Secretary's plan for a Western European alliance." It is understood that Denmark and Sweden have adopted a consistent stance against Scandinavian countries participating in the Bevin group. Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft declared on January 30th: "Denmark must not be placed in an Eastern or Western bloc, and we are unwilling to sell Greenland." Norwegian figures in London stated on the 7th that Norway will also issue a similar statement, refusing to recognize any proposals that bind the country. The Scandinavian countries unanimously believe that Bevin's attempt is aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and taking a step closer to war. Even Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, which Bevin considered to be able to form an "important core of Western Europe," have adopted a reserved attitude towards Bevin's "Western European Bloc" plan, demanding equal say with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the issue of western Germany first. In British public opinion, voices opposing Bevin's conspiracy are also heard everywhere. On the 6th, at a Labour Party meeting in London and a meeting of the Labour Socialist League at Cambridge University, Zilliacus stated that Bevin, like Churchill, is a warmonger. Bevin's foreign policy has failed on all fundamental issues.

    丹麦挪威瑞典等国
    不愿参加“西欧集团”
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：贝文在美国命令下组织“西欧集团”的阴谋已开始碰壁。据合众社七日电传伦敦外交观察家称：西洲各国反应“势将摧毁英外相之西欧联盟计划。”据悉，丹麦与瑞典采取一致立场，反对斯堪的纳维亚各国参加贝文集团。丹麦总理赫多夫上月三十日宣称：“丹麦不得被放在一个东方或西方集团之内，我们不愿出卖格陵兰”。伦敦的挪威人士七日称：挪威亦将发表同样声明，不承认任何约束该国的建议。斯堪的纳维亚各国一致认为，贝文之企图在于反对苏联，而且走近战争一步。甚至被贝文认为可与之建立成“西欧之重要核心”的比、荷、卢三国，亦对贝文“西欧集团”计划采取保留态度，而要求在西部德国问题上首先与英美法三国有相等的发言权。在英国舆论界中，反对贝文阴谋之声，亦随处可闻。六日，在伦敦工党会议及剑桥大学的劳工社会主义者联谊会上，齐里亚库斯称：贝文与邱吉尔一样，都是战争贩子。贝文外交政策，在一切基本问题上，都已经失败了。
