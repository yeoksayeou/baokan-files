Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—Chiang Kai-shek bandits are already engaged in the sinister trade of exporting iron ore to support Japan's "economic revival." According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Central News Agency on the 16th, the first shipment of 8,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan arrived last week at Yawata, Japan's largest steel center, aboard the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Haiti" freighter. It also admitted that these 8,000 tons of iron ore were part of the 250,000 tons of iron ore sold by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Resources Committee to Japan through a British company. When the iron ore arrived in Yawata, the local Japanese bandit authorities held a "formal celebration ceremony" because this iron ore would greatly increase their steel production. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the same agency on January 24th, the US imperialists and Japanese bandits are planning for Japan to produce 3.5 million tons of steel ingots and 2 million tons of pig iron annually.

　　蒋匪与日进行罪恶买卖
  　接济日寇大量铁苗
    【新华社陕北二十日电】蒋匪输出铁苗以支持日本“经济复兴”之罪恶交易已在进行中。据十六日蒋匪中央社东京电供称：第一批由海南岛运日之铁苗八千吨，上周已由蒋匪的“海地”号轮船运抵日本最大钢铁中心八幡。并供认：此八千吨铁苗，系蒋匪资源委员会经由英国公司卖给日本的二十五万吨铁苗中的一部分。铁苗到达八幡时，当地日寇当局曾举行“正式庆祝仪式”，因此项铁苗将大大增加他们的钢业产量。另据该社上月二十四日东京电透露：美帝与日寇正计划日本每年生产钢块三百五十万吨、生铁二百万吨。
