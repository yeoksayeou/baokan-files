　　Border Region People Sincerely Support the Land Law
　　Poor and Landless Peasants Actively Refute Others' Distortions of the Land Law, Leading Everyone to Follow the Bright Road Pointed Out by Chairman Mao.
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, it was warmly supported by the people of the entire region. Everyone said, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao's method is truly brilliant." They are willing to resolutely implement the equal distribution of land and conscientiously reorganize the ranks.

    Poor and landless peasants from Wanggou and other mountain villages along Zuoquan Road traveled long distances to listen to lectures on the Land Law in the main village of Gaojiajing, and they also participated enthusiastically in discussions. Zhang Fulin, a poor peasant from Maquan Mountain Village, said: "In the past, the local despots and landlords exploited us so much that we couldn't afford to eat or wear clothes. When we had something to do and came to Gaojiajing, did anyone look up to us, young or old? Now, when we come to Gaojiajing, people shout from afar: 'Old Zhang is here!' Today, listening to the Land Law, it says that we poor people will be in power. This is really the first time since I was born." Hu Sanrong and Liu Fuheng, poor peasants from Nanyucun Village in Xiyang, said: "This is great, the land will be distributed fairly. There are few landlords in our village, and after struggling for some land, the cadres got all the good land and the land closest to the village. We didn't dare to voice our opinions, and they (other people) wouldn't give us anything good either. This time, we can also get a share of the land; this is how everyone can truly have food to eat and land to cultivate." An Qicheng from Sanpang Village in Linzhang said: "The north and east of our village are all good land, while the south and west are all sandy land. I have seven or eight mu of southwest land, and after the distribution, I still have southwest land; the grain I harvest is not enough to eat. This new method has really saved my life."

    Some poor and landless peasants in some places believe that "the Land Law is good, but I'm afraid it can't be done." They mostly think from past experiences. For example, poor and landless peasants from Donghu Village in Shahe said, "In the past, it was just talk that poor and landless peasants were the backbone, it was a false name. When it came to loans, the poor and landless didn't get a single cent." Poor peasants from Xihu Village also said: "In the past movements, cadres only said that poor peasants should take the lead, but when it came to distributing the fruits, they wouldn't let the poor peasants manage it. When cadres distributed the fruits, they wanted the masses to support them, so they proposed: 'Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water.' As a result, they supported sixteen cypress trees. The masses were left with an empty name of liberation." After publicizing the Land Law, these people understood the great principle of the poor and landless being masters of their own affairs, and realized that they must truly rise up and work hard this time.

    Some poor and landless peasants also had some doubts about giving landlords and family members of KMT officers living in the countryside a share of land, some because the landlords had not been thoroughly struggled against. For example, Li Guifu from Ziping Village in Xiyang said: "Even if you give the landlord a share, it's okay, the landlord in our village hasn't been defeated, he eats better and dresses warmer than our liberated peasants, I don't agree that he should share the land with the peasants." Some people couldn't figure it out either. For example, Yan Shuangqing from Xiguxian Village in Changzhi said: "I don't agree to giving the landlord land to cultivate, isn't that the same as giving back the fruits of our labor?" Cao Quantai said: "The Kuomintang officers are fighting with us, they are our enemies, I don't agree that we should give them land to cultivate." After publicizing the Land Law, everyone understood the reasoning. Yuan Songshan from Xiguxian Village said: "I agree with the idea of distributing land to the families of Kuomintang officers. If we give them land to cultivate, and they know about it, they might lay down their weapons and come back, and our victory can come sooner." Li Sanwang said: "The landlord must also get a share; as it stands now, the landlord has nothing, and we have to provide him with food and clothing. If we don't give him land to cultivate and we don't let him work anymore, he will starve to death, which will ruin our liberated area's policy, and it won't be beneficial to our peasants." They unanimously agreed that as long as the landlord's land and property are completely confiscated, and he bows his head politically, he should be given a share.

　　边区人民真心拥护土地法
　　贫雇农积极打破别人对土地法的曲解，领上大家走毛主席指给的光明大道。
    【本报消息】土地法大纲公布后，获得全区人民热烈拥护。大家都说："共产党毛主席的办法真是英明。"愿意坚决把平分土地整编队伍认真做好。
    左权路王沟等山庄的贫雇农，跑很远路到主村高家井听讲土地法，讨论时也很热心。马圈山庄贫农张福林说："过去恶霸地主剥削的俺吃不上穿不上，有事来高家井，大小孩谁看起咱？这时候来高家井，远远地就有人喊：'老张来啦！'今天听土地法叫咱穷人掌权，这真是娘生以来头一次。"昔阳南榆村贫雇胡三荣、刘富恒说："这可好，土地要分得公平了。咱村地主少，斗争些地，把好地近地都叫干部分啦。咱不敢提意见，伢（人家）也不给咱分好东西。这次咱也能分到一份地；这才真能人人有饭吃，人人有地种。"临漳三庞村安其成说："俺村村北村东都是好地，村南村西都是沙地。我有七、八亩西南地，分了二十亩还是西南地；打的粮食不够吃，这个新办法真救了我的命啦。"
    还有些地方贫雇认为："土地法好是好，就是怕办不到。"他们多是从过去的经验想的。如沙河东户村贫雇农说"过去光说贫雇当骨干，那是个假名，贷款时贫雇一个钱也没使上。"西户村贫雇也说："过去运动中干部光说贫雇带头，可是分果实就不让贫雇管了。干部分果实时想叫群众拥护，就提出：吃水不忘掏井人。结果拥护了十六棵柏树。群众落了个翻身空名。"这些人经过宣传土地法，懂得了贫雇当家的大道理，认识到他们这次要真正起来好好干。
    还有些贫雇农对于给地主和住在乡村的蒋军官兵家属分一份有些怀疑，有的是因为地主没斗透。如昔阳紫坪村李贵福说："就是分给地主一份也可以，咱村地主没斗垮，比咱翻身农民还吃得好穿得暖，我不同意农民分地他也分。"也有些人想不通。如长治西故县村阎双庆说："给地主分地种，我不同意，这不等于倒果实吗？"曹全太说："国民党军官和咱打，是咱仇人，咱再给他地种，我不同意。"经过宣传土地法，大家想清楚了道理。西故县村原松山说："分给国民党官兵家庭地种，我同意这一意见。咱把地给他种，他知道了，可以放下武器回来，咱们的胜利可以早点。"李三旺说："地主也要分一份才行；以现在说，地主啥也没有，吃穿都得咱给他。要是不分给他地种，咱再不叫他做活，就要饿死，坏了咱解放区的政策，对咱农民也没利。"他们一致认为只要地主土地财产全部没收了，政治上低头了应该分他一份。
