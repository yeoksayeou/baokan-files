    Landlord's Reckoning Enrages Farmers
    Problem Should Be Solved in Pingding
    [Pingding News] After the promulgation of the Land Law, a landlord surnamed Ye in Xihui, District Eight, went to Zhao Jiadang’s village and presented a false account to Zhao Qiangtang, a new middle peasant. Ye claimed that he had helped Zhao Qiangtang's family repair their kiln, and that the Zhao family owed him ten silver dollars in wages, which Zhao Qiangtang's mother had handled (Zhao's mother was already dead). As a result, he forcefully took one *shi* of rice (totaling two *shi* and five *dou* of rice) and carried away a plow. Zhao Qiangtang only had that bit of grain. He was already ill, and this incident enraged him so much that he died. He left behind an old man and two children, with no means of livelihood. We believe that such malicious landlords should be immediately investigated and dealt with according to the law, and the livelihood of Zhao Qiangtang's family should be seriously addressed.

    地主倒算气死农民
    平定应注意解决这个问题
    【平定消息】土地法公布后，八区西回一个姓叶的地主到赵家庄，向新中农赵千堂算了一笔黑帐。叶借口说给赵千堂家修过窑，赵家短他工资银洋十元，是赵千堂的妈经手办的（赵妈已死），结果硬算走一石米（共算下二石五斗米），还背走一张犁。但赵千堂就这一点粮食，他本来有病，这一下气愤不过，就气死了。留下一个老汉，两个小孩，生活没有路着。我们认为这样的恶毒地主，应立即注意起来，听候法办，并认真解决安置赵千堂的家属生活。
