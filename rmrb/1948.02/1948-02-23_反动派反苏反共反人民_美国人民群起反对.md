Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Reports from various sources: The American people continue to oppose the reactionary anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic actions. More than one hundred people, including famous American scientists, pastors, and artists, issued a joint statement on the 13th, demanding that "20th Century Fox" film studio should not release the anti-Soviet film "The Iron Curtain," accusing this film of violating the United Nations' resolution against war propaganda. The "American Foreign Born Protection Committee" issued a statement on the 15th, opposing the American reactionary authorities' continued arrest of William Z. Foster, one of the leaders of the American Communist Party, and Smith, secretary of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America. On the 12th, the liberal writer Hayes publicly criticized in the House Un-American Activities Committee that all forms of anti-communist legislation are "not allowing the free expression of political opinions" and "harming the people." Hayes satirically said: These legislations "represent the fascist measures of Hitler and Mussolini. Hitler and Mussolini first created a fear of spies, and then strangled the people's freedom." On the 17th, American newspapers published a letter to House Speaker Martin, signed by 129 members of the "National Literary and Art Research Association," including historian Bessie and novelist Lewis, strongly condemning the Un-American Activities Committee for endangering the basic rights of the American people.
