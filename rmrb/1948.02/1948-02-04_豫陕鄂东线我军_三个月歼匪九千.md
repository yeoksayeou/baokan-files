    Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 2nd: Frontline reporters report: Over the past three months, the Eastern Front Liberation Army, in conjunction with local armed forces in the 3rd and 5th Military Sub-districts, has actively suppressed Chiang Kai-shek's local bandit teams, landlord armed forces, and bandits along the Yi River and Ru River areas. As of the end of January, a total of 9,083 bandits and diehards have been annihilated in 74 battles, with the capture of 7 mortars, 86 light and heavy machine guns, and 5,574 long and short guns. The three puppet security regiments of Song County, Baofeng, and Xiangcheng, as well as Xia Dian in Linru and Shangdian in Yiyang, two notorious bandit gangs, have been completely annihilated in successive battles. The puppet security regiments of Lushan, Yiyang, and Yuxian have also been largely annihilated. Ping Wenzheng, the puppet commander of Yuxian, Dengfeng, and Linru counties, and many other bandit leaders, including the puppet regiment commander of Baofeng, have been killed in battle. The long-term lairs of the bandits and diehards, such as Daying, Zhaobao, Tianhu, and Minggao, have been successively eliminated by us. In the early stage of the suppression, the bandits and diehards stubbornly resisted, relying on the stockades they had built. After being severely damaged by us, they mostly resorted to fleeing at the first sign of trouble. However, under the combined attack of our armed suppression, disintegration and winning over, and mobilizing the masses to capture bandit leaders and search for guns, they still could not escape the fate of being annihilated. After being forced into banditry, the peasants, after understanding the Liberation Army's policies of distributing land and grain, were mostly unwilling to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek's landlords. As soon as they came into contact with our army, they laid down their weapons. The ratio of bandits killed and wounded to those captured alive in battle was 1:2.3 in the early period of November last year, and it has now changed to 1:11 in January of this year. The masses, who had long suffered from bandit harassment, fought extremely hard for our annihilation of the bandits. When we killed Ping Wenzheng and captured Xia Dian, an old woman with white hair came from more than ten miles away to beat Ping's corpse with her crutch, avenging her three sons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 2nd: The Second Military Sub-district Command of Southern Shaanxi announced the results of guerrilla warfare for the two months from November last year to the beginning of this month: A total of 17 battles were fought, annihilating 140 Chiang Kai-shek's Hu bandits, including 87 enemy officers below battalion commander killed and 57 captured alive. The captured items included 2 light machine guns, 189 long and short guns, 5,711 rounds of ammunition, 41 bombs, 1 telephone, more than 2,300 kilograms of electric wire, 6 horses, and the destruction of 11 bunkers and 1 bridge.

    豫陕鄂东线我军
    三个月歼匪九千
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】前线记者报导：东线解放军结合三、五分区地方武装，三个月来在伊河、汝河沿岸地区积极清剿蒋匪地方团队、地主武装及股匪等。至一月底止，在七十四次战斗中，共歼灭匪顽九千零八十三名，缴获迫击炮七门、轻重机枪八十六挺、长短枪五千五百七十四支。嵩县、宝丰、襄城等三个伪保安团及临汝夏店，伊阳上店两股著名匪顽在历次战斗中已被全部歼灭。鲁山、伊阳、禹县等伪保安团亦大部被歼。禹县、登封、临汝三县蒋伪司令平文正及宝丰伪团长等匪首多人均被击毙。匪顽盘踞多年的老巢大营、赵堡、田湖、鸣皋等地经我先后拔除。在清剿初期匪顽皆凭所修寨团固守顽抗，经予重创后，又多改用闻风即逃办法。但在我武装清剿，瓦解争取，及发动群众捕捉匪首、搜缴枪支结合打击下，仍难逃脱被歼命运。被迫为匪的农民认识了解放军分田分粮等政策后，多不愿再给蒋匪地主当炮灰，一与我军接触即放下武器。战斗中匪被毙伤与生俘的比例，在去年十一月初期为一比二点三，今年一月已变为一比十一。久苦于匪顽骚扰的群众对我歼灭匪顽异常奋斗。当我击毙平文正、攻占夏店后，一个白发苍苍的老太太从十多里外赶来用拐仗痛击平匪尸体，替她的三个儿子报仇雪恨。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】陕南二分区司令部公布去年十一月至本月初两个月游击战果如下：共作战十七次，歼蒋胡土顽一百四十名、内击毙敌营长以下八十七名、生俘五十七名。缴获轻机枪二挺、长短枪一百八十九支、子弹五千七百一十一发、炸弹四十一枚、电话机一部、电线二千三百余斤、马六匹、破坏碉堡十一座、桥梁一座。
