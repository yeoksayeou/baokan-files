    Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 20th: The Anhui West People's Liberation Army and military region troops are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and are launching a movement to examine class standing and ideology, conducting criticism and self-criticism. In the study, they are examining their understanding of the situation and investigating policies, discipline, work, style, and economy to dig out the ideological roots. In the study process, they are also constantly checking their learning attitude, with leading cadres setting an example. Implementing the spirit of democracy under centralized leadership, after a month of study, most cadres are beginning to realize that past shortcomings and errors are manifestations of impure composition, impure ideology, and unstable stand. After studying, the fighters have also further recognized the essence of the People's Liberation Army and strengthened their hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. During the Tengyun Temple battle, no soldier fell behind during the long-distance march in the mountains, and the battle task was completed. There has also been improvement in mass discipline, with everyone actively participating in mass work and strictly preventing any behavior that undermines mass discipline.

    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十日电】皖西人民解放军及军区部队认真学习毛主席的"目前形势和我们的任务"，并展开查阶级、查思想运动，进行批评与自我批评，在学习中从检查对形势的认识和查政策、查纪律、查工作、查作风、查经济等方面来挖掘思想根源。在学习过程中并随时检查学习态度，领导干部以身作则。贯彻了集中领导下的民主精神，经过一个月的学习，多数干部开始认识到过去的缺点和错误都是成份不纯，思想不纯和立场不稳的表现。战斗员经过学习后，也进一步认识了人民解放军的本质，加强了对蒋贼的仇恨。某部在腾云庙战斗时，在山地长距离急行军中没有一个战士掉队，完成了战斗任务。群众纪律方面也有了改善，人人都积极的参加群众工作，并严防破坏群众纪律的行为。
