Combining Land Law Propaganda
　Seize the Time to Prepare for Spring Planting
　Neiqiu County Government Instructs Districts and Villages to Act Immediately
[Neiqiu News] The Awakening of Insects is approaching, and soon it will be time to cultivate seeds and work the land. This year's spring is short, so we must seize the time for cultivating seeds and preparing the land. Manure should be delivered early, and the land should be harrowed early, otherwise, there will be trouble with cultivating seeds and dividing the land later on. If we encounter a timely rain, production will be delayed. In the past, people would start hauling manure to the fields and harrowing the land right after the fifth day of the first lunar month, but now most of them haven't moved. After inspection and research, it was found that several confused ideas are hindering the spring plowing preparation movement. Some upper-middle peasants have heard that excess land will be taken out, and they are calculating how much will be taken from them and which piece. They are afraid that if they harrow the land or deliver manure to the fields, it will be taken away later. Poor peasants know that they are only relying on the land they will receive, and they are planning to exchange it for better land in the future. They don't want to start early, fearing that the manure will be taken away during the exchange. Cadres who have been overturned too much are also afraid that the manure will be taken away when land is redistributed. The reason for these phenomena is mainly that the propaganda of the Land Law is not in-depth enough, and they have not truly grasped the spirit of the Land Law. The county leadership has issued an urgent instruction to all districts and villages to combine the study and propaganda of the Land Law Outline, continue production, and seize the time to carry out spring plowing preparation work:

　　(1) Thoroughly Implement the Study and Propaganda of the Land Law Outline
　District and village schools should start classes earlier and adhere to the study system. All important documents related to the Land Law should be discussed after being read and explained, and questions should be raised for everyone to discuss. Poor and hired peasants should become the backbone of the Land Law propaganda, and the policies on each class, especially the middle peasants, should be explained clearly during the land distribution. In the past, women spent a lot of time on spinning and weaving, so their study of the Land Law Outline was very poor. Some women didn't even know what it was all about, which is a major shortcoming. In the future, it should be combined with spinning and weaving to mobilize study and discussion. In the past, the propaganda of the Land Law was very uneven in various villages. Now, attention should be paid to villages where study is insufficient, and efforts must be made to ensure that every mass studies the Land Law Outline well. In terms of propaganda methods, the use of various market days to organize strong cadres to explain has yielded great results in the past, and this method can continue to be used. New methods should also be created. Those who faithfully abide by and maintain the Land Law Outline, focus on production, and patiently promote and persuade others to implement it should be commended in civil schools, radio stations, and public blackboards. Those who deliberately distort and sabotage, and are stubbornly unrepentant, should be strictly stopped or sent to the government. Do not carry out struggles, beatings, or detentions in the village.

　　(2) Seize the Time, Continue to Intensify Sideline Production, Implement Thrift to Overcome the Famine, and Prepare for Spring Planting.
　When publicizing the Land Law Outline, explain to the poor and hired peasants that implementing the Land Law is most beneficial to them, and that they will be the leading backbone in the future implementation of the distribution. They should also play a key role in promoting production and unite with the middle peasants to work hard. Explain to the middle peasants that implementing the Land Law is also beneficial to them and that they should focus on production. As long as they thoroughly study the Land Law, they will actively engage in production. For example, in Xiaoxinwang, the middle peasants were very scared in the past. After the old lunar year, the middle and poor peasants united to discuss and study, understood the basic spirit of the Land Law, and after the sixth day of the first lunar month, everyone helped each other, organized more than 20 livestock, and have now completely plowed and harrowed more than 700 mu of spring land. They are still seizing the time for production. This year's spring is short, and the work of cultivating seeds and working the land should start now. Now is a good time, and the sunny slopes have begun to thaw. If we do not seize the time to accumulate manure, deliver manure, and harrow the land, spring planting will be delayed. Sideline production should also be started immediately. Use the profits from the first hundred days of spinning and weaving to mobilize women and immediately restore the past organization and take action. In addition to not delaying spring plowing preparation, men should also be organized in a planned way according to the favorable conditions of each village. It should also be explained to the masses that if production, thrift, and spring plowing preparation work are not done well, the difficulties in life will be aggravated, which will be detrimental to the future land distribution. They should be made aware that the distribution is precisely for the purpose of improving production. The land cultivated on behalf of others should be distributed quickly, as this year's spring is very short and the cultivation of seeds for military families cannot be delayed. The examination and transfer of loans should continue to be carried out in depth. Those who have not transferred should continue to transfer. After the poor and hired peasants receive the loans, efforts should be made to organize them to unite with the middle peasants for production. This year, during the old lunar year, the broad masses of cadres and people accepted the government's instructions before the year, did not buy or sell firecrackers, and rarely bought useless things, and ate less meat, which has saved a lot of money. The spring famine has not yet passed, and the masses should continue to be mobilized to carry forward the past spirit of thrift to overcome the famine, save money and materials, and solve the problem of the spring famine.

　　结合宣传土地法
  　抓紧时间准备春耕
  　内邱县府指示区村立时进行
    【内邱消息】惊蛰将到，很快就要养种园地了。今年春短，闹养种必须抓紧，粪要早送，地要早耙，不然将来要闹养种，又要平分土地，遇见抢晌雨，就要误生产。过去一过正月初五就有人往地里拉粪，打耙地，现在却大部未动。经过检查研究，发现有几种糊涂思想阻碍着春耕准备运动。有些上中农听说要抽出多余部分土地，自己盘算不知道要抽自己多少，和抽那一块，怕打耙了地或把粪送到地里，将来给抽走了。贫农知道自己净赖地，打算将来换些好地，也不想早动手，怕抽换时带走自己的粪。翻身过高的干部，也怕抽肥时带走自己的粪。造成这些现象的原因，主要是对土地法宣传尚不深入，他们还没有真正掌握土地法的精神。县领导上特紧急指示各区村，结合学习宣传土地法大纲，继续生产，抓紧时间进行春耕准备工作：
    　　　　（一）贯彻深入学习宣传土地法大纲
    各区村民校要早些开课，坚持学习制度，把有关土地法的一切重要文件，经过读解后，提出问题让大家讨论，要使贫雇成为宣传土地法的骨干，把平分中对各阶级特别是中农政策说明白。妇女过去因纺织占的时间多，对土地法大纲学习的还很差，有的妇女根本还不知道是怎么一会事，这是一个大缺点，今后要和纺织结合，发动学习讨论。过去一段，各村宣传土地法很不平衡，现在要注意学习不够的村庄，一定要作到使每个群众普遍学习好土地法大纲。在宣传方式上，过去一段利用各集市，组织有力干部人员来讲解，收到成绩很大，这一方式还可继续采用。并应创造新的方法方式。对忠诚遵行维护土地法大纲，安心生产，并耐心给别人宣传，劝告别人执行的人。要在民校、广播台、大众黑板上进行表扬。对故意曲解破坏执迷不悟的分子，应严厉制止，或送政府，不要在村里进行斗争吊打扣押。
    　　　　（二）抓紧时间，继续加紧副业生产，贯彻节约渡荒，准备春耕。
    宣传土地法大纲时，向贫雇说明执行土地法对贫雇最有利，贫雇是将来执行平分的领导骨干，在生产中也要起骨干推动作用，与中农团结起来努力干，对中农说明执行土地法对他们同样有好处，应该好好安心生产。只要他们对土地法学习通，是会积极起来生产的。如小辛旺过去中农很害怕，经过旧历年后中、贫农团结讨论学习，闹通了土地法的基本精神，初六以后大家就互助起来，组织起二十余头牲口，现已将七百多亩春地完全耕耙了一遍，现仍抓紧生产。今年春短，现在就要开始养种园地，现在有好晌，阳坡地已开始消冻，如不抓紧积肥、送粪、打耙，春地将来就会误种。副业生产也应马上开始活动，拿第一个百日纺织中所得利润来动员妇女，马上恢复过去组织，行动起来。男人除不误春耕准备，也要根据各村有利条件，有计划的组织起来。并要向群众说明：生产节约渡荒和春耕准备工作搞不好，生活上困难加重了，对将来进行平分是不利的，要叫他们知道平分正是为了搞好生产。代耕地应很快的分配，今年春很短，不能误了军属家的养种。查贷转贷要继续深入进行检查，没转的继续转。贫雇得到贷款后，要设法组织他们，团结中农进行生产。今年过旧历年，广大干部群众，已接受了年前政府的指示，没买卖鞭炮，很少买无益无用的东西，少买肉吃，已节约钱不少。春荒仍未过去，仍要动员群众，继续发扬过去节约渡荒的精神，节约财物，解决春荒问题。
