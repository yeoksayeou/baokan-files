    People's Blackboard
    ★ Last December 25th, when our People's Liberation Army was fighting the Chiang bandit troops north of Jimo County, Shandong, five American devil soldiers drove a car onto the battlefield to help the Chiang bandits fight us. We were not polite and killed one of them and captured four. Our PLA headquarters wants the American devil soldiers' commander to apologize to us and order all American soldiers stationed in China to get out!
    ★ The Korean people have great respect for our Chairman Mao: The Korean people are rushing to read Chairman Mao's reports. Our Land Law Outline is also being printed in Korea.
    ★ Employed worker Guo Yongliang spent money and lost work time due to marriage issues and has been in litigation for almost a year. The government has been dragging its feet and exhibiting some bureaucratism. He hopes that things can be sorted out quickly before the spring plowing.
    ★ The border region government has established a cigarette company. In the future, cigarettes will be manufactured by the public, and anyone who wants to sell them can buy them at the distribution points.

    ★去年十二月廿五号，咱解放军在山东即墨县以北跟蒋匪军打仗，有五个美国鬼子兵开着一辆汽车冲到战场上，帮助蒋匪跟咱打，咱们也就不客气，打死他一个，捉住了四个。咱解放军总部要美国鬼子兵的司令给咱赔罪，叫所有驻在中国的美国兵都滚蛋！
    ★朝鲜老百姓对咱毛主席非常尊敬：毛主席的报告，朝鲜人民抢着看。咱们土地法大纲，朝鲜也在印。
    ★雇工郭永亮为了婚姻问题花钱误工，打了快够一年的官司，政府拖来拖去，有些官僚主义，他希望春耕以前快快弄出个眉目来。
    ★边区政府成立了个纸烟公司，以后纸烟都由公家制造，谁想贩卖，就到分销处去买就行。
