The following experiences were put forward by Huolu County in connecting and mobilizing the poor and hired peasants:

    I. First, there must be a determination to find and employ poor peasants. This is a test of every comrade's class viewpoint. At mass meetings, the cadres' covenant was read out: Eat the food of the poor and hired peasants, live in the houses of the poor and hired peasants. When we first arrived at the homes of poor and hired peasants, they worried that we would dislike their dilapidated houses, bad food, and the fact that they were too poor to even have a place to sit. But after we explained, "Where you sleep, we will sleep. What you eat, we will eat." County Chief Zhang Xiangnan went to Fangtai to visit a poor and hired peasant. The family felt that since the county chief had arrived, they quickly borrowed a small stool from someone else, but the county chief just sat down on the ground, without using the stool. Liang Lantian went to Gaoqian Village to visit a poor and hired peasant. There was some manure in his house, and he was afraid we would think it was dirty, so he tried to sit on the manure to block it, but Comrade Lantian saw through this and sat next to him. Once, while eating in Nan Ganzi, the masses and us were eating two different kinds of food. Comrade Wei Shanqi of the County Party Committee put aside the rice and flour cakes and grabbed the masses' black flour residue cake to eat, saying, "A family doesn't eat two different kinds of food." Eating and sleeping in the homes of the poor and hired peasants like this was a support for the poor and hired peasants, restricted the destructive activities of the landlords, and established a close relationship with the poor and hired peasants. The poor and hired peasants cared for us very much, afraid that we would be cold, and asked us to eat on the kang.

    II. Solving the actual difficulties in the lives of the poor and hired peasants: The lives of the poor and hired peasant masses in the new district are very difficult. Some poor and hired peasants don't have anything to eat right now and can't wait. Some first confiscated a few households to solve the current living problems of the poor and hired peasants, and the enthusiasm for the struggle became greater. In addition, it is also necessary to promptly solve various difficulties of the poor and hired peasants: County Chief Zhang went to Wei Xizi's home in Fangtai. His family of three was covering themselves with a torn quilt, and his mother was afraid that we would see it and be embarrassed, so she tightly covered it with a torn cloth bag. After County Chief Zhang discovered this, he temporarily borrowed two quilts for him from the village. The old lady was very grateful and told everyone she met, becoming a good propagandist for us.

    III. Care for everyone in the families of the poor and hired peasants. When we arrive at the homes of the poor and hired peasants, we cannot immediately make political demands, and immediately ask how many houses? How many acres of land? How many people? Who is good and who is bad in your village? You deserve to be rebuffed if you do that. We should first become a family in terms of thoughts and emotions. If we see a sick person, we should ask what is wrong? How long has it been? Hurry up and ask a doctor to treat it! If you see a child, you can hug them and ask if they are cold. Our sincere love and care for everyone in the families of the poor and hired peasants easily turns us into a family in terms of thoughts and emotions, making them feel like we are really a family, and it becomes convenient to talk about problems. Before the masses thoroughly understand you, don't say anything or look around when you see young women in the family. After a long time, they will take the initiative to approach us.

    IV. Using suffering to elicit suffering, introducing our own experiences: After Comrade Wang Xiuhai introduced his suffering of begging for two years and herding sheep for fifteen years, the poor and hired peasants said: "Comrade Wang is so similar to us! He is also a poor person." After that, many poor and hired peasants automatically went to Comrade Wang Xiuhai to complain. After Li Fengying of Nan Ganzi complained in the poor and hired peasant group, cadre Wang Xinjin complained about the tragic situation of his entire family of six dying of starvation and being scattered. The whole group cried. At this time, everyone was vying to tell their own suffering.

    获鹿访贫雇经验
    魏善琦  孙成文
    获鹿县在串通发动贫雇中提出了以下的经验：
    一、首先要有找雇贫的决心，这是每个同志阶级观点的考验。在群众会上宣读了干部公约：吃贫雇的饭，住贫雇的房。我们开始一到贫雇家，他顾虑我们嫌房子破，吃的坏，家里穷连个坐的地方也没。但经我们说明：“你睡在那里，俺睡在那里。你吃啥饭，俺也吃啥饭。”县长张香楠在方台去访问贫雇，该户觉着县长到了，赶快到别人家借了个小板凳，县长就一屁股坐在地下，没有坐凳子。梁兰田在高迁村去访贫雇，他家里有些粪，怕我们嫌脏，想坐在粪上把它挡住，兰田同志看透这步，就和他并坐了。一次在南甘子吃饭，群众和我们吃的两样饭，县委魏善琦同志放着米面饼子不吃，上前抓住群众的黑粉渣饼子吃，并说：“一家人不吃两样饭。”这样分散在贫雇家里吃饭睡觉，对贫雇是个撑腰，限制了地主的破坏活动，与贫雇建立了密切的感情。贫雇对我们非常爱护，怕冻着我们，叫我们到炕上吃饭。
    二、给贫雇解决生活上的实际困难：新区贫雇群众的生活非常困难，有些贫雇因现在就没吃的，等不上。有的首先没收了几户，解决了贫雇户当前的生活问题，斗争的劲头就大了。此外还要及时解决贫雇的各种困难：张县长到方台魏喜子家，他家三人伙盖着一条破被子，他娘怕看见嫌丢人，紧用破布袋盖。张县长发觉后，给他从村里暂借了二条被子，这个老太太非常感谢，见人就说，见人就讲，成了我们很好的宣传员。
    三、关心贫雇家里的一切人，我们到了贫雇家里，不能一开始就提出政治要求，开口就问几间房子？几亩地？几口人？你村谁好谁坏？这样活该你碰钉子。应首先从思想情绪上变为一家，看见病人就问什么病？多长时间了？赶快请医生治治吧！见了小孩就可以抱抱，问他冷吗？我们对贫雇家里的一切人真诚的爱护与关心，很容易与贫雇在思想情绪上变为一家，使他感到真是一家人，说问题就方便了。在群众未彻底了解你之前，到家里见了年青女人，千万别说话，也不要乱看，时间长了他就会主动的接近我们。
    四、以苦引苦，介绍我们本身的事：王修海同志介绍了自己讨饭二年，放羊十五年的苦后，贫雇说：“王同志这样沾！也是个穷人，以后许多贫雇就自动去找王修海同志诉苦。南甘子李凤英在贫雇组诉苦后，干部王新金把自己全家六口人饿死失散的惨状诉苦了一遍，全组哭起来，这时大家都争着把自己的苦诉出来了。
