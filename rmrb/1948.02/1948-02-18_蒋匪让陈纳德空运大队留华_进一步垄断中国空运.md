Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th:

    Chennault's Air Transport Group of the U.S. imperialists, which originally invaded our airspace under the guise of Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Executive Headquarters, has now formally obtained permission from the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's traitorous government to continue to remain in China. On the 7th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency already admitted that the team "has been specially permitted by the (Chiang) government to exist temporarily for one year." Chennault's Air Transport Group was established in August of the year before last, as one of the traitorous conditions Chiang Kai-shek Bandit paid to the U.S. imperialists in the surplus materials sales negotiations at the time. The team's routes were initially set for Shanghai, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Guilin, Hengyang, and Liuzhou, and were later expanded to Qingdao, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Dihua, Kunming, and Guiyang. Recently, Guangzhou has been re-designated as its aviation headquarters, and Hainan Island has been included in its navigation network. Chennault's statement in Shanghai in the middle of last month clearly showed that the U.S. imperialists are using the pretext of "improving Chinese transportation" to further strengthen their monopoly over China's air transport industry.

    蒋匪让陈纳德空运大队留华
    进一步垄断中国空运
    【新华社陕北十一日电】原借蒋匪行总名义侵略我领空权之美帝陈纳德空运大队，现已正式取得蒋匪卖国政府之允许，继续留存中国。本月七日蒋匪中央社已供认该队“业经（蒋）政府决定特许其暂行存在一年”。按陈纳德空运大队系于前年八月间成立，为当时蒋匪在剩余物资出售谈判中支付美帝的卖国条件之一。该队航线，最初规定为沪、浔、穗、汉、桂、衡、柳七地，后又扩展至青岛、太原、兰州、迪化、昆明、贵阳等地。最近复定广州为其航空总站，并将海南岛包括于其航行网中。上月中旬陈纳德在上海发表的声明即明白显示美帝正借口“改进中国运输”，进一步加强对中国空运事业垄断。
