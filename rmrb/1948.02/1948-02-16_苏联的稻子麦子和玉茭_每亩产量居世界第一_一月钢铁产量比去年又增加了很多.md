Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th dispatch: Moscow News: Soviet academician Gakushikin, in his recently published new work on agronomy, listed figures to illustrate that Soviet agriculture is far superior to that of capitalist countries. The harvest volume per hectare of many basic grains has broken world records. The Soviet rice harvest volume reaches 150 centners per hectare (equivalent to 16 Chinese mu, or 15,000 Chinese catties), while the highest foreign record is only 90 centners. The Soviet corn harvest volume is above 150 centners per hectare, while the highest foreign record has never exceeded 100 centners. The Soviet summer wheat harvest record reaches 101 centners per hectare, and winter wheat also reaches 83 centners.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th dispatch: Moscow News: News of the victorious completion of the January production plan is coming from all over the Soviet Union. At the end of last month, advanced factories such as Europe's largest Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant and Zaporozhye Steel Plant had already exceeded the January plan. The Donbass coal mining trusts have exceeded the January plan. Compared with December of last year, the output of various departments of local steel factories in January this year increased by 13.4 percent for iron milling, 21.2 percent for steel production, and the production of iron and manganese in January also exceeded the plan. The oil industry in Grozny Oblast increased production by 57 percent compared to January of last year. At the beginning of 1948, Soviet agriculture also achieved great success in striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In advanced cities such as Leningrad and Moscow, many factories are already producing for the late February or March plans. The first week of February shows that industrial and agricultural production is still growing at an undiminished pace. Pravda said: "All this news fully demonstrates the socialist consciousness of the working people and the increasing strength of Soviet patriotism."

    苏联的稻子麦子和玉茭
    每亩产量居世界第一
    一月钢铁产量比去年又增加了很多
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联大学士加库锡金在其最近出版之农学新著中，列举数字说明苏联农业远较资本主义国家为优。多种基本谷物每公顷收获量已打破世界纪录。苏联稻子收获量每公顷（合中国十六市亩）达一百五十生丁纳（合中国一万五千市斤），而外国最高纪录仅收九十生丁纳。苏联玉蜀黍收获量每公顷在一百五十生丁纳以上，而外国最高纪录从未超过一百生丁纳。苏联夏麦收获纪录达每公顷一百零一生丁纳，冬麦亦达八十三生丁纳。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】莫斯科讯：胜利完成一月份生产计划的消息，从苏联各地纷纷传来。上月底，各先进工厂如欧洲最大的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂以及萨波罗什钢铁厂已超过一月份计划。顿巴斯各煤矿托拉斯已超过一月份计划，当地钢铁工厂各部门之产量，和去年十二月份相较，今年一月份铣铁产量增加百分之十三点四，钢产量增加百分之二十一点二，一月份铁与锰的产量也超过计划。格罗兹尼州的石油工业，则较之去年一月，增产百分之五十七。一九四八年初，苏联农业在争取提前完成五年计划中亦获得伟大成就。先进城市如列宁格勒、莫斯科，许多工厂已在为二月份下旬或三月份计划而生产。二月份第一周显示着工农业生产仍以毫无减色的步调增长着。真理报说：“这一切消息，充分证明劳动人民的社会主义自觉性，以及苏维埃爱国主义力量的日益增长。”
