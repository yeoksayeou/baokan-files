Dragging people in and pulling them out, the composition of the "Poor Peasant League" became not entirely poor peasants. Cadres came in, and upper-middle peasants also came in. The leader of the "Poor Peasant League," Gao Changfu, was the vice director of the Farmers' Association and also a branch committee member. There were also five people including Wang Huaizhi, the deputy director of civil education, Wang Zhanquan and Wang Yuchun, standing committee members of the Farmers' Association, and Wang Wenxiu, the street chief. According to Wang Gongliang, Wang Zhengqing, and Wang Cun, Liu Yuchun is an upper-middle peasant. His family has six people, with four full laborers, now cultivating fourteen mu of land (including five mu of good land), with a total output of fourteen dan. He also has a donkey and four or five sheep, and a compound. (The village's per capita average is less than half a mu of good land, and the average output per person is about two dan.) They also said that Wang Xueyou and Wang Huaizhi are all upper-middle peasant households. However, some people with good class backgrounds were left out of the "Poor Peasant League." For example, poor peasant Wang Congyi, according to Guo Jinzhu: "I heard that he used to be superstitious, didn't eat onions and garlic, and he has seventy or eighty small walnut trees that he cultivates himself. Everyone wanted to divide them equally, but he couldn't accept the idea, so he wasn't allowed to join." Wang Zongtang and Wang Jiutang, who have been herding cattle and sheep for three generations and are still herding cattle and sheep for the Farmers' Association and the village, have not yet joined the "Poor Peasant League."

After the "Poor Peasant League" was established, the first major event was to struggle against poor peasant Wang Zhengqing (nicknamed Lao Wudan). Wang Zhengqing was a shop assistant in a mutton soup shop run by the militia. A shepherd working for the soup shop picked up a sheep lost by the village hospital and asked him to slaughter it for thirteen and a half jin of meat, which the soup shop sold. When the hospital heard that Wang Zhengqing had slaughtered the sheep, it asked the "Poor Peasant League" to handle it. The "Poor Peasant League" brought Wang Zhengqing to a meeting and struggled against him. They brought up three mistakes: 1. Historical corruption; 2. Speculation; 3. Sabotaging the relationship between the army and the people, and asked him to confess. According to Wang Hainiu, an activist in the "Poor Peasant League": Wang Zhengqing is too bad, even though his class background is good. The honest peasants didn't know how to solve the problem. Director Gao said: "I've held many meetings, let me say a few words. It's not about compensating for the things, it's mainly about fixing your thoughts." The first day of the meeting, Wang Zhengqing was cried, but the problem was not solved. The next day, he admitted that he planned to take a sheep home. Everyone decided to ask him to compensate the hospital with a sheep worth twenty jin of meat, plus "support" the purchase of ten to fifteen jin of mutton, which he accepted one by one. He said: "I want to follow the mass line. Everyone agrees with my opinion. If I commit another offense in the future, confine me for a month." When he talked to the reporter about this matter, he said with his mouth: "I'm not convinced, I'm not convinced," but tears kept falling from his eyes.

Some peasants who had stood up, even though they had not been directly hit by the "Poor Peasant League," were still uneasy and constantly afraid. Wang Qi, who participated in the "Poor Peasant League," said: "People say I am a lower-middle peasant, and also an honest peasant. The village averages two dan of grain per mu, but my land is not good, and the yield is high. My family of four only produces about seven dan. I am sixty-three years old, and people asked me to participate in the Poor Peasant League twice, and then never asked me again. My thinking... Cough, cough! I guess I have become a rich peasant?! I went to the Poor Peasant League to ask, and Yang Hai said: 'If we ask you to come, you come; if we don't ask you to come, you don't have to come.' I don't know what's going on! The Poor Peasant League distributed some clothes once (sent by the district), wrote my name on them, but didn't give them to me. Could it be that I have some kind of problem!"

Organizing poor peasant production and stopping waste was one of the purposes of establishing the "Poor Peasant League." It was done, but it was too wrong. They took 260,000 yuan of fruit money from the Farmers' Association to sell pork. The idea was to earn dividends for the poor peasants and get some meat to eat. Wang @ Lin and two others were selected to do this. However, they didn't understand this business, so they found a landlord named Hu Tingliang and paid him 400 yuan a day. They bought 580 jin of pork from other villages at once. The business was not very good, and 90 jin were left unsold. After calculating the accounts, including shrinkage and expenses, there was still a shortage of 34,000 yuan. After discussing it, they thought that selling these 90 jin at 385 yuan per jin could recover the money. So they said to divide it up and let the poor peasants eat it. Director Gao said: "Even though it's cheap, you can't buy too much." But what did the poor peasant Guo Jinzhu say? He said: "The Poor Peasant League got meat (the meat was not good, the political director Hu Tingxuan said: 'Mostly legs'), but couldn't sell it, so they asked me to pay 400 yuan per jin. I can't afford that. I can't even bear to buy vermicelli." The meat couldn't be sold in the village, so they had to go to Beixijing to sell it, and I don't know if it was all sold.

Vice Village Chief Hao Guitian calculated the account of waste during this year's Lunar New Year: the "Poor Peasant League" bought 580 jin of meat for the village, plus what the mutual aid group had bought, totaling more than 1,000 jin, at least 500 jin more than in previous years. Each person ate at least two jin more of white flour (like the well-to-do middle peasant Zhang Jiajun, who pushed one dou of wheat in previous years, and one and a half dou this year), wasting 2,000 jin in the whole village, plus other waste (like middle peasant Hu Qicai, who bought ten jin of vermicelli in previous years, and twenty-three jin this year), totaling 1 million yuan. The village wasted so much, but the "Poor Peasant League" did not stop it, but added fuel to the fire. Until now, other villages are still constantly selling meat to Nanxijing. On the 5th, police officer Guo Qinglin even sold three jin and two liang.

### 旧干部领导假贫雇团不干正事

    旧干部领导假贫雇团不干正事
    拉来拉去，“贫雇团”的成份就不完全是贫雇了，干部进来了，上中农也进来了。“贫雇团”的领导人高长富就是农会副主任，又是支部委员。还有民教副主任王怀节，农会常委王占全、王玉春、街长王文修等五人。据王功亮、王正清、王存三个人反映：刘玉春是上中农，他家六口人，合四个全劳力，现种十四亩地（其中有五亩好地），共合十四大石产量。还有一个驴、四五只羊，一串院。（全村按人口平均，每人还均不到半亩好地，每人平均产量两石左右。）他三个人还说，王学有、王怀节等都是上中农户。可是有好些成份好的，却被丢在“贫雇团”外面。比方贫农王从义，据郭金柱说：“听说他过去迷信，不吃葱蒜，他有自己作务的七八十棵小核桃树，大家要均均，他思想想不通，不叫他入。”三辈子放牛放羊，现在还给农会、村里放牛放羊的王宗堂、王久堂也还没有参加“贫雇团”。
    “贫雇团”成立以后，头一桩大事是斗争贫农王正清（外号老五旦）。王正清在民兵羊汤铺当伙计，羊汤铺羊工拾了驻村医院丢的一只羊，叫他杀了十三斤半肉，羊汤铺卖了。医院听说羊是王正清杀了，叫“贫雇团”处理，“贫雇团”就把王正清弄到会上斗了一顿。提出他三个错误：一、历史腐化；二、投机取巧；三、破坏军民关系，叫他坦白。据“贫雇团”积极分子王海牛说：王正清这家伙太坏，就是成份好。老实农民不知道怎么解决才好。高主任说：“我开的会多，我来说说。倒不是说赔东西，主要是搞你的思想。”头天开会，斗哭了王正清，也没解决。第二天他承认自己打算弄一个羊回家。大家就决定叫他赔医院二十斤肉的一只羊，另外“拥护”羊肉十斤到十五斤，他一一接受。他说：“我要走群众路线儿，大家意见都同意，以后再犯了，禁闭我一个月。”他向记者谈起这桩事，嘴上说：“不屈，不屈”，眼里却一直掉泪。
    有的翻身户虽没受过“贫雇团”直接打击，也弄得神魂不安，老是害怕。参加“贫雇团”的王起说：“人家说我是下中农，也是老实农民。村上平均两石产粮，我的地不好，产量又高，我家四口人，就七石来产量。我六十三了，人家叫我参加了两次贫雇会，就再不叫我了。我思想……咳咳！我大概成了富农了？！找到贫雇会去问，杨孩说：‘这事，叫你来你就来，不叫你来你就不用来。’也不知道是怎会事！贫雇团分了一回衣裳（区里发的），写上咱的名又不给咱。咱该不是有个圪塔哩！”
    组织贫雇生产，制止浪费，是“贫雇团”成立的一个目的。做也做了，就是太不对头。他们拿上农会的二十六万果实款，去贩卖猪肉。说的是给贫雇赚红利，弄点肉吃吃。就选了王＠林等二人办这个事。可是他俩不懂这一行，又觅了个地主，叫胡廷亮，一天给他四百块钱的工钱。到外村一下子买回五百八十斤猪肉。买卖不算很好，剩下九十斤没人要了。一算帐，连折秤加花消，还短三万四千块钱不够本。合计了一下，这九十斤按三百八十五块一斤卖出去，能捞回来钱。就说分一分，叫贫农大家都吃吃。高主任说：“看是便宜，想多买也不行。”可是贫农郭金柱怎么说呢？他说：“贫雇团弄了肉（肉不好，政治主任胡廷选说：‘净些腿腿’），卖不了，叫我掏四百块钱一斤，我吃不起那，我连粉条还舍不得秤哩。”本村卖不出去，只好到北西井去卖，也不知道卖光了没有。
    今年过阴历年的浪费帐，副村长郝贵田算了一下：“贫雇团”往村里买了五百八十斤肉，加上互助组贩来的，够一千多斤，比往年至少浪费五百斤。每人至少多吃二斤白面（象富裕中农张家俊，往年推一斗麦子，今年推一斗五升），全村浪费两千斤，加上旁的浪费（象中农胡起才，往年称十来斤粉条儿，今年称了二十三斤），就够一百万元。村里浪费的这么厉害，“贫雇团”没制止，倒是火上泼了瓢油。直到现在，外村还不断朝南西井卖肉，五日那天，公安员郭清林还卖了三斤二两。
