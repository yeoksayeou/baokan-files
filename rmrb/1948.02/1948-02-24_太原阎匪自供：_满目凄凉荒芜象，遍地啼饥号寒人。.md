Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. Taiyuan dispatch: "A desolate and barren sight everywhere, people crying from hunger and cold everywhere." This is the miserable state of the villages near Taiyuan isolated island under the tyrannical "soldier-farmer integration" policy implemented by the bandit Yan Xishan, a situation that one of his Taiyuan city councilors had to admit. A certain councilor of the Yan bandit confessed at a meeting on the 12th of last month: "The biggest crisis in the countryside today (under the rule of the Yan bandit) is that nine-tenths of the fields are lying waste. The people are busy with corvée labor and lack cattle, farming tools, and seeds. Only one-tenth of the wheat has been planted, and most of the land has not been plowed." Another confessed: Several hundred acres of good farmland in Qin Xian Village are uncultivated. He said: The disasters and sufferings suffered by the countryside today are rarely seen in history. Some people cannot say how much they are burdened with. An old man said: "I cultivate more than 40 acres of land, and I have to pay more than ten *shi* of grain. The income from a year of hard work is not enough to cover the burden." Some of the common people have no choice but to take out the statues of gods in their homes and sell them.

　　太原阎匪自供：“满目凄凉荒芜象，遍地啼饥号寒人。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】太原讯：“满目凄凉荒芜象，遍地啼饥号寒人”。此为阎匪锡山实行“兵农合一”暴政下太原孤岛附近农村的惨状，而为其太原市某参议员所不得不承认者。阎匪某参议员在上月十二日会议上供认：“今日（阎匪统治下的）农村中最大的危机是十分之九的田亩在荒着，百姓因差役忙，缺乏牛和耕具、种籽、麦仅种了十分之一，大半地没有翻耕”。另一个供认：亲贤村的几百亩大好田地无人耕种。他说：农村今日所受灾难与痛苦，为有史以来所少见。若干人民说不清他负担几何，一位老年人说：“我种四十多亩地，负担就得十几石粮，终年辛苦所得，不够负担”。还有的老百姓只好把家供的神像都搬出来卖。
