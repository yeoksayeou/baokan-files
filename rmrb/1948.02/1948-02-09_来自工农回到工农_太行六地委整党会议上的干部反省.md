Cadre Introspection at the Taihang Sixth Prefecture Party Committee Rectification Meeting

Zhang Yanni's Introspection on Seizing Fruits

(Lower-middle peasant background, peasant origin, branch committee member, joined the Party in January 1946, started working in November 1946).

I am from Beizhang Village. I used to be the chairman of the Farmers' Association. There are still 19 poor and hired peasant households in the village who have not yet turned over, and three rich peasant households have not been struggled against. Thirteen households have turned over. My background is lower-middle peasant. In the past, I was politically oppressed, but I did not suffer in life. The branch secretary is a veteran soldier of poor and hired peasant origin, good at flaunting his seniority. The head of the village, Zhang Feng, is a poor peasant who used to smoke opium. The deputy head of the village is a poor peasant; his grandfather was a landlord, but his family declined in his father's hands. He is afraid of nothing. The deputy director only thinks about finding petty advantages and is of poor peasant origin.

During the Double Reduction [of rent and interest] campaign, the cadres discussed and decided to hold a struggle meeting through the Farmers' Association. If the poor and hired peasants raised opinions that did not meet my decided goals, I would suppress them. During the Double Reduction campaign, I also exchanged four mu of land. The poor peasant Zhang Ziyin had his land seized by the landlord. He asked the cadres to support him, but I said, "Zhang Ziyin, if you want to raise it, raise it; if you don't want to, forget it," thus suppressing him.

After the May 4th Directive [referring to a CCP directive on land reform], when distributing land, houses, and livestock, there was no grading. Except for the targets of struggle, regardless of middle or poor peasants, they were divided into seven groups, with cadres participating in each group, asking everyone to make requests. But some poor and hired peasants had been suppressed. After asking for land, they dared not ask for houses; after asking for houses, they dared not ask for livestock. The cadres were afraid of nothing, asking for livestock, land, and houses. Active elements were elected as evaluators. As a result, good land and good houses were given to cadres, evaluators, and military dependents. I said that cadres had made great contributions and should be taken care of. The middle and rich peasants were afraid of being struggled against and also agreed. But at the time, I still thought I was following the poor and hired peasant line.

The finance and grain committee member was a landowner who operated land. He asked to donate land. The cadres told him to do it voluntarily. The poor and hired peasants said he was not thorough enough. As a result, things were searched out, and he was driven out. The militia then searched out several bundles. I, along with six Party members and a dozen militiamen, collectively embezzled and divided the bundles. I got a felt blanket.

Another time was stealing fruits. The village head, deputy village head, Farmers' Association chairman, militia instructor, and militiamen were involved. At the time, the idea was that they were all distributed to the masses, and the masses would not say anything good. They stole them so the masses would not know. The militia stood guard and stole some. I got a quilt and a lined pair of trousers. When collecting fruits, I also stole a pair of shoes, a pair of glasses, and a single pair of trousers.

When discussing the distribution of farm tools, clothes, and grain, we asked the Farmers' Association to discuss how to distribute them. The poor and hired peasants did not say anything. I said that the land had already been distributed, clothes were for people to wear, grain was for people to eat, and farm tools were for people to use. Let's distribute them according to population, with one widow counted as two people. The branch secretary was afraid that the stolen goods could not be taken out, so he said let's distribute them according to the number of households, except for the targets of struggle. As soon as the Farmers' Association chairman announced it, some people said they were busy and that it should be distributed this way. These were the middle and rich peasants speaking. At the time, I thought that everyone except the targets of struggle were the masses. I did not think of the poor and hired peasants.

After stealing the fruits, three Party members heard the masses' feedback that some people had stolen the fruits. They did not admit it. Later, at the Party member meeting, they still shielded each other, asking if the masses' feedback was factual and whether it was instigated by special agents, suppressing the masses.

Several comrades in the branch had turned over too much. They said that after struggling against the rich peasants, they revealed themselves, and if they developed further, they would become the target to be struggled against. After distributing the fruits, we held a mass meeting and said that we would not struggle against them anymore. Did everyone have the idea of cutting chives [getting back on their feet]? The middle and rich peasants and the active elements who had turned over said no, while the honest poor and hired peasants did not say anything. I thought I was following the mass line, but in reality, I was following the middle and rich peasant and active element line.

In the past, I dared not say that I stole fruits because of my own face. When studying in the First Sub-district, Political Commissar Jia said that the upper and lower levels were impure. After calculating myself, there were 19 households that had not completely turned over. The fruits I stole were worth more than 30,000 yuan. In order to save my own face, I dared not say it. If I did not say it, the other comrades would not say it either. These cadres would not follow the poor and hired peasant line, and the 19 households could not turn over. I felt that if I embezzled the fruits, I would be impure and could not follow the poor and hired peasant line.

Cao Guangshui's Introspection on Forgetting the Origin

(Red-poor background, born a hired worker, union cadre, joined the Party in July 1946, transferred out of work in November 1947).

There are 317 households in Northeast Liu Village. There are 47 targets of struggle, but only 15 households were thoroughly struggled against. Why? After the May 4th Directive came down, I resolutely demanded struggle because I had not turned over, had nothing to eat or drink, and had great fighting spirit. The first batch struggled against five big households. The struggle against Zhang Pei did not go well at the beginning and was ridiculed by the landlords. The main reason was that my team was not well organized. I was the hired worker director. There were 47 hired workers. After the meeting, I gathered the hired workers and used actual examples to get through their thinking and break through their personal feelings to overthrow the five big households. The fruits were distributed in first, second, and third grades. Some middle peasants also received some. First grade was 10,000 yuan, second grade 8,000 yuan, and third grade 5,000 yuan. As a result, the poor and middle peasants and the bankrupt landlords and cadres got them, but the hired workers did not. I was not satisfied, and the hired workers were not satisfied either. They had resistance thoughts and wanted to quit. I thought of disbanding the hired worker organization. But after reviewing it at night, I felt it was wrong. If it were disbanded, I would not be able to turn over myself. The next day, I discussed with the hired workers how to turn over. As a result, they sent representatives to the village head and Farmers' Association chairman, preparing to cause factionalism and opinions. The village head agreed to give the hired workers special treatment in the future. In July, another 19 households were struggled against. There were also a lot of fruits obtained. This time, the fruits that could be taken away, such as grain and vegetables, were left for the hired workers from outside. Each hired worker received 300 jin of grain. This time, the fruits were distributed in three grades and nine levels. After going to the district for a meeting in October, the hired worker Hao Cong mobilized to organize hired tenants and the poor. I was the director. I began to deeply struggle. The fruits that came out of the struggle were particularly many and were also distributed in three grades and nine levels. Now, examining the households that were struggled against, only 15 households were thorough. The rest were not thoroughly struggled against. Some were military dependents, and some were shielded by cadres, including me. There were two rich peasants, Du Cungui and Wang Xiang. The cadres said that they worked hard, were poor in their childhood, and started their families through thrift, so they were not struggled against. Those who were not thoroughly struggled against, like Li Ruwen, only had their floating wealth and land confiscated. The cadres considered that he had cash, but the Farmers' Association chairman said he did not. The village head told me he did. There was a contradiction. I was not convinced. I investigated it at night and took out 20 yuan in cash. At that time, I felt that I was capable and had more conflicts with the Farmers' Association chairman. One day, the Farmers' Association wanted to hang Li Ruwen. Du Zongshan of the Farmers' Association said he guaranteed that he had cash. I said I did not know, and everyone did not hang him. I thought, I am not as good as Du Zongshan (I am from a small family), and I am afraid that I will not be able to survive without cash, so I was afraid and not firm. Also, Qiao Sicong sealed the door and was not struggled against. Just as we were about to confiscate him, the county education section chief Kong Zhanfeng sent several letters, and the district chief also explained that Qiao had been a senator. After all, he went through with the masses once, so he was not struggled against. Everyone was discouraged. Now he is still satisfied. At that time, I was shaken. Du Zongshan is Qiao Sicong's nephew. One day, Qiao brought a bottle of wine to Du Zongshan's house. I followed him to see what he was doing. I went over to the gate and heard Qiao say, "I am going to the county government clinic. Please take care of my family." I went into the house. Du Zongshan said, "My relative brought something. What do you think we should do?" I could not break through my personal feelings and said, "Put it down." I also drank two glasses. I thought that drinking wine was not me covering him up, but Du Zongshan covering him up. At that time, I forgot the masses.

The land was distributed first to military dependents, then to cadres, and then to the poor and hired peasants. At this time, some bad land could not be distributed. The cadres said that the struggle was thorough. I was also shaken and thought that the struggle was thorough. In fact, the poor and hired peasants had not completely turned over, and feudalism had not been thoroughly struggled against. At this time, I also complained that the poor and hired peasants did not want the land. Now I realize that it was not that the poor and hired peasants did not want the land, but that the good land had been taken away by the cadres and military dependents, so of course the poor and hired peasants did not want the bad land. Looking back, those who said the struggle was thorough were the middle and rich peasants and some cadres who had eaten their fill. I myself had completely turned over, with a house, land, and a big cart. My thinking changed, and I forgot my origin.

    太行六地委整党会议上的干部反省
    张燕尼反省窃占果实
    （成份下中农，农民出身，分委，四六年一月入党，四六年十一月参加工作）。
    我是北张庄的，我当过农会主任。现在全村尚有十九户贫雇未翻身，有三户富农未斗。翻身过了的有十三户。我的成份是下中农，过去政治上受压迫，生活上未受难。支书是荣退军人、贫雇成份，好摆资格，正村长张凤是贫雇，吸过料面，副村长是贫雇，他爷是财主，父亲手里破落了，他啥也不怕，副主任光想找些小便宜，是贫雇成份。
    双减时干部一商量，通过农会开斗争会，贫雇提意见不合我决定的目标，就打击贫雇。双减时我也换了四亩地。贫雇张子隐被地主夺去了地，他要求干部替他说撑腰，我却说：“张子隐，你想提就提，不提就拉倒”，打击了他。
    五四指示后，分土地、房子、牲口没划等，除斗争对象外，不管中贫农分七个小组，每组都有干部参加，叫各人提出要求。但有些贫雇受过打击，要求了地，就不敢要求房子，要了房子不敢要牲口，干部啥也不怕，要牲口、要地、要房子。选举积极分子当评议员，结果好地好房都给了干部、评议员、军属。我说干部功大，应该照顾一下，中农富农怕斗，也跟着说好，但自己当时还认为走了贫雇路线。
    财粮委员是经营地主，他要求献田，干部叫他自动，贫雇说他不彻底，结果搜出来东西，把他赶了出去。民兵又去搜出几个包袱，我和六个党员十几个民兵，把包袱集体贪污分了，我得了一个毡子。
    又一次是偷果实。有正副村长、农会主任、民兵指导员、民兵，当时思想说都分给了群众，群众也不说好，偷了群众也不知道。由民兵站了岗，偷了几个，我分了一个被子、一条夹裤，又在收果实时偷了一双鞋、一付眼镜、一条单裤。
    讨论分农具衣服粮食等时，叫农会讨论如何分，贫雇不吭，我就说地都分到了，衣是人穿的，粮食是人吃的，农具是人用的，按人口分吧，寡妇一口按二人分。支书怕偷了东西没法拿出来，就说按灶户门分吧，除了斗争对象外一律分。农会主任一宣布下去，就有人说正在忙，就该这样分，这是中农富农说的。当时我想，除了斗争对象外都是群众，没有想到贫雇。
    偷果实后，有三个党员听到群众反映，说有人偷了果实，自己不承认，后来开党员大会，仍然互相打包庇，说群众反映有没有事实？是不是受了特务的挑拨？把群众都顶住了。
    支部有几个同志翻身翻过了，说斗争完富农，就露出了自己，自己再发展，就成了目标要被斗。分果实后，开群众大会，说以后不斗了，大家有没有割韭菜思想？中富农和翻身翻过的积极分子，都说没有，而老实贫雇不吭，自己思想以为走了群众路线，实际走了中富农和积极分子路线。
    过去不敢说自己偷果实，是自己脸面关系，到一分区学习，贾政委说上下不纯，经自己一算，有十九户未翻透身，自己偷的果实，值三万多元，为了保存自己脸面不敢说出来，自己不说出来，其他几个同志亦不会说，这些干部亦不会走贫雇路线，十九户就不能翻身，我觉得贪污了果实就不纯，就不能走贫雇路线。
    曹光水反省忘了本
    （成份赤贫，出身雇工，联合社干部，四六年七月入党，四七年十一月调出工作。）
    东北流村共三一七户。斗争对象四七户，但斗彻底的只十五户。为啥呢？在五四指示下来后，我思想上坚决要求斗争，因自己没翻身，没吃没喝，斗争性很大。头批斗争五大户，开始斗张佩没斗争好，反遭地主们讥笑了一顿，主要是自己队伍未搞好。我是雇工主任，雇工有四七个，散会后我召集雇工，拿实际例子来打通了雇工思想，打破了情面斗倒了五大户。分果实是按一、二、三等分的，有些中农也分到了。一等是一万元，二等八千元，三等五千元。结果贫中农和破落地主干部都得了，就雇工没有，我不满意，雇工们也都不满意，有抵抗思想，想不干了，我就想解散雇工组织。但夜间检讨了一下，觉得不对，假如解散了，就连自己也翻不了身，第二天就找雇工讨论，怎样才能翻身。结果推代表去找村长、农会主任，准备闹宗派、闹意见，村长答应以后特别与雇工分。到七月又斗争了十九户，得的果实也不少，这次就与外来雇工留下一部能拿走的果实，如粮食菜等，每个雇工分到三百斤粮食。这次分果实是分三等九级分的。十月去区开会后，那时雇工郝从，就发动组织雇佃贫，我是主任，开始深入斗争，斗争出来果实特别多，也分三等九级分了。现在检查被斗户，只有十五户彻底了，其余没斗透，有的是军属，有的是干部掩护的，连我在内。有二户富农杜存贵、王祥，干部说人家劳动好，小时也穷，节约省俭起家的，故没斗。没斗透的象李如文，只把浮财和地没收了，干部考虑他有现洋，但农会主任说没有，村长和我说有，矛盾起来，我不服，晚上追查了一下，拿出二十元现洋，那时我觉得自己有能力，愈加和农会主任有矛盾。又一天晚上，农会要吊李如文，农会杜宗山说保证人家有现洋，我说不知道，大家就不吊了。我思想，我不如人家杜宗山（自己是孤门小户），怕没有现洋就吃不开，故害怕就不坚决了。再，乔思从封了门没有斗，正要没收他，县教育科长孔占风就去了几封信，区长亦解释说乔曾是参议员，总算与群众走了一趟，因此没斗。大家泄了气，现在他还在满意，那时我是动摇。杜宗山是乔思从侄，有一天乔拿了一瓶酒，到杜宗山家，我跟着进去看他干啥，我一过去大门听乔说：“我去县府医务所，照顾我家一下。”我进屋，杜宗山说：我亲家送来东西，你说怎么办？我打不破情面，说放下吧，我也喝了二杯，思想喝了酒也不是我掩护他，是杜宗山掩护了他，那时我就忘了群众。
    分土地是先给军属分，其次是干部，再次才是贫雇。这时有些坏地分不下去，干部都说斗争彻底了，我也就动摇了，也以为斗透了。其实贫雇没翻透身，封建没斗透，这时还埋怨贫雇不要地，现在才认识不是贫雇不要地，是好地都给干部、军属拿走了，赖地当然贫雇不要了。检讨那时说斗彻底的是中富农和一部分吃饱了的干部。我自己也翻透了，有房有地有大车，思想就变了，忘了本了。
