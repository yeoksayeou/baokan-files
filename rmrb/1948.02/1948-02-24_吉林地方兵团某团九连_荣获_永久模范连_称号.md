Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th. The Ninth Company of a certain regiment of the Jilin Local Corps of the Jinan Military Region of the Jilin Military Region has not had any desertions in the past two years and was awarded the title of "Permanent Model Company" at the recent district hero model conference. The company, shortly after its establishment the year before last, withdrew from Chang(chun) Ji(lin) proactively along with our main force and transferred to Jinan. At that time, 80% of the area was occupied by the enemy. The entire Jinan base area had a population of only over 20,000, and the troops could only operate in the mountainous area of Huadian in Jiangdong. Everyone burned wild firewood and ate corn bran and vegetables, often camping in the open. In winter, before winter clothes were distributed, they were already damaged. Without money to buy thread, they could only sew with hemp rope or stuff *Lala* grass into their cotton trousers to keep warm. According to district statistics, the ratio of trauma to frostbite was one to fifteen. It was not until the summer and autumn offensives last year that the enemy was compressed in Jilin, Changchun, and Jinan, and the situation was opened up. The Ninth Company grew up in such a difficult environment and struggled against hundreds of times more enemies. At the beginning of the establishment of the Ninth Company, there were many problems. Individual soldiers visited women, ate and drank casually, said strange things, and other disciplinary violations. At that time, Instructor Jin Zhong treated these issues very seriously and cautiously. First, he strictly stipulated various systems, and a five-minute review meeting was held every night to review the day's learning and life, even small things were not relaxed. All management was the responsibility of the soldiers themselves, especially letting the naughty soldiers manage. If they didn't manage well, they would review at the review meeting. This gradually improved the soldiers' revolutionary self-esteem and sense of responsibility, and they began to establish a conscious obedience to discipline. In his work, Instructor Jin Zhong did the work of two people. Outside of work hours, he played games and talked with the soldiers. He knew the composition, background, history, personality, and specialties of every soldier in the company very clearly. If a soldier had a problem, he could quickly detect it and immediately conduct individual education. At the same time, all the activists in the company were united around him, and they educated the backward elements anytime and anywhere. Other cadres could also lead by example, letting the soldiers pick things first when distributing them. Everyone rushed to do all the work in the company, and the whole company was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship.

　　吉林地方兵团某团九连
  　荣获“永久模范连”称号
    【新华社东北十八日电】吉林军区吉南军分区地方兵团某团九连，两年来未曾发生逃亡现象，在最近分区英模大会上荣获“永久模范连”的称号。该连在前年成立不久，即随我军主力从长（春）吉（林）主动撤退，转入吉南，当时百分之八十的地区为敌侵占，整个吉南根据地只有两万多人口，部队仅能活动在江东桦甸一带山区，大家烧野柴，吃苞米糠菜，并经常露营，冬天没有过，棉衣便坏了，没有钱买线，只用麻绳子缝，或把＠拉草塞到棉裤里取暖。据分区统计：那时创伤与冻伤的比例为一比十五，直到去年夏秋攻势展开，敌人被压缩于吉林、长春、吉南局面才打开，九连就是在这样艰苦环境下，并与数百倍敌人斗争中生长起来的。九连建立之初，存在着很多毛病，个别战士逛女人、随便吃喝、说怪话及其他犯纪律的现象。当时指导员金钟非常严肃慎重地对待这些问题，首先严格规定了各种制度，每晚要召开五分钟的检讨会，检讨一天的学习与生活，甚至细小的事情也不放松。各种管理都让战士自己负责，特别让调皮的战士来管，管得不好便在检讨会上检讨，这样使战士的革命自尊心和责任心逐渐提高，开始建立自觉的服从纪律。在工作中，指导员金钟一个人顶上两个人干，在工作时间外，就和战士们一同游戏、谈话，对全连每个战士的成份出身、历史、个性、特长等都了解得非常清楚，某个战士发生问题，他能很快的发觉，并马上进行个别教育，同时全连的积极分子都团结在自己的周围，并通过他们随时随地教育落后分子。其他的干部们也都能以身作则，发东西时，尽先让战士们拣，连里一切工作都是大家抢着做，全连充满了团结友爱的空气。
