    The plummeting of prices and stock values in the United States is the major event that has rocked the world this week. Since the straight-line plunge in prices began on the 4th, the drop has been fierce. In just the first few days, the prices of general commodities fell by 15.5% compared to a month ago, and on the 13th, the wholesale prices of 35 commodities fell even further by 20.7%. By the 14th, some commodity prices had plummeted by as much as 30.9%. The speed of the fall in grain prices “has greatly exceeded that of 1929” (Associated Press). Stock and securities prices also plummeted at the same time, with losses of $3 billion in just one week. This economic "storm" in the United States has quickly affected other capitalist countries. Stock markets in the capitals and financial centers of Britain, Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Philippines, and Brazil have experienced "new waves of selling," with continuous and sharp declines in stocks and securities. At the same time, this news of falling prices is influencing the continued decline of securities on the American market.
    The main reason for the current sharp drop in prices in the United States is the profound contradiction between huge productive forces and a shrinking market. On the one hand, domestically, American capitalists, in order to extract higher profits, artificially raise prices, resulting in soaring prices. Food prices alone rose by almost 40% throughout last year, but real wages were greatly reduced. This has greatly reduced purchasing power. At the same time, the increasing poverty of the broad masses of the American people and the existence of eight million unemployed have further shrunk the domestic market. On the other hand, abroad, the vast majority of capitalist countries are in the midst of economic difficulties. They simply do not have, or lack, the dollar gold to purchase American goods. The shrinking domestic and foreign markets have made it impossible to sell large quantities of American goods, and inventories are piling up. According to the "American Economic Chronicle," inventories piled up in warehouses by the end of last year had reached $5 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion more than half a year earlier. This has led to a serious situation of overproduction.
    It must be pointed out that the plunge in prices and stocks in the United States is a signal of the American economic crisis. The famous Soviet economist Varga predicted as early as a year ago that "the outbreak of the American economic crisis will not be later than 1948." The current situation is even more obvious. It is no wonder that Wall Street bosses are "increasingly growing with fear, fearing that this is a prelude to a general and sharp economic downturn."
    Recently, several major events have also occurred in Southeast Asia. First, after the Communist Party of Burma established democratic regimes in central Burma and other places, it began a new wave of the national democratic movement of the Burmese people. Uprisings also occurred in the Karen areas of southern Burma last week. The mass revolutionary movements in many cities in the area, as well as the anti-tax and anti-rent struggles and armed activities of the vast number of peasants in central and southern Burma, are developing rapidly. Second, the people of South Korea have taken action to fight against the US imperialist plot to divide Korea. On the 7th alone, there were as many as 105 demonstrations, strikes, sabotage of railways, attacks on US-Korean outposts, warehouses, and other mass struggles in various parts of South Korea. It can be seen the scale and tenacity of the struggle. This is a serious counterattack against the vicious attempt by US imperialism to organize a puppet government in South Korea. Third, the situation in Indonesia has undergone tremendous changes. Under the pressure of the US imperialist so-called "mediation," the Indonesian government was forced to accept the Dutch terms on the cessation of hostilities and resolution of political disputes on the 17th of last month, and officially signed the humiliating "Renville Agreement," making Indonesia once again a US-Dutch colony; at the same time, the pro-American right-wing Hatta cabinet has been formed. However, although the upper echelons within Indonesia have compromised and signed the surrender document, the 70 million Indonesian people will never sign it! They will not stop fighting until they have completely shaken off the shackles of imperialism. The heroic actions of the Indonesian people in resolutely resisting the Dutch invading forces to this day are the best proof.
    Good news of the rising tide of the people's movement in Western Europe has continued to arrive like snowflakes in the past week. The Italian People's Democratic Front has launched a nationwide election campaign, and Italian youth, women, and people from all walks of life are further uniting to prepare all the necessary conditions for victory in the upcoming election showdown. The French working class held another national mass demonstration on the 8th, and the call to "defend peace and defend democracy" resounded throughout the country. In Britain, in order to save the deteriorating economic situation, the Labor government, with the support of US imperialism, brutally launched a fierce attack on the impoverished lives of British workers, announcing that it would freeze workers' wages at the current level. This reactionary offensive has aroused sharp protests from the British working class. The National Union of Railwaymen with 759,000 members, the Electrical Trades Union, the Civil Service Association, and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions with 2.75 million members have unanimously rejected this reactionary policy and declared that they will launch a wage increase struggle. At the same time, this reactionary measure has also caused divisions within the Labor Party, with 20 Labor MPs expressing their opposition. The foundation of the Labor government is becoming increasingly weakened.

### 美英等国经济起了大风波  东方人民运动掀起新浪潮

    美英等国经济起了大风波
    东方人民运动掀起新浪潮
    美国物价和股票价格的暴跌，这是本周轰动世界的大事。物价从四日开始直线般的暴跌以来，至今跌风猛烈。仅开头数天，一般商品价格较一个月前下跌了百分之十五点五，十三日的三十五种商品批发价格更下跌百分之二十点七，至十四日，有些商品价格竟狂跌达百分之三十点九。粮食价格暴跌速度“已大大超过了一九二九年”（合众社）。股票证券价格亦同时暴跌，一周中即因下跌而损失三十亿美元之巨。这次美国的经济“大风暴”，已迅速影响到其他资本主义国家，英、澳、加、丹麦、菲律滨、巴西等国首都及若干金融中心的股票市场，发生了“新的抛售浪潮”，股票证券都连续狂跌。同时，这一跌价消息又影响美国市场证券的继续跌落。
    美国此次物价狂跌的主要原因，是由于庞大生产力与日益缩小的市场之间发生了深刻的矛盾。一方面在国内，美国大资本家为了榨取更高利润，因此人工地抬高物价，结果便百物飞涨，去年全年食物价格几已上涨百分之四十，但实际工资则大为减低。这就大大降低了购买力；同时美国广大人民的日益贫困，和八百万失业者的存在，使国内市场更趋缩小。另一方面，在国外，绝大多数资本主义国家都处于经济困难的苦海中，它们根本没有或缺乏美元黄金购买美货。国内外市场的日益狭小，使大批美货卖不出去，存货堆积如山。据“美国经济纪要”的材料，到去年底堆积在仓库里的存货，已达五百万万美元，较半年前激增了一百五十万万美元之多。因此形成了生产过剩的严重情况。
    必须指出：美国物价与股票的暴跌，乃是美国经济危机的信号，苏联名经济学家瓦尔加早在一年前即已预计：“美国经济危机的爆发，将不会迟于一九四八年”，现在的情况是更加明显了。这难怪华尔街的老板们要“普遍增长着恐惧心，害怕这是经济普遍急转直下的前奏了”。
    最近东南亚亦发生了几件重大事件。其一，缅甸共产党自在缅甸中部等地成立民主政权后，开始了缅甸人民民族民主运动的新浪潮。上周南缅卡伦等区也发生起义，该区许多城市的群众革命运动，以及中缅南缅一带广大农民的抗捐抗租斗争与武装活动，正日益展开中。其二、南鲜人民已行动起来，为反抗美帝分裂朝鲜的阴谋活动而斗争了。仅七日一天内，南鲜各地便发生了示威、罢工、破坏铁轨、袭击美韩哨岗、仓库及其他群众斗争事件达一百另五起。可以看出斗争的规模和顽强性。这对美帝组织南鲜傀儡政府的恶毒企图，是一个严重的反击。其三、印尼局势已发生巨变。在美帝所谓“调处”的压力下，印尼政府被迫于上月十七日接受了荷兰关于停战与解决政治纠纷条款，正式签订了屈辱的“伦维尔协定”，使印尼重新沦为美荷的殖民地；同时，亲美右派哈达内阁已经组成。但是，印尼内部的上层分子虽妥协而在投降书上签字了，七千万印尼人民决不会签字！它们不达到完全挣脱帝国主义枷锁的目的，是不会停止战斗的。印尼人民至今仍坚决反抗荷兰侵犯军的英勇行动，便是最好的证明。
    西欧人民运动高涨的佳讯，一周来继续如雪片般飞来。意大利人民民主阵线展开了全国性的竞选运动，意青年妇女及各阶层人民正进一步团结起来，为未来大选的决斗准备一切必胜的条件。法国工人阶级八日又举行了全国群众大示威，“保卫和平保卫民主”的呼声响遍全国。在英国，工党政府为了挽救越趋恶化的经济形势，在美帝的支持下，竟残暴地向英国工人的贫困生活发动猛攻，宣布将职工工资固定于目前的水平。这一反动攻势引起了英国工人阶级的尖锐抗议，具有七十五万九千会员的全国铁路工人工会、电气职工会、公务员协会，及拥有二百七十五万会员的造船与机械工会联合会等职工会，一致拒斥这一反动政策，并声言即将发动增资斗争。同时，这一反动措施亦引起了工党内部的分歧，二十名工党议员已表示反对。工党政府的基础是愈来愈削弱了。
