The local armed forces of the Fourth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan
Eliminate 1,400 Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Society Members
Liberated Personnel Treated According to the Policy of Leniency and Education

[Our News] The local armed forces of the Fourth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in four days from the 7th to the 10th, resolved over 1,400 reactionary society armed members organized by Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Qia He area of Fengqiu, northern Henan, killing or wounding 506 of them, capturing 947, and seizing 3 light machine guns, 49 rifles, 5 pistols, and a number of spears. These societies were organized under the direction of Wang Sanzhu, the joint defense commander of Hua (County), Feng (Qiu), and Yan (Jin) counties, and became a tool for Chiang Kai-shek bandits against the people in northern Henan. Our armed forces of the Fourth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, therefore, completely resolved them at the beginning of the month. Since the majority of the society members were forced or induced by superstition to participate, our army, after liberating them, adhered to the policy of leniency and education. As long as they no longer serve as tools for Chiang Kai-shek bandits against the people, they were released to return home and join the peasants in overturning the old order and distributing land.

[Taihang News] In Yexian and Taigu in Taihang, the local armed forces, combined with a part of the main force, actively intercepted and attacked the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops, eliminating over a hundred enemies in two battles and capturing Guanjia Fort. On the 19th of this month, two companies of the pseudo-bandit "Henan People's Self-Defense Second Detachment" under Guo Qing, stationed in Tian Lichangtun, Yexian County, advanced towards Dafotun. Our Yexian County battalion bravely met the attack and repelled the enemy after an hour of fierce fighting, eliminating a part of them. A total of 62 enemy soldiers, including company commander Wang Fushou, were captured alive, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and one machine gun, 67 rifles and pistols, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. A part of the main force of the Second Sub-district, on the 11th, our army in Taigu proactively went deep behind enemy lines, attacking Guanjia Fort and Nansha River, five miles south of Taigu City, capturing the Guanjia Fort stronghold in one fell swoop, eliminating 25 Yan Xishan bandits, including 18 captured alive. Five rifles, over forty rounds of ammunition, and four bayonets were seized.

[Taiyue News] The Second Demolition Squad of the First District of Pingyao went deep into the guerrilla areas of Yuanjiazhuang, Xianrenqiao, and other places to carry out demolition guerrilla warfare. On February 1st, the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan Xishan bandits stationed in Xier, coordinated with over a hundred members of the pseudo-Piancheng Township team, launched a sudden attack on Yuanjiazhuang. When over twenty people advanced towards our Jiulonggou and passed through Xianrenqiao, the township head of the Yan Xishan bandits was instantly blown to death with a loud bang, four were seriously injured, and one submachine gun and two rifles were damaged. The Yan Xishan bandits were so frightened that they dared not move forward and returned crestfallen.
