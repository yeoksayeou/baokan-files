The newspaper serves land reform
    Some provinces publish newspapers specifically about land reform. The "Land Reform Bulletin" of Leszno is particularly well edited. Technical guidance, political encouragement, and farmer correspondence are mixed and arranged. It explains "how to divide the land" in simple language. Farmers should start with the county representatives and organize their own committees, "seven to eleven people, honest and knowledgeable about the land... democratically elected and responsible for reporting to the whole village."

    "Instructions to the Committee" are equally clear and concise. They must register the property of the estates and prevent looting. Surveying the land must be done by surveyors; if there are no surveyors, let farmers familiar with this work do it. Boundary demarcation must be accurate and fair, but should take into account the convenience of farming and the orientation of roads. If an applicant's son has not yet joined the army, he should be sent to the nearest recruitment location. "Whoever is unwilling to fight for the land of Poland has no right to the land." The instructions conclude: "When the whole village believes that the distribution is fair, the division should be implemented immediately."

    This newspaper is already advocating a new concept of property. Yesterday, land and livestock belonged to the landlords; today, if a landlord secretly gives a chicken to his friend, he is a thief, and the newspaper will announce his theft. "Landlords are harming the property of the peasants! The police must investigate! The female owner of Szulczynski Manor has given livestock to her relatives... The landlord of Gumminsy Manor is driving livestock out... The female landlord of Zalisy has taken away thirteen cows... Farmers! Can't you get those livestock back?"...

Land Reform Promotes the War Towards Victory

    Why launch such a complex land reform during the war?

    These years when the war is approaching victory are the easiest time to carry out reforms. The absence of many large landlords (because some were killed by the German invaders and some fled with the German invaders) created an economic gap that must be quickly filled by new owners to cultivate the land. ...

    In addition, land reform has its significant military and political reasons. The large estates of the landlords are often centers of reactionary politics. Under the new regime, they become dens of terrorist gangs, assassinating civil and military officials. Conversely, the farmers who have become new landowners are the pillars of the new regime and a natural source of soldiers for the new Polish army.

    Land reform is awakening the Polish countryside; it has launched strong popular support for the new regime and a surge of voluntary enlistment. It enables millions of farmers to understand concretely, according to statistics, their reasons for demanding East Prussia and Pomerania (places in the past where Germany invaded and occupied Poland, East Prussia in northern Poland, Pomerania in western Poland, now all belonging to Poland - Editor). Therefore, although land reform is so complex, it has not distracted from the war effort. It is creating a new force for the march on Berlin! (Later, along with the Soviet Red Army hitting Berlin, there were Polish troops. - Editor)

Celebration of Land Returning Home

    In every county, people hang flags, play music, and sing the national anthem, holding grand celebrations. Polish soldiers salute whenever the government awards land deeds to farmers. I, along with Vice Minister of Agriculture Bieniek, attended the celebration in the town of Raciąż, which is just one of the celebrations commonly held in various towns.

    We walked through the market to the auditorium in the park. The crowd was flowing in like water. The auditorium is a rectangular, ordinary building, built a long time ago, with no decorations. Two young Polish soldiers, armed, stood on either side of the door, like two pillars. When Bieniek approached, they stood at attention and saluted. At this time, it seemed that someone had given a signal, because as we entered the door, the band in the auditorium began to play the national anthem to welcome us.

    Then, the dense crowd suddenly and magically separated to both sides, leaving a passage straight to the stage—facing the red and white Polish flag and the dark green Christmas tree on the stage. Bieniek, like Santa Claus, was about to award deeds to farmers for 30,000 acres of land to those in attendance.

    The county land commissioner began reporting statistics on land reform. Nearly five thousand households in Raciąż County received land. There were two thousand one hundred and sixty-two former farm laborers and landless peasants, each receiving an average of nine acres. There were two thousand six hundred and eighty-five farm families who previously had less than five acres of land, each receiving an average of four acres. A natural cheer erupted from the venue, and everyone clearly knew the land they deserved.

    Then, everyone sat down and listened quietly to the report that should be given at such a gathering. ...

Uncovering a Slab of Stone from a Thousand Years Ago

    Bieniek reported on the thousand-year struggle of Polish farmers, and the eyes of the masses were focused on him. He said that the land struggle was part of their long-term struggle for an independent and strong Poland. The landlords were constantly selling out their national interests for their own feudal privileges; this is the lesson of history. ...

    The speaker concluded: "Farmers have been waiting for generations for this day when the Polish land is distributed by their own farmers' committees. What you have received is not just land, but the foundation of an independent and strong Poland. Kościuszko said: 'Only free farmers can build a strong and free country.' Today we have laid the foundation for the freedom of our country."

    The rough faces of the farmers under sheepskin hats and thick scarves looked particularly tense at this time. They listened to Bieniek's report, listening to the history of Polish farmers from the Piast dynasty to modern times, and did not feel the sub-zero cold. They were nodding seriously, affirming their destiny, the nine acres of land they received today made them a part of history.

    After a while, a burst of cheers suddenly shook the venue. A young military officer walked to the stage, wearing a military uniform with a "Polish Eagle" badge on his hat.

    "Someone told you that taking land is dangerous," he said directly: "They said that the London Poles (the Polish reactionary government was in exile in London at that time - Editor) will come and take the land away and punish you. But you now have an army, and I can tell you that it is a new army. The old army was led by the sons of landlords and gentry as officials, and they used it to suppress the peasant movement. Our new army loves farmers and protects the interests of farmers. In this new army, the sons of farmers can be promoted to officers."

    "The land deed you received today is guaranteed by the bayonets of our new democratic Polish army."

    His speech caused a sensation in the entire venue.

    波兰的土地改革（续完）
    斯特朗作
    李棣华译
    报纸为土地改革服务
    有的省份出版专门关于土地改革的报纸。莱苏的“土地改革公报”编辑得特别好。技术指导，政治鼓励，和农民通讯掺和起来编排着。用简单的文字解释“怎样分田”。农民们应该先同县代表一块作起，组织自己的委员会，“七人至十一人，忠实而且了解土地情况……民主选出，负责对全村汇报。”
    “对于委员会的指示”也是同样的简单明了。他们必须登记田庄的财产，防止掠夺。丈量土地一定要让测量员作；如果没有测量员的话，就让熟习这种工作的农民去作。划界必须准确公道，但要照顾到农作的便利和道路的方位。申请人的儿子如果还没有参军的话，应该送他们到最靠近的征募新兵地点。“谁不愿意为波兰的土地而斗争，谁就对土地没有权利。”指示结束说：“当全村认为分配已经公道的时候，应该立刻实行划分。”
    这个报纸已经在倡导着一种新的财产观念。昨天，土地和牲畜是属于地主的；今天，如果地主鬼带一只鸡给他的朋友的话，他就是贼，报纸就要宣布他的盗窃行为。“地主们正在断害农民的财产呢！警察必须查究！斯劳赛尼的女庄主把牲口给了她的亲戚了……古明斯基的地主在往外赶牲畜……扎利苏的女地主已经牵出去十三头牛了……农民们！你们不能把那些牲畜找回来么？”………
    土地改革推进战争走向胜利
    为什么在战争当中发动这样复杂的土地改革呢？
    这个战争接近胜利的年月，正是进行改革最容易的时候。许多大地主的缺席（这是因为有的被德寇杀了，有的跟德寇一块逃跑了），造成了一个经济上的空隙，必须很快找到新主来耕种土地。……
    此外，土地改革有它重大的军事和政治理由的。地主们的大田庄经常是反动政治的中心。在新政权的下面，它们便成为恐怖分子帮会的巢穴，暗杀文武官员。相反的，新作了土地主人的农民们却是新政权的支柱，也是新波兰军的自然兵源。
    土地改革正在唤醒着波兰乡村；它发动了人民对于新政权的大力支持和自愿参军热潮。它使得千百万农民，根据统计数字，具体了解到他们要求东普鲁士和波美拉尼亚（是过去德国侵占波兰的地方，东普鲁士在波兰北部，波美拉尼亚在波兰西部，现在都已归波兰所有了。——编者）的理由。所以，土地改革虽然那样的复杂，却并没有分散了作战努力。它是正在创造向柏林大进军的新生力量呢！（后来，随着苏联红军打到柏林的，正有着波兰人的军队。——编者）
    庆祝土地还家的大会
    在每个县里，人民悬着旗，奏着乐，唱着国歌，在开隆重的庆祝大会。波兰的士兵们，每当政权把地契授给农民的时候，便行礼致敬。我跟农业部副部长毕涅克参加了拉左县城的庆祝大会，这不过是各城镇所普遍举行的大会之一罢了。
    我们步行过市场，到达了公园里的会堂。群众正在象水流一般往里走。会堂是个长方形的平常建筑，很久以前修造的，没有什么装饰。两个年青的波兰兵，带着武器，站在门的两边，好象两根柱石似的。当毕涅克走近的时候，他们便立正敬礼。这时，好象有人发出了信号，因为正当我们进门的时候，会堂里的乐队便奏起国歌来欢迎我们。
    接着，密集的人群忽然很神奇地向两旁分开，中间空出一条直达主席台的行道——正对着台上的红白波兰国旗和深绿的圣诞树。毕涅克，好象圣诞老人一样，正要授给到会农民三万英亩土地的地契。
    县土地特派员开始报告土地改革的统计数字。在拉左县将近五千户人家得到土地。有二千一百六十二户是以往的雇农和无地的农民，每户平均得到九英亩。有二千六百八十五户是以往只有不到五英亩地的农家，每户平均得到四英亩。会场发出了自然的欢呼，每人都清楚应得的土地。
    于是，大家便安坐下来，静听在这样集会里应有的报告。………
    揭掉了千年以来的石板
    毕涅克报告千年以来的波兰农民斗争，群众的目光都集中到他身上。他说，土地斗争是他们为了独立强盛的波兰的长期斗争的一部分。地主们为了他们本身的封建特权，无时不在出卖他们的国家利益；这就是历史教训。………
    讲演的人作出这样的结论：“农民们辈辈等待着这个由农民自己的委员会分配波兰土地的日子。你们所得到的并不仅仅是土地，而是波兰独立强盛的基础。高苏斯哥说过：‘只有自由的农民才能建立强盛自由的国家。’我们今天已经打下了我们国家自由的基础了。”
    在羊皮帽子和大毛围巾底下的粗实的农民的脸，这时显得分外紧张。他们听着毕涅克的报告，听着从比埃斯特王朝一直到现代的波兰农民的历史，决没有感到零下的严寒。他们很严肃地在点头，肯定了他们的命运，他们今天所得到的九英亩土地使他们成了历史的一部分。
    停了一会儿，一阵欢呼声，忽然在会场震荡起来。一个青年军官走到台前，穿着军服，头上有个“波兰之鹰”的帽徽。
    “有人告诉你们说拿土地很危险，”他直接了当地说：“他们说，伦敦波兰人（波兰反动政府当时流亡在伦敦——编者）会来拿走土地，惩罚你们的。但是，你们现在有了一支军队了，而且，我可以对你们说，这是一支新军。旧军是地主士绅的子弟们当官带领，被他们用来镇压农民运动的。我们的新军爱护农民，保护农民利益。在这支新军当中，农民子弟是能升作军官的。”
    “今天你们所得到的地契，是被我们的新民主波兰军的刺刀所保证的。”
    他的演说轰动了全场。
