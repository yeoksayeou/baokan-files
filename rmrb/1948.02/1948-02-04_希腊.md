    Greece
    Asia, Europe, and Africa surround a large body of water, which is the Mediterranean Sea. On the northern shore of the Mediterranean, three peninsulas jut out like legs of land into the water. The easternmost leg is the Balkan Peninsula, and the tip of the peninsula is Greece. Its neighbors are Albania to the northwest, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast.
    Greece is a small place, about the size of Fujian Province in China, with a small population of only seven million. It is mountainous, and the wheat produced is almost enough for domestic consumption. Tobacco leaves, olive oil, and fruits are produced in large quantities. Industry is limited to cigarette factories, flour mills, and wine-making factories.
    Don't look down on this small place. Because of it, many United Nations meetings have been noisy and heated. The United States and Britain want to oppose the Soviet Union, so they want to create an "anti-Soviet circle" along the northern coast of the Mediterranean, through Turkey, into the Near East, and out to India. However, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania in the north are all New Democratic countries, which the United States is very jealous of. If it wants to invade, it must first occupy Greece and turn it into its own lackey, and then use this Balkan gateway to rob things from inside the house.
    How could the Greek people go along with these robbers? Greece is such a glorious nation! In ancient times, Greek literature, art, philosophy, science... achieved the highest achievements. Greek civilization is the mother of Western civilization and has made great contributions to world culture. Later, it was invaded and ruled by other nations. But the Greek people have always fought for national liberation. In 1830, Greece was considered independent, but the country was still weak and relied on Britain and France.
    During World War II, the fascist leader Mussolini sent troops to invade it. This small country defeated the Italian army miserably, which alarmed Hitler, who quickly mobilized German troops to help fight, using paratrooper forces to occupy Greece. However, the Greek people did not surrender. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they organized the People's Liberation Front and the People's Liberation Army to fight a guerrilla war against the German army. They fought heroically for more than three years, cooperating with the British landing, and completely liberated Greece. However, after the British troops landed, they brought the exiled government of the fascist royalists to power. British General Scobie used rockets and tanks to confiscate most of the People's Liberation Army's weapons and stayed in Greece. That was the "Scobie" policy that was often talked about earlier.
    The Greek reactionnary government gained a foothold, and arrested and massacred the people, causing lawlessness. The people then rose up in resistance and fought a guerrilla war against it. At first, the guerrilla force had only 9,000 people. The reactionary government looked down on the power of the people and shouted wildly: "Completely annihilate the guerrilla force in two weeks!" It also said: "Attack Belgrade (the capital of Yugoslavia)! Attack Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria)!" However, although the reactionary government had more than 170,000 troops, it could not defeat the Greek Democratic Army guerrilla force. Unable to do anything, it spread rumors that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania were helping the Greek guerrillas. The United States and Britain also supported the Greek reactionary government in the United Nations, saying that it was necessary to investigate in order to fish in troubled waters and invade the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. They then passed a resolution in the United Nations to send an investigation team to Greece.
    The Greek reactionary government, having suffered defeats, cried for help from the United States, selling 220,000 acres of Thracian lead mines to the United States.
    Britain, because it did not have the strength to support the Greek reactionary government and suppress the people's movement, ceded its position to the United States. In order to implement the Truman Doctrine and invade Greece, the United States helped the Greek reactionary government with a lot of money and weapons. After the United Nations investigation team returned, the United States falsely claimed in the Security Council: "Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are helping the Greek guerrillas fight the Greek government," and demanded the establishment of a Balkan border monitoring group to freely go to Balkan countries to "investigate" and "reconcile." The Soviet Union criticized the United States, opposed this approach, and said that foreign countries should not interfere in Greece, and that the Greek people should manage their country well, so that Greece could be independent and democratic, and have good relations with its neighbors. Yugoslavia and other countries also agreed with this view.
    Last summer, the Greek Democratic Army launched an offensive across the country, attacking the capital Athens, and once reached a place thirty miles from Athens. The United States became anxious and sent military officers to help command the Greek government army. It also spent 160 million US dollars to appoint an American as the president of the Greek bank; the Greek reactionary government sold all its economic sovereignty to its American father. However, the reactionary faction was not stable internally. Last year, the reactionary government's expenses were in deficit by 400 million US dollars, and there were 30,000 people in Athens who went on strike to oppose the reactionary government. On the other hand, the Greek Democratic Army and the liberated areas were growing stronger day by day. Last October, it had an army of 170,000 people, as well as an air force. In November, the headquarters of the Democratic Army established an internal affairs committee to consolidate and expand the liberated areas. The Democratic Army helped farmers produce, and confiscated the property of fleeing landlords and merchants to open schools. Farmers also actively participated in and helped the Democratic Army. Farmers in places such as Chrisou village also organized self-defense forces to cooperate with the Democratic Army in combat. In some places, farmers voluntarily handed in public grain, and also said that they would work hard to produce more grain to support the front line. By December last year, the Greek Democratic Army had controlled two-thirds of the country's territory.
    As the Greek Democratic Army and the liberated areas grew rapidly, the United States became even more anxious, and raised the past Balkan issue again for discussion at the United Nations General Assembly, organizing its capitalist lackey countries to raise their hands to pass the establishment of a "Balkan Special Committee." At the same time, it ousted the royalists and called for the Liberal Party's Sophoulis to become prime minister, trying to deceive the Greek people. It also established a "U.S.-Greece Joint Chiefs of Staff for the Army, Navy, and Air Force," with an American as the chief of staff, directly commanding the reactionary government army in combat.
    However, the United States' artillery and money could not save the life of the Greek traitorous government after all. The Provisional People's Democratic Government of the Greek Liberated Area was established on the 24th of last month, and issued a declaration to the Greek people. Premier General Markos (a Communist Party member) also issued a New Democratic program, which proposed to liberate Greece from the oppression of American and British imperialism and its Greek running dogs, to handle national affairs by the people's democracy, to nationalize all foreign large enterprises, large banks, and heavy industries in Greece, to implement land reform, to give equal status to ethnic minorities, and to restore diplomatic relations with all countries, especially to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe. Recently, the Greek Democratic Army has launched a strong offensive on all fronts. Premier General Markos also issued an order, calling on the Greek people and the Democratic Army to strengthen the struggle against the enemy, overcome difficulties, and strive for final victory.

    希腊
    亚洲、欧洲、非洲三块大陆围着一大片水，那便是地中海。地中海的北岸，有三个半岛象陆地的腿，伸到水里。最东边的一条腿，就是巴尔干半岛，半岛的尖端就是希腊。它的邻国，西北是阿尔巴尼亚，正北是南斯拉夫和保加利亚，东北是土耳其。
    希腊地方很小，只有我国福建省那么大小，人口不多，只有七百万。山多，出产的麦子差不多够本国吃，烟叶、橄榄油、果品出的多，工业只有卷烟磨面做葡萄酒等工厂。
    可别看不起这个小地方。为了它，联合国许多次会议上，曾经吵闹得脸红脖子粗。美国和英国要反对苏联，就想沿着地中海北岸，经过土耳其入近东，出印度，划成“反苏圈”的一部分，可是，北边的南斯拉夫、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚，都是新民主主义国家，美国看了很眼红，要想去侵略，总得先占住希腊叫它变成自己的走狗，再从这个巴尔干的门口，到屋里去抢东西。
    希腊人民那里就会顺着这些强盗呢？希腊是多么光荣的民族！古时，希腊的文学、艺术、哲学、科学………，成就最高。希腊的文明是西方文明的母亲，并且给世界文化伟大的贡献，以后，它就被别的民族侵略和统治了。但希腊人民还是一直为民族解放而斗争，到一八三○年希腊算是独立了，可是国家还是很弱，依靠英法。
    这次世界大战，法西斯头子墨索里尼派兵去侵略它，这小小的国家却把意大利军队打的落花流水，急坏了希特勒，赶快调动德国军队去帮打，使用起降落伞部队来，才把希腊占领了。可是，希腊人民并没有屈服，他们在共产党领导下组织人民解放阵线和人民解放军和德国军队打起游击战来，英勇奋斗了三年多，配合英军登陆，全部解放了希腊。可是英国军队登陆后，把法西斯保皇党的流亡政府带来登上宝殿，英国将军斯科比使用起火箭炮坦克车，把人军解放军的枪大部分缴了，而且还在希腊住下不走。那就是早先常讲的“斯科比”政策。
    希腊反动政府站住脚，就抓捕屠杀人民，闹的无法无天，人民便又起来反抗，和它打游击队。开头游击队只有九千人，反动政府看不起人民力量，狂叫：两个礼拜全部歼灭游击队！又说：打到伯尔格莱德（南斯拉夫的京城）去！打到索菲亚（保加利亚的京城）去！可是，反动政府虽然有十七万多兵，却打不过希腊民主军游击队。没办法，便造谣说南斯拉夫、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚帮助希腊游击队。美国英国也在联合国给希腊反动政府帮腔，说需要调查一下，好混水摸鱼，去侵略巴尔干半岛的国家，便在联合国通过派调查团到希腊去。
    希腊反动政府吃了败仗，哭着要美国来帮忙，把二十二万亩的色雷斯铅矿出卖给美国。
    英国因为没有力量支持希腊反动政府，压住人民运动，便让位给美国，而美国为了着手实行杜鲁门主义，向希腊侵略，就帮助了希腊反动政府许多金钱和武器，联合国调查团回来后，安全理事会上，美国就胡赖说：“南斯拉夫、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚帮助希腊游击队打希腊政府”，要求成立巴尔干边境监视团，自由到巴尔干各国去“调查”和“和解”。苏联批评了美国，反对这种做法，说外国不应该干涉希腊，由希腊的人民把国家治理好，使希腊能够独立和民主，和邻国要好。南斯拉夫等国也同意这种意见。
    去年夏天，希腊民主军在全国发动攻势，向京城雅典进攻，曾打到离雅典三十里的地方。美国急了，就派军官帮助指挥希腊政府军，还花了一万六千万美金，派美国人当希腊的银行总裁；希腊反动政府就把一切经济主权卖给它美国爸爸了。可是反动派内部并不稳固，去年反动政府经费亏到四万万美金，雅典还有过三万人罢工反对反动政府。另一方面，希腊民主军和解放区却一天天壮大了，去年十月有军队十七万人，还有空军。十一月民主军总部成立内政委员会，巩固和扩大解放区，民主军帮助农民生产，并没收逃亡大地主大商人的财产，来开办学校，农民也积极参加和帮助民主军，克里苏村等地的农民还组织自卫队，配合民主军作战。有些地方农民自动交公粮，还说要努力生产多打粮食支援前线。到去年十二月，希腊民主军已经控制全国领土三分之二了。
    希腊民主军和解放区很快壮大起来，美国更着急了，便在联合国大会上还把过去巴尔干的事又提出来讨论，组织它的资本主义喽罗国家举手通过成立“巴尔干特别委员会”，同时又把保皇党拉下台，叫自由党索福利斯出来当总理，想来欺骗希腊人民，还成立“美希海陆空军联合参谋部”，由美国人当参谋长，直接指挥反动政府军作战。
    可是，美国的大炮和金钱到底救不了希腊卖国政府的命，希腊解放区临时人民民主政府，已经在上月二十四日成立，并向希腊人民发表宣言，总理马科斯将军（共产党员）还发表了新民主主义的施政纲领，都提出要把希腊从美英帝国主义和它的希腊走狗的压迫下解放出来，国家大事由人民民主来办，一切外国在希腊的大企业、大银行和重工业归国家所有，实行土地改革，给少数民族平等地位，和一切国家恢复外交关系，特别要和苏联及东欧新民主国家建立友好的邦交。最近，希腊民主军在各线又发动了强大攻势，总理马科斯将军并下命令，号召希腊人民及民主军，加强对敌斗争，克服困难，争取最后胜利。  （曾文经）
