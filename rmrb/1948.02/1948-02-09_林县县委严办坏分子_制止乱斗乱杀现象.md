[Taihang News] The Lin County Party Committee is severely punishing bad elements and resolutely stopping the random beatings and killings occurring in a few villages. According to investigations, from December of last year (1947) to the present, a total of twelve people have died in the county. In Nan Jingse Village, five people died in the "anti-special agent" campaign, including four rich peasants and one upper-middle peasant. Two people died in struggles in Guo Jia Zhuang, one a middle peasant and the other's class status unknown. In Qian Jia Zhuang, two women died, one a middle peasant who hanged herself because she had an illegitimate child, and the other a landlord's wife who hanged herself because she had not divorced. In Mian Jiao Jiao, a rich peasant woman hanged herself because she had not divorced. In Zhai Di, a middle peasant woman hanged herself fearing she would be denounced as a "broken shoe" (promiscuous woman). In Lu Jia Zhuang, a middle peasant died, but the cause is still unclear. The villages involved in struggle sessions include Nan Jingse, Bei Jingse, Nan Lingyang, Nihetou, Tian Jia Jing, Ma An Shan, Guo Jia Zhuang, and seven others. The harms of random beatings and killings were examined at an expanded cadre meeting on the 18th of last month, and three village cadres and one district cadre were punished (another is serving at the front). The detailed situation is as follows:

    In Nan Jingse, two district cadres, knowing full well what they were doing, led the "anti-special agent" campaign. Qin Yucheng (secretary of the branch committee) thought: "Our work in Nan Jingse has always been good," and was somewhat complacent. Under his personal heroism, he believed, "If I commit a mistake, I'll just get criticized at most." At the same time, he suspected that special agents wanted to shoot him in the back and considered other village cadres to be "rightist." Thus, through a few individuals and cadres, Li Yaolun (upper-middle peasant) was detained, without the knowledge of some of the masses. Under coercion, Li implicated many people. Under the pressure of Qin and others, Dong Yushu (middle peasant), Li Lushan (rich peasant), and five others died.

    In Nan Lingyang Village, cadres, when handling burdens, privately fined fifteen families (two families of runaway soldiers, one family for raising pigeons, one family for running away, and some poor peasants), totaling 9,009 jin of grain, claiming it was to reduce the burden on the whole village and the poor peasants, but in reality, it was for the cadres to contribute less themselves. Due to bureaucratic leadership and a lack of in-depth understanding of the hired and poor peasants, this matter was previously unknown.

    In production, the county emphasized solving the production funds of the hired and poor peasants. The village cadres then organized a carpentry shop, calling for turning dead assets into living things. Those who didn't have money could contribute trees. They forced the entire village and threatened middle peasants to contribute trees at low prices. For example, Zhang Baoquan's eight trees were valued at only 25,000 yuan (barely the price of one tree). Most of the trees in the village were tagged, and middle peasants wept secretly, feeling dissatisfied with the hired and poor peasants being helped. A total of 214 trees were sawed down (from 35 households), including five rich peasant households, nine upper-middle peasant households, fourteen middle peasant households, and seven poor peasant households. This caused fear among all classes, and everything was sawed open, creating contradictions and confusion among middle and poor peasants, leaving loopholes for landlords to exploit. The most serious problem was the group led by Liang Changhui, director of the armed forces committee. Liang Changhui's separation of property from the landlord in the past was unclear. Now, wanting to win over the hired and poor peasants to cover himself, he appointed Zhang Laigui, a sixteen-year-old penniless child, as the leader of the hired and poor peasant group. Zhang took a measuring cup and went to middle peasant homes to borrow grain and eat at random. In one village, he forcibly "volunteered" to borrow 180,000 yuan to help the hired and poor peasants, and no one dared to complain. This actually insulted the hired and poor peasants, making them bear the burden of the name, isolating them.

    Li Hengchang, the political director of Guo Jia Zhuang, was usually corrupt and embezzled in the village, and the masses had many opinions about him, but dared not speak out. This time, he led a few people to struggle against the landlord, forcing two to death.

    After discussion, it was believed that these villages violated the instructions of the higher authorities, violated the Land Law, and violated the demands of the masses – to lead production. Only a few people were engaged in random struggles divorced from the masses, creating contradictions and confusion within the peasantry, and harming the hired and poor peasants. This could not be allowed to continue. Therefore, it was decided to detain Liang Shenghui, Qin Yucheng, Fu Qiyuan, and Li Hengchang by the government, pending future investigation (Hao Dacheng went to the front and has not returned). These punishments were announced at the cadre meetings of all districts and villages in the county. The punished district cadres were detained on the spot. The village cadres were dealt with at the district cadre meeting and then sent to the county.

    At the expanded cadre meeting, it was strictly forbidden to have such illegal behavior again, otherwise, it would be severely punished. It was also clarified that the current focus is on winter production and the publicity of the Land Law Outline, with the following specific regulations:

    1. Stop class demarcation. If production needs to solve the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants, the masses of the entire village can discuss who really has difficulties and then solve them. Because at this time, class demarcation is neither accurate on one side nor clear on the other, dragging out the time and affecting mass production. It will be demarcated after the distribution begins.

    2. Resolutely return the funds of the middle peasants and those who have been struggled against in disguise. The method of return is: return the funds that have not been lent to the hired and poor peasants. If the hired and poor peasants are using these funds for production, they can be returned first from the village finance and the fruits of struggle. The hired and poor peasants will return the fruits of struggle and the village finance when they are due, so as not to make one mistake after another.

    3. If there are landlords and bad elements who violate the Land Law Outline by transferring property, resolutely send them to the government for detention, pending disposal during distribution. The facts can be widely discussed and educated among the masses, and the property sold by them can be confiscated by the peasant association, preserved and registered, and disposed of during distribution.

    林县县委严办坏分子
    制止乱斗乱杀现象
    【太行消息】林县县委严厉惩办坏分子，坚决制止少数村乱斗、乱杀现象。据检查去年（四七年）十二月到现在，全县共死了十二个人。南景色村反特务，死了五个，内四个富农、一个上中农。郭家庄斗争死了两个，一个中农，另一成份不知。前家庄两个妇女，一个是中农，因有私生子吊死的；一个是地主妇女，因未离了婚吊死的。面交角一个富农妇女，因没离了婚吊死了。寨底一个中农妇女，怕斗破鞋吊死了。路家庄死了一个中农，原因还未查清。搞斗争村，有南景色、北景色、南陵阳、逆河头、田家井、马安山、郭家庄等七个村。在上月十八日扩大干部会上检讨了乱斗、乱杀的危害，并处分了三个村干部和一个区干部（另一个在前方参战），详细情况如下：
    南景色是两个区干部领导着明知故犯反特务的。秦玉成（分委）的思想是：我南景色工作一贯不错，有些自满，而在个人英雄主义下，认为“犯就犯了，顶多挨顿批评”，同时疑心特务想打自己黑枪；又认为其他村干部“右”。于是经过少数分子和干部，将李耀轮扣起来（上中农），有些群众并不知道。李在逼迫下，咬出许多人。在秦等追逼下死了董玉树（中农）、李禄山（富农）等五个人。
    南陵阳村干部在办负担时，私自罚了十五家（两家逃亡战士、一家因养鸽子、一家因逃跑、还有些贫农），共米九千零九斤，说是为了减轻全村和贫农的负担，实际是为的干部自己少出。由于领导上的官僚主义，不深入雇贫，以前不知此事。
    生产中，县上强调解决雇贫生产资金，村干部就组织木匠铺，号召死财变活物，入股没钱就入树，强迫全村与威胁中农贱价入树。如张保全家八棵树，只作价二万五千元（仅顶一棵树价多一点）。全村大部树都号了，中农暗地哭泣，对被扶助的雇贫不满。共锯了二百一十四棵（三十五户的树），其中富农五户，上中农九户，中农十四户，贫农七户。因此引起各阶层的恐惶，都锯开了，造成中贫农相互间的矛盾与混乱，给地主留了可钻的空子。最严重的问题是武委会主任梁长会的小组，梁长会过去与地主分家不清，现在想此拉拢雇贫，掩护自己，就叫十六岁赤贫小孩张来贵当了雇贫组长，拿着升子乱到中农家借粮吃饭。又在一个闾强迫“自愿”借款十八万元，来扶助雇贫，谁也不敢反映。这实际是污辱雇贫，叫雇贫顶骂名，造成雇贫孤立。
    郭家庄政治主任李恒昌，平时在村贪污腐化，群众对他意见很多，但不敢说。这次他领导少数人斗争地主，逼死两个。
    经过讨论，认为这些村违犯了上级指示，又违犯了土地法，更违犯了群众要求——领导生产。仅少数人在脱离群众的乱斗，造成农民内部的矛盾和混乱，害了雇贫。绝不能继续下去。因此决定将梁生会、秦玉成、傅起元、李恒昌等由政府扣起，待将来平分究办（郝大成去前方还未回）。这些处分，并在全县各区、村干部会上公布了，受处分的区干部当场留下。村干部在区干部会上处理后送县。
    扩干会上，并严禁今后再有此类犯法行为，否则一定要严惩。并明确了现在集中火力进行冬季生产和土地法大纲宣传，具体规定了：
    一、停止划阶级，如生产上要解决雇贫困难，可叫全村群众讨论，谁真有困难就可解决。因这时划阶级一方划不对，一方划不清，拖时间长了，影响群众生产，等平分开始后再划。
    二、集中中农资金与变相斗争了中农的，坚决退还，退的办法是：没借给雇贫的退回去，如雇贫正用这些钱生产时，可首先由村财政和斗争果实里退还，雇贫到期还斗争果实和村财政，不要一错再错。
    三、如有违犯土地法大纲的地主和坏分子转卖财产的，坚决送政府扣押，待平分时处理。可将事实在群众中普遍讨论、教育，并由农会没收他变卖的财产，保存登记，等平分时处理。
