　　Nanzhuang Village, Fifth District of Wu'an
  　Middle Peasants Unravel Ideological Knots
  　Focus on Production Without Listening to Rumors

　　Wang Kao, of Sinanzhuang Village, in our district, was born a poor worker making earthenware basins. Since the July 7th Incident, he has developed into a middle peasant through his labor. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, his wife went to Jinggou Village to visit relatives, where she met Hao Xishu, the wife of Bai Wu, a local landlord, who said to her: "The newspaper says that land will be equally divided, and landlords will also get a share. In the past, the landlords were struggled against, and now the poor fellows have been filled up. Now, the middle peasants will be struggled against to fill up us landlords. When the land is divided equally, the poor fellows won't have the knowledge to do it, so they will still have to call on us landlords to do it, to be cadres, and participate in the equal division." After Wang Kao's wife heard what the landlord's wife said, she stopped spinning the four jin of cotton she had planned to spin before the new year to weave cloth for spring. She also ground a half dou of wheat and bought several jin of noodles to eat.

　　When someone from this village was buried in Zhongzhai, a theatrical performance was put on. Wang Maizhuang, a public security member from Changzhai Village, sold peanut candy in his village. Wang Maizhuang knew Wang Kao, so he went to his house to visit him. Wang Kao's wife cooked for him (noodles in soup). He was usually very frugal, so Wang Maizhuang asked him why he bought noodles. He replied: "It's not, just eat some, I don't know if we can make it through." Wang Maizhuang saw that his speech was knotty, so he asked him why he said that. At first, he didn't dare to say, but after talking about other things, he finally told him about hearing the landlord say that land would be divided equally, middle peasants would be struggled against to give to the landlords, and that he was not spinning cotton, grinding flour, buying noodles, was afraid, and had no heart to produce, etc. Wang Maizhuang then explained that the equal division talked about in the newspaper was to meet the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and that even though landlords would get a share, it would not be better than the poor and hired peasants, and that lower-middle peasants would get the fruits of the land, middle peasants would not be dug into, and rich middle peasants would voluntarily give up some land through consultation, otherwise concessions would be made, and that houses and floating wealth would not be touched. He also explained that class division was for the purpose of distinguishing between themselves and the landlords and rich peasants, so how could they be allowed to be cadres? He told him to focus on production and not listen to rumors, or he would suffer. After talking like this, he said that he understood and was not afraid anymore. When the cadres of Nanzhuang Village found out, they seized the winter study education to untie these ideological knots.

　　The public security member from Changzhai also wrote a letter to the cadres of Jinggou Village to explain this matter. Jinggou Village immediately called a mass meeting to have the wife of the landlord Bai Wu explain the matter. At first, she didn't say, but after being urged by the masses, she finally said the matter. She also said that she had told an anti-Japanese soldier's family (who had earned some money this year by burning pots outside and bought grain) in Jinggou Village: "You should eat and drink for a few days, or it will be divided equally." The anti-Japanese soldier's family knew she was spreading rumors and didn't listen to her. She also said this. The masses asked her who she heard it from, and she said that her husband, Bai Wu, told her. Bai Wu was called in, and he also admitted it. When asked who he heard it from, Bai Wu said he heard it from people on the road. The village chief also used this opportunity to educate the middle peasants at the meeting, telling them not to be afraid, to focus on production, and not to listen to the landlords' rumors.

　　武安五区南庄村
  　中农解开思想圪＠
  　不听谣言安心生产人民日报编辑同志：
    本区下到寺南庄村王考的，出身是个贫苦烧瓦盆工人，七七事变后靠劳动到现在发展成中农。土地法大纲公布后，他妻上井沟娘嫁探亲，遇邻家大地主白五的妻叫郝喜书，对她说：“报上登土地要平分，地主也同样一份，过去斗了地主填了穷小子们，现在要斗中农填我地主。平分时穷小子们没知识干不了，还得叫我地主干，当干部，参加平分。”王考的之妻听了地主妻这活，回到家后，家有四斤花想在年前纺了春暖织成布，听到这话把纺车放到驴圈不纺了。并磨斗半麦籽，还买几斤挂面吃。
    此村中寨埋人演剧，常寨村公安员名叫王买庄，上他村卖花生糖，王买庄与王考的认识，到此村去他家看望，玉考的妻与他做饭（下挂面汤吃），他本来很省俭，王买庄便问你买挂面瞧谁哩。他答：不是，吃点吧，不知能不能过哩哟。王买庄他看说话有圪＠，便问他为啥这样说，起初问他不敢说，后从其它扯起话，他才将听地主说平分地，斗争中农给地主，和它不纺花、磨面买挂面吃、害怕、没心生产等等谈了一遍。王买庄便将报上所谈的平分是满足贫雇要求，与地主虽有一份，不能比贫雇强，和那下中农得果实，中农不挖去，富裕中农协商方式自愿出点地，否则让步，说明房子浮财不动。并划阶级，为了和地富分清家，那还能叫他当干部呢。你好好安心生产，不要听它造谣，不然吃亏。这样的谈了一遍，他才说这样那我就通了，不害怕了。南庄村干部知道，就抓紧冬学教育，解这思想圪＠。
    常寨公安员又写信给井沟村干部说明这事情，井沟村马上召集群众叫地主白五的妻到会场说这件事，她最初不说，后经群众催促，她才将这事情说了。另将她在井沟村与一个翻身户抗属家庭（今年在外烧盆赚了些款买成粮）说：你快吃喝两天吧，不然也要平分，这抗属知道她是造谣，没听她。这事她也说了出来。群众问他是听谁说的，说是她男人白五的给她说。叫她男人白五的，他也承认了。问他听谁说，白五的说是他在路上听人家说。村长同时在会场将此事教育了中农，不要害怕，好好生产，莫听地主的造谣。
