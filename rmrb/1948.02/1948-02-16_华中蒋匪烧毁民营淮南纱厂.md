Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th—The 民营淮南 Cotton Mill in Central China, which had been forced to close down by the Kuomintang bandit "seizure" and was restored with the assistance of the democratic government, was once again completely burned down by the Kuomintang bandits in their desperate "sweep" of Dongtai and other places in the middle of last month. The factory was located in Xinfeng Town, Taipei (newly established county east of Taipei), with sixteen spinning machines, seventy-five horsepower, one thousand one hundred and sixty spindles, and more than one hundred and thirty workers, producing thirty-two pieces of cloth per day. During the Kuomintang bandit "sweep" to the town, the factory buildings and machines were all burned down, the materials were looted, and most of the workers were taken away. The 淮南 Cotton Mill was established by national capitalist Cai Maolin in May 1945. In September of the same year, our army liberated the town, and the democratic government implemented a policy of protecting industry and commerce, lending 1 million Central China currency to support it. After the ban on the import of American goods, the factory became even more prosperous, and its products sold well in the liberated areas of northern Jiangsu, central Jiangsu, and Shandong. After the Kuomintang bandits occupied Xinfeng Town in December of the year before last, bandit leader and pacification commander Li Mo'an forcibly "seized" it in the name of the Ministry of National Defense, a total of three times, until all the funds were looted and the factory shut down. Last April, the town was liberated again, and the factory, which had been shut down for four months, quickly resumed production with the assistance of the democratic government. This time, it was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits.

    华中蒋匪烧毁民营淮南纱厂
    【新华社华东十四日电】曾为蒋匪“劫收”歇业而为民主政府扶助复工的华中民营淮南纱厂，在上月中旬东台等地蒋匪垂死“扫荡”中，再次为其全部烧毁。该厂设于台北（新设县东台北部）新丰镇，计有十六架纺纱机，七十五匹马力，一千一百六十个纱锭，一百三十余工人，日出布三十二匹。此次蒋匪“扫荡”至该镇时，将该厂房屋机器全部烧毁，物资悉数抢光，工人大部捉去。按淮南纱厂为民族资本家蔡茂林等于三十四年五月所筹办，是年九月我军解放该镇，民主政府执行保护工商业政策，曾贷华中币一百万元予以扶植。禁止美货输入后，该厂更形发达，出品畅销于苏北、苏中、山东各解放区。前年十二月蒋匪侵占新丰镇后，匪首绥靖司令李默庵即以国防部名义强行“劫收”，先后共三次，直至全部资金被劫光停业。去年四月该镇再次为我解放，已停工四个月的该厂在民主政府协助下，迅速复工，此次竟为蒋匪摧毁。
