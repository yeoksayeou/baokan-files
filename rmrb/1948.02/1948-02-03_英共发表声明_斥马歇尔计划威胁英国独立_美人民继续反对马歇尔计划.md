Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - TASS, London, 29th of last month: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party recently issued a statement strongly condemning the Marshall Plan, believing that the plan's purpose is to subordinate the political and economic control of Western Europe to the United States and to establish a bloc centered on West Germany to oppose the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. The United States expects to receive economic, political, and strategic intervention rights as compensation for its "aid." The statement declared: "The plans of American big business particularly threaten the vital interests of Britain," and denounced the Marshall Plan as a threat to British political, economic, and military independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - Washington dispatch: The American people continue to oppose the Marshall Plan. Labor Party Secretary Souze stated at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 27th of last month: "The Marshall Plan effectively deprives the people and governments of sixteen European countries of the freedom to choose for themselves," and "its purpose is to implement imperialist policies" and "lead to the enslavement of Europe." On the 28th, American black progressive Congressman Shadofsky called on the House of Representatives to demand "national opposition to the Marshall Plan." New York's "World Affairs Report" also condemned the Marshall Plan, saying: "This plan is a policy that seeks to turn European countries into colonies of the United States for the production of food and raw materials for the benefit of American monopoly capitalism." Renowned journalist Steele emphasized that Marshall no longer refers to his plan as the "European Economic Recovery Plan," but only as a means to "defend the security of the United States." Steele also pointed out that the Marshall Plan aims to lower the industrial level of European countries, control these countries' imports, and thus influence their foreign policies. As a result, it will inevitably lower the living standards of the European people and turn Europe into a colony of the United States. Steele vehemently criticized the Marshall Plan, saying: "The American foreign policy under the guidance of Wall Street aims to establish American economic, military, and political control over Europe."

    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社伦敦上月二十九日讯：英共执委员顷发表声明，猛力谴责马歇尔计划，认为该计划之目的，就在于把西欧的政治经济控制权隶属于美国，并以德国西部为中心，以建立反苏反新民主国家的集团。美国期望获取其“援助”的报酬，就是经济、政治及战略的干涉权。声明宣称：“美国大商业的计划，特别威胁着英国的切身利益，并指斥马歇尔计划乃是对英国政治、经济和军事独立的威胁”。
    【新华社陕北一日电】华盛顿讯：美国人民继续反对马歇尔计划。劳工党书记苏泽上月二十七日于参院外交委员会上称：“马歇尔计划实际上剥夺了欧洲十六国人民及其政府自行选择的余地”，“其目的在于实行帝国主义政策”，“导向对欧洲的奴役”。二十八日，美国黑人进步议员沙多夫斯基在众院呼吁，要求“全国反对马歇尔计划”。纽约“世界大事报导”也痛斥马歇尔计划称：“这一计划是为了美国垄断资本主义的利益，而力图将欧洲国家变为美国生产粮食和原料的殖民地的一种政策”。名记者史蒂尔强调指出：马歇尔已不再把他的计划说成“欧洲经济复兴计划”，而只说成为了“防御美国之安全”。史氏并指出：马歇尔计划在于降低欧洲各国的工业水平，控制这些国家的入口，从而左右他们的外交政策，其结果，势必降低欧洲人民的生活水平，使欧洲沦为美国的殖民地。史氏猛烈抨击马歇尔计划称：“华尔街指导下之美国外交政策，其目的在于建立美国欧洲之经济军事政治的控制”。
