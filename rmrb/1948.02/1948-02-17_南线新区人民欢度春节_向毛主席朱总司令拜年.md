Xinhua News Agency, Front Line, Yu-Shaan-E, 15th: The people in the new district are celebrating their first Spring Festival after liberation. In a certain town in Ye County, under the leadership of the democratic government, the peasants have initially turned themselves around. On the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month, the local farmers' association distributed 33 shi of grain, as well as clothes, cloth, furniture, and other items, to 1,280 impoverished farmers. Many farmers said while receiving the grain: "At this time last year, we were hiding from debts everywhere, and we didn't even dare to go home on New Year's Eve. This year is completely different." All the families in the town posted self-written couplets, such as "The Liberation Army has come to Henan, and the common people have food to eat and clothes to wear." On the first day of the Spring Festival, gongs and drums resounded everywhere. The troops' yangko teams and the farmers' lion dance teams rejoiced together all day long. Huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were hung at the crossroads, and people crowded there all day to pay New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

The peasants of Baofeng are also celebrating the New Year amidst an intense struggle for emancipation. Everyone is wearing new clothes and exchanging New Year's greetings. The chairman of a farmers' association in a certain town told reporters, "The greatest joy this year is that no one is pressing for debts in the twelfth lunar month, no baozhang is coming to ask for New Year's donations, and we don't have to grind flour, steam steamed buns, or sweep the floor for the landlords." In two months, the village had distributed nearly 2,000 mu of land, more than 15,000 jin of grain, and more than 1,000 pieces of clothing to more than 1,000 poor people. During the New Year, the farmers' association also distributed money for a catty of meat to each poor household, so every household made dumplings on New Year's Eve.

    南线新区人民欢度春节
    向毛主席朱总司令拜年
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十五日电】新区人民欢度解放后第一个春节。叶县某镇农民在民主政府领导下已初步翻身，腊月二十八日，该地农会又分给一千二百八十个贫苦农民以三十三石粮食和衣服、布匹、家具等一部。许多农民在领粮时都说：去年这时到处躲债，年三十夜还不敢回家，今年可是大不同了。镇上各家都贴出自编的对联，如“解放军来到河南，老百姓有吃有穿”。春节第一天，到处锣鼓喧天，驻军的秧歌队和农民的狮子队尽日同乐，十字街口悬挂着毛主席和朱总司令的巨幅画像，整天挤满了人向毛主席和朱总司令拜年。
    宝丰农民也在紧张的翻身斗争中欢度新春，大家穿着新衣服拜年。某镇农会主席告诉记者说：“今年最大的痛快是腊月没人逼帐，没保长来要过年捐，不用去给地主磨面、蒸馒头、扫地了”。该村在两个月内已有一千多穷人分了将近两千多亩土地、一万五千斤粮食和一千多件衣服，过年时农会还给穷户每户分了一斤肉钱，因此年三十晚家家户户都包了饺子。
