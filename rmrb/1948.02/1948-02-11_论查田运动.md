    This document was designated for reprinting by Comrade Liu Shaoqi last November and distributed to cadres at all levels involved in land reform for reading. Comrade Shaoqi said: These are three works by Comrade Mao Zedong on the land investigation movement in the Jiangxi Soviet area in 1933. Although the situation in the Jiangxi Soviet area at that time was different from the situation in the liberated areas today, and the Party's policies and slogans were also different from those of today, and the specific methods for solving problems may not be applicable to all liberated areas today; however, many of the problems raised by Chairman Mao at that time and the principles he pointed out for solving these problems are still the same and applicable today.

    （毛泽东著）
    本文件是刘少奇同志在去年十一月指定翻印，发给土地改革中各级干部阅读的。少奇同志说：这是毛泽东同志一九三三年在江西苏区关于查田运动的三篇著作。虽然当时江西苏区的情况与今天解放区的情况并不相同，党的政策和口号也与今天并不一样，解决问题的具体办法也并不能在今天各解放区都能适用；但毛主席在当时所提出的各种问题及其所指出的解决这些问题的原则，直到今天仍有许多是相同的和适用的。
