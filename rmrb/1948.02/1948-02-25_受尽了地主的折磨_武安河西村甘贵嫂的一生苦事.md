My name is Zhang Xianzi, and I am forty-four years old this year. My man is called Zhang Gan Gui, and the neighbors all call me Gan Gui's Wife. We are poor, and in the past, the village cadres looked down on us. If I offered an opinion or said something, some cadres would say I was making trouble and being disruptive, so I didn't dare say anything. Speaking of dividing the fruits [of land reform], I got forty or fifty shares (in three rounds). To be fair, the land allocated to me was not little (ten mu or so), and half a donkey, but the tools allocated were mostly broken. My family's foundation is empty, and now I still live in my own small, dilapidated house. There's still nothing in my home.

I have been liberated and finally have some good times. My man lived as a long-term hired laborer his whole life. He said he wanted to come back and enjoy his own life, but alas! Who knew he would die of illness the year he came back. I feel sad. My man suffered for over fifty years without enjoying any good times. Speaking of my suffering, there is also a lot to tell.

My maiden name is Li, and I am from a village in eastern Wu'an. When I was little, my family had ten mu or so of land and seven or eight people. If my dad worked hard, the family could barely make a living. But my dad was not upright, indulging in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. He first sold the land and then the house, selling off all the family's possessions. When I was ten years old, my mother died of anger, my dad drove out my brother, and sold me to a wealthy man named Xu Shan, who had over three qing of land, to be a maid. He sold me for forty silver dollars. After I went to the wealthy man's house, there was so much suffering! The wealthy man's daughter ate special meals, while I ate radish strips and dried bean pods. The wealthy man's daughter wore silk and fancy cloth clothes, while I wore the wealthy man's daughter's discarded rags. The wealthy man's daughter sat on the kang and ordered me around: "Bring the chopsticks, make some food." I stood on the ground serving people. Every day I had to get up early without washing my face or combing my hair to sweep the floor, wipe the table, empty the chamber pot, make the bed… If my dad and brother came to see me, the wealthy man's wife would say: "If they come, I have to give them travel money. They come every few days. How much money do I have to give?" After saying this, she would make a fuss (give me a hard time). Her face was not a face, and her nose was not a nose. I felt sad and cried several times. Later I told my brother: "Every time you come, the wealthy man gives me a hard time. I can't stand it here. In the future, I will live and die in this house. Just consider that you don't have me as a sister!" From then on, my brother never came again. I missed home and wanted to go back and see. The wealthy man said he had bought me and wouldn't let me go back. Alas, I have a hard life (tears welling up in her eyes). I can't see my relatives, and I can't go back home!

When I was little, I wore broken shoes and socks. When it was cold, my feet were cold, but the wealthy man didn't care about me. If I knew how to make them, I wore them. If I didn't know how, I didn't wear them. When I grew to fifteen or sixteen and knew how to do needlework, I didn't make anything for myself. The wealthy man piled all the work of clothes and socks for his whole family on me. Sometimes, I felt sad and said: "If my dad hadn't sold me, why would I be serving people?" When the wealthy man heard it, he would scold: "You stupid bean! Your dad sold you, and I spent money for the purpose of you serving me." If I felt unwell, I would cry for a while. The wealthy man would say: "It's a perfectly good time, why are you crying? You're just a spoilsport."

I was in the wealthy man's house for twelve years, and the wealthy man was mean to me for twelve years. When the wealthy man's daughter got married, she wore silk and satin, all red and flowery. When I got married, I thought I had suffered for him for twelve years, and he should give me something, even if it was just a little. I asked for two new clothes, but the wealthy man lied and didn't give them to me. I was so sad that I cried. The wealthy man said: "What are you crying about? Huh, you want those clothes, but do you have the figure to wear them?" Alas, the wealthy man is so cruel! Why couldn't I bear his treatment? He ordered me around, and I served him. He had money, and I was poor. I thought about it, and it was all because of the wives, nephews, and wealthy men who exploited us.

My man was also a long-term hired laborer in his family. Usually, he didn't treat me as his family member. When we got married, he still used me to exploit my man, demanding 160 silver dollars from my man. My man gave him 140 silver dollars, which was not enough. The wealthy man demanded that my man work as a long-term laborer for a year to make up for it.

Speaking of my in-laws' family, the times were not good either. My man started herding cattle for the wealthy man when he was twelve or thirteen years old, and at fourteen he started working as a young long-term laborer for the wealthy man. Afterwards he was always a long-term laborer. Before the family divided, we mostly ate bran flour and vegetables. After the family divided, we got a mu or so of land. My man worked as a long-term laborer outside, and I spun thread and did odd jobs for the wealthy man at home, and I couldn't even take care of the family. Later, our family went to Xu Shan, to the house of the wealthy man where I had been a maid, to rent land to farm. We lived in his house, and the grain we harvested was divided four-six. Carrying coal to sell was also divided four-six. My grain had to be stored in his house as well. The wealthy man put my grain in his house, and my family didn't have enough to eat. The wealthy man said I didn't know how to manage my affairs, that I was extravagant. One year, I harvested cotton. During the New Year, I wanted to sell some cotton to buy some oil and salt to eat. The wealthy man said I used too much oil and salt. Alas, other wealthy men poured large jars of oil into their homes and it was nothing, but we two saw no end to the wealthy man's exploitation. This bottomless pit was hard to fill, so we decided not to farm his land anymore. When settling accounts, the wealthy man took all the grain and still said it wasn't enough. The wealthy man said my family owed him more than 300 yuan for bedding money. In reality, I only owed him about 110 yuan, but who knew that the wealthy man's interest would snowball, and in three years it would grow to more than 300 yuan.

When I returned to Hexi, I still suffered. My man was still working as a long-term laborer outside, and after I finished the work in my own fields at home, I worked short-term jobs for the wealthy men, harvesting millet, picking corn, and picking cotton. I left before dawn and only returned in the pitch black. At home, I was a woman, but in the fields, I was a long-term laborer. I suffered a lot of anger from the wealthy men doing this work. I was harvesting millet at the house of Old Wanzi (one of the biggest landlords in Hexi), and my child came to find me. The wealthy man said: "Hey, tell her child to leave. Her child will eat my family's food." I was picking cotton at the house of Da Bao Cheng (a wealthy man), and after picking six or seven jin, he used a large scale to deduct the weight, and it became four or five jin. After picking the cotton, the women had to carry it back, which was so heavy that we were sore all over. We would walk for a while and then rest for a while. The neighbors saw it and said why the women were carrying it. The wealthy man said: "If she doesn't carry it, what is she doing?" I picked up some cotton bolls in the field, and the wealthy man poured them into his field for his sheep to eat. My child picked up firewood, and before he even reached the edge of the wealthy man's garden, the wealthy man said: "Don't come here, you'll ruin my garden." One day, I was returning from picking wheat in the stone cave with my child. My child was thirsty and wanted to drink water. I told my child to go to the embankment under Lao Ruizi's house to drink a mouthful of water. Before my child could drink, the wealthy man scolded: "Who told you to come here to drink water? Is this water for you to drink?" He slapped my child to the ground under the embankment, and a red lump appeared on his head. When we poor people go to the wealthy man's fields to pick up some wheat, the wealthy man uses a sickle to chop it. One time, I picked up a pile of wheat in someone else's field all morning and came to Er Bao Cheng's field. He took away all the wheat I had picked up, saying that it was picked up in his field. I picked up a piece of corn, and when I walked to the edge of the wealthy man's field, the wealthy man put my basket in his cloth bag. As soon as I walked to the edge of the wealthy man's field, the wealthy man told me to leave quickly, fearing that I would take his things. Another time, I picked up a small radish in a wealthy man's field. The wealthy man didn't let me pick it up, saying that if he gave it to his sheep to eat, he could still eat meat, but if I ate it, it would be of no use.

During the famine years (1932), we ate sesame cakes and tree-top vegetables (elm leaves, willow leaves). I got up early in the morning while the wealthy man was still lying on the kang. I quietly went to the wealthy man's house to get some elm leaves to eat. When the wealthy man found out, he didn't let me climb the tree, saying that I would break his branches. He then trimmed the tree bare, telling me that I couldn't climb it in the future. The wealthy man wouldn't even let me eat tree leaves! My family had nothing to eat. My plump child was so hungry that he was nothing. I sent one of my sons to a trafficker in Zhao Village and sold him for sixty yuan. When the people came to take my child, I bought two sesame cakes to coax my child to leave. My poor child didn't want to leave. I thought: if he doesn't leave, both children will starve to death. If one leaves, both can live. I steeled my heart, gritted my teeth, and hit my child twice. Only then did my child leave crying. I always think about my child. When I lie down at night, I imagine my child is here, but then I look and he's not there. Thinking about it made me fall seriously ill. Now, I don't even know where my child is (she cried)?

During the famine years, I still had to beg for food for two years. I went to the wealthy man's house in the village. The wealthy man slammed the door shut, not even giving me a mouthful of water. I didn't dare beg in my own village anymore. I led my children to Stone Cave, Hedong, Qingyan Temple, Shili Dian, and Yetao, begging for a little to eat, and if I couldn't get any, I would come back and nibble on some sesame cakes and drink some water. Alas, talking about this makes me feel sad. I have suffered enough.

　　受尽了地主的折磨
  　武安河西村甘贵嫂的一生苦事
    俺名是张闲子，今年四十四岁，俺男人叫张甘贵，邻家都叫俺甘贵嫂。俺人穷，过去村上干部瞧不上咱，俺要是提个意见说个话，有些干部就说是捣乱破坏，俺不敢说啥。说分果实吧，俺有四五十分（三回），俺讲良心，分给俺的地可不算少（十来亩）还有半个驴，但分的家伙都是破烂的多。俺家底儿空，现在俺还住着自己的一间小破屋，俺家里还是没任啥。
    俺翻身了，刚有了时光，俺男人在外住了一辈子长工，说回来过过自己的时光，唉！那知回来后年时病死了。俺心里难受，俺男人苦了五十多年，没享到一点时光，谈起俺的苦，也有一大堆。
    俺娘家姓李，武安东乡人。小时，俺娘家有个十来亩地，七、八口人，俺爹要是勤受，家里生活也能糊过，但俺爹不正派，吃喝嫖赌又不受，先卖地后卖房，把个家当卖的光大光。俺十岁上俺娘气死了，俺爹撵出俺哥，把俺就卖给徐山一个三顷多地的财主家做使女，把俺卖了四十块现洋。俺去到财主家，苦处可就多啦！财主闺女吃的小灶饭，俺吃的是萝卜条子干豆荚；财主闺女穿的绸的花布好衣裳，俺穿的是财主闺女不要了的破烂衫；财主闺女坐在炕上使唤咱：“筷子拿来，做点饭”，俺是站在地上侍候人；天天早起脸不洗，头不梳就扫地、抹桌子、端尿盆、铺床叠被、端碗拿筷………。要是俺爹和俺哥来看咱，财主老婆就说：“来了要给盘缠，不隔几天就来，有多少钱给呢”？说完了还要出故事（给不好脸看）。脸不是脸，鼻子不是鼻子，俺心里难受，哭了几大场。后来俺跟俺哥说：“你来一回，财主就跟俺出一回故事，俺看不住这，以后俺活在人家活，死也在人家死，家里就顶没俺这个人吧！”从此俺哥就再也没来了。俺想家，想回去看看，财主又说俺卖给他了不叫回。唉，俺命苦呀（眼泪流在眼边），亲人来看不叫看，俺想回去不叫回！
    俺小，脚上穿的破鞋袜，天冷了，俺脚冷，财主也不管咱，俺会做就穿，不会做就不穿。俺长到十五六岁会做营生（针线活），俺给自己做的没任啥，财主就把他一家子的衣服袜子活堆到俺身上。有时，俺心眼难受，俺说：“不是俺爹卖了咱，俺为啥侍候人。”财主听见了就骂：“死豆子，你爹卖了你，俺花了钱，为的就是侍候俺。”俺要不舒服了，哭一阵，财主就说：“格正正的时光，哭啥，就你败兴。”
    俺在财主家十二年，财主就刻薄了咱十二年。财主闺女娶时，绸的缎的红花花，俺娶时，心想俺给他受了十二年，好赖该给点，俺要两件新衣裳，财主谎着不给，俺难过的哭起来，财主说：“哭啥，哼，你要那个衣裳，有没有那个衣裳架？”唉，财主刻薄人这样狠！为啥俺受他不动，人家使唤咱，俺侍候他，人家有钱俺穷苦，俺想了想，还不都是妻侄财主剥削的咱。
    俺男人也是他家一个长工。平时不把俺当着他家人看，娶时还用俺来剥削俺的男人，要俺男人给他一百六十块现洋，俺男人给了一百四十块现洋，不够数，财主就要俺男人抵了一年长工。
    说起俺婆家，时光也不好，俺男人十二、三岁就给财主家放牛，十四岁给财主家当小长工，以后就一直住长工。没分家时，俺吃糠面和菜的时候多。分了家，分了亩把地，俺男人在外住长工，俺在家给财主纺线做活还顾不住家。后来俺一家就到徐山俺做使女的那家财主租地种，俺住在他家，打的粮食四六分，驮煤卖煤也四六分，俺的粮食也要放在他家。财主把俺粮食往他家里放，俺家不够吃，财主反说俺不会过时光，俺手大。一年俺收了花，过年了，俺想卖点花买些油盐吃，财主就说俺油盐吃的费了。唉，人家财主大罐子油往家打就没啥，俺俩看财主的剥削没个完，这个底子难填满，就决心不种他家地了。算帐时，财主把粮食全收了还说不够他，财主说俺家欠了他的铺垫钱三百多，实际俺欠的只有百十块，那知财主利滚利，三年就涨到三百多。
    俺回河西还是受，俺男人还在外打长工，俺在家把自己地里活经由完了，给财主打短工，割谷子、撇玉茭、摘棉花，天不明就走，黑洞洞才回。在家我是个娘们，在地里就是个长工。俺做这活也受了好多财主的气。俺给老万子家（河西大地主之一）割谷，俺孩来找，财主说：“嘿，叫她孩子走吧，叫她孩子吃了俺家饭了。”俺给大宝成家（财主）摘花，摘了六七斤，他用大秤一扣，成了四五斤。摘了花还要俺妇女背回来，把俺压得酸溜溜，走一会歇一会，邻家看见了说为啥叫妇女背，财主说：“她不背做啥。”俺在地里拾些花桃子，财主给倒到他地里给他羊吃。俺孩拾柴火，没走到财主的园边，财主就说：“不要来，给俺园子糟了。”一天俺带着孩子从石洞拾麦子回来，俺孩干渴要喝水，俺叫孩子去老瑞子家堰底下喝口水，俺孩还没喝，财主就骂：“谁叫你来喝水，俺这水叫你喝的呢。”一耳光把俺孩子摔到堰底下，头上碰了个红疙瘩。俺穷人去财主地里拾点麦子，财主就用链砍。一回，俺一上午在别家地里拾了一圪堆麦子来到二宝成地里，人家把俺拾的全收走了，说拾的是他家地里的。俺拾个玉茭，走到财主地边，财主就把俺篮子装在他的布袋里了。俺一走到财主地边，财主就叫快走，怕拿了他的东西。又一回，俺在一家财主地里拾个小萝卜，财主不叫拾说给他羊吃了还能吃肉，给俺吃了没啥用。
    赖年景（三十二年）俺吃的麻饼，树头菜（榆叶、杨叶）。俺清早起来，财主还躺在炕上，俺悄悄上财主家榆树弄点榆叶吃，财主知道了不叫俺上树说压坏了他的树枝，随即把树刨的光溜溜，叫俺以后不能上。财主连树叶也不给俺吃！俺家没啥吃，俺骨碌碌（胖）孩子饿得不成啥样，把俺一个小子送给赵庄人贩子卖了六十块钱。人家来领俺孩，俺买了两个烧饼哄俺孩走，可怜俺孩不愿走，俺想：不走两个孩子都会饿死，走了一个，两个都能活，俺心肝一狠，咬咬牙，打了俺孩两棒棒，俺孩才哭着走了。俺一直想着俺孩，夜里躺时，俺想着俺孩在跟前，一看，又没有，想得俺生了一场恶病。如今，俺孩也不知在那儿（她哭了）？
    赖年景，俺还要过二年饭，俺去村上上街财主家，财主就把门哗啦插上了，连一口水都不给俺，俺不敢在自己村要了，引着孩子跑石洞、河东、青烟寺、十里店、冶陶，要一点吃一点，要不到回来就啃些麻饼喝口水。唉，说到这，俺心里难受，俺受的苦也够了。
