    Rectify Organization, Develop People's Economy
    Central Bureau Decides to Clean Up Organ Production
    Regional Cleanup Committee Formally Established
    [This Newspaper's News] The CCP Jinji-Luyu Central Bureau issued the "Decision on Cleaning Up Organ Production" on January 20th, the original text of which is as follows:
    In our region, all levels of Party, government, military, civilian organs, troops, groups, and schools have undertaken organ production to overcome financial difficulties and subsidize organ expenses. Over the past few years, they have completed certain tasks. However, in subsequent development, due to violating the principle of personally producing wealth, they have gradually leaned towards commerce, thus leading to drawbacks such as infringing upon the interests of the masses, engaging in speculation, disrupting finance, and undermining policies. Some even shielded targets of struggle and concealed the fruits of struggle, while a few individuals became corrupt and degenerate as a result. Now, in order to rectify the organization and develop the people's economy, the following decisions are made:
    1.  Except for personally undertaken, spare-time production, such as land reclamation, spinning, knitting sweaters, sewing, raising pigs, and flour mills and tofu workshops opened to improve the lives of organ personnel (but not allowed to use public grain or funds, nor allowed to hire labor to operate, and if there is a surplus of products, they are only allowed to sell to cooperatives, not directly to the market) and organ employee production-consumption cooperatives registered in accordance with cooperative regulations, or supply factories set up due to work needs, which are specially permitted to continue operating after approval by the border government, all other organ production must be terminated and cleaned up. All purchasing units established externally by various units must be terminated or transferred to the Trade General Company, and the purchasing tasks will be taken over by the Trade General Company.
    2.  For organ production departments supplied by border region grain funds, their public shares, assets, and dividends shall be submitted to the Border Region Finance Department as border region fiscal revenue. Those supplied by local grain funds shall be turned over to local fiscal revenue and handed over to governments above the county level. Those operated with village grain funds shall be rectified in the rectification of village finances. Those belonging to individuals or loans shall be returned to individuals or creditors after proof. If they are the fruits of mass struggle, or land occupied and rented from farmers, they shall be unconditionally returned to the local farmers' association and distributed to farmers. Land, houses, tools, etc., bought and sold from farmers shall be returned to the farmers separately. For public funds invested in private shops, factories, or cooperatives, the funds and dividends must be withdrawn and handled in accordance with the above-mentioned methods.
    3.  Organ production such as factories, workshops, and shops that are beneficial to the local area can be transferred to local cooperatives or private operation at a price. Paper cigarette factories, wineries, and larger shops that are beneficial to the local area shall be taken over by industrial and commercial departments at a price. Transportation tools, livestock, large quantities of cotton, cloth, salt, medicine, telecommunications, printing equipment, etc., can be purchased by the transportation and trade departments. Raw gold, silver cash, and securities shall be submitted to the corresponding level of finance departments and transferred level by level to the Border Region Finance Department. Assets that are inconvenient to transfer, unsalable goods, and remnants shall be sold at a marked price. Those that cannot be sold shall be transferred to the trade departments for processing at a low price.
    4.  All organ production that has been decided to be terminated shall be limited to stopping business operations and completing procedures by the end of February 1937 and completing the termination by the end of May. Its branches should be concentrated in the general store for processing. Members will be sent by the liquidation committee to assist the competent personnel of the organ production to register all the assets. Without the permission of the liquidation committee, no organ may use it, let alone drill holes, eat and drink heavily, embezzle, waste, or steal property, and those who violate it will be treated as corruption. All organ production cadres will be introduced to the organization departments of the same level Party committees or military region political departments by the liquidation committee at any time to be assigned other jobs, but their main responsible persons shall not be transferred during the liquidation period to assist in the work. Hired and miscellaneous personnel shall be handled by the liquidation committee in conjunction with the original competent authority. In order to implement the liquidation of organ production and the finances of various organs, the organ surplus of 36 years must be turned over to the public. If the organ production assets have been used to make up for losses and have been reviewed and approved by the liquidation committee, they will be allowed to be written off, and those that are not allowed must be recovered. In order to solve certain losses of various levels of organs and units and certain difficulties that may occur due to the cancellation of organ production, 20% shall be retained from the received assets, which shall be uniformly controlled and resolved by the Border Region Finance Department, the General Military Region Supply Department, and the administrative office and military region. During the liquidation period, the liquidation committee, in conjunction with the industrial, commercial, trade, financial departments, cooperatives, exchanges, etc., shall be responsible for adjusting prices to prevent soaring and plummeting. In order to promote thrift, encourage savings, and prevent the malpractices of individual production, the assets withdrawn by individuals can be saved in the Jinnan Bank or invested in shops established by the industrial and commercial trade departments.
    5.  In order to thoroughly clean up organ production, it is decided that the heads of all levels and units are responsible for the cleaning up work. The Central Bureau organizes a regional cleaning committee to be responsible for leading, inspecting, receiving and other matters. The organ production of the troops system is led and organized by the Political Department of the Great Military Region, and is responsible to the regional cleaning committee. The cleaning committees of all levels of local Party, government, civilian and school organizations are selected and appointed by the Party committees at the same level, are led by the Party committees at the same level, and are responsible to the cleaning committees at the higher level. The heads of all levels and units are responsible not only to the cleaning committee at the same level, but also to their directly subordinate leading organs. The functions and powers of the cleaning committees at all levels are mainly to clean up, inspect, receive, keep, auction, and transfer all assets and supervise the submission of the same level of financial departments, and those who cannot submit immediately must report at any time, and should frequently report the cleaning situation and summarize experience.
    [This Newspaper's News] In order to thoroughly clean up the production of various organs and troops in the region, the Central Bureau decided on January 30th to form a regional cleaning committee composed of seven comrades, including Rong Wusheng, Zhou Wenlong, Wang Shiying, Zhang Nansheng, Ping Jiesan, Zhou Yucheng, and Lin Haiyun. Under the leadership of the Central Bureau, it is responsible for the leadership, inspection, receiving and other matters of the regional cleaning work, and decided that Comrades Rong Wusheng and Zhou Wenlong should be appointed as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee respectively. The cleaning committees of each district and each directly affiliated organ, in addition to being led by the Party committees at the same level, must be responsible to the committee.

    整顿组织发展人民经济
    中央局决定清理机关生产
    全区清理委员会正式成立
    【本报消息】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局于一月二十日发出“关于清理机关生产的决定”，原文如下：
    我区各级党政军民机关、部队、团体、学校，为克服财政困难，补助机关经费，进行的机关生产，几年来，完成了一定任务。但在以后发展中，由于违反了亲自动手生产财富原则，逐渐偏向商业，因而发生侵犯群众利益，投机取巧，捣乱金融，破坏政策等弊端，甚有包庇斗争对象，隐蔽斗争果实，而少数人员亦因此贪污腐化。兹为整顿组织，发展人民经济，特作如下决定：
    一、除亲自动手，业余生产，如开荒、纺织、打毛衣、缝纫、养猪、以及为改善机关人员生活所开设之粉房、豆腐坊（但不准动用公粮、公款，不准雇工经营，其产物如有剩余只准卖给合作社，不准直接向市场推销）和按照合作社条例登记之机关职工生产消费合作社，或因工作需要，所设之供给工厂，经边府批准，特许其继续经营外，其他一切机关生产，一律结束清理。各单位对外设立之采购单位，一律结束或移交贸易总公司，采购任务，统交贸易总公司接办。
    二、凡由边区粮款供给的部门的机关生产，其公股资财及红利悉解边府财政厅，作边区财政收入。由地方粮款供给者，归地方财政收入，交县级以上政府。村粮款经营者，在整顿村财政中整顿之。属于个人或借贷部分，经证明后，归还个人或债权人，如系群众斗争果实，或占种租种农民之土地，应无条件交还当地农会，分给农民。典买农民之土地房屋工具等，分别退还农民。公款投入私人商店工厂或合作社者，其资金及红利均须抽回，依上列办法处理。
    三、机关生产如系工厂作坊及对地方有益的商店，可作价转让当地合作社或私人经营。纸烟工厂酒坊对地方有益之较大商店，则作价交工商部门接办。交通运输工具、牲畜、大宗棉、布、盐、医药、电讯、印刷器材等，可交交通贸易部门购买。生金银现款及有价证券，悉交同级财政部门，递级转解边府财政厅，其中不便转让之资财，冷货残物，采取标价出售办法，无法出售者，低价转让贸易部门处理。
    四、凡决定结束的一切机关生产，统限于三十七年二月底停止经营办理手续，五月底结束完毕，其所设分支店，应集中总店办理，由清理委员会派员协同机关生产之主管人员登记全部资财，非经清委会允许，任何机关不得动用，更不得钻空、大吃大喝、贪污浪费或窃取财物，违者以贪污论。所有机关生产干部，由清委会根据情况，随时介绍同级党委或军区政治部组织部门，另行分配工作，但其主要负责人员，在清理期间，不得他调，以协助工作进行。雇用及杂务人员，由清委会会同原主管机关处理之。为贯彻清理机关生产及各机关之财政，其三十六年度之机关节余，须一律交公，其因弥补亏空，已动用机关生产资财，经清委会审查批准者，准予报销，不准者必须追回。为解决各级机关单位某些亏空及因取消机关生产可能发生的某些困难，于接收资财中，截留二成，由边府财政厅、大军区供给部及行署军区统一掌握解决之。在清理期间，清委会协同工商贸易金融部门及合作社交易所等，负责调整物价，以防暴涨暴跌。为提倡节约，奖励储蓄，防止个人生产之流弊，个人抽回之资财，可由冀南银行储蓄，或投入工商贸易部门所设之商店。
    五、为彻底清理机关生产，决定清理工作，由各级及各机关单位首长负责。中央局组织全区清理委员会负责领导检查接收等事宜。部队系统之机关生产，由大军区政治部领导组织清理，并对全区清委会负责。各级地方党政民学组织各级清委会，其人员由同级党委选任，受同级党委领导，并对上级清委会负责。各级及各机关单位首长，除对同级清委会负责外，并对其直属上级领导机关负责。各级清委会之职权，主要为清理检查接收保管拍卖及转让一切资财并监督同级财政部门上解，不能即时上解者，须随时表报，并应经常报告清理情况及总结经验。
    【本报消息】为彻底清理全区各机关部队生产，中央局于一月三十日决定以戎伍胜、周文龙、王世英、张南生、平杰三、周玉成、林海云等七同志组成全区清理委员会。在中央局领导下，负责全区清理工作的领导、检查、接收等事宜，并决定戎伍胜、周文龙两同志分任该委员会正副主任委员，各区各直属机关之清委会，除受同级党委领导外，均须对该委员会负责。
