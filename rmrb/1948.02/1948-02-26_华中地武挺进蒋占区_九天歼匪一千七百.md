Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 24th: Following their victory in the anti-"mopping-up" operation last month, the local armed forces of Central China advanced into towns occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in early February, and crushed the local "mopping-up" operations of Chiang's bandits against Huaibei, annihilating 1,773 enemies, including 1,223 captured alive, and capturing more than ten strongholds. The details are as follows: From the 1st to the 4th, the local armed forces of the First Military Sub-district launched an offensive against the Jiangyin, Taixing, and Rugao areas along the Yangtze River, capturing Yantou, two miles north of Taixing City, and Xieqiao and Tuqiao, east of Jiangyin, completely annihilating over 620 enemy troops defending the area, and defeating a battalion of enemy reinforcements from Jiangyin City, eliminating more than 50 of them; taking advantage of the victory to liberate Xingang, an important town along the river, they also annihilated a battalion of the 21st Division of Chiang's bandits coming from Shizhuang (an enemy-occupied stronghold) south of Rugao, killing and capturing over 300, including Battalion Commander Huang Guiting. At the same time, the local armed forces of Zishi (a newly established county northwest of Rugao) annihilated two puppet bandit squadrons of Taixing County near Jiangnian. On the night of the 7th, the local armed forces of Dongtai launched a surprise attack on Beiguan Bridge in the suburbs of the city, eliminating over 70 enemy troops. On the night of the 1st, the local armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district captured Beifurong in western Xinghua, completely annihilating over 200 Chiang bandits, including the Third Brigade of the Xinghua Security Forces. The Chiang bandits in the area fled in panic. Six strongholds, including Nanwangzhuang and Zhao Jiazhuang, were immediately recovered by us. The local armed forces of the Sixth Military Sub-district in the Huaibei area successively advanced into Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang, Suqian, Muyang, and the south side of the Longhai Railway to eliminate local bandits, eliminating a total of 206 enemy troops. The local armed forces of the Seventh Military Sub-district in Huaibei crushed the "mopping-up" operations of four regiments of Chiang's bandits against the central areas of our Sixian, Suqian, and Siyang counties. The local armed forces who persisted in the inner lines killed over 50 enemy troops, including a battalion commander, in Longjietao, Siyang. On the 6th, the outer line local armed forces annihilated the First and Second Brigades of Chiang's bandit police, totaling over 200, at Zhangdalu. The "mopping-up" enemy troops fled in a panic towards Xuefeng Town (formerly Bancheng). On the 9th, we again annihilated over 50 enemy troops in the Qiujia area south of Suining. In total, we captured 53 light and heavy machine guns, two 82mm mortars, small cannons, 20 60mm mortars, 39 Thompson and carbine submachine guns, and over 500 long and short rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, February 24th: Around the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army carried out in-depth activities in the suburbs of Weihai City, killing or wounding a total of over 80 enemy troops in the areas of Naigu Mountain, Pucuilou, and Gumoling. During the victorious attacks on the enemy, the Disaster Relief Committee of the Weihai Municipal People's Government specially allocated a portion of grain, which was transported by the work team through the artillery fire to relieve the poor people in the suburbs of the city who were suffering under the oppression of Chiang's bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 24th: Around the Spring Festival, the counties of Penglai, Jidong (east of Jimo), and Weinan (south of Weixian) in Jiaodong launched political offensives against the isolated enemy strongholds and bandits. Party and government personnel and local armed forces in Weinan County inserted themselves into the enemy-occupied areas at night to conduct loudspeaker appeals, write letters, hold puppet family meetings, and write "admonition strips" on the doors of puppet family members. This caused the puppet township security teams to flee in droves. In the Songjia Shuangmiao and Guanqiao Chiang-occupied townships, 25 of the township teams had 12 members immediately flee. In Penglai, 41 enemy troops defected to the liberated areas in a matter of days. The Chiang bandits in each city are now extremely panicked, intensifying martial law, not allowing soldiers to go out, and not allowing residents to travel freely.
