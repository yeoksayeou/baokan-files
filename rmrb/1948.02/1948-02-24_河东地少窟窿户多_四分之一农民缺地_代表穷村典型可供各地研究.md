　　Hedong Has Little Land and Many Debt-Ridden Households;
    One-Quarter of Farmers Lack Land
  　A Typical Poor Village Representative for Study by Various Regions
    [Our News] Hedong Village is a well-known poor village in the Ninth District of Wu'an. Before the disaster year (1942), the village had about 500 people in over 120 households, with about 12 *qing* of land, averaging about 2-2.5 *mu* per person. At that time, about 80 percent of the village were landless or land-poor farmers. Their options were to work as long-term laborers or short-term workers for landlords in nearby villages, gather firewood, do carpentry, or go to Manchuria. Most farmers were in debt. Only four households in Hedong Village had more land, but even in their heyday, the four families combined had no more than 300 *mu* of land. After the Double Reduction (anti-Japanese policy to reduce rent and interest), this was weakened. After the May 4th Directive, the household with the most land among these four had no more than 50 *mu*, and the least had less than 40 *mu*. It was impossible to meet the needs of all the landless and land-poor farmers in the village with just these four households. The reasons for the scarcity of land and the poverty of the people were not only the exploitation by the rich peasants in the village, but also the exploitation of land rent and debt interest by landlords in nearby villages (Hexi, Shidong, and Tian'erzhuang), which made it impossible for the farmers in the village to rise up. Some land was also mortgaged and seized. Before the disaster year, except for the "Four Great Families," almost every household lacked food, and everyone was starving. About one-tenth of the villagers fled. Many people were lost or starved to death. Meng Yuekui, a poor peasant, had a family of six, but only he and his son were left. The Zeng family of four starved to death, losing half of their members. "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army here, Hedong would have been completely finished in that disaster year." "The Eighth Route Army transported relief grain to the people through the enemy's blockade," the masses of Hedong always remember. However, this relief grain did not completely reach the people's stomachs, and some cadres helped each other. Meng Zhaoshun, a poor peasant, stole seventeen (or two handfuls) black beans from the cooperative and was detained for three days, empty-bellied. His wife had to bring him some boiled water. As a result, he lost three *mu* of land to pay off the "fine."
    Before and after the disaster year, landlords in nearby villages evaded burdens, and land prices plummeted. After the Double Reduction, Hedong Village bought a considerable amount of land (mostly from Shidong Village). In addition, the county government allocated about 40 *mu* of public land confiscated from traitors, increasing year by year. Up to now, the land has increased from about 12 *qing* to 17 *qing* and more than 70 *mu* (the population has remained roughly the same, and the number of households has increased to 152 due to separate residences). As a result, the lives of the masses and class relations have undergone great changes. Looking at the 26 households in the Fifth *Lü*: in 1940-1942, the average land per person was only 2.06 *mu*; after the Double Reduction, in 1943, the average was 2.70 *mu* per person; after the May 4th Directive, it rose to 3.44 *mu* per person. Although the land has increased, the lives of poor and hired farmers are still very hard. Among the 26 households in the Fifth *Lü*, five households have absolutely insufficient land, accounting for a little less than 20 percent. Three households have difficulty with food, accounting for 13 percent. Fifteen households have no livestock at all or the livestock is unusable, accounting for a little less than 57.7 percent. The least land per person is 2.16 *mu*, and the most is 4.16 *mu*. (The Third *Lü* has a larger gap, with the least land being 2.08 *mu* and the most being 6.19 *mu*). In addition, houses and farm tools are generally lacking, and some landless poor have not yet been allocated housing. Meng Xianduo, an old couple, a young couple, and a child live together in one room and sleep on one *kang*. Many houses have nowhere to shelter when it rains.
    None of the main officials in the village are poor or hired peasants. The village chief, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, the director of finance and grain, the director of civil affairs, the managers and deputy managers of the cooperative, and the director of preferential treatment for revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are all old middle peasants who have been village cadres for many years. When distributing fruits and assigning burdens, the cadres mostly consider their own interests. Land is not distributed, but rather priced and sold or exchanged. The poor and hired peasants cannot afford it, and good land and nearby land mostly fall into the hands of the cadres. The remaining or exchanged sandy beach land, distant land, and fragmented land are then used to "fill the holes." The "support" for the one and a half *mu* of land given to the extremely poor Li Xiaolin is in fifteen or sixteen pieces, and he is also criticized for being lazy and unwilling to cultivate it. The order of distribution of floating property fruits is: families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, cadres, and activists. Only the remaining scraps are given to the poor and hired peasants. Wheat Security's wife spent 5,000 yuan to buy a broken jar that she couldn't use when she got it home, and the old man Niu Security was given a woman's jacket. Most of the twenty-four revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families in the village are middle peasants or new middle peasants. In addition to distributing fruits, they are given an extra three points, and they have all become wealthy households. Another part of the floating property is not distributed, but rather invested in cooperative shares or transferred to village finances, and cadres spend it on business trips. The cadres and activists have formed a small group of thirty-two people. The political director said: "With these thirty-two people, I can do any work." They cannot see the masses, and the masses dare not speak at meetings for fear of saying something wrong, and then people will shout slogans; they are afraid of being asked: "What kind of thinking do you have?" The political director's mule died. At a meeting of key cadres, they felt that the cooperative's mule should be sold to him. After the decision, they arranged for activists to have a "democratic discussion" at the farmers' association. The masses saw that the cadres' speeches were unanimous, so they dared not say anything. The cadres flaunt their achievements in front of the poor and hired peasants. Old Lengzi said to the poor and hired peasants: "I told you to offer opinions, but you don't dare to offer them, but you get to share the fruits. Do you know where these fruits come from?" When distributing the fruits, honest farmers are treated like thieves and not allowed into the circle. They say: "Get out, what if something is missing?" Last winter, as a reward for activists, thirty-two people distributed fruits at night. The masses watched from the cracks in the door as the cadres carried flour jars home. Corruption is also very common. First, the fruits are taken to the cooperative, and after a few days, they end up in their own homes. The political director said: "At the meeting in the district, I was determined not to be corrupt, but when I see things, I want them and always find a way to get them." The deputy village chief already has a house but still wants to exchange it for a better one. Ma Shan's mother's house is small and leaky, and there is no way to live in it when it rains. Last year, she spent 30,000 Jichaos to buy a house but has not moved in yet. But generally speaking, compared with nearby villages, the conflict between cadres and the masses is not acute. There are the following problems that need to be solved between farmers:
    1. Thinking of moving the middle peasants: Since "squeezing feudalism" last summer, the idea of cutting leeks has been quite common. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the middle peasants also had the fear of "disrupting and dividing equally." After a lot of publicity and explanation, there is still doubt, because there are no landlords and rich peasants to fight in this village, and there are no definite wealthy middle peasants to mobilize, and there is not much "fat" to extract from nearby villages. Some middle peasants with land above the average are afraid and are slow to send manure.
    2. Sectarian problems: Hedong Village has the so-called distinction between "inside the gate" and "outside the gate." "Inside the gate" was originally one big family, now divided into more than a dozen households, most of whom farm and do carpentry. The masses "outside the gate" believe that they have a sect, "sharp heads," and the work is not easy to do; while they believe that the "outside the gate" is squeezing them out and dare not speak at meetings.
    3. Some poor and hired peasants (about 20 percent of the village population) have not yet turned themselves around economically and are still debt-ridden households, but there is no way to make this happen. (The cadres occupy a very small amount, and the undistributed fruits are not many). It is still a problem that needs to be solved.

　　河东地少窟窿户多
    四分之一农民缺地
  　代表穷村典型可供各地研究
    【本报消息】河东村是武安九区有名的穷村庄，灾荒年（三十一年）前，全村约五百人，一百二十余户，土地十二顷左右，每人约合二——二·五亩。当时全村约百分之八十是无地或少地的农民，这些农民的出路是给附近村庄的地主住长工、打短工，拾砍、做木工，也有跑关东的，大部分农民都负着债。河东村只有四户土地较多，但他们的极盛时代四家合计不过三百亩土地。经过双减即削弱了一部分，五四指示后，这四户中土地最多的不过五十亩，少的不足四十亩。靠这四户满足全村无地少地农民的要求是不可能的。造成地少民贫的原因，除了本村富农的剥削外，主要是附近各村（河西、石洞、田二庄）地主的地租债利的盘剥，使该村农民无法抬头，有些土地的也被抵押剥夺掉了。灾荒年除“四大家”以外，几乎是家家无口粮，人人饿肚皮。逃荒在外的约占村民十分之一。失散、饿死人口很多。贫农孟月魁全家六口，只剩了父子二人，增生全家四口饿死了一半。“要不是八路军在这里，这个灾荒年河东就全完了”，“八路军通过敌人封锁给老百姓运救济粮”，河东的群众总是念念不忘。但是这些救济粮并未完全落到群众肚里，一部分干部互相救济了。贫农孟兆顺偷吃了合作社十七颗（一说是两把）黑豆子，被扣了三天，空着肚子，只有老婆给送点开水，结果出了三亩地偿了“罚款”了事。
    灾荒年前后，附近各村地主逃避负担，地价大跌，双减后，河东村买进了相当数目的土地（以石洞村为最多）。另外县府拨给了没收汉奸的公地约四十亩，累年增加，到现在为止，土地已由原十二顷左右增至十七顷七十余亩（人口大体未动，户数由于分住的结果，增到了一百五十二户）。因之群众生活、阶级关系就起了很大的变化，从第五闾二十六户来看：四○——四二年，每人平均土地不过二·○六亩；经过双减，四三年每人平均二·七○亩；五四指示后，上升为每人平均土地三·四四亩。土地虽然增加，但贫雇农民的生活仍然很苦，五闾二十六户中，有五户土地绝对不够，占百分之二十弱。三户粮食困难，占百分之十三。十五户全无牲畜或牲畜不能用，占百分之五十七·七弱。土地最少的每人合二·一六亩，最多的四·一六亩。（三闾悬殊较大，地最少的二·○八亩，最多的六·一九亩）。此外房屋农具一般都很缺，有些没房的贫雇还未分到住房。孟宪多老两口小两口和一个孩子合住一个屋，合睡一个炕。许多房屋一下雨就无处容身。
    村里主要掌政的没有一个贫雇，村长、武委会主任、财粮主任、民事主任、合作社正副经理、优抗主任等都是多年的村干部老中农，分配果实与分派负担时干部多从自己利益上考虑，土地不是分配，而是标价出售或进行抽换，贫雇买不起，好地、近地大都落在干部手中。剩下或换出的沙卜滩地、远地、碎地再“填窟窿”。“拥护”给赤贫李小林的亩半地有十五、六块，还批评他懒，为啥不愿种。浮财果实的分配次序是抗属荣退军人，干部积极分子，最后的残余才轮到贫雇，麦保老婆五千元买个破缸抬到家不能用，牛保老头子分到个女人褂子。全村二十四户抗属，大部分是中农或新中农，分果实外加三分，都成了凸堆户。另一部分浮财不进行分配，入合作社股，及移归村财政，干部出差在此开销。干部与积极分子结成了三十二人的小集团，政治主任说：“我有了这三十二个人，什么工作都可以做下去”。他们看不见群众，群众在会议上不敢发言，怕一语不对，人家就喊口号；怕人家问：“你是个啥思想”？政治主任死了骡子，主要干部开会时觉得应该把合作社的骡子卖给他，决定后布置积极分子，在农会上“民主讨论”一番，群众看见干部发言如出一口气，就不敢吭。干部在贫雇面前摆自己的功劳，老楞子对贫雇说：“叫你提意见不敢提，分果实可有你，你知道这果实是那来的？”分果实时把老实农民当贼看，圈子不准进。说：“出去，少了东西怎么办？”前年冬天奖励积极分子，卅二个人夜间分果实，群众从门缝中看着干部抱着面缸往家走。贪污现象也很普遍，先把果实拿到合作社，过几天就到了自己家里，政治主任说：“在区上开会下决心不贪污，但见东西就想要，总要设法弄到手。”副村长自己有房还要换好房，马山娘的屋子又小又漏，下起雨来无法住，去年花了三万冀钞买了房子至今没住上。但一般的讲，如和附近村作比较，干群对立不算尖锐。农民与农民之间，有以下的问题须要加以解决：
    一、动中农思想：自去夏“挤封建”后，割韭菜思想相当普遍。土地法大纲公布后，中农又有“打乱平分”的恐惧，经过很多的宣传解释，仍有怀疑，因为本村已无地主富农可斗，又无肯定的富裕中农可动员，附近各村也无很多的“肥”可抽。一部分土地在平均数以上的中农害怕，迟迟不送粪。
    二、宗派问题：河东村有所谓“大门里”与大门外之分，大门里原是一大家，现分成十几户，大部种地兼木匠。大门外的群众认为他们有宗派，“尖头”，工作不好做；而他们则认为大门外排挤他们，会议上不敢发言。
    三、一部分贫雇农民（约占全村人口百分之二十），在经济上还未翻身，还是窟窿户，但却没有来路（干部多占数目极小，未分果实亦不多）。还是个需要解决的问题。
