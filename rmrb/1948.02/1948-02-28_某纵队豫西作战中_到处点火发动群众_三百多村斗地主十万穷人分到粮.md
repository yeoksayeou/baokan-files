　　A Certain Column's Operations in Western Henan
    Everywhere Fires are Lit to Mobilize the Masses
  　Over Three Hundred Villages Struggle Against Landlords; One Hundred Thousand Poor People are Distributed Grain
    [Taihang News] Late news from Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi: The "lighting fires" and merit-making campaign launched by the × Column led by General Qin Jiwei of the former Taihang Military Region in western Henan last winter has achieved significant results. According to the "26th Division" of the column, in the past two months, during combat movements, they "lit fires" and mobilized the masses to struggle against landlords in 376 towns and villages. Meetings were held and grain was distributed to 100,000 impoverished people, with a total distribution of 13 million catties of grain, averaging 130 catties per person; 326 mu of land belonging to landlords was distributed. During the eastward advance in November, in a 300-li stretch, they lit fires to mobilize the masses to struggle against landlords in about 20 villages in four counties, distributing over one million catties of grain. On the first day of the march, upon arriving at Shen Village, the political work group of the health department put down their backpacks and immediately sought out poor people to investigate, mobilizing impoverished tenants to move grain and clothes from the homes of landlords and rich men, and burn land deeds. When a certain regiment passed through Cai Village, Baofeng, instructor Ling Yangmin led the team to mobilize the masses to struggle against two landlord families, distributing grain and other items to impoverished households affected by disasters; the masses gratefully saw them off, calling our army "Living Dragon Kings." After the liberation of Yexian County, the five public granaries were opened simultaneously, and 20,000 poor people from the suburbs rushed to distribute 400,000 catties of grain. During the struggles, our People's Liberation Army consciously abided by discipline, even returning a pair of shoes to the poor people, and the masses praised them, saying, "They are truly the people's army."

　　某纵队豫西作战中
    到处点火发动群众
  　三百多村斗地主十万穷人分到粮
    【太行消息】豫鄂陕迟到消息：前太行区野战军秦基伟将军所率领的×纵队，去冬转战豫西中开展的“点火”立功运动，获得显著成绩。据该纵队“二六”部总结，两月来在战斗行进中“点火”发动群众斗争地主的城镇村庄有三百七十六个，开会与分地主粮食的贫苦群众达十万人，计分到粮食一千三百万斤，每人平均分粮一百三十斤；分地主的地三百二十六亩。该部在十一月东进作战中，在三百里长途中，点火发动群众斗争地主共有四个县约二十余村，分粮百余万斤。第一天行军到申村，卫生处政工组放下背包就找穷人调查，动员贫苦房东到地主老财家搬粮食、分衣服、烧毁地契。某团在路经宝丰蔡庄时，教导员凌扬民率队发动群众斗争两户地主，把粮食等分给受灾穷户；群众感激的送行，称我军为“活龙王”。解放叶县城后，五座公仓齐开，城郊两万穷人赶来分粮达四十万斤。斗争中，我人民解放军都自觉遵守纪律，连一双鞋也全归还穷人，群众纷纷称赞“真是人民的军队”。
