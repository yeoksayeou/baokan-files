    600 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Eliminated in Two Days
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] The local armed forces of the Fourth Military District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan eliminated more than 600 enemies in two days. At dawn on January 18, a unit of our Fourth Military District's local armed forces, after a 40-li raid, attacked the old nest of Li Zibin, the puppet Junxian County Security Brigade, in Beicheng Xinzhuang. After half an hour of fierce fighting, a total of more than 470 enemy personnel, including the company commander and below, were killed, wounded, or captured. Forty-two rifles and carbines, twenty-two short guns, more than 110 red-tasseled spears, four Mauser pistols, more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition, fifteen mules and horses, and five bicycles were seized. On the 19th, more than 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 117th Regiment of the 40th Army in Anyang, together with about 3,000 local returning home corps, robbed grain and conscripted soldiers in the Peicun, Dajiangman, and Wagang areas on the border of Jun (County) and Tang (Yin). Our local armed forces intercepted them at the highlands southwest of Wagang. After two hours of hand-to-hand combat, the enemy's repeated charges were repelled twice. The enemy could not hold out and retreated in a panic towards Anyang. In this battle, more than 150 enemy personnel, including Yang, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the 117th Regiment, were killed or wounded.
