    Celebrating the New Year in Shijiazhuang
    Zhang Shen, Hong Qun, Shi Ji
    Early in the morning, as the sun was just rising in the east, the sounds of gongs and drums drifted from afar. At the west entrance of Xinhua Road, groups of men, women, and children, radiating boundless joy, hurried into the main street. As reporters entered the street, the road was already filled with people. At a large gate on the north side, the railway workers' militia's Yangko team was just emerging. In a hutong to the south, newspaper vendor Old Wang was briskly striding into a doorway, with only two newspapers left in his hand. On the usually bustling Jiefang (Liberation) Street, the two-li long, three- or four-zhang wide thoroughfare was already seething with activity, a sea of heads moving, the sounds of gongs and drums shaking the heavens. Bicycles were impossible to ride, and even pushing them was difficult. Every traffic policeman's platform was crowded with people. These umbrella-shaped platforms, which pedestrians previously dared not approach, had now become human towers. Soldiers dancing the Yangko, the Da Xing Textile Factory workers' stilt walkers and Yangko team, the Ba Wang Bian (King's Whip) performance of the textile factory workers' children's school, the martial arts of the Acrobatics Association, variety shows... five or six performances filled the street. People in red and green shirts danced, sang, twisted, and laughed in the middle, while the crowds watching clapped, joyfully chatted, and the joyous sounds of thousands of people merged into a grand symphony! On the tall buildings lining both sides of the street, every window leaf and rooftop was packed with shop assistants in long gowns and melon-cap hats, bosses, old people, children, and the countless eyes of women. Photography reporters also climbed onto the roofs to quickly adjust their lenses. Every fork of every roadside tree was climbed by children, stacked like acrobats, opening their little mouths, craning their necks, shouting and laughing. The facades of every store on both sides of the street were also particularly bright compared to usual. Many newly opened stores had newly painted signs hanging high, with brightly colored goods displayed in dazzling glass windows and on the edges of counters. Inside the North China Bookstore, portraits of great people, art charts, various paintings and calligraphy... attracted the flowing crowds. In front of the North China Xinhua Bookstore, a brand-new national flag fluttered in the wind, and a sign at the entrance advertised "Big Sale for Seven Days, All Items 20% Off." Many shops had new couplets posted. In front of the Municipal Government, a tall archway made of cypress branches inlaid with various colored light bulbs was erected, with a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging high in the center. On the gate were huge, bright red couplets: "Build Shijiazhuang, Protect Industry and Commerce." An old gentleman in the crowd at the entrance looked up in quiet observation. Next door, at the People's Education Center, people squeezed in and out, vying to see the comic strip paintings, news photos, and the list of war trophies from the self-defense war on the four walls inside. Under a painting of peasants excavating a landlord's hidden hoard, an old woman and two women were talking as they watched. A young textile factory worker immediately read the explanation under the painting to them. The old woman said, "Serves him right, hoarding the money of the poor! It should be dug up and distributed to the poor!" In front of a barbershop opposite the People's Education Center, four merchants stood side by side on the steps. When reporters asked them if the New Year under the rule of the Chiang bandits last year was lively, they vied to say, "There were performances, but all those putting on the performances were soldiers. It wasn't like this now, with the workers happily dancing and singing. Back then, workers weren't given any recognition. And those watching couldn't just casually approach. If you got too close, you'd get hit with a stick or sprayed with cold water!"
    Right at the eastern end of this bustling Zhongshan Road, in front of the Fountain Pool, two oil paintings, each over a zhang tall, of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, stood side by side, overlooking the countless laughing and shouting people in the city. From the bottom of everyone's heart, they cheered and silently praised the people's leader, Chairman Mao!
    Right in front of these portraits, the Yangko team of the United University Art Troupe was surrounded by a circle of ten thousand people. To the south and north, forty or fifty bicycles were piled together, with people standing on top of them. The large Yangko performance of over thirty people, the flower drum performance of a man and a woman, the victory drum performance of over twenty people, the cheerful, magnificent, and confident melodies, the clear words, accompanied by the soaring accompaniment, and the rhythmic drumbeats, stirred the emotions of every spectator, causing them to boil over.
    The Yangko team of the United University Art Troupe turned to Nanma Road, and the crowd followed to Nanma Road. Here, a large number of small vendors, hearing the sound of the drums approaching, quickly packed up their stalls. As the red flag of the Yangko team moved forward on the road, countless spectators in the southwest ran and sat down in a large circle, erupting in thunderous applause.
    The music from the recently opened Dan Gui Theater to the east echoed the festivities. The head of the Innovation Theater Troupe told reporters: Today, they sold two hundred more tickets than usual, and they are also preparing to perform the newly staged "Forced to Join Liangshan" to comfort the troops.
    Passing through Huayuan Street, the crowds surged and vendors were busy. A large wine vat was marked with a red paper advertisement: "Celebrating the New Year, Big Blowout Sale." The couplet on one shop was: "The shop owner is amiable and business is good, Democratic construction of Shijiazhuang." In a hutong, the doorway of a former head of a poverty relief group was adorned with the couplet: "Work together to build a revolutionary home, Only collective production can improve life." Not far from this house, a five- or six-year-old girl was holding a piece of pork, and two other children with her told me: "It's New Year's! We're going to eat something good at home, Dad just bought it." Walking from here onto a small street that led to Zhongshan Road, it was relatively quiet. A small vendor sat quietly in the sunlight next to the street, looking at the Chairman Mao's report printed in red in this newspaper. He said: "What the Chairman said about dividing the land equally and reorganizing the troops is really good!" As he finished speaking, he continued to examine a section about the issues of industry and commerce.
    In the southwest, a burst of gongs and drums, along with the noise of the crowd, turned into the west entrance of Zhongshan Road again.
    The noises from all directions continued to sound, the flow of people was in motion, and Shijiazhuang was moving forward.

    石家庄过新年
    张深  洪群  石基
    清早，太阳刚从东方升起，锣鼓声远远传来。新华路西口，一群一群的男女小孩洋溢着无限的欢快，匆忙的赶进大街。当记者走入街口，人已经填满了马路，路北一个大门口，铁路工人纠察队的秧歌队刚走出来，南面胡同里，报贩王老头急急的迈进一家门口。他拿的报纸已只剩下了两份。在平日最热闹的解放大街，那二里多长三、四丈宽的大街已经沸腾起来了，万头钻动，锣鼓震天。脚踏车没法骑，推着也难挤动，每个交通警的岗台上都站满了人，这以前行人不敢接近的伞状的岗台如今都变成了一座座的人塔。战士跳的秧歌舞，大兴纱厂工人的高跷、秧歌队，纱厂职工子弟学校的霸王鞭，杂技联合会的武术，杂耍……五、六起玩艺排满街道，穿着红绿衫衣的人们在中间跳着、唱着、扭着、笑着，看的人群阵阵的鼓掌、欢悦的说笑、千万个人的快乐的声音汇成一股宏大交响巨流！街两旁重叠的高楼上，每个楼窗的合叶和楼的顶端都挤满了长衫瓜帽的店员、老板和老人、小孩、妇女的千万只眼睛。摄影记者也爬上楼顶迅速的拨转镜头，路旁每棵道树的槎叉都爬上了小孩子，象叠罗汉一样，用各种各样的姿态，张开小嘴，伸着脖子，嚷着笑着。大街两边各个商店的门面也比往日特别鲜亮，很多新开的店铺门口都高挂新漆的招牌，鲜艳的货品陈列在耀眼的玻璃橱里和台柜前缘。北新书局的门面内，伟人像、美术图表、各种书画……，吸引着流动的人们，华北新华书店的楼前，崭新的国旗迎风摆动，门口贴着“大减价七天，一律八折”的广告。许多店铺都贴出新联，在市政府门口，扎起高大镶着各色灯泡的柏枝牌楼，毛主席的画像高悬正中，大门上贴着鲜红的巨幅：“建设石家庄，保护工商业”的新联，门口人群里，一位老先生仰头静观。隔壁的民众教育馆，人们挤进挤出，争看室内四壁的连环彩画、新闻照片和自卫战争的缴获表。在一幅农民发掘地主窖藏的画下，一位老太太和两个妇人边看边说，旁边一个纱厂青工马上给他们念了画下的说明，老太太说道：“真该，看他闹的穷人的钱藏起来，该刨出来分给穷人！”在民教馆对面的一家理发馆门前，四个商人并列在台阶上，记者问到他们去年的今天，蒋匪统治的年节是否热闹，他们争着说：“也有玩艺，但是，闹玩艺的全是军人，没有现在这样，工人们高兴的扭唱，那时候不提高工人啊，看的人也不能这么随便，一靠前就被棍子打和冷水喷！”
    就在这热闹的中山路的东尽头，喷水池的前面，两幅丈多高的毛主席和朱总司令的油画新像并列着，在俯视着这个城市里万千个欢笑叫闹人众的行列，从每个人的心底，欢呼着、默颂着人民的领袖毛主席啊！
    就在这像的前面，联大文工团的秧歌队被围成了一个万人的大圈子，南边和北边，四、五十辆自行车扔到一堆，车子上面也都站起了人，三十多人的大秧歌，男女两人的打花鼓，二十多人的胜利摇鼓，愉快的、雄壮的、自信的曲调，清晰的字音，配着高扬的伴奏乐律，整齐的咚咚的鼓声，把每个观众的心情，鼓舞得滚沸起来。
    联大文工团的秧歌队转到南马路，人群也跟到南马路。这里，一大片小摊贩刚听到鼓声近来就赶紧收拾起了货摊，秧歌队的红旗还在马路上前进的时候，西南面无数的观众就飞跑围坐成一个大圈，掀起了雷动的掌声。
    东面新开张不久的丹桂剧院的乐声呼应着，革新剧社的负责人告诉记者：今天多卖了二百多张票，晚上还准备演出新排的“逼上梁山”慰劳部队。
    行经花园街时，人群挤动，摊贩忙碌，一个卖酒的大篓上标志着“庆祝新年大甩卖”的红纸广告，一家店铺的对联是：“店东两和买卖好，民主建设石家庄”。在一条胡同里，一个前些日当过贫民小组长的家门口，贴着“一齐劳动建设革命家务，大家生产才能改善生活”的对联。离这家不远，一个五、六岁的小姑娘怀里抱着一块猪肉，和她在一起的两个小孩告诉我说：“过年啦！家里要吃好的，爹才买回的”，从这里往中山路上走过的一条小街，比较清静，街旁一个小摊贩静坐在阳光下看着红色印就的本报所刊毛主席报告，他说：“主席说的这平分土地和整顿队伍真好！”这时，说罢他又在细看着关于工商业问题的一段。
    西南边，一阵锣鼓和着人群的噪杂声又转进中山路的西口来了。
    四面八方的喧闹声仍在响动，人流在旋转、石家庄在行进。
