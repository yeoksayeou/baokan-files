　　North Jiabi Cadres Should Seriously Reflect
  　Using Fruits of Struggle and Donations to Run a Troupe
  　Making the Masses Produce for the Village Finances To the Editor:
    The North Jiabi Troupe of Cixian County, with the support of the village Farmers' Association Chairman Lan Qifu and militia instructor Li Yongfang, used the clothes, fabrics, and silks obtained from the fruits of struggle in the past to make costumes for performing. Last spring, they also took four or five shi of rice and wheat from the fruits of struggle, without informing the masses, to feed the troupe. These two frequently mobilized the masses to donate money. Now they are planning to mobilize 500,000 yuan to buy theatrical trunks. New middle peasant Lan Xicun (manager of the Production and Rejuvenation Goods Station of the district organization) donated 5,000 yuan, and loudly complained. Poor peasant Lan Fengcheng was called in by the Farmers' Association Chairman who said, "Aren't you going to give 5,000 yuan? You just wait and see!" Then he wrote down 5,000 yuan. Following this, donations of 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 yuan were written down one after another. It is estimated that each street can be "mobilized" for 80,000 to 100,000 yuan (there are six streets in total). The child of poor peasant Lin Fengyou, named Heizi, joined the troupe, and his mother complained, "I was angered to death after my child joined the troupe." Because the troupe's education of them is very poor, turning the children into petty hooligans. We know that the higher authorities have repeatedly strictly prohibited districts and villages from privately mobilizing people's money to reduce the burden on the people. This village is a disaster area, so this behavior is even more a violation of the orders of the higher authorities and the interests of the masses, and should be corrected.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cixian County Cooperative Communication Group, Bai Zenghao, Yifu To the Editor:
    Last October, the cadres of North Jiabi Village ordered small mutual aid groups in each street to produce for the village's finances, allocating 100,000 yuan to each street, with a deadline of 50,000 yuan to be completed by the end of December. Poor peasant Lin Fengcheng of the restaurant group in the first street said, "If it's not completed, we'll have to compensate them!" Later, after opposition from various parties, the task of 1.45 million yuan was reduced to 600,000 yuan. Lin Qinghai, the Anti-Conscription Director of the first street, and Lin Huafu, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, organized a sheep slaughtering group last winter, requiring the four small cooperatives to invest 250,000 yuan. The restaurant group planned to invest their share of the village finance money into the sheep slaughtering group, but the cadres said, "That won't work." They had to invest an additional 50,000 yuan. This sheep slaughtering group increased waste for the village. The above-mentioned cadre's style of ordering small cooperatives to invest should be changed.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cixian County Cooperative, Bai Zenghao, Yifu
    Using the fruits of struggle to organize a troupe is a fundamental violation of the spirit of the Land Law. Indiscriminately apportioning funds to the masses to buy theatrical trunks is an intolerable waste. Ordering small mutual aid groups of the masses to complete the tasks of village finance also violates the correct principle of developing production to solve village financial expenditures. This kind of thing is probably not limited to one village of North Jiabi. It is hoped that all localities will check it out and correct it immediately.

　　北贾壁干部应好好反省
  　用果实和捐款搞剧团
  　让群众给村财政生产编辑同志：
    磁县北贾壁剧团，在本村农会长兰其富、民兵指导员李用方支持下，过去将斗争果实的衣服和布匹绸缎，做成唱戏衣服。去年春天还拿斗争果实米麦四、五石，没经群众知道，给剧团吃了。这两人经常向群众动员款洋。现在正计划动员五十万元买戏箱。新中农兰喜存（是分区机关生产复兴货栈经理）出了五千元，大喊冤枉。贫农兰凤成被农会长叫去说：“你还不拿五千元？你们看吧！”就给写了五千元。以下的有三千、二千、一千都写开了。每街估计能“动员”八万到十万元（共有六街）。贫农吝凤有孩子名叫黑子，参加了剧团，他娘告人说：“自我孩子参加剧团后，就气死我了。”因为剧团对他们教育很差，将小孩都教成了小流氓了。我们知道上级几次严禁区村私自动员民款，以减轻人民负担。本村是个灾荒区，更是违犯上级命令和群众利益的行为，应注意纠正。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　磁县县联社通讯小组白增孝、一夫编辑同志：
    去年十月底，北贾壁村干部命令各街小型互助组，给村财政生产，每街分十万元，限期十二月底完成五万元。一街饭铺组贫农吝凤成说：“完不成也得给人家赔咧！”后来经过各方反对，才把一百四五十万元的任务留下六十万元。一街抗勤主任吝清海、农会常委吝华福，去冬组织杀羊组，要四组小型社投资二十五万元。饭铺小组准备将自己接受的村财政款投到杀羊组，干部说：“那不行。”只得另外投去五万元。这个杀羊组给村上增加了浪费。以上干部命令小型社投资的作风，应该改变。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　磁县县联社白增孝、一夫
    用斗争果实组织剧团，根本违犯土地法的精神，向群众乱派款项买戏箱，更是不能容许的浪费现象。命令群众小型互助组完成村财政的任务，也违背了发展生产解决村财政开支的正确原则。这种事情恐不止北贾壁一个村有，希望各地都来检查一下，即刻纠正。
