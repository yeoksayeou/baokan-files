    Anyang Local Armed Forces
    Liberate Over Two Hundred Members of the Honghetun Society
    Ye County Troops and Militia Eliminate Three Thousand Bandits in Six Months

    [Taihang News] (Delayed) The militia and work teams of the Fourth District of Anyang, in coordination with a unit of the "Yangtze" troops, liberated over two hundred members of the Honghetun Society. On the night of the 26th of last month, we advanced on Honghetun in two routes. One route, composed of a unit of our "Yangtze" troops, the South Joint Defense Militia of the Fourth District, and the district cadre team, pressed towards the front gate of the society's headquarters from the southwest of Honghetun. The other route, composed of the work team and the North Joint Defense Militia, pressed towards the back gate of the society's headquarters from the northwest of Honghetun. The two routes coordinated to completely resolve the Chiang bandit society. Over two hundred people were captured alive, three were killed or wounded, and over one hundred and fifty spears and guns were seized. While we were resolving the society, the enemy pseudo-Cixian County Security Regiment stationed in Dougong counterattacked us three times, but were all repelled.

    Editor's Note: These societies were deceived by the Chiang bandits and became tools for the Chiang bandits to oppose the people. Therefore, after we liberate them, we should educate them well and then release them to return home to divide the land with the masses.

    [Taihang News] The Fifth Military Sub-district's Ye County Headquarters recently announced the glorious achievements of the county's troops, militia, and district cadre teams in eliminating over three thousand enemies in the latter half of last year. The army and people of Ye County gloriously completed the great combat mission of besieging the isolated island enemies and continuously annihilating the invading enemies after the Liu-Deng army went south last summer, persisting in the border struggle. In the past six months, a total of 646 battles were fought, and 271 battles were fought in coordination with the troops, totaling 917 battles. A total of 3,246 Chiang bandits, local bullies, and puppet bandits were eliminated. A total of 994 Chiang diehards and puppet troops were killed or wounded, 1,155 Chiang diehard spies, traitors, and armed bullies were captured alive. Amidst our mass political offensive, we won over the disintegration of 764 diehard puppet troops and other enemy personnel (including 256 diehard puppet troops, who brought back two machine guns and a number of rifles), captured 333 Chiang personnel such as maintenance members, and crushed 16 Chiang-linked village societies behind enemy lines. We seized six light machine guns, 206 rifles, 167 pistols, over 44,000 rounds of ammunition of various types, 2,982 hand grenades, over 100,000 catties of grain, over 80 head of livestock, and 100,067,100 yuan in Chiang currency. Sixteen armed groups were also established behind enemy lines, and under the slogan of "one hand holding a gun, one hand dividing the land," helped the masses to divide more than 300 mu of land, divide 341 shi of grain, more than 12,000 catties of cotton, and 1,767 pieces of clothing and furniture.

    安阳地方武装
    解放洪河屯会门二百
    邺县营兵民兵半年歼匪三千
    【太行消息】（迟到）安阳四区民兵武工队，配合“长江”部队一部，解放洪河屯会门二百多人。上月廿六日夜，我分两路逼进洪河屯；一路由我“长江”部队一部配合四区南联防民兵及区干队，从洪河屯西南进逼会门驻地的前门；一路由武工队配合北联防民兵，从洪河屯西北逼进会门驻地之后门，两路协同夹攻，将蒋匪会门全部解决。活捉二百来人，毙伤三人，缴获矛枪一百五十余支。在我解决会门中，驻豆公之敌伪磁县保安团曾向我反扑三次，都被打退。
    编者按：这些会门，都因受了蒋匪欺骗，成了蒋匪反人民的工具。因此，我们解放他们后，应很好对他们教育，以后释放回家，和群众一道分田。
    【太行消息】五分区邺县指挥部，顷公布该县营兵、民兵、区干队等去年后半年歼敌三千余人的辉煌战绩。邺县军民光荣的完成了去夏刘邓大军南下后，围困孤岛敌人及不断歼灭出犯敌人，坚持边地斗争的伟大战斗任务。半年来共作战六百四十六次，配合部队作战二百七十一次，总计作战九百一十七次。共歼灭蒋匪土顽伪匪等三千二百四十六名。计毙伤蒋顽伪军九百九十四名，活捉蒋顽伪特、奸霸武装等一千一百五十五名；在我群众性的政治攻势声中，争取瓦解顽伪军及敌方其它人员共七百六十四人（内有顽伪军二百五十六人，它们并带回机枪两挺及步枪一部），捕捉维持分子等蒋方人员三百三十三名，摧垮敌后蒋联庄会门等十六个。缴获轻机枪六挺，步枪二百零六支，短枪一百六十七支，各种子弹四万四千来发，手榴弹二千九百八十二颗，粮食十万余斤，牲口八十多头，蒋币一万万零六百七十一万元。并曾建立了十六个敌后武装小组，在“一手拿枪，一手分田”的口号下，帮助群众分田三百多亩，分粮三百四十一石，棉花一万二千多斤，衣服家具一千七百六十七件。
