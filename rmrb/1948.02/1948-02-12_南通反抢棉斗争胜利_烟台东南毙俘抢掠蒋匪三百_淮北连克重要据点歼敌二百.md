    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th: The anti-cotton seizure struggle of 30,000 soldiers and civilians in the Sanyu District of Nantong, which lasted for two months, has now come to an end. It is estimated that 99.5% of public cotton and over 70% of private cotton have been preserved. In early November of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits transferred a battalion of Shanghai tax police, two companies of county security teams, and a regiment of the reorganized 21st Division, totaling more than 2,000 people, and in collusion with landlords and local bullies who had fled to Nantong, Shanghai, and other places, under the supervision of Zhang Yeli, the director of the Shanghai branch of the bandit Central Bank, entered the Sanyu District of Nantong, the second largest cotton producing area in the country, to set up eight strongholds and carry out stationed seizure. Our Ninth Sub-district military and civilians immediately launched a full-scale anti-cotton seizure movement. At the end of November, a unit of our local armed forces captured Liuqiao in Tongxi (Nantong West). In December, the Central China Liberation Army counter-attacked the Jue (Gang) Ma (Tang) line, threatening the bandit and puppet forces in various strongholds. The district and township guerrillas actively moved through the heart of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, repelling the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who seized cotton dozens of times. More than a thousand young people jumped into the blockade to transport cotton, while strictly controlling feudal forces, eliminating traitors and counter-revolutionaries, cutting off the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' ears and eyes, and launching anti-Baоjia and anti-rumor struggles. By the end of last month, when our local armed forces captured Shigang in Nantong, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Beixinqiao, Jiuzhongzha, and other strongholds fled in panic, leaving only the bandit and puppet forces in the Sanyu stronghold, trapped and awaiting death.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th: More than 1,000 men of the 42nd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Eighth Army in Yantai, carrying more than 200 large and small vehicles, set out to plunder on the 25th of last month and were completely defeated by our army in the Sunjiatan and Kongjiatan areas more than 20 miles southeast of Yantai city. It is estimated that more than 120 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and 184 bandits, including bandit Lieutenant Staff Officer Yu Yijun, were captured alive, and 186 large and small vehicles were seized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 8th: Delayed news: The Huaibei People's Liberation Army continuously captured important enemy strongholds between January 21st and 25th, eliminating more than 200 enemies. The details are as follows: 1. Caiwei, more than 50 miles south of Suqian city, was captured, and the entire puppet Suqian security squadron was wiped out, capturing 114 enemies, including 8 enemy squadron leaders and "Communist Suppression" captains. 2. Pogou was captured, capturing more than 50 enemies. 3. Youji in the north of Lingbi was captured, and the three puppet township offices of Youji, Liuzhai, and Yugou, as well as dozens of puppet district captains, were wiped out, killing 20 enemies. A total of eight light and heavy machine guns, 156 rifles, four gun magazines, and a quantity of ammunition were seized in the three battles.
