    Severe Famine in Chengjie Village
    Hoping the Government Will Find a Solution

    To the Editor:
    The famine in Chengjie Village, Second District of Xingtai, is already very serious. The village is surrounded by sand dunes on three sides and farmland on one side. There are a total of 180 households in the village, and currently 42 households have nothing to eat. Some are boiling locust pods with beans to eat. Needless to say, they won't be eating dumplings for the New Year.

    In previous years, making incense (superstitious items) was a major source of income for the villagers. This year, because the masses' awareness has increased and they oppose superstition, selling incense is banned everywhere, so this business can no longer be done. Relying on spinning cotton and weaving cloth, the profit is too low due to the widespread development of textile production. They lack capital to engage in sideline occupations and cannot make money. In addition, poor peasants and hired laborers have had four cattle and donkeys die of leanness this winter due to lack of grass and fodder. Recently, they borrowed 220,000 yuan from the bank, but due to the severity of the famine, it cannot solve the basic difficulties of the masses. Now, many dependents of revolutionary soldiers and poor peasants are finding the cadres every day, asking to solve their difficulties, making the cadres so worried that they can't even lift their heads. Hoping the government can find a solution!
        Sincerely,
        Xingtai Industry and Commerce Bureau, Li Yunxuan, January 30th

    城界村灾荒严重
    希望政府设法解决编辑同志：
    邢台二区城界村灾荒已很严重。该村三面沙滩，一面土地。全村共一百八十户，刻下已有四十二户没有吃的。有的煮槐连豆吃。不用说，过年吃不上饺子了。
    该村群众往年做香（迷信品）是一项大的收入。今年因群众觉悟提高，反对迷信，到处禁卖香，这个买卖做不成了。依靠纺花织布，又因普遍开展纺织，利润过低。搞副业没有资本，不能赚钱。另外，贫雇今冬因无草无料，瘦死了牛驴四头。最近在银行贷了二十二万元款，因灾荒严重，不能解决群众基本困难。现在每天有许多抗属和贫雇找干部，要求解决困难，把干部愁的头也抬不起来。希望政府想个办法！    此致敬礼
