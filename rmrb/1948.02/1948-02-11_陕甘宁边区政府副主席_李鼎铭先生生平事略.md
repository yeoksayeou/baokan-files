Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th: Li Dingming, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, unfortunately passed away on December 11th of last year. Representatives from all circles in the Northwest will establish a funeral committee and have decided to hold a memorial service in a certain location in northern Shaanxi on February 25th. His biography is announced as follows: Vice Chairman Li, named Fenggong, courtesy name Dingming, was born on September 28th, 1881, in Taohuamao Village, Mizhi County. In his youth, his family was poor and unable to afford teachers, so he studied at the home of his maternal uncle, Mr. Du Douyuan (a former Qing Dynasty scholar), where he read extensively in the classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections. He was particularly skilled in sciences such as geography, mathematics, astronomy, and meteorology, and even made his own globes and astronomical instruments to calculate solar and lunar eclipses. In the late Qing Dynasty, he established free schools and promoted social welfare activities such as foot binding prohibition and gambling prohibition. In 1910, he was hired as a teacher at Suide Middle School. After the Xinhai Revolution, he founded elementary schools in his home county, broke superstitions, accepted temple property to enrich school funds, improved teaching methods, lectured on scientific knowledge, and encouraged students to engage in extracurricular labor, growing their own vegetables and building their own dormitories. After four years of operation, the results were remarkable. In 1917, he was hired as a teacher at Yulin Middle School, teaching courses such as Chinese language, history, geography, and mathematics. In 1923, he served as the head of the advisory section of the Yulin Daoyin Office, and in 1926, he returned to his hometown due to illness. In addition to vigorously promoting local public welfare undertakings, he also used his medical practice to support his life, while reading extensively. As a result, his knowledge and thinking improved day by day. In his later years, Mr. Li accepted revolutionary ideas. After the July 7th Incident, he supported the Communist Party's call for unity and resistance against Japan and opposed Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and anti-people policies. He often said: "The Communist Party does things for the people and will surely win in the future. Chiang Kai-shek is anti-communist and anti-people and will surely fail in the future." In 1941, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region conducted a general election, and Mr. Li was elected as the speaker of the Mizhi County Council and a member of the Border Region Council. In the winter of that year, he was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government at the Second Session of the Border Region Council, until his death. Since taking office, he supported the New Democratic policies, advocated streamlining administration and reducing troops, and vigorously promoted the development of production through intensive farming, immigration and land reclamation, cotton planting and afforestation. After several years of the great production movement in the Border Region, the people's lives have been greatly improved. He excitedly said: "Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I am willing to dedicate my aging body to the country and the nation." In the past seven years, he has made many contributions to the construction of the Border Region. He once said to Chinese and foreign reporters who came to Yan'an for investigation: "Some individuals at home and abroad say that the Border Region government is controlled and monopolized by the Communist Party. I think this is ridiculous. If you want to find control and monopoly, you can only find it among the domestic and foreign dictators. We have established a democratic coalition government where everyone has a job and a right." Mr. Li was very concerned about the national political situation. Whenever the situation turned for the worse, he was filled with righteous indignation and resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial, civil war, and traitorous policies, and shouted loudly to strive for peace and democracy. He strongly agreed with the Outline Land Law of China, and in his last words he still said, "The Communist Party's launch of the masses to thoroughly and equally distribute the land, and the review of cadres and party members, are two extremely great policies. With these two policies, it will be guaranteed that the Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese revolution will surely be victorious." At about 10:00 p.m. on December 9, 1947, Vice Chairman Li suddenly suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage. The Border Region Government invited doctors Zhang Jiefu, Yan Huashan, Shen Jizhong, Gao Feng and Li Zhensan (Chinese medicine doctor) his eldest son, for two consultations and Li Zhensan personally treated him, but due to the severity of the illness, the medicine was ineffective, and he passed away at 6:00 a.m. on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Border Region Government, Chang Lifu, and Li Zhensan and Li Zhiji, the eldest and fourth sons of Vice Chairman Li, personally supervised the encoffining. On the 14th, the coffin was transported back to Mizhi, his hometown. Along the way, the masses offered condolences and sacrifices in an endless stream. On the 16th, it arrived home, and was buried on the 19th. Vice Chairman Li lived to be 67 years old. He is survived by four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Zhensan, is currently working at the Border Region Industrial Cooperative Office. The second son, Liguo, a member of the Communist Party, is currently working at the Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters in Harbin. The third son, Li Dafu, a member of the Communist Party, works at the Suide Partition Commissioner's Office. There are nine grandsons and six granddaughters, four of whom have already joined the revolutionary work.
