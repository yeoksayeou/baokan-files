  　Reflections from the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting
  　Comrade Yang Zhaohai's Reflection
    Becoming an Official and Enjoying Comfort, Forgetting the Peasants
    (Born to a poor peasant/hired hand family, 27 years old, joined the Party in June 1943, started working in July, currently district chief of Anyang First District.)
    I am from Anyang First District. My childhood was hard; I lived in poverty. When I was seventeen, my father died, and there was little to eat at home. Seeing the landlord Yang Huaiwu in my village as the captain, riding a white horse and carrying a box cannon, I was very envious. When I was twenty-four, I lived as a hired hand in Xin'an, and the landlord's child carried a "Type 38" rifle and a box cannon, looking very impressive. I thought to myself, one day I, a poor hired hand, could also strut around with a box cannon.
    In 1942, hired hands got a raise in wages. In 1943, I had 22 mu of land, so I stopped being a hired hand and started as a militiaman. I was an activist during the struggle meetings, but I always thought it would be more impressive to be a district cadre leading a team with a box cannon. In July, I went to the Public Security Bureau and, with a gun on my hip, became impressive. Every time I went home, the neighbors would say that my brother and I were the "Stone Dragon and Stone Tiger brothers." I often thought of going home and showing off. After becoming a cadre, carrying a gun, and knowing a few words, I thought there was something to be gained from the revolution. At this time, seeing others confiscating a lot of things, I thought that being honest was a disadvantage, and I developed the idea of equipping myself. I felt that if I didn't grab something, it wouldn't be worth it. I grabbed a watch and was criticized, and I thought, "Why is it that everyone else grabs a lot, but you only see me?" I didn't realize that I shouldn't have been learning from others' mistakes. In the Fourth District, seeing that others were better dressed than me, I felt rustic, so I made clothes out of the cheap foreign cloth I bought. In Zhaizhuang, I confiscated a lot of things and grabbed another watch. At this time, I started to become "Westernized." Others had carts, so I also grabbed a cart. Once I had a cart, I would even ride it to peasants' homes to eat. One time, on the street, some peasants called out to me, "Old Yang, Old Yang!" wanting to talk to me. I rode past on my cart, pretending not to hear. I also wanted to live in a more "Westernized" house. I put blankets and sheets on the bed, and when meetings were held, others didn't dare to sit on it. I thought it was pretty good. After equipping myself, I wanted to equip my family and make my home more impressive. I was afraid people would laugh at me if I looked as shabby as before. I sent desks, chairs, and a mirror home. After having desks, chairs, and a house, I thought the walls were too dark and wanted to move to a place on flat ground since I lived on the edge of the village. The year before last, in October, when I was studying in Yuzhong, some classmates planned to pass by my house. I felt that my home was not impressive enough and would be embarrassing, so I quickly wrote home, asking them to borrow a nice house and decorate it before my classmates arrived. When I was engaged in production at the Lianzhong, I was pushing cabbage and sweating profusely to Nanguan (Linxian). I ran into some cadres from my village. My face turned red, and I felt very embarrassed, afraid that others would say I had made a mistake and how would I face them when I went home? I quickly stopped the cart at Nanguan and told the cadres that I was producing, and only then did I feel relieved. I considered labor not to be honorable. Because I was the district chief, I only wanted to learn from the former "captain." Before coming back to study this time, I even wanted to make myself a military uniform, a leather coat, and buy a harmonica (I already bought it) so that I could go to my wife's family during the New Year and let them know that I was presentable. At the same time, I often wanted to put on airs, only wanting to hold big meetings so that the masses would all know that I was the district chief. I took a messenger with me when I went to the countryside, but I didn't dare to show off too much, afraid that people would figure out my background and know that I was a hired hand. I thought that as long as others were afraid of me, everything would be easy to handle. I started by scolding the cooks and messengers, and then I scolded the district and village cadres, making them look fierce so that they wouldn't be afraid of not completing anything they were assigned to do.
    In my work, I did not have a clear class viewpoint. I held the idea of "eating from someone, protecting someone" like a hired hand. In order to show that I was carrying out orders, resolutely completing tasks, and showing myself off, I harmed the masses. After this reflection, I realized that I had forgotten my roots after turning over and had taken the old road. I started by hating the landlords for the sake of the masses, but after becoming a cadre and an official, I forgot my poor brothers.

  　太行五地委整党会的反省
  　杨兆海同志反省
    作官享福忘了农民
    （贫雇出身，现年二十七岁，四三年六月入党，七月参加工作，现任安阳一区区长。）
    我是安阳一区人，小时光景不好，过的穷天气。十七岁那年，俺爹死了，家里没啥吃。看到俺村地主杨怀吾当队长，骑着白马，带着盒子枪，自己很眼气。二十四岁那年在新安住觅汉，主家孩子背着“三八式”，带着盒子枪，看得非常排场；想想自己是个穷觅汉，那天也能带着盒子枪抖起来。
    四二年觅汉增资，四三年有了廿二亩地，就不住觅汉了，开始当民兵。斗争时是积极分子，但想总不如当个区干队带上盒子威风。七月到了公安局，带上手枪，就威风起来了。每次回家邻家都说我和俺哥是石龙石虎二弟兄，这样常想回家抖一抖威风。当了干部，带上了枪，又识几个字，想到革命还是有个赚头。这时见到别人抓的东西多，自己想到老实吃亏，就产生了装备思想，觉得不抓一把不够本，抓了一个表受了批评，心想别人抓的多为什么光看见我了？没有认识自己不该学习别人的错误。在四区见别人比自己穿的好，觉得土气，就把贱买的洋布做衣服。在翟庄，大抓东西，又抓一个手表。这时开始“洋”起来了。别人有车子，我也抓了个车子，有了车子，到老百姓家吃饭也骑上车子去。有一回在街上老百姓喊我：“老杨老杨”！想给我谈话。我骑着车子，装个没听见，就过去了。住的房子也老想洋气点，在床上铺的毯子、单子，开会时别人不敢往上坐，我觉得还不错。装备了自己就想装备家，把家闹的排场点，当了干部还象从前一样破烂，怕人家笑话。把桌椅镜子，送到家里，有了桌椅房子，又嫌墙黑了，又住在村边，就想搬到平地上住。前年十月，我在豫中学习，有几个同学准备路过我家，心觉家里不排场，见不得人，赶快往家写信，让他们借个好房子，摆设一下，等同学们路过。在联中搞生产，推着白菜满头流汗到南关（林县），碰到俺村几个干部，自己一脸红，觉得很丢人，怕别人说我是犯了错误，以后回家怎样见人？赶快把车子停在南关，又找见干部告诉他们说是生产的，这才放了心，我把劳动看成不是光荣的。因为自己当了区长，就光想学习过去的“队长”。这次回来学习前，还想做一身军装，作个皮大衣，买个口琴（已经买了），过年时和老婆一块到丈人家去，叫他们也知道我象个样。同时自己又常想摆个架子，光想开大会，叫群众都认识我是区长。下乡带上通讯员，可是又不敢装，怕人家摸我的底，知道我是个觅汉，就觉得只要别人怕我，啥事也好办。开始先训火夫、通讯员，后来就训区村干部，叫他们看着厉害，干啥事也不怕完不成。
    我在工作中没有明确阶级观点，是抱着“吃谁保谁”当觅汉的思想，为了表示执行命令，坚决完成任务，显示自己，害了群众。这回我反省后，认识了翻身忘本，走了一条老道路，开始仇恨地主为群众，后来当了干部做了官，忘了自己穷弟兄。
