    [Taihang News] In many districts and villages in Licheng and other places, the poor and hired peasants are at the core, uniting with middle peasants to hold meetings of poor and middle peasant associations or family-style discussions to deeply discuss the spirit of the Land Law, which has played a significant role in stabilizing middle peasants and uniting all peasants. When the Land Law was first promulgated, some middle peasants did not understand it, and landlords and rich peasants spread rumors and sabotage, causing some middle peasants, especially wealthier middle peasants, to experience panic and anxiety, as well as wasteful and unproductive behavior. The local leadership discovered these problems and promptly proposed that, in addition to in-depth publicity among poor and hired peasants, publicity to middle peasants must also be strengthened so that all peasants can generally understand the Land Law and unite to thoroughly realize equal distribution. In the second, fourth, and sixth districts of Licheng, as well as in certain villages in She County, Wuxiang, Huguan, and Pingshun, meetings of poor and middle peasant associations and family meetings were held successively. First, the poor and hired peasants discussed uniting with middle peasants while studying the Land Law, and then, at family meetings, they explained the Land Law to the middle peasants, mobilized the middle peasants to talk and eliminate misunderstandings, so that the middle peasants truly understood the relationship between equal distribution and themselves. At the meeting of poor and hired peasants in Dougong Village, Sixth District of She County, it was clearly stated that, in order to thoroughly eliminate feudalism and do a good job of equal distribution, in addition to the leadership of the poor and hired peasants, it is necessary to unite with the middle peasants. Poor peasant Liu Shuke said: "Since we want to be in charge and be the masters, we must be careful, never say unreasonable things, handle things well, and not let the landlords and feudal elements get away with anything. In addition, we must not strike at our own people." Liu Jincai added: "We must remember to resolutely unite with the middle peasants." After the discussion among the poor and hired peasants, a meeting of middle and poor peasants was held in the village to explain the Land Law to the middle peasants. After hearing this, wealthy middle peasant Liu Shuxin boldly said: "Ha! So that's how it is, I'm not afraid anymore. When I first heard about equal distribution, I thought it was our turn, that I was about to be eliminated. I had no choice, I was going to sell my little donkey and buy some white flour and meat to eat and run away with my mother. Tonight, after listening to the Land Law, I can rest assured. My idea was wrong, I want to work hard and gather firewood." At the meeting of middle and poor peasants in Sunjiazhuang, Xiangyuan, some middle peasants had the idea of being afraid of being struggled against. The poor and hired peasants then proposed: "We are not struggling against 'having', but against exploitation. Labor and feudalism cannot be confused. Middle peasants are also laborers who are exploited. It is also a matter of consultation for upper-middle peasants to take out some surplus land, it is definitely not a struggle, and floating wealth will not be touched at all." After discussion, the middle peasants felt at ease. Liu Erhai, a middle peasant in Xicun, Sixth District of Licheng, heard about equal distribution and thought that everything would be messed up and distributed in baskets and baskets on the street, so he began to waste a lot. After the explanation by the poor and hired peasants, he said very emotionally: "I was too confused, thanks to you for saying it early, otherwise I would have fallen into the pit." Wang Shengtian's mother in Licheng heard that she could not participate in the hired and poor peasant group and was also afraid. After studying the Land Law, she was happy to know that a new peasant association would be established. Other middle peasants were also particularly happy to hear this. After the joint discussion of the Land Law by middle and poor peasants in Guozhuang, She County, middle peasant Shu Lan said: "Chairman Mao is afraid that we poor people will not have a good life, and all his good intentions are used on us. If we waste the fruits and don't have a good life, and our bodies are not turned over, we will be sorry for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Since then, the wasteful phenomenon in the village has quickly stopped. Some expressed great regret for the things that had been wasted. After understanding the Land Law, an old middle peasant in Dagang Village said: "I was wrong in the past, and letting my child stop transportation has already earned less money. If I don't hurry up, I can't make up for it." Then he told his child to engage in transportation again.

    黎城等地以贫雇为核心
    向中农宣传土地法
    涉县郭庄浪费现象很快停止
    【太行消息】黎城等地许多区村，以贫雇为核心、联合中农，召开贫中农会或一家人座谈会，深入讨论土地法的精神，对稳定中农、团结全体农民起了很大的作用。土地法刚公布时，有的中农没有了解，地主富农又造谣、破坏，一部分中农特别是富裕中农，产生了恐慌不安及浪费不生产的现象。各地领导上发觉了这些问题，便及时提出：除深入贫雇宣传外，还必须加强对中农的宣传，让中农也普遍的了解土地法，使全体农民一致起来，彻底实现平分。在黎城二、四、六区及涉县、武乡、壶关、平顺某些村子，先后举行了贫中农座谈会及一家人会。首先在贫雇研究土地法时讨论了团结中农，然后在一家人会上向中农解释土地法，发动中农谈心，排除误解，使中农真正了解平分与自己的关系。涉县六区陡贡村贫雇会上，明确的提出：要彻底消灭封建，把平分作好，除贫雇领导干以外，必须团结中农。贫农刘书科说：“咱既要掌权作主，就得细心点，决不说横理，把事办好，地主封建一点也不让他混过去，另外，可不能打到咱们自己人头上。”刘金才补充说：“咱必须记住坚决团结中农。”贫雇讨论以后，便在村内召开中贫农会，向中农讲解了土地法。富裕中农刘书心听了后，大胆的说：“哈！原来是这样呀，我这就不害怕了。开头听说平分，我想这下可轮到咱头上来了，快要消灭我，我没办法啦，准备把俺那个小驴卖了，买些白面肉吃吃，往外走他娘呀。今天黑夜我听了土地法，这可放心了。我那想法不对，我要好好拾砍。”襄垣孙家庄中贫农会上，有些中农存在着怕挨斗争的思想，贫雇便提出：“咱不是斗‘有’，是要斗剥削的。劳动和封建不能混起来。中农也是劳动人，受剥削的，上中农往出拿些多余土地也是商量着办，绝不是斗争，浮财根本不动”。经过讨论，中农的心安下来。黎城六区西村中农刘二孩，听到平分，认为一齐打乱，拿在大街上一筐一篮的平分，便大浪费起来。后经贫雇解释，他很感动的说：“我太糊涂了，多亏你们说的早，要不是我就跌到坑里了”。黎城王生田妈听说自己不能参加雇贫小组，也害了怕。在研究土地法后，知道还要成立新农会，也高兴了。其他中农听了这一点也特别的欢喜。涉县郭庄在中贫农联合讨论土地法后，中农书兰说：“毛主席光怕咱穷人的时光过不好，一盘好心都用在咱身上了。咱要浪费果实，时光过不好，身翻不透，对不住共产党毛主席”。从此很快的停止了村内的浪费现象。有的对已浪费的东西表示很大惋惜。大港村老中农了解了土地法后，说：“过去我错了，让俺孩停下运输已经少赚了不少钱，不再赶赶可补不起来了。”随后便又叫他孩子搞运输去。
