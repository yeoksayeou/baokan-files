Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: A dispatch from Northeast China: The Chiang bandits isolated in Yingkou, southern Liaoning, have reached the end of their rope. The bandits were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army as early as last autumn. Since the harbor froze, even the last maritime supply line has been completely cut off. Now, the Chiang bandit soldiers are forced to dig fortifications on empty stomachs, and desertion is extremely serious. The street trees in front of the railway station and the desks and benches in the schools have all been chopped down for firewood by the Chiang bandits' 9th Independent Division stationed in the city. Under the heavy exploitation of the Chiang bandits, major stores have closed down one after another. The Chiang bandits have looted all the food from the people, causing the poor to rise up and seize rice. A few days ago, the Chiang bandit's grain stored in the city's Red Cross warehouse was all seized. Rice-snatching riots frequently occur on Cross Street, and even the Chiang bandit military police cannot stop them.

    营口景象凄惨  贫民群起抢米
    【新华社陕北一日电】东北讯：孤悬辽南营口蒋匪已临穷途末路。该匪早于去年秋季即被人民解放军包围，自海口封冻后，连唯一的海上补给线也最后断绝了。现蒋匪士兵被迫饿着肚子在挖工事，逃亡现象极为严重。火车站前的街路树及学校的棹凳都被该市蒋匪独九师砍作柴烧。在蒋匪苛榨下，各大商店接踵倒闭。民间食粮被蒋匪掠夺一空，致贫民群起抢米，日前该市红十字会仓库蒋匪存粮全被抢走，十字道街经常发生抢米风潮，蒋匪军警亦无法制止。
