Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Washington dispatch: Truman's submission of the 1948 Aid-Chiang Plan to the U.S. Congress on the 18th, along with Marshall's announcement of the detailed Aid-Chiang program to the U.S. Congress on the 20th, clearly exposes U.S. imperialism's arrogant ambition to invade China. Marshall plainly declared that among the $570 million Aid-Chiang plan, $510 million of material "aid" was to give the Chiang bandits the "dollar ability to purchase military supplies" to continue slaughtering the Chinese people. The plan also stipulated that the Chiang bandits must sell national economic sovereignty, such as the Shanghai Power Company, the Yuehan Railway, the Ganxi and Xiangtan coal mines in Hunan, as well as the Taiwan Sugar Company, fertilizer plants and cement plants and port facilities in Taiwan and South China, allowing U.S. imperialism to invest and control them. This "aid" would amount to $60 million. The plan also blatantly stipulated that U.S. imperialism could plunder China's "strategic materials," and the Chiang bandits must "sell" all such strategic materials to the "United States" within a so-called "certain period." The U.S. imperialism could also obtain great supervisory power over the production and distribution of materials in the Chiang area and the Chiang bandits' finances. The Chiang bandit government should submit a report to the U.S. government at least once every quarter on the "use" of U.S. aid and the "progress of future work." At the same time, the plan stipulated that the Chiang bandits must guarantee to improve "commercial relations" with the U.S., to further facilitate the dumping of U.S. goods in China. To achieve the above-mentioned goals of invading China, U.S. imperialism could send "any personnel employed by the United States" to act as "advisors" to the Chiang bandit government, and send "members of Congress approved by the House or Senate and representatives of American newspapers and radio stations" to China for "inspection." To ensure that the personnel sent to China fully meet the needs of invading China, the plan stipulated that the U.S. intelligence agency, the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," has the right to review whether these personnel are "clean." The plan also instructed the Chiang bandits to continuously carry out propaganda about "U.S. aid" "using all media within China" to cover up the bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism's invasion of China. In addition to the above, the U.S. president can also at any time propose to the Chiang bandits any "other guarantees" related to U.S. imperialist privileges that the "president may deem necessary" to be vigorously implemented.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. According to a report from the U.S. Imperialist United Press in Washington on the 21st: A memorandum from the U.S. State Department to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed that the United States has approved several "contracts" to sell U.S. war surplus materials cheaply to Chiang Kai-shek, including aircraft and ammunition. One of the contracts stipulates that ammunition currently stockpiled in the Marianas will be transferred to the Chiang bandits, who will only pay one percent of the price; another stipulates that materials originally worth millions of dollars will be purchased by the Chiang bandits at 12.5 percent of the original price. American diplomatic figures and the Chiang bandit delegation currently staying in the United States have admitted that the U.S. Army will search for some usable aircraft for the Chiang bandits in various parts of the Pacific. United Press has learned that eighty U.S. fighter planes have been allocated under the U.S. surplus property plan. The U.S. State Department admitted that military supplies to aid Chiang are already on their way to China.

　　美帝一九四八年援蒋方案　完全暴露侵华野心
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】华盛顿讯：社鲁门十八日提交美国会之一九四八年援蒋方案，与马歇尔廿日在美国会宣布之援蒋详细节目，清楚暴露出美帝侵略中国之狂妄野心。马歇尔明白宣露五亿七千万援蒋方案中，五亿一千万美元的物资“援助”是为了给蒋匪以“购买军需品的美元能力”，以继续屠杀中国人民，计划另规定蒋匪须出卖上海电力公司、粤汉铁路、赣西与湖南湘潭煤矿以及台湾制糖公司、台湾与华南的肥料厂、水泥厂、码头设备等国家经济主权，让美帝投资控制，此项“援助”则为六千万美元。方案并露骨规定美帝得掠夺中国“战略物资”，蒋匪须在所谓“一定期限”内将此等战略物资悉数“售予美国”，以及美帝可获得对于蒋区物资之生产、分配及蒋匪财政之极大监督权，蒋匪政府每季至少应向美政府提交美援“使用”及“未来工作之进行”的报告一次。同时方案又规定蒋匪须保证改善对美“商务关系”，更便美货来华倾销。为达上述诸侵华目的，美帝可派遣“任何由美国雇用之人员”充当蒋匪政府“顾问”，及派遣“包括众院或参院批准之国会委员及美国报纸与电台代表”来华“视察”；美帝为使来华人员完全符合于侵华需要，规定美国特务机关“联邦调查局”对此等人员有审查其是否“清白”之权。方案中又指令蒋匪须“利用中国境内之一切媒介”不断进行关于“美援”之宣传，以掩饰美帝侵华的血腥罪行。除以上各项外，美总统且可随时向蒋匪提出其必须厉行之“总统可能认为需要”之有关美侵华特权之任何“其他保证”。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据美帝合众社华盛顿二十一日消息：美国务院在致美众院外交委员会之备忘录中泄露，美国已批准几项“合同”，把美国战争剩余物资廉价售与蒋介石，其中包括飞机和弹药。合同之一规定把目前囤积在马里安纳的弹药转交蒋匪，蒋匪只付百分之一的价钱；另一规定原值数百万美元之物资，由蒋匪以原价百分之十二点五的格价购买。美国外交界人士及现在留在美国的蒋匪代表团皆供认：美国陆军将在太平洋各地再为蒋匪搜罗一些能供使用的飞机。合众社获悉，美国八十架战斗机已根据美剩余财产计划拨出。美国务院承认：援蒋军事物资已在运华途中。
