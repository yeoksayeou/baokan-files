　　Decline of the Textile Industry in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
　　Workers at Three Qingdao Newspapers Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: According to disclosures in newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the textile industry in these areas is declining daily. Currently, there are over 240 textile factories in all Chiang-controlled areas, with approximately 4.7 million spindles. These factories require about 11 million dan of raw cotton annually. However, last year, these factories only obtained about 4 million dan of raw cotton, resulting in a sharp decline in production. The total yarn production of all factories in 1946 was only 1.3 million bales (400 pounds per bale), only half of the pre-war annual production of 2.5 million bales (420 pounds per bale). Equipment and technology lag far behind Japan and the United States, and the products cannot compete with Japanese and American textiles dumped into China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: According to foreign news agencies, workers at all thirteen newspapers in Qingdao City went on strike on the 18th, protesting the factory's unreasonable wage adjustments. As of that day, only one English-language daily newspaper remained; the city was otherwise without newspapers.

　　蒋区纺织工业衰落
  　青岛三家报业工人罢工
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据蒋区报纸披露：蒋管区纺织工业日趋衰落。现全蒋区共有二百四十余家纺织厂，约有纺锭四百七十万枚，每年需用原棉约一千一百余万担，但去年各厂所获原棉，仅约四百万担，致产量锐减。而三十五年各厂纺纱总产量亦仅一百三十万包（每包四百磅），仅及战前年产量二百五十万包（每包四百二十磅）的二分之一。设备及技术则远落日、美之后，出品根本不能与来华倾销之日、美纺织品竞争。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据外国通讯社报导：青岛全市十三家报纸工人，于十八日起全体罢工，抗议厂方不合理的工资调整。当日起除仅有的一家英文日报外，全市无报。
