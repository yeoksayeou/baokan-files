Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Paris dispatch: The French people are rising up to protest the Schuman government's reactionary measures. The French Communist Party issued an important statement on the 5th, calling on the French people to hold a national demonstration on the 8th to oppose the reactionary government's monetary policy. The statement pointed out: "This is a traitorous measure by the government to help American imperialism interfere in French politics and economy." Three thousand workers at the Micheville factory in the Department of Meurthe-et-Moselle went on strike at the end of last month to protest the reactionary government's persecution of trade union officials. Five hundred miners in the area also held a sympathy strike. Municipal employees in Marseille recently also announced a strike to protest the government's decision to prohibit the circulation of 5,000-franc banknotes. More than 6,000 private and taxi drivers in Paris held a conference at the labor exchange on the 4th to protest the reduction in gasoline rations, pointing out that the result would be the risk of unemployment for 15,000 automobile transport workers in Paris. The Mutual Aid Building also held another similar protest meeting of more than 5,000 people.
