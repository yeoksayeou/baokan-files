Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th. Political Commissar Wu of a certain division of the Northeast People's Liberation Army responded to the call from superiors to "military and political leaders and cadres to go deep into the grassroots and implement specific leadership." He went to a certain battalion to personally help with the work and gained the following preliminary experiences in eight days: First, he helped a certain battalion correct the work style of its leaders which was focused on being overly preoccupied with routine matters. In the past, when arranging military studies or other work, the battalion planned today for tomorrow, and notices were issued only in the evening, which put the cadres below in a passive position. They could not prepare and had to cope hastily, failing to achieve the expected results. For example, the Sixth Company's branch committee held as many as 32 meetings in two months, which brought normal work to a standstill. Second, ideological education was strengthened to avoid simple "struggle." When the Fifth Company's First Platoon held a platoon meeting and criticized the old soldier Lü Shuhai for falling behind, the squad leader went to pull him back, which led to a quarrel. At that time, neither the squad leader nor Lü humbly reflected on their actions, which caused the criticism meeting to become deadlocked. The instructor advocated immediately convening a branch general meeting to carry out ideological struggle against Lü. Political Commissar Wu suggested to them: first, conduct individual talks to allow both sides to reflect, and then hold a criticism meeting. As a result, simple "struggle" was avoided, and unity was achieved. In addition, he also convened a squad leader symposium to discuss squad leadership and consolidation work. He personally summarized the squad leadership methods and improved the squad leaders' abilities. When convening a branch committee group leader symposium, he also summarized how the branch committee developed party members, carried out party education, and how to assist in administrative work, which improved the work of the branch. Political Commissar Wu also explained how to take the mass line in leadership work, and how to implement ideological education of loving soldiers, correcting the notion of some company cadres who measured the soldiers' consciousness by whether they supported the cadres. He proposed that cadres should take the initiative to love soldiers to gain the soldiers' support. The main reason for Political Commissar Wu's achievements in going deep into the grassroots is that he had no airs and was very enthusiastic and sincere to both cadres and soldiers. He ate sorghum rice with the soldiers, personally poured tea when soldiers came, and deeply understood the new leadership methods instructions of Commander Lin and Director Tan.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th. A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army has transformed the work style of its headquarters. Under the slogans of "put down airs, become one with the soldiers, help the companies solve specific problems" and "move the office into the company," the direct subordinate departments of the regiment, namely the staff, political, supply, and health departments, have transferred most of their cadres to the companies to work alongside the soldiers and help the companies improve various tasks. It has now been proven that this is a good way to strengthen the work of the military organs. During the recent training campaign, the regiment's staff department left only one staff officer to persist in the work. The three comrades who went down to the company discovered many problems in military education, assault exercises, the removal of ideological concerns of demolition personnel, and the improvement of demolition technology. This greatly strengthened the staff organ's guidance on the military work of the companies. The political department left one cadre in the headquarters to replace the work of several people, which strengthened the efficiency of the headquarters work. The three groups that went down to the company greatly promoted the work of the company. For example, the organization section summarized the shortcomings of a branch's work and two good typical group materials. The propaganda section summarized the problem of unity and mutual assistance in a squad. The liaison section summarized the materials for reviewing and educating liberated soldiers. Comrades from the supply department personally participated in buying vegetables and grinding flour, helped the company improve its food, and cleared up long-standing accounts of several units. The cadres who stayed behind to persist in the work also successfully completed the supply work for the entire regiment. Most of the cadres of the health team went down to the company, and gave great help and promotion to the company's sick bay and environmental hygiene. At the same time, the comrades who stayed behind also completed the medical treatment of convalescing members and the education of nursing staff. In the work, close organic cooperation has truly been achieved between various large and small departments, solving the past phenomenon of formal cooperation but actual separation of each. For example, when the staff officer helped the demolition squad learn military technology in the company, and the demolition personnel had ideological concerns about demolition, the staff officer first came to help the demolition personnel clear their minds and remove their concerns, and did political work. Comrades from the political department also did military work when participating in company military exercises and evaluations. Because there were liberated soldiers and party member soldiers in the squad, military and political studies included the work of the organization, propaganda, and security departments. In addition, they initially found a way for the military organs to closely cooperate with the company, and greatly improved the morale and prestige of the military organs' cadres.

　　东北我军某师吴政委
    深入下层具体领导
  　加强思想教育避免单纯“斗争”
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北解放军某师吴政委响应上级提出：“军政首长干部深入下层，实行具体领导”的号召。他到某营亲自帮助工作，在八天中获得初步经验如下：首先是帮助某营改正了营领导上事务主义的作风。该营从前在布置军事学习或其他工作时，是今天计划明天，今晚才下通知，使下面干部的工作处于被动，无法准备，仓促应付，达不到预期效果。又如该营六连支委会在两月内开会三十二次之多，使正常工作陷入停滞状态。其次，是加强思想教育，避免单纯“斗争”。五连一排开排务会，当检讨到老战士吕树海掉队，班长去拉，即引起了口角，当时班长与吕都不虚心反省，使检讨会成为僵局，指导员主张立即召开支部大会，对吕进行思想斗争，吴政委向他们提出：首先进行个别谈话，让双方反省，然后再开检讨会，结果免避了单纯“斗争”，达到了团结。此外，他还召集了班长座谈会，讨论班的领导与巩固工作，他亲自总结了班的领导方法，提高了班长能力。在召开支委小组长座谈时，又总结了支委发展党员进行党的教育，及如何帮助行政工作等，改进了支部工作。吴政委还讲解领导工作如何走群众路线，及贯彻爱兵的思想教育，纠正了某些连队干部以战士是否拥护干部作为测量战士觉悟的尺度，提出要以干部主动爱兵来取得战士拥护。吴政委深入下层获得这些成绩的主要原因，是自己没有架子，无论对干部战士都很热情诚恳，与战士同吃高粱饭，战士来时，亲自倒茶，深入营连体会了林司令员谭主任新的领导方法指示的结果。
    【新华社华东前线十九日电】解放军某团转变机关作风，在“放下架子，与战士打成一片，帮助连队解决具体问题”，“把办公室搬进连队里去”的口号下，团直司、政、供、卫各部门抽调大部干部下连，与战士们一道，帮助连队改进各种工作。现已证明这是加强部队机关工作的好办法。在近月练兵运动中，该团参谋处只留下一个参谋坚持工作，下连的三位同志，在军事教育、攻坚演习、对爆破员思想顾虑的解除、爆破技术的提高各方面发现了许多问题，大大加强了参谋机关对连队军事工作的指导。政治处留在机关的干部一人顶替数人的工作，加强了机关工作效率，而下连队的三个小组更大大推动了连队工作。如组织股总结了一个支部工作存在的缺点和两个好的典型小组材料。宣教股总结了一个班的团结互助问题。联络股总结了审查教育解放战士的材料。供给处同志亲自参加买菜、磨面，帮助连队改善了伙食，清算了几个单位久悬未清的帐目。留下坚持工作的干部同样顺利完成供应全团的供给工作。卫生队大部干部下连，对连队的病号突击治疗和环境卫生都给了很大的帮助和推动，同时留队同志也完成了休养员的医疗任务与护理员的教育工作。在工作中，各个大小部门间真正做到了密切的有机配合，解决了过去形式上配合而实际上各搞各的分家现象。例如参谋在连队帮助爆破班学习军事技术而爆破员在思想上对爆破有顾虑，参谋就先来帮助爆破员打通思想，解除顾虑，做了政治工作。政治处同志在参加连队军事演习和评判时，也同样做了军事工作。因为班里有解放战士、有党员战士，因此军事学习与政治学习更是包括了组织、宣传、保卫等各部门的工作。此外初步摸到了部队机关工作如何和连队密切配合的门径，也大大提高了机关干部的情绪和威信。
