Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, Moscow, 28th of last month: Readers from all over the Soviet Union have recently written to the editors of Pravda, inquiring whether they agree with the position stated by Dimitrov at a press conference in Sofia, which considered the possibility of forming a "federation" or "confederation" of the Balkan and Danube countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Greece. It also stated the necessity of forming a customs union between these countries. Therefore, the editors of Pravda offer the following explanation on this matter:

	(1) Pravda had to publish Comrade Dimitrov's statement. Foreign newspapers have already published it. Naturally, Pravda cannot make any changes to the original statement.

	(2) However, this does not mean that the editors of Pravda agree with Comrade Dimitrov's attitude towards the establishment of a "federation" or customs union of the aforementioned countries. On the contrary, the editors of Pravda believe that these countries do not need to organize this still-questionable artificial "federation," "confederation," or customs union. What they need today is to mobilize and organize the democratic forces of the masses at home, thereby consolidating and defending the independence of national sovereignty. This has been correctly stated in the declaration of the nine communist parties.

    真理报编者答读者
    不同意季米特洛夫同志对巴尔干和多脑河各国成立联邦的态度
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社莫斯科上月二十八日电：苏联各地读者顷函询真理报编者，是否赞同季米特洛夫在索菲亚记者招待会上所发声明的立场，该声明认为可以把巴尔干和多脑河各国组成“联邦”或“邦联”，连同波兰、捷克与希腊在内。并且还说在这些国家间有成立一个关税同盟的必要。因此，真理报编者特就此事作解释如下：
    （一）真理报对季米特洛夫同志的声明，是必须予以登载的。国外各报都已登载。自然，真理报对于声明原文，不能有任何更改。
    （二）但这并不等于真理报的编者，就同意季米特洛夫同志对上述国家成立“联邦”或关税同盟所持的态度。相反地，真理报编者认为：这些国家并不需要组织这一尚成问题的人为的“联邦”、“邦联”或关税同盟。它们今日所需要的，就是动员和组织国内人民大众的民主力量，从而巩固和保卫国家主权的独立。这在九国共产党宣言上，已经正确昭示了。
