Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd Telegram: TASS, Athens dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army continues to expand its offensive, and another good news has been reported. A unit of the Greek Democratic Army recently occupied Aknowa City in Lukmeria, killing, wounding, and capturing 300 enemies in this battle, and seizing a large number of spoils. Another unit of the Democratic Army captured many enemy strongholds in the Epirus and Lukmeria regions, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The Battle of Kotzana is still continuing. According to a public statement issued by the Western Macedonia Headquarters regarding the battle from December 25th of last year to January 15th of this year: "This battle proves that the Democratic Army's combat skills have matured and its superiority has greatly exceeded the Royalist Fascist bandit army. The Democratic Army achieved significant results: a total of 1,400 enemies were killed, wounded, and captured, and a large number of spoils were seized." Recently, the Democratic Army shot down 16 enemy planes and destroyed 17 enemy planes on various battlefields.

According to Agence France-Presse's dispatch on the 1st: The Athens Fascist puppet government, frightened by the fact that "the activities of the guerrillas have expanded to all of Greece," specially convened a high-level national defense meeting and invited its American and British masters to attend and provide guidance. After the meeting, Sophoulis and Tsaldaris were ordered to announce the reorganization of the Army Department. All troops will be commanded by the Supreme Staff headed by Kitrilakis and two new war zones will be established, in a vain attempt to make a final struggle.

    【新华社陕北二日电】综合塔斯社雅典讯：希腊民主军在继续扩展攻势中，又传捷报。希民主军一部最近已占领陆麦利亚的阿克诺瓦城，此役共毙伤俘敌三百人，并缴获大量战利品。另部民主军攻克爱匹鲁斯与陆麦利亚区敌据点多处，予敌重创。科柴纳之战仍在继续中。据西马其顿总部发表去年十二月二十五日至今年一月十五日该地作战公报称：“在此次战役中，证明民主军作战技术的成熟与优越，已大大超过保皇党法西斯匪军。民主军获重大战果：共毙伤俘敌一千四百人，缴获大批战利品”。最近民主军曾在各战场击落敌机十六架，击毁敌机十七架。
    另据法新社一日讯：雅典法西斯伪政府震慑于“游击队的活动已扩展至希腊全境”，特召开高级国防会议，请其美英主子出席指导。会后，索福利斯与曹达利斯奉命宣布改组陆军部，各部队将由吉特利拉基斯所指挥的最高参谋部所统帅，并建立两个新战区，妄图作最后挣扎。
