　　Tricked by Eating and Drinking
　　Zhang San Repents for Harboring Landlords
　　(Origin: Small-scale handicraft worker, tailor, of poor peasant background. Joined the Party in April 1946, started working in October 1946, currently the Town Head of Chengguan Town, Lin County.)

　　I am from Chengguan Town, Lin County. In June 1945, I became the chairman of the Peasants' Association. At that time, my family was very poor, and I actively led the struggle in order to get millet to eat. The village chief and the director of the people's education political affairs were landlords. They courted me, and we often ate and drank together, not distinguishing between ourselves, forming factions. We had a conflict with Zhao Mitan, a poor peasant village chief, and this group of us knocked down the old cadres, seizing control of the village.

　　During the land reform movement, I shielded six landlord cadres and Party members. They were not struggled against, but instead received a doubled share of the fruits of the revolution. For example, Li Mingchang, the director of people's education, often ate and drank at restaurants without me having to pay, so I felt I had a good relationship with him. His household received 200,000 yuan worth of fruit, and now has assets of a million yuan. Chen Changhui, the director of political affairs, sold cigarette paper. I smoked his cigarettes without paying, so I shielded him as well. The masses demanded that Li Gengshan, the village chief, be struggled against. He produced 1,700 silver dollars, and I convened a branch meeting, saying that Gengshan was good. He was the village chief and had struggled against landlords before, so let's leave him this stock of silver dollars (the village chief had five brothers). The Party members all agreed. During the general meeting, each member of the Peasants' Association received eleven silver dollars. The remaining 500-plus silver dollars were explained to the masses, saying that Gengshan was a very enlightened village chief. We even sent militiamen to deliver the silver dollars to Li Gengshan. However, I felt very disappointed, having made such a fuss, and only receiving eleven silver dollars. Early the next morning, Ji Gengshan secretly sent me one hundred silver dollars, saying it was to "support" me, and my wife accepted it. At the time, I didn't think this was corruption, but that the village chief was "supporting" me. Later, Section Chief Zheng from the county government came to Chengguan to mobilize the masses to squeeze out feudalism. The masses discussed that Li Gengshan should be the target of struggle. That night, the militiamen went to seal his door. I was at a meeting in the district office, and when I heard about it, I was afraid. I was afraid that Li Gengshan would reveal that he had given me one hundred silver dollars, and I also felt that I had a good relationship with him. I immediately returned home and discussed with the chairman and vice-chairman of the Peasants' Association, instructing the cadres to say to the masses, "Li Gengshan should not be confiscated." Then, I asked Section Chief Zheng to ask the masses for their opinions on whether he should be struggled against. That's how Section Chief Zheng was tricked, and Li Gengshan's family was shielded from struggle. Afterwards, I was very proud, thinking that any cadre who came to work in Chengguan could not escape my grasp. At the time, I didn't realize that they were all landlords, using me to rule the masses. Instead, I was misled by their petty favors, treating the enemy as my confidant, and completely losing my class stand.

### 吃吃喝喝上了当　张三反省包庇地主

　　吃吃喝喝上了当
  　张三反省包庇地主
    （成份贫民小手工业者裁缝出身，一九四六年四月入党，四六年十月参加工作，现任林县城关镇长。）
    我是林县城里人，一九四五年六月当了农会主席。当时家里很穷，为了吃小米，就积极起来领导斗争。村长、民教政治主任都是地主，他们拉拢自己，大家经常在一块吃吃喝喝，不分你我，结成宗派和一个贫农村长赵米旦闹矛盾，我们这一伙把老干部打下去，掌握了村中大权。
    在土改运动中，我包庇了六个地主干部党员，他们没有被斗争，反加倍的分了果实。如民教李明昌，因为经常到饭铺吃喝不用我出钱，就觉得和自己感情很好，他一户得了果实廿万元，现在有百十万财产。政治主任陈昌会，卷纸烟卖，我吸烟不给钱，也就包庇了他。村长李庚山，群众要求斗争，他拿出现洋一千七百元，我就召开支部会，说庚山不错，人家是村长，又斗过地主，他这股的现洋给他留下吧（村长弟兄五个），党员都同意。开大会时，每个农会会员分子十一块现洋，剩下五百多元给群众解释了一下，庚山是村长，很开明，就派民兵给李庚山送去了。不过自己也觉得很败兴，弄了一场，只分到十一块现洋，第二天一早，季庚山偷偷给我送来一百块现洋，说是“拥护”我的老婆收下了。当时我还认为这不算贪污，是村长“拥护”我的。后来县政府郑科长到城关发动群众挤封建，群众讨论出李庚山是斗争对象，黑夜里民兵就去封门，我正在区公所开会，一听说心里就怕，怕斗的李庚山说出给自己一百块现洋，又觉得在一块感情不错，马上回到家里和正副农会主席商量，布置干部在群众中活动说：“李庚山不该没收”，然后又叫郑科长问问群众意见如何，是不是该斗争，就这样郑科长上了当，李庚山家也包庇了，没有斗争。事后还很得意，心想：任何干部到城关工作也都脱不了我的手，当时没有认识到他们都是地主，利用自己统治群众，反被人家小恩小惠迷哄住了，把敌人当成了知己，完全丧失阶级立场。
