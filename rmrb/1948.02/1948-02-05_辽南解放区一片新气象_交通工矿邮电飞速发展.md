Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 3rd: The construction, restoration, and development of transportation, postal and telecommunications, industry, and mining in the Liaonan area have been rapid. In the areas recovered after last year's summer offensive, the democratic government and the masses of the people have overcome many difficulties such as a lack of materials, and significant achievements have been made in various construction works. In terms of transportation: 125 kilometers of the Changchun Railway from Pulandian and Lanping sections, from Wulitai in the south to Lujiatun in the north, were repaired and opened to traffic in July last year, handling passenger and freight transportation, and 16 major railway projects were built successively. All five highways with a total length of 900 kilometers have also been repaired and opened to traffic. In terms of postal and telecommunications: 397 kilometers of high-voltage power transmission lines have been restored. To meet the demands of the vast number of emancipated peasants, more than 150 kilometers of new power transmission lines have been built. In the past six months, the number of electricity users has increased to 16,800 households, power users to 276 households, and electric heating users to 86 households. Recently, the entire electrical lighting equipment of Zhuanghe urban area has been completed, and employees are erecting the Cheng(zi) Zhuang(he) circuit in the frozen and snowy weather. Electric lights have been installed in the rural areas near Wafangdian (i.e., Fuxian). The trunk telephone lines have increased by another 775 kilometers. In addition to the city's local telephone services, long-distance telephone calls to places such as Dashiqiao, Xiuyan in the north, and Ziwo in the south are also unobstructed. Postal services were universally restored in November last year, and post offices or agencies were established in all towns and cities. In terms of industry and mining: In textiles, 23,000 spindles, more than 250 looms, and 12 carpet machines have been restored. More than half of the machines have been re-equipped and repaired. The highest daily output can reach 25 pieces of yarn and 500 bolts of cloth. In the past six months, more than 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn and more than 41,000 bolts of cloth have been produced. In the machinery industry, more than half of the machines for manufacturing ball bearings have been restored, and 80,000 various ball bearings have been produced in the past six months. The sand casting and repair departments have been expanded, ensuring the allocation and repair of machine parts for 40 factories, and more than 50,000 parts have been produced in the past six months. Preliminary research has also been conducted on the manufacture of small machines, and machines such as sawing machines have been created. In addition, according to the needs of the military and civilians, the chemical, paper, ceramic, leather, and oil extraction industries have also developed. The restored and rebuilt coal mines have produced 20,500 tons of coal and more than 100 tons of fuel coal in the past six months. Recently, it is planned to open ten new shafts. In addition, agricultural construction in Liaonan has also made achievements. The agricultural and forestry experimental farm of the administrative office of the district is studying the cultivation of paddy and dry fields and variety experiments of fruit trees and vegetables. Liaonan is rich in apples, with about 1.5 million apple trees. Therefore, a fruit tree research conference was recently held to exchange experiences in fruit tree separation, pest control, fruit pruning, and fertilization. It is also planned to manufacture a large number of insecticidal chemicals for application this year.
