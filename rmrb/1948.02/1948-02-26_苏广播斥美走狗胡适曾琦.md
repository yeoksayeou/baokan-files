Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: Moscow Radio on the 17th broadcasted Kibanov's commentary, severely condemning American imperialist lackeys Hu Shih and Zeng Qi for defending the American imperialist policy of world expansion and slandering the Soviet Union, the great friend of the Chinese people, and other shameless acts. The original text roughly states: Chinese social figures oppose the United States' support for Japanese fascism and expose that the American imperialists have violated their previous obligations and changed their attitude towards the Japanese and German peace treaties, turning these countries into bases for anti-Soviet activities. This righteous call is not to the liking of the American imperialists, so they mobilized their lackeys, such as Hu Shih, to defend the American policy towards Japan. Hu Shih attempted to shift the responsibility for creating international tensions onto the Soviet Union and tried to prove that the entire American policy has not exceeded the scope of the Potsdam Declaration, and shamelessly equated the Soviet Union, the great friend of the Chinese people, with fascist Germany and Japan. In order to curry favor with his master, the United States, Zeng Qi, the leader of the so-called China Youth Party, also hurriedly came forward to defend the United States. However, the Chinese people are not as easily deceived as Hu Shih and Zeng Qi imagined. They know very well that the Soviet Union has put forward many concrete proposals in order to quickly sign peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and it is the so-called Western democratic countries, headed by the United States, that have consistently opposed these proposals and disregarded the Potsdam Conference's resolutions on demilitarizing and democratizing Germany. The Soviet Union has consistently advocated close international cooperation in strengthening democratic peace and safeguarding the security of all countries; while the United States has abandoned the principle of international cooperation and concerted action among the major powers, and has adopted a policy of openly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, assisting the reactionary forces in these countries against their own democratic forces.
    Chinese social figures are also very clear that since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has consistently supported the freedom and independence of the Chinese people and has consistently opposed imperialist attempts to enslave the great Chinese nation. The Soviet Union was the main force in crushing Hitler's Germany and made a decisive contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism, thus helping the Chinese people maintain their independence. After the war, American imperialism attempted to turn China into its own colony, and the Soviet Union became a powerful obstacle to the implementation of this plan. The Chinese people know that maintaining close friendship with their great neighbor, the Soviet Union, is a guarantee of maintaining their independence and the integrity of Chinese territory. It is precisely for this reason that the lackeys of American imperialism are roaring so loudly in an attempt to slander the great friend of the Chinese people, the Soviet Union. Chinese social figures know that Hu Shih has been serving the American imperialists for a long time. Throughout the entire war, he lived in the United States, completely detached from the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. It is more accurate to say that he is an American than a Chinese, and he has completely lost his prestige in Chinese cultural circles. After Japan surrendered, he served as the president of Peking University and established close ties with the American military officers of the Executive Headquarters. He not only did not express any protest against the American soldiers' slaughter of Chinese coolies and the rape of his female students at Peking University, but also tried his best to suppress the righteous indignation of the Chinese people aroused by the atrocities of the American soldiers raping female students at Peking University. Zeng Qi is a notorious Chinese traitor. He was a worshipper of fascism long ago. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served Japan and later switched to Chiang Kai-shek to serve the United States. The shameless rumors of Hu Shih and Zeng Qi, the lackeys of American imperialism, slandering the Soviet Union are bound to go bankrupt, because the Chinese people have long known that the Soviet Union is their loyal and sincere friend.

　　苏广播斥美走狗胡适曾琦
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科电台十七日广播基盘诺夫评论，痛斥美帝走狗胡适、曾琦之流为美帝世界扩张政策辩护，并诽谤中国人民伟大友人苏联等无耻行为。原文略称：中国社会人士反对美国扶植日本法西斯，并揭露美帝已违背自己以前担负的义务，改变自己对日、德和约的态度，正在把这些国家变成为反苏的根据地。这种正义呼声是不适合于美帝胃口的，因此他便动员他的走狗如胡适之流，为美国对日政策辩护。胡适企图将造成国际紧张局势的责任推到苏联身上，又企图证明美国的全部政策没有超过波茨顿宣言的范围，并且卑鄙无耻的把中国人民的伟大友人苏联与法西斯德、日并列，为了向自己的主子美国献媚，所谓中国青年党领袖曾琦也慌忙起来替美国辩护。可是中国人民并不如胡适和曾琦所想象那样容易受欺骗，他们很清楚苏联为了要迅速与德、奥签订和约曾提出许多具体建议，而经常反对这些建议，蔑视波茨顿会议关于使德国非军国主义化和使其民主化的决议的，正是以美国为首的所谓西方民主国家。苏联经常主张在加强民主和平与保障各国安全事业上实行密切的国际合作；而美国则放弃了国际合作与各大列强一致行动的原则，采取公开的干涉其他国家内政的政策，援助这些国家的反动势力对抗本国的民主力量。
    中国社会人士并且很清楚的知道，自从十月革命以来，苏联一贯拥护中国人民的自由与独立，经常反对帝国主义想奴役伟大中国民族的企图。苏联是粉碎希特勒德国的主要力量，并且对击败日本帝国主义做了有决定意义贡献，因此帮助了中国人民保持着自己的独立。战后美帝国主义企图把中国变成自己的殖民地，苏联成了他们实行这种计划的强大障碍。中国人民知道与自己的伟大邻邦--苏联保持密切的友好，是保持自己独立和中国领土完整的保证，正是由于这个原因，美帝国主义的走狗们，才如此咆哮的企图诽谤中国人民的伟大友人苏联。中国社会人士知道胡适很早就替美帝效劳，在整个战时他都住在美国，完全脱离了中国人民的抗日战争，与其说他是中国人，倒不如说他是美国人，他在中国文化界早已完全丧失了威信。他在日本投降后充当北大校长，与执行部的美国军官建立密切的联系，对美国兵在北平屠杀中国苦力、和强奸他的女学生，不但没有表示任何抗议，反而竭力压制因美军强奸北大女生兽行而激起中国人民的义愤。曾琦是中国臭名昭著的汉奸，他老早就是法西斯的崇拜者。在抗战期间他替日本效劳，后来又转到蒋介石那里替美国服务。美帝国主义走狗胡适、曾琦诽谤苏联的无耻造谣一定遭到破产，因为中国人民老早就知道苏联是他们忠实诚挚的友人。
