Zuoquan First District Holds Meeting of Poor Peasants, Hired Laborers, and Cadres
Carefully Studies Land Law
Understands it Themselves, Then Publicizes it to the Masses

[Zuoquan News] The First District of Zuoquan County convened a meeting of cadres of poor peasants and hired laborers, and more enlightened poor and hired peasants on the 17th of this month. A total of 103 district and village cadres and 81 peasants participated. The purpose of this meeting was to study the Land Law and review the publicity of the Land Law. According to reports from various villages, when the Land Law was conveyed on the 2nd of this month, due to the short time, only several spirits and the discipline of observing the Land Law were pointed out, as well as the system of collecting mass reflections and reporting. Due to the different ideological understandings of the village cadres, the acceptance was also different, so several different situations arose: More honest cadres, after returning to the village, read and explained it to the masses one by one, convened mass meetings and meetings of various strata, and conducted research and discussion, such as in Liujiazhuang and Xiafenghou villages. The cadres patiently and repeatedly interpreted it to the masses, not only did no problems occur, but also promoted production. Some villages only read it to the masses once and did not explain it further, such as Songjiazhuang and Caojiazai villages, which caused misunderstandings among the masses, who were only afraid of disrupting the equitable distribution. A few village cadres were not honest in publicizing to the masses, but had other purposes, only discussing who to draw from and who not to draw from, disrupting the equal distribution. Even a "Equal Distribution Committee" was established. This caused unrest among the masses, who secretly sold grain and indulged in excessive eating and drinking at night, and landlords also took the opportunity to carry out sabotage. According to reports from various places, peasants who had not completely turned themselves over actively supported and endorsed it, saying that this might mean cultivating a good piece of land. A few middle peasants and cadres and activists who had taken too much fruit produced ideas of fear and waiting, such as cadres who had taken too much fruit said: We have taken too much, we will return it, just wait to return it. Some middle peasants asked the cadres when will we struggle? When will we divide the land, and then it will be over.

When the meeting reached this point, it turned to examining why these phenomena occurred. The political director of Yinjiazhuang said: When I was publicizing the Land Law Outline, I didn't understand why the landlord should get the same share, so I didn't read that clause. The village chief of Fuyu said: I didn't come to the meeting on the 2nd, and the political director came back and told me to divide the land, and I thought: Usually we say to produce and get rich, but we haven't even raised three cows, and now we are going to divide the land, and you still say to publicize it well, I just didn't understand it.

Everyone looked back and examined themselves, corrected their attitude, and the meeting turned to studying and discussing the Land Law Outline, clause by clause and word by word. Regarding the issue of giving the landlord the same share, some said in the discussion: Giving the landlord the same share should not be written in the Land Law Outline. Regarding the issue of middle peasants, some said: If the landlords are all struggled against, and we want to level out the wealth, where will we make up the difference if not from the middle peasants? The higher authorities said that the middle peasants should not be touched, and that we must see the situation. Everyone argued very heatedly. The leaders then read the administrative office's announcement and the Xinhua Daily editorial on overcoming distortions and misunderstandings, and then divided into groups for research and discussion. At the beginning of the discussion, some people still said that the landlords should be given bad land, and that the middle peasants should not be touched, depending on the situation. Some people had different opinions. The village chief of Houyaoyu said: In the past, I thought it was unreasonable to give the landlord a share, but today, according to the Outline, in order to completely eliminate feudalism, we give the landlord a share, which means we must completely eliminate them economically and make them bow their heads politically. This is the peasants' leniency towards the landlords. Guo Yinxiang of Xiafenghou said: Chairman Mao said to unite 90% of the peasants, if we struggle against the middle peasants, who will dare to rise up? We are eliminating feudalism, not eliminating middle peasants. Through repeated discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that giving the landlord the same share must be conditional on him lowering his head politically and surrendering his weapons economically. The key to not touching the middle peasants is that we are eliminating feudalism, not eliminating wealth. At the same time, the floating wealth of wealthy middle peasants should not be touched, and only land should be drawn through consultation to achieve equitable distribution of land. Everyone also recalled that in the previous period, landlords took advantage of loopholes, and some peasants were wasteful, which was all detrimental to us. This time, when we go back, we should honestly publicize to the peasants, and our cadres should resolutely withdraw the excess fruit they have taken.

Everyone set out a publicity plan. Some people suggested: When we go back, we should focus on the poor and hired laborers in publicizing the Land Law Outline, and unite the middle peasants. In terms of method, we should take a persuasive attitude towards the middle peasants, explaining that wasting is our own blood and sweat, and that we peasants are one family. For those who have taken too much fruit, we should explain that they should honestly return the excess fruit and concentrate on production. To the landlords and saboteurs, we should give strict warnings, telling them to lower their heads and not sabotage, otherwise they will be subject to public trial by the people. Everyone said: We must patiently and repeatedly explain to the peasants, so that every peasant understands and turns to production. We should use the publicity of the Land Law Outline to inspect production, and use production achievements to measure the publicity of the Land Law Outline.

    左权一区开贫雇干部农民会
    细心研究土地法
    自己弄通了，再向群众宣传
    【左权消息】左权一区在本月十七号召开雇贫干部与觉悟较高的雇贫农民会议，参加区村干部共一百零三人，农民八十一人。这个会的目的是学习土地法，检讨宣传土地法的情形。根据各村汇报看来，本月二日传达土地法时，因时间短，只是指出了几种精神与遵守土地法的纪律，和收集群众反映与汇报制度，由于村干部的思想认识不同，接受上也不同，所以产生几种不同的情况：比较老实的干部，回村后一一的向群众宣读与解释，召开了群众大会与各阶层会议，进行研究讨论，如刘家庄、下丰堠等村，干部耐心反复的向群众解读，不但未发生问题，而且推进了生产。有些村只向群众宣读一次，再不解释，如宋家庄、曹家寨等村，引起了群众误解，光怕打乱平分。有个别村干部不老实向群众宣传，反另有目的，光讨论抽谁不抽谁，打乱均分。甚至成立了平分委员会。引起了群众不安，偷着卖粮食，黑夜偷着大吃大喝，地主也来乘机钻空子进行破坏。根据各地反映，未翻透身的农民积极赞成拥护，说这可能种一块好地了。少数中农与多占果实的干部、积极分子产生了怕和等的思想，如多占果实的干部说：咱多占啦，退就退吧，等着退。有些中农问干部啥时斗呀？啥时平分了，就过去了。
    会议开到这里，转入检查为什么发生了这些现象，殷家庄政治主任说：我在宣传土地法大纲时，给地主同样分一份我思想不通，就没念那一条。扶峪村长说：我二号没来开会，政治主任回来和我说平分呀，我想：平常说叫生产发财呀，还没有闹下三个牛，就来平分，还说叫好好宣传，我就没有闹通。
    每个人都回头检查了自己，端正了态度，会议转向了对土地法大纲逐条逐字的研究讨论。给地主同样分一份的问题，在讨论中有的说：给地主同样分一份，不应写在土地法大纲上。对中农问题，有的说：地主斗光了，抽肥补瘦，不向中农抽去哪里补？上级说中农不动，还有个看情况。大家争论很热烈。领导上这时宣读了行署的布告，和新华日报克服曲解与误解的社论，又分小组研究讨论。在开始讨论中，还有人说给地主分是分坏田，对中农不动看情况走。有人意见不一样，后窑峪村长说：过去我认为给地主分说不通，今天根据大纲，在彻底消灭封建的情况下，才给地主分一份，也就是在经济上必须彻底消灭，政治上必须低头，这是农民对地主的宽大。下丰堠郭银祥说：毛主席说团结百分之九十农民，咱要斗了中农，谁还敢往起闹？咱是消灭封建，不是消灭中农。这样反复讨论中，大家一致认为对地主同样分一份，一定要他在政治上低了头，经济上缴了械。中农不动，主要是咱消灭封建，不是消灭财富。同时富裕中农浮财不动，只是土地用协商方法抽些，也是为了达到土地平分。大家又回忆到前一段地主钻空子，有些农民浪费，这都对咱们不利，这次回去，应老老实实向农民宣传，咱干部多占果实，应坚决的退出。
    大家都订出了宣传计划，有人提出：回去在方向上以贫雇为主宣传土地法大纲，并团结中农。在方式上，对中农以劝告态度，说明浪费了是自己的血汗，我们农民是一家。对多占果实的人，说明多占果实应老实的退出来，安心的搞生产。对地主破坏分子，严格的警告，叫他们低头，不能破坏，否则要受人民的公审。大家都表示：要耐心反复的向农民解释，使的每个农民都了解了，走向生产。以宣传土地法大纲来检查生产，以生产成绩来测量土地法大纲的宣传。
