Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Hubei-Anhui Front, 15th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, based on the movement of pouring out grievances and seeking revenge, has been studying Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and has now achieved significant results. They used comparative methods, through each person's own experience, allowing more than 80 percent of the liberated soldiers to deeply understand Chairman Mao's strategic policies and the main strategic significance of our army's leap to the north bank of the Yangtze River, and ridiculed Chiang Kai-shek's current defensive "key offensive" strategy being carried out in the Dabie Mountains. Fu Yonghua, a machine gunner who was liberated in the Dayanghu battle, said at the meeting, "I came early and saw the People's Liberation Army becoming stronger day by day." He recounted the Dayanghu battle, the Henan-North campaign, the Longhai campaign, the annihilation of nine and a half enemy brigades in southwestern Shandong after crossing the river, and the victorious arrival at the Dabie Mountains after a 1,000-mile southern expedition. Finally, he said: "Chiang Kai-shek is afraid of us crossing the Yangtze River and reluctantly brought thirty-four brigades to 'chase' us. What's the use of that? Just wait for Commander Liu to issue an order, and the Yangtze will be crossed! Would he even dare pull out a single hair from our heads?!" Liu You, a combatant liberated in Shao'erzhai, Puyang, said: "Chairman Mao told us to fight battles that are prepared and have certainty of victory, this method is extremely brilliant. Chiang Kai-shek cannot do this, so they are beaten everywhere." Zhang Xijun, who was liberated in the Yangshanjie battle, believes that the Dabie Mountains are the most important, and can be used to attack Nanjing, attack Wuhan, cross the Yangtze River, and join forces with the Chen Su and Chen Xie armies. He said: "Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is useless. There are also many poor people in the Dabie Mountains, which poor person doesn't want to turn over and divide the land? Who doesn't oppose dictatorship and national betrayal? That's why I decided to join the Liberation Army." Many veteran soldiers whose families are in the North China liberated areas all found Chiang Kai-shek's current method of building bunkers and roads around the Dabie Mountains very ridiculous. The experience of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan tells them that this is again the set of tricks of Okamura Neji, the Japanese war criminal who is now Chiang Kai-shek's guest of honor in Nanjing. They all said: Even Japan couldn't starve the Eighth Route Army to death back then, and instead brought about its own defeat, let alone Chiang Kai-shek today.

    鄂豫皖某部学习毛主席报告
    体会毛主席战略方针
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十五日电】解放军某部在诉苦复仇运动的基础上学习毛主席的“目前形势和我们的任务”，现已获得显著的成绩。他们用对比方法，通过各人自己的经历和体验，使百分之八十以上的解放战士深刻的了解了毛主席的战略方针，和我军跃进长江北岸的主要战略意义，并嘲笑了蒋匪目前在大别山进行的防御性的“重点进攻”战略。在大杨湖战斗中被解放过来的机枪手傅永华在会上发言，他说：“我来的早，看到解放军一天比一天强大”。他叙述了大杨湖战斗、豫北战役、陇海战役，渡河后在鲁西南歼灭敌九个半旅，以至南征一千多里胜利到达大别山，最后他说：“蒋介石怕咱们过长江，勉强弄来三十四个旅来‘追’咱们，这有啥用，只待刘司令员下一道命令，长江说过就过，难道他还会扯掉我们一根毛不成？！”在濮阳邵耳寨被解放的战斗员刘友说：“毛主席告诉我们要打有准备有把握的仗，这办法顶高明。蒋介石做不到这一点，所以他们到处挨打”。在羊山集战斗中被解放的张希俊认为大别山最重要，可以打南京，打武汉，过长江，而且与陈粟、陈谢大军联在一块。他说：“蒋介石的进攻没有啥用。大别山也是穷人多呀，哪个穷人不想翻身分田呢？哪个不反对独裁卖国呢？我就是为了这才决心干解放军的。”很多家在华北解放区的老战士们，对蒋介石目前在大别山周围修筑碉堡公路的办法都觉得非常可笑。八年抗日战争中的经验告诉他们，这又是日寇战犯现在南京做蒋介石上宾的冈村宁次的那一套。他们都说：当年日本尚且困不死八路军，反而招到自身的败灭，今天的蒋介石就更不在话下了。
