    Taiyue News: Jiexiu repelled Yan bandit grain robbery twice. A part of the 217th Regiment of the Yan bandits, together with more than 400 people from the puppet security Second and Fifth Squadrons, launched a three-pronged attack on Geduo in our Third District at 8:00 AM on the 3rd of last month to rob grain. One group had just entered the Wang Yue Temple in Aozi Ridge when they stepped on a mine, immediately injuring three people. The next day, the 217th Regiment sent out another battalion, together with the puppet security 18th Regiment's Second and Fifth Squadrons, a total of more than 300 people, to Geduo again to rob grain and seize recruits. On their return, they were ambushed by the Longfeng militia of our rotation team in Yuzi Village. The Yan bandits were beaten so badly that they fled hastily to Jiaojia Cliff bottom. Seven Yan bandits were killed and six were wounded on the spot.

    介休三区民兵打退抢粮阎匪
    【太岳消息】介休两次打退抢粮阎匪。阎匪二一七团一部，上月三日八时，配合伪保安第二、第五中队等四百多人，分三路向我三区圪垛抢粮，一股刚进入鳌子岭王岳庙内，就踏响了一颗雷，当下炸伤三人。第二天，二一七团又派出一个营，配合伪保安十八团第二、第五两个中队共三百多人，再到圪垛抢粮抓丁，返回时，在峪子村遭我轮战队掏心组龙凤民兵埋伏，打得阎匪急向焦家崖底逃窜，当场打死阎匪七名，打伤六名。
