Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Berlin dispatch: Anti-hunger fury is sweeping through West Germany. As of the 3rd, the number of strikers in the British and American joint occupation zones has reached three million. The strike area stretches from the Dutch border all the way to the Swiss border. Striking workers also "held the largest mass demonstration" (Associated Press) to protest the worsening food rations. Thousands of small shops in Württemberg-Baden and many shops in other provinces also held "sympathy market closures" starting on the 3rd and 4th. And other larger-scale and more persistent large-scale strikes are brewing. The strike has brought most industries and institutions in the joint occupation zone to a complete standstill, paralyzing traffic in many major cities such as Hamburg, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, and Hanover. The American-occupied zone of Württemberg-Baden has been particularly hard hit by the strike. One million organized workers in the state participated in the strike. All trams in the province have stopped running, and factories, newspapers, dairies, cafes, and other shops have been closed.
