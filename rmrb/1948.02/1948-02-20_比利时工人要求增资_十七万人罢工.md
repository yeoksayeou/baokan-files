    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Brussels dispatch: 175,000 Belgian workers recently held a large-scale strike to demand wage increases and cost-of-living allowances. The coal pits in Liège, the national industrial center, have been completely shut down due to the miners' strike. As a result of the total strike of gas and power industry workers, Belgium's coal, electricity, and gas production has sharply decreased, and many factories have been forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel, paralyzing the entire transportation system. The Belgian government is extremely panicked and has even ordered the mobilization of all military and police to prepare for a forceful suppression.

    比利时工人要求增资
    十七万人罢工
    【新华社陕北十八日电】布鲁塞尔讯：比利时十七万五千工人于日前举行大罢工，要求增资与生活津贴。全国工业中心列日的煤坑，已因矿工罢工而全部停顿。由于煤气与动力工业工人全部罢工的结果，已使比国的煤、电力与煤气的产量锐减，许多工厂都因缺乏燃料陷于停顿，整个交通也陷于瘫痪状态。比政府十分着慌，竟下令出动所有军警准备武力镇压。
