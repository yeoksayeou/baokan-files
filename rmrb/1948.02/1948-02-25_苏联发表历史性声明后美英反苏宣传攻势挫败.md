Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: Reports from various sources state that the Soviet Information Bureau's recent series of statements, "Falsifiers of History" (excerpts of which will be published by this agency continuously), has won resonance and enthusiastic support from democratic public opinion worldwide, with unanimous agreement that this document makes a significant contribution to combating the enemies of peace. The Czech and Polish peoples, having personally experienced the tragedy of being sold out and subjugated, find their memories particularly painful. The Czech newspaper *Pravo Lidu* stated: "This document ruthlessly exposes the behind-the-scenes political trickery of international imperialists, of which Czechoslovakia was the first victim. Now, the Sudetenland fascists, who have been expelled from Czech territory and are employed by the British, American, and French occupation authorities, are again shouting 'March on Czechoslovakia!'" Polish Foreign Ministry Press Director Groz, in a press conference answering questions from American reporters, solemnly stated that the Polish government fully agrees with the Soviet government's assertion that Western countries incited Germany to launch a war against the Soviet Union; and emphatically stated: "The story of the Munich conspiracy is already well known to all." The Romanian newspaper *Liberation* stated that this document "not only proves the truth of history but also disarms the warmongers of their poisonous weapons." *Timpul* pointed out: "Peace-loving countries have learned a lesson from the tragic lessons of history, and they will unite more closely under the threat of imperialism, and no one will be deceived again." The French Communist Party Political Bureau also expressed satisfaction with this statement on the 20th, believing that the Soviet statement "has given important support to the forces of peace." The French newspaper *L'Humanité* wrote: "Not only Hitler, but also those who gave birth to him, nurtured him, and encouraged him, such as the American warmonger Dulles, must be held responsible for the Second World War." In the United States, the *Daily Worker* pointed out: "The fact that Western countries refused the Soviet request to jointly publish Nazi documents tells us that Western countries are trying to poison the atmosphere that the Soviet Union is currently striving to clarify." The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association also issued a lengthy statement condemning the State Department's anti-Soviet document as "greatly damaging the people's hopes for peace." The liberal afternoon newspaper and the *Chicago Sun* also criticized the State Department for "distorting and falsifying history."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: Comprehensive report: The U.S. State Department, with the unanimous consent of the British and French governments, published the so-called "Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939-1941" on January 21st, attempting to slander the Soviet Union and launch an anti-Soviet propaganda offensive. However, since the Soviet Information Bureau has issued a series of "Falsifiers of History" statements in recent days, according to TASS, it has caused the US and British officials to "fall into obvious confusion"; causing this anti-Soviet propaganda offensive to suffer a setback. After the Soviet statement was published, a British Foreign Office spokesperson immediately denied at a press conference that the British government had agreed to the so-called "German-Soviet documents" published by the U.S. State Department. But when others reminded him that Bevin had already acknowledged in his response to Churchill's speech in Parliament on the 4th of this month that the United States had obtained British consent, the spokesperson was embarrassed and had to apologize to everyone. The clamoring American reactionary public opinion, also had to beat a retreat due to its untenable arguments, and fabricated something like "both sides are responsible," "no need to blame each other" (USIS, February 16th), using this to hastily end the matter.

　　苏联发表历史性声明后美英反苏宣传攻势挫败
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方讯：苏联情报局连日发表的“历史伪造者”的声明（本社即将连续摘发）博得全世界民主舆论的共鸣和热烈支持，一致认为这一文件对打击和平敌人，有着重大贡献。捷、波两国因身受被卖沦亡之惨，回忆尤为沉痛。捷克布拉窝·里都报称：“这一文件无情地揭露了国际帝国主义者的幕后政治把戏，而捷克就是这种把戏的第一个牺牲者。现在，已被驱逐出捷境而为英、美、法占领军当局雇用的苏台德法西斯分子，又在高喊‘向捷克进军’了。”波兰外交部新闻处长格罗兹，日前在记者招待会上答复美国记者询问时，严正表示，波兰政府完全同意苏联政府所称西方国家曾煽动德国发动反苏战争；并力称：“慕尼黑阴谋的故事已属尽人皆知之事”。罗马尼亚解放报说：这一文件“不但证明了历史的真理，而且解除了战争贩子的有毒武器”。丁布尔报指出：“爱好和平的国家从历史的悲惨教训中，学到了一课，他们在帝国主义威胁下，将团结得更紧些，而没有一个人将再受其欺骗”。法共政治局于二十日也对此一声明表示满意，认为苏联的声明“已给予和平力量以重要支持”。法国的人道报写道：“不仅希特勒，而且那些生育他抚养他和鼓励他的人，如美国战争贩子杜勒斯等，都要对第二次世界大战负责。”在美国，工人日报指出：“西方国家拒绝苏联要求共同发表纳粹文件的建议一事，告诉我们西方国家力图毒化苏联目前所力求澄清的气氛。美苏友好协会全国委员会亦发出长篇声明，谴责国务院发表的反苏文件“大大损伤人民要求和平的希望”。自由主义的下午报和芝加哥太阳报，也抨击国务院“曲解和伪造历史”。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】综合报导：美国务院取得英法两国政府的一致同意，于一月二十一日公布了所谓“一九三九——四一年纳粹苏联关系录”，妄图借此诽谤苏联，并发动反苏的宣传攻势。但自苏联情报局连日发表“历史伪造者”的声明后，据塔斯社称：已使美、英等官方“陷于极明显的混乱”；使这次反苏的宣传攻势遭受挫败。英外交部发言人在苏联声明发表后，立即在记者招待会上否认美国务院发表的所谓“德苏文件”曾获得英政府之同意。但当别人提醒说：贝文在本月四日于议会答复邱吉尔的发言中，已承认美国曾征得英国同意时，该发言人狼狈不堪，不得不向大家道歉。大叫大嚷的美国反动舆论，亦因理屈词穷而不得不打一道退堂鼓，胡诌什么“双方都要负责”、“不需彼此互相指摘”，（美新闻处十六日讯）借此草草了事。
