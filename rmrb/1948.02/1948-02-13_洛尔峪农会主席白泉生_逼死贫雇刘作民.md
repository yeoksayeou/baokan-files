    Luoeryu Village in the Seventh District of Xingtai, the chairman of the Farmers' Association and also manager of the cooperative, Bai Quansheng, was a rich peasant before the War of Resistance, later becoming impoverished. In the past, he was the chairman of the Farmers' Association, he collapsed twice, this is the third time he has taken office, and he also serves as the manager of the cooperative. He and the village head and the director of the Armed Forces Committee are in cahoots, and he has a prostitute called Liu Guizhi. When the masses saw him, they could not call him by his name, they always had to call him "Chairman Bai." Calling Liu Guizhi was "Councillor Liu" (she is a county councillor). Bai Quansheng and Liu Guizhi are openly sleeping together (Liu's husband's family is from Yingtou, she divorced two years ago and has not left, often living in Luoeryu), and she was also given a good house. This winter, even the families of revolutionary martyrs did not have firewood, but Bai Quansheng forced the masses to chop a rooftop full of good firewood for Liu Guizhi. When Bai Quansheng confiscated the property of traitors in the past few years, he embezzled twenty bolts of cloth, all of which he gave to Liu Guizhi.

    During the mass movement last year, the masses were afraid of him and wanted to allocate a house to "Chairman Bai." He said verbally: "I am a cadre, let the masses be allocated first." In fact, he took all the stones and wood from the fruits [of struggle], and also took seven or eight bags of grain, saying it was for building a house. This spring he wanted to build a house, and forced the masses to give him "le kuan" (meaning donations) of 400,000 yuan, and also extracted 100,000 yuan from the cooperative. In total, he built one and a half courtyards (28 rooms) without using anything of his own. The workers who built the house were "sent" by the masses, he only made some meals with the fruits of the masses. Now the house he lives in, including the old ones in the past, totals three courtyards and two buildings. During the "le kuan," Bai Quansheng insisted that Liu Zuocheng, a poor hired laborer who had been herding sheep for half his life and only returned from another village last year, had to provide "le kuan," Liu Zuocheng had no money, so Bai Quansheng sealed up his house and did not let him go home for three months. Bai Quansheng took whatever stones he needed to build his house from Liu Zuocheng's yard (Liu Zuocheng was allocated a dilapidated yard, except for one good house, all the other houses had collapsed). He also took down Liu Zuocheng's gate and installed it on Liu Guizhi's gate.

    There was a poor hired laborer named Liu Zuomin, who cut his hand in the autumn and could not work in the fields, so he walked around the streets. This winter, he joined the poor hired laborer group. Bai Quansheng threatened him, saying: "You don't produce, and you still participate in the poor hired laborer group, are you planning to struggle against cadres?" Liu Zuomin was a production team leader, but he was not called to meetings. At this time, bad people took the opportunity to threaten Liu Zuomin, saying: "People want to struggle against you, this time they won't even call you to meetings." Liu Zuomin was very afraid from then on. Another time, the village held a women's meeting, after the meeting everyone else left, but Liu Zuomin's daughter-in-law was left behind, Bai Quansheng said to her: "Your family has been liberated, your father-in-law and mother-in-law don't do anything now, and your brother is still in the Central Army, if you don't do anything, your family will be struggled against." When she went back and told him, Liu Zuomin was even more afraid. The next morning, just as he was worrying about what to do, Bai Quansheng sent his lackey Liu Tianru to Liu Zuomin's house to ask: "Who is accusing our Chairman Bai?" Liu Zuomin said: "I don't know, I certainly didn't accuse him." Liu Tianru said again: "You can't not know." After Liu Tianru left, Liu Zuomin was even more afraid, feeling that he couldn't live anyway, so he hanged himself outside the village. After Bai Quansheng discovered this, he deliberately pretended to look surprised, ran out and said: "I don't know who killed our basic masses, this person's death is really a pity!" Back in the village, he also held a mass meeting, and said to the masses: "I don't know which bad element killed Liu Zuomin, this person is really a pity, our cadres just want to cry."

    When Bai Quansheng saw district cadres going to someone's house, he would go to that house and ask: "What did the district cadres say to you? What did you say to them?" Making the masses afraid to say anything. Recently, Comrade Zhao Fushan, a district cadre, went to his village to carry out in-depth work, and Bai Quansheng also sent two people to follow him constantly.

    洛尔峪农会主席白泉生
    逼死贫雇刘作民
    代笔者兴仁、景文
    邢台七区洛尔峪村农会主席兼合作社经理白泉生，抗战前是富农，后来成了破落户。过去当农会主席，曾经垮过两次，这是第三次上台，并兼合作社经理。他和村长、武委会主任是一股劲，他搞着个破鞋叫刘桂芝。群众见了他不能叫名字，总得叫“白主席”。叫刘桂芝是“刘参议”（她是县参议员）。白泉生和刘桂芝是明铺夜盖（刘的婆家是营头人，前年离了婚就没走，经常住在洛尔峪），还给她分了一座好房子。今冬连抗属们都没柴火，白泉生却强迫群众给刘桂芝打了一房顶好柴。白泉生在前几年没收汉奸家产时，贪污了二十匹布，都给了刘桂芝。
    去年群运时，群众因为怕他，要给“白主席”分房子。他口头上说：“咱是干部，先尽群众分吧”。实际上他把果实里的石头、木料完全拿了，还拿了七八布袋谷子，说是盖房子用。今年春天他要盖房子，强迫群众给他“乐款”（捐款的意思）四十万元，又在合作社抽了十万元。共盖了一串半院（二十八间），没用他自己一点东西。盖房用的工，还是群众“送的”，他只是拿上群众果实，做了些饭。现在他家住的房子，连上过去旧有的，共三串院子、两座楼。在“乐款”时，白泉生非叫放了半辈子羊、去年才从外村回来的雇贫刘作成“乐款”不行，刘作成没有钱，白泉生就查封了他的房子，三个月不叫他回家。白泉生盖房子用啥石头，就到刘作成院里起（刘作成分的是个破院，除一个好房子外，其他房都塌了）。还把刘作成的大门摘了，按到刘桂芝门上。
    有一个贫雇叫刘作民，秋天把手砍伤，不能上地，好在街上走，今冬参加了贫雇小组。白泉生就吓唬他说：“你不生产，还参加什么贫雇组，打算斗干部？”刘作民是个生产小组长，开会也不叫他去。这时，就有坏人乘机威胁刘作民说：“人家想斗争你呀，这次连会也不叫你参加了”。刘作民自此以后非常害怕。又有一次村里开妇女会，散会后别人都走了，偏把刘作民的儿媳妇留下，白泉生给她说：“你家翻身了，你老公公和你婆子，现在啥也不干，你哥哥还在中央军里，如果你们再不动弹，就要斗争你家。”他回去一说，刘作民更害了怕。第二天早晨正发愁的没办法，白泉生就叫他手下的狗腿刘天如到刘作民家问：“到底是谁告咱白主席来？”刘作民说：“我不知道，我反正没有告他。”刘天如又说：“你不能不知道。”刘天如走后，刘作民更加害怕，觉得自己反正是活不成，就到村外上吊死了。白泉生发觉这事后，还故意装样子，跑出去说：“不知谁把咱基本群众害死了，这人死的真可惜呀！”回村里还开了个群众会，给群众说：“不知哪个坏分子害死刘作民，这人真可惜，我们干部光想哭”。
    白泉生看见区干部到谁家，就到谁家问：“区干部给你说些啥？你给他们说过什么？”弄的群众都不敢吭。最近区干部赵富山同志在他村深入搞工作，白泉生还派了两个人经常跟着他。
