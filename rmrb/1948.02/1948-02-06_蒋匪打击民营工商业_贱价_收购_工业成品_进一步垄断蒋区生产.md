Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Comprehensive news from various sources: The Chiang government has recently promulgated and implemented a new economic measure, stipulating that during the period when banks stop industrial and commercial loans, the banks and treasuries of the four major families will purchase finished products and raw materials from various factories. The Chiang bandit's Joint Treasury has formulated "Temporary Measures for Shanghai National (Four Major Families) Banks and Treasuries to Purchase Finished Products on Behalf of the (Chiang) Government," and since the 30th of last month, the Chiang bandit's banks and treasuries have begun accepting applications from manufacturers for "purchase" cases. This "purchase" will also begin soon in Peiping and Tianjin, and it is stipulated that the "purchase" price will "in principle be based on the average market price for the six days prior to the date of approval of the application." This fully proves that the real purpose of the so-called "stopping loans to prevent speculation and hoarding" implemented by the Chiang government since November of last year is only to attack private industry and commerce, so that the four major families can further monopolize production in the Chiang-controlled areas and make greater speculative profits.

Since the Chiang bandits implemented the suspension of loans, private industry and commerce have suffered severely. Manufacturers have been forced to rely on high-interest black market loans to survive due to capital difficulties. Industrial groups in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin have all requested the Chiang bandit authorities to immediately resume loans. The Chiang government not only ignored this, but also took advantage of the fact that manufacturers needed money more urgently during the Lunar New Year holiday and faced a more serious crisis. On the one hand, it insisted on its principle of "definitely not considering resuming loans before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month," and on the other hand, it issued banknotes in large quantities to purchase and hoard physical goods at low prices, in order to sell them at higher prices and make huge profits. Private industry is further plunged into a desperate situation of bankruptcy and being annexed under the two steps of "stopping loans" and "purchasing" by the Chiang bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Private factories in Qingdao are closing down one after another. According to the Qingdao industrial and commercial delegation that recently went to Nanjing to petition the Chiang bandits, the reasons for the closure of factories in the city are: the Chiang bandit officials monopolize fuel, resulting in a lack of power; restrictions on foreign exchange quotas increase the cost of raw materials; more importantly, the Chiang bandits levy heavy taxes regardless of how much the manufacturers lose. At present, less than 40% of the factories in Qingdao are operating, and some of them are operating only half-time or intermittently. According to a Hong Kong magazine, as early as June of last year, 38 dyeing and weaving factories in Qingdao had closed down, and in July, dozens of rubber, hardware, and general merchandise businesses also went bankrupt one after another. The Chinese-owned match factory, which employed 20,000 workers, has also almost completely shut down. The local Chiang bandit government's gazette admits that among the city's 700,000 people, 100,000 workers have lost their jobs and can only fill their stomachs with chaff and tree bark.

    蒋匪打击民营工商业
    贱价“收购”工业成品  进一步垄断蒋区生产
    【新华社陕北三日电】综合各方消息：蒋政府近又颁布实行一项经济新措施，规定在银行停止工商贷款期间，由四大家族的银行局库收购各工厂制成品及原料品。蒋匪四联总处已订定“上海国家（四大家族）行局代（蒋）政府收购成品临时办法”，并自上月三十日起蒋匪各银行局库已开始接受厂商申请“收购”案件办理收购。平津方面也即将开始此项“收购”，且规定“收购”价格“依核准申请之日期前六日平均市价为原则”。此事充分证明：蒋政府去年十一月以来实行之所谓“停止贷款以防投机囤积”，其真正目的只是打击民营工商业，便于四大家族进一步垄断蒋区生产，作更大投机牟利而已。
    蒋匪自实行停止贷款以来，民营工商业惨遭打击，各厂商均因资金困难被迫依赖高利黑市贷款苟延残喘，沪、平、津各地工业团体均曾要求蒋匪当局立即恢复贷款，蒋政府不但置之不理，反借此旧历年关各厂商需款更急、面临更严重危机之时，一面坚持其“旧历正月十五日前决不考虑恢复贷款”之原则，一面又滥发纸币大量贱价搜购囤积实物，以便在物价更高时抛售谋取厚利。而民营工业便在蒋匪“停贷”“收购”两个步骤下，进一步陷入破产与被并吞的绝境。
    【新华社陕北三日电】青岛民间工厂纷纷停闭。据最近赴南京向蒋匪请愿之青岛工商业代表团透露，该市工厂停闭原因为：蒋匪官方垄断燃料，致动力缺乏；限制外汇额，使其原料成本增高；更重要者，为蒋匪不管各厂商如何亏折，尚勒收重税。现青市工厂开工者尚不及百分之四十，其中若干且系半开工和处于时断时续状态。又据香港某杂志载：青市远在去年六月即有染织厂三十八家停业，七月份又有橡皮、五金及百货业数十家相继倒闭。拥有二万工人的华商火柴厂亦几乎全部歇业。当地蒋匪政府公报供认：在全市七十万人口中，已有十万工人失业，彼等只能以糠和叶树皮充饥。
