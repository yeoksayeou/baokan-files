    [Jinan News] In Yunbiwu Village, Wu'yi County, last year, there was a vigorous struggle for a while, but the landlords still cultivate a lot of good land, hire long-term laborers, live in tall buildings, and eat like fat pigs. Ji Shouchang's family has three residences, all with brick walls on all six sides, and gold-lettered plaques hanging on the doors. The whole family is well-dressed. Ji Changju's family has six people and thirty-eight mu of good land. Ji Dianchen's family of five has seven residences. Yin Xingbang's family of six has six residences. The whole family does not work and hires a long-term laborer. Liu Xiwu's family of one (Liu ran away, leaving only his wife) lives in eight large brick houses. Now let’s look at the lives of us poor people! The family of Dong Gangchen, a hired poor peasant, has five people and five mu of alkaline land. The grain they eat now is so dry that it cannot be formed into lumps. Gangchen weaves socks every day to earn a living for his family. He said: "I am like a big swallow. If I can't find food for one day, the whole family will have to starve." He lives in two small broken houses belonging to others. His family of five only has two small, tattered quilts. Zhao Fengsheng's family of four wears clothes that expose their skin, and four people share a small quilt. Huang Er's family of six has only six and a half mu of alkaline land and two dilapidated houses. The grain harvested this year is not enough for the whole family to eat for a month. Huang Zhishao, Dong Baozhen, and others are all extremely poor. They said in unison: "The value of our homes is not even worth one of Ji Shouchang's houses. Our ten mu of land cannot compare to one mu of his. If we are talking about truly turning things over, we are still far from it!"

    云碧务村贫雇说：穷人十亩地不如地主一亩
    【冀南消息】武邑云碧务去年轰轰烈烈闹了一阵子斗争，但地主们还是种着很多好地，雇着长工，住着高楼大厦，吃的和肥猪一样。纪寿昌家三处宅子，都是六面挂砖，门上挂着金字大匾，全家都穿的很强。纪长居家六口人，还有三十八亩好地。纪殿臣家五口人有七处宅子。尹兴帮家六口人有六处宅子，全家不劳动，雇着一个长工。刘锡武家一口人（刘逃跑了，只剩下他老婆），住着八间大砖房。再看看咱穷人的生活吧！雇贫董刚臣家五口人，有五亩硷地，现吃的禾子干粮团不成块。刚臣天天织袜子，赚着一家子吃。他说：“我就好比一个大燕子，一天打不了食来一家子就得饿着。”他住着别人的两间小破厦子，五口人只两条小破烂被子。赵凤升家四口人穿的衣裳露着肉，四人一床小被子。黄二家六口人只有六亩半硷地，两间破屋，今年打的粮食不够全家吃一个月。黄志少、董宝珍等家家都穷的够劲，他们齐声说：“咱这些家的家还不值纪寿昌的一座房，咱十亩地也顶不住人家的一亩，要说翻身，差的还远哩！”
