Editor's Note

Comrades Peasants:

Our newspaper welcomes everyone to accuse landlords of their crimes here, expose shortcomings in our work, promote things that our peasants think are good and appropriate, and put forward your demands and suggestions for improving work. All the organizations, groups, and individuals mentioned by everyone must express their attitude. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to everyone's opinions should accept them and act accordingly. If there are any inaccuracies, explanations can be made and different opinions can be presented. If you can write, write it yourself. If you can't write, you can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write it for you, or you can come to the newspaper yourself. If that's not possible, write a letter to the newspaper and let us know, and we can find a way to help.

I am from Bian Village, Zhao County. My husband is called Gao Laoxun, and he is 58 years old this year. Since he was a child, he has been a hired laborer. For the first thirty years, he worked as a hired laborer in Licun, working there for thirty years. After the Japanese came, my Xiaolian (her son) was only a teenager. He also came to Licun to herd sheep for the landlord. In 1934, when my Xiaolian was nineteen years old, he went to Macun to herd sheep for Ren Laoting (landlord). The sheep owner falsely accused my child of shearing his sheep's wool, threatened him with a knife, and insisted on sending him to the garrison. My Xiaolian was so scared that he jumped into a well and died. Speaking of this, she raised her head, as if thinking about the past again, with tears in her eyes. She continued: "Don't mention it. His father was honest and couldn't afford to offend people. He wrapped him in a mat and buried him in a broken kiln pit east of Licun Village. I cried for several days, until my eyes were blind from crying." After the Japanese devils were defeated, my old man no longer worked as a hired laborer. He joined the peasant association and planned to turn over a new leaf here. Last year, he only received five mu of land, and he had no livestock or furniture. This year, the old man was sick for half a year, and because there was no furniture, the land was also barren. The village cadres took the land back, and there was no food to eat at home. This year, I have been grinding flour for people, earning one or two bran wotou a day. I eat one and take one back for the old man to eat. If there is no one to grind flour, I can't earn anything and I have to go hungry. My old man was sick for half a year, and sometimes he couldn't even eat bran wotou. This autumn, he died of illness and starvation. After his death, we couldn't afford a coffin. He was carried naked to the broken kiln pit and buried with my Xiaolian, his father and son together. He was buried very shallowly, and the dogs ate his corpse. His white bones are still lying outside." She paused, tears falling from her eyes. She raised her gray and tattered cotton-padded sleeve to her eyes and wiped them. Then, very sadly, she said, "I have no money to buy cotton to spin, so I have to beg for food, asking people for some chaff, vegetables, and bean dregs, or steamed wotou with vegetables." She picked up a wotou made of bean dregs mixed with chaff, with no grain at all, and said, "A few days ago, the village cadres held a meeting at the people's school and said: The higher authorities have ordered us not to allow begging anymore, and said they want to drive me out of the village! How can I live like this?"

    赵县郜老训老婆控诉地主
    她到如今还在讨吃过日子
    （世杰代笔）
    编者按
    农民们：
    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。
    我是赵县边村人。我男人叫郜老训，今年五十八岁了。自小当长工，头三十年到里村当长工，一直干了三十年。日本来后，俺小连（她的儿子）才十几岁，也到里村来给地主放羊，三十四年俺小连十九岁时，到马村给任老亭（地主）放羊，羊主诬赖我孩子剪了他的羊毛，拿刀子吓唬俺小连，并且非送到警备队不行，俺小连害怕的跳井死了。说到这里她抬起头来，好象又想过去的事情，眼里含着泪珠。接着说：别提啦，他爹老实也惹不起人家，用个席片包住埋到里村村东破窑坑里了。我哭了几天，一直哭的把眼也哭瞎了。日本鬼被打走后，我老头子也不做长工了，参加了农会，打算在这里翻身。在去年只分到五亩地，牲口家具啥都没有，今年老头害了半年病，因没家具地也荒了，村干部又把地给要走啦，家里也没粮食吃。今年一年来，我给人家推磨，一天赚一两个糠窝窝，我吃一个拿回去给老头吃一个，碰一天没人磨面就啥也赚不下了，就得饿起来。我老头因病了半年，有时糠窝也吃不上，在今年秋天，病饿而死了。死后也买不起棺材，光着身子抬到破窑坑里和俺小连他父子两个埋到一块了，埋的很浅，叫狗把尸首给吃了，白骨头还在外边扔着。停了一下眼里掉下泪来，她举起灰白的破袄袖到眼上擦了一下，接着很难过的说，我纺花也没钱买花，只好要饭吃，给人家要些糠菜和豆渣或菜蒸窝吃。她拿起豆渣掺糠没一点粮食的窝窝头说：头几天村干部在民校开会说：上级命令不叫要饭吃了，并说要把我赶出村去！这样怎么过呢？
