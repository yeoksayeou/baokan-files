On the Incompatibility of Shortcomings and the Seriousness of the Bolsheviks
By Sliepov
Translated by Su Ying

The Communist Party is the mortal enemy of stagnation and conservatism. It is never satisfied with the achievements it has made, but always looks forward. From the essence of our party and its revolutionary spirit arises the Bolshevik incompatibility with shortcomings. "A ruthless exposure of one's own shortcomings is essential for all vibrant political parties. There is nothing worse than complacent optimism." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 7, p. 305)

Pride, arrogance, and complacency are alien to the Bolshevik Party members. Lenin and Stalin rebuked those staff who were content with certain achievements and forgot their shortcomings. At the 15th National Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin said to these people: "Having two or three major achievements makes them arrogant, and having two or three more major achievements makes them proud and indifferent to everything."

To show the Bolshevik intolerance of shortcomings means not to be carried away by victory, not to relax work because of even a small temptation, to clearly see the problems that have not yet been solved, and to face the mistakes squarely.

Everyone knows that shortcomings are easier to correct if they are not allowed to develop. Mistakes often start small, but when they are not noticed, they develop into big mistakes. "Everyone is likely to have sores, but if the sores begin to fester, they may become incurable." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 26, p. 99) We should cultivate our most valuable quality - being able to see, expose, and prevent shortcomings as soon as they occur. Therefore, some individual staff members are afraid of being seen as inadequate and fabricate various excuses to cover up or evade shortcomings in order to "pretend to be innocent." This is intolerable. The Bolshevik Party cannot treat people or things from the point of view of personal or temporary interests, but should always stand above the interests of the state and objectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of its work.

Not hiding shortcomings - this is a constant requirement for leaders, but that is not all. What is important is to be good at sincerely exposing the root causes of shortcomings and finding ways to correct them. Bolshevik leaders cannot evade responsibility and cannot bow down in the face of difficulties - they must do everything in their power to overcome them. What is the use if the staff only knows to lament the difficulties without truly fighting them?

The incompatibility with shortcomings is manifested in the Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. How can we expose shortcomings without public criticism and analysis? Criticism and self-criticism are the real driving force and powerful weapons mastered by our party.

Bolshevik self-criticism is a method of exposing and correcting errors in leadership. We need self-criticism as much as we need air and water. Comrade Stalin said: "I believe that without self-criticism, our party cannot move forward, cannot expose our sores, and cannot eliminate our shortcomings."

The incompatibility with shortcomings means that leaders should be very serious in their work, not sloppy, not decide issues based on family and friends, but have a high degree of seriousness, so that they can expose shortcomings in time, find ways to correct them, and correctly educate cadres.

A truly serious spirit does not allow for accommodation because of "position" and "merit." It should apply equally to good and bad staff. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Some people often think that this seriousness is only used to treat bad staff, and regard it as a special whip in the hands of leaders, used to deal with lazy people. This view is incorrect. It is harmful to work and cadre education. Let's take such a fact as an example. For a long time, the "New Brass" machine trust station in the Saradov Province, led by Comrade Achikin, was considered an advanced station. Everything was done well, and its leaders received endless praise, but no shortcomings in their work were pointed out. Therefore, Comrade Achikin also felt that he was a truly perfect person, and became complacent. When it came to harvesting crops, he said, "We don't have to worry about anything, we will finish harvesting first anyway." As a result of this relaxation, the station started the harvesting campaign very late. What was the result? As a result, the machine tractor station led by Comrade Achikin fell behind in harvesting and delayed the harvesting of the collective farms supplied by its tractors.

Even good staff are not immune to making mistakes and having shortcomings; without this seriousness, even good staff do not have a critical spirit towards their work. Bolshevik seriousness means: to examine people based on the effect of their work. This examination is not based on some fragmented "shock" work, but on constant work, constantly supervising the implementation of instructions, which can cultivate accuracy and seriousness in the staff. No matter how much you say about the necessity and benefits of discipline, if the decisions made are quickly forgotten, discipline will be abandoned and laxity will occur, and as a result, the sense of responsibility will be lost.

To be serious means to organize leadership in such a way that any act of undermining the party's instructions cannot escape accountability. In this regard, not only top-down inspection plays a great role, but that alone is not enough. Stalin instructed the importance of bottom-up inspection, that is, the led inspect the leaders, expose their mistakes, and point out ways to correct these mistakes. The method for party members and the masses to inspect their leaders at activist meetings and delegate meetings is to listen to their summary reports, criticize their shortcomings, and elect or not elect them to leading organs. Without such inspection, cadres cannot be correctly educated with a spirit of incompatibility with errors and shortcomings.

Seriousness in work and bureaucratic management - crude "responsibility" - have nothing in common. Bureaucratic management is a product of ignorance, a result of lack of leadership. Such phenomena occur in places that do not study the essence of things, do not have correct cadre deployment, attempt to monopolize everything, do not absorb knowledgeable people to participate, do not study the experience of the masses, and do not consider the opinions of the collective of party staff.

Bureaucratic management means that orders and leadership do not rely on activists. The task of leadership lies precisely in uniting activists and organizing the deployment actions of staff from various departments in order to "advance work not independently, but should be organized, united, and thus obtain the greatest guarantee of success" (Zhdanov).

Accompanying bureaucratic management is the frequent transfer of cadres, but little do they know that the organizational work of handling cadres itself contains an educational component. Good leadership is first and foremost the education and training of cadres, and providing them with practical assistance; of course, punishment also has its educational significance, but if punishment is abused, it will not become a method of education, because cadres will not care about punishment.

There are also situations where firm disposal is needed, but the leadership goes on to persuade, and when they see that the staff has made mistakes, the leadership hesitates and replaces punishment with a liberal attitude.

Let's take the facts of the Udmurt Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) as an example. There is no seriousness in dealing with staff here. The construction design trust led by Baier himself behaved improperly and deceived his superiors, but the provincial committee did not expose such staff, but instead sheltered him and protected him, damaging our cause. Moreover, such facts are not isolated phenomena. This is not consolidating discipline, but causing serious damage to cadre education.

Correctly educating cadres does not mean uniting them through private friendship, covering up their shortcomings, and accommodating their self-esteem. Party staff should have a basic precept for themselves - do not accommodate individual personnel, no matter how high their position, but only respect the cause, respect the interests of the cause. This is how Comrade Stalin taught us.

In some individual cases, leaders are afraid of being accused of bureaucratic management and dare not strictly demand the implementation of the party's instructions, and blame seriousness as superfluous. This can only be the case for those who only want to live a comfortable life and, after achieving their first success, look up to the sky and become complacent. If a leader acts for the benefit of the cause, he works hard, he can demand that others be like him, then what is wrong with this seriousness for him?

Seriousness and incompatibility with shortcomings are only possible for those leaders who are truly free from bureaucratic habits. Staff who lack principle in their work and do not restrain their actions associate themselves with those who are sycophantic and unscrupulous. Such staff show helplessness in the struggle against shortcomings and sins. Here, the atmosphere of mutual protection and sentimentalism replaces principle and seriousness.

Comrade Stalin pointed out how much harm such non-Bolshevik habits as sentimentalism and mutual protection can cause, and that these things will eventually lead to mutual forgiveness of mistakes. He said: "For example, Zhang San, a senior leader of a certain organization, made a big mistake and messed things up, but Li Si is unwilling to criticize him, unwilling to expose and correct his mistakes. He is unwilling to criticize because he does not want to 'make enemies for himself.' What's the big deal if he makes mistakes and messes things up?! Who among us doesn't make mistakes?! Today we forgive him - Zhang San, and tomorrow he can forgive me - Li Si, because how can he be sure that I won't make mistakes?! How nice it is for everyone to be polite and get along peacefully! Letting mistakes go by - does this harm our great cause? Nothing, just deal with it. Comrades, this is the common view of some of our responsible comrades, but what does this mean? We Bolsheviks are people who criticize the whole world, and who, in Marx's words, are people who turn the world upside down. If we give up self-criticism in order to avoid bothering certain comrades, there will be no other result than overturning our great cause. Isn't this obvious?"

Wherever family-style problem-solving prevails, there is no seriousness, and there is tolerance of shortcomings and errors, and often even tolerance of sins.

Let's take such an example: Not long ago, the State Inspection Agency of the Kyrgyz League Republic discovered facts of randomly distributing goods, privately supplying, and violating financial discipline when inspecting the work of the republic's agricultural supply department. The supply department did a very poor job of the work stipulated for machine tractor station repair factories, workshops, collective farms, and supplying machines and machine parts. The leaders of the Kyrgyz Republic's Ministry of Agriculture knew that the supply department was doing a very poor job, and treated some of its staff liberally. They did not point out the significant harm of this activity, and did not show the necessary seriousness. If you ask why this is, it is because the leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture themselves sometimes participated in such illegal behavior. They wasted a large amount of cloth allocated to machine tractor stations, agricultural technology schools, and ordinary schools in violation of regulations, and distributed part of it to the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and the supply department, and randomly distributed other items.

For these reasons, the leaders of the department were to some extent involved with the staff of the lower-level supply department, and lost their weapons in the struggle against the serious shortcomings in their work. This illustrates how important the ideological purity of leaders is in their relationship with those they supervise!

Party staff give direction to cadres in various work departments. Comrade Stalin's words about the Soviet Party inspectors are more important to Party staff than to anyone else. Comrade Stalin said: "They should be pure and flawless, and pursue the truth, so that they can not only have formal authority, but also have ideological authority to examine and educate others."

Ideological education is the most important condition for educating cadres in the seriousness of their work and their incompatibility with shortcomings. Studying the theories of Marxism-Leninism can deeply understand the party's policies, and thus improve each staff member's sense of responsibility and obligation to the state. Only conscious and ideologically trained people can understand their obligations to the party and their responsibility to the party.

Incompatibility with shortcomings and a high degree of seriousness have been and still are the basis for correctly educating cadres.

    论对缺点的不调和性及布尔什维克的严肃性
    斯列波夫作
    苏瑛译
    共产党是对于停滞不进及保守主义的死敌，从来不满足于已获得的成绩，而总是向前看，从我党的本质及其革命的精神中，产生了对缺点的布尔什维克的不调和性。“对本身缺点无情的揭露是一切生动活泼的政党所必需的，没有比自满的乐天主义再坏的事了。”（列宁全集七卷三百零五页）
    骄傲自负、泰然自若和布尔什维克党人是没有因缘的，列宁和斯大林责备这样一些工作人员，对他们来说只要有某些成绩就足以使他们苟安自满，而忘记缺点。斯大林在联共（布）第十五次全国代表大会上，对这部分人说：“只要有两三个大的成绩就已目空一切，要再有两三个大的成绩就骄傲起来，百事不在乎了。”
    对缺点表现布尔什维克的不能容忍态度，这就是说不因胜利而冲昏头脑，不因即使是很小的诱惑而松懈工作，清楚地看见尚未解决的问题，要正视错误。
    大家知道如果不让缺点发展下去，那它是比较容易改掉的，错误经常是从很小开始，可是当它不被人所注意的时候，它就发展成大的错误。“所有的人都可能害疮，但如果这个疮开始腐烂时，就可能变成不治之症。”（列宁全集第二十六卷九十九页）我们应该培养自己最宝贵的品质——当缺点刚一发生的时候，就要善于看出、揭穿，并预防它。因此有些个别的工作人员，害怕对自己不如意，而杜撰各种辩词来掩盖或者逃避缺点，以“故作清白”。这就是不可容忍的事。布尔什维克的党不能以个人利益或者暂时利益的观点去对待人或事物，而应该永远站在国家利益之上，客观地估计工作中的优点和缺点。
    不隐瞒缺点——这是对领导者不变的要求，但这还不是事情的全部，而重要的是善于诚心诚意地揭发产生缺点的根源，及找到纠正缺点的方法。布尔什维克的领导人不能够逃避责任，不能在困难面前低头，——他必须尽其全力来克服它。假如工作人员只知道困难悲叹，而不真正的同困难作斗争，那有什么用处呢？  
    对缺点的不调和性，表现在布尔什维克的批评和自我批评上，如不公开批评，并分析缺点，那怎么叫做揭发缺点呢？批评和自我批评是我党所掌握的真正动力和强大武器。
    布尔什维克的自我批评，是暴露和纠正领导方面错误的方法，我们需要自我批评象需要空气和水一样。斯大林同志说：“我认为没有自我批评，我们党就不能前进，就不能揭发我们的疮疾，就不能消灭我们的缺点”。
    对缺点的不调和性，这就是说：领导者应该是在工作中很严肃，不是马马虎虎，不是从家庭、亲友方式决定问题，而是有高度的严肃性，这才能及时揭露缺点，找到纠正缺点的途径，正确地教育干部。
    真正的严肃精神，不容因“职位”和“功勋”而有所迁就，它应该同样的适用于好的和不好的工作人员。可惜并不经常是这样的，有人常常认为这种严肃精神只拿去对待不好的工作人员，把它看成是领导者手中的特种鞭子，为对付懒惰的人使用的。这种意见是不正确的，它有害于工作及干部教育。拿这样的事实作例吧，就是从阿赤金同志所领导的萨拉多夫省“新布拉斯”机器托拉斯站，在很长时间中都认为是先进的站，该站一切工作都作得挺好，它的领导能受到无限赞扬，但没有指出他们工作中的缺点，因此阿赤金同志也觉得自己真正是十全十美的人了，而自满自足起来了，到收割庄稼的时候，他说道：“我们没有什么可着急的，反正我们会先收割完”。这样松懈的结果，使得该站很迟的才开始收割运动，而结果怎样呢？结果阿赤金同志所领导的机器拖拉机站，在收割方面落后了，并拖延了被它供给拖拉机的集体农场的收割。
    就是很好的工作人员也不保险不犯错误，没有缺点；要是缺乏这种严肃性，就是好的工作人员对待自己工作也没有批评的精神了。布尔什维克的严肃性就是说：要根据人民工作的效果来审查他们，这种审查不是根据某种片断的“突击”工作，而是根据经常的工作，不断的对执行指令、指示加以监督，能培养工作人员的准确性及严肃性，不管你说了多少关于纪律的必要及好处，而作出的决议很快就被忘记的话，那就会废弛纪律，发生散漫，结果责任心就一定丧失。
    要有严肃性，这就是说：要这样的组织领导，使得任何破坏党的指令的行为不能不受到追究。在这一方面起着很大作用的，不仅是自上而下的审查，单单这样还不够，斯大林曾指示自下而上进行审查的重要性，即被领导者审查领导者，揭发他们的错误，指出纠正这些错误的办法。党员群众在积极分子会议上，在代表会议上，来审查自己的领导者的方法，就是听取他们总结报告，批评他们的缺点，选举或不选举他们到领导机关去。没有这样的审查，就不能够用对错误和缺点的不调和精神，来正确地教育干部。
    工作中的严肃性和官僚管理——粗暴的“负责”，是没有任何共同之点的。官僚管理是一种无知的产物，是缺乏领导的结果，不会研究事物的本质，没有正确的配备干部，企图个人独断一切，不吸收懂事的人参加，不研究群众的经验，不考虑党工作人员集体的意见的地方，就有这样的现象。
    官僚管理就是说：命令和领导不依靠积极分子。而领导上的任务，恰在团结积极分子，需要组织各种不同部门工作人员的配备行动，以便“推进工作不是各自为政、各干各的，而是应该组织起来，团结起来，因而获得成功的最大保证”（日丹诺夫语）。
    伴随官僚管理而来的，照例是时常调换干部，殊不知处理干部的组织工作，本身就包含有教育的成份。好的领导，首先是教育和训练干部，并给他们以实际的帮助；当然处罚也有其教育意义，但要是滥用处罚，就不成其为教育的方法，因为干部会对处罚不在乎了。
    也有这样的情况：需要坚决的处置时，而领导上却去进行劝说，看到工作人员有过失时，领导上却犹豫不决，以自由主义的态度代替了处罚。
    就拿联共（布）乌得幕尔特省委的事实作例子，在这里没有对待工作人员的严肃性，巴依叶尔领导的建筑设计托拉斯，他本人行为不正，欺瞒上级，而省委不去揭露这种工作人员，反而包庇他，掩护他，去损害我们事业，而且这样的事实不是个别的现象，这不是巩固纪律，而是使干部教育受到严重的损失。
    正确的教育干部，并不是用私人朋友关系来团结他们，掩护他们的缺点，姑息他们的自尊心。党的工作人员，应该对自己有一个基本的训诫——不要姑息个别的人员，不管他们有多么高的职位，只是要尊重事业，尊重事业的利益。斯大林同志是这样教导我们的。
    在某些个别的情况下，领导工作者害怕别人责备他为官僚管理，不敢严格的要求执行党的指令，责难严肃性是多余的，这只可能是这样一些人：他们只想轻松的生活，并在取得第一个成功之后，就仰首天外，自满自慰。假如一个领导者他是为事业的利益而行动，他努力工作，他可以要求别人和他一样，那么这种严肃性对他有什么不好呢？
    对缺点的严肃性及不调和性，只有那些真正不受官僚习气的领导人，才有可能的。在工作中没有原则性，对自己行动不约束的工作人员，就使自己同那些阿谀奉承不正派的人同流合污了。这样的工作人员，在同缺点和罪过作斗争中，表现了束手无策，这里互相包庇及温情主义的风气，就代替了原则性和严肃性。
    斯大林同志曾指出：象温情主义及互相包庇这种非布尔什维克的习气，会发生多大的害处，最后这些东西必至引向相互原谅错误。他说：“譬如说某个组织的高级领导者张三犯了很大的错误，并且把事情搞坏了，但是李四不愿批评他，不愿揭露和纠正他的错误。不愿批评是因为不愿意‘给自己树立敌人’，犯了错误坏了事情这有什么要紧？！我们大家谁不犯错误呢？！今天我们原谅了他——张三，明天他就能原谅我——李四，因为怎么能保险我不犯错误呢？大家客客气气，和平相处多好呢？让错误放过去这就损害了我们的伟大事业么？没有什么，反正对付过去就行。同志，这是我们某些负责同志常有的议论，但这是什么意思呢？我们布尔什维克是批评整个世界的人，用马克斯的话来说是：翻天覆地的人，假如我们为了使某些同志不麻烦，而放弃自我批评，这除了倾覆我们的伟大事业而外，就不会有另外的结果，难道这还不明显么？”
    什么地方家庭式的解决问题占了上风，哪里就没有严肃性，哪里就容忍缺点和错误，甚至常常容忍罪过。
    我们举这样一个例子吧：不久前吉尔吉支盟员共和国的国家检查机关，在检查该共和国农业供给处的工作时，发现了乱分配货物，私自供给，违反财政纪律的事实，而该供给处把所规定对于机器拖拉机站修理工厂、作坊、集体农庄、供给机器及机器零件的工作做得很不好，吉尔吉支共和国农业部的领导人，明知供给处工作做得很不好，而且自由主义地对待他的某些工作人员、没有指出他们这种活动的重大损害，没有表现必须的严肃性，如果问这是为什么呢？就是因为该农业部的领导者本身，有时也参加了这种非法的行为，他们不按规定，比如把配给机器拖拉机站、农业技术学校及普通学校的很大数量的布匹浪费了，而且把一部分分给农业部及供给处的工作人员了，还乱分了其他的物品。
    由于这些缘故，该部的领导者在某种程度上，就和下级供给处的工作人员有了牵扯，而在同他们工作中的严重缺点作斗争中，就失去了武器。这一点说明了：同自己监督下的人员的互相关系中，领导者思想上的纯洁，是如何的重要啊！
    党的工作人员，是给各个工作部门的干部，在工作上指示方向的，斯大林同志关于苏维埃的党的监察人员说过的话，对于党的工作人员，比对任何其他的人员更为重要。斯大林同志说：“他们应该纯洁无瑕，追求真理，以求他们不仅能够有形式上的权威，而且要有思想上的权威来审查和教育别人”。
    思想教育是教育干部在工作中的严肃性，及对缺点之不调和性的最重要条件，研究马列主义的理论，能够深刻了解党的政策，而因此提高每个工作人员的责任心和对国家义务的感觉，只有自觉的和思想曾受锻炼的人，才能明白自己对党的义务，自己对党所负的责任。
    对缺点的不调和性，高度的严肃性，过去曾是现在也还是正确教育干部的基础。
