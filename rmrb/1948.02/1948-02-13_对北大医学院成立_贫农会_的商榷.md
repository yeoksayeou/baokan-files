    A Discussion on the Establishment of a "Poor Peasant Association" at Peking University Medical College
    To the Editor:
    After reading the first issue of the Peking University journal "Northern Communications" after its revision, I am very happy. This highest institution of learning in the border region has, in accordance with the spirit of the Land Conference of the entire region, launched a struggle to draw clear class lines and eliminate landlord ideology. This movement, as Principal Fan said, is to "fight for the purification of the Party at Peking University! Fight for the purification of the ranks of the masses! Fight for the purification of the thoughts of every comrade!"
    From some individual news and phrases, I also deeply feel that some viewpoints and practices need further mutual discussion:
    On January 9th, Peking University Medical College gathered eighty children of hired and poor peasants from the entire college to hold a forum and established a unified Poor Peasant Association, which is responsible for the class education of more than 500 people in the college. This method is worth considering. I believe that Peking University is a place led by the Party to educate, cultivate, and transform intellectual youth. The educational line of Peking University is also the one prescribed by Chairman Mao: the proletarian-led mass anti-imperialist and anti-feudal class line. Therefore, the educational purpose is to transform thinking, draw clear lines, strengthen class education, and overcome landlord and rich peasant ideology, and not something else. The establishment of the Poor Peasant Association at least objectively means mechanically transplanting the organizational form of class struggle in the countryside to the school. What will the Poor Peasant Association do? To struggle against landlords? However, the teachers and students in the school are mostly of landlord origin, and they have not participated in direct exploitation. Their thinking can be transformed, so they should not be treated as ordinary landlords. The relationship between teachers and students and between classmates in the school is equal, without political oppression or economic exploitation. Thus, if the Poor Peasant Association is established to deal with landlords, it is completely unfounded. Or, say: the establishment of the Poor Peasant Association is to undertake the task of class education. I think this ideological leadership task should be undertaken by the Party and the Student Committee of Peking University. It is permissible to absorb some good students from poor peasant backgrounds to participate in the leadership. In the study, it is perfectly right for students from poor peasant backgrounds to raise their class consciousness with their own personal experiences, but all this does not require the organization of a Poor Peasant Association. On the contrary, the establishment of the Poor Peasant Association hinders the possibility of close unity between students from poor peasant backgrounds and other broad students to jointly transform their thinking.

    对北大医学院成立“贫农会”的商榷
    编辑同志：
    读了北大校刊“北方通讯”改版第一号，我很高兴，这一边区最高学府已经按照全区土地会议精神开展了划清阶级界线，清除地主思想的斗争，这一运动，正如范校长所说的：是要“为北大党的纯洁化而战斗！为群众队伍的纯洁化而战斗！为每个同志的思想的纯洁化而战斗！”
    从某些个别消息和字句中，我也深深觉得有些观点和做法有进一步互相商榷之必要：
    一月九日北大医学院集合全院八十个雇贫子弟召开座谈会，成立了统一的贫农会，担任全院五百多人的阶级教育的任务，这个办法是值得考虑的，我觉得北大是党领导的教育培养改造知识青年的场所，北大的教育路线也就是毛主席所规定的。无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的阶级路线，因此在教育目的上是改造思想、划清界限、加强阶级教育，克服地主富农思想，而不是其他；成立贫农会至少在客观上意味着把农村阶级斗争中的组织形式机械的搬运到学校中去。贫农会将要做些什么呢？为了对地主做斗争？可是学校里教员学生绝大部分只是地主成份，没有参加过直接剥削，他们的思想是能够改造的，因而不应该把他们当做一般的地主来看待，学校里师生间与同学间是平等的，没有政治上压迫与经济上剥削关系；这样，如果是为了对付地主而来成立贫农会，是完全没有根据的。或者说：成立贫农会是为了担负阶级教育任务，我觉得这一思想领导任务应由北大的党和学委会来担任，吸收某些出身贫雇的好同学参加领导是可以的，在学习中贫雇出身同学以自己的亲历身受提高阶级觉悟是完全应该的，但这一切并不需要组织贫农会，相反的，成立贫农会则是妨害贫雇农出身同学同其他广大同学亲密团结共同改造思想的可能。读者  若宁
