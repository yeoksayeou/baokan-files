    Communications and Exchanges
    No. 8
    Comrades participating in land redistribution in various regions:

    After you arrive in the villages, how do you approach the poor and hired peasants? How do you promote the land law and carry out redistribution? What problems and difficulties have you encountered in your work? How have you resolved them? What mistakes have you made, and how have you corrected them? What experiences have you gained? Since your self-rectification campaign, what changes and gains have you made in your thinking through the test of the redistribution movement? What new progress have you made? What is the overall situation in the villages where you are working, what are its characteristics, and what specific problems are there? Please write to the newspaper about these matters in a timely manner. We will devote as much space as possible to publishing your contributions in the future. You can write in any form, such as letters, communications, work reports, or reflections. In short, write in whatever way you can express yourself clearly.

    通讯往来
    第八号
    各地参加土地平分的同志：
    你们到村后，如何接近贫雇？如何宣传土地法开展平分？工作中碰到些什么问题和困难？如何解决的？犯了些什么错误，如何纠正？有些什么经验？你们自整党后，在平分运动的考验中，思想上有何变化和收获？有何新的进步？各村工作面貌如何，有何特点，有什么具体问题？这些都请你们及时写给报纸，我们今后将用最大篇幅发表。写法可以不拘形式，如写信，通讯，工作报告，反省都可以，总之，怎样能说得明白就怎样写。
