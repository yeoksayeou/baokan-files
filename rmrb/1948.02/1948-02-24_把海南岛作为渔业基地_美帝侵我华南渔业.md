　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Shanghai News: In order to strengthen its aggression against South China's fisheries, American imperialism has decided to use the southwest coast of Hainan Island as a base for the United States to "develop" South China's fisheries. Four UN relief and rehabilitation administration (UNRRA) fishing boats are already on their way to Hainan. Since August 1946, 126 UNRRA fishing boats have come to China one after another, invading the coastal waters of Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangdong, Taiwan, and Qingdao for fishing. Among those allocated to the Shanghai area, 24 went fishing during the May fishing season last year, catching more than 1.5 million catties of fish, accounting for 25% of the total Shanghai fish market. The number of fishing boats going out to sea during the October fishing season increased to 30, and further increased to more than 50 in December. As a result of the large-scale dumping of fish caught by UNRRA fishing boats in Shanghai, the fish market was crowded and the supply exceeded demand. Fish prices plummeted, causing a crisis of bankruptcy for Shanghai's general private fisheries. UNRRA fishing boats enjoy various privileges in China. They do not need to hold any licenses, nor do they need to declare or pay taxes. Since there is no cost, they can sell fish cheaply at will and still obtain huge profits.

　　把海南岛作为渔业基地
  　美帝侵我华南渔业
    【新华社陕北十八日电】上海消息：美帝为加强对华南渔业侵略，已决定以琼岛西南海岸为美国“发展”华南渔业基地，联总渔轮四艘已在驶琼途中。按自一九四六年八月起，陆续来华之联总渔轮已达一百二十六艘，分别侵入上海、厦门、广东、台湾、青岛沿海捕鱼。分配在上海区域活动者，去年五月份渔泛期出渔二十四艘，获鱼一百五十余万斤，占上海鱼市场总量百分之二十五，十月份渔泛期出渔渔轮增至三十艘，十二月份更增至五十余艘。联总渔轮获鱼在沪大肆倾售结果，渔货拥挤，供过于求，鱼价惨跌，使上海一般民营渔业面临破产危机。联总渔轮在华享有各种特权，可不持任何执照，也不需报关缴税，不需成本，故可任意贱价售鱼，而又能获得巨大利润。
