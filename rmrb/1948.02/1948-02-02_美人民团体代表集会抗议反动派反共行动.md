Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st dispatch: TASS, New York, 27th and 28th: American progressives continue to oppose the anti-communist and anti-people actions of American reactionaries. The Foreign Born Protection Committee recently held a meeting in Washington, planning to launch a large-scale movement to protest the U.S. government's persecution of American democratic leaders of foreign birth. Representatives of one hundred trade unions and other organizations attending the meeting demanded the repeal of current U.S. laws that discriminate against foreign-born people, and protested against the U.S. government's deportation of Bittman and Jones, leaders of the U.S. Communist Party, and twenty-one trade union activists. New York progressives support Communist Party member Jerson as a replacement for the late Communist New York City Councilor Carron, who passed away last November. They insisted that Carron was elected by 75,000 voters and condemned the obstruction of this by American reactionaries as "an illegal infringement of democratic rights."
