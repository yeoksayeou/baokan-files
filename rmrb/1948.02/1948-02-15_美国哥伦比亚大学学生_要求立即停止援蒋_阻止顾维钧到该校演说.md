Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: New York Dispatch: Following the American dockworkers' response to the call of the American Conference on China and Far Eastern Policy, deciding to ban the shipment of American imperialist aid materials for Chiang's war to China, American college students are also taking action to demand that the U.S. government stop aiding Chiang. According to the New York Student Committee for Democratic Far Eastern Policy, on the evening of the 5th of this month, more than 150 American college students formed a picket line outside the auditorium of Columbia University to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's ambassador to the U.S., Gu Weijun, from delivering a shameless speech at the university auditorium requesting aid from American reactionaries. In leaflets distributed by the students, they pointed out the various acts of terror caused by the Kuomintang (Chiang bandits) in China and demanded that the U.S. government immediately stop shipping arms to Chiang Kai-shek.

    【新华社陕北十一日电】纽约讯：继美国码头工人响应美国对华及远东政策会议号召，决定禁运美帝援蒋作战物资来华后，美国大学生亦以行动要求美政府停止援蒋。据纽约民主远东政策学生委员会宣称：本月五日黄昏，美国大学生一百五十余人，在哥伦比亚大学礼堂外布成纠察线，阻止蒋匪驻美大使顾维钧在该校礼堂发表要求美国反动派援助的无耻演说。学生们在所散发的传单中，指出国民党（蒋匪）在中国所造成的种种恐怖事实，并要求美政府立即停止运送军火给蒋介石。
