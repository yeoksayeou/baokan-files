　　Party Rectification Closely Combined with Democratic Movement
  　Zhao Village Masses Review Party Members
    [Our News] The Zhao Village branch in the Ninth District of Wu'an has three characteristics: First, the majority are of poor and hired peasant origin; second, they were developed from the three major movements of Anti-Maintenance, Rent Reduction and Debt Clearance, and Filling the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies (the most new party members were developed in the last one); third, they have consistently combined a few activists to replace the entire masses, thus forming a situation where the Party stood above the masses to fight against landlords and rich peasants. As a result, although the landlords and rich peasants were basically defeated, and Filling the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies was largely done on the surface, it was still a new kind of autocratic rule over the masses.
    Starting from this situation, the Zhao Village work team decided to take a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, the main force visited the masses to mobilize them (focusing on the poor and hired peasants), and on the other hand, three people were assigned to lead the rectification of the branch. At the beginning, a branch meeting was held to give party members a "Party Member Admonition," explaining the spirit of party rectification according to Chairman Mao's New Year's speech, and then they were divided into groups for self-criticism. A total of thirty-five people participated, divided into two groups. According to the situation revealed in the first round of self-examination:
    I. Composition: 24 poor and hired peasants, 9 middle peasants, 1 bankrupt landlord, and 1 unknown.
    II. Types of errors and number of offenders: According to their own self-criticism results, 9 people were overly aggressive in turning themselves over [after liberation], 9 were undemocratic – spoke rudely, 9 mutually took care of each other with power, 5 embezzled public funds for profit, 5 covered up the property of landlords and rich peasant relatives and friends, 7 stole fruit, 3 (relatively serious) frequented prostitutes, 1 was a petty thief, 10 evaded military service, 4 were lazy in labor after becoming cadres, and 1 forced a marriage. (Some people committed several types of errors).
    III. Several people with major errors: (1) Anti-Conscription Committee Member Jin Linyi: the son of a bankrupt landlord who had squandered his family fortune on eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling in his youth, becoming a hooligan. During Rent Reduction and Debt Clearance, he regained a share of his family property by settling accounts with his elder brother, but during last year's struggle, he openly shielded his elder brother. In life, he still ate and drank extravagantly, owing debts everywhere in the street, with no major difference from before. He did not admit his mistakes at all during this study session and has been suspended from party membership. (2) Anti-Conscription Director Jin Guoquan: According to dozens of opinions collected by party members from the masses, he was said to have embezzled a lot in the distribution of military shoes, and to have shielded landlords and been unfair in assigning tasks. He admitted the latter two items but did not admit to embezzlement, saying he had accounts to prove it. (3) Finance Director Jin Tongyuan: He used to be a bandit and ran a butcher shop. He worked in the village cooperative butcher shop and served as finance director. Some said he was corrupt and fed his own small sheep in the butcher shop, fattening them up to sell. He admitted the latter but denied being corrupt. (4) Farmers' Association Director Jin Suoze: Of poor peasant origin, he had been director for less than half a year, and his work style was extremely undemocratic, dictatorial, and arbitrary, without consulting other Farmers' Association members; he united with people from his own street to cover up corruption cases; especially after the promulgation of the Land Law, he convened a meeting of Farmers' Association cadres to conspire on a strategy for handing over fruit [of the struggle], which was opposed by his cadres. He also frightened other party members, saying: "We have now become political prisoners, don't believe in self-criticism;" and intimidated other members of middle peasant origin with his own background. After other comrades raised this, he not only did not accept it but immediately brought up the other shortcomings of the speaker to counter them.
    IV. Comprehensive branch situation as seen from the first self-criticism: (1) Overly aggressive in turning themselves over and undemocratic were general, even small cadres and small party members were more or less tainted with this style. (2) Major mistakes were made by senior cadres, but they were in the minority. (3) Small party members and small cadres were very active in raising opinions about each other, while senior cadres spoke very little. (4) Young people were less concerned about themselves and others, and their determination to reform was greater. (5) The materials talked about were either well-known or trivial. Truly unknown and more serious mistakes had not been talked about.
    At this time, the relationship between the Party and the masses: because some senior cadres had major problems, and small cadres and small party members often spoke from the standpoint of cadres, the masses regarded them as a gang, even including general non-party activists. Therefore, the preparatory members who were about to establish the Poor Peasants' Association were unwilling to have a single party member recommended to them. However, these small party members and small cadres also had no status within the Party. Compared with the good poor and hired peasants, they were not necessarily inferior in history and character, and they even surpassed them in political awareness and struggle experience, just because they had been involved with those senior cadres in some things, the masses closed them out, which was also a major loss in work and needed to be reversed. In the process of party rectification, several problems were encountered, and the work team handled them as follows: (1) Cadre Panic: After the promulgation of the Land Law, some cadre party members with excessive problems felt panic. This panic was inevitable. But at this time, these people insisted on dragging some relatively clean or less problematic cadres and party members along with them, so they said some precautionary words to them, or said "We seem to have all become political prisoners," or used the action of selling things to eat and drink heavily to influence them. After investigating these situations, they were convened to read the "Party Member Admonition" and the "Regulations on Punishment for Crimes of Sabotaging the Land Law," and it was explained that they would not be treated politely if they committed crimes in the future, and if they had committed crimes in the past and did not confess them, they would be punished in the same way if they were found out in the future. This had some effect and made them more honest. (2) Way Out: Because of the emphasis on stopping criminal behavior, the general party members felt that there was no way out, as if they had also committed crimes by following others. Therefore, at the second meeting, they talked about "Only honest reform is the way out." Although the content was still the "Party Member Admonition" and the part of Chairman Mao's New Year's report on party rectification, the focus was different, and it played a different role. The next day, they discussed it again, and the mood stabilized, and then they were divided into groups for self-criticism. (3) In-Depth Problem: In self-criticism, it was found that some people still held the same attitude as when washing their faces and wiping off the black spots, thinking that as long as they passed the test, they could continue to be cadres. Therefore, they avoided discussing basic issues or glossed over them, only looking for some trivial matters (such as taking a teacup from the fruit) to make up the numbers. At this time, the work team talked about the part of the "Farmer Admonition" about transforming the regime, telling them: Future regimes at all levels will be produced from the Farmers' Congress, and the village regime is re-elected every year. The Party will re-elect the branch committee and group leaders according to the Party Constitution. If you do not honestly criticize your mistakes to the masses, not to mention becoming a cadre in the future, it is doubtful whether anyone in the Farmers' Association will recommend you to join the association. In the future, the reformed party will not necessarily recognize you as a party member based on the opinions of the masses. Only in this way can their impure motives be dispelled, and they seem to be more conscious and serious afterward. (4) Firepower Problem: People with major problems were not easy to accept other people's opinions, and sometimes even brought up the other party's mistakes to attack them. Although this attitude had been severely criticized, it still could not form mass pressure. The next day, some relatively clean and active people were selected to convene a meeting of party member activists (because activists had not been reviewed by the masses, selection should be very cautious, and they should not be fixedly viewed). Their opinions on those people were solicited. At this meeting, they pointed out the basic mistakes of those people, saying them very systematically, and saying that they had always been afraid of those people, fearing retaliation. The work team encouraged them with the democratic direction in the future, which broke down some of their doubts – that is, telling them that people who made mistakes would no longer have the position to retaliate against others in the future. After this meeting, another review meeting was held with those who had major problems, and more basic opinions were raised. Only then did the use of organizational force to rectify the organization take shape, and those who were not honest felt real pressure. The formation of this pressure was also related to the firm attitude of the leadership. The work team said to those who resisted: Those who want to reflect can reflect, and those who don't want to can choose not to participate, you can decide for yourselves. This also put greater pressure on them.
    　　　　Village Assembly Announces Party Openly
    After visiting the poor and hired peasants, preliminary class division, and party rectification, the following three problems were discovered: (1) The masses could not figure out the bottom line of the work team and still had concerns, fearing that this time would be the same as washing their faces and wiping off the black spots. (2) Party rectification was carried out behind closed doors in the branch, without mass pressure, and the problem could not be solved. Some party members and cadres with many problems and major errors did not reflect. (3) The poor and hired peasants who had been contacted requested to be organized. Therefore, a village-wide meeting was specially convened on the evening of February 2nd. Nearly 2,000 people attended, which was said to be the first such meeting in Zhao Village.
    Before the meeting, the 25 Poor Peasants' Association initiators elected by the poor and hired peasants from each street first held a small meeting, and elected one person to make a public appeal at the end of the meeting to initiate the organization of the Poor Peasants' Association.
    The meeting began with a comrade from the work team clearly expressing the purpose, task and attitude of this visit to Zhao Village. It was affirmed that this time was real, not like washing their faces and wiping off the black spots. At the same time, the following matters were announced: (1) The current village cadres should still do a good job during the mass review period. They can only help with the implementation of the Land Law and are not allowed to sabotage it. They must not make any threatening or retaliatory remarks or actions against the opinions raised by the masses, whether now or in the future. Anyone who dares to retaliate and threaten boldly will be sabotaging the implementation of the Land Law, and the masses will punish him. (2) The branch will cease its work and await mass review and evaluation. Currently, all party members have only two things to do: First, honestly reflect on themselves and prepare to accept mass review; second, those who are recognized by the masses as still being party members should honestly help the masses in the process of implementing the Land Law Outline, showing whether they stand on the side of the masses and serve the masses; those who are not recognized by the masses as communist party members and are recommended by the Communist Party to be punished should also reflect on themselves, not resent the masses, and retaliate against the masses.
    Then the list of 39 party members of the branch was announced, along with the decision to suspend Jin Linyi's party membership. In the past, the Zhao Village branch had only made three party members public. This time, all were made public, and the request for mass review was a major shock to the party members and a great excitement and encouragement to the masses.
    In order to make everyone dare to review cadres and party members and dare to express opinions, it was announced: 1. Everyone should boldly raise opinions to village cadres and party members to help them reflect and transform themselves, but only to reason, not to fight. They must follow the rules and maintain order, and must not treat cadres and party members in the same way as they treated landlords in the past. If there are bad cadres with major crimes, they will be sent to the people's court for handling after being reported by everyone, and Zhao Village can also organize a people's court. 2. The ten disciplines stipulated in the "Party Member Admonition" were read again, calling on party members and cadres to humbly accept the review of the Poor Peasants' Association and the masses.
    Before the meeting, when the branch party member cadres first came to the stage, the masses thought: "They have gone to the stage again, I think it is still the same as washing their faces and wiping off the black spots, it's useless." The cadres and party members stood loosely, and the masses did not dare to get close to them and did not dare to look at them. After the meeting, the poor peasants generally reflected, "This is not afraid anymore," "Cadre retaliation will not work." After this meeting, the atmosphere in the whole village became tense.
    　　　　Rectifying the Party Among the Masses
    After thirteen days (from the evening of January 22nd to February 4th) of experience, it was proven that party rectification behind closed doors would not work. Party members must feel the pressure of the masses, and know that the masses have many and serious opinions about bad party members (many events are small things in the eyes of party member cadres, but the masses who have personally experienced them complain very indignantly), and they must reflect well in order to obtain the people's forgiveness. At the same time, before the establishment of the Poor Peasants' Association, party members of poor peasant origin must return to their own mass ranks, examine their composition, and obtain permission to join the Poor Peasants' Association before they can participate in the work of Zhao Village. The work team carefully studied this repeatedly on the evening of the 3rd and cautiously proposed a policy, namely: on the one hand, to encourage the masses to dare to give opinions to party members and cadres to educate the cadres; on the other hand, to prevent the growth of sectarian anti-party emotions and unexpected incidents of beating party members and cadres without pouring cold water. The specific steps taken were: on the 4th, work comrades went to the masses to solicit opinions, and that evening, most of the middle peasant forums were held in each street and alley, and the middle peasants' opinions on party members and cadres were preliminarily collected. On the evening of the 5th, peasant meetings were held in all five streets, with the participation of poor and middle peasants. The explanation was given in advance by the work team comrades and Poor Peasants' Association members. In the street meetings, the poor and middle peasants spoke generally enthusiastically, but some of them contained sectarian retaliatory emotions. At the end of the meeting, the work comrades sincerely invited everyone to send representatives to the branch to give opinions, and each street elected about 20 representatives, preparing to participate in the branch meeting. The conditions for selecting these people were: they spoke more, suffered more grievances, knew more things, and could represent everyone's views.
    The branch meeting was held on the morning of the 6th, and the venue was arranged by the party members themselves. The Party flag and Chairman Mao's portrait were hung in the middle, which was especially solemn and solemn. The peasant representatives from each street first gathered together, gathered their opinions, and then mobilized them before entering the venue. First, the work team made a mobilization and read the list of party members one by one to solicit opinions. The first ones raised were generally those with smaller errors. A few opinions were raised by the masses, and they could be passed. Some simply had no one raise an opinion. The opinions were concentrated on Jin Caiyuan, Yang Zhankui (village chief), Jin Suozi (Farmers' Association director), Li Wenke (public security officer), Xue Shuangsuo (political director), Jin Tongyuan (finance director) and others. After some opinions were raised, they were all temporarily put aside, and the masses were informed that they would be specially mentioned when they found time to deal with it. For example, Jin Guoquan, according to the masses, could not be finished in a day, so it was simply put aside. People with moderate errors were passed after a few opinions were raised, and some even proposed correction conditions. Party members did not make any defense on the spot, and only listened to the opinions of the masses.
    There were three types of people who were more active in the meeting: 1. Individual veterans. Because they had the ability to speak and had accumulated hatred for the village cadres, they spoke a lot, and had sectarian retaliatory and blindly anti-party emotions. A young veteran easily said that someone "did not have the qualifications to be a party member" because of personal grudges and small matters. 2. Middle peasants also spoke more generally, but they mostly started from the oppression they had suffered personally, and some things were very small. 3. A few small faction activists. Zhao xx had a small organization of four or five people, and they also spoke more. When he gave opinions on Jin Heliang, the masses pointed out that it was out of suspicion and retaliation. However, according to a post-meeting investigation, there were many honest people who rarely spoke in the past who opened their mouths today. The masses were very determined to speak. For example, Jin Weilin of the Third Street said: "If I don't talk, I will suffocate, if I talk, I will be scared to death, I will talk even if I die." However, the poor peasants did not speak very enthusiastically, which was a shortcoming.
    The comrades of the work team made a final speech, expressing their gratitude to the masses for helping the party rectification, and pointed out the following points: 1. Such a public branch meeting with the participation of the masses was unprecedented, proving that our party accepts the opinions of the masses. 2. Party members' oppression of the people, overly aggressive turning over, unclear accounts, fear of death and unwillingness to join the army, opposition to land reform, shielding landlords, mutual protection, domination, and messing around with women... are all extremely wrong. In the future, those who the people say are bad should be expelled, transferred, or punished, and it is absolutely not allowed for good and bad people to be in the same gang. 3. The people of Zhao Village still believe in the Communist Party. In the future, party members will be made public and reviewed by the people of each street and alley, and will be approved before entering the Farmers' Association. The people will definitely take back what they are afraid of. Those who are bad and do not change will be expelled and handed over to the people for handling, and we will never interfere with the freedom of the people to allow or deny party members to join the Poor Peasants' Association and the Farmers' Association. Finally, he firmly ordered the party members to never retaliate against the people. He also pointed out that all kinds of factions in the village must be broken. Among them, he especially told the retired soldiers that they had received the education of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and knew more principles, and should help the party rectification well, which was actually criticizing their sectarian retaliation.
    The opinions raised by the masses at the peasant meetings and branch meetings in each street were roughly as follows: 1. Small factions, a swarm of bees, undemocratic, oppressing the people, hanging up poor and hired peasants, arrogant attitude, not seeing the people. 2. Seizing and stealing the fruits of struggle, most cadres and activists seized good houses and good land, unfair evaluation, and excessively aggressive turning over. 3. Fear of death and unwillingness to join the army, and there were many who dared not go to the front line after deserting. 4. Corruption, extortion, fines, apportionments, and unclear accounts were even more common. The masses demanded liquidation of the accounts of the Farmers' Association, the cooperative, and the fruits of previous years. 5. Forced marriage, messing around with prostitutes. 6. Not active, not speaking up. Although they were good people, they could not do things for the people and followed the bad cadres. Some were "cannons" (talking nonsense) or thugs.
    There were about two types of people with few opinions: One type said he was good, such as Zhao Fushan (deputy village chief) who "followed the people." The other type did not assume major responsibilities and did not do major things, and did whatever people asked them to do, and did not offend the people severely.
    In short, the number and seriousness of the opinions raised by the masses far exceeded those exposed by the closed-door party rectification. The advantage of the masses sending representatives to participate in the branch meeting this time was that the masses were able to vent their anger, giving the bad cadres further pressure, making them know that it was not the superiors who wanted to rectify him, but the masses would not allow it. At the same time, the masses also saw our sincerity in reforming the party, but on the other hand, we should also be wary of the blindly anti-party emotions and the atmosphere of venting personal grievances, and carefully guide the masses to help the party rectification.
    　　　　Poor and Hired Peasant Representatives Review the First Batch of Party Members
    In order to carefully reverse the anti-party atmosphere, truly reflect the opinions of the poor and hired peasants, properly handle each party member separately, and effectively dismantle the small faction of the old branch, the Poor Peasants' Association members meetings were convened in two units on the evening of February 7. Fifteen party members who had reflected better in the branch, made smaller mistakes, and had better relations with the masses were sent to the two units separately to reflect, accept the criticism and review of the Poor Peasants' Association. The review items were the individual's family composition, mistakes, whether he was qualified to be a party member, whether he could participate in the Poor Peasants' Association or the Farmers' Association, etc.
    The meeting was chaired by the chairman elected by the Poor Peasants' Association members themselves. The comrades of the work team made some mobilization, mainly explaining: Raise as many opinions as you have on these party members, and you can say directly whether they are qualified to be party members. At the same time, it was explained that these party members had reflected relatively well in the branch. If everyone thought they could be reformed, they should be rescued with an attitude of treating illnesses and saving people. What they should withdraw, what they should change, should all be raised, and it was guaranteed that it would be done.
    The mistakes made by these fifteen people, from their own reflections, were roughly bad speaking attitude, bad labor, whoring, excessive turn-over, small acts of corruption and stealing fruit, and individual lack of firmness in the struggle against landlords. Some of them committed only one type, such as a bad attitude, while others committed more than two types, but all of them were relatively small. For these smaller mistakes, no one at this meeting generally adopted a hostile attitude or deliberately added fuel to the fire, causing resentment. This shows that the poor peasants have strong principles. For example, after Zhao Fushan (deputy village chief) reflected, someone proposed: "You must change your attitude, your speech is too rushed (crude)!" Another person continued: "I used to suffer with him for several years, and his speech was just rushed, and he was like that even when he was not a cadre." The masses said: "This can't be considered a big problem. Everything else is good, he can be a party member." Xue Sanzi (poor peasant, youth) glared his eyes when he spoke, offending many of the masses. But because the reflection was more thorough, the attitude of the masses was also: "Young people can change!" In general, the masses were disgusted by the phenomenon of glaring eyes when speaking, but as long as it was changed, it was not unforgivable. For example, when discussing Meng Nanfang (civil affairs director), everyone agreed that he could be a party member.
    But from another aspect, the masses were not just doing things sloppily, but were very serious. When Zhao Taonian reflected, he forgot to review his extra fruit and higher turn-over due to panic, and the masses immediately questioned him. He was only let go after seeing that he did not deliberately conceal it. Zhang Shulin was an accountant in the cooperative, and the masses knew that he was not in charge and would not have committed major corruption. He confessed to the small corruption, and the masses immediately asked from the aspect of "Did you know the ills of the senior cadres?" He was only let go after he replied responsibly that there was absolutely no such thing on his counter, but with the added condition: "If such a thing is found out in the future, you will be shielding him!" When Zhao Chunshan (deputy director of the military committee) reflected that he did not know anything about the past cadre problems, the masses expressed trust in this, but raised it from another aspect: "It is also wrong for you to be irresponsible for anything (not to care)!" This shows that they have a simple understanding and considerable concern for the issue of party members' political sense of responsibility, which is completely different from the mood of making sectarian issues. As a result of the review, all fifteen party members passed. After the meeting, the party members who had passed the review of the Poor Peasants' Association were happy, while those who did not pass felt depressed, "could not figure out the bottom line," and were eager to ask the party for instructions on the way out.

### 整党与民主运动密切结合　赵庄群众审查党员

　　整党与民主运动密切结合
  　赵庄群众审查党员
    【本报消息】武安九区赵庄支部有三个特点：第一是贫雇出身者占大多数，第二是从反维持、减租清债和填平补齐三次大运动中发展起来的（在最后一次发展的新党员最多），第三是一贯的结合少数积极分子代替全体群众，便形成党站在群众之上与地主富农作战，结果虽然基本上打垮了地主富农，大体在表面上做过填平补齐，可是对群众仍是一种新的独断统治。
    从这种情况出发，赵庄工作组决定双管齐下，一方面用主力访问群众发动群众（侧重在贫雇），同时却分出三个人来领导支部整顿。开始即召开支部会，讲告党员书，根据毛主席元旦讲话解释了整党精神，然后分组作自我检讨。参加者共三十五人，分为两组。根据第一遍反省所透露的情况是：
    一、成份：贫雇二十四人，中农九人，破产地主一人，尚有一人未详。
    二、错误类型及犯者人数：据他们自己反省结果，翻身过高者九人、不民主——说话气粗者九人、互相以权力关照者九人、借用公款营利者五人、掩护地富亲友财物者五人、偷取果实者七人、逛破鞋者（较严重的）三人、小偷一人、逃避参军参战者十人、当干部后劳动不力者四人、强迫婚姻者一人。（有一人兼数种者）
    三、几个错误重大的人；（１）抗勤委员靳林议：是个破产经营地主之子，幼年吃喝嫖赌荡尽家产变作流氓，减租清债时与他哥哥算帐又得回一分家产，但在去年斗争时又公然包庇他哥哥，在生活上仍然大吃大喝，在街上到处欠债，和从前无大区别，这次学习一点也不认错，已停止其党籍。（２）抗勤主任靳国全：据党员们搜集群众对他的意见数十条，说他于派做军鞋中贪污甚多，且包庇地主、派差不公，他除承认后两项外，对贪污不承认，说他有帐可稽。（３）财政主任靳同元：从前当过土匪，会开肉坊，在本村合作社肉坊工作、并任财政主任，有人说他有贪污，又在肉坊喂小份羊（自己的）喂成就卖，除他承认后者外，否认有贪污。（４）农会主任靳锁则：贫农出身，当主任不及半年，作风极不民主，遇事专横独断，不与其他农会委员商量；团结本街人包庇贪污案；特别是土地法公布以后，召开农会干部会，准备共谋交代果实时之对策，为他干部所反对。又吓唬其他党员说：“咱们现在成了政治犯，可不要相信反省的话；”又以自己之出身吓唬其他中农出身者。经其他同志提出后、他不但不接受，且马上提出发言人之其他缺点以作对抗。
    四、综合第一次反省所可看出的支部情况：（１）翻身过高与不民主带有一般性，即便是小干部小党员，也或多或少沾有此风。（２）大错误都出在大干部身上，但在人数上是少数。（３）小党员小干部互相提意见很积极，而大干部发言甚少。（４）青年人对己对人顾忌都少，改过决心也大。（５）所谈出来的材料，或为人所共知者，或为鸡毛蒜皮者，真正人所未知而较严重的错误还没有谈出来。
    在这时，党与群众之关系：因为有些大干部毛病大，小干部小党员也常站在干部立场上讲话，因而群众把他们看成一伙，甚而连一般非党员积极分子都看在内。因之，在即将准备成立贫农团的预备团员们，连一个党员也不愿介绍进去。但这些小党员小干部，在党内也是没有地位，和好的贫雇比历史、比人品，也不见得不如，在政治认识和斗争经验上还超过他们，就只因为跟着那些大干部共过些事，群众就把他们关在门外，也是工作上的大损失，须要设法扭转这种关系。而在整党工作过程中也遇到了几个问题，工作组是这样处理的：（一）干部恐慌问题：土地法公布后，有些毛病过大的干部党员感到恐慌。这种恐慌是必然的。可是这种人在这时候，偏要拖一些比较清白的或毛病较小的干部、党员跟着他跑，于是就和他们说一些要防范的话，或是说“我们好象都成了政治犯”，或是用变卖东西大吃大喝之行动来影响他们。调查到这些情况，就召集他们读告党员书和破坏土地法治罪条例，并说明以后犯了罪绝不客气，以前犯了罪如不坦白说出，今后查出来同样也要治罪。这一下起了一些作用，使他们老实了一些。（２）出路问题：因为强调制止犯罪行为，使一般党员感到无出路，好象自己跟着人家也犯了罪，因此第二次开会时，谈了一谈“只有老实改过才是出路”，内容虽仍是告党员书及毛主席元旦报告中关于整党部分，但着重点不同，便起到不同的作用。第二天又讨论了一次，情绪就稳定下来，然后就分组作自我检讨。（３）深入问题：在自我检讨中，发现有些人抱的态度仍和洗脸擦黑时候一样，以为只要一过了关，便可照常当干部，因此避开基本问题不谈，或轻描淡写，只找一些鸡毛蒜皮小事（如在果实中取了一个茶杯之类）来凑数。此时工作组谈了告农民书中的改造政权部分、告他们说：将来的各级政权都要从农代会产生，而且村政权是每年一改选，党要照党章改选支委与小组长，如果不向群众老实检讨自己的错误，不说将来当干部，农会是否有人介绍你入会还成问题，将来改造过的党根据群众的意见，还说不定能不能承认你算个党员，这样才解除了他们心理上一个动机不纯的幻想，以后好象更自觉认真一点。（４）火力问题：毛病较大的人不易接受别人的意见，有时竟提出对方错误来打击对方。对这种态度虽曾给以严厉批评，可是仍不能形成群众压力，第二天便选了些比较清白积极的人召开了个党员积极分子会议（因为积极分子未经群众审查，选择时要十分慎重，同时也不可固定的看他们），征求他们对那几个人的意见。他们在这个会上，把那几个人的基本错误指出来，说得非常有体系，并且说他们自己对那些人一向也有所畏惧，恐怕人家报复。工作组便以今后民主方向鼓励他们，才又打破了他们一些疑虑——即告他们说犯错误的人今后没有报复人的地位了。开过这个会以后，又与那些毛病大的人开检讨会，较基本的意见就更多起来。这才形成了用组织力量来整顿组织，那些不老实的人才感到真正的压力。这种压力的形成，还和领导上的坚决态度有关。工作组对抵抗的人说：愿反省可以反省，不愿意的也可以不参加，你们自己看着办。这使他们也感到较大压力。
    　　　　村民大会宣布党公开
    经过访问贫雇、初步划阶级、整党，发现了以下三个问题：（一）群众摸不清工作组的底，仍有顾虑，怕这次又与洗脸擦黑一样。（二）支部中关门整党，没有群众压力，不能解决问题，有些问题多、错误大的党员干部不反省。（三）已串连的贫雇要求组织起来。因此，在二月二日晚间专门召集了一次全村大会。到会的近二千人，据说是赵庄从来没有的一次大会。
    会前，各街贫雇农推选的二十五个贫农团发起人先开了个小会，推举一人在大会的末尾做一公开号召，发起组织贫农团。
    大会开始，首先由工作组同志把这次来赵庄的目的、任务与态度明确的作了表示。肯定的说：这一次是真的，不是象洗脸擦黑一样。同时宣布了以下几件事：（一）现任的村干部在群众审查期间仍应好好办事，对执行土地法只能帮助不准破坏，对群众所提意见，无论现在和将来，不得有任何威胁报复的言论和行动，谁要敢大胆报复和威胁，就是破坏执行土地法，群众就要治他的罪。（二）支部停止工作，听候群众审查评定。目前所有的党员，只有两件事可做：第一好好反省自己，准备接受群众的审查；第二、群众承认你还算个党员的，在执行土地法大纲过程中，要老老实实帮助群众，表明自己是否站在群众方面，为群众服务；群众不承认你是共产党员，建议共产党加以处分的，也应该反省自己，不能怨恨群众，向群众报复。
    接着就宣布了支部三十九个党员的名单，与停止靳林义党籍的决定。赵庄支部过去只公开过三个党员，这次全部公开，并请求群众审查对于党员是个很大震动，对群众又是个很大的兴奋鼓舞。
    为了使大家敢于审查干部、党员，敢于提意见，宣布：一、大家要大胆向村干部、向党员提意见，帮助他们反省，改造他们自己，但只限于说理，不准打架，必须按规矩办事，守秩序，不能象过去对待地主一样的对待干部与党员。如果有坏干部，罪过大，经大家检举后送交人民法庭去处理，赵庄也可以组织人民法庭。二、重新宣读了一遍告党员书中规定的十条纪律，号召党员、干部虚心接受贫农团与群众的审查。
    会前，支部党员干部初到台阶上来时，群众想：“人家又到台上去了，我看还和洗脸擦黑一样，不顶事”。干部党员站的地方很松动，群众不敢挨近他们，不敢看他们。会后，贫农普遍反映，“这就不怕了”，“干部报复不成了”。经过这次大会，全村空气为之紧张起来。
    　　　　在群众中整党
    经过十三天（一月二十二日晚到二月四日）的经验，证明关门整党是不行的，必须叫党员们感到群众的压力，知道群众对坏党员的意见是很多很严重的（许多事件在党员干部看来是小事，但在亲身感受的群众，则诉起苦来非常愤慨），必须好好反省，才能取得人民的宽恕。同时，在贫农团成立之前，贫农成份的党员要回到本群众队伍里去，审定成份，取得入贫农团的许可，然后才能参与赵庄村的工作。工作组三日晚对此经过反复研究，慎重提出方针，即：一方面要鼓动群众敢于给党员、干部提意见，以教育干部；一方面又要在不泼冷水的情况下，防止宗派性的反党情绪的滋长，及殴打党员干部的意外事件。具体进行的步骤是：四日，工作同志分头向群众征问意见，当晚各街各闾大都开了中农的座谈会，初步搜集了中农对党员、干部的意见。五日晚五个街都举行全街的农民大会，贫、中农都参加。事前由工作组同志及贫农团员进行解释。各街大会中，贫、中农发言均普遍热烈，但其中一部分人含有宗派报复情绪。会终，工作同志诚恳邀请大家派代表到支部去提意见，各街都选出了约二十个代表，准备参加支部大会。这些人选取的条件是：发言较多，受屈较大，了解事情较多，能代表大家发言等。
    六日上午举行支部大会，会场由党员亲自动手布置。中间挂了党旗和毛主席像，特别显得庄严肃穆。各街农民代表，先集合好，兜拢了意见，并又动员一番，才进入会场。先由工作组做了动员，宣读党员名单，一一征求意见。首先提的，大致都是错误较小的。群众提出几条，就可通过，有的简直没人提意见。意见集中在靳才垣、杨占魁（村长）、靳锁子（农会主任）、李文科（公安员）、薛双锁（政治主任）、靳同元（财政主任）等人身上。提了一些意见后，便都暂时搁过，给群众说明以后找整的时间专门提他们。如靳国全，据群众反映，一天也提不完，就根本搁过未提。中等错误的人，则提过几条之后，大家就喊通过，有的并提出改正条件。党员当场未作任何分辩，专听群众意见。
    会场发言的有三种人较为活跃：一、个别荣誉军人。因有说话能力，并对村干有积恨，所以发言很多，且有宗派报复及盲目的反党情绪。一个年青的退伍军人，则因私仇和小事，就轻易说人家“没有党员资格”。二、中农发言也较普遍，但他们多从个人所受压迫说起，有的事情很小。三、少数小派别活动者。赵××有个四五个人的小组织，他们也说话较多，他对靳河亮提意见，有群众指出是挟嫌报复。但据会后调查，平常绝少说话的老实人，今天开口了的也不少。群众发言决心是很大的，如三街靳维林说：“不谈要蹩死，谈了要吓死，就死我也要谈。”但贫农发言不很踊跃，是个缺点。
    工作组同志最后发言，对群众帮助整党，表示感谢，并指出如下几点：一、这样公开要群众参加的支部会，为前所未有，证明我党是接受群众意见的。二、党员有了压迫人民、翻身过高、帐目不清、怕死不肯参军、反对土改、包庇地主、互相包庇、霸占及乱搞女人……等，都是极不对的。以后凡老百姓说不好，就该开除的开除、该调动的调动、该处分的处分，决不允许好的坏的一伙子。三、赵庄老百姓还相信共产党，今后党员公开，交各街各闾老百姓审查，批准后进农会，老百姓害怕的一定收回。坏而不改的，开除交人民处理，我们决不干涉老百姓允许或否决党员入贫农团及农会的自由。最后并坚决命令党员，永远不许向老百姓报复。对村中各种宗派，亦指出必须打破。其中特别对荣退军人，说他们是受过共产党八路军教育的，懂的道理更多，要好好帮助整党，实际是批评了他们的宗派报复。
    各街农民大会及支部大会上群众所提意见，大概有如下几种：一、小宗派，一窝蜂，不民主，欺压人民，吊打贫雇，态度横暴，看不见老百姓。二、多占及偷窃斗争果实，大多数干部积极分子强占好房好地，评议不公，翻身过高。三、怕死不肯参军，开小差后不敢上前线者为数甚多。四、贪污、勒索、罚款、摊派、帐目不清，更是普遍现象。对农会、合作社及历年果实帐目，群众要求清算。五、强迫婚姻，胡搞破鞋。六、不积极，不吭气。虽为好人，而不能给人民办事，跟着坏干部跑。有些则是“炮”（乱说话）或打手。
    对意见少的人约有二类：一种是说他好，如赵福山（副村长）是“跟着老百姓跑的”。再一种是未负重大责任，未办大事，人家叫干啥就干啥，对老百姓得罪得不厉害。
    总之群众所提意见之多及其严重性，远超过关门整党所暴露者，这次群众派代表参加支部大会的好处，是让群众出够了气，给坏干部以进一步压力，使他们知道并不是上级要整他，而是群众不让，同时，群众也看出了我们改造党的诚意，但另一面也很应该警惕盲目的反党情绪与泄私愤的空气，慎重诱导群众帮助整党。
    　　　　贫雇代表审查第一批党员
    为着慎重的扭转反党空气，真正反映贫雇农意见，分别的正确处理各个党员，并有效的拆散旧支部这个小宗派，于二月七日晚间分两个单位召集贫农团员会议，把在支部中反省较好、错误较小、与群众关系也较好的十五个党员，分别送到两个单位进行反省，接受贫农团的批评与审查。审查的项目是各人的家庭成份、错误、够不够党员、能不能参加贫农团或农会等。
    这会议由贫农团团员自己选主席主持，工作组同志进行了一些动员，主要说明：对这几个党员有什么意见尽量提，够不够党员完全可以以直说。同时说明这些党员在支部反省还比较好，如果大家认为他们可以改造，就以治病救人态度来挽救他们，他们该退什么，该改什么，都提出来，保证做到。
    这十五个人犯的错误，从他们自己的反省看，大体是说话态度不好，劳动不好，嫖女人，翻身较高，小的贪污与偷窃果实行为，个别的对地主斗争不坚决等。其中有的人只犯了一种，如态度坏，有的犯到两种以上，但都犯的较小。对于这些较小的错误，这个会议上一般没有人采取敌对的态度，或故意加油添醋，激起反感的现象，这说明贫农的原则性强。比如，赵福山（副村长）反省后，有人提出：“你的态度可得改一改哩，说话就冲（碰）！”另一个人接着说：“我以前和他在一块给人家受过好几年，他说话就是好冲，不当干部也是那样子。”群众说：“这不能算大病。别的都好，可以当个党员。”薛三子（贫农、青年）一说话就瞪眼，得罪群众很多。但因反省较彻底，群众的态度也是：“年青年人，改过就行！”一般看，群众对这种说话蹬眼的现象是有反感的，但只要改，还不是不能原谅。比如，讨论孟南方（民事主任）时，大家同意他做党员。
    但从另方面看，群众也不是马马虎虎完事的态度，而是很认真的。赵桃年反省时由于慌张，忘记检讨自己多得果实、翻身高的事情，群众就马上提出质问。以后看到他并不是有意掩饰，才放过去。张树林在合作社当会计，群众知道他不大当家，不致有大贪污，小的贪污自己说了，群众即从“你知不知道大干部的弊病”方面提出，他负责答复了在他这个柜上绝没这种情事以后，才放过去，但有附加条件：“以后如果查出这种事情，你就是包庇！”赵春山（武委会副主任）反省他对过去干部问题什么也不知道时，群众对这点表示信任，但却从另方面提出：“你这对任啥事不负责任（不管）也不对呀！”这表现他们对党员的政治责任心问题有着朴素的理解与相当的关心，这和闹宗派的情绪是完全不同的。审查结果，十五个党员都通过了。会后，已经过贫农团审查够格的党员表现高兴，未通过的则感到苦闷，“摸不着底”，而急于向党请求指示出路。
