    Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 15th: The people of Xuchang City joyfully celebrated their first Lunar New Year after liberation. At the beginning of the year, the democratic municipal government sent representatives to extend New Year greetings to residents and shops on various streets. Many citizens grabbed our staff members' hands, insisting they stay for a drink and a chat. Grandma Xu from Pingding Street took off her tattered old clothes and put on a brand-new padded jacket, saying with joy, "In past years, the rich celebrated the New Year, but the poor struggled to survive. This year, we poor people have food and clothing for the New Year!" The Hui people of Yinlong Street, who never used to beat drums or set off firecrackers, exceptionally celebrated the Spring Festival with great joy, setting off firecrackers and beating drums to pay New Year respects to the municipal government. Citizens from various streets, in groups and with gongs and drums, paid New Year respects to the municipal government and various agencies. Everyone bowed respectfully to Chairman Mao's portrait. The book and photo exhibition on South Street was visited by an endless stream of people, and the "Xuchang Briefing" also published a special edition on that day.

    往年穷人到处躲债
    今年穷人有吃有穿
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十五日电】许昌市人民欢度解放后第一个旧历新年，民主市政府于年初派代表向各街居民、商店贺年，许多市民拉着我工作人员的手，定要留下喝两杯酒谈心。平定街许老太太脱下多年破烂的薄衣，换上崭新的棉袄，喜气洋洋地说：“往年是富过年，穷过关，今年咱穷人过年有吃有穿”。引龙街的回民，从不敲锣放炮，春节亦破例兴高采烈放爆竹，敲锣鼓到市政府拜年。各街市民成群结队，锣鼓喧天，到市政府及各机关拜年。人人都亲热的对毛主席像鞠躬礼拜，南大街图书照片展览会参观者络绎不绝，“许昌简报”于是日亦出特刊。
