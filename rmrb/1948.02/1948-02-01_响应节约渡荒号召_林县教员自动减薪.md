    Responding to the Call for Thrift to Overcome the Famine
    Lin County Teachers Voluntarily Reduce Salaries
    [Lin County News] Lin County primary school teachers, responding to the call from higher authorities to promote production and thrift to overcome the famine, reduce the people's burden, and support the front lines, have launched a conscious salary reduction movement. According to incomplete statistics: teachers in the Second District have voluntarily reduced their salaries by 745 jin of millet. The Third District reduced 550 jin. The Fourth District reduced 380 jin. The Seventh District reduced 680 jin. The Eighth District reduced 420 jin. The Tenth District reduced 851 jin. A total of 3,634 jin of millet. In this movement, many model teachers who serve the masses have emerged. For example, Comrade Wei Yaosheng of the Second District took out 60 jin of rice to buy cotton and stationery for poor children, greatly strengthening the relationship between the masses and the teachers.
