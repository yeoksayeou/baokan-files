Statement Regarding Broadcasting Letters to Military Dependents

　　The station has recently received many letters from military dependents without military unit numbers (some are for locating people) or with unclear numbers. We are unable to broadcast these letters and have returned them. This is because broadcasting letters requires us to first inform the intended recipients of which unit they belong to, so that radio listeners in that unit can prepare to record the message and then pass it on to the intended recipient. Without the military unit number, this is difficult to do. Therefore, we would like to remind all military dependents to clearly write the recipient's current military unit number (e.g.,某纵部 [某 zong bu], 某旅 [mou lü], 某团 [mou tuan], 某营 [mou ying], 某连 [mou lian]) and name (write clearly). In addition, the station has also received letters from comrades in units (or organizations) to their families. We are also unable to broadcast these letters and have returned them, as they will not be received even if broadcast. Finally, we would like to remind all post offices: This station only broadcasts letters from military dependents of the southbound counter-offensive army where postal routes are blocked. If postal service is already available, especially for letters to a certain unit or organization within the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, please deliver them by mail and do not forward them to this station.

　　关于播送军属家信的声明
    本台最近收到很多没有部队番号（有些是寻人的）或番号不明的军属家信，这些信，本台无法播送，都退回了。因为广播信件也要事先告诉是给那一部分，什么人的，好让那个部分的收音员准备记录下来，再转告收信人本人，如果没有部队番号，就不好办。因此再请各位军属们注意：写信时一定要写明收信人现在的部队番号（某纵部、某旅、某团、某营、某连）和姓名（字要写真）。另外本台还收到一些部队（或机关）同志写给家里的信。这些信本台也无法播送退回了，因为即使播了，也收不到。最后还请各邮局注意：本台只播送邮路不通的南下反攻大军的军属家信，如果已经通邮的地区特别是给晋冀鲁豫解放区以内某部队或机关的军属信件，还是请你们邮递，不要再转给本台。
