Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing: The vast majority of Nanjing citizens are ignoring the Chiang Kai-shek bandits’ sham "Legislative Yuan" election. The sham election, which lasted three days, ended on the 23rd. In the city's second "election district," although 8,000 "electors" were originally registered, less than one-fifth participated in the sham election, and the same was true for the third "election district." At the polling station in the "election district" of Central University, there were very few voters, and the ballot box was practically empty. A satirical advertisement posted on the wall of the university dormitory read: "Ballots for sale, three bowls of rice and two packs of cigarettes per ballot." Merchants were also unwilling to participate in the voting; the ballot box of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was "completely empty." Chiang Kai-shek bandit officials in charge of the sham election tried to persuade passers-by to vote, but few people paid attention to them. The main participants in the voting were Chiang Kai-shek government officials and soldiers. Many ballots were pre-filled with the names of "candidates," and some were even filled out in batches. In many "election districts," there were so many Chiang Kai-shek bandit officials, "election supervisors," police, and journalists that the scattered "electors" were drowned out.

    南京蒋匪扮演伪选  市民不理他那一套
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据塔斯社南京消息：南京市民绝大多数不理睬蒋匪的“立委”伪选。该伪选历时三日，已于二十三日结束。该市第二“选举区”，原登记了八千名“选举人”，但参加伪选者不及五分之一，第三“选举区”也是一样。中央大学“选举区”的投票处，投票者寥寥，票箱实际上在那里空放着，该校宿舍墙上贴着讽刺广告说：“选票出卖，三碗饭和两包烟一张。”商人们也不愿参加投票，市商会的票箱“空空如也”。负责主持伪选的蒋匪官员劝说过路人进去投票，但很少有人理他们。参加投票的主要是蒋匪政府官员和军人。有许多选票是预先填好了“被选举人”的，甚至有些是整批填好了的。在许多“选举区”里，蒋匪官员、“选举监督员”、警察和新闻记者是那样多，以致把零零落落的“选举人”都湮没了。
