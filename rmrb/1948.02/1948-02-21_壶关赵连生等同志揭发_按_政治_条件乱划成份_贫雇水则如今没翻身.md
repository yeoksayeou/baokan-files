　　Huguan Comrades Zhao Liansheng and others expose
　　Class status was arbitrarily assigned based on "political" conditions, and poor hired laborers have not yet been liberated
    [Taihang News]: Zhao Liansheng and Gao Song, two comrades from the Huguan County government, wrote to the Taihang Xinhua Daily on the 13th of this month, exposing how cadres in Huangjiachuan "incorrectly designated class status" to oppress poor hired laborers, preventing them from turning over a new leaf. They proposed that all localities pay attention to investigating this serious problem. The letter stated: In Huangjiachuan, Second District of our county, the hired laborers who were originally shepherds are still treated as "degraded middle peasants" by the cadres. On January 20th, when inspecting the difficulties faced by the poor hired laborers in the village, it was discovered that three households, including Shui Ze, De Xi, and Bao Ze, had not had quilts to cover themselves throughout the winter. In particular, Niu Baoze had worked as a long-term laborer outside for fifty years. After these years of struggling for liberation, his family still had nothing, and the clothes he wore were the most ragged. At that time, he only had one dou of grain left. After writing about the above situation in the county's small newspaper, the political director of Huangjiachuan went to the female village head Haitang angrily and said: "Let's remove ourselves from our positions! It's okay to say that Baoze and Dexi are poor hired laborers and haven't been taken care of, but Shui Ze is a degraded middle peasant, we can't take care of him!?" Other cadres also talked nonsense like this. Later, after we carefully interviewed the village head, she said: "Shui Ze started herding sheep at the age of eight, and his family was very poor. During the rent reduction movement, because he was not 'aware' and was too close to his landlord, Shui Ze was struggled against and beaten once. Is that why he was classified as a degraded middle peasant!?" As a result of this misclassification, Shui Ze has not been able to turn over a new leaf in several movements of "land to the tiller," and now he doesn't even have a room and is often bullied. This winter, throughout two to three months of winter production, he had no way to overcome the difficulties, and the cadres did not provide any solutions. We believe that it is unreasonable for poor hired laborers to have been oppressed in the past and still not be able to turn over a new leaf, suffering on both ends, and this should be corrected immediately. The reasons why some village cadres are acting so recklessly should also be investigated and studied. We think that similar situations may exist elsewhere, and the leadership should carefully investigate.

　　壶关赵连生等同志揭发
　　按"政治"条件乱划成份  贫雇水则如今没翻身
    【太行消息】：壶关县政府赵连生，高嵩两同志，本月十三日给太行新华日报写信，揭发黄家川干部"错划成份"来压迫雇贫水则翻不了身，提议各地注意检查这一严重问题。来信说：我县二区黄家川羊工出身的雇贫水则，至今干部仍以"降中农"苛待。上月二十日，检查该村雇贫困难，当时发现水则、得喜、保则等三户，冬天一直没有棉被盖。特别是牛保则，在外住了五十年长工，经过这几年闹翻身，家里还是啥也没有，穿的衣服最破烂，当时已只剩一斗粮。把上述事情写到县小报后，黄家川的政治主任即去找女村长海棠生气的说："咱自己撤职了咱自己吧！保则、得喜是贫雇，说没照顾到还可以，水则是个降中，咱不能照顾呀！？"其它干部竟也这样瞎说。后来，据我们仔细访问了村长，她说："水则从八岁上就放羊，家里很贫苦。减租运动时，因他不'觉悟'，好给他东家（地主）接近，结果就把水则斗了一次，打了一顿。就这便划成他降中农啦！？"这么错划的结果，使水则在耕者有其田好几次运动中，一直没翻身，现在连间房也没有，并经常受气。今冬整整两三个月的冬季生产中，困难没办法，干部也没给解决。我们认为：贫雇过去受压迫，现在还不能翻身，两头受苦，很不合理，应马上纠正。有些村干部为什么这样胡作非为，也应该考察研究。我们想：别处恐也有类似这样情形，领导上应仔细检查。
