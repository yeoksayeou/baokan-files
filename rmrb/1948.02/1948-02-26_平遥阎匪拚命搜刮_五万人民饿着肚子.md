[Taiyue News] In Pingyao, under the Yan bandit's brutal铡刀政策 (guillotine policy) and the looting of the "Struggle Corps" and village offices, a major famine has been created. In Zhu Kang Village, Third District, the family of Pei Lao Wu had seven members. Last autumn, they harvested six shi of rice, which, along with the wheat harvested in the summer, was all seized by the enemy, and by November they had nothing to eat. This was considered a relatively well-off middle peasant household. In the whole of Zhu Kang Village, which has more than 140 households, 74 households had nothing to eat by last November. They were living on hemp bran cakes, chaff, and corn stalks. According to January statistics, only 20 households could afford to eat the summer harvest. Of the 21 qing of wheat fields in the village, which could produce 700 shi of wheat, the Yan bandits seized more than 400 shi. There are more than 120 villages like this in the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts of Pingyao, with a population of 50,000, accounting for more than one-third of the total population of Pingyao. In January, seven people starved to death in Longzhuang and Guoxiu villages in the Third District; two people starved to death in Nan Yijian in the Second District; and five people starved to death in five villages in the Fourth District. Villager Lei Liangjian, because his grain was looted by the enemy and he had nothing to eat, dug his own grave and died. Li Fugua had nothing to eat and died after drinking apricot kernel water. There are quite a few suicides like this. The masses who fled to Xujiazhuang in our district cried to the democratic government personnel as soon as they saw them, saying: "If we wait a few more days, more people will flee from our village, and even more people will starve to death." Now, in Pingyao, more than 10,000 refugees have fled to our Yuebei region. The Pingyao Military Affairs Committee and the democratic government are now trying to raise grain and bran to provide relief, and are organizing the masses to engage in production, overcome difficulties, and launch struggles against the enemy.

　　平遥阎匪拚命搜刮  五万人民饿着肚子
    【太岳消息】平遥在阎匪惨酷的铡刀政策和奋斗团乡公所抢掠下，造成了大灾荒。三区朱抗村裴老五家有七口人，去年秋天打了六石米，连同夏天收下的麦子，都被敌人抢走了，十一月已没吃的。这还是一户比较好的中农。朱抗全村一百四十多户，去年十一月就有七十四户没吃的。吃麻生饼、糠、玉茭秆过日子。一月统计，只有二十户人家能吃到夏收。该村二十一顷麦地，能产麦子七百石，阎匪就抢了四百多石。象这样的村子，在平遥二、三、四、五区就有一百二十多个，人数有五万人，占平遥全部人口三分之一还多。一月份三区龙庄、郭休等村，饿死七人；二区南依涧饿死二人；四区五村饿死五人。村民雷亮兼因粮食被敌抢光没吃的，自掘坟墓而死了。李伏瓜无吃的，喝上杏仁水死了。象这样自杀的还很不少。逃到我区许家庄的群众，一见民主政府人员就哭着说：“再等几天我村逃出的就更多，饿死的人也要更多。”现在平遥，逃上我岳北来的难民已有一万多人，平遥武委会与民主政府，现在设法募集粮糠救济，并组织群众生产，克服困难，开展对敌斗争。
