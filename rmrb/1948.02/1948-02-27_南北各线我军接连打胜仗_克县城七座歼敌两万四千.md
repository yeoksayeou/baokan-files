　　Battle Situation for the Week of the 19th to the 25th: In the past week, good news has been frequently reported from the Liberated Army on the northern and southern fronts. Seven cities have been captured in succession, and more than 24,000 enemy troops have been eliminated.

　　On the Northeast front, on the 19th alone, the Liberated Army captured the two poles of the Shenyang outer defense system - "Steel City" Anshan and Faku. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 20,000 enemies were wiped out in the two places, including the entire 25th Division of the 52nd Army, the entire Provisional 62nd Division of the U.S.-equipped New 6th Army, and a part of the traffic police and mine police. Dozens of enemy officers above the rank of colonel, including deputy division commanders and regimental and battalion commanders, were captured. Now the Liberated Army has cut off the retreat of the Chiang bandit in Shenyang from the south, making the Chiang bandit's precarious nest in Shenyang even more isolated. At present, only a few isolated points remain on the periphery of Shenyang, including Fushun in the east, Tieling in the north, Xinmin in the west, and Benxi in the southeast. The Wei Lihuang and Chiang bandit troops have been trapped in this area of ​​no more than a hundred li and are facing the fate of annihilation. Under the Liberated Army's thunderous offensive, the dying Chiang bandit was completely devoid of humanity and used poison gas bombs in the battle of Shifosi. The spokesperson of the Northeast Liberated Army Command has issued a serious warning. If the Chiang bandit continues such atrocities, the Liberated Army will be forced to take resolute revenge. At the same time, in the wake of the Chiang bandit's disastrous defeat in the Northeast, it has recently attempted to use a group of old Northeast warlord bureaucrats to help support the precarious situation. Obviously, the result will only be to add a few more burial objects to the Northeast Chiang bandit. All these have shown that the Northeast Chiang bandit has reached a dead end.

　　On the Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui fronts, the Liberated Army and the local armed forces of Ji, Lu, and Yu captured the two county towns of Lanfeng and Minquan on the Longhai Line again on the 18th and 19th. In the Lanfeng battle, the headquarters of the 119th Brigade of the Chiang Bandit's 68th Division and all of its 356th Regiment were wiped out, and a total of more than 1,600 people, including the pseudo-county magistrate of Lanfeng, were captured. On the 19th, our army intercepted the enemy fleeing from Kaocheng to Kaifeng and captured more than 100 of them. On the same day, the local armed forces of Yu, Anhui, and Su captured Zhecheng again, annihilating more than 500 enemy troops. The local armed forces in various sub-districts actively eliminated local Chiang bandits in the areas of Woyang, Fuyang, Huaiyang, Tongxu, and Chenliu. From the end of last month to the beginning of this month, more than 600 of them have been wiped out.

　　On the Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei fronts, our military region troops and local armed forces attacked the enemy everywhere. The troops of the Jianghan Military Region captured the two cities of Yingshan and Anlu on the 15th and 17th respectively, capturing more than 500 enemy troops below the rank of battalion commander. The troops of the Western Anhui Military Region ambushed the enemy harassing the area in Qingcaoge and Guachehe, southwest of Tongcheng, on the 8th, killing more than 200 of them. Since the 8th, the local armed forces of the 3rd and 5th sub-districts of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei have wiped out more than 1,000 local Chiang bandits in the areas of Luanchuan, Yiyang, and Songxian.

　　On the East China front, the local armed forces of Central China advanced into the Chiang bandit-occupied areas to fight in the first ten days of this month and smashed the Chiang bandit's partial "mopping-up" operations in Huaibei, capturing more than ten strongholds, including Yantou, two li north of Taixing, and the Xinyi Harbor, Xieqiao, and Beifurong west of Xinghua, and eliminating 1,700 enemy troops. Our local armed forces in Jiaodong are active in the suburbs of the enemy's isolated strongholds of Yantai and Longkou. On the 7th and 8th, they destroyed the pseudo-organizations in 17 villages on the periphery of Yantai City and surrounded Longkou on three sides.

　　The Northwest Liberated Army has formally established a sub-district in the Huanglong Mountain area, forming a pincer attack on the Hu bandits together with the increasingly expanding Guanzhong sub-district, and becoming a powerful forward position for liberating the Great Northwest.

　　南北各线我军接连打胜仗  克县城七座歼敌两万四千
    十九日至二十五日一周战况：一周来南北各线解放军频传捷音，连克城市七座，歼敌两万四千余名。
    东北方面，十九日一天内解放军攻占了沈阳外围防御体系的两极——“钢都”鞍山和法库两城。据初步统计两地共歼灭敌五十二军廿五师全部，美械装备的新六军暂六十二师全部及交警矿警各一部，共两万余，俘敌正副师长团营长等校级以上军官数十名。现解放军已从南面截断沈阳蒋匪后路，使蒋匪危巢沈阳更加孤立。目前沈阳外围只剩下东面的抚顺、北面的铁岭、西面的新民和东南的本溪等几个孤点，卫匪立煌及蒋匪军已被困在这方圆不出百余里的地区，面临覆灭的命运。在解放军雷霆万钧的攻势下，垂死的蒋匪竟绝灭人性，在石佛寺战斗中，使用毒气弹，东北解放军司令部发言人已提出严重警告，如蒋匪继续此等暴行，解放军将被迫作坚决报复。同时蒋匪在东北惨败之余，最近企图起用一撮东北老军阀官僚，想以这些人物来帮助撑持危局，显然其结果不过是多添几个东北蒋匪的陪葬者而已。所有这些都已说明东北蒋匪已到了走头无路的绝境。
    苏鲁豫皖方面，解放军及冀鲁豫地方武装十八、十九两日再克陇海线上的兰封及民权两县城。兰封一役，歼灭蒋匪六十八师一一九旅旅部及该旅之三五六团全部，歼俘兰封伪县长等共一千六百余名。十九日我军又截击自考城向开封逃窜之敌，俘其百余名。同日豫皖苏地方武装再克柘城，歼守敌五百余名。各分区地方武装在涡阳、阜阳、淮阳、通许、陈留一带，积极清剿土蒋。自上月底至本月初，先后歼其六百余名。
    鄂豫皖及豫陕鄂方面，我军区部队及地方武装到处击敌。江汉军区部队十五、十七两日连克应山、安陆两城，生俘敌大队长以下五百余名。皖西军区我军于八日在桐城西南之青草塥及挂车河伏击出扰之敌，毙其二百余名。豫陕鄂三、五分区地武自八日以来，先后在滦川、伊阳、嵩县地区歼土蒋一千余名。
    华东方面，华中地方武装本月上旬挺进蒋匪侵占区作战，并粉碎蒋匪对淮北的局部“扫荡”，攻克泰兴城北二里的燕头及靖江的新港、斜桥、兴化西的北芙蓉等十余据点，歼敌一千七百余名。胶东我地方武装活跃于敌孤立据点烟台与龙口近郊，七、八两日摧毁烟市外围十七个村伪组织，并三面包围龙口。
    西北解放军已在黄龙山地区正式成立分区，与日益扩大的关中分区形成对胡匪夹击的两钳，并成为解放大西北的有力前进阵地。　　　（新华社）
