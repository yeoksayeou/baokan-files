Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 17th: Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shanghai continue to cruelly persecute students in various schools. According to incomplete figures from Shanghai newspapers cited by foreign news agencies on the 13th, after the Tongji University bloodbath, Chiang Kai-shek bandits have already forced various universities to expel 217 students. Tongji University alone expelled 127 students, of whom more than 40 were then subjected to imprisonment and "interrogation" by Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Several arrested students, in the severe cold of winter, were stripped of their clothes by Chiang Kai-shek bandits and thrown into cement prisons, one of whom has now died. Among the arrested students from St. John's University, two were released but then re-arrested by Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Comprehensive news: The situation of hunger and lack of education among students in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas is becoming increasingly serious. At Tianjin's Nankai University, before the Lunar New Year in December, the monthly food expenses for students were 550,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency for type A meals and 450,000 for type B. By January of this year, type A had increased to 1.2 million per month, and type B to 900,000. In just one month, the price doubled. During the winter vacation, more than 500 students remained at the school. The dining hall planned to start providing meals from January 15th, but by the 13th, the funds for meals were still not secured. Students universally felt the threat of hunger, and bulletin boards were filled with advertisements for selling clothes. At Tangshan Institute of Technology, food expenses in January had already risen to 1.2 million. Many students could not afford meals. In Taiyuan, where Yan Xishan bandits are entrenched, the price of millet reached over 4 million Chiang Kai-shek currency per stone in mid-January. Students could not maintain their livelihoods and began to withdraw from school and drop out from December of the previous year.

With soaring prices, private universities and middle and primary schools in various Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas have increased tuition fees for the next semester. In Guangzhou, tuition fees at private universities are as high as 5.12 million, and junior high schools also require 3.2 million. At Yenching University in Beiping, tuition and miscellaneous fees for the next semester are 4.5 million, and other private institutions will all start at at least one million. Many private middle schools in Tianjin are unable to maintain operations due to financial difficulties and plan to merge to form Xiehe Middle School, with fees between 1.05 million and 2 million. Private primary schools charge around one million. Chiang Kai-shek area newspapers report that ordinary middle-class families can no longer afford to send their children to school and predict that after the winter vacation, a large number of students in Chiang Kai-shek areas will drop out of school.

  　开除、逮捕、坐牢、冻死
    【新华社陕北十七日电】上海蒋匪继续残酷迫害各校学生。据外国通讯社十三日引沪报不完整数字，同济大学血案发生后，蒋匪已迫令各大学开除学生二百十七人，仅同济一校即开除一百二十七人，其中四十余人复横遭蒋匪监禁及“审讯”。若干被捕学生在冬天严寒中，被蒋匪剥去衣服，投入水门汀牢狱中，现已死去一人。圣约翰被捕学生中，两人被释放后复遭将匪再度逮捕。
    【新华社陕北十六区日电】综合消息：蒋管区学生饥饿、失学情况日趋严重。天津南开大学年前十二月学生甲种膳食费每月蒋币五十五万元，乙种四十五万元，至今年一月甲种增至每月一百廿万元，乙种九十万元，仅隔一月即暴涨一倍。该校寒假中五百余学生留校，膳团拟于一月十五日起伙，但至十三日膳费仍无着落，学生普遍感受饥饿威胁，布告栏中贴满出卖衣服的广告。唐山工学院一月份膳食已涨至一百二十万元，许多学生开不起伙食。阎匪盘踞下的太原，一月中旬小米每石达四百余万元，学生无法维持生活，从年前十二月份起纷纷退学辍业。
    在物价高涨下，蒋区各地私立大中小学下学期纷纷增加学费。广州各私立大学收费高达五百十二万元，初中亦需三百二十万元。北平燕京大学下学期学杂费四百五十万，其他各私立院校均将以百万起码。天津许多私立中学因经费困难无法维持，拟合并成立协合中学，收费在一百零五万至二百万之间；私立小学收费均在百万上下。蒋区报纸报导：一般中等家庭已无法负担其子弟就学，并预料寒假过后，蒋区各地学生将大量失学。
