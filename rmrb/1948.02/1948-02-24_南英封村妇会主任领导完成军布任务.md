　　Nan Yingfeng Village Women's Association Director Leads Completion of Military Cloth Task
    [Wei County News] The Director of the Women's Association of Nan Yingfeng Village, Third District, Wei County, was very active and responsible in the task of organizing military cloth weaving this time. The Women's Association Director's son was a battalion commander in the Field Army. He died in the Yangshan battle. When they brought his body back, they received a notice to collect flower cloth for military use. The Women's Association Director said: "Let's delay the funeral for two days. He's already dead anyway, delaying the funeral for two days doesn't matter, weaving military cloth is more important. The soldiers at the front are freezing and suffering, we must let them all be warm." At that time, she called together the Women's Association group leaders to discuss the weaving method, and personally took the lead, working day and night. The cotton she received was not good, and the weather was very bad, making it difficult to starch well, so she handed in the flowers she had weighed as cloth. Only after completing the weaving work did she bury her son. Everyone praised her active and responsible spirit.

　　南英封村妇会主任领导完成军布任务
    【魏县消息】魏县三区南英封村妇会主任，这次布置织军布，工作积极负责。妇会主任的儿子，在野战军部队当营长，打杨山战斗牺牲，把尸首起回来，当日接到通知叫领花织军布。妇会主任说：晚两天再殡葬吧，反正死了，晚殡葬两天不要紧，织军布事要紧。前方战士冻着困难，要让他们都穿得暖暖和和的。当时召集妇会组长讨论织布办法，并亲自带头干，昼夜奔忙。所领的棉花不好，天气很孬，也不容易浆好，便把自己秤的花按成布交上。完成织布工作，才殡葬他儿。她这种积极负责精神，人人说好。
