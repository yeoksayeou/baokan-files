(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th) According to reports from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: Labor strikes have broken out in Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places around the Lunar New Year. In Shanghai, employees in the fashion industry, due to unmet demands for year-end bonuses, began a work slowdown on the 16th of last month, with all employees in the industry along Avenue Joffre participating. Two hundred employees of the Jianghai Customs also went on strike again on the morning of the 26th of last month, resolutely demanding improved treatment and the issuance of cold-weather clothing allowances and year-end bonuses. More than two hundred male and female workers at the Zhanghua Woolen Mill in Pudong, demanding that the factory issue year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' salary, protested with a hunger strike starting on the 15th of last month after the factory only agreed to pay half. Labor disputes have also occurred at the Xingye, Huadong, and Zhonglu Match Factories, as well as the Taifeng and Jianhua Dyeing and Weaving Factories in Qingdao. At the end of last month, more than one hundred workers from the Jilu Knitting Factory protested to the Chiang bandit Social Bureau after the factory unreasonably dismissed technician Wang Xiaode, demanding reinstatement. The workers persisted at the Chiang bandit municipal government and social bureau for three days and two nights. The Chiang bandit municipal government forcibly transported the workers back to the factory by car, but the workers returned again. The Chiang bandit municipal government then ordered military police to illegally arrest all the workers' representatives. In mid-month, the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau's Public Tram and Automobile Management Office unreasonably dismissed 190 employees, causing strong protests from the workers there, who simultaneously made demands to the office for year-end bonuses and improved living conditions.

    上海青岛很多工人罢工
    要求改善生活
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：上海青岛等年关工潮迭出。沪时装业职工因要求年赏未遂，上月十六日起霞飞路一带该业全体职工举行怠工。江海关职工二百人亦于上月二十六日晨起再度罢工，职工均坚决要求改善待遇，发给寒衣费和年赏。浦东章华毛织厂二百余男女工人，因要求厂方发给二个月薪金之年赏，而厂方只允给半数，乃有上月十五日起绝食抗议。青岛兴业、华东、中鲁三火柴厂及泰丰、建华两染织厂亦发生劳资纠纷。上月底，冀鲁针织厂工人一百余人又因该厂技工王孝德被厂方无理解雇，结队向蒋匪社会局抗议，要求予以复工。工人在蒋匪市府及社会局坚持三日两夜不去，蒋匪市府竟将工人用汽车强运回厂，工人旋又返回，蒋匪市府竟令军警将工人代表全部非法捕去。天津公用局公共电车、汽车管理处上月中旬无理解雇职工一百九十余人，引起该处工人激烈抗议，工人等并同时向处方提出年赏及改善生活要求。
