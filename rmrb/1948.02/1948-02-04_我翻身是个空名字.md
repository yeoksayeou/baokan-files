    My Emancipation is Just an Empty Name
    Chai Renping
    The day before yesterday, I met Wang Sanni's mother in Wu'an Wuji Town. She complained to me for a long time:
    When my old man was young, he tilled land for others on a sharecropping basis. Later, he managed to acquire ten or so mu of land. Because we had many children, we couldn't support them all, so three of them went to Guan Dong to apprentice in business. Only the old man and I, and our two daughters-in-law, were left. Although times were bad, we could barely manage to drink thin porridge if we worked hard. But alas, the poor folks ran into a leap year, suffering two years of drought in a row. The old man starved to death, and our whole family was scattered, the family broken and the people dead. At that time, the "old days" were still in China, the roads were difficult, and the children couldn't return. The two daughters-in-law also ran away from hunger, and haven't returned to this day. Of our whole family of eight, only I am left. My emancipation is just an empty name. In July of this year, everyone else had already distributed the fruits of their labor several times. I asked my neighbors why they didn't call me to distribute the fruits. The neighbors said, "You're not in the farmers' association, so you can't get approval." I said, "Why don't you let me join the farmers' association?" The neighbors said, "The cadres think you're backward." I went to look for the political director, Yang Yusuo, and after running around several times, he finally let me join the farmers' association. They distributed to me a table, a water tank, a broken box, ten catties of cotton, a suit of clothes, and some scraps of cloth. But I still have no rice to eat. I can only rely on washing clothes and doing odd jobs for others to get a few catties of rice to drink, making a pot of thin porridge that I drink for several meals. "In the summer, there was still cotton to spin, but now there isn't even a bit of cotton fluff. In the summer, I earned four thousand yuan, all of which I put into the cooperative, hoping to get a share of the profits in the twelfth lunar month, to buy some rice, and eat two good meals during the New Year. I also have to return the two thousand yuan I borrowed from my younger sister. Who knew that the cooperative's treasurer wouldn't let me get my share. He said that there was an order from above, fearing waste, and that there would be no profit sharing this year. It will only be shared in February next year. This is killing the poor folks. Never mind eating well during the New Year, I can't even get enough rice." She stopped there. I looked up and saw tears in her eyes. I immediately comforted her, saying, "Old lady, don't cry. Didn't you hear the reading of the Outline Land Law in the farmers' association? Now we're going to thoroughly redistribute the land. Everyone will get a share of land and property. Poor households like yours will not only get a share but will also be specially cared for!" She sighed and said, "Chairman Mao's method is really good, but the cadres in our village just don't do it properly. The more people who are capable, eloquent, and good at talking, the more they can get. But those poor families like mine, who are more and more without anyone to rely on, can't get anything..."
    There must be more than just Wang Sanni's mother who have an empty name of emancipation. I hope comrades in all regions will pay close attention to their difficulties and demands.

    我翻身是个空名字
    柴任平
    前天，我在武安午汲镇遇过见王三妮娘，她向我诉了半天苦：
    我老汉年青时给人家种分收地，后来才置了十来亩地，因为孩子们多，养育不住，三个孩子都跑到关东去学生意。只留下俺老两口，和两个媳妇子。虽然时光不好，紧刨找还能喝两顿稀饭，可好，穷汉子赶上闰月年，连遭二年荒旱，老汉一饿死，俺全家就五零四散，家破人亡了，那时“老日子”还在中国，路不好通孩们回不来，两个媳妇子也给饿跑了，到如今没回来，全家八口人，如今只留下我一个了，我翻身只是应了个空名。今年七月间，人家都分了好几回果实了，我问俺邻家为啥不叫我分果实，邻家说：“你不在农会不能批”，我说：“为啥不叫俺在农会？”邻家说：“干部嫌你落后哩。”我去找政治主任杨玉锁，跑了好几趟，才叫我进了农会，分给我一张棹子、一个水缸、一个破箱子、十斤花、一身衣裳、几件衣裳片子，我没米吃还没米吃。只能靠给人家洗衣裳，做活弄几斤米喝喝，做一锅稀饭喝好几顿。“夏天纺花还有花，现下连个花毛子也没有了。夏天我赚了四千块钱，都入到合作社，指望腊月批个利，籴点米，过年时也吃两顿稠饭，借俺妹妹的两千块钱也该还了，谁知道人家合作社掌柜不叫批。说上边有命令，怕浪费哩，今年一律不批红。明年二月才能批，这一下子可把穷人治死了，别说过年吃好哩，连米也吃不上。”她说到这里停住了，我抬头一看，她落下眼泪来了，我马上安慰她说：“老太太不要哭了，你在农会上没有听念土地法大纲吗？现在要彻底平分土地了。每人要分一份土地和财产，就象你这样贫苦户不但要分一份，还要特别的照顾你呢！”她唉了一声说：“毛主席的办法实在好，可是俺村的干部就不照着好好办，越是有人有手能说会道的家户，越是多能批东西，就象我这越穷越没有人的人家户，越不能批东西……。”
    象这样应了一个翻身空名的人一定不仅是王三妮娘一个，希望各地同志们好好留意他们的困难和要求。
