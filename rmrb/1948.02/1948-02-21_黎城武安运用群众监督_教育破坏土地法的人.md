According to reports from Zanhuang, Huguan, Zuoquan, Neiqiu, Licheng, and Wu'an counties in Taihang: The "Outline Land Law of China," the "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Those Who Sabotage Land Reform," the "Letter to All Party Members," and the "Letter to All Peasants" have not been adequately used as weapons in some areas to educate the masses and cadres in order to stop acts of sabotage. In some individual places, simple administrative orders and detention and punishment measures have been adopted. For example, Zhang Baozi from Huayuan Village in Zanhuang secretly sold more than one mu of paddy land after hearing the news of land distribution, taking advantage of the fact that the masses were not yet aware of it. The public security director and the militia committee director of Ziliang Village in the Sixth District of Huguan registered the property of all the masses in the village, and the village finance and grain director, who mobilized the masses to cut down trees, were also detained in the district. Although these cadres felt some pressure from the district from above, they did not admit their mistakes to the masses and bow their heads, nor did they receive education and transformation from the masses. In Zuoquan and Neiqiu, on the surface, it seems that the masses have risen to stop the village's acts of sabotage against the Land Law, but in reality, it is still the cadres' administrative orders. For example, Bai Changxing, the village chief of Xijie Village in the First District of Neiqiu, sold trees and two dou of grain. It is said that the poor and hired peasants also removed him from his position and sent him to the county government detention center. Whether the poor and hired peasants were mobilized is still under investigation. Some places think that using the poor and hired peasants to detain people is the mass line, but in fact, it is still their own administrative orders and bureaucratic style at work. This approach cannot enable cadres to be supervised and transformed by the masses of the whole village, nor can it mobilize all the peasants to consciously oppose the sabotage of the Land Law. Some places have some good practices in preventing the sabotage of the Land Law: For example, Yang Changquan, the village chief of Tian'erzhuang Village in the Ninth District of Wu'an, privately sold seventy-six sheep after the Land Law was announced and suppressed the masses very severely. The district did not adopt detention measures. Before the poor and hired peasants were mobilized, he was first transferred to the district to reflect for a few days, and in order to educate the cadres of the entire district, he was removed from his post. Then he was allowed to return to the village to reflect on his mistakes among the masses. The whole village not only deeply publicized the Land Law, but also sent representatives to the village cadres' meeting to give him many opinions. This educated the cadres and also educated the masses to support the Land Law. The masses of Sanbaishu Village in the Eighth District of Wu'an have very bright eyes after publicizing the Land Law. Therefore, when they discovered that the political director Zhang Shulin was helping a few people in the village to sell trees and sabotage the Land Law, they immediately connected everyone to stop it, stopped the tree felling, and reported it to the district. The government has removed Zhang from his post and let him reflect among the masses. The same is true for the masses of Lijia Kiln in Licheng. They have the Land Law as their foundation, and they are bolder. When someone in the village sabotaged the Land Law for the first time, they were stopped by the masses of the whole village. Later, Li Yun, a conscription committee member, sold things for the landlord and was immediately stopped by the masses, and the bad cadre was reported and prepared to be dealt with together during the distribution. Under this kind of mass, anytime, anywhere supervision, no one in the village dared to sabotage it anymore.

### 黎城武安运用群众监督　教育破坏土地法的人

　　黎城武安运用群众监督
　　教育破坏土地法的人
    【本报消息】据太行赞皇、壶关、左权、内邱、黎城、武安等县的报导：对中国土地法大纲、破坏土地改革治罪暂行条例、告党员书以及告农民书等文件，一部分地区还没很好的当作武器来运用，教育群众，教育干部，以制止破坏行为。个别地方，只是简单的采取了一种行政命令和扣押惩办的办法。如赞皇花园村张包子听到平分土地的消息后，乘群众还不知道，就偷偷的把一亩多水地卖掉了。壶关六区子良庄公安主任、武委会主任带民兵登记了全村群众的财产，村财粮主任，发动群众砍树，也一同被扣押到区上。这些干部，虽感受到区上自上而下的一点压力，但并没有在群众中认错低头，得到群众的教育和改造。在左权、内邱从表面上看，好象群众已经起来阻止村里破坏土地法的行为了，实际上仍是干部的行政命令。如内邱一区西街村长白长兴，卖了树又卖了二斗粮食，据说贫雇也撤了他的职，把他送到县府看守所里。是不是贫雇发动起来了，还可以调查，有些地方以为通过贫雇去扣人押人便算是群众路线，其实还是自己的行政命令、官僚主义作风在作怪。这种作法并不能使干部得到全村群众的监督和改造，也不能发动全体农民自觉的反对破坏土地法。有些地方阻止破坏土地法，也有一些好的作法：如武安九区田二庄村长杨常全在土地法公布后，私卖了七十六只羊，压制群众也很厉害，区上没有采用扣押的办法，在贫雇没有发动以前，先调他到区上反省了几天，并为了教育全区干部撤了他的职，然后让他回村在群众中反省认错，全村一面深入宣传土地法，一面又派代表在村干部会上向他提了许多意见。这样教育了干部，也教育了群众拥护土地法。武安八区三柏树群众，经过宣传土地法，他们的眼睛是很亮的。因此当他们发现政治主任张树林，帮助村里少数几个人卖树破坏土地法时，他们即串连大家去制止，停止了砍树，并报告区上，政府已将张撤了职，并让他在群众中反省。黎城栗家窑群众也是一样，他们有土地法作底子，胆子就大了。当村里第一次有人破坏土地法时，就被全村群众制止了。以后抗勤委员栗云替地主卖东西，也立即被群众卡住，并将这个坏干部检举出来，准备在平分时一同处理。在这种群众性的随时随地监督下，村里再也没有人敢破坏了。
