Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 18th: The People's Liberation Army field army continues to sweep away enemy strongholds on the periphery of Shenyang. In the past ten days (from the 7th to the 16th), nearly 5,000 enemy troops have been annihilated. A brief account of the operations and a summary of the results are as follows:

	South of Shenyang: After the PLA captured Liaoyang on the 6th, it swept north to eliminate the remaining enemies. On the 8th, it captured more than ten strongholds, including Shahebao, Wulijie, and Liutanggou, annihilating and capturing more than 1,000 enemy troops from the 52nd Army's 2nd Division and the 79th Division, which was reorganized from the original Provisional 55th Division (note: this division was completely annihilated by us in the Battle of Zhangwu). North of Shenyang: Another unit of our army annihilated a total of more than 2,800 enemy troops from the New 6th Army, the New 22nd Division, the 14th Division, the 169th Division, the New 1st Army's New 30th Division, and the New 3rd Army's 54th Division in the vicinity of Shifosi between the 12th and 14th. Due to unfavorable combat conditions, the enemy army became extremely savage and even released a large amount of poison gas, resulting in the poisoning of some of our soldiers. The enemy's Provisional 62nd Division, which was besieged in Faku, attempted to break through to the south between the 13th and 15th, but was partly annihilated by our forces and pushed back into the isolated city, living in constant fear. West of Shenyang: Our unit successively captured several important stations on the Xinmin-Shenyang section of the Beining Railway, including Masanjiazi, Laobian, and Xinglongdian, between the 12th and 16th, annihilating and capturing a total of more than 700 enemy troops from the 71st Army's 91st Division, the New 1st Army's 50th Division, and an armored train squadron. Our army also captured two enemy armored trains at Laobian Station, bringing the total number of armored trains of the Northeast bandit army captured by the PLA to four, including the two previously captured by us near Siping and Suizhong. A preliminary summary of the battle results in the past ten days is as follows: a total of 4,921 enemy troops were annihilated, including 2,863 killed and wounded, and 2,058 captured alive. The following were seized: 2 mountain guns, 45 mortars, 60mm guns, and small guns, 8 grenade launchers, 159 light and heavy machine guns, 197 submachine guns, 1,025 rifles and carbines, 254,792 rounds of various bullets, 1,718 shells, 1 tank, 3 armored vehicles, 2 armored trains, and many other military supplies.
