[Taihang News] The factional fighting incident between Xiawan Village in Licheng and Xiangtangpu Village in She County, incited by landlords and bad village cadres, has been resolved after the administrative office and the county governments of Licheng and She mobilized poor and hired peasants, united the middle peasants, and jointly punished the masterminds and culprits. The details of the incident and its handling are summarized below:

On December 25th of last year, fifteen people from Xiangtangpu Village went to cut firewood on a forbidden mountain in the southwest of Xiawan Village. Wang Xiaotun, the militia instructor of Xiawan Village, Wang Sigen, the deputy instructor and public security officer, and Xu Dekui, the deputy village chief, upon learning of this, led the militia to the mountain to block them with weapons; Wang Xiaotun and Wang Sigen even fired shots and threw grenades as a show of force. Li Yinshuo, a district cadre working in Xiawan, and Yang Zhifa, the political director of Xiangtangpu, upon hearing the gunfire, went to the mountain to mediate. After discussion, the result was: the cut firewood would be stored separately by the two villages and not used temporarily until the issue was resolved. Later, Yang Zhifa saw that more and more people from Xiangtangpu Village were arriving, and he immediately changed his mind, saying, "The masses do not agree to store it separately; I cannot control it." He incited the crowd, causing both sides to fight over the firewood, and as a result, all the firewood was taken away by Xiangtangpu.

Most of the masses thought the matter was over. However, the landlords, rich peasants, and rogue cadres of the two villages took the opportunity to instigate and create incidents. Xiangtangpu, led by political director Yang Zhifa and farmers' association director Wu Yuming, wrote a "challenge" letter to Xiawan overnight, falsely claiming the opinions of the masses: "It must be cut in the future." They sent cadres to the people's school to "mobilize" the masses, saying, "We must go and cut." Wu Yuming even verbally notified Shentou, Gouzhuang, Qiankuanzhang, and Houkuanzhang villages to go and cut firewood, attempting to expand the situation. This plan was not realized due to the snowfall. They told two district cadres who were attending a meeting in the village about this plan, and the bureaucratic district cadres, without investigating the details, approved it, saying it was a "good idea." Xiawan Village, led by village chief Li Tingtang and farmers' association director Zheng Laohu, held mass meetings to "mobilize" resistance to cutting firewood and "selected" eight representatives to prepare to file a lawsuit. At the same time, they wrote back to Xiangtangpu: "You must not cut it"; and designated political director Zhang Zangzi (who was used by bad cadres) to file a complaint with the county government. Upon hearing this news, the county governments of Licheng and She immediately issued an order to "suspend cutting firewood and await processing," but the cadres of Xiangtangpu completely ignored it. The cadres of Xiawan Village also wanted to continue the disturbance.

On January 11th, Xiangtangpu, after a "general mobilization," had more than twenty people go to the forbidden mountain to cut firewood. Li Tingtang, the village chief of Xiawan Village, Zheng Laohu, the director of the farmers' association, and others ordered that no one in the village was allowed to go out and all were to prepare to block the firewood cutting; they instructed village deputy Xu Dekui to lead six people to the mountain first. Li Tingtang, Wang Xiaotun, and five others also followed them up the mountain, and Li Tingtang took the lead in grabbing two farmers from Xiangtangpu who were cutting firewood. Feng Yuanxin, the deputy of Xiangtangpu Village, upon hearing this news, immediately broadcast to the whole village: "Everyone must go up the mountain to seize the firewood, and each merchant is only allowed to leave one person to look after the house." Some bad elements also encouraged from the sidelines, "concentrating" thirty to forty people who were forced to go up the mountain. Many honest farmers were unwilling to go but did not dare to object. Zhang Yuxi, the production director of the village, took the opportunity to shout on the mountain: "Come quickly, our villagers are being dragged down and carried away!" He only incited and teased others, while he watched the excitement from the sidelines. After these incitements, the masses of Xiangtangpu kept pouring into Xiawan, and both sides started fighting. Wang Badan, a scoundrel from Xiawan, encouraged others to fight everywhere, but he secretly left. Li Tingtang, Zheng Laohu, and other bad cadres, the culprits of the village, seeing the chaotic fight, also took the opportunity to run away. As a result, three or four farmers from each village were seriously injured. Xiawan, being outnumbered, fled west. The people of Xiangtangpu then captured four farmers in the village. Just as they were about to return, district cadre Li Yinshuo saw that one of them was Li Kuahai, a correspondent from the administrative office's hospital, and negotiated his release. Wu Yuming, the director of the farmers' association of Xiangtangpu, and the rogue scoundrel Cheng Lao Si said: "The last time he fired the gun was under the leadership of worker Li (a false accusation), and this time he released the thug Li Kuahai." They incited the cadres and ordered the masses to arrest Li Yinshuo and Li Kuahai together and drag them back to the village. This time, the landlord Nai Ting also took the opportunity to join in, and the cadres even thought he was "one of our own." From the road to the village, Zhang Yuxi led a few people to beat Yinshuo, Kuahai, and others severely. Zhang Yuxi also insulted Li Yinshuo as a "traitor and special agent, eating public millet, it is better to feed it to dogs, let him 'ride in a foreign car' (meaning to be dragged)." That night, they were all detained. In the dark, Li Yinshuo took the opportunity to escape back to the district, while the others were suspended and did not escape. When the masses heard that worker Li had been dragged and beaten, they all reflected that it was wrong, but they were scolded by Wu Yuming and other cadres. After the beating, the masses of Xiawan Village immediately ran to the district and county governments for help. Pin Gu Tang hid in a mountain cave for two days and two nights without food and did not dare to go back.

After receiving the report, the Taihang Administrative Office immediately sent Comrade Geng Zhenlin to cooperate with the cadres of Licheng and She counties to investigate and deal with the matter separately. When they first arrived, the masses of the two villages were very uneasy, and the landlords and rogue cadres secretly encouraged the masses to fight to the end, resisting with all their might. Comrade Geng and others then convened a general meeting to announce: "Beating people, especially beating farmers, is against the law. This matter is entirely the responsibility of the village cadres, and the masses are blindly following. Now, everyone should be released first, and all firewood cutting on the forbidden mountain should be stopped. Who is right and who is wrong will be investigated and resolved later. We farmers of the world are one family. We fight each other, making the landlords happy. We will not fall for this trick." Both villages did so, and the emotions of the masses began to stabilize. The cadres felt that they were wrong and could no longer resist, so they began to lower their heads. At this time, the county and district cadres decided to handle this factional dispute from a class perspective. On the one hand, they organized cadres to hold meetings to reflect, and on the other hand, they started from inspecting the land reform, mobilizing the poor peasants and hired laborers, uniting the middle peasants, reviewing the cadres, and finally handling the matter through democratic discussion. The mobilization of the poor peasants and hired laborers began with the issue of fighting, but they were not interested. Some still spoke from the village's perspective. Seeing that this method was not right, the county and district cadres immediately changed their approach, setting aside the fighting and directly talking about the poor life of the poor peasants and hired laborers. In Xiawan Village, they found Zhang Yueming, a sixty-year-old hired laborer with a blood lineage, and from reminiscing about the past to the turn over, they learned about the situation of the village cadres in detail. He said: "Fighting is caused by the cadres being full and messing around, making the masses uneasy." The cadres relied on him to collude with eleven or twelve poor peasants and hired laborers, and then mobilized them to collude with all the poor peasants and hired laborers. In the process of colluding and mobilizing, on the one hand, they complained about the bitterness of "not turning over," and on the other hand, they promoted the Land Law: "Let us poor people be the masters of our own house, fight against feudalism, and replace bad cadres"; and emphasized: "Fighting is intentionally disrupting the harmony of us farmers, inducing us to forget about fighting the landlords and moving stones. We will not be fooled!" After colluding and mobilizing for five or six days, they convened a general meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers to review the cadres and discuss the handling methods. Everyone accused the bad cadres who led the fighting, and according to the size of the past crimes, they put forward handling opinions. Finally, they discussed: "Uniting the middle peasants, with more people and strength, can overthrow the bad cadres." They unanimously proposed: Each person should unite two or three middle peasants. At this time, the middle peasants reflected: "The honest people are really fair," which further encouraged the poor peasants and hired laborers to boldly stand up and lead. In a very short time, they united all the middle peasants, and then convened a mass meeting, electing three poor peasants to be the presidium to lead. Xiangtangpu's approach was the same as Xiawan's. The mass meeting of Xiawan Village decided: Li Tingtang was removed from the position of village chief, released on bail with a guarantee, not allowed to be active, and all family property was registered and sealed. Zheng Laohu, the director of the farmers' association, was dismissed, fined 30,000 catties of firewood, released on bail with a guarantee, not allowed to be active, and not allowed to use family property at will. Zhang Zangzi, the political director, was dismissed. Wang Xiaotun, the militia instructor, was dismissed. Wang Sigen, the deputy instructor and public security officer, was dismissed and fined 20,000 catties of firewood. Xu Dekui, the deputy village chief, was given a major demerit. The mass meeting of Xiangtangpu decided: Wu Yuming, the director of the farmers' association, and Zhang Yuxi, the production director, who were the most active in leading the fighting, were dismissed and sent to the county government for handling. Yuxi compensated worker Li for 20,000 yuan in medical expenses. Feng Yuanxin, the village deputy, was dismissed and fined 1,500 catties of firewood. Yang Zhifa, the political director, and Feng Zhuting, the deputy public security officer, were leniently treated with a major demerit each because they were active in fighting the landlords and doing other work. The scoundrels Wang Badan and Cheng Lao San from both villages were also punished as they deserved.

On January 28th, each village selected twenty representatives of poor peasants and middle peasants, along with cadres from each village, to convene a joint meeting for a celebration. Each made a self-criticism and unanimously recognized: "These sectarian contradictions were passed down from the old society and were the means by which landlords ruled and harmed us poor people, and we must resolutely overthrow them." Finally, it was decided: the mountain is still a forbidden mountain, and both sides will go together to mark it clearly. Back home, they must carry out ideological education among the masses on "farmers of the world are one family" and unite well. In the future, in supporting the front, they must be considerate of each other and help solve difficulties. This meeting was extremely harmonious from beginning to end.

    坏村干挑动下湾向堂铺两村打架
    行署依靠贫雇圆满解决
    撤换坏干部。两村派代表联欢
    【太行消息】黎城下湾、涉县向堂铺两村，在地主及坏村干挑动下发生的宗派殴打事件，经行署及黎、涉两县府发动雇贫、团结中农，联合惩办了主谋祸首分子，已经获得解决。现将事情的经过和处理情形，摘要报导于后：
    去年十二月二十五日，向堂铺群众十五人，到下湾村西南一座禁山上割柴。下湾民兵指导员王小吞、副指导员兼公安员王四根、副村长徐德魁知道了，带领民兵上山武装阻拦；王小吞、王四根并打枪、扔手榴弹示威。在下湾工作的区干李银锁和向堂铺政治主任杨志发听到枪声，先后上山调解。商量结果：把割下的柴分别由两村保存，暂不动用，等问题解决后再说。后来杨志发看到向堂铺村人慢慢来的多了，马上变卦，说“群众不同意分开保存，自己掌握不住”。并进行挑动，使双方夺起柴来，结果柴全被向堂铺夺走。
    一般群众都以为已经了事。但是，两村的地主富农及流氓干部却乘机煽动，制造事件。向堂铺以政治主任杨志发、农会主任武玉明为首，连夜给下湾写了一封“挑战”信，假造群众意见：“今后非割不可”。一面派干部到民校“动员”群众说：“一定要去割”。武玉明更口头通知神头、沟庄、前后宽漳等村也去割，企图扩大事态，后因下雪未成。他们当时给在该村开会的两个区干部说了这个计划，区干部官僚主义的不问底细就批准了，还说是“好办法”。下湾村是以村长李庭堂、农会主任郑老虎为首，召开群众会，“动员”阻拦割柴，还“选”出八个代表，准备专门打官司。同时给向堂铺写回信：“你们一定不能割”；并指定政治主任张脏子（被坏干部利用）到县府告状。黎、涉两县府听到这种消息，立即明令“暂停割柴，听候处理”，但向堂铺干部根本不理。下湾干部也要继续大闹。
    一月十一日，向堂铺在“总动员”后，又有二十多人到禁山割柴。下湾村村长李庭堂、农会主任郑老虎等，一面下令全村任何人不准外出，都准备拦阻割柴的；一面指示村副徐德魁带领六人先行上山。李庭堂、王小吞等五人也随着上山，李庭堂并先下手抓了向堂铺两个割柴的农民。向堂铺村副冯元新听到这个消息，即向全村广播：“不论谁都得一律上山夺柴，各商户只准留一人看家”。有些坏分子又从旁鼓动，“集中”了三四十人被迫上山，不少老实农民不愿去，但不敢反对。该村生产主任张玉玺更乘机在山上大喊：“赶快来，把咱村人拖倒抬走啦！”他只鼓动与捉弄别人，自己却在一旁看热闹。经过这些挑动，向堂铺群众便一直涌进下湾，双方乱打起来。下湾坏蛋王疤蛋，到处鼓动别人去打，他却偷偷离开。该村祸首李庭堂、郑老虎等坏干部一见乱打起来，也瞅空偷跑了。结果两村农民，各重伤三、四人。下湾因人少抵不住，纷纷向西逃跑。向堂铺的人即在村里抓了四个农民。正要往回走，区干部李银锁见其中有一个是行署医院通讯员李跨孩，即交涉释放了。向堂铺农会主任武玉明和流氓坏蛋程老四说：“上次打枪是李工作员领导（是诬赖），这次又放走打手李跨孩”。随着就鼓动干部、命令群众又把李银锁和李跨孩一齐抓上，拖回村里。这回该村地主乃亭也乘机混入参加，干部还认为是“自己人”。从路上到村里，张玉玺带领少数人将银锁、跨孩等痛打一顿，张玉玺并辱骂李银锁是“汉奸特务，吃了公家小米，不如喂狗，叫他‘坐洋车’（拖拉的意思）”。当晚便都扣起来。黑夜，李银锁瞅空逃回区上，其余都是吊着，没有逃脱。群众听说拖打了李工作员，都反映不对，被武玉明等干部顶了一顿。下湾村群众在殴打后，当即跑到区上、县府求救。贫雇根堂藏到山洞，两天两夜没有吃饭，也不敢回去。
    太行行署得到报告后，当即派耿振林同志，协同黎、涉两县干干，分别前去调查处理。刚去时两村群众非常不安，地主流氓干部还暗地鼓动群众闹到底，极力抵抗。耿同志等这时便先召集大会，宣布：“打人，特别是打农民是犯法的，这事完全由村干部负责，群众是盲从的。现在都先放人，禁山柴一律停割，谁是谁非，听候查明解决。本来咱天下农民是一家，自己相互打架，让地主高兴，我们不上这个当。”两村都这么作了，群众情绪开始安定。干部已感到自己错了，再抵抗不得，开始低头。这时，县区干部决定用阶级观点处理这一宗派纠纷，一面组织干部开会反省，一面从检查土地改革入手，发动雇贫，团结中农，审查干部，最后由民主讨论处理。开始发动雇贫，先从打架问题谈起，他们不感兴趣，有的还是站在村本位上说话。县区干部看到这种方法不对，马上改变，撇开打架不谈，直接从雇贫眼下的穷生活谈起。在下湾村找到了六十多岁的血统雇贫张约明，从拉时光谈到翻身，把村干部的情形弄了个一清二楚。他说：“打架是干部吃饱饭，没事情瞎胡闹，弄的群众不安。”干部们依托他串通了十一、二个雇贫，又发动他们去串通全体雇贫。在串通过程中，一面诉“没翻身”的苦，一面宣传土地法：“让咱穷人当家，斗争封建，撤换坏干部”；并着重说明：“打架是人家存心破坏咱农民不和气，引诱咱忘掉斗地主，搬石头，咱不上当！”串通发动了五、六天，就召开全体雇贫会，审查干部，讨论处理办法。大家纷纷控告了领导打架的坏干部，并按历来罪恶大小，提出处理意见，最后又讨论：“团结中农，人多气壮，才能斗倒坏干部。”一致提出：每人要团拢两三个中农。中农这时纷纷反映：“老实人办事真公道”，更鼓舞了雇贫大胆挺身出来领导。很短的时间，就团拢起全体中农，接着召开群众大会，选举了三个雇贫农当主席团，出面领导。向堂铺的作法也和下湾一样。下湾村群众大会决定：李庭堂撤销村长职，取保具结，不准活动，家产全部登记查封。农会主任郑老虎撤职，罚柴三万斤，取保具结，不准活动，不准随意动用家产。政治主任张脏子撤职。民兵指导员王小吞撤职。副指导员兼公安员王四根撤职，罚柴两万斤。村副徐德魁记大过一次。向堂铺群众大会决定：领导打架最积极的农会主任武玉明、生产主任张玉玺撤职，送县府处理，玉玺赔偿李工作员医疗费两万元。村副冯元新撤职，罚柴一千五百斤。政治主任杨志发、副公安员冯竹庭因平时斗地主及作其他工作积极，宽大处理，各记大过一次。两村的坏蛋王疤蛋、程老三等，也都受到应得的处分。
    一月二十八号，两村各选出雇贫和中农代表二十人，连带各村干部，召开联席会议联欢。各自作了检讨，一致认识到：“这些宗派矛盾是旧社会传下来的，是地主统治和糟害咱穷人的手法，要坚决打倒。”最后决定：山还是禁山，双方一块去划清标记。回去要在群众中进行“天下农民是一家人”的思想教育，好好团结。今后在支差中，要互相体贴和帮助解决困难。这个会从头到尾，都表现了格外的融洽。
