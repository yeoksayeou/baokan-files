    After the publication of documents such as the Land Law Outline, the Letter to Peasants, and the Letter to Party Members, many cadres and Party members who had made mistakes showed good behavior. They realized that their past actions, such as taking too much fruit, shielding landlords, etc., were wrong. They said, "We did get more of the fruit in the past, and we have to return it to the people. If our attitude is not good, we have to change it and not push it onto others." They didn't indulge in excessive eating and drinking, and expressed their willingness to bow their heads to the masses and admit their mistakes. Although this is only the beginning of recognizing their mistakes, and correcting them will require a good process of self-awareness, we believe that this is the minimum attitude that cadres and Party members should have in implementing the Land Law Outline. However, many cadres are not like this. They "knowingly violate the law," secretly transferring property and indulging in excessive eating and drinking. Some even openly collude with and intimidate poor peasants and hired laborers, organizing fake "Poor Peasants Associations" to suppress the poor peasants and hired laborers on the one hand and cover up their mistakes to higher authorities on the other. In addition, village cadres hide newspapers reporting on the Land Law, preventing the masses from seeing them. In Xiyang, some district cadres even detained newspapers and prohibited the masses from reading them, citing the excuse of fearing that it would hinder mass production. In Qinyang, one district prohibited the publicity of the Land Law. We have already received reports from correspondents and telegrams from branch offices about such incidents occurring in more than twenty counties. In many places, the above-mentioned destructive behaviors have been correctly stopped, but in some places, the leadership had previously adopted a laissez-faire attitude, failing to actively expose or stop the acts of sabotaging the Land Law among the masses, and sitting idly by as mistakes expanded. Recently, there have been instances of simply detaining and punishing people, thinking that detention alone can stop it. We believe that acts of sabotaging the Land Law must be resolutely and effectively stopped, and no carelessness should be allowed. Local experiences have proven that the best way to stop this is to use the Letter to Party Members, the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against the Land Law, and the Letter to Peasants as the main weapons to actively educate the peasants and cadres, mobilize the masses to stop acts of sabotaging the Land Law, and at the same time, educate cadres not to repeat their mistakes, to make them understand the greater righteousness, to point out a way out, and to make them honestly listen to the people's judgment. Necessary punishment should be given to certain individual bad cadres who are incorrigible and deeply hated by the masses, "punishing one as a warning to a hundred." The example of Tian Erzhuang in Wu'an, where the bad village chief who sabotaged the Land Law was removed from his post, made the cadres in the surrounding villages honest. This kind of necessary punishment must be combined with mobilizing the broad masses of peasants to spontaneously stop the sabotage of the Land Law and with patient and in-depth education work to be more effective. Therefore, we hope that all localities will conduct an inspection to more effectively stop all acts of sabotaging the Land Law.

    再不要在人民面前犯罪了！
    土地法大纲、告农民书、告党员书等文件发表后，不少犯了错的干部、党员表现还好，他们知道了自己过去多占果实，包庇地主……等行为是错误的，他们说：“果实过去咱们就是得的多，得给老百姓退。态度不好，就得改，不能往上边推。”他们不大吃大喝，表示向群众低头、认错，虽然这才只是开始知错，要改错还要经过很好的自觉过程，但我们认为，这是干部党员执行土地法大纲起码的态度。也有不少干部不是如此，他们是“知法犯法”，暗地转移财产，大吃大喝；有的竟公然拉拢与威吓贫雇，组织假“贫农团”，想一手压住贫雇，一手向上级掩盖错误。此外村干把登土地法的报纸藏起来，不让群众看，昔阳甚至还有的区干部借口害怕妨碍群众生产，扣押报纸，禁止群众读。沁阳有一个区禁止宣传土地法。我们已收到的通讯员稿件及分社来电中，已有二十余县发生这类事件。不少地方对以上种种破坏行为是正确制止了，但还有些地方，在领导上，前一个时期是采取放任自流态度，对破坏土地法的事不去积极的在群众中公开揭破或制止，坐视错误扩大，到了最近又发生有单纯扣押惩办的现象，以为扣押了就可以制止了。我们觉得对破坏土地法行为必须坚决的有效的制止，绝不允许丝毫马虎。这种制止办法各地经验证明最好是以告党员书，破坏土地法治罪条例，告农民书为主要武器，在农民中在干部党员中积极的进行教育，发动群众制止破坏土地法的行为，同时教育干部不要一错再错，错上加错，晓以大义，指给出路，使其老老实实听候人民处理。对于某些个别怙恶不悛为群众所十分痛恨的坏干部给以必要的惩办，“惩一儆百”也是应该的。武安田二庄把破坏土地法的坏村长撤了职，影响周围各村干部都老实起来，便是一个好例子。这种必要的惩办必须同发动广大农民自动起来制止破坏土地法，同耐心深入教育工作结合起来，才更有力量。因此我们希望各地做一检查，以便更有效的制止一切破坏土地法行为。
