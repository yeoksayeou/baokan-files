Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Moscow dispatch: The Hungarian President Tildy, personally leading Prime Minister Dinnyés, Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi, and Szakasits and other government delegation members, visited the Soviet capital on the 16th. After meeting with Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Molotov, Deputy Chairman and Foreign Minister, they signed the Soviet-Hungarian Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in the Kremlin on the 18th. The treaty was signed by Molotov on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and by Dinnyés on behalf of the Hungarian President. Stalin, Voroshilov, Tildy, and Veres (Hungarian Minister of Defense) all personally attended the ceremony. The main contents of the treaty are:

    I. The contracting parties guarantee to eliminate the threat of renewed aggression by Germany or any country allied with Germany in any way.

    II. If one of the contracting parties is at war with Germany, or with any country that jointly with Germany engages in aggression in Europe attempting to restore its policy of aggression, or any country that is allied with Germany in any form to carry out a policy of aggression, the other contracting party shall immediately provide military and all other assistance.

    III. Neither contracting party shall participate in any alliance or action aimed against the other party.

    IV. The contracting parties shall consult each other on all important international issues affecting the interests of both countries.

    V. The contracting parties reaffirm their determination to develop and consolidate economic and cultural relations between the two countries in a spirit of friendly cooperation. The two countries shall abide by principles of mutual respect for each other's independence and national sovereignty, and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Moscow dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, after the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance on the 18th, made a speech stating: After the conclusion of this treaty, the Soviet Union and its western neighboring countries, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, have mutual assistance treaties. We, the Soviet people, believe that this is a major achievement in implementing Stalin's foreign policy aimed at strengthening friendship with neighboring countries and consolidating universal peace. Molotov pointed out: "The signing of the Soviet-Hungarian treaty is of extremely great significance for guaranteeing peace and security in Europe. According to the lessons of the Second World War, it is necessary to help peace-loving countries in Europe to prevent Germany or any country adopting a common policy of aggression with Germany from engaging in aggression again." Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés also made a speech, pointing out: "This treaty will guarantee our country's freedom and independence. We understand that imperialists do not want peace-loving and free people to have independence and unity. They hope to rule the world, and their main principle is to conquer other nations through war. This is the reason why our country and its neighboring countries have recently signed mutual assistance treaties. We must frankly admit that not long ago, there was still a danger in Hungary. That is, foreign imperialist elements colluding with domestic reactionaries in Hungary attempted to turn Hungary into a powerful base for anti-Soviet and anti-democratic activities. But now, Hungarian democracy has grown strong and powerful, and a new, independent Hungary has been established, and is willing to advance together with freedom-loving nations."

　　苏匈签订互助条约
    莫洛托夫说：这是斯大林外交政策的伟大成就。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科讯：匈牙利总统梯尔第亲率总理丁尼斯、副总理拉科西及斯查卡西克等政府代表团一行，于十六日聘问苏京，与苏联部长会议主席斯大林、副主席兼外长莫洛托夫会谈后，已于十八日在克里姆林宫签订苏匈二十年友好合作互助条约。条约分由莫洛托夫代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团，丁尼斯代表匈总统签字。斯大林、伏罗希洛夫、梯尔第、维列斯（匈国防部长）均亲自莅场观礼。条约主要内容为：
    一、缔约国保证消除德国或其他以任何方式与德国联合之国家再事侵略威胁。
    二、缔约国一方对德国，或对任何与德国共同在欧洲从事侵略行动企图恢复其侵略政策的国家，或以任何形式与德国联合进行侵略政策的国家发生战争时，缔约国他方应立即予以军事及其他一切援助。
    三、缔约国任何一方不得参加旨在反对他方之同盟集团或行动。
    四、缔约国双方应就影响两国利益之一切重要国际问题互相协商。
    五、缔约国双方重申决心，以友好合作精神，发展并巩固两国间经济与文化关系。两国当遵守互相尊重对方之独立与国家主权，以及不干涉对方内政之原则。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联外长莫洛托夫，十八日在苏匈友好合作互助条约签字后发表演说称：本约订立后，苏联与其西疆各邻国，从波罗的海至黑海，都已有了互助条约。我们苏联人民认为这是实行旨在加强与各邻国友谊，并巩固普遍和平的斯大林外交政策的重大成就。莫氏指出：“苏匈条约的签订，对于保证欧洲和平与安全，具有极重大的意义，根据第二次世界大战的教训，必须帮助欧洲爱好和平的国家，阻止德国或与德国采取共同侵略政策的任何国家再事侵略”。匈总理丁尼斯同时发表演说，指出：“本约将保证我国的自由与独立。我们了解帝国主义者不愿爱好和平与自由的人民有独立与团结，他们希望统治全世界，而其主要原则，就是以战争征服其他民族。这就是我国与各邻国最近订立互助条约的原因。我们必须坦白承认：不久以前，匈牙利还存在着危险，这就是与匈牙利国内反动派勾结的国外帝国主义分子，企图将匈牙利变为反苏反民主的有力基地。而现在，匈牙利的民主已经壮大有力，新的独立的匈牙利业已建立，并愿与爱好自由民族共同前进”。
