Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: Reports from various sources indicate that Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, recently delivered two notes to the US State Department on behalf of the Soviet government, protesting against the US imperialist aggression in violation of the Italian Peace Treaty. In his note of January 28th, it was pointed out that US warships carrying US Marines had docked at the Italian ports of Naples, Taranto, Livorno, and Genoa, in violation of Article 73 of the Italian Peace Treaty (which stipulates that the Allied armed forces stationed in Italy must withdraw from Italy before December 15, 1947). The Soviet government hopes that the US government will immediately take measures to stop the aforementioned violations of the Italian Peace Treaty. The Soviet government also forwarded the full text of the above note to the French government, requesting that it share the contents of the note with all Allied countries that signed the Italian Peace Treaty. Another Soviet note, issued on January 21st, protested against the separate agreement concluded by Britain and the United States to rebuild an air force base at Mellaha, near Tripoli, in the former Italian colony of Libya, temporarily under British control. The note pointed out that this is in conflict with the Italian Peace Treaty and is therefore illegal. The Soviet Union also sent the same note to the British government simultaneously. The illegal actions of Britain and the United States in the former Italian colonies have also aroused dissatisfaction among British and Egyptian democrats and public opinion. British Labour MP Mills recently questioned Secretary of State McNeil in the House of Commons, asking: On what grounds and under what international agreement did the British government agree to the United States rebuilding an air force base in Mellaha? McNeil, knowing that he was in the wrong, could not answer. Egyptian democratic newspapers have criticized the illegal actions of Britain and the United States, denouncing "the efforts of Britain and the United States, fully armed, to seize the land of other people through daylight robbery."

    美英违犯对意和约
    苏联提出抗议
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合各方讯：苏联驻美大使潘友新近代表苏政府先后向美国务院致送照会二件，抗议美帝国主义破坏对意和约的侵略行动。在其一月二十八日的照会中指出：美战舰载美海军陆战队停泊于意国那不勒斯、大兰多、里窝那、热那亚诸港，违反了意和约第七十三条（按即驻于意大利的盟国武装部队，须于一九四七年十二月十五日前撤离意大利），苏政府希望美政府立即采取措施停止对意和约的上述违反行为。苏联政府并将上一照会全文交与法政府，请共将该照会内容通知曾签字于意大利和约的诸盟国。苏联另一照会系于一月二十一日发出，抗议英美单独缔结协定，在暂由英控制的前意殖民地的黎波里附近麦拉哈重建空军基地。照会指出：这是与对意和约相抵触，因此为非法之举。苏联并将同样之照会同时致送英政府。英美在意前殖民地的非法行动，也激起英埃民主人士及舆论的不满。英工党议员米尔斯顷于下院质问国务大臣麦克纳尔称：英政府根据什么理由什么国际协议答应美国在麦拉哈重建空军基地？麦克纳尔自知理屈无言以答。埃及民主报纸纷纷抨击英美非法行为，痛斥“英美以全付武装努力用白日抢劫方式来夺取其它人民的土地”。
