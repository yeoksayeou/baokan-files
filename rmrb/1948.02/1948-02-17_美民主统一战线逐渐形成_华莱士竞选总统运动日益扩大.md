Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: TASS, New York: Binson, chairman of the "Wallace for President National Committee," recently told the press that Wallace's presidential campaign movement is expanding and strengthening. The committee has established branches in twelve states, and branches in another fourteen states are about to be established. Binson said: The American people want to cast their votes for Wallace's program of peace and prosperity. He believes that the committee's branches will be established in all forty-eight states. In addition, Blisson, chairman of the Independent Progressive Party of California, told the press that the party's campaign to collect 500,000 signatures to demand that Wallace be placed on the ballot has collected 335,000 signatures. The newly established People's Progressive Party of Florida also announced its support for Wallace. At the same time, the CIO Executive Board is facing a crisis of division after deciding not to support a third party. Brothman, the CIO's chief lawyer, has resigned in anger. It is reported that other left-wing union leaders will follow Brothman, which will result in a union withdrawing from the CIO. The CIO-affiliated Agricultural Machinery Workers Union has also announced its support for Wallace. Under the growing strength of democratic forces, the Truman administration has adopted shameless repressive measures. The US police are now preparing a "blacklist" of Wallace supporters. Binson has protested to Truman about this, denouncing it as no different from Hitler's secret police system.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: New York: The movement to support Wallace's presidential campaign "has reached a larger scale" (TASS). In New York State, the 500 delegates to the statewide conference of the American Progressive Citizens Association unanimously urged the mobilization of all democratic forces to implement the greatest cooperation to elect Wallace. The delegates also condemned the reactionary programs of the Democratic and Republican parties, which are both "forcing the United States into depression and new wars." Ohio has also begun a mass movement to support Wallace's campaign. A mass meeting was held in Columbus recently. According to a report by renowned Soviet journalist Zhukov on the current American people's movement: "A broad united front of American democratic forces is gradually forming in the struggle against reactionary forces." He pointed out: "The American Progressive Citizens Association has united a large number of progressive intellectuals, writers, scientists, artists, and supporters of Roosevelt's New Deal. They support Wallace's campaign. They know that the American reactionaries control the state apparatus and can still control most of the votes, but the American progressive forces are still fighting bravely against the enemy because they understand that they can only be tempered and gain experience in fierce struggle, which will be very useful in the future."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: TASS, New York: Binson, chairman of the "Wallace for President National Committee," issued a statement on the 4th stating that the Eastern Department of the National Farmers Union has endorsed Wallace as a candidate. Two hundred farmer representatives from New Jersey and Pennsylvania held a meeting in Trenton, New Jersey, and decided to support Wallace's campaign and condemned the Democratic and Republican parties for "engaging in a frenzied preparation for World War III."

    美民主统一战线逐渐形成
    华莱士竞选总统运动日益扩大
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：“华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”主席宾生，顷告报界称：华莱士竞选总统运动正在日益扩大与增强。该委员会已在十二州成立分会，另有十四州分会即将成立。宾生说：美国人民都希望把他们的选票投给华氏的和平繁荣纲领。他相信四十八州均将成立该委员会的分会。又加州独立进步党主席布利逊告报界称：该党为要求将华莱士列入选票名单上而发动的五十万人签名运动，已征得三十三万五千人的签名。佛罗里达州新成立的人民进步党，亦宣布支持华莱士。同时产联执行局在决议不支持第三党后，已面临分裂的危机。产联主要律师勃勒斯曼已愤而辞职。据悉：其他左翼职工领袖将追随勃氏之后，其结果将使某工会退出产联。产联所属的农业机械工会亦已宣布支持华莱士。杜鲁门政府在民主势力日益壮大之下，采取了无耻的高压手段。美警察现正拟制华莱士拥护者的“黑名单”。宾生为此已向杜鲁门提出抗议，斥此与希特勒的秘密警察制无异。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】纽约讯：支持华莱士竞选总统的运动，“已达到更大的规模”（塔斯社）。在纽约州，美国进步公民协会全州大会的五百名代表，一致敦促动员所有民主力量，实行最大的合作以选举华莱士，代表们并谴责民主、共和两党一致的反动政纲，都“在迫使美国走向萧条和新战争”。俄亥俄州也开始了支持华莱士竞选的群众运动，哥伦布城日前召开了群众大会。据苏联名记者朱可夫报导目前美国的人民运动称：“美国民主力量的广泛统一战线，正在与反动力量斗争中逐渐形成”。他指出：“美国进步公民协会已团结了大批进步知识分子，作家、科学家、艺术家及罗斯福新政的拥护者，他们支持华莱士的竞选运动。他们知道美国反动派操纵着国家机构，仍能控制大部分选票，但美国进步力量仍英勇地对敌作战，因为他们了解只有在猛烈斗争中才能受到锻炼并获取经验，这对于将来很有用处。”
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：“华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”主席宾生，于四日发表声明称：全国农会东方部已拥护华莱士为候选人。新泽西与宾夕法尼亚两州的农民代表二百人，曾在新泽西州之特伦顿城举行会议，决定支持华莱士竞选，并谴责民主共和两党“从事狂热的第三次世界大战的准备”。
