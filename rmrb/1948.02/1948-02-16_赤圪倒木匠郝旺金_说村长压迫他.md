Carpenter Hao Wangjin of Chige Dao Village
Says the Village Chief Oppresses Him

Hao Wangjin, a poor peasant from Chige Dao Village, Third District, Lucheng, recounts the injustice of being oppressed by cadres, asking everyone to judge whether it is reasonable or not:

　　I am fifty-four years old this year, and my hometown is Lin County. My family was poor when I was young, only cultivating a little over an acre of land. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, I fled to Pingshun and rented mountain slope land for three years, but still couldn't make a living. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, I settled in Chige Dao Village, Lucheng. During the famine years (thirty-third year of the Republic of China), the village office released the community granary, giving each poor person two and a half jin. I was the poorest in the village, and my six-member family only got ten jin. In the spring of the year (1947), there were two trees on the land allocated to me: a pear tree and a fruit tree. The village chief, Li Shutang, and the volunteer teacher, Shi Xiantang, moved both of my trees to their homes. Later, I wouldn't accept it, and they planted two small, finger-thick trees for me, but I didn't want them. In June, I wanted to trade my cow for a small donkey. I thought buying a small donkey would usually cost about 100,000 yuan, and my cow could sell for over 70,000 yuan. I wanted to ask the village chief to lend me 30,000 or 40,000 yuan so I could buy one. On the fifth day of the seventh lunar month, I went to the West Township fair to buy livestock. The village chief bought a mule and asked me to lend him 10,000 yuan. In order to get him to lend me the money, I lent it to him. Later, he didn't lend me the money, and even said that the 10,000 yuan he borrowed from me never happened. In the end, he only gave me 1,000 yuan, saying he only borrowed 1,000. But I was afraid of offending him, so I had to say that I might have forgotten. Now, I still haven't gotten back the 9,000 yuan. In the summer, my child got into a fight with the son of a landlord, Wang Guangyun. The village chief, Li Shutang, detained my child, but the landlord's son was fine. This winter, the organization is organizing production to solve the difficulties of the poor. I am a carpenter, and I went to Jingyu Village to work for others. I had only been there for a few days when the village chief called me back, saying that the village had provisions and that I couldn't go to other villages. He said I wasn't allowed to leave the village in the future. I thought it would be fine as long as I could earn some millet, but I stayed at home for a long time without any provisions. A few days later, a landlord died, and I went to help with the funeral. When talking about turning over a new leaf, I said that turning over a new leaf is not the same, there are good and bad aspects! The village chief immediately pursued me, asking: How much did the cave you live in cost? Even turning over a new leaf has become a shortcoming! Speaking of this, the cadres always turn over more thoroughly than the masses. For example, when distributing fruit (grain), the poor get the grain eaten by small bugs, while the cadres get the beans. Is that fair or not? I can't bear the losses I've suffered. A few days ago, I secretly went to the district to appeal and vent my grievances. But comrades Zhao and Wang from the district summoned the village chief to the district for a trip. He came back and said that I went to the district to accuse all the cadres and that he was preparing to mobilize the masses to struggle against me. Appealing to the district has brought me a crime! The village chief took a tree from the landlord Wang Guangyun, so he shielded him, and they didn't confiscate all his grain during the struggle. My family was allocated two plots of gully land when distributing the fruit, which were far worse than other people's gullies. From the perspective of his background, the village chief is a poor peasant, just like me, but he shouldn't forget the poor after becoming a cadre and then oppress the poor! When I talk about these things, tears keep flowing from my eyes, and my heart is pounding. Anyway, I have to vent my grievances, and I must make him understand this reason.

    赤圪倒木匠郝旺金
    说村长压迫他
    潞城三区赤圪倒村贫农郝旺金，诉说干部压迫他的冤苦，请大家来评评是理不是：
    我今年五十四岁啦，老家是林县。小时家里就穷，只种了一亩多地。民国二十五年逃到平顺，租种了三年山坡地，还是不能过，二十八年逃到潞城赤圪倒村按了家。灾荒年（民国三十三年）村公所放义仓，穷人每人按二斤半发，咱是这村头一个穷汉，六口人只吃了十斤。年时（一九四七年）春天给我分的地里有两棵树；一棵犁树，一棵果树，村长李述堂、义务教员史先堂把我两棵树都移到他家啦。后来我不行，人家给栽了两棵指头粗的小树，我不要。六月间我想把我的牛换成个小驴，心想买个小驴平常得十来万块钱，咱的牛能卖七万多块钱，想叫村长给咱贷上三几万块钱，就能买了。七月初五到西乡赶会买牲口，人家村长买了个骡子，叫给他借上一万块钱，咱为了叫人家给贷款，就给人家借上啦。后来款没给咱贷上，倒说借咱的一万块钱就没有这会事。结果只给了一千块，说是就借一千来。可是咱害人家怕，只好说可能是我忘啦。到现在这九千块还没要上。夏天我的小孩跟一个地主王光云家的儿子要，打起架来。村长李述堂把我小孩扣起来，地主家儿子可没事。今年冬天组织生产，要给穷人解决困难哩。我是个木匠，到在井峪村给人家作活，在那里才住了不几天，村长把我叫回来啦，并说村上有生活，你非去外村不可？今后不准你出村。咱想反正到那也是能赚上小米就行，可是在家住了多时，也没点生活。隔了几天死了个地主，给人家去打葬。说起翻身，我就说了个翻身是不一样，有好有坏吧！村长就追着我说：你住的窑花过几个钱？咱翻翻身也成了短处啦！说到这里，干部总比群众翻的透。比如说，分果实时（粮食），穷人分的是小虫吃了的谷，干部分的是豆子，你说公呀不公？我吃的亏吃不下啦，前几天偷着到区上访了访，松了松肚子。可是区上赵、王二同志把村长传到区上走了一趟，回去说我去区上告全体干部，还准备发动群众斗争我哩。给区上访访是给我坐下罪啦！村长要了地主王光云一棵树，就包庇他，斗争时没有弄完他的粮食。我家分果实分了两块沟地，要是比上旁人的沟可差的远哩呀。村长从出身成份上瞧，到是贫农，跟咱一样，可是不该当了干部忘了穷人，再来压迫穷人呀！我说起这些事来眼里的泪是流不断，心里也是跳哩。反正死活也松松我的肚子，我非和他说清这个理不行。
