[This newspaper's report] According to preliminary investigations by work personnel in Shidong Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, the thoroughness of the emancipation of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this village is still insufficient; cadres take too much of the fruits of labor and oppress the masses severely; some former landlords are even serving as cadres and are being protected by the village cadres from being struggled against.

Most of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this village make a living by cultivating mountain land and working as carpenters. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the upper-level figures of the Duan family, such as Duan Bingnan (former political director, recently dismissed because the masses considered him a feudal rich peasant), Duan Laiyou (chairman of the peasant association), Duan Yonghe (former village chief), etc., took turns controlling the village government. Poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and carpenters were suppressed by them, and they did not receive many fruits of land reform. According to a survey of 32 poor and lower-middle peasant households, the fruit points of 26 of them were below six. Xiao San, who had been cultivating mountain land outside and just returned, was only given two points. Zhang Wenbin (family member of a soldier), the manager of the cooperative, who the masses used to consider a feudal rich peasant, was given twelve points. In terms of land quality, the land of the poor and lower-middle peasants could not compare with that of the cadres; even in quantity, it was about the same. (This village has a total of 22 hectares of land, more than 230 households, and more than 700 people, with an average of more than three mu of land per person.) Now some poor peasants will soon have no food to eat. For example, Tu Jin had only two dou of corn and more than 30 jin of rice left before the new year, and still owed 42 jin of wheat (borrowed some to pay public grain) and 76 jin of rice.

Regarding the situation of the cadres, poor peasant Ying Huiniang said: Shidong is a "Ten-Household Democracy." That is to say, only a few main cadres in the whole village are in charge, monopolizing affairs and acting recklessly. Duan Bingnan occupied three mu of land belonging to the poor peasant Duan Yonglin, and only returned it after he was dismissed, and even then he returned it to the peasant association. Duan Bingnan also occupied the house of the poor peasant Duan Xianghua, forcing Duan Xianghua to cry all night before he reluctantly moved. The village cadres stipulated that old bachelors and old widows would not be taken care of unless they were family members of soldiers. The reason was that they would not live for many more years, so who would they leave the distributed items to if they were given too much? For craftsmen, no matter whether they could maintain their family life, they were given fewer points. The cadres, however, wanted to be given more points, arguing that they were delaying their work by handling official affairs. As a result, cadres taking more fruits of labor and stealing fruits of labor became very serious. In order to oppose cadres taking too much of the fruits of labor, some poor peasants suffered heavy blows from the cadres. Duan Chunlin (poor peasant), a demobilized soldier, raised objections at the meeting of family members of soldiers because he saw that the distribution of fruits of labor was unfair. As a result, the village cadres deprived him of his right to speak for two months and also revoked the ten points of fruit he had originally received. Later, after the district cadres raised objections, he was given seven points back. The village cadres gave Ying Huiniang two points, which she thought was too little. Zhang Xixiu, a member of the peasant association, said: "You think it's too little! [a vulgar expression]!" The village cadres simply did not give her any. Later, others persuaded them to give her one point. Afterwards, when distributing fruits of labor, they demoted her to the fifth class. The masses said: "Give as much as you give, if you raise objections, you won't even have this little bit of fruit."

### 石洞村是“十家民主”  干部一窝蜂报复群众  贫雇动不动就被取消说话权

    石洞村是“十家民主”
    干部一窝蜂报复群众
    贫雇动不动就被取消说话权
    【本报消息】武安九区石洞村的工作员，经过初步调查，了解到这村贫雇的翻身还相当不彻底；干部多占果实，对群众压制的很厉害；有的老财还当着干部，被村干部包庇着没斗。
    这村的贫雇，多半靠种山地、做木工过时光。抗战以后，段家的上层人物，比方段炳南（过去群众认为他是封建富农，才撤职不久的政治主任）、段来有（农会主任）、段永和（过去的村长）等，轮流掌握村政权。贫雇、木工被他们压制着，土地改革当中，没有得到多少果实。根据三十二户贫雇的调查，里面有二十六户的果实分数都在六分以下。小三在外面种山地才回来，只给评了两分。合作社经理张文斌（抗属），群众过去认为他是封建富农，却评了十二分。在土地质量上，贫雇的地，没法和干部比；就是数量上还差不多。（这村共有二十二顷地，二百三十多户，七百来口人，每人平均三亩多地。）现在有的贫雇马上就没有粮食吃。象土金，年前只剩下二斗玉茭，三十多斤米，还欠人家四十二斤麦子（缴公粮借了一些），七十六斤米。
    提到干部情况，贫农英会娘说：石洞是“十家民主”。就是说，全村只有几个主要干部当家包办胡作乱为。段炳南霸占了贫农段永林的三亩地，直到他被撤职才退出来，又是退给了农会。段炳南还霸占了贫农段祥华的房子。逼的段祥华哭了一夜，才无可奈何的搬了家。村干部规定老光棍、老寡妇如果不是抗属就不照顾。理由是他们活不了几年，多分了东西留给谁？对手艺人，不管他能不能维持家庭生活，都是少定分。干部们却要多定分，理由是他们办工作误了工。这样干部多占果实，偷盗果实就很严重。为了反对干部多占果实，有的贫农受了干部很重的打击。退伍军人段春林（贫农）看到果实分配不公，在抗属会上提意见。结果叫村干部取消了他两个月的发言权，还把他原来得的十分果实撤回去。后来区干部提了意见，才又补给他七分。村干部给英会娘定了两分，她嫌少。农会委员张西秀说：“嫌少！下他个吉巴的！”村干部干脆不给她了。后来别人劝说着才给了一分。以后分果实，就把她降到五等一级。群众说：“给多少算多少，要是提意见，就连这点果实也没有了。”
