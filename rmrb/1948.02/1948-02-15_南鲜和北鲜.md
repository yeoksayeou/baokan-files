Which way will the Eastern nations lean, towards the United States or towards the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union? The behavior of both sides in Korea can answer this question. During World War II, the Korean people had some illusions about the US military. However, these illusions were shattered from the day the US military entered Korea. After the collapse of Japan, the Korean people revolted, driving out the Japanese local officials and establishing their own municipal councils and national legislative organizations. But the US military, finding that the liberation work had already been completed by the Koreans themselves, felt that it did not conform to the established "instructions". Therefore, the commander resolutely demanded the restoration of the original situation, drove the Koreans out, and recalled the Japanese to work under American command. This was the first of a series of painful experiences for the Korean people, which led to their contempt for the United States. Those Koreans who had worked under the Japanese in the past were still employed, while anti-fascist Koreans were refused employment, which aroused the contempt and hatred of the Korean people towards the United States!

When the Soviet army entered northern Korea, the Japanese had already been expelled from the government offices, and the Koreans had entered. Moreover, the Soviet Union handed over the real power to the Korean local organizations and the National Assembly. The Koreans in North Korea felt that they were managing their own affairs, so they felt that the various people's organizations were politically reliable.

Now, agriculture in South Korea is even less prosperous than it was under feudalism. The Korean National Assembly has requested the implementation of land redistribution, but this has been rejected by the United States. Several Japanese landlords have been confiscated by the US military, but this makes no difference to the farmers. They now have to pay equal rents to the United States (from one-third to one-half of the harvest). It's just a change of landlords.

Comparing the situation in these two regions: In South Korea, under the control of the US military, there is unemployment, and farmers still bear a heavier burden than they did under feudalism. In North Korea, under the Soviet army, everyone has a job, and farmers have their own land.

Although South Korea is a rice-producing area, the military government established by the US military collects excessive grain, leading to high rice prices and difficult living conditions, so there is dissatisfaction with the political status quo. On September 25, 1946, a general strike of 40,000 railway workers broke out in South Korea. Democratic youth and patriotic students in South Korea also rose up to respond and assist. At that time, 500,000 workers, peasants, and students participated in the action in various parts of South Korea. The fuse of the railway strike was the military government's order to restrict travel and the transportation and sale of rice. The salaries of railway workers were already very low, and some had to travel back and forth to sell rice to supplement their families. After the government order was issued, feelings of grief and disappointment suddenly erupted. The US military brutally suppressed the workers, creating a bloody incident. This tragedy was the largest in Korean history, so the people of South Korea fell into even greater hatred and contempt for the military government and the US military.

The factories in North Korea, except for a few metal factories, have all started production. The following is a general overview of the production of the five major factories in the north:

(1) Sup'ung Hydroelectric Power Plant – There are four generators in total.

(2) Chongsu Nitrogen Chemical Factory – This factory is the most modern in the Far East, with a monthly output of 3,000 tons.

(3) Pukchong Light Metal Factory – Before Japan's surrender, the production volume only reached 70% of the original production capacity. By March 1946, the production volume had reached 85%.

(4) Pyongyang Jipon Agricultural Production Company – Mass production of corn starch and corn oil.

(5) Haeju ×× Steel Plant – One of the important factories in the north, with extremely high productivity, manufacturing agricultural machinery, machines, steel rails, etc.

In addition to the above factories, dozens of others have started production.

The factories in the north used to be dominated by Japanese financial groups, but now they belong to the North Korean Provisional People's Committee. Its productivity has been improved. The reason for the improvement is the adoption of democratic principles, an eight-hour workday, and enthusiastic work to strive for the establishment of an independent new Korea. Workers and administrative staff in the factory receive equal pay. The factory supervisors are promoted from the ranks of the workers. The workers have a great say in the work through their own organizations. Many senior administrative staff in the factory are former revolutionaries. The only shortage in industrial development and revival is technical talent. Craft schools have now been widely established to cultivate talent.

Comparing the north and south regions of Korea, there is truly a difference between hell and paradise.

    南鲜和北鲜
    东方民族靠近美国呢？还是靠近以苏联为首的民主阵营呢？看在朝鲜双方的表现就可以知道了。在二次大战中，朝鲜人民是曾对美军有过一些幻想的；可是，从美军进驻朝鲜的那一天起，这幻想就粉碎了。当日本瓦解后，朝鲜人就暴动了，把日本的地方官吏赶走，设立起自己的市政会议和国家的立法组织。而美军发现解放工作已由朝鲜人自己完成了，觉得不符合既定的“指令”，所以指挥官坚决要求恢复当初的情况，把朝鲜人赶出去，又把日本人召回在美国的指挥下工作起来。这是朝鲜人所受的一连串痛苦经验的第一件，也就是使朝鲜人对美国卑视。朝鲜人以往在日本手下作过事的仍然任用，而反法西斯的朝鲜人却被拒绝任用，这就招致了朝鲜人对美国的卑视与仇恨！
    当苏军进驻朝鲜北部时，日本人已经被逐出官厅，朝鲜人也进去了，而且苏联把实权交给朝鲜人的地方组织和国会，在北鲜的朝鲜人觉得是在自己人管理自己事，所以感到各种人民组织在政治上是可信赖的。
    现在南鲜的农业还不如封建制度存在时的繁荣了，朝鲜国民议会会请求实行土地重新分配，可是遭到了美国的拒绝，有几个日本地主被美军没收了，但这对于农民没有两样，他们现在也要缴纳相等的地租给美国（从三分之一至二分之一的收获量），这不过是换换地主而已。
    把这南北两区的情形比较一下：在美军管制的南鲜，失业，而且农民仍然负担重过封建制度的生活；在苏军的北鲜，人人有工作做，而且农民都有自己的土地。
    南鲜虽然是产米区域，然而美军所设的军政府征粮过多，致米价高涨，民生困窘，所以对政治现状不满。在四六年九月二十五日，南鲜就发生了四万铁路工人的总罢工，民主青年与南鲜爱国学生也起而响应与援助，当时南鲜各地参加行动的工农学生达五十万人。铁路罢工的导火线，是军政府下令限制旅行，限制米谷运销，铁路工人薪俸本极微薄，有些人要往来贩米以补家用。待政府令下后，悲愤失望的情绪猛然爆发。美军则对工人横暴镇压，制造流血事件。这一次的惨案是朝鲜有史以来最大的，因此南鲜的人民对于军政府及美军，就愈陷于仇恨和卑视了。
    北鲜的工厂，除了少数金属工厂之外，都开工生产了，下面是北部五个大工厂的生产的大概情形：
    （一）水丰水力发电厂——共有发电机四部。
    （二）青水氮气化学工厂——这工厂是远东最新式的，每月产量三千吨。
    （三）北青轻金属工厂——在日本投降以前，生产量只达原生产能力百分之七十，至一九四六年三月，生产量就已达到百分之八十五。
    （四）平壤ＪＩｐｏｎ农业生产公司——大量制造玉蜀黍淀粉和玉蜀黍油。
    （五）在海州的××炼钢厂——是北部重要工厂之一，生产率极高，制造农用器械、机器、钢轨等等。
    除以上各工厂外，开工的还有数十家。
    北部的工厂以往都受日本财阀的支配，现在是属北鲜临时人民委员会，其生产率已提高，提高的原因是采用了民主原则，一天工作八小时，以及工作热心，争取建立独立新朝鲜之故。厂中工人与行政人员薪水平等，工厂的监督们是由工人层中提补的，工人们通过自己的组织对工作进行上有很大的决定作用，许多工厂高级行政人员，是以往的革命分子。在工业发展与复兴上就是缺少技术人才，目前已普遍成立工艺学校培养人才。
    就朝鲜南北两区来比较一下，真有地狱与天堂之别。
