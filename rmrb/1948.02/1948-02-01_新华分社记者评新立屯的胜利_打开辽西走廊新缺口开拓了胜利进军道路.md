Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th. A branch reporter commenting on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's 26th Division stated: Just as Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in the Northeast battlefield were changing commanders for the third time, and bandit chieftain Wei Lihuang had just taken office, our Northeast People's Liberation Army gave him a resounding blow, capturing Xinlitun, a strategic town and railway junction west of Shenyang, and completely annihilating the bandit army's 26th Division. This was indeed a head-on blow to the bandit Wei Lihuang, who was "trying to restore the advantage in Manchuria" and "expressing pessimism." This time, our army, with concentrated forces, braved the rare severe cold in Guanwai (the Northeast), and conducted continuous large-scale winter operations. In just two engagements, we annihilated three entire enemy divisions. Bandit chieftain Chen Cheng, who had wildly claimed that he would "restore the Northeast's advantage in six months," was also kicked off the stage as a result. What followed was Wei Lihuang's "taking command" and the so-called Fan Hanjie's army being transferred from Shandong to reinforce the defense of the Ji-Re-Liao Corridor. However, all these desperate struggles by the bandits appeared only to expose their inadequacy and embarrassment in the face of the powerful People's Liberation Army. The victory at Xinlitun was a heavy blow to this strategic deployment of the Chen-Wei bandit gang. From then on, not only was a gap opened again in their already severed Liaoxi Corridor, pioneering the road for our army's victorious advance, but also the western gateway to Shenyang was greatly opened, and the satellite strongholds of the enemy's nest in Shenyang were also weakened day by day. It can be seen that in the face of the invincible People's Army, the bandit chiefs and principal culprits who are loyal to Chiang Kai-shek, whether it is Du Yuming, Chen Cheng, or Wei Lihuang, Fan Hanjie, their inevitable fate of failure is undoubtedly doomed, and this truth has once again been confirmed in the victory at Xinlitun.

In particular, in this battle of Xinlitun, as soon as our army cleared the periphery, the bandit army, which had concentrated a division to defend the key point, abandoned the city and fled in panic. This shows the enemy's fear and demoralization. Compared with the previous Zhangwu campaign and Gongzhuling campaign a month ago, it further shows the dead end of the Northeast bandit army. In the battle of Zhangwu, our army cleared the periphery in two days and resolved the city attack in five hours, completely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 79th Division that was stubbornly defending the city. In the battle of Gongzhuling, our army annihilated the bandit's 195th and 43rd entire divisions and the New 5th Army headquarters, and blocked the ten enemy divisions coming to the rescue in fifty-four hours of fierce fighting. In this battle of Xinlitun, our army cleared the periphery in one day, and the bandit army abandoned its heavily fortified strongholds and fled in panic. In several hours of street fighting and pursuit, the entire division of bandit troops was completely annihilated. This battle example fully illustrates the situation that the Northeast bandit army is bound to be defeated in every battle today. Whether it "defends," reinforces, or flees, its only fate is complete annihilation. This obvious trend has further increased our infinite confidence and courage in the task of completely eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the Northeast.

At the same time, the annihilation of the bandit army's 26th Division once again exposed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's conspiracy to send miscellaneous troops to their deaths. Since our army's summer offensive, the two former Northeast Army units that were transferred to the Northeast by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have been placed in the position of taking the lead in the attack. The 116th Division of the 53rd Army was annihilated at Weiyuanbao, and its 130th Division had one of its regiments annihilated. The main force of the 79th and 105th Divisions of the 49th Army was annihilated in the battle of Yangzhangzi, west of Liaoning, and the designation of the 105th Division was crossed out by Chiang Kai-shek. In the battle of Zhangwu, the 79th Division was annihilated again. With the annihilation of the 26th Division this time, the entire 49th Army, except for a wandering headquarters, was completely finished. What is most vicious is that when the bandit's 26th Division was surrounded this time, the Chen and Wei bandits never sent a single soldier to assist, which was completely different from the situation in which ten divisions were quickly sent to assist when the bandit's 195th and 43rd divisions were annihilated previously. We once again warn those miscellaneous troops who are wielding weapons and selling their lives for Chiang Kai-shek to remember this lesson, lay down their weapons as soon as possible, and return to the people. Do not wait until the People's Liberation Army arrives to repeat the mistakes of the 26th Division.

    新华分社记者评新立屯的胜利
    打开辽西走廊新缺口开拓了胜利进军道路
    【新华社东北三十日电】分社记者评蒋匪二十六师的覆灭称：当东北战场蒋匪三易主帅，匪首卫立煌刚刚到任之时，我东北人民解放军就给他一个下马威，攻克沈（阳）西战略要镇铁路交叉点新立屯，全部歼灭匪军二十六师，这对于“恢复在满洲的优势”“表示悲观”的卫匪立煌，的确是当头一棒。此次我军以集中的兵力，冒关外稀有的奇寒，进行连续大规模的冬季作战，才两个回合，就歼敌三个整师，而狂言“六个月恢复东北优势”的匪首陈诚，也因此被撵下将台。继之而来的就是卫立煌的“登台挂帅”和所谓范汉杰兵团由山东挖肉补疮，前来增援，守卫冀热辽走廊。然而匪徒们这一切垂死挣扎，在强大的人民解放军面前，却只是显得其捉襟见肘，狼狈周章。新立屯战役的胜利，就是给陈、卫匪帮的这一战略部署以沉重一击，从此不仅其已告斩断的辽西走廊又被打开一个缺口，开拓了我军胜利进军的道路，而且沈西门户也大为洞开，敌巢沈阳的卫星据点，也日见削弱。由此可见，在无敌的人民军队面前，替蒋贼效忠卖命的匪首元凶，不管它是杜聿明、陈诚也好、或是卫立煌、范汉杰也好，其必然失败的命运已经注定无疑，这个真理又一次的在新立屯的胜利中得了印证。
    特别是这次新立屯战斗，我军刚一扫清外围，以一个师集结守卫重点的匪军，就弃城狼狈逃命，这可见敌军胆寒心悸，士气颓丧的情况。如和前次一个月来的彰武战役、公主屯战役相较，更显出东北匪军的穷途末路；彰武之战，我军以两天时间肃清外围，五小时解决攻城战斗，全歼坚守该城的蒋匪七十九师，公主屯之战，我军以五十四小时激战，歼灭出援新民之匪一九五、四十三两个整师和新五军军部，并阻击应援之匪十个师；而这次新立屯战斗，我军在一天之内扫清了外围，匪军即放弃其坚固设防据点，狼狈奔逃，于数小时巷战及捕捉战中，整师匪军就全部覆没。这一战例，充分说明了今日东北匪军每战必败的情况，不管它“坚守”也好，增援也好，逃跑也好，其唯一的命运就只有全部覆没。这个明显的趋势对于我军全部消灭东北境内蒋匪的任务，也就更增加了无限的信心和勇气。
    同时，这次匪军二十六师的歼灭，又一次暴露了蒋匪帮拿杂牌送死的阴谋手段。自我军夏季攻势后，被蒋匪调来东北的两个旧东北军的部队，一直放在打头阵的地位；五十三军的一一六师在威远堡门被歼灭了，其一三○师则被歼一个团。四十九军的七十九师、一○五师主力在辽西杨仗子一役被歼，一○五师的番号就此被蒋贼一笔勾销，彰武一战七十九师再告歼灭，到这次二十六师的覆灭，整个四十九军除剩下一个流亡的光杆军部外，就此全部完结。而最毒辣的是当此次匪二十六师被围时，陈、卫诸匪始终不派一兵一卒应援，于前此之匪一九五、四三两师被歼时以十个师迅速赴援情形迥然两样。我们再次警告那些手执武器，替蒋贼卖命的杂牌军，记取这一教训，趁早放下武器，归依人民，莫要等到解放军大军降临之时，再蹈二十六师的覆辙。
