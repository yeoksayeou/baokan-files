Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th: Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in various parts of Shandong are frantically drafting and conscripting, attempting to replenish their insufficient forces and the large number of desertions. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yantai stipulated that all citizens aged eighteen to thirty-four must be drafted into the army. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Weixian stipulated the conscription of 10,000 men, and even the Dejuzhidong firm in the city had fifteen people taken away. Wang Hongjiu, the eighth district commissioner of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Linyi, ordered the conscription of 10,000 men, often sending armed forces to surround markets to seize laborers, or launching dawn raids on villages to arrest people. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Zaozhuang, Yixian County, stipulated that each Bao (group of households) must provide twelve draftees, and for each missing draftee, 5 million yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency must be paid. For those without draftees who own land, they must pay 150 million yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency per mu (unit of area), 20 jin (unit of weight) of sorghum, 5 jin of wheat, and 2,000 yuan for opium expenses. These atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have aroused anger and resistance from the masses. In a village in Tancheng with more than 300 people, in a district in Linyi with more than 100 people, and in more than 20 villages in the Yuhuian guerrilla area, people have organized guerrilla teams or anti-conscription brigades, attacking Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops everywhere and launching anti-conscription struggles.

    鲁南群众反抗蒋匪
    组织反抓丁大队
    【新华社华东二十九日电】山东各地蒋匪近疯狂抽丁抓丁，企图补充兵力不足和大批逃亡的缺额。烟台蒋匪规定，凡年在十八到三十四岁的市民，都要抽去当兵。潍县蒋匪规定抽丁一万名，城内德聚东商号一家就被拉走十五人。临沂蒋匪八区专员王洪九下令抓丁一万名，常派出武装包围集市拉夫，或拂晓突击村子抓捕。峄县枣庄蒋匪规定每保出丁十二名，没丁每名出蒋币五百万元，没丁有地的每亩交蒋币一万五千万、高粱二十斤、小麦五斤、洋烟费二千元。蒋匪这种暴行，激起群众愤怒和反抗。郯城某村有三百多人，临沂某区一百多人，和沭河岸游击区二十多村群众，都组织了游击队或反抓丁大队，到处打击蒋伪，展开反抓丁斗争。
