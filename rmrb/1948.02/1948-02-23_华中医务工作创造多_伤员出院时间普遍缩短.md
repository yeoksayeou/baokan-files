Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: Medical workers of a certain unit of the Central China Field Army have overcome various difficulties, including the severe blockade by the Chiang bandits and frequent "sweeping up" operations, as well as the lack of medical equipment over the past year, creating various methods to treat wounded soldiers, achieving excellent results: (1) Successful experimentation with blood transfusion devices. Last summer, when medicine and equipment were extremely scarce, wounded soldiers with excessive blood loss often lacked injections of physiological saline. They wanted to perform blood transfusions but lacked the necessary equipment. Utilizing available materials, medical personnel created a scientific blood transfusion device through five experiments, enabling large-scale blood transfusions. Each medical team now has a blood transfusion device. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of blood transfused in the past six months has exceeded 10,000 cc, with each severely wounded soldier receiving an average of 200 to 300 cc of fresh blood, saving many critically ill soldiers. (2) Invention of the Yang's Splint. Comrade Yang Zhong, Minister of Health, carefully researched and created the Yang's Splint, which has a hole in the middle, the size of the bone, that can be opened and closed. During amputation surgery, the splint is slipped over the cut muscle to replace the surgical towel or gauze, avoiding the phenomenon of fibers from the gauze surgical towel entering the periosteum or muscle, causing inflammation and suppuration, while also increasing the speed of surgery by a quarter of the time. (3) Creation of fracture beds. Comrade Shi Zhiyang, a section chief, created a fracture bed, which allows fracture patients to be changed without turning, saving change time and minimizing post-operative deformities. (4) Using cellophane (the transparent paper used to wrap cigarette boxes) for drainage is suitable for new tissues, more economical than rubber strip drainage, and more scientific than gauze strip drainage. (5) Widespread use of protective covers to reduce external pressure on wounds and promote rapid growth of new tissues. (6) Dry dressing (dry gauze) therapy, with strict disinfection, places dry dressing on the wound to allow it to heal naturally, abandoning the old, unscientific, and uneconomical theory of applying oil-based preparations. (7) Adhesive bandage. When the wound is clean and has little secretion, adhesive bandages are used to pull it together, achieving significant results in shortening the healing period. (8) Improved first aid work. Companies emphasize the mass line in battlefield first aid, organizing health soldiers and regularly teaching them battlefield first aid and hygiene knowledge. Seventy-five percent of the wounded on the battlefield are given first aid by health soldiers. After scientific division of labor at the transfer station, an estimated 130 or more wounded soldiers can be processed every hour. Each operating table can perform more than 30 major surgeries within 24 hours, so most wounded soldiers can have surgery completed before inflammation occurs. One wounded soldier had his stomach and intestines broken, and another wounded soldier had three holes in his intestines. Their lives were saved because surgery was performed within six to twelve hours after being wounded. Because of the above creations, the average hospital stay for wounded soldiers has been shortened to within 40 days.

　　华中医务工作创造多
  　伤员出院时间普遍缩短
    【新华社华东前线二十一日电】华中野战军某部医务工作者，一年来，克服蒋匪严密封锁和频繁"扫荡"下，医药器材缺乏的诸种困难，创造了各种办法，治疗伤员，成绩极佳：（一）输血器之试验成功。去年夏天，医药奇缺，流血过多的伤员，往往缺乏生理食盐水的注射，想输血又没有输血器，就利用器材，医务人员经五次试验而造成一种科学的输血器，大量输血因得以进行。现每个医疗队有一输血器。据不完全统计，半年来输血总数在一万西西以上，平均每个重伤员得到二百到三百西西的鲜血，挽救了许多垂危的伤员。（二）杨氏护板的发明。卫生部长杨忠同志悉心研究，创造了杨氏护板，即板中间穿一与骨骼大小相当的洞，可以开合，行切断手术时，将板套进切断的肌肉，以代替治疗巾或纱布，并避免了过去纱布治疗巾的纤维套进骨衣或肌肉，而引起发炎化脓的现象，同时增加了手术速度四分之一的时间。（三）创造了骨折床。某室长施志杨同志，创造骨折床，使骨拆病人，换药时就不需要转动，节省了换药时间，并使愈后的畸形减至最低限度。（四）用玻璃纸（香烟盒上包制用的透明纸）做引流，适用于新生的组织，比橡皮条引流经济，比纱布条引流科学。（五）普遍的采用护罩，减少伤口的外部压力，使新生组织迅速生长。（六）干敷（干纱布）疗法，消毒严密，干敷料放在伤口上，使伤口自然愈合，扬弃了过去敷油制剂不科学不节约的旧学说。（七）结胶布。在伤口清洁分泌少的时候，用胶布拉拢，在缩短愈合期上，收到显著的效果。（八）急救工作提高。连队重视了战场急救的群众路线，组织了卫生战士，经常教以战场急救及卫生常识。战场上百分之七十五的伤员，是由卫生战士急救的。而转运站经科学的分工后，计每个钟头能处理一百三十个以上的伤员。每张手术台，在二十四小时内，能施行三十个以上的重伤手术，因之大部伤员都能在发炎前期完成手术疗法。一伤员肠胃打破另一伤员肠子穿了三个洞，都由于在负伤后六小时至十二小时内施行手术，生命得到挽救。由于上述创造，使伤员出院的时间，平均缩短到四十天以内。
