　　Endured All Hardships, Herding Sheep All His Life
    ——A Brief Biography of Old Shepherd Zhang Baozhu
    The shepherd Zhang Baozhu is fifty-seven years old this year. He is from Shidong Village, Wu'an. From a very young age, he was so poor that he had nothing. He herded sheep for others all his life. After the War of Resistance, he finally accumulated some money and bought three mu of land and a dilapidated house. However, even now, he is still looked down upon and still oppressed by some bad village cadres. The following is his experience of more than fifty years:
    When his father was alive, he didn't have any land at all. His father was very hardworking, herding sheep for others. Later, when he got old, he became addicted to opium, which ruined his health, and no one hired him anymore. Later, he wandered around begging in the west and died of illness in Tongyi Village.
    Baozhu's mother died right after he was born, and he was raised in his maternal grandmother's home. At that time, there were four people in his maternal grandmother's family, with seven or eight mu of land. They could barely make ends meet by eating bran and wild vegetables. When Baozhu grew to be seven or eight years old, his maternal grandmother's family also fell on hard times. Baozhu returned to his village to beg for food, but he couldn't get enough to eat every day, so he went back to his maternal grandmother's home. His maternal grandmother came up with a plan for him, telling him to go to Wu'an city to herd sheep. He started herding sheep for a butcher shop owned by a family named Han, with an annual salary of a little over one string of cash. From then on, he herded sheep for others. He herded in Wu'an city for two years, and then went to the earth mountain to herd for another family. He herded on the earth mountain for four years, earning only twelve strings of cash. He returned to his hometown, Shidong, but couldn't find work, so he helped this wealthy man for a few days and helped that wealthy man for a few days, exchanging it for a bowl of rice to pass the time. This was not a sustainable way to live, so later he herded sheep for the old Zhishan family, without any wages, just food and clothing. In the fourth month of that year, a sheep fell off a cliff and died. Baozhu returned and was tied to a tree by old Zhishan and severely beaten with a shepherd's whip. After being beaten, Baozhu was afraid that old Zhishan would break off relations with him, so he secretly ran away. He ran to Songjiang Rock and herded sheep for a wealthy man named Wang, earning only two strings of cash a year. He continued to herd for five or six years, and then went to Wanbei City for more than a year. At that time, the wages were too low, not even enough to buy clothes, so he returned to Shidong, still helping this family for a few days and that family for a few days. When he was twenty years old, he couldn't stand it at home, so he fled to Xijing, Licheng, to herd sheep for others. He earned thirty silver dollars a year. He herded in Xijing for twelve years, and then went to Xiaozhai Village for three years. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he returned home and herded sheep in the Tonghui and Haozhuang areas. It wasn't until last winter that he stopped herding sheep.
    Last year, he used the wages he earned, 15,000 yuan, to buy two mu and two fen of land. The year before last, he used 360 yuan to buy a dilapidated house. Adding the mu or so of land he bought in the previous years, he had a total of more than three mu.
    During the land reform, he was given a share of the fruit money to buy two broken sedan chairs, a vat, a door curtain, a kang table, four pieces of clothing (all in red and green, none of which could be worn), a cloth bag, and a broken bundle cloth. He had to buy them, as this was decided by the village cadres, and no one could choose.
    He said: "In the past, when people talked about suffering, they didn't include shepherding. They always said that shepherding was an easy job that didn't require much effort. They didn't know that the suffering endured by shepherds was the greatest! Regardless of wind or rain, people and sheep suffered together on the mountain. During the day when it rained, the sheep had to be driven back, for fear of rotting the wool. At night when it rained, they had to be driven out, for fear of rotting the sheep's hooves. Alas! It's not a good business! That year, when I was herding sheep in the village, two sheep ate a few mouthfuls of millet from Zhang Hongsheng's field. He hit me with a stick as thick as a fist. After hitting me, he wasn't finished, and kicked me down the cliff, saying it was not enough to have kicked your little wife's nephew to death! Both of my legs were unable to move, and I was lucky that the neighbors carried me back."
    He said: "The times have changed, and people say that the poor are going to be the masters! I thought to myself: What masters? It's enough not to suffer or be bullied. Who knew that we still suffer. That year, they asked me to herd sheep for the village office, giving me one jin of rice a day, which I thought was too little. Later, they agreed that I would get a share of the sheep dung, and the village cadres also agreed. Later, when the dung was divided, the village chief, Duan Yonghe, wouldn't let me have it and sold it all himself. He's the village chief, so I didn't dare to say anything. They gave me a share of the food (fruit), and I was unhappy, so at the general meeting, the village cadres said that anyone who had any opinions should raise them. I thought I would raise it! So I said: Comrades, take a look, is my share more or less? If it's more, reduce it a bit more. Before I could finish a sentence, Bingnan's father pointed at me and said that I was disrupting the meeting and wanted to get me up, which scared me so much that I didn't dare to speak anymore. When they call me to a meeting, I go, and if they don't call me, I don't go. I don't dare to offer many opinions, because they retaliate severely." (Written by Zhu Bo)

　　吃尽苦中苦  放羊一辈子
    ——老羊工张保柱小传
    羊工张保柱，今年五十七岁。武安石洞村人。从很小就穷的什么都没有。给人家放了一辈子羊。抗战以后，他才积蓄了几个钱，买了三亩多地，一处破房子。但是，直到现在，他仍然被人瞧不起，仍然受着一些坏村干的压制。下面是他五十多年的经历：
    他爹在的时候，就没有一点土地了。他爹很能受苦，给人家放羊。后来年纪大了，吸上大烟，把身体吸坏了，再也没有人用了。后来流落在西边要饭吃，在同义村病死了。
    保柱刚刚生下来，他娘就死了，在姥姥家养着他。那时候他姥姥家共四口人，有七、八亩地，吃糠咽菜，还能顾住嘴。保柱长到七、八岁，他姥姥家的时光也不行了。保柱回到本村要饭吃，每天要不饱，又回到他姥姥家。他姥姥给他想了个办法，叫他到武安城去放羊。开始给一家姓韩的肉房里放羊，一年工资是一吊多钱。从此以后就一直给人家放羊。在武安城放了二年，又到土山上给另一家放。在土山上放了四年，才挣了十二吊钱。回到老家石洞，找不着活干，就给这个老财帮几天忙，给那家有法的帮几天忙，换碗饭来过时光。这样受下去不是办法，后来就给老致善家放羊，不给工线，光管吃管穿。那年四月里，一个羊跌到崖下跌死了。保柱回来，被老致善捆在树上，用放羊的鞭子痛打一顿。保柱挨了打，还怕老致善和他不完，就偷偷的跑了。跑到宋江岩，给一家姓王的老财放羊，一年才挣两吊钱。一直又放了五、六年，以后又到宛北城放了一年多。那时候工价太少，还不够穿衣服，就又回到石洞，仍然是给这家受几天，给那家受几天。二十岁的时候，在家实在站不住了，逃到黎城西井给人家放羊。一年挣三十块现洋。在西井放了十二年，又到小砦村放了三年。民国十一年又回了家，到同会、郝庄一带放羊。一直到去年冬天才算不放羊了。
    去年他用挣的工资一万五千元，买了二亩二分地。大前年用三百六十元买了一处破房子，加上头几年买的亩把地，一共有了三亩多。
    土地改革中，分给他一份果实钱，买了两顶破轿，一个缸，一个门帘，一个炕桌，四件衣服（都是红的绿的一件也不能穿），一个布袋，一个破包袱皮。不买不行，这是村干部订好的，谁也不能挑选。
    他说："过去人们说起受苦的人，就不连着放羊的。都是说放羊这个活用不着卖力气。他们那知道，放羊人受的苦顶大呀！不管刮风下雨，人和羊一块在山上受着。白天下雨，要把羊赶回来，怕沤了羊毛。夜里下雨，要赶出来，怕烂羊蹄子。唉！可不是好营生啊！那年在本村里放羊，有两个羊吃了张洪生家几嘴谷子，人家拿拳头粗的棍子打我，打完了还不算完，一脚把我踢在崖下边，说摔死你个小妻侄还少你哩！打的我两条腿都不能动啦，多亏邻家把我抬回来。"
    他说：事变了，人们说穷人要当家哩！我心里就想：当啥家呀！不受罪不受气就行了。谁知道还是受气。那年叫我给村公所放羊，一天给一斤米，我嫌少。后来说好，羊粪有我的一股，村干部也答应了。后来分粪，村长段永和不叫我要了，粪都叫他给卖了。人家是村长，咱没有敢吭气。分火食（果实），分给我一份，我心眼不高兴，在大会场上，村干部说谁有啥意见谁就提。我心想提提吧！我就说：群众们，看看我这一份多呀还是少？多就再减一减。一句话没说完，人家炳南爹就指着我，说我是搞乱会场，要把我弄起来，吓的咱再也不敢说话了。开会时叫去就去，不叫去就算，意见多不敢提，他们报复的厉害。（朱波代笔）
