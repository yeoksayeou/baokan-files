Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for
  Correct Interpretation of "Equal Distribution," Immediately Begin Spring Plowing
    [Taihang News] The spring plowing season has arrived, but in many villages, farmers misunderstand "equal distribution" to mean "disruptive equal distribution," fearing wasted labor and losses, so they are unwilling to start work, waiting until after the distribution. Therefore, the Taihang Xinhua Daily specially calls on all farmers in the region to quickly organize the delivery of manure and repair the land. The article first points out that the "equal distribution" mentioned in the Land Law Outline does not mean disruptive equal distribution, but rather drawing from fertile to supplement barren, and drawing from surplus to supplement deficit. It then points out that some villages in our region, after years of emancipation movements, have seen many hired laborers or the majority of hired laborers, roughly achieving the village's average acreage and average grain yield. This time, the distribution of land will use the method of drawing and supplementing to level out the discrepancies, allowing hired laborers who have not been fully emancipated to reach the village's average acreage and average grain yield; therefore, the land will not only not be disruptively redistributed, but the changes will also not be very significant. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will dispel the misunderstanding of "disruptive equal distribution." Finally, it points out that spring is early this year, and the "Rain Water" solar term has already arrived. If manure is not delivered and land is not repaired quickly to prepare for spring plowing, it will definitely affect this year's production. If production is poor, it is oneself who will suffer. Therefore, we suggest that the masses be quickly organized to deliver manure, repair land, and prepare for spring plowing. Landlords and rich peasants must also be made to apply manure well and repair the land well.

　　太行新华日报号召
  　正确解释“平分”  立即着手春耕
    【太行消息】春耕季节已到，但有不少村庄的农民，因对“平分”误解是“打乱平分”，怕白误工又赔本，所以都不愿意动工，等平分后再说。为此太行新华日报特号召全区农民应赶快组织送粪、修地。该文首先指出：土地法大纲所说的平分，它的办法不是打乱平分，而是抽肥补瘦、抽多补少。接着指出：我区有些村庄经过历年翻身运动，很多雇贫或者大部分雇贫，在土地上大体已达到了全村的平均亩数和平均产粮，这次平分土地，就是用抽补的办法来填平补齐，让没翻透身的雇贫，达到全村平均亩数和平均产粮就行；所以土地不但不打乱平分，而且变动也不会很大。所以希望大家取消“打乱平分”的误解。最后指出：今年春浅，目前已到“雨水”节，如不赶快送粪、修地等准备春耕，定要影响今年生产。生产不好，吃亏的还是自己。所以我们建议，要赶快组织群众送粪、修地，准备春耕工作。地主富农也一定要他把粪上好、地修好。
