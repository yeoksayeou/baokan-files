Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Paris dispatch: The French reactionary authorities illegally arrested Quan Gutang, head of the Viet Minh delegation to France, last month on the 29th. French Interior Minister Moch also ordered attacks on Vietnamese residential areas in the Haute-Pyrénées and Yerres, and massively arrested Vietnamese residents. This action has aroused the righteous indignation of the working people of France. The Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party issued a strong protest statement on the 6th, angrily condemning the French authorities' move as "a deliberate infringement of the rights of the Vietnamese people, instigated by the US representative Bullitt." The statement declared: "The French working people demand the immediate release of Quan Gutang and all Vietnamese working people detained in concentration camps." The statement also denounced the French authorities for "carrying out a bloody and unjust war against Vietnam." Large-scale protest demonstrations were held in Boron and Billancourt. Vietnamese workers in cities such as Limoges have launched strikes in solidarity with those arrested. According to TASS on the 6th, "The protest movement is now spreading throughout France."
