Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Jiang-controlled area newspapers report: Famous writers Guo Moruo and Mao Dun, unable to bear the oppression of the Chiang bandits, arrived in Hong Kong in mid-November of last year from Shanghai. At a welcome meeting held by cultural circles, Guo spoke about the U.S. imperialists' support for Japan's aggression against China and their cultural and ideological aggression, saying: "This kind of 'beauty' is the most vicious, most deeply exerted, and most beautifully disguised 'beauty.' It is not only 'beautifying' (colonizing) China, but also 'beautifying' Japan, using Japan to deal with us. Therefore, we must be vigilant against the danger of Japan and oppose the U.S. cultivation of Japan. Japan was originally a terrifying ghost, and behind this ghost stands another ghost (the United States), and in front of it are many more伥ghosts (referring to the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang). Japan must not be allowed to rise again." Referring to the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which recently prepared to publish a separate Hong Kong edition under the orders of the Chiang bandits, Guo compared the newspaper to the "painted skin" in "Liaozhai Zhiyi," clearly a "green-faced, fanged ghost" but using the guise of "civilian" to dress itself up as a "modern beauty." We must tear off its skin.

    郭沫若茅盾到香港
    痛斥美帝扶持日本侵华
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋区报纸消息：名作家郭沫若、茅盾不堪蒋匪压迫，已于年前十一月中旬由沪抵港。在文化界的欢迎会上，郭氏论到美帝国主义扶植日本侵略中国及其文化思想侵略时，他说：“这样的‘美’是用心最毒，用力最深，化装最美的‘美’。它不但在‘美化’（殖民地化）中国，还在‘美化’日本，用日本搞我们。所以要注意日本的危险，反对美国培植日本。日本本来是个可怕的鬼，这个鬼后面又站着一个鬼（美国），它前面还有不少伥鬼（指卖国贼蒋家匪帮），日本是不能让他起来的。”谈及奉蒋匪命令最近在香港筹备分版的大公报时，郭氏将该报比作“联斋志异”上的“画皮”，明明是一个“青面獠牙的鬼”，却用“民间”的招牌装成“摩登美女”。我们必须揭开它的皮来。
