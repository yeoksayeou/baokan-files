Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, January 31st: Under the call of General He Long to "wholeheartedly serve the wounded and sick," many moving stories and model figures have emerged among the staff of various hospitals here in the past six months. In a certain battle, many shells fell near the dressing station of Doctor Li Qingxi of the Third Battalion of the "Jinzhou" unit, but he was not afraid and continued to bandage the wounded. Finally, the road for transporting the wounded was cut off and the troops had already moved. However, there were still two wounded soldiers at the dressing station. Doctor Li resolutely rescued the wounded from danger, telling two young nurses to carry one person each and evacuate first. He carried one person on his back and evacuated last. The wounded soldier died on his back during the retreat. He used his hands to dig earth on the spot to bury him, and then rushed forward to rescue another wounded soldier. The soldiers all said that he "forgot himself when he saw the wounded." After the First Institute of the Second Field Hospital accepted its task from higher authorities, it marched 600 *li* continuously to reach its destination. All personnel, regardless of their marching fatigue, quickly set up a temporary hospital and launched a "laundry for the wounded" campaign, and all personnel in the institute were swept up in this upsurge. In order to save civilian labor, the institute did not use military porters when moving its station. The staff formed their own stretcher team, and the cooks had not slept for two nights to steam buns for the wounded. They even competed to carry stretchers when they set off. One night, Doctor Bian Qizeng of the First Rear Hospital went to many villages to change bandages for the wounded. He accidentally fell off a cliff in the dark and was injured, but he did not mention it to anyone. He continued to work as usual the next day, enduring the pain. Many other staff members also showed the same enthusiasm in caring for the suffering of the masses. Wang Hongrang, a poor peasant in Xue Village, Lishi, had been in labor for two days without delivering. His wife's life was in danger. The First Field Hospital immediately performed an operation to rescue her, ensuring the safety of both mother and child. The hospital staff cared for her day and night until she was discharged. The number of medical personnel who performed meritorious service in the Fifth Field Hospital alone reached seventy-nine.

    全心全意为伤病员服务
    晋绥涌现许多模范医务人员
    【新华社晋绥三十一日电】此间各医院工作人员在贺龙将军“全心全意为伤病员服务”的号召下，半年来出现许多可歌可泣的事例和模范人物。在某次战斗中，“津州”部三营医生李清兮的绷扎所附近落了很多炮弹，但他毫无惧色，仍为伤员包扎伤口，最后运送伤员的道路被截断，部队业已转移，但绷扎所还有两个伤员，李医生坚决抢救伤员出险，叫两个小护士共背一人，先撤退下去，自己背着一人最后撤退。撤退途中伤员死在他的背上，他使用两手就地掘土安埋，然后再跟上前去抢救另一伤员。战士们都说他“见了伤员忘了自己”。第二野战医院第一所接受上级任务后，连续行军六百里赶到目的地，全体人员不顾行军疲劳，迅速设立临时医院，发动“为伤员洗衣”运动，全所人员均卷入这一热潮。为节省民力，该所于转移驻地时，不动用军勤。工作人员自组担架队，炊事员为给伤员蒸馍，已两夜未眠，出发时还争抬担架。某夜第一后方医院医生边齐曾到许多村庄给伤员换绷带，在漆黑中失足堕崖受伤，但他不向任何人提及此事。次日忍痛照常工作。另有许多工作人员更以同样热情关切群众疾苦，离石薛村贫农王鸿让之妻生产两日不下，生命危殆，第一野战医院即为其开刀急救，母婴俱保安全，医院人员并日夜侍候，直至出院。仅第五野战医院立功之医务人员即达七十九人。
