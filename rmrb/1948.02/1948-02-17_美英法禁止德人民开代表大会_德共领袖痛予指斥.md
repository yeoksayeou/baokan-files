Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Berlin dispatch: The US, British, and French occupation authorities in Germany recently issued an order banning the convocation of a People's Congress in the western occupation zones. The Standing Committee of the German People's Congress submitted a protest to the western zone authorities and the Allied Control Council on the 7th, strongly condemning this ban as "violating the Potsdam Agreement which guarantees the German people basic democratic rights." The protest demanded the immediate cancellation of this illegal ban. Reimann, chairman of the Communist Party in the British occupation zone, pointed out at a mass meeting of 10,000 people in Düsseldorf that the prohibition of the People's Congress in the Anglo-American joint occupation zone was due to the enemies of German unity fearing the strength of the people's power. Reimann said with confidence: "But progressive forces will sweep away all obstacles." Grotewohl (formerly misreported as Grotewohl), one of the leaders of the Socialist Unity Party, also condemned Western imperialism for tearing up the Potsdam Agreement. He emphasized: "The German people do not need the union of two or three zones; the German people need a unified and peaceful Germany from south to north and from east to west. The voice of 70 million German people must be heeded."

    美英法禁止德人民开代表大会
    德共领袖痛予指斥
    【新华社陕北十一日电】柏林讯：德境美英法占领军当局，于日前颁布命令，禁止在西部占领区召开人民代表大会。德国人民代表大会常委会为此于七日向西占区当局及盟国管委会提出抗议书，力斥此项禁令“违反保证给德国人民以基本民主权利的波茨顿协定”。抗议书要求立即取消此项非法禁令。英占区共产党主席瑞曼在杜塞尔多夫万人群众大会上，指出英美联合占领区人民大会之遭到禁止，是由于德国统一的敌人害怕人民力量的强大所致。瑞曼充满信心的说：“但是进步力量将扫除一切障碍”。统一社会党领袖之一哥罗特瓦（前误为格罗提渥）亦痛斥西方帝国主义撕毁波茨顿协定。他强调指出：“德国人民不需要两区或三区的联合，德国人民需要的是一个从南到北从东到西的统一而和平的德国。七千万德国人民的这种呼声必须重视”。
