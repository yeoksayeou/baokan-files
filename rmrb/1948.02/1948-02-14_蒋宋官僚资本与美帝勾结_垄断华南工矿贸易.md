Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th: News from Chiang-controlled newspapers: The Chiang-Soong bureaucratic capital is colluding with American imperialism to actively monopolize South China's industry, mining, and trade. The Guangdong Provincial Industrial Company, which monopolizes the economy of Guangdong Province, has been accepted by the bandit Soong Tzu-wen. This company includes 187 factories, including the Shunde Sugar Factory, which earns 10 billion Chiang currency annually. Ge Jingzhong, the general manager of the Soong bandit China Sericulture Company, has been dispatched to Guangzhou to monopolize the province's silk industry. The Soong bandit China Construction Bank will soon establish a branch in Guangzhou to engage in the sugar and textile industries. The Soong bandit plans to transfer the textile and sugar factories originally operated by the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Company to this company. The Soong bandit-controlled Guangdong cement industry has already monopolized the South China cement market. Huang Xuchu, the Chiang bandit chairman of Guangxi Province, was also forced to open Guangxi, allowing Chiang-Soong bureaucratic capital to massively invade Guangxi's leather, sugar, cement, sulfuric acid, textile, iron, and paper industries, as well as the coal mines in Qianjiang and other places. The Chiang-Soong clique is also making every effort to expand the market for American goods in South China and monopolize South China's import and export trade. The original Guangzhou office of the Chiang bandit Import and Export Management Committee has now been expanded into the South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee. For example, South China's import quota for the third quarter of last year was 1,430,466 US dollars, an increase of 173,543 US dollars compared to the second quarter. At the same time, all import and export merchants in Guangzhou were forced to re-register. Of the more than 2,000 import and export merchants who applied for registration, only 14 tons of imported goods were approved, with the rest being monopolized by the Chiang-Soong clique. A large number of smuggled goods also openly enter South China under the protection of the Chiang-Soong and other bureaucratic capital. It is generally estimated that the total value of smuggled imports is about four to five times the value of goods taxed by the Guangdong Customs. Recently, Hong Kong also discovered an incident of Chiang bandit officials selling import permits, totaling as much as 1.5 million US dollars.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: A large number of factories and shops in Yantai have closed down due to the Chiang bandit's exorbitant taxes and cruel destruction. Of the more than 180 shops on Beida Street in Yantai, more than 30 have closed down, and 59 have posted notices saying "Shop for Sale." The famous Fuxing Iron Factory has also fallen into a state of shutdown. Two sock factories on Dong Taiping Street closed down because they could not afford the 2,500 jin of corn heavy tax forcibly levied by the Chiang bandits. The Yuliu Bank and Chaoyang and Haitong Banks on Beida Street were even sealed off by the Chiang bandit municipal party headquarters and naval headquarters under the pretext of "Communist Party" suspicion. Many shops have been converted into small stalls due to excessive losses, but small stall vendors still cannot escape the Chiang bandits' extortion. On the 26th of last month, the coastal defense camp forcibly extracted 40% of the "conscription donation" from the stall vendors who went to the market after an on-the-spot valuation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 10th: According to a magazine in the Chiang-controlled area: There were more than 200 silk stocking factories in Shanghai two years ago, but recently, due to American nylon stockings taking away more than two-thirds of the market, only 53 remain. Tin foil factories used for packaging cigarettes have also been invaded by American aluminum foil, and now there are only 18. The total monthly output of each factory is about 10,000 boxes. According to the Shanghai Tin Foil Industry's import statistics for the first eight months of last year, the cost of American aluminum foil (steel essence) consumed by each cigarette factory has reached 800 billion Chiang currency.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: According to foreign news agency reports from Shanghai: Taking advantage of the Chinese New Year, when private industrial and commercial families had difficulty in capital turnover, the four major families' banks stopped all loans on the one hand and bought up factory and shop inventories at low prices on the other, in order to hoard and speculate and sell at high prices. The Chiang bandit's Joint Treasury purchased up to 150 batches, worth 150 billion Chiang currency. Due to the shrinking purchasing power of citizens and the need for shop owners to repay debts, the prices of some commodities generally decreased by 10% on New Year's Eve, but business was worse than on the Gregorian New Year's Eve. At the same time, rice, which is most needed by the general public, has risen sharply.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 8th: According to Chiang-controlled newspapers: The four major families' monopoly capital is actively expanding to the Northwest. The Chiang bandit Northwest Minsheng Industrial Company has been officially relocated to Nanjing and has established branches in Shanghai, Lanzhou, and Dihua, owning 100 cars. The company's business plan includes four major sectors: agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, completely monopolizing the Northwest economy. Provincial-level monopoly institutions under the four major families' monopoly system are also actively operating. The Lanzhou Chiang bandit authorities will soon establish a "Production and Construction Company," whose main business is to engage in industrial and commercial monopoly activities. In addition, the "Gansu Transportation Company," which controls all transportation companies in the Northwest, was also officially established before the New Year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 8th: The Chiang bandit's shipping monopoly organization "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company" has again joined forces with China Navigation Company, Central China Shipping Company, and Yixiang Steamship Company to organize an "Overseas Shipping Joint Business Office" in order to expand its monopoly scope. The person in charge of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also serves as the director of the office, monopolizing all overseas import and export trade shipping. Its business scope also stipulates that it can sign overseas transportation contracts, agency contracts, and charter contracts with Chinese and foreign material organizations, shipping companies, and other transportation institutions.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: Various sources: The Chiang bandit traitorous government is taking various steps to strengthen and monopolize trade with Japan. The Chiang bandit Central Bank has prepared to establish a branch in Tokyo and stipulates that its central business is to serve the dumping of Japanese goods into China under the direct command of the US military headquarters and to "supervise" the "commercial institutions" that the Chiang bandit allowed to be established in Japan. Air and sea transportation between Chiang and Japan has also been strengthened simultaneously. The Chiang bandit China National Aviation Corporation and the "US Military Headquarters" stationed in Japan have reached an oral agreement on the Chiang-Japan air traffic problem after half a year of negotiations. The person in charge of the company will soon go to Japan to formally complete the route agreement. The Chiang bandit water transport monopoly organization China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent people to Japan as early as December last year to prepare for the establishment of an office.

    【新华社陕北十二日电】据外国通讯社上海消息：四大家族各银行乘旧历年关，民间工商业家资金周转不灵之际，一面停止一切贷款，一面贱价收买工厂商店存货，以便囤积居奇，高价抛售，蒋匪四联总处买进达一百五十批，值蒋币一千五百亿元。由于市民购买力萎缩，店主需款还债，若干商品除夕价格普遍降低百分之十，但生意比阳历除夕还坏。同时，广大市民最需要的大米，则急剧上涨。
    【新华社陕北八日电】据蒋区报纸消息：四大家族垄断资本积极向西北扩张，蒋匪西北民生实业公司已正式改设于南京，并于上海、兰州、迪化三地设分公司，自拥汽车一百辆。该公司业务计划包括农工矿商四大部门，全盘垄断西北经济的。四大家族垄断系统下之省级垄断机构亦积极活动，兰州蒋匪当局即将成立“生产建设公司”，该公司主要业务为从事工商业之垄断活动。又控制西北全部交通运输公司的“甘肃运输动公司”，亦于年前正式成立。

    【新华社陕北九日电】各方消息：蒋匪卖国政府正采取各种步骤加强与垄断对日贸易。蒋匪中央银行已准备在东京设立分行，并规定其中心业务乃在美军总部直接指挥下，为日货对华倾销服务，并对蒋匪所允在日设立的“商业机关”施以“监督”。蒋日间海空运输也已同时加强，蒋匪中国航空公司与驻日“美军统帅部”谈判半年之蒋日通航问题，已于上月底达成口头协定，该公司负责人即将赴日正式完成航线协定。蒋匪水运垄断组织招商局，则早于去年十二月即派人赴日筹设办事处。
