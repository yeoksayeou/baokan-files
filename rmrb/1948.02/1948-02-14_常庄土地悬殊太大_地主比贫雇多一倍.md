[Taiyue News] Changzhuang is a natural village under the jurisdiction of Jiangjiazhuang village in the Second District of Tunliu. It has 23 households of poor peasants and hired laborers, totaling 69 people, accounting for 36% of the village's population; their land amounts to 217.5 mu, only accounting for 26% of the village's total land. The average landholding per person is 3.15 mu. There are 29 households of rich peasants and landlords, totaling 120 people (the method of class division may still have inaccuracies – Editor), owning 609.5 mu of land, with an average landholding of 6.007 mu per person. The average yield of coarse grains in this village is only around five dou per mu. In particular, poor peasants and hired laborers have little land and a weak foundation. They bear the same burdens and corvée labor as others, which is truly unbearable. For example, Chang Changzhu, a hired laborer, has a family of three and cultivates 11.5 mu of land. Last autumn, they harvested six shi and three dou of millet and five shi and two dou of corn, equivalent to five shi and three dou of rice. After paying one shi and six dou for burdens and three dou of wheat, they only had three shi and two dou of rice left, which is not enough for three people to eat for four months. Generally, the existing grain of poor peasants and hired laborers can only last until the end of the year, and at best until before the spring plowing, so most of them eat bran. Not only are the burdens heavy, but some of them have not received any fruits of the struggle. For example, Chang Haide only recently escaped from his life as a hired laborer but still has no house or land. During the struggle, Zhao Desheng and Huo Jinxi of this village shielded the landlords and oppressed the poor peasants and hired laborers. At a meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers, Huo Zihai said, "I requested to join the peasant association, but people said that if I had a share of the burdens, I could not join. However, the landlord Chang Junming was struggled against, but his son still joined the peasant association and received the fruits of the struggle."

    常庄土地悬殊太大
    地主比贫雇多一倍
    【太岳消息】常庄是屯留二区姜家庄编村的一个自然庄，有雇贫农二十三户，六十九口人，占全村人口的百分之三十六；土地二百一十七亩半，仅占全村土地的百分之二十六。每人平均土地三亩一分五。富农、地主二十九户，一百二十口人（划阶级的方法可能还有不对头的地方——编者），土地六百零九亩五分，每人平均土地六亩零七厘。这村土地平均产杂粮每亩不过五斗上下，特别是雇贫农土地少，底子空，和别人一样的支差出负担，实在受不了。如雇贫常长住，家有三口人，种地十一亩半，去秋打下谷子六石三，玉茭五石二，共合米五石三，出了负担一石六斗，麦子三斗，净剩米三石二，不够三口人四个月的粮食。一般雇贫现有的粮食只能吃到年底，顶好的能吃到春耕前，所以大部吃糠。不光负担重，他们有的根本没有分到果实，如常海德今年才脱离了雇工生活，还是房无一间，地无一亩。在斗争时本村赵德胜、霍金喜等包庇地主，欺压雇贫。雇贫会上霍滋海说：“我要求参加农会，人家说有份儿负担分数，就不能参加。可是地主常俊明被斗了，他儿子还参加农会分果实。”
