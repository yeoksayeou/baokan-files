Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Shanghai Dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government has decided to sell China's inland waterway navigation rights to American imperialism as one of the conditions for U.S. aid to Chiang. The ports to be opened include Nanjing and Hankou. The Shanghai shipping industry has lodged a serious protest, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's move as "selling out national independence." Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Dong Xian Guang, made a so-called "denial" (actually an admission) in Nanjing on the 18th, admitting that the (Chiang Kai-shek) government could "freely" open any coastal and inland river port when necessary for foreign ships to load and unload export or import goods. Since the establishment of the Water Transport Brigade in China in the name of the US aid to Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Headquarters by American imperialism the year before last, China's inland waterway navigation rights have in fact been in the hands of American imperialism. The Water Transport Brigade has nearly 300,000 tons of ships in China, freely navigating Chinese ports under the pretext of "transporting relief supplies." The current purpose of American imperialism is to strengthen and expand this right of aggression against China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: According to a semi-official newspaper in Shanghai on the 9th of this month: "From March 1st, Taiwan will restrict travel to and from the island. Passengers traveling to Taiwan from Shanghai, Fuzhou, or other places will be required to fill out forms and submit photos for approval by the military police." This is one of the open steps taken by Chiang Kai-shek after signing a secret agreement to sell Taiwan to American imperialism, determined to make Taiwan special. The newspaper revealed that the implementation of this passport system, which is only used between countries, is under the pretext of "Sino-American (Chiang Kai-shek) cooperation in the development of Taiwan" and the "construction of a national defense blockade line" in Taiwan. The result will be the formation of a "Sino-American (Chiang) cooperation to blockade Taiwan," and Chinese compatriots will no longer be able to freely enter and leave their own country.

　　蒋匪出卖内河航权  沪航业界提出抗议
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】上海消息：蒋匪卖国政府已决定将中国内河航行权出卖给美帝国主义，作为美帝援蒋条件之一。决定开放之港口包括南京、汉口在内。上海航业界已提出严重抗议，痛斥蒋匪此举为“出卖国家独立”。蒋匪发言人董显光于十八日在南京为此所作之所谓“否认”（实际是承认）声明中供认：（蒋匪）政府对于外籍船只装运输出或起卸输入货物，必要时可“自由”开放沿海及内河任何一港口。自前年美帝借蒋匪行总名义在华成立水运大队以来，中国内河航行权事实上已掌握在美帝手中。该水运大队在华共拥有船只近三十万吨，在“运送救济物资”借口下自由航行中国各口岸。美帝现在的目的是要把此项侵华权利加强和扩大起来。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据上海某半官方报纸本月九日消息：“自三月一日起，台湾将限制进出该岛的旅行。上海、福州或其他各地前往台湾的旅客，需要填写表格，并呈交照片，以待宪警核准”。这是蒋匪在签订出卖台湾给美帝国主义的密约之后，决意使台湾特殊化的公开步骤之一。该报泄露：这种仅采用于国与国之间的护照制度的实行，是蒋匪当局以“中（蒋匪）美合作开发台湾”，及在台湾“建设国防封锁线”为借口的，其结果将形成“中（蒋）美合作封锁台湾”，而中国同胞从此将不能在本国境内自由进出。
