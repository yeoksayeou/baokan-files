Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 4th. Our branch reporter recently commented on the morale of the Kuomintang army in Northeast China, stating: In recent years, under the continuous heavy blows of the People's Liberation Army and the influence of the policy of not killing or insulting prisoners, the Kuomintang army in Northeast China has not only been in a completely passive position militarily, but also has undergone new and significant changes in its internal political sentiment. This is primarily reflected in the changes in the composition of the Kuomintang army. The number of veteran soldiers has decreased sharply, while the number of new recruits, who are untrained and harbor dissatisfaction, has increased significantly. New recruits generally account for more than 80% of the troops, and in some cases even up to 90%. These new recruits are entirely conscripted and lack combat skills training, and their sentiments of homesickness and war-weariness are very strong. Soldiers of the enemy's 71st Army, who laid down their weapons in Xinmin, confessed: "Most of our troops are new recruits from the Northeast, and they are very much looking forward to the People's Liberation Army's attack so that they can take the opportunity to escape." Furthermore, according to enemy documents seized by us, in general, Kuomintang companies have three to five deserters almost every day, and the 59th Provisional Division has up to 700 to 800 deserters each month. The 21st Provisional Division had more than 2,000 officially reported deserters in the two years of civil war, and the actual number was probably even greater. Some units even experienced entire companies or platoons deserting. For example, a company of the 552nd Regiment of the 184th Division deserted en masse while washing clothes by the river. Enemy officers also desert frequently. According to incomplete statistics from the Kuomintang Northeast Headquarters itself, from June to November of last year alone, more than 400 middle and lower-ranking officers deserted from the directly subordinate units of the Headquarters. Recently, in Jilin, Changchun, Siping and other places, under the siege of our army, the enemy's mood of defeat has risen, and a large number of deserters have automatically surrendered to our army. A certain unit in the vicinity of Faku has accepted more than 60 surrendered officers and soldiers in fifteen days. Recently, more than 200 Kuomintang soldiers in Jilin surrendered to our army, and in December of last year, two squads surrendered to us with their weapons. In January of this year, four platoons came over to our side collectively. Although the number of Kuomintang soldiers who deserted during combat cannot be statistically determined, according to prisoners' confessions, every time a gun is fired, many people change into civilian clothes and flee. Those who do not have time to escape quickly lay down their weapons in the thousands. For example, in the Xinlitun campaign last month, more than 8,000 of the 9,000 Kuomintang officers and soldiers were captured with just a brief engagement. The ratio of killed and wounded to captured was one to ten. The demand for retirement is also very common within the Kuomintang army. The Kuomintang bandits' frustration is also reflected among senior officers. Liu Zigao, commander of the enemy's 62nd Provisional Division, which was besieged by the People's Liberation Army in Faku, said despondently in a lecture to his subordinates: "The fortifications we build are tombs, and Faku is the tomb of our division." Many officers fear war and have asked to be transferred to rear transport and logistical departments in order to save their lives. Those whose requests are not approved become passive and derelict in their duties, leading a decadent lifestyle, with rampant prostitution and gambling being even more prevalent than before. Our army has examined the bodies of captured officers and found that more than 50% of them suffer from various venereal diseases. The reporter finally pointed out: The officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang bandits in Northeast China have reached a point where it is no longer a matter of consideration but a final choice of fate: either lay down their weapons as soon as possible, or sell their lives for the Kuomintang bandits to the end and bring destruction upon themselves. The People's Liberation Army will spare no opportunity to win over and advise all officers and soldiers who are forced to fight for the Kuomintang bandits, especially middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers. As long as they can lay down their weapons and stand on the side of the people, our army will welcome and treat them favorably without exception.

    东北蒋匪士气更加低落
    全连全排逃亡哗变
    打仗一听枪响成千成万投降
    【新华社东北四日电】分社记者顷评述东北蒋军士气称：年来东北蒋军在解放军连续沉重的打击与不杀不辱的俘虏政策影响下，不但军事上早已陷于完全被动，而内部政治情绪也发生了新的显著变化。首先表现在蒋军内部成份的变化。部队中老兵急剧减少，未受训练，心怀不满的新兵大量增加。一般部队的新兵占百分之八十以上，有的甚至达百分之九十。这些完全是抓来的新兵，毫无战斗技术的训练，思乡厌战的情绪十分浓厚，在新民放下武器的敌七十一军士兵供称：“我们部队多是东北新兵，非常盼望解放军进攻，以便乘机逃跑”。又据我缴获敌方文件证明：蒋军一般连队几乎每天都有三、五个逃亡，暂五十九师每月逃亡达七百至八百名。暂廿一师在两年内战中，其公开呈报的逃亡数字为两千余名，实际数目当比这更大。有的部队甚至是全连全排逃亡。如一八四师五五二团一个连，一次到河边洗衣，即全连哗变。敌军官逃亡的亦多。据蒋匪东北行辕自己的不完全统计，自去年六月至十一月间，仅行辕直属部队之中下级军官就逃了四百多人。最近吉林、长春、四平等地在我军围困下，敌军失败情绪高涨，大批逃亡者自动向我军投诚。某部在法库附近，十五天中收容了投诚官兵六十多名。吉林蒋军最近向我军投诚的有两百多名，去年十二月中有两班携械向我投诚。今年一月份中有四个排集体来归。蒋军在战斗中潜逃的数字虽无法统计，但据俘虏供称：每是枪声一响，就有很多人换上便衣逃走。不及逃跑的，即成千成万的迅速放下武器，如上月新立屯战役蒋匪九千余官兵稍一接触，即有八千余名就俘，毙伤与被俘是一与十之比，蒋军内部要求退伍的也很普遍。蒋匪的沮丧情绪也表现在高级军官之中，被解放军围困的法库敌暂六十二师师长刘梓皋在一次对部下的训话中灰心丧气的说：“工事修好了就是坟墓，法库就是我们这个师的坟墓”。许多军官恐惧战争，纷纷要求调到后方运输勤杂等部门去，以求保身保命。要求不准的则消极怠职，生活颓废，狂嫖滥赌较前更甚。我军曾检查被俘军官的身体，发现患各种性病的达百分之五十以上。记者最后指出：东北蒋匪官兵已到了不是考虑而是最后选择命运的时候了，或者趁早放下武器，或者替蒋贼卖命到底，自取灭亡。解放军不惜任何机会争取与忠告一切被迫为蒋贼作战的官兵，特别是中下级官兵，只要他能够放下武器，站到人民方面来，我军一律表示欢迎和优待。
