Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 16th: New York dispatch: The plummeting of American commodity prices and stocks is intensifying, increasing the fear of American monopoly capitalists. TASS reported that on February 13th, commodity prices across the United States continued to fall, with the wholesale price index for 35 commodities dropping to 186.32, compared to 207.61 a month earlier. A United Press report on February 14th also stated: "Some commodity prices have plunged by as much as 30.9%. The hard-hit May wheat futures are down 22.7% from their peak, corn is down 24.2%, oats are down 24.1%, soybeans are down 27.4%, soybean oil is down 24.8%, and cottonseed oil is down 26.7%." Even "sugar has fallen by 16.3%, coffee by 20%, and cocoa by 8.2%." "Rubber, which is not produced much in the United States, has also fallen by 11.2%," and "butter, which is essential for households, has fallen by 4.9%, and eggs by 2.6%." Industrial stocks are generally 8.5% lower than their highest prices this year, and London stocks on the American market are down 11%. "Even the stocks of Ford Motor Company, which has the highest profits, have fallen." This situation is unsettling Wall Street bosses. According to a disclosure by Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency: "Many Americans feel doubtful and uneasy, unsure of how far commodity prices will fall, and whether the long-feared economic panic has finally arrived."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 15th: Comprehensive report: After eight consecutive days of plummeting commodity prices and stocks in the United States, all major markets across the country were forced to close for one day on February 12th, ostensibly to commemorate Lincoln's death. As of February 12th, the commodity market had experienced the most violent price drop in American history. According to United Press, "The decline in retail grain prices has greatly exceeded the crash of 1929." The price of May wheat futures in Chicago peaked at $3.065 per bushel on January 16th, while the market price on February 11th was $2.237. The price of May corn futures peaked at $2.7075 per bushel on January 16th, but fell by $0.6525 to February 11th. A large soap manufacturer in Chicago reduced wholesale prices by 5% on February 12th. Similar price crashes to those in Chicago also occurred in Kansas City and Minneapolis.

The decline in New York stocks "has fallen to a new low since June of last year" (Associated Press). It is estimated that in the past week (February 4th to 11th), the value of securities has lost $3 billion due to the price decline. Moreover, even the stocks of the largest American monopoly enterprises, such as US Steel, American Telephone, General Electric, and Texaco, have begun to decline. According to a TASS report on February 13th: "Accompanying this decline in securities prices will be a contraction of enterprises." American statistical agencies report that the number of bankruptcies of American enterprises has increased sharply this year. In the first five weeks of this year, a total of 503 bankruptcies occurred, compared to only 280 in the same period last year, and only 125 in the same period the year before last. "Certain industries, including the manufacture of engines under one horsepower, hosiery, certain sectors of the textile industry, and the food industry, will all suffer severe reductions in production" (US Commerce Daily). These situations make American monopoly capitalists feel bleak about the future. According to United Press, "Market confidence has disappeared," "The widespread growth of fear is a prelude to a general and rapid economic downturn." The Associated Press revealed that many bourgeois economists in the United States are panicking and unable to predict the future. The Democratic and Republican parties are "mutually blaming each other for the market declines" (Central News Agency, New York English dispatch), fully demonstrating the embarrassment of the American ruling class.

    经济危机的信号
    美股票物价连续狂跌
    已大大超过上次经济危机时跌落程度
    【新华社陕北十六日电】纽约讯：美国物价与股票证券的狂跌，愈加猛烈，并使美国独占资本家的恐惧日益增长。塔斯社报导全美十三日的物价继续下跌，三十五种商品批发价格指数跌至一八六·三二，而一个月前为二○七·六一。合众社十四日的报导亦称：“商品价格暴跌已有达百分之三十点九者，饱受打击的五月小麦期货价格比其最高时降低百分之二十二点七，玉蜀黍降低百分之二十四点二，燕麦低百分之二十四点一，大豆低百分之二七点四，大豆油跌百分之二四点八，棉子油跌百分之二六点七”。甚至“糖亦跌价百分之一六点三，咖啡跌百分之二十，可可跌百分之八点二”，美国生产不多的“橡皮也下跌百分之十一点二”，家庭非用不可的“牛油下跌百分之四点九，鸡蛋下跌百分之二点六。”工业股票一般都比本年最高价格低落百分之八点五，美国市场上的伦敦股票低落百分之十一”，获利最丰的福特汽车公司股票亦告下跌，此种情形使华尔街老板们心神不安，据蒋匪中央社透露：“许多美国人士皆感疑虑不安，未悉物价之下落究将达到何种程度，是否各方畏惧已久之经济恐慌已经最后来到”。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：美国物价与股票证券连续狂跌八天之后，迫使全国各大市场借口纪念林肯逝世而于十二日歇业一日。截至十二日止，商品市场已出现了美国历史上最猛烈的跌价。据合众社称：“粮食零售价格的下降，大大的超过了一九二九年的暴跌”。芝加哥五月份小麦期货，每蒲式尔价格最高时为一月十六日的三元零六分五，而十一日的市场价格则为二元三角七分，五月份玉蜀黍期货，每蒲式尔价格最高时为一月十六日的二元七角零七厘五，至十一日跌落了六角五分二厘五，芝加哥大肥皂制造家于十二日将批发价减少百分之五。堪萨斯及明尼亚波里斯两地，亦发生类似芝加哥的物价暴跌。
    纽约股票证券的跌价，“已降到去年六月以来的新的低度”（美联社）。据估计一周来（四日至十一日）证券价值已因跌价而损失了三十亿美元。不仅如此，甚至美国最大的垄断企业，如美国钢铁公司，美国电话公司，通用电气公司及德克萨斯公司等的股票，亦已开始跌价。据塔斯社十三日电报导：“随着这种证券价格的降落而俱来的，将是企业的萎缩”。美国统计机关称：今年美国企业的破产数目大增，自本年年初起五星期内，共发生破产案五百零三起，去年同一时期内则仅二百八十起，前年同期内只有一百二十五起。“某些工业，包括制造一匹马力以下的引擎制造业、鞋袜业、纺织业的某些部门和粮食工业的生产都将遭受到严重的消减”（美国商务日报）。这些情形，使美国独占资本家感到前景之暗淡，据合众社透露：“市场的信心已经消失”，“普遍增长的恐惧心，即是经济普遍急转直下的前奏。”美联社则透露美国许多资产阶级经济学家惶惶然无法预示将来的前途。民主、共和两党则“已以市场上的跌价互相谴责”（中央社纽约英文电），充分表现美统治阶级的狼狈。
