Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th: The Binhai Military Sub-district and the Administrative Office jointly issued instructions, strictly stipulating measures to reduce the burden of labor service on villagers: (1) Reduce the official duties of village cadres and oppose the "official yamen" style. All organs and troops should appropriately add daily necessities such as bowls, chopsticks, vegetable basins, and water tanks. Items that must be borrowed should be borrowed and exchanged uniformly by the management department. Personnel going out to villages for meals, exchanging fodder, and lighting lamps must pay grain coupons, food money, grass tickets, material tickets, and lamp oil fees. It is forbidden to exchange coarse for fine, use grain to offset vegetables, or pay less or not at all. (2) Strictly control the procedures for dispatching labor. Dispatching labor requires a dispatch certificate. Organs and troops should organize their own grinding and cooking, and transport grain and grass within a 30-mile radius (except for troops in combat). Advocate self-sewing and mending. The delivery of letters and all odd jobs are prohibited from using civilian labor. (3) Divide areas for borrowing items, issue borrowing certificates for borrowed items, and compensate for any damage. It is strictly forbidden to privately set official prices, demand more and give less, and prohibit engaging in labor production such as picking up grass and manure, and fishing, which compete with the people for profit. Other acts that harm the interests of the masses are also prohibited.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th: The Binhai District Committee, Military Sub-district, Administrative Office, and other organs recently conducted a detailed investigation of discipline in villages. Because the personnel of various organs generally harbor the remnant ideas of landlords, rich peasants, and warlords, they arbitrarily increase the burden on the masses in the stationed areas. When the military sub-district first arrived in a certain village, in addition to the help of the children's corps, literacy classes, and the village head, more than a dozen village cadres were specially assigned to handle errands for the organs every day. In addition to bearing the burdens of sending cadres and their families, transporting grain, grass, and delivering letters, the masses even used civilian labor for odd jobs such as burning firewood, chopping wood, building stoves, making tofu, sprouting soybeans, and moving utensils. The military sub-district used 180 civilian laborers within five days of moving to a certain village. The burden on women for sewing clothes and making shoes was also extremely heavy, and they often provided needles and thread. In addition, the procedures for borrowing utensils were chaotic, with some items borrowed but not returned, or returned in damaged condition. Based on the above situation, the district military and political organs immediately convened a military conference to thoroughly convey the "Measures to Reduce the Labor Service Burden on Villagers," and established a joint military-civilian office in the stationed village to uniformly raise grain, grass, fodder, and necessary utensils for the troops, and assist the masses in supervising the troops to abide by discipline. The situation was promptly reported to the troops. Currently, various departments are enthusiastically discussing ways to reduce the burden on the masses through production and frugality, self-transportation of grain and grass, and self-grinding and self-cooking.

    滨海订定减轻民负办法
    【新华社山东十三日电】滨北军分区、专署发布联合训令，严格订定减轻驻村劳役负担办法：（一）减轻村干应差事务，反对“衙门”作风，各机关部队酌情添置碗筷、菜盆、水缸等日常用品，必须借用之物品，概由管理部门统一批借兑换。外出人员到村派饭、兑换草料、点灯等必须照付粮票、菜金、草票、料票及灯油费，禁止以粗换细，以粮顶菜及少付不付现象。（二）严格支差手续，支差要有支差证，机关部队组织自磨自食，三十里路内自运粮草（部队在战斗情况下例外），提倡自缝自补，传递信条，及一切零活禁止使用民力。（三）划分借物地区，借物给借证，损坏一定赔偿，严禁私订官价，少给多要，禁止从事拾草拾粪，摸鱼等与民争利的劳动生产，并禁止其他一切损害群众利益行为。
    【新华社山东十三日电】滨北地委、军分区、专署等机关，于日前详细调查驻村纪律。由于各机关人员普遍存在地主富农和军阀残余思想，随意增加驻地群众负担。军分区初到某庄时，除儿童团、识字班、闾长等帮助外，每天有十几个村干专为机关应差。群众除负担送干部、家属、运粮、运草、递信等差役外甚至连烧火、劈柴、打锅台、做豆腐、生豆芽、搬用具等零活也使用民力，军分区移驻某村五天即使用民工一百八十个，妇女缝衣、做鞋等负担亦极繁重，且常贴针线。此外所借用具手续混乱，有借无还、或借好还坏。根据上述情形，分区军政机关即召开军人大会，详细传达“减轻驻村群众劳役办法”，并成立驻村军民联合办事处，统一筹借部队所用之粮草、马料及必须用具，并协助群众监督部队遵守纪律。及时向部队反映情况，现各部门正热烈讨论生产节约，自运粮草、自磨自食等减轻群众负担办法。
