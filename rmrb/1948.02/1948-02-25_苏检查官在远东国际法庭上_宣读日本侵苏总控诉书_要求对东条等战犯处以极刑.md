    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd Dispatch] Tokyo News: The Far East International Military Tribunal's trial of Japanese war criminals has lasted for nearly two years and is now nearing the sentencing stage. On the 18th of this month, Major General Vasilev, the Soviet prosecutor of the tribunal's prosecutor's office, read a 170-page general indictment on the Japanese aggression against the Soviet Union, demanding the death penalty for Tojo and 24 other major war criminals. The Soviet prosecutor pointed out: This is not only to give due punishment to the Japanese aggression and atrocities, but also to warn those with crazy ideas of dominating the world, so that they dare not dream of following suit. In stating the crimes of the Japanese invaders against the Soviet Union, Major General Vasilev pointed out that Japan should bear the same responsibility as Nazi Germany for World War II. This great war was the biggest crime in the international community, which caused the blood of millions of innocent people to flow into the sea. (Editor's note: The 25 war criminals proposed by the Soviet Union include four former prime ministers: Hirota Koki, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Tojo Hideki, and Koiso Kuniaki. Those who served as cabinet ministers or key military officials, or were ringleaders of special agents, include: Araki Sadao, Itagaki Seishiro, Yanagawa Shunroku, Shigemitsu Aoi, Togo Shigenori, Kido Koichi, Umezu Yoshijiro, Doihara, Matsui Iwane, Hashimoto Kingoro, etc., all of whom were key criminals in the invasion of China).
