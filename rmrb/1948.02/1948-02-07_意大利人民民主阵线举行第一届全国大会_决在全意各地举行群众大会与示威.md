Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Rome dispatch: The first national congress of the Italian People's Democratic Front, striving for peace, freedom, labor, and independence, was solemnly held here on the 1st. Participants included representatives from various political parties, mass organizations, and local organizations of the Front. The congress adopted the Front's program drafted by the preparatory committee. During the discussion, speakers unanimously called on the Italian people to strengthen unity and fight for democracy and against the reactionaries and remnants of Fascism. Roussou, leader of the Sardinian branch of the Action Party, declared: "All true democrats are honored to cooperate with the Communist Party, which is a constructive force in every modern democratic country." General Yazzi, a former Republican Party member, stated that after breaking away from the Republican Party, which colluded with Gasperi, he and his supporters in the Republican Party established the People's Republican Party and joined the People's Democratic Front. Maddalena, chairwoman of the Italian Women's League, called on all Italian democratic groups to participate in the peace conference to be held in Rome on March 14th. Representatives of other democratic groups expressed their enthusiastic support for the People's Democratic Front at the meeting. Professor Secolo, a member of the congress preparatory committee, emphasized in his closing remarks that the people's democratic movement is expanding throughout Italy with unprecedented force. He pointed out that the working people, led by democratic parties, have frustrated the Gasperi reactionary regime's efforts to restore Fascist rule in Italy. Secolo concluded by stating that the establishment of the People's Democratic Front is to give the people the freedom to decide their own destiny and manage their country. The congress decided to hold mass rallies and demonstrations of the People's Democratic Front throughout Italy on February 8th, and elected the presidium and executive committee. The presidium includes Secolo (non-partisan), Togliatti (Italian Communist Party), Nenni (Socialist Party), Vittorio (General Confederation of Labor), Moro (Labor Democratic Party), and several representatives from other political parties and organizations. The executive committee includes six members from the Italian Communist Party, six from the Socialist Party, and many representatives from other democratic political parties and organizations. The National Council of the People's Democratic Front, consisting of 70 to 80 people, will also be established soon. The congress finally adopted the Front's letter to the Italian people.
