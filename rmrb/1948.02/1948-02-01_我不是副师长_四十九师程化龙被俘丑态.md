    "I am not a Deputy Division Commander"
    The Ugly Behavior of Cheng Hualong of the 49th Division After Being Captured
    [Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 28th] Correspondent Chang Gong reports: The following is the story of how the People's Liberation Army discovered Chiang Kai-shek's 43rd Division Major General Deputy Division Commander Cheng Hualong (formerly mistakenly written as Chen Hualong) among the prisoners of war after the Shenyang-Beiping Campaign.
    Cheng Hualong is from Tianmen, Hubei, 36 years old, and a graduate of the 7th class of Chiang's Central Military Academy. When Section Chief Zhang of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army talked to him, he falsely claimed to be from Hunan, 45 years old, named Zhang Yuxin, and a Second Lieutenant clerk in the search company. Section Chief Zhang asked him, "Aren't you the Deputy Division Commander?" "I can swear, I really am not the Deputy Division Commander." Then he raised his left hand and said, "I, Cheng Hualong..." Unexpectedly, in his haste, he blurted out his real name, causing a burst of laughter in the room. At this point, Cheng Hualong looked extremely embarrassed and had to say, with a red face, "If the Section Chief says I am, what can I do?"
    Section Chief Zhang took him to live in the room for officers at the rank of colonel. He was afraid that other officers would call out his real name, so as soon as he entered the door, he introduced himself, "I am a Second Lieutenant clerk, and they insist that I am the Deputy Division Commander." Liu Angfen, the commander of the 128th Regiment, who was sleeping on the kang, suddenly jumped off the kang and pretended to be very familiar, saying, "Isn't this Clerk Dian?" "No, my surname is not Dian, my surname is Zhang." He was afraid that Liu Angfen would mispronounce his name, so he hurriedly added, "My name is Zhang Yuxin." The room burst into laughter again. Chen Mengxie, the Deputy Commander of the 123rd Regiment, wanted to ease the atmosphere and said, "Stop pretending, get on the kang and sleep." "No, I am not the Deputy Division Commander." "Even if you are not the Deputy Division Commander, you still have to sleep." After Chen Mengxie finished speaking, there was another burst of laughter in the room. Cheng Hualong refused to get on the kang and fell asleep on the ground. The next day, after Chiang's New 5th Army Major General Commander Chen Linda and 195th Division Major General Deputy Division Commander Yan Ziyun were discovered, Section Chief Zhang called Cheng Hualong again. As soon as he entered the door, he said, "You must say I am the Deputy Division Commander. Who will testify?" "You want proof?" Section Chief Zhang said, "You are too ungrateful. Is there really no one to testify?" Cheng Hualong still wanted to evade and deny it, but Chen Linda, who was sitting next to him, glanced at him, and he stopped talking and sat there blankly, then burst into tears: "I admit it, what will happen to my family?" Section Chief Zhang tried his best to comfort him and promised to forward a letter to his family, and he stopped crying.

    “我不是副师长”
    四十九师程化龙被俘丑态
    【新华社东北二十八日电】分社记者常工报导：沈北战役后，解放军在俘虏群中查出蒋匪四十三师少将副师长程化龙（前误陈化龙）的经过情形。
    程化龙湖北天门人，现年三十六岁，蒋记中央军校七期毕业。当解放军某部张科长和他谈话时，他假称是湖南人，今年四十五岁，名叫张玉新，是搜索连的中尉司书。张科长问他：“你不是副师长吗？”“我可以发誓，我真不是副师长。”接着他就把左手一举说：“我程化龙………”没想到他一着急，便把真姓名讲出来了，引起屋内哄堂大笑，这时，程化龙窘态毕露，只好红着脸说：“科长说我是，我有啥办法”？
    张科长把他带到校级军官房内去住，他生怕其他军官喊出他的真实姓名，一进门就自我介绍说：“我是中尉司书，他们硬说我是副师长”。睡在炕上的一二八团团附刘昂芬忽然从炕上跳下来，故意装作很熟的样子说：“这不是典司书吗”？“不，我不姓典，我姓张”。他怕刘昂芬把他的名字说错了，又急忙补充说：“我叫张玉新”。房内又哄笑起来。一二三团副团长陈孟谐想缓和一下空气说：“别装模作样了，上炕睡觉吧”。“不，我不是副师长”。“不是副师长也得睡觉呵”。陈孟谐说完，房内又是一阵哄笑。程化龙没肯上炕，就在地上倒下睡了。第二天蒋匪新五军少将军长陈林达和一九五师少将副师长阎资筠被查获后，张科长又把程化龙传来，他一进门又说：“你们一定说我是副师长谁作证明”？“你要证明吗？”张科长说：“你太不识抬举了，难道真没有人证明吗？”程化龙还想支唔抵赖，坐在旁边的陈林达向他瞅了一眼，他才不做声呆呆的坐下了，接着哇哇的哭了起来：“我承认了，我的家怎办呀？”张科长极力安慰他，并答应为他转家信他才收住了哭。
