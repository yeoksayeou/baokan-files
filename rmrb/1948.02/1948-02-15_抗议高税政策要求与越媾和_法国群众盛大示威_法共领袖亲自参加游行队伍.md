Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: Paris dispatch: Under the call of the French Communist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, and other democratic organizations, Paris and other major French cities held grand mass demonstrations and marches on the 8th to commemorate the centenary of the February 1848 revolution that overthrew the autocratic dynasty, and the February 1934 victory of the French working class against the fascist rebels, and to call on the French people to "Defend Peace! Defend Democracy!" In Paris, French Communist Party leaders Thorez, Duclos, and Casan, among others, personally participated in the march. Representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, the Paris Regional Federation of Trade Unions, and other democratic organizations also participated. Demonstrators held aloft placards with slogans such as "Defend Peace!" and "Defend Democracy!" and marched from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la République. The demonstrating masses demanded the repeal of the Mayer tax law, demanded peace with Vietnam, opposed the reopening of the Franco-Spanish border, and protested against high prices. Similar demonstrations were also held simultaneously in Toulouse, Marseille, La Rochelle, Lille, and many other cities. Note: A century ago, the working people of Paris took the lead in overthrowing the Philippe dynasty; fourteen years ago, when Colonel de la Rocque's fascist bandits openly showed their faces, the workers of Paris immediately stopped them, and the French workers then (February 12, 1934) victoriously carried out a general strike of 4.5 million people, repelled the fascist offensive, and laid the foundation for the Popular Front.

    抗议高税政策要求与越媾和
    法国群众盛大示威
    法共领袖亲自参加游行队伍
    【新华社陕北十二日电】巴黎讯：在法共、总工会及其他民主社团号召之下，巴黎及法国其他大城市均于八日举行了盛大的群众示威游行，以纪念一八四八年二月推翻专制王朝的一百年，及一九三四年二月，法国工人阶级对法西斯叛乱者的胜利斗争，并号召法国人民“保卫和平！保卫民主！”在巴黎，法共领袖多列士、杜克洛及加善等，亲自参加了游行的行列。总工会及巴黎区职工联合会及其他民主社团亦派有代表参加。游行者高举“保卫和平！”“保卫民主！”的口号牌，从巴斯底广场向共和广场进发。示威群众要求取消迈耶税收法，要求与越南媾和，反对重开法西（西班牙）边界，并抗议物价高涨。同样的示威在土鲁斯、马赛、罗舍尔、里尔及其他许多城市亦同时举行。按：一百年前，巴黎劳动人民带头推翻了腓力普王朝；十四年前，当拉·洛克上校的法西斯匪徒公开露脸时，巴黎工人立即拦住了他们，法国工人并于那时（一九三四年二月十二日）胜利进行了四百五十万人的总罢工，击退了法西斯的进攻，奠定了人民阵线。
