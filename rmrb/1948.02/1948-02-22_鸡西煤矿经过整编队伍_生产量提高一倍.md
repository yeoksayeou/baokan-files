　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: Workers in the Jixi Coal Mine area of ​​Mudanjiang Province are caught up in the wave of workforce reorganization and production. Since the mine held a conference for cadres involved in the reorganization at the end of last month, all employees have enthusiastically launched a campaign to render meritorious service, increasing production to support the front lines. The conference put forward the production task for 1948: to produce 2.1 million to 2.3 million tons of coal. In order to solve the problem of winter fuel for the city, it was decided to increase the daily output from 160 train cars to 200 train cars (a total of 6,000 tons). The mine's output has been increasing month by month in the past year, with October's output nearly doubling that of July last year. Thanks to the enthusiasm of the workers, the Mashan pit achieved a brilliant record of 280 tons per day. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the daily output of this pit never exceeded 100 tons. For example, Huang Zhengqing, a new worker at the Hengshan mine, used to produce one cart of coal per day, but after being instructed by veteran workers, he can now produce three or four carts a day. During the puppet Manchukuo period, workers often used "running empty carts" to fool the Japanese devils, but now no worker is willing to push an empty cart. The average output of a worker in the mine has reached 4.5 tons per day. The promoted worker cadres work day and night voluntarily. In order to reduce costs, they themselves take on many miscellaneous tasks inside and outside the pit to reduce the number of odd job workers. They also actively save materials and overcome difficulties. Workers throughout the mine voluntarily contributed more than 200 tools. However, some leading cadres in the mine have not thoroughly embraced the mass line in their thinking. They are concerned that the newly promoted worker cadres are not capable enough and dare not boldly let go and rely on the workers in everything. Some also regard the lack of technical skills of the workers as insurmountable difficulties. On the other hand, there is a lack of class education and concrete assistance for the newly promoted worker cadres, which affects the further increase in production. At this cadre reorganization conference, the above-mentioned shortcomings were reviewed, and a rectification movement will be launched to give full play to the working class's high spirit of serving the people and to ensure the successful completion of the production tasks for 1948.

　　鸡西煤矿经过整编队伍
  　生产量提高一倍
    【新华社东北电】牡丹江省鸡西煤矿区工人卷入整编队伍和生产热潮中。该矿上月底召开全矿区整编干部大会后，全体职工热烈展开立功运动，提高生产支前。大会提出了四八年生产任务，出煤二百一十万吨至二百三十万吨。并为解决冬季城市燃料，决定由每日运出一百六十车皮增至二百车皮（合计六千吨）。该矿一年来产量逐月增加，去年十月较七月几提高一倍。该矿麻山坑由于工友们发挥了积极性，创造了每日二百八十吨的光辉成绩。伪满时该坑每日出产从未超过一百吨。又如恒山矿新工友黄正清原每天出一车煤，经老工友指教后，现在一天能出三四车。伪满时工人常以“跑空车”敷衍日本鬼子，现在工友们谁也不愿推空车了。该矿一个工人一天平均产量已达四吨半。提拔的工人干部不分日夜，自动工作，为了降低成本，他们自己担负起坑内外许多杂务，来减少杂工。并积极节省材料克服困难，全矿工友自动献出工具二百余件。但在矿山部分领导干部的思想上还没有彻底走群众路线，他们耽心大批新起工人干部能力不够，不敢大胆放手，一切依靠工人，也有的将工人缺乏技术看成是不可克服的困难。另方面对新提拔的工人干部又缺乏阶级教育和具体帮助，影响生产的更加提高。此次整编干部大会上，检讨了上述缺点，将展开整顿队伍运动，以发挥工人阶级高度的为人民服务精神。保证四八年的生产任务的胜利完成。
