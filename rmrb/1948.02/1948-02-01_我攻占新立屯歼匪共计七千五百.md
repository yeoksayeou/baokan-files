Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, January 30th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just released Operational Communiqué No. 21, announcing the details and results of the Xinlitun Campaign as follows:

Following the victory at Gongzhutun, our field army braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius and fought continuously. The third campaign unfolded at Xinlitun, an important railway junction west of Shenyang. Our army's attack on the enemy's 26th Division of the 49th Army, which was surrounded, began at 7:00 AM on the 25th. After a day of fighting, we swept away all the enemy outposts around Xinlitun. The enemy, entrenched in strong fortifications and bunkers, were intimidated by the might of our army and attempted to break out of the city in three routes at 4:00 AM on the 26th. One part was compressed into the city by our forces, and after four hours of street fighting, they were completely annihilated. The enemy fleeing from the northeast, northwest, and southwest of the city were caught in the trap we had set only ten miles outside the city, and were captured and annihilated one by one in the frozen wilderness by our various armies. A few remaining enemies who slipped through and fled to Sandao Gou south of Xinlitun were also intercepted by our local forces. The battle ended completely at 4:00 PM on the 26th. Throughout this battle, no enemy troops came to reinforce them. The battle was resolved quickly, and at the cost of only minimal casualties on our part, we completely annihilated an entire enemy division and occupied Xinlitun, a strategic point west of Shenyang. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows:
