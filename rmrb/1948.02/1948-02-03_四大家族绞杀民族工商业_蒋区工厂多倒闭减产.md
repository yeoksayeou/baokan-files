Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—According to comprehensive reports from various sources: As the Lunar New Year approaches, industries, mines, and businesses in the Chiang area are facing closures, shutdowns, and production cuts under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime's policy of strangling national industry and commerce. In Nanjing, the heart of the Chiang bandits, more than twenty stores closed down on the 24th due to business difficulties. Earlier this month, another one hundred and eight stores in Changchun closed down. The larger Shoufeng Flour Company in Tianjin, which originally had three factories with a total of sixty-one flour milling machines, used to produce 15,000 bags of flour per day under normal circumstances. Now, only one factory is operating, exclusively grinding corn flour, producing 2,000 bags a day. Other companies, such as Fuxing and Yutai, are operating intermittently. The chemical raw material industry is panicked due to the loss of customers, and the Yongli Chemical Company is anxious about the increasing production cuts. Small and medium-sized industries are facing even more tragic circumstances due to sales prices being lower than costs and stagnant sales. Tianjin originally had fifty-four soap factories, but ten have already closed down, twenty-one have suspended operations, and only twenty-three are barely operating. Almost all thirty-six oil pressing businesses have shut down. Of the fifty-four dyeing factories, which could dye 313,500 bolts of cloth per month when fully operational, now only dye 60,000 bolts per month. Due to the squeezing out of American goods and increased tobacco taxes, the number of cigarette factories in Peiping has decreased from fourteen to three, and these three are also reducing workers and struggling to survive. After the Chiang bandits stopped foreign exchange settlements in December before the new year, the export of Dagu salt has decreased by three-quarters. Originally, about 80,000 dan of salt could be exported each month, but only 20,000 dan were exported last month. Salt farms are also experiencing a decline in production due to insufficient working capital. Industrialists in Peiping and Tianjin all say that the upcoming Lunar New Year will be more difficult than any previous year. They say that last year, those relying on agricultural raw materials for production—such as flour and vegetable oil industries—have mostly closed down, and this year it will be the turn of industries relying on natural raw materials for production—such as cement and alkali production—to close down.

    四大家族绞杀民族工商业
    蒋区工厂多倒闭减产
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合各方消息：旧历年关行将到来，蒋区工、矿、商业在蒋匪绞杀民族工商业的政策下，纷纷倒闭、停工、减产。蒋匪心脏南京，二十四日有商店二十余家因营业困难倒闭。本月初，长春商店续有一百零八家歇业。津市较大的寿丰面粉公司，原有三个厂，共六十一架磨粉机。平时每天可出粉一万五千袋，现只有一个厂开工专磨玉米面，一天出两千袋。其他如福星、裕泰均时开时停。化学原料工业因失去主顾而恐慌，永利化学公司正为日益减产而焦急。中小工业在售价低于成本、销路停滞下遭遇更为悲惨。天津原有肥皂工厂五十四家，现已倒闭十家，停工二十一家，仅有二十三家勉强开工。榨油业三十六家，几乎全部停业。染厂五十四家，如全部开工每月可染布三十一万三千五百匹，现每月仅染六万匹。由于美货排挤及烟税增加，北平纸烟厂已由十四家减至三家，此三家亦正在缩减工人，苟延残喘。年前十二月蒋匪停止押汇后，大沽盐出口已减少四分之三，原来每月可输出盐八万担左右，上月只出口了两万担。盐场因资金周转不灵，生产亦随之下降。平津的工业家都说行将到来的旧历年关，比过去任何一个年关都难过。他们说，去年靠农产品原料生产——如面粉、植物油业大多已经倒闭，今年将轮到靠天然原料生产——如水泥、制碱的工业倒闭了。
