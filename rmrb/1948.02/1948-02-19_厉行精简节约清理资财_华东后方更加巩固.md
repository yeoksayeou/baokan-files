Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 17th: The East China Rear Area Consolidation Committee recently summarized the implementation and significant achievements of the three major plans—streamlining, thrift, and asset cleanup—over the past three months, stating that in November of last year, the East China Bureau High-Level Cadre Meeting passed a resolution to establish the East China Consolidation Committee under the leadership of the East China Working Committee. It established two groups, streamlining and reorganization, and asset cleanup, to lead and promote the specific implementation of each unit. The movement began in early November at the East China Bureau and the directly subordinate teams of the military region. In December, it swept across the field army, the rear units of Luzhong and Lunan, and the party, government, and military organs and troops of the Bohai area and various sub-districts. All units extensively promoted democracy, launched ideological struggles, and everyone exposed problems, confessed, and reflected until concrete implementation. To date, most units have entered the stage of establishing systems.

The summary pointed out the specific gains: (1) Streamlining the establishment: In the entire Bohai area, more than one-third of the personnel separated from production were streamlined, and thousands of cadres and tens of thousands of soldiers and miscellaneous personnel surged to the front lines or went to the newly liberated areas to work; after the livestock were concentrated, some formed large transportation teams, some were transferred to cavalry regiments, or enriched the front lines. (2) Cleaning up assets: The East China Working Committee and the directly subordinate units of the military region, as well as the rear units of Luzhong, Lunan, and the Field Army alone, cleared out more than 4 billion Beihai currency (the same below) (excluding medicine and communication equipment). The Bohai logistics department cleared out about 2.6 billion yuan. It is estimated that all assets in the Bohai area could reach more than 8 billion yuan, and the directly subordinate teams of the Bohai Military Region alone had as much as 12 billion yuan. This not only enriched the finances but also basically eradicated mountain stronghold mentality and unified and centralized materials. (3) In terms of lowering the standard of living and thrift: After the Bohai Daily implemented precise distribution methods, it saved 3.85 million yuan every day, and the annual savings could provide the entire year's vegetable expenses for 50,000 to 60,000 people. The military supply department's monthly cigarette expenses were worth more than 18 million yuan, which has now been completely cancelled. The military political department's public miscellaneous expenses in December last year were only one-tenth of those in September, but the work could still proceed as usual. From November last year to January this year, the military health department did not receive any expenses or rations, and even saved more than 40 million yuan. In particular, after canceling small kitchens and lowering the standard of living for cadres, the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity was restored.

The summary particularly pointed out that the implementation of the three major plans has more positive significance politically, economically, and ideologically. First of all: (1) It has reduced the burden on the people and improved the relationship between the Party and the masses. For example, the Bohai Daily can save more than 1.4 billion yuan a year, and Bohai area can reduce the burden of 150 yuan per person. (2) It has consolidated and strengthened the organization of the Party and the army, strengthened the Party's discipline, and educated the entire Party. In streamlining, the core leadership of the Party has been strengthened. After launching ideological struggles in everything through the Party's democratic congresses, all Party members have taken a step forward ideologically, organizationally, and politically. (3) It has cracked down on mountain stronghold mentality and severely punished corrupt elements. For example, the director of the 13th Hospital of the Military Health Department, the director of the supply department of the military officer training unit, and the production section chief of the First Military Sub-district of Lunan, and other corrupt elements have been punished. (4) It has enriched finances and stabilized prices. In particular, after unfreezing civilian labor, it has rehabilitated the productivity of the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 16th: The East China Field Army Liaison Office has achieved remarkable results in implementing the "Three Major Plans." (1) It streamlined from 47 units to 27 units, and from more than 7,800 people to 3,400 people, enriching the front lines with half of the original number of people. (2) It corrected the serious phenomena of corruption and waste in the past (such as a certain director squandering 400,000 to 500,000 yuan of public funds in less than two months), and established a style of hard work and simplicity. Now, most female comrades can bring their children to participate in labor production, and some are already self-sufficient. (3) It cleared out 1,704 silver coins, more than 29.08 million Beihai currency, and more than 30,000 jin of grain and flour that individuals had kept. During the movement, they adopted the "three questions and three comparisons" method to open the door of thought. The three questions are: "Is your contribution to the revolution greater or your enjoyment greater?" "Are there any places where you deceive the Party in the implementation of the Three Major Plans?" "Is your thinking and action keeping up with the current new situation?" The three comparisons are: compare with the lives of the soldiers at the front, compare with the lives of the masters (hired poor and middle peasants), and compare with the lives before participating in the war. In this way, examine thoughts and life, carry out strict ideological struggles, and correct the idea of forgetting one's roots.

    厉行精简节约清理资财
    华东后方更加巩固
    【新华社华东十七日电】华东后方整理委员会近总结三个月来精简、节约、清理资财三大方案的执行情况及重大收获称：去年十一月华东局高干会通过在华东工委领导下，成立华东整理委员会，并设精简整编与清理物资两个小组，以领导推动各单位具体执行，十一月初运动即首在华东局与军区直属队开始，十二月间在野战军、鲁中、鲁南后方单位，与渤海党、政、军各机关部队，及各分区全面轰动起来。各单位广泛发扬民主，展开思想斗争，大家检举、暴露问题、坦白反省，直到具体执行。迄今多数单位已进入建立制度阶段。
    总结指出具体的收获：（一）精简编制：全渤海区脱离生产人员精简了三分之一强，数千干部和数万战士、杂务人员涌上前线或赴新解放区工作；牲口集中后，有的成立了大运输队，有的调给骑兵团或充实了前线。（二）清理资财：仅华东工委及军区直属各单位及鲁中、鲁南、野战军等后方单位即达北海币（下同）四十亿余元（医药与通讯器财还不在内），渤海后勤部门约清出二十六亿余元，据估计渤海全区全部资财可达八十亿元以上，连渤海军区直属队就有百二十亿元之巨。不仅充实了财政，而且基本上铲除了山头本位主义，统一集中了物资。（三）降低生活水平与节约方面：渤海日报实行精确发行办法后，每天节约三百八十五万元，一年节约可供五、六万人的全年菜金。军供给部每月纸烟费折价一千八百余万元，现已全部取消。军政治部去年十二月的公杂费，仅值九月份的十分之一而工作仍能照常进行。军卫生部从去年十一月到今年一月的经费、粮草都没有领，还节存了四千余万元。特别是取消小伙房，降低干部生活水平后，恢复了艰苦朴素的优良传统。
    总结特别指出：三大方案之执行，在政治上、经济上、思想上更有其积极的意义。首先是：（一）减轻了人民负担，和改善了党与群众的关系。如渤海日报一年可节约十四亿余元，就此一项，渤海每人即减少负担百五十元。（二）巩固与加强了党与军队的组织，严肃了党的纪律，教育了全党，在精简中加强了党的核心领导，在一切通过党的民主大会上，展开思想斗争后，使全体党员在思想上、组织上、政治上都提高了一步。（三）打击了山头本位主义，与严惩了贪污腐化分子，如军卫生部十三院院长，军官教导部队供给处处长，鲁南一军分区生产股长等贪污腐化分子都受到了惩处。（四）充实了财政，稳定了物价。特别是解冻民力以后，休养了群众的生产力。
    【新华社华东十六日电】华东野战军留守处执行“三大方案”，成绩显著。（一）由四十七个单位精简为二十七个，由七千八百余人精简为三千四百人，将原有人数之半充实了前线。（二）纠正了过去严重的贪污浪费现象（如某处长不到两月竟浪费了公款四、五十万元），树立起艰苦朴素的作风。现在一般女同志都能带上孩子劳动生产，有的已能自给自足。（三）清理出个人保存的银币一千七百零四元，北海币二千九百零八万余元，粮食面粉三万余斤。运动进行中他们采用了“三问三比”方法，打开了思想的大门。三问即：“你对革命贡献大还是享受大？”“你执行三大方案中是否有欺骗党的地方？”“你的思想行动是否跟得上当前的新形势？”三比即：和前方战士的生活比，和主人（雇贫农中农）生活比，和参战前的生活比。这样来检查思想和生活，开展严格的思想斗争，纠正忘本思想。
