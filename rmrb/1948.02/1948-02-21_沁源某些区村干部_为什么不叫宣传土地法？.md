　　Why Don't Some District and Village Cadres in Qinyuan
  　Promote the Land Law?
    We welcome comrades from all over the border region who are participating in the land redistribution work to exchange work situations, exchange work opinions, study work problems, and concentrate opinions from various aspects and then solve them together with the greatest amount of space. Whether it is systematic or fragmented, whether it is materials or experiences; whether it is in the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing newsletters and diaries, any form is good, just write down what you want to say; don't use Party jargon and empty talk. Other comrades who have different opinions can also write letters to discuss. Each place has its own specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for everyone's reference. People's Daily Editors:
    (1) After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, we wanted to read it to the masses in the winter school in our village (Qinyuan ××× Village), but the chairman of the Joint Association, Qin Xuanwen, strongly disagreed and forbade it. He said: He was afraid that the middle peasants would eat and drink too much and not be good, waste production, and that poor hired laborers would not accumulate fertilizer and charcoal, save money, and not work hard and wait! He also said, "This is the instruction from the district, don't let the hired poor know." He also said to the cadres: "If the hired poor are read the land law, the hired poor will run ahead of the cadres, it will not be too late to read it during the land reform." (In fact, it is an idea to fool the people, afraid that the hired poor will know the land law and not be under his command.)
    The next day, we resolutely read the Outline Land Law to the masses in detail in the winter school. The hired poor were especially happy and listened with great interest. There was silence when reading the newspaper. After reading it, everyone quarreled: Some said, this is good, we can also share a good piece of land and live in a good house. Some said: If this is done, the good fruits cannot only be divided by the cadres, and gold and silver treasures must also be divided to us a little bit! Some said: If it weren't for Comrade Ersuo reading it to us, we would still be pressed under the stone slab. We will have a basis for speaking in the future, and we will no longer be manipulated by others! The hired laborer Wang Si'er said indignantly: I must kowtow to Chairman Mao when I see him, he knows our suffering so clearly!
    The next day, more people came to the winter school, and the mood was extremely high. Even the old man who never spoke usually spoke.
    Then the hired laborer Wang Si'er made a suggestion to Qin Xuanwen, the chairman of the Joint Association: "In the past, when fighting Qin Yun, my fruits should be more than yours. Why did you give me millet at that time, and you gave me an iron rod, a paper incense burner, and two mu of land? You took one mu of good land and gave me one mu of rotten land that was far away and not good." Qin Xuanwen was speechless. The next day, the hired poor chatted together and said: "Who would dare to give others this opinion in the past? If people said they would give you my family, they would not dare to say anything even if they suffered a loss. At the same time, they mentioned that Guan Hanwen, a cadre from the county's political office, sold three mu of bad land in Donggou to the iron worker Li Changsheng for a high price of three stone of millet. Last spring, he proposed to divide the fruits again, and as a result, he took away one mu of good land rented by Wang Youcai and divided it to him. Wang Youcai was very dissatisfied at the time, but he didn't dare to say anything.
    After that, we also met with Qin Genshuan, the village chief and chairman of the Farmers Association, and summoned all the hired poor in the administrative village to give detailed publicity and explanation on the Outline Land Law, supplementary measures, the letter to farmers, the letter to party members, and all the articles in the New Masses. Although it was only two afternoons, it played a great role. The hired poor are more united, which is specifically manifested in borrowing wheat for the New Year, giving way to each other, taking care of each other, and exposing the conspiracy to fill a family's hole with eight stone of wheat and destroy the unity of the hired poor (individual bad cadres advocated this and actively carried out activities). The hired poor Li Genhong said: "This is like a family." And pay attention to uniting the middle peasants, explain the land law to the middle peasants, so the phenomenon that individual middle peasants who like to eat and drink and are not frugal has also changed now. The hired poor are more active in labor, and are now working hard to accumulate charcoal to prepare for the New Year's entertainment.
    The first time I read the land law, Qin Xuanwen, the chairman of the Joint Association, said this because he was not satisfied with doing so: The hired poor are discouraged when they hear that the landlord is going to be divided the land, and they have no confidence in the struggle, and the middle peasants eat and drink too much and do not work hard. After investigation, there is no such phenomenon so far, and he said these are fabricated.
    The hired poor on the mountain want to move to the village to live, because the land on the mountain is too bad, and there is no harvest in drought. Usually rabbits, raccoon dogs (mountain rats), and pheasants cannot be resisted. The hired poor said: Can't we go back to the village and divide a good piece of land?
    (2) According to reports, the Central Bureau instructed that the Land Law should be well publicized in the New Year's entertainment, and the instructions of the troops system are also the same, but the district office instructs the villages to only publicize "three accumulations" and "production", and not to publicize the Land Law. I don't know why. But we are publicizing the Land Law in the New Year, and all entertainment revolves around this center. Some people also asked us questions, and we had to say that we would implement according to the instructions of the district. I don't know what is right.

　　沁源某些区村干部
  　为什么不叫宣传土地法？
    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加平分土地工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。人民日报编辑同志：
    （一）土地法大纲颁布后，我们要在驻村（沁源×××村）冬学里给群众念，可是联会主席秦宣文极不同意，不准念。他说：怕中农大吃二喝不好，生产浪费哩，怕雇贫不积肥积炭、节约，不努力生产等待哩！又说：“这是区上的指示，不让叫雇贫知道。”他还给干部们说：“给雇贫念了土地法，雇贫跑到干部头里了，土改时再念亦不迟。”（实际上是愚民思想，怕雇贫知道了土地法，不受他的指挥了。）
    第二天我们坚决在冬学里，把土地法大纲给群众详细念了一遍，雇贫们特别高兴，听的很起劲，读报时鸦雀无声，读完后大家就吵成一圪＠：有的说，这就好了，咱们亦能分圪丝好地住间好房子。有的说：要这样办，好果实就不能光是干部分，金银财宝亦得分给咱一圪丝丝哩！有的说：不是二所同志给咱们念，咱们还在石板底下压着哩，以后说话可有根据了，就不再受人的团弄了！牛工王四儿激愤的说：我见了毛主席就得给他磕个头，他对我们的苦处，就知道的这样清楚！
    第二天冬学里来的人更多了，情绪高极了，连素来不说话的老汉都说了话。
    接着牛工王四儿就给联会主席秦宣文提出意见：“过去斗争秦云，我的果实应该比你多，为什么当时给我分的是小米，你们给了我一根铁棍，一个纸香炉，二亩地，你把一亩好地拿去，给我一亩又远又不好的烂地。”秦宣文无言以对。第二天雇贫们在一起闲谈时说：“过去是谁敢给人家提这意见，人家一说就是把我家的给你，再吃亏亦不敢吭气。同时提到县政治处干部关汉文把东沟三亩坏地以三石小米的大价钱卖给铁工李长胜，去年春天却又提出分果实，结果把王有才租种的一亩好地夺去分给了他，当时王有才非常不满，可是没敢说什么。
    以后我们又会同村长、农会主席秦根拴，召集全行政村雇贫，把土地法大纲，补充办法，告农民书，告党员书以及新大众上所有文章做了详细的宣传、解释，虽然仅仅两个下午的时间，却起了很大作用，雇贫们更团结了，具体表现在借过年的麦子时，互相尽让，互相照顾，揭破了以八石麦子填一家窟窿，破坏雇贫团结的阴谋（个别坏干部这样主张，并积极活动）。雇贫李根洪说：“这就象个一家人了。”而且注意了团结中农，给中农解释土地法，所以原来个别中农，爱吃喝不节省的现象，现在亦转变了，雇贫们劳动更加积极，现正努力积炭，准备年关娱乐。
    第一次读了土地法，联会秦宣文因为不满意这样做，还这样说：雇贫们听到给地主分土地，都泄气了，没信心斗争了，中农们都大吃二喝，不好好劳动。经调查，直到现在并无这种现象，他说这些是假造的。
    山庄上的雇贫想搬到村里住，因山上的地太不好，天旱更没收成，平时兔子、狢狑（山老鼠）、山鸡就没法招架。雇贫说：就不能回村上分块好地？
    （二）报载中央局指示年关娱乐要好好宣传土地法，部队系统指示亦是如此，可是区公所指示各村只准宣传“三积”“生产”，不准宣传土地法，不知是何道理。而我们在年关却是宣传土地法，一切娱乐都围绕这一中心，有的群众也向我们提问，我们只好说照区上指示执行，不知到底怎样对。
