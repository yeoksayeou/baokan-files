Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 11th: Our Third Sub-district's local armed forces, in conjunction with the militia, are actively suppressing local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek supporters along the Yi (River) and Luo (River) areas, clearing obstacles to mass mobilization. From November of last year to early January of this year, they conducted a total of 173 battles, killing and capturing 446 local bandits and diehards, and seizing over 800 rifles. The militia and local cadres were exceptionally resolute and brave in the battles. On December 18th of last year, when militia member Zhang Yujing and eight others were mobilizing the masses in a village in Song County, they were surrounded by 100 local bandits and Chiang supporters. The nine men, with only three rifles and eight hand grenades, defended a building and stubbornly resisted for two nights and one day, with the encouragement and assistance of the masses, until a unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived and drove back the local bandits. The Political Department of the Sub-district Headquarters issued a commendation throughout the district.
