Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Yu-Shaan-E, 5th: In a certain administrative village in Nanzhao, the leadership closely combined the economic, political, and armed struggles of the peasants in the movement to help them stand up. This village includes fifteen natural villages, with a total of 701 households, of which 308 households have no house or land. In a preliminary investigation of 57 households by the work team, 41 households had no rice in their pots and lived by begging. The fifteen landlord households occupied more than 52% of the village's land. They also exploited the peasants with usurious loans and charged deposits for renting land. Politically, they were mostly Chiang Kai-shek's bandit township chiefs and Bao chiefs, extorting and plundering in every possible way.

The peasant emancipation movement began with visiting and listening to grievances. At the grievance meetings, four poor peasants recounted the crimes of a local tyrant landlord named Zhang. He was the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and the supervisor of the stockade construction. An old peasant named Jin said that Zhang wanted to demolish his house when building the stockade and that it cost him a lot of money to prevent it. Old Jin's family had no bedding, and he was heavily fined for being late during the night construction of the stockade. An old woman's son was forced to build the stockade and vomited blood from exhaustion. The entire village spent eight million yuan to build two pillboxes and a wall, all of which was paid for by the poor. Zhang charged a deposit of 200,000 yuan per mu for renting land. As chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, he also arbitrarily collected money from small vendors. An old man worked as a long-term laborer in Zhang's house for twenty years but was driven out without receiving a single penny. The masses cried as they spoke, and more and more people joined in. Seven groups were formed in the process of recounting grievances. After the grievances were recounted, they went to divide up the ill-gotten wealth of Zhang, the village's biggest tyrant landlord.

In the process of recounting grievances and dividing up the wealth, the poor peasants were organized. The peasants' association, with the poor and hired peasants as its backbone, gradually expanded, united the majority of the middle peasants, and constantly purified its ranks. It reorganized its organization three times in a row, emphasizing "one heart and one mind" and "no double-dealers." As a result, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, lackeys, and rich peasants who had infiltrated the peasants' association were purged.

Because most of the landlords had fled and bandits were active nearby, the masses immediately began to establish armed forces. After repeated screening of their backgrounds, the first batch of 33 people, armed with rifles, went out to search for landlords and local tyrants and to suppress small groups of bandits. After recounting grievances, dividing up wealth, and establishing armed forces, the morale of the masses was high. They changed from being afraid of the landlords returning to looking forward to their return so they could settle old scores and reclaim their land. However, a small number of peasants had not completely understood the situation, thinking that "if everyone rides in a sedan chair, who will carry it?" and "the poor and the rich are like fish and water, helping each other." The peasants' association then led the "digging up of the roots of poverty" and "class demarcation." During the digging up of the roots of poverty, they discussed why sedan chair carriers carried sedan chairs generation after generation and where the sedan chairs of the sedan chair riders came from. After discussion, it was clarified that land distribution meant "the land returns to its original owners." Then, in conjunction with the Land Law Outline, they studied and investigated the population, land, and other aspects of the entire administrative village. After three days and three nights of meetings, they clearly defined the boundaries between the peasants and the feudal exploiters. The hired peasants and poor peasants were even more united. In more than a month of struggle, the peasants distributed 776 mu of land, 331 rooms, more than 50,000 catties of grain, and many livestock, furniture, and cotton cloth. After dividing the wealth and land, they elected a democratic government. Now the peasants have truly become the masters of the village and are in charge of their own affairs.

    发动群众中经济、武装、政治斗争密切结合
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线五日电】南召某行政村农民翻身运动中，领导上把农民的经济斗争、政治斗争和武装斗争密切结合起来。该村包括十五个自然村，总共七百零一户中有三零八户无房无地。工作组初步调查的五十七户中，竟有四十一户锅里无米，靠讨饭活命。而十五户地主却占了全村土地百分之五十二强。他们并用高利贷盘剥农民，租地且收押金。在政治上他们又大都是蒋匪乡保长，敲诈勒索，无所不为。
    农民翻身运动先从访苦、诉苦开始。在诉苦会上，四个贫农诉说了该村恶霸地主张某的罪恶。他是商会会长，又是修寨子的监工。农民老金说张某修寨时要拆他的房子，花了很多钱才没有拆。老金家里没有铺盖，黑夜修寨误了时间，又被罚了巨款。一个老太太的儿子被逼着修寨，累得吐了血。全村修了两个炮楼和一道墙，花去八百万元，都是穷人出的。张某出租地的押金每亩达二十万元。当商会会长时又乱派小摊贩的款。有个老汉在张家作了二十年的长工，最后一个钱没有得着而被赶出来。群众边诉边哭，人愈来愈多。在诉苦中组成七个小组，诉苦后就去把该村大恶霸地主张某家的浮财分了。
    在诉苦分浮财过程中，贫苦农民组织起来了。以雇贫为骨干的农会逐渐扩大，团结了大多数的中农，不断的纯洁了自己的阵营，接连三次整理组织，强调“一条心”、“不要两面派”。于是就把混入农会的蒋匪特务、狗腿子、富农等清洗出去。
    因为地主大都逃出，土匪又在附近活动，群众当即着手建立武装，经再三审查成份后，第一批三十三人即背枪出外搜捕地主恶霸，清剿小股土匪。经过诉苦、分浮、建立武装后，群众情绪高涨，由过去怕地主回来一变为盼地主回来好算老帐，要回土地。但也有一小部分农民没有彻底打通思想，认为“都坐轿，哪有抬轿人”、“穷富就是水帮鱼、鱼帮水”。农会便又领导“挖穷根”，“划阶级”。在挖穷根时讨论了抬轿人为什么辈辈抬轿，坐轿人的轿是哪里来的。经讨论后弄清了分地就是“土地回老家”。于是再配合土地法大纲研究调查全行政村的人口、土地等。开会三天三夜，明确的划分了农民和封建剥削者的界限。雇贫农与中农更加团结。在一个多月斗争中，农民分得了七百七十六亩地，三百三十一间房，五万多斤粮食和许多牲口家具、棉布等。分浮分地之后接着选举了民主政权，现在农民真正成了村里的主人，当了家了。
