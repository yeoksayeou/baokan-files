[Taiyue News] At the end of last year, the Yuebei Prefectural Commissioner's Office inspected grain warehouses in various counties and discovered widespread and serious bureaucracy, resulting in significant grain losses and wasted labor. (1) Attention was only paid to procedures, not to storage. As a result, the amount of grain that was underweight and moldy was very large. Ten counties reported writing off over 7,100 *shi* of grain, and there are still 1,000 *shi* of rotten grain that has not been processed. In Pingyao, a single incident in the summer resulted in the loss of 4,000 *jin* of grain. Because the scales were not standardized and the transportation of the grain by laborers was poorly organized, one shipment from Tunliu to Anze lost 60,000 *jin* due to being underweight. Many warehouses were controlled by landlords, unscrupulous merchants, and bad elements, who sabotaged the work from within. For example, Hu Shengyin, the director of the Tianchi Warehouse in Pingyao, was a landlord who took several hundred *jin* of public grain for production. In the Han Zhuang Warehouse in Huoxian, cadres accepted several hundred *jin* of wet grain from landlords, which resulted in the spoilage of two cave dwellings full of wheat, and the government was previously unaware of this. In Zhujialing, Huoxian, there were still 3,000 *jin* of wheat stored, and in Fengcun, there were 4,200 *jin* of wheat stored, which were only discovered during a warehouse cleanup in the autumn. (2) Planning was inadequate, resulting in a great waste of labor. In Pingyao and Lingshi districts, the locations for storing grain were not planned in advance, and several rounds of moving and transporting resulted in the waste of over 10,000 units of labor. At the Yuwu Warehouse in Tunliu, due to a shortage of scales and inability to adjust, laborers who brought grain had to wait two days to deliver it. Laborers from Qinyuan went to Tangcheng, Hecheng, and Beiping in Anze to transport grain and found nothing, resulting in 600 to 700 lost workdays. (3) Preliminary investigations have revealed that various levels have inflated expenses, borrowed grain haphazardly, and hoarded grain, amounting to 40,000 *shi*. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office alone has inflated expenses and borrowed grain haphazardly to the tune of 1,000 *shi* over the years. Qin County borrowed 600 *shi* of public grain, and one district in Qinyuan used public grain to cover 220,000 yuan in expenses, with most counties hoarding grain. A district office in Lingshi recently spoiled 70 *shi* of hoarded grain. (4) The leadership often fails to see many problems or only shouts slogans without immediately thinking of ways to solve them. The underweight grain from Lingshi from previous years has not yet been written off. In Anze in 1944, grain in Matimao was buried for a year, and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office pushed it to the county, and the county pushed it to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and no one dealt with it, and the grain rotted more and more. In Anze, when transporting grain to Qinyuan in the summer, the accounts showed a storage of 6,000 *shi*, but the warehouse only actually contained 3,000 *shi*. When problems arose at various levels of government, they only shouted slogans and did not actively think of ways to solve them. This has now attracted attention, and efforts are being made to correct it.

    岳北仓库工作官僚主义严重
    烂掉粮食浪费民力
    各地都应深入检查
    【太岳消息】岳北专署在去年年底，检查各县仓库粮食，发现普遍存在严重的官僚主义，以致损失粮食与浪费民力甚大。（一）只注意手续，不注意保管。因此粮食脱秤霉烂的数目很大。十个县报销处理七千一百多石，还没有处理的烂粮也有一千石。平遥夏天一次即损失粮食四千斤。因为秤不统一，运粮民工又组织的不好，有一次从屯留往安泽运粮，就脱秤六万斤。好多仓库掌握在地主奸商和坏分子手里，从中捣鬼。如平遥天池仓库主任胡生银是个地主，拿了几百斤公粮搞生产。霍县韩庄仓库干部收了地主几百斤湿粮食，结果把两窑洞麦子烂坏了，过去政府就不知道。霍县朱家岭还存放有麦子三千斤，冯村存放麦子四千二百斤，直至秋天清理仓库时才发现。（二）计划不到，浪费很大民力。平遥、灵石区先没把存放粮食的地方计划好，搬来搬去运输几次，浪费民力一万多个。屯留余吾仓库，因秤少，调不开，民工送来粮食得等两天才能交了。沁源民工到安泽唐城、和川、北平运粮扑了空，误工六七百个。（三）各级浮支乱借和打埋伏的粮食，据初步清理，即查出四万石。光专署几年来就浮支乱借了一千石。沁县借出公粮六百石，沁源一区用公粮垫支款二十二万元，大部县份都有埋伏粮。灵石一个区公所最近即烂了埋伏粮七十石。（四）有许多问题，领导上总是看不见，或只是空喊，不马上想办法处理。灵石前几年的脱秤粮，到现在还没有报销。安泽四四年在马蹄凹的粮食，埋了一年，专署推县，县推专署，都不作处理，粮食越烂越多。安泽在夏天往沁源运粮的时候，帐上存粮六千石，仓库实在只存有三千石。各级政府发生了问题，都只是叫喊，没有积极想办法解决，现已引起注意，着手纠正。
