Weekly Comprehensive War Report
War report for the week of January 29th to February 4th:

Northern Front: On January 26th, the Northeast People's Liberation Army captured Xinlitun, a strategic town and railway junction of the Chiang bandits, more than 200 li west of Shenyang. The entire defending enemy, the 26th Division of the 49th Army, more than 9,000 men, was annihilated. The enemy's 49th Army, since its commander Wang Tiehan led three divisions to reinforce the Northeast last autumn, has been completely wiped out within only half a year. On the 27th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army advanced and occupied Goubangzi, an important connecting point on the Beining Railway Line. On the 31st, it captured Panshan County. On the same day, it captured Daling River, an important bridge on the Beining Line, more than 30 li northeast of Jinzhou. In the above three battles, a total of 1,900 enemy troops, including the 184th Division, were annihilated. Since the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale winter offensive, it has annihilated more than 58,000 enemy troops, recovered ten county towns and many important strongholds in a month and a half. This has not only led the war to the periphery of Shenyang, but also completely cut off the Chiang bandit's blood transfusion arteries. The important strongholds of the Chiang bandits such as Jinzhou and Yingkou are also increasingly exposed to our army. Chiang Kai-shek has transferred Fan Hanjie's army group, which was badly beaten by the East China People's Liberation Army, from Shandong to provide emergency relief, but Fan Hanjie's end will not be more brilliant than Wang Tiehan's.

A unit of our army in the Jin-Cha-Ji area, from January 18th to 21st, successively swept away the bandit and puppet Wang Fenggang's troops north of the Daqing River and successively recovered more than ten important villages and towns in Xiong County and Ba County, killing and capturing more than 670 enemy troops and destroying all the fortresses painstakingly built by the Wang bandits north of the Daqing River, and his plan to control the Xiong (County), Ba (County), and Xin (City) areas has completely failed.

Southern Front: The People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces and militia, continued to widely suppress Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and capture local bullies. In the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region, more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops and local bullies were successively annihilated and captured in Huangmei, Huang'an, and Yingshan in eastern Hubei, and Huoshan, Taihu, and Shucheng in western Anhui. On the 27th, Xixian County, on the north bank of the Huai River, was captured again, and the defending security team fled in panic. On both sides of the Longhai Railway in western Henan, our army annihilated more than 800 Chiang Kai-shek's local bandits in half a month from the 2nd to the 16th of last month, and once recovered Mianchi County on the 12th. Our local troops in Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu separately suppressed scattered bandits in Guoyang, Ningling, and Dangshan between the Ying River and the Huai River, killing and capturing more than 1,400 people in one month.

Local armed guerrillas in various places are also extremely active. In the coastal areas of northern Jiaodong, our guerrillas actively besieged Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Penglai, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, and launched a struggle against grain robbery, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops in the past month. Last month, on the 15th, the local troops of the Huaihai Sub-district in Central China launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the triangular area of the Longhai Railway, Suqian-Xin'anzhen Road, and the Grand Canal. On the same day, another unit of our army completely annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek's Taizhou Joint Defense Brigade on the Hai'an-Taizhou Line, killing and capturing more than 650 enemy troops in the two battles. On the 8th of last month, the Bohai Sea Defense Detachment, in coordination with the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army's large-scale raid, fiercely attacked Donggu, southeast of Tianjin, capturing more than 300 enemy troops and capturing strongholds such as Xiaozhan, Xianshuigu, and Gegu. The local armed forces in northern Jin repelled the intrusion of Yan Xishan's bandits in Xin County and approached the city of Xin County. The Jinzhong local armed forces crossed the Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway and launched widespread attacks in Yangqu, Qingyuan, Taiyuan, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, and Fenyang, attacking Yan Xishan's bandits, searching for Yan Xishan's henchmen, and rescuing the suffering people.

    一周综合战报
    一月二十九日至本月四日一周综合战报：
    北线方面：东北解放军于上月二十六日攻克沈阳以西二百余里之蒋匪战略要镇，及铁路交叉点新立屯。守敌四十九军二十六师九千余人全部受歼。敌四十九军自去秋由该军军长王铁汉率领三个师奉命增援东北以来，时仅半年，至此全军覆没。二十七日另部解放军进驻北宁线重要联接点沟帮子，三十一日继克盘山县城，同日又攻占锦州东北三十余里北宁线上之重要桥梁大凌河，以上三次战斗共歼敌一八四师等部一千九百余名。东北解放军自展开大规模冬季攻势作战以来，一个半月之间，共歼敌五万八千余，收复县城十座，及重要据点多处，不仅使战争引向沈阳外围，蒋匪输血动脉全被斩断，锦州营口等蒋匪重要据点，亦日益裸露在我大军面前。蒋匪由山东增调被华东解放军打得头破血流的范汉杰兵团前往救急，但范汉杰的下场并不会比王铁汉高妙。
    晋察冀我军一部自上月十八日至二十一日，连续扫荡大清河北匪伪王凤岗部并相继收复雄霸两城及重要村镇十余处，毙俘敌六百七十余人，摧毁王匪在大清河北苦心修筑之所有堡垒，而其控制雄（县）霸（县）新（城）地区之计划全告破产。
    南线方面：解放军配合地方武装、民兵继续广泛清剿蒋匪、捕捉土顽。鄂豫皖地区先后在鄂东之黄梅、黄安、英山，皖西之霍山、太湖、舒城等地境内歼捕蒋匪正规军土顽千余。二十七日再度攻克淮河北岸之息县城，守敌保安队落荒而逃。豫西陇海路两侧我军自上月二日至十六日半月间歼蒋记土顽八百余人，并于十二日一度收复渑池县城。豫皖苏我地方部队分别清剿颍水淮河间涡阳、宁陵、砀山等地散匪，一月内共毙俘一千四百余人。
    各地地方武装游击队亦极为活跃，胶东北海边沿地区我游击队积极围困蓬莱、烟台、威海卫市北等地蒋匪，并展开反抢粮斗争，一月来共歼敌三百多人。华中淮海分区地方部队上月十五日大举进剿陇海路、宿（迁）新（安镇）路、运河线三角地带之蒋匪，同日另部我军于海（安）泰（州）线上全歼蒋匪泰州联防大队，两役共毙俘敌六百五十余人。上月八日渤海海防支队配合晋察冀解放军大破击战，猛攻天津东南之东沽，俘敌三百余人，并攻克小站、咸水沽、葛沽等据点。晋北地方武装击退忻县阎匪侵扰，并逼近忻县城下。晋中地武越过太（原）汾（阳）公路，在阳曲、清源、太原、交城、文水、汾阳一带展开广泛出击，打击阎匪，搜捕阎匪爪牙，拯救受难人民。（新华社）
