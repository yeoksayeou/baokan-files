    Pay Attention to Landlord Women Drilling into the Troops
    Editor:
    Liu Zhiming, the biggest landlord in the first household of Wangzhuang Street, Bian Village, Xiguan, Zuoquan, is now working in the Third Company of a certain battalion (unclear) of the 68th Regiment of the Taiyue Military Region. On January 26th, he sent a messenger with a large horse back home to pick up his woman. His woman's name is Fengxian, and her maiden family is also a big landlord. There is no one else in his family except his woman. When his woman left, she sold the things in the house. The grain alone was sold for seven shi and two dou, totaling 100,800 yuan in foreign currency, and she took the money with her. Compare this, and see if any of the emancipated masses can average seven shi and two dou of grain per person? From this, the masses realized that the landlord was not thoroughly struggled against. In this redistribution, we must further investigate. I hope the Taiyue Military Region will investigate and clarify that such women should not be taken in. (Wang Xian) February 6th

    注意地主女人钻入部队
    编辑同志：
    左权西关编村王庄街第一家大地主刘智明，现在太岳区×旅六十八团某营（不明）三连工作，于一月二十六日派通讯员赶着一匹大马返家，接他女人。他女人名叫凤仙，娘家也是大地主。他家中别无他人，只有他女人一名。他女人走时，把家中东西卖了，只粮食一宗就卖了七石二斗，共合洋十万零八千元，将钱带走了。对比一下，看哪一个翻了身的群众每一个人能平均七石二斗粮食？由此群众认识到地主没斗透。在这次平分时还得进一步清查。我希太岳军区查明，不应收留这种女人。（王显）二月六日
