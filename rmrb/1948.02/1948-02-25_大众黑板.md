    ★ After more than two months of training, the Northwest People's Liberation Army has improved both its skills and its ideology, and is full of energy! At a rally, they vowed to advance into the KMT-controlled areas and also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, requesting that he quickly issue an order to attack the KMT areas and liberate the people of the Northwest who have not yet been freed.
    ★ Lanfeng City, east of Kaifeng, has been captured by our People's Liberation Army again, wiping out a regiment of KMT bandits. Furthermore, the KMT bandits who were fleeing from Kaocheng towards Kaifeng were intercepted and severely beaten by us, with over a hundred captured alive and seventeen vehicles seized.

    ★西北人民解放军练了两个多月的兵，练了本事也练了思想，劲头大得很！开大会发誓向蒋管区进军，还写信给毛主席，要求赶快下命令打到蒋区去，解放大西北还没翻身的人民。
    ★开封东边的兰封城又叫咱解放军打下来啦，消灭了蒋匪一个团。还有从考城向开封窜的蒋匪也叫咱截住痛打一顿，活捉了一百多，得了十七辆汽车。
