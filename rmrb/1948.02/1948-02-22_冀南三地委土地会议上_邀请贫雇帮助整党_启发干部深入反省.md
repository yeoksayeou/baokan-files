[Jinnan News] At the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee Land Conference, Guangping cadres underwent five or six days of self-reflection. Some comrades, due to insufficient understanding and a lack of humility, took detours. Later, four comrades with better understanding were found to give typical reports at the conference, and some poor and hired peasants were invited to offer their opinions at the conference. Zhang Xueyi, a comrade from a poor peasant background, reported first. He was a monk for six years as a child and had some rogue tendencies. After joining the army, he found a wife and didn't care about his Party relationship. He joined the revolution a second time, but was still hedonistic and corrupt, dissatisfied with his superiors, and felt he deserved credit. Unable to leave his wife, he forgot his roots, acting like a monk ringing the bell each day without sincerity, outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, and detached from his poor brothers. In his self-reflection, he recognized his mistakes. At the end of his report, he couldn't recall a single instance where he consciously did something for the poor peasants and began to cry, feeling very heartbroken. Other comrades from poor backgrounds were also moved to tears. Then, Wang Fengchun reported. His older sisters were sold far away, and he had to beg for food from the age of eight. Today, he had land, cattle, and a wife, and became a district chief, so he wanted to go home and enjoy himself. He said that for the sake of his wife, he protected his father-in-law, ignoring the life and death of the poor peasants. He hadn't spoken to poor peasants at his father-in-law's door, but when he gave one a brief word, that person was tied up by village cadres, and he was indifferent. At this point, he cried and couldn't speak. Half of the comrades in the audience shed tears. Li Mingyin, a middle peasant, reflected on how he suppressed activists, protected landlords, and helped landlords distribute their belongings when he was a village cadre. He realized that he was not worthy of being a Communist Party member and requested punishment. Poor peasant representative Bo Xiuzhu listened from the side and cried loudly, saying while crying, "You cadre comrades protect landlords and rich peasants, protect village cadres, without thinking that poor fathers and mothers are still hungry and cold...!" Another representative, Zhao Xichang, cried and said, "Everyone says they are working for us poor people, but some things haven't been done well. I have nothing to burn, and I have to gather firewood to boil water. When I didn't attend the meeting, the village cadres said I was backward and stubborn, and gave me fewer fruits." The speeches of the poor and hired peasants touched the hearts of the cadres from poor and hired peasant backgrounds, and many people in the audience cried for ten minutes. Tenant representative Zheng Wenhua said, "Only those close to the poor peasants can work for the poor peasants. In the past, when cadres entered the village, they only wanted to eat at the homes of the rich,嫌dirtying the homes of the poor. How could they know the suffering of the poor! What the cadres eat, drink, and wear, isn't it all from the people? Some people have forgotten that many poor peasants have nothing to eat now and are still hungry and cold. It's been several years since the liberation, and I am still being suppressed by some bad cadres and still dare not speak in the village. The labels of 'backward,' 'spy,' and 'bad egg' are still weighing on my head." Finally, the leaders spoke, asking comrades from poor peasants, middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants to reflect carefully. Many comrades received a great education at this meeting. One cadre recalled that in the past he looked down on those carrying dung baskets and scolded poor peasants as "backward," but today he realized that he eats and wears the people's things but hasn't done much for the people, which is very painful. Zhou Fengting said, "When there are some difficulties in my family, I always worry about them when coming to meetings. Now I realize that there are many people who are even more difficult than myself!" Most cadres said, "I used to think I deserved credit, but now I think I haven't done anything for the poor peasants, and I am guilty!" Many comrades received unprecedented enlightenment and education at this meeting, and their self-examination and reflection took a big step forward.

　　冀南三地委土地会议上
    邀请贫雇帮助整党  启发干部深入反省
    【冀南消息】在冀南三地委土地会议上，广平干部经过五、六天反省，有些同志因为觉悟不够，又不虚心，走了弯路。后来找了四个认识较好的同志在大会上作典型报告，还请了一些贫雇在大会上提意见。贫农出身的张学义同志首先报告。他小时候当了六年和尚，有些流氓意识，参加到部队上工作，找了一个老婆，就不要党的关系了。二回参加革命，还是享乐腐化，对上级不满，认为自己有功。又离不开老婆，就忘本了，当一天和尚撞一天钟，阳奉阴违，脱离了穷兄弟。他在反省中认识了自己的错误，报告到最后，想不起哪一点是自觉的为贫农办了事，痛哭起来，非常痛心。别的贫苦出身的同志也感动的哭起来。接着由王凤春报告。他姐姐妹妹卖到远处，自己打八岁就要饭，今天有了地，有了牛，又有了老婆，当了区长，就想回家享受了。他说到为了老婆，包庇丈人，不管贫农死活；在丈人门上没有和贫农谈过话，就给一个谈了一下，那个人被村干捆了一绳，自己漠不关心。说到这里就哭的说不出话来。全场一半同志都掉下眼泪。李明银是中农，反省了自己当了村干，怎样打击积极分子，包庇地主，帮着地主分散东西。认识到自己不够一个共产党员，要求处分。贫农代表薄修竹在一边听了，放声大哭，一边哭一边说：“您干部同志们包庇地主富农，包庇村干部，没有想穷爹穷娘还饿着冻着咧…………！”又一个代表赵希长哭着说：“大家说为俺穷人办事，有些事可没办好。我没烧的，拾把柴火才能烧开锅。没去开会，村干部就说俺落后、顽固，少分给俺果实”。贫雇的发言打动了贫雇出身干部的心，会场上好多人一直哭了十来分钟。雇佃代表郑文华说：“接近贫农的才能为贫农办事，从前干部一进村，光想往有钱家吃饭，贫农家还嫌脏呢，哪能知道贫农的苦处！干部们吃的喝的穿的，哪一样不是老百姓的？有些人忘了现在好多贫农没啥吃，还挨饿挨冻。翻身翻了好几年，俺还被一些坏干部压着，还是不敢在村里说话。‘落后’、‘特务’、‘坏蛋’的帽子，还老是在头上压着”。最后领导上发言，要求贫农、中农和地主富农出身的同志们好好反省。许多同志在这一个会上得到很大教育，一个干部回想过去看不起背粪箩头的，骂贫农“落后”，今天才认识到吃穿老百姓的，可是没给老百姓办多少事，非常痛心。周凤亭说：“自己家里有点难处，来开会老是挂念。现在才知道比自己难的还多呀！”一般干部都说：“从先认为自己有功，现在想想没给贫农办了事，是有了罪呀！”许多同志在这个会上得到空前的启示与教育，对自己的检讨反省推进了一大步。
