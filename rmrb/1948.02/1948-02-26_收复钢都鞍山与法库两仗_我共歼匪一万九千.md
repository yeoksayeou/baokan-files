　　Recovering Steel Capital Anshan and the Battle of Faku:
  　We Annihilated a Total of 19,000 Bandits

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued Operations Communiqué No. 24, announcing the details and preliminary battle results of the Anshan campaign as follows:
    Our field corps launched a general offensive on Anshan City, the steel center, at 7:25 AM on the 19th. Under the cover of artillery fire, the infantry charged bravely and broke through the enemy's main defense lines in the southeastern suburbs, including Shrine Mountain and Lishan, in just 15 minutes. Another unit of ours also occupied most of the area west of the railway at 9:30 AM and captured the puppet municipal government and the railway station. At this point, the fierce fighting gradually shifted to the struggle for the enemy's main fortified strongholds of reinforced concrete structures in the urban area, such as the steel mill, Dui Lu Mountain, Cuo Pan Street, and the Central Bank. By midnight on the 24th, all these strongholds had fallen into our hands, and the battle came to an end. Our army recovered Anshan County and completely annihilated the entire 25th Division of the defending 52nd Army, as well as the traffic police, mine police, and other units, totaling over 12,000 troops, with not a single enemy escaping, from the enemy division commander and deputy commander down. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: (1) Annihilated 12,997 enemies, including 2,439 killed or wounded, and 10,558 captured alive. Among the enemy officers above the rank of colonel who have been identified so far are: Hu Jinsheng, commander of the 25th Division of the 52nd Army; Luo Yuheng, deputy division commander; Li Lu, major deputy battalion commander of the field artillery battalion directly under the 52nd Army; Xu Qinzhang, major engineer battalion commander; Jiang Zhiyu, major deputy battalion commander of the 25th Division's transportation battalion; Jiang Dongshan, colonel director of the Anshan City Police Bureau; Mao Tiansuo, colonel commander of the steel company's guard brigade, and many others. Luo Yongnian, mayor of Anshan City, and many others were killed. (2) Captured: 107 cannons of various types, including 5 field guns, 2 mountain guns, 8 anti-tank guns, 4 flat-trajectory guns, 1 infantry gun, 29 mortars, 58 60mm mortars, 7 grenade launchers, 67 heavy machine guns, 248 light machine guns, 165 submachine guns, 3 anti-tank rifles, 5 rifle grenade launchers, 5,122 rifles and carbines, 1,067,557 rounds of various bullets, 7,602 rounds of various shells, 3,147 hand grenades, 34 vehicles, 246 mules and horses, 7 radio stations, numerous factories and warehouses, and countless other materials.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued Operations Communiqué No. 25, announcing the details and preliminary battle results of the Faku pursuit battle as follows: Our field corps, at the beginning of the winter offensive, launched a surprise attack to encircle Faku City, a satellite stronghold of Shenyang. The defending 62nd Provisional Division of the New 6th Army was in a desperate situation due to lack of food, coal, and suffering from hunger and cold. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, they once attempted to break out to the south but were blocked by us and forced to retreat. On the 17th, at dusk, they burned most of their ammunition, supplies, and civilian houses before abandoning the city and fleeing in a northeasterly direction, specifically taking remote and desolate paths, desperately struggling through the wilderness with snow up to their knees. However, when they fled to the Wafang area, less than 40 miles from the county seat, they were intercepted by our ambushing troops. The enemy, fearing ambushes in front and pursuers behind, dared not fight and dispersed to break out. After two days and three nights of blocking and pursuit, we finally surrounded the enemy in the Hejia Youfang, Dafang Shen, Liangzhongqiao, and Xiawazi areas between Faku and Changtu on the 19th. At 9:00 PM that night, we separately annihilated them. Except for a very small number of enemies who managed to escape to the Kaiyuan direction, the entire enemy division was wiped out, and our army immediately recovered Faku County. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: (1) Annihilated 7,238 enemies, including 1,220 killed or wounded and 6,018 captured alive. Among the enemy officers above the rank of colonel who have been identified so far are: Han Zhuohai, regimental commander of the 1st Regiment of the 62nd Provisional Division; Zhang Shaozeng, deputy regimental commander; Zhao Zhongfu, deputy regimental commander; Li Zuoping, major battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of that regiment; Zhao Zhenglai, major battalion commander of the engineer battalion; (name of the) regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment (to be determined), and many others. (2) Captured: 3 field guns, 5 mountain guns, 8 rocket launchers, 12 mortars, 51 60mm mortars, 27 grenade launchers, 312 light and heavy machine guns, 5 anti-aircraft machine guns, 339 submachine guns, 46 automatic rifles, 2,697 rifles and carbines, over a million rounds of various bullets, over 1,100 rounds of shells, 4 vehicles, 40 train cars, one enemy plane was damaged, and some other military supplies.
