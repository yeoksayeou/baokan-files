    Taiyue Administrative Office Issues Notice
    Strictly Prohibiting Landlords from Sabotaging the Land Law
    Advising Middle Peasants Not to Believe Rumors and to Focus on Production
    [Taiyue News] In order to strictly prohibit landlords and rich peasants from sabotaging the land reform, the Taiyue Administrative Office issued a notice to governments at all levels and peasants in various regions. The notice stated: Since the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, this office has announced to all regions that it must be resolutely implemented, and landlords and rich peasants are not allowed to engage in any sabotage. However, according to recent understanding, in many areas, landlords and rich peasants dare to disregard government laws and regulations and carry out various conspiracies and sabotage, such as transferring, dispersing, secretly selling, and damaging property and grain, slaughtering livestock, spreading rumors, provoking disunity among peasants, feigning diligence to deceive the masses, and even colluding with bad village cadres to create false struggles, and launching counter-attacks and sabotage against peasants and cadres. If strict measures are not taken immediately against such insidious and criminal means, it will inevitably cause very serious consequences. The notice stipulates: (1) Any landlord or rich peasant who launches a counter-attack, directly killing or sabotaging emancipated peasants and village cadres, should be immediately arrested, a people's court should be organized for public trial, and they should be suppressed. (2) Any landlord or rich peasant who colludes with bad village cadres to carry out false struggles, or kills emancipated peasants in the name of the masses, or confiscates their property, in addition to immediately arresting the landlords and rich peasant elements and bringing them to justice, the masses who are coerced should be educated through exposing the conspiracy of the landlords and rich peasants. (3) Any landlord or rich peasant who engages in destructive acts such as transferring, concealing, dispersing, selling, or damaging property, or slaughtering livestock, should be arrested and punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing sabotage of land reform promulgated by the border government. All public and private shops and cooperatives shall also not privately purchase any items from landlords and rich peasants; those who violate this will also be punished. (4) Landlord and rich peasant elements who create rumors and provoke disunity among peasants must also be thoroughly traced and arrested for legal action. (5) Agricultural associations and peasant masses in all regions and villages, especially hired and poor peasants, should consciously and voluntarily monitor all destructive acts of landlords and rich peasants. If discovered, they should be immediately stopped and reported to the local government. (6) Counties and districts should earnestly educate village cadres who have taken too many fruits, and return the excess fruits in full during the equitable distribution, handing them over to the masses for equitable distribution, and they must not be dispersed and destroyed. Otherwise, in addition to returning them in full in the future, they will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. At the same time, according to the section on middle peasant policy in Chairman Mao's report on the current situation and tasks, an explanation should be given to the middle peasants, stating that for the few well-to-do middle peasants who have a small amount of surplus land, only their small amount of surplus land will be moved during the equitable distribution, and their floating wealth, grain, and livestock will not be touched. This will reassure the middle peasants to concentrate on production and expose the rumors and provocative conspiracies of the landlords and rich peasants. After receiving this notice, governments at all levels should immediately publicize and explain it to cadres and the masses, and prevent the destructive acts of landlords and rich peasants.

    太岳行署发出通告
    严禁地主破坏土地法
    劝告中农勿信谣言安心生产
    【太岳消息】太岳行署为了严禁地主富农破坏土地改革，给各级政府各地农民发了一个通告，上面说：自土地法大纲公布以后，本署曾经布告各地，必须贯彻执行，不许地主富农有任何破坏行为。但据最近了解，仍有不少地区，地主富农竟敢不顾政府法令，进行各种阴谋破坏，如转移、分散、偷卖、损坏财产粮食，宰杀牲畜，散布谣言，挑拨农民间团结，假献殷勤迷惑群众，甚至勾结坏的村干部，制造假斗争，对农民及干部进行反攻及暗害等等。似此阴谋罪恶手段，若不立即采取严厉措施，势必造成很大恶果。通告中规定：（一）凡地主富农进行反攻，直接杀害或暗害翻身农民及村干部者，应立即逮捕，组织人民法庭公审，予以镇压。（二）凡地主富农勾结坏的村干部，进行假斗争，或借群众之名而杀害翻身农民，或没收其财产者，除对地主富农分子立即逮捕予以法办外，对胁从的群众，应从揭发地主富农的阴谋中给以教育。（三）凡地主富农有转移、隐蔽、分散、变卖、损坏财产，屠杀牲畜等破坏行为者，应依照边府颁布的破坏土地改革治罪条例，予以逮捕处分。各公私商店合作社亦不得私自收买地主富农任何物品，违者亦给以处分。（四）对制造谣言、挑拨农民间团结的地主富农分子，亦须彻底追根，予以逮捕法办。（五）各地各村农会及农民群众，特别是雇贫农，应自觉自动起来，监视地主富农一切破坏行为。如经发现，应立即予以制止，并向当地政府告发。（六）县区应认真的教育多占果实的村干部，将多占果实在平分中如数退出，交群众平分，决不可分散破坏。否则除将来照数退出外，并按情节轻重予以处分。同时根据毛主席目前形势与任务报告中对中农政策部分，向中农作解释，说明少数富裕中农有少数多余土地者，在平分时只动其少数多余土地，不动浮财粮食牲畜。使中农安心生产，揭破地主富农之造谣挑拨阴谋。各级政府接此通告后，立即向干部群众作宣传解释，并制止地主富农的破坏行为。
