    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: Berlin Dispatch: Anti-hunger strikes in the British and American joint occupation zone of Germany are spreading like wildfire. According to a United Press estimate, the zone faces the threat of 4,190,000 workers striking. The strike in the Ruhr area is continuing. Glass industry workers in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr area began striking on January 15 and are still persisting. Steel mill workers in Dortmund are also on strike because they have not received rations. The industrial committees of major cities in the Ruhr, the heart of German industry, have recently decided to hold a general strike of three million people from the 2nd if food supplies are not improved. 190,000 mechanical, transportation, and textile workers in Hanover have also announced that they will hold a general strike on the 3rd to protest the elimination of fat and bread rations. Industrial committees in Stuttgart have decided to declare a strike. The strike is also spreading to the entire Württemberg-Baden region. Ninety percent of the workers in Württemberg are already on strike. Due to the lack of improvement in the food situation, the health of workers in the joint occupation zone is constantly deteriorating, and the number of patients in the industrial areas is twice that of 1938.
