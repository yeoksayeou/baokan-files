    Organizing Mass Supervision to Oppose Bureaucracy
    (Excerpt from "A Brief Biography of Lenin's Life and Career")

    Lenin believed that organizing supervision and absorbing workers and peasants—especially women—to participate in this work was the most important thing. Comrade Stalin was appointed as the People's Commissar to preside over the State Supervision Department. In April 1919, Lenin wrote to Stalin, saying that the main tasks in supervision work were to conduct surprise inspections based on citizens' complaints, to take revolutionary measures against abuse of power and bureaucratic delays, and to improve labor productivity and increase the quantity of products. Lenin believed that the supervisory organs were a powerful tool for absorbing the working masses to participate in state work. To this end, the State Supervision Department was reorganized into the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection in 1920. Lenin discussed this with Stalin and wrote to him: "The aim is to absorb all the working masses, whether men or especially women, to participate in the work of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection."
    Lenin meticulously checked the implementation of this instruction (referring to the instructions of the Labor and Defense Council drafted by Lenin in 1921 to the local Soviets regarding the basic tasks of economic construction) in various places, believing that this was the beginning of the realization of the idea of ​​implementing mass supervision and having local authorities inspect the work of central agencies, and a method of attracting non-Party masses loyal to the cause of socialist construction to participate in state administration.
    Lenin believed that attracting the masses to manage the state was one of the most important tasks. He often taught that the Soviet regime should strive to attract all laborers, Party members and non-Party members, men and women, to actively participate in the cause of state construction and economic construction.
    While educating the masses, Lenin also learned from the masses. Lenin relentlessly denounced all those who looked at the masses with arrogance, attempted only to teach the masses but forgot that they must learn from the masses, understand their actions, carefully study and synthesize their practical struggle experience.
    Lenin had countless ties with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and he also perseveringly sought and strived to establish new connections. In January 1922, Lenin wrote to the editor of the "Poor Peasants' Newspaper": "Could you briefly indicate (at most two or three pages): How many letters from peasants has the Poor Peasants' Newspaper received? What important (especially important) and new things are there in these letters? What is the mood? Urgent issues? Is it possible to receive peasant letters once every two months?"
    Talking with workers and peasants, speaking at mass meetings, at the broad production representative meetings of trade unions, at the non-Party worker-peasant representative meetings, at the non-Party representative discussion meetings of various congresses, and at countless other meetings, talking with worker-peasant correspondents, studying letters—these were the sources of Lenin's contact with the masses.
    Extremely deep faith in the masses was Lenin's characteristic. Consolidating ties with the masses was the issue that Lenin constantly reminded the Party to pay attention to. "Only when we correctly represent the people's consciousness can we govern," Lenin said at the Eleventh Party Congress in the spring of 1922. The people knew that Lenin loved them, so they trusted Lenin infinitely. The workers said: "Lenin is ourselves."
    Comrade Stalin described Lenin's spirit of believing in the masses in his speech at the evening party of students at the Kremlin Military School with the following words: "Apart from Lenin, I don't know of another revolutionary who believed so deeply in the creative power of the proletariat, in the revolutionary appropriateness of the proletarian instinct..." Therefore, Lenin tirelessly advocated: Learn from the masses, understand the actions of the masses, carefully study the practical experience of the masses' struggle.
    Faith in the creative ability of the masses—this was such a characteristic in Lenin's activities, a characteristic that enabled him to understand the spontaneous forces and guide the movement of these spontaneous forces onto the track of the proletarian revolution.
    Lenin could not tolerate the habit of exaggeration and required that simplicity and humility be displayed everywhere, and at the same time he himself was a model of this extraordinary humility. The workers used the following sentence to describe Lenin's simple spirit: "As simple as truth." "This simple spirit and humble attitude of Lenin, this spirit of wanting not to stand out, at least not to attract attention and not to deliberately praise his lofty position—this characteristic is precisely one of the most powerful qualities of Lenin as a new-style leader of the new-style masses—the most "bottom-level" masses of simple ordinary human beings."
    Lenin believed that the state organs had a very important role in the nationwide socialist transformation and in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    Lenin fiercely opposed any delays and bureaucracy. He took all the most resolute measures against bureaucrats and those who delayed and bungled things. He instructed that the Soviet organs, which were responsible for fighting bureaucracy, must not take a formalistic attitude towards any issue. He demanded that cases related to delays and bureaucracy be submitted to the courts for trial, believing that judges must severely punish those guilty of delaying and bungling things. He instructed that judges must be "urged by the Central Committee."
    In September 1921, Lenin said in a special letter to the People's Commissar of Justice: During the autumn and winter, the Moscow court must try five or six cases of delaying and bungling things in Moscow, select "significant" facts, and turn each trial into a "political" case. Find several smart "experts" who are good at identifying delays and bungling things, they should be particularly good at "exposing the crime of delaying and bungling things"; issue an explanatory letter on punishing the crime of delaying and bungling things.
    Lenin could not tolerate deception, and he was especially severe with those who stole socialist property. He took the most severe measures against all phenomena of wasting public funds and stealing state property. Lenin was not deceived. He demanded straightforwardness and sincerity everywhere.
    In 1921, a Red Army soldier came to Moscow to report to Lenin that some staff members in the Don region were acting ultra vires and embezzling public funds for private gain. In his letter to Lenin, this comrade pointed out that these actions made the workers and working people deeply dissatisfied. Lenin immediately forwarded a copy of this letter to Comrade Molotov, the Central Committee Secretary; proposed that a special committee composed of several members of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and one or two dozen students from Sverdlov University be sent to the Don region, taking the person who wrote the letter with them, and those who were confirmed to have committed theft should be shot on the spot. Regarding the person who wrote the letter, Lenin wrote in a note to the secretary: "Find the author of the letter immediately, meet with him, comfort him, and tell him that I am ill, but I will urge the handling of the case he raised."

    组织群众监督反对官僚主义
    （摘录“列宁生平事业简史”里的一段）
    列宁认为组织监督，吸收工人和农民——尤其是妇女——来参加这个工作，是最重要的事情。任命为人民委员来主持国家监督部的，就是斯大林同志。一九一九年四月，列宁写信给斯大林说，在监督工作方面的主要任务，就是要根据公民控告来作突然的检查，要采取革命手段对付滥用职权和官场因循延搁的现象，要提高劳动生产率和增多产品数量。列宁认为监督机关是吸收劳动群众来参加国家工作的强大工具。为此目的，就于一九二○年把国家监督部改组为工农检查院。列宁曾同斯大林商量，并对他写道：“目的是：把全体劳动群众，无论是男人，尤其是妇女，都吸收来参加工农检查院的工作。”
    列宁非常细心检查各地执行这个指令（按指一九二一年列宁所拟定的劳动国防委员会关于经济建设事业的基本任务给各地方苏维埃的指令）的情形，认为这是他所提倡的实行群众监督和由地方检查中央机关工作的思想实现的开始，是吸引忠实于社会主义建设事业的非党群众来参加国家管理机关的方法。
    列宁认为吸引群众来管理国家是最重要的任务之一。他经常教导说，苏维埃政权力求把一切劳动者，党员和非党员，男子和妇女，都吸引来积极参加国家建设和经济建设的事业。
    列宁一面教育群众，一面又向群众学习。列宁无情地痛斥一切以高傲态度看待群众，企图只教导群众而忘记必须向群众学习，理解其行动，细心研究并综合其实际斗争经验的人。
    列宁有千丝万线同广大工农群众联系着，还坚毅地寻找并力求建立新的联系。一九二二年一月，列宁给“贫农报”的编辑写道：“是否可以简略示知（最多两三页）：贫农报收到了多少农民书信？在这些信中有什么重要的（特别重要的）和新的东西？情绪怎样？迫切问题？是否可以每两个月得到一次农民信件？”
    同工农接谈，在群众大会上，在职工会的广大生产代表会议上，在非党员工农代表会议上，在各代表大会非党员代表谈话会上，以及在无数其他会议上发言，同工农通讯员谈话，研究来信——这就是列宁同群众发生联系的泉源。
    极深刻地相信群众，就是列宁的特点。巩固与群众的联系——这就是列宁所经常提醒党来注意的问题。“只有当我们是正确代表人民意识时，我们才能管理。”——列宁于一九二二年春天在第十一次党代表大会上这样说道。民众知道列宁是爱护他们的，所以他们无限信任列宁。工人们说道：“列宁就是我们自己。”
    斯大林同志在克里姆里军校学生晚会上的演说中用以下的话来形容列宁确信群众的精神：“除列宁而外，我再也不知道有第二个革命者是象列宁那样深信无产阶级的创造力量，深信无产阶级本能的革命适当性的……。”因此，列宁就始终不倦地鼓吹着：向群众学习吧，理解群众的行动吧，细心研究群众斗争的实际经验吧。
    确信群众的创造能力，——这就是列宁活动中的这样一个特点，这个特点曾使他有可能来理解自发势力，并把这自发势力的运动引上无产阶级革命的轨道。
    列宁不能忍耐浮夸习气，要求到处都表现简朴精神和谦逊态度，同时他自己就是这种格外谦逊的模范。工人们用以下一句话来形容列宁的简朴精神：“如真理一样简朴。”“列宁这种简朴精神和谦逊态度，这种很想不露头角，至少是不惹人注目和不故意表彰自己崇高地位的精神，——这个特性正是列宁为新式群众——简单平常的人类最“下层”群众——的新式领袖最有力品质之一。”
    列宁认为，国家机关在全国社会主义改造中和巩固工农联盟事业中有非常重要的作用。
    列宁激烈反对任何延搁习气和官僚主义。他采取各种最坚决的办法反对官僚和延搁误事者。他指示说，负有同官僚主义斗争责任的苏维埃机关，对于任何问题都不可持形式主义的态度。他要求把关系于延搁习气和官僚主义的案件提交法庭审判，认为必须使法官严厉惩治延滞误事的罪人。他指示说必须“由中央来督促法官。”
    一九二一年九月，列宁在致司法人民委员的专信中说：必须在秋冬期间由莫斯科法庭审判莫斯科五六件延搁误事的罪案，挑选“显著的”事实并把每一次审判都变成“政治”案子。找几个善于鉴别延搁误事的聪明“专家”，他们应当特别善于“检举延搁误事罪”；颁布一种论惩治延搁误事罪的解释信。
    列宁不能容忍欺骗行为，而对于那些盗窃社会主义财产的行为尤极严厉。他采取最严厉的办法对付一切浪费公款和盗窃国产的现象。列宁是不受欺骗的。他到处都要求爽直和真诚。
    一九二一年有一个红军战士来到莫斯科向列宁报告，说在顿河省有某些工作人员越权行事和盗公肥私。这个同志在致列宁信中指出，这些行为使工人和劳动人民深为不满。列宁即刻把这封信的一份抄本转交中央书记莫洛托夫同志；提议由全俄中央执行委员会委员中指定几个人和一二十个斯维尔德洛夫大学学生组成一个特别委员会派到顿河区去，把写这封信的人随身带去，把那些证实为确犯盗窃罪者就地枪毙。对于写这封信的人，列宁在给书记的字条上写道：“火速找到来信作者，接见他，安慰他，告诉他说，我有病，但他所提出的案子，我是会督促办理的。”
