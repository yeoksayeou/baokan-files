　　[Our Newspaper's News] After the joint investigation team of the Border Government and this newspaper investigated the Wei Dianhua case in Xisu Village, Third District, Shahe (see yesterday's front page), it was found that the village's bad cadres organized a fake Poor Peasant League to conduct a fake "election" in order to evade mass sanctions and continue to manipulate the village's political power. Last lunar November, when district leaders proposed mobilizing poor peasants, village head Wei Jingsheng returned to the village and convened a meeting of four poor peasants, including Wei Jianxin, who dared not say anything, to discuss the establishment of the Xisu Village Poor Peasant League. The poor peasants attending the meeting did not understand, so Wei Jingsheng gave a speech on "poor peasants holding power," and then asked everyone to find poor peasants. The poor peasants attending the meeting did not know how to find them or who to look for. The village head said, "Find those who have worked as farmhands (long-term laborers), and cadres with good backgrounds can also be found." Everyone thought of one and asked the village head if it was okay? The village head said if it was okay, then find the next one. Nine were found in one night. In this way, public security officer Qu Xiuji and civil affairs committee member Zhang Wanqun also joined the Poor Peasant League, while village head Wei Jingsheng hid behind the scenes and began to play a puppet show.

　　After the "Poor Peasant League" was established, the first thing they did was "elect" village cadres. Under Wei Jingsheng's manipulation, Wei Shuhe was elected as the village head. He was only eighteen years old and had just returned from planting mountain land in Shanxi last year. He knew very little about the village, his family had turned over relatively well, and he had no opinions on the old village cadres. The masses called him "Little Village Head." The sixty-two-year-old poor peasant, Wei Laotong, was forgetful and could not easily find out the bad deeds of the past village cadres, so he was elected as the manager of the cooperative; Wei Tiansuo, a follower of the bad village cadres, was elected as the chairman of the farmers' association; and the old cadres all successively removed themselves.

　　After the new cadres were elected, the old village cadres immediately handed over their work. The cooperative had never settled accounts or distributed dividends, and the masses knew there was a problem but dared not raise it. The bad cadres decided to settle the accounts first and perfunctorily pushed it through. Wei Yuxin, the newly "elected" cooperative accountant, said, "The cooperative's accounts are a pot of mushy rice soup, pushing it on me, I didn't dare to take it, the accounts are still there!" Wei Laotong was old and worried after being elected as the manager, saying, "I'm forgetful, it worries me so much that I keep crying. I see through that the old cadres are making a fool of us." After the Little Village Head was elected, the superior cadres came to the village to work. The old village head, Wei Jingsheng, said, "Find the new village head! Our village elected a new village head long ago." In reality, the person in charge of the village was still Wei Jingsheng. The "Little Village Head," Wei Shuhe, was childish and didn't understand anything. He had to go to the old village head to ask and learn about any work, and ask for instructions on how to do things. The Little Village Head only dispatched meals and ran errands all day. Sometimes the old village head simply went to the district to attend meetings himself and then taught the Little Village Head upon his return. Wei Jianxin, the director of the "Poor Peasant League," had been a farmhand all his life and was an honest person who didn't say anything. The "Poor Peasant League" couldn't do anything without the old village head. Wei Jianxin said, "I have a bad memory at meetings. I can't say anything about the 'Poor Peasant League's' preparations for the meeting (meaning arrangement of work), so I always ask the old village head to arrange the meeting and announce it, he knows." Wei Chunliang, a poor peasant who was elected as the preferential treatment director, was estimated by the old cadres to be hard to control, so he has not been given any responsibility to this day. Wei Yuanlai, the militia instructor, was replaced because he dared to raise opinions and was sent by the old village head to study ironworking in another village.

　　Last year, the fruits of the struggle included a flock of sheep, twelve hundred catties of cotton, and six bags of grain. The old cadres wanted to divide the sheep, but they were not divided because the poor peasants opposed it. The cotton was divided equally at forty catties per household. The grain was said to be for filling pits. Qu Xiuji, the public security officer who participated in the "Poor Peasant League," received five dou, while Zhu Zhanmao's mother, a true poor peasant and family member of a martyr, did not receive a single grain despite not having enough to eat.

　　The "Poor Peasant League" developed twenty-seven members. Some people suggested that Wei Dianhua, Wei Xianfu, and other true poor peasants who had been struggled against by the bad cadres in the past should participate. Qu Xiuji, the public security officer, said, "I'd rather be shot than let them participate." On the contrary, he introduced middle peasant Wei Huibao to participate. In order to better control the "Poor Peasant League" from behind, village head Wei Jingsheng specially sent the shepherd Ma Xingjun to participate in the "Poor Peasant League" to inform him of everything. This person came from Tanhuacun and is either a deserter or an object of struggle whose situation has not yet been clarified. Wei Jingsheng kept him to settle down, gave him twenty-three mu of good land, and a courtyard. He bought him off to be his lackey. The "Poor Peasant League" has not talked about the Land Law Outline. The poor peasants do not know the Land Law and why they are participating in the "Poor Peasant League." The "Poor Peasant League," we don't understand what it does; we haven't heard of the Land Law, no one has read it to us. This is the answer given by Wei Yuxin, deputy director of the Xisu Village "Poor Peasant League," to the investigation team comrades.

　　Note: According to Comrade Zhang Zichao, head of the County Government Construction Section: Before and after the publication of the Land Law Outline in this county, the poor peasants were not well mobilized. Many villages organized "Poor Peasant Leagues," which were praised by the county magistrate. In fact, most of them were controlled and manipulated by certain bad cadres, attempting to evade mass sanctions. It is hoped that the Shahe County Party Committee will continue to investigate.

### 西苏庄坏村长怕群众起来反对他　组织假贫雇团打掩护

　　西苏庄坏村长怕群众起来反对他
  　组织假贫雇团打掩护
    【本报消息】边府、本报联合调查小组，到沙河三区西苏庄调查魏殿花案（见昨日一版）后，发现该村坏村干组织假贫雇团，进行假“选举”，以便逃避群众制裁，继续操纵村政权。去年阴历十一月，区领导上提出发动贫雇，村长魏景升回到村后，就召集了魏见心等四个不敢吭气的贫雇开会，讨论成立西苏庄的贫雇团。参加会的贫雇不懂，魏景升讲了顿“贫雇掌权”，就让大家找贫雇。参加会的贫雇不懂怎样找和找谁，村长说：“找做过觅汉（长工）的，干部成份好的也可以找。”大家想到一个，就问村长行不行？村长说行就算找下一个。一晚上找到了九个，就这样公安员曲修己、民事委员张万群也进了贫雇团，村长魏景升自己则躲到背后牵线，开始演起傀儡戏来。
    “贫雇团”成立以后，第一件事，是“选举”村干。在魏景升操纵之下，村长选了魏书和，他才十八岁，去年才从山西种山地回来，知道村里事很少，家里翻身较高，对旧村干没啥意见，群众称他为“小村长”。六十二岁的贫雇魏老同，忘性大，对过去村干部的坏事不容易找出来，被选为合作社的经理；坏村干的腿子魏天锁被选为农会主席；旧干部都陆续自己把自己撤换了。
    新干部选出来，旧村干就马上交代工作。合作社从来没有结过帐分过红，群众知道有问题也不敢提出，坏干部就决定先交帐，马马虎虎的推过去。新被“选”为合作社会计的魏玉心说：“合作社帐是盆糊米汤，往咱身上推，我没敢接，帐还搁着哩！”魏老同上了年纪，被选成经理后发愁的说：“我忘性大，愁的我光掉泪，我看透旧干部是闹咱。”选出了小村长，上级干部到村工作。旧村长魏景升说：“找新村长吧！俺村早选上新村长了。”实际上村上的负责人还是魏景升。“小村长”魏书和，孩子气，不懂事，有啥工作也得去找旧村长问一问，学一学，请示个做法。小村长一天只是派派饭跑跑腿。有时上区上开会老村长干脆就自己去了，回来再教教小村长。“贫雇团”主任魏见心，做了一辈子长工，是个不吭气的老实人，“贫雇团”有啥事也离不了旧村长。魏见心说：“开会我记性赖，‘贫雇团’布置会场（布置工作的意思），我说不上话来，都是叫人家旧村长给布置会场宣布宣布，人家懂。”选上的贫雇魏春良当优抗主任，旧村干估计到怕掌握不了，直到现在没叫他负责任。民兵指导员魏远来换上后，因为敢提意见，被旧村长支到外村学铁机去了。
    斗争果实中去年存下一群羊，一千二百斤棉花，六口袋谷子，旧村干要分羊，因贫雇反对没分成，棉花每家按四十斤均开了。谷子说是填坑，参加“贫雇团”的公安员曲修己一家就分了五斗，真正贫雇抗属朱占毛妈粮食不够吃，却一颗也没分到。
    “贫雇团”发展了廿七个团员，有人提议让过去被坏干部斗争过的真正贫雇魏殿花、魏贤福等参加。公安员曲修己说：“枪嘣了我，他们也不能参加。”相反的，他却介绍了中农魏会保来参加。村长魏景升为了更能在背后掌握“贫雇团”，特别派了羊工马兴君参加“贫雇团”给他通风报信，这人是谈话村来的，是逃兵或是斗争对象尚未查清，魏景升把他留下落户，分给他二十三亩好地，一座院。收买他当狗腿。“贫雇团”没讲过土地法大纲，贫雇不知道土地法和为啥参加“贫雇团”，“贫雇团”是干啥的，咱弄不清；土地法没听说过，没人给念过。这就是西苏庄“贫雇团”副主任魏玉心给调查组同志的回答。
    按：据县府建设科长张子超同志谈：该县在土地法大纲发表前后，贫雇没经过很好发动，许多村庄就组织了“贫雇团”，曾得到县长表扬，其实大都是被某些坏干部掌握操纵，企图逃避群众制裁的一种手段，希望沙河县委继续检查。
