Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Paris dispatch: The French reactionar government announced on the 25th the devaluation of the Franc, changing the exchange rate to approximately 225 Francs to one US dollar (compared to 119 Francs to one US dollar before the devaluation). According to a TASS report, the devaluation of the Franc was entirely dictated by US imperialism. As soon as the news of the Franc devaluation spread, the US State Department immediately "expressed its heartfelt approval" on the 27th. However, the reaction in Britain was filled with panic and unease. London insiders generally believe that the Franc devaluation will seriously affect Britain's economic position, create a crisis for the Pound Sterling and British exports, and may force the Pound to devalue. The Sunday Express exclaimed: "The Franc devaluation will give British exporters a ruthless blow, thereby increasing their difficulties in foreign competition." Even the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps, was greatly shocked.

The Franc devaluation has aroused strong opposition from the French laboring people. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) Central Bureau issued a special communique on the Franc devaluation on the 28th of last month, denouncing the Schuman government's criminal measures of selling out national interests. It pointed out that the devaluation has caused a new wave of speculation, which will result in soaring prices and further inflation. Communist Party member of Parliament, César, strongly stated during the discussion of the currency bill in the National Assembly on the 28th: "The Franc devaluation has made the entire situation unbearable." César angrily accused the Schuman government of "surrendering the entire trade to foreign capital." Okey, a Communist Party member of Parliament from Seine Province, pointed out: "The Franc devaluation, manufactured single-handedly by the United States, seriously affects the lives of all laboring people." The Franc devaluation has also become the focus of attack at the ongoing National Farmers' Conference. Luo Cher, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, denounced the evils of the Franc devaluation in his report, saying: "The devaluation will cause a disastrous rise in prices, and we will have to pay twice the current price for imported goods from the United States in the future." The French democratic newspapers unanimously condemned on the 28th, saying: "The monetary reform carried out by the Schuman government is watching Washington, not Paris and the French people."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Paris dispatch: The French Communist Party's L'Humanité recently commented on the Franc devaluation, saying: "This is a measure taken by the Schuman government in accordance with the instructions of the US State Department, completely in line with Washington's wishes." The newspaper pointed out: "The Franc devaluation will reduce the purchasing power of workers, reduce wages, wipe out the savings of farmers, and bankrupt small businesses." The newspaper revealed that the Franc devaluation is a preparation for US imperialism to implement the Marshall Plan, and is also one of the conditions for US "temporary aid" to France. Because the result of the Franc devaluation will double the purchasing power of the US dollar, thereby enabling the United States to cheaply purchase French factories.

The newspaper continued: Following economic surrender always comes political surrender. The "American Exporter" magazine published in Paris declared: France needs a leader, and also needs a year or two of compulsory military training, in order to educate the young generation of France to respect order and law. This is not surprising, because this army can replace the expensive US military. The newspaper then warned: "The Franc devaluation is the destruction of French national independence. From now on, France will not only no longer be independent in industry and military, but also no longer be the master of its own finances. Therefore, the current government has become a complete slave of US imperialism." The newspaper also said: "Political and economic submission to the United States is due to the fact that the pro-American faction in France has willingly cast itself into the net of slavery. They are now destroying the middle class, attacking the proletariat, hoping to lead the country astray, and paving the way for the de Gaulle faction." The newspaper concluded forcefully: "But the unity of the French people, the friendship of workers and peasants, and the alliance of all those who are being attacked by the pro-American faction will prevent the implementation of all such plans dictated by foreign countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 28th of last month: A movement to protect national industry from the invasion of US imperialism is unfolding throughout France. Now, committees to protect various French industries are being established everywhere in France. The committee to protect the aircraft and automobile industries has convened a meeting in Paris and resolved to denounce the reactionary authorities for their shameful defense of the US imperialist destruction of the French economy.

    舒曼听命美帝实行法郎贬值
    法劳动人民强烈反对
    全法展开保护民族工业运动
    【新华社陕北一日电】巴黎讯：法国反动政府于二十五日宣布实行法郎贬值，将法郎的外汇率改为约二百廿五个法郎换一个美元（按贬值前为一百十九个法郎换一个美元），法郎的国内价格则为约一百八十个法郎换一个美元。据塔斯社报导：法郎的贬值，完全由美帝国主义在发号施令。当法郎贬值消息刚一传出，美国务院即于二十七日“表示衷心赞同”。但英国的反映却充满着惊慌和不安。伦敦一般人士认为法郎贬值将严重影响英国的经济地位，造成对英镑和英国出口的危机，并可能迫使英镑贬值。星期快讯报惊呼：“法郎贬值将给英国出口商以无情打击，从而更增加它们在对外竞争方面的困难”。甚至连英财政大臣克利浦斯，亦大表震惊。法郎贬值引起了法国劳动人民的强烈反对。法总工会中央局于上月二十八日发表关于法郎贬值的特别公报，痛斥舒曼政府出卖国家利益的罪恶措施。并指出：贬值引起了投机的新浪潮，结果将招来物价的飞涨，并使通货愈加膨胀。法共议员赛萨二十八日在国民议会讨论通货问题法案时力称：“法郎贬值已使整个形势不能忍受”。赛氏怒责舒曼政府“已将整个贸易投降于外国资本”。赛纳省法共议员奥奎指出：“美国一手制造出来的法郎贬值，严重影响全体劳动人民的生活”。法郎贬值亦成为正在举行的全国农民会议的攻击中心。法共中委罗雪尔在报告中指斥法郎贬值的恶果称：“贬值将引起物价的灾难性上涨，我们将来必须以两倍于目前的价格，去支付美国进口的商品”。法国各民主报纸于二十八日一致谴责说：“舒曼政府进行的货币改革，眼睛是注视着华盛顿，绝不是看着巴黎与法国人民的。”
    【新华社陕北一日电】巴黎讯：法共人道报顷评论法郎贬值称：“这是舒曼政府遵照美国务院的吩咐，完全适合于华盛顿方面的愿望”的一种措施。该报指出：“法郎贬值将使工人的购买力降低，薪资减少，将农民的储蓄一扫而光，使小商人陷于破产”。该报揭露：法郎贬值是美帝国主义实行马歇尔计划的准备工作，也是美国对法“临时援助”的条件之一。因为法郎贬值的结果，使美元的购买力增加了一倍，从而使美国将能廉价购置法国的工厂。该报继称：继经济屈服以俱来的，总是政治的屈服，美国在巴黎出版的“进出口杂志”宣称：法国需要一个领袖，并且还需要一年或两年的强迫军训，以便教育法国年青的一代尊重秩序和法律。这是毫不足惊异的，因为这支军队可以代替花钱很多的美军。该报继即警告说：“法郎贬值是法国民族独立的毁灭。从此以后，法国不仅在工业和军队方面不再是独立的了，而且也不再是它自己财政的主人了。因此，目前的政府，已成为美帝国主义的十足奴隶”。该报又说：“政治和经济上对美的屈服都是由于法国亲美派自投奴役之罗网，他们正出而毁灭中产阶级，打击无产阶级，希望使国家走入歧途；并为戴高乐派铺平道路”。该报结语力称：“但是法国人民的团结，工农的友谊，以及一切正蒙受亲美派打击的人们的联盟，将阻止听命国外而定出的一切这类计划之实行”。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社巴黎上月二十八日讯：保护民族工业免遭美帝国主义侵略的运动，正在全法展开。现在法国到处纷纷成立保护法兰西各种工业的委员会，保护飞机及汽车工业委员会已在巴黎召开会议，并决议痛斥反动当局为美帝摧毁法国经济所作的可耻辩护。
