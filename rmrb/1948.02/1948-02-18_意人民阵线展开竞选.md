Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Rome - In recent days, the People's Democratic Front has held rallies and demonstrations throughout Italy, launching its election campaign. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti delivered an election speech in Pescara, strongly criticizing the Gasperi government for serving big capitalists and denouncing American aid as "placing Italy under American economic control and creating political control." Rasadi, leader of the Socialist Party's Rome branch, stated at a Rome conference: "The People's Democratic Front is the only way to save the Italian people; any other path will only lead to the rule of the dollar." Nenni, one of the leaders of the Socialist Party, vehemently criticized the Christian Democratic Party at a Milan conference for dragging the national economy into a serious crisis and attempting to turn Italy into a colony of American capital. In San Ferdinando in the province of Apulia, fascists attacked the local People's Democratic Front election rally, resulting in deaths and injuries. In response to the fascist provocation, the city of Foggia in Apulia province declared a general strike on the 11th. The Italian National Youth Congress held in Genoa on the 8th was attended by 15,000 delegates.

    意人民阵线展开竞选
    【新华社陕北十四日电】罗马讯：最近数日来，人民民主阵线在全意各地举行集会和示威，展开竞选。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在贝斯加拉发表竞选演说，猛烈抨击加斯贝利政府为大资本家服役，并力斥美国援助“使意国处在美国经济控制之下，并正在造成政治的控制。”社会党罗马党部领袖拉莎迪，在罗马大会上称：“人民民主阵线是拯救意人民的唯一道路，其他任何道路只能造成美元的统治。”社会党领袖之一南尼在米兰大会上痛斥基督教民主党将国民经济拖到严重危机的绝路上去，并企图将意大利变成美国资本的殖民地。在阿蒲里亚省山佛兰丁诺，法西斯袭击该地人民民主阵线竞选大会，死伤数人。为回答法西斯分子无理挑衅，阿蒲利亚省福查城于十一日宣布总罢工。八日在热那亚举行的意大利全国青年大会有一万五千名代表参加。
