Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, February 14th - In the Pingjinbao (Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding) triangular area, broad masses of farmers, under the protection of our army, have risen up to struggle against landlords and local bullies, and are equally dividing the land. After our army entered the newly recovered areas north of the Daqing River, it universally publicized the "Land Law Outline" and the "Message to Farmers" to the peasants. It also dispatched commanders and fighters to organize "Equal Division Teams," which, in conjunction with local cadres and armed work teams, suppressed reactionary landlords, confiscated the property of traitorous bullies, and distributed it to poor farmers. A certain unit protected farmers in thirteen villages to divide the land equally and penetrated the enemy contact zone to carry out propaganda and capture reactionary bully leaders. A certain unit went deep into villages inside and outside the Gou ditch of Baoding enemy city, a few miles from the city, and held forums for poor and hired peasants to publicize the land law. When besieging the enemy stronghold in Fanzhuang, our army fought while carrying out propaganda. Under the active protection of our army, some villages in the edge areas of Gu'an, Anci, and Ba County have convened conferences of hired and poor peasants to discuss how to stand up and divide the land, while some villages have already begun to divide the land equally and organize farmers' armed forces to protect the land division, persist in the struggle, and prevent reactionary landlords from colluding with bandit puppet troops to sabotage.

    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】平津保三角地区广大农民在我军掩护下，奋起向地主奸霸进行斗争，平分土地。我军进入大清河北新收复区后，就普遍向农民宣传“土地法大纲”和“告农民书”，并抽出指战员组织“平分小组”，结合地方干部、武工队镇压反动地主，没收奸霸地主的财产分给贫苦农民。某部俺护十三个村庄的农民平分土地，并伸入接敌区宣传，捕捉反动奸霸头子。某部深入保定敌市沟内外、离城数里的村庄，召开贫雇农座谈会，宣传土地法。围攻樊庄敌据点时，我军一面打仗，一面宣传，在我军积极掩护下，固安、安次、霸县边缘区有些村庄已召开了雇贫农大会，讨论怎样翻身分地，有些村庄则已开始平分土地，并组织农民武装、保护分田，坚持斗争，和防止反动地主勾结匪伪军的破坏活动。
