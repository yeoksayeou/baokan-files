    Strictly Prohibit Gambling
    Qin Bingyin, a civil affairs committee member from Qinliu Village, Gaoyi, came from a rogue background and became a cadre during the emancipation movement. He colluded with militiamen Qin Defeng, Feng Baohe, and Qin Gou'lian, and the four engaged in rampant gambling (playing pai gow). As a result, Qin Bingyin himself lost over 70,000 yuan in silver dollars. Unable to repay his gambling debts, he mortgaged two large trees, a pig, four dou of sorghum, and six dou of millet, totaling over 70,000 yuan in value. After the gambling was discovered, it was decided through discussion that they should return all the money they had won. At a mass meeting, the entire audience unanimously agreed that Qin Bingyin was corrupt and could not lead the masses, and he was removed from his position as civil affairs committee member on the spot.

    严禁赌博
    高邑秦留村民事委员秦炳银，出身流氓，在翻身运动中当了干部。他勾结民兵秦得风、冯保和、秦狗脸等四人，大肆赌博（推牌九）。结果秦炳银自己输洋七万余元，因无钱归还赌帐，即将自己的大树二棵、猪一口、高粱四斗、谷子六斗等共合七万余元，作了抵押品。赌钱被发觉后，经讨论决定，让他们将所赢之钱，全部退出。在群众大会上，全场一致认为秦炳银腐化成性，不能领导群众，当场撤去民事委员的职务。
