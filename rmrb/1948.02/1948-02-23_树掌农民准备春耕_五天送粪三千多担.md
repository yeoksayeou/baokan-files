　　Tree Palm Farmers Prepare for Spring Plowing
  　Over Three Thousand Loads of Manure Delivered in Five Days
    [Huguang News] Tree Palm Village launched a manure delivery campaign, delivering 3,500 loads of manure in five days, laying the foundation for spring plowing. Last December, Tree Palm Village formulated a manure delivery plan for this January, and began delivering manure on the second day of the new year. On the third day, led by hired and poor peasants, a village-wide manure delivery campaign was launched to lay a solid foundation for the victory of spring plowing. Zhao Xinshun, a poor hired peasant, said, "We've only just stood up, if we don't produce, we'll fall behind. This spring is short, and we'll have meetings in a few days, if we don't work hard for a few days, we won't be able to catch up." He led ten people and delivered 304 loads of stubble manure to the fields in four days. Wang Fu, who is sixty-four years old this year, also delivered twenty-five loads of manure to the fields. Zhao Yue, who is eighty-two years old, also accumulated more than one hundred loads of manure. Their actions greatly influenced everyone's mood. In five days, a total of more than 3,500 loads of manure were delivered. Zhao Xinshun said: "By the sixteenth or seventeenth, we must finish delivering the manure!" (Chang Ji, Wen Fu, Nong Shi)
