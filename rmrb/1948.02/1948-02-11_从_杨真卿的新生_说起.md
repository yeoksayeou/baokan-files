Starting from “Yang Zhenqing’s Rebirth”
Xin Shen

Two years ago, I once adapted an article by Comrade Wang Genliu, entitled "Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth," which was published in the People's Daily on September 7, 1946. The gist of the article was: "The people of Dinanbao, Handan, won the ideological struggle against the landlord Yang Zhenqing." Yang Zhenqing was one of the most famous landlords in Handan. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had been a lawyer, county magistrate, and provincial assemblyman. When the enemy arrived in Handan, he became the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. The masses complained to him, but without breaking down his landlord status economically or politically, he quickly "reborn." And he said with great emotion: "After decades of running around, I finally found the path of life thanks to the guidance of the masses. Although I am in my sixties, I am determined to follow the people with all my heart."… The article used a great deal of space to explain that he was an insightful and "just" "enlightened" landlord, while the just actions of the mass struggle were only written in a mere two hundred words.

Adapting this article took some effort. I wanted to show the greatness of the masses' power in this article, so that even such a big landlord was subdued. I also wanted to explain that even landlords could "sincerely and willingly" accept land reform, then, wouldn't land reform be more in line with "heavenly principles and human feelings"? I emphasized the latter point and deleted certain parts of the mass struggle.

During the process of reorganizing the ranks, I reflected on my landlord thoughts and feelings, as well as the "paper-shuffling" style of work. After studying this article again, I found that it was a product of the combination of landlord thought and a "paper-shuffling" style of work.

At the time, I believed that some landlords could be "reasoned with" without going through mass struggle, especially intellectuals, who could be more easily "transformed." That is to say, I once felt that a portion of the landlords should be retained. That's why I wrote this piece. At that time, I seemed to have a "basis" for thinking this way, and this "basis" came from my grandfather.

My grandfather was a landlord and also engaged in commerce. He served as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in my county for many years, and later, as he got older, he let my father take over as chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. He was the first local tyrant in my county. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he went to live in Beiping. I estimated at the time that this was an expression of his national integrity. I thought that if he had been willing to be a traitor, he would surely have been the enemy's first favorite in my county. It was because he was unwilling to be a traitor that he went to Beiping to "live in seclusion." When chatting with comrades, I often mentioned this matter. The implication was that I had such a good grandfather with national integrity; it seemed that my own face was also shining a bit. In fact, my father was still serving as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce at the time, sucking the blood and sweat of the peasants for the Japanese; my family became a large stone slab on the heads of the peasants. At that time, the Japanese occupied the city, and the People's Liberation Army was active in the countryside. Such a traitorous family would be punished by the people at any time. My grandfather saw this, so he handed over the task of oppressing and exploiting the peasants to my father, and took his concubine and the blood-stained money taken from the peasants to Beiping to live an obscene and shameless "peaceful life." I myself, as the son of a landlord, defended them for many years.

This kind of thinking has a long history. I remember that there were many "plaques" hanging on the gate of my house. These were the lickspittles who came to flatter my grandfather, either forced by his power or attempting to curry favor. Inside, there was a plaque with four large characters: "Saving the People from Water and Fire." Originally, my grandfather advocated the establishment of a "Public Security Water Association" (fire brigade) in my county, and he donated a considerable amount of money. This was considered "saving" the people from "fire." He also advocated building a large stone bridge on both sides of the Puhe River west of the city, and he also donated more money than others. This was considered "saving" the people from "water." So the plaque of saving the people from water and fire came out. This matter has long blinded me: repairing bridges and fighting fires, it seems that it is always a good thing. When studying, I carefully traced back to find that the means of exploitation of landlords (especially the kind of landlords like my grandfather who have power and influence) are sometimes very "sophisticated." The busiest place in my county is Beiguan, and many of the houses in Beiguan are my grandfather's. Of course, he is most afraid of fire. So he came forward to "advocate" and took out a little money he had exploited, and then lured and forced others to take out more money to set up a "Public Security Water Association." It was called saving everyone's fire, but in fact it was protecting his own house. Maybe he also tried to use this method to get a good reputation among some people. Building a stone bridge was because my family and my land were separated by the Puhe River. In the summer, when the water rose, it was impossible to pass at all. Building such a bridge with everyone's strength was beneficial to my family first. This is called being generous at the expense of others, making big money with small capital, which is a common trick used by landlords.

But I didn't think so in the past. I regarded his exploitation of peasants, shop assistants, and workers as normal (that is, a reasonable phenomenon), and regarded this "clever" method of exploitation as "merit," and regarded some lickspittles' flattery and drilling as the peasants still having a "not bad impression" of him. Standing in the landlord's position and looking at the landlord, I even regarded the landlord's sins as good deeds. These despicable and dirty tricks of the landlords cannot deceive the peasants. The peasants are drained of their marrow by the landlords, and they hate and are ready to eliminate this enemy at any time. In the land reform, they have already risen to carry out this elimination work. However, the landlord class firmly passed on their position, thoughts, and viewpoints to me. When I rewrote "Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth," in the depths of my mind, I was actually commanded by my grandfather. As a result, the peasants' struggle was lightly glossed over, and Yang Zhenqing was written as an enlightened gentry with vision and justice. When the peasants did not rise, the landlord class fiercely and barbarously oppressed the peasants. When the peasants had risen and wanted to eliminate the landlord class, it tried to disguise itself and evade in every possible way, trying to escape the revolutionary storm of the peasants. This is the landlord's conspiracy. In this matter, I played a role in lying for the landlord and deceiving the peasants. I have committed an irreparable sin.

This preliminary fragmentary reflection has made me further realize the danger of combining the "paper-shuffling" style of work with the landlord's position. The characteristic of "paper-shuffling" is to make something out of nothing, to make something small into something big, to distort the facts, and to exaggerate casually. For example, "Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth" wrongly emphasized his transformation and erased or weakened the mass struggle. The "paper-shuffling" style of work combined with the landlord's thought will fabricate falsehoods according to the landlord's requirements and format, although subjectively it may not have been that way at the time. I adapted this article in the hot weather, without even taking a nap, as if it was for work, as if it was quite hard. When studying, I checked myself and said that this article was a manifestation of landlord thought, and the comrades also said that this was a landlord's position. I said it all right in words, but I never admitted defeat in my heart. The reason was that my starting point was good, and it was not intentional to make a mistake. Later, after repeated thinking and the repeated help of comrades, I realized that my original landlord position had not changed. I was being controlled by it, and my view of the problem, my search for materials, and my estimation and judgment would all be biased. This is a natural result, and it is called class nature. This kind of nature is hidden and tenacious, so it is most harmful to the revolution. This layer of skin is the most difficult to peel off, because it is often wrapped in a "good intention" gold suit. I am willing to continue peeling off this layer of skin, until I dig out all the landlord's roots and completely eliminate them.

### 从“杨真卿的新生”说起

    从“杨真卿的新生”说起
    辛深
    前年，我曾经编改过王根六同志的一篇文章，题目叫作“杨真卿的新生”，登在四六年九月七日的人民日报上。这篇文章的大意是：“邯郸堤南堡群众向地主杨真卿的说理斗争胜利了。”杨真卿是邯郸有名大地主之一，抗战前当过律师、县长、省议员，敌人到了邯郸，当商会会长。群众向他诉了诉苦，还没有从经济上政治上把他的地主身份打垮，他很快就“新生”了。并且非常感慨的说：“几十年来的奔波，终赖群众的诱导找到了人生的道路。我年虽花甲，但本发短心长，一意跟着人民走。”……这篇文章用了很大的篇幅说明他是个有眼光、有“正义”的“开明”地主，而群众斗争的正义行动，却只写了寥寥二百多字。
    改编这篇文章，很费了些气力。我想在这篇文章中显示群众力量的伟大，以致把这么个大地主都压服了。又想说明连地主都能够“心悦诚服”的接受土地改革，那么，土地改革不是更合乎“天理人情”么？我强调了后面这一点，删掉了群众斗争的某些部分。
    在整编队伍的过程中，我反省了自己的地主思想情感，也反省了“客里空”作风，又一次研究了这篇文章，我发现它是地主思想和“客里空”作风结合的产品。
    当时，我曾经认为有些地主不必经过群众斗争，就能够“以理喻之”，特别是读书人，更能够比较容易的求得“转变”。就是说，我曾经觉得有一部分地主是应该保留的。所以写了这篇东西。我当时这么想，似乎还有“根据”，而这种“根据”是从我祖父那里找来的。
    我祖父是个地主，兼营商业。当过我县多年商会会长，以后年纪渐老，把商会会长让给我父亲。他是我县第一个豪绅，抗战以后，到北平去住了。我当时估计这是他有民族气节的表现，我认为他要愿意当汉奸，在我县保险是敌人第一个红人。他是因为不愿当汉奸，所以才到北平去“隐居”的。和同志们闲谈起来，常常说到这件事。言外之意，我有这么个有民族气节的好祖父；似乎自己脸上也跟着有了些光彩。实际上，我父亲当时还当着商会会长，替日本人吸吮农民的血汗；我的家庭成了农民头上的大石板。当时日本人占着城，人民解放军在四乡活动，这么个汉奸家庭，随时会受到人民的惩办。我祖父看到了这一点，所以才把压迫剥削农民的任务交给我父亲，自己带着小老婆和取自农民的血汗钱，到北平过荒淫无耻的“太平日子”。我自己以一个地主儿子的资格，替他们作了多年的辩护。
    这种思想由来已久。记得我家的大门上，挂着许多“匾”。这是狗腿们或迫于淫威，或企图钻营，来拍我祖父马屁的。里面有一块写着四个大字“救民水火”。原来我祖父倡导着在我县建立了一个“保安水社”（消防队），他捐了相当多的钱，这算“救民”之“火”。又倡导在城西瀑河两岸建筑了一座大石桥，他也捐了较别人为多的钱，这算作“救民”之“水”。于是救民水火的匾就出来了。这件事长期蒙蔽着我：修桥救火，想来总算是件好事。学习时细细的追想一番，我终于发现地主（特别象我祖父那种有权有势的地主）的剥削手段有时是很“高妙”的。我县最热闹的地方在北关，北关有许多的房子是我祖父的，他当然最怕失火。于是出面“倡导”，自己拿出一点剥削来的钱，再诱骗强迫别人拿出更多的钱，成立起“保安水社”，名为救大家的火，实际在保护自己的房子。也许他还企图用这种方法，在某些人当中，落个好名声呢。建石桥，是因为我的家庭和我家的土地被瀑河隔开了，夏天水涨，根本不能通行。借大家的力量修这么个桥，有利的首先是我家。这叫慷他人之慨，下小本赚大钱，正是地主经常惯用的手法。
    但我过去不是这么想。我是把他剥削农民、店员、工人的事情看作常态（就是合理的现象），把这种“高明”的剥削方法看成“功德”，把某些狗腿的吹捧钻营看成农民对他还“印象不坏。”我站在地主立场上看地主，竟把地主的罪恶也看成了好事。地主这些卑鄙龌龊的伎俩不可能骗过农民，农民被地主吸干膏血，他们痛恨并随时准备消灭这个敌人，在土地改革中，他们已经起来进行这个消灭的工作了。但是，地主阶级却把他们的立场、思想、观点牢固的传给了我，当我改写“杨真卿新生”的时候，在思想的深处，实际上是被我祖父指挥着的。于是，农民的斗争被轻轻带过去了，杨真卿被写成有见识有正义的开明士绅。地主阶级在农民没有起来的时候，凶狠野蛮的压迫农民，当农民既经起来，要消灭地主阶级的时候，它就想法伪装、多方躲闪，企图逃过农民的革命风暴。这是地主的阴谋。我在这件事情上，充当了一个替地主说谎的脚色，替他们欺骗了农民。造下难以补救的罪孽。
    这个初步的片断反省，已经使我进一步认识到“客里空”作风和地主立场相结合的危险性。“客里空”的特点是将无说有，以小作大，歪曲事实，随便夸张，象“杨真卿新生”中就错误的强调了他的转变，抹杀或减弱了群众斗争。“客里空”作风和地主思想结合起来，就会按着地主的要求、格式去作假，虽然当时主观上也许还是并不怎么样的。我改编此文是在热天，午觉都没睡，好象还是为了工作，好象也还相当辛苦。学习时，自己检讨到此文是地主思想的表现，同志们也说这是地主立场，我口头全都说对，心上却总不认输，理由是我的出发点还好，不是有意弄错的。以后经过自己的反复思索及同志们再三帮助，我才认识到自己原来的地主立场没有变，自己被它左右着，看问题、找材料、估计判断都会偏了，这是自然而然的结果，这就叫作阶级天性。这种天性隐蔽而顽强，因此给革命的危害最大。这层皮揭开最难，因为它常常是被“好心”的金装包裹着的。我愿把这层皮继续揭下去，一直到把地主根性都挖出来，彻底消灭了为止。
