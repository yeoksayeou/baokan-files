　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS, Prague, 21st: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party issued a declaration addressed to the working people of the country and the countryside, stating: "The government is unable to perform its functions normally and solve the most urgent tasks in the coming month. This should be entirely the responsibility of the government members of the National Socialist Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party." The declaration pointed out: The irresponsible behavior of government members of certain parties is becoming increasingly obvious. They attack the state security organs in order to cover up and protect the espionage activities that are currently active, which have reached a rare degree and prove a major conspiracy by domestic and foreign reactionary forces against our republic. These spies, praised as "dear people" by the National Socialist Party, were sent into our country from the West and are already engaged in the work of rebuilding the German secret general staff's espionage system. This political crisis, suddenly provoked by members of the central government, poses a threat to the republic by agents of foreign reactionary forces. The declaration continued: "The National Socialist Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Slovak Party have very clearly formed an anti-democratic and anti-socialist group, whose aim is to overthrow the people's democratic regime and hand over power to reactionaries. This reactionary behavior of the three parties is completed by the resignation of the ministers of those parties in the government. Therefore, the three parties have voluntarily become opponents of the government program." The declaration stressed: "The Communist Party's leading organs believe that it is necessary to immediately unite the forces of all working people to support the Gottwald government, which is now calmly sticking to its post and implementing all necessary measures to defend the people's democratic cause and domestic security, peace, and order." The declaration concluded by calling on "all working people in urban and rural areas, all workers, peasants, merchants, and freelancers, as well as all Czechs and Slovaks, to rise up to organize a consolidated national united front, resolutely support the Gottwald government, realize all the tasks inspired by the interests of the republic and the interests of our revolution, and strive for friendly alliance with the Soviet Union and other Slavic countries."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Prague dispatch: The inside story of the treasonous conspiracy case, which triggered the current political crisis in Czechoslovakia, has gradually come to light due to the joint communiqué issued by the Czechoslovak Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior on the 22nd. The communiqué stated: "The treasonous conspiracy was organized by Reichel, a murderer who has been wanted by the government for a long time. When the wartime Czech army was established in the Soviet Union, Reichel colluded with foreign intelligence agencies in the Soviet Union and cooperated with the Polish reactionaries who supported Anders. Soon after, he deserted and returned to the country to carry out anti-Soviet activities. In 1946, he was reported for crimes and fled to the American-occupied zone in Germany. According to the investigation, Reichel was indeed in contact with a number of traitorous military officers, conspiring together to overthrow the democratic government, and maintaining contact with foreign military intelligence agencies, providing the latter with intelligence and accepting the latter's orders. Reichel had officially begun planning an armed rebellion." The communiqué concluded: "The entire treasonous organization has been uncovered, and the masterminds of the crime, whose activities have lasted for nearly two years, have all been arrested." It is reported that the detailed content of the treasonous conspiracy case cannot be announced because it involves various foreign countries. It is also learned that former Deputy Prime Minister Ersin, a member of the Slovak Democratic Party, has been arrested. He resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister last autumn on suspicion of treason.

    捷共揭穿三反动政党叛卖行为
  　号召人民保卫民主事业
    叛国阴谋是由外国反动派指使
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社布拉格二十一日讯：捷克共产党中央委员会主席团，倾向国内城乡劳动人民发表宣言，内称：“政府已无法在今后一个月内照常行使职权，并解决最迫切的任务，这应由民族社会党、基督教人民党和斯洛伐克民主党的政府委员完全负责。”宣言指出：某些政党的政府委员不负责任的行为是越来越明显了，他们攻击国家治安机关，借以掩盖和保护目前已形活跃的奸细活动，这种活动已到达少见的程度，且证明了国内外反动势力反对我们共和国的重大阴谋。为民族社会党称颂为“可亲的人们”的这些奸细，从西方被派入我国，已经在从事重建德国秘密总参谋部特务系统的工作。这种由中央政府委员突然挑起的政治危机，造成国外反动势力代理人对共和国的威胁。宣言继称：“民族社会党、基督教人民党和斯洛伐克党十分明显地组成反民主反社会主义的集团，其目的在于推翻人民民主政权，把权力交给反动分子，这三党的此种反动行为，以各该党政府中的部长之辞职而告完成。因此，该三党已自甘为政府纲领的反对派。宣言力称：“共产党领导机关认为必须立即团结一切劳动人民的力量，以支持哥特瓦尔德政府，政府现正镇静地坚持其岗位，并实施一切必要措施以保卫人民的民主事业，和国内的安全、和平与秩序。”宣言最后号召“城乡全体劳动人民、一切工人、农民、商人和自由职业者，以及一切捷克和斯洛伐克人，起来组织巩固的全国统一战线，坚决支持哥特瓦尔德政府，实现一切为共和国利益和我国革命利益所鼓舞的任务，争取与苏联及其他斯拉夫国家的友好同盟关系。”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布拉格讯，作为此次捷克政潮导火线的叛国阴谋案内情，已因捷克国防部与内政部二十二日发表的联合公报而渐露真相。该公报称：“叛国阴谋系由为政府追捕已久的凶犯雷却尔所组织，当战时捷克军队在苏联成立时，雷却尔即与在苏联的外国谍报机关勾结，并和支持安德斯的波兰反动分子合作，不久他即开小差回国进行反苏活动，一九四六年因犯罪被告发，潜逃往德境美占区。据侦查结果，雷却尔确与若干卖国之军官有联系，共同密谋推翻民主政府，并与外国军事间谍报保持联系，供给后者情报，接受后者命令，雷却尔已正式开始策划武装暴动。”公报末称：“整个叛国组织已被破获，活动几达两年的罪魁，已悉数被捕。”据悉，叛国阴谋案详细内容，因涉及各外国，尚不能公布。另悉，前副总理斯洛伐克民主党员厄尔辛业已被捕，他在去秋即因叛国嫌疑而辞去副总理之职。
