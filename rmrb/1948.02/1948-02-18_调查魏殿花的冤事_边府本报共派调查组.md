    [This Newspaper News] After Wei Dianhua from Xisuzhuang Village, Shahe West, came to this newspaper to appeal against the injustice of being falsely accused of being a "special agent" by village cadres, this newspaper immediately assigned a dedicated person to conduct a three-day investigation and research. The nature of the incident was initially determined, and it was reported to the Border Government. The Border Government attached great importance to his matter and agreed to this newspaper's request to jointly organize an investigation team. A telegram was sent to the Shahe County Government to ensure that his family's situation in the village would not be affected by his secretly running away. Currently, the investigation team jointly formed by the Border Government and this newspaper, under the direct leadership of the Sixth Prefectural Committee of Taihang, has gone to Xisuzhuang to investigate the truth of the case.
