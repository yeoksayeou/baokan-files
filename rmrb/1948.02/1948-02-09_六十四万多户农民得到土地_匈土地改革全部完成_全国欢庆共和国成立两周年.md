Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Budapest dispatch: Hungary celebrated the second anniversary of the founding of the Republic with great enthusiasm on the 1st. Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Szakasits, stated in his speech at the celebration rally in Budapest: "The most solid foundation of the Hungarian Republic is the land reform and the consequent destruction of feudal rule. The Third Hungarian Republic has guaranteed the democratic rights of people of all strata." Szakasits declared: "The ten million people of Hungary are fighting together with the people of other democratic countries for the peace and security of the Danube River basin." Since the founding of the People's Republic of Hungary two years ago, it has crushed the anti-republican conspiracies of the Szálasi and Pfeiffer new fascist parties and consolidated the new democratic regime. At the same time, it is striding forward towards economic recovery. Due to the nationalization of all large industries and large transportation industries, and the high production enthusiasm of the working people, industrial output has increased month by month. At the beginning of 1946, it was only 35% of that of 1938, but it has now reached 90% of the 1938 level. In the past two years, pig iron production has quadrupled, and steel production has exceeded pre-war levels. The Three-Year Plan, which began on August 1st last year, is making great progress. All major industries have not only completed but also exceeded their monthly plans. One year before the Second World War, Hungary's machine tool production was only 5 million Hungarian Forints, but the value of machine tools produced under the Three-Year Plan will reach 220 million Hungarian Forints. The Three-Year Plan stipulates that the national daily average coal production should be 3,600 truckloads, but on January 29, the miners mined 4,158 truckloads of coal. The land reform was fully completed a few days ago, which is a festival for 642,000 new farmers, of which 371,000 were formerly farmhands or agricultural workers, and they have obtained land for the first time. The land reform increased Hungary's cultivated land area by 500,000 holds last autumn compared to the previous year, totaling 6.8 million holds. The number of cattle has increased by 38% in two years, horses by 49%, and pigs by 70%.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Budapest dispatch: The development of Hungary's coal mining industry is astonishing, and it has now reached the target for 1950, which is the target for the last year of the Three-Year Plan. Since the launch of the labor competition on New Year's Day this year, within a week, it reached the highest record of producing 4,011 truckloads of coal per day, and many coal mines have completed 200% of their plans.

    六十四万多户农民得到土地
    匈土地改革全部完成
    全国欢庆共和国成立两周年
    【新华社陕北七日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利全国于一日热烈庆祝共和国成立两周年纪念。匈副总理社会党主席斯查卡西克在匈京庆祝大会上演说称：“匈牙利共和国最坚实的基础，就是土地改革及因此引起的封建统治之摧毁，匈牙利第三共和国已保证各阶层人民的民主权利”。斯氏声称：“匈牙利一千万人民正与其他民主国家人民一起，为多脑河流域的和平安全而奋斗”。按匈牙利人民共和国建国两年以来，粉碎了苏略克和费菲尔新法西斯政党的反共和国阴谋，巩固了新民主政权。同时大踏步走向经济复兴。由于一切大工业与大运输业的收归国有，劳动人民高度的生产热情，使工业产量月月增加。一九四六年初仅为一九三八年的百分之三十五，目前已达一九三八年水平百分之九十。过去两年中铣铁增产四倍，钢产已超过战前水平。去年八月一日开始的三年计划正获得极大进展。一切主要工业不但完成而且已超过每月计划。二次大战前一年，匈牙利母机生产仅为五百万匈币，而在三年计划下生产的母机价值将达二亿二千万匈币。三年计划规定全国每日平均产煤三千六百车，但在一月二十九日，矿工们挖出了四千一百五十八车煤。土地改革已于数日前全部完成，这是六十四万二千户新农民的节日，其中三十七万一千户以前是长工或农业工人，他们第一次获得了土地。土改使去年秋季匈牙利耕地面积比前年增加了五十万匈亩，总数达六百八十万匈亩。牛的数目在两年内增加百分之三十八，马增加百分之四十九，猪增加百分之七十。
    【新华社陕北四日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利煤矿工业发展惊人，目前已到达一九五○年的目标，亦即三年计划最后一年的目标。自今年元旦展开劳动竞赛以来为时一周，即到达日产煤斤四千零十一车的最高记录，许多煤矿已完成计划百分之二百。
