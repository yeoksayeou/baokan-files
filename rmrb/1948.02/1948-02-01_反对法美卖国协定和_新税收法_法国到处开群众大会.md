Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Paris Dispatch: A wave of resistance against the Franco-American treacherous treaty and the oppressive new tax law is rapidly spreading throughout France. In Dunkirk County, northern France, 1,000 farmers gathered on the 27th, and with great indignation, passed a resolution strongly protesting the "Meyer Law." Mass rallies were held everywhere in Angers, Doudeville, and Souillac, fiercely attacking the Schumann government's anti-people actions. Associations of merchants, artisans, farmers, and freelance professionals in Souillac have unanimously refused to pay the new tax. A mass protest meeting of artisans, craftsmen, and small and medium-sized businesses was held in the Seine Province a few days ago. French Communist Party leader Duclos declared at the meeting: "The French Communist Party will support the workers' actions and fully oppose the Meyer Law." On the 26th, French Communist Party deputies submitted a bill to the National Assembly demanding the immediate abolition of the disastrous new tax law. The Franco-Soviet Friendship Association held a conference in Paris on the 21st. The chairman of the conference, Joliot-Curie, denounced "the conspiracy of the gold dollar imperialism to enslave France." He emphasized: "It would be a serious mistake to place all hope in the United States. France can only guarantee its independence by trading with other countries, including the Soviet Union." French democratic newspapers have also risen up to denounce the situation. L'Humanité wrote on the 25th that Schumann, Moch, Meyer, and their masters, the big capitalists, are dragging all levels of French society into poverty. The French government has never been so subservient to the orders of the United States as it is now. The Marshall Plan and the Meyer Plan have only one purpose: to destroy French agriculture, commerce, and small industry. The newspaper pointed out: "Unemployment has spread throughout France. In the construction industry alone, there are more than 180,000 unemployed." A large number of members of the Socialist Party are also deeply dissatisfied with the party's treacherous policy of completely following the reactionary authorities and selling themselves out. More than 60 members of the Globus Local Committee of the Socialist Party issued a statement on the 21st, collectively leaving the party. They condemned "the Socialist Party for betraying the cause of socialism" and announced: "We are loyal to the cause of working-class unity."

    反对法美卖国协定和“新税收法”
    法国到处开群众大会
    【新华社陕北卅日电】巴黎讯：抗拒法美卖国协定和残民的新税收法的浪潮，迅速蔓延全法。法北部敦刻尔克县一千农民于二十七日集会，满怀激愤地通过决议，大声抗议“迈耶法案”。昂斯、杜德拉和苏利斯等地，到处举行群众大会，猛烈攻击舒曼政府的反人民行动。苏利斯的商人、手艺工人、农民和自由职业者等协会，已一致拒绝缴纳新税。赛纳省于日前举行了工匠、手艺工人和中小商业者的群众性抗议大会，法共领袖之一杜克洛在会上宣称：“法共将支持工人们的行动，全力反对迈耶法案”。法共议员并于二十六日向国民议会提出一法案，要求立即废除引起灾难的新税收法。法苏友谊协会于二十一日在巴黎召开大会，大会主席居利力斥“金元帝国主义奴役法国的阴谋”。他强调指出：“把一切希望寄托在美国身上，将是严重的错误。法国只有与包括苏联在内的其他各国进行贸易，才能保证法国的独立”。法国民主报纸也纷起声斥。人道报二十五日撰文称：舒曼、摩许、迈耶及其主子大资本家们，正将法国各阶层拖入贫困中。法国政府从未如现在那样屈从于美国的命令，马歇尔计划和迈耶计划只有一个目的，即毁灭法国的农业、商业与小工业。该报指出：“失业已遍及全法，仅在建筑业中，失业者就有十八万以上”。社会党内广大党员对该党完全尾随反动当局卖身投靠的叛变政策，也大表不满。社会党格洛布地方委员会的六十余个党员，于二十一日发表声明，集体脱离该党，他们谴责“社会党出卖了社会主义事业”，并宣布：“我们忠实于工人阶级的团结事业”。
