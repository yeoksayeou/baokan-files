    Dongguan Production Good, But Turns Out to Be a False Report
    All Regions Should Seriously Inspect
    [Lucheng News] The First Production Team of Dongguan Village, Lucheng District (i.e., the team led by Wu委会主任杨毛孩, or Director of the Armed Forces Committee Yang Mao Hai), was previously considered the best of the four production teams in Dongguan Village. Every time they reported at the district office and joint defense meetings, the village cadres always said that all men, women, young, and old in the village were organized for production, and even those who were not moving were just lazy and difficult to motivate. The leaders, after hearing these reports, also believed that they had made achievements. Now, according to a careful visit and inspection by comrades working in the village, these good reports have turned out to be completely false.
    (1) Landlords Control Mutual Aid Rights, and the Masses Dare Not Speak Up - The Sixth Group has a total of twenty-five households. Bankrupt landlord Zhao Chuncheng holds great power in the group. He and twelve poor and hired peasants and four middle peasants share a draught animal and a cart. The money earned by the cart and animal belongs to him, the poor and hired peasants do not get a penny, and they even have to contribute four *dou* of feed and two *jin* of oil each month. Poor hired peasant and military dependent Shi Heshang said, "I have a share in this animal, but he doesn't let me pull the animal to turn the mill, only he is allowed to use it. He can scold anyone he wants in the group, and no one in the group dares to provoke him."
    (2) Cadres Only Pay Lip Service, and the Difficulties of the Poor and Hired Cannot Be Solved - Poor hired peasant Li Xicun said: "We can't compare with others. Their carts and horses are cheap and they have no difficulties. They earn money transporting goods outside every day, and we can only watch with envy." Hu Erzhi said: "I don't even have a house now, and I have to pay rent for the house I live in." According to the investigation, there are twenty poor hired peasants without housing.
    (3) Requiring Guarantors and Setting Deadlines, the Poor and Hired Cannot Get Loans - The First Production Team borrowed 250,000 yuan from the bank. It was stipulated that each person could only borrow 20,000 yuan, with a deadline of twenty days. As a result, the poor and hired were afraid that they would not be able to repay the loans on time and dared not borrow. Poor hired peasant Li Kedi said: "When organizing production this winter, I planned to sell bowls, but I didn't have any capital. I went to the cooperative to borrow money, but the cooperative cadre only said: You can only borrow 20,000, and you have to find a guarantor. At that time, I asked Yang Laifu to guarantee me, and I borrowed 20,000 yuan. Twenty days later, I had only collected 10,000 yuan from selling bowls. They gave me five more days, but I still didn't have enough, so I was forced to sell one *shi* of soybeans to repay the loan." Li Xiaohai said: "Three of us bought an ox and a cart. We used grain to buy the ox. It cost 80,000 to buy the cart. We asked the cooperative for a loan, but they only lent us 50,000. When the loan was due, we couldn't repay it, and they forced us to sell several *dou* of grain to repay the debt. People who have ways to repay on time can get loans from the cooperative. We can't repay on time, so the cooperative doesn't dare to lend to us."
    Based on the above situation, the cadres were asked to conduct a self-criticism. The director of the Armed Forces Committee said: "My work attitude in the past was just to brag every day, and I didn't personally go deep into leadership to understand the difficulties of the poor and hired. I just looked at the surface and thought it was okay, and I didn't know that there were so many problems inside. In the future, I must go deep to help the poor and hired." (Wu Changhong, Ma Lusheng)
    Landlords engaging in speculation, the poor and hired suffering losses, village cadres making false reports, and leaders believing it due to bureaucratic tendencies. And then they say: "Winter production has been started!" This phenomenon probably exists in more than just Dongguan Village. We suggest that everyone put down their airs, truly go among the poor and hired masses to inspect, truly rely on them, and think of some ways to help them. The time for winter production is not long, and we need to give it one last push.——Editor

### 东关生产搞的好原来是个假报告  各地都应该认真检查

    东关生产搞的好原来是个假报告
    各地都应该认真检查
    【潞城消息】一区潞城东关村第一生产大队（即武委会主任杨毛孩领导的大队），过去被认为是东关村四个生产大队中最好的一个。每次在区公所和联防会上汇报，村干部总是说全村男女老少都组织起来生产了，即有个别不动弹的，那都是懒汉，不好发动。领导上听了这种报告，也认为就是搞的有成绩。现据该村工作同志仔细访问检查，发现这些好报告原来全是假的。
    （一）地主掌握互助权，群众有话不敢谈——第六组共有二十五户，破产地主赵春成在组中掌握大权，他和十二户贫雇、四户中农伙着一个牲口一辆车，车和牲口赚下钱都是他的，贫雇农民得不上分文，并且每月还得贴四斗料二斤油。贫雇军属史和尚说：“这个牲口有我一份，牵上牲口推推磨他还不让，只许他一个人使。在组内想骂谁就骂谁，组内谁都不敢惹。”
    （二）干部光说嘴，贫雇困难不能解决——贫雇李喜存说：“咱不能和人家比。人家车马便宜，没啥困难，每天在外运输赚钱，咱在一边光眼气。”胡二只说：“我现在连房子也没有，住的房子还得给人家出赁钱。”据调查，没房住的贫雇就有二十个。
    （三）找保限期，贫雇贷不上款——第一生产大队从银行贷款二十五万元。规定每人只贷二万元，期限二十天。因此影响贫雇怕到期归还不了，不敢贷款。贫雇李喜的说：“今冬组织生产时，我计划卖碗，但又没本钱。我到合作社贷款，合作社干部科只说：只能贷两万，还让找了个保。当时我找杨来富保住，贷了两万元。二十天到期了，卖碗只凑了一万，人家又缓了我五天，结果还没有凑够，逼得卖了一石豆子才把款还了。”李小孩说：“我三人买了一头牛、一辆车。买牛出的粮食。买车花了八万。让合作社贷款，人家只贷给五万，到期还不起，人家逼得咱卖了几斗粮食，才算还了帐。人家有法的到期都能还了，合作社也敢贷给他。咱到期还不了，合作社不敢贷给咱们。”
    根据以上情况，便让干部来进行检讨。武委会主任说：“我过去的工作态度是每天光吹，就没亲自去深入领导，了解贫雇困难。光看到表面就算啦，不知道里边还存在这么些问题，今后一定要深入帮助贫雇。”（吴长洪、马潞生）
    地主投机捣鬼，贫雇困难吃亏，村干部作假报告，领导上官僚主义的信以为真。于是说：“冬季生产搞起来了！”这种现象，恐怕不只东关一个村子有。我们建议大家放下架子，真正到雇贫群众中检查检查，真正依靠他们，给他们想些办法。冬季生产时间已经不长，需要鼓最后一把劲了。      ——编者
