Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: The Tianjin Daily reports: Tianjin's industrial crisis is deepening. Among the city's twelve match factories, none are operating at full capacity. Beiyang and other match factories have already announced closure due to unsustainable losses. Danhua Match Factory, a relatively large factory, produces only about 50 boxes per day, less than a quarter of its original output of 220 boxes. The rubber industry has 54 factories (three of which are operated by bureaucratic capitalists). More than ten factories closed successively during the sluggish period before last year, in June and October. The current production volume of the remaining factories has been reduced to one-tenth of that of the previous two years. Among Tianjin's more than 190 weaving and dyeing factories, many have applied for closure. The average output of cotton mills has decreased by more than one-third. Furthermore, in Zhangjiakou, under the criminal rule of the bandit Fu, as many as 129 businesses closed down last month, an average of more than four closures per day. These included 16 textile businesses, 13 department stores, 12 leather businesses, 10 flour businesses, 8 civil engineering businesses, 8 daily necessities businesses, 6 grocery stores, and 6 metal businesses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to a compilation of news from Jiang-controlled newspapers last month: Under the occupation of the bandit Fu, prices in Zhangjiakou rose alarmingly last year. From the beginning of January last year to the beginning of January this year, the price of wheat increased 39 times, from 30,000 yuan per stone to 1.2 million yuan. The price of white flour increased 69 times, from 200 yuan per catty to 14,000 yuan. Ordinary white cloth also increased 13 times, from 125,000 yuan per bolt to 1.58 million yuan. Merchants were unable to repurchase the same amount of goods the next day with the proceeds from sales, leading to the bankruptcy of many stores. Under the heavy pressure of high prices, the general poor citizens were unable to make a living, and many impoverished people died of cold and hunger.

It is also reported: The people of Suiyuan are increasingly opposed to the bandit Fu. Since last winter, Chiang currency circulating in the market has often been found with anti-Chiang-Fu lyrics such as "Donations and conscription, they want money and lives, the officials are all full, only the common people suffer." The Fu family bandit gang is extremely alarmed by this and has strictly ordered the prohibition of this practice in various places, but to no effect.

　　天津工业停工减产
  　张垣商号倒闭一百二十九家
    【新华社陕北十八日电】津报消息：天津工业危机日深。全市火柴业工厂共有十二家，除北洋等火厂柴已因不堪亏累近已宣布倒闭停工外，没有一家工厂能全部开工，规模较大之丹华火柴厂，每日产量五十余箱，仅及原有产量二百二十箱的四分之一弱。橡胶业共有五十四家（内有三家为官僚资本所经营），有十余家工厂已于年前六、十月不景气时期相继倒闭，现其余各厂生产量均已减缩到前两年的十分之一。津市一百九十余家织染业工厂，申请歇业者极多，其中棉织厂产量平均已减少达三分之一以上。另息：傅匪罪恶统治下之张家口，上月份商号倒闭达一百二十九家之多，平均每日倒闭四家以上，内包括纺织业十六家、百货业十三家、皮业十二家、面食业十家、土木工业八家、日用品业八家、杂货业六家、金属业六家。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合上月蒋区报纸消息：傅匪侵占下的张家口，去年一年物价上涨惊人。自去年一月初至今年一月初，小麦价格上涨三十九倍，由每石三万元涨至一百二十万元；白面上涨六十九倍，由每斤二百元涨至一万四千元；普通白布也上涨十三倍，由每匹十二万五千元涨至一百五十八万元。商人售货所得，第二天即无法购回同量货物，许多商店因此破产。一般贫苦市民在高物价重压下，根本无法生活，不少赤贫因冻饿而死。
    另悉：绥远人民反傅匪情绪日增，自去冬以来，市面上流通之蒋币票面上常发现“捐款又抽丁，要钱又要命，官儿都刮饱，只苦老百姓”等反蒋傅歌词，傅家匪帮对此惊惶万状，严令各地查禁无效。
