    Payment Notice
    I. To our comrades, the correspondents of this newspaper: The payment for manuscripts for January has been sent out. Because many comrades are concentrating on land reform studies or have been transferred to new posts, the payments have been sent to the special commissioner's offices or county offices to which their original posts belonged. Please take note.
    II. To comrades from the Political Department of the Taihang Military Region, the 5th Military Sub-district Post Office, Ji Qing, Wen Yun, Jun Qing, Wei Guang, Mi Huan, and Yuebei People's Daily: Your sporadic manuscript fees for January, each below 300 yuan, are temporarily kept in our department. We hope you will continue to contribute articles so that we can accumulate them into a whole number and send them to you.
    III. Comrades Cui Dianchen and Jiang Sen: Please indicate your mailing addresses so that we can send your manuscript fees.
