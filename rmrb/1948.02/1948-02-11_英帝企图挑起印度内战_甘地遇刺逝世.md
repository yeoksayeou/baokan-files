Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: New Delhi dispatch: On January 30th, the 78-year-old leader of the Indian National Congress, Gandhi, was assassinated on his way to evening prayers. The assassin, Gaisede, was arrested on the spot. According to various sources, Gaisede was a Punjabi Hindu from Pune. On February 1st, the Bombay police also arrested five suspected accomplices to the assassination, including the general secretary of the Mahayana Buddhist order. The branch manager of the Punjab National Bank was also arrested on the same day for shouting "Death to Gandhi!" in a speech before Gandhi's assassination. After Gandhi's death, bloody incidents occurred between Hindus in Indian cities such as New Delhi and Bombay. Regarding the reason for Gandhi's assassination, Professor Zvavich of the Soviet Union stated in an article in the Soviet Literary Gazette on the 4th: "Gandhi's death should be blamed on British imperialism. British imperialism is trying to use this to incite civil war and prove its theory that the Indian people cannot govern themselves." It also pointed out: "Gandhi's assassination was instigated by British agents because Gandhi, although not actively resisting British rule, had been working to prevent a civil war artificially created by British imperialism." According to a report by the United Press on the 30th, Gandhi stated to Hindus during his last fast that "he would rather seek a glorious death than live to see India split due to the struggle between the Indian and Muslim parties." According to Agence France-Presse, the General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party, Joshi, sent a condolence message on the 1st, stating: "The Indian Communist Party extends its respect to Mahatma Gandhi for his contribution to awakening the anti-imperialist and democratic spirit among the masses."

    英帝企图挑起印度内战
    甘地遇刺逝世
    【新华社陕北九日电】新德里讯：上月三十日，七十八岁高龄之印国大党领袖甘地，于行赴晚祷途中遇刺逝世。凶手盖赛德当场被捕。据各方消息：盖赛德系来自蒲那的旁遮普籍印度教徒。二月一日孟买警察局复逮捕五名谋刺嫌疑犯，其中有大乘教团总书记等人。旁遮普国家银行支行经理，因在甘地遇刺前演说高呼“甘地该死！”亦于同日被捕。甘地死后，印度之新德里、孟买等城，均发生印度教徒间之流血事件。关于甘地被刺原因，据苏联兹伐维区教授四日在苏联文学报撰文称：“甘地之死，应由英帝国主义负责。英帝国主义力图借此挑起内战，并证明其所谓印人不能自治之理论。”并指出：“甘地之被谋杀，系英国特务所指使，因为甘地虽不积极反抗英国之统治，但一直在努力制止内战，而这种内战是由英帝国主义人工所造成的。”据合众社三十日透露，甘地在最后一次绝食中，曾向印度教徒表示：“他宁肯追求一个光荣解脱之死，不愿活着坐视印度因印回两党的斗争而分裂”。另据法新社讯，印共总书记约希一日致甘地吊唁，内称：“印共对圣雄甘地在群众中唤醒反帝国主义与民主精神之贡献，谨致推崇之忱”。
