    Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 31st: In the mass movement of the Seventh Sub-district, emancipated peasants cherish the wounded and sick of the People's Liberation Army and eagerly join the guerrillas and regular army. Peasants in a certain village once brought one million Kuomintang currency, four fat pigs, and many peanuts, and beat gongs and drums to express their gratitude to the wounded and sick of the People's Liberation Army. In two villages in a certain county, with the help of the work team, the armed forces of the landlords were disarmed, and the masses spoke out about their grievances and vented their anger. The masses immediately formed a guerrilla force, and after the troops moved, they persisted in the struggle and repelled the counter-attack of the landlord armed forces. A guerrilla force in a certain village grew from a dozen people to more than two hundred in a few days. Under the slogan of "Poor people want to turn themselves around, join the People's Liberation Army," some villages enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army. In a certain village, ten emancipated peasants voluntarily signed up to join the army in four days. In the half month that a certain regiment was active in the Biyang area, 89 young peasants voluntarily joined.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 30th: In order to prevent harassment by the Yan bandit troops, emancipated peasants in Guoxian and Daixian in northern Shanxi automatically established a crack guerrilla force of hundreds of young peasants within half a month, marched to the area bordering the enemy, practiced military exercises, and defended the land and the fruits of victory. At the joint peasant representative conference in the first district of Guoxian and Chengguan, hundreds of young peasants immediately signed up to join the army. Yuan Mantang, a young peasant from Sanji Village, and his brother eagerly signed up. Gao Rencheng, a peasant from Xitian Village, Daixian County, whose eldest son was honorably wounded and returned home in the patriotic self-defense war, now voluntarily sent his second son to join the army. Meng Wenxiu, a peasant from Xingaocun village, made meat dumplings for his son and said goodbye: "My family has been poor for three generations, and now we have finally turned ourselves around. Work hard and protect our good life." At the farewell meeting, the young new soldiers wore red cloth strips with the words "Peasant Soldiers" on their chests, and swore in unison to the fathers and brothers who were seeing them off, "We will not return home until we have defeated Yan Xishan."
