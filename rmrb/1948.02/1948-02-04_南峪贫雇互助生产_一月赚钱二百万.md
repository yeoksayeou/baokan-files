    Nanyu Poor and Hired Labor Mutual Aid Production
    Earns Two Million in One Month
    [Xiyang News] When the winter production in Nanyu, Second District, began, a meeting of the hired and poor was held to study the road to production this winter, followed by the opening of the Farmers' Association to recognize their own property and the famine. Some said that being organized was restrictive and not as free. Old man Li Sipei said: "Our labor cooperative organized ten poor hired and poor friends in February of this year to determine the management and cart pulling. At first, we were afraid of not benefiting; during the busy farming season, we also took care of seed. But in early October this year, when we settled accounts, we earned a total of 1.5 million yuan and 126 *shi* of millet (10 workers). The distribution was 20% for capital and 80% for labor, with 540,000 yuan divided among the 10 workers. Ten workers were absorbed, with a bonus of 360,000 yuan, and the rest was left to us." Military dependent Yang Jiude said: "It's really good to be organized! In addition to helping to plant 16 *mu* of land, I received more than 10 *shi* of millet. Our six worker families collectively bought three donkeys and two cows." Their experience is that true voluntary association, with workers and capitalists in agreement, allows everyone to find ways to operate. Of the 241 full and semi-laborers in the whole village, 88 were organized to pull carts and sell goods outside. Ten were hauling charcoal, ten were twisting hemp, and three were regularly collecting manure. Seventy-six were engaged in outside production. Currently, 187 people are involved in the movement, including those working outside. Within one month, 75 households of hired and poor and those who have turned themselves around earned a total of 1,791,600 yuan. Nineteen old middle peasant households earned 239,200 yuan.
    [Pingshun News] On December 22nd, the Pingshun Fifth District, Xi'an Shan Village, borrowed 170,000 yuan from the district credit bank and lent it to Chang Xi Wang and 14 other poor hired people, combined with 7 middle peasants to engage in transportation, led by Chang Lihong, with 12 mule carts, hauling salt from Xia County to Changzhi. One trip earned a gross profit of 1,081,000 yuan, and after deducting all expenses, the actual profit was 516,000 yuan. Now 14 mule carts have made a second trip. Recently, a meeting of poor hired, middle peasants, and village cadres was held to discuss and formulate a plan. This time, the bonus will be distributed to the poor hired to buy salt and coal for the New Year. The bonus distribution method is that the poor hired and middle peasants share together, with labor and capital clearly distinguished, so that no one suffers a loss. Finally, the political director said: "The gross profit we earn is equal to earning a bonus. Because the livestock and people are all paid for outside. It saves the grain and fodder at home."

    南峪贫雇互助生产
    一月赚钱二百万
    【昔阳消息】二区南峪冬季生产开始，即召开雇贫会议，研究今冬生产道路，连接开农会，认识了自己的家当与荒灾。有的说组织起来拘束不随便。李四配老汉说：“我们的劳力社今年二月就组织起十个贫雇穷朋友来，确定张罗、拉圈。开始以为怕不沾光；农忙时又顾养种。但在今年十月初算帐共赚一百五十万元，小米一二六石。（占工人十个）二八分红（资二劳八），工人十个分红五十四万元，吸收工人十个，分红三十六万元，其余就剩下俺啦”。军属杨九德说：“组织起来真正好！我除捎帮种十六亩地外，分下小米十余石，我们工人六家集体买驴三头，牛二头”。他们的经验，真正自愿结合，工人、资方心同意合，大家想办法经营。全村全、半劳力共二四一人，组织帮拉圈出外销售共八八人。驮烧十人，折麻十人，经常拾粪三人，在外生产的七十六人，现卷入运动的连出外共一八七人。一个月内雇贫及翻透身的七五户，共赚洋一七九一六○○元。旧中农一九户，赚洋二三九二○○元。
    【平顺消息】平顺五区西安善村，十二月二十二日，在本区区信用银号贷款十七万元，贷给常喜王等十四户贫雇，结合中农七人搞运输，由常里红带头，十二辆骡车，从夏县拉上盐运到长治。出卖一次赚毛利洋一百零八万一千元，除一切开支盘费外，实赚红利洋五十一万六千元。现在有十四辆骡车二次走了。最近开了个贫雇中农及村干部会议，大家研究讨论，定了个计划。这次回来要分红让贫雇过年买盐买煤等用，分红办法是贫雇中农一齐分，劳力资金全分明，谁也吃不了亏。最后政治主任说：“咱赚的毛利就等于赚上红利一样。因为牲口人全在外边开支。省下了家中粮食草料。”        （延庆）
