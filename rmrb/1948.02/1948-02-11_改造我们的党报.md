Transforming Our Party Newspaper
Peng Zhen

Our Party newspaper is a newspaper that serves the people, and it is also one of the important tools for realizing the Party's leadership. It is a weapon for guiding the Party and the masses in their ideological struggle against all kinds of errors and hostile ideas both inside and outside the Party. It is an ideological weapon for fighting the enemy, and also a weapon for the Party's criticism and self-criticism. The Party's leading organs must pay close attention to the leadership of the newspaper. Every word and every article in the newspaper represents the Party's voice and must be able to represent the Party. It is not a liberal newspaper, or a "natural expression" of idle-class literati who have nothing to do after eating and write whatever comes to their minds. Every word and every sentence in it must be useful to the people and beneficial to the people; it must be a newspaper that is responsible to the people and to the Party. Every word and every sentence, from content to form, must be truly beneficial to the people before it can be published; otherwise, it must be resolutely corrected and discarded. Our newspapers and the personnel engaged in journalism should thoroughly transform and improve themselves according to this standard.

All personnel engaged in journalism must wholeheartedly serve the people, act as filial children to the people, and diligently understand and comprehend the demands, thoughts, feelings, and language of the people. Only in this way is it possible to run a good newspaper for the Party and the people. We must use this as the standard to select a group of good Party members, strengthen journalism work, and form a strong journalism team that can serve the war and also shoulder the task of leading land reform. Comrades at all levels engaged in practical work should regularly be responsible for writing articles for the Party newspaper. On the other hand, current journalism comrades should go deep into the masses, participate in land reform, and learn from the workers and peasants to firm up their class stand and viewpoint and thoroughly transform themselves. Only in this way can the newspaper be run well and can the empty, formalistic work style that pervades the border region, poisons the whole Party, and harms the country and the people be eradicated.

The editing form, writing style, and language style of the newspaper should all be subordinate to the above-mentioned political tasks and political and ideological content. It should adopt a common language and common forms with the masses, establish forms that are easy for the masses to grasp and are familiar to the masses, that is, the masses' own forms, popularized forms. We should study our editing techniques from this perspective so that technology can more effectively serve politics and scientifically express content, rather than blindly following or imitating bourgeois technology. Even more, we cannot edit the newspaper from a purely technical perspective. Because our Party is not a party of classless aesthetics, our newspaper is not a purely aesthetic newspaper, but a revolutionary fighting weapon.

In order to transform our work style and transform all work, we must carry out criticism and self-criticism. We must commend the good and criticize the bad. Commending the good is, at the same time, criticism of the bad.

What is the purpose of commending or criticizing? It is to promote one thing and oppose another. Zhdanov, in his speech at the Soviet philosophical discussion meeting, pointed out that criticism and self-criticism are the driving force of the development of socialist society. There is no progress without the struggle of contradictions. The progress of our work is the same, and we must rely on criticism and self-criticism. We must adopt a serious attitude towards the errors and shortcomings in our work, expose and criticize them, and correct them. However, criticism and self-criticism are not simply exposure that discourages people, but are aimed at boosting morale, increasing confidence, and doing a good job. It is positive and must be positive. Only in this way will it not discourage people. Wasn't our land conference this time very critical? But we were not discouraged by this, but instead increased our confidence. Criticism should be in line with the facts, what should be negated, what should be affirmed, should be appropriate, and there must be active ways to improve. At the same time, we should not be afraid of being used by the enemy, that is, avoid abandoning criticism and self-criticism for fear of choking.

Our criticism and self-criticism should also follow the mass line. To truly follow the mass line, we must boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism, thoroughly transform our work style, and thoroughly transform all our work. Our newspaper should become one of the weapons for promoting criticism and self-criticism.

### 改造我们的党报

    改造我们的党报
    彭真
    我们的党报，是为人民服务的报纸，也是实现党的领导的重要工具之一，是指导党与群众的思想、与党内外一切错误及敌对思想作斗争的武器。是对敌斗争的思想武器，也是党的批评与自我批评的武器。党的领导机关，必须十分注意对于报纸的领导。报纸的每一句话，每一篇文章，都是代表党讲话的，必须是能够代表党的。它不是一个自由主义的报纸，或者是吃饱了饭无事干的、有闲阶级的文人们，想起什么写什么的“自然流露”。它的每一字、每一句都必须是对人民有用的和有利于人民的报纸，对人民对党负责的报纸。一字一句，从内容到形式，都必须是真正有利于人民的，才可以登载，与此相反的就必须坚决改正与抛弃。我们的报纸和从事新闻工作的人员，应该依此标准来加以彻底改造和提高。
    必须使一切从事新闻工作的人员，全心全意为人民服务，为人民当孝顺儿女，勤勤恳恳地体贴与领会人民的要求、思想、感情和语言，这样才有可能为党与人民办一个好的报纸。当必须依此为标准，选择一批好的党员，加强新闻工作，组成一个能为战争服务、还能负担领导土地改革任务的坚强的新闻工作的队伍。各级从事实际工作的同志，应该经常负责为党报写稿。另一方面，现在的新闻工作同志，应该深入群众，参加土地改革，向工人农民群众学习，以坚定自己的阶级立场和观点，彻底改造自己。只有这样，才能把报纸办好，才能肃清目前弥漫边区、流毒全党、祸国殃民的客里空作风。
    报纸的编辑形式、文风、语风，都应该服从于上述的政治任务和政治内容与思想内容，应该与群众采用共同的语言，共同的形式，树立为群众所容易掌握的和群众所熟悉的，即群众自己的形式，大众化的形式。应该以这样的观点研究我们的编辑技术，使技术更能有效地为政治服务，和科学地表现内容；而不是因袭或模仿资产阶级的技术。更不能以纯粹技术观点，来编辑报纸。因为我们的党不是无阶级立场的美术的党，我们的报纸也不是这样的一个纯美术的报纸，而是一个革命的战斗的武器。
    为了改造我们的作风，改造一切工作，就必须开展批评与自我批评。要表扬好的，批评坏的。表扬好的，对于坏的同时就是批评。
    表扬或批评是为了什么呢？是为了提倡一种东西和反对一种东西。日丹诺夫在苏联哲学讨论会上的发言，指出批评与自我批评是社会主义社会发展的动力。没有矛盾的斗争就没有进步，我们工作的进步，也是一样，要依靠批评与自我批评。我们对于工作中的错误和缺点，必须采取认真的态度，加以揭发批评和改正。但批评与自我批评不是简单的暴露，叫人丧气，而是为了提高士气，提高信心，把工作搞好。它是积极的，也必须是积极的。只要这样，也就不会使人丧气。我们这一次土地会议，还不是批评得很厉害吗？但我们大家并没有因此丧了气，反而使大家信心提高了。批评要合乎实情，哪些应该否定，哪些应该肯定，要恰如其分，并须有积极改进的办法，同时也不要怕为敌人所利用，即因噎废食，放弃批评与自批评。
    我们的批评与自我批评，也要走群众路线，真正走群众路线，就要放手的进行批评与自我批评，彻底改造我们的作风，彻底改造我们一切工作。我们的报纸应成为发扬批评与自我批评的武器之一。
