Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Berlin Dispatch: The Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) was held here on the 11th and 12th. In his report on the work of the Central Secretariat, Party Chairman Pieck pointed out that the Party's basic task is to fight for German unification and a just peace, and that it is particularly important to develop the German People's Congress movement. American and British imperialism, deeply fearing the growing size of this movement, have therefore issued bans in the Western occupation zones. Wendel, in his report on the task of mobilizing German intellectuals to participate in the democratic movement, said that the SED will do its best to consolidate the alliance between the working class and progressive intellectuals. Deputy Chairman of the Party, Ulbricht, reported on the Party's urgent tasks in the economic and democratization fields. He emphasized that the economic organs of the various states must cooperate with each other, and that these organs should be managed by the people. He pointed out that the urgent task of the SED is to concentrate all domestic democratic forces to fight for German unification and against the Frankfurt government under American protection, to fight against the colonization of Germany under the Marshall Plan, and to invite democrats to directly participate in the economic recovery work, accelerate the elimination of Nazi elements, and consolidate the achievements of land reform.

　　德统社党中央局全会
  　号召集中民主力量为德国的统一斗争
    【新华社陕北十九日电】柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央局第七次全会，于十一及十二日在此间召开。该党主席皮克在报告中央书记处的工作中指出：党的基本任务是为德国统一及正义和平而斗争，其中特别重要的是发展德国人民大会的运动。美英帝国主义因深惧该运动之日益增大，因此在西占区发布禁令。温德尔继报告发动德国知识分子参加民主运动的任务说：统一社会党将尽力巩固工人阶级与进步知识分子的联盟。该党副主席吴布利希报告该党在经济与民主化方面的迫切任务。他强调必须使各州经济机关相互配合，而这些机关应由人民来管理。他指出：统一社会党的紧急任务，是集中国内一切民主力量，为德国统一和反对受美国保护的佛兰克福政府而斗争，为反对在马歇尔计划之下使德国殖民地化而斗争，并邀请民主分子直接参加经济的恢复工作，加速肃清纳粹分子，巩固土地改革的成果。
