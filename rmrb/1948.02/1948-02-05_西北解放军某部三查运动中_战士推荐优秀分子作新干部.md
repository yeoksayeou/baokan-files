Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: In the "Three Check-ups" study movement in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, soldiers democratically discussed and recommended a large number of outstanding individuals, who were then approved by the administration and promoted to new cadres. The Fifth Detachment of the Fifth Regiment promoted 19 cadres, including one platoon leader, three deputy platoon leaders, one administrative chief, one clerk, five squad leaders, and eight deputy squad leaders. The criteria for cadre promotion in the Seventh Company were: (1) good class background and firm political stance; (2) capable and determined in combat command, and courageous in battle; (3) good mass discipline and battlefield discipline; (4) caring for soldiers, unbiased in education and management; (5) practical in work and able to endure hardship; (6) able to unite people, not arrogant, and not putting on airs. Kang Leiren, a communication soldier of the Ninth Company of the Sixth Detachment, was recommended and promoted to deputy platoon leader of the First Platoon. At first, he was a little timid, feeling that he could not speak well and could not lead. Deputy Company Commander Zhang Yinsheng explained, "Difficulties can be solved. I will help you lead the drill for a few days, and you can lead after you learn it. If you can't guide a platoon all at once, start by guiding a squad and discuss with the platoon leader more." Company Commander Xu Wenke encouraged him, "We are from poor backgrounds and don't emphasize being good at talking. As long as you can work practically, that's right. Improve yourself. If you don't take responsibility now, you still won't be able to do it in a few years." Kang Leiren gained confidence and bravely took on the responsibility, participating in discussion meetings in the squad and understanding the situation of his platoon. In the "Three Check-ups" movement, the unit also actively reorganized the Party branches. A large number of poor and middle peasant soldiers gloriously joined the Communist Party, and the Party work in the company took on a new look. The Fifth Company of the Fifth Detachment developed 15 Party members this time, and other companies are also continuously accepting soldiers' requests to join the Party. Soldiers Hao Fuhai and Yu Fuxing, who were from poor backgrounds, felt very honored after joining the Party and resolutely swore, "We will never go home until Chiang Kai-shek is completely overthrown and the feudal landlords are eliminated." After the company branch increased its new blood, its work became very active. Some established reading groups to strengthen current affairs education, and some companies established new working systems, such as squad leaders and platoon leaders discussing and studying with Party members or Party group leaders in their squads or platoons before planning work or handling problems, thereby closely integrating their work. In the process of mobilizing the masses in the company to discuss and review the conditions for new Party members to join the Party, not only was the purity of the Party organization guaranteed, but also the political awareness and class consciousness of the general soldiers were educated and improved.

    西北解放军某部三查运动中
    战士推荐优秀分子作新干部
    【新华社西北三日电】解放军某部三查学习运动中，战士以民主讨论的方式推荐大批优秀分子，经行政批准提拔为新干部。五支队五运提拔了十九个干部，计一个排长、三个副排长、一个事务长、一个事务员、五个班长、八个副班长。七连提拔干部标准是：（一）成份好政治坚定；（二）战斗指挥有能力有决心，作战勇敢；（三）群众纪律和战场纪律均好；（四）关心战士，教育管理不偏心；（五）工作踏实，能吃苦；（六）能团结人，不自高自大，不摆架子。该部六支队九连通讯员康乐仁被大家推选提拔为一排副排长，开始他有些胆怯，觉得自己不会说话不会领导，副连长张寅生解释说：“困难可以解决，我先帮你带几天操，学会了你再带，一下指导不了一个排，先指导一个班，多同排长商量”。连长徐文克鼓励他说：“咱们穷人出身不讲究会说，只要能实干就对，好好提高自己，现在不负担责任，再几年还是不会干”。康乐仁有了信心，便勇敢的负起责来，到班上参加讨论会，并了解本排情况。该部并在三查运动中，积极改造党的支部，大批雇贫农中农战士，光荣的参加了共产党，连队党的工作有了新气象，五支队五连这次发展了十五个党员，其他各连队亦不断的接受战士们的入党的要求。贫苦出身的战士郝富海、于福兴入党后，感到非常光荣，并坚决宣誓“不彻底打倒蒋介石，不消灭封建地主，永不回家”。连队支部增加了新的血液后，工作非常活跃，有的成立了读报组，加强时事教育，有的连队建立了新的工作制度，如班长排长在计划工作或处理问题时，先同本班本排的党员或党的小组长商量研究，密切工作。在发动连队群众讨论与审查新党员入党的条件过程中，不仅保证了党的组织纯洁，而且教育与提高了一般战士的政治觉悟与阶级觉悟。
