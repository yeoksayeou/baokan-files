[Taihang News] After several studies, the masses in Xigou Village, Pingshun, have eliminated misunderstandings about the Land Law and have organized to transport manure as early as possible. Wang Shize, a former lower-middle peasant, was worried about having his two oxen taken away and given to households without livestock after hearing about the "draw from the surplus to make up for the deficiency, draw from the fertile to compensate for the barren" method. Only after hearing that the property of middle peasants would not be touched did he feel relieved and become more motivated in production. On the second day of the first lunar month, the village held a meeting. Li Shunda said, "Spring is early this year, and there is a lot of work to be done. If we don't hurry up and take advantage of the slack season to transport manure, we will delay planting." After a period of discussion, everyone agreed that production should be pushed forward, not delayed, and that they should learn from last year's experience. They immediately divided into three groups, calculated the labor, livestock, and manure of the entire village, and decided to organize to complete the transportation completely before the 13th day, with an inspection on the 15th. After the meeting on the afternoon of the second day, everyone started working on the third day. Wang Shize, Lu Quanze, and others used coal cinder to pave the roads because the snow had melted and the roads were slippery. Li Daze carried manure to the shady slopes in the morning when the snow had not melted, and to the sunny areas in the afternoon. After five days of intensive work, Niu Yongqing's group transported 850 loads, with 400 loads remaining. Li Daze's group transported 900 loads, with 600 loads remaining. Song Maisuo's group transported more than half. Influenced by them, the entire administrative village began to help each other transport manure.

[Shahe News] Cui Yuxiu, a middle peasant in Quanhu Village, Second District, used to get up early every day to sweep a load of stubble fertilizer and collect fertilizer, with great enthusiasm for production. After hearing about the equal distribution of land, he mistakenly thought that middle peasants would be struggled against, so he stopped collecting fertilizer. Later, at a general meeting, he heard someone read the newspaper, which clearly stated that the property of middle peasants would not be touched and that poor and lower-middle peasants were one family. Only then did he understand the Land Law and regretfully said, "I haven't swept the stubble these past few days. After calculating, I have accumulated three mu less of fertilizer. If someone had read the newspaper to me earlier, I wouldn't have suffered this loss." (Liu Hengde)

　　西沟中贫农了解土地法
  　准备春耕互助送粪
    【太行消息】平顺西沟村群众对土地法因经过好几次学习，都消除了误解，已组织起来趁早送粪。以前下中农王狮则，听了抽多补少，抽肥补瘦的办法后，就想到自己有两个牛，怕将来抽去补给没牲口户；自听了中农浮财不动，才放了心，生产也有了劲。正月初二，村里开了个会，李顺达说：“今年春浅，工作又多，要不赶快趁空送粪，就要误种地。”大家讨论了一阵，都认为：生产要往前赶，不要往后拖，接受去年的经验。当场就分成三个组，把全村劳畜力和粪计算了一下，要组织起来在十三以前完全送完，到十五检查。初二下午开完会，初三就都干起来了。王狮则、路全则等，因消雪路稀，专用煤渣垫了路。李达则是早上雪不消，往背坡担，上午向阳地担。经过五天突击，牛永清组送了八百五十担，还有四百担没送。李达则组送了九百担，还有六百担没送。宋买锁组送了一半多。在他村的影响下，整个行政村，都开始互助送粪。
    【沙河消息】二区全呼村中农崔玉秀，以前每天早起扫一担的圪当的沤肥，还拾肥，生产劲头很大，一听说平分土地，误认为要斗争中农，就不拾粪了。后来开了个全体会，他听了人家念了念报，报上清清楚楚的说不动中农的浮财，中贫农是一家人，这才对土地法了解了，他后悔的说：“我这几天没扫圪当的，算了算帐，少积三亩肥，早先给我念一念报来，我就不吃这亏。”　　（刘恒的）
