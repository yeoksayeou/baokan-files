    Correspondence

    No. 10
    To the responsible comrade(s) of the People's Daily:

    Since the New Year, the newspapers I have read have made me feel very happy and pleased inside. Who am I happy for? For a segment of the honest, basic masses who, because they cannot speak well or dare to speak at all, coupled with those who do land reform work poorly and do not know for whom they are doing land reform, also do not know for whom they are doing mass movements, so they are thrown aside, forgotten, and remain oppressed. What pleases me is that they now have hope of not going hungry, not freezing, and not being oppressed. They have hope of learning to speak. This makes me want to be a crutch for them, to be a correspondent for the newspaper in this great land reform movement. This is my full-hearted passion, is it possible? I request a reply from the newspaper. Furthermore, I have seen materials from various areas in the border region in the newspaper, but I have not seen any materials, "good" or "bad," from my county, district, or village regarding land reform. Perhaps this is due to a lack of correspondents? Today, I am asking to fill this correspondent vacancy…

    My own class background is poor peasant, I attended school for four years, and after the Incident, I farmed for over a year. In 1939, I joined the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force and served for a total of seven years. In 1946, I was discharged due to illness and returned home, where I have been farming for over a year. Finally, I want to state that I am responding to the requests of the basic suffering masses.

              Jinan First Special District, Yuanchao County, Second District, Jindong Village
              Zheng Zhongzhi, February 5th

    Newspaper Reply: We welcome Comrade Zheng Zhongzhi's willingness to be a peasant correspondent. Our reporting of local areas is still too limited, and we hope everyone will become a correspondent.

    通讯往来
    第十号
    人民日报社负责同志：
    我自新年以来，看到的报纸，使我精神上很痛快，内心里也很喜欢。我为谁喜欢？为的一部分老实基本群众，由于他们的不会说话，也是不敢说话，加上那些不会作土改工作的人，也不知道为谁土改，还不知道为谁要群运，故而将他们扔到一边忘掉他们，仍是受压迫。我所喜欢的就是他们今后有不挨饿、不受冻、不受压迫的希望了。有学会说话的希望了。这样引起我想当他们一个拐杖，在这土地大改革的运动中，给报纸当一个通讯员。这是我满腔热火，是否可以呢？要求报社答复。再我看到报纸上材料，边区各地都见到些，惟我县区村对土改以来的“好”“坏”材料，一点也没看到过。大概许是缺少通讯员的缘故吧？今天我要求要补这个通讯员的缺………………。
    我自己的成份是贫农，出身上学四年，事变后务农一年余，于二十八年即参加抗日游击队，前后共七年，于三十五年因病复员在家，种地一年多了。最后说明我是受到基本苦群众的要求。
              冀南一专区元朝县二区金东村
              郑重之  二月五日
    报社答复：郑重之同志愿意做一个农民通讯员，我们很欢迎，我们报导的地方还太少，希望大家都来当通讯员。
