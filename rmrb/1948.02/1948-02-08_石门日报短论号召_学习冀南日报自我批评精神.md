    Shijiazhuang Daily Short Commentary Calls for Learning the Spirit of Self-Criticism from the Ji'nan Daily
    [This newspaper's report] After the Ji'nan Daily's self-criticism regarding the cheap purchase of a printing press in Shijiazhuang was published in this newspaper, the Shijiazhuang Daily not only published the main content but also published a short commentary stating: "The comrades of the Ji'nan Daily made a mistake in cheaply buying a letterpress machine at Zhongxing Stationery Store in this city. Returning the machine to its original owner is not enough; now they have also made a profound self-criticism. This spirit of self-criticism is very worthy of our learning. This incident proves that the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce is not only a real policy but also a unified policy of the entire Party. Chairman Mao made profound instructions on this policy in his report 'The Present Situation and Our Tasks.' We must act according to these instructions. Whoever violates these instructions is making a mistake and must correct it. Criticism and self-criticism are the most effective methods for correcting mistakes, especially when the people in newly liberated cities do not understand, or do not fully understand, the policies of our Communist Party, and are afraid to openly criticize our mistakes. We should even more learn from the example of the comrades of the Ji'nan Daily, dare to openly criticize ourselves." The short commentary continued: "When we published the news about Zhongxing Stationery Store, the main purpose was not to criticize the comrades of the Ji'nan Daily, but the Propaganda Department of the Jin-Hebei-Luyu Central Bureau, based on this news, issued a notice asking the Ji'nan Daily and propaganda organs at all levels to conduct investigations. After the investigation, the comrades of the Ji'nan Daily conducted self-criticism. We are willing to learn from this style, contribute more space to everyone, and hope that everyone will use it to pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses at all times, be brave in criticizing others, and be brave in criticizing ourselves, strengthen the combat effectiveness of our newspaper, strengthen our connection with the people of the city, and promote the work of the city."

    石门日报短论号召
    学习冀南日报自我批评精神
    【本报消息】冀南日报社在石门贱买印刷机的检讨在本报发表后，石门日报除将主要内容加以刊载外，并发表短论称：“冀南日报的同志，在本市中兴文具店贱买了一部铅印机，这件事情做错了，机器退回原主还不算，现在又作了深刻的自我批评。这种自我批评精神很值得我们学习。这件事情，证明中国共产党保护工商业的政策，不但是真实的政策，而且是全党统一的政策。毛主席在‘目前形势和我们的任务’的报告里，对这个政策作了深刻的指示，我们一定要照这个指示办事，谁违背这个指示，就是犯了错误，就必须改正。批评和自我批评是改正错误的最有效的方法，特别是新解放城市的人民，对我们共产党的政策还不了解，或不完全了解，还不敢公开地批评我们的错误的时候，我们更应当学习冀南日报同志们的榜样，敢于公开地批评自己。”短论继称：“我们发表中兴文具店的消息的时候，主要的还不在批评冀南日报社的同志，但晋冀鲁豫中央局宣传部根据这条消息，就发出通告，要冀南日报和各级宣传机关进行检查，冀南日报的同志们在检查之后，进行了自我批评。我们愿意向这种作风学习，贡献更多的篇幅给大家，希望大家利用它，时刻注意倾听群众的意见，勇于批评别人，并勇于批评自己，加强我们报纸的战斗性，密切我们与全市人民的联系，推进全市的工作。”
