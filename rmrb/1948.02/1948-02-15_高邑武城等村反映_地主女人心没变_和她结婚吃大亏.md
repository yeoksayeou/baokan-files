    Gaoyi, Wucheng and other villages reflect:
    Landlord women's hearts haven't changed;
    Marrying them is a big loss
    [Gaoyi News] Gao Ru Jin of Wucheng Village, Fourth District of this county, was tricked into marrying a landlord's woman. Gao Ru Jin is over sixty years old this year. He worked as a hired laborer for forty years and only has two dilapidated houses. After Gaoyi was liberated after the Japanese surrender, he was no longer a hired laborer. After he turned over a new leaf, someone introduced him to a wife who was a target of struggle. The woman is already in her thirties. Since they got married last year, she hasn't slept with Ru Jin once. She doesn't call Ru Jin "Dad" with her two children, nor does she speak to him. This year, they harvested twenty bags of wheat, and autumn looks promising too, but now his wife has taken everything, and he is extremely worried. Kong Fenglin is forty years old this year and has eight acres of bad land. He has been herding sheep since he was a child. He married the wife of a target of struggle, and she ate up all the wages he earned, leaving him in poverty and hardship. Since last year, his wife hasn't made him any socks, shoes, or clothes. She doesn't make him anything. In Xizhang Village, First District, there is a poor hired laborer named Zhang Xinfu. In the past, his family of three had nine fen of land. After the mass movement, he found a landlord's daughter as a partner. They lived well after they got married, but this year she heard that landlords would also get a share of land, and she immediately changed and stopped living properly. Zhang Xinfu is sick, and she doesn't care about him. She doesn't ask him whether he eats or not. (Jiu Lai, Xizhang Village Correspondence Group)
    [Wu'an News] Ma Bingxing, the militia captain of Xiaositang Village in Wu'an, married a landlord's woman, and as a result, she bit him, taking away twenty pieces of fruit and his own clothes that had been distributed to him. The traitorous landlord Yan Haiju of Xiaositang relied on the Japanese and killed three basic masses, embezzling a lot of money from the people. After Wu'an was liberated, the masses detained him and struggled against him. During the night, they didn't pay attention, and Yan Haiju ran away, leaving his woman and three children at home. The village militia captain, Ma Bingxing, came from a hired labor background. On April 9th last year, he married this woman. Last September, Ma Bingxing led the militia to participate in the war in northern Henan. On October 17th, Yan Haiju ran back and abducted the woman, and also took away the clothes Ma Bingxing had earned from eight years of long-term labor and the fruits and clothes distributed by the Farmers' Association, a total of twenty pieces.

    高邑武城等村反映
    地主女人心没变
    和她结婚吃大亏
    【高邑消息】本县四区武城村高如金与地主女人结婚上了当。高如金今年六十余岁了，他当了四十年雇工，家里就有两间破房子，别的什么也没有。日本投降，高邑解放以后，不当雇工了，翻身后即有人给他说了个老婆，是斗争对象。女人已有三十余岁，从去年结婚到现在，未和如金睡一回觉，带着两个小孩也不叫如金爹，也不说话。今年打麦子二十布袋，秋天又是好年景，现在叫老婆都弄光了，愁的不行。孔奉林今年四十岁了，家里有八亩坏地，从小放羊到现在。娶了斗争对象的老婆，把赚的工资给吃光了，受了穷，紧的不行。去年到现在老婆没有给他做过袜鞋衣服，什么也不给做。一区西张村有个贫雇叫张新福，过去家里三口人，九分地，群运后找了个地主闺女作为对象，才结婚过的倒也不错，今年她听说地主也同样分一份地，立刻改变了，不好好过了。张新福病了，她也不答理，吃饭不吃饭她也不问。（久来、西张村通讯组）
    【武安消息】武安小寺堂村民兵队长马秉兴，和地主女人结了婚，结果叫她咬了一口，把他分的果实和自己的衣服共二十件都拐走了。小寺堂汉奸地主阎海举，曾经依靠日本人，害死三个基本群众，贪污了老百姓很多钱。武安解放后，群众把他扣起，向他斗争。夜里没有注意，阎海举跑了，把女人和三个小孩丢在家里。村里的民兵队长马秉兴是雇工出身，在去年四月九日和这个女人结了婚。去年九月，马秉兴带民兵到豫北参战，十月十七日，阎海举跑回来，把这个女人拐走，还把马秉兴扛长活八年赚的衣裳和农会分的果实衣服共二十件，都拐走了。
