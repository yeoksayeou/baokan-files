Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st: A compilation of Middle Eastern dispatches: The people of various Arab countries in the Middle East have risen up to protest against the British imperialist scheme to organize a "Middle East Bloc" for aggression. Residents of Damascus, the capital of Syria, held a large protest demonstration on the 27th, shouting slogans such as "Sever relations with Britain." The demonstrators also submitted a memorandum to the Iraqi Minister, protesting against the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and all unequal treaties signed between Britain and Arab countries. The memorandum solemnly demanded "the true independence of Arab countries." Democratic人士 from Outer Jordan, who had fled to Damascus due to persecution by King Abdullah of Outer Jordan, also sent telegrams to Abdullah and Bevin, strongly protesting the conclusion of a new enslavement treaty between Britain and Outer Jordan. Arab newspapers have also fiercely criticized Bevin's arrogant statement after signing the so-called Anglo-Iraqi alliance treaty: "This treaty will be the beginning of a series of similar treaties concluded between Britain and Arab countries." The Lebanese Telegraph stated: "The Lebanese people have repeatedly stated that they are willing to maintain neutrality towards all countries and maintain friendly relations with them. We hope that our authorities will sacredly abide by neutrality for our independence." The Al-Boblack newspaper reminded the people to be vigilant against Bevin's conspiracy and questioned, "If one party to the treaty speaks on our behalf without consulting us, is it claiming to be our protector?"

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st: Baghdad dispatch: The anti-British movement of the Iraqi people is rising sharply. Masses in various places have broken through the suppression of the military police and bravely held demonstrations. After a mass demonstration of 100,000 people in Baghdad, Iraqi Regent Ira was forced to announce the resignation of former Prime Minister Jabr on the 27th and appoint former Senate Speaker Sadr to form a new cabinet. Jabr had just returned from Britain after signing the so-called "Anglo-Iraqi Alliance Treaty" with Bevin (which has now been declared abolished by the Iraqi side) and has now fled to Amman, the capital of Outer Jordan, to escape punishment.

During the Baghdad demonstration, the military police even used machine guns to fire on the demonstrators, resulting in hundreds of casualties, but the people still persisted in their struggle, bravely and unyieldingly. According to TASS Middle East News, the Iraqi people's resistance to the Anglo-Iraqi treaty has greatly frightened Britain, which has therefore delayed Bevin's original plan to separately conclude alliance treaties with Arab countries. The Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations have also been postponed indefinitely due to the recent large-scale protests by Egyptian students, but they are secretly carrying out other conspiracies to suppress this resistance. Recently, Britain secretly sent sixteen Nazis (eight of whom were former German officers) to Lebanon in an attempt to provoke bloody conflicts.

    抗议英帝侵略阴谋  中东各国人民示威
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合中东讯：中东各阿拉伯国家人民，群起抗议英帝国主义组织“中东集团”的侵略阴谋。叙利亚首都大马士革居民，二十七日举行抗议大示威，高呼“对英绝交”等口号。示威者并向伊拉克公使递交备忘录，抗议英伊条约及英国与阿拉伯各国签订之一切不平等条约。备忘录严正要求“阿拉伯国家之真正独立。”受外约但国王阿布杜拉迫害而逃亡至大马士革之外约但民主人士，亦纷电阿布杜拉与贝文，严重抗议英国与外约但间缔结新的奴役条约。阿拉伯各国报纸亦均猛烈抨击贝文在签订所谓英伊同盟条约后所称：“该约将为英国与阿拉伯诸国缔结一连串同类条约之开端”的狂妄声明。黎巴嫩电信报称：“黎巴嫩人民屡次声明，他们愿对一切国家保守中立，并与之保持友好关系，我们希望我们的当局为了我们的独立，能神圣地遵守中立”。阿耳布勃拉克报则提醒人民必须警惕贝文的阴谋，并质问“如果缔约一方不与我们商议，就擅自替我们说话，它是不是自命为我们的保护人呢？”
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】巴格达讯：伊拉克人民反英运动急剧高涨，各地群众连日冲破军警之弹压，英勇举行示威游行。伊摄政伊拉在巴格达十万人民大示威后，不得不于廿七日宣布前总理雅布尔之辞职，并任命前参议院院长萨德尔出组新阁。雅布尔甫自英国与贝文签订所谓“英伊同盟条约”（现已为伊方宣布废除）后奉召返国，现已畏罪化装潜逃外约但首府安曼。
    巴格达大示威时军警竟以机枪扫射游行群众，死伤达数百人，但人民仍坚持斗争，英勇不屈，现反英运动仍在延续扩展中。据塔斯社中东讯，伊拉克人民对英伊条约之反抗，使英国大为恐惧，已因此延缓贝文原定与阿拉伯各国分别订立同盟条约之计划，英埃订约谈判亦因最近埃及学生之抗议大示威而无期延搁，但暗中则努力进行其他压制此种反抗之阴谋。最近英国即曾密派十六名纳粹分子（其中八名为前德国军官）赴黎巴嫩，企图挑起流血冲突。
