    Destroying the Land Law Hurts Oneself
    Zuoquan and Zanhuang Punish Bad Village Cadres and Bad Elements
    [Taihang News] Zuoquan First District and Zanhuang Second District have recently detained and disciplined individual village cadres and bad elements who violated the Land Law. After the Land Law was announced, the chairman of the Hanwang Farmers' Association in Zuoquan stopped running his flour mill and slaughtered six pigs at once, some weighing only forty-odd catties, which caused great dissatisfaction among the villagers. At the conference of poor peasant and hired laborer cadres in the entire First District, it was discussed and decided to remove him from his post and expel him from the Farmers' Association. The district committee also expelled him from the Party based on the opinions of the masses. Zhang Baozi from Garden Village in Zanhuang, upon hearing the news of land redistribution, seized the opportunity to sell his property and undermine the Land Law. He found Zhang Jingni, the political director in the village, to act as a mediator (Jingni was not aware of the implications at the time), and sold more than one mu of his paddy field to Qin Wuni for 25,000 yuan, and also sold a cow from his family. Chen Gangxiao, the director of the Home Hermitage Military Committee, announced at a mass meeting that selling things was not allowed, but he sold four sheep the next day. After discussions at the village cadre meeting in the Second District, it was generally believed that such people who deliberately undermined the Land Law must be severely punished. The district government has detained them and is preparing to hand them over to the masses for processing.

    破坏土地法自己吃亏
    左权赞皇处分坏村干坏分子
    【太行消息】左权一区与赞皇二区，在最近对个别破坏土地法的村干部及坏分子，分别予以扣押和纪律的处分。左权寒王农会主席在土地法公布后，将开的粉坊停下，一下杀掉六口猪，有的才四十多斤重便杀了，村内农民非常不满。在一区全区贫雇干群会议上，大家讨论，给他撤销工作及开除农会会籍的处分。该区区委会也根据群众意见，将他开除党籍。赞皇花园村张包子，先听到平分土地的消息，便乘机变卖财产，破坏土地法。他找到村内政治主任张净妮当说合人（当时净妮还不明白），把自己一亩多水地，作价二万五千元，卖给了秦五妮，并将他家的一头牛也卖了。即家庵武委会主任陈岗小，在群众会上宣布不许卖东西，他第二天就卖了四个羊。以上几个人经二区村干会讨论，大家认为对这种故意破坏土地法的人，必须严重处分。区政府已把他们扣押起来，准备交群众处理。
