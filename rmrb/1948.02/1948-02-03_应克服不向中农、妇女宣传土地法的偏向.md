    The Tendency of Not Publicizing the Land Law to Middle Peasants and Women Should Be Overcome
    [Shexian News] The Shexian No. 1 District Shentou Joint School District held a meeting to summarize the experiences and methods of publicizing the Outline Land Law. Teacher Feng Huocheng from Jiangjia Village said: "When the Outline Land Law was published in the newspaper, I first read it to the poor peasants and farm laborers several times, but I didn't dare to read it to the middle peasants. I was afraid that if I read it to the middle peasants, they would feel uneasy, and production would definitely be affected." Teacher Shen Siming from Shentou said: "I think your publicity is a bias." He himself read it to the poor peasants and farm laborers, discussing it item by item, and also organized reading groups to study and understand it thoroughly, and then read it to the poor and middle peasants together in winter schools, so as to prevent landlords and rich peasants from deliberately distorting the Outline Land Law. Teacher Yao Qingquan from Yangjia Mountain said: "My publicity methods are similar to those of Shentou, but I haven't read it to women." Teacher Yao Hanying from Qiankuanzhang said: "I haven't read it to women either, I'm afraid they won't understand it clearly." Everyone said: This is also a bias. To overcome the above two biases, reading groups should be organized in every village, and the Outline Land Law must be known to men and women, young and old, in order to thoroughly implement equal distribution.

    应克服不向中农、妇女宣传土地法的偏向
    【涉县消息】涉县一区神头联合学区，开会总结宣传土地法大纲的经验与办法。江家庄教员冯火成说：“报上登出来土地法大纲，我首先向贫雇读了好几遍，可是没敢向中农读。我怕给中农读了，他心上一不安，生产非受影响不可。”神头教员申思明说：“我看你这样宣传是一个偏向。”他自己是给贫雇读了，一条一条的讨论，同时还组织读报小组，研究通达了，再到冬学给中贫农共同读，这样就能防止地主、富农故意曲解土地法大纲。杨家山教员姚青全说：“我的宣传方式方法和神头差不多，就是没给妇女读过。”前宽嶂教员姚汉英说：“我也没有向妇女读，我怕她们懂不清。”大家都说：这也是一种偏向。要克服以上两种偏向，要在村村组织读报组，真正要把土地法大纲叫男女老少都知道了，才能彻底的实行平分。
