    Shuzhang Farmers Extend New Year Greetings to Chairman Mao
    Write Letter to Chairman Mao Saying: We are Preparing for Spring Plowing and Implementing the Land Law
    [Taihang News] Farmers in Shuzhang, Sixth District of Huguan, held a "New Year Greetings to Chairman Mao Meeting" on the second day of the Lunar New Year. After collectively extending New Year greetings, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. The original letter stated: "Dear Chairman Mao: We are extending New Year greetings to you today. The road is far, and it's not easy to send heavy gifts. So, we will tell you about our production achievements and good life under your leadership, and consider it a gift to you! Last winter, the men in our village earned more than 1.4 million yuan in transportation, and also earned 1,750 jin of rice, and accumulated more than 90,000 dan of fertilizer; the women spun more than 1,900 jin of cotton, and wove more than 4,000 chi of cloth. The Lunar New Year's Day was much better than in the past in terms of food and clothing. On New Year's Eve, no one came to demand debts, and we were very comfortable. Today, we held a meeting to extend New Year greetings to you. Everyone discussed plans: before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the men should send all the fertilizer to the fields, and the women should spin two jin of cotton each. In addition to preparing for spring plowing and production, we must also have a good discussion on the Land Law and prepare to equally distribute the land. This time, we must be our own masters and follow your instructions to do a thorough job. Please rest assured. You must take good care of your health. You have worked so hard for the poor people to stand up and have turned over, we will never forget you. We hope you are healthy and come up with more ways for us to have a good life.
          Sincerely,
          All the farmers of Shuzhang

    [Huguan News] Shuzhang arranged the work for this first lunar month last December. The men must send all the manure to the fields before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. After the first day, on the second day, even before it was light, middle peasant Zhao Xiqun and Zhao Gouhai and others drove ox carts to deliver manure to the fields. They were very energetic in delivering manure. Starting early on the second day, they delivered two carts. After lunch, after the meeting it was almost dark, they made time to deliver four more carts. On the third day, even more manure was being delivered; before dawn, carts were rumbling all over the street.

    树掌农民给毛主席拜年
    给毛主席写信说：我们正在准备春耕，执行土地法
    【太行消息】壶关六区树掌农民，正月初二召开“给毛主席拜年大会”。大家集体举行拜年仪式后，又给毛主席写了一封信。原信说：“亲爱的毛主席：俺们今天给你拜年，路很远，重礼物也不好送。俺们就把在你领导下，搞的生产成绩和过的好光景告诉你，算给你送的礼吧！俺村去年冬天，男人运输赚洋一百四十多万元，又赚米一千七百五十斤，还积下九万多担肥；妇女纺花一千九百多斤，织布四千多尺。初一过大年那天，可比过去吃穿强啦，大年三十日，再也没人来要帐，过的很舒展。今天开会给你拜年，大家讨论计划，正月十五以前男人要把肥都送到地里，妇女每人要纺二斤花。除作春耕大生产准备外，还要好好讨论土地法，准备平分土地。这次俺们可要自己当家，一定照着你话来办，搞个彻底。望你放心。你要好好的保养身体，你为了穷人们翻身，可真费心不小，俺们啥时也忘不了你。俺们望你身体强壮，为俺们翻透身过好天气多想办法。
          树掌全体农民具
    【壶关消息】树掌在去年腊月就把今年正月的工作按排了。男人在正月十五以前，要把所有的粪送在地里。过了初一，初二天还不明，中农赵喜群与赵狗孩等就赶着牛车，往地里送粪。他们送粪非常有劲，初二起早送了两车，吃罢午饭，开了大会就快黑了，又抽空送了四车。初三送粪的就更多了，天不明车就轰遍了全街。
