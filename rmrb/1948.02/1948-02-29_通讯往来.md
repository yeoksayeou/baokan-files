To Comrades of the Central Bureau's Work Teams in Various Regions and the Military and Political University Work Teams:

　　We have received typical survey materials from various types of villages in the Ninth District of Wu'an, as well as experiences in interviewing poor peasants and hired laborers and rectifying the Party. This planned method of organizing reports is very good. It is hoped that, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's "Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification in Old and Semi-Old Areas" and the instructions of the Central Bureau, you will continue to report on the progress of mobilizing poor peasants and hired laborers, rectifying the ranks, launching democratic movements, and implementing land redistribution. We also hope that comrades of each work team will organize reports based on the characteristics of your work areas and the degree of work progress. We hope you will quickly write to us about the experiences, both successful and unsuccessful, in mobilizing poor peasants and hired laborers and rectifying the ranks, as well as work reviews and personal ideological reflections.

　　To the Propaganda Departments of the Sixth and Second Prefectural Committees of Taihang:

　　We have received all the registration forms for correspondents you sent. We hope that the correspondents who have joined the work teams will contact us quickly through letters during their work. Pay attention to reporting on the problems and experiences of different types of villages. We also hope you will continuously write to us about your experiences in work style and ideological transformation.
