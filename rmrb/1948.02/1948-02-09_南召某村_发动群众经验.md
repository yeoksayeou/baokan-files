A certain administrative village in Nanzhao County, with the peasant association's poor peasant group as the leading core, firmly united the middle peasants during the land reform. The village has 168 middle peasant households, accounting for about 34 percent of the total number of households in the village. At the beginning of the movement, most of the middle peasants were hesitant and waiting to see what would happen. However, when the hired and poor peasants launched a struggle to pour out their grievances and put forward the slogan "Hired and poor peasants are one family," some middle peasants knocked on the doors of hired and poor peasants at night, asking to join the peasant association. As the movement developed in depth, and preparations were being made to distribute land, the middle peasants generally shifted from watching to actively participating in the struggle, also demanding land distribution, but some well-to-do middle peasants still had some doubts in their minds. The peasant association immediately led the propaganda of the Land Law Outline, focusing on discussing whose land to distribute, the distribution methods, and how to handle debt relationships, and rectified the peasant association, clarified the class lines, dug out the roots of poverty, recognized their own people, and purged the rich peasants Zhang Fuyuan and Tian Guangde, who had infiltrated the peasant association. In the process of class demarcation, the population, land, and property were registered, so that the feudal exploiters and hired/poor and middle peasants were clearly distinguished, and the mood of the middle peasants became more stable and closer to the hired/poor peasants, and the peasant association also absorbed a large number of middle peasants into the association. Some middle peasants who were heavily burdened with debt were very active in settling old accounts and digging up the roots of poverty with the landlords. For example, Zhang某 expressed his firm determination to unite with the poor and overthrow usury at the struggle meeting to settle accounts with Zhang Fuyuan's high-interest exploitation, and requested to join the peasant association. The peasant association immediately announced its approval, and subsequently, more than a dozen middle peasants requested to join the peasant association. In addition, some middle peasants who had served as chiefs, tutors, and squad leaders for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had engaged in acts of oppression against the hired/poor peasants. The peasant association specially held a "face-washing meeting" to allow them to admit their mistakes and apologize to the poor. Li某, Ma某 and others performed well in the village after the face-washing, and the peasant association decided to observe them for a period of time before considering their requests to join the association.

    发动群众经验
    【新华社豫陕鄂一日电】南召县某行政村农会以贫农小组为领导核心，在土地改革中坚决团结了中农。该村共有中农一六八户，约占全村户数百分之三十四。在运动开初，中农大多观望不前。但当雇贫农展开诉苦斗争，并提出“雇贫中农一家人”的口号，就有些中农黑夜叫雇贫农的门，要求参加农会。当运动深入发展，准备分地时，中农便较普遍的由观望转变到积极参加斗争，也要求分土地，但个别富裕中农心里还有些疑虑。农会即时领导宣传土地法大纲，着重讨论分谁的地，分配办法和如何处理债务关系，并整顿农会，划清阶级，挖穷根，认清自家人，把混进农会的富农张富元和田广德等清洗出去。在划阶级过程中，登记了人口、土地和财产，使封建剥削者和雇贫中农划清了界线，中农情绪就更加稳定，更加靠拢雇贫，农会也大量吸收中农入会。一部分在债务上背利太大的中农，在和地主算老帐挖穷根时，表现很积极。例如张某在清算张富元的高利盘剥斗争会上表示坚决和穷人一心打倒高利贷，并要求加入农会。农会当场宣布批准，随后又有十多个中农请求参加农会。另外有些中农曾当过蒋匪的甲长夫子班长等，曾有欺压雇贫的行为，农会特地召开“洗脸会”让他们向穷人认错道歉。李某、马某等经洗脸后，在村里表现很好，农会决定再考察一个时期考虑他们的入会的请求。
