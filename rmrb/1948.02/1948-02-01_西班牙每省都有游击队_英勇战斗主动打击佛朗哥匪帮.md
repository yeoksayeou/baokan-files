Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Reports from various sources: The Spanish people's armed forces resisting the Franco gang have grown stronger in heroic battles, now developing to the point where "there is no province in Spain without guerrilla forces." According to a press release issued by the Spanish Communist Party on the 27th, in recent months, the guerrilla forces have strengthened their activities, especially in the Levant region, and have victoriously attacked the Franco gang's "punitive army." The effective operations of the guerrilla forces have made the bandit troops in Cordoba Province and Teruel Province tremble with fear, resulting in large-scale desertions. Meanwhile, according to a correspondent for the "Spanish News Letter" in Valencia, published in London, guerrilla forces and Franco's bandit troops recently engaged in day-long battles in the province. In addition, guerrilla forces are actively fighting the bandit troops in provinces such as Extremadura, Galicia, and Catalonia. In the Madrid area, resistance members have engaged in street fighting with the police. Furthermore, according to the "Today Spain" monthly magazine published by the "International Brigade Members Association" in London, Spain now has "well-organized and well-equipped guerrilla forces in every province." The magazine went on to publish the number of guerrilla operations, counting 350 operations in 1945, 446 operations in 1946, and 98 operations in the first two and a half months of last year. Calculated monthly, this averages 29 operations per month in 1945, increasing to 37 in 1946, and further increasing to 40 in 1947, reflecting the growing strength of the guerrilla forces. It also stated that in the above battle statistics, 75 percent were initiated by the guerrilla forces, and "the era when the guerrilla forces were always on the defensive is gone forever."

    西班牙每省都有游击队
    英勇战斗主动打击佛朗哥匪帮
    【新华社陕北三十日电】各方讯：西班牙人民反抗佛朗哥匪帮的武装力量，已在英勇战斗中壮大，现已发展至“西班牙没有一省无游击队”之态势。据西班牙共产党二十七日发表之新闻公报称：近数月来，游击队加强其活动，特别是在里凡特地区，已胜利地攻击了佛朗哥匪帮的“讨伐军”，游击队的有效作战，使科多瓦省与德鲁尔省的匪军胆战心寒，发生大批逃亡之现象。同时据伦敦“西班牙新闻信”驻瓦伦西亚记者报导：游击队与佛朗哥匪军最近在该省发生竟日战斗。此外游击队并在爱斯特里马杜斯省、加里西亚省与加泰隆尼亚等省积极与匪军作战。在马德里区域，抵抗运动会员曾与警察发生巷战。另据伦敦“国际纵队队员协会”出版之“今日西班牙”月刊载称：西班牙现在“每省都有了组织完善与装备优良的游击军部队”。该刊继发表游击队的作战次数，计四五年作战三五○次，四六年作战四四六次，去年头两个半月作战九十八次。若按月计算，则四五年平均每月作战二十九次，四六年增至三十七次，四七年又增至四十次，反映游击队力量之日趋强大。并称：在上述战斗统计中，百分之七十五均为游击队之主动出击，“游击队永远处于防御的时代，已一去不复返了”。
