Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 16th: London dispatch: The Communist Party of Great Britain continues to win in the trade union re-election struggles. Earlier this month, two Communist trade union leaders, Johns and Papworth, were re-elected to the executive committee of the Transport and General Workers' Union (with 1.25 million members) with an overwhelming majority. On the 8th, two Communists were elected as representatives of the Welsh Rhondda miners to the executive committee of the National Union of Mineworkers. Recently, at the annual meeting of the Dundee Trades Council in Scotland, Communist Party member Barkley was elected vice-chairman of the council, the first Communist to be elected to a formal position in the council. Bowtell, a Communist Party member and member of the Electrical Trades Union, was recently elected chairman of the Harlow Trades Council, and three other party members were elected to the council's executive committee. In the election of the Nottingham Trades Council, Communist Party members won two seats. After this news was released, the Nottingham branch of the United Society of Carpenters and Joiners sent a resolution to the council, stating: They firmly believe that the Communist representatives will safeguard the interests of trade union members and the entire working class. At the recent annual meeting of the London Trades Council (with over 500,000 members), Communist Party member Jock Nicholson was re-elected as secretary of the council's executive committee on the recommendation of 33 organizations. In addition, Barridge and several other Communist Party members were elected as executive committee members.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 16th: London dispatch: The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (membership 2.75 million, previously misreported as 2.5 million), one of Britain's largest trade unions, comprising 37 unions, passed a resolution on the 11th opposing Attlee's proposal to freeze wage levels, and declared that it would strive for wage increases. The union's general secretary, Martin, stated: Although the prices of food and other commodities have greatly increased over the past two years, there have been no increases in the wages of the union's members.

On the other hand, under the strong opposition of various trade unions, "rebels" have emerged among Labour Party members of Parliament. According to a United Press report on the 12th: Twenty-one Labour MPs signed a motion demanding the rejection of Attlee's policy of fixing wages. The report predicts that when the motion is introduced in the parliamentary debate, it will receive "support from more members."

    【新华社陕北十六日电】伦敦讯：英共继续在工会改选斗争中获胜。本月初，两名共产党职工领袖约翰斯与巴普沃兹，以绝大多数选票，连任英国运输及各业工会（会员一百二十五万人）的执委。八日，两名共产党员被选为威尔士龙达斯矿工参加全国矿工联盟执委会的代表。日前在苏格兰丹梯职工委员会年会上，英共党员巴克莱当选为该会副主席，这是被该会选任正式职位的第一名共产党人。电气职工会会员，英共党员鲍特尔，最近被选为哈洛职工委员会主席，另有三位党员被选入该会执委会。诺定罕职工委员会选举中，英共党员赢得两名席位，此一消息传出后，木匠联合会诺定罕分会以决议致该委员会，表示：他们坚信共产党代表将维护职工会会员与整个工人阶级的利益。在伦敦职工会委员会（会员五十余万）日前年会上，由于三十三个组织的建议，英共党员贾考斯连任该会执委会的书记。此外巴利治等数名英共党员被选为执委。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】伦敦讯：英国最大职工会之一，包括三十七个工会的造船与机械工会联合会（会员二百七十五万，前误为二百五十万），十一日通过决议，反对艾德礼冻结工资水平的建议，而声言将力争增加工资。该会总书记马丁称：两年来，虽然粮食与其他物价大大高涨了，可是本会会员的工资却无任何增加。
    另方面，在各工会强力反对影响下，下院工党议员中又出现了“反叛派”。据合众社十二日电：二十一名工党议员签署动议，要求否决艾德礼固定工资的政策。该电预计该项动议在下院辩论中提出时，将获得“更多议员支持。”
