Transmitted by the Cooperation Department, Comrade Lei Yun of the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee inquired about livestock diseases. We gathered Chinese and Western veterinary doctors for detailed discussions and decided on some suggestions. Similar diseases have also occurred in other places, and these suggestions can be used for reference in prevention and treatment.

Comrade Lei Yun's letter did not provide enough detail about the symptoms, so we could only discuss the situation based on what he mentioned with Chinese and Western veterinary doctors. According to the Chinese medicine diagnosis, it is jaundice, belonging to one of the malignant jaundice types, visceral jaundice. Western medicine diagnoses it as anthrax. They are described separately below:

A. Chinese medicine's perspective on the cause, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of jaundice:

It is said that there are many types of jaundice, a total of thirty-six, including twelve malignant jaundice types (divided into external jaundice and internal jaundice). Visceral jaundice, also called internal jaundice, is one of the most severe types of jaundice because it occurs in the internal organs and has no obvious external signs. It is not easily detected by ordinary people in time. By the time it is detected, it is already impossible to treat. If it can be detected early, there are still some ways to treat it, but if it is too late, it will only lead to death because the internal organs are already damaged, so there is no way to save it. Visceral jaundice is further divided into six types: heart jaundice, liver jaundice, lung jaundice, kidney jaundice, spleen jaundice, and slow intestinal jaundice, described as follows:

I. Cause: Due to dry weather, untimely or insufficient drinking water, and excessive feeding, the feed toxins accumulate in the triple energizer, excessive accumulation of heat, transmitted to the five internal organs, resulting in malignant jaundice.

II. Symptoms:
(1) Heart Jaundice: Bites itself or bites people, tongue color is as red as cinnabar, pulse is rapid and strong.
(2) Liver Jaundice: Mouth and tongue turn cyanotic, head droops, ears droop, eyes are closed and dull.
(3) Lung Jaundice: Mouth color is as white as dry bone, rapid and coarse breathing (noisy breathing).
(4) Kidney Jaundice: Mouth color is as black as ink, lower back and hips are painful, urination is dripping.
(5) Spleen Jaundice: Mouth color is like yellow soil, spleen fire is too strong, persistent diarrhea.
(6) Slow Intestinal Jaundice: Mouth and tongue are white and dull, lack of energy, ears droop, head droops, nasal discharge is yellow pus, smells like fecal slurry.

III. Treatment: Use 2 taels of Sichuan Zhongji, ½ tael of alum, grind into fine powder, then use boar bile (one) mixed with well flower water (freshly drawn cold water) to drench.

IV. Prevention:
(1) Bloodletting in spring and autumn can prevent the occurrence of various jaundice types.
(2) Do not feed leftover grass or feed, provide water on time, do not feed too much, and rest on time, which can also prevent it.

B. Western medicine calls this disease Anthrax, which is a hot, acute infectious disease.

I. Cause: Due to infection with Bacillus anthracis. This bacteria can produce spores and has strong resistance. It must be dry heated to 130 degrees Celsius for three to five minutes to kill it. It is transmitted into the animal's body through food, breathing, and skin cracks, or through a blood-sucking insect vector.

II. Symptoms: The incubation period is about one to ten days. It is most likely to stay and multiply in the blood vessels of the throat, causing serous edema mixed with gelatinous substances. The lymph nodes are also red and swollen, and the spleen is enlarged several times. The blood does not clot and is black. The bacteria multiply in the blood vessels, often blocking the blood vessels, obstructing the circulatory system, and preventing blood from flowing. The bacteria undergo changes in the intestines, causing the intestinal lymph nodes to also turn red and develop serous edema. The body temperature is above 40 degrees Celsius, breathing is rapid and forced, and blood is often discharged in the urine and feces. The muscles of the whole body are stiff, and at first there is severe abdominal pain.

III. Course:
(1) Most Acute: Dies within a few hours of onset.
(2) Acute: Dies within two or three days of onset.
(3) Chronic: Stands unwilling to move, dull, pupils dilated, pulse weak, breathing increased and difficult, mucous membranes appear blue-red, with bleeding spots, bowel movements initially constipated and then diarrhea, body is edematous, dies in seven or eight days, sometimes there are recoveries.

IV. Prognosis: Does not eat.

V. Autopsy: Non-clotting blood flows out of natural orifices. Blood does not clot after death. There are bleeding spots under the skin when peeling the skin. The spleen is enlarged several times, also with bleeding spots, and is weak or rotten. Blood examination during the onset of the disease shows Bacillus anthracis (under a microscope), which can be transmitted to humans.

VI. Treatment: This disease is difficult to treat. After discovery, strictly isolate it from healthy livestock. Inject anthrax serum (intravenously or subcutaneously), or intravenously inject 606. For horses and cattle, 2.7 grams each time, and small horses and cattle are reduced according to age. Orally administer 10 cc of Lysol, mixed with water, to disinfect the intestines and stomach. Use a 5% aqueous solution of carbolic acid, 50 cc, for daily internal use. For those with poor spirits, give cardiotonic stimulants.

VII. Disposal and Prevention: Anthrax is the most severe infectious disease. Once infected, it mostly leads to death. Therefore, the carcasses of animals that die from anthrax must be burned. The equipment used for sick animals should be disinfected and cleaned with lime water. The stable should be fully disinfected, and carcasses should not be eaten. Remove one foot of soil from the floor of the stable and burn it with grass to completely eliminate the bacteria and avoid future troubles. After anthrax-infected livestock is discovered, neighboring animals should be injected with anthrax serum for prevention. Sick animals must not be moved or sold arbitrarily. The discovery of anthrax should be reported to the government or notified to neighboring areas for effective prevention.

    骡马脏黄病
    顷由合作厅转来冀南三地委会雷云同志问牲口病的信，我们集中了中西兽医详加讨论，决定了一些意见，别的地方也有同样的病发生，这些意见可作参考，设法预防治疗。
    雷云同志来信中，对于病状谈的不够详细，我们也只有按他所谈的情况，和中西兽医研讨了一下。按中医的判断是黄症，属于十二恶黄中脏黄的一种；西医判断为炭疽病。现分别写在后面：甲、中医对于黄症的病原病状治疗和预防：
    据说黄的种类很多，共有三十六种，内有十二恶黄（分外黄、内黄二类），脏黄也叫内黄，是黄症中最厉害的几种，因为发生在内脏，外表无显著象征，一般人不容易即时发觉；及至发觉的时候，已经无法救治了。倘若能即早察觉，还有一些医治的办法，迟了就只有任其死亡。因为内脏已经坏了，所以无法救治。脏黄又分心黄、肝黄、肺黄、肾黄、脾黄及慢肠黄六种，分述于后：
    一、病原  由于天气干燥，饮水失时或不足，而又喂料太多，料毒积于三焦，积热太甚，传于五脏，致成恶黄。
    二、病状  （一）心黄  自咬其身或咬人，舌色红如珠砂，脉数洪大。
    （二）肝黄  口舌发青，头低耳搭，眼闭无光。
    （三）肺黄  口色白如枯骨，气促喘粗（出气带声）。
    （四）肾黄  口色黑如台＠①，腰胯疼痛，小便淋漓。
    （五）脾黄  口色如黄土，脾火太盛，泄泻不止。
    （六）慢肠黄  口舌白色无光，精神短少，耳搭头低，鼻流黄脓，臭如粪浆。
    三、治  法  用川中吉二两，白矾半两，共为细末，另用公猪胆汁（一个）和井花水（新汲冷水）调灌。
    四、预防法  （一）在春秋两季放大血，可预防各种黄症发生。
      （二）勿喂剩草剩料，按时饮水，喂料不可太多，按时休息，亦可预防。乙、西医称此病为炭疽，是热性急性传染病。
    一、原因  由于炭疽杆菌之传染，该菌能生芽胞，抵抗力强大，摄氏一百三十度干热、须三分至五分钟方可杀死。由于饮食物呼吸及皮肤裂处，传染入动物体内，或由一种吮血虫之媒介传染之。
    二、症候  潜伏期约一日至十日，在喉部血管中最易停留而繁殖，发生浆液性水肿，夹有精胶状物质，淋巴腺亦发红肿，脾脏肿大数倍，血液不凝结而黑色，病菌在血管中生孳繁殖，常将血管闭塞，循环器受阻碍，血液不得流通，病菌在肠中发生变态，使肠淋巴腺亦发红而生浆液性水肿，体温在摄氏四十度以上，呼吸速迫，大小便常有血液排出，全身肌肉发硬，起初有发剧烈之腹痛者。
    三、经过（一）最急性  发病后数小时倒毙。（二）急性  发病后二三日倒毙。（三）慢性  站立不愿走动，沉闷，瞳孔散大，脉搏微弱，呼吸增加而困难，露出粘膜呈蓝红色，有出血斑点，大便初秘结而后泻，体态浮肿，七八日而倒毙，间有痊愈者。
    四、预候  不吃。
    五、尸体解剖  天然孔流出不凝固之血液，死后血液也不凝固，剥皮时皮下有出血斑点，脾脏肿大数倍，亦有出血斑点，且柔弱或腐烂，发病时检查血液内有炭疽杆菌（显微镜下），能传染给人。
    六、疗法  此病治疗困难，发现后与健畜严行隔离，注射炭疽血清（静脉或皮下），或静脉注射六○六，马牛每次二、七格兰姆，小马牛依年龄而递减，内服来苏儿十西西，混水与之，消毒肠胃，用石炭酸百分之五，水溶液五十西西，每日内服。精神不振者，给以强心兴奋药。
    七、处置及预防  炭疽为最剧烈之传染病，一经传染，多归死亡。故凡因炭疽而死亡之尸体，必须烧掉，病畜用具，以石灰水消毒、清洗。马房内应充分消毒，尸体不可食用。马房之地，去土一尺，用草烧之，以期完全烧除病菌，免遗后患。发现炭疽病畜后，其邻近之兽类，宜注射炭疽血清，以资预防。病畜不得任意移动买卖，发现炭疽，应呈报政府，或通知邻接地区，作有效之预防。
