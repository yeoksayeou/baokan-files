Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th -- Soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, braving wind, snow, and severe cold, have launched a mass "assault warfare" training upsurge. Based on the development and needs of the future war situation, they first conducted intensive training for cadres in various regiments, meticulously studied the experience of past assault battles, and improved the tactical thinking and combat actions of middle and lower-level commanders in assault warfare. Then, with the cadres taking the lead, they launched a widespread training movement. Under the educational method of "officers teaching soldiers" and "soldiers teaching officers," the creativity of the soldiers was greatly developed, and the commanding ability of the cadres was improved. For example, in a certain regiment's second battalion's exercise, after the assault company received the task of capturing a bunker complex, the company commander did not deeply understand how to capture it and reduce casualties, and then issued an order. After the soldiers studied it, they found that the order had many shortcomings and developed another method. After the company commander adopted this method, the battle was won completely. During a certain battalion's exercise, the enemy's situation was first drafted, and the squads and platoons studied it on the sand table. The soldiers put forward the commander's position, fire organization, attack actions, etc., which helped the commander to organize the battle more comprehensively.

In order to promote the training upsurge, more than two-thirds of the cadres of some regimental headquarters went deep into the companies. Military cadres solved tactical problems of the companies, political cadres organized mutual assistance, cultivated typical examples, and understood and consolidated the training mood; supply and health cadres respectively helped to improve the food and company hygiene. They lived with the soldiers in the squads, so they understood the situation very specifically, and solved the problems very practically, greatly promoting the training movement.

　　适应战争形势需要
  　华东某部练攻坚战
    【新华社华东二十日电】解放军某部健儿冒风雪严寒掀起群众性“攻坚战”练兵热潮。他们根据今后战争形势的发展和需要，首先在各团集训干部，缜密的研究了以往攻坚战斗的经验，提高中下级指挥员攻坚战术的思想和战斗动作，然后在干部带头下，展开了普遍的练兵运动。在“官教兵”、“兵教官”的教育方法下，大大发扬了战士的创造性，并提高了干部的指挥能力。如某团二营演习中，突击连接受攻下地堡群的任务后，对如何夺取和减少伤亡，连指挥员并未深刻理解，就下了命令，战士研究后，发现命令有许多缺点，并研究出另一个办法，连指挥员采用这个办法后，战斗即获得全胜。某营演习时，先拟就敌情，由班、排于沙盘研究，由战士提出指挥员的位置及火力组织、攻击动作等，帮助了指挥员更全面的组织战斗。
    为推动练兵热潮，某些团三分之二以上的团部干部都深入连队，军事干部解决连队战术问题，政工干部组织互助，培养典型，了解和巩固练兵情绪；供给、卫生干部分别帮助改善伙食和连队卫生工作。他们和班里战士一道生活，因此了解情况很具体，解决问题就很切实，大大推进了练兵运动。
