Twenty teachers and students from Yuxian Middle School have joined the Liberation Army, including three teachers and nine female students. They exposed the headmaster's corruption, saying, "The headmaster, like the Chiang bandit officers, eats empty salaries, reporting over 600 students when there are only 500 in the whole school, embezzling over 20 million yuan each month. The political department of a unit of the Liberation Army accepted their request, and some were assigned work according to their wishes, while the younger ones were sent to study at Yilu Middle School. One student wrote in his diary about meeting the Liberation Army: "The first day I saw the truth."
