　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—According to reports from Rangoon: An uprising has occurred in the Karen and other regions of Southern Burma, known as Burma’s granary. Mass revolutionary movements are gaining momentum in Papun (adjacent to Laos north of Siam), Bassein in the Arakan region, and Henzada. On the 11th, over seven thousand Karen people gathered in the Ying Shan area and held a demonstration. Similar demonstrations were held in various Karen-inhabited cities on the same day. It is reported that this movement is led by the Karen National Union, demanding the establishment of an independent sovereign state to unite the people of Arakan, Karen, and Tenasserim along the Malayan border in the southern Burmese delta. The current Burmese government has dispatched troops to the aforementioned areas, attempting to suppress them by force. The Karen people are the second largest of Burma's five major ethnic groups. According to pre-war census data, the population is approximately 1.5 million.

    卡伦民族争取独立
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据仰光讯：号称缅甸谷仓之南缅卡伦等区发生起义。卡伦区之巴本（按该地与暹罗北之老挝接壤）及阿拉干省之巴森、痕扎达诸城之群众革命运动正方兴未艾。十一日有七千余名卡伦族于英山区集会，并举行示威，卡伦族所住各城同日均举行相同之示威运动。据悉，此一运动系在卡伦民族联盟领导之下，要求成立一独立主权国家，以团结南缅三角洲之阿拉干、卡伦与沿马来亚边境之颠拿沙廉等地人民。缅甸现政府已派遣军队赶往上述各地，妄图实行武力弹压。按卡伦族在缅甸五大族中占第二位，据战前户口调查，人口约一百五十万名。
