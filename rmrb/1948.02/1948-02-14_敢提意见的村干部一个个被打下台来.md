    The cadres in power not only suppress the masses, but also try every means to strike down cadres and activists who speak frankly. Tan Qingzi, the chairwoman of the women's association, said to the cadres, "We cadres take more of the fruits than the masses." The cadres then said she was leading the masses to struggle against the cadres. She also expressed her opinion about Duan Bingnan's often putting on airs. Because she wasn't in cahoots with the cadres, they didn't call her to attend meetings. Only after the district cadres raised objections did this situation change. Once, when distributing the fruits, no share was allocated to her nephew. She was dissatisfied and compared herself to Zhang Xixiu, a member of the farmers' association, and Zhang Xixiu held a grudge, saying, "If Tan Qingzi doesn't step down, I won't be a cadre." Later, Zhang Xixiu said that Tan Qingzi was leading "loose women" in spinning. One day, Tan Qingzi and several women were playing cards (not gambling), and Zhang Xixiu reported it to other cadres, sent militiamen to arrest them for "gambling," and dismissed her from her position, also demanding the confiscation of all her property. She was so frightened that she cried all day and was sick for several months. Later, because the masses disagreed, they only confiscated one share of her fruit. Recently, Zhang Xixiu admitted during self-criticism that she had intentionally retaliated against Tan Qingzi. The production director, Lao Shangzi, was also dismissed because he liked to speak frankly. Poor peasant Duan Tingyu said, "When I was washing my face in the dark, District cadre Lao Hao asked me to give my opinion. After Lao Hao left, he didn't openly retaliate against me, but he (reduced) my share (of fruit points) by two points. I am still an activist, but they don't want me to do propaganda anymore, and they haven't called me to meetings since."

    敢提意见的村干部一个个被打下台来
    当权的干部不光压制着群众，对说直理的干部和积极分子，也想尽办法打击下去。妇会主席谭青子对干部们说：“咱干部们占的果实比群众多。”干部们就说她领导群众斗争干部。她看到段炳南常耍态度，也提出意见。因为她和干部们不一个鼻孔里出气，干部们开会就不叫她参加。区干部提了意见以后，才改变了这种情况。有一回分果实，没给她侄子定分。她不满意，和农会委员张西秀比了比，张西秀就记恨在心里，说：“谭青子不下台，我这干部不当啦。”后来，张西秀就说谭青子领导“破鞋”纺织。有一天，谭青子和几个妇女抹牌玩（不赌钱），张西秀就报告了别的干部，派民兵抓了“赌”，撤了她的职，还要没收她的全部财产。吓得她整天哭，病了几个月，后来因为群众不同意，只没收了她一分果实。最近张西秀在反省中，承认了有意的对谭青子报复。生产主任老尚子，也因为好说直理，被撤了职。贫农段廷玉说：“擦黑洗脸的时候，区干部老郝叫我提意见。老郝走了以后，没明面报复咱，给我（减）去了二分（果实分数）。我还是积极分子呢，没有宣传（布）不要我，反正开会再没叫过我。”
