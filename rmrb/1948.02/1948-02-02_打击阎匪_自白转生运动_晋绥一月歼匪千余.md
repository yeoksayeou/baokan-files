    Crushing Yan Bandit's "Self-Confession and Rebirth Movement"
    Over 1,000 Bandits Eliminated in Jin-Sui in One Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 31st] Local armed forces in various parts of Jin-Sui have been extremely active around the New Year. According to incomplete statistics from December 20th to the 20th of this month, in one month, a total of over 1,300 troops and local bandits of Fu Zuoyi and Yan Xishan were eliminated. Among them, the deputy battalion commander of Yan's 39th Division, Feng Ziyi, and more than 450 fleeing personnel including the section chief of the puppet Daning County government were killed or wounded. 870 troops including the battalion commander of the 2nd battalion of the 11th Supplementary Training Division of Fu's bandit army, Li Baozhen, were captured alive. More than 730 rifles, 43 light machine guns, 21 various artillery pieces, and many other military supplies were seized. The grain and livestock seized back were all returned to the affected masses. In northern Shanxi, Yan's bandits from Xin County harassed Guo County without success, and our local armed forces are now approaching Xin County again. On January 10th, a certain unit of local armed forces raided Yan's bandits who were harassing Xin County, wiping out more than 50 enemies. The local armed forces in central Shanxi crossed the Taiyuan-Fenyang highway and launched extensive attacks in the plains of Yangqu, Qingyuan, Taiyuan, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, Fenyang, and Dai, striking at Yan's bandit's "Self-Confession and Rebirth Movement" (actually a vicious plot by Yan's bandits and landlords to slaughter peasants and settle accounts, and disguised conscription), searching for Yan's bandit village political personnel, and rescuing the suffering people.
