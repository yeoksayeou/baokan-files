　　The prices of goods and stock prices in the United States have continued to fall this week, continuing a 19-day decline, which shows that "the American economy has entered a stage of decline, or is approaching a stage of decline" (TASS). On the 15th, the average index of 35 American commodities had fallen to about 186, a sharp drop of 21 percent from a month ago. By the 20th, "the wholesale prices of about 900 basic commodities showed the sharpest decline in a year and a half" (Associated Press). Even American economists have had to admit frankly that "prices will continue to fall"! The sharp drop in stocks and securities has made brokers of major American companies anxiously "pace the floor of the stock exchange." The price drops of nearly three weeks have begun to produce serious consequences. On the one hand, due to the disastrous drop in agricultural product prices, the vast number of farmers have increasingly fallen into a miserable state of bankruptcy; farmers in Kansas alone have lost one million U.S. dollars. On the other hand, bankruptcies of factories, enterprises, and stores are increasing. According to a TASS dispatch on the 19th, quoting the U.S. Commerce Daily, "The number of company bankruptcies last week reached the highest peak since January 19, 1943." This serious situation has made American capitalists "uneasy" and flustered. Truman's economic advisors are racking their brains to "draft a plan to deal with the economic crisis that will eventually come" (U.S. Wall Street Journal). The above facts prove that the storm of the American economic crisis is approaching.
　　Just before the arrival of this economic crisis storm, American imperialism is trying every possible means to make a dying struggle. On one hand, it is frantically clamoring to rescue the "Marshall Plan" and is more frantically implementing plans to aid Greece, Turkey, and Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, it is colluding with the British and French reactionaries to prepare for a unilateral convocation of the Three-Power Conference and the reopening of the Western European Sixteen-Nation Conference in order to further divide Germany and establish a "Western European Group." To cover up this conspiracy, the U.S. imperialists fabricated and published the so-called "Records of Nazi-Soviet Relations between 1939 and 1941," vainly attempting to launch a propaganda offensive to slander the Soviet Union and put a fig leaf on its naked policy of aggression. However, this kind of "fascist measure" by U.S. imperialism has aroused unanimous condemnation from the people at home and abroad. The Soviet Information Bureau immediately countered, publishing the important document "Historical Falsifiers," which powerfully hit the vital point of the American, British, and French reactionaries, so that the false anti-Soviet propaganda had to cease. At the same time, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia held a meeting of foreign ministers on the 17th to discuss the general situation in Germany, expressing their intolerance of the attempt by the U.S., Britain, and France to turn Germany into a new hotbed of aggression. The German people have also risen up to oppose the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to divide Germany. At the 7th plenary session of the Central Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party, the party's vice-chairman, Ulbricht, called on all democratic forces in the country to fight against the "Marshall Plan" that would colonize Germany. The twenty-year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed between the Soviet Union and Hungary on the 18th, and the signing of the trade agreement between the Soviet Union, Belgium and Luxembourg and the upcoming negotiations on the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, have also greatly strengthened the power to "prevent Germany and any other country united with Germany from re-engaging in aggression," and gave the Marshall Plan a powerful blow.
　　Despite the fact that American imperialism has intensified its suppression of the American people's democratic movement, and has successively and unreasonably arrested Williamson, one of the leaders of the American Communist Party, and Smith, the secretary of the Maritime Union of the CIO, the people's democratic movement has continued to develop rapidly under the attacks of the reactionaries this week. Isaacson, the progressive Labor Party candidate in the United States, won an overwhelming victory in the House of Representatives by-election in the Bronx district of New York State, which is dominated by the Democratic Party. This "means that the people have rejected the 'Marshall Plan,' anti-labor laws, and anti-communist and anti-people acts, and it also means that the people voted in trust of Wallace and the Third Party." The American people's movement against universal military training and protesting against anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic activities is continuing to unfold, which reflects how strong and irresistible the American people's desire for peace and opposition to aggression is.
　　Another important event of the past week was that the Italian People's Democratic Front won new victories in the struggle against the Gasperi reactionary camp. The results of the election in the city of Pescara on the 17th revealed that the People's Democratic Front had an overwhelming advantage, winning 21 seats in the city council, while the Christian Democratic Party, the Saragat Party, the Republican Party, and other right-wing parties won a total of 19 seats. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti pointed out in a congratulatory message that "This is a victory for the laws of the Republic over the reactionary and brutal rule of the Christian Democratic Party," and this victory symbolizes the bright future of the Italian people in the upcoming general election.

### 经济危机风暴快到了  美帝力图作垂死挣扎

　　经济危机风暴快到了  美帝力图作垂死挣扎
    美国的物价和股票价格，本周来仍继续下跌，这继续了十九天的跌风，说明“美国经济已进入衰落阶段，或正迫近衰落阶段”（塔斯社）。十五日，三十五种美国商品的平均指数，已下跌到一八六左右，较一个月前猛跌百分之二十一。到二十日，“九百种左右基本商品的批发价格，呈现了一年半以来最尖锐的下跌记录”（合众社）。甚至连美国的经济学家也不得不坦白地承认，“物价将继续下跌”！股票证券的暴跌，使美国各大公司的经纪人焦急地“在股票交易所的地板上，踱着步子”。将近三周来的跌价，已开始产生了严重的后果。一方面，由于农产品价格的惨跌，广大农民已日益沦于破产的惨境；仅堪萨斯一州的农民，即已损失了一百万美元。另一方面，工厂企业和商店的破产愈见增加，据塔斯社十九日电引证美商务日报说：“上周公司破产的数目，已达到一九四三年一月十九日以来的最高峰”。这种严重局势，使美国大资本家“惴惴不安”和手忙脚乱，杜鲁门的经济顾问正苦思“草拟一个计划，以应付终将到来的经济危机”（美华尔街日报）。上述事实证明了美国经济危机的暴风雨是快到了。
    就在这经济危机风暴来临的前夕，美帝国主义正千方百计力图作垂死的挣扎。它一面狂吠抢救“马歇尔计划”、并更疯狂地实行援助希、土、蒋的计划，同时又勾结英法反动派，准备片面召开三国会议，和重开西欧十六国会议，以便进一步分裂德国和建立“西欧集团”。为掩饰此种阴谋，美帝竟伪造发表所谓“一九三九年至四一年间纳粹与苏联关系录”，妄图发动一个诬蔑苏联的宣传攻势，为它的赤裸裸的侵略政策挂上一块遮羞布。但是，美帝国主义此种“法西斯措施”，更激起了国内外人民的一致声讨。苏联情报局当即予以反击，发表了“历史伪造者”的重要文件，有力地打中了美英法反动派的要害，以致虚妄的反苏宣传，终不得不偃旗息鼓。与此同时，波、南、捷于十七日召开三国外长会议，讨论了德国的总形势，对美英法变德国为新侵略温床的企图，表示不能容忍。德国人民亦奋起反对美帝分裂德国之阴谋，在德国统社党中央局第七届全会上，该党副主席吴布利希号召集中国内一切民主力量，为反对使德国殖民地化的“马歇尔计划”而斗争。苏联与匈牙利于十八日缔结的二十年友好互助条约，和苏、比、卢贸易协定的签字与即将开始的通商航海条约之谈判，也大大加强了“阻止德国及任何其他联合德国国家再事侵略”的力量，并给了马歇尔计划以有力的打击。
    尽管美帝国主义加紧镇压美国人民民主运动，又先后无理拘捕美共领袖之一的威廉逊和产联海员工会书记史密斯，但人民民主运动，一周来仍在反动派的进攻下迅速发展。美国进步的劳工党候选人伊萨克逊，在纽约州民主党占优势的波伦特区之众院补缺选举中，取得了压倒的胜利。这“意味着人民摈弃了“马歇尔计划”、反劳工法；和反共反人民的行为，同时也意味着人民投票信任华莱士和第三党”。美国人民反对普遍军训和抗议反苏反共反民主的运动正继续展开，这反映了美国人民热望和平和反对侵略的意志，是如何顽强而不可抗拒。
    过去一周另一重要事件，便是意大利人民民主阵线在与加斯贝利反动阵营的斗争中，获得了新的战果。贝斯加拉市选十七日揭晓结果，人民民主阵线占压倒优势，荣获市议会议席二十一席，基督教民主党、萨拉盖特党、共和党及其他右派共计占十九席。意共领袖托格里亚蒂于贺电中指出：“这是共和国法律对基督教民主党反动而残酷的统治的胜利”，而这一胜利，正象征着意国人民在未来大选中的光明前途。
