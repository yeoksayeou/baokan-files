    Taihang Fifth Special District Inspects Financial and Grain Work
    Discovers Significant Grain Loss in Warehouses
    Decides to Overcome Bureaucracy, Enforce Strict Regulations, and Reform Warehouse Cadres.
    [Our Dispatch] The Finance Department of the Taihang Fifth Special District convened a meeting of chief accountants from the financial and grain departments of various counties on the 4th of this month to review last year's work and, in accordance with the spirit of the new system, to study methods for improving work. During the inspection, many very serious problems were discovered that urgently needed immediate resolution:
    (1) Over the past year, the total grain loss in warehouses across the eleven counties of the entire special district amounted to ×××× shi of rice and wheat. Some of this was due to the grain being wet when collected as public grain, which then lost weight after drying. However, the main reason was poor warehouse management leading to losses. Many village warehouse cadres were landlords or rich peasant elements who abused their power to manage grain receipt and distribution, engaging in sabotage and falsely reporting weight loss. In Dashi Yan Village, Qi County, the warehouse director, Shen Guangyao, a landlord, was in charge of storing 150,000 jin of grain. After drying the grain, he falsely reported a loss of 11,000 jin to the county. After the leadership replaced him and conducted a stocktake, it was found that the actual loss was only 6,000 jin. In Zhao Zhuang Village, the village initially falsely reported a loss of 1,000 jin when settling accounts with the county, but then discovered an excess of 200 jin during grain distribution. In Bai Si Village, Ji County, 6,000 jin of corn was stored, and neither the county nor the district knew that 1,400 jin had been lost to insect damage over the summer. In Hui County, 39 out of 114 village warehouses are still managed by landlords. In the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Lin County, warehouses had not been inventoried for three years since their establishment. Last year, an inventory revealed that 23,000 pairs of military shoes, due to repeated transportation and careless handover procedures, could not be matched, were rejected by the troops, and could not be distributed. In Long Ao, Ji County, 68,400 jin of grain was stored, with losses reaching 2,522 jin.
    The investigation revealed that the causes of this situation were mainly leadership and bureaucratic practices in warehouse operations. There was a lack of inspection at the village level, and even when inspections were carried out, they were perfunctory. In some cases, the situation of grain stored in villages for a year was not understood. Sometimes, village and district cadres could get away with reporting weight loss simply by mentioning it when settling accounts with the county. Village and district cadres have not been genuinely reformed, and in many villages, financial power is controlled by landlords, rich peasants, and bad cadres, resulting in serious losses of public grain.
    2. The treasury cash management system also had many flaws. Every county had discrepancies in the inventory of grain coupons and cash. In many places, accounts did not match the treasury. When counties handed over funds to the special district, the special district did not count them. When disbursing funds, the special district simply sent out the same amount. The recipients also did not count the money in person, resulting in mutual discrepancies and making it impossible to assign responsibility. For example, Tangyin twice withdrew a total of 17 million yuan from the special district but the amounts were off by 184,000 yuan. When the special district received payments from Anyang, they were off by 23,000 yuan. Tangyin did not pay attention when collecting unified tax payments and accepted 142,000 yuan in counterfeit notes. Lin County also received 110,000 yuan in counterfeit notes. Tangyin only complained about inventory discrepancies but did not inspect the cashier, leading to the cashier, Chen Kejing, altering accounts and embezzling 280,000 yuan. The grain accountant in Hui County only managed his own accounts and did not help the cashier clear the inventory, and it was only recently discovered that there was a shortage of 700 jin of grain coupons in the inventory.
    3. Grain and fund borrowing were extremely chaotic in various counties. County Magistrate Ma of Anyang, without the approval of the leadership, arbitrarily borrowed 240,000 jin of border grain and used it for relief, which could not be resolved and became an unresolved case. Troops stationed in villages borrowed grain indiscriminately without government allocation, issuing informal IOUs. Zhangnan County lent grain to troops, issuing receipts with only personal seals and informal notes, resulting in over 130,000 jin of grain that could not be accounted for or claimed. In many villages, accounts were disconnected from the treasury, with figures in the accounts but no grain in the warehouse.
    After conducting a thorough review of last year's work, everyone studied new methods based on the spirit of the new system. In terms of warehouse grain storage, there was a special discussion on methods to reduce losses. It was decided to thoroughly reform warehouse cadres in conjunction with equitable distribution and overcome bureaucratic practices. At the beginning of the implementation of the new system, procedures must be unified, and the system must be strictly enforced to prevent corruption, arbitrary expenditures, and borrowing, ensuring that accounts match the treasury.

    太行五专署检查财粮工作
    发现仓库存粮脱损很多
    决定克服官僚主义，严格制度，改造仓库干部。
    【本报消息】太行五专署财政科，在本月四号召开各县财粮科审会计会议，检查去年的工作。并根据新制度的精神，研究了改进工作的办法。在检查工作时，发现了许多非常严重的问题，急需立时解决：
    （一）一年来全专区十一个县，仓库存粮共脱损米麦××××石。这里边有的是征公粮时粮食就湿，晒干后脱了秤。但主要是仓库保管不好而脱损的。不少村仓库干部是地主富农分子，掌管了收发粮食的权利，从中捣鬼，假报脱秤。淇县大石岩村，保存粮食十五万斤，仓库主任申广尧是地主，晒粮后到县谎报脱秤一万一千斤。领导上撤换了他，又进行清仓，发现只脱了六千斤。赵庄村在县算帐先假报脱秤一千斤，但发粮时又长出了二百斤。汲县白寺村存玉茭六千斤，县区都，不知道过夏天虫吃损失一千四百斤。辉县一百一十四个村仓库，三十九个村现在还是地主当干部。林县四、六区自建立仓库以来，三年没清过一回。去年清了一次，发现保存的军鞋因来回转运，交接手续不注意，弄的有二万三千双找不成对，部队不要，发不出去。汲县龙凹存粮六万八千四百斤，脱秤达二千五百二十二斤。
    检讨造成这种情形的原因，主要是领导上与仓库工作上的官僚主义。对村上缺乏检查，即便检查一下也是敷衍了事，有的粮食在村上埋伏一年还不了解。有时村区干部在县算帐时，说说就给报了脱秤。村区干部还没有得到真正的改造，许多村的财政大权为地主富农坏干部掌握，使公粮受了严重损失。
    二、金库出纳制度也有好多毛病，粮票和现款库存，没有一个县不发生差错。许多地方帐库不符。县向专署交款，专署不点数，发款时又照数发出，取款者也不当面点数，结果互相差错，无法追求责任。如汤阴两次从专署取款一千七百万元，就错了十八万四千元。专署收安阳款，发出时错了二万三千元。汤阴收统税款不注意，接了假票十四万二千元。林县也收了假票十一万元。汤阴光喊库存不对，对出纳不检查，致使出纳陈克敬涂改帐目，贪污二十八万元。辉县粮食会计光管自己结帐，就没帮助出纳清过库，直到最近才知道库存米票短七百斤。
    三、粮款借支，各县非常混乱。安阳马县长不经领导上的批准，擅自借边粮二十四万斤，做了救济粮，无法解决，成了悬案。部队在村不经政府支拨，乱开借条借粮。漳南县借给部队粮食，开的是手章和白条，弄得十三万多斤粮食无处算帐要粮。许多村庄是帐库脱节，帐上有数，仓库无粮。
    大家对去年的工作做了深刻检讨后，根据新制度的精神，研究了新的办法。在仓库存粮上，特别讨论了减少脱损的办法。决定结合平分，彻底改造仓库干部。克服官僚主义作风，在新制度实行的开始，手续上一定要统一起来，严格执行制度，杜绝贪污和乱支乱借等现象，做到帐库一致。
