My father started working as a long-term laborer for the landlord Jiang Yuanmei at the age of eighteen. When I was five years old, my mother died. My father discussed with Jiang Yuanmei about bringing me along. The landlord said, "It's okay, but you have to help with some food costs!" My father said, "Then I'll earn a little less." That year, he earned seventeen silver dollars less and left me there. When I turned eight, I looked after the landlord's children. At thirteen, I herded cattle. In the eleventh month of that year, the twenty-seventh day, it snowed heavily. I told the landlord that the snow was very heavy, that I should feed the cattle and go herding another day when it cleared up. He said, "What do I need you for? If you don't go, go home!" I had no choice but to go herd the cattle. On the slope, it was so cold that I couldn't stand. My feet were swollen with cold, and I started crying. When I came back in the evening, my father saw it and asked me why my eyes were so red. I said that herding cattle on the mountain was unbearably cold. My father cried too. In the twelfth month, I followed the landlord to Xilutou Village to collect rent. I was told to carry four dou of wheat. I said I couldn't carry it. The steward said, "Why can't you carry it?" As he spoke, he put it on my shoulders. I walked ten steps before being crushed to the ground, my mouth bleeding. I cried loudly, and many people ran over from the village. Seeing this, they all said it weighed over a hundred jin, and this child couldn't possibly carry it. The landlord said: Can I let him eat for free? Even feeding a dog, it has to guard the door. I stumbled back with great difficulty, and my father cried again.

When I was sixteen, I and my father carried a two-hundred-jin load together. The old and the young, we knocked the load onto my father, breaking his collarbone. The landlord didn't reason with us at all. I sent my father home. From then on, my father lay on the bed and fell ill. The landlord, Zhang Jiayu, because my father exposed him for twenty-four silver dollars, heard that my father was sick and returned home. Fearing that my father would die and he wouldn't be able to repay him, he immediately came to my house to ask for it. My father said, "There are only four dou of wheat and two sheng of millet at home. I'm sick like this, and I still want to eat it." Jia Yu said, "If you don't give it to me, can your son pay it back?" My father said, "When I die, there will be two and a half rooms and one mu of dry land, which should be enough." Zhang Jiayu then said, "You have four dou of wheat, why don't you pay the debt?" After speaking, he carried the wheat and left. My father died from his illness and anger.

When I was eighteen, the famine was severe, and there was nothing to eat. I went to the landlord Yang Yaonan's house to beg for some grain. He said, "I still eat white flour." I pleaded with him for a long time, and he finally said that there was some coarse bran left over from feeding the pigs, and I could take it. I quickly filled a sack, knelt down, thanked him, and went back. My wife ground and fried it again, and I went to the fields to find vegetables. This is how we barely survived for half a year. In July, I was sitting on the street. Old Zhang, a worker from the district, saw that my face was yellow and asked if I was sick. I said, "I'm not sick, but I'm starving." Old Zhang said, "Let me find you a job. Can you read?" I said, "I herded cattle when I was young, how could I know how to read?" Old Zhang said, "There is a friend at Qianji Goods Store, let me write you a letter of introduction, take it there." I immediately thanked him, saying, "Old Zhang, you have saved my life." The next day, I set off, but Qianji Goods Store was sixty li away from my village. I begged for food along the way, and walked wearily for three and a half days. I finally arrived at the goods store and gave the letter to Manager An. In the evening, he finally talked to me, saying, "Looking at you, can you even do any work? Go beg for your food, there is no job." I burst into tears. Fortunately, Deputy Manager Cao Huamin interceded, and I was allowed to stay. When I was twenty-two, I went to Yangyi Xinhua Goods Store. The landlord Yang Shenggui was the manager. One day, I was writing a few words on the table. Yang Shenggui said, "Go do another job!" In the evening, he said to others, "Huaiyu was born herding cattle, and he wants to write. I said there's no need to worry about that. Born to be a rafter, you can't make it into a beam." He also said to me, "Your father was a long-term laborer, and you still want to be an accountant? A toad wants to eat swan meat, but it can't reach." I said I didn't want to be an accountant, I just wanted to learn a few words.

Last spring, the Yangyi branch closed down, and the business was no longer done. I went to the Changzhi Bookstore. When I first arrived, I did odd jobs for ten days. One evening, Comrade Du Yaoting said to me, "You will take on clerical work." I said, "My abilities are not strong." He said, "Comrade Pei Ruwei will help you." I didn't know how to write foreign numerals when I first came. Comrade Pei Ruwei first wrote ten foreign numerals for me and told me to practice. He also told me to write copying exercises and keep a diary. He corrected them for me. Now I can keep accounts and write letters to friends and family.

　　伢吃白面咱吃糠  地主的心赛虎狼
    江怀玉
    俺父亲十八岁，就给地主江元梅住长工。我五岁上，俺娘就死了，俺爹与江元梅谈要带上我，地主说：“行是行，得帮些伙食！”俺爹说：“那我少赚几个钱就行。”当年少赚了洋十七元，把我留下。我到八岁上，就与地主看孩子，到十三岁上，就放牛。当年冬十一月二十七日，天下大雪，我就与主家说下雪很大，把牛喂上改天晴了再去放吧。他说：“用你干啥？要不去，你回家去吧！”我无奈放牛去了，坡上，冷的站不住人，把脚冻肿了，就哭起来，晚上回来，俺爹看见，便问我怎么眼红成那个样子？我说上山放牛冷的不行。俺爹也哭了一顿。到腊月，跟上地主去西鹿头村要租子，叫背四斗麦子，我说拿不动，掌柜说为啥拿不动，说着就给我搁在肩膀上，走了十来步远，把我压倒地下，嘴里碰出血，我大哭起来了，村里跑过许多人，看见都说百多斤重，这小孩可是拿不动。地主说：能叫他白吃吗？喂只狗，也得守门哩。东跌西跌好容易回来了，俺爹也哭了一顿。
    到十六岁冬天和俺爹抬二百斤重驮子，老的老小的小，反把驮子跌到俺爹身上，把锁骨折断，地主毫不说理，我把俺爹送回家，从此俺爹躺在坑上一病不起。地主张贾玉，因我爹揭他现洋二十四元，听说俺爹有病回来，怕俺爹死了还不起他，马上来我家要，俺爹说：“家里只有四斗麦子二升小米，我病成这样子，我还想吃哩。”贾玉说：“你不给我，你儿子能还了？”俺爹说：“我死了，有两间半房子，一亩旱地也够了。”张贾玉又说：“你有四斗麦子，为啥不还帐？”说罢就把麦子背上走。俺爹病上加气就死了。
    到十八岁时灾荒很重，没有啥吃，俺到地主杨耀南家央他借些粮食。他说：“有白面，我还吃哩。”俺好话给他说了半天，他才说有喂猪剩下的粗糠，你拿去吧，俺就赶紧装了一口袋，跪下谢了谢他就回来。俺娘们（妻）又碾又炒，俺上地寻菜，就这样糊了半年口。到七月，我在大街上坐着，区上工作员老张看见我脸黄黄的，便问我有病啦？我说：“病是没有，是饿的不行？”老张说：“给你找个工作吧，你识字不？”我说：“幼小放牛，那能识字。”老张说：“谦记货栈有个朋友，给你写上一封信，带上去吧。”我立即感谢的说：“老张你这可救了我命了。”第二天我就起身走，可是谦记货栈离俺村六十里路，我沿路讨饭吃，就软软的走了三天半，好容易到了货栈，把信交给安经理，黄昏，他才与俺谈说：“看你这个样子，也能干工作吗？还去要你的饭去吧，没有工作。”我放声大哭了，幸遇副经理曹化民同志说合，才算把我留下。我到二十二岁上就到阳邑新华货栈，地主杨生桂他是掌柜，有一天我爬在桌面上写了几个字，杨生桂说：“你去干另个工作吧！”到黄昏，他对别人谈：“怀玉是放牛出身，想写字，我说不用操那样心，生下做椽，不能做成梁。”他又对我说：“你爹是长工，你还想当会计，懒蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，可是达不到。”我说并不是想当会计，我想识几个字。
    去年春间，阳邑柜上结束手续，生意不做了，我到了长治书店，初来时做了十来天杂工，一天黄昏，杜耀廷同志给我说：“你担任事务工作。”我说：“能力不强。”他说：“有裴如维同志帮助你”，我才来不会写洋码字，裴如维同志先给我写了十个洋码字，叫我练习，又叫我写盘仿，写日记，他给我改。现在会记帐，又能给朋友们和家里写信了。
