Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th: In the past month, local armed forces in Central China, combined with the broad masses of the people, have crushed the dying "sweep" of Chiang bandit's twelve regiments, annihilating more than 6,000 enemies. The details are as follows: Since the Ye Ting South Campaign (December 26th to 29th last year), Chiang bandit in Central China still attempted to struggle desperately, drawing together forces defending various transportation lines and important towns, totaling twelve regiments, to carry out a "sweep." Successively, ten regiments from the 4th Division, 51st Division, 21st Division, and 23rd Division, etc., invaded Dongtai in Central Jiangsu, one regiment from the 44th Division invaded Donghai and Guanyun in Northern Jiangsu, and the 1563rd Regiment of the 88th Brigade invaded Sixian in Northern Anhui, etc. During the "sweep," Chiang bandit used a policy of destruction. Most of the larger towns in Dongtai were burned down. More than 1,000 households in the famous seaport @ Port were burned, leaving only 35 households. Along the coastal grassland, from Kushuiyang to Tongshangzhen, 60% of more than 40 li was burned into scorched earth. In western Guanyun, Northern Jiangsu, 60,000 people were robbed of 350,000 jin of grain, 210,000 jin of burning grass, and more than 1,530 cattle, donkeys, pigs, and sheep. However, it also exposed the weaknesses of Chiang bandit. The enemy in the "sweep" crawled at a snail's pace. For example, it took a whole day to crawl only ten li from Shizong to Sanzu. Local armed forces in various places combined with the broad masses of the people to bravely persist in the counter-"sweep." Chiang bandit in Dongtai was blocked and suffered more than 40 casualties by the local militia and guerrillas. Local armed forces on the outer lines launched an all-out attack on the enemy's transportation lines and important strongholds. On the first day of January, the local armed forces of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong fought and successively拔(ba) [removed] the strongholds of Nanyang Village, Dong'an Town, etc., on the periphery of Qidong. On the 16th, they fought again near Shigang in Nantong, and on the 23rd, they fought for the third time on the Rugao-Juegang line, capturing the important town of Chahe. On the 26th, they also took the important town of Shigang in Nantong. The local armed forces in Haian and southern Taizhou counties also launched four annihilation battles in less than 20 days (from New Year's Day to the 18th), capturing the important town of Shizhuang in Rugao on the banks of the Yangtze River, and annihilating the enemy near the suburbs of Xuanjiabao in Taixing, near Baimi in Taizhou, near Huangqiao, and other places. The local armed forces in the Huaihai area of Northern Jiangsu harassed the side of the Longhai Railway and captured Lugou, north of Suqian, and other places. The local armed forces in Northern Anhui also advanced to Lingbi and Suxian on the east side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, capturing Gaoji, Chantang, and other places, and sweeping away the local bandits scattered in the countryside. Another unit of the local armed forces also removed enemy strongholds such as Shuangcaiwei on the Si (Xian)-Su (Qian) highway. The local armed forces in various places fought more and more fiercely. The local armed forces in the Ninth Military Subdistrict successively captured Chahe and Shigang in five days, annihilating more than 2,400 enemies. The local armed forces in Taixing also annihilated entire battalions of the enemy's regular army, creating a model for the local armed forces in Central China to fight independently for more than a year. In total, more than 6,000 enemies were annihilated in January alone, and more than 30 enemy strongholds of various sizes were captured. By this point, Chiang bandit's dying "sweep" was completely crushed by us. In the counter-"sweep," the masses in various places also cooperated with the local armed forces in combat. The masses in a certain village established a counter-"sweep" command, organized reconnaissance teams, communication teams, and custody teams (to control local bullies and landlords) to lead the masses in burying supplies, and to deal with the enemy, so that when Chiang bandit came, not a single person, a single carrying pole, or a single rope would be left behind, making it impossible for Chiang bandit to stay in the village. The masses in Zhangxinzhuang, Gaojintang, and other villages in Guanyun used sickles and iron forks to repel more than 500 local Chiang bandits who were looting grain.

    粉碎蒋匪十二个团“扫荡”
    华中上月歼敌六千
    【新华社华东六日电】最近一月来华中地方武装结合广大人民，粉碎蒋匪十二个团的垂死“扫荡”，歼敌六千余人。经过如下：自叶（挺）南战役（去年十二月二十六至二十九）后，华中蒋匪仍图垂死挣扎，抽集防守各交通干线及重要城镇之兵力共十二个团进行“扫荡”，先后以四师、五一师、二一师及二三师等部十个团，犯苏中之东台，以四四师一个团犯苏北之东海、灌云，以八八旅一五六三团犯淮北之泗县等地。“扫荡”中蒋匪使用毁灭政策，东台较大市镇大都被烧光，有名海港＠港一千多户被烧，仅剩三十五户。沿海草原从苦水洋到通商镇，四十余里有十分之六被烧成一片焦土。苏北灌云西部六万人民即被抢去三十五万斤粮食，二十一万斤烧草，和牛驴猪羊一千五百三十多只。但同时也暴露了蒋匪的弱点，“扫荡”之敌，均龟步爬行，如由十总到三组仅十里路就爬了一整天。我各地地方武装则结合广大人民英勇坚持反“扫荡”，东台之蒋匪为该地民兵游击队阻击，杀伤四十余人。外线地方武装全面出击敌之交通线和重要据点，南通、如（皋）东、海门、启东地武于一月初一战，连拔启东外围南阳村、东安镇等据点。十六日再战于南通石港附近，二十三日三战于如（皋）掘（港）线上，攻克岔河重镇。二十六日又拿下南通重镇石港。海安、泰州县南地武，也在不到二十天（元旦至十八日）中连打四次歼灭战，攻下长江边上如皋之石庄重镇，并在泰兴之宣家堡近郊及泰州白米附近、黄桥近郊等地歼敌。苏北淮海地武捣陇海路侧，攻克宿迁北之陆沟等地。淮北地武也挺进津浦路东侧之灵壁、宿县攻克高集、禅堂等地，并扫荡散处乡村之土杂。地武另部又于泗（县）、宿（迁）公路上拔除双蔡圩等敌据点。各地地武越打越猛，九分区地武五天中连克岔河、石港，歼敌二千四百多，泰兴地武也整营的歼敌正规军，创造了华中地武年余以来单独作战的范例。总计一月份一个月中歼敌六千余名，克大小敌据点三十余处。至此，蒋匪的垂死“扫荡”即为我全部粉碎。在反“扫荡”中各地群众亦配合地武作战，某村群众成立反“扫荡”指挥部，组织侦察班、通讯班、看押班（管制恶霸地主）领导群众埋藏物资，并与敌周旋，做到蒋匪来时不留一个人、一根扁担和一条绳子，使蒋匪进村后无法停留。灌云张新庄、高金塘等村群众以镰刀铁叉打退了五百多个抢粮的土蒋匪。
