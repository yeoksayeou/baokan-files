Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 31st: A unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered Goubangzi, an important connecting point on the Beining Line, on the 27th, and annihilated more than 600 fleeing enemies. It is reported that the remnants of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, which guarded Goubangzi, had been partly annihilated by the People's Liberation Army south of Beizhen earlier this month, and were frightened and timid. Recently, after Xinlitun was captured by our forces, the enemy felt even more panicked, so they abandoned their heavily defended strongholds and fled towards Jinzhou on the evening of the 27th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately followed in pursuit, intercepting a portion of them at Shishan Station, more than 70 li southwest of Goubangzi, on the 28th. After a brief battle, they were surrounded and eliminated, capturing more than 600 enemy officers and soldiers, seizing eight mortars, fifteen light and heavy machine guns, more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 1,000 boxes of 60mm mortar shells, and more than 3,000 piculs of grain. After our army recovered Goubangzi, it immediately distributed the captured grain to the poor masses. Goubangzi is the railway connecting point on the Beining Line and the Yingkou branch line of the Middle-East Railway. After this liberation, Jinzhou, the enemy's important supply base, is even more exposed. (Attached image)

    北宁线我军进驻沟帮子
    威胁蒋匪重要补给基地锦州城
    【新华社东北前线三十一日电】东北解放军一部二十七日进驻北宁线上重要联接点沟帮子，并歼逃敌六百余人。按据守沟帮子之敌六十军一八四师残部，自本月上旬在北镇南为解放军歼灭一部后，即胆寒心怯，近因新立屯被我攻克，该敌更感恐慌，遂放弃其坚固设防据点，于二十七日黄昏向锦州逃窜。解放军一部当即跟踪追击，二十八日在沟帮子西南七十余里之石山车站截获其一部，略经战斗，即将其包围解决，计活捉敌官兵六百余名，缴获迫击炮八门、轻重机枪十五挺、子弹二十余万发、迫击炮六○炮弹千余箱、粮食三千余石。我军收复沟帮子后，当即以缴获之粮分给贫苦群众。按沟帮子系北宁线及中长线营口支线上之铁路联接点，此次解放后，敌重要补给基地之锦州，更加裸露。(附图片）
