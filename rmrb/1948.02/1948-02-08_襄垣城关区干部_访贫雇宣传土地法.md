    Xiangyuan Chengguan District Cadres
    Visit Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers to Propagandize the Land Law
    [Xiangyuan News] On the 25th of last month, the Chengguan District of Xiangyuan, after reading the short commentary "Go to Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers to Propagandize the Land Law" published in the People's Daily on the 22nd, held a meeting of district cadres on the 26th to study and decided to visit poor peasants and hired laborers door-to-door to understand the situation and propagandize the Land Law. Comrade Sun Laicheng, chairman of the district trade union, went to Xiguan and first met with the cadres to talk about the propaganda of the Land Law in the village and the reflections of the masses, as well as the production and living conditions of the poor peasants and hired laborers. Street chief Zhang Jinsheng said: "The Land Law in our street has been read in the people's school, and the masses have responded well. The emancipation of the poor peasants and hired laborers in our street is almost complete. There are no most or least, and everyone has enough to eat now. There are no beggars." Later, Comrade Sun was introduced by the cadres to three poor peasants to talk with them. The result was that these poor peasants had already been thoroughly emancipated and had received more than their share of the fruits of labor. They did not fully understand the Land Law, but simply said they agreed with it. Comrade Sun felt that he could not learn anything from this, so he stopped using the cadres and instead went to find poor peasants and hired laborers on his own. He found Jin Huanchun's house and talked to him about the Land Law Outline. He said, "Outline or no outline, we live in Xiangyuan, the place with the most coal, but we don't even have coal in our house. We burn firewood." At this time, Comrade Sun talked about his emancipation and his family's living conditions. Jin's wife said, "The quilt we got was even more ragged than a worn-out set of clothes, half lining and half surface. We also got two cave dwellings and three broken houses. Once, when we went to the meeting to distribute the fruits of labor, the cadres scolded us, saying, 'Look at this poor wretch of a woman, coming to share the fruits of labor!'" His family is currently eating bran and vegetables, and they will run out of grain by the end of the first lunar month. This winter, they borrowed 20,000 yuan, but they didn't earn a penny. He is currently sick in bed and cannot get up. He said, "We are outsiders, and we don't dare to express our opinions. I heard that the Land Law is coming, teaching everyone to say what they want, to be completely democratic, but it hasn't been implemented yet. When it is implemented, I will tell you about our suffering!" Later, Comrade Sun went to Dou Suozhu's house. He said, "Once in February this year, we distributed the fruits of labor. I heard that I was given 1.3 dou of rice. I went to ask Tiecheng (the instructor at the time), and I said, 'Where did the rice that was allocated to me go?' He got very angry and said, 'Am I shortchanging you on rice? Come and ask me for rice!' Later, I went to ask the brigade leader, Tie Dan (the militia captain), and he scolded me, saying, 'Now that the Eighth Route Army has come, you want rice? You would have starved to death in the days of the enemy, you son of a bitch!' Later, I didn't dare to ask again. Once, District Chief Han saw me and asked me how my life was. I said that my family was currently eating bran and vegetables. District Chief Han asked me if I had finished the rice that was allocated to me. I said I hadn't received it. District Chief Han went to ask the street chief, and the street chief ran to my house and said, 'The rice is at my house. Tell me when you need it and I'll give it to you.' The first time my child went to get it, they said there was no rice. The second time they went to get it, they gave four dou of empty corn cobs, which was equivalent to two dou of rice. They also said that corn cobs can be eaten more. The third time they went to get it, the street chief's wife closed the door and wouldn't let my child into the house. Later, I asked people again, and they said to go to the cooperative to ask for it. I went to ask the cooperative, but the director didn't know. This one pushed to that one, and that one pushed to this one. Finally, they gave me eight dou of rice. There are still three dou of rice that haven't been given to me." His family is now eating bran and vegetables, corn cobs and elm leaf dry food, without a single grain of rice. He is sick in bed and cannot get up. Three families like Dou's, who are on the verge of starvation, have already been discovered. When talking to many other people, they don't understand what the Land Law is all about. Deputy Street Chief Li Kui distorted the Land Law completely when he talked to poor peasants like Shen Jincai. He said, "I know everything about the Land Law. It is about communism, concentrating all the land and things in one place and dividing them equally. The livestock is brought to one place and everyone shares it. The grain is concentrated in one place and everyone shares it. Landlords and rich peasants share equally. In the future, the money earned will be handed over to the public. Every ten families eat out of one big pot, and everyone goes home to sleep at night." After discovering these problems, the reasons were preliminarily understood. The main reason is that during last year's movement, the cadres occupied too much of the fruits of labor of the masses. Street chief Zhang Jinsheng stole several bags of beans from the oil mill. The work in the past was done by包办 (Baoban, take on the responsibility of everything). Old man Li Jinkui said that in the past, the distribution of the fruits of labor was done by the cadres, and whatever the cadres gave was what you got. Whatever the cadres saw that was good, they wanted it. Although these cadres are from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds, they have forgotten their roots. They repeatedly say that poor peasants and hired laborers have no difficulties, but the result of the inspection is that poor peasants and hired laborers have nothing to eat. Poor peasants and hired laborers have difficulties in winter production, but they have never helped a single poor peasant and hired laborer find a way out of production or solve practical difficulties.

    襄垣城关区干部
    访贫雇宣传土地法
    【襄垣消息】襄垣城关区上月二十五号，看到人民日报二十二号登的短论：“到贫雇中宣传土地法”一文后，二十六号城关区召开了区干部会研究，决定了到贫雇家挨门挨户的了解情况，宣传土地法。区职工主席孙来成同志到了西关，事先找见了干部，谈了谈村里宣传土地法的情况与群众的反映，和贫雇的生产与生活情况。街长张金生说：我街土地法已在民校上读了，群众反映好，贫雇的翻身我街都差不多，亦没有最多的，亦没有最少的，现生活上都有吃的，没有要饭吃的了。后孙同志由干部介绍了三个贫雇去谈，结果是这些贫农，原来都已翻透身，而且多分了果实。对土地法亦不完全了解，只是说同意。孙同志感觉了解不到啥，后才不用干部，自己生摸，找贫雇。找到靳焕春家，谈土地法大纲，他说：“大纲不大纲吧，咱住在襄垣顶不缺煤的地方，咱家还没煤，烧的是柴。”这时孙同志就谈他的翻身和家里的生活情况，靳的老婆说：“分了个被子比烂套还破，半表半面，还分了二间窑、三间破房。有一次分果实咱到了会上，人家干部们骂，看这个穷命老婆，还来分果实！”他家里现吃的是糠菜，粮食吃不过阴历正月就一点都没有了。今冬贷了二万元款，一毛钱未赚，现正病在炕上不能起身。他说：“咱是外来人，肚里有意见不敢提，我听说来了土地法，教大家有啥说啥，彻底民主，现在没执行开，等将来执行开把咱的苦也诉一诉吧！”后孙同志又到了窦锁柱家，他说：“今年二月有一次分果实哩，我听到给我分了一石三斗米，我去问铁成（当时指导员），我说给我分的米那去了，人家很起火，说：我短的你米哩？来和我要米！后我又去问大队长铁旦（自卫队长），人家骂了我一顿，说现在八路军来了，你要米哩，敌人在时早饿死你狗日了，后我亦没敢再问。有一次韩区长见了我，问我生活如何？我说家里现全吃的是糠菜。韩区长问我给你分配的米吃完了？我说没得住。韩区长去问街长，街长才跑到我家说：米在他家哩，教我啥时用啥时去取。第一次我孩去取了，人家说没米，第二次去取给了四斗空圪芦玉茭，顶了二斗米，人家还说，玉茭能多吃颗。第三次去取，街长的女人把大门关住不教俺孩进家，以后又问人家，说教去合作社要哩，去问合作社，社长不知道，这个推那个，那个推这个，最后算给了八斗米，直到现在还有三斗米没给。”他家现在吃的是糠菜，玉茭圪生和榆叶干粮，没有一颗米，病在炕上不能起身。象窦家这种马上没法生活的已发现三家，另和好多人谈起来，都不了解土地法到底是怎么一回事。副街长李魁则给贫农申进才等人谈土地法，将土地法完全歪曲了，他说：“土地法我啥也知道，是要共产，把所有的地、东西集中到一处平分，牲口拉到一处大家分，粮食集中到一处大家分，地主富农同样分，以后赚上钱交公家，每十家一口大锅吃饭，黑夜各回各家睡觉。”发现这些问题后，初步了解了一下原因，主要是去年运动中，干部多占了群众果实，街长张金生从油坊偷背走好几袋豆。过去的工作上是包办的。李进奎老汉说过去分果实是由干部们给分上啥算啥，干部们看见那样好就要了那样。这些干部成份虽然是贫雇，但已忘了本，口口声声说贫雇没困难，结果检查出来贫雇没吃的。贫雇冬产困难，但他们从未去帮助过一个贫雇找生产出路，解决实际困难（建魁、海昌、来成、怀智、武仕）
