    [Taiyue News] Chiang bandit "officials" in Tongguan, in order to embezzle and pocket funds, under the guise of reorganizing the troops, enlisted physically strong new recruits, while grouping the disabled and sick into a separate unit, or even abandoning them altogether, or forcing them to cross the river to their deaths. On December 15th, this unit of bandit troops forced fifty-four disabled soldiers to cross the river eastward to their deaths (i.e., the north bank of the Yellow River at Fenglingdu). At the time, many soldiers burst into tears as they boarded the ship, saying, "Officials! You might as well shoot us all with machine guns, to save us from freezing to death in the Yellow River." Amidst the chaotic cries, the Chiang bandits brought in a company to escort them by boat, forcing them onto the boat. Upon reaching the Dajia shoal in the middle of the river, they drove these soldiers off the boat and returned. This shoal was in the middle of the river, with high water on both sides, and it was the middle of the night. Everyone cried and screamed, and they had no choice but to wade into the water and escape to the east bank, our side. By the time they reached the shore, nine had already frozen to death or been swept away. The rest were rescued and saved by our river defense troops. According to them, they were all conscripted into the army last August, and had not seen their parents, wives, or children since they left. After they came over, the deputy battalion commander of our Independent Battalion treated them well, which greatly moved everyone.

    蒋匪逼士兵送死被我营救得活命
    【太岳消息】潼关蒋匪“官长”为了贪污吃空子，在整顿部队名义下，将体格强壮的新编入伍，对残废有病的，另编一部，甚至干脆扔掉或逼使过河送死。十二月十五日，该部匪军，将残废士兵五十四人，逼过河东送死（即风陵渡黄河北岸），当时，在上船时，许多士兵大放哭声，都说：“官长！你不如用机枪把我们都打死，免得下黄河内冻死。”乱哭声中，蒋匪调来一个连，乘船押送，硬逼上船，走到当河大夹滩上，将这些士兵赶下船来，他们返回，这滩在当河，两边大水，又在半夜，大家哭叫，只好下水往河东我方逃命，到登岸时，已冻死、漂走九名，其余被我河防部队营救得活。据他们说，都是去年八月被抓丁当了兵的，在走时，都未见过自己的父母妻儿。在过来后，我独立营副营长好加招待，大家很受感动。
