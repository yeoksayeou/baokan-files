Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 20th: After universally examining thoughts and work styles while studying Chairman Mao's report, all commanders and fighters of the 38th Army, led by Kong Congzhou of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, have made significant progress. The study began with the cadres. First, Army Commander Kong and Political Commissar Wang Feng conveyed the military and political sections, respectively, in light of the actual conditions of their unit. Then, the regiments gathered cadres to examine their work and thoughts, linking this examination with strategic and tactical thinking and combat style. Everyone was in a state of intense and fervent activity. Many cadres worked tirelessly, reflecting actively, and waging a merciless struggle against the bad thoughts and work styles brought from the old army and the old society. They liquidated the remaining bad habits of warlordism and bureaucracy, eradicated the phenomenon of cadres beating and scolding soldiers, and greatly improved officer-soldier relations. After the study came to a close, cadres at all levels automatically carried their packs to the companies to help with work, mingled with the soldiers, and promoted soldiers to reflect on their actions and examine their leaders. In the general examination of thought, the soldiers combined commendation and merit recording and established company-level soldiers' committees. From the 15th of last month, a certain regiment first had the main cadres of each battalion and company give typical self-criticisms at the soldiers' meeting. The soldiers were deeply moved. Some immediately requested to reflect on their mistakes, and some took the initiative to talk to the instructors about their shortcomings after the meeting. Although the study only lasted four days, it greatly improved revolutionary consciousness, mass discipline, and established the idea of serving the people. At the same time, the companies carried out commendations and merit recording, praising comrades who worked hard, were loyal, and brave. After the establishment of the soldiers' committee, the democratic spirit was fully developed, which was warmly supported by the soldiers. The newly liberated soldiers who had joined the army not long ago were even more deeply moved. Liberated soldier Zhou Daowen said: "I just came to this army. I originally thought it was the same as the Central Army (Chiang bandits). After this study, I realized that this army is truly for the people. I will stick with this army to the end."
