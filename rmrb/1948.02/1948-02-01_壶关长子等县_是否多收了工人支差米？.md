Criticism and Suggestions

    Huguan, Changzi, and other counties
    Did they overcollect labor service grain from workers?

    To the Editor:
    The Taihang Administrative Office issued an order last December deciding on the method for workers to bear labor service. The general idea is that the labor service grain burden of workers should be collected by the governments of the locations where the factories are located. We have also received orders from the Taihang Third Administrative Office and Changzhi City that, starting from November of last year, the labor service grain of factory workers in our city should be handed over to the Changzhi Municipal Government, and villages should not be allowed to collect it. We have implemented this order, but the villages of origin of the workers have not implemented it accordingly, and they are still collecting it, and there are phenomena of over-collection. Such as Qingliu Village, Hancun Village, Guangbi Village in Huguan County, and Chenjiazhuang, Southwest Cheng, etc. in Changzi County. There are also other counties like this. This results in workers bearing a double burden, making them uneasy about their work. We have also sent official letters to negotiate on this matter, but after many exchanges, they have not been effective. Therefore, I request your help in solving this problem. Is it that the county governments have not conveyed the order of the Taihang Third Administrative Office? Or perhaps the districts and villages have not implemented this order? The relevant county, district, and village cadres should strictly check and pay attention to such irresponsible work styles of not implementing orders.

    壶关长子等县
    是否多收了工人支差米？编辑同志：
    太行行署去年十二月有命令，决定工厂工人劳力负担办法。大意是工人的支差负担米，由各工厂所在地的政府征收。我们并已接到太行三专署及长治市命令，从去年十一月份起，本市工厂工人的支差米交给长治市政府，各村不得征派。这个命令我们执行了，而工人原籍各村并未照此执行，仍然派收，且有多派的现象产生。如壶关县清流村、韩村、广壁村，及长子县陈家庄、西南呈等。还有其他县也如此。这样一来，使得工人出双重负担，工作不安心。这种事情，我们亦曾去公函交涉，但往还多次，也有不发生效力的。因此，我请求你们帮助解决。是不是各县政府未传达太行三专署命令？或许是各区、村未执行这个命令？象这样对命令不执行，不负责的工作作风，有关各县、区、村干部应严格检查注意才是。
