    [News from Our Newspaper] The Border Region Government plans to distribute 10 million jin of millet this year, mainly to provide relief for the spring famine and support spring plowing. A small portion will be reserved for emergency relief in the second half of the year. Based on the current disaster situation and relief conditions in various regions, it has been decided to allocate 7.3 million jin of budgeted relief grain from the Border Region as follows: 3 million jin to Taihang, 2 million jin to Jinnan, 1.6 million jin to Ji-Lu-Yu, and 700,000 jin to Taiyue. This relief grain will be primarily used for work relief programs, such as constructing and repairing railways, highways, roads, and bridges; preventing and controlling floods; developing water conservancy projects (e.g., building dikes, dredging rivers, opening canals, and digging wells); and planting trees. The labor of disaster-stricken people will be utilized to develop construction projects. In disaster areas with conditions suitable for work relief, disaster victims must be organized to participate in work relief programs, with the poorest peasants who have been most severely affected being the main beneficiaries. Wages should be slightly higher than the local average for short-term labor. The construction period should not interfere with the famine relief season or affect land reform.
    In disaster areas lacking the conditions for implementing work relief, efforts will be made to organize the masses for production and self-help, creating various production conditions for disaster victims and transforming the relief grain into capital for production and self-help, thus overcoming the famine through production to avoid simply consuming the grain. To ensure the smooth completion of the task, disaster areas implementing work relief should have relevant departments appoint dedicated personnel to form work relief committees to uniformly lead construction and relief efforts. In disaster areas where production and self-help are the primary focus, the construction department will be responsible for carrying out production and famine relief work.

    边府发救济米一千万斤
    以工代赈救济春荒
    【本报消息】边区政府本年预定发放救济粮一千万斤小米，主要用于救济春荒、支持春耕，小部暂保留作下半年紧急救济使用。根据当前各地灾情及救灾条件，决定先将边区预算救济粮七百卅万斤，分配给太行三百万斤，冀南二百万斤，冀鲁豫一百六十万斤，太岳七十万斤。此项救济粮食主要用于以工代赈，如兴修补修铁路、公路、大路、桥梁，防治水患，兴修水利（如修堤、疏河、开渠、凿井），及播种造林等。利用灾民劳力，兴办建设事业。凡有以工代赈条件的灾区，必须组织灾民进行以工代赈，以被灾最重的贫苦农民为主要对象，工资要稍高于当地一般短工工资。施工时间，以不误渡荒季节，又不影响土地改革为原则。
    缺乏施行以工代赈条件的灾区，则用于组织群众生产自救，为灾民创造各种生产条件，把救济粮作成生产自救资本，从生产中渡过灾荒，以免吃光了事。为保证任务的顺利完成，以工代赈的灾区应由有关部门指派专人组成工赈委员会，统一领导施工及救济事宜。以生产自救为主要的灾区，则由建设部门负责，进行生产渡荒工作。
