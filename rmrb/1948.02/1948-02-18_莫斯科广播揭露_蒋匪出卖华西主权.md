    Moscow Broadcast Reveals
    Chiang Kai-shek Clique Sells Out Sovereignty of Southwest China
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th – Moscow Radio broadcasted a commentary by Kibanov on the 8th, revealing that the Kuomintang is exchanging the sovereignty of South and Southwest China for American money. The commentary stated: "Recently, in Wall Street, one can often encounter H.H. Kung, one of the comprador heads of the four major families, and Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank and a comprador of the Song family. These two fellows are paying homage to American capitalists, begging them to lend some money in an attempt to save the ultimately bankrupt Kuomintang regime. The current Kuomintang lords are indeed in a miserable situation, crying and wailing." It further pointed out: "In order to make their master, the Americans, more generous, the Kuomintang reactionaries have tied China even more tightly to the chains of American enslavement. Zhang Qun swore in a letter to Truman that "we will implement certain 'reform' measures," which is what this means. American monopoly capitalists are not satisfied with the Kuomintang giving them Taiwan and southern China. They plan to penetrate Inner Mongolia and southwestern and western China. Under the pretext of the Kuomintang reactionaries "relieving the Mongols with charitable hearts," an American mission went to Inner Mongolia to study the possibility of American capitalists and the American army entering Inner Mongolia. In Yunnan, a capitalist named Charlie Carter and other American capitalists are working hard to seize the tin mines of Yunnan. The Renault expedition team, established in January and February this year, seems to be testing the height of the unexplored mountains in Qinghai, and using the excuse that the height of Mount Anymachen (i.e., Mount 積石) is higher than previously discovered. The Shanghai News revealed that the work the expedition team will engage in is to find uranium mines." The article emphasized: "The Chinese people are very clear that no loan can save the dying reactionary Kuomintang regime. The reactionary Kuomintang adventurers have borrowed 483 million US dollars from the Americans, but the People's Liberation Army has not only not been "defeated," but has gradually liberated the Northeast from the hands of the Kuomintang and is approaching Nanjing and Shanghai. The Kuomintang economic crisis has also worsened.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – Nanjing News: The "Sino (Chiang)-American Exploration Team Cooperation Agreement," a symbol of the deepening of the aggressive claws of American imperialism into western China, was signed in Nanjing on the 7th by American representative W. Hingston and Chiang Kai-shek clique representative Sa Pen-tung, and was formally approved by the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan on the 11th. The agreement stipulates that the team will be headed by Renault, manager of the American Atomic Pen Company, and W. Hingston, director of the Boston Museum, will be the exploration guidance director. The Chiang Kai-shek side will only appoint an "honorary head" and "advisor." The team members include Major Yang Dize of the Nanjing US Military Advisory Group (who, in the late stage of our War of Resistance Against Japan, led American military personnel deep into Xikang and other places under the pretext of searching for American military remains). Each exploration will be accompanied by an American military liaison officer, fully demonstrating the military aggressive nature of the American undertaking. The main area of activity of the exploration team is between 96 and 103 degrees east longitude and 29 and 36 degrees north latitude (including the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, and Sichuan). Within this area, the United States will use Chengdu as the main base and Lanzhou as the secondary base. Specially modified bombers will be used to carry measuring instruments and personnel. These aircraft can land in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and any other location. The team will conduct aerial and ground surveys and photography, one copy of which will be sent to the US for preservation. The exploration period is limited to three months. The agreement shows that the Chiang Kai-shek clique has granted the United States broad powers. The American side of the team can "enter into contracts" with any country or private organization. The agreement reveals that this aggressive activity by the United States involves the collection of information on defense, resources, and commerce in western China.

    莫斯科广播揭露
    蒋匪出卖华西主权
    【新华社陕北十五日电】莫斯科电台八日广播基盘诺夫评论，揭露国民党正以出卖中国华南和西南主权，换取美帝金钱。评论称：“在最近这个时期内，在华尔街常常可以遇见身为四大家族买办头子之一的孔祥熙，和前中央银行总裁宋系大买办贝祖诒，这两个家伙正在向美国大资本家拜门请求借给他们一些金钱，图以挽救国民党制度的最终破产。现在的国民党老爷们的确是处于啼哭交加的悲惨情况中。”继指出：“国民党反动派为了使自己的主子美国人更慷慨起见，就把中国更紧紧的拴在美国奴役的锁链下。张群曾在给杜鲁门的信里发誓说：“我们将实行某些‘改良’办法”，就是这个意思。美国独占资本家对国民党让给他们台湾和中国南部，尚不满足。他们打算深入内蒙古及中国西南部与西部。在国民党反动派“以慈善心情救济蒙古人”的借口下，美国使团曾到了内蒙古，以便研究美国资本家与美国军队进入内蒙的可能。在云南，一个叫查尔利卡的和其他的美国资本家，正在努力将云南的锡矿抓到自己的手中。今年一、二月成立的雷诺考察团，好象是要测验在青海尚未勘察之山脉高度，并且借口说：阿尼马卿山（按即积石山）的高度比过去发现的还要高。而上海新闻报曾透露出消息称：该考察团将从事的工作是找铀矿。”该文着重指出：“中国人民十分清楚，知道无论任何的贷款都不能挽救行将灭亡的反动的国民党政权。反动的国民党冒险主义者已由美国人那里借到了四十万万八千三百万美元，然而人民解放军不但没有被“击溃”，相反地却把东北逐渐由国民党手中解放出来，并且已接近了南京和上海。而国民党经济危机也更加恶化起来了。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】南京讯：标志美帝国主义侵略魔爪深入我国西部的“中（蒋）美探测团合作约文”，已于七日下午，由美帝代表华锡朋、蒋匪代表萨本栋在南京签订，并已由蒋匪行政院于十一日正式批准。约文中规定该团以美国原子笔公司经理雷诺为团长，波士顿博物馆馆长华锡朋为探测指导长。而蒋匪方面则仅任“名誉团长”及“顾问”。团员中规定有南京美军顾问团杨帝泽少校（他曾在我国抗战后期，以搜寻美军尸骸为借口，率领美军事人员深入西康等地活动）参加，每次探测时均由美国军事联络官随行，充分显示美帝从事此项探测的军事侵略性质。探测团活动的主要范围为东经九十六度至一百零三度，北纬二十九度至三十六度（按包括甘肃、青海、西康、四川四省省境），在此地区内，美帝将以成都为主要基地、兰州为副基地，以经过特别改装之轰炸机装载测量仪器及人员，此项飞机并可在上海、南京、汉口及其他任何地点降落，该团将进行空中及地面勘测与摄影，其中一份，送交美方保存。探测期限定为三个月。约文中显示蒋匪给予美帝广泛权力，该团美方可与任何国家及私人团体“订立契约”。约文中透露：美帝此一侵略活动涉及我国西部国防、资源、商业等多方面资料之搜集。
