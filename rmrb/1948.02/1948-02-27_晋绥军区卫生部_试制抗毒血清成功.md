Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 23rd: The Health Department of the Military Region has successfully experimented with the trial production of tetanus antitoxin serum using substitutes. The department noted that there were many tetanus patients during the war, and tetanus antitoxin serum was difficult to purchase and easily expired. Doctors such as Li Zhizhong used kerosene lamps instead of incubators, wine bottles instead of flasks, and small air pumps instead of large automatic air pumps for bacterial filtration, pumping day and night. Since there were no guinea pigs or white mice available to determine the potency and antitoxin (serum) units, they were replaced with rabbits for testing. After more than half a year of dedicated research and overcoming various difficulties, the trial production was finally successful. The first batch of antitoxin serum has now been sent to the front lines.

  　试制抗毒血清成功
    【新华社晋绥二十三日电】军区卫生部以代用品，试制破伤风抗毒素血清已实验成功。该部以战争中破伤风患者甚多，而破伤风抗毒素血清则难于购买，且易过期失效。李志中等医生即以煤油灯代替孵箱，酒瓶代替烧瓶，细菌过滤时没有大的自动抽气机代以小抽气筒，日夜不停的抽，对毒力单位及抗毒素（血清）单位的测定无天竺鼠或小白鼠可用，遂代之以家兔试验。经过半年以上潜心研究，克服多种困难，终于试制成功。现第一批抗毒素血清已送达前线。
