    Criticism and Suggestions

    To the Editor:
    On the 23rd, it was snowing heavily and the weather was very cold. A logistics regiment of a certain unit, with 22 people and 22 animals, stayed in our village. When the village cadres saw their own troops coming, they immediately looked for accommodation. Before the houses were found, they took action themselves and arbitrarily claimed houses, with a very bad attitude. Of course, the weather was too cold, and it was inevitable that they were anxious, so we can't blame them. But when they found the house of Wang Guoming, a military dependent, whose family consisted of five people, including his wife, children, and an ox, the whole family pleaded with the platoon leader to ask the village cadres to help them find another place to live. The platoon leader's reply was threatening, and he seemed to want to beat and scold them, saying, "This place is really stubborn!" This frightened the whole family into silence. They also dragged their ox into the snowy yard and fed their animals inside the house. Later, platoon leader Xu Qianzhi, with a furious face, asked the village cadres for grass, and said, "I give you three minutes to chop it and send it over." This frightened the village cadres so much that they had to chop it themselves, and in their haste, they chopped a piece of their hand, and bled a lot. In the evening, they also wanted 31 quilts, saying that they wouldn't do with one less. The village head was very embarrassed. The platoon leader said, "Your village cadres don't care about us and are not responsible." After a lot of talk, they went to the homes of the people themselves to find quilts. One woman only had one quilt, but they forced her to take it away. The village cadres estimated that each person had one quilt, and since there were only 22 people in the unit, it was unreasonable to ask for 31. They planned to find one for each of them. But they insisted on having 31, and it was only after much persuasion that they gave up.
    They stayed for two nights. When they left, they settled the accounts for rice and fodder. The rice they ate was paid for, which was relatively reasonable. But they used 462 catties of grass, and only paid ten yuan per catty (the local market price is 33 yuan per catty). We would like to ask the editor how this should be handled according to the regulations. After they left, the masses all said: "We heard in winter school that the army and the people should unite, so why are there still such troops in the Eighth Route Army?" This letter also represents the opinions of the masses. We hope the editor will answer it.
    Zhang Lide, Winter School Reading Group, Xiangshan Village, Tenth District, Cixian County. January 28th.
    The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people. They shed blood and sweat to fight the Chiang bandits in order to protect the people and help them to turn over. The people also support them, so the army and the people are united. However, there are also a few people in the People's Liberation Army who have shortcomings and do not abide by mass discipline, causing friction with the people, like the platoon leader of the logistics regiment in this case. The people should supervise and report these people, and the leaders of the troops should inspect and educate them. Of course, the people's grass should be paid for at the market price. It is wrong to pay less.

### 磁县香山村群众提意见  请辎重团检查群众纪律

专栏：批评与建议

    磁县香山村群众提意见  请辎重团检查群众纪律编辑同志：
    二十三号那天，大雪纷飞天气很冷，某部辎重团廿二人，牵牲口二十二头，住在敝村。村干部看见自己的队伍来了，就马上找住址。不等房子找下，他们自己动手、随便号了房子，态度很坏。当然天气太冷，免不了着急，也不能怪他们。但他们找到抗属王国名家，他家妻子老小共五口，有一头牛，全家都恳求排长，想叫村干部帮他们另找房住，排长的答复很象威胁，似乎还想打骂，说：“这地方真顽固！”吓得他全家不敢吭声。又把他家的牛拉在雪院，把他们的牲口喂到房里。后来，排长许阡芝满面怒容向村干部要草，并且说：“限三分钟铡好送来。”吓的村干部只得亲自去铡，慌的连手都铡了一块，流了很多血。到了晚上又要被子三十一条，说少一条也不行。村长很作难。排长说：“你们村干部对我们不关心，不负责任。”谈了一大堆，他们又自己到老百姓家里找被子，有一户女人只一条被子，也强迫着拿走了。村干部估计每人一条被子，队伍只有二十二人，要三十一条不合理，打算替他们每人找一条。但他们非要三十一条不行，后来说了多少好话才算了。
    住了两夜，临走时算米票草料帐，米吃的给的，比较合理。但用了四百六十二斤草，每斤只按十元发（当地行市每斤是三十三元），究竟按制度该怎么办，请编者答复一下。他们走后，群众都说：冬学里听报，说军民团结，为什么八路军还有这样的队伍呢？这个信的意见也是群众要求，请编辑回答为盼。
    磁县十区香山村冬学读报组张立德  一月二十八日
    解放军是老百姓的队伍，他为保护老百姓翻身，流血流汗打蒋匪。老百姓也拥护他，所以军民是团结的。但是解放军里也有少数有缺点的人，不遵守群众纪律，和老百姓闹蹩扭，象辎重团排长这个样子。老百姓对这些人应该监督告发，队伍上的负责人应该检查教育。用了老百姓的草，当然应该按市价付钱，少给了是不对的。            ——编者
