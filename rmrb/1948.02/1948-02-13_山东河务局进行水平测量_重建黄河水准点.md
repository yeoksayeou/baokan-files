Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th: The Shandong River Bureau, considering that the Yellow River levee has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in the loss of benchmark points (i.e., standard water levels) and the inability to verify the height differences of the levee, which affects future Yellow River management and levee repair, specially dispatched a survey team before the new year to conduct a level survey and rebuild benchmark points. Within twenty days, the team completed a survey of 128 kilometers along the river from Jixian Village in Kenli (newly established county, northeast of Lijin) westward to Guiren Town in Huimin, establishing a benchmark point every kilometer. At the same time, topographic maps of dangerous works were surveyed and mapped at Mata in Pu-Taiwan and Qijiazui in Lijin, preparing for the construction of training dikes. The team plans to fully complete the plane surveying and mapping of all dangerous works from Kenli upstream to Zhangli before June this year.

    山东河务局进行水平测量
    重建黄河水准点
    【新华社华东九日电】山东省河务局以黄河大堤多年失修，失去水准点（即水的标准位置）、大堤高低比差无从稽考，影响今后治黄修堤之进行，特于年前派出测量队进行水平测量，重建水准点。二十天内，该队完全由垦利（新设县利津东北）集贤村沿河向西到惠民归仁镇一二八公里的测量，并每隔一公里设立了一个水准点。同时分别在蒲台湾的麻、利津的綦家嘴测绘险工地形图，准备修套坝。该队计划于今年六月前全力完成下自垦利上至章历之所有险工的平面图测绘。
