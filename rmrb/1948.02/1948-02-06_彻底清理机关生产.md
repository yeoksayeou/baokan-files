    Thoroughly Clean Up Agency Production
    The Central Bureau has announced a decision on cleaning up agency production and has established a region-wide cleanup committee to be responsible for leading cleanup work in various locations. This is an important measure in our region's efforts to rectify rear-area agencies and fully support the front lines.
    According to preliminary statistics, the total amount of funds for agency production in departments supplied by the border region's grain and funds reaches approximately 600,000,000 yuan (excluding those belonging to individuals and borrowers). Although these agency productions have provided some subsidies to the expenses of their respective units, the vast majority are engaged in commercial speculation. As a result, the phenomenon of infringing on the interests of the masses, and even corruption and embezzlement, is quite common. Some units rely on agency production (with funds exceeding 50,000,000 yuan), spending money arbitrarily and wastefully. Other units, however, have low incomes from agency production, and their difficulties cannot be solved. Now, all funds from agency production will be collected as border region fiscal revenue, and additional necessary expenses will be uniformly issued to replace the original difference subsidized by agency production. This will not only save the border region's annual fiscal revenue and expenditure but also balance the treatment of various units and eliminate corruption and waste. Agency production occupies a large number of miscellaneous personnel. For example, the entire staff of the Border Government is only 150, while production personnel number 200. Cixian County Government has fewer than 50 people, but production personnel number more than 80. After the end of agency production, these personnel can be transferred to work in other departments. The financial and human resources to support the front lines will be greatly enhanced!
    In Handan and Changzhi, agency production accounts for more than half of all industry and commerce. In Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other places, it accounts for 70%. In this way, the development of private capital is bound to be suppressed. The Central Bureau has decided to abolish all agency production and has made it clear that "if they are factories, workshops, or shops that are beneficial to the local area, they can be transferred to local cooperatives or private management at a price." This will enable some industrialists and businessmen to dare to operate freely and stimulate the development of private capital.
    Cleanup work is not only the responsibility of finance, economics and production departments, but all comrades should fully recognize its great significance and unite to care for revolutionary property, preventing anyone from taking advantage of loopholes to embezzle, waste, or steal property!

### 彻底清理机关生产

    彻底清理机关生产
    中央局公布了关于清理机关生产的决定，并成立全区清理委员会，负责领导各地清理工作。这是我区整顿后方机关全力支援前线中一项重要的措施。
    据初步统计：由边区粮款供给的部门的机关生产，资金总数达六十万万元左右（属于个人及借贷者在外）。这些机关生产，虽然对本单位的经费有所补助，但绝大部分均系从事商业投机。因而侵犯群众利益，以至贪污腐化的现象相当普遍。某些单位因有机关生产的依靠（有资金达五万万以上者），随便开支，铺张浪费。而另一些单位，机关生产收入不大，困难则无法解决。现在所有机关生产的资金，全部收作边区财政收入，再统一增发各项必须的经费，代替原来由机关生产补助的差额。这样做，不仅全年边区财政收支，可以节约，而且使各单位的待遇平衡，杜绝贪污浪费。机关生产占了很大一批干杂人员。如边府全部人员才一百五十，而生产人员却有二百，磁县县政府不到五十人，而生产人员却有八十多，机关生产结束之后，这些人员都可以转入其他部门工作了。支援前线的财力、人力，得以大大增强！
    邯郸、长治两市，全部工、商业中，机关生产在一半以上，阳城、晋城等地，更占了百分之七十。这样，私人资本的发展势必遭受了压抑。中央局决定取消一切机关生产，而且明确指出：“如系工厂作坊及对地方有益的商店，可作价转让当地合作社或私人经营”。这就使一部工商业家敢于放手经营，刺激私人资本的发展。
    清理工作不仅是财经、生产部门的责任，全体同志都应充分认识其重大意义，一致起来关心革命财产，防止任何人钻空贪污浪费、窃取财物的企图！
