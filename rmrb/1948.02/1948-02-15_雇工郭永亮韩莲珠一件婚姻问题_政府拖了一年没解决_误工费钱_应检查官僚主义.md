[News from this newspaper] The marriage issue of Guo Yongliang, a hired laborer from Beixi Jing Village in Wu'an, and Han Lianzhu, based on the current materials, seems like it should have been easily resolved. However, the lawsuit went from the district to the county, and from the county to the Border Region Government, wasting untold work hours and spending countless amounts of money. The government has been dragging its feet for nearly a year, and it remains unresolved.

Guo Yongliang is thirty-six years old this year. He started working as a hired hand at the age of seventeen and worked for sixteen years before ceasing in 1946. His wife, Han Lianzhu, is from Dawangzhai in the Seventh District of Yuanchao, and is twenty-five years old this year. Her original husband, surnamed Yuan, was from Jingyu Village in Wu'an, and was a poor peasant. He starved to death during the famine in 1942. Within seven days, Guo Yongyuan and Guo Bingrong from Beixi Jing introduced Han Lianzhu to Guo Yongliang. At that time, the Wu'an County Government was located in Beixi Jing. Guo Yongliang and the village cadres Shen fu @① and Hao Qingkui went to the county government to complete the procedures. Section Chief Ji Zemin asked if it was voluntary on both sides, and then allowed them to marry. Shen fu @① requested that the procedures be completed. Section Chief Ji said, "No need. In times of famine, if both people are willing, who can interfere with the marriage? It's nothing." They got married on the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar that year.

	The district said they couldn't figure it out.
	The county government unjustly ruled for divorce.

On the first day of the second lunar month last year, Han Lianzhu's mother and uncle went to Beixi Jing and called Han Lianzhu back to Yuanchao. Sanmang and Xiuting also went to their mother's home together. Sanmang and Xiuting's mother's home is in Yaotou Village, Yuanchao. Han Lianzhu stayed at home for six or seven days, then went to Yaotou to invite Sanmang and Xiuting back to Wu'an. They asked her if she was homesick. Han Lianzhu said, "No, my mother said some inappropriate things that I couldn't stand." Because they hadn't finished weaving, they agreed to discuss when to leave at the Dawangzhai fair on the twenty-third day of the second lunar month. They also advised her not to listen to others, saying, "You're not being mistreated there." She said, "There are no parents-in-law to control me." When they went to invite her, she said she wouldn't go back. They asked Xicun (from Gouhe Village, Wu'an), who was visiting relatives there, to send a message to Guo Yongliang. Guo Yongliang went to Dawangzhai to call his wife on the teens of the second lunar month, but Han Lianzhu refused to return.

On the nineteenth day of the second lunar month, Guo Yongliang returned to Beixi Jing alone. On the twenty-third and fourth, he asked the village chief and political director to write a letter to file a lawsuit in Yuanchao. He first went to the Yuanchao County Government, which introduced him to the Seventh District. The district asked Han Lianzhu to return to Wu'an, but Lianzhu refused, so the district promised to detain her and educate her. At this time, the village cadre stationed by the district government (in Beizhuang) said to Guo Yongliang: "Fellow villager from Wu'an, she doesn't want to live with you anymore, she is far away from her mother. Give you some money, go back and find another one. You don't need to spend this money here (referring to spending money on lawsuits)." The villagers also said to Guo Yongliang: "She won't go back with you. She has found another family and is engaged, right in our village." Guo Yongliang asked the district, "Why was she engaged just because she went to her mother's home?" The district said "I don't know." Later, he investigated and found that Han Lianzhu's new mother-in-law was delivering food to Lianzhu, and her new husband, Nie Baocun, also went to see her, so no wonder the district didn't ask Guo Yongliang to deliver food. Guo Yongliang saw that the lawsuit was not going well and requested to go to the county government to sue. The district said: "Let's educate her more." Guo Yongliang said: "I can't afford it, I don't have much money. I have objections to the educational methods." He told about the new mother-in-law delivering food and other things. The district said: "That's not true." Later, he was still introduced to the county, and the county wrote a letter asking him to go to the district to resolve it. The district said that the marriage contract between Nie Baocun and Han Lianzhu had been terminated. Lianzhu still refused to leave. At this time, Guo Yongliang was almost out of travel expenses, so he said to the district: "I can't afford to stay here, I want to return to Wu'an and hand the person over to the government. I will come to ask for her sooner or later."

Guo Yongliang went to Yuanchao for the second time on the twenty-seventh and eighth days of the seventh lunar month, with Guo Yongyuan as a companion. He first went to Dawangzhai, but Lianzhu's family did not let him see her. The village chief said: "If you want to spend some money, just spend some money, she won't go back. It's a loss to keep running back and forth." Guo Yongliang did not listen and sued to the county. During the court session, the government personnel said: "I will definitely ask her (Lianzhu) to go with you." Just as he said this, he asked Guo Yongliang to go down. It turned out that the village cadre from Dawangzhai had arrived. After a while, the government personnel changed their tune again, saying that they wanted to improve women and ruled that Guo Yongliang and Han Lianzhu should be divorced. If he was not satisfied, he should appeal to the Linqing Commissioner's Office. Guo Yongliang was in difficulty for a long time before he came out with the judgment. He wanted to appeal to the Commissioner's Office, but he didn't have travel expenses, so he had to go home.

After returning home, Guo Yongliang said: He felt depressed. He had spent a lot of money at the beginning, and this time he spent another twenty or thirty thousand, but he didn't find out the "reason." One day, he met Guo Yushi, the deputy county chief of Wu'an (who was recuperating in Xijing), and asked him to write a letter. On the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, he filed a complaint with the Border Region Government. Wei Zetong, the chief of the social affairs section, said that he would write a letter to Yuanchao to see what was going on. After about a month, he went to the Border Region Government again, but he didn't see Chief Wei, so he made a wasted trip. Twenty or thirty days later, he found Chief Wei. Chief Wei said: "Let me send you another letter." He went to the Border Region Government for the fourth time, but there was still no result.

One day, Zhou Jifang (according to Guo Yongliang, he was a county political commissar) who was recuperating in Xijing, learned about Guo Yongliang's affairs and wrote a letter to Meng Futang, the director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, and Minister Guo (whose name he didn't know), who were meeting in ×× Village, asking Guo Yongliang to talk to them. According to Guo Yongliang: "When I arrived at ×× Village, the sentry passed the letter in and asked me to wait. When the meeting was dismissed, it was almost dark, and Director Meng left. I went to the ×× Village where he lived. I searched for a long time before I found him. He asked me what was the matter? I said, "Have you seen a letter?" He asked: "Where are you from?" I said: "Xijing, Wu'an." He asked: "Who sent the letter?" I said: "Political Commissar Zhou." He asked: "Which Political Commissar Zhou? I don't know." I said: "I don't know either." He said: "I haven't seen the letter." I said: "Can the sentry suppress our letter?" He said: "I don't know if it's suppressed. What is your business?" I said: "The lawsuit issue in Yuanchao County." He asked: "Didn't you lose?" I said: "How do you know that the lawsuit in Yuanchao County was lost if you haven't received the letter? Was the verdict in Yuanchao County your idea?" He said: "The problem in Yuanchao County still has to go back to Yuanchao County. I am here for a meeting, not to solve your problem. Go back to Jinnan to solve it." I said: "It doesn't matter if it can't be solved, it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the letter. Give me a return slip so I can go back." He said: "Can I give you a road pass when I'm in a meeting?" I said: "What should I do? Then I'll just roast by the stove all night." He said: "I don't care if you roast. We have two or three hundred people from Jinnan here, it's too crowded."

Guo Yongliang said: Director Meng of the Jinnan Administrative Office doesn't care enough about us.

According to Guo Yongliang, he was very dissatisfied that Director Meng was not concerned about him, and finally gave him a road pass. Guo Yongliang said: "When I came out, it was dark in the middle of the night, and I was walking aimlessly. I thought about it and went to the village chief. The village chief was initially unwilling to keep me. Later, he asked about my background and history, and said: "We are basically the same people, some are slow to treat." So he took me to Li Xiukui's house to lie down for a night."

On the first few days of the twelfth lunar month, Guo Yongliang went to the Border Region Government for the fifth time. Chief Wei said that he had sent a telegram to the Jinnan Administrative Office and that his problem would be dealt with in at most ten or twenty days. On January 12th of this year, Guo Yongliang went to the Border Region Government for the sixth time. Chief Wei said: "A telegram was sent but there was no reply. Let me send you another telegram."

    雇工郭永亮韩莲珠一件婚姻问题
    政府拖了一年没解决
    误工费钱·应检查官僚主义
    【本报消息】武安北西井村雇工郭永亮，和韩莲珠的婚姻问题，根据现在的材料来看，问题本来是容易解决的；可是官司从区打到县，从县打到边府，误了不知多少工，花了不知多少钱，政府拖来拖去，将近一年，始终没解决。
    郭永亮今年三十六岁，从十七岁给人家当长工，当了十六年，民国三十五年才下工。他老婆韩莲珠，元朝七区大王寨人，今年二十五岁。原夫姓袁，武安井峪村人，是贫农。三十一年闹灾荒饿死。没过七天，北西井郭永元、郭丙荣就给郭永亮介绍韩莲珠。当时武安县政府住在北西井，郭永亮和本村干部申ｆǔ＠①、郝庆魁到县府办手续。科长纪泽民问了问是两家自愿，就让他们结婚。申ｆǔ＠①要求办办手续。纪科长说：“不用。灾荒年头，两个人都愿意，谁还能干涉婚姻？没啥事。”当年旧历五月二十七日他俩结了婚。
  区上说是摸不清楚  县府平白判决离婚
    去年旧历前二月初一，韩莲珠的母亲和舅舅到北西井，叫韩莲珠回了元朝。当时一块走娘家的还有三忙和秀亭。三忙和秀亭的娘家，是元朝窑头村。韩莲珠到家住了六、七天，到窑头约三忙、秀亭回武安。她俩问她是不是想家？韩莲珠说：“不是，俺娘说了些不对头的话，我听不过。”她俩因为没织完布，约定旧历二月二十三日大王寨会上再商量什么时候走。还劝她别听人家的话，说：“你在那里又不被屈。”她说：“又没有公公婆婆管着我。”等到去约她的时候，她又说不走了。她俩就托在那里走亲戚的喜存（武安沟河村人）给郭永亮捎了个信。郭永亮就在旧历后二月十几日到大王寨叫老婆，韩莲珠说啥也不回来。
    旧历后二月十九，郭永亮一个人回到北西井。二十三、四日，找村长政治主任写了信，到元朝打官司去。先到了元朝县政府，县府介绍到七区。区上让韩莲珠回武安，莲珠说啥也不走，区上答应押起来教育她。这时，区公所住村（北庄）的村干部对郭永亮说：“武安老乡，人家不愿意跟你过日子啦，离她娘远。给你几个钱，回去另寻一个吧。你不用在这里花这个钱，（指打官司花钱）啦。”村上老百姓也对郭永亮说：“她不跟你回去啦，人家寻了婆家啦，订了婚啦，就在俺这村。”郭永亮追问区上“为啥来串娘家就给订了婚”？区上说“摸不清楚”。后来他一调查，韩莲珠新找的婆婆给莲珠送饭，新丈夫聂保存也去看她，怪不得区上不叫郭永亮送饭。郭永亮看这官司不对劲，要求到县政府去打。区上说：“再教育教育她吧。”郭永亮说：“我熬不起，盘缠少。我对教育方法有意见。”他就把新婆婆送饭等事情说了说。区上说：“没有的事。”后来还是给介绍到了县上，县上又写信叫到区上解决。区上说已经解除了聂保存和韩莲珠的婚约。莲珠还是不走。这时，郭永亮已快没了路费，就对区上说：“我在这里熬不起啦，我要回武安，把人交给政府，我早晚来要人。”
    郭永亮二回下元朝，是旧历七月二十七、八日，和郭永元带伴去的。先到了大王寨，莲珠家没叫见人。村长来说：“你要使个钱儿，就使个钱儿，人家不回去啦。来回跑，受损失。”郭永亮不听，告到了县上。过堂的时候，政府的人员说：“我一定叫她（莲珠）跟你。”刚说到这里，就叫郭永亮下去。原来大王寨的村干部来了。停了一会，政府人员又变了挂，说要提高妇女，判决郭永亮和韩莲珠离婚，要不服，就到临清专署上诉。郭永亮犯了半天难为，才拿着判决书出来。想到专署上诉，没有路费了，只好回家。
    回家以后，郭永亮说：心头闷倦，起先就花了不少钱，这回又花了两三万，也没闹出个“原因”。有一天他见了武安副县长郭雨时（在西井养病），叫他给写了一封信，旧历八月十五到边府告了一状。社会科长魏泽同说给元朝写封信看看。过了月把子，他又去边府，没见到魏科长，白跑了一趟。又过了二十多天，找到了魏科长。魏科长说：“再给你去封信吧。”第四趟去边府，还是没有结果。
    有一天，在西井休养的周继方（据郭永亮说是个县政委），知道了郭永亮的事情，就给正在××村开会的冀南行署主任孟夫唐、郭部长（不知道名字）写了封信，让郭永亮找他们谈谈。据郭永亮说：“我到了××村，站岗的把信传进去，叫我等着。散会的时候，天快黑了，孟主任走了。我又到了他住的××村。找了半天才找到他。他问我什么事？我说：“有封信你见了吗？”他问：“你是哪里的？”我说：“武安西井。”他问：“送的谁的信？”我说：“周政委的。”他问：“哪一个周政委？”我说：“周继方。”他说：“哪一个周继方？我不知道。”我说：“我也不知道。”他说：“我没有见信。”我说：“站岗的还能压咱封信？”他说：“压不压我不知道。你是什么事？”我说：“元朝县的官司问题。”他问：“你不是输了吗？”我说：“你没接到信怎么知道元朝县的官司输了？元朝县的判决是你的主意？”他说：“元朝县的问题还得回元朝县，我来这里开会来嘛，不是解决你这问题，你回冀南解决。”我说：“不能解决也没啥，信见不见也没啥，你给我开个回条我回去吧。”他说：“我开会还能给你开路条？”我说：“怎么办？我今天就在大灶上烤一黑夜吧。”他说：“你烤不烤我不管。我们冀南来了二三百号人，挤得着不下。”
  郭永亮表示：冀南行署孟主任对咱们不够关心
    据郭永亮表示，孟主任对他不够关心，他很不满意，直到最后才给他开了个路条。郭永亮说：“我出来，黑地半夜，没头走，思想了一下，找村长吧，村长开头不愿意留我。后来问了我的出身历史，说：“都是基本上人，有些慢待。”就领我到李秀魁家躺了一夜。”
    旧历十二月初几，郭永亮第五遭去边府，魏科长说是打电报给冀南行署了，顶多在宽一二十天就处理他的问题。今年一月十二日，郭永亮第六遭去边府，魏科长说：“打了个电报没来回信，再给你打个电报吧。”
