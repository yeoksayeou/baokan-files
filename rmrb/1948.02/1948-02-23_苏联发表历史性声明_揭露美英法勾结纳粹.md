Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau under the Council of Ministers has continuously published a historic statement entitled "Falsifiers of History" from the 9th to the 16th of this month. The full text, running into tens of thousands of words, rigorously refutes the so-called "Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939-41," published on January 21st by the U.S. State Department on behalf of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in order to set the record straight for the world. The statement lists Nazi German diplomatic documents seized by the Soviet army during the war against Germany, proving that British, American, and French imperialism fostered the Hitler gang before the war, resulting in an unprecedented human catastrophe. During the war, they wavered and slacked off in their efforts, using Germany to weaken the Soviet Union on the one hand, and secretly plotting a separate peace with Germany on the other, thus prolonging the war. The statement begins by stating that: "The purpose of the U.S. State Department in publishing the so-called German-Soviet documents is solely to use fabricated material to slander the Soviet Union, which is a staunch fighter for democracy and anti-aggression, in an attempt to reduce its international prestige." The statement also states: "The Soviet government opposed the publication of the seized German documents before they had been jointly verified by the four powers. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France have now arbitrarily published them, risking the great transgression of falsifying history in order to slander the Soviet Union, which bore the greatest burden in the war against Germany. The three governments must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this unilateral action." The entire statement is filled with extremely valuable and irrefutable secret facts, such as the fact that after the outbreak of the war, Britain, the United States, and France not only did not make efforts to fight against Germany, but instead planned to attack the Soviet Union. In addition to the fact that Britain and the United States instigated Finland to attack the Soviet Union, which is already known to the world, the French generals Weygand and de Gaulle even planned to attack the Soviet Union from the Caucasus. After the Soviet Union joined the war, Britain and the United States, without the consent of the Soviet Union, discussed a separate peace with Germany in Lisbon and Switzerland. The U.S. representative who negotiated with the German Prince Hohenlohe in Switzerland was none other than Dulles's brother, the notorious warmonger of today.

　　苏联发表历史性声明  揭露美英法勾结纳粹
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议情报局自本月九日起至十六日止，连续发表题为"历史的伪造者"的历史性声明。全文长达数万言，严正驳斥美国国务院代表美英法三国政府在上月二十一日发表的所谓"一九三九年至四一年间纳粹与苏联关系录。"以正世人视听。声明列举苏军在对德战争中所缴获的纳粹德国外交文件，证明英美法帝国主义在战前扶植希特勒匪党，致造成人类空前战祸，在战时又对战争动摇、怠工，一方面利用德国削弱苏联，一方面密谋对德单独媾和，因而使战争延长。声明首称：美国国务院发表所谓德苏文件的目的，仅在拿伪造的东西借以毁谤作为民主与反侵略的坚强战士的苏联，企图减低其国际威望。声明并称："苏联政府曾反对将所缴获的德国文件在经四国共同核正以前即予公布，英、美、法三国政府此次擅予公布，甘冒伪造历史之大不韪，以毁谤肩负对德作战最大任务的苏联，该三国政府须对此一片面行动的后果负全部责任。"声明全文充满极有价值而无可辩驳的秘密事实，如在战争爆发以后，英、美、法不仅不努力对德作战，反计划进攻苏联，除英美之唆使芬兰进攻苏联已为世人共知外，法国魏刚与戴高乐竟计划自高加索进攻苏联。在苏联参战以后，英美竟未得苏联同意，在里斯本及瑞士和德国商谈单独媾和。在瑞士与德王子霍亨罗谈判时的美国代表，就是今天臭名昭著的战争贩子杜勒斯的兄弟。
