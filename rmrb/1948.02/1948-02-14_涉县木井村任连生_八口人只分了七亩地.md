To the Editor:

    Ren Liansheng, a poor peasant in Mujing Village, She County, has a family of eight, including six children, the oldest only ten years old and the youngest only two months old. During the famine in the 31st year of the Republic [1942], they couldn't sustain themselves and fled to Zuoquan County. Last February, hearing that there was a movement for land reform at home, he wanted to turn things around, so he returned. After he came back, the cadres said, "You came back late, the fruits have all been divided!" and only allocated him seven mu and two fen of land. They didn't even have a house to live in, eight people with nothing, so they borrowed three dilapidated rooms from the vice chairman of the farmers' association. They had no grain at home, hoping that the harvest from the land would be good. But they encountered a bad year, and the harvested grain was not enough to eat. The entire family of six dared not eat a single thick meal, only drinking rice soup for more than a month until it was all gone. After that, he relied entirely on chopping firewood to buy some rice to sustain the family. He managed to earn enough for each day. Unfortunately, he later developed a sore on his neck and couldn't chop firewood, so the whole family was going hungry. He lay on the kang [heated brick bed] and thought about it, but couldn't find a solution. He heard that the village had a public granary, so he went to the village cadre to borrow from it. The chairman of the farmers' association said, "The procedures for the public granary haven't been sorted out yet, wait a few days!" He went seven times, but couldn't borrow anything. Just then, his wife gave birth to twins. The adults couldn't get a full meal, so how could the children have milk to drink? Eight people had two tattered quilts, no mattress, and the children had no clothes to wear, shivering and crying on the kang. His wife was also crying. As the end of the year approached, he owed more than three thousand yuan for medicine he had taken at the political director's and the demobilized soldiers' pharmacy when he was sick. They came every day to demand payment, and he couldn't pay. The bill collectors glared at him and shouted, "We are not a relief center, if you don't have money, go borrow somewhere else, you have to pay the bill anyway." He was forced into a corner. After we learned about this, we went to ask Ren Liansheng, "The pharmacy belongs to the political director, why don't you talk to the political director!" He said, "I don't dare!" Like this, day by day, the New Year was approaching. Others were butchering meat and grinding flour, but he didn't even know where to borrow the rice he used to make rice soup. One night, he discussed with his wife that he wanted to give a daughter away to someone else in exchange for a few kilograms of rice to get through the New Year. His wife couldn't bear to, so they argued all night. At dawn, his wife ran to the countryside and cried, saying, "Who is as miserable as us! Living in someone else's house, afraid of being gossiped about. Others have rice and flour for the New Year, but we can't even borrow food! I have nowhere to say the bitterness in my heart all year round, alas!" After we learned about this, we persuaded her to come back. From this incident, we can see that poor and hired peasants are selling their children for the New Year, but some rich peasants are still buying meat for the New Year and still living in good courtyards. We believe that land reform is not thorough, and the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants should be resolved quickly. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to publish this, so that not only this village should pay attention, but also all localities must check the current difficulties of the poor and hired peasants.

    涉县木井村任连生
    八口人只分了七亩地
    编辑同志：
    涉县木井村贫农任连生，家中八口人，六个小孩，最大的才十岁，最小的才满两个月。在卅一年灾荒，无法维持生活，逃荒到左权县，去年二月听说家里闹运动，他也想翻一翻身，就回来了，回来之后，干部说：“你回来的迟了，果实都分完啦！”就只分了七亩二分地。他们连住的房子都没有，光杆八口人，借农会副主席家快要倒塌的三间房子住下，家里一点粮食也没有，等盼着地里打下来就好了。可是碰了一个坏年景，打下的粮食不够吃，全家六口人不敢吃一顿稠饭，光喝米汤一个多月就喝完了。以后就全凭他打柴买一点米来维持生活，这样一天弄的还够一天吃。不幸后来他脖子上生了个疮，不能割柴了，全家人就要饿着肚子，他躺在炕上，想来想去没办法，听人说村上有义仓，于是他就找村干借义仓，农会主席说：“义仓手续没弄清，等几天再说吧！”一连找了七次一点也没有借上。正在这时，他老婆又生了两个小孩（双生），大人吃不到一顿饱饭，小孩哪里有奶吃？八口人两条破被子，褥子也没有了，小孩也没衣服穿，冻的在炕上喳喳叫，他老婆也哭。到年根了，他病时吃了政治主任和退伍军人药铺里三千多元药帐，人家每天来要，没有钱还不了帐，要帐的瞪着两只眼喊着：“我们不是救济所，没钱你去别处借，反正得还帐。”逼的他无办法。我们知道了以后去问任连生说：“药铺是政治主任的，你为什么不去和政治主任说说哩！”他说：“咱可不敢！”象这样一天一天的离过年近了，别人有的割肉，有的推面，他家连过去喝米汤的米也还不知在哪里。一天晚上他和老婆商量，他想把一个女孩给人家换几斤米过过年，老婆舍不得，于是两个人就吵了一黑夜，天一明他老婆就跑到野外数数落落的哭说着“谁有咱苦呀！住着人家房子，怕人家说闲话，人家过年有米面，咱连吃的也借不上呀！我一年心里的苦处没地方说，唉！”我们知道了以后才把她劝解回来。从这件事上看，贫雇过年卖小孩，但有些富农过年还是买肉，平常住的还是很好的院子。我们认为土地改革不彻底，贫雇困难应当迅速解决，所以写信叫贵报发表，除该村应注意外，各地也必检查贫雇眼前的困难。（行知学校学生靖玉仲、齐小慧等代笔）
