Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 1st: The Front Headquarters has issued its eighth communique announcing the battle results north of the Daqing River. The communique stated that a unit of our army north of the Daqing River continuously swept the bandit puppet Wang Fenggang's forces from the 18th to the 21st of last month, liberating the two cities of Xiong and Ba, and many important strongholds and villages such as Nanmeng, Niutuo, Mao'erwan, Wangkeqiao, Jiugang, Shakou, Banjiawo, Duliu, Chaheji, Mawutou, Gegezhuang, Longwan, Xihouliu, and Mazhuang. So far, all transportation and fortifications in the Xiongxian, Baxian, and Xinzhen areas north of the Daqing River have been destroyed. A total of the entire Second Battalion and most of the Third Battalion of Wang Fenggang's 15th Regiment, one company of the First Battalion, and all of the Second Company of the puppet police force were annihilated. More than 150 bandits and puppets, including the Deputy Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the 15th Regiment, were killed or wounded, and 521 people were captured, including the Deputy Battalion Commander of the Second Battalion, Mao Pinglin, the Company Commander Yang Kemin and others. The captured included 20 light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, 349 rifles and pistols, four grenade launchers, and many other military supplies. Wang Fenggang was originally a major Chinese traitor in Xincheng County, Hebei Province, serving as a pawn of the Japanese invaders and massacring thousands of people, whom the people hated to the bone. After the Japanese surrender, Chiang bandit incorporated him into the Seventh Security Brigade of Hebei. After Fu bandit entered Hebei, he expanded Wang bandit's two regiments into six regiments, distributing them north of the Daqing River to build fortifications. After this blow, Wang bandit's plan to control the Xiong (county), Ba (county), and Xin (cheng) areas was bankrupted.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 31st: The Front Headquarters has issued a supplementary communique stating that in the battles of Zhuangtuan and other places east of Laishui on the 13th of this month, in addition to annihilating most of the New 32nd Division and parts of the 101st Division and the Provisional 17th Division, and killing Li Mingding, the commander of the New 32nd Division, the headquarters of the Fu bandit's 35th Army was also dealt a devastating blow. The commander of the army, Lu Yinglin, was also killed while breaking through in Beiyian. Further investigation has revealed that Hao Yingwu, the Colonel of the Military Affairs Department of the army headquarters, Liu Jinru, the Colonel of the Medical Department, Li Shuzhen, the Major Operations Staff Officer, and Li Shutong, the Major Grenade Launcher Company Commander, and other officers were captured alive. Lu Yinglin was from Yuanqu, Shanxi, a student of the fifth class of the Baoding Military Academy and the second class of the Army University's special course. He had served as a brigade commander, division commander, deputy military law supervisor in the Jin army, and chief of staff of the Fu bandit's 12th War Zone, and later as commander of the bandit's 35th Army.
