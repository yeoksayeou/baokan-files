Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 24th: Berlin Dispatch: Soviet Representative Ilyarov, at the Berlin Assistant Garrison Commanders meeting on the 20th, protested the U.S. occupation authorities' prohibition of all meetings related to the People's Congress, and even the prohibition of the Zillendorf People's Congress from issuing appeals for German unification and a just peace. Ilyarov denounced these anti-democratic actions as "arbitrary police actions," and strongly criticized the U.S. military authorities for violating the Potsdam Agreement by forcibly hindering progressive people's movements. Ilyarov stated that the Soviet government resolutely protested the British and American occupation authorities for importing notorious anti-democratic measures to Berlin, and demanded the abolition of all restrictions so that Berlin residents could freely express their opinions on German unification and a just peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 24th: Berlin, February 20th Dispatch: According to the Deutsche Nachrichten, the Liaison Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party and the German Communist Party (Note: In February 1947, the two parties decided to take unified action, forming a standing committee and establishing a central bureau and liaison bureau in Berlin), has submitted a protest to the military governments of the U.S., British, and French occupation zones and the Allied Control Council, opposing a series of bans restricting the activities of the German Communist Party and the liaison bureau in the Western occupation zones, and protesting the prohibition of prominent German political leaders and certain democratic publications from entering the British occupation zone. The protest pointed out that these bans violate the democratic rights guaranteed to the people by the Potsdam Agreement.

Additionally: Following the ban on the activities of the People's Congress, a series of anti-communist and anti-democratic incidents have recently occurred in the Western occupation zones. For example, the Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia in the British occupation zone, under the orders of the British and American authorities, unreasonably removed two communist ministers from the state government and simultaneously closed down the state's communist party newspaper.

　　苏方代表斥责美军当局把反民主措施搬到柏林
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】柏林讯：苏联代表伊里亚洛夫，二十日在柏林助理卫戍司令会议上，抗议美占领当局禁止召开与人民大会有关的一切会议，甚至禁止齐兰多夫人民大会发表争取德国统一与正义和平的呼吁书。伊氏对这些反民主行动责之为“专横无理的警察行动”，并力斥美军事当局违反波茨顿决议，以武力妨害进步的人民运动。伊氏称：苏联政府断然抗议英美占领当局把臭名远扬的不民主措施搬到柏林来，并要求废除一切限制，使伯林居民能对德国统一及正义和平，自由表示意见。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】柏林二十日讯：据德意志新闻报导：统一社会党与德共的联络局（按一九四七年二月两党曾决定统一行动，合组常务委员会，并于柏林设立中央局及联络局），顷向美英法占领区之军政府及盟国管委会提出抗议书，反对箝制德共与该联络局在西占区活动之一连串禁令，并抗议禁止著名德国政治领袖与若干民主刊物进入英占区。抗议书指出：这些禁令违反波茨顿协定保证给人民的民主权利。
    又讯：西占区继禁止人民大会活动后，最近又发生一连串反共反民主事件。例如英占区北莱因——威斯特发利亚州总理，在英美当局命令下无理撤换了该州政府中二个共产党部长，同时封闭了该州共产党的机关报。
