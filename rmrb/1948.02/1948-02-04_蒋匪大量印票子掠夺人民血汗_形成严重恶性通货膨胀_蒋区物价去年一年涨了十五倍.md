Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd. A synthesis of news from newspapers and magazines in the Chiang-controlled areas: By the end of last year, the total amount of paper money issued by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had exceeded 100 trillion yuan, forming a severe hyperinflation, and exposing a true intention behind the Chiang bandits' recent clamor for "currency reform," which is to attempt to continue squeezing the blood and sweat of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas with new scams at a time of desperation. The Chiang bandit authorities have always been secretive about the amount of their paper money issuance. Earlier this year, Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Chiang government, unexpectedly announced that the total amount was 25 trillion yuan, but economists in the Chiang-controlled areas generally believe that this figure is false and its purpose is to cover up the truth about the Chiang bandits' hyperinflation. A professor of economics at Peking University pointed out in an article in the Tianjin "Minguo Daily," a Chiang Party newspaper, on New Year's Day this year, that the amount of Chiang currency issued at the end of 1946 was 10 trillion yuan, and that it increased to 16 trillion yuan in the first three months of last year. According to conservative estimates, the amount issued at the end of last year should be 70 to 80 trillion yuan, and this does not include the 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 yuan banknotes issued from December 10th of last year. According to a Shanghai dispatch in a Beijing magazine, the author collected various versions and colors of Chiang currency below 10,000 yuan on the market at the end of November and statistically analyzed the ticket numbers. At that time, the total amount of Chiang currency issued had reached about 150 trillion yuan. In order to rush to print paper money to supply its huge fiscal expenditures, the Chiang bandit clique, in addition to the Chiang-controlled "Central Printing Plant" and its branches, the Zhonghua Book Company, the China Daye Printing Company and other companies stepped up printing, and also placed large orders with the British De La Rue and the American printing companies. Even the semi-official Chiang bandit newspaper, the Beijing "Jingshi Daily," exclaimed: It is expected that banknotes with large denominations of one million and two million yuan will appear in 1948.

Due to the malignant expansion of the Chiang currency, prices in the Chiang-controlled areas, taking Shanghai as an example, were 145,000 times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War in December last year, but when Japan surrendered in 1945, the Shanghai price index was only 1,100 times higher than before the war. Prices in Peiping were even higher, rising to 180,000 times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War in mid-December. The rise in prices in the Chiang-controlled areas has been increasing more rapidly year by year. In the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, the annual increase was less than 50 percent. From 1941 to 1945, when Japan surrendered, the annual increase was only three to three and a half times. In 1946, the price increase was about five times, but last year it increased sharply to twelve to fifteen times in one year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd. Shanghai newspapers revealed: The four major family banks use the privilege of unlimited issuance of banknotes as a tool to plunder the people's blood and sweat. This is the secret of why the Chiang bandit gang adopted a policy of inflation. The Chiang, Kong, and Political Science clique's "Central Bank" enjoys the exclusive power to issue Chiang currency. It can directly issue Chiang currency in addition to the Chiang government's fiscal payments, engage in speculation and monopoly activities, and can conduct "re-mortgages" with various commercial firms. The firms are nominally required to pay 70% of the collateral, but in fact, they do not need to pay it to receive the money, so in fact, it is equivalent to the firms doing 30% and the Central Bank doing 70%. In addition to the Central Bank, the Song family's Bank of China, the Chiang family and Chen family's Farmers Bank, the Political Science clique and Chen family's Bank of Communications, the "Central Bank" subsidiary, the Central Trust Bureau, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Chen family's Central Cooperative Treasury and other six banks and bureaus also obtained benefits from the spoils. They can all "re-mortgage" to the Central Bank, and can also borrow money from the Central Bank at any time under the pretext of "poor turnover" to engage in commercial speculation and financial activities, and the amount is "almost unlimited." As for the Central Bank's so-called deposits, they are actually the Chiang bandit government's "public funds," most of which are newly issued Chiang currency. Therefore, the six banks and bureaus "re-mortgaging" or "borrowing" from it is actually equivalent to issuing new banknotes in advance, or increasing the circulation rate of so-called "public funds" or new banknotes. A large part of the huge blood and sweat lost by the people in the Chiang-controlled areas in the accelerated rise in prices has therefore fallen into the private pockets of the four major families.

    蒋匪大量印票子掠夺人民血汗
    形成严重恶性通货膨胀
    蒋区物价去年一年涨了十五倍
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合蒋区报章杂志消息：截至去年年底止，蒋匪纸币发行总额，已超过一百万亿元，形成严重的恶性通货膨胀，并暴露出蒋匪最近喧嚷“货币改革”的一个真正意图，即是企图于山穷水尽之时，以新骗术来继续压榨蒋区人民的血汗。蒋匪当局对其纸币发行数额一向讳莫如深，年前蒋政府财政部次长徐柏园忽破例宣布该项总数为二十五万亿元，但蒋区一般经济学家都认为这个数字是假的，其目的是企图掩盖蒋匪恶性通货膨胀的真相。北大一经济系教授今年元旦在蒋党报纸天津民国日报著文指出，一九四六年底蒋币发行数为十万亿元，去年头三个月即增至十六万亿元，据保守的估计，去年底的发行额应为七十万亿到八十万亿元，而年前十二月十日起发行的二万、四万、十万元大钞尚未计算在内。另据北平一杂志载上海通讯，作者在年前十一月底曾收集市面万元以下各种版样、颜色不同之蒋币，并对其票面号码加以统计，发现当时蒋币发行总额已约达一百五十万亿元之巨。蒋匪为了赶印纸币供其庞大的财政开支，除由蒋记“中央印刷厂”及其各分厂、中华书局、中国大业印刷公司等加紧印制之外，并向英国德罗尼及美国印钞公司大量订制。连蒋匪半官方报纸北平经世日报亦惊呼：预料一九四八年内将有一百万及二百万元之大面额钞票出现。
    由于蒋币恶性膨胀，蒋区物价以上海为例，年前十二月已为抗战前的十四万五千倍，但一九四五年日本投降时，上海物价指数尚仅为战前的一千一百倍。北平物价则更高，十二月中旬已上涨为抗战前的十八万倍。蒋区物价的上涨，一年比一年涨得猛，抗战初期每年上涨不及百分之五十，一九四一年至一九四五年日本投降时，每年上涨亦仅三倍至三倍半，一九四六年物价上涨约为五倍，但去年则骤增为一年内上涨十二倍到十五倍。
    【新华社陕北二日电】沪报透露：四大家族银行利用无限度发行钞票特权，作其掠夺人民血汗的工具，这就是蒋匪帮所以采取通货膨胀政策的秘密。蒋、孔及政学系的“中央银行”，享有发行蒋币独占权力，可以直接在蒋政府财政支付之外增发蒋币，从事投机及垄断活动，并可对各商业行庄进行“转抵押”，承放行庄名义上须缴七成押金，但实际并不缴纳即可领款，故实际上等于承放行庄做三成，央行做七成。除中央银行外，宋家的中国银行，蒋家与陈家的农民银行，政学系与陈家之交通银行，“中央银行”子公司中央信托局、邮政储金汇业局及陈家的中央合作金库等六行局库，亦获得分赃利益，它们都可以向中央银行“转抵押”，随时还可以借口“周转不灵”向中央银行“拆款”，以从事商业投机及金融活动，而其数额是“几乎没有限度的”。至于中央银行的所谓存款，实际上就是蒋匪政府的“公款”，其中绝大部分即是新发行的蒋币，因此六行局库向它“转抵押”或“拆款”，实际上等于提前发行新钞，或增加所谓“公款”或新钞的流通速率。蒋区人民在物价加速飞涨中所损失的巨大血汗，很大一部分即因此落入四大家族的私囊。
