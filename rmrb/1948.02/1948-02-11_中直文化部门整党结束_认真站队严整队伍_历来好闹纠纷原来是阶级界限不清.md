[This news dispatch] Central Bureau-affiliated cultural work units, including the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Cultural Work Troupe, Xinhua Bookstore, People's Daily, and Xinhua General Branch and sub-branches (excluding Handan Broadcasting Station, which has not yet concluded), have now completed the initial alignment of ranks after two months of rectification. A total of 450 people participated, with landlords, rich peasants, and bourgeois elements accounting for over 80%. Regardless of class background or ideological composition, they exhibited extreme impurity.

This cultural sector alignment was conducted under the guidance of the spirit of the Land Conference in the entire region, experiencing a severely painful struggle to cut off the tail. Initially, many people believed that land reform had no direct connection to them. Some had families in the KMT-controlled areas and appeared to have no concerns on the surface. Some had remained indifferent to land reform for the past year, adopting a so-called "objective" attitude. A portion of journalists engaged in reporting practical work held a "good enough" mentality, feeling that the reporting over the past year had been pretty good, and "reviewing is for the comrades below." All of the above ideas became burdens during the study, and initially everyone was watching, observing how others were rectifying. After the proposal to rectify the Party ranks in the cultural sector, many comrades picked up the "May Fourth Directive," complaining that they hadn't studied it properly in the past, while dogmatically debating "what is a rich peasant" and "why isn't land nationalization being implemented now?" Some comrades displayed utter leftist empty talk, thinking that "as early as 1942, they felt the policy was somewhat rightist," and even felt that today's thorough equal distribution policy was not satisfying enough, and that implementing land nationalization would be considered "correct." Some comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds began to consider personal family matters, such as how to handle their landlord wives, etc. Some couldn't lift their heads, and their ideological situation began to shift from static to chaotic.

In mid-November, leading comrades called on everyone in the cultural sector, without exception, to get into the water, expressing the Party's utmost determination to rectify the ranks and transform the cultural sector to adapt to thorough equal distribution, pointing out the characteristics of the cultural sector's rank rectification, which should start with ideologically demarcating class boundaries and gradually shedding burdens. Then, the study attitude was examined, and the group automatically stipulated study discipline, sweeping away the cultural figures' free and undisciplined habits.

Through group-based fragmentary self-reflection, some people discovered that what they had previously thought was "no attitude" or "no thought" towards land reform was actually "having an attitude" and "having thoughts." For example, the report on Zhai Shixian's land donation, from a motive perspective, was to publish a beautiful news item, but in reality, it poured cold water on the struggle of the peasants in Boyan and supported the landlords. Some music workers held their cellos every day, infatuated with Beethoven and other classical masterpieces, completely neglecting to play and sing for the peasants and for land reform, instead using the excuse that they couldn't go to the countryside with their cellos to escape reality. A worker who introduced natural science knowledge thought that natural science had no class nature. In one place, landlords used the sun turning red to spread rumors of "a bloody disaster in the liberated areas." When the peasants asked him to refute it, he used scientific principles of light and heat to give a dogmatic explanation, completely failing to stand on the side of the peasants to fight. Unable to stand the peasants' struggle, he quietly hid behind scientific knowledge, concealing his face of sympathy for the landlords. Some painting and woodcut workers believed that their works were intended to be exhibited abroad, not for the peasants to see. Therefore, their works were not based on the peasants' preferences. Both politically and technically, they catered to the standards of the foreign bourgeoisie, or prepared to "be remembered for generations" in Shanghai and Peiping. Writers feared eating the people's food, considering it a hardship, feeling that there was no way to cooperate with the peasants' struggle, requesting the Party to give them three to seven years of sufficient time and abundant material treatment before they could talk about producing "works," and that even if these works were not appreciated by this generation, they could be left to future generations. After these thoughts were unearthed, most comrades realized that the ranks were impure and began to be honest, but then became entangled in the hat of petty-bourgeois ideology, thinking that petty-bourgeois ideology was less sinful than landlord ideology. There was no ideological exchange, and therefore they dared not truly stand on the class position to recognize the class roots of their mistakes, further excavating their errors, and the ideological movement became deadlocked.

After the leading comrades called for "clarifying class nature" from personal words and deeds, the movement moved forward, forming a systematic examination of work and a systematic personal reflection.

The errors and weaknesses exposed in the work inspection surprised everyone. From the lines of the newspaper and the hidden thoughts of individuals, years of unthoroughly liquidated surrenderism to big landlords and big bourgeoisie and to landlords were unearthed. For example, in the early stages of land reform, without the approval of the Central Bureau, one-sided and simple advocacy of land donation news was carried out. In the early days of the patriotic self-defense war, surrenderist thinking of uniting landlords against Chiang occurred again. In the past year, whenever a movement came to an end, the newspaper would show complacency and a "good enough" mentality, affecting the in-depth development of the movement. The second was the rush-ahead and know-it-all style: news became a "treasure chest," you want anything, I have anything, developing speculative thinking. During the war, war reports were rushed out regardless of military needs. Immersing oneself in nationwide external publicity, not being ashamed of the know-it-all style but taking pride in it. Two or three villages in Jinnan being re-examined could be written as "re-examination sweeps through Jinnan," and the liquidation by peasants in several villages in Jin-Lu-Yu could be written as "500,000 people are drawn into the struggle." The worst kind of know-it-all is closely combined with landlord and rich peasant thinking. One editor, reflecting on his use of the know-it-all method to handle an article that actually praised the landlord, was, in the depths of his mind, being directed by his landlord grandfather. Another gain from the newspaper inspection was the systematic exposure of the bourgeois influence on the work of the supplement, only wanting to show off the bourgeoisie's "cultural level," frightening the "country bumpkin" prisoners, not serving land reform. For example, connecting with the masses was learned from an old novelist's method of "giving the masses whatever they want," and as a result, many were thinking of ways for the landlords. A landlord element who had not bowed to the peasants asked: "Can individuals make progress?" The supplement editor did not sternly make him bow to the peasants to atone for his sins, but instead allowed the landlord to take advantage of the loophole. As for the manuscript about whether a son sold in poverty during a famine year could be brought back, it was inexcusably suppressed.

Xinhua Bookstore, as the Party and people's publishing organ, did not serve land reform for a long time. They believed that enterprise and the completion of political tasks were opposed, thus forming a purely business-oriented viewpoint, even unconsciously selling some toxic books published in the KMT-controlled areas. According to their review, they only began to realize the need to consciously cooperate with land reform during the Three Check-ups. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles criticized the bourgeois literary viewpoint, the most important point being not facing reality, not treating literature as a powerful weapon for the struggle of the people in the liberated areas. One comrade put on the airs of an old writer, reaching out everywhere, wanting care and status. He resisted to the end during this Party rectification study, and was severely criticized by everyone, educating everyone: only old writers who are dedicated to the people's cause and infinitely loyal to the Party are valuable; all careerists are bound to fail. Why hasn't land reform produced good works in a year? The correct answer was also found this time. Many comrades were reluctant to share weal and woe with the peasants, writing works needed for their struggle, fantasizing about great works, and haggling over personal gains and losses. The Cultural Work Troupe criticized the supremacy of art and surrenderism. Every comrade found that their disregard for politics, the supremacy of technique, and expert thinking had caused great losses to the Party's cultural work. Most comrades found that they had been in the Party for many years, never consciously working as a hired hand for the people, and felt very heavy-hearted, determined to correct their mistakes. Many comrades wept bitterly, unable to sleep, reflecting all night.

Work Inspection Exposes Errors, Self-criticism Gradually Deepens

The inspection exposed the severity of the various shortcomings in the work, and even the most dishonest people were speechless. On this basis, it was relatively smooth to dig out the roots of the class and seek the historical ideological roots of consistently making mistakes. Generally, it can be divided into the following ideological types:

The first is the "sense of justice" of the landlord-gentry class, unable to stand the struggle against landlords, considering it "personal humiliation," believing that revolution is a road, a burden, and that landlords can also walk and bear it without changing their stance. He does not let landlord youths betray their class, but instead fantasizes about them bringing glory to their class and letting out a sigh of relief to prove that they can be revolutionary. During the Party rectification, he also believed that impurity within the Party was not manifested in landlord and rich peasant thinking, but in some people only knowing how to follow the leaders in a chaotic manner, which he believed was a peasant habit that should be eliminated. This kind of person appears to be an enlightened landlord on the surface, thinking he has "cleanliness fetish," sometimes deliberately appearing fair, verbally supporting land reform, but in reality, not only is he passively working, but he also resists everywhere in his work. Some took advantage of the know-it-all style to describe their family's land donation as very revolutionary. Some didn't teach to transform landlord youths, but instead specialized in finding smart and handsome people among the landlords, cherishing them doubly, and having aversion and rejection towards peasant children. Some associated their own parents with the struggle against landlords, thus affecting their work mood.

The second is a strong bourgeois concept and consciousness, considering themselves "city sons," unfamiliar with the countryside (actually willingly acting as a bourgeois son resisting land reform). Their view of the city and the countryside is not to regard the countryside as the starting point and advancing base of revolution and revolutionary art, but rather "my loudspeaker cannot be used now, but when I get to Shanghai in the future, I can compare with the Municipal Council Orchestra," as if not doing so would make the liberated area seem too countrified? This kind of person is in the countryside but their heart is in the city. They are constantly thinking about "returning to the city in silk clothes" to compete with the bourgeoisie: "You have it, I have it too." Their view of the relationship between art and politics is not that art should serve politics, serve the peasant's emancipation through land reform, but rather "the peasant's emancipation has nothing to do with me. If you are emancipated, I will paint you happy. If you are not emancipated, I will paint you oppressed." He considers art to be free from all control, but what he actually shows is pure surrenderism. For example, some comrades in the Cultural Work Troupe, when working at ×××, changed the songs supporting Chairman Mao to songs supporting ×××, even considering it a "legal struggle." In terms of improving and popularizing: he does not improve people's art on the basis of what the peasants like to see and hear, but emphasizes "learning technology." This enthusiasm for learning technology is because he is afraid of "being eliminated when he enters the big city." He believes that "not improving is tailism" (bourgeois tailism), so he works hard every day to catch up with the bourgeoisie. This utter surrenderist thought is dominated by a wrong viewpoint, which is that "the people's art of the liberated area is not as good as the bourgeois things outside," and "the liberated area will not produce good art," thus giving rise to the thinking of keeping up with the bourgeoisie.

The third is the combination of petty-bourgeois thought and landlord-rich peasant thought: This reflection found that "becoming famous thinking" is prevalent among cultural workers. Not serving the people, but everything is for expressing oneself. This is a major source of individualism, impatience, rushing ahead, and a know-it-all style. For example, the liberation area's emancipated peasants joining the army is such a magnificent scene, with so many moving heroic deeds, but he ignores it, instead thinking of reporting on their participation in the war from those few landlords who have not completely surrendered to the peasants and are not so enthusiastic about the people's war. He praised landlords in the newspaper several times, such as praising Yang Geda for his meritorious service in carrying a stretcher, and praising Liaocheng landlords for participating in the war. When producing, he did not write about the efforts of the emancipated peasants in cultivating their own land, but also praised those landlords who were not in high spirits for production at the time. The new atmosphere in Shengfotang, Weixian County, was not a scene of emancipated peasants, but a description of landlords eating white flour and living a good life every day. Reporting on "cultivating three acres and having one acre left over" every day, but forgetting that the poor and hired laborers are still living a miserable life. This kind of petty-bourgeois thinking completely proceeds from personal plans. In order to show off and cater to people's curiosity, it produced the low-level sensationalism of "man bites dog." They believed that peasants' production and participation in the war were not surprising, and that landlords' production and participation in the war were new.

The Combination of Petty-Bourgeois Thought and Landlord-Rich Peasant Thought is Most Harmful

There are also some newly arrived urban intellectuals who consider themselves revolutionaries, but when they saw the landlords fleeing from northern Jiangsu in Nanjing, they became suspicious of the Party, so they came to the liberated area with an attitude of investigation, watching the mass struggle coldly from the sidelines, the more they watched, the more excessive it became, the more they watched, the more disappointed they became. They believed this was "objectivism" thinking. Comrades with this kind of thinking are actually not objective. Some of them shed a few tears of sympathy for the landlords in the peasant struggle, and others resisted showing the great people's power in land reform, saying "I can't see it." Facts have proved that all that they could see were things that took care of the landlords and praised the landlords.

The fourth is the landlord elements who sneaked in. One landlord in the Cultural Work Troupe felt that he had suffered a loss from paying public grain, so he mixed into the revolutionary ranks in order to "eat back a portion" to "make up for his losses" (actually to sabotage). Some wrote lists of scores to be settled and hid themselves when coming to the revolutionary camp. These people all exposed their true colors in the movement.

In addition, there are hooligan speculative thinking, degeneration thinking, etc., which will not be listed in detail. It must be pointed out that this kind of class examination is still the first time in various cultural departments in the border area. Everyone gradually learned to use the weapon of class nature to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism. In the examination, efforts were made to oppose the petty-bourgeois sentimentality, tactics, and the inferiority of fearing and evading struggle. At the same time, it advocated building a new self and opposing left-leaning one-sided exaggeration. The movement moved forward smoothly.

Under the full ideological movement, the question of checking class and checking work style was raised. Everyone drew a picture of their own class and looked in the mirror with documents such as Anti-Liberalism. In checking the class, everyone suddenly realized that the root of evil was that they had not truly betrayed their original class. One comrade who had been a revolutionary for ten years still followed his father's parting instructions to follow the Party, and a comrade from a landlord family who collected 3,000 piculs of rent still felt that his parents were also "oppressed." Everyone compared some viewpoints brought from the original class with some erroneous thoughts in the revolutionary camp, and truly found the old root. In checking the work style, everyone further found the root cause of the long-term disputes, long-term inconsistency with the leadership, and the failure to implement the policy, and found that liberalism, reconciliationism, and sectarianism had become the refuge of the old class thinking. It took advantage of loopholes such as "taking care," "democracy," and "preferential treatment for cultural figures," causing all kinds of unprincipled disputes and hindering the Party and comrades from considering work improvement from the class more. In the past, the newspaper office, which was always considered to have a relatively sound organization, cleared up the anti-Party and anti-leadership caused by personal fame and status, and caused extreme sectarianism and liberalism. One veteran comrade who had been in the Party for more than 20 years, with the help of everyone and personal reflection, found that his exploitative consciousness brought from his landlord family had basically not changed, and he had been causing trouble over fame and status for a long time, sowing discord within the Party, and carrying out sectarian activities. It caused discord between superiors and subordinates, affected Party unity, and carried out serious anti-Party and anti-leadership activities. As a result, during the year of vigorous land reform, the Party's policy could not be well implemented.

Ideological struggle developed to a climax. Comrades who made mistakes expressed deep repentance, determined to reform, and asked the Party to give them strict punishment as a supervision of future actions. The result of this organizational rectification: a total of 31 people were punished; Du Shijia and 4 others were expelled, and 3 landlord elements who did not change their ways were cleaned up (one of whom was a big tyrant).

At the end of the cultural sector's rank rectification, the leading comrade pointed out: This study is only the beginning of our further transformation. We must fully recognize the tenacity of petty-bourgeois thinking. The achievements of this study are still extremely unconsolidated. Recalling the 1942 rectification movement, it did achieve considerable results at the time. However, before long, some people took advantage of loopholes such as "unifying thinking," "taking care," and "democracy," causing more serious liberalism and sectarianism. This lesson must be deeply remembered. In the future, we must carry forward criticism and self-criticism, strictly adhere to organizational life, and in the future, we must rectify regularly, constantly rectify, wash our faces every day, go deep into the masses, and seek better training and transformation.

New Atmosphere After Going to the Countryside, Continue to Transform in the Struggle

Now, in addition to leaving twice the number of comrades to persist in their posts, nearly 300 people have carried their luggage on their backs and gone to rural areas in Taihang, Jinnan, and Jin-Lu-Yu with working groups to participate in the reorganization of the ranks and the thorough equal distribution. More than half a month of experience has proved that every comrade has undergone a more significant transformation. They are not afraid of hardship and cold, and live with the poor and hired laborers. One young lady who had just come from the KMT-controlled area and had been spoiled since childhood lived with the peasants this time and felt that she had to "grit her teeth and train." The class feelings and lifestyles of most comrades have undergone preliminary changes, and their emotions are high. They are unwilling to stop the investigation work even when the masses celebrate the New Year. Everyone is determined to let the people make an appraisal of them in the struggle.

    中直文化部门整党结束
    认真站队严整队伍
    历来好闹纠纷原来是阶级界限不清
    初步反省，发现不纯，低下头来
    【本报消息】中央局直属各文化工作单位：边区文联，文工团，新华书店，人民日报及新华总分社等机关（缺邯郸广播电台，现尚未结束），经过两个月的整顿队伍，现在初步站队完毕。此次参加人共四百五十名，地主富农及资产阶级成份占百分之八十以上，无论阶级成份，思想成份均表现了十分的不纯洁。
    这一次文化界站队，是在全区土地会议精神引导下进行的，经历了严重的痛苦的割尾巴斗争。开始的时候，不少人认为土地改革与自己没有直接关连，有的家在蒋管区，表面看来并无牵挂。有的一年来对土地改革可以说是不闻不问，抱着所谓“客观”的态度，一部分从事报导实际工作的新闻工作者则抱着“差不多”思想，觉得一年来报导得都还不错，“检讨是下边同志的事”，自己是来学习锻炼。以上种种思想在学习中成了包袱，起初都是观望，看着人家整。提出整顿文化界党的队伍后，不少同志拿上“五四指示”，一面抱怨过去没好好研究，一面教条主义的争论一阵“什么是富农”，“为什么现在不实行土地国有”？其中有的同志表现了十足的左倾空谈，自以为“早在四二年就觉得政策有些右”，甚至觉得今天彻底平分政策不过瘾，实行土地国有才算“正确”。一些地主富农出身的同志则开始考虑个人家庭、地主老婆应如何处理等问题，有些抬不起头来，思想情况开始从静止转入混乱。
    十一月中旬，领导同志号召文化界每一个人毫无例外的下水，表明党整顿队伍改造文化界适应彻底平分的最大决心，指出文化界整顿队伍的特点，要从思想上划清阶级界限入手，逐步卸下包袱。接着检查学习态度，小组自动规定了学习纪律，一扫文化人自由散漫的习气。
    经过小组片段反省，有些人发现过去自以为对土地改革“没态度”、“没思想”，实际上是“有态度”、“有思想”，象翟士贤献田的报导，从动机上看是为了发一条漂亮新闻，实际上却给伯延农民斗争泼了冷水，替地主撑了腰。有的音乐工作者天天抱着大提琴迷恋裴多汶等古典名曲，根本不去为农民为土地改革而弹唱，反而借口带上大提琴不能下乡来逃避现实。一位介绍自然科学知识的工作者自以为自然科学没有阶级性，有个地方，地主利用太阳发红造谣“解放区有血光之灾”，农民叫他驳斥，他却用光和热的科学原理作了教条解答，根本不站在农民方面进行战斗。他看不惯农民斗争，便悄悄隐蔽在科学常识背后，掩住自己对地主同情的面孔。有的绘画木刻工作者认为他的作品是要争取拿到外国去展览，不是给农民看的，因而他的作品不以农民喜爱为标准；无论是政治上与技巧上都是去迎合外国资产阶级水准，或是准备拿到上海北平去“流芳百世”。文学家怕吃老百姓的饭，引以为苦，觉得没办法配合农民斗争，要求党给以三年七年的充分时间，丰富的物质待遇，才能谈得上产生“作品”，而这种作品即使这一代不能为人赏识，却可以留给后代儿孙。这些思想挖出后，大部分同志才认识队伍不纯，开始老实了，但又纠缠在小资产阶级思想这顶帽子上，以为小资产阶级思想总比地主思想罪过轻些，思想上互不交锋，因而也就不敢真正站在阶级立场去认识错误的阶级根源，进一步发掘错误，思想运动呈现胶着状态。
    领导同志号召从个人所言所行中“明确阶级性”后，运动向前发展一步，形成工作上系统的检查和个人的系统反省。
    工作检查中暴露的错误和弱点使大家都吃了一惊。报纸方面从字里行间以及个人隐蔽思想中，挖出了几年未得到彻底清算的对大地主大资产阶级和对地主的投降主义，譬如土地改革初期未经中央局批准，即片面的单纯的鼓吹献田新闻。爱国自卫战争初期又发生了联合地主反蒋的投降主义思想。一年来每逢运动告一段落，报纸上便出现了自满情绪和差不多思想，影响运动走向深入。其次则为抢先和客里空作风：新闻成了“百宝囊”，你要什么，我有什么，发展了投机思想。战争时又不顾军事需要抢发战报。沉醉于全国性的对外宣传，对客里空作风不以为耻反以为荣。冀南二三个村复查就可以写成“冀南各地掀起复查”，冀鲁豫几个村庄的农民清算便可以写成“五十万人卷入斗争”。最坏的一种客里空是同地主、富农思想密切结合在一起，一位编辑同志反省他以客里空的手法，处理一篇实际上表扬了地主的稿件时，在思想深处，是被他的地主祖父指挥着的。报纸检查另一个收获，是系统的暴露了副刊工作上的资产阶级影响，只想卖弄资产阶级的“文化水”，吓唬俘虏“土豹子”，不去服务土地改革。譬如连系群众，却是从一个旧小说家那里学来的“群众要啥给啥”的办法，结果不少是替地主想了办法。一个没有向农民低头的地主分子询问：“个人能不能进步”？副刊编者没有严正的让他向农民低头赎罪，结果反而让地主钻了空子。至于灾荒年赤贫卖出的儿子能否领回的稿子，却被不可容恕的积压下了。
    新华书店是党和人民的出版机关，很长时却没有服务土地改革，他们认为企业化和完成政治任务有对立，于是形成了单纯营业观点，甚至不自觉的贩卖了一些蒋管区出的有毒素的书籍。据他们检讨，真正有意识的配合土地改革还只是在三查才开始意识到。文联批判了资产阶级文学观点，最主要的一点是不面向现实，不把文学当作解放区农村人民斗争的一个有力武器。有位同志摆上老作家的牌子到处伸手，要照顾、要地位，这次整党学习中一直抵抗到底，受到大家严正批判，教育了大家：只有致力于人民事业，对党无限忠心的老作家才是可贵的，一切野心家都必然要失败。为什么一年土地改革产生不出好作品？这次也找到了正确的回答，不少同志留恋于机关的小家庭的享受，不愿同农民共甘苦，写他们斗争所需要的作品，幻想大作品，斤斤计较个人得失。文工团批判艺术至上主义、投降主义，每个同志都从工作中发现了自己的忽视政治，技巧至上，专家思想等错误思想给党的文化工作带来极大损失，大多数同志发现自己入党多年，从未有意识的当人民长工，心情十分沉重，决心痛改前非。不少同志痛哭流涕，睡不着觉，整夜反省。
  工作检查暴露错误自我批判逐步深入
    检查暴露了各种工作缺点的严重性，连最不老实的人也哑口无言了。在这一基础上，比较顺利地进行挖阶级的根子，寻求一贯犯错误的历史思想根源。大体上可以分成下列几种思想类型：
    第一种是地主士大夫阶级的“正义感”，看不惯斗争地主，认为是“人格污辱”，认为革命是一条路，一付担子，地主不改变自己的立场也可以走也可以担。他不是让地主青年叛变自己阶级，反而是幻想他们为自己阶级争光，出口气，以证明自己可以革命。在整党中，还认为党内不纯不表现在地富思想，而是有些人只会跟着上级乱哄哄，他认为这是农民习气应该消除。这种人表面上象个开明地主，认为自己有“洁癖”，有时故意显得自己公正，口头上是拥护土地改革，实际上在工作中不但是消极的工作，而且处处表现抵抗。有的钻了客里空的空子，把自己家里献田描写得十分革命。有的教书不是改造地主青年，而是专在地主中找聪明俊秀的人，倍加爱惜，对农民子弟则有厌恶排斥情绪。有的看到斗争地主便联想到自己的父母，因而影响了工作情绪。
    第二种是浓厚的资产阶级观念意识，自以为是“城市儿子”，对农村不熟悉（实际上是甘当资产阶级儿子抵抗土地改革）。他们对城市和乡村的看法，不是把农村当作革命和革命艺术的出发点、前进阵地，而是“我的大喇叭现在不能用，将来到了上海还可以和工部局乐队看齐”，似乎不这样岂不显得解放区有点太土豹子了吗？这种人身在农村心在城市，他们天天念念不忘的是“衣锦进城”去和资产阶级比赛：“你有我也有”。他们对艺术与政治关系的看法，不是艺术服从政治，服从土地改革农民翻身，而是“农民翻身与我无干，你翻身我就画你高兴，你不翻身我就画你受压迫”。他自以为艺术是可以不受一切支配，实际上表现出来的却是道地的投降主义。譬如文工团有些同志在×××处工作时把拥护毛主席的歌子换成拥护×××来唱，还认为是“合法斗争”。在提高与普及上：他不是在农民喜闻乐见的基础上来提高人民艺术，而是强调“学习技术”，这种学习技术的热忱，是因为怕“进了大城市会被淘汰”。他认为“不提高就是尾巴主义”（资产阶级的尾巴主义），于是天天努力于向资产阶级迎头赶上。这种十足的投降主义思想，有一个错误观点支配着，这就是“解放区的人民艺术比不上外边资产阶级的东西”，“解放区不会出产好的艺术”，因而发生了向资产阶级看齐思想。
    第三种是小资产思想与地富思想的结合：这次反省发现文化工作者中普遍地存在着“成名思想”。不是为人民服务，而是一切为了表现自己。这是个人主义、急性病、抢先、客里空作风的一个主要来源。譬如解放区翻身农民参战，是多么雄伟壮观的场面，有着多少可歌可泣的英雄事迹，然而他却不理睬，反而从那些并没有完全向农民屈服，对人民战争并没有那样热情的少数地主身上，想出了报导他们参战的题材。在报上几次表扬地主，如表扬杨圪旦抬担架立功，表扬聊城地主参战。生产的时候不写翻身农民在自己的土地上的努力耕作，也同样表扬那些事实上在当时生产情绪并不高的地主。写威县圣佛堂新气象不是翻身农民的景象，而是描写地主天天吃白面过好生活。天天报导耕三余一，却忘记了贫雇仍在过着悲惨生活。这种小资产阶级思想完全从个人打算出发，为了出风头，迎合人们好奇心，便产生了“人咬狗”的低级趣味主义，他们认为农民生产参战不足为奇，地主生产参战才是新鲜的。
  小资产阶级思想同地主富农思想结合危害最大
    也有些新来的城市知识分子，自以为是革命家，可是在南京看到苏北逃亡地主就对党有了怀疑，于是抱着考查的态度来解放区，在一旁冷眼看群众斗争，越看越过火，越看越失望。他们认为这是“客观主义”思想。有这样思想的同志其实并不客观的，其中有的在农民斗争中给地主撒下了几滴同情之泪，还有的抵抗表现土地改革中伟大的人民力量，说是“看不见”。事实证明了凡是被他们看得见的都是照顾地主，表扬地主的东西。
    第四种则为混进来的地主分子，文工团有一个地主是因缴公粮认为吃了亏，混到革命队伍中，为了“吃回一份”来“捞本”的（实际上是破坏），有的写了变天帐来到革命阵营中隐藏了自己。这些人均在运动中暴露了自己的真面目。
    此外还有流氓投机思想、蜕化思想等都不细举。必须指出这样的从阶级检查在边区各个文化部门还是第一次，大家逐渐学会运用阶级性的武器进行自我批判和相互批判。在检查中着力反对小资产阶级的温情主义，要手法，畏惧逃避斗争等劣根性，同时提倡建设新我，反对左倾片面的夸大狂，运动一往直前顺利发展。
    在思想运动饱满情况下，提出了查阶级查作风，每个人都给自己画了一个阶级的像，拿反自由主义等文件照了照镜子。在查阶级中大家才恍然大悟原来孽根就是自己没有真正叛变自己的原阶级。一位同志革命十年仍然遵循父亲临别的嘱托来跟党闹，一位出身收三千石租子的地主家庭的同志还认为自己父母也受人“压迫”，大家把原阶级带来的一些观点和在革命阵营中一些错误思想加以对照，真正找到了老根。查作风中，大家进一步找到过去长期闹纠纷，长期同领导上不一致，使方针无法贯彻的根本原因，发现自由主义、调和主义、宗派主义成了旧阶级思想的避难所。它钻了“照顾”、“民主”、“优待文化人”等空子，闹起各色各样无原则纠纷，妨碍了党和同志更多的从阶级上考虑工作改进工作。过去一向认为组织比较健全的报馆，这次清算了由于个人闹名誉、闹地位而形成的反党反领导，闹了极大的宗派主义、自由主义。一位入党二十余年的老同志，经过大家帮助及个人反省，发现自己从地主家庭带来的剥削意识基本未变，长期的闹名誉地位，在党内挑拨是非，进行宗派活动。引起上下不和，影响党内团结，进行了严重的反党反领导。以致在一年轰轰烈烈土地改革运动中，使党的方针不能很好贯彻。
    思想斗争发展到了高潮，犯了错误的同志们，沉痛表示忏悔，决心改过，并要求党给自己以严格处分，作为今后行动的监督。这次组织整顿结果：受处分者共三十一人；开除杜矢甲等五人，清洗了三个不改过的地主分子（其中有一个是大恶霸）。
    在结束文化界整顿队伍时，领导同志指出：这次学习只是我们进一步改造的开始，必须充分认识小资产阶级思想的顽强性，这次学习成果仍是极其不巩固的。回忆四二年整风运动，当时确实获有相当成果的。可是为时不久，有些人却又钻了“打通思想”、“照顾”、“民主”等空子，闹起更严重的自由主义和宗派主义。这一教训必须深记，今后要发扬批评和自我批评，严格组织生活，以后要定期的整，不断的整，天天洗脸深入群众，求得更好的锻炼改造。
  下乡后有新气象继续在斗争中改造
    现除留有一倍分同志坚持岗位工作外，已有将近三百余人自背行李，随同工作团分赴太行、冀南、冀鲁豫各地农村参加整编队伍和彻底平分，半个多月的体验，证明每个同志均有较显著转变，他们不怕吃苦受冻，同贫雇生活在一起。一位新从蒋管区来，自小娇生惯养的小姐，这次同农民生活在一起，认为自己要“咬紧牙关锻炼一下”。大多数同志阶级情感、生活方式已有初步改变，情绪高涨，在群众过年时也不愿停止调查工作。大家都下定决心要在斗争中让人民给自己做一个鉴定。
