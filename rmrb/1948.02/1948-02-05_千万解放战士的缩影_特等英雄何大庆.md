    Epitome of Millions of Liberated Fighters
    Special Class Hero He Daqing
    Liberated fighter He Daqing is one of the tens of thousands of liberated fighters. He originally belonged to the 1st Company of the Transportation Battalion of the 24th Brigade of the 76th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in northern Shaanxi. He was liberated by our forces during a guerrilla war last April and immediately joined the People's Liberation Army. In six months, he participated in dozens of battles, and his name was written on the merit book eight times. He was initially awarded the title of "Model Soldier" and later promoted to platoon leader. He is an excellent machine gunner, and his greatest characteristics are his extraordinary bravery in battle and strict adherence to battlefield discipline. During the Shajiadian battle last year, he used his machine gun to repel several enemy counterattacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. When the enemy retreated, he grabbed his rifle and grenades and desperately pursued them, capturing a large number of weapons. He only realized he was barefoot when he returned after the battle. He did not take any of the enemy's abandoned rubber shoes. He also possesses unparalleled perseverance in enduring hardship and a spirit of helping comrades. Despite the blisters on his hands, he dug a single-person foxhole in ten minutes and two machine gun emplacements in one hour. His motto is: "Sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime." Once, when the unit was traveling through the desert, he was suffering from dysentery. The company commander advised him to stay behind to recuperate, but he resolutely refused, gritting his teeth and keeping up with the unit. He was afraid of falling behind along the way, so he simply took off his pants and walked, often carrying his machine gun and helping weaker comrades carry their guns. During a battle last year, the unit marched more than 150 li (approximately 75 kilometers) every day, and many comrades were very tired. Every day upon reaching the destination, Platoon Leader He Daqing would let the soldiers rest, while he busied himself boiling water for everyone to wash their feet. Because of his series of merits, He Daqing is now a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party and has been awarded the title of "Special Class Hero." He is only twenty years old this year. He is from Yibin, Sichuan, and used to farm at home. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), he was arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and forced onto the battlefield of civil war.

    千万解放战士的缩影
    特等英雄何大庆
    解放战士何大庆是成千成万的解放战士之一，他原属陕北蒋匪七十六师二十四旅辎重营一连，去年四月在一次游击战争中被我解放过来，并立即参加了解放军。在六个月中，身经数十战，功劳簿上把他的名字写上八次，开始被奖为“模范战士”，后来升级为排长。他是一个优秀的机枪射手，他的最大特点是战斗中异乎寻常的勇敢和严格遵守战场纪律。去年沙家店战斗中，他用机枪打退了敌人几次反扑，予敌重大杀伤。当敌人溃退时，他又拿着步枪和手榴弹拼命追击，缴获大量武器。战斗结束回来时才发现他赤着脚。敌人遗弃遍地的胶鞋，他一件都没有动用。他还有不可比拟的吃苦耐劳的毅力和帮助同志的精神，不顾手上打起了血泡，曾以十分钟挖好一个单人掩体，一点钟速度挖好两处机枪工事。他的格言是：“平时多流汗，战时少流血”。某次部队经由沙漠行车时，他正在患痢疾，连长劝他留下休养，他坚决拒绝，咬紧牙关紧跟部队行进，他怕沿途掉队，索性脱下裤子走路，并经常扛着机枪，并帮助体弱同志背枪。去年某次战斗中，部队每日行军一百五十多里，许多同志走的很疲乏。每天到了目的地，何大庆排长即让战士休息，自己忙去烧水给大家洗脚。因为他一连串的功劳，何大庆现在已是光荣的中国共产党党员，并荣获“特等英雄”的称号。他今年才只有二十岁。四川宜宾人、在家种地、民国卅三年被蒋匪抓捕驱上内战战场。
