    Zanhuang Convenes Meeting of Poor and Middle Peasants and Rural Cadres
    Large-Scale Promotion of the Land Law

    [Zanhuang News] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, the masses in various villages were very concerned, but because there was no good publicity and explanation, the thinking of some masses was quite confused. The county leadership discovered this situation and quickly summoned the responsible cadres of each district for discussion. In the middle of this month, they held meetings of about 1,600 poor, middle peasants, and village cadres at the base points of each district to discuss the Outline Land Law, aiming to dispel the masses' misunderstandings about the Land Law and continue to implement winter production. The meeting revealed the following: First, poor and hired peasants urgently demand to hold power. A poor peasant from Douling Village said, "Last year during the overthrow, the district, county, and commissioner's office all said that poor and hired tenant farmers were the backbone, but when it came to the struggle, we were called the backbone, and when it came to dividing the fruits, we were no longer the backbone." Poor peasants from Beima Village, Fengjia Village, Yanhuy, Gushan, Nanxingguo and other villages all said that they did not dare to speak in the village. A poor peasant from Jiaying Temple said, "When discussing loans, the poor and hired peasants came up with six households, but the village cadres did not follow through. I didn't get a loan either, and the cadres still made the decisions." When the fifth district held a meeting, poor and hired peasants from Wujia Village, Beihao and other villages did not dare to speak at the meeting or in the group, and pulled the person in charge of the meeting aside to speak outside the village. A poor and hired peasant from Beihao asked, "Can we be the masters or not?" Second, some village cadres are afraid of poor and hired peasants holding power. For example, some village cadres in the first district said, "From now on, whether we have anything or not, the poor and hired peasants will speak," "If the poor and hired peasants tell us to step down, we will step down." The Guo Zhuang village cadres, after receiving the notice, did not call the poor and middle peasants to participate in the meeting, and excused themselves by saying, "We saw that the notice had cadres, so we didn't read further." Third, middle peasants are afraid of touching floating wealth. Some middle peasants said, "Let them have the land if they want it, but it's not comfortable to have another family move in when I already live in one house," "It's really not good to divide things up equally." During the group discussion and explanation, the leadership particularly emphasized that poor and hired peasants must hold power, affirm that the middle peasants will not be touched, upper-middle peasants will not have their floating wealth touched, and as long as cadres stand on the side of the poor and hired peasants, work hard now to organize poor and hired peasants in production, and work hard in the future to lead poor and hired peasants to turn over, those who share more fruits should prepare to withdraw early and still be good cadres. The issue of prohibiting landlords, rich peasants, and speculators from selling, destroying, and wasting property was also discussed, and everyone was called upon to supervise.

    This method of large-scale promotion of the Land Law can enable all farmers to accept the Land Law positively, stabilize the middle peasants and some village cadres, and expose various distortions and rumors. This is good. However, in some places, many poor and hired peasants are still oppressed and dare not speak. Using this method alone is obviously not enough. The cadres of the Licun Gou District went deep into the poor and hired peasants' homes to inquire about their suffering, publicize the Land Law, and patiently explain it. Only when they understand it can they truly speak their hearts, break all kinds of worries, and take active action to ensure the thorough implementation of the Land Law.

### 赞皇召集贫中农村干会  大规模宣传土地法

    赞皇召集贫中农村干会
    大规模宣传土地法
    【赞皇消息】土地法大纲公布后，各村群众都很关心，但是因为没有很好的宣传解释，有些群众的思想相当混乱。县领导上发现了这种情形，赶紧召集各区负责干部讨论了一下，又在本月中旬，在各区分基点召开了约一千六百人的雇贫中农及村干会议，讨论土地法太纲，目的在于解除群众对土地法的误解，继续贯彻冬季生产。在这次会上看出来：第一、雇贫农迫切要求掌权。陡岭村贫农说：“去年翻身时，区里、县里、专员公署里都说贫雇佃为骨干，可是闹斗争时叫俺当骨干，到分果实时就不成骨干了”。北马村、冯家村、延虎、孤山、南邢郭等村贫农都提出在村里不敢说话。嘉应寺贫农说：“贷款时雇贫农讨论出了六户，村干部不照办，我也没贷下，还是由干部做主”。五区开会时，武家村、北毫等村贫雇不敢在会上说，也不敢在小组里说，把主持会的负责人抽空拉到村外去说。北毫贫雇问：“到底能当家不能哩？”第二、部分村干怕贫雇掌权。如一区村干组有的村干说：“今后有啥没啥，贫雇说话吧”，“贫雇叫咱下台就下台”。郭庄村干接通知后，竟没叫雇贫中农去参加会，并借口说：“我们见通知上有干部，就没往下看”。第三、中农怕动浮财。有的中农说：“土地给就给点吧，自己住了一处房，再住进一家来可是不顺劲”，“东西打乱平分实在不好”。在小组讨论与解释中，领导上特别着重指出：贫雇必须掌权，肯定中农不动，上中农不动浮财，干部只要站在贫雇方面，现在努力组织贫雇生产，将来努力领导贫雇翻身，多分果实的早点准备退出，还能当个好干部。对禁止地主富农及投机分子变卖破坏浪费财产等事情也作了讨论，号召大家起来监督。  （赞皇联合办公室）
    这种大规模宣传土地法的方式，可使全体农民正面的接受土地法，稳定中农和一部分村干部，揭破各种曲解和谣言，这是好的。但是，有些地方许多贫雇还受着压迫，不敢讲话，只用这种方式显然不够，李村沟区干部深入贫雇访苦，宣传土地法，耐心解释，他们懂得了，才能真正说出知心话，打破各种顾虑，积极行动起来，保证土地法彻底实现。
