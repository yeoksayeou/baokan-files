A Lifetime of a Hired Laborer Talks of Hardships
— A Short Biography of Hired Laborer Jia Zhengfang

    My name is Jia Zhengfang, and I live in Hexi Village, Wu'an County. When my father was alive, there were six people in our family (my four brothers and my parents). We never had enough to eat, and we didn't own an inch of land. My father barely managed to support the family by working as a carpenter. My mother died when I was twelve. Seeing that these children of mine were uncared for and life was difficult, my father died in a fit of worry after only fifty days! He left behind four children. My brother Jia Deming was only six years old and was adopted by my uncle. My uncle introduced my eldest brother to work at a brick kiln, my second brother cooked for a wealthy family, and I herded cattle for a wealthy family. They only gave me food and no wages. Later, they found a woman to cook, and this woman had a child who could herd cattle, so they didn't need me anymore. At thirteen, I went to Sanwang Village to herd cattle, herding for several families. I lived in the house of the landlord Li Nianxi. After three years, they only gave me a little over eight strings of cash. One day, when I was herding cattle, I don't know how, but one of Li the landlord's cows went lame. His wife said that I had beaten it lame and didn't want me to herd cattle anymore. At the end of the year, when settling accounts, the landlord's wife said, "He eats our cooked food and earns us raw money (meaning cash), and he even beat his cow-daddy lame. Where is his conscience?" I ate what I suffered for, and I earned what I suffered for, and she still called the cow my father. Landlords are so mean! I went back home. I was sixteen at this time and herded sheep for a landlord in Shidong for a year. At seventeen, I became a long-term laborer at the house of Lao Ruizi in Hexi (a big landlord in Hexi). I lived there for five years, and I endured their exploitation and meanness. The landlord drank thick gruel and ate sesame candy early in the morning. At noon, it was either mianjin (gluten) or pork hock, or noodles. Every day was different. We poor people ate two meals of thin rice gruel a day, drinking clear rice water all year round, eating pickled vegetables. We didn't even drink rice water with beans in it. We only ate white flour four times a year (May Dragon Boat Festival, June 6th, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Autumn Harvest). Besides that, we ate it once when the wheat was harvested. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, they would give us a little hat-head meat (a few slices of meat on top of the vegetables). In the winter, we got up early (before dawn) to work in the fields, eating a little thin rice gruel, while the landlord lay on the kang (heated brick bed), warming himself by the fire, drinking wine and eating meat dishes. The landlord wanted chives with his pork hock, and the chives were only an inch high, but he wanted them, so we would go to the garden and cut them. When I ate thin rice gruel, I had no vegetables to eat with it, so I would pick a few scallions (a handful) from the garden to eat with it. When the landlord saw it, he would scold, "They're only that big, and you already want to eat them," saying that I shouldn't eat them. I ate two meals, while the landlord ate four (early morning, noon, dusk, and night).
    In the winter, the landlord covered himself with a fine silk quilt, wide and thick, while I was given a thin and narrow one that wouldn't even cover my body. Early in the morning, the landlord would light a coal fire. When it got cold in October, I would find some firewood to warm myself, and the landlord would say it wasn't cold and that burning the firewood was wasting his wood. As for clothes, the landlord wore a small cotton-padded jacket inside, a large cotton-padded jacket, and then a fur coat on top. He wore cotton socks, felt socks, and cotton shoes on his feet and warmed himself by the fire. The socks I wore revealed my feet, and I had only a thin, tattered cotton-padded jacket. It was so cold in the early morning that I would secretly warm myself in the "lower place" (where we laborers lived). When the landlord saw it, he would say, "Hmph, I told you to work early in the morning. Did I tell you to warm yourself by the fire?"
    The landlord lived in a spacious house, while I lived in the "lower place" with the livestock. Even on rainy days, I couldn't rest. I would strip hemp and mend saddlebags in the "lower place." Once, on a rainy day, I was stripping hemp in the room, and a broken mule was standing in the yard. When the landlord saw it, he said meanly, "Hmph, people know to shelter in the house, but I have to leave my mule in the rain!" Also, in the spring, another long-term laborer and I were carrying soil to reinforce the embankment. If we didn't fill the baskets completely, he would say, "Hey! You two can't even fill the baskets." If we filled them completely and the carrying pole broke, he would say that we broke his pole that hadn't broken in years. My shoulders were sore from carrying the heavy loads, but he didn't care. He only cared about his things breaking. The old miser valued his things more than he valued us laborers. Once, I was working in the threshing ground, and I left the broom on the ground. When he saw it, he scolded me again, "Hey! You never forget to eat, but you can't remember to pick up your things."
    In the hot weather, I was hoeing the fields. It was too hot, so I rested under a tree to cool off. The landlord came and said, "Hey! Is it that hot today! You can't rest there (referring to the field)? You have to come here (referring to under the tree)." He was afraid that I wasn't working enough. Alas, in those years, the landlord could say whatever he wanted. If he said it wasn't hot, I wouldn't dare to say it was hot. If he said it wasn't cold, I wouldn't dare to say it was cold. Anyway, we could only listen. I could write chapters and chapters about the meanness of the landlords I suffered under!
    After living as a long-term laborer for five years, at the age of twenty-two, I had some strength and energy. My brother didn't want me to be a long-term laborer anymore and took me to a brick kiln. At the kiln, I worked from dawn till dusk, handling mud and water all day long. My hands cracked. During the New Year, everyone else went home, but I stayed at the kiln. I continued to fire bricks until I was twenty-eight, accumulating some savings. I spent two hundred and twenty silver dollars to marry a wife. I couldn't even support my family by working odd jobs, so I rented six mu of land from Zhang Xilin to farm. I lost countless work opportunities and converted five mu of dry land into a garden for someone. I had to pay five dou of grain per mu, and three shi of grain a year, plus two sheng of wheat. In the fifth lunar month of the twenty-eighth year, my wife fell ill. In the seventh month, I also fell ill. I had planted the land, but neither of us could tend to it. I told the landlord to tend it himself. At this time, I still owed him three shi of grain. As a result, he harvested everything in the field and said it wasn't enough. He wanted me to pay him until the third month of the following year. I hadn't harvested any grain, but I still had to pay him. This is how landlords exploited us. That winter, after we recovered from our illnesses, we had nothing left at home, so we sold all our furniture, but it still wasn't enough to live on. I gave my little girl away to Nancongjing. My wife begged for food, but she couldn't feed three people (I had a son). There was no way. My wife saw that we couldn't survive at home and didn't want to beg for food, so she left, abandoning me and my child. In the thirtieth year, I farmed nine mu of poor land from Lao Ruizi that didn't measure up. I paid four dou of rent per mu. It was a bad year, and the nine mu of land didn't even yield three shi of grain. It only yielded two shi and six dou, but he still wanted me to pay three shi and six dou of rent. He took all two shi and six dou of grain away, leaving nothing for us. He even said, "Zhengfang, you still owe me one shi of grain!" I had nothing left at home, so I carried my child on my back and went to the enemy-occupied area (the area occupied by the Japanese) to work at a kiln. I earned twenty or thirty Japanese yen and exchanged it for forty or fifty yuan of Jicha, planning to buy some grain to feed my family when I returned. As soon as I returned, Lao Ruizi demanded that one shi of grain. I said I would work for others next year to pay it off, but he refused. He took me to the district office in Zhaozhuang. The district office spoke to the landlord, saying that my rent was to pay public grain. If the public grain could wait until next year, then I could pay next year. Otherwise, I had to pay this year. The landlord converted it into money for five dou and five sheng of rice. The two hundred strings of cash that I had worked so hard to earn at the kiln were immediately taken away by Lao Ruizi for one hundred and thirty strings. I didn't even have enough to buy grain! In the thirty-first year, I worked odd jobs again. During the famine year (thirty-second year), on the fourteenth day of the first month, some families ate pork hock for the Lantern Festival. My child saw someone selling mixed noodles and asked me to buy some. I didn't have any money, so I went to borrow money from my brother. I didn't get any. After much pleading, my brother borrowed me a catty of millet. I ate that catty of millet for half a month, eating sparingly. I ate a lot of rapeseed cake, sesame cake, and radish greens, which made my body swell. Once, my child was so hungry that he was in a terrible state. He ate some turnips from a neighbor's field. The neighbor came and got angry, hitting my child. I didn't mean to beat my child to death. My child was already starving and couldn't go on. I didn't expect that one blow would kill him. Since then, whenever I see other people's children, my heart feels ice-cold. If my child were still alive, he would be fourteen years old now. Now, I don't have a single child!
    I suffered my whole life, from the age of twelve until the year before last. After I started a family, I didn't have a house, so I lived in a temple. I didn't have anything to cover myself with, so I picked up some torn burlap sacks and rotten felt outside. I sewed them together and used them as a blanket. I suffered for so many years, but in the end, my wife left, my child died, and I was left as a bachelor. During the autumn harvest of the thirty-fifth year, I heard people say that the village cadres said I was a bachelor and no one would support me, so they rated my fruit output as third class (only four or five points). When they were distributing things to us, one cadre said, "Give him good stuff so he can marry a wife? He's a bachelor. Don't give him good stuff. Just give him a piece of clothing." I took a cloth roll and opened it. It was three pieces of children's foreign cloth. It didn't matter that they didn't give me anything, but when I saw the children's clothes, I thought of my child. If my child were still alive, I could have made clothes for him. My child is gone, and I'm forty-six years old. Whenever I think of it, my heart feels ice-cold (he cried). I've never gambled or smoked opium in my life. All I know how to do is suffer for others (working as a short-term laborer, long-term laborer, and at the kiln). I don't know how to do sneaky work (doing business). I've worked hard my whole life, without eating or drinking extravagantly, without being dishonest. The village only allocated me one mu of land and some broken things. In the year before last (thirty-fifth year), I bought three mu and two fen of land and two broken houses with my own hard work. Only then was I no longer starving, and I had a place to live. Last year, I married an old woman in her sixties, so I could finally have a family. (Written by Wu Fang)

    一辈子长工谈苦处
    ——雇工贾正方小传
    俺名叫贾正方，住在武安县河西村。俺爹时，有六口人（俺兄弟四个和俺爹娘），家里就没时光，一亩地也没有，光凭着俺爹做木匠养活一家子。俺十二岁娘就死了。俺爹看俺这些孩子没人经管，生活又困难，过了五十天，俺爹就急死啦！丢下四个孩子。俺兄弟贾德明才六岁就过继给俺叔叔了，俺舅把大哥引到窑上烧砖去了，二哥给财主家做饭，俺就给财主家放牛。人家光给饭吃不给工钱。后来人家觅了个妇女做饭，这个妇女有个小孩能放牛，人家就不要咱了。十三岁俺又到三王村放牛，放好几家的牛，俺住在地主李年席家（音），三年人家才给俺八吊多钱。有一天俺放牛，不知怎的李财主家一个牛拐了，人家老婆说俺给打拐的，就不要咱放牛了。年底算帐时，财主老婆说：“吃的俺家熟的，挣的俺家生的（指钱），还给他牛爹打拐了，他良心何在？”俺吃的是自己受的，挣的也是自己受的，她还叫牛是俺爹，财主多刻薄人啊！俺就回来了，这时俺十六岁，又在石洞财主家放了一年羊。十七岁就在河西老瑞子家（河西大财主）住长工，住了五年，俺也受尽了人家剥削和刻薄，人家财主清早滚稠饭，吃麻糖，晌不是面斤，就是肉胳＠，要不是面条，一天一个样，俺受苦人吃的是两顿涝饭，通年喝清米汤，吃酸菜，连豆下米汤都没喝过。俺一年只吃四次白面（五月端午、六月六、六秋及中秋节），除了这，收麦打一次场吃一回。过年初一，人家才给吃点帽头肉（菜面上两片肉）。冬天，咱起早（天不明）到地里受吃点涝饭，人家财主躺在炕上，烤着火，喝酒吃肉菜。人家财主吃肉胳＠要韭菜，韭菜才长寸把高，人家要，咱就去园割回来，俺吃涝饭没菜下，去园摘几根葱（掌把高）就饭，人家财主看见了就骂：“长这一点，你就好吃了它”，说咱不该吃，咱吃两顿饭，人家财主吃四顿（清早、晌午、黄昏、夜里）。

    热天，俺在地里锄地，热不过，俺到树下息下凉，人家财主来说：“嘿！这个天还热呢！在哪（指地里）不能息，还要来这里（指树下）”，怕俺少做活了，唉，那年景，人家财主说啥就是啥，热，人家说不热，俺就不敢热了，冷，人家说不冷，俺也不敢冷了，反正咱只敢听着，俺受的地主刻薄写几章也写不完呢！
