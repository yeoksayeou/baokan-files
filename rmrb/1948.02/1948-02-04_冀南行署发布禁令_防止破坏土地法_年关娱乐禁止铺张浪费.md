    Jinan Administrative Office Issues Prohibition
    Preventing Sabotage of Land Law
    Extravagant Waste Prohibited in Year-End Entertainment
    [Jinan News] The Jinan Administrative Office issued a prohibition on February 1st, forbidding any actions that sabotage the Land Law and protecting the interests of farmers. The original text is as follows: In order to prohibit the sabotage of the "Outline Land Law of China" and to protect the interests of the peasants, the following illegal acts are hereby prohibited: 1. All the fruits of mass struggles that have not yet been distributed should be registered and sealed up uniformly and not be distributed temporarily. They will be dealt with after the establishment of poor peasant leagues and peasant representative conferences in each village. Anyone who steals, seizes by force, embezzles, or uses them privately will be held responsible by the current village cadres and will be punished. 2. It is forbidden to slaughter livestock, to cut down trees, to destroy farm tools, houses or other items, and to buy and sell land, houses, trees, etc. 3. Landlords and rich peasants are prohibited from dispersing and selling all their property, from extravagant eating and drinking, and from private transfer of property. 4. Village cadres who have over-occupied or embezzled the fruits [of struggle] should preserve the original items so that they can be returned and should not be sold or destroyed. 5. Spreading rumors and sowing discord to undermine the Land Law is prohibited. Before the village poor peasant leagues and peasant representative conferences have made a resolution, no one is allowed to act on their behalf to carry out the equal distribution of land. It is even more forbidden to create false struggles and other disruptive acts. 6. Extravagant waste is prohibited in year-end entertainment. It is even more forbidden to use the fruits of struggle. Violators will be punished with compensation and other appropriate sanctions. 7. Arbitrary levies are prohibited. If the expenditure is legitimate, it must be approved by the district government before the poor peasant league is established. Anyone who violates the above articles must be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Sabotage of Land Reform by the Border Region Government. In order to ensure the implementation of this order: First, call on farm laborers and poor peasants, for your own benefit, to rise up to supervise village cadres, implement supervision, and prohibit destructive actions by landlords, rich peasants, and others. Second, we tell all middle peasants: According to the "Outline Land Law," your property is not to be touched; do not engage in extravagant eating and drinking; do not sell your property. Third, we warn all landlords, rich peasants, and cadres who have over-occupied or embezzled the fruits [of struggle]: you should await handling and not commit further illegal acts. (Attached notice: 1. Governments at all levels should reprint this order and distribute it to all villages in the form of notices or leaflets. 2. All cadres should carry out propaganda among the masses. 3. The village public offices and peasant associations are responsible for convening village meetings to read out [the order] and to implement it conscientiously.)
