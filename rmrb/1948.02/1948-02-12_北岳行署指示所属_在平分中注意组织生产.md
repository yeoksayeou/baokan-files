Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 9th Dispatch: To closely integrate land reform and production, the Beiyue Administrative Office and Financial Office recently instructed all prefectural and county governments to appropriately pay attention to organizing production during the process of the masses dividing land and wealth, in order to lay the foundation for this year's production. In areas with severe disasters, even more attention should be paid, but the focus of the equal distribution of land cannot be shifted. In terms of specific practices, attention should be paid to seizing the gaps between struggles to organize the masses to transport and sell goods. Livestock distributed to poor peasants should be used well and not left idle. In some areas, the masses have difficulty selling mountain products and medicinal materials; stores should take the initiative to help sell them externally. At the same time, all trade departments should pay attention to improving the operation of shops and forwarding stations, and reduce profits to reduce the difficulties for the masses in transportation and sales. After poor peasants are allocated movable property, they can organize production through new forms of mutual aid and cooperation. In mountainous areas, the masses can be organized to collect firewood, and stores and market management departments should develop firewood markets to facilitate firewood transactions, and organize the exchange of firewood for other materials. In short, it is necessary to promote the spirit of "saving money" and "saving effort" so that farmers can "obtain wealth and use wealth." The difficulties faced by liberated farmers in future production will certainly be many, such as a shortage of agricultural implements, seeds, and fertilizers. In addition to the general promotion of collecting manure and accumulating fertilizer in various ways to increase fertilizer, agricultural implements, etc., can be manufactured as soon as possible through various craftsmen providing mutual assistance or self-operation. Other channel disputes and those who need food loans and subsidies should be discussed by the poor peasant leagues and new peasant associations.

    北岳行署指示所属
    在平分中注意组织生产
    【新华社晋察冀九日电】北岳行署、财办，为使土改和生产密切结合，最近指示各专署县府要在群众分得土地财富的过程中，恰当的注意组织生产，以打下今年生产基础。在灾情严重地区更应注意，但不能转移了平分土地的中心，具体做法上应注意抓紧斗争间隙，组织群众运销运输，雇贫农分到的牲口，要很好使用，做到不闲。有些地区群众存有山货药材无法推销，商店要采取主动帮助向外推销。同时各贸易部门应注意改进店坊，及发货栈的经营，降低利润，以减少群众运销的困难。雇贫农分得浮财后，可通过新的互助合作形式组织生产，靠山地区可组织群众打柴，商店与市场管理部门，要发展柴火市，便利柴火买卖，并组织以柴火与其他物资交换。总之，要发扬“节财”“节力”精神，使农民做到“得财用财”。翻身农民今后生产上的困难，一定还是很多的，如农具、种籽、肥料缺的多，除普遍提倡集肥拾粪多方增肥外，农具等可通过各种匠人拨工互助或自己经营等方式，及早制造。其他渠道纠纷和那些人需要贷粮贷款补助等，贫雇团新农会都应加以商讨。
