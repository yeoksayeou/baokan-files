Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 18th Dispatch: Comrade Zhou Yang recently published an article in the Jin察冀 Daily entitled "Oppose the 'Fancy Talk' Style, Establish a Revolutionary and Pragmatic News Style." The article pointed out that the serious 'fancy talk' style within the Jin察冀 Party actually represents the interests of landlords and rich peasants. The ideological root of this 'fancy talk' style mainly reflects the opportunism and catering tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie in politics and ideology. This means not reporting according to the actual situation among the masses, but only giving certain leaders what they want. One point is exaggerated into ten, and even if something doesn't exist, it can be claimed to exist. Conversely, ten points can be diminished to one, or even made to disappear entirely. Everything starts from self-expression. This is a person devoid of Party spirit, class stance, and therefore a people's stance; a person of very poor quality. This is one of the important reasons why the Party is infected with the 'fancy talk' style. Comrade Zhou Yang especially pointed out that many comrades still lack the habit of conducting practical investigations and are not good at meticulously observing and analyzing from an ideological perspective. Therefore, they often cannot accurately describe and demonstrate a matter. When things are described as good, everything is good; when described as bad, everything is bad. Many news reports are solely based on conversations or reports from cadres, and rarely are journalists going deep into the masses, personally seeing with their own eyes, and directly investigating the masses.

Comrade Zhou Yang proposed that in order to establish a pragmatic style for the Party newspaper, it is necessary to, firstly, truthfully reflect the actual life of the workers and peasants, and pay special attention to their daily life and work. Lenin and Chairman Mao always told us to pay attention to everyday things, because everyday things are the most concrete, and also the most massive and universal. Secondly, we must pay attention to discovering new things in life, analyze them, and examine which of them have developmental prospects, which of them meet historical requirements, and which of them are bad. A Party news worker must have a clear class stance, viewpoint, and a certain degree of political sensitivity and foresight. Our Party's newspapers should not only allow people to see the things before their eyes but also see further than what's immediately visible. It must enlighten people's minds and guide people forward. The above two points are the basic methods of news work.

　　写新闻要讲实际
    【新华社晋察冀十八日电】周扬同志顷在晋察冀日报发表“反对客里空作风建立革命的实事求是的新闻作风”一文指出：晋察冀党内严重的客里空作风，实际上代表了地主富农的利益。这种客里空作风的思想根源，主要地是反映了小资产阶级在政治上和思想作风上的投机性和迎合性，就是不依照群众中的实际情况来报导，而专看某些领导者要什么就给什么，有一分讲成十分，没有的也可以讲成有，也可以把十分讲成一分，或者讲得没有，一切都从表现个人出发。这是一种毫无党性，毫无阶级立场，因而也没有人民立场的人，是一种品质很坏的人。这是党内沾染上客里空作风重要原因之一。周扬同志特别指出许多同志还很缺乏实际进行调查的习惯，还很不善于精密地从思想观察和分析，因而往往不能准确地叙述和论证一件事情。讲好就一切都好，讲坏就一切都坏。许多新闻报导是单纯从干部谈话或汇报听来的，很少是记者深入到群众中去，亲自用眼睛去看，直接向群众作调查得来的。
    周扬同志提出为建立党报实事求是的作风，必须第一，真实地反映工农群众的实际生活，特别要注意他们日常生活和工作，列宁和毛主席总是叫我们注意日常的东西，因为日常的东西是最具体的，同时也是最大量性、普遍性的。第二，要留心去发现生活中的新的东西，并加以分析，检查其中那些是有发展前途的，那些是合乎历史要求的，那些是不好的，一个党的新闻工作者，必须具有明确的阶级立场、和观点及一定的政治敏感和远见，我们党的报纸不但要叫人们看到眼前的事情，并且要看得比眼前更远一点，它必须启发人们思想，引导人们前进。上面两点是新闻工作的基本方法。
