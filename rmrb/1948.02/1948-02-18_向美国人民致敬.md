    A Salute to the American People
    From January 23rd to 25th, the National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East, initiated by the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, was held in New York. The conference resolved to take action to resist the US government's provision of military supplies and other assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and the Dutch and French aggressors. This included the nearly 50,000-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has already decided to implement an embargo on foreign aid war materials. Earlier this month, the anti-Chiang aid movement in American student circles also began. This is a righteous action by the American people to aid the oppressed people of China and other countries in the Far East, and we express our highest respect to the American people.
    In the past two years, progressive groups in the United States have continuously supported the just struggle of the Chinese people. The China and Far East Conference held in San Francisco in October 1946 adopted resolutions demanding that the US government withdraw its troops stationed in China and stop providing military and economic aid to Chiang Kai-shek for the civil war. Since last year, American progressive groups and individuals have continuously criticized the US government's reactionary policy toward China and supported the Chinese people's movement for independence and democracy. This "National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East" has a broader mass character, and its resolutions call for direct action.
    American imperialists are trying to cover up their criminal acts of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang within the United States. They tell the American people that the American imperialist government is aiding Chiang Kai-shek because Chiang Kai-shek's army is "fighting for the survival of the English-speaking people." They attempt to portray the interests of a handful of banking tycoons and arms dealers on Wall Street as the interests of the entire United States and even the entire "English-speaking people." But the American imperialists' arrogant conspiracy to aid Chiang Kai-shek and destroy China is not only against the Chinese people, but also a brutal attack on the interests of the American people. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the US government has provided Chiang Kai-shek with more than 4 billion US dollars worth of military supplies and loans to aid the civil war. American banking tycoons and arms dealers have obtained huge profits from this, while the entire burden falls on the American people in the form of increased taxes and inflation (rising prices). American financial capital is trying to deprive the American people of their basic democratic rights at home and is implementing a policy of starvation against the American people. Facts have proven that American imperialists are the mortal enemies of the American people, and the interests of the American people are completely consistent with the interests of the Chinese nation.
    The righteous actions of the American people have given great encouragement to the Chinese people's war of liberation. The Chinese people also deeply know that the victory of the People's Liberation Army over the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek is also helping the American people. The great international unity between the Chinese and American people will be an important guarantee for the victory of the Chinese and American people in the just struggle against American imperialism.

    向美国人民致敬
    一月二十三日至二十五日，在纽约召开了由美国远东民主政策委员会发起的美国对华及远东政策全国会议，这会议决议以行动抵制美政府以军火武器及其他援助给予蒋介石及荷法侵略者，包括近五万工人的美国码头及仓库工人工会，业已决定实行援外作战物资禁运工作。本月初，美国学生界的反对援蒋运动亦已开始。这是美国人民援助中国及远东其他国家被压迫人民的正义行动，我们向美国人民表示崇高的敬意。
    过去两年中，美国人民的进步团体曾不断声援中国人民的正义斗争，一九四六年十月间在旧金山召开的中国与远东大会，曾通过了要求美政府撤退驻华军队及制止以军事经济援蒋内战的决议，去年以来美国进步团体及进步人士更不断抨击美国政府的反动的对华政策，声援中国人民的独立民主运动。此次“对华及远东政策全国会议”则带着更广泛的群众性质，其决议则号召直接的行动。
    美国帝国主义者在美国国内力图掩饰其援助蒋介石匪帮的罪恶勾当，他们告诉美国人民说，美国帝国主义政府之所以援助蒋介石，因为蒋介石军队是“为英语民族的生存而作战”。他们企图把华尔街屈指可数的银行大王与军火大王的利益，描写为所谓整个美国与甚至整个“英语民族”的利益。但美国帝国主义援蒋灭华的狂妄阴谋，不仅是反对中国人民，而且同时就是对美国人民利益的残酷进攻。美国政府自抗日战争以来，以四十万万美元以上的军火物资及贷款援蒋内战，美国的银行大王与军火大王从中获得巨大利润，而全部负担则以租税增加、通货膨胀（物价高涨）的形式落在美国人民身上。美国财政资本正在国内力图剥夺美国人民所享有的各项基本民主权利，并对美国人民实行饥饿政策。事实证明美帝国主义者就是美国人民的死敌，而美国人民的利益与中华民族的利益则是完全一致的。
    美国人民的正义行动给了中国人民的解放战争以巨大的鼓励。中国人民也深知人民解放军对美国帝国主义走狗蒋介石的胜利，就是对美国人民的帮助，中美两国人民伟大的国际团结，将是中美人民在反对美国帝国主义的正义斗争中取得胜利的重要保证。  （二月十六日）
