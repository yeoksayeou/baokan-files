　　Joint Investigation by the Border Government and this Newspaper Reveals the Truth of the Wei Dianhua Case
　　Relevant Perpetrators Will Be Subject to People's Justice
　　[News from this newspaper] The incident of Wei Dianhua, a poor peasant, hired laborer, and honorably retired soldier from Xisuzhuang, Third District of Shahe, being falsely accused as a "special agent," has garnered significant attention from readers across various regions following its exposure in this newspaper, with numerous letters of inquiry received. After an eighteen-day investigation, the truth of the entire case has come to light. Wei Dianhua, with the boundless loyalty and bravery of a Communist Party member, waged an unyielding struggle against landlords and traitors who had infiltrated the Party and manipulated village governance to oppress the poor and hired laborers. He suffered severe persecution. Due to bureaucratic leadership, justice has only now been served. The sequence of events is as follows:
　　Wei Dianhua, a 56-year-old man who had been a hired farmhand for three generations, joined the Party in 1938 and participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, later serving as a traffic officer for the enemy work station, undertaking secret missions. He consistently demonstrated resolve by repeatedly completing arduous tasks. Due to old age and disability, he honorably retired to his hometown in the summer of 1946 and once again engaged in a tenacious struggle against landlords and traitors who had infiltrated the Party. He was falsely accused of being a "special agent," enduring immense suffering, forbidden from speaking to others, and prohibited from leaving the village. Later, upon seeing the grievances of the poor and hired laborers in the newspaper, he secretly escaped to this newspaper to appeal for justice. He said, "I will be responsible for every word I say. I am old, and while I may have difficulty remembering things, I will never exaggerate." This newspaper initially determined the nature of the problem as an attack by landlords on the poor and hired laborers. However, due to the complexity of the situation and the urgent need for investigation, he was introduced to the Border Government. The Border Government also attached great importance to the matter. Chairmen Yang and Zhang personally spoke with him and decided to dispatch an investigation team jointly with this newspaper. Wei, having suffered from bureaucracy in the past, harbored suspicions towards the investigation team. On the way, he said, "You will send me to the Special Commissioner's Office, who will then send me to the county, who will then send me to the district, who will then send me to the village, and my problem will still not be resolved."
　　After the investigation team arrived at the Sixth Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee Secretary Zhang Huiru and Commissioner Hou Guoying immediately convened relevant county and district cadres (including Comrade Wang Dian, who introduced Wei into the Party) that same evening to study the situation and further determine the nature of the problem. County and district leaders, who had previously viewed this as a sectarian struggle, began to realize that they had been looking at the poor and hired laborers with a sectarian perspective. Comrade Wang Dian, who had previously supported Wei Dianhua and received much criticism for it, dared not intervene after Wei was "rectified" as a "special agent." The next day, he made a sincere self-criticism to Wei Dianhua. Wei Dianhua was overcome with emotion as if seeing a family member, and both wept. Wei expressed that even if his bones turned to ashes, he would never collude with those landlords and traitors. Everyone present could not help but shed tears.
　　To facilitate the investigation, it was decided to transfer the main perpetrators to the county government. The team, in conjunction with county and district comrades, went directly into the villages to deeply engage with the poor and hired laborers. Another person was left behind to investigate among the village cadres. Initially, the poor and hired laborers were afraid to speak, while the village cadres formed a clique, shielding each other and continuing to slander Wei Dianhua. After individually visiting, listening to their grievances, and talking with them, the poor and hired laborers began to speak about their failure to achieve liberation and exposed the various crimes of the landlords who manipulated village governance and oppressed the poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants (details to follow). Then, separate forums of the poor and hired laborers were convened, and at the same time, based on the materials already obtained, the village cadres were shown the serious attitude of the investigation team. They were told to frankly confess their mistakes to the people and continue to expose each other's misdeeds. The truth of the Wei case then became clearer (details to follow). Following this, joint forums of the middle and poor peasants were convened, clarifying that the landlords' attack on Wei Dianhua was intended to further oppress the poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants. At this time, Wei Dianhua and the main perpetrators had already returned to the village. Thus, a meeting of middle and poor peasants was convened. One after another, people spoke about their grievances, with some raising their hands requesting to speak. The meeting did not end in the morning, nor did it end in the afternoon, but continued late into the night. After deliberation and discussion at the meeting, it was decided to temporarily send the main perpetrators, Wei Jintang and Wei Jingwu, to the county for detention, so that they could be handed over to the people's court for trial. Other bad village cadres were left in the village to repent, to be dealt with according to the extent of their confession and repentance. During the meeting, the bad village cadres were lined up on the side. Wei Yousheng, the finance and grain director, was relatively upright and had not done anything bad. The poor peasant Wei Laixin automatically pulled him out of the group of bad village cadres in public and brought him to stand among the masses. The county party committee has now decided to reinstate Wei Dianhua's Party membership, while urging comrades who practiced bureaucracy and engaged in sectarianism against the poor peasants to deeply reflect on their actions and give them appropriate punishment. Wei Dianhua, until the very end, did not show any signs of arrogance. The county party committee has now established a work team to continue the investigation, thoroughly resolve all problems, and lead the land redistribution movement in Xisuzhuang.

　　边府本报共同调查结果
    魏殿花冤案大白
  　有关案犯将分别受到人民裁判
    【本报消息】沙河三区西苏庄贫雇荣退军人魏殿花被诬害为“特务”的事件在本报披露后，各地读者均极注意，纷纷来函询问。现经十八天的调查，全案真相大白。魏殿花以共产党员的无限忠诚勇敢对钻进党内，操纵村政权，压迫贫雇的地主、汉奸进行不屈不挠的斗争。遭受了严重的迫害。由于领导上的官僚主义，至今始得昭雪。前后经过如下：
    魏殿花是三代长工，五十六岁，三八年入党，参加抗战，后任敌工站交通员，做秘密工作。屡次完成艰险任务，一贯表现坚决。因年老残废，于四六年夏荣退回乡，又与钻进党内的地主、汉奸展开顽强斗争，被诬指为“特务”，受尽痛苦，不准与人说话，不准离村。后见贫雇在报上诉苦，遂偷跑逃来本报申冤。他说：“我每一句话都要负责，我老了，只有记不清的，决没有多说了的。”本报初步确定了问题性质，是地主向贫雇进攻，但因其中关系复杂，急需调查，即介绍他到边府，边府亦极重视，杨、张主席亲自与他谈话，并决定与本报共派调查小组出发。魏因过去历来吃惯官僚主义的亏，对调查小组存有怀疑。路上他说：“你们把我送到专署，专署又送县，县又送区，区又送村，我问题还是不能解决。”
    调查小组到六地委后，当晚地委书记张慧如、专员侯国英即召集县、区有关干部（包括介绍魏入党的王典同志）研究情况，进一步确定问题性质，过去认为这是宗派斗争的县、区领导同志，开始觉悟是自己以宗派眼光去看贫雇。王典同志曾为给魏殿花撑腰受过不少批评，把他“整”成“特务”以后就不敢再管了，次日他向魏殿花作诚恳反省，魏殿花如见亲人，双方痛哭。魏表示骨头烂成灰也不能和那些地主、汉奸搞到一起。在旁同志，均不禁落泪。
    为便于调查，决定把主要案犯调到县府，小组结合县、区同志，到村直接深入贫雇。另留一人专在村干中调查。起初贫雇不敢说话，村干则结成一伙，互相包庇，继续诬蔑魏殿花。经个别访苦谈心，贫雇从自己没有翻身的情况开始谈，揭发地主操纵村政，压迫贫雇中农的种种罪恶（详情见后）。于是分别召集不定数的贫雇座谈，同时依据已得材料，向村干表明严正态度，要他们向人民坦白悔过，并且互相继续揭发材料。魏案真相遂更明晰。（详情见后）接着贫雇中农共同座谈，明确了地主打击魏殿花乃是为了更能压迫贫雇中农。此时魏殿花及主犯均已回村，于是召开中、贫农大会，会上诉苦的一个紧接一个，有人举着双手要求发言，上午没有开完，下午还没有开完，晚上又开到深夜。经大会酝酿讨论，决定将主犯魏锦堂、魏景武暂送县扣押，以便交人民法庭审判。其他坏村干留村反省，按其坦白悔过程度分别处理。开会时坏村干被列在一旁，财粮主任魏有生比较正派，没干坏事，贫雇魏赖心自动当众把他从坏村干中拉出，站到群众中来了。现县委已决定恢复魏殿花的党籍，对官僚主义向贫雇闹宗派的同志，则督促其深刻反省，给以适当处分。而魏殿花直到最后，没有任何骄傲的表现，现县委已成立了工作团，继续调查，彻底解决所有的问题，领导西苏庄的平分运动。
