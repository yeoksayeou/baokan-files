    Peking University Agricultural College Experimental Sugar Factory
    Selling Brown and White Sugar and Soliciting Opinions
    Our college's teachers and students, in order to establish the sugar industry in this border region, personally labored and researched technology, and have already produced preliminary brown and white sugar. We now solicit opinions from all sectors of society in order to improve technology, teach the poor and hired masses, and lay the foundation for the sugar industry. We are currently consigning various types of brown and white sugar for sale at the Yetao Veterinary Hospital, Henan Street Veterinary Hospital, Lucheng Veterinary Hospital, and Changzhi Veterinary Hospital. Prices are low and quality is pure and good. We also request that purchasing users provide standards for improvement to serve as research goals. Your participation is most welcome!
