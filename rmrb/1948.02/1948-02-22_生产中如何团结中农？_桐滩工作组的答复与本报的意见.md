　　How to Unite Middle Peasants in Production?
　　The Reply of the Tongtan Work Group and the Opinion of This Newspaper
　　On January 25th, this newspaper published news from the Second Commissioner's Office Work Group regarding the implementation of the poor and hired peasant line in Tongtan Town, Zuoquan County. The village cadres examined the fact that they had not followed the "poor and hired peasant line" in winter production, and therefore decided on three measures: first, understand and solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants; second, organize the poor and hired peasants to do whatever they are good at; third, let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is most profitable. At that time, this newspaper believed that this way of following the "poor and hired peasant line" did not conform to the Party's policy of relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting middle peasants. Therefore, we put forward opinions and asked the Tongtan Work Group to check.
　　In early February, this newspaper received a timely review and response from the comrades of the work group. The gist of their reply was: In the past winter production, the mobilization and organization of poor and hired peasants were neglected. Therefore, discussions were held among the cadres, "requiring the implementation of the poor and hired peasant line in January to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants and organize the production of poor and hired peasants to meet their demands." In terms of practices, in addition to organizing some poor and hired peasants to participate in transportation, semi-able-bodied laborers had no way out. Because some of them had run stores, and some of the stores opened by the mutual aid society were extravagant and wasteful, one was a "feudal" manager, and two were middle peasants. The leadership composition was not good, and the masses were dissatisfied, so they thought about the need to transform the stores. A meeting of poor and hired peasants was convened. After deliberation, it was decided that seventeen households would participate. Subsequently, a meeting of middle and poor peasant cooperative members was held, proposing to organize the poor and hired peasants to open stores and withdraw 200,000 yuan of funds for other production. The masses accepted this and approved the opening of stores by the seventeen poor and hired peasant households. After the transformation, the poor and hired peasant stores were very profitable. The shares withdrawn from the stores were used for other production, which was more profitable than running the stores, and the middle peasants were very satisfied. In addition, the transportation of middle peasants was also organized, without infringing upon the interests of the middle peasants. At the same time, it was also mentioned: "Because this manuscript is about studying the 'poor and hired peasant line', not about 'how poor and hired peasants unite middle peasants in production', therefore, we believe that the title: 'One-sided emphasis on the interests of poor and hired peasants' is a bit too affirmative and somewhat different from the focus of the original manuscript." We appreciate the research spirit of the Tongtan Work Group, but we also believe that there are some issues of principle that are worth discussing. Therefore, we sent a letter directly to the work group, raising several questions, such as: Is it appropriate to say "let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is most profitable"? Is it appropriate for the seventeen poor and hired peasants to accept all the stores of the mutual aid society and exclude the leadership composition of the middle peasants? ...... and so on.
　　On February 15th, we received a reply from the comrades of the work group. First of all, they believed that the criticism in the first letter that the title was too affirmative was incorrect, because they themselves had not properly checked their work. Their letter said: "We are very anxious about the production of poor and hired peasants, but we only help middle peasants with livestock, and we don't know much about and haven't organized help for middle peasant households without livestock, that is to say, we haven't done it. We emphasized taking care of the interests of poor and hired peasants." "Through this writing, we realized that attention should be paid to the way questions are raised and to seeing problems one-sidedly." In the first question, their examination was: "Let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is profitable." Although it did not form a slogan among the masses, in practice, it emphasized taking care of the poor and hired peasants and neglected the middle peasants who had difficulties. On the issue of stores, they believed that the transformation was voluntary by the middle peasants, and that the poor and hired peasants spent less and could make money by opening stores. Second question: The shares of the five stores were all accepted by the poor and hired peasants, and the funds were mainly the fruits of struggle, which were operated by the mutual aid team. The mutual aid society provided capital to support the value. When the poor and hired peasants accepted it, the mutual aid society had already withdrawn its shares. Third question: Regarding the issue of poor and hired peasants in power uniting middle peasants, they believed that there were achievements in solving the difficulties of poor and hired peasants and mobilizing the production of poor and hired peasants. The production of middle peasants has been organized into mutual aid groups, but the leadership composition has not been resolved.
　　From the entire process of our two studies with the Tongtan Work Group on the class line in production, we believe that this study is very good. They provided a lot of materials, which helped us a lot. In order to seek complete agreement on this issue, we put forward the following opinions for joint discussion with the comrades of the Tongtan Work Group and readers who are concerned about this issue.
　　1. Before the poor and hired peasants can completely turn over and become masters, we must first care about and solve the practical difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in order to mobilize and organize production. The starting point of the comrades of the Tongtan Work Group is completely correct. However, when solving the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants, the interests of the middle peasants must not be harmed in the slightest. The saying "Let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is profitable" is wrong. Doing so will inevitably harm the interests of the middle peasants. For the voluntary issue of the middle peasants, we cannot be satisfied with the superficial form of voluntariness. This voluntariness is often compulsory in substance. The leadership must never be confused by this. It should be to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants and unite the middle peasants to produce together.
　　2. In leading and mobilizing production, we must and should solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. Forgetting the poor and hired peasants is wrong. But from the perspective of the leadership composition of production, and from the entire process of organizing and mobilizing production, we must never exclude the middle peasants. On the contrary, we also need to greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the middle peasants on the basis of mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the poor and hired peasants. Without the participation and leadership of the middle peasants in the production team, it is impossible to do well.
　　3. Regarding the specific practices of transforming stores in Tongtan Town, we believe that specific research can be done in combination with the above opinions. The idea of talking about composition in this kind of store opening still needs to be considered. Middle peasants opening stores does not necessarily mean that they will open them badly. This is "component-ism", which will limit the mobilization of the production enthusiasm of the middle peasants and develop a one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants. In fact, it is not beneficial to the poor and hired peasants.

### 生产中如何团结中农？  桐滩工作组的答复与本报的意见

　　生产中如何团结中农？
    桐滩工作组的答复与本报的意见
    本报一月二十五日曾发表二专署工作组寄来的左权桐滩镇生产中执行贫雇路线的消息。该村干部检讨了冬季生产中没有走“贫雇路线”，因此便决定三个办法：第一是了解与解决贫雇困难；第二是贫雇会干啥就组织啥；第三是什么利最大，就让贫雇干。当时本报认为这样走“贫雇路线”是不符合党的依靠贫雇、团结中农的方针的，因此便提出意见，请桐滩工作组检查。
    二月初，本报接到工作组同志的及时检查与回答，他们答复中的大意是：过去冬季生产，忽视了贫雇的发动与组织，因此在干部中做了讨论，“要求在一月份要贯彻贫雇路线，解决贫雇困难。组织贫雇生产，来满足贫雇要求。”在作法上，除组织一部分贫雇参加运输外，半辅助劳力没出路，因为其中有人开过店，而互助社所开的店房中有的很铺张浪费，一个是“封建”当经理，两个是中农。领导成份不好，群众不满，便想到需要改造店房的问题。召开了贫雇会，经过酝酿，决定十七户参加。随后召开了中贫农社员大会，提出组织贫雇开，并抽出二十万元资金搞其他生产，群众接受了，批准了那十七户贫雇开店。改造后，贫雇店很赚钱。从店房中抽回的股金作其他生产，比开店时还赚钱，中农很满意，此外还组织了中农运输，并未侵犯中农利益。同时也提到：“由于这个稿子，我们是研究‘贫雇路线’，不是谈‘贫雇如何团结中农生产’，因此认为标题上：‘片面强调贫雇利益’有些太肯定，和原稿的重点有些不一样。”我们对桐滩工作组这种研究精神感到很好，但在某些带有原则性质的问题上我们也认为有值得商榷的地方，因此便直接给工作组去信，提了几个问题。譬如“什么利最大就让贫雇干”，这样的提法是否妥当？十七个贫雇是否接受互助社全部店房，排斥中农领导成份是否合适…………？等。
    二月十五日，我们接到了工作组同志的答复，首先他们认为第一次来信中提到的认为标题太肯定的批评是不对的，因为他们自己没从工作上好好检查。他们信上说：“我们对贫雇生产很着急，而对中农只是帮助有牲口的，对没有牲口的中农户了解不多，组织帮助不够，也就是说没有做。对贫雇的利益强调照顾。”“经过这次写稿，体会到问题的提法与片面看问题的应该注意”。在第一个问题他们的检查是：“什么有利就让贫雇干”，虽没有形成群众的口号，但在作法上是强调照顾贫雇，对有困难的中农是忽视的。在店房问题上，他们认为改造是中农的自愿，贫雇开店花销省，能赚钱。第二个问题：五个店房的股金全归贫雇接受，资金主要是斗争果实，由互助队经营，互助社出资本来扶值，归贫雇接受时，互助社股金已抽了股。第三个问题：关于贫雇当权团结中农的问题，他们认为在解决贫雇困难、发动贫雇生产上看是有成绩的，中农生产都已组织到互助组内，就是领导成份问题没解决。
    从我们两次与桐滩工作组研究生产中的阶级路线的整个经过看，我们认为这次的研究很好，他们提供很多的材料，对我们帮助很大；为了将这个问题求得认识上的完全一致，特提出以下的意见与桐滩工作组同志及关心这一问题的读者，共同商讨。
    一、在贫雇农未能彻底翻身当家之前，我们要发动与组织生产，就首先必须关心与解决贫雇农的切身困难，桐滩工作组同志的出发点完全是对的。但当解决贫雇困难的时候，丝毫不能损害中农利益。“什么有利就让贫雇干”的提法是错误的，这样做的结果，势必损害中农利益。对于中农自愿问题，不能满足于表面的形式的自愿，这种自愿往往是以强迫为实质的。领导上决不能迷惑这一点，应该是解决贫雇困难，团结中农，一道生产。
    二、在领导与发动生产中我们必须而且应该解决贫雇困难，忘了贫雇是错误的。但从生产的领导成份上讲，从组织与发动生产的全过程讲，我们绝不能排斥中农，相反的，我们还需要在贫雇农生产热情发动的基础上，大大的鼓舞中农的热情，生产队伍里，没有中农的参加与领导，是不可能做得好的。
    三、关于桐滩镇改造店房等具体作法上的问题，我们认为可结合以上意见，再作具体研究。这种开店也要讲成份的提法与思想还可考虑，中农开店不一定就开坏，这是“唯成份论”，这样会限制了中农生产热情的发动，发展了片面的贫雇观点，其实对贫雇是无利的。
