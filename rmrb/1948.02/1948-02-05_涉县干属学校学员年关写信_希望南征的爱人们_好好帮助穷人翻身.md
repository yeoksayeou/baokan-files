    【Taihang News】The old lunar year is almost here, and the students of the families' school for southern-bound cadres in Shexian County are writing letters to the Taihang Xinhua Daily, hoping to convey their inner thoughts to their relatives far away in the South. They hope that they will be able to put their minds at ease in the front to kill the enemy, help the poor people in the South to turn over, and strive to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. Zhao Jiuzhou and Hao Peilan, the principal and comrade of the school, said in their letters: "Comrades of the Southern Expedition Cadres: We are very happy to see the news of your victory after you went south in the newspaper. How are you all! Since you left, our county's work-study school has been immediately changed to a family member's school for southern-bound cadres. In order to further take care of the study of your loved ones, it has been decided to provide full public funding for three months, half public funding for three months, and one-quarter supply for six months, for a total of one year of residence before graduation. It is also allowed to bring children under the age of five, and one child will receive one jin of wheat per day. The public also provides medical expenses. The school mainly focuses on learning textile technology, and also improves everyone politically and culturally. When school started, we personally went to your homes, partly to express our condolences and partly to mobilize your loved ones to participate in learning. After arriving at the school, in addition to learning some textile technology, everyone politically saw their bright future and overcame the temporary anxiety that arose after you left. Culturally, everyone learned dozens of words in more than a month, and the most learned seventy or eighty words. During the holidays, models were also selected, and the loved ones of comrades Zhang Ruqing and Zhang Jingyuan were elected as models for the whole school, and everyone was in a very good mood. We hope you can work with peace of mind in the front and work hard to help the poor people there to turn over. In the rear, we must cultivate them well so that they can be self-reliant, which is our gift to you."

    The students wrote many letters to their relatives. Wang Gaizhong said in her letter to Comrade Zhang Ruqing: "Comrade Ruqing: The village and district in our family are taking good care of us. The grain harvested in autumn is enough to eat, and the tobacco leaves alone sold for over 100,000, so there is no difficulty. Our Mao Sheng and Qiulan children are both in school in winter, and the third uncle was also elected as a model in the mutual aid group in autumn. Now the New Year's goods are all prepared. Three dou of wheat and two dou of corn have been milled, so there is no need to worry about anything at home. I came to the school on September 15th. At first, I didn't like it very much, but then it got better. I realized my future and decided to study hard, planning to learn skills when crossing the river so that I can be independent in life. I hope you will do a good job in the front and be a model. I will also study hard and work hard to move forward. And I wish you a happy New Year!"

    Sun Dongzhi said in her letter to Comrade Zhang Jingyuan: "Comrade Jingyuan: How are you? When I came to the school, I didn't know anyone at first, but later I got to know everyone. I felt that being with my classmates was like being at home. We are going to have a holiday for the New Year and go back. I will also prepare to learn to knit Western socks and belts, and continue to engage in production. Recently, I took a photo with the child, and it's very good. The child is chubby. When we can communicate, I will send it to you. Also, our family is doing well. The wheat has been planted early, so don't worry, and I hope you can help the poor people there to turn over."

    Du Yulin wrote in her letter to Comrade Liu Xianlu: "Comrade Xianlu: I have received your previous two letters, so don't worry. My illness is cured, and after autumn, I went to school. This time I am very at ease and determined to work hard, not like before! I hope you will pay attention to taking care of your health and strive for progress in your work."

    Zhang Hua'e said in her letter to Comrade Du Shuanghe: "Comrade Shuanghe: How is your health after crossing the river? Now the masses in our village are taking care of us very well, and the autumn harvest was not bad. My sister and I went to the school together. The principal and the teachers treat us very well, so don't worry. You can work with peace of mind in the front, and I will study hard in the back, so that we can be reunited in the future. I hope you can write to me."

    涉县干属学校学员年关写信
    希望南征的爱人们  好好帮助穷人翻身
    【太行消息】旧历年马上就到，涉县南下干部家属学校的学生们，纷纷给太行新华日报写信，让把她们的内心话，转告给远在南方的亲人。盼望他们在前方安心杀敌，好好帮助南边穷人翻身，争取早日打倒蒋介石。该校校长赵九洲与郝佩兰两同志的信上说：“南征干部同志们：从报上看到你们南下后的胜利消息，我们高兴极啦。你们都好吧！自你们走后，咱县的工读学校马上就改成了南下干部家属学校。为了更进一步照顾大家亲人的学习，特决定全公费三个月，半公费三个月，供给四分之一六个月，共住一年就毕业。还允许带五岁以下的小孩，一个小孩每天有一斤麦子。公家还给医药费。学校主要以学习纺织技术为主，并从政治上、文化上提高大家。开学时，我们亲自到你们的家里，一方面是慰问，一方面就动员大家的爱人参加学习。到校后，除学会些纺织技术外，每个人政治上看到了自己的光明前途，克服了你们走后一时产生的不安现象。文化上，一个多月每人都学了几十个字，最多的学会七八十个字。放假时，还评选了模范，张如庆和张景元同志的爱人当选了全校的模范，大家情绪都很好。望你们在前边放心工作，努力帮助那儿的穷人们翻身。我们在后方，一定要好好培养她们，使她们能自力更生，这就是我们慰问大家的礼物”。
    学生们给自己亲人写了好多信。王改仲给张如庆同志的信上说：“如庆同志：咱家村上区上照顾的都很好，秋天打的粮食很够吃，光烟叶就卖了十来万，啥都不困难。咱毛生和秋兰孩，冬天都上了学，三叔秋天在互助组里还当选了模范。现在过年的东西都准备好了，推了三斗麦，二斗玉茭，家里一切都不必挂念。我在九月十五就来了学校，开头有些不喜欢，后来就好啦，知道了自己将来的前途，才决心努力学习，打算在过河时学会本事，生活能独立。望你在前头好好干工作，作个模范，我也要好好学习做工，往前走。并祝你过年好！”
    孙东枝给张景元同志的信上说：“景元同志：你好吧？我来在学校，开头人生，后来都熟了，觉得和同学们在一块，和在家一样。俺们过年要放假回去了，我还要准备学织洋袜、织腰带，继续搞生产。最近，我和孩子照了个像，很好，孩子胖胖的，等能通了信，我就给你捎去。再告你，咱家人都好，麦子早种上啦，不用结计，望你好好帮助那里穷人翻身吧。”
    杜玉林给刘献禄同志的信内写着：“献禄同志：你前两次来信都收到了，不用结计。我的病已好了，过了秋天，我就到了学校。这一回很安心，决心努力，总不象以前那样！望你注意保养身体，努力工作进步。”
    张花娥给杜双河同志的信内说：“双河同志：你过河后，身体好哇？现在咱家村上群众照顾的很周到，秋也收的不赖。我和姐姐一同到了学校，校长和先生待我们很好，不用挂念，你在前头安心工作，我在后面好好学习，将来咱好团圆。希你能来信。”
