　　Correspondence
  　To the responsible comrade of the Wuxiang County Government:
　　Farmer Li Tujin of Sanwang Village, Wu'an, came to this newspaper on the 16th of this month, requesting to publish a statement about his marital problems. According to him, his wife married someone else in Wuxiang without a divorce. Because he has already reported his case to the Border Government, and the Border Government has notified you to reply within twenty days, the details of the whole case will not be published specifically. Li Tujin came to this newspaper after waiting for twenty days without a reply. Our opinion is that it would be best if you could quickly help him resolve this issue.

  　第十四号武乡县政府负责同志：
    武安三王村农民李土金，于本月十六日，来本社要求登报，申诉他的婚姻问题，据他谈称：他的老婆未经离婚即在武乡与别人结婚。因为他已将他的事告边府，而且边府也曾通知过你们在二十天内答复，因此关于全案详情不再专登。李土金来本社时是在等了二十天无答复之后来的，我们的意见是你们能迅速帮助他处理这个问题才好。
