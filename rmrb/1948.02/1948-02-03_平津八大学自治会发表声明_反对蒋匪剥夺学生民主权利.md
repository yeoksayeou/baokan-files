Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Delayed news: The student unions of eight universities in Beiping and Tianjin, including Tsinghua, Peking, Yenching, Sino-French, Beiping Normal College, Nankai, Peiyang, and Hebei Institute of Technology, issued a joint statement on December 28th of last year, opposing the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Education's "Revised Rules for Student Unions in Secondary and Higher Education Institutions," which is full of fascist stench and deprives students of their democratic rights. They demanded its immediate cancellation and called on all college students in the Chiang-controlled areas to "rise up together to fight for the right to self-government, to crush all attempts to enslave the youth, and to fight to defend the universities and human rights." The statement also denounced: "These rules show the (Chiang bandit) education authorities' new intention to further implement the enslavement education, marking a new stage of enslavement education," "Negatively, it attempts to restrict students' activities inside and outside the school, cut off the connection between youth students in schools, districts, and internationally, and isolate the exchange of feelings among young students." "Positively, it attempts to enable (Chiang party) training and management personnel to directly or indirectly manipulate and control the student unions," "to make young students into puppets that (Chiang bandits) authorities can manipulate freely, so as to achieve their goal of enslaving the youth." The statement firmly stated: "Autonomy is our basic right and will never be subject to any unreasonable restrictions." It demanded that the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Education "withdraw its order," otherwise it "will not accept it." At the same time, starting on December 26th, students at Nanjing Central University held a strike to protest the Chiang bandit's suppression of the student union's departmental representative conference activities and the expulsion of eight students. Despite the Chiang bandit's obstruction, they continued to hold student union elections and persisted in the strike until December 30th. This was the second strike by the school's students to resist the Chiang Party's oppression of student unions, the first being on November 26th of last year. It is reported that the Chiang bandit education authorities, shocked by the patriotic student movement in the Chiang-controlled areas last year, promulgated the so-called "Revised Rules for Student Unions in Secondary and Higher Education Institutions" to further suppress students. These "rules" stipulate that "the organization of student unions should be handled by the school's training department or teaching department, which should designate two to three students from each grade or department to first establish a preparatory committee," "The school principal and the person in charge of training shall be responsible for directing and supervising," and the Chiang bandit school authorities have the right to order the "removal" of student union directors elected by students at will, and even "dissolve" the student union. The student union cannot establish a representative conference, and all members can only hold two meetings at the beginning and end of each semester; and it stipulates that the student union "must not participate in various off-campus group activities, or have joint organizations between schools."

    平津八大学自治会发表声明
    反对蒋匪剥夺学生民主权利
    【新华社陕北一日电】迟到消息：平、津清华、北京、燕京、中法、北平师院、南开、北洋、河北工学院等八大学学生自治会，于年前十二月廿八日发表联合声明，反对蒋匪教育部充满法西斯臭味、剥夺学生民主权利的“修正中等以上学校学生自治会规则”，要求立即将其取消，并呼吁全蒋管区大学生“共同起来争自治的权利，粉碎一切奴化青年的意图，为保卫学府、保卫人权而奋斗”。声明中并痛斥：“这规则表明出（蒋匪）教育当局进一步实施奴化教育的新意图，标志着奴化教育的新阶段”，“消极方面，企图箝制同学们校内外的活动，割断校际、区际以及国际间青年学生的联系，隔离青年学生感情的交流”。“积极方面企图使各校（蒋党）训管人员直接或间接地操纵与把持自治会”，“要把青年学生造成（蒋匪）当局操纵自如的木偶，从而达到其奴化青年的目的”。该声明坚决表示：“自治是我们的基本权利，绝不受任何不合理的限制”。要求蒋匪教育部“收回成命”，否则即“不予接受”。与此同时，十二月二十六日起南京中央大学学生抗议蒋匪箝制自治会系科代表大会活动及开除学生八人而举行罢课，并不顾蒋匪阻挠，继续举行自治会选举，至十二月三十日仍坚持罢课中。此为该校学生反抗蒋党压迫学生自治会的第二次罢课，第一次系在去年十一月二十六日。按蒋匪教育当局震慑于去年蒋区学生爱国运动，为进一步压迫学生而颁布所谓“修正中等以上学校学生自治会规则”，该项“规则”规定“学生自治会之组织，应由学校训导处或教导处指定每年级或每院系学生二人至三人，先成立筹备会”，“由学校校长及主管训导人员负责指挥监督”，蒋匪学校当局有权随意令学生选出之自治会理事“退职”，甚至“解散”自治会，自治会不能设立代表大会，全体会员只能于每学期首尾举行两次；并规定自治会“不得参加校外各种团体活动，或有校与校间联合组织”。
