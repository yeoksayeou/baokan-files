    Anti-Bureaucracy Regulations
    In order to combat bureaucratic habits, to more effectively discover abuse of power, and to expose and eliminate undesirable civil servants who have infiltrated Soviet organs, the following regulations are hereby stipulated:
    Each Soviet organ, in order to allow everyone to enter without a pass, must post rules regarding dates and times for approaching the public not only inside the offices but also outside. The arrangement of the reception room must allow people to enter freely, without any pass whatsoever.
    Each Soviet organ must establish a visitor registration book, in order to record the name of the visitor, the main points of their opinion, and the matters discussed in the simplest possible form.
    Time for receiving people must also be stipulated on Sundays and holidays.
    When receiving people, personnel from the People's Commissariat of State Control have the right to be present and are responsible for inspecting receptions at any time, reviewing visitor registration books, and writing reports on inspections, reviews of visitor registration books, and public inquiries.
    The People's Commissariats of Labor, State Control, and Justice must establish inquiry bureaus everywhere—the office dates and times must be announced to the people, and at the same time, everyone can freely enter and exit without a pass or payment of fees—they must also be open on Sundays.
    These inquiry bureaus must not only answer all inquiries from the people—oral or written—but also provide free written petitions for those who are illiterate or cannot write clear petitions. (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 17, pages 197-198)

    反官僚主义条例
    为了反对官僚习气，为了更能有成效地发现滥用职权，并为了揭露和排除混入苏维埃机关里来的不良公务人员起见，特规定以下的条例：
    每个苏维埃机关，为了使人人不用通行证都可入内起见，不仅在办公室里面，而且在外面，均须张贴接近民众日期与时间的规则。会客室的布置，务须使人得自由入内，决不须任何通行证。
    每一个苏维埃机关，都须设置一本来宾登记簿，以便以最简略的形式，将来者姓名、意见要点及接洽事项登记下来。
    星期日及假日，亦须规定接见人民的时间。
    在接见人民时，国家监察人民委员部公务人员有权出席，并负有随时巡视接见，检阅来宾登记簿，编写关于巡视，检阅来宾登记簿，以及公共质问等报告之责务。
    劳动、国家监察、司法等人民委员部务须在各处设立问讯局——须将办公日期和时间，通告人民，同时，一切人皆可自由进出，无须通行证，亦不须交纳费用——即星期日亦须办公。
    这些问讯局不仅须答复人民的一切询问——口头的或书面的，并须替不识字者及不会写明白的陈诉书者，免费代写书面的陈诉书。（列宁选集第十七卷一九七——一九八页）
