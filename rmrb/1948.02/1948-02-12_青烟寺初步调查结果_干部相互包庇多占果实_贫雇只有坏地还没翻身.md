[Report by this newspaper] The investigation in Qingyansi Village, Wu'an, revealed that cadres were embezzling and seizing the fruits of labor, and arbitrarily oppressing the people. The masses deeply resented this and urgently demanded emancipation, democracy, and a change in this bad phenomenon. The investigation showed that cadre party members universally over-occupied the fruits of victory. Wang Qingtai, the political director (lower-middle peasant), bought a large mule for 15,000 yuan, a low price, obtained half a string of good houses, embezzled fifty to sixty *jin* of cotton yarn, and 1,700 *jin* of seed cotton. He also bought four *mu* of the best land in the village at a low price. Li Zengsheng, the chairman of the Farmers' Association (middle peasant), bribed the appraisers to exchange for half a string of good houses. Others who received houses were not given the trees, but he was exceptionally given the trees. He also took more bags, clothes, and quilts. He bought a donkey for 170,000 yuan and promised to lend Li Mazi 300,000 yuan to buy relief supplies. The masses reported that he and Wang also had a lot of savings in the cooperative, and they did not know where it came from. Many of the gold and silver jewelry and cash seized during the struggle were never distributed. When distributing the fruits of the harvest, all the good fruits were distributed to the cadres. The accounts for the fruits sold in the spring of the year before last and the autumn of last year were never announced. It was not until February of this year that it was announced that all the money had been deposited into the cooperative on behalf of the masses. The land, houses, trees, livestock, and this summer's fruits seized since the struggle were also sold at a price, but the accounts were not announced. Cadres in the village formed a small anti-people clique, acting arbitrarily and oppressing the masses. Anyone who had raised objections to the cadres was generally retaliated against. This spring, the political director and the chairman of the Farmers' Association incited the beating of Wang Gaoshou, a poor peasant activist, who died from his injuries because he had exposed the village's darkness to the district political commissar. During the "wiping black and washing faces" campaign, some of the masses who had raised objections were falsely accused of being spies, some were expelled from the Farmers' Association, and some were warned. The cadres were very unsympathetic to the difficulties of the orphans, widows, and poor hired peasants. Not only did they not distribute any fruit to the old widow Quanlai's wife and the lonely old man, Cai Erpi, they said, "Anyway, they will die soon, and after they die, the Farmers' Association will have to redistribute it."

The phenomenon of cadres covering up for each other is very serious. Li Dong, the former director of the cooperative, did not settle accounts for thirty-eight months. The masses repeatedly demanded a settlement, but in the end, he only produced 90,000 yuan, which greatly dissatisfied the masses. The masses and militiamen unanimously demanded the dismissal of Wang Tiantang, the militia captain, but in the end, he was not only not dismissed, but those who raised objections were threatened with being labeled counter-revolutionaries. Of the forty-four households of hired, poor, and middle peasants visited during the investigation, twenty-two were currently in the most difficult situation. One household lacked food, housing, and farm tools, three lacked food and housing, one lacked housing, clothing, and bedding, two lacked clothing, bedding, and farm tools, seven lacked food, five lacked housing, and three lacked farm tools. The land of the poor hired lower-middle peasants was fragmented, far away, and of poor quality. The most land-poor was Wang Jicun, whose family of three only had seven or eight *mu* of bad land. Today, these newly emancipated households, in addition to the fact that a few lack a lot in terms of quantity, mainly have problems with the quality of the land. The masses urgently demanded democracy. Even old women like Tao Shanniang, who are usually silent, feel that they have nowhere to express their suffering.

    青烟寺初步调查结果
    干部相互包庇多占果实
    贫雇只有坏地还没翻身
    【本报消息】武安青烟寺村调查中发现，干部贪污与多占果实，随便欺压人民，群众对此，甚为痛恨，他们迫切要求翻身，要求民主，要求改变这种坏现象。从调查中看：干部党员多占果实是相当普遍的，政治主任王庆泰（下中农）一万五千元贱买一匹大骡子，得了半串好院子，贪污花线有五六十斤，籽花一千七百斤，又贱买本村最好的地四亩。农会主任李增胜（中农）贿赂评议员换得半串好院子，别人分院不分树，他则例外的分了树，布袋、衣服、被子拿的都多。以十七万元买了毛驴一头，并答应借李麻子卅万元买救济物资。群众反映他二人在合作社的存款也很多，不知是从那里来的。斗出的许多金银首饰及现洋等均未见分过，分配果实时，所有好果实都分到干部名下。前年春天和去年秋天卖的果实，从未公布帐目，直至今年二月才宣布全部代群众入合作社。斗争以来的土地、房屋、树、牲口以及今夏的果实，也均作价卖出，帐目也未宣布。干部在本村形成一个反人民的小宗派，独断专行，欺压群众。凡对干部提过意见的，普遍受到打击。今春政治主任、农会主任等策动打贫雇积极分子王高寿，伤重而死，因他曾向区政委揭露本村黑暗。擦黑洗脸时，提过意见的群众有的被诬为特务，有的被开除农会，有的受到警告。干部们对孤寡贫雇的困难是极不体谅的。不但不分给老寡妇全来老婆和孤老汉才二劈果实。且说：“反正快死了，死了后还得给农会再分。”
    干部内部相互包庇的现象是很严重的，前合作社社长李栋，三十八个月未算帐，群众一再要求清算，最后只拿出九万元完事，群众极为不满。群众和民兵一致要求罢免民兵队长王天堂，最后不仅未罢免，并恐吓提意见的是反革命。在调查中访问过的四十四户雇贫中农中，目前最困难的就有廿二户，缺粮食、房子、农具者有一户，缺粮食、房子的有三户，缺房子、衣被的一户，缺衣被及农具的二户。缺粮者七户，缺房者五户，缺农具者三户。贫雇下中农的土地，又碎、又远、又坏。最缺地的如王继存，三口人才有七、八亩坏地。这些新翻身户，今天对土地的要求，除少数在数量上差得很多的外，主要的还是质量问题。群众迫切要求民主，即便是老婆婆如桃善娘这种素不吭气的人，也感到自己的苦处没处提。
