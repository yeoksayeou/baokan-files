    After a Scoundrel Removed as Leader,
    Production at Shuimo Bay Improves
    [Tangyin News] The refugee production at Shuimo Bay initially had the scoundrel and villain Jiao Xikui in charge. He was the militia captain, had served as a puppet soldier, and shot at working personnel in the dark. He ate and drank lavishly every day, issuing orders left and right. The refugees were oppressed and dared not make a sound, and production couldn't get off the ground. In fifty-five days, he ate up all 6,000 catties of grain and 400,000 yuan that they had brought, and also sold fourteen head of livestock, spending most of the money. Later, after conducting class investigation, the refugees accused and removed Jiao Xikui, and production immediately picked up. Thirteen people organized themselves to weave mats, making twenty-five mats a day. From December 21st to January 15th, they wove more than 600 mats, earning a total of 249,000 yuan. Adding the income from hauling coal, they earned a total of 777,000 yuan. After deducting expenses for the entire village and twenty-six livestock, there was still a surplus of 42,000 yuan, enough to buy 800 catties of rice, which is enough for seventy-one people to eat for ten days.

    换了流氓掌权人
    水磨湾生产搞好了
    【汤阴消息】水磨湾的难民生产，开始是流氓坏蛋焦希魁掌了大权，他是民兵队长，曾当过伪军，打过工作员黑枪。他每天大吃大喝，指东划西，难民被压迫的不敢啃声，生产也搞不起来。出来五十五天，将带来的粮食六千斤，洋四十万元全都吃光，还卖了十四头牲口，大部钱也花完了。后来进行了查阶级，难民控诉与撤换了焦希魁，生产立刻起了劲。十三个人组织起来编席子，每天能编二十五个，从十二月二十一号，到元月十五号，编席六百多领，共赚了二十四万九千多元。加上拉煤的收入，共赚七十七万七千多元。除全村人和二十六个牲口开支，还剩了四万二千多元，能买八百斤米，还够七十一人十天吃。
