Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd—The Northwest People's Liberation Army, in its winter training, emphasizes the study of ideology, organization, and methods, striving to be practical and implement the strategic policy of focusing on eliminating the enemy. One unit identified the following shortcomings in technical training: (1) Superficiality; whoever shouts loudly, gets up early, and takes off their clothes to train is considered good, or haggling over whether you have progressed a few meters or my movements are more skilled, while neglecting basic issues such as grenade throwing techniques, resulting in formalism. (2) Only the duty platoon leader provides training, and the company-level cadres do not participate, so the training organization remains the same as before. (3) Poor methods; grenade throwing only seeks distance, not technique; bayonet practice only focuses on movements, not aiming at the target; shooting only achieves aiming from a support, neglecting the mental actions of raising the gun and gripping it. After inspection, the unit has gradually corrected these issues. One unit, in its training, called for the idea of thoroughly and completely eliminating the enemy to be implemented in learning, educating soldiers to actively deploy our firepower or change formations under enemy fire, cultivating the idea of resolutely and tenaciously suppressing the enemy. Another unit's tactical training teaching method progresses from segmented to coherent, studying while doing, immediately correcting errors, and comparing good and bad examples. Research and discussions are conducted in a democratic spirit, giving full play to everyone's wisdom and talents.

　　西北我军冬季练兵
  　重视思想建设
    【新华社西北二十二日电】西北人民解放军冬季练兵中，重视研究思想组织及方法，力求切合实际，贯彻以消灭敌人为主的战略方针，某部检查出技术练兵中的缺点：（一）只看表面，谁喊得响起得早脱掉衣服练就算好，或斤斤计较你进步几米我动作熟练，而忽略了投弹要领等基本问题，流于形式主义。（二）只靠值星排长教练，连级干部不参加，练兵组织还是老一套。（三）方法不好，投弹只求远近，不求要领，刺枪单讲动作，不注意刺中目标，射击只做到架上瞄准，忽略举枪握枪精神动作等问题。经检查后该部已逐步纠正。某部在练兵中号召要把干脆彻底消灭敌人的思想贯彻到学习中去，教育战士在敌人火力下积极布置我们的火力，或改变队形的方法，养成坚决顽强压制敌人的思想。另部战术练兵的教学方法上，是由分段到连贯，边作边研究，即时纠正错误以及好坏对比。以民主精神进行研究和讨论，发挥了每个人的才智。
