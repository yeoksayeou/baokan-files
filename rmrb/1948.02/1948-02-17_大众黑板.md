    ★ The people in the newly liberated areas of Henan spent their first happy New Year, and they affectionately paid New Year's respects to Chairman Mao's portrait.
    ★ The Taiyue and Taihang participating teams that followed Chen Xie's army across the Yellow River to fight the Chiang bandits have returned. They helped the army fight and helped the people of Henan to stand up, and they have made great contributions.
