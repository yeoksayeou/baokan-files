Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Moscow dispatch: While the northern and central parts of the Soviet Union are still in the grip of severe cold, spring has already arrived in the southern Soviet Union. The republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldavia have successively begun large-scale spring plowing campaigns, with millions of hectares of land already sown with wheat and barley. To achieve even greater harvests, collective farmers have reclaimed vast tracts of virgin land, with many previously barren lands producing grain for the first time this year. As of now, the collective farms in southern Ukraine have cultivated over 780,000 hectares more land than in 1940. The slogan "Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years," proposed by workers, has been enthusiastically embraced by farmers. Many collective farms have made guarantees and are engaging in mutual challenges and competitions. Ample snowfall throughout the Soviet Union last winter has provided sufficient moisture to the soil, and winter crops across the country are forecasting a bumper harvest. Soviet farmers will receive 2.3 times more agricultural machinery this year than last year. Aerial fertilization and pest control work will also be greatly expanded. Rural electrification achieved significant success last year. According to incomplete statistics, at least 3,100 new rural power stations were built, providing electricity to 5,816 collective farms and 914 machine tractor stations, thus saving 4.5 million workdays. Certain regions, such as the entire rural area of Sverdlovsk Oblast, were completely electrified last year. Electrification will proceed at an even faster pace this year, all of which will guarantee a new bumper harvest this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Moscow dispatch: The Central Administration of Civil Aviation of the Soviet Union recently announced a summary of agricultural aviation work for 1947, stating that the total volume of agricultural aviation work last year exceeded that of the previous year by two times, achieving remarkable success in fertilization and pest control. Last year, aircraft were used for the first time to spread fertilizer on winter crops, and the results proved that the harvest in the fertilized areas was greatly increased. Agricultural aircraft also helped 2,000 collective farms in Ukraine to eliminate sugar beet pests by spraying pesticide powder from the air, completely saving the region's sugar beets from destruction. In addition, aircraft were also used to spray powder to aid cotton harvesting. The leaves of cotton sprayed with the powder fell off completely ahead of schedule, and the cotton bolls also cracked open earlier, making machine cotton picking possible and increasing the rate of manual cotton picking by 18 to 20 percent. (According to reports, the Soviet Union used cotton picking machines for the first time last year, with an efficiency equivalent to 40 manual laborers, surpassing American-made cotton picking machines.) The application of agricultural aviation in these areas will be greatly expanded this year.

    苏联南部九个共和国
    开始大规模春耕
    广泛用飞机撒肥除虫
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科讯：当苏联北部与中部尚在苦寒之时，在苏联南部，春天却已经到来。土耳克曼、乌兹别克、塔吉克、卡萨克斯坦、乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、亚美尼亚、乔治亚、摩尔达维亚诸共和国，已先后开始了大规模的春耕运动，数百万公顷的土地已播种了小麦与大麦。集体农民为求得更多收获，已开垦了大量处女地，许多过去的荒地上，今年将首次生产粮食。乌克兰南部集体农场，截至目前止，耕地已超过一九四○年耕地七十八万公顷，由工人提出的“四年完成五年计划”的口号，已获得农民的热烈响应。许多集体农场已提出保证，并互相挑战，展开竞赛。去冬全苏降雪充足，土壤获得了足够水分，各地冬季作物已预告丰收。全苏农民今年将获得比去年多二点三倍的农业机器。而航空撒肥及除虫工作等也将大加展开。农村电气化，在去年获得重大成就，据不完全统计，新建农村电力站至少三千一百所，可供应五千八百十六个集体农场与九百十四个机器拖拉机站以电力，因而节省了四百五十万个工作日。若干地区如斯维特洛夫斯克州的全部农村，去年已完全电气化。今年电气化将以更高速度前进，这一切将保证今年新的丰收。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联民用航空中央管理局，顷公布一九四七年农业航空工作总结称：去年农航工作总量超过前年两倍，在撒肥、除虫方面，已获卓越成就。去年首次对冬季作物试用飞机播撒肥料，结果证明施肥地区收获大为提高。农业飞机又帮助乌克兰二千集体农场清除甜菜根害虫而在上空撒下药粉，完全挽救了该区甜菜免于毁灭。此外，飞机还被用来撒布药粉，帮助棉花摘收，为药粉撒到的棉花，叶子就先期脱落净尽，棉桃亦提前裂开，因而使机器摘棉成为可能，并使人工摘棉速率提高百分之十八至二十。（按去年苏联首次使用摘棉机，其效率等于四十个人工，超过美国制摘棉机。）今年农业航空在这些方面的应用将大力扩展。
