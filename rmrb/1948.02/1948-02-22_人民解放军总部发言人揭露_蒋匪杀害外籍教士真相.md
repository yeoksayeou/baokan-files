Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—The spokesman for the People's Liberation Army Headquarters today announced the truth about the killing of three foreign missionaries in Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province on January 7th, stating: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from the Chiang Kai-shek propaganda organ on January 13th, "The US Embassy spokesman announced on the 13th: On January 7th, American female missionaries Nordin's group, Anderson's group, and a Finnish doctor named Brook were murdered by bandits between Xiangyang and Jingmen in Hubei Province." After investigation by our Headquarters, it has been verified that this was done by Ma Xinqi, the director of the Five-Township Joint Defense Office of Zhongxiang, Hubei, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit. The bandit Ma Xinqi dispatched troops at noon on January 7th to rob a vehicle in Kujiawan, Lishan Township, Zhongxiang, killing three foreign missionaries, two women and one man, and looting a great deal of property. This matter is well known to the local people. The People's Liberation Army eliminated this scourge for the people and encircled and annihilated the bandit Ma Xinqi on January 30th. The spokesman pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, on the one hand, instructed its bandits to rob and kill foreign missionaries, impersonating our People's Liberation Army, attempting to slander the reputation of our great People's Liberation Army; on the other hand, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits instigated their propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, to spread rumors that the despicable act of robbing and killing innocent foreign missionaries was committed by the People's Liberation Army, which is extremely shameless. The spokesman pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek has now appointed Kang Ze as the director of the so-called Fourteenth Pacification Zone, responsible for the defense of the northern Hubei area. Kang Ze is one of the well-known heads of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent bandits, the former head of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, and has served as the leader of a special anti-communist task force. Ma Xinqi is under the command of Kang Ze. This incident makes the background of the killing of three innocent foreign missionaries in Zhongxiang even more obvious. The spokesman also pointed out that reactionaries among the American Catholic Church, such as Father An Leishan, are echoing the Chiang Kai-shek special agent bandits, spreading rumors that the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army plan to eliminate the Catholic faith in North China in 1948. It is evident that using religious issues as a topic to spread rumors and slander the great cause of national independence and democratic liberation of the Chinese people is a part of the common conspiracy of American imperialist elements and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The policy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army towards foreigners in China is to require them to obey the laws of the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army and not to engage in illegal activities. As long as they can do so, the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army will protect them. Freedom of religious belief is one of the established policies of the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army, and there is absolutely no reason to kill peaceful foreign missionaries. If foreigners in China commit illegal acts, such as helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign imperialists against the Chinese people, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the People's Liberation Army, after verification, except for those who are armed and participate in the anti-people civil war, who should be treated as war objects by the People's Liberation Army, other criminals should be tried by the democratic government, given appropriate treatment according to the severity of their circumstances, and the reasons for the judgment and treatment should be publicly announced. It is absolutely not a matter of randomly killing them. The act of killing innocent foreign missionaries in Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province, can only be done by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Indeed, they have done so. The Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are opposed to such despicable acts.

　　人民解放军总部发言人揭露
  　蒋匪杀害外籍教士真相
    【新华社陕北二十日电】人民解放军总部发言人，今日宣布一月七日湖北钟祥县境内三个外籍传教士被杀之真相称：据蒋匪宣传机关中央社一月十三日电称：“美大使馆发言人十三日宣称：一月七日美国女传教士诺德兰小组、安德逊小组及另一芬兰籍医生布格于湖北襄阳及荆门间为匪徒杀害等语”。兹经本军总部查明，此系蒋匪湖北钟祥五乡联防办事处主任马馨起所为，该匪马馨起曾派出部队于一月七日中午，在钟祥丽山乡苦家湾劫车一辆，打死外籍教士三人，二女一男，并劫去财物甚多，此事为该地人民所周知。人民解放军为民除害，已于一月三十日将该匪马馨起包围歼灭。发言人指出蒋介石匪帮一方面指使其匪徒劫杀外国传教士，曾冒充我人民解放军，企图诬蔑我伟大的人民解放军的名誉；另一方面蒋匪又嗾使其宣传机关中央社大肆造谣，谓该项劫杀外国无辜传教士的卑鄙行为，系人民解放军所为，显系无耻已极。发言人指出：蒋介石现派康泽为所谓第十四绥靖区主任，负责鄂北地区之防务。康泽是著明的蒋介石特务匪徒的头子之一，过去三民主义青年团的负责人，当过专门反共的别动队的领导人，马馨起则在康泽指挥之下。此事使外籍无辜传教士三人在钟祥被杀的背景更为明显。发言人又指出美国天主教中之反动派如安乐山神父等，正与蒋介石特务匪徒互相唱和，放出谣言，谓中国共产党、中国民主政府与中国人民解放军，拟于一九四八年内绝灭华北之天主教信仰。足见以宗教问题为题目，造谣污蔑中国人民伟大的民族独立与民主解放的事业，乃是美国帝国主义分子与蒋介石匪帮的共同阴谋的一部分。中国共产党、中国民主政府与中国人民解放军，对于在华外国人的政策，是要求他们服从民主政府与人民解放军的法令，勿作犯法事务，只要他们能够如此，民主政府与人民解放军即予保护。信教自由是民主政府与人民解放军的既定政策之一，决无杀害和平的外国传教士之理。在华外国人中如有犯法行为，例如帮助蒋介石匪帮及外国帝国主义者，反对中国人民、中国民主政府及人民解放军查明属实者，除手执武器，参加反人民内战的人们，应由人民解放军当作战争对象处理者外，其他犯罪分子，应由民主政府审判，依其情节轻重，予以恰如其分的处理，并公开宣布判处理由，决不是随便予以杀害，象湖北钟祥县杀害外国无辜传教士的行为，只有国民党反动派方才做得出，果然他们就这样做了，中国共产党、中国民主政府与中国人民解放军是反对这类卑鄙行为的。
