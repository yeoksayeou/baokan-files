Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to various sources: On the 29th, the Chiang bandit authorities in Shanghai orchestrated military police and cavalry to brutally suppress the just anti-oppression movement of students from Tongji University and other schools, stabbing, beating, and arresting as many as 150 to 160 students from Tongji, Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and St. John's Universities. Earlier, in mid-January, the Kuomintang training department of Tongji University suppressed the student union and expelled eleven students, arousing the common indignation of Tongji students. After repeatedly requesting the school to retract the order without success, they could no longer tolerate it and went on strike starting on the 18th, deciding to collectively petition in Nanjing on the 29th. After learning of this, Wu Guozhen, the Chiang bandit mayor, traitor, and fascist bandit, sent police chief Yu Shude and others twice on the evening of the 28th to intimidate them, but the students' will was firm and they were unmoved.

On the morning of the 29th, Tongji students gathered at the Meilu Engineering College, along with students from Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and St. John's Universities who came to support the just actions of the Tongji students, totaling 5,000 people (Associated Press). Just as the students were about to depart for the railway station, the Chiang bandits had already dispatched dozens of armored vehicles and over 3,000 fully armed military police and secret agents (Reuters) to surround the school gate, preventing the students from taking a single step out. The Chiang bandit mayor Wu Guozhen personally went to threaten them, forcing the students to stop the petition. The students insisted on not yielding. By the afternoon, the Chiang bandit military police, who had been lying in wait outside the school, under the command of the Shanghai Garrison Commander, bandit Xuan Tiewu, used bayonets and broadswords to beat, stab, and arrest unarmed students; at night, they rushed into the dormitories to search and arrest people. According to Agence France-Presse, the Chiang bandits "arrested 120 students," and United Press said "30 to 40 students were beaten." Although the Shanghai Chiang bandit authorities concealed the number of students beaten, they also admitted to arresting 97 students from various schools.

In addition to suppressing students with violence, the Chiang bandits also instigated their puppet Shanghai Municipal Council and Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue circular telegrams, demanding that the Chiang bandits severely punish "illegal students." Hang Liwu, the Chiang bandit's Deputy Minister of Education, also rushed to Shanghai from Nanjing on the evening of the 29th with a "dissolution order," claiming that Tongji University would be "dissolved." The bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek personally issued a "handwritten order," clamoring to "eliminate" the student forces in various universities and specialized colleges who were participating in the anti-oppression struggle, attempting to use this to continue persecuting students and coercing students to resume classes.

This shocking atrocity has aroused great indignation among students and the general public in Shanghai. The anti-oppression sentiments of students from Tongji, Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and St. John's Universities have become even more intense.

    上海同济交通复旦等校学生
    英勇反抗蒋匪压迫
    军警捕杀学生百余引起人民更大激愤
    【新华社陕北一日电】据各方消息：上海蒋匪当局，二十九日策动军警、马队残酷镇压同济大学等校学生正义的反压迫运动，刺伤殴伤及逮捕同济、交通、复旦、暨南及圣约翰等校学生竟达一百五六十人之多。先是，一月中旬，同济大学蒋党训导处压迫学生自治会，并开除学生十一名，激起同济学生的共愤，数度要求校方收回乱命无效，乃忍无可忍于十八日起实行罢课，并决定于二十九日集体赴南京请愿。蒋匪市长卖国贼法西斯匪徒吴国桢获悉后，于二十八日晚派警察局长俞匪叔平等两度前往恫吓，但学生意志坚决，不为所动。
    廿九日晨，同济学生集中其美路工学院，连同支持该校学生正义行动前往送行之交通、复旦、暨南及圣约翰等校学生人数共达五千人（美联社）。正当学生启程赴车站之际，蒋匪早已出动装甲车数十辆、全副武装军警特务三千余名（路透社）包围校门，不让学生外出一步，蒋匪市长吴国桢并亲自前往威吓，强迫学生停止请愿，学生坚持不屈，至当日下午，预伏校外的蒋匪军警随即在沪市警备司令宣匪铁吾指挥之下，以刺刀、大刀、殴刺和逮捕徒手学生；入夜又冲入宿舍肆行搜查、逮捕。据法新社报导蒋匪“捕去学生一百二十人”，合众社说“殴伤学生三、四十人”。上海蒋匪当局虽隐没殴伤学生数目，但亦承认捕去各校学生九十七人。
    蒋匪除以暴力镇压学生外，并唆使其御用的所谓上海市参议会、市商会等，发表通电，要求蒋匪对“不法学生”严予惩处。蒋匪教育部次长杭立武亦于廿九日晚携“解散令”由南京赶往上海，声称将“解散”同济大学，匪首蒋介石并亲自发出“手令”，扬言将“消灭”各大学及专科学院参加反压迫斗争的学生势力，企图借此继续迫害学生并威迫学生复课。
    此一震动全国的暴行，已引起沪市学生及广大市民万分激愤。同济、交通、复旦、暨南及圣约翰等校学生反压迫情绪更趋激昂。
