    A Popular Newspaper Serving the Broad Masses of Farmers
    Subscription Method for the New Dazhong (Masses) Daily
    Since the New Dazhong Daily changed its format, it has been welcomed by farmer comrades in various regions. There have been requests for the newspaper to be published more times a month. Although the manpower of this newspaper is limited, in order to meet the demands, it has been decided that starting from March, the newspaper will be published every five days, six issues per month. The new subscription method is as follows:
    1. The newspaper will still be subscribed to on a monthly basis, at 350 yuan per copy per month, postage included.
    2. Local post offices can handle subscriptions. When subscribing, please inform the post office of your name and address (village), and pay the subscription fee. The newspaper will be mailed to you quickly as soon as it is published.
    Farmers' associations and poor peasant leagues in various regions are welcome to promote subscriptions. Please provide us with any opinions on the content and distribution of the newspaper so that we can improve our work.

    为广大农民服务的通俗报纸
    新大众报预定办法
    新大众改报以来，受到各地农民同志的欢迎，要求报纸一月多出几期，本报人力虽有限制，为满足要求，决定自三月份起，报纸五天出一期，一月出六期，新的预定办法是：
    一、报纸还是按月预定，每月每份三百五十元，不收邮费。
    二、各地邮局都可代定，预定时请将你的姓名住地（村）告知邮局，并交够报费，报纸一出，就很快的寄给你。
    欢迎各地区村里的农会，贫农团多多介绍预定。对报纸内容发行上有什么意见，请提给我们，以便改进工作。
