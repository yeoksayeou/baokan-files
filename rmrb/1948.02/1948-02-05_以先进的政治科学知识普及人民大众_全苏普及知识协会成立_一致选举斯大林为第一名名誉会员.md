    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: The All-Soviet Association for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, which has been in preparation for more than half a year since last summer, convened its first representative assembly in Moscow last month and successfully concluded on the 28th of last month. Scientists, politicians, artists, writers, and political and social leaders from various regions attending the conference fully discussed the following question: how to popularize advanced political and scientific knowledge among the people to help the Soviet people accelerate the completion of the Five-Year Plan. A consensus plan of action was reached at the meeting. The conference unanimously elected Stalin as the first honorary member, honoring him as a great politician, thinker, and scientist of our time. Molotov and Zhdanov were also unanimously elected as honorary members. The proposer solemnly pointed out: Molotov is an authoritative theorist of socialist economics and praised his "brilliant achievements in foreign policy and his achievement of popularizing international law into a science that every worker and peasant can master." Zhdanov is an outstanding representative of Marxism-Leninism theory and a great fighter on the ideological front of the proletariat. The Truth Daily's editorial on the 27th commented: "The association will spread the Marxist-Leninist worldview to the masses and help the Soviet people properly understand the current international situation, enabling them to see how the strength of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp is growing." The News Daily pointed out: Raising the level of knowledge of the Soviet people will enable Soviet workers to continuously enrich their technical equipment, which is beneficial to the improvement of labor productivity. This is a typical characteristic of the socialist economy and an important measure to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years.
