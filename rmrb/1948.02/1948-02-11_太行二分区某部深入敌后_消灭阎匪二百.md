    Taihang Second Military Subdistrict Unit Penetrates Deep Behind Enemy Lines
    Eliminates 200 Yan Bandits
    [Taihang News] A unit of the Second Military Subdistrict achieved a victory by penetrating deep behind enemy lines in Taigu, eliminating over 200 Yan bandits. On the 3rd of this month, a certain unit of the military subdistrict and the Taigu Battalion penetrated deep behind enemy lines and ambushed the area of Sigua, Xinzhuang, and Huian, more than ten li southeast of Taigu. A small detachment was sent to Xincun to lure the enemy. On the morning of the 4th, two battalions, totaling over 700 men, of the 8th Column of Yan bandits stationed in Taigu City came out and advanced towards Sigua and Xinzhuang in three routes. After the enemy's vanguard entered our ambush zone, we immediately charged and killed them, completely wiping out an enemy infantry platoon. At this time, another unit of ours ambushed in Huian and Xinzhuang also attacked from behind the enemy, launching a two-pronged attack from inside and outside. The enemy was immediately thrown into disarray, dropping their heavy weapons in terror and fleeing back to Taigu City. At this time, more than 150 Yan bandit police corps from the city rushed to reinforce them, but upon seeing the unfavorable situation, they also turned around and fled. We pursued them fiercely until north of Huian, where the two defeated forces converged and counterattacked us three times, but were all defeated by us. In this battle, over 150 Yan bandits were killed or wounded, and 46 were captured alive. We seized two mortars, one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, twenty-five rifles, 3,487 rounds of various bullets, forty-seven artillery shells, fifteen bombs, two boxes of heavy machine gun parts, six pack mules, and many other items.
