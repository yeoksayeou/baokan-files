Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin Cha Ji] 27th Dispatch: The land reform in the old revolutionary base area of Pingshan, Jin察冀 [Jin Cha Ji], has created a paradigm for combining party rectification with mass mobilization. A brief introduction of its experience is provided below for study and reference by various regions.

Pingshan County is a region comprised of both semi-old areas liberated for two and a half years and old areas liberated for over ten years. In the old areas, rent and interest reduction were implemented during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the semi-old areas, there was a fierce anti-traitor liquidation campaign after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, both the old and semi-old areas have undergone land reform and review movements. The new rich-middle peasant economy has gained a considerable advantage, and the proportion of poor and hired peasants has relatively decreased. In the old areas, landless and land-poor peasants generally only account for 30 to 40 percent, while those who truly lack land, especially good land and land near their homes, only account for about 20 percent. In the semi-old areas, landless and land-poor peasants only account for about 40 percent. The landlords and rich peasants who occupy more and better land are almost all from the families of party members and cadres, and non-party figures in the Three-thirds System. Although old rich peasants own more land than the landlords who have been struggled against, they own less than the new rich peasants and even the wealthy middle peasants. Many rural party branches have been infiltrated by landlord-rich elements and gangsters, turning party branches into sectarian cliques, committing wrongdoing, and oppressing the masses, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, this land reform is not only a social issue but also a party issue. Before properly addressing this issue and finding concrete solutions, the following deviations occurred: First, the masses spontaneously rose up to struggle against bad party members and cadres. In many areas, some party members and cadres have been arrested and beaten, causing panic among general party members and cadres. Second, the landlords and rich peasants who have been attacked are scheming to take the opportunity to retaliate, inciting the masses to indiscriminately struggle against party members and cadres. Third, the work teams mechanically insist on struggling against landlords first before solving the cadre problem, forcibly separating the resolution of land issues from the democratic movement; or they prevent the masses from struggling against party members and cadres; or they treat a large number of party members and cadres opposed by the masses as "stones" to be moved away, causing a situation of detachment from the masses. Fourth, the work teams use their power to emphasize that the masses should struggle again against the landlords they have already struggled against, attempting to create a so-called "high tide" and manufacture so-called "vigorous" movements, which inevitably leads to "leftist" errors.

After Pingshan combined land reform with the party rectification and democratic movement, it created valuable experience in mobilizing the masses to equally distribute land in the old liberated areas. The main form of combining land reform with party rectification was initially to make the party branch public, conduct party rectification with the assistance of the broad masses, and combine party meetings with mass meetings. Secondly, a system of people's congresses was established from the township to the county level, and all powers were granted to them. Initially, the branch also closed its doors to investigate class background, work style, and eliminate sectarianism. However, after seven or eight sessions, it proved ineffective. Later, the doors were opened, first to absorb non-party poor peasants, and then to absorb non-party middle peasants. The meetings were attended by twenty or thirty party members and seventy or eighty non-party peasants, changing the secretive nature of rural branch meetings in the past. Finally, the obstacles that bad elements had erected to isolate our party from the masses were broken, allowing the class ideology, work style, and behavior of each party member to be clarified under the scrutiny of the masses, and the masses to propose opinions on how to deal with good and bad party members, which the branch immediately accepted. Those who should be rewarded were immediately rewarded, and those who should be punished were immediately punished. All bad elements could only reform themselves, and all small factions would immediately disintegrate. These meetings sometimes continued for twenty-four hours, and the masses were unwilling to adjourn, demonstrating the intensity of their emotions. The masses believe that as long as the party no longer protects its own members, and the cadres accept the opinions, punishments, and education of the masses, they have no worries and will stand with the party. They said, "Now we can communicate with Chairman Mao, and it has become a true Chairman Mao party." Therefore, making rural parties public and accepting mass opinions to transform and educate party members is not a simple technical issue, but a serious political issue. Due to the past secrecy of rural parties, bad elements were able to sever the connection between the party's leaders and the masses. Today, making the party public in the old liberated areas is an important key to improving our party's relationship with the masses. This democratic movement of party rectification has the following benefits: First, this is a party branch congress, which emphasizes reasoning and investigating facts. The non-party peasants who are invited to participate are respected by the party and have full rights to speak, testify, and offer opinions. Therefore, non-party peasants also doubly respect the leadership of the party. In general mass meetings, the emotions of some peasants who are venting their anger, retaliating, scolding, and randomly beating people will naturally be replaced by the spirit of treating illness and saving people, criticizing, and offering opinions. Moreover, because the party promptly criticizes and punishes the bad party members and cadres they oppose at the meeting, and rewards and promotes the good party members and cadres they support, the masses not only have the opportunity to fully express their grievances against certain party members and cadres, but also can obtain satisfactory solutions. Under the leadership of the party, it is possible to break away from the passive state of general mass meetings and obtain the possibility of actively handling internal party problems in a way that both mobilizes the masses and takes care of party members and cadres. In this way, party members and cadres can also sincerely accept criticism and automatically correct their mistakes, which has a profound educational significance for both party members and cadres and the broad masses. Second, because such a branch congress has the participation of the broad masses and full rights of criticism, it has the pressure of a mass meeting, making it impossible to hide, deceive, or quibble about any mistakes. In addition, with strong leadership that can understand the overall situation, carefully analyze problems, and give the criticized cadres the opportunity to speak and reason, explaining that some of their mistakes are the responsibility of the higher levels, who can then testify for them, it is possible to distinguish responsibilities, so that all problems can be resolved in a realistic and truthful manner, avoiding the masses' simple and one-sided observation of the shortcomings of party members and cadres. Third, using this method of combining internal party mobilization and persuasion with the democratic forces of the masses to get rural party members and cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds to hand over land and property will also be more appropriate than simply handing them over to mass meetings for struggle.

　　平山老解放区土改经验
  　创造整党与发动群众相结合的范例
    【新华社晋察冀二十七日电】晋察冀平山老解放区土改中，创造了整党与发动群众相结合的范例，兹特扼要介绍其经验供各地研究参考。
    平山县是一个包括解放了两年半的半老区和解放了十年以上的老区的地区。在老区，经过了抗战中的减租减息，在半老区则经过了抗战胜利后激烈的反奸清算；但不论在老区和半老区又都经过了土改和复查运动。新的富中农经济已占相当优势，贫雇农的比例已相对减缩。在老区，无地和少地的农民一般的只占百分之三十到四十，真正缺地，特别缺乏好地和近地的农民，则只占百分之二十左右。在半老区，无地和少地的农民，亦只占百分之四十左右。而占有较多和较好土地的地主富农，则差不多全是党员干部的家庭，和三三制的党外人士。旧富农虽拥有比斗争过的地主较多的土地，但比新富农甚至比富裕中农还少。不少农村党又混进了地富分子和流氓分子，把党的支部变为宗派小集团，为非作歹，欺压群众，造成了广大群众的不满情绪。因而此次土地改革，不仅是一个社会问题，同时也是一个党内问题。在没有适当处理这种问题并找到具体解决问题的办法前，就发生了以下各种偏向：第一，是群众自动起来斗争坏的党员干部。在不少地区，已有一些党员干部被捕、被打，造成一般党员干部中的惊慌。第二，是已受打击的地主富农阴谋乘机报复，煽动群众对党员干部胡乱斗争。第三，是工作团机械的坚持先斗地主再解决干部问题，硬把解决土地问题和民主运动机械分开；或者制止群众对党员干部的斗争；或者将群众反对的大批党员干部当作“石头”搬走，造成脱离群众的情况。第四，是工作团利用权力，强调群众对斗过的地主再来斗争，企图掀起所谓“高潮”，制造所谓“轰轰烈烈”，结果必然要犯“左”的错误。
    平山把土地改革与整党民主运动结合起来以后，创造了老解放区发动群众平分土地的宝贵经验。土改同整党结合的主要形式，开初就是公开党的支部，在广大群众援助下进行整党，把党的会议与群众大会合而为一。其次，就是从乡到县建立了人民代表大会的系统，并赋予一切权力。开始时，支部也是关门查阶级、查作风及消灭宗派。但是开了七八次，均无效。后来把门打开，首先吸收非党贫农参加，接着吸收非党中农也参加。参加会议党员二三十人，非党农民七八十人，改变了过去农村支部开会时那种神秘性。最后，打破了坏分子隔离我党与群众联系的障碍，使得每个党员的阶级思想作风行为，在群众对证下，受到查清，并由群众提出处理好坏党员的意见，支部当即接受，该奖者立即奖励，该罚者马上处罚，一切坏分子只有改过自新，一切小宗派就会立即瓦解。这种会有时连续进行二十四小时，群众都不愿散会，情绪之热烈，可见一斑。群众认为，只要党不再包庇自己的党员，干部接受群众的意见、处分、教育，就没有任何顾虑的和党站在一起了。他们说：“这下可与毛主席通气了，可成了真毛主席党了。”因此，农村党的公开，并接受群众意见改造、教育党员，不是简单的技术问题，而是严重的政治问题。由于过去农村党的秘密，使得坏分子把党的领导者与群众的联系隔断了，今天在老解放区公开党是改善我们党与群众关系的重要关键。这种整党的民主运动，有以下几种好处：第一、这是党的支部大会，是讲道理查事实的，被邀参加的非党农民，受到党的尊重，有充分讲话、证明、提意见的权利，因此非党农民也就加倍尊重党的领导。在一般群众大会上，某些农民那种出气报复、漫骂乱打的情绪，自然会被治病救人批评提意见的精神所代替。而且由于党在会上及时的批评和处分了他们所反对的坏的党员干部，奖励和提拔了他们所拥护的好的党员干部，使得非党群众对党员干部的某些积怨，不仅有机会充分申诉，而且能得到满意的解决。而在党的领导上，又能摆脱一般群众大会上的被动状态，而获得了既能发动群众又能照顾党员干部的两全其美的主动处理党内问题的可能。这样，党员干部也能诚恳接受批评，自动改正错误，对党员干部以及对广大群众的教育意义都较深刻。第二、这样的支部大会，由于有广大的非党群众参加，与充分的批评权利，因此就具有群众大会的压力，使得任何错误都无法隐瞒欺骗和狡赖。再加上强有力的领导，能够了解全盘情况，细密分析问题，并予被批评的干部以发言说理的机会，说明他们的某些错误是要上级负责，上级当时也可替他作证，这样就可分清责任，使得一切问题都能获得实事求是的解决，避免群众单纯片面的观察党员干部缺点。第三、用这种党内动员说服与群众民主力量相结合的方式，要地主富农出身的农村党员干部交出土地财产来，也会比一般的把他们交给群众大会去斗争的方式要更适当些。
