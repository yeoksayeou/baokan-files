    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Delayed news: On December 25th of last year, while our People's Liberation Army was fiercely fighting eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandits invading Laiyang, US Marine Corps Squad Leader Pollard, with four soldiers in a jeep, suddenly approached our army's position near Wanglintao (50 li north of Jimo) in Waqian District, Jimo County, Jiaodong Liberated Area. Under the then-urgent combat situation, our frontline troops immediately took self-defensive counterattacks, seriously wounding Private Brighton. After being wounded, the soldier was rescued by our army and sent to a field hospital, where he died due to the severity of his injuries. Squad Leader Pollard, along with soldiers Dixson, Private First Class Jabodistria, and Private First Class Hart, were captured alive, and five guns were seized. Investigation reveals that these five US soldiers were serving in the Western Pacific Fleet Command. At the very moment when our army was engaged in a fierce battle with Chiang's bandits, they actually accompanied Chiang's bandit troops into the battlefield, invading our frontline positions. This is solid evidence of direct US assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's war effort. The local military and civilians are filled with indignation, unanimously believing that this action is a serious act of undermining the friendship between the Chinese and American people. Our Jiaodong Military Region Headquarters has lodged a serious protest with the US Navy, demanding that the US side apologize and guarantee that US troops will not invade our liberated areas again, and that US troops will not assist Chiang's bandit army in fighting against us again. Otherwise, if similar incidents occur again in the future, the consequences shall be entirely borne by the US military and the US government. If the responsible authorities of the US Navy can accept our above-mentioned reasonable demands, we will, in the spirit of friendship between the Chinese and American people, treat the captured US soldiers leniently.

    美军犯我胶东王麟陶阵地
    我军坚决自卫反击
    【新华社华东十三日电】迟到消息：去年十二月二十五日，我解放军正与进犯莱阳蒋匪八个旅激战之际，美海军陆战队伍长波拉德率领士兵四名，乘吉普车一辆，于胶东解放区即墨县属瓦前区王麟陶（即墨北五十里）附近，突然进逼我军阵地，在当时紧急战斗情况下，我火线部队即采取自卫反击，重伤其上等兵布莱顿一名，该兵负伤后，由我军救护，送往野战医院后，因伤重毙命。生俘伍长波拉德一名，及士兵逖克逊，上等兵贾波迪斯特利亚，上等兵哈脱等士兵三名，缴枪五支。按查该五名美军系在西太平洋舰队司令部服务，此次正当我军与将匪激战时，竟伴随蒋匪军混入战地，向我火线侵犯，实为直接帮助蒋匪作战之铁证，当地军民对此莫不愤慨填胸，咸认此举显系严重破坏中美人民友谊之行动。我胶东军区司令部已向美海军方面提出严重抗议，并要求美方道歉，保证美军今后不得再侵犯我解放区，及美军不得再援助蒋匪军向我作战，否则，倘今后再发生类似情事，其后果均应由美军及美国政府完全负责。如果美海军机关负责方面，能接受我上述合理要求，则我对被俘美军，亦本中美人民友谊精神宽大处理。
