Chiang Kai-shek's Treacherous Sale of China's New Twenty-One Demands
Chen Boda

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his recent revolutionary proclamation "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," stated: "The Chinese reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, are exactly like the running dog of Japanese imperialism, Wang Jingwei, acting as running dogs of American imperialism, selling China to the United States, launching war against the Chinese people, and preventing the advance of the Chinese people's liberation cause." Now, I am publishing this section of my draft "Public Enemy Chiang Kai-shek" in the newspaper for everyone to study as a reference to Comrade Mao Zedong's great revolutionary proclamation. Note by the author.

The social foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war is the feudal and comprador system, but the main force relied upon is external rather than internal. Without the aid of American imperialism to Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people could have easily swept away this pile of garbage, the Chiang family dynasty. In order to maintain the tottering final dynasty of the great feudal slave owners and big foreign firm compradores, so that American imperialism could exclusively occupy China, American imperialists used all means to aid Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. On August 22, 1945, after Japan's surrender, Truman declared that all Lend-Lease contracts would no longer continue. However, in order to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people war, Truman went back on his word and announced on November 15 that the Lend-Lease program for the Kuomintang would be extended again. An editorial in the Shanghai *China Weekly Review* on December 21, 1946, introduced a pamphlet exposed by the American "Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy" regarding US imperialist activities in China, which included some general materials:

The committee's summary of the post-war Lend-Lease program is:

According to the *New York Times* of September 27, 1945, the total amount of American surplus war materials in the India-Burma theater was US$500 million, all of which was sold to China. Among them, US$150 million of military supplies, including 700 aircraft, had already been transferred.

According to Truman's report on the Lend-Lease program, the Nationalist government received a total of US$600.2 million in Lend-Lease materials from Japan's surrender to the end of 1945, including vehicles worth US$68.8 million and ammunition worth US$50 million.

In addition, the United States has repeatedly allowed the sale of surplus materials to China. One item was sold on July 30, 1946, for US$150 million. On August 31, 1946, surplus war materials from the Pacific Islands were sold for US$825 million.

The loans that the Export-Import Bank has granted to China are known to be two. One is US$560 million. According to the "Wall Street Journal" of November 29, 1945, two-thirds of this loan will be used up by the end of 1946. The other is a US$670 million loan for American cotton, which was published in a US Information Service announcement on September 12, 1946.

In mid-July 1946, 271 warships were sent to the Nationalist government.

The above is an incomplete estimate of the United States' military and financial aid to the Kuomintang government. However, several items are worth noting. The total number of Chinese troops equipped and trained by the United States is 22 armies, 57 divisions, totaling 700,700 people. In addition, several armies received American equipment but were not trained by the United States. The numbers of air force and navy personnel already trained or being trained are also not included. On October 6, 1945, Admiral Barbey announced that a naval training center had been established in Qingdao, and three classes had already graduated, with 1,000 people in each class. Since Japan's surrender until July 1946, more than 1,000 naval officers had been trained in the United States. This program is still ongoing. According to Zhou Zhirou of the Aviation Commission, from Japan's surrender to February 1946, the government sent 2,000+ air force officers to the United States. He said that all the expenses for this program were paid for from the Lend-Lease program.

According to the committee's statement: Since Japan's surrender, the US government has established a naval training school in Qingdao, an automobile training school in Nanjing, a communications unit training school and an engineering training school in Kunming, several parachute troop schools in Kunming, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hengyang, a special engineer training school in Chongqing, an air force training school in Hangzhou, and an air force officer school in Chengdu.

The schools before Japan's surrender, including a staff training school, an infantry school, an artillery school, a Sino-American joint air force school, two Sino-American joint army training schools, and five Sino-American special training classes, will continue to operate.

This very incomplete account, and only up to 1946, explains the well-known driving force behind Chiang Kai-shek's major civil war. But what price did Chiang Kai-shek pay to American imperialism?

First, expend China's territorial rights, allowing American troops to be stationed in China and giving the United States land bases.

Second, expend China's airspace rights, allowing American aircraft to freely patrol all of China and giving the United States air bases.

Third, expend China's territorial sea rights, allowing the American navy to freely cruise China's territorial waters, freely station in China's seaports, and giving the United States naval bases.

Fourth, expend China's political power, allowing the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs, recognizing the United States' final decision-making power over China's internal affairs, allowing the United States to determine the Chiang family dynasty's internal policies, and placing the Chiang family dynasty's various political institutions under the supervision of American advisors or other titles.

Fifth, expend China's military power, replacing "nationalization of the army" with Americanization of the army, placing the Chiang family dynasty's army, air force, and navy under the control of American military advisory groups.

Sixth, expend China's financial power, allowing the United States to supervise the Chiang family dynasty's finances and turning China's financial system into an appendage of the American financial system.

Seventh, expend China's diplomatic power, with foreign policy dictated by Washington, undermining the veto power to defend China's independent diplomacy in the United Nations, supporting the American imperialist policy of protecting Japanese aggressors, allowing Japanese fishing boats to fish in Chinese coastal waters, resuming trade with Japan before the peace treaty, implementing the Japanese aggressors' original plan of "industrial Japan, agricultural China," and acting as an assistant to American war-mongers, provoking a third world war.

Eighth, expend China's police power, allowing American military police to patrol in China, with some places implementing "Sino-American joint police and military duties," organizing "Sino-American police and military liaison offices," and cooperating with the United States to train secret agents, jointly operating the so-called "Sino-American Cooperation Institute" and the so-called "Sino-American Joint Secret Agent Training Class" so that the United States can control the police, military police, and secret agents under the rule of the Chiang family dynasty.

Ninth, expend China's judicial power, reviving extraterritoriality (for example, agreeing with the United States that "all American military personnel in China who commit criminal cases shall be tried exclusively by their own military courts and military authorities") and disguised consular jurisdiction (for example, organizing the so-called "Sino-American Business Arbitration Committee").

Tenth, expend China's human rights, allowing the American military to freely slaughter, rape, and insult Chinese people for pleasure within Chinese territory.

(⑴⑵)

Eleventh, recognize the universal freedom of American residents in China, allowing them to freely reside, travel, do business, and engage in all other undertakings throughout Chinese territory, not only enjoying the same treatment as Chinese people, but also enjoying privileges that Chinese people do not have, that is, turning China into America's China.

Twelfth, recognize the United States' free reconnaissance rights and aerial photography rights in China, providing the United States with all national secrets.

Thirteenth, expend China's industrial and mining rights, allowing the United States to invest in all industrial and mining industries so that American financial capital can freely engage in exclusive control and "development" in China, especially in operating military base industries.

Fourteenth, expend China's agricultural rights, preparing for the so-called "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" to carry out the plan of "Sino-American joint control of agricultural production."

Fifteenth, expend China's fishing rights, allowing the United States to operate and monopolize China's fishery production.

Sixteenth, expend China's commercial rights, allowing American goods to engage in exclusive dumping in China through "legal trade" and various forms of smuggling.

Seventeenth, expend China's customs rights, abandoning protective tariffs, and agreeing to the demands of American imperialism to use customs as collateral for loans from the United States.

Eighteenth, expend China's inland river navigation rights, allowing the United States to destroy China's shipping industry.

Nineteenth, expend China's railway transportation rights, starting with the "Sino-American joint venture" of the Yuehan Railway and the Chuandian Railway.

Twentieth, expend China's cultural and educational rights, allowing the United States to control China's education through free cultural and educational activities in China and in the form of educational foundations.

Twenty-first, recognize the United States' sole "suzerainty" over China, the so-called "treatment enjoyed by it, in any case, shall not be lower than the treatment given to any third country now or in the future," which is to openly turn China into an exclusive dependency and colony of American imperialism.

All patriotic compatriots! This is a shocking New Twenty-One Demands that will lead to national subjugation and racial extinction! This is the greatest auction in ancient and modern times! Looking at China's sovereignty, from land to sea, from sky to ground, from politics to economy, from material to culture, from the present to the future, is there anything that has not been auctioned off by Chiang Kai-shek? The vast majority of these Twenty-One Demands have been publicly expressed in separate or relatively concentrated written treaties. Some have not yet been expressed in public written treaties, but in fact, they have been implemented step by step in the KMT-controlled areas! The vast majority are facts first, followed by treaties. The treaties that the US and Chiang have successively announced are almost all treaty confirmations of existing facts. The reason why the US and Chiang have not fully concentrated and publicized these Twenty-One Demands in one treaty is because what they consider important is the realization of the facts, and it depends on the step-by-step advancement of the facts, and complete concentration in one treaty would easily arouse the Chinese people's surprise. But there are also treaties that are relatively concentrated in expression, such as the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," the so-called "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation," signed on November 4, 1946. This is truly a sharp knife piercing the heart of the Chinese people! The British weekly "New Statesman and Nation," published on November 22 of the same year, explained the conclusion of the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" in this way: "It is a large and strong country destroying every line of defense of an economically backward country, and this is the price of supporting a traitorous and reactionary government to engage in civil war in order to control the economic lifeline of this country." In fact, this estimate is not complete. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty is a form, an aspect, of the fact that American imperialism has already controlled China militarily, politically, financially, and economically through Chiang Kai-shek's hands. The fact that American imperialism controls China militarily, politically, financially, and economically is the cause, and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is the effect. However, the effect becomes the cause again, and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty will inevitably strengthen American imperialism's control over China. This is a slave contract that China has never had before. Let's compare the Twenty-One Demands presented by Japanese imperialism to Yuan Shikai in the fifth year of the Republic of China with this "Sino-American Commercial Treaty." The privileges stipulated in Japan's Twenty-One Demands still have a considerable scope. And let's compare the secret agreement between Japan and Wang Jingwei with this "Sino-American Commercial Treaty." The military, political, and economic privileges stipulated by Japanese imperialism in that secret agreement also pointed out certain zones. However, the privileges included in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty for the United States in China cover "the entire territory of China," and what it reflects is not only economic privileges, but in fact, it reflects that American imperialism enjoys all privileges militarily, politically, financially, economically, and in culture and education. Because anyone can clearly see that if American imperialism had not obtained military, political, and financial control privileges in China, it would be impossible to obtain such economic privileges. Shortly after the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," on December 20, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek signed the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement," which sold out all of China's airspace rights. One agreement followed another, and each agreement supplemented the new content of Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous sale of China's New Twenty-One Demands. Public agreements are not enough, so add secret agreements. Secret agreements are not enough, so supplement them with public agreements. Big agreements are not enough, supplement them with small agreements. Small agreements are not enough, so here comes a big agreement again. On October 17, 1947, the Chiang thief government agreed to the US military's note on stationing troops in China, signed the so-called "Sino-American Relief Agreement" on October 27, the "US-China Education Fund Agreement" signed on November 10, the "Sino-American Naval Agreement" officially announced on December 8, and the secret negotiations on loans secured by customs, etc., are all enrichments and more concretization of the above-mentioned New Twenty-One Demands. In short, we are the fish and meat on the chopping block, this is everything about all Chiang-US agreements, and in reality, the US military's killings and rapes in China have made the Chinese people even worse than fish and meat. In early 1946, the US military authorities in Tianjin stipulated the price of Chinese people, that is, for every Chinese person killed by the US military, a compensation of 100,000 KMT currency would be paid uniformly, while a dead donkey would be compensated 135,000 yuan. Therefore, a reporter from the United Press said: "The US military discovered that in this productive country, human life is very cheap." In fact, countless Chinese people, simply because the US military wanted to have fun, were either killed, crushed to death, thrown into the water to die, raped to death, ... where is there any "price"? The vicious and evil Chiang Kai-shek is selling the Chinese people without any price!

People all know that Yuan Shikai was a great traitor who sold the country. The articles in the fifth category of Japan's Twenty-One Demands mainly stipulated that Japan would control the entire political, financial, military, police, railway transportation, and cultural power of China. However, Yuan Shikai's agreement was still cautious, and Japanese imperialism was also afraid of causing trouble all at once, so in the end, this fifth category was only written as "negotiations will be held later." No matter how treacherous Yuan Shikai was, and how clumsy his lies were, he also knew that signing the Twenty-One Demands would offend the world and future generations. In the so-called "secret discussion," he also wrote that it was a "foreign enemy," and also wrote "what the heart considers dangerous, shed tears and say, do not forget the events of May 7." Moreover, when Yuan Shikai and the Northern Warlords were in power, the Twenty-One Demands were not truly implemented. But what about Chiang Kai-shek? Chiang Kai-shek's New Twenty-One Demands sold out everything. Mencius said: "Everyone has a sense of shame and evil." But Chiang Kai-shek has no sense of shame or evil at all. He sold it very "generously." Unlike Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek does not think that American imperialism's exclusive occupation of China is a "foreign enemy." According to Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Daily News" editorial, Chiang Kai-shek believes that "anti-Americanism is anti-motherland." In Chiang Kai-shek's dictionary, "China" has long ceased to be an independent geographical noun.

Patriotic compatriots! This is the actual content of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a major civil war! For whom is Chiang Kai-shek fighting against the Chinese people? In 1946, the British public opinion circle once said: "Truman is the supreme commander directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to conduct the civil war." In July 1946, Bai Chongxi held a high-level military officer meeting in Xinxiang, saying: "Marshal Ma once blamed us for not fighting well outside the customs, that the Kuomintang army is too useless, so this time everyone must fight for a breath, otherwise Marshal Ma will scold us for being useless again." This truly vividly shows the slave mentality of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group launching the civil war. On July 26, 1947, Chiang's Central News Agency New York telegram reported a letter from the "American Policy Association for China," organized by American invaders, to Wedemeyer, which stated: "The Chinese National Government is fighting for us today." Chiang's bandit news agency reported this naked declaration of American invaders with a despicable sense of gratitude, and this declaration, from Chiang Kai-shek's side, is to announce that Chiang Kai-shek is fighting for American imperialism. The American Howard newspaper system said: "From the American point of view, there is one important thing that is very correct - Chiang Kai-shek is within the American front." Chiang Kai-shek can no longer be regarded as a "Chinese," and if he is to be regarded as anything, he can only be regarded as the biggest traitor and national betrayal in China. This is said completely and clearly from what American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek himself have announced.

However, while Chiang Kai-shek is able to betray China, the Chinese people have full power to restore China. Chiang Kai-shek is an incomparably greater traitor than Yuan Shikai, but the power of the Chinese people is incomparably greater than in Yuan Shikai's era. Yuan Shikai's dynasty was shattered by the power of the Chinese people in the era of the old democratic revolution, and Chiang Kai-shek's dynasty will surely be shattered by the greater power of the Chinese people in the era of the new democratic revolution. And it will definitely be shattered completely. And the American imperialist plan to destroy China will also be completely shattered by the Chinese people soon, and the Chinese people will definitely completely end imperialist aggression against China.

　　蒋介石盗卖中国的新廿一条
    陈伯达
    毛泽东同志最近关于中国大革命的檄文“目前形势和我们的任务”说到：“以蒋介石为首的中国反动派，和日本帝国主义的走狗汪精卫一模一样，充当美国帝国主义的走狗，将中国出卖给美国，发动战争，反对中国人民，阻止中国人民解放事业的前进。”现将拙稿“人民公敌蒋介石”这一节先在报纸上发表出来，供作大家研究毛泽东同志这个大革命檄文的参考。作者记。
    蒋介石进行内战的社会基础是封建与买办的制度，但所依靠的主要力量在外而不在内。如果没有美帝国主义对蒋介石的援助，中国人民早就可以轻快地扫除了蒋家朝廷这一堆垃圾。为着维持大封建奴隶主与大洋行买办这个摇摇欲坠的最后王朝，以便美国帝国主义独占中国，美帝国主义者援助蒋介石的内战，用了一切的方法。一九四五年八月二十二日在日本投降之后，杜鲁门宣称一切租借法案的契约不再继续，可是，为着支持蒋介石反人民的战争，杜鲁门就自食其言，于十一月十五日宣称对国民党的租借法案将再延长。上海密勒氏评论报一九四六年十二月二十一日的社论，介绍过美国“民主的远东政策委员会”暴露美帝在华活动的一个小册子，其中有些概括的材料：
    该委员会对战后租借法案的总结是：
    根据一九四五年九月二十七日纽约时报载，印缅战区美国剩余战争物资总量五亿美金，悉数售与中国，其中一亿五千万美金之军火，包括七百架飞机，已经移交清楚。
    根据杜鲁门关于租借法案的报告，自日本投降起到一九四五年底止，国民政府共收到租借物资六亿零二百万美金，包括价值六千八百万美金的车辆和五千万美金的弹药。
    此外，美国还几次允许将剩余的物资售与中国。一项是一九四六年七月三十日售与的一亿五千万美金。一九四六年八月三十一日出售太平洋岛屿剩余战争物资，计八亿二千五百万美金。
    进出口银行已借给中国的贷款已知道的有两笔。一笔为五亿六千万美金。据一九四五年十一月二十九日“华尔街日报”所载，这笔贷款到一九四六年底将用去三分之二。另一笔为六亿七千万美金的美棉贷款，这是美国新闻处一九四六年九月十二日公告上发表的。
    一九四六年七月中，送给国民政府军舰二百七十一艘。
    以上所述是美国在军事上、财政上、援助国民党政府的不完全的一个估计。然而，有几项是值得注意的。全部美国所装备及训练的中国军队数字计二十二个军，五十七个师，共七十万零七千人。此外还有几个军得到美国装备但未经美国训练。还有已经训练或正在训练中的空军和海军数字亦不包括在内。一九四五年十月六日巴贝海军上将宣布，在青岛已成立一海军训练所，已有三班毕业，每班一千人。自日本投降起到一九四六年七月止，海军士官有一千人以上在美受训。此项计划现仍继续进行。根据航空委员会周至柔说，自日本投降到一九四六年二月止，政府已派空军士官二千×百人赴美。他说这计划的所有费用是由租借法案中偿付之。
    据该会宣称：自从日本投降起美国政府设立了一个海军训练学校在青岛，一个汽车训练学校在南京，一个通信部队训练学校及一个工程训练学校在昆明，若干降落伞部队学校在昆明、南京、广州和衡阳，一个特种工程师训练学校在重庆，一个空军训练学校在杭州，一个空军军官学校在成都。
    日本投降前的学校，包括一个参谋训练学校，一个步兵学校，一个炮兵学校，一个中美混合空军学校，两个中美联合陆军训练学校和五个中美特别训练班，还将继续办下去。
    这一个很不完全的、而且只说到一九四六年的帐单，说明了人所共知的蒋介石举行大内战的动力。但蒋介石则付给了美帝国主义以什么代价呢？
    第一，支出中国的领土权，让美国军队驻在中国，给美国以陆军基地。
    第二，支出中国的领空权，让美国飞机自由巡逻全中国，给美国以空军基地。
    第三，支出中国的领海权，让美国海军自由游弋中国的领海，自由驻防中国的海港，给美国以海军基地。
    第四，支出中国的政权，让美国干涉中国内政，承认美国对中国内政的最后决定权，由美国决定蒋家朝廷对内的各种政策，把蒋家朝廷各种政治机构放在美国顾问或其他名义的监督之下。
    第五，支出中国的军权，以军队美国化代替“军队国家化”，把蒋家朝廷的陆空海军放在美国军事顾问团的支配之下。
    第六，支出中国的财权，由美国监督蒋家朝廷的财政，并把中国的金融系统变成美国金融系统的附属品。
    第七，支出中国的外交权，对外政策一切听命于华盛顿，破坏在联合国中保卫中国独立外交的否决权，拥护美国帝国主义保护日本侵略者的政策，允许日本渔船在中国沿海捕鱼，在对日和约之前恢复对日贸易，执行日本侵略者原来“工业日本，农业中国”的计划，充当美国战争贩子的助手，挑拨第三次世界大战。
    第八，支出中国的警察权，让美国宪兵驻在中国巡逻，有地方实行“中美警宪联合勤务”，组织“中美警宪联络室”；与美国合作训练特务，合办所谓“中美合作所”与所谓“中美联合特务训练班”，以便美国控制蒋家朝廷统治下的警察，宪兵与特务。
    第九，支出中国的司法权，复活治外法权（例如与美国协定“一切美国军事人员在华如犯刑事案件的，交由其本国军事法庭军事当局单独裁判”）和变相的领事裁判权（例如组织所谓“中美商务公断委员会”）。
    第十，支出中国的人权，让美军在中国领土内以自由屠杀、奸淫、侮辱中国人为取乐。
    　　　　（⑴⑵）
    第十一，承认美国在中国的居民的普遍自由权，许其在中国领土全境内，自由居住、旅行、经商以及经营其他一切事业，不仅与中国人同等待遇，并且享有中国人民所没有的特权，即把中国变成美国人的中国。
    第十二，承认美国在中国的自由侦察权与空中摄影权，供给美国全部国家秘密。
    第十三，支出中国的工矿权，允许美国投资一切工矿业，以便美国金融资本自由在中国进行独占和“开发”，特别是经营军事基地工业。
    第十四，支出中国的农业权，准备由所谓“中美农业技术合作团”进行“中美一起管制农业生产”的计划。
    第十五，支出中国的渔业权，由美国经营垄断中国渔业的生产。
    第十六，支出中国的商业权，让美国商品经过“合法贸易”与走私的各种形式，在中国进行独占的倾销。
    第十七，支出中国的海关权，放弃保护税，并同意美帝国主义的要求，将海关作为向美国借款的抵押。
    第十八，支出中国的内河航行权，让美国摧毁中国的航业。
    第十九，支出中国的铁路交通权，由“中美合办”粤汉路和川滇路开始。
    第二十，支出中国的文化教育权，由美国经过对华文化教育的自由活动与以教育基金的形式控制中国的教育。
    第二十一，承认美国对于中国的惟一“宗主权”，所谓“其所享受之待遇，无论如何，不得低于现在或将来所给予任何第三国之待遇”，即系公开把中国变为美国帝国主义独占的附属国与殖民地。
    一切爱国的同胞们！这是惊心动魄的亡国灭种的新二十一条！这是古今中外最大的拍卖！看中国的主权，从陆上到海上，从天上到地下，从政治到经济，从物质到文化，从现在到将来，还没有被蒋介石拍卖在内的吗？这廿一条绝大部分已公开表现在分别的或比较集中的成文的条约，有的虽则还没有经过公开的成文的条约表现出来，但事实上，在蒋管区都条条步步实现了！绝大部分都是事实在先，条约在后，蒋美所陆续公布的条约，差不多都是对于业已存在的事实加以条约上的肯定而已。美蒋所以没有把这二十一条完全集中公开在一个条约上，因为他们所认为重要的，是事实的实现，并有待于事实的步步推进，而且完全集中在一个条约上，就容易引起中国人民的惊觉。但比较集中表现的条约也是有的，例如一九四六年十一月四日签订的“中美商约”，即所谓“中美友好通商航海条约”。这真是一把尖刀刺入中国人的心脏！同年十一月二十二日出版的英国“新国家与民族”周刊上这样解释过“中美商约”的缔结：“就是一个大而强的国家，摧毁一个经济上落后的国家的每道国防线，而且这就是支援卖国的和反动的政府从事内战，以达到掌握这个国家经济命脉的代价”。事实上，这还估计得不完全。中美商约乃是美国帝国主义经过蒋介石的手，业已在军事上、政治上、财政上、经济上控制了中国所表现的一种形式，一个方面的形式。美国帝国主义在军事上政治上财政上经济上控制中国的事实是因，中美商约是果，不过，果又变成因，中美商约必然又加强了美国帝国主义在中国的控制。这是中国从来没有的奴隶契约。试拿民国五年日本帝国主义向袁世凯提出的二十一条单和这一个“中美商约”相比吧，日本的二十一条所规定的特权，还有相当的范围。又再试拿日本与汪精卫的密约单和这一个“中美商约”相比较吧，日本帝国主义在那密约里面，所规定的军事的、政治的、经济的特权，也还指出一定的地带。但中美商约所包括的美国在中国的特权，却是包括了“中国领土全境内”，而其所反映的，并不只是经济的特权，实际上，是反映了美国帝国主义在军事上政治上财政上经济上文化教育上享有一切特权。因为任何人都能够清楚：美国帝国主义如果没有在中国取得军事上政治上与财政上控制的特权，要取得那种经济的特权，便是不可能的。在“中美商约”后不久，一九四六年十二月二十日，蒋介石又签订了出卖全部中国领空权的“中美航空协定”了。一个协定接着一个协定，而每一个协定都使蒋介石盗卖中国的新二十一条补充了新的内容。公开的协定不够，加之以秘密的协定；秘密的协定不够，又辅之以公开的协定。大协定不够，补充之以小协定；小协定不够，又来一个大协定。一九四七年十月十七日，蒋贼政府同意美军驻在中国的照会，十月二十七日签订所谓“中美救济协定”，十一月十日，签订的“美国对华教育基金协定”，十二月八日正式宣布的“中美海军协定”，以及关于以海关抵押借款的秘密谈判，……等等，都是对于上述新二十一条的充实和更具体化。总之，人为刀俎，我为鱼肉，这就是一切蒋美协定的一切，而在实际上，美军在中国的屠杀奸淫，已把中国人连比鱼肉都不如。一九四六年初天津的美军当局规定过中国人的价格，即美军杀死一个中国人，一律赔偿蒋币十万元，死驴子一条，则赔偿十三万五千元。因此联合社记者说：“美军发觉，在这多产的国家里，人命是非常便宜的”。其实，不知多少中国人，仅仅因为美军要取乐，或被杀死，或被碾死，或被抛掷水里而死，或被奸淫而死，………那里有什么“价格”？穷凶极恶的蒋介石是把中国人无价出卖的！
    人们都知道袁世凯是卖国的大奸恶。日本二十一条的第五号里面的条文，主要是规定由日本掌握整个中国政治、财政、军警、铁道交通与文化的大权，但袁世凯的答应还有所顾忌，而日本帝国主义也因为怕一下子惹出乱子，结果对这第五号，只写成了“日后协商”。不管袁世凯如何奸险，作伪日拙，也还知道他签订二十一条，是得罪于天下及后世子孙，在所谓“密论”里面，还写出那是“敌国外患”，又写出“心所谓危，涕泣而道，其毋忘五月七日之事”。而且，当袁世凯在日及北洋军阀执政时代，二十一条是没有真正实现的。可是，蒋介石又何如？蒋介石的新二十一条卖尽了一切。孟子说：“羞恶之心人皆有之”。但蒋介石却是一点羞恶之心也没有，他卖得很“慷慨”。和袁世凯不同，蒋介石丝毫不认为美国帝国主义独占中国是什么“敌国外患”。按照蒋介石的“中央日报”社论，蒋介石认为“反美即是反祖国”。在蒋介石的字典中，“中国”早已不成为独立的地理名词了。
    爱国的同胞们！这就是蒋介石发动大内战的实际内容！蒋介石是为谁而向中国人民作战？一九四六年英国舆论界曾称：“杜鲁门是指挥蒋介石集团进行内战的最高统帅”。一九四六年七月，白崇禧在新乡召开高级军官会议，说：“马帅曾责备我们关外没有打好仗，国民党军队太无用，所以这次大家必须争一口气，否则马帅又将骂我们无用了”。这真是活现了蒋介石卖国集团发动内战的奴才相。一九四七年七月二十六日蒋记中央社纽约电，报导美国侵略者所组织的“美国对华政策协会”致魏德迈一个函件，内称：“中国国民政府今日正为吾人而战”。蒋贼的通讯社以卑鄙感谢的心情报导美国侵略者这个赤裸裸的宣言，而这个宣言从蒋介石这方面来说，就是宣布蒋介石乃是为美国帝国主义而战。美国霍华德系报纸说：从美国之观点而言，有一重要甚为正确者--蒋介石乃在美国阵线之内”。蒋介石已不能算做“中国人”，要算，只能算是中国的最大汉奸卖国贼，这从美国帝国主义者与蒋介石自己所宣布的，是说得完全明明白白的了。
    然而，蒋介石能够盗卖中国，中国人民却有充分的力量能够恢复中国。蒋介石比袁世凯是不可比拟的更大的卖国大盗，但中国人民的力量比袁世凯时代却更大得不可比拟。袁世凯王朝在旧民主主义革命时代，被中国人民的力量所打碎，蒋介石王朝在新民主主义革命时代，更一定将被中国人民更大的力量所打碎。并且一定将被打碎得彻头彻尾。而美国帝国主义灭亡中国的计划也一定将很快地被中国人民所完全打碎，并且中国人民一定即将由此完全终结帝国主义中国的侵略。
