　　Most Cadres and Party Members Determined to Correct Mistakes, Accept People's Review, and Forever Stand with the Party
    Good cadres all support the Land Law. A portion of cadres with poor work styles who had divided excessive fruits, due to their own errors and shortcomings, and unclear understanding of the Land Law, once had some resistance in their thinking, feeling fearful and uneasy. In Xiyang, individual village cadres privately hid newspapers, afraid to read the Land Law to the masses. Some, fearing they would have to return the excessively gained fruits, infringed upon the interests of the middle peasants, attempting to curry favor with the poor and hired peasants. Cadres in Xima Village, Shahe, emphasized "following the poor and hired peasant line," wanting to completely confiscate the public shares contributed to the cooperatives during the movement and give them to the poor and hired peasants, and also requiring the sixty middle peasant households to contribute all 2,600 jin of grain for teachers' salaries and cadre travel expenses. Wu Cai’gui, the director of the peasant association in Houlinhe Village, Wu’an, was a wealthy middle peasant who had turned over well. Fearing that he would have to return too many fruits, he sent two bundles of clothes and some millet and corn to his sisters' homes in Yuewei Township. He also sold many items, ground white flour, and bought rice noodles, feasting every day, saying: "I'll live it up one day at a time." In Yiren Village, Neiqiu, cadre Li Jichun (political director), upon hearing about the Land Law in the district, returned to the village and removed the barbed wire from his house, selling it for 50,000 yuan, and also sold a large locust tree. Some cadres, using the excuse of disagreeing with giving landlords a share, resisted the Land Law, unwilling to return the excessively gained fruits. For example, cadres in Dongguan Village, Heshun, said: "Giving the landlords a share is simply going backwards." In Shili Village, Wu'an, the director of the Military Affairs Committee said: "Dividing land to the landlords is us making peace with the landlords." The broad masses of peasants rose up to criticize this statement as incorrect, saying: "Equal land distribution is beneficial to the peasants, for the sake of everyone's permanent liberation. Cadres should support the Land Law and implement the Party's policies, and not have bad intentions, trying to avoid returning the excessively gained fruits." Many honest village cadres and Party members supported the Land Law and were willing to return the excessively occupied fruits, standing with the poor and hired peasants. For example, the militia captain from a poor peasant background in Houlinhe Village, Wu'an, confessed that during the June movement last year, he and the director of the peasant association and the political director stole fruits, quilts, and clothes. When the comrades of the Nanmen Street General Branch in Chengguan District, Xiangyuan, conducted a self-examination, the political director and the street leader said: "I used to be poor too, but after becoming a cadre, I forgot the poor and hired peasants and left them." They have already begun to actively help the poor and hired peasants with production.

    From the above situation, it can be seen that the broad masses of cadres and Party members, through the education and supervision of the Party and the masses, support the Land Law. Of course, we should pay attention to landlords, rich peasants, and hooligans who have infiltrated the Party to spread rumors and sabotage. These people should be immediately expelled from the Party, removed from their positions, and reviewed by the masses. For Party members and cadres of peasant origin, we must enlighten their consciousness, encourage them to reflect on their forgetting-their-roots thinking, educate them to return to the workers' and peasants' standpoint, accept the review of the masses, and implement the Land Law together with the peasants. Strive to become good hired laborers of the people in this movement. In some places, simply detaining people from above is not the solution. We must believe that the masses have the power to educate them. Even if the "masses" demand "detention," we must examine whether it is truly the opinion of the masses.

　　干部党员大多数决心改过  接受人民审查永远和党一道
    好干部都是拥护土地法的。一部分多分果实作风不好的干部，自己有了错误和缺点，对土地法又认识不清，思想上曾经有些抵抗，恐惧不安。昔阳有个别村干私藏报纸，不敢给群众念土地法。还有的怕自己多得的果实要拿出来，就侵害中农利益，向贫雇买好。沙河西马庄干部强调"走贫雇路线"，要把合作社在运动中入的公股完全没收归贫雇，派教员薪金和干部支差米两千六百斤，也完全叫六十户中农拿出来。武安后林河村农会主任武才贵是富裕中农，翻身很高，怕退多占果实，就把两包袱衣服和黍籽、玉茭一部分送到岳未乡他姊妹家，又卖了好多东西，磨了白面，买上大米粉条，天天大吃，说："过了一天算一天。"内邱诣仁村干部李吉春（政治主任）在区里听到土地法，回村就把自己分的房子上的铁丝网摘下，卖了五万元，又卖了一棵大槐树。一部分干部借口不同意给地主分一份抵抗土地法，不想退出多得果实。如和顺东关村干部说："给地主一份，简直是倒算。"武安十里店，武委会主任说："分土地给地主是咱们跟地主讲和了。"广大农民都起来批评这种说法不对，他们说："平分土地是对农民有利，为了大家永久翻身，干部更应拥护土地法，执行党的政策，不要想些坏心思，逃避退出多得果实"。很多老老实实的村干党员，都拥护土地法，愿意退出多占果实，和贫雇农民站在一道。如武安后林河贫雇出身的民兵队长，谈出他在去年六月运动中，和农会主任、政治主任一同偷了果实被子衣服。襄垣城关区南门街全支部的同志进行检查时，政治主任和街长说："我从前也是穷人，当了干部就忘了贫雇，离开了贫雇。"他们已开始积极帮助贫雇生产。
    从以上情形看，广大的干部和党员，经过党和群众的教育和监督，是拥护土地法的。当然我们应该注意有些地主分子、富农分子、流氓分子钻进党内造谣破坏，这些人应一律停止党籍，撤销职务，由群众审查。对农民出身的党员和干部，要启发他们觉悟，反省忘本思想，教育他们回到工农立场上来，接受群众的审查，和农民一道实行土地法。争取在这次运动中当个人民的好长工。有些地方单纯由上而下的扣押也不是办法，要相信群众有力量教育他们。就是"群众"要求"扣"，也要审办是不是真正群众的意见。
