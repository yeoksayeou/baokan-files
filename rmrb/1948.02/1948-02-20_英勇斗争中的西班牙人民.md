The Spanish People in Heroic Struggle

A Precious Last Testament

One day in February 1946, Cristino Garcia, the famous Spanish resistance leader, wrote a letter to his comrades from Carabanchel prison. He had been waiting a long time for the opportunity to write this letter. The letter read:

"You may wonder why I didn't write to you sooner. This is because I was previously unsure whether the communication channels we are currently using are secure, fearing that what I wrote would fall into the hands of the spies."

He felt that this letter might be his last, so he wrote: "I know what my end will be... The situation for me and other comrades is hopeless." After briefly describing the terrible tortures he had suffered, he conveyed his experiences as a resistance leader to his comrades in a few concise sentences. The first thing that came to his mind was the importance of launching guerrilla warfare in Spain:

"Before I breathe my last, I want to tell you some experiences that I believe will prove useful... Nothing frightens the bandits more than guerrilla warfare. The greatest attention must be paid to the development of guerrilla warfare. I believe that in selecting the commanders of the guerrilla units, one must be very careful. They should be capable people."

The Flames of Guerrilla Warfare are Lit in Every Province

Comrade Garcia was shot by the bandits, but his comrades followed his advice. Today, there is not a single province in Spain without well-organized and well-equipped guerrilla units. The following figures are a powerful illustration:

1945, the guerrilla forces fought 350 battles – an average of 29 battles per month.

1946, fought 446 battles – an average of 37 battles per month.

In the first two months and twelve days of 1947, fought 98 battles – an average of 40 battles per month.

The famous Republican military leader, Juan Modesto, recently made an analysis of these battles. He pointed out that it not only demonstrates the scale and diversity of the guerrilla movement, but also its growth and development. In these battles, the guerrilla forces were in the initiative 75 percent of the time. The days when Franco's army was relentlessly pursuing and the guerrillas were always on the defensive are over.

Revenge on the Falangist Bandits

Retaliation against the Falangist bandits is a very important part of the guerrilla activities. It helped to disintegrate the enemy's ferocity and supported the morale of the entire resistance movement.

On January 14th this year, resistance leaders Isasa and Rellán were murdered by Falangist bandits. Six days later, the Galician guerrilla command published an order for revenge in its newspaper:

Order

January 20th, at the Galician Guerrilla Command

The two guerrilla leaders, Isasa and Rellán, were vilely murdered by Franco's bandits in Madrid on the 14th of this month. In order to avenge them, I hereby issue the following order:

Each guerrilla unit must execute four Franco bandits before February 14th, and the commanders of each unit are responsible for reporting the completion of the order to this headquarters in writing before the aforementioned deadline.  Julián (signed)

How the various Galician guerrilla units carried out this order can be seen from the facts reported below.

In late January, the mayor of Vigo, in the Lago area, was killed and a civil guard was wounded.

On January 28th, a civil guard in Betanzos was killed and another was wounded.

On February 2nd, one civil guard each was killed in Gunas and Florin.

On February 3rd, a unit of civil guards was ambushed in the Caquero area.

On February 11th, the Falangist chieftain of Odón, Linares, was killed.

On February 13th, the Falangist chief and mayor of Oreros, Caunas, was killed.

This explains why the *Time* magazine reporter in its recent report also mentioned "the strengthening of guerrilla activity throughout Spain" and "the existence of a general state of tension."

Organizing the Peasant Army

The increasing growth of guerrilla activity naturally attracted the attention of Franco's bandits. Last summer they launched a full-scale offensive against the guerrillas. Although a large number of mechanized troops participated in this offensive, it finally failed completely. After the failure of the direct offensive, Franco has now turned to more cunning means. They organized "special anti-guerrilla detachments," composed of former Blue Shirts, civil guards, professional agents, and criminals, and gave them special training. These special detachments, recognizing that the guerrillas can exist because they have the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people, often disguised themselves as guerrillas, and then killed and set fires in order to undermine the peasants' faith in the guerrillas. After a fake guerrilla unit passed through a village, any farmer who expressed sympathy with the anti-fascist guerrillas was arrested. They also often attempted to infiltrate the real guerrilla units.

Under these circumstances, in order to fight victoriously, the guerrillas organized a vast "information network" among the people, paying attention to every activity of the Falangist bandits. The entry of a stranger into the village and any unusual actions must be reported to the resistance movement.

At the March meeting of the Communist Party of Spain, Modesto spoke about several guidelines for developing the guerrilla warfare movement. Pointing out that the mass struggle of the peasants lagged behind the struggle of the workers, he said that the responsibility of the guerrillas is to help the peasants organize and lead their struggle against the landlords and the Falangist bandits. Modesto also spoke of the need to organize hundreds of guerrilla groups in factories, mines, and ports. He said: "We must start doing this now, because the frequently occurring struggles of protests, demonstrations, and strikes should have their own self-defense organizations."

    英勇斗争中的西班牙人民
    一封宝贵的遗书
    一九四六年二月的某一天，西班牙著名的抵抗领袖克利斯蒂诺·加西亚从卡拉班彻狱中给他的同志们写来了一封信。他等待写这封信的机会已是很久了。这封信上写道：
    “你们也许奇怪，我为什么不早点写这封信给你们。这是因为我从前不知道我们现在所用的通讯路线是否是保险的，因而唯恐我写的东西落到特务们的手里去。”
    他已觉得这封信也许是他的最后一封信了，所以他又写道：“我知道我的结局是什么……我和其他同志的情势是没有什么希望了。”他在简单描述他所受的可怕肉刑后，即以简洁的几句话，把他作的抵抗领袖的经验，转告给他的同志们。他脑子所想到的第一件事就是在西班牙展开游击战的重要性：
    “在我停止呼吸之前，我愿告诉你们一些经验，这些经验我相信将会证明是有用的。……没有什么东西比游击战争更能使匪徒们害怕了。必须把最大的注意力放在发展游击战争问题上。我认为在选择游击队的指挥员上，必须十分谨慎。他们应是些精干的人。”
  每省都点起了游击战争的火焰
    加西亚同志是被匪徒们枪杀了，但他的同志们遵循了他的忠告。西班牙今天已经没有一个省没有组织完善与装备优良的游击队了。下面的数字是个有力的说明：
    一九四五年，游击队作战三五○次——平均每月作战二十九决。
    一九四六年，作战四四六次——平均每月作战三十七次。
    一九四七年头两个月又十二天，作战九十八次——每月平均四十次。
    著名的共和国军事领袖余安·摩德斯托最近对这些战斗作了一个分析。他指出，它不仅表现出游击战运动的规模与多样性，而且也表现出游击战的壮大与发展。在这些战斗中，百分之七十五都是游击队掌握主动。佛朗哥军队穷追不舍和游击队永远处于防守地位的时日，是业已过去了。
    向长枪党匪徒复仇
    对长枪党匪徒的报复是游击队活动的一个很重要部分。它帮助瓦解了敌人的凶势，支持了整个抵抗运动的士气。
    今年一月十四日，抵抗领袖伊萨沙与勒兰底二人被长枪党匪徒杀害。六天后，加里西亚的游击队司令部在它的报纸上，发表了复仇的命令：
  命令
    一月二十日于加里西亚游击队司令部
    伊萨沙和勒兰底两位游击队领袖已于本月十四日在马德里被佛朗哥匪徒卑鄙杀害。为了报仇，我特发出下列命令：
    每个游击部队必须在二月十四日以前，正法四个佛匪凶手，并责成各部队司令在上述限期之前，以书面向本部报告完成命令的情形。    余里安（签字）
    加里西亚各游击部队怎样执行了这一命令，可从下面一篇报导的事实中看出来。
    一月下旬拉哥区的维戈市市长被打死，一个宪兵被打伤。
    一月二十八日，贝坦佐地方一个宪兵被打死，另一个受伤。
    二月二日，古的那斯及佛林各有一个宪兵被杀死。
    二月三日，一队宪兵在卡区罗地方遭受伏击。
    二月十一日，奥登涅的长枪党匪魁林那雷斯被打死。
    二月十三日，奥雷罗斯的长枪党匪首兼市长考纳斯被打死。
    这就说明，为什么美国时代周刊记者在其最近的报导中，也说到“西班牙全国游击队活动的加强”和“普遍紧张状态的存生。”
  把农民大军组织起来
    游击队活动的日益增长自然引起了佛朗哥匪徒的注意。去年夏天他们曾对游击队发动了全面的攻势。这一攻势虽有大量机械化部队的参加，但最后终于完全失败了。佛朗哥在直接进攻失败之后，现在便转而采取更狡猾的手段。他们组织了“反游击队的别动队，由前蓝衫队员、宪兵、职业特务及罪犯组成，并予以特种训练。这些别动队由于认识到游击队之所以能存在，是由于获得广大人民的同情与支持，便常常乔装为游击队，然后杀人放火，以破坏农民对游击队的信仰。这种假游击队在经过一个村庄后，凡是表示同情反法西斯游击队的农民，都遭到逮捕。他们还常常企图打入真正的游击队里面来。
    在这种情况下，游击队为了胜利作战，就在人民中组织了广大的“情报网”，注意长枪党匪徒的每个活动。一个生人的入村和任何人的奇突行动，都必须给抵抗运动报告。
    在西班牙共产党的三月会议上，摩德所托说到了发展游击战运动的若干方针。他在指出农民的群众性斗争还落在工人斗争之后说：游击队的责任是帮助农民组织起来，领导他们反对大地主，及长枪党匪徒的斗争。摩氏还说到在各工厂、矿山、港口中组织成百个游击小组的必要。他说：“我们现在就要动手这样去做，因为抗议、示威及罢工等经常发生的斗争，应当有它自己自卫的组织”。（艾里奥作。鸿节译自“今日西班牙”四七年七月号）
