Xinhua General Branch Reporter's Commentary:
Military Region Forces Rapidly Grow and Strengthen - 58,000+ Chiang Bandits Annihilated in Five Months

[This dispatch] reports: After the southward expedition of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie armies, the military region forces of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area independently undertook the glorious task of clearing out the remaining enemy within the inner lines. From August to the end of the year last year, a total of more than 58,000 enemies were annihilated, and they greatly tempered and developed themselves, becoming a powerful force for the counter-offensive. The reporter pointed out: This matter is of extremely great significance, fully demonstrating that the strength of the people's army is infinite and grows extraordinarily rapidly. The reporter continued: Some comrades lacked a correct assessment of the counter-offensive situation and the changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves. They neither recognized that although there were still nearly 200,000 enemies around our area, they were all remnants and defeated soldiers, trapped in the peripheral points and lines, and had fallen into a purely defensive posture. Nor did they recognize that these Chiang bandits would inevitably make desperate and frenzied struggles when they were dying, and would never be willing to die themselves. These comrades were satisfied with the status quo, so they relaxed and became 麻痹, even content with ease and comfort, and did not give a strong rebuff to the Chiang bandits' mischief. The number of enemies annihilated in August, September, and October was only 20,000, with more than 6,000 in August, more than 9,000 in September, and more than 5,000 in October. The Central Bureau and the Military Region promptly and clearly pointed out that correctly understanding the situation as favorable to us, actively attacking the enemy, and building and cultivating the main force corps are the basic links to winning victory. Since then, all border areas have resolutely implemented the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance," continuing to vigorously carry out guerrilla warfare, and appropriately concentrating forces, focusing on and planning to organize campaigns and battles, and annihilating and eliminating the enemy's remaining strongholds one by one. The number of enemies annihilated in November increased to more than 11,000, and in December it increased again to more than 27,000, which was 7,000 more than the total number in August, September, and October, winning three consecutive victories in Dongping, Changyuan, and Yuncheng. Especially in the Battle of Yuncheng, the solid fortifications built by the Japanese invaders and renovated by the Chiang bandits were captured, and more than 10,000 enemies were annihilated in one fell swoop. This proves that the combat effectiveness of our inner-line corps has been greatly improved, and it can not only annihilate the enemy's vital forces in field battles, but also eliminate strong strongholds. Even if the Chiang bandits shrink into tortoise shells, they cannot escape the fate of death. The reporter concluded: The current large-scale military training movement in the entire region has achieved remarkable results. An even heavier iron fist will smash the remaining Chiang bandit strongholds one by one until they are completely eliminated.

    军区部队力量迅速生长壮大  五个月歼蒋匪五万八千余人
    【本报消息】新华总分社记者评述：晋冀鲁豫区军区部队，在刘邓、陈谢大军南征以后，独立担负肃清内线残敌的光荣任务。自去年八月至年底五个月，共歼敌五万八千余人，并大大锻炼与发展了自己，成为一支强大的反攻劲旅。记者指出：此事意义极为重大，充分显示人民军队的力量无穷无尽，而且生长异常迅速。记者继称：曾经有若干同志，对反攻形势及敌我力量变化缺乏正确估计，既不认识我区周围，虽尚有将近二十万敌人，但均系残兵败将，困守边沿点线，已陷入单纯防御的态势。更不认识这些蒋匪垂死时，必作绝望的疯狂的挣扎，决不肯自己死亡。这些同志满于现状，因此就松懈麻痹，甚至苟且偷安，没有给蒋匪的蠢动以有力的回击。八、九、十三个月歼敌数字仅两万人，计八月份六千余人，九月份九千余人，十月份五千余人。中央局、军区及时明确指出：正确认识形势对我有利，主动积极的进攻敌人，建设培养主力兵团，三者是争取胜利的基本环节。自此各边沿地区均坚决实行敌进我进继续猛烈开展游击战争，并适当集结兵力，有重点、有计划的组织战役战斗，各个歼灭拔除敌人的残留据点。十一月份歼敌数增至一万一千余人，十二月份再增至二万七千余人，比八、九、十三个月总数还多七千，连获东平、长垣、运城三捷。尤其是运城之战，攻克日寇建筑、蒋匪增修的坚固工事，一次歼敌万余。证明我内线兵团战斗力已大大提高，不仅能够在野战中歼灭敌人有生力量，而且能够拔除强固的据点。蒋匪即使缩在乌龟壳里，也逃不脱死亡的命运。记者末称：现全区部队大练兵运动已获显著成绩，更沉重的铁拳，即将一个一个把残留的蒋匪据点敲得粉碎，直到全部肃清为止。
