Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Moscow News: On February 23rd, the people of the entire Soviet Union warmly celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. Marshal Bulganin, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, ordered Moscow, the capitals of the Union Republics, and major cities, fortresses, and military ports to fire 30 artillery salutes at noon to mark the occasion. All circles in Moscow held a grand celebration at the Grand Theatre. Bulganin personally delivered a speech of over ten thousand words, elaborating on the military science of the Soviet Army's founding. The Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, Vasilevsky, also hosted a banquet for senior officials from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as envoys from various countries, which was a grand occasion. Theaters across the Soviet Union staged new plays depicting the glorious achievements of the Soviet Army, and cinemas also premiered the latest films, including the long-promoted "Stalingrad" and "Liberation of Crimea." Soviet workers have achieved remarkable results in the production competition launched to commemorate Army Day. Veterans are playing a leading role in this competition. For example, veteran Klett has completed his entire five-year plan for the holiday. Before the holiday, hundreds of factories in Moscow, Leningrad, Donets, and the Urals had completed their February plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: TASS, Moscow, February 23rd: Marshal Bulganin, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, issued an order on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, stating: "The Soviet people are welcoming the 30th anniversary of their armed forces while struggling to victoriously realize the post-war five-year plan. The Soviet people express their full support for the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and they also express their determination to overcome any difficulties and obstacles on the road to realizing the great goal of building a communist society. We should not forget that as long as imperialism exists, the danger of our country being attacked will still exist. The situation forces us to be constantly prepared for battle. The Soviet Union firmly pursues its peace-loving foreign policy, stands at the forefront of progressive forces, and fights for the consolidation and lasting democratic peace, and for the security of all countries. This just Stalinist foreign policy is supported by the people's democratic countries and all freedom-loving and peace-loving friends in the world. The task of our armed forces is to guard this policy."
