    County and District Cadres Protect Village Cadres, Forming an Anti-People Clique
    Supplementary Regiment Three Soldiers File Complaint
    To the Comrades in charge of the People's Daily:
    We are from Donglizhuang, Second District, Qiu County, Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region. We are currently studying in the Second Supplementary Regiment of the Military Region. We are soldiers. Now that we are studying the Land Law Outline, we understand that we must allow poor and hired peasants to thoroughly stand up, no longer oppressed by landlords, rich peasants, cadres, and ungrateful bad cadres. Therefore, we ask the newspaper to publish our opinions, correct the dark phenomena in our village, and enable poor and hired peasants to achieve a thorough transformation in land and politics.
    Xie Jinqing's family is a rich peasant, with more than 70 mu of land, 24 rooms, one ox, and a family of five. The land is all good land. During famine years, they had more than 100 mu of land, later selling off 30 mu. They live a landlord's life. Xie Jinqing's wife is the director of the Women's Association, a loose woman who has had a relationship with the village head, Xie Xuelin, for 18 years. Her eldest son is the director of the Farmers' Association, already given to his uncle as a son, also a rich peasant, and is a dictatorial ruler in the village, feared by poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants alike. Xie Hongqi, a desperately poor peasant, is the leader of the Farmers' Association group, and his wife is the deputy director of the Women's Association. Because they worked actively and opposed the director of the Women's Association protecting the family members of the traitor Zhang Sumei, they offended the director of the Farmers' Association, the director of the Women's Association, and the village head. As a result, Xie Hongqi is now in the county government prison, and the deputy director was removed from her position and told to confess to the masses.
    Xie Xuelv, a poor peasant, is the director of the trade union. Because of unfair distribution of fruit, he raised objections to the director of the Farmers' Association and the village head, and as a result, he was tied up and beaten by the militia, removed from his position, and expelled from the Farmers' Association. Xie Liang, a desperately poor peasant, was beaten more than ten times by village cadres because he spoke carelessly and liked to say strange things about the village cadres. Xie Jiujin, an activist, was beaten twice by village cadres for opposing corruption and forced to join the army, and has been gone for three years.
    Xie Xuelin used to be a puppet Bao trưởng (head of a Bao, an administrative division), and became the village head as soon as the Eighth Route Army arrived, and has not been replaced for more than ten years. The masses have requested his replacement three times, but he has not been replaced. When returning to the team this year, he protected his brother-in-law and did not allow him to return to the team. He also protects Xie Xuexin at home (a deserter), and is a tyrannical demon in the village.
    Why are they able to flaunt their power? The main reason is that county and district cadres support them. Xie Qingji, a district cadre from a large landlord family, supports them and gives them ideas. When Zhang, the Minister of the County Armed Forces Committee (Wenzhu), and Guo, the Director of the District Armed Forces Committee (Xinmin), came to the village, the village cadres treated them like gods, providing them with wine and meat. At the same time, they divided the Farmers' Association's 30 mu of good land to the two of them, ordering the villagers and militia to cultivate it for them. Zhang Wenzhu's land has been cultivated for him for two years, and Guo Xinmin's land has been planted for three years and now sold, selling for 8,000 yuan per mu, putting the money in their own pockets.
    The masses once wanted to struggle against the director of the Women's Association, and the loose woman was so frightened that she ran to Zhang Wenzhu's house, wrote a letter, and returned to the village as director, still oppressing the masses. Zhang Wenzhu wrote a letter to the masses threatening them, saying: Do not allow her to be replaced, the director treats people well. In this way, the masses were suppressed. The village head's older brother is the head of the self-defense force, raping Xie Xueli's wife, also openly. Families who have been struggled against often invite these village cadres to eat and drink, and the masses dare not speak.
    Do the two county and district cadres also divide the fruits in their homes, and do they go to various villages to divide the Farmers' Association's land? Is it right for District Cadre Guo Xinmin to sell 15 mu of land from our village? Is it right for District Cadre Jia Shumei to privately sell 27,000 public bricks and embezzle local public grain accounts before running to the district to become a cadre? Is it right for Jia Xinzhi, the director of the Joint Defense Zone, to force the daughter of a landlord to marry him, and at the same time protect his older brother from returning to the team?
    The above is our opinion, which is indeed fact. If there is half a lie, we are willing to be punished. Please investigate in detail.
    Soldiers Xie Jinzhong, Xie Jinjian, Jia Zhongde of the Second Supplementary Regiment of the Military Region, January 30th

    县区干部包庇村干  形成反人民小集团
    补充团三战士提出控诉人民日报负责同志：
    我们是冀南邱县二区东里庄人。我们现在都在大军区补二团学习。我们是战士。现在学习土地法大纲，了解到要叫贫雇农彻底翻身，不再受地主富农干部及忘本的坏干部压迫，因此我们请报社把我们的意见登出来，纠正我们村的黑暗现象，使贫雇在土地上、政治上得到彻底翻身。
    谢金清家是富农，家有七十余亩地，房子廿四间，一头牛，五口人。地都是好地。在灾荒年曾有地一百余亩，后来倒走三十余亩。过的是地主生活。谢金清妻是妇女会主任，是个破鞋，和村长谢学林搞了十八年关系。她大儿子是农会主任，已给他伯父当儿，也是富农，在村是独裁的统制，贫雇中农都害他们怕。赤贫谢洪奇是农会小组长，女人是妇会副主任，因工作积极，反对妇会正主任包庇汉奸家属张苏美，因而得罪了农会主任、妇会主任、村长，弄得谢洪奇现在县府住监狱，副主任撤了职，还叫向群众坦白。
    贫农谢学吕是工会主任，因分果实不公，向农会主任、村长提意见，结果叫民兵捆起来打了一顿，撤了职，并开除出农会。赤贫谢亮，因自己说话不注意，好说村干的怪话，因而叫村干打了有十几次。积极分子谢九金因反对贪污，叫村干部打了两次，逼迫参军，现已三年。
    谢学林过去当过伪保长，八路军一来就当了村长，十余年未换过。群众要求换过三次都没有换了。在今年归队时包庇他小舅子，不叫归队。又包庇谢学新在家（逃亡战士），在村是统制魔王。
    为什么他们能耀武扬威呢？主要是有县区干部给他们撑腰。大地主出身的区干部谢青吉给他们撑腰，出主意。县武委会张部长（文柱），区武委会郭主任（新民）到村后，村干部就向（象）待老天爷一样给吃酒肉，同时把农会的三十亩好地，分给他们二人，叫村里群众民兵给代耕。张文柱的地已经代耕了二年，郭新民的地种了三年，现在卖了，每亩卖了八千元。装在自己腰包里。
    群众曾经要斗妇会主任，吓的这个破鞋跑到张文柱家，写了一信，又回村当主任，还是压迫群众。张文柱给群众写信威胁说：不准换，该主任待人好。就这样把群众压下去。村长哥哥是自卫队长，强奸谢学礼女人，也是公开的。被斗户经常请这些村干部们吃酒肉，群众也不敢说话。
    县区的两个干部他们家里也分果实，他们又到各村分农会地对不对？区干部郭新民卖我村十五亩地对不对？区干贾书梅私自卖公家砖二万七千个，又贪污地方公粮帐末算，而跑到区当干部，对不对？联防区指导员贾新志强迫地主女儿成亲，同时他又包庇他哥哥不归队，对不对？
    以上是我们的意见，确是事实，如有半句谎言，愿受处分。请详细调查。
    大军区补二团战士谢金钟、谢金建、贾忠德一月三十日
