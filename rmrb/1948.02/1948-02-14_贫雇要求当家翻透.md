    Poor and Hired Peasants Demand Thorough Turnaround to Become Masters
    This village has many problems. According to the current investigation, the poor and hired peasants have five demands. First, to clear the accounts of the cooperative. How much of the fruits of struggle (including grain, timber, cotton, and furniture) placed in the cooperative is actually there? How much money has the cooperative actually earned? Second, to clear up the fruits of struggle. Originally, the three rooms of the Farmers' Association Director Duan Laiyou's house were filled with the fruits of struggle; but now only a little is left, and it is all bad. When village cadres moved the fruits of struggle, the militia stood guard, not allowing the masses to go out, saying it was "martial law." Third, to cleanse the old rich from the cooperative. Fourth, cadres should return the excessively occupied fruits [of struggle]. Fifth, to demand to be the masters [of their own affairs]. Poor peasant Duan Tingyu said: "Not daring to speak is a big deal, retaliation follows if you offer an opinion." Veteran Duan Zhuhua said: "We must transfer cadres and hand over power to the poor. If these cadres continue to lead, the poor cannot be the masters and dare not speak."

    贫雇要求当家翻透
    这村的问题很多。根据现在的调查，看到贫雇有五项要求。第一是清理合作社帐目。要弄清放在合作社的斗争果实（连粮食、木材、棉花、家具在内）倒底有多少？合作社倒底赚了多少钱？第二是清理斗争果实。原来农会主任段来有家的三间房子，装满了斗争果实；可是现在只剩了一点点，还是坏的。村干部搬斗争果实时，民兵站上岗，不准群众出门，说是“戒严”。第三是清洗合作社的老财。第四是干部退出多占果实。第五是要求当家。贫农段廷玉说：“不敢说话是个大事，一提意见就报复。”退伍军人段祝华说：“要调换干部，把权转给穷人。还是这些干部领导，穷人就当不了家，也不敢说话。”
