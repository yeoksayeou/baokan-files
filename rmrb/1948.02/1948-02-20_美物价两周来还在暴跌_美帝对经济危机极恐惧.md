Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: New York dispatch: The plunge in American prices and stocks, which began on the 4th, has lasted for two weeks and still shows a trend of continuing to fall. According to a business and financial report released by the Associated Press on the 15th, "The prices of butter, meat, flour, sugar, lard, and other oils are all lower than last week, and further price drops are very likely." "In the Chicago Board of Trade, the prices of wheat, corn, and oats have fallen as if into a bottomless abyss, falling dollar by dollar." The average index of thirty-five American commodities fell to 191.65 last week on the 9th, and then plummeted to around 186 on the 15th of this week; compared with mid-January, the decline has exceeded 21 percent. The Associated Press called it "an unprecedentedly rapid one" in American history. The prices of stocks and securities continue to fall, "the psychological state in the market at the weekend is still one of anxiety," and it is especially worth noting that at this time, the Swiss Bank, the economic nerve center of Europe, declared in its recently released annual report: "There are now all indications that the world business cycle has passed its peak," meaning that the world economic crisis is about to come, and therefore the Associated Press has to tremble and say: The Swiss Bank's report is "of great significance."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Various dispatches: The trend of falling American prices and stock prices was still continuing as of the 15th when foreign news agencies sent their dispatches. According to a dispatch from the National News Agency on the 15th quoting Moscow Radio, "The current price drop in the United States is very similar to the situation before the economic crisis in 1929." Although brokers from major companies are announcing every day: "The worst is over," prices are still falling. On the 13th, in the Chicago grain market, corn and soybeans fell another eight cents per bushel, wheat fell another five cents, butter fell three to five and a half cents, and beef fell seven and a half cents. Cotton, rubber, and leather also continued to fall in price. On the same day, prices in New York also continued to fall, with the prices of flour, cured meat, ham, lard, vegetable oil, eggs, butter, beef, and pork all still falling. Wholesale meat prices have fallen by as much as five cents. On the 14th, "Washington housewives' shopping lists show that the retail prices of butter, meat, and several other foods have further decreased" (Associated Press). On the same day, "the Chicago grain market was only open for half a day, and some commodities were even suspended from trading" (United Press). In terms of stock and securities trading, "brokers from major companies are anxiously pacing the floor of the stock exchange again" (Moscow Radio), and the stock prices of Mellon Company's steel trust "Anaconda" and "American Smelting Company" are all falling (Associated Press). This situation has forced some American experts to admit: "Prices will continue to fall." Merchants dare not predict market conditions, and American monopoly capitalists are filled with fear of economic crisis (revealed by Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency). Not only that, but Brazil in South America has also been impacted by the sharp drop in American prices. On the 15th, Brazilian coffee fell by three and a third cents per bag, and cotton fell by two cents per bale.

    美物价两周来还在暴跌
    美帝对经济危机极恐惧
    【新华社陕北十八日电】纽约讯：四日开始的美国物价与股票证券的暴跌已达两周，迄今仍呈现继续下跌之势。据美联社十五日所发表的一周商情与金融的报告中称：“本周牛油、肉类、面粉、糖、猪油及他种油类的价格，均低于上周，进一步跌价也很可能”。“芝加哥贸易所中，小麦、玉蜀黍和燕麦价格的下跌就象陷入无底的深渊一般，一元一元的跌下来”。三十五种美国商品的平均指数，在上周的九日曾跌至一九一点六五，而至本周的十五日，又急剧降落至一八六左右；与一月中旬相较，下跌已超过百分之二十一。美联社称之为美国历史上“空前急速的一次”。股票证券的价格仍继续下跌，“周末市场上的心理状态依然是一种惴惴不安的情况”，尤其值得重视的，即恰在此时，欧洲经济神经中枢的瑞士银行，在其最近发表的年报中宣称：“现在已有一切迹象，证明世界商业周期已经越过最高峰了”，意即世界经济危机即将到来，因而美联社对此不得不战栗的说：瑞士银行的报告，“富有重大意义”。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方讯：美国物价与股票价格的跌风，至外国通讯社十五日发电时为止，仍在继续中，据国新社十五日引莫斯科广播称：“美国目前的物价下跌，已与一九二九年经济危机前的情况极为相似”。虽然各大公司的经纪人每天都在宣告：“最坏的情况已经过了”，但物价却仍在继续下跌。十三日，芝加哥粮食市场的玉蜀黍和大豆，每蒲式尔又下跌八分，小麦又下跌五分，牛油跌价三分至五分半，牛肉跌价七分半。棉花、橡胶和皮革亦继续跌价。同日的纽约物价亦继续下降，面粉、腌肉、火腿、猪油、菜油、蛋类、牛油、牛肉及猪肉的价格，都仍下跌，肉类批发价格已跌落五分钱之多。十四日，“华盛顿主妇们的购物单上，显示出牛油、肉类和另外几种食物的零售价格，又进一步的降低”（美联社）。同日，“芝加哥谷物市场仅仅营业半日，某些商品甚至停市”（合众社）。在股票证券交易方面，“各大公司经纪人又在股票交易所的地板上，焦急的踱着步子”（莫斯科广播），而资本雄厚的梅隆公司的钢铁托拉斯“安纳康达”和“美国冶炼公司”的股票价格都在下跌（美联社）。此种情形，已使美国某些专家不得不承认：“物价将继续下跌”。商人不敢预测行情，而美国独占资本家则充满着对经济危机的恐惧（蒋匪中央社的透露），不仅如此，南美的巴西也已受到美国物价暴跌的冲击，在十五日，巴西咖啡每袋跌价三角三分，棉花每包跌价二角。
