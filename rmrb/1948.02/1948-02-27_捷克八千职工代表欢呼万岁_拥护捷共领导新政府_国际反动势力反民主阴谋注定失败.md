　　Prague dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: The National Congress of Trade Unions, representing 2.5 million workers and staff from major factories, mines, and institutions across Czechoslovakia, was held here on the 22nd. The 8,000 delegates at the congress listened with great excitement to the speech delivered by Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Prime Minister. He pointed out: "Only the working people have the right to decide what is in the interest of the Republic. Domestic and foreign reactionaries are attempting to undermine our people's democratic regime, hand the government over to reactionary politicians, and allow the Republic to return to the dark rule before Munich. However, this is absolutely impossible. The strength of the working masses and the democratic forces of our country is so great that they are fully capable of crushing the conspiracy of the reactionaries. In my capacity as Prime Minister, I tell you that the government remains at its post and will realize the will of the working people. The government will do everything in its power to fulfill the demands of the working people, maintain and consolidate the people's democratic system, and prepare for free and democratic elections." The last sentence of Gottwald's speech was drowned out by thunderous applause and roaring cheers. The entire venue shouted, "Long live the new Gottwald government! Long live our best friend, the Soviet Union!" The congress resolved to hold a one-hour national warning strike on the 24th to express support for the Gottwald government. Additionally, people across Czechoslovakia have been continuously holding mass rallies and demonstrations for days, demanding that President Beneš accept the resignation of the ministers from the three reactionary parties and establish a new government of people's democracy. The government has received thousands of resolutions and letters from the people expressing their support for days.

　　Moscow dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: An international observer in Pravda commented on the 22nd on the situation in Czechoslovakia: The anti-democratic conspiracy of international reactionary forces is intensifying as the Czech elections approach. Reactionary forces are using certain parties that have infiltrated the coalition government as tools, and the National Socialist Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party, three parties participating in the National Front, have become shelters for those who harbor anti-people views and purposes. The observer pointed out the reasons for the resignation of the three party ministers: The considerable achievements of people's democracy and the victorious progress of the Two-Year Plan, the increasing prestige of the Communist Party, and the Gottwald government's pursuit of saboteurs filled all the running dogs of reactionary forces with panic, fearing exposure of their relationship with the country's enemies abroad. Therefore, at the cabinet meeting, the three party ministers refused to listen to the reports from the Minister of Interior and the Minister of National Defense on the cracking of the Most espionage system. The three parties jointly participated in the conspiracy against the Czech National Front, and their resignation was in accordance with orders from abroad, attempting to cause a government crisis with this irresponsible behavior. The observer judged that the conspiracy of international reactionary forces is doomed to fail because the Czech people have shown that they will not tolerate the slightest compromise with treasonous policies. They demand that the agents of reactionary forces, the enemies of the National Front, be purged from the government. Hundreds of thousands of workers, staff, and peasants unanimously support the Gottwald government. The Czech people are determined to oppose all reactionary conspiracies and defend the Republic.

　　捷克八千职工代表欢呼万岁
  　拥护捷共领导新政府
    国际反动势力反民主阴谋注定失败
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】布拉格讯：代表捷克各大工厂、矿山、机关二百五十万工人和职员的职工会全国代表大会，二十二日在此间举行，大会八千名代表以极兴奋的心情听取捷共主席内阁总理哥特瓦尔德向大会的演说。他指出：“只有劳动人民才有权决定什么东西符合共和国的利益。国内和国外的反动派企图破坏我国人民民主政权，把政府交给反动政客，让共和国退回到慕尼黑以前的黑暗统治。然而这是绝对办不到的，劳动大众的力量，我们国家的民主力量是如此强大，他们完全能够粉碎反动派的阴谋。我以总理的身份告诉你们，政府仍然坚持自己的岗位，并将实现劳动人民的意志。政府将尽其一切努力，履行劳动人民的要求，保持与巩固人民民主制度；并筹备自由民主的选举”。哥氏演说的最后一句话，为群众雷动的掌声与如潮的欢呼所淹没。全场高呼“哥特瓦尔德新政府万岁！我们最好的朋友苏联万岁！”大会决议二十四日举行全国警告罢工一小时，表示对哥特瓦尔德政府的支持。又：全捷各地人民连日不断举行群众集会与示威游行，要求贝奈斯总统接受三反动政党各部长的辞职，成立人民民主的新政府。政府连日收到人民表示拥护的决议与信件数以千计。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家于二十二日评捷克局势说：国际反动势力的反民主阴谋，随着捷克大选临近而加紧。反动势力利用钻入联合政府的某些党派作为工具，而民族社会党、基督教人民党和斯洛伐克民主党三个参加民族阵线的党派，成了那些暗藏反人民观点和目的者的避难所。观察家指出三党部长辞职的原因说：人民民主可观的成就和两年计划胜利的进行，共产党声望的增高，哥特瓦尔德政府对破坏分子的追究，使一切反动势力的走狗，充满了惊慌，唯恐暴露出自己与国外共和国公敌的关系，所以在内阁会议上，三党部长拒绝听取内政部长和国防部长关于破获莫斯特城间谍系统的报告。三党共同参加了反对捷克民族阵线的阴谋，他们的辞职是遵循国外的命令，企图以这种不负责任的行为引起政府的危机。观察家判断：国际反动势力的阴谋注定要失败的，因为捷克人民表明了决不容许和叛国政策有丝毫妥协的立场。他们要求把反动势力的代理人，民族阵线的敌人，清除出政府。成千成万工人职员和农民一致拥护哥特瓦尔德政府。捷克人民决心反对一切反动阴谋，保卫共和国。
