    Quickly Correct This Unreasonable Phenomenon:
    Village Head Issues Pass, Telling Poor Peasants to Beg Along the Village
    To the Editors:
    We are students from the direct institute of the Rear Field Hospital General Hospital, stationed in a village in Guantao. Since the land reform last year, we haven't seen any beggars. Today, we suddenly encountered an old man, over fifty years old, wearing clothes with countless patches, begging from door to door. We felt very strange. We poor people are of one heart, so Comrade Liu Ling gave him her allowance and asked about his background. According to him, he is Chen Jinlong from Xiao Village, Fourth District of Guantao. His family consists of four people: two young girls and a blind wife who has been begging since she was a child. He said that they still have no way to live. He has been begging all along. He did not receive any fruits of the land reform last year, so they still have to beg. His pass reads: "This is to certify that Chen Jinlong, a poor peasant from this village, has no way to make a living and is allowed to beg in various villages." It bears the official seal of the village office and the personal seal of Village Head Li Shoushen. We didn't believe this was true, so we investigated with the local masses and village cadres, and it turned out to be true. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to publish this, fearing that there may be similar phenomena in other places. From this incident, it can be seen that our land reform is not thorough enough. We should pay more attention, especially to smoothly implement the Central Committee's promulgated Land Law Outline. We have seen that in some villages, landlords still wear fancy clothes and live comfortable lives. Such things are too unreasonable. It is impossible for the poor to completely turn themselves over without thoroughly crushing the landlords. We hope that the relevant responsible cadres will pay attention.

    赶快纠正这种不合理的现象
    村长开上通行证  叫贫农沿村讨饭编者同志：
    我们是后方野战医院总院直属所学员，驻于馆陶某庄。自去年进行土地改革后，没见过要饭的人。今天忽然碰到一个五十余岁的老头，身穿千层补绽的衣服，沿门乞食。我们很觉奇怪，咱们穷人是一个心，刘玲同志就将津贴费送了他。并询问其来历。据他说是馆陶第四区肖村人，名叫陈金龙，家内四口人，两个小女孩，一个老婆是瞎子，从小讨饭，一直至今。去年土地改革未分果实，仍无法生活，所以仍要饭。他的通行证上写着：“兹有本村贫农陈金龙无法生活，到各庄要饭。”按着村公所公章，与村长李寿绅的手章。我们还未相信实情，便向当地群众、村干调查，确是如此。所以我们写信请贵报发表，恐怕其它地方也有这样现象。从这件事看，我们的土地改革是不够彻底的。特别为顺利执行中央颁布之土地法大纲，更应注意。我们看到有些村子的地主仍穿红挂绿，过着舒适的生活，这样的事情太不合理，不能彻底摧垮地主，穷人翻透身是不可能的，希有关的负责干部注意。        （郝金苏、刘玲一月二十六日）
