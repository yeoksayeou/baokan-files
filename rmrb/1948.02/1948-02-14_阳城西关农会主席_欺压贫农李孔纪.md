    Yangcheng Xiguan Farmers' Association Chairman
    Oppresses Poor Peasant Li Kongji

    The chairman of the Yangcheng Xiguan Farmers' Association oppresses employed and poor peasant Li Kongji. For two years, Li Kongji swallowed his bitterness, and only today dares to speak out. Li Kongji is already sixty-eight years old this year, and has spent his life doing odd jobs and living in landlords' homes, and has been continuously oppressed by the chairman of the Farmers' Association. The major incidents are these: He and the village Farmers' Association Vice Chairman Song Chunyong live in the same courtyard and are nominally in the same mutual aid group. Once, Li Kongji finally exchanged labor to get Song Chunyong's ox labor to plow the land. After plowing for only half a day, when he returned for lunch, Song Chunyong started cursing: "Damn it, it's not your ox, so you don't care about it. You plowed four mu of land in half a day, you're killing my ox!" Li Kongji said: "You are also a working person, how can you plow four mu of land in half a day? It's obviously only plowed more than one mu, and you say four mu." Song Chunyong immediately became furious and cursed, "You are farting and talking nonsense!" and raised his hand to strike. Li Kongji said, "You still want to hit me?" Song Chunyong said, "Hitting you will only dirty my hands." And from then on, he wouldn't let him use the ox anymore. In the summer, Li Kongji had only harvested half of his one mu of wheat field, and the ox of Zhang Shuangrong, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, ate the remaining half that was left behind. Li Kongji asked, "Why did you eat my wheat?" Zhang Shuangrong said, "I thought you didn't want it anymore." But Li Kongji was afraid of the cadres and dared not say a word, and kept it bottled up in his heart. Once, a woman was dragging white steamed buns to visit relatives, and Zhang Shuangrong met her and said, "We must be thrifty and not waste." At that time, Li Kongji's wife couldn't help but interject and say, "Is thriftiness meant for feeding oxen!" Zhang Shuangrong became furious when he heard this and said, "You don't need to say that. How much wheat did my ox eat from you? How much wheat should I compensate you? I don't want to hear you say this." But he didn't compensate even a single grain of wheat. Kongji's house was burned down by the Japanese devils, so he lived in his son-in-law's house. His son-in-law followed the enemy in the Japanese gendarmerie. Taking advantage of his son-in-law's position, he built a latrine. When his son-in-law's property was confiscated, the latrine was also confiscated. Song Chunyong then gave the latrine to Song Zihe, who was the object of struggle, for use, and even instructed Song Zihe to have Li Kongji dig out the feces, because it was too cold to empty the latrine, so he had to work with the object of struggle. In the past, he got very little fruit in the struggle for emancipation. Li Kongji's son, who was a laborer, worked very hard in the militia, but he didn't get any fruit when the fruit was distributed. During the great struggle the year before last, Li Kongji went to distribute the fruit. Yan Xiuqin, the accountant of the Farmers' Association, said, "You came late, the fruit has all been distributed." Others saw that Li Kongji was starving and said, "Let's give the old man a little bit of what we have." Yan Xiuqin was still unwilling, but he said it nicely, "You are so old and said it, I can't let you lose face, I'll give you some next time." The laborer secretly told his father, if they don't give it to us, we don't want it, we don't dare to say more, we can do without it. When filling in the gaps, he was only given five dou of rice, and later he was given some pots and pans, nothing of value. It wasn't until last summer that he was given three mu of land, two mu of which were given to him after others had harvested the wheat. Li Kongji said: Others bully us, and we can't say anything, I look carefully before I dare to take a step, I'm just afraid that people (referring to cadres) will cause trouble.

    阳城西关农会主席
    欺压贫农李孔纪
    阳城西关农会主席，欺压雇贫农李孔纪。两年来李孔纪苦水往肚里咽，今天才敢说出来。李孔纪今年已有六十八岁，一辈子打忙工住主家，一直被农会主席欺压，大的就有这几件：他和村农会副主席宋春雍住一个院，名义上还在一个互助组。有一次，李孔纪好容易拿人工换了宋春雍的牛工犁地，刚犁了一晌回来吃饭，宋春雍就骂起来：妈的，不是你的牛你不心疼，一晌就犁四亩地，把我的牛累死哩！李孔纪说：你也是做活人，一晌怎么能犁四亩地，明明才犁了一亩多，你说四亩。宋春雍立刻大怒大骂道：“你放屁胡说”，说着举掌要打，李孔纪说：“你还想打我哩？”宋春雍说：“打你怕你脏了我的手。”就此牛也不叫用了。夏天，李孔纪一亩麦地才割了一半，农会主席张双荣的牛把丢下的一半就吃了，李孔纪问：“怎么把我的麦子吃了？”张双荣说：“我当你不要了。”可是李孔纪怕干部，不敢哼声，心里闷着。有一回，有一个妇女拖着白馍馍去探亲戚，张双荣碰见说：“要节约不要浪费。”当时李孔纪的老婆，耐不住就插嘴说：“节约不是叫喂牛哩！”张双荣一听老羞成怒说：“你不用说这话，我的牛吃了你多少麦子？赔你多少麦，我不愿听你这话。”可是并没有赔一颗麦。孔纪的房子被日本鬼子烧了就住着他女婿的房子，他女婿在日本人警备队里跟敌人走了，借女婿的地位搞了一个毛厕，没收他女婿财产时，把茅厕也没收了。宋春雍又把茅厕交给斗争对象宋子和使用了，还指使宋子和叫李孔纪把粪挖走，因为天冷没法腾茅厕，只得和斗争对象伙起来。过去翻身斗争中分得果实很少，李孔纪儿子老板在民兵里干的很有劲，可是分果实时没分。前年大斗争时，李孔纪去分果实，农会管帐的延秀钦说：“你来的晚了，果实都分了。”别人见李孔纪饿慌就说：“我们少分点给老汉分点吧。”延秀钦还是不愿意，但说得很好听：“你这么大年纪说出了口，不能让你丢脸，等下回给你分点。”老板暗暗说他爹，不分给咱就不要，咱不敢多说话，咱吃不么。到填平补齐时，才给分了五斗米，后来又分了一些罐罐锅锅，没有值钱的东西。直到去年夏天才分给了三亩地，有二亩是别人割了麦才给他的。李孔纪说：人家欺负咱不行，也不敢哼气，我看准了才敢迈步，光怕人家（指干部）找麻烦。（太岳分社来电）
