The Soviet Supreme Soviet held its Fourth Congress on the 30th of last month and has now successfully concluded. The Congress passed the national budget for 1948, which is the largest budget in the Soviet Union's history during peacetime. It stipulates that funds for the national economy and social and cultural undertakings account for 68% of the total expenditures, while defense expenditures account for only 17%. This new budget has two major characteristics: first, the balance between revenue and expenditure has a large surplus (this year's revenue exceeds expenditure by as much as 40.1 billion rubles), which is in sharp contrast to the financial exhaustion and frequent large budget deficits of capitalist countries, indicating the strength of the Soviet Union and the superiority of the Soviet financial system; second, it is for the benefit of the people and the just cause of defending world democratic peace, on the one hand "sparing no effort to strengthen national defense" (Pravda), and on the other hand, striving to develop the national economy and improve the happiness of the Soviet people.

The cause of peace and democracy in Eastern Europe has made significant progress this week. The Soviet Union signed the Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance on the 4th, "which is another strong fortress against new aggression and plundering imperialist plans." At the same time, Hungary and Romania concluded a twenty-year mutual assistance treaty and then signed a cultural cooperation agreement with Poland. The Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party have agreed to form a unified workers' party, and all peasant parties have also merged to form a unified organization of the working people. In Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front held its second national congress, elected a new leadership with Dimitrov as chairman, and the merger of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party is also underway. From all this, it is not difficult to see that the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe are further consolidating their internal affairs, and strengthening their cooperation with the Soviet Union through mutual solidarity.

The people's movements in France, Italy, and Germany are continuing to expand and deepen.

In Italy, the People's Democratic Front held its first national congress on the 1st and adopted the Front's charter. This is the first new democratic charter in Italian history, stipulating the thorough reform of state institutions, the implementation of local autonomy, the nationalization of large monopolistic industries, land reform, and the confiscation of large landowners' property. Because this charter is in line with the interests of the vast majority of the Italian people, the foundation of the People's Democratic Front has become increasingly broad and solid. Now, the Italian people are enthusiastically responding to the Front's call to fight for the realization of this charter and to win the upcoming general election. The Gasperi government has been frightened out of its wits by the great unity and counterattack of the Italian people in this battle. It has no choice but to sign the humiliating "U.S.-Italy Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Agreement" and wag its tail to beg its American father; on the other hand, it is desperately recruiting former Fascist officers and soldiers into the army in order to carry out armed suppression of the people in the general election. The struggle surrounding the general election will be a signal that the decisive battle in Italy is about to come.

In France, in coordination with the heroic struggle of the workers against the reactionary authorities' traitorous and dictatorial policies, the broad masses of peasants, at the call of the French Communist Party, also held a national "Peasant Protest Day," demonstrating everywhere to oppose the emergency tax law. This proves that the French peasants have taken action to fight for the realization of the French Communist Party's program of "improving the lives of peasants and establishing a people's democratic government."

The German people's struggle against hunger has further developed, and the number of striking workers has surged to more than three million. And the movement demanding the democratic unification of Germany is still surging throughout Germany.

News from the past week confirms that "a broad democratic united front in the United States is gradually forming in the struggle against reactionary forces." (according to Zhukov of the Soviet Union) The "Wallace for President National Committee" has been formed, and the movement to support Wallace's campaign is unfolding more and more. A new development this week is that it has gained the enthusiastic support of many farmers in the East. At the same time, securities prices in the United States have clearly fallen, to a degree "seen only since February of last year" (TASS), foreshadowing that the American economic crisis is approaching. The U.S. monopoly capitalist groups are extremely panicked by this, and even Truman has had to exclaim, "Unless a way is found to stop the intensifying inflation, economic collapse is inevitable." The crisis is like a volcano, this volcano that threatens U.S. imperialism every day, and it looks like it is about to erupt. Despite U.S. imperialism's baring its fangs and brandishing its claws everywhere, the true face of this paper tiger is becoming more and more exposed.

    苏联国力强大财政制度优越
    美帝纸老虎真面貌日益暴露
    苏联最高苏维埃于上月三十日举行第四次大会，现已圆满闭幕。大会通过了一九四八年度国家预算，这是苏联和平年代历史上最大的一次预算，她规定国民经济与社会、文化事业经费，占岁出总额达百分之六十八，而国防经费仅占百分之十七。这新预算有着两大特点：第一为收支相抵盈余极大（本年度收入即超过支出达四百零一亿卢布之巨），这与资本主义国家的财政枯竭与预算经常存在庞大赤字的情况适成鲜明对照，表明了苏联国力的强大和苏维埃财政制度的优越；第二为造福人民和保卫世界民主和平的正义事业，它一方面“毫不懈怠加强国防”（真理报），另一方面尽力发展国民经济与提高苏联人民的幸福生活。
    东欧和平民主事业本周仍有显著进展。苏联已于四日与罗马尼亚签订了苏罗友好合作互助条约，“这是对抗新侵略与掠夺的帝国主义计划之又一坚强堡垒”。同时，匈牙利与罗马尼亚订立二十年互助条约后，又与波兰签订了文化合作协定。罗马尼亚共产党与社会民主党已协议筹组统一工人党，而所有农民政党亦已合并成立劳动人民的统一组织。在保加利亚，祖国阵线召开了第二届全国大会，选出了以季米特洛夫为主席的新领导机构，而保共与社会党的合并亦正进行中。这一切不难看出：东欧新民主主义各国正在更进一步巩固其内部，并互相团结加强与苏联的合作。
    法意德三国的人民运动，正在继续扩大与深入中。
    在意大利，人民民主阵线于一日召开了首届全国代表大会，并通过该阵线宪章。这是意国历史上第一部新民主主义的大宪章，它规定彻底改革国家机构，履行地方自治，实行大独占工业国有化，进行土地改革及没收大地主财产等。由于这一宪章符合意国绝大多数人民的利益，人民民主阵线的基础已愈见扩大和巩固。现在全意人民，正热烈响应该阵线的号召，为实现这一宪章和赢得行将到来的大选而斗争。加斯贝利政府在意国人民的这一战斗大团结和反攻震慑下，已吓得魂不附体。只好一方面签订丧权辱国的“美意友好通商航海协定”，向其美国爸爸摇尾乞怜；另一方面，则拼命征募前法西斯官兵入伍，以便在大选中进行对人民的武装镇压。环绕着大选的斗争，将是意国国内决定性战斗即将到来的信号。
    在法国，配合着工人们抗击反动当局卖国独裁政策的英勇斗争，广大农民在法共号召下，也举行了全国性的“农民抗议日”。到处示威游行，以反对紧急税收法。这证明法国农民已行动起来，为实现法共“改善农民生活、成立人民民主政府”的纲领而斗争了。
    德国人民反饥饿斗争更加发展，罢工工人已剧增至三百万以上。而要求德国民主统一的运动仍澎湃全德。
    一周来的消息证实：美国“广泛的民主统一阵线，正在与反动力量斗争中逐渐形成。”（苏联朱可夫语）“华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”已经组成了，拥护华莱士竞选的运动正日益展开中。本周新的发展，就是它取得了东部许多农民的热烈支持。与此同时，美国国内证券价格已显然下跌，其程度“为去年二月以来所仅见”（塔斯社），预示着美国经济危机已临大门。美国独占资本集团对此均极度恐慌，甚至杜鲁门也不得不惊呼“除非找一个制止愈演愈烈的通货膨胀之方法，否则经济崩溃不可避免”。危机就象一座火山，这座每天威胁着美帝国主义的火山，眼看着就快要爆发了，尽管美帝国主义到处张牙舞爪，这纸老虎的真面目是越来越暴露了。
