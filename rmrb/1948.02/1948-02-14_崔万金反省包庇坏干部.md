Cui Wanjin Repents for Shielding Bad Cadres
(Comrade Cui is from Niu Fort, Tenth District, Wu'an. He is 23 years old, from a very poor family, and a blacksmith by trade. He joined the Party in July 1946, started working in the district in July 1947, and is currently a member of the Tenth District Military Affairs Committee.)

My family has been blacksmiths for six generations. I started blacksmithing at the age of nine. My grandfather bought 1.8 mu of cemetery land and nine houses. In 1942, we sold the houses, and a rich neighbor forcibly bought them for 600 yuan (we could have sold them to someone else for 900 yuan). I hoped the Eighth Route Army would come to avenge us. As soon as the Eighth Route Army arrived, I became the director of the Military Affairs Committee. At that time, the village's labor organizers, secretaries, and warehouse directors were all landlords. During the Ping-Han Campaign, I worked hard, only thinking about avenging this grievance. But during this period, my thinking became tainted by the landlords. I thought that since I was a cadre, I should get some clothes. Then I started messing around with a "broken shoe." This "broken shoe" wasn't from a family that had been struggled against, but she was very rich. She would do anything for me – shoes, clothes. After messing around with her for a few months, the political commissar of the Ninth District sent a letter saying that my behavior was not good. When we struggled against this woman, I didn't agree in my heart and actively covered up for the "broken shoe." Comrade Yang Fengtong sent a letter saying that if I continued like this, I would have no status; if I worked hard, I would have status. My thinking changed a little, and later, because I worked well, I joined the Party.

When I went to Anyang to participate in the turning-over team, I thought I finally had status. I got myself a wife and then participated in the turning-over team in six or seven days. I went to Jiang Village in the Sixth District of Anyang. The district chief used to be a temple keeper and didn't have much ability. I looked down on him. Whenever there was something to do, he would discuss it with me and ask me what to do. I looked down on him for being a temple keeper; this was forgetting my roots and looking down on the Party.

When I was working in Gangtou Village, Ma Xuerong was the village chief and acting political director. He was very bad. His brother was a militiaman. When the higher-ups called for expanding the army, they said we shouldn't force people but mobilize them. He didn't mobilize his own brother. The public security officer was in the same family as him, and he said, "Whoever mobilizes him, he will jump into the well." The masses said, "If we expel him from the army expansion team, the bad egg will be gone, and it will be easier to expand the army." Someone volunteered and suggested others, and suddenly six people were found. First, I blocked the director of the Military Affairs Committee, and as a result, several people were exposed. Now I检讨 that I didn't do well at that time. The masses pointed out that the public security officer was bad, and I promised to resolve it, but after the soldiers left, I didn't do anything about it. The public security officer was a Party member, and I shielded all of these people. This is forgetting my roots.

Marriage problem: There was an eighteen-year-old girl who wanted to terminate her marriage, and I gave her a divorce, preparing for my subordinate cadres to marry her. My intention was to gain a good reputation.

My thoughts these past few days: I am very willing to learn and want to open my mind. But when I listened to the report, I felt ashamed to talk about my own affairs and was afraid that the Party wouldn't want me. After talking with the county Party committee, I thought I must tell the truth, and in the future, I must let the masses know. If I don't tell the truth, I will be letting everyone down. The county Party committee said, "You are a worker; where does your wavering come from?" I haven't figured it out yet; I will think about it again and must figure it out.

### 崔万金反省包庇坏干部

    崔万金反省包庇坏干部
    （崔同志武安十区牛＠堡人，现年廿三岁，家庭赤贫，出身铁匠。一九四六年七月入党，四七年七月到区工作，现任十区武委会委员）。
    我家六辈打铁为生。我九岁就打铁。我爷买了一亩八分坟地，九间房子。四二年卖房子，财主邻家用六百元强买走了（卖给别人得九百元）。盼八路军过来好报仇。八路军一来，我就当了武委会主任。那时村上的抗勤、书记、仓库主任等都是地主。平汉战役，干的有劲，光想报这股仇。但这一阶段，我的思想与地主沾染起了变化。心想当了干部，要弄个衣裳。又搞起破鞋来了。这个破鞋不是斗争户，可很有钱。啥也给做，鞋、衣裳。搞了几个月破鞋，九区政委来了个信，说我作风不好了。斗争这个女人，我心不同意，工作积极，掩护破鞋。杨风同同志来了一个信，说我如此下去没地位，好好干有地位。思想稍转变了点，后来工作好就入了党。
    到安阳参加翻身队，我说可有了地位了。搞下老婆，六七天就参加翻身队。到安阳六区江村。区长过去是个看庙的，能力不大。我看不起他。有事他就和我商量，问我怎么办。我看起他看庙，这是忘本，看不起党。
    我在岗头村工作，马学荣是村长，代理政治主任。他很不好。他弟当民兵。上级号召扩军时不能强迫，叫动员。群众动员他兄弟他不去。公安员和他是一家，他说：“谁动员他，他就跳井。”群众说：“要开除他扩兵组，坏蛋出去，兵就好扩了。”有一个人自动报名，并提出别人，这一下弄起来六个人。首先我先卡住武委会主任，结果弄出来几个。现在检讨那时没有作好，群众提出公安员坏，我答应解决，结果兵走了，我就不管了。公安员是党员，这些我都包庇了，这是忘本。
    婚姻问题：有个十八岁的闺女，要解除婚约，我就给他离了婚，准备给我下边的干部结婚。我的用意是想落个好。
    我这几天的思想：我很愿意学习，要开脑筋。结果一听报告，觉得自己的事说出来丢人、怕党不要。经过县委一谈，我想一定要说，将来一定要叫群众知道。不谈出来，谁也对不住。县委说：“你是个工人，动摇性从哪里来？”我还没想好，我再想一想，一定要想好。
