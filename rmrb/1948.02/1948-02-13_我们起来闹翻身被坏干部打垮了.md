Farmers:

    Our newspaper welcomes everyone to denounce the crimes of landlords here, expose shortcomings in our work, promote those things that our farmers think are good and appropriate, and put forward their own demands and suggestions for improving work. All organizations, groups, and individuals that everyone mentions must state their position. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to everyone's opinions should accept them and act accordingly. If there are any inaccuracies, explanations can be given and differing opinions can be put forward.

    Those who can write, write themselves. Those who cannot write can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write. Or come to the newspaper office yourself. If that doesn't work, write a letter to the newspaper, give us a heads up, and we can figure out a way.

Dear Editors:

    I am from Lin County, Henan. My name is Fu Xiaoyuan. At home, I was so exploited and oppressed by the landlords that I couldn't survive. In the year the Japanese attacked Changzhi, my family of eight begged for food to Dong Chongxian Village in Huguan County, Shanxi. After saying thousands of good words, we rented seven dilapidated houses from the landlord Ping Fugui, paying a rent of one stone and three dou of rice per year. That was the official price. During the New Year and festivals, we had to buy several catties of meat and several catties of wine as gifts. During the busy farming season, we had to give several days of labor as extra thanks. After finding the houses, my family still didn't have a single piece of land. My father had to open a small shop, the women spun and wove, and I carried small loads and cultivated wasteland to make a living. We slowly cultivated the wasteland to five mu.

    In recent years, the Communist Party has called on us to rise up, organize ourselves, and fight against the landlords. But because the main cadres in the village were landlords and hooligans, they tightly protected the landlords, causing our movements to fail every time. The stone slab was not lifted, but instead pressed down even harder. Wang Taishun's father was the village chief in the old society, and Wang Taishun is now the political director in the new society. A nod of his head, a word from his mouth, and the earth shakes. Cheng Shenfu is the deputy village chief. In the past, consuming opium, gambling, and whoring were his daily routine. Jiang Chengshui was a triple-faced village chief when the enemy and the stubborn were around, and later he became our labor support. These people hold great power, and which of the masses is not afraid of them with a word? These people don't do any work, they gamble and whore all day long. It's impossible to talk about them leading us to liberation. And every movement, they suppress us.

    In 1942, when we rose up to fight for liberation, they suppressed us poor people, making it so we didn't dare to say much, let alone reduce rent. In 1944, movements started again in various places. The cadres didn't lead us to do anything, and we didn't dare to struggle. Luckily, Political Commissar Li and Comrade Zhao from the district came to work. They told us that as long as we worked together, we could completely liberate ourselves even if the cadres didn't lead us. The district office stood up for us, and the poor people became bolder. At this time, the landlord Ping Fugui threatened us, saying that his brother was a Communist and making an eight-finger gesture, telling us not to struggle. We were not afraid and became even more determined. Bi Kuize, Zhang Chouze, Guo Donggui, and others, who had no food to eat, used their own suffering to mobilize our poor friends to fight against the landlords. Just then, Political Commissar Li left for a meeting. The landlords and cadres seized the opportunity to counterattack us. That night, there were especially many people in the winter school. The landlord's family, big and small, all came, standing very tall, their faces full of smiles. We saw that the situation was not right and passed the word to the poor people to completely move to another place to discuss. Who knew that the cadres had already posted four or five militiamen at the door, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, and none of us could get out. What to do? We passed the word a second time, telling everyone not to express any opinions tonight, to observe the situation and act accordingly, assuming they couldn't eliminate all of us dozens of poor people. We huddled together, not saying a word, staring with our eyes. The political director and other cadres started talking. The first thing they said was that we wanted to fight against the Shanxi people, and that the local people should unite to deal with us. The second thing they did was label us as spies, saying that we were holding a spy meeting. They had the landlord's son, who was in the militia, tie up me and Zhang Chouze. The Communist Party called on us to fight for liberation, and district cadres personally led us, but now we had become spies. Everyone couldn't help but want to fight them, but they thought that we were unarmed, and they had power and guns, so we could only endure it. As long as Political Commissar Li came tomorrow, we would have a solution. Me and Zhang Chouze were detained in the freezing Guanyin Temple and were even force-fed feces. Fortunately, the person who went to the district to send a message was fast, and Political Commissar Li sent a letter, which prevented them from hanging us up. The next day at dawn, Political Commissar Li and Comrade Zhao rushed over. We asked Comrade Zhao if he would stand up for us to the end. Comrade Zhao replied that he was going to another village and told us not to lose heart, that one day we would completely liberate ourselves. Political Commissar Li was still here. Things got worse afterward, and the power to lead the movement was handed back to the cadres. We became the target of struggle again. Guo Chegui, who had no land to cultivate and no food to eat, earned a few dou of rice by playing the drum, the lowest occupation in the old society, was accused of feudal exploitation, received a beating, and his rice and drum were taken away. Zhang Chouze was a tenant farmer and was beaten three times in three days. One beating a day was unbearable, so Zhang Chouze and I discussed that there was only one way out: to find our old roots and join the People's Liberation Army. Zhang Chouze left his mother, who had no food to eat, and joined the army. The poor people's liberation movement was crushed by these bullies and landlords. The bullies ate openly. Wang Taishun was promoted from political director to administrator in the public security bureau, and Jiang Chengshui was promoted from labor support to village chief.

    In the winter of 1945, the landlords were afraid that we would fight again, so they talked with the district chief at the district office and asked me to move out of the village and vacate the seven houses I was renting. District Chief Song Shihong (female) gave a verdict in accordance with the landlord's wishes. I was not convinced and went to the county to find Deputy County Chief Zhou, who wrote a letter allowing me to move after the New Year. The letter angered District Chief Song, who glared and said: Even if you find the county chief, you still have to move the houses. If you don't move, I'll detain you. And so I stayed in the detention center. Later, I don't know how, Political Commissar Li released me and told me: Don't be angry, vacate them. Then it was handled by Secretary Feng. The landlord's family said that I had broken an old jar that they had, so I had to pay for a new one. I also made up three dou of rent owed. The annual rent of one stone and three dou of rice was paid in full, without missing a single grain. My whole family of eight left Dong Chongxian on the fifteenth day of the twelfth month. As we were leaving, the landlord Ping Fugui and Village Chief Jiang Chengshui said that the sweet potatoes I had planted on the five mu of wasteland: the land belonged to their village, and the things also belonged to their village, and they wouldn't let me take them. I only took them after asking Deputy County Chief Zhou. My whole family left and stayed in Zejing Village, five li away from Dong Chongxian. The landlord Ping Fugui went to Zejing to sabotage, saying that I was a spy in his village and that they shouldn't keep me. The militia committee director of Zejing was a poor man, and he knew our difficulties, so he spoke a few harsh words and drove him away, and I was able to stay in Zejing.

    Now that the Land Law Outline has been promulgated, I want to speak out. These landlords and bad cadres must now be truly dealt with.

    (My official name is Fu Yingui, my nickname is Fu Xiaoyuan, and I live in Zejing Village, Huguan. I can't write myself, so I found a comrade, I said it, he wrote it for me, and he read it to me, and I heard that it was all correct. If there is any error, I am willing to have a face-to-face dialogue with these people.)

    我们起来闹翻身被坏干部打垮了
    傅小元
    农民们：
    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。
    大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写。要不就自己来报馆跑一趟。再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。编辑同志：
    我是河南林县人，我叫傅小元，在家被地主剥削、压制的没法立足，在日本进攻长治的那一年，全家八口人讨饭讨到山西壶关县东崇贤村。说了千万句好话，租了地主平富贵七间破房子，每年租米一石三，这是正价。在过年过节得买几斤肉打几斤酒送送礼，农忙时送几个工，这是额外报谢。房子找下了，全家仍没一分地，只好由父亲开一个小店，妇女纺织，我担小挑捎带开坡地糊口，坡地慢慢开到五亩。
    几年来共产党号召我们翻身，组织起来和地主斗争，但因为村里的主要干部是地主、流氓当任，紧紧的保护着地主，使我们每次运动都是失败，石板没有揭掉，反而压的更重了。王太顺的父亲在旧社会当村长，王太顺在新社会当政治主任，点点头、说句话，地动山摇。程申福当副村长，他在从前吸料面、大烟，赌钱，嫖女人是他的家常便饭。蒋成水在敌顽在时是三面村长，以后也当成我们的抗勤。这些人掌握着大权，说一句哪个群众不害怕？这些人不做工作，成天赌博、嫖女人，根本说不上领导我们翻身，并且每次运动，都让他们把我们镇压下去。
    四二年我们起来闹翻身，他们把我们穷人压下去，弄的我们别说减租，连话也不敢多说。四四年各地运动又开始了，干部不领导我们干，我们想斗争又不敢。可巧区上李政委和赵同志来工作，他便告诉我们，只要我们齐心干，干部不领导也能翻透身。区公所给我们做主，穷人们就都胆大了。这时候地主平富贵威吓我们，说他兄弟是共产党，用手又比了个八字，不叫我们斗争。我们没有害怕，还更坚决了。没饭吃的毕魁则、张丑则、郭东贵等以苦引苦，动员我们穷朋友，要向地主作斗争。正在这时候，李政委开会走了。地主和干部就乘机向我们反攻。这一夜冬学里人特别多，地主家的大大小小全都来到，站的很高，满脸发笑。我们看见情形不对，用口传穷人完全走到别的地方去讨论。哪知道干部早在门上派好四五个民兵站着岗，步枪上着剌刀，我们一个也出不去。怎么办泥？我们又二次口传，今天黑夜任何人不发表意见，要看事办事，大谅他也不能把我们几十个穷人全消灭掉。我们挤在一起，一言不发，瞪着眼看。政治主任等干部讲话了。第一句说我们要斗山西人。要本地人团结起来对付我们。第二句给我们戴上了特务帽子，说我们开的是特务会。就让民兵里的地主儿子将我和张丑则捆起来。共产党号召我们翻身，区干部亲自领导，现在我们变成了特务。大家忍不住的要起来拼掉他几个，可是又想到我们手无寸铁，人家有权有枪，只能忍着。只要李政委明天赶来，我们就有了办法。我和张丑则扣在冰冷的观音堂里，还要喂我们粪吃。幸亏往区上送信的人走的快，李政委来了一信，这才没把我们吊起。第二天天明，李政委和赵同志赶来。我们问赵同志是不是给我们做主到底。赵同志答复我们说：他要到别村去了，叫我们不要灰心，总有一天会翻透身。李政委还在这里。事情以后糟了，领导运动的大权又交给干部了。我们又变成了斗争对象。没地种没饭吃的郭车贵，以旧社会最低下的行道打鼓赚来几斗米，成了封建剥削，吃了一顿打，米和鼓也给弄走了。张丑则是佃户，三天被连打三次。一天一次打，我们受不了，我与张丑则商量：摆在眼前一条路，只有找咱的老根，去参加解放军。张丑则就丢下没饭吃的母亲参军走了。穷人们的翻身运动被这些恶霸、地主打垮了，恶霸吃的开了，王太顺由政治主任升成公安局里管理员，蒋成水由抗勤当了村长。
    到了四五年冬天，地主害怕我们再来斗争，和干部在区公所和区长谈好，赶我出村，要我腾开租住的七间房子。宋世洪区长（女）照地主的意见给我判决了。我心里不服气，到县里找见周副县长，写了一信，让年后再搬。一封信恼了宋区长，把眼一瞪，说道：找县长也得腾房子，不腾扣起来。就这样的住了看守所。后来不知怎样，李政委把我放出来，又告我说：不要生气啦，给他腾开吧。接着由冯书记处理。地主家放的一个破缸，说是我用坏的，赔了新缸一个。又补上了三斗欠租。每年一石三斗米的房租，出了个整整齐齐，一颗不欠。全家八口人，在腊月十五离开了东崇贤。临起身时，五亩坡地种的山药蛋，地主平富贵和村长蒋成水说：地是他村的，东西也是他村的，不让我拿。我又问了周副县长才取走。全家走到离东崇贤五里地的泽井村留下。地主平富贵又到泽井去破坏，说我在他村落的是特务，别留他。泽井的武委会主任是穷人，他知道我们的困难，才说了两句硬话，把他给顶走，我才在泽井住下。
    土地法大纲公布了，我又要说话。这些地主和坏干部这时候可要真正处理处理了。
    （我官名叫傅银贵，小名傅小元，家住壶关泽井村。我自己不会写，找了个同志，我说，他给我写，又给我念了，我听的全对。如有一点差错，我愿当面和这些人来对话。）
