Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Reports from various sources: Under the orders of its American master, the British Labour government is currently "acting as a firefighter to rescue the 'Marshall Plan'" (Pravda), actively engaged in the conspiracy to organize a "Western European bloc." It is reported that Britain and France are initiating the organization of a "Western European bloc" through negotiations with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, turning it into a part of the "Marshall Plan." Simultaneously, Bevin, in the foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons on the 22nd, made an even more blunt speech, declaring: "The time has come to strengthen Western Europe"; and revealing that British diplomatic envoys to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have been instructed to jointly propose to the three countries, along with the French envoys, the signing of an alliance treaty, attempting to make this treaty "an important core of Western Europe." Bevin, as usual, launched a massive attack on the Soviet Union, while flattering his American master to the extreme, saying: "I believe we should express admiration for the great heart of the American people, which is fully demonstrated in the European Recovery Program." It is understood that Bevin's speech was entirely instructed by U.S. imperialism. According to a French Press Agency report on the 23rd, shortly before Bevin delivered his speech, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett and British Ambassador to the U.S. Inverchapel met with Truman; and as soon as Bevin's speech was delivered, the U.S. State Department echoed it on the 23rd, saying: "The United States wholeheartedly approves of Bevin's proposal to consolidate Western Europe."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: The British imperialist conspiracy to organize a "Western European bloc," and Bevin's speech in the House of Commons, have angered world progressive public opinion. The Soviet Pravda published an article on the 25th, strongly denouncing Bevin's speech as "a dangerous plan to split Europe against the will of the people, instigated by Wall Street." Pravda's diplomatic observer, Isakov, revealed that the "Western European bloc" plan is a condition of the "Marshall Plan," with the United States attempting to use it to more easily rule Western Europe and include it in the U.S. network of military bases. However, Isakov stressed: "This plan is doomed to failure because it contradicts the vital interests of European countries." The Czechoslovak Communist Party's newspaper stated on the 26th: "Bevin's plan to organize Western European countries into a political and military bloc is an idea of the United States, and his speech is proof of a broad and prepared offensive by reactionary forces against world peace." The Italian newspaper Unità denounced Bevin as "a gendarme of U.S. imperialism in Europe," pointing out: "Bevin's 'Western European bloc' is an instrument of war, a threat to peaceful nations and democracy, and an intimidation and blackmail of Europe." The newspaper emphasized: "The Italian Communist Party will do everything to oppose any attempt to drag Italy into this mad gamble." The French newspaper Franc-Tireur, in analyzing the servile nature of the Western European bloc, pointed out: "This bloc has succumbed to the United States to an alarming degree." The Indonesian newspaper Pembebasan condemned: "We do not support Bevin's imperialist plan, and we will fight for freedom. Bevin and his friends will extract as much as possible from Indonesia, Burma, India, and Vietnam, but the people of these countries fighting for freedom will vigorously resist these aggressive plans." The Argentine newspaper "La Labor" in an editorial entitled "Attlee is Truman's Lackey," fiercely criticized "Attlee and Bevin's government for maintaining American policy, indicating that the British government has become a lackey of American imperialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Comprehensive report: The arrogant speech of Bevin, the U.S. running dog, conspiring to organize a "Western European bloc," continues to arouse unanimous condemnation from world progressive public opinion. The Yugoslav newspaper Borba published an article on the 27th, believing that "Bevin's speech is an attempt by the British right-wing Socialist Party to assist its master in organizing a bloc of countries under U.S. control to oppose democratic forces and enslave Western European countries, in exchange for some small rewards." The newspaper stressed: "Bevin's talk of organizing a 'Western European bloc' is clear evidence that the reactionaries fear the expansion of the democratic anti-imperialist camp." The newspaper concluded: "Democratic forces will not allow their countries to become colonies of Wall Street." Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Director Grosz issued a statement on the 26th, strongly denouncing "Bevin's speech as completely identical to Churchill's speech." He pointed out: "The 'Western European bloc' advocated by Bevin is not conducive to the cause of peace in Europe, nor is it conducive to the development and independence of Europe." Grosz continued: "We firmly reject all covert decisions related to Poland in the Marshall Plan." And said with confidence: "It is certain that progressive forces will be able to resist all attempts to rebuild Munich in Europe." The Czech newspaper "Rudé Právo" revealed that "Bevin's plan was prepared in the United States and agreed to by the United States." The Pakistani newspaper "Dawn" said: "Bevin's plan intends to strengthen Britain's position in Muslim countries, and the British-Iranian treaty is another step in this direction." The Indian newspaper "Statesman" angrily criticized that "the foreign policy implemented by Attlee and Bevin is completely consistent with the war-monger Churchill." Egyptian newspapers also unanimously opposed Bevin's speech on the 26th. Al Misri reported: "Bevin's speech revealed Britain's desire to establish a 'Western bloc' and organize so-called 'Near East regional defense' to enslave the people of the Near East." The newspaper emphasized: "The people of the Near East are fighting to defend complete freedom and independence, and there is already a very strong anti-British sentiment among them."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Baghdad dispatch: Due to strong opposition from the Iraqi people, Iraqi Regent Ira formally announced on the 21st that the twenty-year British-Iraqi alliance treaty signed by Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr and British Foreign Secretary Bevin in Portsmouth on the 15th was invalid. As early as the 6th of this month, all students in Baghdad held grand demonstrations and marches, shouting to abolish the traitorous treaty and demanding the dissolution of Parliament and new elections. Although repeatedly suppressed by the police, resulting in deaths and injuries and hundreds of people being arrested, they persisted in their struggle and gained increasing support from the people. Fearing the power of the people, Ira had no choice but to convene an emergency cabinet meeting and issue the above statement. This treaty was originally a continuation of the British-Iraqi alliance treaty signed in 1930 during the British mandate period. The Iraqi people have struggled arduously for more than ten years to abolish the old treaty, but the new treaty is almost exactly the same as the old one. Britain is still allowed to station troops in Iraq and continues to maintain absolute control over Iraqi troops, police, and even civil aviation through the newly established so-called "Joint Defense Board." Britain's privileges over Iraq's largest resource, the Mosul oil field, are also completely unharmed, thus arousing extreme anger among the Iraqi people.

    英奉美帝命令开始组织“西欧集团”
    世界进步舆论同声怒斥
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方讯：奉美国主人之命，英工党政府目前“充当了抢救‘马歇尔计划’的救火队”（真理报），积极从事组织“西欧集团”的阴谋活动。据传：英法正通过和比利时、荷兰、卢森堡三国的谈判，开始组织“西欧集团”，把它变成“马歇尔计划”之一部分。与此同时，贝文二十二日在英下院外交政策辩论中，更发表了直言不讳的演说，他宣称：“加强西欧的时间已经到来”；并泄露：英驻比、荷、卢三国外交使节，已奉命与法国使节一致发出和比、荷、卢三国谈判签订同盟条约的建议，并妄图使这一条约“成为西欧之重要核心”。贝文照例对苏联大肆攻击，对其美国主子则极尽其谄媚称：“我认为目前应向欧洲复原计划中充分表现出来的美国人民之伟大心肠，表示崇敬。”据悉，贝文之演说完全为美帝国主义所授意。据法新社二十三日电透露：在贝文发表演说前不久，美副国务卿罗维特和英驻美大使殷维却波尔，曾与杜鲁门会谈；而贝文演说刚才发表，美国务院二十三日即与其合唱称：“美国衷心赞成贝文巩固西欧的建议”。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合各方讯：英帝国主义组织“西欧集团”之阴谋活动，和贝文的下院演说，使世界进步舆论发怒。苏联真理报廿五日撰文力斥贝文演说“为违反民意企图分裂欧洲之危险计划，乃华尔街所授意。”真理报外交观察家伊萨科夫揭发称：“西欧集团”计划，是作为“马歇尔计划”的条件之一，美国企图借此更容易地统治西欧，并把它列入美国的作战基地网中。但伊氏力称：“这个计划由于它与欧洲国家的切身利益相矛盾，因此它注定了要失败的。”捷共机关报于二十六日指出：“贝文组织西欧各国成立政治军事集团的计划，是美国出的主意，他的演说是反动势力对世界和平进行广泛和有准备之攻势的证明。”意大利团结报怒斥贝文“为美帝国主义在欧洲的宪兵”，指出：“贝文的‘西欧集团’乃是战争的工具，是对和平民族及民主的威胁，对欧洲的恫吓讹诈。”该报强调：“贝文的立足点是不稳的，因为他威胁千百万人民的生命与欧洲的将来。”该报力称：“意共将全力反对使意大利卷入这一疯狂赌博的任何企图。”法国义勇军报在分析西欧集团的奴隶性时指出：“这个集团对美国已屈服到可惊的程度。”印尼解放报谴责称：“我们不支持贝文的帝国主义计划，我们将为争取自由而斗争。贝文及其友人们将尽可能向印尼、缅甸、印度与越南多索取东西，但这些国家为争取自由而战的人民，将给这些侵略计划以有力的反抗。”阿根廷“劳工报”在题为“艾德礼是杜鲁门的马弁”的社论中，猛烈抨击“艾德礼、贝文政府维护美国之政策，说明英国政府已变成美国帝国主义的马弁”。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合报导：美国走卒贝文阴谋组织“西欧集团”的狂妄演说，继续激起世界进步舆论的一致抨斥。南斯拉夫战斗报廿七日撰文，认为“贝文演说，是英国右翼社会党力图援助其主子，组织在美国控制下的国家集团，以反对民主势力与奴役西欧各国，借此换取一些小的报酬。”该报力称：贝文所说的组织“西欧集团”，“这就是反动派害怕民主反帝阵营扩大的明证”。该报结语力称：“民主势力将不容许他们的国家变成华尔街的殖民地”。波兰外交部新闻司长格罗兹二十六日发表声明，力斥“贝文演说和邱吉尔的演说完全相同”。他指出：“贝文所提倡的‘西欧集团’，不利于欧洲的和平事业，也不利于欧洲的发展与独立。”格氏继称：“我们坚决拒斥马歇尔计划中对波兰有关的一切暗中的决定”。并满怀信心说：“可以肯定进步势力将能抵抗一切重建慕尼黑欧洲的企图”。捷克“鲁德·布拉窝”报揭发“贝文的计划是在美国准备而且由美国同意的”。巴基斯坦“顿报”说：“贝文计划是打算加强英国在回教国家的地位，英伊条约正是朝着这个方向走的另一步骤。”印度“政治家”报怒责“艾德礼与贝文所执行的外交政策，是与战争贩子邱吉尔完全一致。”埃及各报二十六日也一致反对贝文演说，阿尔米斯里报称：“贝文演说透露了英国企图建立‘西方集团’，并组织所谓‘近东区域防御’的欲望，以奴役近东人民。”该报强调指出：“近东人民正为保卫完全的自由独立而斗争，他们之间已存在着极强烈的反英情绪”。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】巴格达讯：由于伊拉克人民强烈反对结果，伊拉克摄政王伊拉，于二十一日正式宣布伊总理雅布尔与英外相贝文十五日在朴资茅斯签订之英伊二十年同盟条约无效。早自本月六日起，巴格达全体学生即连续举行盛大示威游行，高呼取消卖国条约，并要求解散国会，重行大选。虽屡遭警察弹压，死伤多人，数百人并横遭拘捕，但仍坚持斗争，并获得日益广泛之人民支持。伊拉慑于人民威力，乃不得不召集内阁紧急会议后发表上述声明。按此约原为一九三○年英国委任统治期内所订英伊同盟条约之继续，伊拉克人民十余年来为废除旧约而艰苦斗争，然新约竟与旧约几乎完全相同，英国仍得驻军伊拉克，并得通过新设之所谓“联防局”而继续保有对伊拉克军队、警察甚至民用航空之绝对控制权，英国对伊拉克最大资源摩苏尔油田之特权，亦丝毫无损，因此激起伊人之极度愤慨。
