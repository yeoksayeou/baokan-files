Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th - The spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Headquarters, commenting on the incident of five U.S. Marines participating in the civil war in Wang Lintao, north of Jimo, Shandong, on December 25th of last year, stated: The U.S. Navy Department's attempt to explain that the actions of these five American soldiers did not constitute participation in the Chinese civil war is futile. These five U.S. Marines were fighting the People's Liberation Army more than 100 li away from Qingdao, and at that time, the area was on the front line. At that time, eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were attacking and besieging the People's Liberation Army in Laiyang, amidst the cheers and urgent expectations of the American reactionaries. The spokesperson pointed out: The presence of American armed forces and military personnel on Chinese territory is an insult and violation of China's independence. Except for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who are willingly serving as running dogs of American imperialism, no Chinese person does not resolutely oppose this insult and violation. It is a well-known fact that American armed forces and military personnel are running rampant across China and helping Chiang Kai-shek conduct a civil war. This is entirely an act of imperialist aggression, and the great Chinese nation will never tolerate such aggression.

The spokesperson pointed out: Since October 1945, American armed forces and military personnel have continuously carried out intrusions and military reconnaissance into the Liberated Areas and put forward unreasonable demands. Important examples include: On October 4, 1945, a U.S. destroyer suddenly arrived in Yantai in the Liberated Area, and a colonel officer landed, demanding that the People's Liberation Army immediately withdraw from Yantai and hand over the Yantai municipal government to the U.S. military for takeover, which was sternly rejected by our side. From October 11 to December 1945, the U.S. military occupied Qinhuangdao and used it as a bridgehead for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops to attack Shanhaiguan and the Northeast Liberated Area. The U.S. military acted as the vanguard for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in attacking Shanhaiguan. In June and July 1946, the U.S. military replaced Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in guarding the Beining Railway and continuously intruded into our Jidong Liberated Area. On July 29, 1946, the famous Anping Incident occurred, in which a U.S. military patrol, in coordination with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, invaded the Anping Liberated Area in Xianghe County, Hebei Province. On March 1, 1947, U.S. military officers Rege and Collins, together with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, invaded our Northeast Democratic Allied Army near Changchun. They were captured by our army and confessed to conducting military reconnaissance, and were released by our army on April 24. On August 27, 1947, two U.S. fighter planes intruded into Langnuankou Xiaolidao, Muping County, in the Jiaodong Liberated Area. One of them was forced to land, and its pilot, Lieutenant Winters, was rescued from danger by our military and civilians. The next day, nine U.S. planes and seven U.S. ships came to the area, and U.S. soldiers on board landed without permission, injuring three villagers and destroying doors, windows, and other objects. After negotiations, U.S. Navy Commander Kirk and Commander of the Seventh Fleet issued written apologies and compensated for the losses, and our army released Winters. All these past facts prove how the American armed forces and military personnel stationed in China are everywhere hostile to the People's Liberation Army, and how the People's Liberation Army has treated them with great leniency. In the Wang Lintao incident in Jimo, Shandong, the People's Liberation Army took completely legitimate measures, and all responsibility should be borne by the U.S. military. In order to avoid the recurrence of such incidents, American military forces and military personnel should stop helping Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang conduct a civil war against the Chinese people, and should immediately withdraw from China.

    人民解放军总部发言人评王麟陶事件
    美军参加内战破坏我主权
    应停止助蒋并即退出中国
    【新华社陕北十三日电】人民解放军总部发言人，评去年十二月二十五日美海军陆战队五人，在山东即墨以北王麟陶参加内战之事件称：美国海军部曾企图解释此五名美国士兵之行动，不是参加中国内战，那是徒然的。这五名美国海军陆战队士兵，是在离开青岛一百华里以外的地方，与人民解放军作战，而且当时该地正在火线上，当时蒋介石匪帮的军队八个旅，正在美国反动派的欢呼与迫切期望中，进攻包围莱阳的人民解放军。发言人指出：美国武装力量与军事人员留驻中国领土，是对中国独立的侮辱和侵犯，除了甘心情愿当美国帝国主义走狗的蒋介石匪帮以外，凡是中国人没有不坚决反对这种侮辱和侵犯的。美国的武装力量和军事人员，在中国各地横行无忌，并帮助蒋介石进行内战，这是人所共知的事实，这完完全全是帝国主义的侵略行为，伟大的中华民族，决不能忍受此种侵略。发言人指出：从一九四五年十月以来，美国武装力量与军事人员，不断向解放区实行侵犯与军事侦察，并提出无理要求。其中重要的如：一九四五年十月四日，美国驱逐舰一艘，突然到达解放区的烟台，并有一上校军官登陆，要求人民解放军立即撤离烟台，并将烟台市政府交给美军接管，当被我方严词拒绝。一九四五年十月十一日至十二月，美军占领秦皇岛，并以该地充当蒋介石匪军进攻山海关与东北解放区的桥头堡垒，美军充当蒋介石匪军的向山海关进攻的带路先锋。一九四六年六、七两月，美军代替蒋介石匪军守备北宁铁路，并向我冀东解放区不断侵犯。一九四六年七月二十九日，爆发著名的安平事件，美军巡逻队配合蒋介石匪军，侵犯河北省香河县之安平解放区。一九四七年三月一日美军军官芮格及柯林士二人，在长春附近与蒋介石匪军一同侵犯我东北民主联军，被我军俘获，供认系进行军事侦察，四月二十四日由我军释放。一九四七年八月二十七日，美战斗机两架侵入胶东解放区牟平县浪暖口小里岛，其中一架被迫降落，其驾驶员尉官文特斯被我军民拯救出险。次日美机九架，美舰七艘前来该地，舰上美兵擅自登陆，打伤村民三人，打毁门窗物件，经交涉后，由美海军司令柯克及七十一舰队司令书面道歉与赔偿损失后，我军将文特斯释放。这种种以往的事实，都证明了美国驻华的武装力量与军事人员，如何处处与人民解放军为敌，而人民解放军又如何宽大的对待他们。此次山东即墨王麟陶事件，人民解放军采取了完全正当的措施，一切责任应由美军负责，为了避免这种事件的再度发生，美国军事力量及军事人员，应停止帮助蒋介石匪帮进行反对中国人民的内战，并应当立即退出中国去。
