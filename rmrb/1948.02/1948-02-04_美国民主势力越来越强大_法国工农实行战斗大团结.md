    American Democratic Forces Grow Stronger; French Workers and Peasants Achieve Militant Unity
    In the past week, the American people have launched a movement against US imperialist aggression in the Far East, namely the "National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East" held in New York. This conference was initiated by the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, with participants including representatives from 107 American organizations. The conference strongly condemned the US imperialist policy of aggression and expansion in the Far East, especially the policy of helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang carry out a civil war and massacre the Chinese people. It also passed important resolutions demanding action to stop the transportation of weapons, ammunition, and other aid to the Chiang bandits and the Dutch and French aggressors in Indonesia and Vietnam. This righteous call has been enthusiastically echoed by the American working class. The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, and others are prepared to begin boycotting the US government's shipments of aid to Chiang. Progressive leaders of several CIO, AFL, and independent unions have loudly proclaimed: "Stop the shipment of arms to China (Chiang) and other countries," "Support any action that deprives the makers of China's reactionary war of weapons." This action by the progressive people of America demonstrates the close unity of the international democratic anti-imperialist camp. This not only strikes at the reactionary American government and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, but also encourages the Chinese people and the oppressed nations of the Far East who are fighting for liberation. At the same time, a movement resisting the anti-communist and anti-democratic actions of the American reactionaries is also rising within the United States. American workers and democratic groups are preparing to launch a magnificent movement to protest the US authorities' heinous anti-communist and anti-democratic policies. All of this confirms what Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, pointed out: "Within the United States, there exists a growing force of people's democracy."
    In France and Italy, the people's movements continue to surge. The wave of French people resisting the reactionary authorities' betrayal of the country and harming the people has "spread rapidly throughout France" (TASS). Angry mass rallies are being held everywhere from Dunkirk to the Seine province. Workers, peasants, small and medium-sized merchants, and professionals have all joined this struggle. The National Congress of Peasants' Representatives, initiated by the French Communist Party, has opened grandly in Paris. In the letter to the French peasants published by the Congress of Representatives, it was emphasized that "only the French Communist Party is the firm defender of the interests of the French peasants." Therefore, they "approved the program proposed by the Communist Party, that is, to struggle to improve the lives of French peasants and to establish a truly democratic people's government." The convocation of the National Congress of Peasants' Representatives shows that the French working class has achieved militant unity with the French peasants, and they are prepared to fight shoulder to shoulder to realize a new democratic France. In Italy, to answer the police's atrocities against unemployed workers who were demonstrating, the province and city of Florence and its nearby forty-nine towns held a victorious general strike. Demonstrations and strikes have occurred everywhere in Milan, Turin, Airona, Pisa, Livorno, Naples, Turin, and other places. At the same time, the Italian people are also rising up to protest the US imperialist infringement on Italian sovereignty and seizure of Italian military bases. This "has given the rising wave of strikes and demonstrations a national dimension." (TASS)
    The greater strength of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries is also encouraging the world democratic movement. The summary of last year's production published by the Soviet State Planning Commission shows that industrial production not only completed the plan, but also made up for the previous year's deficit, and agricultural production has completely recovered to pre-war levels, increasing by 32 percent compared to the previous year. South, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries have also basically completed last year's economic plans. Hungary and Romania signed a twenty-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance last week. Recently, the Soviet Union and Poland also concluded two economic agreements stipulating that they will vigorously help Poland develop its economy under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. These all point out the correct path for the European people to seek foreign aid to revive their countries in accordance with the spirit of equality, friendship, and mutual benefit. And the separate conclusion of trade agreements between Belgium and Luxembourg and the Soviet Union is tantamount to a slap in the face to the so-called Marshall Plan that enslaves Western Europe.
    In the past week, US imperialism once again issued an order to its servant, the Labor government, to have Britain "act as the firefighter to save the Marshall Plan," fearing that this paper house of the "Marshall Plan" would be burned down by the world's people's growing anger of resistance. Therefore, Bevin hurriedly came out to rehash Churchill's old tune of a "Western European Group," and also conspired to organize the so-called "Middle East Group" to save and supplement the "Marshall Plan" which is "heading for collapse" (Pravda). But as soon as Bevin's two magic weapons were offered, they were immediately met with resistance from the powerful forces of the people, and first suffered defeat in the Middle East. The "Anglo-Iraqi Alliance Treaty," as the first step of the "Middle East Group," was declared abolished under the strong opposition of the Iraqi people. The anti-British demonstration of 100,000 residents in Baghdad, the anti-British demonstration of Egyptian students, the "severance of diplomatic relations with Britain" demonstration in Damascus, Syria, etc., frightened British imperialism, and it had to temporarily shelve its attempt to organize the "Middle East Group" and postpone the signing of "alliance treaties" with various Arab countries. This incident shows that the power of the people can curb reactionary conspiracies, and it also shows that the conspiracy of US and British imperialism to organize a "Western European Group" to suppress the European democratic and anti-imperialist movement must eventually fail.

    美国民主势力越来越强大  法国工农实行战斗大团结
    过去一周中，美国人民已开展反对美帝国主义侵略远东的运动，这就是在纽约召开的“美国对华及远东政策全国会议”。这个会议由远东民主政策委员会发起，与会者包括美国一百零七个团体的代表。会议严词抨责美帝国主义在远东的侵略扩张政策，特别是帮助蒋介石匪帮进行内战屠杀中国人民的政策，并通过了重要的决议，要求采取行动以停止运输武器、军火及其他援助给蒋匪与印尼、越南的荷法侵略者。这一正义号召，已得到美国工人阶级的热烈响应。国际码头工人及仓库工人协会，美国海运厨夫膳务员工会等，已准备开始抵制美政府运送援蒋物资。若干产联、劳联所属工会及独立工会的进步领袖，大声疾呼：“阻止对中国（蒋）及其他国家的军火船运”，“支持剥夺中国反动战争制造者之武器的任何行动”。美国进步人民的这一行动，表现了国际民主反帝阵营的亲密团结，这不但打击了反动的美国政府与蒋家匪帮，而且给予为争取解放而斗争的中国人民和远东各被压迫民族以鼓励。与此同时，一个反抗美国反动派反共反民主的运动，也正在美国内兴起。美国职工与民主团体正筹备发起一个雄伟的运动，抗议美国当局的反共反民主的罪恶政策。这一切证实了中国人民领袖毛主席所指出的：“美国内部，存在着日趋强大的人民民主势力”。
    在法意两国，人民运动继续高涨。法国人民抗拒反动当局卖国害民的浪潮，已“迅速蔓延全法”（塔斯社）。从敦刻尔克到塞纳省，到处召开愤怒的群众大会。工人、农民、中小商人和自由职业者都卷进了这个斗争。由法共发起的全国农民代表会议，已在巴黎隆重揭幕。在代表会议所发表的告法国农民书中，强调指出：“只有法国共产党，是法国农民利益的坚决保卫者”。因而“批准了共产党建议的纲领，即为改善法国农民生活及成立真正民主的人民政府而奋斗”。全法国农民代表会议的召开，昭示着法国工人阶级已与法国农民实行了战斗大团结，他们已准备肩并肩地为实现新民主的法兰西而斗争了。意大利劳动人民为回答警察对示威的失业工人的暴行，佛罗伦萨省市及其附近的四十九个城镇，曾举行了胜利的总罢工。米兰、都尔、艾隆纳、比萨、里窝那、那不勒斯、都灵等地，到处都发生了示威和罢工。同时，意大利人民对于美帝国主义侵犯意国主权和攫取意大利军事基地的暴举，亦奋起抗议。顿使“罢工与示威浪潮之高涨，又具有全国性的规模”。（塔斯社）
    苏联及新民主国家的更加强大，亦鼓舞着世界民主运动。苏联国家计划委员会所发表的去年生产总结，说明工业生产不仅完成了计划，而且补足了前年的差额，农业生产则已完全恢复了战前水平，且较前年增加百分之三十二。南、波、捷、匈、保等国，亦已基本上完成了去年的经济计划。匈牙利与罗马尼亚在上周已签订了二十年友好合作互助条约。最近苏联与波兰又订立了两项经济协定，规定在平等互惠的原则下，大力帮助波兰发展经济。这些都给欧洲人民指示了一条依照平等友好互惠精神，寻求外援以复兴国家的正确道路。而比利时及卢森堡与苏联的分别缔结贸易协定，对于奴役西欧的所谓马歇尔计划，不啻打了一记耳光。
    过去一周，美帝国主义又给他的奴仆工党政府发出了一道命令，要英国“充当拯救马歇尔计划的救火队”，害怕这座“马歇尔计划”的纸屋子，会被世界人民日益增长的反抗的怒火所烧掉。于是贝文即急急忙忙出来重弹邱吉尔的“西欧集团”的老调，且阴谋组织所谓“中东集团”，以挽救和补充“走向崩溃”的“马歇尔计划”（真理报）。但是当贝文这两件法宝刚一祭起，立即遭受人民强大力量的抗击，并首先在中东遭到了失败。作为“中东集团”第一步的“英伊同盟条约”，已在伊拉克人民强烈的反对下宣告废除。巴格达十万居民的反英大示威，埃及学生的示威抗英，叙利亚大马士革的“对英绝交”示威游行等等，吓得英帝国主义手忙脚乱，不得不暂时搁置其组织“中东集团”的企图，延缓其与各阿拉伯国家签订“同盟条约”。这件事说明了人民力量是可以遏止反动阴谋的，也就说明了美英帝国主义妄图组织“西欧集团”以镇压欧洲民主反帝运动的阴谋，最后一定要破灭。              （新华社）
