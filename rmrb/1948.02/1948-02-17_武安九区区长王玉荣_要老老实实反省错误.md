Peasants:

    Our newspaper welcomes everyone to come here and denounce the crimes of the landlords, expose shortcomings in our work, promote the good and appropriate things that we peasants believe in, and put forward our own demands and suggestions for improving our work. All institutions, organizations, and individuals mentioned by everyone must express their attitude. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to everyone's opinions should accept and implement them. If there are any inaccuracies, explanations can be made, and differing opinions can be presented. Those who can write should write themselves. Those who cannot write can ask the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write, or they can personally come to the newspaper office. If that's not possible, write a letter to the newspaper and let us know, and we can figure out a way.

    The current chief of the Ninth District of Wu'an, Wang Yurong, is a big stone weighing down the peasants. Wang Qingyun and other poor peasants from Nanxi Village accuse him of exploiting the peasants.

    Wang Yurong is from Nanxi Village, Wu'an. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the first director of the farmers' association in Xijing (before Nanxi and Beixi Villages were separated). Later, he served as a town chief and district cadre. He "compromised" twice (returned home to be an ordinary peasant). According to Wang Jufu, who worked as a hired laborer for his third uncle, his grandfather, Wang Jiuyang, farmed sixty mu of land and had a mule, a donkey, and two oxen. He hired a long-term laborer and also raised a large flock of sheep. In the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1923 or 1924), the family divided into three branches. Wang Yurong's second uncle and third uncle (named Wang Tongchang, who was struggled against in 1946) both hired long-term laborers. Wang Yurong's father, Wang Qiu Zi, relied on his own labor because he had more manpower. According to labor hero Zhang Jiajun, "Later, his second uncle's opium addiction ruined him, and he sold seven mu of land to Wang Yurong's father." In the thirteenth or fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Wang Yurong and his four brothers divided the family property, each receiving seven mu of land (according to Zhang Jiajun). Hao Guitian, the deputy village chief of Nanxi Village, said about Wang Yurong's distribution of fruit last year, "According to his status, he shouldn't have been entitled to a share because he's a worker's family member. But he got a lot. The first distribution was 9,000 yuan per share, so three shares were 27,000 yuan. The second time, it was 1,500 yuan per share, and he also got three shares. The highest share in the village was only ten shares." According to poor peasant Wang Gongliang, "Wang Yurong currently has ten mu of land (including six mu of good land, with a total output of over ten shi, enough for three people to eat), divided into five plots, each cultivated by two or three families. The village treats his family the same as families of revolutionary martyrs, assigning labor for planting, gathering firewood, carrying water, milling rice, transporting coal, etc."

    Regarding Wang Yurong's time as town chief, political director Hu Tingxuan said: At that time, most people didn't dare to gamble, but as long as he was involved, they could gamble. He collected 500 yuan as a "head fee" for each "treasure" game. He took one-tenth of the "banmian" (a type of gambling). At that time, rice cost five mao per jin, so he earned 1,000 jin of rice per "treasure" game. During his time as town chief, he became very close to the landlords. Landlords gave him gifts and treated him to meals. Because the accounts were unclear, the masses wanted to oppose his corruption, so he feigned illness and returned home to be an ordinary peasant. This was his first "compromise." Later, he was transferred back to work in the district.

    In 1944, he was a district cadre in the Second District. Whether it was due to poor food or other reasons, he feigned illness and returned home. After returning, he often sought medical treatment from doctor Hu Zezhi (a landlord). He told Hu Zezhi, "When the cadres ask me, just say I'm sick!" In fact, he wasn't sick. The county government, unaware of the details, gave him an unknown amount of grain for his illness. He already had grain stored himself. At that time, the famine hadn't passed, and people had no food to eat, so he took the opportunity to start lending at high interest rates. According to Hu Tingxuan, he was the only person in the village lending money, with interest rates as high as 30% per month and as low as 12.5% per month. He lent money in two ways: one was lending cash. Because the peasants are still afraid of him, they dare not admit that they borrowed money from him, so all his materials have not yet been gathered. According to preliminary statistics, he lent 5,900 yuan to just five debtors (all poor peasants): Wang Cunshan, Wang Daheng, Wang Zhenqing, Guo Yuqing, and Wang Dingyi. Except for Guo Yuqing's 600 yuan, which was at an interest rate of 12.5% per month, the others were all at an interest rate of 1,000 yuan, with a daily interest of 100 yuan, equivalent to 30% per month. The other way was "buying licenses." Before the wheat and autumn harvests, when there was a shortage of food, he would lend wheat or millet to the peasants. After the wheat and autumn harvests, in less than two months, they would have to pay back double. This was called "buying licenses." Six poor peasants, Guo Yuqing, Gao Changfu, Wang Qingyun, Wang Dingguo, Wang Cunling, and Wang Kuiyou, borrowed 175 jin of rice and wheat from him, plus 15 jin of millet (partial materials).

    That year, when the masses were mobilized, they couldn't hold back their anger and demanded the clearing of Wang Yurong's accounts. At that time, Wang Yurong and a standing committee member of the farmers' association were in a mutual aid team together, and they were very close. The farmers' association arranged to struggle against Wang Yurong, and this standing committee member tipped Wang Yurong off. Wang Yurong, seeing that the situation was not good, infiltrated the farmers' association, pulled in some of the masses, and made the masses and cadres afraid to express their opinions. He thus sabotaged the peasants' attempt to clear his accounts. As a result, some secretly repaid the principal and interest, while others only repaid the principal and not the interest. Wang Yurong was not convinced. He also collected the opinions of landlords who had already had their rent and interest reduced, attempting to attack the cadres, but he did not succeed. According to Shen Guilin (from Beixi Village), deputy director of the Wu'an Military Committee in the Sixth District, last autumn, he and Liu Degui, the district chief of the Sixth District, visited Wang Yurong's house. Afterward, they casually commented that Wang Yurong's house was nicely decorated. The masses said, "He earned the money from lending!" They had also heard that the interest rates were high, but they didn't ask about it, and of course, they didn't deal with it.

    According to labor hero Zhang Jiajun, Wang Yurong not only lent money at high interest rates but also bought green crops at low prices during famine years, for which he was criticized by the government. The situation was this: That year, during the famine, the poor households of the Wang family jointly opened up a large graveyard and planted green crops. However, they were too hungry, so Wang Yurong took the opportunity to buy the green crops at a low price (reportedly for only 300 yuan). The county government felt that Wang Yurong was a cadre and that it was too harsh of him to do this, so they ordered him to give the grain from the green crops to the poor households. It is unknown whether he did so.

    Guo Yinhe, a refugee, also mentioned that in the famine year, Wang Yurong also bought more than two mu of land from his uncle Guo Qiyin at a low price. Because of the poor harvest, the poor peasants ate the grain from the farmers' association (this was relief grain transported by the government from Shanxi, which was given to grain transporters by the farmers' association to keep and eat). They had no way to repay it all, so they had to sell the land to Wang Yurong.

    Wang Yurong not only lent money at high interest rates, exploited the peasants, and sabotaged the peasants' attempts to clear his accounts but also helped the landlords retaliate against the peasants. According to political director Hu Tingxuan, in 1944, during the rent reduction and debt clearing campaign, Nanxi Village struggled against the big landlord Hu Qitang. (According to Song Zhanlin, who was once the chairman of the Wu'an County Farmers' Association, Hu Qitang once returned 270 shi of rent, making him the largest landlord in Xijing.) Hu Qitang's third son was Wang Yurong's godson. When Wang Yurong returned to the village, Hu Qitang said to him, "I wasn't harmed when you were working in the village. As soon as you left, there was rent reduction and debt clearing, and I was defeated. Wang Juwen made too many criticisms." Upon hearing this, Wang Yurong found Ji Hong, the chairman of the district salvation association residing in the village, and Wang Wuxiang, a district cadre, and said, "Wang Juwen is not a good person. He hates the landlord, but he shouldn't have asked the masses for money to marry his wife." Wang Juwen was a poor peasant. He married a widow and needed to spend more than twenty yuan to buy clothes, but he couldn't afford it. Ten village cadres, sympathizing with his difficulties, each helped him with five yuan. This was the truth about Wang Yurong's claim that Wang Juwen asked the masses for money to marry his wife. Ji Hong, unaware of the details, fell for Wang Yurong's trick. As a result, Wang Juwen was struggled against. Wang Yurong personally controlled the meeting, preventing village cadres from participating, and put a "corruption" label on Wang Juwen and detained him. Later, the village cadres released him.

    After Wang Yurong "compromised" for the second time and returned home, he did so many bad things. After he was transferred to work in Wudong County, according to Zhang Jiajun, he even asked the landlord Hu Yunting to lend money at high interest rates on his behalf. That year, the government sent people to investigate and discovered that the landlord Hu Yunting was lending at high interest rates, and the capital came from Wang Yurong. At a mass meeting in Nanxi Village, Li Fuchang, a section chief from the county government, scolded Hu Yunting, saying, "Your friend (referring to Wang Yurong) is not worth a fart!" At that time, the government only criticized Wang Yurong and did not dismiss him from his position. He continued to serve as a cadre and rule the masses, and the honest peasants dared not say a word.

    According to poor peasant Wang Qingyun, in the first lunar month of 1945, Wang Yurong bought manure from his family (two yuan per load) and asked Wang Yuqing to carry it. Wang Yuqing found three small lambs in the manure and told him about it. Wang Yurong said, "Just say there were ten lambs." Then, Wang Yurong spread the word on the street that Wang Qingyun's father, Wang Yincheng (nicknamed Lao Chuzi), had slaughtered more than ten ewes, and reported it to the county government's judicial office, which was stationed in Jianshan Village at the time. On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, Wang Yincheng was arrested and detained for ten days. He was fined 12,000 yuan (at that time, a sheep cost 50 yuan). Wang Yincheng returned home on the twenty-fourth day of the first lunar month, and, frightened and angered, he fell ill on the twenty-fifth day and died on the first day of the second lunar month. Wang Yurong carried twelve more loads of manure, and when Wang Qingyun went to ask for payment, he refused to pay.

    According to Hu Tingxuan, in the spring of 1946, the house of the landlord Wang Shijie was confiscated. Wang Yueyou (a new middle peasant), a refugee who had returned from Anze, wanted to buy it, and Hao Guitian, the deputy village chief, also wanted to buy it. Wang Yurong's wife sent a message to Wang Yurong (who was working in Longwu Village, more than ten li away), and Wang Yurong said that he wanted to buy the house. As a result, no one dared to buy it, and Wang Yurong bought it. Where did the money come from? According to Song Zhanlin (from Longwu Village, currently recovering at home), who was once the chairman of the Wu'an County Farmers' Association, the money came from Wang Yurong's share of the fruits of struggle in Longwu Village. He said: During the movement in the spring of 1946, Wang Yurong was working in Longwu and bought some tables, cabinets, and other items. It is unknown whether he paid for them. During the second distribution of the fruits of struggle, Wang Yurong also allocated two shares for himself (10,000 yuan per share). Li Jingnan, another district cadre working in Longwu, disagreed, but it didn't have any effect. When announcing the share distribution at the farmers' association meeting, he didn't announce Wang Yurong's name. As a result, he took 20,000 yuan from the village chief, Ren Mingxing. Later, during the collective self-criticism of the village cadres, the village chief initially denied it, but after everyone pressed him, he admitted it.

    武安九区区长王玉荣
    要老老实实反省错误
    贫农王清云等谈  薛风代笔
    农民们：
    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。
    现任武安九区区长王玉荣，是压制农民的一块大石板。南西井贫农王清云等控诉他对农民的压榨罪行。
    玉王荣是武安南西井人。抗战初期任西井（南北西井还没分开）第一任农会主任，后来当过镇长、区干部。中间“妥协”两次（回家当老百姓）。据给他三叔当长工的王巨富说，他祖父叫王九阳，种六十亩地，有一条骡子、一个驴、两个牛，觅着一个长工，还喂着大群羊。民国十二、三年三股分家，王玉荣的二叔和三步（叫王同昌，三十五年被斗），都觅着长工，王玉荣父亲王秋子这一股，因为劳力多，自种自吃。听劳动英雄张家俊说：“后来他二叔吸料面把时光弄垮，有七亩地卖给王玉荣父亲。”民国十三、四年，王玉荣弟兄四人分家，每人分地七亩。（张家俊说的）南西井副村长郝贵田谈去年王玉荣分果实的情况说：“按他的成份，就该不着分，因为是个工属哩，也就分的不少。头一次三分，每分九千元，三九两万七。第二次每分一千五百元，也分了三分。村里最高的分才十分。”据贫农王功亮说：“王玉荣现有十来亩地（内有六亩好地，共合产量十石挂零，共三口人吃）共分五片，每片二、三家代耕。村上对他家和抗烈属一样忧待：种地、打柴、担水、碾米、驮炭等完全派差派工。”
    谈到王玉荣当镇长的情况，政治主任胡廷选说：那时一般人已不敢赌博，可是只要他搭上股就能赌。出一场“宝”，他收五百元的“头钱”。“板面”（赌博的一种形式），他见十抽一。当时米价是五毛一斤，一场“宝”他就赚一千斤米。他在当镇长的过程中，和地主拉得很紧，地主给他送礼，请他的客。因为帐目不清，群众要反他的贪污，他装病回家当了老百姓。这是第一次“妥协”，后来又调到区上工作。
    民国三十三年，他在老二区当区干部，不知因为吃的不好还是别的原因，他装病回来了。回来以后，常找医生胡泽志（地主）看“病”。他对胡泽志说：“干部问我的时候，就说我有病哩！”其实没病。县政府不摸底细，还给了他不知多少养病粮。他自己本来就有存粮，那时灾荒还没过去，都没粮食吃，他就乘机放起高利贷来了。据胡廷选说：这是全村唯一放帐的人，利钱多的是月利三十分，少的是月利十二分五厘。他放帐有两种形式：一种是放钱。由于农民到现在还怕他，不敢承认借过他的债，所以他的全部材料还没弄出来，据初步统计，光王存山、王大恒、王振清、郭玉庆、王定一五个债户（都是贫农），就使了他五千九百元，除了郭玉庆使的六百元，是月利十二分五以外，别的都是使一千元，每天给利钱一百元，合月利三十分。另一种是“买牌”。麦前秋前，青黄不接的时候，他放给农民麦子或小米。麦后秋后，使不到两个月，就加倍还。这叫“买牌”。贫农郭玉庆、高长富、王清云、王定国、王存岭、王魁有六人，使了他一百七十五斤米、麦、另有十五斤谷子。（部分材料）
    那年发动群众，群众蹩不住劲，要求清算王玉荣的帐。那时，王玉荣和一个农会常委在一个互助组里，两个人很好。农会布置斗争王玉荣，这个农会常委给王玉荣透了气。王玉荣见势不妙，打进农会，拉了一部分群众，弄得群众、干部都不敢提意见了。他就破坏了农民这次对他的清算。结果，有的暗暗的还了他的本利，有的只还了本，没还利。王玉荣不服气，他还收集已被减过租息的地主们对干部的意见，企图打击干部，没有成功。据六区武委会副主任申桂林（北西井人）说：去年秋天他和六区区长刘德贵，到王玉荣家玩了玩，出来以后，闲谈王玉荣家里布置得不错。群众说：“人家放帐挣下钱啦！”他们也听说利钱不小，但没打听，当然也没处理。
    据劳动英雄张家俊谈：王玉荣不仅放高利货，还在灾荒年贱买青苗地，为这曾经受到政府批评。事情是这样的：那年灾荒，王家穷户伙开了块大坟地，种上青苗；可是肚里饿的不行，王玉荣就乘机把这块青苗地贱价买下了（据说只花了三百元钱）。县政府觉得王玉荣是干部，办这事太苛薄人，叫他把青苗地的粮食包出来，也不知包出来了没有？
    逃荒户郭银和也提起王玉荣灾荒那年，曾经贱买叔父郭起银家的二亩多地。因为过歉年，贫苦农民吃了农会的粮食（这是政府从山西运来的救济粮，由农会交给运粮户保管吃掉了的），没法全部归还，只好把地卖给了王玉荣。
    王玉荣不仅放高利贷，剥削农民，破坏了农民对他的清算，而且帮助地主向农民报复。据政治主任胡廷选说，民国三十三年清债减租，南西井斗争了大地主胡启堂。（据曾任武安县农会主席的宋占林说，胡启堂曾一次退租二百七十石，是西井的最大地主。）胡启堂的三儿子，是王玉荣的干儿子。王玉荣回到村里，胡启堂对他说：“你在村里担任工作的时候，我没被害。你一走，又减租、又清债，把我斗垮了。王聚文提意见太多。”王玉荣听了，找到住村干部区救联会主席纪红，区干事王五相说：“王聚文不是好人。对地主仇恨对，可是他说老婆，不该叫群众拿钱。”王聚文是贫农，说了个寡妇，要花二十多块钱买衣服，他花不起，有十个村干部体谅他的困难，每人帮了他五块钱。这就是王玉荣所说王聚文叫群众拿钱娶老婆的真相。纪红不摸底细，上了王玉荣的当。结果把王聚文斗了一顿。会场是王玉荣亲自掌握的，不让村干部参加，给王聚文戴上了个“贪污”的帽子，扣了起来。后来才叫村干部放出来。
    王玉荣二次“妥协”回家，办了这么些坏事情，等他调到武（安）东县工作以后，据张家俊说，他还又托地主胡运廷替他代放高利贷。那年政府派人来调查，发现地主胡运廷放大利，本钱是由王玉荣手里拿出来的。在南西井群众会上，县政府李复昌科长，曾经训了胡运廷一顿，说你们的朋友（指王玉荣）不顶个屁！当时政府只批评了王玉荣一下，没有撒他的职，还让他当干部，继续统治群众，老实农民不敢吭气。
    据贫农王清云说，民国三十四年阴历正月，王玉荣在家买了他家的大粪（每担两元），叫王玉庆去挑，挑出三个小羊羔来，王玉庆告诉了他，他说：“你就说是十个羊羔子。”接着王玉荣在街上放出一股子气去，说王清云父亲王银成（外号老粗子）杀了十多个生产羊，报告了当时住在尖山村的县府承审处。正月十四日，把王银成扣起来，扣了十天。罚了一万二千块钱（当时五十块钱一只羊）。王银成正月二十四日回家，连吓加气，二十五日就得了病，二月初一日死了。王玉荣多担了十二担大粪，王清云去要，他不给钱。
    据胡廷选说，三十五年春天，地主王世杰的房子斗出来了，从安泽回来的逃荒户王月友（新中农）要买，副村长郝贵田也要买，王玉荣老婆给王玉荣捎了个信，王玉荣（当时在龙雾村工作，离家十多里）就说他要买这个房子。这一来谁也不敢要了，结果王玉荣买下。钱是那里来的呢？据曾任武安县农会主席的宋占林（龙雾村人，现在在家养病）说，钱是王玉荣在龙雾村分果实得的。他说：三十五年春天运动的时候，王玉荣在龙雾工作，买了些桌柜等物，不知给钱没有。第二次批果实，王玉荣也定了两分（一分一万元）。在龙雾工作的另一区干部李敬南不同意，但是没有起什么作用，只是在农会上宣布分数的时候，没有宣布王玉荣的名字，结果他从村长任明兴那里拿走了两万块钱。以后村干部集体反省当中，开头村长不承认，后来大家一挤，他才说出来。
