Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Reports from various sources: The economic volatility in the United States has begun to affect major economic centers in the capitalist world. The London stock market "has seen a new wave of selling" (TASS, 12th), with stock values falling by millions of pounds. Industrial stocks, especially oil stocks, have fallen the most. The value of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's common stock has fallen by 27.5 million pounds in seven days. In Australia, stock prices on the Sydney and Melbourne exchanges continue to fall, with a drop of 14 million pounds in three days up to the 11th. On the Sydney stock market, 69 industrial and mining stocks fell sharply. On the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in the Danish capital, shares of many large industrial companies and banks fell sharply. Shares of Nordisk Company fell by 5 pounds; shares of Glud & Marstrand hardware factory, Ford Motor Company, and others fell by 3 pounds; shares of Handelsbanken fell by 1.5 pounds. In addition, stock prices have fallen sharply in places like Singapore, Manila (Philippines), and Toronto (Canada).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. London: The British economic situation continues to deteriorate. According to the recent "Emergency White Paper" released by the Labour Party authorities, Britain's trade deficit reached $2.7 billion last year, compared with $1.52 billion in 1946 and only $280 million in 1938. The White Paper believes that this continuous increase in the deficit is due to the difficulty of increasing exports to the countries that Britain needs the most (i.e., the United States, Canada, Argentina, etc.). The White Paper states that in the first half of last year, 47 percent of Britain's total imports came from dollar countries, while its exports to these countries accounted for only 21 percent of the total. To make up for this growing dollar deficit, the Labour government has had to use its limited gold reserves. According to Agence France-Presse on the 8th, citing well-informed sources in London, in the five months from September last year to the end of January this year, Britain sold $618 million worth of gold to the United States from its gold reserves worth $2.4 billion in exchange for U.S. dollars, and purchased $240 million from the International Monetary Fund. Of the $1.124 billion loaned to Britain by Canada in 1946, $500 million was used before August last year, and another $160 million was used during this period. In addition, $300 million was used from the remaining $400 million of the U.S. loan. In total, Britain spent $1.318 billion in these five months. Therefore, Britain is increasingly facing the danger of completely exhausting its gold and dollar reserves. Economic and Financial Secretary Cripps exclaimed on the 11th: "There is a dangerous gap between what Britain earns from exports and what it spends on imports. If this continues, Britain's monetary reserves will only last for six months."

    美国经济的大风暴
    迅速波及英澳等国
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方讯：美国经济的大波动，已开始波及资本主义世界的各大经济中心。伦敦股票市场“掀起了新的抛售浪潮”（塔斯社十二日电），股票价值已跌落了数百万镑。工业股票，尤其是石油股票下跌最猛，英伊石油公司普通股票的价值，在七天内已跌落了二千七百五十万镑。澳州之悉尼和墨尔钵的交易所股票继续下跌，截至十一日止，三天内跌价一千四百万镑，悉尼股票市场中，有六十九种产业和矿业股票大跌。丹麦首都哥本哈根交易所中，许多大产业公司和银行的股票猛跌。诺尔提斯克公司股票跌五镑；格鲁德和马斯特兰五金工厂，福特汽车公司等股票跌三镑；韩德尔斯班肯公司股票跌一镑半。此外，如新加坡、马尼拉（匪律宾）多伦多（加拿大）都发生股票猛跌现象。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】伦敦讯：英国经济情势继续恶化。据最近工党当局所发布之“紧急白皮书”称：去年英贸易入超达二十七亿美元，而一九四六年入超为十五亿二千万美元，一九三八年入超则仅二亿八千万美元。白皮书认为这种赤字之不断增大，乃是因为英国对其需要最多的那些国家（即美国、加拿大、阿根廷等）增加出口，有很多困难。白皮书称：去年上半年，英国进口总额的百分之四十七来自美元国家，而其对这些国家的出口，则仅占总额百分之二十一。为弥补这种日益增大的美元赤字，工党政府乃不得不动用其仅有的黄金储备。据法新社八日引伦敦消息灵通人士称：在去年九月至本年一月底的五个月中，英国已自其所值二十四亿美元的黄金储备中，向美售出了价值六亿一千八百万美元的黄金，以换取美元，同时从“国际货币基金”购进二亿四千万美元。加拿大一九四六年贷给英国的十一亿两千四百万美元中，除去年八月以前用去五亿元以外，这期间又动用了一亿六千万元。另外，自美国贷款余额四亿美元中，用去三亿元。总计这五个月内，英国耗用美元达十三亿一千八百万。因此，英国正日益面临黄金与美元储备完全耗竭的危险。经济兼财政大臣克利浦斯十一日为此大嚷道：“在英国输出所得与输入所费中，存在着一条危险的鸿沟。倘若长此以往，则英国的货币储备，仅能维持半年”。
