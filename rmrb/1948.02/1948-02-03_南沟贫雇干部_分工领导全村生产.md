    Poor and Hired Labor Cadres in Nangou
    Divide Labor to Lead Village Production
    [Pingding News] Nangou, a natural village belonging to Zhangzhuang in the first district of Pingding, had 55 households before the war. Apart from four old middle-peasant households, the remaining 51 households were all from poor tenant-peasant backgrounds, renting over 300 mu of land from landlords. They suffered from landlord exploitation and were always in poverty and hunger. Since liberation, although they initially turned over through rent reduction and debt liquidation, there are still 23 poor peasant households in the village. Due to this year's poor harvest and famine, the entire village of 248 people harvested only 235 shi of grain, averaging less than one shi of grain per person, how can they eat for a year? Therefore, the difficulties are great. The village cadres, who are all poor and hired laborers, specifically divided labor and set an example when they began to organize winter production, leading the masses to actively produce to make up for the famine. The cadres held meetings to discuss and plan to organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women in the village to participate in production. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village were organized into a production brigade, divided into seven groups. The chairman of the labor union, Wu Kuanyao, led the coal miners, a group of eleven people, earning over 300,000 yuan. Deputy Village Head Zhai Shijiu led a small business trading group of thirteen people, earning over 98,000 yuan. Public Security Officer Wang Jucai led three transportation teams with fifteen livestock, running back and forth between Zanhuang and Xingtai, transporting thirteen times in total (carrying coal, carrying feet), earning over 123,000 yuan. Women's Chairman Wu Lizai led four women's textile groups, with fifteen women participating in spinning, spinning thirty jin of cotton, weaving thirty-two zhang of cloth, earning over 15,000 yuan. The remaining semi-able-bodied laborers were led by Kang Qin to dig and burn coal at the kiln without payment, digging a total of 12,000 jin of coal, which, according to the market price at the time, could save 200,000 yuan. Everyone's enthusiasm for production is very high, and their energy is great. This is because the cadres are poor and hired laborers in power, taking the lead as the backbone, recognizing that winter production is mainly for surviving the famine, with organization and planning, and the cadres are clearly assigned to lead, so the effect is great. In production, the masses reflect that as long as you work hard and sell your strength, you can earn money, and only labor and production can solve the difficulties of the famine. Our village cadres lead well! Now the enthusiasm of the cadres and masses in the village for production is very high.

    南沟贫雇干部
    分工领导全村生产
    【平定消息】平定一区张庄所属一个自然村南沟，战前全村五十五户，除四户旧中农外，其余五十一户，完全都是贫佃农出身，租种地主土地三百余亩，他们受了地主剥削，总是饥寒交迫没法过。自解放后，虽然经过减租清债初步翻了身，但现在村上还有二十三户是贫农。由于今年歉收、灾荒，全村二百四十八口人，实收粮二百三十五石，平均一个人连一石粮食都不够，怎么能吃下一年来？因此困难很大。本村干部们，都是穷苦的贫雇，他们在开始组织冬季生产时，即具体分工，以身作则，领导群众积极生产补灾荒窟窿。干部们开会研究讨论，把全村男女全半劳力都有计划的组织起来，参加生产，全村所有全半劳力组织一个生产大队，分为七个小组，工会主席吴宽耀，带领下煤窑工人，一个组十一个人，赚洋三十余万元。副村长翟世九带领小商买卖小组，十三个人，赚洋九万八千余元。公安员王巨才带领三个运输组，牲口十五头，来回跑赞皇、邢台等地，共运输十三次（驮煤炭、驮脚），赚洋十二万三千元。妇女主席吴礼载带领四个妇女纺织组，参加纺织人数十五人，纺花三十斤，织布三十二丈，赚洋一万五千元。其余半劳力由抗勤负责带领到窑上刨煤烧，不用钱，共刨了煤一万二千余斤，按当时市价计算可节省二十万元。大家生产情绪很高，劲头很大，这由于干部是贫雇掌权，带头为骨干，认识到冬季生产主要是为了生产渡荒，有组织、有计划，干部都明确分工带领，这样作用很大。在生产中群众反映是：只要吃苦卖力，就能赚钱，只有劳动生产，才能解决灾荒困难。俺村干部们，领导可沾！现在该村干部群众生产的劲头非常大。
