West Lake Model Village
Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Starve During the New Year
Correspondent's Letter

Editor:

From the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month, I went to West Lake Village in the second district of Wu'an to promote the Outline Land Law, and returned on the 28th. In these four days, because I was unfamiliar with both the people and the place, I superficially learned about the serious grievances and sufferings among the hired and poor peasants. These things were personally told to me by the hired and poor peasants in their homes.

West Lake Village has three hundred households and is a key central village (according to the village cadres). In the past, it was a model village in the second district. During the production movement, it once engaged in competitions and challenges with other villages. Based on the materials I obtained, there are many problems in this model village.

West Lake Village has a Guo Shulong, who is forty-eight years old. At the age of sixteen, he started working as a long-term laborer for landlords and rich peasants. He has been a "long-term laborer" for thirty years until after liberation in 1945. Now he is still a bachelor, wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket from four years ago that barely covers his body. He said that during the fruit distribution, the cadres wanted to give him a foreign cloth gown, but how could he wear that to pick manure and chop firewood? Because he didn't want it, it was simply dropped. Song Lao Si has been begging for three generations. When he was a teenager, he ran far away, begging for food and carrying a broken pot. While telling his story, he pointed to his eldest child's tattered jacket, saying that if it weren't for the broken cloth shirt with a large collar underneath, his belly would be exposed. When they talked about being expelled from the Farmers' Association by the village chief, their eyes filled with tears. Song Lao Si said: "We were expelled by the village chief together on the evening of March 29th this year, and we were detained for a whole night. That night, I saw people going to the toilet in the yard. I thought it was too crowded, so I urinated outside the door, and they said I was disrupting the meeting. That night, the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association taught us to make false confessions. He told me to learn from him. He said that if we didn't admit it, the village chief would smash us to pieces." (Meaning to kill). So they admitted their mistakes. The next day, they were released. Although they were no longer detained, I was so angry that I was crazy for ten days.

Then he continued: "We have nothing to wear, and people say we are being careful. We really have nothing, what can we do? We got a little over ten points during the fruit distribution, which is neither too much nor too little. When the fruit accounts were read that day, I heard the cadres borrowing 30,000 here and 50,000 there. The director of the armed committee borrowed 70,000 or 80,000 to marry his wife, who cares about us!" Around the lunar New Year, it was discovered that eleven households of hired and poor peasants had nothing to eat and were about to have their pots taken away. Zhang Lao San was going to beg for food because he had nothing to eat. Zhang Heyi is a tenant farmer who is a bachelor because he is poor. In the past, he had one mu of his own land. In addition to renting land, he often did odd jobs to make a living. Last year, he was allocated fruit. He planted two mu of millet, which grew very well, but was eaten by insects and only yielded one stone and two dou. Because he had nothing to eat in the spring and summer, he borrowed grain and had to return six dou and five sheng in the autumn. He paid 69 jin and 2 liang of public grain rice and over 100 jin of millet for labor (including mutual aid and supporting the government). When he was forced by public grain, Zhao, the political commissar of the second district, lent him 3,000 yuan while working in the village. In the days near the lunar New Year, he was worried to death. He said that times are hard now. Begging for food is no longer popular. Doing odd jobs has fewer opportunities. Chopping firewood requires capital, and there will be nothing to eat in the autumn. Except for a few times of production, he has been begging for food ever since. There is also an orphan named Wang Youde, whose parents died early. He started begging for food at the age of five or six and slept in the Guandi Temple. He is fourteen years old this year. After the emancipation movement, he still has no house or land. The poor are suffering so much, but some of the targets of struggle still have means. Wang Rende's family ground white flour for a whole day during the New Year, at least three large dou of wheat. (Ru Xiu)

    西湖模范村
    贫雇过年挨饿

    编辑同志：
    我从古历十二月二十四日到武安二区西湖村宣传土地法大纲，到二十八日返回。在这四天时间，因我人地两生，很肤浅的了解到雇贫农当中存在着严重的冤苦事，这些事情都是亲自到雇贫农家中，他们给我亲自谈出。
    西湖村有三百户人家，是一个基点中心村（据本村干部说），过去是二区的模范村。在生产运动中曾向其他村进行竞赛挑战，根据我得到的材料看，模范村里问题很多。
    西湖村有个郭书龙，四十八岁。在十六岁就给地主富农做长工，一直做到一九四五年解放后，整整干了“长工”三十年，现在仍当着光棍汉，上身穿的四年前的破棉袄，四面不着体。他说在分果实时，干部要给咱洋布大袍子，咱能穿那东西去拾粪，去拾砍？因为咱没要，也就白拉倒。宋老四，是连三辈要饭吃的，他本人在十几岁就连要饭带锢鹿锅，往远处跑。他在诉说时，指着他那大孩的上身穿的破袄说，要不是里边套着那个有大衿的破布衫，就要露出肚子来。他们说到被村长将他俩开除农会时，眼里都滴了泪。宋老四说：俺俩是今年三月二十九日晚被村长一齐开除的，还将俺俩扣了一黑夜，我在那晚会上见人家都去毛子（厕所）里尿去，毛子在院中，我看人太挤，到门外尿了一泡，就说我捣乱了会场。当夜农会副主席教我们假坦白，他说我学。他说要不承认，村长说还要将我们捣了的。（砸死的意思）。就这样承认了不对，第二天放了，虽然不扣了，把我气的疯了十来天。
    接着他又说：“咱们没穿的，人家说咱仔细，本来咱没有，有啥办法？俺们分果实，共十多分，到现在不长不短。那天念果实帐时，听伢干部们这个借三万，那个借五万，武委会主任娶老婆借了七、八万，谁管咱！”在旧历年关左右已发现十一户雇贫农没吃的，将要扣起锅。张老三因没吃的要去要饭吃。张合衣是个佃贫农，因为穷，当光棍汉，过去自有地一亩，除租地外，常与人打短工糊口，去年分给果实，地他种了二亩谷子，长的很好，但却被虫吃的只收了一石二斗。因春夏没吃的，借的粮到秋后就归还六斗五升，出公粮米六十九斤二两，还出工米（包括互助与支差）小米一百多斤。公粮逼的没办法时，二区赵政委在这村工作借给他三千元。在过旧年关近几天，愁的要死他。说现在世道不好过，想着要饭吃不兴了，打短工吧，用家少了，咱拾砍吧，没本钱，秋后就没吃的，除生产了几次外，一直目下是要饭。还有一个父母早亡的孤儿王有的，在五六岁上就要饭，睡在关帝庙，今年十四岁了，经过翻身运动，却仍然房地皆无。穷人这样苦，但有的斗争对象还有办法，王仁德家过年磨了一天白面，顶少能磨三大斗麦。（儒修）
