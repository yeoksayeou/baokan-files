　　Actively Preparing for Spring Plowing
　　Huguan Farmers Work Hard to Deliver Manure
　　[Huguan News] This spring's work is particularly heavy, as we must both equally distribute land and seize the time to plant early. Many villagers in Huguan are taking advantage of the absence of cadres who are away for study to deliver manure in large quantities. Villagers in Shuzhang Village, Sixth District, began as early as the second day of the Lunar New Year, and have already delivered more than 3,500 loads of manure to the fields in five days. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, when repairing the manure delivery road, the people of Guojia Tuo Village in the Fourth District discussed while repairing the road: How will we wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year tomorrow? Cui Xinglong said: Let's wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year with production and frugality. Cui Liuzhi said: I guarantee to get everyone up early tomorrow to deliver manure. Our Guojia Tuo will wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year with increased production and manure delivery. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, before the rooster crowed, Cui Juhe called up forty-two people, and while carrying manure, shouted: Get up quickly and deliver manure! One hundred and twenty-nine people, fifteen ox carts, delivered a total of nine hundred and eighty-five loads of fertilizer in one morning. After breakfast, everyone hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao and wished him a Happy New Year. They also proposed: We cannot make empty promises to Chairman Mao. We must resolutely complete the delivery of fertilizer by the tenth day of the Lunar New Year. Wang Lianzhong (poor peasant/hired laborer, veteran), the public security director of Zhuangtou Village in the First District, collected manure from three mu of land last winter. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, when others were busy preparing for the New Year, he still picked up two baskets of manure. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, he picked up another four baskets, and on the second day, he carried manure to the fields. His family has a total of four people, with a fifteen-year-old child and a twelve-year-old child. The two children carried manure together while he carried it himself. By the ninth day of the Lunar New Year, they had carried all two hundred and seventy loads of manure. At the group New Year's gathering in Qinji Zhuang Village, Third District, it was proposed to wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year with production and frugality. On the morning of the second day, four carts began delivering fertilizer. Guo Xiping, a poor peasant/hired laborer in Beijie, Chengguan, First District, Cheng Haidong, an elderly military dependent over fifty years old, and Liang Jinlian, the village chief of Nanguan Village, all delivered fertilizer to the fields at dawn on the second day of the Lunar New Year. When Long Shaochi in the Fourth District began delivering manure, the people thought that the land had not been equally distributed, and they did not know where to deliver it. After a family meeting of poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants was held on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, and the Land Law Outline was studied in detail again, especially after repeated explanations were made about the policy towards middle peasants, everyone began to understand. A manure delivery plan was drawn up on the spot, and the delivery began on the second day and was completed by the tenth day. As soon as dawn broke on the second day, Yang Yuesheng and others got up to deliver manure. They all said: In the past, labor was for the landlords! Now it is our own, how can we not work? Sheep herder Guo Shibao got up before dawn to deliver manure and then herded sheep after breakfast. Guo Tianxi, thirteen years old, lost his father and lives with his mother. These days, he doesn't even have time to eat, so he holds a bowl and drives a donkey to deliver manure. In the inspection on the sixth day, more than sixty of the ninety-odd households in the village had delivered all their manure.

　　积极准备春耕
  　壶关农民努力送粪
    【壶关消息】今春工作特别繁重，要平分土地，又要乘晌早种。壶关许多村庄群众乘干部学习未回来的机会大量送粪。六区树掌村群众从正月初二就已开始，五天内已送到地里粪三千五百多担。四区郭家驼群众在腊月三十日修送肥路时，一面修路，一面讨论：明天怎样给毛主席拜年。崔兴龙说：咱拿生产节约给毛主席拜年。崔六支说：我保证明天打早把大家叫起来送粪，咱郭家驼要拿多生产多送粪给毛主席拜年。第二天大年初一，鸡还没叫，崔聚和就叫起四十二个人，一面担着粪，一面喊叫说：都赶快起来送粪吧！一百二十九个人，十五辆牛车，一个清早共送肥九百八十五担。吃完早饭，大家挂起毛主席像，给毛主席拜年。并提出：对着毛主席不能说空话，到初十坚决把肥送完。一区庄头公安主任王连忠（贫雇、退伍军人）去冬拾了三亩地的粪，腊月三十日别人忙着准备过年，他还拾了两箩头粪。大年初一还拾了四箩头，初二就往地里担粪。他家共四口人，有一个十五岁的小孩，一个十二岁的小孩，二个小孩抬，他自己担，到初九就把二百七十担粪全部担完。三区秦家庄村在团拜大会上，提出要以生产节约来给毛主席拜年。初二早晨就有四辆车开始送肥。一区城关北街贫雇郭喜平、五十余岁的老军属程海东、南关村长梁金莲等，都在初二天明就往地里送肥。四区龙邵池开始送粪时，群众认为没平分了土地，不知往那块地送。经腊月二十八召开了贫雇中农一家人会议，对土地法大纲又进行了详细研究，特别对中农政策再三作了解释，大家开始想通，当场订出了送粪计划，初二开始到初十完成。初二刚明，杨月生等就起来送粪。都说：过去劳动是给地主受哩！现在是自己的，不劳动还行？羊工郭石保天不明就起来送粪，吃早饭后放羊。十三岁的郭天喜，他父亲死了，和他娘二人过活。这几天连饭也顾不上吃，端上碗赶着驴送粪。在初六检查，全村九十多户，已有六十余户送光了。
