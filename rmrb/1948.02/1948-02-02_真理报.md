	*Pravda*
	By Z. Hailin
	Translated by Cao Ying
	In this massive edifice resembling a steamship, the lights never go out. In the skies above Moscow, like a bright flame, a word burns all night long – a word connected to the heroic revolutionary struggle of the Soviet people to realize communism. These are six dazzling letters:
	PRAVDA (Truth)
	Early in the morning, the streets of Moscow are still deserted, and Leningrad Avenue is also empty. However, several trucks covered with tarpaulins appear on this avenue early in the morning.
	They drive one after another from "Pravda Street," and it is not difficult to follow them on such an early morning. The trucks drive to all the post offices and postal agencies in the capital. They rush to the railway stations and airports. The trucks are loaded with brown paper bags covered with tarpaulins. Inside the bags are neatly arranged bundles of daily newspapers and magazines published by "Pravda Publishing House" on that day. Two or three hours later, all these paper bags set out on their journeys. The postal vehicles distributing "Pravda" travel 121,394 kilometers along railway lines alone. More than 50,000 post offices deliver daily newspapers and magazines from "Pravda Publishing House" to subscribers.
	"For clarity," Lenin wrote in February 1921, "let us take a small number as an example: throughout Russia, 'Izvestia' sells 350,000 copies, and 'Pravda' sells 250,000 copies. We are poor, we have no paper."
	Fifteen years later, Stalin said at the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of the Union: "Furthermore: everyone talks about freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, but forgets that all these freedoms can become an empty sound for the working class if it cannot obtain suitable meeting places, good printing presses, and sufficient paper."
	In the Soviet Union, the working class possesses these conditions. Even those who previously "found Moscow unbelievable" based on personal understanding have indeed come to believe this. In 1937, the writer Lion Feuchtwanger, who visited the editorial office of "Pravda," described his impressions:
	"I visited the new printing plant of 'Pravda,' the best-selling daily newspaper in Moscow. We wandered around the massive rotary press, which has the world's leading productivity; it prints two million copies of the newspaper in two hours. The entire printing press is like a huge locomotive, and its platform, which is eighty meters long, is like the deck of a steamship, where one can stroll. After wandering around the printing press for about a quarter of an hour, I suddenly noticed that this machine only occupied half of the factory building, and the other half was empty. I asked why. The answer was: 'Now we only print two million copies of 'Pravda.' But we still have five million subscription applications. As soon as our paper mill can supply us with enough paper, we will install a second printing press.'"
	The war hindered the installation of this machine. During the war, factories were busy fulfilling military orders. Soviet paper mills suffered severe blows from the occupiers. However, "Pravda" has grown vigorously during these years.
	... Let's run inside the "Pravda" building and take a look! Trains loaded with paper come here every day along their own specially built railway branch line. On the platform, we can meet a middle-aged man wearing glasses. Like a shrewd boss, he attentively watches the unloading of the train. His name is Vasily Antonovich Prikhodzhiko. On April 22nd (May 5th, New Style) of the old lunar calendar in 1912, he composed the first issue of "Pravda." This day became the Bolshevik publishing festival. Dozens of Lenin's and Stalin's manuscripts have passed through Prikhodzhiko's hands. He remembers very clearly the situation when Molotov served as the secretary of the "Pravda" editorial department.
	"Molotov always came to our typesetting room with the proof sheets he had proofread. He would not leave the printing plant until the newspaper was published," Prikhodzhiko recalled. "We often asked Comrade Molotov when he slept. During the day, he worked in the editorial department, and at night he worked in the night editorial department, until the newspaper was published, and he even helped distribute the newspaper, sending it to factories everywhere."
	"In the past, all typesetting was based on the author's manuscript. Each time, various different fonts had to be changed. Comrade Molotov often helped the typesetting workers, explaining to them the meaning of individual words and articles."
	We listen to the simple and unadorned conversation of the oldest worker of "Pravda," who is still working in the newspaper office. As he speaks, rolls of new newspapers slide along the wooden conveyor into the rotary press. If the newspapers used by "Pravda" Publishing House in one year were connected together, then this strip could circle the earth fifteen times.
	The former typesetting foreman describes how Lenin and Stalin used workers' donations to start a small newspaper, and how this small newspaper grew into today's "Pravda" – it is a very touching story.
	Between the lines of "Pravda," the heartbeat of the powerful Soviet state is hidden. In September 1945, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party awarded the Order of Lenin to "Pravda," it said that it believed that "'Pravda' will continue to gloriously carry out the task of the standard-bearer of Lenin-Stalin party consciousness, and use the power of Bolshevik language to encourage the Soviet people to complete new labor achievements in order to continue to consolidate the power of our great socialist motherland, and economic and cultural prosperity."
	... In 1941, the glass windows of the "Pravda" building rattled from the shock waves of shells. On a plane surveying instrument of a German pilot shot down over Moscow, a map was found. On this map, 24 Pravda Street (the location of the "Pravda" building x) was also marked with a cross, just like the most important military targets in the capital.
	However, "Pravda" never stopped its work for a minute during these difficult years. Moreover, airplanes loaded with paper plates were still sent to besieged Leningrad as usual every morning. The printing plant in Leningrad that printed "Pravda" was often under siege by artillery fire. Printing workers worked in hunger and cold. The pilots transporting the paper plates were forced to land several times under the gunfire of German anti-aircraft guns. Two airplanes were shot down. However, the paper plates continued to arrive in Leningrad, and the residents of this heroic city never lost their motherland's newspaper.
	Now, the paper plates of "Pravda" are sent to Kyiv, Kharkiv, the Don, Rostov, Baku, Tashkent, Novosibirsk, Kuibyshev, and recently also to Khabarovsk. The planes transporting the paper plates travel 22,000 kilometers every day.
	The versions of "Pravda" even extend to places that trains and ships cannot reach, airplanes do not land, and cars and trucks cannot pass. In the Allaikha region of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (in the far north of Siberia), newspapers and magazines are delivered by reindeer and dogs. Residents of Anadyr (in the far east of Siberia) can also receive publications published by "Pravda" Publishing House. Thirty-six subscribers to "Pravda" live in Nikolskoye village in the Kamchatka Oblast, Aleutian District. Gold miners in Aldan also subscribe to "Pravda," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," "Culture and Life," "Bolshevik," "Spark," and "Young Pioneer," etc.
	Residents of Uzhhorod, who previously could not see Soviet publications, now subscribe to 3,722 copies of daily newspapers and magazines published by "Pravda" Publishing House. There are 2,829 subscribers in Mukachevo (Uzhhorod and Mukachevo are on the border between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia). In the former Königsberg, now Kaliningrad, there are 13,192 subscribers. Residents of South Sakhalin Island (Karafuto Prefecture) regularly receive 904 daily newspapers and 839 magazines.
	"Pravda" and its other publications are also read outside the Soviet Union. It extends to the most remote corners of the earth. Its subscribers are distributed in 59 countries. The magazine "Spark" can be received in 43 countries, including: Australia, India, New Zealand, Cuba, Chile, South Africa... There are 55 subscribers in India. There are 1,316 subscribers in Palestine.
	Thousands of tangible and intangible lines connect "Pravda" with every corner of the world, but first of all with the various nationalities of the Soviet Federation. The mail that "Pravda" sends and receives every day is almost no less than all the mail of a small city. There is no event that is not immediately reported to "Pravda." The "Pravda" building occupies 70,000 square meters. However, if the space occupied by the daily newspaper correspondents distributed throughout the Soviet Union is added together, then this area is not known how much larger it would be.
	The most famous scholars, writers, party and economic workers, ministers and workers, farmers and students publish articles in "Pravda." Every Soviet citizen deeply loves their newspaper and trusts the ideas hidden within it. They ask the newspaper for instructions, make suggestions, and ask for help.
	Stalin's "Pravda" printing plant works day and night.
	Before newspapers and magazines fall into the hands of readers, they must go through nearly a hundred complex production procedures. Every line of words is the result of long and tenacious labor. However, the staff in the newspaper office know how much Soviet readers cherish their labor and how much they long for the Bolshevik truth.
	When the workers who print the daily newspapers go home in the morning, they are greeted by the workers who print the magazines. At midnight, those who work next to the large rotary presses come out again. At one o'clock at night, the paper workers load the rolls of paper onto the machines. Then the machine printers and foremen also come, and they prepare the machines for printing. At this time, the typesetting machine typesets the last few lines of words. At four or five o'clock in the morning, the most tense moment in the printing plant begins. Everyone is waiting for the last column signed by the editor. Eighteen to twenty minutes later, a fresh newspaper must be placed on the editor's desk.
	In these few minutes of tense time, when the first manuscript is sent from the pneumatic delivery station (a new method of delivering mail), there is not much time left. But in this short period of time, every second is like a spring, and the rhythm of life of these people is like this. They have dedicated everything. They have not known the silence of the night for decades. The whole country should receive fresh newspapers in the morning.
	In addition to "Pravda," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," and "Culture and Life," the following magazines are also printed here: "Bolshevik," "Historical Problems," "Farm Woman," "Crocodile," "World Economy and World Politics," "Spark" and its various supplements, as well as "October," "Party Life," "Young Pioneer," "Working Woman," "Alternation," "Soviet Women," "Soviet Books," etc.
	After all the paper, covers and magazine inserts are printed, they are sent to the binding workshop. Only magazines that come out of here become the way the mailman delivers them to us. But before that, it has to go through several inspection procedures. Every page of paper, every magazine must be proofread. The inspector's number must also be stamped on it. Before packing and affixing labels – "Spark" fifteen issues sixty copies – each magazine must be proofread again. Now, the whole bundles of magazines slide along the transport tubes to the post office's car. From here, the magazines reach the hands of subscribers...
	Days full of new events and heroic deeds of the Soviet people are coming every day. The people in the building at 24 Pravda Street who prepare the materials for daily newspapers and magazines are always the first to know these things. In this huge building, whether it is Sunday or a major holiday, the boiling life never stops for a minute. (Dalian "Truth Daily")

    真理报
    Ｚ·海林作
    草婴译
    在这座邮船似的巨厦里，灯光是永远不灭的。在莫斯科的高空里，象一朵明亮的火焰，整夜燃烧着一个词儿——一个跟苏联人民为实现共产主义而进行英雄性的革命斗争有关系的词儿。这是六个光辉夺目的字母：
    ＰＲＡＶＤＡ（真理）
    清早，莫斯科的街道上还没有人迹，列宁格勒大街也是一片空旷。不过，这条大街上，一早就出现了几辆盖着防雨布的卡车。
    它们接一连二地从“真理报街”开出来，在这样的清早要尾随它们是并不困难的。卡车驶向首都所有的邮政局和邮政代办所。它们赶向火车站和飞机场。卡车上装着棕色纸袋，上面盖着防雨布。纸袋里整齐地放着一束一束的“真理报出版社”当天所出的日报和杂志。二三小时之后，所有这些纸袋都出发旅行。分发“真理报”的邮车，单只沿铁路线，就要走十二万一千三百九十四公里的路程。给定户递送“真理报出版社”的日报和杂志的邮政分局在五万所以上。
    “为了明白起见，”列宁在一九二一年二月曾经这么写过“让我们举个小小的数字为例：在全俄罗斯，‘消息报’销售三十五万份，‘真理报’销售二十五万份。我们穷，我们没有纸张。”
    经过十五年之后，斯大林在第八届联邦非常大会上说道：“还有：大家谈论着言论、集会和出版的自由，可是却忘记所有这些自由，对于工人阶级都可能成为一种空洞的声音，如果它不可能获得适当的会所，良好的印刷所，足量的纸张等。”
    在苏联，工人阶级是拥有这些条件的。这层就连先前根据个人的认识“觉得莫斯科不可信”的人们，也确实相信了。一九三七年访问“真理报”编辑部的作家李翁·菲赫特文格曾这样描写自己的印象：
    “我参观了莫斯科最畅销的日报‘真理报’的新印刷所。我们徘徊在那架生产率居世界首位的，庞大的滚筒机的旁边；在二小时之内它印刷了二百万份报纸。整个印刷机象一具庞大的火车头，它那长达八十公尺的平台，象邮船上的甲板似的可以在上面散步。在印刷机旁边逛了一刻钟光景，我忽然注意到这座机器只占厂房的一半，而还有一半却是空的。我问是什么缘故。回答我说：‘现在我们只印二百万份‘真理报’。可是我们却还有五百万份的定户申请书，一等到我们的造纸工厂能够供给我们足够的纸张，我们就装置第二架印刷机。’”
    战争妨碍了这架机器的装置。在战时，工厂都忙于应付军事定货。苏联造纸厂受到了占领者的严重打击。然而，“真理报”却在这几年里有力地生长着。
    ……让我们跑到“真理报”馆的内部去瞧瞧吧！装运纸张的火车，每天沿着自己特建的铁路支线，开到这里来。在月台上我们可以遇见一个戴眼镜的中年男子。他象一个精明的老板，留神地注视着火车的卸货。他叫华西里·安东诺维奇·普里霍吉珂。他在一九一二年旧历四月二十二日（新历五月五日）拼了第一号“真理报”的版子。这个日子就成了全布尔塞维克出版节。几十份列宁和斯大林的手稿曾经经过普里霍吉珂的双手。他很清楚地记得莫洛托夫任“真理报”编辑部书记时的情形。
    “莫洛托夫总是拿着校阅过的清样，跑到我们排字房里来，他一直要等到报纸出版，才离开印刷所。”普里霍吉珂回忆时说。“我们常常问莫洛托夫同志，他是在什么时候睡觉的。白天他在编辑部里工作，晚上他在夜编辑部里，一直要等到报纸出版，而且还帮助分发报纸，把它送到各处的工厂里去。”
    “从前全部排字都是根据作者的手稿的。每次都得更换各种不同的字体。莫洛托夫同志常常帮助排字工人，给他们解释单字和文章的意义。”
    我们听着“真理报”最老的，而且现在还在报馆里工作的工人的朴实无华的谈话。在他谈话的时候，一筒筒新的报纸沿着木制的运输机滑到滚筒机里去。假使把“真理报”出版社一年里所用去的报纸联接起来，那末这条带子就可以围绕地球十五转。
    前排字工头描述列宁和斯大林怎样利用工人捐款创办一张小型的报纸，这张小报又怎样成长为今天的“真理报”，——这是一篇非常动人的小说。
    在“真理报”的字里行间，潜藏着强大的苏维埃国家的心的跳动。一九四五年九月，当共产党中央委员会以列宁勋章授予“真理报”时说，相信“‘真理报’将继续光荣地执行列宁——斯大林党意识的旗手的任务，并且利用布尔塞维克言语的力量，鼓励苏联人民，为了继续巩固我们伟大的社会主义祖国的威力，和经济与文化的繁荣，去完成新的劳动业绩。”
    ……一九四一年“真理报”大厦的玻璃窗曾经被炮弹震动的格格作响。在莫斯科上空被击落的一个德国飞机师的平面测量器上，曾经发现一张地图，在这张地图上“真理报”街二十四号（“真理报”馆的所在地×）也象首都最重要的军事目标那样，上面画着一个十字。
    然而，“真理报”在这些艰难的年份里，却一分钟也不曾停止过自己的工作。而且，每天早晨装着纸版的飞机也照常送到被围困的列宁格勒去。列宁格勒印刷“真理报”的那家印刷所，经常处在炮火的围击中。印刷工人在饥寒交迫的情况下工作。运输纸版的飞机师，几次在德军高射炮火的射击下被迫降落。有二架飞机被击落。但是，纸版还是始终继续到达列宁格勒，这个英雄城的居民不曾失去祖国的报纸。
    现在，“真理报”的纸版被送到基辅、哈尔科夫、顿河、罗斯托夫、巴库、塔什干、诺伏西比尔斯克、库壁希夫，最近还送到伯力去。运送纸版的飞机每天要经过二万二千公里的路程。
    “真理报”的版本甚至伸展到那些火车，轮船达不到，飞机不着陆，汽车、卡车不能通行的地方。雅库茨自治共和国的阿拉伊哈（在西比利亚的极北部），报纸和杂志是用鹿和狗递送过去的。阿拿第尔（在西比利亚的极东部）的居民也可以收到“真理报”馆出版的刊物，在堪察加州、阿留申区的尼珂尔斯克村里居住着三十六个“真理报”的定户。阿尔丹的淘金者也订阅“真理报”、“共青真理报”、“文化与生活”、“布尔塞维克”、“火花”、“少年先锋”等书报。
    乌士高洛德的居民以前看不到苏联刊物，现在订了三千七百二十二份“真理报”馆出版的日报和杂志。在摩卡切夫（乌士高洛德和摩卡切夫在苏联和捷克的边境）有二千八百二十九个定户。在过去的克尼斯堡，现在的加里宁格勒，有一万三千一百九十二个定户。南萨哈林岛（库页岛）的居民经常收到九百零四份日报和八百三十九份杂志。
    “真理报”和它的其他出版物，在苏联国境之外，也有人阅读。它伸入到地球上最遥远的角落。它的定户分布在五十九个国家里。在四十三个国家里可以收到“火花”杂志，其中包括：澳洲、印度、新西兰、古巴、智利、南菲洲……在印度有五十五个定户。在巴勒斯坦有一千三百十六个定户。
    几千条有形和无形的线，把“真理报”跟全世界每个角落联接着，不过，首先是跟苏维埃联邦的各民族联接着。“真理报”每日收发的邮件简直不比一个小城市的全部邮件少。没有一种事件，不是立即报导给“真理报”的。“真理报”的大厦占地七万方公尺。不过，假使把分布在全苏联土地上的日报通讯员所占的空间算在一起的话，那末这块场地就不知还要广大多少了。
    在“真理报”发表文章的，有最著名的学者、作家、党和经济方面的工作人员、部长和工人、农民和学生。每个苏联公民都深爱自己的报纸，信任它潜藏着的思想。他们请求报纸给予指示，提出建议，请求帮助。
    斯大林“真理报”印刷所日夜不歇地工作着。
    不论报纸和杂志，在落到读者的手里以前，要经过近一百个复杂的生产手续。每一行字句都是长久和顽强劳动的结果。不过报馆里的工作人员都知道，苏联的读者怎样珍重他们的劳动，他们怎样渴望着布尔塞维克的真话。
    当印刷日报的工人们早晨回家去的时候，迎面跑来的是印刷杂志的工人们。到半夜里这些在大卷筒机旁边工作的人们又重新出来了。在夜里一点钟，装纸工人把卷筒纸装在机器上。接着机印工人和领班工人也跑来了，他们把机器准备好，以便印刷。这时排字机排上了最后几行字。早上四、五点钟，开始了印刷所里最紧张的时刻。大家都在等待编辑签过字的最后一栏。十八——二十分钟之后，一份新鲜的报纸必须放在编辑的台子上。
    在这几分钟紧张的时间里，当第一份手稿从气压递送站（递送邮件的新方法）送到时，留下的时间就不很多了。不过在这段短时间里，每一秒钟都象一根发条，这些人们的生活规律就是如此。他们献出了一切。他们已经有几十年不知道什么叫夜的寂静。一到早晨，全国就应该收到新鲜的报纸。
    除了“真理报”、“共青真理报”和“文化与生活”之外，这里还印行下列各种杂志：“布尔塞维克”、“历史问题”、“农女”、“鳄鱼”、“世界经济与世界政治”、“火花”和它的各种附刊，还有“十月”、“党生活”、“少年先锋”、“工女”、“交替”、“苏联妇女”、“苏联图书”等。
    在全部纸张，封面和杂志的插页印成之后，它们就被送入装订工场。只有从这里出来的杂志方成为邮差送给我们时的那个样子。不过在这以前，还要经过几部检查的手续。每页纸头，每本杂志都要校阅过。上面还要盖上检查员的号码。在装包和帖上标签——“火花”十五期六十本，——以前，每本杂志还要再经过一次校阅。到现在，整扎的杂志才沿着运输管滑到邮局的汽车里去。再从这里，杂志到达定户的手里……。
    充满新事件和苏联人民英雄事迹的日子每天在到来。“真理报”街二十四号大厦里准备日报和杂志材料的人们，总是最先知道这些事情。在这巨大的建筑物里，不论星期日，不论重大的节日，沸腾的生活一分钟也不停止。（大连“实话报”）
