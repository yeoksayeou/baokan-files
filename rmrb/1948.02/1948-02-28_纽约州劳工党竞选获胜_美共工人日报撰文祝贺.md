　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 24th: According to TASS, New York, the "overwhelming victory" of Labor Party candidate Isaacson in the New York State Congressional by-election on the 17th of this month shows that Wallace's third-party movement has gained the support of the broad masses. The US Communist Party's Worker's Daily published an article congratulating the victory, believing that this expresses "the voice of the real America. The real America has finally had the opportunity to speak." The newspaper also pointed out: It is a significant fact that American working-class voters, disregarding the opposition of senior trade union leaders to Wallace, still supported Isaacson. The afternoon newspaper declared that the broad masses of voters supported the Labor Party because Isaacson is a "combative progressive." Isaacson's victory greatly alarmed the two major reactionary parties, the Democratic and Republican parties. The New York Times, the mouthpiece of the Democratic Party, was forced to admit: "This matter has made the leaders of all parties realize that Wallace will get more votes in the presidential election than expected," and "Truman is unlikely to win in the important state of New York." The Republican New York Herald Tribune also shouted and yelled: "Wallace's third party can no longer be regarded as an 'insignificant threat' and ignored."

　　纽约州劳工党竞选获胜  美共工人日报撰文祝贺
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：美劳工党候选人伊萨克逊在本月十七日国会补选纽约州众议员选举中所获的“压倒胜利”，显示华莱士第三党运动已获得广大群众的拥护。美共工人日报撰文祝贺，认为这是表达了“真正美国的呼声。真正的美国，终于获得了发言的机会”。该报并指出：美工人阶级选民不顾工会高级领袖反对华莱士，仍旧拥护伊萨克逊，这是具有重大意义的事实。下午报宣称：广大选民支持劳工党，因为伊萨克逊是“战斗性的进步分子”。伊萨克逊的胜利使民主和共和两大反动党大为慌张。民主党的喉舌纽约时报被迫承认：“此事使各党领袖都认识到华莱士在总统选举中所获选票会比预料的票数多”，“杜鲁门不可能在重要的纽约州获胜”。共和党的纽约先驱论坛报也大叫大嚷说：“华莱士的第三党，再不能看做是“无所谓的威胁”，而置之不理了。
