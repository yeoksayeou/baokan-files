    Northeast Military Region Political Department
    Investigates the Native Place of Liberated Soldiers
    Preparing to Distribute Land to Them
    [Xinhua News Agency Northeast Dispatch] The Political Department of the Military Region recently issued an order to investigate the native places of liberated soldiers in our army and commanders and fighters whose families are in the KMT-controlled areas, so as to notify local governments and peasant associations to distribute property and land to them in the same way as to peasants, now or in the future. The order roughly stated: "All units should immediately investigate: (1) liberated soldiers; (2) soldiers who are not liberated soldiers but whose families are in the KMT-controlled areas. Report the native places of these two types of commanders and fighters to this Headquarters, so that liberated soldiers whose families are in the liberated areas can be notified by this Headquarters to local governments and peasant associations to distribute land and property to themselves and their families. Those whose families are in the KMT-controlled areas (regardless of whether they are liberated soldiers or soldiers who voluntarily joined the army) will have their names kept by this Headquarters, and after their hometowns are liberated, local governments and peasant associations will be notified to distribute land and property to themselves and their families. The glorious martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary war will still be able to obtain land and property for themselves and their families and receive condolences after their hometowns are liberated."

    【新华社东北电】军区政治部顷颁发命令，调查我军解放战士及家在蒋管区的指战员籍贯，以便通知当地政府及农会在现在或将来分给与农民同样的财产及土地。命令略称：“各部队应即调查：（一）解放战士；（二）虽不是解放战士，但家在蒋管区的战士，把这两类指战员的籍贯报告本部，以便使家在解放区内之解放战士，均可由本部通知当地政府和农会，分给其本人及其家庭以土地财产。其家在蒋管区者（不论解放战士和自动参军的战士）则由本部保存名册，待其家乡解放后，通知当地政府和农会，分给其本人和家庭以土地财产。在革命战争中英勇牺牲的光荣烈士，待其家乡解放后，其本人及其家庭，仍可同样分得土地财产，并得到抚恤。”
