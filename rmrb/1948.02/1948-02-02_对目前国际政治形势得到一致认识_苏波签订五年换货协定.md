Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Moscow Dispatch: The Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka, leading a government delegation including the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minc, arrived in Moscow on the 16th of this month. After more than ten days of talks with Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Molotov, Deputy Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mikoyan, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others, the two governments have reached an agreement on major political and economic issues between the two countries and the current international political situation. On the 26th, they signed a trade agreement for the period of 1948 to 1952, and an agreement for the Soviet Union to supply Poland with industrial equipment. The former agreement stipulates that the total value of trade between the two countries will reach more than one billion US dollars in five years. The Soviet Union will supply Poland with: iron, chromium, aluminum, manganese ore, sand, petroleum products, cotton, asbestos, automobiles, and tractors. Poland will supply the Soviet Union with: coal, coking coal, textiles, steel products, sugar, zinc, railway carriages, and cement. The prices of various goods will be determined by both parties in advance each year based on international prices. The latter agreement stipulates that from 1948 to 1956, the Soviet Union will regularly supply Poland with equipment for various new large-scale metallurgical plants, power, chemical, and textile factories, as well as equipment for rebuilding cities and ports. To this end, the Soviet Union will provide Poland with a credit loan of 450 million US dollars. In addition, the Soviet Union has agreed to sell Poland another 200,000 tons of grain on credit, in addition to the 300,000 tons of grain already determined to be shipped to Poland. This grain will be delivered in full within three months. The representatives of the two countries also exchanged views and reached an agreement on the implementation of the technical cooperation agreement signed on April 5th of last year, and on the issue of Poland's compensation to the Soviet Union for German property in Poland in 1948. Stalin hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the Polish delegation after the signing of the agreement on the 26th. The Polish delegation returned to Poland the next day.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Moscow Dispatch: Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz made a speech before leaving the Soviet Union on the 27th, stating: This visit to the Soviet Union has given the governments of our two countries the opportunity to reach a completely unified understanding of the current international situation, and has also enabled us to reach a completely unified understanding of the methods for the economic revival of our countries that have been devastated by war, as well as the path that these countries should follow to develop their economies and maintain their sovereign integrity. These views have been fully embodied in the various economic agreements we have concluded. They are of great historical significance to the economic development of Poland. They also constitute a new link in a series of facts that, as Stalin, the great friend of Poland, said, "are sufficient to consolidate the friendship between the two countries." We fully understand the achievements of this trip, that is, we have taken a major step forward in economic development, strengthening the friendship between the two countries, and safeguarding the security of the two countries.

    对目前国际政治形势得到一致认识
    苏波签订五年换货协定
    【新华社陕北卅一日电】莫斯科讯：波兰总理西伦凯维兹、副总理哥穆尔卡，率领工商业部长明兹等政府代表团一行，于本月十六日抵莫斯科，与苏联部长会议主席斯大林、副主席兼外长莫洛托夫、对外贸易部长米高扬等经十余日会谈后，两国政府已就两国间重大政治经济问题及目前国际政治形势获致协议，并于廿六日签订一九四八年至五二年间换货协定，及苏联供给波兰工业装备之协定。前一协定规定两国在五年间换货总值将达十亿美元以上，苏联将供给波兰：铁、铬、铝、锰矿、砂、石油产品、棉花、石棉、汽车及拖拉机等。波兰将供给苏联：煤、焦煤、纺织品、钢制品、食糖、锌、火车厢及水泥等。至各项货品价格则规定双方按年根据国际价格事先妥为厘定。后一协定规定：苏联自一九四八年至五六年止，经常供应波兰以各种新式大冶金工厂、动力、化学、纺织等工厂之装备及重建城市与港口之装备。苏联为此特贷与波兰四亿五千万美元之信用贷款，此外苏联并同意在前已确定输往波兰之三十万吨谷物外，再另以信用贷款方式售与波兰谷物二十万吨，此项谷物在三个月内即可全部交清。两国代表亦曾就去年四月五日所订技术合作协定之实施情形及波兰对一九四八年德国在波兰财产对苏赔偿问题交换意见，并获得协议。斯大林在廿六日订约后，曾设宴为波兰代表团饯行，波兰代表团已于次日返波。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】莫斯科讯：波兰总理西伦凯维兹，于二十七日离苏前发表谈话，略称：此次访苏，使我们两国政府有机会对目前国际形势得到了完全一致的认识，也使我们惨遭战祸蹂躏国家复兴经济的方法，以及对于这些国家发展经济并保持其主权完整所应遵循的道路，得到了完全一致的认识。这些观点，已在我们缔结的诸项经济协定中全部体现。它们对于波兰经济发展具有极大历史意义。它们又构成了如波兰伟大友人斯大林所称：“足以巩固两国友谊的”一系列事实中的新环节。我们充分了解此行成就，即在经济发展、加强两国友谊与保障两国安全方面，已前进了一大步。
