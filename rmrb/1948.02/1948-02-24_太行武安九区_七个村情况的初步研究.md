　　Preliminary Study of the Situation in Seven Villages in the Ninth District of Wu'an, Taihang

　　The six villages of Zhao Zhuang, Tian Er Zhuang, He Dong, Qing Yan Si, Shi Er Zhuang, Shi Dong, and He Xi in the Ninth District of Wu'an, with the exception of Qing Yan Si, all began rent reduction and interest rate reduction after 1942, and filling in and making up the difference in 1946, only then did the poor peasants and hired laborers begin to obtain land. The villages are very close to each other (three to five *li*), and the past work was carried out under the same policy, the same steps, and the same style, so from the current perspective, they exhibit many common problems. However, due to the different depths of the work, the class relations and land distribution in each village are not completely the same, so there are also some different characteristics.

　　What common characteristics are displayed?

　　First, the general land has been largely leveled. Landless and land-poor peasants have obtained land after filling in and making up the difference according to the May 4th Directive; however, some land is insufficient, the quality is too poor, and they lack clothing and food. Among the sixteen poor and hired laborer households in Tian Er Zhuang, five are still in debt and eight lack food. Three households have not been allocated land at all, and others have too little good land. In He Xi Village, there are a total of thirty-nine poor and hired laborer households, of which eight lack housing, clothing, and food, and one lacks land. Among the poor and hired laborers in Zhao Zhuang, 10% have not been completely emancipated and lack clothing, food, and good land. In He Dong Village, poor and hired laborers who severely lack land still account for 20%. The general situation in each village is that although the quantity of land is largely leveled, the disparity in quality is very large. Each village has a situation of increasing the output of bad land and suppressing the output of good land. This is a method adopted by the village cadres to cover up their high output of good land. On the surface, the output seems to be filled in almost the same, but in reality, the difference is much greater, and the poor peasants and hired laborers urgently demand redistribution.

　　Second, the distribution of floating property is very unfair, village cadres are greedy and take more of the fruits of victory, they become emancipated excessively, the poor peasants and hired laborers have large deficits, and they urgently demand means of subsistence and means of production. None of the seven villages has a clear account of the fruits of victory; they are all muddled accounts. In He Xi Village, the hidden land and grain money of the landlords discovered in 1943 have not been accounted for to this day. The cadres have all divided the good houses and courtyards of the landlords, but there are still poor peasants with seven people living in a dilapidated house, covered by three broken quilts. The account of the fruits of victory from the spring of 1945 to the autumn of 1946 in Qing Yan Si has never been calculated. Last February, it was announced that all of it would be contributed to the cooperative on behalf of the masses. Land, houses, trees, livestock, etc., since the struggle, have all been sold at a price, but the accounts have never been announced. The floating property and clothing stored in the cooperatives of each village, as well as the over-occupied and embezzled by the cadres, is a very large amount, and the masses universally demand clearance. A good clearance of this account can solve some or most of the difficulties in the means of production and means of subsistence of the masses.

　　Third, the cadres' work style is administrative command, and the masses urgently demand democracy. Zhao Zhuang is the village with the most in-depth movement and relatively normal development of work among these villages, but there is no exception. The masses see the cadres as new stone slabs. They arbitrarily beat, scold, hang, bind, and fine the masses. In their opinion, this can only be considered "inappropriate" at most, and "self-criticism" is enough, but the masses hold grudges in their hearts and never forget it. In terms of the relationship between cadres and the masses, the cadres are a large faction, a "swarm." The poor peasants in Shi Dong Village say it is "ten-family democracy." Although the cadres are not entirely a mess internally, with both good and bad, and their opinions are not completely consistent, some cadres in each village have not over-occupied the fruits of victory and have not beaten or bound people, but because they have adopted a protective attitude towards those who have made mistakes, the masses view them as a group. Historically, whenever the issue of cadre-mass relations was resolved, the leadership ultimately supported the cadres. The masses believe that such "face washing" is "officials protecting each other," and they initially adopt an attitude of distrust towards the working comrades.

　　Fourth, the poor and hired laborer class has not been mobilized and remains an oppressed class. Although they have land today, and some have joined the Party, and some have become cadres, and seem to have "power," in fact, their emancipation was "bestowed" upon them, and therefore it is very incomplete. Only a very small number of them have obtained "power," and once they are on stage, they forget their roots. Those who are not in power can only be "guests." The Party in Shi Er Zhuang is manipulated by two bankrupt landlord Party members, and the village chief from a poor and hired laborer background is a "guest."

　　From the preliminary understanding of the above situations, it can be seen that the masses have three major urgent demands: "Implement democracy and transform cadres," "Clear accounts of the fruits of victory and distribute floating property," and "Draw from the fat to supplement the lean and thoroughly emancipate." Among these three demands, the demand for democracy is the most fundamental. Because the masses have realized from historical experience that it is impossible to achieve thorough emancipation without obtaining democratic rights.

　　Based on the materials from these villages, several types are initially proposed for research.

　　The first type is represented by Zhao Zhuang (including Shi Dong Village). The characteristics of this type of village are: the foundation of the Party is better. Among the thirty-nine Party members in Zhao Zhuang, twenty-four are poor and hired laborers. Before the anti-traitor liquidation, the mass movement was contracted by a few cadres. After the May 4th Directive, a group of activists was mobilized, numbering more than one hundred. The last blow to feudal forces was relatively thorough. There is such a group of masses in the village, so the work appears to be active on the surface, able to complete tasks, and everything is in order. When you first enter the village, you will feel that there is no problem. However, if you study carefully, although the foundation of the Party is good and the mistakes made by Party members are relatively small, the masses initially find it difficult to forgive the mistakes of cadres and Party members. They are above the masses and have similarly developed into a kind of dictatorial rule, administrative command, corruption, over-occupation of the fruits of victory, mutual cover-up... of bad work styles, so we must not be deceived by some superficial phenomena. We must support the demands of the masses and transform Party members and cadres without any wavering. The three major urgent demands of the masses mentioned earlier (emancipation, accounting, and democracy) must be realized one by one. But at the same time, it must be noted that the Party in Zhao Zhuang has been tempered, and Party members have a relatively good political awareness. If their mistakes can be corrected in front of the masses, a large part of them can still be good long-term workers for the people. A one-sided view that all Party members are bad and that all Party members are inferior to the masses must be opposed.

　　The second type is represented by He Xi and Tian Er Zhuang. From the perspective of the work foundation, the characteristics of this type of village are that several main old cadres are in power (mostly middle peasants), and the branch does not play a role. He Xi is governed by five major cadres, and Tian Er Zhuang is ruled by the Yang family. Their struggle against the landlords is generally resolute, but they also rule the masses very severely, developing into a small faction that is anti-people. Mutual cover-up is a characteristic after cadres with middle peasant components are in power. They have many concerns and are lenient. Some people do not have major mistakes themselves, but they act as two-faced good people between the people and the cadres. The family rule in Tian Er Zhuang has developed to the point where they can arbitrarily "throw the masses into the West Ditch" (beat to death) to intimidate the masses with this kind of terror. The masses in He Xi Village do not know that there is a Communist Party and a branch in their village. They only know that the cadres are powerful. They sometimes say angrily: "The cadres have replaced the landlords of the past." Some newly absorbed poor and hired laborer Party members in the branch often dare not say anything. These villages were not key villages in the past, the villages are small, the leadership does not often inspect, and the responsibility is often entrusted to a few active cadres, which is also one of the reasons for the formation of cadre autocracy. This time, during Party rectification, they often say: "If the superiors don't tell us to do it, we can't offend the masses." Therefore, they must be reviewed and identified by the masses, let them distinguish between right and wrong, merit and demerit, recognize their past mistakes, know their mistakes and correct them, and honestly bow their heads to the masses. Because the Party members in these villages are bad, the masses' understanding of the Party is mistaken. Therefore, during the movement, the masses must be made to recognize the Party and rely on the Party from their own personal experience in order to more fully help rectify the Party.

　　The third type of village is represented by Shi Er Zhuang and Qing Yan Si. The characteristics of this type of village are that the leadership has always been controlled by a few ruffians and bankrupt landlord elements, forming a set of the worst work styles for ruling the masses. Beating, fining, deducting, and detaining are the main weapons of these cadres. Waste, theft, rape, and other evils are committed. Shi Er Zhuang began to establish work in 1942 and was controlled by a ruffian element. Later, it was controlled by two bankrupt landlord elements. During the autumn movement last year, a poor and hired laborer was beaten to death under a false pretext. The emancipation of the masses is poor, and the conflict between cadres and the masses is sharp. When working personnel arrive in the village, before the masses have been mobilized, bad cadres try every means to manipulate and block. After the masses are mobilized, it is easy to develop revenge, and even be used by people who have personal grudges against the cadres. Shi Er Zhuang transferred the worst cadres to the district for reflection, leaving behind the combined mobilization of the masses to rectify the Party, preparing to resolve the issues of these bad elements after the movement comes to an end. Qing Yan Si openly exposed the obstruction of bad cadres to Party rectification. These methods have achieved relatively good results.

　　In addition to the above three types of villages, He Dong Village has some special circumstances—the village has little land and a large population (the relationship between cadres and the masses is not sharp). After drawing from the fat to supplement the lean and returning the fruits of victory, it still cannot solve the difficulties of 20% of the deficit households in terms of land and means of subsistence.

　　The above is only a preliminary study based on the work foundation, as a reference for studying the rural situation in the consolidation of the ranks. This is only an outline understanding. In the gradual deepening of the movement, further understanding must continue to be made.

### 太行武安九区　七个村情况的初步研究

　　太行武安九区
  　七个村情况的初步研究
    武安九区赵庄、田二庄、河东、青烟寺、史二庄、石洞、河西等六个村，除青烟寺外，都是在四二年以后，即开始进行减租减息，四六年填平补齐，贫雇才开始得到土地。村与村相距很近（三里到五里），过去的工作又是在一个方针、一个步骤、一个作风下进行的，因此从现在看，便表现出很多共同的问题。但又由于工作的深入程度不同，各个村的阶级关系、土地分配又不完全一样，因此便又有些不同的特点。
    表现出那些共同的特点呢？
    第一是一般的土地大体填平，无地少地农民从五四指示填平补齐后，取得土地；但均有一部分土地不够，质量太差，缺衣缺食。田二庄十六户贫雇，目前尚有五户欠债，八户缺吃。有三户根本未分得土地，其他人好地太少。河西村贫雇农共三十九户，其中有八户缺房缺衣缺食，有一户缺土地。赵庄贫雇农中有百分之十尚未彻底翻身，缺衣缺食，缺好地。河东村十分缺乏土地的贫雇还占百分之二十。各村普遍情况是土地数量虽大体填平，但质量上悬殊很大，各村都有提高坏地产量，压低好地产量的情况，这是村干部为了掩护自己得好地产量高，所采取的办法。表面上产量似乎填得差不多，但实际上则差得多，贫雇农迫切要求抽补。
    第二是浮财分配十分不公，村干部贪污多占果实，翻身过高，贫雇窟窿大，迫切要求生活资料与生产资料。七个村没有一个村的果实帐是清白的，都是一笔糊涂帐。河西村从四三年查出地主的黑地隐瞒的粮款，到现在没有算过帐，干部都分了地主的好房好院，还有贫农却是七口人住一间破房，盖三条破被。青烟寺四五年春天到四六年秋天的果实帐，从未算过，去年二月，才宣布全部代群众入合作社。斗争以来的土地、房屋、树木、牲口等均作价卖出，但帐目则从未宣布。各村合作社所存及干部多占和贪污的浮财、衣物是一个很大的数目，群众普遍要求清理。这笔帐清理得好，可解决一部分或大部分群众的生产资料与生活资料的困难。
    第三、干部作风行政命令，群众迫切要求民主。赵庄在这几个村中是运动较深入、工作发展较为正常的村庄，也没有例外。群众看干部是当作新石板来看的。他们对群众随意打、骂、吊、捆、罚，在他们觉得，这顶多只能算是“不应该”，“检讨检讨”就算了，群众则记恨在心，念念不忘。从干部对群众的关系上讲，干部是一个大宗派，“一窝蜂”。石洞村贫农说是“十家民主”。虽然干部内部亦并不完全是一团糟，有好有坏，意见并不完全一致，各村均有一些干部并未多占果实，并未打人捆人，但由于他们对犯错误的人采取的是包庇态度，因此群众对他们的看法是当作一个集团来看的。历史上每次解决干群问题时，领导上最后都是给干部撑了腰。群众认为这样的“洗脸擦黑”是“官官相卫”，现在对工作同志最初还采取不信任态度。
    第四、贫雇阶层并没有发动起来，仍然是受压迫阶层。虽然他们今天有了土地，而且有一部分入了党，还有的当了干部，似乎也有“权”了。其实，他们翻身是被“恩赐”的，因而也就很不彻底。他们之中只有很少数的得了“权”，上了台，就忘了本。没在掌权的，只能做“陪客”，史二庄的党就是在两个破落地主党员手中操纵着，贫雇出身的村长做“陪客”。
    从以上几种情况的初步了解中，可以看出，群众有三大迫切要求：“实行民主，改造干部”，“清算果实，分配浮财”，“抽肥补瘦，彻底翻身”，这三种要求中，民主要求又是最基本的。因为群众从历史的经验中，已认识到，不能求得民主权利，彻底翻身是不可能的。
    根据这几个村的材料，初步的提出几种类型来研究。
    第一种类型以赵庄作代表（包括石洞村），这类村的特点是：党的基础较好，赵庄三十九个党员中，廿四个是贫雇。反奸清算以前的群众运动是少数干部包办的，五四指示后，发动了一批积极层，人数有一百多，最后一次对封建势力的打击是比较彻底的。村里边有了这样一批群众，因此工作从表面上看是活跃的，能完成任务，一切都是次序井然，初一进村，会感到没啥问题。但如果仔细研究，党的基础虽好，党员犯的错误也比较小，但干部、党员的错误，群众最初很难原谅。他们在群众之上，同样的发展成为一种独断统治、行政命令、贪污腐化、多占果实、相互包庇……的恶劣作风，因此我们就不能被一些表面的现象所迷惑，必须支持群众要求，改造党员干部，不能有丝毫动摇。前边所提的群众的三大迫切要求（翻身、算帐、民主），均必须一一实现。但同时还必须注意，赵庄的党是经过锻炼了的，党员有着比较好的政治觉悟，如果他们的错误能在群众面前得到改正，他们当中很大一部分还是可以当人民的好长工。有一种片面的认为党员一切皆坏，一切党员不如群众的说法，是必须反对的。
    第二种类型以河西、田二庄为代表。从工作基础上看，这类村的特点是几个主要的老干部掌权（其中中农多），支部不起作用。河西是五大干部专政，田二庄是姓杨的一姓家族的统治。他们对地主的斗争一般是坚决的，但他们对群众也统治的很厉害，发展成为一个反人民的小宗派。相互包庇是中农成份干部掌权后的特点，他们顾虑多，讲情面，有些人自己的错误不大，但却在人民与干部中间，充当两面好人。田二庄的家庭统治，发展到可随意将群众“扔到西沟去”（捣死），用这种恐怖手段来威吓群众。河西村群众，根本不知道在他们村里就有共产党，就有支部，只知道干部厉害，他们有时气愤地说：“干部代替了过去的地主。”支部里有些新吸收的贫雇党员，经常不敢吭气。这类村过去不是基点村，村子较小，领导上不常检查，把责任经常委托给几个积极干部，也是形成干部独断专制的原因之一。这次整党，他们常常说：“上面不叫咱干，咱也得罪不了群众。”因此必须经过群众审查鉴定，让他们分清是非功过，认识自己过去的错误，知错改错，老老实实向群众低头。这些村由于党员坏，影响到群众对党的认识发生错觉，因此必须在运动中，使群众从自己的切身经验中，认识党依靠党以便更加充分的帮助整党。
    第三种类型村以史二庄、青烟寺为代表。这类村的特点是领导一贯被少数流氓、破落地主分子把持，形成一套最坏的统治群众的作风。打、罚、扣、押是这类干部的主要武器，浪费、偷窃、强奸等无恶不作。史二庄从四二年开始建立工作，就被一个流氓分子掌权，后来由两个破落地主分子掌权，在去年秋季运动中，曾借故打死一个贫雇。群众翻身较差，干群对立较尖锐，工作员一到村，在群众尚未发动起来之前，坏干部想尽各种办法操纵封锁。当群众发动起来之后，又很容易发展报复，甚至易被对干部有私恨的人利用。史二庄将最坏的干部调区反省，留下的结合发动群众整党，准备运动告一段落，再解决这些坏分子的问题。青烟寺公开揭发坏干部对整党的阻碍。这些办法都收到比较好的效果。
    除以上三种类型村外，河东村又有些特殊情况——该村地少人多，（干群关系不尖锐）经过抽补，退出果实，仍不能解决百分之二十的窟窿户的土地与生活资料的困难。
    以上仅系根据工作基础初步研究，作为整顿队伍中研究农村情况的参考，这还只是轮廓的了解，在运动逐步深入中，还必须继续再作了解。
