The original text states: The five-year Non-Aggression Pact was signed between the Soviet Union and the Republic of China in 1937. The validity of the pact was extended three times in 1942, 1944, and 1946, each time for two years according to Article 4. Since neither the Soviet Union nor China notified the other of its intention to terminate the pact six months before its expiration, its validity will automatically be extended for another two years according to the provisions of the pact.

　　中苏互不侵犯条约再自动延长两年
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日电讯；宣布中苏互不侵犯协定第四度自动延长两年，原文称：一九三七年苏联与中华民国间签订了为期五年的互不侵犯条约，该约时效曾于一九四二、一九四四及一九四六年延长三次，照第四条规定，每次延长两年。因为苏中两国都未在该约满期六个月前通知废除该约，照该约规定，其效力再自动延长两年。
