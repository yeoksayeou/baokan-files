The treaty stipulates that the two countries will cooperate militarily and diplomatically to counter aggression and have decided to fully consult on major international issues concerning the interests of both parties. The signing ceremony took place in the Kremlin, with Stalin personally attending the ceremony. After the signing, Molotov delivered a speech stating: "The Soviet-Romanian treaty is another strong bastion against new aggression and predatory imperialist plans. The two countries will use it to eliminate the possibility of Germany or other countries launching aggression again. At a time when war instigators in the imperialist camp are trying to establish political and military blocs to oppose democratic countries and prevent the peaceful and cooperative development of all countries, the signing of this treaty, which aims to guarantee peaceful cooperation between neighboring countries and ensure the peace and security of all countries, is of particular significance." Groza then delivered a speech, emphasizing: "The Romanian people are fully committed to consolidating their people's democratic system and are also determined to fully consolidate lasting world peace."
