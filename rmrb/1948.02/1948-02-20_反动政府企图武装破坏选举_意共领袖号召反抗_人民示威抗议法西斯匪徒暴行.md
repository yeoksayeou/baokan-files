    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Rome Dispatch: Italian Communist leader Togliatti, in a statement published in "Unità" on the 14th, declared: Scelba (reactionary Interior Minister) announced that 150,000 fully armed reactionary troops will be used to oppose anti-government parties in order to disrupt the election, create domestic panic, and an atmosphere of political tension. Togliatti emphasized: The imperialist forces supporting the De Gasperi government do not want the election at all, because they are afraid of the people's victory. Togliatti finally asserted: But the people need the election, and they will give any provocation from any quarter a just resistance. Nenni and other leaders of the People's Democratic Front also strongly criticized Scelba's reactionary measures.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Rome Dispatch: The Italian reactionary authorities instigated fascist thugs on the 9th to provoke the People's Democratic Front in San Ferdinando city, Puglia province (formerly mistranslated as San Frandino), resulting in a bloody tragedy. Many cities in Italy held rallies and demonstrations to express their angry protests. At a rally held in Bari, local trade union secretary Di Donato and representatives of various democratic groups spoke in support of the demands made by the Executive Committee of the People's Democratic Front to the reactionary government, namely, to severely punish the instigators and participants of this provocation and to disband the armed fascist forces. A 24-hour protest strike was held in Foggia province, followed by demonstrations and rallies by the people in many cities of the province. "Unità" condemned the United States for being responsible for this bloody incident. Furthermore: Women in Bologna recently marched and demonstrated in front of the county government to protest the county magistrate's anti-democratic actions. All factory and transportation workers in the city went on strike for two hours to protest the police's violence during the women's demonstration and held a protest rally in the city center. The nationwide seamen's strike, which began on the 4th, has ended victoriously, with the industrialists and the League of Shipyard Owners forced to accept the seamen's demands for wage increases.
