Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th: Comprehensive reports: Under the pressure of the Italian people, the Gasperi reactionary government was forced to announce on the 5th that the general election would be held on April 18th. Recently, two camps in Italy have been engaged in fierce struggles for the general election. After Gasperi co-opted the Republican Party and the Saragat Party in mid-December last year, giving them the position of Deputy Prime Minister, he vigorously promoted the "centrism" of his government in order to deceive public opinion; at the same time, he further sold himself to the United States. With the full support of the American master, the reactionary government is prepared to use force to suppress the upcoming general election. According to TASS: The Gasperi government has ordered the conscription of 20,000 former fascist soldiers to join the "security team" for use during the election. Three hundred American armored vehicles have entered Rome to equip these "security teams." At the same time, the Italian cabinet has passed a bill abolishing the "military organization" law and sentencing the leaders of "military organizations for political purposes" to two to ten years of imprisonment. This reactionary measure has aroused widespread protests from Italian democrats and public opinion. L'Unità pointed out that this decree is a provocative act against guerrillas and other democratic organizations, and its purpose is to create an extremely tense atmosphere during the election. Longo, commander of the Garibaldi Guerrilla Brigade, telegraphed the Italian President, protesting this anti-people provocative action, and suggested that a meeting of all the leaders of the former "Liberation Volunteer Corps" be held to discuss the situation caused by the Gasperi government's desire to "destroy the glorious tradition of the guerrilla movement." Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti strongly condemned this as "Gasperi's and the Christian Democratic Party's election conspiracy."

    反动政府操纵大选向人民挑衅
    意民主人士广泛抗议
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：在意人民的压力下，加斯贝利反动政府被迫于五日宣布：大选将于四月十八日举行。最近，意国内两个阵营正为大选展开了激烈的斗争。加斯贝利在去年十二月中旬拉拢共和党及萨拉盖特党给予副总理职位后，即大事宣传其政府的“中间性”，借以欺骗舆论；同时又进一步向美国卖身投靠。在美国主子全力支持下，反动政府已准备在即将到来的大选中使用武力弹压。据塔斯社讯：加斯贝利政府已命令征集二万前法西斯士兵加入“保安队”，供选举期间之用。美军三百辆装甲车已开入罗马装备这些“保安队”。同时，意内阁已通过废除“军事组织”法案及对“以政治为目的之军事组织”的领袖判处二年至十年徒行。这一反动措施已引起意民主人士及舆论的广泛抗议。团结报指出：这个法令是对游击队及其它民主组织的挑衅行为，其目的在于在选举时造成极紧张气氛。加黎波的游击纵队司令隆哥致电意总统，抗议这种反人民的挑衅行动，并建议由一切前“解放志愿兵团”的领袖集会，以讨论因加斯贝利政府欲“破坏游击队运动的光荣传统”而引起的局势。意共总书记托格里亚蒂力斥这是“加斯贝利与基督教民主党的选举阴谋。”
