　　【Our News】Recently, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army operating near Anyang launched a successful mopping-up operation against the reactionary secret societies organized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Wulingji area east of Caiyuan. On the 19th, they successively captured the villages of Wulingji, Dasongtun, Xiaosongtun, Tunzhuang, Xiaoguoji, and Bei Wuling, liberating more than 300 secret society armed personnel and seizing more than 140 long and short guns. On the 20th, they cleared more than 20 villages southeast of Caiyuan, and by the 22nd, they had captured more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek bandit local defense corps and secret society armed personnel, seizing 2 light machine guns, 60 rifles, and more than 100 pistols. With the exception of a small number of special agents and despotic elements, the majority have been released. These secret societies were organized by Si Bingnan and Wang Hengmi, local bullies from Anyang and Tangyin. Most of those who joined the reactionary secret societies were either forced or misled by superstition, so after being captured, as long as they expressed remorse and no longer harmed the people, our army released them.

After the victory, on the 13th, they once again penetrated deep behind enemy lines, crossing the railway and the Dan River to attack Dasongzhuang, only eight miles from Xinxiang City. After an hour of fierce fighting, they broke into the third team headquarters of the enemy puppet Muyexiang, killing the enemy squad leader Tong Defu and two local militiamen, and capturing the team leader Fu Junsheng and 25 others (including 6 squad leaders), eliminating a total of 28 enemies and seizing 22 rifles.
