    Removing the Enemy's Satellite Stronghold South of Shenyang
    We Capture Liaoyang City and Annihilate Nearly Two Divisions of Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, urgent telegram, 7th] Since the Northeast People's Liberation Army's Winter Offensive, with four victories in four battles, at 15:30 on the 6th, we captured Liaoyang City, an important satellite stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits 120 li south of Shenyang. We completely annihilated the enemy's New 5th Army's Provisional 54th Division, the 52nd Army's Transportation Regiment, a Traffic Police Corps, and the garrison personnel of the enemy's New 6th Army, New 5th Army, and 52nd Army stationed in the city. The results of the battle are being tallied. Our army launched a general offensive at 7:00 AM, broke into the city in just one hour and fifteen minutes, and after eight and a half hours, completely resolved the battle, annihilating all the defending enemies in the city, with none escaping. By this point, the enemy's New 5th Army, formed before the start of our Winter Offensive, was completely annihilated in just one month after the 195th and 43rd Divisions were wiped out. The bandit chieftains Chen and Wei did not dare to send a single soldier to reinforce them during this campaign. Liaoyang is the eleventh city we have recovered during the Winter Offensive.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th] Encouraged by the victory of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's Winter Offensive, peasant emancipation movements are sweeping across Kaiyuan, Tieling, Faku, Xinmin, Heishan, Liaozhong, and other areas surrounding Shenyang. As soon as the People's Liberation Army arrives, the peasants accuse the landlords and local bullies of colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu bandits to oppress the peasants, demanding the army's support. In just ten days of marching through the area, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army helped poor peasants and hired laborers distribute over 3 million jin of grain, over 300 head of livestock, 84,226 zhang of cloth, and over 29,000 cotton-padded and unlined garments from the landlords. When the People's Liberation Army arrived at the ancient castle of Kaiyuan, the peasants automatically arrested the big landlord nicknamed "Ten Thousand Hates," organized a people's court for a public trial, and automatically distributed grain and movable property. The peasants in Yangbao Village also automatically arrested the landlord Fu Quanlin, distributing grain and movable property worth 10 million yuan. In Daxi Huang Village of Heishan, only ten-odd li from the Beining Railway, as soon as the poor peasants, women, and children saw the People's Liberation Army arriving in the village, they rushed into the home of the big bully Sun Xianzhong to settle accounts with him. The poor and hired laborers in the village promoted mutual aid and distributed the fruits to a part of Kaoshan Village nearby. When the People's Liberation Army arrived at Banlamen Village in the county, the poor peasant Tan Cheng knelt at the entrance of the village, lamenting and recounting the crime of the bully Jiang Silin who kicked his daughter to death. With the support of the troops, the poor and hired laborers in the village arrested Jiang Silin. Emancipated peasants are automatically organizing sleighs to support the front lines with the army. In Yanqianhu Village of Faku and other places, the peasants even armed themselves with ten earthen cannons seized from the landlords. The peasants in the areas that have not yet been liberated are eagerly awaiting the early arrival of the People's Liberation Army.

    【新华社东北七日急电】东北解放军冬季攻势以来四战四捷，于六日十五时半攻克沈阳以南一百二十里之蒋匪重要卫星据点辽阳城，全歼敌新五军暂五十四师、五十二军输送团、一个交警总队及留驻该城之敌新六军、新五军、五十二军三部留守人员，战果正清查中。我军于清晨七时发起总攻，仅一小时零十五分钟即突入城内，共历八个半钟头，全部解决战斗，尽歼守敌于城内，无一漏网。至此敌在我冬季攻势开始前组成之新五军，于一九五师、四十三师被歼后，仅一个月即全军覆没。陈、卫匪首在此次战役中，迄无一兵一卒敢来应援。按辽阳为我冬季攻势中收复之第十一座城市。
    【新华社东北七日电】在东北解放军冬季攻势胜利的鼓舞下，沈阳外围的开原、铁岭、法库、新民、黑山、辽中等地，到处掀起农民的翻身运动。解放军一到，农民就控告地主、恶霸勾结蒋、胡匪压迫农民的暴行，要求军队撑腰。仅解放军某部在该地区行军的十天中，就帮助贫雇农分地主粮三百余万斤、牲口三百余头、布八百四二六丈、棉衣、单衣二万九千余件，还有许多浮财。开原古城堡农民当解放军到时就自动逮捕了绰号“万人恨”的大地主，组织人民法庭公审，并自动分粮分浮。杨堡屯农民也自动逮捕了地主傅泉林，分粮分浮价值千万元。距北宁铁路只有十多里的黑山大西荒村，贫雇农民、妇女、儿童一见解放军到村就拥入大恶霸孙咸忠家，向他清算。该村贫雇发扬友爱，并把果实分给附近靠山屯一部。当解放军到达该县半拉门屯时，贫农谭成就在屯口喊冤，痛诉恶霸蒋思林踢死他女儿的罪行。在部队撑腰下，该屯贫雇把蒋思林逮捕起来。翻身农民多自动组织爬犁随军支前。法库严千户屯等地农民并把收缴地主的土炮十门武装了自己。尚未解放地区农民都热盼解放军早日到临。
