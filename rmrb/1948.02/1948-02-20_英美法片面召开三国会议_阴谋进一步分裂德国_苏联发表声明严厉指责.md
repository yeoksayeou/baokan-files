    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The American, British, and French governments have decided to convene a separate tripartite conference in London on the 19th to discuss specific steps to further divide Germany. Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin, on behalf of the Soviet government, presented a solemn statement to British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 13th, urging the British government to pay attention. The statement claimed that the general policy towards Germany and the issue of West Germany, which will be reviewed at the tripartite conference, fall within the jurisdiction of all occupying powers in Germany and involve other European countries, therefore unilateral action should not be taken. The statement strongly condemned the convening of such a conference as a violation of the Potsdam Agreement and the agreement of the German Control Council. The statement solemnly pointed out that the Soviet government would not recognize any decisions passed at such a conference as legal. Soviet ambassadors to Paris and Washington also issued similar statements.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Berlin dispatch: The so-called "Charter" promulgated on the 6th in the joint occupation zones of West Germany has aroused strong opposition from all parties. Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander of the Soviet occupation forces, warned the commanders of the British and American forces at the Allied Control Council on the 11th, stating that they were dividing Germany, thereby destroying the German control organs, and that the British and American authorities would be fully responsible for all consequences arising therefrom. The leading organ of the West German Communist Party recently issued a statement, firmly stating: "The German Communist Party will never recognize the West German separatist government in Frankfurt." The statement pointed out: The German people will establish an all-German Consultative Committee as soon as possible to organize a German central government and prepare for the election of a people's congress to hold a referendum on the issue of German unification. The Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party in the Soviet zone, as well as the chairmen of the states in the zone, fiercely criticized the "Joint Zone Charter" as threatening German unification and decided to participate in the second German People's Congress to be held on March 17.
