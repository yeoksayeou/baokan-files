Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: The Katayama Cabinet of the right wing of the Japanese Socialist Party collapsed on the 10th. The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, "Akahata," commented that the facts have proven that the Katayama Cabinet not only cannot cope with the current domestic crisis, but has also deepened it. The people's dissatisfaction and anger are growing, which is the real reason for the fall of the Katayama Cabinet. "Akahata" also said that the Communist Party firmly advocates the establishment of a united democratic front that can represent the interests of 95% of the people (workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, small and medium-sized manufacturers, etc.). The Communist Party, along with the entire country, demands the dissolution of the parliament and the holding of new general elections in order to listen to public opinion. The newspaper concluded that the Communist Party will be with the people of the whole country, and will spare no effort to unite the national democratic forces and establish a people's democratic front government that can protect the interests of the working people.
    At the same time, Katsumi Kanasaki, chairman of the Japan's largest trade union, the Industrial Union Federation (a member of the Japanese Communist Party), also declared: "We strongly demand that the cabinet be based on the working class, and believe that it is necessary to hold a general election."

    日本片山内阁倒台
    日共要求建立民主战线政府
    【新华社陕北十六日电】东京讯：日本社会党右翼片山内阁，已于十日倒台。日共机关报赤旗报顷评称：事实已证明：该党内阁不仅不能应付目前的国内危机，而且加深了危机。人民的不满和愤怒日益增长，这就是片山内阁垮台的真正原因。赤旗报并说：共产党坚决主张建立可以代表百分之九十五人民（工人、农民、小资产阶级、中小制造家等）利益的联合民主战线。共产党和全国一道，要求解散议会，举行新的普选，以便听取民意。该报结论说：共产党将和全国人民在一起，不遗余力的力求团结全国民主力量，设立能保护劳动人民利益的人民民主战线政府。
    与此同时，日本最大工会产业组合联合会主席听涛克已（日共党员）也宣称：“我们强烈要求内阁以工人阶级为基础，并认为有进行大选的必要”。
