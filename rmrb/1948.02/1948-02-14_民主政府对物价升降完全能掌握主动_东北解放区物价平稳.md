    Democratic Government Can Fully Control Price Fluctuations
    Stable Prices in the Northeast Liberated Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th] Prices in the Northeast Liberated Areas are generally stable, and the democratic government can fully control price fluctuations. In January, in order to reduce the price scissors between agricultural and industrial products, the government proactively increased the price of major food items such as sorghum rice and soybeans by 8 percent. The price of rice, on the other hand, fell by 8 percent. Cotton yarn and cloth prices fell by about 30 percent, while prices for daily necessities, fuel, and gold remained unchanged. In contrast, prices in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are soaring. In January, rice in Changchun cost 2,500 yuan per pound, coal 250,000 yuan per ton, rice in Shenyang cost 5,000 yuan per pound, and gold cost 2.22 million yuan per tael, on average exceeding prices in the Liberated Areas by three to five times.
