    The "Soviet" translated into Chinese means "People's Representative Assembly." It is the form of government in the Soviet Union and the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union (unlike bourgeois parliaments, the Soviet is not only a legislative body, but the Presidium of the Soviet is also the highest administrative organ of the state). Based on the principle of protecting the complete equality and full freedom of all nationalities and races, the federal and all member republics and autonomous republics have their own Supreme Soviets. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is composed of two chambers: the Union Council and the National Council. The Chairman of the Union Council is Zhdanov, and the Chairman of the National Council is Kuznetsov. The representatives of these two chambers total one thousand one hundred and forty-three. According to the Soviet Constitution, the two chambers hold annual meetings twice a year, convened by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet holds all state military, political, legislative, economic powers, and represents the country externally. Its specific powers, as stipulated by the Soviet Constitution, number twenty-three. The main ones are: approving all legislation, budgets, final accounts, foreign treaties, handling declarations of war and peace, accepting new republics into the Soviet Union, organizing defense forces to defend the country, issuing amnesties, etc. In short, the Supreme Soviet is the highest organ of power in the Soviet Union.
    During the recess of the Supreme Soviet, its work is represented by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. This Presidium consists of thirty-seven people: one chairman, eleven vice-chairmen, one secretary, and twenty-four members. The Presidium is elected at a joint meeting of the two chambers from among the representatives of the two chambers, in accordance with Article 48 of the Soviet Constitution.

    最高苏维埃
    “苏维埃”译成中文就是“人民代表会议”的意思，是苏联的政权形式，是苏联国家的最高权力机关（和资产阶级议会所不同的是苏维埃不单是立法机关，而且苏维埃主席团也是国家的最高行政机关）。在保护各民族与种族完全平等及充分自由的原则下，联邦和各加盟共和国与自治共和国，都有各自的最高苏维埃。苏联最高苏维埃是由两院构成的，一个叫联盟院，一个叫民族院。联盟院主席是日丹诺夫，民族院主席是库茨涅佐夫。这两院的代表共有一千一百四十三人。按苏联宪法规定，两院每年举行年会两次，由最高主席团召集。最高苏维埃掌握国家一切军、政、立、法、经济大权，对外代表国家。它的具体大权，按苏联宪法规定，有二十三种。主要的是：批准一切立法、预算、决算，对外条约，处理宣战、媾和，接受新共和国加入苏联、组织国防力量保卫国家、颁布大赦等。总之，最高苏维埃就是苏联的最高权力机关。
    最高苏维埃休会期间，它的工作由最高苏维埃主席团代表它做。这个主席团由三十七个人组成。主席一人，副主席十一人，秘书一人，委员二十四人。主席团的产生，是根据苏联宪法第四十八条，举行两院联席会议，在两院代表中推选的。
