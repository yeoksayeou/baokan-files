    Zhao Village Paper Mill Revises Wages
    Labor and Management Both Benefit, Promoting Production
    [Qinyang News] In July of last year, the masses in Zhao Village, Qinyang, established a paper mill with a total capital of over 6.3 million (through public shareholding). At that time, the workers' wages were set at 200 yuan per day, which was genuinely insufficient. The workers raised the issue of family financial difficulties and requested a profit sharing arrangement of 60% for the capital and 40% for the workers, but this did not materialize. In December, they again requested a profit sharing arrangement of 70% for the capital and 30% for the workers, with the factory providing meals and the workers not receiving travel allowances. Currently, the workers have achieved this goal, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Everyone has established production plans. Previously, a ream of paper weighed 2.4 catties. Now, each ream weighs 2 catties, saving 0.4 catties of raw materials per ream. With a daily output of 78 reams, 19.5 catties of raw materials can be saved, totaling 585 catties per month, worth 187,200 yuan. With the increased enthusiasm of the workers, one vat can produce 10 more reams of paper per month. With thirteen vats, 130 more reams of paper can be produced per month, worth 416,000 yuan, resulting in a total increase in profit of 600,3200 yuan.

    赵寨纸厂改订工资
    劳资两利搞生产
    【沁阳消息】沁阳赵寨村群众在去年七月间，开造纸厂一所，共有六百三十多万资金（是群众入股）。当时规定工人工资每天二百元，实在有点顾不住。工人提出家庭生活困难，要求本六人四分红，没有结果。十二月又要求本七人三分红，工厂管吃，工人不支差。现下工人已达到这个目的，生产情绪更高起来。大家都订出生产计划，以前一刀纸二斤四两重，现每刀重二斤，一刀纸就省原料四两。每天出七十八刀，能省原料十九斤半，一月能省五百八十五斤，值十八万七千二百元。工人生产情绪高了，一个池子每月能多出十刀纸，十三个池子，一月能多出一百三十刀纸，值洋四十一万六千元，共能多赚六十万零三千二百元。
