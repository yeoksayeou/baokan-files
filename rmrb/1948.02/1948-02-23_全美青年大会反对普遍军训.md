　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—Washington Dispatch: The All-America Youth Conference against universal military training was held here on the 15th and 16th. The participating representatives included approximately 1,500 young people from 19 states in the United States, representing students, veterans, religious groups, political groups, and trade unions. Wallace sent a congratulatory telegram. The conference resolved to continue strengthening the movement against universal military training until the plan is abolished. It severely condemned the universal military training plan as a serious threat to national security and world peace, and demanded that the billions of dollars wasted on this plan be used to improve the living conditions of American youth. The resolution also criticized the Truman administration's foreign policy and urged the rebuilding of friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Simultaneously with the conference, a group of prominent American educators and pastors sent a letter to House Rules Committee Chairman Allen, stating that more than 100 national agricultural, labor, church, and educational groups oppose universal military training.
　　The conference organizers announced that an anti-military training demonstration march will soon be held in Washington, and many youth groups are uniting forces to carry out nationwide actions to oppose military training. Even conservative observers must admit that American youth, especially students, currently harbor a strong tendency to oppose another war and oppose "thought control" militaristic education. According to TASS, the "Democratic Youth League" and the "American Progressive Youth Citizens Association" are at the forefront of the anti-military training struggle.

　　全美青年大会反对普遍军训
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】华盛顿讯：反对普遍军训的全美青年大会，已于十五、十六两日在此召开。与会代表包括美国十九个州的学生、退伍军人、宗教团体、政治团体、职工会等青年代表约一千五百人之众。华莱士专电致贺。大会决议继续加强反对普遍军训运动，直至该计划废除为止。严厉谴责普遍军训计划是对国家安全及世界和平的严重威胁，要求把浪费于这个计划的数十亿美元，用于改善美国青年的生活条件。决议中并抨斥杜鲁门政府的外交政策，敦促重建美苏友好关系。与大会同时，美国一批著名教育家及牧师亦致函众院程序委员会主席埃伦称：全国一百多个农业、劳工、教会及教育团体，都反对普遍军训。
    大会筹备人曾宣布：即将在华盛顿举行反军训示威游行，许多青年团体为了反对军训，正团结力量进行全国性的行动。至于保守的观察家也不得不承认：美国青年，尤其是学生，目前怀着强烈反对再一次战争的倾向，并反对"思想控制"的军国主义教育。据塔斯社讯：目前站在反军训斗争最前列的，是"民主青年社"和"美国进步青年公民协会"。
