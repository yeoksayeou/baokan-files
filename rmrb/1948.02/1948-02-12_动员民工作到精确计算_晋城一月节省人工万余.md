    Mobilizing Civilian Labor to Achieve Precise Calculation:
    Jincheng Saves Over Ten Thousand Labor Days in One Month
    [Taiyue News] In the work of mobilizing civilian labor in January, Jincheng County Government saved a total of 13,614 labor days because it achieved precise calculation. Their saving methods were: (1) In each allocation of civilian labor, the total weight of all items to be transported was precisely calculated, and then the number of civilian laborers to be used was calculated based on the general labor burden (generally not exceeding fifty catties). For example, a certain unit needed to allocate 400 civilian laborers to transport single military uniforms from a certain place to a certain place. After precise calculation, 144 civilian laborers were saved, which could save 390 labor days calculated on a daily basis (one labor day is calculated as 60 li per day). (2) Each time mobilizing civilian labor for transportation, in order to implement the "bring-back" policy, before the civilian laborers started, they first contacted the relevant transportation departments to find out if they had anything to transport, and asked the quantity, from where to where, so that the civilian laborers who were traveling empty could bring back or take along goods on their return or departure. This also saved a large number of labor days; however, it must be noted that the weight transported by the civilian laborers who are also carrying goods should not be the same as the weight transported by the civilian laborers who are only transporting goods out. The physical condition and energy of the civilian laborers must be taken into consideration, and the weight of the goods carried along must be lighter.

    动员民工作到精确计算
    晋城一月节省人工万余
    【太岳消息】晋城县府在一月份动员民工工作中，因为作到精确计算，节省了民力共计一万三千六百一十四个工。他们节省的办法是：（一）在每一次拨派民工时，精确计算了全部所运东西的重量，然后再根据一般劳力负担情况（一般不超过五十斤），算出应该使用的民力数。如某部由某地往某地运单军衣要拨四百个民工，精确计算后，节省了一百四十四个民工，按日工计算，可省三百九十个日工（每日以六十里算一工）。（二）每次动员民力运输，为了实行捎差，在民工没动身起运前，先就和有关各运输部门取得连系，了解他们是不是有要运输的东西，并问清有多少数目，从哪里起到哪里去，好让空走的民工返回或出发时捎去、或捎回，这样节省民力数目也很大；但必须注意到捎运东西的民工，不能和只运出的民工运的重量一样，要照顾到民工的身体和精力，捎运的重量一定要轻一些。
