Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Despite Truman's calls for aid to Chiang Kai-shek, prices in Shanghai continue to soar. According to news agency reports, although the 27 million USD in grain provided by the U.S. under the guise of "relief" has been successively shipped to Shanghai, and Truman submitted a 570 million USD aid-to-Chiang Kai-shek bill to the U.S. Congress on the 18th, with the U.S. State Department's detailed aid plan announced on the 20th including 225,000 tons of wheat and 450,000 tons of rice, Shanghai rice, U.S. dollars, and gold still reached all-time highs after the 18th. On the 20th, Shanghai rice rose to 2.2 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency per dan (unit of weight), and on the 21st, it rose again to 2.4 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency in a single day, an increase of 33% compared to two weeks prior near the Lunar New Year. The black market exchange rate for U.S. dollars reached 225,000 in Chiang Kai-shek currency on the 20th, and the upward trend became even more frenzied on the 23rd, "with one U.S. dollar quoted at around 230,000 in the morning, rising every hour thereafter, reaching 270,000 by dusk" (Reuters), an increase of 80% compared to two weeks prior. Gold reached 17 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency per tael, and Chinese and foreign stocks all rose, with prices of all goods exceeding the peak of the first price storm this year and marching forward rapidly. Reuters pointed out that the soaring prices were due to the disastrous defeats of Chiang's troops in the Northeast and "the people's belief that no American loans could stop inflation." General observers have also pointed out that this wave of price increases has proven that Chiang Kai-shek's economic crisis is extremely profound and cannot be salvaged by any U.S. aid.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Shandong News: More than half of the businesses in Yantai have closed down due to Chiang Kai-shek's extortion. From October to December of last year alone, Chiang Kai-shek extorted 3.9 billion in Chiang Kai-shek currency in so-called "self-defense expenses," and "business tax" has been levied seven times. In the most recent instance, large businesses were extorted as much as 100 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency, and small businesses had to hand over 10 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency. During the Gregorian New Year, Chiang Kai-shek forced businesses to provide 20 fat pigs and 15,000 kilograms of Chinese cabbage to comfort Chiang's troops. Chiang Kai-shek also forcibly purchased pork at 4,000 in Chiang Kai-shek currency per jin, while the market price was 50,000 in Chiang Kai-shek currency per jin. Since the Chiang Kai-shek gang occupied the Yantai market, more than 2,700 businesses have been forced to close, accounting for more than half of the original businesses. Even well-known flour factories such as Tianchengh和, 福聚, and 福兴和 have successively closed down. The lives of ordinary people are in desperate straits. Prostitutes who had been educated by the democratic government and turned to legitimate professions are now back on the streets in large numbers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: According to Chiang Kai-shek's newspapers: Chiang Kai-shek is shipping soybeans seized from the Northeast to Japan. In January, Chiang Kai-shek's delegation to Japan officially signed a contract to ship 20,000 tons of soybeans to Japan. Another contract for 30,000 tons is also being negotiated. Prior to the formal signing of the contract, more than 10,000 tons of soybeans had already been shipped to Japan.

In addition: Chiang Kai-shek is also planning to expand trade with South Korea under U.S. occupation. Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Economic Affairs is discussing methods with relevant agencies. Chiang-Korean trade began in June of last year.

　　美帝援蒋声中上海物价猛涨
  　蒋匪经济危机没法挽救
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】在杜鲁门援蒋声中，上海物价仍猛烈上涨。据各通讯社消息：美帝以“救济”名义援蒋之二千七百万美元粮食虽已陆续运沪，杜鲁门十八日亦已向美国会提出五亿七千万美元援蒋咨文，二十日美国务院发表之援蒋方案详细节目中包括二十二万五千吨小麦与四十五万吨大米，但十八日之后上海大米与美钞黄金，仍涨达有史以来之最高峰。二十日上海大米每担涨到蒋币二百二十万元，二十一日一日间又升为二百四十万元，较二周前临近旧历年关时涨了百分之三十三。美钞黑市二十日已涨达二十二万五千，二十三日涨势更疯狂，“当日晨美钞一元喊价二十三万元左右，此后每小时都有上升，到黄昏时已达二十七万元”（路透社），较二周前涨了百分之八十。黄金每两已达蒋币一千七百万，中外股票无不上涨，百物价格也超过今年第一次物价风暴高峰，在大步迈进中。路透社曾指出：物价狂涨原因为蒋军在东北惨败与“人民认为任何美国贷款都不可能制止通货膨胀”；一般观察家也均指出，此次涨风，已证明蒋匪经济危机极度深刻，决非任何美帝援助所能挽救。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】山东讯：烟台商业在蒋匪勒索下已倒闭过半。去年仅十月到十二月蒋匪即勒索所谓“自卫经费”蒋币三十九亿元，“营业税”已征收七次，最近一次，大商号竟有被勒索一亿元者，小商号亦须交出一千万元。阳历年关时，蒋匪又迫令各商号以肥猪二十口、大白菜一万五千斤慰劳蒋匪军，蒋匪并以四千元强买市价五万元一斤的猪肉。自蒋匪帮侵占烟市至目前止，商号被迫停业者已有二千七百余家，占原有商号半数以上，即著名之天成和、福聚、福兴和等面粉工厂亦相继关门停业。一般人民生活均陷于绝境。过去经民主政府教育转入帮助正当职业的妓女现又大批踯躅街头。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据蒋区报纸载：蒋匪以自东北掠得之大豆输日。一月间蒋匪驻日代表团与日政府正式签订二万吨大豆输日合同。另一批三万吨之合同亦在商订中。在合同正式签订前，输日之大豆已逾一万吨。
    另悉：蒋匪亦筹谋与美帝占领下之南韩扩大贸易，蒋匪经济部正与各有关机关研议办法中，按蒋韩贸易系于去年六月开始。
