    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Singapore - The people of Malaya have risen up in opposition to Britain's establishment of the Malayan Union and the implementation of a new constitutional system, believing it to be a new shackle for British imperialism to control Malaya. When the Malayan Union was formally established on the first of this month, and Sir Gent took office as the British High Commissioner to the new Malayan Union in Kuala Lumpur that morning, Singapore erupted in a protest strike by 30,000 workers. The offices of Malayan left-wing political parties all flew flags at half-mast in mourning. The Malayan Democratic Union headquarters also held a mass meeting, exposing the British political conspiracy to establish the Malayan Union, aimed at strengthening the policy of division among all ethnic groups, especially the Chinese, through collusion with the reactionary Malay states. This would unswervingly maintain the British imperialist enslavement rule in Malaya. The meeting sent a telegram to the British government in London, demanding the immediate abolition of the new constitution. Under the call of the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions, British public bus drivers, government employees, dock workers, mechanics, and coal miners are now all involved in the strike wave. Prior to this, the Pan-Malayan Council of Joint Action, with 440,000 members, had joined the Malayan National United Front to form a standing committee, establishing a leadership organization in Kuala Lumpur to launch a movement against the Malayan Union Constitution, drafting a draft "People's Charter," and announcing a boycott of the Malayan Union Council on the 19th of last month. The British Malayan Union plan was officially published in a blue book at the end of 1946. The main reactionary contents of the Malayan Union plan and the new constitution are: (1) Replacing the Malayan Union with the Malayan Federation, with each state retaining its original privileges. (2) Separating Singapore from the Malayan Federation, making it a separate administrative region under the direct rule of the British government. (3) The Federation is controlled by a Supreme Commissioner appointed by the United Kingdom, who holds administrative and legislative power and may appoint British officials without citizenship as members of the Legislative Council. All members of the Legislative Council are appointed by the Commissioner. (4) Regarding the issue of citizenship, the regulations stipulate: Those who have resided in the area for fifteen years and whose parents were both born in the state; those who were not born in the Malayan Federation must apply for approval from the Federation's Senior Commissioner before they can obtain citizenship. (5) Regarding the number of members of the Federal Legislative Council, it is stipulated that there will be a total of 75, of which British official members account for 25.

    反对英帝制造“马来亚联邦”
    新加坡爆发大罢工
    马来亚民主阵线总部举行群众大会
    【新华社陕北六日电】新加坡讯：马来亚人民群起反对英国成立马来亚联邦及实施新宪制。认为这是英帝国主义控制马来亚的新枷锁。当本月一日马来亚联邦宣告成立、金德爵士是日晨在吉隆坡正式就任英驻新马来亚联邦高级专员时，新加坡爆发了三万名工人的抗议大罢工。马来亚左翼政党之办公处均下半旗致哀。马来亚民主阵线总部亦举行群众大会，揭露英国成立马来亚联邦之政治阴谋，旨在通过与马来亚反动土邦的勾结，加强对各民族特别是对华侨的分化政策。以原封不动地维护英帝国主义在马来亚的奴役统治。大会通电伦敦英政府，要求立即废止新宪法。在新加坡总工会号召下，英商公共汽车司机工人、政府公务员、码头工人、机工及煤矿工人，现均卷入罢工浪潮。在此以前，拥有四十四万会员的泛马来亚政团联合行动委员会，曾联合马来亚民族统一战线，组成常务委员会，在吉隆坡设立领导机构，发起反马来亚联邦宪法运动，起草“人民宪章”草案，并于上月十九日宣布抵制马来亚联邦议会。按英国之马来亚联邦计划于一九四六年年底正式以蓝皮书公布。马来亚联邦计划及新宪法之主要反动内容为：（一）以马来亚联邦代替马来亚联盟，各土邦得保持其原有特权。（二）新加坡与马来亚联邦分离，单独成为一行政区，归英政府直接统治。（三）由英国任命最高专员控制联邦，掌握行政、立法大权；并可指派无公民权之英籍官吏任立法会议议员。而所有立法会议议员均由专员指定。（四）关于公民权问题规定：须在该地居住十五年及父母均系出生于该邦，其非出生于马来亚联邦者，须申请联邦高级专员核准，方能取得公民资格。（五）关于联邦立法会议议员名额，规定共七十五名，而其中英官吏议员却占二十五名。
