　　“Forgetting the Pain Once the Sore Heals”
  　Cui Ziyu Reflects on the Ideology of Forgetting One's Roots
    (A poor peasant from Huixian County. He joined the Party in 1944 and immediately began working. He is currently the chairman of the Rescue Association in X district of Xinxiang.)

    As far as I can remember, my family relied on two mattocks and a hoe to reclaim wasteland and rent land for a living. I herded cattle at ten and lived as a hired hand at fifteen. Later, I carried loads to make a living. My grandfather and father were both hired hands all their lives, earning nothing. The whole family couldn't get enough to eat or wear. However, my class consciousness was very poor. In 1944, when rent reduction was implemented, I felt that I had offended the landlords and was a little worried. I wanted to find someone to rely on, so I joined the Party. When I first started working, I was very enthusiastic, but later I slowly forgot about my class brothers and started planning for myself. After being assigned to work in Xinxiang, I saw that other people dressed better and were wealthier than me, so I used the money from confiscating ammunition for rewards to buy a blanket. I wanted to equip myself in all aspects. Because I was eager to solve the marriage problem, I even shielded a landlord woman.

    In my work, administrative orders were very severe. I only blindly worked alone, without motivating everyone. When I worked in Liuzan City, it was said to be a bunker village, and the situation had to be opened up within twenty days. At that time, it was the busy farming season. In order to complete the plan, I ordered that the land be planted in a five-day blitz, planting during the day and holding meetings until midnight at night, non-stop, completely disregarding the fatigue of the masses. My work followed the route of village cadres and activists. Regardless of their class background, as long as they were active and dared to work, it was fine. I only saw that the village chief, Yang Xiufu, was active and listened to him in everything, without consulting with the masses. In Fancun, I forced the masses to prepare for war, ordering "whoever doesn't evacuate is not allowed." Without the masses' ideological awareness, I forced them to leave their homes. If Dongfancun didn't prepare for war, I sent carts from other villages to Xifancun to pull things, stimulating Dongfancun to prepare for war.

    In the past, I did not recognize these serious mistakes. The comrades in the district criticized me for having a Kuomintang style, but I did not accept it and did not humbly engage in self-criticism. I even complained that the Party did not take care of me. I always thought that I had suffered outside for several years and had lost out. I only compared myself to the backward and did not compare myself to the progressive comrades.

    After studying, I deeply realized that it was not that the Party did not trust me, but that I had let down the Party and the masses. I had forgotten my roots after being emancipated. Recalling that my family had been poor for generations, my father, mother, and brothers ate leaves and starved during famine years. Now my family has food and clothing, and we have also harvested wheat, and our life is very good. I "forgot the pain once the sore healed" and didn't want to engage in revolution anymore, forgetting about the many poor and hired peasants who had no food or drink. I feel really sorry for the oppressed class brothers. Now I understand, and I am determined to serve the poor and hired peasants.

### “疮好忘了疼”　崔子玉反省忘本思想

　　“疮好忘了疼”
  　崔子玉反省忘本思想
    （辉县人，贫农成份，四四年入党后即参加工作，现任新乡×区救联会主席。）
    我记事时，家里靠两把钁头，一把锄头开山荒，租种地生活。我十岁放牛，十五岁住长工，后来担脚赶嘴，我祖父、父亲都是住一辈长工，啥也没赚下。全家老小吃不饱穿不暖。可是我的阶级觉悟却很差。四四年减租觉得把大户都得罪下了，自己有点担心，想找个靠头，就这样参加了党。才出来工作很热情，后来慢慢的有些忘掉阶级弟兄，为个人打算起来了。分配到新乡工作后，看人家穿的都比自己强，比自己富裕，就拿没收子弹提奖的钱买了个毯子。想在各方面装备自己。因为急着解决婚姻问题，自己还包庇了一个地主女人。
    在工作中，行政命令很厉害，光一个人盲干，也不推动大家。到六赞城工作时，说是碉堡村，二十天一定要打开局面，当时正是农忙时候，我为完成计划，就下命令五天突击种完地，白天种地，黑夜开会开到半夜，昼夜不停，根本不顾群众疲劳。工作是走的村干积极分子路线，不管成份如何，只要积极敢干就行，光看见村长杨秀甫积极，一切听他话办事，也不和群众商量。在凡村强迫群众备战，下命令“谁不转移不行”，不通过群众思想自觉，逼迫群众离家。东凡村不备战，就派他村的大车给西凡村拉东西，这样来刺激东凡村备战。
    过去我对这些严重错误都不认识，区上同志批评我是国民党作风，我不接受，不虚心去自我批评，还埋怨党不照顾自己。总认为自己在外受罪好几年，是赔了本啦，光向落后看齐，不与进步的同志比。
    经过学习，才深刻认识到，不是党不相信自己，是自己对不起党，对不起群众，自己是翻了身忘了本。回想自己家辈辈受穷，灾荒年父亲、母亲兄弟吃树叶饿肚，现在我家有吃、有穿，还打下麦子，生活很好，自己就“疮好忘了疼”，不想干革命了，把许多没吃没喝的贫雇群众忘干净了。我感到实在对不起受压迫的阶级弟兄，现在我想通了，我一定决心为贫雇服务。
