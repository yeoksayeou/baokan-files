Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: TASS, New York, February 20th: The fall in US prices has entered its third week. Most American newspapers admit that even the "most brilliant experts" are confused by this chaotic economic situation. "U.S. News" magazine claims that recent market trends indicate the economy is on a downward path. "Business Week" and "Journal of Commerce" call on American capitalists to pay great attention. Many newspapers emphasize the serious nature of the consequences of the price plunge. The Journal of Commerce says that even if the current price drop is only a preliminary shock, it will greatly affect business. One symbol of the continuous stagnation in the securities market is that the Kaiser-Frazer automobile company had to withdraw $500,000 of newly issued stock last week. The hope of American manufacturers for large-scale sales of major commodities is very slim. According to estimates by American economists, the cost of purchasing major commodities this year will be two billion dollars less than last year. At the same time, the number of canceled equipment orders is increasing. This economic situation has caused panic among Washington politicians. The Wall Street Journal claims that Truman's economic advisors have begun drafting plans to cope with the impending economic crisis.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: New York dispatch: The US Department of Labor's statistics on the wholesale prices of 900 commodities, released on February 20th, show a "sharp drop in prices" (Associated Press report). The department's figure for the week ending February 14th (with 1926 as 100) was 151.7, while the previous week it was 163.8, and the post-war peak reached 165.5. The Department of Labor claims that the biggest drop was in agricultural product prices. It is reported that grain prices in Chicago and other places broke the two-day calm on the 20th and became unstable again, and on the 21st, they experienced a "general plunge," with stocks also falling at the same time. According to economic statistics from various New York newspapers, economic activity is confirmed to be declining. Railway freight volume for the week ending February 14th was 1.8 percent lower than the previous week and 8.2 percent lower than the same period last year. Coal production so far this year is eight million tons lower than the same period last year, and commercial and agricultural loans from New York banks decreased again by $75 million last week.

　　美物价暴跌进入第三周
  　经济活动日渐缩小
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：美国物价之跌落已进入第三周，美大多数报纸都承认：即使“最高明的专家”，也被这种混乱的经济情况弄得糊涂不堪了。“美国新闻”杂志称：最近的行情，表示经济已走到下坡路。“商业周刊”、“商务日报”号召美国资本家们应予以极大注意。许多报纸都强调物价暴跌后果的严重性质。商务日报说：即使目前的大跌价，只是初步的震动，但亦将大大影响商业。证券市场不断委结的象征之一，便是上周凯萨与佛拉萨大汽车公司不得不将发行的新股票收回五十万美元。美国制造商对于大量出售主要商品的希望，已很渺茫。据美国经济学家的估计，今年购买主要商品的费用，将比去年少二十亿美元。同时，取消装备定货的数目日益增加。这种经济局势，使华府政界人士惊惶万状。华尔街日报称：杜鲁门的一批经济顾问已开始草拟计划，以应付终将到来的经济危机。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】纽约讯：美劳工部二十日公布的九百种商品批发价格的统计，显示出“物价的尖锐下跌”（合众社讯）。该部截至十四日为止一周之数（以一九二六年为一百）为一五一点七，前一周则为一六三点八，战后最高峰达一六五点五。劳工部声称：此次暴跌以农产品跌价最大。据悉，芝加哥等地粮价二十日打破两日来的平静又告不稳，二十一日并“普遍暴跌”，股票亦同时跌落。另据纽约各报的经济统计，证实经济活动日渐低落。铁路运货量至十四日为止的一周内，较前周低百分之一点八，较去年同期低百分之八点二。今年迄今的煤产较去年同期低八百万吨，纽约上周各银行的工商农业贷款，再度减少七千五百万元。
