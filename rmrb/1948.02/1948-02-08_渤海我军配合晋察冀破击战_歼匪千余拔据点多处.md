Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th. To coordinate with the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army's disruption of the Chiang bandit's internal war arteries—the Ping-Han, Jin-Pu, Bei-Ning, and Ping-Sui Railways—our Bohai military achieved the following results from the 8th to the 19th of last month: We eradicated over twenty Chiang and puppet strongholds, including Xiaozhan, Jianshuizhan, and Xiagegu, liberating over two hundred villages and towns with a population of over one hundred thousand. We captured alive over seven hundred Chiang and puppet soldiers, including Chiang puppet Battalion Commander Cao Mansheng and below. We killed or wounded over three hundred. The entire Gao Hongji battalion was annihilated. We seized over twenty cannons of various sizes, twenty-nine light and heavy machine guns, over six hundred rifles and carbines, three trucks, over seven hundred rounds of various gun and artillery shells, and over a hundred mules and horses. Furthermore, we destroyed over twenty li of the Jinghai north-south railway, severely striking the Chiang-Fu bandits in the Tianjin-Beijing-Baoding triangle area, forcing them to retreat and defend Tianjin. Amidst the sounds of artillery fire, our troops opened granaries to provide relief to the poor. In Xiaozhan, we distributed a total of over six hundred and forty shi of grain—belonging to the four major landlords including Guo Demao, the puppet regular regiment battalion commander, and the grain seized from the enemy—along with the equipment from the puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Farmland Bureau, etc., to the masses.
