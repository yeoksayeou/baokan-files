Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 3rd of this month: The heroic and unyielding people of southern Shaanxi, under the brutal "village consolidation and relocation" policy of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, have risen up to save themselves, launching the Four-Anti (Anti-Capture, Anti-Tax, Anti-Conscription, Anti-Contribution) Movement everywhere. Guerrilla forces are also active on both sides of the Dan River, inflicting significant casualties on Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.

In October of last year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, imitating the "village consolidation and relocation" methods of the Japanese puppets in Manchukuo, ordered residents of all mountain villages to move to Chiang's strongholds. The people resisted fiercely, fleeing to the remote mountains and forests when faced with large groups of Chiang's bandit troops, and resolutely resisted individual Chiang bandit henchmen. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops then ordered the burning of villages. This atrocity was carried out as early as the winter of the year before last, when hundreds of villages were burned at once. For example, in the area east of Lantian, starting from Xujiamiao Town, the large and small villages in several river valleys within a radius of fifty *li* were all burned, with as many as 3,500 households victimized at one time. Furthermore, in the area east of Luonan, on the north bank of the Dan River, except for a few Chiang Kai-shek bandit strongholds such as Lingdan Temple, the area extending one hundred and twenty *li* east-west and fifty *li* north-south was all burned. Most of the surviving poor people were without clothing or food. Of the people concentrated in Jingcun, Luonan, twenty-two died of freezing in a major snowstorm. Having suffered such persecution, the people joined the guerrilla forces one after another.

The guerrilla forces have greatly developed, especially since the People's Liberation Army crossed the river south to conquer in August of last year, which gave the guerrilla forces a powerful boost. The guerrilla forces active in the Shangluo area along the Dan River launched ten active attacks on the enemy in November of last year alone, annihilating part of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops and local thugs, and capturing many strongholds. Under the support and protection of the guerrilla forces, the people in various places have further organized to settle accounts with Chiang's bandit henchmen and feudal exploitation. In a certain town, the masses settled accounts with the local tyrant Gao Laosi, and women and children actively participated in the struggle.

Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 3rd of this month: In the Lushan and Baofeng areas, liberated peasants have armed themselves to protect their land. After a short-term training course for activists in a certain area, more than ninety people immediately and voluntarily formed an "Armed Land Protection Brigade" to protect the land reform struggle in their own village and other villages. They combined with the masses to launch the "Three Searches" movement (search for people, search for guns, search for things). The masses in a certain village brought back Zhao Lao Ba, a major despotic landlord who had been hiding in another village. Some villages found guns hidden by landlords in wells, blockhouses, and other places. In one village of more than fifty households in a certain administrative village, peasants had already found more than forty rifles hidden by the landlord. Villages have recovered a large amount of gold, silver, clothing and other items buried by landlords from caves and the wilderness.

    反抗蒋胡匪并村烧杀
    陕南人民挺身自救
    在游击队保护下展开四抗运动
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三日电】陕南英勇不屈的人民在蒋胡匪“并村移民”的暴行下奋起自救，到处展开四抗（抗捕、抗税、抗丁、抗款）运动，游击队亦活跃于丹江两岸，予蒋胡匪以重大杀伤。去年十月间蒋胡匪又仿照日伪在伪满的“移民并村”办法，下令各山沟村庄居民一律移向蒋匪据点。人民纷起反抗，在大股蒋匪逼迫时逃往深山老林，对个别蒋匪爪牙则坚决抵抗，蒋胡匪乃下令焚毁村庄。这种暴行远在前年冬季就实行过，曾经一次焚毁了几百个村子，如蓝田以东地区由许家庙镇起，方圆五十里的几条川沟大小村庄都被烧光，一次被害人民就达三千五百户。又雒南以东，丹江北岸地区除灵丹庙等少数蒋胡匪据点外，东西一百二十余里，南北五十多里的地区都被焚毁。幸存的贫民大都无衣无食，被集中于雒南景村的人民，在一次大风雪中就冻死了二十二个。人民经此迫害，纷纷参加游击队。游击队得到很大的发展，尤其是去年八月解放军渡河南征，更予游游击队以有力的帮助。活跃丹江沿岸商雒地区的游击队仅在去年十一月间就主动袭敌十次，歼蒋胡匪及土顽等一部，并攻占据点多处。各地人民又在游击队的撑腰保护下，进一步组织起来，清算蒋匪爪牙及封建剥削。某镇群众清算了恶霸高老四，妇女小孩都积极卷入了斗争。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三日电】鲁山、宝丰地区，翻身农民已武装起来保田。某地积极分子短期集训后，立即有九十多人自动组成“武装保田大队”，保护本村及外村的翻身斗争。他们结合群众发动“三找”运动（找人、找枪、找东西）。某村群众把隐藏在外村的大恶霸地主赵老八找回来。有的村庄从水井、炮楼等地方找出地主隐藏的枪支。某行政村一个五十多户的村庄里农民已找到地主隐藏的四十多支步枪，各村从地洞和野外找回地主埋藏的金银衣物等极多。
