Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Moscow News: Spring ploughing has been completed in the southern Soviet Union, and summer crops have been sown. This year, the tractor-cultivated area in this region has increased by 31 million hectares compared to last year. The Soviet Union had an unusually warm winter, the warmest in decades. Even in Transcaucasia, the temperature never dropped below freezing. This year, the region and Central Asia planted potatoes for the first time in February, which can be harvested in July, followed by potatoes and cabbage, allowing for two harvests a year. Spring ploughing has now begun in the Kuban River basin of the North Caucasus and the area north of southern Ukraine. According to a report by Soviet Minister of Agriculture Benediktov to the Supreme Soviet at the beginning of the month, the sown area in the formerly occupied areas where spring ploughing has begun has exceeded last year and has fully recovered to pre-war levels. Collective farms across the Soviet Union are now holding general membership meetings to review last year's work and formulate this year's production plans. Due to last year's bumper harvest, the meetings of collective farms are particularly joyous. Collective farmers have unanimously proposed exceeding this year's plan and guaranteeing the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.

    苏联南部完成春耕
    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联南部春耕业已完成，夏季作物已播种完毕，今年该区拖拉机耕种面积较去年增加三千一百万公顷。苏联今冬奇暖，为数十年来所未有，甚至在外高加索，温度亦始终没有降至冰点以下。该区与中亚细亚今年首次在二月份即种下洋芋，七月份即可收获，接着又可种洋芋和卷心菜，因此一年可收两季。现北高加索库班河流域以及乌克兰南部迤北地区已先后开始春耕。据苏联农业部长本尼迪克托夫月初在最高苏维埃报告：现已开始春耕的前敌占区，播种面积已超过去年而完全恢复战前水平。全苏各地集体农庄现正纷纷举行全体庄员大会，检讨去年工作，制定今年生产计划。由于去年的大丰收，各地集体农庄的会议特别显得喜气洋溢。集体农民们一致提出超过今年计划、提前完成五年计划的保证。
