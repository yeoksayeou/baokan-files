　　Beihangtou Inspection Committee
  　Damaging the Interests of Middle Peasants, Insufficient Recognition of Errors
    [Taihang News] The Beihangtou Inspection Committee of Huguan (established to prevent the sabotage of the Land Law) accepted the opinion of the local Xinhua Daily and returned the property confiscated from the wealthy middle peasant. The letter stated: "On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, we received the Xinhua Daily of the 11th, which published the news and opinions about our village's Inspection Committee confiscating the hidden goods of wealthy middle peasant Guo Xianhe. We completely agree. Three days after the confiscation, after our research, we felt we were wrong. This is because we did not promote the Land Law sufficiently. On the 15th of this month, we personally returned these things to Guo Xianhe and apologized to him. ......"
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    Editor's Note: The mistake made by the Inspection Committee is serious. This is not just a matter of whether the Land Law was sufficiently promoted, but rather it damaged the interests of middle peasants, which is to sabotage the Land Law. A thorough review should be conducted from an ideological perspective.

　　北行头巡查委员会
  　损害中农利益  认识错误不够
    【太行消息】壶关北行头巡查委员会（为防止破坏土地法而成立），接受此间新华日报的意见，退回没收富裕中农的财产。该信中说：“本月十四日下午，我们接到了十一日新华日报，上面登载的我村巡查委员会没收富裕中农郭先和偷藏东西的消息和意见后，我们完全同意。在没收后三天，我们研究结果，就觉得错了，这是怨我们对土地法宣传的不够。本月十五日，我们就把这些东西，亲手给郭先和送回，并向他道了歉。………”
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：巡查委员会犯的错误是严重的，这不是宣传土地法够不够的问题，而是损害了中农利益，也就是破坏了土地法，应从思想上作深入的检讨。
