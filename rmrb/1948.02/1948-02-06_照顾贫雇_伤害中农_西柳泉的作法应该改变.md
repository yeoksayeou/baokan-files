    "Caring for the Poor Hired Labor" Harms Middle Peasants:
    Xiliuquan's Approach Should Be Changed
    [Shahe News] When Xiliuquan in the fourth district of Shahe established a credit cooperative, it called on the masses to raise shares. Of the 67 households in the village, 41 households were middle peasants, upper-middle peasants, and those who had been struggled against, and 26 were poor peasants. The households above the middle peasant level raised a total of 284,650 yuan in shares. When the village cadres saw that the shares were all from middle peasants and there was no money for poor peasants to raise shares, the village chief said: Our village has a blacksmith shop and a cooperative. This year, each yuan of shares can yield one yuan in dividends in the second half of the year. The shares of the blacksmith shop and the cooperative totaled 2,245,000 yuan. Let's have the credit cooperative shares and the cooperative shares collectively distribute dividends. The shares of the middle and upper-middle peasants will account for two-thirds, and the poor peasants will account for one-third. The government proposes to take care of the poor hired laborers. If the poor hired laborers do not have shares, how can they distribute dividends? After research, the village cadres asked the poor hired laborers to borrow money from the credit cooperative and then use it to buy shares in the credit cooperative. The monthly interest rate for poor peasants' loans is two percent, and each yuan of shares can yield one yuan in dividends. They started in October and distributed dividends after two months in December. The poor hired laborers thought, "I'll go to the credit cooperative to borrow money and then buy shares." The poor hired laborers said: "We have money to buy shares, and we can also get dividends." Eighteen poor peasant households borrowed a total of 154,000 yuan and all bought shares. (Yuan Junxian, Zhang Xiuhai, Shahe Sub-branch)
    The village cadres want to seek some benefits for the poor hired laborers, which is a good intention. However, borrowing money from the credit cooperative for the poor hired laborers, with low interest, and then buying shares with high dividends, those who suffer are the middle peasants who invest more. If the middle peasants suffer losses, they will inevitably be dissatisfied, which is not good for the poor hired laborers. We suggest that we still find ways to borrow money from banks or cooperatives to organize the poor hired laborers to actively produce, which is the correct way to solve the problem.

    “照顾贫雇”伤害中农
    西柳泉的作法应该改变
    【沙河消息】沙河四区西柳泉成立信用部时，号召群众集股。全村六十七户，中农、上中农和被斗户共四十一户，贫农二十六户，中农以上的户集股共二十八万四千六百五十元。村干部看了股金都是中农的，贫农没有钱集股，村长说：咱村有个铁匠炉，还有合作社，今年后半年股金一元能分红一元。铁匠炉和合作社的股金共二百二十四万五千元，咱们让信用部股金与合作社股金集体分红，中农、上中农的股金就占三分之二，贫农占三分之一，政府提出叫照顾贫雇，贫雇没有股金，如何分红利？村干部经过研究，叫贫雇从信用部贷出款来，再入到信用部顶股金。贫雇贷款月利是二分，股金分红每元能分红一元。从十月份搞起来，到十二月两个月的时间就分红。贫雇想这我就到信用部去贷款，再入股。贫雇说：有钱集股金了，也能分红了。有贫雇十八户，共贷款一十五万四千元，都入了股金。（沙河支行元俊贤、张秀海）
    村干部想给贫雇谋些利益，这是一片好心，但是，从信用部给贫雇贷出钱，利息少，再去入股，红利大，吃亏的是入股多的中农。中农吃亏，必然不满意，对贫雇没有好处。我们建议，还是设法从银行或合作社贷上款，组织贫雇积极生产，才是正确解决问题的道路。          ——编者
