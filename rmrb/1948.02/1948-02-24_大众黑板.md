    ★ A spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party delivered an important speech, heavily criticizing the United States for helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war. They said: No matter how much money, guns, ammunition the United States gives to Chiang Kai-shek, it won't save Chiang Kai-shek's life. Chiang Kai-shek is being beaten to death by the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas and the people of the whole country.
    ★ The local armed forces of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region recovered the county seat of Minquan on the Longhai Railway.
    ★ Prices in the KMT-controlled areas are rising steadily, especially fiercely recently. In Yuci, near Taiyuan, a half-tael sesame seed cake sells for five thousand yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency). Judging from this alone, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan are also nearing their end.

    ★中国共产党中央的发言人，发表了一个重要谈话，重重的批评美国帮助蒋介石打内战。说：你美国不管是给蒋介石钱、枪炮、子弹，都救不了蒋介石的命，蒋介石被解放区军民和全国人民一块打得是快死亡了。
    ★冀鲁豫地方武装，收复了陇海铁路上的民权县城。
    ★蒋管区物价一个劲往上涨，最近尤其涨得凶，太原附近的榆次，一两半重的烧饼就卖五千块钱（蒋介石票）。光从这一点看，蒋介石、阎锡山也快完蛋啦。
