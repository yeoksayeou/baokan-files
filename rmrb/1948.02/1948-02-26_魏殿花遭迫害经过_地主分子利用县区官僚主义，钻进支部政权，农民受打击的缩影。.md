The Persecution of Wei Dianhua

A microcosm of landlord elements exploiting county and district bureaucracy to infiltrate branch power, leading to farmer oppression.

Comrade Wei Dianhua, of hired peasant origin, after the Japanese surrender, saw that the village administration in his village was controlled by a group of landlords and traitors led by Wei Jintang. They struggled against Wei Jianxin, Wei Chunliang, Wei Diankui, and other poor and hired peasants. Qu Yufu, an enemy agent who had led the enemy into the village to kill three militiamen, was even allowed to join the farmers' association and share the spoils of struggle. The village secretary was Wei Jinming, a rich peasant who had been a puppet police officer. He was very angry, and directly confronted the village cadres. Seeing that Old Wei was fighting for the farmers, the village cadres began to attack Old Wei. Once, they forced Wei Zhilian, a bankrupt rich peasant, to falsely accuse Old Wei of conspiring with him to sell a canvas awning, and further accused him of harboring landlords. But Old Wei did not back down because of this. He opposed the "election" of the bad person Wei Jingwu as director of the military committee, and later exposed at a mass meeting that the village chief Wei Jingsheng was personally appointed by the landlord Wei Jintang. Both of them saw Old Wei as a thorn in their side. In May of the following year, Old Wei returned home due to old age and disability. He reported the serious situation in his village to the sub-district, who wrote a letter asking him to talk to the county. The county then wrote a letter asking him to talk to the district. He raised to Guo Quanyou, the district political commissar, that puppet soldiers and enemy agents had joined the farmers' association and become cadres, while many poor and hired peasants were shut out of the farmers' association. But Guo Quanyou did not go to the village to investigate. Instead, he listened to Wei Jintang and other cadres, believing that Old Wei liked to take the upper-level route and had personal prejudices against the village cadres. He even refused to transfer Old Wei's Party membership back home. Wei Jintang returned to the village and stirred up trouble, saying, "Old Wei went to the county and district to sue you. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be able to handle it!" This made all the village cadres extremely resentful towards Old Wei. Old Wei could not transfer his Party membership back to the village and could not even participate in the farmers' association, so he went to Guo Quanyou. Guo Quanyou always vaguely prevaricated. It was not until the third time that he was introduced back to the village. Although the branch was controlled by landlords, they still did not allow him to participate in Party meetings. However, Old Wei paid his Party dues every month. When land reform began, the village struggled against some landlords and rich peasants who had no direct relationship with these bad village cadres. Although Old Wei was not able to participate in the farmers' association, he was very active in the struggle. The village cadres were forced to give him a courtyard and fifteen mu of land (at that time, the spoils were distributed based on the problem). But Old Wei did not compromise because of this. He continued to demand that all poor and hired peasants participate in the farmers' association and that puppet soldiers and bankrupt landlords be expelled from the farmers' association. He went to the county to make suggestions twice, but to no avail. So he mobilized among the poorest of the poor and hired peasants, wanting to organize them. At this time, the masses demanded to continue the struggle, but the village cadres stubbornly protected their own group and refused to struggle against them. They struggled against two military dependents (landlord Wei Lanru and Wei Huaniang) and a demobilized soldier, Wei Xianfu (of poor peasant background). Wei Lanru was a cadre from a landlord background. Dissatisfied with the struggle against his family, he and Wei Huaniang invited Old Wei, Wei Xianfu, Wei Jingshun (a poor peasant who had also just returned from the army), and others to go to the county to file a complaint. The purpose was to avoid being struggled against or to lessen the struggle. Old Wei reviewed his own actions, admitting that he did not fully recognize their landlord faces at the time. But he was not complaining about the wrongful struggle against the military dependents and landlords, but about the fact that the poor and hired peasants could not participate in the farmers' association and were oppressed by the landlord-controlled village cadres and could not stand up. The county leadership did not distinguish between him and Wei Lanru, uniformly viewing it as factional struggle. They instructed the district to allow them to present their views at a mass meeting to clarify the rights and wrongs. They only said that Old Wei could participate in the farmers' association. When the district chief spoke to the village cadres, he met with great resistance. Then, the village held a mass meeting. They (Wei Lanru was not present) brought up the crimes and errors of the village cadres. The struggle began to intensify. These landlord elements decided to retaliate with the most vicious means. The first step was to use the contradictions between the district cadres (at that time, Wei Jintang had been transferred to the county) to attack District Chief Wang, who advocated supporting Old Wei. The village cadres reported to Deputy District Chief Xi, saying that District Chief Wang allowed landlords and struggle targets to participate in the farmers' association to rectify the cadres, and that the internal struggle in the village could not be carried out. According to District Chief Wang, Guo Quanyou had severely criticized him, questioning him, "What's going on?" The second step was to detain Old Wei, Wei Xianfu, and Wei Huaniang, and buy off Wei Jingshun, who had filed the complaint with Old Wei, threatening Jingshun, saying that Old Wei and Lanru were special agents, and asking him whether he wanted to follow feudalism or the masses. They also said that if he confessed, there would be no problem with dividing houses and land. Wei Jingshun wavered, saying that Wei Lanru said on the way that if it could not be resolved, he would take the militia's guns. Wei Jingwu, the director of the military committee, and Wei Jingsheng, the village chief, attributed Lanru's words to Old Wei's head, announcing to the masses that Old Wei wanted to take the militia's guns and was a special agent. They forced them to confess who they were organizing and where the Kuomintang certificate and guns were. If they did not admit it, they would be detained and beaten, put on a bench, their legs tied with ropes and bricks placed under their heels, to the point where seven bricks were piled up, their toes as high as their eyebrows, and they nearly died several times. They forced Old Wei's cousin, Wei Miliang, to say at the meeting that Old Wei wanted to murder him, forcing him four or five times. If he did not say it, they said he wanted to follow the special agents. The bad cadres tried to kill them several times, but did not succeed because District Chief Wang forbade it. Later, they used the excuse that the masses demanded action and insisted on holding a meeting. District Chief Wang discovered this conspiracy and ordered it to stop. They even said, "You are afraid of struggling against special agents, you are timid!" District Chief Wang insisted, "Whoever kills anyone is responsible!" so there was no trouble. At the end of the year, the masses bailed them out. On the sixth day of the first lunar month, Old Wei's son, Wei Ziyi, was again detained by the village cadres because he helped Wei Huaniang write a complaint against Wei Jintang and his gang, which they saw in the district. Wei Ziyi was hung up for three days and three nights. Unable to bear it, he escaped. They detained Old Wei and Wei Xianfu again. Wei Ziyi also returned because he had nowhere to run. At this time, Wei Jintang had been renamed the joint school principal. The county leadership found out that he was indeed a landlord, a puppet township head... and expelled him from the Party and squeezed him back to the village to be struggled against. In order to deceive the district and the masses, the village cadres also formally swept him out the door, but politically he was not defeated. The village cadres were still secretly colluding with him. After Wei Jintang was struggled against, his hatred for Wei Ziyi deepened. Not long after, a poisoning incident occurred at the No. 2 High School in the county. The "culprit" was found to be Wei Xinyue (Wei Hua's younger brother) from Xisuzhuang. Wei Xinyue did not admit that he was the one who poisoned. Teacher Han Shangtian (a landlord) led the students to hang him up and beat him, saying that three or four letters had already come from your village, why haven't you confessed yet? They lured and threatened him to implicate Wei Lanru and Wei Ziyi as the ones who gave him the poison. The principal wrote a letter back to the village, and the village cadres used this to hang up and beat Wei Ziyi, forcing him to confess. At the mass meeting, they made Wei Ziyi crawl like a dog. Although Wei Jintang was already a struggle target, when Wei Ziyi escaped, he was still able to write a note to send militiamen to catch him. Old Wei and his son and Wei Xianfu were not released until February 19th. Old Wei and Wei Xianfu's demobilization certificates were confiscated, and they were all swept out the door. Even Old Wei's brother, Wei Dianchen, was swept out the door. Old Wei's family had only one dou of rice and two dou of buckwheat, and Wei Dianchen's family had only one bag of grain, and they were all about to starve. They were forced to do hard labor for the landlord elements and were not allowed to talk to anyone. In this way, when the villagers saw Wei Dianhua's experience, everyone was afraid to say anything. The arrogance of the landlord elements reached its extreme. It was only after Wei Dianhua's problem was clarified this time that the masses began to raise their heads.

　　魏殿花遭迫害经过
    地主分子利用县区官僚主义，钻进支部政权，农民受打击的缩影。
    雇贫出身的魏殿花同志在日本投降后，看到自己村里以魏锦堂为首的一伙地主、汉奸把持村政，斗争了魏见心、魏春良、魏殿魁等贫雇，曾带领敌人来村打死三个民兵的敌探曲裕夫，反而参加了农会，分斗争果实。村书记是当过伪警察的富农魏锦明，他很气愤，便正面和村干部顶撞。村干看到老魏替农民打不平，于是开始向老魏进攻；有一次强迫一破落富农魏之连诬赖老魏与他合卖了一个布蓬，进而说他包庇地主。但老魏并未因此退缩，他反对“选”坏人魏景武当武委会主任，后来又在群众大会上揭穿村长魏景升是地主魏锦堂个人指定的，他们俩个就都把老魏看成了眼中钉。次年五月，老魏因年老残废，复员回家。他到分区时报告了本村的严重情况，分区写信叫他和县上谈，县上又写信叫他和区上谈，他向区政委郭全有提出伪军敌探参加农会，当了干部。许多贫雇反而关在农会门外，但郭全有不到村里调查，反听信了魏锦堂及其他干部的话，认为老魏好走上层路线，和村干有私人成见。连党的关系也不替他介绍回家。魏锦堂又回村挑拨说：“老魏到县上区上告你们，要不是我，看你们吃得消吧！”使全体村干对老魏都非常仇恨。老魏回村接不上党的关系，连农会也不能参加，就去找郭全有，郭全有总是含糊推诿。到第三次，才介绍回村。虽然支部被地主把持仍然不吸收他参加党的会议，老魏却按月向党交纳党费。土地改革开始，该村斗争了一些与这些坏村干没有直接关系的地主富农。老魏虽然没有能参加农会，但对斗争却很积极。村干逼不得已，只好分给他一座院子、十五亩地（当时是按问题分果实）。但是老魏并未因此妥协，继续要求贫雇都参加农会，驱逐伪军破落地主出农会，他又到县提两次意见，没有结果，他于是在最贫苦的贫雇中活动，想把他们组织起来。此时群众要求继续斗争，村干死包庇住自己这一伙不斗，斗了两户军属（地主魏兰如、魏花娘），又斗了复员军人魏贤福（贫农成份），魏兰如是个地主出身的干部，因家庭被斗不满，他和魏花娘邀老魏、魏贤福、魏景顺（贫农，也是才从部队回来的）等同去县上告状，目的是想不斗或轻斗自己，老魏自己检讨，当时对他们的地主面目认识不足。但他告的不是错斗了军属地主，而是贫雇不能参加农会，受地主掌握的村干压迫不能翻身，县领导上没有区别他与魏兰如的不同，一律看成是宗派斗争。指示区可让他们在群众大会上提竟见，以辩明是非。只说了句可让老魏参加农会，区长向村干谈时，便遇很大抵抗。接着，村里召开群众大会，他们（魏兰如不在了）把村干的罪恶错误都提出来了，斗争开始尖锐，这些地主分子们决定以最毒狠的手段实行报复。第一步是利用区干部之间的矛盾（当时魏锦堂已调到县）打击主张为老魏撑腰的王区长。村干向席副区长会报，说王区长让地主、斗争对象参加农会来整干部，村内斗争已无法进行。据王区长说郭全有曾严厉批评他。质问他“怎么搞的？”第二步是把老魏、魏贤福、魏花娘都扣起来，收买了与老魏一道告状的魏景顺，威胁景顺说老魏与兰如是特务，问他是跟封建走是跟群众走？又说坦白了分房分地不成问题。魏景顺动摇了，说魏兰如路上说解决不了就下民兵的枪。武委会主任魏景武、村长魏景升就把兰如说的话按到老魏头上，向群众宣布老魏要下民兵枪，是特务。逼他们坦白组织的谁？国民党证和枪在哪里？不承认就扣押起来吊打、上板凳，腿上捆着绳子脚跟垫砖，垫到七块脚尖与眉毛一般高断气死去几次。威逼老魏堂弟魏米良到大会上说老魏想谋害他，逼了四五次，不说就说他想跟特务走。坏干部几次企图害死他们，因王区长不准未达目的。后又借口群众要求处理，硬要开会，王区长发现这一阴谋，命令停止。他们竟说：“你害怕斗争特务，你胆小！”王区长坚持“谁害死谁负责！”才没有出乱子。年底群众把他们保出来。正月初六老魏儿子魏子义，又被村干扣起来了，因他帮魏花娘写状告魏锦堂一伙，这状在区上被他们看见了。魏子义被吊了三天三夜，吃不住逃跑，他们把老魏和魏贤福又扣起来，魏子义因无处跑也回来了。此时魏锦堂已改任联合校长，县领导上查明他确系地主，伪大乡长……，把他开除党籍挤回村来斗争。村干为了欺哄区上和群众，形式上也扫地出门了，但政治上并未被斗垮，村干暗地仍在和他勾搭。魏锦堂被斗之后，对魏子义仇恨更深。以后不久该县二高就发生了特务放毒事件。查出“凶手”是西苏庄魏鑫岳（魏花之弟），魏鑫岳不承认是他放毒。教员韩尚田（地主）领导学生吊打他，说你们村里已经来了三四封信，还不坦白？诱骗、威胁他咬出魏兰如、魏子义给的他毒药，校长写信回村，村干就依此吊打魏子义，逼他坦白，在群众大会上要魏子义学狗爬，魏锦堂虽然已经是斗争对象，但当魏子义逃跑时，他却还能写条子派民兵去捉。老魏父子和魏贤福到二月十九才被放出来，老魏和魏贤福的复员证都被没收了，他们都被扫地出门了，连老魏哥哥魏殿臣也被扫地出门了。老魏家只有一斗米两斗荞麦，魏殿臣家只有一布袋谷，很快都要挨饿。他们被罚给地主分子做苦工，不准和人说话。这样，全村农民们看到魏殿花的遭遇，大家都不敢吭气了，地主分子气焰高涨到达极点，只是这次魏殿花问题弄清楚后，群众才算开始抬起头来。
