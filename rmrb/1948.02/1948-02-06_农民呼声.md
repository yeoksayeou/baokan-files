Voices of the Peasants

Peasants:

We are opening this "Voices of the Peasants" column so that everyone can use it to denounce the evils of the landlords, expose shortcomings in our work, promote things that we peasants think are good and appropriate, and put forward our own demands and suggestions for improving our work. All institutions, organizations, and individuals mentioned by everyone must express their attitude, make self-criticism where necessary, and accept and implement what everyone agrees on. If there are disagreements, explanations can be given, and different opinions can be put forward.

Those who can write should write themselves. Those who cannot write can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write for them, or come to the newspaper office in person. If that's not possible, write a letter to the newspaper to let us know, and we can figure out a way.

专栏：

    农民呼声农民们：
    我们辟这个“农民呼声”栏，为的是让大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作里面的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度，该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。
    大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。
