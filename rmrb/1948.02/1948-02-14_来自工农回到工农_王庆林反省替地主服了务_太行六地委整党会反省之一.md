    From a Worker-Peasant Background, Returning to the Worker-Peasant Masses
    Wang Qinglin's Self-Criticism on Serving the Landlords
    One of the Self-Criticisms from the Taihang Sixth District Party Committee Rectification Meeting
    (Comrade Wang is from Dahui Village, Wuan Sixth District, of poor peasant background, and a former hired laborer. He joined the Party in October 1938, and started working in the district in September 1945. He is currently an executive committee member of the Sixth District Party Committee.)

    I've been out for four or five years. I went to work in Yangquan. Xie Laowen there is a feudal landlord. In the branch meeting, after discussion and struggle, I felt he should also be taken care of because he once sent my family thirty catties of white flour. I knew I had been tricked by the landlord, so I told Political Commissar Li. Political Commissar Li said to admit it to the masses and say I bought it from him with money. In my heart, I thought I ate half of his flour, and then give him money, I was not happy.

    Village Chief Zhao Yongliang is from a rich peasant background and wormed his way into the Party. I was afraid the masses would struggle against him, so I asked him to donate two mu of land to the masses, so that he wouldn't be struggled against. This way the masses would welcome it, and he could still be the village chief. But at the time, the honest peasants were not satisfied. When I left the village, I asked Comrade Wang (village cadre) in the village to help me get a blanket, and he agreed.

    I have relatives in the east slope of Miaoyu Village. I thought, this is my wife's family, just organize a struggle, but don't kick them out. So that people could say, "It's still his brother-in-law who's in charge."

    When I got to Kou Village, I struggled against Hao Yuzhen. Hao raised more than a hundred sheep and had ten mu of land. He was the manager of the cooperative. I lived in the cooperative. After I went to sleep, he woke me up to have soup and wine. He told me about his past poverty, saying that he had already been struggled against lightly in the first movement, and now people are moving again. I said, "Don't be afraid, you can keep some." At the village struggle meeting, I expressed an opinion, saying, "Hao Yuzhen can work for the benefit of the masses, look at how our cooperative makes more money than others." I said to let him keep a few sheep, don't touch the grain, keep some houses, and give him back a ram. Later, Hao said he benefited from my influence.

    I went to work in Chenjiaping. Landlord Wen Xingbang raised forty or fifty sheep. When the district cadres went, they ate at his house. He told me that when he moved here, he was very poor and built himself up by herding sheep and farming. As he said this, he asked his family to make dumplings. I said no, and he said, "What are you afraid of? You still have to help me in this struggle!" I again followed his line, criticizing the village cadres at the meeting for preventing harm to "middle peasant interests."

    This autumn, I went back and told my wife, "Our little donkey, if the landlord wants to borrow it, let's lend it to him if we don't need it, we have to unite with him." I felt sorry for the landlord, but I didn't feel sorry for the poor peasants. My family has two and a half mu of cotton, picked eighty or ninety catties of clean cotton, and sold twenty catties on credit to the landlord. I said it doesn't matter if you don't have money, give it whenever you have it. Upon self-examination, I am one with the landlord, and it will be terrible if this continues. I am truly from a hired laborer background. My second grandfather worked as a long-term laborer for others and couldn't go back in December because he fell into a ravine while chopping firewood for the landlord, and his body was never found. My grandfather was the same. I also worked as a long-term laborer for three years. But now I don't think about these things anymore, I have become detached from the poor and hired classes, and have developed hedonistic thoughts. Hearing that I was going to Taihang Mountain in the future, I asked the organization to approve a divorce, wanting to find another partner. Later, Political Commissar Li explained it to me, and it got better. When I go back this time, I must do some good things for the masses, and I must confess my bad thoughts to the masses.

    王庆林反省替地主服了务
    太行六地委整党会反省之一
    （王同志系武安六区大灰村人，贫农成份，雇工出身。一九三八年十月入党，四五年九月到区工作，现任六区区委执委。）
    我出来四五年了。出来到羊圈工作。那里谢老温是封建地主，我在支部会谈，斗争后也应照顾他。因为他有一次给我家里送来三十斤白面，我知道这一下受了地主的骗，就向李政委说，李政委说向群众承认一下，就说花钱买了他的算了。我心里想吃了人家一半，再给人家钱，我不高兴。
    赵永亮村长是富农成份，钻到党内来，我怕群众斗他，叫他献出二亩地给群众，即不斗他了。这样群众既欢迎，村长仍可叫他当。但当时老实农民不满意。我离开这个村时，请村上王同志（村干）帮助弄个毯子，他答应了。
    庙宇村东坡有我亲戚，我想这里是我丈人家，只组织一下斗斗，可不要扫地出门。好叫人家说个“还是他姐丈顶事。”
    到了口上村，斗争郝玉贞。郝喂了一百多个羊，十来亩地，他在合作社当经理。我住在合作社，我睡了，他叫起我来，喝汤吃酒。他给我谈过去穷，说头一回运动时斗的他就不轻，这回人家又运动了。我说：“不怕，可以留点。”在村上开斗争会，我就发表了一个意见，我说：“郝玉贞这人能为群众谋利益，看咱这个合作社赚钱比别人多。”我说给他留几个羊，粮食不动，房子留点，羊再给他丢个公羊。后来郝说沾了我的光。
    到陈家坪工作。地主温兴邦喂了四五十个羊。区干部去了就在他家吃饭，他给我说：他往这搬时很穷，是放羊加种地搞起来的。说到这里就叫家里包饺子。我不叫，他说：“怕啥”？这次斗争你还不帮帮我哩！”我又走了他的路线，在村干部会上批评了不该防害“中农利益”。
    今年秋天回去给娘们说：“咱家小驴，人家地主来借，咱不用就借给人家用用，要给人家团结。”我觉得地主可怜，但不觉得贫农可怜。我家有二亩半花，摘了八九十斤净花，赊给地主二十斤，我说没钱不要紧，啥时有啥时给。我检讨起来是和地主一块肉，发展下去可不得了。我真正是雇工出身。我二爷给人家做长工，腊月不能回去。因为给人家地主打柴，跌到山沟里尸首也找不回来了。我爷也是一样。我也做了三年长工。可是我现在就不想这些了，脱离了贫雇阶级，并且发展了享乐思想了。听说将来要下太行山，便要求组织上批准离婚，想另找个对象，后来李政委给我解释了，好了些。这次回去后，可要好好给群众办点事情，咱有坏思想也要给群众反省。
