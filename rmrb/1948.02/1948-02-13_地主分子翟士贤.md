Comrade Zhang Zonglin, representing the first cadre group of the Peking University College of Arts and Education, reported on Zhai Moxin's materials and his attitude towards learning in this land reform study:

Zhai Moxin, originally named Zhai Shixian, is from Boyan Town, Wu'an. He is thirty-four years old this year, works at the College of Arts and Education, and is a Communist Party member. His father, Zhai Hongwen, was a "big figure" in Boyan, a landlord and bully who often arrested tenant farmers and sent them to officials. His family owned more than 500 mu of land, of which about 300 mu were purchased outright, and about 200 mu were mortgaged. He had about 200 rooms, occupying one-half of the entire village, as well as a garden, and several shops in Kaifeng and other places.

Zhai's mother was an extremely vicious woman who abused maids, poking them with cigarette sticks, burning them with red-hot irons, and starving them. Zhai Moxin and his four younger sisters helped beat them. According to Zhai himself, they killed two people and crippled another.

In addition to collecting rent, the Zhai family also hired laborers to farm the land, treating them even more harshly. The best worker could not earn more than forty yuan a year, and wages were only paid at the end of the year. Even if a worker's parents became ill or died, they could not borrow a penny. A dozen or so workers lived in a small room, living with the livestock. Once, a worker fell asleep with his mouth open, and he actually urinated into the worker's mouth.

Zhai Moxin relied on exploiting the blood and sweat of the peasants to live an extremely luxurious life. He lived in a large house with elaborate furnishings, constantly filled with fragrance, either floral or perfume. He ate white flour, rice, fish, and meat. The number of his clothes was even harder to count. His first wife's dowry alone included fifty or sixty quilts and two or three hundred pieces of fur and silk clothing. The family kept six or seven good livestock, and had a car and a mule-drawn carriage. They also kept many fierce dogs to guard the house at night, and ordinary poor people did not dare to enter his home. Zhai Moxin grew up in this family.

He stood on the side of the landlord to sabotage land reform: At the beginning of the rent and interest reduction policy, he wrote to the local working comrades, asking them to take care of his family.

He returned home four times during the land reform:

The first time, he rode home on horseback and held a grand banquet. As soon as he got home, he demanded 5,000 yuan in debt from his father. He wrote to the Central Bureau, saying: "Why should we distribute floating wealth?" He told the landlords: "The cadres have not been trained well yet. Once they are trained, there will be no floating wealth."

The second and third times, he rode back home ostentatiously, and interceded for a large landlord named Fang (his uncle) who was detained by the Public Security Bureau, even asking Fang to teach at Peking University, but this did not materialize. He also sold seventeen mu of good land, and built an air-raid shelter for his sister, hiding mules, gold rings, blankets, etc.

The fourth time, when he returned home, he was very angry to see that his family had been struggled against, and asked the district political commissar what was going on. He then began to settle accounts in reverse, insulting village cadre Lao Niu as a special agent. The county committee supported the masses, but he saw that the situation was not good, so he talked about the domestic and international situation, and sowed discord between the cadres and the masses, telling Lao Niu: "The masses want to struggle against you, but I refused." He also sold eighteen mu of good land, leaving three good houses, saying that his father would live there when he returned. He brought out a lot of personal belongings, and even brought out a little girl named Juhua, telling her that he was bringing her out to go to school, but in reality, she is now taking care of his children. According to Zhai, he brought her out because he was afraid that Juhua would marry someone and struggle against him, and because Juhua knew some places where his family's hidden valuables were stored.

He brought out some floating wealth from his home, such as gold rings... He also thought of going to his father-in-law's house to dig for gold. He sold the bribe mule and asked someone to sell the pistol butt to Shimen (later confiscated by the military region). He used public livestock for private production. He spent tens of thousands of yuan enjoying himself at Peking University for two years.

During the land reform, he released ten landlords one after another, some to Shimen, some to Kaifeng. Last year, when the People's Daily first exposed the truth about Zhai Shixian's "land donation," he was furious and told his classmates that the newspaper was full of nonsense. When someone asked him to reflect, he said: "Why not take care of my family?" At the cadre study group meeting, he emphasized that his father was an enlightened person who could be educated, saying that he was a Marxist-Leninist. He also said: "The crimes I have committed, if I were in the army, I wouldn't be afraid of anything, at most a warning. But in school, the old man's (referring to the president) hurdle is difficult to pass." He also said: "If I am expelled from the Party, I will definitely appeal." After the May 4th Directive, he told a newly arrived teacher: "Now it is even more severe than physically eliminating landlords during the civil war!"

He had four kinds of statements about land reform: (1) Regarding the landlords who were struggled against and opposed the working people, he said: "The cadres have not been trained well yet." Meaning he sympathized with the landlords and felt that the cadres had struggled against them incorrectly. (2) To the masses, it was intimidation. For example, he told the villagers: "The Central Government stipulates that my family should be taken care of." (3) To foreign intellectuals, he said: The May 4th Directive is even more severe than physically eliminating landlords during the civil war. (4) To Party members, such as those he knew relatively well, he would say in words: "We have to struggle like this." To those he knew vaguely, he said: "The Party's policies are excessive." In this land reform study, he looked down on anyone in the group. When making a self-reflection report, he boasted about the wealth of his home and flaunted his "revolutionary" history. At first, he did not answer the questions at all. Later, he added many contradictory labels. For example, he said: "I am a traitor to the landlord class." He also said he was a "landlord element." But he did not reveal his true colors, was not loyal, and was not honest. Later, the group was expanded, and everyone helped him study for a total of four days, but he was still not honest. Therefore, the Study Committee General Assembly decided to hold a general meeting to educate him.

    地主分子翟士贤
    张宗麟同志代表北大文教学院干部第一小组报告翟墨新在这次土改学习中的材料和他的学习态度：
    翟墨新原名翟士贤，武安伯延镇人，今年三十四岁，现在文教院工作，共产党员。父亲翟鸿文，是伯延的“人物头”，是个地主恶霸，常把佃户抓起送官送府。他家有地五百多亩，其中有三百亩是死契，约二百亩是典押的。房子约二百多间，占有全村二分之一，还有花园一座，在开封等地还有好几个店铺。
    翟的母亲是一个极凶恶的妇人，她虐待使女，用烟签戳、用红烙铁烫、饿肚子，翟墨新和他四个妹妹帮助打。据翟自己说共弄死两条人命，还有一个被弄成残废。
    翟家除收租外，家里也雇工种地，对雇工更苛刻，一个最好的工人，一年工资不得多于四十元，而且到年底才给工资。平时虽然工人的父母生病死亡也不得借支一文。十几个雇工住在一间小屋里，与牲口同住，有一次雇工张着口熟睡，他竟尿到雇工口中。
    翟墨新靠着剥削农民的血汗奢侈之极，住大房子，陈设讲究，常年都是香的，不是花香即是香水香。吃的是白面、大米、鱼肉。衣服之多更难统计，他的前妻嫁妆光是被子就有五六十条，皮衣绸衣二三百件。家里喂了六七个好牲口，有轿车、驼骡轿。还喂了许多恶犬看门守夜，平时贫苦老百姓不敢进他家。翟墨新就是在这个家庭长大的。
    他站在地主立场来破坏土改：在开始减租减息政策的时候，他就写信给当地的工作同志，叫照顾他的家庭。
    在土改中他曾四次回家：
    第一次，骑马回家，大摆筵席，一回家就给父亲讨债五千元。给中央局写信说：“为啥要分浮财？”对地主说：“干部还没训练好，训好就不要浮财了。”
    第二、三次都是骑着马耀武扬威回去的，并给一个公安局扣押的大地主方某（为其舅父）说情，还叫方某来北大教书，但未成事实。他又卖好地十七亩，又替妹子作防空洞，藏骡子、金戒指、毛毯等。
    第四次，回家一看，家被斗了，非常生气，问区政委这是怎样搞的。他于是进行倒算，辱骂村干部老牛是特务，县委给群众撑腰，他则看风声不对，就谈起国内外形势，并挑拨干部和群众的关系，对老牛说：“群众要斗争你，我拒绝了。”又卖好地十八亩，留下三座好房子，说给父亲回来住。带出来很多内货，还将一个小丫头菊花带出来，并对他说是给她上学的，实则现在给他抱孩子。而带她出来的动机，据翟说是怕菊花嫁了人斗争他，而且菊花知道一些他家的内货贮藏的地方。
    从家里带出一些浮财如金戒指…………，还想到老丈人家去挖金子，他把受贿的骡子卖了，把手枪托人卖到石门（后被军区没收），把公家牲口拿了作私人生产，他在北大两年享乐共用了十几万元。
    在土改期间他先后放走十个地主，有的到石门，有的到开封。去年人民日报第一次揭露翟士贤“献田”真象时，他大怒，并和同学说报上是客里空。有人叫他反省，他说：“为什么不照顾家？”在干部学习小组会上，强调他父亲是开明人士，可以教育，说是马列主义者。又说：“我犯的罪过，倘若在部队里，不怕什么，至多是警告。但在学校，老头子（指校长）的关难过。”还说：“如开除我党籍，我非上诉不可。”在五四指示之后，他对一个新来的教员说：“现在比内战时肉体消灭地主还利害！”
    他对土改有四种说法：（一）对被斗的反对劳动人民的地主，他说：“干部还没有训练好。”意思是同情地主，觉得干部斗错了。（二）对群众是吓唬。如他对老乡说：“中央规定照顾我家。”（三）对外来知识分子说：五四指示比内战时肉体消灭地主还利害。（四）对党员，如认识比较好的，他就口头上说：“非这样斗不行”。对认识模糊的，他说：“党的政策过火了。”在这次土改学习中，他看不起小组中的任何人，作反省报告时夸耀了一套家中阔气，炫耀他“革命”的历史，最初根本不回答问题，后来加上许多矛盾的帽子。如说：“我是地主阶级的叛徒。”又说是“地主分子。”但不露出真面目，不忠诚，不老实。后将小组扩大，大家帮助他学习，先后共四天，但仍不老实，于是，学委总会就决定开大会来教育他。
