    Northeast Our Army Intensifies Training
    Eastern and Northern Manchuria Units Diligently Practice Politics
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th] Several corps of the Northeast Manchuria Military Region participating in the large-scale training movement, having completed the basic training of the four major techniques, have now universally entered the stage of diligently practicing politics. The Political Department of the Heilongjiang Military Region stipulates that cadres should be rectified before soldiers are trained. For veteran cadres, the main focus is on checking their ideology, work style, and life since coming to the Northeast; for new cadres, in addition to checking their ideology and work style, their historical background is also understood, and they are guided to continue to progress. Those alien elements who cannot be educated are resolutely purged. For intellectuals, except for a small number of children from despotic landlords who have blood feuds with workers and peasants and who are themselves very bad, a policy of transformation is generally adopted, and they are given appropriate work. In some units of the Nenjiang Military Region, the enlarged meeting of the regiment party committee was first held, concentrating on the cadres at the regiment and battalion levels, focusing on rectifying the regiment and demonstrating to the battalion. The battalion concentrates the opinions from below to help rectify the regiment. Then, all the company-level cadres of the regiment are absorbed to focus on rectifying the battalion. After the battalion is finished, the enlarged meeting of the battalion party committee is used as a unit to absorb platoon-level cadres, focusing on rectifying the company, while thoroughly following the mass line, freely promoting democracy, and creating a mass movement. When studying the land reform issue, a certain unit of the Hejiang Military Region organized cadres to go to the countryside in rotation to visit the rural land distribution movement and the living conditions of poor peasants, further inspiring love for soldiers and changing their own work style. Some even voluntarily requested to lower their existing living standards. At the same time, the Songjiang Military Region troops also brought into play the creativity of the masses and launched the "evaluate red and black points" movement, which further enriched the content of criticism and self-criticism. As a result, some companies have created a situation where soldiers automatically manage themselves, promoting everyone to improve politically and technically.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th] The method of recording "red and black points" created by the Third Company of a certain unit of the Songjiang Military Region during the large-scale training movement has been rapidly promoted to various units and has become a mass movement. Initially, the Seventh Squad of this company adopted a scoring method to evaluate training results. Because the soldiers were not used to it, it was changed to drawing red and black circles, with red circles representing advantages and black circles representing disadvantages, which was enthusiastically praised by everyone. Some soldiers also proposed adding blue circles to indicate normalcy. This method was quickly promoted to all squads, creating a movement throughout the company of officers and soldiers striving to earn red points. For this reason, each squad, platoon, and company established a "no omission record book" to record the name, reason, time, and place of the person who earned points. The scope of application of the point recording method is very wide. In addition to being used in technology and tactics, it can be used in politics to record ideology, work style, stand, and life. When recording, a democratic discussion method is adopted, and each point must be judged by everyone to convince everyone. For example, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad of the Third Company was given a black point after the soldiers held a meeting to discuss the results of his poor work style. Wang Weiming, the deputy squad leader of the Seventh Squad, took off his clothes and took the lead in throwing grenades on the training ground, and usually got along with the soldiers without losing his temper, so he was given a red point. Comrades who have been criticized at the meeting must conduct self-criticism and express their determination to work hard to correct themselves. Since the launch of this movement, the enthusiasm of the soldiers and the correct democratic work style have been universally established. Many soldiers have been able to overcome some of the difficulties they encountered in training, and some have corrected their biases ideologically and improved their skills at the same time. Some squads and platoons have truly achieved that everyone consciously abides by discipline and soldiers automatically manage themselves. When there is a problem in the unit, everyone will immediately discover it, making the internal more united and consolidated. In the past, it often took a lot of effort for the company's cadres to go to the squads to understand the situation. Now, as long as they go down and look at the red and black points, they can get a general idea. And the soldiers are bolder and more timely in reporting problems to their superiors than in the past.

    东北我军大练兵
    东满北满各部苦练政治
    【新华社东北十一日电】东北满各军区参与大规模练兵运动的若干兵团，于完成四大技术的基本训练，现已普遍进入苦练政治阶段。黑龙江军区政治部规定先整干部后练战士。对老干部主要是检查其来东北以后的思想作风与生活，对新干部除检查思想作风外，并了解其历史情况，引导其继续进步。对不可教育的异己分子则坚决清洗。对于知识分子，除少数恶霸大地主出身子弟，与工农有杀父之仇，其本人又是很坏的清洗外，一般的均采取改造的方针，并给以适当的工作。嫩江军区有的部队，首由团党委扩大会议，集中团营两级干部，着重整团，对营作示范。营集中下边意见帮助整团。然后再吸收全团连级干部着重整营。营结束后，又以营党委扩大会为单位，吸收排级干部，着重整连，同时并彻底走群众路线，放手发扬民主，造成群众性的运动。合江军区某部在学习土改问题时，曾组织干部轮流下乡，参观农村的平分土地运动与贫苦农民的生活状况，进一步启发了爱兵思想，转变了自己的作风。有的并自动要求降低现有的生活水平。松江军区部队并与此同时发挥了群众的创造性，开展“评红黑点”运动，更加丰富了批评与自我批评的内容。若干连队亦因此造成了战士自动管理自己，推动大家从政治、技术上提高一步。
    【新华社东北十一日电】松江军区某部三连在大练兵运动中创造的记“红黑点”办法已迅速推广各部，成为群众性的运动。最初该连七班为了评定练兵成绩，采取记分办法。因战士们用不惯，便改为画红黑圈，以红圈表示优点，黑圈表示缺点，得到大家热烈赞许。有的战士还提出加画蓝圈，以表示平常。这一办法就很快推广到各班，造成了整个连队指战员的争取记红点运动。各班排和连亦为此立了“点滴不漏簿”，记载得点人的姓名，事由和时间地点。记点办法运用范围很广，除用在技术和战术上外，在政治上可记思想、作风、立场和生活。记时采取民主讨论方式，每记一点须由大家评判，使各人心服。例如三连四班副班长因作风不好，战士们开会评议结果，给他划了个黑点。七班副班长王维明在操场上脱了衣服带头投弹，平时和战士们打成一片不发脾气，就给划个红点。在会上受了批评的同志须进行自我检讨，表示努力改正决心。自开展这一运动后，战士们的积极性和正确的民主作风普遍树立起来，许多战士在练兵中曾碰到的一些困难，也都能自动克服，有的从思想上纠正偏向后同时又提高了技术。某些班排且真正做到了人人自觉的遵守纪律，战士自动的管理自己。部队中一有问题，也都会立即被大家发觉，使内部更加团结和巩固。过去连里的干部要到班里了解情况，往往需要化很多工夫，现在只要一到下面看看红黑点，就能知道个大概，而战士们向上级反映问题，也比过去大胆和及时了。
