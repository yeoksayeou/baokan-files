　　Xidouzhuang Cadres Collectively Study
　　Voluntarily Review Past Mistakes
　　[Taihang News] Cadres in Xidouzhuang, She County, listened to the Party and the masses and began to honestly review their mistakes. They organized a study group to collectively study the Central Bureau's "Letter to Party Members," the Border Region Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee's "Letter to Farmers," and the Border Government's Regulations on Punishing Corruption. While studying, they reflected on their past shortcomings and mistakes. They also put forward slogans such as: "Unburden yourself and hand over to the poor and hired peasants for dismantling, washing, and cleaning," and "Pretending to be clever and trying to be sloppy will never escape the eyes of the masses." After a period of study, they began to review. Zhang Heting, the director of the Farmers' Association from a poor peasant background, reviewed and said: During the land reform movement the year before last, our cadres all wanted to take more when distributing fruits, and there was no way to solve it. Later, district cadre Zhang Fuming spent three days and three nights having each of us pull a good donkey, saying that the masses "supported" it, and that's how the problem was solved. One night, I met public security officer Fan Deqing and political director Fan Youtang (now the manager of the cooperative). Deqing said, "We all want to take more fruit, and we even have disagreements, which is really bad. I think we should open the door of the fruit storage group and all take a few clothes to wear, and that's it." The three of us hit it off, and we pretended to check whether the accounts registered by the storekeeper Fan Yutang were clear, and we tried to get them on our side. We also called two other cadres, a total of eight people, and opened the door of the clothing storage room. We went in, opened the packages, and each of us picked out a set of clothes, stealing the fruits of the masses. I took four cotton coats, and also embezzled forty catties of black beans and a cloth bag. This was a big mistake. After Zhang Heting's review, Fan Youtang also reviewed and said: "I stole a robe and two cotton trousers." Women's Federation Chairman Feng Gaiying also reviewed that she had stolen two mandarin jackets, a pair of floral cotton trousers, and a washbasin. The three storekeepers also made reviews. Minjiao Director Fan Dehe (currently a public security officer) also reviewed that he had stolen a pair of cotton trousers, a shirt, and a bed sheet. They collectively stole the fruits of the masses and were afraid that the masses would find problems when checking the accounts, so Deqing asked the secretary to tear off a page of the fruit account book to confuse the masses. They were also afraid that other cadres who had not stolen would expose them, so they organized a second night-time fruit theft, with a total of ten people, each stealing a piece of clothing. Only then did they feel relieved, and the remaining rotten things were distributed to the masses. Other mistakes are still being reviewed. They are prepared to openly admit their mistakes to the masses during the fair distribution, and sincerely ask the masses to examine them. The masses generally responded well when they heard that the cadres were voluntarily making reviews. Poor peasant Guo Lin said: "We speak the truth and talk about the facts. As long as the cadres turn back and do a good job for the masses, we still want them!" Middle peasant Guo Laifu said: "As long as the cadres take out the stolen and over-occupied fruits and do a good job, we don't necessarily have to replace them."

　　西豆庄干部集体学习
  　自动检讨过去错误
    【太行消息】涉县西豆庄干部听党和群众的话，开始老老实实检讨自己的错误。他们组织了一个学习组，集体学习中央局的“告党员书”、边区农会筹委会的“告农民书”和边府惩治贪污条例等文件。一面学习，一面反省自己过去的缺点和错误。并提出：“有包袱快解开交贫雇拆洗打扫”，“假装聪明想马虎，总出不了群众的手心”等口号。学习了一个时期，就检讨起来了。贫农出身的农会主任张何廷检讨说：前年土地改革运动中，咱干部们在分果实时，都想多分，没办法解决。后来区干部张甫明用了三天三夜，叫咱们每人拉了个好驴，说是群众“拥护”，才算解决了这个问题。有一天夜里，我遇见公安员樊德清、政治主任樊有堂（现合作社经理），德清说：“咱们都想多分点果实，还闹下意见，真不好。我看咱去把保管果实组门弄开，都拿几件衣裳穿穿，就没啥了。”俺三人言投意合，就假借检查保管员樊玉堂登记的帐清不清，生法与他们拉成一气，又叫来两个干部，碰在一块共八个人，将保管衣服的房门弄开，进去拆开包袱，你拣一身，我挑一件，偷取了群众的果实。我拿了四件棉衣，还贪污过四十斤黑豆，一条布袋，这真是大错。张何廷检讨后，樊有堂也检讨说：“我偷过一件袍子、两条棉裤。”妇女会主席冯改英也检讨出偷过两件马褂、一条花棉裤，还偷了个洗脸盆。三个保管员也都作了检讨。民教主任樊德和（现任公安员）也检讨出偷过一条棉裤、一个衫子，一个衬单。他们集体偷了群众的果实，怕群众查帐出岔子，德清就叫书记把果实帐撕掉一张，来迷弄群众。又怕其他没偷的干部说出他们，就又组织了个二次下夜偷果实，共十人，每人偷了一件衣服。这才算放了心，剩下些烂东西分给了群众。其他错误还正在检讨中。他们准备平分时公开向群众承认错误，诚心诚意的叫群众审查。群众听说干部在自动作检讨，一般反映都很好。贫雇郭林的说：“咱们是讲真理谈实话，只要干部回头好好替群众办事，咱还是要他们哩！”中农郭来富说：“干部们只要把偷的与多占的果实拿出来，还好好干工作，咱也不一定要撤换他们。”
