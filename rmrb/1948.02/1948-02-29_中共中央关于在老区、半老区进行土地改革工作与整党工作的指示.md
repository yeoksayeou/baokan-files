　　Instructions of the CCP Central Committee on Land Reform and Party Rectification in Old and Semi-Old Areas
　　(February 22, 1948)

　　(1) According to reports from various regions in recent months, all liberated areas, except for the newly liberated areas since the People's Liberation Army shifted from defense to offense last autumn, should be roughly divided into three categories of regions in all old and semi-old areas, and different work guidelines should be adopted according to the different situations of the three categories of regions.

　　A. The first type of region is where land reform is relatively thorough. Most of these areas have undergone rent reduction and interest reduction, liquidation struggles, and land reform after the May 4th Directive in 1946; some areas have undergone liquidation and land reform; and some areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia have undergone land distribution before 1937 and land return in 1940. In these areas, land has been equally distributed, the feudal system no longer exists, and the average amount of land owned by farmers of all classes is not much different. In terms of class situation, except for the Northeast and other areas where land has not been equally distributed for long, landlords and old-style rich peasants have been greatly reduced compared to the past, and some have even been reduced to working farmers or poor people, but there is still a small number of landlords and old rich peasants who occupy more and better land property. Many working cadres in these areas occupy more and better land property. New rich peasants have grown up in these areas, and there are more than old rich peasants. Middle peasants have developed into the majority in these areas, accounting for about 50 to 80 percent of the rural population, of which new middle peasants account for a large number, reaching more than half. The average amount of land owned by middle peasants generally exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by about one-half. Poor and hired peasants have become a minority, accounting for about 10 to 40 percent, of which some have not yet completely turned over, and some have been reduced from landlords and old rich peasants to poor peasants. These areas should be considered as having already equally distributed land, and there is absolutely no need to redistribute it. The remaining problem is to adjust land and some other means of production in a smaller scope by means of replenishment, so that poor and hired peasants who have not yet completely turned over can be supplemented with land and other necessary means of production from the families of landlords, old rich peasants, especially cadres who occupy much more land property than farmers. If it is necessary to extract land from new rich peasants or even some wealthy middle peasants, the consent of the extractees must be obtained before it can be moved. The typical experience of Huangjiachuan in Suide (broadcast by Xinhua News Agency) can be roughly applied to this type of region.

　　B. The second type of region is where land reform is not thorough enough. Among them, some areas have undergone rent reduction and interest reduction, liquidation struggles, and land reform after the May 4th Directive; other areas have undergone liquidation and land reform, but due to various reasons, such as wavering leadership policies, impurity within the party, bureaucracy, commandism, and war conditions, the equal distribution of land is not thorough enough, there are still remnants of the feudal system, and the average amount of land owned by farmers of all classes varies greatly. In terms of class situation, there are more landlords and old rich peasants than in the first type of region, and most of them still occupy more and better land property. Many working cadres occupy more and better land property. There are not many new rich peasants. Middle peasants account for a minority of the population, about 20 to 40 percent, of which new middle peasants also account for a minority. The average amount of land owned by middle peasants generally exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by about one time due to the result of land transfer caused by rent reduction and liquidation. Poor and hired peasants still account for the majority, from 50 to 70 percent, of which the majority have not yet completely turned over. These areas should be considered as having basically implemented equal distribution, but not thoroughly. Therefore, in general, it is not to carry out a comprehensive equal distribution again, but to implement adjustment within a larger scope. Only in certain special places, under the condition that the majority of farmers require and obtain the consent of the middle peasants, should it be redistributed. Because the number of poor and hired peasants in this type of region is the largest and the average land difference is large, moving only the land property of landlords, old rich peasants, and cadres generally cannot meet the requirements of poor and hired peasants, and it is inevitable to extract land from new rich peasants and some middle peasants. Therefore, if the average amount of land owned by middle peasants exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by about one time, a part of the land of middle peasants can be extracted after obtaining their consent, but not more than two-fourths of their total land. In this way, on the one hand, the fluctuation of middle peasants can be reduced, and on the other hand, the average amount of land owned by middle peasants can still be preserved to exceed the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants, but the difference should not be too large. If the average amount of land owned by middle peasants exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by more than one time and agrees to equal distribution, equal distribution can be implemented. In this type of region, the working methods of land reform workers described in the experience of Huangjiachuan in Suide must also be paid attention to and adopted.

　　C. The third type of region is where land reform is very incomplete. Among them, some areas have also undergone liquidation and land reform, but the work is very bad. Other areas are border areas or recovered areas, and land reform work has not yet been carried out. In all these areas, land has not been equally distributed, the feudal system still exists, land relations and class situations have only undergone some changes, landlords and old rich peasants still occupy a large amount of land property, and poor and hired peasants are still numerous with little land. In these areas, the policy of equally distributing land and completely eliminating the feudal system is fully applicable. The focus of equal distribution should be on confiscating the land property of landlords and requisitioning the surplus land property of rich peasants. For the surplus land of some middle peasants, it can only be extracted and equally distributed after obtaining their consent. If the land owned by some middle peasants only exceeds the average amount of land owned by general farmers by less than 10 percent, it should not be changed. Border areas, if still guerrilla in nature, should be treated as new areas, and the central government's regulations on the main points of land reform in new areas should be applied, and should not be included in this type of area.

　　(2) Whether it is equally distributing land or adjusting land, not only should attention be paid to the difference in the quantity of land, but also to the difference in the quality, yield, and distance of the land; not only should the general cultivated land in rural areas be considered, but also public land, wasteland, black land, land of childless households, etc.; especially illegally seized land property, unfairly distributed land property, and fruits of corruption or encroachment by cadres should be given priority to solving. In this way, the policy of extracting more to compensate less and extracting fertile to compensate barren can be truly realized, and the requirements of poor and hired peasants can be met from many aspects, while at the same time taking care of the interests of middle peasants. In the equal distribution or adjustment of land, it is very important to fully explain the reasons and obtain the consent of the new rich peasants and middle peasants when extracting their land. If they do not agree, they should be conceded to and not be forced.

　　(3) In order to meet the requirements of poor and hired peasants, when implementing land adjustment, priority should be given to supplementing the poor and hired peasants who lack land. Then, for single young adults with complete labor force, they should be supplemented with two shares of land, but if the land is insufficient, they can also be supplemented with less than two shares of land, or not supplemented. For the lonely elderly and widows, because they lack labor force, if the land is insufficient, they can also not be supplemented with two shares of land. For families with many family members, they can also be supplemented less than families with fewer family members. For those with deep rogue habits who are difficult to change for a while, they can also be supplemented less, later, or not supplemented. For such rogues, they should only be given the right to use the land temporarily, not the right to own the land. For those who have recently been reduced from landlords and rich peasants to poor and hired peasants, they can also be supplemented later or not supplemented. In short, we must enable the broad masses of poor and hired peasants to rationally supplement land to benefit production, and should not echo the erroneous idea of absolute egalitarianism. After the land adjustment, for the lonely elderly and widows and poor and hired peasants who still have difficulties that cannot be solved, the government should find other ways to help them solve their difficulties.

　　(4) In the first and second types of regions, in places where farmers have been mobilized and organized, the above provisions should be followed, and the adjustment should be completed before the spring plowing to determine land rights to benefit production. In places where the work has not been done well and it is estimated that the land reform task cannot be completed before the spring plowing, the land reform work should be postponed to after the summer, and it should be guaranteed that this year's land production will belong to the tillers, and the work should be quickly turned to production, party rectification, and the establishment of rural democratic life. In the first and second types of regions, where the work of land adjustment has been done well, land rights should be determined and no longer changed. In the third type of region, the land reform work that has already started should be quickly brought to an end and postponed to after the summer to be carried out again, so as to quickly turn to production and general propaganda and organization work.

　　(5) In the old and semi-old areas, we should prepare to complete the land reform and party rectification tasks in the entire region in a planned way in two to three years (1948 to 1950), and should not be too hasty, resulting in many unnecessary problems. Land reform work and party rectification work are both very meticulous mass work, and the speed of the work must be determined according to the degree of awareness and organization of the masses and the number and strength of leading cadres. The solution of land reform and party rectification problems in each village must be fully deliberated and obtain the consent of the vast majority of people before a decision can be made and action can be taken. It cannot be forcibly resolved by a few people, resulting in the error of commandism. At the same time, for the incorrect opinions that occur among the masses, we must patiently persuade them to realize the leading role of the party, and do not commit the error of tailism.

　　(6) Land reform and party rectification should both adopt the method of wave-like gradual promotion with emphasis. In places where there are no capable leaders or sound work groups, it is better to postpone the launch than to rush for success, resulting in detours. However, in all places where it is decided to launch work, we must concentrate our efforts and complete the work plan on time, and do not delay for too long, which will reduce the enthusiasm of the masses, hinder production, and be unfavorable to the promotion of work. All leaders and work groups leading land reform and party rectification work must be trained, explain the policies, and check their work in a timely manner.

　　(7) The poor peasant leagues are undoubtedly the backbone organization of the peasant masses who resolutely implement land reform and completely eliminate the feudal system. However, in the first type of region where equal distribution has been realized and middle peasants account for the majority, if we also artificially organize poor peasant leagues to lead everything, we will inevitably be separated from the majority and isolate ourselves. Therefore, in these areas, the original farmers' associations should be expanded and the committees of the farmers' associations should be re-elected to enable them to lead various tasks. Where there are no farmers' associations, farmers' associations should be established. In the farmers' associations, poor and hired peasant groups should be established. If poor peasant leagues have already been organized, they should not be immediately announced to be abolished, but the poor peasant leagues should be gradually changed to poor and hired peasant groups in the farmers' associations. In the second type of region, because the equal distribution is not thorough enough, poor and hired peasants still account for the majority, and the independent leading role of the poor peasant leagues has not been lost. Therefore, poor peasant leagues should be organized and made to play a leading role among the farmers, but when organizing, new middle peasants should be absorbed to participate. After the poor peasant leagues are established for a short period of time (such as one or two months), the original farmers' associations should be expanded and the committees of the farmers' associations should be re-elected to enable them to lead various tasks. Where there are no farmers' associations, farmers' associations should be established. After the land adjustment work is completed, the poor peasant leagues can be changed to poor and hired peasant groups. If, in the past land reform, there have been sound farmers' associations led by poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants, or there are smooth conditions to ensure that the committees of the farmers' associations are re-elected to enable poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants to account for two-thirds of the sound leadership to implement land reform work, poor peasant leagues can also not be organized, and only poor and hired peasant groups can be organized in the farmers' associations. In the third type of region, because the equal distribution has not been implemented, the majority of poor and hired peasants have not turned over, and middle peasants still have a wait-and-see attitude towards land reform, we must first organize poor peasant leagues, launch land reform struggles, establish leadership prestige, and after a period of time (such as three or four months), establish farmers' associations including all farmers. Farmers' associations should allow new rich peasants to join, but landlords, old rich peasants, and all speculators should be resolutely refused to join. In all places, after the land reform work and party rectification work are generally completed, general elections should be implemented to establish village people's congresses and re-elect village governments. In the committees of the farmers' associations, in the village people's congresses and government committees, generally, poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants should jointly account for two-thirds, and old middle peasants and other working people should account for one-third.

　　(8) Party rectification work is being carried out in various places and has created many methods. Among them, the method of inviting non-party masses to participate in party meetings and jointly review party members and cadres through party branches is the most sound method. The typical experience of Pingshan County should be taken as a model by various places. In the first and second types of regions, the general feudal forces have been eliminated, and the dissatisfaction of the peasants is often concentrated on a group of party members and cadres who use their political status to do evil and encroach on the fruits of land reform. Therefore, carrying out the work of land adjustment in these areas must be combined with party rectification work, and sometimes it must start from party rectification in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Adopting the above-mentioned party rectification method of combining party members and non-party masses in meetings, on the one hand, allows the non-party masses participating in the meetings to fully criticize and review the party members and cadres they oppose or support, making them feel that they have communicated with Chairman Mao's party; on the other hand, the party leaders can comprehensively consider the problems based on the opinions of the masses and the situation within the party, distinguish between right and wrong, give fair treatment that should be punished and rewarded, and make both party members and non-party masses feel satisfied; at the same time, they can also absorb the activists who are recommended or supported by the masses to join the party organization. In this way, not only will the party's ranks be rectified, but also the masses' ranks will be rectified, and a democratic life inside and outside the party will be established, which will greatly increase the party's prestige. This method should be implemented in rural areas, in cities, in factories, in the army, in organs, and in schools. Except for the newly consolidated areas, all party branches should be open. All party branches should have non-party masses participate in all meetings that discuss issues related to the interests of the masses, including party criticism and self-criticism meetings, and should not hold secret meetings, in order to break the masses' mysterious feeling about the party's organization and party meetings, expose all the good and bad phenomena within the party to the masses, and be supervised, criticized or supported by the masses. The implementation of this method requires two conditions, one is the soundness of the leadership of the superior party, and the other is that the branch must have several good party member backbones. If the leadership of the leaders of the superior party is not sound, the leadership must be sound first. If certain branches have indeed been ruled by bad elements, or even completely occupied by bad elements, and there are no good party member backbones and it is impossible to carry out transformation, the branch should be dissolved, and the superior leaders should go beyond the organization, directly mobilize the masses, and rely on the poor peasant leagues, poor and hired peasant groups, and farmers' associations to lead land reform and production. After a period of time, re-absorb party members and establish branches. For the party members of the original branch, after the branch is announced to be dissolved, the leaders of the superior party may submit them to the poor peasant league congress or farmer congress for criticism and review according to the situation, and give them the punishment they deserve. Among them, those who are judged by the masses to have committed lighter errors, after a certain period of observation and proof that they have indeed corrected, can still have their party membership restored individually. But this refers to special circumstances. In general, branches always have some good party members. The responsibility of the superior leaders lies in being good at discovering these good party members, relying on them as the backbone, absorbing fresh forces, and transforming the branches, rather than abandoning or ignoring them. Party rectification and cadre review must adopt a serious and cautious attitude. We must not only seriously pay attention to the impure phenomena within the party, but also not forget that the overall situation of our party has been tested for a long time, has great prestige among the masses, and is advancing victoriously. It should be admitted that in the process of war and land reform, a group of class alien elements will inevitably be purged from the party, and at the same time, a large number of revolutionary activists will inevitably flood into the party. Therefore, the party committees of various places should solve the problems separately according to the situation in the party rectification work. Those who have obviously committed serious crimes and have lost the minimum qualifications as a party member should be expelled from the party. Those class alien elements who have infiltrated the party, and those incorrigible degenerates within the party, should be resolutely purged from the party. For those intellectuals or other elements within the party who come from the exploiting class but voluntarily give up their original class position, when they have committed serious mistakes but have not lost the minimum qualifications as a party member, as long as they admit their mistakes, are willing to correct their mistakes, and obtain the consent of the non-party masses, we should adopt an attitude of observation and education, and should not immediately expel them from the party. For party members who have committed minor mistakes, regardless of their origin, the policy of education should be adopted.

　　中共中央关于在老区、半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示
    （一九四八年二月二十二日）
    （一）根据各地最近数月的报告看来，各解放区，除了去年秋季人民解放军由防御转入进攻以后解放的新区以外，在所有老区与半老区中，大致应分为三类地区，并应根据三类地区的不同的情况，采取不同的工作方针。
    甲、第一类地区，是土地改革较为彻底的地区。其中，大多数地区，是经过了减租减息、清算斗争和一九四六年五四指示以后的土地改革；一部分地区，经过了清算和土地改革；而陕甘宁的一部分地区则经过了一九三七以前的分地及一九四○年的归地。在这些地区，土地已经平分，封建制度已不存在，农民各阶层占有土地的平均数相差不多。阶级情况，除了东北及其他平分不久的地区尚有不同外，地主与旧式富农均比过去大为减少，且有已下降为劳动农民或贫民者，但尚有一小部分地主旧富农占有较多较好的土地财产。这类地区的工作干部有许多人占有较多较好的土地财产。这类地区，新富农已经生长，且有多过旧富农者。中农在这类地区已发展为多数，从乡村人口的百分之五十到八十上下，其中，新中农占很大数量，有达一半以上者。中农所有土地的平均数，一般超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数约二分之一上下。贫雇农变为少数，从百分之十到四十上下，其中尚有若干未彻底翻身者，亦有由地主旧富农下降为贫农者。这类地区，应被认为土地已经平分，决无再行平分的必要。留下的问题是在较小的范围内，用抽补方法调剂土地及一部分其他生产资料，使尚未彻底翻身的贫雇农从地主旧富农尤其是占有超过农民很多的土地财产的干部家庭那里补进土地及其他必需的生产资料。如果需要抽出新富农甚至一部分富裕中农的土地时，必须取得被抽者的同意，方可抽动。绥德黄家川的典型经验（即由新华社广播），可以大致应用于这类地区。
    乙、第二类地区，是土地改革尚不彻底的地区。其中，一部分地区，经过了减租减息，清算斗争与五四指示后的土改；另一部分地区，经过了清算和土改，但均由于各种原因，例如领导方针动摇，党内不纯，官僚主义，命令主义及战争情况等，致使土地平分尚不彻底，封建制度尚有残余，农民各阶层占有土地的平均数相差较大。阶级情况，地主旧富农较第一类地区为多，大都仍占有较多较好的土地财产。工作干部中许多人占有较多较好的土地财产。新富农尚不多。中农占人口的少数，约为百分之二十到四十上下其中新中农亦占少数。中农所有土地的平均数，因减租清算致土地转移的结果，一般超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数达一倍上下。贫雇农仍占多数，从百分之五十到七十上下，其中多数尚未彻底翻身。这类地区，应被认为平分已大体实施，但不彻底。因此，一般地也不是再来一次全面的平分，而是实行在较大范围内的调剂。只在某些特殊地方，在多数农民要求并取得中农同意的条件之下，应当重新平分。由于这类地区贫雇农人数最多而土地平均差额又较大，单动地主旧富农及干部的土地财产，一般不能满足贫雇农的要求，势非抽动新富农及一部分中农的土地不可。因此，凡中农所有土地的平均数超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数在一倍上下者，在取得本人同意以后，可以抽出中农的一部分土地，但以不超过其全部土地的四分之二为限度。如此，一方面可使中农波动面不致太大，另一方面仍可保存中农所有土地的平均数超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数，但又不致相差太大。如果中农所有土地的平均数超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数在一倍以上，并赞成平分时，可以实行平分。在这类地区，绥德黄家川经验中所述土改工作人员的工作方法，亦必须注意采用。
    丙、第三类地区，是土地改革很不彻底的地区。其中，一部分地区虽然也经过了清算和土改，但是工作很坏。另一部分地区，则是边沿区或收复区，土改工作尚未进行。所有这些地区，土地并未平分，封建制度依然存在，土地关系及阶级情况仅有若干变动，地主旧富农仍占有大量的土地财产，贫雇农仍然是人多地少。在这类地区，完全适用平分土地彻底消灭封建制度的方针。平分的重点，应放在没收地主土地财产及征收富农多余的土地财产上面。对于一部分中农的多余土地，必须在取得其同意以后，方能抽出平分。如果某些中农所有土地较一般农民所有土地的平均数只超出百分之十以下者，应不变动。边沿区，如尚带游击性质，应作新区看待，适用中央关于新区土改要点的规定，不应列入此类地区。
    （二）不论是平分土地或调剂土地，不但应注重土地数量的差别，还应注重土地的质量、产量及其位置远近的差别；不但应从农村的一般耕地着眼，还应从公地、荒地、黑地、绝户地等着眼；尤其是非法强占的土地财产，分配不公的土地财产及干部贪污或侵占的果实，更应首先注意解决。如此，才能真正实现抽多补少、抽肥补瘦的平分方针，才能从多方面设法满足贫雇农的要求，而同时又照顾了中农的利益。在平分或调剂土地中，对于在抽动新富农及中农的土地时必须充分说明理由取得本人同意一点，甚为重要。如果本人不同意，则应向他们让步，不得采取强制办法。
    （三）为着满足贫雇农的要求，在实行调剂土地时，应首先补足缺地较多的贫雇农。然后，才对于有完全劳动力的青壮年单身汉，补足其两人份的土地，但如土地不足时，亦可补给较两人份为少的土地，或者不补。对于孤老寡妇，因其缺乏劳动力，在土地不足时，亦可不补给两人份的土地。对家庭人口多的，亦可较家庭人口少的少补。对流氓习气很深一时难望改好者，也可少补，后补，或不补。对于此种流氓，暂时应只给与土地使用权，不给予土地所有权。对于由地主富农下降的贫雇农为时不久者，亦可后补，或不补。总之，要使广大贫雇农群众能合理地补足土地，以利生产，而不应附和绝对平均主义的错误思想。在调剂土地以后，对于孤老寡妇及贫雇农中仍有困难不能解决者，政府应另行设法帮助其解决困难。
    （四）在第一第二两类地区中，在农民已经发动和组织起来的地方，目前应依上述各项规定，于春耕前实行调剂完毕，确定地权，以利生产。在工作尚未做好估计春耕前已不可能完成土改任务的地方，即应将土改工作推迟至夏季以后进行，并保证今年的土地生产物归耕者所有，而将工作迅速转入生产、整党和建立乡村民主生活上去。在第一第二两类地区中，调剂土地的工作已经做好的地方，即应确定地权，不再变动。在第三类地区中，更应将已着手的土改工作赶快作一结束，推迟至夏季以后重新进行，以便迅速转入生产及一般的宣传组织工作。
    （五）在老区半老区，应准备以二年到三年时间（一九四八年至一九五零年）有计划地完成全区域的土改与整党任务，而不应操之过急，致发生许多不应有的毛病。土改工作与整党工作，均是很细致的群众工作，必须依据群众的觉悟程度与组织程度，领导干部的多少强弱，决定工作的速度。每一个乡村土改与整党问题的解决，均必须酝酿成熟，取得绝大多数人的同意，方能作出决定，采取行动，不能由少数人强制解决，致犯命令主义的错误。同时，对于群众中发生的不正确意见，又必须耐心说服，实现党的领导作用，不要犯尾巴主义的错误。
    （六）土改与整党，均应采取有重点的波浪式的逐步推广的方法。凡无得力的领导者或健全的工作团的地方，宁可暂缓发动，不要急于求成，致走弯路。但是在一切决定发动工作的地方，又要集中力量，按期完成工作计划，不要拖延太久，致使群众情绪减低，既碍生产，又不利于工作的推进。对于一切领导土改与整党工作的领导者及工作团，均必须加以训练，讲明政策，并要适时地检查他们的工作。
    （七）贫农团无疑是农民群众中坚决实行土地改革彻底消灭封建制度的骨干组织。但是在第一类地区平分已经实现、中农已占多数的情况下，如果也要人为地组织贫农团去领导一切，势必脱离多数，孤立自己。因此，在这类地区，应就原有的农会加以扩充，并改选农会的委员会，使其能领导各项工作。原来无农会者，应成立农会。在农会中，成立贫雇农小组。如果贫农团已经组织起来，则不应马上宣布取消，而应使贫农团逐渐改为农会中的贫雇农小组。在第二类地区，因为平分尚不彻底，贫雇农仍占多数，贫农团的独立领导作用尚未失去，因此应该组织贫农团，并使其在农民中起领导作用，但在组织时，应吸收新中农参加。在贫农团成立一个短时期（例如一二个月）以后，即应就原有农会加以扩充，改选农会的委员会，使其能领导各项工作。原来无农会者，即应成立农会。在土地调剂工作完成以后，贫农团即可改为贫雇农小组。如果在过去土地改革中业已成立有贫雇农及新中农领导的健全的农会，或者有顺利条件能够保证改选农会的委员会使贫雇农及新中农占三分之二实施土改工作的健全领导的地方，亦可不组织贫农团，而只于农会中组织贫雇农小组。在第三类地区，因为平分尚未实施，贫雇农占多数尚未翻身，中农对土改尚存观望心理，必须首先组织贫农团，发动土改斗争，树立领导威信，一个时期（例如三四个月）以后，再成立包括全体农民在内的农会。农会应容许新富农入会，但对地主、旧富农及一切投机分子，则应坚决拒绝其入会。在一切地方，在土改工作与整党工作大致完成以后，即应实行普选，成立乡村人民代表大会，并改选乡村政府，在农会的委员会中，在乡村人民代表大会及政府委员会中，一般地贫雇农新中农应合占三分之二，旧中农及其他劳动分子应占三分之一。
    （八）各地整党工作正在开展，并创造了许多方法。其中，以经过党的支部，邀集党外群众参加党的会议，共同审查党员及干部的方法，为最健全的方法。平山县的典型经验，应为各地所取法。在第一第二类地区，一般的封建势力业已消灭，而农民中的不满常常集中于一批利用政治地位为非作恶、侵占土改果实的党员及干部身上。因此，在这些地区进行调剂土地的工作，必须与整党工作相结合，有时还须从整党开始，才能发动群众的积极性。采用上述党员与党外群众结合开会的整党方法，一方面，使参加会议的党外群众能够尽情地批判与审查他们所反对的或赞成的党员及干部，使他们感觉到他们已与毛主席的党通了气；另方面，党的领导者又可根据群众意见及党内情况，全面地考虑问题，分别是非轻重，给以应罚应奖的公平的处置，使党内外群众均感觉满意；同时，又可以吸收被群众所推荐的或拥护的积极分子加入党的组织。如此，既整顿了党的队伍，又整顿了群众的队伍，建立起党内外的民主生活，将极大地提高党的威信。此种方法，在农村中，在城市中，在工厂中，在军队中，在机关和学校中，均应实行。除尚未巩固的新区以外，一切党的支部，均应公开。一切党的支部，在其讨论有关群众利益的问题的一切会议上，包括党的批评检讨会议在内，均应有党外群众参加，不许开秘密会议，借以破除群众对党的组织与党的会议的神秘感觉，使党内一切好的与坏的现象暴露于群众之前，为群众所监督，为群众所批评或拥护。实行这种方法，需要两个条件，一个是上级党的领导的健全，一个是本支部要有几个好的党员骨干。如果上级党的领导者的领导不健全，便须先健全领导。如果某些支部确已为坏分子所统治，甚或全部为坏分子所盘据，没有好的党员骨干，无法进行改造时，就应解散这个支部，上级领导者就应超过该组织，直接动员群众，依靠贫农团、贫雇农小组及农会，领导土改与生产。这样经过一个时期之后，重新吸收党员，建立支部。对于原支部的党员，在该支部被宣布解散以后，上级党的领导者得依情况将他们提交贫农团大会或农民大会予以批判和审查，并给以应得的处分。其中，经群众评定认为错误较轻的分子，经过一定时期的考察，证明其确已改正者，仍可个别地恢复党籍。但这是指特殊的情况。一般的支部，总有若干好党员。上级领导者的责任，就在善于发现这些好党员，并依靠他们为骨干，吸收新鲜力量，改造支部，而不要抛弃或不理他们。整党审干，必须采取严肃而又谨慎的态度。我们既要严肃地注视党内不纯的现象，又要勿忘我党的整个情况是业已经过长期考验，在群众中有了极大威信，并正在胜利前进中。应当承认，在战争和土改的过程中，一定会有一批阶级异己分子从党内清洗出去，同时又一定会有大批的革命积极分子涌进党来。因此，各地党委在整党工作中，应当分别情况，解决问题。对于那些显然犯有重大罪恶、业已丧失作为一个党员的起码资格的分子，应当开除出党。对于那些混进党内的阶级异己分子，对于那些不可救药的党内蜕化分子，均应坚决清洗出党。对于那些虽然是从剥削阶级出身但是自愿放弃其原来的阶级立场的党内的知识分子或其他分子，在他们犯有严重错误，但尚未丧失当作一个党员的起码资格的时候，只要他们承认错误，愿意改正错误，并获得党外群众同意，我们就应采取考察和教育的态度，而不要马上开除出党。对于那些犯有较轻错误的党员，不谕其出身如何，均应采取教育方针。
