Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 24th: Prague Dispatch: 200,000 people held a mass meeting in Prague's City Hall Square on the 21st to oppose the three reactionary parties' conspiracy to sabotage the republic. Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czech Communist Party and Premier of the Cabinet, addressed the cheering masses, denouncing the Czech National Socialist Party (with two cabinet members), the Christian People's Party (with three cabinet members), and the Slovak Democratic Party (with three cabinet members). He stated that with the support of foreign reactionaries, they were attempting to prevent the passage of the democratic constitution and to sever the friendship between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, aiming to turn the country into a center for anti-Czech and anti-Soviet foreign espionage activities. According to recent reports, Interior Minister Nossek and Defense Minister Svoboda, after discovering foreign spies and treasonous activities within the country, ordered the military and police to take certain emergency measures. The aforementioned reactionary parties immediately opposed this, demanding in the State Council with a majority (out of 20 cabinet members, the Czech Communist Party held seven seats) that Nossek and Svoboda cease the aforementioned actions. The latter considered this suggestion a violation of the constitution and firmly rejected it. The cabinet members of the three parties then used this as an excuse to submit their resignations to President Beneš on the 20th, attempting to force Beneš to dissolve the parliament and then, taking advantage of the chaotic political situation, launch an anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and anti-people armed rebellion. In his speech, Gottwald demanded that Beneš accept the resignations of the three parties' cabinet members, resolutely stating, "We will never let them return to the cabinet, and we will never put the police in the hands of the reactionaries." He also called for the establishment of a new people's democratic National Front, demanding that "democratic and progressive figures who have already been proven from worker-peasant mass organizations and various national groups succeed the vacated posts of the resigned ministers." Gottwald concluded by calling on "all Czech and Slovak people to raise their vigilance and preparedness, and to nip in the bud all provocative attempts by the reactionaries." He then shouted, "Long live the democratic people's Czechoslovak Republic!" "Long live the Czechoslovak-Soviet alliance!" Gottwald's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic cheers. The 200,000 people unanimously passed a resolution stating, "We earnestly request Beneš to accept the resignations of the three parties' cabinet members! We want a new Gottwald cabinet without reactionary elements!" After the meeting, the masses held a grand demonstration. As the demonstrators passed the central organ newspaper "Free Speech" of the National Socialist Party, which launched this anti-security agency movement, they shouted, "Close down Free Speech!"

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 26th: Prague Dispatch: National Front Action Committees have been formally established throughout Czechoslovakia in response to the joint call of Premier Gottwald and the Central Council of Trade Unions. Action Committees across the country have passed resolutions demanding that President Beneš accept the resignations of the ministers of the three reactionary parties and that individuals who can gain the trust of the people nationwide and quell all reactionary conspiracies participate in the Gottwald government. At the same time, the Liaison Committee of the all-Slovak resistance movement military organizations issued a declaration making the same request to President Beneš, stating, "The leaders of the Slovak Democratic Party should not only resign from the positions of ministers in the central government, but must also resign from their positions in various Slovak administrative organs, especially the Administrative Committee and the Administrative Group." After days of intense debate, the Executive Committee of the Czech Social Democratic Party agreed on the 23rd by majority vote to the demands in the Czech Communist Party Central Committee's letter of the 21st. The demand was to immediately establish a government based on the cooperation of the Czech Communist Party, the Slovak Communist Party, and the Social Democratic Party, with the broad participation of new figures loyal to people's democracy. In other news, the Czech Paper Industry Workers' Union has unanimously resolved not to supply the reactionary National Socialist Party's "Free Speech" newspaper with newsprint.

　　捷京廿万群众大会
    反对三反动政党破坏共和国
  　捷总理呼吁成立新民族阵线
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】布拉格讯：布拉格二十万群众二十一日在市政厅广场举行大会，反对三反动政党破坏共和国的阴谋。捷共主席内阁总理哥特瓦尔德向欢呼的群众发表演说，痛斥捷克民族社会党（有阁员二名），基督教人民党（有阁员三名），斯洛伐克民主党（有阁员三名），在外国反动分子支持下，力图阻止民主宪法的表决，并力图截断捷克与苏联间的友谊，要把我国变成一个反捷反苏的外国特务活动中心。按最近内政部长诺西克与国防部长斯沃波达，因发现国内有外国特务与叛国活动，曾下令军警采取若干紧急措施，上述反动党派即起而反对，在国务会议中以多数（内阁阁员共二十名捷共占七名）要求诺西克与斯沃波达停止上述行动，后者当认此一建议为违背宪法而予以严正拒绝，三党阁员即以此为借口，于二十日向总统贝奈斯提出辞呈，企图逼迫贝氏解散国会，然后趁纷乱的政治局势，发动反共反苏反人民的武装叛乱。哥特瓦尔德在演说中要求贝奈斯接受三党阁员的辞呈，坚决表示“决不让他们再回到内阁中来，决不把警察放到反动派手中。并呼吁成立新的人民民主的民族阵线，要求“以工农群众组织与各民族团体中业已证明为民主进步的人物，继任已辞职各部长的遗缺。”哥氏最后号召“全体捷克与斯洛伐克人民，提高警觉与戒备，在反动派一切挑衅企图刚见萌芽之时，就与以一举扑灭。”并高呼：“民主的人民的捷克斯拉夫共和国万岁！”“捷苏联盟万岁！”哥氏的演说一再为热烈的欢呼所中断，二十万群众一致通过决议称：“我们以全力恳请贝奈斯接受三党阁员辞呈！我们要一个没有反动分子的哥特瓦尔德新内阁！”会后群众并举行盛大示威游行。示威者经过发动这次反治安机关运动的民族社会党中央机关报“自由言论”报时，高呼“封闭自由言论报”。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布拉格讯：民族阵线行动委员会已在捷克全国各地正式成立，以响应总理哥特瓦尔德与职工会中央委员会的联合号召。各地行动委员会都通过决议，要求贝奈斯总统接受三反动政党各部长的辞呈，并以能获全国人民信任与能敉平一切反动阴谋的人物参加哥特瓦尔德政府。同时全斯洛伐克抵抗运动军事组织的联络委员会，发表宣言，向贝奈斯总统提出同样要求，并称：“斯洛伐克民主党领袖不但应该辞去中央政府部长职位，还必须同样辞去斯洛伐克各行政机关特别是行政委员会和行政团中的职位。”捷克社会民主党执行委员会于连日激烈争辩后，已在二十三日以多数表决同意捷共中央二十一日公函中的要求。按该要求为立即成立以捷共、斯洛伐克共产党与社会民主党合作为基础，并有忠于人民民主的新人物广泛参加的政府。另讯，捷克纸业工人工会已一致决议不供给反动的民族社会党“自由言论”报以白报纸。
