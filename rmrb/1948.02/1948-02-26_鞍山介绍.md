　　Introduction to Anshan
    Anshan is located 120 miles south of Shenyang, situated on the southern section of the Changchun Railway between Liaoyang and Haicheng. It is the site of one of the largest steel plants in the Far East, known as the "Steel Capital," "Iron Capital," and the "Treasure of Manchurian Industry." Its iron reserves amount to 600 million tons, accounting for 75% of the total iron ore reserves in Northeast China. It is said that as early as 1,300 years ago, when Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin, campaigned against Goguryeo and was stationed in Liaoyang, he manufactured weapons near Anshan. In August 1909, the Japanese invaders sent Chutaro Kido, director of the South Manchuria Railway Geological Survey, to conduct an investigation. In April 1915, the Japanese established the Anshan Iron and Steel Works here. After the "September 18th Incident" when the Japanese invaders occupied Northeast China, it was renamed Showa Steel Works in June 1932, which the Japanese called the "foundation of Manchuria's heavy industry." The Japanese invaders regarded it as the "forefront of national policy projects" in their military industrial production for the invasion of China. Centered around the steel plant, within a radius of 25 li, there are eleven mining areas, including Cherry Orchard, Wangjiabaozi, East Anshan, Central-West Anshan, Dagushan, and Guanmenshan. In addition to iron ore, there are also large quantities of limestone, refractory clay, silica, and magnesite. After the Japanese invaders' so-called two phases of "increased production plans," the annual output of pig iron in 1936 reached 400,000 tons and steel 500,000 tons. At the same time, foundries, refractory industries, zinc, steel pipes, and cast iron industries were also established. The Showa Steel Works formed the center of the so-called "steel production bloc of Manchuria's powerful strength" (i.e., a steel monopoly group). In 1937, the Japanese invaders continued to invest and expand operations, totaling 100 million yen, with a planned annual output of 700,000 tons of pig iron and 500,000 tons of steel. In 1938, the capital was increased to 200 million yen. After our army liberated Anshan, it not only removed another important satellite stronghold on the periphery of Shenyang militarily, but also severely struck the military heavy industrial production of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits economically.

　　鞍山介绍
    鞍山位于沈阳南一百二十里，地处中长路南段辽阳与海城之间，为远东最大炼钢厂之一的所在地，有“钢都”、“铁都”及“满洲工业之宝”之称。铁的蕴藏量达六万万吨，占全东北铁矿总藏量的百分之七十五。据说远在一千三百年前，唐李世民远征高丽，驻札辽阳时，即曾于鞍山附近制铁作战器。一九零九年八月日寇曾派满铁地质调查所长木户忠太郎进行勘查，一九一五年四月，日寇即于此设立鞍山制钢所。“九一八”日寇侵占东北后，于一九三二年六月改为昭和制钢所，日寇称之为“满洲重工业的根干”之首，日寇在侵华军工生产上，更目为“国策事业第一线”。该地以炼钢厂为中心，在二十五里为半径的周围地区内，共有樱桃园、王家堡子、东鞍山、中西鞍山、大孤山及关门山等十一个矿区。除铁矿外，并有大量石灰石、耐火土硅石、苦土矿等。经过日寇所谓两期“增产计划”，一九三六年年产铣铁达四十万吨、钢材五十万吨，同时又设立铸钢所、耐火工业、亚铅、钢管、铸铁等重工业。以昭和制钢所为中心形成所谓“满洲强大力量的钢铁生产布洛克”（即钢铁垄断集团）。一九三七年，日寇继续投资扩大经营，总额为一万万日元，计划年产铣铁七十万吨、钢材五十万吨。一九三八年，资本增加为两万万日元。我军解放鞍山后，不仅在军事上拔除了沈阳外围又一重要卫星据点，更在经济上予蒋匪的军事重工业生产以严重打击。（新华社）
