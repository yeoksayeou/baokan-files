The Cai Xingyun Guerrilla Unit Haunting the Enemy's Rear in Southern Shaanxi
Peng Lai

In southern Shaanxi, mentioning Cai Xingyun and his guerrilla unit strikes fear into the hearts of bandits and reactionaries, and excites the masses.

As early as the winter before last, they began a difficult guerrilla war along the Dan River. At that time, the situation was serious. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops mobilized large forces to repeatedly "suppress" them, completely burned down vast mountainous villages, forced farmers to "merge villages," creating "no-man's-lands," attempting to starve the guerrillas to death. At the same time, they carried out massacres of the masses and the guerrillas' families. Shi Zhizhai, the Chiang bandit's fourth district commissioner in Shangluo Town, even set up two guillotines specifically to slaughter the unyielding people of southern Shaanxi. When Comrade Gong Defang, the founder of the guerrilla unit, died of illness last spring, the Chiang bandits even dug up his body from the grave and carried it to Shang County, shamelessly claiming that they had "captured Gong Defang alive."

In these difficult days, Cai Xingyun's guerrilla unit tenaciously persisted in the struggle. They lived in the forests, sleeping in the open air, often going without food for days. But whenever they had the chance, they would suddenly appear behind the enemy. Although the masses were forced to move into the Chiang bandit strongholds, they still thought about their own armed forces, sending them intelligence at any time, risking their lives to carry grain to the mountains to find them. With the love and support of the people, they fought for eight months.

The great counter-offensive began, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River in a rapid maneuver, and part of it advanced rapidly into southern Shaanxi. Cai Xingyun's guerrilla unit met their older brothers in a frenzy of joy, which further increased their fighting spirit and courage. The number of members quickly doubled, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, they were also equipped with small cannons and new-style machine guns. The newly formed guerrilla unit continued to haunt the enemy's rear along the Dan River. Starting from the Shangluo area, they annihilated an enemy Bao-Gong office in a certain place, capturing eight enemy Bao chiefs and others, and seizing twenty-five guns. After several consecutive battles, the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan gang and local tyrants and evil gentry were all terrified. Under the prestige of the guerrilla unit, the security team of a certain town in Shang County, led by Captain Zhang Zhenshan, revolted and joined the guerrilla unit, bringing over eleven people, one light machine gun, and eight pistols. Another person surnamed Yao also brought over a dozen people.

    出没于陕南蒋后的蔡兴运游击队
    彭籁
    在陕南提起蔡兴运和他的游击队，匪顽个个害怕，群众人人兴奋。
    前年冬季他们便在丹江沿岸开始艰苦的游击战，当时情况严重，蒋胡匪调集大军反复“清剿”，并把广大山地村庄完全烧光，强迫农民“并村”，造成“无人区”，企图困死游击队。同时对群众和游击队的家属，大加屠杀。在商雒镇的蒋匪四区专员史直斋就设了两把铡刀、专门屠杀不屈的陕南人民。游击队的创始者巩德芳同志去年春季病逝，蒋匪竟把他的尸体从坟墓里挖出来抬到商县，无耻的说“活捉了巩德芳”。
    在这些严重的日子里，蔡兴运的游击队顽强的坚持着斗争。他们住在森林中，露天睡觉，常常几天没有饭吃。但是一有机会就突然出现在敌人背后。群众虽被迫迁到蒋匪据点里，仍然惦记着自己的武装，随时给他们传送情报，冒着危险背上粮食到山里找他们。在人民的爱护支援下，他们斗争了八个月。
    大反攻开始，解放军飞渡黄河，一部分神速的挺进到陕南。蔡兴运游击队在狂欢中和老大哥会师，就更增加了斗志和勇气。队员很快增加了两倍，在解放军的帮助下也装备了小炮和新式机枪。新生的游击队继续出没于丹江沿岸蒋匪后方。他们由商雒地区出发，就在某地歼灭敌人一个保公所，俘敌保长等八名，缴枪二十五支。接连又打了好几仗，蒋胡匪帮及当地恶霸土劣都吓破了胆。在游击队的声威下，商县某镇保安队在队长张振山率领下起义，投奔游击队，带过来十一个人，轻机枪一挺，手枪八支。另一个姓姚的也带过来十几个人。
