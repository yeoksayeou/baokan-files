[By] Our Correspondent

    [This news dispatch] Recently, some working comrades went to Zhao Village, Wu'an, to visit poor peasants and hired laborers to understand the land reform and general work situation in this village. These comrades had been working in government offices for a long time, and during the visiting process, after a period of exploration and experience, they have gained some experience, which is excerpted and disclosed for reference:
    Initially, these comrades lived in the courtyard of an old activist and got to know some poor peasants and hired laborers. However, these poor peasants and hired laborers did not dare to approach these staff members, fearing that the village cadres would find out and it would be detrimental to them. Subsequently, these staff members dispersed and lived in the homes of poor peasants and hired laborers, eating and sleeping with them, becoming one with them in life and emotion. From unfamiliarity to familiarity, the relationship gradually became closer.
    At the beginning, four poor peasants and hired laborers were visited, and their land was very bad and far away. The staff, focusing on their urgent demands, first put forward the slogan of "extracting fertilizer to supplement lean land." They were very happy, but still dared not act; they were afraid of the cadres and activists. The fertile land in the village belonged to the cadres and activists, and they still held the power of the village administration. Therefore, they discussed Article 5 of the Land Law Outline: The poor peasant leagues, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences are the legal executors, and the power to equally distribute land is in the hands of the poor peasants; the cadres will be re-elected by everyone in the future to thoroughly implement democracy. They also read the "Letter to Peasants" and "Letter to Party Members" from the newspaper. Everyone felt that they had evidence and began to talk about many problems of the cadres, and the situation of being attacked for raising opinions during the "face washing and wiping black" [criticism] movement last summer, and quickly connected with fifty or so people.
    Originally, the target of the connection was people who had worked hard all their lives and suffered, and still had not turned themselves around, but deviations still occurred in the connection. At the beginning, a few middle peasants and hooligans were more active in approaching the staff members. Poor peasants often praised these people for speaking, and these people often vented their grievances, inciting others to oppose the cadres. They said that the cadres had embezzled "an unknown amount," that "the cadres are all landlords," and that "peaceful solutions are impossible." Because they had some private feuds with the cadres, they wanted to take the opportunity to retaliate. A veteran said, "I have been promoted, and I am willing to let the poor peasant league distribute my land, but I want to avenge the cadres and vent my anger." This person had previously united some families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, making endless demands for care, to distribute more good land and good fruits, and confront and compete with the cadres for benefits, which had a very bad impression among the masses. He spoke more than the masses, with strong sectarian emotions and destructive emotions. The leadership adopted a policy of neither confronting them head-on nor relying on them from the beginning. Not confronting them head-on was to prevent other masses from also becoming afraid and leaving the staff members. But they could not rely on them, so they abandoned them and went directly to the poor peasants and hired laborers.
    Because they were afraid of being fooled, a sense of frustration of "not daring to believe anyone" arose among the staff members. A comrade working in the Third Street found a Jin Yintai. His grandfather was very poor, his father was an old farmhand, and his brother was nearly fifty and had never started a family; he himself had been a farmhand since he was seventeen, and only returned in 1945. There were four people in his family, and they had only had fourteen mu of land in the last two years. His house was dilapidated, obviously a poor peasant. But seeing that he spoke clearly and that he had some grain in his granary, they suspected that he might be a middle peasant or a speculator. When they found Jin Xitai, the situation seemed to be that of a poor peasant, but when they heard that the village cadres had approached him, they were suspicious and dared not approach him; someone said, "If Fang Jingui enters the poor peasant league, it will be terrible!" and they suspected that the cadres had instructed him to sabotage. In short, they did not dare to believe anyone who was active, who could speak, or who had a bowl of rice to eat. They regarded the general masses' fear of the cadres as sectarianism.
    When this batch didn't work, they found some who were both poor and couldn't speak. Some were orphans and widows, and some had epilepsy and were chronically ill, and they felt that they were useless. Later, they found some honest poor people who could work, but they felt that they knew too little about village affairs, could not speak well, were afraid of trouble, and felt that they could not play a backbone role and could not be relied upon.
    The facts that followed proved that among the honest poor peasants and hired laborers who had worked for many years, some could be active and speak well, and of course they should be relied upon. However, most poor peasants and hired laborers, due to years of exploitation and oppression, had not handled many affairs and were not good at speaking and being active. These people should still be resolutely relied upon. For example, there was a Jin Fuyou in the First Street. His father and he were both poor peasants who reclaimed wasteland, and they were outsiders in Zhao Village. Now there are still five people in the family covering themselves with two quilts. Some poor peasants mentioned him, and the staff wanted to visit him. But he told others in advance that he did not want them to go to his house. A comrade went anyway, but he dared not say anything and left after chatting about some trivial matters. The second time they went again, asked him about his living conditions, and talked to him about the equal distribution of land, extracting fertilizer to supplement lean land, that this time the poor peasants were in charge, not face washing and wiping black (he had raised opinions during the face washing and wiping black movement for the cadres and had been attacked.) In the future, the poor peasants would not only manage the village cadres, but also manage the county and district cadres, etc. He began to have a little hope, and tentatively shook the idea that "not speaking" was good. He said, "The cadres have a lot, because they have merit, and they have a reason to speak; if we want to equally distribute the land, we have no merit and no reason to speak." The staff explained to him: The common people's production of grain, service, and burdens are all merits, even greater than the cadres'! His wife interjected, "We carried stretchers two more times, so the merit is great." He said, "The families of revolutionary martyrs are given more, because they shed blood and sacrificed on the front line. If we want to talk about equal distribution, they will call their people back." The staff explained, "He went out to fight, eating the common people's food; the common people cultivated the land at home on their behalf, is that still not enough for him? Why should he be given more!" Seeing that the staff had a firm attitude towards the cadres and the families of revolutionary martyrs who had received more fruits, and that they must return them, his emotions were even higher. But then he raised a new question: "I don't have the materials, I'm not as good at speaking as others, I'm afraid it's still not going to work." The staff explained again, "Being able to farm is having materials, everyone has to rely on farmers to eat." He was happy and said, "Speaking of farming, I alone am worth three of those cadres." His emotions became higher and higher, and as he spoke, he went out and found two other poor peasants. From then on, he gradually became active.
    Jin Chengke in the Third Street always sat in the corner during meetings. His father worked as a farmhand and starved to death, his mother begged for food, and he himself worked as a farmhand for more than twenty years. Later, he reclaimed more than four mu of barren slopes and bought five mu of bad land in a year of disaster. Last year, he still worked short-term for others. When filling in the forms, the cadres said that his family of three had more than nine mu of land, which was enough to cultivate. During the face washing and wiping black movement, he suggested exchanging it for a mu of good land, and the cadres asked him "what thoughts" he had, and he quickly declared "no thoughts, no thoughts." Since then, he had been sitting in the corner, never said anything, and paid no attention to anything. This time, after similar visits and mobilization, he also went out and connected with four or five people, becoming a true activist.
    These experiences prove that firmly and unwaveringly relying on and mobilizing the honest poor peasants and hired laborers whom people looked down upon in the past, believing in them, awakening them, and making them form a backbone with courage and ability is the key to mobilizing the hired and poor peasant class. These people's current leadership ability is not yet skilled enough, and their courage is not yet sufficient, but they are much stronger than they were at the beginning. They actively pay attention to the sabotage activities of bad cadres, investigate the crimes of bad cadres in eliminating traces of embezzlement (accounts) and selling grain and cotton, and mutually advise their own people to correct their mistakes (such as promiscuity), and some demand the organization of new militia to prevent sabotage, actively preparing themselves in all aspects for being in charge in the future.
    Another important experience gained by the staff in Zhao Village is the combination of individual visits and public propaganda. A few days after the staff visited Zhao Village, they discovered that the village cadres had many sabotage activities. Village Chief Yang Zhankui, after returning from a meeting in the district, convened a meeting of the masses, saying that the village chief of Tian Erzhuang reported that he did not know where a person named Zhang (also a staff member) came from, who arbitrarily lived in Tian Erzhuang without going through the cadres, organized a group of hooligans to implement the Land Law, scaring the middle peasants and disrupting the winter school, and some middle peasants were scared into selling their flocks of sheep (actually, the village chief of Tian Erzhuang himself sold the sheep). Yang Zhankui's intention in saying this was to subtly imply that the staff in Zhao Village were also disrupting the work, and wanted to use this method to threaten the masses. Some bad cadres took the lead in selling grain, promoting "equal distribution," mobilizing middle peasants, creating panic among middle peasants, and also said that it was the staff who scared them. The director of the peasant association summoned the leaders of the peasant association groups and said, "We confiscated the property of the landlords and distributed the fruits, everyone says there are no accounts!" Some inquired about news everywhere, went to the homes of the poor peasants visited by the staff to ask questions in return, increasing the concerns of the poor peasants.
    Seeing this situation, the staff decided to tell the village cadres their intentions in a positive way, and publicly publicize the Land Law in the winter school, to suppress evil spirits and support the poor peasants and hired laborers, so that individual visits would not be disrupted. Honest poor peasants and hired laborers cannot be found through large-scale meetings, because they dare not speak publicly. Without going through the stage of secret visits, reliable backbones cannot be found.
    At the same time, when conducting in-depth visits to poor peasants and hired laborers, attention was also paid to universally uniting middle peasants. Some streets proposed a combination of universal investigation and individual in-depth visits, holding an investigation meeting of a village or ten or eight families, with middle and poor peasants all attending, conducting small-scale propaganda of the middle peasant policy, and understanding their living conditions, from which they obtained clues as to who was the poorest (some middle peasants also told us a lot about the situation of poor peasants), and then conducted in-depth visits to repeatedly understand the situation. In this way, on the one hand, the panic of the middle peasants was overcome, and on the other hand, the difficulty of some villages not being able to find poor peasants and hired laborers was broken.

    耐心寻找最受压迫的老实人
    赵庄深入访问贫雇
    个别访问与公开宣传结合，启发阶级自觉，使他们说出知心话。
    【本报消息】最近有些工作同志到武安赵庄访问贫雇，了解这个村庄土地改革及一般工作情形。这些同志长期作机关工作，在访问过程中，经过一段摸索和体验，已获有一些经验，特摘要披露，以供参考：
    起初，这些同志住在一个旧积极分子的院里，认识了一些贫雇。但是这些贫雇不敢去找这些工作人员，害怕村干部知道了对自己不利。随后这些工作人员就分散住到贫雇家里，和他们同吃同睡，在生活与感情上打成一片，从不熟识到熟识，关系就慢慢的密切了。
    一开始访问了四个贫雇，他们的土地都是很坏很远。工作人员针对着他们的迫切要求，首先提出：“抽肥补瘦”的口号。他们非常高兴，但是还不敢动；怕干部、怕积极分子。村里肥的都是干部和积极分子的，他们还掌着村政大权。于是谈土地法大纲第五条：贫农团、农会与农代会是合法执行人，平分土地的大权在贫农手里，干部将来要由大家重新选举，彻底实行民主。又念报纸上的告农民书、告党员书，大家觉得有了凭据，开始说出许多干部的问题，与去年夏天洗脸擦黑时群众提意见受打击的情形，并很快串连了五十来个人。
    原来说的串连对象是一辈子劳动受苦，至今没翻好身的人，但在串连中仍然出了偏向。开始比较主动和工作人员接近的，有少数中农、二流子，贫农常常推崇这些人说话，这些人常常发泄不平，激发别人反干部。说干部贪污了“不知多少”，“干部都是老财”，“和平解决不了。”…………因为他们和干部有些私仇，想乘机会报复。有一个退伍军人说：“我翻高了，我情愿叫贫农团分了我的地，可是我要报干部的仇，出一出气”。这人过去曾团结一些抗属与荣退军人，无止境的要求照顾，多分好地好果实，和干部对抗、争利，在群众中印象极坏，他说的话比群众多的多，带着浓厚的宗派情绪与破坏情绪。对于这些人，领导上一开始就采取了不硬碰也不依靠的政策。不硬碰是怕使其他群众也害怕起来，离开工作人员。但又不能依靠，于是抛开他们，直接深入到贫雇中去。
    因为怕上当，在工作人员中曾经产生了“谁也不敢相信”的苦闷。一个同志在第三街工作，找到一个靳银太，他祖父就很穷，父亲是老长工，哥哥年近五十，没成过家；他自己也是从十七岁住长工，到一九四五年才回来。家里四口人，最近两年才有了十四亩地，家里破破烂烂，显然是个贫农。可是看见他说话还清利，囤里还有些粮食，就怀疑他可能是个中农或投机分子。找到靳喜太，看情况也是贫农，可是听说村干部活动过他，就怀疑不敢接近；有人说了一句“方金贵进了贫农团，可不得了，恶哩！”就怀疑是干部授意来破坏。总之，对积极的、会说话的、有了一碗饭吃的，都不敢相信。把一般群众对干部的恐惧也看成了宗派。
    这批不行，又找着一些又穷又不会说话的。有的是孤儿寡妇，有的是羊羔疯、长年害病的，又觉得他们不顶事。随后找着几个能劳动的穷老实人，又嫌人家对村事知道太少，不会说话，怕是非，觉得起不了骨干作用，靠不上。
    以后的事实证明：长年劳动的老实贫雇农，其中有些能活动、会说话，当然应该依靠。但大部分贫雇由于多年来被剥削被压迫，处理事情不多，不善于说话和活动，这些人仍然是应该坚决依靠的。例如一街有个靳富有。他父亲和他都是开荒地的贫农，在赵庄是外来户。现在还是一家五口盖着两条被子。有的贫农提到他，工作员想去访问。可是他事前就告诉别人，说他不愿叫去他家。一个同志硬着头去了，但他什么也不敢说，扯了些闲话走了。第二次又去，问了他一些生活情形，给他谈谈平分地土，抽肥补瘦，这次是贫农当家，不是洗脸擦黑（他在给干部洗脸擦黑时提过意见，受过打击。）将来贫农不但要管村干部，还要管县、区干部等，他开始有了点希望，初步动摇了“不说话”好的想法。他说：“人家干部们多得，是人家有功，人家有道理说；咱要平分土地，咱没功，没道理说。”工作员就给他解释：老百姓生产粮食、支差、出负担都是功劳，比干部还大哩！他老婆接口说：“咱抬担架多抬了两回，功劳就是大。”他说：“抗属分的多，人家在前线上流血牺牲哩。咱要说平分，人家就要把人家的人叫回来。”工作员解释：“他出去打仗，吃的老百姓；家里地老百姓代耕，这还对不起他？为啥要多分哩！”他看到工作员对多得果实的干部和多得果实的抗属，都有坚决的态度，一定得退，情绪就更高了些。但又提出新问题：“咱这人没材料，不如人家会说，恐怕总是不行。”工作员又解释：“能种地就是有材料，谁也得靠种地人吃饭。”他高兴了，说：“说种地，我一个人顶那些干部三个人。”他的情绪越来越高，说着说着就出去找来了另外两个贫农，他从此逐渐积极起来。
    三街有个靳成科，以前开会总是坐在角落里。父亲住长工，饿死了，母亲曾讨饭，他本人住了二十多年长工。后来开了四亩多荒坡，灾荒年又买了五亩坏地，去年还给人家打短工。填补时，干部说他三口人有九亩多地，够种了。他在洗脸擦黑时提出想换亩好地，干部问他“啥思想”，他赶快声明“没思想、没思想。”以后一直坐在角落里，直到现在没说过话，对什么也不闻不问。这次经过类似的访问发动，也出去串连了四、五个人，成为真正的积极分子。
    这些经验证明：坚决的、不动摇的依靠与发动过去人们看不起的老实贫雇农，相信他们，唤醒他们，使他们形成有勇气、有能力的骨干，就是发动雇贫层的关键。这些人现在的领导能力还不够熟练，勇敢程度还不很够，但比开始时已经强多了。他们积极注意坏干部的破坏活动，调查坏干部消灭贪污痕迹（帐目）和出卖粮食棉花等罪行，互相劝告自己人改正错误（如性生活乱等），有的要求组织新民兵，防止破坏行为，积极从各方面为自己将来当家做准备。
    工作员在赵庄获得的另一个重要经验，是个别访问与公开宣传相结合。工作员在赵庄访问了几天以后，发现村干部有许多破坏活动。村长杨占魁从区开会回来，召集群众开会，说田二庄村长反映：不知道那儿来了个姓张的（也是个工作员），不经过干部，随便住到田二庄，组织了一伙流氓要实行土地法，把中农吓坏了，冬学也搅得开不成，有些中农吓得卖了羊群（实际是田二庄村长自己卖了羊）。杨占魁说这事的意思是暗指赵庄的工作员也是破坏工作，想用这种方法威胁群众。有的坏干部领头卖粮食，宣传要“大均产”，动中农，造成中农恐慌，又说是工作员吓坏的。农会主任召集农会小组长说：“咱们没收老财东西，分配果实，大家都说没有帐啊！”有的到处打听消息，到工作员访问的贫农家去反问，使贫农增加顾虑。
    工作员看到这种情况，确定把自己的来意正面告诉村干部，并在冬学中公开的宣传土地法，把邪气打下去，给贫雇撑腰，使个别访问不致受到破坏。老实贫雇以开大会的方式是找不到的，因为他们不敢公开讲话，不经过暗访阶段，绝不能找到可靠的骨干。
    同时，在深入访问贫雇时，也注意到普遍团结中农。有的街提出普遍调查与个别深入访问结合，开一个闾或十来八家的调查会，中贫农都来，小型的宣传中农政策，了解他们的生活情况，从中获得谁家最穷的线索（中农有的也告诉我们不少贫农情况），然后深入访问，反复了解情况。这样一方面克服了中农的恐慌，另方面也打破了某些闾找不到贫雇的困难。
