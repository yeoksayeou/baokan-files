    Border Region Government Organizes Cigarette Company
    Implements Monopoly Distribution of Cigarettes
    [Our News] In order to increase government revenue, control people's consumption, improve the quality of cigarettes, and resist the import of foreign cigarettes, the Border Region Government has decided that the Department of Trade will organize a cigarette company to uniformly establish factories for manufacturing and implement monopoly distribution. The key points of implementation are as follows: (1) All machine-made or hand-rolled cigarette factories and workshops opened within the Border Region, whether privately, publicly, or cooperatively operated, must cease manufacturing by January 30th. (2) All finished products, whether packaged or unpackaged, must be registered with the local Industry and Commerce Bureau from February 15th to 25th and can be sold on the market. If registration is not applied for after the deadline, it will be treated as illegal cigarette manufacturing, and the cigarettes will be confiscated. (3) After production ceases, the machinery (wooden hand-operated machines shall be disposed of by the factory itself) and raw materials may be purchased by the cigarette company at market prices; those unwilling to sell may retain them. (4) The cigarette tax stamps remaining in the factories and workshops will be repurchased by the Industry and Commerce Bureau at the same price. (5) Factory and workshop owners and workers who are unable to transition or make a living due to the closure of factories and workshops will be assisted by the government in changing careers or provided with loans to support them.

    边府组织纸烟公司
    施行纸烟专制分销
    【本报消息】边区政府为了增加政府财政收入，节制人民消耗，提高纸烟质量，抵制外烟进口，特决定由贸易厅组织纸烟公司统一设厂制造，实行专制分销。其施行要点如次：（一）凡边区境内开设之机制或手工卷烟工厂、作坊，不论私营公营或合作经营，统限于一月三十日前一律停止制造。（二）凡已包装或未包装之成品，统限于二月十五日起至二十五日止，向当地工商局申请登记，可以在市场出售。如过期不申请登记，经查出依私造烟论处，纸烟予以没收。（三）生产停止后，机器（木制手机由厂方自行处理）及原料，可由纸烟公司按市价收买，不愿卖者听之。（四）工厂、作坊余存之纸烟税花由工商局等价收回。（五）因工厂、作坊停工而无力转变或谋生之工厂、作坊主人及工人，由政府帮助其转业或酌予贷款扶植。
