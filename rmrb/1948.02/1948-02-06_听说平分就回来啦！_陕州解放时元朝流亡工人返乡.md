    Heard Land Will Be Divided, So I Came Back!
    Yuan Dynasty Laborers Returning Home to Shan County After Liberation
    [Jinan News] Huang Jinghe from Huang Village, Yuan Dynasty, suffered under the dark government. He had a lawsuit with a landlord, and at that time, whoever had money had the right, "one can't twist one's arm against one's thigh." His few acres of bad land were all used up. He couldn't maintain a living at home, so in 1934 he fled to work hard on the railroad in Shan County, where he had been for thirteen years. After the People's Liberation Army liberated Shan County, he returned home a few days ago. He said to the villagers: "The people in the KMT-controlled areas are really suffering. They are constantly conscripting soldiers. For example, buying a soldier costs 500,000 yuan, and giving 400,000 to his company commander will send him home. Those KMT soldiers say: 'We only go to sell ourselves for money and don't care about work, we can only be soldiers and don't care about fighting.' Over there, eating one pound of steamed bread costs 16,000 yuan, and many starving refugees die. Since the Eighth Route Army liberated Shan County, the county magistrate held a meeting in the city, and he said: 'Now those of us who have suffered from poverty can stand up!' He used the foreign flour, rice, and clothes left behind by the KMT army to help the refugees. The county magistrate also said: There are many people from other provinces and counties in the city. Now the liberated areas are all dividing land! They can divide land and houses. If they want to go home, the government will give them travel expenses. I received half a month's travel expenses and came home. I just said that I couldn't go home in this lifetime. I didn't expect the Communist Party to send me back. In the future, after the land and houses are divided, life will be much better!"

    听说平分就回来啦！
    陕州解放时元朝流亡工人返乡
    【冀南消息】元朝黄庄黄景和，黑暗政府时候，他给地主打官司，那时是谁有钱谁有理，“胳膊扭不过大腿”，把几亩坏地都化光了。他在家不能维持生活，民国二十三年逃到陕州铁路上受苦，已经待了十三年。解放军解放陕州后，前几天他回来了，他对村里群众们说：“蒋管区的老百姓真苦，经常抓兵，比如买一个兵用五十万款，到了前方给他连长四十万，就叫回家。那些蒋军的兵这样说：‘光去卖钱不管干，光能当兵不管战。’那边吃一斤馍头就得一万六千元，饿死的难民很多。自从八路军解放了陕州，县长在城里开会，他说：‘现在叫咱们受穷的翻身啦！’把蒋军丢下的洋面、大米、衣裳都救济了难民县长又说：城里外省外县的人很多，现在解放区都闹平分土地哩！能分地分房，若愿意回家，政府给路费。我领了半月的路费，来到家，我只说这一辈子不能回家，没想到共产党把我送回来，以后分了地分了房，可这就好过啦！”
