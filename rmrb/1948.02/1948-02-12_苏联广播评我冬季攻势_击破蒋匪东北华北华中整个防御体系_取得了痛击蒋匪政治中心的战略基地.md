Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Moscow Radio broadcast an article from the Soviet "New Times Weekly" on the 14th, commenting on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Winter Offensive, titled "Battles Near Nanjing." It stated: "The People's Liberation Army is successfully carrying out its Winter Offensive in the Kuomintang areas. In Manchuria, it will force Chiang Kai-shek's generals to withdraw from Jilin and Changchun. The battle to capture Xinlitun dealt a heavy blow to Shenyang, the main base of the Kuomintang in Northeast China. On the Hebei battlefield, the People's Liberation Army is operating directly near Beiping, Baoding, and Tianjin." The article went on to point out that the activities and battles of the PLA in the vast area between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River "are of particular significance. As a result of the large-scale offensive launched here, new liberated areas have been established in the vast area north to the Longhai Railway, west to the Pinghan Railway, and east to the Jinpu Railway (west of the Pinghan Railway, there are also the Yu-Shaan-E and Tongbai, Jianghan Military Regions—editor). Relying on this vast base area, the People's Liberation Army and the militia, in their joint operations in December and January, have inflicted many major blows on the Kuomintang forces operating in the area and have broken through their entire defense system. Zhengzhou, where the headquarters of the Kuomintang army is located, is besieged." After describing the PLA's capture of the important military bases of Xuchang, Luohe, and Zhumadian, and the annihilation of more than 30,000 Kuomintang troops, it added: "On January 18, after breaking through the Kuomintang army's front line in the Dabie Mountains, the People's Liberation Army advanced to the vicinity of Wuhan, a huge industrial center. At the same time, the PLA troops operating in Jiangsu inflicted powerful blows on the Kuomintang troops dispatched from Gaoyou and other strongholds, and then advanced to the vicinity of Nanjing, surrounding the city of Liuhe, 35 kilometers northeast of Nanjing. Moreover, fighting is taking place near Taixing and Taixian on the north bank of the Yangtze River, 100 kilometers from Shanghai." The article concluded: "Thus, it seems that in the course of the Winter Offensive, the People's Liberation Army has broken through the entire defense system of the Kuomintang army in Manchuria, North China, and Central China, and has gained strategic positions for striking at the main political centers of the Kuomintang-controlled areas."
