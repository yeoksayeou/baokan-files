Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Telegram: Moscow -- The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee regarding Soviet music work has been met with enthusiastic discussion and unanimous support from the entire Soviet people, who believe that this decision has great political significance. Both *Truth* and TASS have received a flood of letters supporting the decision. Yekov, a famous pianist and professor at the Moscow Conservatory, said: "Many musicians believe that their responsibility lies mainly in catering to the tastes of a small circle of music 'connoisseurs.' Most of what they play is formalistic works, which are incomprehensible and superfluous to the vast majority of the audience. They are not ashamed of this fact at all." Colonel Mikhailgis said: "The so-called 'innovators' of Soviet music, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Shebalin, and others, have led Soviet music to a dead end. In the works of these 'innovators,' the unbridled frenzy of noise angers the audience, yet music critics praise these works to the heavens." Irina, the president of the Gnessin Music Teacher's College, said: "The people are deeply satisfied and proud of the Party's decision. Because this decision once again demonstrates the particularly important role of Soviet art, as well as the constant concern of the Party leaders for art. In the Soviet Union, music must be a tool for expressing the ideas of our time, it must deeply attract and truly move the broad masses of listeners. To achieve this goal, the content of the music must be understandable, emotional, and meaningful, and it must be loved by the people. The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee represents the expression of the ardent demands of the entire Soviet people for art, and it is closely related to the source of the people's creative art and the excellent traditions of classical music. The music we need is music that is firmly rooted in the people. The music art we need is a music art that bravely moves forward, not something that uses clever-headed, bizarre things to masquerade as novelty. I am particularly delighted with the Party Central Committee's instruction on developing the classical heritage. We should be educating young people in this direction and cultivating a healthy, young generation of Soviet musicians." Titov, an engineer at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, said: "The Russian people have a very rich folk song and ballad tradition, but many of our composers have forgotten to draw inspiration from the inexhaustible source of folk art." Bakbudaov, an academician of the Leningrad Academy of Sciences, said: "In the Soviet Union, music must serve the interests of the people and express their thoughts and feelings, but Soviet composers have recently forgotten this basic truth. Soviet composers should respond to the Party's call."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Telegram: Moscow -- Soviet composers Prokofiev and Khachaturian, who were recently severely criticized by the Communist Party Central Committee, told TASS reporters that they were determined to follow the Party's instructions, thoroughly correct their past mistakes, and extricate themselves from the abyss of formalism. Khachaturian said: "The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee is the expression of the people's will. It expresses the thoughts and feelings that have moved the Soviet people for many years. And it truly and clearly shows the attitude of the Soviet people towards Western musical culture. The Soviet people not only do not reject it, but on the contrary, are willing to become true inheritors of the excellent works of classical music from various eras and countries, but the Soviet people sharply criticize and reject the decadent musical art of modern Western European and American countries, which reflect the decadence of bourgeois culture. The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee will guide Soviet composers and myself on the road of socialist realism in musical art." Prokofiev said: "The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee will become a turning point in the development of Soviet music art, and will help Soviet composers develop realistic tendencies in music creation, especially to help my own creation, overcome formalistic tendencies, so that my future works will be worthy of our people and our great country."

　　联共中央的音乐决定全苏联人民热烈拥护
    受批评的作曲家
  　遵照党的指示决心改正错误
    【新华社陕北电】莫斯科讯：联共中央公布的关于苏联音乐工作的决定，获得全苏人民的热烈讨论和一致拥护，认为这一决定具有伟大的政治意义。真理报与塔斯社连日收到拥护这一决定的投书，多如雪片。著名钢琴家、莫斯科音乐院教授耶可夫说：“许多音乐家认为他们的责任主要在迎合音乐‘欣赏家’的小圈子的口味，他们所演奏的大多是形式主义的作品，对广大听众是不可理解和多余的。他们对这一事实竟毫不感觉惭愧。”米海尔吉斯上校说：“所谓苏联音乐的‘革新派’萧斯塔可维奇，普罗柯菲也夫，谢巴林等人，把苏联音乐引上绝路，这些‘革新派’的作品中，噪音的狂放不羁，使听众愤怒，音乐批评家们竟把这些作品捧上天去。”格涅辛音乐师范学院院长伊利娜说：“人民对党的决定深感满意，并引以自豪。因为这一决定又一次表明苏联艺术特别重要的作用，以及党领袖对艺术的不断关心。在苏联，音乐必须是表达我们时代思想的工具，它必须深深吸引和真正感动广大的听众。为达到这一目的，音乐的内容必须是能理解的、有感情的、有意义的，是老百姓所喜闻乐见的。联共中央这一决定代表了全苏联人民对艺术的热切要求之表现，并且是与人民创造性艺术的源泉以及古典音乐的优秀传统密切联系着的。我们需要的音乐是牢固地在人民中生根的音乐。我们需要的音乐艺术是勇敢向前进的音乐艺术，而不是以聪明过了头的离奇古怪的东西来冒充新奇。党中央对发展古典遗产这一指示，我特别感到欢欣。我们正应该朝着这个方向去教育青年，培养健康的、年青一代的苏联音乐家”。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂工程师狄托夫说：“俄罗斯人民有非常丰富的民间歌曲与歌谣，但我们有许多作曲家却忘记了从民间艺术的无穷尽的源泉中汲取灵感。”列宁格勒科学院大学士巴克布大奥夫说：“在苏联，音乐必须为人民的利益而服务，表达他们的思想和感情，但苏联作曲家近来却忘记了这一基本真理，苏联作曲家应当响应党的号召”。
    【新华社陕北电】莫斯科讯：最近受到联共中央严厉批评的苏联作曲家普罗柯菲也夫及哈加杜里阳，日前分向塔斯社记者表示决心遵照党的指示，痛改前非，自拔于形式主义的深渊。哈加杜里阳说：“联共中央的决定是人民意志的表现。它表现了多年来激动着苏联人民的思想与感情。并真实而明确地表明了苏联人民对西方音乐文化的态度。苏联人民不但不摈弃，相反地愿意成为各个时代各个国家古典音乐中优秀作品的真正继承者，但苏联人民尖锐地批评并摈弃近代西欧和美洲各国堕落的音乐艺术，这些音乐反映资产阶级没落文化的颓废性。联共中央的决定将引导苏联作曲家和我本人走向音乐艺术的社会主义现实主义的道路。”普罗柯菲也夫说：“联共中央的决定将成为苏维埃音乐艺术发展的转折点，将帮助苏联作曲家发展音乐创作上现实主义倾向，尤其是帮助我本人的创作，克服形式主义倾向，使我将来的作品无愧于我国人民和我伟大的国家。”
