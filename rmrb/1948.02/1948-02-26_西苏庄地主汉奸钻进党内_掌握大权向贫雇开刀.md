　　[News from our paper] The investigation team organized jointly by the Border Region Government and this newspaper, during the investigation of the Wei case, carefully learned about the situation in Xisuzhuang. The main characteristic of this village is that landlords and traitors squeezed into the Party, controlled everything, and used the Party's land reform policy to attack poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants.

　　Xisuzhuang has a total of 89 households, 339 people, and 2,133 mu of land. The ten landlord and rich peasant households occupy almost half of the village's land, and all of it is good land. The 24 poor and hired peasant households, with 50 people, have an average of only 1.8 mu of bad land per person. After the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese invaders occupied Shahe, and the Kuomintang army retreated south, looting along the way. Bandits rose up, and the masses suffered considerable losses. In the spring of 1938, after our army arrived, an anti-Japanese government was established. Landlord Wei Jinqi evaded burdens and fled, and other landlords also mostly stopped hiring laborers, divided up their families and dispersed their land to conceal their property. In the winter, the enemy occupied Gongsiyao and Yangfan Town (both more than ten li away from the village). In 1940, the enemy built two lines of blockades west of the Pinghan Railway. A blockhouse was built east of the village, and it became an enemy-occupied area. In the two years of severe famine in 1942 and 1943, less than 100 people remained in the village (mostly landlords and rich peasants). The number of livestock, which was about 150 at the beginning of the war, had been reduced to less than 40, and there were no mules at all. The enemy imposed many donations, and the grain collectors could not cope. The landlords and rich peasants hired middle and poor peasants to act as puppet Bao chiefs, taking turns. In 1944, our armed work team advanced behind enemy lines, and began to establish a secret anti-Japanese government and militia in the village. Some of the cadres who persisted in the struggle against the enemy at that time, including Wei Ziyi, the son of Wei Dianhua, were all poor peasants. The village militia was once surrounded by the enemy, and three were killed. They all performed very well in the struggle. Later, as the situation improved, the landlord Wei Jintang squeezed in. He had become sworn brothers with Hu Daosheng, the commander of the puppet army, and relied on Hu's power to become a puppet township chief. He also opened a salt shop with Hu's younger brother. At first, he pretended to be actively resisting Japan, and later became the manager of the cooperative. In the summer of 1945, worker Liu Xiucheng introduced him into the Party without investigation. He quickly became the director of the Armed Committee and seized all the power in the village. He privately replaced the village chief with his henchman Wei Jingsheng (a middle peasant), and introduced a gang of bad elements: militia captain Wei Jinnyu and self-defense captain Wei Jinmei were his cousins, and their background was bankrupt rich peasants. Cooperative manager Wei Fengming and village secretary Wei Jinming were all his close relatives, and all were rich peasants. Overall, out of the eleven village cadres, nine had been traitors, puppet soldiers, or puppet Bao chiefs. Everything was according to Wei Jintang's word. In the spring of 1946, Wei Jintang was promoted to the district as an assistant for culture and education. After Wei left the village for the district, in order to continue to wield power, he promoted Wei Jingwu to succeed him as the director of the Armed Committee. Wei Jingwu's family used to be rich peasants, but they had gone bankrupt. He himself had never worked since he was a child. At the beginning of the war against Japan, he became a bandit, was captured by us, and later escaped home to join the enemy, becoming a puppet soldier under Gao Delin. Later, he was captured by us again. He was injured in the Pinghan Campaign and returned home before being demobilized. Wei Jingwu successively served as branch secretary, sharing power with the village chief.

　　Because power was in the hands of the landlords, the "mass movement" in Xisuzhuang was mainly not to struggle against feudal forces, but to struggle against poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants. This big rock slab has never been overturned and broken, and the masses have been suppressed and unable to rise up. Since the Japanese surrender, the village has undergone three major movements, but some struggles were fake struggles. After Wei Fenglin's family was struggled against, he sent his son to join the army. The cadres, under the pretext of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, returned all the things that had been struggled out and even gave him three more houses. The cadres called this "struggling against exploitation, supplementing the families of soldiers." The three families of Wei Caiqun, Wei Jingxun, and Wei Fengtong were all landlords and rich peasants from the Ming Dynasty. But because they had some connections with the cadres in power, they were all sheltered. Not only were they not struggled against, but they also divided up a lot of the fruits of the struggle. The village cadres looked for various excuses to struggle against middle and poor peasants, creating disputes between middle and poor peasants, and even mobilizing landlords and rich peasants to struggle against middle and poor peasants. A total of sixteen poor and middle peasant households in the village were struggled against. Wei Jingyang had been a farmhand in Wei Fengyuan's house before the war against Japan, and only rose to the level of a middle peasant at the beginning of the war. However, the village cadres took advantage of his mistake of buying salt for ten people and struggled him for eight sacks of grain and fifteen sacks of wheat, taking away all the grain for the year. And the Wei Fengyuan and Wei Fengkui brothers who hired him were instead able to divide up his grain. The poor peasant Wei Jianxin did not have a mu of land. He bought a mu of land in the year of famine. Another poor peasant, Wei Jingliang, also bought four mu of land. The village chief incited the land sellers (middle peasants) to force them into struggle. Village chief Wei Jinsheng and village Armed Committee director Wei Jingwu committed many evils when they jointly held power in the village. The village chief suspected that his mistress had a relationship with the poor peasant Wei Tanbao, so he conspired with the director of the Armed Committee to beat Wei Tanbao to death. Five peasants were beaten, thirty-one were detained, and six were falsely accused of being "special agents." Whoever was late for a meeting was beaten, and whoever did not attend was fined two catties of oil. Seventeen people were fined. In order to better consolidate their rule, they bought off some of the masses to inform them, cheer them on, and commit violence. They also encouraged them, saying: "Just go ahead and do it. If you do something wrong in the future and get your head cut off, we have the director and the village chief!" Poor peasant Wei Laodi said: "Whenever I hear the drums beating for a meeting, my legs shake with fear. I used to be a farmhand for the landlords and rich men, and I dared to sing a few wild tunes. Now I don't even dare to say a word. Don't even talk about dividing things, I don't even know if I can keep my life!"

　　From the perspective of the amount of land distributed, the poor peasants and hired laborers did increase some land compared to the past. Before the movement, thirteen poor peasant and hired laborer households had 154.7 mu of land. After the movement, it increased to 343.9 mu, averaging 7.9 mu of land per person, and averaging 3.74 shi of grain per person (this figure was assessed by the cadres in 1945), while the thirteen cadres and activists had 435.1 mu of land, averaging 9.7 mu per person, and averaging 6.2 shi of grain per person, averaging 6.3 dou per mu. The grain production of the cadres was twice that of the poor peasants and hired laborers. The two families of the poor peasants Wei Dianhua and Wei Xianfu, who were swept out of the house, had less than two mu of land per person, and averaged less than five dou of grain per person. The rich peasant Wei Caiqun, who was sheltered by the village cadres in power and not struggled against, had an average of ten mu of land per person and an average of 5.8 shi of grain per person. A total of 27 livestock were struggled out in the village, and the village cadres divided up 15, while the poor peasants and hired laborers only got three. The director of the Armed Committee divided up two, and sold one. The poor peasant Wei Jianxin took his chance and grabbed a piece of paper with a donkey on it. He couldn't use it himself, and was often dragged by the Farmers' Association to grind flour. Later, the village cadres used the excuse of taking care of newcomers from Shanxi and forced him to "support" it. He fed it for seven months and lost the fodder for nothing.

　　A total of 20 good courtyards and houses were struggled out, and the cadres occupied ten of them. The masses generally shared one courtyard between two households, while the cadres each occupied one courtyard alone. Good farm tools, clothes, and furniture were also taken by the village cadres. At least 200 shi of grain were not distributed, and it was announced that anyone who had not eaten could go and collect it. But poor peasants and hired laborers could not get it if they wanted to eat it, while the cadres could take it at will. Now there is not a single grain left. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, Armed Committee director Wei Jingwu still ate and drank extravagantly. He ground 1.2 shi of wheat for the New Year, slaughtered a pig, and even split the three extra rooms he occupied into firewood and burned it. The village chief's expenses were not accounted for, and the cooperative's accounts were never announced to the masses. Last winter, the whole village raised 200,000 yuan to establish a credit cooperative, which was all taken by Wei Jingwu to buy mules for himself. Now there are 16 poor peasant and hired laborer families who lack houses, livestock, and farm tools (plows, seeders, rakes). Old man Wei Youde, 69 years old, had been a farmhand all his life. He was told that he was too old to be allocated a house, but he was ordered, along with Gou Shidi, Wei Dianchen, and three other poor peasants and hired laborers in their sixties, to cultivate and carry water for the families of soldiers.

　　西苏庄地主汉奸钻进党内
  　掌握大权向贫雇开刀
    【本报消息】边府与本报共同组织的调查组，在进行魏案的调查中，仔细的了解了西苏庄的情况，该村主要的特点是地主、汉奸钻进党内，把持一切，利用了党的土地改革政策，向贫雇中农开刀。
    西苏庄共八十九户，三百三十九口人，二千一百零三十三亩地，十户地主富农，几乎占了全村土地的一半，而且全是好地。贫雇二十四户五十口人，每人平均只有一亩八分坏地。“七七”事变后，日寇侵陷沙河，国民党军队向南溃退，沿途大肆抢掠，土匪蜂起，群众损失不小。三八年春我军到达后，曾建立抗日政权。地主魏锦奇躲避负担逃亡，其他地主亦多停止雇工，分家分散土地，隐蔽财产。是冬敌进占公司窑、羊范镇（均距该村十余里），四○年敌在平汉路西筑二道封锁线，该村村东按了炮楼，遂沦为敌占区。四二、四三两年大灾荒，全村逃得剩下不到一百人（留下的多系地主富农），抗战初约有一百五十头牲口，至此已减到不足四十头，骡子一头也没有了。敌人捐款甚多，粮差无法应付，地主富农乃雇中贫农出面当伪保长，轮流替换。四四年经我武工队挺进敌后，又开始在该村建立秘密抗日政权与民兵。逃荒的中贫农也陆续回村。当时坚持对敌斗争的几个干部，其中有魏殿花之子魏子义，都是贫农。该村民兵曾被敌人包围，杀死三个，斗争中都表现得很好。后来局面好转，地主魏锦堂便钻进来了。他曾经与伪军团长胡道生拜把子，并依附胡势力当了伪大乡长，还与胡的弟弟伙开过盐店。他起初假装积极抗日，后来当了合作社经理。四五年夏天，工作员刘秀成不加考查，便介绍他钻进党内。很快就当了武委会主任掌握了全村大权。私自把村长换成他的狗腿魏景升（中农），引进了一伙坏蛋：民兵队长魏锦雨、自卫队长魏锦美都是他叔伯弟兄，成份是破落富农。合作社经理魏凤鸣、村书记魏锦明都是他近门兄弟，都是富农。总起来看十一个村干中，有九个人都当过汉奸、伪军、伪保长，一切是听魏锦堂的话。四六年春，魏锦堂又被提拔到区上任文教助理员。魏离村到区后，为继续掌权，便提拔魏景武继任武委会主任。魏景武过去家庭是富农，破落了，他自己从小没劳动过。抗战初当土匪，被我俘虏，后逃跑回家投敌，当高德林伪军，后又被我俘虏。平汉战役负伤未经退伍即回家，魏景武并先后任支书，与村长分掌大权。
    由于大权是掌在地主手里的，因此西苏庄的“群众运动”，主要不是斗争封建势力，而是斗争贫雇、中农。这块大石板一直没有掀翻打碎，群众一直被压着不能起来。日本投降以来，该村经过三次大运动，但有些斗争是假斗。魏凤林家被斗后，把儿子送去参军。干部借口优待抗属，把斗出来的东西全部退回，还多分给他三间房子。干部叫这是“斗争剥削，补充抗属”。魏财群、魏景训、魏凤同三家都是明朝下来的地主富农。但因与当权干部有些瓜葛，便都包庇了下来，不仅没有斗，反而分了不少斗争果实。村干寻找各种借口，斗争中农贫雇，制造中贫农之间的纠纷，甚至发动地主富农来斗争中贫农。全村贫雇中农被斗争的共有十六户之多。魏景洋抗战前还在魏凤元家当长工，抗战初才上升为中农。村干却拿他多买了十个人盐的错，斗了他八布袋谷，十五布袋麦子。把全年的粮食都斗光了。而雇他工的魏凤元、魏凤魁兄弟反而来分他的粮食。贫雇魏见心没有一亩地，灾荒年买了一亩地。另一贫雇魏景良也买了四亩地，村长便挑拨卖地户（中农）硬将他们斗了。村长魏锦升与村武委会主任魏景武在村分掌大权时，作恶很多。村长怀疑自己的姘头与贫雇魏谈宝有关系，便与武委会主任合谋将魏谈宝打死。农民中有五个人被打过，有三十一个人被扣过，有六个人被诬指为“特务”。开会时谁到迟了就打，谁不到罚二斤油，曾有十七人被罚。他们为了更好的巩固自己的统治，曾收买了一些群众，替他们通风报信，呐喊行凶。他们并鼓励说：“尽管往前干，将来做错了杀头，有咱主任和村长！”贫雇魏老弟说：“一听到打鼓开会，腿肚子就吓得打哆嗦，我以前给地主老财住觅汉（当长工），还敢放野腔唱一唱，现在连声也不敢吭了，不要说分东西的话，连命还不知道保不保哩！”
    从土地分配数量上看，贫雇是比过去增加了些土地，运动前十三户贫雇有土地一百五十四亩七分，运动后增加到三百四十三亩九分，每人平均地七亩九分，每人平均产粮三石七斗四升，每亩平均产粮四斗六升（这数字是四五年干部评议的），而十三户干部、积极分子却有土地四百三十五亩一分，每人平均地九亩七分，每人平均产粮六石二斗，每亩平均产粮六斗三升。干部产粮比贫雇多一倍。被扫地出门的贫雇魏殿花、魏贤福，两家每口人平均地还不到二亩，每口人平均产粮五斗。被掌权村干包庇没斗的富农魏财群，却每人平均地十亩，每口人平均产粮五石八斗。全村共斗出二十七头牲口，村干分了十五头，贫雇只得了三头。武委会主任分了两头，卖了一头，贫雇魏见心碰运气抓纸蛋抓到一头驴，自己用不上，时常被农会牵去推磨，后来村干又借口照顾山西新来户，强逼他“拥护”出来，他喂了七个月，白赔了草料。
    好院好房，共斗出二十座，干部就占了十座。群众一般都是两户分一座院，干部都是每户独占一座。农具、衣服、家具好的也都被村干占了去。粮食至少有二百石没有分，宣布是谁没有吃了可以去领。但是贫雇要吃就领不到，干部却可随便拿，现在一颗也没有了。土地法大纲公布后武委会主任魏景武仍然大吃二喝，过年磨了一石二斗麦子，杀了一口猪，还把多占的三间房劈成柴火烧了。村长开支没有帐目，合作社的帐也从没有向群众宣布过，去冬全村集股二十万元成立信用社，都被魏景武拿去给自己买了骡子。现在贫雇中缺房子、缺牲口、缺农具（犁耧耢耙）的十六家。六十九岁老汉魏有德，做了一辈子长工。说他老了，不能分房子，但却又命令他和狗屎爹、魏殿臣等三个六十多岁的贫雇老汉给抗属代耕、担水。
