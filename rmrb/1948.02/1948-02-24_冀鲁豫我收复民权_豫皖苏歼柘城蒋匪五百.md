On the same day, the local troops of the Seventh Military District captured the Tuanshan stronghold south of Dong'a city, and the entire enemy small artillery platoon was annihilated, capturing 21 people and seizing two 60mm mortars. Additionally: On the evening of the 15th, a part of the local corps of the Third Military District captured the Yanji and Lao Zhai strongholds east of Yutai, and most of the defending enemy was annihilated.

One light machine gun, 31 rifles, one 60mm mortar, and some ammunition were seized.

　　[News from Taihang] The Taihang Military Commission announced on the 15th of this month that our border militia annihilated more than 700 enemies in January. In the past month, our border militia, militia work teams, and rotation teams have taken the initiative to attack, penetrate deep behind enemy lines, and exert excellent tactics such as joint defense operations and flying mine explosions, inflicting significant casualties on the dying Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops. According to extremely incomplete statistics: In 29 independent operations and 8 coordinated operations with troops, our militia annihilated a total of 767 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops, including 210 killed or wounded, 111 killed or wounded by landmines, 439 enemy squad leaders and below captured alive (including more than 300 members of the Hui team), and 7 defectors. Sixteen members of the masses were liberated. They also coordinated with the troops to recover 9 strongholds such as Wuling in Tangyin. 45 rifles, 5 short guns, more than 250 spear guns, 150 bombs, and more than 360 rounds of ammunition were seized, and 120 sheep and 8 cattle and donkeys were intercepted from the masses. One militiaman was killed and one wounded.
　　[News from Taihang] The Yucheng local armed forces of the Second Military District and a part of the main force of the military district penetrated deep behind enemy lines and annihilated 40 Yan bandits in two battles. On the night of the 8th, our Yucheng local armed forces suddenly penetrated behind enemy lines and attacked the enemy stronghold of Dongguo, five miles southeast of the city. This stronghold was stationed by a battalion of the Second Regiment of the Eighth Column of Yan Xishan's army and more than 50 local puppet armed forces. The battle began on the morning of the 9th, and we immediately rushed into the village and fought the enemy for an hour. After destroying an enemy heavy machine gun squad, we took the initiative to withdraw from the battle. In this battle, 26 enemies were killed or wounded, one heavy machine gun, one rifle, more than 2,800 rounds of ammunition, two boxes of heavy machine gun parts, and five livestock were seized. In addition, a part of the main force of our Second Military District also penetrated deep behind enemy lines on the night of the 8th and ambushed at Beizhang Village, ten miles southwest of Taigu City. At noon on the 9th, five plainclothes members of the Dongxianyang Yan bandit police second squadron, puppet village chiefs, and puppet self-defense regiment leaders entered our ambush circle and were all captured alive. One rifle and one pistol, and more than ten rounds of ammunition were seized. The enemy who came out of Dongweiyang to reinforce were also repelled by us.
　　[News from this newspaper] On the evening of the 9th of this month (the evening of the 30th of the twelfth lunar month), our Xinxiang First District Work Team, taking advantage of the enemy's lack of preparation during the New Year, crossed the Pinghan Road and surrounded the puppet organization in Hetun Village. More than 30 members of the enemy's regular team were drinking and celebrating. Our work team jumped into the courtyard and shouted, "Lay down your arms and we won't kill you!" After a series of slogans, not a single shot was fired in the house. Ru Yaolin, the commander of the Xinxiang County Security Regiment, and Wang Xianglin, the captain of the village's regular team, and 11 others were captured alive. Six rifles, three pistols, and more than 30 rounds of ammunition were seized. We suffered no casualties.
