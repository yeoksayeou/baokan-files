Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 26th: A unit of the Eastern Line Liberation Army, in coordination with the local armed forces of the Fifth Military Subdistrict, achieved a great victory in suppressing bandits in the Jiaxian-Linru area north of the Ru River, annihilating a total of 3,533 local Chiang Kai-shek bandits in half a month. This campaign was launched on the morning of the 9th and ended on the afternoon of the 22nd. In fourteen days of fighting, the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the area were thoroughly eliminated. A total of 24 strongholds were captured, including the central strongholds of the Eastern and Western Line local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Qianhouzhongwang (40 li northwest of Jiaxian), Zhifang (30 li southeast of Linru), as well as Ciba, Shantouzhao, Shasandian, Huluzhai, Dongxizhaoluo, Taipuzhai, and Wuhuan Store. Over 3,450 bandits were captured alive, including bandit guerrilla battalion commanders Wang Ji, Han Lubin, and Han Laozhong, as well as local bandit leaders Wang Zhongyi, Wang Laotai, Dong Jintang, Li Guixing, Han Tianqi, and Li Gouhui. Eighty-three bandits were killed or wounded. The captured materials included eight machine guns of various types, one small cannon, more than 260 rifles, 72 locally made guns, more than 30 pistols, more than 2,800 rounds of ammunition, 655 broadswords and spears, 124 shovels, and 21 livestock.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 26th: A frontline reporter reported on the great victory in suppressing bandits in the Jiaxian-Linru area north of the Ru River, stating that after we liberated the area along the Ru River, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Zhengzhou and Luoyang sent bandit leader Wang Dongcheng to collude with local habitual bandits Wang Zhongyi and reactionary landlords, big bullies, and secret agents, and coerced a small number of people to carry out rebellion, conducting settling of scores everywhere, and brutally killing peasants and our cadres, which the local people deeply hated. Our army launched a suppression campaign on the 9th of this month, and more than 2,000 emancipated peasants from Jiaxian and Baofeng enthusiastically participated in the war. In the fourteen days, under the combination of our strong military pressure and political offensive, most of the people who were deceived and coerced into participating in the rebellion laid down their weapons. When we captured the bandit stronghold of Taipuzhai, the bandits surrendered completely after hearing our soldiers' shouts. As a result, more than 3,500 bandits in the Jiaxian-Linru area, except for more than 80 who were killed or wounded, surrendered their arms. The democratic government and the Liberation Army, in accordance with a lenient policy, quickly released most of them, and held victory celebration meetings in various villages. Deputy Commissioner Li of the Fifth Administrative Office and Deputy Commander Niu of the military subdistrict attended and spoke, exposing the conspiracies and crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and explaining the democratic government's policy of eliminating harm for the people. On the spot, more than 700 young and strong men from several villages requested training and armed self-defense. The masses on both sides of the Ru River are continuing to investigate bad elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 26th: The local armed forces of the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Military Subdistricts, combined with a unit of the Liberation Army, achieved victory in clearing out local Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yiyang and Yunxian, annihilating a total of 1,785 bandits in four days. (1) The local armed forces of the Third Military Subdistrict, in coordination with a certain unit of the Eastern Line Liberation Army, launched a large-scale campaign to clear out the bandit nests in the Minggao Mountain and Dagaoshan area northwest of Yiyang on the 18th. By the 20th, they had successively captured bandit strongholds such as Yuwang Mountain, Dazhuang Gou, and Jiudian, killing or wounding more than 210 local Chiang Kai-shek bandits below the company commander level, and capturing bandit battalion commanders Wang Guodong, Ding Hailiang, and others, totaling 1,235. They seized four light machine guns and 274 rifles. Another unit of our army killed more than 60 bandits in the Heiyu area, 90 li southwest of Songxian, on the 18th. (2) A unit of the local armed forces of the Fourth Military Subdistrict intercepted more than 1,000 fleeing bandits from Zhechuan at Baizhigou, 110 li north of Yunxian city, on the 18th, seizing one light machine gun and eight rifles. On the 21st, they annihilated a company of the Chiang Kai-shek secret service battalion in Junxian at Caojiadian, 70 li north of Junxian, capturing more than 70 enemies and seizing one machine gun and 72 long and short guns. In addition, more than 100 enemies entrenched in Jingziguan surrendered to us and have now entered the liberated area.
