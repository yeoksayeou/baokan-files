Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The Chiang bandits' 8th Army, 43rd Brigade, 127th and 129th Regiments, a total of over 1,000 men, entrenched in Longkou, Jiaodong, launched an attack on the outskirts of the city on the 17th of last month, targeting villages such as Yili'ao and Shangcun. They were fiercely repelled by our besieging forces and retreated in disarray back into the city at dusk. We killed, wounded, and captured over 700 enemy soldiers and seized a portion of their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The headquarters of the Chiang bandits' 8th Army, 42nd Brigade, entrenched in Yantai, transported a large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and grain by sea to Longkou City as reinforcements. On the way, they encountered a strong wind and heavy fog, and the motorboat lost its direction and ran aground on the northern beach of Changyi. The Chiang bandits on board attempted to escape to Weixian city. On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, they landed at Chenjiawazi, ten miles southwest of Changyi city, and pretended to be New Fourth Army personnel seeking guides. However, they were recognized by the village cadres, who reported to the district government. District cadres immediately led over ten militiamen to surround the enemy in the school and launched a political offensive. Finally, without firing a single shot, the entire enemy force surrendered. A total of 108 men were captured, including the original Chiang Security 26th Regiment Commander Liu Antai, Ordnance Officer Wang Dong, and others. One American-style light machine gun, four submachine guns, and sixty-four rifles were seized. At the same time, the grounded motorboat was also seized, and the local democratic government is currently inventorying the military supplies and materials.
