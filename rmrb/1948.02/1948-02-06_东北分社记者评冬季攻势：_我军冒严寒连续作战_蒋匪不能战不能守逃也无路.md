Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: A reporter from this branch commented on the Northeast People's Liberation Army's one-and-a-half-month achievements, stating: This winter operation, in which our army braved temperatures of minus thirty degrees Celsius, occurred precisely when bandit chieftain Chen Cheng, having suffered a disastrous defeat in our autumn offensive,妄想 [wangxiang - presumptuously attempted/fancifully hoped] to catch his breath, and precisely when bandit Luo Zhuoying was boasting about his "solid points," "connecting lines," and "expanding areas" strategy. However, our army neither entered a "winter hibernation" as Chen Cheng had imagined, nor did it allow Luo Zhuoying and his ilk's extravagant boasting to materialize in the slightest. Instead, regardless of the bitter cold, we bravely fought the enemy, launched continuous large-scale operations, and directly pressed on the outskirts of the bandit lair of Shenyang, proactively seizing the repeatedly defeated enemy and dealing them heavy blows. In the glorious achievements of the past month and a half, our army not only won three battles and annihilated one army headquarters, four full divisions, and other units, totaling 58,000 troops (the achievements of our local forces and the Jicha Rehe-Liaoning military region have not yet been calculated), but also recovered ten county towns. Several achievements are particularly worth pointing out: First, as a result of our army's three victories, seizing more than ten important towns around Shenyang, the enemy's supply and transportation lines – the Beining and Changchun Railways – became even more fragmented, and the enemy's precarious nests of Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and other major cities became even more isolated. Our army's strategic links between the eastern and western theaters became even more connected, our forces could be concentrated and maneuvered to a greater extent, and even more favorable conditions were created for completely annihilating the Northeast Chiang bandits. Second, the annihilation of an enemy army headquarters and two full divisions in the battle of Gongzhutun in the three victories, and the defeat of ten enemy divisions in the blocking battle, further exposed the enemy's profound contradiction of being unable to fight, unable to defend, and having nowhere to escape. The enemy's attempt to use all possible concentrated forces to make a last-ditch struggle was finally shattered by us. Therefore, the enemy today feels very insecure, even with each of their remaining ten-odd strongholds defended by one to three divisions. If they concentrate their forces again, they will lose the satellite strongholds of the precarious nest of Shenyang and face the possibility of being besieged by our concentrated and powerful corps; if they disperse their defenses, they fear being eaten piecemeal by us, one by one. This is the profound contradiction that bandit chieftains Chen and Wei cannot escape. The anti-people criminal group cannot escape the people's final punishment, and the American reactionaries cannot give them the magic to revive them; this trend is becoming more obvious and certain. Third, our army annihilated the entire 49th Army, which had been reinforced to the Northeast after the autumn offensive, in the one-and-a-half-month winter offensive. This will make the Chiang bandit troops sent to the Northeast battlefield to die in the future even more timid and fearful, losing their fighting courage. Therefore, although the so-called Fan Hanjie Corps has begun to reinforce the Northeast, our powerful Northeast People's Liberation Army has enough strength and confidence to eat one when they come, and eat a pair when two come. This new reinforcement corps will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the 49th Army, as dictated by the situation. Under such circumstances, it is entirely foreseeable that our army will continue to work hard, proactively seize the enemy, quickly and bravely encircle and annihilate them, and continue to win even greater victories.

    东北分社记者评冬季攻势：
    我军冒严寒连续作战
    蒋匪不能战不能守逃也无路
    【新华社东北四日电】分社记者评东北解放军一个半月的战绩称：此次我军冒零下三十余度严寒的冬季作战，是正当匪首陈诚在我军秋季攻势下，新遭惨败，妄想获得喘息之时，也是正当罗匪卓英正在胡吹什么“固点”、“连线”、“扩面”战略之时。然而我军既未如陈诚所幻想的进入“冬眠状态”，也未使罗卓英辈的特等牛皮，得到丝毫兑现。却仍是不顾天寒地冻，奋勇杀敌，连续大规模作战，直逼匪巢沈阳的四周，主动的抓住屡战屡败的敌人，予以沉重的打击。一个半月来的光辉战绩，我军不仅三战三捷，歼敌一个军部四个整师及其他部队共五万八千余众（我地方兵团及冀察热辽战绩尚未计算在内），收复县城十座。尤其值得指出的几点成就是：第一、由于我军的三战三捷，夺取了沈阳的四周的十余重要城镇，就使得敌人的补给运输线——北宁、中长等铁路，更为支离破碎，敌军危巢沈阳、长春、吉林等大城市，也更陷于独悬孤立。而我军则东西两大战场的战略联系，更为贯通，兵力更能高度集中、机动作战，更加创造了全部歼灭东北蒋匪的有利条件。第二、由于此次三战三捷中公主屯一役我军一举歼敌一个军部，两个整师，并在阻击战中打垮敌军十个师，这样就更加暴露了敌军既不能战、又不能守、逃也无路的深刻矛盾。敌军使用一切可能集中的兵力，进行垂死挣扎的尝试，也终于被我粉碎，因此敌人今日对仅存的十来个据点，每一据点用一至三个师防守，还是感到很不保险。要再集中兵力罢，则危巢沈阳的卫星据点尽失、更有遭到我集中的强大兵团围攻的可能；要分散守备罢，则又害怕被我以大吃小，一一被歼，这就是陈、卫匪首无法解脱的深刻矛盾。反人民的罪恶集团，无法逃脱人民的最后惩罚，美国反动派也无法给他们以起死回生之术，这一趋势是更加明显而确定了。第三、我军在冬季攻势一个半月中，歼灭了秋季攻势以后增援东北的四十九军全部，这就会使得今后被派来东北战场送死的蒋匪部队更加胆寒心战、丧失其战斗勇气。因此尽管所谓范汉杰兵团已开始增援东北，但我强大的东北解放军却有着足够的力量和信心，能够来一个吃一个，来两个吃一双，这个新的增援兵团，其将步入四十九军的后尘，为形势所必然。处在这样的情况下，今后我军再接再厉，主动抓住敌人、迅速勇敢的加以包围歼灭，继续打更大的胜仗，也是完全可以预期的。
