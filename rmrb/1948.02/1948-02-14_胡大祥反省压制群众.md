    Hu Daxiang Reflects on Suppressing the Masses
    (Comrade Hu is from Wuhe Township, Third District, Wu'an County, he is 26 years old, from a poor peasant background, and worked as a hired laborer. He joined the Party in October 1939, came to the district to work in March 1946, and is now working in the Third District Party Work Team.)

    When I was a hired hand, I had a relationship with the landlord's daughter. After liberation, when I was a cadre, I wanted to marry this daughter, but my relatives opposed it, but the daughter was willing. After we got married, the relatives gave us good food. I said, "Let's eat it!" I didn't know this was the landlord's bribery. Chen Youyi said I was getting slick, that now I had a wife, I wouldn't work hard. I said I was willing to serve the masses, but I didn't agree with his view in my heart. Later, when I was political director, I was going to be transferred out of the area after only a few days. I thought: "Look at this higher-up, knowing it's wrong not to go out, but going out means immediately leaving my wife." The higher-up said I wouldn't leave the district, so I became a district cadre in Wuhe Township. I wanted to build a kiln, and after telling the cadres, I used stonemasons to get stones and had the masses carry the stones, using two hundred workdays for the two kilns. I thought I had merit, but in reality, I exploited the masses.

    When I was chairman of the Peasant Association, I took the cadre route, distributing seventy catties of wheat to each person for the New Year. I said I didn't want it. But I didn't refuse, and it was sent home.

    I suggested getting a mule. It died a few days later. Then I suggested getting an ox, and then we swapped it for another mule. After that, the cadres all wanted to feed mules.

    The branch secretary changed three wives, and the militia director changed one. This was us covering up for each other.

    Once, when carrying a stretcher, more than ten households were unwilling to go. The masses said, "The cadres have mules but don't go, and we don't have food, how can we go?" I said, "You're dead backward, there's a problem," and detained them. I thought: "If we implement democracy, how can we not get contributions?"

    It was even worse when I suppressed the masses during conscription. The masses said, "Conscription is us, carrying stretchers is also us." I detained them. When I got to the district, I even said that my village was volunteering. When I got back, I wanted to eat noodles and had the masses cultivate the land for me. The masses said, "Don't look for a good wife, you won't be able to keep a good wife." The past work can't be exposed.

    During the return of the fruits of struggle, the masses criticized Hu Daxiang for building the kiln incorrectly and for feeding the mules incorrectly. They also said that the cadres were having affairs. I said, "This is simply nonsense," and made the masses admit their mistakes.

    Today, I realize that the Party is closer than my own mother. If I have done something wrong, I must reflect and correct myself. I will speak about my own dark side, and admit my mistakes. I think I will definitely be able to change.

    胡大祥反省压制群众
    （胡同志武安三区五和乡人，现年二十六岁，成份贫农，出身雇工。一九三九年十月入党，四六年三月到区工作，现在三区党务工作队工作。）
    我当长工的时候，即和地主闺女搞上关系。解放后当了干部，想和这个闺女结婚，亲戚反对，闺女愿意。结婚后，亲戚送给好吃的。我说吃吧！我不知道这是地主的收买。陈友义说我老油腻，有了老婆地，不好好干了。我嘴里说愿意为群众服务，心里不同意他的说法。以后当政治主任，没几天就要调出工作。我想：你看这个上级，不出去明知不对，出去马上离开老婆。上级说不离区，才在五和乡当了区干部。我要盖窑，给干部说了一下，用石匠起石头，用群众背石头，两道窑用了二百个工。我认为自己有功劳，实际是剥削了群众。
    当农会主任走干部路线，过年每人发七十斤麦子。我说不要。可是我没动，就送到家里。
    我提意搞了个骡子。过几天死了。又提意搞了个牛，又换了个骡子。以后干部都想喂骡子。
    支部书记换了三个老婆，武委会主任换了一个。这是我们互相包庇。
    一次抬担架，十余户不愿去。群众说干部有骡不去，俺没有吃的能去？我说你死落后，有问题，就扣起来。我想：实行民主，还能不出贡献？
    扩兵时打击群众才厉害。群众说扩兵是俺，抬担架亦是俺。我就把他扣起来。到区上还说我村是自动。我回去就想吃面，让群众给代耕地。群众说不要寻好老婆，寻下好老婆保不住。过去的工作不能见天。
    退果实时群众提胡大祥修窑不对，喂骡不对。还说干部搞破鞋不对。我说这简直胡说，让群众承认了错误。
    今天我认识到党比娘亲，做错了事，我要好好反省改过，自己有黑就说，有错误就承认，我想一定能改了。
