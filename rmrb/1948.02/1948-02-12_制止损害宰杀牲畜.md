    Stop Damaging Slaughter of Livestock

    To the Editor:
    Recently, there has been a lot of beef and donkey meat being sold in Pinding Chengguan. Therefore, we conducted a special inspection. We found that Zhao Cunyi's slaughterhouse in Nanguan Street alone (there are three in Pinding Chengguan District) has slaughtered a total of 149 cattle and donkeys in the past six months, including 28 cows capable of producing and 114 donkeys. Since the promulgation of the Land Law, they have slaughtered another 35, including 12 cows capable of producing and 6 donkeys. They buy good cattle and donkeys, fearing they will be checked during tax assessment, so they nail nails more than an inch long into the animals' hooves, making them lame. Such deliberate slaughter of productive livestock should be punished. In order to prevent landlords, rich peasants, and saboteurs from taking advantage of loopholes and killing draft animals, we suggest that all localities pay attention to inspection. (Ting Dong, Ji Yuan, Xiu Feng, Zheng Guo, Pan Lin, Huai Yuan, Ju He, Jin An, Zi Fu)
    The joint exposure of the phenomenon of indiscriminate slaughter of livestock in Pinding by Comrade Ting Dong and others is extremely important. Please, those responsible in Pinding, quickly investigate and stop this criminal act of destroying the Land Law and harming the interests of the people, and publish the results of the investigation. We ask correspondents and readers from all over the country to check whether there are similar phenomena, and if any are found, please write to us in detail.                —Editor

    制止损害宰杀牲畜
    编辑同志：
    平定城关最近卖牛驴肉的很多。因此特别作了一个检查。发现仅南关街赵存义的一个杀房（平定城关区共三个），从开始到现在，六个月共杀了牛驴一百四十九头，内有能生产的牛二十八头，驴一百一十四头。在公布土地法以后，还杀了三十五头，内有能生产的牛十二头，驴六头。他们买下好牛驴怕上税时检查出来，便在牲口蹄上钉一寸多长的钉子，牲口就拐了。象这样故意宰杀生产牲畜应受处分。为防止地主、富农及破坏分子投机钻空，杀害耕畜，我们建议各地应该注意检查。（庭栋、计元、秀峰、正国、盘林、怀远、巨和、锦安、自福）
    庭栋等七位同志联名揭发平定乱杀牲畜现象，极其重要，请平定负责方面迅速检查，制止这种破坏土地法危害人民利益的罪恶行为，并将调查结果公布。我们要求各地通讯员及读者都来检查一下是否有同样现象，如有发现，请即详细的写来。                ——编者
