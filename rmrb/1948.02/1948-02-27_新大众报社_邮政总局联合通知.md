Joint Notice from Xin Dazhong Newspaper and the Postal Administration to all Post Office Station Masters:

The Xin Dazhong newspaper's announcement in Issue 7 regarding the price increase for the March newspaper was published too late and without prior consultation with the Postal Administration. Local post offices have already begun subscribing to the March newspaper, making it difficult to collect additional fees. To facilitate distribution and avoid procedural chaos, we have re-negotiated and decided that the price of Xin Dazhong newspaper will increase starting from April, to 350 yuan per copy per month. From March 1st, all subscriptions for April or later newspapers will be charged at the new price of 350 yuan. However, subscriptions for the March newspaper will be charged at the original price of 200 yuan, regardless of when they are made, and will not be increased (any overpayment based on the new price should be refunded to the subscriber). Specific regulations are as follows:

	I. All subscriptions for April or later newspapers made in January and February will be honored and no additional fees will be collected based on the new price.
	II. However, from March 1st, if any subscriptions for April or later newspapers are still made at the old price (200 yuan), the difference should be collected at the new price (350 yuan). You must patiently explain the reasons to subscribers, work diligently, and be responsible for collecting the additional fees, with a deadline of March 20th for reporting to the newspaper.
	III. For subscriptions to the March newspaper or subscriptions to April and later newspapers that were already made at the new price before March 1st due to receiving the Xin Dazhong Issue 7 price increase announcement, all overpayments should be fully refunded to the subscribers, with an explanation of the reason.
	IV. All post office stations are prohibited from falsely reporting subscription periods, overcharging, or failing to refund money that should be refunded. Violators will be subject to punishment.
	V. Accounting procedures for collecting and refunding newspaper fees:
		A. When refunding overpaid newspaper fees, the subscriber should provide a receipt stating "Received from the post office ×× yuan for overpaid Xin Dazhong newspaper subscription for ×× month," stamped with the subscriber's seal. When collecting additional fees, a receipt should be given to the subscriber. All procedures must be completed by March 20th.
		B. Prepare three lists each for collected and refunded newspaper fees, indicating the month, number of copies, amount collected, and amount refunded. Send one copy to the General Administration, one to the Regional Administration, and one to the newspaper for reconciliation. Send the subscriber's receipts to the General Administration for verification.
		C. For those who pay newspaper fees using four-part vouchers, the General Administration will verify and correct them. For those who remit newspaper fees by bank draft, each post office should contact the newspaper directly to settle overpayments and underpayments.

Upon receiving this notice, all post office stations should act accordingly. You must also inspect and assist all postal agencies, commission agencies, sales outlets, and distribution networks to ensure thorough implementation and avoid errors!

专栏：

　　新大众报社  邮政总局联合通知各邮局站长：
    新大众第七期关于三月份报纸增价启事，因登载时间太晚，且未与邮总交换意见时，各地邮局已将三月份报纸订起，如再行补收报费，困难必多。为便利发行克服手续紊乱起见，兹经重新商定：新大众报纸改自四月份起增价，每份每月三日五十元。自三月一日起，凡预订四月或四月以后报纸者，一律按新价三百五十元收费。但不论何时，凡补订三月份报纸者，都按原价二百元收费，不予增加（已按新价之多收部分，应即退还订户）。并具体规定几点如下：
    一、凡一、二月份已经预订的四月或四月以后的报纸，一律照发，不再按新价补收。
    二、但自三月一日起，如仍有按旧价（二百元）预订的四月或四月以后报纸时，则应一律按新价（三百五十元）补收齐全。必须向订户耐心解释，说明原因，认真努力，负责补收，并限三月二十日结束，汇报报社。
    三、凡三月一日前，如因接到新大众第七期增价启事，即已按新价补订的三月份报纸，或按新价预订的四月及四月以后报纸者，应将多收之报价全部退还订户，并说明原因。
    四、各局站不得假报订期，额外多收或该退不退等情事，否则，须受处分。
    五、补收与退还报费的会计手续：
    甲、多收之报费退还时，由订户开具“收到邮局×月份多收之新大众订报费××元正”订户盖章之收条。如补收报费时，应给订户开具补收报费收据。均限三月二十日前办理完毕。
    乙、将补收与退还之报费，分别列表各三份，注明月份、份数、补收与退还钱数，分寄总局、区局及报社，以便对帐。并将订户收条寄总局备核。
    丙、用四联单拨付报费者，由总局核对更正。用汇票汇交报费者，由各局自行与报社接洽，多退少补。
    各局站接到本通知后，即应照办执行。并须检查帮助各邮务所、代办所、代售处、发行网等，务求贯彻而免差错为要！
    　　　　　　　　　　此通知　　　　　　　　　二月二十日
