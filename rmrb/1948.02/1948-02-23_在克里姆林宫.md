　　In the Kremlin
    By Guofu Bake, translated by Shao Furen

    During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, Sidor Artemyevich Guofu Bake commanded a large-scale Ukrainian guerrilla group, penetrating deep behind enemy lines, sweeping the German rear guard, destroying railways and bridges, overturning military trains, and burning enemy warehouses and oil plants to coordinate with the main force. He was awarded the rank of Major General for his outstanding achievements and twice awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for his military exploits, and was respected by the people everywhere, known to women and children. His book "From Putil to the Carpathians" was a sensation in the Soviet Union. --Translator.

    During those most tense days, one day--it was in the second half of August--I received a radio telegram summoning me to Moscow to attend a conference of guerrilla commanders.

    It is obvious what kind of mood I was in when I said goodbye to my comrades around the carriage. I was eager to take the carriage to the airfield of the Orel guerrilla team, and then fly to Moscow by plane.

    I don't know why, but everyone was convinced that I would be received by Stalin in Moscow, so the people naturally entrusted me to convey their warm guerrilla greetings to the leader; not simply to convey a common greeting on behalf of everyone--they said, of course, Sidor Artemyevich, don't forget--but to convey greetings specifically on behalf of us, that is, individually representing each member. Scouts, demolitionists, mortar men, artillerymen, female medical staff, young messengers, etc., also asked me to convey their special greetings on their behalf. My coat pockets were stuffed with letters, which were to be mailed when I arrived in Moscow.

    …………………………………………

    Shortly after arriving--it was August 31st--we received a phone call warning us not to leave our rooms and run around; we would be received by Comrade Stalin in the Kremlin. Although this was not unexpected--I expected this might happen while I was still on the plane--on the way to the Kremlin, I only thought about one thing: in a moment I would walk into Stalin's office, meet him, and he would talk to me. What good luck!

    Before entering Stalin's office, we passed through several rooms. I thought, "I'm about to see him." Stalin was always in front of my eyes, just like I saw him in the photos. When the door of his office opened, I saw Comrade Stalin exactly like that. It was as if we had met many times and were very familiar with him! Stalin was standing in the middle of the room, still wearing the same clothes that people were familiar with in the photos. Beside Stalin was Voroshilov, wearing a marshal's uniform.

    "Look, this is him, Guofu Bake!" Comrade Voroshilov said.

    Stalin smiled. He shook my hand, greeted everyone, and asked us to sit down. The person next to me at the table turned out to be Molotov. I didn't see Vyacheslav Mikhailovich (Molotov's name--translator) until I sat down next to him.

    Comrade Stalin sat at the table, diagonally opposite me. I thought this reception must be very short--this is a very tense moment! However, Joseph Vissarionovich (Stalin's name--translator) calmly began the work conversation. He asked about our families and whether we were still in contact with them. Sometimes he needed to interrupt the conversation to go to the phone. When he returned to the table, Comrade Stalin repeated the question. He talked to this person for a while, and then to another. When it was my turn to talk, I felt as if Joseph Vissarionovich slowly took my hand and pulled it towards him. Perhaps everyone had this feeling. Then everyone regained their senses and calmed down. Obviously, Stalin noticed this and started talking about the guerrillas. He first asked me how our contact with the people was, and how the people felt about the guerrillas. I stood up, wanting to report, but Comrade Stalin said there was no need to report, and asked me to sit down and answer the questions he raised.

    Comrade Stalin asked me many questions. When answering the first question, I began to describe how we maintained contact with the people, how the people helped us, etc. Joseph Vissarionovich immediately made us understand that this was the most important point, and he believed that this point was of great significance. He nodded frequently, as if saying, "Yes, yes, it is good to be closely connected with the people."

    On some issues, Comrade Stalin focused our attention, while other issues were only mentioned in passing. Among them, when talking about the issue of contact with the local people, Stalin asked me whether the guerrilla team needed political commissars. But when I said that it was difficult for only one commander to complete all the political work, because this work had to be done not only in the troops, but also in all the villages and towns we passed, Comrade Stalin said, "Understood," and the conversation about the political commissar issue ended like this. Stalin never repeated this question.

    When talking about how our equipment was, how our clothing was, and how our weapons and munitions were replenished, I replied:

    "There is only one source, Comrade Stalin! It all depends on the enemy, on the spoils of war."

    "Very good," Stalin said, "Now we will supply you with our own weapons."

    While answering Joseph Vissarionovich's questions, I thought that he knew everything I was saying. The reason why he asked me was just to lead me to a certain important idea, to help me clarify something myself. Only later did I realize that he was unknowingly leading me to these conclusions from beginning to end, but when I understood, I was shocked: how simple and clear!

    After I answered a series of questions, Comrade Stalin asked: Why can our guerrilla team become a mobile guerrilla team? I described some of the advantages of mobile tactics, which we proved in the combat experience in the Sumy area.

    After listening to me, Stalin asked an unexpected question: If everything is as you said, if mobile warfare is advantageous, then can't we advance to the right bank of the Dnieper River?

    This was serious, and I couldn't answer immediately.

    "Think about it," Stalin said.

    We had never talked about the issue of attacking the West Bank region of Ukraine, and we didn't dare to dream about it. Comrade Stalin called our guerrilla team a mobile guerrilla team, which was completely correct. The essence of our tactics lies here--Stalin summarized it with the most accurate word. But our mobile warfare is from one county to another, and this time we have to pass through several states and cross the Desna River and the Dnieper River. The scale is completely different.

    "What is this!" I thought. "Isn't the scale of the battles we planned in the Shinarie Forest and Staraguda area much larger than what we could do when we first came out of the Spasent Forest? Didn't the summer advance on Putil's battle leave the winter advance from Khvosevka far behind? The scale of our operations is constantly expanding. At first, we didn't leave the county boundary, but later we advanced to all parts of the northern Sumy Oblast, and now we have left the Sumy Oblast boundary. In this way, there is nothing impossible in Comrade Stalin's proposal. He is just drawing conclusions from our experience, and he is sending us to places that we cannot do ourselves, and it is obvious that people are most needed there at this moment. In fact, why are we always circling around the Sumy area, turning around the old nest? Isn't the whole advantage of our mobile tactics that we always have the initiative and can strike the enemy's most painful points at any time?"

    These thoughts inspired me to answer the questions raised by Comrade Stalin.

    Stalin was talking to others at this time, glanced at me, probably seeing from my expression that I was already able to answer and was waiting for him to ask me. When he suddenly turned around to speak to me, I was surprised, as if he was always paying attention to me and had guessed my thoughts, and said:

    "Please tell me, I'm listening, Comrade Guofu Bake."

    "I think, Comrade Stalin," I said, "we can advance to the right bank of the Dnieper River."

    "What do you need for this?" Stalin asked.

    I replied that what we needed most urgently were artillery, automatic rifles, and anti-tank guns.

    "We have everything," Stalin said, and ordered me to immediately write a request for everything needed for the advance to the West Bank.

    I wrote the request and calculated the number of flights needed to transport all the materials I requested by air, and I was shocked--I found that the number was too large. "Can I request so much immediately?" I thought about it and rewrote the request, greatly reducing the number. Even so, I was afraid that when I handed the request to Comrade Stalin, he would say: "Ah, you are extravagant, Comrade Guofu Bake!"

    The result was not like this. Stalin looked at the list I presented and asked:

    "Can these guarantee you?"

    When I said that I didn't intend to request too many things, Stalin returned the request to me and ordered me to rewrite it.

    "We can issue everything you need," he said.

    When redoing the request, I thought that it would be best to give the soldiers some boots, but I thought it was too much, so I didn't write boots, but requested leather shoes. Stalin read the new request and immediately crossed out the leather shoes. Alas, I still wanted to get boots! But just as I was about to scold myself, Stalin's hand had already written "boots" on top of the crossed-out "leather shoes".

    When Stalin talked to us, it was as if he had a lot of time, without urging us at all, allowing us to use our thinking quietly, and all problems were solved on the spot immediately, without delaying for a minute.

    On the eve of parting, Stalin gave us the advice:

    "Comrades, the most important thing is to maintain close contact with the people," he smiled, waved his hand, and pointed to the people sitting at the table with us and said: "For the time being, you are our second battlefield."

    On the way back, when crossing the front line by Douglas plane to the Brian Forest, I was convinced that the period of fundamental change in the course of the war was not far away. The conversation with Comrade Stalin and the order to attack that I read before taking off in Moscow left no doubt about this matter... (Translated from Soviet Small Series)

### 在克里姆林宫

　　在克里姆林宫
    郭甫巴克作  邵夫任译
    西道尔·亚尔泰莫维奇·郭甫巴克在苏联伟大祖国战争中，曾指挥乌克兰的大规模游击兵团，深入敌后，横扫德寇后方留守部队，破坏铁路与桥梁，颠覆军用列车，烧毁敌军仓库与油厂等，以配合主力作战。勋劳卓著，晋级少将，并以战功两度荣获苏联英雄称号，到处受人民尊敬，妇孺皆知。其所著"从普梯夫里到卡尔巴特"一书，为苏联轰动一时之作品。　　　　　　　　　--译者。
    在那些最紧张的日子里，有一天--这是在八月后半月--我接到一封无线电报，召我到莫斯科，出席游击队指挥官的会议。
    很明显，我当时怀着什么样的心情，和围在马车周围的同志们告别，我急待坐马车潜行到奥勒尔游击队的飞机场，由那里再乘飞机飞往莫斯科。
    不知道为什么，大家都确信我将在莫斯科晋谒斯大林，于是，人民自然是托我代向领袖致以热烈的游击队敬礼；并不简单是代表大家致一个共同的敬礼，--他们说，这是当然的，西道尔·亚尔泰莫维奇，你别忘了--而是专代表我们，也就是分别地代表每一个队员致敬。侦察员、爆炸手、迫击炮手、炮兵、女医务员、少年通信员等，也都求我代表他们专专致敬。我的上衣口袋里，塞满了信件，这些信件在我到莫斯科时，就要寄出。
    …………………………………………
    到达之后不久--这是在八月三十一日--来电话警告我们说，不要离开房间乱跑；将到克里姆林宫晋谒斯大林同志。虽然此事并未出我意料--我还在飞机上时，就料到这事可能实现，--可是在往克里姆林宫去的途中，我只想着一桩事：一会儿就要走进斯大林的办公室，面见他，他还要和我谈话哩。多末好的运气！
    在没进斯大林的办公室之前，我们穿过几个房间。我想："马上就要见到了。"斯大林总是站在我的眼前，象我在像片上见到的一样。当他的办公室的门开开时，我看见斯大林同志正是那样子。简直就象我们已经见过许多次，和他很熟似的！斯大林站在房子中央，仍是穿着人们在像片上所熟悉的那套衣服。斯大林身旁是伏洛希罗夫，穿着元帅制服。
    --看，这就是他，郭甫巴克！--伏洛希罗夫同志说。
    斯大林笑了。他握了我的手，和所有的人寒暄一下，就请我们坐下。我旁边桌子跟前的人，原来是莫洛托夫。我已经坐到他身旁时，才看见了瓦切斯拉夫。米海洛维奇（莫洛托夫的名字--译者）。
    斯大林同志坐在桌子跟前，和我斜对着。我想，这个接见一定很短促--这是多末紧张的时刻啊！可是，约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇（斯大林的名字--译者）从容不迫地开始了工作谈话。他问起我们的家属，问我们是否还和他们保持联系。有时他需要中止谈话，走向电话机去。回到桌子跟前时，斯大林同志又重复问这问题。他一会儿和这个人对谈，一会儿又和另一个对谈。轮到和我谈了，我觉得，似乎约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇慢慢地牵住了我的手，向着他拉去。恐怕是，所有的人都有这种感觉。随后大家恢复了神志，镇定下来。显然是，斯大林察觉了这个，就谈起游击队的事情来了。他首先问我，我们和人民的联系如何，老百姓对游击队的关系如何。我站起来，想要报告，可是斯大林同志说不需报告，让我坐下回答他提出的问题。
    斯大林同志向我提了许多问题。在回答第一个问题时，我开始叙说我们如何和人民保持联系，人民如何帮助我们等，约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇马上让我们了解，这点最重要，他认为此点有重大意义。他频频点头，仿佛说："对，对，和人民紧密地联系，这很好。"
    在某些问题上，斯大林同志集中了我们的注意力，而另外一些问题只是顺便提提而已。就中，谈到和当地老百姓联系的问题时，斯大林问我，游击队里需不需要政治委员。可是当我说到仅仅一个指挥官，很难完成全部政治工作，因为这工作不仅在部队里要做，还要在所有我们路过的村镇里做时，斯大林同志说："清楚了"，关于政治委员问题的谈话，就这样结束了。斯大林再没重复这一问题。
    谈到我们的装备如何，被服如何，以及我们的武器军需品的补充来源如何等问题，我答道：
    --只有一个来源，斯大林同志！全靠敌人，靠战利品。
    --很好，--斯大林说，--现在我们要以本国武器接济你们。
    我一面回答约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇的问题，一面想道，凡是我所讲的，他全都清楚，他之所以问我，只是为了把我引到某一重要思想上去，以帮助我自己弄清楚某种事物罢了。只是到后来我才明白，他从头到尾是在不知不觉之中使我得出这些结论，可是当我了解之后，吃了一惊：这多么简单，明确！
    在我回答了一连串问题之后，斯大林同志问道：我们的游击队为什么能成为挺进的游击队？我叙说了机动战术的一些长处，这些长处是我们在苏姆斯克一带的战斗经验中证明了的。
    斯大林听完我的话，提出一个意想不到的问题：若是一切都象你说的那样，若是挺进有利的话，那么，我们就不能向德聂泊河右岸挺进吗？
    这事情很严重，我不能马上答复。
    --想一想看，--斯大林说。
    关于向乌克兰的河西地区出击的问题，我们从来没谈过，我们不敢梦想这件事。斯大林同志称我们的游击队为挺进的游击队，这完全正确，我们战术的全部精华就在这里--斯大林用一个最确切的字眼，把它概括了。但是我们的挺进，是从这一县到另一县，而这次却要通过几个州，强渡德斯纳河和德聂泊河。规模迥然不同。
    "这算什么呢！--我想道。--难道我们在希奈里森林和斯塔拉古达地方时计划的战役，在规模上来说，岂不是大大超过了我们由斯巴圣森林才出来时所能做的吗？难道夏季挺进普梯夫里之役，不是把由赫沃塞夫卡出发的冬季挺进丢在后面很远了吗？我们作战的规模在不断扩大。起初，我们不出县界，后来已经挺进了整个苏姆斯克州的北部各地，而现在我们已经出了苏姆斯克州的疆界了。这么一来，在斯大林同志的提议中，没有什么不可能的了。他不过是从我们的经验中做出结论，而为我们自己所不能做的，他派我们去的地方，很显然，那里此刻最需要人去。其实，我们为什么老是在苏姆斯克一带打圈子，围着老巢转呢？我们机动战术的全部优点不就是在于我们老是掌握着主动，随时可以给敌人的最痛处以打击吗？"
    这些想法启示了我解答斯大林同志提出的问题。
    斯大林这时正在和别人谈话，瞥了我一眼，大概是从我的神色上看出来，我已经能够解答，并且在等待他来问我。当他突然转回身来向我说话的时候，我很惊讶，仿佛他总是在注意我，并且猜透了我的思想似的说道：
    --请你说吧，我听听，郭甫巴克同志。
    --我想，斯大林同志，--我说，--我们可以向德聂泊河右岸出击。
    --为了这，你们需要什么呢？--斯大林问道。
    我回答说我们需要最迫切的是大炮，自动步枪和反坦克枪。
    --全都有，--斯大林说着，就命令我立刻写一张请求书，请领挺进河西所需要的一切用品。
    我写好请求书，计算一下空运我请的全部物资所需的飞行次数，不禁大吃一惊--我发觉这数字太大了。"难道可以立刻请领这么多吗？"我想了想，就重新写了请求书，把数目大大缩减。纵然如此，可是当我把请求书递给斯大林同志的时候，还害怕他说："啊，你们铺张起来啦，郭甫巴克同志！"
    事情结果并非这样。斯大林看了一下我呈上的纸单子，问道：
    --难道这些就能保证你们了吗？
    当我说道我不打算过份请领许多东西时，斯大林就把请求书还给我，命令我重写。
    --一切需要的东西，我们都能发给，--他说。
    重做请求书时，我想道，最好能给战士们领一些靴子，但是认为这太过份，就没写靴子，请些皮鞋。斯大林阅过新的请求书，马上就把皮鞋抹掉了。嗨呀，我还想领靴子呢！可是，我刚要骂我自己时，斯大林的手已经在勾去的"皮鞋"两字上面写上了"靴子"。
    斯大林同我们谈话时，仿佛他有很多时间似的，毫不摧促我们，让我们安安静静地运用思考力，而一切问题都当场立时解决，一分钟也不拖延。
    临别之际，斯大林给我们的赠言说：
    --同志们，最要紧的，就是要和人民保持紧密的联系，--他笑了笑，挥一挥手，指着我们在桌子跟前坐着的人们说：--暂时你们就是我们的第二战场。
    在归途中，乘都拉斯机越过前线飞往布利安森林时，我确信战争进程根本转变的时期已经不远。和斯大林同志的谈话，以及我在莫斯科起飞前读过的出击命令，更不容对此事抱有任何疑虑了……………（译自苏联小丛书）
