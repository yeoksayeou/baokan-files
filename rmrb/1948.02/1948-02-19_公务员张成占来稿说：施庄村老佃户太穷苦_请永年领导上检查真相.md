Civil Servant Zhang Chengzhan's Submission: Old Tenant Farmers in Shizhuang Village Are Too Impoverished
Please Yongnian Leaders Inspect the Truth

I am a civil servant in the Political Department of ××. I participated in the people's movement in Shizhuang Village, Fourth District, Yongnian County. My name is Zhang Chengzhan. I am reporting something to you, and I ask you to point out a solution. Since we came to this village, the district and village cadres have not cared whether the masses have food or not. When the district cadres come to the village, they do not connect with the masses, but only with the cadres. They ask the cadres, "Have the masses been liberated?" The cadres say yes, they drink some wine, eat some meat, and leave. They simply don't care whether the masses are liberated or not. There is a big landlord in this village named Yu Benxiu. His family has two or three hundred mu of land and more than a dozen houses. Since the Eighth Route Army came, the bad men in his family have all run away, leaving only the old mother and more than a dozen women. More than forty years ago, he employed a tenant farmer. Until last year, when his family was struggled against, he stopped employing this tenant farmer. It wasn't that he couldn't afford to employ him; he was afraid of a thorough struggle against him. This tenant farmer is over seventy years old. He exhausted his strength working for him, and his health is poor. Now he has no land and no house. He lives in a temple, begging for food every day. I asked him, "Where are you from?" He said, "I am from Zhao Zhuang Village. My parents both starved to death. I suffered for others from the age of fourteen until now. They don't need me anymore, and I have no way to survive. I'm going to die soon!" Tears fell from his eyes. Later, I told the village cadres, but it didn't help. One day, when I came back from eating, I saw the landlord, the master of this old tenant farmer, come out eating white flour meat buns. I hated him in my heart. I thought, this is a case of the poor not being able to truly turn over; the landlord still has plenty of white flour and meat to eat, and no one gives the poor anything to eat when they beg. The next morning, as soon as I went out, I saw this old tenant farmer carrying a stick and a small bag, walking and crying. I called him back, and he opened his big mouth and came to me to ask for food. I was not afraid of criticism from the cadres, and I didn't tell the cadres. I led him to his master's house to ask for food. I said, "Hey! Give him some food!" A young girl was standing in the yard. She reported inside. I looked inside and saw the old mother sitting on the kang, still using this young girl. I said to give some, and she said there was none. I said, "Isn't there? There's a basket in the cupboard." She wouldn't give any. I became stern, and she took out two buns and steamed buns, six in total. As soon as I gave them to the old man, he burst into tears.

The temple where he lives has no bedding. I looked at the landlord's house. There were eighteen blankets on the three kangs, and there were so many chests, cabinets, and other things. Everyone, tell me, what kind of liberation is this? I think this situation is common, not just in this village. I ask the government to thoroughly resolve this.

    公务员张成占来稿说：施庄村老佃户太穷苦
    请永年领导上检查真相
    我是××政治部的公务员，我在永年县第四区施庄村参加民运，我叫张成占，我向你们反映一个事情，请你们指出解决。自从我们来在这村，区干村干都不管群众有吃没吃，区干来到村里，不给群众接头，光给干部接头，他问干部；群众翻了身没？干部说翻了，他们喝上些酒，吃些肉就走了。他们根本就不管群众翻身没有。这村有个大地主虞本修，他家二、三百亩地，十多处房子，自八路军来了，他家男的坏家伙都跑了，光丢下老妈、女子十多口。他四十多年以前，用着一个佃户。一直到去年，他家被斗，不用这佃户了。他不是用不起了，他是怕彻底斗争他。这个佃户七十多岁了，给他做活把力用尽，身体不健康了，现在没地没房，他住在庙里，每天出来要些吃的东西。我问他：“你是哪里人？”他说：“我是赵庄村人，父母都饿死了。十四岁就给人家受苦，一直到现在，不用我了，我也没有法。我就快死呀！”他的泪就掉下来了。后来我给村干部说，也不顶事。我一天吃饭回来，我看到这个老佃户的主家——大地主出来拿着白面肉饱子吃，我的心很恨他，我想这是穷人翻身翻不了，地主白面肉还吃不清，穷人要饭也没有人给。第二早晨起来，我一出门见这个老佃户拿着棒子，拿着小口袋，走着哭着，我叫他回来，他就张着大嘴，就向我来要吃的东西，我也不怕干部批评，我也没给干部说，我领着他去他主家要吃，我说：“嘿！给些吃的东西！”有个小妮在院子里站着，她一向里报，我就往里一看，炕上坐着老妈，还用这满妮子，我说给些，他说没有，我说：“那不是？在柜上放着一筐子。”他就不给，我就起了态度，他拿出两个饱子、蒸馍共六个，我一给老汉，他张嘴大哭。
    他住的庙，也没铺的，也没盖的。我看了看地主家里，三个炕共有十八条毯子，箱子、柜等等东西多的很，大家说说，这是什么翻身？我想不光是这村，普遍有的是这情况。我要求政府给彻底解决。
