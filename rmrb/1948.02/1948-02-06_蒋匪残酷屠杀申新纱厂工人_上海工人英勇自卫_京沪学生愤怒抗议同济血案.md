    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: According to various sources: The blood of Tongji University students is not yet dry, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shanghai created another even larger-scale Shen Xin Textile Factory tragedy on the 2nd. More than 6,000 male and female workers (more than half of whom were female workers) of the Shen Xin Textile Factory No. 9 went on strike for four days to fight for reasonable living conditions and demand year-end bonuses. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shanghai dispatched a large number of military police and police from the entire city to suppress them. Under the command of the executioner Xuan Tie-wu, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Songhu garrison, they surrounded the factory with tanks and armored vehicles, and used fierce firepower from American-style machine guns and rifles and bayonets to carry out a cruel massacre of unarmed male and female workers. More than 60 male and female workers were killed and injured, and more than 300 were arrested (Associated Press). Among them, two female workers were trampled to death by Chiang Kai-shek bandit police, and another female worker was thrown from the third floor to her death by Chiang Kai-shek bandits. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits committed the atrocities, they aroused the heroic self-defense of unarmed workers, who fought back against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits with iron sheets and stones. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' cruel massacre of Shen Xin Textile Factory workers has aroused the anger of the people and the working class in Shanghai and all parts of China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Shanghai News: Shanghai and Nanjing students are taking action to protest the Tongji University bloodshed incident created single-handedly by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Students from major middle schools in Shanghai have formed many Tongji Bloodshed Incident Support Associations to denounce the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' bloody crimes and rescue arrested students. Nanjing students were extremely angry after learning about the Tongji Bloodshed Incident. On the 1st, more than 300 Nanjing students took a bus to Shanghai to express their condolences and support for the anti-oppression actions of Shanghai students. In a mass demonstration held by students of Shanghai Jiaotong University on January 30, they unanimously decided to send a protest letter to the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek municipal government, condemning the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for "using the most barbaric methods rarely seen in modern history," using knives, swords, clubs, rifles with bayonets and light machine guns to beat and stab the unarmed students of Tongji University, preventing them from going to Nanjing to petition; and demanding the immediate release of the detained students. St. John's University claimed that eleven students from the school were arrested on the 29th while seeing off Tongji University students to Nanjing to petition.
