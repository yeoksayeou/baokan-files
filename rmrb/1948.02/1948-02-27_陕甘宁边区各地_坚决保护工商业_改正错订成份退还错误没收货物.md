Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: Various places in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region resolutely protect industry and commerce, return wrongly confiscated industrial and commercial property, and correct the class status of merchants who were wrongly classified as landlords or rich peasants. In Mizhi Yin City, merchants who also owned land were mistakenly classified as landlords and rich peasants, and their industrial and commercial property was confiscated, causing fear among merchants in general, who hid their goods. After the Citizens' Committee studied the situation and convened a citizens' meeting to discuss and explain the issues, the mistakes were corrected one by one. For example, the Lü Chongchuan family, consisting of fifteen people, had an annual expenditure of about 24 shi of coarse grains. They owned 18 *xiang* of riverside land and 7 *xiang* of mountain land, all of which was rented out, yielding about 3 *shi* of coarse grain in rent annually. In addition, they ran a copper shop, doing everything themselves, with an annual income exceeding 21 *shi* of coarse grains, accounting for the main part of their livelihood. In the past, they were mistakenly classified as landlords, and their industrial and commercial property was confiscated. Now, their class status has been changed to handicraftsman with feudal exploitation. According to the principle that industry and commerce should be protected regardless of whether the owner is a landlord or not, all the confiscated goods from the shop have been returned. Only the majority of their land was taken out and distributed to the masses, while still leaving them two *xiang* of vegetable plots. Another example is Ai Shenhua, who mainly relied on a small sundry goods shop to make a living and owned 17 *xiang* of land, all of which was rented out. In the past, he was mistakenly classified as a rich peasant, but now his status has been changed to merchant. After the correction, Ai took the initiative to tell the work team that he had hidden goods in other areas and requested a letter of introduction to retrieve them and resume business. In Suide City's Fifth District, Guo Qingfeng's family of five owned five weaving machines (two of which were jointly operated). In addition to one family member participating in labor, there were also three hired workers and three apprentices. They also ran a shop and owned two and a half *xiang* of riverside land and two piles of paddy fields (10 *wei* is about 3 *mu*), all of which was rented out, yielding 2 *shi* of rent annually. In the past, he was mistakenly classified as a rich peasant兼middle merchant, and his industrial and commercial property was confiscated. After the Citizens' Group studied the situation, his class status was changed to handicraftsman, and all the confiscated property was returned. When Guo received his property back, he happily said, "After the New Year, I will hire workers and apprentices and start work as soon as possible." In addition, the Suide Yihe City had registered and taken over the goods of several shops owned by landlords also engaged in commerce, such as Liu Shaoxiong and Li Jiaji, causing concern among merchants in the city. After the work team discovered this, they immediately corrected the situation and returned the received goods to their original owners one by one. At first, the farmers were unwilling to return the goods, but after patient persuasion, the farmers finally realized that protecting industry and commerce and prospering the market was completely in line with their long-term interests, so they voluntarily returned the goods. Now the merchants' morale is high, and the market has become even more prosperous.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: In the land reform in Zhenchuan City (under Zhenchuan County) in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, industry and commerce are effectively protected and supported. Shen Laoqi, Hao Liangcai, and Du Yujun in the city were all landlords and major fur merchants. During the land reform, only their land was confiscated and distributed to the masses, while their commercial part was left untouched. All merchants are currently operating as usual. Dozens of poor merchants were allocated houses from public housing and confiscated landlord property. For example, Yang Wenhuan's family of five came here from Henan twenty years ago to do business and never bought a shop or house. This time, they were allocated two shopfront houses. Small merchants Gao Shouren and Cao Youqing joined the peasant association, and Gao Shouren was elected as a fruit distribution committee member. Now the city's commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous.

  　坚决保护工商业
  　改正错订成份退还错误没收货物
    【新华社西北廿五日电】陕甘宁边区各地坚决保护工商业，退还错误没收的工商业，并改正错订为地主富农的商人成份。米脂银城市曾将兼有土地的商人误订为地主及富农并没收其工商业，引起一般商人恐惧，把货物藏起来，经市民委员会研究并召开市民会讨论解释后，一一纠正。如吕崇川全家十五口人，全年开支粗粮廿四石左右，有川地十八垧，山地七垧，皆出租，每年约收租子粗粮三石，另外开一个铜铺，完全自做自卖，全年收入超过粗粮二十一石，占其生活来源的主要部分，过去误订为地主并没收其工商业，现改订成份为手工业者兼有封建剥削，并按不论地主与否，工商业一律保护的原则，被没收的商店货物全部退还，仅将其大部分土地抽出，分给群众，并仍留给他两垧菜地。又如艾绅华主要靠小杂货铺维持生活，有地十七垧，全部出租，过去误订为富农，现改为商人，改正后艾即自动向工作团讲出他在外区隐藏货物，要求写介绍信去取回重整营业。绥德市五区郭庆丰全家五口人有织布机五架（二架系伙织）除自家一人参加劳动外，另有雇工三人，学徒三人，并开设店铺，另有川地二垧半水地二堆（一○为八堆约三亩），全部出租，每年收租二石。过去误订为富农兼中等商人，没收其工商业，经市民小组研究后，改订成份为手工业者，被没收的财物全部退还。当郭收回财物时高兴的说：“过罢年就雇工人学徒，赶快开工”。另绥德义合市曾将地主兼营商业的刘绍雄李家吉等几家商店的货物登记接收，引起该市商贩疑虑。工作组发觉后立即加以纠正，把接收的货物一一归还原主，开始农民还不愿意退，经过了耐心说服，最后农民们认识到保护工商业繁荣市场，与他们的长远利益是完全符合的，便自动退了出来，现商贩情绪高涨，集市已更加繁荣。
    【新华社西北二十五日电】陕甘宁边区镇川市（镇川县属）土改中切实保护工商业并予扶助。该市申老七、郝良才和杜聿骏都是地主兼皮毛大商，土改中仅将他们的土地没收分给群众，其商业部分全部未动，各商现均照常营业。几十家穷困的商贩并从公房及没收地主财产中分得房屋。如杨文焕全家五口人，二十年前由河南来此经商，始终没有买下铺面和房子，这次分到了两间铺面房子。小商人高守仁、曹又清参加了农会，高守仁并被选为果实分配委员。现该市商业日趋繁荣。
