Coming from Workers and Peasants, Returning to Workers and Peasants
Comrade Wang Yizhi Reflects on Forgetting His Roots
One of the Reflections at the Rectification Meeting of the Sixth District Committee
Comrade Wang Yizhi is from Dongzhuang Village, Third District, Pingshun, born into a poor peasant family. He started working in 1943, joined the Party in October 1945, and is currently the Deputy Secretary of the First District Committee of Cixian County.

    My family is from Dongzhuang Village, Pingshun. My father always farmed and reclaimed mountains, working as a farmhand for others. There were more than twenty people in the family, and we owed a lot of debt. When I was five years old, I and my uncles separated from my grandfather’s family. My parents, my younger brother, and I had four people, four sheng of rice, three huts (my grandfather still occupied one), and half a mu of dry land, relying on my father to sell his labor to make a living. When the harvest was bad, we couldn't make ends meet, so we took 32 yuan of silver from the landlord Wang Shaozhong and Liu Shichang, and more than two shi of grain from the landlord's granary. Everything we divided was used to pay interest, and the land was mortgaged. When I was ten years old, I and my father herded livestock for others. Later, I had a younger brother and a younger sister, and they also herded cattle. I herded cattle for fifteen years until 1943 when no one needed me anymore. My father starved to death. I herded cattle for ten years, and when the cattle died, the landlord scolded me terribly, so I stopped herding cattle. After the age of twenty, I became a village clerk, learned to write in ten months, and then served as village head for more than two years. At the age of twenty-four, I went out to work (in 1943) and joined the Communist Party in 1945.
    In my work, I liked to show off, express myself, pursue formalism, and pay attention to superficial forms. Wherever I worked, I first wanted to put on a show on the surface. After a grievance meeting, my class consciousness became clearer. When I first arrived in Nanguan, Cixian County, to do rent reduction work, I looked for broken houses to live in and approached poor people. Because the living standards in the city were high, and my own living standards changed, I forgot my roots, forgot that I used to eat chaff and suffer. The idea of enjoying life gradually developed. For example, when I got married, the village cadres gave gifts. At first, I didn't want them, but it wasn't because I consciously realized that I was a Communist Party member and shouldn't take things from the people, but because I was afraid of making mistakes and being criticized by my superiors. The cadres said it again and again, and I always said no on the surface. The cadres went to the school and talked to Director Li. Later, Director Li said that they insisted on giving, so I should take some. I accepted the superior's words, felt it was legitimate, and accepted some things from the cadres, some were fruits, and some were bought by the cadres themselves. After getting married, I wanted to go home and see my mother, using the excuse of seeing my mother, but actually wanting everyone to see that I was married. Later, I asked my superiors, and Comrade Chai Shouyue said: Let your mother move here to live. I chatted with other comrades in this way, which suited my intentions. I wanted to move my mother here to live and divide some paddy fields for my younger brother to cultivate, so that he could have a better life than in the mountains. So I divided two mu and three fen of land. I wrote two letters to my mother, but she didn't come, so I asked the people to cultivate the land for me to support my wife's schooling, exploiting the labor of the people, entirely for my personal enjoyment, regardless of the suffering of the masses. When I saw a lot of good fruits in Xingli Street, I envied them, but I didn't want to be caught taking them, fearing criticism from my superiors, so I avoided going to the fruits. This avoided the phenomenon of grabbing a handful. In the end, I still grabbed a little and returned it when resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Seeing that everyone else was riding bicycles, but I didn't have one, I got a bicycle from a fleeing landlord when I worked in Xingren Street and rode it around. Seeing Secretary Xie salute at the meeting, I didn't learn from his good experience, but only learned his superficial form. When I became the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, I immediately made a military uniform to use at the meeting, wanting the masses to look up to me. When distributing fruits in Xingli Street, I didn't go deep into the poor people to understand the situation, but only listened to the words of the cadres and activists. In order to put on a good show in form, I produced personal heroism and serious sectarianism. Everyone at the meeting was raised to a higher level, and everyone not at the meeting was lowered to a lower level. Family members of those at the meeting who were not at the meeting were also lowered by one level. Except for the objects of struggle, landlords and rich peasants, all dependents of martyrs were raised by one level. Cadres and militiamen were given an extra share. Believing that the work was led and done by me, and that the cadres were trained by me, I only trusted them and myself, followed the rich peasant line, and the poor and hired peasants have not yet been thoroughly liberated. When expanding the army in Xingli Street, I didn't get a banner, so I expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership. The masses saw me expressing opinions and believed me, and they were also dissatisfied with the leadership. Later, I made another banner, and I was very happy, running to Nanguan to give the cadres good news. Looking at it today, I actually played the role of leading factionalism. In Dunhua Street, although party member Zhao ×× was born into a poor peasant family, he later degenerated, sheltered landlords, and occupied more fruits. District Chief Dai criticized him, and I felt that he was a party member and shouldn't be treated that way. I even explained to him: He doesn't understand you, he doesn't know you are a party member. This kind of education made him feel that party members are a head higher than the masses, blurred the truth of criticism and self-criticism within the party, created a factionalism between the party and the masses, and alienated us from the masses. Where I worked, the cadres I trained only thought he was good and couldn't see his shortcomings. I praised him a lot and promoted him a lot, wanting everyone to see that he was a cadre I trained. If he had shortcomings, I criticized him behind his back, fearing that everyone would see that my cadre was not good, and I would not be glorious either. When it came to the joint defense work, I only cared about that joint defense, regardless of the overall situation. Making the area I controlled good was my leadership's credit. I only helped and praised the cadres there a lot, thinking they were making rapid progress, which was my personal glory, instead of proceeding from the interests of the revolution. I engaged in textile production in order to create a typical example, to show everyone how capable I was, instead of solving the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. After it started, I mobilized all the villages to come and see, thinking that I did it, it was really amazing. As a result, two groups borrowed 400,000 yuan from the cooperative, and the difficulties of the entire poor and hired peasants in the village were still not solved. I regarded the Party as a sectarian group, using the Party to maintain my own reputation and status. With all the above ideas of planning for personal fame and fortune, I forgot my roots, forgot the poor and hired peasants, and blurred my class consciousness. For example, my wife was a maid for a landlord and suffered a lot of oppression. There was a landlord's daughter-in-law who lived with my wife. Although I told my wife and the village cadres: She is a landlord, she can't be of one heart with us; but in fact, for my own benefit, feeling that my wife was young, and in order to have her take care of my wife, I actually lived with her. The masses saw her living with my family and didn't fight her, and she became her "air-raid shelter." Last autumn, I felt it was inappropriate and separated from her, but I didn't realize that I had already become the landlord's "air-raid shelter." Only this time, I clarified this issue and realized that I had lost my stance. After autumn, Comrade ××× married the landlord's daughter Xie Ruying. I talked to him and learned that her history was not good. Her brother had run to the south, and she was a landlord. I raised objections to him. But he said it was nothing, she couldn't shake me. The superior also agreed. I also wanted to make a good impression on him, so I didn't proceed from class interests, didn't stand firm on my position, and compromised with him, losing my position, and helping him become the landlord's "air-raid shelter," causing dissatisfaction among the masses and opposition from cadres at all levels, and damaging the Party's reputation. This study has given me a preliminary understanding of the personal heroism in my work, which is entirely for my own enjoyment and fame, producing a serious sectarian style of thought, endangering the interests of the poor and hired peasant class. This time, I will resolutely return the things (fruits) taken from the masses to the masses, admit my mistakes to the masses, sincerely accept the criticism of the masses, and in the future, I will honestly stand on the Party's position, humbly learn from the masses, and be a farmhand for the people.

    王一之同志反省忘本思想
    六地委整党会上反省之一
    王一之同志，平顺三区东庄村人，贫雇出身，四三年参加工作，四五年十月入党，现任磁县一区分委副书记。
    我家是平顺东庄村人。父亲一直种地开山，给别人代种地。家有二十来口人，欠人家外债很多。我五岁上就和伯父叔父分了家，有父母、我和弟弟四口人，分了四升米，三间平房（还叫祖父占一间），半亩旱地，依靠父亲卖劳力维持生活。年景不好，顾不住，揭了地主王绍中、刘世昌三十二元现洋，又揭仓谷和地主的谷子两石多，把家里分的东西都打了利，地被押了。我十岁上就和我父亲给人揽牲口放，以后有了一个弟弟、一个妹妹，也是放牛。一直放到四三年，没人用才不放了，一共放了十五年。父亲饿死了。我放牛十年，给人家跌死牛，老财骂的不行，我不放牛了。二十岁以后当了村公所通讯员，十个月学会写字，又当村长二年多，二十四岁出来参加了工作（一九四三年），一九四五年参加共产党。
    我在工作中好出风头，表现自己，锦标主义，讲究表面形式。到哪里工作，首先就想在表面搞一套。经过一次诉苦，阶级觉悟比较有些明确。刚到磁县南关做减租工作，还找破房子住，接近的都是穷人。因城市生活水平高，自己生活水平改变了，就忘了本，忘记了自己从前吃糠菜受罪，享乐思想逐渐的发展起来。如结婚时村干部给送礼，首先不要，但思想也不是自觉到自己是个共产党员，不应要老百姓的东西，而是怕犯了错误，受上级批评。干部再三说，自己表面上总是说不要。干部到学校找李主任说，后来李主任说他们非给不行就要些吧，自己接了上级这个口气，就感觉合法了，就收了干部一些东西，有的是果实，有的是干部自买的。结婚后就想和老婆回家看看，借口是看母亲，但实际上是叫大家看看我结了婚啦。以后向上级要求，柴守约同志说：叫你母亲搬在这里住吧，向别的同志闲扯也这样说，就合了自己的意，想把母亲搬这里住，分些水地叫弟弟种，比在山里过的时光更好些，于是就分了二亩三分地。给母亲写了二次信，结果没来，就把地叫老百姓给代耕，供给自己老婆上学，剥削老百姓的劳力，完全为了个人享受打算，就不顾群众的痛苦了。在兴礼街看到好果实很多，就羡慕，但不愿落个抓取果实，怕上级批评，只好不到果实边去看，这样避免自己抓一把现象。结果还抓了一点，解决干群关系时才退回去。看人家都骑车子，自己没有，到兴仁街工作就搞了逃亡地主个车子，游游荡荡的就骑开了。看谢政委开会讲话敬礼，我不学人家好的经验，光学他的表面形式，我当了分委书记，马上做了一身军装，准备开会使用，想叫群众看起我。在兴理街分果实，不深入贫苦人了解情况，光听干部积极分子的话，为落我能在形式上搞一套的好，产生了个人英雄和严重的宗派主义思想。凡在会的人都提高一等，不在会的都降低一等。在会的人家属不在会也降低一等。除地主富农斗争对象外，凡抗属都加一等。干部民兵多分一份。认为工作是我领导搞的，干部是我培养的，光相信他们和自己，走了富农路线，使贫雇到现在还未得到彻底翻身。在兴礼街扩兵没得到锦标，就对领导上提出不满意见，群众看到我提意见就相信我，也对领导不满。后来又重做了一个锦标，自己就很高兴，跑到南关给干部报喜信。今天看，我实际起了领导宗派的作用。在敦化街党员赵××虽贫雇出身，以后蜕化了，包庇地主，多占果实，戴区长批评了他一顿，我就感到是党员，不应当。还给他解释说：他对你不了解，不知你是个党员，这样教育使他感到党员都比群众高一头，在党内模糊了批评和自我批评的真理，造成党与群众的宗派，脱离群众。我在那里工作，培养的干部只认为他好，看不出他的毛病，对他表扬也多，提拔也多，叫大家看看是我培养的干部。有了缺点在背地批评他，怕大家看见我的干部不好，自己也不光荣。到那个联防工作，只对那个联防关心，不顾全面，把我霸的一块搞好，是我领导的功劳。只对那里干部帮助多，表扬多，觉得他们进步快，是我个人的光荣，而不是从革命利益出发。搞纺织是为了搞个典型，叫大家看看我有多能干，而不是为解决贫雇困难，搞起以后就发动各村都来看，心想是我搞的，实在了不起，结果两个小组就在合作社贷了四十万元，村上整个贫雇的困难，还是没有解决。我把党看成一个宗派集团，利用党来维护自己的名誉地位。有了以上一切为个人名利打算的想法，就忘了本，忘了贫雇，模糊了自己的阶级意识。如我老婆是地主的使女，很受压迫，有个地主的儿媳，与我老婆在一块生活，我虽和我老婆及村干部说：她是地主，不能和咱一条心；但实际上为自己利益打算，感到自己老婆小，为叫她给照管老婆，竟和她在一块生活。群众看见与我家在一块就没把她斗了，结果当了她的“防空洞”。去年秋天感到不合适，与她分离了，但并没认识到已做了地主的“防空洞”，这次学习才明确了这个问题，是丧失立场的。秋后×××同志和地主女儿谢如英结婚，我和他谈话，了解到她历史不好，她哥跑到南边了，又是地主成份，就给他提出不同意见。但他说没啥，她动摇不了我。上级也同意了。自己也想在他面前落好，就不从阶级利益出发，不坚定自己的立场，向他妥协，丧失了自己的立场，帮他当了地主的“防空洞”，造成了群众不满，各级干部反对，损害了党的名誉。这次学习，初步认识了我在工作中的个人英雄主义，是完全为了自己享乐名利出发，产生了严重的宗派主义思想作风，违害了贫雇阶级利益。这次回去要把抓取群众的东西（果实），坚决退给群众，向群众承认错误，诚心诚意的接受群众的批评，今后要老老实实站在党的立场上，虚心向群众学习，给人民当一个长工。
