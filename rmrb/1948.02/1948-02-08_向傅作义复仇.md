    Avenge Fu Zuoyi
    Yang Shuo

    On the thirtieth day of the lunar year of 1947, I followed the army to the Laiishui and Zhuoxian area of the Pinghan North Line. It was just twelve days after Fu Zuoyi came to power and directed the bandit soldiers and generals of the Ninety-Fourth Army to burn and loot in this area. The affected people, when they saw the People's Liberation Army, said with tears in their eyes: "Alas! If you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to live." In An'yang Village, eighteen miles north of Laishui, many old people, children, and women rushed to tell the soldiers: The bandit army, greedy at the sight of anything, had arrested their sons, husbands, and brothers, etc. Before they could say a few words, they began to sob and cry together, asking the soldiers to avenge them. Taking An'yang Village as an example, out of the three hundred households in the whole village, one hundred and four houses were burned, more than seventy people were arrested, their whereabouts unknown, and a lot of food and belongings were looted. The old and childless couple, Wang Zongjiang, only had an old cotton quilt left. In the cold winter, the old woman sat on the kang, wrapped in the quilt, and cursed: "These damned beasts, they want everything, shameless!" Speaking of the burning situation, Sun Shigong's woman said with a trembling voice: "As soon as the bandit army entered the house, they shouted 'Light it! Light it!' Once it was lit, the wind howled, and the house was filled with black smoke, blocking the sun. Watching the family property burn to ashes, we weren't allowed to save it." The villagers ran away when they heard the news. Liu Shuan's sister, who was at home, was shot because she couldn't run away. Those who were captured alive were imprisoned in Laishui City, and it cost dozens of dan of grain to redeem one person. When they were being tied up, the bandit army said: "You have five days to redeem them, or else you will come and carry the dead bodies." Old woman Niu, who was over sixty years old, risked her life to send food to her son, Niu Jinhai. When she saw him, he was no longer human. His face was the color of mud, the ice on his beard was three or four inches long, and his cotton coat had been stripped off. He was shivering in a cold cellar and couldn't speak. There was also an open pit, the bottom of which was frozen into ice with splashed water. People were forced to squat down barefoot. Gao Yu＠, who was sixty-seven years old and had a stubborn personality, was stripped to only a set of underwear, half of his body was buried in the ground and splashed with water, and he was wearing a cangue around his neck. He was frozen and starved to death in a few days. Also, the two daughters-in-law of Sun Chengfeng's family were arrested and ran back after two days. When asked for details, they hated so much that they gritted their teeth and refused to say anything. Fu Zuoyi recently scolded the People's Liberation Army, saying: "Their evil is more obvious, and their crimes are more evident." This is exactly the crime he has defined himself. Now "Avenge Fu Zuoyi!" has become the passionate action of our army and people.

    向傅作义复仇
    杨朔
    一九四七年大年三十，记者随军来到平汉北线涞水、涿县一带，正当傅作义上台后，指使九十四军的贼兵贼将，在这一片大烧大抢的后十二天，受害的人民见到解放军，流着泪道：“唉！你们再不来，没法活了。”涞水以北十八里的安阳村，许多老幼妇女，赶着对战士诉说：见东西就眼红的匪军，怎样逮走了她的儿子、男人、哥哥等，说不几句，就呜咽起来，哭作一团，要战士替她们报仇。单拿安阳村来说，全村三百来户，便烧了一百零四间房子，逮起七十多人，死活不知，抢走粮食东西很多。王宗江老绝户夫妇只剩了一条旧棉被，隆冬数九，老太太坐在炕头上，裹着那条被骂道：“这些该死的牲口，什么都要，死不要脸！”讲到烧的情形，孙士工的女人颤着声音说：“匪军一进屋，就叫‘点火！点火！’一点火，风呼呼地，房子冒着黑烟，把日头都遮了，眼看家当烧成灰，也不许救。”村里人听见风声就跑，刘拴在家的妹子跑不及被崩了。活逮走的都囚在涞水城，一个人要几十石粮食去赎，临绑走匪军还说：“限五天来赎，不赎就来抬死尸。”六十多岁的牛大娘，冒着死去给儿子牛金海送吃的，一看早不象人样了，脸是泥皮色，胡子上的冰三四寸长，棉袄也叫人剥光，关在冷地窑里打哆嗦，话都不会说了。还有个露天大坑，坑底泼的水冻成冰，硬叫人赤着脚蹲在下边，六十七岁的高玉＠性子顽强，被剥得只剩一套单衣，下半身埋在地里泼上水，脖子上带着枷，不几天活活冻饿死了。又有孙程峰家的妯娌俩，被抓去两天又跑回来，问他们细情，恨得咬着牙不肯明言。傅作义最近曾骂解放军说：“其恶益著，其罪益彰。”正是自定的罪状。现在“向傅作义复仇！”已经是我军民激昂的行动了。
