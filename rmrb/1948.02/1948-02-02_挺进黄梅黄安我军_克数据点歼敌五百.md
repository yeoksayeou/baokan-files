(2) Another unit of the People's Liberation Army routed the 58th Division of the Chiang bandits who were fleeing towards the Shangcheng area on the 27th, inflicting heavy casualties on them. (3) A unit of the People's Liberation Army, on the 19th and 20th, launched separate surprise attacks on the enemy strongholds of Guyuling, south of Qiliping, and Huitong Temple, east of Lindian, within Huang'an, capturing more than 40 bandits and weapons from the Chiang bandit 28th Division's plainclothes team, killing and wounding more than 100 people. Furthermore, they captured more than 350 local Chiang bandits, seizing a quantity of military supplies.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 28th: The battle of Deng County: Deng County is the first large reactionary fortress of the Chiang bandits in the four counties west of Wan (Nanyang) (Zhenping, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Deng County), and the center of the local landlord and local tyrant reactionary forces. The city was occupied by the second detachment of the joint defense of Zhenping, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Deng counties of the Chiang bandit Henan Provincial Self-Defense Headquarters, a total of eleven security regiments and one directly subordinate battalion, more than 8,000 people. In order to make this fortress even stronger, the Chiang bandits built a five-foot high and three-foot wide barricade outside the two city walls (the city is five li in circumference, and the outer city is twenty-five li in circumference). Bunkers were built under the wall, and the barricade was surrounded by deer fences. Trenches connected the city wall and the barricade, and the water in the outer moat was connected to the water outside the inner city. The Chiang bandit army shrank into this tortoise shell. On the 9th, this large reactionary fortress was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. The Chiang bandits were very flustered and sent more than a dozen planes to bomb the People's Liberation Army positions day and night, and to deliver ammunition to the besieged Chiang bandit army. The People's Liberation Army first destroyed the sluice gate of the outer moat, releasing most of the water in the outer moat. The general offensive was launched at 5 p.m. on the 15th. Under the cover of our powerful artillery fire, the commanders and fighters waded through the water trenches up to their chests, climbed up the city wall, and occupied the outer city in just five minutes. That night, all the enemies in the outer city were wiped out. At dawn on the 16th, they attacked the inner city. Except for a few Chiang bandit troops who jumped into the water and fled, more than 1,000 were killed or drowned, and the remaining 5,600 were all captured. After the People's Liberation Army siege of Deng County began, the people within dozens of miles around the city automatically organized stretcher teams to carry all the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to the hospital. Some people even brought chickens to the hospital to express their sympathy.

    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十八日电】解放邓县战斗经过：邓县是宛（南阳）西四县（镇平、内乡、淅川、邓县）蒋匪第一个大的反动堡垒，又是当地地主土豪反动力量的中心。城里盘据着蒋匪河南省自卫总队镇、内、淅、邓等县联防第二支队，共十一个保安团和一个直属大队八千多人，蒋匪为使这座堡桑更加坚固，曾在两道城墙（城周围五里，外城周围二十五里）外筑有五尺高三尺宽的拦马墙，墙下修有地堡群，墙外围起鹿砦，城墙与拦马墙间挖有交通壕，外壕水又与内城外面的水相连，蒋匪军就缩在这个乌龟壳里。九号，这个大的反动堡垒被解放军包围了，蒋匪十分着慌，派十几架飞机日夜轮番轰炸解放军阵地，并给被围的蒋匪军投送弹药。解放军首先炸毁了外壕的水闸，把外壕里的水放去大半。十五日下午五时发起总攻，在我强大的炮火掩护下，指战员们涉过深及胸部的水壕后，爬上城墙，仅五分钟就占领了外城的城头，当晚就把外城的敌人全部肃清。十六日拂晓，攻入内城，除少数蒋匪军跳水逃散外，被打死或淹死的一千多人，剩下的五千六百人全部被俘。当解放军围攻邓县战斗开始后，城周围几十里以内的老百姓，都自动组织了担架队，把解放军的伤员全部抬运到医院去，有的人还带着鸡到医院去进行慰问。
