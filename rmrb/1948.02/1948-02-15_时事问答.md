    Which Eastern Countries Exist in the World?
    Editor Comrade:
        We are learning from Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," paragraph one, line fifteen, which says: "Also because this event occurred in the East of the world, where there are more than one billion people (accounting for half of humanity)..." Besides China's 450 million people, these more than 550 million people are from which Eastern countries? What countries are included in the East? Where are these places and how many people live there? Because I am from a poor peasant background and did not go to school, I only learned a few characters after joining our revolutionary ranks. Therefore, I am not clear about the map of the world. Please reply and help me.
        Ma Fang, Xinxiang County Public Security Bureau

    [Answer] The more than one billion oppressed people in the East that Chairman Mao mentioned in his report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" refers to the 550 million people in countries such as Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Siam (Thailand), Vietnam, Burma, and India, in addition to China's 450 million people. The people of these countries all regard our liberated areas as their big brother, as their good friend and role model in striving for liberation. The influence of Mao Zedong Thought is expanding among the people of these countries day by day. Now, let's briefly discuss the population and democratic forces of these countries:

    India, located southwest of China, bordering China's Xinjiang and Tibet, has a population of over 380 million. The Communist Party of India is one of the three major political parties in the country (the other two are the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League), with more than 53,000 members, and is an important force leading the Indian people's independence and democratic movement and uniting the Indian and Muslim masses. (Note: Due to the interference of British imperialism, India has unfortunately been divided into two states, India and Pakistan.)

    Japan, located east of China (separated by a vast ocean), has a population of over 72.22 million. The Japanese Communist Party has 60,000 members and enjoys high prestige among the Japanese people, leading the Japanese people's democratic movement.

    Korea, connected to our Northeast Liberated Area's Andong Province (separated only by the Yalu River), has a population of over 22.89 million. North and South Korea were previously occupied by Japan. After defeating Japan, they were controlled by Soviet and American troops. The Soviet Union occupied the northern half, and the American troops occupied the southern half. The two places are a clear contrast between democracy and reaction. The people of North Korea have implemented land reform and have gained democratic freedom, while the people of South Korea are still suffering from heavy oppression and exploitation due to the support of American imperialism for reactionaries. The Korean Communist Party has 50,000 members, leading the North Korean democratic government. The people of South Korea are also constantly launching democratic movements against oppression and striving for freedom.

    Vietnam, connected to China's southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, has a population of 21.45 million. Viet Cong leader Ho Chi Minh leads the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in fighting French imperialism.

    Burma, bordering China's southwestern Tibet and Yunnan provinces, and India to the west, has a population of 14 million. The Burmese Communist Party has 6,000 members, leading the country's "Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League," resisting British imperialism and striving for independence.

    Siam (Thailand), located between Burma and Vietnam, bordering China's Yunnan Province to the north, has a population of 11.5 million. Due to the strength of the people's forces, the government was forced to abolish the "Anti-Communist Law" last year, and the Siamese Communist Party has become a legal political party.

    The Philippines, located southeast of Guangdong Province (across the sea), has a population of 10.31 million and is an "independent country" under the leadership of the United States (just like the "Manchukuo" of the past). However, the Philippine People's Guerrilla Force led by the Philippine Communist Party is resolutely fighting against the counter-revolutionary Roxas government. There are many overseas Chinese in the People's Guerrilla Force.

    Indonesia, located further south than the Philippines, is a group of small islands in the vast ocean, previously occupied by the Netherlands and Japan, with a population of 70 million. The Indonesian Communist Party has 35,000 members, leading the Indonesian People's Liberation Army in fighting Dutch imperialism and striving for independence.

    Malaya, located south of Siam, opposite Sumatra Island in Indonesia, has a population of 4.4 million. There are many overseas Chinese and is still under British imperialist rule and oppression. The Malayan Communist Party has 16,000 members and leads the Malayan people in constant anti-British struggles.

  What is a "Flame Thrower"?
    Editor Comrade:
        The People's Daily on February 1st published the People's Liberation Army Headquarters' announcement of the December war achievements on the first page, and the term "flame thrower tool" was among the captured items. This term is constantly being published in the newspaper, but I only know that it is a weapon, but I don't know what form it takes, nor do I know how much of a role it can play in combat. Sometimes when reading the newspaper to the masses, the masses constantly ask what this weapon is, and I don't understand it myself, so I can't answer them. Please help me answer it.
        Wang Zhichao, Teacher of Lujia Xiaotun

    (Answer) Flame throwers are available in four types: light, medium, heavy, and special. Ordinary ones are mounted on large trucks, with only one unit per truck. Sometimes it is mounted on a tank, which is called a flame-throwing tank. Its structure is very complex, and it is impossible to explain its appearance here. Roughly speaking, it is a machine with a mixture of several kinds of chemicals. This machine can spray this chemical far away. As soon as this chemical comes out, it catches fire when it hits the air. When it is fired, it makes a whooshing sound, and it sprays out a long flame and a trail of smoke. Heavy flame throwers can spray 80 meters (more than 20 zhang) away, and the maximum firing time is one and a half minutes; light ones can spray 10 meters to 40 meters away, and the firing time can be 20 seconds to 40 seconds. After firing, it takes a long time to reload the chemical before it can be fired again. Because it doesn't spray very far and the time is not long, the lethality is not very great. However, when it suddenly rushes in front of the opponent and the opponent is not mentally prepared, and does not understand such a thing, it will feel threatened in spirit. In addition, because it is very bulky, difficult to move, and very complex, the user must receive a long period of technical training, and it is not easy to replenish after being killed or injured. It also needs to be used with the wind, otherwise it cannot be used. This weapon is suitable for melee combat and night combat, and requires strong infantry to cover it; Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are not good at this, so even if they get this new type of weapon given to them by their American daddy, it is not very useful, at most it plays a supplementary role, and it cannot play a major role in the victory or defeat of the entire battle.

    Our People's Liberation Army is good at melee combat and night combat, and has strong infantry. If we get this weapon, it can be helpful in attacking strongholds when fighting in cities. We captured a total of eight units in the second half of last year; when we eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's main force, the 74th Division, in Menglianggu, Shandong, we captured twelve units at once, and we also got three units when we fought Chiang Kai-shek's 83rd Division in Lunan last summer.

    时事问答
    同志们读报纸上的时事消息有什么困难没有？哪些地方有疑问？希望大家有问题就写出来寄给我们，我们一定尽力为大家解决读报的困难。
  ——编者
  世界的东方都有哪些国家编辑同志：
    我们学习毛主席报告“目前形势和我们的任务”头一段第十五行说：“还因为这个事变发生在世界的东方，在这里共有十万万以上人口（占人类一半）……”这十万万以上人口除了中国四万万五千万人口外，还有五万万五千万以上人口，是东方哪些国家的人口？东方都包括哪几个国家？哪些地方有多少人口？因为我是贫农出身，没有上过学，就是来到咱革命阵营里才学了几个字；所以对世界上地图上弄不明确，请答复帮助为盼。
      新乡县公安局马芳
    【答】毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”报告中所说的东方十万万以上被帝国主义压迫的人口，是指的除了中国四万万五千万人外，还有朝鲜、日本、菲律滨、印度尼西亚、马来亚、暹罗（泰国）、越南、缅甸和印度等国家的五万万五千多万人。这些国家的人民都把咱们解放区当作他们的老大哥，当作他们争取解放的好朋友和好榜样，毛主席思想影响在这些国家的人民中间正一天比一天扩大。现在分别把这些国家的人口及民主势力简单说一下：
    印度，在中国的西南边，挨着中国的新疆和西藏。有三万万八千多万人民。印度的共产党是该国三大政党之一（另二大党是印度国大党和回教同盟），有共产党员五万三千多人，是领导印度人民的独立民主运动和团结印、回两教群众的重要力量。（按：由于英帝从中捣鬼，印度现已不幸被分为印度与巴基斯坦两个邦。）
    日本，在中国的东边（隔着一片大海），有七千二百二十二万多人。日本共产党有六万党员，在日本人民中的威信很高，是日本人民民主运动领导者。
    朝鲜，和咱们东北解放区安东省相连接（只隔一条鸭绿江），有二千二百八十九万多人。鲜北和鲜南过去被日本侵占，把日本打败后是苏军和美军管制着，苏联占北半部，美军占南半部。两处是民主与反动的鲜明的对照，鲜北人民实行土地改革，已得到民主自由，而鲜南由于美帝国主义扶持反动派，人民仍受着重重压迫，层层剥削的痛苦。朝鲜共产党已有五万党员，领导鲜北民主政府。鲜南人民也不断掀起反压迫争自由的民主运动。
    越南，和中国西南的云南、广西两省相连，人口有二千一百四十五万。越共领袖胡志明同志领导着越南人民共和国，对法帝国主义战斗。
    缅甸，挨着中国西南的西藏和云南省、西边和印度相连；人口一千四百万。缅共有党员六千，领导该国“反法西斯人民自由联盟”，反抗英帝国主义，争取独立。
    暹罗（泰国），在缅甸和越南的中间，北边跟中国云南省相连，人口有一千一百五十万，由于人民力量强大，政府前年被迫废除“反共法案”，暹共已成合法政党。
    非律滨，在广东省东南边（隔着海）。人口一千零三十一万是美国领导下的“独立国”（就象过去的“满洲国”那样的“独立国”。）但菲共领导下的菲律滨人民游击队正与反革命的罗哈斯政府作坚决斗争。在人民游击队中有很多华侨。
    印度尼西亚，比菲律滨还靠南，是大海洋里的一群小岛，过去曾被荷兰和日本占领，有七千万人口。印尼共产党有三十五名党员，领导印尼人民解放军和荷兰帝国主义战斗，争取独立。
    马来亚，在暹罗南边，和印尼的苏门答腊岛相对。有四百四十万人，有很多华侨，仍受英帝统治压迫。马来亚共产党有一万六千党员领导马来亚人民不断作着反英斗争。
  “火焰喷射器”是什么东西编辑同志：
    二月一日的人民报上第一版登载着人民解放军总部公布十二月份战绩，缴获里有“火焰喷射器工具”这个名词在报纸上不断的登载，但是只知道是一种武器，不知到是啥形式，也不知道在战斗中能起多大作用，有时给群众读报，群众不断问这是啥武器，自己也不了解无法给群众解答，请你们帮助解答一下为盼。
            吕家小屯教员王智超
    （答）火焰喷射器有轻型、中型、重型和特种类型四种；普通是装在大汽车上，一辆汽车只能装一具。有时把它装在坦克车上，就叫喷火坦克。它的构造很复杂，样子在这里说也说不明白。大概说来是一套机器里面着几种东西混合起来的药水，这机器能把这药水喷出来喷得很远。这药水一出来，碰到空气就会着起火来。在放射的时候，呼呼的响着，就喷出很长的火焰和一溜烟。重型喷火器能喷八十公尺（廿多丈）远，放射时间最长能放一分半钟；轻型的能喷十公尺到四十公尺远，放射时间能有二十秒到四十秒钟。放射了得隔很久再装上药水才能再放射。因为喷射得并不远，时间也不长，杀伤力是不很大的。只不过在它忽然冲到对方面前而对方思想上没有准备，对这样一个家伙不了解的时候，就会在精神上感到威胁。另外，因为它很笨重，不易运动；又很复杂，使用的人得受较长时期的技术训练，被杀伤后也不容易补充。放射的时候还要顺风，不顺风就不能用。这种武器适宜于打交手仗，打夜战，而且需要有坚强的步兵作掩护；蒋匪正不善于这一套，所以拿上这种他美国洋爸爸给他的这种新式武器也没多大用，顶多起一点辅助作用，对整个战斗的胜负起不了主要作用。
    而咱解放军则善于打交手仗，打夜战，又有坚强的步兵，拿到这种武器，在打城市时用它攻坚倒还可以有些帮助。去年下半年咱共缴获了八具；在山东孟良消灭蒋匪主力七十四师的时候，一次就缴获了十二具，去年夏天在鲁南打蒋匪八十三师的时候也得了三具。
