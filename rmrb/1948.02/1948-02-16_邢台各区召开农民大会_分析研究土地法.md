Xingtai Districts Convene Farmer Congresses to Analyze and Study Land Law

Around the 22nd day of the twelfth lunar month, all districts in Xingtai convened joint congresses of hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants. At these meetings, the Land Law was explained and analyzed in detail. It was emphasized that middle and poor peasants are brothers, and all farmers under heaven belong to one family, which alleviated the concerns of many middle and poor peasants and cadres. After returning to their villages, everyone studied and discussed the law every evening in winter schools, and much progress has been made.

After the publicity from this congress, the poor and hired laborers were very happy. Lian Zhenlin, a hired laborer from Niu Tian, 11th District, said at the congress: "I herded sheep for Landlord Mou for twenty-four years and worked for him for four years. Last winter, during the emancipation movement, our family of one was allocated five mu of land (one mu of paddy field and four mu of dry land). It sounds like a lot, but it's all sandy land where even dogs don't urinate. This year, it only yielded one dan of coarse grains. Not to mention clothes, we don't even have enough to eat, it's worse than herding sheep! Now that the land is being equally distributed, Chairman Mao wants us poor and hired laborers to hold power. We must ensure it is distributed fairly and not leave anyone in poverty."

Di Qihua, a hired laborer from Shangpo Village, 9th District, said: "During last year's movement, we hired laborers didn't really hold power, and we suffered losses. The appraisers were all eloquent people, and they and the cadres all looked upwards with 'wasp eyes'. Some good things were distributed to cadres and activists. We poor people didn't dare to say a single word of 'disagreement'. This time, we must firmly grasp the handle of the Land Law and thoroughly emancipate ourselves politically and economically."

During the study of the Land Law, the thinking of some cadres was also straightened out. Cao Xingjun, the political director of Xiaoge Village, 8th District, said: "Cadres who have taken too much of the fruits should voluntarily return them. If they admit their mistakes and correct them, the masses can forgive them. But if they stubbornly refuse to return them and refuse to admit their mistakes, they will definitely be opposed by the masses. This is a concrete departure from the masses, and it will not end well."

The suspicions of the middle peasants were also dispelled. After the congress, when studying the Land Law at the winter school in Shangpozi, well-to-do middle peasant Ma Liansheng said: "Previously, I only thought that last year we struggled against the landlords, and this year it would definitely be against the middle peasants. I was worried that the hired laborers would beat me up again, and I would lose both property and face. I had no motivation for production. Today, I was called to the meeting, and they said that all farmers under heaven are one family, that middle peasants and poor peasants are brothers, that the surplus wealth of well-to-do middle peasants would not be touched, that surplus land should be voluntarily given up, and that there would be no struggle. Previously, I didn't understand the Land Law, and I cut six or seven dan of firewood less." Zhehu used hired laborers as the backbone to unite with middle peasants to jointly study the Land Law, exposing the distortions and sabotage of bad elements. The middle peasants were then at ease, and well-to-do middle peasant Yao Wengong said: "I didn't understand the Land Law, and I ate half a pig." (From the "Organize" Small Newspaper)

### 邢台各区召开农民大会  分析研究土地法

    邢台各区召开农民大会
    分析研究土地法
    邢台各区在腊月二十二日前后，召开了雇贫中农联合大会，在会上详细讲解分析了土地法，并提出中贫农是弟兄，天下农民是一家，解除了不少中贫农和干部的顾虑。各村回去后，每天晚上又在冬学研究讨论，已获得不少成绩。
    经过这次大会宣传后，贫雇都非常高兴。十一区连牛田雇贫连贞林在大会上说：“我给侔地主放了二十四年羊，还做过四年活，去冬闹翻身咱一口人分给咱五亩地（水地一亩、旱地四亩）。听亩垄不少，都是狗尿不着的沙滩，今年只打了一石粗粮，别说穿衣裳，吃还不够，还不如放羊哩！这回平分土地，毛主席叫咱贫雇掌权，一定要叫他平平哩，不叫他有一个穷坑。”
    九区上坡村雇贫狄起华说：“去年运动反正咱雇贫没掌住权，吃了亏，评议员都是能说会道的人，和干部他们都是马蜂眼光往上看，有些好东西都分给了干部积极人，咱穷人敢说个‘不同意’三字，这回咱一定要掌住土地法的刀把子，在政治上，经济上把身翻的透透哩。”
    在研究土地法中，一部分干部的思想也打通了。八区小戈了政治主任曹兴俊说：“干部多占了果果实，要自动退出，有错改错群众能原谅，如坚决不退，有错不承认，定要受到群众的反对，这是具体脱离了群众，得不到好结果的。”
    中农的怀疑也打破了。会后上坡子在冬学研究土地法时，富裕中农马连生说：“先前我光想去年斗地主，今年一定是斗中农，我再叫雇贫打一顿，人财两丢，这多败兴，就没心思闹生产了，今天叫我开会，说天下农民是一家，中农贫农是弟兄，富裕中农的浮财分文不动，多余土地自愿拿出来，坚决不斗，先前我没闹通土地法，少打了六七担柴火。”折户以雇贫为骨干联合中农共同研究土地法，揭破了坏分子的曲解和破坏。中农才安心了，富裕中农姚文公说：“我没摸清土地法，吃了半个猪。”（“组织起来”小报）
