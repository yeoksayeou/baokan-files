    Political Director of Imperial Examinations Actually Forbids Poor and Hired Peasants from Buying Shares.
    [Taihang News] Comprehensive report from correspondents in Lucheng and other counties: Recently, during winter production, some village cadres not only did not lead production well, but also stood on the heads of the masses and shat and pissed on them. Hired and poor peasants suffered even greater oppression, and they urgently demanded that these stones be removed.
    One type of cadre is openly corrupt and wasteful. The political director of Wanglibao in Lucheng "mobilized" twenty people to "help" his brother get married for three days. These families had fifteen idle livestock and carts that could not be used for production. In addition, thirty relatives, men and women, "helped" for two days, also causing work delays. In total, in addition to his family’s "entertainment" waste of 133,000 yuan, he also wasted 120 man-days and 45 animal-days of the masses, losing 195,000 yuan. Even more unreasonable, he forced the masses to give "gifts" of 75,000 yuan. After the leadership discovered this, they sent Comrade Shen to the village to deal with it. Comrade Shen first sided with the masses, encouraging them to bravely speak out their grievances. Ren Fuwen, a "turned-over" household, said: "I didn't have money, so I had to borrow 500 yuan to give as a gift." Liu Liuchang and many other people said: "If we say we don't want to help with the wedding or give gifts, we're afraid they'll give us a hard time." Some said: "When ordinary people get married, the political director doesn't allow them to ride in a sedan chair, but when his brother got married, he even borrowed a sedan chair from another village." After the masses complained, Comrade Shen went to "get through" to the political director. In the end, the political director "reviewed" himself to everyone, saying: "It's too late to regret it, everyone should just suffer a bit, I will reform in the future." In this way, he deceived everyone, and the problem was "solved." Cadres in Xixiazhuang in the Second District of Xiuwu County secretly fabricated a list of hired and poor peasants, stamped their own fingerprints on it, and fraudulently obtained loans from the bank. They then returned and jointly engaged in speculative trading to make big money. The hired and poor peasants in the village had no food or drink, and wanted to produce but had no capital. They didn't care about them at all. Old peasant Wang Lao Han, with a family of seven, harvested 1.9 dan of corn last year. After repaying 0.4 dan of debt, the remaining grain was already eaten up. He wanted to engage in production, but couldn't do it without funds. The Keju Cooperative in Heshun County was established before last autumn. There were a total of three cadres, who only ate and didn't work. The political director, who was also the director of the cooperative, disliked delaying his work, so he found a landlord to replace him for a long time. Because hired and poor peasants had more shares in the cooperative than middle peasants, he encouraged middle peasants to buy more shares while restricting hired and poor peasants from buying shares. For every 10,000 yuan of shares, they would distribute dividends based on 5,000 yuan, or return 5,000 yuan. The money earned had to be split three-seven with them (referring to the cooperative cadres). This time, the three of them divided 150,000 yuan in dividends. The money borrowed from the bank was not distributed to the poor and hired peasants, but was used to buy two donkeys and place them in the cooperative for their use. He didn't find ways for the poor and hired peasants to produce, but instead arranged for four landlords to go out and produce. The hired and poor peasants had no place to complain, and only reflected in secret: "The village chief doesn't care about us, but he should be replaced (referring to the political director)!"
    Another type of cadre says they are for the hired and poor peasants, but secretly oppress them. Some bad cadres in Lijiayao in the Sixth District of Licheng County are doing their utmost to suppress the hired and poor peasant groups. Jiang Wenchang, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, said, "I must serve the hired and poor peasants in every way," but when the hired and poor peasant group passed a motion to lend Cao Quanlin, who had no clothes or quilts, 10,000 yuan, he stopped it. Later, the village chief found out and firmly decided to lend it to Quanlin. Jiang Fusuo, the deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee, didn't participate in production at all during the entire winter, only allowing the mutual aid group to allocate work points to him and receive wages in name only, but when it came time to settle accounts, he only gave him an IOU.
    Rich Peasant Becomes Manager, Moves His Entire Family into the Cooperative
    Yet another situation is where landlord and rich peasant elements have wormed their way in as cadres and continue to exploit the masses in disguised ways. In the Dongnao Cooperative in the Third District of Yushe County, the five cadres, including the director, deputy director, and accountant, are all rich peasants. The director, Zhang Sihuo, simply moved his wife and children into the cooperative to live, eating and drinking well every day with vermicelli and white flour. Needless to say, he didn't engage in business, but even drinking water and eating biscuits were served by the mill workers. Whenever he was idle, he went to the village to engage in corruption. The masses were extremely angry when they saw this, and raised some objections, but he scolded them in the people's school, saying, "This is a rumor spread by spies." After that, the masses didn't dare to say anything, but only said in secret: "How dare we provoke him? The village chief is also one of his people." To this day, the 180,000 yuan in shares invested by the masses, and the 130,000 yuan in dividends earned, have all been eaten and drunk up by Zhang Sihuo and others, and after adding in embezzlement, they have exploited everything clean. In the Dongjie Cooperative in the First District of Lucheng County, the landlord Lian Duoluo became the person in charge. The cadres always said he was an "enlightened" landlord, and he was never struggled against. The landlord Lian Duoluo controlled the cooperative for several months, holding 300,000 yuan in shares from the masses, without accounting or distributing dividends, secretly eating, drinking, embezzling, and wasting, while openly claiming to be losing money. Of course, there was no talk of supporting poor and hired peasants in production! The poor and hired peasants reflected: "We are short of capital for production, but the shares we invested are all supporting the landlords. We must squeeze them out!" In Yangjiaxigou in the Ninth District of Linxian County, the landlord Yang Yuqing is the finance and grain secretary. Not only does he not work a single day, but he also gets the equivalent of a war support worker, and has so far exploited the masses for 85 jin of millet. The logistics secretary, Yang Migui (a landlord), is the same as Yang Yuqing, exploiting the masses for 21 jin of war support rice. The hired and poor peasants are very dissatisfied and say: "We sweat and suffer, while they get rice just by sitting there."

    潞城等县坏干部压迫农民
    冬季生产没法闹
    科举政治主任，竟不叫贫雇入股。
    【太行消息】综合潞城等县通讯员来稿：最近在冬季生产中，有部分村干部不但不好好领导生产，还是站在群众头上屙屎撒尿。雇贫农民受压迫更厉害，他们急迫要求搬掉这些石头。
    有一种干部是公开的贪污浪费。潞城王里堡政治主任给他兄弟结婚，一共“动员”了二十个群众“帮忙”三天，这些群众家里却闲着十五头牲口和大车不能生产；另有四乡亲戚男女三十人“帮忙”，也误工两天；总共除他家“请客”浪费折洋十三万三千元外，还浪费了群众一百二十个人工，四十五个畜工，少赚洋十九万五千元；更无理的是硬让群众上了“礼钱”七万五千元。领导上事后发现了，派干部申同志到该村处理。申同志先给群众作主，让大胆诉苦。“翻身”户任富文说：“我没钱，只好借了五百元给人家上礼”。刘六昌等好多群众说：“咱说不给人家帮忙上礼吧，又怕人家给咱个不好看”。有的说：“老百姓结婚，政治主任不让坐轿，人家兄弟结婚，还到外村借轿坐。”群众诉苦后，申同志又去“打通”政治主任思想。最后，政治主任对大家“检讨”说：“后悔也赶不上啦，大家都吃点亏吧，今后我改造。”就这样欺骗了一顿，就算把问题“解决”了。修武二区西下庄干部，私下假造雇贫名单，自己盖上手印，到银行骗上贷款，回来合伙作投机买卖，赚大钱。村里的雇贫没吃喝，想生产没本钱，他们根本不管。老贫农王老汉，家里七口人，去年收了一石九斗玉茭，除还外帐四斗，余粮早已吃完，心想搞生产，没款不能干。和顺科举合作社是去年秋前成立的，一共三个干部，光吃不动。政治主任兼合作社社长，嫌误工，还找了一个地主给他长期顶工。因为雇贫在合作社入股比中农多，他就一面发动中农多入股，一面限制雇贫入股；入一万元股金的，按五千元分红，或给退回五千元。赚的钱还得和他们（指合作社干部）三七分红。这一次他三个人就分红十五万元。银行贷下的款，也不给贫雇分配，买了两头驴放在合作社，供他们使用。他不给贫雇找生产门路，却给四个地主安排出去生产。雇贫想到硝房干活，他不让，却吸收了地主。雇贫农有苦没处诉，只是背地反映：“村长也不管咱，可该撤换他（指政治主任）啦！”
    另有一种干部是嘴上说为雇贫，暗地却还压迫雇贫。黎城六区栗家窑有些坏干部，极力压制雇贫小组。农会常委江文昌，口里说“我处处都要为雇贫服务”，可是雇贫小组通过要给现在没穿没盖的曹全林贷一万元款，他就阻止不让；后来村长知道，才坚决作主，贷给了全林。武委会副主任江富锁，自己一冬天根本不参加生产，只让互助组给他拨工受，嘴说出工资，到结帐时只给打了个欠条。
    富农当了经理，把全家搬到合作社
    再有一种是地主富农分子，钻进来当了干部，继续变相的剥削群众。榆社三区东瑙合作社，正副经理会计等五个干部都是富农。正经理张四货干脆就把老婆孩子都搬到合作社住，每天粉条、白面等好吃好喝，不用说搞营业，喝水、吃饼干都是磨房工人伺候，一闲下就到村里搞腐化。群众看着恨的不行，提了些意见，反被他在民校骂了一顿，说：“这是特务造谣”。以后群众再也不敢吭啦，只是暗地说：“咱敢惹？村长也是人家的人。”至今群众入的十八万元股金，和赚的十三万元红利，都叫张四货等大吃二喝，加上贪污，剥削了个净光。潞城一区东街合作社，地主连多禄当了掌权，干部一直说他是“开明”地主，根本就没让斗过。地主连多禄掌握合作社好几个月，拿着群众三十万元股金，也不算帐分红，暗地吃喝贪污浪费，明面一直喊叫赔钱，当然更谈不上扶助贫雇生产啦！贫雇双全反映说：“咱生产缺本钱，可是入上股都养活了地主，非挤出不行！”林县九区杨家西沟，地主杨玉清当的是财粮书记，一天不动不用说，还顶一个战勤工，至今已剥削了群众小米八十五斤。后勤书记杨米贵（地主）也和杨玉清一样，剥削了群众二十一斤战勤米。雇贫农民非常不满的说：“咱流汗受罪，人家是坐着得米”。
