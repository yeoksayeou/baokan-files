    Helping Farmers Develop Production
    Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Distributes Large Amount of Agricultural Loans
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 13th] In order to help farmers develop production, the Border Region Finance and Economics Office has decided to allocate 90,000 *dashi* of grain and 50 billion Border Region currency (each yuan equivalent to approximately eight yuan of Kuomintang currency) throughout the entire Border Region for agricultural loans. Of this, 60,000 *dashi* of grain and 20 billion Border Region currency are allocated to the North Yue District, and 30,000 *dashi* of grain and 30 billion Border Region currency are allocated to the Ji-Zhong District. In addition, 100,000 *dashi* of grain will be allocated to the Border Region Bank to purchase silver dollars, copper coins, and other floating wealth, so that the floating wealth distributed to the liberated farmers can immediately be transformed into production capital. The grain for loans will be managed by the county government, with the new farmers' associations below the district level responsible for specific planning. Loans will be uniformly managed by the bank, with the bank having direct relationships with the loan management organs in each county. The grain for agricultural loans has now been allocated to each administrative office, and the funds will also be allocated to each branch bank in batches. In the notice regarding agricultural loans, the Finance and Economics Office pointed out that the guiding principle of agricultural loans is to support and help farmers in production. It is necessary to conduct thorough investigations, specifically understand the difficulties of the farmers, and find ways to lend or arrange for whatever the farmers need. It is necessary to prevent repeating the landlord and rich peasant line, prevent misappropriation and other disguised forms of encroachment; at the same time, it is also necessary to prevent nominal relief and charitable viewpoints. After the agricultural loans are issued, it is necessary to ensure that they are recovered within the prescribed period.

    帮助农民发展生产
    晋察冀发放大批农贷
    【新华社晋察冀十三日电】边区财经办事处为帮助农民发展生产，决定全边区拨九万大石粮食、五百亿元边币（每元合蒋币八元左右）办理农贷。计分配北岳区六万大石粮食、二百亿元边币；冀中区三万大石粮食、三百亿元边币。另外，还拨十万大石粮食，由边区银行收买白洋、铜元等浮财。使翻身农民分得之浮财立即变为生产资本。贷粮由县政府经营，由区以下的新农会负责具体计划。贷款统一由银行经营，银行和各县管理贷款机关发生直接关系。农贷的粮食现已拨到各行署，款项也将分批拨到各分行。财办处在关于农贷的通知中指出：农贷的方针在于扶植和帮助农民生产。要进行切实调查，具体了解农民的困难，农民需要什么，就想办法贷出什么或筹办什么，要防止再犯地主富农路线，防止挪用和其他各种变相的侵占；同时也要防止有名无实的救济、恩赐观点。农贷发出后，要保证按规定期间收回。
