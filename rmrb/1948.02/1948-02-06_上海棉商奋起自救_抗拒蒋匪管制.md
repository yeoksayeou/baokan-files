Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to news from magazines in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: Shanghai cotton merchants, in an effort to save themselves, have openly refused the Chiang bandit's "Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee's" deadline to register cotton stocks, and are selling off their stocks themselves, defying the committee's control. On the 7th of this month, Shanghai cotton merchants will hold a gathering to host the press, denouncing the Chiang bandit's national monopoly capital's ambition to monopolize all cotton. The host of the reception stated: The new measures for cotton yarn and cloth management are to seize the last bit of survival space for cotton merchants, and called on all sectors to provide sympathy and assistance. The private cotton merchants present were filled with indignation, and unanimously protested against the Chiang bandit's new rule of stifling the cotton industry. Furthermore, the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Association also held a meeting at the same time to protest against the Chiang bandit authorities' comprehensive control over cotton yarn and cloth. It is reported that in order to further completely monopolize cotton yarn and cloth in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the Chiang bandit authorities formally established the "National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee" on the 2nd of last month (formerly the "Textile Industry Regulation Committee"). From now on, all rights to purchase, transport, and manage all cotton and cloth in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas will be controlled by the committee. All purchases of Chinese cotton, foreign cotton procurement, and cotton allocation and yarn collection will be under the unified control of the committee. Furthermore, all textile factories in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas were ordered to register all spindles, looms, and production quantities before the 10th of last month. Originally, more than 70 percent of the products of private textile factories were forcibly purchased by the Chiang bandit authorities, causing them extreme hardship. Since the establishment of the committee, their business freedom has been completely deprived, and they have been reduced to victims who "spin and weave on behalf" of the four major families.

    上海棉商奋起自救
    抗拒蒋匪管制
    【新华社陕北三日电】据蒋区杂志消息：沪市棉商为自救计，已公开拒绝蒋匪“花纱布管理委员会”的限期登记存棉，不受该委员会的管制而迳自抛售存棉。本月七日沪市各棉商并集会招待新闻界，痛斥蒋匪国家垄断资本垄断全部棉花之野心。招待会主持者称：花纱布管理新办法是夺取棉商最后一点生存余地，呼吁各界予以同情援助。到会各民营棉商情绪激愤，一致抗议蒋匪扼杀棉业之新统治办法。又沪市棉纱业公会亦于同时集会抗议蒋匪当局对花纱布之全面管制。按：蒋匪当局为了进一步完全垄断蒋管区花纱布，已于上月二日正式成立“全国花纱布管理委员会”（按系由过去之“纺织事业调节委员会”改组而成），今后蒋区全部棉花和纱布的购买、运销和经营的权利全操之于该会，所有华棉收购、外棉采办以及配棉收纱等，均由该会统制。并限令蒋区各纺织厂于上月十日前将全部纱锭、布机和生产数量登记完毕。各民营纺织厂产品原来就有百分之七十以上为蒋匪当局强迫收购，困苦万状，自该委员会成立后，其营业自由更被剥夺一光，沦为替四大家族“代纺代织”的牺牲者。
