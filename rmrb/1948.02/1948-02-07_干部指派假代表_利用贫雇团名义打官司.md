Cadres Assign Fake Representatives
Use the Name of Poor Peasant Leagues to File Lawsuits

　　After Guo Wenzhang’s lawsuit reached the Border Region Government, the Nanxijing “Poor Peasant League” held two or three meetings about it. According to poor peasant Guo Jinzhu: “After Wang Wenyi was detained at the Border Region Government, Instructor Yuan from the village hospital came to ask me if Wang Wenyi was a poor peasant. I said he was. Then he told me to bring it up for discussion in the Poor Peasant League. When the Poor Peasant League meeting was held, I brought it up, but everyone remained silent. Shen Zhiming then said: ‘A preemptive strike doesn’t count!’ The meeting didn’t accomplish much. Shen Zhiming just started reading the newspaper.” Later, Anti-Resistance Director Wang Hu said to Director Gao: “Wenyi is our Farmers' Association director, we have to think of a way.” According to Gao Changfu: “We planned to send more than ten people to look for him,” Zhiming said: “No need, send one or two people is enough, go to the Border Region to inquire about where he is?” The people sent, afraid of being questioned, pretended to be going to Zhao Village to collect debts. According to them: “We inquired that he was in ×× village, but when we got to the edge of the village, we didn’t dare to go into the village to ask, so we returned.”

　　When the Border Region Government called for the election of representatives to resolve the marriage dispute between the Guo and Wang families, according to Guo Jinzhu: “Shen Zhiming told Hu Tingxuan to have me, Wang Zhanquan, and Shen Youquan go. Later, at the village office, nothing was said, we were just told to take a list to the Border Region. I heard that this list was discussed and written by Wang Huaijie, Wang Hainiu, Wang Jufu, Wang Hu, Zhang Jiahhou, Hu Qicai, and seven or eight others. It was written and given to our representatives to take. The Poor Peasant League didn’t discuss it, and there was no election. We are illiterate, everyone said to say what was written on the list, each person remember one or two points, say as much as you can, and say whatever you are asked.”

　　According to Wang Zhanquan (a member of the Farmers’ Association Standing Committee), a representative from Nanxijing: “That day, the Poor Peasant League meeting gathered forty or fifty people, and only then were the three of us called to go. Why were we called to go? I said: ‘What can I do with my mouth? What can I do with my literacy?’ Director Gao said: ‘It’s nothing, just go see Wang Wenyi, and say what’s wrong with what’s in the newspaper.’ I thought, everyone was assembled, and only then were the three of us called to go, isn’t this collusion among the cadres!?”

　　From the activities of the fake Poor Peasant League, the reporter talked about the matter of assigning representatives, and Shen Zhiming couldn’t hide it. He had to admit that the representatives were assigned.

　　On the 5th of this month, when the reporter asked Shen Zhiming about the above situation, and with the fact that the "Poor Peasant League" had a considerable number of cadres and upper-middle peasant components, he initially tried to shirk responsibility. Later, he admitted that the Nanxijing “Poor Peasant League” was no different from the old Farmers' Association and was not a true poor peasant organization. He said that the county and district leaders did not ask to organize a poor peasant league now, but that he and Bai Xiucheng, Li Guofang, Guo Wengui, and other district cadres had discussed it. They decided to find one or two genuine poor peasant activists in each base-point village to prevent sabotage of the land law. He also said: Village cadres often exploit peasants' fruits, peasants are generally afraid of cadres, and poor peasants are afraid to raise objections to cadres. He believed that only Gao Changfu and Wang Zhanquan were good, and he was determined to preserve them. He said to Wang Zhanquan: "Work hard, and you will be promoted in the future." He also said to Gao Changfu: "As long as you get close to the masses, your future is bright." (Shen Zhiming became a cadre because Gao Changfu mobilized him.) Therefore, Shen Zhiming regarded them as the backbone of the "Poor Peasant League" and appointed Gao Changfu as the leader. Finally, Shen Zhiming said: Because village cadres and activists, etc., had infiltrated the "Poor Peasant League", the "Poor Peasant League" simply could not exist.

    干部指派假代表
    利用贫雇团名义打官司
    郭文章的官司打到边府以后，南西井“贫雇团”为这事开过两三次会。听贫雇郭金柱谈：“王文义押到边府后，驻村医院袁指导员来问我，王文义是不是贫雇？我说是贫雇。他就叫我在贫雇团提出来讨论讨论。开贫雇会的时候，我提出来，大家都不吭气。申志明就说：‘先凶不算凶！’这个会弄得没啥结果。申志明就念起报来了。”以后抗勤主任王胡找高主任说：“文义是咱们农会主任，也得想个法子。”另据高长富说：“我们准备派十多个人去找”，志明说：“不用，派一两个人去就可以了，去边区打听打听他在哪里？”派的人怕别人问，假装是去赵庄要帐的。根据他们说：“打听着在××村，走到村边，没敢进村打听，就返回来了。”
    边府叫选代表去解决郭王两家婚姻问题，据郭金柱说：“申志明给胡廷选说，叫我和王占全、申有全三个人去，后来到村公所，也没说啥，叫带上一个单单上边区。听说这个单单是王怀节、王海牛、王聚富、王胡、张家后、胡起才等七八个人讨论好的，写好叫咱代表们拿上就去了。贫雇会没有讨论，也没选举，咱不识字，大家说照着单单上写的说，一个人记下一两条，能说多少就说多少，人家问啥就说啥。”
    另据南西井代表王占全（是农会常委）说：“那一天贫雇团开会，四五十个人都集合齐啦，才叫俺们三个去的。俺一去，大家就叫俺三个去边府。为啥叫我去呢？我说：‘凭我的嘴呢？凭我识字呢？’高主任说：‘没有啥，去看看王文义，照着报上那点不对就说说’。我思想，人家都齐啦，才叫俺三个去，这不是干部内串了吧！？”
    记者从假贫雇团的活动，谈到指派代表的事，申志明无法掩盖。只好承认：代表是指派的。
    本月五日，当记者根据上述全部情况，并以“贫雇团”里有了相当多的干部和上中农成份去问申志明时，开头他还想推脱责任，后来承认：南西井“贫雇团”已经和旧农会没有两样了，不是真正贫雇组织。他说：县区领导上并没叫现在组织贫农团，只是他和白秀成、李国芳、郭文贵等几个区干讨论过。决定按基点每村找一两个真的贫雇积极分子，能防止破坏土地法就行。他还说：村干部多占农民果实，农民普遍怕干部，贫雇对干部有意见不敢提。认为只有高长富、王占全好，他决心要把他们保存下来。他对王占全说：“好好干，今后提拔你。”也对高长富说：“只要你好好接近群众，你的前途远大。”（申志明当干部，是高长富动员出来的）因此，申志明把他们当作“贫雇团”中坚分子，并指定高长富当领头。最后，申志明说：因为村干和积极分子等钻进了“贫雇团”，“贫雇团”根本没法存在下去了。
