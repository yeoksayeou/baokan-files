　　Hurry and Deliver Manure
　　Spring has come early this year, so we must prepare for spring plowing as soon as possible. Delivering manure is a major task right now. In Xigou Village, Pingshun, the whole village held a meeting on the second day of the Lunar New Year to explain the principles involved. The next day, middle and poor peasants organized themselves and worked from dawn till dusk to deliver manure with great enthusiasm. We should all learn from them. We must understand the decree and start delivering manure immediately.
　　Some people do not understand the Land Law and mistakenly interpret land redistribution as disruptive equalization. They worry that delivering manure to the fields will be a waste of effort and manure. This idea is wrong. The method of implementing the Land Law in our old liberated areas is to take from the fertile and give to the barren, take more from the rich and give more to the poor, without touching the floating wealth of the middle peasants. Everyone should clearly understand this principle and focus on production.

　　赶快送粪
    今年春浅，要趁早准备春耕，眼下送粪是件大事。平顺西沟村，大年初二全村就开了个会，讲通道理，第二天，中农、贫农就组织起来，起早搭黑把粪送，劲头很大。咱们都要向他们学习。要认清法令，马上动手送粪。
    还有些人，不了解土地法，把平分错会为打乱平分，怕把粪送到地里，误了工，白搭了粪。这种想法不对，在咱们老区实行土地法办法是抽肥补瘦抽多补少，不动中农的浮财，大家应该很好的认清这个道理，安心生产。
