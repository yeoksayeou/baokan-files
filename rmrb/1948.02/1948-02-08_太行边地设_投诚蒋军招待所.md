    Taihang News: The Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee, the Military Sub-district Political Department, and relevant departments recently studied and arranged how to carry out political offensives in the region, and instructed all departments to implement them conscientiously. The instructions pointed out that all localities must, based on their circumstances, penetrate deep into enemy territory, launch political offensives, publicize the Outline Land Law, and disintegrate stubborn bandits and soldiers, as the central task of the border region's struggle at present. This political offensive must be carried out under the unified leadership of the county party committee as the core, organizing all forces that can be organized to carry it out with all their strength. Wherever the troops operate, they should accept the unified leadership of the county party committee. Under unified leadership, they should jointly study, concretely divide the work, compete with each other, and oppose acting independently and shirking responsibility. In particular, troops should penetrate deep into enemy territory to carry out activities, using military actions to cooperate with political offensives, and should not emphasize purely military actions. During the political offensive, all border areas should establish "KMT Army Deserter Reception Centers" at the level of district offices to receive KMT soldiers who have deserted. Deserters should not be treated coldly or insulted, and those who surrender with weapons should be rewarded. (Sun Lin Kui)

    太行边地设“投诚蒋军招待所”
    【太行消息】太行五地委、分区政治部及有关部门，前几天研究布置了该区如何开展政攻的事情，并指示各部确切执行。在指示中指出：各地必须根据情况，深入敌后，开展政治攻势，宣传土地法大纲，瓦解顽匪军，作为目前边地斗争中心任务。这一政治攻势，又必须在以县委为核心的一元化领导下，组织一切可能组织的力量，全力进行，部队活动到那里，即应接受该县县委的统一领导。在一元化领导下，共同研究，具体分工，互相比赛，反对各自为政，互相推委。特别部队应深入敌后活动，以军事行动，配合政攻，不得强调单纯的军事行动。政攻开展中，凡边沿地区应以区公所为单位成立“蒋军逃亡士兵招待所”，以招待逃来之蒋军。对逃来人员不得冷淡、辱侮，携械投诚者还要受到奖励。（孙林魁）
