　　Determined to Remold Ourselves Among the Masses
  　Glimpses of Experience of Comrades from Central Government Cultural Work After Going to the Countryside
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] After rectifying their ranks, a portion of cultural work comrades from the central government cultural departments who went to the countryside have, from their initial contact with the lives of the masses, begun to understand how the masses are educating them. They are also realizing how ignorant they were of the lives of the peasants in the past. A young comrade from the New China News Agency General Branch, who came from a landlord family, was previously a young work comrade who paid attention to neat clothes and loved beauty. In Party life, his class boundaries were consistently blurred, and he was disciplined at the Party rectification meeting. However, he regarded his punishment as the Party's education for him and accepted it happily. This time when he went to the countryside, he exchanged his original clean cotton clothes for the cook's cotton clothes in the office. In the past, he loved to eat and drink well, but this time in the countryside, he lived with a poor single farmer, eating the same cornbread mixed with bean dregs as him, without feeling it was bitter. In his work, he sincerely accepted the masses' suspicion and scrutiny of him. Initially, the poor farmer asked him about his family background, and he told him the truth, also saying that he had made mistakes. Later, the farmers suspected him of working for bad cadres. Once, when he returned from the cooperative, the poor farmer Ying Huiniang asked him, "What did you say to the village cadres? What did the cadres say to you?" At first, he felt a headache over these things, feeling that since he came to serve the farmers and was very sincere, they should not suspect him. But later he thought it through, he realized that he had just begun to betray his class, and accepting the masses' test was entirely necessary. His determination to overcome all difficulties became even greater. He went to visit a poor farmer, who did not like to answer the questions he raised, so he personally went with him to the mountains to chop firewood and do work for him. Finally, this poor farmer voluntarily told him his innermost thoughts.
    A comrade who had worked in local areas during the War of Resistance against Japan and then worked in the newspaper, he had a relatively good understanding of the lives of the masses in the past, but this time in the common life with the poor peasants, because he himself did not have enough to eat, he began to experience that the lives of the poor peasants are often in a state of semi-starvation. In the winter school, his criticisms of some wrong opinions did not work, but when the masses rose up, their criticisms were much more powerful.
    In addition, there are some comrades who are newly arrived from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and some who have stayed in the liberated areas for a period of time, but do not understand the countryside at all. But they do not lose confidence because of this and are very enthusiastic. In terms of life, they used to be afraid of lice, but now they are not afraid. One comrade heard someone say that livestock should also be allocated a share of land for eating fodder, and felt that it made sense, but thought that since the Land Law Outline did not have this provision, it should be clarified. So he asked a middle peasant, who told him that good livestock can still earn grain by cultivating land for others and does not need to be allocated land. They felt very happy to accept such knowledge. Their enthusiasm and confidence in serving the masses are gradually increasing with their new mass life and experience.

### 决心在群众中改造　中直文化工作同志下乡后的点滴体验

　　决心在群众中改造
  　中直文化工作同志下乡后的点滴体验
    【本报消息】经过整顿队伍，中直文化部门下了乡的一部分文化工作同志，从开始接触群众生活中，他们初步体会到群众如何在教育着自己，同时也考虑出自己，过去对农民生活是十分无知的。地主出身的新华总分社一个青年同志，过去他是一个讲究衣服整洁，爱漂亮的青年工作同志，在党的生活中一贯的阶级界限不分，整党会上，曾受到处分。但他对自己的处分认为是党对自己的教育，很愉快的接受了。他这次下乡，用自己原来的干净棉衣，换了机关里伙夫的棉衣。过去他是很爱吃喝的，但这次下乡，同一个光棍贫农住在一起，同他吃一样的渗了豆腐渣的杂面窝窝头，不以为苦。工作中他诚恳的接受了群众对他的怀疑与考查。起初贫农问他家庭成份，他据实告诉了，而且说自己还犯了错误。后来农民又怀疑他给坏干部们办事，有一次，他去了合作社回来，贫农英会娘问他：“你给村干部讲了什么？干部又给你讲了什么？”他起初对这些事情感到头痛，觉得自己既来为农民服务，而且又是心很诚，他们不应怀疑。但后来他想通了，他认识到自己才开始叛变阶级，接受群众的考验，是完全必要的。打破一切困难的决心更大了，他去访问一个贫农，他不爱回答他所提的问题，便亲与他到山上打柴、给他做活，终于这个贫农自动对他说了知心话。
    抗战时期作过地方工作，以后才作报社工作的一个同志，他过去还是比较了解群众生活的，但这次在与贫雇的共同生活中，由于他自己吃不饱饭，才开始体验到贫雇的生活是经常处于半饥饿状态的。在冬学里，自己对一些错误意见批评，没有起了作用，但当群众起来之后，他们的批评就有力得多。
    此外，还有一部分同志是新从蒋区来的，还有的是虽在解放区呆了一个时期，但根本不懂得农村。但他们并不因此而失掉信心，热情很高。从生活上讲，过去还怕过虱子，现在不怕了。一位同志听有人说，牲口吃草料，亦应分一份土地，心里觉得有道理，但觉得既然土地法大纲上没有这规定，就应弄清楚，于是请教了一个中农，他才告诉他，好牲口还能给别人耕地赚粮食，不需要分地。他们对于接受这样的知识，感到十分愉快。他们对于新的群众生活与体验，逐渐增强着他们为群众服务的热情与信心。
