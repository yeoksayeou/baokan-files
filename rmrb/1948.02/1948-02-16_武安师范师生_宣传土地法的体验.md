    Experiences of Teachers and Students of Wu'an Normal School in Publicizing the Land Law

    Editor:
    With the instruction and call of the County Committee, 32 teachers and students of Wu'an Normal School went to the villages on January 25 to publicize the Land Law in coordination with the district cadres. The comrades who publicized in Dongzhaizi Village, Second District, felt the following points in the publicity. I don't know if they are appropriate. Please correct me:

    (1) Do not rely on village cadres, but find poor peasants and hired laborers yourself. Let poor peasants and hired laborers find other poor peasants and hired laborers to spread the word. This way, not only can we find real poor peasants and hired laborers, but they also dare to tell us what they want to say. In Xizhai, we first found old Lian who herds sheep, and then he found Chen Changzi and Lian Lintai, who had been farm laborers all their lives, and then they found more than forty poor peasants and hired laborers. Without the cadres present, they told us everything they had to say. (2) Start with talking about the emancipation (翻身 - turning over), and explain the Land Law based on their actual situation and the village's situation. This is what they love to hear most. They will then know that the Land Law has a close relationship with them. When we asked them if they had turned over thoroughly, Chen Changzi pointed to the thin, tattered cotton coat he was wearing and said, "Don't even mention it, look at this. The rice is almost gone, and we have no way to celebrate the New Year!" Lian Lintai and several poor peasants standing beside him also argued, "Our lives are not as good as the landlords. The cadres of the mutual aid group in the east are working with the landlords, and the share capital is larger than the cooperative, probably two or three million. Others eat well and dress well, but we still eat chaff and bran;" "The village secretary and the person in charge of finance and grain are all targets of struggle. We dare not say a word in front of them;" "In the past, the fruits and trees of the Farmers' Association were all bought with money. We offered 500, and others offered 1,000. Anyway, we poor people can't buy what we want. Most of the good things and good land are taken by those who have connections and the cadres. We only cultivate some slopes and barren land..." We told them: The Land Law Outline is to correct these problems. In the future, no one, whether landlords, cadres, or party members, can be shielded. Those who have not been struggled against, and those who have not been struggled against thoroughly, must be struggled against thoroughly. No matter who it is, cadres or anyone else, those who have taken more fruits must return them, and those who have taken less must be compensated. Land must be divided equally according to population, and the excess must be taken from the rich to compensate the poor... The reason why you didn't turn over thoroughly before is because we were not in charge. The Land Law Outline also stipulates that in the future, our poor peasants and hired laborers will be in charge and unite with the middle peasants to thoroughly turn over... Lian Lintai said, "Chairman Mao sees things clearly and thinks thoroughly. If it is like that in the future, the poor will truly be able to turn over." After talking, they were asked to find poor peasants to hold meetings to discuss the Land Law, and they became the backbone and active speakers in the meeting. (3) When explaining the Land Law, do not recite it word for word, line by line, because the masses say, "It's dizzying and they can't remember it." The "Letter to the Peasants" should be used in conjunction, explaining one question and one thing at a time, with specific examples. Especially in the relationship between organizing poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations, it should be clearly distinguished, and quick clapper songs should be used to arouse everyone's interest and help them understand. At this time, everyone said, "It hits the nail on the head! Read it again." After the explanation, the spirit of the Land Law: thoroughly eliminate feudalism, poor peasants and hired laborers in charge, unite with the middle peasants... should be brought up to make everyone more clear. Finally, everyone is called upon to prevent sabotage, loopholes, and waste of fruit, and to work hard to produce. (4) It is necessary to repeatedly and carefully visit, publicize, and explain to the poor peasants and hired laborers individually to dispel their worries about cadre retaliation and lack of ability. After the meeting, we went to Lian Lintai and Zhilian to ask them how they felt after listening. Lian Lintai said, "The Land Law is really good, but do we dare to stand up and take charge?" We briefly explained the "Letter to Party Members," the border government's proclamation, and the "Regulations on Punishing Sabotage of Land Reform," and gave the actual example of the political director of Shidong being dismissed, telling him that cadres did not dare to retaliate. Zhilian said, "We honest people don't know how to speak and haven't done anything, so we're afraid we won't get the job!" We also told him, "Honest people have honest reasons." If everyone contributes some ideas, they can get things done together. It will be unfamiliar at first, but it will get better later. When we left Lian Lintai's (59 years old this year) house, he held a bowl of bran and said to us with a smile, "Old Li! Tell the higher-ups: Start earlier next year! Send a work team down earlier!" (5) Don't be impatient when discussing the Land Law: When discussing the Land Law, they raise practical problems and personal matters. Some people ask to elect representatives and start working immediately. We tell them that some things can be solved by the district cadres, and some things can be arranged together next year. The main thing is to let everyone understand the Land Law and then use it, so that they won't make mistakes. Tell them, "Only after understanding the Land Law can you manage your home well." (6) Do not relax the publicity to middle peasants and cadres. In addition to individual publicity and opening poor peasant meetings, farmers' associations should also be opened. Some middle peasants are very afraid, and some think that the landlords have been struggled against enough, and they are not called to participate in the poor peasant meetings, fearing that it will be their turn. Some people say that they will support handing over their surplus grain and furniture when discussing the Land Law Outline. When we were eating at Lao Chen's (upper middle peasant) house, he said that his life has not been good recently, and he still has a few more rooms. When I told him that the floating wealth of the upper middle peasants would definitely not be touched, he asked me twice, "Really? Really?" I said yes, and he was relieved. Therefore, in the farmers' association, in addition to general publicity, we must point out why the poor peasants and hired laborers should be in charge, and unite with the middle peasants, emphasizing that we are fighting feudalism, not the middle peasants. The middle peasants have also suffered from feudal oppression and exploitation. The poor peasants and middle peasants are one family. Even the floating wealth of the upper middle peasants will definitely not be touched, and should not be wasted. When it is time to deliver manure, deliver it, and record whose manure is delivered more. The other party will find the money (this is instructed by the County Committee), and no one will suffer; Some cadres also have some doubts, fearing that the Land Law Outline is to struggle against the cadres and dismiss all the cadres. Some are a little depressed, and some are suspiciously trying to win over the poor peasants. Here we focus on the People's Daily short commentary on January 20, "Knowing Mistakes and Correcting Mistakes is the Only Way Out," saying that good cadres will still be supported by the masses, so that everyone can rest assured.

    宣传土地法的体验
    编辑同志：
    武安师范师生三十二人，在县委会指示号召下，于一月二十五日配合区干部到村宣传土地法，在二区东寨子村宣传的同志，在宣传中感觉有一下几点体会，不知是否合适，请指正：
    （一）不依赖村干部，自己去找贫雇，贫雇找贫雇宣传。这样不但能找到真实的贫雇，他们也敢向我们谈出心里要说的话。在西寨我们首先找到放羊的老连，由他就找到做了一辈子长工的陈昌子和连林太，再由他们就找到了四十几个贫雇。没有干部在，他们有啥话，都给我们讲。（二）先从翻身谈起，根据他们和村上的实际情况来解释土地法。这样他们最爱听。知道土地法和他们有切身的关系。当我们问他们翻身翻得透不？陈昌子指着身上穿的那件单薄破棉衣说：“不用提了，你看就是这，现在米快光了，过年还没法！”连林太和站在侧边的几个贫雇也就争着说开了：“咱时光还没老财过的好，东头互助组干部和老财伙着干，股本比合作社还要大，怕有二三百万，别人吃好穿好，咱还吃糠ｇǔ＠①蚀”；“村上书记和财粮都是斗争对象，咱哪敢在他们面前吭一声”，“过去农会果实地、树子，都是使钱买，咱出五百，别人出一千，反正心想要的东西咱穷人买不着，好东西好地大部都被有法的和干部分去了，咱都是种些坡子赖地……”我们就给他们说：土地法大纲就是来改正这些毛病的。以后不管啥老财、干部、党员谁也不能包庇，没有斗和没有斗彻底的，都要斗彻底，不论何人，干部也好，多拿了果实的要退出，少的要填补，土地要按人口均分，抽多补少抽肥补瘦……以前没有翻透身，就是因为咱没有当家，土地法大纲上也规定好了，以后要由咱贫雇来当家，团结中农彻底翻透身。……连林太说：“毛主席就是见得清，想得周到，以后那样，穷人就真正能翻身了”。谈完后再由他们找贫雇开会来谈土地法，他们就成了当中的骨干分子和积极发言人了。（三）在讲土地法时，不要一字一条的死念，那样群众说：“昏昏的记不着”；要把告农民书配合起来，一个问题，一件事来讲，要具体多举例，尤其在组织贫农团和农会关系这一点上要分清，还要用快板唱歌来提起大家的兴趣，帮助他们了解。这时大家都说：“正碰心事！再念一遍”。讲完后再把土地法的精神：彻底消灭封建，贫雇当家，团结中农……提出来，让大家更明确起来。最后叫大家起来防止破坏、钻空子、浪费倒果实，努力生产。（四）要反复细心深入贫雇个别访问宣传解释，解除怕干部报复和能力不够的顾虑。在会后我们又去找了连林太、志连他们，问他们听了后感觉怎样，连林太说：“土地法就是不赖，咱敢不敢起来当家？”咱把告党员书、边府布告、破坏土地改革治罪条例简单的说了说，还举石洞政治主任被撤职的实际例子讲给他听，告诉他干部不敢报复，志连说：“咱老实人不会讲话，没有办过事，怕不着！”咱又告诉他“老实人有个老实理”一人出点主意，配起来就能办事了，开初不熟以后就好了。当我们离开连林太（今年五十九）他家的时候，他端着一碗糠＠蚀连搅带笑的给我们说“老李！给上面说：明年早点开始！早点派个工作员下来！”（五）在谈土地法时不要性急：讨论土地法时他们提实际问题和个人事情，有的要求马上选代表马上就干，咱告诉他有些事可找区干部解决，有些事明年一起按排好了才做的好。主要是让大家了解土地法，然后运用，才不会作错，告诉他们“了解了土地法以后才能把家管好。（六）不要放松对中农和干部的宣传。除了个别宣传开了贫雇会，还要开农会。中农有些非常害怕，有些认为老财斗的差不多，开贫雇会又不叫咱参加，怕是轮在咱头上来了，有的在谈到土地法大纲时，说把自己多的粮食家具都拥护出来。当我们在老陈（上中农）家吃饭时，他就说，咱近来时光也不好，房子还多有几间，当我给他讲上中农浮财是肯定不动，他听了后连问我两次真的？真的？我说是，他才放心了，所以在农会上除一般宣传外，还要指出为啥要贫雇当家？团结中农，强调咱是斗封建，不是斗中农，中农也受过封建的压迫剥削，贫雇中农是一家，就是上中农浮财，也肯定不动，不要浪费，到了送粪的时候就送，土地平分后，谁的粪送的多记下帐，由对方找钱（这是县委会指示的），谁也不吃亏；有一部分干部也有些怀疑，怕土地法大纲就是斗干部，把所有的干部撤了，有的有些苦闷，有的疑神疑鬼去拉拢贫雇，这里我们着重讲一月二十人民日报短评“知错改错才是出路”，说好干部还会得到群众的拥护，使大家安心。（永光）
