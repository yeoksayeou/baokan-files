　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd. The emancipated peasants of Dabajiazi Village, Xinjin County, Liaonan, especially entrusted our Liaonan branch on Lunar New Year's Eve to send a telegram to Chairman Mao to pay their respects. The original telegram stated: "Respected Chairman Mao, this year we are joyfully, peacefully, and securely celebrating the year of emancipation, the year of liberation, the year of freedom, and the year of happiness. We remember that last year during the New Year, the Kuomintang were still here. On New Year's Eve, we dared not stay at home; the entire village was suffering. This year in April, our People's Liberation Army drove away the Kuomintang. In May, the work team led us to emancipate ourselves, and we were distributed land, livestock, grain, and farm tools. This year, during the New Year, our men, women, young, and old have all put on new clothes, the village has slaughtered pigs, and every household is making tofu. When we pick up our bowls, we think of you; you are the dearest person to us in the world. A few days ago, we saw the merit reports of the young people from our village who had performed meritorious service sent from the front, and the whole village felt honored. We want to defend our emancipation; we must overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and liberate all the poor people in the country. As long as the front needs it, we can enlist at any time. We know that you are concerned about our production. Although we were only emancipated last year, and we haven't spread enough fertilizer, there is no problem. We guarantee that the fields will be fully fertilized in the spring. This year will definitely be a year of bumper harvests. We wish you good health. Farmers of Dabajiazi Village, Xinjin County."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd. Belated news: On the 4th of this month, the Liaonan armed work team, in coordination with a certain unit, captured Zhuangtai, 25 miles north of Yingkou, capturing twenty-one Chiang bandits, including Zhong Yu, lieutenant adjutant of the KMT Temporary 58th Division, and confiscating eighteen long and short guns.

    【新华社东北二十二日电】辽南新金县大八家子村翻身农民，于旧历除夕特嘱本社辽南支社转电给毛主席致敬，原电称：“敬爱的毛主席，我们今年痛痛快快，安安稳稳地过着翻身年，解放年，自由年，快活年。记得去年过年国民党还在这里，大年三十我们不敢在家，那时全村都过的是遭罪年。今年四月天，我们解放军把国民党打跑。五月，工作团领导我们翻身，分得了土地、牲口、粮食、农具。今年过年我们男女老少都换上了新衣裳，村里杀了猪，家家户户都做豆腐。我们端起碗就想起你，你是天底下我们最亲爱的人。前几天看到从前方送来的本村青年立功报功单，我们全村都觉得光彩。我们要保卫翻身，一定要打倒蒋介石，让全国的穷人都翻身。只要前方需要，我们可以随时入伍。我们知道你惦念我们的生产，虽然去年才翻身，粪土泼的还不够多，但没有问题，开春保准地里都上满粪。今年一定五谷丰登。祝你健康。新金县大八家子村农民。”
