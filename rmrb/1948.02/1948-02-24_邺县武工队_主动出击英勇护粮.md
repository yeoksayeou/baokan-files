【Taihang News:】 Last month, in the area where the enemy and we met, the Ye County guerrilla unit and the militia closely combined with the masses to actively launch a struggle against looting, thwarting several incursions by the Chiang Kai-shek diehards, puppet troops, and bandits. On the 26th, more than 100 people from the diehard bandit Cheng Daozeng's unit and the puppet Baibi Township Office went to the Jiacun area to loot grain. Upon receiving the information, the Dazhai joint defense militia of our Fifth District and the guerrilla unit group of the Fourth District immediately launched a counterattack against the enemy, immediately occupying Niujiaying, and then rushing towards Jiacun, repelling the puppet bandits and wounding five enemies. On the same day, our Third District guerrilla unit was active in Liucun when the enemy sent a farmer from the XX village to investigate our situation. Unwilling to serve the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and harm his own people, he reported the enemy's situation to us, stating that the diehard bandits were conscripting soldiers and looting grain in the village. We immediately took the opportunity to rush up, causing the enemy to flee westward, liberating nine young people who had been seized by the enemy in Sizhuang. On the 27th, the diehard bandit Cheng Daozeng and Wang Ziquan's units, combined with a company from Chiang's 40th Division, totaling more than 300 people, launched a two-pronged attack to loot grain. The militia of our Fifth District, in coordination with a unit of our troops, drove the enemy all the way to Xiaobeiguan. When they reached the west of Gangshang Village, they were again swept by machine guns and rifles by the Dazhai joint defense militia active in Jiacun, immediately killing six enemies and wounding five. On the same day, our Third District guerrilla unit divided into three groups and were active in Suntaoji, Doufuying, and Lianzhuang, discovering that more than 30 enemy plainclothes were looting grain and conscripting soldiers in Gaojia Village, and even using machine guns to strafe the masses fleeing east. Our guerrilla unit immediately surrounded the enemy in the village, launching a three-pronged attack, killing and wounding three enemies, and annihilating the fleeing enemy in a panic to the west. They fled to Changxiang Village, thinking they had escaped to a safe zone and were safe and sound, and were preparing to rest, eat, and demand money when the guerrilla unit active in Lianzhuang received information from the masses and immediately rushed over, wounding one enemy, and the rest fled in a hurry. They fled to Dongliyuan and were looting grain and demanding money when our guerrilla unit also chased after them, defeating the enemy again. The masses in the village all came out to welcome our guerrilla unit, and complained, "The enemy demands 150,000 yuan per mu, and if you can't pay, you can't get by. You've driven away the starving ghosts!" On the 28th, the militia of the Chengdou, Dazhai, and Zungui joint defenses of the Fifth District heroically repelled the incursions of Chiang's 40th Division and the puppet Wang Ziquan's units, totaling two to three hundred people, who were looting grain, chasing them all the way to Xiaobeiguan.
