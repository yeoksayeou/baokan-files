Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. According to reports from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the people in both urban and rural Guangxi are impoverished under Chiang Kai-shek's oppression. In Guilin, the provincial capital, prices continue to soar. In the past year, the price of white rice rose from 27,500 Chiang Kai-shek currency per dan to 380,000, an increase of nearly 14 times. "Chick" brand poplin rose from 190,000 to 3.5 million per bolt, an increase of more than 18 times. Salt even rose 23 times. As prices soared, the actual income of citizens decreased daily. According to the Chiang Kai-shek central government's standards, the purchasing power of provincial civil servants' salaries in January last year was 22% of the pre-war level (June 1937), 14% in August, and about 9% in December. The tax burden on citizens is extremely heavy. Last year alone, the "emergency security fee" in the seven cities of Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning, Guixian, Yulin, and Baise reached 24 billion yuan. The situation in rural areas is even more desolate. The province's average annual grain output is more than 510 million dan, which is still 50 million dan short of the province's consumption. The output in 1945 was sharply reduced to only 250 million dan. In the following two years, there were successive disasters. In 1946, more than 3 million farmers suffered from disasters, and in 1947, more than 1 million. However, Chiang Kai-shek's conscription of military grain has not relaxed at all. In 1946, 3 million dan were forcibly requisitioned, and another 2.5 million dan were requisitioned in 1947. The concentration of land is also alarming. Chiang Kai-shek's high-ranking officials and dignitaries are the most aggressive in annexation. In Longsheng County in northeastern Guangxi, all the land in the county is concentrated in the hands of a few large landlords, and tenant farmers account for 70% of the rural population. In Xing'an County, with a population of 140,000, nearly 90,000 are tenant farmers. In Rong County, southeastern Guangxi, the hometown of Chiang Kai-shek's Guangxi Province Chairman Huang Xuchu, bureaucrats and large landlords own land with rents of 10,000 to 20,000 dan. Rural interest rates are mostly in kind. When farmers in Xing'an borrow one dan of grain from landlords during the lean season, they have to pay five to eight dou of interest when the autumn harvest comes. During the disasters of the past two years, landlords took advantage of the situation even more. In the Pingle area, borrowing one dan required returning two to three dan, and in Yangshuo and Quan counties, it was as high as five dan. Farmers were even forced to sell their children. A folk song popular in the Pingnan area says: "Selling children is a common thing, thinking carefully, it is cannibalism. Afraid to hear mother crying when I return, a ten-year-old child for a dou of millet." In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's frantic conscription of soldiers has led to popular uprisings in Guangxi in recent years. Chiang Kai-shek's officials also admit that the areas of popular uprisings cover the rural areas of 120 townships in 22 counties.

　　广西民变遍二十二县
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋匪压榨下的广西城乡人民均穷困不堪。该省省会桂林市物价不断飞涨，去年一年中白米每担由蒋币二万七千五，涨到三十八万，上升近十四倍；雏鸡牌士林布每匹由十九万涨到三百五十万，上升十八倍以上；食盐更上涨到二十三倍；房租一般涨了二十倍。在物价高涨下市民的实际所得日益降低，省级公务员薪津的购买力，按蒋匪中央的标准，去年一月份为战前（一九三七年六月）百分之二十二，八月份为百分之十四，十二月份则约为百分之九。市民的捐税负担则极苛重，桂林、柳州、梧州、南宁、贵县、郁林、百色七个城市去年仅“紧急保安费”一项，即达二百四十亿元。农村现状尤为凋敝：该省粮食常年产量为五亿一千余市担，较全省消费量尚差五千万市担，一九四五年产量复锐减，仅二亿五千万市担；此后两年又连遭灾荒，四六年遭灾农民达三百余万，四七年亦一百余万，而蒋匪勒索军粮毫不放松，四六年强征三百万市担，四七年又征二百五十万市担。土地集中亦甚惊人：蒋匪之达官显要兼并最烈，桂东北龙胜县全县土地集中于几家大地主，佃农达农村人口百分之七十；兴安全县人口十四万，佃农将近九万人。蒋匪桂省主席黄旭初的家乡桂东南容县，官僚兼大地主者均拥地租一万至二万担。农村利息多为实物，兴安农民在青黄不接时向地主借谷一担，转眼秋收，即须付息五斗到八斗，在前两年的灾荒中，地主更趁火打劫，平乐一带借一担还两担到三担，阳朔及全县更高达五担。农民甚至被迫卖儿鬻女，平南一带流行民谣说：“卖儿本事寻常事，仔细思量人吃人，回来怕听阿娘哭，十岁婴孩一斗粟”。加以蒋匪疯狂抓丁，故年来桂省民变蜂起，蒋匪官方亦承认：民变地区遍及二十二县一百二十乡镇的农村。
