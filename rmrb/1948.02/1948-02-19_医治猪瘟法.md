    Method for Treating Swine Fever
    Recently, swine fever has been prevalent, causing great losses to the masses. Past methods introduced in newspapers have proven ineffective. Recently, our farm obtained a method from the Changrui Cooperative, which has been successfully tested and has cured many cases in the Wangjiagou area of our county. People often come to ask about it, so we are introducing it here for use in various places:
    Atractylodes lancea one tael, fritillaria thunbergii three taels, sea salt four mace. Grind into a powder, sprinkle it into thin porridge and feed it to the pigs; they will recover in three days.

    医治猪瘟法
    最近猪瘟流行，群众损失很大。试用过去报上介绍的方法，都不生效。最近本场从常瑞合作社得一法，试验成功，在本县王家沟一带治好很多，群众经常来问，特此介绍，供各地采用：
    苍术一两，川贝母三两，海盐四钱。研成末，撒在稀饭内喂，三日即愈。
