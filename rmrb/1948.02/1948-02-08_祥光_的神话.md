The Myth of "Auspicious Light"

In our examination of newspaper "fillers," we have already discovered instances of writing about living people as dead, and also of writing about dead people as alive. This shameful fabrication is not limited to the border region; it exists elsewhere as well.

Recently, I came across a booklet published by Shandong Bookstore, containing an article written by someone under the pseudonym "Auspicious Light." The article claimed that Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the CCP Central Committee, wrote a letter to his family, urging them to hand over their land to the masses, stating that this was "the trend of the times." It further stated that Comrade Kang Sheng had a younger brother who went back to persuade Kang Sheng's father to hand over the land to the masses, but Kang Sheng's father, with "a twirl of his moustache," scolded him roundly. Later, Kang Sheng's younger brother organized the masses for a reckoning, and only then was the land distributed to the masses. This article has been reprinted in magazines and newspapers published in various parts of our border region.

This news was written with great "specificity," but unfortunately, it is a complete fabrication out of thin air. According to those familiar with Comrade Kang Sheng's situation, Comrade Kang Sheng has not had any contact with his family for over twenty years. Kang Sheng's father has also been dead for over twenty years, and his mother has been dead for forty years. He also does not have a younger brother. However, this "Auspicious Light" of a "filler" illuminates the dead back to life, and even sees his "twirled moustache." It even creates a younger brother for Comrade Kang Sheng. More shamefully, it fabricates a letter from Comrade Kang Sheng. A comrade from northern Shaanxi was very surprised when he saw this news. Once "filler" comes to China, it shows even more of its "creative genius," not only telling lies, but also creating myths.

Within our news ranks, "filler" has reached the point of outright fabrication. "Filler" must be thoroughly purged! At the same time, our comrades who edit magazines or newspapers in various parts of the border region should also be cautious when reprinting or selecting articles or news, and should not give "filler" an expanded market.

### “祥光”的神话

    “祥光”的神话
    明
    在我们检查报纸的“客里空”中，已经发现有把活人写成死人的事情，也有把死人写成活人的。这种可耻的捏造，不仅边区有，别处也有。
    最近见到一本小册子，山东书店出版的，里边有一个署名祥光的写的一篇文章，说是中共中央委员康生同志，给他的家里写了一封信，叫家里把地交给群众，说这是“潮流之所趋。”又说康生同志有个弟弟，回去劝康生同志的父亲把地交给群众，康生同志的父亲“两撇胡子一跷”，把他骂了一通，以后康生同志的弟弟组织群众清算，才把地分给群众。这篇文章，咱们边区各地出版的杂志和报纸也有转载了的。
    这个消息写得很“具体”，可惜完全是无中生有的捏造。据熟悉康生同志的情况的说，康生同志已经二十几年没有与家庭发生过关系，康生同志的父亲也死了二十多年，母亲已死了四十年了，也没有一个弟弟。但是这位“客里空”的“祥光”一照，就将死人照活了，而且还看见他的“两撇胡子”。还替康生同志多出一个弟弟，更可耻的，还给康生同志编造了一封信。那个从陕北来的同志看到这个消息时，非常奇怪。“客里空”一到中国来，就更显出他的“创造天才”，不仅会说诳话，而且会编神话。
    在我们新闻队伍里，“客里空”已经到了这种彻头彻尾捏造的程度，“客里空”实在应该彻底肃清了！同时，我们边区各地的杂志或报纸编辑同志，在转载或选录文章或消息的时候，也应该谨慎从事，不要给“客里空”扩大了市场才是。
