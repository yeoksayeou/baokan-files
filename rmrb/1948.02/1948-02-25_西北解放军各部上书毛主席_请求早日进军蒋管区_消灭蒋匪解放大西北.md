Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: After more than two months of the "Three Check-Ups" and military training, the Northwest People's Liberation Army has universally raised its class consciousness and boosted morale. They have successively petitioned Chairman Mao and Deputy Commander Peng, requesting an early order to advance into the KMT-controlled areas to liberate the people of the Great Northwest. A directly subordinate unit recently held a mobilization rally for advancing into the KMT-controlled areas. All commanders and fighters enthusiastically reported their plans for earning merit and held a solemn oath-taking ceremony. A certain squad of another unit, at the unit's "Speak Bitterness, Seek Revenge, Volunteer to Kill the Enemy" meeting, read aloud the entire squad's resolution, led by the squad leader and deputy squad leader:

　　"We are all determined to eradicate selfish desires. We will shed blood and sacrifice for the people, unite to make revolution.

　　We request the superiors to issue orders, the sooner the departure, the better. We wholeheartedly advance to kill Chiang's bandits, so the poor in the Chiang area can stand up."

　　The Eighth Company of a certain unit wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "In our company, twenty people have begged for food in the past, eleven families have starved to death, twenty-six have fled from disaster, nine have been forced to sell their children, seven mothers have remarried due to poverty, and thirty-one have been captured by Chiang's bandits to serve as soldiers. Today, after the "Three Check-Ups" and military training, everyone unanimously demands to fight out, avenge ourselves, and liberate the compatriots in the KMT-controlled areas. Beloved Chairman Mao, please issue the order quickly! We will definitely complete the task resolutely." On the eighth of this month, all the commanders and fighters of the Fourth Company of another unit held a public memorial meeting to commemorate the family members of the soldiers who were persecuted by Chiang's bandits and landlords, and the martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause. The memorial altar was adorned with simple and powerful elegiac couplets: "Rest in peace, comrades who sacrificed themselves for the poor to stand up! We will resolutely inherit your legacy and will not rest until we eliminate the Chiang bandits." "Grievances have their source, debts have their debtor, rest assured, parents who died under oppression! We have already taken up arms, and we will not rest until we avenge our grievances." The soldiers painfully denounced the darkness of Chiang's bandit rule in their writings and indignantly swore before the altar to avenge the dead, demanding that their superiors quickly issue orders to fight into the KMT-controlled areas, eliminate the traitorous Chiang Hu, and liberate the people who have not yet stood up. During the advance discussions in various units, the soldiers earnestly proposed that discipline and unity should be strengthened when fighting in the KMT-controlled areas. The Twelfth Company of a certain unit mentioned in a letter to Chairman Mao about the seven major guarantees to be implemented after going out, especially emphasizing the resolute protection of industry, commerce, and public buildings in the new areas.

　　西北解放军各部上书毛主席
    请求早日进军蒋管区  消灭蒋匪解放大西北
    【新华社西北二十三日电】西北人民解放军经过两个多月的三查和练兵后，阶级觉悟普遍提高，士气高涨，纷纷上书毛主席和彭副总司令，请求早日下令向蒋管区进军，解放大西北人民。某部直属队日前召开进军蒋管区的誓师大会，全体指战员兴奋热烈的报告各人立功计划，并举行严肃的宣誓。另部某班在该部诉苦复仇请缨杀敌大会上，由正副班长率领宣读全班决心书：
    “我们人人下决心，自己私利都去尽。流血牺牲为百姓，团结起来闹革命。
    要求上级下命令，出发最好在最近。一心上前杀蒋匪，蒋区穷人好翻身”。
    某部八连在给毛主席的信上写着：“我们连里过去有二十人讨过饭吃，家里饿死人的有十一个，逃过难的有二十六个，逼卖儿女的有九个，为穷苦所迫母亲改嫁的有七个，被蒋匪抓去当兵的有三十一个，今天我们经过三查和练兵后，大家都一致要求打出去，替自己报仇，解放蒋管区的同胞。敬爱的毛主席，请你赶快下命令吧！我们一定坚决完成任务”。另部四连全体指战员本月八日举行公祭大会，公祭被蒋匪及地主迫害的战士家属和为革命事业忠勇牺牲的烈士们，灵台上贴着简朴有力的挽联：“为穷人闹翻身牺牲的同志们安息吧！我们坚决继承你们遗志，不消灭蒋贼心不死。”“冤有主债有头，屈磨死的爹娘们放心吧！枪杆子咱们已经拿到手，不报冤仇誓不休”。战士们在书上沉痛的控诉了蒋匪统治的黑暗，并在灵前激愤的宣誓为死者伸冤报仇，要求上级赶快下命令打到蒋管区去，消灭蒋胡卖国贼，早日解放尚未翻身的人民。各部队在进军的讨论中，战士们认真的提出到蒋管区作战应加强纪律和团结。某部十二连给毛主席的信中提到出去的七大保证中，特别说明坚决保护新区的工商业和公共建筑物。
