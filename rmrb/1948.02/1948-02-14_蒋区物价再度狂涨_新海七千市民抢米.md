    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Reports from various sources indicate that the price surge in the Chiang-controlled areas during the old Lunar New Year began on the 2nd. By the 5th, the price of rice had risen to 1.66 million yuan per shi dan (unit of dry measure), and to 1.8 million yuan on the 6th. The costs of electricity, water, telephone, and gas have also increased by 20 to 30 percent. Chiang Kai-shek's China and Central Aviation Companies have announced that, starting from the 7th, ticket prices on all routes will increase by 30 to 40 percent. According to financial circles in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek's massive issuance of 5,000-denomination Customs Gold Unit notes (equivalent to 100,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency) during the Lunar New Year is one of the reasons for this price surge. It is estimated that more economic unrest will occur in the next half month. This is the second price surge in the Chiang-controlled areas this year, following the surge at the beginning of the Gregorian calendar year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. East China News: Citizens of Xinpu and Haizhou at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway under Chiang Kai-shek's rule have launched a massive rice riot. From December 13th to 21st of last year, eight rice riots occurred in nine days, involving 7,000 starving people. This anti-hunger struggle is caused by Chiang Kai-shek's oppressive rule. Last year, the city had as many as 32 kinds of taxes and levies, and countless other unnamed exactions, which have impoverished the people.

    新海七千市民抢米
    【新华社陕北八日电】据各方报导：蒋区旧历年关物价涨风已自二日开始。到了五日，米价每市担涨至一百六十六万元，六日一百八十万元，电灯、自来水、电话、和煤气等费用亦均上涨百分之二十至三十。蒋匪中国及中央两航空公司已宣布自七日起各线票价上涨百分之三十至四十。据上海金融界称：蒋匪年关大量发行五千票面关金券（十万蒋币），为此次涨风原因之一；并估计，今后半月即将发生更多经济上的骚动。按此系本年阳历年初涨风后，蒋区之第二次涨风。
    【新华社陕北八日电】华东讯：蒋匪统治下的陇海路东端新（浦）海（州）市民，掀起巨大的抢米骚动。去年十二月十三日至二十一日九天中，发生抢米风潮八次，参加饥民达七千人。此一反饥饿斗争系蒋匪的苛暴统治所造成，该市去年的苛捐杂税，有名目的即达三十二种，无名摊派更不知凡几，致使人民倾家荡产。
