Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd: Qingdao Chiang Kai-shek bandit newspapers reveal that under the devastation of Chiang Kai-shek bandits, four to five thousand Yantai citizens have been reduced to beggars, begging along the streets. Chiang Kai-shek bandits are extorting labor and materials for building city defense works, with each household being forced to pay 400,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency each month. In December before the New Year, Chiang Kai-shek bandits organized "Self-Defense Forces," with the people bearing expenses of over 1 billion; the six Chiang Kai-shek district public offices, in addition to having staff, each have 20-30 district guards, with their salaries all apportioned to the citizens; moreover, various miscellaneous names are numerous, and the marrow-sucking exploitation has made citizens feel universally unable to survive. Cases of selling children, selling daughters, freezing and starving to death are constantly occurring. This forms a strong contrast with the era of democratic government, when citizens lived a life of warmth, fullness, and happiness.

    烟台人民横遭蒋匪蹂躏
    四五千人沦为乞丐
    【新华社华东三日电】青岛蒋匪报纸透露：蒋匪蹂躏下，烟台市民已有四、五千人沦为乞丐，沿街讨饭。蒋匪修筑城防工事摊工摊料，每户每月即被勒索蒋币四十万元。年前十二月间，蒋匪组织“自卫队”，人民负担经费达十余亿元；六个蒋匪区公所，每所除拥有职员外，多拥有区丁二三十人，薪饷均向市民摊派；此外，各种苟杂名目繁多，敲骨吮髓的榨取，已使市民普遍感到活不下去。卖儿鬻女、冻饿而死的事，不断发生。与民主政府统治时代，市民过着温饱、幸福生活，形成强烈对比。
