    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: According to a special dispatch from Shanghai in the pro-Chiang Tianjin Yishibao, prices in Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, rose more than 142,000 times compared to pre-war levels at the end of last year. This is higher than any country after World War II. Food prices rose 110,000 times, textiles 170,000 times, metals 175,000 times, building materials 180,000 times, chemicals and cosmetics 185,000 times, fuel 100,000 times, and imported goods an average of 145,000 times. However, the production index stipulated by the Chiang bandit officials is very low. In December, the index for Shanghai workers was 68,200 times and for staff members only 58,600 times, both less than half of the actual price index.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to Tianjin newspapers, prices in Tianjin, the economic center of Chiang Kai-shek controlled North China, have soared. On the 2nd of this month, grain prices in Tianjin rose more than double compared to the beginning of December last year (before the issuance of the large denomination currency). Rice rose from 8,100 Chiang currency per jin to 19,500 yuan. Millet rose from 5,600 yuan to 12,000 yuan, and corn flour also rose. In the past year, Tianjin's prices rose 13 times, showing an accelerating upward trend compared to the fivefold increase in 1946. There were four periods of particularly sharp increases last year, namely the gold rush in February, the soaring grain prices in April and May, the Mid-Autumn Festival price surge in October, and the surge caused by the issuance of large denomination currency by the Chiang bandits in December. Each price fluctuation resulted in an increase of 40 to 50 percent compared to the previous month.

    较战前涨十四万倍
    【新华社陕北一日电】据亲蒋之天津益世报上海专电披露：蒋区经济中心上海去年年底物价较抗战前一日升高十四万二千倍以上。高过第二次世界大战后任何一国。计食物涨十一万倍，纺织品十七万倍，金属十七万五千倍，建筑材料十八万倍，化学品、化妆品十八万五千倍，燃料十万倍，洋货平均十四万五千倍。而蒋匪官方规定之生产指数则甚低，十二月份上海工人为六万八千二百倍，职员仅五万八千六百倍，皆不及实际物价指数之半。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据天津报纸透露：蒋区华北经济中心天津市物价猛涨。本月二日，津市粮价较之去年十二月初（大钞发行前）上升一倍以上。大米由每斤蒋币八千一百元涨到一万九千五百元。小米由五千六百元涨到一万二千元，玉米面粉亦涨。去年一年中津市物价上涨十三倍，较一九四六年一年之上涨五倍，呈现加速度的涨势。去年上涨最烈者有四个时期，即二月间的金潮，四、五月的粮价狂升，十月间的秋节涨风，十二月间由于蒋匪大钞发行所引起的暴涨，每次物价波动的结果，均较其上月增加百分之四十到五十。
