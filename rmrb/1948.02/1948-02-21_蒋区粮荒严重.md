　　Chiang Area Faces Severe Grain Shortage
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—A Shanghai magazine reveals that the Chiang-controlled areas are facing a severe grain shortage due to a sharp decline in grain production last year. The magazine states that last year's rice harvest in the Chiang-controlled areas was only 67% of the normal yield, estimated at 48.3 million metric tons (i.e., 96.6 million *shi dan*), a shortfall of 3 million metric tons compared to the required amount (i.e., 60 million *shi dan*, equivalent to approximately 37.8 million *shi dan* of white rice). The wheat harvest was even lower, accounting for 60% of the normal yield. The magazine says that if the insufficient grain were to be purchased from foreign countries, each million metric tons of white rice would require $200 million in foreign exchange, which is clearly impossible to raise. It also stated that the "terrifying" grain shortage before this year's autumn harvest "is really unimaginable and unbearable to imagine." The magazine implies that this kind of disaster is caused by Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt and evil rule, saying: The import of white rice in the 10th year of the Republic of China was only 10 million *dan*, while after the 15th year of the Republic of China, the annual import of white rice was frequently over 20 million *dan*. It also said that the reasons for the sharp decline in grain production are that Chiang Kai-shek regularly maintains millions of regular troops, resulting in a shortage of rural labor; Chiang Kai-shek insists on the feudal system of tenancy exploitation and heavy taxes, which shackles productivity and forces farmers to leave the land. At the same time, it is also the inevitable product of (American) imperialist economic aggression and the destruction of the countryside.

　　蒋区粮荒严重
    【新华社陕北十九日电】上海某杂志披露：由于去年粮产锐减，蒋区正面临严重粮荒。该杂志称：去年蒋区稻谷收成仅为常年产量的百分之六十七，估计为四千八百三十万公吨（即九万六千六百万市担），较需要量相差三百万公吨（即六千万市担，约合白米三千七百八十万市担）。小麦收成尤少，计为常年产量的百分之六十。该杂志说：此项不敷之粮食若向外国购买，则每百万公吨白米需外汇两亿美元，显然无法筹措。并称：今年秋收以前的“可怕”粮荒，“实在是不敢想象，不忍想象”。该杂志暗示：此类灾祸，系由蒋匪的腐恶统治所造成，它说：民国十年白米的输入仅一千万担，而民国十五年以后白米进口每年经常在两千万担以上。并说：粮产锐减的原因为蒋匪经常保持数百万常备军，造成农村劳力缺乏；蒋匪坚持封建的租佃剥削制度及重重捐税，束缚了生产力，迫使农民纷纷脱离土地。同时，也是（美）帝国主义经济侵略，摧毁农村的必然产物。
