    Certain Cadres Attempt to Seize Leadership Through Equal Distribution
    Xijing Organizes Fake Poor Peasant Leagues
    Struggles Against Poor Peasants Foster Waste and Undermine the Land Law

    [This newspaper's news] This newspaper's joint reporter group with Xin Dazhong, after a seven-day investigation (January 30th to February 5th), discovered that the "Poor Peasant League" in Nanxijing, Sixth District of Wu'an, was an organization manipulated by certain district and village cadres attempting to seize the leadership of the poor peasants in the land redistribution movement.

    After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the district convened some cadres and masses from various villages to a meeting to explain the Land Law Outline, but there was no instruction to immediately organize poor peasant leagues. Unexpectedly, the district public security cadre Shen Zhiming (a native of Nanxijing, who served as the village chief for several years and is now leading the work at this key point), on the way back to Nanxijing from the district, said to Gao Changfu, the deputy director of the village peasant association: "I'll just tell you, we must organize a poor peasant league, and you can be the head of the poor peasant league." Even before the district explained the Land Law, Shen Zhiming had said in the Nanxijing peasant association: It is necessary to implement the poor peasant line and draw a clear class boundary. He said: "Who are the poor peasants? Gao Changfu is, both poor and a farmhand; Who are the landlords? Hu Tingxuan (political director) is a bankrupt landlord." He said to Gao Changfu: "Once the land redistribution movement comes, many old cadres will fall. The old ones are gone, and the new ones cannot rise; only you and Wang Zhanquan are capable." According to him, his intention was to "preserve" the two cadres, Gao Changfu and Wang Zhanquan. Therefore, upon returning to the village from the district, he actively carried out the activities of organizing the poor peasant league. According to Gao Changfu: "Zhiming said that our poor peasants will rise to be the masters of the house in the future, and the cadres cannot be the masters of the house. We must be prepared, and as soon as official business comes, we will arrange it." Sure enough, at the beginning of the twelfth lunar month, the "Poor Peasant League" of Nanxijing was announced.

    What conditions are required to participate in the poor peasant league? Gao Changfu said: Those who protect landlords are not allowed, hooligans are not allowed, selfish people are not allowed, and those who leak information are not allowed, only honest peasants are allowed. Shen Zhiming also added one more point - peasants who are landless or have little land. Labor hero Wang Gongliang said: "The original discussion was that all newly turned-over households should be included."

    Upon returning from the district, a meeting of peasant association group leaders was convened to mobilize everyone to find poor peasants in each group, and one hundred and eight were found at once. Gao Changfu said: "I thought this wouldn't work, there are leaks. I only secretly registered ten, and when I told Zhiming, he said: No (he thought the number was too small), so I called a meeting." Poor peasant Wang Hainiu told reporters: "Director Gao said at the meeting: 'We are not good enough! Too few, what should we do? Let's each find another one!' I said: 'If we expand like this, we won't be able to find enough even by the second or third month of the new year, let's each find another one.'" (That is to say, one person finds two). According to Gao Changfu, Zhiming planned to find one hundred to eighty, and I planned that the poor peasants could find sixty or so, plus twenty or thirty middle peasants, which would be enough.

    When it grew to twenty-five people, it was divided into three groups, and Liu Erheng, Wang [@] Lin, and Wang Shuanglai were selected as group leaders. Wang Hainiu said that these were selected as three "calling group leaders" - only in charge of calling people to meetings.

    In this way, finding and finding, in less than twenty days, it expanded to more than fifty poor peasants. Why did it develop so quickly? Wang Zhanquan, a member of the peasant association standing committee, said: "The method of development is pulling, you pull me, I pull you, for example, if the brother comes in, he will definitely pull the younger brother in, and everyone is embarrassed, so they approve it." Because these people were pulled in, many honest peasants, although they went in, still didn't know what to do. Poor peasant Hu Wude said: "It's fair to divide the land to others, I don't know what it's for." Wang Qiude (who was a long-term worker at the time of Wang Yirong's grandfather, the current district chief of the Ninth District of Wu'an) is still doing odd jobs now. He said: "I heard that the poor peasant league is called land redistribution! When will the meeting be held, I will go if they call me, and I won't go if they don't, I don't touch the inside." Even Wang Hainiu, the most active member of the "Poor Peasant League", did not know what the "Poor Peasant League" was for. Asked him why the poor peasants are called masters of the house? He said: "This has not been said yet!"

    某些干部企图在平分中夺取领导权
    西井组织假贫雇团
    斗争贫农助长浪费破坏土地法
    【本报消息】本报、新大众联合记者团，经过七天（一月三十号至二月五号）调查，发现武安六区南西井“贫雇团”，是被某些区、村干部操纵，企图在平分土地运动中夺取贫雇领导权的组织。
    土地法大纲公布以后，区上召集各村一部分干部、群众开会，解释土地法大纲，根本没有叫马上组织贫农团。想不到区公安干事申志明（南西井人，当过这村好几年村长，现在领导这个基点的工作）在从区里回南西井的路上，和这村副农会主任高长富说：“我只跟你讲，咱要组织贫雇团，你就能当贫雇团的头儿”。还在区上解释土地法以前，申志明就在南西井农会里说过：要贯彻贫雇路线，划清阶级界限。他说：“谁是贫雇？高长富就是，又贫又雇；谁是地主？胡廷选（政治主任）就是破落地主”。他对高长富说过：“平分土地运动一来，旧干部好多都要垮台。旧的下去了，新的起不来；只有你和王占全能干”。据他说：他的心思是为的“保存”高长富和王占全两个干部。所以，从区上回到村里，就积极进行组织贫雇团的活动。据高长富说：“志明说过，以后咱们贫雇要起来当家，干部不能当家了。我们要准备好，公事一来，咱们就布置好了。”果然，阴历腊月初，南西井的“贫雇团”宣布成立了。
    够什么条件才能参加贫雇团呢？高长富说：包庇地主不要，流氓不要，自私自利不要，透气分子也不要，要老实农民。申志明还补充了一条——要无地少地的农民。劳动英雄王功亮说：“原来讨论的是新翻身户都要。”
    从区上回来，就召集了个农会小组长会，发动大家在各组找贫雇，一下子找了一百零八个。高长富说：“我想到这样不行，有透气分子。我就只暗暗的登记了十个，给志明一说，他说：不着（嫌人太少），我就开了个会。”贫雇王海牛对记者说：“高主任在会上说过：‘咱这些人不行呀！太少，怎办？咱一个人再找一个吧！’我说：‘象这样扩充，到过年二、三月也找不起来，咱再一人找一个。’”（就是说一个人找两个）据高长富说：志明计划找一百至八十个，我计划贫雇能找六十来个，再配二三十个中农，就差不多够了。
    发展到二十五个人的时候，就划分了三个小组，选了刘二恒、王＠林、王双来三人当组长。王海牛说这是选了三个“叫人组长”——光管叫人开会。
    这样找来找去，不到二十天，就扩充到五十多个贫雇了。为什么发展的这样快？农会常委王占全说：“发展方法是拉的，你拉我，我拉你，比方哥哥进来了，一定把弟弟拉进来，大家也不好意思，就批准了。”因为这些人是拉进来的，所以许多老实农民虽然进去了，还不知道干什么。贫农胡五的就说：“把地给人家分公道就算，咱也不知道到底干什么。”王秋的（是现任武安九区区长王玉荣爷爷时的长工）现在还打短工，他说：“我听说贫雇团叫平分土地哩！啥时开会，叫去我就去，不叫就不去，咱也不摸里边的事。”连“贫雇团”最积极的王海牛，也不知道“贫雇团”是干啥的。问他为什么叫贫雇当家？他说：“这个还没有讲哩！”
