　　Eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, Smash All Ruling Institutions of the Chiang Family Dynasty!
    Chen Boda
    Mao Zedong's recent epoch-making revolutionary proclamation pointed out: "The People's Liberation Army issued a declaration in October 1947, which stated: 'Unite the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and all oppressed classes, all people's organizations, all democratic parties, all minority nationalities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements to form a national united front, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, and establish a democratic coalition government.' This is the most fundamental political program of the People's Liberation Army and also of the Chinese Communist Party." This is also the democratic republic of the joint democratic dictatorship of all revolutionary classes and the joint dictatorship of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people, as described in Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy." The fundamental problem of revolution is the problem of political power. A democratic regime jointly formed by all revolutionary classes must replace the fascist dictatorial regime of the big landlords and big comprador. The new democratic revolution of the Chinese people must eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and, at the same time, eliminate the entire foundation of the fascist dynasty of Chiang Kai-shek, the great feudal slave owner and comprador of big foreign firms. As Mao Zedong analyzed, the economic foundation of this counter-revolutionary dynasty is the feudal and semi-feudal land system and the feudal comprador's bureaucratic monopoly capital system. And its political foundation is the entire ruling apparatus of the warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents.
    Because Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty is under constant revolutionary attacks by the Chinese people and is extremely isolated in society, its set of blood-sucking institutions of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, inherited from the Manchu Dynasty and the Northern Warlords, has been continuously expanded to an extremely alarming scale, developing in direct proportion to the wealth of the Four Big Families. The number of personnel in Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary military institutions is as high as more than four million, along with other forms of armed forces, either overt or covert, such as police, military police, and secret agents. Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary bureaucratic apparatus, as far as the Chiang family's "Central" small court is concerned, was reported by a Xi'an newspaper in April 1946 as follows: "The number of 'Central' civil servants was no more than 10,000 at the end of the Qing Dynasty, no more than 20,000 in the early years of the Republic of China, 80,000 before the War of Resistance, and reached 270,000 in January of the 35th year. There were 130,000 public servants. In recent months, many new institutions have been added, such as the Northwest and Wuhan headquarters, various pacification commissions, and materials bureaus. As of April 10, the number of central civil servants will reach 300,000, public servants 150,000, and officials supporting servants 500,000, which is equivalent to supporting 2 million soldiers." As far as the local governments of the Chiang family court are concerned, a Peiping newspaper reported in October 1947: "The organization and staffing of local governments are indeed much larger than they were eight years ago. For example, before the autumn of the 28th year, a provincial government had four departments: Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, and two offices: Secretariat and Security, with a total of four or five hundred staff members. But now, in addition to the above four departments and two offices, the provincial government also has police, accounting, land and grain, social affairs, agriculture and forestry, health, cooperation, news, personnel, and other offices, as well as land administration, water conservancy, and assessment bureaus. Together with more than ten agencies operating outside the provincial government, there are more than thirty units in total, with a staff of as many as three to four thousand people. Another example is the county government of a first-class county, which had only three sections and one office before the autumn of the 28th year, with a staff of twenty or so people. Now, it has seven sections and eight offices, with the staff increased to more than two hundred people. As for the organizations below the county level, since the implementation of the new county system, there are township offices below the district offices, each with one head and deputy head, and more than ten clerks and secretaries. Below the township level, there are bao offices, each with one head and deputy head, and several clerks. For example, in a certain province in Southeast China, about ten thousand county government employees, more than twenty thousand district chiefs, instructors, township heads, deputy heads, clerks, and secretaries, and more than ten thousand bao heads and clerks were added in half a year, which is truly a grand sight." The figures listed here do not include the jia heads. According to some newspapers in 1946, the number of officials in the Chiang government had increased by 70% compared to 1937. But according to various materials, the actual increase was much greater than this estimate. Generally speaking, the Chiang family's bureaucratic apparatus, from the puppet "Central" to the baojia, includes at least one thousand several hundred thousand bureaucrats, which is a minimum figure. As for Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary secret agent apparatus, this is Chiang Kai-shek's most heinous new creation in all feudal comprador dynasties in China, a special symbol of Chiang Kai-shek's feudal comprador fascism, and includes at least hundreds of thousands of people. There are also many Kuomintang members and Three People's Principles Youth League members who, although not professional secret agents, are also coerced into doing some secret agent work. Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty relies on such an extraordinarily large ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, unique in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, and connects with all kinds of city foxes, village rats, and local tyrants and evil gentry in order to fight the people, plunder the people, protect the wealth of the Four Big Families, and suffocate the Chinese people. At the same time, it gradually and massively concentrates the people's hatred in order to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty. Of course, within all of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary ruling institutions, in addition to those warlords, reactionary politicians, corrupt officials, and die-hard secret agents, many people are forced to serve the Four Big Families. The soldiers in Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary army are all poor people who have been kidnapped. Many people in the bureaucratic institutions at all levels are only trying to make a living and do not necessarily intend to do bad things. There are also many who are genuinely kind-hearted and have not yet done anything bad. Due to the brutal oppression and exploitation by the Four Big Families, and as Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty is heading towards a major collapse politically, economically, and militarily, not only are the soldiers of the Chiang army suffering from greater hunger and cold, but many middle and lower-level officials and their families in the Chiang family government and army are also trapped in hunger and cold, seeking their own way out and way of life. Therefore, within all of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary institutions, a major rebellion against the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty is brewing. Completely smashing Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, and having the people and their representatives directly control all state ruling power, is to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's anti-national and anti-people counter-revolutionary political system. This will not only eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, but also ensure that after Chiang Kai-shek falls, there will never be anyone who can succeed him. During the Xinhai Revolution, although the Manchu Qing court fell, Yuan Shikai used the warlord and bureaucratic ruling apparatus of the Manchu Qing court to stage a counter-revolution. During the Great Revolution, although the Northern Warlords failed, Chiang Kai-shek used the ruling apparatus of the Northern Warlords to stage a counter-revolution. This is a great lesson of the revolution. Therefore, if we do not fundamentally smash Chiang Kai-shek's entire counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, and if we do not establish the new democratic political power of the Chinese people throughout the country, our revolution can never stop and can never achieve final victory. And eliminating the feudal and semi-feudal land system and the feudal comprador's bureaucratic monopoly capital system is the economic foundation for smashing Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus.
    The failure of the Political Consultative Conference further illustrates that as long as Chiang Kai-shek's set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents exists, the so-called "peace" and "democracy" resolutions can only be words written on white paper. And imperialist aggression is inevitably linked to that counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus. That set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus relies on imperialist aid to exist, and at the same time, imperialist aggression expands into China through that set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus. The upper-level ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, formed to suit the economic foundation of big landlords and big compradors, does not necessarily have to be represented by a fixed person. It can be represented by Empress Dowager Cixi, by Yuan Shikai, by Duan Qirui, or by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, or by Chiang Kai-shek. In short, any rogue scoundrel, turtle bastard, as long as there is a suitable opportunity, can be promoted by imperialists and Chinese reactionaries, either called "emperor," or called "president," or called "president" yesterday, and "emperor" today, or called "chairman of the National Government" today, and "president" tomorrow. The problem is the system. If that kind of feudal and semi-feudal colonial or semi-colonial economic system exists, there will be people suitable for that system. But which individual comes out is accidental. This explains why a murderous rogue and a cunning and insidious exchange broker like Chiang Kai-shek could become a great thief of a poor country and a great traitor, oppressing the Chinese people for as long as twenty years. At the same time, that system is not necessarily represented by a fixed person, and it is not necessarily represented by one person. As long as that system continues to exist, if the concentrated Yuan Shikai dies, it can be represented by decentralized Yuan Shikais. Now, when Chiang Kai-shek is at his end, American imperialism and Chinese feudal slave owners and big foreign firm compradors are also looking for gaps and plotting, attempting to preserve Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of warlord, bureaucratic, and secret agent ruling apparatus, and preparing to temporarily let Chiang Kai-shek step down as a last resort, using several decentralized Chiang Kai-sheks to replace the concentrated Chiang Kai-shek, in order to deceive the public and缓和the revolutionary offensive of the Chinese people, and then see how things go, and call the concentrated Chiang Kai-shek to re-enthronement and restoration tomorrow. Chiang Kai-shek has played the trick of so-called "stepping down" twice, once in August 1927 and the second time after the September 18th Incident. Now he is trying to play it a third time. But the Chinese people have a hundred years of experience, especially the experience of the First Great Revolution, the Ten Years of Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the armistice agreement and the Political Consultative Conference after Japan's surrender. All these experiences have been concentrated in Mao Zedong's extremely firm theories and policies. The Chinese people will no longer be fooled. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people must carry the revolution through to the end.
    Chiang Kai-shek's political concept is an enlarged and fascistized political concept of Yuan Shikai. This political concept is: relying on the anti-people's unlimited dictatorial power of imperialism and armed counter-revolution. This political concept reflects China's feudal and semi-feudal colonial or semi-colonial economic system, and also reflects the warlord, bureaucratic, and secret agent political system on this economic system. To eliminate this counter-revolutionary political concept, we must first eliminate this reactionary economic system and counter-revolutionary political system. And the fundamental driving force for eliminating this reactionary and counter-revolutionary economic system and political system is armed revolution based on peasant land reform. This is the great Mao Zedong Thought: "The characteristic and also the advantage of the Chinese revolution is that armed people oppose armed counter-revolution." Mao Zedong grasps this great truth every day, awake or asleep. The central force of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary system is his counter-revolutionary armed forces. Only by extinguishing Chiang Kai-shek's armed counter-revolution can we eliminate the system represented by Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the main form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle is armed struggle, using the people's armed forces to oppose armed counter-revolution and completely smash the armed counter-revolution. If the goal of completely smashing Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary armed forces is not achieved, it will be impossible to completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents.
    Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition Declaration said: "All those who combine military force with imperialism will fail, and conversely, all those who combine with the people to accelerate the progress of the national revolution will win." Facts have proved that Sun Yat-sen's assertion is completely pertinent. The counter-revolutionary army led by Chiang Kai-shek is combined with American imperialism, and the result is that it will fail. The revolutionary army led by Mao Zedong is combined with the people and is an army of the people themselves, and the result is that it will win. Now the task of the Chinese people is to intensify assistance and cooperation with the advancing great People's Liberation Army. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the time has come for the Chinese people to capture the public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, and finally smash Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty.
    In the past twenty years, the struggle between the two roads in China—Mao Zedong's road and Chiang Kai-shek's road—the question of who will win and who will lose has been completely determined. The winner is Mao Zedong's road, and the loser is Chiang Kai-shek's road. Mao Zedong's road is China's independence, freedom, and prosperity. Chiang Kai-shek's road is China's demise. These two roads are the two roads of the Chinese people's struggle against the anti-people and the revolution against the counter-revolution for a hundred years, concentrated in the past twenty years between a revolutionary camp headed by Mao Zedong and a counter-revolutionary camp headed by Chiang Kai-shek. The victory of Mao Zedong's road is the complete victory of the Chinese people. This is the complete end of China's colonial or semi-colonial feudal or semi-feudal economic and political system, and this is the complete end of Chiang Kai-shek's political concept. Mao Zedong said that the large-scale offensive of the People's Liberation Army against the Kuomintang-controlled areas is "the turning point from the development to the elimination of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years," which means that the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog in China fostered by worldwide imperialism for twenty years—especially by American imperialism in recent years—will mean that imperialism's enslavement of China will be gone forever.
    Mao Zedong called out: "Now is the historical era in which world capitalism and imperialism are heading for extinction, and worldwide socialism and democracy are heading for victory. The dawn is ahead, and we should work hard." Yes, after the Chinese people shed countless red blood—sacrificing countless lives, and after the Chinese people's helmsman Mao Zedong's unparalleled wisdom and courage, the dawn of boundless light is radiating on the Chinese mainland. The Chinese nation is being reborn, and all the Chinese people must make persistent efforts, respond to Mao Zedong's call, carry the revolution through to the end, and completely smash all the chains of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. And what the Chinese people will get is the entire great China.

　　消灭蒋介石，打碎蒋家小朝廷的全部统治机构！
    陈伯达
    毛泽东最近划时代的大革命文告指出来：“一九四七年十月人民解放军发表宣言，其中说：‘联合工农兵学商各被压迫阶级，各人民团体，各民主党派，各少数民族，各地华侨及其他爱国分子，组成民族统一战线，打倒蒋介石独裁政府，成立民主联合政府。’这就是人民解放军的、也是中国共产党的最基本的政治纲领。”这也就是毛泽东“新民主主义论”所说的各革命阶级的联合民主专政，一切反帝反封建的人们联合专政的民主共和国。革命的根本问题是政权问题，必须以各革命阶级联合的民主政权，代替大地主大买办的法西斯独裁政权。中国人民的新民主主义革命要消灭蒋介石，同时就是要消灭蒋介石这个大封建奴隶主、与大洋行买办的法西斯王朝的全部基础。正如毛泽东所分析，这个反革命王朝的经济基础，是封建半封建的土地制度与封建买办的官僚垄断资本制度。而它的政治基础，便是那军阀的、官僚的、特务的全部统治机构。
    由于蒋介石反革命王朝处在中国人民经常不断的革命袭击之中，它在社会中极端孤立，所以它那一套继承满清皇朝与北洋军阀而来的军阀的、官僚的、特务的吸血机构，不断扩充到极端惊人的庞大，并与四大家族的财富成正比例的发展。蒋介石反革命的军事机构的人数，庞大到四百多万，还有其他形式的或公开的或秘密的如警察、宪兵与特务的武装。蒋介石反革命的官僚机构，就蒋家“中央”小朝廷来说，据一九四六年四月间西安报载情形如下：“‘中央’公务员在满清末年不过一万人，民国初元亦不过两万人，抗战前八万，在三十五年一月已达二十七万人，公役十三万人，近月以来添设机关不少，如西北武汉等行营，各绥靖公署，物资局等，截至四月十日止，中央公务员将达三十万人，公役十五万人，养官役五十万，足等于养兵二百万。”就蒋家朝廷的地方政府来说，据一九四七年十月间北平报载：“目前地方政府的组织和编制，比较八年前的确已扩大了很多，例如省政府在二十八年秋季以前，有民、财、教、建四厅和秘书、保安二处，职员合计四五百人，但现在的省政府则除上述四厅二处外，尚有警务、会计、田粮、社会、农林、卫生、合作、新闻、人事等处，地政、水利、考核等局，再加上在省政府合署办公以外的十余机关，总计有三十余单位，职员多至三四千人。又如甲等县的县政府，在二十八年秋季以前，只有三科、一室，职员二十余人，现在则有七科、八室，职员增至二百余人。县以下的组织，自新县制实行后，区署以下有乡镇公所，每所有正副乡镇长各一、及干事书记等十余人。乡镇以下，有保公所，每所有正副保长各一及干事若干人。如在东南某省在半年内增添了县政府职员约万余人，区长、指导员、正副乡镇长、干事、书记等二万余人，正副保长和干事十几万人，真算洋洋大观了”。这里所列举的数字，是还没包括甲长在内的。据一九四六年有的报纸，载蒋政府的官员比一九三七年已增加了百分之七十。但按照各种材料看来，增加的数字比这个估计大得多了。大体上蒋家的官僚机构从伪“中央”到保甲，所有的官僚包括有一千数百万人，是一个最低的数字。至于蒋介石的反革命和特务机构，这是蒋介石在中国一切封建买办王朝中的罪大恶极的新作品，是蒋介石封建买办的法西斯主义的特别记号，至少也包括有数十万人。还有许多国民党员及三青团员，虽然不就是职业的特务，但是也被胁迫做些特务的工作。蒋介石反革命王朝，就是依靠这样古今中外特出的庞大的军阀的、官僚的、特务的统治机构，并联系各种城狐社鼠和土豪劣绅，以便和人民作战，掠夺人民，保护四大家族的财富，把中国人民压得喘不过气来。同时也把人民的仇恨步步地与大量地集中起来，以便打倒蒋介石王朝。当然，蒋介石一切反革命的统治机构内，除了那些军阀、反动政客、贪官污吏以及死心塌地的特务之外，很多人是被迫为四大家族服役的。蒋介石反革命军队中的兵士，都是穷苦老百姓被绑去当的。各级官僚机构内很多人，也仅是为的混饭吃，并不一定存心做坏事，也有不少真正存心良善，还没有做过坏事的。由于四大家族残暴的压迫和剥削，并当蒋介石反革命王朝在政治上、经济上、军事上走上大崩溃这个时候，不仅蒋军士兵们更加饥寒交迫，而蒋家政府及蒋家军内很多中下级的官员家属，也陷在饥寒交迫的境遇里面，而求谋自己的出路与生路。所以在蒋介石王朝一切反革命机构内，也正在酝酿着对于蒋介石王朝的大反叛。完全打碎蒋介石那全套反革命的军阀的、官僚的、特务的统治机构，而由人民及人民的代表直接掌握全部国家统治的权力，这就是消灭蒋介石反民族反人民的反革命政治制度。这样就不但消灭了蒋介石王朝，而且使蒋介石倒了之后，永远再没有可以继起之人。辛亥革命时候，满清朝廷虽然倒了，但袁世凯却利用了满清朝廷的军阀的、官僚的统治机构，再起反革命。大革命时候，北洋军阀虽然失败了，但蒋介石却利用了北洋军阀的统治机构，再起反革命。这是革命的大教训。所以如果没有根本打碎蒋介石反革命的全部军阀的、官僚的、特务的统治机构，如果没有在全国建立中国人民新民主主义的政治权力，我们的革命就决不能停止，决不能有最后的胜利。而消灭封建半封建的土地制度，和消灭封建买办的官僚垄断资本制度，乃是打碎蒋介石全套反革命统治机构的经济基础。
    政治协商会议的失败，加重说明了：只要蒋介石那一套反革命的军阀的、官僚的、特务的统治机构一日存在的话，那末所谓“和平”，所谓“民主”的决议，都只能是白纸写黑字的东西。而帝国主义的侵略，一定是和那反革命的统治机构联结在一起的。那一套反革命的统治机构，依靠帝国主义的援助而存在，同时帝国主义的侵略，也就经过那一套反革命的统治机构而向中国扩张。适应于大地主大买办的经济基础而形成的军阀的、官僚的、特务的上层统治机构，并不一定要由一个固定的人来代表，它可以由慈禧太后来代表，可以由袁世凯来代表，可以由段祺瑞来代表，可以由曹琨、吴佩孚来代表，可以由蒋介石来代表。总之任何流氓混蛋，乌龟王八，只要有个适当的机会，都可能被帝国主义者和中国反动派提拔起来，或叫“皇帝”，或叫“总统”，或在昨天叫“总统”，今天叫“皇帝”，或在今天叫“国民政府主席”，明天叫“总统”。问题是制度，有那种封建的与半封建的殖民地的或半殖民地的经济制度存在，便有和那种制度相适合的人出来。但是由那一个人出来，便是偶然的东西。这就说明了，为什么象蒋介石那样杀人越货的无赖流氓和阴猾险毒的交易所经纪人，竟然能够变成穷国大盗与卖国大盗，高压在中国人民头上达二十年之久。同时那种制度不但不一定由一个固定的人来代表，并且也不一定由一个人来代表。只要那种制度继续存在，集中的袁世凯死了，也可以由分散的袁世凯来代表，而现在美国帝国主义和中国封建奴隶主与大洋行买办，当蒋介石这个末日的时候，也正在寻找空隙，进行阴谋，企图在保存蒋介石的全套军阀的、官僚的、特务的统治机构的前提之下，准备于最不得已时暂时叫蒋介石下野，用几个分散的蒋介石以代替集中的蒋介石，以求迷惑视听，和缓中国人民冲天的革命进攻，而后再看情形，叫集中的蒋介石在明天再登基复辟。蒋介石玩弄过两次所谓“下野”的把戏，一次在一九二七年八月，第二次在九一八事变之后，现在正想玩弄第三次。但中国人民已有百年来的经验，特别是第一次大革命、十年内战、抗日战争以及日本投降以后停战协定和政治协商会议这几个伟大时期的经验，所有这些经验，已在毛泽东极端坚定的理论与政策中集中起来。中国人民将不再上当了，中国人民在毛泽东的旗帜下，必须把革命进行到底。
    蒋介石的政治观念是扩大了的与法西斯化了的袁世凯的政治观念，这种政治观念就是：依靠帝国主义的反人民的无限独裁权力与武装的反革命。这种政治观念是反映了中国封建的半封建的殖民地的或半殖民地的经济制度，又是反映了在这种经济制度上的军阀的、官僚的、特务的政治制度。要消灭这种反革命的政治观念，首先要消灭这种反动的经济制度与反革命的政治制度，而要消灭这种反动的反革命的经济制度与政治制度，根本的动力，就是以农民土地改革为基础的武装的革命。这是伟大的毛泽东思想：“中国革命的特点同时又是优点，是武装的人民反对武装的反革命。”毛泽东每天寤寐不忘地把握着这个伟大的真理。蒋介石反革命制度的中心力量，是他那反革命的武装。扑灭蒋介石武装的反革命，才可能消灭蒋介石所代表的制度。因此中国革命斗争的主要形式，乃是武装的斗争，以人民的武装反对武装的反革命，把反革命的武装打碎到底。如没有达到完全打碎蒋介石反革命的武装的目的，就无法完全打碎蒋介石那全套的军阀的、官僚的、特务的统治机构。
    孙中山的北上宣言说：“凡武力与帝国主义结合者无不败，反之，与国民结合以速国民革命进行者无不胜”。事实证明孙中山这个论断的完全中肯。蒋介石所领导的反革命军队，是与美国帝国主义结合，结果无不败；毛泽东所领导的革命军队，是与人民结合，为人民自己的军队，结果无不胜。现在中国人民的任务，就是加紧援助和配合前进中的伟大人民解放军，在毛泽东的领导下，中国人民活捉人民公敌蒋介石，最后打碎蒋介石的反革命王朝，已到了时候了。
    二十年来在中国的两条道路——毛泽东的道路与蒋介石的道路的生死斗争，谁胜谁败的问题，已完全确定了胜利者是毛泽东的道路；失败者是蒋介石的道路。毛泽东的道路，是中国的独立、自由和富强。蒋介石的道路，是中国的灭亡。这两条道路，是百年来中国人民与反人民，革命与反革命斗争的两条道路，而集中于二十年来一个以毛泽东为首的革命营垒，一个以蒋介石为首的反革命营垒之间的斗争。毛泽东道路的胜利，这就是中国人民的完全胜利，这就是中国殖民地的或半殖民地的封建的或半封建的经济政治制度的完全终结，这就是蒋介石政治观念的完全终结。毛泽东所说的人民解放军向国民党统治区的大进攻，乃是“一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点”，也就是说为全世界帝国主义二十年来所扶植——特别是美国帝国主义数年来所一手尽力扶植的在中国的走狗——蒋介石的败亡，帝国主义在中国的奴役也将一去而不复返了。
    毛泽东号召：“现在是在世界资本主义与帝国主义走向灭亡，全世界社会主义与民主主义走向胜利的历史时代，曙光就在前面，我们应当努力”。是的，经过中国人民流洒无量数的赤血——牺牲无量数的生命，经过中国人民舵手毛泽东智勇无双的启发，中国大陆上正在放射光芒无边的曙光。中国民族正在新生，全体中国人民必须再接再厉，迎接毛泽东的号召，把革命进行到底，完全粉碎帝国主义与蒋介石所有的锁链。而中国人民所得到的，就是整个伟大的中国。
