    [Taihang News] In Shentou Village, Shexian First District, after correcting the erroneous practice of cadres giving empty shares to hired and poor peasants, poor and middle peasants united closely for production. On the 3rd of this month, Village Chief Feng Qigui and Farmers' Association Director Qian Yueyi (also a mutual aid team leader) attended a production inspection meeting in the district. After discussion, they realized: "Allowing middle peasants to give empty shares to hired and poor peasants harms the interests of middle peasants and isolates the poor and hired peasants, which is detrimental to the poor and hired." They conducted self-criticism and accepted criticism. After returning to the village, they convened a meeting of cadres above the level of mutual aid team leader on the 4th to discuss corrective measures. First, Village Chief Feng Qigui made a self-criticism, saying: "Our village's emphasis on helping hired and poor peasants develop sideline occupations during this winter's major production campaign was correct, but because the cooperative, credit cooperative, and small mutual aid societies were not sufficiently connected, we failed to solve the problem of capital difficulties for hired and poor peasants to engage in sideline occupations, resulting in an emphasis on middle peasants helping hired and poor peasants enter empty shares, which affected everyone's production." After he finished speaking, everyone unanimously proposed to change course. Then, Qian Yueyi said: "Correcting empty shares is correct, but what should hired and poor peasants do if they don't have capital to engage in sideline occupations?" Cooperative Director He Xiting said: "There is a way, borrow from our credit cooperative." After the cadres unified their opinions, they decided to convene a hired and poor peasant meeting. At the hired and poor peasant discussion meeting, Feng Laiting said: "We and the middle peasants are one family. In the old society, we were all exploited and oppressed by landlords and rich peasants. Now it is very unreasonable for us to use empty shares to exploit them (referring to middle peasants). The main thing is to rely on our own production." Feng Zijing also said: "Relying solely on middle peasant help is not enough. I can sell 12,000 yuan worth of firewood in twenty days." Everyone said "Yes!" and proposed to borrow from the credit cooperative. When the middle peasants heard that the hired and poor peasants wanted to return the "empty shares," they were extremely happy and said: "This is very reasonable. In the future, we should help the hired and poor peasants find more avenues and unite well to engage in sideline occupations." After the change, the credit cooperative called for share subscriptions, and the middle and poor peasants immediately invested 910,000 yuan, plus the money from selling fruit and peppercorns, totaling 1,070,000 yuan, which was divided into four grades and lent to 83 poor peasants. Now the poor and middle peasants are very enthusiastic about engaging in sideline occupations.
    [Another Item] In Huyucun Village, Shexian First District, when correcting the erroneous practice of "mobilizing middle peasants to contribute money and labor to take care of hired and poor peasants," the cadres did not honestly examine themselves. Only when the leadership decided to change course and make corrections did they convene a hired and poor peasant meeting to discuss the matter, posing two questions. The first was "Should our production rely on middle peasant assistance or on our own labor?" The second was "Are the middle peasants and us one family, and is it appropriate for them to contribute money and labor to help us?" It took two nights to "get through" to the poor peasants' thinking. Everyone said: "It mainly depends on ourselves. It is not possible to rely solely on others' help without working." Later, they discussed it in the winter school jointly run by poor and middle peasants, and the hired and poor peasants expressed that "We don't want the money and labor that the middle peasants helped us with." Middle peasant Chen Baoku said: "Our help to you (referring to the hired and poor peasants) is sincere. We should produce well in the future, expand our shares, and the middle and poor peasants will have work to do every day, and the hired and poor peasants will not suffer difficulties." After this change, the middle peasants' production enthusiasm greatly increased. However, whether the production difficulties of the hired and poor peasants have been specifically resolved is not mentioned in the submission and remains to be investigated.

    神头纠正伤害中农的错误
    贫雇中农团结生产
    村干认识不深应继续检讨
    【太行消息】涉县一区神头村，纠正干部给雇贫入空股的错误作法后，贫中农亲密团结生产起来。本月三日，村长冯其贵，农会主任钱月义（也是互助组长）在区上开生产检查会，经过大家讨论，认识到：“让中农给雇贫入空股，既损害了中农利益，又孤立了贫雇，对贫雇是不利的。”他俩进行了检讨，接受了批评。回村后，在四号召开互助组长以上的干部会，讨论纠正办法。先由村长冯其贵检讨说：“咱村今冬大生产，强调扶助雇贫搞副业是对的，可是因为合作社、信用社和互助小型社联系不够，没做到解决雇贫搞副业的股金困难，才造成强调中农帮雇贫入空股，影响了大家生产。”他说罢，大家就一致提出要转湾。接着，钱月义说：“纠正入空股是对的，可是雇贫没有股金搞副业怎么办？”合作社长和喜亭说：“有办法，从咱信用社贷。”干部意见统一后，便决定召开雇贫会。在雇贫讨论会上，冯来亭说：“咱和中农本是一家人，在旧社会都受地主富农的剥削压迫，现在咱又用上空股来剥削他（指中农），是很不合理的。主要应靠自己生产。”冯子敬也说：“光靠中农帮助不行，我割柴二十天，就能卖洋一万二千元。”大家都说“对！”提出要到信用社贷款。中农听说雇贫要退“空股”，高兴极了，都说：“这可很合理，以后咱可应该多帮助雇贫找门路，好好团结搞副业。”转湾后，信用社号召入股，中贫农一下入了九十一万元，加上卖果实花椒钱，共合一百零七万元，一齐分四等贷给了八十三户贫苦农民。现在贫中农搞副业的劲头很大。
    【又息】涉县一区胡峪村，在纠正“动员中农拿钱和工照顾雇贫”的错误作法时，干部没有老老实实的检讨自己，只是当领导上决定让转湾纠正的时候，才去召开雇贫会讨论，并提出两个问题，头一个是“咱生产靠中农帮助，还是靠自己劳动？”第二个是“中农和咱是一家，他拿出钱和工帮助咱是不是合适”？费了两黑夜的时间去“闹通”贫农的思想，大家说：“主要是靠自己，不劳动只别人帮助也不行。”后来又到贫中农合伙的冬学里讨论，雇贫表示了“中农帮助咱的钱和工不要了”，中农陈保库这样说：“俺帮助你（指雇贫）可是真心，咱今后好好生产，扩大股金，咱中贫农天天有活做，雇贫就不受困难啦。”经过这样转湾后，中农生产情绪大大提高。但雇贫生产困难是否具体解决，来稿却未提及，尚待访查。
