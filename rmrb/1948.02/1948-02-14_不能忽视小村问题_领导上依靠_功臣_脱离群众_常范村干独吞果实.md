    The Problem of Small Villages Cannot Be Ignored: Leaders Rely on "Meritorious Servants," Separating Themselves from the Masses; Chang Fan Village Cadre Monopolizes Fruits of Struggle

    [Ci County News] Chang Fan Village is a relatively poor village of 305 people, only three *li* away from Pengcheng Town. From its liberation in August 1945 until September of last year, the district office never sent a work team member to reside in the village. They always thought that with the leadership of Kong Fanchang (actually a rogue) who had made outstanding contributions during the War of Resistance, there would be no problems, and entrusted everything to him alone. Kong Fanchang was one of the three major cadres in the village, serving as the director of civil education and general manager of the cooperative, holding all power. The chairman of the farmers' association, Tian Shulu, was someone who offended no one, tried to please everyone (both poor peasants and landlords said he was good), and had no class stance. The vice chairman of the workers' union, Chen Wenxiu, obeyed Kong Fanchang in everything. The masses reflected: "Kong Fanchang's mouth, Chen Wenxiu's legs." Liu Wuwei (the current political director, one of the three minor cadres of the past) said: Young cadres and militia members were arguing in the room, but as soon as they heard Kong Fanchang "humph" once, they became silent. With great power in his hands, he acted recklessly, controlling the distribution of the fruits of struggle and managing everything in the cooperative. He openly engaged in illicit affairs in the village. Later, after the Party made it public, he became the political director, and no one dared to provoke him even more. During the anti-traitor and revenge period in January 1946, a total of 32,660 yuan were struggled back over a period of forty days. After the struggle ended, when the masses requested to borrow the struggle funds, Kong Fanchang said: This money was for the traitors who wanted to shoot me and Kong Lingjiao who had already been killed, so this money should belong to us. The chairman of the farmers' association and the township head used this money to trade grain in the village and town, Kong Fanchang used it freely, and the cadres borrowed it freely, eating and drinking lavishly. Poor peasant Lin Guangyin reflected: "We accompanied them for forty days for nothing!" When 70 *mu* of dry land and 2 *mu* of paddy land were distributed in April 1946 (the village had an average of 0.0167 *mu* of paddy land per person), Kong Fanchang told the appraisers: Distribute the 2 *mu* of paddy land to Suo Youliang! The appraisers had to comply. It turned out that Kong Fanchang was openly having an affair with Suo Youliang's sister-in-law, and he even incited her to marry him. During the large-scale land reform movement in July, after a month of struggle, 205,000 yuan were struggled back. When it came to the distribution, Kong Fanchang told Chen Wenxiu: "I want to get married and need 50,000 yuan." Chen Wenxiu told the appraisers, and 50,000 yuan were distributed to him. The other twelve cadres received 30,000 yuan, the thirteen militiamen received 30,000 yuan, the twelve families of revolutionary soldiers received 50,000 yuan, and the 96 masses and 53 members of the women's association each received 200 yuan, totaling 30,600 yuan. Regardless of whether they were landlords, rich peasants, poor peasants, or middle peasants, as long as they attended the meeting, they were divided equally by person and class. Landlord and old team leader Kong Fanwei, and landlord and logistics director Kong Lingcai, were actively working, so they each received 2,500 yuan, the same as the cadres. The bankrupt landlord and village secretary Suo Guangrong received 3,000 yuan, the same as the top cadres. His brother Suo Guangyin received 2,000 yuan as a militiaman's share. Suo Yougong, who had been struggled against, received 1,000 yuan. Poor peasant Lin Guangyin did not want the 200 yuan he was given, but the cadres insisted on giving it to him, and he resentfully bought half a catty of pork and ate it.

    During the filling-in period in November, 199,300 yuan were struggled. 23,300 yuan were spent on buying leather belts and fur hats for the militia, 14,200 yuan were spent on buying white cloth to make coats for the militia and for travel expenses, 96,000 yuan were spent on Kong Fanchang buying a pistol and pistol bullets, 37,000 yuan were spent on preferential treatment for soldiers during the New Year, and the remaining 28,800 yuan were deposited with the chairman of the farmers' association.

    In total, in the distribution of the above-mentioned fruits of struggle, Kong Fanchang received over 160,000 yuan, accounting for 30.66% of the total amount of money, which was equivalent to the amount received by 2304 men and women from the masses. The 4,170 yuan he received by falsely claiming to be a family member of a revolutionary soldier was not included. 132,300 yuan were spent on buying rifles and bullets, accounting for 31.55%. The twelve cadres received 199,790 yuan, accounting for 24.66%, with each cadre receiving the equivalent of the fruits of struggle received by 152 people from the masses. (The 43,200 yuan temporarily stored with the chairman of the farmers' association was not included, as it was used as a flexible fund for cadres to borrow.) The thirteen militiamen received 67,500 yuan, equivalent to 1683 catties of rice, accounting for 3.73% (including the money distributed to the militia, and the money spent on buying leather belts, fur hats, overcoat cloth, and travel expenses). Each militiaman received the equivalent of the fruits of struggle received by 25 people from the masses. The twelve family members of revolutionary soldiers received 87,000 yuan, accounting for 5%, with each family member receiving the equivalent of the fruits of struggle received by 31 people from the masses. The 96 men from the masses received 20,000 yuan, accounting for 1.27%. The 53 members of the women's association received 10,600 yuan, accounting for 0.67%. Each time the cadres hosted a banquet, they wasted 9,060 yuan (for a total of 40 people), accounting for 2.24%. One meal was equivalent to the fruits of struggle received by 168 people from the masses. Other furniture, clothing, and farm tools were distributed without discussion, and the cadres said, "Whoever needs what, just pick it!" The masses rushed to take things, and relatives and friends generously gave way to each other, "You need this, so I'll give it to you." Wang Lizheng, an old bachelor who had been a long-term worker for over 50 years and had no land, saw that no one was letting him have anything, so he left. Later, someone brought him a small table, and he said, "Am I going to have a landlord's table to eat at!" Old peasant Kong Qinglu said, "I only received two tattered pairs of pants and a tattered quilt in the struggle." The cadres said, "Poor peasants don't have livestock, so it's useless to distribute plows and seeders." Therefore, they were all distributed to middle peasant households, or newly turned middle peasant households.

    Kong Fanchang, after being patiently educated by the Pengcheng District Committee of the Communist Party in September of last year, still stubbornly clung to his mistakes despite several self-criticisms, and refused to bow his head to the masses. At a mass meeting of the entire village, the district committee accepted the opinions of the masses and announced his expulsion from the Party and the removal of his position as political director. However, the excess fruits of struggle he had seized had not yet been returned.

    不能忽视小村问题
    领导上依靠“功臣”脱离群众
    常范村干独吞果实
    【磁县消息】常范村是离彭城镇只三里，有三百零五人的比较穷苦的小村。自从一九四五年八月解放到去年九月以前，区公所从来没派过一个工作员去这村住过，总以为他村有在抗战中功绩卓著的孔凡昌（实际是个流氓）的领导，保险出不了问题，一切都委靠他一人掌管。孔凡昌在村是三大干部之一，任民教主任兼合作社总经理，一切大权在握。农会主席田书禄是一个谁都不惹、两头落好（贫农和地主都说他好），没阶级立场的人。副工会长陈文秀是一切服从孔凡昌。群众反映：“孔凡昌的嘴，陈文秀的腿”。刘五味（现任政治主任，是过去三小干部之一）说：青年干部民兵正在房内吵闹，一听孔凡昌“哼”一声，就鸦雀无声了。他的大权在手，胡作胡为，掌握斗争果实的分配，管理合作社的一切。在村公开搞破鞋，后来经过党公开，担任了政治主任，更是没人敢惹了。一九四六年一月反奸复仇时期，前后共斗争了四十天，斗争回洋三二六六○○元。斗争结束后，群众要求借用斗争款，孔凡昌说：这是汉奸要打我的黑枪和已打死的孔令椒的，这款应归我们所有。农会长和乡长等拿这款去和村镇贩卖粮食，孔凡昌自由使用，干部们自由借用，大吃大喝。贫农吝光银反映：“我们争了四十天全是陪伴了！”四六年四月分配七十亩旱地，二亩水地时（该村每人平均水地一分六七），孔凡昌告评议员说：将二亩水地分给索有良！评议员只得照办。原来孔凡昌与索有良弟妇公开搞破鞋，他还挑拨人家和他结婚。七月土地改革大运动时期，经过一个月斗争，斗回二○五○○○元，在分配时孔凡昌告陈文秀：“我要娶老婆，用洋五万元”。陈文秀就转告评议员，就分给他五万元。其他干部十二人，分三万元，民兵十三人分三万元，抗属十二人分五万元，群众九十六人，妇女会五十三人，每人各批二百元，共三万零六百元。不管地主、富农、贫农、中农只要到会，按人按类平分。地主、老年队长孔凡为和地主、抗勤主任孔令才，因工作积极，都分到干部分二千五百元，破落地主村书记索光荣，批到头等干部分三千元，其弟索光银，批民兵果实二千元，被斗户索有功，批洋一千元；贫农吝光银不要分的二百元，干部们硬给了他，他气恨的买了半斤猪肉吃了。
    十一月填补时期，斗争了一九九三○○元，给民兵买皮带、毛帽花洋二三三○○元，给民兵买白布做大衣拿盘费花洋一四二○○元，孔凡昌要买手枪和手枪子弹花九六○○○元，过年优抗花洋三七○○○元，余洋二八八○○元存在农会长手中。
    总计以上果实的分配，孔凡昌得十六万余元，合占全部果实款百分之三○·六六，顶住二三○四个男女群众分的。假充抗属分到一份果实四一七○元未计在内。买长枪、子弹花洋一三二三○○元，合占百分之三一·五五。干部十二人得一九九七九○元，占百分之二四·六六，每干部顶住一五二个群众得果实。（暂存农会长手中的四三二○○元，经当作干部借用的机动款，没算在内。）民兵十三人分到六七五○○元，合米一六八三斤，占百分之三·七三，（指给民兵分的款、买皮带、毛帽、大衣布、盘费都在内）每个民兵顶住二五个群众所得的果实。抗属十二人分到八七○○○元，占百分之五，每个抗属顶三十一个群众所得果实。男群众九十六人，分二万元，占百分之一·二七。妇女会五十三人，分一○六○○元，占百分之○·六七。干部们每请客一次浪费九○六○元（共四十人），占百分之二·二四。吃一顿等于群众一六八人所得果实。其他在分配家具、衣服、农具时，也不评议，干部说：“谁需啥拣啥！”群众都纷纷去取，亲族厚友都相互尽让，“你缺这给你。”一个住过五十余年长工的外来户一亩地没有的老光棍汉王立正，看看人家没有人尽让自己，他就走，后来别人给他搬来一个小桌，他说：“咱还闹个老财桌子吃饭咧！”贫农孔庆禄老汉说：“我在斗争中只分到两条烂裤子，一个烂被子。”干部说：“贫农没牲口，分犁耧没有用。”因此都分给中农户，或翻透身的新中农户。
    孔凡昌于去年九月经彭城中共区委会耐心教育，虽经过几次反省，仍然固执错误，不向群众低头。在全村群众大会上区委会接受群众意见，宣布开除他的党籍，行政上撤消他的政治主任职务，但多余侵占的斗争果实还未退出。
