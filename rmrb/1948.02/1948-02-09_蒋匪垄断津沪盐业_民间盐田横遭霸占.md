    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. According to consolidated news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: The Chiang bandits are actively monopolizing the production and sale of salt in the Changlu and Shanghai salt districts. The Tianjin branch of the China Salt Industry Corporation, the salt industry trust established by Chiang Kai-shek, exclusively controls nearly 40% of the total output of civilian salt fields in the Hangu, Tanggu, and Xinhe areas of the Changlu district. Furthermore, it has established a chemical plant in Dagu to trial-produce refined salt, bleaching powder, liquid sodium hydroxide, and other products, monopolizing the North China market. Relying on political power, this corporation seizes civilian salt fields. Among the salt fields "taken over" from the Japanese, 35 in Xinhe and several salt flats in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts of Dagu have not yet been returned to private operation. Appeals from the owners to the Chiang Kai-shek Nanjing government have been shelved. The Changlu District Salt Administration of the Chiang bandits has increased the salt tax to 250,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg) starting from January 1st this year, with even inferior salt taxed at 200,000 yuan. Salt that had already left the salt fields and was being transported to Peiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou before the end of the year was also forcibly prohibited from being transported by the Chiang bandits in preparation for tax increases. Since the Chiang bandits monopolized the North China salt industry, civilian salt production has greatly decreased. Last year, civilian salt production in the Changlu district was only over 5.3 million dan, approximately 56% of the estimated output. The salt farmers of Pudong in Shanghai are also being severely exploited under the strict control of the Yuanpu Salt Field Administration of the Chiang bandits. This salt administration opens salt warehouses, purchasing civilian salt at low prices and issuing IOUs (white slips) in lieu of salt payments, or deliberately delaying salt payments for over ten days before issuing them to the salt farmers, or refusing to accept salt under the pretext of full warehouses. At the same time, they send police to obstruct the salt farmers, falsely accusing them of smuggling, and prohibiting them from carrying salt home, in order to achieve the purpose of oppression. In October of last year, over a hundred salt farmers were brutally beaten under such circumstances. This administration also extorts so-called "welfare fees" from the salt farmers, a practice that has been going on for two years. In selling salt, they arbitrarily raise prices to exploit the people. In December of last year, in addition to the "official price" increasing to 60,000 yuan per dan, and a salt tax of 100,000 yuan, there was also a so-called "business fee" of 40,000 yuan.

    蒋匪垄断津沪盐业
    民间盐田横遭霸占
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋匪积极垄断长芦、上海两盐区的食盐产销。其盐业托辣斯中国盐业股份有限公司天津分公司在长芦区的汉沽、塘沽、新河三地独占的盐场产量，已近民间全部盐场产量的百分之四十；且在大沽设立化学工厂，试产再制盐及漂白粉、液体氢氧化钠等，独霸华北市场。该公司依仗政治权力，霸占民间盐田，其由日寇手中“接收”的盐田中，即有新河的三十五幅，大沽一、二、三、四、五区的若干盐滩，迄未还归民营，各业主向蒋匪南京政府控诉，亦遭搁置。蒋匪长芦区盐管局今年一月一日起已将盐税提高至每担廿五万元，次等食盐亦征税廿万元。年底前已出盐场运至平、津、张家口之盐斤，亦曾被蒋匪强力禁止转运，以备增税，自蒋匪垄断华北盐业以来，民盐产量大减，去年长芦区民盐仅产五百三十余万担，约合预计产量百分之五十六。上海的浦东盐民亦在蒋匪袁浦盐场公署的严厉管制下，横被剥削。该盐署开设盐仓，低价统购民盐，且印发白票以代盐价，或故意拖欠盐价周转十数日后始发给盐民，或借口仓满，拒绝收盐，一面又派警察阻拦盐民，诬以走私，不准挑盐回家，以达压榨目的。去年十月且有百余盐民以此类情形遭受毒打。该署并向盐民勒征所谓“福利费”，行之已达两年。其销售食盐，则任意抬价剥削人民，去年十二月间，每担除“正价”增至六万元，加收盐税十万元外，并有所谓“业务费”四万元。
