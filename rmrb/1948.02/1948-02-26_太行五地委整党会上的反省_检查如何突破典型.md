　　Self-criticism at the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting
  　Examining How to Break Through Typical Examples
    Hu Liansheng
    (From Yushe, Shanxi, of peasant origin, hired laborer background, joined the Party in November 1939, began working in the district in December 1942, currently serving as Secretary of the Third District Sub-Committee in Anyang.)
    In February 1944, when I was a Sub-Committee member in the Fourth District of Yushe, Sub-Secretary Chen Ping favored seeing Shi Kuiwen the most because he was eloquent and literate, and looked down on me. I thought honest people didn't get ahead, so I resolved to learn to read; I compiled statistics and made reports, thinking that this would make the higher-ups trust me. In June 1946, I was transferred to Anyang and became the Deputy Secretary of the Sub-Committee. I was determined to perform better so that the higher-ups would promote me to Sub-Committee Secretary. In my work, I adopted the approach of creating typical examples, keeping up with the times, and showing off. During the double reduction [of rent and interest] campaign, I relied on my experience in rent reduction in the old liberated areas and depended on a group of hooligans and daredevils to reduce rents, which resulted in following the middle peasant and bankrupt landlord line (middle peasants earned more from rent, bankrupt landlords had more debts, and the poor and hired peasants didn't benefit). In order to create complete materials, I exaggerated the advantages, saying how enthusiastic the masses were and how deeply I had gone into the grassroots, which is why the masses were mobilized… This false report reached the county, "People's Voice" (a small newspaper in Anyang) published it, and the New China Daily also printed it. As a result, I became well-known, and I achieved the goal of becoming the Sub-Committee Secretary. During the great liquidation [land reform], I went to Qingliu Village, wanting to show off in a large village. First, I knocked down the cadres of Liang Village and found a group of ruffians to do the work, showing my concern for the poor. In fact, at that time, I only had a poor person's viewpoint. I thought the people of Anyang were cunning and pragmatic, and the masses wouldn't work without benefit, and cadres wouldn't work hard without rewards. In guiding the movement, I seized this characteristic, using typical examples to promote the general. I used cadres as models of grievance to guide the masses, rewarding the active and promoting the backward, so that the masses could see that active participants could get more things, and everyone would participate. But as a result, the cadres divided up all the good things, and when the masses rose up, there was nothing left to divide. The cadres turned over, but forgot the poor. At the end of the great liquidation, Xijishan in the Second District launched the "knocking down the running dogs" campaign. Fearing that I would fall behind the Second District, I also started doing it to keep up with the times. I heard Comrade He Gaoming say: "You can't enter the front door without knocking down the running dogs." I thought that in the past, when beggars went to the landlord's door, they wouldn't get food without first beating the dog. If they were careless, the dog would bite them. So I proposed: "If you want to turn yourself over completely, you must knock down the running dogs before entering the front door." In Xiqingliu Village, the "knocking down the running dogs" campaign attacked fifty-five people (poor and hired peasants accounted for fifty-two). Not only did the poor and hired peasants not turn over, but the things they had turned over were also returned, and they even lost their capital. When dividing the fruits, the running dogs could only get half (masses got one dou, running dogs got five sheng), driving the poor and hired peasants far away. Peasants fought peasants, landlords watched the fun, which was the most detached from the masses. When I reported to the county, I only talked about the good aspects and didn't mention the panic and fear of the masses. The county committee, after hearing the typical report, praised me again. In fact, I attacked the poor and hired peasants and deceived the higher-ups. In order to create typical examples and keep up with the times, I created "rupture-ism" when working in Dawulijian. I convened meetings of poor and hired peasants, but everyone was afraid and dared not rise up. At that time, I thought: "Poor and hired peasant backbones, poor and hired peasants dare not." I thought the poor and hired peasants were backward and had to be forced to tear off their masks, so I forced the masses to struggle. They were forced to tear their faces with the landlords, and the more they were forced, the more afraid the masses became. This time I realized that I was driven by individualistic thinking of striving for championships in my work, and my style of work was simply to complete the task and to gain the trust of the higher-ups, making false reports and deceiving the higher-ups. I treated the masses as my long-term laborers, telling them to do whatever I said. If they didn't do it, they were "backward." I didn't treat the poor and hired peasants as my class brothers and sisters, go all out to mobilize them, and raise their awareness.

　　太行五地委整党会上的反省
  　检查如何突破典型
    胡连生
    （山西榆社人，成份贫农，雇工出身，三九年十一月入党，四二年十二月到区工作，现任安阳三区分委书记。）
    四四年二月，我在榆社四区当分委，分书陈平同志最爱见石魁文，因他能写会说，看不起我。思想老实人吃不开，决心学习识字；统计数目做汇报，觉得这样就能使上级相信。四六年六月，调到安阳，当了分委副书记，我抱着表现好些，叫上级提拔我当分书。工作中是采取搞典型，赶时髦，显示自己。在双减时我是凭着我有老区的减租经验，依靠一批流氓二杆子，敢打敢干的减了租，结果走了中农破落户路线（中农吃租子多，破落户债务多，贫雇群众没有得了利）。为了搞成个完整的材料，扩大优点，说群众如何热烈，我个人是如何深入，群众才发动起来的……，假报告到县里，“人民呼声”（安阳小报）呼出来了，新华日报也照样登出来了。这样一来，我就吃开了。分委书记的目的也达到了。大清算时，我到清流村想在大村露一手，首先把梁村的干部打了下去，找了一伙觅汉来干，表现自己对穷人关心。实际当时也只是有穷人观点，我认为安阳人滑头又是实利主义，群众没利不干，干部不奖不好好的干，我在指导运动时，就抓住了这个特点，用典型推动一般。把干部当做诉苦典型，引导群众，奖励积极，推动落后，使群众看见当积极分子的可以多分东西，都起来干。但结果好东西干部分光了，群众起来也没东西分了。干部翻了身，忘了穷人。大清算的末尾，二区西积善展开了敲狗腿，这时我怕落了二区的后，为了赶时髦也干开了。听何高明同志说：“不敲狗腿不能进大门。”我想从前要讨吃的到了老财门口，不先打狗，要不上饭，一不小心狗要咬。所以我就提出了：“要想翻透身，必须敲了狗腿进大门。”西清流村敲狗腿打击了五十五个人（贫雇占五十二人）。贫雇不仅没有翻了身，翻的东西也倒出来了，不够又赔了老本。分果实狗腿只能分一半（群众分一斗，狗腿分五升），把贫雇都打的远远的。农民斗农民，地主看笑话，这是最脱离群众的事情。往县作报告，我又是光说好，对于群众的恐慌害怕都没有谈。县委听了典型报告，又表扬了一番，实际上打击了贫雇，欺骗了上级。为了创造典型，赶时髦，在大五里涧工作时，创造了“抓破主义”，召集贫雇开会，大家害怕不敢起来，我当时觉得：“贫雇骨干，贫雇不敢”。认为贫雇落后，非逼着撕破脸不行，便强迫群众斗争。硬和地主撕破脸，结果越逼群众越怕。这次我认识了：我在工作中是种个人主义的争锦标思想，作风上是单纯的为了完成任务，为了叫上级信任，做假报告，欺骗上级。对群众认为是我的长工，叫你干啥，你干啥，你不干就是“落后”，没有把贫雇当做自己的阶级弟兄，去好好的发动，提高他们的觉悟。
