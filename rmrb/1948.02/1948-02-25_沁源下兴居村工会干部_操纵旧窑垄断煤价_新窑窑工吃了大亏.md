　　【Qinyuan News】 Jiao Jinrong, a standing committee member of the Qinyuan County Branch of the Trade Union, colluded with trade union cadres in Xiaxingju Village to manipulate the village's old coal kilns and monopolize coal prices, causing losses to workers in newly opened kilns. Xiaxingju Village in the third district of Qinyuan County has three coal kilns, one of which is larger in scale and has better quality coal. County Trade Union Standing Committee member Jiao Jinrong, village trade union chairman Qin Rongsheng, and several other village cadres all have shares in it. Qin Rongsheng is the kiln's accountant and is essentially the person in charge of this kiln. This kiln is close to the main road and has many customers, so business is booming. It is said that each person can earn a gross profit of one dou of millet per day. Another kiln was newly opened by Qin Genyou, Jiao Tufu, Wang Huer, and other six mutual aid group members. Because this kiln is newly built, the coal is not as good, and the road is not smooth. Coal carts always have to pass by the old kiln first. The new kiln has virtually no business, and the coal produced cannot be sold.
    The new kiln officially started work on October 12th of the lunar calendar (road construction in the kiln began in September). Each of the six people paid two dou of millet and two jin of sesame oil as advances. After a month of labor, they burned 30,000 jin of lump coal, which could not be sold. Trade Union Standing Committee member Jiao Jinrong told them, "No one is allowed to sell it cheaply, the price must be unified, and no one is allowed to call for carts from outside. Whoever sells cheaply or calls for carts deserves to be beaten to death." Because the coal from the new kiln was not as good, it could not be sold at the same price (two sheng of millet per tuo). The hired poor workers had to comply, but with 30,000 jin of lump coal unsold, the two dou of millet were eaten, and the two jin of oil were used up, so they had to stop work immediately. So they went to Jiao Jinrong and Qin Rongsheng to discuss. Jiao said, "Save up one or two hundred thousand jin first." But these hired poor workers were struggling to earn a living, where would they get so much capital to save up one or two hundred thousand jin of lump coal before selling it? Because the coal could not be sold and they could not buy oil and rice, they could not continue to work, so the workers often went to the trade union to ask to sell some lump coal to the hospital. The cadres not only did not agree to their request, but Jiao Jinrong also angrily said, "Don't even think about the hospital's business." The hired poor workers were very discouraged. Should they give up? Then this new kiln would not be built. Should they continue? They couldn't work on an empty stomach! They couldn't work without oil for lamps! So they went to the chairman of the Joint Association, Qin Xuanwen, but he didn't give them a clear answer. They went several times, and he always vaguely promised to solve the problem, but it dragged on for more than a month. The workers sometimes worked, sometimes stopped, and sometimes worked for a morning and drank a bowl of thin porridge, which was very uncomfortable. Village head Dou Guangxi and Farmers' Association Chairman Qin Genshuan were a little anxious. Later, although the Joint Association tried to find some solutions, it always could not pass through the trade union, and the hired poor workers were not very satisfied. Finally, the hospital convened a meeting with the village head, the Joint Association, the trade union (Qin Rongsheng), the Farmers' Association (Qin Genshuan), and the heads of the two kilns to study the matter, and it was decided that the hired poor kiln would sell 30,000 jin of lump coal to the hospital and borrow 60,000 yuan in silver dollars in advance to buy oil and rice to continue working. Recently, they produced some more coal, which still could not be sold, but they did not dare to mention it to the trade union, so they had to go out and find the recuperation company and sell 30,000 jin of lump coal and 150 tuo of black coal. Jiao Jinrong still said behind their backs, "They have no organization and are too proud!"
    The hired poor workers said, "Because it is a newly built kiln, it took a lot of time to repair the road (the road in the kiln) and to pass the ridge (the big stone ridge in the kiln must be passed before there is coal). Because we could not sell coal, we lost a month or two. For the three months up to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, those who did well earned 36,000 yuan in silver dollars and nine sheng of millet per person. However, in the three months, each person spent one shi and three dou of millet (equivalent to more than 26,000 yuan), and ten jin of sesame oil (1,200 yuan per jin), equivalent to 12,000 yuan. The above expenditures totaled more than 38,000 yuan. Adding the nine sheng of millet, equivalent to 2,000 yuan. It's just breaking even, but also got a road (the kiln road)."

　　沁源下兴居村工会干部
  　操纵旧窑垄断煤价  新窑窑工吃了大亏
    【沁源消息】沁源县支工会常委焦金荣，结合下兴居村工会干部，操纵该村旧煤窑，并垄断煤价，迫使新开窑的窑工吃了亏。沁源三区下兴居村共有三坐煤窑，其中一坐规模较大，炭亦较好，是一坐老窑。县支工会常委焦金荣，村工会主席秦荣生，还有其它几个村干部，都有股金。秦荣生是窑上的会计，实际上成了这坐窑的负责人。此窑离大路近，顾主多，所以买卖兴隆，据说每天每人可得毛利小米一斗。另一坐窑是雇贫互助组秦根有、焦土福、王虎儿等六人新开的窑，这坐窑因是新建设，炭不算好，路亦不顺，拉炭车总得先路过那坐老窑。新窑上简直就没生意，出来的炭无法出售。
    新窑阳历十月十二日正式开工（九月间就开始修窑里的路），六个人每人支垫出小米二斗，麻油二斤。劳动一个月，烧出了三万斤兰炭，无法出售。支工会常委焦金荣告给他们说：“不准贱卖一斤，价钱要统一，不准出外边叫车，谁贱卖，谁叫车，打死亦活该。”新窑的炭不好，一样价（二升小米一驼）就卖不出去。雇贫工人们只好遵命，可是三万斤兰炭卖不出去，二斗小米吃完了，二斤油点完了，马上就得停工。于是便找焦金荣、秦荣生商量。焦说：“你存下个一二十万斤再说。”可是这些雇贫工人们指苦求财，从哪里有那么大的抵垫（资本），让存个一二十万斤兰炭再说呢？炭卖不了，买不回油和米，便无法继续劳动下去，所以工人们经常去找工会要求卖给医院一部分兰炭。干部不仅没答应他们的要求，而且焦金荣还生气的说：“医院的买卖你们就不要想。”雇贫工人非常泄气，放下不干吧？这坐新窑便建设不成。继续干吧？不能饿着肚子干呀！没油点亦不行呀！便找到联会主席秦宣文，但亦没说了个长短。连找几次，总是似是而非答应解决，就这样拖了一个多月。工人们有时劳动，有时停止，有时劳动一上午，喝一顿稀饭，真难受极了。村长豆光玺、农会主席秦根拴，都有些着急，以后联会虽给想些办法，可是总通不过工会，雇贫工人亦不很满意。最后还是由医院召集村长、联会、工会（秦荣生）、农会（秦根拴），和两个窑上的负责人开会研究，才算决定由雇贫窑上卖给医院三万斤兰炭，预借给雇贫大洋六万元，以便买油买米继续劳动下去。最近他们又出了些炭，还是无法出售，但又不敢向工会提，只好出去找到休养连，卖了三万斤兰炭，一百五十驼黑炭。焦金荣还在背后说他们：“没有组织，有自高性哩！”
    雇贫工人们这样说：“由于是新建设窑，修路（窑里的路），过棱（窑里的大石棱过去才有炭），浪费很多时间，卖不了炭误了个把月，到正月十五整三个月，做的好每人分大洋三万六千元，九升小米。可是三个月每人支垫小米一石三斗（折洋二万六千多），麻油十斤（每斤一千二百元）折洋一万二千元，以上共开支大洋三万八千余元。加上九升小米，折洋二千元。恰恰不亏但也不赚，不过就是赶了个嘴，赚了一条路（窑路）。
