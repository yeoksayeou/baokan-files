Taihang News: According to reports from correspondents in Ping順 (Píngshùn), Licheng, Huguan, Lucheng, Huixian, Gaoyi and other counties, bad cadres and landlords and rich peasants in some villages have speculatively organized fake poor peasant leagues, attempting to gain the upper hand, suppress poor and hired peasants, deceive superiors, and undermine the democratic movement. According to reports and research, there are probably two types of fake poor peasant leagues: One is where bad cadres want to use fake poor peasant leagues as air-raid shelters to cover up their mistakes; this type is more common. Lu Tianshun, the village chief of Songjiazhuang in the fourth district of Lucheng, Wang Xiaonian, the chairman of the farmers' association, and Jin Fuqiu, the public security officer, falsely accused sixteen middle peasant households and six poor peasant households of being "special agents" last spring because they were settling personal grudges. They also struggled against nine middle peasant households and two poor peasant households, causing the masses in the whole village to be afraid to say anything, and any speech was dismissed as "special agents" spreading rumors. Now, in order to cover up their mistakes such as乱斗 (luàn dòu) [randomly struggling against people] and occupying excessive gains, and fearing that the masses will settle accounts with them when dividing the spoils, they first took the initiative to rope in wealthy middle peasants (whom they were afraid to struggle against) and other people to organize fake poor peasant leagues, threatening the poor and hired peasants who did not participate in the fake poor peasant leagues. On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month, a poor hired peasant, Pan Lan Nu, was beaten to death in a meeting for not having a road pass when going to her daughter's home; the suppressed poor and hired peasants dared not move. It was not until the fourth day of the first lunar month that the district authorities discovered this and detained the three bad cadres. Zhang Yan, a newly promoted district cadre in the fifth district of Huixian, after attending a meeting in the district to discuss the Outline Land Law, twice returned home and used private means to rope in people to organize a fake poor peasant league, arranging for Zhai Rong to be the head of the league, and distorting the provisions of the Land Law regarding the poor peasant league at a mass meeting; he said: "The head of the league has the greatest power. If he says an egg is black, no one dares to say it is white. Anyone who says it is white is breaking the law; everything in the village, regardless of men, women, old, or young, must be approved by the head of the league." The village carried on like this for half a month before the district authorities discovered it and disbanded the league. Some villages in Beiliutan in Ping順 (Píngshùn) and the fifth district of Huguan also discovered fake poor peasant leagues of the same type as above. The other type is where class dissidents take advantage of the poor and hired peasants' dissatisfaction with the cadres, and speculatively rope in people to organize fake poor peasant leagues, mainly attempting to seize leadership and ruin the cadres. Liang Lao Lü, a bad egg in Beidu of Gaoyi, organized a fake poor peasant league by taking the opportunity to rope in people who were dissatisfied with the cadres after his three landlord relatives were liquidated by the masses last year, and he hated the cadres. After the promulgation of the Land Law, he took the opportunity to rope in people who were dissatisfied with the cadres to organize a fake poor and hired peasant league, and reported the village cadres to the district authorities, attempting to overthrow the cadres and seize power in the village; he also threatened the masses who joined the fake poor peasant league to keep it secret. Later, after in-depth propaganda of the Land Law, the masses automatically exposed this conspiracy, disbanded the fake poor and hired peasant league, and sent Liang Lao Lü to the district authorities for handling. In Chongyan, first district of Ping順 (Píngshùn), it was also discovered that the bad cadre and cooperative director (former village chief) Yuan Dongfa privately roped in poor and hired peasants to organize a small group (of six or seven people), brewing to replace all the cadres; Yuan Dongfa came up with bad ideas, and the other six or seven people came forward to do it. The above two different types of fake poor and hired peasant leagues have the same nature and results in undermining the Land Law and suppressing poor and hired peasants from standing up. We must mobilize the masses to expose them.

　　太行不少村庄发现假贫农团
  　领导上应切实注意检查           
    两种类型
  　一种是坏干部操纵一种是坏分子把持
    【太行消息】据平顺、黎城、壶关、潞城、辉县、高邑等县通讯员报导，有些村庄的坏干部和地富分子，投机组织假贫农团，企图以先发制人来压住贫雇，欺哄上级，破坏民主、抽补运动。据报导研究，假贫农团大概有两种类型：一种是坏干部为掩盖自己错误，想以假贫农团当防空洞；这一类型比较多。潞城四区宋家庄村长路天顺、农会主席王小年、公安员靳富秋，因为去年春天曾以公报私仇，给十六户中农、六户贫农按上“特务”帽子，并斗了九户中农、两户贫农，致使全村群众不敢吭一声，一说话就说是“特务”造谣。现在他们为掩护乱斗和多占果实等错误，害怕群众平分时和他们算帐，即先下手拉拢富裕中农（他们怕斗）等组织假贫农团，威胁没参加假贫农团的贫雇。阴历腊月二十七日，贫雇潘兰女，因去他闺女家没开路条，即被开会打死，镇压的贫雇不敢动。直到正月初四区上发觉才把这三个坏干部扣起。辉县五区新提拔的区干部张彦，在区上开会讨论土地法大纲后，曾两次回家用私人拉拢办法组织假贫农团；布置让翟荣当团长，并在群众大会上曲解土地法中关于贫农团的规定；他说：“团长权力最大，他说鸡蛋是黑的，谁也不敢说是白的，谁说白的就是犯法；全村无论男女老少什么事情都得通过团长批准。”该村这样搞了半月，后来才被区上发觉解散。平顺北流滩和壶关五区有些村庄也发现和上述同类型的假贫农团。另一种是阶级异己分子利用贫雇对干部不满，投机拉拢组织假贫农团，主要企图是劫取领导权，搞垮干部。高邑北渎坏蛋梁老吕，因他本家三户地主去年都被群众清算，仇恨干部。土地法公布后，他便乘机拉拢对干部不满的人组织假贫雇团，向区上告村干，企图打垮干部，掌握村中大权；又威胁入假贫农团的群众要保守秘密。后来经过深入宣传土地法，群众自动揭露这一阴谋，解散假贫雇团，把梁老吕送到区上处理。平顺一区崇岩，亦发现坏干部合作社长（前任村长）原东发，私自拉拢贫雇，组织小集团（有六七个人），酝酿一律撤换干部；原东发出坏主意，其它六七个人出头干。上述两种不同类型的假贫雇团，其破坏土地法和压制贫雇不让翻身的本质和结果是一样的，都须发动群众揭发它。
