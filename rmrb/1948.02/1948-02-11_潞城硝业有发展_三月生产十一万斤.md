    Lucheng Saltpeter Industry Develops: 110,000 Jin Produced in Three Months
    [Lucheng News] Lucheng saltpeter workers are actively increasing production. The County Saltpeter Workers Committee responded to the County Party Committee's call to "Support the Front Lines, Workers Increase Work Efficiency," organized and led the saltpeter workshops to challenge Yongxing Coal Mine to increase production. Saltpeter workshops also challenged each other. It is planned that the county's sixty-three saltpeter workshops and seventy-five pots will produce more than 150,000 jin of saltpeter in four months (that is, an average of more than sixteen jin of saltpeter per pot per day), an increase of more than ninety jin per pot per month compared to usual. From the start of the competition to now, less than three months, more than 110,000 jin have been completed. The Huangniuti saltpeter workshop usually produces more than 500 jin of saltpeter per month, but in November it produced more than 800 jin, an increase of more than 300 jin compared to before. According to the County Saltpeter Workers' Union's estimate, the task of producing 150,000 jin of saltpeter in four months will definitely be completed. In the process of increasing production, the wages in rice of each worker have also increased by a quarter compared to before. In the past, each worker earned about 180 jin of rice per month, but now they earn more than 240 jin, so the enthusiasm of the saltpeter workers is very high. Comrade Xu Youwen of the Saltpeter Workers' Union proposed: We can get these benefits because the counter-offensive on the front line is victorious, and the rear can be very stable in production and get such gains. Each of our workers should take out some of the increased wages in rice to support the front line and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. The workers strongly supported this proposal and said: We must take advantage of the New Year to send out the funds to support the front line. According to preliminary statistics, workers' donations have reached 840,000 yuan. (Shen Huquan, ××)

    潞城硝业有发展
    三月生产十一万斤
    【潞城消息】潞城硝业工人积极增加生产。县硝工委员会响应县委“支援前线，工人增加工作效率”的号召，组织与领导硝坊向永兴煤矿提出增产挑战。硝坊与硝坊也互相挑战。计划全县六十三个硝坊、七十五口锅，在四个月要生产十五万余斤硝（即每口锅每日平均十六斤多硝），比平素每锅每月多增九十多斤。从竞赛日起，到现在还不够三个月，已完成了十一万多斤。黄牛蹄硝坊平素每月产硝五百余斤，十一月份生产了八百多斤，比较以前增加了三百来斤。据县硝工会估计，四个月产硝十五万斤的任务一定可以完成。在增加生产的过程中，每个工人的工资米也比较以前增加了四分之一。过去每个工人每月赚米一百八十来斤，现在赚到二百四十多斤，因此硝业工人的热情很高。硝工会徐有文同志提出：咱们能以得到这些利益是因为前方反攻胜利，后方才能够很安稳的搞生产，得到这样的收获。我们每个工人应把增产的工资米提出一些来，支援前方，早日打倒蒋介石。工人们非常拥护这个提议，都说：要乘着年关把支援前线的款子送出去。据初步统计，工人捐款已达八十四万元。（申虎全、××）
