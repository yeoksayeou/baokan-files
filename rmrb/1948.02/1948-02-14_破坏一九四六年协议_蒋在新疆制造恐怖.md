Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule over ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is becoming increasingly brutal. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the American News Agency on the 4th of this month, citing a protest letter from Ahmaedjan Qasimi and others to Zhang Zhizhong, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to implement a policy of terror and suppression in Xinjiang Province, has violated the 1946 agreement and greatly increased troops from 20,000 in the past to 80,000. This not only increased the burden on the people, but also "threatened Muslim masses and Muslim representatives at all levels of government, creating terror, indiscriminately arresting people, and subjecting them to torture and slaughter." Chiang Kai-shek also broke the agreement to abolish secret agents, instructing his Sanqing Tuan (Three Principles of the People Youth League) secret agents to wantonly arrest and kill people.

According to a confession from a Chiang Kai-shek CC Clique magazine in Shanghai, after Chiang Kai-shek appointed the reactionary feudal element Masud Sabri as the chairman of Xinjiang Province last May, "the political lineup in Dihua was immediately 'adjusted' by Masud Sabri and Isa Yusuf Alptekin (Secretary-General of Chiang Kai-shek's Xinjiang Provincial Government)." The Uyghur version of the Xinjiang Daily was also forcibly "taken over" by Isa Yusuf Alptekin and others. By means of disguised "popular elections," democratic figures in various prefectural and county governments were "cleared out." The "re-elections" of provincial and county councilors and county heads directed by Wu Mair, the commissioner of the Kashgar District in southern Xinjiang, and the sham elections in Dihua, Maralbexi, Aksu and other districts were all to achieve this goal. The magazine confessed: "In the mainland (other Chiang-controlled areas), there is no 'people' to speak of in popular elections, let alone in Xinjiang." After Masud Sabri seized power, corruption became even worse, and new currency was issued indiscriminately, causing prices to soar. By October of last year, the price of gold in Dihua had reached thirteen or fourteen times that of October the previous year.

    破坏一九四六年协议
    蒋在新疆制造恐怖
    【新华社陕北九日电】蒋匪对新疆少数民族之法西斯统治日见残暴。据美国通讯社本月四日上海电讯所引阿买合提江等致张治中之抗议书中透露：蒋匪为图在新省实行恐怖镇压政策，已违反一九四六年的协议，大量增兵，由过去之两万人增至八万人，不仅加重了人民负担，而且“威胁回教群众及各级政府机关的回教代表，制造恐怖，乱事捕人，施以酷刑和屠杀。”蒋匪又背弃取消特务的协议，指使其三青团特务分子，恣意捕杀人民。
    据蒋匪ＣＣ系的上海某杂志供认：蒋匪于去年五月委派反动封建分子麦斯武德充任新省省主席后，“迪化的政治阵容马上被麦斯武德与艾沙（蒋匪新疆省府秘书长）等‘调整’了。”新疆日报维文版亦被艾沙等强力“接收”。并以伪装“民选”手段，“清除”各专署及县府中的民主人士，其南疆喀什区专员吴迈尔所导演的“重新更选”省县参议员与县长，以及迪化、马耆、阿克苏等区的伪选，均为达到此一目的。该杂志供认：“在内地（其他蒋区）讲民选已无‘民’字可言，在新疆更谈不到‘民’字”。麦斯武德窃政后，贪污风气更甚，又滥发新币，物价猛涨，至去年十月，迪化黄金价格已达前年十月的十三、四倍。
