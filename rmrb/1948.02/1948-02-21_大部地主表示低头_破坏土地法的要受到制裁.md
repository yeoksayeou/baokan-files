　　Most Landlords Indicate Submission
　　Those Who Sabotage the Land Law Will Be Punished
    Some landlords and rich peasants, upon hearing that they would receive the same share of land as the peasants, were very grateful to the Chinese Communist Party for pointing out a new path for them to be reborn and start anew. They were especially grateful for the peasants' leniency towards them. This proves that it is very necessary for the Land Law to allocate a share to landlords, so that they can survive on the path of labor and production. But there are also those who resist the Land Law. For example, Sun Fengwu, a landlord in Sunjia Slope, Neiqiu, said to Sun Wucheng, a new middle peasant: "You see, those who have been struggled against are fine now, they are only talking about struggling against middle peasants!" Liu Bozhen, a rich peasant in Xiaoling, Neiqiu, ate a ton of mutton and white flour every day in a restaurant in Mengjiaping after the Land Law was promulgated. Similar things have happened in some counties in Southern Hebei and Taiyue. They gave wine and grain to win over cadres and poor and hired peasants; and even assassinated poor and hired peasants. In Han Tong's family in Xiaozicun, Neiqiu, a rich peasant, there were eight brothers who separated after hearing about the Land Law. (Originally, one person was a major cadre in the village, so he was not thoroughly struggled against.) He Quanhuai, a landlord in Anyao, Zuoquan, said: "Anyway, we can't survive, so eating is a real gain." He slaughtered a pig and the whole family ate it. These people's rumors, sabotage, and illegal acts of selling, transferring, and wasting property should be given a serious rebuttal and legal sanctions.
    In some places, there are also individual bad elements who, because of conflicts with other people in the village, attempt to win over some people and take this opportunity to retaliate. For example, Cheng Shouku, a veteran in Dongliu Village, Cixian County, incited other veterans and families of soldiers to oppose the cadres. After the Land Law Outline came to the village, he said to Cheng Huaide, a middle peasant, on the street: "There is a major land reform! If you are on my side, it will be fine." Such situations of distorting the Land Law in order to create sectarian disputes, win over people, and attack cadres should also be stopped, and they should be punished as sabotaging the Land Law.

### 大部地主表示低头　破坏土地法的要受到制裁

　　大部地主表示低头
　　破坏土地法的要受到制裁
    地主富农中有的听到要与农民分到同样一份土地，十分感谢中国共产党指给他们新生，重新做人的一条大道，他们尤其感激农民对他们的宽大。证明土地法上分给地主一份，使他们能在劳动生产的道路上活下去，是非常必要的。也还有的抵抗土地法。如内邱孙家坡地主孙凤梧到新中农孙五成家里说："你看被斗户以后没事了，光说斗中农吧！"内邱小岭的富农刘伯贞在土地法公布后，每天到孟家坪一个饭铺里吃一吨羊肉白面。冀南和太岳某些尤县份都有类似的事情发生。他们送酒送粮拉拢干部和贫雇；甚至暗杀贫雇农。内邱孝子村富农韩同家里弟兄八个，听到土地法后分了家。（原来有一个人当着村里主要干部，所以没斗透）左权安窑的地主何全换说："反正不能过了，吃了是实赚。"杀了一口猪全家吃了。对这些人的造谣破坏和变卖转移浪费财物的非法行为，应给以严正的驳斥和法律的制裁。
    还有些地方，有个别坏分子因为和村里另外一些人有矛盾，企图拉拢一些人，乘此机会报复。如磁县东六村荣誉军人程守库，挑动其他荣退军人和抗属反干部，土地法大纲到村后，他在街上给一个中农程怀德说："土地大改革哩！你如果跟我一股气，就不要紧了。"象这种为了闹宗派纠纷，拉拢人攻击干部而曲解土地法的情形，也应该注意制止，要按破坏土地法来制裁他们。
