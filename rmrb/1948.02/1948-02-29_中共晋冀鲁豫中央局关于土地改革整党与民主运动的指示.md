　　CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's Instructions on Land Reform, Party Rectification, and Democratic Movement
(I) Based on the land reform situation in our region, it can be divided into three types of areas: The first type of area is where landlords and old rich peasants have been thoroughly eliminated, and the vast majority of poor and hired peasants have completely turned over (accounting for more than 80% of their own class). Land has long been equally distributed, that is, the Land Law Outline has actually been largely realized. In this type of area, new and old middle peasants account for more than 80% of the total number of households in the village. Because the poor and hired peasants here generally turned over earlier and more thoroughly, they have accumulated more wealth, and their political and class consciousness is also higher. The poor and hired peasants who have not completely turned over only account for a very small number, and they have also received the fruits of land reform, but they are not very satisfied and need a little supplementation. This type of area is the best working area in our region, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total population of the region. The second type of area is where landlords and old rich peasants have also been largely overthrown, and land has also been largely equally distributed. The degree of turnover of poor and hired peasants is slightly less than that of the first type of area, with about 60% to 70% of their own class having already turned over. However, because they have not turned over for long, they have little accumulation, and their political and class consciousness is also relatively poor. In this type of area, new and old middle peasants account for about 60% to 70% of the total number of households in the village, and poor and hired peasants who have not completely turned over or have not turned over also account for a minority. This type of area is a medium working area in our region, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the total population of the region. The third type of area is where, although mass movements have been carried out, they are scattered, unsystematic, and of short duration, so landlords and old rich peasants have not been thoroughly overthrown, and most of the poor and hired peasants have not completely turned over or have not turned over, and the land problem has not been fundamentally resolved. This type of area is a weak working area in our region, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total population of the region.

　　In the first two types of areas, the degree of thoroughness of land reform is not much different, that is, they have largely achieved equal distribution. The main remaining problems are: some cadres and party members have protected landlords and rich peasants who have not been thoroughly overthrown, some military cadres and families of revolutionary martyrs who are landlords and rich peasants have retained more land and property, and non-landlord and rich peasant military cadres and families of revolutionary martyrs have been given more land and property, and many cadres have occupied more land and property. If this specific situation is disregarded, and only land problems are circled, and another equal distribution movement is carried out, not only will a fervent mass movement not be launched, but also left-leaning errors will inevitably occur (such as forcibly squeezing feudal elements, not leaving landlords with a living, only leaving rich peasants with bad land, randomly attacking middle peasants, touching the floating wealth of wealthy middle peasants, infringing on industry and commerce, etc.). Therefore, in the first two types of areas, there should be no more equal distribution movement. Measures such as drawing from the surplus to compensate for the deficit, drawing from the fat to compensate for the lean, filling in the gaps, and moving a few without moving the majority can be taken to solve the remaining land problems. Moreover, the filling and supplementation should be combined with party rectification and the establishment of a people's congress democratic movement from the village to the county level, and non-party poor and hired peasants and middle peasants can be absorbed to participate in the party branch meetings, so that the party branch meetings and mass meetings are combined into one, in order to make the party branch public, and conduct class investigation, ideological investigation, position investigation, work style investigation, and behavior investigation, and handle bad cadres and bad party members under the opinions of the masses to complete the party rectification task. In this kind of meeting, the combination of party rectification and supplementation with the democratic movement (actually rectifying the landlord and rich peasant elements within the party and the landlord and rich peasant ideology and its influence) combines the internal solution of the party with the mass solution, and the internal criticism of the party with the pressure of the masses. Because the democratic movement of party rectification in the old areas is an inseparable matter from eliminating feudal remnants, and the democratic movement has a broader mass base, leaving this base or mechanically stipulating that land reform should be carried out first and then democracy cannot have a broad mass movement.

　　Regarding organizational forms, in the first type of area, do not organize poor peasant leagues and poor peasant groups, or only organize poor peasant groups in the peasant associations to protect the interests of the few poor and hired peasants who have not yet completely turned over. If a very small number of poor and hired peasants (and most of them are old, weak, and honest) are forcibly organized into poor peasant leagues to act as the core backbone and play the role of leading everything, it is very difficult and there is a risk of offending the middle peasants. Therefore, this type of area should only organize peasant associations and skillfully and fully utilize the form of peasant representative conferences. However, in the peasant association committees, peasant representative conferences, and village (township) governments, as well as in the process of the democratic movement for party rectification, it should be ensured that two-thirds of the poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants participate, and old middle peasants should not exceed one-third. In the second type of area, poor peasant leagues can be organized, composed of poor and hired peasants who have not turned over and have not completely turned over, and new middle peasant groups (⑴⑵) are absorbed to protect and represent their interests. At the same time, it should be ensured that poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants account for two-thirds in the peasant association committees, peasant representative conferences, and village (township) governments, and old middle peasants should not exceed one-third. In the third type of area, the Land Law Outline can be fully followed, and poor peasant leagues can be organized to play the role of leading everything. However, it is necessary to pay great attention to uniting the middle peasants, and no adventurous policies should be taken towards the middle peasants.

　　(II) When classifying classes, all localities generally err on the side of excessive leftism in determining the targets of struggle. Class investigation should not be based on the few years before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, but should trace back three generations (it is permissible to ask about the father and grandfather when examining the ideology of cadres who have left production). If the person himself started engaging in main labor until now in the few years before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, it is wrong to still classify him as a landlord or rich peasant. It is also wrong to classify intellectuals who engage in mental labor without relying on feudal exploitation as landlords or rich peasants. Or it is wrong to put on the hat of landlord or rich peasant based on the person's poor political attitude, chaotic sexual relations, or problems with work style; or it is even more wrong to deliberately expand the scope of struggle and deliberately classify middle peasants as rich peasants, or even landlords, in order to distribute more floating wealth. In the future, when classifying classes and determining components, we can only use the standards of whether each person possesses the means of production, how much they possess, and the production relations (exploitative relations) associated with possession. There can be no other standards (such as so-called political attitude, whether life is affluent, whether work style is good or bad, etc.). Regarding the issue of component transformation, if a landlord has already transferred to labor or other components for one year before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, or has already transferred to labor or other components for five years after the establishment of a democratic government in the local area; if an old rich peasant has already transformed into other components for one year before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, or has already transformed into other components for three years after the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, their components should be changed according to their transformed situation. There should be a distinction between landlords and rich peasants. Landlords do not labor or do not participate in main labor, while rich peasants participate in main labor. There should be a distinction between rich peasants and wealthy middle peasants. Those whose income from exploitation accounts for more than 25% of their total income are rich peasants, and those whose income from exploitation accounts for less than 25% are wealthy middle peasants. Those wealthy middle peasants who have minor exploitation (such as partnering with others to hire sheep workers, cattle workers, hire short-term workers, or lend a small amount of debt, etc.) should still be counted as wealthy middle peasants, but not as rich peasants. Therefore, when classifying classes, it is necessary to effectively prevent and overcome left-leaning errors, and it is necessary to listen to the opinions of the masses as much as possible, and adopt the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three-way finalization. Not only must it be discussed and passed by the poor peasant league, but it must also be discussed and passed by the peasant association, and finally passed by the village representative assembly. In order to achieve fairness, reasonableness, and everyone's approval.

　　(III) After the cadre conference of the entire region, various localities have a wrong understanding of relying on poor and hired peasants to unite middle peasants. When emphasizing the poor and hired peasant line, the phenomenon of blindly advocating poor and hired peasants has occurred. In the future, the term "poor and hired peasant line" should no longer be used, because it is very likely to relax the unity of middle peasants and isolate poor and hired peasants. It will confuse the mass line with the poor and hired peasant line. The mass line is the class line, which is specifically manifested in relying on poor and hired peasants to unite middle peasants and all anti-feudal elements. When establishing people's congresses at all levels, it is necessary to unite all anti-feudal elements, because the nature of the new democratic government is not only to represent the peasants, let alone only to represent the poor and hired peasants, but to represent all working people (workers, peasants, independent industrialists and merchants, intellectuals engaged in mental labor, etc.) and the petty bourgeoisie (middle bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie), as well as enlightened gentry, etc. The poor peasant league must obtain the consent of the middle peasants in doing things, not formal consent, but real consent. Therefore, the poor peasant league must make concessions to the middle peasants on certain issues. When Chairman Mao talked about the two basic principles of land reform in "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," he pointed out: "First, we must satisfy the demands of the poor and hired peasants. This is the most basic task of land reform. Second, we must resolutely unite the middle peasants and not harm the interests of the middle peasants." and the five specific policies for uniting the middle peasants must be carefully studied and implemented without compromise.

　　(IV) It is successful to emphasize criticism and self-criticism after the conference, for example, in the past, we did not listen to the opinions of poor and hired peasants enough, and now we have corrected it to listen to the opinions of poor and hired peasants, which is good. However, the "Keri Kong" phenomenon of blindly advocating poor and hired peasants has arisen, and tailism that violates Marxism-Leninism and abandons leadership has occurred. We only blindly worship and approve the poor and hired peasants, do not criticize their mistakes, and completely abandon the leadership of the Party. This shows that many comrades have weakness and lack of principle, and dare not uphold the truth. In the past, various regions have made similar mistakes, such as emphasizing the release of the masses and not pouring cold water, which is undoubtedly completely correct, but when the movement made left-leaning killing mistakes, they still adhered to the attitude of never correcting deviations, causing the movement to fall into a state of anarchy, unorganization, unplanned, undisciplined, completely made the tail of backward thoughts, and we suffered a great loss (such as in some areas of northern Henan and southern Shanxi). It should be known that the opinions of the peasant masses are relatively simple, relatively simple, relatively vivid, relatively original, and relatively one-sided. The task of the Party is to both learn from the masses and improve the masses. For example, it has recently been discovered that the peasants disagree with us on several issues: (A) In order to distribute more land and floating wealth, they deliberately increase the components of others; (B) They disagree with the same share of land being distributed to landlords; (C) They want to attack the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants; (D) They want to move the floating wealth of middle peasants, do not give middle peasants production loans, forcibly borrow middle peasants' livestock and vehicles for production, and increase the burden on middle peasants, etc. For the fundamental and long-term interests of the peasant masses, we cannot compromise on these four issues, and we must educate and persuade the peasants not to do so.

　　(V) Since this filling movement is carried out in conjunction with party rectification and the democratic movement, we lack experience in this regard. Also, since the task of land reform and party rectification cannot be completed before the spring plowing (strive to complete it but it is impossible), if it is universally launched, it will inevitably delay the spring plowing and will not be thorough, which will be harmful to future work. We are considering taking the method of focused advancement before the spring plowing. Each prefecture committee area only selects one or two counties, concentrates all the strength of the prefecture committee area to take a breakthrough point to obtain experience, educate the masses, educate the cadres, popularize the overall situation, and develop in a wave-like manner, so that the filling, party rectification, and democracy can be done well. Create experience, and then fully launch the movement after the spring plowing. The advantage of this method is that it can create experience, make fewer mistakes, and will not delay spring plowing. It can also solve the difficulty of the lack of cadres caused by the reorganization of the troops.

　　中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于土地改革整党与民主运动的指示
    （一）根据我区土地改革情况，可分为三类地区：第一类地区，地主与旧富农已经彻底消灭，贫雇农绝大部分已经彻底翻身（占其本阶层百分之八十以上），土地早已平分，即实际上早已大体实现了土地法大纲，这类地区新老中农合计占全村户数百分之八十以上，因为这里的贫雇一般翻身较早与彻底，所以积蓄较多，政治觉悟与阶级觉悟亦较高，没有彻底翻身的贫雇农，只占极少数，也分得了土地改革的果实，但尚不十分满意，需稍加填补。这类地区是我区工作最好的区域，约占全区人口三分之一弱。第二类地区，地主旧富农大体上亦已斗彻底，土地亦大体平分过，贫雇农翻身程度稍逊于第一类地区，已经翻身者约占其本阶层的百分之六十到七十。但因其翻身不久，故积蓄不多，政治觉悟与阶级觉悟亦较差。这类地区新老中农合计约占全村户数百分之六十到百分之七十，未彻底翻身与未翻身的贫雇农亦占少数。这类地区在我区工作是中等区域，约占全区人口三分之一强。第三类地区，虽也经过群众运动，但因是零星的，不系统的，时间较短的，所以地主与旧富农未斗彻底，贫雇农大部未彻底翻身或未翻身，土地问题基本上没有解决。这类地区是我区工作薄弱的区域，约占全区人口三分之一弱。
    在前两类地区中，土地改革的彻底程度相差无几，即大体上均已实现了平分，主要遗留下的问题是：有些干部党员所包庇的地主富农没有斗彻底，有些地主富农成份的军干烈属多留土地财物，与非地主富农之军干烈属多分土地财物，以及不少干部多占土地财物。如不顾这一具体情况，只在土地问题上打圈子，再来一次平分运动，不但发动不起热烈的群众运动，而且一定会发生左倾错误（如硬挤封建，不给地主留生活，只给富农留坏地，乱斗中农，动富裕中农的浮财，侵犯工商业等）。因此，在前两类地区中，不应再来一次平分运动，可采取抽多补少，抽肥补瘦，填平补齐，动少数不动多数的办法，以解决遗留下的土地问题，而且应将填补与整党及建立从村到县的人民代表大会的民主运动结合进行，并可吸收非党员的贫雇农与中农参加党的支部大会，使党的支部大会与群众大会结合为一，借以公开党的支部，并进行查阶级、查思想、查立场、查作风与查行为，在群众意见下处理坏干部坏党员，完成整党任务。在这种大会上，把整党填补与民主运动（实际是整党内的地主富农分子与地主富农思想及其影响）结合起来，把党内解决与群众解决、党内批评与群众压力结合起来。因为老区整党的民主运动与肃清封建残余是不可分离的一件事，而民主运动则有更广大的群众基础，离开这个基础或机械的规定先进行土改，后进行民主，都不能有广泛的群众运动。
    关于组织形式，在第一类地区，不组织贫农团与贫农小组，或只在农会中组织贫农小组，以保护少数尚未彻底翻身的贫雇农的利益。如硬要把十分少数的贫雇农（且多系老弱老实者）组织成贫农团来作核心骨干，起领导一切的作用，则十分勉强，且有冒犯中农的危险。所以这类地区应只组织农会，并熟练的充分的运用农民代表会的方式。但在农会委员会，农民代表会与村（乡）政府中以及在整党的民主运动过程中，应保证有三分之二的贫雇农和新中农参加，旧中农不得超过三分之一。在第二类地区，可组织贫农团，由未翻身与未彻底翻身之贫雇农并吸收新中农组（⑴⑵）成之，保护并代表他们的利益。同时应保证在农会委员会、农民代表会与村（乡）政府中，贫雇农与新中农共占三分之二，旧中农不得超过三分之一。在第三类地区，可完全按照土地法大纲进行，并组织贫农团起领导一切的作用。但必须十分注意团结中农，绝不许对中农采取任何冒险政策。
    （二）各地在划阶级时，首先在确定斗争对象上一般失之过左。查阶级不是以当地有民主政权前几年为准，而是追三代（在审查脱离生产干部的思想时，追问其父亲及其祖父是可以的），如其本人在当地有民主政权前几年，即开始从事主要劳动至现在者，仍划为地主富农是错误的。将从事脑力劳动，而不依靠封建剥削的知识分子划为地主富农，也是错误的。或根据其本人政治态度不好，或两性关系太乱，或作风有毛病，就给戴上地主富农帽子，也是不对的；或为多分浮财，便故意扩大斗争面，故意将中农划为富农，甚至地主，则更是错误的。今后划阶级确定成份时只能按照各人占有生产手段与否？占有多少及与占有关系相连带的生产关系（剥削关系）为标准，再不能有任何其他的标准（如所谓政治态度如何，生活富裕与否，作风好坏等）。关于成份转化问题，地主在当地民主政权成立以前，已经转入劳动，或其他成份满一年者，或在当地民主政权成立以后，已经转入劳动或其他成份满五年者；旧富农在当地民主政权成立以前已经转变为其他成份满一年者，或在当地民主政权成立以后已经转变为其他成份满三年者，应依其转变后的情况，改变其成份。地主与富农要有区别，地主是不劳动，或不参加主要劳动，富农是参加主要劳动的。富农与富裕中农要有区别，靠剥削收入的部分，占其总收入百分之二十五以上者为富农，百分之二十五以下者为富裕中农。富裕中农中有较轻微剥削者（如与别人合伙请羊工、牛工、雇短工或放少数债等），仍应算做富裕中农，而不能算做富农。因此，在划阶级时，必须切实防止与克服左倾错误，必须多多听取群众意见，采取自报公议三傍定案的办法，不仅要经过贫农团讨论通过，而且必须经过农会讨论通过，并最后经过村民大会通过。以便达到公平合理，大家赞成。
    （三）全区干部大会后，各地对依靠贫雇农团结中农有错误了解，强调贫雇路线时，发生盲目鼓吹贫雇农的现象，今后可再不用贫雇路线的字眼，因它很可能放松对中农的团结，使贫雇农孤立，它会把群众路线混同于贫雇路线。群众路线即阶级路线，具体表现在依靠贫雇农团结中农及一切反封建分子上。在建立各级人民代表大会时，要联合一切反封建分子，因为新民主主义政权性质，不只是代表农民，更不只是代表贫雇农，而是代表一切劳动群众（工人、农民、独立工商业者、脑力劳的知识分子等）与中小资产阶级（中等资产阶级、小资产阶级）以及开明士绅等。贫农团办事一定要取得中农同意，不是形式的，而是真正的同意，因此贫农团在某些问题上必须向中农让步。毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中讲到土改的两条基本原则时指出：“第一，必须满足贫农与雇农的要求，这是土地改革的最基本的任务。第二，必须坚决团结中农，不要损害中农利益”以及团结中农的五项具体政策必须仔细研究，不折不扣的付诸实行。
    （四）大会后强调批评与自我批评是有成绩的，比如过去倾听贫雇农的意见不够，现在改正过来，要倾听贫雇农的意见，这是好的。但又产生盲目鼓吹贫雇农的“客里空”现象，而发生了违背马列、放弃领导的尾巴主义。对贫雇农只是盲目崇拜批准，对其错误不加批评，完全放弃党的领导。这说明许多同志有软弱病，缺乏原则性，不敢坚持真理。过去各区曾经犯过这一类似的错误，如强调放手发动群众，不泼冷水，这无疑的是完全正确的，但当运动发生了左倾杀人错误时，仍抱定决不纠偏的态度，使运动陷入无政府状态，无组织、无计划、无纪律、完全作了落后思想的尾巴，使我们吃了很大的亏（如豫北和晋南某些地区）。须知农民群众的意见是比较朴素、比较简单、比较生动、比较原始、比较片面的，党的任务是既要向群众学习，同时还要提高群众。比如最近发现农民在几个问题上与我们不一致：（甲）为了想多分土地浮财故意提高别人成份；（乙）对地主分同样一份土地不同意；（丙）要斗地主富农的工商业；（丁）要动中农的浮财，不给中农生产贷款，强借中农牲口车辆生产，加重中农负担等。这四个问题，为了农民群众的根本利益，长远利益，我们就不能与之妥协，就必须教育说服农民不要这样做。
    （五）由于此次填补运动系与整党和民主运动结合进行，我们在这方面还缺乏经验，又由于春耕前土改与整党任务不可能完成（力争完成但不可能），如果普遍发动，势必耽误春耕，且搞不彻底，对以后工作反而有害。我们考虑在春耕前，只采取有重点的推进办法，每个地委区只选择一两个县，集中该地委区的一切力量采取突破一点取得经验，教育群众，教育干部，普及全面，波浪式的发展办法，以便将填补整党与民主都做好。创造经验，待春耕后再全面开展运动。这种办法的好处，是既可以创造经验，少犯错误，又不至耽误春耕。并可以解决因整编队伍而造成的干部缺乏的困难。
