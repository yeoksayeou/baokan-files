    Logistical Regiment Sends Personnel to Xiangshan
    To Rectify and Inspect Mass Discipline

    To the Editor:
    We received the original draft that you published in the newspaper about our situation (referring to "Criticism and Suggestions" published on page one on February 5th: Villagers in Xiangshan Village, Ci County, raise concerns and request the Logistical Regiment to inspect mass discipline). We immediately read the newspaper aloud to all villagers at the winter school. Everything you answered was explained to the masses, and they were all very happy. They said that now they can get a response in the newspaper for anything that happens, and they all felt very good about it.

    The responsible comrade of the Logistical Regiment also saw this news. They were anxious and angry, feeling that their leadership's education was insufficient. At the same time, they placed Xu Qianzhi under confinement. And dispatched Comrade Li from She County, traveling one hundred and sixty *li* in one day, to investigate Xu's problem in our village. He carried a polite letter from the regiment and company, writing that Comrade Xu Qianzhi had been placed under confinement and was preparing to be punished with hard labor. At that time, Comrade Li immediately talked with the village cadres about the process of Xu's issues. We told Comrade Li all of Xu's problems, and Comrade Li collected all the materials. Finally, Li talked a lot about Xu's mistakes in a polite manner, and told us about the discipline of the troops. Li made up for the grass money that Xu had shorted, according to the market price, a total of 10,630 yuan. He also insisted on paying the rental price for twenty quilts. However, in our minds, the People's Liberation Army is a team that serves the people, shedding blood and sweat to fight Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. If we took the quilt money, it would be unreasonable, so we firmly refused to accept it. After Comrade Li left, we explained everything Li talked about to the masses, and the masses felt that this was truly our people's army.

    辎重团派人到香山
    整顿检查群众纪律
    编辑同志：
    我们收到报上所登载着我们去的原稿（指二月五日一版所登“批评与建议”：磁县香山村群众提意见，请辎重团检查群众纪律），当时就在冬学向全村群众把报念了一遍，您们回答的一切都给群众解释了，群众都很高兴。说现在有啥事就能给报纸上答，都感觉很好。
    辎重团负责同志也看到了这个消息，他们着急愤恨，感到自己领导上教育不够，同时将许阡芝禁闭起了。并派李同志从涉县城出发，一天的光景，赶了一百六十里路，来在我村调查许的问题。携带团连的客气信，内写着许阡芝同志被禁闭起，并准备罚苦工。当时李同志不歇气的马上就和村干部谈许的经过情形，我们将许的问题都告给李同志，所有的材料李同志都搜集起来。最后李将许的错误谈了许多客气话，又将队伍上的纪律告给我们。许少给的草钱，李按市数补够，共一○六三○元。还非给被子二十条的赁价不行。但我们思想上解放军是为人民服务的队伍，流血流汗打蒋匪，如要了被子钱，是不合理的，所以我们坚决不收。李同志走后，我们将李来此谈的一切给群众解释了一下，群众感到这才真正是咱老百姓的队伍。
