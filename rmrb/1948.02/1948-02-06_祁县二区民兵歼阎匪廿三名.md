    Qixian Second District Militia Eliminates 23 Yan Bandits
    [Qixian News] The cadres and militia of the Five Villages Joint and Five Harmony Villages in the Second District created a model battle record of zero casualties versus twenty-three enemy deaths, and the County Military Committee issued a commendation. On the 15th of this month, the Yan Army's 45th and 46th Divisions, in coordination with the 37th Division stationed in Qixian, launched a county-wide "great flood" against us, attempting to carry out a brutal plunder and encircle our battalion. Our militia discovered this, bravely broke out of the encirclement, and spontaneously assisted the battalion in escaping danger, preventing the enemy from attacking, covering the retreat of the masses, and killing or wounding 23 enemy soldiers including a company commander. In this glorious victory, we suffered no casualties.
