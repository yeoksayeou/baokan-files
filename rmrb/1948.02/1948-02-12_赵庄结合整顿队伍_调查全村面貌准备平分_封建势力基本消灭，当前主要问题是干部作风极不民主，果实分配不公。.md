[Report from this newspaper] Systematically and thoroughly understanding the situation of a village is not easy. In the past, investigation work often relied on cadres and activists, and the materials obtained, though seemingly systematic, were often largely untrue. Recently, some cadres in Wu'an Zhao Village visited poor peasants and hired laborers and obtained some materials from casual conversations. This is not comprehensive or specific enough. From the perspective of seriously using class methods to understand a village's situation, this is only a preliminary attempt; however, it has revealed the basic situation of the village. The basic situation is that although landlords have been basically defeated, cadres and activists are replacing the masses, the work style is extremely bad, and the distribution of fruits is unfair. The preliminary results of the investigation are reported as follows:

Zhao Village is a large village in the Ninth District of Wu'an, reportedly with good work and few problems. The whole village has 688 households, 2,108 people, and over 7,700 mu of land. Before the War of Resistance, land was highly concentrated, and the number of poor peasants and hired laborers was very large. The landless and land-poor had three ways out: first, working in flour mills (there were many flour mills in the village); second, going to the Northeast to sell their labor (carrying water, going down coal mines); and third, working as farmhands in this village or other villages.

The old rulers were the Jin family's two brothers (Jin Gaokui, Jin Gaorui), who were landlords and store owners, with the Yongmaode and Yongmaoxiang commercial firms. Villagers often called these two commercial firms to refer to the two people by name. They, along with Zhao Wenhua, Zhao Quanming, Li Qingwang, Zhao Shunxing and smaller leaders, used the shrine and Baojia system to control the whole village. In addition, there was a larger landlord named Zhao Shunfa, who once had 1,400 mu of land and also had stores in Yangyi, but most of his land and commercial firms were not in this village, so he was not very interested in village power (during rent reduction and debt clearing, his properties were calculated by various villages).

In the autumn of 1937, when the Japanese invaders occupied the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang's defeated troops fled into the Taihang Mountains (all using the designation of the 53rd Army). The old order was in chaos (in Wu'an County alone, there were eighteen miscellaneous commanders at the same time). The village also suffered greatly, and the villagers' movable property (including landlords and rich peasants) suffered great losses. Later, the Japanese invaders and Zhu Huaibing's troops came to harass the village from time to time, until 1941 (one year after Zhu Huaibing was eliminated) when our public regime began to exist.

Before our regime was made public (the year is unknown), our Party and armed forces were already active. The village also organized the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, guerrilla groups, and a Party branch. However, this branch was dissolved because it collectively accepted bribes from landlords (only one Party member named Jin Deyuan was retained, who is now working in the Political Department of the Military Region). When reorganizing after the dissolution, a cautious attitude was adopted, and development was very slow. At the beginning, there were only six people: Jin Mantun (deceased), Li Sugen (deceased), Tian Dongfang, Yang Zhankui, Zhao Xi, and Jin Deyuan. Soon, two former Party members who had been suspended (Jin Caiyuan, Li Bugui) were also absorbed, making a total of eight people.

On the eighth day of the fourth lunar month of 1941, when the enemy came to sweep the village, everyone fled, and the Jin family's two brothers and all the old rulers organized a maintenance association, bared their fangs and claws, and slaughtered pigs to entertain guests. The Party, the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, and the guerrilla groups were ordered to wipe out their gang and send them to the Wu'an West County Government. From then on, their open political forces were basically defeated. Although they still had activities afterward, they dared not show their faces publicly.

Before the rent reduction and interest reduction in 1942, a village-wide self-reporting of grain and deposits was launched to solve the burden problem. The landlords felt the increasing pressure and sold off inferior land in large quantities in an attempt to change their class status. Some land was acquired by the landless and land-poor. In the same year, when rent reduction and debt clearing began, people who had rental relationships with landlords also obtained some land and grain, and the landlord class was greatly weakened economically. However, because the area was too close to the enemy, the traitorous forces still colluded with the landlords in the village and established three or four kinds of gangs and superstitious groups to confuse the masses. Soon (more than a year later), we successively cracked them down.

At that time, the implementation of the United Front policy was a little too rightist, and the landlords were still able to use legal protection to hide themselves. Jin Yaohua, the son of Jin Gaorui (Yongmaoxiang), was the principal of a senior primary school in the county. During the rent reduction and debt clearing, he engaged in open reasoning struggles with the masses, and the masses could do nothing about it. Primary school teachers Liu ×× and Zhang Ganzhou established an education association in the village to secretly develop Kuomintang organizations in order to support the latent forces of the landlords in the village.

In the great famine of 1943, many middle peasants and below fled and scattered, and many young adults went to the Northeast, and many died abroad or their whereabouts were unknown, and some starved to death at home. At this time, although the government issued relief grain, the village cadres were undemocratic, a few people exercised dictatorship, and the poor and powerless could not receive it, while the cooperative (the grain distribution agency) and its relevant personnel could all eat and drink freely. After the famine, it took one or two years for the people who fled to slowly return. The work in the village improved a little after the people who made mistakes in the famine relief work (Jin Caiyuan, etc.) were punished and replaced (not thoroughly). Later, after a review and settlement of accounts according to the problems, and an equal distribution of the fruits, the masses received some additional compensation.

From the beginning of the work until before the May 4th Directive, the work in the village was only about the single-handed cadres fighting with the landlords. After defeating the landlords' advantage, they learned their work style to rule over other masses. Although the district-level officials made corrections, the corrections were not thorough. Several old Party members and old cadres have not changed much even now.

After the May 4th Directive, the village has carried out four or five struggles (including the anti-spy struggle), each more intense than the last. It was not until the last one in the autumn of last year that the old nest of feudal forces was basically wiped out. However, the landlords who were relatives and friends of the cadres were still not thoroughly struggled against. In terms of the new forces, the number of Party members has increased to 47 (now there are 39 left after those who have joined the army or left for other reasons), and there are also 40 or 50 activists (non-cadre Party members), who are the team that executes the May 4th Directive (the majority of whom are poor peasants and hired laborers).

These people have long formed an opposition to the landlords in history, so they are active in confiscating land and floating wealth, but in the last one or two times, they expanded the scope of the struggle and mistakenly expanded the rich peasants into the targets of the struggle. The reason for this has not yet been clearly studied, it may be in order to increase the fruits, or it may be political hatred.

In terms of the distribution of fruits, the principle is to fill the gaps and make up for deficiencies, but in fact the land has achieved the form of filling the gaps (each person should produce more than five dan of grain), but in essence there are still differences: (1) Cadres generally have high yields. Zhao Hengshu, a member of the Peasants' Association, has nine mu of good nearby land, with a yield of more than twenty dan. (2) Families of revolutionary soldiers are generally taken care of excessively, and are given more good land near the village. Zhao Hengyi's family of six has 37.5 mu of land, with a yield of more than 11 dan per person, mostly good nearby land. (3) Non-cadre activists and non-revolutionary soldiers' families get land of poor quality and large acreage. Although they have the same yield, the loss of work is great, and there are still deficits. Jin Tingquan has nine mu of land, which is far and bad, and he can't even exchange it for two mu of someone else's land. According to the statistics of three villages (25 villages in the whole village), among the 77 households, 37 are still deficit households. The situation is roughly the same as above. (4) The so-called average yield is the lowest number, and the highest number is almost unlimited. Some of the floating wealth is still in the hands of the Peasants' Association, and the distributed floating wealth is also not very fair: (1) Cadres and revolutionary soldiers' families get more good houses. (2) The livestock, farm tools, furniture, clothes, etc. obtained by revolutionary soldiers' families are more than those of ordinary people.

In terms of work style, cadres and activists completely replaced the masses. Almost all the things like detaining targets, confiscating family property, and distributing fruits were done by these hundred or so people. Other masses only watched the excitement at the general meeting, and sometimes raised their fists. Some masses, on the one hand, received the fruits, on the other hand, still pitied the landlords, or did not interfere in politics at all.

Relationship between cadres and the masses: The village cadres' work style is undemocratic. In general, their attitude towards the masses is not good, and they often play tricks. The masses are afraid of them and dare not speak, which has led to the unfair distribution of fruits. Many honest poor peasants and hired laborers have not yet completely turned themselves around and hate the cadres. In the middle-peasant area, because the cadres struggled against many rich peasants to avoid returning the fruits themselves, there is also a fairly common sense of dissatisfaction. In addition, there is a small faction of retired soldiers in the village who often find excuses to provoke dissatisfaction in order to compete with the cadres for power and profit, which has led to the deterioration of the relationship between cadres and the masses. During the summer of 1947, when the cadres were washing their faces and wiping off the blackness, the retired soldiers and the middle peasants used the poor peasants' dissatisfaction to launch an anti-cadre wave. The superiors supported both sides, and began to praise the cadres after the masses raised a few opinions, as a result, the cadres' faces were not washed clean, but instead the masses were attacked, and the cadres took the opportunity to retaliate against the leading elements. At this point, the surface was calm, and no one spoke, but the estrangement was deeper. The masses hated the cadres more than they hated the landlords. In the past, the leaders were deceived by the surface phenomena and felt that there were not many problems in Zhao Village. From the current understanding, there are quite a few problems. A comprehensive understanding is still needed in the subsequent land redistribution movement.

    赵庄结合整顿队伍
    调查全村面貌准备平分
    封建势力基本消灭，当前主要问题是干部作风极不民主，果实分配不公。
    【本报消息】系统的周密的了解一个村的情况，是一件很不容易的事。过去调查工作上常常依靠干部积极分子，所得材料，形式上看很系统，但实际上常常很多不真实。最近有些干部在武安赵庄村访问贫雇，从漫谈中获得一些材料，还不够全面具体，从认真运用阶级方法了解一个村的情况看，还只是一个尝试；但已发现该村基本的情况，存在着地主基本上虽被打垮，但干部积极分子代替群众，作风极坏，果实分配不公等问题。现将调查的初步结果，报导如下：
    赵庄是武安九区一个大村，据说工作较好，问题较少。全村有六百八十八户，两千一百零八口人，七千七百余亩土地。抗战前土地相当集中，贫雇数量很大。无地少地的人有三种出路：第一是粉坊工人（本村粉坊甚多），第二是赴东北出卖苦力（担水、下煤窑），第三是在本村或外村当长工。
    旧统治者有靳家二弟兄（靳高魁、靳高瑞）、是地主兼商店东家，有永茂德、永茂祥两座商号。村人常呼这两座商号的名字代替他两个人的名字。他两人和赵文会、赵全明、李清旺、赵顺兴较小的头子们，借神社和保甲制度来控制全村。此外尚有一个较大的地主名赵顺法，曾有过一千四百亩土地，也有商店开设在阳邑，不过他的土地和商号大部分不在本村，所以对村政权兴趣不高（减租清债时，其产业为各村算去）。
    一九三七年秋，日寇攻占平汉线，国民党的各路溃兵逃入太行山（均用五十三军之号），旧秩序大乱（只武安一县即同时有十八个杂牌司令），本村亦大受骚扰，村民动产（连地主富农在内）损失甚大。后来日寇与朱怀冰部队时来打搅，直至四一年（消灭了朱怀冰后一年）才开始有我方之公开政权。
    在我政权未公开前（年代不详），即有我党及武装活动，本村也组织过青抗先、游击小组和党的支部。惟这个支部曾因集体受了地主之贿而被解散（仅保留了一个党员名靳得元，现在军区政治部工作）。解散后重新组织时即抱慎重态度，发展甚慢，开始仅靳满囤（已死）、李宿根（已死）、田东方、杨占魁、赵锡、靳得元等六人，不久又吸收了前被停止党籍者二人（靳才垣、李步贵）共八人。
    四一年阴历四月初八日，敌来扫荡，全村人逃亡一空，靳家二弟兄和全部旧统治者们组织维持会，张牙舞爪，杀猪请客。党及青抗先、游击小组，受命将他们一伙人一网打尽，送交武西县政府，自此他们的公开政治势力才算基本上垮台，以后虽仍有活动，却不敢公然露面了。
    四二年减租减息前，因负担问题发动过一次全村自报存粮存款，地主们感到压力渐增，即大量变卖劣地，企图改变成份，无地少地的人取得一部分土地。同年减租清债开始，与地主有租息关系的人又得到一部分土地及粮食，地主阶级在经济上受到大量的削弱。但因地区距敌过近，汉奸势力仍与本村地主勾结，成立帮会及迷信团体三四种，迷惑群众，不久（一年多）亦为我先后破获。
    当时执行统一战线政策有点偏右，地主仍能借合法掩护自己。靳高瑞（永茂祥）之子靳耀华在县里当高小校长，于减租清债时和群众作公开的说理斗争，群众无可如何。小学教员刘××张干周在本村当小学教员，成立教育会，秘密发展国民党组织，以支持村里地主潜在势力。
    四三年大灾荒，中农以下多流亡逃散，青壮年多赴东北，死于外或生死不明者甚多，在家饿死者也有。这时政府虽发有救济粮，但村干部不民主，少数人专政，穷而无势者领不上，而合作社（发粮机关）及其有关人员则均可大吃大喝。灾荒过后，一二年之久，逃亡的人才慢慢回来。在渡荒工作中犯了错误的人（靳才垣等）经过处分撤换后（也不彻底），村里工作才好了一点。后来又经过复查，按问题算帐，平分果实，群众又得到了一点补充。
    从开辟工作起至五四指示以前，本村工作只是光杆子干部与地主作战，打下地主优势后，自己又学了他们的作风来统治其他群众，虽经区级纠正，但纠正得不彻底，几个老党员老干部直到现在变化还不大。
    五四指示以后，本村作过四、五次斗争（连反特务在内），一次比一次激烈，直到去年秋季的最后一次，才基本上剿灭了封建势力老巢。但干部亲友地主仍未斗透。在新势力方面，党员增至四十七人（现除参军或其他原因减去者外尚余三十九人），积极分子（非干部党员者）也有四五十人，为执行五四指示的队伍（成份是贫雇占绝大多数）。
    这些人，在历史上久已与地主形成对立，故在没收土地和浮财上是积极的，但在最后一二次，把斗争面扩大，误将富裕中农扩大为斗争对象，这原因现在还没有研究清楚，可能是为了使果实增多，或者是政治上的仇恨。
    在分配果实方面，原则上是填平补齐，事实上土地作到了填平的形式（每口人平均五石以上的应产粮），不过实质上仍有差别：（一）干部一般的高。农会委员赵恒树一个人有九亩好近地，二十石挂零的产量。（二）抗属一般照顾得过火，多半分的村边好地。赵恒义家六口人，三十七亩半地，一个人十一石多产量，多半是好近地。（三）非干部积极分子与非抗属的贫雇得到的地质量坏，亩数多，虽有同等的应产量，可是误工很大，仍是窟窿。靳廷全一个人九亩地，又远又坏，换人家二亩地还换不到。据三个闾的统计（全村二十五闾），七七户中，有三七户还是窟窿户。与上述情况大体相同。（四）所谓平均产量是最低数，最高数则几乎无限制。浮财有一部分存在农会未动，而已动的浮财分得亦不甚公平：（一）干部和抗属得的好房多。（二）抗属得的牲口、农具、家具、衣服等均比普通群众多。
    在工作方式上，干部和积极分子完全代替了群众，凡扣押对象、没收家产、分配果实之类的事，几乎全部是这百余个人做，其他群众则仅仅是开大会看看热闹，有时也举一举拳头。有些群众，一方面分得果实，一方面仍可怜地主，或毫不干政。
    干群关系：村干部作风不民主，一般对群众态度不好，常耍利害。群众对他们害怕，不敢说话，因此也就产生了分配果实的不公。老实贫雇有许多至今没有翻透身，对干部痛恨。中农方面由于干部为避免自己退果实而斗争了不少富裕中农，也存在相当普遍的不满情绪。加以村中有一个荣退军人小宗派，为与干部争权争利，时常找借口挑起不满，故形成干群关系的恶化。四七年夏季干部洗脸擦黑时，荣退军人与中农利用贫农的不满情绪，掀起反干部浪潮。上级两头撑腰，在群众稍稍提了一点意见之后就开始给干部表功，结果干部的脸没有洗成，反而打击了群众，干部乘机对群众报复，打击了为首的分子。至此，表面平静了，谁也不说话，但隔阂更深了。群众仇恨干部超过了仇恨地主。过去领导上迷惑于表面现象，觉得赵庄没甚问题。从现在开始了解的情况看，问题并不少。全面的情况，还需要在以后的平分土地运动中，继续做周密的了解。
