    Using the Party Newspaper to Improve Work

    Comrades working in some villages in the Ninth District of Wu'an County have consciously used the Party newspaper as a weapon in their village work, and have gained some preliminary experience, which is offered for reference:

    When comrades in Zhao Village participated in the movement, they kept records of materials from all aspects, regularly reported to each other, exchanged information, and conducted research. During the research, everyone clearly understood the development and characteristics of the movement, discovered the consistency and contradictions in various materials, and then clarified various issues based on research and discussion. They assigned a person to be responsible for organizing the results of this research and writing a draft report, which was then reviewed and corrected by everyone before being submitted to the newspaper for publication. After publication, everyone further studied it among the masses to improve their work.

    After working in Hexi Village for half a month, the comrades believed it necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the collected materials, explain the characteristics, and provide them to the Party newspaper. They convened a special meeting to discuss the situation. The study of the situation revealed that although many materials had been collected in the past, due to a lack of research, everyone had not distinguished the purpose of the investigated materials. Which were important and which were not? Many materials were not synthesized, so they could not be further improved. At the meeting, everyone raised some more comprehensive questions and went to the masses again to investigate, and then wrote a news report. This report represented their understanding and was prepared to be continuously revised and improved as the movement deepened.

    Comrades in Tian'erzhuang Village combined the results of their investigations with their mutual ideological reflections to write a news report. In this way, they could publicize both the problems in their work and the problems in their personal ideology and work style to the masses, mobilize the masses to study the work of the village, and also provide them with the necessary supervision.

    In places where mobilizing the masses and using the Party newspaper to promote work are consciously combined, farmers can gradually understand and use the Party newspaper. For example, after the Zhao Village news was published in the newspaper, the people of Zhao Village scrambled to read it, and some asked to correct their names. After the Shidong news was published, the masses said: "The newspaper's coverage is not enough, we have more materials!" An elderly poor peasant woman asked to have her opinion published in the newspaper, saying: "Why publish Yinghui's mother's opinion and not mine?" After the Hexi news was published, the working comrades systematically read it with the cadres and the masses. The masses were more motivated after reading it, and the cadres became more honest after hearing it, which was helpful to the movement.

### 运用党报改进工作

    运用党报改进工作
    武安九区有些村庄的工作同志，在做村的工作中有意识的做到运用党报这一武器，获得一些初步经验。可供参考：
    赵庄村工作同志参加运动时，随时记下各方面材料，经常的互相汇报，交换情况，进行研究。在研究时，大家明确的认识了运动的发展状况和特点，发现了各种材料的一致性和有矛盾的地方，然后依据研究和讨论明确了各种问题。他们把这种研究的结果由专人负责整理，写成报告草稿，然后再由大家相互审阅校正，同意后即交报纸发表。发表后大家进一步在群众中进行研究，改进工作。
    河西村工作同志做了半个月村的工作后，大家认为有必要把搜集的材料做一全面分析，说明特点，提供给党报。大家召开了专门会议对情况，一研究情况发现了过去调查的材料很多，由于缺乏研究，大家没分清调查的材料用处在那里？哪些是重要的，哪些是不重要的？许多材料没有综合起来，以致没能进一步提高。在会议中大家又提出了一些更全面的问题，分头再到群众中调查，然后写成新闻报导，这一报导代表他们的认识，准备在运动深入中继续修正、提高。
    田二庄工作同志，把他们调查的结果，结合上他们彼此的思想反省写成新闻报导。这样，可以把工作上的问题和个人思想作风的问题，都公布到群众面前，发动群众研究村的工作，同时也给他们以必要的监督。
    以上凡是有意识的把发动群众和运用党报推动工作结合起来的地方，也都能逐步地使农民认识党报，运用党报。譬如报上发表赵庄消息后，赵庄老百姓争相阅读，有的要求更正自己的名字。石洞消息发表后，群众认为：“报纸登的还不够，我们的材料还多着啦！”一位贫农老太太要求给自己登报，她说：“为什么登英会娘的，不登我的意见呢？”河西消息发表后，工作同志有计划的分头同干部群众阅读，群众看了劲头更大，干部听了老实，对运动有些帮助。
