　　Border Region Government Issues Urgent Directive
　　Combine Land Reform with Spring Planting Preparations
　　[News from this newspaper] Spring planting is approaching, and the Border Region Government has issued a special directive to urgently prepare for spring planting. The directive states: Spring has begun, and spring planting work must be urgently prepared. Due to the war entering a counter-offensive phase and the deepening of land reform, favorable conditions have been created for this year's spring planting. However, it is estimated that in most areas of our region, land redistribution will occur around the time of spring planting. Therefore, spring planting must be carried out in conjunction with land reform as the main focus, in order to ensure that agricultural seasons are not missed, early planting is carried out, land is not left barren, and efforts are made to increase the yield per mu by three sheng of fine grain this year. Time is running out! We must immediately start organizing spring planting preparations. In the preparations, we must also pay attention to preventing spring famine and solving the difficulties in disaster-stricken areas. Regarding spring planting work, we put forward the following suggestions for reference and implementation:
 甲. Our region has a severe shortage of livestock. After the peasants have been allotted land, livestock has become an extremely important requirement. The solution: First, combine the property distributed to the peasants with agricultural loans to carry out large-scale livestock purchases. The source of livestock is firstly from the government contacting friendly neighboring regions that produce livestock. Without affecting their land laws, agree on the possible quantity of imports, and carry out organized, mass-based bartering with our region's exportable materials (the government has already conducted consultations, and each district can also consider doing so). Second, protect existing livestock and prevent spring epidemics. In addition to the efforts of the Agricultural College of Peking University to train and transform new and old veterinarians, governments at all levels should strengthen the education and transformation of old veterinarians, promote apprenticeship, and cultivate new veterinary talents who are loyal to serving the people. Third, strictly prohibit the illegal slaughter of livestock and prohibit exports. Governments at all levels and trade departments must strictly inspect this.
 乙. Replenish agricultural implements. Governments at all levels should have a planned organization of blacksmith shops to repair and manufacture agricultural implements. To complete this work, trade departments should assist cooperatives in organizing purchases from regions that produce agricultural implements. Advocate the method of ordering ironware for cooperatives, and encourage poor peasants to jointly purchase large agricultural implements (such as drills and harrows). Reward improvements in manufacturing. Relevant industrial departments should also vigorously support this.
 丙. Due to last year's disaster and land changes after land reform, we must pay attention to the protection and regulation of seeds to ensure that poor peasants have seeds to sow when the time comes for sowing. Agricultural and forestry workers should go to the countryside to study in practice, combine with the experience of the masses, and promote improved varieties and improve farming methods bit by bit. Oppose the past subjective style of being high above, detached from the masses, and forced promotion.
 丁. Enable the masses to seize the time to transport manure, plow the spring land, dig the edges and build embankments, and repair canals.
 戊. In order to complete this year's special crop planting plan (issued to various administrative offices), the suitable planting areas should be immediately determined, seeds prepared and regulated, and technical personnel trained. In addition to the sugar beet production training class which has already been opened, other flue-cured tobacco, indigo dye, etc., must be prepared. Tobacco leaf planting and flue-cured tobacco production are the responsibility of the Agricultural College of Peking University and the Linqing Farm, and dye production is the responsibility of the industrial departments, in order to assist the masses in carrying out production. When planting indigo, it is necessary to simultaneously educate the masses on making indigo and promote indigenous indigo dyeing workshops.
 己. Mountain afforestation, prohibition of mountain access for forest protection, and plain area tree planting, etc., all the work of demarcating forbidden mountains, collecting tree seeds, organizing sowing, and preparing tree seedlings, etc., it is hoped that it will be completed by the agricultural and forestry bureaus and farms of governments at all levels before the Qingming Festival, according to the letter from the Cooperation Department of the Border Region Government.
 庚. Prevent insect pests. Each agricultural and forestry bureau and farm should collect effective mass insect control experience, study indigenous pesticides, and exchange and promote them. And the use methods of imported insecticides should be tested.
 辛. The planned and necessary flood control, water conservancy construction, and plain area well-digging for drought prevention work should be implemented in a planned manner, seizing the time. Those directly responsible by the Border Region Government will be notified separately.
 壬. Areas severely affected by last year's disaster must immediately provide relief for the spring famine. The basic method is to organize the masses to engage in production for self-relief, and implement work-for-relief with a certain amount of relief grain (separate instructions will be issued).
 癸. Loans that have not yet been issued in various places must be quickly loaned to poor peasants to prepare for spring planting. In the full-scale land reform in the region, in order to ensure the progress and completion of these preparations, governments at all levels must combine land reform and designate specific personnel to be responsible for doing it. Otherwise, there will be irreparable losses to the interests of the masses and support for the war when the sowing season arrives. If land redistribution has not been completed and the sowing season has arrived, it is even more important to be good at combining, without missing the sowing. Whether the land has been distributed or not, it should not be left barren. Combining land reform with production, and combining land reform, war, and production in the border areas, the masses in various places have considerable rich experience and creation. Mutual cooperation in land reform will surely bring great improvements and development. It is hoped that attention will be paid to research.

　　边区政府紧急指示
  　结合土地改革准备春耕
    【本报消息】春耕将到，边府特指示紧急准备春耕工作。指示称：立春已过，春耕工作须紧急准备。由于战争转入反攻，与土地改革的深入，给今年春耕创造了有利的条件。但估计我区大部地区，平分土地正是春耕前后，因之春耕必须在以土地改革为主的情况下结合进行，以求作到不违农时，趁晌早种，做到土地不荒芜，并争取每亩在今年增产三升细粮。时间不早了！当前就必须立即着手，组织春耕准备工作。在准备中并须注意防止春荒，解决灾荒中的困难问题。关于春耕工作，我们提出以下意见，请参照执行：甲、我区牲口奇缺，农民分得土地后，牲畜成为极紧要的要求。解决办法：第一、把农民分得的财物，和农贷结合起来，进行大量购买牲畜。其来源一是由政府向出产牲畜之友邻区接洽，在不影响其土地法令条件下，商定可能进口的数量，以我区可以输出之物资，有组织的、群众性的实行换购（本府已进行商洽，各区亦可斟酌进行）。第二、保护现有牲畜，防止春瘟。除北大农学院努力培养和改造新旧兽医外，各级政府应加强旧兽医的教育和改造，提倡带徒弟，培养忠实为人民服务的新兽医人才。第三、严禁违法宰杀牲畜，并禁止出口，各级政府与贸易部门须严格检查。乙、补充农具。各级政府应有计划的组织铁匠炉，进行修补制造农具。为完成这一工作，贸易部门要协助合作社，向出产农具区域组织购买。提倡对合作社订购铁货办法，并提倡贫苦农民合伙购置大农具（如耧、耙等）。奖励改良制造，有关工业部门，对此亦应大力负责支持。丙、由于去年灾荒，及土地改革后土地变动，必须注意种子的保护与调剂，以保证贫苦农民到下种时有种可播。农林工作人员，应该下乡去到实际中学习，结合群众经验，一点一滴的进行推广优良品种，改进农作方法。反对过去高高在上，脱离群众，强迫推广的主观主义的作风。丁、使群众能争取时间，及时送粪、犁春地、刨边垒堰、修理渠道。戊、为完成今年特种作物的种植计划（已发各行署），应立即确定适宜种植地区，准备与调剂种子，培养技术人才。除种植糖萝卜制糖训练班已开办外，其他各烤烟、栽蓝土染料等，都须着手准备。种烟叶与烤烟叶由北大农学院及临清农场负责，染料制作由工业部门负责，以协助群众进行。栽蓝必须同时教育群众打靛，及推广土靛染坊。已、山地播种造林，禁山护林，平原插枝植树等工作，所有划定禁山，收集树种，组织播种，准备树秧等工作，希按本府合作厅函告，由各级政府农林局、农场，在清明节前完成。庚、预防虫害，各农林局农场，应收集有效的群众除虫经验，研究土药剂，交流推广。并应将外来杀虫药使用办法，加以试验。辛、已有计划及必须计划进行的防治水患，兴修水利，平原打井防旱工作，争取时间有计划的实施，由本府直接负责者另函告。壬、去年灾荒严重地区，须立即救济春荒。基本办法，是组织群众生产自救，并以一定救济粮，实施以工代赈（另有指示）。癸、各地贷款未发下者，要迅速贷到贫苦农民手里，以准备春耕。在全区全力进行土地改革中，为保证这些准备工作的进行与完成，各级政府必须结合土地改革，指定一定的人负责去做。否则将会于播种季节到来时，措手不及，对群众利益及支援战争遭致不可挽救的损失。如果平分土地未完，而播种季节已到，更要善于结合，不误下种。土地无论已分未分，要不使荒芜。土地改革与生产结合，及边沿区土地改革、战争与生产结合，各地群众都有相当丰富的经验与创造，在土地改革中互相合作，必有很大改进发展，均希注意研究。
