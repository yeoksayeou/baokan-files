　　After Rectifying the Ranks
    Preliminary Ideological Examination in Work
    Li Ming
    We welcome comrades from all areas of the border region who are participating in land reform work to share their work situations, exchange work opinions, study work problems, and collectively resolve them by gathering diverse perspectives. Whether systematic or fragmented, materials or insights; whether in the form of articles, letters, communications, or diaries, any form is acceptable, as long as you write down what you want to say; please avoid Party jargon and empty talk. Other comrades with differing opinions can also write letters to discuss. Each place has its specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for reference.

    Before the rectification of the ranks, I had serious landlord-rich peasant thoughts, emotions, and work style; I was the son of a landlord class who had not been well reformed. My thoughts were a confused mess. After three months of study, with the help and education of the Party, I began to recognize myself and the landlord family.

    After studying, I felt that my individual landlord class ideology was very serious. Therefore, I asked the Party to give me a severe punishment, to leave a mark on my landlord class ideology and bad work style, so as to better change this bad ideology and work style in actual work. When accepting the punishment given to me by the Party, my understanding was this: the punishment given by the Party was an education for me, it was a blow to my individual landlord ideology, and it was an encouragement to my Party spirit. Therefore, I was happy after accepting the punishment. At the same time, I also considered that after accepting the punishment, it is necessary to prevent the emergence of two bad tendencies: one is to let the punishment压住压住 (smother) me so that I cannot lift my head up. This would indicate that although I have gone through study, I have not awakened and have not enhanced my Party spirit. This is not the attitude of a class fighter. The second is that I feel that the punishment given to me by the Party is nothing, nothing great. This tendency is that I have not been vigilant about my serious landlord class ideology. Neither of these two things is the correct attitude towards the punishment given to me by the Party. In the future, no matter which tendency I develop, if it continues to develop, it will take me out of the revolutionary camp and all the way to the path of death.

    After rectifying the ranks, I realized that this study is only the beginning of transforming my personal stance and ideology. In the future, I should pay more attention to constantly and ruthlessly打击打击 (strike) the revival of my landlord class ideology. Therefore, I made up my mind to go to the masses to temper myself, but who knew that my motivation to make up my mind was still somewhat impure! There is a kind of personal "not convinced" feeling, thinking that "I was wrong in the past, look at me in the future." This is obviously not a truly serve-the-poor-and-hired attitude. This attitude is still standing on the original landlord class position. Finally, with the help of other comrades, I established a correct attitude. I considered preventing the non-correct attitude of "being angry" or "not convinced" after studying. The correct attitude should be an honest attitude, constantly and actively working. Establish the attitude of "learning everything from scratch," "tempering myself in actual work," and "willing to be a primary school student of the masses."

    In this period of practical work, I have gained new things that I have never heard of before. These new things make me feel excited and happy. However, in the actual work process, I also exposed the tail of my personal landlord ideology.

    Accepting the review of poor and lower-middle peasants and working under their supervision. When I visited the Duan Tianzeng couple, after two conversations, Duan Tianzeng only said some very superficial things about himself and the simple situation in the village. At that time, he showed a lot of fear. During the conversation, when he heard the sound of someone walking outside, he would stop talking. The third time I went to his house, it happened that his wife was also at home. At this time, Tianzeng's wife kept looking at me. She said that I didn't look like a farmer, but like someone from a military unit. At that time, I clearly told her: In the future, we will implement a new method—equally distributing the land and letting the poor be the masters. She said: She also heard her son say that a new method would be implemented. This shows that I came here to find poor people to do this. After such a conversation, the couple seemed a little distrustful of me. She looked at me and asked where I was from, who was in my family, and how much land I cultivated. At that time, I was a little unhappy, thinking that I had come to do things for you wholeheartedly, why ask me so many details? Later, I thought that this was because they didn't trust me, so I told her that when she heard that my family was also old money, they both became indignant and stared at me. She asked me again, what about your family! Do you still have parents? I also explained to her that the family is old money, and old money oppresses and persecutes the poor. I no longer recognize that as my home... Although after such an explanation, the atmosphere between each other was still not very harmonious. At this time, the old man Tianzeng asked me where I lived and whether I had found the village cadres. I told him that I had found a place myself, but I couldn't see any of the village cadres. Immediately afterwards, I said that I had just come here and didn't know anyone, so I was afraid of finding the wrong poor people, and hoped to help find some poor people. After such a conversation, the couple felt a little relieved and told me a lot of things. Another time, I took a few autumn grain public grain account books from the cooperative. The poor peasant Yinghui Niang asked me who I wanted them for? What did you say to the cadres? What did the cadres say to you? She questioned me in detail. At that time, I also felt in my heart that she didn't trust me too much, and she was not relieved that I was taking an account book. Another time, I found a person to talk to, who used to be the village chief (I didn't know it at the time). The poor peasant Tujin stared at me and asked, who told you to find him? He is a有法的有法的 (law-abiding)... The supervision of me was very severe, and at that time, I simply thought that the poor and hired's review and supervision of me was that the poor and hired should not distrust me. I did not examine myself. I was born in a landlord class family. I only said in my mouth that I had come to do things for the poor and hired peasants. They would not believe it. Therefore, they should and must review and supervise me. Otherwise, how could they believe you? Especially since I had no concept of the poor and hired in the past, the poor and hired regarded you as someone who oppressed them. When you say that you sincerely serve them, the poor and hired must review and supervise you to see if you are sincere or insincere.

    Waiting for the awakening of the poor and hired, breaking their ideological concerns, and gradually combining with them emotionally. Through Duan Tianzeng's introduction, I visited the three-generation carpenter Duan Guangyun. The first time I went, he showed fear and dared not say anything. I explained the Land Law to him, and in the future, the poor would be the masters, but he always said "那可照那可照" (that can be done/good idea). If I didn't speak, he wouldn't say anything either, which made me a little anxious again. I still considered that I came to serve you sincerely, why don't you want to talk to me? But then I thought that being anxious would not solve the problem. I had no choice but to chat about other things. If I continued to ask, I was afraid of causing him more anxiety. I didn't think about how to break his ideological concerns and wait for him. The second time I went to find him, he still didn't want to say anything. At this time, I stopped asking him and asked him what he was doing today. He said he was going to pick up some firewood. I seized this opportunity to tell him that I would help him. He said: Huh! Can I ask comrades to accompany me to suffer this hardship! After explaining, I went to pick up firewood with him. In the process of picking up firewood, he was still uneasy, saying some polite words. I felt that he was hypocritical, and always thought that I was picking up firewood for him sincerely. After this firewood picking, the emotions of both parties got a little closer. Later, I often went to his house to help with some odd jobs, and no longer actively asked him about other things. After three or four days, because I found other poor and hired people, I didn't go to his place, but he would come to find me once a day, without saying anything, just taking a look and leaving. Slowly, he told me about his pain and the situation in the village. I knew Duan Tingyu, who was introduced by his mother herself (Duan Tingyu is Duan Tianzeng's son). Therefore, I thought he would definitely believe me. Every time I talked, I would explain it to break his ideological concerns. After four or five conversations, I felt that the emotional bond between the two parties was almost there. Later, he said to Tujin: It's bad, that person (referring to me) is from the newspaper office. He came to investigate and then publish it in the newspaper. If the cadres see it, they will retaliate. This is bad, "没有打了狐子白落了一片骚没有打了狐子白落了一片骚(killing no fox but getting your hands smeared with fox urine)" After I knew about this, I felt distressed. I treat you like this and it still doesn't work. How can you believe me? I didn't check this issue from my personal thoughts. I didn't wait enough for the poor peasants. I made a rash move. Especially since Tingyu suffered blows from the village cadres because he made suggestions in the cadre-mass relationship movement, his ideological concerns were relatively large. If I didn't think about opening his mind or waiting for him, his ideological problems would not be solved. I thought that as long as I sincerely did things for them, all problems would be solved. I lived in Zhang Tujin's house and also showed my impatience. When Tujin was polite to me, I was very unhappy. For example, when sleeping, Tujin's quilt was much thinner than mine, but he always asked me to sleep in a warm place and cover myself with his cotton jacket. I was impatient and thought that he shouldn't treat me so politely. It wasn't until later that he asked me to help with some things that I felt happy in my heart. I didn't check these issues. Why would the poor and hired treat me like this? I didn't realize that the poor and hired saw the workers as different, thinking that the workers were "officials," especially since my personal work style hadn't completely changed. Therefore, they treated me so politely.

    After truly combining with the poor and hired emotionally, the poor and hired will criticize you unceremoniously for things that are not right. Once when I was with Zhang Tujin, I wanted to throw away the crushed tobacco crumbs because there was dirt in them. He said that I was throwing away the tobacco for nothing, just like the old money. Another time, I was organizing his materials. After I finished writing, I read it to him. Originally, it was a matter of distributing a torn mourning garment. I wrote that I had distributed a set of mourning garments. He raised an objection and said, "That one was given to me by you. I distributed a torn mourning garment. I said it several times and you can't remember it." At that time, I felt sad in my heart, resenting why I didn't pay attention to these details! Compared with Tujin, I am far behind.

    After this period of work, I had a one-sided view of the poor and hired. I overly believed in the poor and hired, thinking that the poor and hired had good components and their class nature was strong in seeing problems. I didn't see their backward side. This was mainly manifested in the issue of village cadres and middle peasants. At first, I consciously ignored the village cadres, especially when there were poor and hired people present. I put on airs. In terms of attitude towards the middle peasants, I felt that I hadn't gained the trust of the poor and hired yet, so I couldn't carry out middle peasant work. Especially when there were not many poor and hired people, I thought this way. I haven't found the poor and hired yet, so where do I have the mind to find the middle peasants? Therefore, what was shown was that I didn't treat the middle peasants as closely and generously as I treated the poor and hired, and I didn't treat the village cadres as closely and generously as I treated the middle peasants. I was always worried in my mind that I would alienate my relationship with the poor and hired because of doing middle peasant work. This kind of thinking is a "leftist" manifestation of myself.

    × × × × × × Comrades participating in land distribution from various places:
    After you arrive in the village, how do you approach the poor and hired? How do you publicize the Land Law and carry out work? What problems and difficulties have you encountered in your work?

　　整顿队伍以后
    工作中的思想初步检查
    力明
    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加土地改革工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。　
    在未整顿队伍前，我存在着严重的地富思想、情感及作风，是一个未经很好改造的地主阶级的儿子。思想模糊的乌七八糟，经过三个月的学习，在党的帮助教育之下，自己才开始认识了自己，认识了地主家庭。
    经过学习后感到个人的地主阶级思想是很严重的，因此自己要求党给自己以严重的处分，给自己的地主阶级思想及坏的作风留一记号，以便在实际工作中更好的改变这种不良的思想作风。在接受党给予自己的处分时，自己是这种认识的：党给予的处分是对我的一个教育，是打击了个人的地主思想，是鼓舞了我的党性的一面。因此个人在接受处分后是愉快的。同时也考虑到，接受处分后，要防止两种不良的倾向的产生：一种是叫处分压住自己抬不起头来，这样就表明自己虽然经过学习而没有觉悟起来，没有增强自己的党性，这样不是一个阶级战士的姿态，第二种是个人感到党给自己的处分不算什么，没有什么了不起，这种倾向是使咱对自己的严重的地主阶级的思想性还未警惕起来，这两种东西都不是对待党给予自己处分的正确态度。今后不管自己产生哪一种倾向，使其发展下去，会将自己走出革命阵营以外，一直走到死亡的道路。
    经过整顿队伍后，自己认识到：这次学习仅仅是转变个人立场、思想的开始，今后更应注意不断的、无情的打击自己地主阶级思想的复活。因此自己下了决心到群众中去锻炼，但谁知自己下了决心动机还有些不纯！有一种个人“不服气”，认为“过去错了今后看”，这很显然自己还不是真正为贫雇服务的态度，这种态度仍是站在原来的地主阶级立场上的。最后，在别的同志帮助下，才树立起正确的态度，自己才考虑到今后防止学习后个人“赌气”或者“不服气”那种非正确的态度，正确的应该是老老实实的态度，经常的积极工作下去。树立起“一切从头学起”，“到实际工作中去锻炼”，“甘心当群众的小学生”的态度。
    在这一段实际工作中，自己获得从所未闻过新的东西，这种新的东西使自己感到兴奋愉快。但在实际工作过程中，也暴露了个人的地主思想的尾巴。
    接受贫苦农民的审查，在贫苦农民的监督下进行工作。我访问段天增夫妇时，经过两次的谈话，段天增才将自己事情及村里简单情况很皮毛的说了一些，当时他表现了很骇怕，谈话中，听到外边有走路声音，他就停下来不说了。第三次我去他家时，赶上他老婆也在家，这时天增媳妇一直在看我，她说我不象庄稼人，是部队机关里的，当时我也就明白的告诉了她：以后实行新办法——平分土地，叫穷人当家做主。她说：也听她儿子说要实行新办法。说明我来这里就是找穷人办这个事情。经过这样谈话后，她夫妇俩有些不相信我的样子，她看着我，问是哪里的，家里有什么人，种多少地。我当时思想有些不高兴，以为自己决心为你们办事情来了，问我这样详细干啥，后来想到这是对我不放心，于是我就告诉了她，听说家庭也是老财的时候，她俩个态度上都愤发了，在一边瞪着眼睛看着我。她又问我你家里怎样啦！你还有爹娘没有？我随着也给她解释，家庭是老财，老财都是欺压迫害穷人的，我不再认那是我的家……。虽然经过这样的解释，但互相之间空气仍不十分调和，这时天增老汉又问我住在哪里，找村干部了没有，我给他说自己找的地方，村干部一个也不见，紧接着提出我才来这里，一个人也不认识，找穷人怕找错了，希望帮助找一些穷人。经过这样的谈话后，她夫妇才有些放心，给我说了不少的事情。又一次我在合作社拿了几本秋季公粮粮帐，贫农英会娘就问我给谁要的？你给干部说啥话啦？干部给你说了些啥？把我详详细细的追问了一番，当时自己思想上也感到她太不相信我了，拿本帐对我也不放心。又一次找了一个人谈话，这个人过去当过村长（当时不知道），贫农土金就瞪着眼睛问我，谁叫你找他哩？他是个有法的………对我监视非常利害，而我当时思想上将贫雇对我的审查和监视单纯的认为贫雇不应该不相信我，没有从自己本身来检查，自己是从地主阶级出身，仅仅在嘴里说为贫雇农民办事情来了，他们是不会相信的，因此他们对我应该而且必然的要审查和监视，不然他们对你怎么能够相信呢？特别是过去自己根本就没有贫雇观念，贫雇把你看成压迫他的人，当你说真心为他们服务的时候，贫雇一定要审查和监视着你，考察你是真心还是假意。
    等待贫雇的觉悟，打破他们思想顾虑，在情感上慢慢结合起来。经段天增介绍，我访问了三辈子木工段光云。我第一次去，他表现怕，什么都不敢说。我给他解释土地法，以后叫穷人当家，但他都是说“那可照”（好的意见）。我不说话他也不吭声，因此使自己又有些急燥，仍然考虑到自己是诚心诚意为你服务来了，怎么不愿意给我说话呢？但又想到光急燥办不了事情，只好闲扯别的事情，如果再继续问怕引起他更大的不安，没有想到如何打破他的思想顾虑，等待他一下。第二次找他去了，他仍然不愿说什么。这时我就不再问他了，问他今天干啥活，他说准备拾把柴火去，我就抓紧这个机会给他说我也帮你去，他说：咦！还能叫同志陪伴着我受这个苦哩！经过解释后，和他算一块拾柴去了。在拾柴的当中，他仍然不安，说些客气话，自己感到他虚伪了，老想自己给他拾柴是诚心诚意的。经过这次拾柴，双方的情感有些靠拢，以后我常去他家里，帮助做个零活，再不主动的问他别的事情。过了三、四天后，因为我又找到别的贫雇，没有去他那里，而他每天要找我一趟，也不说什么看一看就走，慢慢的才将他的痛苦及村里的情况告诉了我。我认识段廷玉，是他娘亲自介绍的（段廷玉即段天增的儿子），因此认为他一定会相信我，每次谈话，我都是解释一番想打破他思想顾虑，经过四、五次谈话，感到双方情感结合，还差不多，后来他对土金说：坏了，人家（指我）是报馆里的，他来调查了事就登报，报纸叫干部看见了，又要报复吧，这一下子可坏了，“没有打了狐子白落了一片骚”。我知道这个事情以后，思想感到苦闷，我这样对待你还不行，到底怎样才能相信我呢？没有从个人思想来检查这个问题，自己对贫苦农民等待不够，犯了急性病，特别是廷玉在干群关系运动中，因提意见遭到村干部的打击，思想顾虑比较大，不想法打通思想或等待他，他思想问题是不会解决的。认为只要诚恳的为他们办事情，啥问题也解决了。我住在张土金家里，也表现了个人性急，土金对自己客气时，自己就很不高兴，例如睡觉时，土金的被子比我的被子薄的多，但他老叫我睡热地方、盖他的棉袄，自己不耐烦，认为他不应该这样客气对待我。直到后来，他有些事情叫我帮助做，思想上才愉快了，对这些问题，没有检查，贫雇为什么会这些对待自己，不认识贫雇把工作员看成二样的，认为工作员是“官”特别是个人的作风还未彻底转变。因而对待我就这样客气。
    真正和贫雇在感情上结合起来以后，贫雇对你不对的地方会不客气的批评。我和张土金在一块，一次是因为碎烟沫有土，想抛掉，他说我把烟白白扔了和老财一样。又一次整理他的材料，写完后我读给他听，原来是分一件破孝衣，我写的是分了一身孝衣，他就提出意见来了，他说：“那一件是你给我的，分了一件破孝衣，说了好几回你就记不住。”当时自己思想上感到难过，怨恨自己在这些地方为什么就注意不到呢！以个人和土金来比，差的太远了。
    经过这一段工作，自己思想上又产生了片面的贫雇观点，过分的相信贫雇，认为贫雇成份好，他们看问题阶级性强，没有看他们落后的一面，这主要表现在对村干部及中农问题上，开始对村干部有意识的不理他们，特别有贫雇在场时，自己摆着架子，对中农态度上，认为还没有获得贫雇的信任，不能进行中农工作，特别是贫雇不多的时候，自己就这样想，贫雇还未找到，哪里有心思找中农去，因此，表现出来的对中农没有对待贫雇近厚，对村干没有对待中农近厚，自己思想老顾虑到，不要因为做中农工作而疏远了和贫雇的关系，这种思想是自己“左”一种表现。
    ×　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×　　　　　×各地参加土地平分的同志：
    你们到村后，如何接近贫雇？如何宣传土地法开展工作？工作中经到些什么问题和困难？如何解决的？犯了些什么错误？如何纠正？有些什么经验？你们自整党后，在运动的考验中思想有何变化和收获？各村工作面貌特点如何？有些什么具体问题？都请你们及时写给报纸，我们今后将用最大篇幅发表。
