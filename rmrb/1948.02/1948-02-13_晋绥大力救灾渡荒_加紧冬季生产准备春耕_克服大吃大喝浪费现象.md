Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 9th: Farmers in Yangjiapo Village, Xing County, which suffered severe disasters last year, are launching a surge of production and thrift, preparing for spring plowing, and have put forward the slogan "Guarantee to survive the spring famine and strive not to starve people to death." The whole village has specifically stipulated the advance sowing of peas, spring wheat and other summer harvest crops, and the planting of more early-maturing spring vegetables. They are now preparing seeds, practicing thrift, mixing coarse grains and bran into meals, and confiscating the landlords' food, temporarily storing it all for use during spring plowing. Organize labor exchange. In the past, land and cattle were controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and labor exchange was difficult. Now that land and cattle have returned to the peasants, "labor exchange is a good way to get ahead." It has been decided to form labor exchange groups centered on cattle to achieve deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and to exchange labor with other villages to exchange labor and fodder. Farm implements are uniformly adjusted by the entire administrative village, and landlords and rich peasants are urged to participate in labor. In winter production, some landlords have earned a lot of food. Now that there is more than a month before spring plowing, it has been decided to seize winter production, organize women to spin and weave, continue transportation, cut grass, and solve the problems of food rations and livestock fodder.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 9th: Amidst the famine relief efforts, individual remote villages have successively discovered incidents of rural gangsters and other bad elements leading the waste of struggle gains. Two retired bad cadres from Xinyaoshang and other three villages in Pian Guan County led more than 20 people to "investigate" the gains of the struggle, eating more than 270 jin of various noodles and more than 50 jin of pork and mutton in ten days. In Quan'er Shang Village, the county fought landlords and ate "night meals," with 36 people eating 59 jin of pork at one time. Bad cadres in Majialiang, Lan County, even organized "mass meals." In Xihui Village, Ke Lan County, 25 kilns of landlord's yams were sealed up, but no one took care of them, and half of them were spoiled. Wen Cunfu, a local bully in Shizhaizi Village, Jing Le County, pretended to be a "poor peasant," controlled the farmers' association, slaughtered pigs and sheep, and ate and drank lavishly. These anti-revolutionary behaviors that violated the Outline Land Law and ignored the famine were exposed at the administrative village and district farmers' associations in various places, and the bad elements who led the waste were detained for investigation or dismissed from their posts.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 10th: Here, various agencies, factories, and troops have once again lowered their living standards to relieve the disaster. The Industrial Department of the Military Region issued a "Letter to Workers," deciding to temporarily suspend the issuance of allowances to relieve disaster victims, and calling on workers to fight against difficulties with the spirit of the proletariat. The workers in various factories warmly supported this. The adult workers' congress of the 10th Factory of the Department decided to save one or two liang of rice per person per day. Workers at the 7th Factory carried stones and burned lime themselves to build workshops, saving the public more than 6 million yuan in lime purchase costs, all of which was donated to disaster relief. After a review campaign, a certain unit deeply experienced the difficulties of the working people and is now practicing thrift and launching a campaign to save a handful of rice per person per day. In five villages in the Jiaocheng border area of Jinzhong, more than 100 soldiers and civilians attacked Zhengjiazhuang, a stronghold of the Yan bandits, last month, and seized more than 3,000 jin of grain, which was distributed to everyone according to the degree of poverty. Farmers in various places are now stepping up the last month of winter production before spring plowing.

    晋绥大力救灾渡荒
    加紧冬季生产准备春耕
    克服大吃大喝浪费现象
    【新华社晋绥九日电】去年遭灾严重的兴县杨家坡村农民正展开生产节约与准备春耕的热潮，并提出“保证渡过春荒，争取不饿死人”的口号。全村已具体规定提前播种碗豆、春麦等夏收作物，并多种早熟的春菜，现在已着手筹备种籽，力行节约，饭内掺杂粮和糠，没收地主的食粮，暂全部封存，留下春耕时动用。组织变工，过去土地和耕牛掌握在地主富农手里，变工闹不好，现在土地耕牛都回了老家，“变工是翻身的好办法”，决定以牛为中心组成变工组做到深耕细作，并可与外村变工，换回人工和草料。农具由全行政村统一调剂，并督促地主富农参加劳动，在冬季生产中有的地主已赚下不少粮食。现在离春耕一个多月，决定抓紧冬季生产，组织妇女纺织，继续运输、割草、解决口粮和牲畜草料。
    【新华社晋绥九日电】在救荒声中，此间个别偏僻村庄连续发现农村流氓及其他坏分子领头浪费斗争果实事件。偏关新窑上等三村两个退职坏干部，领导二十余人“清查”斗争果实，十天内吃掉各种面二百七十多斤、猪羊肉五十余斤。该县泉儿上村斗地主吃“夜餐”，三十六人一次就吃了五十九斤猪肉。岚县马家梁坏干部竟组织“大会餐”。苛岚西会村查封地主山药蛋二十五窑，无人保管，坏了一半。静乐石寨子村恶霸温存富冒充“贫农”，把持农会，杀猪宰羊，大吃大喝。这些违反土地法大纲及漠视渡荒的反革命行为，在各地行政村及区农会上被揭露后，已将领导浪费的坏分子扣押审查或予撤职。
    【新华社晋绥十日电】此间各机关、工厂、部队为救灾再度降低生活水平。军区工业部发表“告工人书”，决定暂时停发津贴，救济灾民，并号召工人，用无产阶级的精神向困难作斗争，各工厂工人对此均热烈拥护。该部第十厂成年工人大会决定，每天每人节省一两米。第七厂工友为建筑工房，自己背石头烧石灰，为公家节省买石灰费用六百余万元，全部献出救灾。某部经过回忆运动，更深刻体验劳动人民的困难后，现正厉行节约，并掀起每人每天节约一把米运动。晋中交城边缘区某五个村百余军民，曾于上月攻入阎匪据点郑家庄，夺回被抢粮食三千余斤，按贫苦程度分给大家。各地农民现正加紧春耕前最后一个月的冬季生产。
