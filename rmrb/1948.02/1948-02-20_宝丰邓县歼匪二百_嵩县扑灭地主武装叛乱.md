Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 17th: On the 8th, some of the local armed forces of the Fifth Military Sub-district cleared out bandits and diehards in the northwest area of Baofeng, and captured Daying, 30 miles away from the city, in one fell swoop, killing more than 60 bandits including the bandit leader Jin Liming, and capturing more than 70 alive. The bandits and diehards entrenched in Luzhuang, five miles northeast of Daying, fled upon hearing the news, and more than 80 were intercepted and captured by our pursuit. A total of 41 rifles and pistols and one heavy machine gun were seized. In addition, a part of the local armed forces of the Third Military Sub-district defeated more than 700 bandits and diehards near Luanchuan, killing and capturing more than 20 each.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Hubei, Henan and Anhui, 17th: Delayed news: On the 27th of last month, a part of the Tongbai Military Region Liberation Army annihilated a part of the Chiang bandit security team in Heilongmiao area north of Deng County, captured 51 people including the pseudo-Tanghe County Chief Wang Xianfu, seized a light machine gun, 50 rifles, a radio station and many other supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 17th: Farmers in 15 villages in Song County, with the assistance of local armed forces and combined with political disintegration, successfully suppressed the armed rebellion of reactionary landlords. In the mass movement in the area two months ago, reactionary landlords, incited by the Luoyang Chiang bandit authorities and the Song County Chiang bandit County Chief Gao Mao, gathered some small and medium landlords, hoodlums, and forcibly coerced individual honest farmers to participate in the rebellion. At that time, due to the lack of vigilance on the part of the leadership, three cadres, six activists, and two Taiyue war participants were killed by the bandits. Upon hearing the news, a certain unit of our military sub-district's local armed forces rushed to the scene and joined the masses in severely suppressing the bandits and diehards. In two consecutive battles, more than 20 bandits were killed, and the confidence of the masses greatly increased, while all the bandits and diehards were shaken, and the bandit leaders took the lead in fleeing. Most of the small and medium landlords and feudal rich peasants who participated in the rebellion asked people to mediate and prepared to surrender. The democratic government then adopted a lenient policy, issuing a proclamation that "those who hand over their guns will not be killed and will be given a portion of land" and "all those who are coerced to participate in the bandits will be given land to settle down after handing over their guns." Subsequently, more than a dozen bandit leaders handed over more than 70 rifles and three machine guns. More than 40 people who were won back by the masses through family members, relatives and friends to hand over their guns and return to righteousness were also given housing and land. Thus, the rebellion was completely suppressed. The masses accepted this bloody lesson and deeply launched a mass movement to collect guns, and collected 180 guns hidden by landlords and bandits within ten days, and organized hundreds of militiamen. Young peasants flocked to join the local armed forces, and after strict examination, 120 people were accepted into the army in two batches.

    宝丰邓县歼匪二百
    嵩县扑灭地主武装叛乱
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十七日电】八日，五分区地方武装一部清剿宝丰西北地区匪顽，一举攻克距城三十里的大营，毙匪首金礼明以下六十余名，生俘七十余名。盘踞大营东北五里芦庄之匪顽闻讯溃逃，被我追击截捕八十余名。共缴获长短枪四十一支、重机枪一挺。又三分区地方武装一部在滦川附近击溃匪顽七百余名，毙俘各二十余。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十七日电】迟到消息：桐柏军区解放军一部上月二十七日在邓县城北黑龙庙一带消灭蒋匪保安队一部，活捉伪唐河县长王宪辅以下五十一名，缴获轻机枪一挺、步枪五十支、电台一部，其他物资甚多。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十七日电】嵩县十五个村庄的农民，在地方武装协助下结合政治瓦解，胜利扑灭反动地主的武装叛乱。该区两月前群众运动中，反动地主受洛阳蒋匪当局及嵩县蒋匪县长高茂政策动，纠集了一些中小地主、兵痞流氓，并武力胁迫个别朴实农民参加叛乱。当时因领导上警觉性不高，遭匪杀害干部三人，积极分子六人，和两个太岳参战队员。我分区地方武装某部闻讯，当即赶往，结合群众痛剿匪顽。接连两次战斗中击毙土匪二十余名，群众信心大增，匪顽则全部动摇，匪首相率逃走。大部参加叛乱的中小地主和封建富农都请人说合，准备投降。民主政府乃本宽大政策，布告“交枪不杀并留一份土地”，和“凡被胁迫参加土顽者交枪后均分给土地，安家立业”。相继有十余个土匪头交出步枪七十余支，机枪三挺。群众通过家属、亲戚朋友争取回来交枪归正的亦有四十多人，都分了房地。于是叛乱完全扑灭。群众接受这次血的教训，深入展开了群众性的收枪运动，十天内共收了地主匪顽隐藏的枪支一百八十多条，组织了数百民兵。青年农民更群起要求参加地方武装，经严格审查后，两次共接受一百二十名入伍。
