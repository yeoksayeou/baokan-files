　　Soviet-Belgian-Luxembourg Trade Agreement Signed
　　Largest of its Kind Between the Soviet Union and Western European Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: Moscow dispatch: The trade and payment agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and the "Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union" here at the end of last month was formally signed on the 18th. The agreement stipulates the quantity and type of goods to be exchanged between the two parties in the next two years, and its scale is the largest ever between the Soviet Union and Western European continental countries. The Soviet Union will exchange grain and timber, cellulose, apatite, manganese ore and other industrial raw materials with Belgium and Luxembourg for industrial products such as rolled steel, cables, cranes, electrical equipment, transportation equipment, as well as leather, coffee, etc. Since the conclusion of the agreement at the end of last month, it has aroused the fury of American imperialism, which demanded that the Belgian parliament reject it, and through its lackeys in the Belgian ruling class, made various obstructions. However, it was formally signed due to the people's insistence and the exposure of reactionary conspiracies by public opinion. The Soviet Union and Belgium-Luxembourg have now agreed to begin negotiations on a treaty of commerce and navigation in the near future to replace the temporary commercial agreement of 1945. Furthermore, Prague dispatch: Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands signed a trade agreement on the 10th, with a total value of goods exchanged between the two parties reaching 94.45 million US dollars.

　　苏与比卢订换货协定
  　规模之大为苏与西欧大陆国家间的第一次
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联与“比（利时）卢（森堡）经济同盟”上月底在此间缔结之贸易与支付协定，已于十八日正式签字，协定规定今明两年间双方换货数量及种类，规模之大为苏联与西欧大陆国家间之首次。苏联将以谷物与木材、纤维素、磷灰石、锰矿砂等工业原料与比卢交换辗钢、电缆、起重机、电气器材、运输装备等工业制品及皮革、咖啡等。该约自上月底缔结以后，曾激起美国帝国主义之暴怒，要求比利时国会予以否决，并通过其在比利时统治阶层中之走狗予以多方阻挠，但终因人民坚持与舆论对反动阴谋之揭露而正式签字。现苏联与比卢间已同意在最近即开始进行缔结通商与航海条约之谈判，以代替一九四五年之临时商约。又布拉格讯，捷克与荷兰已于十日签订贸易协定，双方换货总值达九千四百五十万美元。
