Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, February 2nd: The Civil Affairs Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently summarized its work on mobilizing the masses accompanying the army during the four-month counteroffensive. According to incomplete statistics, from August 23rd, when it crossed the river south, to the end of December, the unit mobilized the masses (mainly by distributing floating wealth) in 1,201 villages, with approximately 530,000 peasants participating, distributing 33 million catties of grain and 1,787 mu of land. The result of this work is that the peasants have gained an understanding of and support for our army, and it has provided strong assistance to the construction of the Yu-Shaan-E liberated area. The troops participating in mobilizing the masses have also strengthened their mass viewpoint. However, two main shortcomings were also discovered in the movement. One is that the distribution of floating wealth was mostly hasty and perfunctory, and rich peasants also took the opportunity to participate. In addition, much of the landlords' floating wealth was dispersed and concealed in advance, so poor peasants did not gain much fruit, and it was not easy to inspire the enthusiasm of poor peasants, so it was not possible to cultivate active poor peasant activists well, so as to facilitate the in-depth development of the movement and the continued leadership of the local system. Therefore, it is necessary to organize them in the course of the movement. Another shortcoming is that it simply stopped at the stage of distributing floating wealth. However, the experience of several places has proved that even if the time is not long, as long as the method is correct, it can also be in-depth. In the movement, the masses' urgent demand is to disarm the landlords to arm themselves, and this demand is often more urgent than the distribution of floating wealth and land. If the peasants do not have armed forces to suppress the landlords' counter-offensive, they will not be able to keep anything that is distributed. Another key to going deeper is to strengthen the organizational work in the course of the movement. Among the villages that have been mobilized and the masses who have participated in the aforementioned statistics, the number of poor peasant groups or peasant associations that have been formed and the number of people who have participated in poor peasant groups or peasant associations is not large, and very little of the best complaint education has been adopted. Now, based on these experiences, we are boldly and actively taking the mass line to promote the work of mobilizing the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, February 2nd: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to mobilize the masses, and emphasized the need to learn from poor peasants and hired laborers in order to transform their own thinking and style. The Logistics Department alone sent 136 people to the countryside. Before departing, everyone proposed living the life of poor peasants, uniting with hired laborers, organizing complaints to raise the class consciousness of themselves and the masses, and learning the firm stance of hired laborers in the movement. Commander Wu Chengxian of the unit first carried his backpack and led a group of cadres from a key point village to set off. Chief of Staff Yang Jin also led another group to the countryside. They lived with hired laborers in the village, ate cornbread and corn and sorghum porridge with sesame leaves, and after eating the food of the hired laborers, they handed over all the grain and money for groceries they brought to the peasants. In addition to their work, they fetched water and did chores for the hired laborers.

    豫陕鄂解放军某部发动群众
    五十三万农民参加斗争
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】解放军某部民运部近曾总结反攻四个月的随军发动群众工作。根据不完全统计，自八月二十三日渡河南征迄十二月底，该部曾在一千二百零一个村庄发动过群众（主要是分浮财），参加的农民约有五十三万余人，分得粮食三千三百万斤，田地一千七百八十七亩。这一工作进行的结果，已取得农民对我军的了解与拥护，并对建设豫陕鄂解放区以有力的帮助。参加发动群众的部队并从而加强了群众观点。但是在运动中也发现了两个主要缺点。一个是分浮财时大多仓促草率，富农亦乘机参加，再加不少地主浮财事前均行分散隐蔽，所以雇贫得到果实不多，而不容易启发雇贫的积极性，因而不能很好培养雇贫积极分子，以便于运动的深入发展及地方系统的继续领导。因此需要在运动过程中组织起来。另一个缺点是单纯停在分浮财阶段。但是几个地方的经验证明，即使时间不长，只要做法对，同样可以深入的。在运动中群众迫切的要求是解除地主武装来武装自己，这一要求常常较之分浮分地更为迫切。农民如果没有武装去镇压地主的反攻，分配什么东西都是保不住的。深入的另一关键是加强运动过程中的组织工作。前述统计发动过的村庄与参加的群众中，已组成贫农小组或农会的及参加贫农小组或农会的数字不大，最好的诉苦教育也很少采用。现正依据这些经验大胆放手积极走群众路线，推进发动群运工作。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】解放军某部抽调大批干部下乡发动群众，并强调提出向雇贫农学习，以改造自己的思想作风。仅后勤部就抽出一百三十六人下乡。大家在出发前提出过贫农生活，与雇贫结合，组织诉苦以提高自己及群众的阶级觉悟，并在运动中学习雇贫农的坚定立场。该部司令员武承先同志首先背起背包，带领一个基点村的干部出发。参谋处长杨进同志也率领另一个组下乡。他们在村里跟雇贫农一块住，一块吃红薯、芝麻叶的窝窝和玉米、高粱糊糊，他们吃了雇贫农的饭，便把带来的粮食和菜金，全部交给农民。并在工作之余，为雇贫挑水、做杂活。
