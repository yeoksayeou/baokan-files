That fake poor peasant leagues were established in Xi’jing is not unique to Wu’an. It also happened in Xisuzhuang in Shahe and in the triangle area of southern Shanxi in Taiyue. Recently, Wenxi’s local newspaper continuously published articles about poor peasant leagues leading the fight against superstition and conducting anti-espionage activities... It can be said that none of these poor peasant leagues truly served the poor peasants, hired peasants, and the broad masses of peasants.

Poor peasant leagues must be established, and they must be established by mobilizing all the poor and hired peasants. Now, cadres from counties and districts everywhere are holding land conferences and rectifying the ranks. Why are some places so impatient? The reasons are nothing more than: First, some people are suffering from impatience. A comrade said, "I'll secretly organize it first. When you announce its establishment, my poor peasant league will be at the forefront of everything. Watch me steal the show!" Second, cadres protect each other, fearing that a real poor peasant league will target them. So they try to "strike first to gain the upper hand," ostensibly for the poor and hired peasants, but actually to suppress them. Third, landlords and rich peasants take advantage of the poor and hired peasants, seize opportunities, transform themselves, sneak into the poor peasant league, and secretly seize power to sabotage the thorough division of land by the peasants. Which category does the fake poor peasant league in Xi’jing Village belong to? We hope Wu'an will investigate. Other places where poor peasant leagues have been established should also investigate.

Our investigation and publication of the fake poor peasant league in Xi'an, Wu'an, is to provide a typical example for the entire region, to tell those comrades who are suffering from impatience, please calm down. Rushing ahead like this will not allow you to steal the show; it will only end in a "disgraceful" ending, because you are not working for the poor and hired peasants. Moreover, if you rush ahead, your work will inevitably be rough, and if it is rough, you will not be able to do things well. Even if your subjective wishes are not necessarily bad, the result will definitely be terrible. Cadres who want to protect each other and evade mass scrutiny should be honest. Knowing your mistakes and correcting them is the way out. If you make trouble now, the trick will soon be exposed, and the peasants will not agree with you. As for landlords and rich peasants, if you do not bow your heads and repent, wait for the land to be divided, and even plot a counterattack, then you are adding sin upon sin, and the people's court will judge you in the future. All those who are ambitious or have ulterior motives must be clear-headed. Organizing a fake poor peasant league is sabotaging the land law, is committing a crime. Using the masses is like playing with fire, and the fire will eventually burn you.

We hope that all the peasants in the region will unite and not be fooled. The poor peasant league is for the peasants to take charge themselves. Whoever wants to take over, manipulate, or exploit, we must boldly expose and resolutely oppose them. For our own benefit, for the thorough division of land, we will never fall into the trap of bad people and bad cadres.

### 反对成立假贫农团

    反对成立假贫农团
    西井成立假贫雇团，这种事，不仅武安有，沙河西苏庄也有，太岳晋南三角地带也有。最近闻喜小报不断登载什么贫农团领导反迷信，有的地方搞反特务………可以这样说一句：这些贫农团恐怕没有一个真正给贫雇农及广大农民办事的。
    贫农团一定要成立，那是由全体贫雇农发动起来去成立，现在各地县区干部都在开土地会议，整顿队伍，为什么有些地方就等不及了呢？原因不外：第一种是犯了急性病，有位同志说：“我先暗暗组织好，等到你一宣布成立，我的贫农团干什么都走在前头，看我出风头不？”第二种是干部互相包庇，怕成立了真正的贫农团整到自己头上，“先下手为强”，表面上是为了贫雇，实际上是打击贫雇。第三种是地主分子、富农分子利用贫雇，钻空子，摇身一变混到贫农团，暗地掌权破坏农民彻底平分。西井村假贫农团到底属于哪一类，希望武安加以检查，其他成立了贫农团的地方也应该检查。
    我们调查和发表武安西井假贫农团，为的是向全区提供一个典型例子，告诉那些犯急性病的同志，请你们冷静一些，这样抢先不会出风头，结果只能落个“灰溜溜”的下场，因为你并不是为了给贫雇办事啊。而且你要抢先，作起来必然粗糙，粗糙了一定不会把事办好，尽管你主观愿望不一定坏，但是结果一定会很糟的。想相互包庇逃避群众审查的干部应该老实一些，知错改错才是出路，现在胡闹，不久西洋镜揭穿了，农民会不答应你的。至于地主分子、富农分子，如果你们不低头悔罪，等待平分，还要阴谋反攻，就叫做罪上加罪，人民法庭将来要审判你的。一切有野心的或是心怀叵测的人都要清醒，组织假贫农团就是破坏土地法，就是犯罪，利用群众就好比玩火，将来火会烧到你们身上的。
    我们希望全区农民一致起来，不要上当，贫农团是要农民自己起来当家的，谁想包办、操纵、利用，咱们都要大胆揭发，坚决反对，为着自己的利益，为着彻底平分，咱们绝不上坏人坏干部的圈套。
