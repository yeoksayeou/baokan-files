Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS, Paris reports: The National Farmers' Conference initiated by the French Communist Party solemnly opened in Paris on the 27th "in an atmosphere of extremely high political enthusiasm." Eight hundred and fifty farmer representatives from all over France attended the meeting. In addition to farmer representatives, the presidium of the conference included members of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, such as Thorez, Duclos, and Marty. Gasan, Chairman of the Presidium, first paid tribute in his opening speech to the French farmer representatives participating in the conference to defend national interests. He then pointed out that France's national interests are currently facing unprecedented danger. The Socialist Party, together with the de Gaulle reactionaries and the Popular Republican Movement, are forcing farmers to bear heavier taxes than the old regime and are sending farmers into the hands of American reactionary capital institutions. Gasan vehemently called out, "We cannot allow our ancient country of laborers to succumb to the empire of money!" and emphatically stated that the French Communist Party will stand with the farmers and provide them with unlimited support. Rochet, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, then gave a long report, which was met with thunderous applause from the audience. Rochet first pointed out that due to the reactionary government's submission to American imperialism and its absurd policies that destroy agriculture, "France's total agricultural output in 1947 only reached 70 percent of the pre-war level." "We have not only lost bread, but we also have to seek things that can be produced domestically from abroad. At present, our agriculture is also threatened by the Mayer Plan and the entire political program of the Schuman government." Rochet said that the tax burden on poor farmers in 1948 will reach 69 billion to 77 billion francs. The Schuman government uses this to maintain huge military expenditures, attempting to use the army to oppose the people, and then harness the army like livestock onto the American war chariot in order to prepare to launch a war against the Soviet Union and nations that refuse to submit to dollar rule. Rochet emphatically stated, "The French Communist Party will, as before, fight against this plan that further impoverishes workers and peasants." Rochet concluded by saying that the policy of surrendering to American imperialism has created a threat to world peace. He declared that the movement to organize agricultural protection committees has been launched nationwide, and this organization is based on a program of struggle against Mayer's destruction of agriculture to curry favor with American expansionists. He briefly pointed out that the specific goal of the committee is: "All French farmers must unite within the agricultural protection committee to defend farmers' land, peace, and national independence."

    为保卫土地、和平、独立团结起来！
    法共召开全国农民会议
    组织农业保护委员会的运动已在全国展开
    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：由法共发起的全国农民会议，二十七日“在政治热情极高的气氛中”于巴黎隆重揭幕。出席会议的，有来自法国各地的农民代表八百五十人。大会主席团中，除农民代表外，还有法共中委多列士、杜克洛、马尔梯等人。主席团主席加善在开幕辞中，首向参加会议以保卫国家利益的法国农民代表们致敬。接着指出：目前法国的国家利益，正面临着空前的危险。社会党与戴高乐反动派和人民共和运动党一道，将比旧政权更重的租税强迫农民负担，并把农民们送到美国反动资本机构的掌心之中。加善力呼：“我们不能容许我们劳动者的古国屈服于金元帝国。”并力称：法共将与农民站在一起，并予以无限的支持。法共中委之一罗雪尔继作长篇报告，全场报以雷动的喝彩。罗氏首先指出：由于反动政府屈从美帝和毁灭农业的荒谬政策，“一九四七年法国农业总产量仅达战前水平百分之七十”。“我们不但失掉了面包，而且国内能生产的东西也不得不求之于国外。目前，我国农业亦受到迈耶计划及舒曼政府整个政治纲领的威胁。”罗氏说：一九四八年贫苦农民租税的负担，将达六百九十亿至七百七十亿法郎之巨。舒曼政府以之维持了庞大的军费，企图利用军队来反对人民，然后将军队象牲口一样套在美国战车上，以便准备发动反对苏联及拒绝屈服于美元统治的各民族的战争。罗氏力称：“法共仍将如前一样，为反对这一使工农更趋贫困的计划而奋斗”。罗氏结语说：对美帝国主义屈服的政策，造成了对全世界和平的威胁。他宣称：组织农业保护委员会的运动，已在全国展开，这个组织是根据反对迈耶毁灭农业以取媚于美扩张主义者的斗争纲领而成立的。他扼要地指出了该委员会的具体目标是：“法国全体农民为保卫农民土地、和平、及国家独立，必须在农业保护委员会内团结起来”。
