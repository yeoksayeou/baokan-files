    Middle Peasants, Don't Put on Airs
    Zhao Shuli
    Item B of Article 4 of the Supplementary Measures to the Land Law promulgated by the Border Region Government stipulates:
    The land of well-to-do middle peasants may be appropriately drawn out under the principle of drawing more to compensate for less and drawing from fertile land to compensate for barren land, but their movable property and houses shall not be touched.
    It is clearly written above that the movable property and houses of middle peasants should not be touched, but some well-to-do middle peasants, or even middle peasants who cannot be called well-to-do, have been cutting down trees, selling livestock, and eating and drinking extravagantly since hearing that the Land Law was promulgated, as if this time it will fall on their heads.
    If landlords and rich peasants do this, there is a reason for it, that is, they do not want to hand it over to the peasant association; the villagers also have a way to deal with him, because he has destroyed the fruits that the masses should have obtained and can be sent to the people's court to be convicted. Why do middle peasants do this? Maybe they heard some rumors from landlords and rich peasants, or maybe they are worrying blindly because they don't understand official affairs. What can the villagers do about these things in the future? If you say he is destroying the fruits of the masses, these things are his own, and the law stipulates that his movable property should not be touched, so naturally it should not belong to the masses; if you say he is not guilty, the middle peasants in the village who do not understand official affairs have also wasted many things following him, making people feel uneasy, and it is hard to say that he is really not guilty.
    I think these middle peasants are making a very bad bargain: the property consumed is their own, so naturally they suffer. After the land reform, other middle peasants go to plow the land, and you sell the donkey and watch others plow; the pigs of other middle peasants grow fat, and you kill the piglets early and watch others eat meat and sell money; the trees of other middle peasants grow tall, and your saplings are made into carrying poles early, watching others make beams and pillars... Seeing other middle peasants join the peasant association, you go to sign up, and people think you are stubborn and don't want you. These are still small things, if you lead with a stubborn head, many middle peasants will be fooled by you, and if people who have been fooled pursue this matter in the future, it will be even more troublesome. That's called "wasting things and not pleasing anyone," suffering on both ends.
    These middle peasant friends who are looking for trouble, don't do that again, don't go putting on airs. The policy is to closely unite all middle peasants. As long as you are indeed a middle peasant, whether rich or not, in this equal distribution of land, not a bit of your movable property will be touched. The Land Law has already provided you with a guarantee.

    中农不要外气
    赵树理
    边府公布的实行土地法补充办法第四条乙项，有这样规定：
    富裕中农的土地，得在抽多补少抽肥补瘦的原则下酌予抽出，但不得动其浮财及房屋。
    这上边明明白白写着不动中农的浮财和房子，可是有些富裕中农，或者连富裕也说不上的中农，听说土地法公布出来以后，就砍树木，卖牲口，大吃大喝，好象这一次就要弄到他头上一样。
    要是地主富农这样做，有他的原因，就是不想缴给农会；全村农民对他也有办法，因为他破坏了群众应得的果实，可以送人民法庭判罪。中农这样做是为什么呢？也许是听了地主富农的什么谣言，也许是自己摸不着公事瞎操心。将来全村农民对这些事有什么办法呢？说他是破坏群众果实吧，这些东西又是他自己的，法令上规定不准动他的浮财，自然不应归群众；说他没有罪吧，村里摸不着公事的中农跟着他也浪费了许多东西，弄得人心不安，也难说真正没罪。
    我觉着这些中农做得太不上算了：消耗的财产是自己的，自然是自己吃亏。土地改革过后，别的中农都去犁地，你把驴卖了，看人家犁；别的中农的猪长肥了，你早把小猪杀了，看人家吃肉、卖钱；别的中农的树长大了，你的小树早做了抬杆，看人家做梁做柱………看见人家别的中农入农会，你去报名，人家嫌你顽固，不要你。这些都还是小事，要是你带了个顽固头，好多中农跟着你上了当，以后人家上当的人追究起这事来，更加麻烦。那就叫“费了东西不讨好”，两头吃苦。
    这些自找苦吃的中农朋友，再不要那样做，自己找外气了。政策上是紧紧的团结全体中农，只要你确实是中农，不论富裕不富裕，在这次平分土地中间，不会动你一点浮财的，土地法上已经给你立了保状。
