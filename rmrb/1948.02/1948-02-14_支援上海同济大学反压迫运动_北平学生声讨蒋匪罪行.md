Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th: Peiping News: On the 7th of this month, over three thousand students in Peiping (reported as five thousand by the Shanghai US Associated Press) held a demonstration at Peking University campus to support the anti-oppression movement of students at Shanghai Tongji University, and to denounce the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek in creating the Tongji University bloodbath. Chiang Kai-shek dispatched military police to tightly surround the university, but the students ignored them. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely indignant, and students raised their fists and shouted slogans such as "Strive for our democratic rights." When professors gave speeches condemning the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai and urged students to awaken the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to resist, the audience responded with applause. In student speeches, it was revealed that Peking University President Hu Shih's promise to investigate the truth about Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of five Peking University students was purely a "blank check." They also denounced the president of Shanghai Tongji University as merely a "tool" of the Chiang government. Many cartoons posted at the meeting included one depicting Chiang Kai-shek's military police with hands full of blood, chasing students with American-made rifles. Students dressed up as public enemies Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Qun, Soong Tzu-wen, and Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, wrapped in bandages, limping and reporting the Northeast defeat to Chiang Kai-shek in an ugly manner. On the same day, all university campuses were plastered with slogans protesting the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai. After the meeting, students from various universities conducted fundraising to comfort the injured students in Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: Shanghai News: After the Shanghai Tongji University tragedy and the Shenxin Textile Factory massacre, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, terrified by the power of the people, are attempting to fabricate various conspiracies and excuses, and adopt bloody means to suppress the increasingly high tide of the anti-oppression struggle of Shanghai citizens. On the 3rd, the Chiang Kai-shek Songhu Garrison Command clamored to "investigate the leaders of the Shenxin Textile Factory strike and sentence them to death or life imprisonment." Fascist executioners Yi Tiewu, Wu Guozhen, and others frantically clamored that in the future, all those participating in anti-oppression actions will be shot and "killed on the spot without exception." Pan Gongzhan, speaker of the Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai Municipal Council, openly demanded that Shanghai be designated as a "martial law zone" to facilitate the unrestrained slaughter of the people of Shanghai. On the same day, after a meeting in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek appointed special agent chief Zheng Jiemin to Shanghai to make new arrangements for suppressing the people. In addition, to strengthen its reign of terror, the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek authorities have recently formed a so-called Shanghai "Public Security Promotion Committee" and are hastily drafting men to expand the security team.

    支援上海同济大学反压迫运动
    北平学生声讨蒋匪罪行
    【新华社陕北十一日电】北平消息：本月七日，平市学生三千余人（沪美联社报导为五千人），在北大校园举行示威大会，支援上海同济大学学生反压迫运动，及声讨蒋匪一手造成同济大学血案的罪行。蒋匪曾派遣军警将该校严密包围，学生毫未理睬。会场情绪异常愤激，学生们高举拳头呼喊“争取我们的民主权利”等口号。当教授们演说谴责上海蒋匪暴行，并敦促学生起来唤醒蒋区人民反抗时，全场响起一片掌声。学生发言中，揭露北大校长胡适答允调查蒋匪逮捕北大五学生真相，纯系“空头支票”。并痛斥上海同济大学校长只是蒋政府的御用“工具”。会场上张贴的许多漫画中，有一幅绘着满手血迹的蒋匪宪兵，拿着美制步枪追逐学生。学生们化装扮演人民公敌蒋介石、张群、宋子文，及蒋匪参谋长陈诚裹着绷带，一蹶一跛的向蒋介石报告东北败绩的丑态。各校校园同日均贴满抗议上海蒋匪暴行标语，会后各校学生进行募捐，慰劳上海受伤同学。
    【新华社陕北九日电】上海消息：上海同济大学惨案与申新纱厂大血案发生后，蒋匪当局震慑于人民力量的强大，正妄图制造种种阴谋借口，采用血腥手段，以镇压日益高涨的上海市民反压迫斗争。三日，蒋匪淞沪警备司令部扬言要“清查申新纱厂罢工工人领袖，处以死刑或无期徒刑”。法西斯刽子手宜铁吾、吴国桢等，竟疯狂叫嚣今后对一切参加反压迫行动之群众，将开枪射击，“当场格杀勿论”。蒋匪上海参议会议长潘公展，则公开要求划上海为“戒严区”，以更便于放手屠杀上海人民。同日匪首蒋介石于南京召集会议后，即指派特务头子郑介民赴沪，作种种镇压人民的新的布置。此外，沪市蒋匪当局为加强其恐怖统治，近已组成所谓沪市“治安促进委员会”，并匆忙抓丁扩编保安队。
