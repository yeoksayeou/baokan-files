Joint Notice from Xin Dazhong Newspaper and Postal Administration to all Post Office Station Masters:

　　The seventh issue of Xin Dazhong Newspaper contained a price increase announcement for the March issue. However, because the publication was too late and the Postal Administration was not consulted beforehand, local post offices have already begun subscribing to the March issue. If we were to collect additional fees now, many difficulties would arise. To facilitate distribution and overcome procedural chaos, it has been renegotiated: The price of Xin Dazhong Newspaper will be increased from April onwards to 350 yuan per copy per month. Starting March 1st, all subscriptions for April or later issues will be charged at the new price of 350 yuan. However, regardless of when, all subscriptions for the March issue will be charged at the original price of 200 yuan, with no increase (overpayments made at the new price should be refunded to subscribers immediately). The following specific regulations are stipulated:

　　I. All subscriptions for April or later issues already made in January and February will be honored, and no additional fees will be charged based on the new price.

　　II. However, starting March 1st, if there are still subscriptions for April or later issues made at the old price (200 yuan), the difference should be collected to bring the price up to the new price (350 yuan). Post offices must patiently explain the reasons to subscribers, work diligently, and be responsible for collecting the additional fees, with a deadline of March 20th for reporting back to the newspaper.

　　III. If, before March 1st, any March issue subscriptions were made at the new price, or if any April or later subscriptions were made at the new price after receiving the price increase announcement in the seventh issue of Xin Dazhong, the overpaid amount should be fully refunded to the subscribers, and the reasons should be explained.

　　IV. All post offices and stations must not falsely report subscription dates or overcharge or fail to refund fees, otherwise, they will be subject to punishment.

　　V. Accounting procedures for collecting additional fees and refunding fees:

　　A. When refunding overpaid fees, the subscriber should issue a receipt stating "Received from the post office, overpaid subscription fee for Xin Dazhong in the month of ××, ×× yuan exactly," with the subscriber's seal. When collecting additional fees, a receipt for the additional fees should be issued to the subscriber. All these procedures must be completed by March 20th.

　　B. Prepare three copies each of the lists of additional fees collected and fees refunded, indicating the month, number of copies, and the amount of additional fees collected and refunded. Send one copy to the General Administration, one to the District Administration, and one to the newspaper for reconciliation. The subscriber's receipt should be sent to the General Administration for verification.

　　C. For those who remit payment with four-part forms, the General Administration will verify and correct them. For those who remit payment with money orders, each post office should contact the newspaper directly to settle the overpayments and underpayments.

　　All post offices and stations should implement this notice immediately upon receipt. They must also inspect and assist all postal agencies, sales outlets, and distribution networks to ensure thorough implementation and avoid errors!

　　新大众报社  邮政总局联合通知各邮局站长：
    新大众第七期关于三月份报纸增价启事，因登载时间太晚，且未与邮总交换意见时，各地邮局已将三月份报纸订起，如再行补收报费，困难必多。为便利发行克服手续紊乱起见，兹经重新商定：新大众报纸改自四月份起增价，每份每月三百五十元。自三月一日起，凡预订四月或四月以后报纸者，一律按新价三百五十元收费。但不论何时，凡补订三月份报纸者，都按原价二百元收费，不予增加（已按新价之多收部分，应即退还订户）。并具体规定几点如下：
    一、凡一、二月份已经预订的四月或四月以后的报纸，一律照发，不再按新价补收。
    二、但自三月一日起，如仍有按旧价（二百元）预订的四月或四月以后报纸时，则应一律按新价（三百五十元）补收齐全。必须向订户耐心解释，说明原因，认真努力，负责补收，并限三月二十日结束，汇报报社。
    三、凡三月一日前，如因接到新大众第七期增价启事，即已按新价补订的三月份报纸，或按新价预订的四月及四月以后报纸者，应将多收之报价全部退还订户，并说明原因。
    四、各局站不得假报订期，额外多收或该退不退等事情，否则，须受处分。
    五、补收与退还报费的会计手续。
    甲、多收之报费退还时，由订户开具“收到邮局×月份多收之新大众订报费××元正”订户盖章之收条。如补收报费时，应给订户开具补收报费收据。均限三月二十日前办理完毕。
    乙、将补收与退还之报费，分别列表各三份，注明月份、份数、补收与退还钱数，分寄总局、区局及报社，以便对帐。并将订户收条寄总局备核。
    丙、用四联单拨付报费者，由总局核对更正。用汇票汇交报费者，由各局自行与报社接洽，多退少补。
    各局站接到本通知后，即应照办执行。并须检查帮助各邮务所、代办所、代售处、发行网等，务求贯彻而免差错为要！
    　　　　　此通知　　　　　　　　二月二十日
