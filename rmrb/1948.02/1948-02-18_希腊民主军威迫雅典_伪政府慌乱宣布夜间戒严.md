Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th -- According to broadcasts from the Free Greece Radio Station, the Greek Democratic Army continues its victorious advance, threatening Athens. A unit of the Democratic Army has advanced to the Balita residential area within 15 kilometers of the suburbs of Athens. In the victorious operations, this unit killed, wounded, and captured more than 700 enemy soldiers, and seized a large amount of US and British army equipment. In the north, a unit of the Democratic Army shelled the city of Salonika, one of the national industrial and commercial centers, at dawn on the 10th, with many shells exploding in the city. In the south, a detachment of the Democratic Army captured Pargos, a railway hub on the west coast of the Moria Peninsula. In the midwest, the Democratic Army attacked the city of Sophades in the Thessaly region. After suffering heavy casualties, the Royalist Fascist bandit troops were forced to huddle in the city. In the northwest, the Macedonian Detachment of the Democratic Army once occupied Xigvia, 20 kilometers west of the city of Kozani. In addition, the activities of the Democratic Army on the island of Crete are also increasing day by day. According to reports from British and American news agencies, as the Democratic Army threatens their lair and the Democratic Army's air force becomes increasingly active, the Athens puppet government frantically implemented "special emergency measures" in the areas under its control (including Athens), announcing a night curfew, checking pedestrians and vehicles day and night, and strengthening air defense facilities in Athens and major cities, attempting to prolong its feeble existence.

    希腊民主军威迫雅典
    伪政府慌乱宣布夜间戒严
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据自由希腊电台广播，希民主军继续胜利进军，威迫雅典。民主军一部已挺进至雅典近郊十五公里之内的巴利伊塔住宅区。该部于胜利作战中，毙伤俘敌七百余人，缴获大量美英陆军装备。在北部，民主军一部十日拂晓炮轰全国工商业中心之一的萨罗尼加城，炮弹多枚于城内爆炸。在南部，民主军某支队攻克摩里亚半岛西岸的铁路重镇帕尔哥斯。在中西部，民主军曾袭击色萨利区的索法多斯城。保皇法西斯匪军遭惨重伤亡后被迫龟缩于城中。在西北部，民主军马其顿支队一度攻占距柯萨尼城二十公里之西格维亚。此外，民主军在克里特岛上的活动亦日益加强。据英美通讯社透露，在民主军威迫其老巢与民主军空军日趋活跃的情况下，雅典伪政府慌乱地在其控制地区（包括雅典在内）实施“特别紧急措施”，宣布夜间戒严，日夜检查行人、车辆等，并加强雅典与各大城市的防空设备，妄图苟延残喘。
