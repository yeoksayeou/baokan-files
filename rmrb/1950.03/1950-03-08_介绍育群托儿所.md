　　Introducing the Yuqun Nursery
　　Zhang Shuyi
　　Since the liberation of Beijing, the number of nurseries has gradually increased, generally accepting children aged three to six, or occasionally including a few infants and toddlers. The Yuqun Private Nursery was the first to specialize in newborn infants. Infants have less resistance to germs than young children, making collective care more difficult, especially when they are cared for day and night, completely separated from their parents, requiring more individual and proper care. Under today's conditions of manpower and resources, few dare to try.

　　Ms. Liu Shuzhen, the director of the Yuqun Nursery, personally experienced the difficulties and contradictions faced by ordinary women in their work and studies after getting married and having children. During her third pregnancy, she disregarded her physical limitations and responded to the call of the All-China Women's Federation regarding children's welfare, taking out her private savings and house, running around to collect materials on nurseries and infant care methods, and independently exploring and experimenting in unfamiliar fields. After preparing for two or three months, she founded the Yuqun Nursery, specializing in newborn infants.

　　She hired two nurses and recruited several young women with middle school education, gave them two weeks of training, and began to accept five two-month-old infants, gradually increasing the number to twenty. Now the quota is full, but ninety infants have already been registered on the waiting list. This nursery has various sanitary conditions to ensure the health of the infants. The fee for each infant is 200 jin of millet (market price) per month, covering food, lodging, and clothing. In reality, in addition to covering the start-up and recurring costs, Ms. Liu needs to subsidize other expenses each month to cover all the expenses of the nursery.

　　The Yuqun Nursery is located at No. 23, Xihuying, Qianmenwai, a residential courtyard house, decorated quite neatly and beautifully. In the five infant rooms, besides the necessary items for infants such as small beds and small wardrobes, there is no cluttered furniture. The temperature in the room is often around 60 degrees, with plenty of air and sunshine. The courtyard is neatly hung with the infants' clean white diapers and small clothes. The staff, like the director, speak softly, and the infants grow up in this gentle and peaceful environment.

　　The Yuqun Nursery strives to take care of the health of each infant. Infants must undergo an examination by a designated pediatrician and hold a doctor's certificate before being admitted. After admission, they must undergo a period of isolation before they can be with other infants. Food and utensils are strictly disinfected. The preparation of milk and the addition of complementary foods are guided by pediatricians. Caregivers must be certified as healthy by a doctor before they can work. The infants' mothers and visitors are not allowed to enter the infant rooms and have contact with the children. When the infants' mothers come to visit on Sundays, they must wear isolation gowns. In order for each infant to receive individual affection, the caregivers often pick up the children and make them laugh; on sunny days, they take them outdoors every day to absorb sunlight and fresh air.

　　Under the efforts of Director Liu and all the staff, this nursery has made preliminary achievements today and has gained the trust of parents. But there are still many difficulties. Among them, according to Director Liu, the biggest is how to lead all the staff to serve the children wholeheartedly. That is, how to improve everyone's political consciousness and the spirit of taking responsibility automatically. Since the opening of the nursery half a year ago, Director Liu has deeply felt that she needs to work hard in her political studies and get help. Therefore, she suggested to the Children's Welfare Department of the Beijing Women's Federation to open political lectures for on-the-job nursery staff. After the lectures started, she was one of the loyal listeners. She felt that simply improving the staff's treatment may not necessarily improve work efficiency. On the contrary, under the supply system, many cadres, although living a hard life, are more responsible than some staff members with high salaries. Therefore, she realized that only by combining politics and work and promoting the whole nursery to work in this direction can we overcome difficulties and run the nursery well.

　　In her half-year of work experience, Director Liu felt that a nursery should cooperate with the entire cause to exert greater strength. In addition to planning to expand and consolidate the Yuqun Nursery and take in more infants, she also encouraged others to contribute money and effort, or to run nurseries themselves or jointly with the public sector. First, she helped her sister, Liu Shuying, to jointly run an organization nursery with the China Youth Art Theater. Her sister is responsible for the start-up and equipment costs and assumes the position of director on a voluntary basis. The theater is responsible for the monthly recurring expenses of the nursery. In order to serve more children, she plans to donate a sum of money to the Beijing Women's Federation and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to run children's welfare undertakings.

　　Ms. Liu Shuzhen's spirit of serving children should be promoted. She has set an example for ordinary women who have the money and conditions to serve children. It is hoped that more people in society can take out private savings, real estate, and skills to run public welfare undertakings, cooperate with the entire country's production and construction work, and open more nurseries according to needs and local specific conditions, solve the problems of most mothers and children, and cultivate new and healthy generations.

### 介绍育群托儿所

　　介绍育群托儿所
    张淑义
    北京解放后，托儿所日渐增加，一般都收三岁到六岁的幼儿或兼收少数的婴儿乳儿。专收初生婴儿的是从私立育群托儿所开始的。婴儿抵抗病菌的能力比幼儿小，集体教养比较困难，特别是日夜托、完全离开父母，更需要个别的妥善的照顾。在今日人力物力的条件下，很少人敢于尝试。
    育群托儿所所长刘淑珍女士曾经亲身体验到一般妇女结婚生孩子后，工作、学习上发生的困难与矛盾。她在第三次怀孕期间，便不顾体力的限制，响应全国妇联关于儿童保育事业的号召，拿出私人的积蓄和房子，到处奔走，搜集有关托儿所及婴儿保育法的材料，独自在不熟悉的业务上摸索、尝试，准备了两三个月的时间，创办了专收初生婴孩的育群托儿所。
    她聘请了两位护士，并招考了几个中学程度的青年妇女，加以两周的训练，就开始招收二个月大的婴儿五名，分期增加，直到二十名为止。现在名额已满，但等候入所而登记了的婴儿已有九十名了。这个托儿所具备各种卫生条件，以求保证婴儿的健康。每个婴儿的费用是每月伏地小米价二百斤，供食宿和服装。实际上，刘女士除负担开办和经常费用外，每月皆需补贴其他费用，才够支付全所的开支。
    育群托儿所在前门外西湖营二十三号，一所住宅式的四合房，布置得相当整洁美观。五间婴儿室内，除婴儿必需用具如小床，小衣柜等外，没有杂乱家具。室内的温度常在六十度左右，空气阳光充足。院子里整整齐齐地挂着婴儿的洁白尿布和小衣服。工作人员和所长一样地轻声细语，婴儿们就在这种温和而平静的环境中成长起来。
    育群托儿所尽力照顾每个婴儿的健康。婴儿入所必须经过指定的儿科医生检查，持医生证明书始可入所。入所后还必须经过一个时期的隔离，才能和其他婴儿在一起。饮食及用具皆经过严密的消毒。牛奶的配制和辅食品的增加都经过儿科医生的指导。保育员必须经过医生证明健康，才能工作。婴儿的母亲和参观的人不能进入婴儿室和孩子们接触。每星期日婴儿的母亲来看望时，须穿上隔离衣。为了使每个婴儿得到个别的抚爱，保育员要常常把孩子抱起，逗他们说笑；晴天时，每天都带他们到室外去吸取阳光和新鲜空气。
    这个托儿所在刘所长和全体工作人员的努力下，今天已做出了初步的成绩，得到了家长们的信任。但还有着很多困难。其中最大的，据刘所长说，是怎样领导全体工作人员全心全意为儿童服务。也就是怎样提高大家的政治觉悟，和自动负责的精神。该所开办半年以来，刘所长深感自己在政治上需要努力学习和得到帮助，因此她曾向北京市妇联儿童福利部建议开办托儿所在职人员的政治讲座。讲座开办起来以后，她是忠实听众之一。她感觉到单单提高工作人员的待遇，并不一定能够使工作效率提高。相反，在供给制下，许多干部虽然过着艰苦的生活，却比高薪下的一些工作人员更为负责。因此她认识到只有政治与业务结合起来，推动全所向这方面努力，才能战胜困难，把托儿所办好。
    刘所长在半年的工作经历中，感到一个托儿所应和整个的事业配合起来才能发挥更大的力量。她除了计划把育群托儿所扩大并巩固起来，多收一些婴儿外，同时推动其他的人出钱出力，或自办或与公家合办托儿所。首先她帮助妹妹刘淑英与中国青年艺术剧院合办了一个机关托儿所。她妹妹负责开办及设备费，并尽义务担任所长职。剧院则负责托儿所每月的经常费用。她为了能给更多的儿童服务，准备捐出一笔款子交北京市妇联及全国民主妇联兴办儿童福利事业。
    刘淑珍女士这种为儿童服务的精神是应该发扬的。她给一般有钱有条件为儿童服务的妇女们做出了一个榜样。希望社会上能有更多的人拿出私人积蓄、房产和技能来办公益事业，配合整个国家的生产建设工作。同时又根据需要和各地具体的情况，开办更多的托儿所，解决大多数母亲与孩子的问题，培育新生的健康的后代。
