　　The Golden Swallow
    A Mongolian Fairy Tale
    The fierce bird king Hangade summoned a wasp and ordered it:
    "Fly over the land and identify whose blood is the sweetest. But be careful, don't tell anyone why I'm asking you to do this."
    The wasp flew across the land and tasted everyone's blood. Then it flew back to the bird king Hangade.
    On the way back, the wasp met a swallow.
    "Where are you coming from? Where are you going?" the swallow asked the startled wasp. "Answer me immediately!"
    "Oh," the wasp thought, "now the swallow is going to eat me, I have to tell it the secret."
    So, the wasp said:
    "Bird King Hangade ordered me to identify whose blood is the sweetest. I tasted the blood of every living thing and determined that human blood is the sweetest."
    The swallow understood what fate awaited humanity. So, it pulled out the wasp's tongue.
    They flew together to the bird king. The bird king was waiting for the wasp to speak to it. But it just flew around in front of him: "Buzz—buzz—buzz."
    The bird king was angry and shouted loudly:
    "Well, speak! What did you find?"
    The wasp just buzzed more vigorously. The bird king asked the swallow:
    "Swallow, tell me, perhaps you can understand what the wasp is saying."
    The clever swallow replied:
    "The wasp says that snake blood is the sweetest."
    From then on, the bird king often pecked at snakes.
    The swallow rescued humanity and became a beloved bird. Therefore, it is not without reason that people say swallows bring happiness.
    Humans and swallows formed such a friendship: the swallow is close to people, often touching their clothes with its wings. The swallow seems to be reminding people not to forget the happiness it brought to mankind. (Translated by Lin Yang from the Soviet magazine "Ogonyok," 1949, No. 48)

　　金色的燕子
    蒙古的童话
    厉害的鸟王汉加德把黄蜂叫来，命令它道：
    “去地面上飞，辨认出谁的血最甘美。注意，对谁也不要说我为什么差你这样做。”
    黄蜂飞遍了整个土地，无论谁的血都尝过了。它便飞回鸟王汉加德那里。
    在归途上，黄蜂遇到了燕子。
    “你从那里来？要到那里去？”燕子问着受惊的黄蜂：“立刻回答我！”
    “呶，”黄蜂思虑着：“现在燕子要来吃我了，我得对它说出机密。”
    于是，黄蜂说：
    “鸟王汉加德命令我辨识谁的血最甘美。我尝过了任何一个活的东西的血，确定了人的血是最甘美的。”
    燕子明白了人类将遭受到怎样的命运。于是，它拔掉了黄蜂的舌头。
    它们一齐向着鸟王那里飞去。鸟王在等待着黄蜂对它说话。而它却只是在它面前飞着：“嗡——嗡——嗡。”
    鸟王生气了，大声地叫道：
    “呶，快说呀，你辨别到什么了？”
    黄蜂却仍只是更用劲地嗡嗡作响。鸟王便询问燕子：
    “燕子，你说吧，你也许能明白黄蜂说的什么。”
    灵巧的燕子回答道：
    “黄蜂说，毒蛇的血最甘美。”
    从那时起，鸟王便时常啄食着毒蛇。
    燕子解救了人类，成了人类心爱的禽鸟。因此，人们说燕子带来幸福，这并不是没有原因的。
    人与燕子结成了这样的朋友：燕子亲近人们，常将它的翅膀几乎触到人们的衣裳。燕子好像在提醒人们，叫人们不要忘记它给人类带来的幸福。（林扬译自苏联《火星》杂志一九四九年四八期）
