Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: TASS, Sofia reports: The Sofia Prosecutor's Office announced in late February the indictment of American spies and Bulgarian citizens Shipkov, Lindova, Kratonkov, Sanov, and Marchev. The above five individuals are accused of supplying political, economic, and military intelligence to American intelligence agencies directly supervised by U.S. Minister to Sofia, Donald Heath, thereby endangering national security, and of attempting to cross the border illegally and forging official documents. The following is a summary of the indictment:

Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has consistently attempted to turn the Balkan Peninsula into an American colony, and has successively used figures such as Gemeto and Nikola Petkov to engage in illegal activities in Bulgaria. Petkov, under the direction of American Political Representative to Bulgaria, Barnes, established an opposition center, conspiring to overthrow the Fatherland Front government by force. After these conspiracies were crushed and Petkov was arrested, Barnes had to leave Bulgaria, and his successor was Heath. Their activities were confirmed in the 1949 Evangelical Church clergy case and the Kostov case. Now, it has once again been confirmed that American intelligence agencies used their official representatives stationed in Bulgaria to recruit Shipkov and others to engage in espionage activities.

	Heath Arranges Shipkov's Escape, Ultimately Captured
Defendant Shipkov once served as a liaison officer for the British Military Mission of the Allied Control Commission. He participated in the opposition center and actively opposed the Fatherland Front government. He became acquainted with American Political Representative to Bulgaria, Barnes. Later, Shipkov served as a translator at the American Legation, and he handed over to American intelligence agencies all intelligence regarding the productivity and labor force of the Benick coal mine and the situation of Bulgarian industry, and carried out Heath's instructions to spread rumors, attempting to create inappropriate sentiment among the public. On August 20th of last year, government agencies warned him to stop the slander campaign. Heath, because Shipkov had been exposed, hid him in the attic of the American Legation, and on September 21st of last year sent a note to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the issuance of an exit passport for Shipkov. On January 11th of this year, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the American Legation, pointing out that their hiding of Shipkov violated international conventions, and demanded that Shipkov be handed over, but Heath arranged for Shipkov's illegal escape. According to Shipkov's confession: "The First Secretary of the American Legation, Courtney, handed me forged identity cards, fake medical certificates, and poison on February 10th, ordering me to illegally cross the Turkish border, after which I would be protected by Americans. Courtney said to me: If I am arrested while trying to escape, I should take the poison, and my body will not arouse suspicion, because the medical certificate I carry has materials explaining that I am mentally unsound." At midnight on February 11th, the defendant was driven away by Courtney in a car, but was finally arrested on February 14th.

	Lindova Supplies Military Intelligence to the American Military Mission
The second defendant, Lindova, worked as a telephone operator at the American Military Mission. In the summer of 1946, Lindova gave intelligence about Bulgarian airfields to U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Stancy of the American Military Mission, and she spread rumors that the Bulgarian government would be overthrown. Lindova also supplied intelligence about Macedonia to Colonel Wald, and political and economic intelligence about Pleven, various branches of the Bulgarian armed forces, airfields near Pleven, the number of militiamen and the organizational charter of the militia and the army, and intelligence about the Bukov mine to American Naval Attaché Gibbs. On October 30, 1949, Lindova and Kratonkov left Sofia together, planning to cross the border and flee to Greece. However, they were arrested by government agencies on the border on November 5.

The third defendant, Kratonkov, was a member of the fascist organization Brianniek and the secretary of the Socialist Opposition Association. He was introduced by Lindova to establish contact with American intelligence agencies, and collected for them the most detailed intelligence about the mines in Bukov village and intelligence about the Dimitrov locomotive factory.

The fourth defendant, Sanov, was a member of the fascist organization Brianniek. He established contact with American intelligence agencies through Kratonkov and collected intelligence about the mines in Bukov village for them.

The fifth defendant, Marchev, maintained contact with American Legation Counselor Burke until his arrest in January 1950.

The above defendants have been handed over to the judicial authorities for trial.

　　美帝破坏活动又一次惨败
    保公布对美间谍起诉书   
    西普考夫等受美使希斯指挥供给各种情报危害国家安全
    【新华社北京五日电】据塔斯社索非亚讯：索非亚检察署于二月下旬公布对美国间谍、保加利亚公民西普考夫、林多瓦、克拉顿考夫、萨诺夫及马尔切夫的起诉书。上列五人被控犯有以政治、经济及军事情报供给受美国驻索非亚公使唐纳·希斯直接监督的美国情报机关，从而危害国家安全，及企图私越国界，伪造官方文件等罪。起诉书摘要如下：
    第二次世界大战结束以后，美帝国主义一直企图变巴尔干半岛为美国的殖民地，曾先后利用了杰姆脱和尼古拉·彼特科夫等人在保加利亚从事非法活动。彼特科夫曾在美国驻保政治代表巴恩斯的指挥下成立了反对派中心，阴谋以暴力推翻祖国阵线政府。在这些阴谋被扑灭，彼特科夫被捕后，巴恩斯不得不离开保加利亚，他的继任人便是希斯。在一九四九年福音教会教士案和科斯托夫案的审判中，曾证实了他们的活动。现在，又一次证实了美国谍报机关曾利用其驻保官方代表招雇西普考夫等人从事间谍活动。
            希斯为西普考夫布置潜逃终被捕获
    被告西普考夫曾任盟国管制委员会英国军事代表团的联络官。他曾参加过反对派中心，积极反对祖国阵线政府。他结识了美国驻保加利亚政治代表巴恩斯。其后，西普考夫在美国公使馆充任翻译员，他把贝尼克煤矿的生产力、劳动力的情形和保加利亚工业情况的全部情报交给了美国谍报机关，并执行希斯的指令，散布谣言，企图在公众间制造不妥的情绪。去年八月二十日，政府机关曾警告他，要他停止诽谤运动。希斯因西普考夫业已暴露，便把他藏在美国公使馆的阁楼上，并在去年九月二十一日照会保加利亚外交部，要求颁发出境护照给西普考夫。今年一月十一日，保加利亚外交部照会美国公使馆，指出他们匿藏西普考夫违反国际公约，并要求把西普考夫交出来，但希斯却布置了西普考夫的非法潜逃。据西普考夫供称：“美国公使馆一等秘书考尔特尼二月十日交给我伪造的身份证、假诊断书和毒药等，要我非法越过土耳其边境，以后即有美国人保护我。考尔特尼对我说：假如我在试图逃跑时被捕了，我便服毒，我的躯体将不会引起怀疑，因为我带着的诊断书上有说明我精神不正常的材料。”二月十一日午夜，被告由考尔特尼驾汽车送走，但终于在二月十四日被捕。
            林多瓦以军事情报供给美国军事使团
    第二名被告林多瓦，她在美国军事使团充当电话生。一九四六年夏，林多瓦把关于保加利亚飞机场的情报交给美国军事使团的斯坦西空军中校，她并散播谣言，说保加利亚政府将被推翻。林多瓦又曾以有关马其顿的情报供给华尔德上校，并以有关普列文的政治与经济情报，保国武装部队的各兵种，普列文附近的飞机场，民兵的数目和民兵与陆军的组织章程，和布霍沃矿山等情报供给美国海军武官吉勃斯。一九四九年十月三十日，林多瓦和克拉顿考夫一同离开索非亚，计划越出国境逃往希腊。但于十一月五日在边境被政府机关逮捕。
    第三名被告克拉顿考夫，曾为法西斯组织布里安聂克的成员，社会主义反对派协会的书记。他由林多瓦介绍与美国谍报机关建立联系，为它们搜集了关于布霍沃村各矿山最详细的情报及有关季米特洛夫机车制造厂情况的情报。
    第四名被告萨诺夫，曾为法西斯组织布里安聂克的成员。他通过克拉顿考夫而与美国谍报机关建立联系，并为其搜集布霍沃村各矿山的情报。
    第五名被告马尔切夫，他和美国公使馆参赞勃尔克保持联系，直到一九五○年一月被捕时为止。
    上列被告已交付司法当局审判。
