Xinhua News Agency, 21st: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 20th, while the US Seventh Fleet was stationed in Saigon, over five thousand students from Saigon's universities, middle schools, and elementary schools held a large-scale demonstration on the 19th to protest the increasingly intensified collusion between American and French imperialists. Demonstrations were held simultaneously in all districts of the city. The demonstrating students shouted, "Oppose American aid to French colonialists!" "Execute the traitors!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!" Many flags of the United States, France, and the Bao Dai regime were torn down by the demonstrators, and the flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam flew over all the main thoroughfares. The portrait of Bao Dai hanging in front of the City Hall was also torn down by the demonstrating masses. When a large crowd followed the demonstrators towards the pier where the American warships were anchored, the police opened fire on the demonstrators. According to a Reuters dispatch from Saigon on the 19th, the demonstrators blocked the police with cars and other objects and confronted the police with bricks and bottles. French troops used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, resulting in four deaths, forty injuries, and several arrests.

Another dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Saigon, on the 19th and 20th: Saigon students held a strike on the 20th after the tragedy. The student committee is preparing for the funeral to bury the students who sacrificed themselves in the demonstration. In order to prevent the exposure of this bloody atrocity, the French authorities ordered six Vietnamese newspapers in Saigon to cease publication on the 20th because they refused to obey the French authorities' order prohibiting the publication of news about the demonstration.

　　抗议美法侵略越南
    西贡学生大示威
    越南共和国国旗到处飘扬
    法帝竟杀伤游行学生四十余人
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十日消息：当美国第七舰队逗留西贡期间，西贡大、中、小学学生五千余人于十九日举行了大规模的游行示威，抗议美、法帝国主义者的日益加紧的勾结。示威同时在全市各区举行。示威学生高呼“反对美国对法国殖民者的援助！”“处死卖国贼！”“胡志明主席万岁！”美国、法国及保大政权的许多旗帜都被示威者撕毁，越南民主共和国的国旗飘扬在一切通衢大道上。悬挂在市政厅门前的保大画像，也被示威群众撕毁。当大批群众跟随在示威者后面，走向美国军舰碇泊的码头时，警察开枪射击示威群众。据路透社西贡十九日电，示威群众以汽车等物阻挡警察，并以砖头和瓶子和警察对抗。法国军队用催泪性毒气驱散示威群众，结果有四人被杀，四十人受伤，若干人被捕。
    另据法新社西贡十九、二十两日消息：西贡学生在惨案发生后，于二十日举行罢课。学生委员会正在着手筹备葬仪，安葬在示威中牺牲的同学。法国当局为了防止这次血腥暴行的暴露，已于二十日勒令西贡六家越文报纸停刊，原因是他们拒绝服从法国当局关于禁止刊载示威消息的命令。
