Wanping Yeshi Village Party Cadres Seriously Complete Village Political Power Election
	The Chinese Communist Party cadres of Yeshi Village, Wanping Second District, had a muddled understanding of the democratic movement and the united front ideology, and generally harbored resistance to the election work of the village political power. It was only after the county party committee's work team conducted in-depth publicity and education that this was reversed. Starting from March 12th, the work team went deep among the masses to carry out village election propaganda, and on the 20th, victoriously elected the people's representatives and elected the Village People's Government Committee.
	The main responsible cadres of the village, such as the secretary of the CCP branch and the village head, originally held the erroneous idea of "taking a rest" and "changing positions" at the beginning. Therefore, after returning from a meeting in the district, not only did they not earnestly convey and discuss the important matter of the village election, but they unanimously adhered to the idea of a "major change of personnel," and planned a batch of non-Party member candidates in advance. After the meeting, Party member cadres also deliberated among the masses, telling them not to elect Party members as representatives. The old village head, Tan Zhaolin, and the branch propaganda committee member, Li Guochen, even threatened the masses, saying: "Don't elect us, if you elect us, be careful we'll be rude to you!" "Whoever elects me is my enemy, is harming me!" They also colluded inside and outside the Party, telling people to elect those who used to pick faults as representatives. As a result, the masses had no idea about the election. Some people held the attitude of "electing whoever they are told to elect."
	Later, the work team went to the village to understand the situation in depth among the masses. After analyzing and studying the thinking of the Party members, they convened a general meeting of all Party members of the branch. At the meeting, in light of the ideological situation of the Party members, they repeatedly explained the basic spirit and great significance of this democratic movement, and focused on conducting ideological education on democracy and the united front. They sternly pointed out that the idea of "retirement" was wrong, and that it violated the basic principle that Communist Party members must struggle for the cause of communism to the end. They also repeatedly explained the provincial government's instructions on the election of three-level people's congresses and the provisional organizational regulations for village people's congresses and village people's governments, thus gradually reversing the various erroneous ideas of the Party members. For example, Party member Li Guochen said: "This time I understand, we must abide by the oath of joining the Party, and we must never retreat halfway." He also said: "This will be easy to handle in the future! The masses of the whole village will manage major affairs, and it will no longer be a few cadres doing everything! In the past, a few cadres babbled and spent a lot of energy on useless efforts, but they didn't do things well. This time, we can discuss things with the masses, and things will be easier to handle. If I am elected as a representative, I will feel honored!" The close-doorism of Party members who were unwilling to discuss matters with non-Party members began to be overcome, and they also began to attach importance to the village election work. They specifically discussed the qualifications of representatives: to be fair in handling affairs, not selfish or self-interested, not arbitrary, able to unite people, have plans for doing things, have a correct style, not only do a good job in labor, but also be able to lead the masses to do a good job in production.
	Next, the branch used various methods such as wall newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, children's disguised propaganda, and street performances to conduct extensive propaganda among the masses. In particular, Party members conducted individual propaganda by visiting homes, which was very effective. Various erroneous ideas among the masses, such as doubts about democracy, "following the wind," and thinking that "the Party's decision counts," were also gradually reversed. Of the 187 citizens in the village, 146 enthusiastically participated in the election (most of those who did not participate were not at home). At the election meeting, it was decided to nominate candidates by comparing qualifications, and everyone was very serious. For example, at the beginning, Liu Zhengming nominated Liu Jinlu, saying that he was selfless, and Han Sirong took over and said: "Don't say nouns, you have to say facts!" Military family member Han Laobo made a good introduction when he nominated Liu Jinquan (model worker), he said: "Old Han does a good job in labor, and can also motivate others. He is a model in the work of substitute cultivation. Last year, he did the work of two people for my family." When someone proposed to elect worker family member Liu Yongtian, they said: "He is more than sixty years old this year, and he doesn't need substitute cultivation workers for all the work he can do himself. Last year, he was assigned eighty substitute cultivation workers, and he automatically reduced it by forty. Under his leadership, the whole village saved a lot of substitute cultivation workers." In addition, some people not only put forward advantages when nominating candidates, but also put forward individual shortcomings, such as when nominating Tan Zhaolin (the original village head), they said: "He is straightforward, serious in his work, and put in a lot of effort in organizing the masses to plant wheat last autumn. When the superiors assigned work, he couldn't sleep and tried to complete it. But he also has a shortcoming, that is, he is impatient and likes to throw 'attitude'." When someone nominated Li Wenru, after discussion, everyone believed that although he was honest, he could not lead the work and was too timid, and as a result, he was not elected. Under such a serious election, not only were the cadres identified, but the masses were also educated. As a result, fifteen representatives were elected, all of whom were unanimously supported by everyone. The People's Representative Conference is now making production plans for the whole village and actively preparing for spring plowing.

### 宛平碣石村党员干部认真完成村政权选举

　　宛平碣石村党员干部认真完成村政权选举
    宛平二区碣石村中共党员干部，由于对民主运动、统一战线思想认识糊涂，对村政权的选举工作普遍存有抵抗思想。经过县委工作组深入宣传教育，才扭转过来。从三月十二日开始，工作组深入群众，开展村选宣传，于二十日胜利的选出了人民代表，并选出了村人民政府委员会。
    该村中共支部书记及村长等主要负责干部，在开始时，原来都抱着“休息”“换一换”的错误想法。所以由区上开会回来，不但没有对村选这件大事进行认真传达讨论，反一致本着“大换班”的想法，事先计划了一批非党员的候选人。会后党员干部并在群众中酝酿，不叫选党员当代表。旧村长谭朝林和支部宣传委员李国臣竟威胁群众说：“你们别选我们，选上我们，可小心对你们不客气！”“谁选我，就是和我有仇，就是害我呢！”又在党内外串通，叫选过去爱挑斜疵的人当代表。这样一来，闹的群众对选举也就没了主意。一部分人就抱着“叫选谁就选谁”的态度。
    后来工作组到该村深入群众了解了情况，对党员思想进行分析研究后，就召开了支部全体党员大会。会上针对党员思想情况，反复说明这次民主运动的基本精神与重大意义，并着重进行了民主教育与统一战线的思想教育。严正指出“退休”思想是错误的，是和共产党员要为共产主义事业奋斗到底的基本原则相违背的。又把省府关于选举三级人民代表大会的指示及村人民代表大会与村人民政府暂行组织通则等文件反复讲解，这样逐渐扭转了党员的各种错误思想：如党员李国臣说：“这回可想通了，咱们一定要遵守入党誓词，决不能中途退却。”又说：“这以后就好办了！全村群众都来管大事，再不是几个干部包办了！以前几个干部瞎咕咕，花点子穷工夫，劲也没少费，事也没办好。这回有事和群众商量，事情就好办了。要选上我当代表，我还觉得光荣呢！”党员不愿和党外人士商量事情的关门主义的思想开始克服了，对村选工作也就重视起来。并具体讨论了代表条件：要办事公平，不自私自利，不独断专行，能团结人，办事有计划，作风正派，不但劳动好，并能领导群众搞好生产。
    接着，支部又利用墙报、屋顶广播、儿童化装宣传、街头演剧等各种方式，在群众中进行广泛的宣传。特别是党员以串门的方式，进行个别宣传，收效很大。群众中对民主怀疑、“随风倒”及认为“党决定了就算”等各种错误思想，也逐渐扭转过来了。全村一百八十七个公民，有一百四十六人都热烈参加了选举（没参加的多半是不在家的）。在选举大会上，决定用比条件的方法提候选人，大家都非常认真。例如开始时，刘正明提出刘进禄说他大公无私，韩思荣就接过去说：“别说名词，得说实事！”军属韩老波提出刘进权（劳动模范）时也做了很好的介绍，他说：“老韩劳动好，还能带动别人，他是代耕工作中的模范，去年给我家代耕，一天做了两个人的活。”有人提出选工属刘永田时说：“他今年六十多岁，凡是自己能干了的活，完全不用代耕工。去年给他确定八十个代耕工，他自动减去了四十个。在他带动下，全村节省了很多代耕工。”此外，有的提候选人时不但提出优点，还提出个别缺点，如提出选谭朝林（原来的村长）时说：“他心眼直爽，工作认真，去秋组织群众种麦，出了很大力气。上级布置下工作，睡不着觉，也想法把他完成。可是他还有一个缺点，就是性子暴躁，爱闹‘态度’。”当有人提出李文儒时，经过讨论，大家认为他虽然老实但不能领导工作，胆子太小，结果没选上。在这样认真选举之下，不但鉴定了干部，而且也教育了群众，结果选出了十五名代表，都是大家一致拥护的。现人民代表会正做全村生产计划，积极准备春耕。
