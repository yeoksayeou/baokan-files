    Strengthen the unity and cooperation between Communist Party members and democratic figures, as well as the broad masses
    The CPC Central Committee instructs the entire party
    to study the document "Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communist Party Members Being Good at Uniting and Cooperating with Non-Party Masses"
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 25th] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently issued instructions requiring Party committees at all levels and all Party members to study the document entitled "Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communist Party Members Being Good at Uniting and Cooperating with Non-Party Masses" in order to strengthen the unity and cooperation between Communist Party members and democratic figures, as well as the broad non-Party masses. The full text of the instructions is as follows: To all Party committees and all Communist Party members!
    We are here specially re-publishing two passages from Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong as study material for all Party members at present. These two passages explain why Communist Party members should be closely united with non-Party members, and how to achieve close unity with non-Party members. Our Party has achieved great success in the work of closely uniting with non-Party members. Without the faithful implementation of the Party's instructions by the vast majority of Party members, uniting millions of non-Party members to work together, it would be unimaginable to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, it should be pointed out that in Party organizations in various localities, some Party members, especially those bearing considerable leadership responsibilities, are still committing the mistake of closing-doorism by putting on airs as Party members, flaunting their revolutionary seniority, and being unwilling or unable to cooperate with non-Party masses and democratic figures, thereby harming the people's cause. Now we are re-publishing these two passages from Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong with the aim of having all Party comrades, especially those committing the mistake of closing-doorism, earnestly study them and conduct self-criticism accordingly, so as to overcome the shortcomings in the unity and cooperation between our Party members and the non-Party masses, and to strengthen this cooperation.
          The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　加强共产党员和民主人士及广大群众的团结合作
    中共中央指示全党
    学习《斯大林毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作》的文件
    【新华社二十五日讯】中国共产党中央委员会顷发布指示，要求中共各级党委员会和全体党员学习题为《斯大林毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作》的文件，以加强共产党员和民主人士及广大的非党群众的团结合作。指示全文如下：各级党委及全体共产党员同志们！
    我们在这里特地重新发表斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的两段文章，作为当前全体党员学习的一种材料。这两段文字是说明共产党员为什么应当与非党员亲密团结，和怎样与非党员达到亲密团结的。我们的党，在与非党员亲密团结这一工作上，是有很大成绩的。没有绝大多数党员忠实地执行党的指示，团结着千百万非党员在一道工作，要把国民党反动派打倒，是不可想像的。但是，应该指出，在各地党的组织里，有一部分党员，特别是负相当领导责任的党员，仍然犯着向党外群众摆党员架子，摆革命老资格，不愿或不善于和党外群众与民主人士合作的关门主义的毛病，并因此而使人民的事业受到损害。现在我们把斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的两段文章重行发表，目的就是要全党同志特别是犯有关门主义毛病的同志，认真地加以学习，并据以进行检讨，以便克服我们党员和党外群众团结合作中的缺点，并把这一合作加强起来。
          中国共产党中央委员会
            一九五○年三月二十五日
