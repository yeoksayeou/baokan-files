[This newspaper dispatch] The offices of the People's Bank of China in Changzhi Prefecture and its subordinate branches in Lucheng, Yangcheng, Changzhi, Huguan and other counties are actively issuing agricultural loans to support spring plowing and increase production. After the prefecture office convened a meeting of branch managers from the entire region on March 3rd, it deployed spring loan work according to the spirit of the meeting. It successively issued loans for agricultural tools and breeding livestock through the county supply and marketing cooperatives. The Lucheng branch, in coordination with the county government and the county supply and marketing cooperative, specifically studied the matter and issued loans of 7.95 million yuan and 7,000 jin of millet. The county supply and marketing cooperative used the funds to purchase agricultural tools, including 100 seed drills and 600 plowshares. Loans for water conservancy and breeding livestock are also being issued. The original task for breeding livestock loans at the Yangcheng branch was for eight animals, and seven have already been loaned out.

The water conservancy loans are issued jointly by a water conservancy group composed of the branch, the county cooperative, the county government's agricultural section, and the water conservancy section to the key areas. Breeding livestock loans are planned to focus on the Fourth and Fifth Districts, organizing two breeding stations. This is currently being specifically organized.
