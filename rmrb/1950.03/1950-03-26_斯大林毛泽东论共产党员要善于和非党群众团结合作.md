Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists Being Good at Uniting and Cooperating with Non-Party Masses.

　　Comrade Stalin said in his speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers on February 19, 1933: "Now let me say a few individual opinions.

　　First of all, let’s talk about the Party members in our countryside. There are many Party members among you, but there are even more non-Party members. There are more non-Party members participating in this conference than Party members, which is a good phenomenon. Because we must first absorb non-Party members to participate in our cause. Some Communist Party members treat non-Party collective farmers with a Bolshevik attitude. However, some Communist Party members pride themselves on their Party membership and do not allow non-Party members to approach them. This is bad and harmful. The reason why the Bolsheviks are powerful, and the reason why the Communist Party members are powerful, is that they are good at uniting millions of non-Party activists around our Party. If we Bolsheviks had not been able to make millions of non-Party workers and peasants trust our Party, we would not have the victory we have today. But how can we achieve this? To achieve this, Party members must not be isolated from non-Party members, must not live in seclusion, must not pride themselves on their Party membership, but must listen to the opinions of non-Party members, not only to teach non-Party members, but also to learn from non-Party members.

　　Don't forget that Party members don't fall from the sky. Remember that all Party members themselves have become Party members from non-Party members. Today they are non-Party members, and tomorrow they will become Party members. What is there to be proud of? Among our old Bolsheviks, there are many comrades who have worked in the Party for two or thirty years. And we ourselves once were not Party members. If the Party members at that time despised us and did not allow us to approach the Party twenty or thirty years ago, what would have happened to us? We might have been outside the Party for a few more years. But, comrades, we old Bolsheviks are not the most useless people.

　　Precisely because of this, our Party members, our current young Party members who sometimes look down on non-Party members, should remember all of this. It should be remembered that what makes the Bolsheviks shine is not pride, but humility." (Leninism Issues, Moscow, 1949 Chinese Edition, pages 556-557.)

　　Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly on November 21, 1941:

　　"Some Communist Party members are still not good at practicing democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and still retain a narrow closed-doorism or sectarianism erroneous thinking. They still do not understand that Communist Party members have the obligation to cooperate with non-Party members and have no right to exclude non-Party members. This is the principle of listening to the opinions of the masses, connecting with the masses, and not being divorced from the masses. There is a clause in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's program of governance, stipulating that Communist Party members should practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members and must not act arbitrarily, monopolize, or take over everything, which is to prevent those comrades who do not yet understand the Party's policies. Communist Party members must listen to the opinions of non-Party members and give others the opportunity to speak. If others are right, we should welcome them and learn from them. If others are wrong, we should also let others finish speaking, and then slowly explain to them. Communist Party members must never be self-righteous, arrogant, thinking that they are good at everything and others are good at nothing. They must never shut themselves in small houses, brag about themselves, and act like overlords. Except for enemies, traitors, and those who sabotage the War of Resistance and unity, who have no right to speak, everyone else has the freedom to speak. Even if they say something wrong, it doesn't matter. National affairs are public affairs of the country, not private affairs of a party or faction. Therefore, Communist Party members only have the obligation to practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and have no right to exclude others and monopolize everything. The Communist Party is a political party that seeks the interests of the nation and the people, and it has no selfish interests to seek. It should be supervised by the people and should never violate the will of the people. Its members should stand among the people and should never stand above the people. Comrades, our principle of practicing democratic cooperation with non-Party members is fixed and unchangeable, it is forever unchanged, and it should be well implemented in the Assembly now. I think that our Communist Party members in the Assembly, under our policy, can receive a good education in the Assembly and overcome their closed-doorism and sectarianism. We are not a self-righteous small sect, we must learn to open the door and practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members, we must learn to be good at discussing problems with others in attitude and style. Perhaps even today there are such Communist Party members who say that if we have to cooperate with others, we won't do it. But I believe that there are very few such people. I dare to guarantee to you that the vast majority of our Party members will definitely be able to implement the line of our Party Central Committee. At the same time, I would also like to ask all non-Party comrades to approve of our proposal and understand that the Communist Party is not a small sect or small group that only seeks private interests. No, the Communist Party is sincerely trying to do a good job in national affairs. But we still have many shortcomings. We are not afraid to speak out about our shortcomings, and we must correct our shortcomings. We must strengthen Party education to eliminate these shortcomings, and we must also eliminate these shortcomings through democratic cooperation with non-Party members. This is called attacking from both inside and outside, curing the shortcomings, and truly doing a good job in national affairs." (Rectification Documents, Beijing Xinhua Bookstore, 1949 edition, pages 253-254)

### 斯大林毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作

　　斯大林毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作
    【新华社二十五日讯】斯大林毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作。
    斯大林同志在一九三三年二月十九日第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上的演说中说：“现在让我来说说几点个别的意见。
    首先就要说说我们的农村中的党员。你们中间有许多党员，可是非党员还要更多。参加这次大会的非党员比党员更多，这是种好现象。因为我们首先就要吸收非党员来参加我们的事业。有些共产党员是用布尔什维克态度来对待非党员集体农民的。可是，还有一些共产党员却以自己的党员资格自傲，不许非党员来和他们接近。这是不好的，而且是有害的。布尔什维克所以有力量，共产党员所以有力量，就是因为他们善于把千百万非党员积极分子团结在我们党周围。我们布尔什维克如果没能使千百万非党员工农群众来信任我们党，便不会有现在这样的胜利。可是，要怎样才可做到这一步呢？要做到这一步，就要党员不与非党员隔绝，不要闭户幽居，不要以自己的党员资格自傲，而要倾听非党员的意见，不仅是要教导非党员，而且要向非党员学习。
    不要忘记，党员并不是从天上掉下来的。要记着，所有一切党员自己都是由非党员变成党员的。今天他们是一个非党员，明天他就会成为党员了。究竟有什么可以自傲的地方呢？我们老布尔什维克当中，有许多同志已在党内做了二三十年的工作。而我们自己过去也有一个时候不曾是党员哩。假使在二三十年以前，当时的党员也鄙视我们，不许我们接近党，那我们会有怎样的情形呢？我们也许会在党外多混几年的。可是，同志们，我们老布尔什维克并不是一些最不中用的人哩。
    正因为如此，所以我们的党员，我们的现时还很年轻而有时瞧不起非党员的那些党员，就应当记着这一切情形。应当记着：使布尔什维克增光的，不是骄傲，而是谦逊。”（列宁主义问题莫斯科一九四九年中文版第五五六至五五七页。）
    毛泽东同志在一九四一年十一月二十一日陕甘宁边区参议会的演说中说：
    “一部分共产党员，还不善于同党外人士实行民主合作，还保存一种狭隘的关门主义或宗派主义的错误思想，他们还不明白共产党员有义务与党外人士合作，无权利排斥党外人士的原则。这就是倾听群众意见，要联系群众，而不要脱离群众的原则。陕甘宁边区施政纲领上有一条，规定共产党员应与党外人士实行民主合作，不得一意孤行，把持包办，就是为了防止这一部分还不明白党的政策的同志而说的。共产党员必须倾听党外人士的意见，给别人以说话的机会。别人说得对的，我们应该欢迎，应该跟别人学习。别人说得不对，也应该让别人说完，然后慢慢加以解释。共产党员决不可自以为是，盛气凌人，自己是什么都好，别人是什么都不好。决不可把自己关在小房子里，自吹自擂，称王称霸。除了敌人汉奸以及破坏抗战与团结的人们没有说话的资格以外，其他任何人，都有说话的自由。即使说错了也不要紧的，国事是国家的公事，不是一党一派的私事，因此共产党员只有对党外人士实行民主合作的义务，而无排斥别人垄断一切的权利。共产党是为民族、为人民谋利益的政党，它本身决无私利可图。它应该受人民的监督，而决不应该违背人民的意旨。它的党员应该站在民众之中，而决不应该站在民众之上。同志们，我们这个同党外人士实行民主合作的原则，是固定不移的，是永远不变的，现在应在参议会中好好实行起来。我想，我们共产党的参议员，在我们这样的政策下面，可以在参议会中受到很好的教育，克服自己的关门主义与宗派主义。我们不是一个自以为是的小宗派，我们一定要学会打开大门与党外人士实行民主合作的办法，我们一定要学会善于同别人商量问题的态度和作风。也许到今天还有这样的共产党员，他们说，如果要与别人合作，我们就不干了。但是我相信，这样的人是极少的。我敢向各位保证，我党绝大多数的党员是一定能够执行我党中央的路线的。同时也要请各位党外同志赞成我们的主张，了解共产党并不是一个只图私利的小宗派、小团体，不是的，共产党是真心实意想把国事办好的。但是我们的毛病还很多。我们不怕说出自己的毛病，我们一定要改正自己的毛病。我们要加强党内教育来清除这些毛病，我们还要经过与党外人士实行民主合作，来清除这些毛病。这个叫做内外夹攻，把毛病治好，把国事真正办好起来”。（整风文献北京新华书店一九四九年版第二五三至二五四页）
