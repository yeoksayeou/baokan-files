Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th -- China's People's film industry is developing rapidly with a brand new attitude. Since the establishment of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, three film studios have been established nationwide in Northeast China, Beijing, and Shanghai, along with 58 newsreel photography teams, employing over 3,000 film workers. Major administrative regions across the country have also established six film management companies in Northeast China, North China, East China, Central and South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, as well as 100 film projection teams. Last year alone, a total of eight newsreels, six feature films, and three translated films were produced.

As early as 1938, the People's film industry was founded in Yan'an, but at that time there was only a photography team composed of six or seven cadres. From 1938 to 1940, the first documentary, "Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army," was filmed, followed by five short documentaries such as "Nanniwan." These films were all silent.

In 1946, the Northeast Film Studio was established, and North China also had a film team. Only then did China's People's film industry gradually take shape. From 1946 to 1949, the Northeast Film Studio successively completed more than a dozen newsreels and short films, including various issues of "Democratic Northeast," "The Final Battle to Liberate Northeast," and "The Three-Year War of Liberation in Northeast." These works truthfully recorded the heroic struggle of the Northeast people for liberation and played a significant role in propaganda and education among the broad masses of soldiers and civilians. During the filming, the war zone photography teams composed of photographers followed the vanguard companies and platoons in their attacks. Communist Party members such as photographers Zhang Shaoke, Wang Jingan, and Yang Yinxuan heroically sacrificed their lives in their work.

The complete liberation of Northeast China and the successive liberation of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai provided favorable conditions for the rapid development of China's People's film industry. In 1948, the work of the Northeast Film Studio greatly expanded. In 1949, the Beijing China Electric Third Factory of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Shanghai China Electric First and Second Factories, China Film Studio, and Experimental Film Factory were taken over and reorganized into the Beijing and Shanghai Film Studios. Due to the participation of some film workers from the old liberated areas of Northeast and North China, the Beijing Film Studio quickly resumed production, taking over the task of producing newsreels from the Northeast Film Studio.

Before 1948, the output of Chinese People's films was all newsreels. At the end of 1948, the Northeast Film Studio began filming its first feature film, "The Bridge," which was also the first film depicting the Chinese working class as the masters of the new society. After the release of "The Bridge," it was immediately warmly welcomed by the broad audience, especially the workers. Workers in Nanjing and other places launched a wave of learning from Old Liang (one of the main characters in "The Bridge"), and 37 trade unions presented banners to the filmmakers and the film studio. Subsequently, the Northeast Film Studio completed the feature films "Back to Our Own Ranks," "Boundless Light," "Daughter of China," "White-Clad Warrior," and "Invisible Front" in 1949, and is about to complete films such as "Zhao Yiman" and "Mongolian Spring." These feature films vividly reflected the heroic battles and fearless spirit of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers dedicating themselves to the cause of liberation. In 1949, the Northeast Film Studio also translated three Soviet feature films: "An Ordinary Soldier," "The Russian Question," and "The Great Turn," with extremely successful translation techniques.

The newsreels completed in 1949 included: "Huaihai Campaign, Liberation of Taiyuan," "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "The Fourth Field Army's Southern Expedition," "The Birth of New China," "Great Friendship" by the Beijing Film Studio and "The Entry Ceremony into Beiping," "Rich Northeast," and "The Three-Year War of Liberation in Northeast" by the Northeast Film Studio, totaling eight films, exceeding the original production plan by two films. These films recorded the great historical scenes of the Chinese People's War of Liberation and aroused great influence among the broad masses of the people. Since November of last year, the Beijing Film Studio has hired Soviet film masters Gerasimov and Varlamov and other Soviet film workers to participate in the work, starting to shoot two color documentaries reflecting the victory of the war and the construction of new China.

In a short period of time, China's People's film industry has achieved the aforementioned leapfrog development, becoming a powerful weapon for propaganda and education in the new China. The liberation of the whole country and the beginning of the great peaceful construction have provided favorable conditions and greater tasks for the development of the People's film industry. Under the leadership of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, Chinese People's film workers are full of confidence in accepting this glorious and huge task. In 1950, the Film Bureau plans to produce seven times more films than in 1949, totaling 84 films, including 26 feature films, 17 documentaries, 1 animated film, and 40 translated films; translate 84 Soviet educational, cultural, and scientific short films and produce "New China Briefs"; in terms of distribution, under the system of six management companies, offices and distribution stations will be widely established in order to face the workers, peasants and soldiers and expand film projection work among them, by the end of 1950 the number of projection teams will be increased from 100 last year to 700; at the same time, foreign distribution will be strengthened, and foreign distribution has begun to expand to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and other countries.

In the future, Chinese People's film workers will continue to improve their work, better learn from the Soviet film industry, and continuously improve the ideological and artistic quality of their works in the process of development, so that the Chinese People's film industry can enter a higher stage.

　　人民电影事业猛进
    本年内将制新片一百六十余部   
    为工农兵扩增放映队至七百个
    【新华社北京二十七日电】中国人民电影事业，正以崭新的姿态飞跃地发展着。自中央人民政府文化部电影局成立后，全国已建立了东北、北京、上海三个制片厂，五十八个新闻纪录片摄影队，拥有三千多名电影工作者；全国各大行政区也分别成立了东北、华北、华东、中南、西南、西北六个影片经理公司和一百个电影放映队。去年一年内，共摄制成了八部新闻纪录片、六部故事片和三部翻译片。
    远在一九三八年，中国人民电影事业即在延安创立，但当时只有一个由六、七个干部组成的摄影队。一九三八年到一九四○年中，拍摄了第一部纪录片《延安与八路军》，以后陆续摄制了《南泥湾》等五部简短的纪录片，这些片子都是无声的。
    一九四六年东北电影制片厂成立，华北也有了一个电影队，中国的人民电影事业才渐渐初具规模。一九四六年到一九四九年，东北电影制片厂先后完成了十几部新闻纪录片和短片，包括各辑《民主东北》、《解放东北的最后战役》、《东北三年解放战争》等。这些作品都真实地纪录了东北人民英勇争取解放的史实，并在广大军民中起了极大的宣传教育作用。在摄制中，摄影工作者们组成的战地摄影队，跟随着担任攻击的尖刀连、尖刀排前进，曾有摄影师张绍柯、王静安、杨阴萱等共产党员在工作中壮烈牺牲。
    东北全境解放和北京、天津、上海的相继解放，给中国人民电影事业提供了迅速发展的有利条件。一九四八年东北电影制片厂的工作大大开展。一九四九年国民党反动政府的北京中电三厂和上海接管的中电一、二厂、中国电影制片厂、实验电影工厂等先后被接管和改组成北京与上海两个电影制片厂。由于东北、华北老解放区一部分电影工作干部的参加，北京电影制片厂迅速地恢复了生产，接替了东北电影制片厂制作新闻纪录片的任务。
    一九四八年以前，中国人民电影的出品，都是新闻纪录片。一九四八年底，东北电影制片厂开始第一部故事片《桥》的摄制，这也是第一部描写作为新社会的主人翁的中国工人阶级的影片。《桥》放映后，立即受到广大的观众特别是工人的热烈欢迎，南京等地的工人发起向老梁（《桥》里主要的人物之一）学习的热潮，有三十七个工会向电影工作者和制片厂献旗。接着东北电影制片厂在四九年又完成了《回到自己队伍来》、《光芒万丈》、《中华女儿》、《白衣战士》、《无形的战线》等故事片，并即将完成的有《赵一曼》、《蒙古春光》等片。这些故事片都生动地反映了中国工、农、兵为解放事业而献身的英勇战斗与无畏精神。一九四九年东北电影制片厂还翻译了三部苏联的故事片：《一个普通的战士》、《俄罗斯问题》和《大转变》，翻译技术极为成功。
    一九四九年完成的新闻纪录片有：北京电影制片厂的《淮海战役、太原解放》、《百万雄师下江南》、《第四野战军南征记》、《新中国的诞生》、《伟大的友谊》和东北电影制片厂的《北平入城式》、《富饶东北》、《东北三年解放战争》共八部，超过原定生产计划两部。这些影片记录了中国人民解放战争中的伟大的历史场面，在广大的人民中引起了巨大的影响。去年十一月起，北京电影制片厂又聘请了苏联电影名导演格拉西莫夫与瓦尔拉莫夫为首的苏联电影工作者参加工作，开始拍摄两部反映战争胜利与新中国建设的五彩纪录片。
    在短短的时期中，中国人民电影事业已获得了上述飞跃的发展，成为新中国宣传教育的有力的武器。全国的解放和伟大和平建设的开始，为人民电影事业的发展提供了有利的条件和更大的任务。中国的人民电影工作者在中央人民政府文化部电影局的领导下正满怀着信心接受这光荣巨大的任务。一九五○年，电影局计划生产七倍于四九年的影片，计制作故事片二十六部、纪录片十七部、美术片一部、翻译片四十部，共八十四部；翻译苏联文教科学短片和摄制《新中国简报》共八十四号；发行方面，在六个经理公司的系统下，将普遍建立办事处与发行站，为了面向工、农、兵，建立与扩大工、农、兵中间的电影放映工作，在一九五○年底将使放映队由去年的一百个队增加到七百个队；同时将加强国外发行，现国外发行已开始扩展到苏联、东欧、东南亚及其他国家中去。
    今后，中国的人民电影工作者将继续地改进自己的工作，更好地向苏联电影事业学习，在发展过程中不断地提高作品的思想性与艺术性，而使中国人民电影事业进入一个更高的阶段。
