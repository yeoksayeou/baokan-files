Lu Cuiying
    ——A Female Party Branch Secretary Leading Production
    Xin Tuo
    Lu Cuiying is twenty years old this year. She is a female labor hero from Zhoukou Village, Fifth District, Fangshan County, and leads a work group that implements year-round production. She is also the Party branch secretary of the village, and cooperates very well with all the Party and non-Party cadres in the village.
    Lu Cuiying's family was very poor. They rented eight mu of land from the Chen family's landlord. After a year of hard work, after paying five stone six dou of rent and enduring the extortion of the Japanese puppet regime and the Chiang Kai-shek era, only a few handfuls of coarse chaff were left. Therefore, Lu Cuiying followed her father to Zhoukoudian to work in the kiln and collect coal cinders when she was twelve years old. She had never worn a new piece of clothing.
    Zhoukou Village was liberated before the liberation of the Beijing-Tianjin Campaign in November 1948. Lu Cuiying was only eighteen years old. Under the help and education of the work team, she understood the situation and demanded to stand up and liberate herself, opposing feudal forces. She also participated in training classes held by the county and district, and gradually understood that to eliminate feudal forces, she must wage a resolute struggle. She led the villagers to carry out land reform against the feudal landlords. She was allocated six mu of land and two rooms. At the same time, due to her active work, she was elected as a village representative and director of the village women's federation. Within the Party, she was appointed as the branch secretary.
    After the land reform ended, Cuiying attended the district's March production meeting. After returning to the village, she went from door to door to promote: "Labor is the most glorious. After land reform, we must become rich through production and build our families through labor!" "If women want to be liberated, they can't just rely on men for food! Gender equality means everyone must participate in production!"

  Do a good job of the "United Hearts Group" - take the lead to influence the whole village.

    Zhoukou Village was originally a poor village; in ordinary years, there was a grain shortage for four months. The masses mostly relied on selling labor, working in kilns, and burning lime for a living. In addition, due to the extortion of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries over the years, many households had nothing to eat at the beginning of spring. At that time, it coincided with the spring planting season, and there were many difficulties in the work. At this time, Lu Cuiying thought of the "cooperation and mutual assistance" mentioned in the district and contacted five young women, including Lu Yuqin and Li Shuqin, to form a work group. This group spoke kindly and was united, so they called themselves the "United Hearts Group". At the same time, they called on all the women in the village to participate in production and free up the men to sell their labor to earn food. After the "United Hearts Group" was established, they first planted sixty trees. Five people plowed one and three-tenths mu of land in half a day. The group also transported water to plant thirteen mu of cotton, peanuts, and five hundred melon plants, using a total of sixty-five work days, saving fifty-five male work days, and earning more than four stone of corn by carrying coal on kilns. Under the leading influence of the "United Hearts Group", through the mobilization and organization of all village cadres, 193 of the 263 women in the village with labor power participated in sending manure, planting land, digging pits, releasing water, and planting seeds. Among them, 118 people organized twenty-four temporary work groups. The whole village planted 263 mu of cotton and peanuts (the district arranged for 180 mu), using a total of 1,600 work days, of which women accounted for 600 work days.
    After Lu Cuiying participated in the May Prefectural Production Conference, the newspaper praised her, and production became even more enthusiastic. At that time, it was the seedling weeding season, and even more households in the village had nothing to eat. She continued to organize women to weed the seedlings. In order to promote military dependents' production, the "United Hearts Group" took the initiative to absorb Feng Yucheng's family, a military dependent. Their seven families had a total of 66 mu of land, all of which were weeded three times, of which twelve mu were weeded four to five times, and three mu of cotton were weeded six times. The seven families saved a total of 180 male work days, earning nine stone and four dou of corn by carrying coal on kilns. The original plan was to provide Feng Yucheng's family with 35 work days of substitute labor, but besides using one and a half work days during sowing, the "United Hearts Group" weeded all the seedlings. Under the leading influence of the "United Hearts Group" and the mobilization and organization of village cadres, another 62 women participated in weeding the seedlings. The whole village had a total of 2,683 mu of land, of which 900 mu were weeded once by women, 150 mu were weeded twice, and 81 mu were weeded three times, saving male labor to earn 50 stone of corn on kilns. Women also universally gathered wild vegetables, and that's how they survived the summer famine. During the seedling weeding season, it was rainy and cloudy, and weeding the land was equivalent to moving grass for grass. She mobilized women to pull grass, and the pulled grass was dug into pits and used as fertilizer. A total of more than 600,000 catties of green manure were pressed.
    When the cotton grew to more than a foot high, aphids appeared. People in the village said it was a "natural disaster" and "divine insects," and the more they treated it, the more there were. She went to the district to attend a meeting and heard that tobacco leaf water could cure it, but she didn't have the money to buy it. She discussed it with the village cadres and adopted the suggestion of the sixty-year-old industrial committee member and went with twelve male and female cadres to the west mountain of the village to dig "Acanthopanax" roots and "Artemisia apiacea" (both medicinal materials). They dug a total of more than 210 catties, and stayed up half the night grinding the medicine and adding lime to boil two large pots. The next day, they and the village cadres took the medicine water and first treated their own land. After washing with the medicine water the first day, the next day a layer of black aphids turned into a layer of white frost, and the aphids were killed. Once this spread, people in the village rushed to take the medicine water to wash, and the cotton aphids were wiped out.
    During the district's production inspection meeting, after democratic evaluation, the red flag was awarded to Zhoukou Village. Lu Cuiying returned to the village holding the big red flag, and Zhoukou Village became a production model village.
    At the beginning of the autumn harvest work, she put forward the slogan of "protecting the flag" to the whole village. Lu Cuiying personally carried a rifle and led three militia squads to patrol day and night in rotation to protect the autumn harvest. The masses said: "In previous years, we spent a lot of grain to hire guards, and we still lost a lot of grain; this year we didn't take a single grain, and we didn't lose a single grain, truly the Communist Party's method is superior!" The "United Hearts Group's" plan for the three autumn harvests was: (1) Guarantee that all the group's land, except for耕地, will not use male labor for tidying up. (2) Leave cotton land. (3) All soaking seeds, field selection of seeds. (4) In addition to their own harvesting, sell labor early and late to help people dig out grain, ensuring that each person earns a cotton coat or a small pig. After the plan was formulated, the group harvested three mu of grain the first day, and also dug it out to dry when they returned. In ten days, they harvested the land of seven families. Taking the "United Hearts Group's" model role to drive the women in the whole village, fifty-seven stone of grain and forty-five stone of corn were selected in the fields. Lu Cuiying earned 19,200 yuan (enough to buy three dou of rice at the time) by digging grain for others, and also learned to plow the land with the help of the industrial committee member, plowing a total of ten mu. When planting wheat, she similarly took the lead in experimenting and taught the masses the method of soaking seeds. A few households who did not listen to her words regretted it when they saw that the wheat seedlings that had been soaked were dark and strong.
    The autumn harvest work of the whole village was completed ahead of schedule under the leading influence of Lu Cuiying.
    In Zhoukou Village, where there was no habit of winter production, Lu Cuiying came up with various kinds of sideline production for the masses and took the lead in organizing various production groups such as collecting coal cinders, making and selling shoes, spinning thread, opening tofu workshops, and working in coal kilns (Changouyu, Zhoukoudian, Mentougou). The "United Hearts Group" went to Beijing to buy calcium carbide and sell it to coal mine workers. The money earned by the four people bought two piglets to raise together, and each person also received two dou and four liters of corn.
    Lu Cuiying is not only an excellent production leader in the village, but her name has also spread throughout Fangshan County. Under the slogans of "Learning from Lu Cuiying" and "Challenging Lu Cuiying!" in Fangshan's villages, the production competition movement was carried out enthusiastically.
    The "United Hearts Group" not only worked hard in production, but also used their rest time in the fields to learn culture, literacy, and question each other. They didn't talk with their mouths when they had something to do, but often wrote letters to each other to improve each other. What they learned was both practical and remembered firmly. Seven people went from being illiterate to, after years of study, four people being able to write ordinary letters and three people recognizing more than 300 characters.

    Dare to Correct Mistakes - Good at Uniting the Masses

    What is Lu Cuiying's experience in leading production?
    First of all, she leads production with her own example, using production to lead production. In every production work, she used her own and the "United Hearts Group's" model actions to mobilize the masses through universal appeals and the organization and mobilization of cadres responsible for specific areas, setting off a production upsurge. But the most important thing is to bravely correct mistakes and solve the unity problems within the village and group in a timely manner. At the beginning, she focused on mobilizing young women, and at the same time, in the education of young women, she also one-sidedly emphasized women's liberation, resulting in the opposition between young and old women. Older women felt that "after liberation, daughters-in-law are now in charge of their mothers-in-law." After the county and district discovered this phenomenon, they pointed it out to Lu Cuiying. Cuiying immediately took the initiative to hold a meeting with the older women, made a self-criticism at the meeting, admitted her mistake, and said: "I, Lu Cuiying, am a newly liberated woman, and I am not yet familiar with the policies of our People's Government and the Communist Party. I only talked about liberating young women and did not take care of the elderly. I will definitely pay attention to correcting this in the future and resolutely correct it!" At the same time, she suggested expanding the ten women representatives (all young women) to fifteen, paying special attention to absorbing two middle-aged women and two elderly women to participate. After the problem of elderly women was solved, young women became unhappy again, thinking that they were not liberating after only a few days of "liberation." Cuiying held another meeting with the young women, explaining the true meaning of women's liberation, saying: "Women's liberation should be about working hard in production and having harmonious families." After this meeting, the families of Fu He and Zhang Wenzhi, who used to fight and quarrel with their mothers-in-law frequently, never quarreled again. In addition, after the county and district praised Cuiying, some people in the "United Hearts Group" were not very satisfied, saying: "The credit belongs to everyone, but she is the only one being praised!" Cuiying took out the medal awarded to her by the county and rotated it among the whole group, and whenever Cuiying talked about work achievements, she always said: "Our village..." because she believed that "glory belongs to everyone!"

　　卢翠英
    ——一个领导生产的女支部书记
    辛拓
    卢翠英，今年二十岁，是房山县五区周口村的女劳动英雄，领导着一个贯彻全年生产的拨工组。她又是该村的支部书记，和全村的党与非党的干部们合作得很好。
    卢翠英的家庭很贫苦，租种了陈家地主的八亩地，一年辛苦，除去交了五石六斗租子，日伪蒋统治时代的勒索外，只剩下几把粗糠了。因此，卢翠英十二岁就跟着她父亲到周口店去走窑，捡煤核。身上从来没有穿过一件新衣服。
    周口村在一九四八年十一月解放京津战役前解放，卢翠英还只有十八岁。她在工作组的帮助教育下，心眼亮了，要求站起来解放自己，反对封建势力。她又参加了县、区召开的训练班，一天天地明白了要消灭封建势力，必须坚决斗争。她领导着全村农民，向封建地主进行了土地改革。她分得了六亩地、两间房。同时，由于她工作积极，被选为村代表和村妇联主任。在党内，她被任为支部书记。
    土地改革结束了，翠英参加了区里召开的三月生产会议。回村后，就挨门挨户的宣传说：“劳动是最光荣的，土地改革后，就要生产致富，劳动发家呀！”“妇女要想解放，不能光靠男人吃饭呀！男女平等就都要参加生产！”
  搞好“合心组”  带头影响全村。
    周口村本来是个穷村；平常年景就差四个月吃粮。群众多依靠卖工、走窑、烧灰为生。再加上历年来日伪、国民党反动派的勒索，一开春就有好多户没的吃，当时又正赶上春季植树、播种，工作上困难颇多。这时卢翠英想起了区里说的“合作互助”，便串通了卢玉琴、李淑琴等五个青年妇女，组织了一个拨工组。她们这组说话和气团结，所以她们自称为：“合心组”。同时号召全村妇女都参加生产，腾出男人卖工挣粮吃。“合心组”成立后先动手栽了六十棵树，五个人一晌午就刨了一亩三分地，全组又挑水点种了十三亩棉花、花生、五百棵瓜，共使了六十五个工，省下了五十五个男工，上窑背煤挣回四石多玉米。在“合心组”的带头影响下，通过全体村干部分片组织动员，全村有劳动力的妇女二百六十三人中当时就有一百九十三个人参加送粪、种地、刨坑、放水、点籽。其中有一百一十八个人组织起二十四个临时拨工组。全村种棉花花生二百六十三亩（区里布置的是一百八十亩），一共用了一千六百个工，其中妇女就占了六百个工。
    卢翠英参加了五月专署生产会议之后，报纸上表扬了她，生产就更起劲了。当时正赶上锄苗，村里没吃的户更多了。她又继续组织妇女锄苗。为了带动军属生产，“合心组”主动吸收了军属冯玉臣家，她们七家共有六十六亩地，全部锄了三遍，其中有十二亩锄到四到五遍，三亩棉花锄了六遍。七家共省下一百八十个男工，上窑背煤挣玉米九石四斗。原来确定给冯玉臣家代耕工三十五个，但她除了播种时用了一个半工外，锄苗全是“合心组”拨工锄的。在“合心组”的带头影响和村干部分片动员组织下又有六十二个妇女参加锄苗，全村共有两千六百八十三亩地，其中妇女锄头遍的有九百亩，锄二遍的有一百五十亩，三遍的有八十一亩，省下男工上窑挣回了玉米五十石。妇女还普遍地打野菜，就这样渡过了夏荒。锄苗时正是阴雨连天，锄地就等于给草搬家，她就发动了妇女拔草，拔下的草刨坑压肥，一共压了有六十多万斤绿肥。
    棉花长到一尺多高的时候，起了蚜虫。村里人们说是“天灾”、“神虫”，越治越多。她到区里开会听说烟叶水能治，可又没钱买。她跟村干部们开会商量了一下，采纳了六十多岁的实业委员的意见，和十二个男女干部到村西山上去刨“五加皮”根，和“切蒿”（均药材名），一共刨了二百一十多斤，回来半夜没睡觉，把药砸碎了加上石灰熬了两大锅，第二天就和村干部拿药水先治自己的地。头天拿药水洗了之后，第二天一层黑忽忽的蚜虫就变成一层白霜，蚜虫治死了。这一传开，村里人都抢着拿药水洗，棉蚜虫扑灭了。
    区里开生产检阅大会时，民主评判，红旗归周口村。卢翠英抱着大红旗回村来，周口村成了生产模范村了。
    在三秋工作开始时，她向全村提出了“保旗”的号召。卢翠英亲自背着大枪带领着三个民兵班白天黑夜轮回巡逻护秋。群众都说：“往年花好多粮食雇看青的，粮食也不少丢；今年一粒没拿，一颗粮食也没丢，真是共产党的办法高！”“合心组”在三秋工作中的计划是（一）全组土地除耕地外，保证不用男工收拾。（二）留下棉地。（三）全部浸种，田间选种。（四）除自己收割外，早晚卖工帮人掏谷，每人保证挣一件棉衣或一个小猪。计划订出后，全组头天就割了三亩谷，回来还掏了晒起来，十天的功夫收割了七家的地。以“合心组”的模范作用带动全村妇女田间选种五十七石谷，四十五石玉米。卢翠英给人家掏谷挣了一万九千二百元（当时能买三斗米），还向实业委员学会扶了犁耕地，一共耕了十亩。种麦时她同样以身作则先试验，并且教给群众浸种办法。少数没听她话的户一瞧浸了种的麦苗又黑又结实，都后悔了。
    全村三秋工作，就在卢翠英的带头影响下，提前完成了。
    在没有冬季生产习惯的周口村，卢翠英给群众想出了各种各样的副业生产，以身作则的组织了拾煤核、做卖鞋、纺线、开豆腐坊、上煤窑（长沟峪、周口店、门头沟）等各种生产小组。“合心组”上北京买电石回来卖给煤窑工人，四个人赚的钱买了两头小猪伙养，一人还分了二斗四升玉米。
    卢翠英不仅是一个村的优秀的生产领导者，她的名字还响遍了全房山县。房山各村在“学习卢翠英”“向卢翠英挑战！”的口号下，生产竞赛运动轰轰烈烈的搞了起来。
    “合心组”不但生产搞得起劲，在地头上，他们还利用休息时间学文化，识字、互相考问。他们有事不用嘴谈，常常拿笔写信，互相提高，学出来又实用，记的又结实，七个人从一字不识，经过年来的学习，现在已经有四个人能写平常信，三个人都识了三百多字。
    勇于改正错误  善于团结群众
    卢翠英领导生产有什么经验呢？
    首先她以身作则，以生产领导生产。无论在那一件生产工作中，她都是以自己和“合心组”的模范行动，通过普遍号召与干部分片负责组织动员了群众，掀起了生产热潮。而最重要的还是勇敢地改正错误，适时解决村内、组内的团结问题。开始，她着重发动了青年妇女，同时在对青年妇女的教育上，也片面的强调了妇女解放，结果造成了青、老年妇女的对立。老年妇女感到“解放了，媳妇倒管起婆婆来了。”县区发现这种现象后，给卢翠英指了出来。翠英立即主动的找老年妇女们开会，会上作了自我检讨，承认错误，说：“我卢翠英是新解放的妇女，对咱人民政府共产党的政策也还不太熟悉。光说叫青年妇女解放，没有照顾到老年人，今后我一定注意改正，坚决纠正它！”同时建议把十名妇女代表（都是青年妇女）扩大到十五名，特别注意吸收了两名壮年妇女，两名老年妇女参加。老年妇女问题解决了，青年妇女又不高兴了，认为是刚“解放”几天又不解放了。翠英又给青年妇女开会，讲解了妇女解放的真正意义，说：“妇女解放应该是努力生产，家庭和睦。”开了这个会后，以前婆媳间经常打架吵嘴的傅何氏家和张文志家一次嘴也不吵了。另外县区表扬了翠英之后，“合心组”有的人就不大满意说：“功劳是大家的，受表扬的是她个人！”翠英就把县里奖给她的奖章拿出来全组轮流带，每当翠英说到工作成绩时，总是说：“我们村……”因为她认定“光荣是大家的！”
