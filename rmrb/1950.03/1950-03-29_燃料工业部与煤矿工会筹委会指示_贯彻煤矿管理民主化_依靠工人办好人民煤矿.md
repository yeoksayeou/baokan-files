Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China recently issued joint instructions on implementing democratic management of coal mines. The full text is as follows:

　　According to the "Instructions on Establishing Factory Management Committees in State-owned and Publicly-operated Factories" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on February 28, 1950, conscientiously implementing democratic management in state-owned and publicly-operated coal mining enterprises based on the "Implementation Regulations on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Employee Representative Conferences in State-owned and Publicly-operated Factories and Enterprises" promulgated by the North China People's Government in 1949 is the central link in transforming the remnants of bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism in current coal mine management and running people's coal mines well. As the Financial and Economic Committee's instructions stated: Some administrative leaders of state-owned and publicly-operated enterprises do not have a clear understanding of the concept of relying on the working masses to manage enterprises well, and the erroneous idea of relying solely on administrative orders to complete production tasks still exists. The reason why the production efficiency of many coal mines cannot be improved and serious accidents continue to occur is that: some coal mines are still implementing a set of old, completely unchanged bureaucratic and feudal management systems; some coal mine management committees have been established, but they are nominal, and various important issues are not discussed and resolved by the management committee, but are decided solely by the bureau affairs meeting or the factory director individually; some members of the management committee are mostly not truly democratically elected, but are appointed administratively; in this way, it is naturally impossible for workers to feel that they are the masters of the enterprise, change their old labor attitude, and give full play to their production enthusiasm and creativity. For this reason, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China, in addition to issuing a resolution and order on implementing the abolition of the headman system, hereby issue the following joint instructions on implementing democratic management of coal mines:

　　A. The Coal Mine Management Bureaus and coal miners' union organizations in the three regions of Northeast, North China, and East China should quickly discuss together and instruct all subordinate mining areas to conscientiously establish management committees and employee representative conferences; and in the three regions of Northeast, North China, and East China, each region should elect a mining area as a demonstration area for implementing these instructions; the Coal Mine Management Bureaus and coal miners' union organizations of each region should select capable cadres to personally implement key breakthroughs, create experience, and promote the entire region.

　　B. After receiving these instructions, the Coal Mine Management Bureaus and union organizations of each region should discuss and arrange the work within one week according to the methods instructed in item (A), and report the results of the discussion and arrangement to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China respectively.

　　C. The issues discussed when establishing management committees and convening employee representative conferences in each mining area should focus on improving coal mine safety equipment and reducing accidents.

　　D. It is now stipulated that April and May are the key breakthrough demonstration period for implementing these instructions. During this period, the Coal Mine Management Bureaus and union organizations of Northeast, North China, and East China must submit a special report on the establishment of management committees and employee representative conferences directly to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the National Coal Miners' Union on schedule (on the 1st and 16th of each month). In this special report, it is necessary to focus on explaining the situation and experience of the key demonstration area.

　　E. Each mining area must summarize the implementation of these instructions before June 1st and submit them to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China respectively.

　　燃料工业部与煤矿工会筹委会指示
    贯彻煤矿管理民主化
    依靠工人办好人民煤矿
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部和中国煤矿工会筹备委员会顷发出关于贯彻煤矿管理民主化的联合指示。全文如下：
    根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会一九五○年二月二十八日所发《关于国营、公营工厂建立工厂管理委员会的指示》，在国营、公营煤矿企业中根据一九四九年华北人民政府所颁布《关于在国营、公营工厂企业中，建立工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的实施条例》，认真实行管理民主化，是改造目前煤矿管理上官僚资本主义与封建主义的残余，办好人民煤矿的中心环节。正如财经委员会的指示中所说：有些国营、公营企业的行政负责人对依靠工人群众管好企业的观点不够明确，单凭依靠行政命令来完成生产任务的错误思想，依然存在。目前许多煤矿生产效率不能提高，严重事故不断发生，其原因是由于：有的煤矿仍在执行着一套旧的原封不动的官僚主义与封建主义的管理制度；有的煤矿管理委员会虽已建立，但是有名无实，各种重要问题，却不经管委会讨论解决，而是单纯由局务会议或厂长个人决定；有的管委会的委员，多半不是真正经过民主选举，而是由行政上指派的；这样自然就无法使工人感到自己是企业的主人，而改变其旧的劳动态度，发挥其生产积极性与创造性。为此中央人民政府燃料工业部与中国煤矿工会筹备委员会，除发布贯彻关于废除把头制度的决议与命令外，特再发出关于贯彻煤矿管理民主化的联合指示如下：
    甲、东北、华北、及华东三个地区的煤矿管理总局与各该区煤矿工会组织，应迅速共同商讨并通令所属各矿区认真建立管委会与职工代表会议；并应在东北、华北、华东三个地区，每区选举一个矿区作为执行这一指示的示范区；由各区煤矿管理总局与该区的煤矿工会组织，选派得力干部亲自动手，实行重点突破创造经验，推动全区。
    乙、各区煤矿管理总局与工会组织，接到本指示后，应根据（甲）项所指示的办法于一星期内讨论，并布置完毕，并将讨论与布置结果分别报告中央人民政府燃料工业部与中国煤矿工会筹备委员会。
    丙、各矿区建立管委会与召开职工代表会议时，所讨论的问题，应以改善煤矿安全设备，减少发生事故为中心内容。
    丁、兹规定四、五两个月为执行这一指示的重点突破示范期，在此期内东北、华北、华东的煤矿管理总局与工会组织，必须按期（每月一号十六号）分别直接向中央人民政府燃料工业部与全国煤矿工会筹备委员会作一次有关建立管委会与职工代表会议的专题报告，在这种专题报告中，要着重说明重点示范区的情况经验。
    戊、各矿区于六月一日以前须将执行这一指示的情形作一总结，分别送交中央人民政府燃料工业部与中国煤矿工会筹备委员会。
