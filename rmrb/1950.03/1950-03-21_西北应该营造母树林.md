　　Mother Tree Forests Should Be Created in the Northwest
    Wang Lin Xu Chengwen

    Last year, I went to the Chabei and Suidong counties of the Chahar-Suiyuan area with the North China Ministry of Agriculture's Chahar-Suiyuan Livestock Survey Group to investigate whether windbreaks could be built in the Chahar-Suiyuan grassland area. This spring, I went to the Northwest again to participate in the Northwest Region's symposium on building sand-fixing forests in northern Shaanxi. In these two tasks, we clearly saw that there was a common problem, that is, the supply of seedlings. The solution is not only to build nurseries and cultivate a large number of seedlings, but also to vigorously create mother tree forests, which is also very necessary. Because in these areas, there are already more sand willows, river willows, basket willows, yellow willows, silky willows, small-leaf poplars, white elms, and large-fruit elms, and near Duolun in Chabei there is the Shandian River, the upper reaches of the Luan River, and east of Shangdu there is the non-freezing river, and along the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi there are the Wuding River, the Hongliu River, and the Yanshui River. The original trees and these rivers provide us with the necessary conditions for creating mother tree forests. The method is to choose convenient and suitable river beaches along both sides of the river channel, and every few miles, take willow branches nearby, and use bow-shaped layering, cutting or cross-cutting to create small mother tree forests of 20 to 50 mu. Cuttings are best taken from one- or two-year-old young branches. Each hole should use three or four small branches, and the row spacing should be small, about three or four feet, about 500-600 plants per mu. Time: Spring, rainy season and autumn are all possible, but autumn is the best. The forest created in this way can be used as a mother tree after two or three years, providing cuttings for continuous expansion to the riverine areas. In this way, not only is there no need to do introduction experiments, eliminating the trouble of nursery management, but also it will not fail. There are many successful examples of this. For example, on both sides of the Wei River in Suiyuan, and along the Yang River in Chahar, there are patches of willow trees, forming lush forests. However, when building mother tree forests near the river bank, special attention should be paid to the selection of areas, so that they will not be washed away during floods.

    In the northern Shaanxi area near the Great Wall, there are many sandy depressions with relatively sufficient moisture. Choosing areas with better conditions, the same can be used to create poplar and willow mother tree forests, gradually expanding, and eventually extending around the sand ridges (sand dunes).

　　西北应该营造母树林
    王林　许成文
    去年随华北农业部察绥林牧调查团去察北绥东各县，调查能否在察绥草原地带营造防风林；今春又去西北，参与西北区有关营造陕北防沙林座谈会。在这两件工作中，我们明显看到存在着一个相同的问题，就是苗木的供给问题。解决的途径，除营建苗圃，培育大量苗木外，大力营造母树林，也是非常必要的。因为在这些地区里，已经生长有较多的沙柳、河柳、杞柳、黄柳、绢柳、小叶杨、白榆及大果榆等，且在察北靠多伦附近有滦河上源闪电河，在商都之东有不冻河，陕北沿长城有无定河，红柳河以及延水等。原有的树木与这些河流，供给我们营造母树林的必要条件。其方法即沿河渠两岸，择方便适宜河滩，每隔数里，就近取杨柳枝条，用弓形压条法，扦插法或交叉法，营造二○至五○亩小片母树林。插穗以一、二年生幼嫩者为佳。每穴用三、四根小枝，株行距宜小约三、四尺，每亩约五——六百株。时节：春季，雨季与秋季均可，而以秋季为最好。这样营造的林子，二、三年后就可充作母树之用，供给插条，用以向沿河地区，不断扩展。如此不仅不需作引种试验，免去苗圃经营的麻烦，而且不会失败。这样的成功实例很多。如绥远的蔚河两旁，察哈尔洋河沿岸，已杨柳片片，蔚郁成林。但靠河岸营造母树林，应特别注意选择地区，使在大水时期，不致被冲毁。
    在陕北靠长城一带，有很多沙窝，水分比较充足，择条件较好地区，同样可以营造杨柳母树林，逐渐扩大，最终延及沙梁（沙包）周围。
