　　[Beijing News] Female cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and women's organizations such as the Chinese Women's Federation held separate gatherings yesterday (the 5th) to commemorate International Women's Day "March 8th." The Beijing Municipal People's Government's commemorative meeting for more than 800 female employees was held yesterday afternoon at Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu, Secretary-General Xue Zizheng, and Bureau Chief Dong Ruqin all attended to provide guidance. After Director Dong explained the significance of commemorating this year's "March 8th" festival, she spoke about the learning issues of female cadres. She said: Female cadres from intellectual backgrounds should strive to learn the labor viewpoint, female cadres from old revolutionary base areas with low education levels should study culture, and those from old revolutionary base areas who already have a certain level of cultural theory and work experience should develop the ability to handle work independently. In his speech, Deputy Mayor Zhang encouraged female cadres to cultivate a spirit of hard work, establish a genuine perspective of serving the people, and strengthen unity between new and old cadres, and between male and female cadres. He also called on everyone to strengthen their study of theory, policy, culture, or professional skills according to their individual circumstances.

Li Peizhi and Li Dequan both attended and spoke. In her speech, Li Peizhi said: Women in New China have already achieved basic liberation and have obtained equal rights with men in politics, economics, and law. However, to master these rights and use these rights, we still need to make our own efforts and improvements. She emphasized that women should first establish a revolutionary outlook on life, a perspective of serving the people, participate in labor, participate in production, and become independent workers, producers, and creators of social wealth, in order to achieve complete liberation. In her speech, Li Dequan called on housewives to step up their study of current affairs. She also asked everyone to raise their hands to guarantee that they would read the newspaper carefully when they got home. During the free discussion, Zhu, an old lady of seventy-three, laboring woman Tong, and female students spoke. Finally, Wei Xikui, Zhu Qiang, Liang Xiaoluan, Li Wanyun, Huang Yuhua, and students from the Third Affiliated Elementary School of the Normal University performed programs to add to the fun.
