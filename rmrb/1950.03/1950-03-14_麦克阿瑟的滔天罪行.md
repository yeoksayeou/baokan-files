　　MacArthur's Towering Crimes

　　The Potsdam Declaration, announced on July 26, 1945, was the supreme principle to be followed by the Allied nations in the war against Japan. Regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals, this declaration clearly stipulated: "We do not intend to enslave the Japanese people or eliminate their nation, but war criminals, including those who have mistreated prisoners, will be subject to severe legal sanctions." However, MacArthur, the executor of American imperialist policy in Japan, completely disregarded this provision and consistently adopted a policy of fostering the revival of Japanese militarism, condoning and shielding the Japanese war criminal clique. Since June 1946, he has blatantly begun to release large numbers of arrested or already convicted war criminals without authorization. On March 7th, MacArthur openly announced the so-called "sworn release system," under which all Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced by Allied military tribunals would be released. This towering crime of MacArthur is intolerable to the Chinese people and to all people who love justice and peace around the world.

　　As is well known, as early as June 1946, MacArthur released a group of major zaibatsu war criminals who actively supported Japan's war of aggression, including Ikeda Seihin of the Mitsui Group (who served as the Minister of Finance in the first Konoe Cabinet, which instigated the "July 7th" war of aggression against China), Fujiwara Ginjiro (who served as an advisor to the Tojo Cabinet and Minister of Munitions in the Koiso Cabinet), Goko Kiyoshi of the Mitsubishi Group (who served as an advisor to the Tojo Cabinet), Yoshida Toshihiko of the Sumitomo Group (who served as an advisor to the Koiso Cabinet), and Ogura Masatsune, who served as the supreme economic advisor to the Wang Jingwei puppet government. On July 31st of the same year, MacArthur released Kuno Inosuke, the president of the fascist war advocate Nippon Dōmei, and Count Arima Yoriyasu, a representative figure of the Japanese feudal aristocracy and landlords, and an advisor to the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association." On August 30, 1947, MacArthur released another twenty-three important war criminals, including Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the munitions zaibatsu and former president of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Corporation who actively supported the war of aggression against China; Nakajima Chikuhei, the aircraft tycoon who served as an advisor to the "Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society" and a member of the "Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council"; Kobayashi Seizo, the former Governor-General of Taiwan and president of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society"; and General Masaki Jinzaburo, a reserve army general and rabid anti-Soviet aggressor, and Tokutomi Sohō, the mouthpiece of the fascist military, who were the organizers of the "February 26th" Japanese fascist "Young Officers" riot. On November 7, 1947, MacArthur arbitrarily released Kawanabe Masazo, Chief of Staff of the China Expeditionary Army and Commander of the General Air Force, Ota Masataka, Standing Secretary-General of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society" and Secretary-General of the "Greater Japan Political Society," and six Class A war criminal suspects, including the famous fascist figures Shiōten Nobutaka and Yokoyama Takeo. On February 27, 1948, MacArthur released Baba, the former commander of the Japanese army in New Guinea, and fourteen other war criminals.

　　The work of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in trying Japanese war criminals was vigorously delayed and obstructed by the American authorities, from May 1946 until November 1948 when the formal verdicts were handed down. Under the pressure of worldwide public opinion, the American authorities were forced to impose deserved punishments on seven of the twenty-five Class A war criminals, including Tojo, sentencing them to death. However, other eighteen major war criminals whose crimes were evident, such as Araki Sadao, instigator of the January 28th Incident, Hata Shunroku, former commander of the China Expeditionary Army who implemented the Three Alls Policy, Hashimoto Kingoro, who participated in the Nanjing Massacre, and Shigemitsu Mamoru, former Foreign Minister of the Tojo and Koiso Cabinets who presided over the Shanghai Truce, were only sentenced to life imprisonment, twenty years, or seven years, respectively. After the International Tribunal announced its verdicts, on December 24, 1948, MacArthur released all nineteen Class A war criminals imprisoned in Sugamo Prison who had not been indicted at the same time, including Nishio Shozo, former commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army, who had stained his hands with the blood of the Chinese people; Kodama Yoshio, former head of the Japanese Navy's special agency in Shanghai; Amau Eiji, former Foreign Minister and President of the Information Bureau; Kishi Nobusuke, former Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Tojo Cabinet and one of the important rulers of Japan in Manchuria; Tani Masayuki, former Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the Wang Jingwei puppet government; Aoki Kazuo, former Minister of Greater East Asia in the Tojo Cabinet and the highest economic advisor to the Wang government; and Ando Kisaburo, former Minister of Home Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet and Vice-President of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association," among others.

　　Not only that, MacArthur also colluded with the governments of various countries under American influence to release Japanese war criminals. In January 1949, MacArthur ordered the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government to declare Okamura Yasutsugu, the main Japanese war criminal who invaded China and the former commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army, not guilty. The other 260 war criminals were also repatriated to Japan. This February, after Japanese war criminals convicted by the Dutch Military Tribunal were repatriated to Tokyo from Indonesia, about 100 of them were released by MacArthur. In the same month, the American authorities also instigated the Commonwealth Government of Australia to decide to release three Japanese war criminal generals and forty-seven other officers who were originally to be submitted to the Australian Military Tribunal for trial.

　　On December 25th of last year, MacArthur announced the so-called "good behavior, reduced sentences" "release system." In less than two months, as far as is known, he has successively released four batches of war criminals, with the first batch releasing as many as 46 war criminals. The aforementioned war criminals who invaded Indonesia were also released by MacArthur under this "system" he himself had established.

　　MacArthur also protects Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, headed by Emperor Hirohito. When the Soviet Military Tribunal revealed last December the towering crimes of Japanese war criminals preparing and using bacteriological weapons, sentencing Yamada Otozo, Takahashi Takaatsu, Kajitsuka Ryuji, and twelve other bacteriological warfare criminals to deserved punishments, American imperialist elements, such as Keenan, former chief prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, openly defended them. The Soviet government's February 3rd proposal to entrust a special international military tribunal to try Hirohito, Ishii Shiro, Kitano Masazo, Wakamatsu Jiro, and Kasahara Yukio, five of the main Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, has been rejected by the U.S. State Department. MacArthur and his ilk are openly shielding Hirohito, the supreme director of preparing for bacteriological warfare. Under the protection and harboring of the United States, Ishii Shiro, the former commander of Unit 731, has "disappeared," while Kasahara Yukio, who led the preparation for bacteriological warfare during his tenure as Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, is disguised as the owner of a cosmetics store. All of these people are still at large.

　　MacArthur's announcement this time of the "sworn release system" is tantamount to announcing the abolition of all judgments made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the military tribunals of various Allied nations against Japanese war criminals. Even the arch-criminals who were announced last year as sentenced to life imprisonment, including Hata Shunroku, former Minister of the Army and supreme commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army, and sixteen others, as well as Tōgō Shigenori, former Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who was sentenced to twenty years in prison, will also be released. Shigemitsu Mamoru, who has been engaged in long-term activities of aggression against China, will be among the first to be released.

### 麦克阿瑟的滔天罪行

　　麦克阿瑟的滔天罪行
    一九四五年七月二十六日公布的波茨坦宣言，是对日作战的同盟国家所应遵循的最高原则。这个宣言关于处理日本战犯问题曾明白地规定：“我们无意奴役日本民族或消灭其国家，但对于战争罪犯，包括虐待俘虏者在内，将处以严厉的法律制裁。”但是，美国帝国主义政策在日本的执行人麦克阿瑟却完全蔑视这个规定，一贯采取扶植日本军国主义复活的政策，纵容与包庇着日本的战犯集团，并且自一九四六年六月起，明目张胆地开始擅自释放被捕或已被判决的大批战犯。麦克阿瑟更于三月七日公然宣布所谓“宣誓释放制度”，对已经盟国军事法庭判处罪刑的日本战犯，将全部加以释放。麦克阿瑟的这个滔天罪行，是中国人民以及爱好正义与和平的全世界人民所不能容忍的。
    如所周知，早在一九四六年六月间，麦克阿瑟就释放了一批积极支持日本侵略战争的主要财阀战犯，其中包括三井系的池田成彬（曾任策动“七、七”侵华战争的第一届近卫首度内阁的大藏大臣）、藤原银次郎（曾任东条内阁顾问和小矶内阁军需大臣）、三菱系的乡古洁（曾任东条内阁顾问）、住友系的吉田俊之助（曾任小矶内阁顾问），以及曾任汪逆精卫伪政府的最高经济顾问的小仓正恒。同年七月三十一日，麦克阿瑟又释放了法西斯战争的鼓吹者、日本同盟社社长古野伊之助，和“大政翼赞会”顾问、日本封建贵族、地主的代表人物有马赖宁伯爵。一九四七年八月三十日，麦克阿瑟又释放了二十三名重要战犯，其中有：积极支持对中国的侵略战争的军需财阀、前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介，曾任“翼赞政治会”顾问兼“大东亚建设审议会”委员的飞机大王中岛知久平，前台湾总督“翼赞政治会”总裁小林跻造，以及“二二六”日本法西斯“青年将校”暴动事件的主持人、疯狂的反苏侵略分子真崎甚三郎预备役陆军大将与法西斯军部喉舌德富苏峰等。一九四七年十一月七日，麦克阿瑟曾擅自释放中国派遣军参谋长、航空总军司令官河边正三，“翼赞政治会”常任总务、“大日本政治会”总务太田正孝及著名法西斯分子四王天延孝，横山雄伟等六名甲级战犯嫌疑犯。一九四八年二月二十七日，麦克阿瑟释放了前新几内亚日军司令官马场等十四名战犯。
    远东国际军事法庭审讯日本战犯的工作，曾受到美国当局的竭力拖延阻碍，从一九四六年五月起，直到一九四八年十一月才正式宣判。在全世界舆论的压力下，美国当局不得不将二十五名甲级战犯中东条等七人判处了应得的惩罚——死刑，但对其他十八名罪恶昭彰的主要战犯，如一二八侵华战争策动者荒木真夫、执行三光政策的前中国派遣军司令畑俊六、参与南京大屠杀的桥本欣五郎、主持淞沪协定的前东条与小矶内阁外相重光葵，则仅分别判处无期徒刑、二十年或七年徒刑。国际法庭宣判后，即在一九四八年十二月二十四日麦克阿瑟又将囚禁在巢鸭监狱内未被同时起诉的甲级战犯十九名全部释放，其中包括双手沾满了中国人民的鲜血的前中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造，前日本海军部在上海的特务机关长儿玉誉志夫，前外相及情报局总裁天羽英二，前东条内阁商工大臣与日本在满洲的重要统治者之一岸信介，前外相及驻汪逆精卫伪政府大使谷正之，前东条内阁大东亚大臣，驻汪政府最高经济顾问青木一男，以及前东条内阁内相、“大政翼赞会”副总裁安藤纪三郎等人。
    不仅如此，麦克阿瑟还勾结美国势力影响下的名国政府，释放日本战犯。一九四九年一月，麦克阿瑟叫蒋匪政府，把日本侵华主要战犯、前中国派遣军总司令岗村宁次宣判无罪。其他二百六十名战犯也遣返日本。今年二月，经荷兰军事法庭判决的日本战犯，自印尼遣返东京后，即被麦克阿瑟释放了一百名左右。同月，美国当局又唆使澳大利亚联邦政府决定释放原拟提交澳军事法庭审判的日本战犯将级军官三人及其他军官四十七人。
    去年十二月二十五日，麦克阿瑟宣布了所谓“行为良好，减轻罪行”的“释放制度”，在不及两月的时间内，据已知者已先后释放了四批战犯，其中第一次就释放了战犯四十六名之多。上述被释的侵略印尼的战犯，也是麦克阿瑟根据他自己所制订的这个“制度”释放的。
    麦克阿瑟还庇护着以日皇裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯。当苏联军事法庭在去年十二月揭露了日本战犯准备和使用细菌武器的滔天罪行，判处山田乙三、高桥高笃、梶冢龙二等十二名细菌战犯应得的惩处时，美帝国主义分子、前远东国际军事法庭首席检察官季南等人，都公然为他们辩护。苏联政府二月三日关于委任特别国际军事法庭审讯在日本的主要细菌战犯裕仁、石井四郎、北野政藏、若松次郎和笠原幸雄五人的建议，已为美国国务院拒绝，麦克阿瑟之流公然卵翼着准备细菌战的最高指使者裕仁。在美国的包庇窝藏下，前“七三一号部队”队长石井四郎“失踪”了，在关东军参谋长任期内领导准备细菌战工作的笠原幸雄则伪装作一家化妆品商店的店主。这些人现在都仍逍遥法外。
    麦克阿瑟这次宣布的“宣誓释放制度”，等于宣布废除远东国际军事法庭以及各盟国军事法庭对日本战犯所作的一切判决，甚至去年宣布被判处无期徒刑的元凶巨憝，包括前陆相、华中派遣军最高指挥官畑俊六等十六名，以及被判处徒刑二十年的前外相、驻苏大使东乡茂德，也都将被释放了。而从事长期侵华活动的重光葵，则将在第一批获释之列。【新华社北京十三日电】
