　　Peace Advocates' Front Grows Stronger
    Pravda on Achievements of the World Peace Council Standing Committee's Third Session
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] TASS, Moscow, 21st: Pravda published an editorial entitled "The Development and Strengthening of the Peace Advocates' Front," stating: The Third Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has resolved enormous and important tasks. The meeting summarized the work already done and put forward a program for further action in the future. These action programs are the two declarations unanimously adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the World Peace Council Standing Committee. The first declaration calls for an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and declares that any government that first uses atomic weapons to attack any country will be considered a war criminal.
    The second declaration calls on all people of goodwill to send representatives to the Second World Peace Congress.
    The results of the Standing Committee meeting show that the activities of peace advocates are growing, and the struggle for peace has entered a new stage, taking on more effective new forms.
    The working class is making a resolute contribution to this struggle. Dockworkers in France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands have refused to unload military supplies, thus providing a new way to fight against the arms race. Other workers are following their heroic example. Railway workers refuse to transport military supplies, industrial workers refuse to manufacture weapons, and the people support this movement.
    The deep contradiction between the will of the people who do not want war and the activities of the capitalist governments that are organizing new military gambles is becoming increasingly acute and clear. In the French National Assembly, the parties of the American camp—from right-wing Socialists to de Gaulle's followers—voted to approve the Franco-American agreement on the delivery of American weapons, but dockworkers in Marseille, Bordeaux, and Rouen refused to unload these weapons. The rulers of the Netherlands, under the brutal guard of military police, expelled the representatives of the World Peace Council Standing Committee, but dockworkers in Rotterdam and Amsterdam took the same action as dockworkers in Antwerp and distant Sydney. In England, Prime Minister Attlee refused to meet with representatives of the World Peace Council Standing Committee, but the words "Peace! Ban the atomic bomb!" appeared on the walls of the British Parliament. In the United States, Acheson did not allow representatives of the World Peace Council Standing Committee to enter the country, but the peace movement is unfolding in other new cities and states. The deepening of the rift between these two shows that as the movement for peace and national security grows, warmongers are becoming increasingly isolated.
    However, this does not mean that the danger of war has decreased. Let us not forget for a moment that the instigators of war have not relaxed but have intensified their activities. Let us not forget for a moment the barbaric nature of the imperialist plunderers, who, for the benefit of monopoly capitalists, are preparing to shed the people's blood and plunge humanity into a new war.
    Our task is to prevent the outbreak of a new war, thwart the sinister schemes of imperialism, and save humanity from new suffering and disasters. Our task is to expand the peace movement in every possible way and turn it into a force strong enough to contain any imperialist aggressor.
    The Standing Committee's declaration will surely receive the broadest support from millions of people in all countries of the world because the demands in the declaration are in line with the fundamental and vital interests of all nations and all mankind.

### 和平拥护者阵线发展壮大  真理报论和大常委会三次会议成就

　　和平拥护者阵线发展壮大
    真理报论和大常委会三次会议成就
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：真理报以《和平拥护者阵线的发展与壮大》为题发表社论称：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次会议已解决了巨大而重要的任务。会议总结了已作的工作，并提出了今后进一步的行动纲领。这些行动纲领就是和大常委会第三次全会所一致通过的两项宣言。第一项宣言要求无条件禁止原子武器，并宣布将认为头一个使用原子武器攻击任何国家的任何政府是战争罪犯。
    第二项宣言是号召一切善意的人们，派遣代表出席第二届世界拥护和平大会。
    常设委员会会议的结果显示：和平拥护者的活动正在成长，争取和平的斗争已经进入了新的阶段，它正采取更有效的新方式。
    工人阶级对于这一斗争正作着坚决的贡献。法国、意大利、比利时与荷兰的码头工人拒绝卸运军火，从而为反对军备竞赛的斗争提供了新的方式。其他工人也效法他们的英勇榜样。铁路工人拒绝运输军火，产业工人拒绝制造武器，人民也都支持这一运动。
    不要战争的人民的意志和正在组织新军事赌博的资本主义国家政府的活动之间的深刻矛盾，是越来越尖锐而明朗化了。在法国国民议会中，美国阵营的党派——从右翼社会党人到戴高乐的信徒，投票赞成批准法美关于交付美国武器的协定，但马赛、波尔多和卢昂的码头工人，则拒绝起卸这些武器。荷兰的统治者在宪兵警卫下粗暴地驱逐和大常委会的代表，但鹿特丹和阿姆斯特丹的码头工人，却采取和安特卫普与远方的悉尼的码头工人一样的行动。在英国，首相艾德礼拒绝接见和大常委会代表，但“和平！禁止原子弹！”的字句，却出现在英国议会的墙上。在美国，艾奇逊不许和大常委会代表入境，但拥护和平的运动却又在其他新的城市与州中展开。这两者之间裂痕的加深，说明随着拥护和平与民族安全运动的增长，战争贩子越发孤立了。
    然而，这并不是说战争的危险已经减少了。我们一刻也不要忘记战争挑拨者不但没有放松反而加紧了他们的活动，我们一刻也不要忘记帝国主义掠夺者的野蛮天性，他们为着垄断资本家的利益，准备让人民血流成河，把人类投入新战争。
    我们的任务是不准发动一个新战争，挫败帝国主义的罪恶阴谋，拯救人类免于新的痛苦及灾难。我们的任务就是用各种方法扩展和平运动，并把它变成足以遏制任何帝国主义侵略者的力量。
    常设委员会的宣言必将得到世界各国百万计的人民最广大的支持，因为宣言上的要求，是符合一切民族、全体人类的基本切身利益的。
