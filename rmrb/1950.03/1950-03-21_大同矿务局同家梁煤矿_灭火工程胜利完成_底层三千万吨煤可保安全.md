　　Datong Mining Bureau Tongjialiang Coal Mine
    Fire Extinguishing Project Successfully Completed
    30 Million Tons of Coal in the Bottom Layer Can Be Kept Safe
    [Reported by this newspaper] The fire extinguishing project at the Tongjialiang Coal Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau was basically completed at the end of February, ensuring the safety of the E-layer's reserves of more than 29.12 million tons of coal.
    The area around the D-layer coal pillar of Well No. 2 of the mine caught fire in mid-March 1948 due to an electrical fault, covering an area of 240 square meters. Well No. 2 is the main transportation route for coal mining in the E-layer, so whether the fire could be extinguished was crucial to the continued mining of the mine. Under the leadership of Deputy Mine Director Tian Zhibin and Engineer Li Rong, 84 workers were organized to start extinguishing the fire last November. During the three-month fire extinguishing process, all the firefighters demonstrated a high degree of spirit in cherishing the property of the motherland. Under the high temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, although each group could only work for a few minutes, and the acidic water dripping inside the well constantly eroded their clothes, the workers actively found ways to overcome all these dangers and difficulties. Because the fire was so large that the stones eight meters away were too hot to touch, it would have been too dangerous to break the stones by blasting as in the past. However, in order to ensure the safety of the firefighters, the rotten stones had to be broken down. Old worker Guo Yao came up with a method of cutting the fuse in half, which overcame this difficulty. At the same time, the wind direction was adjusted so that the flow of smoke was in the opposite direction to the work of the firefighters, in order to facilitate the fire extinguishing work. Now, the mine has completed the encirclement of the 360-cubic-meter fire area without any casualties. To this end, the Datong Mining Bureau held a celebration meeting and awarded the fire brigade a red flag for "Successfully Completing the First Phase of the Fire Extinguishing Project," and gave material rewards. The reason why the fire extinguishing project was successfully completed was mainly because fire extinguishing tools, gas masks, etc. were fully prepared before the fire extinguishing, and a rescue team was organized. The engineer personally trained the firefighters, breaking the fear among some workers. The engineer and the deputy mine director also went deep into the site to encourage the workers to extinguish the fire with practical actions. (Lin Wei)

　　大同矿务局同家梁煤矿
    灭火工程胜利完成
    底层三千万吨煤可保安全
    【本报讯】大同矿务局同家梁煤矿灭火工程于二月底已基本完成，保证了Ｅ层两千九百一十二万余吨煤藏量的安全。
    该矿二号井Ｄ层煤柱周围，于一九四八年三月中旬因走电引起火灾，面积二百四十平方米。该二号井是Ｅ层采煤总运输道，所以火灾能否扑灭，对该矿的继续开采具有决定意义。在副矿长田志斌和工程师李榕领导下，于去年十一月组织了八十四名工友开始灭火。在三个月的灭火过程中，救火队全体工人表现了高度爱护祖国财产的精神。在摄氏四十度的高温下，虽然每组只能工作几分钟，井内滴下的酸性水，随时浸蚀着衣服，但这一切危险和困难，工人们都积极设法加以克服了。由于火势浩大，八米之外的石头已烫得不敢摸，如果仍用过去采煤放炮的办法打石头，危险性太大；可是，为了灭火工人的安全，又必须把烂石头打下来。老工人郭要想出了把导火线截断一半的方法，克服了这个困难。同时调动了风向，使火烟流动与救火队工作成相反方向，以便灭火工作的进行。现在，该矿毫无伤亡的完成了包围三百六十方公尺的火区。为此，大同矿务局，曾召开庆祝大会，奖予救火队“胜利完成第一期救火工程”的一面红旗，并给予物资奖励。灭火工程之所以顺利完成，主要是在灭火之前，充分准备了灭火工具，防毒面具等，并组织救护队，工程师亲自对救火工人进行了训练，打破了部分工人中的畏怯思想，工程师和副矿长也同时深入现场，以实际行动鼓舞了工人灭火的勇气。（林巍）
