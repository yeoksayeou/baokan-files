The Political Department of the Chahar Provincial Military Region Inspects Wasteful Spending
Based on the Spirit of Thrift, Makes Five Decisions

[News from this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily on March 15th: The Political Department of the Chahar Provincial Military Region conducted a major inspection of expenditures for the past six months and discovered that the waste and damage of electric lights, tap water, glass windows, and daily necessities alone could be converted into 19,000 catties of rice. The main reason for this serious loss is insufficient education on cherishing public property on weekdays, and the lack of concern for thrift among all comrades. Sometimes, for personal gain, public property is intentionally or unintentionally damaged, such as using kettles as urinals, turning on several lights for one person to work, and only using objects without regard for preservation. On the other hand, the leadership lacked sufficient understanding of long-term construction, and the things they made and purchased were not strong or durable. At the same time, administrative management was not strict, and criticisms and education were not carried out in a timely manner. Based on this inspection, thorough mobilization and education were carried out at branch meetings and soldiers' congresses. The Production and Economic Committee also made leading thrift one of its main tasks and made the following decisions based on the spirit of thrift: 1. Strictly manage electric lights, with designated personnel in charge of the light switches, and dormitory lights will not be turned on during office hours at night. 2. Strictly manage coal, with designated personnel responsible for sifting coal slag. 3. Pay attention to hooking doors and windows when opening and closing them to avoid damaging the glass. 4. Clearly define rewards and punishments, praise the good, and criticize and educate the bad at any time. 5. Regularly inspect and urge the cherishing of public property.

　　察省军区政治部检查开支浪费现象
    根据节约精神作出五项决定
    【本报讯】据三月十五日察哈尔日报消息：察省军区政治部对半年来开支进行了一次大检查，发现仅电灯、自来水、玻璃窗及日常用品的浪费与损坏，即可折米一万九千斤。造成这个严重损失的主要原因，在于平日对爱护公共财产的教育不够，全体同志对节约不关心。有时为了个人利益，即有意无意地对公物加以破坏，如把水壶当了尿桶，一个人做事点好几个灯，对物件仅管使用不管保存等。另一方面，领导上对长期建设认识不足，制购的东西不坚固不耐用，同时行政管理不严，没有及时进行批评与教育。根据这一次的检查，在支部与军人大会上进行了充分的动员与教育，生产经济委员会也把领导节约作为主要任务之一，并根据节约精神作了以下的决定：一、严格管理电灯，专人掌握电门开关，晚上办公时间内宿舍不开电门。二、严格煤炭管理，由专人负责筛煤渣。三、门窗开关要注意上钩，以免损坏玻璃。四、奖罚严明，好的进行表扬，坏的随时批评教育。五、随时检查督促爱惜公物。
