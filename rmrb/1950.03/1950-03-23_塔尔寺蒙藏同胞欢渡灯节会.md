　　At the Ta'er Monastery Lantern Festival in Qinghai, filled with the spirit of unity and friendship, gathered Mong and Tibetan compatriots from various counties in Qinghai, as well as Tibetan people from Labrang in Gansu and Tibet. They celebrated their first festival after liberation with great joy. From the twelfth day of the first lunar month, Ta'er Monastery and the Rushar area were swept into a frenzy of revelry. Everywhere there were crowds of people like tides, and loudspeakers constantly broadcast Tibetan songs, Qinghai folk tunes, and various other songs of liberation. As Gengdeng Zuoba of Ta'er Monastery said: "This year is a year of victory, unlike previous years, we must have a lively celebration." Mong and Tibetan compatriots wholeheartedly support the Communist Party and the People's Government in respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities and implementing freedom of religious belief. They hung colorful portraits of leaders and photos of the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army on the nearby walls to express their loyal support. Mong and Tibetan compatriots pointed to the picture of "Great Unity of All Nationalities" and said: Look! So many of our nationalities, everyone is close together, like a family! The film projection team continuously showed films such as "Newsletter No. 2" and "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River" at Ta'er Monastery and Rushar, which further inspired the enthusiasm of the audience. When Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the venue was immediately filled with thunderous applause, showing the respect and love of all ethnic groups for their leader. The villagers pointed to the cannons on the screen in surprise and excitement and said: "Look how big this cannon is! Let the bandits and secret agents see it and it will scare them out of their wits." The cultural troupe of the garrison troops started the Yangko dance from the thirteenth and performed several dramas. Students from the Qinghai Provincial Youth Cadre Training Class also rushed from Xining on foot on the fourteenth to participate in the grand event. The Tibetan dance performed by the students was especially welcomed by the Mong and Tibetan compatriots. This year, people no longer see arrogant and vicious Ma bandits, but amiable and loving People's Liberation Army soldiers. In the past, cunning merchants deliberately raised prices and extra exploited Mong and Tibetan compatriots from afar; this year, the People's Government made appropriate measures in advance, and the trading company sold various items at reasonable prices, so that Mong and Tibetan compatriots could get equal transactions. For example, in the past, one catty of wool could only be exchanged for one piece of tea, but now it can be exchanged for four pieces.

　　塔尔寺蒙藏同胞欢渡灯节会
    充满着团结友爱精神的青海塔尔寺灯节会上，聚集了来自青海各县的蒙藏同胞和来自甘肃拉卜楞以及西藏的藏民。他们以极愉快的心情，庆贺解放后的第一个节日。从农历正月十二日起，塔尔寺及鲁沙尔一带，就卷入狂欢的热潮里。到处是潮水般的人群，扩音器不时地在播送藏曲、青海小调及各种其他的解放歌曲。诚如塔尔寺更登作巴所说的：“今年是胜利年，不比往年，我们一定要热闹热闹。”蒙藏同胞们衷心拥护共产党与人民政府尊重少数民族风俗习惯和实行宗教信仰自由。他们在附近的墙壁上挂满了彩色的首长画像和解放军英勇战斗的照片，表示他们的忠诚拥护。蒙藏同胞指着《各民族大团结》的图画说：看！咱们这许多民族，大家靠得紧紧的，像是一家人！电影放映队连续在塔尔寺及鲁沙尔放映了《简报第二号》及《百万雄师下江南》等影片，更鼓舞了观众的热情。当毛主席在银幕中出现时，会场上顿时掀起了暴风雨似的掌声，显示各族人民对自己的领袖的尊敬与爱戴。老乡们指着银幕上的大炮惊讶而兴奋地说：“你看这炮有多大！叫土匪特务们看看，真吓破他们的胆子。”驻军文工团从十三日就闹起秧歌来，并上演了几个话剧。青海省青年干部训练班的学生也于十四日从西宁徒步赶来参加盛会，同学们的藏族舞尤为蒙藏同胞所欢迎。在今年，人们已看不到骄横凶恶的马匪军队，而是和蔼可亲热爱人民的解放军。往年，狡诈的商人故意抬高物价，额外剥削远道而来的蒙藏同胞；今年，人民政府预先作了妥善的措施，贸易公司以合理的价格出售各种物品，使蒙藏同胞得到平等的交易。例如过去一斤羊毛只能换一块茶，现在可以换到四块。
