　　Northeast Xinmin County Relies on Production for Self-Relief:
    100,000 Disaster Victims Can Survive the Spring Famine
    [This newspaper reports] Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, which suffered severe flooding last year, is expected to help 100,000 disaster victims survive the spring famine by extensively carrying out a production self-relief campaign. In Camel Village, the most severely affected area of the county's Thirteenth District, more than 80% of the farmers participated in sideline production. From November of last year to the present, they have earned more than 200,000 catties of grain. Currently, all households in the village have enough food and have a surplus of more than 20,000 catties of grain. If the farmers in the village continue production until the end of March, they can victoriously overcome the spring and summer grain shortage this year. In Xiaobaibao Village, representative of the county's general disaster areas, more than 1,000 people were organized to participate in sideline production. From December of last year to January 20 of this year, they earned 808 million yuan (Northeast currency), equivalent to more than 530 *shi* of grain. It is planned that by the end of February, they can earn 600 *shi* of grain, and the entire village can survive the spring and summer grain shortage. According to statistics from eight villages in the county's Thirteenth District, more than 11,400 *shi* of grain have been exchanged through the district and village cooperatives' sales of sideline products. In order to combine sideline production with spring plowing preparations, the county's People's Government proposed using income from sideline production to solve the difficulties of production and living materials, and called on disaster victims in various places to plant more early-maturing crops to shorten the spring famine.

　　东北新民县经过生产自救
    十万灾民可渡春荒
    【本报讯】去年遭严重水灾的辽西省新民县，经过广泛开展生产自救运动，十万灾民可望渡过春荒。代表该县重灾区的十三区骆驼村，全村百分之八十以上农民参加了副业生产，去年十一月至现在已挣粮二十余万斤，目前全村各户已不缺吃粮，并余粮食二万多斤。如该村农民继续生产到三月底，即可胜利渡过今年春夏粮荒。代表该县一般灾区的小白旗堡村，组织起来参加副业生产的有一千多人，自去年十二月至今年一月二十日，已挣八亿零八百万元（东北币），折合粮食五百三十余石。计划生产到二月末，可挣粮六百石，全村春夏粮荒即可渡过。根据该县十三区八个村的统计，经过区、村合作社推销出的副业产品，已换回粮食一万一千四百多石。为使副业生产与春耕准备结合，该县人民政府提出把副业生产收入用于解决生产与生活资料困难，并号召各地灾民多种早熟作物，缩短春荒。
