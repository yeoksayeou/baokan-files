　　US Imperialism Intensifies Suppression of Democracy
    Justice Department Conspires to Mass Arrest Communists, Robertson Barred From TV Discussion
    (Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th) According to TASS, New York, 18th: If the US Supreme Court upholds the New York Federal Court's original sentence against eleven leaders of the American Communist Party last year, the US Justice Department intends to arrest and prosecute at least 12,000 communists. Acting Assistant Attorney General Hortie revealed this plan during a secret meeting of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on January 12th. The minutes of the subcommittee meeting were only recently released. While requesting a larger appropriation for the Justice Department, Hortie said that the US Supreme Court might take action on the appeal of the eleven convicted communist leaders in the fall of this year or the spring of next year. If the court upholds the original sentence, the Justice Department is prepared to indict 12,000 communists around July 1, 1950.
    It is reported that after the eleven American Communist leaders were sentenced on October 21st of last year by Medina, the reactionary judge of the New York Federal Court, on the so-called charge of "inciting the violent overthrow of the United States," the American Communist leaders immediately appealed to the US Supreme Court. According to the United Press, the US Supreme Court has set early June of this year as the period for the hearing of the appeal of the eleven American Communist leaders.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 19th) TASS, New York, 16th: The American reactionaries are intensifying their anti-democratic movement in all aspects of American life. Under pressure from the reactionaries, the National Broadcasting Company of the United States announced an indefinite suspension of Robertson's television program scheduled for the 19th to discuss "The Position of Black People in American Political Life." An amendment to the bill passed by the House of Representatives last week regarding the establishment of a "National Science Foundation" orders the FBI to investigate the "loyalty" of all students studying science who receive scholarships under this bill. The president of the Federation of American Scientists, physicist Woolf, issued a statement on this matter, pointing out that the FBI will become the detective, judge, and jury against students studying science, "which is closer to the philosophy of a police state than anything ever proposed in American history." At the same time, the attack on the freedom of teachers continues under the guise of eliminating "communists" from the teaching profession. The New York State Supreme Court upholds the notorious Feinberg Law. (Note: The Feinberg Law, passed last April, stipulates the purge of all progressive elements from New York schools and orders the education authorities to dismiss all personnel listed on the "subversive group" list. This bill has been opposed by the broad American people.)

　　美帝加紧摧残民主
    司法部阴谋大捕共产党人  罗伯逊不能参加电视讨论
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：如果美国最高法院维持纽约联邦法院去年对美国共产党十一位领袖的原判，美国司法部打算至少逮捕和检举一万二千名共产党人。司法部代理助理部长霍尔梯于一月十二日在众院拨款小组委员会的秘密会议上作证时，透露了这种计划。该小组委员会的会议纪录至最近始予公布。霍尔梯在为司法部要求更大数目的拨款时说，美国最高法院或将在今年秋季或明年春季，对被判刑的十一位共产党领袖的上诉采取行动。如果法院维持原判，司法部准备在一九五○年七月一日左右，检举一万二千名共产党人。
    按十一位美共领袖于去年十月二十一日被纽约联邦法院的反动法官麦迪纳判以所谓“教唆以暴力颠覆美国”罪后，美共领袖即向美国最高法院提起上诉。据合众社报道，美国最高法院已定今年六月初为十一位美共领袖上诉辩论期。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国反动派在美国生活的一切方面，加紧进行反民主运动。在反动派的压力下，美国的全国广播公司宣布无限期地停止罗伯逊预定在十九日参加的讨论“黑人在美国政治生活中的地位”的电视节目。上星期众议院通过的关于建立“全国科学基金”议案中有一项修正条款是命令联邦调查局对在此议案下接受奖学金的一切研究科学的学生是否“忠诚”，进行调查。美国科学家联合会主席、物理学家伍尔夫就此事发表声明，指出联邦调查局将变成对付研究科学的学生的侦探、法官和陪审官，“这比美国历史上提出过的任何东西都更加近似警察国家的哲学。”同时对于教师自由的进攻，也继续在剔除教师中的“共产党人”的伪装下进行。纽约州最高法院维护着臭名昭彰的费格堡法。（按费格堡法于去年四月通过，规定肃清纽约各院校的一切进步分子，并命令教育当局将列名于“破坏团体”名单上的人员一律开除。该法案曾遭受广大的美国人民的反对。）
