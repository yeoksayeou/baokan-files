　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Qingdao: Qingdao's inventory of materials, which lasted three months, was completed at the end of January. In early November of last year, Qingdao established a Materials Inventory Committee, with a total of fifteen members, with Mayor Ma Baosan and Director of the Finance Bureau, Li Mu, serving as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. The Inventory Committee had an accounting and a secretarial department, responsible for handling expenditures, transfers, audits, final reports, and external liaison. It also had a First and Second sub-committee. Each sub-committee was composed of a provincial bureau work team and takeover personnel from various departments, working with existing employees to form inventory work teams or inventory groups to carry out the work separately. In addition, all departments under the Military Control Commission independently established their own work teams, with the financial and production departments also joined by a group from the provincial work team to assist. The inventory steps were roughly divided into three stages: the first two months, from the beginning to the end of the year, were for general inventory, spot checks, and "sweeping-style" inventory; the middle of January was for creating registers; and the final stage was for reporting and summarizing, establishing a general warehouse, and ending the work of the Inventory Committee.

　　Before the inventory work began, under the unified leadership of the Inventory Committee, cadres from each work team promoted full deliberation and discussion in each unit, enabling cadres and the masses to overcome the erroneous views of some units such as "there is nothing to check" and "we are too busy to carry out the work". They correctly recognized the importance of cherishing state property, implementing economic accounting, and unified state management of property. After this ideological and organizational preparation, the comprehensive cleaning work began immediately.

　　During the inventory process, the general inventory was generally carried out by a combination of cadres, technicians, and workers. The close cooperation of cadres leading and promoting the overall work, technicians identifying and classifying equipment, and workers actively cherishing property ensured the rapid completion of the inventory work. In order to correctly estimate the accuracy of the inventory, spot checks were carried out immediately after the general inventory. According to the results of the spot checks, the estimated accuracy of the inventory was generally around 60 to 80 percent. After the inventory of important complete materials, a "sweeping-style" inventory was carried out on scattered parts everywhere. Even a small screw had to be cleaned up. Initially, this work was not taken seriously, but as a result, many usable materials were swept out from the ground, corners, ditches, sewers, and debris piles, giving employees a valuable lesson in experience.

　　The combination of inventory, allocation, and sales ensured that time-sensitive materials, such as medicines and chemicals, were handled in a timely manner without disrupting the inventory process. Fragments, broken items, and expiring materials were also quickly sold to prevent further loss of materials.

　　The main gains of this inventory were, first, that it generally improved the employees' care for state materials, thereby reducing waste. For example, after this inventory, China Textile immediately launched a waste material cleaning campaign, which allowed a large number of things that were discarded and considered useless during the Kuomintang rule to play a significant role again. Second, the procedures for material allocation were determined, and the disorder in expenditure was eliminated. In terms of material storage, there was a more detailed classification, and the storage of materials in each warehouse was also better than before. For example, after China Textile Factory No. 5 established a strict warehouse management system, not only were all kinds of machine parts and miscellaneous items placed in an orderly manner, but the materials that used to take up three warehouses were stored in only one warehouse, freeing up two warehouses for raw cotton.

　　The total value of materials cleared in the city this time was approximately 166.2 billion yuan. Among them, the property of the enterprise sector was approximately 131.3 billion yuan (based on the estimated value after takeover in August last year); the materials in the original puppet Materials Supply Bureau warehouse were worth approximately 34.9 billion yuan (based on the price valuation on December 15 last year). In this way, on the one hand, the necessary steps for the state to uniformly manage and utilize national materials were completed; on the other hand, each enterprise department also had a more accurate estimate of its own funds, laying the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system.

### 干部技师工人密切配合青岛完成物资清点工作  查出物资值千六百余亿元

　　干部技师工人密切配合青岛完成物资清点工作
    查出物资值千六百余亿元
    【新华社讯】青岛消息：青岛市清查物资工作，历时三个月，已于一月底完成。去年十一月初，青市成立了物资清查委员会，共有委员十五人，由马保三市长及财政局李慕局长分任正副主任。清委会内设会计、秘书两处，分别处理支拨、转账、审核、结报及对外联系等项工作，下设第一、第二两分会；各分会由省分局工作队及各部门接管人员配合旧有职工组成清查工作队或清查小组，分头进行工作。此外，军管会所属各部均单独由各该部门自行成立工作队，其中金融、生产两部则另外加入省工作队的一个组协助进行。清查步骤大体分为三个阶段：自开始至年底的两个月，是普遍清点，抽查和“扫地式”的清点；一月中旬进行造册；最后进行汇报和总结，成立总仓库，结束清委会工作。
    清查工作开始前，在清委会统一领导下，由各工作队干部推动各单位进行了充分的酝酿和讨论，使干部和群众克服了个别单位的“没什么可查”，“业务太忙，无法进行”等错误观点，而正确认识到爱护国家资财、实行经济核算和国家统一管理资财的重要意义。在这一思想上和组织上的准备工作完成后，即时全面开始了清理工作。
    在清点过程中，普遍清点一般均由干部、技术人员和工人三方结合进行。由于干部对整个工作的领导与推进，技术人员对器材的识别、分类和工人爱护资财的积极行动三者力量的密切配合，保证了清点工作的迅速完成。为了正确地估计清点的准确性，在普遍清点结束后，即时进行了抽查，根据抽查结果，估计清点的准确程度一般均在百分之六十至八十左右。在重要的成件的物资清点后，对遗散各处的零碎机件，又作“扫地式”的清点，小至一个螺丝钉也要清理打扫出来。起初这一工作不被重视，但结果在各处地上、墙角、水坑、下水道和杂物堆中扫出了许多可用的物资，使职工在经验方面得到了一个可贵的教训。
    清理、批拨和出售的结合，使有时间性的物资，如药品、化学品等，均在不扰乱清点的原则下及时作了处理；零碎、破烂和将失效用的物资，亦迅速出售，防止了物资的继续损失。
    此次清查的主要收获，首先是普遍提高了职工们对国家物资的爱护，从而减少了浪费现象。如中纺在此次清查后，即时掀起了清理废料运动，使在国民党统治时期被大批弃置认为没有用的东西，又发挥了很大的作用。其次是确定了物资调拨手续，消灭了支拨的紊乱现象；在物资保管方面，有了比较详密的分类，各仓库对物资的存放也都比以前妥善了。如中纺五厂在制订了严密的仓库保管制度之后，不但各类机件、杂品放得井井有条，且将过去用三个仓库的物资仅用一个仓库便放下了，腾出两个，做了原棉仓库。
    这次全市共清查出物资总额约值一千六百六十二亿元。其中企业部门资财约为一千三百十三亿元（按去年八月份接管后的估值）；原伪物资供应局仓库物资约值三百四十九亿元（按去年十二月十五日物价估值）。这样，一方面完成了国家统一管理和运用全国物资的必要步骤；另方面使各企业部门对其本部门的资金也有了比较正确的估计，为实行经济核算制打下了基础。
