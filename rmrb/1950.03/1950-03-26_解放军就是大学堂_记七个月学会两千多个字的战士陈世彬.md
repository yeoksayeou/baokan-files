　　The People's Liberation Army is a Great School
    —On Soldier Chen Shibin Learning Over Two Thousand Characters in Seven Months
    By Our Correspondent Zhao Wenbin

    Chen Shibin is a soldier in the Seventh Platoon, Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. He is from Sichuan Province and is twenty-six years old this year. His family didn't own a single room or plot of land. He begged for food with his parents from childhood, living in a stone cave. His mother died when he was nine. At sixteen, he went to Chongqing to learn plastering, doing hard labor repairing houses for others. Because he couldn't read, he was often cheated when he was paid. In the autumn of his twenty-third year, he was conscripted into the Kuomintang army and transported all the way to North China, where he was assigned to the bandit 16th Army. He was constantly scolded and beaten, and still bears the scars from being shot by the Kuomintang army platoon leader with a submachine gun.

    After the liberation of Beijing, he was incorporated into the Independent 25th Division of the People's Liberation Army, starting a new life. He earned a merit in the Taiyuan Campaign.

    His twenty-fifth year was his happiest. In May, he was assigned to the Seventh Platoon, Third Company of a certain main force regiment. He earned a merit himself and also learned over a hundred characters. When the unit began training, the political instructor mobilized everyone to study, saying, "In the past, because our families were poor, we couldn't afford to go to school. The People's Liberation Army is a great school." He always felt that the political instructor was talking about him, and he resolved to study hard. In addition to diligently studying the materials taught by the cultural instructor, he also bought a dictionary, looked up new characters in the dictionary, and learned ten or eight a day, memorizing over four hundred characters in two months. However, he couldn't use these memorized characters. He could write them but couldn't speak them, and couldn't even write a simple wall newspaper article.

    After last year's "August 1st" (Army Day), formal cultural education began. He was assigned to Literacy Class B (for those who knew two hundred to five hundred characters). He changed his past learning methods and discovered a new approach: learn what you need, learn what you do. When on duty buying vegetables, learn to keep accounts; after returning from guard duty, write "guard duty"; when carrying water for the villagers, write the landlord's name and the words "carry water"; in the machine gun squad, learn to write the names of the parts of the machine gun; when someone in the platoon performed well, write the words of praise on paper; when the political instructor gave a political lesson, take notes on the central ideas and discussion questions. When he encountered a character he didn't know how to write, he would ask the study group leader or other comrades, and find a student from the landlord's family to be his teacher. Then, he wrote a personal self-criticism every week. When the New China was founded, he wrote his thoughts on the New China. After his hometown—Wudang, Sichuan—was liberated, he wrote a letter home to inquire about his family, writing a five-hundred-character letter for the first time.

    "Giving up smoking is okay, but not knowing how to read is not." Chen Shibin picked up the habit of smoking paper cigarettes in the Kuomintang army. Now, in order to study, he quit smoking and used the money he saved to buy four fountain pens, three writing brushes, an inkstone, a slate, twenty sheets of paper, and many notebooks. "Chen Shibin has a lot of notebooks." This is what the soldiers of the Third Company often said. He takes notes on military affairs, politics, and culture, and also has a diary, a review notebook, an exercise book, etc., a total of seven or eight large notebooks.

    He selects and reads articles from the *Pioneer News* and *Comrade-in-Arms*. He studies the unit's "Three-Character Classic." He learns character by character, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, and asks people about characters he doesn't recognize, learning more than a dozen new characters from books and newspapers every day. He has finished learning the "Three-Character Classic," and there are fewer and fewer new characters in the *Comrade-in-Arms* and *Pioneer News*. From then on, he became more interested in the *Comrade-in-Arms* and *Pioneer News*, and didn't put it down during game time and extracurricular activities. Sometimes, in order to remember new characters, he would draw twice while defecating in the toilet.

    Mastering the "four skills" (being able to write, read, speak, and use) is an important reason for Chen Shibin's rapid progress. The company puts out a wall newspaper every week, and the platoon has a door panel newspaper. He boldly writes articles for them, practicing using the words and sentences he has learned. The company's wall newspaper has his articles every week. At first, he wrote some clappers and doggerel, reciting and writing at the same time. He would ask people about characters he didn't know how to write, and learned new characters from practical application. Later, he submitted two articles to the *Pioneer News* published by the military, and the regiment's political department officially hired him as a correspondent for the regiment. He also helps his comrades write letters, which is also a way for him to practice writing.

    His learning is planned. On January 7th of this year, he set a plan to learn 1,500 characters throughout the year, and secretly calculated: "In three or four years, I will become a senior elementary school student," "Being able to write and read will no longer be difficult." Thanks to his hard work, he not only completed the plan, but also exceeded it. He has been promoted from Literacy Class B to Literacy Class A, and from Literacy Class A to the elementary class. In seven months of study, he has learned more than two thousand characters, can write letters and articles, and has learned addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in arithmetic.

    Chen Shibin not only studies hard himself, but also patiently helps others study. The Tenth Platoon created the experience of signing learning contracts, and the company branch promptly promoted it. Comrade Chen Shibin signed a contract with his platoon's deputy leader, Liu Fuxiang, and the forty-five-year-old Yang Weixin, who was unwilling to study culture, to teach them four characters a day. With his help, Liu and Yang learned more than two hundred characters in two months.

    Chen Shibin is not only a model of cultural learning, but also a model of loving the people. He personally experienced that the People's Liberation Army is his home, so he cherishes the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army as a family treasure. In the midst of intense training, he provides drinking water for ten families of orphans, widows, the elderly, the weak, and military dependents, and washes the villagers' water tanks every three days. During the Spring Festival, the masses presented him with a silk banner, calling him "Chen Shibin, a hero of loving the people and working." The villagers in Liberation Street all said: "Shibin is a good child." Chen Shibin said: "The People's Liberation Army saved me, so I am determined to be a good soldier of the people." Chen Shibin's deeds spread throughout the army. The *Pioneer News* and pictorial magazine published by the military political department have successively praised him. At last year's autumn sports meeting, he received a certificate of merit from the division. He was continuously elected as a representative at the regiment and division's worker-study representative meetings. At the end of the training, he was awarded two minor merits and was recommended as a training model. Due to his increased awareness, his efforts in cultural learning, and his realization that the Communist Party is his savior, he voluntarily wrote an application to join the Party. The branch discussed his history and his performance after liberation in detail, and agreed to admit him to the Party and reported it to the higher Party committee for review. Chen Shibin is advancing happily and vigorously.

　　解放军就是大学堂
    ——记七个月学会两千多个字的战士陈世彬
    本报通讯员  赵文彬
    陈世彬是人民解放军某部三连七班战士，四川省人，今年二十六岁，家中房无一间，地无一垅，自小跟着爹娘讨饭，住在一个石洞里。九岁时死了娘。十六岁就到重庆去学泥水匠，给人家修房做苦工。因为不识字，给工钱的时候常常受骗。二十三岁那年秋天，被国民党抓了兵，一直运到华北，补到匪十六军。成天受骂挨打，身上还遗留着被匪军排长用冲锋枪打的伤痕。
    北京解放后，他被编入人民解放军独立二十五师，从此开始了崭新的生活。在太原战役中立了一功。
    二十五岁是他最愉快的一年，五月被编入主力某团三连七班，自己立了功还学会了一百多字。部队练兵了，指导员动员大家学习说：“过去因为我们家穷，上不起学，解放军就是大学堂。”他总觉着指导员说的就是他，自己就下定了决心努力学习。除了用心学习文化教员教的材料以外，自己还买了本字典，从字典上找生字，一天十个八个的学，两个月记住了四百多字。但是，死记了这些字不能用，会写不会讲，连个简单的墙报稿也不能写。
    去年“八一”以后，正规的文化教育开始了。他被编入识字乙班（识二百至五百字者）。他改变了过去的学习方法，摸索到新的门路：要什么学什么，干什么学什么。值勤买菜时学记账；站岗回来就写“站岗”；给老乡担水时就写房东的姓名和“担水”等字；自己在机枪班就学写机枪的各部名称；班内谁表现好，就把要表扬的话写在纸上；指导员讲政治课，就记中心和讨论题。遇到不会写的字就问学习组长或别的同志，并找房东家的学生当自己的教员。接着，他每周写一次个人的检讨。新中国成立时，他写了对新中国的感想。他的家乡—四川武当解放之后，就写家信问候，首次就写成了一封五百字的信。
    “不吸烟行，不识字可不行。”陈世彬在国民党军队里染上了吸纸烟的嗜好；现在，他为了学习把烟戒了，把省出来的钱买了四枝钢笔、三枝毛笔、一块砚台、一块石板、二十张纸和许多笔记本。“陈世彬的本子一大罗。”这是三连战士们常常说的。他学习军事、政治、文化都有笔记，还有日记本、复习本、练习本等，一共七八个大本子。
    他从《前锋报》和《战友》上选读文章；学习部队“三字经”。从字到句，由句到全文，逐字逐句逐段的学习，不认识的字写下来问人，每天要从书报上学会十几个生字。“三字经”已经学完了，“战友”和“前锋报”的生字也少了。从此他对“战友”和“前锋报”更发生兴趣，在游戏时间与课外活动时间都不放下它。有时为了记生字，在厕所大便还画两次。
    掌握四会（会写、会念、会讲、会用）是陈世彬进步快的重要原因。连队每周出墙报，班内有门板报，他大胆的为它们写稿，练习运用所学的字句。连的墙报每周都有他的稿。起初写些快板和顺口流，边念边写，不会写的字就问人，从实用中又学了生字。后来，他向军出版的“前锋报”投寄了稿件两篇，团政治处已正式聘请他为团的通讯员。他还帮助同志们写信，这也是他练习写作的一个方法。
    他的学习是有计划的。今年一月七日，就订出了全年学会一千五百字的计划，并暗打盘算：“三四年就要成高小生”，“能写能看再也不遭难”。由于他的努力学习，他不但完成了计划，而且超过了计划，他已从识字乙班升到识字甲班，又由识字甲班升到初级班了。七个月的学习，他学了两千多个字，能够写信写稿，算术学会了加减乘法。
    陈世彬不但自己努力学习，并能耐心帮助别人学习。第十班创造了订学习合同书的经验，连支部及时进行了推广。陈世彬同志就和他班的副班长刘福祥、四十五岁不愿学文化的杨维新订了每天教他俩四个字的合同书。在他的帮助下，刘杨二人在两个月内都学会了二百多字。
    陈世彬不仅是文化学习的模范，而且是爱民的模范。他亲身体验到人民解放军就是自己的家，因此他对人民解放军的光荣传统也视如传家之宝。他在紧张的练兵中，供着十家孤寡老弱和军属的吃水，每隔三天还给老乡洗一次缸。春节群众送给他锦旗一面，称他为“爱民劳动英雄陈世彬”。解放街老乡们都说：“世彬是个好孩子。”陈世彬说：“解放军救了我，我就坚决当一个人民的好战士。”陈世彬的事迹传遍了全军，军政治部出版的：“前锋报”和画报先后表扬了他。去年秋季运动大会，他获得了师的奖状。团、师召开工学代表会，他连续被选为代表。练兵结束时，他被评为两小功，被推选为练兵模范。由于他觉悟的提高，文化学习上的努力，认识了共产党就是自己的救命恩人，他自动写了入党请求书。支部详细讨论了他的历史和解放后的表现，已同意他入党，并转报上级党委审查。陈世彬正愉快紧张的向前迈进着。
