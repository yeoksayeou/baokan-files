　　Careful Calculation Transforms Deficiency into Surplus
　　Yuci Special District Organizes Education Funding
　　Shanxi Provincial Department of Education Notifies All Special Counties to Learn From It
　　[Our newspaper's dispatch] The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Education Department recently issued a circular to all special districts, counties, cities, and industrial and mining areas, introducing the experience of the Yuci Special District in organizing local education funding. Before the Yuci Special District organized education funding, most counties reported that local education funding was not enough to cover expenses: Yangquan, Pingle, Yuci, and Yuci counties each owed between 500,000 and 370,000 jin of millet; Shouyang County was in arrears of several months' salary for primary school teachers; Lingshi, Jiexiu, and Pingyao also claimed to be short. On the other hand, there were also phenomena of waste and unreasonableness in the expenditure of education funds in various counties: for example, Yushi County transferred a part of the education funds to the construction costs of the Public Security Bureau; some schools in Yuci used public miscellaneous expenses to subsidize teachers' and students' stove coal expenses; and the Beiguan Complete Primary School in that county also had incidents of falsely reporting vacant positions, eating and drinking extravagantly, and collective corruption. In addition, some counties, where education funding was already insufficient to cover expenses, still demanded to expand schools or increase teachers' salaries. In order to organize education funding, the special district convened a meeting of audit section members of the education departments of various counties in January. At the meeting, everyone reviewed the reasons for the previous phenomenon of insufficient education funding, which was that the counties in the past did not "bottom out" education funding. The finance departments did not know the needs of education; the education departments did not understand the funding situation. As a result, they did not conspire with each other and shirk responsibility, forming a phenomenon of "bargaining." And the lower and upper levels also divided education funding into "you" and "me," thinking that "anyway, you will approve and reduce it, so I will over-report in advance," so that education funding could not be used in a planned and appropriate manner. In response to the above situation, the person in charge of the special office education section made a detailed report on the issue of mastering education funding at the meeting. It was clearly pointed out that we should recognize the difficulties in the current victory, oppose departmentalism, and oppose all phenomena of random spending and lack of thrift. The report pointed out that all counties should, according to the situation of education funding and in combination with work needs, ensure that each expenditure plays a high degree of effectiveness, and especially implement the spirit of living within one's means.
　　Next, the cadres attending the meeting studied the "Shanxi Interim Measures for the Expenditure of Local Education Funds." They clearly recognized the spirit of the new regulations for the expenditure of education funds this year (unified control by the education department, unified custody and reimbursement by the finance department), and decided to correct the shortcomings of the past education departments and finance departments not conspiring with each other. Then, according to the "Shanxi Interim Measures for the Expenditure of Local Education Funds," combined with the funding situation and actual needs of various places, the expenditure standards were studied and determined. Each county compiled a budget according to this standard, which was collectively reviewed by the cadres attending the meeting in groups, and finally approved by the special office. After such careful calculation, the education funds of the counties have basically been sufficient to cover expenses, and Yuci, Pingyao, Taigu, Pingding and other counties have a surplus of more than 400,000 to more than 40,000 jin of millet. In addition, the meeting also determined the audit accounting system, the issuance and reimbursement system, and the budget and final account system; unified regulations were also made on the recording of account books and payment procedures. At the same time, a strict inspection system was established to prevent waste and the occurrence of malpractices.

　　精打细算化不足为有余
    榆次专区整理教育经费     
    山西省教育厅通报各专县学习
    【本报讯】山西省人民政府教育厅近向各专、县、市和工矿区发出通报，介绍榆次专区整理地方教育经费的经验。榆次专区在整理教育经费之前，大多数县份反映地方教育经费不够开支：阳泉、平定、盂县、榆次等县各亏欠小米五十万斤至三十七万斤不等；寿阳县拖欠小学教员几个月的薪金；灵石、介休、平遥亦称短绌。另一方面，各县教育经费的开支又存在着浪费与不合理现象：如榆社县将一部分教育经费移用于公安局的修建费；榆次有的学校以公杂费来补助教员和学生的炉炭费；该县北关完小并发生过浮报空额、大吃大喝、集体贪污事件。此外，有些县份，教育经费本已不够开支，却还要求扩展学校或提高教员待遇。为整理教育经费，该专区于一月份召开了各县教育科审计科员会议。会上，大家检讨了过去教育经费不足现象的原因，是各县以往对教育经费“不蹬底”。财政部门不知道教育方面的需要；教育部门不明了经费情况。以致各不相谋，彼此扯皮，形成“讨价还价”的现象。而下级与上级，对教育经费也有“你”“我”之分，认为“反正你要批核减少的，我就预先多报一点”，致使教育经费不能有计划地恰当地运用。针对上述情况，专署教育科负责人在会上对掌握教育经费问题作了详细报告。明确指出：我们应认识当前胜利中的困难，反对本位观点，反对一切乱开支、不节约的现象。报告指出：各县应根据教育经费情况，结合工作需要，保证每项开支都发挥高度效用，尤其要贯彻量入为出的精神。
    接着，到会干部学习了《山西地方教育经费开支暂行办法》。明确认识了今年教育经费开支新规定的精神（由教育部门统一掌握，财政部门统一保管与报销），并决依此纠正过去教育部门与财政部门各不相谋的缺点。然后，根据《山西地方教育经费开支暂行办法》，结合各地经费情况与实际需要，研究并确定了开支标准。各县按此标准编造了预算，由到会干部分组进行集体审查，最后，由专署批准。经过这样精打细算之后，各县教育经费基本上已够开支，榆次、平遥、太谷、平定等县还长余小米四十余万斤到四万余斤不等。此外，会议并确定了审计会计制度、领发报销制度和预决算制度；对账簿记载和支付手续等也作了统一规定。同时，建立了严密的检查制度，以防止浪费和弊窦的发生。
