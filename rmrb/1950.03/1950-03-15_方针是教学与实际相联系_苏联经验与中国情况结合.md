　　According to the regulations of the Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Education, the teaching principle of the China People's University is to link teaching with practice and combine Soviet experience with China's situation. The courses of each department and class have concise and essential content, meeting practical needs. The teaching objective is very clear: to enable all students to understand the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and to be familiar with the necessary specialized business knowledge of the subject. The common compulsory courses for the first phase of undergraduate departments are Marxism-Leninism, On New Democracy, History of the Chinese Revolution, Russian, and Physical Education. In addition, the Department of Factory Management specializes in Political Economy and Factory Management; the Departments of Law and Diplomacy specialize in the Foundations of State and Law; and the Departments of Economics, Economic Planning, Fiscal Credit Lending, Trade, and Cooperatives specialize in Economic Geography and the Foundations of Higher Mathematics. Each specialized training class studies six to ten courses. All departments and classes emphasize practice, with more time spent on practice than on class. All students in each department will also go to relevant business agencies and factories for internships during winter and summer vacations. The teaching materials mainly adopt the latest textbooks from Soviet universities and specialized schools, as well as lecture notes and designated reference materials written by Soviet professors. The university has a dedicated translation and compilation office, publishing house, and printing factory.
    In order to better and more directly accept the advanced educational construction experience of the Soviet Union, the university has hired Soviet professors to teach various courses. Chinese professors include Ai Siqi, He Sijing, He Ganzi, Wang Kefeng, Hu Hua, Wang Dagang, etc. There are approximately 130 professors and teachers in the entire university.
    The university implements a president responsibility system. The school affairs committee is composed of the president, vice president, directors of research offices, secretary of the Party committee, heads of each department, and heads of each department (including teaching affairs and administrative departments) to jointly formulate the university's teaching plan and conduct planned teaching. The university also has a dedicated research department responsible for uniformly preparing teaching equipment for each department and researching and improving teaching. In addition, there are specialized course research offices (currently including Marxism-Leninism, Chinese Revolution Issues, Education, Finance and Economics, Law, Diplomacy, etc.) that actually organize teaching and organize Chinese and Soviet teachers to regularly investigate the actual work of relevant business departments, collect materials to enrich teaching materials, and invite relevant departments to participate in guiding work.
