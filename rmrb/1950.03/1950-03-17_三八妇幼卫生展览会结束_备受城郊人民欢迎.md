　　March 8th Mother and Child Health Exhibition Concludes; Well-Received by People in Urban and Suburban Areas

　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The March 8th Mother and Child Health Exhibition jointly organized by the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation and the Municipal Public Health Bureau (at Zhongshan Park) and the mobile exhibition in the suburban districts of the city, concluded entirely on the 15th. Over the past seven days, more than 23,000 people visited. At the venue, doctors, midwives, and nurses from the Municipal Public Health Bureau, National First Midwifery School, Peking Union Medical College, First Health Office, Municipal First Midwifery School, and the experimental zone for maternal and child health patiently explained things to the public, enabling them to gain much scientific knowledge. Many people from the suburbs brought their children from more than a dozen miles away to visit. After seeing the health exhibition, a woman from outside Guang'anmen said, "No wonder the child is always sick, it turns out it's because we don't pay attention to hygiene, we must pay attention to it in the future." Han Liying, a woman from outside Chaoyangmen, said: "The new method of delivery is really good, both the adult and the child don't suffer, I must go back and promote it to our neighbors."
