　　Grain Companies and Retail Stores
    Lantern Festival Open as Usual
    [This newspaper dispatch] It is customary for the Beijing Grain Exchange to be closed for one day on the third day of the month (the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar). The grain company will continue to sell grain as usual at the Xian Nong Tan and Chaoyangmen grain depots; all retail stores under the Retail Company will also be open as usual to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to raise prices.

　　粮食公司及零售店
    灯节照常营业
    【本报讯】京粮食交易所三日（夏历上元节）循例休市一日。粮食公司照常在先农坛、朝阳门两粮栈照常售粮；零售公司所属各零售店也照常营业，以防奸商借机抬价。
