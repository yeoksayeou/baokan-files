Kailuan Linxi and Other Coal Mines Neglect Safety Issues, Resulting in Consecutive Accidents

[This Dispatch] According to the Workers' Daily: At the Kailuan Linxi and other coal mines, due to a lack of attention to safety issues, worker deaths and injuries have occurred consecutively from the 22nd of last month to the 10th of this month (a period of 20 days). This should attract the attention of all parties.

(1) In the No. 9 slot, 564 stope face in the eastern section of the fifth working level underground at the Kailuan Linxi mine, the coal seam did not meet safety requirements, resulting in an accident that crushed and killed one worker. Ordinary coal seams should have three upward openings, or at least two. However, this seam only had one upward opening, and in order to produce more coal, workers were allowed to mine under the opening without any support. On January 22nd, at 11:00 AM, worker Zheng Rui from the 6:00 AM shift, under pressure from the team leader to produce more coal, went to mine at the unsupported area where the upward opening met the gateroad, and was crushed to death by a large piece of falling gangue. Prior to the incident, coal technician Zhu Zhendong had advised the second work section to add supports, but the second work section dismissed the concerns. Supervisor Wang Qingxiang also failed to conduct an inspection. After the accident, the supervisor and the second work section even attempted to conceal the truth of the incident by falsely reporting that Zheng Rui had been crushed to death while trying to eat dry noodles there. (2) At the Kailuan Tangshan mine, the coal cars filled with coal under the overpass above ground were not hauled away by locomotives. Instead, they were allowed to roll down the slope automatically and were then hauled away by locomotives after being weighed. However, the slope of the railway was very steep. When releasing the car, someone had to straddle the small ladder on the side of the car, hold the brake with their right hand, and grasp the iron ladder with their left hand to control it, which was extremely dangerous. In March 1948, weigher Li Dong was crushed to death after failing to control the brake for a moment. Workers requested that the mine switch to using locomotives for hauling, but the mine ignored their request. On February 10th, at 12:20 PM, weigher Wang Qingpei also fell off at a point 40 meters from the overpass in the same way and suffered severe injuries to his right arm and right leg, succumbing to his injuries in the evening. (3) At the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang mine, at 6:00 PM on the 24th of last month, the 874 mid-section in the eastern section of the third working level underground suddenly flooded with water. The water was very powerful. Fortunately, experienced veteran worker Chen Zuoxin risked his life to rescue the workers. More than 30 workers at that face and two repair workers at the eleventh gateroad behind the main working level were able to escape. Only odd-job worker Song Zhankui was knocked down and injured. That mid-section was only three feet of coal seam away from an old tunnel of the Linxi Mine. There was accumulated water in the old tunnel. The mine did not inspect it regularly, causing the coal seam to be breached by water, resulting in a dangerous accident.

### 开滦林西等煤矿忽视安全问题  连续发生事故

　　开滦林西等煤矿忽视安全问题  连续发生事故
    【本报讯】据工人日报讯：开滦林西等煤矿，由于不注意安全问题，自上月二十二日至本月十日的二十天内，连续发生死伤工人事情，应引起各方重视。
    （一）开滦林西矿井下五道行东头九槽五六四号回采煤洞，不合安全要求，发生事故，砸死工人一名。普通煤洞都应刨三个上山眼，至少也得刨两个，该洞却只有一个上山眼，并为多出煤，任令工人在无棚子的眼下刷煤。一月二十二日上午十一时，六点班工人郑瑞，因工头催煤催的紧，就往上山眼到顺槽交界没有棚子的地方去刨，被掉下来的一块大矸子砸死。事前，煤师朱振东虽向二工段保进行劝告，但二工却说不要紧，监工王庆祥也没有检查。事情发生后，监工、二工还企图蒙蔽事件真象，假报郑瑞是为吃干粉被压死在那里。（二）开滦唐山矿在井上天桥下接煤的车，装满后不用机车拖走，是利用坡度，使车自动溜下，过磅后才用机车拖走。但铁道坡度很大，放车时定要有人跨在车帮的小梯子上，右手掌握车闸，左手攀住铁梯，才能控制，极为危险。一九四八年三月，磅房工人李东，曾因一时未能控制车闸，跌下轧死，工人要求矿方改用机车拖，矿方未加理睬。二月十日十二时二十分，磅房工人王庆佩也这样在离天桥四十米处跌下，被轧重伤右臂右腿，入晚不治而死。（三）开滦唐家庄矿，上月二十四日下午六点，井下三道行东八七四中行，突然透水，水势很猛，幸亏有经验的老工人陈作新冒险抢救，该掌子三十多个工人和大行后十一道顺槽的二个修理工人才得脱险，仅杂工宋占魁一人被冲倒受伤。该中行离林西矿一洞子，只有三尺厚的煤皮，老洞里有积水，平时矿方未加检查，以致煤皮被水突破，发生危险事故。
