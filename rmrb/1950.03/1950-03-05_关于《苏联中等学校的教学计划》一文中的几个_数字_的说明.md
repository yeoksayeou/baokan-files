Regarding the Explanation of Several "Numbers" in the Article "Teaching Plan of Soviet Secondary Schools"

　　The article "Teaching Plan of Soviet Secondary Schools" published on the third page of this newspaper on January 25th contained some "numbers" that some readers did not understand. The following explanation is provided:

　　Soviet secondary schools refer to ten-year schools established for children aged seven to sixteen. The "total study time of 9,547 hours per year" mentioned in the article refers to the total class time of all courses in the ten grades of secondary school. Accordingly, the following statement "the total study time for Russian, foreign languages, and literature courses is 3,791 hours" refers to the total class time for Russian, foreign languages, and literature courses in all ten grades of the school. Similarly, the article states that natural science courses are arranged to begin in the fourth grade, with a class time of 458 hours per year, which refers to the total class time for all natural science courses from the fourth to tenth grades of the school. Because this is a teaching plan drafted by the school, the so-called total study time is the total time required by the school to arrange classes for all courses in the ten grades throughout the year. At the same time, this is equivalent to the total class time for a Soviet student from the first to tenth grades. According to an average of 213 study days per year, we can understand that the average weekly class time for Soviet secondary school students is 27 hours, and the average daily class time is four and a half hours.

　　If readers want to further understand the relevant issues of the Soviet ten-year secondary school system, please refer to the article "The National Education System of the Soviet Union" published on the fifth page of this newspaper on November 14, 1949.

### 关于《苏联中等学校的教学计划》一文中的几个“数字”的说明

　　关于《苏联中等学校的教学计划》一文中的几个“数字”的说明
    一月二十五日本报第三版发表的《苏联中等学校的教学计划》一文，其中有些“数字”，若干读者看不明白，今特说明如下：
    苏联的中等学校是指为七——十六岁儿童而设立的十年制学校，文中所说“每年的全部学习时间是九千五百四十七小时”是指中等学校十个年级所有课程上课的总时间；据此，以下所说“俄语、外文和文学课等的学习时间算在一起共为三千七百九十一小时”，是指全校十个年级的俄语、外文及文学课所上课的总时间；同样的，文中所说教学计划中安排的自然常识是从四年级开始学习，每年上课的时间是四百五十八小时，即是指校中自四年级至十年级所有自然课上课的总时间。因为这是学校方面拟定的教学计划，因此所谓学习总时间是学校方面来安排的一年中十个年级所有课程上课所需的总时间。同时，这也就相等于一个苏联学生从一年级至十年级所有上课的时间。根据每年全部学习日平均为二百一十三日计，我们可以了解苏联中学生每周上课的时间平均为二十七小时，每天上课的时间平均为四个半小时。
    如果读者想进一步了解苏联十年制中等学校的有关问题，请参看一九四九年十一月十四日本报第五版所载《苏联的国民教育制度》一文。
