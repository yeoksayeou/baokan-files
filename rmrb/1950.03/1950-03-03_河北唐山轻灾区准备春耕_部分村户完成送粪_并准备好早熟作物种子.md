Hebei Tangshan Light Disaster Area Prepares for Spring Ploughing
    Some Villages Complete Manure Delivery and Prepare Early-Maturing Crop Seeds

    [Reported by this newspaper from the Tangshan Special District] The vast light disaster areas of Tangshan Special District, Hebei, have launched an upsurge in spring ploughing preparations. The slogan "Take advantage of the frozen ground to quickly deliver manure, saving labor and effort" has become a practical action for the masses. In the second, fifth, and sixth districts of Linyu County, after mobilization, 115 villages with 1,927 people are busy delivering manure to the fields. In Qian'an, 480 villages have begun delivering manure. Village cadre Zeng Guangqin (village party secretary) of Dongyuanzhai Village in the fifth district launched a mutual challenge at a village party member meeting, guaranteeing that the manure would be delivered within ten days, working early and late, to lead the masses. Jiakou Village in the fourth district lacked animal power; under the leadership of party members, 70 people carried manure every day. In the manure delivery process, Liugudao Village enthusiastically helped eight military families complete their manure delivery. In Leting, fifteen villages in the fifth district have delivered manure to more than 3,000 mu of low-lying land. In Lulong County, the masses of 348 villages have generally started to drive donkeys to deliver manure. In the fourth district, among the 5,289 households in 40 administrative villages, 3,705 households were busy delivering manure before the end of January, of which 2,671 households had already completed the delivery.

    In order to shorten the period of disaster, farmers in some counties are actively preparing seeds of early-maturing crops such as spring wheat, peas, early-harvest vegetables, and corn. In the former and latter Hei Wangzhuang, Bei Changtuo, Songgezhuang, He Guanying, Le Liuhe, and other villages in Leting’s eighth district, which were severely affected by floods, 6,300 jin of spring wheat seeds have been prepared. He Guanying has a total of 94 households with 1,161 mu of land. 670 mu of autumn wheat have been planted, and the whole village is preparing to sow 400 mu of spring wheat in order to shorten the period of disaster. Currently, 40 households have prepared 1,250 jin of wheat seeds. In Qian’an’s first district, among the 930 households in Shanzhai and other nine villages, 726 households have prepared 1,960 jin of early corn seeds, 453 jin of various early-maturing vegetable seeds, and 492 jin of pea seeds. In the fourth district, 74 villages have 6,970 households preparing seeds for early-maturing crops. With the help of the government, 36 wells have been dug, and the entire district has mobilized 330 carpenters to manufacture waterwheels, and 29 waterwheels have already been produced.

    Based on the above situation, the Production Committee of the Special District put forward the following suggestions on the current spring ploughing production preparation work: (1) Leaders at all county and district levels in the light disaster areas should immediately mobilize the masses to carry out comprehensive spring ploughing preparation to avoid delaying the farming season; (2) Leaders in all areas should universally pay attention to checking and mobilizing the masses to select superior varieties to increase production; (3) It is necessary to check the coarsely tilled land from last autumn and mobilize the masses to re-till it once to facilitate spring ploughing and sowing.

　　河北唐山轻灾区准备春耕
    部分村户完成送粪  并准备好早熟作物种子
    【本报唐山专区讯】河北唐山专区广大轻灾区，已展开春耕准备热潮。“趁冻快送粪、省工又省劲”的口号，已变成了群众的实际行动。在临榆县二、五、六，三个区内，经发动已有一百十五个村，一千九百二十七人忙着往地里送粪。迁安已有四百八十个村庄开始送粪，五区东辕寨村村干部曾广勤（村支书）在全村党员会上，发动了互相挑战，保证十天内起早贪黑带动群众把粪全部送完。四区夹口村缺乏畜力在党员带动下，每天有七十人挑着送粪。六股道村在送粪中，并热情帮助八户军属把粪送完。乐亭五区十五个村已把三千多亩洼地的粪送齐。卢龙县三百四十八个村群众已普遍动手赶驴送粪。四区四十个行政村五千二百八十九户中，在一月底以前已有三千七百零五户忙着送粪，其中二千六百七十一户已经送完。
    为了缩短灾荒，目前有的县份农民已积极准备春麦、豌豆，早收蔬菜，玉黍等早熟作物种籽。乐亭八区水灾严重的前后黑王庄、北常坨、松各庄、河官营、勒柳河等村，已备好春麦种六千三百斤。河官营共九十四户，共土地一千一百六十一亩，已种秋麦六百七十亩，全村为了缩短灾荒准备播种春麦四百亩，现已有四十户备好麦种一千二百五十斤。迁安一区山寨等九村，在九百三十户中，已有七百二十六户准备好早玉黍种籽一千九百六十斤，各种早熟菜籽四百五十三斤，豌豆种四百九十二斤。四区七十四个村已有六千九百七十户准备好早熟作物种籽。在政府帮助下已打好三十六眼井，全区并发动了三百三十个木匠制造水车，现已制出水车二十九架。
    根据上述情况，该专区生产委员特对当前春耕生产准备工作提出几点意见：（一）轻灾区各县区领导上要立即发动群众全面进行春耕准备，以免误了耕时；（二）各地领导上应普遍注意检查和动员群众选择优良品种，以利增产；（三）要检查去秋垡地粗糙的地，发动群众再重垡一遍，以利春耕播种。
