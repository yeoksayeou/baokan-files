　　【Our Newspaper News】A certain division of the North China Military Region has mobilized commanders and fighters to write diaries. In a certain regiment of this division, everyone has subscribed to a diary, and 70 percent of the people insist on writing every day. In order to consolidate the achievements of previous cultural studies during this spring's decentralized production, the Party Committee of the division called on commanders and fighters to universally write diaries. A certain regiment was the first to respond to this call. When they first started writing diaries, many people, especially those with little literacy, were not interested; some also felt that writing diaries would delay the time for cultural learning. The leaders of the regiment immediately explained that writing diaries and learning culture are consistent. Attending class is like eating, writing a diary can help with digestion, improve writing ability, and strengthen ideological awareness. At the same time, different requirements for writing diaries were put forward according to the cultural level of the commanders and fighters. Those with a higher level of education were asked to write more about their learning gains, ideological situations, and feelings, and to pay attention to grammar and punctuation to prevent the tendency of "keeping a running account." Comrades studying in literacy classes were asked to write literacy diaries or simply write a few sentences, focusing on expanding literacy achievements and reviewing the words they have learned. In addition, leading cadres of the regiment and battalion were required to take the lead in writing first. In this way, everyone has to write for twenty or thirty minutes every night. The comrade who writes the best diary in the literacy class has expanded his recognition of more than 200 new words in a week. Everyone reacted: words that they did not know how to use or were not familiar with in the past have been learned to be used in writing diaries. The regiment has also established a diary inspection system. Mutual aid groups check each other every day, and cultural teachers regularly check and correct them to correct misspellings and clichés. The Third Battalion also read good diaries to everyone; the Seventh Company set up a "Diary Garden" to exhibit well-written diaries, and stipulated that those who are selected for the exhibition three times in a row will be rewarded.

　　华北军区某师发动指战员写日记  帮助部队提高文化
    【本报讯】华北军区某师，发动指战员写日记。该师某团人人订了日记本，并有百分之七十的人坚持天天写。该师为了今春在分散生产中能巩固以前文化学习的成绩，中共师党委号召指战员普遍写日记。某团首先响应这一号召。开始写日记时，有很多人尤其是识字少的人，没有兴趣；也有人认为写日记会耽误文化学习的时间。该团领导上即说明写日记和学文化是一致的。上课好比吃饭，写日记能帮助消化，能提高写作能力和加强思想意识的修养。同时，又根据指战员的文化程度，提出写日记的不同要求。对文化程度较高的同志，要求多写学习收获、思想情况和感想等，并注意文法和标点符号，防止“记流水账”的偏向。对在识字班学习的同志，要求写识字日记或只简单地记几句话，以扩大识字成绩和复习学过的字为主。此外，并要求团、营的领导干部带头先写。这样，每天晚上大家都要写二、三十分钟。识字班中写日记最好的同志，一星期中已扩大认识了二百多个生字。大家反应：过去不会用和不熟习的字，在写日记中学会运用了。该团并建立了检查日记制度。互助小组里每天互相检查，文化教员定期检查批改，以纠正错别字和陈词滥调。三营更把好的日记念给大家听；七连设立了“日记园地”，展览写得好的日记，并规定连续三次当选展览的给予奖励。
