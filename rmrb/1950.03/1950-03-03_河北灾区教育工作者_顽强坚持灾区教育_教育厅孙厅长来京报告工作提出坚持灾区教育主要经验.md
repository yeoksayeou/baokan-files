Hebei Disaster Area Educational Workers Tenaciously Persist in Education
Director Sun of the Education Department Reports Work in Beijing, Proposing Key Experiences in Upholding Education in Disaster Areas

[This newspaper reports] Educational workers in the disaster areas of Hebei Province, under the correct leadership of the Education Department, have tenaciously fought against the disaster and persisted in educational work in the disaster areas for the past six months. Sun Wenshu, Director of the Provincial Education Department, reported to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government in Beijing on the 22nd of last month regarding the educational work in the disaster areas, saying: One-fourth of Hebei Province was flooded last year. Alongside the more than seven million disaster victims who were intensively engaged in production for self-relief, the vast number of educational workers demonstrated the noble qualities of the people's teachers in upholding education in the disaster areas, and created many valuable experiences.

Director Sun put forward the following key experiences in upholding education work in disaster areas over the past six months:

I. The most important issue for the masses in disaster areas is the issue of survival. Therefore, education work in disaster areas must serve production and disaster relief in order to gain the support of the masses and persist. Most of the floods in Hebei occurred in newly liberated areas, and the masses had no experience in production for self-relief. Initially, some cadres and the masses were ideologically confused, believing that the disaster could not be salvaged. In this situation, educational workers in the disaster areas implemented the policy of education serving production for self-relief, and cooperated with village cadres to conduct propaganda and education to the masses through winter schools, radio broadcasts, and blackboards, strengthening their confidence in production for self-relief. For example, some teachers, addressing the erroneous idea of ​​"simply relying on government relief," compiled teaching materials entitled "Relying on Relief is Undesirable" for explanation in winter schools. Some teachers compiled methods of production for self-relief into "rhymes," using students to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for production for self-relief. The result of doing so in Zhao Zheng Temple, a severely affected village in the fifth district of Wuji County, was that 136 out of 178 households in the entire village engaged in sideline production such as textiles, oil mills, and flour mills. Disaster area schools received the support of the masses because they helped them solve their livelihood problems.

　　　　　　　　Learning Must Be Closely Integrated with Production and Disaster Relief; Courses and Teaching Methods Should Be Modified Appropriately

II. Learning must be closely integrated with production and disaster relief. In the process of upholding education in disaster areas, we deeply realized that educational workers must not only be good at organizing students to learn, but also be good at organizing students to produce, so that students can effectively help their families overcome the disaster. Only in this way can parents be happy to send their children to school and persist in learning, lay a reliable mass foundation for upholding education in disaster areas, and reduce the number of children dropping out of school. During the severe disaster in Qian Miaozhuangzi Village, Huanghua County, the number of students decreased significantly, and parents responded: "School is only possible in good years! Going to school now doesn't fill you up, it's better to beg for food and not starve to death." Later, the teachers organized students to produce during the day and attend classes in the early morning and evening. Girls spun one catty of cotton every three days, earning seven catties of rice a week; boys swept saltpeter soil every day, which could be exchanged for one catty of rice. In this way, the students' living problems were partially solved, the masses were very supportive, and all 52 students in the village enrolled. Six schools, including Liuhe and Daxingkou in Qinghe County, organized students to collect firewood, sweep saltpeter soil, and leach saltpeter, increasing the number of students from 175 to 374. All of this proves that the combination of learning and production is an effective method for upholding education in disaster areas.

In order to closely integrate learning with production, it is necessary to make necessary changes to class times, courses, and teaching methods. Some areas have adopted half-day classes, early schools, noon schools, night schools, two-end schooling (early morning and evening schooling), and mobile teaching methods according to the production needs of the masses; some have changed market days to Sundays to facilitate students helping their parents go to market and do business. Courses are appropriately reduced, concentrating efforts on teaching the main courses—Chinese language and arithmetic. Teaching methods vary, with some teaching as students arrive, and others tutoring children who have returned from begging for food. All of these methods are deeply appreciated by the masses.

III. Teachers and students share weal and woe with the masses. At the beginning of the disaster, the Hebei Education Department issued instructions proposing that primary school teachers in disaster areas should share weal and woe with the masses and practice strict economy. Under this call, teachers in various places have displayed a high degree of hard work and dedication, demonstrated the noble qualities of the people's teachers, and created many heroic and exemplary deeds. Teachers in many areas waded through water to conduct mobile teaching in nearby villages. Some worked with the masses to build bridges and embankments. Teachers and students of Qiuxian Elementary School jointly guarded the embankments in the evenings after finishing classes during the day and helped the masses transport flood control equipment. Some teachers became ill from overwork, but still went to class with the support of their students. Many teachers in the severely affected areas of Jingxian County only ate one meal a day. The masses were so moved that they voluntarily donated yams and bran vegetables to maintain the teachers' lives. In a primary school formed after the merger of four villages, including Zhangqizhuang in the first district, teacher Wang Zhaohua persisted in working despite hunger, teaching 95 students alone, and achieved good results. They wrote on the wall: "Tighten our belts, keep our eyes peeled, and persist in education in the disaster areas." This slogan, full of confidence, encouraged the teachers and also encouraged the primary school students who were eating bran and vegetables and begging for school.

In disaster areas, school operating expenses have mostly been reduced by one-half. Therefore, schools cannot read newspapers, cannot light fires in winter, and cannot even afford to paste windows. In order to overcome financial difficulties, teachers in disaster-stricken counties have voluntarily reduced their salaries to the standard of maintaining a minimum livelihood. Some teachers have not received grain for three or four months, but still persist in working. In the severely affected areas of Tianjin and Tangshan, most of the teachers are provided with food, eating what the masses eat, and starving when the masses starve. However, their work spirit remains tenacious. Some teachers put forward the slogan of "promoting the spirit of hard work during the Anti-Japanese War and upholding the people's education cause," enduring hunger and suffering to stick to their posts. Many models of hard work and study have also emerged among the students. Students in severely affected areas mostly beg for food while attending school. Some students, carrying their schoolbags, formed groups to beg for food in non-disaster areas, and studied when they were full. Zhang Xihong, a student from Xuzhuang in Jingxian County, begged for food with his mother in non-disaster areas and brought back the cool yams he had begged for to persist in learning.

　　　　　　　　Transfer Teachers to Schools for Study; Make Every Effort to Preserve the Teaching Staff

IV. Make every effort to preserve the teaching staff. In the face of severe disaster and financial difficulties, some schools have had to temporarily close or merge. According to known materials, one district in Gaoyang merged four primary schools and closed eleven. In Fudong, a total of 183 primary schools were closed or merged in various districts. As the number of schools decreased, the number of employed teachers also decreased simultaneously. According to statistics from Tianjin Prefecture in November last year, the number of teachers had decreased by 1,014 compared to before the disaster. However, the disaster is temporary after all. If this group of teachers who have to temporarily leave their educational posts are not preserved and allowed to change careers on their own, it will add great difficulties to future education work. Therefore, in education work in disaster areas, preserving the teaching staff is an extremely important issue. In preserving and resettling the teaching staff, Hebei generally adopted the following methods: (1) Sending them to normal schools to study. For example, Jingxian Normal School specially set up higher normal classes and cultural classes for this purpose, preserving 120 teachers; (2) Introducing them to work in non-disaster areas. For example, after Anxin was hit by the disaster, 150 teachers were introduced to Boye and Li County; (3) Transferring teachers back to work in their own villages and joining families, which can save firewood and food; in addition, they can take care of family life; (4) Due to various limitations (such as only solving the teacher's own living problems, while the family still has no solution, and the teacher needs to participate in labor, etc.), those who have to temporarily change careers are issued suspension-pending certificates to maintain contact and prepare to have them reinstated at any time.

Director Sun Wenshu said in his report: Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned methods, primary school education in some lightly affected areas of Hebei has gradually recovered, but the overall education situation is still under the severe devastation of the disaster. Solving financial difficulties and preserving the teaching staff are the two major important issues in the current education work in disaster areas. Based on this, Director Sun proposed that the following two points should be noted in the future:

I. Each county should conduct research based on the severity of the disaster, the existing funds, and the experience of upholding education in disaster areas. For schools that can persist, efforts should be made to persist to the end. If there are really no conditions to persist, they should be temporarily merged or closed on their own initiative. Education funds should be appropriately adjusted to maintain the minimum needs of schools. Non-disaster areas should expand savings and donate to schools in disaster areas to support education in disaster areas.

II. Under possible conditions, each county may appropriately increase the number of teacher rotation training classes, and maintain frequent contact with teachers who have been forced to change careers, preparing to have them reinstated at any time. Disasters are temporary, education is long-term, and each county should use various methods to preserve and resettle teachers as much as possible.

　　河北灾区教育工作者  顽强坚持灾区教育
    教育厅孙厅长来京报告工作提出坚持灾区教育主要经验
    【本报讯】河北省灾区教育工作者，半年来在教育厅的正确领导下，顽强地和灾荒进行斗争，坚持了灾区教育工作。该省教育厅厅长孙文淑上月二十二日来京向中央人民政府教育部汇报灾区教育工作情况时说：河北全省去年有四分之一的土地被淹。和紧张进行生产自救的七百余万灾民一起，广大的教育工作者在坚持灾区教育工作中表现了人民教师的高贵品质，并创造了不少经验。
    孙厅长提出半年来坚持灾区教育工作的主要经验如下：
    一、灾区群众的头等重要问题，是生死问题。因此，灾区的教育工作必须为生产救灾服务，才能得到群众拥护，坚持下去。河北的水灾多半发生在新解放地区，群众无生产自救经验。最初，曾有部分干部、群众思想混乱，认为灾荒无法挽救。在这种情况下，灾区教育工作者执行了教育为生产自救服务的方针，配合村干部，通过冬学、广播、黑板报等向群众进行宣传教育，坚定了他们生产自救的信心。如有的教员针对大家“单纯依赖政府救济”的错误思想，编了“依赖救济不应该”的教材在冬学讲解。有的教员把生产自救的办法编成“顺口溜”，通过学生以鼓动群众生产自救的情绪。无极县五区重灾村赵正寺这样做的结果，全村一七八户中有一三六户搞起了纺织、油坊、粉坊等副业生产。灾区学校由于帮助群众解决了生活问题，受到了群众的拥护。
            学习要密切结合生产救灾  酌情更动课程与教学方法
    二、学习要密切结合生产救灾。我们在坚持灾区教育的工作中深深体验到，教育工作者不仅要善于组织学生学习，还必须善于组织学生生产，以便使学生有效地帮助家庭渡荒，这样，才能使家长乐于送子弟入学坚持学习；才能给坚持灾区教育打下可靠的群众基础，减少失学儿童。黄骅县前苗庄子村在灾情严重期间，学生减少很多，家长反应：“好年头上学才行呵！现在上学又上不饱，还不如要饭吃饿不死。”后经教员组织学生白天生产，早晚上课，女生三天纺一斤棉花，一星期可赚七斤米；男生扫硝土每天可换一斤米。这样，部分地解决了学生的生活问题，群众非常拥护，因而全村五十二个学生都入了学。青河县流河、大兴口等六个学校把学生组织起来拾柴、扫硝土、淋硝，使学生由一七五人增加到三七四人。这都证明学习与生产结合是坚持灾区教育的有效方法。
    为使学习与生产密切结合，必须将上课时间、课程、教学方法等加以必要的变动。有些地区根据群众生产需要采用半日班、早校、午校、夜校、两头上学（早晚上学）、巡回教学等办法；有的把集日改为星期日，便于学生帮助家长赶集做生意。课程则适当减少，集中力量讲主要课程——国文、算术。教法有的是随到随教，有的还为出去要饭回来的儿童补习功课。所有这些办法，都深得群众赞许。
    三、师生与群众同甘苦共患难。当灾荒到来之初，河北教育厅即曾发出指示，提出灾区小学教员要与群众同甘共苦，厉行节约。在这一号召下，各地教师发扬了高度的艰苦奋斗精神，表现了人民教师的高尚品质，创造了很多英雄模范事迹，不少地区的教师们趟着水到附近各村进行巡回教学。有的则和群众一块修桥、筑堤。邱县完小师生白天上完课，晚上共同看堤，并帮助群众搬运防水器材。有的教员因劳致疾，让学生扶着还去上课。景县重灾区不少教员都是一天吃一顿饭。群众感动得自动捐给山药、糠菜来维持教员生活。一区张奇庄等四个村合并后的一座小学，教员王兆华在饥饿中坚持工作，一人教九十五个学生，成绩很好。他们在墙上写着：“紧腰、瞪眼，坚持灾区教育。”这种充满信心的标语，鼓励着教师，也鼓励着吃糠咽菜、讨饭上学的小学生们。
    在灾区，学校办公费多半减少二分之一。因此学校不能看报纸，冬天不能生火，甚至连窗子都糊不起。为了克服经费困难，灾区各县教员自动降低待遇到维持最低生活的标准，有的教员三、四个月领不到粮食，仍然坚持工作。天津、唐山两专区的重灾区多半是给教员派饭吃，群众吃什么，教员吃什么，群众挨饿，他们也挨饿。但是他们的工作精神仍然是顽强的。有的教师提出“发扬抗战期间的艰苦奋斗作风，坚持人民教育事业”的口号，忍饥受苦地坚守自己的岗位。在学生中也出现了许多艰苦求学的模范。重灾区的学生多半是一面要饭，一面上学。有的学生背着书包，组成小组，到非灾区要饭，要饱了就进行学习。景县徐庄学生张希鸿跟母亲在非灾区要饭，把要的凉山药带回来坚持学习。
            抽调教员入校学习  多方设法保存师资
    四、多方面设法保存师资。在灾情严重、经费困难的情况下，有些学校不得不暂时停办或合并。据已知材料，高阳一个区便合并小学四处，停办十一处。阜东各区小学停办与合并者共一八三处。随着学校的减少，录用教员的数量也同时减少。据天津专区去年十一月统计，已较灾前减少教员一○一四人。但是，灾荒毕竟是暂时的，这一批不得不暂时离开教育工作岗位的教员，如不加以保存，而让其自流的转业，则会给将来的教育工作增加极大的困难。因此，在灾区教育工作中，保存师资是一个极其重要的问题。河北各地在保存与安置师资上，一般采取了如下的办法：（一）送他们到师范学校学习。如景县师范即为此特设了高师班和文化班，保存了师资一二○人；（二）介绍到非灾区工作，如安新受灾后介绍到博野、蠡县的教员有一五○人；（三）调教员回本村工作，和家庭一块起伙，可以节省柴粮；另外可以照顾家庭生活；（四）由于种种条件的限制（如只解决教员本人生活问题，而家庭仍然没有办法，需要教员本人参加劳动的等等）不得不暂时转业的则发给停职待用证，保持联系，准备使其随时复职。
    孙文淑厅长在报告中说道：由于采取了上述种种办法，目前河北某些轻灾区的小学教育已逐渐恢复，但整个教育情况还处在灾情的严重摧残下。解决经费困难和保存师资，是目前灾区教育工作中的两大重要问题。据此，孙厅长提出今后应注意以下两点：
    一、各县应根据灾情轻重、现有经费和坚持灾区教育的经验加以研究，对可能坚持的学校，要设法坚持到底，实在没有条件坚持的即主动地予以暂时合并或停办。教育经费要适当调剂，用以维持学校的最低需要。非灾区应展开节约，捐助灾区学校，以支持灾区教育工作。
    二、在可能条件下，各县可适当增加教师轮训班名额，对不得已而转业的教师要与之保持经常联系，准备使他们随时复职。灾荒是暂时的，教育是长期的，各县要用各种办法尽量保存和安置教员。
