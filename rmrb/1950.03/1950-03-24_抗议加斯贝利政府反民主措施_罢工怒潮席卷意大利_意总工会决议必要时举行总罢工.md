Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 23rd: A wave of protests against the Gasperi government's anti-democratic measures swept across Italy on the 20th and 21st, most fiercely in the northern industrial areas. On the 20th, residents of almost all towns in Milan, Genoa, Tuscany, Emilia, and southern Italy spontaneously held meetings, demonstrations, and strikes. In Milan and its suburbs, more than 100,000 workers went on strike and gathered in the city center and Cathedral Square. Traffic came to a standstill, and the police were fully mobilized but did not dare intervene. The secretary of the Milan Municipal Committee of the Italian Communist Party, Alberti, and the socialist Lombardi, speaking in Cathedral Square, said: "The workers of Milan will never compromise with fascist laws."

According to the L'Unità newspaper: An unprecedentedly large mass of workers, totaling 120,000, gathered in the central square of Genoa. Demonstrators burned reactionary and fascist newspapers in the streets.

More than 60,000 people participated in the Bologna rally. Rallies with tens of thousands of workers also took place in Parma, Modena, and other cities in Emilia. Similar rallies were also held in Siena and Florence.

The police took action against demonstrators in Terni (in Umbria). All the workers there went on strike in the morning. The masses resisted the motorized police who attacked them. The troops sent to deal with the demonstrators lined up to separate the people and the police, rescuing the people from the police. They also removed the bullets from their guns, pointing the muzzles upwards, followed by expressions of friendship between the troops and the people.

The trade union committees in the province of Rome, Siena, Pisa, and many cities in Tuscany, and many towns in the southern province of Catanzaro, called for a general strike on the 20th.

In Calabria, the working people of Crotone and thousands of farmers from the Nicastro district took to the streets on the 21st, organizing a moving protest demonstration in response to the Catanzaro provincial governor's order prohibiting gatherings.
