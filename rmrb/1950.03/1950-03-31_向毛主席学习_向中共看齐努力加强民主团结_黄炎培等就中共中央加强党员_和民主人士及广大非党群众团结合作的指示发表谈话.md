Xinhua News Agency, March 30th:

　　Following the issuance of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's instructions on March 25th regarding strengthening the unity and cooperation between Communist Party members, democratic personages, and the broad non-Party masses, Huang Yanpei, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Guo Moruo, non-Party democratic personage and CPPCC representative, Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, each issued statements.

  Huang Yanpei
    Huang Yanpei, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: "I was very moved after reading this instruction. Just imagine: CCP members are even learning from non-Party members, so shouldn't non-Party members learn from CCP members?! CCP members want to unite and cooperate with non-Party masses, so shouldn't non-Party masses emulate the CCP and learn from and unite and cooperate with each other? I think anyone who reads this instruction, whether a CCP member or not, as long as they are not 'seeking personal gain,' will undoubtedly be greatly moved. Not only moved, but also happy to express their acceptance through action. I believe CCP members will certainly be the first to sincerely accept it, because the CCP leaders not only issue such documents, but their actions are also full of this spirit—sincerity, humility, and amiability. This spirit will move anyone. I am willing to frankly say: I am one of those who has been moved."

    Guo Moruo
    Guo Moruo, non-Party democratic personage and CPPCC representative, said: "Regarding this instruction, I believe all Communist Party members are very encouraged and will strictly implement it. However, unity and cooperation are two-way matters. With the efforts of Communist Party members, the efforts of non-Communist Party members are also needed to cooperate, and only then can more satisfactory results be easily obtained. Therefore, I feel that the efforts on the part of non-Communist Party members should also be strengthened. On the part of non-Communist Party members, it is best to learn from the example of Communist Party members, to make oneself or one's organization submit to national discipline, to arm oneself with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, to adopt the same method of self-criticism, to adopt the same attitude of serving the people, and to wholeheartedly cherish the People's Liberation Army and promote the nation's policies. In these aspects, if non-Communist Party organizations or the masses can display a high degree of initiative, not only can the united front work achieve greater results with half the effort, but the construction of the entire country will also surely reach its established goals more quickly."

    Peng Zemin
    Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: "The CCP Central Committee's instruction issued on March 25th is not only of great educational significance to CCP members, but especially of greater educational significance to the personages of various democratic parties and the masses of non-CCP members. Unity is a two-way matter. The CCP is so tirelessly, humbly, and selflessly engaging in democratic cooperation with people outside the Party. What should we, as democratic party members, do? We must deeply reflect on ourselves and seriously examine whether we are 'stubbornly clinging to our own views' and 'self-righteous,' whether we have the determination to serve the people and the spirit of being responsible for national affairs, and whether we still retain selfish and self-interested thoughts. Only after these problems are completely eliminated can we 'manage national affairs well' and have the basic conditions for uniting with the CCP. Therefore, we should learn from the CCP, emulate the CCP, resolutely support Chairman Mao's call, and follow the points enlightened by Chairman Mao in this document, constantly conducting self-transformation and improvement in practice. Only in this way can we be good at carrying out democratic unity with the CCP. In particular, Chairman Mao instructed us, 'We are not afraid to speak out about our shortcomings, we must correct our shortcomings.' Yes, we should use such a brave, frank, and sincere spirit, under the leadership of the CCP, to besiege our shortcomings and carry out national democratic unity on the basis of progress."

    Ma Xulun
    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "Unity and cooperation are a fundamental condition for building a new China. The 'close and seamless' cooperation between the CCP and 'non-Party members' under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao proves that CCP members can implement the Central Committee's instructions. However, the CCP Central Committee also conducts self-examination, fearing that a few individual Party members may not be able to experience this importance, and issues another instruction. Such an attitude and style are truly worthy of 'admiration' and learning by 'non-Party members.' I believe that the vast majority of non-Party members will therefore 'respond to the call' and unite around the Chinese Communist Party to cooperate sincerely. However, unity and cooperation should be based on the same sincere feelings from both sides. Non-Party democratic personages should also strictly examine whether we have places where we are not sincere enough in uniting and cooperating with the CCP. Chairman Mao said: 'The Communist Party is a political party that seeks the interests of the nation and the people, and it has no selfish interests to seek.' Do we have any facts of seeking selfish interests? Do we have any intentions for selfish interests? We should also examine this ideologically. Only in this way can we unite sincerely and cooperate sincerely."

    Xu Deheng
    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said: "After reading the CCP Central Committee's instructions of March 25th, we feel that it is our unparalleled good fortune and the good fortune of the Chinese revolution to have the Chinese Communist Party, which is so broad-minded, frank, loyal, and constantly self-alert, leading us in carrying out China's revolutionary construction work! The Chinese Communist Party—a political party that fights for the survival of the nation and seeks the interests of the people—has already made this selfless call, calling for correcting shortcomings and strengthening unity. We people outside the Party should all the more emulate the CCP, learn from Chairman Mao, intensify our self-examination, correct our mistakes, unite around the Chinese Communist Party, eliminate the reactionaries, and 'manage national affairs well.'"

　　向毛主席学习·向中共看齐努力加强民主团结
    黄炎培等就中共中央加强党员
    和民主人士及广大非党群众团结合作的指示发表谈话
    【新华社三十日讯】中国共产党中央委员会本月二十五日发布加强共产党员和民主人士及广大非党群众团结合作的指示后，民主建国会常务委员黄炎培，无党派民主人士政协代表郭沫若，中国农工民主党中央监委会主席彭泽民，中国民主促进会主席马叙伦，九三学社主席许德珩，均分别发表谈话。
  黄炎培
    民主建国会常务委员黄炎培说：我读了这分指示，非常感动。试想：中共党员还要向非党员学习，非党员还不学习中共党员吗？！中共党员要和非党群众团结合作，非党群众还不向中共看齐，还不相互学习，相互团结合作吗？我想任何人读到这分指示，不论是中共党员，非中共党员，只须不是“图私利”的，怕没有一个不会大大地感动的，不但感动，而且乐于以行为来表示接受的。我相信中共党员一定首先诚实地接受，因为中共领袖们不单是发布这种文告，他们的行动，充满着这种精神——诚恳、虚心、和气，这种精神，任何人都要感动的，我愿坦白地说：我就是被感动的一个人。
    郭沫若
    无党派民主人士政协代表郭沫若说：对于这一次的指示，我相信全体共产党员都是非常振奋，一定会严格地执行的。但团结合作是双方面的事，有了共产党员的努力，还须有非共产党员的努力来配合，然后才比较容易地得到完满的效果。因此，我感觉着在非共产党员方面的努力也应该加强起来才好。在非共产党员方面，最好是学习共产党员的榜样，使自己或组织服从国家纪律，把马、恩、列、斯的理论来武装自己，同样采取自我批评的方法，同样采取为人民群众服务的态度，而且以全力来爱护人民解放军，推行国家的政策。在这些方面，如果非共产党的组织或群众能够发挥高度的积极性，不仅统一战线工作可以事半功倍地获得更大的成绩，整个国家的建设也一定会更迅速地达到既定的目的。
    彭泽民
    中国农工民主党中央监察委员会主席彭泽民说：中共中央三月二十五日发布的指示，不仅对中共党员有重大教育意义，特别是对于各民主党派人士和非中共党员的群众有更重大的教育意义。团结是双方的事，中共是这样不倦地、谦逊地、大公无私地对党外人士进行民主合作，作为民主党派人士的我们，应该怎样呢？我们必须要深自反省，认真检讨一下，是不是“师心自用”“自以为是”，有没有为人民服务的决心和对国事负责的精神，是不是还留着自私自利的念头。只有在这些毛病彻底清除后，才能“把国事办好”，才具备了和中共团结的基本条件。因此，我们应向中共学习，向中共看齐、坚决拥护毛主席的号召，遵照毛主席在这篇文件里所启示的各点，从实践中不断地进行自我改造和提高，这样才是善于和中共进行民主团结。尤其是毛主席指示我们说：“我们不怕说出自己的毛病，我们一定要改正自己的毛病。”是的，我们应以这样勇敢坦白和诚挚的精神，在中共领导下，对我们的毛病进行围攻，在进步的基础上进行全国的民主团结。
    马叙伦
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦说：团结合作是建设新中国的一个基本条件。中共在毛主席英明领导之下，对“非党员”的“融洽无间”证明中共党员是能执行中央的指示的。但中共中央还作检讨，怕因有少数个别的党员，不能体验这种重要性，再作一次指示，这样的态度和作风，真值得“非党员”的“钦佩”和学习。我相信绝大多数的非党员因此“闻风响应”，团结到中国共产党的周围来精诚合作。但团结合作是应该双方一样具有忠实心情的。非党员的民主人士，也应严格地检讨一下，我们有没有和中共不够精诚团结、不够精诚合作的地方？毛主席说：“共产党是为民族、为人民谋利益的政党，它本身决无私利可图。”我们有没有图私利的事实？有没有为私利的意图？还该在思想上检讨。这样才能精诚团结，精诚合作。
    许德珩
    九三学社主席许德珩说：我们读到了三月二十五日中共中央指示以后，使我们感觉到中国有这样虚怀、坦白、忠诚、时时自我警惕的中国共产党来领导我们从事中国的革命建设工作，真是我们无比的幸运，也是中国革命的幸运！为民族争生存，为人民谋利益的政党——中国共产党，已经作了这个大公无私的号召，号召改正缺点，加强团结。我们党外的人们，更应当如何的向中共看齐，向毛主席学习，加紧的自我检讨，改正错误，团结在中国共产党周围，消灭反动派，“把国事办好起来”。
