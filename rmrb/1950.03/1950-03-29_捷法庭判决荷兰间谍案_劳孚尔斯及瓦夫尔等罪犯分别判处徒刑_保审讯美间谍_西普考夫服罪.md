Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: TASS, Prague: The Czechoslovak State Court sentenced thirteen foreign spies, headed by Lauwers, the Dutch business representative in Czechoslovakia, on March 4. The court sentenced Lauwers to 15 years in prison, Wawel to 20 years in prison, and Slovincik, Rodevsky, and Huvaricky to 25 years in prison each. The other defendants were sentenced to terms ranging from three to twenty years. Three spies residing abroad—Muller, Glansky, and Fixl—were sentenced in absentia. The trial confirmed that all Dutch diplomatic personnel in Prague (including former Minister Mairis and current Dutch Chargé d'Affaires Haig) were engaged in espionage activities against the Czechoslovak Republic. They colluded with reactionary remnants in Czechoslovakia, abused their diplomatic privileges to send espionage intelligence abroad as diplomatic mail, and provided forged passports to Czechoslovak reactionaries to help them escape abroad. The trial also confirmed that Dutch military attaché Heiselman systematically engaged in military espionage against Czechoslovakia, while Lauwers and other Dutch representatives conducted espionage activities for reactionary elements in the United States and Britain, especially economic espionage. Lauwers maintained close contact with the representatives of the United States, Britain, and Canada in Prague through his assistant, Doorn.

The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest with the Dutch Legation and demanded that Haig, Heiselman, and First Secretary Rochmann leave the country within eight days.

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Comprehensive TASS, Sofia: The Sofia District Court in Bulgaria publicly tried American spy Shipkov and four others on March 6. The defendants confessed to their crimes one by one and provided details of their espionage activities. The court heard the testimonies of witnesses and the conclusions of experts and concluded the trial on the 7th.

Because the Voice of America and newspapers and news agencies in capitalist countries have repeatedly spread rumors that Shipkov was subjected to torture, the Chief Justice specifically asked Shipkov in court whether he was forced to confess due to torture. Shipkov replied, "These words are extremely ridiculous. My confession is open and voluntary."

On the 8th, Prosecutor Petlinsky delivered a speech in court, pointing out that the US Embassy in Bulgaria interfered in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and committed serious atrocities incompatible with the basic conditions of Bulgarian law, international conventions, and diplomatic ethics, and requested the court to give the defendants severe punishment.

The court announced the verdict in the case on the 8th, sentencing Shipkov to 15 years in prison and depriving him of his civil rights for 18 years; Lindova to 12 years in prison and depriving him of his civil rights for 15 years; Klatonkov to 10 years in prison and depriving him of his civil rights for 12 years; Sanov to six years and eight months in prison and depriving him of his civil rights for eight years; and Marchev to four years, five months, and ten days in prison. The defendants were also sentenced to varying amounts of fines, and their property will be confiscated by the government. The period of imprisonment of the defendants before the trial will be counted towards the sentence imposed.

    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭于三月四日宣判了以荷兰驻捷实业界代表劳孚尔斯为首的十三名外国间谍。法庭判处劳孚尔斯十五年徒刑，瓦夫尔二十年徒刑，斯洛温契克、罗德夫斯基及胡瓦里克基各二十五年徒刑。其他被告各判处三年至二十年徒刑不等。匿居外国的三名间谍——穆尔勒尔、格兰斯基及菲克斯尔被缺席判决。在审讯中证实了从事反对捷克斯洛伐克共和国的间谍活动的，还有荷兰驻布拉格全体外交人员（包括前公使麦里斯及现任荷驻捷代办海格在内），他们与捷克斯洛伐克反动残余相勾结，滥用其外交特权，将间谍情报当作外交邮件送往外国，并以伪造护照交与捷克斯洛伐克反动分子，协助他们逃亡外国。审讯并证实了荷兰武官海斯尔曼有系统地从事反对捷克斯洛伐克的军事谍报活动，劳孚尔斯及其他荷兰代表则为美英反动分子进行间谍活动——特别是经济方面的间谍活动。劳孚尔斯通过其助手多尔恩与美国、英国及加拿大驻布拉格代表保持密切联系。
    捷外交部已照会荷兰公使馆，提出严重抗议，并要求海格、海斯尔曼及一等参事罗奇曼三人在八天以内出境。
    【新华社二十八日讯】综合塔斯社索非亚消息：保加利亚索非亚地方法庭于三月六日公开审讯美国间谍西普考夫等五人，被告已一一服罪，并供出从事间谍活动的详情。法庭听取了证人的证言及专家的结论后，于七日结束审讯。
    由于美国之音电台及资本主义国家的报纸、通讯社接连散播西普考夫曾受刑讯的谣言，首席推事特在庭上讯问西普考夫是否因刑讯而被迫招供，西普考夫答称：“这些话极为可笑，我的口供是公开的并且出于自由意志。”
    八日，检察官彼特林斯基在法庭上发表演说，指出美国驻保公使馆干涉保加利亚人民共和国的内政，作出了与保国法律及国际惯例的基本条件和外交道德不相容的严重暴行，并要求法庭给予被告以严厉的惩处。
    法庭于八日宣布了对该案的判决，判处西普考夫徒刑十五年，褫夺公权十八年；林多瓦徒刑十二年，褫夺公权十五年；克拉顿考夫徒刑十年，褫夺公权十二年；萨诺夫徒刑六年零八个月，褫夺公权八年；马尔切夫徒刑四年五个月零十天。各被告并被判处数目不等的罚款，其财产将由政府予以没收。各被告在审讯前被监禁日期将计入所判刑期以内。
