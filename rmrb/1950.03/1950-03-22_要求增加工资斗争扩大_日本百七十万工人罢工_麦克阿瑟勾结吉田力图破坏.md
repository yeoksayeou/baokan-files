　　Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The various forms of strikes launched by Japanese workers to demand wage increases continue to expand. The total number of workers involved in the strikes is now close to 1.7 million. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo report: As of the 18th, the Japanese coal miners' strike is still ongoing; the rotational power outage strikes by electrical workers continue to be implemented in various regions across the country. The Japanese Chemical Industry Workers' Union and two other unions also began strikes on the 14th. According to a statistic released by the Japanese Ministry of Labor on the 15th, as cited by Agence France-Presse: In addition to the 420,000 coal miners on strike, the total number of workers participating in slowdown strikes reached 1,272,500.

    MacArthur is colluding with the Yoshida government in an attempt to undermine the strike movement. According to Kyodo News Agency, Robert, the Labor Section Chief of MacArthur's headquarters, convened a meeting between labor and management representatives of the coal mining industry on the 16th, offering "advice" on the coal mine strike issue. Kakuzae Jiro, Director of the Labor Policy Bureau of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Labor, who participated in the meeting, revealed that the so-called "advice" was an attempt to use pressure to end the strike. He said that the content of Robert's "advice" was: the Ministry of Labor should find a way to stop the current state of affairs.

    麦克阿瑟正与吉田政府勾结，力图破坏罢工运动。据共同社讯，麦克阿瑟总部劳工科布勒第十六日召集煤矿业劳资双方会谈，对煤矿罢工问题有所“劝告”。参与会议的吉田政府劳工省劳工政策局局长加久斋次郎透露：所谓“劝告”，是企图使用压力结束罢工。他说，布勒第“劝告”的内容是：劳工省应设法中止目前的状态。
