　　Forty-Five Winter Schools in Jincheng Transformed into Permanent Civilian Schools; Village Chiefs and Volunteer Teachers Gather to Discuss Specific Methods for Civilian School Learning
    [Our Dispatch] Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, convened a meeting on the 6th with eighty-one village chiefs and volunteer winter school teachers to decide to transform forty-five winter schools with a relatively strong foundation into permanent civilian schools, and discussed specific methods for the winter schools' transition to civilian schools. The county has a total of 745 winter schools, and the students generally have very good academic performance. Before the Spring Festival holiday, the county uniformly set exam questions (including four subjects: politics, culture, arithmetic, and natural science). A total of 18,084 young and middle-aged male and female students participated in the exam. The results of the test were: 2,669 people recognized 400 to 600 characters, could read the "Peasant Daily," keep a diary, and write letters, scoring 80 points or more; 10,654 people recognized more than 200 characters and could write more than 100 characters from memory, scoring 60 to 80 points; 4,761 people recognized 60 to 100 characters and failed the test. In addition, many winter schools mobilized the masses to write and perform plays, presenting many lively programs during the Spring Festival cultural activities. Each district selected sixteen rural theater troupes and eighteen square yangko dance troupes to compete in the county during the Spring Festival. The content, performance techniques, and music of these plays have all improved compared to last year. For example, the Second District's West Taiyang Village's "Seeing the Village Chief" promoted the Real Grain Public Bond, the Ninth District's West Huangshi Village's "Mutual Aid for Military Dependents," Dongguan Street's "Mutual Aid Group," and the Seventh District's Shangzhuang female volunteer teachers leading women to adapt the health education materials into "Four Six Winds" and "Cutting the Umbilical Cord," all of which were well received by the audience. The Ninth District's West Huangshi Village troupe performed "Mutual Aid for Military Dependents" at the finals on the 5th of this month. Despite the continuous rain, the masses watched in the rain until dark and were reluctant to leave, requesting continued performances.
    After the Spring Festival cultural activities, the county immediately convened a meeting on the 6th of village chiefs and volunteer teachers from villages with a relatively strong foundation in winter schools throughout the county. It was decided to transform forty-five winter schools into permanent civilian schools. At the same time, the cadres and teachers present exchanged experiences in running winter schools, studied political teaching materials, and discussed specific methods for the winter schools' transition to civilian schools. The meeting decided that village chiefs and volunteer teachers should first convey the important significance of the winter school's transition to a civilian school in detail to party members, Youth League members, and cadres in their villages; then, party members and cadres should divide the area into regions and groups, and conduct publicity and mobilization among the masses separately, to enlighten the masses' understanding of civilian schools, and explain the benefits of permanent civilian schools in connection with the masses' own interests, so as to make them consciously persist in regular learning. Party members, Youth League members, and cadres can be encouraged to take the lead and actively participate in learning through organizational education. The learning time of civilian schools should generally be maintained for two hours every day during the production season. In case of cloudy or rainy weather, conduct general tests, general inspections, general reviews, or entertainment activities. The organizational form of civilian schools is generally based on collective learning. If there are mutual aid groups, the mutual aid group will be the learning unit, and people with higher cultural levels will be selected as cultural group leaders to be responsible for leading the entire group's learning; learning groups can also be organized according to the region on a voluntary basis, and it is best to include a party member, Youth League member, or cadre in each group to play a backbone role in promoting learning. The main village cadres and volunteer teachers should arrange and check the learning of each group on time. In addition to teachers giving lessons, the learning method should also mobilize everyone to order a student character book, and mark the words on all real objects in the students' homes, such as tables, benches, knives, cases, and farm tools, to help students identify objects and learn words, and carry out learning anytime and anywhere. In addition, a literacy blackboard can also be hung under large trees where farmers rest or other places where farmers often go, to help students recognize words or conduct current affairs propaganda and popular science knowledge talks. In addition, the leaders of each village's civilian school should formulate a learning plan, and the learning content and progress should be clearly specified (such as learning several lessons or how many new words), and a certain time should be stipulated for inspection.

　　晋城四十五个冬学转为常年民校
    各村村长与义务教员集会商定民校学习具体办法
    【本报讯】山西省晋城县于六日召集八十一名村长与冬学义务教员举行会议，决定将四十五个基础较好的冬学转为常年民校，并讨论了冬学转民校的具体办法。该县共有冬学七百四十五处，一般学员学习成绩很好。在春节放假前，曾由县统一出题举行测验（包括政治、文化、算术、自然科学四科）。参加测验的男女青壮年学员共一万八千零八十四人。测验的结果：认字四百至六百、并能读农民报、作日记、写信，得八十分以上的有二千六百六十九人；认字在二百以上并能默写百字以上，得六十分至八十分的有一万零六百五十四人；认识六十至百字，测验不及格的为四千七百六十一人。此外，许多冬学并发动群众编剧演剧，在春节文娱活动中表演了许多生动节目。各区曾选出十六个农村剧团、十八个广场秧歌剧，春节在县竞赛。这些剧的内容、表演技术和音乐，均较去年提高了一步。如二区西太阳村的“见村长”内容是宣传折实公债，九区西黄石村的“互助优军”，东关街的“互助组”，七区上庄女义务教员领导妇女根据卫生教材编演的“四六风”、“剪脐带”等，均深得观众的好评。九区西黄石村剧团在本月五日决赛时演出“互助优军”，虽不断的下着雨，群众冒雨一直看到天黑还不散，要求继续再演。
    春节文娱活动结束后，该县即于六日召集全县各冬学基础较好的村庄的村长与义务教员会议。决定将四十五个冬学转为常年民校。同时，各到会干部和教员并交流了办理冬学的经验，学习了政治教材，讨论了冬学转民校的具体办法。会上决定：各村村长与义务教员回去后，首先要把冬学转民校的重要意义向本村党员、团员和干部作详细的传达；再由党团员与干部划分地区和小组，分头向群众进行宣传动员，启发群众对民校的认识，并联系群众切身利益说明常年民校的好处，使其自觉地坚持经常的学习。对党员、团员与干部，可经过组织教育，使其以身作则，积极参加学习。民校学习的时间，一般要作到生产季节每天坚持两小时。如遇天阴下雨，则进行总测验、总检查、总复习，或作娱乐活动。民校的组织形式，一般以集体学习为主。有互助组的，以互助组为学习单位，选出文化程度较高的人担任文化小组长，负责领导全组学习；也可以按地区以自愿为原则组织学习小组，每小组最好编入一个党、团员或干部起骨干推动作用。村主要干部与义务教员对各小组的学习要按时布置，按时检查。学习方法，除教员上课外，要发动每人订一学生字的本子，并在学员家中一切桌、凳、刀、案和农具等实物上标明字样，帮助学员指物识字，随时随地进行学习。此外，还可以有计划的在农民休息的大树下或其他农民常去的地方挂一识字黑板，帮助学员认字或进行时事宣传与自然科学常识的讲话等。此外，各村民校的领导方面要订出学习计划，学习内容与进度应明确订出（如学会几课或多少生字），并规定一定的时间进行检查。
