　　One Year Anniversary of the Soviet-Korean Agreement
    Kim Il-sung Writes Commemorative Article
    Stating: The Soviet Union's selfless assistance plays an important role in the growth and development of the newly established Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th】 March 17th marked the first anniversary of the signing of the "Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement." Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, wrote a special article to commemorate the occasion and to discuss the tremendous assistance that the Soviet Union has provided to Korea in economic and cultural fields over the past year. The article pointed out that according to the agreement, the trade volume between Korea and the Soviet Union in 1949 was 340,052,500 rubles, an increase of 459 percent compared to 1946; among the goods imported from the Soviet Union, 66.8 percent were machinery and equipment and fuel, and 27.3 percent were cotton and woolen fabrics most needed by the Korean people. In addition, the Soviet Union provided Korea with a loan of 222 million rubles to make up for the shortfall in Korean exports to the Soviet Union.
    The article continued: The conclusion of this agreement provided the newly established Democratic People's Republic of Korea with sufficient industrial equipment and valuable technical experience, enabling many important enterprises in the Republic, such as the Hwanghae Iron Works, the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, the Supung Power Plant, and the Pyongyang Textile Mill, to be repaired, expanded, newly established, and improved, thus ensuring the successful completion of the first year—1949—of the Two-Year People's Economic Construction Plan, and increasing the industrial production value of last year by 377 percent compared with 1946; labor productivity increased by 283 percent.
    In the cultural field, the Soviet government, in accordance with the agreement, dispatched many scholars and professors to North Korea's universities, specialized schools, and hospitals to train various cadres for Korea. In the past year alone, the Soviet Union supplied Korea with 1,500 types of university textbooks; the number of Korean students sent to study in the Soviet Union has reached more than 550; and economic and cultural delegations are constantly being sent to the Soviet Union for visits and learning.
    Kim Il-sung emphasized that all this selfless assistance from the Soviet Union plays an important role in the growth and development of the newly established Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In contrast, in South Korea, under the so-called "aid" of American imperialism, the number of factories had shrunk to 36 percent of the 1943 level last year, of which mechanical production shrank to 5 percent; the cultivated land area decreased by 45 percent compared to 1946; and prices have increased a thousand times compared to 1946. This sharp contrast between North and South Korea has educated the entire Korean people, making them more deeply aware that only by strengthening friendship with the Soviet Union can the prosperity and flourishing of the motherland be achieved.

　　朝苏协定一周年
    金日成撰文纪念
    指出：苏联大公无私的援助，对新生的朝鲜共和国的成长和发展起着重要作用。
    【新华社平壤二十日电】三月十七日是《朝、苏经济与文化互助协定》签订一周年。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成特撰文纪念，并论述苏联一年来在经济与文化方面所给予朝鲜的巨大援助。该文指出：根据该协定，朝、苏两国一九四九年的贸易额为三亿四千零五十二万五千卢布，比一九四六年增加了百分之四百五十九；其中从苏联输入的物品中，百分之六十六点八是机器设备和燃料，百分之二十七点三是朝鲜人民所最需要的棉毛织品。此外，苏联又贷给朝鲜二亿二千二百万卢布，以弥补朝鲜对苏输出的不足。
    该文继称：该协定的缔结，给新生的朝鲜共和国提供了充分的工业设备和宝贵的技术经验，使共和国的许多重要企业如黄海制铁所、兴南肥料工厂，水丰发电厂、平壤纺织厂等，得以修复、扩充、新设和改进，因而保障了二年人民经济建设计划第一年——一九四九年计划的胜利完成，使去年的工业生产额比一九四六年增加了百分之三百七十七；劳动生产率提高了百分之二百八十三。
    在文化方面，苏联政府按照该协定派遣许多学者教授到北朝鲜的各大学、专门学校以及医院，从事为朝鲜培养各种干部的工作。去年一年中，苏联供给朝鲜的大学教材共有一千五百种；朝鲜派往苏联的留学生已达五百五十余名；并不断地派遣经济和文化代表团去苏联参观与学习。
    金日成强调指出：苏联对朝鲜的这一切大公无私的援助，对新生的朝鲜共和国的成长和发展起着重要的作用。与此相反，在美帝国主义的所谓“援助”下的南朝鲜，工厂数目在去年已缩减到一九四三年的百分之三十六，其中机械生产缩减到百分之五；耕地面积比一九四六年减少了百分之四十五；而物价却比一九四六年上涨了一千倍。南北朝鲜的这种鲜明的对照，教育了全朝鲜人民，使他们更深刻地认识到只有加强对苏友好，才能达到祖国的繁荣与昌盛。
