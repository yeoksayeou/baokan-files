[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has handled 86 cases of embezzlement, corruption, and dereliction of duty in the past year. Among the serious cases, such as those involving Xia Jingui, Ma Xiangbo, Wang Zhong, Tan Hongzhu, Chen Jiahui (clerk of the Tax Bureau), and Qi Shouyao (judge of the court), the individuals involved have been subject to penalties including removal from office and transfer to the court for legal punishment. The principle of the Municipal Government in handling such cases is to combine education and punishment. In terms of handling methods, criticism and education are carried out separately according to the severity of the case, or penalties such as demerit, major demerit, transfer, demotion, or removal from office are given. Major cases are transferred to the court for legal punishment.

　　The Director of the Personnel Department of the Municipal Government presented a report on the handling of such cases at a joint office meeting. The heads of all units of the Municipal Government unanimously agreed that the continuous occurrence of such cases should attract serious attention from everyone. In the future, in addition to strengthening cadre education, timely inspection of work, and strict implementation of systems to eliminate false claims and reimbursements, all cadres should be called upon to continue to promote a hardworking and simple style and a spirit of loyalty to the people, and to raise vigilance against the temptations and influences of evil forces in the city.

    严肃处理贪污渎职案件  号召干部发扬艰苦作风
    【京市新闻处讯】京市政府在过去一年内处理贪污腐化渎职案八十六件。其中严重的如夏金贵、马相伯、王仲、谭宏铸、陈家汇（税务局办事员）及齐寿曜（法院审判员）等，都已受到撤职及移送法院依法惩办的处分。市政府处理此类案件的原则是教育与处罚结合并用。在处理的方式上，则是按照案情轻重，分别进行批评教育，或予以记过、记大过、调职、降级或撤职等处分。重大案件，则移送法院，依法惩办。
    市政府人事处处长曾就此类案件的处理情况在联合办公上提出报告。市府各单位负责人一致认为对不断发生此类案件，应该引起大家的严肃注意。今后除应加强干部教育、及时检查工作及严格执行制度杜绝冒领冒报外，并应号召全体干部，继续发扬艰苦朴素及忠于人民的思想作风，对城市中恶势力的诱惑和影响提高警惕。
