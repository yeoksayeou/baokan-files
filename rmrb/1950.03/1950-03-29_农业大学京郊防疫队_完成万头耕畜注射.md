　　Agricultural University Beijing Suburb Epidemic Prevention Team
    Completes Inoculation of Ten Thousand Head of Draught Animals

    [Report from this newspaper] The veterinary epidemic prevention team composed of faculty and students from the eight veterinary education internship stations of Agricultural University Beijing District, began conducting livestock epidemic prevention inoculation work in the three districts of Beijing suburbs, namely the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth, on the 14th. The inoculation was completed on the 21st, four days ahead of the original plan. In addition to general livestock, 10,215 draught animals were inoculated. This time, the team went to the countryside with 17 teachers and students with proficient skills as the backbone, cooperating with 43 students with less experience. Preparations were made in advance. The team members went to Fengtai to understand the draught animal situation and conducted political study and technical discussion meetings. During the work, they first cooperated with local cadres and primary school teachers and students to carry out livestock epidemic prevention propaganda to the farmers using livestock breeding associations, market days and other occasions, eliminating farmers’ erroneous concerns such as "being unable to work after being inoculated with preventive injections," "being too expensive and unable to afford the money," and "being afraid of having the livestock's blood drawn." They also told farmers about livestock hygiene knowledge, such as isolating sick animals, disinfecting with lime, promoting grass storage, and improving feed and management methods. In this way, the farmers voluntarily led the cattle for inoculation. The village chief of Guogong Village requested the team to set up a veterinary education internship station in the village. At the same time, the team paid attention to helping and improving local old veterinarians. Qin Zhankui, an old veterinarian from Dongzhimen, learned injection techniques while participating in this epidemic prevention work. Through this epidemic prevention work, the team members' skills have improved a step further. Li Guanying and other three people who did not understand injection work in the past have learned to give preventive injections. (Agricultural University Communications Group)

　　农业大学京郊防疫队
    完成万头耕畜注射
    【本报讯】农业大学北京区八个兽医教育实习工作站员生所组成的兽医防疫大队，于十四日开始在京郊十三、十四、十五等三个区进行家畜防疫注射工作，至二十一日已注射完毕，比原订计划提前四日完成。除一般家畜外，受注射的耕畜达一万零二百一十五头。该队此次下乡，以十七名技术熟练的师生为骨干，配合着四十三名经验较少的同学共同工作。事先曾作好准备工作，队员们赴丰台了解了耕畜情况，并进行了政治学习与技术讨论会等。在工作中首先配合地方干部、小学师生，利用养畜会、集市等场合，向农民进行了家畜防疫宣传。消除了农民“怕打防疫针以后不能工作”、“怕太贵了，出不起钱”、“怕抽去牲口的血”等错误的顾虑；并告诉农民以家畜卫生常识，如疫畜隔离、石灰杀菌、提倡储草、改进饲料与管理方法等。这样，使农民都自愿把牛牵来注射，郭公村村长并要求该队到该村设立兽医教育实习工作站。同时，该队注意了帮助与提高当地旧兽医，东直门的旧兽医秦占魁，在参加此次防疫工作中，学会了打针技术。经过此次防疫工作，队员们的技术提高了一步。过去不懂注射工作的李冠英等三人，已经学会了打防疫针。（农大通讯组）
