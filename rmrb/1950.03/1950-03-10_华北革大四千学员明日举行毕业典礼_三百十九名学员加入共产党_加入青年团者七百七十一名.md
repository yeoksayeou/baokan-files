　　North China Revolutionary University's 4,000 students from the Second and Third Divisions will hold a graduation ceremony tomorrow (the 11th). Liu Lantao, the president of the university, and Hou Weiyu, the director of education, delivered reports to all the students on the 1st and 2nd of this month regarding graduation and work. They instructed the students on the points to note regarding work methods and work attitude after leaving the university. They also called on everyone to unconditionally obey the organization's assignments, happily go to their work posts, continue to promote the university's fine style of hard work, simplicity, loyalty, and honesty, train and improve themselves in practical work, study hard, be good students of Chairman Mao, and fight to the end for the cause of the Chinese People's Revolution. All the graduating students of the university actively responded to this call. Under the leadership of Party and League members, all students in each class jointly wrote to the school's Party Committee, branch Party committees, or the school's Communist Youth League Committee, guaranteeing unconditional obedience to the organization's assignments and a willingness to work in the most difficult places. The university has established a preparatory committee to prepare for this graduation ceremony. In addition to holding a grand ceremony tomorrow, the art troupe will perform the drama "Victory Towards the Work Post" and the opera "Wang Xiuluan," among others.
    【Another News】On the eve of the graduation of this year's students, 319 students from various departments were approved to join the Communist Party of China, and another 771 students were approved to join the New Democratic Youth League. Grand ceremonies for joining the Party and the League were held separately a few days ago.
