　　The Wang Jingkang Case Should Be Judged Quickly
　　(I) Letter from Wang Jingkang's Mother
　　To the Editor:
　　I am from Wujiazhuang, Sixth District, Xinle County, and am 74 years old. When the mass meeting was held in the village to determine class status, my family was classified as upper-middle peasant, and several mu of land were taken away; later, some was returned. Later, when the list was posted, it was written as rich peasant. My son, Wang Fayin (Jingkang), was detained last April. The county people's court said he was against land reform and had committed a serious crime. It has been almost a year now, and the case has not been decided.
　　I believe that the People's Government will not wrongly condemn a person to death. But why hasn't the case been investigated clearly after such a long time? Is it because there isn't enough time? Although the matter is not clarified, my son will not be convicted, but it is no good to keep him in custody like this! I request the higher-level government and court to handle the matter quickly and deal with it according to policies and laws.
　　Wang Cui Shi, Mother of Wang Fayin (Jingkang), Wujiazhuang, Xinle County

　　(II) Reply from the Xinle People's Court
　　To the Editor:
　　We have read the letter sent by your newspaper from Wang Jingkang's mother in Wujiazhuang, our county. The facts are as follows: Wang Jingkang is cunning by nature. He used the excuse of reporting village cadres for concealing land to conspire to sabotage the land reform. The village cadres he reported, after being ordered by the county government to reflect on their actions, realized that they were completely instigated by Jingkang. The county government personally sent personnel to the village to understand the actual situation and confirmed that it was true, and summoned him to the county to reflect. Not only did he not show repentance, but he also made trouble with excuses. It is understood that his elder brother worked in the Kuomintang government, which he also does not admit. Why is he not allowed to return home to engage in production? The main reason is that this person's ideology has not been awakened. This is our reply.
　　Xinle County People's Court, March 10

　　Editor's Note: If Wang Jingkang's crime of conspiring to sabotage land reform is true, then the Xinle People's Court should impose a certain punishment in accordance with the laws of the People's Government. If he is detained for a year without a judgment simply because his "ideology has not been awakened," this is wrong, because the laws of the People's Government do not stipulate that one can be detained for a long time simply because his ideology is not awakened. It is hoped that the Hebei Provincial People's Court will be responsible for investigating this case and publicizing the truth. In addition, many other local courts also have some criminals who have been detained for a long time without a judgment. It is hoped that these courts will handle the pending cases quickly in order to benefit the people's production and the government's savings.

### 王景康案应速判决

　　王景康案应速判决
    （一）王景康之母来信编辑同志：
    我是新乐县六区吴家庄人，现年七十四岁。在村里开群众大会评成份时，我家被评为富裕中农，被抽了几亩地；后来又退回了一点。到后来贴榜时又写成了富农。我儿子王法寅（景康），去年四月被扣起来了。县人民法院说他是反对土地改革，犯了大罪。到现在快一年了，官司老是不判决。
    我相信人民政府是不会冤屈死一个人的。可是这么长的时间为什么案件还没有调查清楚呢？是没有功夫吧。虽然事情不弄清楚，我儿子不会判罪，可是老这样押下去也没有头！我要求上级政府法院赶快处理，按政策法令处理。
      新乐县吴家庄王法寅（景康）之母王崔氏
    （二）新乐人民法院的答复编辑同志：
    贵报寄来敝县吴家庄王景康之母的来信读悉，查事实是这样：王景康生性狡猾，他以告发村干瞒地为名，阴谋进行破坏土改，被他所告发的村干部，经县府令他们进行反省后，始知完全系受景康挑拨所致，县政府曾亲自派员到该村了解实际情况，证明无讹，即传唤该人到县反省，他不但不表示悔过，反而借词捣乱。据了解，该人之哥曾在国民党政府作事，他对此也不承认。为什么不许他回家从事生产呢？主要是该人思想没有觉悟。此复
        新乐县人民法院三月十日
    编者按：如果王景康阴谋破坏土改的罪行属实，则新乐人民法院应按人民政府法令，予以一定惩处。如因“思想没有觉悟”，即拘押一年之久而不予以判决，这是错误的，因为人民政府的法令并无因思想不觉悟即可长期拘押的规定。希望河北省人民法院负责调查此案，并把真相公布。此外，其他许多地方法院也有一些犯人长期拘禁而未判决。希望这些法院对于悬案迅速处理，以利人民的生产和政府的节约。
