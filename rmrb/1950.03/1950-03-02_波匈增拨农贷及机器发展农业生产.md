Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 1st: TASS, Warsaw: The Economic Committee under the Polish Council of Ministers recently passed a resolution on the 1950 spring sowing. The resolution points out that after Polish agriculture completed the tasks stipulated in the Three-Year Plan, the total agricultural output has increased by 85 percent compared with 1946—agricultural production increased by 80 percent, while livestock production increased by 90 percent. According to the Six-Year Plan, agricultural production is to increase by one-third, and livestock production is to increase by two-thirds. The completion of these tasks will greatly increase the production of food and industrial raw materials for the people. To achieve these goals, the Polish government has allocated millions of zlotys (Polish currency) as agricultural loans, and supplied farmers with thousands of tractors, agricultural machines, and hundreds of thousands of tons of seeds and fertilizers. The 1950 sowing plan will bring the sown area to 9.4 million hectares, of which 763,000 hectares will be sown with crops for industrial raw materials and export. The Economic Committee has approved a plan to reclaim 460,000 hectares of wasteland. The government attaches special importance to the spring sowing campaign and has allocated huge sums of money to help medium and small farmers and agricultural production cooperatives. The Economic Committee has also stipulated a number of specific tasks regarding spring sowing.
