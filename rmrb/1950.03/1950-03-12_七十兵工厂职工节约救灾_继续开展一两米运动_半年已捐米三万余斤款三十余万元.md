　　Seventy Ordnance Factory Workers Practice Thrift for Disaster Relief
    Continue "One or Two *Jin* of Rice" Movement
    Half a Year, Donated Over 30,000 *Jin* of Rice and 300,000 *Yuan*

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Disaster Relief Committee of the Beijing Seventy Ordnance Factory recently summarized its work over the past six months and decided to continue the "One or Two *Jin* of Rice" movement. The factory's disaster relief work began in September of last year, and the results have been excellent in the past half year. The factory's employees have donated a total of 30,205 *jin* of rice and over 300,000 *yuan* in cash. All of the above grain and funds have been handed over to relevant departments for transfer to disaster areas. The summary pointed out that the shortcomings in past work were: failure to hand over donations to superiors on time; failure to promptly encourage those who are particularly enthusiastic about donating; and insufficient communication with the administration and the trade union. It was decided that the above shortcomings will be vigorously overcome in the future, and disaster relief work will be done well. The factory's Disaster Relief Committee has issued a notice that, according to instructions from higher authorities, the "One or Two *Jin* of Rice" thrift and disaster relief movement will continue. The trade union immediately issued big-character posters and mimeographed special issues to mobilize employees to respond to this call. The special issue pointed out that now is the time of the spring famine, when old crops are exhausted and new ones are not yet ready, and the disaster situation is still very serious; workers and peasants are as close as brothers and sisters and should donate as much as they can. The military representative explained the significance of disaster relief to all cadres in the factory on the afternoon of the 9th, calling on everyone to contribute whatever strength they have. The whole factory responded enthusiastically, and many people signed up on the spot. Li Zhiren, director of the Seventh Institute, was the first to declare his willingness to donate 100 *jin* of rice per month. The donation figures of all the cadres of the Purchasing and Transportation Section exceeded twice the amount of rice they personally donated last year. On the afternoon of the 10th, the responsible cadres of each institute and department explained the severity of the disaster situation to the workers and comrades, and cited the vivid facts of Tangshan workers' condolences to the disaster victims, hoping that the workers and comrades of this institute would, on a voluntary basis, promote the spirit of class friendship and continue the "One or Two *Jin* of Rice" thrift and disaster relief movement. The signing-up work is underway.

　　七十兵工厂职工节约救灾
    继续开展一两米运动
    半年已捐米三万余斤款三十余万元
    【本报讯】京市七十兵工厂救灾委员会日前总结半年工作，并决定继续开展一两米运动。该厂救灾工作自去年九月开始，半年来成绩很好，全厂职工共捐米三○、二○五斤、现款三十余万元。上述粮款均已交有关部门转送灾区。总结中曾指出过去工作中的缺点是：尚不能按时将捐款交上级；对捐款特别热心者也未及时鼓励；与行政、工会联系不够等。决定今后将大力克服上述缺点，作好救灾工作。该厂救委会已发出通知，根据上级指示，继续展开一两米节约救灾运动。工会立即出大字报、油印号外，发动职工，响应这一号召。号外中指出，目前正当春荒、青黄不接的时候，而灾情仍很严重；工人农民亲如手足，应量力捐助。军代表并于九日下午给全厂干部解释救灾的意义，号召大家有一分力量，出一分力量，全场热烈响应，当场签名者甚多。七所主任李之仁首先声明自愿每月捐米一百斤。购运股全体干部捐献数字均超过去年个人所捐米数的一倍。十日下午，各所各科负责干部给工友同志说明灾情的严重，并举出唐山工人慰问灾民的生动事实，希望本所工人同志在自愿的基础上，发扬阶级友爱的精神，继续一两米节约救灾运动。签名工作正在开展中。
