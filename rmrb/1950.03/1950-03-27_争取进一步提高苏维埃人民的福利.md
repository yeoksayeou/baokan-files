Striving to Further Improve the Welfare of the Soviet People

In his historic speech at the voters' meeting on February 9, 1946, the great leader of the Party and the people, Comrade Stalin, instructed that during the post-war Five-Year Plan, special attention should be paid to expanding the production of daily necessities and raising the living standards of working people by gradually reducing the prices of various commodities.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government have resolutely and consistently implemented Comrade Stalin's instructions.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out in its message to the voters: Based on the continuously growing national economy, the welfare of our working people is steadily improving, and life is becoming richer day by day.

The most important indicator of the steady improvement of the material welfare of the working people is the increase in the national income of the Soviet Union. In the past year (1949), the national income exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 36 percent. This has enabled the material conditions of our workers, staff, farmers, and intellectuals to be significantly improved. Compared with 1940, the income of employees increased by 24 percent (calculated per worker), and the income of farmers increased by 30 percent.

As a result of the strong post-war increase in industry and agriculture, the consumption of the people's most important staple products had already exceeded the pre-war level in 1949. The increase in production was accompanied by a continued reduction in the prices of mass consumer goods. Due to the currency reform implemented at the end of 1947, the abolition of the rationing system, and the simultaneous reduction of retail prices, our people gained nearly 86 billion rubles in benefits in just one year. The second price reduction implemented on March 1, 1949, gave the working people an additional benefit of nearly 71 billion rubles. This guaranteed the increase in the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble, the increase in the real wages of employees, and the reduction of farmers' expenditures on purchasing industrial products.

The increase in the real wages of our working people is guaranteed not only by the gradual reduction of mass consumer goods, but also by the gradual increase in free benefits from the state to the people. Such as the social security fund for employees, social security payments, unpaid sanatoriums and rest homes, subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers, free medical assistance, free education, student scholarships, and annual vacation pay for all employees. In 1949 alone, residents received various free services and payments from the government totaling more than 110 billion rubles, almost twice as much as before the war (1940).

Large-scale housing construction is underway in our country. In the four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, more than 72 million square meters of living space have been repaired or rebuilt in cities. During the same period, 2.3 million Soviet apartments have been built in rural areas. Hospitals, shops, children's welfare and cultural institutions are being built everywhere.

The greatest achievement of the Soviet system is the eradication of unemployment and all the poverty associated with it. Along with economic and cultural growth, the number of employees is constantly increasing. In 1949 alone, the number of workers and staff serving in the national economic sectors increased by 1.8 million.

In the post-war years, our people have achieved great success in developing Soviet culture. In 1949, the number of students educated in Soviet schools exceeded the target set by the Five-Year Plan in 1950. The number of college students studying in universities has significantly increased compared with the pre-war period. The number of scientific research institutions has increased by one and a half times compared with 1940, and the number of scientific workers in these institutions is almost twice the number in 1940.

The Soviet people have achieved these accomplishments under the leadership of the Communist Party, thanks to the tireless care of our father and friend, the great Stalin, for the needs of the working people.

The experience of the post-war years has repeatedly confirmed that the Soviet state's concern for the people's happiness is an unchanging law of socialist society. Comrade Stalin taught that "...socialism, the socialism of Marx, is not the reduction of individual needs, but the increase and prosperity of them as much as possible, not the limitation and refusal of the satisfaction of these needs, but the full and complete satisfaction of all the needs of the cultural development of the working people."

The situation in capitalist countries is completely different. There, the living standards of working people are constantly declining, and unemployment and mass poverty are increasing. According to the materials of the United Nations Secretariat, in 1949 alone, the total number of unemployed people in the United States increased by 94.5 percent, and the number of partially unemployed workers increased to 110 percent. The number of unemployed people in the first nine months of 1949 compared with the same period in 1948 increased in: Australia – almost two times, Belgium – more than two times, France – 2.6 times, West Germany – more than two times, Japan – 1.6 times, Switzerland – 3.2 times, the Netherlands – one and a half times, Finland – 4.2 times.

The ruling groups of the United States and other capitalist countries are attempting to transfer all the burdens of the growing economic crisis onto the shoulders of the working people. In 1949, the national income of the United States decreased by 2 billion US dollars, while the income of farmers decreased by 4.7 billion US dollars during the same period. Wholesale prices in the United States are falling, but monopoly capital continues to increase retail prices in pursuit of profits. This primarily hits the vital interests of the working people.

Only in a socialist society are there no crises and unemployment, no mass poverty and bankruptcy. Only socialist society provides all the possibilities for the prosperity and cultural life of its citizens. Our achievements in improving the material welfare and cultural level of the working people are great. But the great leader Comrade Stalin taught the Communist Party and all the Soviet people not to be satisfied with the achievements already obtained, but to continue to move forward tirelessly.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) declared to the voters in its message:

"The Communist Party will, as in the past, continue to fight to improve the living standards of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party will strive to further increase the national income of the Soviet Union, increase the real wages of employees, and improve labor productivity and reduce costs so that the prices of mass consumer goods will be reduced again. The Party has set itself the task of continuing to expand the scale of housing construction, continuing to show its constant concern for improving municipal and rural administration, and showing its constant concern for improving the work of schools and hospitals, children's welfare and cultural institutions and public welfare institutions."

All the Soviet people wholeheartedly support these plans of the Communist Party – plans to seek happiness for the working people. The speeches of workers, collective farm members and intellectuals at many pre-election rallies clearly illustrate this. The Soviet people are welcoming the glorious patriotic cause of the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union with a wide-ranging socialist competition of the whole people. It also clearly illustrates this.

The Soviet people are more closely united around their combat vanguard – the Communist Party. They are more closely united around the great leader and mentor, the creator of our happy life, Comrade Stalin. The people's holiday – the election day of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is coming. Voting for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance is voting for the further improvement of the welfare of our people, for a happier, richer and more cultured life for the Soviet people, and for the victory of the great communist cause.

### 争取进一步提高苏维埃人民的福利

　　争取进一步提高苏维埃人民的福利
    党和人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志，于一九四六年二月九日在选民会议上的历史性演说中曾指示：在战后五年计划期间，将特别注意扩大日用品的生产和以逐次减低各种商品价格的方法来提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    共产党和苏维埃政府把斯大林同志的指示坚决地和一贯地付诸实现。
    联共（布）中央委员会对选民的文告中曾指出：以不断增长的国民经济为基础，我国劳动人民的福利正在稳步地提高着，生活一天天变得更富裕起来。
    劳动人民物质福利稳步提高最重要的指标，就是苏联国民收入的增加。在去年（一九四九年），国民收入超过战前一九四○年水平的百分之三十六。这使得我国工人、职员、农民和知识分子的物质情况获得显著的改善。职工收入与一九四○年比较增加了百分之二十四（按一个工人来计算），农民的收入增加了百分之三十。
    由于工业和农业强有力的战后提高的结果，人民的最重要生产品的消费，在一九四九年即已超过了战前的水平。生产的增加伴随着继续减低大众消费品的价格。由于一九四七年终所实现的币制改革和废除配给制度同时并减低零售价格，我国人民仅在一年期间内获得了近八百六十亿卢布的利益。一九四九年三月一日所实行的第二次减低价格，曾给与劳动人民近七百一十亿卢布的附加利益。这个保证了苏维埃卢布购买力的提高，职工的实际工资的增加和减缩农民购买工业品的支出。
    我国劳动人民实际工资的增加不仅由于群众消费品的逐次减低得到保证，而且还由于国家对人民逐渐增加着的免费待遇受到保证。如职工的社会保证基金，社会赡养金，不取报酬的疗养院和休养所，子女众多的母亲和单身母亲的补助金，免费的医药帮助，免费的教育，学生奖学金，一切职工的每年休假金等。仅在一九四九年内，居民曾接收政府的各种免费和支付总额超过一千一百亿卢布，几乎两倍于战前（一九四○年）。
    广大规模的房屋建设在我国正进行着。在战后五年计划的四年之中，城市中已经修复或重新建筑了七千二百万平方公尺以上的居住面积。同期内在乡村地区已建筑了二百三十万所苏维埃公寓。到处都在建筑医院、商店、儿童福利和文化机关。
    苏维埃制度的最伟大的成就是铲除了失业和与失业联系着的一切贫困。与经济和文化增长的同时职工的数目也不断地增加着。仅在一九四九年一年内，服务于国民经济部门的工人和职员的数目就增加了一百八十万人之多。
    在战后岁月中，我国人民在发展苏维埃文化方面曾获得了宏大的成就。一九四九年，在苏维埃学校受教育的学生已多于五年计划在一九五○年所决定的目标。在高等学校中学习的大学生，比战前显著地增多了。科学研究机关的数目与一九四○年比较增加了一倍半，这些机关中的科学工作者的数目几乎两倍于一九四○年之数目。
    苏维埃人民在共产党领导下，由于我们的父亲和朋友伟大的斯大林对劳动人民需要的不倦的关怀，苏维埃人民获得了这些成就。
    战后数年的经验再三证实：苏维埃国家关怀人民的幸福是社会主义社会发展的不变法则。斯大林同志教导说：“……社会主义，马克思的社会主义不是缩减个人的需要，而是尽一切可能来增进和繁荣它们，不是限制和拒绝这些需要的满足，而是充分地和完全的满足劳动人民文化发展的一切需要”。
    资本主义国家里的情况则完全不同。在那里，劳动人民的生活水平不断地下降，失业和群众的贫困在增加着。按照联合国秘书处的材料，仅在一九四九年一年内，在美国，全部失业人数增加了百分之九四点五，部分失业工人数目增至百分之一百一十。一九四九年九个月期间的失业人数与一九四八年同一时期内相比较是增加了：在澳大利——几乎两倍，在比利时——两倍多，在法国——二·六倍，在西德——两倍多，在日本——一·六倍，在瑞士——三·二倍，在荷兰——一倍半，在芬兰——四·二倍。
    美国和其他资本主义国家的统治集团企图把增长着的经济危机的一切重负都转嫁到劳动人民的肩上。一九四九年的美国国民收入减少了二十亿美元，而农民的收入在同一时期内减少了四十七亿美元。在美国批发价下降着，但垄断资本为追求利润却继续增涨零售价格。这件事首先打击劳动人民的切身利益。
    只有在社会主义社会里没有危机和失业，没有群众的贫困与破产。只有社会主义社会才给自己公民的丰裕和文化生活提供了一切可能性。在提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平事业方面我们的成就是宏大的。但是伟大领袖斯大林同志教导共产党和全体苏维埃人民不要满足于已获得的成就，要不知疲倦地继续前进。
    联共（布）中央委员会在自己的文告中向选民宣称：
    “共产党决将一如往昔地继续为提高苏联各民族人民的生活水准而斗争。共产党决将努力进一步增加苏联国民收入，增加职工的实际工资，并提高劳动生产率及减低成本以使大量消费品价格再度减低。党为自身规定任务，一如往昔地继续扩大房屋建筑的规模，继续显示其对改善市政与乡政的经常关心，显示其对改善学校与医院、儿童福利与文化机关与公众福利机关之工作的经常关心。”
    全体苏维埃人民同心协力地支持共产党这些计划——给劳动人民谋幸福的计划。工人，集体农场庄员和知识分子在许多选举前夕的集会上的演说，就明确地说明了这件事情。苏维埃人民以广泛展开全人民社会主义竞赛来迎接苏联最高苏维埃选举的光荣爱国事业。也明确地说明了这件事情。
    苏维埃人民更紧密地团结在自己的战斗先锋队——共产党周围。更紧密地团结在伟大领袖和导师，我们幸福生活创造者斯大林同志的周围了。全人民的节日——苏联最高苏维埃选举日即将来临。选民投票共产党与非党联盟候选人，就是投票拥护我国人民福利进一步的增进，拥护苏维埃人民更幸福，富裕和文化的生活，拥护伟大共产主义事业的胜利。
