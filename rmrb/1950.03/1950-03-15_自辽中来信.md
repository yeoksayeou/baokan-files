　　Letter from Liaozhong
    This is a letter from Comrade Fu Yutian from Liaozhong. County and district committee comrades should carefully study and implement it in a concrete manner to oppose formalism and truly do a good job in production and self-salvation.
        -- Liaoxi Provincial Committee, February 12

      Comrade ××:
    How to understand the disaster situation is a very difficult thing. Everything has a resisting force that prevents you from recognizing it all at once. Here, in our investigation of the disaster situation, we encountered: 1. The view of farmers relying on government relief; 2. Viewing the investigation of the disaster situation as an investigation of leftover land reform problems, fearing redistribution and struggle, being evasive and concealing the truth; 3. Unclear understanding of the unity of the people and the state, resulting in mutual probing in the investigation, both publicly and privately. If these problems cannot be resolved well, the severity of the disaster cannot be seen clearly, and therefore it will be impossible to determine how to launch production and self-salvation, and how to solve most of the problems with a small amount of relief loans.
    Therefore, it is very important to openly state the purpose (often at the People's Congress) and to be considerate to the disaster victims. Our position should be one of assistance, assisting farmers in studying how they can get through these difficult days, rather than "you say" or "even if you don't calculate, I will calculate for you," forcing orders, which only increases many doubts for farmers, not knowing what the government is up to again. We should explain the policies, rely on production and self-salvation, and explain that it is not to have grain-rich households unconditionally help disaster victims (the village head of Zhao Family Village gathered middle peasants to borrow grain from other middle peasants). Emphasize that organizing mutual aid must be voluntary and mutually beneficial, and loans must be repaid with interest; regarding Party members taking the lead, it must be explained clearly how to take the lead; some Party members and "model workers" take out a lot of things all at once, and the Party member labor heroes themselves cannot completely accept it in their minds. Also, in the investigation of the disaster situation, good village cadres must be found. The village cadre (Party member) of Qianfeng Village in the Ninth District understands the situation on a daily basis, has close relations with the masses, and has a high level of awareness. They can figure out the disaster situation pretty well; because they have some awareness, they can combine the state and the people together, for the people and for the state; because they understand the situation on a daily basis and have close ties with the masses, they can distinguish whether the disaster situation reported by the people is true or false, expose false reports, and weigh the extent of the false reports, and the reasons why they are making false reports. We should rely on such village cadres to understand the disaster situation; the method of investigation must be to investigate key points, in order to use them as a yardstick to study the disaster situation in other villages and districts, and to obtain an approximate situation of the disaster in the entire county. Otherwise, the investigation forms are piled up together, the truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished, you say a 30% discount and he says a 40% discount, making arbitrary guesses, although there are conclusions, it is difficult to help the work.
    Regarding the investigation, the focus must be on households in difficulty. The county and district levels have solved this problem, but some district cadres, especially village cadres, are very neglectful of this matter. Many forms are issued from above and are filled out generally at the bottom, how many households are organized, how much money is earned from sideline occupations, and the statistics of the percentage of sideline income to agricultural income during this period. The bottom level is very busy, and the upper level takes away such forms and really does not know what they will get out of it. The investigation of the disaster situation is not comprehensive, it is not clear how much the annual output is, the number of public grain repayment loans is not grasped, and the relationship between the market towns and production and self-salvation is not studied; what is called a severe disaster and what is called a mild disaster, there is no scale, or a complicated investigation of how many days this household eats and how many days that household eats, resulting in a busy investigation, a busy sorting out, and, in addition, many investigations have not paid attention to the reasons why the difficult households are particularly difficult, and how they plan to overcome these difficulties themselves.
    Here, in addition to calculating the big accounts according to the peeling bamboo shoots method, further divide them according to the situation in Liaozhong: 1. If the water has submerged the sorghum neck, it is a severe disaster; 2. If the water has submerged the beans and the beans are harvested very little, it is considered a mild disaster; 3. Harvesting some beans and low crops is not considered a disaster (it is said that except for two districts in Liaozhong, other districts come to collect vegetables, and large radishes come from Liaoyang, because the water is so deep on the general flat land that it has submerged the ridges). The households are divided into four types: 1. Eating until before the fifteenth day of the first month, severe disaster households; 2. Eating until Grain Rain (because it can be connected to wild vegetables) are mild disaster households; for households eating until Wheat Harvest and above, only the number of households and the population are counted. If they are also investigated one by one, the power will not be enough, and it is easy to have a lot of details, and the investigation will be untrue and add empty doubts; the former two focus on several villages in a district, and one or two natural villages in a village to conduct in-depth investigations. These people have fewer concerns than rich households, and investigate the number of households, population, and number of days of grain consumption of the first-class households. Why is it so difficult? Currently known: 1. No labor force at all (such as two blind people in one household); 2. Lazy bums; 3. Patients (who can still work when they are well); 4. Large family population, with only one labor force; 5. Although there are labor forces that can engage in light labor (spinning, weaving straw hats...), they cannot calculate, have no capital, have low skills, and have difficulties in sales; 6. Others.
    Investigating the disaster situation is to implement production and self-salvation. On the one hand, it is to make us understand the disaster situation. On the other hand, it is very important to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for production and self-salvation, and to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses. The process is as follows: At the People's Congress, launch production and self-salvation and explain the policies. It is best to explain this policy during the detailed accounting process. At the meeting, propose several households in difficulty and give them a detailed account to see if they can carry out production and self-salvation, and what they lack. A household in Laohuan Village is called Song Deku, and he does armed work in the village. At first, it seemed that because he was working, he could not take the time to engage in sideline occupations. As a result, after calculating six months, the working time only accounted for two months (actually, it would not be so much at all). Everyone warned him to work more. He said: There is no capital to do business, no cart to chop firewood, and his mother and wife have no sales for spinning. Everyone studied who to partner with and how to make an agreement; and proposed that spinning is not easy to sell due to low quality, revealing that his mother and wife are greedy and lazy, and pointing out that it is not possible to work badly. In the middle of this, the opinions of advocating unconditional help and donation were dispelled. The representatives of the conference understood that accounting and investigation were originally such a thing, "If we carry out production and self-salvation like this, what concerns do we have?" After the meeting, some representatives ran to their "contact households" to do accounting and make plans, and the situation became clearer. Before the meeting, our staff encountered considerable resistance when investigating households one by one. When we entered the household, the head of the household's face turned blue, and he was busy putting things together, and immediately explained that I am an honest person who started a family through hard work and is kind to others. After the meeting, it was significantly different. Going to help the difficult households in this way and making them work hard, finding a partner for those without a cart, and finding a living for those who have nothing to do (such as helping Yang Zhicai make sesame cakes and sell them in the market), so that the masses can benefit and get on the right track, it will be easy to do. Some people have no labor force at all, and they also thought of ways at the People's Congress, and sought the opinions of the pair of blind people and their nephew, and put them together. In this way, it is easy to understand the disaster situation. In production and self-salvation, we must reward diligence and help laziness, and form a movement. Although we cannot solve the problems of many people at once, or solve the problems of such people after a few months, but since we have launched production and self-salvation, and the masses have mastered it, the cadres and representatives will do it, are willing to do it, and we understand the disaster situation, this will lay the foundation.
    Production "self"-salvation should rely on the local cadres, the People's Congress, and the masses themselves, but many of our comrades take a negative attitude towards the cadres, do not teach the cadres, do not use the People's Congress, and do not make the masses active. On the contrary, they suppress their enthusiasm.
    Our work is for production and self-salvation, but after entering the work, many people are like entering a maze, abandoning the difficult households, forgetting to ask why they are difficult in order to help solve these difficulties, visiting and asking around, holding a meeting and giving a big speech, and busy filling in numbers on various forms that do not know what problems they are researching.
    All these methods should be corrected.
    Greetings,
    Fu Yutian, February 9
    Editor's note: We hope that Party committees at all levels will write various communications in their work and submit them to Party Life for publication. We warmly welcome such articles.

### 自辽中来信

　　自辽中来信
    这是傅雨田同志自辽中来信，各县区委同志应认真研究具体贯彻，以反对形式主义，把生产自救工作真正搞好。
        ——辽西省委  二月十二日
      ××同志：
    如何认识灾情是很难一件事，任何一件事物都有一种抗拒的力量，使你不能一下子认清他；在这里我们调查灾情中，遇到：１、农民依靠政府救济观点；２、把调查灾情看作调查土改遗留问题害怕重分重斗，支吾搪塞不露真情；３、人民与国家是一体认识不清，结果在调查中形成公摸私、私摸公相互试探。以上这些问题如不能很好解决，便不能把灾情轻重程度看清，因而也就无法确定如何发动生产自救，以及如何以少数的救济贷款解决大部的问题。
    因而开门见山说明来意（常是在人代会上），并对灾民体贴入微，便很重要。我们的位置应站在协助的地位上，协助农民研究他们如何渡过这困难日子，而不是“你讲”“你不算我也要给你算”，强迫命令，使农民凭空又增加很多疑虑，不知公家这又来干什么。我们应当讲明政策，依靠生产自救，说明不是要粮多户无条件去救济灾民（赵家村发生过闾长集合中农向中农借粮事）。强调组织互助必须自愿两利，借贷有借有还又须有利；关于党员带头，必须讲清怎样带头；有些党员“劳模”一下子就拿出很多东西，党员劳动英雄本人思想中并不能完全都接受得了。还有在调查灾情中，必须找到好的村干，九区钱缝村村干（党员）平日了解情况，与群众关系密切，觉悟高，他们便能把灾情弄个差不多；由于他们有些觉悟，他们就能把国家和人民结合在一起，为人民也为国家；由于平日了解情况与群众联系密切，他们就能够甄别老百姓所报的灾情是真是假，能揭发谎报，并能权衡谎报的程度，以及出于什么原因他才谎报。我们了解灾情要依靠这样村干；调查的方法必须是有重点地调查，以便以之为尺度来研究其他村、区的灾情调查，得出全区县灾情的近似情况，否则，调查表堆在一起，真假不辨，你说三七扣他说四六折，从心臆测，虽有结论，很难有助于工作。
    关于调查，必须以困难户为重点。县区上这个问题解决了，但一部分区干部特别村干部，对这件事是很忽视的，上边发下很多表格到底下便笼统填上，组织起来多少户，搞副业赚钱多少，统计这一时期副业收入为农业收入百分之几，底下搞的很忙乱，上边拿走这样表格真不知他会从中得出个什么来。调查灾情不全面，弄不清常年产量多少，不掌握送公粮还贷款的数目字，不研究集镇对生产自救的关系；什么叫重灾什么叫轻灾，没个尺度，或繁琐的调查这户吃几日那户吃几天，结果弄成个调查忙，整理忙，另外，许多调查未注意困难户其所以特别困难的原因，以及其自己怎样计划克服这些困难的办法。
    这里，除了依剥笋算账办法算大账外，进一步依辽中情况分别为：１、水没高粱脖为重灾；２、水没豆子，豆子收得很少算轻灾；３、收些豆子低禾作物不算灾（据说辽中除两个区外其他区都来收么菜，大萝卜都是从辽阳来，因为一般的平地水深都没了垅台）。规定户分四种：１、吃到正月十五以前，重灾户；２、吃到谷雨（因可接上野菜）为轻灾户；吃到麦秋和麦秋以上的户，只统计户数人口，如把他们也一一调查，力量来不及，也易出很多枝节，调查不实又空添疑虑；前两种则着重在一个区的几个村，一个村的一二自然屯里深入调查这些人比富裕户顾虑少，调查他们一等户的户数、人口、粮吃多少日，其所以如此困难是因为什么？目前所知者：１、根本无劳动力（如一户两个瞎子）；２、懒汉二流子；３、病人（好了还可作活）；４、家庭人口多，只有一个劳动力；５、虽有可以从事轻劳动（纺线、编草帽……）的劳动力，但不会计算，无本，技术低，销路困难等；６、其他。
    调查灾情是为了贯彻生产自救，一方面是要使我们了解灾情，另外一面很重要的在于以之激发群众生产自救的情绪，激发群众的积极性，其过程是这样：在人代会上发动生产自救，讲明政策，这个政策的交代最好是在算细账过程中进行，在大会上提出几个困难户便给他算细账，看他能否进行生产自救，他缺什么。老欢村一户叫宋德库，他作村上武装工作。开始好像由于他担任工作，拿不出时间来搞副业，结果一算六个月的时间，工作时间只占两个月（实际上根本不会这样多）。大家就告诫他多劳动，他说：作买卖无本，打柴无车，母与妻纺线无销路。大家便研究跟谁搭犋，怎样订分；并提出纺线是由于质量低才不好卖，揭发其母与妻又馋又懒，指出不好劳动是不成的。在这中间打消了提倡无条件帮助、捐助的意见，大会代表明白了算账、调查原来是这样一回事，“这样进行生产自救我们还有什么顾虑”。会后有的代表便跑到他们“联系户”那里也算账订计划，情况便进一步弄清了。会前我们工作人员，挨户调查遇到阻力相当大，我们一进门户主脸色都发青，忙着归拢东西，迎面便解释我是老实人勤劳起家，为人厚道。会后则显着不同。这样再去帮助困难户切实使之劳动起来，无车的搭上犋，无事干的为之找到可干的营生（如帮助杨植材作大饼子到集上卖），使群众得到利益上了道，就好办了。有的根本无劳动力的，人代会上也想了办法，征求了那一对瞎子与其侄子的意见，给他们归了伙。这样了解灾情便容易了。在生产自救中要奖勤扶懒，形成运动，虽然一下子不能解决很多人的问题，解决这样人几个月后的问题，但是既然发动了生产自救，并为群众掌握了，干部与代表会作了，肯干了，我们对其灾情情况又了解了，这便打下了基础。
    生产“自”救，就应该依靠该地干部、人代会与群众自己，可是我们不少同志对干部采否定态度，不去教会干部，不会运用人代会，对群众不是使其积极起来，相反的倒是压抑了其积极性。
    我们的工作是为了生产自救，但进入工作里边以后，则有不少人如入迷宫，丢开了困难户，忘记了问他为什么困难以便协助解决这些困难，东访西问，召开大会一讲一大套，忙于在各种不知为了研究什么问题的表格上，填写数字。
    这些干法都是应该改正的。
    敬礼
    傅雨田  二月九日
    编者按：我们希望各级党委都在工作中写各种通讯送交党的生活发表。我们热烈欢迎这类文章。
