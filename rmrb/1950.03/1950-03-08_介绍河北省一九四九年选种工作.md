　　Introduction to Seed Selection Work in Hebei Province in 1949
    Li Jun
    Hebei Province's seed selection work in 1949, driven by the comprehensive agricultural promotion work, initially formed a mass movement. According to existing statistics, approximately 13,473,000 jin of improved seeds were selected. It is estimated that approximately 4,389,500 mu can be planted in 1950. Based on the results of cultivating 300,000 mu of improved seed crops in 1949, calculating an average increase of 38 jin of grain and cotton per mu, the total increase is approximately 128.88 million jin. The figures are shown in the following table:
  Type                  Selected Seed (jin)                    Area Planted (mu)
  Grain                  6,831,000                            3,355,700
  Wheat                  698,000                              87,200
  Cotton                  5,069,000                            808,600
  Miscellaneous Grains   875,000                              138,000
  Total                  13,473,000                           4,389,500
    The purity of the above-selected seeds is generally around 90%.
    This seed selection movement was organized and planned from the very beginning. Hebei Province now has an agricultural extension network, which includes fourteen provincial farms, eighty-five county farms, and nearly 1,300 rural technical research groups. It has also absorbed more than 3,000 labor heroes and production models. Under the collective action of this entire extension network, the enthusiastic seed selection movement of 1949 was driven. From last spring, local farms organized seven "Si" character cotton improved seed breeding areas and fifty-six county improved wheat seed breeding areas. Furthermore, during the summer and autumn harvest seasons, extension teams organized the masses to select seeds everywhere. In many villages, seed selection committees or groups were established during the autumn harvest. For example, in Jiajia Village, Shen County, under the leadership of labor hero Jia Tongjiang's technical research group, all 428 households in the village went to the fields to conduct "field seed selection." Some even visited each other's fields to compare crops. The entire village also organized eighty-three households to exchange land for seed selection. In Dongtun Village, En County, twenty-one households bred "Guangzong White" wheat. During the summer harvest, they collectively selected 8,000 jin of wheat seeds. In addition to retaining some for their own use, they adjusted 4,000 jin to other villages. At the same time, local farms continuously educated farmers through training classes, seminars, roving exhibitions, on-site guidance, and other methods, improving the scientific and technical level of farmers' seed selection. Now, ordinary farmers recognize that seed selection is a major method for increasing production. For example, Yang Luogui, the leader of the Zhongcaokeng Technical Research Group in Ningjin County, has been selecting grain seeds for three consecutive years. The grain in his fields has no mixed ears or diseased plants. Planting the same grain and using the same fertilizer, he can harvest 20-30 jin more per mu than others. He used this actual increase in production to promote to the whole village and guide the seed selection techniques of the farmers in the whole village. Now, 80% of the farmers in the village have learned seed selection.
    In this seed selection movement, the small circle of farm improved seeds has been broken from practical experience. Farmers and farm cadres, together in the farmers' crops, have discovered many excellent varieties. Such as "Shuili Zhan" millet which is flood-resistant in Xiajin County, "Sanqiuhuang" wheat stubble corn that can yield 400 jin per mu in Shen County, "Tairenhuang" millet which can yield 500 jin per mu (irrigated land) in Zhengding County, early-maturing "Xiaochun Gu" in Ding County, and "Xiaodaoba Qigu" in Wan County, etc. The farm improved seed and the farmer improved seed are closely linked. During the autumn harvest last year, Shen County Farm selected a total of more than 43,000 jin of grain seeds of two types: the farmer improved seed "Zhuyeqing" and the farm improved seed "Huanong No. 4". The two villages of Machang Dazhai in Qinghe County selected a total of 3,400 jin of farm improved seed "Yulinbai" wheat seed. In the Lutou Village area of Ding County, village cadres led the masses to select a total of 30,000 jin of the farmer improved seed "Datouhuang" grain seed. In the ninth district of En County, fourteen village wheat competitions were organized during the summer harvest last year. The masses selected two excellent varieties, "Ziganbai" and "Dabaimang," from the fifty-six varieties participating in the competition. At that time, the masses were organized to exchange wheat seeds in large quantities. After these excellent varieties were continuously discovered from the farmers' crop fields, many farm technical cadres deeply realized the truth of "from the masses." Established a scientific viewpoint based on reality.
    In the tide of large-scale seed selection movements, farmers have not only improved technically, but also made progress politically. From the seed selection of the summer and autumn harvests and the seed adjustment of the two sowing periods of spring plowing and wheat planting, due to the in-depth publicity of the promotion work, the conservative view that "good seeds do not leave the village" was gradually overcome. The excellent wheat seeds of "Yulinbai" and "Guangzongbai" in southern Hebei Province, the excellent grain seeds of "Huanong No. 4" in central Hebei Province, and the excellent sweet potato seeds of "Okinawa No. 100" and "Nonglin No. 4" in northern Hebei Province began to be adjusted and promoted throughout the province with emphasis. Many labor heroes and production models voluntarily took out their excellent seeds to adjust them outwards. Furthermore, some counties even organized the adjustment of improved seeds to other counties. This has enabled the agricultural technology improvement movement to embark on a new road of "striving for the national production increase plan."
    Based on the above achievements and experience, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture has formulated a five-year seed selection plan. The plan requires that within five years, the province's five major crops of grain, wheat, cotton, corn, and sweet potatoes will be fully replaced with improved seeds, and yields will be generally increased by 20%. In 1950, it is planned to select 24.15 million jin of seeds. The plan clearly proposes to emphasize both farmer improved seeds and farm improved seeds, expand and strengthen the organizational leadership of the province's excellent variety promotion network, and organize the breeding and promotion of excellent varieties in a planned manner. This plan was successfully passed at the provincial agricultural technology conference in January.

　　介绍河北省一九四九年选种工作
    李俊
    河北省一九四九年的选种工作，在全面农业推广工作的推动下，初步的形成了群众性的运动。根据已有的材料统计，共选优良种籽约为一千三百四十七万斤。估计在一九五○年约能播种四百三十九万亩。根据四九年三十万亩优种作物栽培成绩，按每亩增产原粮原棉平均三十八斤计算，约共能增产一万二千八百八十万斤。数字说明如下表：
  种类                  选种斤数                    能播种亩数
  谷                    六、八三一、○○○      三、三五五、七○○
  麦                    六九八、○○○          八七、二○○
  棉                    五、○六九、○○○      八○八、六○○
  杂粮                  八七五、○○○          一三八、○○○
  总计                  一三、四七三、○○○    四、三八九、五○○
    以上所选的种籽纯度大致都在百分之九十上下。
    这个选种运动，一开始就是有组织有计划进行的。河北省现在有一个农业推广网，它包括十四个省立农场，八十五个县农场，与将近一千三百个农村技术研究小组。它还吸收了三千多劳动英雄与生产模范。在这整个推广网的集体行动下，带动起一九四九年的热烈选种运动。各地农场从去年春天，就组织了七个斯字棉优种繁殖区，与五十六个县的优良麦种繁殖区。并且在夏秋两收的季节，都由推广队到各处组织群众选种。有很多村，到秋收的时候，建立了选种委员会或小组。比如深县贾家庄，在劳动英雄贾同江的技术研究小组领导下，全村四百二十八户，家家户户都到地里进行“田间选种”。有的还互相到地里参观比庄稼。全村还组织了八十三家互相换地选种。恩县东屯村，有二十一户繁殖“广宗白”小麦。当夏收时，集体选了八千斤麦种。除本村留用，向外村调剂了四千斤。同时，各地农场不断的用训练班、座谈会、巡回展览、实地指导等方式，教育农民，提高了农民选种的科学技术水平。现在一般的农民，都认识了选种是增产的一个主要方法。如宁晋县中曹坑技术研究小组的组长杨洛桂，连着选了三年谷种，他家地里的谷子，没有杂穗或病棵。一样种谷一样粪土，一亩地就能比别人多收二三十斤。他就用这个实际增产成绩，向全村宣传，并指导全村农民的选种技术。现在全村已有百分之八十的农民，学会了选种。
    在这个选种运动中，已经从实际经验中，打破了农场优种的小圈子。农民与农场干部，共同在农家的庄稼里，发现了很多的优良品种。如夏津县抗涝的“水里站”谷子，深县一亩能收四百斤的“三秋黄”麦茬棒子，正定县一亩（水地）能收五百斤的“胎里黄”谷子，定县早熟的“小春谷”，完县的“小刀把齐谷”等。把农场优种与农民优种密切联系起来。深县农场在去年秋收的时候，选农家优种“竹叶青”及农场优种“华农四号”两种谷，共选了四万三千多斤谷种。清河县马厂大寨两个村，共选农场优种“鱼鳞白”麦种三千四百斤。定县鹿头村一带，由村干部领导群众，共选农家优种“大头黄”谷种三万斤。恩县九区，在去年夏收的时候，组织了十四个村的小麦赛会。群众从参加比赛的五十六个品种里，选出“紫杆白”与“大白芒”两个优良品种。当时就组织群众大量调换麦种。在这些优良品种，不断的从农民的庄稼地里被发现以后，使不少的农场技术干部，深刻的体会到“从群众中来”的至理名言。建立了从实际出发的科学观点。
    在大规模选种运动的浪潮里，不但使农民在技术上提高，并且在政治上也获得了进步。从夏秋两收的选种，与春耕种麦两个播种期的种籽调剂中，由于推广工作的深入宣传，逐渐的克服了“好种籽不出村”的保守观点。把河北省南部的“鱼鳞白”与“广宗白”优良麦种，与中部的“华农四号”优良谷种，北部的“冲绳百号”与“农林四号”优良甘薯种，开始有重点的向全省调剂推广。有很多的劳动英雄与生产模范，都自动的拿出他们的优良种籽，向外调剂。并且有的县还有组织的向外县调剂优种。这就使农业技术改良运动，开始走上了“为全国增产计划奋斗”的新道路。
    河北省农业厅根据以上的成绩与经验，拟定了五年选种计划。这计划的要求是在五年内把全省谷、麦、棉、玉米、甘薯五种主要作物，全面改换优种，普遍提高产量百分之二十。在五○年就计划选种二千四百一十五万斤。并在这个计划里明确的提出了，农家优种与农场优种并重，扩大与加强全省优良品种推广网的组织领导，有计划的组织优良品种的繁殖与推广工作。这个计划已在一月份全省农业技术会议上胜利的通过了。
