    Quyang Private Fuxingyu Coal Mine
    Fire Caused by Electrical Wiring Results in Explosion, Thirty-Three Workers Dead or Injured; Hebei Provincial Government Dispatches Investigation Team for Second Time
    [Our Newspaper] News: At the Shanghongtugang private Fuxingyu small coal mine in the Lingshan mining area of Quyang County, Hebei, due to the capitalist's neglect of underground construction, a gas explosion occurred on February 25th due to a fire caused by electrical wiring, killing 30 workers and injuring 3. At approximately 7:00 PM that afternoon, shortly after 55 night shift workers entered the mine, a loud explosion was heard, and a fire broke out. At the time, manager Pang Guodong fled to escape punishment. Upon hearing the news, Wang Juancheng, the CCP District Committee Secretary of the area, immediately led the District Public Security Team and arrived within an hour, organizing workers above ground to conduct a rescue operation throughout the night. Twenty-two people above the fifth chamber were fortunate to escape completely, while among the thirty-three people below the fifth chamber, twenty-seven were burned to death and six were injured. After being rescued, three of the seriously injured subsequently died.

    After learning of the incident, the Hebei Provincial Government's Department of Industry, Labor Bureau, Public Security Department, and Federation of Trade Unions successively sent personnel to the mining area to assist local governments at all levels in conducting investigations and handling the matter. According to preliminary investigation results, the mine's manager should bear full responsibility for the accident. The mine began operations in 1920s, and mining was entirely done by hand. The mine shaft was 50-60 zhang deep, divided into six chambers, with narrow and winding tunnels, poor ventilation, and extremely rudimentary equipment. The electrical wiring used underground was mostly old and damaged, and instead of using porcelain insulators, iron nails were used to fix the wires to wooden pillars, making it extremely easy to cause a fire. Prior to the accident, Li Laoqing, an experienced technician at the mine, and Zhang Dabing, the director of the trade union, had repeatedly suggested to the capitalist that the tunnels be repaired and the poor ventilation improved. The county's Federation of Trade Unions and the Lingshan Mining Bureau had also repeatedly instructed that the old and damaged wiring and pillar timbers be replaced to avoid accidents. However, the mine's manager, Pang Guodong, never adopted these suggestions, and adopted a perfunctory attitude towards instructions from higher authorities, and used hooligan tactics towards the workers, saying he wasn't making money and threatening to stop work. The workers, suffering from the pressures of life, were afraid of losing their jobs and preferred to endure rather than insist on their opinions. The local Mining Bureau also failed to conduct further in-depth inspections and supervision, leading to this major disaster.

    After the incident occurred, the capitalist has carried out preliminary compensation for the victims and their families. According to local custom and the actual ability of the mine's shareholders to bear the burden, it was decided that the capitalist would provide 48,000 jin of millet, in addition to covering the medical expenses of the injured workers, the families of the deceased would be paid eight months' salary according to their original wages.

    In order to further investigate the accident in depth and handle it cautiously, the Hebei Provincial Government has dispatched a three-person inspection team composed of the Department of Industry, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Federation of Trade Unions on the 15th to conduct a second in-depth inspection. The mine manager, Pang Guodong, has now returned, and the three-person inspection team has instructed the local government to obtain a "hard guarantee" from the manager, and will handle the matter after a thorough investigation.

　　曲阳私营复星玉煤窑
    电线走火引起爆炸  死伤工人三十三名
    河北省府二次派遣检查组调查
    【本报讯】河北曲阳县灵山矿区上红土岗私营复星玉小煤窑，因资方忽视井下修建工作，于二月二十五日因电线走火引起沼气爆炸，死工人三十人，伤三人。是日下午七时许，五十五名夜班工人下窑不久，骤闻一声炮响即发生火灾。当时经理庞国栋畏罪潜逃。该区中共区委王眷成闻讯，立即带领区公安队于一小时后赶到，组织井上工人连夜抢救。第五棚以上二十二人幸完全脱险，五棚以下的三十三人中烧死二十七人，六人受伤。救出后有重伤三名旋又死去。
    河北省府得悉后，工业厅、劳动局、公安厅及总工会均先后派员前往矿区，协助当地各级政府进行调查处理工作。据初步检查结果，此次事故的发生，应由该窑经理负完全责任。按该窑系于民国九年开始经营，完全是手工业开采。窑井深五六十丈，共分六棚，井道窄小多弯曲，通风不良，设备极为简陋。井下所用之电线多已破旧，且不用磁壶，只用铁钉钉在木柱上，极易引火。此次火灾即因电线走火，引起沼气爆炸所致。此前，该窑老技术工人李老庆，工会主任张大兵曾几次向资方提出修理井道，改善通风不良现象，该县总工会及灵山矿务局亦多次指示更换破旧电线及柱木，以免发生意外。但该窑经理庞国栋从未采纳，对上级指示采取应付态度，对工人则耍流氓手段，说没赚钱，并以停工相威胁。工人因苦于生活的压迫，唯恐失业宁可忍耐，不敢坚持意见。而当地矿务局亦未进一步深入的检查督促，致发生此次重大灾难。
    事件发生后，资方对被难者及其家属已进行初步处理。按当地旧例及该窑股东的实际负担能力，决定由资方拿出四万八千斤小米，除负责治养受伤工人外，对死难家属统按原薪发给八个月的工资。
    为进一步深入调查事故，慎重处理，河北省府已于十五日由工业厅、监察院及总工会组成三人检查小组，二次深入检查。现该窑经理庞国栋已回来，三人检查小组责成当地政府取得该经理的“硬保”，俟查明确切后，再行处理。（河北省政府工业厅）
