(Xinhua News Agency, March 16th dispatch) According to a comprehensive TASS report from Paris: The strike of metal workers in the Paris region, which began two weeks ago, is still ongoing. On the 3rd, 17,500 employees of the Paris social insurance agencies and workers in various factories of the "Water Supply Company" went on strike. Currently in Marseilles, 45,000 metal workers, chemical workers, construction workers, and food workers are on strike.

On the 13th, police again occupied several gas factories in the suburbs of Paris, the "Berliet" automobile and tractor factory in Lyon, a roller and ball bearing factory in Gennevilliers, and several power stations near Lille.

The French people are increasingly supporting the strikers. According to reports, at the suggestion of the Communist municipal councilors, the Paris Municipal Council and the Seine Provincial Council have decided to allocate 60 million francs as a fund to aid the strikers. Working people in urban and rural areas are also raising funds for the strikers. Farmers in some provinces are even collecting food for the strikers.

American sailors on the "Exermont" ship, docked in Marseilles, also expressed their solidarity. The local government, because dockworkers in the port were on strike, requested the American sailors to assist with loading the ship, but they resolutely refused to do so in order to demonstrate the solidarity of international workers.

    马赛港美国船员表示声援
    【新华社十六日讯】综合塔斯社巴黎讯：两周前开始的巴黎区域金属工人的罢工，仍在坚持中。三日，巴黎社会保险机构的职工一万七千五百人和“自来水总公司”各工厂职工，已举行罢工。目前在马赛已有四万五千金属工人、化学工人、建筑业工人和食品工人在罢工中。
    十三日，警察又占领了巴黎郊区的几个煤气工厂，里昂的“柏列尔”汽车及曳引机工厂，詹纳维列的一家滚轴及球承轴工厂和里尔附近若干电力站。
    法国人民日益增强对于罢工者的支援。据报载，由于共产党市政委员的提议，巴黎市政委员会及塞纳省省议会已决定拨款六千万法郎，作为援助罢工者的基金。城乡劳动人民也在替罢工者募集基金。某些省份的农民并为罢工者募集食品。
    停泊在马赛的美国“爱克齐特”号船员，也表示声援。当地政府因该港码头工人正在罢工，曾请求美国船员协助装船，但他们为了表示国际工人的团结一致，毅然拒绝了这项工作。
