Beijing Public Security Bureau
　　Determines Production Plan, Practices Strict Economy
　　Public Security Corps Holds Production Mobilization Meeting

[This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Public Security Bureau's Production and Economy Committee held its second meeting on the 10th to discuss issues related to the Bureau's production and economy. The meeting decided on three production plans: 1. The work of buttonholing and sewing buttons on summer uniforms will be done by the female comrades of the Bureau, which will save about five liang of millet per piece, for a total savings of more than 5,000 jin. 2. Agricultural production: With 399 mu of land, it was decided to transfer 14 people from various departments to the farm, who will return to their original posts after the autumn harvest. 3. Organize voluntary labor: The farm has 180 mu of land that is rugged and difficult to cultivate, requiring leveling. It was decided to organize all personnel to participate in voluntary labor on Sundays. In addition, the Public Security School will also participate in farm production. Currently, the school accumulates fertilizer worth about 1,000 jin of millet per month.

In addition to production, it was also decided that each unit should formulate a plan to save on public miscellaneous expenses based on February's consumption. The Bureau has had achievements in this regard in the past. Last winter, the Municipal Bureau saved a total of 520 tons of coal, and public miscellaneous expenses were reduced by more than 1,000 jin of millet. In January and February of this year, public miscellaneous expenses were reduced by a total of more than 4,300 jin of millet.

Also: The Political Department of the Beijing Public Security Corps recently held a cadre meeting to mobilize participation in labor production. After Comrade Political Commissar Yuan explained the great significance of participating in production in detail, he announced the production plan for this year, stating: The Corps' Production Committee has decided that the total production of the entire corps this year will be one million jin of millet. The production targets are: 1. Constructing salt flats. Each regiment will transfer 500 people, and the general headquarters will draw a portion of cadres and logistics personnel to engage in two months of voluntary labor. It is estimated that this year will yield 500,000 jin of millet. 2. Agricultural production: There are currently 600 mu of land, and tools are currently being prepared and planting is being planned. 3. Sideline production: Mainly selling labor, such as digging ditches, unloading goods, contracting work, and other handicraft production. When he talked about how to deal with the fruits of labor, he said: It is mainly in accordance with the spirit of taking both public and private interests into account. The specific method is a 40/60 split, that is, 60 percent goes to the state, 15 percent goes to the individual, 20 percent goes to the mess unit, and 5 percent is used as model bonuses. Finally, he said: Production is necessary, but it must never be at the expense of work or create a situation of competing with the people for profit.

　　京市公安局
    确定生产计划  厉行经费节约
    公安总队召开生产动员大会
    【本报讯】京市公安局生产节约委员会于十日召开第二次会议，讨论有关全局生产、节约问题。会议决定了三项生产计划：一、夏季制服锁扣眼及钉扣的工作，由本局女同志来作，每件计可省小米五两，共可节约五千余斤。二、农业生产：有地三百九十九亩，决定由各处抽调十四人去农场，秋收后再返回原工作岗位。三、组织义务劳动：农场有一百八十亩地坎坷难耕，需要铲平，决定组织全体人员星期日参加义务劳动。此外，公安学校也将参加农场生产，现该校每月积肥约值一千余斤小米。
    除生产外，并决定各单位应按二月份消费情况订出公杂费的节约计划。在这方面，该局过去是有成绩的。去年冬季，市局共节约烧煤五二○吨，公杂费节约一千多斤小米。今年一、二月份公杂费共节约四千三百余斤小米。
    又：京市公安总队政治部日前召开干部大会，动员参加劳动生产。该队袁政委在详细阐明参加生产的重大意义后，宣布今年生产计划称：总队生产委员会决定今年全队生产总额为一百万斤小米。生产对象是：一、建设盐滩。由各团抽调五百人，总直抽出一部分干部和勤杂人员来从事两个月的义务劳动，估计本年可收益五十万斤小米。二、农业生产：现有土地六百亩，目前正在准备工具和计划播种。三、副业生产：主要是出卖劳动力，如挖沟、卸货、包工和其他手工业生产。他谈到劳动果实的处理办法时称：主要是依照公私兼顾的精神。具体办法是四六分红，即百分之六十归国家，百分之十五归个人，百分之二十归本伙食单位，百分之五做为模范奖金。最后他称：生产是必要的，但绝不能因强调生产而妨害了工作，或形成与民争利的现象。
