[News from this newspaper] Women's freedom of marriage is still an important issue in the social life of old liberated areas. Laboring women in old liberated areas have greatly enhanced their political awareness and economic and social status through the revolutionary war, land reform, production movements, and other democratic movements. After overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule and the feudal land system, they urgently demand "equality between men and women and freedom of marriage." However, this demand is still severely hampered by the old, unreasonable marriage system.

According to statistics from the judicial departments of the people's governments in various parts of North China: marriage cases generally occupy the largest number of cases accepted by judicial organs in various places. Marriage cases in North China accounted for more than 64 percent of civil cases in the first half of last year; marriage cases in Wutai and Dingxiang counties in Shanxi Province accounted for almost all civil cases; in Meng County, a one-month statistic in September last year showed that marriage cases reached 135, accounting for more than 97 percent of all civil cases in that month. In the cases in various places, the vast majority are laboring women who were deprived of all rights under the feudal and reactionary rule in the past, and who spontaneously rise up to demand the dissolution of unreasonable marriage contracts. Among them, those who cannot bear the abuse of their husbands or parents-in-law, or who are dissatisfied with buying and selling marriages or arranged marriages, account for more than two-thirds. In rural areas of the old liberated areas, the struggle of women against feudal marriages has reached a serious level.

Unreasonable Marriage Systems Often Oppress Women to Death. Buying and Selling Marriages and Early Marriage are Still Popular in North China.

Women oppressed by unreasonable marriage systems often die as a result in the most serious cases. According to statistics from the women's federations in 59 counties in Shanxi Province: a total of 464 women's homicide cases occurred from January to October last year, of which 25 percent were persecuted to death, 40 percent committed suicide because the dissolution of marriage was unsuccessful, 20 percent committed suicide due to domestic abuse, 12 percent committed suicide due to family disputes, and 5 percent committed suicide due to giving birth to illegitimate children.

The facts that oppress men and women the most in marriage issues are that the arranged and buying and selling marriage system still exists in many places. In Dongzhaitou Village, Yishi County, Shanxi Province, with more than 100 households, 28 daughters-in-law were married last year, and the man spent more than 240 stone of wheat as a bride price, which is several times more than the village's annual public grain burden. In Beiposhang Village in the county, there is a saying that "a woman is worth one stone of grain at the age of one." In some old liberated areas in Hebei, when young men and women get married, the man has to spend a lot of cloth and grain as a betrothal gift. As for the phenomenon of early marriage decided by parents, it is still quite popular in many rural areas in North China. In five villages in the Fourth District of Xingtang County, Hebei Province, 64 couples of men and women got married last year in the second half of the year without reaching the age of marriage. Gao Quanwa in Chengguan, Yishi County, Shanxi Province, was only twelve years old when she got married. On the day of the wedding, the bridal sedan was already at the door, and she was still playing with children in the street. She was finally forcibly dragged into the bridal sedan by her parents, crying.

Judicial Cadres and Party Member Cadres in Districts and Villages Should Correct Their Ideas of Underestimating Women

The ideas and practices of underestimating women and even suppressing women still stubbornly exist among some county-level judicial departments and male cadres in districts and villages, which is an important obstacle to reforming the marriage system. They mistakenly believe that if women have freedom, "the world will be in chaos." The judicial section of Youyu County, Shanxi Province, ruled on the case of Wang Sinv in the county being stabbed and seriously injured by her husband Wang for applying for a divorce, saying: "Since you married early for three years, if the man is not good, you should persuade him well. You should not betray the virtues of your ancestors and lose your reputation. If you were not seriously injured, you should be punished with the same crime. Considering your serious injury, you will not be punished, and I hope you will reflect on yourself." In Zuoquan County, the same province, a woman was burned to death by her husband with a fire pillar, but the local government staff did not give the murderer the legal sanctions he deserved. A village cadre in the Second District of Xing County arbitrarily used "back cuffs" to "suppress" women's divorces. Many government staff members have adopted feudal and bureaucratic attitudes towards women's reasonable demands, using the excuse that freedom of marriage "only benefits women," and therefore, regardless of the circumstances, they delay or even force cohabitation for women who request a divorce. Some women have requested a divorce even more than ten times, which has been delayed for two or three years and has not been resolved. Yuan Zhenqing's wife in the Seventh District of Huixian County, Pingyuan Province, was beaten to death by Yuan Zhenqing because of the wide age gap with her husband and the extremely disharmonious relationship. The suicide incident of Deng Yunxiang, a female worker in the lathe workshop of the Dalian Shipyard Boiler Factory last year, was also a tragedy caused by the local government's failure to consider and approve her divorce request, insisting that both parties must agree to the divorce.

Another fact that deserves serious attention is that some party members in the rural branches of the Communist Party also hold feudal views on women. A peasant woman in a village in Southwest Gully, Meng County, Shanxi Province, was beaten forty times by the village branch secretary for requesting a divorce.

The above-mentioned facts indicate that the feudal marriage system in rural areas has caused considerable serious chaos, which not only affects the enthusiasm of women in production, but has also become a major social problem. How to reform the feudal marriage system in rural areas and stabilize women's production morale has become an urgent task in rural work. In particular, correcting the erroneous idea of opposing freedom of marriage among some party members and cadres in rural areas is even more urgent. This must attract the attention of leading organs in various places.

### 老解放区劳动妇女迫切要求婚姻自由  亟应改革残存的封建婚姻制度安定生产情绪

　　老解放区劳动妇女迫切要求婚姻自由
    亟应改革残存的封建婚姻制度安定生产情绪
    【本报讯】妇女婚姻自由已在目前老解放区社会生活中，仍是一个重要问题。老解放区妇女，由于经过革命战争、土地改革、生产运动，以及其他各种民主运动，已大大提高了她们的政治觉悟与经济和社会地位。她们在推翻了国民党反动统治与封建土地制度之后，迫切要求“男女平等与婚姻自由”。但是，这一要求却还受着旧的不合理的婚姻制度的严重阻碍。
    据华北各地人民政府司法部门统计：婚姻案件一般地在各地司法机关所受理案件中居最多数的地位。华北区去年上半年的婚姻案件，占民事案件的百分之六十四强；山西五台、定襄等县的民事案件，几乎全部是婚姻案件；盂县仅去年九月份一月统计，婚姻案件达一百三十五件，占全月民事案件百分之九十七以上。各地案件中，绝大多数是过去在封建反动统治下被剥夺了一切权利的劳动妇女自发地起来要求解除不合理的婚约。其中因不堪丈夫或翁婆虐待，或不满意买卖婚姻、包办婚姻的占三分之二以上。老解放区农村中，妇女反封建婚姻的斗争已达严重程度。
    不合理的婚姻制度常常压迫妇女致死  华北仍流行买卖婚姻和早婚
    受不合理婚姻制度压迫的妇女，在最严重的情况下常常因而致死。据山西五十九个县县妇联会的统计：去年一月至十月共发生妇女人命案四百六十四件，其中被迫害致死者占百分之二十五，因解除婚姻无结果而自杀者占百分之四十，因受家庭虐待自杀者占百分之二十，因家庭纠纷而自杀者占百分之十二，因产私生子而自杀者占百分之五。
    使男女在婚姻问题上最受压迫的事实，是包办买卖婚姻制度在许多地方仍然存在。山西猗氏县百余户人家的东翟头村，去年一年娶过二十八个媳妇，男方共花费了二百四十多石麦子的身价，比该村全年公粮负担大数倍。该县北坡上村流传着“女子一岁，身价一石”的说法。河北有些老解放区男女青年结婚，男方都要花费许多匹布和粮食作为聘礼。至于为父母作主的早婚现象在华北许多农村中仍然相当流行。河北行唐县四区的五个村子，去年下半年即有六十四对男女不到结婚年龄而结了婚。山西猗氏县城关高全娃年仅十二岁就结了婚，结婚的那天，花轿已抬到门前，她还在街头和小孩们玩耍，终被父母强拉着哭哭啼啼地上了花轿。
    司法干部及区村党员干部应当纠正轻视妇女的思想
    轻视妇女甚至压制妇女的思想和作风，在部分县级司法部门及区村男干部中还顽强地存在着，这是改革婚姻制度的重要障碍。他们错误地认为妇女有了自由似乎就会“天下大乱”。山西右玉县司法科对该县王四女因声请离婚而被其丈夫王某刀刺重伤一案，竟判决道：“你既早婚三载，男子不好，你应好好规劝。你不该背祖德失名声，若非重伤，应坐同罪。念你重伤，恕不治罪，望自反省。”该省左权县一妇女被丈夫用火柱穿死，当地政府工作人员竟没有给凶手以应得的法律制裁。兴县二区某村干部向要求离婚的妇女横施“背铐”刑罚，来“镇压”妇女离婚。许多政府工作人员对于妇女合理的要求采取了封建主义和官僚主义的态度，借口婚姻自由“只对妇女有利”，因而对妇女要求离婚，不问情节如何，一律拖延不决甚或强迫同居。有的妇女要求离婚甚至达十次以上，拖延了二、三年之久，还不得解决。平原省辉县七区袁振清之妻，因与其夫年龄相差太远，平素感情极不融洽，女方要求离婚，区政府不批准，强令其回家，结果竟被袁振清活活打死。去年大连船渠锅炉厂车床子女工邓云香投海事件，也是因为当地区政府不考虑与批准她的离婚要求，坚持离婚必须双方同意，而最后逼成的惨案。
    值得严重注意的另一事实，是共产党农村支部中的部分党员对妇女群众同样也抱着封建观点，山西盂县西南沟某农民妇女，因提出离婚，竟被该村支部书记打了四十大板。
    上述这些事实，表示农村中封建婚姻制度已引起相当严重的混乱，不仅影响妇女生产的积极性，而且已成为重大的社会问题。如何改革农村封建婚姻制度，安定妇女生产情绪，已成为农村工作中的迫切任务。特别是纠正农村中部分党员与干部反对婚姻自由这个错误思想，更加急要。必须引起各地领导机关的注意。
