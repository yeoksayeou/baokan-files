Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th: To ensure the completion of the national fiscal revenue plan, the Financial Department of the Central People's Government has telegraphed the financial and economic committees of all major administrative regions, urging them to promptly supervise and inspect salt tax revenue in various regions, to firmly grasp tax collection work, and to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts and the management of local salt, in order to guarantee national revenue and complete the established tasks. According to the figures reported and remitted by various regions and checked by the Central Financial Department, the salt tax revenue of various regions in January and February of this year failed to meet the original planned figures for each region. In January, the East China Region only completed 23 percent, and Changlu only completed 50 percent. In February, Changlu made efforts and completed 102 percent, but the East China Region showed no improvement, instead, it declined to about 6 percent; the Northwest Region also only reached 6 percent. In total, for January and February, Changlu performed the best, but due to the low tax revenue in January, the total only reached 77 percent of the original planned figure; Northwest reached 26 percent, and East China only reached about 15 percent. To guarantee the completion of the national fiscal revenue plan and strive to realize the 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget, the Central Financial Department has issued the above-mentioned notice, requiring all regions to supervise and inspect.

　　保证完成国家财政收入计划
    中央人民政府电告各地
    督促检查盐税收入
    【新华社北京十四日电】中央人民政府财政部顷电告各大行政区财经委员会迅速督促检查各地盐税收入，抓紧税收工作，加强缉私与土盐管理，以保证国家收入，完成既定任务。根据中央财政部收到各地报解数字检查，今年一、二两月各地区盐税收入均未能按照各区原定计划数字完成。一月份华东区仅完成百分之二十三，长芦仅完成百分之五十。二月份长芦努力结果，完成百分之一百零二，华东区仍无改进，反而下降为百分之六左右、西北区亦仅达百分之六。一、二两月合计，长芦成绩最好，但由于一月份税收太少，合计只达原定计划数的百分之七十七，西北为百分之二十六，华东仅百分之十五左右。为保证完成国家财政收入计划，努力实现一九五○年全国财政收支概算，中央财政部已发出上项通告，要求各地督促检查。
