　　Tangshan Kailuan Linxi Coal Mine
	Boiler Renovation Doubles Efficiency

　　[This newspaper reported] The renovation of the No. 9 boiler at the Tangshan Kailuan Linxi Coal Mine has been successfully completed, doubling its efficiency compared to before, providing powerful material conditions for the development of production. This furnace was installed 30 years ago and renovation started in May of last year. Thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity displayed by the workers, they found various ways to find substitutes to solve the shortage of materials and equipment such as emery in the project, and worked day and night in a continuous sprint competition, which was successfully completed at the beginning of this month. After the renovation, the furnace body was increased by three feet, and the fan was lengthened, resulting in greater wind power and stronger firepower. At the same time, smoke pipes were added to facilitate ash removal and keep the machine clean. The current gas burning efficiency has reached about 15 tons per hour, doubling the previous amount.

    改修锅炉效率倍增
    【本报讯】唐山开滦林西煤矿，改修九号锅炉胜利完工，效率较前提高一倍，为发展生产获得了有力的物质条件。该炉装修于三十年以前，在去年五月间开始改修，由于职工们发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，多方设法寻找代替物以解决工程中所缺少之金刚沙等原料和器材，并日夜不懈的突击竞赛，已于本月初胜利完工。经过改修后，炉身加高三尺，风车加长，故风力大、火力旺。同时增添了喷烟管子，使除灰方便，机器清洁。现烧气效率每小时已达十五吨左右，较前增加一倍。
