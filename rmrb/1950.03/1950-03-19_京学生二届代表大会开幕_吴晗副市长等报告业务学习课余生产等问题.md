　　Beijing Students' Second Congress Opens
    Vice Mayor Wu Han and Others Report on Academic Study, Extracurricular Production, and Other Issues

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Second Congress of Beijing Students opened yesterday morning (the 18th) in the auditorium of the Sino-French University. Present were 396 representatives from 109 universities and middle schools in the city. Guests included Beijing Municipal People's Government Vice Mayor Wu Han, Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education Weng Dujian, heads of various schools, and representatives from the Preparatory Committee of the Educational Workers' Union, including Qian Duansheng, totaling 113 people. After the congress adopted the presidium, Gu Qizong, chairman of the Municipal Student Union, delivered the opening speech, explaining that the main content of the congress was to discuss and resolve how to further promote learning, as well as extracurricular production, student union organization, and other issues. Subsequently, guests Vice Mayor Wu Han, Director Weng Dujian, Chairman of the Tsinghua University School Board Ye Qisun, Principal of Women's No. 1 Middle School Liang Yiqiu, and Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Educational Workers' Union Qian Duansheng delivered speeches in succession.

    In his speech, Vice Mayor Wu Han pointed out: In the past, some young friends believed that the purpose of studying political courses was only to transform their thinking and not to improve their professional skills. This idea is incorrect. The content of political courses is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth applicable everywhere. By studying political courses, we should use new standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to criticize and improve our professional work, thereby more deeply understanding the specific application of Marxism-Leninism and its universal correctness. Therefore, only by improving our ideological level can we improve our professional level; and only by improving our professional level will our thinking have more real and richer content. He also said: The People's Government is very concerned about the health of students, but because the Liberation War has not yet completely ended, and the country's finances are encountering difficulties in the midst of victory, the government cannot allocate a large amount of funds to improve the lives of students. Therefore, students themselves must, under the general principle of developing production, make full use of their spare time to vigorously develop school production, first of all by growing a large amount of vegetables. In this way, students will also establish labor perspectives and labor discipline during labor time.

    Director Weng Dujian said in his speech: In terms of learning, there was a phenomenon of busyness and disorder in the past year. In the future, we should strengthen the planning of learning, ensure that study time is not repeated or wasted, and that in-class and extracurricular learning are well integrated, so that there is time for self-study and thinking about problems. Regarding the issue of extracurricular school production, the difficulties encountered at the beginning are mainly caused by the idea of not valuing physical labor. Students should realize that engaging in extracurricular production can not only improve their lives but also transform their outlook on life.

    The last item in the morning was Zhou Jiyu, a student representative to the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, conveying the resolutions of the Second Session.

    The meeting continued at 2:00 PM, with Zhang Dazhong, deputy secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, reporting on learning issues, and Gu Qizong, chairman of the Municipal Student Union, conveying the resolutions of the Executive Committee of the All-China Student Federation and reporting on the work of the Student Union. In the evening, the representatives held group discussions.

    Today's (19th) agenda is: general discussion of the reports in the morning, and general discussion of the proposals and revision of the Municipal Student Union Charter in the afternoon.

### 京学生二届代表大会开幕  吴晗副市长等报告业务学习课余生产等问题

　　京学生二届代表大会开幕
    吴晗副市长等报告业务学习课余生产等问题
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：北京市学生第二届代表大会已于昨（十八）日上午在中法大学礼堂开幕。到本市大、中学一○九个单位的代表三九六人。来宾有北京市人民政府吴晗副市长、文教局翁独健局长及各校负责人等共一百一十三人。大会通过主席团后，市学联主席古奇踪致开幕词，说明这次大会的主要内容是讨论并解决如何进一步开展学习的问题及课余生产、学生会组织等。继由来宾吴晗副市长、翁独健局长、清华大学校委会主席叶企荪、女一中校长梁以俅及教育工作者工会筹委会副主席钱端升相继讲话。
    吴晗副市长在讲话中指出：过去有一部分青年朋友认为学政治课的目的，只是在于改造思想，而不在提高我们的业务。这种想法是不正确的。政治课的内容是马列主义和毛泽东思想；马列主义则是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。我们学了政治课，就要用新的立场、观点、方法来批判与改进我们的业务，从而更深刻体会到马列主义的具体运用，和它的普遍的正确性。因此，惟有提高我们的思想水平，才能提高我们的业务水平；也惟有提高我们的业务水平，才会使我们的思想有更真实更丰富的内容。他又说：人民政府对同学的健康问题十分关怀，但因为目前解放战争还未完全结束，国家财政遭遇到胜利中的困难，政府不可能抽出大批经费来提高同学的生活，所以要同学自己在发展生产的总方针下，利用课余时间，大力发展学校的生产，首先是大量种菜。这样，也会使同学在劳动时间中建立劳动观点和劳动纪律。
    翁独健局长讲话中称：在学习上，过去一年有忙乱的现象。今后应加强学习上的计划性，要作到学习时间不重复、不浪费，使课内与课外学习很好地结合起来，能够有时间自学和思考问题。关于学校课余生产问题，在目前刚开始时所碰到的一些困难，基本上是由于不重视体力劳动的思想造成的。同学们应该认识到搞课余生产不仅能改善生活，还可能改造我们的人生观。
    上午最后一项是由北京市二届各界人民代表会议学生代表周基裕传达二次会议的决议。
    下午二时继续开会，由团市工委副书记张大中报告学习问题，市学联主席古奇踪传达全国学联执委会的决议并报告学联、学生会的工作。晚上，代表们分组讨论。
    今（十九）日议程为：上午大会讨论报告，下午大会讨论提案及修改市学联章程。
    主席团名单
    【又讯】北京市学生第二届代表大会主席团名单如下：古奇踪（北大）、徐乃明（清华）、陈元方（燕大）、王恩海（交大京院）、段宝林（师大）、李如蘅（贝满）、岳玛珂（师大女附中）、刘祺（女二中）、刘炳树（师大男附中）、张永山（男二中）、赵承烈（汇文）、宁源（北师）、曹士久（市立高工）、张立生（冀高）、杜先宜（华大工学院）、朴德广（艺文）、杨联馥（辅仁女附中）、曹纯朴（新生）、徐我为（北宁助产）、宛耀宝（回民学院）、阿日（蒙藏学校）。
