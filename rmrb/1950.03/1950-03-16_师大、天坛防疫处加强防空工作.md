　　Normal University, Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center Strengthen Air Defense Work
　　[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center established an Air Defense Committee on March 1st to lead the fire brigade, the patrol team, and the ambulance team in strengthening air defense and fire prevention work. The fire brigade is currently inspecting all existing fire extinguishers and has added a batch of fire extinguishing bombs, extinguishers, water hoses, sandbags, etc. Hazardous materials and valuable instruments are being stored in safe places. Each firefighter has been assigned specific duties. The patrol team is responsible for factory protection work. Recently, they also prepared to hold an air defense drill. At the same time, the center held an emergency meeting of employees, calling on everyone to mobilize and dig air-raid shelters as much as possible without taking up work time, one for each room. All employees of the bacteria culture room get up at 5:30 in the morning to dig air-raid shelters. In addition to completing their own air-raid shelters, they also helped the packaging room, which is busier with work, to complete theirs.
