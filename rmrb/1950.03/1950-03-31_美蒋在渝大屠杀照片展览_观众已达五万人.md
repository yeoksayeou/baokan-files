　　U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek Massacre Photo Exhibition
    Visitors Reach 50,000
    [This Newspaper] The "U.S. Imperialist-Chiang Kai-shek Gang Chongqing Concentration Camp Massacre Photo Exhibition" held by the National Revolutionary Museum Preparatory Office has garnered wide attention from the public because it powerfully exposes the heinous atrocities of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents in slaughtering the Chinese people. Up to now, 215 groups have registered for group visits, and the total number of visitors, including individuals, has reached 50,000. The exhibition was originally scheduled to end at the end of this month, but due to requests for extension from the audience and organizations, it has been decided to extend it to April 10th. Group visits still need to contact the History Museum at the Meridian Gate for advance registration. After the exhibition, in order to meet the demand for loan exhibitions from other regions, it is planned to reproduce multiple copies for supply and to publish the photos and texts in a special issue.
