    (Based on Ma Feng's novel: "A Base Woman")
    (41)
    After six or seven days, Cuicui was carried down from the blockhouse. Her face was pale, and her lips had no color, barely alive. Her blind mother cried and rubbed her belly. The villagers, taking pity on her, helped with some grain. After nursing her for more than two months, she finally looked like a human again.
    (42)
    Then, her mother-in-law fell ill, and Cuicui struggled to care for her. The mother-in-law was sick for two months and died. Cuicui buried the old woman, but life at home became even more unbearable. Without grain or land, she simply resorted to selling herself for a living.

    After listening to Jin Baoniang's life story and finishing the delegates' meeting, Lao Ma realized it was already late. When he returned home, the lights were still on at Shuanshan's house. Shuanshan's mother saw Lao Ma and said, "You lectured Jin Baoniang today. People were calling for you because they had something to say, but you became suspicious. Alas! She is a poor wretch! You made her cry for a long time before I could persuade her to go back. She cried and said: I am a base woman, with no place to seek justice or complain! Alas! She was a good girl when she was young, one in a hundred miles."
    (44)
    Lao Ma felt as if a stone was pressing on his heart, feeling extremely ashamed: A revolutionary cadre, judging solely from a one-sided impression, scolded a woman who had been persecuted by the old society—a matter of great shame! Due to a sense of responsibility and the condemnation of his conscience, he couldn't sleep half the night. The next morning, Lao Ma ran to Jin Baoniang's house. They were eating breakfast. Jin Baoniang was so startled when she saw Lao Ma suddenly enter that she didn't know what to do and hurriedly swept the kang for him to sit.

    金宝娘
    邢琏画
    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （四十一）
    过了六七天，翠翠从碉堡上被抬下来，脸色青白，嘴唇没一点血色，比死人只多一口气。她瞎娘哭着给她揉肚子。村里人看她可怜，帮了些粮食，养了两个多月，她总算像个人样了。
    （四十二）
    接着，她婆婆又病倒了，翠翠挣扎着侍奉婆婆。婆婆病了二个月，死了。翠翠埋葬了老人，家中更没法活了，粮没粮，地没地，索兴就拨出身子指那事过日月。
    （四十三）
    老马听了金宝娘的身世，又开完代表会，时间已经不早了。他回去时，拴拴家还点着灯。拴拴娘见了老马就说：“今天你把金宝娘训了一顿。人家叫你是有话要说，你犯了疑。唉！那可是个苦命人！你训得人家哭了老半天，还是我劝回去的。她哭着说：我是下贱女人，连个伸冤诉苦处也没有！唉！她小时候可是个好闺女，一百里也挑不出一个来。”
    （四十四）
    老马心上好像压块石头，感到极大惭愧：一个革命工作干部，单从片面印象出发，骂了一个被旧社会逼害的女人，是一件极大的耻辱！由于责任感和良心的谴责，他半夜没有入睡。第二天清早，老马就跑到金宝娘的家。她们正在吃早饭，金宝娘见老马突然进去，嚇得不知怎好，忙扫开炕让他坐。
