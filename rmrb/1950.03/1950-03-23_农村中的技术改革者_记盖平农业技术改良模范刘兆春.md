　　A Technical Reformer in the Countryside
    ——A Record of Liu Zhaochun, a Model for Agricultural Technology Improvement in Gaiping

　　At the Liaodong Province Labor Model Conference, among nearly one hundred and ninety labor models, there was one old farmer who was the oldest. His name is Liu Zhaochun. Although he is sixty-nine years old this year, he is very strong, and he works as well as a young man. Based on practical needs in his years of labor, he has created several improved farm tools.

  I. High-Pole Scissors

　　Liu Zhaochun lives in Songshulin Village, Xujiatun District, Gaiping County. His class status is middle peasant. He learned carpentry from his father since he was a child. He can also saw vats and pots, and he can also do blacksmith work (there is a small stove at home). In his spare time from farming, he does some carpentry work for people, repairs furniture, and so on.

　　Now there are five people in his family, with more than seven mu of land. He planted more than one hundred fruit trees before and after the land reform. Therefore, in addition to farming, he also has to take care of the fruit trees.

　　One day in the spring of 1947, he was stepping on a stool to prune branches in the orchard. He was careless for a moment and fell from the stool. Next to the tree was a very deep ravine. Fortunately, he dodged nimbly and landed on the ground, saving his life, but he fainted.

　　After waking up and returning home, he lay on the kang and kept thinking about how to avoid falling. He finally figured it out: If he didn't use a stool and put a long handle on the scissors, wouldn't he be able to prune branches while standing on the ground? Therefore, after he recovered from his injuries, he made a pair of "high-pole scissors." As a result, it was both easy and labor-saving, and the effectiveness was the same. Since then, there has been no danger of falling.

  II. Wind-Powered Rattle Machine

　　More than half of Liu Zhaochun's crops are on the mountain. In the autumn of 1948, the crops in the mountains were completely ruined by wild boars. He was annoyed by this for a long time. In the spring of the following year, he even didn't want to plant this piece of land, but then he thought: What would a farm family eat and wear without planting land? After thinking it over and over, he still had to plant.

　　In the spring, the children in the village were all making small windmills out of cardboard and sorghum stalks to play with. His grandson begged him to make one too. While Liu Zhaochun was making a small windmill for his grandson, he suddenly thought: If he could make a large windmill and put a small hammer and noisemaker on it, and the windmill would automatically make a sound when it turned, wouldn't this be able to control wild boars (because wild boars are afraid of noisemakers)?

　　Sure enough, he soon made such a windmill. He installed a "bow" on the root of the wind blade. The "bow" was connected to a small hammer. When the windmill turned, the small hammer would hit the plowshare next to it, making a clanging sound. He put the windmill on top of a wooden pole and buried it in the mountain field. This can not only prevent crows from digging up seeds during spring plowing; even foxes and weasels that eat chickens and ducks will not dare to steal food when they hear this series of "sounds." When the crops are ripe, there is no need for a special person to watch over them at night. The sound of knocking the plowshare can be heard five or six li away, especially at night. If you tie a burning rope to the wind blade, it will turn into a big ring of fire, and the wild boars will be afraid of the light and will no longer dare to come to the fields to harm the crops.

　　After his invention was successful, many people in the village learned his method, protecting many crops from damage.

  III. Gaiping H耙 (H耙 is a kind of harrow)

　　Early on, he felt that using a clumsy 耲耙 to plant land was too wasteful of labor. Sowing seeds, covering the soil, stepping on the grids, even with the person holding the 耲耙, it would take four people; although the work is not heavy, it is impossible to do without one person.

　　In the spring of 1949, he thought of adding something to the 耲耙 so that it could complete all the tasks of sowing seeds, covering the soil, and stepping on the grids at once. At this time, he did not know about the "Xiong Yue 耲耙." So he figured it out at home by himself. He didn't tell anyone, fearing that people would laugh if he didn't do it well, but people found out anyway. Because his "wind-powered rattle machine" and "high-pole scissors" had already made everyone believe that he had this talent, so it was reported to him when the Farmers' Association held a meeting. The village cadres and everyone encouraged him to research it quickly.

　　While hoeing the ground, he started to make it. Because he had been studying it carefully before this, it only took two months to make the first Gaiping 耲耙. This 耲耙 has a roller in the middle, which is very light. Even a weaker livestock can pull it. It only takes one person to hold the 耲耙, saving three labor forces. The wooden roller behind the 耲耙 presses the ridges more evenly than people stepping on the grids. There are three eyes in the place where seeds are sown, which can be freely adjusted according to the dryness and wetness of the soil. It can be used to plant "by the hole" (dibbling) or "sparse rows" (strip sowing). The 耲耙 walks fast, and the seeds leak out quickly; the 耲耙 walks slowly, and the seeds leak out slowly; the 耲耙 stops, and the seeds do not leak out. In order to discover the shortcomings of this 耲耙, he repeatedly tested and modified it in the field all day long. In order to make the seed sowing the most suitable, he even counted the precise number of sorghum plants per mu, with 2,900 plants at an interval of 1.2 chi (Chinese foot, about 1/3 meter) and 2,700 plants at an interval of 1.3 chi. Millet and soybeans can also be counted in the same way. His 耲耙 can save two-thirds of the seeds. For example, to plant sorghum, three sheng (about 3 liters) of seeds are required per mu, but with this 耲耙, one sheng is enough. The current shortcoming is that it is not yet suitable for planting corn and buckwheat.

　　In the new agricultural tool exhibition room of the Liaodong Provincial Agricultural Exhibition, labor models and representatives, as well as all visitors, were very interested in his 耲耙. Everyone put seeds on it and pulled it for testing, and all agreed that it was good.

　　The Gaiping Farm will manufacture a batch this year first for promotion and trial use.

  IV. His Talk

　　At the first Liaodong Provincial People's Representative Conference, he was a people's representative of Gaiping County and was also selected as a first-class technical improvement model, receiving a prize flag, two hundred cubic meters of timber (equivalent to two million yuan), as well as medals, hoe blades, hand towels, etc. When he received the award, people admired his inventions and creations and applauded particularly warmly.

　　He said happily: "In the old society, no one cared about this. People have been farming for countless generations, all using the same old methods. No one cared if you figured out new tools. Now it's very different. If you have an invention, the government will reward you. Don't think I'm almost seventy years old. I'm going to continue to research new things when I go back. Not only that, but I'm also going to promote the use of new farm tools and new methods of farming. I'll be back for the Labor Model Conference next year!"

### 农村中的技术改革者——记盖平农业技术改良模范刘兆春

　　农村中的技术改革者
    ——记盖平农业技术改良模范刘兆春
    在辽东省劳模大会上，将近一百九十位的劳动模范里，有一位年纪最大的老农民。他的名字叫刘兆春。虽然今年已有六十九岁，但是，身板儿却是很硬实，干起活来也顶上了一个小伙子。他在长年的劳动中根据实际需要，创造出来好几种改良农具。
  一、高杆剪子
    刘兆春住在盖平县徐家屯区松树屯村，成份是中农，从小跟他的父亲学过木匠手艺，他还会锯缸、锯锅，也会干铁匠活（家里有一个小炉），种地的余暇，就给人家做点木工零活，修理家具等等。
    现在他家里有五口人，有七亩多地，土改前后栽了一百多棵果树。所以他在种地之外还要侍弄果树。
    一九四七年春天，有一天他在果园里踏着凳子剪树枝，一时没加小心，从凳子上摔了下来。树旁是一个很深的山沟，幸亏他机灵地一闪，落到地上，保住了一条命，但却摔晕了。
    醒过来回家后，躺在炕上，他总在想怎样才能不挨摔。他终于想出道眼来了：假如不用凳子，在剪子上按上个长把，站在地上不也一样能剪枝吗？因之，当他养好了伤之后，就做了一把“高杆剪子”。结果既省事又省劲，效力还是一样大，从此再也没有摔倒的危险了。
  二、风摇机
    刘兆春的庄稼多一半在山上，一九四八年秋季，山里的庄稼被野猪糟蹋得一干二净，他为这事懊恼了很久。到第二年春天，他甚至不想种这块地了，但又一想：庄稼院不种地指什么吃穿呢？前思后想还是得种。
    春天，村子里的小孩们都用硬纸片和秫秸做个小风车跑着玩。他的孙子央告他也给作一个。刘兆春在给孙子作小风车的当儿，忽然想：如果能做一个大型的风车，按上个小锤子和响器，风车一转，能自动打出响来，这难道不可以治野猪吗（因为野猪怕响器）？
    果然，不久他做出了这样一个风车，在风桨根上按上个“弓子”，“弓子”连着个小锤子，风车一转小锤子就猛敲旁边的铧子，发出当当响声。他把风车按在木头杆子顶上，埋在山地里。这不但在春耕的时候，可以防止老鸦扒种籽吃；就是吃鸡鸭的狐狸和黄鼠狼子，听见这个一连串的“响声”，也不敢再来偷嘴了。庄稼成熟的时候，晚上也不用专人去看青，敲铧子声可以传到五、六里地远，尤其在夜间再在风桨上绑上火绳，转起来成一个大火圈，野猪怕火亮就再也不敢到地里来祸害庄稼了。
    他的发明成功以后，全村有不少人都学会了他的办法，保住了很多的庄稼不受损害。
  三、盖平耲耙
    很早他就觉得用笨耲耙种地太浪费人工。撒种，扶“拉子”（盖土），踩格子，连扶耲耙的就得四个人；活儿虽然不重，可是少一个人也不行。
    一九四九年春天他就想，把耲耙上添些东西，使撒种，盖土，踩格子这些活儿叫他一下子都作完。这时他还不知道有“熊岳耲耙”。于是他就自己在家捉摸。他并没有和任何人讲过，恐怕作不好人家笑话，可是到底被人家知道了。因为他的“风摇机”和“高杆剪子”，已经使大家相信他有这种才能，于是在农会开会的时候就给他报上去了。村干部和大伙都鼓励他快点研究出来。
    在铲地的时候，他就着手作了。因为在这以前也早就用心研究过，所以只用两个来月的时间，就做成了第一台盖平耲耙。这个耲耙中间有一个轱轳，很轻巧，用一头软弱点的牲口也能拉，只用一个人扶耲耙，节省了三个人工。耲耙后边的木头轱轳，压起垅来比人踩格子还均匀。撒种的地方有三个眼儿，可以按土质的干湿自由调整，种“按儿”（点播）或种“拉拉稀”（条播）都行。耲耙走的快，种籽漏的也快；耲耙走的慢，种籽漏的也慢；耲耙停止了，种籽也就不漏了。他为了发现这耲耙的缺点，就整天的在地里反复的试验，反复的修改。为了使种籽撒的最合适，他甚至数出了种一亩地的高粱，一尺二的间隔要二千九百棵，一尺三的间隔要二千七百棵的精确数字。谷子、大豆，也都照样数得出来。他这个耲耙可以节省三分之二的种子。比如种高粱，一亩地要用三升种籽，用这个耲耙有一升就够了。现在存在的缺点是种苞米和荞麦还不行。
    在辽东省农展的新农具展览室里，劳动模范和代表们以及所有的参观的人对他这耲耙感到极大兴趣，大家放上种籽拉着试验，都一致认为不错。
    盖平农场将要在今年先制造一批，以便推广试用。
    四、他的谈话
    辽东省第一届人民代表会议上，他是盖平县人民代表，同时又被选为一等技术改良模范，得了一面奖旗，和二百立米木材（核二百万元），还有奖章，锄板，手巾等。当他领奖的时候，人们钦佩他的发明创造，特别热烈的鼓掌。
    他高兴的说：“在旧社会里没人理这个碴，人们种地种了不知多少辈子了，都用那老一套的死法子，捉摸出新的家什来也没人管。现在可大不相同了，有了发明政府还奖励咱们。别看我快七十岁的人了，回去还要接着研究新的，这还不算，还要推动大伙使用新农具，和用新法子种地。过年劳模会我还要来！”
