Chahar Daily News, 16th: Since the Yantongshan Mine of Longyan Iron Mine in Chahar Province launched the production and conservation, anti-waste, and rationalization proposal campaign in February, the output and quality of ore have improved compared to the past, and consumption has decreased. The original plan for February was to produce 12,000 tons of ore, but with everyone's active efforts, 12,882.7 tons were overproduced. The average output per worker also increased by 0.04 tons compared to January, reaching 0.6 tons. The consumption of raw materials has also decreased compared to last month. For example, in January, the average consumption per ton of ore was 4-inch nitroglycerin 6.15 rolls (rounded off to three decimal places), aluminum powder explosives 0.18 rolls, electric detonators 3.10, fuse 2.81 meters, and calcium carbide 0.12 kg; in February, the average per ton was: 4-inch nitroglycerin 6.02 rolls, aluminum powder explosives 0.18 rolls, detonators 3.01, fuse 2.76 meters, and calcium carbide 0.10 kg. Other aspects such as loading, ore transportation, ore dressing, tunneling, and saving water and electricity have also achieved significant results. For example, Comrade Zhang Zhijun, the secretary of the General Party Branch of the ore dressing plant, suggested frequently wiping the dirt from the oil bowls and rollers of the mine cars, and repairing and extending the broken willow baskets and iron wires used for ore dressing, saving 50 jin of lubricating oil, 63 jin of iron wire, and 185 willow baskets throughout the month. Moreover, pushing the mine cars became easier and faster than before. Under the leadership of Comrade Cai Desheng, the loading team voluntarily reduced from 35 to 30 people, which not only did not affect loading but also freed up time to automatically help the ore dressing team select ore. In the western 20th pit, everyone came up with ideas to improve the drilling technology, deepening the past 1.5-meter deep holes to 2.5 meters, while using only half a more charge (from 1.5 to 2 charges). Consumption decreased and footage increased rapidly. Due to the strengthening of ore dressing work, the iron content of the ore produced has consistently remained above 45%, recently reaching 47%. In addition, there have been significant gains in saving electricity and water. Since March, this campaign has moved towards the development of creating new records. Under the leadership of team leader Comrade Zhao Wangui, the western 20th pit proposed to produce 0.83 tons per worker per day and strive to reach one ton, aiming to exceed the highest standard of the entire mine in February—the western 18th pit's average output of 0.81 tons per worker. Administratively, the production plan for March was set at 600 tons per day, which was revised by everyone to 650 tons. On March 7th, the administrative, trade union, Party, and Youth League general branches of the mine held a general mobilization meeting for all employees, calling on everyone to launch a new record-breaking production campaign. It called on Party and Youth League members to be models in this campaign. After the meeting, everyone's enthusiasm for production intensified, and on the 8th, the total output reached 705 tons. In the past few days, various tunnels and sites have been enthusiastically conducting elections for production activists and labor models, formulating their own work plans, and studying how to improve production and create new records. They are preparing to welcome the Xuan City commendation and model worker award conference, which will be held at the end of March and the beginning of April, by creating new production records.

　　察省龙烟铁矿烟筒山矿场
    生产量提高消耗减少现已转入创纪录运动
    【本报讯】察哈尔日报十六日消息：龙烟铁矿烟筒山矿场，自从二月份发起生产节约、反对浪费、开展合理化建议以来，矿石产量质量均较前提高，消耗减少。二月份原计划产矿石一万二千吨，但在大家积极努力下，超额完成一万二千八百八十二吨七。每工总平均亦较一月上升○·○四吨，而达○·六吨。原材料的消耗，也比上月减少了。如一月出一吨矿平均要用四英寸长硝?甘油，炸药六·一五卷（小数点以后三位四舍五入下同）、铝粉炸药○·一八卷、电管三·一○个、引线二·八一米、电石○·一二公斤；二月每吨平均则为：四英寸长硝?甘油炸药六·○二卷、铝粉炸药○·一八卷、雷管三·○一个、引线二·七六米、电石○·一○公斤。其他如装车、运矿、选矿、打掘进，以及节省水电等，也同样取得不少成绩。如选矿场中共支部书记张志钧同志，建议勤擦矿车油碗和滚珠上的污物，把选矿用的破柳条筐、铁丝经收拾接长再用，使全月节省机油五十市斤、铁丝六十三市斤、柳条筐一百八十五个。而且矿车推起来，还比早先又轻便又快。装车班在蔡德生同志带头号召下，自动由三十五人减至三十人，不但未影响装车，还挤出时间，自动帮助选矿班选矿。西部二十坑，大家出主意想办法，改进了打眼技术，把过去一米五深的眼加深至二米五，而用炮却只多了半个（过去个半，现二个）消耗少，进尺快。由于选矿工作的加强，保证了所出矿砂含铁量经常在百分之四十五以上，近来并达百分之四十七。此外，在节电省水方面，也有不小的收获。三月以来，这一运动已走向创造新纪录的道路发展。西部二十坑，在领班赵万贵同志的带头下，提出要每工日产○·八三吨，争取达到一吨，要求超过二月份全场最高标准——每工平均产○·八一吨的西部十八坑。行政上订出三月份日产六百吨的生产计划，被大家修改为六百五十吨。三月七日，该场行政、工会、党、团总支，又召开全体职工大会动员大会，号召大家展开创造生产新纪录运动。号召党、团员在这一运动中要作模范。会后，大家生产劲头更加紧张起来，八日，总产量竟达七百○五吨。这几天，各个坑道、现场，都正在热烈地进行着评选生产积极分子和劳动模范，制订自己的工作计划，研究怎样搞好生产、创造新纪录。准备以创造生产新纪录，来迎接将于三月底四月初召开的宣市评功奖模大会。
