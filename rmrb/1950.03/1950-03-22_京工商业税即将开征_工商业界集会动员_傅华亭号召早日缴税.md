[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Industrial and Commercial Federation Preparatory Committee convened a mobilization meeting yesterday afternoon (21st) for heads of various industry associations to discuss the upcoming levy of the Beijing Municipality's industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949. Zhao Zishang, Director of the Municipal Taxation Bureau, and Ma Yingzhong, Deputy Director, were invited to give reports. The meeting was chaired by Fu Huating, Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Federation Preparatory Committee, and was attended by approximately 300 people. Director Zhao Zishang, in his report, explained the government's current basic financial situation and then discussed the methods for collecting the industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949, saying: Only partial and individual adjustments have been made to various industries this time because: 1. The collection time has been delayed due to the promotion of public bonds and cannot be delayed further; 2. The assessment during the collection of the first half year's tax last year already referenced the situation at that time, even was based on the situation at that time, and there has not been much change since then; 3. Everyone can save time, and the government can complete its work sooner. Regarding how to achieve fairness and reasonableness in tax payment, Director Zhao said: Under the current method of democratic appraisal, it still mainly relies on the assistance of industrial and commercial figures participating in the appraisal work. As long as everyone is conscientious, responsible, and selfless in carrying out the appraisal work, this can be achieved. Director Zhao solemnly addressed rumors at the meeting that some people were spreading before the government announced the collection of this tax, saying: The industrial and commercial tax is increased every time and will be increased to the point where industrial and commercial households cannot afford it. He said: The fact that this tax levy is lighter than the previous one has already answered this rumor. The government will absolutely strictly follow the spirit and tax rates of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax promulgated by the central government and carry out the collection work based on the principle of taking both public and private interests into consideration. After Director Zhao's speech, Deputy Director Ma Yingzhong reported on the current implementation of industrial and commercial tax collection. Finally, Chairman Fu Huating spoke, saying: Based on past experience, I believe that we can complete our task because our thinking is different from the past. I hope that after we all return, we will mobilize the members of various industries to work quickly and pay taxes early.

　　京工商业税即将开征
    工商业界集会动员
    傅华亭号召早日缴税
    【京市新闻处讯】京市一九四九年下半年度工商业税即将开征，市工商联合会筹备委员会特于昨（二十一）日下午召集各行业公会负责人开动员大会，请市税务局长赵子尚、副局长马应中作报告。大会由工商联合会筹备委员会主任委员傅华亭主席，到会约三百人。赵子尚局长在报告中于阐述了政府目前财经基本状况后，谈到一九四九年下半年度工商业税征收的方法时说：此次各行业分只作了部分个别的调整，是因为：一、征收时间因推销公债已拖延了下来，不能再拖下去；二、去年下半年征上半年税时，评分已参照了当时情况的，甚而是根据当时情况的，到现在变动不大；三、大家可以耽误时间少，政府工作可以完成早。至于如何在纳税当中，求得公平合理，赵局长说：在目前尚采取民主评议的方式下，还主要靠参加评议工作的工商界人士多多协助，只要大家是认真负责，大公无私的进行评议工作，便可以做到这一点。赵局长在会上曾对有人在政府尚未宣布征收此税前，说：工商业税次次加，将加得工商业户不能负担下去的谣言作了郑重声明，他说：这次征税较上次为轻的事实便已回答了这个谣言。政府绝对严格按照中央颁布的工商业税暂行条例的精神与税率，在公私兼顾的原则下来进行征收工作。赵局长讲话后，马应中副局长报告了目前工商业税征收执行的情况，大会最后由傅华亭主任委员讲话，他说：根据过去经验，我相信我们是可以完成我们的任务的，因为我们的思想跟过去不同了。希望我们大家回去后动员各行业的会员，赶紧工作，早日缴税。
