　　Wanting to Follow the Old Path of War Criminal Tojo
    US-UK Group Prepares for Germ Warfare
    【Xinhua News Agency, 19th】 The US-UK bloc is actively preparing for the heinous germ warfare. According to an AFP dispatch from Ottawa on the 16th, the US, Britain, and Canada are currently holding secret talks in Ottawa regarding chemical and bacteriological warfare. Canadian Department of Defence officials have adamantly refused to disclose where the negotiations are taking place, but well-informed sources say that the participating "scientists" are gathering in a church in Ottawa. The source also stated that the negotiations are due to the three countries' defense ministers hoping to exchange "scientific intelligence" so that the three countries can benefit from discoveries. The US-UK-Canada's sinister negotiations once again confirm that the US-UK imperialist bloc is actively preparing for inhumane germ warfare, and also explain why the US State Department rejected the Soviet government's suggestion on February 3 to interrogate the five major Japanese germ warfare criminals in Japan. And why Ishii Shiro, the famous organizer and theorist of germ warfare, suddenly "disappeared", because they themselves are also the creators of this monstrous crime. As is well known, as early as February 1948, the Washington Post reported that a research station for bacteriological weapons was established near Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. In the autumn of 1947, the station was allocated a test site for conducting experiments on spreading infectious bacteria from airplanes.

    美英集团准备细菌战争
    【新华社十九日讯】美英集团正在积极准备万恶的细菌战争。据法新社渥太华十六日电，美、英、加三国目前正在渥太华举行关于化学及细菌战争的秘密谈判。加国防部官员坚决拒绝说明谈判在何处举行，但据消息灵通人士称，与会的“科学家们”系在渥太华一教堂中集会。该人士又称：谈判是由于三国国防部长希望交换“科学情报”，以便使三国能因有所发现而获益。美英加的罪恶谈判再次证实了美英帝国主义集团正在积极准备残无人道的细菌战争同时也说明了美国国务院为什么拒绝苏联政府二月三日关于审讯在日本的五大细菌战犯的建议，而其中著名的细菌战的组织者与理论家石井四郎，为什么会突告“失踪”，因为他们自己也正是这一滔天罪恶的制造者。如所周知，早在一九四八年二月，华盛顿邮报即曾报道：美国首都华盛顿附近，设有一个研究细菌武器的实验站。该站一九四七年秋曾被拨给一片试验场，以便进行从飞机上散播传染病菌的试验。
