Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, March 19th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress continued its discussion of Secretary-General Rafael's report at the morning session on the 18th.

　　Soviet representative Gagarina stated in her speech that women all over the world are increasingly aware that the guarantee of peaceful labor and the security of working men and women's families are determined by the unity and determination to defend the cause of peace. Therefore, the sacred slogan, "We cannot wait for peace, we must rise up and fight for peace," has received tremendous support from the masses of women. As an Executive Committee member of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), I know that the national women's organizations from the 59 countries participating in the WIDF have intensified their activities to fight for peace, heroically and fearlessly calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments, the signing of peace pacts, and the cessation of wars against the people of Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya. Wherever they are, women are showing that they are active fighters for peace. They will never choose any other path. The burden of war weighs particularly heavily on the shoulders of women. There is no greater sorrow in the world than the pain felt by a mother who has lost her child. Humanity paid a very high price to defeat German, Italian fascism, and Japanese imperialism. Millions of families suffer from the loss of loved ones. Countless mothers have forever lost their children. We Soviet women suffer the most from the damage of war. We know what war is. Women in every country mourning their loved ones, women mourning their dead children, husbands, and brothers, will certainly wage a firm and unyielding struggle to defend peace. Gagarina concluded by saying that everyone knows that new war provocateurs are attempting to slander the Soviet people and accuse them of having aggressive intentions. But the people of the world fully understand that this is nonsense.

　　Also speaking at the morning session of the Standing Committee on the 18th were representatives of the German Democratic Republic, Fred Marter; China, Xiao San; the United States, Roach; and Brazil, Moda Lima, among others.

　　保证和平劳动与家庭安全
    世界广大妇女争取和平
    苏代表嘉嘉里娜在和大常委会议上发言
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩十九日讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会十八日上午会议，继续讨论和大常委会总书记拉斐德的报告。
    苏联代表嘉嘉里娜在会上发言称：全世界妇女越来越了解到：和平劳动的保证及劳动男女家庭的安全，都决定于团结与保卫和平事业的决心。所以，“我们不能坐待和平，必须起来争取和平”这一神圣的口号，就得到了妇女群众的巨大支持。作为国际民主妇联的执行委员，我知道参加国际民主妇联的五十九个国家的全国性的妇女组织，已经加紧它们争取和平的活动，英勇无畏地大声疾呼，要求禁止原子武器、减缩军备、签订和平公约、和停止反对越南、印尼和马来亚人民的战争。无论在什么地方，妇女都表现出她们是积极的和平斗士。她们决不会选择其他的路径。战争的负担特别沉重地压在妇女肩上。人间最大的辛酸，莫过于失去了孩子的母亲所感到的痛苦了。为了战胜德、意法西斯及日本帝国主义，人类付出了很高的代价。数以百万计的家庭因失去亲人而感到痛苦。不可胜数的母亲永远失掉了她们的儿女。我们苏联妇女因战争的损害而痛苦最甚。我们深知什么是战争。每一个国家内悼念她们钟爱的人们的妇女，悼念他们死去的儿女、丈夫及兄弟的妇女，一定会为保卫和平而进行坚强不屈的斗争。嘉嘉里娜最后说：大家都知道，新战争挑拨者企图诽谤苏联人民，谴责苏联人民有侵略意图。但世界各国的人民完全明白这是无稽之谈。
    在和大常委会十八日上午会议上发言的，尚有德意志民主共和国代表福雷德·马尔特，中国代表萧三和美国代表罗奇及巴西代表莫达·利马等人。
