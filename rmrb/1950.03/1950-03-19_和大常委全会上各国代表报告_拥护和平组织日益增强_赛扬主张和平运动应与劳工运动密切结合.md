　　Reports from Representatives of Various Countries at the Enlarged Meeting of the World Peace Council Standing Committee
    Peace Organizations Increasingly Strengthened
    Saillant Advocates Close Integration of Peace Movement with Labor Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, TASS, Stockholm]: The Third Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates of Peace discussed the report of the Standing Committee's Secretary-General, Jean Lafitte, on March 16th. British representative Platts-Mills suggested that the Standing Committee make further efforts to have the U.S. Congress receive a delegation from the Standing Committee. U.S. representative Kent agreed with this suggestion.
    Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke, stating, "We must ensure that propaganda and action are more closely linked. In this regard, we should emulate dockworkers and seamen." Saillant spoke of the need to increase peace committees in various enterprises. These committees should closely cooperate with local peace advocacy committees. He pointed out, "In order to consolidate the unity of peace forces, the peace movement should cooperate with the labor movement. Peace advocates should give workers all assistance in establishing closer unity and mutual solidarity between workers in one country and workers in other countries. We must unite all classes of society to fight for peace. This must be taken as our goal in every country."
    French representative Boulier spoke of how to encourage those who ideologically support peace to actively participate in the peace movement. He suggested reprinting the declaration of Christian groups at the World Congress of Advocates of Peace in Paris. Boulier declared, "For us, neutrality is impossible."
    Representatives from Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Syria, Belgium, Bulgaria, and Algeria spoke in succession, describing the peace movements in their respective countries and the problems that each country must solve in order to expand and consolidate the peace advocacy movement organizationally. These speakers pointed out that, despite the various obstacles erected by reactionaries, the peace advocacy movement has greatly expanded and strengthened organizationally since the last meeting of the Standing Committee, and in some countries the struggle for peace has taken on a more concrete nature and has entered the stage of practical action. The representatives expressed the determination of peace advocacy organizations in various countries to continue to expose the criminal activities of warmongers and to develop and strengthen the struggle of the peace movement more vigorously.

　　和大常委全会上各国代表报告
    拥护和平组织日益增强
    赛扬主张和平运动应与劳工运动密切结合
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次全体会议，于三月十六日讨论了常委会总书记约翰·拉斐德的报告。英国代表普拉茨——米尔斯建议常设委员会再行设法使美国国会接见常委会代表团。美国代表肯特赞同这一建议。
    世界工联总书记路易·赛扬继起发言称：“我们一定要保证使宣传和行动更紧密地联系起来。在这方面，我们应当效法码头工人与海员。”赛扬谈到增加各企业中和平委员会的必要。这些委员会应与各地方的拥护和平委员会密切配合。他指出：“为了巩固和平力量的团结，拥护和平运动应与劳工运动合作。和平拥护者在一国工人与其他国家的工人建立更紧密的团结和相互声援时，应给予工人们一切帮助。我们必须团结社会上一切阶级来为和平而斗争。必须把这一点当作我们在各个国家中的目标。”
    法国代表鲍立尔谈到怎样推动那些思想上拥护和平的人们积极参加和平运动的问题。他建议再度刊印基督教团体在巴黎世界拥护和平大会上的宣言。鲍立尔宣称：“对我们来说，中立是不可能的。”
    捷克、英国、意大利、叙利亚、比利时、保加利亚及阿尔及利亚等国代表相继发言，叙述他们国家中的和平运动，以及各该国为在组织上扩大并巩固拥护和平运动所必须解决的问题。这些演说者指出：尽管反动分子竖立各种障碍，但自常设委员会上次会议以来，拥护和平运动在组织上已经大大地扩展和加强了，在若干国家中争取和平的斗争已有更具体的性质，并且已进入实际行动的阶段。代表们表示各国拥护和平组织的决心，即更加努力地继续暴露战争贩子的罪恶活动，发展并加强和平运动的斗争。
