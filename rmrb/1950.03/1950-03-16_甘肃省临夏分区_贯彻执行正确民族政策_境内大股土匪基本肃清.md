Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 15th: Linxia Prefecture in Gansu Province, where various ethnic groups live together, has gradually corrected the serious errors made in the implementation of ethnic policies in September and October of last year by determining that resolutely implementing the ethnic policies in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the central link in the current suppression of bandits and all other work. As a result, major bandit groups within the territory have been basically eliminated.

The Linxia area was the old nest of bandit leaders such as Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui, and it is also an area where various ethnic groups such as Hui, Han, Tibetan, and Mongolian live together. Due to the consistent instigation of ethnic divisions between Hui and Han by the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties, especially the Ma Bufang bandit gang, long-term and acute ethnic antagonism was created. In history there were even multiple incidents of Hui-Han feuds. After the area was liberated in mid-August last year, the people's government and the People's Liberation Army stationed there initially publicized ethnic policies, respected the customs and habits of all ethnic groups, and united some middle and upper class individuals, thereby winning the support of the broad masses of the people. However, from late September to October, defeated officers and soldiers of the Ma bandits successively returned to Linxia with weapons, and the number of bandits gradually increased. In addition, the Linxia Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had residual great Han chauvinist ideas in its leadership and lacked a clear class viewpoint in the implementation of ethnic policies, carrying out social reforms too hastily. This gave the remaining reactionary elements of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma bandit gangs hidden among the Hui and Han ethnic groups an opportunity to take advantage of. For a time, secret agents, habitual bandits, and some former military officers and landlords of the Ma bandit gang colluded with each other, wantonly provoking ethnic relations. They held "symposiums" in five counties including Ningding, Kangle, Hezheng, Linxia, and Yongqing, organized reactionary armed forces, established the "Truth Society," and put forward the slogan "Resist the Communists and Eliminate the Han," creating an armed disturbance with a mass character for a time. At that time, the total number of large and small bandit groups in the entire prefecture, including coerced masses, reached seven or eight thousand people. The county seat of Ningding was besieged on November 17th of last year. During the serious bandit situation, a very large number of people fled or were affected, and several incidents of Hui-Han feuds occurred.

Some cadres had narrow-minded nationalist ideas leading to errors in the implementation of ethnic policies.

The main errors made by the Linxia Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the implementation of ethnic policies were: 1. On the issue of political power, the principle of ethnic equality in the Common Program was not implemented, and a joint government of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society was not organized. Many county governments in Hui-Han mixed areas did not have Hui cadres, or had very few. In some places, the public security and judicial organs were all Han people, while most of those arrested and detained were Hui people, and there was not enough concern for the lives of Hui prisoners. Therefore, the Hui people believed that "Han people are officials, and Hui people are in prison." 2. The Hui and Han populations in the prefecture were equal in number, but when organizing the militia, the prefectural leadership decided that Han people should account for two-thirds of the militia organization, while in reality the Hui people accounted for only five percent. In addition, the militia was organized too early, and no attention was paid to examining the composition of the militia, resulting in many local ruffians and Han revenge-seekers in the militia. As a result, Han militiamen engaged in retaliatory acts of beating Hui people in the countryside. 3. The Linxia Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not pay enough attention to the complex ethnic characteristics of Linxia and did not first take effective measures to strengthen ethnic unity. It mechanically applied the work experience of old areas and purely Han areas, and confiscated civilian firearms. During the confiscation of firearms, some areas saw illegal phenomena of torture and coercion to force the handing over of firearms. As a result, the firearms of good people were mostly confiscated, while the firearms of bad people were rarely confiscated. Thus, because of the simultaneous confiscation of firearms and organization of the militia, and the militia was mostly Han people, the Hui people believed that "confiscating the firearms of the Hui people is to arm the Han people." Bandits also took the opportunity to put forward the slogan "Protecting guns is protecting lives, and protecting lives is protecting religion" to resist the confiscation of guns. 4. The slogans of opposing local bullies and reducing rent were put forward too early. Under conditions when the Hui and Han masses had not yet raised their awareness and ethnic disputes had not yet stopped, some cadres mistakenly believed that only by opposing local bullies and reducing rent could the masses be mobilized and reactionary elements isolated. The result was exactly the opposite: this approach made it easier for reactionary elements among the Hui and Han ethnic groups to provoke and expand ethnic disputes. 5. United front work was not carried out well. In the early days of Linxia's liberation, the unity of a part of the middle and upper strata in the Hui and Han people who were willing to cooperate with the people's government had a good impact. This proves that the more complex the ethnic situation and the greater the feudal forces in a region, the more important it is to win over and unite all classes and all ethnic groups in the united front work. However, the leading organs of Linxia Prefecture did not deeply appreciate this and implement it. 6. The erroneous method of "grabbing the big heads" in grain borrowing further aroused the panic of the middle and upper classes of all ethnic groups, and some even secretly supported the bandits, waiting for a "change of regime." 7. There was insufficient understanding of the bandit suppression policy that emphasized political persuasion and the mass-based armed disturbances in Linxia Prefecture, and it was once erroneously proposed to replace the policy of political persuasion with a simple military suppression policy of "unconditional surrender." The main reasons for the above errors were that some cadres had blurred class viewpoints, residual great Han chauvinist ideas, and had not deeply analyzed the class relations in the Hui ethnic group. They did not clearly distinguish between the small number of political bandits among the Hui people and the coerced bandits and the broad masses of the Hui people. They also did not recognize that the estrangement between the Hui and Han people after liberation was the result of the old rule, especially the criminal rule of the Ma bandits. Some cadres did not use scientific methods of analysis to deal with ethnic issues, but instead used narrow-minded nationalist ideas to wrongly understand ethnic issues, and some even absurdly said: "Hui people's food can be eaten, but their words cannot be listened to," "The Han people in Linxia area are an oppressed minority," and so on. Secondly, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not pay enough attention to the ethnic issues in Linxia, and only gave general instructions in September and October, lacking in-depth inspection and specific assistance and correction.

The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting to stipulate concrete policies to correct errors.

Since November of last year, the above errors have been gradually corrected and changed. In mid-December last year, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of the secretaries of the prefectural committees of various prefectures to conduct a special review of the Linxia issue, and determined that the current urgent task in Linxia is: based on the principles of ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance, to take all effective measures to immediately stop the incidents of Hui and Han people killing each other, stabilize social order, and determine this as the starting point for all work in Linxia. Then, on the basis of the unity of all ethnic groups, democratic reforms will be carried out in a step-by-step manner according to the needs of the actual situation. The meeting decided: 1. Implement the bandit suppression policy with political persuasion as the main focus. Mobilize the masses, unite the people of all ethnic groups and all members of society who are willing to cooperate with the people's government, eliminate bandits, and stabilize the people's hearts. Those who were coerced and are willing to return home to produce will not be held accountable for the past. Those whose main members surrender with their troops will not be killed or humiliated, and will be dealt with leniently. Those who are willing to accept reorganization should be actively incorporated and transformed. For stubborn bandits and scattered bandits who have been completely isolated among the Hui and Han people, choose an appropriate time to annihilate them. The sentencing of captured bandits, especially Hui bandits, should be based on an in-depth understanding of the reactions of the Hui and Han masses, and should not be handled hastily or sentenced improperly. 2. Each county should hold representative meetings of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society, promote the spirit of ethnic unity, and convey policies, so that representatives of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society can assist the government in its work, and this should be regarded as the main method of uniting the people of all ethnic groups to implement policies. 3. It is recommended that all levels of government earnestly absorb and cultivate Hui people to take up work, and the Party and military organs should pay attention to cultivating Hui cadres and absorb them to participate in work. At the same time, Han cadres must be educated to take the initiative to closely unite with Hui cadres. Strengthen the provincial and county ethnic affairs committees to make them organs that reflect the demands of all ethnic groups and mediate disputes among ethnic groups. It is recommended that the administrative office establish a consultation committee under the leadership of the commissioner that includes representatives from all ethnic groups. 4. It is recommended that the local people's courts quickly and carefully mediate disputes between the Hui and Han people. When backlog cases are heard by the court, representatives of the Hui and Han people should be invited to attend and resolve them appropriately on a case-by-case basis. Deeply persuade and explicitly prohibit mutual killings among the Hui, Han, Mongolian, and Tibetan peoples; those who deliberately defy the prohibition should be punished according to law with the consent of the majority of the peoples involved. Widely use and promote the method of Hui-Han People's Unity Association to enlighten the class consciousness of the Hui and Han people, appropriately resolve disputes, and strengthen Hui-Han unity. 5. Organize the people of all ethnic groups to produce and provide disaster relief, actively organize winter production, and prepare for spring plowing. 6. Run training classes for minority cadres, regarding the training of a large number of minority cadres as the key to doing minority work well. 7. Immediately concentrate on reorganizing and training the militia guerrillas, and cleaning up local ruffians. 8. Immediately clear the prisons and unconditionally release all lightly accused prisoners and battlefield captives (except for heinous counter-revolutionaries); those who wish to return home will be given travel expenses. Torture is strictly prohibited, and those who violate this will be punished. 9. Immediately convene meetings of cadres at all levels to deeply convey the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the meeting of the secretaries of the prefectural committees of the Chinese Communist Party, and repeatedly educate all cadres and soldiers about ethnic policies. The meeting of the secretaries of the Gansu prefectural committees also decided on the following three matters: 1. Except for the firearms of the leading reactionary elements of the riots that must be confiscated, the civilian firearms of all ethnic groups, including ordinary landlords and rich peasants, will not be confiscated or registered; after mobilizing the masses, they will be transformed into mass self-defense armed forces. 2. The militia will be organized only after the Hui and Han masses have raised their political awareness, have a ideological basis for ethnic unity, and both have legitimate demands for armed self-defense. 3. At present, efforts should be concentrated on attacking the leading reactionary elements (i.e., the public enemies of the people within each ethnic group) to achieve ethnic unity and stabilize local order, and not to oppose local bullies too early.

Serious improvements over the past two months have united the people of all ethnic groups.

In the past two months, the leading organs of Linxia Prefecture, according to the above instructions, first required all subordinate counties to actively cultivate minority cadres, especially in Ningding and Hezheng, where the Hui people are in the majority. The prefectural leading organs clearly stipulated that in areas where the Hui and Han peoples live together, an appropriate number of cadres from all ethnic groups should be assigned according to the proportion of the population. To date, the prefecture has trained more than 250 Hui and Tibetan cadres, and 31 Hui and Tibetan cadres have been assigned to the prefecture-level organs. Zhang Leshan (Hui) has been appointed deputy commissioner, and there are six Hui county magistrates and deputy county magistrates, one mayor, and eleven county-level section chiefs. There are a total of 49 Hui cadres above the county level, which has initially strengthened the connection between the people's government and the Hui masses. They have also mobilized the Hui and Han masses to sign mutual assistance covenants, calling on them to help each other, respect each other, and avoid discriminatory remarks and retaliatory behavior. From January 9th to 14th, the Linxia Administrative Office convened a meeting of judicial arbitrators from various counties, which decided that ethnic disputes will be mediated and handled in accordance with the principle of ethnic unity, with the participation of representatives of all ethnic groups and personnel from the Ethnic Affairs Committee. The use of corporal punishment is strictly prohibited, and education and transformation should be the guiding principles. At the same time, due to the earnest implementation of the bandit suppression policy with political persuasion as the main focus, and the active use of all social forces to carry out bandit suppression work, four or five hundred bandits have been successively registered in Hezheng and Linxia counties, and large bandit groups have also surrendered one after another. In January, Ma Baoke, the head of the large bandit group originally active in the Ningding and Linxia areas, had sent representatives to request surrender. On January 14th, bandit leaders Ma Xueliang, Sun Shaoye, and others led more than 100 bandits with weapons to surrender to the people's government. On the 15th, more than 40 bandit leaders and bandit leader You Gaoshan led more than 100 bandits to surrender to the people's government and turned over weapons, mules, and horses. In addition, Ma Wu (pseudo regimental commander) of Ma Bawa's bandit group surrendered on January 17th with more than 40 troops. At present, the large bandit groups within the Linxia Prefecture have been basically eliminated (only Ma Bawa's group remains). A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Ningding, in order to mobilize the masses and completely eliminate bandits and secret agents, transferred 35 cadres and formed two armed work teams on January 13th. Cooperating with the cadres of Ningding County, they set off separately on the 18th to carry out local work. The Gansu Provincial People's Government also transferred 20 cadres to form a work group, which went to Linxia Prefecture on January 18th to help with the work. On January 18th, the Prefectural Administrative Office convened an expanded political affairs meeting, focusing on discussing the combination of mediating Hui-Han disputes and carrying out production and disaster relief work. The meeting decided to mobilize disaster victims, make full use of kinship and friendship relations, help each other, invigorate rural lending, and ensure that loans are repaid and that burdens are not increased due to lending. In addition, prosperous wealthy households were especially mobilized to donate money to provide disaster relief. The meeting also decided to establish production and disaster relief committees at all levels above the prefecture. This work is now gradually unfolding. Recently, the Gansu Provincial People's Government has also allocated 100 million yuan in emergency relief funds and 1,000 dan of seeds to be used for production and disaster relief in the prefecture; at the same time, it issued instructions on production and disaster relief, requiring people's governments at all levels in the prefecture to correctly publicize ethnic policies and mobilize refugees to return home for production. As of February 15th, 50 percent of the more than 10,000 refugee households who had fled to Linxia City had returned home for production; the rest are also being gradually relocated with the help of the people's government.

　　甘肃省临夏分区
    贯彻执行正确民族政策  境内大股土匪基本肃清
    【新华社西安十五日电】甘肃省民族杂居的临夏分区，由于确定了以坚决贯彻人民政协共同纲领中的民族政策为当前剿匪和其它一切工作的中心环节后，已逐渐纠正去年九、十月间在执行民族政策中所犯的严重错误，从而基本上肃清了境内大股土匪。
    临夏地区是马步芳、马鸿逵等匪首的老巢，又是回、汉、藏、蒙等各民族杂居的地区，由于历代反动统治阶级，尤其是马步芳匪帮一贯地挑拨回汉民族间团结，致造成长期的尖锐的民族对立，甚至历史上曾发生多次回汉仇杀。该地区在去年八月中旬解放后，开始时，人民政府和驻地人民解放军宣传了民族政策，尊重各族人民风俗习惯和团结了一部分中上层人士，因而取得广大人民的拥护。但自九月下旬至十月间，马匪溃败官兵陆续携械逃回临夏，土匪日渐增多；加以中共临夏地委在领导上存在着大民族主义的残余思想，在执行民族政策中阶级观点不明确，过急地进行社会改革，更给隐藏在回、汉民族中的蒋、马匪帮的残余反动分子以可乘之机。一时特务、惯匪及马匪帮的某些旧军官和地主等互相勾结，大肆挑拨民族关系。他们在宁定、康乐、和政、临夏、永清等五县举行“座谈会”，组织反动武装，建立“真理会”，提出“抗共灭汉”口号，造成一度带有群众性的武装骚乱。当时全分区大小股匪连同胁从群众竟达七、八千人。宁定县城曾于去年十一月十七日被围攻。在匪情严重时，逃难和受波动的群众甚广，并发生若干回、汉之间仇杀的事件。
    有些干部存在狭隘民族主义思想造成执行民族政策的错误
    中共临夏分区地委在执行民族政策上犯的主要错误是：一、在政权问题上，没有贯彻共同纲领中民族平等的原则，组织各族各界的联合政府。许多回、汉杂居的县政府中没有回民干部，或者很少。有的地方公安、司法机关都是汉人，而被捕管押的又多是回民，对回民犯人的生活也不够关心。因此回民便认为“汉人做官，回民坐监”。二、该分区回、汉人口为数相等，但在组织民兵时，分区领导机关却决定民兵组织中汉民占三分之二，而组织的结果回民只占百分之五。加以组织民兵过早，又不注意考查民兵成份，致民兵中有不少地痞流氓和汉族报复主义者，因而汉族民兵在农村中有吊打回民的报复行为。三、中共临夏地委对临夏民族复杂的特点重视不够，没有首先采取有效措施，加强民族团结，只机械地搬用了老区和纯汉人地区的工作经验，收缴了民间枪支；收枪时部分地区曾发生拷打逼枪的违法现象。这种做法的结果，好人的枪支多被收缴，而坏人的枪支则收的很少。这样，由于一面收枪，一面组织民兵，民兵又大部分是汉人，故回民认为“收缴回民的枪支武装汉人”；土匪亦乘机提出“保枪就是保命，保命就是保教”的口号，以对抗收枪。四、过早地提出反恶霸、减租口号。在回、汉群众觉悟尚未提高和民族纠纷尚未停止的情况下，有些干部即错误地认为只有反恶霸、减租才能发动群众，孤立反动分子。结果恰恰相反，这种做法却更便于回、汉民族中的反动分子挑拨和扩大民族纠纷。五、没有很好地进行统一战线工作。临夏解放初期，曾因团结了一部分愿与人民政府合作的回汉人民中的中上层分子，影响良好。这证明越在民族复杂和封建势力大的地区，争取和团结各阶层各民族的统一战线工作越是重要。但临夏分区的领导机关对此却未深刻体会并加以贯彻。六、在借粮中采取了“抓大头”的错误办法，更引起了各民族中中上层分子的恐慌，有的甚至暗中支持土匪，等待“变天”。七、对用政治争取为主的剿匪政策和临夏分区带有群众性的武装扰乱，认识不足，曾经错误地提出用“无条件投降”的单纯军事清剿的方针来代替政治争取为主的方针。上述错误产生的主要原因，是部分干部阶级观点模糊，存在大民族主义的残余思想，对回族中的阶级关系，未加深刻分析；对回民中少数的政治土匪与被胁从的匪徒和广大回民群众，未加明确区别；也没有认清解放后回汉人民之间的隔阂是旧统治特别是马匪的罪恶统治的结果。有些干部不用科学的分析方法去处理民族问题，而以狭隘的民族主义思想，错误地去认识民族问题，甚至有人荒谬地说：“回民的饭吃得，话听不得”，“临夏地区的汉人是被压迫的少数民族”等。其次是由于中共甘肃省委对临夏民族问题，重视不够，只在九、十月间作了一般指示，缺乏深入的检查和具体帮助与纠正。
    中共甘肃省委召集会议规定具体方针纠正错误
    自去年十一月起，对上述错误已逐渐得到纠正和转变。中共甘肃省委于去年十二月中旬召开了各分区地委书记会议，对临夏问题作了专题检讨，确定临夏当前的迫切任务是：根据民族平等、团结、互助的原则，采取一切有效措施，立即制止回、汉人民仇杀事件，安定社会秩序，确定以此作为临夏一切工作的出发点，然后在各族人民团结的基础上，根据实际情况的需要，有步骤地进行民主改革。会议曾决定：一、贯彻以政治争取为主的剿匪方针。发动群众，团结各族人民和一切愿与人民政府合作的社会人士，肃清土匪，安定人心。对胁从群众愿回家生产者，不究既往；主要分子率部投诚者，不杀不辱，从宽处理；愿接受改编者，应积极进行收编和改造。对在回、汉人民中已完全孤立的顽抗股匪和散匪，则选择适当时机剿灭之。对已捕获匪犯的判处，特别是对回族匪犯，应深入了解回、汉群众反映，处理时不可操之过急或判处不当。二、各县开好各族各界代表会议，发扬民族团结精神，传达政策，使各族各界代表能协助政府工作，并应视为团结各族人民群众贯彻政策的主要方法。三、建议各级机关切实吸收、培养回族人士担任工作，党与军事机关注意培养回民干部，并吸收其参加工作，同时教育汉族干部，必须主动地和回族干部亲密团结起来；加强省、县民族委员会，使之成为反映各族人民要求，调处各族间纠纷的机关；建议专署在专员领导下设立包括各民族代表参加的协商委员会。四、建议各地人民法院迅速慎重调处回、汉人民间的纠纷。积压案件经法庭审理时，邀请回、汉代表列席，逐件适当解决，对回、汉、蒙、藏各族人民的互相仇杀，应深入劝导并明令禁止；故意违抗者，在争取当事各族大多数人民同意下，依法惩处。广泛应用和推行回汉人民团结会的方式，启发回汉人民阶级觉悟，适当解决纠纷，加强回汉团结。五、组织各族人民生产救灾工作，积极组织冬季生产，准备春耕。六、办好少数民族干部训练班，把培养大批的少数民族干部，视为做好少数民族工作的关键。七、立即集中整训民兵游击队，清洗地痞流氓。八、立即清理监狱，无条件释放一切情节不严重的人犯和战场俘虏（罪大恶极的反革命分子除外），愿回家者，发给路费。严禁刑讯，违者惩处。九、立即召开各级干部会议，深入传达中共中央西北局扩大会议及中共地委书记会议的精神，在全体干部战士中反复进行民族政策的教育。甘肃各分区地委书记会议并决定以下三事：一、除领导骚乱的首要反动分子之枪支必须收缴外，各族民间枪支包括一般地主富农在内，一律不收，亦不登记；待发动群众以后，转为群众自卫武装。二、待回、汉群众政治觉悟提高，具备民族团结的思想基础，并均有正当的武装自卫要求时，再组织民兵。三、目前应集中力量打击首要反动分子（即各族内部的人民公敌），以实现民族团结，安定地方秩序，不过早反对恶霸。
    两个月来认真改进团结了各族人民
    近两月来，临夏分区领导机关根据上述指示，首先要求所属各县积极培养少数民族干部特别在宁定、和政一带回民居多数的地区更须积极进行。分区领导机关明确规定在回、汉人民杂居地区，按人口比例，配备适当数量的各族干部。迄今该分区业已培养回族和藏族干部二百五十余名，分区一级各机关已配备回民、藏民干部三十一名，并由张乐山（回族）任副专员，各县共有回民正、副县长六名，市长一名，县级科长十一名，县级以上回民干部共四十九名，初步密切了人民政府与回民群众的联系，并发动回、汉群众，订立回汉互助公约，号召互相帮助、互相尊重、互相不发生歧视的言论和报复行为。临夏专署于一月九日至十四日，召集了各县司法裁判员会议，决定今后依据民族团结原则，调解处理民族纠纷，吸收各族人民代表及民族事务委员会人员参加，严禁使用肉刑，以教育改造为原则。同时，由于认真执行了以政治争取为主的剿匪方针，积极通过一切社会力量进行剿匪工作的结果，和政、临夏两县陆续登记的土匪已有四、五百人，大股土匪亦随之纷纷投降。在一月间，原活动于宁定、临夏地区的大股土匪头子马保刻已派遣代表请降。一月十四日匪首马学良、孙少爷等率匪部百余人携带武器向人民政府投降。十五日，匪部头目四十余人及匪首尤高山率匪部百余人，向人民政府投降，并缴出武器、骡马等。另有马八娃匪部马五（伪团长）于一月十七日率部四十余人投降。现临夏分区境内大股土匪已基本肃清（只剩马八娃一股）。驻在宁定的解放军某团，为发动群众，彻底肃清土匪、特务，已抽调干部三十五人，于一月十三日组成两个武工队，配合宁定县干部，于十八日分头出发开展地方工作。甘肃省人民政府亦抽调干部二十人组织工作团，已于一月十八日赴临夏分区帮助工作。该分区专署于一月十八日召开扩大政务会议，着重讨论了结合调解回、汉纠纷，以进行生产救灾工作会议决定发动灾民，尽量利用亲戚朋友关系，互助互济，活跃农村借贷，并保证有借有还和不因放账而加重负担；此外，特别动员殷实富户，捐款救济灾民。会上并决定成立分区以上各级生产救灾委员会。现在该项工作已逐步展开。最近甘肃省人民政府又特拨急赈款人民币一亿元、籽种一千石，以工代赈，作为该分区生产救灾之用；同时，并颁发了生产救灾指示，要求该分区所属各级人民政府，正确宣传民族政策，发动难民回家生产。至二月十五日，原逃赴临夏市的一万多户难民，已有百分之五十回家生产；其余亦正在人民政府帮助下陆续迁回。
