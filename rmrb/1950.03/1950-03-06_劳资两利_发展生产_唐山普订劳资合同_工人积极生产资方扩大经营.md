　　Labor-Capital Both Benefit, Develop Production
    Tangshan Universally Orders Labor-Capital Contracts
    Workers Actively Produce, Capitalists Expand Operations
    [Report from this newspaper] In Tangshan, 43% of industries have signed or are brewing to sign labor-capital collective contracts. In industries where contracts have been signed, labor-capital relations have become normal, and production has rapidly increased. Since the city signed labor-capital collective contracts in October last year, as of January this year, four industries, including ceramics, bathhouses, machine iron, and cast iron, have formally signed contracts and been approved by the Municipal Labor Bureau; both parties have reached agreements in nine industries but have not yet formally signed and approved; and thirteen industries are brewing or in the process of negotiating. Before signing the contract, each industry went through vigorous publicity and a relatively long period of brewing, with labor and capital separately and repeatedly discussing and drafting the draft. Under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, both parties reached an agreement after careful study and enthusiastic discussion, and formally signed it for approval.
    After the collective contract was signed, labor-capital relations have improved. Capitalists, due to a more correct understanding of developing production, have now begun to expand operations. Guanghecheng has added electric rollers and built ten factory buildings. De Shunlong factory is also planning to expand capital and study improvements to equipment. After the workers signed the collective contract, their production enthusiasm increased, they consciously abide by labor discipline, and encourage each other to be on time for work and not to be absent from work without reason. According to preliminary statistics, all industries that have signed contracts have generally increased productivity by about 20%. Since the signing of the contract by the Zhongfu Factory of the Machine Iron Factory, the average output has increased by 36% compared to before. In the past, it took seven to nine workers to build a cotton gin, now it only takes four. For example, in the Yisheng Iron Factory of the Machine Iron Industry, labor-capital relations were not good in the past. After signing the contract, the capitalist took the initiative to discuss and study ways to improve production with the workers, absorb the workers' opinions, and everyone was very enthusiastic, and the production volume has increased compared to before. The Ruixing Bathhouse collapsed, but with the help of the staff, it was quickly repaired and opened, and the living problems of both labor and capital were guaranteed.
    According to the experience of Tangshan City in signing labor-capital collective contracts, attention should be paid to the following issues: 1. First, grasp the focus of labor-capital disputes. What the capitalists are arguing about are issues of rights, wages, dismissal, and shop guarantees in commerce; what the workers are arguing about are issues of wages and benefits. Capitalists are afraid that workers will settle accounts from the past, and labor is afraid that capitalists will reduce business and dismiss employees. These concerns must be reasonably resolved in the spirit of mutual benefit for labor and capital. 2. In the process of signing the contract, the most difficult issue is wages. The important link in solving the problem lies in precisely calculating costs and understanding the capitalists' income and expenditure budget. Only in this way can both parties be persuaded to seek a reasonable solution based on the current situation. 3. When leading the signing of the contract, one should be familiar with the business conditions, general operating rules (slack and busy months), and development prospects of each industry, and help both labor and capital to brew plans and open up their thinking. After the contract is signed, the implementation must be checked regularly, and problems must be solved in a timely manner. 4. To sign a collective contract, it is necessary to grasp the center of each industry, and first focus on solving several major current problems to promote the recovery and development of production. Attempting to sign a comprehensive long-term collective contract all at once is difficult and easily becomes a formality. Not only can it not bring labor-capital relations back to normal, but it can also cause new disputes between labor and capital.

### 劳资两利·发展生产  唐山普订劳资合同  工人积极生产资方扩大经营

　　劳资两利·发展生产
    唐山普订劳资合同
    工人积极生产资方扩大经营
    【本报讯】唐山市百分之四十三的行业，已经签订或正在酝酿订立劳资集体合同。凡已签订合同的行业，劳资关系已趋正常，生产迅速提高。该市自去年十月签订劳资集体合同以来，截至今年一月，已正式签订并经市劳动局批准的，有陶瓷、浴业、机铁、铸铁等四行业；双方已获协议，尚未正式签字批准的有九行业；正在酝酿或协议中的有十三行业。各行业在订立合同之前，都经过大力宣传和较长时间的酝酿，由劳资双方分别反复研讨拟成草案。在劳资两利的原则下，双方经过认真研究和热烈讨论始达成协议，并正式签字，呈请批准。
    集体合同签订后，劳资关系已有改善。资方由于对发展生产有了比较正确的认识，现已开始扩大经营。广和成已增装电滚，并修建厂房十间。德顺隆厂方也正在筹划扩大资金，研究改善设备。工人在订立集体合同后，生产情绪提高自觉遵守劳动纪律，并互相勉励准时上班，不得无故旷工。据初步统计，已签订合同的各行业，一般均已提高生产率百分之二十左右。机铁厂中孚工厂自签订合同后，产量平均较前增加百分之三十六。过去造一架轧花机要用七个到九个工，现在只用四个工。如机铁业义盛铁工厂，过去劳资关系不好，订合同后，资方主动与工友们讨论研究提高生产的办法，吸收工友们的意见，大家情绪很高，生产量已较前提高。瑞兴浴池房屋倒塌了，在职工帮助下，很快修复开张，劳资双方的生活问题均得保无虞。
    根据唐山市订立劳资集体合同的经验，应注意掌握如下几个问题：一、首先掌握劳资争论的焦点。资方争论的是权利、工资、解雇问题及商业中的铺保问题；劳方争论的是工资、福利问题。资本家怕工人清算过去，劳方怕资方缩小营业解雇。这些顾虑，都必须根据劳资两利的精神，给予合理解决。二、在订立合同中，最感困难的是工资问题。解决问题的重要环节，在于精密计算成本与了解资方收支概算。只有如此，才会说服双方，根据当前情况，求得合理解决。三、领导签订合同当时，应熟悉各该行业的营业情况，一般经营规律（困月旺月）及发展前途，并帮助劳资双方酝酿计划与打通思想。合同既经签订，还得经常检查执行情况，发现问题，及时加以解决。四、订立集体合同，必须掌握每个行业的中心，首先抓住解决几个当前的主要问题，以促进生产的恢复与发展。企图一下就订立一个包罗万象的长期集体合同是有困难的，这样容易流于形式。不但不能使劳资关系走上正常，反而会引起劳资间新的争议。
