　　Bo, Bao Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Learning from Soviet Experience to Carry Out Spring Planting
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] A comprehensive TASS Polish News Agency report: Agricultural production cooperatives in Poland have recently increased dramatically. A year ago, Poland had only 40 production cooperatives. On January 1st of this year, there were 243, and now they have developed into 698. In the first ten days of March alone, 126 new cooperatives were organized. The new cooperatives include nearly 100% of the population of their respective villages.

    The cooperatives are actively preparing for spring planting, and state-owned machinery and tractor stations will provide strong assistance. According to the plan, 80% of the traction power needed by the cooperatives will be supplied by machinery and tractor stations. Seventy-eight machinery and tractor stations located in 68 districts will participate in the spring cultivation work.

    A Warsaw newspaper commented that the reason for this amazing development is the good demonstration effect of the first batch of cooperatives, the acceptance of the Soviet collective farming experience, the increased political activism of small and middle peasants, the increasing effectiveness of material supply, loans, the organization of machinery stations, and the result of the state's correct tax policy. By the end of this year, the number of cooperatives will increase to 2,000. With the development of the quality of cooperative work, their organizational effectiveness and economic strength will continue to improve.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] TASS Sofia, 22nd: Bulgaria's 1,605 agricultural production cooperatives have now begun spring plowing. These cooperatives unite 161,000 peasant households. Many cooperatives have successfully used Soviet agricultural techniques, such as planting potatoes in the summer according to the methods of the famous Soviet agronomist Lysenko, which has increased potato yields several times; and planting Soviet sunflower seeds and adopting the spring planting method for wheat, and so on. Now, Bulgaria's sown area has greatly increased. The area for planting crops has been expanded by 200,000 hectares, and the planting of cotton, hemp, and flax has more than doubled.

　　波、保农业生产合作社
    学习苏联经验进行春耕
    【新华社二十六日讯】综合塔斯社波兰通讯社讯：波兰的农业生产合作社近来急剧增加，一年以前波兰只有四十个生产合作社，今年一月一日，有了二四三个，到现在则已发展成六九八个，仅三月份的头十天内即组织起了一二六个新的合作社。新的合作社包括各该村庄人口将近百分之百。
    合作社正积极准备春播，国营机器与拖拉机站将大力予以帮助。按照计划，合作社所需牵引力的百分之八十，将由机器与拖拉机站供应。设于六十八个区里的七十八个机器与拖拉机站，将参加春季的耕种工作。
    华沙报评论称：这种惊人发展的原因，是第一批合作社起了良好的示范作用，接受了苏联集体耕作的经验，小农与中农的政治积极性的提高，物质供应、贷款、机器站的组织愈来愈发挥效力和国家正确的税收政策的结果。到今年年底，合作社将增加到两千个。随着合作社工作质量的发展，它们的组织效力与经济力量也将继续改善。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社索非亚二十二日讯：保加利亚一千六百零五个农业生产合作社现已开始春耕，这些合作社团结了十六万一千户农民。许多合作社已成功地利用了苏联农业的技术，如按照苏联著名农学家李森科的方法在夏天种植马铃薯，使马铃薯的收获量增加了几倍；又如栽种苏联种的向日葵和采用小麦春莳法等等。现在，保加利亚的播种面积，已大量增加。栽种农作物的地区扩大了二十万公顷，棉花、大麻和亚麻的种植增加一倍以上。
