　　Why Unify National Financial and Economic Work
    The State Council of the Central People's Government made a decision on unifying national financial and economic work on March 3rd. This decision is an extremely important measure for improving financial and economic management. There is a reason why this decision was made neither too early nor too late.

    Our wartime financial and economic work was decentralized for twelve years, starting from the War of Resistance Against Japan until December 1949. This can be divided into two segments: the eleven years from 1937 to 1948 as one segment, and 1949 as another. We are now beginning a new period. During the first eleven years, the financial and economic work of each liberated area was completely decentralized, with each having its own currency and managing its own revenue and expenditure. The only unified aspect was the policy. Only in the last year or two was it possible to allocate a small amount of military supplies and materials between the liberated areas. This policy of complete decentralization was adapted to the situation at the time when the liberated areas were divided, and therefore achieved great success. Last year, the victory of the Liberation War rapidly expanded. Within a year, except for Tibet, the entire mainland of China was liberated, and the whole country became a liberated area. To adapt to this situation, the scope and degree of unification in financial and economic work also increased accordingly. First of all, except for the Northeast, the Renminbi has become the national currency, so the expenditure organs have been unified. After the liberation of Shanghai and Wuhan, it was no longer sufficient to have only policy unification like in the first segment. The financial and economic organs across the country unanimously requested that unified regulations, plans, and management be made for the following items: tariffs, tax items, tax rates; production plans, raw material sources, and product sales of state-owned factories; procurement of goods for export, distribution of foreign exchange use, allocation of trade materials in the interior, price management; reasonable use of railways and ships, fee management of post and telecommunications, and so on. All of these needed to be unified, and they have been unified successively. However, as far as the entirety of financial and economic work is concerned, it is still basically decentralized, because there are no unified management methods for fiscal revenue; only expenditure is unified, not revenue. This situation was unavoidable at the time: on the one hand, because the process of expanding the liberated areas was extremely rapid, the financial revenue and expenditure of the newly liberated areas could only be handled by the local takeover organs themselves; on the other hand, the autumn grain levy, which is the main part of the national fiscal revenue, was only collected in most of the new areas in January and February of this year, and has not yet been fully collected in many places. The tax revenue consolidation in the newly liberated areas was also not very fast. Therefore, the situation last year was: continued decentralized operation, but the degree of unification in the decentralized operation increased rapidly and significantly. Now we have reached a new period. Most of the public grain has been collected; unified tariffs, tax items, and tax rates have been announced; because the mainland has been liberated, tax revenue is also higher than last year. The question before us is: should we continue to stay at the stage of last year? Or should we move forward? The result of the national financial conference discussion, the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China answered: it is to move forward, not to stay. That is to say, financial and economic work should move from basically decentralized operation to basically unified management. In other words, although there are still components of decentralized operation, the main thing will be unified management. This change is adapted to the current situation of unification in terms of region, transportation, material exchange, currency system, etc.

    What exactly are the things that are unified under unified management? This has been specifically stipulated in the decision of the State Council. The main content is to unify fiscal revenue and expenditure, with the focus on fiscal revenue. That is, the main revenue of the state, such as public grain, tax revenue, and all warehouse materials, part of the profits and depreciation of public enterprises, are all under the unified control of the state treasury. Without the payment order of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, it cannot be disbursed. This ensures the unified use of state revenue. In terms of fiscal expenditure, it is stipulated that: the supply of the army is unified under the Logistics Department of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, and government organs, schools, and organizations shall formulate establishments, stipulate supply standards, and the extra-establishment and surplus personnel shall be uniformly allocated by the National Establishment Committee; no new personnel shall be recruited without allocation approval. Organs, schools, and factories and enterprises must stipulate the number of staff and the amount of work for each person according to work and production conditions, and everything that can be saved and should be postponed should be saved and postponed. Oppose starting everything at once. Concentrate financial resources on militarily eliminating the remaining enemies and economically focusing on recovery. In addition, the use and allocation of funds and materials of national state-owned trading organs throughout the country are concentrated in the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, and all cash of military and government organs, schools, organizations, and public enterprises, except for a certain amount for recent use, shall be deposited in the National Bank. All of these are the main contents of unified management. These unifications are indispensable today. If national revenue is not used in a unified way, if national expenditure is not paid according to a unified system and under the principle of saving, and if existing funds are not used in a centralized way, the consequences will inevitably be waste of financial resources and inflation. This will not only be harmful to the supply of war and military and political personnel, but also harmful to the national economy and the people's lives.

    Undoubtedly, the unified management of the above content is fundamentally different from the basically decentralized operation of last year. If you ask: After unified management, what are the still existing decentralized operations? The answer is: quite a few. For example: the people's agricultural production must be specifically organized and led by the local government after the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has stipulated the general principles; a part of the national factories are completely assigned to the local and military organs for management, and another part belonging to the Central People's Government is also temporarily entrusted to the local government or military organs for management; in terms of fiscal revenue, local surcharges and purely local taxes are still under local control; according to tariffs, tax items, and tax rates, after the state stipulates the figures for the collection of public grain and tax revenue, the local government works hard under strict compliance with the law, and the tax revenue obtained from strictly investigating tax evasion is mostly returned to the local government in the form of sharing. At the same time, most importantly, the so-called unified management of national financial and economic work does not mean that because public grain and tax revenue belong to the state treasury, the local government does not need to or should not care about the collection, storage, and transportation work, as well as the enterprises scattered throughout the country that belong to the various ministries of the Central People's Government. On the contrary, the local government bears full responsibility for the collection, storage, and transportation of grain and taxes. It is responsible for guiding, assisting, and supervising the local enterprises under the central government to complete the business plans given by the central government's competent departments. Without the work of the local government in this regard, it will be impossible for the local enterprises and organs under the central government to complete their business plans. In addition, in order to enable the Northeast Administrative Region to better support the country financially and economically, the Central People's Government has decided that the currency of the Northeast will also temporarily maintain its current status, and in terms of finance, it will only adopt the method of transferring materials to the Northeast temporarily.

    Is it too early to implement such unified management in a country like ours with a vast area and many places that have only recently been liberated? Is it difficult? Compared with the progress of the financial and economic work within a liberated area from decentralization to unification during the period when the liberated areas were divided in the past, implementing unified management of financial and economic work at present is indeed an earlier advance in progress. However, the difficulties arising from this are not too great. Because except for the provinces in the border areas with very inconvenient transportation, such as Xinjiang and future Tibet, which should still be treated as exceptions, wired and wireless telegraph and telephone lines throughout the country have been unblocked, and telegrams can be sent back and forth in a few hours, and questions can be answered by telephone in a few minutes. The railway has been fully restored, and air navigation will also begin. Now the various ministries of the Central People's Government have been able to receive daily reports on business conditions and revenue and expenditure figures from all over the country. That is to say, it is no longer a divided rural liberated area, the whole country has been unified, and all advanced transportation and communication tools have been mastered by the people. The difficulties of the past no longer exist today. Therefore, it is now possible to unify earlier. We should not focus on the small difficulties in the work of unified management and cause great difficulties in the national economy and the people's lives. We should overcome small difficulties to avoid great difficulties.

    Is there too little local flexibility with this degree of unification? Yes, local flexibility has been greatly reduced compared to before. But we know that the country's fiscal revenue and expenditure are not only not rich at present, but also have deficits, and there is very little cash and materials that can be flexibly used. If this small mobile force is not placed in the hands of the Central People's Government, but distributed to local governments at all levels across the country, the consequence will inevitably be the loss of this small mobile force. This is just like in combat. If the mobile forces are dispersed, either a major defeat will be suffered, or it will be difficult to achieve a complete victory. Allowing flexibility at all levels will inevitably lead to no flexibility in the overall situation, and no flexibility for everyone.

    Will unified management reduce the enthusiasm of lower-level organizations? Possibly, but it should be avoided. After the unified management of financial and economic work, the reason for the decline in the enthusiasm of lower-level staff is generally due to a misunderstanding, that is, thinking that since the higher authorities have unified management, the lower levels do not need to be responsible. Therefore, the responsibility of the leading organs is to tell these comrades that lower-level comrades still have great responsibilities in unified management. Whether anything is done well or badly by the state is closely related to oneself. "If it doesn't concern you, hang it up high." is completely wrong.

    After the public grain is taken away, the funds issued each month are in cash Renminbi. If the currency depreciates, how can the lower-level funds be maintained? Don't worry! First, one of the direct effects of unifying national financial and economic work is to prevent inflation. Second, some public grain will still be issued as funds to some places in the future. Third, even if the currency depreciates, the State Council's decision also stipulates that the National Bank will conduct real-value deposits for all military and government departments and public enterprises, which basically guarantees the currency value of various funds.

    The lower-level funds will always be issued, so why should the tax revenue be returned to the state treasury first and then issued the funds? If the lower levels are allowed to use the funds from the tax revenue first, isn't it the same to hand over the surplus? Experience tells us: the results of these two methods are different. When implementing the method of "handing over the surplus", local financial organs often have to take care of "local needs" first, which is convenient for misappropriation, and the result is that there is very little "handing over", or even no handing over. Many items of "local needs", in the eyes of the local, are primary, but from the overall perspective, they are often secondary and can be postponed. If the whole country spends funds according to the needs of each local area, then where will the money come from to handle national affairs? The allocation of a family's income must also distinguish between priorities, let alone the country? In the People's Government, the standard for whether public officials are qualified in handling financial and economic issues is not only corruption or integrity; corruption is a crime, and integrity is necessary. The main standard is whether there is waste. This waste does not only refer to the waste of extravagance and abuse, but especially refers to the waste of not distinguishing between the priorities of the whole and the parts in spending money on handling affairs, that is, not using funds most appropriately on the most important things, but inappropriately using them on unimportant things. After the local government hands over the grain and tax revenue, the central government must guarantee the local funds. But it should be said that it is difficult to completely avoid the situation of accidentally delaying the issuance of funds for ten days or half a month. We are still in wartime, and the principle of "first the front, then the rear, first the army, then the local" is still the basic principle of our financial payment. Even if the funds are delayed for ten days or half a month, will the lower-level government personnel starve to death? The guerrilla warfare period of fighting day and night has been survived, and the period of secret work under the rule of the enemy with no food and clothing has been survived. Now the whole country has been liberated and the supply of food has been guaranteed. Can accidentally delaying the funds for ten days or half a month starve people to death?

    In the initial stage of unified management, the lower levels have difficulties. But, comrades! These difficulties are much smaller and the consequences are much lighter than the difficulties caused by the continued lack of unified national financial and economic management, which leads to great chaos in finance and prices. We must endure small difficulties to avoid great difficulties. We must abide by the principle: the part obeys the whole, and the local obeys the central.

    As long as we strictly implement the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work and endure a few months of difficulties, we have good reason to hope that the financial situation will improve. The good or bad of the financial situation is directly related to the national economy and the people's lives. Unifying national financial and economic work will not only overcome today's financial difficulties, but also create the necessary preconditions for post-war economic construction without missing the opportunity. If fiscal revenue is not managed in a unified way, it will not be possible to concentrate the country's funds, and therefore it will be impossible to concentrate use. This is harmful at present and will also be harmful in the future.

### 为什么要统一国家财政经济工作

　　为什么要统一国家财政经济工作
    中央人民政府政务院在三月三日作了关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定。这个决定，对改进财政经济的管理是一个极其重要的措施。不早不迟，作出这个决定是有原因的。
    我们的战时财经工作从抗日战争开始直至一九四九年的十二年间都是分散经营的。其中又分两个段落：一九三七年至一九四八年的十一年是一个段落，一九四九年又是一个段落。目前正开始新的时期。头十一年各解放区间的财经工作，完全分散经营，各有货币，各管收支，统一的方面只有一项，即是政策统一。仅仅最后一二年在解放区之间才有可能作少数军用品和物资的调拨。这种完全分散经营的政策，是适应当时解放区被分割的情况的，因此获得了极大成绩。去年一年，解放战争的胜利迅速扩大，一年之间，除西藏外，全国大陆全部解放，全国都成了解放区。适应这种情况，财经工作上统一的范围和程度也随之增加。首先，除东北外，人民币已成为全国的通货，因此支出的机关统一了。在上海、武汉解放之后，像第一段落那样仅限于政策上的统一，已经不够。全国各地财经机关一致要求对下列各项问题作出统一的规定、计划和管理。这些项目是：税则、税目、税率；国营工厂的生产计划、原料来源，产品推销；外销物资的采购，外汇使用的分配，内地贸易物资的调拨，物价管理；铁道、轮船的合理使用，邮电的收费管理等等。所有这些，都需要统一，而且都陆续地统一了。但就财经工作的全部说来，基本上仍是分散经营的，因为财政的收入并未规定统一管理的办法，只统一支出，未统一收入。这种情况在当时是不可避免的：一方面，因为解放区扩大的过程极其迅速，新解放地区的财政收支，又只能由各地接管机关自行处理；另一方面，作为国家财政收入主要部分的秋征公粮，大部新区只在今年一二月才收起，不少地方尚未收齐，新解放区的税收整理也不是很快的。所以去年一年的情况是：继续分散经营，但分散经营中的统一的程度，迅速大量地增加。目前到了新的时期。公粮大部已征收起；统一的税则、税目、税率已经公布；因为大陆已解放，税收也比去年多。放在面前的问题是：继续停留在去年那个阶段上呢？还是前进呢？全国财政会议讨论的结果，中央人民政府政务院的决定和中共中央的决议答复说：是前进，不是停留。就是说，财经工作要从基本上分散经营前进到基本上统一管理。也就是说，虽然分散经营的成份仍然有，但主要的将是统一管理。这种改变是适应目前在地域、交通、物资交流、关内币制等等方面已经统一的情况的。
    究竟统一管理那几件事？这在政务院决定中已经具体规定。主要内容是统一财政收支，重点在财政收入。即国家的主要收入，如公粮、税收及仓库物资的全部，公营企业的利润和折旧金的一部分，统归国库。不经中央人民政府财政部的支付命令，不能动支。这样，就保证了国家收入的统一使用。在财政支出方面，则规定：军队供给统一于人民解放军总司令部的后勤部，政府机关、学校、团体则制定编制，规定供给标准，编外和编余人员由全国编制委员会统一调配；不经调配批准，不得自招新的人员。机关、学校与工厂企业，按照工作和生产情况，均须规定工作人员数量和每个人员的工作额，一切可省和应该缓办者，统统节省和缓办，反对百废俱举。集中财力于军事上消灭残敌，经济上重点恢复。此外，全国国营贸易机关资金物资的运用调拨，集中于中央人民政府贸易部，一切军政机关、学校、团体和公营企业的现金，除留若干近期使用者外，一律存入国家银行。所有这些，是统一管理的主要内容。这些统一在今天已经必不可少。如果国家收入不作统一使用，如果国家支出不按统一制度并在节省原则下支付，如果现有资金不加集中使用，则后果必然是浪费财力，通货膨胀。这就不但有害于战争和军政人员的供应，而且有害于国家经济和人民生活。
    毫无疑问，上述内容的统一管理，比之去年的基本上分散经营有根本的区别。如果问：在统一管理之后，那些是仍然存在的分散经营？回答是：还很不少。例如：人民的农业生产，在中央人民政府农业部规定了总的方针之后，必需由地方政府担任具体的组织和领导；国家工厂的一部分完全划归地方和军事机关管理，另一部分属于中央人民政府所有的，也暂时委托地方政府或军事机关管理；财政收入上，地方附加粮和纯属地方税，仍归地方支配；依据税则、税目、税率，国家规定了征收公粮、税收数字后，地方政府在严遵法令之下努力工作，从严查漏税中得来的税收，则以分成办法，大部归地方。同时，最重要的，所谓国家财政经济工作的统一管理，绝不是说，因为公粮、税收归了国库，因此，关于征收、保管、运输工作以及散在各地的中央人民政府各部所属的企业，地方政府不必或不应过问。相反的，地方政府对粮、税的征收、保管、运输，负有全部责任。对当地的中央所属各企业，完成中央人民政府主管各部所给业务计划，则负有指导、协助、监督的责任。没有地方政府这方面的工作，中央所属各地企业机关的完成业务计划将是不可能的。此外，为使东北行政区能更好地在财政经济上支援全国起见，中央人民政府决定东北的货币也暂时维持现状，在财政上对东北也暂时只采取抽调物资的办法。
    像我们这样地区广大，许多地方又解放不久的国家，实行这样统一管理，是否太早？是否困难？比之过去各解放区被分割时期，一个解放区内部财经工作由分散进到统一的那种进度来看，在目前实行财经工作的统一管理，确是在进度上提早了。但是由此而来的困难并不算大。因为除边疆上交通十分不便的省份，如新疆和将来的西藏，仍应例外处理外，全国各地有线无线电报电话，已经畅通，几小时内，可以电报往复，几分钟内可以电话问答。铁路已经全部恢复，空航也将开始。现在中央人民政府各部，已经可能做到逐日收到各地业务情况和收支数字的报告。这就是说，现在不是被分割的农村解放区，全国已经统一了，一切进步的交通、通讯工具已由人民掌握，过去那样的困难，今天已经不存在了。因此，提早统一，已有可能。我们不应偏顾统一管理上工作方面的小困难，而造成国家经济和人民生活的大困难。应该克服小困难，以避免大困难。
    这样程度的统一，地方机动性是否太少？是的，地方机动性比前大大减少了。但是我们知道目前国家的财政收支非但不富裕，而且有赤字，可以机动使用的现金物资本来很少。这微小的机动力量，如果不放在中央人民政府手里，而分散给全国各级地方政府，其后果必然是把这微小的机动力量，丧失无余。这正像作战一样，把机动兵力分散了，不是大吃败仗，就是难获全胜。允许层层级级机动，必然是全局不机动，大家不机动。
    统一管理了，是否会降低下级组织的积极性？可能的，但是应该避免。财经工作统一管理之后，下级工作人员降低积极性的原因，大体由于一种误解，即以为上面统一管理了，下级可以不必负责。因此，领导机关的责任，就是应该告诉这些同志，统一管理中下级同志仍负有极大的责任。国家任何事情，办得好、办得坏，都与自己有密切关系。“事不关己，高高挂起。”是完全错误的。
    把公粮提走，每个月发的经费是现金人民币，货币跌了价，下级经费怎样维持？不必担心！第一，统一国家财政经济工作的直接效用之一，就在防止通货膨胀。第二，对于若干地方，今后仍发一部分公粮作为经费。第三，即令货币跌了价，政务院决定中也规定了国家银行对一切军政部门及公营企业举办折实存款，这就基本上保证了各种经费的币值。
    下级的经费总是要发的，何必将税收先归国库再发经费？如果先让下面在税款中把经费支用了，多余的上缴不一样吗？经验回答我们：这两种办法的结果是不一样的。在实行“多余的上缴”的办法时，地方财政机关常常要首先照顾“当地需要”，近水楼台，便于挪用，结果是“上缴”无几，甚至不缴。“当地需要”的许多项目，在当地看来，是首要，但从全局看来，常是次要的，可以缓办的。全国如果都按各个局部需要来开支经费，那末，那有钱来办全国性的大事？一个家庭收入的支配，还要分清轻重缓急，何况国家？在人民政府中，公务人员在处理财经问题上合格与否的标准，不单是贪污或廉洁；贪污是犯罪，廉洁是必需的。主要的标准，还在于是否浪费。这种浪费，也不单指铺张滥用的那种浪费，而特别是指办事用钱不分轻重缓急全体局部的那种浪费，即是说，不是把经费最适当地使用在一些最重要的事情上，而是不适当地使用在一些不重要的事情上。地方把粮税收入交出之后，中央对地方经费是必须保证的。但应该说，偶然迟发十天半月的情况，难于完全避免。目前仍在战时，先前方，后后方，先军队，后地方，仍旧是我们财政支付的基本原则。即使经费迟发了十天半月，难道下级政府人员就会饿死？日夜作战的游击战争时期熬过了，敌人统治下衣食无着的秘密工作时期熬过了，现在全国解放，保证了吃粮，偶然迟发十天半月的经费，难道就能饿死人？
    统一管理的初期，下级是有困难的。但是，同志们！这种困难比之因全国财经管理继续不统一而致金融物价大乱所产生的困难，其程度要小得多，其后果要轻得多。我们必须忍受小困难，避免大困难。我们必须遵守这样的原则：部分服从全体，地方服从中央。
    只要我们严格实行政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，熬过几个月的困难，我们很有理由，希望财政情况达到好转。财政情况的好坏，直接关联到国家经济和人民生活。统一国家财经工作，将不仅克服今天的财政困难，也为战后的经济建设不失时机地创造必要的前提。如果财政收入不作统一管理，决不能集中国家的资金，因此也就说不上集中使用。这在现时有害，将来也有害。
