Some Knowledge of Vegetable Growing
——Reference for Secondary School Students' After-School Production Plan
Wu Yingji

I visited several vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, and they gave me the following instructions regarding some knowledge of vegetable growing:

(1) Seasonality of Vegetable Growing. Generally speaking, vegetable growing is divided into three periods:

From the middle of the second month to the end of the third month of the lunar calendar is the first period, in which you can plant Chinese cabbage, spinach (at the latest by mid-March), small red radishes, and chives.

From the beginning of the fourth month to the middle of the sixth month of the lunar calendar is the second period, in which you can plant tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, etc.

From the end of June to the end of September is the third period, in which you can plant Chinese cabbage and white radishes.

Missing the season will reduce the harvest once and cause a great loss. The most important of the three periods is the third period, because Chinese cabbage is the most important harvest in the vegetable garden.

(2) Estimated yields of several main vegetables (per mu, calculated with 50 rows):

(1) Chinese cabbage yields 80-100 jin per row, and each mu can yield 4,000-5,000 jin per season.

(2) Spinach yields 40-50 jin per row, and each mu can yield 2,000-2,500 jin per season.

(3) Small radishes yield 25,000-37,500 per mu per season.

(4) Chives can be harvested six or seven times from now until the eighth month of the lunar calendar, and each mu can yield at least 15,000 jin.

(5) Tomatoes have 30 plants per row, each plant yields an average of 6 jin, and each mu can yield 9,000 jin per season. If Chinese cabbage is planted in time, 6,000 jin can be produced.

(6) Eggplants have 24 plants per row, each plant yields an average of 3, and each mu can yield 3,600 per season.

(7) Cucumbers have 50 seedlings per row, each seedling yields 4-5, and each mu can yield 10,000-12,000.

(8) Chinese cabbage can yield 4,000-5,000 jin per mu.

(9) Cabbage yields about 4,800 jin per mu.

(10) Winter melon can yield 1,200-2,400 per mu.

(11) Pumpkins can be planted incidentally on the edge of the field.

(3) Pay attention to crop rotation: Some vegetables must be rotated. For example, if a piece of land is planted with chives, it must be planted again after five years; eggplants must be planted after three years; cucumbers can be planted every year. If you skip one year, you must skip five years. Therefore, you need to consult the original users of the land to find out what should be planted on the land this year.

(4) Seed and seedling raising: Chive and scallion seeds cannot be used after three years, radish seeds are better when they are new, Chinese cabbage seeds can be used within ten years, and spinach seeds are better the older they are. Seeds are also divided into "kouzi" (good) and "fuzi" (bad), chives and radishes are better when they are "kouzi". Moreover, the preservation of seeds is very important. If they get damp or are exposed to smoke, they cannot be used. Therefore, you should pay special attention when buying seeds, and it is best to order them from agricultural experimental institutions or farms.

Eggplants, tomatoes, cucumbers, and winter melons need to be raised as seedlings. In the long run, it is cheaper to raise your own seedlings, but the first year of raising seedlings requires making straw curtains, hiring workers, and buying seeds, which costs too much, almost three times the cost of buying seedlings. Therefore, schools should negotiate with farms to buy seedlings this year, and then make straw curtains and store seeds in the fall to prepare for raising their own seedlings next year.

(5) Fertilizer: Human manure, cattle and horse manure, and compost made from tree leaves and weeds can all be used. Vegetables in the first and second periods require about 1,500 jin of fertilizer per mu, and the third period requires about 2,000 jin. Manure must be fermented before it can be used, but raw manure can also be used when the weather is not too hot now. Vegetables that can be fertilized with raw manure include chives, cucumbers, winter melons, eggplants, etc. Chinese cabbage can be used after autumn when the weather is cool; spinach, Chinese cabbage, and small radishes cannot be fertilized with raw manure. Schools should hurry up and make fermented fertilizer, and it is best not to buy manure, as the manure you buy is often mixed with half or even two-thirds of soil.

(6) Management efficiency and technician treatment:

(1) One technician can cultivate five mu of garden land. Now hiring a technician costs 200 jin of millet per month, plus board.

(2) One well and one waterwheel can supply water for 20 mu of land. A mule pulling a waterwheel can water three or four mu per day, a donkey can water two or three mu per day, and a human-powered waterwheel, with three people per shift and nine to twelve people, can water four or five mu per day.

(7) Harvest estimate: According to the harvest situation of vegetable gardens in the suburbs of Beijing last year, the yield per mu converted into millet is generally 1,000-1,200 jin, the best is 1,700 jin, and the worst is about 600 jin.

This is just the beginning of our learning from farmers. In actual planting, there are still many problems, and we need to humbly learn from farmers at all times!

　　种菜的几点知识
    ——中学课余生产订计划的参考
    吴英济
    我访问京郊几位种菜农民，对于种菜的一些知识，承他们指示如下：
    （一）种菜的季节性。一般的讲，种菜分为三期：
    从农历二月中旬至三月底为第一期，可以种小白菜，菠菜（最晚到三月中旬），小红萝卜，韭菜。
    从农历四月初至六月中旬为第二期，可种西红柿，茄子，黄瓜等。
    六月下旬至九月下旬为第三期，可种大白菜，白萝卜。
    错过了季节就要减少一次收成，损失很大。三期中最重要的是第三期，因为大白菜是菜园中最主要的收获。
    （二）几种主要蔬菜的估计产量（每亩以五十畦算）：
    （１）小白菜每畦产八○——一○○斤，每亩一季可得四○○○——五○○○斤。
    （２）菠菜每畦产四○——五○斤，每亩一季可产二○○○——二五○○斤。
    （３）小萝卜每亩一季可产二五○○○——三七五○○个。
    （４）韭菜从现在到农历八月，可收割六、七次，每亩最少可产一五○○○斤。
    （５）西红柿每畦三十棵，每棵平均产六斤，每亩一季可得九○○○斤，如赶种白菜，可出六○○○斤，
    （６）茄子每畦二十四棵，每棵平均产三个，每亩一季可得三六○○个。
    （７）黄瓜每畦五十苗，每苗产四、五条，每亩可产一○○○○——一二○○○条。
    （８）大白菜每亩可产四○○○——五○○○斤。
    （９）洋白菜每亩约产四八○○斤。
    （１０）冬瓜每亩可产一二○○——二四○○个。
    （１１）南瓜在地边附带种植即可。
    （三）注意轮栽：有些菜是必须轮栽的，如一块地种了韭菜，要隔五年才能再种，茄子要隔三年，黄瓜则是年年种都可以，如果隔一次，就必须隔五年。这样，今年地上该种什么，需要向原来使用这地的人请教。
    （四）种子和养苗问题：韭菜和葱的种子隔三年就不能用了，萝卜是新种子好，大白菜种子十年以内的都可以用，菠菜子则是年数越多的越好；种子又有口子、伏地子之分，韭菜和萝卜都是口子好；而且种子的保存很重要，如沾了潮或被烟串了，都不能用，所以购买种子时要特别注意，最好是向农业实验机关或农场定购。
    茄子、西红柿、黄瓜和冬瓜是需要养苗的。长期打算是自己养苗便宜，但第一年养苗要制草帘子、请工、买种子，花成本太大，几达买苗用钱的三倍，所以各校今年还是和农场商量买苗好，待秋天以后再制草帘、贮种子，准备明年自己养。
    （五）肥料：人粪、牛马粪及树叶乱草等所制的堆肥，都可以用。第一期和第二期的蔬菜，每亩需肥约一五○○斤，第三期约需二○○○斤。粪肥要发过了才能用，但现在天气不太热的时候，生粪也可以用。蔬菜中可以上生粪的有韭菜、黄瓜、冬瓜、茄子等，大白菜秋后天凉快了可以用；不能上生粪的有菠菜、小白菜、小萝卜。各校应赶紧制造发肥，最好不要买粪，买的粪常常掺到一半甚至三分之二的土。
    （六）管理效能及技工待遇：
    （１）一个技工可种园地五亩。现在雇一个技工每月二○○斤小米并管伙食即可。
    （２）水井一口、水车一架，能供二十亩地浇水。骡子拉水车，一头每日能浇三、四亩，驴子一头每日能浇二、三亩，人力推水车，三个人一班，有九个至十二个人，每日能浇四、五亩。
    （七）收成估计：根据去年京郊菜园的收成情况，每亩产量折合小米，一般的是一○○○——一二○○斤，最好的有一七○○斤，最坏的约六○○斤。
    这只是我们向农民学习的开始。实际种植的时候，问题还多着呢，需要我们时时刻刻虚心地向农民学习！
