　　Unveiling the Veil of "Paradise"
　　Sāng Qián
　　In old world geography textbooks, when discussing Switzerland, after describing the snowy scenery of the Alps and the beautiful scenery of Lake Geneva, it was always added: "Known as the 'World's Paradise'", or even: "It relies on the gathering of tourists to obtain a huge amount of foreign capital income." Under the deception of bourgeois "scholars," Switzerland seemed to be merely a neutral country with super-class geographical characteristics, unrelated to world politics. It wasn't until I read Leontiev's political economy that I uncovered this veil of reality. It tells us: "The bourgeoisie and its countless parasites...consume the products of the hard labor of countless millions of hired slaves, and even entire countries (such as Switzerland)...become places where the international bourgeoisie indulges in extravagance and spends its unearned income." (Page 265)
　　Let's take a look at Swiss society: the rulers, on the one hand, lick the dregs of blood and sweat squeezed by the international bourgeoisie (correctly speaking, mostly monopoly capitalists) from the working people at home and abroad, and on the other hand, they exploit the wealth of the domestic working people by relying on "geographical characteristics"; but the broad masses of the people have to labor and serve the international and domestic monopoly capitalists, and cannot carry out production according to their own will. With such a "paradise" for them to squander and enjoy, naturally the international bourgeoisie does not want it to be destroyed by artillery fire, so the trick of "neutral country" is not difficult to understand.
　　Not long ago, I saw a piece of news saying that Switzerland's national income has sharply decreased recently due to the scarcity of tourists, thus causing panic. This shows that the international capitalist system is taking a turn for the worse, heading towards decline and death, and is not very far from the grave.

　　揭开“乐园”的纱幕
    桑乾
    在旧的世界地理教科书上，当讲到瑞士这个国家的时候，每每在形容了一番阿尔卑斯山的雪景和日内瓦湖的美丽景色后，总会添上一句：“有‘世界乐园’之称”，或者还加上说：“是以游客云集，得赖以收入一笔巨大的外资”。在资产阶级“学者”的蒙蔽下，所看到的瑞士似乎只是一个具有超阶级的地理特点的，与世界政治无关的中立国。一直到我读了列昂捷也夫的政治经济学，才把这层掩盖在实际上的纱幕揭开了。它这样告诉我们：“资产阶级及其无数的寄食者……消费无数百万雇佣奴隶的苦工劳动的产物，甚至整个国家（如瑞士）……都变成国际资产阶级穷奢极华，花费自己不劳动收获的地方。”（二六五页）
    我们看一看瑞士的社会吧：统治者一方面舐着国际资产阶级（正确地说，大部分是垄断资本家）从其国内外劳动人民剥削来血汗的残滴，一方面又凭借“地理特点”榨取国内劳动人民的财富；但广大人民却不得不为国际国内的垄断资本家们劳动服役，而不能依照自己的意志进行生产。有着这样一个供他们挥霍享乐的“乐园”，自然国际资产阶级不愿它毁于炮火，因此“中立国”的把戏也就不难明白了。
    不久前见到一则新闻，说瑞士近来因游客稀少，国家收入锐减，因而引起恐慌。这说明了国际资本主义制度正在走着倒运的路，正在走着衰落和死亡的路，离开坟墓已经不很远了。
