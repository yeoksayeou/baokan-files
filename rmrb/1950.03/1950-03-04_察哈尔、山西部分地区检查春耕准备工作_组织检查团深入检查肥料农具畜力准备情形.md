Chahar and Shanxi Provinces (Partial): Inspection of Spring Plowing Preparations

Inspection Teams Organized to Conduct In-Depth Inspections of Fertilizer, Farm Implement, and Livestock Preparations

[This newspaper dispatch] Chahar and parts of Shanxi provinces are actively inspecting spring plowing preparations. The Chahar Agricultural Department has formed a "Spring Production Work Inspection Team" composed of cadres from relevant departments to go to various special districts and counties to specifically inspect and assist in spring plowing preparations. The Yanbei Special Commissioner's Office of the province also issued instructions on the 14th of last month to cadres at all levels, emphasizing the need to combine production with land reform, the issuance of land certificates, and other work to truly inspect the spring plowing preparations of the masses, and to promptly discover and solve problems. During the process, special use should be made of people's representative conferences at all levels to vigorously publicize production tasks and policies for getting rich, and to improve the productive mood of the masses. Technical improvement education should also be conducted among the masses through inspection. In order to ensure that spring plowing preparation work is carried out in a planned manner, the instructions stipulate: First, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must deepen their operations into the countryside, continue to organize rural blacksmiths and carpenters to prepare farm implements such as plows, shovels, hoes, and seed drills; second, educate the masses to plant a variety of crops and increase production; third, spring plowing labor and livestock should be organized in advance, and attention should be paid to helping and solving the difficulties of impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and disaster victims. At the same time, cadres in special districts, counties, and villages should learn seed soaking and mixing techniques in order to lead the masses to universally soak and mix seeds. The Yuci District Committee and Yuci Special Commissioner's Office of Shanxi Province also dispatched twenty-one cadres on the 21st of last month to form a "Spring Preparation Work Inspection Team," which was divided into five groups to conduct in-depth inspections in counties such as Yuci, Taigu, Qi County, Zuoquan, and Pingding. The content of the inspection mainly focused on checking how well fertilizer preparations have been made in new and old areas, as well as the repair and replacement of farm implements and the organization of labor and livestock. During the inspection, attention should also be paid to discovering and solving problems so that the spring plowing preparation work forms a movement. In addition, Yushe County checked spring plowing preparation work by first using four comparisons within the Party: comparing manure piles, comparing coal piles, comparing firewood piles, and comparing leadership to check the achievements of winter production and spring plowing preparation work. Then, on the basis of the conscious leadership of Party members, a general inspection was carried out. During the inspection, Party member cadres conducted door-to-door visits, and at the same time, through typical inspection and calculation propaganda and education, mobilized the masses for self-examination. This inspection revealed many problems. For example, in Hancun Village, the average amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu in the whole village was 47 dan, reaching 93% of the original fertilizer accumulation plan. However, after checking and visiting households, it was found that some households had exceeded the task of fertilizer accumulation, while some households had not even reached half of the plan. After in-depth inspection in Tancun Village, it was found that eight families of revolutionary martyrs and three elderly and orphaned households had only accumulated three to five dan of fertilizer, and it was also found that many households had problems such as damp seeds and insufficient fuel. After in-depth inspection in the whole county, on the one hand, the complacent mood of cadres and Party members who were satisfied with the average figures and not actively leading production was broken. At the same time, it alerted the leadership to the importance of inspection work. The whole county is now continuing to carry out inspection of spring plowing preparation work in order to be fully prepared and strive for timely spring plowing and sowing.

    察哈尔、山西部分地区检查春耕准备工作
    组织检查团深入检查肥料农具畜力准备情形
    【本报讯】察哈尔、山西等省部分地区正在积极检查春耕准备工作。察哈尔农业厅抽调各有关部门干部组成“春耕生产工作检查团”，赴各专县具体检查帮助春耕准备工作。该省雁北专署也于上月十四日指示所属各级干部，强调要结合生产和土地改革、发土地证等工作，确实检查群众春耕准备情形，及时发现问题与解决问题。进行中要特别利用各级人民代表会，大力宣传生产任务与发家致富政策，提高群众生产情绪。并通过检查在群众中进行改进技术的教育。为使春耕准备工作有计划地进行，该指示规定：第一、各级供销社要把业务深入到农村中去，继续组织农村铁木匠，准备犁、锹、铧、耧等农具；第二、教育群众多种多产作物；第三、春耕的劳畜力要事先组织起来，注意帮助和解决贫苦烈军属和灾民的困难，同时专县区村干部要学会浸种拌种技术，以便领导群众普遍浸种拌种。山西省榆次地委会及榆次专署也于上月二十一日抽调干部二十一人，组成“春耕准备工作检查团”，分五组到榆次、太谷、祁县、左权、平定等县深入检查。其检查内容主要是着重检查新老区肥料准备的如何？以及农具的修补增置、劳畜力的组织情形等。在检查中并要注意发现问题与解决问题，使春耕准备工作形成运动。此外榆社县检查春耕准备工作，首先在党内用比粪堆、比煤堆、比柴堆、比带头的四比方式，进行检查冬产成绩及春耕准备工作，然后在党员领导自觉的基础上进行普遍的检查。检查时党员干部一方面进行挨门挨户的访问；同时通过典型检查计算的宣传教育，发动群众性的自我检查。这样检查发现了许多问题。如该县韩村按全村平均计算每亩已积肥四十七担，已达积肥原计划的百分之九十三，但经过查比访户后，发现有些户积肥已超过了任务，有些户则还不及计划的一半。潭村经过深入检查，查出八户烈军属及三户孤寡户只积肥三、五担，并发现许多户的种籽潮湿燃料不足等现象。全县经过深入检查后，一方面打破了干部党员满足于平均数字不积极领导生产的自满情绪，同时也警惕了领导上对检查工作的重视。现全县正在继续进行检查春耕准备工作，以便准备的充分争取适时春耕下种。
