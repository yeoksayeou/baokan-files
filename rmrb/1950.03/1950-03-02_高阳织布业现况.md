　　Current Status of Gaoyang Weaving Industry
　　Lin Fang, Gao Xuting
　　With the strong support of the public enterprise sector and cooperatives, the Gaoyang weaving industry has rapidly embarked on the road to recovery. Currently, more than 3,000 looms have resumed production, producing 2,500 bolts of cloth per day.

　　The recovery of the Gaoyang weaving industry has gone through some twists and turns. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the public enterprise sector did not fully recognize the historical foundation of the Gaoyang cloth industry and its important position in the local people's economic life. It blindly estimated that "after the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, fine cloth would go to the countryside, and the Gaoyang weaving industry would have little future." Therefore, it almost abandoned leadership and support for it, resulting in a lack of raw materials and a shrinking sales channel. The number of active looms decreased from 3,300 to 1,500 at one point. Later, due to local flooding, the county Economic Committee, under the guidance of the public enterprise sector, conducted a special study on the weaving industry and decided on a policy of vigorous support, which led to the recovery of the weaving industry.

　　First, the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the provincial Jianhua Dyeing and Rolling Mill, and the county supply and marketing cooperative greatly solved the financial difficulties of the masses, collected a large amount of loose yarn and cloth, and paid fixed wages, which enabled 2,200 looms to resume production, playing a decisive role in the recovery of the Gaoyang cloth industry. At the same time, local governments at all levels strengthened the organizational leadership of mass production, so that the tools, funds, and labor of many villages were organized. The joint weaving groups of Dongzhaobu, Fujia Ying, and Liangcun accounted for about two-thirds of the weaving households in the whole village. In Liangcun, the two groups of Meng Chang (Organization Committee Member of the CCP village branch) and Chen Guang (Propaganda Committee Member of the CCP village branch), with 25 households and 18 looms, worked in shifts day and night after the combination of labor and tools, so that the machines never stopped, greatly saving labor. In the past, it was necessary for each household to send one person to Gaoyang to deliver cloth and pick up yarn, a round trip of fifty li. Now, only one person is sent from each group, saving 23 laborers each time. In addition, under the leadership of the CCP branch and party members, many weaving households turned dead assets into living assets, selling furniture, clothes, and other items that were not temporarily needed to purchase looms. Five villages, including Dongzhaobu, added 89 new looms. The masses in Zhaokou Village also helped military families and disaster victims buy four looms, solving the livelihood problems of four military families and eight disaster victims. For households with tools but lacking funds, mutual assistance and mutual borrowing were initiated on the existing basis. Weaving households in various villages that lacked funds generally used more warp threads and less weft threads; when the weft threads were insufficient, they borrowed and returned them from other households as they went, trying their best to keep the machines running.

　　The second is to improve quality and open up sales channels. The Gaoyang weaving industry is a decentralized small-scale production unit in the vast rural areas, relying on intermediate merchants for yarn supply and cloth collection in history. Under the merchants' and employers' heavy exploitation, weavers were often forced to cut corners, resulting in a decline in cloth quality and a gradual decline in sales. Therefore, in the current situation, the main key to restoring the Gaoyang cloth market lies in improving the quality of cloth and opening up sales channels. The representatives of all circles in the county formulated a specific plan for "rectifying villages" for the weaving industry, stipulating four standards for both white cloth and striped cloth, divided into four grades. Each grade specifically stipulates the number of warp and weft threads and the size of length and width, weight, etc. At the same time, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce strengthened market management and commodity inspection, selling each grade of cloth in the same market according to the "rectifying villages" standard, so as to avoid mixing inferior goods with good ones; the Taxation Bureau checked the quality at the same time when issuing shipping permits to merchants, in order to maintain the quality level of finished products. In order to maintain the credit of colored cloth, dyeing households were informed that bleached color and color must be strictly separated, and bleached color must not be used as color. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company purchased all the cloths that met the "rectifying villages" standards in the market. For those that did not meet the standards, in addition to appropriately reducing wages, they were also educated to improve in the future. The Jianhua Factory publicly announced the quality of cloth delivered by "withdrawn machine" households at the end of each month to show encouragement and criticism. The Jianhua Factory and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company made and affixed trademark numbers according to the types of cloth collected, so that the products were standardized. After "rectifying villages," the Gaoyang cloth has achieved significant results in improving quality, and those that meet the first and second grade cloth standards have accounted for 60% to 70% of the total output. With the improvement of printing and dyeing technology, various colored cloths dyed by machines do not fade. After Jianhua hired technicians from Shanghai, the patterns of printed cloth were novel and comparable to those in major cities, and were popular with cloth buyers from all over the country.

　　Due to the improvement in quality, Gaoyang cloth is now selling well in Northeast, Northwest, and Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan markets. In the past, the sales of cloth were not smooth in winter, but this winter, the monthly output was more than 70,000 bolts, and the supply still fell short of demand. The sales of Gaoyang cloth in Shijiazhuang have accounted for 70% of the total market sales.

　　However, in order to further recover and develop the Gaoyang cloth industry, it is necessary to pay attention to solving the following problems: (1) The supply of cotton yarn. According to the current number of looms, 70,000 to 80,000 bundles of cotton yarn are needed every month, but public enterprises and cooperatives can only supply 42,000 bundles per month. Although private merchants are mobilized to transport a part, it cannot be maintained regularly. (2) Establishing village-level cooperatives to unify supply and marketing business is the urgent requirement of the vast number of weaving households. Many weaving households in villages are dozens of miles away from the city, wasting a lot of manpower to deliver cloth and pick up yarn from public enterprises. Although there are weaving groups organized by three to five households in each village, there is a lack of a production organization form based on the village as a unit—cooperatives. Public enterprises cannot rely on the masses to further improve production through cooperatives, and establish collective exchange relations with them. (3) Public enterprises should implement a contract system with organized cooperatives or weaving groups in order to reduce blindness in production and drive private capital to further develop production. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has begun to sign contracts with villages such as Nanyutian and Xiliutan, fixing the delivery standards and profits, so that production will not be interrupted. This method should be vigorously promoted in the future.

　　高阳织布业现况
    林放　高煦亭
    高阳织布业，在公营企业部门及合作社的大力扶植下，已迅速走上恢复的道路。现有织布机三千多张恢复生产，日出布二千五百匹。
    高阳织布业的恢复是走过一些弯路的。京津解放后，公营企业部门对高阳布业的历史基础和在当地人民经济生活中的重要地位认识不足，盲目的估计“京津解放后，细布下乡，高阳织布业即无大前途”，因此对之几乎放弃领导和扶持，形成原料缺乏，销路日蹙现象，一度使活动着的三千三百张织布机减为一千五百张。后因当地雨水成灾，该县经济委员会在公营企业部门指导下，对织布业作了专门研究，决定了大力扶植的方针，使织布业恢复起来。
    首先，国营花纱布公司、省营建华染轧厂、县供销社以大力解决了群众资金困难，大量散线收布，开付定量工资，使二千二百张织布机重新生产，对高阳布业恢复起决定作用。同时，当地各级政府加强了对群众生产的组织领导，使不少村庄的工具资金和人力组织起来。东赵布、傅家营、良村合伙织布小组，约占全村织户的三分之二。良村孟昌（中共村支部组织委员）陈光（中共村支部宣传委员）两个组，二十五户十八张机子，人力与工具结合后。昼夜轮流织，歇人不歇机，大大节省了人力。过去到高阳交布拿线往返五十里，每户必须去一人，现在每组去一人，每次节省了人力二十三个。另外，许多织户在中共支部和党员带动下，变死财为活财，将临时用不着的家具、衣服等卖掉，购买织布机，东赵布等五村即新添织布机八十九张。赵口村群众并帮助军属和灾民买织布机四张，解决了四户军属、八户灾民的生活问题。对有工具而资金缺乏的户，在旧有基础上发动了互助互借。各村资金缺乏的织户，都是多拴经线，少留纬线；纬线不足时，向别户随借随还，尽力作到机子不停。
    其次是提高质量，打开销路。高阳织布业，是广大农村以户为单位分散的小生产，历史上仰仗着中间商人供纱收布，织户在商人和雇主的苛重剥削下，往往被迫偷工减料，致使布的质量降低，销路渐趋不振。因此，在目前情况下，恢复高阳布市场的主要关键，在于提高布的质量，打开销路。该县各界代表会对织布业曾制订“整庄”的具体方案，把白布、条格布都定出四种标准分为四等。每一等都具体规定经纬线数目和宽长尺码、重量等。同时，工商局加强了市场管理和商品检验工作，按“整庄”标准，每一等布同在一个市场上出售，以免鱼目混珠；税务局在发予商贩运货证时，同时检查质量，以保持成品质量水平。为了保持色布信用，并向各染户说明皂色与颜色要严格分开，不准以皂色冒充颜色。花纱布公司在市场收购中，对够“整庄”标准的布悉数收购，不够标准的除适当降低工资外，并教育其以后改进。建华工厂对“撤机”户，每届月终根据交布质量分别张榜公布，以示鼓励与批评。建华工厂和花纱布公司按照收布种类，制贴商标牌号，使产品规格化。经过“整庄”后，高阳布在提高质量上已获显著成绩，合乎一二等布标准的，已占总产量百分之六十到七十。加以印花、染轧技术之改进，机器染轧之各种色布，已不褪色。建华从上海聘来技师后，印花布花样新颖，堪与各大城市的印花媲美，颇受各地购布商欢迎。
    高阳布业由于质量提高，现已畅销到东北、西北及晋、冀、鲁、豫等地市场。在过去，布业冬季销路不畅，但今冬月产七万余匹，仍感供不应求。石家庄销售高阳布已占市场总销量百分之七十。
    但高阳布业为求得进一步恢复与发展，还需要注意解决下面几个问题：（一）棉纱供给问题。按目前织机数目，每月需用棉纱七至八万捆，公营企业、合作社每月只能供给四万二千捆。其余虽发动私商贩运一部分，但不能保持经常。（二）建立村级合作社统一供销业务，是广大织布户的迫切要求。许多村庄织户，距城数十里，向公营企业交布取线，浪费人力极大。各村虽有三、五户组织起来的织布小组，但缺乏以村为单位的生产组织形式——合作社，公营企业不能通过合作社依靠群众进一步提高生产，并与之订立集体的交换关系。（三）公营企业应与已组织起来的合作社或织布小组实行订立合同制。以减少生产中的盲目性，并带动私资，进一步发展生产。现花纱布公司已与南玉田、西柳滩等村开始订立合同，固定交货标准与利润，使生产不致中断，今后应大力提倡这种方法。
