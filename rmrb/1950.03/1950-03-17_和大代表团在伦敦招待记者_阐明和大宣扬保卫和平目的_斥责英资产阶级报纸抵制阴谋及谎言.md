Xinhua News Agency, London, March 15th: According to TASS, the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, which has arrived in London to present a petition for the defense of peace to the British Parliament, held a press conference to explain the purpose of their visit.

Although invitations were sent out early by the organizers of the reception to all newspapers and news agencies in London, only representatives from the Newspaper Proprietors Association and the London office of a local newspaper attended the reception from the bourgeois press. This boycott of the reception by the bourgeois newspapers reflects their opposition to the purpose of the delegation's visit.

Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, said at the reception that Soviet representatives Simonov and Kabalevsky, as well as Hungarian Archbishop Janos, had not been granted entry permits by the British government and were therefore currently staying in Prague and unable to continue their journey. The British Peace Committee has lodged a strong protest with the British Foreign Office regarding this matter.

Sevauz, a member of the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and a member of the French National Assembly, pointed out that in the face of the danger of a new war that is in fact being prepared, people all over the world must organize to propagate the idea of peace. He said: "We are trying to do something that has not been done before, that is, under the initiative of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, to organize people of various political parties, various professions, and various beliefs to fight together for peace."

He denounced the argument that the delegation only represents the interests of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party as "deliberate lies." He said: "These lies are being spread by imperialists and those with blood on their hands. What the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress represents is the interests of all mankind."

　　和大代表团在伦敦招待记者
    阐明和大宣扬保卫和平目的
    斥责英资产阶级报纸抵制阴谋及谎言
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：已抵达伦敦准备向英国议会递交保卫和平呼吁书的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的代表团，举行记者招待会，说明此行目的。
    邀请出席的请帖虽早由招待会的主持者分送伦敦所有的报馆和通讯社，但资产阶级报纸出席招待会的，仅有报业联合会和一家地方报纸的伦敦办事处的代表。资产阶级报纸对于招待会的这种抵制，反映出他们怎样反对代表团此行的目的。
    英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟于招待会上讲话时说：苏联代表西蒙诺夫和卡巴列夫斯基以及匈牙利大主教雅诺斯，未被英国政府发给入境许可证，因此他们目前停留在布拉格而不能继续其行程。英国和平委员会为此已向英国外交部提出强烈抗议。
    和大常委会代表团团员、法国国民议会议员塞伏兹指出：面对着事实上正在准备中的新战争危险，全世界人民必须组织起来宣扬和平观念。他说：“我们正在尝试做一些以前没有做过的事情，即是在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的发起之下，把各种政党、各种职业，以及各种信仰的人士组织起来，共同为争取和平而奋斗。”
    他斥责那些硬说代表团只代表苏联和共产党利益的论调为“处心积虑的谎话”。他说：“这些谎话正由帝国主义者和手上沾着鲜血的人们散播着。而和大常委会代表团所代表的则是整个人类的利益。”
