　　Public Self-Criticism of Errors in Grain Transportation Work
    Pingyuan Provincial Government Handles the Puyang Incident
    The main reason for the errors was bureaucracy. Negligent cadres will be punished. Those with merit will be commended. The provincial government also requests punishment.
    The Provincial Government has submitted a report to the Government Administration Council, the Financial and Economic Committee, and the Supervisory Committee.
    [Our Dispatch] Chao Zhefu, Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, and Vice Chairmen Jia Xinzhai and Han Zhey, jointly sent a letter to this newspaper on March 15, stating: "We are now sending you a report from our province regarding the inspection of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office grain transportation incident and the handling of negligent cadres. This document is a report to the Government Administration Council and includes our government's opinions on the handling of cadres, requests for instructions on punishment, and a self-criticism of the incident. Please publish it in the newspaper to educate all comrades." The errors in the Puyang Special District's grain transportation work and the people's losses were reported in this newspaper on March 9. The original text of Chairman Chao's and Vice Chairmen Jia's and Han's report is as follows:
    To Premier Zhou of the Government Administration Council, Deputy Premiers Dong, Chen, Guo, and Huang, and Director Chen of the Financial and Economic Committee, Deputy Directors Bo and Ma, and Director Tan of the People's Supervision Committee, Deputy Directors Liu and Pan:
    We hereby report on the inspection of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office grain transportation incident in our province and the handling of negligent cadres as follows:
    Before the autumn tax collection, the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office delivered the trade grain approved by the Central Finance Department to the grain company according to the provincial government's plan. Therefore, during the autumn storage, they jointly carried out the grain transportation and collection work with the grain depot. Through the agreement between the Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the grain branch company, the special zone established three grain collection stations at Daokou, Yuancun, and Chuwang, and two grain collection points at Puyang and Xianzhuang. The Chuwang station had jurisdiction over four grain collection points along the Wei River. The total amount of grain transported was 40,000,000 jin. The establishment of grain stations was mainly led by the government, which sent people to serve as station chiefs, and the company sent people to serve as deputy station chiefs to specifically lead the grain collection work. More specifically, for those who sent grain from two counties to one point, the district treasury sent people to serve as station chiefs; for those who sent grain from one county to one point, the county sent people to serve as station chiefs. The grain collection stations were established on December 30 and officially received grain on the 1st, completing the task on the 15th. However, due to the rough and careless arrangements and the failure to conduct in-depth inspections afterward, the comrades specifically engaged in this work committed bureaucracy, resulting in a backlog of vehicles and causing the masses to suffer great pain and enormous losses in the snowy and icy conditions.

    Accumulation of Vehicles and Grain, and Losses to the Masses: Situation and Causes

    I. According to our understanding, the accumulation of vehicles and grain at each station, and the losses suffered by the masses, were as follows:
    1. Accumulation of Vehicles and Grain: Yuancun Grain Collection Station: Due to Puyang County's early delivery of grain in violation of the prescribed time, 880,000 jin of grain accumulated from the 8th to the 10th, and was cleared by the 11th; accumulated vehicles stretched from south of Yuancun to Qingshigun Village (18 li), with vehicles delivering grain parked in every village. Later, it was learned that Puyang's Fifth District alone had more than 100 accumulated vehicles (a total of six districts sent grain here). Daokou Grain Station: The Shenzhuang grain collection point under its jurisdiction received 108 carts on the 30th, which were unloaded and returned on the 1st and 2nd. On the 1st, 170 carts arrived, which were unloaded and returned the same day, and were cleared by the 3rd. More than 30 carts accumulated at Dawuzhuang from the 30th to the 3rd, and were cleared by the 4th. The Chuwang Grain Collection Station accumulated 30 large carts and 18 small carts, which were cleared from the 8th to the 14th.
    2. Losses to the Masses: During the weighing process at the grain stations, one person died from drinking cold water due to excessive sweating and our failure to prepare tea. Three people died from eating cold steamed buns and frozen eggs due to snow obstruction en route. According to preliminary incomplete statistics, 56 cattle and 39 donkeys, a total of 95 animals, froze to death; 2 cattle and 3 donkeys, a total of 5 animals, were injured. Other vehicle losses are still under investigation and statistics.
    II. Causes of the Losses:
    1. First of all, the provincial government did not attach sufficient importance to this work and underestimated the objective difficulties, resulting in complacency. There was no unified leadership for this work. Therefore, only cadres from the grain department discussed the arrangements, and the commissioners and county magistrates did not study them at the financial meeting. Even in the research by the grain bureau, there was no specific study on how to organize forces. When the grain bureau and the grain company reached an agreement, it was limited to procedural and numerical issues. When the phenomenon of frozen livestock deaths was discovered, it did not attract high attention, but was attributed to objective conditions. The comrades who went down to inspect the work were also limited to understanding the number of entries, the type and quality of grain, and did not discover problems or pay attention to the difficulties of the masses. It was not until the Puyang Special District's grain transportation losses formed that the provincial government organized an inspection team to go for inspection. This shows that the provincial government's leadership of grain work was bureaucratic and seriously lacked a mass perspective. We have deeply examined this and learned a lesson from it.
    2. The Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office failed to attach importance to the grain collection and transportation work. Commissioner Liu Jingxi did not make arrangements beforehand, left to inspect other work, and did not ask about it afterward. Deputy Commissioner Li Lige also failed to personally lead and grasp it, but entrusted it to Wang Jiyun, secretary of the district treasury. At the meeting, only Diao Songshan, deputy section chief of the finance section, briefly talked about preventing theft, preventing the freezing to death of livestock and people, and paying attention to autumn tax collection propaganda and organizing and leading vehicles in grain collection, but the specific methods were not studied and the arrangements were made in a general way. There was no core leadership, and there was no inspection afterward. Even the prefectural commissioner's office did not understand the storage and collection work in Puyang City, where it was located. The grain depot also failed to combine the forces of all relevant parties to carry out this work, forming the situation of warehouse cadres carrying it out in isolation. The same lack of importance was attached to this work in the counties. For example, the director of the Hua County warehouse did not report to the county magistrate after returning from the meeting at the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the director and deputy director of the Puyang County warehouse did not jointly study the matter, resulting in inconsistent opinions. When making arrangements for the districts, it was not specific. For example, Puyang only said that tasks would be allocated according to the autumn tax collection and grain would be transported in batches. There was no fixed quantity and no clear time. This formed a series of numbness and negligence from top to bottom, lacking concrete organization and leadership, and a serious error of irresponsibility to the masses. This is the basic reason for this major loss.
    3. The cadres specifically engaged in this work committed bureaucracy and were indifferent to the suffering of the masses. First of all, Wang Jiyun, secretary of the district treasury, when appointed as the station chief of the Daokou Grain Station, returned home privately for three days, and did not go to set up the station until the weighing period began. In fact, the grain had already accumulated and time was pressing, making it difficult to quickly weigh all of it. Wang Zhaoyin, the deputy station chief of the station, and Wang Yanxu, the director of the Hua County warehouse (the second deputy station chief), did not actively find ways to solve the problem of grain accumulation before Wang Jiyun took office, but adopted a passive waiting attitude. For example, Zhao Hongkui, deputy station chief of the Chuwang Grain Station, was supposed to arrive at the station on the 8th, but did not go to work because he was afraid of the cold and snow. It was not until Feng Lingyun, director of the Qingfeng County warehouse, personally urged him through the snow that he went to start weighing on the 12th, which made the masses wait for him for several days in the snow. Furthermore, since the Yuancun station had already accumulated vehicles, Xie Linsheng, the deputy director of the district treasury, did not consider how to solve the problem and improve weighing efficiency to reduce the suffering of the masses, but still mechanically implemented "working hours." Wei Yongjiu (section chief of the grain branch company), a cadre of the Daokou station, did not actively lead the establishment of the station and the weighing despite repeated urging from cadres and the masses, which affected the weighing time and made the masses wait for a full day and night. When arranging the grain collection points, the address was wrong. Even Hua County's 11th district financial assistant mistakenly pointed out the grain delivery point to the masses, causing more than 30 large carts from more than ten villages to travel back and forth 30 li in the snow, and one person was frozen unconscious (later resuscitated with fire). Li Jiatun in Puyang's Eighth District requested to postpone delivery to the district because the snow and mud prevented traffic (40 li from the grain collection point), but the district firmly refused and ordered them to deliver quickly. The village cadres had no choice but to hold a meeting to mobilize the masses and personally took the lead in carrying grain, with 96 people participating, each carrying 40 jin, which made the masses very dissatisfied, and even cursed the government. The occurrence of these serious problems and phenomena is the evil consequence of the bureaucracy of the comrades who specifically carried out this task.

    Several Manifestations of Bureaucracy Among Grain Transportation Cadres

    4. Failure to resolutely implement resolutions, and even changing resolutions at will, was particularly prominent in Neihuang. It agreed with Qingfeng to build a pontoon bridge on the Wei River and specifically agreed on the grain delivery time for the two counties. Because the autumn tax collection task had not been completed, it sent a telegram to the district treasury to order Qingfeng to postpone delivery (in fact, Qingfeng's grain had already been loaded and set off), and then collect Qingfeng's grain after its autumn grain was delivered. It did not take care of neighboring counties, but proceeded solely from its own position. Jin Wenqing, the section chief of the district treasury, did not give a clear answer after receiving the call, resulting in Qingfeng's grain being delivered without anyone receiving it, and Neihuang's pontoon bridge was not built. Furthermore, the original decision was that Nanle County would be responsible for setting up a firewood station in Yuancun, but Nanle County requested the district treasury not to set up a firewood station due to difficulties, and Jin, the section chief of the district treasury, did not give a clear answer, resulting in Nanle not setting up a firewood station. When vehicles were crowded, firewood was as expensive as rice, which was an important reason for the death and illness of livestock. Puyang County's early delivery of grain also made it difficult for the grain to be weighed quickly, and the district did not implement the instruction to deliver grain in batches. For example, some districts in Puyang County used all their manpower and animal power to transport grain in order to complete the task, without considering the grain station's grain collection situation, and some districts delivered several days in advance. This sloppy and casual change of resolutions is also an important reason for the crowding of vehicles and the accumulation of grain.
    In addition, grain transportation and collection were not well combined, and special vehicles were not arranged to send special grain (one type of grain). However, when collecting grain, special scales were used to weigh special grain, which caused a cart of grain to be weighed in several places, also delaying the weighing time.

    III. Handling of Several Cadre Issues:
    1. Liu Jingxi, commissioner of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, as the commissioner, did not ask about such an important task when making arrangements beforehand, and did not actively inspect and deal with it after the errors occurred. He did not attach importance to the grain transportation task and adopted a laissez-faire attitude, causing losses to the masses. Although it is excusable because he went to the counties several times to inspect other work, he should bear considerable responsibility for causing this enormous loss. It is proposed to give the cadre a demerit and report to the Government Administration Council for approval.

    Distinguish the Merits and Demerits of Cadres, and Give Appropriate Rewards and Punishments One by One

    2. Li Lige, deputy commissioner of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, was in charge of financial tasks, but neglected financial work. After the bad grain incident in Changyuan, it still did not attract attention. He did not personally lead and grasp this grain transportation, but entrusted this major task to the secretary of the district treasury, making hasty arrangements. After the problem occurred, he lacked a spirit of self-criticism and shirked responsibility, and did not actively inspect and quickly deal with it. This serious bureaucratic style is the root cause of the losses and is no longer competent for the position of deputy commissioner. It is proposed to give the cadre a demotion and report to the Government Administration Council for approval.
    3. Liu Yuncheng, director of the financial section of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and director of the district treasury, returned to the agency as soon as the grain transportation meeting ended and had not yet started to transport. The cadre did not actively supervise or proactively inspect this task, and always held a negative and passive attitude, failing to fulfill his responsibilities. Give a major demerit.
    4. Xie Linsheng, deputy director of the district treasury of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office (the cadre was on sick leave during the grain transportation arrangements), arrived at the Yuancun station on January 8. At that time, a large number of vehicles gathered. The cadre did not actively deal with it, causing the masses to suffer from freezing and hunger in the wind and snow, and did not widely convey the commissioner's office's decision to unload the grain trucks and return. The responsibilities were not fulfilled. Give a demerit.
    5. Wang Jiyun, secretary of the district treasury of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, served as the station chief of the Daokou grain collection station and set up the station before December 30, receiving grain on December 31. He should have arrived at the station in advance to prepare and organize forces, but the cadre left his post without permission after accepting the task on the 26th, and returned home privately on the 27th, only arriving at Daokou on the 30th. Vehicles had already arrived at the station, but he did not actively allocate forces to receive them. This serious dereliction of duty caused a backlog of vehicles and led to losses. Give the punishment of removal from office.
    6. Jin Wenqing, section chief of the district treasury of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, was responsible for the work of the district treasury at the time, but turned a deaf ear to the Chu Wang station’s request to slow down the shipping from Qingfeng, and did not express any attitude towards the one-sided opinion of the Nanle County government not to set up a grain station. This serious attitude of liberalism caused the accumulation of vehicles and the lack of grain and grass at Yuancun and Chu Wang stations, resulting in losses. The cadre's work has always been not active or responsible. Give the punishment of removal from office.
    7. Zhao Hongkui, business section chief of the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Branch Company, served as the deputy station chief of the Chuwang grain collection station, and controlled the receiving tools. He lived in Fanzhuang, nine li south of the station. The station repeatedly requested that Qingfeng’s grain, which arrived at the Chuwang station on the 9th, still excused himself due to the cold weather and heavy snow, which made it inconvenient to move. He only used a lever scale to receive a part on the 12th, and officially received it on the 13th. This fear of hardship, procrastination, laziness, and lack of mass concept has greatly harmed the masses. Give the punishment of removal from office.
    In addition, the cadre lost nine packages of public grain totaling 1,800 jin in the Puyang County grain transportation due to fear of hardship and irresponsibility. Therefore, it was decided to deduct all of his monthly salary of 340 jin except for the necessary living expenses of 150 jin, and continue for six months to compensate for the state's losses.
    8. Wang Zhaoyin, deputy manager of the Pingyuan Provincial Daokou Grain Branch Company, served as the deputy station chief of the Daokou Station. Before the station chief Wang Jiyun took office, he should have assumed all responsibilities, but the cadre passively waited without preparing. This phenomenon of laziness should not have occurred. Give a major demerit.
    9. Wei Yongjiu, a cadre of the Daokou Grain Station and section chief of the grain branch company, did not adopt the correct opinion of the masses to receive the grain so that they could return to the village as soon as possible, but insisted on finding houses to arrange accommodation, causing the masses to wait for a whole day and night and suffer some undue pain. Give a warning.
    10. The Puyang Prefectural Commissioner’s Office should order the Puyang County magistrate to inspect and reflect on the error of delivering grain in violation of the superior's decision, and order the Nanle County magistrate to inspect and reflect on the incorrect excuse attitude of not wanting to set up a firewood station. This is the main reason for the accumulation of a large number of vehicles at the Yuancun Station, and the inspection results will be reported to the Provincial Government. The grain branch company also has a responsibility and should also inspect and report.
    11. Wang Zhaoxiang, director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, was sent to work in Huxi and has not returned. Deputy Director Liu Peicen was satisfied with the past achievements in grain transportation, became numb and negligent, and limited himself to numbers and procedures in the arrangement. He did not give due instructions on the organization of transportation forces, the difficulties of the masses, and the possible problems, and did not even pay attention to the fact that Wang Jiyun, the secretary of the Puyang District Treasury, could not bring back the spirit of the meeting, and did not provide timely assistance and inspection. After the problem occurred, the circular issued emphasized the objective reasons for the losses of the masses, and did not conduct a specific subjective examination. This kind of bureaucracy is an important reason for the losses. It is proposed to give Liu Peicen, deputy director of the Grain Bureau, a major demerit and report to the Government Administration Council for approval. Director Wang Zhaoxiang will be exempted from punishment.
    12. The cadres of the Eighth District of Puyang adopted a simple task point of view, failed to take into account the objective situation, and strictly ordered the masses to deliver grain, which caused the village cadres of Li Jiatun to lead the masses to carry grain 40 li in the snow, which not only increased the undue suffering of the masses, but also had a bad influence and reduced the prestige of the government. The county should conduct an inspection and deal with it appropriately and report to the Provincial Government. The financial assistant of the 11th District of Hua County rudely pointed out the wrong grain collection point to the masses, causing more than 30 large vehicles to travel back and forth 30 li in the snow, and one person was frozen unconscious. This kind of rough and sloppy work style should also be deeply reflected upon.
    13. The Provincial Government also has insufficient understanding of this work, underestimated the situation, and ignored the difficult side. Therefore, it did not conduct a special study at the Provincial Finance Conference, but handed it over to the grain department to do it. Afterward, it did not organize forces to help and inspect. After the problem occurred, it became vigilant and sent personnel to inspect. Afterward, although the Provincial Government held a meeting to inspect and criticize the grain bureau and the grain branch company, the punishment of the responsible personnel for the incident was not quickly decided. These were all manifestations of failing to fulfill the leadership responsibility. In addition to making a self-criticism, we will also report to the Government Administration Council and request punishment.
    In addition, Comrade Feng Lingyun, director of the Qingfeng County warehouse, led the grain transport vehicles to Chu Wang. At that time, due to the snowy weather, the pontoon bridge was not built, and the cadre immediately transported the grain by boat. When he arrived at the station, no one received him, and he actively unloaded the grain and directed the vehicles to return. Deputy Station Chief Zhao Hongkui was afraid of the cold and did not go to receive the grain. Feng personally waded through the snow to find Deputy Director Zhao and urged him to work. This serious and responsible work spirit is worthy of commendation and will be praised in a circular.
    The village cadres of Li Jiatun in the Eighth District of Puyang led the masses to personally carry grain for more than 40 li under difficult conditions in order to complete the grain delivery task. This spirit of not fearing difficulties, not being afraid of hardships, and serving the masses will also be commended.

　　公开检讨运粮工作中的错误
    平原省府处理濮阳事件
    造成错误原因主要是官僚主义。对失职干部决加以处分。有功者表扬。省府亦自请处分。
    平原省府已向政务院及财委会监委会提出报告
    【本报讯】平原省人民政府主席晁哲甫，副主席贾心斋、韩哲一在三月十五日联名致函本报，称：“兹送去本省关于濮阳专署运粮事件检查及对失职干部处理的报告一份。该件系向政务院之报告，内有本府对干部处理、请示处分的意见，和对该事件的检讨。烦公诸报端，以教育全体同志”。按濮阳专区运粮工作中的错误和人民损失情况载三月九日本报。晁主席和贾、韩副主席的报告原文如下：
    政务院周总理，董、陈、郭、黄副总理并财经委员会陈主任，薄、马副主任人民监察委员会谭主任，刘、潘副主任：
    兹将本省濮阳专署运粮事件检查及对于失职干部处理情形报告如下：
    濮阳专署秋征前，即依省府布置将中财部批拨之贸易粮食交付粮食公司，故在秋屯中结合粮库共同进行运粮收粮工作，经由专署与粮食分公司双方协议，该专区共设道口、元村、楚旺三个收粮站，濮阳、仙庄两收粮点。楚旺站下辖沿卫河四个收粮点，运粮总数为四○○○万斤。粮站建立以政府为主，并派人任站长，公司派人任副站长，具体领导收粮工作，更具体决定两县向一点送粮者，由区库派人任站长，一县向一点送粮者，由县派人任站长，收粮站于十二月三十号建立起来，一号正式接收，十五号完成任务。但由于布置上粗枝大叶，事后又未深入检查，具体进行此工作的同志又犯了官僚主义，致车辆积压，使群众在雪天冰地里遭受莫大痛苦及巨大损失。
    积压车辆、粮食及群众损失情况和原因
    一、根据了解，各站积压车辆、粮食及群众损失情况：
    １、车辆粮食积压情况：元村收粮站：因濮阳县不按规定时间提早送粮，从八号到十号积压粮八十八万斤，至十一号收清；压积车辆，从元村南至清石滚村（十八里），每村均停有送粮车辆，事后了解仅濮阳五区即积压百余辆（共六个区向此送粮）。道口粮站：所属申庄收粮点三十号到大车一○八辆，一号、二号卸下后返回，一号到车一七○辆，卸车后当日返回，至三号收清。大武庄三十号至三号积压三十余辆，至四号收清。楚旺收粮站积压大车三十辆，小车十八辆，从八号至十四号始收清。
    ２、群众损失：群众在粮站过磅中，因出汗过多，我们无茶水准备，致喝冷水病死者一人，中途因雪阻而吃冷馍雪蛋致病死者三人。牲口冻病死者据初步不完全统计牛五十六头，驴三十九头，共九十五头，伤牛二头，驴三头，共五头。另车辆亦有损失正调查统计中。
    二、造成损失的原因：
    １、首先省府对这一工作的领导没有足够的重视，对客观困难估计不足，因之产生了麻痹思想。对此工作没有统一的领导，故布置时仅由粮食部门干部进行了讨论，没有在财政会议上由专员县长加以研究，即在粮食局研究中，也没有具体研究如何组织力量，粮食局与粮食公司协议时，亦仅限于手续数字问题。发现牲口冻死现象，尚未引起高度注意，而推之于客观情况。下去检查工作的同志，亦仅限于入库数字，粮食种类质量的了解，没有去发现问题注意群众困难。直至濮阳专区运粮损失形成后，省府才组织检查组前往检查，这说明省府对粮食工作的领导是官僚主义的，严重的缺乏群众观念，对此已深刻检查引为教训。
    ２、濮阳专署对收粮运粮工作未能重视，专员刘镜西事前未作布置，出发检查其他工作，事后亦未过问，副专员李立格亦未能亲自领导掌握，而委托给区库秘书王际云。在会议上仅由财科副科长刁松山简单谈了一下防止偷盗、防止冻死牲口、冻死人，和注意在收粮中进行秋征宣传与组织带领车辆，但具体办法没有研究，就笼统的布置下去，既无核心领导，后又没有检查，甚至专署对驻地濮阳城内屯收工作都不了解，粮库亦未能结合各有关方面力量进行此一工作，形成仓库干部孤立的进行；而在县里对这一工作亦同样的没有重视，如滑县仓库主任在专署开会返回后没有向县长汇报，濮阳县仓库正副主任根本没有到一块共同研究，因之意见不能一致。在对区布置时，不明确具体，如濮阳只说按秋征分配任务，分批运送，既无一定数量，亦没明确时间，这样便形成自上而下一系列的麻痹忽视，缺乏具体的组织领导，对群众不负责的严重错误，这是造成此一重大损失的基本原因。
    ３、具体进行这一工作的干部犯了官僚主义，对群众疾苦漠不关心。首先区库秘书王际云被派任道口粮站站长时，私自返家三天，迟至开始过磅期间始去设站，而实际粮食已形成积压，时间迫促，难能全部迅速过磅。该站副站长王朝印，滑县仓库主任王雁序（第二副站长），在王际云未到职前，不去积极设法解决粮食积压问题，采取消极等待态度。另如楚旺粮站副站长赵洪魁，本应八号到站，因怕雪冷未到职，经清丰县仓库主任冯凌云同志亲自冒雪催促，迟至十二号方去开始过磅，这就使群众在雪天里等他数天之久。再如元村站既已积压了车辆，但区库副主任谢林生，不去考虑如何解决提高过磅效率，使群众减少痛苦，反仍机械执行“作息时间”。道口站干部魏永久（粮食支公司股长），虽经干部与群众屡次催促，仍不去积极领导建站过磅，而影响了过磅时间，使群众等待一昼夜之久。在布置收粮点时，将地址搞错，甚而滑县十一区财助错指了群众送粮点，致十余村三十余大车雪天里往返三十余里，群众冻昏一人（后用火熏苏醒）。濮阳八区李家屯，因雪后泥洼阻隔不能通车（距收粮点四十余里），向区里要求缓送，区则坚不允许，严令速送，村干没法，开会动员亲自带头带领群众背粮，参加者九十六人，每人背四十斤，使群众十分不满，甚而骂政府，这些严重问题现象的发生，是具体执行这一任务的同志官僚主义所产生的恶果。
    运粮干部官僚主义的几种表现
    ４、不能坚决执行决议，甚而随便变更决议，此点尤以内黄为甚。其与清丰协议由其在卫河架设浮桥，并具体协议了两县送粮时间，因秋征任务未完成，故电请区库转令清丰缓送（实际清丰粮食已装车起程），待他的秋粮送完后再收清丰粮食。不照顾邻县，单从本位出发，而区库股长靳文卿接电话后，未明确答复，致清丰粮食送到无人接收，内黄浮桥亦未搭起。再如原决定南乐县负责在元村设柴草站，而南乐县以困难故，电请区库请求不设柴草站，而区库靳股长亦未明确答复，致南乐未设柴草站，车辆拥挤时，柴草贵与米等，牲畜死、病此为重要原因之一。濮阳县提前送粮，也难能使粮食迅速过磅，区里也未执行分批送粮的指示。如濮阳县有的区尽所有人力畜力进行运送，以完成任务为了事，不估计粮站收粮情况，有的区提前数日运到。这种马虎潦草随便变更决议也是造成车辆拥挤粮食积压的重要原因之一。
    另外运粮收粮没有很好结合，没有布置专车送专粮（一种粮食），而收粮时，则以专磅过专粮，使一车粮食数处过磅，也延误了过磅时间。
    三、几个干部问题的处理：
    １、濮阳专署专员刘镜西，身为专员对如此重要工作事前布置时竟未过问，事后错误发生时又未积极检查处理，对运粮任务不加重视，采取放任态度，造成对群众损失。虽因彼时曾数次到县检查其他工作，不无可原，但对造成此一巨大损失应负相当责任。拟给予该员记大过处分，报请政务院批核。
    分别干部功过大小  一一予以适当奖惩
    ２、濮阳专署副专员李立格，身负财政任务，却轻视财政工作。在长垣坏粮事件发生之后，仍未引起注意。对此次运粮不亲自领导与掌握，把这一重大任务交给区库秘书去负责，布置草率。问题发生后又缺乏自我批评精神，推却责任，又未积极检查迅速处理。此种严重的官僚主义作风，是造成损失的根本原因，已不能胜任副专员之责。拟给予撤职处分，报请政务院批核。
    ３、濮阳专署财政科长兼区库主任刘云程，当运粮会议刚结束尚未开始起运之际，即回到机关。该员对此任务不积极督促，不主动检查，始终抱着消极被动态度，有失职责。给予记大过处分。
    ４、濮阳专署区库副主任谢林生（在运粮布置中该员因病请假），一月八日到达元村站，斯时大批车辆云集，该员未积极处理，使群众遭受风雪中冻馁之苦，对专署布置卸粮车回去的决定未普遍传达，有失其职责。给予记过处分。
    ５、濮阳专署区库秘书王际云，任道口收粮站站长，十二月三十日以前设站，三十一日接收粮食。本应事前到职准备组织力量，但该员于二十六日接受任务后，擅离职守，私自于二十七日回家，三十日始达道口，车辆已经到站，又未积极分配力量进行接收。这种严重的怠工，造成车辆积压，招致损失。给予撤职处分。
    ６、濮阳专署区库股长靳文卿，当时负责区库工作，对楚旺站要求清丰缓运意见却置若罔闻，对南乐县府要求不设粮车站的片面意见不表示任何态度。这种严重的自由主义态度，造成元村、楚旺两站车辆积压缺乏粮草的现象而招致损失。该员工作一贯不积极负责。给予撤职处分。
    ７、平原省粮食分公司业务科科长赵洪奎，任楚旺收粮站副站长，掌握接收工具，住该站以南九里之范庄，对清丰九号运到楚旺站之粮食，虽经该站请催数次，仍借口天冷雪厚，不便行动，十二日用杆称接收一部，十三日正式接收。这种怕艰苦、拖延怠工、没有群众观念的表现，为害群众甚大。给予撤职处分。
    又该员在濮县运粮中，怕艰苦不负责任，因而丢失公粮九包计一千八百斤。因此决定从其每月三百四十斤的薪金中，除去必要的生活费用一百五十斤外，其余全部扣留，连续六个月，以赔偿国家的损失。
    ８、平原省道口粮食支公司副经理王朝印，任道口站副站长，当站长王际云未到职前，应负起全部责任，但该员只是消极等待不进行准备工作。这种怠工现象实不应有。给予记大过处分。
    ９、道口粮站干部，粮食支公司股长魏永久，对群众要求接收粮食，以便早日回村的正确意见，不加采纳，一意孤行的找房子按置住处，使群众等一日夜之久，受些不应有的痛苦。给予警告处分。
    １０、濮阳专署应责成濮阳县长检查反省不按上级决议送粮的错误，责成南乐县长检查反省不愿设柴草站的不正确的推却态度，这是造成元村站大批车辆积压主要原因，将检查结果报告省府。粮食分公司亦有责任，亦应检查报告。
    １１、省府粮食局局长王兆祥，派往湖西工作未回。副局长刘培岑，满足过去运粮成果，麻痹疏忽，在布置中只限于数目字及手续问题，对运输力量的组织，和群众困难及可能发生的问题未做应有指示，甚至对濮阳区库秘书王际云，不能将会议精神带回未加注意，亦未做到及时帮助与检查。问题发生之后，发出之通报，群众损失强调客观理由，不做具体的主观检查。此种官僚主义乃是造成损失的重要原因之一。粮局副局长刘培岑，拟给予记大过处分，报请政务院批核。局长王兆祥免予议处。
    １２、濮阳八区区干部采取单纯任务观点，不照顾客观情况，严令群众送粮，致李家屯村干带头群众雪地里背负，不单增加群众不应有之痛苦，且造成不良影响，降低政府威信。该县应做检查，适当处理报告省府。滑县十一区财政助理员粗鲁的错指群众收粮点，致三十余辆大车于雪地中往返三十余里，且冻昏一人。此种粗枝大叶的作风亦应深自反省。
    １３、省府对此工作同样认识不够，对情况估计不足，忽视困难的一面，故在省财政会议上未专作研究，只交粮食部门去做，事后未组织力量帮助和检查。问题发生后才引起警惕，派员前往检查，之后，虽在省府开会做了检查及批评了粮食局粮食分公司，但对该事件之失职人员处分则未迅速议定。此均为未尽到领导责任的表现。除做检讨外，并报政务院请求处分。
    此外，清丰县仓库主任冯凌云同志，带领送粮车辆到达楚旺，当时因雪天浮桥未搭，该员当即用船摆运。到站后无人接收，积极将粮卸下，指挥车辆回去。副站长赵洪奎因怕冷不去接收，冯又亲自踏雪寻找赵副站长催其到职工作。这种认真负责的工作精神殊堪嘉奖，给予通令表扬。
    濮阳八区李家屯村干部，在困难条件下，领导群众亲自背粮四十余里，以此完成送粮任务。这种不怕困难，不畏艰苦，为群众服务的精神，亦予表扬。
