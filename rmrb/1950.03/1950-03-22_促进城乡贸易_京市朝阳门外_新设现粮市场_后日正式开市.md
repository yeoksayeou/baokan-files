　　Promoting Urban-Rural Trade
    New Grain Market Established Outside Chaoyangmen, Beijing
    Officially Opens the Day After Tomorrow
    [Beijing News Agency] To facilitate merchants and residents and connect urban and rural trade, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce will add a spot grain market in the open space in the middle of Shenlu Street outside Chaoyangmen in the city. Preparations are complete, and it is scheduled to officially open the day after tomorrow (the 24th). Chaoyangmen is the main road to Jidong, Tongxian, Sanhe and other counties, and the grain source is considerable. Therefore, many "Dou Dian" shops, which are small grain stores, have been established. In the past, farmers who transported grain for sale always had to go through them, and they generally had to pay a 2% handling fee. This not only hindered the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas to a certain extent, but was also inconvenient to manage, and caused partial losses to tax revenue. After the new market opens, "Dou Dian" shops will be prohibited from trading outside the market, so as to carry out centralized management and unified taxation, which will make it easier for ordinary farmers to transport grain for sale. This market is a spot grain market, and small amounts of grain can also be traded. It is open all day from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. After the opening, the Second Grain Depot of the Beijing Grain Company will conduct purchases and sales in the market. The 13th District Office of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to sell agricultural tools and daily necessities in the market to facilitate farmers.

　　促进城乡贸易
    京市朝阳门外
    新设现粮市场
    后日正式开市
    【京市新闻处讯】为便利商民，沟通城乡贸易，京市商业局将在本市朝阳门外神路街中间空场增设一现粮市场，已经筹备就绪，定于后（二十四）日正式开市。朝阳门外为通冀东通县、三河等县要道，粮源相当大，因而一种小粮栈式的“斗店”开设很多。农民运粮求售的，过去一直要经过他们，一般要被抽百分之二的手续费。这不但在一定程度上妨碍城乡物资交流，且也不便管理，并使税收受到部分损失。新市场开市后，将禁止“斗店”场外成交，以便进行集中管理，统一税收，从而可使一般农民运粮求售得到方便。该市场为现粮市场，小量粮食也可成交，上午八时至下午五时整日营业。开市后，京市粮食公司第二粮栈将在场内进行收售，市供销合作社第十三区办事处已决定在市场内售卖农具及日常用品，便利农民。
