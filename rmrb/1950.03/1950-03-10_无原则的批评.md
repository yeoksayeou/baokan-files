　　Unprincipled Criticism
　　植

People with a certain degree of awareness have begun to learn to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and have achieved considerable results in transforming their ideology and improving work efficiency.

However, when using the weapon of criticism, there is often a bias: even trivial matters are elevated to the level of "principle" for criticism.

Here is a typical example:

A young student who had studied in a revolutionary school for a period of time wrote a letter to his friend in the South. He described his process of progress through relying on criticism and self-criticism, and described the process of daring to criticize after having reservations in the past. He enthusiastically introduced criticism to his friend. The motivation was very good. However, he was not good at criticizing.

He wrote: "Here, I want to criticize someone for you to see, who to criticize? I want to criticize you. You are too wasteful, as can be seen from the letter you sent. The stationery is foreign, and the envelope is also foreign. This fully demonstrates your extravagance and vanity." Then he wrote: "If you think this criticism of mine is correct, then this weapon will be handed over to you." Obviously, this young comrade's understanding of criticism is biased. If this is said to be correct criticism, and it is handed over to others without hesitation, it will do more harm than good.

If people receive this kind of criticism, or if they know that this kind of criticism exists, then it is conceivable that even if there are usable foreign envelopes on hand, they will have to buy non-foreign ones. Wouldn't that be even more "wasteful" and more "vain"? Moreover, a person using a foreign envelope once or twice may be using up what was left over from before, or may have conveniently grabbed it from a friend's place. It cannot be proved that he is a "luxury" expert who would not use anything other than pretty foreign envelopes. Furthermore, even if a person feels that foreign envelopes have the advantage of being water-resistant, or thinks they look better, buying a few to use is not a terrible shortcoming and is not worth criticizing.

Too much of this kind of criticism will instead lead to neglect of political, work-related, and ideological problems, making people afraid to spill a single grain of rice when eating and afraid of "wasting" shoe soles when walking, becoming "cautious gentlemen." Such criticism has made the Marxist-Leninist weapon of criticism vulgar and unbearable! It is like an evil mother-in-law managing a child bride with an inferior style to manage revolutionary workers!

This is the result of failing to distinguish between right and wrong, and between important and trivial matters.

This kind of person has a serious subjective and one-sided way of thinking. When he sees someone using beautiful stationery, he concludes that they are "extravagant and vain"; when he sees someone buying peanuts to eat twice, he concludes that they have "hedonistic thoughts." But he does not investigate whether these things, taken together, have formed a tendency in someone's thinking. He himself dresses sloppily and criticizes others for being neat, replacing political, work-related, and ideological principles with his own subjective likes and dislikes.

This kind of bias in criticism should be corrected ideologically.

Chairman Mao said: "The task of criticism, it should be understood that the most important thing is to point out political errors, followed by organizational errors. As for personal lifestyle shortcomings and minor technical aspects, if they are not closely related to political and organizational errors, there is no need to criticize them too much, so as not to make comrades at a loss. Moreover, if technical criticism develops, the spirit within the Party will be completely focused on ordinary technical aspects, and everyone will become cautious gentlemen, inevitably forgetting the Party's tasks. This is the greatest danger."

We only need this kind of criticism, we demand to carry out this kind of criticism, which always clearly places the Party's tasks before us, and calls us to battle!

### 无原则的批评

　　无原则的批评
    植
    有一定觉悟程度的人们，都开始学习运用批评与自我批评武器，并在改造思想意识，提高工作效率方面都收到不小的效果。
    但在运用批评这一武器时，常不免有偏向：把鸡毛蒜皮的事也提到“原则”上去批评。
    这里有一个典型的例子：
    一个在革命学校学习了一段时期的青年学生给他南方朋友的信。他叙述了自己依靠批评与自我批评得到进步的过程，叙述了过去有顾忌不敢批评到展开批评的过程，他热情地给他朋友介绍批评。动机非常好。然而他并不善于批评。
    他写道：“在这里，我要批评一个人给你看看，批评谁呢？就是要批评你。你太浪费了，由你寄来的信就可以看到。信纸是洋的，信封也是洋的，这充分表现了你的奢华和虚荣”。接着他又写：“我这样的批评，如果你认为正确，那么这武器就算交给你了”。显然这青年同学对批评的了解是有偏向的。如果说这就是正确的批评，并把它毫不踌躇地交给别人，这是益少害多的事。
    人们受到这种批评，或者他知道有这种批评，那么，可以想像：即使手边还有可用的洋信封，也要另外去买非洋式的了。岂不更加“浪费”，更加“虚荣”吗？何况，一个人用一二次洋式信封，也可能是从前留下来的，也可能是在朋友处顺手拉来的，还不能证明他是非漂亮的洋信封便不用的“奢侈”专家。再则，即使一个人觉得洋式信封有不怕水浸的好处，或者觉得好看些，买一点来用，也不算什么了不起的缺点，值不得批评。
    这类的批评一多，反而使政治上、工作上，思想上的问题遭到漠视，使人兢兢于吃饭不敢撒一粒小米，走路怕“浪费”鞋底，成为“谨小慎微的君子”。这样的批评是把马列主义的批评武器已经变得庸俗不堪！以恶姑管童养媳的恶劣作风去管革命工作者！
    这是不辨是非轻重的结果。
    这种人有着严重的主观，片面的思想方法。他看别人用了漂亮的信笺信封，就认定是“奢华虚荣”；他看见别人买了两次花生吃，便认定是“享乐思想”。而他并不去调查研究这些事联系起来是否已经在某人思想上成了一种倾向。他自己穿得肮脏，就批评别人的整洁，把自己主观的好恶代替政治上的工作上的思想上的原则问题。
    这种批评偏向是应该从思想上来纠正的。
    毛主席说：“批评的任务，不明白最大的是指出政治错误，其次才是指出组织上的错误，至于个人生活缺点及小的技术方面，如果不是与政治及组织的错误有密切的联系，则不必多所指摘，使同志们无所措手足。而且技术的批评一发展，党内精神完全集注到寻常技术方面，人人变成了谨小慎微的君子，必然要忘记党的任务，这是最大的危险。”
    我们只需要这样的批评，我们要求开展这样的批评，它随时把党的任务明白地摆在我们面前，它召呼我们战斗！
