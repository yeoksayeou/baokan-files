　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Choi Chang-ik, the Minister of Finance of the Korean government, recently presented a draft of the national comprehensive budget for Korea in 1950 at the fifth session of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly. According to the draft, the total revenue of Korea this year will reach 25,222,274,000 won (Note: 1 Korean won is currently equivalent to 50 RMB), an increase of 20.7% compared to last year. The total expenditure this year will be 26,722,274,000 won, an increase of 35.9% compared to last year. Among them, the expenditure for developing the people's economy and social and cultural undertakings accounts for 61.3%; administrative expenses, national defense, and national security expenses account for 32%.

　　The results of last year's national budget execution are as follows: the total revenue was 20,900,100,000 won, and the expenditure was 19,657,000,000 won, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 1,244,400,000 won. Due to the implementation of the revised income tax decree, the tax rate for working people was reduced by an average of 19.7% last year. As a result, the income of workers, staff, and small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen increased by more than 500 million won.

　　Choi Chang-ik made a sharp contrast between the budgets of North and South Korea last year, saying: In last year's national budget of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the expenditure for developing the people's economy and social and cultural undertakings accounted for 61.5% of the total expenditure. In contrast, the "defense and police expenses" of the Syngman Rhee puppet government of South Korea accounted for 54.4% of the total expenditure last year, while the expenditure for social, cultural, and economic construction undertakings only accounted for 22%.

　　Choi Chang-ik finally pointed out: The task of this year's financial budget is to ensure the victorious completion of the two-year economic construction plan and consolidate the achievements of various democratic constructions in North Korea, so as to rapidly realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　After discussion, the meeting approved this year's budget案 and decided to issue 1.5 billion won in public bonds to make up for the financial balance deficit.

    去年国家预算执行的结果亿下：岁入总额为二百零九如零一百万元，岁出为一百九十六亿五千七百万元，岁入超过岁出十二亿四千四百万元。由于改订所得税政令的实施，去年，劳动人民的税率平均降低了百分之十九点七。工人、职员、中小工商业者因此而增加的收入达五亿元以上。
    崔昌益将北朝鲜与南朝鲜去年的预算作一鲜明对比说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国去年的国家预算中，用于发展人民经济与社会文化事业的费用，共占岁出总额的百分之六十一点五，与此相反，南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府的“国防军与警察费”去年就占了岁出总额的百分之五十四点四，而用于社会文化与经济建设事业的费用，则仅占百分之二十二。
    崔昌益最后指出：今年财政预算的任务，在于保证二年经济建设计划的胜利完成和巩固北朝鲜各项民主建设的成果，以迅速实现祖国的和平统一。
    会议在讨论后，通过了今年的预算案，并决定发行公债十五亿元，以弥补财政收支的差额。
