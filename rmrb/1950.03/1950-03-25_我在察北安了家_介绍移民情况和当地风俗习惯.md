　　I Settled Down in Chahar North
    ——Introducing the Situation of Immigrants and Local Customs
    Immigrant Xia Junfeng
    I was among the first batch of immigrants to Chahar North last October. I now live in Bulongwan Village, Shangdu County, Chahar North, living a happy rural life. I would like to introduce to everyone the living conditions after the move and the customs and practices of Chahar North. Before we set off, the Beijing Municipal People's Government provided clothing, hats, and quilts for the particularly impoverished immigrants; the Disaster Relief Committee also found ways to let us ride free trains, cars, and oxcarts all the way to our destination. There were reception stations along the way, and eating and lodging were not a problem. When we arrived at the village we were to live in, the village cadres and villagers warmly welcomed us, some plastering windows, cleaning houses, some lending furniture, and mobilizing food, vegetables, and firewood, as if they were entertaining relatives and friends, showing boundless sincerity and loving enthusiasm.

    Although the climate here is colder than Beijing, it is not as harsh as generally rumored. The local villagers are mostly immigrants from various provinces in North China, and they have developed a simple and honest style in Chahar North. Because they have been oppressed and exploited by feudal emperors and the Kuomintang for a long time, their cultural level is relatively low, and sanitation work is also a bit lacking. We immigrants from big cities have a duty to help the villagers there learn culture and improve sanitation. Although the practice of foot-binding, buying and selling, and arranged marriages for women in Chahar North has been greatly reduced since liberation, it has not been completely eliminated. The staple foods are mainly oat noodles, yams, and white flour. The technique of making oat noodles is unparalleled anywhere else, such as oat noodle nests, oat noodle balls, yam balls, and sticky cakes, with many varieties. Because the villagers eat oat noodles, which contain a lot of nutrients, and yams, which are rich in starch, the faces of men, women, old and young are rosy and healthy.

    The locals are not accustomed to planting trees, and timber is scarce, so they live in very small houses. Now the local People's Government is calling for tree planting and cultivating seedlings. I believe that in a few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Chahar North will surely be transformed from a desert area into a lush green field. The land here was originally very fertile yellow-black soil, but because of the influence of the desert, the surface is covered with a thin layer of sandy soil. This kind of land is most suitable for planting wheat, oats, flax, and rapeseed. If we improve agricultural technology, the yield will be almost the same as in Hebei Province. Last year, during the land reform, it was calculated that each person could get an average of twenty to thirty mu of arable land. There is also a lot of wasteland that can be reclaimed. During the land reform, most of the immigrants were allocated land and farm tools, and the government also provided loans for eleven months of food and is preparing to provide production capital for purchasing seeds and farm tools. As long as we work hard, there will be no problem with our lives, and things will get better day by day.

　　我在察北安了家
    ——介绍移民情况和当地风俗习惯
    移民  夏峻峰
    我是去年十月头一批到察北的移民。现住察北商都县补龙湾村。过着农村愉快的生活。我想把移居后的生活状况和察北的风俗人情介绍给大家。动身前，北京市人民政府对特别贫困的移民，发给了衣服、帽子、棉被；救灾委员会又给想办法让我们坐着免费的火车、汽车、牛车，一直就到了目的地。沿路有招待站，吃饭、住宿也都没有困难。到了移住的村子，村干部和老乡们热烈地欢迎我们，有的给糊窗户，打扫房子，有的借给家具，动员食粮、菜蔬、柴火，好像招待亲戚朋友一样，流露了无限诚恳友爱的热情。
    这里气候虽然比北京冷，但不像一般传说的那样厉害。当地的老乡，大部都是由华北各省移去的，到察北养成了一种诚朴厚实的作风。因为长期受封建帝王、国民党的压迫统治和剥削，文化水平比较低，卫生工作也差点。我们从大城市去的移民，就有义务帮助那里的老乡学习文化和改进卫生。察北妇女缠足、买卖包办式的婚姻制度解放后虽然大大减少了，但还没完全去掉。吃的大部为莜面、山药和白面。做莜面的技术是任何地方也比不了的，如莜面窝窝、莜面丸子、山药丸子、拿糕等，花样很多。老乡们因为吃的含着养分很多的莜面和淀粉最多的山药，男女老少脸上都是红润而健康的。
    当地不习惯植树，木材缺乏，住的都是很低小的房子。现在当地人民政府正号召植树，并培植树苗。相信几年以后，在共产党、人民政府的领导下，察北一定会由沙漠地带变成丛林茂盛的绿野的。这里的土地原来都是很肥的黄黑土，因为受到沙漠的影响，地面上盖了一层薄薄的沙土。这种地是最适宜种小麦、莜麦、胡麻和菜籽的。要把农业技术改进一下，与河北省的产量也差不多。去年土地改革时合计，每人平均可得耕地二十至三十亩。还有很多的荒地可以开垦。土地改革当中，大部移民分到了土地和农具，政府还贷给十一个月的食粮，并准备贷给购买种籽、农具的生产资本。只要我们好好劳动，生活是没问题的，光景会一天比一天好起来。
