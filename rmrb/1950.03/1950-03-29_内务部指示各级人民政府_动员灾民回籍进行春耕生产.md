The Ministry of Interior Instructs Governments at All Levels
    Mobilize Disaster Victims to Return Home for Spring Ploughing Production

    [This newspaper dispatch] This past year, many regions across the country suffered from natural disasters, and some places, due to the failure to organize production vigorously and promptly, experienced the phenomenon of disaster victims fleeing famine. As the spring ploughing season approaches, the Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government recently sent telegrams to governments at all levels in the Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South Major Administrative Areas, and North China's Five Provinces and Two Cities, requiring them to pay attention to organizing and assisting disaster victims in returning to their hometowns for spring ploughing. The telegram reads as follows: "According to a report from the Henan Provincial Government: disaster victims rushing to board trains from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou resulted in deaths. This is the result of a lack of organization in handling fleeing disaster victims. From now on, regarding the issue of transporting disaster victims, all localities should handle it in accordance with the following regulations: (1) Continue to adhere to the principle of self-reliance through production and oppose blindly fleeing famine. Those who must flee famine due to special circumstances should be transferred in an organized manner with the approval of the Prefectural Commissioner or higher-level government. (2) Local governments should make every effort to arrange production for disaster victims who have fled to various places. Those who need to be repatriated to their hometowns for spring ploughing should be repatriated in an organized manner in a timely manner. (3) For those who are repatriated in batches by local governments in an organized manner, the Ministry of Railways has agreed to purchase train tickets at a 30% discount. Train fares and living subsidies for disaster victims en route will be resolved by local governments under the disaster relief budget; individual areas with difficulties may report separately. Disaster victims who are able to solve part or all of their travel expenses should still be instructed to solve it themselves. (Approved)"

　　内务部指示各级人民政府
    动员灾民回籍进行春耕生产
    【本报讯】去年全国不少地区遭受了天灾，有些地方由于未及时大力组织生产，因此发生灾民逃荒现象。目前春耕节令已届，中央人民政府内务部于最近分电东北、西北、华东、中南各大行政区及华北五省两市各级人民政府必须注意组织帮助灾民返籍春耕。电文如下：“据河南省府报称：从郑州到徐州，灾民抢乘火车发生轧死人事件。这是对逃荒灾民处理缺乏组织性的结果。今后关于输送灾民问题各地应按以下规定办理：（一）仍坚持生产自救原则，反对盲目逃荒。有特殊情况必须逃荒者，经专署以上政府批准，有组织的进行迁移。（二）已逃亡各地之灾民，当地政府应尽量安置其生产，其须遣送回籍春耕者，应及时有组织的遣送。（三）凡经地方政府成批有组织的遣送者，铁道部已同意按七折购火车票。火车费及灾民途中生产补助费，各地在救济事业费项下自行解决；个别地区有困难者，可另行呈报。灾民中有力解决路费者，仍应令其自行解决一部或全部。（准）
