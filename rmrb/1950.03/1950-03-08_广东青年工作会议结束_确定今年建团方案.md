Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 3rd. The Guangdong Youth Work Conference, convened by the Youth Work Committee of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, concluded on February 15th. The conference lasted eleven days, with the participation of more than 40 youth work cadres from various CCP district and municipal committees. The conference conveyed the resolution of the Guangdong Party Representatives Conference of the CCP regarding the tasks of Guangdong work in 1950 and the decision of the CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau to strengthen the work of the Communist Youth League; and heard reports on the work situation in various regions. The conference formulated the Guangdong Province's plan for building the League in 1950. The plan pointed out that the Communist Youth League organizations throughout the province already have more than 31,100 members. These members played an active role in the pre-liberation rural armed struggle and urban underground struggle, as well as in various mass movements after liberation, such as assisting the People's Government in carrying out takeover work, responding to the call of the People's Government, and carrying out the New Democracy study movement, becoming a strong assistant to the government.

The plan pointed out: The current task of the Communist Youth League is to mobilize and educate all members and unite the broad masses of young people, resolutely work hard to complete the resolutions of the Guangdong Party Representatives Conference of the CCP; implement the Party's policy on building the League, with the Party and the League working together to establish a province-wide Communist Youth League organization in a step-by-step manner, and develop a large number of League members; and establish Young Pioneers teams. In terms of leadership, it is necessary to quickly establish and improve leadership organizations at all levels and cultivate cadres, especially to quickly cultivate worker-peasant cadres. In terms of work style, it is necessary to overcome the tendency towards closed-doorism and the practice of secretly developing League members that are prevalent in various regions; at the same time, formalism and the practice of forced recruitment should also be opposed. At present, the targets for developing League members should be mainly young workers in cities, but also should appropriately attach importance to shop assistants' work and continue to strengthen students' work; in rural areas, the leadership of poor and lower-middle peasant youth should be strengthened, and attention should be paid to developing and educating female League members in rural areas. In addition, there are many overseas Chinese youth from Guangdong residing abroad, and it is necessary to strengthen contact with them.

The plan stipulates that this year's Communist Youth League members' study plan includes: (1) Studying "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" systematically; (2) Studying internationalism and patriotism, focusing on materials on Sino-Soviet friendship and opposition to the colonial system; (3) Studying class viewpoints and policies, focusing on the land reform issue; (4) Cultivating a revolutionary outlook on life through the study of loving the motherland and loving labor. The above studies must mobilize the broad masses of young people to participate together.

　　广东青年工作会议结束
    确定今年建团方案
    【新华社广州三日电】中共中央华南分局青年工作委员会召开的广东省青年工作会议，已于二月十五日闭幕。会议历时十一天，参加会议的有中共各地委、市委青年工作干部四十余人。会议传达了中共广东党代表会议关于一九五零年广东工作任务的决议和中共中央中南局加强青年团工作的决定；并听取了各地工作情况汇报。会议作出了广东省一九五零年的建团方案。方案指出：现在全省各地青年团的组织已经拥有团员三万一千一百余人。这些团员在解放前的农村武装斗争和城市地下斗争以及解放后的各种群众运动中，如协助人民政府进行接管工作、响应人民政府的号召和开展新民主主义的学习运动等都起了积极的作用，成为政府有力的助手。
    方案指出：青年团目前的任务是动员和教育全体团员和团结广大青年，坚决为完成中共广东党代表会议的决议而努力工作；贯彻党关于建团的方针，党和团一起动手，有步骤地建立全省规模的青年团组织，大量发展团员；并建立少年儿童队。在领导方面，必须迅速建立和健全各级领导机构以及培养干部，特别要迅速培养工农干部。在工作作风上必须克服现在各地普遍存在的关门主义的偏向和秘密发展团员的作风；同时也反对形式主义和拉夫凑数的办法。目前发展团员的对象，在城市中以青年工人为主，同时也应适当地重视店员工作和继续加强学生工作；在农村中应加强贫雇农青年的领导，并注意发展和教育农村中的女团员。此外，广东侨居国外的华侨青年很多，必须加强和他们的联系。
    方案规定了今年青年团团员学习计划为：（一）有系统地学习《中国革命与中国共产党》；（二）以中苏友好和反对殖民制度的材料为中心，学习国际主义与爱国主义；（三）以土地改革问题为中心，学习阶级观点和政策；（四）从爱祖国、爱劳动的学习中，培养革命人生观。以上学习必须动员广大青年群众一起来进行。
