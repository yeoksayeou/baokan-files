　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th - TASS, New York, February 27th: American newspaper reports show that the American people yearn for peace and increasingly insist on negotiations with the Soviet Union in order to peacefully resolve differences. The anti-Soviet newspaper, the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," admitted in a dispatch from Washington that a large number of letters demanding peace continue to flood Congress. According to the newspaper's report, it can be concluded that some members of Congress whose terms expire in 1950 are trying to exploit the American people's desire for peace for their own selfish interests and plan to criticize the US government during the election campaign for its "unwillingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union."

　　美国人民渴望和平  坚持要求与苏谈判
    大批要求和平的信件涌进国会
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国报纸消息显示：美国人民渴望和平并愈益坚持地要求与苏联进行谈判，以期和平解决歧见。反苏的报纸《纽约世界电讯——太阳报》华盛顿的电讯承认，大批要求和平的信件继续涌进国会。根据该报的报道，可以得出一个结论，即：某些任期在一九五○年届满的国会议员，正设法利用美国人民对和平的渴望遂其一己私利，并打算在竞选期间批评美国政府“不愿与苏联谈判”。
