Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 29th: The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee, in order to implement the State Council's "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work," specially convened an eight-day Northwest Financial Conference from the 18th to the 25th of this month.

　　On the first day of the conference, Jia Tuofu, director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee, conveyed the Central People's Government State Council's "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work." Subsequently, Xi Zhongxun, vice chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, gave a speech. He elaborated in detail on the main aspects of improving financial and economic work in the Northwest, such as reorganizing institutions, practicing strict economy, strengthening tax collection, and establishing various new systems in accordance with the State Council's decision. On the second day of the conference, responsible financial and economic cadres from various provinces and cities spoke, reviewing the undesirable ideas and work styles in past local financial and economic work that were inconsistent with the central decision, and actively put forward suggestions for improvement. From the third to the seventh day of the conference, various specific plans for implementing unified financial and economic work were discussed, formulated, and adopted. The conference focused on discussing the Northwest Region's revenue and expenditure issues for the current year, and re-formulated the revenue and expenditure budget for the current year. On the revenue side, based on careful calculation, the conference specifically arranged the specific figures for various income items such as tax revenue, public grain, public bonds, and depreciation profits of factories and enterprises in various regions. On the expenditure side, based on the principle of "reducing expenditures and focusing on key uses," the conference formulated a plan for the allocation and use of various operating funds. Regarding culture and education, the conference decided to carry out necessary reforms on the existing basis, reducing or merging school institutions to improve quality. Health, news, culture, publishing, and other institutions should implement fixed staffing and quotas, and cultural troupes and public hospitals should gradually move towards enterprise management. The policy for investment and loans in cooperative and agricultural and forestry undertakings is to "focus on key distribution and earmark funds for specific purposes." Investment and loans for water conservancy should focus on the existing water conservancy projects in the Northwest provinces, with a view to achieving rapid results. Regarding urban construction funds, the focus will be on Xi'an and Lanzhou, while also taking care of the necessary repair funds for cities such as Xining, Yinchuan, and Dihua. Specific provisions were also made for civil affairs, judicial and other operating expenses, and depreciation profits of factories and enterprises. In order to reduce expenditure, the conference decided that local financial authorities should conduct a review of the household affairs of various agencies, conduct systematic adjustments, supervise their use, and not allow them to exceed the standards. In addition, the conference also formulated preliminary implementation measures for reorganizing institutions, verifying personnel, unifying supply management, clearing warehouses, strengthening grain depot standards, financial systems, unifying revenue and expenditure, and implementing financial supervision.

　　On the last day of the conference, Jia Tuofu made a concluding report. He pointed out that the major achievement of this conference was the reformulation of the 1950 revenue and expenditure budget for the Northwest Region. On the revenue side, the new budget increased by about 8 percent compared with the old budget; on the expenditure side, the new budget was reduced by more than 40 percent compared with the old budget. This change in figures reduced the Northwest Region's fiscal deficit from 70 percent of the old budget to 40 percent of the new budget, greatly reducing the state's financial burden. This is the result of implementing unified financial and economic work, correcting the waste of state property, and conducting meticulous research and discussion. He went on to point out that last year's public grain and tax tasks were not fully completed. These outstanding arrears must be stepped up to be recovered in order to be stored in warehouses. He emphasized that in order to overcome past waste phenomena and implement the new revenue and expenditure budget, it is necessary to grasp the three major keys of guaranteeing income, saving expenditure, and unified management, and strictly enforce discipline and strengthen learning in order to realize the decision of unified national financial and economic work. Subsequently, the heads of financial and economic work in various provinces and cities successively spoke. They unanimously expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties and ensure the implementation of the conference's resolutions. Finally, Xi Zhongxun, vice chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, spoke. He called on the leading organs in various regions to take practical responsibility, implement the decisions of the conference, and establish a strong foundation for carrying out all future work.

　　贯彻国家财经统一决定
    西北区召开财政会议
    【新华社西安二十九日电】西北区财政经济委员会为贯彻政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，特在本月十八日至二十五日召开了历时八天的西北财政会议。
    会议第一日，由西北财经委员会主任贾拓夫传达中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”。继由西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋讲话。他对改进西北财经工作的主要内容如整编机构、厉行节约、加强税收工作，以及根据政务院的决定建立各种新制度等问题阐述甚详。会议第二日，由与会各省市财经负责干部发言，检讨了过去各地方财经工作中与中央决定不符的不良思想和作风，并积极提出改进意见。会议第三日至第七日，讨论、制定并通过了执行统一财经工作的各项具体方案。会议着重讨论了西北区本年度收支问题，重新制定了本年度收支概算。收入方面，会议根据精打细算的结果，具体布置了各地税收、公粮、公债、工厂企业折旧利润等项收入的具体数字。支出方面，会议根据“缩减开支，重点使用”的原则，制定了各项事业经费分配使用的方案。关于文教方面，会议决定在现有基础上进行必要的改革，缩减或合并学校机构，提高质量。卫生、新闻、文化、出版等机构应实行定员定额，文工团和公立医院应逐渐走向企业化。对于合作和农林事业的投资贷款，方针是“重点发放，专款专用”。水利事业的投资贷款，以兴修西北各省已有基础的水利工程为主，以期迅速收效。关于城市建设费，重点放在西安和兰州两地，同时并照顾西宁、银川、迪化等市必要的补修费。对于民政、司法等事业费和工厂企业的折旧利润，也都作了具体规定。为减缩开支，会议决定，各地财政机关对各机关家务实施清查，进行有系统的调整，在用途上加以监督，不准超过标准。此外，会议关于整编机构、核实人马、统一供给管理、清理仓库、加强粮库标准、财务制度、统一收支和实行财政监督等方面，都订出了初步的实施办法。
    会议最后一日，由贾拓夫作总结报告。他指出这次会议的重大收获是重新制定了一九五○年西北区的收支概算。在收入方面，新的预算比旧的预算增加了百分之八左右；在支出方面，新预算却比旧预算减少了百分之四十以上。此项数字的变化，使一九五○年西北区的财政赤字由旧概算的百分之七十减为新概算的百分之四十，大大减少了国家的财政负担。这是实行统一财经工作，纠正浪费国家财产，缜密研究和讨论的结果。他接着指出：去年的公粮和税收任务均未全部完成。这些尾欠必须加紧追收，以便入仓入库。他强调说：要克服过去的浪费现象，贯彻执行新的收支概算，必须掌握保证收入、节约支出和统一管理的三大关键，并严格执行纪律，加强学习，为实现统一国家财经工作的决定而努力。继由与会各省、市财经工作负责人相继发言。他们一致表示决心克服一切困难，保证执行会议的决议。会议最后由西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋讲话。他号召各地领导机关，切实负责，贯彻实行会议的决定，为今后开展一切工作建立有力的基础。
