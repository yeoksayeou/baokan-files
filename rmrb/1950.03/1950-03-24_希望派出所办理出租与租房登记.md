　　Hoping Police Stations Will Handle Rental and Housing Registration
    In order to solve the problem of tenants not being able to find housing and landlords having houses to rent but no tenants, I think it would be best for landlords who want to rent out houses to declare the number of vacant rooms, their location, and rental conditions to the nearby public security police station. Those who want to rent a house can directly inquire at each police station. This would be a win-win situation.

　　希望派出所办理出租与租房登记
    为解决房客觅房不得、房主有房欲租无客的情况，我觉得最好由欲出租的房主向附近公安派出所声报空房数量，坐落地点及其出租条件，愿租房者可径向各派出所询问。这会是一举两利的。        （读者  东如）
