Xinhua News Agency: Radio Speeches by Three Soviet Scholars
　　[Xinhua News Agency] Three Soviet scholars, Dr. Nuzhdin, Dr. Giselev, and Ms. Makarova, who have come to China to lecture, gave radio speeches on the Central People’s Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 12th. The speeches are as follows:

　　I. Speech by Dr. Nuzhdin
　　Dear friends:
　　I am very happy and excited to convey the brotherly greetings of Soviet scholars and Soviet intellectuals to the Chinese people.

　　My comrades and I have come to China to introduce the achievements of Soviet science to Chinese scholars, to report to them how Soviet science is connected with practice, how it helps our socialist economy, and how it helps it develop rapidly and smoothly. At the same time, we also want to understand your country’s science and the lives of the Chinese people, so that we can report to the Soviet people after we return to our country how the Chinese people are building a new life in the already liberated People's Republic.

　　In the thirty-two years of the Soviet regime, Soviet biological science has made great achievements and has become the most advanced science in the world. Its greatest achievement is that it has become a truly people's science. It works for the people and with the people. Michurin biological science has solved the most complex theoretical problems for the sake of practice, for the sake of agricultural production, for its improvement and development. This is why the Soviet people love Michurin science so much, and the people's love and respect for it is the highest evaluation of a scholar's work. Every scientific worker should cherish this love and respect.

　　After Michurin science understood the laws of nature, it put forward the basic task, which is to transform nature in a planned way for the benefit of the people. This science is named after a great Soviet scholar, Michurin. Michurin once wrote: "We cannot wait for the gifts of nature. To fight for it from nature, that is our task." Michurin science is realizing this task, creating new plant varieties and new animal breeds that are better than the old ones. Now the Soviet Union is carrying out a very large-scale work to realize Stalin's plan for transforming nature. In the steppe areas of the European part of Russia, there are more than 800,000 collective farms. In this vast area, people are planting windbreak forest belts and building artificial reservoirs. With these measures, people can be freed from the domination of nature, people will not be threatened by periodic droughts, and people can be guaranteed regular and stable harvests. The entire Soviet people are participating in this grand work that has never been seen in the world before. Soviet collective farmers and scholars, old people and children, are all doing this common cause, implementing Stalin's great plan to transform nature. Only in a country where the working people hold power, only in a country where science and labor are free, only in a country where people work and build for themselves and for improving their lives, is it possible to realize such a difficult and ambitious task.

　　Dear friends! You have already begun to build a new China. You are building a free People's Republic. I sincerely congratulate you on your great success in your work!

　　II. Speech by Dr. Giselev
　　Dear citizens of the People's Republic of China!

　　On behalf of the Soviet scholars and researchers of historical science, I salute you!

　　We are very fortunate to have been invited by the General Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to come to your country to tell you about the work of Soviet scholars, academic institutions, and universities.

　　Historical science occupies a very important position in Soviet scientific research because Marxism-Leninism believes that mastering the laws of social development and the laws of history is a completely practical task. It is necessary to accurately define the direction of the historical process, and to correctly and scientifically guide, improve, and progressively transform the historical process for the benefit of the working people.

　　Soviet historical science is completely opposite to bourgeois science. Among the historians in capitalist countries, most of them want to use the method of falsifying history to prove that the exploitation of the working people by landlords and capitalists is eternal and unchanging, and they try to falsely prove that capitalism is unshakable.

　　On the contrary, Soviet historical scientists faithfully analyze many historical events and prove that the capitalist system is temporary. In the capitalist system, many class contradictions have arisen, and these contradictions are leading the capitalist society to destruction, while at the same time leading socialism to development and victory. The existence of socialism in the Soviet Union and the smooth transition to socialism in various people's democratic countries brilliantly prove the correctness of Soviet historical science on this major issue that is closely related to the life and death of the working people. Soviet historical science proves that the capitalist system is doomed to destruction, and the growing contradictions, poverty, hunger, and increasingly terrible signs of economic crises in various capitalist countries also clearly prove the correctness of Soviet historical science.

　　Among the historians in capitalist countries, the so-called "theories" of hatred for humanity, the so-called "theories" of a few "superior" races dominating all backward humans, are becoming more and more popular. This theory cannot explain the progressive development of history, and it is used by imperialist pseudo-scholars to defend the eternal slave system and eternal colonial exploitation. Here, not only the people of Asia, Africa, and Australia, but also the people of Europe are destined by those Anglo-American historians to live a life of colonies and vassal states.

　　On the contrary, Soviet historians sincerely respect the independence of all nations.

　　Soviet historians, understanding the laws of historical development, try their best to explain the reasons that hinder the rapid development of a certain nation, and thus, take finding ways to overcome these obstacles as their main task. They believe that the path and speed of historical development of all nations are not determined by illusory racial differences, but by the socio-economic characteristics in history.

　　Soviet historians are now excitedly studying Chinese history, and they regard China as their great friendly neighbor, which is moving forward on the road of liberation and progress. Soviet historians hope that their ordinary efforts can be of some help to the greatest cause of our time—the construction of the new China and the struggle for peace and democracy.

　　III. Speech by Ms. Makarova
　　Dear friends!

　　We traveled for eleven days and nights to come to your country. We have left our motherland so far away, but we do not feel lonely because of it. Because we have received warm reception and friendship from the Chinese people and society.

　　We understand each other very well. The long and far distance from Moscow to Beijing, and the huge differences in language, are not an obstacle to laying a strong friendship relationship for people engaged in a common cause. The common cause of the two great nations of the Soviet Union and China is to strive for world peace and the happiness of mankind.

　　For many years, the Soviet Union has been the only socialist country surrounded by capitalism. We have had many difficulties. However, when overcoming these difficulties, the Soviet people always firmly remembered their obligations to the people of the world. The Soviet people have bravely and resolutely pioneered the road of struggle and victory for the people of other countries. The Soviet people are developing the economy and increasing the wealth of the socialist motherland, and therefore, this is also a struggle for the cause of world peace and progress.

　　Now, the forces of democracy and socialism have grown immensely. The great new China has stood up and joined the ranks of countries building a new society.

　　The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, defeated the imperialists and the domestic enemies—the Kuomintang reactionaries, and won a historic victory. Now the Chinese people are facing new and difficult tasks, which are to develop the economy and build a new society.

　　The Soviet people pointed out a road to the people of other countries. They know how to build a new life, how to fight, and what difficulties they will encounter. The Soviet people are watching the struggle of the Chinese people with brotherly concern, and are happy for the victory of the Chinese people together with the Chinese people.

　　We, the Soviet scientific workers who have come to China to lecture, send you our warm greetings and celebrate your new and great success in striving for peace and building a new life.

　　苏联三学者广播讲词
    【新华社讯】到我国来讲学的三位苏联学者努日金博士、吉谢列夫博士和马卡洛娃硕士，十二日晚在中央人民广播电台广播演讲，讲词如下：
    一、努日金博士讲词亲爱的朋友们：
    我十分快乐和兴奋地转达苏联学者和苏维埃知识分子向中国人民的兄弟般的敬礼。
    我和我的同志们来到中国，是为了向中国的学者们介绍苏联科学的成就，向他们报告苏联科学怎样联系实际，怎样帮助我们的社会主义经济，帮助它迅速而顺利地发展起来。同时，我们也想了解贵国的科学，了解中国人民的生活，为的回国以后，向苏联人民报告中国人民在已经获得的人民共和国里面怎样建设新的生活。
    在苏维埃政权三十二年的时期里面，苏联的生物科学得到了巨大的成就，已经成为世界上最先进的科学。它的最大的成就，是它已经成为真正人民的科学了，它是为人民而工作，同人民在一起工作，米邱林生物科学解决了最复杂的理论问题，它是为了实践，为了农业生产，为了它的提高和发展，这就是苏联人民为什么这样爱护米邱林科学的原因，而人民的爱护和对它的尊重，乃是对一个学者的工作的最高评价。每一个科学工作者都应该很珍贵这种爱护和尊重。
    米邱林科学认识了自然界的规律以后，就提出了基本的任务，这个任务就是为了人民的利益而有计划地改造自然。这门科学是以苏联的一个伟大学者的名字——米邱林起名的。米邱林曾经写过：“我们不能等待自然界的恩赐。向自然界去争取，这才是我们的任务。”米邱林科学正在实现这个任务，它创造了新的植物品种，新的动物品种，这些品种都比旧的好。现在苏联正在进行一项很巨大的工作，实现斯大林改造自然的计划。俄罗斯欧洲部分草原地带有八十万以上的集体农场，在这个广阔的区域里，人民正在栽种防风森林地带，建筑人工蓄水池。用这些措施，就可以使人们摆脱自然界的支配，使人们不受定期旱灾的威胁，可以保障人们获得经常而稳定的收获。全体苏联人民正在参加这个全世界从来没有过的规模宏大的工作。苏联的集体农民和学者们，老人和小孩子们，都在做这件共同的事业，实行斯大林的改造自然的伟大计划。只有在劳动人民掌握政权的国家里，只有在科学和劳动都是自由的国家里，只有在人们为了自己、为了改善自己的生活而工作和建设的国家里，才有可能实现这样规模艰巨和目的伟大的任务。
    亲爱的朋友们！你们已经开始建设新的中国了。你们正在建设自由的人民共和国。我衷心祝贺你们工作上的巨大的成功！
    二、吉谢列夫博士讲词亲爱的中华人民共和国的公民们！
    我代表苏联的学者，历史科学研究者们，向你们致敬！
    我们很幸运，承中苏友好协会总会的邀请，来到贵国，向你们讲述苏维埃学者、学术机关和高等学校的工作。
    历史科学在苏维埃的科学研究当中，占有很重要的地位，因为马列主义认为：必须掌握社会发展规律，掌握历史规律，乃是一个完全实际的任务。为了完全确切地规定历史过程的方向，为了正确地、科学地指导、改良、和进步地改造历史进程，以谋劳动人民群众的利益，这是需要的。
    苏维埃历史科学是和资产阶级的科学完全相反的。在资本主义国家的历史学家里面，大部分都想用伪造历史的方法来证明：地主和资本家剥削劳动人民是永恒不变的，都企图虚伪地证明资本主义是不能动摇的。
    相反的，苏联历史科学家们，忠实地分析了历史上的许多事件，证明：资本主义制度是暂时性的。在资本主义制度当中，产生了许多阶级矛盾，这些矛盾正在使资本主义社会走向毁灭，而同时使社会主义走向发展和胜利。社会主义在苏联的存在和各人民民主国家的顺利走向社会主义，辉煌地证明了苏维埃历史科学，在这个和劳动人民生死相关的重大问题上的正确。苏维埃历史科学证明：资本主义制度是要毁灭的，而现在各资本主义国家矛盾的增长、贫困、饥饿、以及经济危机的日益增长的可怕的征候，也明显地证明了苏维埃历史科学的正确。
    在资本主义各国的历史学家里面，那种仇恨人类的所谓“理论”，所谓少数“优秀”种族、统治一切落后人类的“理论”，愈来愈流行了。这种理论是不能说明历史的进步发展的，它被帝国主义假学者们用来辩护永远的奴隶制度、永远的殖民地剥削。在这里，不但亚洲、非洲和澳洲的人民，而且还有欧洲的人民，都被那些英美历史学家们注定去过殖民地的、附庸国的生活。
    相反的，苏联的历史学家们，是真心诚意地尊重各国民族的独立的。
    苏维埃的历史学家们，理解了历史发展的规律，尽力说明阻碍某一民族迅速发展的原因，从而，把寻找克服这些阻碍的方法，作为自己的主要任务。他们认为：各国人民历史发展的道路和速度，不是由幻想的种族上的差别来决定的，而是由历史中社会经济的特点来决定的。
    苏维埃的历史学家们，现在正在兴奋地研究中国历史，他们把中国看作自己的伟大的友邦，而这个友邦正在循着解放和进步的大道迈进。苏维埃的历史学家们，希望他们的平凡的努力，对我们这个时代的最伟大的事业——对新中国的建设，对争取和平和民主的战士，能够有所帮助。
    三、马卡洛娃硕士讲词亲爱的朋友们！
    我们来到贵国，曾经在路上走了十一个昼夜。我们离开祖国，已经这样远，但是我们并没有因此感到寂寞。因为我们从中国人民和社会方面，得到了热烈的招待和友情。
    我们彼此都很了解。从莫斯科到北京的又长又远的距离，和语言上的巨大区别，对于从事于共同事业的人们奠定坚强的友谊关系，并不是一种阻碍。苏联和中国这两大民族的共同事业，就是争取全世界的和平和人类的幸福。
    多少年以来，苏联曾经是唯一的被资本主义包围的社会主义国家。我们曾经是很困难的。但是，苏联人民在克服这些困难的时候，总是牢牢地记着自己对全世界人民应尽的义务。苏联人民曾经为其他各国人民英勇果敢地开拓了斗争和胜利的道路。苏联人民正在发展经济、增加社会主义祖国的财富，因此，这也就是为全世界的和平与进步事业而斗争。
    现在，民主和社会主义的力量已经无比地壮大了。伟大的新中国，已经站立起来，加入了建设新社会的国家的行列。
    伟大的中国人民，在共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导之下，战胜了帝国主义者和本国敌人——国民党反动派，而赢得了历史性的胜利。现在中国人民面临着新的、困难的任务，这就是发展经济和建设新社会。
    苏维埃人民，给其他各国人民指出了一条道路，他们知道：要建设新的生活，要怎样进行斗争，和会遇到什么样的困难，苏联人民正以兄弟般的关怀，注视中国人民的斗争。并且和中国人民一起，为中国人民的胜利而高兴。
    我们来到中国讲学的苏联科学工作者，向你们致热烈的敬礼，并且庆祝你们取争和平与建设新生活的新的、巨大的成功。
