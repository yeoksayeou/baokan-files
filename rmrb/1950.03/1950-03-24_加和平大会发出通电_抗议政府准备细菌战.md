Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, March 21st, via the Electric Communication Society: The agenda of the "scientists'" conference of the United States, Britain, and Canada held in Ottawa from March 15th to 17th reveals that the Canadian government is developing methods of bacteriological warfare. The Canada Peace Congress, therefore, through its secretary, sent a telegram to Prime Minister Laurent, Foreign Minister Pearson, and Defense Minister Claxton, stating that all peace-loving Canadians oppose the government's development of bacteriological warfare methods and demanding that the Canadian government "immediately destroy all existing toxins and poisons that massively exterminate humans, livestock, and grains." The telegram declared: "We have notified peace movements in sixty-nine countries to be vigilant against the heinous threat posed by the Canadian government to the safety of the people of all nations."

In its protest telegram, the Canada Peace Congress condemned the Canadian government's germ warfare plan as a violation of the United Nations Charter. "We point out that the manufacture of bacteriological weapons for the mass slaughter of civilians violates the United Nations Charter, which prohibits mass slaughter, and of which Canada is a signatory." Copies of the telegram were also sent to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie and Dr. A. E. Thompson, Chairman of the Canada Peace Congress. The Canada Peace Congress is now receiving protest letters and telegrams from all over Canada.

The Canadian Labor News Agency reported that at the Ottawa conference, Canadian "bacteriological warfare" experts presented their secrets to representatives from Washington and London. Newspaper reports announced that the conference also discussed "chemical, polar, psychological, and other forms of warfare." The Canadian Press also acknowledged that the Canadian government has a chemical warfare laboratory near Suffield, Alberta.

　　加和平大会发出通电
    抗议政府准备细菌战
    【新华社二十三日讯】据电通社多伦多二十一日讯：三月十五至十七日在渥太华举行的美英加三国“科学家”会议的议程，透露出加拿大政府在发展细菌战争的方法。加拿大和平大会为此特经由该会秘书致电总理劳伦特、外交部长皮尔逊和国防部长克莱克斯顿，表示一切爱好和平的加拿大人民都反对政府发展细菌战的方法，并要求加拿大政府“立即销毁一切现存的大规模消灭人类、家畜与五谷的毒素毒物”。电文宣称：“我们已通知六十九国和平运动组织，警惕加拿大政府使所有国家人民的安全遭到的可恶的威胁。”
    加拿大和平大会在其抗议通电中谴责加拿大政府的病菌战争计划违反联合国宪章。“我们指出，制造大规模屠杀平民的细菌武器，违反了禁止大规模屠杀的联合国宪章，而加拿大乃正是联合国的签字国之一”。电文的副本也分别送给联合国秘书长赖伊和加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士。加和平大会现正收到加拿大各地发来的抗议函电。
    加拿大劳工通讯社报道，在渥太华会议中，加拿大“细菌战”专家曾把他们的秘密献给华盛顿与伦敦的代表。报纸消息宣布，该会议并讨论了“化学、极地、心理学以及其他各种形式的战争”。加拿大通讯社并承认加政府在阿尔倍达省萨非尔德附近设有化学战争实验室。
