Voters in Moscow's Stalin electoral district voted for the great leader Stalin with immense enthusiasm. Voters wrote moving inscriptions on their ballots: "Glory to Stalin!" "Thanks to the father and mentor—our own Stalin!". Young people participating in the vote for the first time wrote: "I am honored because I cast a ballot with your beloved name!". The ballots also contained snowball flowers, the first to bloom in spring. At the Thirteenth Electoral Precinct in the Stalin electoral district, 1,584 voters from Siberia, the Far East, Uzbekistan, and Tartary also cast their votes.
