　　Last year, many regions across the country suffered significant natural disasters. Due to the long-term exploitation by the Kuomintang bandit gangs and the Japanese imperialist aggression against China, the people's lives were extremely painful and lacked the ability to resist disasters. Furthermore, during the period of Japanese invasion and the Kuomintang's civil war, the already dilapidated embankments suffered severe damage, greatly reducing their flood control effectiveness. For these reasons, the disaster situation in some areas was very serious.

　　From the outset, governments at all levels led the people in fighting against the disaster. During the spring and summer droughts, the people's government led the people to fight the drought, plant seeds, and extinguish pests. When floods arrived, the people's government led the people in an all-out effort to rescue and protect the embankments. The Yellow River's flow exceeded that of any previous year, and all cadres of governments at all levels along the river went to the embankments, braving the rain to rescue the embankments alongside the farmers. They fought bravely and finally brought down the water's momentum, preventing breaches. Although some areas were flooded due to excessive water flow, excessive rainfall, and especially irresistible typhoons, various rescue efforts greatly reduced the severity of the disaster. After the flood season, the people's government called on and organized the masses to drain water and plant wheat, proposing slogans such as "Minor interests must give way to major interests, low-lying areas must give way to high-lying areas, and downstream areas must give way to upstream areas." The wheat planting area in each province reached more than 80% of the flooded land. This ensured that the disaster period could be shortened.

　　After the establishment of the Central People's Government, it successively issued instructions on production and disaster relief, instructing the affected areas to focus on production and disaster relief as the central task. The slogan "Do not let a single person starve to death" was put forward, and three inspection teams were sent to northern Jiangsu, Pingyuan, and Hebei to inspect the disaster situation and disaster relief work. Local areas also successively established production and disaster relief committees. Responsible cadres in some provinces went deep into the disaster areas to personally supervise disaster relief work, and some even transferred a large number of cadres to organize working committees (or working groups) in severely affected areas, stationed permanently in the disaster areas to direct disaster relief work. Our disaster relief policy is: production for self-salvation, thrift to overcome the famine, mutual assistance among the masses, work-for-relief, supplemented by necessary relief. All localities have carried out work in accordance with this policy. This work includes the following:

　　First, vigorously develop sideline production. In developing sideline production, the slogan "Rely on the mountains if you live near them, rely on the water if you live near it" was put forward, and mutual assistance among the masses, free lending, and turning dead money into living money were advocated to solve the difficulty of lack of funds. For producers, the method of lending grain first and then collecting finished products was adopted; for transporters, the method of lending goods first and then collecting payment was adopted. Local trade companies and supply and marketing cooperatives signed contracts with various parties to promote local products. For example, Hebei Province signed a contract with the Central Trade Department for lending 120 million jin of coarse grains in exchange for fine grains, with the Trade Department paying coarse grains first and then collecting fine grains after the wheat harvest. The province also signed contracts with the Central Cooperative Affairs Bureau for the purchase of 50 million square feet of native cloth and 30 million jin of saltpeter, and with the Northeast for the purchase of 500,000 jin of saltpeter. Pingyuan, Shandong, and other places are also in the process of establishing ordering contracts. This allows sideline production in various localities to be carried out in a more planned manner.

　　Secondly, is work-for-relief, using the labor of disaster victims to engage in construction. Northern Jiangsu set out a three-year plan for water conservancy construction, with the allocation of grain reaching 230 million jin in the first year. This great water management project not only solves the problem of disaster relief but is also a major construction project for northern Jiangsu. The People's Representative Conference of all circles in northern Anhui passed a resolution on vigorously building water conservancy projects, and the government's allocation of work-for-relief and relief grain has reached 270 million jin. Shandong's water conservancy and Yellow River management projects have been allocated 120 million jin of grain this year. Pingyuan allocated 30 million jin of grain for Yellow River management. The Central South Region allocated 400 million jin of grain, most of which was used for work-for-relief and relief in disaster areas. Whenever possible, projects that can be undertaken by disaster victims should employ disaster victims as much as possible. This is an active disaster relief method, and all localities have achieved great results.

　　In addition, is the implementation of thrift, calling on disaster victims to grow vegetables and collect wild vegetables to replace grain. Local government staff and the People's Liberation Army automatically carried out a movement to save one or two liang of rice, and some agencies even saved four or five liang of grain per person per day, and some cadres took out all their subsidies to relieve disaster victims. Relief donations were carried out in major cities, and a "bowl of rice for disaster relief" movement was carried out in rural areas. Hebei Province alone raised 12.5 million jin of relief grain. The central government and major administrative regions also re-allocated large amounts of grain to support production and relief in disaster areas. The central government approved the allocation of 35 million jin of emergency relief grain and relief grain in the North China Region. We also plan to transport grain from the Northeast, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, and from Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi to regulate food supplies.

　　The above is a general overview of the disaster relief work we have done. With the efforts of cadres and the broad masses of the people, we have successfully overcome the severe winter famine.

　　(2)

　　However, the disaster has only been overcome by half or most, and the serious situation has not yet passed. We are currently in the spring famine season. As the saying goes, "Disasters fear the tail, not the head." Any negligence will cause trouble. Experience has proven that our disaster relief work relies entirely on strengthening leadership, conducting in-depth inspections, organizing disaster victims, self-salvation through production, careful calculations, thrift and mutual assistance to make up for the difficulties of lack of materials and inconvenient transportation. We have done this in the past, and we are still doing it now, but the depth and breadth of our work are still not enough. The bureaucratic tendencies among cadres in many places are still quite serious: such as not caring enough about disaster victims, not going deep into the disaster areas; lacking confidence in self-salvation through production, fearing difficulties, and simply waiting for relief; having arrangements for work but no inspection, simply moving the instructions of higher authorities without studying the specific situation, only shouting slogans without being good at organizing the masses, etc. Disaster relief work is a series, from dike protection and rescue, water drainage and wheat planting, organization of sideline occupations, promotion of finished products, thrift and mutual aid, emergency relief, to the arrangement of spring plowing, no link can be isolated, no moment can be relaxed. Many places have done this, but in some areas, there have been deviations. After draining water and planting wheat, they started to promote sideline production later, resulting in blind fleeing. Or, sideline production has been carried out, but finished products cannot be sold, and the disaster victims are still not helped, resulting in a large number of draught animals being sold or killed, which is a great loss to the human and animal resources in the disaster area. If they are not rescued quickly, it will affect spring plowing. Some have not conducted in-depth investigation and research, generalizing special problems. Some have confused the numbers of "perennial grain shortage" with "grain needed for disaster relief" and "emergency relief grain" with "relief grain." Some have raised all the problems to the central government for resolution, rather than realistically and accurately calculating how much central government assistance is needed to save the disaster victims. Some areas make unrealistic reports. For example, Hebei originally reported that 650,000 people were lying down and urgently needed relief, but according to the inspection team in the disaster area, this was by no means the case. Chahar originally wanted 9.15 million jin of relief grain, but this was also not the case in reality. Secondly, after receiving relief grain, some have failed to distribute it correctly, appropriately, and in a timely manner, so that it has not been able to fully play its role in promoting production. Some lack meticulous organizational work and act rashly, forming egalitarian distribution. Others, in order to control mobile grain, have formed a situation of hoarding grain without releasing it. Many areas have only paid attention to the severely affected areas and ignored the lightly affected areas, or only paid attention to the disaster areas and ignored the non-disaster areas and the overall planning and scheduling, causing the lightly affected areas to become severely affected areas, and the original non-disaster areas to gradually experience famine phenomena due to improper financial and grain scheduling or lack of tight work. Some areas only paid attention to sideline production and neglected agricultural production, or only paid attention to sideline production and neglected to launch social mutual assistance, or only paid attention to production and neglected thrift. In non-disaster areas, they only paid attention to thrift for disaster prevention and did not propose to support disaster areas. Some economic agencies emphasized their own business and were unwilling to automatically cooperate with disaster relief work, and even hindered the disaster victims from making a living, causing resentment among the disaster victims. On the other hand, some places are biased towards a gift-giving view, forcing cooperatives to buy unsalable goods and inferior goods at high prices, or giving work-for-relief grain to those without labor, affecting the state's plan to restore economic construction. In addition, some warehouses lack experience in storing grain, and the grain that should be issued and adjusted is withheld, and the people lack grain, while the grain in the warehouse is deteriorating, causing losses to both the public and private. Even individual cadres have made serious mistakes such as competing with the people for profit, using relief grain for personal gain, and parochialism in production and disaster relief. These are not allowed and must be corrected quickly.

　　(3)

　　At present, the disaster situation in the country is generally not very serious, but it is indeed very serious in individual areas. It is estimated that about 7 million disaster victims across the country are in urgent need of relief (including widowers, widows, orphans, the disabled, and family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers who have no labor force and cannot produce). The winter disaster has passed, and the most important issue now is to overcome the spring famine. The key lies in the quality of our production and disaster relief work. If the work is done well, a severe disaster can be turned into a minor disaster, and the famine can be overcome; otherwise, a minor disaster will also turn into a severe disaster. We are currently facing a serious battle to deal with the spring famine. The method is: first, to further deepen the implementation of the policy of self-salvation through production. All disaster areas should make disaster relief work the only central task at present. The main cadres of governments at all levels in the disaster area must personally lead this work and pay attention to supervision and inspection. The main cadres of provinces with disasters should go deep into the severely affected areas, establish a working committee, and reside permanently to direct them, so as to understand the disaster situation in a timely manner, discover and solve problems, implement policies, increase initiative and foresight, and correct various deviations in the work in a timely manner. In order to organize the strength of the broad masses of the people, and to make production and disaster relief work universal and in-depth, people's representative conferences or village people's congresses should be widely convened in the disaster areas to mobilize enthusiasm for self-salvation through production and seek specific production methods suitable to local conditions, appropriately distribute loan grain and relief grain, and grasp the slogan that "the issuance process is the organizational process" so that public assistance can exert greater strength. We must realize the political task of "not letting a single person starve to death." During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, we suffered severe blockades and destruction from the enemy. At that time, our material strength was much weaker than it is now, but we have more than once overcome severe disasters and did not let anyone starve to death. Our strength is much greater now than before, and we should never doubt that our material strength is insufficient. The people of our country are hardworking and brave. Our cadres are with the people, and with our rich experience in overcoming disasters, we should have full confidence in overcoming the current serious spring famine. The problem is that the Party, government, military, and people in the disaster area must all be mobilized to concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in this central task. Governments at all levels should embrace the enthusiasm of "disaster relief is like fighting a fire," further strengthen leadership over disaster relief work, summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner, and fight against bureaucratic work styles.

　　In order to do a good job in production and disaster relief, governments and departments at all levels must closely cooperate and act in coordination. In general, production and disaster relief committees at all levels have been established in various disaster areas, and it is necessary to further strengthen and improve them so that they become powerful institutions for leading disaster relief work. Under unified leadership, in addition to emergency rescue work, we should actively support agricultural and sideline production in disaster areas, supply raw materials, provide loans, purchase finished products, and organize transportation and sales. All localities should arrange spring plowing as soon as possible, and various agricultural loans should be issued quickly. The slaughter of draught animals should be strictly prohibited. If they really cannot be raised, joint raising should be advocated, or grass should be loaned appropriately to help. The water conservancy department should have a good grasp of the water conservancy construction plan, and strive to complete it before the flood season, and use as many disaster victims as possible to work, and do not cause futile round trips and waste of people's labor. The epidemic prevention problem in the disaster area should be planned in advance. For the production of family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, they should be mobilized to work themselves, and proper organization of substitute farming should still be organized. For the phenomenon of blind fleeing, we should immediately try to dissuade them, but those who have already fled out should be given appropriate resettlement and organized production. All of these should be listed as the center of discussion when the People's Representative Conference is convened in the disaster area. In short, all departments must put forth their greatest efforts for production and disaster relief work, cooperate with each other, be consistent in their steps, and lead the broad masses of disaster-stricken people to overcome the disaster. At the same time, we must proceed from an overall perspective and must understand that in order to stabilize prices and restore and develop necessary economic construction, all economic work departments have their specific tasks, and they can only focus on the business plan under their jurisdiction, combined with disaster relief. Only in this way can we achieve organic work coordination, and only in this way can we meet the current and future interests of disaster victims.

　　In disaster relief work, it is necessary to carry out a thrift and mutual assistance movement. In this regard, we have already made great achievements in the past. In order to prepare to deal with the spring famine, we should continue to call on central and local organs, groups, and non-combat troops to save one or two liang of rice per person per day for disaster relief, and expand this movement to the society, universally calling on people who have grain to eat to save grain, saving one liang of rice per person per day, saving for one month, it is possible to spend the life of ten disaster victims in need of emergency relief for one day, so we should resolutely oppose the phenomenon of wasting grain. In the disaster area, we should also encourage free lending and carry out mass mutual assistance. We should accumulate every bit of strength to help the disaster victims.

　　Finally, under the difficult circumstances of the national finances, judging from various materials, the central government and the governments of various disaster-stricken areas have spent nearly 1.2 billion jin on work-for-relief and relief grain (including the emergency relief portion), most of which is work-for-relief grain, and the relief grain is nearly 400 million jin. Others that are planned to be issued this spring include funds for river management and flood prevention, agricultural loans, and sideline product grain exchange contracts of the Cooperative Affairs Bureau, which are also considerable. In order to help the disaster areas overcome the famine, the central government is also prepared to allocate another 130 million jin to 200 million jin of grain for emergency use, so as to properly distribute it after inspecting the situation in various severely affected areas and the grain situation in various localities.

　　The Central Disaster Relief Committee is the highest command authority for national disaster relief work. Its purpose is to enable relevant departments to coordinate with each other, be consistent in their steps, and unify the leadership of national disaster relief work. Various problems that require central government resolution due to disasters in various localities should be studied quickly and resolved in a timely manner in order to successfully overcome the spring famine. We have the confidence to overcome the disaster and want to gain experience in production and disaster relief to improve our other work.

　　深入开展生产救灾工作
    董副总理在中央救灾委员会成立会上的报告
    【新华社北京五日电】中央人民政府政务院董必武副总理二月二十七日在中央救灾委员会成立会上的报告，题为“深入开展生产救灾工作”，全文如下：
            （一）
    去年全国许多地区遭到很大天灾。由于国民党匪帮长期搜刮和日本帝国主义侵略中国的结果，人民生活极端痛苦，缺乏抗灾能力；而在日本侵略中国和国民党发动内战时期，本已年久失修的堤岸又受到严重破坏，防水效用因而大减。由于这些原因，就使得有些地区的灾情甚为严重。
    各级人民政府一开始即领导人民和灾荒作斗争。春夏旱时，人民政府即领导人民抗旱点种，扑灭虫害；水灾到来，人民政府即领导人民全力抢险。黄河流量超过以往任何一年，沿河各级人民政府全体干部上堤，和农民一起冒雨抢险，奋不顾身，终于把水势打下，未遭决口。虽有部分地区，因水流过大，雨量过多，尤其因无法抗拒的台风，而遭到淹没；但各种抢救工作已把灾情严重的程度大大地缩减了。汛期既过，人民政府即号召与组织群众排水种麦，提出“小利服从大利，洼地服从高地，下游服从上游”的口号。各省种麦面积，多达被淹地的百分之八十以上。这就保证了可以缩短灾期。
    中央人民政府成立后，先后发出生产救灾指示，责成各受灾地区以生产救灾为目前的中心工作。提出“不要饿死一个人”的口号，同时派出三个视察组分赴苏北、平原及河北视察灾情和救灾工作。各地亦先后成立生产救灾委员会，有些省的负责干部深入灾区亲自督导救灾工作，有的并抽调大批干部组织重灾区工作委员会（或工作团），常驻灾区指挥救灾工作。我们的救灾方针是：生产自救、节约渡荒、群众互助、以工代赈，并辅之以必要的救济。各地均依此方针进行了工作。这些工作包括以下各项：
    首先是大力发展副业生产。在发展副业生产上提出了“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”的口号，并提倡群众互助，自由借贷，变死钱为活钱等办法，以解决资金缺乏的困难。对生产者采用先行贷粮，后收成品；对贩运者采用先行贷货，后收货款。各地贸易公司、供销合作社与各方订立合同，推销土产，如河北省即与中央贸易部订有贷粗粮换细粮一万万二千万斤的合同，由贸易部先付粗粮，麦收后再收回细粮。该省并与中央合作事业局订有收购土布五千万平方尺，皮硝三千万斤的合同，与东北订有收购火硝五十万斤的合同。平原、山东等地亦正在订立订货合同。这就使各地副业生产可以比较有计划地进行。
    其次，是以工代赈，运用灾民的劳力从事建设。苏北定出兴修水利三年计划，第一年拨出粮食即达两万万三千万斤。这一伟大的治水工程，不但能解决救灾问题，而且是苏北的重大建设。皖北各界人民代表会议，通过关于大力兴修水利的决议，政府拨出的以工代赈及救济粮已达二万万七千万斤。山东水利与治黄工程，本年拨款粮已达一万万二千万斤。平原拨出治黄粮三千万斤。中南区拨了四亿斤粮食，大部用在灾区的以工代赈和救济上。凡可能由灾民从事的工程，应尽量雇用灾民。这是积极的救灾办法，各地都已收到很大成绩。
    此外，是实行节约，号召灾民种菜与搜集野菜以代粮食。各地政府工作人员与人民解放军自动进行节约一两米运动，有的机关甚至每日每人节约四、五两粮，有的干部拿出全部津贴救济灾民。在各大城市进行了救灾劝募，在乡村进行了一碗米救灾运动。仅河北一省即募救济粮食一千二百五十万斤。中央及各大行政区又复拨出大批粮食，支持灾区生产和进行救济。华北区的急赈粮和救济粮由中央批准拨给的为三千五百万斤。我们并计划从东北，从晋、绥、察，及从川、湘、赣等地调运粮食，以调剂民食。
    以上就是我们已作过的救灾工作概况。在干部和广大人民的努力下，我们已胜利地渡过了严重的冬荒。
            （二）
    但是灾荒还只克服了一半或者大半，严重情况还没有过去，目前正处在春荒时节。俗语说：“灾荒怕尾不怕头”，任何一点疏忽，就会闹出乱子。经验证明：我们的救灾工作，全靠加强领导，深入检查，组织灾民，生产自救，精打细算，节约互助，来补救物质缺乏与交通不便的困难。我们过去这样做了，现在仍是这样做，但做的深度与广度，还很不够。不少地方干部中的官僚主义倾向，还相当严重：如对灾民关心不够，不深入到灾区中去；对生产自救的信心不足，怕困难，单等救济；对工作有布置无检查，只单纯搬运上级的指示，而没有研究具体情况，只有空喊而不善于组织群众等。救灾工作本是一系列的，从护堤抢险、排水种麦、组织副业、推销成品、节约互助、急赈救济、以至布置春耕，不可有一环孤立，不可有一时松懈。许多地方是这样做了，但某些地区，却发生偏向，在排水种麦以后，对于提倡副业生产，动手晚了一些，以致发生盲目逃荒的现象。或者进行了副业生产，但成品推销不出，对灾民仍然无所补益，以致大批耕畜被卖掉或被杀死，这对灾区的人力畜力是极大的损失，若不赶紧抢救，就要影响春耕。有的未深入调查研究，把特殊问题一般化。有的把本地区“常年缺粮”与“救灾所需粮”及“急赈粮”与“救济粮”的数字混同起来。也有的把全部问题提到中央解决，而不是实事求是地精确计算需要中央帮助多少即可使灾民得救。有些地区作不切实际的报告，例如河北原报告有六十五万人卧倒，急待救济，但据灾区视察组了解，绝非如此；察哈尔原要救济粮九百一十五万斤，而实际也非如此。其次，在得了救济粮以后，有的未能正确适当地及时分配，致未能充分发挥推动生产的作用。有的缺乏细密的组织工作，草率从事，形成平均主义的分配。也有的因要掌握机动粮，形成压粮不放。不少地区仅注意了重灾区，忽视了轻灾区，或者仅注意灾区而忽视了非灾区和全盘的计划调度，致使轻灾区变成了重灾区，而原是非灾区也因财粮调度不适当或工作抓得不紧，致使个别地方逐渐发生饥荒现象。也有些地区只注意搞副业生产而忽视了农业生产，或只注意了副业生产，而忽视了发动社会互济，或只注意生产不注意节约。而在非灾区，则只注意节约防荒，而未提出支援灾区。有些经济机关，强调本身业务，不愿自动配合救灾工作，甚至有妨碍灾民谋生，引起灾民怨恨。另一方面，也有些地方偏于恩赐观点，强使合作社高价收买冷货、次货，或以无劳力的领工赈粮，影响国家恢复经济建设事业的计划。此外，某些仓库缺乏保管粮食经验，对存粮应发放、应调剂的，却扣不发放，人民缺粮，仓中粮又在坏，致公私俱受损失。甚至个别干部在生产救灾中发生与民争利、私用救济粮以及本位主义等严重错误。这些，都是不能容许的，必须迅速予以纠正。
            （三）
    目前全国的灾情，一般说来，并不算很严重，但在个别地区确是很严重的。估计全国急待救济的灾民约七百万人（其中包括鳏、寡、孤、独及烈、军、工属中的无劳力不能生产者）。冬灾已过，目前最重要的问题是渡过春荒。关键就在于我们生产救灾工作的好坏，工作做得好，重灾即可变为轻灾，灾荒可以渡过，否则轻灾也会变为重灾。我们目下面临着对付春荒的严重战斗。其办法：首先是进一步地深入贯彻生产自救的方针，所有灾区应把救灾工作做为当前唯一的中心工作。灾区各级政府的主要干部，要亲自动手领导这一工作，注意督促检查。有灾各省的主要干部要深入到重灾区去，成立工作委员会常驻指挥，以便及时了解灾情，发现与解决问题，贯彻政策，增加主动和预见，并及时纠正工作中的各种偏向。为了组织广大人民力量，使生产救灾工作普遍而深入，在灾区应普遍召开各界人民代表会议或村人民大会，以发动生产自救热情并寻求因地制宜的具体生产办法，恰当地分配贷粮及救济粮，掌握“发放过程即组织过程”的口号，使公家的帮助能发挥更大的力量。我们一定要实现“不要饿死一个人”这一政治任务。抗战期间及解放战争中我们遭受着敌人严重地封锁破坏，那时物质力量比现在弱得多，但我们却曾经不只一次地战胜了严重的灾荒，没饿死人。我们现在力量比以前大得多了，决不要怀疑我们物质力量不足。我国的人民是勤劳而勇敢的，我们的干部和人民在一起，再加上我们已有战胜灾荒的丰富经验，克服目前严重的春荒，应该是具有充分信心的。问题是灾区党、政、军、民必须都动员起来，集中力量搞好这一中心工作。各级政府都要抱着“救灾如救火”的热情，进一步加强对于救灾工作的领导，及时总结交流经验，并与官僚主义作风作斗争。
    为了搞好生产救灾工作，各级政府各部门必须密切配合，协同动作。灾区各地一般已成立各级生产救灾委员会，须要进一步把它加强和健全起来，使它成为领导救灾工作的强有力的机构。在统一领导下，除急救工作外，应积极扶持灾区农副业生产，供给原料、贷予资金、收购成品、组织运销。各地应即早布置春耕，各种农贷应迅速发放，并应严禁宰杀耕畜，其确无法饲养的，应提倡伙养，或酌予贷草帮助。水利部门应很好的掌握水利建设计划，务期于汛期以前完工，尽量使用有劳力的灾民做工，不要发生徒劳往返浪费民力的现象。对灾区防疫问题应事先筹划。对烈、军、工属的生产应动员其自己劳动，一面仍应适当组织代耕。对于盲目逃荒现象，应立即设法劝阻，但业已逃出在外者，即应予以适当安置，并组织生产。所有这些，在灾区召开人民代表会议时，应列为讨论的中心。总之，各部门对生产救灾工作都要拿出最大力量，互相配合，步调一致，领导广大灾区群众战胜灾荒。同时必须从全面出发，必须了解：我们为稳定物价及恢复与发展必要的经济建设，各经济工作部门都有其特定的任务，他们只能以主管的业务计划为主，结合救灾。亦只有这样做，才能取得有机的工作配合，也才符合灾民目前和将来的利益。
    在救灾工作中必须开展节约互助运动，在这方面，以前我们已有很大成绩。为了准备应付春荒，今后应继续号召中央及各地机关团体与非作战部队每人每日一两或二两米的节约救灾运动，并把这一运动扩展到社会上，普遍号召有粮吃的人节约粮食，每人每日节省一两米，节省一个月，就可能渡十个须急赈的灾民一天的生活，因此应当坚决反对浪费粮食的现象。在灾区应并鼓励自由借贷，开展群众互助。我们应把一点一滴的力量积聚起来，援助灾民。
    最后，在国家财政困难的情况下，从各种材料看，中央和各有灾地区政府用于以工代赈和救济粮（包括急赈部分）差不多有十二亿斤，其中绝大部分是工赈粮，救济粮差不多有四亿斤，其他准备在今春发放的尚有治河防汛经费、农业贷款、合作事业管理局的副业产品易粮合同等，为数亦很可观。为帮助灾区渡荒，中央并准备再拨出一亿三千万斤到二亿斤粮食为急救之用，以便在检查各重灾区情况及各地粮食情形后妥为分配。
    中央救灾委员会是全国救灾工作的最高指挥机关，其目的在使各有关部门互相配合，步调一致，统一领导全国救灾工作。对于各地因灾荒而发生的须中央解决的各个问题应迅速研究及时解决，以便胜利的渡过春荒。我们有信心战胜灾荒，而且要在生产救灾中取得经验，以改进我们的其他工作。
