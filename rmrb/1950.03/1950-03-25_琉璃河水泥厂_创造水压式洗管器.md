　　Liulihe Cement Plant
    Creates Water Pressure Pipe Cleaner
    [Our Newspaper] Zhang Kun, deputy chief of the power section of the Liulihe Cement Plant on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, has created a new pipe cleaner that has greatly contributed to repair work. The boiler room of the plant originally used a motor-driven pipe cleaner, but due to its age, the flexible steel wire core had lost its effectiveness and could no longer be used. This made pipe cleaning, especially during major overhauls, very difficult. Zhang Kun, the deputy section chief (promoted from worker after liberation), diligently studied the problem for more than a month and designed a water pressure pipe cleaner. After the repair section manufactured it according to the design, it was installed and tested on the 13th of this month, with good results. This new creation not only facilitates work but also saves manpower. (Ren Zuo)

　　琉璃河水泥厂
    创造水压式洗管器
    【本报讯】京汉路琉璃河水泥厂动力股副股长张琨创造新的洗管器，对修检工作贡献很大。该厂锅炉房原用马达带动用的洗管器，因历年太久，其中钢丝弹性轴心已失效能，不能使用。因此在洗管特别是进行大修检时，感到非常困难。该厂副股长张琨（解放后由工人提升的），精心钻研月余，设计了一种水压式的洗管器，交由修理股按图制出后，于本月十三日按置试验，结果良好。这一新的创造，不但便利了工作，且节省了人力。（任佐）
