Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS New York, 11th: The American peace movement continues to expand. Millions of letters are flooding government agencies and Congress, demanding serious efforts to resolve current US-Soviet differences. Thirty-three American writers issued a statement to the press, vehemently criticizing the State Department's March 3rd decision to refuse the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace permission to appeal to Congress for disarmament and to declare atomic weapons illegal. Signatories to this statement include renowned novelists Maltz, Fast, Gold, Hammett, Waffle, screenwriter Lawson, poets Hughes and Rostand, *Masses & Mainstream* magazine editor Sillen, and other prominent figures.

*Compass* newspaper published an article by Smith, editor of *Soviet Russia Today* magazine, demanding that the US government abandon its current evil policy and negotiate with the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful resolution to outstanding issues. Smith emphasized that the Soviet Union desires peace, saying: "Soviet leaders have reiterated their belief in the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between the socialist system and the capitalist system. Striving for peace has been and remains the core of Soviet foreign policy."

*The Daily Worker* urged intensifying the struggle for peace. The newspaper also contrasted the State Department's refusal to allow the Great Peace Delegation to enter with the Soviet Union's warm welcome of the delegation. *The Daily Worker* stated that State Department officials were terrified by the prospect of peace...The thought that the billions of dollars in contracts they signed with arms manufacturers might be reduced thereby gave them Forrestal's disease, i.e., they were nearly ready for a straitjacket at the mere mention of the word peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS New York, 11th: Nearly a thousand people attended a peace rally held at "Webster" Hall in New York. At the meeting, speakers emphasized that the growing American peace movement reflects the feelings of the majority of the people and requires the broad participation of the working class. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to defeat the conspiracies of reactionary American trade union leaders who are dividing working-class unity and helping warmongers implement their plans. William Z. Foster, Labor Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States - one of the eleven "convicted" Communist leaders - urged the greatest effort to defeat the reactionary Mundt Bill. He said this was a crucial step in the struggle against the already growing danger of war.

The meeting passed a resolution in support of the striking French workers. The resolution said: "We are deeply moved by the struggle of the French workers against American imperialism."

　　美和平运动扩展
    三十三名作家发表声明抗议拒绝和大代表团入境
    纽约举行千人和平集会
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社纽约十一日讯：美国和平运动继续扩展中。千万封信件涌入政府各机构和国会中，要求认真努力解决目前的美苏分歧。三十三名美国作家向报界发表声明，猛烈抨击国务院三日拒绝允许世界拥护和平大会常设委员会代表团向国会呼吁裁减军备与宣布原子武器为非法的决定。这一声明的署名人包括著名小说家马尔兹、法斯特、哥尔德、哈麦特、瓦弗尔，电影脚本作家劳逊，诗人休士与罗斯坦，《大众与主流》杂志编辑西伦，以及其他著名人物。
    指南针日报刊载《今日苏联》杂志编辑史密斯的文章，要求美国政府放弃目前的罪恶政策，并与苏联进行谈判，对悬而未决的问题谋取和平解决。史密斯强调指出苏联希望和平说：“苏联领袖已重申他们相信社会主义制度与资本主义制度有和平共存的可能性和必要性。争取和平，过去是而现在仍然是苏联外交政策的核心。”
    工人日报敦促加紧争取和平的斗争。该报并将国务院的拒绝和大代表团入境与苏联的热烈欢迎代表团作一对比。工人日报称，国务院的官员们对和平的前景感到惊恐……他们一想到与军火制造商所订的十亿元合同将因而减少的情形时，就得了福莱斯特的病症，即一听到和平的字眼就几乎可以穿上疯人的紧身衣。
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社纽约十一日讯：有近千人出席在纽约“韦伯斯特”大厅举行的拥护和平集会。在会上，发表演说的人们都调强指出：增长中的美国和平运动，反映着大多数人民的感情，和需要工人阶级广泛的参加。为了达到这一目的，必须击败分裂工人阶级团结、帮助战争贩子实行其计划的美国反动工会领袖的阴谋。美国共产党全国委员会劳工书记威廉逊——被“判罪”的十一名共产党领袖之一，敦促尽最大的努力击败反动的蒙特法案。他说，这在反对已经增长的战争危险的斗争中，是一个紧要的步骤。
    集会通过决议，声援罢工中的法国工人。决议说：“我们对法国工人反对美国帝国主义的斗争，深为激动。”
