　　Safeguarding the Sovereignty of Danube Countries
    Soviet Reply Refutes the United States, Britain, France and Other Countries
    1948 Convention Fully Complies with Provisions of the Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian Peace Treaties
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, Moscow dispatch] TASS Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government sent replies to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and Greece on the 1st, responding to the notes of the aforementioned countries regarding their non-recognition of the 1948 Danube Convention and the Danube Commission established according to the convention. The replies to the United States, Britain, and France stated: In 1948, the Soviet Union and the Danube countries signed a convention on the navigation regime of the Danube River. Representatives of the United States, Britain, and France also attended the meeting. This convention restored the sovereignty of the Danube countries over the management of the Danube River, replacing the unreasonable convention signed in 1921 according to the Treaty of Versailles, which gave the main management power of the Danube River to Britain and France, which were not Danube countries. The United States, Britain, and France therefore refused to participate in the convention. After the Danube Commission held its first meeting in November 1949, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries sent notes to the Soviet Union, groundlessly stating that the convention did not comply with the provisions of the Romanian, Bulgarian, and Hungarian peace treaties. The arguments of the United States, Britain, and France had already been rejected by the Danube countries at the 1948 meeting. The Soviet government believes that the 1948 convention fully complies with the provisions of the peace treaties. It guarantees the sovereignty of the Danube countries and restores the universally recognized rule that navigation management power belongs entirely to the riparian countries. In its replies to the governments of Belgium, Italy, and Greece, the Soviet government pointed out that, according to the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers in December 1946, these three countries were not participants in the Danube Conference and therefore cannot discuss the statements of these three countries.

　　保障多瑙河国家主权
    苏联复文驳斥美英法等国
    一九四八年公约完全符合保罗匈和约规定
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府一日分别以复文送至美、英、法、比、意及希腊政府，答复上述各国关于不承认一九四八年多瑙河公约及依照公约而成立的多瑙河委员会的照会。致美、英、法三国的复文称：一九四八年苏联和多瑙河国家签订了有关多瑙河航行制度的公约，美、英、法三国代表亦曾出席会议，这个公约恢复了多瑙河国家管理多瑙河的主权，代替一九二一年根据凡尔赛和约所签订的不合理的公约，后者把多瑙河主要管理权交给非多瑙河国家的英国和法国。美、英、法三国为此拒绝参加该公约。一九四九年十一月多瑙河委员会召开首届会议后，美、英、法等国并照会苏联，毫无根据地说该公约不符合罗、保、匈和约的规定。美、英、法三国的论点早已在一九四八年会议上遭到多瑙河国家的拒绝。苏联政府认为：一九四八年公约完全符合和约规定，它保证了多瑙河国家的主权，并恢复了航行管理权完全属于两岸国家的众所公认的规则。苏联政府在致比利时、意大利和希腊政府的复文中指出：根据一九四六年十二月外长会议的决定，该三国并非多瑙河会议参加者，因而不能讨论该三国的声明。
