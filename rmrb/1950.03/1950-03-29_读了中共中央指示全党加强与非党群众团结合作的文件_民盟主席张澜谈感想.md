Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, made a statement regarding the CPC Central Committee's directive of March 25th:

　　After reading the CPC Central Committee's announcement requiring the entire Party to strengthen unity and cooperation with non-Party masses and democratic figures, I have the following two thoughts:

　　First, due to some Party members committing the mistake of closed-doorism, the CPC Central Committee, in order to avoid "thereby causing damage to the people's cause," publicly issued a directive requiring Party members to "overcome" this "shortcoming," and specifically re-published documents by Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong on this issue, requiring Party members who have committed this mistake to "earnestly study them and conduct self-criticism accordingly." This spirit of openly facing reality is truly what the ancients called "like the eclipse of the sun and moon." This serious attitude of being responsible to the revolution and the people is worthy of learning by every non-Party person, especially democratic figures, and they should rise up and emulate it!

　　Second, the so-called "non-Party masses" naturally refer to the four friends in the Common Program, and not the three reactionary enemies. Under the people's democratic dictatorship, the three enemies have fundamentally lost the right to be united and cooperated with. Therefore, we who are in the position of friends should reflect: Are we good enough to be good friends? Can our ideology and style be compatible with this good friend? In other words, have we fulfilled the obligations and responsibilities of being a friend? Chairman Mao earnestly admonished Communist Party members: "National affairs are public affairs of the country, not private affairs of a single party or faction. Therefore, Communist Party members only have the obligation to practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and have no right to exclude others and monopolize everything. The Communist Party is a political party that seeks the interests of the nation and the people, and it itself has no selfish interests to seek." We non-Party people should conduct self-examination: Do we also have the same spirit of dedication to the interests of the nation and the people? Have we ever taken the initiative to implement "democratic cooperation" with Communist Party members with an attitude of being responsible for national affairs? Do we suffer from the petty-bourgeois intellectual's fault of arrogance and self-importance, "unwilling or unable" to conduct "close unity" with Communist Party members?

　　I believe that this important announcement not only has a certain educational effect on Communist Party members, and not only can have a good political influence on national affairs, but also can give non-Party people a certain enlightenment and inspiration, and has great benefits for the future of the entire people's cause.

　　读了中共中央指示全党加强与非党群众团结合作的文件
    民盟主席张澜谈感想
    【新华社二十八日讯】民主同盟主席张澜对中共中央三月二十五日的指示发表谈话称：
    我读了中共中央要求全党加强与非党群众及民主人士团结合作的文告以后，有下列两点感想：
    一、由于部分的党员犯有关门主义的毛病，中共中央为了避免“因此而使人民的事业受到损害”起见，就公开发布指示，要求党员“克服”这种“缺点”，并特地重新发表斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席论此问题的文件，要求犯有这种毛病的党员“认真地加以学习，并据以进行检讨”。这种勇于正视现实的光明磊落品质，真是古人所谓“如日月之蚀”。这种对革命对人民负责的严肃态度，值得每一位党外人士尤其是民主人士学习，并应奋起看齐！
    二、所谓“党外群众”，当然是指共同纲领中的四友，而非反动的三敌。对于三敌，他们在人民民主专政之下，根本失却了被团结合作的权利。因此，我们居于朋友地位的应该反省：我们够不够作一个好朋友？我们的思想意识与作风能否与这位好友相配合？换言之，我们尽了作朋友的义务与责任没有？毛主席谆谆告诫共产党员说：“国事是国家的公事，不是一党一派的私事，因此共产党员只有对党外人士实行民主合作的义务，而无排斥别人垄断一切的权利。共产党是为民族、为人民谋利益的政党，它本身决无私利可图。”我们党外人士应该作自我检讨：我们对民族对人民的利益，是否也具有同样的献身精神？我们曾否主动地以对国事负责的态度来与共产党员实行“民主合作”？我们是否犯有小资产阶级知识分子自高自大的毛病，“不愿或不善于”与共产党员进行“亲密团结”？
    我相信这一重要文告，不但对共产党员具有一定的教育作用，不但对国事能起良好的政治影响，同时也能使党外人士获到一定的启示和感召，对于整个人民事业的前程，实有重大裨益的。
