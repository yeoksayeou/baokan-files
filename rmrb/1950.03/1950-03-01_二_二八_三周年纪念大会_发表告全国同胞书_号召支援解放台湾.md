[Reported by this newspaper] The "February 28th" third anniversary commemoration meeting held in Beijing issued a letter to compatriots nationwide, stating in brief:

　　Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have liberated the entire mainland except for Tibet. However, Taiwan, which was obtained by the blood and sweat of the people during the eight-year War of Resistance, is still under the rule of reactionaries, becoming a last-ditch stronghold for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In order to eradicate the bandits' last lair, rescue the Taiwan people from their suffering, and complete the victory of the entire country, we must liberate Taiwan. We must expose all the conspiracies of American imperialism against Taiwan; and we hope that the officers and soldiers who are still being coerced by the Kuomintang bandit gang to serve as their bodyguards will open their eyes, recognize the overall situation, and turn the bullets used to massacre the people into weapons to eliminate the Chiang bandits.

　　Taiwan compatriots! We must carry forward the spirit of the "February 28th" uprising and the glorious tradition of consistently fighting against aggressors, unite under the banner of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and with firm will and the conviction of victory, prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to fight for the liberation of Taiwan. We must transform the accumulated hatred of the past fifty years under the evil rule of Japanese and American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang into a huge force, and wage the most resolute and thorough struggle to liberate Taiwan and liberate all of China.

　　Compatriots across the country! The liberation of Taiwan will destroy the last lair of the Kuomintang bandit gang and will also destroy the springboard of American imperialism for aggression against China. In order to consolidate our national defense, for the eternal peace and happiness of the Chinese people, and for China to rapidly enter comprehensive peaceful construction, we must win the battle to liberate Taiwan. We must respond to the call of the Central People's Government, streamline and economize, actively produce, purchase public bonds, mobilize all manpower, financial resources, and materials, support the front lines, consolidate the rear, overcome difficulties, enrich preparations, and complete the glorious cause of liberating Taiwan and liberating all of China!

　　“二·二八”三周年纪念大会
    发表告全国同胞书  号召支援解放台湾
    【本报讯】在北京举行的“二·二八”三周年纪念大会发表告全国同胞书，略称：
    今天中国人民在中共领导下，已解放了西藏以外的整个大陆，但全国人民八年抗战的血汗所换回来的台湾还在反动派统治下，成了蒋匪帮垂死挣扎的据点。为了铲除匪帮最后巢穴，拯救水深火热中的台湾人民，完成全国的胜利，我们必须解放台湾。我们要揭破美国帝国主义对台湾的种种阴谋；并希望还被国民党匪帮胁迫着充当他们的保镖的官兵们放开眼光、认清大局，把屠杀人民的枪弹变成消灭蒋匪的武器。
    台湾同胞们！我们要发挥“二·二八”起义的精神和一贯地向侵略者进行斗争的光荣传统，在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的旗帜下团结起来，以坚决的意志和必胜的信念，准备配合人民解放军，为解放台湾而奋斗。要把五十年来在日、美帝国主义和国民党匪帮的罪恶统治下的积恨变成巨大的力量，为解放台湾、解放全中国作一次最坚决最彻底的斗争。
    全国同胞们！台湾的解放，将是捣毁国民党匪帮最后的巢穴，而且是摧毁美帝国主义侵略中国的跳板。为了巩固我们的国防，为了中国人民永远的安宁与幸福，为了中国迅速进入全面的和平建设，我们必定要赢得解放台湾之战。我们要响应中央人民政府的号召，精简节约，积极生产，购买公债，动员一切人力财力物力，支援前线，巩固后方，克服困难，充实准备，完成解放台湾、解放全中国的光荣事业！
