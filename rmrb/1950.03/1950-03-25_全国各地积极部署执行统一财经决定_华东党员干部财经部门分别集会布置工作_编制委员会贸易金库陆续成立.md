Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 23rd: Various regions in East China are actively deploying and implementing the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on unified national financial and economic work. The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC convened a conference of more than 2,000 Party cadres as early as the 11th of this month. At the meeting, Zeng Shan first reported on the spirit and resolutions of the National Finance Conference held in February, followed by a speech by Rao Shushi. On behalf of the East China Bureau, Rao Shushi called on Party organizations at all levels in East China and all Communist Party members to strive to resolutely ensure the full realization of this decision of the Government Administration Council. When talking about strengthening tax work, he emphasized the need to change the idea of ​​attaching importance to public grain and neglecting tax revenue that some comrades had developed in the past rural environment, and to assign the best Party members and cadres to tax work. He stressed that streamlining institutions is not only to save financial expenditures, but also to improve work efficiency. At the same time, the streamlining work must be closely linked with the rectification of cadres' ideology and work style.

The East China Regional Taxation Bureau also held a symposium of directors of taxation bureaus from provinces and cities. The participating cadres unanimously expressed their confidence in completing the region's tax revenue task for the year and ensuring the realization of the national fiscal budget. A meeting of heads of industry, commerce, and trade departments in various provinces and cities including Shanghai and Nanjing, convened by the East China Trade Department, decided to resolutely implement the trade treasury system and currency withdrawal plan. The East China Grain Bureau is actively deploying a general grain inspection campaign in various places to strengthen grain protection. In addition, the East China Industrial Department successively convened meetings of military representatives of its affiliated public factories and a general meeting of all staff members of the Industrial Department and heads of its affiliated public factories. Zhejiang Province convened a provincial commissioner conference, the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance convened a provincial accounting and auditing conference and a provincial government directly affiliated units supply expansion conference, the Subei Administrative Office convened a financial and economic expansion conference, and the Qingdao Military Control Commission convened a financial and economic committee meeting, respectively conveying the Government Administration Council's decisions and arranging specific steps and methods for implementing these decisions.

While the above-mentioned places held meetings to arrange work, the Establishment Committees of Shanghai and Nanjing were established successively on the 10th and 20th. So far, six trade treasury branches have been established in the East China region, including Shandong Province, Southern Jiangsu Region, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Qingdao. In Nanjing, after the People's Government conveyed to 65 economic work units, including public enterprises and cooperatives, the Government Administration Council's decision on the payment of industrial and commercial taxes by public enterprises, public Nanjing Power Plant and the Municipal Trading Company have successively paid business taxes for 1949 and January and February of this year.

    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东区各地正在积极部署和执行中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定。中共中央华东局暨上海市委会早于本月十一日即召开了二千余人的党员干部大会。会上首先由曾山报告二月召开的全国财政会议的精神和决议，继由饶漱石讲话。饶漱石代表华东局号召华东各级共产党组织和全体共产党员为坚决保证政务院这一决定的全部实现而努力。在谈到加强税收工作时，他着重指出必须改变部分同志在过去农村环境中所养成的重视公粮、轻视税收的思想，调派最好的党员和干部去做税收工作。他强调整编机构不仅是为了节省财政开支，而且也是为了提高工作效率，同时整编工作必须与整顿干部思想作风密切联系进行。
    华东区税务管理局也召开了各省区市税务局长座谈会，与会干部一致表示有信心完成今年度全区税收任务，保证全国财政概算的实现。华东区贸易部召集的各省区及沪、宁两市工商、贸易部门负责人会议，决定坚决执行贸易金库制度与货币回笼计划。华东区粮食局则积极布置各地普遍开展查仓运动，加强护粮工作。此外，华东工业部先后召开了所属各公营工厂军事代表会议与工业部全体工作人员及所属各公营工厂负责人大会，浙江省召开了全省专员会议，福建省财政厅召开了全省会计审计会议及省府直属单位供给扩大会议，苏北行署召开了财经扩大会议，青岛市军管会召开了财经委员会议，分别传达了政务院的各项决定，布置了具体贯彻这些决定的步骤和办法。
    与上述各地召开会议布置工作的同时，上海和南京两市编制委员会已于十日、二十日先后成立。华东全区截至目前止已建立贸易金库分库者，计有山东省、苏南区和上海、南京、杭州、青岛等六个分库。南京市在人民政府向公营企业及合作社等六十五个经济工作单位传达政务院关于公营企业缴纳工商业税的决定后，已先后有公营南京电厂和市贸易公司等单位缴纳一九四九年度和今年一、二月份的营业税。
