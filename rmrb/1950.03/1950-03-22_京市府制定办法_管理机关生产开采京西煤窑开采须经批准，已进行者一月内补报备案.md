　　Beijing Municipal Government Formulates Measures
    Management of Coal Mine Exploitation in Western Beijing by Organizations Requires Approval; Existing Operations Must Register Within One Month

    [Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently formulated the "Beijing Municipality Western District Organization Production and Exploitation of Coal Mines Management Measures," which was announced and implemented on March 20th. All military and government organizations, groups, and schools that are engaged in coal mine exploitation in the Western District of Beijing for organizational production shall be handled in accordance with these measures. The term "organizational production" as used here refers to production carried out by military and government organizations, groups, and schools as units, and does not apply to production by individual cadres. The measures stipulate that any unit intending to engage in organizational production must first obtain formal certification from its respective organization, which will be reviewed by the Western Beijing Mining Bureau and approved by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee before exploitation can proceed. All organizational production, whether solely funded or jointly funded, shall be regarded as private production and shall not have any special rights. It shall also abide by all mining laws and regulations and shall not violate them. If any organization wishes to engage in joint ventures with private individuals to operate coal mines, it must obtain the consent of the private individuals, and no forced shareholding or purchase of shares shall be allowed. After shareholding or purchase of shares, the shareholder rights shall be the same as those of private shareholders. The contract agreed upon by both parties must be submitted for review and filing before it can be considered valid. As for individual cadres who invest solely or jointly in production, they must first obtain permission and certification from their own organization. All their rights and obligations are the same as those of private production, and they must not impersonate the organization. Violators shall be held legally responsible. Organizational production that was already underway before the promulgation of these measures and has not been reported for approval shall be reported for supplementary filing within one month from March 20th, otherwise it will be considered illegal.
