　　Agricultural Loans Must Be Used for Their Intended Purpose

　　Beijing's Thirteen District Governments Send Letters for Self-Criticism, Correcting Deviations and Hoping to Attract Attention in Other Regions

Editor:

    The Suburban Work Committee once stipulated that this year's loans should emphasize being used for their intended purpose, and must not be diverted. For this purpose, we conducted a detailed investigation and discovered some deviations. Today, we want to report them to you and ask that they be published in the newspaper to draw the attention of comrades in other districts.

    In the 1950 spring early-maturing crop seed loan, Ma Defang of Komuzifang Village in our district had already prepared spring wheat seeds. However, he borrowed 200,000 yuan in this loan, planted his own seeds, and told the village cadres that he bought them with the loan. In reality, he used the loan for his son's wedding expenses.

    Xu Junhua borrowed two dou of wheat seeds last fall and ate them all. This time, he borrowed 30 jin of spring wheat seeds and millet, but he bought corn instead. When the cadres asked him, he said it was for the autumn planting. As a result, when we registered for the autumn crop seed loan, he registered for 40 jin of corn and 20 jin of soybeans.

    Zhu Guoyuan, the village head of Xiba Village, borrowed seeds for ten mu of land but only planted seven mu. When the cooperative bank and the work team comrades went to talk to him, he said, "Don't worry about it, I will repay whatever I borrow!"

    Yu Hai borrowed seeds for ten mu of land but only planted six mu. He ate the rest and gave some to those who plowed the land as livestock wages.

    There are many such situations, and I only wrote a few. These deviations are very serious, especially in villages with severe disasters, we should pay more attention. We are overcoming and correcting the above situations. I also hope that comrades in various regions pay attention. We must educate the masses more before the loan, strengthen the sense of responsibility of the loan team and village cadres, and mutually guarantee "special funds for special purposes." After the loan, we must go deep into the masses, conduct specific inspections and supervision, and correct deviations in a timely manner.

　　农贷一定要专款专用
    京市十三区政府来信进行自我批评  纠正偏向并希望引起其他地区注意编辑同志：
    郊区工作委员会曾规定今年贷款要强调专款专用，决不准移用。我们为此目的作了一详细调查，发现了一些偏向，今天要报告你们，并请在报纸上公布，以提起其他区同志们注意。
    一九五○年的春季早熟作物籽种贷款中，本区驹子房村马德方，自己早已备好了春麦种，但在这次的贷款时他又借二十万元，将自己的种籽种上，对村干说是用贷款买的，把贷款实际用来给他儿子结婚花费。
    许俊华去秋贷麦种时借了二斗完全吃了，这次又借春麦种小米三十斤，结果他又买了玉米。干部问他，他说是大秋种。结果我们在登记请贷大秋作物籽种时，他又登记了四十斤玉米、二十斤黄豆。
    西坝村闾长朱国元，借了十亩地的种子，只种上七亩。合作银行和工作组同志去找他谈，他还说：“你们不要管，我借多少还多少！”
    于海借了十亩地的种籽，只种上六亩，其余的吃了和给了耕地的作牲口工资。
    这样的情况还有许多，我只写出几个。这种偏向是非常严重的，特别是灾情重的村，我们更应注意。以上情形我们正在克服纠正，我还希望各地同志注意。我们要在贷款前多教育群众，加强贷款组和村干部的责任心，互相保证“专款专用”。贷款后，要深入群众，具体检查督促，发现偏向要及时纠正。
  北京市十三区政府王政民
