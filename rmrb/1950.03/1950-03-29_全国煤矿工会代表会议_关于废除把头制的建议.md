　　National Coal Miners' Union Representative Conference
　　Suggestions on Abolishing the Baotou System
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 28th] The suggestion made by the China Coal Miners' Union Representative Conference on February 1st to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government regarding the abolition of the Baotou system has been approved by the enlarged Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on March 9th. The full text of the suggestion is as follows:
　　In old coal mining enterprises, workers suffered from feudal and barbaric exploitation due to the existence of the Baotou system. Baotou not only paid no attention to the safety equipment in the mine, but also drove workers to mine in violation of technical and safety regulations, resulting in frequent and huge losses of life. Therefore, thoroughly destroying this dark system and getting rid of feudal shackles has become an urgent demand of the vast number of coal miners.
　　Today, the conditions for completely abolishing the Baotou system are fully mature nationwide. However, due to the unclear understanding of the feudal and exploitative nature and harm of the Baotou system by some administrative cadres in charge, the Baotou system in some mines still exists in its original form. Or, although there have been changes in form, the Baotou still holds administrative management positions in the mine, exercises the original privileges, and maintains the Baotou style, which seriously hinders the initiative and creativity of workers, reduces production efficiency, and even causes huge waste and disasters.
　　In the areas liberated earlier, those mines where this system has been completely abolished have immediately taken on a new look. The masses of workers are carrying out production with a new attitude towards labor, and a large number of new-type worker cadres are constantly emerging, and production efficiency has been significantly improved. Therefore, abolishing the Baotou system not only politically liberates the masses of workers from feudal oppression and economically liberates them from feudal exploitation, but also liberates the long-bound productive forces and rapidly improves the level of production in order to complete and exceed the state's production plans.
　　Based on the above situation, the representative conference specifically suggests to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government to issue an order to abolish the Baotou system and stipulate that Baotou shall not hold administrative management positions. Workers can file charges through legal procedures against those with notorious crimes. For the personnel employed by Baotou, they can be retained or transferred separately according to the opinions of the workers and whether they have production experience and whether their behavior is upright. Those with bad records should be criticized and educated, and appropriately placed after being agreed by the masses. At the same time, experienced workers with prestige should be promoted in large numbers to take on administrative and production management work, and a new management system should be established based on the principles of democratic management and enterprise management, eliminating the differential treatment between internal and external workers caused by the Baotou system, and promoting the unity of the masses of workers in order to facilitate the development of the production movement.

### 全国煤矿工会代表会议  关于废除把头制的建议

　　全国煤矿工会代表会议
    关于废除把头制的建议
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国煤矿工会代表会议于二月一日通过的关于废除把头制度向中央人民政府燃料工业部的建议，业经三月九日中华全国总工会扩大常委会批准。建议全文如下：
    在旧的煤矿企业中，由于把头制的存在，工人遭受着封建野蛮的剥削。把头不但毫不注意矿坑的安全设备，却驱使工人违反技术及安全规程来采掘，以致时常发生巨大的生命伤害；因此彻底摧毁此一黑暗制度，摆脱封建的桎梏，就成为广大煤矿工人的迫切要求。
    今天全国范围内已具备彻底废除把头制的充分成熟条件，可是由于某些行政负责干部对把头制的封建剥削性质与危害认识不清，因此某些矿坑的把头制度仍有原封未动的情形存在；或形式上虽有改变，而把头仍担任矿坑管理职务，执行原来的特权，保持着把头作风，严重地阻碍了工人的积极性与创造性的发挥，使生产效率低落，乃至造成巨大的浪费与灾害。
    在解放较早的地区，凡已彻底废除此一制度的部分矿坑，立即面貌一新，工人群众以新的劳动态度来进行生产，大批新型的工人干部，不断涌现，生产效率显著提高。因此取消把头制不仅使工人群众在政治上解除封建压迫，经济上解除封建剥削，同时可以解放久被束缚的生产力，迅速地提高生产水平，以完成并超过国家的生产计划。
    根据以上情况，代表会议特向中央人民政府燃料工业部建议，明令废除把头制度，规定把头不得担任行政管理工作；其中罪恶昭彰者，工人可以经过法律手续提出控告。对于把头所任用的人员，可以根据工人意见及本人有无生产经验、行为是否端正等分别予以留用、调用；有恶迹的进行批评教育，经过群众同意后予以适当安插。同时应大量提拔有威信有经验的工人，担任行政及生产管理上的工作，并根据管理民主化及经营企业化的原则，建立新的管理制度，取消因把头制而产生的里工与外工的差别待遇，促进工人群众之团结，以利于生产运动的开展。
