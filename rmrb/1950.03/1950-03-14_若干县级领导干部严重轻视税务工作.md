　　Several County-Level Leading Cadres Seriously Disregard Tax Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] Reporter Lu Chaoqi reports: Although the tax work in Hebei Province is generally valued by the leadership and most tax cadres are working very hard, enabling last year's tax revenue to exceed the target overall, there are still quite a few Party and government leading cadres below the county level who hold serious ideas of disregarding tax work, which has affected the failure of these counties to complete their tax revenue tasks and needs to be corrected quickly. According to the work reports from various special districts and cities in Hebei Province to the Provincial Taxation Bureau, as well as the reflections from the heads of various levels of bureaus who attended the first provincial tax conference, these leading cadres do not have a correct understanding of the national tax policy and the importance of tax work, mistakenly believing: "Tax work is nothing." "Taxation is merely about asking for money." "Tax collection is detrimental to production." Therefore, the following situations have occurred in the tax work of Hebei: (1) Indifference to tax work, transferring tax cadres to do other work for a long time. For example, the magistrate of Dingxing County in the Baoding Special District transferred the head of the Tax Bureau to do agricultural tax autumn collection work in the autumn of last year when the third quarter industrial and commercial tax was being levied. After the work was completed, he was assigned to purchase grain seeds in Gucheng. (2) Refusal to discuss tax issues at representative conferences of all sectors of society. For example, the magistrate of Qiu County in the Handan Special District refused to convey tax policies at representative conferences of all sectors of society. (3) Instructions from higher authorities regarding tax work are either poorly implemented or shelved, and some even arbitrarily reduce the number of taxes allocated by higher authorities or order the cessation of collection without reason. For example, when the Baoding Administrative Office ordered the collection of the fourth quarter industrial and commercial tax, the magistrate of Zhuo County said: "This was written by the Tax Bureau, let's put it aside and talk about it after the New Year!" Although the Tax Bureau repeatedly urged him, it has not yet started collecting the tax. The magistrate and county party committee of Jinghai County in the Tianjin Special District stopped collection upon hearing one-sided reports that taxes were heavy. The magistrate of Baxian County in the Tianjin Special District privately reduced the task assigned by the higher authorities by 20,000 jin of millet. (4) Some even, under the sway of muddled thinking, incited merchants to oppose the Tax Bureau. For example, Qiao, the chief of the Industrial and Commercial Section of Qiu County in the Handan Special District, incited merchants to question the Tax Bureau when collecting the first quarter industrial and commercial tax. These situations exist to varying degrees in most special districts of the province, and the most serious case is that of Du Enlin, the magistrate of Fangshan County in the Tongxian Special District. He showed indifference to instructions and decrees regarding tax work, saying when such documents were sent to him: "These are your (referring to the Tax Bureau) documents, you can handle them yourselves!" He also showed great disregard for the lives of tax cadres. On January 23 this year, Kang Huai, the resident staff member of the county tax bureau stationed at the Changguyudong Mine Coal Factory, was unfortunately killed by special agents on his way back to the county bureau with tax funds, while passing by the Guandimiao Temple in Cheshankou. The next day, Yang Fuli, the head of the county tax bureau, reported this to him, and instead of showing any concern, he rebuked Yang Fuli: "Who told him to collect taxes? You ask people for money, shouldn't people beat you to death?" Confusedly regarding the national tax work as "asking people for money," this represents a typical misunderstanding.
    Because these leading cadres disregard tax work, the work enthusiasm of many tax cadres has been dampened, which has seriously affected the completion of tax tasks. As evidenced by the fact that Fangshan County only completed about 70 percent of its tax task last year. These erroneous ideas must be given timely and appropriate criticism and correction.

### 若干县级领导干部严重轻视税务工作

　　若干县级领导干部严重轻视税务工作
    【本报讯】记者陆超祺报道：河北省的税收工作，虽领导上都还重视，大部税收干部亦甚努力，使去年税收在总的方面超过任务，但有不少县以下的党政领导干部仍然存在着严重的轻视税务工作的思想，以致影响各该县税收任务不能完成，需要迅速纠正。根据河北省各专、市给省税局的工作报告，以及参加全省首届税务会议的各级局长的反映，这些领导干部对于国家税收政策以及税收工作的重要性没有或缺乏正确的认识，错误地认为：“税务工作没有啥。”“税收仅仅是要钱而已。”“征税是打击生产的。”因此，河北税收工作中曾发生这样的情况：（一）对税务工作漠不关心，把税务干部长期调去做其他工作。如保定专区定兴县县长，在去年秋天开征第三季工商业税时，便把税务局局长调去做农业税秋征工作。工作结束后，又被指定在固城收购谷种子。（二）拒绝在各界代表会上讨论税收问题。如邯郸专区邱县县长，拒绝在各界代表会上传达税收政策。（三）对于上级有关税收工作的指示不是执行不力，便是搁置不理，有的甚至无故自行减除上级分配的税收数目或下令停止征收。如保定专署下令征收第四季工商业税时，涿县县长却说：“这是税局写的，放着过年再说吧！”虽经税局再三催促，但直到现在仍未开征。天津专区静海县县长和县委见到有人片面反映税重，竟然就下令停止征收。天津专区霸县县长，私自减除上级分配的任务二万斤小米。（四）甚至有的在糊涂思想支配之下，鼓动商人反对税局。如邯郸专区邱县工商科乔科长在征收第一季工商业税时，鼓动商人质问税局。像这些情况，该省多数专区中或多或少地存在着，而其中最严重的要算通县专区房山县县长杜恩林了。他对于税务工作的指示法令，表示冷淡，这类文件发来时，他说：“这是你们（指税局）的文件，自己去办吧！”对于税务干部的生命也是很不关心。今年一月二十三日，该县税局驻长沽峪东矿煤厂的驻厂员康淮解款回县局，路过车山口关帝庙时，不幸被特务杀害。次日该县税局局长杨复理把这件事报告他，他不但没有表示丝毫关心，反而责备杨复理道：“谁让他去征税呢？你们向人家要钱，人家还不打死你们？”把国家的税收工作，糊涂地认做是“向人家要钱”，这里代表着一种典型的错误认识。
    由于这些领导干部轻视税务工作，打击了许多税务干部的工作情绪，严重地影响了税收任务的完成。如房山县去年只完成税收任务的百分之七十左右即可证明。这些错误思想必须及时的适当的给以批评和纠正。
