Beijing's Bamiancao Adds Postal Branch

[This newspaper dispatch] Since the opening of the Wangfujing postal kiosk, business has been very developed. However, due to the small kiosk address, it is impossible to add services such as parcel remittance, which has caused much inconvenience to the public. In order to meet the needs of local citizens, the Beijing Postal Administration has decided to change the original Bamiancao Postal Remittance Bureau office into a postal branch starting today (the 1st), handling all postal services, and will cancel the Wangfujing postal kiosk from the same day.

　　京市八面槽添设邮政支局
    【本报讯】王府井邮亭开设以来，业务非常发达，惟以亭址狭小，无法添办包裹汇兑等项业务，公众多感不便。北京邮政管理局为了适应当地市民需要，决自今日（一日）起将原设八面糟之邮汇局办事处改为邮政支局，办理邮政一切业务，并自同日起取消王府井邮亭。
