Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th - In Mutual Assistance County, Qinghai Province, grassroots rural democratic governments have been fully established based on the mobilization of the masses during grain collection. The entire county now has thirty-three townships, one hundred thirty-six administrative villages, and six hundred eighty-two natural villages that have held elections for village and township cadres. In Hui and Tibetan ethnic areas, or areas with mixed ethnicities, a large number of ethnic minority cadres have been elected. For example, in Fanghui Canal Township, Hunshui Gully, and Xishan Township, thirty-four Hui cadres were elected, while in Bazha Guo and Jiading Township, thirty-seven Tibetan cadres were elected. The elected village and township government cadres are all activists who gained the support of the people during the grain collection work. In some areas where the masses were not well mobilized during grain collection, and therefore the elections were not democratic enough, re-elections were held during the review of public grain. The peasant masses are very active and earnest in the elections. For example, in Zongzhai Township, approximately four hundred people from the entire township participated in the election meeting. At the meeting, everyone exposed the crimes of the old township head's embezzlement and extortion, and happily presented flowers to the new township head with gongs and drums. In order to further improve the ability of these new cadres to serve the people, the county people's government specifically held a centralized training session for township heads last month, and decided that each district should be responsible for the centralized training of administrative village directors, natural village heads, farmers' association and militia cadres. The training focused on the fundamental differences between the work styles of the new cadres and the old township heads and Baojia chiefs, as well as specific issues such as how to organize and lead the masses in production.

　　青海互助县在征粮中发动群众
    乡村民主政权建立   
    选出大批少数民族干部
    【新华社西安七日电】青海互助县乡村基层民主政权，已在征粮工作中发动群众的基础上，全部建立起来。全县现已有三十三个乡，一百三十六个行政村，六百八十二个自然村举行了乡村干部的选举。在回、藏民族地区或各民族杂居地区，选出了大批少数民族的干部。如芳惠渠乡、浑水沟、西山乡等地选出回民干部三十四人，巴扎郭、嘉定乡等地选出藏民干部三十七人。被选出的乡村政权干部，都是在征粮工作中获得人民拥护的积极分子。部分地区由于在征粮工作中没有很好发动群众因而选举不够民主的，在复查公粮中，又进行了改选。农民群众对选举非常积极认真。如总寨乡全乡约四百人都参加了选举会。会上，大家揭露了旧乡长贪污敲诈的罪恶，并敲锣打鼓给新乡长戴花。为了进一步提高这批新干部为人民服务的办事能力，该县人民政府特于上月集中训练各乡乡长，并决定由各区负责集训行政村主任、自然村长、农会和民兵干部。训练内容以新干部和旧乡保甲长工作作风的根本区别，以及如何组织和领导群众进行生产等具体问题为主。
