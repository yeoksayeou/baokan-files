　　Two Problems of the Tangshan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Organizing Disaster Victims for Production and Self-Salvation
    Kang Weizhong
    After the Tangshan Special District suffered wind and flood disasters in October of last year, the business policy of the district's Supply and Marketing Cooperative changed to organizing disaster victims for production and self-salvation. According to statistics at the end of February, a total of 98 district and village cooperatives were organized, absorbing 135,852 members with shares equivalent to 1,323,658 jin of millet. This played a significant role in supporting the development of various sideline productions among the disaster-stricken masses. Taking weaving as an example, in Yuutian, Luanan, Fengrun, and Leting counties alone, over 12,000 looms were restored, accounting for 38% of all looms in the four counties. In January and February, cooperatives in various regions purchased a total of 124,244 bolts of homespun cloth, each bolt yielding a profit of 15 jin of millet, enabling disaster victims to obtain 1,863,660 jin of millet. Considerable progress has also been made in organizing other sideline productions, such as mat weaving, spinning, saltpeter boiling, and transportation. However, these achievements are still far from meeting the needs of the masses in the district to overcome the spring famine. To further organize disaster victims for production and self-salvation, two issues are worth studying and improving.
  (1) The Integration of Cooperative Organization and Business
    Except for two newly established ones, the cooperatives in the thirteen counties of the Tangshan Special District were all transformed from the former Jidong State-Owned Stores. Therefore, at the beginning of the transformation, they were only accustomed to buying and selling, neglecting the work of organizing cooperatives through business operations. For example, before August of last year, a district cooperative in Luannan had a business turnover of 171,440 jin of millet, but only 653 members were absorbed, with shares amounting to 6,530 jin of millet. The development of cooperative organization and business operations was extremely unbalanced, leading to a disconnect between production and distribution. For example, in February of this year, the Fifth District Cooperative of Luannan County launched a campaign to encourage the masses to participate in spinning production through a grain-for-thread exchange program. However, after the business took off, it neglected to establish grassroots organizations of village cooperatives, leaving the district cooperative in a vulnerable position, isolated and without support. When a large amount of spun thread was continuously transported from the countryside to the district cooperative, the cadres of the district cooperative were overwhelmed, so busy that they didn't even have time to eat. The peasants who delivered the thread had to wait one or two days before completing the exchange procedures. As a result, not only could the district cooperative not carefully check the quality of the finished products due to the rush, but it also wasted a lot of manpower from the masses, greatly affecting their production. At the same time, some county cooperative leaders did not pay attention to cooperative organization work at all, thinking that the cooperative was just providing some cheap things to the masses and that was the end of it. For example, all the cooperative organization cadres of the Lulong County Cooperative were solely engaged in business operations. As a result, after developing 170 members in November of last year, they did not develop a single member in the three months until the end of February of this year. According to statistics at the end of February, the establishment of district cooperatives only accounted for 45% of all districts, and village cooperatives only accounted for 0.6% of the total number of villages. Members only accounted for 3.3% of the total population of the special district. There were also individual cooperatives that paid more attention to cooperative organization work, but the development of business operations did not keep up, making the establishment of cooperatives a mere formality. For example, the Changli County Cooperative had developed 21,521 members, but did not organize the masses to engage in various sideline productions based on local production conditions. The cooperative only supplied the masses with daily necessities such as matches and soap. Therefore, some members requested to withdraw their shares.
    The experience of the Tangshan Special District Cooperative proves that only by closely integrating cooperative organization work with supply and marketing business can we fully mobilize the masses, organize production, and develop supply and marketing business. The Yuutian County Cooperative has now created a relatively complete experience. On the basis of the local existing sideline productions such as spinning, mat weaving, and transportation, it focuses on combining the establishment of village cooperatives or production teams, strengthening leadership and organizing the masses for production. This not only developed 22,196 members, but also truly mobilized the masses for production and self-salvation, enabling the smooth development of supply and marketing business.
  (2) Two Deviations in Management Thinking
    There are two different deviations in the thinking of Tangshan Special District Cooperative cadres regarding business operations. 60% to 70% of the cooperative cadres in the district are former cadres of the Jidong State-Owned Stores, and remnants of a purely profit-seeking perspective still exist in their minds. For example, in July of last year, in order to seek huge profits, the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 980 bolts of cloth from Tianjin and transported them to the Northeast for sale, earning a profit of over 224,900 jin of millet, but never planned how to support the masses in developing textile production. The special district cooperative also transported a large number of materials back from the city, but rarely supplied them to the grassroots members of the cooperatives at all levels (at that time, the actual number of members developed was also very small), and mostly sold them on the market. In addition, there was also a phenomenon of mutual competition for profits among various cooperatives. For example, when the special district cooperative wholesale various goods to lower-level cooperatives, it had to extract a 15% profit. Lower-level cooperatives felt that it was cheaper to buy on the market, so many county cooperatives bought on the market, affecting market prices. After October of last year, after the superior cooperative pointed out that this practice of the Tangshan Special District Cooperative lacked a perspective of serving the masses, and reminded the cooperative that its central task in the future was to cooperate with disaster area production and self-salvation, and support various sideline productions, the cadres of the Tangshan Special District Cooperative at all levels did not fully understand this spirit, and another extreme arose - a non-business perspective of bestowing favors. This is primarily reflected in the fact that when cooperatives organize the masses for production and solve the problems of production funds and raw materials, in addition to the government and economic departments providing necessary and active help, not enough effort is made to implement production self-salvation and rely on and mobilize the masses for mutual assistance, and there is a considerable degree of dependence among cadres and the masses. According to the materials of the Sixth District Cooperative of Fengnan County, 81% of the total cooperative's working capital is supported by the public. The masses are indifferent to the cooperative's capital issues, which affects the consolidation and development of the cooperative. For example, when the Leting County Cooperative loaned thread to disaster victims for weaving, due to insufficient ideological mobilization, the masses' enthusiasm for weaving was not high, which affected the turnover of funds. Secondly, the policy of small profits and quick turnover was not seriously implemented in business operations. In many areas, cooperatives had a narrow mass perspective when purchasing products, infinitely buying the masses' products at high prices, which increased costs, affected the sales of products, greatly hindered the masses from continuing and expanding reproduction, and damaged the long-term interests of the masses. The Qian'an County Cooperative is the most typical example. In February of this year, the cooperative purchased locally produced "Sanwu Mao Paper." The market price at the time of purchase was 400 jin of millet per piece, but the cooperative raised it to 660 jin, and later lowered it to 570 jin for purchase. Seeing that this production had high profits, the masses scrambled to engage in it, and those who were originally engaged in other sideline productions also switched to this industry. The original 98 papermaking households suddenly increased to 158 households. As a result, due to the high price of paper, the 300 pieces of paper purchased by the cooperative could not be sold, not only could the masses' production not continue, but the cooperative also accumulated funds, causing unnecessary losses. Similar phenomena exist in many cooperatives in the Tangshan Special District. Some cooperatives should purchase everything, otherwise, they believe that the mass perspective is not strong. For example, the Leting County Cooperative purchased coffins, wooden forks, brooms, and broken things (the General Cooperative has instructed to correct this), causing funds to be accumulated, affecting the support of other sideline productions.
    At present, the Party, government, and cooperatives at all levels in the Tangshan Special District are inspecting and correcting the above-mentioned problems. Under the call of "everyone running the cooperative," the cooperative cause in the Tangshan Special District is embarking on a path of normal development.

　　唐山专区供销合作社  在组织灾民生产自救中的两个问题
    康伟中
    唐山专区自去年十月遭受风灾、水灾后，该区供销合作总社的业务方针便转变为组织灾民生产自救。据二月底统计，共组织区、村合作社九十八个，吸收社员十三万五千八百五十二人；股金折小米一百三十二万三千六百五十八斤。对于扶植灾区群众各种副业生产上，起了很大的作用。以织布为例：单就玉田、滦南、丰润、乐亭四县来说，就恢复了织布机一万二千余架，占四县全部织布机的百分之三十八。各地合作社在一、二月份共收购土布十二万四千二百四十四匹，每匹布可得利润小米十五斤，灾民可获小米一百八十六万三千六百六十斤。对组织其他各种副业生产，如织席、纺线、熬硝及运输等，都已获得相当成绩。但这些成绩，距离目前该区群众渡过春荒的要求还很远。为进一步组织灾民生产自救，有两个问题是值得研究改进的。
  （一）组社和业务结合问题
    唐山专区十三个县合作社除二个系新建立者外，其余都是由原冀东国营商店改造过来的。故在改造之初，只习惯于买进卖出的业务经营，而忽视了从经营中组织合作社的工作。如就去年八月份以前滦南一个区合作社来看，业务经营的数字达十七万一千四百四十斤小米，但仅吸收社员六百五十三人，股金六千五百三十斤小米。组社工作和业务经营两者的发展极不平衡，而使生产和分配工作陷于脱节。如滦南县五区合作社今年二月份在以粮换线的方式下，发动群众参加纺线生产，业务开展起来后，却忽视了建立村合作社的基层组织，致使区社陷于裸体跳舞，孤立无援的地步。当大批纺线源源从农村运来区社时，区社干部应接不暇，忙得连吃饭的功夫都没有，而送线的农民等了一两天还不能完成交换手续。结果不仅区社因忙乱不能详细检查成品质量，且浪费了群众许多人力，影响群众生产甚大。同时，有些县社的领导上根本就不重视组社工作，认为合作社只是给群众供给点便宜东西就算完事。如卢龙县合作社所有的组社干部都单搞业务经营，因而自去年十一月份发展一百七十个社员以后，到今年二月底三个月中，没发展一个社员。据二月底统计，该区各级合作社除县社已普遍建立外，区社的建立只占所有区数的百分之四十五，村社只占整个村数的百分之○点六，社员只占全专区人数的百分之三点三。也有个别社对组社工作比较重视，但业务的开展却没有跟得上来，使合作社的建立流于形式。如昌黎县合作社已发展社员两万一千五百二十一名，但没根据当地生产条件，组织群众搞各种副业生产；合作社仅仅供给群众一些火柴、肥皂等日用品。因此有社员要求退股的现象发生。
    唐山专区社的经验证明：唯有使组社工作紧紧地与供销业务相结合，才能充分地发动群众，组织生产，开展供销业务。玉田县社现已创造了比较完整的经验，在当地纺织、织席和运输等原有的副业生产基础上，有重点地结合建立村社或生产小组，加强领导与组织群众生产，不仅发展了二万二千一百九十六名社员，而且真正发动了群众生产自救，使供销业务顺利发展。
  （二）经营思想上的两种偏向
    唐山专区合作社干部对经营业务在思想上相当普遍的存在着两种不同的偏向。该区合作干部，百分之六十至七十均为原冀东国营商店的干部，思想上尚存在着单纯营利观点的残余。如去年七月份专区供销总社为了图谋厚利，曾从天津收买大布九百八十匹，运往东北出卖，获利二十二万四千九百余斤小米，但从不计划如何去扶植群众发展纺织生产。该专区社从城市运回大量物资，也很少供给各级社的基层社员（当时实际发展社员也很少），大多数抛售在市场上。此外，还有各社间互相争利的现象。如专区社将各种物品批发给下级社时，须抽百分之十五的利润。下级社感到不如在市场购买来得便宜，因此不少县社到市场购买，影响市场物价。去年十月以后，经上级社指出唐山专区社这种作法，缺乏为群众服务的观点，并提示该社以后的中心任务，是配合灾区生产自救，扶植各种副业生产。但唐山专区各级社的干部对这个精神了解不足，又产生了另一极端——恩赐的非经营的观点。这首先表现在合作社组织群众生产，解决生产资金和原料上，除政府及经济部门作必要和积极的帮助解决外，在贯彻生产自救，依靠与发动群众互助，必需大家想办法做得极不够。干部和群众存在着相当严重的依赖思想。根据丰南县六区社的材料证明，全部合作社的活动资金，百分之八十一是由公家支持的。群众对合作社的资金问题漠不关心，影响了合作社的巩固与发展。如乐亭县合作社贷线给灾民织布，由于思想动员不够，群众织布情绪不高，因而影响资金周转。其次，在经营上执行薄利广销的方针亦未认真贯彻。不少地区的合作社在收购产品时存在着狭隘的群众观点，无限度的高价收买群众产品，致使成本提高，影响了产品的销路，大大妨碍了群众继续和扩大再生产，破坏了群众的长远利益。迁安县社就是最典型的例子。该社于今年二月收购当地所产之“三五毛纸”，收购时市价为每件四百斤小米，但合作社提高到六百六十斤，后来又落价到五百七十斤收购。群众看到这种生产利润高，即争相经营，原来搞其他副业生产的也纷纷转入此业。原有造纸业九十八户，突增到一百五十八户。结果，因纸价过高，合作社收购之三百件纸都推销不出，不仅群众生产不能继续，合作社亦积压了资金，造成了不应有的损失。类似的现象，在唐山专区不少的合作社中存在着。有些合作社不管什么都应收购，否则便认为群众观点不强。如乐亭县合作社收购棺材、木杈子、扫帚和破烂的东西等（总社已指示纠正），使资金积压起来，影响扶植其他副业生产。
    目前，唐山专区党、政及各级合作社对上述问题已进行检查纠正；在“大家办社”的号召下，唐山专区的合作事业正走上正常发展的途径。
