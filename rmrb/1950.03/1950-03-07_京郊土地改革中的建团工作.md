　　Building the Youth League in the Land Reform of Beijing Suburbs
　　Youth League Beijing Suburban Work Committee
　　Ninety-six villages in the suburbs of the capital have victoriously completed land reform and established the Youth League during the land reform. Currently, a total of 1,805 Youth League members have been developed, and 86 branches have been established. According to statistics from 30 villages that have undergone land reform, youth account for 15.43% of the total population, and Youth League members account for 1.14% of the total number of youth.

　　When land reform began, after conducting education on peasant emancipation and suburban land reform policies, the youth cadres of the work teams mobilized the broad masses of youth to participate in farmers' associations, uniting them with the entire peasantry to fight against reactionary landlords and carry out land reform.

　　　　Enlighten Awareness, Mobilize Youth

　　Regarding mobilizing youth, the northern suburbs enlightened the youth's ideological awareness through various meetings. In villages such as Xinguang in the southern suburbs and Shuanghuaishu in the western suburbs, activists were first used to influence and unite young peasants. In Fengtai District, the farmers' association first made broad appeals, and village cadres mobilized their own children to participate in the farmers' association, taking the lead in promoting it. In villages such as Baijia Village, Mentou Village, and Dayu Village in Mentougou in the western suburbs, they started with learning, linking literacy classes with central tasks and conducting class education. Each district's farmers' association has a youth committee member; young peasants are mixed with middle-aged and elderly peasants in groups, so that the enthusiasm and courage of young people can be combined with the experience of older people. However, when special issues concerning youth arise, the youth committee member should convene youth meetings (or youth group meetings) for discussion and activities. A few villages separately and rigidly grouped youth, or conversely, ignored the characteristics of youth and only mixed them into groups without giving play to their active role, which will disperse and weaken the forces for land reform.

　　During the land reform movement, once young peasants are mobilized, their enthusiasm is very high. For example, youths in Jiugong in the southern suburbs monitored the activities of landlords day and night, and when landlord Zhang Wenlu attempted to escape, he was stopped by the youth; Xu Zhengjin, a youth from Xidi River in the northern suburbs, disregarded personal feelings and pointed out that his uncle was a landlord in the class designation group meeting; young peasants in Xiaohongmen in the southern suburbs completed the survey and registration of agricultural implements for the entire village under two surprise tasks; and youths in Dayu Village in Mentougou combined land reform with performing Yangko operas to publicize policies. Experience has proven that the village that fully mobilizes its youth does a better job in land reform.

　　　　Conduct Propaganda, Begin Building the League

　　With the improvement of the peasants' class consciousness, propaganda work on the Youth League was carried out. The southern suburbs linked it to the central task, clearly pointing out to the youth that the Youth League is under the leadership of the Communist Party and uses infinite loyalty to complete the task of land reform, and that Youth League members should actively participate in labor production and strive to learn culture. In Juzi Fang in the eastern suburbs, a forum for parents was held, explaining that joining the League would teach children to be good, which dispelled the parents' concerns. Young peasants had the idea of being conscripted into the army upon joining the League, which was also dispelled after strengthening class education and explaining the current domestic situation. Some villages announced the list of applicants for the League at mass meetings to solicit the opinions of the masses on these people, so the peasants knew that joining the League was glorious. In Fengtai District, the story of Li Hu joining the League was used to further explain the nature, work, and tasks of the League, and to specifically publicize the exemplary deeds of League members in various places, which had a good effect. Generally, each village conducts propaganda step by step through various meetings, recreational activities, literacy classes, etc., not only to young people, but also to middle-aged and elderly people.

　　With the development of the land reform movement and the widespread publicity of the Youth League's work, various districts actively began to build the League. The eastern suburbs and other districts first cultivated candidates for League membership and conducted individual talks. The southern suburbs established League organizations after class designation and absorbed active youth who participated in land reform. The Youth League in Mentougou District was established in conjunction with class designation and land distribution. The criteria for absorbing League members in each district were based on ideological progress and active participation in land reform work. The methods of developing League members generally involve steps such as the League members themselves applying, individual development, soliciting mass opinions, approval by the Party organization of the work team (the League District Working Committee entrusts the Party organization of the work team to be responsible, but should report to the League District Working Committee every month), and holding an admission ceremony. The method of absorbing League members in the western suburbs is: the first batch of League members are introduced by Party and League members in the work team, and the second batch is introduced by the first batch of officially developed League members. The admission ceremony in Longquanwu Village in Mentougou was simple and grand, with preparations made in advance, and more than 200 people participated in the meeting, which improved the masses' understanding of the League. In Liulangzhuang in the western suburbs, a formal League branch was elected and established before the work team left, which increased the League branch's prestige and enabled the League's work to continue smoothly.

　　　　Strengthen Leadership, Deepen Education

　　The established rural League branches must be strengthened in leadership. In order to strengthen education work, the League Suburban Working Committee mobilized 80 student League members from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University and other schools to go to the countryside during the winter vacation to carry out education work in the League branches. While land reform has not ended, each district has assigned dedicated personnel to lead the established League branches.

　　After the League was established, the masses had a good response to the League: Li, an old lady from Sancha River in the eastern suburbs, said: "After my son joined the League, he no longer loses his temper when he comes home. I must let my daughter strive to join the League too." Xie, a League member from Yinghai Village in the southern suburbs, said: "In the past, my son did not engage in production and loved to spend money. Since the Communist Party came, he has become actively engaged in work and labors at home every day. Now that he has joined the Youth League, I am even more relieved."

　　Currently, in the villages where land reform has ended, the central task of the League has shifted to winter schools, winter prevention, and preparing for spring agricultural production and sideline production work. League members have also played an exemplary role in winter schools, winter prevention, and sideline production. In Liulangzhuang in the western suburbs, the group leaders and class leaders in winter schools are all League members. The principals and vice principals of the winter school in Bagou Village are Guan Zongyin and Li Wenda, the secretaries of the village's League branch. They are enthusiastic and responsible, which has improved the Youth League's prestige among the masses. In Changxindian, Beigangwa, Zhangguozhuang, Xinzhuang and other villages, more than 120 young people participated in winter prevention, winning the praise of the broad masses.

　　Some deviations also occurred in the work of building the League in land reform: such as (1) Insufficient publicity of the Youth League. (2) Detaching from the work of land reform and building the League solely for the sake of building the League. (3) Standards for absorbing League members are too high (such as new League members in the northern suburbs generally have a probationary period of three to five or six months). Some of these shortcomings have been corrected, and some are being corrected.

　　京郊土地改革中的建团工作
    青年团北京市郊区工作委员会
    首都郊区已有九十六个村庄，胜利地完成土地改革。并在土地改革中建立了青年团。目前共发展团员一千八百零五人，建立了八十六个支部。根据三十个进行了土地改革村庄的统计，青年占总人口百分之一五点四三，青年团员占青年总数的百分之一一点一四。
    土地改革开始，在进行了农民翻身和郊区土地改革政策教育之后，工作组的青年干部，便发动广大青年参加农会，使他们与整个农民团结在一起，与反动地主作斗争，进行土地改革。
            启发觉悟  发动青年
    在发动青年的方式上，北郊通过各种会议，启发青年的思想觉悟。南郊新宫、西郊双槐树等村，首先通过积极分子，去影响和团结青年农民。丰台区先由农会广泛号召，村干部发动自己子弟参加农会，带头推动。西郊白家村、门头村、门头沟大峪村等村，从学习下手，将识字班与中心工作联系起来，进行阶级教育。各区农会中皆设有青年委员；青年农民与中年、老年农民混合编组，这样可以使青年人的热情和勇气与老年人的经验结合起来。但遇有有关青年的特殊问题时，青年委员应召开青年会议（或青年小组会）进行讨论和活动。个别村庄把青年单独固定编组，或相反地忽视青年的特点，只是混合编组而不去发挥青年的积极作用，这样都将分散和削弱了进行土地改革的力量。
    在土地改革运动中，青年农民一经发动起来，积极性是很高的。如南郊旧宫青年不分昼夜监视地主活动，地主张文禄企图逃跑，被青年拦回；北郊西堤河青年徐正进不顾私人情面，在划阶级小组会上，指出他舅父是地主成份；南郊小红门青年农民在两次突击任务下，完成了全村农具调查与登记的工作；门头沟大峪村青年结合土地改革，演出秧歌剧，宣传政策。经验证明，那个村充分发动了青年，那个村的土地改革工作就显得更好。
            进行宣传  开始建团
    随着农民的阶级觉悟的提高，便进行关于青年团的宣传工作。南郊联系中心工作，明确的向青年指出青年团是在共产党领导下，以无限忠心来完成土地改革任务，团员要积极劳动生产，努力学习文化。东郊驹子房召开了家长座谈会，讲明入团是教孩子们学好，解除了家长的顾虑。青年农民对入团有怕当兵的思想，在加强阶级教育及讲明目前国内局势后，也消除了他们的顾虑。有些村庄在群众大会上，宣布申请入团者名单，征求群众对这些人的意见，农民因此知道入团是光荣的，丰台区由李虎入团的故事，深入一步讲解团的性质，团的工作与任务，并具体宣传各地团员的模范事迹，得到很好的效果。各村一般都通过各种会议，文娱活动、识字班等方式，有步骤地进行宣传，不仅向青年人宣传，而且向中年人、老年人宣传。
    随着土地改革运动与广泛宣传青年团的工作的展开，各区积极着手建团。东郊等区先培养了建团对象，进行个别谈话。南郊则在划阶级后建立团的组织，吸收土地改革中的积极青年参加。门头沟区的青年团是结合划阶级及分配土地等工作建立的。吸收团员的条件，各区都是以思想进步，积极参加土地改革工作为标准。发展团员的方式：一般都经过团员自己申请，个别发展，征求群众意见，工作组党的组织批准（团区工委委托工作组党的组织负责，但每月应向团区工委报告），举行入团仪式等步骤。西郊吸收团员的办法是：第一批团员由工作组中的党团员作介绍人，第二批则由第一批发展的正式团员作介绍人。门头沟龙泉坞村入团仪式简朴隆重，首先作了准备，开会时有二百多人参加，提高了群众对团的认识。西郊六郎庄在工作组离开前，即选举成立正式团支部，使团支部威信增高。团的工作能继续顺利地进行。
            加强领导  深入教育
    对已建立起的农村团支部必须加强领导。团郊区工委为加强教育工作，寒假期中，曾发动北大、清华、燕大等校八十个学生团员下乡去作团支部的教育工作。在土地改革未结束期间，各区设专人领导已建立了的团支部。
    团建立之后，群众对团都有很好的反映：东郊三岔河李老太太说：“我儿子入团后，回家来也不发脾气了。我的闺女也得让她争取入团。”南郊瀛海庄团员谢思惠的母亲说：“从前我儿子不生产，爱花钱，共产党来了，他就变得工作积极，每天在家劳动，现在又参加了青年团，我就更放心了。”
    目前在土地改革结束的村庄，团的中心工作已转入冬学、冬防，准备春季农业生产及副业生产工作。团员在冬学、冬防及副业生产中也都起了模范作用。西郊六郎庄冬学中的组长、班长都是团员担任，巴沟村冬学的正副校长由该村团支部书记管宗印、李文达担任，他们热心负责，提高了青年团在群众中的威信。长辛店、北岗洼、张郭庄、辛庄等村，有一百二十余青年参加冬防，博得广大群众的好评。
    土地改革中的建团工作也发生一些偏向：如（一）对青年团的宣传不够。（二）脱离土地改革的工作，去单独为建团而建团。（三）吸收团员标准过高（如北郊新团员一般都有三个月至五六个月的候补期）。这些缺点有的已经纠正，有的正在纠正中。
