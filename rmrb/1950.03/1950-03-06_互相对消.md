　　“Mutually Cancel Out”
    Yan Ling
    The Soviet Union's third decision to reduce state-owned trade retail prices and increase the ruble's exchange rate with foreign currencies has stunned the imperialists.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder said such insane things: "I believe that the increase in the price of the ruble and the decrease in prices almost mutually cancel each other out." Ah, one "increase" and one "decrease," just looking at these two words, aren't they "mutually canceling each other out?" One plus one minus, equals no decrease and no increase, the Treasury Secretary's mathematics is truly brilliant. But, do the increase in currency value and the decrease in prices "mutually cancel each other out?" A three-year-old child can answer this question.
    There are more wonderful theories, one of the spokesmen for the American financial oligarchs, The New York Times, said: "The decoupling of the ruble from the dollar is itself a fiction, because the Soviet Union links its currency to gold, which also links its currency to something whose price is ultimately determined by the dollar." People want to ask, what determines the price of the dollar? The New York Times will surely tell you again: the price of the dollar is determined by the amount of gold it contains according to regulations. Then, according to the same logic of the New York Times, we can also say: since the dollar is determined by gold, it is also determined by the ruble.
    At the same time, many imperialist mouthpieces contradict The New York Times. They say: the ruble has no connection with the world market at all, so it "does not have any impact on the dollar and pound in international exchange and world trade." But United Press International simultaneously said: "The United States also uses dollars to purchase goods from the Soviet Union." So, when paying in dollars, those who used to pay a thousand dollars are now afraid that they won't be able to buy it with a thousand dollars, right? Does this have any impact on world trade after all?
    There is another wonderful theory, which says that Soviet prices were originally too high and had to be lowered. Otherwise, Soviet workers would not be able to get the necessities that American and Western European workers can get. But what is the reality? Let's take a look at what the Moscow Central Department Store sold on the first day of the price reduction—large quantities of silks, watches, radios, carpets, cameras, and perfumes. This shows what the living standards of Soviet workers were like before the price reduction. There are indeed some things that American and Western European workers can get that Soviet workers cannot, and that is unemployment, hunger, and persecution.
    It is precisely the imperialists' ravings in panic and helplessness that "mutually cancel out" their deceptive effect on their own people and the people of all countries.

### “互相对消”

　　“互相对消”
    燕凌
    苏联第三次减低国营贸易零售物价及提高卢布与外币兑换率的决定，把帝国主义者们打昏了。
    美国财政部长斯奈德说了这样的疯话：“我相信，卢布的价格提高与物价的减低差不多互相对消了。”是啊，一个“提高”，一个“减低”，就这两个字样说，不是“互相对消”了吗？一加一减，等于不减不加，财政部长的数学是够高明的。可是，币值的提高与物价的减低是不是“互相对消”了呢？三岁小孩子也能回答这问题。
    妙论还有的是，美国金融寡头的代言者之一《纽约时报》说：“卢布与美元脱离联系本身就是一个虚构，因为苏联把她的通货与黄金联系也就把其通货与一种东西联系，这种东西的价格最后仍然是由美元来决定。”人们要问，美元的价格是由什么决定的呢？《纽约时报》一定会再告诉你：美元的价格是由其按规定所含的黄金量来决定的。那么，依照纽约时报同样的逻辑，我们就也可以这样说：美元既是由黄金所决定，就也是由卢布来决定。
    而同时许多帝国主义者的喉舌却又和《纽约时报》的说法发生矛盾。他们说：卢布和世界市场根本毫无关系，所以“对美元、英镑在国际汇兑在世界贸易往来方面不发生任何影响。”而合众社同时却又说：“美国向苏联购货亦用美元付款”。那么，用美元付款时，过去要付一千美元的，以后怕拿一千美元就买不到手了吧？这于世界贸易来往究竟是发生了影响没有呢？
    还有一个妙论，是说苏联过去物价本来就过高，不得不降低。不然，苏联工人就得不到美国和西欧工人所能得到的必需品。而事实是怎样的呢？我们看看莫斯科中央百货商店在减价第一天卖出了些什么吧——大量的丝织品、表、无线电机、地毯、照像机和香水。这说明在减价之前苏联工人们的生活水平到底是怎样的。美国和西欧工人确实有些东西是苏联工人得不到的，那就是失业、饥饿与受迫害。
    正是帝国主义者在惊惶与无奈中所说的一些胡言乱语，把它们对其本国和各国人民的欺骗作用“互相对消”了。
