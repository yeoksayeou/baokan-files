　　On the Translation of Western Personal and Place Names
    Guan Zhaozhi
    Translating personal and place names naturally requires preserving the original sound. Every language has its unique pronunciation. It is impossible to faithfully represent the sounds of Western languages using Chinese characters; even using French to represent English sounds presents unavoidable difficulties. For instance, French cannot represent the English 'r' sound or the short 'u' sound. However, striving to preserve the closest possible pronunciation is still necessary. Because Western European languages use the same alphabet, they typically preserve the original spelling when referring to each other. For example, German preserves the original spelling and pronunciation when citing British or French names. However, when Russian cites English, German, or French personal or place names, or vice versa, it is impossible to write the original words because the alphabets are fundamentally different. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the method of preserving the original sound. In earlier years, especially before the October Revolution, Russian science learned from Germany and France, so many scientists' names, when written in Latin letters, were universally spelled in French or German. Many people who only knew English and not German or French made many mistakes when reading these names.
    In the past twenty years or so, due to the semi-colonial social atmosphere, English became fashionable, and many people, when they thought of foreign languages, immediately thought of English, as if English were the only foreign language. Many translators, without doing research, arbitrarily translated, making the translation of personal and place names even worse and irretrievable. For example, the French puppet regime during World War II should be called the "Vichy" government, but newspapers in the rear areas of China at that time mostly translated it as Vichy. Another example is the leader of the Italian Communist Party, formerly translated as Tao Geliati (now corrected to Togliatti, which is correct). Another example is the great Soviet biologist Lysenko, who many people translated as Lysenko, obviously according to the English pronunciation. Even some experienced translators sometimes make mistakes carelessly. In translating personal and place names, some precedents are worth emulating. An older one is the Mandarin version of the "Bible." The book itself is not worth promoting, and its translation is also poor, but it is very faithful in translating personal and place names. Many friends who only know English often ask why Jesus, Jacob, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, etc., are translated in this way. In fact, as long as you know some Latin pronunciation, it is not surprising. In recent years, the translation of Russian place and personal names has also been more cautious. Many early translations of personal names, such as Don Quixote translated as Dong Jike De, also faithfully preserved the Spanish pronunciation.
    Some people may ask: "Does that mean that you are not qualified to translate unless you understand all the languages in the world?" I think that doing anything should be honest, the so-called "to know what you know, and to not know what you do not know." Translation, like writing, must be responsible to hundreds of millions of readers. If you do not know enough languages, you should study hard, ask people, and look up dictionaries. In any case, you should know what language the name to be translated is and how this language should be pronounced. If you are unwilling to ask people or look up dictionaries, and pretend to know what you do not know, translating everything based on a smattering of English, this is an irresponsible attitude and is unfair to readers.
    We should establish certain rules in the translation of personal and place names. According to the situation in various countries in the past, as mentioned above, there is no fixed rule for translating from Russian into English, German, and French, and as a result, it is always unclear how the original word should be read. Recently, due to the rapid development of Soviet science, American imperialists have paid great attention to the situation and publications of the Soviet academic community. Especially in American mathematical review journals, in order to regularly introduce a large number of Soviet mathematical papers, a certain letter comparison method has been adopted. Thus, any Russian personal or place name can be immediately written in Latin letters according to this comparison table (naturally, one must understand its special pronunciation), and conversely, it can be restored from English to Russian. For example, there are also certain rules for translating Japanese into Western languages. Its pronunciation is not exactly the same as that of general Western languages, but as long as you know its comparison method, you can restore the Western language to Japanese kana. Also, in China, there are some rules for translating Russian personal names in recent years. For example, common sounds such as "rov" and "ski" have certain spellings, and no one would write them as "Le Fu" or "Siji." Referring to these facts, I think we should define a unified Chinese national phonetic alphabet correspondence for the spellings of various major Western languages. For example, German, French, and Spanish ba, Russian ба, etc., can all be translated as "Ba" instead of using words such as 霸 or 八; German pa, Russian па, etc., should be translated as Pa instead of also being translated as Ba. If there is no suitable corresponding sound in Chinese, then a relatively similar one should also be selected. For example, when translating the Spanish writer Cervantes, writing it as Sai Wan Ti Si, although there is no suitable Chinese sound for Spanish Cer, it is acceptable to define a more similar Sai. In particular, the sounds r and L are often indistinguishable to people in Jiangnan, and should also be represented by different characters. For example, L at the end of a sound should be read as "Le" and definitely not "Er", and special attention should be paid to this.
    In addition, I would like to say that Western personal names, in addition to the surname, have one or two given names, which are not given much attention in our translation. Since there are many people with the same surname but different given names, misinterpretations can easily occur if the translations are not distinguished. For example, someone once confused former French President Raymond Poincaré with the great mathematician Henri Poincaré. Sometimes the original text does not write the full name, but only writes the first letter of each word. When translating, if it is impossible to find the full name, how should those letters be translated? Or should the letters be retained (as is currently commonly used)? This should also be studied.

　　谈西文人名地名的翻译
    关肇直
    翻译人名地名，自然要保存原文的音。一种文字有一种特殊的发音。不但用中国文字忠实地表示西方语言的音是不可能，即使是用法文表示英语的音，已有很多不可避免的困难了。例如法文就无法表示英语的ｒ音，或短音的ｕ音等。但力求保存最近似的发音，还是应当做的。西欧文字因为用同样的字母，所以通常互相保存原来写法。如德文中引英国或法国人名，仍保存原字，并也应照原文发音。但如俄文中引英、德、法等国的人名地名或英、德、法文引俄国的人名地名时，则无法写原来的字，因为字母根本不同了。于是就必需采用保存原音的办法。但在早年，特别在十月革命之前，俄国科学方面是向德国法国学习的、所以很多科学家的名字用拉丁字母写时都一概用法文或德文拼法，而很多只识英文不懂德文法文的人就在读这些人名时弄出很多错误。
    近二十余年来，由于半殖民地的社会风气，以英文为时尚，很多人甚至一提外国文，心目中就想到英文，似乎英文是唯一的外国文。一般翻译工作者不加研究，任意译出，于是使人地译名越发糟到不可收拾的地步。如在第二次世界大战时法国伪政权应叫做“维喜”政府，而那时我国后方的报纸多半译成维琪。又如意大利共产党领袖，旧时译做陶格里亚蒂（今改做托格里亚蒂，就正确了）。又如苏联大生物学家李森科，很多人译成赖森科，显然是按英语发了音。甚至有些翻译有经验的人，有时也不小心而译错了。其实，在译人名地名方面，有些先例值得效法。比较老的一部就是官话本《圣经》。这本书本身并不值得提倡它的译笔也差得很，但唯独在译人名地名时却很忠实。许多只懂英文的朋友们常问耶稣、雅各、耶路撒冷、伯力恒等为什这样译？其实，只要晓得一些拉丁文的读音法也就无可惊异了。近年来译俄文地名人名也比较慎重。很多早年译出的一些人名，如唐吉诃德译成董吉诃德，也很忠实地保存了西班牙语音。
    有人会问：“难道不能遍懂世界上的语言就不配翻译了吗？”笔者以为，做什么事都要老老实实的，所谓“知之为知之，不知为不知”。翻译和写作一样，要对亿万读者负责。假如自己懂得文字不够多，应当好好学习、问人、查字典等等。无论如何应晓得所要译的名字是什么文，这种文应如何发音。假如既不肯问人，又不肯翻字典，强不知以为知，会两句英文就什么都乱翻一气，这是不负责任的态度，是对不起读者的。
    我们应在人名地名的翻译中建立起一定的规则来。按以往各国的情形，如以上所说，由俄文译成英、德、法文也都无定章，结果总是弄不清原来的字应如何读。最近，由于苏联科学的突飞猛进，美国帝国主义者非常注意苏联学术界的情形及出版物。特别在美国的数学论评期刊中，为了经常介绍大量的苏联数学论文，采取了一定的字母对照法。于是凡俄文人名地名不仅按这对照表立刻可以用拉丁字母写出（自然须了解其特殊发音），而反之也可以由英文还原成俄文。又如由日文译成西文也有一定的规则，其发音与一般西文都不尽同，但只要知道其对照法，就可以从西文回复到日文的假名。又在我国近年来译俄文人名方面也多少存在着一些定则，如“罗夫”、“斯基”等常见的音已有一定的写法，没有人会写成“乐父”、“司机”等。参照这些事实，笔者认为应当就西方各种主要语言的拼音定出划一的汉文国语音对照来。如德文法文西班牙文的ba，俄文的ба等，都可以译成“巴”，而不要用霸、八等字；德文的pa，俄文的па等则应译成帕，而不应又译成巴。如中文没有适合的相应音，则也应选定一个比较近似的；如译西班牙文豪Cervantes，写成塞万提斯，虽然西班牙语Cer中文无适当音，但定成较似的赛也过得去。特别是ｒ及Ｌ两音，江南人往往分不清楚，应当也用不同的字表示，例如Ｌ放在音尾应读如“勒”而绝非“尔”，应特别注意。
    又附带要说一下，就是西文人名除姓外，尚有一两字是名，我国翻译时不大注重。同姓异名者既多，译文不加区辨，容易发生误会。例如曾有人把前法国总统雷蒙·潘加赉和大数学家昂利·潘加赉相混。有时原文不书全名，只写各字的头一字母，在翻译时如无法查得全名，应如何翻译那些字母？或仍保留字母（如目前普遍采用的）？也应研究一下。
