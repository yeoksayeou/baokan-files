Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th – This year, the Northeast Military Region's troops will vigorously carry out production movements in conjunction with military training. At present, various production preparations are being stepped up and will soon enter the spring plowing season. In mid-January, the military region issued instructions on the 1950 agricultural production of the troops, stipulating that all troops should focus on agricultural production and complete the task of self-sufficiency for three months of food; troop agencies and schools without agricultural production tasks should also engage in sideline production as much as possible without hindering education and work. After more than a month of deliberation and mobilization based on the spirit of the instructions, the various units have generally established the idea of creating national wealth and improving the troops' lives through their own labor, and earnestly abiding by government laws and policies; and in individual troops, the erroneous view that production would hinder military training and cultural learning has been corrected. Now, all troops above the regiment level have successively established production committees, and supply departments above the division level have also added production sections to strengthen the specific leadership of production work. The organization of labor forces participating in production in various units has also been largely completed. Except for individual troops that have organized specialized production teams, with all personnel participating during the busy farming season, most troops rotate one battalion from each regiment to take on production tasks. Agencies and departments above the division level also appropriately transfer logistical personnel to engage in production.

According to the general production tasks stipulated by the military region, the specific production plans of various units have been formulated. In terms of agriculture, one unit plans to plant 79,600 mu of paddy fields and 93,785 mu of dry land this year. Another unit plans to form a production and construction battalion of 1,600 people, planning to cultivate 10,000 mu of land, which is expected to generate an annual income of 22.5 billion yuan (Northeast currency, the same below). In order to exceed the self-sufficiency task stipulated by the military region, another unit plans to cultivate 25,000 mu to 28,000 mu of land, striving for the troops to be self-sufficient in grain for three and a half months, and the agencies for one and a half months. In addition, various units will make full use of manpower and material resources to widely carry out sideline production. Many troops have independently stipulated the task of self-sufficiency in vegetables for two and a half months to half a year. Most units have also established military production and consumption cooperatives, tofu workshops, and mills, and launched the breeding of pigs, chickens, rabbits and other poultry and livestock, weaving mats and making ropes to improve the troops' lives.

The various units also plan to participate in various industrial and mining constructions according to their specific circumstances. One unit decided to participate in construction work with tens of thousands of workers, which is expected to generate an income of nearly 20 billion yuan. A unit stationed in Shenyang has organized a construction battalion, planning to work in the mines for six months, striving for an income of 6 billion yuan. Another unit plans to participate in water conservancy and highway construction projects with 100,000 workers. A unit of the Liaoxi Military Region decided to open two brick and tile kilns each. The troops of the Liaodong Military Region have also organized construction engineering teams, focusing on building barracks and equipment, and contracting repairs as a supplement. Under the leadership of the production committee, the various troops have been actively carrying out production preparations in the past month. In mid-January, a unit of the Liaoxi Military Region had sent people to the Panshan Farm to prepare to build houses, and organized vehicles to establish a transportation station to transport construction materials, agricultural tools, and seeds. The Supply Department of the Liaodong Military Region has formulated various budgets for the information needed for production, and is now preparing to purchase ten foreign plows, more than 40,000 jin of fertilizer powder, and more than 20,000 jin of rice seeds to distribute to various production troops for spring plowing.

　　东北军区部队即将开始春耕
    争取自给三个月食粮
    组织修建大队参加各项建设工程
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北军区各部队今年将结合练兵大力开展生产运动。目前各项生产准备工作正在加紧进行，即将进入春耕。一月中旬，军区发布的一九五○年部队农业生产的指示中，规定所有部队要以农业生产为主、完成自给三个月食粮的任务；没有农业生产任务的部队机关、学校，亦应在不妨碍教育和工作的条件下，尽量从事副业生产。各部根据指示的精神进行酝酿、动员，为时一月余，大体均初步树立了以自己劳动来创造国家财富、改善部队生活和切实遵守政府法令和政策的思想；并在个别部队中纠正了认为生产就会妨碍练兵和文化学习的错误观点。现在各部队团以上都先后成立了生产委员会，师以上供给部门并增设生产科，以加强生产工作的具体领导。各部参加生产的劳动力的组织工作亦已大体完成，除个别部队组织了专门的生产队，农忙时再由全体人员参加外，大多数部队均自各团中轮流抽调一个营担负生产任务。师以上机关部门亦适当抽调勤杂人员从事生产。
    根据军区规定的总的生产任务，各部具体的生产计划业已订出。在农业方面，某部今年计划种水田七万九千六百亩，旱田九万三千七百八十五亩。某部拟以一千六百人组成生产建设大队，计划种地一万亩，约可使全年收入达到二百二十五亿元（东北币，下同）。另部为了超过军区规定的自给任务，计划种地两万五千亩至两万八千亩，争取部队自给三个半月粮食，机关也自给一个半月的粮食。此外，各部将充分利用人力、物力，广泛进行副业生产。不少部队自行规定自给两个半月到半年菜蔬的任务，大部分单位并成立了军人生产消费合作社、豆腐房、磨坊，发动饲养猪、鸡、兔等家禽家畜，编席打绳，以改善部队生活。
    各部又根据具体情况，计划参加各种工矿建设。某部决定以若干万人工参加修建工作，预计可收入近二百亿元。驻沈阳某部已组织了修建大队，计划以六个月时间到矿山工作，争取收入六十亿元。另部拟以十万人工，参加水利和公路修建工程。辽西军区某部决定开砖瓦窑各两座。辽东军区各部队亦组织了修建工程队，以修建营房和用具为主，承揽包修为辅。在生产委员会领导之下，各部队月来积极进行生产准备工作。辽西军区某部一月中旬已派人到盘山农场筹盖房舍，并组织车辆成立运输站，运输建设材料及农具、种籽。辽东军区供给部已制订了生产需用资料的各项预算，现正筹购十台洋犁、四万余斤肥田粉和两万余斤稻种，以分发各生产部队进行春耕。
