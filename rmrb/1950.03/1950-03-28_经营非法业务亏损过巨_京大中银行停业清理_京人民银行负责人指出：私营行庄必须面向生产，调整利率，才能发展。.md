　　Excessive Losses Due to Illegal Business Operations
    Beijing Da Zhong Bank Ceases Operations for Liquidation
    Person in Charge of Beijing People's Bank Points Out: Private Banks and Native Banks Must Face Production, Adjust Interest Rates, to Develop.
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: Beijing's private Da Zhong Bank, due to mismanagement and excessive losses, and in order to safeguard legitimate social credit and protect the rights and interests of depositors, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has submitted a request to the competent authorities and been approved to order the bank to cease operations for liquidation starting yesterday (the 27th), within a specified period. All assets of the bank will be used to repay current debts. The bank has drafted measures for clearing various deposits and will publish an announcement in the newspaper soon.
    Da Zhong Bank was established in 1919, and its operating style has always been improper, which has not changed after liberation. In July 1949, the Shanghai Head Office of the bank was ordered to cease operations for liquidation by the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China due to improper business operations and the inability to make up for exchange losses. Since then, the bank's organization disintegrated, and the Beijing and Tianjin branches operated independently. The personnel and business of the Beijing branch were very chaotic, and its reputation was low. Due to the excessively high interest rates of the bank and native banks in the past, as of March 20, the bank was still able to absorb deposits of more than 2.5 billion yuan, but its loans were only more than 900 million yuan (including more than 200 million yuan in non-performing loans), accounting for only 36 percent of deposits. The bank bore a heavy burden of deposit interest, leading to increasing losses, which had reached more than 500 million yuan before the suspension of operations.
    The person in charge of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China made a statement on the bank's suspension of operations for liquidation, saying: In the past, private banks and native banks mostly colluded with bureaucrat capital to engage in illegal business activities in order to enrich themselves. After liberation, some banks and native banks have not completely improved this improper style. In addition to engaging in illegal business activities themselves, they also provided loans to industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in speculation. At present, prices are tending to stabilize, and these industrial and commercial enterprises have no opportunities for speculation, and their capital cannot be turned around, making it impossible for private banks and native banks to recover their loans when they are due, resulting in non-performing loans; at the same time, private banks and native banks have always maintained their business by absorbing deposits at high interest rates, so deposit interest has become a heavy burden for private banks and native banks, resulting in increasing losses. The suspension of operations for liquidation of Da Zhong Bank is an example. This time, the government ordered Da Zhong Bank to suspend operations for liquidation in order to safeguard legitimate social credit and protect the rights and interests of depositors, and it is also a relatively good thing for Da Zhong Bank itself. Otherwise, if it is allowed to drag on, the bank's losses will continue to increase, and it will be even more unable to bear the burden. Under the New Democratic economic policy, private banks and native banks must change their past style, face legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises, combine with production, and appropriately adjust interest rates in order to embark on a legitimate path of development.

　　经营非法业务亏损过巨
    京大中银行停业清理
    京人民银行负责人指出：私营行庄必须面向生产，调整利率，才能发展。
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市私营大中银行，因经营失当、亏损过巨、中国人民银行北京分行为保障社会正当信用，维护存款人权益起见，已呈奉主管机关核准，令其自昨（二十七）日起停业，限期清理。将以该行所有资产偿付目前债务。该行已拟定清付各项存款办法，即将登报公告。
    大中银行成立于一九一九年，经营作风一贯不正，解放后仍未改变。一九四九年七月该行上海总行因业务经营不当，交换亏额无法补足，经中国人民银行华东区行令其停业清理，自此该行组织解体，京津两行便分散经营，京行人事、业务均甚紊乱，信誉低下。由于过去行庄利率过高，截至三月二十日止，该行尚能吸收存款二十五亿余元，但其放款不过九亿余元（内尚有呆滞放款二亿余元），仅占存款百分之三十六，背负存款利息甚大，致亏累日深，停业前已达五亿余元。
    中国人民银行北京分行负责人曾就该行停业清理事发表谈话称：过去私营银行钱庄多半与官僚资本勾结，经营非法业务，以图自饱。解放后，有些行庄对这种不正当的作风仍未能彻底改善，它们除了自己经营非法业务外，就是放款给经营投机的工商业。目前物价趋于平稳，此等工商业因无机可投，资本无法周转，使得私营行庄的放款到期不能催收而形成呆滞；同时私营行庄本身一贯以高利吸收存款来维持业务，因而存款利息成了私营行庄沉重的负担，致亏损日甚。大中银行的停业清理就是个例子。这次政府令大中银行停业清理，是为了保障社会正当信用和维护存款人的权益，同时对大中银行本身说也是比较好的，否则任其拖延下去，该行亏累继续增加，将更无法负担。在新民主主义的经济政策下，私营行庄必须改变以往的作风，面向正当工商业，与生产结合，并适当地调整利率，才能走上正当的发展途径。
