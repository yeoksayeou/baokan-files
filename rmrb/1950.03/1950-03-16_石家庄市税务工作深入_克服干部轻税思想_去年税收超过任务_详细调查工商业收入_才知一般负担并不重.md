　　In-depth Tax Work in Shijiazhuang
    Overcomes Cadres' Underestimation of Taxation; Last Year's Tax Revenue Exceeded Target
    Detailed Investigation of Industrial and Commercial Income Reveals General Burden is Not Heavy
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Lu Chaoqi reports: The Shijiazhuang Municipal Taxation Bureau, based on actual materials, broke through cadres' underestimation of taxation, and last year's tax work exceeded the target. According to Shijiazhuang's situation after liberation, due to the abolition of the old tax law and the non-promulgation of the new tax law, taxes had not been levied on industrialists and businessmen for a long time. It was not until after the first Hebei Provincial Industrial and Commercial Conference in May of the year before last that it was decided to implement a unitary tax system—only levying income tax—starting in September, with very low tax rates. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin last year, in order to ensure war supplies and meet the needs of restoring and developing production, it was decided to first levy commodity tax, stamp tax, etc., in Shijiazhuang starting in April. The tax rates were similar to those during the Kuomintang period. As a result, not only were the industrialists and businessmen ideologically unconvinced, but many cadres (including tax cadres and cadres from other departments), even relatively responsible cadres, were also ideologically unconvinced. Some even mistakenly equated the people's government's tax policy with the Kuomintang's taxation. Although the leadership and the tax bureau repeatedly publicized and explained, they did not overcome this erroneous "benevolent government" thinking that underestimated taxation, which seriously affected the development of tax work.
    After the successive liberation of major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, the economic life of Shijiazhuang underwent great changes. Industrial and commercial enterprises that had prospered in the war environment through special business methods (such as speculation, etc.) gradually became depressed. Some transferred capital to Beijing and Tianjin, while others changed careers or closed down. Industrial and commercial enterprises that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood gradually developed with the support of the government. At this time, it coincided with the collection of industrial and commercial tax (the industrial and commercial tax collected in Shijiazhuang last year refers to income tax), stamp tax, and commodity tax. Industrialists and businessmen who closed down or changed careers attributed the reason for the depression to the government's tax policy; while industrialists and businessmen who did not close down or change careers, in order to evade the burden, also took this opportunity to shout that the burden was too heavy, confusing the public. Some cadres, due to insufficient understanding and without investigation and research, also echoed these claims; some were afraid of levying taxes, and some advocated levying less taxes. The idea of underestimating taxation thus arose, seriously affecting the progress of tax work. In order to clarify this kind of confused thinking and complete the tax revenue task, the Municipal Taxation Bureau conducted typical investigations. The results of the investigation proved that most of the depressed industrial and commercial households were old brands or large households, and their shareholders were mostly landlords. After the land reform, their lives depended entirely on the remaining industrial and commercial income to maintain, with many employees and large expenses, resulting in income not covering expenditure. Some were due to conservative business methods and internal disunity, with some shareholders wanting to operate independently, dividing the large into small, attempting to evade the burden; some were due to improper or untimely resolution of labor-capital disputes, as well as the commodities they operated not being suitable for the needs of the general public. In addition, the phenomenon of abnormally light or heavy burdens caused by mutual exclusion in the assessment of industrial and commercial taxes—“large squeezing small,” “small squeezing large,” “both ends squeezing the middle”—was not completely corrected. This was also a reason for making the burden appear heavy.
    In order to further educate cadres, the tax bureau also conducted similar investigations on some industrial and commercial households who, although they had not closed down or changed careers, were still clamoring that the burden was too heavy. According to the materials from 13 households in ten industries investigated, except for individual households that appeared to be burdened too heavily due to poor management, the general burden was reasonable. Calculated in kind, the highest burden accounted for 37% of the net profit, and the lowest only accounted for 2.6% of the net profit. The average burden accounted for a little over 22.2% of the average profit, which was lower than the original Hebei Provincial People's Government's stipulated tax rate of 25% of net profit. After this kind of investigation, the cadres recognized that the essence of industrialists and businessmen shouting that taxes were heavy was to evade the burden, initially correcting the erroneous idea of underestimating taxation and strengthening the tax revenue perspective. Therefore, Shijiazhuang's tax revenue task last year was victoriously completed, exceeding the originally assigned task by 26% (excluding liquor tax). In addition to supplying the city's financial expenditures, the annual tax revenue also remitted 9,236,809 jin of millet to the central government, fully achieving urban self-sufficiency.

　　石家庄市税务工作深入
    克服干部轻税思想  去年税收超过任务
    详细调查工商业收入  才知一般负担并不重
    【本报讯】记者陆超祺报道：石家庄市税务局掌握实际材料，打破干部轻税思想，去年税收工作超过任务完成。按石家庄市解放后由于旧税法废除，新税法又未公布，故很久没有向工商业家征税。至前年五月华北首届工商会议后，才决定自九月份起实行单一税制—仅征所得税—，税率亦很低。去年京、津解放后，为了保证战争供给，恢复与发展生产的需要，决定自四月份起首先在石家庄开征货物税、印花税等，其税率和国民党时期相差不多。因之，不但工商业家的思想搞不通，而且很多干部（包括税务干部及其他部门的干部在内）甚至是比较负责的干部的思想也搞不通。有的还错误地把人民政府的税收政策和国民党的税收混为一谈。虽经领导上及税局再三地宣传解释，也没有克服这种轻税的“仁政”的错误思想。致严重影响税收工作的开展。
    京津等各大城市相继解放后，石市经济生活起了很大变化，在战争环境下以特殊经营方式（如投机等）而繁荣起来的工商业渐渐地呈现萧条，有的把资本转到京津，有的转业或歇业了。而有利于国计民生的工商业，在政府的扶助下逐步地发展起来。这时候，恰值征收工商业税（按石家庄去年征收的工商业税即指所得税）、印花税和货物税等。歇业或转业的工商业家即把萧条原因归咎于政府的税收政策；而未歇业或转业的工商业家，为了逃避负担，亦借此机会叫喊负担过重，混淆视听。部分干部，由于认识不足，未经调查研究，亦随声附和；有的怕征税，有的主张少征税。轻税思想即由此产生，严重影响了税收工作的进行。市税局为澄清此种混乱思想，完成税收任务，进行了典型调查。经过调查结果证明：不景气之工商业户多系老字号或大户，其股东又多系地主，土改后生活全依靠剩下的工商业收入来维持，人手多，开支大，以致入不敷出。有的因经营方式保守，且闹不团结，有些股东想独自经营，大化小，企图逃避负担；有的因劳资纠纷解决不适当或不及时，以及经营的商品不适合人民大众需要等。此外，评议工商业税时互相排挤—“大挤小”、“小挤大”、“两头挤中间”而发生的畸轻畸重的现象未完全予以纠正。亦为显得负担重的原因。
    该税局为了更进一步教育干部，对一些虽未歇业或转业而叫嚷负担过重之工商业户，亦作同样调查。根据所调查的十个行业中十三户的材料证明：除个别户因经营不善而显得负担过重外，一般负担都是合理的。以实物计算，负担最高的占纯利的百分之三七，最低的只占纯利的百分之二·六，平均负担占平均利润的百分之二二·二强。比原华北人民政府的规定占纯利的百分之二十五的税率还低。经过这种调查后，才使干部认清了工商业家叫喊税重的本质是逃避负担，初步纠正了错误的轻税思想、加强了税收观点。因此，石家庄市去年的税收任务得以胜利完成，并超过原分配任务的百分之二十六。（酒税不计在内）。全年税款收入除供给全市的财政开支以外，还上解中央九、二三六、八○九斤小米，完全做到了城市自给。
