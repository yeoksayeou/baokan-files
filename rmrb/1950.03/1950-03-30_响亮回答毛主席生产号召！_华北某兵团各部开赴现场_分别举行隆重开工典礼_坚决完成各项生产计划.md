　　Responding Loudly to Chairman Mao's Production Call!
    A Certain Corps of the North China Military Region Marches to Work Sites
    Solemnly Holds Groundbreaking Ceremonies
    Resolutely Fulfill All Production Plans
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: Units of a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the North China Military Region held solemn groundbreaking ceremonies around the 20th of this month. Now, the troops have successively marched to the work sites, and a heated battle of production has already begun. At this moment, this reporter interviewed Commander Yang Chengwu of the corps, asking him to express his opinions on the corps' production preparation and experience. Commander Yang first stated: According to the Military Commission's instructions, our corps began actively preparing for production work in December of last year. Over the past three months, the preparations have been completed. The completion of this huge task fully demonstrates that the People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting force but also a large army of production labor. Commander Yang said with full confidence: As long as we do not suffer from irresistible natural disasters, we have a definite certainty of completing this year's production plans for our corps. Commander Yang used many vivid examples to illustrate the troops' high level of production enthusiasm: In a recent river-digging project of a certain unit, the original plan was for each person to dig two cubic meters per day, but the highest achieved was seven cubic meters per day, and the average was also five cubic meters, more than double the original plan. Commander Yang said: We will use the abundant results of production harvests to loudly respond to Chairman Mao's call to us.

    【本报讯】记者康伟中报道：人民解放军驻华北某兵团各部于本月二十日左右，分别举行隆重开工典礼。现各部队已陆续开赴现场，一场火热的生产战斗已经开始。就在这个时候，记者访问了该兵团杨成武司令员，请他对于该兵团的生产准备情况和经验发表意见。杨司令员首称：我兵团根据军委的指示，从去年十二月即开始积极进行生产准备工作。三个月来，准备工作已告完成。这项巨大工作的完成，充分地证明了人民解放军不仅是个战斗队，而且是一支生产劳动大军。杨司令员满怀信心地说：本兵团今年各项生产计划，只要不遭受不可抵御的天灾，是有确切把握完成的。杨司令员以许多生动事例说明部队高度的生产积极性：某部最近在挖河工程中，原计划每人每天挖两立方公尺，结果最高的每天挖到七立方公尺，平均也有五立方公尺，比原计划高出一倍还多。杨司令员说：我们将以生产收获的丰富的成果，响亮地回答毛主席给我们的号召。
