　　Dongyuan Village Honored as Autumn Grain Collection Model
    Lin Hong
    In last winter's autumn grain collection, Dongyuan Village in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, completed and exceeded its village's quota of over 90 *shi* of public grain in just two and a half days, and was rated as a first-class autumn grain collection model in the Chengguan District of Yanggao County. The county people's government issued a commendation order.
    Dongyuan Village is located along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, with a total of 189 households and more than 860 people. Last year, some of the village's land was flooded, resulting in only about 50% of the usual harvest. There were some difficulties for the masses to pay public grain. However, because the village underwent land reform last spring, the masses' awareness was raised. In March, the village branch was also established, giving the entire village a core of leadership. Therefore, the production work last year was carried out well, and it was twice rated as a production model village. The cadres are very active in their work, and the Party and the government enjoy extremely high prestige among the masses. Last winter, during the agricultural slack season, the village cadres saw that everyone was having difficulties in their lives and that public grain would soon have to be paid, so they actively led the masses in engaging in sideline production. Led by Party members, more than 160 able-bodied laborers in the village were mobilized and organized into twelve sideline production groups: some ran transport and sales, some collected manure and firewood, some went to Jining and other places to buy pig bristles, and some milled flour; the women did needlework such as making shoe soles. In one winter, the village earned a net profit of more than 120 *shi* of grain from these sideline productions alone; while the total public grain to be paid by the village was only over 90 *shi*. This laid the foundation for the village to pay public grain.
    The grain collection work in Yanggao County was arranged in early November last year. The provincial government stipulated that it should all be completed by the end of the month. Before the county's meeting to arrange the autumn grain collection was over, Dongyuan Village and Nanyuan Village challenged each other to a competition to pay public grain. Wen Mao, the village head, took advantage of his spare time at night to rush back to the village and ask Wu Jun, the village Party secretary, to immediately arrange the autumn grain collection. On the same night that he received the news, the village Party secretary immediately convened a branch meeting, which was unanimously supported by all Party members. Party member Wu Xiankui proposed that, in order to ensure the victory of the competition, a competition should be launched between *lü* (a traditional village subdivision), which was enthusiastically supported by everyone. It was decided that each *lü* would automatically select two representatives to be responsible for supervising and inspecting to ensure the quality of the public grain. After the branch meeting, Party members went to each household to carry out propaganda and mobilization. The next day, the village held a representative meeting and a mass meeting, and the burden of each household was determined based on the past assessment of output. In the evening, the entire village's masses, representatives, and cadres were divided into two groups to hold a discussion on reducing the burden on disaster-stricken households. At the meeting, the village cadres first proposed how much each household should be reduced, and then everyone discussed it. With this method of face-to-face debate between cadres and the masses, cadres could not be partial to disaster-stricken households. Because the masses knew each other's situation best, it was also fairer and more reasonable. For example, at the discussion, a woman from an unindustrious family said: "My family should be reduced, my father is sick, and the land is not good." Immediately, a woman named Xu Zhenghua said: "Your family cannot be reduced. Your father's illness is 'flour disease' (opium addiction); the land is not bad, it's just that your family didn't cultivate it well." This was supported by everyone. After the two groups' meetings were over, the decisions of the two groups were compared, and the difference between the two groups' decisions on the total amount of reduction and exemption for the village was only one *dou* of grain. This shows that the eyes of the masses are truly discerning.
    The meeting to reduce the burden on disaster-stricken households lasted all night. The next morning, grain was delivered to the village office one after another. Cadres and Party members took the lead, paying early, and the grain was of good quality, and rarely returned. As old farmer Lu Yu said: "I worked as a long-term laborer for forty years and only earned half a *mu* of land. After the Communist Party came, they allocated four *mu* of land to me. Paying a little public grain is still an inexhaustible expression of gratitude." The farmers call public grain "patriotic grain," which truly shows how much they love the people's motherland. The people of Dongyuan Village believe that paying public grain is an act of patriotism, which is an important reason for being honored as an autumn grain collection model.

　　荣膺秋征模范的东园村
    林洪
    察哈尔省阳高县东园村在去冬秋征中，仅两天半的时间就全部完成并超过了全村九十多石公粮的征收任务，被评为阳高县城关区的一等秋征模范。县人民政府曾明令表扬。
    东园村位于京绥路沿线，共有一百八十九户，八百六十多人。去年该村有一部分土地曾被水淹，只有五成左右的年景。群众要缴纳公粮是有若干困难的。但因去年春天，该村经过土地改革，群众的觉悟提高。三月间，村支部也成立了，全村有了领导的核心。因此，去年的生产工作搞得不错，曾经两次被评为生产模范村。干部工作很积极，党和政府在群众中威信极高。去冬农闲时，村干部看见大家的生活有困难，不久又要缴公粮，于是就积极领导群众进行副业生产，由党员带头，全村发动了一百六十多个全劳动力，组织起十二个副业生产小组：有的跑运销，有的拾粪、拾柴，有的到集宁等地收买猪鬃，有的磨粉；妇女们则作纳鞋底等针线活。全村一个冬天单靠这些副业生产，就净赚了一百二十多石粮食；而全村要缴的公粮还不过九十多石。这就给该村缴纳公粮打下了基础。
    阳高县的征收工作，是在去年十一月初旬布置的。省府规定月底全部完成。县里布置秋征的会议还未结束，东园村和南园村就互相挑战竞赛缴纳公粮。该村村长温茂利用晚上空隙时间，先跑回村，要村支书伍俊立刻布置秋征。村支书在得到消息的当天晚上，就立刻召开了支部大会，得到全体党员的一致拥护。党员伍先魁提出，为了保证竞赛的胜利，应发动闾与闾间的竞赛，得到了大家的热烈响应，决定每闾自动选出两个代表，负责督促检查，以保证公粮的质量。支部会结束后，党员们分头到各户作宣传动员。第二天全村就召开代表会和群众大会，按照过去评定产量的基础，把每一户的负担量决定了。晚上又把全村群众、代表和干部分成两片，召开减少受灾户负担的讨论会。在会上，先由村干部提出那一户应减多少，然后经过大家评议。用这种干部群众面对面争论的办法，干部对受灾户不能偏袒。因为各家情况，群众彼此知道得最清楚，所以也较公平合理。如在讨论会上有一个不勤劳家庭的妇女说：“我家应该减，我父亲有病，地也不好。”马上有一个叫徐正花的妇女说：“你家不能减。你父亲的病是料面病（吸大烟）；地不是不好，是你家没好好种。”得到大家的赞成。两片的会开完后，再在一起把两片的决定对照一下，结果两片的决定中，全村应减免的数字只相差一斗粮食。这说明群众的眼睛真是雪亮的。
    减少受灾户负担的会整整开了一晚上。第三天早晨，粮食就纷纷送到村公所。干部党员争先带头，缴的早，粮食又好，很少有被打回的。如老农民鲁玉说：“我当了四十年长工，只赚下半亩地。共产党来了，就分给我四亩地。缴点公粮也还是感恩不尽。”农民们都叫公粮是爱国粮，正说明他们对人民祖国是如何的热爱。东园村人民认为交公粮是爱国行动，是荣膺秋征模范的一个重要原因。
