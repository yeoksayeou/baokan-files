　　How U.S. Imperialism Invades Latin America?

　　The meeting of U.S. diplomatic personnel stationed in South American countries in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, from the 7th to the 9th of this month, like the Havana meeting of U.S. diplomatic personnel stationed in Central American countries in January of this year, is a new action by U.S. imperialism to further enslave the people of Latin America, attempting to rapidly turn Latin America into a colony and a rear base for launching a new war.

　　Geographically, Latin America includes all of Central and South America south of the United States. Because the people who live there are mostly descendants of the Latin nations of Spain and Portugal, it is called Latin America. There, in addition to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, British Honduras, and the British, French, and Dutch Guianas, there are nominally twenty independent countries. The total area is 21 million square kilometers, more than twice the size of China, and the population is estimated to be about 148 million in 1949.

　　Latin America has always been a battleground for imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan. World War I created an excellent opportunity for the large-scale intrusion of American forces into Latin America. After World War II, due to the withdrawal of German and Japanese fascists from the international market and the great weakening of Britain in the war, American forces almost monopolized Latin America. Currently, U.S. monopoly capitalists control almost all of Latin America's iron sand production, more than nine-tenths of its copper, seven-tenths of its silver, two-thirds of its zinc, more than half of its oil, and almost all of its manganese and platinum production.

　　U.S. monopoly capitalists not only directly control the industries and resources of Latin America, but also make their economies develop abnormally to serve the U.S. economy solely. For example, Uruguay raises cattle for the United States, Venezuela produces oil for the United States, Brazil produces coffee for the United States, Bolivia supplies lead to the United States, Chile transports copper and saltpeter to the United States, Cuba makes sugar for the United States, and the countries along the Caribbean Sea become large plantations for the United States. The aim of U.S. monopoly capitalists is to completely turn Latin America into a source of raw materials for the United States, relying solely on exporting its single products to the United States to maintain its national economy. At the same time, U.S. monopoly capitalists strangle Latin America's national industries through massive dumping. U.S. exports to Latin American countries increased from an average annual export total of 484 million US dollars before the war (1936-1938) to 3.858 billion US dollars in 1947, 3.158 billion US dollars in 1948, and 1.468 billion US dollars in the first half of last year, meaning the average in the three years after the war had increased more than six times compared to before the war.

　　Since the end of the war, U.S. imperialism has systematically taken various measures to interfere with and undermine the sovereignty of Latin American countries. Militarily, as early as May 1946, Truman submitted a message to Congress requesting the passage of a bill to standardize the military equipment of Pan-American countries and implement so-called "Pan-American military cooperation." In August 1947, the United States, based on this aggressive intention, convened the Rio de Janeiro Conference and adopted the so-called "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance," which stipulated that any signatory country should immediately provide "assistance" if any place in the "security zone" stipulated in the treaty was attacked. In March 1948, the Bogotá Conference also passed the establishment of the Organization of American States and its leading body, the Council of the Organization of American States, with its headquarters in Washington. The United States used this organization to control the national defense of Latin American countries. Among the United States' more than 400 overseas strategic bases, 75 are in Latin America. Politically, U.S. aggressors frequently create conspiracies and military coups to overthrow governments that are not entirely suitable for the interests of U.S. monopoly capitalists, and support puppet groups that can best serve them. After the war, political disturbances manipulated behind the scenes by U.S. aggressors occurred continuously in Latin American countries such as Bolivia, Paraguay, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela. Not only that, but U.S. reactionaries also used the reactionary AFL and CIO right-wing groups to carry out activities to split the Latin American workers' movement and undermine their unity. The so-called "Lima Labor Conference" directed by the AFL in 1948 was the most obvious example of this kind of splitting activity. The activities of the U.S. police and intelligence organization, the FBI, have also extended to Latin America, serving as organizers and instructors of political espionage.

　　In the past few years since the war, the movements of the Latin American people to strive for democracy and national independence have greatly developed. The communist parties of various Latin American countries, which lead this movement, have now developed to have about 500,000 members. The Latin American Confederation of Labor, the real international working-class organization in Latin America, has 6.5 million members. They are actively uniting all progressive forces, organizing a broad united front, and fighting against U.S. imperialism and the reactionary dictatorial regimes it supports. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　美帝怎样侵略拉丁美洲？
    本月七日至九日，美驻南美国家外交人员在巴西首都里约热内卢举行会议，这和今年一月美驻中美各国外交人员举行的哈瓦那会议一样，都是美国帝国主义进一步奴役拉丁美洲人民的新行动，企图把拉丁美洲迅速沦为殖民地，和作为发动新战争的后方。
    在地理上，拉丁美洲包括美国以南的全部中南美洲。因为居住在那里的人民，多半是西班牙、葡萄牙这些拉丁民族的后裔，所以称为拉丁美洲。在那里，除美属波多黎各、英属洪都拉斯，英、法、荷分属的圭亚那外，名义上有二十个独立国家。总面积达两千一百万平方公里，比我国大一倍多，人口据一九四九年估计，约一亿四千八百万。
    拉丁美洲一向是英、美、德、日等帝国主义国家的角逐场。第一次世界大战造成了美国势力大举侵入拉丁美洲的绝好机会。第二次世界大战后，由于德、日法西斯退出了国际市场，由于英国在战争中已大大削弱，美国势力几乎独占了拉丁美洲。目前美国垄断资本家控制了拉丁美洲差不多全部的铁砂生产，十分之九以上的铜，十分之七的银，三分之二的锌，一半以上的石油和几乎全部的锰、铂生产。
    美国垄断资本家不仅直接控制了拉丁美洲的工业和资源，并且使它们的经济畸形地发展成为单纯地为美国的经济服务。例如：使乌拉圭跟美国养牛，委内瑞拉为美国生产石油，巴西给美国出产咖啡，玻利维亚为美国供给铅，智利向美国输送铜和硝石，古巴替美国制糖，沿加勒比海诸国成为美国的大种植场。美国垄断资本家的企图，就是要使得拉丁美洲完全变成美国的原料取给地，只能依靠向美国输出其单一产品，以维持其国民经济。与此同时，美国垄断资本家以大量的倾销来扼杀拉丁美洲的民族工业。美国对拉丁美洲国家的输出，从战前一九三六——三八年每年平均输出总额的四亿八千四百万美元，增至一九四七年的三十八亿五千八百万美元，四八年的三十一亿五千八百万美元，和去年上半年的十四亿六千八百万美元，即战后三年平均已较战前增加了六倍以上。
    美国帝国主义在战争结束后即有步骤地采取种种干涉和破坏拉丁美洲国家主权的措施。在军事上，早在一九四六年五月，杜鲁门就向国会提出咨文，要求通过议案，将泛美国家的军备加以标准化，实行所谓“泛美军事合作”。而在一九四七年八月美国即依据这种侵略意图，召开了里约热内卢会议，通过了所谓“西半球联防公约”、其中规定在公约所规定的“安全区”中任何一处遭受攻击，签字国应立即加以“援助”。一九四八年三月，波哥大会议又通过成立泛美组织及其领导机构泛美理事会，会址设于华盛顿。美国利用这个机构，控制了拉丁美洲各国的国防。在美国四百余个国外战略基地中，拉丁美洲即有七十五个。在政治上，美国侵略分子经常制造着阴谋与军事政变，推翻不完全适合于美国垄断资本家利益的政府，扶植最能为他们效劳的傀儡集团。战后，拉丁美洲国家如玻利维亚、巴拉圭、巴拿马、哥仑比亚与委内瑞拉，都曾连续发生了由美国侵略分子在幕后操纵的政治性的骚乱。不仅如此，美国反动派还利用反动的劳联和产联右翼集团，展开活动，以期分裂拉丁美洲的工人运动，破坏他们的团结。一九四八年由劳联导演的所谓“利马劳工会议”，就是这种分裂活动的最明显的一个例子。美国的警察特务组织，联邦调查局的特务活动，也伸展到拉丁美洲，担任着政治侦探的组织者和教官的角色。
    拉丁美洲人民争取民主和民族独立的运动，战后数年来，有了很大的发展。领导这一运动的拉丁美洲各国共产党，现已发展到有五十万左右的党员，拉丁美洲真正的国际工人阶级组织——拉丁美洲劳工联合会，拥有六百五十万会员。他们正积极团结一切进步力量，组织广泛的统一战线，与美国帝国主义及其所扶植的反动独裁政权作斗争。  （新华社）
