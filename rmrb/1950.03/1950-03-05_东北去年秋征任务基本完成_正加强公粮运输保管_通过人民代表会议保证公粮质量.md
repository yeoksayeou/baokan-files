Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: The 1949 public grain procurement work in Northeast China has been basically completed, and transportation and storage are now being strengthened. Various provinces and cities successively deployed grain procurement tasks in October last year, and began warehousing in mid-November. As of the beginning of last month, except for Liaodong Province, where 5 percent remains to be collected, and the Lushun-Dalian area, where 2 percent remains to be collected, the four provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoxi, and Rehe, and the four cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi, have all completed the warehousing task.

Encouraged by the victorious situation of the national liberation, farmers in various regions voluntarily delivered more public grain. As a result, 70 counties and cities in the Northeast exceeded the prescribed task of grain delivery. According to statistics from 32 counties in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Songjiang provinces alone, more than 103,000 tons of public grain were delivered in excess. The high enthusiasm of farmers in paying public grain is also due to the thorough implementation of fair and reasonable burden policies. In order to better adjust the burden, various regions have earnestly paid attention to grasping the average annual yield and grade of land. Many regions have also specifically investigated land area, grade, and disaster conditions, uncovering a large number of "black lands" (undeclared or under-reported land), adjusting excessively low land grades, and appropriately taking care of disaster situations, so that the burden on farmers in the entire region has been relatively reduced to only about 18 percent of the normal annual yield. Disaster-stricken areas, based on accurate investigation and evaluation of disaster conditions, correctly implemented the reduction and exemption policies in the Northeast People's Government's grain procurement regulations. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province, approximately one million mu of disaster areas with less than 20 percent harvest received full exemption; approximately six million mu of areas with 20 to 60 percent harvest received a reduction of one-half to one-quarter. Songjiang Province also stipulated that land yielding less than 80 jin per mu would be subject to reduced levy; land yielding less than 50 jin per mu would be exempt.

Before the procurement, various regions universally discussed the issue of ensuring the quality of public grain through people's representative conferences, coupled with the leading role of rural Communist Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres, mobilizing the vast number of farmers to carry out manual selection and launching a movement to deliver high-quality grain. As a result, most of the public grain met high-quality standards. In Liaodong Province, the proportion of public grain that met high-quality standards accounted for more than 80 percent of the province's total public grain. In Heilongjiang Province, first-class grain (purity above 98 percent) accounted for 53 percent, second-class grain (purity above 94 percent) accounted for 44 percent, and grain below third-class accounted for only 3 percent. The average purity of all public grain in Songjiang Province also reached above 94 degrees. Rehe and Liaoxi provinces, which were more severely affected by disasters, also ensured that more than 80 percent was first-class and second-class grain.

At present, grain stations and granaries in various regions, in addition to making every effort to rush transportation, are strengthening storage work such as preventing rot, fire, and theft. In Heilongjiang Province, in addition to transporting three-quarters of the total public grain for export, it is actively carrying out screening and warehousing of the remaining one-quarter of the long-term storage grain, and establishing a regular inspection system to avoid various losses. The Rehe Province Grain Bureau has dispatched 80 cadres to 56 granaries throughout the province to help each granary investigate grain types, evaluate quality grades, and establish a storage management committee to determine a dedicated responsibility system to strengthen the security of granaries. Jilin Province's granaries are strengthening grain testing work based on past experience to facilitate storage. According to the Northeast Grain Depot General Bureau, it is estimated that the vast majority of grain in the Northeast can be sealed before the thaw.

　　东北去年秋征任务基本完成
    正加强公粮运输保管   
    通过人民代表会议保证公粮质量
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北各地一九四九年度公粮征收工作已基本完成，现正加强运输与保管中。各省市于去年十月先后布置征粮任务，十一月中旬开始入仓，截至上月初旬止，除辽东省尚有百分之五及旅大地区尚有百分之二正加紧征收外，其他黑龙江、吉林、辽西、热河四省及沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪四市，都已全部完成入仓任务。
    各地农民在全国解放胜利形势鼓舞下，纷纷自愿多交公粮，因而全东北有七十个县、市交粮超过规定任务；仅据黑龙江、吉林、松江三省中三十二个县统计，即多交公粮十万三千余吨。农民交纳公粮热情的高涨，还由于公平合理的负担政策的贯彻执行。各地为了更好地调整负担，均切实注意到掌握土地常年平均产量和等级，不少地区又特别调查了土地面积、等级和灾情等工作，查出了大批黑地，并调整了过低的土地等级，也适当地照顾了灾情，使全区农民负担相对地减轻至仅占常年产量百分之十八左右。受灾地区根据对灾情的确实调查和评议，正确执行了东北人民政府征粮条例中的减免政策。据黑龙江省统计，全省约一百万亩二成以下收成的灾区获得全部免征；约六百万亩二至六成收成的地区减征二分之一至四分之一。松江省亦规定每亩收粮八十斤以下者减征；五十斤以下者免征。
    各地在征收前普遍通过人民代表会议，讨论了保证公粮的质量问题，加以农村共产党员、青年团员及村屯干部带头，动员广大农民进行人工挑选，展开交上等粮运动，因而大部分公粮都合乎上等规格。辽东省合乎上等粮标准的占该省全部公粮的百分之八十以上。黑龙江省一等粮（纯度九十八以上）占百分之五十三，二等粮（纯度百分之九十四以上）占百分之四十四，三等以下的粮食仅占百分之三。松江省全部公粮质量纯度平均亦达九十四度以上。受灾较重的热河、辽西两省，亦都保证百分之八十以上为头等和二等粮。
    目前各地粮栈粮库，除全力突击运输外，正加强防烂、防火、防盗等保管工作。黑龙江省现在除将全部公粮的四分之三出口粮进行调运外，对所留四分之一的长期保管粮食，正积极进行过筛入仓，并建立定期检查制度，避免各种损失。热河省粮食局已派出八十名干部分赴全省五十六个粮库，帮助各库房调查粮食种类、评定质量等级；并建立保管委员会，确定专责制，以加强保卫粮库安全。吉林省粮库根据过去经验正加强粮食化验工作，以便保管。据东北粮库总局估计，全东北绝大部分的粮食可争取于解冻前完成封仓。
