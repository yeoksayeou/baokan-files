　　Capital Auto Repair Factory
    Implements Bonus System for Exceeding Quotas, Significantly Improving Repair Speed
    [Beijing News] Since December of last year, the Beijing Auto Repair Factory has been piloting a bonus system for exceeding quotas. The repair shops under the factory have already achieved initial results and gained experience. Since the implementation of democratic management in November of last year, the factory has seen a significant increase in labor productivity. To consolidate workers' production enthusiasm, the administration and trade union, after extensive review and research, drafted a bonus plan. This plan was discussed and approved by the Management Committee and then passed by all workers in the factory for implementation. The repair shop immediately formed a car repair scoring committee composed of the shop director, technicians, and production officers. Based on the amount of labor required for various tasks and the condition of the vehicles, they established standard repair quotas. For example, a major overhaul of a Jiefang CA-10 engine was worth 32 points, while other vehicle engines were worth 30 or 28 points. In addition, the fitting of parts on the vehicle body was also assigned a specific point value. The bonus system was designed according to different divisions of labor, with three types of bonuses: collective quantity bonus, individual quantity bonus, and collective bonus for auxiliary work. The administration would extract a certain amount from the workers' excess production achievements as a bonus, and bonuses were awarded on a progressive scale based on the amount exceeding the quota. In December, after discussion by all workers in the shop, the standard quota was set at 45 points. After a few days of implementation, it was revised to 35 points due to the standard being too high. In the two months since the repair shop implemented the pilot program, great achievements have been made, and the speed of repair has increased significantly. In December, all workers in the shop used 10,359 work hours to complete 1,111 points of work. In January, they used 9,489 work hours to complete 1,555 points of work. In January, five out of the twelve work groups in the shop exceeded their quotas, and eighteen out of fifty people received bonuses. The highest record was the second group, with an average excess of 4.617 points per person. Since the implementation of the bonus system for exceeding quotas, workers' production enthusiasm has significantly increased. In addition to actively researching and improving technology, they have also spontaneously suggested reforms to various technologies and equipment, thereby laying the foundation for developing rationalization proposals. The majority of workers have also formulated group and individual plans. However, among individual workers, there is still an incorrect attitude of striving for bonuses for the sake of bonuses. The administration should also help workers solve problems with work methods and strictly implement the inspection system to better improve work and complete production tasks.

　　首都汽车修配厂
    试行超额奖金制度  修车速度显著提高
    【北京讯】北京汽车修配厂，自去年十二月份试行超额奖金制以来，该厂所属修理场已收到初步成绩和经验。该厂自去年十一月间，实行民主管理后，劳动生产率大增，行政、工会为巩固工人生产情绪，经过多方面审查与研究，拟出奖金办法，经过管委会讨论决议，并交全厂工人讨论通过执行。修理场当即由场长、技术员、生产干事等组成修车评分委员会，根据各种工作所需的劳动量和车的成色新旧，订出修车标准定额。例如：大修一辆吉士一五○车引擎是三十二分，其他各种车引擎有三十分或二十八分的。另外车体上配装机件，也都定出一定分数。给奖办法是根据分工情形的不同，分集体数量奖，个人数量奖，辅助工作集体奖三种。行政上从工人超额的生产成果中抽出一定数目作为奖金，按超过定额数目实行累进给奖。十二月份经全场工人研究，标准定额订为四十五分，实行数日后，因标准过高又讨论改为三十五分。修理场试行两个月以来，收到很大成绩，修车速度有显著提高，十二月份，全场工人用去一万零三百五十九个工时，完成工作一千一百一十一分；一月份用九千四百八十九工时，完成工作一千五百五十五分。一月份全场十二个工作组，有五个组超额，五十人当中有十八人得奖，最高纪录为第二组，每人平均超额四点六一七分。试行超额奖金制实行后，工人生产情绪显著提高，除积极研究改进技术外，更自动建议改革各种技术、设备，从而打下开展合理化建议的基础。大多数工人并制订了小组和个人的计划。但是在个别工人当中，目前还存在着为得奖而得奖的不正确态度，行政上也应该帮助工人解决工作方法问题，并严格执行检查制度，更好地改进工作，完成生产任务。
