　　US Diplomatic Personnel Gather
    To Deploy New Aggression Activities Against Europe
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] Following the US diplomatic personnel conferences held in Bangkok in mid-February and in Rio de Janeiro and Cairo earlier this month, a conference of US envoys and consuls from major European countries was held in Rome on the 22nd of this month to discuss and deploy new US aggression activities against Europe. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Rome on the 23rd, in addition to the US ambassadors to France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, the conference was attended by US Marshall Plan Ambassador to Europe, Harriman, and US High Commissioner for West Germany, McCloy. US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, Perkins, also rushed to attend. According to Agence France-Presse, the conference will discuss the specific implementation in Europe of the so-called "total diplomacy" recently touted by Acheson, and will involve the so-called "Franco-German alliance," the French people's anti-war and anti-"military aid" movements, the Italian economic crisis and strike wave, the unstable political situation in the United Kingdom after the general election, and "all issues in these countries that are of particular concern to the United States." Prior to the Rome conference, US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Allen, made a "short visit" to Athens. According to a TASS dispatch on the 23rd, citing a report in the Italian Communist Party's newspaper, Unità, Allen's trip was related to including Yugoslavia in the planned Italo-Turkish-Greek "Mediterranean Pact," which is part of the American aggressive bloc.
