Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th: Hebei and Shandong provinces have achieved remarkable results in tree planting and afforestation work last year, which has greatly helped in preventing floods and increasing farmers' sideline income. Hebei Province planted more than 51.25 million trees in the past year; Shandong Province's public forestry was also gradually restored last year. In order to better carry out tree planting and afforestation work, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has also formulated a plan for tree planting and afforestation in the province for 1950. In addition, the Wanbei Administrative Office has also decided to systematically close hillsides for afforestation and focus on afforestation in the region this year.

Last year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government established a forestry bureau and six afforestation farms throughout the province, and dispatched cadres to conduct tree planting propaganda and technical guidance. For example, last spring, the Ji'zhong Administrative Office organized a tree planting work team of more than 50 people to go to six key afforestation areas and villages to promote afforestation work; Lai'shui County also had 43 county-level cadres going to the countryside to mobilize the masses to cooperate in afforestation, formulating profit-sharing methods, and helping the masses solve the difficulties of lacking land, manpower and tree seedlings. Most villages in the province have organized forest protection committees to protect trees. In February this year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a forestry conference and formulated a plan for planting 50 million trees, sowing seeds for afforestation on 50,000 mu of barren hills, and developing nurseries from 3,510 mu to 6,550 mu in the province this year.

The forests in Shandong Province suffered severe damage from the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, and almost more than half of the forests in the province were lost. Last year, after the entire territory of Shandong was liberated, the Provincial People's Government actively carried out forestry restoration and construction work, first preliminarily establishing forestry agencies in governments at all levels in the province, taking over and reorganizing the old forest farms. After reorganization, there were 38 large-scale public forest farms and 104 nurseries in the province, and forestry training classes were also established to train a large number of forestry technical cadres. The Provincial People's Government also determined the policy of protecting forests before afforestation, and promulgated measures for protecting and rewarding trees, and in specific implementation, it also grasped the principle of starting with closing hillsides, while not abandoning conditional afforestation. Therefore, the province has basically eliminated the phenomenon of forest destruction last year, and has laid a preliminary foundation for the work of closing hillsides. In terms of afforestation and seedling cultivation, the province has afforested more than 60,700 mu, planted more than 8.24 million trees (there are now more than 12 million trees in the province, only about 2 million less than in 1940), sown 2.855 million holes, and cultivated more than 28.58 million seedlings in the past year.

The Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Wanbei People's Administrative Office has decided to systematically close hillsides for afforestation and focus on afforestation in the region this year. In terms of closing hillsides for afforestation, it is planned to close 41,500 mu in Zhufuo'an, Dushan, Maotanchang in the Dabie Mountain forest area and Shimenshan, Langya Mountain, and Zipeng Mountain in the Huainan forest area, strictly prohibiting indiscriminate logging and setting fires on mountains. In terms of key afforestation, the Administrative Office has decided to use the existing seedlings from various farms to plant 2.2 million trees, and has decided to carry out mass tree planting campaigns. In order to complete this plan, the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Administrative Office has established a Forestry and Reclamation Section, specializing in the investigation, design and research of forestry and reclamation in the region. In addition, three forest farms have been established in Maotanchang, Shimenshan, and Zipeng Mountain to engage in seedling cultivation, afforestation, forest protection, research and promotion.

　　河北去年植树五千万株  山东公营林业逐步恢复
    皖北行署制定计划封山造林
    【新华社北京十一日电】河北、山东两省去年的植树造林工作已获得显著成绩，这对于预防水患和增加农民副业收入有很大帮助。河北全省去年一年内共植树五千一百二十五万余株；山东省的公营林业去年也在逐步地恢复。为了更好地开展植树造林工作，河北省人民政府并订出了一九五○年全省植树造林计划。此外，皖北行署也决定今年在全区有计划地进行封山养林和重点造林。
    河北省人民政府去年曾在全省设立了造林局和造林场六处，并派遣干部进行植树的宣传和技术指导工作。如去春冀中行署组织了五十余人的造林工作队，分赴六个造林重点区、村推动造林工作；涞水县也有县级干部四十三人下乡发动群众合作造林，制定分红办法，帮助群众解决了缺乏土地、人力和树秧的困难。省内大部村庄里都组织了护林委员会以保护林木。今年二月，河北省人民政府召开了林业会议，订出今年全省植树五千万株、荒山播种造林五万亩、发展苗圃三千五百一十亩到六千五百五十亩的计划。
    山东省的林木在抗日战争和解放战争期间遭受日寇和蒋匪的严重破坏，全省几乎有一半以上的林木受了损失。去年山东全境解放后，该省人民政府即积极开展林业恢复建设工作，首先在省内各级政府中初步建立了林业机构，接管和整理旧有的林场，经整理后全省共有较大公营林场三十八处，苗圃一○四处，又开办林业训练班等大量培养林业技术干部；该省人民政府并确定造林必先护林的方针，颁布了保护与奖励林木办法，在具体执行时又掌握了从封山着手，同时不放弃有条件的造林的原则。因此，去年全省已基本上杜绝了林木的破坏现象，并使封山工作打下了初步的基础。在造林育苗方面，全省一年来共造林六万零七百余亩，植树八百二十四万余株（现全省共有一千二百余万株，较一九四○年仅差二百余万株），播种二百八十五万五千穴，育苗二千八百五十八万余株。
    皖北人民行署农林处决定今年在全区有计划地进行封山养林和重点造林。在封山养林方面，计划在大别山林区的诸佛庵、独山、毛坦厂和淮南林区的石门山、琅琊山、紫蓬山等处封山四万一千五百亩，严禁滥伐树木和放火烧山。在重点造林方面，行署决定利用现有各农场的树苗植树二百二十万株，并决定开展群众性的植树运动。为完成这一计划，行署农林处已成立林垦科，专司全区林垦的调查、设计和研究工作，此外并在毛坦厂、石门山、紫蓬山设立三个林场，从事育苗、造林、护林、研究和推广等工作。
