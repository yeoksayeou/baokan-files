Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Under the auspices of US imperialism, the United States, Britain, and the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang are training a large number of secret agents in Taiwan, Japan, and other places, attempting to infiltrate the Chinese mainland from Hong Kong and engage in sabotage activities. According to a Saigon dispatch from the Electric News Agency on the 17th, an official from MacArthur's headquarters who came from Tokyo to Saigon to inspect French colonial troops secretly revealed that a spy headquarters in Hong Kong, directly controlled by MacArthur's headquarters, is planning, coordinating, and supervising US and British espionage activities in Chinese territory; opening spy schools in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan; and maintaining close ties with illegal organizations, Catholic priests and their organizations from the Kuomintang reactionary remnants operating in China. The US military authorities bear the costs of spy schools in the US-occupied areas of the Far East. The schools are managed by American experts. The students are mainly recruited from former officials of Chiang Kai-shek and from the intelligence organizations of the former Japanese army. The curriculum includes training in the use of weapons and explosives. The task of the secret agents after graduation is to infiltrate the political organizations, government agencies, and people of the People's Republic of China, engage in espionage activities, and undermine public sentiment, especially in newly liberated areas. After graduating from spy school, the secret agents enter Chinese territory and establish contact with former senior Kuomintang officials, military officers, and heads of various reactionary political parties, and establish illegal organizations with their help. The secret agents then supply these organizations with money and weapons. MacArthur recently ordered the release of a group of Japanese war criminals considered "experts" on the China issue from prison, using them to oppose the people's China. US and British espionage agencies also engage in espionage activities through European and American Catholic missionary groups and commercial companies. US and British espionage agencies in China receive significant assistance from European and American Catholic missionary groups. The Hong Kong spy headquarters uses American and Canadian foreign missionary groups as peripheral organizations, providing "reliable" missionaries in China with detailed intelligence and instructions on how to engage in activities against the Chinese People's regime. The missionary societies were instructed "under no circumstances" to leave China, and if necessary, to illegally establish various religious and charitable organizations among their wealthy parishioners (businessmen and landlords) and the Kuomintang reactionary remnants. Another link in the US-British spy chain is the US-British industrial and commercial enterprises. The spy headquarters presided over by US imperialism has established such "commercial" companies in Hong Kong, called "Hong Kong Nanyang Foreign Trade Company." Many British industrial and commercial agencies still working in mainland China have recently replaced their business managers with direct agents of the Hong Kong spy headquarters, or sent them "trade" and "industrial" experts. Their activities include compiling intelligence on China's economy, national construction, and the production capacity of state-owned industries.

　　美英勾结蒋匪训练大批特务
    妄图利用教会商业组织  潜入我国大陆进行破坏
    警惕帝国主义间谍活动！
    【新华社二十日讯】在美帝国主义主持下，美国、英国和国民党残余匪帮正在台湾、日本等地训练大批特务，企图由香港潜入中国大陆，从事破坏活动。据电通社西贡十七日消息称：由东京前来西贡检阅法国殖民军队的麦克阿瑟总部官员暗中透露：直接由麦克阿瑟总部控制的刻在香港的间谍总部，正从事计划、调度和监督中国领土上的美、英间谍活动；在日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾和台湾开办间谍学校；并和在中国活动的国民党反动残余的非法组织、天主教士及他们的组织保持密切的联系。美国军事当局负担远东美占区间谍学校的费用。学校由美国专家管理。学生主要是由蒋介石以前的官吏中及前日本军队的特务组织中召募的。课程包括武器及炸药使用的训练。特务们毕业后的任务就是打入中华人民共和国的政治组织、政府机构及人民中，从事间谍活动，破坏公众情绪，特别是在新解放的地区。特务们从间谍学校毕业之后，就进入中国领土，与以前的国民党高级官员们、军官们和各反动政治党派的负责人们建立联系，并在他们帮助下，建立非法组织。特务们则以金钱和武器供给这些组织。麦克阿瑟最近已下令从狱中释放一批被认为是中国问题“专家”的日本战犯，利用来反对人民的中国。美、英在华间谍机关并通过欧美天主教传教团体和商业公司从事特务活动。美、英在华的间谍机关受到欧美天主教传教团体的重大援助。香港的间谍总部利用美国和加拿大各国外传教团体作为外围组织，供给在中国的“可靠的”传教士以详细情报及如何从事反对中国人民政权的活动的指示。各传教会被指示“在任何情形下”都不可离开中国，必要时并在它们的有钱的教徒（商人与地主）中和国民党反动残余分子中非法地建立各种宗教团体和慈善团体。在美英间谍链锁中的另一环节，是美英的工商企业。美帝国主义主持的间谍总部，已在香港创设这种“商业”公司，名为“香港南洋国外贸易公司”。许多仍在中国大陆工作的英国工商业代办机构，最近把他们的营业经理撤换掉，代以香港间谍总部的直接代理人，或给他们派去“贸易”和“工业”专家们。他们的活动包括编制关于中国经济、国家的建设与国营工业的生产能力的情报。
