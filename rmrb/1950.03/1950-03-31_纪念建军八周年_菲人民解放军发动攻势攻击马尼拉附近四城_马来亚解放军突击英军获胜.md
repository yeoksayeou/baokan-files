　　Commemorating the Eighth Anniversary of the Army's Founding
    Philippine People's Liberation Army Launches Offensive, Attacks Four Cities Near Manila
    Malayan Liberation Army Wins Battle Against British Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] According to a United Press report from Manila: The Philippine People's Liberation Army attacked four cities within fifty miles of Manila on the evening of the 28th and the morning of the 29th to celebrate its eighth anniversary. The predecessor of the People's Liberation Army was the People's Anti-Japanese Army, which was established on March 29, 1942, in Central Luzon. In this offensive, in addition to killing and wounding many Philippine government soldiers and police, the Liberation Army captured the mayor of Montalban City (about eighteen miles northeast of Manila) and twelve policemen, and seized some grain, medicine, and weapons. At the same time, the Liberation Army distributed leaflets criticizing the Quirino government, and these leaflets were distributed to residents of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
    The development of the Philippine People's Liberation Army has made the US-Philippine reactionaries extremely uneasy. The US government is actively supporting the Quirino government's offensive against the People's Liberation Army. Since the 22nd, under the active participation of Anderson, the head of the US "Military Advisory Group" in the Philippines, Philippine President Quirino has held a series of military meetings to discuss accelerating the shipment of a large number of US military supplies to the Philippines, strengthening and reorganizing the Philippine government armed forces, to intensify the offensive against the People's Liberation Army. According to a United Press report, the US Embassy in the Philippines announced on the 29th that, according to the so-called US-Philippine "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," the United States will hand over 50 fighter planes to the Philippine government on April 3. At the same time, Philippine Deputy Chief of Staff Duque has followed Philippine Defense Minister Connelio to Tokyo in mid-month to consult with MacArthur.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] TASS, Prague, 29th, dispatch citing a Telepress correspondent from Singapore reports: The Malayan National Liberation Army has successfully launched a raid in Kelantan State. The National Liberation Army ambushed a joint British military police force in the area, killing 36 British military police. Since January of this year, the Liberation Army's counter-offensive has continued uninterrupted.

　　纪念建军八周年
    菲人民解放军发动攻势攻击马尼拉附近四城
    马来亚解放军突击英军获胜
    【新华社三十日讯】据合众社马尼拉讯：菲律宾人民解放军于二十八日晚和二十九日晨攻击马尼拉周围五十英里以内的四座城市，以庆祝其成立八周年纪念。人民解放军的前身是人民抗日军，它于一九四二年三月二十九日在中吕宋成立。在这次进攻中，解放军除毙伤菲政府军警多名外，并俘掳芒塔尔班市（在马尼拉东北约十八英里）市长及十二名警察，还缴获了若干粮食、医药和武器。同时，解放军并散发传单，抨击季里诺政府，这些传单曾散发到菲律宾首都马尼拉居民的手中。
    菲律宾人民解放军的发展，使美菲反动派极感不安，美国政府正积极支持季里诺政府进攻人民解放军。自二十二日起，在美国驻菲“军事顾问团”团长安德逊的积极参加下，菲总统季里诺召开了一连串的军事会议，讨论加速将大批美国军用物资运菲，加强并改编菲政府武装部队，以加紧进攻人民解放军。据合众社消息，美驻菲大使馆二十九日宣布：根据所谓美菲“共同防御互助协定”，美国将于四月三日以战斗机五十架交给菲律宾政府。同时，菲副参谋总长杜克已继菲国防部长康利容之后，于本月中旬赴东京向麦克阿瑟有所请示。
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社布拉格二十九日电引电通社记者自新加坡报道：马来亚民族解放军已胜利地在吉连丹州内进行了一次突击。民族解放军在该地突击英国军警联合部队，击毙英国军警三十六人。自今年一月以来，解放军的反攻一直不间断地继续在进行着。
