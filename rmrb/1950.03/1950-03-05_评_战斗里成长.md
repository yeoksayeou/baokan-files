　　Review of "Growing Up in Battle"
　　Zhong Dianfei
　　The play "Growing Up in Battle" is an attempt by the author to illustrate the growth process of the People's Liberation Army through the experiences and struggles of Zhao Tiezhu's family. Its main purpose is to explain the class hatred of its members and core members, who were subjected to humiliation and exploitation in the old society. Therefore, it is not an ordinary "team," but one with a clear goal: to strive for the liberation of its nation and class (and, in the words of Battalion Commander Zhao, for the liberation of all mankind), marching, fighting, and shedding blood.
　　The protagonist of the play, Zhao Gang (Tiezhu)—the son of a poor peasant—after his father lost a lawsuit against the landlord Yang Youde over three mu of paddy fields and died of grief after eating alum (a type of poison), burns the landlord's house in a fit of anger and hastily bids farewell to his wife and children to flee his hometown. After many hardships, he later joins the Eighth Route Army. His wife—a steadfast woman—waits for him for thirteen years through wandering years. Moreover, his youngest son, "Shitou" (Stone), also escapes under the persecution of the traitor and joins the Eighth Route Army. Father and son are in the same battalion but do not know each other, which makes the story develop with great dramatic effect until the time when revenge is taken and the whole family is reunited, when "Shitou's" mother reveals the truth. This is a new legend, but it is a reasonable arrangement and does not damage the realism of the drama because of this accidental coincidence.
　　The play begins with a tragedy and ends with a comedy. Because "the army is advancing," the whole family is reunited, and the result of the army's victorious advance will allow more Zhao Gangs and his families to be reunited. Therefore, although the whole family separates again after meeting on the battlefield, it is a temporary separation to complete the unfinished cause of the revolution, and therefore a separation filled with joy and hope.
　　Naturally, the requirement for a work of art is not abstract logic; it must be reasonable in the development of the story itself, so that it is persuasive. And this play pays attention to this point. Zhao Gang is a cadre, needless to say. Like Zhao's wife, a person who has undergone arduous tests, a woman who is brave in self-sacrifice and unyielding, she can also obtain better results for tens of millions of people with the same fate as her. And young "Shitou," because of the task left to him by the heroic death of his comrade "Sihai," will feel that this is a responsibility from his conscience. Someone asks "Shitou":
　　"Has the revenge been taken?" Shitou answers:
　　"Yes!—No, Sihai's revenge has not been taken yet!"
　　This runs through the idea of ​​"always being a fighting team" in the play, and this point, according to the soldiers who have seen the play, they are moved here, they say: "It is common to not be able to go back to reunite with your family when passing through your hometown while performing a task. ‘Shitou’s’ family cannot be reunited in order to continue fighting. This educational significance is very great. This is for the liberation of all the Chinese people!”
　　The reason why this play is successful and loved is that it realistically portrays the indomitable characters like Zhao Gang, "Shitou," and "Shitou's" mother. He is promising and dares to resist. Zhao Gang and "Shitou" stomping their feet and leaving home twice, and the strong flame of revenge that is ignited in Shitou's heart, all show the extremely precious character of the Chinese people. Furthermore, "Shitou's" mother resolutely waiting for her "virile" man, and Zhao Gang also always remembering his "miserable" wife, this in itself is very much in line with the inherent virtues of the Chinese people. Sihai still thinking about his party dues to be paid this month before being wounded and dying in battle, and telling "Shitou" not to worry about him and to continue to advance, these are all the excellent qualities of thousands of combatants and Communist Party members in the People's Liberation Army. These plots are very moving.
　　This play helps everyone, especially people in the newly liberated areas, understand the reasons why the People's Liberation Army is able to win every battle and conquer every place, and win such a great victory today. It reveals a basic truth to us—the hatred of tens of millions of oppressed people, makes them form a conscious and organized team under the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the key to understanding the People's Liberation Army, and it is also a bold attempt of this play—crossing thirteen years of history in three hours, making this play have a significant educational effect on the audience.
　　In the structure of this play, the author attempts to reproduce a Zhao Gang of the past with Shitou's joining the army; and to embody the ending of victory and reunion with a battalion commander Zhao Gang. The author has put a lot of thought into this structure, making this grand theme have a unique structure, solving a very complex and difficult time problem, and achieving artistic results.
　　However, this play also has some other shortcomings: because its ambition is too great, the existing form cannot completely melt this theme, and the selection of themes and events and the techniques of description are not refined enough, concentrated enough, and have problems in terms of insufficient explanation.
　　A four-act, five-scene drama, attempting to solve such a grand theme, does have many difficulties; it has so much to say, and yet it can say so little. This makes the connection between the acts and the sufficiency of the explanation insufficient. For example, Zhao Zhizhong's death, "Shitou's" joining the army, and Zhao Gang's reappearance as a battalion commander all cause the audience to not have enough time to prepare emotionally before the development of the plot has already flown very far. Some soldiers who have seen this play feel that it has no beginning, and do not know how Yang Youde seized their family's land? How was the lawsuit lost? Who judged the lawsuit? After Zhao Gang escaped, how did he go down to the coal mine? How did the Yang family force them and his mother to leave? How did "Shitou" get injured after joining the army, and how did he stay in the hospital? Otherwise, people would think he was a new recruit—the author should naturally identify these opinions, otherwise it is easy to fall into detailed descriptions. However, the lack of explanation in this play makes many soldiers and the general audience feel dissatisfied after watching it once, unable to grasp the development of the plot, and therefore request that the plot be reported before the opening, all of which are worth the author's consideration in terms of expression methods.
　　The reason why the first act of this play cannot suppress the scene in the performance and cannot obtain a greater effect among the audience, I think it has a great relationship with the author's inability to patiently guide the audience into the environment, and swallowing more of the play behind the scenes. This reminds me: we once had a very long period when the audience and the author were often consistent. The stories unfolded in the play were all familiar to the audience. Therefore, as long as the author expresses one of them, the audience will be able to enrich it with many similar stories, or even their own experiences, when watching. For this reason, we have gradually become accustomed to a method of expression of "telling intimate words to confidants." The suddenness in the plot shown by "Growing Up in Battle" today, I think, has this reason. Therefore, the effect of this play on soldiers is much better than the effect on citizens. If it is performed at a grievance meeting in a unit, its effect will be much greater than it is now.
　　Strictly speaking, the persuasiveness of a work of art is often consistent with its completeness. It requires the author to not only write for the people of the time and place, but also to make people who are not of the time and place feel as if they are experiencing it. "Moscow Character" will naturally still have people who do not understand it when it is performed in Beijing, but as long as people who are relatively close to this kind of life, it is still easy to understand, and it does not feel diminished because it is a foreign play. The valuable historical materials accumulated by the People's Liberation Army for more than ten years, I hope we should be more calm and more patient to excavate it; maybe we only excavate a part, but as long as it is a good, typical part, in terms of effectiveness, it may still be better than the methods we are currently engaged in. On this point, the recently released Soviet film "The Great Turnaround" (Army General) is very worthy of our many people who aspire to reflect the war to learn from.
　　Looking at the play "Growing Up in Battle," the author adopts a method of vertical development, expressing thirteen years of things in three hours. "Shitou" uses three roles to embody it on the stage. And these thirteen years are not ordinary thirteen years, it is two completely different historical eras in China, so the audience requires the life reproduced on the stage to be more refined and more concentrated. However, in this play, the author excessively loves the materials he has obtained in the life of the army, which makes some events and lines not closely integrated with the theme to be expressed in this play, and sometimes even become redundant. The most obvious example is in the second act, the author initially falls into many theoretical issues—the correct understanding of family concepts, the future of the revolution, the issue of returning to the team, the unity and friendship between old and new soldiers, and even the debate on the issue of understanding what it means to be a cadre by the cook Lao Qi. These issues are naturally felt by the author in the life of the army and are indeed (large and small) issues that exist in the army. But it should be said that in a work, the author can only focus on solving one or two main problems. Solving too many problems can easily destroy the integrity of the theme, making the process of Zhao Gang's "growing up in battle" that the author wants to describe not prominent or obvious. Even some ideological issues, if we do not fully explain them before and after, its effect is also worth our consideration. For example, Lao Qi saying that being a cadre is worrying, was originally an interpolation in this play, in the form of telling jokes, which is not important. But what is involved here is an ideological issue. This question was raised but not properly resolved, making the cooks in a certain unit feel that "the play is a good play, but it belittles us cooks too much!" The third act held a battle mobilization meeting on the stage, everyone spoke, and their words were naturally very vivid, but because it was not closely combined with the theme of "growing up in battle," these things are all materials, not the inevitable result of this theme.
　　The reason why a work of art is a work of art, its form, its structure, the mutual care of its language before and after, its expression should have appropriate weight, etc., must be included in our writing and performance considerations. At first glance, these are all formal issues, technical issues, but the reason why an artist is superior to a non-artist, in addition to the fact that he also understands the problems that others understand, is it not precisely that he can properly use the forms and techniques of art? Many of our writers have indeed received quite a lot of life materials in actual struggles, and the materials themselves are extremely valuable. However, because we cannot do better in the expression of "cutting like bone, filing like ivory, carving like jade, polishing like stone," we often appear rough in form; the roughness of artistic form and the looseness of organizational structure are not our advantages, but our shortcomings. As I mentioned earlier, a battle mobilization meeting, the author can put it in "the growth of battle," and it may not be impossible to put it in another work describing battle. This is also the reason for the "similarity in general outline but differences in detail" in many of our artistic works. This "similarity in general outline but differences in detail" problem, from the root, is naturally still due to our generalized understanding of combat life. But when specifically organizing these materials into a work, it is due to our often overly simple artistic attitude, indulging in the superiority of the content, and the result of insufficient deliberation and tempering of artistic forms and expression methods.
　　In terms of directors and actors, it can be seen that everyone has made the greatest effort for this play. Serious, rigorous, every actor on the stage has nourished the play with color. The soldiers reflected that "the style is very good." Especially "Shitou" after joining the army, gave the audience a very fresh and profound impression in embodying the vigorous and courageous and loyal character of the People's Liberation Army; even the Shitou in the first act, second scene also performed very well. Shitou's mother's simplicity and unpretentiousness in acting very well embodies the true colors of a rural working woman. But I think that the Battalion Commander Zhao, who developed from Zhao Tiezhu, has deficiencies in the handling of the character's personality. It can be seen that the actor's intention hopes to express not only Zhao Gang, but also thousands of old cadres in the Liberation Army. However, in the "type" he chose, it is roughly like an old cadre who has experienced ten years of land revolution. I feel that this is not in harmony with the historical development of Zhao Gang. More importantly, the old cadres that the actors are trying to embody do not start more from experiencing his inner feelings, but instead capture many of the old cadres' external forms, which makes the distance between the two images of Zhao Gang before and after too great. The play wants to set off his working-class background by writing that he cannot stand those who wear glasses without eye diseases, but from the current tone and expression, it lacks his kind and straightforward tone, and it seems full of airs. So much so that when he later sees his wife, he always feels a little unnatural in his expression.
　　After the preview of the play "Growing Up in Battle," many old comrades in the drama and art circles watched it and thought it was satisfactory. The opinions I raised above that I thought were worth exploring may not be valid in themselves. But since it is an exploration, there will be various different opinions. At that time, I will be educated. But I have one thing that I can comfort myself with, that is, the author, director, and several main actors of this play, we have all lived together for a long time, but close friendship has not made us remain silent in art; perhaps precisely because we have lived and fought together, I understand better how our road has come, and according to my opinion, how we should go further forward.

　　评“战斗里成长”
    钟惦篚
    “战斗里成长”这个剧本，是作者企图借赵铁柱一家人的遭遇和奋斗历史，来说明人民解放军的成长过程；而其主要的，是要说明它的成员和基干在旧社会中被凌辱与剥削所充满的阶级仇恨；因而它不是一支普通的“队伍”，而是有着明确的奋斗目标，为要获得自己民族和阶级（用赵营长的话来说，还应该是为着全人类）的解放而奔走，而厮杀和流血的。
    剧中的主人公赵刚（铁柱）——一个贫农的儿子，因为父亲为着三亩水地和地主杨有德打官司输了后，气得吃矾（一种毒药）死了。他便在一怒之下，放火烧了地主的房子，匆匆辞别妻儿逃走他乡。经过许多折磨，后来参加了八路军。他的妻子——一个坚贞的女性，在颠沛流离的岁月里等了他十三年。而且小儿子“石头”也在汉奸的逼迫下逃走了，也参加了八路军。父子同在一个营里，但是互不知道，使故事很有戏剧效果的发展到后来报仇雪恨和全家人团聚在一块的时候，才由“石头”的母亲揭穿了这件事。这是一个新的传奇，但却是一个合理的安排，并没有因为这种偶然的巧合，而损害了戏剧的现实性。
    这戏是以悲剧开场，而以喜剧告终的。由于“军队向前进”，全家人团圆了，军队乘胜再往前进的结果，便会使得更多的赵刚和他的家，得到团圆。因此，虽然全家人在战地相逢之后，重又分离，但这是为着完成革命未竟事业的暂时离别，因而是一种充满愉快和希望的离别。
    自然，对于一个艺术品的要求，并不是抽象的逻辑；它须要在故事发展的本身是合理的，这样才有说服性。而这个剧本是注意到了这点的，赵刚是个干部，自不用说，就像赵妻那样一个经过艰难考验的人，一个勇于自我牺牲，坚贞不屈的女性，也是可以为着成千万和她同一命运的人，得到更好的结果的；而年轻的“石头”，由于他的伙伴“四海”英勇的死所留给他的任务，他也会从良心上感到这是一种责任，有人问“石头”：
    “仇报了没有？”石头答应说：
    “报了！——不，四海的仇还没有报哩！”
    这在剧作上贯穿了一个“永远是战斗队”的思想，而这一点，据看过戏的战士们反映，他们在这里受到感动，他们说：“执行任务时，路过自己的家乡不能回去团圆，这是常有的事，‘石头’一家子为了继续战斗，又不能团圆，这个教育意义很大，这是为了解放全中国人民嘛！”
    这个戏之所以成功与被人喜爱，乃是它以现实的手法表现了像赵刚、像“石头”、像“石头”他娘这样不可屈服的性格，他有出息，敢于反抗；赵刚和“石头”两次跺脚离家，在石头心里所煽起的强烈的复仇火焰，这都表现了中国人民极可宝贵的性格。再如“石头”他娘坚决等待他“有种”的男人，赵刚也念念不忘他“苦命”的妻子，这本身是很合乎中国人民固有的美德的。四海在受伤阵亡前还心系不忘他本月应缴的党费，并要“石头”不必管他，继续前进，这都是人民解放军中千万战斗员和共产党员的优良品质。这些情节，是十分动人的。
    这剧本帮助一切人，尤其是新解放区的人，了解人民解放军之所以能够战无不胜，攻无不克，并赢得今天这样一个大的胜利局面的理由，它为我们揭示了一个基本的道理，——成千万被压迫者的仇恨，使他们在共产党的领导下结成一个自觉的有组织的队伍。这是理解人民解放军的锁钥，也是这个剧本大胆的尝试——在三个钟头内跨过了十三年的历史，使这个戏在观众中起了重大的教育作用。
    这剧本的结构，作者企图用石头的参军，再现出一个当年的赵刚；而以一个营长的赵刚，来体现胜利团圆的结局。作者在这一结构上是煞费匠心的，使这一庞大主题在结构上别开生面，解决了一个很复杂很困难处理的时间问题，收到了艺术的效果。
    但是，这个剧本也还存在着它另一些缺点：由于它的企图太大，使现有的形式不能把这一主题完全融化，而在题材、事件的选取和描写的手法上，也还显得不够精练，不够集中以及说明不足等方面的毛病。
    一个四幕五场的话剧，要企图来解决这样一个庞大的主题，确是存在着许多困难的；它要说的事情是那么多，而它所能说的事情又那么少。这便显得各幕之间的衔接以及说明的充分性上不足。如赵志忠的死，“石头”的参军，赵刚作为营长的再现，都使观众在情绪上还没有来得及准备时，剧情的发展已经飞越得很远了。有的战士在看过这个戏后，觉得没有头，不知道杨有德怎么把他们家的地霸占了？官司又是怎么被打输了的？谁断的官司？赵刚逃走后，怎么下的煤窑？杨家又是怎样把他们母子逼走的？“石头”参军后怎么受的伤，怎么住的医院？不然人家就当他是新入伍的了——这种意见，作者自然还要加以识别，不然也容易堕入细节描写之中。但是这个戏在说明性上的不充分，使许多战士和一般观众感到看一遍不满足，把握不住剧情的发展，因而要求在开幕前报告一下剧情，这都是值得作者在表现方法上加以考虑的。
    这戏的第一幕在演出中之所以还压不住场，不能在观众中获得更大的效果，我想与作者不能耐心的引导观众进入环境，而在幕后吞蚀了更多的戏，这是有很大关系的。这里使我想到：我们曾经有过一个很长久的时期，观众与作者经常是一致的。剧中所展开的故事，观众都很熟悉。所以作者只要表现了其中的一点，观众在看的时候，会引起许多同类的故事，甚至是自己的遭遇来丰富它的。因此之故，也逐渐使我们习惯了一种“对知心人，讲知心话”的表现方法。“战斗里成长”这个戏，今天所表现出在情节上的突然，我想是有这个原因的。因而这个戏对战士演出的效果要比对市民的效果好得多，如果在一个部队的诉苦会上演出，它的效果又会比现在的大得多。
    严格地说，一件艺术作品说服力和它的完整性往往是一致的，它要求作者不仅要写给当时当地的人看，而且要使非当时当地的人看了，也觉得历历如在目前。《莫斯科性格》在北京演出，自然也还会有人看不懂，但只要和这种生活比较接近的人，也还是容易懂得的，并不因为它是外国戏便感到减色。人民解放军十多年来所累积的宝贵史料，我希望我们应该是比较从容比较耐心的来发掘它；也许我们所发掘到的只是一部分，但只要是好的，典型的一部分，在收效上，可能还会比现在所从事的方法好些。在这一点上，最近演出的苏联电影“大转变”（陆军大将）是很值得我们许多志在反映战争的人借鉴的。
    在“战斗里成长”这个剧本上看，作者采取了纵深发展的手法，在三个钟头内表现十三年的事情。“石头”在场上是用了三个角色来体现的。而这十三年并不是普通的十三年，它是中国两个全然不同的历史时代，因而观众要求舞台上重现的生活，要更精练、更集中。但是作者在这戏里，却过分的喜爱了他在部队生活中所获得的素材，这就显得有些事件和台辞，和这剧本所要表现的主题结合得不够紧密，有时甚至成了累赘。最显著的例子是在第二幕中，作者一开始便陷于许多理论问题——正确的理解家庭观念问题，革命的前途问题，归队问题，战士新老的团结友爱问题，甚至伙夫老齐对当干部的理解问题的争论。这些问题，自然都是作者在部队生活中感受了、而且确是部队中存在的（大的和小的）问题。但是应该说，在一个作品里，作者只能集中的解决一个或者两个主要问题。解决的问题过多，便极容易破坏主题的完整性，使作者所要描写赵刚在“战斗里成长”的这个过程，反而不突出、不明显了。甚至有些思想问题，如果我们前后关照说明的不充分，它的效果，便也值得我们考虑。比如老齐说当干部操心，在这戏中原是个插笔，是以说笑话的形式，无关重要的。但是这里涉及到的却是一个思想问题。这问题被提出了而未予以适当解决，便使某部队的炊事员看了觉得“戏是好戏，就是对我们当伙夫的糟塌的不轻！”第三幕在场上整整的开了一个战斗动员会，每个人都发了言，他们的话自然都很生动，但是由于它没有和“战斗里成长”这个主题密切结合，便使这些东西都是素材，而不是这一题材必然发展的结果。
    艺术品之所以是艺术品，它的形式，它的结构，它的语言的前后关照，它的表现应有适当的分量等等，都必须列入我们写作与表演的考虑之中。乍看起来，这些都是形式问题，技巧问题，但是艺术家之所以优于非艺术家，除了他也同样了解别人所了解的问题以外，不正是他能够恰当的运用艺术的形式和技巧么？我们有许多作家的确在实际的斗争中领受了相当多的生活素材，而且这些素材的本身都是极可珍贵的。但是由于我们在表现形式上不能更好的作到“如切如磋，如琢如磨”，便使得我们在形式上往往显得粗糙；艺术形式的粗糙，组织结构的不严密，并不是我们的优点，而是我们的缺点。如我前面举例的一次战斗动员会，作者可以把它摆在“战斗的成长里”，也未始不可以把它摆在另一个描写战斗的作品里。这也是我们许多艺术作品中“大同小异”的原因。这种“大同小异”的毛病，从根源上说，自然还是由于我们对于战斗生活理解的一般化来的。但在把这些素材具体的组织到一个作品中去时，却又由于我们在艺术态度上往往过分朴素，沉醉于内容的优越性，而对于艺术形式、表现方法的推敲磨练不够的结果所致的。
    在导演和演员方面，很可以看得出来，大家已经为这剧本尽了最大的努力了。认真、严谨，场上的每一个演员都为这剧本滋润了色彩。战士们反映说：“作派很好”。尤其是参军以后的“石头”，在体现人民解放军的生龙活虎和奋勇忠坚的性格上给了观众以很新鲜很深刻的印象；就是一幕二场的石头也表现得很好。石头他娘在演技上的朴实无华，乃是很出色地体现了一个农村劳动妇女的本色的。但是我以为从赵铁柱发展起来的赵营长，在人物性格的处理上却有不足的地方。很可以看得出来，演员的意图所期望表现的不只是赵刚，而是解放军中成千成万的老干部。但是，他在选取的“型”上，大体是像一个经过十年土地革命的老干部。这一点，我觉得是和赵刚的历史发展不调和的。更重要的，是演员所企图要体现的老干部，没有更多的从体验他内心的感情出发，倒是更多的摄取了许多老干部的外形，这便显得赵刚前后的两个形象的距离太大了。剧本在写他看不惯那些眼睛没病而要带着眼镜的人，原是要想烘托他工农出身的性格，但经现在这种腔调和表情看来，倒是很缺乏他那种亲切直率的口气，而显得架子十足了。以至于后来见着他的妻子时，总是感到在神情上有些不自然。
    “战斗里成长”这个戏，在预演以后，戏剧界、艺术界的许多老同志看过，认为是满意的。我上面提出来以为值得探讨的意见，也许它本身并不能成立。但既是探讨，便会有各种不同的意见。到那时，我将受到教益。但我有一点可以自慰的，乃是这剧的作者、导演以及几个主要演员，我们都曾经长期的在一起生活过，但是亲密的情谊并没有使我们在艺术上保持缄默；也许正因为我们在一起生活和战斗过，使我更明白我们的路是怎样走过来的，并且照我的看法，我们应该如何更向前去。
