　　Introducing a Relatively Formal Adult Night School
　　·Ning Ke·
　　The Second Adult Night School in the Third District, located in a densely populated working-class area of Beijing, is one of the more formal adult night schools. It was established in September of last year. When it was first established, cadres from the district's Culture and Education Section went to mobilize students, but the masses still had concerns. For example, some people hid their teenage daughters, preventing them from attending school. At that time, there were only thirty or forty students, taught by cadres from the Culture and Education Section, focusing only on politics. There was no study organization or study system, and the order was extremely chaotic. Therefore, after a few days of vacation for the National Day celebrations and the Mid-Autumn Festival, only twenty or so children and out-of-school youths remained when school resumed. Consequently, the Culture and Education Section, in coordination with the local police station, re-mobilized and formed two political classes. By November, the night school shifted its focus to cultural learning, dividing students into three classes according to their educational level and inviting nine teachers from the Beidouyacai Hutong Primary School to teach. However, because the primary school teachers were too busy and could not concentrate, coupled with the rotation of teachers, it affected learning. Therefore, in early December, they were replaced by three active individuals from the masses to teach the elementary and intermediate classes, and a school committee was established, with the deputy director of the Public Security Police Station serving as the principal, incorporating students and teachers; textbooks and courses were specified; and students were also divided into groups. In this way, the learning order was greatly improved, students made significant progress, and the number of students increased from seventy or eighty to one hundred and fifty-three. The general public also had a correct understanding of the night school, and the phenomenon of not allowing children to attend school was not only eliminated, but some families, young and old, came to class together.
　　Although the learning at this time was relatively formal, there were still shortcomings. Firstly, the organization of the school committee was too large, with three sections: teaching affairs, recreation, and service, each with several people, but they could only do some administrative work, and the main work was piled on the principal. As the principal was part-time, he couldn't take care of everything, so the school committee was nominal, a mere formality. Secondly, the allocation of courses was inappropriate, with too many political classes and too few cultural classes, and no arithmetic. Thirdly, the students in each class had different levels of education, making teaching difficult.
　　The District Culture and Education Section studied these situations and decided to first improve the leadership structure and then rely on the school committee to make some necessary reforms. After deliberation, the school committee was reorganized in mid-January this year: the three sections were abolished, and a vice-principal was added, Li Shuyuan (a neighborhood leader) who came from the masses of teachers, to lead the organization, administration, and teaching affairs of the night school; and two general affairs officers were selected from the students to help him. The principal was still the deputy director of the police station, who grasped the students' ideological situation and strengthened the connection between the night school and the police station and the masses. At the same time, the working tasks of the school committee in January were determined. According to the instructions of the Bureau of Culture and Education and the specific situation of the school, the school system, curriculum, and regulations on learning system and learning discipline should be initially formulated. After deliberation and discussion by the teachers and students of the night school, it was temporarily stipulated that classes would be held for twelve and a half hours per week, three months per semester, and one and a half years to graduate (equivalent to the level of higher elementary school). Political classes for elementary and intermediate classes were reduced to two hours per week, and advanced classes were reduced to four hours, and arithmetic was added. The elementary and intermediate classes were further divided into two levels, changing to (original text unclear) style. Homeroom teachers were assigned, and a "package class" system was implemented. Regulations on leave, exams, and roll call were also formulated. These regulations were widely solicited from the students, so they could be implemented and adhered to.
　　After twenty days of formal learning in February, the students' cultural level and political awareness have generally improved. In terms of Chinese language, illiterate and slightly literate students have generally learned four hundred characters, second graders have learned four hundred and seventy characters, fourth graders have finished the Party member textbooks, and third graders have reached the twenty-third lesson. Although arithmetic classes have only been held for half a month, first graders have learned to recognize and write Arabic numerals and have learned two-digit addition and subtraction, second graders have learned multi-digit addition and subtraction, and intermediate and advanced classes are equivalent to the level of primary school students of the same grade. In terms of political classes, the elementary class has studied the "Three Enemies and Four Friends," public bonds, the tasks for 1950, and general current affairs policies, while the intermediate and advanced classes are studying the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
　　The students' enthusiasm for learning has been high. When the teachers ask them to solve problems on the blackboard, they all volunteer. One day, the primary school moved the desks and chairs because they were holding an achievement exhibition, and the students surrounded the teachers and asked to stand and attend class. Except for one or two students who had things to do, all participated in the exams. Ma Zhiqin, a working-class woman in the elementary class, is over forty years old, and she copies the lessons until late at night every day, and has now recognized more than four hundred characters. Wang Shumin, who collects coal cinders, used to be illiterate, but now, after collecting coal cinders, she often goes to the reading room (run by the masses themselves) to borrow books to study. The Hong Liang and Hong Bin brothers, who sell sesame paste tea, take out their textbooks to study when business is slow. Sometimes, when both cannot come, they draw lots to attend school; the one who learns teaches the other when they return. The students in the advanced class run their own wall newspaper and take turns managing the reading room.
　　The students' political awareness has also improved significantly. Students can not only explain what they have learned, but also educate the backward masses anytime and anywhere. After hearing about the issue of public bonds, students in the elementary and intermediate classes spontaneously organized and each bought one share of public bonds. Among the masses, the students of the night school can also play a leading role and provide a lot of help to the work of the police station. They often take the lead in clearing snow and cleaning street sanitation.
　　In addition, the relationship between teachers and students is also harmonious. When the teachers arrive, the students surround them. Long after class, the students still don't want to leave. Sometimes, when students have something to do and can't come, the teachers visit their homes. The students' organizational and disciplinary skills have also improved, and they can consciously abide by the rules and obey the leadership of the class leader and the group leader. Before class, the class leader maintains order, and the classroom is not chaotic at all. After school, they all go home in a line, arm in arm, singing songs.
　　The masses are very concerned about the night school. After returning home, Ma Zhiqin often receives encouragement and help from her husband. Zhao Juxian's husband, who keeps accounts in a tea shop, often quizzes her on her lessons when he gets home. Sometimes, when disputes occur among the masses, they also come to the night school teachers to reason.
　　The current problems of the school are: (1) Combined-grade teaching causes disorder and is not effective enough. For example, when teaching the first grade, the second grade also listens, and when teaching the second grade, the first grade waits, which is actually equivalent to only half a class. Later, the following two methods were used:
　　(A) Stagger the lessons: For example, on the first day, leave questions for the third grade to prepare for discussion or calculation, and the next day, after teaching the fourth grade, ask about the results of the third grade's discussion and calculation, and at the same time leave questions for the fourth grade to prepare for tomorrow's discussion or calculation. After implementing this method for the Chinese language classes in the third and fourth grades, not only has the progress been faster, but the students have also improved their understanding and application of the text due to the discussion. However, this method is not applicable to the first and second grades.
　　(B) Implement a group leader tutoring system: The group leaders are mostly students with better grades, and they are responsible for guiding the discussion or calculation. If students have questions, they first ask the group leader. If the group leader doesn't know, they ask the teacher during the quiz. After the question is calculated, the group leader checks it first, and then announces the correct answer during the quiz. These two methods have partially remedied the above shortcomings, and we are now preparing to add some small blackboards to help teaching. However, the fundamental solution is to separate the combined-grade classes after the night school expands.
　　(2) There are still aspects of the current curriculum that deserve improvement, such as adding natural science knowledge.
　　In addition, the textbooks currently used are not very suitable, especially the second grade uses one textbook. New textbooks suitable for adults are urgently needed.
　　(3) The working people are willing to learn, but their learning time must be taken into account. For example, the Hong Liang and Hong Bin brothers, who sell sesame paste tea, haven't finished selling the tea when it's time to study, and after studying, they can't sleep until eleven o'clock, and they have to get up early the next day. Therefore, we have decided to organize some students to help them study during the day. In the current situation, night school is the main form of adult education, but it should not be the only form. How to organize night school students to help people who cannot attend night school to learn is a problem worth paying attention to. Furthermore, the learning of urban scattered laborers should not overemphasize centralization. If going to night school requires running one or two miles, it is a relatively difficult thing for them. Also, the number of people in a class should not be too large, preferably thirty to forty people, more is not conducive to learning.
　　(4) Several primary schools should be established in areas where working people are concentrated. At present, some police stations in the third district do not have a primary school within their jurisdiction, and there is no place for the night school to hold classes, or the place is too narrow to accommodate so many students. With primary schools, the problem of adult education school sites can also be solved.

　　介绍一个比较正规的成人夜校
    ·宁可·
    位于北京劳动人民集中区域的第三区第二成人夜校，是比较正规的成人夜校之一。该校成立于去年九月。刚成立时，区文教科干部去发动学员，群众还有顾虑，譬如有人把十几岁的女儿藏起来，不让上学。当时只有三、四十个学生，由文教科干部教课，只讲政治。学习组织与学习制度也没有，秩序异常混乱。因此，在开国盛典及中秋节放了几天假后，再开学时就只剩下二十几个小孩和失学青年了。于是文教科配合派出所重新动员，成立了两班政治班。到十一月份时，夜校改成以文化学习为主，把学生依文化程度编成三班，请了九位北豆芽菜胡同小学的老师来教课。但由于小学教师太忙，精神不能专注，再加上轮流教课，影响学习。所以到十二月初，便换了三位群众中的积极分子来教初级班和中级班，并建立了校委会，由公安派出所副所长兼任校长，吸收学生和教师参加；规定了教材和课程；学生也划分成小组。这样，学习秩序大为改善，学生也有了显著的进步，人数从七、八十人增到一百五十三人。一般群众对夜校也有了正确的认识，不许子女上学的现象不但消除了，有的一家老小几口都来上课。
    这时的学习虽已较正规，但仍有缺点。首先是校委会的组织过于庞大，设了教务、康乐、服务等三个股，每股好几个人，但只能做些事务工作，主要的工作都堆在校长身上。而校长是兼职，照顾不来，因此校委会有名无实，形成虚设。其次是课程的分配不合适，政治课过多，文化课少，没有算术。第三、各班学生程度不一，教学困难。
    区文教科研究了这些情况，决定首先健全领导机构，然后依靠校委会来做一些必要的兴革。经过酝酿，今年一月中旬改组了校委会：取消了三个股，添设了一个副校长，由从群众中来的教员李书元（闾长）担任，领导夜校的组织、行政及教务工作；并从学生中选出两个总务来帮助他。校长则仍由派出所副所长担任，掌握学生思想情况，并加强夜校与派出所及群众的联系。同时并确定校委会一月份的工作任务，应依据文教局的指示及本校具体情况，初步地制订学制、课程及规定学习制度与学习纪律。经过夜校师生的酝酿讨论，暂时规定每星期上课十二小时半，三个月一学期，一年半毕业（相当高小程度）。政治课初级班及中级班减少为每星期两小时，高级班减为四小时，添了算术。把初级班及中级班再分为两级，改成（原稿不清）式。确定了级任教员，实行“包班”制。又订出请假、考试、点名等制度。这些规定，都普遍地征求了学生的意见，因此都能执行并坚持。
    经过二月零十天的正规学习，学生的文化程度与政治认识都普遍地提高了。国语方面，文盲和略微识字的学生一般的都学会了四百字，二年级已学会了四百七十字，四年级学完了党员课本，三年级已学到第二十三课。算术上课虽只有半个月，一年级已从认写阿拉伯字码学到二位加减法，二年级已学会多位加减法，中级班及高级班相等于小学同年级的水平。政治课方面，初级班已经学过三敌四友、公债、一九五○年的任务及一般时事政策，中级班与高级班正在学习人民政协共同纲领。
    学生的学习情绪一直很高。老师叫上黑板演算题，都能自告奋勇。有一天小学因为要举办成绩展览，把课室的桌凳搬走了，学生就围着老师要求站着上课。考试时除了一两个有事的都参加。初级班的工属妇女马志清，四十多岁了，每天回家抄写课直到深夜，现在已识四百多字。捡煤核的王淑敏，过去不识字，现在捡完煤核，常到阅报处（群众自己办的）借书回去学习。推车卖面茶的洪亮、洪斌兄弟二人，在买卖较闲时就掏出课本来学习。有时两人不能回来，就抽签上学；学了回去再教另外一个。高级班的同学自己办了壁报，并且轮流管理阅览室。
    学生的政治觉悟也有显著的提高。学生不仅能讲出所学过的东西，并且还能随时随地对落后的群众进行教育。初级班和中级班的学生在听过公债问题之后，自动组织起来各买了一分公债。在群众中，夜校的学生也都能起带头作用，给了派出所工作不少的帮助。他们经常带头清扫积雪和街道卫生。
    此外，师生感情也很融洽。老师一来，学生就围上来。下课很久，学生还不想走。有时学生有事不能来，老师就去学生家中访问。学生的组织性与纪律性也都有提高，能自觉地遵守制度，服从班长和小组长的领导。上课之前，班长维持秩序，课室一点不乱，放学之后，都是排着队，挽着手，唱着歌回家。
    群众对夜校是很关心的。马志清回家后，经常得到他丈夫的鼓励和帮助。赵菊仙的丈夫，在茶叶庄管账，回家以后常考问她的功课。有时群众发生了纠纷，也来找夜校教员说理。
    该校目前存在的问题是：（一）复式教学造成秩序紊乱，且效果也不够好。如给一年级上课时二年级也听，给二年级上课时一年级就等着，实际等于只上半堂课，后来用了下面两个办法：
    （甲）把功课错开来：如头一天给三年级留下题，让他们准备讨论或演算，第二天给四年级上完课后，便抽问三年级讨论及演算的结果，同时又给四年级留下题，准备明天讨论或演算。三、四年级的国文课实行这个办法后，不仅进度快了，且学生因经过讨论，对课文理解与应用方面更提高了一步。但这一办法不适用于一二年级。
    （乙）实行小组长辅导制：小组长多是功课较好的学生，由他们来掌握讨论或演算，如学生有疑问，先问小组长，小组长若不会，到抽问时问老师，把题算好了，小组长先看，到抽问时再宣布正确的答案。这两个办法部分地补救了上述缺点，现正准备添些小黑板来帮助教学。但根本解决的办法还是夜校扩大后，把复式班分开来。
    （二）目前课程仍有值得改进处，如增添自然常识。
    另外，现在用的教材也不太适合，尤其是二班用一个课本。新的适合成人用的课本是迫切需要的。
    （三）劳动人民愿意学习，但要照顾其学习时间。如卖面茶的洪亮洪斌弟兄，面茶还卖不完，就到了学习时间，学完了回去，十一点才能睡，第二天又要早起。因此我们决定组织一部分学生在白天帮助他们学习。在目前情况下，夜校是成人教育的主要方式，但不应该是唯一的方式，如何组织夜校的学生去帮助不能上夜校的人民学习，是一个值得注意的问题。再者，城市的零散劳动者的学习，不能过分强调集中，如果因为上夜校要跑一两里路，在他们说来是一件比较困难的事。还有，一班人数也不宜过多，以三十至四十人为宜，多了反而不利学习。
    （四）在劳动人民集中的区域，应该多办几个小学。目前三区有的派出所管界内一所小学也没有，夜校无处上课，或者地方太窄容纳不下那么多学生。有了小学，也就能解决成人教育校址的问题。
