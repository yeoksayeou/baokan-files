Learning from the "White-Clad Warriors"
    Jiang Qixian
    In old China, there was a popular saying, "A military doctor is a loafer." The impression of old military doctors was: lacking skills, undisciplined, loafing around, and living a life of debauchery. Perhaps some of this is an exaggeration. But due to the reactionary nature of the old army, it is a fact that even good doctors in the old army found it difficult to use their talents. The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, and the military doctors of the People's Liberation Army naturally have a new style of work. The military doctors of the People's Liberation Army, with a new attitude, the heroic posture of the people's soldiers, appear before the people. Medical personnel serve the people, combining politics and technology, sacrificing themselves to save others, and practicing revolutionary humanitarianism—this completely new medical style began with the medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army in the history of Chinese medicine. Since the Red Army era, the medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army have established this style: sharing weal and woe with the soldiers, going to the front line with the soldiers, rescuing and transferring, not abandoning a single wounded soldier; when necessary, sacrificing oneself to save the wounded; not only completing technical tasks, but also being fully responsible for the overall health and military and political tasks of the soldiers, caring about everything. The film "White-Clad Warriors," recently produced by the Northeast Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau, depicts just such a person. The heroine Captain Zhuang in the play is an example, a representative, of inheriting the glorious tradition of military doctors since the Chinese Red Army.
    For more than 20 years, there have been many moving heroic deeds on the health front of the People's Liberation Army. Unfortunately, in the past we have not used artistic forms to commend and disseminate them. "White-Clad Warriors" has fulfilled this task. It is the beginning of this important commendation and dissemination work.
    Those who do not know the true situation of the PLA's medical work will see a corner of the real great scene from this film. It tells the audience: It is glorious and great to be a good military doctor in the People's Liberation Army! But naturally, it is also difficult, because he must first be a soldier of the people!
    Medical workers, after watching this film, will receive profound education: to be a good medical worker, whether in the army or locally, must learn from the "White-Clad Warriors."
    Of course, the heroic deeds on the health front of the People's Liberation Army are not limited to what we see in this film. In reality, there are more comprehensive examples than Captain Zhuang. This remains for us to continue to discover and commend. (Attached picture)

　　向“白衣战士”学习
    姜齐贤
    在旧中国里，流行着一句话，“吊儿郎当是军医”。旧军医给人的印象是：一无技能，二无纪律，吊儿郎当，醉生梦死。这也许有些是过火的说法。但由于旧军队的反动性，在旧军队里做医生，即使是很好的医生，也很难发挥他的才能，却是事实。解放军是人民的军队，解放军的军医自然有新的工作作风。人民解放军里的军医们，是以新的姿态，人民战士的英雄姿态出现在人民面前的。医务人员为人民服务，政治与技术结合，舍己救人，实行革命的人道主义——这种完全新的医疗作风，在中国医学的历史上，是从人民解放军的医务人员开始的。人民解放军的医务人员自从红军时代开始，就已树立了这种作风：与战士共甘苦，与战士一起上火线，抢救转移，不丢掉一个伤员；在必要时，牺牲自己而拯救伤员；不仅只要完成技术上的任务，还必须对战士的整个健康和军事政治任务全面负责，事事关心。最近中央电影局东北电影制片厂所摄制的影片《白衣战士》，正是描写了这样一个人物。剧中的女英雄庄队长正是继承着中国红军以来军医光荣传统的一个例子，一个代表。
    二十多年来，在人民解放军的卫生战线里，是有着许多可歌可泣的英雄事绩的，可惜过去我们没有通过艺术形式加以表扬，加以传播。而《白衣战士》是尽了这个任务的。它正是这一项重要的表扬传播工作的开始。
    不知道解放军医疗工作的真实情况的人，将从这部片子里看到真实的伟大场景里的一个角落。它告诉观众：在人民解放军里做一个好的军医是光荣的，伟大的！但自然，也是艰难的，因为他必须首先是一个人民的战士！
    医务工作者们，看了这部片子，将会受到深刻的教育：要做一个好的医务人员，不论是在军队里或是地方上，都必须向《白衣战士》学习。
    自然，解放军卫生战线上的英勇事绩还不仅仅限于我们在这部片子里所看到的这一部分。在现实中还存在有比庄队长更全面的典型，这有待于我们再接再厉地去发现与表扬。（附图片）
