　　Lin County Xiyu Branch Achieves the Party's Leadership in Production
    Yao Guang
    The Xiyu Branch of Lin County was named a model branch at the Party Congress last October. The Xiyu Branch achieved remarkable results in leading production last year. Its experience is introduced as follows:
  I. How the Branch Leads Production
    Formulating Conventions Through People's Representative Meetings
    In the spring of 1949, just after the land reform ended, the masses generally harbored concerns about getting rich through labor. On the one hand, the branch mobilized party members to influence the masses with practical actions. For example, the mutual aid group led by party member Luo Jinxiang, in addition to farming, jointly burned a lime kiln, earning 15 shi of wheat before autumn, buying four mu of land, and lending out 500 jin of wheat. On the other hand, the branch not only publicized the production policy but also carried out internal and external criticism and struggle against party member Guo Chaoquan, who violated the lending policy. Guo Chaoquan borrowed several dou of mung beans from others but returned unsunned mung beans. This was corrected after criticism. During the production process, the branch discovered phenomena such as borrowed furniture being damaged and not repaired, and livestock not being given fodder. After the activities of party members, the following conventions were established through the People's Representative Meeting:
    (1) Borrowed furniture must be compensated if damaged.
    (2) Fodder should be provided when borrowing livestock.
    (3) It is forbidden for sheep to eat wheat seedlings; those that eat them in winter must compensate with manure, and those that eat them in spring must guarantee the harvest.
    (4) It is forbidden to destroy small trees when gathering firewood, and even more forbidden to dig up the roots of trees on the riverbanks to prevent the land from being washed away in the summer.
    Because the branch implemented the production policy, it inspired the masses' enthusiasm for production. Before autumn, the branch originally planned to buy 27 new livestock, but as a result, 29 were bought. Farmer Xu Genming only accumulated four mu of fertilizer the year before because he did not understand the policy. Last year, he accumulated 38 mu of fertilizer before autumn alone.
    Setting Production Plans According to the Season
    After the summer harvest, there was a drought. The branch led the masses to dig 500 mu of jade corn kilns in advance. Later, after half a rain, they immediately organized the rush planting. As a result, the early planting yielded two more dou per mu than the late planting. Because the village lacked fertilizer, in early spring, the branch mobilized the masses to carry 36,000 jin of coal, saving firewood and grass to be compressed into fertilizer. As a result, fertilizer was increased for 800 mu of land more than the previous year. Each labor force in the village had to cultivate an average of 21 mu of land. In previous years, 700 workers had to be hired to complete the weeding. Last year, the branch mobilized a total of 230 women to go to the fields, and under the leadership of party members, 41 mutual aid groups were organized. As a result, not a single short-term worker was used in the weeding. After autumn, the branch planned autumn plowing. All 1,100 mu of barren land in the village were plowed in eight days except for 50 mu. After entering winter, winter production such as sideline occupations, firewood gathering, fertilizer accumulation, and adobe making was organized.
    Developing Cooperation and Mutual Assistance
    Under the leadership of the branch, the village cooperative overcame the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and moved towards a supply and marketing path that serves production. In the spring, it absorbed 2,800 jin of hemp seeds from cooperative members in exchange for 2,800 jin of salt, which was sold to the masses. To support agricultural production, it purchased 70 hoe blades, 13 plows, 45 plowshares, 70 sets of ropes, 120 sickles, and 30 mattocks based on the needs of the masses. The above-mentioned agricultural tools were all sold to cooperative members below market prices. At the same time, seed coordination was carried out, and the masses were organized to transport them. After autumn, coal for 20,000 jin of wheat was ordered and supplied to the masses. In terms of mutual assistance: there were 22 regular small mutual aid groups and 19 temporary ones, with a total of 18 households participating, and party members were the backbone of them. For example, the Guo Zhenping group, whose members included a party member, completed the autumn harvest and wheat planting in 16 days after the branch called for it to be done in 17 days.
    Summarizing and Commending Models, Carrying Out Competitions
    After each plan was completed, the branch conducted a summary. During the summary of the three autumn harvests, 16 production models were elected and rewarded. At the time of autumn planting, in order to increase yield and reduce pests and diseases, the branch called for warm water seed soaking and organized a competition. The Communist Youth League and the militia used persuading one household as a competition condition. As a result, 90% of the wheat fields in the village were soaked in warm water.
    II. Close Contact Between the Branch and the Masses is the Key to Carrying Out the Production Movement
    Because the branch has established close contact with the broad masses, significant achievements have been made in production. The methods are as follows:
    The Branch Adopts the Opinions of the Masses and Makes Correct Resolutions
    When formulating resolutions and checking resolutions, the branch absorbs representatives of the masses to attend the meetings, so that the party and the masses can communicate frequently. For example, when the branch was studying and preparing the winter production plan to be submitted to the People's Representative Meeting, the masses attending the meeting also provided very valuable opinions, such as: (1) To facilitate the masses in carrying coal, the cooperative should first determine the coal at the coal kiln to reduce the procedures for the masses to obtain coal; (2) The masses lack baskets, and it is necessary to organize the cutting of thorny branches to weave baskets to supply to the masses, etc. The branch adopted the opinions of the masses and made resolutions. In this way, not only can the branch revise errors and determine methods to promote the production movement based on the opinions of the masses. It also encourages the representatives of the masses, who help the branch publicize to the masses, so the branch plan is easy to turn into mass action.
        Turning Branch Resolutions into Resolutions of the People's Representative Meeting
    After the branch makes a resolution, party members distribute it to the masses at the meal market for publicity. Party members in the People's Representative Meeting then make suggestions to the People's Representative Meeting, and after detailed discussion, a resolution is made. If the branch resolution is inappropriate or incomplete, the People's Representative Meeting can supplement and revise it. For example, when formulating the production convention, the branch proposed that sheep flocks should not be allowed to eat wheat seedlings. The representatives believed that this was too general and that a method of compensation for losses should be stipulated if wheat seedlings were eaten. In order to meet the needs of the masses for agricultural tools, the branch made a resolution to have the cooperative organize people to cut back thorny branches from the mountains and then hire people from other villages to weave baskets. When the resolution was submitted to the People's Representative Meeting, the representatives felt that it was too troublesome and that the method of signing contracts with weavers could be implemented. After the resolution of the People's Representative Meeting was distributed and communicated, party members took the lead in implementing it. The branch also paid attention to cultivating the prestige of the Representative Meeting, respecting the opinions of the representatives, and even if the opinions of the representatives were incorrect, the branch carefully considered them and corrected them by persuading the representatives attending the People's Representative Meeting.
    Giving Play to the Strength of Mass Organizations to Ensure the Completion of Various Tasks
    The branch meeting is held before the regular meeting of the militia and the Communist Youth League. The party's resolutions rely on party members in various organizations to take them to the masses for discussion and turn them into resolutions of various organizations. Especially important plans, because mass organizations exert their strength, can fully mobilize the masses. For example, under the influence of party member Guo Zhenping, 34 militiamen participated in the mutual aid group, and four militiamen became group leaders. The branch called for the completion of cotton planting in five days, and some militiamen completed it in three days. The branch called for the repair of ponds, and the militiamen took the lead in carrying stones for a day; after broadcasting praise to the militiamen, the masses of the whole village moved the next day. The militia divided the area into six security zones, responsible for each zone, and patrolled at night. The two theft cases that occurred in the village were detected. Therefore, social order was stable, and the masses were very satisfied. For example, the Communist Youth League members have all made personal production and study plans. In addition to taking the lead in selecting seeds for warm water soaking, they also mobilized 74 people to carry water for military families. In addition to formulating various plans, the Women's Federation also launched maternal and child health work.
    III. Building Branches in Production
    The Branch Established a Party Day System
    Regularly check the extent to which resolutions are implemented and conscientiously conduct self-criticism. For example, when fighting Anyang City last year, the higher authorities arranged for Xiyu to mobilize 15 sacks, and party member Wang Jinshu completed the task by using administrative orders. Everyone criticized his style. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, several branch committee members regarded the establishment of the Communist Youth League as the central task, but relaxed the leadership of the autumn harvest. During the Party Day, everyone criticized the branch committee members, and the branch committee members immediately corrected it after the meeting. For example, after Xiyu was selected as a model branch, the branch secretary developed a sense of complacency, so the branch also criticized him, and he quickly overcame it.
    Electing the Branch Committee
    To strengthen the leadership of the party in the production movement, it is necessary to promote intra-party democracy. Last winter, on the basis of summarizing the work of the year, the branch conducted the election of the branch committee, and the original deputy secretary was not re-elected due to incompetence.
    Carefully Recruiting New Party Members in Production
    Replenishing the fresh blood of the party, the branch originally had many adults, but the absorption of some young party members greatly changed the atmosphere of the branch. The branch has a total of 38 party members, and the number of those developed last year accounted for 15. Many progressive elements requested to join the party.

　　林县西峪支部实现党在生产中的领导作用
    姚光
    林县西峪支部去年十月在党代会议上，被评成模范支部。西峪支部去年一年在领导生产上有显著成绩。现将其经验介绍如下：
  一、支部是如何领导生产的
    通过人民代表会议制定公约
    一九四九年的春天，土改刚结束，在群众中还普遍的存在着不敢劳动致富的思想顾虑。支部一方面动员党员以实际行动来影响群众，如党员骆金祥所领导的互助组，除耕种外，还合伙烧石灰窑于秋前赚麦十五石，买地四亩，并贷出麦子五百斤。另方面支部不仅宣传了生产政策而且向违犯了借贷政策的党员郭朝全，开展了党内外的批评和斗争。郭朝全，借了别人几斗绿豆，可是还人家的是未晒干的绿豆，经批评后得到了纠正。在生产过程中，支部发现借家具用坏了不修理，使用牲口不给草料的现象后，经过了党员的活动，通过人民代表会议，定出公约如下：
    （１）借用家具坏了必须赔偿。
    （２）借使牲口管草料。
    （３）禁止羊群吃麦苗，冬天吃了的赔粪，春天吃的包收成。
    （４）打柴禁毁小树，更不许刨土岸上的树根，以防夏季冲坏地。
    由于支部贯彻了生产政策，启发了群众的生产积极性。秋前支部原计划新买牲口二十七头，结果买了二十九头。农民徐艮明前年因对政策不了解，只积了四亩肥，去年仅秋前就积了三十八亩肥。
    按季节定生产计划
    夏收后天旱，支部领导群众预先刨好了五百亩玉茭窑。后来下了半场雨，立即组织抢种。结果早种比迟种的每亩多收二斗。因本村肥料缺乏，春初，支部发动群众驮煤三万六千斤，省下了柴草压成肥，结果比前年多增八百亩土地的肥料。该村每个劳力平均须种二十一亩地，往年锄苗时必须雇七百个工才能锄完。去年支部共发动了妇女二百三十人下地，并且在党员带头下，组织了四十一个互助组，结果在锄苗中未用一个短工。秋后支部计划了秋耕，全村一千一百亩白地，八天时间除五十亩外全部犁完了。入冬后又组织了副业、打柴、积肥、打土坯等冬季生产。
    开展合作互助
    该村合作社，在支部领导下克服了单纯营利观点，走向为生产服务的供销道路。春季吸收社员二千八百斤大麻子，换回盐二千八百斤出售给群众。在扶植农业生产上，根据群众要求，代购了七十个锄板，十三张犁，四十五个犁铧，七十付套绳，一百二十张镰，三十把镢头。上述农具均低于市价售给社员。同时进行了调剂种籽，组织群众运输；秋后定购两万斤麦子的煤供给了群众。在互助方面：经常的小型互助组二十二个，临时的十九个，共有十八户参加，党员是其中的骨干。如党员郭振平组，支部号召十七天完成秋收种麦，他们十六天就完成了。
    总结表模，开展竞赛
    每当计划完成之后，支部都要进行一次总结。在总结三秋中，选举出十六个生产模范，并予以奖励。秋种时为了提高产量减少病虫害，支部号召了温汤浸种，并组织了竞赛。青年团和民兵以说服一户为竞赛条件。结果全村百分之九十的麦田都进行了温汤浸种。
    二、支部密切联系群众，是开展生产运动的关键
    由于支部和广大群众取得了密切联系，使生产获得了显著成绩。其办法有以下几种：
    支部采纳群众意见，作出正确决议
    支部在制定决议和检查决议时，吸收群众代表列席会议，使党和群众经常通气。如支部在研究准备向人民代表会议提出的冬季生产计划时，列席会议的群众，也提供了很宝贵的意见，如：（一）便于群众驮煤，合作社应先去煤窑上把煤定好，减少群众取煤手续；（二）群众缺箩头，应组织割荆条编箩头，供给群众等。支部采纳群众意见作成决议。这样不但支部可以根据群众意见修正错误定出推动生产运动的办法。同时也鼓舞了群众代表，他们帮助支部向群众作了宣传，因此支部计划就容易变成群众行动。
        把支部决议变成人民代表会议决议
    支部决议后，党员便分片在饭市上向群众作宣传。人民代表会议中的党员，则向人民代表会议提出建议，经过详细讨论作出决议。支部决议若有不妥或不全面的地方，人民代表会议上便可给予补充修正。如制定生产公约时，支部提出不准羊群吃麦苗，代表认为这样太笼统，应规定吃了麦苗包赔损失的办法。为了满足群众农具需要，支部作出了让合作社组织人去山上割回荆条来，再从外村雇人编箩头的决议。提到人民代表会议上，代表认为太麻烦，可实行和编匠订合同的方式。人民代表会议决议分片传达后，党员首先带头执行。支部并注意培养代表会的威信，尊重代表意见，即便代表意见不正确，支部也要慎重考虑，经过党员说服人民代表会议到会代表加以纠正。
    发挥群众组织力量，保证完成各种任务
    支部会开在民兵青年团例会之前，党的决议依靠各组织中的党员，拿到群众中去讨论，作成各个组织的决议。特别是重要计划，由于群众组织发挥力量，便能充分发动群众。如在党员郭振平的影响下，三十四个民兵都参加了互助组，有四个民兵当了组长。支部号召五天完成种棉，有的民兵三天即完成了。支部号召修池，民兵先动手抬了一天石头；经过对民兵的广播表扬，第二天全村群众都动开了。民兵划分了六个警备区，按片负责，夜间放哨，村上发生的两次偷案，都被查住了。因而社会秩序安定，群众非常满意。再如青年团员都订了个人生产学习计划，除带头选种温汤浸种外，并发动了七十四人给军属担水。妇代会除制定了各种计划外，并展开了妇婴卫生工作。
    三、在生产中建设支部
    支部建立了党日制度
    经常检查决议的执行程度，认真地开展自我批评。如去年打安阳城时，上级布置西峪动员十五个麻袋，党员王金书采用行政命令办法完成了任务，大家对他的作风展开了批评。秋收开始时几个支委把建团当成了中心工作，而放松了对秋收的领导，过党日时大家批评了支委，会后立即得到纠正。再如西峪被选为模范支部后，支书产生了自满情绪，于是支部也对他作了批评，很快得到了克服。
    选举支委会
    加强党在生产运动中领导作用，必须发扬党内民主。去年冬季支部在总结一年的工作基础上，进行了支委会的选举，原来副支书因不称职而落选了。
    在生产中慎重地吸收了新党员
    充实了党内的新鲜血液，该支部原来壮年人多，由于吸收些青年党员，使支部空气大为转变。支部共三十八个党员，去年一年发展的即占十五个。不少进步分子要求入党。
