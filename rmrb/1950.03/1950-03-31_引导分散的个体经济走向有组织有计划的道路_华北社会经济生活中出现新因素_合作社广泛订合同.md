　　Guiding Scattered Individual Economies Towards an Organized and Planned Path
    New Factors Emerge in the Socio-Economic Life of North China
    Cooperatives Widely Sign Contracts
    [Our Newspaper] Cooperatives are widely adopting the new method of operating through contracts. These contracts establish relatively close links between cooperatives and state-owned trading organizations, between cooperatives themselves, and between cooperatives and private industries. This has created a new factor in the socio-economic life of North China. Fundamentally, this represents a more organized and planned economic situation within the broad, scattered individual economy, under the leadership of the state-owned economy and with cooperatives as the link.

    According to incomplete statistics, cooperatives in the four provinces and two municipalities of North China signed 2,451 contracts with various parties last year (mainly in the latter half of the year). In the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi, a network of contracts has been formed through 2,148 cooperative contracts. This is a phenomenon worthy of close attention. The adoption of contract-based operations by cooperatives in various parts of North China was proposed at the Taihang District Economic Reorganization Conference in March 1949. This method was not only implemented first in the Taihang District, but also promoted in Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and other provinces after the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative introduced this experience. Since July of last year, based on available materials, the 15 county cooperatives in the Changzhi District of Shanxi Province have signed 2,148 contracts. The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative and the Fanshi and Shenchi County Cooperatives have signed a total of 11 contracts. Cooperatives in Chahar Province have signed a total of 180 contracts. Cooperatives in Hebei Province have signed a total of 39 contracts. Cooperatives in Pingyuan Province have signed a total of 2 contracts. The Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a total of 48 contracts. The Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a total of 14 contracts. The Tianjin Branch of the North China Freight Depot has signed a total of 4 contracts. The Cooperative Bank has signed 4 loan contracts. The Changlu Salt Industry Company has signed 1 consignment contract.

    Direction of Development: Further Strengthen Connections with Grassroots Cooperatives, Neighboring District Cooperatives, and State-Owned Trading Organizations to Form a Supply and Marketing Network and Develop Urban-Rural Trade in a Planned Manner.

    Judging from the nature of the contracts signed in various places, there are exchange, ordering, purchasing on behalf of, pre-purchasing, consignment, ordering for sale, transportation, loan, and agreement forms. The contract partners include state-owned trading organizations, but the main partners are cooperatives themselves and private handicraft and industrial enterprises. Among the 180 contracts signed by various cooperatives in Chahar Province, 59 were ordering contracts with private handicraft workers, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total number of contracts. Among the 1,574 contracts signed by the Huguan and other nine county cooperatives in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi, 1,298 were exchange contracts with village cooperatives, accounting for more than 82% of the total number of contracts. Because the Beijing Cooperative is located in the city, it signed 26 processing contracts with private factories, accounting for more than one-half of the total number of contracts. From the perspective of the direction of development, it is necessary to strengthen connections with grassroots cooperatives, neighboring district cooperatives, and state-owned trading organizations in the future. Only by channeling all transactions of agricultural and industrial products through the contract-based operations of cooperatives to form a supply and marketing network can intermediate exploitation be reduced and urban-rural trade be developed in a planned manner.

    The reason why cooperatives in various places have widely adopted the contract system is that after the great development of the revolutionary situation, the focus of work has shifted from the countryside to the cities, and the operating methods of state commerce require a transformation—from a decentralized and simple operating method to a scientific, planned, and organized operating method. Implementing the contract system is an important method to promote this development. Based on the situation of the implementation of cooperatives in various places in the past six months, this effect has occurred in varying degrees.

    Advantages of Adopting the Contract System: Overcoming Blindness in Urban-Rural Exchange; Eliminating Intermediate Exploitation; Organizing and Assisting Small Producers; Reducing Waste of Manpower and Materials

    The advantages of cooperatives adopting the contract system are first reflected in organizing the masses to carry out urban-rural material exchange in a planned manner, overcoming the blindness of urban-rural exchange, shortening the supply and marketing process of industrial and agricultural products in the market, and reducing anarchy in the urban and rural markets. For example, the Wulihou Village Cooperative in Lucheng, Shanxi, through 24 exchange contracts, supplied its members with necessities worth 480,000 jin of millet, and promoted the sales of industrial raw materials worth 290,000 jin of millet.

    Secondly, the contract system enables state commerce to form a retail procurement network in the market, directly supplying and marketing industrial and agricultural products, eliminating intermediate exploitation, stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for production, and helping the development of the national economy. For example, at the beginning of December last year, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative planned to sell 1,800 bundles of straw ropes (5 zhang per bundle) from farmers, and supplied the needs of state-owned factories on schedule, eliminating intermediate exploitation and ensuring the interests and planning of both parties' production. One bundle of hemp rope now only costs 6 jin of rice, while in the past it cost 10 jin. If the bidding method of the past was used, large merchants would control small producers, and state-owned enterprises and small producers would suffer.

    Thirdly, the contract system also plays a significant role in assisting and organizing small-scale industrial production. For example, the private iron furnace industry in Wanquan County, Chahar, was mostly scattered and unorganized before the contracts were signed, and production was unplanned. In order to make money, the sickles were mostly inferior goods, with high prices and low sales. After signing contracts with the cooperatives, they were manufactured in large quantities according to certain specifications, and the cost of each sickle was reduced from 12 jin of rice to 6 jin of rice. The cooperative then placed a large order at a price of 6.5 jin of rice. This not only greatly supplied the needs of farmers, but also helped solve the sales problem of sickles and ensured the reasonable profits of the craftsmen, allowing them to develop properly. In this way, these scattered small producers were organized through contracts.

    In addition, the adoption of the contract system also reduces the waste of manpower and materials. For example, the use of transportation contracts avoids the futile round trips of many human and animal forces and can prevent theft, adulteration, and tampering.

    Vigorously promoting the cooperative contract system is one of our important economic tasks.

　　引导分散的个体经济走向有组织有计划的道路
    华北社会经济生活中出现新因素
    合作社广泛订合同
    【本报讯】合作社广泛采用订合同这一新方式来经营，经过合同使合作社与国营贸易机关之间，合作社相互之间，以及合作社与私人工业之间，建立比较密切的联系，已使华北的社会经济生活中，出现了一个新的因素。这，从基本上说来，即是在国营经济领导下的，以合作社为纽带的，在广泛的分散的个体经济中的比较有组织与有计划的经济情况。
    据不完全的统计，华北四省二市之合作社，在去年（主要是后半年）内已与各方订立了两千四百五十一次合同。在山西的长治专区，已由二千一百四十八次合作社合同，组成了合同网。这是值得十分注意的现象。华北各地合作社采用订合同的经营方式，是一九四九年三月太行区经济整编会议上提出的。这一方法，不仅首先在太行区实行，而且经华北供销合作社介绍这一经验后，在河北、山西、察哈尔等省均先后推广。从去年七月以来，就已知材料来说，山西长治区十五个县社即订立合同二千一百四十八次。山西省社与繁峙、神池两县社共订合同十一次。察哈尔省各社共订立合同一百八十次。河北省各社共订合同三十九次。平原省各社共订合同二次。北京市供销社共订合同四十八次。天津市供销社共订合同十四次。华北货栈天津分社共订四次。合作银行订贷款合同四次。长芦盐业公司订代销合同一次。
    发展的方向  还要加强与基层社、邻区社及国营贸易机关的联系，组成供销网，有计划地发展城乡贸易。
    从各地所签订合同的性质来看，有交换、订购、代购、预购、代销、订销、运输、贷款、协议等形式之分；订立合同的对象除与国营贸易机关订合同外，主要是合作社相互间以及与私营手工业与工业之间所订的合同。察省各社所订合同一百八十次中，与私营手工业者订了五十九次订购合同，占合同总数三分之一弱；山西长治专区壶关等九县社所订一千五百七十四次合同中，与村社订交换合同即达一千二百九十八次，占合同总数的百分之八十二以上。北京市社因处于城市，与私营工厂订加工合同二十六次，占合同总数的二分之一强。从发展的方向上来看，今后还需要加强与基层社、邻区社以及国营贸易机关的联系，使一切农工产品的交易经过合作社的合同经营方式，组成供销网，才能减少中间剥削，有计划地发展城乡贸易。
    各地合作社所以广泛地采用了合同制，是因为革命形势大发展后工作中心由乡村转入城市，国家商业的经营方式需要一个转变——由分散的简单的经营方式，转变为科学的有计划有组织的经营方式。实行合同制度正是促进这一发展的重要方法。根据半年来各地合作社实行的情形，大体上都或多或少地发生了这样的作用。
    采用合同制的好处  克服城乡交流中的盲目性·免除中间剥削组织与扶助小生产者·减少人力物力浪费
    合作社采用合同制的好处，首先表现在组织群众有计划地进行城乡物资交流，克服城乡交换的盲目性，缩短工农产品在市场上的供销过程，减少城乡市场上的无政府现象。如山西潞城乌里后村社，经过二十四次交换合同，供给社员必需品总值折合小米四十八万斤，推销工业原料总值折合小米二十九万斤。
    其次，合同制使国家商业在市场上构成零售采购网，直接供销工农产品，免除商人中间剥削，刺激群众生产的积极性，帮助国家经济的发展。如北京市供销总社去年十二月初，有计划地推销了农民的草绳一千八百盘（一盘五丈），按期供给了国营工厂的需要，免除了商人中间剥削，又保证了双方生产的利益和计划性，一盘麻绳，现在只需六斤米，过去就得十斤。如果用过去投标的办法，大商人控制了小生产者，国家企业和小生产者都很吃亏。
    第三，合同制对于扶助和组织小手工业生产也有很大作用。如察哈尔万全县私营铁炉业，在未订合同前，多数散漫无组织，生产亦无计划性，为了赚钱，镰刀多是劣等货，价格贵，销路少。自与合作社订合同后，按一定的规格大量制造，每把镰刀的成本由十二斤米降低到六斤米，合作社便以六斤半米的价格大批订制。这不仅大量供给了农民的需要，并且帮助解决了镰刀的销路问题，保证了手工业者合理的利润，使其得到正当的发展。这样就把这些散漫的小生产者，经过合同组织起来了。
    此外，采用合同制还减少了人力物力的浪费。如运输合同的运用，就避免了许多人畜力的徒劳往返。并可避免偷盗、掺假与捣换。
    大力提倡合作社合同制，是我们在经济上重要工作之一。
