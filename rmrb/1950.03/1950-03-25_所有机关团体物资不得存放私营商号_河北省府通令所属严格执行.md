　　All Supplies of Government Agencies and Organizations Must Not Be Stored in Private Businesses
    Hebei Provincial Government Issues Order to Subordinates for Strict Implementation
    [Reported by this newspaper from Baoding] To prevent private merchants from using public funds for speculation, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has notified all subordinate agencies and organizations that they are no longer allowed to store supplies with private merchants. Many government agencies, organizations, and schools in Hebei Province and Baoding City had previously stored large quantities of grain with private merchants, resulting in private merchants using public grain for speculation and profiteering, disrupting the market, and even allowing private merchants to squander it at will. According to an inspection on February 10, 75 units of provincial and municipal agencies, troops, organizations, and schools had 2,662,591 *jin* of grain stored, sold on consignment, or processed in 12 private electric mill businesses and 18 grain storehouses. As a result, Li Dahai, manager of Hou Chang Heng Electric Mill in Baoding, was able to use public grain to open a weaving factory, support a bathhouse and an electric grain store for a long time, and even planned to open an electrical supply store. He himself indulged in lavish eating and drinking with a mistress, resulting in significant losses and inability to repay the public grain. Fearing punishment, he fled but has been captured and handed over to the court for legal action. Mao Ji Grain Store, which was selling public grain on consignment, failed to fulfill its contract and secretly sold grain, attempting to speculate and disrupt the market. The provincial government's notice emphasized that the main reason for the above serious situation was that the units were politically negligent, only considering storage convenience, regardless of the consequences, and failing to conduct timely inspections and withdrawals. The above phenomenon must be strictly inspected, and the situation clarified for proper handling. The notice also stipulates that from now on, all government agencies and organizations are strictly prohibited from storing supplies with private merchants. Grain companies should strengthen inspections of entrusted consignment stores, and grain processing must be settled in a timely manner to ensure both supply solutions and no loss of public assets.

　　所有机关团体物资不得存放私营商号
    河北省府通令所属严格执行
    【本报讯】保定消息：河北省人民政府为防止私商利用公家粮款进行投机，已通知所属各机关、团体，今后不准再向私商存放物资。河北省及保定市好多机关、团体、学校，曾有在私商处大量存放粮食，致造成私商利用公家粮食，投机倒把，扰乱市场，甚至供私商任意挥霍。据二月十日检查，省、市机关、部队、团体、学校七十五个单位，在十二户私营电磨业、十八户粮栈业存粮、代售及加工粮等即达二百六十六万二千五百九十一斤。因此，保定电磨业厚昌恒经理李大海，竟得利用公家粮食开一织布工厂，长期支持一澡塘和一电粮行，还计划开设一座电料行；他本人则姘靠女人大吃大喝，以致亏累很多，无法偿还公家粮食，畏罪潜逃，已被抓回交法院依法惩办。茂记粮栈，代售公家粮食，不履行合同并偷卖粮食，图在市场投机倒把，扰乱市场。省府通知中着重指出：造成以上严重情况的主要原因，是各单位政治上麻痹大意，只顾存放便利，不管会造成什么恶果，没注意及时检查和提取。对以上现象必须严格检查，弄清情况加以处理。该通知并规定今后一切机关、团体一律不得在私商户存放物资。粮食公司对委托之代售店应加强检查，粮食加工必须及时清算，以便作到既解决供给，又不使公家资财受到损失。
