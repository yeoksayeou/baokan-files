　　Indonesian Authorities' "Freedom"!
    Cochran Orders Sukarno to Sabotage Soviet-Indonesian Diplomatic Relations
    [Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, March 21st dispatch] TASS, The Hague, 19th: The Information Department of the Republic of Indonesia recently issued a statement saying that the American Ambassador to Indonesia, Cochran, had recently visited President Sukarno to discuss the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. Now, the department suddenly points out that Cochran did not visit Sukarno. The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth" wrote on this matter: The United States hopes to keep secret the fact that Cochran ordered the Indonesian authorities to sabotage diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. According to press sources, Cochran was very angry that the Indonesian Information Department had leaked to the press his attempt to undermine relations between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Indonesia. Therefore, under Cochran's pressure, the Indonesian Information Department hurriedly came forward to deny the news it had previously published.
    According to Antara News Agency, Jakarta, the American Ambassador to Indonesia, Cochran, met with Sukarno on the morning of the 15th. The agency also quoted so-called well-informed sources as saying that the meeting was held because the Soviet Union's recognition of Indonesia "came suddenly."

　　印尼当局的“自由”！
    柯契伦给苏加诺下命令破坏苏联印尼外交关系
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社海牙十九日讯：印尼合众国宣传部最近曾发布文告称，美国驻印尼大使柯契伦最近曾访问苏加诺总统，商讨苏联与印尼间之外交关系问题。现在该部忽又指出柯契伦并未访问过苏加诺。荷共《真理报》特就此事写道：美国希望对柯契伦命令印尼当局破坏苏联和印尼外交关系一事，保持秘密。据新闻界人士称：柯契伦对于印尼宣传部向报界泄露他企图破坏苏联和印尼合众国间的关系的行为，甚为愤怒。因此，在柯契伦的压力下，印尼宣传部急忙出面否认该部以前发表过的消息。
    按据安尼塔社雅加达消息，美驻印尼大使柯契伦系于十五日晨会见苏加诺。该社并引所谓消息灵通人士称：这次会谈的举行，是因为苏联对印尼的承认“来得突然”。
