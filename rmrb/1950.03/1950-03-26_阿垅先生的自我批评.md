Mr. A Long's Self-Criticism
    Editor's Note: Issues 39 and 40 of this publication featured Chen Yong's "On the Relationship Between Politics and Literature" and Shi Du's "Opposing the Distortion and Falsification of Marxism-Leninism," criticizing A Long's article "On Tendency" published in the first issue of "Literary Study" in Tianjin and his article "On Positive and Negative Characters" published under another pen name (Zhang Huairui) in the second issue of "Starting Point" in Shanghai. Now, Mr. A Long has written to express his acceptance of the criticism. We believe that his spirit of courageously admitting mistakes is excellent and worthy of welcome, and we believe that through such criticism and self-criticism, we will ultimately achieve unity in our literary thought. Mr. A Long's letter is published below:
   Comrade Editor:
    "On Tendency" and "On Positive and Negative Characters" were both written by me. I have also seen the two criticisms. This makes me feel pained. I must conduct a good self-examination and fully accept the accusations.
    For me personally, I made a particularly serious mistake in the area of citations. I should bear full responsibility. Because, from my own perspective, this is no longer a matter of ideology or theory, but an unforgivable and inexplicable political matter!
    First of all, the process was as follows: I am poor and cannot fully obtain the books I need. Therefore, I have several notebooks in which I write down sentences worth studying and thinking about when I borrow books. I have been doing this for several years. I originally thought that "Scientific Art Theory" was an educational book, especially for people studying literature. I valued this book, but I didn't have it on hand, especially since I was wanted before liberation, and my life was unstable, so I couldn't carry books, and I could only use manuscript copies. After liberation, I searched all the bookstores in Hangzhou, but I couldn't buy it; when I passed through Shanghai, I also looked for it, but I still couldn't buy it; I also asked some friends to pay attention and buy it for me. Some comrades know about this. The article was written in Shanghai last September. When I wrote it, I relied on the incomplete manuscript copy I had, and I made this big mistake. In any case, the responsibility is mine.
    Secondly, I do not have a deep understanding of the new situation, and the questions I raised were not comprehensive, and the analysis was insufficient. Of course, this is also my own responsibility.
    Thirdly, this is how I understood that quotation: when it comes to "private life," I mistakenly thought that it was talking about one aspect of the characters' lives, and that their life content should be written about; when it comes to "and all the people of all kinds and colors around them," I misunderstood that what was reflected was social content, that is, what was reflected was the relationship, entanglement, contact, conflict, and contradiction between people. Moreover, I also misunderstood the phrase "show us." - only then did I come to this erroneous conclusion.
    Finally, for more than ten years, under the rule of the Kuomintang, first, I did not receive the education of the Party; second, the positions were scattered and isolated; third, I was not well educated and was completely self-taught, so that I could not go deep in many places, and this caused this great mistake.
    The mistake is mine, please criticize me more and give me help, sincerely!
    Sincerely, with revolutionary salute,
                                 A Long   March 21

　　阿垅先生的自我批评
    编者按：本刊在三十九期与四十期上，发表了陈涌的《论政治与文艺的关系》及史笃的《反对歪曲和伪造马列主义》，批评了阿垅在天津出版的《文艺学习》第一期上发表的《论倾向性》一文及他用另一笔名（张怀瑞）在上海出版的《起点》第二期上发表的《论正面人物与反面人物》一文。现在阿垅先生来信表示接受批评。我们认为他的这种勇于承认错误的精神是很好的，值得欢迎的，并且相信，经过这种批评与自我批评，我们在文艺思想上将最后达到一致。兹将阿垅先生的来信发表如下：
   编者同志：
    《论倾向性》和《论正面人物和反面人物》，都是我写的。两篇批评也看到的。这使我痛苦。我要好好进行检讨，和完全接受指责。
    对于我个人，特别犯了严重的错误，是引文的方面。我应该负担全部责任。因为，从我自己看，这已经不是一个思想问题或者理论问题，而是一个不可饶恕和不可解释的政治问题了！
    首先，经过是这样的：我贫乏，不能够完全得到所要的书籍。因此，我有几个笔记本，借书看的时候，就把值得研究和思考的文句摘录在上面，我这样做了几年。《科学的艺术论》，我原来认为是一本有教育意义的书，对于学习文学的人更是如此。我重视这本书，但是我自己手边却没有，尤其解放前我被通缉，生活不定，不可能带书，只有利用钞本的办法。解放以后，在杭州我找遍了各书店，买不到；在经过上海的时候，也找过，还是买不到；还请托过一些友人为我留意，给我买。这事情，有的同志是知道的。文章是去年九月间在上海住的时候写的。写的时候，根据的是手边的摘录得不完全的那个钞本，就犯了这个大的错误。无论如何，责任是在我的。
    其次，对于新的情况了解不深，问题提得不全面，分析不够，这当然也是我自己应负的责任。
    再次，我是这样理解那一段引文的：说到“私生活”，我误以为那是说的人物的生活内容的一面，要写他们的生活内容的；说到“和一切形形色色跟在周围的人一起”，我误解为所反映的是社会内容，即反映了的是人与人之间的关系，纠葛，接触，冲突和矛盾的。而且，又误解了“指示给我们看”这一句话。——才得出了这一错误的结果。
    最后，十几年来，在国民党统治之下，第一、我受不到党的教育；第二、阵地是分散的，孤立的；第三、我没有好好受过教育，完全是自学的，这样，使我在许多地方不能够深入，而造成了这一次大的错误。
    错误在我，请多批评，给我帮助，真诚地！
    此致革命敬礼
                                 阿垅   三月二十一日
