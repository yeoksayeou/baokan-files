　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Beijing Telegraph Office
    Promotes "100 Accident-Free Telegrams" Campaign
    Accident Rate Reduced from 14 to 4 Per Day
    [Our Dispatch] Since the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Tianjin Railway Bureau launched the "100 Accident-Free Telegrams" campaign on February 25th, the number of telegram accidents has decreased from 14 per day to 4 by March 7th. The time it takes for a telegram to be processed (from when it is copied from the telegraph machine to when it is retransmitted and delivered) has been halved compared to January. On average, it now only takes 24 minutes (compared to 52 minutes in January) to retransmit or deliver each telegram, ensuring speed and accuracy. Since the implementation of the "Contract Responsibility System by Station" and "Apprentice Groups" in December of last year, the telegram processing time in February was reduced to 35 minutes. However, because leading cadres failed to supervise and inspect in a timely manner, the number of inquiries and error corrections actually increased, affecting the overall telegram speed. This time, the administration learned from the previous experience, and after everyone discussed it, it was decided to launch the "100 Accident-Free Telegrams" campaign (100 accident-free telegrams is one period; a continuous ten periods or intermittent fifteen periods will be recorded as a merit). Results are announced every three days. In the first ten days of the campaign, 36 people completed one period, 20 people completed two periods, 8 people completed three periods, and 2 people completed four periods of accident-free telegrams. The campaign is still ongoing.

　　天津铁路局京电报所
    推行“一百封无事故”运动
    事故量已由过去每日十四件减少到四件
    【本报讯】天津铁路局北京电报所从二月二十五日推行“一百封无事故”运动以来，到三月七日止，电报事故量由每天十四件减少到四件；电报的经过时分（由电报机上抄下来，到转拍、配送所需的时间），比一月份缩短一半，平均每封电报只用二十四分钟（一月份是五十二分）就能转拍，或交给收报人，并保证了迅速、正确。该所自去年十二月进行“包台负责制”、“师徒组”等工作以来，二月份电报经过时分曾减少到三十五分钟，但因领导干部未能及时督促、检查，问报、改错的事故量反而超出，影响了全面的电报速率。此次行政上接受了上次的经验，并经过大家商讨，决定推行“一百封无事故”运动（以一百封无事故为一期，连续十期或断续十五期时记一功），成绩每隔三天公布一次。在运动的第一旬就有三十六人完成一期，二十人完成二期，八人完成三期，二人完成四期无事故。运动仍继续开展中。
