　　On the Thought of "Li Shanshang"
　　Reading Chen XueZhao's "Working is Beautiful"
　　Ya Qun

　　Li Shanshang is the heroine in Chen XueZhao's novel "Working is Beautiful." She was born into a declining feudal family in Haining City, Zhejiang, and grew up in the May Fourth era, studying in Paris. She accepted the liberal ideas of pursuing individual liberation, and also retained the kindness, nobility, tenderness, and melancholy of feudal gentlemen and ladies, as well as the lifestyle of the parasitic class—not being good at managing daily life, and even taking pride in it.

　　Thus, although she experienced the Great Revolution, the September 18th Incident, and the July 7th Incident—these major historical events—and twice went to Yan'an out of patriotic fervor and dissatisfaction with the Kuomintang rule, received education in the rectification movement for reforming intellectuals, and worked with the army, arriving in Harbin in 1946, according to the scope expressed in this novel, she ultimately failed to break free from her old thoughts and feelings and truly unite with the working people.

　　In the rectification movement, although she also made a self-criticism that was almost profound, it was only some abstract words and did not transform her. The proof is a letter she wrote to her old friend De Wei, who was still in Paris, on "June 10, 1946," after she arrived in Harbin. This letter fully demonstrates that she was still very attached to everything from her past. That is to say, her feelings were still returning to the road of her old home, instead of rushing towards the people.

　　Why did De Wei and Ming Chun, these two students studying abroad—old friends of Li Shanshang—deserve her sincere admiration and love back then? And why do they still deserve her deep remembrance now? The question is simple:

　　De Wei and Ming Chun, similarly, were born into prestigious feudal families and were similarly baptized by capitalist "civilization." Like Li Shanshang, they also retained the "noble" and "serious" qualities of their class. They shared similar tastes, so they formed a "noble" friendship with her at that time. In the more than ten years after Li Shanshang returned to China, the motherland suffered unparalleled disasters. The people of the motherland were fighting fiercely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for the independence and freedom of the motherland and their own liberation. And what about these two "noble" students studying abroad? "Ming Chun ran to Switzerland after the fall of Paris, where his life and mood were not good" and died; De Wei is said to have had "inventions" and "achievements."

　　A revolutionary intellectual who has truly abandoned the thoughts and feelings of his own class and united with the working people would not use such an attitude to cherish and praise such old friends. The correct attitude is to use the old friendship to jointly criticize the past wrong path and draw him to the people's side to serve the people. However, Li Shanshang only "respected" and "congratulated" his "achievements" unconditionally!

　　Is this so-called "achievement" De Wei's personal "achievement"? Or an achievement beneficial to the people of the motherland? The book does not explain. As for herself, she said, "The years have been wasted, and nothing has been accomplished." This deeply divided herself from the people's revolutionary cause and returned to the old nest of individualism. In short, although she wrote words like "On the road of truth, we will always be close companions walking together," she did not deny the past, but cherished it.

　　Reading this book, we should clearly recognize that Li Shanshang still retains a strong liberal thought, and is still far from a thorough transformation, with only a slight beginning. We must be seriously vigilant and not mistakenly think that someone like Li Shanshang is considered transformed.

　　谈“李珊裳”的思想
    读陈学昭著“工作着是美丽的”
    亚群
    李珊裳是陈学昭同志著的“工作着是美丽的”小说中的女主人翁。她出身于浙江海宁城内一个没落期的封建家庭，成长在五四时代，留学巴黎。她接受了追求个性解放的自由主义的思想，也保留着封建的绅士淑女的仁慈、高洁、柔情、幽思，以及寄生阶级的生活习惯——不善于管理日常生活，而且以此自豪。
    这样，她虽经历了大革命、九一八、七七，这些历史大事变，而且在爱国热忱和对国民党统治不满的情绪下，两次到延安，受过改造知识分子的整风运动的教育，并随军工作，于一九四六年到了哈尔滨，但按照这部小说所表现的范围来说，她终未能摆脱旧的思想感情，而真正与劳动人民结合。
    她在整风运动中，虽是也作了近于深刻的自我检讨，但那只是一些抽象的词句，并没有改造过来。证明是她到了哈尔滨后，“一九四六年六月十日”给她的还留在巴黎的老朋友——德伟的一封信。这信充分地说明了她还十分留恋自己过去的一切。也即是说，她的感情仍然回向老家的道路，而不是奔赴人民这一方面。
    德伟，明纯这两位留学生——李珊裳的旧友，在当年为什么值得她那样由衷的崇敬、热爱？又为什么现在还值得她那样一往情深地怀念呢？问题很简单：
    德伟、明纯，同样是出身于封建的有名望之家，也同样受了资本主义的“文明”的洗礼。他们和李珊裳一样，还保留着本阶级的“高洁”“严肃”的品质。气味相投，所以在当时，他们和她之间结下了“高贵”的友爱。在李珊裳回国后的十几年中，祖国是受着无比的灾难。祖国的人民是在中国共产党领导下为祖国的独立自由和自身的解放而如火如荼地斗争着。而这两位“高贵”的留学生呢，“明纯在巴黎沦陷之后，跑到瑞士，在那里生活和心情都不好”而死去；德伟则据说有了“发明”和“成就”。
    一个真正抛掉了本阶级的思想感情，与劳动人民结合了的革命知识分子，对这样的老朋友，是不会用这样的态度来留恋与歌颂的。正确的态度是借旧日的友情而共同批判过去错误的道路，援引他到人民这方面来为人民服务。然而李珊裳却仅仅是无条件地“尊敬”而“祝贺”他的“成就”！
    这所谓“成就”，是德伟个人的“成就”呢？还是有益于祖国人民的成就呢？书中没有说明。而述说到她自己，则是“岁月蹉跎，一事无成”。这就把自己和人民革命事业深深地划了一道鸿沟，仍然回到个人主义的老窠里了。总之，她虽是写出了“在真理的路上，我们将永远是紧紧走在一道的同伴”一类的词句，但她对过去不是否定的，而是怀恋的。
    读这本书，我们应当清醒地认识：李珊裳这个人还保留着浓厚的自由主义思想，距离彻底的改造还很远，仅仅有了些微的开端。我们要严肃地警惕，不要误以为像李珊裳那样就算改造了。
