Reader's Letter

To the Editors:

    In your newspaper's February 26th edition, page 2, Mr. Gao Wenbin provided many valuable suggestions on grain storage; and the short commentary "Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Grain Storage" also put forward a very good call to action on this matter. At the same time, the news was published that the Hebei Grain Bureau's inspection of wheat warehouses revealed that more than 120,000 jin of grain had already been lost. I believe these are all articles that are highly relevant to current problems. Therefore, I suggest that the departments responsible under the Central People's Government and the relevant agencies in various localities intensify the inspection of grain depots in various places, and designate personnel related to this business to conscientiously study the articles published in your newspaper on February 26th and implement them according to specific conditions.

    Secondly, I suggest that the responsible departments give appropriate punishment to such derelict personnel as a warning, and I hope that correspondents in various places will report more such news. With respectful greetings.

　　读者投书编辑同志：
    贵报二月二十六日第二版高文彬先生对粮食保管提供了不少宝贵意见；而短评“认真作好粮食保管工作”也对此提出很好的号召。同时，并发表河北粮食局检查麦库，发现已损失之粮食即达十二万余斤的消息。我认为这都是切中时弊的文章，因此，建议中央人民政府负责部门和各地有关机关加紧检查各地粮库，并指定这一业务有关的人员，切实学习二月二十六日贵报所登的文章，根据具体条件贯彻执行。
    其次，建议负责部门对此类失职人员给以适当的处分，以资警惕，并希望各地通讯员多报导此类消息。致敬礼
