　　The Root Causes and Lessons of Comrades Gao Zhaoging and Cui Daosheng's Errors

　　Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng are veteran cadres who joined the People's Liberation Army in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. For more than a decade, they were situated in dispersed rural environments. Since entering the city, although they have maintained a style of hard work and simplicity, they have brought the simple methods of completing military tasks during the war into the factory. They have shown resistance to implementing democratic management in the factory; they don't know how to rely on the workers, and are accustomed to solving problems with simple administrative orders. Because they themselves do not study or progress, they have long developed a style of warlordism that is divorced from the masses. They despise laws and discipline, and even consider the major issue of infringing on human rights, such as "searching and detaining workers," as nothing. As Gao Zhaoqing said in his own self-criticism: carrying the burden of being an "old revolutionary," and being complacent, they don't use their brains enough when encountering problems; in the new situation, they don't deeply analyze and study the new work environment, nor do they deeply involve and rely on the masses, which led to serious errors. The result of the development of this ideology and style of work is that they neither relied on the working class to improve production leadership and improve production quality, nor did they correctly unite the factory's technical personnel. This caused them to become isolated, high above, and overriding everything. They forgot the fundamental position of the Party and the class, forgot the love and care that a Communist Party member should have for class brothers and the masses of the people, and also forgot that a citizen who is a Communist Party member should abide by the laws of the People's Government and be a model of being honest and law-abiding, and should not act recklessly like they did.

　　During the investigation of this incident, *Party Life* discovered that some people actually treated it as a "minor matter," as if it were insignificant! We feel that this is completely wrong. The errors committed by Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng are errors of principle, and not at all a minor matter! It should deeply arouse the vigilance of the Party leaders of all enterprise departments! Isn't it a fact that the bureaucratic and warlord styles of work in factory management greatly hinder factory production and worker morale? Some of our Communist Party members only know how to flaunt their seniority every day, proclaiming themselves as the best in the world, but in reality, they are becoming more and more alienated from the working class, to the point of ignoring mass supervision and government laws. How serious is this kind of behavior that endangers the interests of the Party?

　　Finally, we hope that Comrades Gao and Cui will publicly conduct self-criticism in the newspaper, and ask the Party's factory branch to summarize this lesson and publish it in the newspaper as well, in order to educate Party members, awaken them, and avoid repeating this error.

### 高崔二同志错误根源及其教训

　　高崔二同志错误根源及其教训
    高兆庆、崔道生是抗日战争初期即参加了人民解放军工作的老干部，十余年来，长期处在分散的农村环境。进城以来，虽仍然保持了艰苦朴素的作风，但却将战争期间，完成军事任务的简单方式带进工厂，他们对于实行工厂民主管理表示怠工；不知道依靠工人，而习惯于以单纯的行政命令方式解决问题。由于他们自己不学习不进步长期地养成了一种脱离群众的军阀主义的作风，他藐视法纪，竟把侵犯人权的“搜查与拘禁工人”的大事，也认为不算什么。如高兆庆自己反省所说：背有“老革命”的包袱，与自满情绪，遇到问题不多用脑子考虑；在新形势下，对新的工作环境不深入分析研究，不深入群众依靠群众，以致犯了严重错误。这种思想作风发展的结果是既没有依靠了工人阶级改进生产领导和提高生产质量，又没有正确地团结工厂技术人员。使自己陷于孤立，高高在上，凌驾一切，他们忘掉了党的和阶级的根本立场，忘掉了一个共产党员对于阶级兄弟以及人民大众应有的热爱与关怀的态度。也忘掉了一个身为共产党员的公民应当恪守人民政府的法律，作奉公守法的模范，而不应当像他们这样的胡作非为。
    《党的生活》在调查这一事件中，发现竟有人把它当作“小事”来看待，似乎是无关轻重！我们觉得这是完全错误的。高兆庆、崔道生所犯的错误是原则性的错误，完全不是什么小事！应当深深地引起一切企业部门的党的领导人的警惕！工厂管理上的官僚主义军阀主义作风极大地妨碍着工厂生产和工人情绪，难道不是事实吗？我们有些共产党员只懂得天天摆老资格，自封老子天下第一，而实际上却在一天一天与工人阶级疏远，以至无视群众监督和政府法律，这是多么严重危害党的利益的大事啊？
    最后，我们希望高崔二同志公开在报纸上进行检讨，并请党的工厂支部总结这一教训同样在报纸上公布，以教育党员，清醒起来，避免重复这一错误。
