　　The Chinese Communist Party branch in Banlashan Village, Jin County, Lushun-Dalian, was established in 1947. Initially, it had only five or six party members, but now it has grown to eleven. Before going public, the branch's leadership was weak, its style undemocratic, and it engaged in paternalistic practices. Party members lacked high levels of awareness, making it difficult to implement the Party's policies among the masses. After going public, the branch was rectified, organizational life was strengthened, party members began to study basic Party knowledge, and their awareness gradually increased. In its work, the branch distinguished between enemies and friends, expanded and consolidated the Party's connection with the masses, thereby ensuring the implementation of the Party's policies in this land adjustment movement.

　　Banlashan Village is a village with a relatively high concentration of landlords and rich peasants. Although measures such as anti-traitor liquidation, distribution of official land, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and reasonable burden have been implemented over the past four years to weaken feudalism, a significant portion of the land in the village is still owned by landlords and rich peasants. Of the 277 households in the village, 21 are landlords, accounting for 35 percent of the village's land, and 28 are rich peasants, accounting for 44 percent of the village's land.

　　After the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office issued the Land Adjustment Decree on January 18 last year, the Party, government, peasants' association, and mass organizations in Banlashan Village organized a land adjustment committee and launched a fierce struggle against landlords and rich peasants. Throughout the struggle, the branch paid constant attention to the ideological state of the masses, correctly grasped the policies, and ensured that the movement avoided various deviations and proceeded smoothly.

　　At the beginning of the movement, in order to prevent landlords and rich peasants from spreading rumors and sabotage, and secretly harming livestock, the land adjustment committee established four working groups (each with two party members) to go to the homes of landlords and rich peasants to seize surplus livestock. At this time, the middle peasants became apprehensive, with some saying, "This is the end!" Some who were on their way to the mountains to deliver manure stopped what they were doing after hearing the news. Some cadres had made left-leaning errors in their past work, and this time they were afraid of being "leftist" and overdoing things, so they were timid and lacked enthusiasm in their work. In light of these circumstances, the land adjustment committee convened a mass meeting of poor, hired, and middle peasants to publicize and explain the policies, emphasizing to everyone that "we will resolutely not infringe on the interests of the middle peasants." "Poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants have all been oppressed by landlords and rich peasants in the past, not only economically but also politically. This time, everyone should unite well, struggle against the landlords and rich peasants, abolish feudal exploitation, eliminate the roots of poverty, and achieve political and economic emancipation!" After the meeting, the middle peasants were mobilized to help feed the livestock. At this time, the mood of the general middle peasants began to stabilize. They even shouted on the spot: "Okay! We can handle feeding the livestock!" They all took the initiative to take the livestock back to feed them. However, some middle peasants were still uneasy, saying: "We can feed them, as long as you don't take ours!" At this time, the branch held a meeting to emphasize to party members and cadres that they should correctly grasp the Party's policies, stand firm on the class position, explain more to the masses, and consult with the masses on everything. It also decided to commend the middle peasants who were active in feeding livestock and confiscating or requisitioning farm implements in the name of the land adjustment committee. After being commended, the middle peasants' concerns were basically dispelled, and those who had stopped delivering manure began to deliver manure again. Afterwards, the branch and the land adjustment committee held grievance meetings for poor, hired, and middle peasants to raise the class consciousness of the masses. At the meeting, the branch's organization committee member first used his own personal experience of being oppressed and exploited by the landlord class to inspire everyone to recall the pain of the past. The peasants all shed tears, and middle peasants who had suffered also came to the stage to cry about their pain. The land adjustment committee also called on the poor, hired, and middle peasants to unite and fight against the landlords and rich peasants.

　　The branch and the land adjustment committee always kept in mind to rely on the masses and grasp the policies. When registering farm implements and confiscating landlords' grain, the land adjustment committee first investigated the farm implements of landlords and rich peasants and the grain of landlords through the masses, so the cadres had a clear understanding of the situation before the work began, and it was impossible for landlords and rich peasants to hide anything. For example, the landlord Han Chengcai hid grain in a cabinet. When the cadres went to register it, they asked him where the grain was hidden. He said there was no grain and refused to hand it over. The cadres then asked him: "What's in the cabinet?" He picked up a newspaper and said: "Aren't you doing things according to the newspaper? Aren't you not allowed to search (dig)?" The cadres immediately replied: "We won't search, quickly hand over the grain, we won't confiscate anything else!" He had no choice but to hand over more than two *shi* of grain. After registering the farm implements, the masses proposed to dig up hidden wealth. A peasant surnamed Zhang said: "Why don't we dig up the hidden wealth of the landlords? That's all the blood and sweat they exploited from us!" Cang, a city dweller by birth, said: "Damn it, if we don't dig them up, how can they be poor? They have big fat pigs that can sell for tens of thousands, and they can buy mules and horses, and they have clothes and silver ingots, why don't we dig them up?" After hearing these reflections, the branch and the land adjustment committee studied the ideological state of the masses, believing that it was necessary to educate the masses to recognize the policy of land adjustment. Immediately afterwards, a mass meeting was convened to explain the harm of digging up hidden wealth and the benefits of not digging it up. The question was also raised: "What is the purpose of land reform?" to guide everyone in the discussion. During the discussion, some said: "Land reform is to make the poor and the rich equal." Some said: "Land is for the poor to turn over, not to be oppressed," and some said: "Land reform is to abolish feudal exploitation and develop production." After repeated discussions, everyone's thinking was basically clarified. For example, the poor peasant Han said: "It doesn't matter whether we dig up or not, as long as we have land, we will work hard to produce in the future, and our lives will be better."

　　When discussing the distribution of fruit, some layabouts planned to take advantage of the situation to get a piece of the pie. A few party members also expressed that they wanted to be allocated a better share. The branch immediately convened a branch meeting to criticize the party members' thoughts of self-interest, pointing out that communist party members should put personal interests behind and the interests of the masses first, and can only be lower than the masses, not higher. At the same time, it was also proposed to publicly criticize the layabouts who wanted to take advantage of the situation, explaining: "We are here to discuss and evaluate for everyone's emancipation, not to plan for personal interests first." After this education, the party members were able to grasp the principle of distributing fruit. During the evaluation, some masses proposed to evaluate the party members better, and the party members immediately explained, some said: "We should divide according to the production situation, not equally, but in a way that is conducive to production." Some said: "I will give the livestock to others, I have labor power." The masses were moved and said: "Communist party members are really great!"

### 金县半拉山村支部在土地调剂中贯彻党的政策

　　金县半拉山村支部在土地调剂中贯彻党的政策
    旅大金县二十里堡区前半拉山村中共支部，建立于一九四七年。最初只有党员五、六人，现在发展到十一名。在公开以前，支部领导力量薄弱，作风不民主，工作包办代替；党员觉悟不高。党的政策很难贯彻到群众中去。公开以后，整顿了支部，健全了组织生活，党员开始学习党的基本知识，觉悟逐渐提高。工作上分清了敌友。扩大并巩固了党与群众的联系。因之保证了党的政策在这次土地调剂运动中的贯彻。
    半拉山村是一个地主富农比较集中的村子。四年来虽经过反奸清算、分配官地、减租减息、合理负担等削弱封建的实施，但全村在部土地仍被地主富农所占有。全村二百七十七户中，地主二十一户，占全村土地百分之三十五。富农二十八户，占全村土地百分之四十四。
    去年一月十八日，旅大行署颁布了土地调剂法令后，半拉山村的党、政、农会、群众团体便组织了土地调剂委员会，向地主富农展开激烈斗争。斗争中支部时时注意群众思想情况，正确掌握政策，使运动避免了各种偏向而顺利进行。
    运动开始，为了防止地主富农造谣破坏，暗害牲口，土地调剂委员会成立了四个工作组（每组有党员二名参加），分头到地主富农家里牵出多余的牲口。这时中农便恐慌起来，有的说：“这回完啦”！有的正向山上送粪，听到消息后粪也不拉了。干部们有的过去在工作中曾犯过些左倾错误，这次便又怕“左”怕过火，因之工作中小手小脚劲头不大。土地调剂委员会根据这些情况，召开了贫、雇、中农的群众大会，宣传解释政策，着重向大家说明：“坚决不侵犯中农一点利益”。“贫农、雇农和中农过去都受过地主富农们的压迫，不但经济上受剥削，政治上也受压迫。这回大伙应好好团结，向地主富农斗争，废除封建剥削，挖掉穷根，咱们大家在政治上、经济上翻身！”会后又动员中农帮助喂牲口。这时一般中农情绪便开始稳定了。当场还喊着：“好！喂牲口我们能办到！”都主动地牵牲口回去饲养。但有的中农还不大安心，说：“喂倒能喂，只要不牵我们的就行！”这时支部便开会向党员、干部着重说明，应该正确掌握党的政策，站稳阶级立场，多向群众解释，有事多和群众商量。并决定以土地调剂委员会名义表扬在喂牲口、没收或征收农具工作中积极的中农。经过表扬，中农的顾虑基本打消了，不送粪的也开始送粪了。之后，支部、土地调剂委员会又开贫、雇、中农诉苦大会，以提高群众阶级觉悟。会上，支部组织委员首先以自己亲身遭受地主阶级压迫剥削的事例来启发大家回忆过去的痛苦。农民都流起泪来，受过苦的中农也上台哭诉自己的痛苦。土地调剂委员会又号召贫、雇、中农团结起来向地主富农斗争。
    支部和土地调剂委员会时时记着依靠群众，掌握政策。在登记农具没收地主粮食时，土地调剂委员会先通过群众，调查清楚地主富农的农具和地主的粮食，因此在工作进行中干部心中先就有了数，地主富农想隐藏也不行。例如地主韩成财把粮食藏在柜子里。干部去登记时，问他粮食藏在那里。他说没有粮食，不肯缴出。干部又问他：“柜子里装的什么”？他拿起报来便说：“你们不是照报上办事吗？不是不准翻（挖）吗？”干部立即回答：“我们不翻，快把粮食缴出来，别的都不没收！”他只好缴出粮食两石多。登记完农具后，群众提出要挖浮财，一个姓张的农民说：“地主的浮财为什么不挖？那都是剥削我们的血汗弄的？”城市贫民出身的苍某说：“他妈的，不挖他们，他们能穷吗？他们有大肥猪，一个能卖好几万，又能买骡、买马，又有衣服、元宝，为什么不挖？”支部与土地调剂委员会听到这些反映后，就研究群众的思想情况，认为必须教育群众认清土地调剂的政策。紧接便召开群众大会，说明挖浮财的害处和不挖的好处。并出题：“土改的目的是什么？”领导大家讨论。讨论中，有的说：“土改就是叫穷的富的均一均”。有的说：“土地就是穷人翻身，不受压迫”，有的则说：“土改是为了废除封建剥削，发展生产”。经过反复的讨论，大家的思想基本上扯通了。例如贫农韩某说：“挖不挖没有什么，只要有了地，今后努力生产，日子就会过好。”
    讨论分配果实时，有些二流子便打算乘赶浪头，捞摸一把。个别党员也表示自己要多分好一点的。支部马上召开支部会，批评党员为个人打算的思想，指出共产党员，要个人利益在后，群众利益在先，只能比群众低，不能比群众高一头。同时，对想赶浪头的二流子，又提出了要当众给以批评。说明：“我们来讨论评议是为大家翻身，不能先为个人打算”。经过这一番教育，党员们便能掌握住分配果实的原则。在评议中，有的群众提出把党员评好点，党员马上便给解释，有的说：“我们要根据生产情况分，不能平分，要有利于生产才行。”有的说：“把牲口分给别人，我有劳动力。”群众被感动的说：“共产党员真行！”
