　　Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 7th. Guangxi Province's first Financial and Economic Conference was held from February 18th to 24th. The conference discussed and approved the 1950 provincial revenue and expenditure budget and conducted a preliminary inspection of grain collection and tax revenue work. Based on Guangxi Province's current specific financial and economic situation and the task of supporting the front lines that Guangxi needs to complete, the conference stipulated that financial and economic work should ensure the completion of grain collection and tax revenue, while striving to restore and develop agricultural and industrial production, with agriculture as the mainstay, to promote economic prosperity and gradually solve and improve people's lives. The conference also reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of grain collection work in various places, and determined that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the propaganda of the reasonable burden policy, mobilize the masses, and combine it with bandit suppression, investigation of black land, and other work to complete the grain collection task in its entirety before the middle of March. In terms of taxation, the conference, in view of the fact that there is currently a lot of smuggling and tax evasion, resulting in large financial losses, stipulated that it is necessary to appropriately adjust cadres and reform old tax personnel to do a good job. Trade work should focus on the development of urban and rural trade, unite legitimate merchants and help them develop. Financial work should still focus on prohibiting the use of silver dollars and promoting the Renminbi, followed by the development of foreign exchange. The conference also discussed the promotion of Victory Bonds, spring plowing, and disaster relief work.
