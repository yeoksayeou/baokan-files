Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th - The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has issued instructions on land reform and public grain collection in newly liberated areas. The full text is as follows:

            Part One

    1. All newly liberated areas in East China, Central China, South China, Northwest China, and Southwest China have not yet reached the necessary level of preparation, awareness, and organization among the masses. It has been decided that land distribution reform will not be implemented before the autumn harvest of 1950. After the autumn harvest of 1950, in the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Shaanxi, and in the Han Chinese areas of the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, land distribution reform may be initiated by the respective provincial people's governments in areas where sufficient preparation has been made and the awareness and organization of the masses have reached the necessary level. In the aforementioned provinces, if some areas are still insufficiently prepared, the awareness and organization of the masses are still inadequate, or if there is bandit activity, the respective provincial people's governments may decide not to implement land distribution reform after the autumn harvest of 1950, but to implement it after the autumn harvest of 1951.

    2. In the six provinces of Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xikang, and Suiyuan, it has been decided that land distribution reform will not be implemented before the autumn harvest of 1951. After the autumn harvest of 1951, the respective provincial people's governments will decide whether to implement land distribution reform.

    3. In Xinjiang and all areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, as well as areas where ethnic minorities and Han Chinese live together, it has been decided that land distribution reform will not be implemented before the autumn harvest of 1951. Whether to implement land distribution reform after the autumn harvest of 1951 will be decided separately.

            Part Two

    4. In all newly liberated areas, before the implementation of land distribution, rent reduction should be implemented uniformly. Rent reduction orders and regulations will be issued by the respective provincial people's governments. Before the implementation of land distribution, it is still legal for landlords to collect rent from farmers after implementing rent reduction according to law, and farmers should still pay rent to landlords, and the land of the landlords still belongs to the landlords. However, landlords must not sell their land or disperse the land through means such as mortgages, pledges, or gifts. After the local liberation, any land sold or dispersed by landlords in the aforementioned ways should be declared invalid. However, land transactions between farmers are not prohibited. The original land of middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired laborers, whether now or in the future, belongs to the original farmers and will not be confiscated or distributed.

    5. Abandoning land is not permitted, and local people's governments should guarantee the right to harvest for all those who cultivate the land. If there are those who abandon land, the people's government may impose sanctions and may designate someone to cultivate the abandoned land, guaranteeing their harvest. Land belonging to fugitive landlords, land confiscated from local bullies, and land that is not managed will be managed by the local people's government and cultivated by the farmers who originally cultivated it.

    6. Before the implementation of land distribution, local people's governments should prohibit all destructive acts, such as slaughtering draft animals, destroying farm implements, and felling trees. Those who are indeed guilty of these destructive acts should be severely punished according to law.

            Part Three

    7. Currently, in some areas of the newly liberated areas, landlords have already reduced rent, while in other areas, landlords have not yet reduced rent, and in still other areas, farmers simply do not pay rent to landlords, and landlords do not dare to collect rent. Due to these circumstances, and due to the heavy grain requisition task in the recent new area, and shortcomings in the grain requisition method, there are phenomena of uneven and excessive burdens, so many serious problems have occurred in grain requisition. For example, some landlords have to pay more than 80% of their total income as public grain, and some landlords have to pay all of their grain income as public grain, or even pay all of it and still not have enough. This is a shortcoming and an error. These shortcomings and errors must be corrected and remedied. Otherwise, it will disrupt the steps of the people's government's rural policy, and make the people's government's announcement that it will not implement land distribution before the autumn harvest of 1950 but only implement rent reduction policy become meaningless to some extent in practice. At the same time, it also affects the government's grain requisition task which has not been completed or fully completed in some areas. In order to correct these shortcomings and errors, and in order to complete the grain requisition task, the following items are specifically decided:

    A. The public grain collected by the Central People's Government in the new area shall not exceed 17% of the total agricultural income. The local people's government's additional public grain shall not exceed 15% of the regular grain, that is, if the state collects 100 shi of public grain, the local additional public grain shall not exceed 15 shi. Local people's governments that have increased local public grain should correct it, and those that exceed it should be appropriately reduced to 15%. After the public grain task is allocated to various places, a detailed on-site inspection should be carried out. If it is indeed found that the allocation is too heavy, it should be appropriately reduced.

    B. The amount of public grain to be collected should be determined according to each household's actual income. The highest amount should not exceed 60% of its total agricultural income, and those with special circumstances should not exceed 80%. Those exceeding the amount should be appropriately reduced. If all have been collected, part should be returned immediately, but this does not apply to landlords who sell their income grain before the collection of public grain.

    C. The public grain collection area, that is, the burden population, should generally not be less than 90% of the rural population.

    D. If the landlord has not implemented rent reduction or has collected advance rent, the public grain to be paid for the field should be borne entirely by the landlord, and the tenant farmer should not bear it.

    E. If the landlord has implemented a 25% rent reduction, the public grain to be paid for the field, in addition to the progressive part borne by the landlord, the basic public grain part should be borne by both the landlord and the tenant farmer. Generally, it should be stipulated that the landlord and the tenant farmer each bear half. If the rent reduction exceeds 25% or is less than 25%, the proportion of the basic public grain borne by the landlord and the tenant farmer should also change according to the amount of rent reduction.

    F. If the landlord cannot collect any rent, or the tenant farmer does not pay any rent at all, the public grain to be paid for the field should be borne entirely by the tenant farmer, and the landlord should not bear it.

    G. According to the above provisions, the original progressive collection methods and ratios of agricultural tax stipulated in various places should be revised appropriately.

    8. Local people's governments should formulate detailed measures based on the above items, and send people to conduct on-site inspections. For households that have not collected public grain before or have collected less than the above-mentioned amounts, they should be supplemented according to their specific circumstances. For households that have collected too much public grain in the past, the amount should be reduced. For households that have collected too much public grain in the past, resulting in them being unable to make a living, part should be returned, or a receipt for advance collection should be given as the public grain collected in the summer or autumn of this year. If they are willing to use this as a purchase of public bonds, it should also be allowed.

    9. Local people's governments must carry out practical corrections and remedies for the shortcomings and errors that have occurred in grain requisition, so as to enhance the people's faith in the government and stabilize the countryside to carry out this year's spring plowing. Otherwise, this year's spring plowing will be seriously damaged.

            Part Four

    10. In order to smoothly carry out the reform of land distribution in various newly liberated areas after the autumn harvest of 1950 or after the autumn harvest of 1951, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in addition to issuing this instruction, will issue several laws and decrees on land reform. The people's governments or military and political committees of various newly liberated areas should seize the current time and, in conjunction with spring plowing production, disaster relief, and famine preparedness, quickly and intensively carry out various preparatory work. These preparatory works are: formulate specific methods for land distribution in each district based on this instruction and the Central Land Reform Law, and send capable cadres to conduct typical experiments. Train a large number of land reform cadres, quickly organize peasant associations, convene peasant representative conferences at all levels, elect peasant committees at all levels, and convene people's representative conferences at all levels, thoroughly transform the district and township political organs, and pay attention to uniting all enlightened gentry who support land reform.

    11. Those places where bandits have not yet been eliminated should quickly eliminate bandits. Those who have not yet reduced rent should immediately carry out rent reduction. If there are extremely heinous local bullies and elements who oppose the peasant movement and sabotage land reform, the provincial and county people's governments should actively and in a timely manner arrest them, send them to the people's courts or organize people's tribunals to try them according to law, and impose the punishment they deserve. There should be no negligence. For these criminals, farmers should be allowed to accuse them, but it is strictly forbidden to engage in indiscriminate beating, killing, arrest, punishment, and parading with tall hats. If the provincial and county people's governments and judicial organs cannot actively and in a timely manner arrest, try, and punish these criminals, it will be difficult to avoid these chaotic phenomena after the mass movement arises.

　　中央人民政府政务院发布
    关于新解放区土地改革及征收公粮的指示
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中央人民政府政务院顷发布关于新解放区土地改革及征收公粮的指示，全文如下：
            第一部分
    一、所有华东、华中、华南、西北、西南的新解放区，由于准备工作及群众的觉悟与组织还未达到应有的程度，决定在一九五零年秋收以前，一律不实行分配土地的改革。在一九五零年秋收以后，在江苏、浙江、安徽、福建、江西、湖北、湖南、广东、陕西九省，甘肃、宁夏、青海三省之汉人地区，凡是准备工作已经充足、群众的觉悟与组织已达应有水平之地区，由各省人民政府决定开始实行分配土地的改革。在以上各省，届时如有某些地区准备工作仍不充足，群众的觉悟与组织仍不充分，或有土匪骚扰者，亦得由各省人民政府决定在一九五零年秋收以后仍不实行分配土地的改革，待一九五一年秋收以后再实行。
    二、在广西、云南、贵州、四川、西康、绥远六省，决定在一九五一年秋收以前不实行分配土地的改革。在一九五一年秋收以后，由各省人民政府决定实行分配土地的改革。
    三、在新疆及全国各少数民族住居的地区以及少数民族与汉人杂居的地区，决定在一九五一年秋收以前均不实行分配土地的改革，在一九五一年秋收以后，是否实行分配土地的改革，另行决定。
            第二部分
    四、所有新解放区，在实行分配土地以前，应一律实行减租。减租命令及减租条例由各省人民政府发布之。在实行分配土地以前，地主依法实行减租后向农民收租，仍然是合法的，农民仍应向地主交租，而地主之土地仍归地主所有，但地主不得将自己所有的土地出卖及以典当、抵押、赠送等方式分散土地。在当地解放以后，凡地主以土地出卖及以上述方式分散土地者，均应宣布无效。但农民相互之间的土地买卖不在禁止之列，因中农、贫农、雇农原有的土地，不论现在和将来，均归原来农民所有，一律不加没收和分配。
    五、不许荒废土地，各地人民政府应保障一切耕种土地者收获的权利。如有荒废土地者，人民政府得给予处分，并得指定人去耕种无人耕种的土地，保障其收获所得。逃亡地主的土地、没收恶霸分子的土地，无人管理的土地，均由当地人民政府代管，并由原来耕种的农民耕种之。
    六、在实行分配土地以前，各地人民政府应禁止一切破坏行为，例如：宰杀耕畜、破坏农具、砍伐树木等。对于确有这些破坏行为的分子，得依法严惩之。
            第三部分
    七、目前在新解放区，有些地区的地主已经减租，另有些地区的地主尚未减租，再有些地区的农民根本不向地主交租，地主亦不敢收租。由于这些情况，以及由于最近一次新区征粮任务很重，征粮办法有缺点，有畸重畸轻现象，所以在征粮中发生了不少严重问题，例如：有些地主须以其总收入的百分之八十以上来交公粮，还有地主须以其粮食收入的全部来交公粮，或者全部交了还有不够的。这是一种缺点和错误。对于这种缺点和错误，必须纠正和补救，否则，就要紊乱人民政府农村政策的步骤，就使人民政府在一九五零年秋收以前不实行分配土地、只实行减租政策的宣布，在实际的某种程度上变为无意义的举动，同时，也影响到政府的征粮任务至今在某些地区没有完成或没有全部完成。为了纠正这些缺点和错误，并为了完成征粮任务，特决定下列各项：
    甲、中央人民政府所征收之公粮，在新区不到农业总收入的百分之十七。地方人民政府附加公粮不得超过正粮的百分之十五，即国家征收公粮一百石，地方附加公粮不得超过十五石。各地人民政府有加重地方公粮者，应予纠正，超过者，应酌减至百分之十五。公粮任务分摊至各地以后，应经过详细的实地检查，如确有分摊过重者，应适当减轻。
    乙、应按照各户实际收入规定其公粮征收额，最高者不得超过其农业总收入的百分之六十，其有特殊情形者，亦不得超过百分之八十，超过者应适当减轻。如已全部征收者，应即退还一部，但地主在征收公粮之前将自己收入之粮食卖掉者，则不在此例。
    丙、公粮征收面，即负担人口，一般不得少于农村人口的百分之九十。
    丁、地主没有实行减租或已收预租者，该田亩应缴之公粮应完全由地主负担，佃农不负担。
    戊、地主已实行二五减租者，该田亩应缴之公粮除累进部分由地主负担外，其基本公粮部分由东佃双方负担，大体上应规定为东佃各负担一半。减租超过二五或不足二五者，东佃负担基本公粮比例亦应依减租多少而改变。
    己、地主完全收不到租，或佃农完全不缴租者，该田亩应缴之公粮即完全由佃农负担，地主不负担。
    庚、根据以上各项规定，各地原来规定之农业税累进征收办法与比例，应加以必要的适当的修正。
    八、各地人民政府应根据以上各项，规定详细办法，并派人实地检查，对于以前没有征收公粮或征收不足以上规定额数之户，应视其具体情况补征之。对于征收公粮过多之户，应减征之，对于以前已征公粮过多过重致使其无法为生之户，应退还一部，或给予预征收据作为今年夏季或秋季所征之公粮。如愿以此作为购买公债者，亦应允许。
    九、各地人民政府对于自己在征粮中所发生的缺点和错误，必须如此进行切实的纠正和补救，才能增进人民对于政府之信仰，才能安定农村以进行今年的春耕，否则，今年的春耕将受到严重损害。
            第四部分
    十、为了在一九五零年秋收以后或在一九五一年秋收以后在各新解放区能够顺利地进行分配土地的改革，中央人民政府政务院除颁发本指示外，将发布关于土地改革的若干法令，各新解放区的人民政府或军政委员会应抓紧目前的时间，结合着春耕生产救灾备荒，迅速地紧张地进行各项准备工作。这些准备工作就是：根据本指示及中央土地改革的法令规定各区分配土地的具体办法，并派得力干部进行典型试验。大量地训练土地改革的干部，迅速组织农民协会，召开各级农民代表大会，选举各级农民委员会，并召开各级人民代表会议，彻底改造区乡政权机关，并注意团结一切赞成土地改革的开明士绅等。
    十一、某些地方土匪还未肃清者，应迅速肃清土匪，尚未减租者，应即进行减租。如有罪大恶极的恶霸分子及反对农民运动、破坏土地改革的分子，省县人民政府应主动地适时地加以逮捕，送交人民法院或组织人民法庭依法审判，并处以应得之罪刑，不得怠慢。对于这些犯罪分子，应允许农民控告，但必须严格禁止乱打、乱杀、乱逮捕、乱处罚及戴高帽游行等行为。如果省县人民政府和司法机关不能主动地适时地去逮捕、审判和处分这些犯罪分子，则在群众运动起来以后，就很难避免这些混乱现象的发生。
                               总理  周恩来
                                     一九五零年二月二十八日
