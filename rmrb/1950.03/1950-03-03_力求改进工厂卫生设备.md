　　Strive to Improve Factory Hygiene Facilities
    The report of the Tianjin Factory Hygiene Inspection Team has raised the urgent issue of improving factory hygiene facilities for us.

    This inspection team was jointly formed by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Tianjin China Textile Company, the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau, and the Textile Workers' Union. During their seven-day inspection, they discovered the severely poor hygienic conditions in factories and put forward specific and practical suggestions for improvement.

    The report pointed out that the current poor hygienic conditions in factories are intolerable and must be immediately improved as much as possible. In the old society, workers' so-called "occupational diseases" were once considered insurmountable. However, according to the report of the hygiene inspection team, many so-called "occupational diseases," even at present, should and can be completely avoided. For example, in the woodworking shop of the China Textile Machinery Factory, wood dust flies everywhere, making it very easy to harm workers' respiratory organs; however, if each worker had a mask, this harm could be reduced or even avoided. The addition of masks, as everyone knows, is indeed easy. Therefore, as long as the administrative and trade union leaders of the factory are determined to study improvement methods, the problem will be properly solved.

    In order to effectively improve factory hygiene conditions, each factory must appropriately expand hygiene facilities and make full use of and transform existing facilities. The inspection team's report tells us that not only are the original hygiene facilities in many factories extremely rudimentary and unable to meet the minimum hygiene needs of workers; moreover, some of the original hygiene facilities have not been improved and fully utilized. For example, the original ventilation equipment in China Textile Factory No. 6 has not been used to improve workers' health. Also, in some factories, bucket-style latrines have not been transformed to reduce or avoid drafts, which are detrimental to workers' health. In addition, we believe that the various opinions put forward by the inspection team are all urgent problems that need to be solved immediately and should all be put into action.

    At present, the improvement of factory hygiene facilities has attracted attention in various places; however, this is only the beginning, and more specific and practical work still awaits the efforts of administrative and trade union cadres in various factories. We hope that governments at all levels, relevant departments, and the administrative and trade union departments of various factories will continue to focus on the inspection of work to improve workers' hygiene conditions and continue to work hard to improve factory hygiene facilities. This work should be regarded as a regular system, persisted in, and implemented to the end.

### 力求改进工厂卫生设备

　　力求改进工厂卫生设备
    天津工厂卫生检查组的报告，向我们提出了改进工厂卫生设备的迫切问题。
    这个检查组是由中央人民政府劳动部、卫生部、纺织工业部、中华全国总工会、天津中纺公司、天津市卫生局及纺织工会联合组成的。他们在七天的检查工作中，发现了工厂卫生条件的严重恶劣情况，并提出了具体切实的改进意见。
    报告指明，目前工厂卫生条件的恶劣，是不能容忍的，必须立即加以必要与可能的改善。在旧社会里，工人的所谓“职业病”，曾经被认为是不可克服的。但是，从卫生检查组的报告来看，有许多所谓“职业病”，即使在目前，也是应该而且完全可以避免的。例如，中纺机器厂的木作间，木屑纷飞，最容易伤害工人的呼吸器官；但是每个工人只要有一个口罩，就可以减少以至于不遭受这种伤害。而口罩的添置，尽人皆知，那的确是轻而易举的。因此，只要工厂的行政与工会负责人，决心研究改进办法，问题是会得到适当解决的。
    为了切实改善工厂卫生状况，各厂必须适当扩充卫生设备，并充分利用与改造现有设备。检查组的报告告诉我们，许多工厂不但原有的卫生设备是极其简陋的，不能满足工人最低限度的卫生需要；而且，原有的一些卫生设备，也并没有加以改善和充分利用起来。例如中纺六厂原有的通风设备就未被利用来改善工人的健康。又如某些工厂中，掏粪式的便坑，亦未加以改造，使之减少或避免吹风，以致损害着工人的健康。此外，检查组所提的各项意见，我们认为都是当前迫待解决的问题，应该使之全部见诸行动。
    目前工厂卫生设备的改善，已引起各地注意；但这仅仅是个开端，更多的具体而切实的工作，还有待各厂行政与工会干部的努力。我们希望各地政府、有关部门、各厂的行政与工会方面，继续抓紧对于改善工人卫生状况的工作检查，继续努力改进工厂的卫生设备。把这一工作当成一种经常的制度，坚持下去，贯彻到底。
