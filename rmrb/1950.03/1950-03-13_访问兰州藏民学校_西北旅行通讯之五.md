Visiting the Lanzhou Tibetan School
Northwestern Travelogue, Part Five
By our reporter Li Wen

With a compassionate heart, Chairman Mao
Is like a "star in the sky."
The Communist Party is like the "heavenly scales" (Tibetan legend says the heavenly scales are the most just and impartial),
Treating Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, and Manchu people with equal fairness and kindness.
The suffering masses of the Tibetan areas, like in a sea of bitterness,
Have also received light,
Generating unprecedented joy.
　　× × × × ×

In Labrang
We Tibetan youth
All our hearts are aligned in one direction,
Coming to Lanzhou to study,
We are as happy as birds!
We must study diligently,
Learn how the Communist Party works for the people,
And return to our own regions,
To do some things for the masses.

The cuckoo's call in April,
Awakens the growth of all grasses (Tibetan legend says that when the cuckoo calls, the grass sprouts),
With a compassionate heart, Chairman Mao,
Awakens the people of the Tibetan areas.

The above is a poem spoken by Langha, a poor Tibetan from the Tibetan School (i.e., the Third Department of the Lanzhou Branch of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University), recorded in Tibetan phonetic transcription by Li Tianzhu, the director of the club, and published in both Tibetan and Chinese on the study wall newspaper. It sings praises of coming to Lanzhou to study, sings praises of the people's leader, and is filled with the joy of liberation in its language.

The Third Department of the Lanzhou Branch has a total of more than 130 students, mostly Tibetans from Labrang, Zhuoni, Qinghai and other places, as well as a small number of Mongolians and Han Chinese (lower-level cadres drawn from the People's Liberation Army) who are determined to serve the Tibetan areas. They are divided into two classes. The advanced class has more than 40 people, with a higher level of education, most of whom are proficient in both Tibetan and Chinese, including educated youth and some former military officers and former civil servants of Tibetan origin. The elementary class has more than 90 people, mostly illiterate Tibetan working people, including poor herdsmen, farmers, and working women who have never left their own tribes. The entry of these people into the school marks the beginning of social evolution in the Tibetan areas and symbolizes the bright future of the Tibetan people!

How did they come to Lanzhou from the Tibetan areas? Although there are various specific circumstances, they share a common initial understanding. They realized that "society is advancing, the days of Tibetan people rising to the top have arrived, and we must learn some skills to do things for ourselves and for everyone." Let's see how Dongbao came to the school:

Dongbao is almost thirty years old, living on the streets of Labrang, a poor man with no land or property, making a living by doing small business. When he was in his teens, the tribal "chieftain" forced him to attend the Tibetan primary school three times, but he managed to avoid it, partly because his family was poor and needed help from his father and brothers to make a living; partly because the school, although called a Tibetan primary school, was actually mostly attended by Hui and Han children, with very few Tibetan children, and the teachers mostly spoke Chinese and taught Chinese, which he could not understand and felt uninterested in. After liberation, a group of People's Liberation Army soldiers lived in Dongbao's uncle's house. At first, the uncle was frightened. He had seen the Kuomintang army ransack houses and beat and scold people for saying a wrong word. But the People's Liberation Army said kindly, "Our troops are large. Can you let us stay in your idle house?" Although there was a language barrier, they gradually became close. The People's Liberation Army was very disciplined in every move, borrowing bowls and chopsticks for meals and always returning them clean. Sometimes they even helped with chores. The old man had never seen such a good army. He thought, "If we follow these people, the children can also be well-educated." When he heard that the Revolutionary University was mobilizing Tibetan students, the old man sent his son to Lanzhou, and repeatedly urged Dongbao to come and study as well.

The first group of students to come to Lanzhou was Cai Yongzhong, Luo Chengxun and other eight Tibetan intellectuals. They told me about the preparations for the Tibetan Department of the Revolutionary University: "We have experienced the discrimination and oppression of the Kuomintang against the Tibetan people. Before the liberation of Labrang (they are from Labrang), we had seen pamphlets distributed by the Communist Party and felt that the Communist Party's policies were satisfactory, completely different from the Kuomintang. Soon, Labrang was liberated, and the People's Liberation Army sent a representative named Liu. Several of us young people contacted Representative Liu and wanted to follow the People's Liberation Army to liberate Xining. Xining was also quickly liberated, and we made up our minds to join the army and work. We went to the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army Corps in Linxia, and then followed a responsible comrade to Lanzhou. Deputy Commander Peng specially received us Tibetan youth, caring for us like a loving mother cares for her children, carefully inquiring about the pain and demands of the people in the Tibetan areas, and encouraging us, 'You group of Tibetan intellectuals have great potential. Don't rush to join the army now. Study hard for a period of time and do more for the people in the Tibetan areas in the future.' We happily accepted the instructions of Deputy Commander Peng. The eight of us, plus two students from the Department of Border Affairs of Lanzhou University, formed a research class on ethnic issues and began our studies. Later, a group of young people from Zhuoni, Labrang, Qinghai and other places came one after another. Last November, the Tibetan Department was officially established."

The leadership's emphasis on and care for Tibetan youth greatly boosted their enthusiasm for learning. For example, to take care of the Tibetan people's habit of not eating millet, the general comrades of the government and troops ate half millet and half flour, but tried their best to let the students eat white flour. Each student received "three new" cotton uniforms, shirts, trousers, socks, towels, etc. The Tibetan students from poor backgrounds were even more excited. Although they were not used to wearing uniforms for the first two days, they were much warmer and more comfortable than wearing old sheepskin coats bare. They said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, we would never be able to wear trousers in our lifetime." When the study notebooks were distributed, many students were so excited that they couldn't sleep at night, lying in bed thinking, "The notebooks have been distributed, so we must study hard." Dongbao was one of them. He was very interested in learning Tibetan. Before the wake-up call, he got up and enthusiastically practiced his homework. He wrote and recited at the same time. In just over a month, he learned the alphabet, learned phonetics, and could read Tibetan announcements. He could also write out the Buddhist scriptures he had memorized in the past. Cao Rui was a classmate who came late and Gaerma learned slowly. Dongbao enthusiastically helped them, and they also liked to study with Dongbao. Dongbao recited to himself, listening to see if they had made any mistakes, so that he could correct them in time. When Gaerma and Cao Rui learned to write Tibetan, they sent it to Dongbao to see and correct his typos. The promotion of the spirit of mutual help and love among the students made up for the uneven level and uneven progress of learning.

The most significant progress of some Tibetan students in the advanced class who had mixed in the Kuomintang army and government was that they recognized the difference between the old and new societies and began to clarify their new outlook on life. When they understood "how to be a human being," many students expressed their determination to make progress. They frankly confessed to everyone the bad habits that the old Kuomintang society had infected them with. One student even confessed that he had been a Kuomintang spy, how he had extorted money from the masses, and how he had been corrupt.

The herdsmen and farmers, who had been used to being willful and unrestrained, had various inconveniences when they first lived in a collective. Long after the lights-out whistle had blown, some students would sing when they were happy. No matter how late it was, when one person sang, many people would follow. In the classroom, while the teachers were lecturing, two or three students would whisper and play. When the morning wake-up call sounded, some students still slept in lazily. During class time, some people also sneaked out to the streets to watch the fun. The school leadership adopted a patient attitude of education and guidance towards the initial chaos, and used various methods to arouse the Tibetan students' interest in new things. They had planned to organize them to visit factories, watch movies, and participate in various mass rallies, all of which played a greater educational role. The leadership also paid attention to gradually cultivating their habits of democratic life. If you go to visit the Tibetan School today, the situation has changed greatly. After deliberation and discussion in each life group, they formulated a code of conduct, which everyone was willing to abide by. You will see that in the classroom, the students are listening attentively. As soon as the after-school time arrives, the spacious courtyard becomes lively, filled with a pleasant atmosphere everywhere. Playing basketball, playing football, and the erhu emits a melodious tune. Female students are singing and dancing.

The Tibetan students have learned self-criticism and mutual criticism. Before the lights go out every night, each group holds a criticism meeting, where everyone comments on who studied well that day and who had any shortcomings.

A pleasant democratic life, the attention and care of all parties, aroused the Tibetan students' love for the new society and new China. When the news of purchasing victory public bonds reached the school, it immediately caused a warm response. The groups successively proposed to the school: "Let's save some coal from the heating stoves for the recent month and buy public bonds." Most of the Tibetan students were poor, and they tried their best to buy a few points if they could. Tibetan women value jewelry the most, but female student Cao Rui took out her beloved two gold earrings and bought five points of public bonds - she (they), like compatriots from all over the country, were caught up in the great tide of patriotism.

　　访问兰州藏民学校
    西北旅行通讯之五
    本报记者  力文
     慈悲心肠的毛主席，
     像天上的“星宿”。
     共产党像“天上的秤”（藏民传说天上的秤最大公无私），
     汉藏蒙回满，待谁都一样公正一样好。
     苦海似的藏区众生，
     也得到了光明，
     产生了从来未有的欢喜。
      ×  ×   ×   ×  ×
     在拉卜椤地方
     我们藏族青年
     大家的心向一个方向来了，
     到兰州来学习，
     我们像鸟儿一样的快乐啊！
     要详细的学习，
     学习共产党为人民做事，
     回到自己的地方去，
    给大众做出些事情。
      ××    ×
    四月里布谷鸟的叫唤，
    唤起了万草生起（藏民传说，布谷鸟一叫，草便发芽），
    慈悲心肠的毛主席，
    唤醒了藏区的人民。
    以上是藏民学校（即西北人民革命大学兰州分校第三部）一个贫苦藏民郎哈得口讲，俱乐部主任李天柱用藏文记音，用藏汉两种文字发表在学习墙报上的一首诗。歌诵自己来兰州学习，歌诵着人民领袖，言语里洋溢着解放后的欢快。
    兰州分校第三部共一百三十多个同学，大多数是来自拉卜楞、卓尼、青海等地的藏民，和少数的蒙民及决心为藏区服务的汉民（从解放军抽调的下层干部）。共分为两个班级。高级班四十余人，文化程度较高，多数兼通藏汉两种文字，包括知识青年和一部分藏民出身的旧军官，旧公务人员。初级班九十多人，多为不识字的藏族劳动人民。有贫苦的牧民、农民，也有从来没出过本部落的劳动妇女，这批人们的走进学校，显示出藏区社会演进的开端，象征着藏区人民光明的前程！
    他们是怎样从藏区来到兰州呢？虽有各种不同的具体情况，但有着一个共同的初步认识。他们意识到：“社会在前进了，藏民出头的日子到了，要学些为自己为大家办事的本领”。且看董保怎样来到学校吧：
    董保快三十岁了，家居拉卜楞街道上，是个没土地没房产的穷人，靠着做小生意为生。当他十几岁的时候，部落“头人”曾三次强制他入藏民小学，他都设法逃避了，一半是由于家中穷苦，需要帮助父兄做些生计；一半是因为名为藏民小学的学校，实际上绝大多数是回汉子弟，有很少几个藏民儿童，教员又多半是讲汉话、教汉文，他听不懂，感到没兴趣。解放后，董保的舅舅家里，住了一班解放军。开初舅舅吓坏了，他见过国民党的军队到家中便是翻箱倒柜，一句话说不对，便动手打骂。可是解放军却和蔼可亲的说：“我们来的队伍多，老大爷的闲房子，能让我们住一下吗？”虽然语言有隔阂，却仍然渐渐的亲热起来了。解放军一举一动都很规矩，借碗筷吃饭，送还时总是刷得干干净净，有时还帮助做些杂活。老汉从来没见过这样好的军队啊，他想“跟着这些人，孩子们也能教养好”。当听到革命大学动员藏民学生的时候，老汉便打发自己的儿子到兰州来了，同时还再三劝董保也来学习。
    来兰州最早的一批同学是蔡永中、罗成勋等八个藏族知识青年。他们告诉我革大藏民部筹建的经过：国民党对藏民的歧视与压迫我们尝受过了，还在拉卜楞（他们是拉卜楞人）解放前，曾见到过共产党印发的小册子，感到共产党的政策令人满意，和国民党完全两样。不久，拉卜楞解放了，解放军派来一位姓刘的代表，我们几个青年和刘代表接洽，曾想随解放军去解放西宁。西宁也很快解放了，我们便下了参军工作的决心，到临夏找到解放军的兵团司令部，后又随某负责同志来到兰州。彭副总司令特地接待我们几位藏族青年，像慈母关心自己子弟一样的关照我们，仔细的询问着藏区人民的痛苦和要求，勉励我们说：“你们这批藏民知识青年很有前途，现下不忙于参军，好好学习一个时期，将来为藏区人民多做些事情”。我们高兴的接受彭副总司令的指示，我们八个再加上兰州大学边疆系的两位同学，组成了民族问题研究班，开始了学习。后来，卓尼、拉卜楞、青海等地又陆续来了一批青年，去年十一月，藏民部便正式建立了。
    领导上对藏民青年的重视和关怀，大大的鼓舞了他们的学习情绪。比如为照顾藏民不吃小米的习惯，机关部队的一般同志是半米半面，却尽量让同学们吃白面，每个同学都发了“三面新”的棉制服、衬衣、衬裤、鞋袜、毛巾等等。穷苦出身的藏民同学更格外兴奋。穿制服的头两天虽有些不习惯，比起光着身子穿老羊皮袄，温暖舒适得多。他们说：“不是共产党咱一辈子也穿不上裤子啊”。发了学习本子的时候，不少同学兴奋的晚上睡不着觉，躺在床上想“本子发了，可要好好的学习”。董保便是其中的一个，他学藏文的兴趣很大，起床哨子没吹，他便起来了，热情的练习功课。一面写一面念，一个多月他学会了字母，学会了拼音，读下来藏文布告。过去念会的佛经，也能用文字写出了。曹瑞是来得晚的一位同学尕而麻学得慢，董保热心帮助他们，他俩也爱和董保在一块学习。董保一面自己念，一面听着他俩是否有念错的地方，以便及时纠正。尕而麻曹瑞学写藏文，便送给董保去看，给他改错字。同学们友爱互助精神的发扬，弥补着程度不齐、进步不一的学习情况。
    高级班里某些在国民党军队和机关里混过的藏民同学，最显著的进步是认识了新旧社会的不同，开始明确新的人生观。当他们明白“应该怎样做人”的时候，有不少同学表示了进步的决心。他们向大家坦白说出国民党旧社会传染给他们的恶习。有一个同学曾检讨出，他当过国民党的谍报员，怎样敲诈群众，贪污腐化。
    任性放荡惯了的牧民、农民们，初次过集体生活，曾有过各方面的不习惯。熄灯哨子吹过好久了，有的同学高兴起来便唱歌。不论深更半夜，一个人唱便有许多人跟着唱起来。在课堂上，教员在讲课，两三个同学便交头接耳的闹着玩了。早上起床哨吹了，有的同学还任性的在睡懒觉。在上课的时间里，也有人悄悄溜到街上看热闹去了。学校领导上，对初期的紊乱情况，采取了耐心的教育和引导的态度，采用各种方法，引起藏民同学对新事物的兴趣。曾有计划的组织他们参观工厂，看电影，参加各种群众集会，均起到较大的教育作用。领导并注意到慢慢的培养他们民主生活的习惯。如果今天去藏民学校参观，情况已发生大大变化了。他们经过各生活小组的酝酿讨论，制订出生活公约，大家动手订出的，大家乐意遵守。你会看见在课堂上，同学们一个个在用心的听讲。课外时间一到，宽大的院落里便热闹起来了，到处充满着愉快的空气，玩篮球的、踢足球的、胡琴发出悠扬的音调。女同学在歌唱着跳舞着。
    藏民同学们学会了自我检讨和互相批评。每晚熄灯前各小组开检讨会，大家来评论，一天中谁的学习好，谁有了啥缺点。
    愉快的民主生活，各方的重视和爱护，引起藏民同学们对新社会新中国的爱戴。当认购胜利公债的消息传到学校的时候，即刻掀起了热烈的反映。各小组纷纷向学校提出：“最近一个月的取暖火炉节省些煤炭，买成公债吧”。藏民同学大多数是没钱的，能买几分的都尽量买了，藏族妇女最重视首饰，女同学曹瑞却把自己心爱的两个金耳坠拿出，买了五分公债——她（他）们和各地同胞一样，卷进爱国主义的大浪潮中了。
