　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 22nd: The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor held a joint meeting on the 21st with the leaders of the largest national trade union federations to discuss the situation in the country caused by the government's measures to suppress freedom. The official communique of the Executive Committee meeting stated that after listening to the report of General Secretary Vittorio, the Executive Committee unanimously approved a number of suggestions aimed at "launching a broad mass struggle throughout the country against any act that violates the constitution and the laws of the republic." The General Confederation of Labor called on all Italian working people to ensure the broadest unity of all strata of people in their struggle for freedom. The communique continued: "The government's measures are aimed at stifling freedom and openly enforcing unreasonable economic policies in the country, which guarantee huge profits for a small number of big capitalists and will lead to increased unemployment and the impoverishment of the broad masses of the people." The Executive Committee reiterated the rights of the working people and demanded that the struggle be strengthened against arbitrary layoffs and reductions in industrial production, and for economic policies that encourage and develop production in accordance with the economic plan of the General Confederation of Labor. The Executive Committee has instructed the Secretariat of the General Confederation of Labor to coordinate the struggles of the working people in various regions and provinces across the country and, if necessary, to call on all working people to hold a general strike.
