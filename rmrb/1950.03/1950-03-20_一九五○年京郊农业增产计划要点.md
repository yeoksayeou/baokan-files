[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The key points of the 1950 Agricultural Production Increase Plan for the Suburbs of Beijing, formulated by the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, are as follows:

The existing cultivated land in the suburbs of Beijing is 1,044,978 mu, with an annual total output of 154,943,030 jin. This year's plan is to increase production by 10%, which is 15,494,303 jin more millet than usual. The specific methods to increase production include water conservancy construction, increased fertilizer application, promotion of superior varieties, and intensive cultivation: 1. In terms of water conservancy construction, there are: drilling 73 artesian wells, which can expand paddy fields by 1,700 mu; digging 235 new wells, which can irrigate 3,525 mu of fields; repairing 265 old wells, which can restore 3,975 mu of irrigated land. In the 18th district, a canal will be opened using the Yongding River, with a length of 4.5 kilometers, which can increase paddy fields by 6,000 mu; in the 20th district, three branch canals will be opened using the existing rice field canals and Chenglong Canal, with a length of 10 kilometers, which can increase paddy fields by 3,800 mu; in Shijingshan in the 19th district, a water diversion dam will be built, which can increase paddy fields by 7,500 mu; and a water diversion dam will be built in Junzhuang, which can increase paddy fields by 2,000 mu. In total, various water conservancy projects can increase millet production by 1,134,375 jin, accounting for 7.3% of the total increase. In addition, it is planned to dredge 69 kilometers of rivers and canals, open 46 large and small drainage ditches, and repair 71 old ditches to ensure that 120,000 mu of fertile land is protected from floods. 2. In terms of increasing fertilizer application: strive to increase fertilizer by 10% per mu (i.e., apply 20 jin more fertilizer), which is estimated to increase millet production by 7 million jin, accounting for 45.2% of the total increase. 3. In terms of promoting superior varieties: it is planned to promote Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes, Northeast Xiaohongmang rice seeds, and Si Zi 2B cotton, which can increase millet production by 5,550,910 jin, accounting for 35.8% of the total increase. 4. In terms of intensive cultivation: it is estimated that millet production can be increased by 1,809,018 jin, accounting for 11.7% of the total increase.
