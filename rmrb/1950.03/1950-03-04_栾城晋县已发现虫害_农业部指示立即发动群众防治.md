    Insect Pests Discovered in Luancheng and Jin County
    Ministry of Agriculture Instructs Immediate Mobilization of the Masses for Prevention and Control

    [Reported by this newspaper] Insect pests have occurred in Luancheng and Jin County in Southern Hebei. The Bureau of Pest and Disease Control of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued instructions on February 25th, instructing the farms in the two counties to work with local governments to mobilize the masses for early prevention and control. On February 20th, red spiders were found in wheat fields in the suburbs of Jin County. They are very small and can only be found by squatting down and observing carefully. Based on last year's experience, these insects burrow into the soil clods under the wheat stalks at night and crawl onto the wheat seedlings after sunrise to suck their juices, causing the seedlings to gradually wither. Last year, they occurred in Ningjin, Shulu, and Shen County in Hebei Province, with Ningjin being the most severely affected. Based on last year's prevention and control experience, the following are effective and easy methods: (1) Water irrigation: Stir with a shovel during irrigation to make the water muddy, so that the insects are knocked off the wheat seedlings and killed by the muddy water. (2) More hoeing: Use a large hoe to hoe more when the frozen ground thaws, pushing and pulling repeatedly to kill most of the insects. (3) Spraying with paste water: Use millet rice porridge, noodle soup, or one catty of white flour with four or five catties of clear water to make a paste, then dilute it in sixty or seventy catties of clear water, stir thoroughly, and then spray with a sprayer. If there is no sprayer, you can use a broom or a cooking brush to sprinkle the mixture.

    In addition, in Longhua Village, Fourth District, Luancheng County, grasshoppers (nymphs) were found on February 19th on the sunny side of the grain transport river in the village. The larger ones were about three-tenths of an inch long, and the smaller ones were the size of wheat grains, black and yellow, and could jump two or three feet. After learning about this, the Xinji Farm, in addition to reporting to higher authorities, has also sent personnel to work with the county government to mobilize the masses to capture and kill them.

    The occurrence of the above two types of insect pests is the beginning of our 1950 pest control work. It is estimated that pests may still occur in other areas where they occurred last year. It is hoped that production leading departments at all levels will be highly vigilant and carry out prevention and control as early as possible to curb their development and spread.

    栾城晋县已发现虫害
    农业部指示立即发动群众防治
    【本报讯】冀南栾城、晋县发生虫害，中央人民政府农业部病虫害防治局于上月二十五日指示两县农场结合地方政府发动群众及早防治。二月二十日晋县城郊麦田发现红蜘蛛，其形很小，须蹲下仔细观察才能发现。根据去年经验，这种虫子是夜间钻在麦棵下土坷垃里，日出后爬上麦苗吸吮汁液，使麦苗逐渐枯萎。去年河北省宁晋、束鹿、深县等地都曾发生，以宁晋为最重。根据去年防治经验，有效易行的办法有下列几种：（一）用水灌浇：浇时用锹搅拌，使水混污，如此，虫子从麦苗碰落在泥水里就可沾毙。（二）多锄：冻地开化就可用大锄多锄，锄时一再推拉，可使虫子杀死大部。（三）用浆糊水喷射：小米饭米汤，煮面条的面汤，或用一斤白面，四五斤清水，打成浆糊，再稀释在六七十斤的清水里，充分搅拌，然后用喷雾器喷射，如无喷雾器，可用笤帚或炊帚沾着洒。
    另外栾城县四区龙化村在本村运粮河边向阳处于二月十九日发现蚂蚱（即蝻子），大的约三分长，小的如麦粒，黑黄色，能跳二三尺远。辛集农场得悉后，除向上级报告外，并已派员结合该县政府发动群众进行捕打。
    上述两种虫害的发生，是我们一九五○年防治虫害工作的开端，估计去年其他发生虫害地区仍有可能发生，望各级生产领导部门高度警惕，及早防治，以遏止其发展和蔓延。
