    [Beijing Municipal News Agency] In order to accelerate the work of immigration to Chahar and Suiyuan, so as to solve the livelihood problems of some pedicab workers, unemployed poor people, intellectuals, and a small number of out-of-town disaster victims before the spring plowing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided that, starting from today, in addition to continuing to mobilize pedicab workers to go to Chahar and Suiyuan to engage in agricultural production, it will also begin to handle the immigration of unemployed citizens. Any citizen who is willing to take their families to settle in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces and engage in agricultural production, as long as each household has at least one male laborer and has the skills or determination to engage in agricultural labor, can go to the district office where they live to register, and will be sent to Chahar or Suiyuan in batches before the spring plowing by government personnel. All travel expenses and food expenses during the journey will be provided by the government. After arriving at the destination, the local government will allocate land and houses, and will provide interest-free production loans of 560 catties of millet per person, including: 1. Eight months of food expenses, 30 catties of millet per person per month, totaling 240 catties. 2. Seeds and farm tools expenses, 110 catties of millet per person. 3. Livestock expenses, 190 catties of millet per person. 4. Settlement expenses, 20 catties of millet per person. It is estimated that after one year of labor and management, they will be self-sufficient in the second year (i.e., next year) and will repay one-third of the production loans to the government. The entire amount can be repaid in the third year.
