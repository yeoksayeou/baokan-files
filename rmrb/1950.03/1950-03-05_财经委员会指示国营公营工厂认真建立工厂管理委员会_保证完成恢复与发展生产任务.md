Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. Regarding the democratization of management and enterprise management in state-owned and public factories, although discussions were widely held in various regions after the National Trade Union Work Conference made a resolution last year, many regions have not yet earnestly implemented it. The main reason is that factory administrative personnel have not paid sufficient attention to this issue. In order to make state-owned and public factories in various regions earnestly rely on the working class to do a good job in production, establish factory management committees, implement the democratization of factory management, and mobilize various regions to study the "People's Daily" editorial "February 7th" - "Learn to Manage Enterprises", the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on the Establishment of Factory Management Committees in State-Owned and Public Factories" on February 28th. The full text of the instructions is as follows:

　　At present, in the vast majority of regions across the country, the Liberation War has come to an end. The central task for 1950 is to restore and develop production. To achieve this great task, state-owned and public factories and enterprises must carry out a series of planned and step-by-step reforms of the various unreasonable systems left over from the era of bureaucratic capital rule. The central link of this reform is to establish factory management committees, implement the democratization of factory management, so that workers personally feel that they are the masters of the enterprise, change their labor attitude, and give full play to their production enthusiasm and creativity. At present, some administrative heads of state-owned and public enterprises are not clear enough about the viewpoint of relying on the masses of workers to manage enterprises well. The erroneous idea of relying solely on administrative orders to complete production tasks still exists, which is a major obstacle in the work of transforming bureaucratic capital enterprises. The Financial and Economic Committees of various regions should guide and supervise all factory and enterprise administrative personnel to earnestly study the "February 7th" editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" published in the "People's Daily", link it with reality, criticize various erroneous ideas of distrusting the masses and bureaucratic work styles, and cooperate with trade unions to discuss specific methods and steps for implementing management democratization. In factories and enterprises where factory management committees have not yet been established, they should immediately begin to earnestly implement the "Implementation Regulations on the Establishment of Factory Management Committees and Employee Representative Conferences in State-Owned and Public Enterprises" promulgated by the North China People's Government in 1947, and report the implementation situation at any time. If it is necessary to change the methods stipulated in the decision due to different local conditions, it should also be submitted to the committee for approval in advance.

　　财经委员会指示国营公营工厂认真建立工厂管理委员会
    保证完成恢复与发展生产任务
    【新华社北京四日电】关于国营、公营工厂管理民主化及经营企业化的问题，经去年全国工会工作会议作出决议之后，各地虽曾普遍进行讨论，但迄今不少地区尚未认真执行。主要原因是工厂行政人员对此问题尚未充分注意。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为使各地国营、公营工厂认真依靠工人阶级作好生产，建立工厂管理委员会，实行工厂管理民主化，并动员各地学习人民日报《二七》社论——《学会管理企业》一文，特于二月二十八日发布《关于国营、公营工厂建立工厂管理委员会的指示》。指示全文如下：
    目前在全国绝大部分地区中，解放战争已告结束，一九五○年的中心任务，是恢复与发展生产。要达成这一伟大任务，在国营、公营工厂企业中，必须把原来官僚资本统治时代遗留下来的各种不合理的制度，进行有计划有步骤的一系列的改革。这种改革的中心环节，就是建立工厂管理委员会，实行工厂管理民主化，使工人亲身感到自己是企业的主人，而改变其劳动态度，发挥其生产积极性与创造性。目前尚有某些国营、公营企业的行政负责人，对依靠工人群众管好企业的观点不够明确，单凭依靠行政命令来完成生产任务的错误思想，依然存在，这是改造官僚资本企业工作中的很大障碍。各地财经委员会应指导并督促所有工厂企业行政人员，切实研究人民日报发表的《学会管理企业》的《二七》社论，联系实际，批判各种不相信群众的错误思想与官僚主义作风，并协同工会讨论实行管理民主化的具体办法和步骤。在尚未建立工厂管理委员会的工厂企业中，应根据一九四七年华北人民政府所颁布《关于在国营、公营企业中建立工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的实施条例》，立刻开始认真执行，并将执行情形随时具报。如因当地情况不同，须将该决定中所规定之办法加以变更者，亦应预先呈报本委核准。
