    Rational Improvement of Labor Organization More Than Doubles Output

    [Our Newspaper] The Pingyuan Machinery Factory, under the Pingyuan Provincial Industrial Company, has significantly improved its production efficiency through the rational organization and utilization of labor. Previously, the factory lacked strict division of labor in its various departments, and there were no records of daily work activities, resulting in significant labor waste and low production efficiency. After investigation, the factory leadership first improved labor organization in the furnace and sand casting departments. Smelters were dedicated to smelting, round iron workers were dedicated to rounding iron, and sand mold makers were dedicated to making sand molds, implementing a strict division of labor. Simultaneously, the work of each worker per hour was recorded, and two shifts of workers doing the same type of work were brought together to work, encouraging mutual observation and competition, which rapidly improved production efficiency. For example, forging bolts in the furnace department previously required three heats and two firings, with each worker only able to produce 125 pieces per day. After researching and improving the labor organization, one additional person was added to each furnace, reducing the number of heats by two and the number of firings by one. According to the first day of testing, each worker could forge 160 pieces, an increase of 28% compared to before. Later, due to increasing familiarity with the work, the production rate further increased, and the current daily output per worker has reached 280 pieces, an increase of 124% compared to the original. The efficiency of the sand casting department in producing water turbine pipes also increased by 24%. As a result, the factory completed its February production tasks on time, with the furnace department completing them three days ahead of schedule. However, the current scrap rate of the factory is over 15%, resulting in significant losses. Efforts should be quickly made to study and overcome this issue in order to reduce costs and increase production.

    合理改进劳力组织  产量提高一倍以上
    【本报讯】平原省实业公司所属之平原机器厂，合理组织使用劳力，生产效率显著提高。该厂过去各部门没有严格分工，每天工作情况又没有记载，因此劳力浪费大，生产效率低。经过检查发觉后，该厂领导上首先在烘炉、翻砂二个部门改进劳力组织；打炼的光打炼，圆铁的光圆铁，做沙模的专门做沙模，实行了严格的分工，同时每工每小时的工作都进行登记；并将同样活的二班工人在一起工作，使之互相观摩竞赛，所以生产效率迅速提高。如烘炉上打炼子，原来要经过三番手、两回火，每工每天只能做一百二十五件。经过研究改善劳力组织后，每盘炉增加一个人，可以减少两番手、一次火就可完活。据头一天试验，每工可打一百六十件，比以前提高百分之二十八；后来由于业务日益熟悉，生产率愈加提高，现每天每工产量提高达二百八十件，较原来增加百分之一百二十四。翻砂部造水车管子的效率也提高了百分之二十四。因此该厂二月份的生产任务得按时完成，烘炉部门并提前三天完成。但目前该厂废活约占百分之十五以上，损失甚为重大。应迅速研究克服，以降低成本，增加生产。
