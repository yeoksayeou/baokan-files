　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. The South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet government has, on MacArthur's orders, opened the southern Korean territorial waters to Japan, allowing Japanese "fishing boats" to operate freely. According to the Pyongyang Democratic Overseas Chinese Newspaper, citing a United Press Tokyo dispatch: Lee Byung-jik, the Foreign Minister of the Lee Seung-man puppet government, bluntly stated in early February: "If Japanese fishing boats intrude into Korean territorial waters, we must never interfere with their actions again, because this is the order of MacArthur Headquarters." At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida also boasted in the Japanese Diet: "From now on, the South Korean government will no longer arrest Japanese fishing boats." Previously, Lee Seung-man's Coast Guard had arrested Japanese "fishing boats" that had intruded into South Korean territorial waters. As a result, under the auspices of MacArthur Headquarters, Lee Seung-man's representative in Japan participated in a joint meeting, and the result of the "agreement" was: Lee Seung-man released the Japanese "fishing boats" and opened the southern Korean territorial waters to Japan. The Yoshida government also demanded compensation of 100 million yen from the Lee Seung-man government.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Roberts, the head of the U.S. military advisory group stationed with the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet government, openly and directly commands the massacre of South Korean people. According to the South Korean Labor News and "Korean Communications": Roberts, accompanied by the puppet government's "Minister of National Defense" Shin Sung-mo and "Police Advisor" Beyete, departed from Seoul on February 16th on the military aircraft "Samchulli" to "inspect" various locations. On the 16th, he inspected the so-called "Suppression" Headquarters stationed in Daejeon, Chungcheongnam-do. Roberts personally led a certain company into action on the same day, directly commanding the massacre of the South Korean people. On the 17th and 18th, they began to organize military and police forces in Daegu and Busan to supervise the massacre of the people by various police corps. It is also planned to direct "suppression" operations in Gwangju County, Jeollanam-do from February 23rd, in an attempt to eliminate the increasingly powerful people's guerrillas.

    【新华社二十三日讯】南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府已奉麦克阿瑟之命，对日开放朝鲜南部的领海，让日本“渔船”任意活动。据平壤民主华侨报引合众社东京消息称：李承晚傀儡政府外务长官李秉直二月初曾直言不讳地宣称：“如遇日本渔船侵入朝鲜领海时，我们决再不能干涉它们的行动了，因为这是麦克阿瑟总部的命令。”同时，日本首相吉田亦在日本国会上夸口说：“从今以后，韩国政府将不再逮捕日本渔船了。”在此以前，李承晚的海岸警备队曾逮捕过侵入朝鲜南部领海的日本“渔船”，结果，在麦克阿瑟总部的主持下，李承晚的驻日代表参加一个联席会议，“协议”的结果是：李承晚放还日本“渔船”、对日开放朝鲜南部领海。吉田政府并向李承晚政府要求赔偿金一亿元。
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国驻南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府的军事顾问团团长罗伯兹，公然直接指挥屠杀南朝鲜人民。据南朝鲜劳力者报及《韩国通讯》消息：罗伯兹曾于二月十六日偕同傀儡政府“国防长官”申成模及“警察顾问官”培野特等人，搭军用机“三千里号”由汉城出发赴各处“视察”，于十六日检阅了驻忠清南道大田的所谓“讨伐”司令部。罗伯兹当天并曾亲自率领某中队出动作战，直接指挥对南朝鲜人民的屠杀。十七、十八两天，他们又在大邱与釜山着手组织用以监督各警察大队屠杀人民的军警部队。并预定在二月二十三日至全罗南道广州县指挥“讨伐”作战，妄图消灭日益强大的人民游击队。
