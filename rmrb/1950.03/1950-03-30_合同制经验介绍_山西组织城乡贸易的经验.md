　　Introduction to the Contract System Experience
    Shanxi's Experience in Organizing Urban-Rural Trade
    In Shanxi Province, supply and marketing cooperatives have initially played a linking role in the exchange of materials between rural small producers and state-owned trading agencies by signing trade contracts with state-owned trading companies. This provides an important method for further rationally organizing urban-rural trade.
    Since October of last year, the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and its branches in various regions have successively signed trade contracts with state-owned trading companies. These include the cotton purchase contract signed by the Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives with the Taiyuan branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation at the end of October last year; the contracts signed in mid-November by the federation with the Taiyuan branches of the grain, oil, and general merchandise companies for the purchase of grain and oilseeds on behalf of the state, and for the sale of industrial products on behalf of the state; and the trade contracts signed by the supply and marketing cooperatives of four special districts, including Yuci and Changzhi, and over twenty counties, including Zuoquan, Xiyang, Yuci, Heshun, Licheng, Taigu, Shouyang, Pingding, Yangqu, Mengxian, Changzhi, Qin County, Lingchuan, Pingshun, Lucheng, Wutai, and Dingxiang, with state-owned native produce, mountain product, and fur companies.
    Based on the experience of the past two months, the advantages of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trading companies conducting trade through contracts are as follows:
    (1) Planned purchase of native products to overcome the blindness of rural small producers. The signing of trade contracts guarantees the completion of the state's material purchase plan on the one hand, and promotes the sale of rural small producers' products in an organized manner on the other hand. This not only stimulates the production of local products, but also gradually overcomes the blindness of small-scale production. After the Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives signed a contract with the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation to purchase cotton on behalf of the state, it organized the supply and marketing cooperatives of the Yicheng and Fenyang special districts to complete the task of purchasing 320,000 catties of cotton in November last year. After the Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Native Produce and Mountain Products Company, it signed contracts with 55 village cooperatives in the county, organizing 53 of the 69 walnut-producing villages in the county to shell walnut kernels and collectively sell more than 58,000 catties. Fifty of the 64 codonopsis pilosula (dangshen) producing villages in the county were also organized to concentrate the dangshen and sell it through state-owned trading companies. After the Lingchuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Native Produce Company, it also signed contracts with 65 village cooperatives in the county, organizing more than 1,800 people to shell walnut kernels, and organizing carpenters in 33 disaster-stricken villages to manufacture wooden boxes for packing walnut kernels. After the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Native Produce and Mountain Products Company, it also organized 513 sulfur mines to carry out production, and the products were transported and exported through state-owned trading agencies. In this way, the sales of many local products have been resolved, and even large quantities of hemp skins and oilseeds, which were difficult to sell in Changzhi, Yicheng and other places in previous years, can be exported continuously.
    (2) Direct supply of industrial products to small producers, reducing intermediate exploitation. Due to the signing of contracts, on the one hand, supply and marketing cooperatives pay attention to investigating the needs of small producers and can obtain industrial products directly from state commercial agencies in a more planned manner to supply small producers. On the other hand, state-owned trading agencies can sell industrial products in a planned manner, directly linking them to small producers through supply and marketing cooperatives, restricting the activities of speculative merchants, and reducing the exploitation of small producers. The cooperative societies in various counties of Changzhi Special Zone that signed contracts with state-owned trading companies have all investigated the consumption of their members. After organizing the purchase of agricultural products, the Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied its members with more than 61,000 catties of edible salt, more than 26,100 chi of homespun cloth, more than 7,000 chi of foreign cloth, more than 600 catties of kerosene, and more than 8,000 pieces of various farm tools in two months. After helping its members sell agricultural products, the Lingchuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative also purchased 41,000 catties of edible salt, more than 1,300 catties of kerosene, more than 5,800 chi of foreign cloth, and more than 17,000 chi of homespun cloth from state trading agencies according to its consumption plan. From December 1st to 20th last year, the Taiyuan branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation supplied the Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives with yarn and cloth worth 701.778 million yuan according to the contract; the Taiyuan branch of the General Merchandise Company supplied the Provincial Federation with industrial products worth 319.393 million yuan.
    (3) Due to the assistance of state trading agencies to supply and marketing cooperatives in terms of prices, the business of supply and marketing cooperatives is easy to develop. The Lingchuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative greatly gained the support of its members by purchasing walnuts from members at a price 200 yuan higher than the market price. The cooperative societies in various villages of Qin County stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperative because they organized the exchange of large quantities of hemp skins for cheap industrial products. In the contracts signed by the Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives with the Oil and General Merchandise branches, it is clearly stipulated that when members sell oilseeds, they will be purchased at a price 2% higher than the market price. When members purchase general merchandise, they will be given priority at a price 2% lower than the list price. As a result, the influence of cooperative societies among the masses has greatly increased.
    (4) Promoting rural sideline industries and improving technology. Because the contract clearly stipulates the specifications of the exchanged items, it promotes the improvement of rural sideline production technology, thus enabling products to obtain a broader sales market. For example, in the case of Lucheng's straw hat braiding industry, due to the contract stipulations, the previous coarse braids were improved and finely processed. Not only did sales increase greatly, but prices also increased, directly increasing the income of rural handicraft workers.
    At present, there are still some shortcomings in the implementation of contracts between supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trading agencies. For example, some trading agencies are unwilling to give preferential treatment to cooperatives in terms of prices, fearing trouble; some cooperative cadres have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint and treat state-owned trading agencies with the attitude of private merchants. These are phenomena that need to be overcome and improved.

　　合同制经验介绍
    山西组织城乡贸易的经验
    山西省各地的供销合作社，由于和国营贸易公司订立了贸易合同，在农村小生产者与国营贸易机关的物资交换上初步发挥了纽带作用，为进一步合理地组织城乡贸易提供了一个重要的方法。
    自去年十月份以来，山西省的供销合作总社和各地分社陆续与国营贸易公司签订了贸易合同，其中有去年十月底省供销总社与花纱布太原分公司签订的购棉合同，十一月中旬该社与太原的粮食、油脂、百货等分公司分别签订的代购粮食、油料及代销工业品的合同，榆次、长治等四个专区供销社及左权、昔阳、榆次、和顺、黎城、太谷、寿阳、平定、阳曲、盂县、长治、沁县、陵川、平顺、潞城、五台、定襄等二十余县的供销社分别与国营的土产、山货、皮毛等公司签订的贸易合同等。
    根据两个月来的经验，供销合作社和国营贸易公司签订合同进行贸易，有下面几个好处：
    （一）有计划收购土产，克服农村小生产者盲目性。贸易合同的签订，一方面保证了国家收购物资计划的完成，一方面有组织的推销了农村小生产者的产品，不但刺激土产品的生产，而且还可以逐渐克服小生产的盲目性。省总社与花纱布公司订立了代购棉花的合同后，即在去年十一月份内组织了翼城、汾阳两专区的供销社完成了购棉三十二万斤的任务。平顺县供销社与土产山货公司订立合同后，便与该县五十五个村社订立合同，使全县六十九个产核桃村中有五十三个村组织起来敲核桃仁，集体推销了五万八千余斤。该县六十四个产党参村中也有五十个村组织起来将党参集中起来经过国营贸易公司推销。陵川县供销社与土产公司订立合同后，亦与全县六十五个村社订立合同，组织了一千八百余人敲核桃仁，并组织灾区三十三个村的木匠制造装核桃仁的木箱。阳泉工矿区供销社与土产山货公司订立合同后，亦组织了五百一十三个硫磺矿进行生产，产品经国营贸易机构运输出口。这样，许多土产的销路都得到了解决，甚至往年难于推销的长治、翼城等地的大宗麻皮与油籽等土产，也能源源出口。
    （二）直接供给小生产者工业品，减轻中间剥削。由于合同的签订，一方面，供销社就注意调查小生产者的需要，能较有计划地向国家商业机关直接取得工业品，供给小生产者，另一方面，国营贸易机关能有计划地推销工业品，通过供销社和小生产者直接联系起来，限制了投机商人的活动，使小生产者少受中间剥削。长治专区与国营贸易公司订立合同的各县合作社，均调查了社员的消费情况。平顺县供销社在组织收购农产品后，两月中即供给社员食盐六万一千余斤，土布两万六千一百余尺，洋布七千余尺，煤油六百余斤，棉花七百余斤，各种农具八千余件。陵川供销社帮助社员出售农产品后，亦按其消费计划，向国家贸易机关购入食盐四万一千斤，煤油一千三百余斤，洋布五千八百余尺，土布一万七千余尺。去年十二月一日至二十日，花纱布太原分公司即按合同供给省供销社价值七亿零一百七十七万八千元的纱、布；百货太原分公司供给省总社价值三亿一千九百三十九万三千元的工业品。
    （三）由于国家贸易机关在价格上对供销社的帮助，使供销社业务易于得到发展。陵川供销社因以高于市价二百元的价格收购社员的核桃，大大得到社员的拥护。沁县各村合作社，由于组织以大批麻皮换得便宜工业品，刺激了群众争先入社。省供销总社与油脂、百货分公司签订的合同中，均明确规定社员出售油料时，按高于市价百分之二的价格收购。社员购买百货时，以低于牌价百分之二的价格优先售给。因而合作社在群众中的影响大为提高。
    （四）促进农村副业提高技术。由于合同中明确规定了交换物品的规格，促进了农村副业生产技术的提高，因而使产品获得更广阔的外销市场。如潞城的草帽辫业，由于合同规定，改进了以往粗辫，并精细加工，不仅销路大增，价钱也提高，直接增加了农村手工业者的收入。
    目前供销合作社与国营贸易机关间在执行合同上尚存在着一些缺点，如某些贸易机关对合作社不愿在价格上优待，怕麻烦；某些合作社干部有单纯营利观点，以私商态度对待国营贸易机关等现象，这是需要克服和改进的。
