　　Review of the Opera "Everyone Rejoices"
　　Ma Shaobo
　　The Xidan Amusement Society recently staged Comrade Ma Jianling's opera "Everyone Rejoices." Like most of the audience, I affirm the success of this performance with extreme joy. The author, with profound life experience and mature skills, depicts the transformation process of a ne'er-do-well in the production movement, which is concise, profound, and full of humor. Who says that urban masses don't like to understand the lives of farmers? Who says that "clowns" must be bad people? And who says that the form of "variety show" isn't art and will inevitably destroy the "unity" of the theatrical form? The performance of "Everyone Rejoices" answers these questions.

　　What is especially commendable is the joint effort of the Xidan Amusement Society's artists: Wei Xikui, who excels at drums and Ping opera; Wei Changlin, who excels at Taiping Lyrics; Cao Baolu, who excels at single-string narratives; Guan Xuezeng, who excels at Qinshu storytelling; Gu Rongfu, who excels at Peking opera and single-string narratives; Yin Fulai, who excels at Qiankun ballade; the musician Wu Changbao, as well as Song Huiling, who is skilled in Xiang Ling techniques; and Wang Shuying, an eleven-year-old skilled in Kongzhu (Chinese yo-yo) techniques. These nine people shared all the roles in the play. It is very commendable that they could achieve such good results with their existing conditions. I think the performance mainly demonstrates the following characteristics:

　　1. The actors are serious and earnest, have life experience, emotion, are meticulous, and just right. This is already rare among professional actors; in the so-called "ten different kinds of acrobatics," being able to perform so realistically is even more valuable. Skills have not been dramatically staged, for example, Wei Changlin's portrayal of Wang Sanbao, with a delicate and profound understanding of the emotions of a ne'er-do-well, and the emotional development is also very natural; especially his attitude of criticism within sympathy and ardent hope within criticism for Wang Sanbao. The basic attitude of the script is correct, and it is rare that the actor can correctly grasp this key. The scenes such as the ne'er-do-well borrowing rice, the village cadre advising him, and the village chief and the ne'er-do-well reclaiming wasteland are particularly wonderful, also because the actors understand that transforming the ne'er-do-well must rely on patient education, enlightening awareness, and adhering to the principle of combining coercion and voluntarism, so that it can be fascinating. All the actors fulfilled their duties and showed their abilities while respecting the plot. For example, Gu Rongfu's usual impression among the audience is very funny and laughable. This time, he plays Aunt Feng Er, not only playing a female role, but also a "cross-dressing" of a respectable character. Not only does he play it like the character, but he also completes the requirements of the script very well. The audience can't help but give Aunt Feng Er full respect. It would be very difficult to achieve this without superior acting skills.

　　2. In terms of artistic form, they appropriately used existing skills and strengths. For example, there are many kinds of songs: Taiping Lyrics, Shuban clapper talk, Kaoshan tune, Nancheng tune, Qiankun ballad, Qinshu storytelling, and even Ping opera and Peking opera. However, in practice, they sound very harmonious and natural, and there is no feeling of "inconsistency." Moreover, the tunes are varied, making them sound fresh and pleasant. I think the main reason is that they paid attention to combining the plot and appropriately selecting and developing their specialized and mature skills in the use of tunes. For example, Aunt Feng Er's flowing-water clapper rap when she hears that the ne'er-do-well stole the thread is much better than the original tune of the play.

　　3. The arrangement of the entire evening's program, from shallow to deep, from light to heavy, although is a general rule; but for the society, it is to firmly grasp its business characteristics, after several wonderful solo skill performances, the final joint performance of "Everyone Rejoices," is really like a dramatic skill summary at the end, which is beneficial to the audience; I think it is also very beneficial to the artists themselves, because through theatrical performances, they can get all-round training in acting skills, widely absorb nutrients from practice, and more effectively improve and develop their own business; moreover, how to make "ten different kinds of acrobatics" a collective art, and even give it the principles of storytelling and drama, may not be one of the paths for the development of folk art, I think this path is very broad and far-reaching.

　　I hope that the friends of the Xidan Amusement Society will constantly overcome difficulties, correct shortcomings, continue to work hard, persevere, rehearse new plays, and rehearse modern plays. With the existing conditions, using this form, the script is not a problem. You can choose from the existing New Peking Opera, New Ping Opera, New Opera, and even spoken drama scripts, and after a little modification, you can quickly rehearse them. Because you can use your most familiar tunes as much as possible, you can save time and get twice the result with half the effort. As long as it is used appropriately, the masses will welcome it.

　　评歌剧《大家欢喜》
    马少波
    西单游艺社最近上演了马健翎同志的歌剧《大家欢喜》。我象大多数观众一样的，以极其欣喜的心情肯定这次演出的成功。作者以深刻的生活体验、成熟的技巧，描写一个二流子在生产运动中的改造过程，简短、深刻、而且饶有风趣。谁说城市群众不喜欢了解农民的生活？谁说“丑角”一定是坏人？又有谁说“大杂会”的形式不是艺术，就一定会破坏了戏剧形式的“统一”呢？《大家欢喜》的演出，答复了这些问题。
    尤其难得的，是西单游艺社艺人们的共同努力：长于大鼓、评戏的魏喜奎，长于太平歌词的魏长林，长于单弦的曹宝禄，长于琴书的关学曾，长于皮簧、单弦的顾荣甫，长于金钱落子的尹福来，琴师吴长宝以至擅有翔翎技艺的宋慧玲，擅有空竹技术的十一岁的王淑英，九个人分担了剧中的全部角色，以他们的现实条件，能有如此好的成就，是很值得称赞的，我以为演出方面，主要表现了以下的特色：
    一、演员严肃认真，有生活，有感情，细腻入微，恰到好处。这在职业演员已不可多得；在所谓“十样杂耍的锻炼，而能演得如此真实”的艺人，他们只有单一的、完整、有分寸，更足可贵。技艺，并没有经过戏剧舞台例如魏长林饰王三宝，对于二流子身分感情的体会，细腻深刻，在感情发展上也很自然；尤其对于王三宝在同情中寓批评，批评中又寄予热烈的希望，剧本的这一基本态度是正确的，难得演员能够正确的掌握了这一关键。二流子借米，乡干部劝告，乡长和二流子开荒等场之特别精彩，也是由于演员懂得了改造二流子必须依靠耐心教育，启发觉悟，而又必须坚持强制与自愿结合的原则，因此才能引人入胜。全部演员作到了在尊重剧情的原则下，人人逞能，个个尽职。例如顾荣甫平日在观众中的印象，是很滑稽可笑的，此次饰冯二婶，不仅是演女角色，而且可以说是“反串”正派人物，不但演得象，而且很好的完成了剧本的要求，观众对于冯二婶不由得不给予充分的尊敬。如果没有优越的演技，是很不容易作到的。
    二、在艺术形式上适当的运用了现有的技巧和优长，例如歌调很多样化：太平歌词、数板、靠山调、南城调、金钱落子、琴书，以至评戏、皮簧，但是实际听来，还很和谐自然，并无“不统一”的感觉，而且调子变化多，听来很新鲜悦耳，我想主要是他们在运用曲调上，注意了结合剧情，适当选择，而又发挥了专行的成熟技巧，例如冯二婶听说二流子偷线时，所唱的流水板快书，比原剧的曲调，好的多了。
    三、整个晚会节目的排列，由浅而深，由轻而重，虽是一般的规律；但在该社则是紧紧把握其业务特色，在多次单人技艺精彩表演之后，最后联合演出《大家欢喜》，真好象最后来一次戏剧性的技艺总结，对于观众是有益的；我想对于艺人本身也是很有益的，因为通过戏剧表演，可以得到演技上各方面的锻炼，从实践中广泛的吸受养分，对于本行业务，会更有效的提高和发展；而且如何使《十样杂耍》成为集体艺术，以至有原则的赋予故事性、戏剧性，也未始不是曲艺发展的道路之一，我想这一道路，是很宽广远大的。
    希望西单游艺社的朋友们不断的克服困难，改正缺点，继续努力，坚持下去，排演新戏，排演时装戏。以现有条件，利用这种形式，剧本是不成问题的。在现有的新京剧、新评剧、新歌剧以至话剧本中去选用，稍加修改，便可很快的排出来。因为尽量运用自己最熟悉的调子，可以节省时间，事半功倍，只要用的恰切，群众是欢迎的。
