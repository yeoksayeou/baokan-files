　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th: The CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau recently issued a decision on strengthening the work of the New Democratic Youth League in the Central-South region, requiring the establishment of youth league organizations throughout the region in a step-by-step manner this year. It also determined that the basic tasks of the Youth League in the Central-South region in 1950 are: to unite and educate the broad masses of young people, actively participate in the workers' movement, the peasants' movement, and various activities, and to strive for the restoration and development of production and rural anti-hegemony, rent reduction, and land distribution, and to continuously train and improve themselves from these revolutionary practices. The decision pointed out that because the vast majority of areas in Central-South are newly liberated areas, the organization of the Chinese Communist Party should not adopt a policy of mass development. Therefore, the work of building the league in the new areas is of particular importance. The decision pointed out that the mass development of the Youth League is an important political task of the Chinese Communist Party in the current situation. It is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over the work of the Youth League, implement the CCP Central Committee's policy of building the league by the whole Party, rapidly establish Party committees, youth committees, and League work committees at all levels, train a large number of cadres, continue to overcome the tendency of closed-doorism and prevent the formalistic tendency of simply pursuing numbers, and under the leadership of the Party committees, unfold the work of the Youth League in a prepared, led, and planned manner.

　　中共中央中南局决定
    贯彻全党建团方针
    【新华社汉口十四日电】中共中央中南局顷发出关于加强中南区新民主主义青年团工作的决定，要求在今年全区有步骤地普遍建立青年团的组织，并确定一九五○年中南区青年团的基本任务是：团结教育广大青年，积极参加工人运动、农民运动和各种活动，为恢复发展生产和农村反霸，减租、分配土地而斗争，从这些革命实践中不断地训练和提高自己。决定指出：由于中南绝大部分地区是新解放区，中国共产党的组织不应采取大量发展方针，因此，新区建团工作是具有特殊重要意义的。决定指出大量发展青年团，是中国共产党在目前形势下的一个重要的政治任务。必须加强党对青年团工作的领导，贯彻中共中央的全党建团的方针，迅速建立各级党委、青委和团的工作委员会，大量训练干部，继续克服关门主义和防止简单追求数字的形式主义的偏向，在党委的领导下，有准备、有领导、有计划地展开青年团的工作。
