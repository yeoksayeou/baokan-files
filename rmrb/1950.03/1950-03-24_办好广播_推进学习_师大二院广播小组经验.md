　　Running Broadcasting Well, Promoting Learning
　　——Experience of the Broadcasting Group of the Second Normal College
　　The daily broadcasting program of the Broadcasting Group of the Second Normal College is divided into two parts: one part is the rebroadcast of news, youth programs, and art and literature programs from the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, as well as some important ad hoc programs; the other part is the campus broadcast, which is divided into entertainment, learning, and service programs. When the broadcasting group started, there was no established work system, some group members were extremely busy, others were extremely idle, and no one knew how to write the manuscripts supplied by the students. Therefore, the work was very chaotic, and the content of the programs was not exciting enough. Later, at the get-together of the Broadcasting Group of the Literature Department of the Normal University, Dean Jiao Juyin pointed out to us: "If the Broadcasting Group of the Literature Department of the Normal University wants to do well, it must have a detailed work plan and a strict work system." According to Dean Jiao's instructions, we repeatedly discussed and established a work system:
　　First, regularly rebroadcast news, youth programs, and art and literature programs from the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station.
　　Second, establish a duty system and clear division of labor: each group member is on duty once or twice a week, responsible for daily business; the group is divided into editing, learning, entertainment, and general affairs groups, responsible for organizing campus programs and supplying news稿件 to the radio station; the group also established a meeting system.
　　In this way, we initially overcame bureaucracy and chaos in our work.
　　The most popular programs among the students are the youth programs and news, especially the current affairs talks and youth lectures in the youth programs. Some students said happily after listening to the current affairs talks: "This systematic way of connecting major domestic and foreign events of the week makes my understanding of reality more profound." When the radio station broadcast Comrade Hu Hua's lecture on the new Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreement, it solved the problems of many students. According to our experience, in order to make the effect of students listening to the radio better, it is very important to publicize the content of the broadcast before listening to it.
　　Now the students in our school have made listening to the radio an indispensable part of their daily life. This is because the broadcasting group has relatively close ties with the student union, teaching committee, CCP branch, Youth League branch, cultural troupe, correspondents group, library, health group, trade union, cooperative, and other units, so the broadcasting programs can be closely integrated with the lives of the majority of students. Our broadcasting programs often cooperate with political class learning, introduce learning experiences, and report on learning situations. Once, we introduced the "point the generals" method in group discussions. On the same day, a group of freshmen in the history department used this method, setting up a point the generals platform in front of the dining hall and asking other groups to answer questions. In addition, we promoted many recreational activities and helped the cultural troupe. We once cooperated with the student union and the cultural troupe to call on students to get up early, which was enthusiastically responded to by the students. When evaluating student grants, one class did not review strictly. We criticized it in the broadcast, which attracted everyone's attention, and they carefully reviewed it again, correcting the deviation of the first time. Recently, the student union and the air defense committee called on students to participate in digging air defense trenches, and we encouraged everyone through broadcasting, and most students actively participated.

　　办好广播  推进学习
    ——师大二院广播小组经验
    师大二院广播小组每天的广播节目分成两部分：一部分是转播北京市人民广播电台的新闻、青年节目、文艺节目和一些重要的临时节目；还有一部分是校内的广播，分为文娱、学习、服务几个节目。广播小组开始时，没有订立工作制度，小组组员忙的特别忙、闲的特别闲，同学给小组供给的稿件也不知道怎么编写，因此，工作就很混乱，节目内容也不够精彩。后来在师大文学院广播小组联欢会上，焦菊隐院长向我们指出：“要想师大文学院广播小组搞得好，必需有一个周密的工作计划和严格的工作制度。”根据焦院长的指示，我们便反复讨论，建立了工作制度：
    第一、固定转播北京市人民广播电台新闻、青年节目、文艺节目。
    第二、建立了值日制度和明确的分工：每位组员在每星期值班一次或两次，负责每天的业务；小组以下分成编辑、学习、文娱、总务四个分组，负责组织校内的节目供给电台通讯稿件；小组并且还建立了会议制度。
    这样，我们在工作当中就初步克服了事务主义和混乱的状态。
    同学们最欢迎的是青年节目和新闻，尤其是青年节目里的时事漫谈和青年讲座。有的同学听了时事漫谈以后很高兴地说：“这样有系统的把一个星期国内外的大事情连贯起来讲，使得我对现实的认识更深刻了。”广播电台播送胡华同志讲的中苏新条约新协定的时候，解决了好多同学的问题。根据我们的经验：要使同学们听广播的效果更好，在广播收听前展开广播内容的宣传是很重要的。
    现在我们学校的同学们已经把听广播变成日常生活当中不可缺少的东西。这是因为广播小组和学生会、教学委员会、中共支部、青年团支部、文工团、通讯组、图书馆、卫生组、工会、合作社等单位都有了比较密切的联系，所以广播节目便能紧密地和广大同学生活结合了。我们的广播节目经常配合政治课学习，介绍学习经验，报导学习情况。有一次，我们介绍了小组讨论中的“点将台”方式，当天历史系一年级一个小组就用了这个方法，在饭厅前设立了点将台，提出问题让别的小组解答。另外，我们带动了许多文娱活动，帮助了文工团。我们曾配合学生会、文工团号召同学们早起，结果得到同学们热烈响应。在评议助学金的时候，有一班审查的不严格，我们就在广播的时候加以批评，结果引起大家的注意，他们又重新仔细地评议了一次，纠正了第一次的偏向。最近，学生会和防空委员会号召同学参加挖防空壕，我们就通过广播鼓动大家，大多数同学都踊跃参加了。
