　　Leading Cadres Universally Value Learning
　　Cultural Level of a Certain Division in the Northeast Improves
　　Two Months In, More Than Half of All Officers and Soldiers Now Know At Least 500 Characters
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to an March 18th report from the *Forward Daily* of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region: Since a certain division of the Northeast Military Region strengthened its cultural education work beginning last November, the cultural level of all cadres and soldiers in the division has significantly improved.  At the beginning of December last year, statistics showed that those in the division who knew fewer than 100 characters accounted for 26.8 percent of the total, and those who knew fewer than 300 characters accounted for 48 percent. After two months of study, when a summary test was conducted in late January, those who knew fewer than 100 characters accounted for only 4.6 percent, and those who knew fewer than 300 characters accounted for 17.2 percent. Those who knew 500 characters or more accounted for 68 percent.  In arithmetic class, even the least advanced learned addition and subtraction. The average test score for the entire division was 74.7 points. The best performing unit was the infantry-artillery company of a certain regiment.  Except for nine people who only knew 200 to 400 characters, everyone else in the company knew at least 500 characters. There were also nine classes in the division where all soldiers reached a literacy level of 500 characters or more, and they all received the division's cultural bonus.  Three hundred and forty-two comrades in the division with excellent teaching results were rewarded and commended.
　　Ten Units Awarded Cultural Bonuses
　　The reasons for the division's achievements in cultural learning are primarily that the leading cadres valued cultural education work and implemented the spirit of the Northeast Military Region's propaganda and education conference in November of last year. The division has increased the time devoted to cultural education from five hours to twelve hours per week; each company has added a cultural instructor and stipulated time for the cultural instructor to prepare lessons; at the same time, a cultural bonus was established, and implementation measures for the cultural bonus were promulgated; furthermore, cadres were systematically sent to the companies to help guide cultural learning, in order to cultivate model companies in cultural learning.  Each regiment also selected key points to specifically guide the cultural learning of companies, platoons, and squads. All cadres in the division also actively participated in learning.  The phenomenon of occupying soldiers' cultural learning time for other work, which was quite prevalent in the military in the past, has been basically corrected.  The division also attached great importance to improving teaching methods. Each regiment held regular teaching preparation meetings; most cultural instructors prepared lesson plans carefully and corrected the soldiers' homework; and the "little teacher" system and mutual aid movement were widely promoted.
　　Experience has proven that the cultural bonuses set by the division greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm of officers and soldiers and promoted the efforts of each company to eliminate "dead corners" in learning, so that the learning of soldiers and support personnel could be universally carried out.  Although only one company and nine classes in the division received the cultural bonus this time, there were still many units that were close to the award-winning performance, which encouraged their confidence to continue moving forward.
　　The division's cultural education work still has some shortcomings: the regimental propaganda and education departments did not conduct sufficient in-depth inspections; individual battalions still occupied soldiers' learning time; some regiments did not properly study teaching methods and help cultural instructors prepare lessons when holding education preparation meetings, which turned into a form of giving lessons to cultural instructors; some cultural instructors did not conscientiously prepare lesson plans in advance and conduct teaching systematically; and the teaching progress was too fast, and the learning was not solid enough.
　　Encourage the Entire Division to Study, Promote the Spirit of Mutual Assistance, Promulgate the Second Cultural Bonus Implementation Measures
　　[Another Dispatch] In order to encourage cadres and soldiers to continue to work hard in their studies and to fully leverage the role of mutual assistance in learning, the division recently promulgated the second cultural bonus implementation measures, which are scheduled to be summarized and awarded at the end of June. The measures stipulate: the conditions for a company to receive an award are: all cadres and soldiers have a correct and active attitude towards learning, abide by the learning system, and do well in helping each other; nine-tenths of all cadres, soldiers, and support personnel know 500 characters or more and can write and speak them, and the remaining one-tenth can also know 400 characters or more. Arithmetic must complete the learning plan, everyone must pass the exam, and the average score must be above 80 points; regularly read the *Forward Daily*, *Soldier's Daily*, and *Northeast Daily*; the cultural and recreational activities are well done, and the blackboard newspaper is published regularly and successfully; and at least three articles are written for the *Forward Daily* each month. Companies that meet these conditions will each be awarded one million yuan (Northeast currency, same below); the best company will also be given a prize banner. The conditions for a platoon to receive an award: the learning attitude is the same as the previous item, and all comrades in the platoon know 600 characters and can speak and write them; the arithmetic exam scores are passed by everyone, and the average score is 85 points. Platoons that meet the above conditions will each receive a bonus of 400,000 yuan, and the best platoon will be given a prize banner. The conditions for individuals to receive an award: 1. Cultural instructors: work is stable and active, and the education plan for each period is completed, and those who have created teaching methods (cultural instructors of award-winning companies will receive special awards). 2. Mutual aid group leaders and "little teachers" with particularly good results. 3. Cadres and soldiers who have particularly good learning results and can actively help others. Cadres can also be responsible for maintaining classroom discipline. Individuals who have created the above achievements will be awarded prizes in two grades according to their achievements: the first grade will be awarded prizes worth 70,000 yuan; the second grade will be awarded prizes worth 50,000 yuan; and this achievement will be used as one of the conditions for earning merit.

　　领导干部普遍重视学习
    东北某师文化提高
    两个月中，全师指战员识字显著增加。
    识五百字以上者已占百分之六十八。
    【本报讯】据东北军区政治部前进报十八日消息：东北军区某师自去年十一月起加强文化教育工作以来，全师干部和战士的文化程度有显著提高。去年十二月初统计，全师识百字以下者占总人数的百分之二十六点八，识三百字以下者占百分之四十八。经过两个月的学习，于一月下旬进行总结测验时，识百字以下者已仅占百分之四点六，识三百字以下者为百分之十七点二。识五百字以上者已占百分之六十八。在算术课方面，最少的也学会了加减法。全师测验平均成绩为七四点七分。学习成绩最好的某团步炮连，全连除九人仅识二百字至四百字外，其余均已识字五百以上；全师还有九个班，所有战士达到识字五百以上，他们都获得了师的文化奖金。全师三百四十二名教学优良的同志，均受到了奖励与表扬。
  十个单位荣获文化奖金
    该师文化学习获得这些成绩的原因，主要是领导干部重视文化教育工作，贯彻了东北军区去年十一月宣教会议的精神。该师已将文化教育的时间由每周五小时增加到十二小时；各连增加了一名文化教员，并规定了文化教员准备功课的时间；同时，设立了文化奖金，颁布了文化奖金实施办法；又有计划地派干部深入连队，帮助指导文化学习，以培养文化学习的模范连队。各团也选择了重点，具体指导连队、排、班的文化学习。全师的干部也积极参加学习。过去部队中相当普遍地存在着的占用战士文化学习时间来进行其他工作的现象已基本上予以纠正。对教学方法的改进，该师也非常重视。各团按期召开教学准备会；大部分文化教员都认真地准备教案、给战士修改作业；并广泛地开展了小先生制及互助运动。
    经验证明，该师所设的文化奖金对指战员的学习情绪鼓励很大，而且推动了各连队想法去消灭学习中的死角，使战士和勤杂人员的学习能普遍开展。这次该师获得文化奖金的单位虽然只有一个连和九个班，但还有许多单位已接近获奖的成绩，鼓舞了他们继续前进的信心。
    该师文化教育工作中还存在着一些缺点：团宣教部门深入检查作得不够；个别营还占用战士的学习时间；有的团召开教育准备会议时，没有好好研究教学方法和帮助文化教员准备教课，形成了给文化教员上课的形式；有的文化教员对事先作好教案，有计划地进行教学来认真执行；教学的进度太快，学习还不够踏实。
    鼓励全师学习发扬互助精神颁布二届文化奖金实施办法
    【又讯】该师为鼓励干部与战士继续努力学习并充分发挥学习中的互助作用，最近又颁布了第二届文化奖金实施办法，预定在六月底总结发奖。该办法规定：连队受奖条件为：全体干部战士学习态度正确、积极，遵守学习制度，互相帮助做得好；全体干部战士勤杂人员十分之九识到五百字以上，并且能写、能讲，其余十分之一的人也能识到四百字以上，算术要完成学习计划，每人都能考试及格，平均八十分以上；经常读前进报、战士报、东北日报；文娱工作搞得好，黑板报出得经常而有成绩；每月最少给前进报写稿三篇。达到这些条件的连队，各奖一百万元（东北券，下同）；其中最好的连队，另赠奖旗一面。排的受奖条件：学习态度与前项同，全排同志识六百字，并能讲能写；算术考试成绩每人及格，平均八十五分。达到上述条件的排各发奖金四十万元，其中最好的排，赠奖旗一面。个人受奖条件：１、文化教员：工作安心、积极，完成每期教育计划，教学方法有创造者；（得奖之连队，文化教员受特等奖）。２、成绩特别好的互助组组长及小先生。３、干部战士学习成绩特别好，并能积极帮助别人。干部并能负责维持课堂纪律者。创造以上成绩之个人，按成绩分两等奖：一等发给价值七万元之奖品；二等发给价值五万元之奖品；并以此成绩作为立功的条件之一。
