[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Tianjin Daily on the 13th, the Tianjin Tax Bureau held a cadre meeting on the 12th to announce the corrupt and illegal acts of retained personnel such as Fan Dehong, and imposed corresponding punishments. Those with serious circumstances have been transferred to the People's Court for punishment. At the same time, more than 30 staff members who were honest and devoted to their duties were commended. After more than a year of study and education since liberation, the ideology and work style of the bureau's cadres have greatly improved, and they have promoted the excellent work style of honesty and devotion to public service in their work. For example, cadre Wang Yaohua discovered that Heji Firm had underpaid stamp tax. The merchant attempted to bribe him with a huge sum of one million yuan, but Wang Yaohua sternly refused. Another example is cadre Xu Huanda, who once discovered that a merchant was evading taxes. The merchant then tried to use his father's friend to intercede with Xu and offer him a bribe of 100,000 yuan, but Xu also resolutely refused. However, a few retained personnel such as Fan Dehong, Luo Yiqin, Ma Jinhai, and Liu Guanxun have not changed their past bad habits and continue to engage in embezzlement and bribery. Fan and Luo used to be stationed at the Danhua Match Factory as tax collectors. During their time at the factory, they accepted food supplies from the factory every month. Fan Dehong embezzled 1,100 packs of matches and one ton of coal from Danhua, plus cash, totaling approximately 15,477,700 yuan in Renminbi. He also accepted gifts from the factory twice for joyous and mourning occasions. According to investigations, Luo Yiqin also embezzled 1,800,000 yuan. His lifestyle was extremely corrupt, and he frequently visited dance halls and tea houses. He originally had a wife and two children, and in November of last year, he married a dancing girl as a concubine. Ma Jinhai was passive in his work, reactionary in his thinking, constantly spread rumors, undermined the unity between new and old cadres, and often beat and scolded taxpayer merchants, and engaged in embezzlement. Liu Guanxun, as an inspector of the Seventh Tax Office, once attempted to embezzle funds by taking advantage of his position, but failed. After discovering the above situation, the Municipal Tax Bureau repeatedly educated Fan and others, ordering them to confess and reflect, but Fan and others persisted in their errors and did not know how to repent. For this reason, the Municipal Tax Bureau held a general cadre meeting on the 12th to announce the criminal acts of Fan and others. During the meeting, the crowd was indignant, and more than 20 cadres took the stage to speak. Everyone unanimously demanded that legal sanctions be imposed on Fan and Luo for their actions that violated the interests of the people. The presidium of the meeting accepted the demands of all cadres, and the bureau announced the dismissal of Fan and Luo, and their transfer to the court for punishment according to law. Ma Jinhai was given the punishment of expulsion. Liu Guanxun, because the embezzlement was not successful, was allowed to reflect on his mistakes while remaining on the job. At the meeting, more than 30 staff members, including Wang Yaohua, Gan Yuheng, Huo Xinghua, and Li Chixiu, were commended on the spot for adhering to their revolutionary stand and refusing to accept bribes, and received enthusiastic applause and cheers from all the cadres. The meeting was a good education for all tax bureau cadres. Ma Rongxuan, Xing Enxiang, Cao Yonghui, and others, who had previously committed embezzlement or other wrongdoings, were deeply moved at the meeting and expressed to the meeting that they would reform themselves in the future.

　　天津税务局开干部大会
    表扬廉洁拒贿干部  惩处贪污腐化人员
    樊德洪罗裔勤被撤职送法院惩办
    【本报讯】据天津日报十三日消息：天津市税务局于十二日召开干部大会，宣布该局留用人员樊德洪等贪污犯法行为，分别予以处分，情节重大者已移送人民法院惩办。同时，对廉洁奉公的工作人员三十余人则予以表扬。该局干部经过解放后一年多的学习和教育，思想作风已较前大有进步，在工作中发扬了廉洁奉公的优良作风。例如干部王耀华发觉何记行漏贴印花，该商曾企图以一百万元巨款行贿，被王耀华严词拒绝。又如该局干部徐焕达有一次查觉某商逃税，该商即想借其父之朋友关系，以十万元向徐说情行贿，徐也坚决拒绝。但也有少数留用人员如樊德洪、罗裔勤、马金海、刘冠勋等始终不改过去恶习，仍继续贪污受贿。樊、罗二人，以前同为丹华火柴厂驻厂征收员，在驻厂期间，曾每月接受厂方伙食供给。樊德洪在丹华前后曾贪污火柴一千一百包、煤一吨，加上现款，约合人民币一千五百四十七万七千多元。并曾两次接受厂方喜丧送礼。据已查明者，罗裔勤也曾贪污了一百八十万元。其生活极端腐化，经常出入舞场茶厅，家中原有一妻二子，在去年十一月份又娶了一个舞女为妾。马金海平日工作消极，思想反动，不时散布谣言，破坏新老干部间的团结，并时常打骂纳税商民，且有贪污行为。刘冠勋为第七税务所稽查员，曾经利用职权，企图贪污未遂。市税务局发觉上述情形后，曾对樊等数度进行教育，令其坦白反省，但樊等坚持错误，不知改悔。为此，市税局于十二日召开全局干部大会，宣布樊等犯罪行为。会中，群情愤激，干部上台讲话者不下二十余人，大家一致要求对樊、罗二人违反人民利益的行为加以法律制裁。大会主席团乃接受全体干部的要求，并由局方宣布将樊、罗二人撤职，移送法院依法惩办；马金海则予以开除处分；刘冠勋因贪污未遂，准予带职反省。会上，另有王耀华、甘玉恒、霍兴华、李墀秀等三十几位工作人员，因为坚持革命立场，拒绝受贿，当场被提出表扬，并得到全体干部的热烈鼓掌和欢呼。大会对全体税局干部是一个很好教育。过去曾经犯过贪污或错误行为的马荣轩、邢恩祥、曹永惠等，因为在会上深受感动，也相继向大会表示：今后决改过自新。
