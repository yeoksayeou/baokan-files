Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Leadership organs in various parts of North China are adopting various methods to overcome the ideological concerns of some farmers and rural cadres regarding the development of production, advocating labor to build a family and production to become rich, in order to launch this year's agricultural production movement.

After the land reform, many farmers and rural cadres in North China were afraid of developing production, believing that if production was good and they became wealthy, they would be "sticking their necks out," would "attract the wind," and would be "struggled against." The saying "production does not save, labor does not lead to wealth" was popular in rural areas. Some rural cadres even said: "Don't produce too much, just eat what you have!" Therefore, the phenomenon of wasting the fruits of land reform and production was quite common. Not only did middle peasants not dare to produce more, but even the poor peasants who had been emancipated were unwilling to apply more fertilizer when farming. The main source of these ideological concerns was that some rural cadres and farmers did not understand the policies of the People's Government, and the absolute egalitarianism in some rural cadres had not been seriously liquidated. Another source of these ideological concerns was that some deviations occurred in the implementation of policies in land reform in various parts of North China in the past. For example, in some places, the interests of middle peasants were violated during the land reform, and no corrections were made afterwards; in some areas, the land reform had already ended, but land certificates were not issued for a long time, and many farmers who had been allocated land believed that the land was unreliable, thus generating the fear of further struggle and re-division, and they did not dare to expand production. Furthermore, some middle peasants were burdened too heavily when autumn grain was levied last year, and some areas levied public grain on newly reclaimed land and newly added paddy fields in violation of the law; in addition, some areas violated the principle of voluntary exchange at equal value in mutual aid work, forcibly borrowing tools and grain from middle peasants; all of these seriously hindered farmers from establishing the correct idea of getting rich through labor.

The Educational Significance of Labor Models Reporting Production Plans to Farmers is Great

In order to fully launch this year's great production movement and ensure the realization of the region's increased production plan, the leadership organs in various parts of North China paid attention to resolving these ideological concerns of rural cadres and farmers last winter. At the People's Representatives Conferences at all levels held in Chahar, Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces last winter, the representatives were explained that the purpose of land reform was to develop agricultural production, and various questions raised by the representatives were answered. For example, at the People's Representatives Conferences at all levels recently held in Hebei Province, the responsible persons of the county people's governments further explained the government's policy of promoting production to the representatives when discussing and formulating the increased production plan. Many labor models attending the conference reported their past production situation and future production development plans to the farmers after returning to the villages, which had a great educational effect on the farmers. In addition, during the winter training of party members and the holding of winter schools by the local CCP committees last winter, the various policies of the New Democracy construction and the history of social development were emphasized to the party members and cadres, so that the party members and cadres could understand the spirit of the future of social development and the current various policies, and understand the importance of increasing production. In order to further solve this ideological problem, the People's Governments of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar and other provinces recently promulgated various specific regulations to protect land rights, property rights, and reward increased production, and called on cadres to publicize them in depth to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production. When publicizing, explaining and implementing these policies and laws, the leadership organs in many places also paid attention to the specific situation of the local area, avoiding the generalized method, which has achieved great results. For example, the People's Government of Wuxiang and other places in Shanxi Province emphasized "borrowing and returning," "compensation for damage," and "the owner's convenience" in response to the local phenomenon of forced borrowing. The People's Governments at all levels in Hebei Province paid great attention to the publicity of determining land rights and protecting the fruits of labor of all classes during the spring plowing mobilization, and carried out the work of assessing land yield to ensure the implementation of the policy of reasonable burden. The People's Governments at all levels in Chahar Province paid special attention to the work of issuing land certificates in villages that have completed land reform, so that farmers can rest assured to carry out production.

　　华北各地领导机关采各种办法
    克服农民生产思想顾虑  通过各界人民代表会大力宣传政策，并发布保护地权财权的具体规定。
    【新华社二十七日讯】华北各地领导机关正在采取各种办法克服一部分农民群众和农村干部对于发展生产的各种思想顾虑，提倡劳动发家、生产致富，借以展开今年的农业生产运动。
    经过土地改革以后，华北各地不少农民和农村干部害怕发展生产，认为生产好了、富裕了，就是“冒了尖”，就会“招风”，就会被“斗争”。农村中流行着所谓“生产不节约，劳动不致富”的说法。甚至有些农村干部也说：“别多生产，有了就吃点！”因此，浪费土地改革果实和生产果实的现象相当普遍，不但中农不敢多生产，就是翻了身的贫农种地时也不愿多上粪。这些思想顾虑的主要来源，是一部分农村干部和农民群众不了解人民政府的政策，而在一部分农村干部中的绝对平均思想还未认真清算。这些思想顾虑的另一种来源，是过去华北各地在土地改革中在执行政策上发生了若干偏差。如有些地方在土地改革中侵犯了中农的利益，事后也未进行纠正；有些地区土地改革业已结束，但迟迟不发土地证，许多分得土地的农民认为土地是靠不住的，因而产生了怕再斗争、再平分的思想，不敢扩大生产。再次，是去年征收秋粮时发生了某些中农负担过重的现象，有些地区不按法令规定而征收新开荒地、新增水田的公粮；此外还有些地区变工互助时违反自愿等价政策，强借中农工具、粮食等；这些都严重地妨碍了农民树立正确的劳动致富的思想。
  劳动模范报告生产计划对农民的教育意义很大
    为全力开展今年的大生产运动和保证全区增产计划的实现，华北各地领导机关于去冬即注意解决农村干部和农民群众中的这些思想顾虑。察哈尔、河北、山西、平原等省在去冬所召开的各界人民代表会议上，都向代表们讲解了土地改革的目的就是为了发展农业生产，并解答了代表们的种种疑问。如河北各县人民政府负责人在最近召开的各界人民代表会议上，在讨论拟定增产计划时，向代表们更进一步地解释了政府提倡生产的政策，许多与会的劳动模范回村后，向农民报告自己过去的生产情况与今后发展生产的计划，对农民的教育作用很大。此外，各地中共党委于去冬集训党员、举办冬学过程中，对党员干部均着重地进行了新民主主义建设的各种政策以及社会发展史的教育，使党员干部认识了社会发展前途及当前各种政策的精神，认识了提高生产的重要性。为着进一步解决这一思想问题，日前河北、山西、察哈尔等省人民政府，都发布了保护地权、财权及奖励增产的各项具体规定，并号召干部深入宣传，提高农民生产热忱。在宣传解释与贯彻这些政策法令时，许多地方的领导机关并注意针对当地的具体情况，避免一般化的方法，收效很大。例如山西省武乡等地人民政府针对当地强借现象，强调了“有借有还”、“损坏赔偿”、“物由主便”等。河北省各级人民政府在春耕动员中十分注意地进行了确定地权和保护各阶层劳动成果的宣传，并进行了评定土地产量的工作，保证合理负担政策的贯彻。察哈尔省各级人民政府特别注意在已完成土地改革的村庄，颁发土地证的工作，使农民安心进行生产。
