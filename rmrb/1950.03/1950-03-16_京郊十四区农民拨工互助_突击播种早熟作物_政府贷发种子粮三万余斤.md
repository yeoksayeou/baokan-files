　　Farmers in Fourteen Suburban Districts of Beijing Help Each Other with Labor
    Rush Plant Early-Maturing Crops; Government Loans and Distributes Over 30,000 Catties of Seed Grain
    [Our Newspaper] To shorten the spring famine, farmers in the fourteen districts of suburban Beijing are actively rushing to plant early-maturing crops – kidney beans, barley, spring wheat, potatoes (potatoes), etc. For this reason, the district production committee specially sent cadres deep into villages and households to mobilize farmers, calling on them to help each other solve difficulties such as seeds and livestock; the government loaned some seeds to disaster-stricken households and newly emancipated farmers. Each village also has cadres drawn from the village office, farmers' association, and cooperative to form a grain lending committee or a grain lending group, responsible for lending seeds. Now the entire district has loaned out more than 33,000 catties of early-maturing crops and millet, enough to plant more than 2,540 mu. Each village has planned to collectively purchase seeds in groups, which saves labor and avoids the tendency of individual households eating or not using the seeds for production. It has become a common phenomenon in various villages that households with livestock and vehicles and households without livestock and vehicles help each other with labor. Farmers in Shiba Li Dian have organized eight labor exchange groups on a voluntary basis, and twelve households in Zhangjia Dian are working in two shifts to rush plant early-maturing crops. Farmers in villages such as Xiaohongmen, Madao, and Paifang all said, "The government is calling on us to grow early-maturing crops, mainly to help us connect earlier, which is a really good method!"
    The district expects to plant 20,000 mu of early-maturing crops, and a large part of the northern part will also grow vegetables in gardens, plus more than 76,000 mu of wheat sown last year, totaling more than 100,000 mu of early-maturing crops, which will play a decisive role in shortening the spring famine this year.

　　京郊十四区农民拨工互助
    突击播种早熟作物  政府贷发种子粮三万余斤
    【本报讯】为了缩短春荒，京郊十四区农民正积极突击播种早熟作物——芸豆、大麦、春麦、土豆（马铃薯）等。该区生产委员会为此事先曾专派干部深入村、户进行动员，号召农民互相帮助解决种籽、牲畜等困难；对受灾户及新翻身的农民则由政府贷给一部种籽。各村并由村公所、农会、合作社抽出干部组成贷粮委员会或贷粮小组，负责贷出种籽。现在全区已贷出早熟作物及小米三万三千斤多，能种二千五百四十多亩。各村都有计划地结组集体购买种籽，这样既节省劳力，又可避免个别户吃掉及不用于生产上的偏向发生。有牲口、车的户和没有牲口、车的户拨工互助，在各村已成普遍现象。十八里店农民在自愿的条件下组织起了八个拨工组，张家店十二户农民分两班换工突击种早熟作物。小红门、马道、牌坊等村农民都说：“政府号召咱们种早熟庄稼，主要是为了让咱们早接口，真是好办法！”
    该区预计种早熟作物两万亩，北半部还有大部园子种菜，加上去年播种小麦七万六千多亩，共计早熟作物十万多亩，在今年缩短春荒上将起着决定作用。
