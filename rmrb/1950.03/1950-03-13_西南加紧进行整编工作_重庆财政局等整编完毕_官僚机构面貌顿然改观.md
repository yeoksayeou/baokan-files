Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th. Prior to the publication of the Central People's Government's decision on unified national financial and economic work, the agencies and public enterprises at the Southwest Great Administrative Region level and in various parts of Sichuan had already begun reorganization work, and have been intensifying it since the announcement of the aforementioned decision. The Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Chongqing Municipal-level agencies, as well as the Chuannan Administrative Office, have established reorganization committees. The reorganization work of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau and the city's Telecommunications Bureau, Dongchuan Postal Administration Bureau, Cable Car Company, Public Bus Management Office, and other units has concluded, achieving great results. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, these units had astonishingly bloated and large organizations. For example, the original Dongchuan Postal Administration Bureau had two assistant offices for finance and postal affairs in the director's office alone, and a savings and remittance section was set up in the savings and remittance branch, with nine groups under the section. The total number of staff reached 751. The cable car company only had two cars, but it also established a large agency with four departments and three offices, employing 48 people, resulting in huge expenditures and heavy debts before liberation. The Chongqing Municipal Finance Bureau had five departments and five offices, plus six additional sections, with more than 570 personnel. After the recent reorganization of these bureaucratic institutions, their appearance has undergone a sudden change. The Dongchuan Postal Administration Bureau reduced its staff by 538 people, leaving 213 people, but work efficiency actually improved. After the reorganization of the cable car company, the February income cleared previous debts and made an additional profit of 1,650 bank exchange units. Other units also improved their work efficiency after the reorganization. The various agencies have handled the surplus personnel prudently and properly, either sending them to study or arranging for them to return home for production.

　　西南加紧进行整编工作
    重庆财政局等整编完毕  官僚机构面貌顿然改观
    【新华社重庆十二日电】西南大行政区一级和四川各地的机关及公营企业在中央人民政府统一国家财政经济工作决定发表前即已开始整编工作，自上述决定公布后更加紧进行。中共中央西南局及重庆市一级机关和川南行署等已成立整编委员会，重庆市人民政府财政局及该市电信局、东川邮政管理局、缆车公司、公共汽车管理处等单位的整编工作已告结束，获得很大成绩。这些单位在国民党反动政府统治时期，机构臃肿庞大，极为惊人。如原东川邮政管理局仅局长室内即分设财务、邮务两个帮办室，又在储汇分局另设储汇股，股下又分九组，全局人员竟达七百五十一人。缆车公司仅有两部车子，也设立了四科三室的庞大机关，人员达四十八人，开支浩大，解放前欠债累累。重庆市财政局则有五科五室，另设六处，人员达五百七十余人。这些官僚机构经最近整编后，面貌顿然改观。东川邮管局裁减了五百三十八人，剩下二百十三人，工作效率反而提高。缆车公司整编后，二月份收入即偿清以前债务，另赢利一千六百五十个银行折实单位。其他各单位经整编后也提高了工作效率。对于编余人员各机关均作审慎妥善处理，或送学习，或安置回家生产。
