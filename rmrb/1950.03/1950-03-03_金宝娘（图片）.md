    The next day, when Liu Guicai saw that Genyuan had run away, he didn't dare to make a sound, fearing that if the higher-ups knew that a Communist had escaped, he would be implicated. However, his desire for Cuicui grew even stronger. Later, he fabricated a rumor saying, "Genyuan ran away and was caught and shot!" Since her son's incident, Genyuan's mother had been crying all day long, wanting to commit suicide, and she had cried herself blind.
    (Thirty)
    In Genyuan's home, the old cried, and the young wailed; Cuicui tried to comfort them all day long, unable to take care of everyone at once. There was no food at home, and every day she had to go to the fields to dig wild vegetables and glean crops; even so, Cuicui never said a word of complaint to her mother-in-law.
    (Thirty-one)
    They finally managed to get through the summer and autumn. This winter was particularly difficult, with no food from one meal to the next. One day, so hungry that she couldn't bear it anymore, Cuicui took Jinbao to beg from the neighbors. Genyuan's parents were usually very kind to people in the village, and seeing the pitiful woman and child, people gave them a half-sheng or a sheng of food.
    (Thirty-two)
    A few days later, her mother-in-law fell ill, and Jinbao was as thin as skin and bones. Cuicui took Jinbao to beg for food, but no one would give her anything. Later, an old woman secretly told her, "Guicai has spread the word that anyone who gives you food will be his enemy! You think half the village is farming his land, who dares to oppose him!" Cuicui didn't get any food and returned home crying.

    金宝娘
    邢琏画
    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （二十九）
    第二天，刘贵财见根元跑了，也没敢声张，怕上边知道跑了共产党，自己受连累。可是，他想翠翠的心更切了。随后，他便造出谣言说：“根元跑出被抓住枪磞了！”根元娘自儿子出了这事，整天啼哭，要寻死上吊，把眼也哭瞎了。
    （三十）
    根元家里，老的哭，小的叫；翠翠整天劝解，一个人顾了这头顾不了那头。家里吃的也没有了，每天她还得去地里挖野菜，拾庄稼；翠翠就这样，也没在娘跟前说了句不顺气的话。
    （三十一）
    一夏天一秋天，总算熬渡过来了。这年冬天，可难过了，吃了上顿没下顿。一天饿的实在没法了，翠翠抱着金宝到左邻右舍去乞求，根元爹娘平时在屯里为人很好，人们又见女人娃娃可怜，都一升半升给了些。
    （三十二）
    过了几天，娘病了，金宝瘦得皮包骨头。翠翠抱着金宝去讨吃，但谁家也不给了。随后，有一个老太婆悄悄告诉她说：“人家贵财放了话，谁家要给你吃的，谁家就是他的对头！你想半个村子都是种人家的地，谁敢和人家做对！”翠翠一点东西也没有要着，哭着回来了。
