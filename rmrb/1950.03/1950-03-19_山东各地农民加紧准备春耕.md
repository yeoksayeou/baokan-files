Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: Farmers in Shandong Province are organizing mutual aid work teams and intensifying preparations for spring plowing, including accumulating fertilizer, purchasing farm tools, and seeds. Various localities are actively preparing for mutual aid work teams to facilitate spring plowing. In Tancheng County, through publicizing various production policies and summarizing last year's experience in mutual aid, work teams and plowing teams have been widely reorganized, and winter-plowed land has been harrowed. Farmers in other counties such as Boxing, Zhanhua, Deping, and Linyi have also begun mutual aid work. Last year, a fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched throughout the province, greatly increasing fertilizer for spring land. According to statistics from 430,000 farm households in Jiaodong, more than 12 million carts of fertilizer have been accumulated. The Jiaodong Cooperative recently purchased 300,000 jin of fertilizer powder and 5 million jin of night soil from other places, preparing to loan it to farmers who lack fertilizer. The Lunan Cooperative also organized urban night soil to be sent to the countryside. To solve the food shortage problem for farmers during spring plowing, the Shandong Provincial Branch of the People's Bank recently issued 53.41 million jin of spring agricultural loans in grain. The Bohai Cangnan Special Zone has also recently loaned 650,000 jin of relief grain. In addition, cooperatives in various places are actively promoting the sale of by-products for farmers in exchange for grain. The Jiaodong Cooperative is purchasing hemp and other products from farmers with 5 million jin of grain. In terms of preparing farm tools, the Lunan Cooperative has ordered 10,000 plowshares from outside the province to loan to farmers, and instructed county cooperatives to purchase a large number of farm tools according to the needs of farmers. Farmers in Houzhuang Township, Licheng County, purchased a total of 220 new farm tools and 15 head of cattle. Various counties in Jiaodong are also providing agricultural science knowledge training to 40,000 farmers who are production activists in order to improve farming techniques.

　　山东各地农民加紧准备春耕
    【新华社济南十八日电】山东省农民正组织变工互助，并加紧进行积肥、购买农具、种籽等春耕准备工作。各地正纷纷准备变工互助，准备春耕。郯城县通过宣传各项生产政策，总结去年变工的经验，普遍整理了变工组和搭犋组，并已耙好冬耕地。其他博兴、沾化、德平、临邑等县农民也开始变工互助。去年全省各地均展开了积肥运动，使春地肥料大增。据胶东四十三万农户统计，积肥已达一千二百余万车。胶东合作总社最近又从外地收购肥田粉三十万斤、大粪五百万斤，准备贷放给缺少肥料的农民。鲁中南合作总社并组织城市大粪下乡。为解决农民春耕中的口粮困难，人民银行山东省行最近发放春季农业贷款粮五千三百四十一万斤，渤海沧南专区近亦贷放救济粮六十五万斤，另外，各地合作社则大量为农民推销副产品，换取粮食。胶东合作社以五百万斤粮食收购农民大麻等。在准备农具方面，鲁中南合作总社向外订购一万张犁头贷放给农民，并指示各县社根据农民需要大量购买农具。历城县侯庄乡农民共买进新农具二百二十件，耕牛十五头。胶东各县并对四万农民生产积极分子施以农业科学知识的训练，以便提高耕作技术。
