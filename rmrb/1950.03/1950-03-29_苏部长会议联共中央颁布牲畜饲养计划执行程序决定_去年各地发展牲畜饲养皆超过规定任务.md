Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th, TASS: The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have recently promulgated a decision on the implementation procedures of the three-year plan (1949-1951) for developing productive publicly-owned livestock breeding on collective farms and state farms.

The decision points out that the three-year plan adopted by the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on April 18, 1949, stipulates that the task of comprehensively developing livestock breeding is the central task of the Party and the state in developing agriculture. This plan is being successfully implemented.

In 1949, collective farms and state farms greatly increased the number of livestock and poultry and their productivity, developed new livestock farms, and consolidated the public livestock feed base. Many collective farms, many states, and all districts have overfulfilled the tasks prescribed by the three-year plan for developing livestock breeding for 1949. Last year, many sheds for livestock on collective farms and state farms were built, and the feeding and care of livestock were improved. Much work has been done in the mechanization of labor required in livestock farms and feed processing, as well as in the training of animal husbandry personnel.

The upsurge in productive publicly-owned livestock breeding on collective farms and state farms in 1949 has ensured an increase in the amount of milk, butter, eggs, wool, and leather delivered to the state. The results of implementing the three-year plan for developing livestock breeding in 1949 demonstrate that both collective farm publicly-owned livestock breeding and state farm livestock breeding are increasingly dominating the country in terms of the total number of livestock and the proportion of first-class livestock products.

The Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs of all states, territories, and union republics have completed the task stipulated by the Party and the government to organize four productive livestock and poultry farms on each collective farm in 1949. Last year, nearly 72,000 new farms for raising beef cattle and dairy cows and 48,000 poultry farms were organized on collective farms.

Collective farm livestock exceeds planned targets:
	Large horned cattle increase by 22 percent
	Sheep and goats increase by 19 percent
	Pigs increase by 78 percent
	Poultry increases by more than double

In 1949, collective farms expanded livestock farms, and many collective farms have reached the minimum increase in the number of various productive livestock and poultry that should be increased by the end of 1951.

In 1949, the number of large horned cattle on collective farms increased by 22 percent, including an increase of 27 percent in the number of cows. The number of beef cattle and dairy cows increased by 27 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. In 1949, more than 16,000 new large horned cattle farms were organized on collective farms, and their average area has also been increased.

The quality of livestock delivered when paying the state's fixed quota of meat has also improved. According to the materials of the USSR Ministry of Meat and Dairy Industry, the quantity of high-quality large horned cattle delivered to the state in 1949 increased by 31 percent compared to 1948, and by 20 percent compared to 1940. The number of sheep and goats on collective farms increased by 19 percent in 1949, and by 44 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. Last year, the average area of sheep farms in various collective farms has been expanded, and 18,800 new farms have been organized. The quantity of sheep delivered to the state in 1949 has increased, and the quality of wool delivered to the state has also improved.

In 1949, the number of pigs on collective farms increased by 78 percent, and by 16 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940. Last year, a total of 36,700 new pig farms were organized on collective farms, and the area of existing pig farms has been expanded. In 1949, the work of fattening pigs was greatly improved compared to 1948, so that collective farms delivered more than twice as much pork to the state than in 1948.

State farms deliver more to the state:
	Pork: 74 percent
	Milk: 35 percent
	Wool: 13.1 percent
	Eggs: 58 percent

In 1949, the Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs of all states, districts, and union republics have done much work in organizing poultry farms and increasing the number of poultry on collective farms. The number of poultry on collective farms more than doubled in 1949, and increased by 48 percent compared to the pre-war level.

In terms of developing livestock breeding on state farms: the number of large horned cattle on state farms increased by 14 percent in 1949, pigs increased by 50 percent, sheep and goats increased by 12 percent, and poultry increased by 35 percent. The number of large horned cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats on state farms has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. As a result of the increase in livestock productivity and the increase in the number of various livestock, state farms delivered 63 percent more meat to the state in 1949 than in 1948, including 74 percent more pork, 35 percent more milk, 13.1 percent more wool, and 58 percent more eggs. Much work has been done in consolidating the feed base for collective farm livestock breeding, building sheds for livestock, and building reservoirs. The mechanization of the labor process in livestock farms has increased.

In accordance with the three-year plan for developing livestock breeding, collective farms and state farms have completed important measures to improve livestock productivity and the quality of breeding stock in 1949. Last year, the breeding of breeding stock also increased. At the end of 1949, the proportion of these breeding stock in the total number of livestock was: on collective farms, 34 percent of large horned cattle, 51 percent of pigs, and 53 percent of sheep; on state farms, 72 percent of large horned cattle, 70 percent of pigs, and 84 percent of sheep. In the past two years, the number of fine-wool sheep, medium fine-wool sheep, and coarse-wool sheep raised on collective farms and state farms has increased by 52 percent. Livestock productivity on collective farms and state farms has also increased.

The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have charged the Party and economic organs with intensifying assistance to collective farms and state farms in breeding highly productive breeding stock (which the state gives them to improve less productive livestock) to ensure the unconditional completion of the task of breeding highly productive livestock in 1950.

The decision drafted specific measures to ensure the further development of collective farm livestock breeding and addressed issues such as livestock breeding methods, veterinary medicine, the training of livestock personnel, and scientific research in this area.

　　苏部长会议联共中央颁布牲畜饲养计划执行程序决定
    去年各地发展牲畜饲养皆超过规定任务
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏联部长会议与联共中央顷颁布关于发展集体农场及国家农场生产性公有牲畜饲养三年计划（一九四九——一九五一年）之执行程序的决定。
    决定指出：一九四九年四月十八日苏联部长会议与联共中央所通过的三年计划，规定了全面发展牲畜饲养的任务为党与国家在发展农业方面的中心任务。这一计划正在顺利地付诸实现。
    一九四九年，集体农场与国家农场已大大增加了牲畜与家禽的只数和它们的产物生产率，并且发展了新的牲畜饲养场和巩固了公有牲畜饲料基地。许多集体农场、许多州和所有的区，都已超计划完成了发展牲畜饲养三年计划为一九四九年所规定的任务。去年建筑了许多供集体农场与国家农场牲畜用的棚舍，对于牲畜的喂养与照顾也已改善，在牲畜饲养场中所需劳动力的机械化和饲料的处理，以及养畜业人才的训练方面，已做了许多工作。
    一九四九年，在集体农场及国家农场生产性的公有牲畜饲养上所获得的高涨，已保证了向国家交纳牛奶、牛油、鸡蛋、羊毛与皮革数量的增加。一九四九年履行发展牲畜饲养三年计划的结果，证明集体农场公有性畜饲养与国家农场牲畜饲养两者在牲畜总只数以及在生产头等牲畜产品的比重上，越来越在国内占着优势。
    各州、各边疆区、各加盟共和国的党、苏维埃与农业机关，完成了党与政府所规定的要在一九四九年在每一个集体农场上组织四个生产性的牲畜与家禽饲养场的任务，去年一年已在集体农场上组织了将近七万二千个新的饲养食用牛与乳牛的饲养场和四万八千个家禽饲养场。
  集体农场牲畜超过计划情形  大角牲畜增百分之二十二  绵羊山
        羊增百分之一十九  猪增百分之七十八  家禽增一倍多
    一九四九年，集体农场已扩大了牲畜饲养场，并且有许多集体农场已达到为一九五一年底而规定的关于各种生产性牲畜与家禽只数所应增加的最低额。
    在一九四九年，集体农场大角牲畜的只数增加了百分之二十二，其中包括母牛只数增加额百分之二十七。食用牛与取乳牛的只数较之战前一九四○年增加了百分之二十七。一九四九年，在集体农场上新组织了一万六千余个大角牲畜饲养场，而其平均面积也已加大。
    在给国家缴纳定额肉类时缴纳的牲畜，在质量上也有了改善。根据苏联肉类及乳品工业部的材料，一九四九年缴纳给国家的品质优良的大角牲畜的数量，较一九四八年增加了百分之三十一，较一九四○年增加了百分之二十。集体农场绵羊与山羊的头数，在一九四九年增加了百分之十九，与战前一九四○年相较，则增加了百分之四十四。去年，各集体农场的绵羊饲养场的平均面积业已扩大，并且组织了一万八千八百个新的饲养场，一九四九年缴纳给国家的绵羊数量增加了，缴纳给国家的羊毛的品质也有增进。
    一九四九年，集体农场猪的头数增加了百分之七十八，与战前一九四○年相较，则增加了百分之十六。去年，各集体农场共组织了三万六千七百个新的饲猪场，并且已扩充了现有的饲猪场的面积。一九四九年，使猪增重的工作较一九四八年大有改进，从而使集体农场缴纳给国家的猪肉较一九四八年增加了一倍多。
  国家农场多给国家交纳  猪肉：百分之七十四  牛奶：百分之三
        十五  羊毛：百分之十三·一  鸡蛋：百分之五十八
    一九四九年，各州、区及各加盟共和国的党、苏维埃及农业机关，在组织家禽饲养场及增加集体农场家禽数目方面，已作了许多工作。集体农场家禽只数在一九四九年内增加了一倍多，与战前水平相较，则增加了百分之四十八。
    在发展国家农场的牲畜饲养方面：国家农场一九四九年大角牲畜的只数增加了百分之十四，猪增加了百分之五十，绵羊和山羊增加了百分之十二，家禽增加了百分之三十五，国家农场大角牲畜、猪、绵羊和山羊的只数，已大大地超过了战前水平。由于牲畜产物生产率的增加以及各种牲畜只数增加的结果，一九四九年国家农场较一九四八年多给国家交纳了百分之六十三的肉类，其中包括猪肉百分之七十四，牛奶百分之三十五，羊毛百分之十三点一，鸡蛋百分之五十八。在巩固集体农场牲畜饲养的饲料基地、建筑供牲畜住用的棚舍，以及建筑蓄水池方面已做了许多工作。牲畜饲养场的劳动力过程的机械化已经增加了。
    遵照发展牲畜饲养三年计划，集体农场及国家农场在一九四九年已完成了关于改进牲畜产物生产率和种畜质量的重要措施。去年，种畜的繁殖亦有增加，一九四九年底，这些种畜在牲畜的总只数中的比重为：在集体农场，大角牲畜百分之三十四、猪百分之五十一、绵羊百分之五十三；在国家农场，大角牲畜百分之七十二、猪百分之七十、绵羊百分之八十四。在过去两年内，集体农场与国家农场饲养的上等细毛羊、中等细毛羊及次等绵毛羊的头数增加了百分之五十二。集体农场与国家农场牲畜产物生产率也有增加。
    苏联部长会议及联共中央责成党与经济机关在繁殖生产性较高的种畜（这是国家送给它们用以改良生产性较低的牲畜的）方面，加紧帮助集体农场与国家农场，以保证在一九五○年内无条件地完成繁殖有高度生产性的牲畜的任务。
    决定草拟了保证进一步发展集体农场牲畜饲养的具体措施，并论及牲畜业的牲畜饲养法、兽医、牲畜业人材的训练以及在这一方面的科学研究工作诸问题。
