Readers' Suggestions on Various Tasks Have Been Forwarded to Relevant Authorities

　　Lin Weizhen (housewife, residents' group leader): Your reflections on the difficulties of citizens' production and the difficulties of women's lives and job seeking are very accurate. As you said, this is not a problem that can be solved all at once, but the People's Government is constantly working to gradually solve these problems. Your opinion on the large number of bank staff and low efficiency has been forwarded to the People's Bank.
    Grandpa Zu Dexin: We greatly admire you for studying diligently in the political class of the Civil Education Center at over sixty years old. Your suggestion in the letter that the government should set up more factories to solve the unemployment problem is correct. All the government's current efforts are aimed at achieving industrialization as soon as possible. However, setting up factories requires capital, machines, and technical personnel; these cannot be obtained all at once. We hope everyone will work together to help the government complete tax collection, save expenses, and accumulate construction funds.
    He Dianchun (worker in the Third Inner District), Liu Hui, Lin Yuanpeng: Your suggestions on air defense have been forwarded to the Air Defense Headquarters.
    Ma Longbi, Xi Zhi: Your opinions on unifying Chinese translations have been forwarded to the General Administration of Publications.
    Zhu Hong: Your opinion that the lead wires on the trolley poles at the Yuhe Bridge tram stop often trip pedestrians and your request for modification have been forwarded to the Tram Company.

　　读者对各项工作的建议  已分别转达各有关机关
    林维珍（家庭妇女，居民小组长）君：你对于市民生产的困难、妇女生活与求职的困难等情况的反映都是很对的。正如你所说的，这不是一下子可以解决的问题，但人民政府无时不在努力使这些问题逐渐求得解决。你对于银行人员多、效率低的意见已转交人民银行。
    祖德馨老先生：你已六十多岁了，还很努力地在民教馆政治班学习，我们非常钦佩。你来信建议政府多设工厂以解决失业问题，这建议是正确的。政府目前一切努力都在于力求工业化的早日实现。但设工厂需要资金，需要机器，需要技术人员；这却不是一下子可以取得的，希望大家协力帮助政府完成税收、节约开支，积累建设的资金。
    何殿春（内三区工人）、刘慧、林元鹏诸君：您们对防空的建议已转交防空司令部。
    马龙璧、希治诸君：你们关于统一中文译名的意见，已转交出版总署。
    朱洪君：您对于御河桥电车站电线杆上的铅丝时常绊倒行人，要求改装的意见已转交电车公司。
