Xinhua News Agency, March 21st - To implement the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on unifying national financial and economic work, trade treasuries have been successively established in important cities in North China, and branch treasuries are being established in various towns and cities. As of the 19th, branch treasuries have been established in Tianjin, Taiyuan, Xinxiang, Baoding, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Gui Sui, and other places, and sub-branch treasuries have been established in Yuci and other places. From the date of the establishment of the treasuries, state-owned trading organizations in various regions will deposit their daily sales cash into the national treasury and implement a daily, level-by-level reporting system. The branch companies of various specialized companies have also deposited their daily sales cash into the local People's Bank acting as the treasury before the establishment of local sub-branch treasuries.

The deposit of trade cash into the national treasury in North China is just beginning, and some problems remain to be solved in the future. After the promulgation of the decision and order of the Government Administration Council on unified financial and economic work, various specialized companies in Shanxi Province were still unable to specifically revise their business plans, and the deposit of cash was not strict enough. For example, on the 16th, the cash deposited by the province's department store company was only slightly more than 14 percent of the original accumulated cash. The Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank has decided to conduct an inspection. Also, during the establishment of the Tianjin Treasury, some specialized trading companies experienced a lack of coordination between various departments due to insufficient preparation, which increased the difficulty of the work.

　　华北各重要城市
    建立贸易金库
    严格执行现金缴库制度
    【新华社二十一日讯】为贯彻执行中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，华北各省重要城市贸易金库，已先后建立，各市镇支库亦正分别建立中。至十九日止，已有天津、太原、新乡、保定、唐山、张家口、大同、归绥等地建立分库，榆次等地已建立支库。各地国营贸易机关自金库建立之日起，即将每日售货现金解缴国库，并执行逐日逐级上报制度。各专业公司所属支公司，亦已在当地支库建立前，将日售现金缴所在地人民银行代理金库。
    华北各地贸易现金解缴国库尚系开始，还存在一些问题有待今后解决。山西各专业公司于政务院统一财经工作决定命令颁布后，尚不能具体修订业务计划，解缴现金也还不够严格。如该省百货公司十六日入库现金仅及原积存现金百分之十四强，人民银行山西省分行已决定予以检查。又在天津金库建立中，有些专业贸易公司因各种准备不够，发生各部门间配合不够的现象，增加了工作中的困难。
