　　The people's representative conferences held in various regions have not only strengthened the ties between the government and the people, jointly overcome difficulties, and promoted work, but have also educated government staff. At the conferences in various places, representatives criticized the bureaucratic work style of a few staff members and shortcomings in the implementation of policies. The general response from cadres was: "It is impossible to get away with not practicing democracy and resorting to coercion." At the same time, many cadres learned democratic work styles at the meetings. For example, village cadres in Yishui County said after the meeting: "The county lets us listen to how much public grain is collected, and we have to settle the village finances when we go back, give the masses an account, and ask the masses to give us their opinions." The promotion of this top-down democratic work style has also improved and promoted practical work.
    However, some shortcomings still exist in the conferences in various places. In some individual areas, there was insufficient understanding of the significance of the broadness and representativeness of representatives in the elections. For example, representatives designated by district and village cadres accounted for 20 percent of all representatives at the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Weibei County. At some meetings, some government staff members did not fully understand the spirit of the People's Representative Conference and, instead of taking a consultative attitude towards some incorrect opinions, immediately refuted them. At some meetings, government leaders spoke too much, reducing the opportunity for representatives to speak. Some government staff members did not pay enough attention to the meetings and were often absent. Some government staff members did not have a concrete understanding of the situation below and the urgent demands of the masses before the meeting, so they could not grasp the central issues to be resolved at the meeting, and made resolutions on nearly a hundred proposals, which made the representatives lack confidence in their implementation. Regarding these shortcomings, various regions have learned from their experience and are gradually correcting them.

　　民主作风得到发扬官僚主义受到批判
    各地召开的各界人民代表会议，不仅密切了政府与人民的联系，共同克服了困难，推动了工作，同时也教育了政府工作人员。在各地会议上，代表们对于少数工作人员的官僚主义作风和执行政策中的缺点等都进行了批评。一般干部的反映是：“不讲民主和强迫命令是吃不开了。”同时，不少干部在会上学会了民主作风。如沂水县的村干部在会后说：“县里收多少公粮都算账给咱听听，咱回去也得结算村财政，算个账给群众听听，叫群众给咱提意见。”这种上行下效的民主作风的发扬，也改进和推动了实际工作。
    但是，在各地会议中尚存在着一些缺点。有个别地区在选举中对代表的广泛性和代表性的意义认识不够，如潍北县各界人民代表会议的代表，由区、村干部指定的占全部代表百分之二十。有的会议上，部分政府工作人员对人民代表会议的精神尚领会不够，对个别不正确的意见，不是采取商讨的态度，而是立即反驳。有的会议上政府负责人说话太多，减少了代表的发言机会。有的政府工作人员对会议重视不够，常常缺席。有些政府工作人员在开会前对下面情况和群众当前的紧迫要求了解不够具体，因此对会议要解决的中心问题掌握不住，将近百余件提案统统作了决议，使代表没有信心执行。对于这些缺点，各地已经吸取经验，在逐渐纠正中。
