Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 12th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Highway Work in 1950," stipulating the tasks of highway work for this year, engineering plans, highway grades, engineering standards, as well as the principles and methods for mobilizing civilian labor for road construction, road maintenance, and the organizational leadership of highway operations.

The decision first pointed out: "The task of highway work in 1950 is to continue supporting the Liberation War, strive for the complete victory of the country, and restore production. Except for construction urgently needed to support the war, the general approach is to selectively repair existing highways based on necessity and feasibility, and to organize and repair existing transportation tools and factories to improve their transportation capacity and productivity."

Regarding the division and management responsibilities of national and provincial highways, the decision pointed out: "Those with national significance in military and economic aspects are national highways, directly managed by the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications"; "Regional highways within a province or several provinces are provincial highways, supervised by the transportation departments of major administrative regions and managed by the provincial transportation departments." The routes and engineering standards of the national highway network are to be determined by the Ministry of Communications in consultation with relevant departments, and implemented after approval by the Government Administration Council. The national highways to be repaired and renovated this year include the Xi'an-Lanzhou-Tacheng line, the Lanzhou-Huajialing-Shuangshipu-Chengdu line, the Chengdu-Luzhou-Qujing-Kunming-Wanmading line, the Wuchang-Hengyang-Guiyang-Qujing line, the Wuchang-Nanchang-Minhou-Xiamen line, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu line, totaling 10,121 kilometers. The construction of provincial highways is to be planned by major administrative regions and provinces, and implemented after being submitted to the Central Ministry of Communications for approval; in principle, the construction costs of provincial highways this year will not be covered by the central government.

Regarding engineering standards such as the width of the highway, the curvature of the route, the load-bearing capacity of bridges and culverts, the width of bridges, and the slope of the road surface, all are to be formulated by the Ministry of Communications and promulgated after being submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for approval. Before the construction of national and provincial highway projects, surveying and design must be carried out, and drawings, construction procedures, budget estimates, and material budgets must be submitted to higher authorities for approval before construction can begin; after completion, engineering summaries and final accounts of funds and materials must be reported.

Regarding the mobilization of civilian labor for road construction, the decision stipulates that, with the approval of the provincial people's government, civilian labor can be appropriately mobilized to repair highways under necessary and feasible conditions, but it must not violate the farming season and must have a sound plan.

Regarding road maintenance, the decision stipulates that special personnel should be responsible for national and provincial highways, and the masses along the general highways should be educated and mobilized to carry out road maintenance. The decision also stipulates the principle of road users maintaining roads, with the competent authorities uniformly collecting vehicle road maintenance fees; vehicles can travel throughout the country after obtaining a fee license. The method for collecting road maintenance fees will be formulated by the Ministry of Communications and submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

Regarding the organization and leadership of highway operations, the Highway Bureau and the Transportation General Company are established under the Ministry of Communications to be responsible for highway construction, management, and transportation; bureaus or offices are established in major administrative regions and provinces as needed and possible to handle highway affairs; special districts and counties are responsible for completing highway plans and tasks in their respective areas. In addition, the Ministry of Communications will separately formulate detailed methods, systems, and regulations for vehicle management and land reservation on both sides of highways, which will be implemented after approval by the Government Administration Council.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 12th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Waterway Work in 1950," stipulating the main tasks of waterway transportation for this year, various construction projects and navigational aid equipment plans on waterways, waterway management, the organizational leadership of waterways, and the principles and methods for training waterway technical personnel.

The decision first pointed out: "The task of waterway work in 1950 is to continue supporting the Liberation War, liberate all of China, and serve the restoration of production."

Regarding various engineering construction and navigational aid equipment plans on waterways, the decision stipulates: 1. Dredge major ports and inland river channels, and improve major ports such as Yingkou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Fuzhou. In terms of inland rivers, dredge the East Stream shoals of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, the Sanxing shoals of the Songjiang River, and the Yingtian sandbars of the Xiangjiang River. The silted sections of the Grand Canal and the Suzhou Creek should be dredged as necessary. 2. The construction of lighthouses and signs should first restore the navigational aid equipment in the ports of the Bohai Bay and the Yangtze River route, as well as the Cao Feidian, Chengshantou, and Houjidao lighthouses, and the light beacons on the Yangtze River route, and improve the management system of lighthouses and signs. 3. The maintenance and repair of port wharves and warehouses should be the main focus. 4. Salvaging sunken ships and repairing old ships are the main tasks this year. 5. The construction of the Tanggu New Port project will continue. 6. Shipyards should focus on reorganizing internal management systems and improving work efficiency.

Regarding waterway management, the decision stipulates: 1. In order to overcome the phenomenon of disunity and strengthen the rectification and establishment of management systems in various ports and routes, and to uniformly manage the various waterway-related tasks in various ports, the Ministry of Communications will formulate uniform systems and regulations in conjunction with relevant departments, and implement them after being approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. 2. Simplify inland waterway navigation inspection procedures. Inspection agencies in various places should organize joint inspection stations at important berthing stations in conjunction with relevant departments to carry out joint inspections. Ships should not be intercepted or forced to stop during navigation to avoid unnecessary losses and dangers. Agencies and organizations in various places shall not issue free tickets or set freight rates without authorization. 3. Formulate ship inspection standards to ensure navigation safety. When state-owned and private shipping companies build or purchase new ships, they must be approved by the local waterway authorities; those over 200 tons must be approved by the Waterway General Bureau. 4. Train and educate pilots, improve their technical level, and improve the pilotage system. 5. Unify the operation of state-owned shipping businesses. All publicly owned ships and seagoing vessels and Yangtze River vessels over 500 tons operated by non-transportation departments shall be uniformly operated and managed by the State-owned Shipping Company, except those approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. Currently, it will be implemented first on the Beiyang and Yangtze River lines, and other routes may be temporarily entrusted to the major administrative regions and provinces for management. 6. Manage freight rates. There are too many current shipping freight rates, and the State-owned Shipping Company should study specific ways to reduce them.

Regarding the organizational leadership of waterways, the decision stipulates: 1. The Waterway General Bureau and the State-owned Shipping General Company are established under the Ministry of Communications to lead waterway construction and manage shipping operations. 2. Waterway Bureaus are established in major coastal ports and the Yangtze River; the distribution and jurisdiction of the Waterway Bureaus are as follows: Tianjin Waterway Bureau, with Yantai, Weihaiwei, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and Lianyungang Waterway Sub-bureaus; Yingkou Waterway Bureau, with Dalian and Andong Waterway Sub-bureaus; Shanghai Waterway Bureau, with Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen Waterway Sub-bureaus; Guangzhou Waterway Bureau, with Shantou, Haikou, Yulin Port, and Guangzhou Bay Waterway Sub-bureaus; Taiwan Waterway Bureau; Yangtze River Waterway Bureau, with Hankou, Nanjing, Chongqing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Shashi Waterway Sub-bureaus. The above-mentioned Waterway Bureaus all work under the direct leadership of the Waterway General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. 3. In order to unify shipping operations, the State-owned Shipping General Company is established in Shanghai (incorporating the business of the old China Merchants Steam Navigation Company) to uniformly manage state-owned shipping transportation operations.

In order to train waterway technical personnel, the decision stipulates that a waterway specialized school should be established, and an examination and assessment of senior crew members should be carried out universally this year.
