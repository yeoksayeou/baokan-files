Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th.  Salasvsky, in *Pravda*, published an article entitled "New Action of Aggressive American Foreign Policy," discussing the US government's severing of diplomatic relations with Bulgaria, stating: This decision by the United States is a completely blatant and unreasonable act of aggression by an imperialist power against a small democratic country. It has exposed to the world its unwillingness to abide by the basic principles established by treaties and the United Nations.

Salasvsky pointed out: During the trial of the Bulgarian traitor Kostov, it was revealed that the US Minister to Bulgaria, Heath, had engaged in criminal acts against the Bulgarian government. The Bulgarian government had, on January 19th, notified the US government to recall Heath, an action entirely in accordance with the rules of international relations. The US State Department, however, arrogantly demanded that Bulgaria withdraw this notification and threatened to sever diplomatic relations.

American imperialism has never abandoned its plan to make Bulgaria submit to its will. In August 1945, the US government rudely demanded that the Bulgarian National Assembly postpone its elections, a demand that failed. Subsequently, American and British imperialists attempted to intimidate this free country into submission to the United States and deprive it of its national sovereignty by accusing Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania of "violating human rights and religious freedom" in the United Nations. After the US government suffered another crushing defeat, it proposed the establishment of a special committee to investigate Bulgaria's so-called "violation of the treaty," attempting to use this as a pretext to reduce Bulgaria's national sovereignty. This clumsy diplomatic blackmail also failed. Later, US imperialism and its henchmen began to expand their network of espionage and sabotage within the People's Democratic countries. The trials of Rajk in Hungary and Kostov in Bulgaria exposed these activities.

US Undersecretary of State Webb shamelessly demanded that Bulgaria remove Heath's name from the indictment in the Kostov spy case. This was the most brutal pressure exerted on the independent court of an independent country. However, during the trial of the Shipkov spy case, it was once again proven that Heath personally directed this network of espionage and sabotage. After this, Heath could no longer serve as an envoy in any country that valued its sovereignty and national dignity. No free country can tolerate such shameless behavior by a foreigner.

Salasvsky concluded: American imperialism, dreaming of world hegemony, is simply unscrupulous in its attitude towards small democratic countries. They seem to think they are omnipotent and that the small democratic countries are defenseless. Having lost all sense of reality, they treat Bulgaria, which has bravely embarked on its own path, as a colony. However, the forces of peace are infinitely stronger than the forces of aggression, and Bulgaria is a member of the strong and united family of democratic peoples.

　　美帝侵略外交新行动
    真理报评美帝与保绝交
    【新华社北京五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：萨斯拉夫斯基在真理报上以《侵略性的美国外交政策之新行动》为题，撰文论述美国政府对保加利亚断绝外交关系称：美国这一决定，正是帝国主义大国对民主小国的一种完全露骨的、蛮不讲理的侵略行动。它已向全世界暴露出它不愿遵守和约及联合国所厘定的基本原则。
    萨斯拉夫斯基指出：在保加利亚叛国犯科斯托夫的审讯中，暴露出美国驻保公使希斯有反对保加利亚政府的犯罪行为。保国政府曾在一月十九日照会美国政府召回希斯，这一行动是完全符合国际关系的规则的。美国国务院却傲慢地要求保国撤回这一照会，而且威胁着要断绝外交关系。
    美帝国主义从未放弃使保加利亚服从其意志的计划。美国政府在一九四五年八月，曾无礼要求保国民议会选举延期举行，结果是失败了。其后，美英帝国主义者又企图以向联合国控告保、匈、罗“侵犯人权及宗教自由”为恫吓，迫使这个自由国家向美国屈膝，并剥夺其国家主权。在美国政府再次遭到惨败之后，它又建议成立专门委员会，调查保国所谓“侵犯和约”，企图借此削减保加利亚的国家主权。这种笨拙的外交讹诈也同样失败了。以后，美帝国主义和它的走卒，便在人民民主国家内开始扩大间谍与破坏网，匈牙利拉伊克案和保加利亚科斯托夫案的审讯，都暴露了这种活动。
    美国副国务卿韦伯曾无耻地要求保加利亚将希斯的名字从科斯托夫间谍案起诉书中除掉，这是对独立国家的独立法庭施行最粗暴的压力。但在这次西普考夫间谍案的审讯中，又一次证明希斯亲自指挥这一间谍与阴谋破坏网。此后，希斯再不能在任何珍视其主权及其国家尊严的国家中充任使节了。没有一个自由的国家能够容忍一个外国人这样无耻的行为。
    萨斯拉夫斯基结语称：梦想世界霸权的美帝国主义，对各民主小国的态度，简直是肆无忌惮的。他们似乎认为自己是万能的，而各民主小国则是没有防备的。在丧失了一切现实感之后，竟把勇敢走上自己道路的保加利亚当作殖民地看待。然而，和平的力量较之侵略的力量无比强大，而保加利亚则是民主人民坚强团结的大家庭中的一员。
