　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: The broad masses of the American people oppose the Truman government's policy of manufacturing atomic weapons and launching new wars, hoping that the United States and the Soviet Union will reach an agreement on the issue of controlling atomic weapons.

　　According to TASS, New York, 16th dispatch: The well-known American private organization - "American Institute of Public Opinion" - posed the following question to thousands of American citizens: "Do you think we should draw up an agreement with the Soviet Union to control atomic bombs?" Of the Americans who answered this question, 68 percent gave a positive response.

　　According to TASS, New York, 17th dispatch: Formal representatives of eleven national organizations in the United States issued an open letter to the press addressed to Truman, urging Truman to appoint a committee to clarify the most important issues raised by the decision to manufacture the hydrogen bomb. The letter stated: This committee "should consider all weapons of mass destruction from the perspective of a comprehensive foreign policy; it should clarify all possible courses of action and their political, economic and moral consequences, so that the public can make wise judgments." Signed on the letter were representatives of organizations such as the League of Women Voters, the Textile Workers Union of the CIO, the National Farmers Union, the National Women's Trade Union League, the Cooperative League of the USA, the International Association of Machinists of the AFL, the Federation of American Scientists, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs.

　　According to Electric News Agency, New York, 13th dispatch: The progressive newspaper "People's World" conducted a poll among church leaders in Seattle, the industrial center on the west coast of the United States. The survey showed that the vast majority of them opposed the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb. Among the leaders of each denomination surveyed, almost everyone expressed fear of weapons of mass destruction and called for major powers to reach an agreement to ban such weapons. A typical comment was that of Minister Shorter of the "People's Church," who said that American policy towards the Soviet Union was a "policy of the devil."

　　美广大人民反对制造氢弹
    要求与苏联成立协议
    【新华社十九日讯】美国广大人民反对杜鲁门政府制造原子武器，发动新战争的政策，希望美苏两国在管制原子武器问题上获致协议。
    据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国著名的私人组织——“美国舆论研究所”，曾向数千名美国公民提出下述问题：“你认为我们是否应该与苏联拟订一项管制原子弹的协定？”回答这个问题的美国人，有百分之六十八作了肯定的答复。
    另据塔斯社纽约十七日消息称：美国十一个全国性团体的正式代表，向报界发表致杜鲁门的公开信，敦促杜鲁门委任一个委员会，以廓清由于制造氢弹的决定所引起的最重要的问题。该函称：这个委员会“应该从全面的外交政策，来考虑一切大规模的破坏武器；应该阐明一切可能的行动方针及其政治的、经济的与道德的后果，俾公众可以作明哲的判断”。在信上签名的有：妇女选民同盟、产联纺织工人工会、全国农民联盟、全国妇女工会同盟、美国合作社同盟、劳联机械师国际协会、美国科学家联合会、妇女俱乐部总会等团体的代表。
    又据电通社纽约十三日讯：进步的报纸《人民世界》报在美国西岸工业中心西雅图的教会领袖间，举行了一次民意测验。测验显示出他们极大多数都反对制造氢弹。在被询问的每种教派领袖中，几乎每一个人都对大规模毁灭性武器表示恐惧，要求大国取得协议，禁止这种武器。典型的评论是“人民教会”牧师萧特尔的评论，他说：美国对苏政策是“魔鬼的政策”。
