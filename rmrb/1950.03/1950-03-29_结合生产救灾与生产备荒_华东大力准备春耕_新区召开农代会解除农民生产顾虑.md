Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th—Farmers in East China are currently vigorously preparing for spring plowing by combining production for disaster relief with production for famine preparedness. In the vast rural areas of the new districts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Southern Jiangsu, spring plowing production mobilization has been widely launched on the basis of mass movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing despots, reducing rent, and implementing reasonable burdens. Most areas of Zhejiang Province have already deployed production tasks around the Spring Festival by summarizing grain requisition work. In February, counties and districts in the province widely convened people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences to carry out production mobilization and specifically deploy and implement production tasks. For example, counties in the Jiande Special District of the province publicized policies through farmer representative conferences to dispel farmers' concerns about production and formulated plans to increase production. In Shiliang District, Qu County, a district and township production committee was established through a farmer representative conference. Under the promotion of the committee and local farmer representatives, the entire district launched a surge of repairing ponds, reclaiming wasteland, and accumulating fertilizer within eight days. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives in the province purchased farmers' local and special products for export, and the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China loaned 11.2 million catties of rice for agricultural production to solve farmers' production difficulties. From the end of last year to February of this year, the Fujian Provincial People's Government and its subordinate special districts successively convened production conferences to deploy spring plowing. Eighteen counties in Longxi and Nanping have successively formulated spring plowing plans through people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences. Fourteen counties, including Minhou and Longxi, have established water conservancy committees according to the plan, and have begun to open canals and repair dams, and have organized cooperatives to help poor farmers solve difficulties such as the lack of seeds. In the spring plowing preparation, organized farmers in twelve counties including Nanping have also effectively prevented illegal landlords from withdrawing land and slaughtering cattle, and other behaviors that damage production. Songjiang Special District in Southern Jiangsu and rice and cotton producing areas such as Changshu, Taicang, and Changzhou also generally convened production conferences in February to discuss production increase plans and deploy spring plowing. Many areas have begun to implement plans and spring plowing mobilization work to villages.

Old Liberated Areas Actively Organize Labor Exchange and Mutual Aid, Intensify Fertilizer Accumulation, Seed Selection, and Water Conservancy Construction

Farmers in the old liberated areas of Shandong and Northern Jiangsu are now actively organizing labor exchange and mutual aid, reorganizing land cultivation organizations, intensifying fertilizer accumulation, seed selection, and water conservancy construction. Farmers in various parts of Shandong have generally reorganized labor exchange groups and land cultivation organizations. Eight counties in the Nishan, Taishan, and Binhai Special Districts of the province have reorganized more than 7,400 mutual aid groups and newly organized more than 1,000 mutual aid groups. Most villages in the Jiaodong Beihai District have fixed land cultivation work by household. Counties and districts that have completed the reorganization of mutual aid organizations began spring plowing around the Awakening of Insects (the sixth of this month). On the work of accumulating fertilizer, farmers in the old liberated areas of Shandong generally have increased production enthusiasm due to land reform, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated this year generally exceeds that of previous years. According to a typical survey conducted by the Shandong Industrial Department in Nanying and Dazhuang villages in Licheng County, this year's spring fields can be fertilized with an average of seventeen carts of manure (350 catties per cart) per mu, which has reached the pre-war fertilization amount; many poor farmers have increased the amount of fertilizer accumulated due to the increase in livestock after land reform. In Yancheng Special District, Northern Jiangsu, 70% to 80% of the spring fields have been fertilized for the first time, with an average fertilization amount of about 5 dan per mu, and individual townships can reach 12 dan per mu, an increase of four times compared with previous years. At present, farmers in Yancheng Special District and more than ten counties including Taixing in Northern Jiangsu are continuing to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign. In addition, Northern Jiangsu is vigorously constructing water conservancy projects. In addition to mobilizing 300,000 river workers to carry out the diversion of the Yi (River) and dredging of the Shu (River) project, various places are also carrying out some small-scale water conservancy construction projects. More than ten rivers have been repaired and newly opened. In order to assist farmers in seed selection and improve farming techniques, the Jiaodong Administrative Office of Shandong and various special offices have established seed and medicine and machinery companies and seed stations in key counties to promote superior varieties. The Lunan Administrative Office has organized farms in various places to collect more than ten kinds of superior varieties of sorghum and millet and distribute them to various farms for breeding and promotion. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office recently purchased 10,000 dan of pure Dezi cotton seeds from various places, began distributing them in the cotton reclamation area, and continued to purchase them from outside to complete the task of promoting 300,000 mu of superior cotton seeds.

Disaster-stricken People Sow Early-Maturing Grains and Vegetables, Governments Distribute Seeds, Fertilizers, and Loans

In addition to vigorously carrying out sideline production and adopting the method of work-for-relief to construct water conservancy projects to solve the difficulties of food and seeds for the spring plowing period for the victims in disaster areas such as Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Anhui, local governments have issued a large number of agricultural loans, and are now actively organizing disaster victims to plant early-maturing grains and vegetables. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office has begun to lend seeds, fertilizers, plowing animals, and farm implements worth 18 million catties of rice to local disaster victims with a focus. Suxian Special District, where the disaster is more serious in the area, has lent out more than 1.9 million catties of grain and 4 million catties of grass, and has also decided to lend out 6.78 million catties of seeds to supply the seed needs of 7.2 million mu of land for severely affected households. In addition, Luan, Anqing, Chaohu and other special districts also support Suxian Special District with 80,000 catties of rapeseed, which is expected to plant 320,000 mu of vegetables. Under the call of planting more early-maturing grains and vegetables, a boom in planting spring vegetables has formed in the disaster areas of Northern Jiangsu. Huaiyin Special District requires each person to plant 100 to 200 catties of vegetables, and farmers in various townships have selected experienced farmers to plant vegetables as production committee members to promote vegetable planting work in various villages. A certain district in Siyang County has dug more than 1,500 mu of vegetable fields and is preparing to sow. The disaster areas in Southern Anhui also put forward the slogan "Each person plants two fen of rapeseed" and is preparing to sow a large amount.

　　结合生产救灾与生产备荒
    华东大力准备春耕
    新区召开农代会解除农民生产顾虑
    【新华社上海二十七日电】华东各地农民现正结合生产救灾与生产备荒，大力准备春耕。浙江、福建、苏南等新区广大农村，在剿匪、反恶霸、减租与贯彻合理负担等群众运动的基础上，春耕生产动员已广泛展开。浙江省大部地区已在春节前后通过总结征粮工作，将生产任务布置下去。二月份内该省各县、区又广泛召开了各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，进行生产动员，并具体布置贯彻生产任务。如该省建德专区各县通过农民代表会议宣传政策，解除农民对生产的顾虑，并订出了增产的计划。衢县石梁区通过农民代表会议成立了区乡生产委员会，在该委员会和当地农民代表的推动下，全区于八天内即展开了修塘、开荒、积肥的热潮。此外，该省供销合作社等收购农民土产特产运销出口，人民银行浙江省分行又贷出农业生产贷款米一千一百二十万斤，以解决农民生产上的困难。福建省人民政府和所属各专区自去年年底起至今年二月份已先后召开生产会议，布置春耕。该省龙溪、南平等十八县则相继通过各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议作出春耕计划，闽侯、龙溪等十四县已根据计划成立了水利委员会，着手开渠、修坝，并组织了合作社，帮助贫苦农民解决种子缺乏等困难。该省南平等十二个县有组织的农民在春耕准备中并曾有效地制止不法地主抽回土地、宰杀耕牛等破坏生产的行为。苏南松江专区及常熟、太仓、常州等产米、产棉地区在二月份内也普遍地召开了生产会议，讨论增产计划，布置春耕。有不少地区已开始将计划和春耕动员工作贯彻到村。
  老区积极组织变工互助  加紧积肥选种兴修水利
    山东、苏北老区的农民，现正在积极进行组织变工互助，整理代耕组织，加紧积肥、选种、兴修水利等工作。山东各地农民已普遍进行整理变工组和代耕组织。该省尼山、泰山、滨海三个专区八个县即已整理好互助组七千四百余个，新组织互助组一千余个。胶东北海区的大部村庄已将代耕工作按户固定。已将互助组织整理完毕的县区且在惊蛰（本月六日）前后就开始进行春耕。在积肥工作上，山东老区农民因经过土地改革，生产情绪普遍提高，今年的积肥量一般都超过往年。据山东实业厅在历城县南营、大庄两村的典型调查，今年的春田平均每亩能上十七车粪（每车三百五十斤），已达战前施肥量；其中有不少贫农都因土地改革后牲畜增加而增加了积肥量。苏北盐城专区已有百分之七十至八十的春田施过头遍肥，平均每亩施肥量约达五担，个别乡每亩可达十二担，较往年增加四倍。目前苏北盐城专区及泰兴等十余县的农民，正在继续展开积肥运动。此外，苏北并正在大力兴修水利，除已动员了三十万河工进行导沂（河）整沭（河）工程外，各地并同时进行一些小型水利建设，现已修竣与新开河流十余道。为协助农民选种及改良农作技术，山东胶东行署与各专署设立了种子、药械公司并在重点县设种子站，以推广优良品种。鲁中南行署已组织各地农场收集十余种高粱、谷子的优良品种分配给各农场繁殖推广。苏北行署最近自各地采购了德字棉纯种一万担，开始在棉垦区发放，并继续向外采购，以完成推广优良棉种三十万亩的任务。
    灾区群众播种早熟粮菜  政府发放种籽肥料贷款
    皖北、苏北、皖南等灾区目前除大力进行副业生产与采取以工代赈的方式兴修水利，以解决灾民春耕期间的口粮、种子等困难外，各地政府并发放了大量农贷，现在积极组织灾民种早熟粮菜。皖北行署已开始以价值一千八百万斤大米的种子、肥料、耕畜、农具等，有重点地贷给当地灾民。该区灾情较重的宿县专区除已贷出粮食一百九十余万斤，草四百万斤外，还决定贷放种子六百七十八万斤，以供应重灾户七百二十万亩地的种子需要量。此外，六安、安庆、巢湖等专区亦以八万斤菜籽支援宿县专区，预计可种菜三十二万亩。在多种早熟粮菜的号召下，苏北灾区种春菜已形成热潮，淮阴专区要求每人种菜一百斤到二百斤，各乡农民并选出种菜有经验的农民为生产委员，以便推动各村种菜工作。泗阳县某区已挖好一千五百余亩菜地，准备下种。皖南灾区也提出“每人种二分地油菜”的口号，准备大量播种。
