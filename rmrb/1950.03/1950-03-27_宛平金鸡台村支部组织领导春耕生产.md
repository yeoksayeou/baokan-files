　　Wanping Jinjitai Village Branch Organizes and Leads Spring Plowing Production

　　The Jinjitai Village Branch of the Fourth District of Wanping County, Hebei Province, is a model branch with achievements in leading production. Last summer, at the county's production conference, Jinjitai Village was rated as a top-class production model village and received a large red flag. On the "July 1st" anniversary, it was also rated as a model branch in the county and received a certificate of merit from the Provincial Party Committee and award flags from the County and District Party Committees.

　　During the Spring Festival this year, the branch held a meeting of party members and invited the masses to participate in discussing the 1950 production plan. The branch was not satisfied with last year's production achievements. After the deputy secretary reported on last year's production summary, everyone conducted a comprehensive and in-depth review of last year's production leadership. Many issues were raised at the meeting, which greatly helped with this year's production plan. For example, the branch did not respect the opinions of non-Party cadres such as the chairman of the farmers' association enough, which made them feel down, and the work teams they led also collapsed. Insufficient patient mobilization, persuasion, and education of the masses were also noted. For example, when weeding last year, several women, including Liu Meihua, Liu Shuying, and Ren Laomian, did not participate in weeding. The cadres did not patiently persuade and mobilize them but criticized them in the wall newspaper. As a result, these women not only refused to go to the fields but also became stubborn with the cadres and simply refused to work. At the same time, the creation of experience by Party members to educate the masses and promote the entire village was not done enough. For example, during the spring drought last year, branch committee member Zhang Guangren took the lead in organizing water carrying and planting, but the cadres did not promptly summarize this method to promote the entire village to learn from it, so not many households were motivated. Also, last year's winter production was indeed a great success, with the total income from various side occupations in the village amounting to more than 1,000 shi of coarse grains (an average of more than nine dou of grain per person), implementing the county party committee's call to "not eat the autumn harvest grain this winter." But in terms of leadership, it was not comprehensive and in-depth enough, and the organization was not specific enough. Currently, there are still eighteen households in the village without labor power who have difficulties with spring plowing and cannot solve them. In terms of substitute cultivation, the education of the masses is insufficient, and some people are not active in doing substitute cultivation work in the fields; on the other hand, some military families still have a sense of dependency.

　　After this review, all Party members were determined to lead this year's production work well and ensure the completion of the 1950 task. More than ninety Party members carefully calculated and formulated their own specific plans and, based on these plans, formulated the village's production plan, guaranteeing that the village will increase grain production by 311 shi this year. More than ninety Party members guaranteed to lead two or three households each through practical actions and persuasion and education, and under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit to develop mutual aid and strive to organize 80 percent of the village's male and female labor force. Women's Federation Director Tan Guoqin also guaranteed to mobilize women who did not participate in labor in previous years to join groups and engage in agricultural labor, so that male laborers could go to Mentougou to sell labor in a planned way. The organization forms, fertilization, manure accumulation, seed soaking, and substitute cultivation were also discussed and stipulated.

　　After the branch meeting, Party members took the lead in mobilizing the masses to organize themselves. Women's Federation Director Tan Guoqin organized 45 women to participate in the work exchange group through door-to-door conversations (twelve groups have been organized). From the tenth day of the first lunar month, they began to exchange work to deliver manure. In five days, the twelve groups of women delivered more than 1,800 baskets of manure. Fourteen groups of male laborers (more than sixty people) also began to exchange work to go to the fields. All the groups and households in the village put forward conditions to compete with each other: compare manure piles in the spring, crops in the summer, and grain in the autumn. Village Chief Dong Fengmei, Branch Secretary Dong Fengchen, and others said at the mass meeting and the meeting of revolutionary martyrs, military families, and workers' families: "Our village was a production model village last year and won a big red flag. This year, let's all work hard and have the confidence and determination to win the second award flag."

### 宛平金鸡台村支部组织领导春耕生产

　　宛平金鸡台村支部组织领导春耕生产
    河北宛平县四区金鸡台村支部是个领导生产有成绩的模范支部。去年夏季，在全县的生产大会上，金鸡台村被评为头等生产模范村，得了一面大红旗。“七一”纪念，又被评为全县的模范支部，得到了省委的奖状和县委、区委的奖旗。
    今年春节时，支部召开了党员大会并邀请群众参加，讨论一九五○年的生产计划。支部并不满足于去年的生产成绩，在副支书报告了去年的生产总结后，大家对去年的生产领导作了全面的深刻的检查。会上提出了不少问题，对今年的生产计划帮助很大。如支部对非党干部如农会主任等的意见不够尊重，使得他们情绪低落，被他们所领导的拨工组也垮台了。对群众的耐心动员说服教育不够，如去年锄地时有刘梅花、刘淑英、任老棉等几个妇女不参加锄地，干部们没有耐心地说服动员，就在墙报上批评，结果这些妇女非但不肯上地，反而和干部们蹩上了劲，索性就更不劳动了。同时以党员带头，创造经验，教育群众，推动全村也做的不够。如去年春旱时，支委张广仁带头组织了担水点种，但干部们没有及时总结这一办法以推动全村群众学习，所以带动起的户数并不多。又如去年的冬季生产，成绩确实不小，全村各种副业总计收入粗粮一千多石（每人平均九斗多粮食），执行了县委“今冬不吃秋收粮”的号召。但就领导说，还不够全面深入，组织还不够具体。现在全村还有十八户无劳动力的户，春耕有困难而无法解决。代耕方面，对群众教育不够，有些人到地里做代耕活不积极；另一面有些军属也还有依赖思想。
    经过这番检查，全体党员决心要领导好今年的生产工作，保证完成一九五○年的任务。九十多个党员都精打细算的订出了自己的具体计划，并以这些计划作根据，订出了全村的生产计划，保证全村今年增产粮食三百一十一石。九十多个党员保证以实际行动和说服教育的方式，每人带动两三户群众，在自愿两利的原则下开展拨工互助，争取全村男女劳动力百分之八十组织起来。妇联主任谭国琴也保证动员往年不参加劳动的妇女入组担任农业劳动，使男劳力有计划地到门头沟去卖工。关于组织形式、施肥、积肥、浸种、代耕等也都讨论及规定了办法。
    支部会议后，以党员为骨干带动群众先后组织起来。妇联主任谭国琴以串门拉话的方式，组织了四十五个妇女参加了拨工组（已组织了十二组）。从旧历正月初十后，就开始拨工送粪，五天中十二组妇女共送粪一千八百余篓子。男劳力十四组（六十余人）也开始拨工下地。全村组与组、户与户都提出条件互相比赛：春天比粪堆，夏天比庄稼，秋天比粮食。村长董逢梅、支书董丰臣等在群众大会上和烈、军、工属会上说：“咱们村去年是生产模范村，得了大红旗，今年咱们大家好好努力，有信心，有决心再争取第二面奖旗到手”。
