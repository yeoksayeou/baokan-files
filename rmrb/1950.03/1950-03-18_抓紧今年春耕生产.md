　　Seize the Opportunity for Spring Plowing and Production This Year

The first spring plowing and production campaign is about to begin on the free new mainland of China. This year's national agricultural production plan calls for an increase of 10 billion jin of grain and 4.7 million dan of cotton over 1949. This is the overall goal of the struggle on this year's agricultural front. Local people's governments at all levels, the People's Liberation Army without combat missions, rural local party organizations and all rural party members at all levels, and the broad masses of farmers should immediately mobilize from now on and enthusiastically carry out spring plowing and production work. At present, all rural work should be carried out around the overriding central task of spring plowing and production.

This year's general policy for national agricultural production is to focus on recovery. In old areas, agricultural production should generally increase by 10% compared to the 1949 production level; in old areas with better conditions, agricultural production should strive to restore pre-war levels. In new areas, the general requirement is to maintain the 1949 production level, and in new areas with better conditions, strive for a slight increase. Disaster areas are required to achieve self-reliance in production, ensure timely sowing, and not leave an acre of land uncultivated.

The basic links in leading this year's spring plowing and production: In the new areas, the main task is to stabilize rural production sentiment and stabilize social production order. The key in all new areas is to thoroughly publicize and explain and correctly implement the Central People's Government's policies on land reform, public grain collection, and spring plowing production in the new areas. Even in bandit suppression areas, bandit suppression work should be combined with the above-mentioned work. In the old areas, the main tasks are to universally and thoroughly organize the labor force, improve agricultural technology, and publicize and explain the agricultural tax policies that reward increased production. In disaster areas, the main task is to plan for spring plowing food rations, seeds, and livestock protection under the policy of production self-reliance. By grasping these basic links, we can do a good job in this year's spring plowing and production.

This year, agricultural production in the newly liberated areas is of particular importance. Because the newly liberated areas have a population of about 300 million and more than 800 million mu of cultivated land, the cultivated area in the new areas accounts for about 57% of the 1.4 billion mu of cultivated land in the country. The most important rice-producing areas in the country are all in the newly liberated areas. The total grain output of the new areas is greater than that of the old areas. However, the most problems and the most complex situations in this year's agricultural production are in the new areas.

The basic situation in the rural areas of the newly liberated areas is: the reform of land distribution has not yet been possible to implement immediately, and landlords and peasants in the new areas also know that land reform will inevitably be implemented. Therefore, the landlords have a wait-and-see attitude, and the peasants are waiting for the distribution of land. In addition, the task of collecting public grain in the autumn of 1949 was heavy, and some deviations occurred in the implementation of the public grain collection policy in some places, which made many people in the new areas afraid to produce with peace of mind. Therefore, the State Council of the Central People's Government specially issued instructions on land reform and public grain collection in the new liberated areas on February 28, clearly announcing our land reform policy and burden policy in the new areas in order to stabilize people's hearts. The instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on spring plowing and production on March 15 further explained in concrete terms our rural policies in the new areas. Therefore, the main task of this year's spring plowing and production work in the new areas is to publicize and implement the policies of the Central People's Government towards all classes in the rural areas, so that they "know what to expect" in order to produce with peace of mind. Here, the policy towards the peasants comes first. The People's Government provides practical guarantees for the interests of the peasants, even when the reform of land distribution has not been implemented: First, guaranteeing the implementation of rent reduction; second, guaranteeing that they can harvest the land they rent; third, the peasants' original land, whether now or in the future, will be owned by the peasants and can be freely bought and sold without being violated. Secondly, the following provisions have also been made for the landlords: First, before the land distribution reform is implemented, the land of the landlords still belongs to the landlords. Second, after the landlords legally reduce rent, they can legally collect rent from the peasants, and the peasants should pay rent legally. Third, if the landlord has a self-cultivated portion, he is also guaranteed the right to harvest. This harvest and the rent collected after legally reducing the rent will not be confiscated and distributed in the future land distribution. In addition, it guarantees the freedom of borrowing relations established after liberation; and stipulates that employment relations are not prohibited now or in the future. For land that has increased production due to diligent cultivation and technical improvement, the burden of grain requisition will not be increased. The waste of land and destructive behavior are strictly prohibited, and those who waste land and destroy it must be punished. As for the shortcomings and mistakes of uneven burdens that occurred in the collection of public grain in 1949 by the people's governments in various places, they must be effectively corrected and remedied.

This is the basic policy of the Central People's Government for the rural areas of the new areas before the implementation of land distribution in the new areas. This policy is completely in line with the greatest interests of the broad masses of people in the new areas, and all localities must implement it effectively without any wavering. However, implementing this policy requires arduous work. Because the masses in the new areas do not have the political experience of the old areas, and our cadres in the new areas cannot catch up with the contact between the cadres and the masses in the old areas in a short time, the social order is not as stable as in the old areas, the number of cadres is small, and the tasks are heavy. These conditions make it easy for cadres in the new areas to relax the leadership of spring plowing and production, or to lead it in a not timely manner, and to engage in "single-handedly" bandit suppression, land reform preparation work, or public grain collection work. This possibility must be prevented. Because if the work of spring plowing and production is relaxed, it will inevitably lead to a serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses, and may cause great danger to the national and new area grain supply in 1951. That is to say, if we relax this year's production work in the new areas, it will cause us new serious difficulties.

This year's focus on increasing agricultural production is in the old areas.

In the old liberated areas, because the feudal land system has been fundamentally eliminated, the production enthusiasm of the peasants is generally high, and they are eager to increase production. In some places, land prices have risen to levels unprecedented in decades, and fertilizers on the market are often snapped up by farmers. According to statistics from the former North China People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture, the number of waterwheels sold in North China in 1949 increased tenfold compared to 1948. These are all new atmospheres in the countryside after the land reform. However, in a few areas, due to the deviation of infringing on the interests of middle peasants in the past land reform, it has not been completely resolved to this day. In some places, land certificates have not yet been issued. In addition, the long-term lack of democratic life in certain rural work has made some people not fully understand the policy of the People's Government and the Communist Party to develop production, and they still have some concerns about getting rich through labor. Some still have the lazy idea of ​​taking "poverty" as "glory" and not engaging in production. These wrong ideas are obstacles to the development of production in the old areas and must be educated to the peasants and completely eliminated.

The high production enthusiasm of the peasants in the old areas is a favorable condition for this year's spring plowing and production. However, the road for further development of peasants in the old areas is still to continue to implement the policy of "getting organized". This is the avenue for peasants with a scattered individual economy to get rich through labor. It is completely wrong for a few local cadres and peasants to think that the revolution has been successful and that mutual assistance in production is no longer necessary. All old liberated areas must strengthen leadership on the basis of existing production organizations, and more widely develop various production mutual assistance organizations under the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. At the same time, cooperatives should be universally and systematically established and strengthened, and the state trade organs should be linked with a large number of cooperatives through a contract system, and closely combined with labor mutual assistance organizations, so that the rural individual economy can widely and gradually move towards the road of collectivization through cooperatives. In addition, all localities should conscientiously implement the price policy of agricultural products and ensure reasonable parity prices for farmers' main agricultural industrial raw material crops in a certain quantity and a certain specification for public grain. All of this is the road to economically strengthen mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and the worker-peasant alliance.

The second problem of production in the old areas is the problem of improving agricultural technology, among which the first is the problem of water conservancy. The Central People's Government has already carried out huge water conservancy work in the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and Jidong, Suixi, Lunan, Huaihe and other places this year. All localities - whether mountainous or plains - should seize this work and prevent the occurrence of all drought and flood dangers in a prepared manner. Secondly, it is the selection of seeds, fertilization, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, prevention of plant diseases and insect pests, development of animal husbandry, prevention of animal epidemics, and afforestation, etc. In this regard, we must resolutely adopt successful experiences and possible advanced agricultural technologies in our agricultural production.

The third problem in the spring plowing production in the old areas should be to vigorously publicize the burden policy and price policy stipulated by the Central People's Government. According to the instructions of the State Council: "Public grain should be collected in proportion to the normal annual yield of the land, that is, the portion that is increased due to diligent cultivation and good organization will not be collected." That is, the government does not increase their burden for any income increased due to the efforts of the peasants.

In parts of the old areas where land certificates have not yet been issued, they should be issued quickly before the spring plowing. In areas where land reform has been completed but land certificates cannot be issued in time, the land ownership should be announced and determined first, and other unresolved problems left over from the past land reform should be resolutely and appropriately resolved in order to achieve the purpose of consolidating the unity of the rural people and producing with one heart.

All disaster areas should seize the opportunity for spring plowing and production, which is the fundamental way to shorten the disaster period and overcome the famine. There are more difficulties in production in disaster areas, but they should be resolutely overcome. Among them, the first is the problem of food rations during spring plowing. The governments of all disaster areas should lead the people in the disaster areas to earnestly plan for seeds and livestock feed to ensure spring plowing. The Central People's Government attaches great importance to production in disaster areas and has already taken out possible and sufficient material resources to support disaster areas. As long as all localities are good at organizing and using this force, they will surely be able to guarantee the victorious completion of this year's spring plowing.

Regarding the leadership of spring plowing and production, the basic method is to mobilize labor heroes and production models among farmers to take the lead through people's representative conferences and farmers' representative conferences at all levels. This is an effective method to overcome the empiricism and petty-minded work style in past production work, adopt a large-scale mass line work style, and overcome blindness and conservative thinking in production. Local production plans should be in line with reality and oppose all subjectivism and coercive commandism. Old and new areas, pastoral and agricultural areas, cotton-growing and non-cotton-growing areas, disaster and non-disaster areas, lightly and severely affected areas, etc., should have different production plans and requirements. However, all plans must implement the general policy of restoring or at least maintaining production. In order to realize this year's agricultural production plan, a series of propaganda and mobilization work, organizational work, and inspection work must be carried out across the country. Leading organs at all levels should get rid of all non-urgent work and concentrate all their efforts on spring plowing! Strive for the victory of this year's spring plowing campaign.

### 抓紧今年春耕生产

　　抓紧今年春耕生产
    在自由的新中国大陆上，第一个春耕生产运动就要到来了。今年全国农业生产计划要求在一九四九年的基础上增产粮食一百亿斤，增产棉花四百七十万担。这是今年农业战线上斗争的总目标。各级地方人民政府、没有战斗任务的人民解放军、各级农村地方党组织和所有农村党员、以及广大农民群众，从现在起，应立即动员起来，热烈地进行春耕生产工作。目前，一切农村工作都应当围绕着春耕生产这一压倒一切的中心任务来进行。
    今年全国农业生产的总方针是以恢复为主。在老区农业生产一般应较一九四九年生产水平提高一成；在条件较好的老区，农业生产应争取恢复战前水平。在新区，则一般要求保持一九四九年生产水平，条件较好的新区，争取略加提高。灾区则要求生产自救，保证按时下种，不荒一亩地。
    领导今年春耕生产的基本环节：在新区，主要是安定农村生产情绪，安定社会生产秩序。其关键，在一切新区，主要是深入宣传解释与正确执行中央人民政府对新区土地改革、征收公粮与对于春耕生产的各项政策。即在剿匪地区，亦应将剿匪工作与上述工作结合进行。在老区，主要是普遍深入地组织劳动力、改良农业技术与宣传解释奖励增产的农业税收政策。在灾区主要是在生产自救的方针之下，筹划春耕的口粮、籽种与保护牲畜。抓紧了这些基本环节，就可以搞好今年的春耕生产。
    今年农业生产中，新解放区有特别重要的意义。因为新解放区有三万万左右的人口，有八万万亩以上的耕地，新区耕地面积约占全国耕地面积十四万万亩的百分之五十七。全国最主要的产米区都在新解放区。新区粮食总产量，多于老区。而今年农业生产中，问题最多、情况最复杂的是在新区。
    新解放区农村现在的基本情况是：分配土地的改革还没有条件立即实行，而新区地主与农民也都知道，土地的改革必然要实行。于是地主存在着观望心理，农民等待着分配土地，加以一九四九年秋季征收公粮任务较重，而在执行征收公粮的政策上有些地方又发生了些偏差，遂使不少新区人民不敢放心生产。因此，中央人民政府政务院特于二月二十八日发布了新解放区土地改革及征收公粮的指示，把我们在新区的土地改革政策与负担政策明白宣布，以安定人心。三月十五日中央人民政府政务院关于春耕生产的指示，又进一步具体地说明了我们在新区的农村政策。因此，今年新区春耕生产工作，主要任务就是宣传与执行中央人民政府对农村各阶级的政策，使他们“心里有数”，以便放心生产。这里首先是对于农民的政策。人民政府对于农民的利益，即在未实行分配土地的改革时，也有切实的保障：第一，保障实行减租；第二，保障所租种的土地由自己收获；第三；农民原有的土地不论现在与将来均为农民所有，并得自由买卖，不受侵犯。其次，对于地主方面也作了如下的规定：第一，在实行分配土地改革前，地主的土地仍归地主所有。第二，地主在依法实行减租后，得依法向农民收租，农民则应依法缴租。第三，地主如有自耕部分，同样保障他收获的权利。此种收获及依法减租后的收租部分，在今后实行土地分配时均不在没收分配之列。此外，则是保障解放后成立的自由借贷关系；并规定现在和将来均不禁止雇佣关系。对于因勤劳耕作及技术改良而增产的土地，征粮时不增加负担。对于荒芜土地与破坏行为则一律禁止，并须给荒地者与破坏者以处分。至于各地人民政府在征收一九四九年公粮中所发生的畸轻畸重的缺点和错误，则须进行切实的纠正与补救。
    这是中央人民政府在新区实行分配土地以前对新区农村的基本政策。这个政策是完全符合于新区广大人民群众的最大利益的，各地必须切实执行，不得丝毫动摇。但执行这一个政策需要经过艰苦的工作。因为新区群众没有老区的政治经验，而我们在新区的干部与群众的联系又一时赶不上老区，社会秩序又没有老区安定，干部数量少，任务又重。这些条件，使新区干部很容易放松春耕生产的领导，或者领导得不及时，而“单打一”地搞剿匪、土地改革准备工作或征收公粮工作，这种可能必须防止。因为如果放松了春耕生产工作，必然造成脱离群众的严重现象，而且对于一九五一年的全国与新区粮食供应可能造成极大的危险。这就是说，如果放松了新区今年的生产工作，将造成我们新的严重困难。
    今年农业增产的重点在老区。
    在老解放区，由于已根本上消灭了封建土地制度，农民生产情绪是一般高涨的，他们迫切要求增加生产。有些地方，地价上涨为几十年来所未有，市场上的肥料，往往被农民抢购一光。据前华北人民政府农业部统计，一九四九年华北地区推销水车数较一九四八年增加十倍。这都是土改结束后农村的新气象。但也有少数地区，由于在过去土地改革中，曾发生过侵犯中农利益的偏向，至今还没有彻底解决。有些地方，土地证至今尚未发完。加以某些农村工作中长期缺乏民主生活等，致使某些群众不完全了解人民政府与共产党发展生产的政策，对劳动致富仍存有某些顾虑，有的还残存着以“穷”为“光荣”，不事生产的懒汉思想。这些错误思想是老区发展生产的障碍，必须教育农民，彻底肃清。
    老区农民高度生产热情是今年春耕生产的有利条件。但是，老区农民进一步发展的道路，仍是继续贯彻“组织起来”的政策，这是分散的个体经济的农民劳动致富的康庄大道。少数地方干部与农民以为革命已经成功，生产互助已无必要，这是十分错误的。所有老解放区，必须在现有的生产组织的基础上，加强领导，在自愿两利的原则下更广泛地发展各种生产互助的组织，同时应该普遍地系统地建立和加强合作社，用合同制度把国家贸易机关与大量的合作社联系起来，并与劳动互助组织密切结合，使农村个体经济经过合作社广泛地与逐渐地走向集体化的道路。此外，各地还要认真执行农产品的价格政策，保证农民的主要农产工业原料作物在一定数量和一定规格顶交公粮的合理比价。这一切都是经济上加强城乡互助与工农联盟的道路。
    老区生产的第二个问题是改良农业技术问题，其中，首先是水利问题。中央人民政府今年已在黄河长江以及冀东、绥西、鲁南、淮河等地进行着巨大的水利工作。各地——不论山地和平原均应抓紧这一项工作，预有准备地防止一切旱涝危险的发生。其次，则是选种、施肥、深耕细作、防止病虫害、发展畜养、防止兽疫以及植树造林等，在这方面要坚决采用我们农业生产中成功的经验与可能的进步的农业技术。
    老区春耕生产中第三个问题，应大力宣传中央人民政府所规定的负担政策和价格政策。按照政务院指示：“公粮应按土地常年应产量比例征收，即不征收其因勤劳耕作和善于组织而增产的部分。”即凡因农民努力生产而增加的收入，政府并不增加他们的负担。
    在部分老区尚未颁发土地证的，要在春耕前迅速发下，已完成土地改革的地区而不能及时发土地证的，应先宣布确定地权，并坚决地与适当地解决过去土地改革中所遗留的其他未解决的问题，以达巩固地团结农村人民齐心生产的目的。
    一切灾区更应当抓紧春耕生产，这是缩短灾期，渡过灾荒的根本办法。灾区生产，困难较多，但应坚决加以克服。其中，首先是春耕中的口粮问题，各灾区政府应领导灾区人民切实筹划籽种，牲畜草料等，以保证春耕。中央人民政府对灾区生产异常重视，已经拿出可能与足够的物质力量支援灾区，只要各地善于组织与运用这个力量，就一定能够保证今年春耕的胜利完成。
    关于春耕生产的领导，基本方法是通过各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议，动员农民中的劳动英雄与生产模范起带头作用。这是克服过去生产工作中经验主义与小手小脚的作风，采取大规模的群众路线作风，以及克服生产上盲目性和保守思想的有效方法。各地生产计划要切合实际，反对一切主观主义和强迫命令作风。老区与新区、牧畜区与农业区、植棉区与非植棉区、灾区与非灾区、轻灾区与重灾区等，在生产计划与要求上均应有所不同。但一切计划都必须要贯彻恢复至少维持生产的总方针。为了实现今年农业生产计划，须要在全国进行一系列的宣传鼓动工作，组织工作以及检查工作。各级领导机关应摆脱一切非当务之急的工作，集中全力投入春耕中去！争取今年春耕运动的胜利。
