Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: Luo Longji, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the China Democratic League, published a written statement in Beijing's Guangming Daily today, refuting U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's March 15th speech entitled "U.S. Policy Toward Asia." Luo Longji first pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson knows that "actions speak louder than words," yet he still hopes to use what he considers beautiful words to cover up the many unattractive, ugly, and criminal behaviors of the United States in the past and present, in order to deceive the people of all Asia and the people of the world. Luo Longji then pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. imperialists, as exposed in Acheson's speech, is: first, to keep Southeast Asia as a colony of the imperialists forever; second, to use Southeast Asia to achieve the goal of opposing the Soviet Union, communism, and the people.

Luo Longji said: The Chinese People's Revolution has been victorious. The U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression against China has completely failed. Now China and the Soviet Union have become sincere brotherly allies. Therefore, Acheson felt infinite sorrow and jealousy.

Referring to the Southeast Asian issue, Luo Longji said: Acheson knows that "a new era has fully unfolded in Asia." He knows that this new era is created by two thoughts of the Asian people: one, "the Southeast Asian people abhor living in poverty and oppression," and two, "the Southeast Asian people dislike foreign rule." May I ask: Who is responsible for this suffering of the Southeast Asian people? Isn't this the crime of the imperialists? Luo Longji continued: Then, isn't Acheson's ranting, Acheson's so-called concern and help for the Southeast Asian people, a "hypocritical tears" deception? Luo Longji finally said: Simply put, the choice of the Southeast Asian people today is between these two destinies: on the one hand, national liberation, true freedom and equality for the nation; on the other hand, being a colony forever, being oppressed by imperialism forever. The Southeast Asian people, like the Chinese people, will definitely choose the first destiny, not the second. Their future victory and success will certainly be like the victory and success of the Chinese People's Revolution.

[Our Newspaper] Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, issued a written statement, stating briefly: "After reading the full text of Acheson's 'Policy Toward Asia' speech, I feel that it is completely an Ah Q-style ranting, a loser's lament. Except for Quirino, Syngman Rhee, Hatta, Bao Dai, and others who will praise and applaud, all international people who love peace and democracy will recognize Acheson's shamelessness and sophistry." He also said: "The 475 million Chinese people have stood up, and 800 million people in the world have united closely. The fists of 800 million people have built the strongest peace fortress in the world, and they will not allow you to mess around like this. Your dream of keeping East Asia in a colonial state will never be realized."

　　罗隆基彭泽民发表谈话
    痛斥艾奇逊无耻叫嚣
    “猫哭耗子”的欺骗挡不住东南亚人民革命的胜利。
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国民主同盟宣传委员会主任委员罗隆基今日在北京光明日报发表书面谈话，驳斥美国国务卿艾奇逊三月十五日发表的题为“美国对亚洲的政策”的演说。罗隆基首先指出：美国国务卿艾奇逊明知“行动是较言论更为响亮”，他却仍然希望用自以为漂亮的言论以掩饰美国过去和现在许多不漂亮的、丑恶的、而且罪恶的行为，以欺骗全亚洲人民和全世界人民。罗隆基接着指出艾奇逊演词中所暴露的美帝国主义者的目的是：第一，保持东南亚永远做帝国主义者们的殖民地；第二，利用东南亚来达到反苏反共反人民的目的。
    罗隆基说：中国的人民革命胜利了。美帝国主义者的对华侵略政策彻底失败了。如今中苏两大国又成了真诚的兄弟盟友。于是艾奇逊发生了无限的悲戚与嫉妒。
    在谈及东南亚问题时，罗隆基说：艾奇逊知道“一个新的时代已在亚洲全面展开了”。他知道这种新时代是亚洲人民两种思想所造成：一、“东南亚人民厌恶生活贫困的压迫”，二、“东南亚人民嫌恶外国的统治”。试问：东南亚人民这种痛苦是谁的责任呢？这不是帝国主义者们的罪恶吗？罗隆基接着说：那么，艾奇逊的叫嚣，艾奇逊所谓的对东南亚人民的关怀与帮助，不是“猫哭耗子”的欺骗吗？罗隆基最后说：简单说来，今天东南亚人民的选择，是这样的两种命运：一方面是民族解放，是民族的真正的自由平等；另一方面是永远做殖民地，是永远受帝国主义压迫。东南亚人民正如中国人民一样，他们的选择一定是第一种命运，而不是第二种。他们将来的胜利与成功，一定是如中国人民革命的胜利与成功一样。
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党监察委员会主席彭泽民发表书面谈话，略称：“我看了艾奇逊‘对亚洲政策’演说的全文后，觉得完全是一种阿Ｑ式的叫嚣，是失败者的悲鸣。除了季里诺、李承晚、哈达、保大等会称赞叫好外，凡是爱好和平民主的国际人士都会认识艾奇逊的无耻和强辩。”又称：“四万万七千五百万的中国人民已经站起来了，世界上八万万的人民已经紧密的团结在一起，八万万人的拳头已经筑起世界上最坚强的和平堡垒，他不会容许你们这样胡搞的。你想使东亚继续停留在殖民地状态的美梦，是永远不会实现的。”
