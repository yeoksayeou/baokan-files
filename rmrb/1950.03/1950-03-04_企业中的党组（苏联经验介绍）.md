　　Party Groups in Enterprises
    (Introduction of Soviet Experience)
    In a letter to Comrade Stalin, the laborers of Chelyabinsk Oblast pledged the socialist obligation to complete the production level of the Five-Year Plan in three and a half years. The successful fulfillment of this obligation is inconceivable without raising the political awareness of the masses and the work of Party organizations.

    Party groups (equivalent to subgroups within Chinese Communist Party branches - Editor) play a significant role in completing economic and political tasks. They influence every worker in the workshop or team. The 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) required that the focus of Party work be truly shifted to the workshops and teams, that is, to the workshops that directly determine the fate of the plan. Now, as the entire people strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and to improve the quality indicators in industrial work, the demands on Party groups are also increasing.

    Party groups should exert an effective influence on the work of their workshops, quickly grasp and disseminate all new and advanced things, analyze and strive to eliminate shortcomings, and influence those who are lazy.

    The Party group of the smelting workshop of the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant discusses every incident that violates labor and technical discipline. After shift changes, the Party group often holds meetings for fifteen to twenty minutes to discuss urgent issues. The active work of the Party group and the correct allocation of cadres have helped the workshop not only exceed the plan for the first quarter of 1949, but also reach the production level of 1950.

    By effectively promoting production and carrying out work to the end, Party groups consolidate the confidence of the masses in their own strength and expand their ties with non-Party members. Wherever a Party group advocates and insists on work, its prestige must be very high. Every non-Party worker will bring any problem he encounters to the Party group, to be handled by Communists and Party organizers.

    Advanced Party groups pay great attention to popularizing and disseminating all new things. These new things are created by laborers in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They search for and adopt the most effective forms of socialist competition in their own workshops, and actively and persistently disseminate advanced methods of organizing production. The struggle for higher quality and surplus production and the struggle to save raw materials are fundamental issues. Party groups organize their production work around these issues and educate Communists on these issues.

    Many defective products were produced in the workshops of the Chelyabinsk Transport Machine Manufacturing Plant. Comrade Alekseyev, the leader of the Party group, organized three teams called "Excellent Quality Teams" to compete with each other. A technical research team was established, and the Party group supervised its progress daily. The Communists quickly enabled each team to produce only high-quality products. Now, the task of creating excellent quality workshops has been proposed.

    The Party group of the equipment workshop of the Ural Automobile Plant—where the Party group leader is Comrade Kozlov—proposed the task of enabling each worker in the workshop to master two or three specialized skills. Unskilled workers approached Communists who helped them familiarize themselves with new skills. Surov had no specialized skills when he came to the factory from the Soviet army. Comrade Bubnov helped him become a cutting worker in two months. The research in the technical research team that supplemented the work gave positive results. The abilities of all workers have significantly improved. The workshop began to work very well. The workers themselves put forward many rationalization proposals, which were implemented with the help of the workshop's engineers and technicians.

    The power of personal example is particularly convincing. Therefore, Party groups pay much attention to enhancing the vanguard role of Communists, educating them to have organizational skills, and improving their political and ideological level and production capacity.

    Party groups care about improving the political level of each Communist, cultivating their interest in independent study of books, and educating them to have an inherent requirement to systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory. Where all Communists in a Party group study in the Party education network, there are usually better production achievements.

    All members and alternate members of one of the Party groups of the Ordzhonikidze Plant in Chelyabinsk Oblast are studying. Comrade Kovalev, the Party group organizer, systematically supervises the content studied by the Communists and records the achievements of the study in his diary. Every kind of lesson must be discussed and approved by the Party group.

    A sound propaganda work has been established in the workshop where the Party group is located. Communists are active propagandists, regularly holding discussion meetings in the workshop and reading newspapers and literary works. This workshop exceeds its production targets every month.

    In the No. 7 and No. 8 mines of the "Kopeisk Coal Industry" Trust, at the initiative of the Party group—where the Party group leader is the miner Nazalov—the situation of the youth workers' dormitories was inspected. A competition to win the best dormitories for youth workers began. The Communists of the Party group and the youth workers living in the dormitories jointly watched movies and dramas, organized discussion meetings and speeches for the youth workers, and organized recitations of literary works.

    Many Party groups keep diaries in order not to miss important issues, and record plans for the next day: who to discuss with, what tasks to check, etc. Diaries give a lot of help to the work of Party group organizers.

    The diary of Comrade Golubchikov, the Party group organizer of the No. 2 Martin workshop of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant, is of great interest. Below are his diary entries for a few days:

    "January 10, 1949: Our class won the championship in the factory in 1948, but I think that if we only rest on this, the work of the workshop will deteriorate. I exchanged opinions with the squad leader. It was decided to convene a Party group meeting tomorrow to discuss whether we Communists have done everything we can and whether we have used all our strength to expand production.

    March 17: The workshop guaranteed to propose 2 million rubles by accelerating the flow of funds. A resolution was made to formulate specific tasks for our class. A meeting of the Party group and technicians and steelmakers was convened. I attended the meeting not only as a Party organizer, but also as an assistant to the steelmaker, and explained in detail how I and steelmaker Slesarev obtained 440 kilograms of surplus steel production from one square meter of hearth. It is most powerful to persuade others with personal examples. Steelmakers Comrades Kazakov and Tesyakov also spoke.

    April 2: The Party group held an open meeting. In addition to Communists, five members of the Communist Youth League and twenty-seven non-Party workers also attended. A summary of the first quarter was made. The workshop completed the plan by 101.1 percent. Our team won the championship in the competition."

    The diary of Comrade Golubchikov often reflects the Party group's organization of political and production studies in the workshop and in the red corner (the club room in Soviet factories - translator's note).

    The smooth success of Party groups largely lies in the correct leadership of the Party's workshop branches and factory Party committees.

    Facts show that wherever the Party group organization is sound, wherever the Party group organizers work enthusiastically and are closely linked to the workshop and factory Party organization secretaries and regularly receive their help, the Communists and all workers in that workshop have a higher political level and enthusiasm. The main Party organizers are advanced Stakhanovite workers. Many Party group organizers are mine workers, Martin furnace workers, and rolling mill workers. It is the responsibility of the secretaries of workshop and factory organizations to help them regularly and systematically guide their work.

    One hundred and sixty-six Party groups were established in the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory. The secretaries of the workshop Party organizations, Zaparozhets, Sikolnikov, Subeleko, Loskutov, Zianov and other comrades, give regular help to the Party group organizers, conduct meetings to exchange experience with them, and listen to their reports at the workshop Party organization meetings. The factory Party committee convenes Party group organizers to discuss Party and production work issues. The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Tractorozavod District Committee gives great help to the factory Party committee in the work of Party groups.

    The Party's Oblast Committee and City Committee pay great attention to the quality of the work of Party groups. For example, the Chelyabinsk City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) discussed the work of the Ordzhonikidze Plant Party Committee in leading Party groups, and also discussed the work of Party groups in the Tractor Factory and other factories.

    The Magnitogorsk, Zlatoust, Korkino, Kopeysk, and Miass City Committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pay a lot of attention to the issue of leading Party groups and improving their work.

    The Party's Oblast Committee constantly guides the Party organizations of cities and districts, so that they improve the leadership of Party groups and make every effort to use their combat organizational strength to improve the level of Party and political work. The number of Party groups is constantly increasing, and it is important that they more actively influence production enterprises.

    However, some secretaries of Party organizations are still slack in leading the work of Party groups, allowing Party group organizers to drift and not guiding their actions. In some enterprises, Party groups have not been established in decisive production workshops.

    One of the important tasks of the Party organizations in the Oblast in 1949 is to strengthen the solution of problems that occur in enterprises. This is at least possible under these conditions: when Party leaders know every day and every hour what will happen in this or that production workshop, they must first direct all the attention of the Party organization to that place. Constant and close contact with Party groups is the guarantee of correct leadership of industry and also the guarantee of educating laborers in communism.

    The Party's Oblast organizations are taking these methods in order to improve the role of each Party group in completing the socialist obligations proposed by the laborers of Chelyabinsk Oblast in front of Comrade Stalin ahead of schedule.

　　企业中的党组
    （苏联经验介绍）
    切凉宾州劳动者致斯大林同志的信中曾保证社会主义的义务：在三年半完成五年计划的生产水平。这个义务的顺利完成，如果没有提高群众政治的和党组织的工作是不可思议的。
    党组（相当于中国共产党支部中的小组——编者）在完成经济、政治任务上具有很大的作用。他们影响着工场或小队的每个工人。联共（布）第十六次大会曾要求把党的工作重心真正移到工场和小队内，即是移到直接决定计划命运的车间。现在，当全体人民奋力争取提前完成五年计划，争取在工业工作中改善质量的指标的时候，对于党组的要求也增长着。
    党组对于自己车间工作的进行应给与有效的影响，尽快地掌握和传播一切新的、先进的事物，分析和努力铲除缺点，感化怠惰者。
    切凉宾冶金工厂熔炉车间的党组，对于任何一个破坏劳动和技术纪律的事件没有不经过讨论的。当换班后，党组时常利用十五分钟到二十分钟的时间集会，讨论迫切的问题。党组的积极工作，正确的配置干部，曾帮助车间不仅超过一九四九年第一季计划，而且还达到一九五○年的生产水平。
    党组以有效的促进生产和有始有终的把工作进行到底来巩固着群众信赖自己力量的信心，扩大着与非党者的连系。什么地方的党组倡导和坚持工作，它的威望就一定是很高的。每一个非党工人会把他所发生的一切问题提到党组交给共产党员和党的组织者。
    先进的党组对于普及和传播一切新事物给与很大的注意。这些新事物是在争取提前完成五年计划的斗争中为劳动者所创造出来的。他们在自己的车间中搜寻和采用社会主义竞赛最有效的形式，积极地和顽强地传播组织生产的先进方法。争取高等质量和超额生产的斗争和争取节省原料的斗争是基本的问题。党组围绕着这些问题组织自己生产上的工作，以这些问题教育共产党员。
    切凉宾运输机器制造工厂的工场中生产出许多劣货。党组的领导人阿列克斜也夫同志组织了名为“优良品质小队”的三个小队互相竞赛。设立了技术研究小组，党组每日监督它的进程。共产党员们很快地使各小队达到只生产高等质量的产品。现在则提出创设优良品质的工场的任务。
    乌拉尔汽车工厂的器械场的党组——这里的党组领导人是考兹洛夫同志——提出了使车间的每个工人掌握两种或三种专门技术的任务。不熟练的工人靠近了帮助他们熟悉新技能的共产党员。苏洛夫从苏维埃军队到工厂时没有专门技术。共产党员泡泡夫同志用两个月的时间帮助他成为一个削截工人。在工作的地方，在补充工作的技术研究小组的研究中，给了肯定的结果。所有工人的能力显著的提高。车间开始工作得很好。工人自己提出了许多合理化建议，同时由于工场的工程师和技师们的帮助而付诸实行。
    个人模范的力量特别使人信服。因此党组对于提高共产党员先锋的作用给与很多注意，教育他们具有组织的能力，提高他们的政治思想水平和生产的能力。
    党组关怀提高每个共产党员的政治水平，培养他们对书本独立学习的兴趣，教育他们具有有系统地研究马列主义理论的固有的要求。什么地方的党组的全部共产党员在党教育网中学习，通常在那里就会有更好的生产成就。
    切凉宾州的奥尔德诺尼基德捷工厂党组之一的全部党员和候补党员都在学习。党组组织者考瓦列夫同志有系统地监督共产党员所研究的内容，同时在自己的日记上记载研究的成就。每一种功课都要经过党组的讨论和通过。
    在党组所在的车间里健全地设立了鼓动工作。共产党员是积极的鼓动者，在工场里有规律地进行座谈会，朗读报纸和文艺作品。这个车间每个月都超过生产目标的。
    在“考别依斯克煤业”托辣斯第七、八号矿场中，由党组的倡导——这里的党组领导人是矿工那佐洛夫同志——曾检查青年工人宿舍的情况。开始了争取青年工人住最好的宿舍的竞赛。党组的共产党员和住在宿舍的青年工人共同看电影和戏剧，为青年工人组织座谈会，演说，组织文艺作品的诵读。
    许多的党组为了不放过重要问题而进行记日记，并记出关于第二天的计划：要和谁讨论，要检查什么任务等。日记对于党组组织者的工作给与很多的帮助。
    马哥尼脱高尔冶金工厂第二号马尔丁工场党组组织者高路布奇考夫同志的日记有很大趣味。下面就是他的几天的日记：
    “一九四九年一月十日：我们这一班曾于一九四八年荣获厂中冠军，但我认为：如果仅安于此，车间的工作会坏下去的。我曾与班长交换意见。决定明天召集党组会议，来讨论是否我们共产党员所能作的都曾作了，我们是否曾利用了一切力量来扩大生产。
    三月十七日：工场保证以加快流动资金方法提出二百万卢布。决议制定我们这一班的具体任务。召集了党组和技师与炼钢师的会议。我不仅以党组织者的资格，同时也以炼钢师之助手的资格出席会议，并且详细说明我和斯列萨列夫炼钢师如何从一平方公尺之炉底获得四百四十公斤的超额钢产。以个人的模范说服别人是最有力量的。炼钢师卡扎考夫和捷斯亚考夫同志也曾讲话。
    四月二日：党组进行公开会议。除共产党员外，有五个青年团员和二十七个非党工人也出席了。作出第一季的总结。工场完成计划百分之一百零一点一。我们小队在竞赛中荣获冠军。”
    在高路布奇考夫同志的日志中经常地反映出党组在工场，在红角（苏联工厂内俱乐部的房间——译者注）中组织政治学习和生产学习等的工作。
    党组的顺利成功大多在于党的工场支部和工厂党委员会方面对于它们的正确领导。
    事实说明：什么地方的党组机构健全，什么地方的党组组织者热情地工作而且紧密联系着工场和工厂党组织书记和经常地接受他们的帮助，那么这个车间的共产党员和全部工作者就具有较高的政治水平和积极性。党组织者主要的都是生产先进的斯塔哈诺夫工作者。许多的党组组织者是矿坑工人、马尔丁炉工人和延压机工人。工场和工厂组织的书记的责任是要经常地帮助他们，有系统地指导他们的工作。
    在切凉宾拖拉机工厂创立了一百六十六个党组。工场党组织的书记扎泡路也茨、师考里尼考夫、苏别列科、洛斯枯托夫、兹凉诺夫和其他诸同志对于党组组织者给与经常的帮助，同他们进行交换经验的会议，在工场党组织会议上听取他们的报告。工厂的党委会召集党组组织者商讨党和生产工作问题。联共（布）特拉克脱罗扎卧德区委会对于工厂党委会在党组工作上给与很大的帮助。
    党的州委会和城市委会对党组的工作质量给与很大的注意。如：联共（布）切凉宾城市委员会会议上讨论了奥尔德诺尼基德捷工厂党委会的领导党组的工作，还讨论了拖拉机工厂和其他工厂中党组的工作。
    联共（布）玛哥尼托高尔、兹拉托乌斯托夫、考尔金、考北依和米阿斯等城市委会对于党组的领导问题和改善它们的工作问题寄与很多的注意。
    党的州委会不断地指导城市和区的党组织，使他们改善领导党组，使他们尽力利用他们战斗的组织力量来提高党和政治工作水平。党组的数目不断的增加，重要地是它们更积极地影响生产事业。
    然而，某些党组织的书记仍然是松弛于领导党组的工作，使党组组织者陷于自流，没有指导他们的行动。在某些企业中的具有决定性的生产车间中没有建立党组。
    一九四九年在州的党组织的许多重要任务，是要求加强解决企业中发生的问题。这至少在这些条件下才是可能的：当党领导者每天每时都知道在这个或那个生产车间里将发生什么，首先必须把党组织的全部注意力引向该处。经常的与党组紧密的结合，是正确地领导工业的保证，也是以共产主义教育劳动者的保证。
    州的党组织正采取着这些方法，为了提高每个党组在提前完成切凉宾州劳动者在斯大林同志面前所提出的社会主义义务中的作用。
