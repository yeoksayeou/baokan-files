Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th: The Northwest Region Textile Workers' Representative Conference, lasting four days, concluded on the 21st. The Northwest Region Textile Workers' Union was also officially established at the same time. The main achievement of this conference was that the representatives ideologically clarified that the work of the union must be centered on production, and, in connection with the actual situation of each factory, they exchanged experiences of the union work in each factory. In the general meeting and the report of the group leaders, many representatives deeply reviewed the shortcomings of being busy with daily trivial matters in the past, the unclear division of union and administrative responsibilities, and the tendency of purely engaging in welfare work, isolatedly organizing learning and cultural entertainment activities, thus forming a disconnection between union work and production. During the conference, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, attended and spoke. He pointed out that everyone should face up to and overcome the current shortcomings in their work, strive to promote the democratic management system; union cadres must frequently go deep into the masses, understand the situation, listen to their opinions, conduct criticism and self-criticism; unite the activists among the workers, take production as the center of all work, and carry out union work in a planned and step-by-step manner.

　　西北纺织工会成立
    明确工会面向生产方针
    【新华社西安二十五日电】西北区纺织工人代表大会历时四日，已于二十一日结束。西北区纺织工会亦同时宣告成立。这次会议的主要收获是代表们在思想上明确认识了工会工作必须以生产为中心，并联系各厂实际情况，交流了各厂工会工作的经验。在大会上和小组长会报中，许多代表都深刻地检讨了过去忙于处理日常琐事，工会、行政责任混淆不清的缺点，和单纯地搞福利工作、孤立地组织学习与文化娱乐活动、因而形成工会工作与生产脱节的偏向。会议期间，西北军政委员会习仲勋副主席曾莅会讲话。他指出大家应该正视和克服目前工作中的缺点，努力推进民主管理制度；工会干部必须经常深入群众，了解情况，倾听他们的意见，进行批评与自我批评；团结工人中的积极分子，以生产为一切工作的中心，有计划有步骤地开展工会工作。
