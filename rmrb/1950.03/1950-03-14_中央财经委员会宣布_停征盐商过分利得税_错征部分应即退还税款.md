Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Commission recently announced the suspension of the excess profit tax on salt merchants, effective from March 10th of this year. It has also telegraphed major administrative regions' Financial and Economic Committees to implement this. The tax was introduced when salt taxes were increased in January of this year, with the aim of cracking down on unscrupulous merchants engaged in hoarding and speculation, and limiting excessive profits for salt merchants. Its scope was limited to salt stocks held by salt merchants before the tax increase. However, deviations have occurred in the implementation in some areas. Some areas have levied excess profit tax on salt merchants who have already paid taxes at the new tax rate, while others have levied it on salt companies, and some have even expanded the scope of collection to include salt stocks in sauce shops. Now, the Central Financial and Economic Commission, considering that most areas have already levied the excess profit tax on salt merchants who have obtained excessive profits after the January tax increase, has decided to suspend the tax from March 10th. It also stipulates that areas should immediately refund any taxes that have been erroneously collected due to incorrect implementation.

　　中央财经委员会宣布
    停征盐商过分利得税
    错征部分应即退还税款
    【新华社北京十三日电】中央人民政府政务院财经委员会，顷宣布自本年三月十日起停征盐商过分利得税，并已电令各大行政区财经委员会执行，按此项税收系于今年一月提高盐税时，为打击奸商囤积居奇，限制盐商暴利，决定临时进行征收，其征收范围只限于提税以前的盐商存盐。但近来个别地区在执行中发生偏差，有的对盐商已按新税额纳税部分也征收过分利得税，有的则向盐业公司进行征收，有的甚至将征收范围扩大到酱园的存盐。现中央财经委员会鉴于对于一月提税后获得暴利的盐商，各地大部已照章征收盐商过分利得税，特决定自三月十日起停征，并规定对因执行错误而发生错征部分，各地应即退还税款。
