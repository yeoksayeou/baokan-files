　　Pay Attention to Mine Safety Issues
    (Worker's Daily Short Commentary)
    The worker deaths and injuries in the Fushun and Kailuan coal mines in Northeast China are serious problems currently existing in coal mines. Because the coal mines operated by imperialists and bureaucrat-capitalists in the past only cared about pursuing profits and did not care about worker safety, the mine facilities were poor, the production conditions were bad, and the coercive management system forced workers to risk their lives.

    After liberation, although some mines in a few areas have been improved to some extent, most mines basically maintained the original policies of the takeover period. Safety facilities and management systems have not been reformed; and there is serious bureaucracy in management. They do not believe in relying on the masses to improve production, resulting in continuous serious accidents. For example, in Northeast China from January to October last year, 8,533 workers were killed or injured, and in North China from January to August last year, 3,471 workers were killed or injured. This shows how serious the coal mine safety problem has become!

    In order to effectively overcome mine disasters and eliminate casualties, we must vigorously improve mine safety facilities, establish a safety inspector system, universally strengthen safety technical education, and reform the old bad systems. This can only be achieved by earnestly implementing management democratization, establishing mine management committees, which can enlighten workers' class consciousness, rely on workers to improve mine safety, and ensure the implementation of safety regulations. Only in this way can we improve coal mine production.

　　重视矿山安全问题
    （工人日报短评）
    东北抚顺和开滦煤矿死伤工人事件，是目前煤矿中存在的严重问题。由于过去帝国主义、官僚资本主义所经营的煤矿，只顾追求利润，不顾工人安全，煤矿设施不善、生产条件恶劣、加上强迫命令的管理制度，迫使工人作生命冒险。
    解放后，少数地区矿山虽有若干改进，但大部分矿山基本上仍保持着接管时期原封不动的政策。安全设施和管理制度都未加以改革；并且在管理上存在着严重的官僚主义现象。不相信依靠群众，搞好生产，以致仍连续不断造成严重事故。如东北去年一月至十月，死伤工人达八五三三人，华北去年一月至八月，死伤工人达三四七一人。这说明煤矿安全问题到了何等严重的程度！
    为了有效地克服矿山灾害，消灭伤亡事故，必须大力改善矿山安全设施，建立安全监察员制度，普遍加强安全技术教育，并改革旧的恶劣制度。这惟有切实实行管理民主化，建立矿山管理委员会，才能启发工人的阶级觉悟，依靠工人改进矿山的安全，保证保安规则的执行。也惟有这样，才能搞好煤矿的生产。
