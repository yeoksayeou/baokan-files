　　Chahar Daily News: After the closing of the Second All-Circles Representative Conference in Yanggao County this month, most village representatives immediately convened meetings to convey and arrange spring plowing and production. Zhu Jian (village branch secretary), the representative of Nansha Ling village, convened various meetings of the branch committee, party members, league members, village representatives, and the masses upon returning to the village. He conveyed the resolution of the Second All-Circles Representative Conference to increase production to pre-war levels and held full discussions based on the specific conditions of the village. Initially, some cadres and masses lacked confidence. After Zhu Jian's patient persuasion and detailed accounting, the masses' thinking changed. The deputy branch secretary didn't believe that sorghum could germinate after being soaked in hot water. Zhu Jian explained to him, "Don't you soak beans to sprout them?" He immediately used a bowl of grain seeds for a soaking experiment. On the third day, the grain seeds had sprouted. After the villagers saw it, they guaranteed to soak all their seeds. When it came to planting special crops, many people were unwilling to plant hemp, flax, and reeds. Zhu Jian gave everyone a detailed accounting: each mu of hemp, calculated at the lowest yield of 50 jin, could be exchanged for seven or eight dou of grain, while generally planting grain could only yield three dou per mu. Each mu of flax, calculated at the lowest yield of one and a half dou, nine liang of flax seeds, can be exchanged for one jin of millet. Reeds can generate profits in three years, and one mu of reeds, based on weaving 300 "paizi" (each "paizi" can be exchanged for half a sheng of naked oats), can be exchanged for four shi and five dou of naked oats. After detailed accounting, the village originally planned to plant seven mu of flax, but now it has increased to one qing, and one qing of reeds will also be planted. After the masses' thinking was straightened out, they had confidence in restoring production to pre-war levels this year. The Xingjiabao representative returned to the village and held village representative meetings and mass meetings to convey the resolution, mobilize the masses to soak and mix seeds, organize themselves, and plant more oil crops. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the resolution, the branch assigned each of the thirteen party members to be responsible for leading ten households. At the mass meeting, cadres and masses used consultation and accounting methods to formulate the village's spring production plan. The masses all said, "Anyway, the more planning, the better. The People's Government and the Communist Party know how to plan a good life for the people."

　　察省阳高南沙岭等村
    人民代表布置春耕
    争取今年农业恢复战前水平经过细算账群众增产信心大
    【本报讯】察哈尔日报消息：本月一日，阳高县第二次各界代表会议闭幕后，大部村庄代表立即召开会议传达布置春耕生产。南沙岭村代表朱健（村支部书记），回村就召开了支委、党员、团员、村代表、群众各种会议，传达二次各界代表会增产达到战前水平决议，并根据该村具体情况作了充分讨论。开始，部分干部、群众信心不足，经过朱健耐心说服，细算账，群众思想才转变了。副支部书记不相信高粱用热水泡了，还能生芽。朱健就给他解释：“你生豆芽，不是泡过吗？”马上用一碗谷种作浸种试验，第三天谷种都生了芽，全村群众看过后，保证都要浸种。种特种作物，有许多人不愿种大麻、胡麻、苇子，朱健就给大家细算账：每亩麻按最低产量五十斤算，可换七、八斗谷，一般种谷一亩只能收三斗。一亩胡麻按最低产量斗半，九两胡麻籽，能换一斤小米。苇子三年就能得利，一亩苇子按编三百拍子（一张拍子能换升半莜麦），可换四石五斗莜麦。经细算账后，全村原计划种胡麻七亩，现增到一顷，苇子也种了一顷。群众思想打通后，对今年增产恢复战前水平有了信心。邢家堡代表回村，就开了村代表会、群众大会，传达了决议，动员群众浸种、拌种、组织起来，多种油料作物。支部为了保证决议彻底实现，十三个党员每人负责领导十家。群众大会上，干部与群众用商量、算账方式，订出全村春季生产计划，群众都说：“反正越计划越好了，人民政府、共产党就是会替老百姓打算过光景。”
