　　Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: After the visits of American imperialists Jessup and Griffin to Vietnam, the American government has further intensified its interference in the Vietnamese people's liberation movement. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 23rd, when US Secretary of State Acheson and his senior advisor on Far Eastern affairs discussed the so-called aid to Southeast Asia with Jessup, Butterworth, and others on the 23rd, they believed that supporting Bảo Đại was the "most urgent matter" at present. Griffin also suggested immediate action. According to a Reuters dispatch from Saigon on the 24th, the United States is preparing to transport modern jungle warfare weapons to Vietnam and send experts who have studied mountain guerrilla warfare in Greece to the region as part of American aid to the French forces in Vietnam. The American government's interference is also being carried out under the guise of "economic aid." According to a United Press dispatch from New York on the 24th, Griffin's mission has submitted proposals to Washington regarding economic aid to Bảo Đại. Regarding this "aid," according to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore on the 22nd, Griffin said to reporters when talking about the so-called aid to Southeast Asia: "If certain economic equipment or supplies can also be used in the war to suppress the communists, then we believe these plans are worthwhile."

　　妄图干涉越解放运动
    美帝支援保大傀儡
    杀人武器及专家等将连赴越南
    【新华社三十日讯】在美帝国主义分子耶塞普和葛里芬访问越南后，美国政府更加加紧对越南人民解放运动的干涉。据美联社华盛顿二十三日消息：美国务卿艾奇逊及其远东事务高级顾问，在二十三日和耶塞普、白德华等讨论所谓援助东南亚问题时，认为支援保大是目前“最紧迫的事情”。葛里芬并建议立即采取行动。据路透社西贡二十四日消息：美国准备把现代化的丛林作战武器运到越南，并将曾经在希腊研究过山地游击战的专家派往该地，作为美国援助越南法军的一部分。美国政府的干涉，还在“经济援助”的名义下进行。据合众社纽约二十四日消息：葛里芬的使团已向华盛顿方面提出关于经济援助保大的建议。关于这种“援助”，据路透社新加坡二十二日电引葛里芬在向记者谈及所谓援助东南亚时说：“假如某种有益于经济的装备或供应品，也能用于剿共战争中，那么，我们就认为这些计划是值得的”。
