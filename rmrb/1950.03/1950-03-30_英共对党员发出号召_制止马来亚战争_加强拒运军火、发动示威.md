　　Xinhua News Agency, London, March 27th. TASS reported: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement demanding an end to the Malayan War. The statement declared: Now, without a doubt, the Malayan War, which the British government has deceitfully described to the British people for two years as an "anti-bandit" operation, is in fact a large-scale war against the well-organized and determined Malayan People's Liberation Movement. After nearly two years of fierce military action and acts of terror—massacring national fighters, indiscriminately bombing villages, deporting over ten thousand people, and imprisoning over ten thousand people in concentration camps—the imperialist newspapers in Malaya say: "Suppressing the revolution is more difficult for us than when we started," and demand new methods of suppression and new troops. Reinforcements and armored vehicles are being shipped to Malaya, and the British people are being asked to contribute more manpower, financial resources, and munitions to this shameful colonial war of aggression.

    As the government decides to expand the battlefield and the scale of the war, the Malayan War has become a major threat to peace in Asia. The British people should now face up to the new situation in Malaya, treat it as a direct threat to world peace and a serious challenge to their own safety.

    The Communist Party calls on all members to rise up in opposition and help every part of the labor movement to understand and eliminate the new dangers. We call for: First, full support for demands across the country to stop the Malayan War; Second, mobilize all workers, trade unions and cooperative organizations, as well as youth and student groups, to rise up and make national demands and demonstrations against the continuation of the Malayan War; Third, do not transport munitions and war materials for the Malayan War.

    The war against the Malayan people is also a war against the British working class! Peace is our primary and fundamental task! Deal a heavy blow to the warmongers by stopping the Malayan War!

　　英共对党员发出号召
    制止马来亚战争
    加强拒运军火、发动示威
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：英国共产党政治委员会发表声明，要求停止马来亚战争。声明宣称：现在，毫无疑问，英国政府两年来欺骗地对英国人民说成“剿匪”行动的马来亚战争，事实上，是对付组织良好、意志坚决的马来亚人民解放运动的一个大规模战争。经过将近两年的激烈军事行动与恐怖行为——集体屠杀民族战士、滥炸乡村、放逐了一万以上的人民以及在集中营里监禁了一万以上的人民——之后，马来亚的帝国主义报纸却说：“我们要镇压革命比刚开始时更困难了”，并要求新的镇压方法和新的军队。援军和装甲汽车正被运往马来亚，英国人民正被要求为这一可耻的殖民地侵略战争更多地贡献出人力、财力和军火。
    由于政府决定扩大战场和战争规模，马来亚战争已成为对亚洲和平的重大威胁。英国人民现在应该正视马来亚的新形势，把它当作对世界和平的直接威胁和对他们自身安全的严重挑战。
    共产党号召全体党员奋起反对，并帮助劳工运动的每一部分去了解和消灭新的危险。我们号召：第一，全力支持全国各地制止马来亚战争的要求；第二，动员一切工人、工会和合作社组织以及青年和学生团体等起来作全国性的要求和示威，反对继续马来亚战争；第三，不运送用于马来亚战争的军火和战争物资。
    对马来亚人民的战争，也就是对英国工人阶级的战争！和平是我们首要的和根本的任务！用制止马来亚战争来给战争贩子们以沉重的打击！
