　　Japanese Coal Miners and Electrical Workers
    Hold Nationwide Strike
    Railway Workers and Seamen Hold Demonstrations
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 28th] Japanese workers are persisting in their strike struggle to demand wage increases. According to a comprehensive Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch: The Coal Miners' Union Federation, which began striking on March 8th, after negotiations with the employers broke down on the 20th, began a nationwide simultaneous general strike for seven days on the 25th, with 310,000 workers participating in the strike. According to the union, Japan's coal production will be reduced by one million tons due to this strike. The strike from March 8th to 20th had already reduced coal production by about 700,000 tons.
    The Japanese Electrical Workers' Union, which has been implementing rotating regional power outage strikes since the 9th, began a nationwide power outage strike, including general electricity outages, on the 23rd.
    On the 25th, about 20,000 people, including workers from the national railways, seamen, and monopoly bureau workers, held a rally in front of the Imperial Palace Plaza to demand wage increases.
    MacArthur's headquarters and the Yoshida government continue to increase pressure on the strikes, insisting on harming the interests of the workers. According to Agence France-Presse, Ames, the chief of the Labor Section of MacArthur's headquarters, summoned Takeo Muto, chairman of the Coal Miners' Union Federation, on the 25th, ordering him to "resolve" the coal mine dispute "as soon as possible." Yoshii, director of the Labor Administration Bureau of the Yoshida government, summoned both labor and management of the coal mining industry on the 24th to conduct "inquiries" (Kyodo News). According to Kyodo News, Yoshida government's Minister of Finance Hayato Ikeda, Minister of Transport Shinzo Oya, Minister of Labor Masafumi Suzuki, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kakushichi Masuda, discussed countermeasures to cope with the demands of Japanese National Railway workers for wage increases with Major General Marquat, chief of the Economic and Scientific Section of MacArthur's headquarters, on the 25th, and decided to refuse to pay the year-end bonus of 300 million yen.
