　　This is "Aid Material"!
    As is well known, the Marshall Plan brought unemployment, famine, and poverty to the so-called "beneficiary" countries, while the pockets of overseas "benefactors" swelled with gold.
    Anything that cannot find a market in the United States can be shipped to Marshallized countries under the grandiose name of "economic aid." Razors, toys, canned goods, horse meat, face powder—this is what the United States "helps" Europe with. For example, American merchants gave Austria hats, filling the shelves of Vienna's shops with all kinds of women's hats.
    Recently, a new "commodity" has appeared. According to the "Berlin Times," an American ship that arrived in Hamburg was loaded with 10,000 tons of… rags teeming with maggots. Such "aid" even stumped the German officials inspecting documents at the Hamburg port health department. As a result, they prohibited unloading. But the "benefactors" were angry: two "ungrateful" customs officers who prohibited unloading were immediately dismissed, and the rest were instructed that these rags were very useful and could be used to make paper.
    Thus, 10,000 tons of rags, teeming with maggots, beautifully packaged, and labeled "Marshall Plan Aid Material," were unloaded on German soil.
    American merchants made a fortune from this new type of "aid": the transportation costs alone for this batch of "precious goods" cost the German people $600,000.

### 这就是“援助物资”！

　　这就是“援助物资”！
    如所周知，马歇尔计划给所谓“受惠”国家带来了失业、饥荒和贫穷，同时海外“恩主”的荷包里则增加了不少的金元。
    凡是在美国找不到销路的东西都可以用“经济援助”的堂皇名义装到马歇尔化的国家去。剃刀、玩具、罐头、马肉、香粉——这就是美国“帮助”欧洲的东西。例如美国商人给了奥大利帽子，使维也纳店铺子的货架上都堆满了各种各样女人帽子。
    不久前出现了一种新的“货色”。据“柏林时报”报导，汉堡到的一艘美国船装来了一万吨……丛生着虫蛆的破布。这样的“援助”甚至把汉堡港卫生处检查证件的德国官员难倒了。结果他们禁止卸货。但是“恩主”们生了气：两个“忘恩负义”禁止卸货的海关人员被立刻解职，余下的则奉到指令说，这些破布大有用处，是可以造纸的。
    这样，一万吨满生虫蛆、包子打得漂亮、写着“马歇尔计划援助物资”的破布，卸在德国土地上了。
    美国商人在这一新式“援助”下捞了一大笔钱：这批“宝货”，单是运费一项就使德国人民损失了六十万美元。
