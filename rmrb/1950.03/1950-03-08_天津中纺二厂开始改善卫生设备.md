　　Tianjin No. 2 Textile Factory Begins to Improve Sanitary Facilities
    [This newspaper dispatch] Following the inspection of the Tianjin No. 2 Textile Factory's hygiene by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government and Soviet experts, the factory has organized a hygiene and health committee and begun to improve sanitary facilities. Under the conditions of spending little and being able to improve hygiene, three toilets were first added in the auditorium and next to the yarn workshop, and heating pipes were installed in one of the toilets to make the toilet temperature consistent with the temperature inside the workshop. The workshop decided to add 350 spittoons. Each workshop is equipped with enameled drinking buckets. At the same time, the trade union has ordered a batch of covered magnetic bowls and mobilized the workers to buy their own. The canteen will focus on strengthening hygiene inspection, and the original bowls and chopsticks will be distributed to each person as a set, fixed for their use. In addition, it is planned to install a flush toilet in the women's toilet to take care of pregnant and menstruating female workers first. Plans are also underway to gradually implement reheating cold food for workers, cleaning and sweeping workshops, installing screens and preventing flies and eliminating fleas in summer.

　　天津中纺二厂开始改善卫生设备
    【本报讯】天津中纺二厂自经中央人民政府劳动部与苏联专家检查工厂卫生后，该厂已组织了卫生保健委员会，开始改善卫生设备。在花费不多且能改善卫生的条件下，首先在礼堂及纱场旁添设了厕所三处，并在一部厕所内按装暖气管，使厕所温度与场内温度一致。车间决定添置痰盂三百五十个。每个车间均按装洋瓷饮水桶。同时工会已订购有盖磁碗一部发动工友自购。饭厅则着重加强清洁检查工作，把原有的碗筷分给每人一套，固定起来。此外，计划在女厕所按装一部抽水马桶，尽先照顾怀孕及月经期女工。关于工友冷饭蒸热及工房清洁扫除、夏季按装纱窗及防蝇除蚤等也都正在计划逐步实现中。
