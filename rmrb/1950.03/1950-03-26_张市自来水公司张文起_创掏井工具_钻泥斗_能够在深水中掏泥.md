Zhang Wenqi of Zhangjiakou Water Company
    Creates Well-Dredging Tool "Drill Mud Bucket"
    Capable of Dredging Mud in Deep Water

　　[This newspaper reported] Zhang Wenqi, a technician at the Zhangjiakou Water Company, created a well-dredging tool called the "Drill Mud Bucket." It has a simple structure, great efficiency, and saves a lot of expenses compared to using electric pumps or manual well-dredging. It can also solve the difficulty of dredging mud in deep water. The company's first water source, Gushicun, originally had three water wells, each five meters in diameter and about ten meters deep, built by the Japanese invaders in 1939. For over ten years, the wells have accumulated more than four meters of silt and sand. If they are not dredged soon, the water inlets will be blocked, affecting the water supply. However, because the wells have a very strong water output, even with a 30-horsepower water pump running continuously, the water level remains very deep, making it impossible to completely clear the mud by manual digging. Using additional pumps would greatly increase electricity expenses. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, the company's leadership proposed the slogan of "No Electricity, Saving Expenses" and mobilized employees to create new well-dredging tools. Technician Zhang Wenqi, with the help and support of the foreman and technicians, painstakingly researched and, imitating the form of a drill bit, created the Drill Mud Bucket. When using it, the drill is inserted into the well, and two or three people turn it forcefully. The mud is then drilled into the bucket. When the drill is full, it is lifted to remove the mud. The test results were excellent. On the 16th, the third well was drilled 164 times, dredging approximately three cubic meters of silt and sand, thus solving the difficulty of dredging silt at the bottom of deep wells. According to the company's statistics, using this tool to dredge these three wells can save more than 16,400 catties of millet compared to using electric pumps and manual underwater dredging.

　　张市自来水公司张文起
    创掏井工具“钻泥斗”
    能够在深水中掏泥
    【本报讯】张家口市自来水公司技工张文起，创造掏井工具钻泥斗，构造简单，效能宏大，较用电力抽水、人工掏井既节省很多开支，且更能解决深水掏泥的困难。该公司第一水源孤石村，原有水源井三眼，每眼直径五米，深约十米，系日寇于一九三九年建设。迄今十来年，井内淤积泥沙已有四米余高，如再不掏挖，井内输水口即将堵塞，影响水源供水。但该井因出水量很旺，用三十马力抽水机不停抽水，水量仍很深，用人工挖掘不能彻底掏清；如再增用抽水机，则又将增加很大的电力开支。为此该公司领导上特于本月初提出“在不用电力，节省开支”的口号下，发动职工创造新的掏井工具。技工张文起在工务长及技师的帮助支持下，苦心钻研，仿用钻头形式，创造了钻泥斗，使用时将钻插入井内，二、三人用力转动，泥即可钻于桶内，钻满时将钻提起即可把泥挖出。经试验结果成绩良好。十六日一天内，第三号井即钻了一百六十四斗，掏挖泥沙约三立方米，因而解决了深水掏挖井底淤泥的困难。据该公司统计，利用此种工具挖掏该三井，可较用电力抽水、人工下水掏挖节省小米一万六千四百余斤。
