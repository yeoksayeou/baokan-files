Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government hosted a banquet on the 27th to entertain the Northwest ethnic youth and women's visiting group and bid farewell to Wangjia and other Xikang Tibetan representatives who arrived in Beijing last month to pay tribute to the leaders of the Central People's Government. At the banquet, Liu Geping, Vice Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, said in his speech: The central government's ethnic policies are being gradually implemented in various regions, and a new relationship of great unity among all ethnic groups in the country has begun to be established. To further consolidate unity, it is still necessary to eliminate the ethnic hatred created by the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism, as well as the remaining ideas of great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. We must be vigilant against the conspiracies of American-Chiang Kai-shek agents to split the unity of our country's ethnic groups. Wangjia and other representatives of the Tibetan people of Xikang expressed their gratitude for the warm welcome they received in Beijing. Wangjia said: After we return to Xikang, we must tell every Tibetan about the care of the Central People's Government and the people of all ethnic groups in the interior for the Tibetan people. Roumanna (Tatar) and Shadier (Uyghur), deputy leaders of the Northwest ethnic youth and women's visiting group, spoke one after another, unanimously believing that thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army, and the concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, the Northwest has been liberated. The task of all ethnic groups in the future is to unite closely and strive to build a new China of ethnic friendship and cooperation.

This newspaper reports. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation jointly hosted a banquet last night (the 28th) to entertain the Northwest ethnic youth and women's visiting group that recently arrived in Beijing.
