　　Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Locomotive No. 1585:
    Engine Crew and Overhaul Team Sign Contract
    Guaranteeing Improved Locomotive Quality and Extended Class A Inspection
    [This Newspaper] The No. 1585 locomotive crew and the Class A overhaul team of the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot have signed a contract to strive for safe operation of the locomotive for more than 150,000 kilometers, with the goal of extending the Class A overhaul period to more than 100,000 kilometers. Locomotive No. 1585 is a key target for cultivating a locomotive banner for the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot. Since the locomotive was assigned to the current crew, it has safely operated for more than 63,800 kilometers as of March 5th. According to a mid-January inspection, the locomotive's quality ranked first in the entire depot, and it has consistently been kept clean. The achievements are due to two factors: firstly, under the leadership of driver Li Fengtong, the locomotive crew regularly holds group meetings to review their work, strengthening mutual solidarity and responsibility, and improving their technical skills; secondly, the Class A overhaul team is very responsible for the locomotive. To further improve locomotive quality and extend the Class A inspection mileage, under the leadership of the administration and the trade union, both the locomotive crew and the Class A overhaul team have developed work plans, made mutual guarantees, and held a grand contract signing meeting on March 2nd. To strengthen the relationship between drivers and dispatchers, the engine crew also held a forum with the locomotive dispatchers of the dispatching office, where they studied Soviet driving experience.
