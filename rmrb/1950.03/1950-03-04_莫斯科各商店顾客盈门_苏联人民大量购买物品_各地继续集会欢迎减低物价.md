Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: Comprehensive TASS news: March 1st was the first day of trade in the Soviet Union under the reduced prices. From early morning, Moscow stores were as crowded as on the eve of a major holiday. The stores were piled high with goods, and government and party announcements regarding price reductions were prominently displayed.

The Moscow Central Department Store had processed 65,000 transactions by 3:00 PM, twice the usual amount. The store sold a large quantity of silk fabrics, watches, newly manufactured radios, bicycles, carpets, cameras, and perfumes. The Gastronom food store on Smolenskaya Square (the largest food store in the Soviet capital) sold more than twice the usual amount of meat, sugar, sausage, oil, and wine, and three times as much cheese and caviar. To guarantee supply for the increased demand, the store purchased hundreds of tons of goods the day before, and the variety of goods was greatly increased, including seventy different types of sausage, forty different types of fish, and two hundred different brands of wine.

The reduction in state retail prices also affected collective farm trade. On March 1st, farmers were selling their goods at the Moscow market for prices 25 to 30 percent lower than the day before.

The elated Soviet people are talking everywhere, even engaging strangers in warm conversations about how much their savings have increased, and how their real wages have increased by 20 or 25 percent. At the Central Department Store alone, customers who purchase the same amount of goods this year as last year will save 250 million rubles.

Mass rallies continue to be held across the country. In Vladivostok, meetings were held in workshops, factories, and on merchant marine ships. At a mass rally at the New Siberian Garment Factory, worker Kangxin said, "The Soviet people will benefit by 110 billion rubles from the price reductions, and my family will receive 10,000 rubles for the whole year as a result." The working people of Transcarpathia and Latvia held meetings and pledged to further increase national income with Stakhanovite labor and further strengthen the power of the socialist state.

　　莫斯科各商店顾客盈门
    苏联人民大量购买物品
    各地继续集会欢迎减低物价
    【新华社北京三日电】综合塔斯社消息：三月一日是苏联按照减低了的物价进行贸易的第一天。莫斯科各商店从清早起，就像大节日的前夜一样挤满了顾客，商店里堆满大批货物，在醒目的地方张贴着政府与党关于减低物价的公告。
    莫斯科中央百货商店在下午三点钟以前就做了六万五千宗买卖，等于平日的两倍，该店售出大量丝织品、表、新制的无线电机、自行车、地毯、照相机和香水。在斯摩棱斯卡雅广场的卡斯特罗诺姆食品店（苏京最大的食品店），比往常多卖了一倍多的肉、糖、香肠、油和酒，多卖了两倍的乳酪和三倍的鱼子酱。商店为保证供应增加了的需要，先一天就购进了数以百吨计的物品，货物的种类也大大增多，包括七十种不同的香肠、四十种不同的鱼和二百种不同牌子的酒。
    国家零售价格的减低，也影响到集体农场的贸易。三月一日，农民们在莫斯科市场上以比前一天便宜百分之二十五至百分之三十的价钱来出售其货物。
    兴高采烈的苏联人民在到处谈论，见了不相识的人也亲切地谈论着他们的存蓄增加了多少，实际工资增加了百分之二十或二十五。仅以中央百货商店来说，顾客们如在今年购买和去年同样多的货物，就会节省二亿五千万卢布。
    全国各地继续举行群众大会。在海参崴，各工作间、各工厂和商船队的船上都举行了会议。在新西伯利亚大成衣工厂的群众大会上，工人康辛说：“苏联人民将因物价减低获得一千一百亿卢布的利益，我的家庭全年将因此得到一万卢布”。外喀尔巴阡各地和拉脱维亚的劳动人民都举行会议，并保证以斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动进一步增加国民收入，更大地加强社会主义国家的威力。
