Twelve teams participated in the table tennis competition, which concluded at the end of last December; the champion was the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau. Ten teams participated in the basketball competition; because only one game could be played each week, the final game between the Xinhua News Agency and the North China People's Liberation Army Daily was held at the General Administration of News on the 19th of this month. The two sides were evenly matched, and the competition was extremely fierce. Until the last five seconds, the North China People's Liberation Army Daily scored a free throw and won the championship by a narrow margin of forty to thirty-nine, a difference of one point.
