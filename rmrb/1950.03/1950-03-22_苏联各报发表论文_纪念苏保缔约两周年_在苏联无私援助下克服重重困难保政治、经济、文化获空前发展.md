　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st: TASS, Moscow: Soviet newspapers widely commemorated the second anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance on the 18th. Konstantinov wrote in Pravda that, thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people have overcome numerous obstacles and achieved unprecedented development in politics, economy, and culture. Bulgaria is implementing a five-year plan. Several large enterprises, power stations, and highways have been completed. Huge factories for artificial fertilizers, soda, vehicle repair, and others are beginning to be built. To vigorously assist Bulgaria's socialist industrialization, the Soviet Union, according to the obligations of the treaty, has supplied Bulgaria with valuable equipment, metals, petroleum products, and other materials, and has provided the necessary technical assistance. Bulgarian agriculture is successfully overcoming its long-standing backwardness. There are now more than 1,600 agricultural cooperatives cultivating 156,000 hectares of land (approximately 11 percent of all arable land), 91 state-owned farms cultivating 85,000 hectares of land, and 86 machine and tractor stations.
　　The U.S. government, in order to continue pursuing its policy of intimidation and blackmail, has severed diplomatic relations with Bulgaria, but this will never make the Bulgarian people change their position of safeguarding the independence and freedom of their motherland.
　　The News reported that the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty, like the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with various People's Democratic countries in the East and West, aims to guarantee international peace. Red Star reported that the actions of the U.S. government increasingly reveal that it is an enemy of the freedom and independence of all nations. The Bulgarian people guard their democratic achievements and will not allow anyone to incite them against the Soviet Union.

　　苏联各报发表论文
    纪念苏保缔约两周年
    在苏联无私援助下克服重重困难保政治、经济、文化获空前发展
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联报纸十八日广泛纪念苏保友好合作互助条约签订两周年。康士坦丁诺夫在真理报撰文称：由于苏联无私的援助，保加利亚人民克服了重重障碍，在政治、经济和文化上获得史无前例的发展。保加利亚正执行五年计划，若干大企业、电力站和公路已经完成，巨大的人造肥料、苏打、车辆修理等工厂在开始建造，苏联为大力帮助保加利亚社会主义工业化，根据条约的义务，供给了保国以贵重设备、金属、石油产品等物资，并给以必要的技术援助。保加利亚的农业正在成功地克服着年代久远的落后性，现在已有一千六百个以上的农业合作社，耕种着十五六万公顷土地（按约占全部耕地的百分之十一），九十一个国有农场耕种着八万五千公顷土地，和八十六个机器与拖拉机站。
    美国政府为继续奉行其恫吓与讹诈政策，和保加利亚断绝了外交关系，但这绝不会使保国人民改变他们维护祖国独立自由的立场。
    消息报称：苏保条约也如苏联和东、西方各人民民主国家所缔结的条约一样，旨在保障国际和平。红星报称：美国政府的行为越益显露它是各民族的自由与独立的敌人。保加利亚人民警卫其民主成果，不许任何人鼓动他们反对苏联。
