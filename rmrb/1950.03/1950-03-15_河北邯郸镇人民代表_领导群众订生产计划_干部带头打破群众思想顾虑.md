People's Representative of Handan Town, Hebei
    Leads the Masses in Formulating Production Plans
    Cadres Take the Lead in Breaking Down Ideological Concerns of the Masses
    [This newspaper reports] After the conclusion of the Handan Town People's Representative Conference in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, on the second of last month, representatives from various villages and streets, model laborers, and village cadres went back to their villages to convey the resolutions. The government also assigned thirty-two cadres to form five working groups to help representatives and village cadres hold various meetings of different sizes. After three days of conveying the resolutions, explaining policies, and resolving many ideological obstacles among the masses, the fourth day saw the entry into family meetings to formulate plans for each household. As of the 15th, the masses in key villages and streets have generally formulated production plans. In the Southeast District, out of a total of 878 households, 797 have formulated plans, accounting for 90 percent of the total. In general villages and streets, in addition to cadres above the level of group leader and all party members who have finalized their plans, the masses have also held family meetings, and some have formulated plans. According to statistics from six villages, the area planted with cotton last year was 383 mu, and this year it is planned to plant 739 mu, an expansion of 356 mu.
    When starting to hold family meetings to formulate plans, the masses had many ideological concerns: (1) fear that cadres would understand their situation. (2) Misunderstanding that formulating plans meant taking responsibility. (3) Fear of trouble, believing that they could produce without leadership. (4) Fear of not being able to complete specific plans. Due to these ideological obstacles, resistance to formulating plans arose, and calculations often made income insufficient to cover expenses. After cadres and party members took the lead in formulating plans and used concrete examples to promote and repeatedly explain production policies to the masses, and promptly put forward slogans such as "Eating won't make you poor, dressing won't make you poor, but not knowing how to plan will leave you poor," and "You don't know the price of firewood and rice until you run the household." In this way, the ideological concerns of the general masses were dispelled, especially gaining the sympathy of some parents. The passive resistance to formulating plans for higher authorities turned into actively holding family meetings to formulate plans. For example, Li Jingchun of Ganhegou specially brought his wife back from her parents' home to discuss planning. He Shuwen of He Village carefully discussed the formulation of plans through three family meetings. However, due to the short period of time, the ideological problems of some masses in non-key villages have not yet been completely resolved, and preparations are being made to continue to resolve them.
    The following experiences were gained from this family meeting to formulate plans:
    (1) To formulate plans for each household, it is necessary to first resolve the ideological concerns of the masses.
    (2) Holding family meetings to formulate plans can promote family unity and harmony, and collective responsibility. Most peasant families are internally disharmonious, with rifts that cannot be resolved, hindering the enthusiasm for production. From this experience, it was realized that holding family meetings is a good way to solve this obstacle. He Shuwen's family of six in He Village had previously been of five minds, each with their own plans. After three family meetings with democratic consultation, the crux of mutual disharmony was dispelled, and a year-round production plan was formulated on a voluntary basis.
    (3) Formulating plans must be based on the different characteristics of different families, and the plans must start from the existing foundation. Some families only provide food but not clothing for women. As long as democratic discussions are launched, and individual production plans are formulated based on different labor, taking into account the interests of women themselves, unreasonable old habits of the past can also be gradually broken.

### 河北邯郸镇人民代表  领导群众订生产计划  干部带头打破群众思想顾虑

　　河北邯郸镇人民代表
    领导群众订生产计划
    干部带头打破群众思想顾虑
    【本报讯】河北省邯郸专区邯郸镇各界人民代表会上月二日结束后，各村街代表、劳动模范及村干部分头回村传达了决议。政府并抽出三十二个干部组织五个工作组，帮助代表、村干召开各种不同的大小会议。经过三天的传达决议讲解政策，解决群众不少的思想障碍。第四日即进入家庭会，制订按家计划。至十五日止重点村街群众普遍订出生产计划。东南小区共八七八户，订出计划的七九七户，占全数百分之九十。一般村街除小组长以上的干部及全体党员已订妥外，群众也都召开了家庭会，部分的订出计划。据六个村统计，去年种棉三八三亩，今年计划种七三九亩，扩大面积三五六亩。
    在开始开家庭会订计划时，群众曾有很多思想顾虑：（一）怕干部了解自己时光。（二）误认订计划是要负责。（三）怕麻烦，认为不用领导也会生产。（四）怕订得具体完不成。由于这些思想障碍，对订计划产生抵抗情绪，计算则多使之入不敷出。经过干部党员带头先订，用具体例证，向群众宣传，再三讲解生产政策，并及时提出“吃不穷，穿不穷，不会打算光受穷”、“不当家不知道柴米贵”的口号。这样打消了一般群众的思想顾虑，特别获得一些家长的同情。由给上级订计划的消极抵抗情绪，变为主动的召开家庭会积极订计划。如干河沟李景春为了订计划，特别把老婆从娘家接回来商议。贺庄贺书文订计划经过三次家庭会议慎重讨论。不过由于时间短促，在非重点村尚有些群众思想问题尚未彻底解决，准备继续解决。
    从这次召开家庭会订计划中，获得以下几点经验：
    （一）订按家计划必须首先解决群众的思想顾虑。
    （二）开家庭会订计划能促使家庭团结和睦，集体负责。农民的家庭多半内部不和睦，隔阂无法解决，障碍生产的积极性，从这次体验到召开家庭会是解决这一障碍的好办法。贺庄贺书文一家六口人，平日五条心，各有打算，经过三次家庭会民主商量，打消了互不和睦的症结，并在自愿基础上订出全年生产计划。
    （三）订计划必须根据群众不同家庭不同的特点，计划也就必须从旧有基础出发。有些家庭对妇女管吃不管穿，只要发动民主讨论，根据不同劳动订出各人生产计划，照顾妇女本身利益，过去不合理的旧习惯，也能逐步打破。
