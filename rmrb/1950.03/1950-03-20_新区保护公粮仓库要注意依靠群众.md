　　In New Districts, Protecting Public Grain Warehouses Requires Relying on the Masses

To the Editor:

　　I have something to report to you. If you deem it necessary, I hope it can be published in the newspaper or forwarded to the government leaders for reference.

　　We are in a newly liberated area, and social order is not yet stable. The bandits and secret agents arranged by the Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs, as well as the local bullies and landlords, are still colluding and committing evil deeds. In Yangshuo County alone, there have been two incidents of grain depots being robbed recently. This shows that the lurking Kuomintang bandit gangs are constantly looking for opportunities to carry out sabotage activities, while our leading organs are not vigilant enough and still harbor a "complacent" mentality. For example, a district head of the county government said in a report on bandit activity: "These bandits probably don't have major connections!" The grain depot director, Huang Guangyu, dismissed the idea of lurking bandits and secret agents as "groundless talk," neither being vigilant nor reporting it to higher authorities. The leading organs of the county and district are not concerned enough about the storage of public grain. They have not educated the cadres in charge of grain depots to cherish state property, nor have they mobilized the masses and relied on the masses. There is a shortage of cadres, and instead of selecting cadres from among the masses, they are misusing old grain depot personnel. For example, Li Guanghui and Zhou Hongfei were the henchmen of Kuomintang secret agents Huang Yuheng and Deng Wencai. When they served as township cadres, they even spoke for the local bullies and landlords; they allowed Huang Yuheng and others to enter and leave the grain depot at will. Because the leading cadres and staff are so detached from the masses, even some backward elements have been deceived by the secret agents. We hope that the leading cadres will change their style of work, go deep among the masses, listen to their opinions, pursue the main culprits, and investigate and remove incompetent personnel and internal traitors. Our most pressing demand at present is to overthrow the local bullies and landlords, carry out rent reduction and refund, and solve the difficulties in spring plowing. If these can be done, the old roots of the bandits will be uprooted. The masses have complete faith in the People's Government and hope that the government will effectively solve this problem.

### 新区保护公粮仓库要注意依靠群众

　　新区保护公粮仓库要注意依靠群众编辑同志：
    有一件事我想报告给你们，如果认为有必要，希望登在报上或转给政府领导同志参考。
    我们这里是新解放区，社会秩序还不安定，李宗仁白崇禧匪帮安排下的土匪特务和恶霸地主还在勾结作恶。阳朔一县，近来就接连出了两桩粮仓被抢劫的事。从这件事可以看到潜伏的国民党匪帮还时时在找空子进行破坏活动，而我们的领导机关还不够警惕，还存着“苟安”思想。如县府某区长在报告匪情时却说：“这些土匪大概没有大关系！”粮仓主任黄广宇对土匪特务的潜伏竟认为是“无稽之谈”，不加警惕也不向上级报告。县区领导机关干部对于保管公粮是不够关心的，没有教育管粮仓的干部爱护国家财产，也没有发动群众、依靠群众。干部缺乏，不从群众中选拔干部，滥用旧的粮仓人员，如黎光辉、周宏飞，就是国民党特务黄玉衡、邓文才的狗腿子，担任乡干部时竟替恶霸地主讲话；平时让黄玉衡等随意出入粮仓。因为领导干部和工作人员如此脱离群众，以致部分落后分子也受了特务分子的欺骗。希望领导干部改变作风，深入群众，听听群众的意见，追拿首恶，审查清除不称职的人员和内奸分子。我们目前最迫切的要求是打倒恶霸地主，进行减租退租，解决春耕中的困难。能做到这些，土匪的老根就拔掉了。群众是万分相信人民政府的，希望政府有效地解决这一问题。
