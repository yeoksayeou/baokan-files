　　The Beijing-Taiyuan and Datong-Puzhou Railways Have Some Shortcomings; Hoping the Railway Bureau Will Pay Attention to Improvement

　　Recently, I traveled back and forth on the Beijing-Taiyuan and Datong-Puzhou passenger trains, and I heard and saw the following points of feedback, which I provide to the Railway Bureau's working comrades for reference.

　　1. The train travel time is not accurate enough. The passenger train from Beijing to Taiyuan on February 5th was delayed by one hour and a few minutes from the scheduled time, and the train from Taiyuan to Dezhou on March 1st was 30-odd minutes late to Shijiazhuang. Originally, passengers arriving in Beijing could transfer to a northbound train in Shijiazhuang, but because of this train's delay, they had to wait until the next day. According to passengers on the same train, "Train delays are a frequent occurrence."

　　2. The order on the train is chaotic. Especially on the Datong-Puzhou passenger train, there are no seats, and everyone is crowded. Some passengers take advantage of the situation, with several people crowding at the train door, saying "Full, full" when others try to board. There are no lights on the train, so it is dark at night, and the railway staff rarely inspects, so they get the "advantage." As a result, other carriages are extremely crowded. One fellow villager said, "If a woman is several months pregnant, she wouldn't dare ride this train." I suggest installing lights, putting in some wooden benches, and increasing inspections so that it won't be so crowded.

　　3. The Beijing-Taiyuan passenger train has a dining car, but it only sells expensive food, and the prices are half again as high as in the market. On February 5th, a bowl of egg drop soup cost 1,500 yuan. So, it only benefits a small number of people with better living conditions, and most soldiers and working people cannot afford it. I suggest adding the sale of cornmeal buns and millet porridge to benefit the majority of people.

　　4. The ticket sales time at the Yuci station on the Datong-Puzhou line is too short. On two occasions, many passengers were unable to buy tickets. The hygiene on each train is very poor. Although it is announced that everyone should pay attention, passengers spit everywhere, and the toilets are also very dirty, with no one managing them.

### 京太、同蒲两路有些缺点  希望铁路局注意改进

　　京太、同蒲两路有些缺点
    希望铁路局注意改进
    最近我因事往返乘坐京太、同蒲客车，耳闻目睹有以下几点意见，提供给铁路局工作同志参考。
    一、火车行走时间不够准确。二月五日由北京开往太原的客车，比规定时间迟到一点零几分钟，三月一日由太原开往德州的车，到石家庄晚三十几分。原来到北京的客人可在石家庄换车北行，可是由这趟车误点，就得等到第二天。据同车的客人说：“火车误点是经常的事。”
    二、车上秩序乱。尤其是同蒲路的客车，车上没坐位，大家都乱挤。有的客人就投机取巧，几个人挤在车门上，别人上车他说“满了，满了”。车上又没有灯，夜里看不见，路局的人又很少检查，所以他们就讨了“便宜”。于是别的车上就拥挤不堪，有个老乡说：“如果几个月的孕妇，就不敢坐这车了”。建议能装上灯，安些木板凳子，勤加检查，这样就不会拥挤了。
    三、京太路的客车，专备有膳车，但卖的都是较高贵的食品，且价钱比市面要贵一半，二月五日一碗鸡蛋汤一千五百元。所以只便利了少数生活较优裕的人，大部分军人和劳动人民还吃不起。建议能增设卖棒子面饽饽和小米干饭，以便利大多数人。
    四、同蒲榆次站卖票时间太短，有两次还有许多客人没买上票。各车上的卫生很差，虽也宣布大家注意，可是车上的客人随地吐痰，厕所也很脏，也无人管理。
