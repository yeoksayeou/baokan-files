　　[This newspaper dispatch] Comprehensive news: To exchange advanced experiences, further promote the restoration and development of industrial production, and victoriously launch the 1950 economic construction work, state-owned and public enterprises in Northeast China, North China, East China and other places have successively held labor model conferences to reward labor models, new record creators, rationalization proposers, and outstanding technical and management personnel in industrial production. Before and after the New Year, various public enterprises and factories in Lüda (Dalian and Lushun) generally held staff and worker model conferences to summarize the work of 1949, study the production tasks for 1950, and reward models and rationalization proposers. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a circular on January 23, rewarding 75 leading cadres, technical personnel, workers, and staff members in public enterprises. In addition to material rewards from the factories and mines, the Industry Department also issued medals and certificates according to the size of their contributions to production.

　　In North China, most or part of the state-owned public enterprises in large and medium-sized cities such as Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Zhangjiakou, and in East China, such as Nanjing, Jinan, and Qingdao, also held labor model conferences in January and February this year to summarize and exchange advanced experiences in carrying out production movements and model producers.

　　In summarizing advanced experiences, all localities unanimously proved that it is necessary to thoroughly rely on the working class, implement democratic management, give full play to the collective wisdom of the working class, and at the same time implement a strict economic accounting system in order to continuously improve productivity. After the implementation of democratic management in state-owned and public factories and mines in Northeast China, a new record creation movement was launched on the basis of the increased awareness of the working class. According to incomplete statistics over four months, more than 10,000 new production records were created. Some factories and mines have exceeded the production level of the puppet Manchukuo era. When the Tianjin Branch of the North China Electric Power Company carried out a major overhaul in August last year, due to the mobilization of all workers to democratically discuss and formulate plans, it completed the work task in 20 days that took 45 days in the past during the enemy and puppet period. The Shijiazhuang Coking Plant has broken the production record of the past 20 years in coking production due to the mobilization of workers' production enthusiasm. Regarding how to specifically organize production competitions and create new record movements, Lüda's experience is: 1. Reasonably organize labor force and constantly adjust it with the development of the movement. 2. Leaders should go deep into the masses, help workers solve and overcome problems that occur in their work, and summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner. 3. The administrative system must quickly keep up with the development of the new record creation movement, and all production plans, inspection systems, and raw material supplies must be coordinated in a timely manner. The experience of Nanjing Radio Factory in organizing production competitions is: 1. Precise organization of labor, 2. Timely inspection and commendation, 3. Unity and mutual assistance among employees, 4. Guarantee of trade union work.

　　After the award ceremony for labor models in various places, it greatly encouraged labor models, new record creators, and workers of various public enterprises, greatly stimulated their enthusiasm for labor, and further improved their class consciousness. Li Qingrong, a labor hero from the Lüda Railway Bureau, said that in 1950, he would train a large number of male and female train drivers and enable female drivers to master driving skills independently before the "March 8th" International Women's Day. He proposed to create a new record of no accidents in 800 trains, and to make each locomotive reach a traction capacity of 200 tons, and ensure that passenger trains arrive and depart on time. Hao Wanxiang, a tool model creator from the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, said at the model conference: "In the old society, I was never treated as a human being. Today, under the training and help of the Communist Party, I have become a labor model, especially a glorious Communist Party member. I must respond to the call of the superiors, be neither arrogant nor impetuous, unite all the workers, study technology, and further create more wealth for the country." Many workers who were not selected as models also expressed that they are willing to learn from advanced producers and strive to make contributions to the people in industrial production.

　　东北华北等地公营企业召开劳动模范大会  交流先进生产经验
    【本报讯】综合消息：为交流先进经验，进一步推动恢复与发展工业生产，胜利展开一九五○年经济建设工作，东北、华北、华东等地各国营、公营企业纷纷召开劳动模范大会，奖励工业生产中的劳动模范、新纪录创造者、合理化建议者及优秀的技术人员、管理人员。旅大各公营企业工厂，在新年前后即普遍召开了职工模范大会，总结一九四九年工作，研究一九五○年的生产任务，并奖励模范及合理化建议者。东北人民政府工业部曾于一月二十三日通报奖励了公营企业中七十五名领导干部、技术人员、工人和职员，除各厂矿予以物质奖励外，工业部并按照他们对生产贡献的大小，发给奖章奖状。
    在华北的天津、太原、石家庄、张家口，华东的南京、济南、青岛等大中城市大部或部分国营公营企业，亦先后在今年一二月间，举行了劳动模范大会，总结与交流了开展生产运动和模范生产者的先进经验。
    各地在总结先进经验中一致证明，必须彻底依靠工人阶级，实行民主化管理，高度发挥工人阶级的集体智慧，同时实行严格的经济核算制度，才能使生产力不断提高。东北各国营公营工厂矿山在实行民主化管理以后，在工人阶级觉悟提高的基础上开展了创新纪录运动，据四个月不完全统计，出现生产新纪录万余件。部分工厂矿山超过了伪满时代的生产水平。华北电业公司天津分公司第一发电所，在去年八月进行大检修时，由于发动全体工人民主讨论，订计划，二十天完成了过去敌伪时期四十五天才能完成的工作任务。石家庄炼焦厂由于发挥了工人生产积极性，使炼焦生产量突破了二十余年来的生产纪录。对于如何具体组织生产竞赛与创造新纪录运动，旅大的经验是：一、合理组织劳动力，随着运动的发展并不断进行调整。二、领导要深入群众，帮助工人解决与克服工作中所发生的问题，及时总结与推广先进经验。三、行政制度要很快跟上创新纪录运动的发展，一切生产计划、检查制度、原材料供给等都要及时予以配合。南京有线电厂组织生产竞赛的经验则是：一、精密组织劳力，二、及时检查表扬，三、职工团结互助，四、工会工作保证。
    各地经过奖励模范大会后，对劳动模范、新纪录创造者及各公营企业工人以莫大的鼓舞，大大激发了他们的劳动热情，进一步提高了阶级觉悟。旅大铁路局劳动英雄李庆荣表示，在一九五○年要培养大批的火车男女司机，在“三八”节前使女司机们都能单独掌握驾驶技术。他提出要做到创造八○○次列车不出一次事故的新纪录，并使每辆机车达到二百吨的牵引量，旅客列车不误点定时开、定时到。张家口纸烟厂创造工具模范郝万祥在模范大会上说：“在旧社会我从没被别人当人看待。今天在共产党的培养和帮助之下，竟成了劳动模范，尤其成了一个光荣的共产党员。我一定要响应上级的号召，不骄不躁，团结全体工友，钻研技术，更进一步为国家创造更多的财富。许多没有当选模范的工人也纷纷表示，愿向先进生产者看齐，争取在工业生产中为人民立功。
