　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government has issued a notice to the Finance Departments and Tax Bureaus of major administrative regions in Guannei, the directly subordinate provinces and municipalities and tax bureaus of the Central Government, and the People's Autonomous Government of Inner Mongolia and tax bureaus, regarding the payment of industrial and commercial tax by public enterprises:

　　The Ministry convened a joint meeting of the Ministries of Railways, Communications, Posts and Telecommunications, Trade, Fuel, Food, Textile, and Light and Heavy Industries, and the People's Bank on March 14 to discuss the issue of taxation of public enterprises. In addition to implementing the "Measures for Public Enterprises to Pay Industrial and Commercial Tax" promulgated by the Government Administration Council, the following resolutions were made:

　　(1) In North China in 1949, the business tax and income tax of public enterprises in Beijing and Tianjin will be calculated separately and collected together. In Shanxi, Pingyuan, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, only income tax will be levied (no tax was levied on railways, banks, and posts and telecommunications in North China in 1949). Other regions will levy taxes according to the original regulations of each major administrative region.

　　(2) Starting from 1950, the income tax of public enterprises nationwide will be uniformly treated as profit and remitted to the Central Ministry of Finance by their competent departments (enterprises under local management will be remitted to local finance departments). The business tax, except for railways which can be remitted to the Central Ministry of Finance by the Ministry of Railways, will be paid locally by all other enterprises.

　　(3) The taxes of public enterprises in 1949 shall be paid starting from March 20, and must be paid in full by the end of March. If, before March 20, they have already been fully remitted to the finance department as profit, or have been approved by the Central Financial and Economic Commission to be transferred to 1950 as investment, they will no longer be taxed. The business tax payable for January and February 1950 shall also be paid starting from March 20 and must be paid in full by the end of March. Subsequent tax payments shall be made monthly and paid before the 7th of the following month in accordance with the regulations of the Government Administration Council. Late payments will be subject to a daily surcharge for overdue payments, and those who refuse to comply will be subject to disciplinary action.

　　(4) For trade and industrial departments, those who transfer materials in accordance with the orders of the Central Financial and Economic Commission or its competent department in order to stabilize prices or adjust funds, and have solid proof, may be exempt from business tax. General business transfers shall still be taxed (specific measures will be determined separately). Enterprises that have completed their closure, the transferred materials can be exempt from business tax. Trade departments acting on behalf of the finance department to sell goods and supplying retail companies and cooperatives with goods are subject to business tax.

　　(5) For old inventory materials in the warehouses of various enterprise units, if they are taxable goods and have not been subject to goods tax in the past, the tax payment bookkeeping method may be temporarily adopted, without collecting cash, and the Central Financial and Economic Commission will make a final decision during the inventory of warehouses.

　　财政部发出关于公营企业缴纳工商业税的通知
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府财政部顷就公营企业缴纳工商业税向关内各大行政区财政部及税局，中央直辖各省市政府及税局，内蒙人民自治政府及税局发出通知：
    本部于三月十四日召开铁道、交通、邮电、贸易、燃料、食品、纺织及轻、重工业各部、人民银行联席会议，讨论公营企业征税问题，除根据政务院公布之公营企业缴纳工商业税办法执行外，并作如下决议：
    （一）华北一九四九年京津两市公营企业营业税与所得税，分别计算，合并征收，山西、平原、河北、察哈尔、绥远五省，只征所得税（四九年华北铁路、银行、邮电不征），其他各地均按各大区原来规定征收。
    （二）一九五零年起，全国公营企业之所得税，一律作为利润，由其主管部门集中向中央财政部交纳（属地方管理之企业，则向地方财政部门交纳），其营业税除铁路可由铁道部集中向中央财政部交纳外，其他各企业均就地交纳。
    （三）一九四九年公营企业之税，均从三月二十日开始交，限三月底交清，如在三月二十日前，已作为利润全部交归财政、或经中财委批准转为五零年投资者，可不再征税。一九五零年一、二月份应交之营业税，亦从三月二十日交起三月底交清。以后税款按月交纳，并依政务院规定，应于下月七日前交清。逾限者按日加征滞纳金，拒不执行者受纪律处分。
    （四）贸易及工业部门，凡因稳定物价或调整资金，依中财委或其主管部命令进行调拨物资，并有切实证明者，可免营业税，一般业务上调拨仍应照纳（具体办法另定）。办理结束之企业，其移交物资可免营业税。贸易部门代财政变卖物资及供给零售公司、合作社之货物，均纳营业税。
    （五）各企业单位仓库旧存物资，凡属应税货物而过去未纳货物税者，可暂采用纳税记账办法，不收现金，俟中财委在清理仓库中再作最后处理。
