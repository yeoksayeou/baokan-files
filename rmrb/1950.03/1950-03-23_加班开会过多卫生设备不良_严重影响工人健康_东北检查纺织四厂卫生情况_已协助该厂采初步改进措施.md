Xinhua News Agency, 21st -- According to the Worker's Daily here today: Following the joint Tianjin factory hygiene inspection by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Hygiene Department of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Labor Bureau, the Women Workers' Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northeast Textile Federation of Trade Unions also formed a joint hygiene inspection team. On February 24th, they conducted a ten-day key hygiene inspection at the Northeast No. 4 Textile Factory. The results revealed that the factory's leadership paid extremely poor attention to worker hygiene and should make rapid improvements.

The factory currently has more than 2,900 employees. Last year, the incidence of illness accounted for 10% of the total number of employees. This year, in January, an average of 38 full-time workers took sick leave every day. This hygiene inspection team specifically examined the health of 832 employees and found that as many as 759 were ill. Among them, 401 suffered from respiratory diseases, nearly half of the employees examined; 277 suffered from joint diseases (mostly arthritis); and more seriously, there were a particularly large number of workers suffering from chronic lung diseases. Others suffered from digestive system diseases, gynecological diseases, etc. Only 73 workers were completely healthy.

The main reasons for this high number of illnesses among employees are, first, that the factory's working hours are too long, and second, that there are too many meetings. Since the factory changed its working hours from nine to ten hours last December, the phenomenon of overtime has not stopped; in addition, the time taken up by meetings and other activities has made workers very tired. In particular, some advanced workers who create new records are even more tired than ordinary workers. According to the results of this health check, among the 27 model workers who created new records, 26 suffered from various diseases, and only one was healthy.

The sanitary conditions in the workshops are also very poor. For example, the temperature in the workshops is too high, and it is very cold when leaving the workshops, which easily causes workers to catch colds. Dust and cotton wool fly around in the workshops, and there is no ventilation equipment. Most workers who bring their own meals eat in such workshops. Respiratory diseases mainly occur in this way. The drinking water equipment in the workshops is also not perfect, and workers mostly drink water directly from the taps. The workshops are mostly cement floors, and night shift workers sleep on the cold and damp cement floors during rest periods, so workers commonly suffer from arthritis.

In terms of medical care, although the clinic has four doctors (including the director), nine nurses, dispensers, pharmacists, and registration clerks, etc., due to a lack of active prevention and only passive treatment, there is always the phenomenon of many patients and few busy medical staff. Female workers account for about one-third of the total number of employees in the factory, but the clinic has no gynecologist, and women's diseases are not treated.

In the workers' canteen, sick and healthy people eat at the same table and share bowls and chopsticks, and the chopsticks are not rinsed with boiling water. The canteen generally does not have spittoons, so there is phlegm everywhere. Due to poor management, the workers' nutrition is insufficient. According to the doctors' statistical reports, each person lacks more than 800 calories per day.

The sanitation of water sources and bathhouses also needs to be improved. The factory has its own tap water, the water source of which is a ditch, which is very unclean. It is not filtered or disinfected after extraction, and workers often drink cold water. The entire factory with more than 2,000 people has only two bathhouses. The pools are small and the water is shallow, each bath can only accommodate more than 30 people, and the water is only changed once a day, which easily spreads diseases.

The workers' dormitories are very dilapidated, ventilated on all sides, and too cold to sleep in at night. Zhang Jingcai, a worker in the weaving workshop, cannot work due to tracheitis, but he is unwilling to return to the dormitory to rest and still stays in the workshop.

The sanitary conditions of the nurseries are even worse. The twelve nannies have not received childcare training, do not understand hygiene knowledge, and do not care about the children. Sixty children share three rice bowls, one small spoon, and one leaky washbasin, and their clothes and bedding are dirty. Three face towels are shared, which are black and dirty. Most of the children in care develop big bellies and thin legs, and have sores around their eyes. Workers reflect that "the nursery is a crying place."

Establish a Workers' Sanatorium; Limit Overtime

After understanding the situation, the inspection team has assisted the factory in making some improvements. A welfare section has been established administratively, directly led by the deputy director. On the trade union side, labor insurance work has been strengthened, and an enlarged meeting of the factory's labor insurance committee was held on March 2nd, deciding to establish a sanatorium. It was approved by the administration on the 4th and began to admit patients. The first batch has admitted 20 people, most of whom are new record creators and workers with very weak bodies. The food standard for workers in the sanatorium is 90 cents per month, of which they pay 30 cents themselves, and the rest is subsidized by the labor insurance fund. Regarding the issue of overtime, it has been decided that: 1. Overtime must be approved by the trade union. 2. Fragmented overtime (i.e., starting early and stopping late) is absolutely prohibited. 3. Child laborers and pregnant women over five months are absolutely not allowed to work overtime. It has been decided to find a new site for the nursery and strengthen its internal facilities. In addition, the inspection team has put forward preliminary improvement opinions on issues such as masks, drinking water in the workshops, food adjustment, heating in toilets, and dormitory repairs. The inspection team is now still sorting out the materials in detail, preparing to propose further improvement measures.

　　加班开会过多卫生设备不良
    严重影响工人健康
    东北检查纺织四厂卫生情况  已协助该厂采初步改进措施
    【新华社二十一日讯】据今日此间工人日报载：继中央人民政府劳动部及中华全国总工会等联合举行天津工厂卫生检查之后，东北人民政府工业部卫生处、东北劳动总局、东北总工会女工部及东北纺织总工会等联合组成的卫生检查组，亦于二月二十四日在东北纺织第四厂，进行了十天的重点卫生检查，结果发现该厂领导机构对工人卫生注意极差，应迅速改进。
    该厂现有职工二千九百余人，患病率去年占全体职工总数百分之十。今年一月份平均每日请病假的为三十八个整工。这次卫生检查组特地检查了八百三十二个职工的身体，结果发现有病的竟达七百五十九人之多，其中患呼吸器官病者达四百零一人，几等于受检查职工的半数；患关节病者（多为关节炎）达二百七十七人；而更严重的是患慢性肺病的工人特别多。其他为消化系病、妇科病等。身体完全健康的工人仅有七十三名。
    造成职工这种疾病数字的主要原因，首先是该厂的工作时间过长，其次是开会时间过多。该厂自去年十二月工作时间由九小时改为十小时后，加班现象仍未停止；再加上开会等占用时间，以致工人十分疲劳，特别是一些创造新纪录的先进工作者，比一般工人更为劳累。据这次健康检查的结果，在二十七名创造新纪录的模范中，患各种病者二十六人，身体健康的仅一人。
    车间工房卫生状况亦很不好，如车间温度太高，离开车间就很冷，极易引起工人伤风感冒。车间内尘土棉絮乱飞，没有通风设备。大部带饭工人，就在这样的车间中吃饭。呼吸系统的病主要便是这样发生的。车间饮水设备也不完善，工人多就龙头喝水。车间多是洋灰地，夜班工人休息时便睡在又冷又潮的洋灰地上，因此工人们普遍患关节炎。
    医疗方面，卫生所虽有医生四人（所长在内），护士、调剂员、司药、药剂师、挂号员等九人，但因缺乏积极预防，只是消极医治，所以老是有病人多、医务员少而忙碌的现象。全厂女工占职工总数三分之一左右，但卫生所却无妇科医生，妇女病无人医治。
    工人食堂中病人与健康的人同桌吃饭，共用碗筷，而筷子又不用开水冲洗。食堂中普遍未设痰盂，以致到处是痰。伙食因管理不善，工人营养不够，据医生的统计报告，每人每日缺乏热量达八百余卡罗里。
    水源和浴池的卫生也待改善。该厂自设自来水，水源为一河沟，很不清洁，吸取后又没经沙滤消毒，而工人还常喝冷水。全厂二千余人仅有浴池两个，池小水浅，每次入浴仅容三十余人，一日仅换水一次，极易传染疾病。
    工人宿舍十分破烂，四面通风，夜间更是冷得不能睡觉。织布场工人张景才，因气管炎不能工作，但却不愿回宿舍休息，仍然待在工房。
    托儿所的卫生情况更为恶劣。褓姆十二名，都未有受过育儿训练，既不懂卫生常识，对小孩又不关心。六十几个小孩，共用三个饭碗，一把小匙，一个漏水的脸盆，衣被也肮脏不堪。洗脸手巾共用三条，黑而且脏。大部分受托小孩弄成大肚细腿，烂眼边。工人反映说：“托儿所就是哭儿所”。
    设工人疗养所  限制加班加点
    检查组了解情况后，已协助该厂作了一些改进，行政上已成立福利科，由副厂长直接领导。工会方面，已加强劳动保险工作，并于三月二日召开全厂劳动保险委员扩大会议，决定成立疗养所，并已于四日获得行政同意，开始收容病人。第一批已收容二十人，其中多为新纪录创造者及身体十分衰弱的工人。在疗养所的工人伙食标准为九十分一月，除自己拿出三十分外，余下概由劳动保险基金补助。关于加班加点问题，已决定：一、加班一定要经工会同意。二、零碎加点（即早开车晚停车）绝对禁止。三、童工及五个月以上的孕妇绝对不加班加点。托儿所则决定另找新址，充实内部。此外关于口罩、车间喝水、伙食调剂、厕所加暖、宿舍修建等问题，检查组都提出了初步改进意见。检查组现在还在详细整理材料，准备提出更进一步的改善办法。
