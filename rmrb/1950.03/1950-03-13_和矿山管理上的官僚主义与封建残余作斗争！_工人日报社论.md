　　Fight Against Bureaucracy and Feudal Remnants in Mine Management!
    ——Worker's Daily Editorial

　　Representatives of coal mine trade unions from all over the country have told us that there is a serious phenomenon of bureaucracy in the coal mine management work in most parts of the country, which is suffocating coal mine production, wasting huge amounts of wealth, and causing terrible disasters to occur continuously; and more seriously, the foremen and supervisors of the old bureaucratic capital ruling era are still rampant and domineering, and the workers are still suffering from their oppression, living a life like slaves and beasts, and there is no question of participating in the democratic management of the mines. Moreover, as the coal mine, which is the mother of industrial production, is mostly located in mountainous areas far from central cities, and coal mine production is carried out underground, the serious problems brewing in it are often not easily noticed; but once they erupt into disasters, they cause incalculable losses to the country's wealth, workers' lives, and the work of restoring and developing industrial production. What a serious problem this is!

　　Why are we so determined to implement the democratization of industrial and mining management? It is because we are a country led by the working class, and the working class should be the masters of the country, as well as the masters of all state-owned and public factories, mines, and enterprises; it is because the broad masses of workers have years of production experience and abundant wisdom, and we must inspire the masses of workers to bring these experiences and wisdom into play with the identity of the masters of the state's industrial and mining enterprises, combine them with specialized technical personnel with scientific knowledge, manage our industrial and mining enterprises better, and increase production higher. We must take full responsibility for the country's industrial and mining production. The difference between our principles for managing industrial and mining enterprises and those of bureaucratic capital lies in this. But what is the current management situation in these mines? The principles they implement are completely contrary to the principles stipulated by the state! They inherit the set of feudal and dark rule of the Kuomintang lock, stock and barrel, they still believe in those people who provide “three insurances and four eats,” and even degenerate to the point of treating workers as less than human, kicking them, tying them with ropes, whipping them, and branding them with iron. Since they in fact only believe that the feudal rule of bureaucratic capital is good, since they have preserved the old foreman system and subcontracting big counters, and treated the old foremen and supervisors as their confidants; since they regard the workers as not their family members, but only slaves for them to drive and whip, what democracy is there to speak of? Since the workers are forced to live under dark rule, at the mercy of the original foremen and supervisors, often dying miserably in hundreds, what conscious attitude of being masters and enthusiasm for production can there be to speak of? Therefore, if we do not resolutely transform this bureaucratic ideological stance that is getting farther and farther away from the working class, it is difficult to talk about improving the management of the mines. Therefore, these serious phenomena in coal mine management cannot be explained merely by a general lack of experience in managing enterprises, but by a struggle between the democratic management line that relies on the working class and the feudal remnant forces that rely on enslaving and oppressing the working class.

　　It has been more than three years since the liberation of the Northeast mining area, nearly two years since the liberation of the East China mining area, one year since the liberation of the North China mining area, and nearly half a year since the liberation of the Central South mining area; the time cannot be said to be too short, and the policies were promulgated even earlier. But until today, the problem is still so serious, and disasters continue to occur. This is really not a small matter that can be put aside after a general review, but a major event related to the fundamental lifeline of the country's industrial construction, the coal mining sector. This matter should not only be seriously noted by coal mine administrators and trade union workers, but also by the whole country. We must immediately correct bureaucracy, resolutely and systematically change all the unreasonable and bad systems of the original bureaucratic capital enterprises, conscientiously implement democratic management, and establish mine management committees to inspire the class consciousness of the workers and rely on the workers to improve coal mine production.

### 和矿山管理上的官僚主义与封建残余作斗争！——工人日报社论

　　和矿山管理上的官僚主义与封建残余作斗争！
    ——工人日报社论
    全国各地煤矿工会代表告诉我们：目前全国大部地区的煤矿管理工作上，存在着严重的官僚主义现象，使得煤矿的生产被窒塞着，巨量的财富在浪费着，可怕的灾祸连续发生；而更严重的则是，过去官僚资本统治时代的把头监工仍然横行霸道，工人们依然受着他们的压迫，过着奴隶牛马一般的生活，根本谈不上什么参加矿山的民主管理。加以作为发展工业生产之母的煤矿，又多半处在距离中心城市较远的山区，煤矿生产又是在地下进行，其中酝酿着的严重问题，往往不容易被人注意；但是一旦发为灾祸，就使国家财富，工人身命，以及恢复与发展工业生产的工作遭致不可计量的损失。这是一个多么严重的问题！
    我们为什么坚决要实行工矿管理民主化呢？就因为我们是工人阶级领导的国家，工人阶级应该是国家的主人，也是一切国营公营工厂矿山企业的主人；就在于广大工人群众有积年累月的生产经验与丰富智慧，我们必须启发工人群众以国家工矿主人翁的身份，把这些经验与智慧发挥起来，结合上有科学知识的专门技术人材，把我们的工矿管理得更好，把生产提得更高。我们对国家的工矿生产事业要负完全的责任。我们管理工矿的原则和官僚资本不同的地方，就在于此。而这些矿山目前的管理情况是怎样的呢？他们所施行的原则跟国家规定的原则完全相反！他们原封不动的继承着国民党封建黑暗统治的一套，他们照旧相信着那些“三保险，四吃开”的人，连他们自己也蜕化到把工人不当人待，脚踢绳吊，鞭打铁烙。他们既然在事实上只相信官僚资本的封建统治是好的，既然把旧的把头制、包工大柜等保存下来，把旧的把头监工当作自己的亲信；既然把工人当作不是他们的一家人，只是供他们驱迫鞭打的奴隶，这还有什么民主可言？工人既然被迫处于黑暗统治之下，一任原来的把头监工摆布，动辄成百惨死，还有什么自觉的主人翁的劳动态度与生产积极性可言？所以，如果不把这种离开工人阶级越来越远的官僚主义的思想立场，加以坚决的改造，矿山的管理是很难说到改善的。因此，煤矿管理中的这些严重现象就不仅是一般的缺乏管理企业的经验所能解释，而是一个依靠工人阶级的民主管理路线与依靠奴役压迫工人阶级的封建残余势力作斗争的问题。
    东北矿区的解放已过三年，华东矿区的解放已近二年，华北矿区已解放一年，中南矿区解放也将近半年；时间都不能说是太短，政策颁布的更早。但是直到今日为止，问题还这样严重，灾祸还不断发生，这真不是一件可以一般地检讨一下就丢开的小事，这是关系着国家工业建设根本命脉的煤矿部门的重大事件。这事情不仅应为煤矿行政管理者与工会工作者所严重注意，而且应为全国上下所注意。我们必须立即纠正官僚主义，必须坚决的有步骤的改变原来官僚资本企业的一切不合理的恶劣制度，切实实行管理民主化，建立矿山管理委员会，以启发工人的阶级觉悟，依靠工人来改进煤矿的生产。
