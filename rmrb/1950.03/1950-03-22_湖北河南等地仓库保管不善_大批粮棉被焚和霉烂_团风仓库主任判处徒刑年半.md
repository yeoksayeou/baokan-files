　　Poor Warehouse Management in Hubei, Henan and Other Places
    Large Quantities of Grain and Cotton Burned and Molded
    Warehouse Director of Tuanfeng Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison

    [Reported by this newspaper] Although public grain has mostly been stored in warehouses across various regions, the irresponsibility and carelessness of warehouse personnel in many places have led to continuous incidents of public grain loss. In Shandong, from December of last year to January of this year, incomplete statistics from Luzhongnan, Jiaodong, and Changwei alone show dozens of incidents of mold, theft, and embezzlement of public grain, resulting in a total loss of 37,289 catties. On December 26th of last year, a fire broke out at the Tuanfeng warehouse in Huanggang County, Hubei, due to the irresponsibility of warehouse director Tong Wenqing, burning over 70,000 catties of millet. At the Zhuji Cotton and Grain Warehouse in Henan Province, a fire also occurred because prisoners were used, resulting in the loss of over 60,000 catties of cotton, over 160,000 catties of sesame, and over 66,000 square zhang of homespun cloth. In Sui County, Hubei, 800,000 catties of grain were found to be moldy, another 400,000 catties were generating heat, and 20,000 catties of wheat were infested with insects. While these incidents of public grain loss are due to some objective reasons and difficulties, the main cause is the lack of a high sense of responsibility among warehouse leading cadres for the storage of public grain. They did not seriously and conscientiously inspect the storage of grain, and even casually used prisoners to guard the public grain without investigation. Furthermore, some northern cadres who came to the south did not understand or familiarize themselves with southern methods of storing grain, nor did they humbly learn from the masses to study proper storage methods. Instead, they carelessly placed the grain on the ground, simply covering it with some rice straw. If this phenomenon does not attract serious attention and correction from warehouse leaders, the phenomenon of grain molding and sprouting will become even more widespread with the arrival of the spring rainy season.
    At the same time, leading cadres of local governments should also be held responsible for the incidents of public grain loss in various regions. They should pay attention to timely inspection and supervision of the storage work of public grain warehouses, and take necessary disciplinary actions against warehouse cadres who neglect their duties, according to the specific circumstances. The Hubei Provincial Government has issued a circular to punish those responsible for the fire incident at the Tuanfeng warehouse in Huanggang, namely: the warehouse director Tong Wenqing was sentenced to one and a half years in prison, the head of the county's Finance Section, Song Chao, received a major demerit, the county magistrate was given a warning, the corvee laborer Luo Minghuan was sentenced to one year in prison, and the warehouse worker Gu Yingtou was sentenced to six months in prison. It is hoped that local governments will investigate and appropriately handle other public grain loss incidents in various regions.

　　湖北河南等地仓库保管不善
    大批粮棉被焚和霉烂
    团风仓库主任判处徒刑年半
    【本报讯】各地公粮虽已大部入仓，但许多地方由于保管人员不负责，工作潦草马虎，致使不断发生损失公粮事件。山东去年十二月至今年一月，仅就鲁中南、胶东、昌潍的不完全统计，即连续发生几十次霉烂、被盗、贪污公粮事件，共计损失公粮三万七千二百八十九斤。去年十二月二十六日，湖北黄冈县团风仓库因仓库主任童文卿不负责，失火烧毁谷子七万多斤。河南省朱集棉粮仓库，因为使用犯人，也发生了火灾，损失棉花六万余斤、芝麻十六万余斤、土布六万六千方丈。湖北随县仓库霉烂粮食八十万斤，另有四十万斤已发热，二万斤小麦已生虫。这些损失公粮事件的发生，虽有很多客观原因与困难，但主要是仓库领导干部缺乏对公粮保管的高度责任心，没有严肃认真的检查粮食的存放，甚至不经考察随便使用犯人看管公粮。而有些北方干部到南方，不了解不熟习南方存放粮食的方法，也不虚心向群众学习，研究妥善存放办法，只是马马虎虎把粮食放在地上，铺一点稻草就算了。这种现象如不引起仓库领导同志严重注意与纠正，春雨季节一到，粮食霉烂生芽现象将更会普遍发生。
    同时各地政府领导干部也应对各地公粮损失事件负责。应注意及时检查督促各公粮仓库的保管工作，对玩忽职守的仓库干部，应分别情况给以必要的纪律制裁。现湖北省府已通令处分黄冈团风仓库失火事件负责人员，即：该仓库主任童文卿判处徒刑一年半，该县财政科长宋超记大过一次，该县县长警告一次，民伕罗明宦徒刑一年，仓库工作员顾应托徒刑半年。其他各地公粮损失事件，亦望各地政府检查，给以适当处理。
