Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th: Following the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's conference of Party member cadres from Shanxi's state-owned factories and mines, the Shanxi Provincial Government's Department of Industry convened an enlarged cadre meeting for state-owned factories and mines from the 7th to the 10th of this month. The main purpose of this meeting was to resolve specific issues in the work of enterprise management. According to the review during the meeting, the recovery work of Shanxi's state-owned industry and mining in the past year has been successful. For example, 21 factories and mines have had most or the main part of their products reach pre-war levels, and 6 factories and mines have exceeded pre-war levels. Through steps such as protecting factories, inventorying, resuming work, and evaluating assets, workers have begun to be mobilized; factory management systems have also undergone some improvements, and so on. However, because the military nature of enterprise production under Yan Xishan's rule and its unreasonable production management system have not been thoroughly transformed, serious phenomena such as unclear assets, high costs, and low quality are quite common in various factories and mines, hindering the development of production. According to the meeting's review, a parochialism mindset is quite prevalent among many enterprise cadres, such as concealing funds and equipment, only knowing to ask superiors for things but not obeying unified allocation; among various enterprise units, there are also phenomena of vying for profit and not keeping promises, which has harmed the entire state-owned enterprise. Many enterprises are poorly managed, resulting in a great waste of funds and manpower. For example, some factories do not strive to overcome difficulties caused by high product costs, inventory backlogs, and inflexible capital turnover by promoting sales of finished products and reducing costs, but instead ask their superiors to increase investment, resulting in greater waste of funds. Some factories and mines have too many redundant staff. At Jinsheng Textile Factory, nine people manage two toilets, and the Northwest Cement Factory's clinker car originally used two people to push, but four people were employed. According to preliminary investigations, two-fifths of the staff at Limin Chemical Company could be laid off. In terms of management systems, the old ways have not been quickly changed, affecting the improvement of workers' production efficiency. For example, the feudal foreman system in many coal mines has not yet been completely eliminated.

In response to the above-mentioned serious phenomena, the meeting, based on the basic policy of Shanxi's public enterprises in 1950, proposed that the central task for March and April is to "accurately calculate, preliminarily set quotas, adjust labor organization, and establish and improve new management systems." The specific steps are: first, each factory and mine should convene a factory management committee (or, if not yet established, through the factory affairs committee) and a meeting of worker representatives to discuss and resolve ideological issues related to relying on workers to implement democratic management and enterprise management based on the specific circumstances of the factory or mine. Secondly, based on the central work tasks for March and April determined by the meeting, improve the current unreasonable quotas and re-test and set model quotas; establish systems for requesting instructions and reporting, rewards and punishments, specific responsibilities and inspections, and statistical reports; and then adjust labor organization to overcome the phenomenon of bloated and oversized production institutions.

　　山西省工业厅扩大干部会议
    决定改进企业经营管理
    三四月份要重新试定示范定额
    【新华社二十九日讯】太原讯：继中共山西省委会召开山西省营厂矿的党员干部会议之后，山西省政府工业厅又于本月七日至十日召开了省营厂矿扩大干部会议。这次会议主要是解决经营企业化工作中的若干具体问题。据会议中的检查，山西省营工矿业去年的恢复工作是有成绩的。如已有二十一个厂矿大部或主要的产品达到战前水平，有六个厂矿则超过战前水平。经过护厂、清点、复工、评资等工作步骤，工人已经开始发动起来；工厂管理制度也有若干改进等等。但是，由于阎锡山统治下企业生产的军事性及其不合理的生产管理制度没有得到彻底改造，各厂矿相当普遍地存在着资财不清、成本高、质量低等严重现象，阻碍着生产的发展。据会议检查，许多企业干部中相当普遍地存在着本位主义思想，如隐瞒资金器材，只知道向上级要东西而不知服从统一调拨；在各企业单位之间，也有相互争利、不守信用的现象，以致使整个省营企业遭受损害。许多企业经营不善，形成资金、人力的极大浪费。如有些工厂不从推销成品、减低成本等方面去努力克服因产品成本太高、成品积压、资金周转不灵的困难，却一味向上级要求增加投资，结果形成更大的资金浪费。有些厂矿则冗员太多。晋生纺织厂九个人管理二个厕所，西北洋灰厂的熟料车本来用二个人推，却用了四个人。据初步调查，利民化学公司有五分之二的人员是可以裁减的。在管理制度方面，旧的一套仍未迅速改变，影响着工人生产效率的提高。如很多煤矿的封建把头制迄今仍未完全取消。
    针对上述严重现象，会议根据山西省公营企业一九五○年的基本方针，提出了三四月份的中心工作是做到“精确计算，初步定额，调整劳力组织，建立与健全新的管理制度。”其具体进行步骤是：各厂矿首先召开工厂管理委员会（尚未建立的，经过厂务委员会）及职工代表会议，根据本厂矿具体情况讨论和解决有关依靠工人实行民主管理及经营企业化的思想问题。其次是根据会议决定的三四月份的中心工作任务，改进现在的不合理定额，重新试定示范定额；建立请示报告、奖惩、专责与检查、统计表报等制度；然后调整劳动组织，克服生产机构臃肿庞大的现象。
