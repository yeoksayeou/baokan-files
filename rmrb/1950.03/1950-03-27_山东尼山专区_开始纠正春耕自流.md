　　Shandong Nishan Special District
    Begins to Correct the Spontaneous Spring耕
    [News from this newspaper] This newspaper's special correspondent Zhang Linfu reports: The Nishan Special District of Shandong Province has begun to correct the spontaneous state of spring plowing. Since the beginning of spring, spring plowing production in the Nishan area, with the exception of the old areas of Pingyi, Sishui, and Baiyan, which have leadership and are organized, most other areas are in a spontaneous state. In order to correct this phenomenon, the local CCP committee of the district held a joint meeting of county party secretaries in early March to conduct research and, based on the situation in various places, made a decision to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing. First, a thorough mobilization for spring plowing production should be carried out, explaining that the current spring plowing production is the central task, and the mistake of only engaging in disaster relief without leading spring plowing should be quickly corrected; also prevent the bias of only engaging in spring plowing without combining it with disaster relief. When mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to educate party members and village cadres to truly take the lead and resolutely implement the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy of mutual aid in labor exchange. At the same time, it is necessary to break the concerns of households with cattle, help them solve their difficulties, and get the livestock to plow the fields. For landlords and rich peasants, explain the prospect of abiding by the law and labor reform, and require them to plant their land. The mobilization of the masses cannot be limited to verbal propaganda, and practical problems must be solved in connection. In addition to holding mass rallies, the mobilization methods can also be combined with holding village and township people's representative meetings, forums for people's representatives or production teams, as well as forums for cattle owners, military families, landlords, rich peasants, etc., to conduct in-depth education based on different ideological situations.
    Second, regarding the organization in spring plowing production: (1) Mutual aid teams mainly based on cattle power should be voluntarily combined by households with and without cattle. Mutual aid teams mainly based on human power can organize labor and combine agriculture with sideline occupations; however, they lack animal power, so in order to complete the urgent task of spring plowing in the new district, mutual aid teams mainly based on cattle power should be universally organized to carry out spring plowing with all their strength. (3) In areas where cattle power is lacking, the organization should focus on people pulling plows and cattle sharing plows, and mobilize women to participate in field production. (4) Other erroneous methods: such as compiling all the livestock in the village into a spring plowing brigade to uniformly cultivate the land, giving priority to military families, then poor peasants, and then cattle owners; or organizing groups according to the area where they live, with the cattle in that area plowing that area's land; or assigning designated households to allocate cattle to plow a certain amount of land, etc., are all wrong and should be immediately prohibited.
    Third, the following should be firmly grasped in spring plowing production: (1) Spring plowing must be combined with disaster relief. This has been achieved in Renjiaqiao in Ziyang and Gonglizhuang in Pingyi: first, both the district and the village have special personnel to lead spring plowing or sideline occupations, and promptly check and solve problems. Mobilize women to engage in sideline occupations to earn food rations, and ensure that male laborers are engaged in spring plowing. For example, households without cattle can contract their land to households with cattle at a labor price, and specialize in sideline occupations. Or divide the labor of spring plowing and sideline occupations within the mutual aid team. (2) Resolutely implement the policy of protecting cattle: the use of cattle must be compensated with labor and grass, and the amount of compensation can be determined by the masses themselves. Villages with few cattle should organize people to plow or buy cattle together. Leaders at all levels must grasp the key points, thoroughly implement the investigation of cattle, households, and land, and effectively promote spring plowing.

　　山东尼山专区
    开始纠正春耕自流
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员张林夫报道：山东尼山专区开始纠正春耕自流状态。入春以来，尼山区春耕生产，除平邑、泗水、白彦等老区有领导有组织的进行外，其余大部地区处于自流状态。为纠正这样现象，该区中共地委特于三月上旬召开县委书记联席会议，进行研究，根据各地情况，作出加强春耕领导的决定。第一、深入进行春耕生产动员，讲明目前春耕生产是中心任务，迅速纠正光搞救灾，不领导春耕的错误；也防止只搞春耕不与救灾结合的偏向。向群众宣传动员时，要教育党员村干部真正带头，坚决执行变工互助的自愿互利政策。同时要打破有牛户的顾虑，帮助其解决困难，使牲口上犋耕地。对地主富农，说明其守法与劳动改造的前途，并要他们一定把地种上。向群众动员不能只限于口头宣传，必须连系解决实际问题。动员的方式，除召开群众大会，还可配合召开村乡人民代表会议、人民代表或生产小组座谈会，以及有牛户、军属、地主、富农……各种座谈会，根据不同思想情况进行深入教育。
    第二、关于春耕生产中的组织：（一）以牛力为主的互助组，有牛户与无牛户自愿结合。以人力为主的互助组，能把劳力组织起来，使农业与副业相结合；但是缺乏畜力，所以在新区要完成迫切的春耕任务，应普遍组织以牛力为主互助组，全力进行春耕。（三）在牛力缺乏地区，以组织人拉犁、牛配犋为主，并发动广大妇女参加田间生产。（四）其他几种错误办法：如把全村牲口编成春耕大队，统一耕地，先军属、后贫农、再才是牛主；或按住的片编组，那片牛耕那片地；或按户指定，分配牛犋耕一定土地等，都是错误的，应马上禁止。
    第三、春耕生产中应切实掌握：（一）春耕必须与救灾结合。这在滋阳任家桥、平邑巩利庄已作出成绩：首先是区与村都有专人领导春耕或副业，及时检查、解决问题。发动妇女搞副业挣口粮，保证男劳力春耕。再如无牛户出工价把地包给有牛户，自己专搞副业。或在互助组内把春耕和副业分工进行。（二）坚决贯彻护牛政策：使用牛一定要还工还草，还工还草数目可由群众自己商定。牛少的村庄应组织人耕或合伙买牛。各级领导要掌握重点，深入贯彻查牛、查户、查地，切实推动春耕。
