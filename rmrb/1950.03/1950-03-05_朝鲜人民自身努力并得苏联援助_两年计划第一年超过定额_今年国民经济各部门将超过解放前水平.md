　　Thanks to the efforts of the Korean working people and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, all sectors of the North Korean national economy have overfulfilled the quota for the first year (1949) of the two-year plan and will surpass pre-liberation levels this year.

　　At the Fifth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea on February 25, Jeong Jun-taek, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, reported on the implementation of the first year of the two-year plan as follows:

　　　　Total Industrial Output
　　　　Exceeds Annual Plan
　　In industry: In 1949, total industrial output in North Korea exceeded the annual production plan by 2.8%. It exceeded the 1948 industrial level by 39%. Mining, building materials industry, and machinery industry exceeded the annual plan by 15% to 30%. The production of mining, electricity, building materials and other departments, led by the machinery industry and light industry, has exceeded 75% of the pre-liberation (1944) level.

　　　　Overcoming Severe Drought
　　　　Grain and Cotton Production Increases
　　In agriculture: In 1949, a severe drought was overcome. Compared with 1944, coarse grains increased by more than 626,000 tons, rice increased by more than 109,000 tons, and cotton increased by more than 45,000 tons.

　　The transportation and trade sectors both exceeded the plan.

　　Last year, the government used a huge budget to undertake large-scale basic construction projects. Due to the construction and restoration of various basic construction projects, the production of pig iron, alloy iron, ships, electric motors, synthetic petroleum and other items increased by one and a half to four times compared with 1948.

　　The material life and cultural level of the working people have also been significantly improved. Last year, wages increased by 15%, and actual wages were greatly increased due to lower prices and improved welfare.

　　In terms of culture and education: Last year, the preparations for the implementation of primary compulsory education were successfully completed. The number of students in people's schools, middle schools, and universities exceeded the quota of the two-year plan in just one year.

　　Jeong Jun-taek emphasized in the report that the important factors for the overfulfillment of last year's economic plan were the enthusiastic production competition of all the working people in North Korea, and the selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union in accordance with the "Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Mutual Assistance Agreement" in supplying Korea with various industrial equipment, raw materials, and technology.

　　　　This Year's Goals
　　Jeong Jun-taek put forward the following production plan goals for this year: the total production of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and private enterprises should increase by 45.9% compared with 1949; while state-owned enterprises should increase by 58%. In agriculture, the total harvest of grains should increase by 16.4%. The increase in transport should be 13.8%. The turnover of commodities will increase by 23% compared with last year.

　　Jeong Jun-taek pointed out that after completing the above general goals, the entire economy of North Korea will be able to exceed the pre-liberation level, overcome the colonial economic bias caused by the Japanese imperialist rule, and move towards the road of independent prosperity and strength. Not only that, the successful completion of the two-year economic plan will lay a solid material foundation for the recovery and development of the bankrupt South Korean economy liberated from the iron heel of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang in the future.

　　朝鲜人民自身努力并得苏联援助
    两年计划第一年超过定额
    今年国民经济各部门将超过解放前水平
    【新华社平壤四日电】由于朝鲜劳动人民的努力和苏联大公无私的援助，朝鲜国民经济各部门已超额完成了两年计划头一年（一九四九年）的定额，并将在今年超过解放前的水平。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会委员长郑准泽，于二月二十五日在朝鲜最高人民会议第五届会议上报告两年计划头一年的执行情况如下：
            全部工业产量
            超过全年计划
    工业方面：一九四九年，北朝鲜的全部工业产量，超过了全年生产计划的百分之二·八。超过一九四八年的工业水平百分之三十九。矿业、建筑材料工业和机械工业，超过全年计划的百分之十五到三十。以机械工业和轻工业为首的矿业、电气和建筑材料等部门的生产，均已超过解放前（一九四四年）水平的百分之七十五。
            战胜严重旱灾
            粮棉产量增加
    农业方面：一九四九年战胜了严重的旱灾。与一九四四年比较，杂粮增产六十二万六千余吨，米谷增产十万九千余吨，棉花增产四万五千余吨。
    运输与贸易部门都超过了计划。
    去年，政府曾以巨额预算，从事庞大的基本建设工程。由于各种基本建设工程的建设和恢复，使铣铁、合金铁、船舶、电动机、人造石油等物品的生产量，比一九四八年增加了一倍半至四倍。
    劳动人民的物质生活与文化水平，也有了显著提高。去年，工资增加了百分之十五，由于物价降低及福利事业的增进，又大大地提高了实际工资。
    文化教育方面：去年胜利地完成了实施初等义务教育的准备工作。人民学校、中学和大学的学生数额，在去年一年中已超过了二年计划的定额。
    郑准泽在报告中强调指出：去年经济计划超额完成的重要因素，是北朝鲜全体劳动人民热烈的生产竞赛，和苏联根据“朝苏经济与文化互助协定”，供给朝鲜各种工业设备、原料和技术上的大公无私的援助。
            今年目标
    郑准泽提出今年生产计划的目标如下：国营企业、合作社与私人企业的生产总额，比一九四九年增加百分之四十五·九；而国营企业则应增加百分之五十八。农业方面，谷物的总收获量应增加百分之十六·四。运输方面增加百分之十三·八。商品的流通额将比去年增加百分之二十三。
    郑准泽指出：完成了以上的总目标以后，北朝鲜的整个经济即能超过解放前的水平，并克服日本帝国主义统治时期所造成的殖民地经济的偏枯性，而走向自主富强的道路。不仅如此，二年经济计划的胜利完成，将给今后从美帝国主义与李承晚匪帮铁蹄下解放出来的、破产的南朝鲜经济的恢复与发展，奠下坚固的物质基础。
