　　Establish a Full-Time System for Teachers
    Strengthen the Leadership of Group Leaders

　　During the initial establishment of spare-time schools, many difficulties arose due to a lack of clear guidelines and systems. For example, cadres who enrolled were scattered across various departments, and it was difficult to concentrate on classes during their spare time. The allocation of time between work and study was uneven, and there was a high degree of mobility, with varying levels of proficiency among cadres from different departments. In response to these issues, various organizations proposed solutions to overcome these difficulties: (1) Some teachers were unable to focus on teaching due to multiple concurrent positions, so each organization decided that teachers should primarily be full-time. For example, in Baoding, Tangshan, and other places, full-time teachers were assigned to major courses, and multiple teachers were hired to ensure that part-time teachers only taught one subject. Baoding adopted a method of hiring two teachers, a principal and an assistant, for each course to solve the problem of teachers missing classes due to work. (2) To address the difficulty of schools providing extracurricular guidance due to students living in scattered locations, Tangshan and other places adopted a method of strengthening the leadership of group leaders and assigning teachers according to residential areas to connect with students from various organizations and provide extracurricular guidance. (3) To solve the problem of missed classes due to official duties, two methods were adopted: group assistance and teacher make-up classes, so that students who missed classes could study according to the plan. (4) The solution to the problem of students having different levels of proficiency was to set up various classes and teach according to their level. (5) Regarding school management, all localities organized school management committees to conduct regular leadership. Many places in Hebei adopted a school affairs committee composed of teachers, students, and representatives of organizations to manage the school. Each school also had a dedicated person in charge to ensure the implementation of the teaching plan. In addition, various places paid attention to mobilizing students to democratically formulate study covenants, which everyone consciously abided by. Tangshan also mobilized students to eliminate absenteeism and missed classes, with attendance consistently maintained at over 85 percent.

　　确定教员专任制
    加强小组长领导
    在业余学校开办的时候，由于缺乏明确的方针和制度，曾发生不少困难的问题。如入学的干部分散在各部门工作，要在业余时间集中上课，工作和学习的时间分配不过来，流动性很大，各部门干部程度不齐等等。各机关针对以上情况，提出了克服困难的办法：（一）有些教员因兼职多不能专心教学，各机关就确定教员以专任为原则。如保定、唐山等地以专职教员担任主要课程，并采多聘办法，使兼职教员只担任一种科目；保定曾采用每门课聘正副教员两人的办法，解决教员因工作误课的困难。（二）对学员分散住宿，学校不便进行课外指导的困难，唐山等地曾采取加强对小组长领导的办法，并按居住地区分配教员，以联系各机关学员，进行课外指导。（三）解决因公误课的办法，采取小组互助和教员补课两种办法，使缺课学员能按计划学习。（四）解决学员程度不齐的办法是：分设各种班次，按程度教课。（五）关于学校管理工作，各地都组织学校管理委员会进行经常的领导。河北不少地方采用由教员、学员、机关代表等三方组成的校务委员会来管理。每个学校并另设专人负责，以掌握实现教学计划。此外各地并注意发动学员民主订定学习公约，大家自觉遵守。唐山还发动学员消除旷课、误课现象，到课人数经常保持在百分之八十五以上。
