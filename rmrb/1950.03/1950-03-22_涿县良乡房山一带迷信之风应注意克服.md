To the Editor:

　　I recently traveled through Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, and Fangshan counties on my way to Beijing and observed that in the remote mountain areas of these three counties, superstitious practices are showing a trend of returning to their old ways. The reason for this is that lurking cultists and shamanic witches are creating rumors and fanning the flames. For example, they are spouting nonsense such as "there was a previous Qing, so there will be a later Qing," and "so-and-so is now in power." There are also those who hang robes and sculpt gods, and door gods and kitchen gods are still worshiped. Witches treat illnesses with "medicines" made of cow urine, horse manure, grass roots, and tree bark, killing people as if it were child's play. This is truly intolerable in the new society.

　　Superstition was originally a tool used by reactionary rulers to deceive the people. To allow it to continue to exist in the new society will shake people's hearts and even confuse rural cadres (due to their low education). The harm it causes is truly immeasurable.

　　Yi Pingren

　　Editor's Note: The situation reflected in this letter deserves the attention of leading cadres in all counties. However, superstition cannot be banned by orders alone. To overcome superstitious thinking, we must start with popularizing education, raising the cultural level of the masses, strengthening public health work, and solving the people's living difficulties. Some superstitious groups, if it is确知 known that they are being used by bandits and special agents or are engaging in activities that infringe upon the rights and interests of the people, their ringleaders should be severely punished.

　　涿县良乡房山一带迷信之风应注意克服
    径启者：本人近经涿县、良乡、房山三县来京，见到该三县山僻之区迷信之风有恢复旧日之趋向。其原因乃由于潜伏之邪教徒与跳神之巫婆造谣生事，推波助澜。如胡诌“有前清就有后清”、“现在××××当世”等，并有挂袍塑神者，门神、灶王照常供奉。而巫婆治病，用牛尿、马粪、草根、树皮等作“药”，杀人如儿戏，真是新社会中所不能容许。
    迷信原是反动统治者欺骗人民之工具，新社会依然令其存在，动摇人心，甚至迷惑乡村干部（文化低原故），其为害真不知到何种地步也。

    编者按：这封信所反映的情况是值得各县领导干部注意的。不过，迷信不是单靠命令可以禁止的。克服迷信思想，要从普及教育、提高群众文化水平、并加强卫生工作、解决群众生活困难等方面着手。有些迷信团体，如确知其系受土匪特务所利用或有侵害人民权益的行为，则对其首恶者应予严惩。
