In 1949, most regions of the country successively convened People's Representative Conferences (or People's Congresses) for all sectors of society. The six northeastern provinces systematically convened People's Representative Conferences at the provincial, county, and municipal levels. In North China, East China, and other regions, most cities with populations of over 30,000 and general towns convened People's Representative Conferences. Shandong, Pingyuan, Chahar and other provinces also convened People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses at the district and village levels. In the new rural areas of East China, Central China South and other regions, farmer representative conferences were widely convened. The second People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society convened in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan and other cities have already exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the Municipal People's Government. In the actual political life of the people across the country, a huge democratic wave has been set off. Through this sound democratic system, the people are mobilizing and organizing themselves as masters of their own affairs, assisting the government in overcoming difficulties and completing the tasks of achieving and consolidating victory.

There is no doubt that this is a major political change, marking a leap forward in the development of democratic politics for the Chinese people. After the Chinese people established their own country—the People's Republic of China—and stipulated their own founding charter—the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference—they have closely linked the fate of the country with their own vital interests. Convening People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society is a concrete step for the people to exercise their power to manage state power. At the same time, governments at all levels, by conscientiously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on convening People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society, have also begun to establish a new style of leadership, learning to arrange work, inspect work, and conduct criticism and self-criticism through the People's Representative Conferences; learning to concentrate the opinions of the people through the People's Representative Conferences and then adhere to them, transforming them into the common will and action of the masses of people from all walks of life. One of the reasons why we were able to successfully complete various tasks in 1949, despite our unfamiliarity with business, lack of cadres, and the intertwining of various complex tasks, was that we relied on the People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society.

The development of People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society convened in various places in 1949 was uneven. Generally speaking, there are two situations:

One situation is that the responsible comrades of the Party and government at all levels resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's and the Government Administration Council's instructions on conscientiously convening People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society. Generally, they held two meetings, some as many as ten or more. They have established the holding of People's Representative Conferences as a system. They made full preparations before the meeting, using symposiums, newspapers, blackboards, lectures, and other propaganda and mobilization methods to explain the specific tasks of the People's Representative Conference, deeply mobilizing, and extensively soliciting opinions from the masses. At the meeting, the responsible personnel of the government conscientiously reported on their work to the people's representatives, reported on financial revenue and expenditure, seriously reviewed the work situation, explained the location of errors and difficulties, and put forward active improvement methods. They spent most of their time listening to the opinions of the people, mobilizing representatives from all walks of life to inspect the extent to which the policies, laws, and resolutions of the Party and the People's Government were implemented, promoting criticism and self-criticism, allowing representatives to freely express their opinions on various issues, and engaging in debates on issues of principle in order to reach a consensus. The People's Representative Conference conscientiously discussed and made resolutions suitable to the needs of the people on the government's various work policies, such as restoring and developing production, suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, land reform, rent reduction and interest reduction, collecting public grain, and finance and finance. After the meeting, the representatives faithfully conveyed and explained the meeting resolutions to the people, promoting their implementation. The government also paid close attention to the implementation of the resolutions, thereby gaining the trust and support of the people. Sometimes the decisions of the meeting were implemented immediately. For example, the Beijing People's Representative Conference decided to close down brothels, and the Taiyuan People's Representative Conference decided to clear the streets, which were implemented very well, greatly increasing the confidence of the representatives and the masses of people in the meeting, believing that such meetings can really solve problems and demanding more meetings.

In these places, the People's Governments at all levels have established a solid prestige among the masses of the people due to the convening of People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society. The people's comments are: "The channels between the top and bottom are open!" This means that the government and the Party have established contact with the masses of the people. "The bottom line has been touched!" This means that the Party's land reform, financial and tax policies have been understood by people from all walks of life. The Party cadres said: "It won't work without democracy!" This means that not only outside the Party, but also inside the Party, has received a great education. This is the main aspect of the situation of the People's Representative Conferences in various places last year.

However, there is another situation in various places, which is the opposite of the above situation. That is, some comrades still have insufficient understanding of the role of the People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society, and therefore, there are still some areas where the leaders of the Communist Party and the People's Government have not actively started convening the People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society, and they have more or less some emotions of passive resistance. As of the end of December last year: Dozens of counties in the entire North China region have not yet been opened. Among the 140-odd counties in Shandong, more than 90 counties have been convened, and the remaining 50-odd counties have not been able to convene quickly (some counties have begun to convene in January, but still remain in the stage of "focusing on convening and gradually promoting"). In other areas, although such meetings were also convened, reports were also made at the meetings, and many resolutions were also passed, in reality, the problems were not solved. This is because many comrades are still accustomed to restricting their work to a small circle of a few cadres, only believing in cadre meetings, not believing in People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society, only accustomed to the past rural work methods, that is, conducting separate activities by cadres going down in a decentralized manner, handling some problems sporadically, and not understanding how to concentrate forces in a step-by-step and focused manner to solve a series of major problems, and therefore, they are not good at contacting the masses, organizing forces, and concentrating their use in the main aspects through the People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society. Taking production and disaster relief as an example: Some cadres are obsessed with the method of "visiting the suffering" from house to house, thinking that this is "going deep into the lower levels," and as a result, they have spent a lot of effort and time, but it is still a few people doing work, creating a situation of fighting alone. And it is easy to foster a mentality of dependence and a point of view of bestowing favors. This small-handed and small-footed method of disaster relief will never be able to universally mobilize and organize the masses to form a mass self-rescue movement on a large scale within a county or a district. In the work of collection, many places only know how to allocate collection figures through cadres, resulting in serious detachment from the masses of the people, causing unfair phenomena of being too heavy and too light. However, areas that have solved the problem of collection through the People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society have completed the task in a very short period of time. This shows that although the People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society is a basic method of contacting the masses of the people and promoting work, there are still many comrades who regard it as a consulting organ for collecting opinions from the masses, or only regard the opening of the People's Representative Conference as a "central task" to "make a surprise attack," creating a phenomenon of "opening the People's Representative Conference for the sake of opening the People's Representative Conference."

So, how can we successfully convene People's Representative Conferences for all sectors of society?

According to the main experience of this period, first of all, it is necessary to conduct extensive mobilization and education work among cadres, so that they thoroughly understand the solemn provisions of the Common Program that: "The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the People's Congresses at all levels and the People's Governments at all levels" and the provisions of the Organic Law of the People's Government of the People's Republic of China that: "The Government of the People's Republic of China is a government of the People's Congress system based on the principle of democratic centralism." It must be pointed out to them that the People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses at all levels are not "temporary" or "invitation-style" organs, but the most fundamental political system of New China, the basic way for the people to manage state power, and the organizational form for the people of the whole country to build the country. Anyone who expresses hesitation or even passive work on the basic principle of solving major problems in work through the People's Representative Conference will inevitably constitute an undisciplined act against the Common Program and the Party's policies, and will inevitably develop into an erroneous attitude towards workers and peasants that loses the principled stand, and a bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses. Experience in various places has proved that the senior Party committees and government organs of the Communist Party in various places must educate cadres conscientiously and repeatedly through every specific fact, resolutely fight against the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, and oppose all forms of closed-doorism and bureaucratic ideas and styles. It is necessary to establish a complete line of thought for the construction of a people's democratic regime among cadres at all levels, which is of great significance for successfully convening People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses for all sectors of society in 1950, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and further reforming and improving cadres and changing their style of work.

Secondly, the People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society must be conscientiously combined with the needs of the current practical work and the greatest demands of the people, which should be the starting point for determining the central content of all meetings. Before the meeting, it is necessary to conscientiously listen to the opinions of the people from all walks of life, investigate and study the most basic requirements and ideological trends of the masses, in order to determine the central issues to be discussed at the meeting, and at the meeting, it is necessary to be good at analyzing and studying the opinions of the masses, seeking proper solutions to the issues that the masses are most concerned about, and thereby making resolutions. By doing so, the meeting will have lively and active content, otherwise, it will inevitably commit the error of formalism. We should understand that in addition to bearing various obligations to the country at the People's Representative Conference, people from all walks of life also hope that the government will meet certain of their own political and economic demands. This is a manifestation of the political enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, which is a gratifying phenomenon. Governments at all levels must pay full attention to the demands of the masses and resolve them reasonably in accordance with correct principles. Today, the greatest demand of the masses is to better restore and develop production, and to demand a stable and democratic environment suitable for the development of production. However, some local governments only subjectively arrange some unrealistic things that are not relevant to the interests of the masses, or discuss some immediate tasks in a piecemeal manner, and fail to combine them with the long-term interests of the masses when convening the People's Representative Conference. Their mistake lies in not incorporating the production issues that people from all walks of life are concerned about into all their work. Experience in various places has proved that the People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society must spend a lot of time discussing the restoration and development of production. Generally and fundamentally speaking, production is the central task that overrides everything in any situation. Other tasks, such as suppressing bandits, fighting bullies, public grain, rent reduction, labor-capital relations, taxation, public bonds, land reform, cultural education, and municipal construction, although they are also important issues that must be resolved in certain periods and regions, can only be fundamentally resolved if they are carried out from the basic idea of developing production. In order to carry out this year's large-scale production movement, the provinces of North China and Northeast China have convened production meetings and formulated annual production plans. We suggest that all counties universally convene a People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society to arrange this year's spring plowing production work, and conscientiously solve all kinds of problems related to spring plowing production, such as solving various historical problems that hinder production, improving urban-rural relations, supplying seeds and fertilizers, and supporting households that have run out of food production problems. People's Representative Conferences in various places should conscientiously discuss and formulate production plans with specific content that are suitable to local conditions. When deploying production, counties should oppose simply passing a plan at the People's Representative Conference from top to bottom, that is, ordering the masses of the people to act accordingly. They must be good at grasping the minds of people from all walks of life, carefully analyze various opinions from the masses, help the masses calculate the accounts of production and life, and then concentrate them to formulate a practical plan, and adhere to this plan.

The People's Representative Conferences in various places must conscientiously follow the mass line, fully promote democracy, collect opinions from the masses in many ways, enrich and enliven the content of the meeting, and resolutely oppose all forms of formalism. The basic method is to let go of criticism and self-criticism. The People's Representative Conference for all sectors of society in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, consciously guided the masses to put forward their opinions, and found that the masses expressed great dissatisfaction with the unfair burden, and then corrected it, thereby solving the biggest problem that had been accumulated in the hearts of the masses for many years, and fundamentally improving the relationship between the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people in the county. In addition, some cadres like to list various work achievements at the People's Representative Conference, and hide the difficulties and shortcomings, thinking that this will make them look good. This phenomenon of reporting good news but not bad news is completely unacceptable and must be resolutely criticized. The People's Governments at all levels must make reports conscientiously and responsibly and in a down-to-earth manner at the People's Representative Conferences, and more importantly, listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, and must not fear criticism or suppress criticism. It is necessary to implement the principle of "say everything you know, say everything without reservation, the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take it as a warning," take the interests of the broad masses of the people as the starting point, adhere to the truth, and correct mistakes. Many of our cadres are only willing to review various mistakes at Party and government internal meetings, but are unwilling to make public self-criticism, fearing that this will lose their prestige. In fact, on the contrary, only by openly reviewing mistakes and placing work under the public supervision of the masses will it be convenient for us to unite closely with the people, thereby reducing the possibility of making mistakes. Only in this way can we establish unparalleled prestige among the masses of the people and continue to lead the people towards better unity and greater victory.

Regarding the form that should be adopted for opening the People's Representative Conference, we believe that there are two points worth mentioning to all places: The first is to cultivate a new democratic style, consciously help the representatives of the working people to fully express their opinions, and oppose the old democratic style. It looks like it is very democratic, but in fact it is a cumbersome and hypocritical form used to restrain the working people from expressing their opinions, and should not be adopted. We should and must hold meetings in an orderly manner, but we should adopt a truly honest and simple meeting method, and not be bound by the old democratic forms. Second, the People's Representative Conferences at all levels should not mechanically transport a fixed form. The People's Representative Conference of a large administrative region and the People's Representative Conference of a county or a village should implement a policy of adapting to local conditions in terms of content, procedures, and forms, and should not be forced to be the same. It is said that many county and district People's Representative Conferences imitate the meeting methods of the People's Political Consultative Conference, which is not appropriate. Generally speaking, the further down you go, the simpler the form should be, the simpler the content should be, the more specific the discussion of the issues should be, and should not be restricted by various unnecessary procedures or forms.

### 必须开好各界人民代表会议

　　必须开好各界人民代表会议
    一九四九年，全国大部地区，都先后召开了各界人民代表会议（或人民代表大会）；东北六省系统地召开了省县市的人民代表会议。华北、华东等地三万人口以上城市和一般城镇大部分都开了人民代表会议，山东、平原、察哈尔等省并召开了区村人民代表会议或人民代表大会，华东、华中南等地新区农村则普遍召开了农民代表会议。北京、天津、唐山等市召开的第二届各界人民代表会议已经代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了市人民政府。在全国人民实际政治生活中，一个巨大的民主浪潮掀起来了。经过这一良好的民主制度，人民正以主人翁的态度动员和组织起来，协助政府，为克服困难，完成胜利与巩固胜利而斗争。
    毫无疑问，这是一个重大的政治变革，标志着中国人民在民主政治的发展道路上向前飞跃的发展。中国人民在建立了自己的国家——中华人民共和国，规定了自己建国的大宪章——人民政协共同纲领之后，他们已经把国家命运同自己切身利益紧紧地连在一起，而召开各界人民代表会议，正是人民行使权力管理国家政权的具体步骤。同时，各级人民政府由于认真执行了毛主席关于召开各界人民代表会议的指示，也开始树立了新的领导作风，学会了经过人民代表会议布置工作，检查工作，进行批评与自我批评；学会了通过人民代表会议把人民的意见集中起来然后坚持下去，变为各阶层人民大众的共同意志和行动。一九四九年我们在业务不熟悉，干部缺少，各种复杂任务互相交错的条件下，得以顺利完成各项工作的原因之一，便是依靠了各界人民代表会议。
    一九四九年各地召开的各界人民代表会议，在发展上是不平衡的。一般地说，存在着两种情况：
    一种情况是，各级党政负责同志坚决贯彻了毛主席及政务院关于认真召开各界人民代表会议的指示，一般地都开了两次会，有的多至十次以上。他们已经把开人民代表会议定为制度。他们在会前进行了充分的准备，用座谈会、报纸、黑板报、讲演会等宣传鼓动方式解释人民代表会议的具体任务，深入动员，广泛征求群众意见。在会议上，政府负责人员认真地向人民代表报告工作，报告财政收支，对工作情况严肃地进行检讨，说明错误和困难之所在，并提出积极改进的办法，并以大部的时间来听取人民的意见，发动各界代表检查党和人民政府的政策法令和决议贯彻的程度，发扬批评和自我批评，让代表对各种问题自由发表意见，在原则问题上进行争论，以便求得一致的意见。对政府各项工作的方针，例如恢复与发展生产、剿匪、反恶霸、土地改革、减租减息、征收公粮及财政金融等问题，人民代表会议都认真讨论，作出适合人民需要的决议。在会后，代表们向人民群众忠实传达解释会议决议，促其贯彻实现。政府也十分注意贯彻执行决议，因而取得人民的信任与支持。有时会议的决定立即实施，例如北京各界人民代表会议决定封闭妓院，太原各界人民代表会议决定清除街道，就执行得很好，使代表们和人民群众对会议信心大大提高，认为这样的会真正能解决问题，要求多开。
    在这些地方，由于召开了各界人民代表会议，各级人民政府在人民群众中建立了巩固的威信。人民的评论是：“上下通气了！”这是说政府和党与人民群众建立了联系。“摸着底了！”这是说党的土地改革、财政税收等政策被各阶层的人民所了解。党的干部说：“不民主吃不开了！”这是说，不但党外，而且党内也受到了很大的教育。这是去年各地人民代表会议情况的主要的方面。
    但是，各地还存在着另外一种情况，即与上述相反的情况。就是，还有些同志对于各界人民代表会议的作用是认识不足，因而至今仍然有若干地区共产党和人民政府的领导者没有积极动手召开各界人民代表会议，他们或多或少地存在了一些消极抵抗的情绪。到去年十二月底为止：华北全区尚有几十个县未开。山东的一百四十余县当中，有九十多县已经召开，其余五十余县仍未能迅速召开（一月份有的县份已开始召开，但仍停留在“重点召开，逐渐推广”的阶段）。另外一些地区，虽然同样也召开了这种会议，也在会上作了报告，也通过了许多决议，实际上却是没有解决问题。这是因为有不少同志至今仍然习惯于把工作束缚在少数干部的狭小圈子内，只相信干部会议，不相信各界人民代表会议，只习惯于过去的农村工作方法，即通过干部分散下去进行单独活动，零散地处理一些问题，不懂得有步骤有重点地集中力量解决一系列的主要问题，因而也就不善于经过各界人民代表会议去联系群众，组织力量，集中使用在主要方面。就以生产救灾来说：有些干部迷恋于挨户“访苦”方式，以为这样是“深入下层”，结果是耗了很大力气，费了很多时间，仍是少数人做工作，造成孤军苦战的局面。且容易助长依赖心理与恩赐观点。这种小手小脚的救灾工作方法永远不可能在一个县一个区内普遍地动员组织群众形成群众性的大规模的自救运动。在征收工作上，很多地方只知道通过干部去分配征收数字，结果严重地脱离了人民群众，造成了畸重畸轻的不公现象。而通过各界人民代表会议来解决征收问题的地区，却在一个很短时期内便如数完成了。这就表示：虽然各界人民代表会议是联系人民群众，推动工作的基本方法，但至今仍有不少同志把它看做是搜集群众意见的谘询机关，或者只把开人民代表会议当作是“中心工作”来“突击”，造成了“为人民代表会议而开人民代表会议”的现象。
    那么，怎样才能开好各界人民代表会议呢？
    根据这一时期主要经验，首先必须广泛地在干部中进行动员和教育工作，要使他们彻底了解共同纲领所规定的：“中华人民共和国的国家政权属于人民。人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府”和中央人民政府组织法中所规定的：“中华人民共和国政府是基于民主集中原则的人民代表大会制的政府。”等庄严条文。必须向他们指出：各级人民代表会议或人民代表大会并不是什么“临时性的”，“请客式的”机关，而是新中国最根本的政权制度，是人民管理国家政权的基本方式，是全国人民建设国家的组织形式。任何人对于通过人民代表会议去解决工作中重大问题这一条基本原则表示动摇犹豫以至消极怠工，都必然会构成对共同纲领及党的政策的一种无组织无纪律行为，也必然会发展为错误地对待工人农民的丧失原则立场行为，和脱离群众的官僚主义作风。各地经验证明，共产党在各地的高级党委和政府机关必须通过每一具体事实，认真地反复地教育干部，坚决地同上述错误思想作斗争，反对一切形式的关门主义及官僚主义思想和作风。必须在各级干部中建立一个完整的人民民主政权建设的路线思想，这对于一九五○年开好各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会，巩固人民民主专政，并进一步改造和提高干部，转变作风，有很重要的意义。
    其次，各界人民代表会议必须认真与当前实际工作需要及人民最大的要求相结合，这应当是确定一切会议中心内容的出发点。会前必须认真倾听各界人民群众的意见，调查研究群众最基本要求和思想动态，以确定会议要讨论的中心问题，会上要善于分析研究群众意见，将群众最关心的问题求得妥善解决，并从而做出决议。这样做，会议便有了生动活泼的内容，否则就不可避免地犯形式主义的错误。我们应当了解，各阶层人民在人民代表会议上除了负担对国家的各种义务外，还希望政府满足自己一定的政治经济要求，这是各阶层人民政治积极性的表现，是可喜的现象。各级政府必须充分注意群众的要求并依据正确原则予以合理解决。今天群众最大的要求是更好地恢复与发展生产，要求有一个适合于发展生产的安定的民主的环境，可是，有些地方政府在召开人民代表会议时，却只是主观地布置一些不着边际的同群众利益不关痛痒的事情，或者枝枝节节地讨论一些眼前的工作，而未能与群众的长远利益相结合。他们的错误，在于没有把各阶层人民所关心的生产问题贯串在一切工作之中。各地经验证明：各界人民代表会议必须以很多的时间来讨论恢复与发展生产。一般的，也是基本的说来，生产在任何情况下都是压倒一切的中心任务。其他的工作，例如剿匪、反霸、公粮、减租、劳资关系、税收、公债、土改、文化教育、市政建设等，虽然在一定时期一定地区，也是必须解决的重要问题，但是，这些也只有从发展生产的基本思想出发来进行才能得到根本的解决。为了开展今年大生产运动，华北东北各省都召开了生产会议，制定了全年的生产计划。我们建议各县普遍召开一次各界人民代表会议布置今年春耕生产工作，认真解决一切与春耕生产有关的各种问题，如解决妨碍生产的各种历史遗留问题，改善城乡关系，供应种籽肥料以及扶助断炊户生产问题等。各地人民代表会议都应认真讨论，制定适合于当地情况的有具体内容的生产计划。各县在布置生产时，要反对自上而下地在人民代表会议上简单通过一纸计划，即命令人民群众照此行事，必须善于摸透各阶层人民的心思，仔细分析各种从群众中来的意见，帮助群众算生产和生活账，然后集中起来订出切合实际的计划，并把这个计划坚持下去。
    各地人民代表会议都必须认真走群众路线，充分发扬民主，多方地集中群众意见，使会议内容丰富生动而且有中心，坚决反对一切形式主义作风。基本的方法是放手开展批评与自我批评。山西定襄县各界人民代表会议由于领导机关有意识地引导群众提意见，发现群众对负担不公表示极大的不满，随即加以纠正，从而解决了多年来积压在群众心中的最大问题，使该县共产党、人民政府与人民的关系有了根本的改善。另外也有些干部喜欢在各界人民代表会议上罗列各种工作成绩，而把困难和缺点隐蔽起来，以为这样才显得漂亮。这种报喜不报忧的现象是完全要不得的，其结果必致说谎造假，必须予以坚决的批评。各级人民政府在各界人民代表会议上必须认真负责实事求是地作报告，更重要的是虚心听取群众意见，决不可惧怕批评或抑制批评。要实行“知无不言，言无不尽，言者无罪，闻者足戒”的原则，以广大人民利益为出发点，坚持真理，修正错误。我们有不少干部只愿意在党和政府内部会议上检讨各种错误，而不愿作公开的自我批评，害怕这样会丧失了自己的威信，其实恰恰相反，只有公开检讨错误，把工作放在群众公开监督之下，才便利于我们同人民的亲密团结，因而减少犯错误的可能。也只有如此，我们才能在人民群众中树立起无比的威信，继续领导人民走向更好的团结与更大的胜利。
    关于开人民代表会议应采取的形式，我们认为有两点值得提起各地注意：第一是必须培养新的民主作风，有意识地帮助劳动人民代表充分发表自己的意见，反对旧民主作风。它看起来好象很民主，实际上都是用来束缚劳动人民表示意见的繁琐的虚伪的形式，不应加以采用。我们应当而且必须有秩序地开会，但要采取真正老实朴素的开会方法，而不要为旧民主形式所束缚。第二，各级人民代表会议不可机械搬运一个固定形式。一个大行政区人民代表会议与一个县一个村的人民代表会议应当在内容、程序与形式上实行因地制宜的方针，不宜强求相同。据说有不少县区人民代表会议开会都来模仿人民政协的开会方法，这是不妥当的。一般地说，越是到了下级，形式应越简单，内容应越单一，问题的讨论越要具体，而不要受各种不必要的程序或形式所限制。
