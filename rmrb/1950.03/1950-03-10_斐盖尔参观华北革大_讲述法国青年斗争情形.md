　　Figères Visits North China Revolutionary University
　　Describes French Youth Struggle

　　[Reported by this newspaper] République des Jeunes de France (Republican Youth of France) Secretary-General, Leo Figères, representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, visited the North China People's Revolutionary University on the afternoon of March 7th. Figères discussed the teaching situation at the Revolutionary University with Principal Liu Lantao, Education Director Hou Weiyu, and other school officials, and attended a welcoming meeting held by representatives of the entire faculty and staff of the Revolutionary University.

　　Figères spoke at the meeting. He said: "The struggle of the French people and the French youth is directed towards the same goal as the struggle of the glorious Chinese people and the Chinese youth, although the methods of struggle may be somewhat different." He pointed out, "Like the Chinese youth, the French youth, led by the Soviet youth, unite under the banner of the World Federation of Youth, move towards a common goal, and struggle for lasting peace, people's democracy, national independence, and a better future for youth!" Then, after making a clear comparison between the democratic forces and the reactionary forces within France, he said: "The French people, with the exception of a very small number of reactionaries, are all opposed to a third world war. Even as I speak, more than a million metalworkers in France are on strike." "The French people's struggle for lasting peace has entered a new stage. In the past, it was just propaganda, but now it is taking practical action. This is the working class refusing to manufacture munitions and weapons, refusing to unload military supplies for American imperialism, and refusing to transport military supplies and troops to Vietnam. The task of French youth is to organize the youth of their own country and to help other democratic youth organizations in overseas countries to organize, refusing to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Moreover, they must call upon and organize youth in the army, in factories, and in colonial and semi-colonial countries not to participate in the war of aggression." Regarding this task, Figères said: "There are difficulties, but our struggle will surely succeed and will surely be victorious."

　　Figères' speech was warmly welcomed by all those present and was repeatedly interrupted by applause. After the speech, representatives of the entire school's Youth League members and the entire school's faculty and staff presented flowers to Mr. Figères, and both sides exchanged gifts.

　　斐盖尔参观华北革大
    讲述法国青年斗争情形
    【本报讯】世界民主青年联盟代表，法国共和国青年联盟总书记雷奥·斐盖尔，于三月七日下午参观华北人民革命大学。斐盖尔和革大刘澜涛校长、侯维煜教育长及其他学校负责同志座谈了革大教学情况，并出席了革大全体学工人员代表举行的欢迎大会。
    斐盖尔在会上讲话。他说：“法国人民、法国青年的斗争，和光荣的中国人民、中国青年的斗争是向着同一目标的，虽然斗争的方式可能有些不同。他指出“法国青年和中国青年一样，以苏联青年为首，团结在世界青年联盟的旗帜下，走向共同目标，为争取持久和平人民民主，民族独立和青年更好的将来而斗争！”接着他把法国内部民主力量与反动势力做了一个显明的对比后说：“法国人民除了极少数反动分子外，都反对第三次世界大战。就在我现在讲话的时候，法国百万以上的五金工人，正在罢工。”“法国人民为争取持久和平的斗争，已进入新的阶段，过去只是宣传，现在则是实际行动起来了。这就是工人阶级拒绝制造军火武器，拒绝为美帝卸运军火，拒绝运送军火、军队到越南去。法国青年的任务，就是组织本国青年，并帮助其他海外国家的民主青年组织起来，拒绝参加侵略越南的战争。而且要在军队中，工厂中，及殖民地、半殖民地的国家中，号召并组织青年不参加侵略战争。”对于这样的任务，斐盖尔说：“是有困难的，但我们的斗争一定能成功，一定会胜利。”
    斐盖尔的讲话，受到全体到会人员的热烈欢迎，屡为掌声所断。讲话后，革大全校青年团员、全校学工人员代表向斐盖尔先生献花，双方并互赠礼物。
