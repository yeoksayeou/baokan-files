　　Snippets from the Soviet Elections
    Laboring people in thirty-odd squares in Moscow celebrated with joyous singing and dancing
    Voters on trains stayed awake awaiting the 6 a.m. voting hour
    Red flags fluttered in the March breeze in Moscow. By noon on the 12th, voters had completed their voting. In the evening, voters gathered in thirty-odd squares in Moscow to celebrate joyously. Music was everywhere, and the squares were decorated with lights reading "Glory to Stalin." Famous actors and artistic troupes performed programs on the squares. Light snowflakes danced in the brilliant lights, and the celebrating laboring people sang and danced until late at night.
    Celebration meetings were held in urban and rural clubs in the Moscow region, with more than three thousand amateur artistic groups participating in performances.
    In Riga, the capital of Latvia, the famous turner Gobinsch showed young voters a yellowed scrapbook of old newspaper clippings with his past job-seeking advertisements from the capitalist era. Gobinsch told the young people that those advertisements did not help him find a job, because doctors were working as nurses and engineers were working as agricultural laborers. He said: We have no unemployment in the Soviet Union; I vote to support our own government.
    Polling stations were set up in sanatoriums, rest homes, hotels, long-distance trains, and ships. On trains, voters stayed awake awaiting the 6 a.m. voting hour.
    In the Chukotka National District's Ugolnaya Bay, snowstorms raged from the 11th, but voting proceeded enthusiastically. Within the first hour, one-third of the voters had already cast their ballots.
    The 102nd electoral district in Vladivostok was located on the whaling flagship Aleut, anchored in Golden Horn Bay. Whale hunters received government awards on election day. Under the leadership of Captain Polyakov, the ship's whale catch and oil production nearly doubled in the post-war years.
    In the Chukchi reindeer herder and hunter settlements in the northeasternmost corner of the Soviet Union, and at the Arctic stations in the eastern Arctic region, polling stations were open to voters. When Moscow's evening glow was splendid on the 11th, they had already begun a new day—the 12th. The Lykarima electoral district was bustling at 4 a.m., and by 7:30 a.m., 80 percent of all voters had cast their ballots.
    In the city of Irkutsk in Eastern Siberia, election day felt like a holiday. Collective farmers rode cars to polling places to vote. At 2 p.m., hunters from the Katanga pine forest zone arrived at the polling places with their rich game.

　　苏联选举花絮
    莫斯科三十几个广场劳动人民狂欢歌舞庆祝
    火车上的选民醒着等候早上六点钟的投票时刻
    莫斯科的红旗飘荡在三月的微风里。十二日正午时分，选民已投票完毕。晚间选民们都来到莫斯科的三十几个广场上欢腾庆祝。到处是音乐，到处装饰着“光荣归于斯大林”的灯光。广场上有著名的演员和艺术团体的节目演出。轻盈的雪花在灿烂的灯光中飞舞，狂欢的劳动人民歌唱、舞蹈，直到深夜。
    莫斯科州城乡俱乐部都举行庆祝会，有三千个以上的业余艺术团体参加表演。
    拉脱维亚首都里加的著名旋工哥宾施在选举时给青年选民看一本年代久远纸色变黄的剪报簿，上面贴着他以前在资本主义时代的报纸上刊登的寻求职业的广告。哥宾施给青年们讲说那些广告并没有帮他找到职业，因为那时医生也在当护士，工程师在作农业劳工。他说：我们苏联没有失业，我投票拥护我们自己的政府。
    休养所、疗养院、旅馆、长途火车和航船上都设有选举处。在火车上，选民都醒着等候早上六点钟的投票时刻。
    朱科茨克民族区乌戈尔纳雅湾从十一日就风雪交加，但投票仍热烈进行。在头一小时内，就有三分之一的选民投了票。
    海参崴的第一○二选区设在停泊在金角湾的捕鲸旗舰阿留特号船上。捕鲸工人在选举日适逢政府颁授勋章。在船长波尔亚科夫的领导下，在战后数年中，该船捕鲸量和产油量增加了将近一倍。
    在苏联最东北角的朱克察驯鹿饲养人和猎人住区，北极东部地区的北极站等处，投票处为选民开放着。当十一日莫斯科晚霞灿烂时分，他们已开始新的一天——十二日了。莱卡里马选区在上午四时就熙熙攘攘，到七时三十分，已有全体选民的百分之八十投了票。
    东部西伯利亚的伊尔库次克城，选举日好像过节。集体农民坐车到投票处投票。下午二时，卡坦加松林地带的猎人，带着丰富的猎获物到投票处投票。
