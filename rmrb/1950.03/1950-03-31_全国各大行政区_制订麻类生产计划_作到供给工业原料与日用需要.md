　　Major Administrative Regions Across the Country
    Develop Ramie Production Plans
    To Supply Industrial Raw Materials and Daily Needs
    [This newspaper reports] In February, most administrative regions and provinces across the country successively formulated ramie production plans for 1950, and some even held special meetings to make arrangements. The plans of various regions are described as follows:
    Northeast Region: Based on the seeds produced in various regions in 1949, and ordering 2.4 million catties of seeds, kenaf will be promoted in Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Jilin provinces, with rewards for planting 525,000 mu, which can produce 31.84 million catties of fiber. Planting 360,000 mu of green ramie can produce 29.4 million catties of fiber. The total amount of the two types can meet the minimum needs of the burlap bag factories. In addition to last year's seeds, 2.54 million catties of flax seeds were ordered and cultivated on 570,000 mu in Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces, which can produce 83.6 million catties of fiber for flax textile mills. Hemp (line hemp) is cultivated on 300,000 mu in Jilin, which can produce 16 million catties of fiber for paper making. Other regions plan according to local needs.
    North China Region: To meet the raw material needs of burlap bag factories in the North China Region, 300,000 mu of green ramie (莔麻) will be cultivated in Hebei Province, which can produce 24 million catties of fiber. 142,000 mu will be cultivated in Pingyuan Province, which can produce 11.3 million catties of fiber, for a total of 35.3 million catties of fiber. To solve the local need for daily-use hemp, Shanxi plans to plant 255,000 mu of hemp, which can produce 19.025 million catties of fiber. Suiyuan will plant 19,000 mu of hemp, which can produce 950,000 catties of fiber.
    Northwest Region: Shaanxi and Ningxia provinces will plant 2,416 mu of green ramie to supply the daily needs of local people, which can produce 145,000 catties of fiber; 18,483 mu of hemp, which can produce 3,592,600 catties of fiber; and 1,673 mu of ramie, which can produce 100,000 catties of fiber.
    East China Region: Shandong Province will plant 40,000 mu of kenaf in the Jiaodong area, which can produce 8 million catties of fiber. Zhejiang Province will plant 150,000 mu of jute, which, together with the small amount of jute in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Fujian provinces, can produce 63.64 million catties of fiber. Anhui can produce 8 million catties of green ramie, which is sufficient for the local burlap bag industry. In addition, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces will produce 37.487 million catties of hemp, and Anhui Province will produce 7.36 million catties of ramie, to meet the daily needs of the people.
    The Central South and Southwest regions are all planning according to the needs of each province. Currently, all regions are actively preparing seeds to complete this year's production increase plan.

　　全国各大行政区
    制订麻类生产计划
    作到供给工业原料与日用需要
    【本报讯】二月份内，全国多数行政区及省均先后制定了一九五○年麻类生产计划，有的并召开专门会议进行了布置。现将各地计划分述如下：
    东北区：洋麻以一九四九年各地生产种籽为基础，并订购种籽二百四十万斤，在辽东、辽西、吉林三省奖励推广种植五十二万五千亩，可产纤维三千一百八十四万斤；青麻植三十六万亩，可产纤维二千九百四十万斤，两种总计可供麻袋厂最低需要。亚麻除去年种籽外，订购种籽二百五十四万斤，在吉林、松江、黑龙江三省栽培五十七万亩，可产纤维八千三百六十万斤，以供亚麻纺织厂原料。大麻（线麻），在吉林栽培三十万亩，可产纤维一千六百万斤，供造纸原料。其他各地根据当地需要自行计划。
    华北区：为配合华北区各麻袋厂原料需要，在河北省栽培青麻（莔麻）三十万亩，可产纤维二千四百万斤；平原省栽培十四万二千亩，可产纤维一千一百三十万斤，共计可产纤维三千五百三十万斤。为解决当地日用麻之需要，山西计划种大麻二十五万五千亩，可产纤维一千九百另二万五千斤；绥远种大麻一万九千亩，可产纤维九十五万斤。
    西北区：陕西、宁夏二省供给当地群众日用之需要，种植青麻二千四百十六亩，可产纤维十四万五千斤；大麻一万八千四百八十三亩，可产纤维三百五十九万二千六百斤；苎麻一千六百七十三亩，可产纤维十万斤。
    华东区：山东省在胶东一带种植洋麻四万亩，可产纤维八百万斤，浙江省种植黄麻十五万亩，连同安徽、江苏、福建等省之少量黄麻，共可产纤维六千三百六十四万斤，安徽可产青麻八百万斤，足可供当地麻袋工业之用。其他浙江、安徽二省生产大麻三千七百四十八万七千斤，安徽省生产苎麻七百三十六万斤，供群众日用之需要。
    中南区、西南区都由各省根据需要计划中。现在各地都在积极准备种籽，以完成今年之增产计划。
