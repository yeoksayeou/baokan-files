	New Victory for Socialist Economy
	The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party on further reducing state retail prices for food and manufactured goods marks a further improvement in the lives of the Soviet people and the superiority of the socialist economy.
	This is the third price reduction in Soviet state-owned retail businesses since 1947. The Soviet people have gained even greater benefits than in the previous two instances. The first price reduction in December 1947 saved the Soviet people nearly 86 billion rubles, and the second price reduction in March 1949 saved nearly 71 billion rubles. The latest price reduction will result in the Soviet people gaining no less than 110 billion rubles. At the same time, due to the substantial increase in the actual income of workers and peasants, the substantial increase in the purchasing power of the ruble, and the devaluation and inflation occurring in capitalist countries, it has become not only entirely possible but also entirely necessary to increase the ruble's exchange rate with foreign currencies and adopt more stable gold standard measures. The ruble has now become the most reliable and stable currency in the world.
	The Soviet government and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party were able to make this significant decision based on the new achievements of Soviet industry and agriculture in 1949, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs. In 1949, the total output of Soviet industry increased by 20% compared to 1948, and by 41% compared to the pre-war year of 1940. According to the Five-Year Plan, the total output of Soviet industry in 1950 should exceed 48% of the pre-war 1940 production, but in the fourth quarter of 1949, the average monthly total industrial output had already exceeded 53% of the 1940 level. The total agricultural output in 1949 also exceeded the pre-war 1940 level. This provided the material conditions for a further increase in the welfare of the Soviet people.
	The situation in the capitalist world is completely opposite. Most notably, the people of capitalist countries are becoming increasingly impoverished. More than 57% of American families do not have enough income to maintain a minimum standard of living. The purchasing power of the French people decreased by 20% in the year before September 1949. The wholesale price of goods in Britain has increased by 118% compared to pre-war levels, and retail prices have increased by 12% in the year before September 1949, while the increase in workers' wages has lagged far behind. The actual wages of West German workers are less than 60% of pre-war levels, the cost of living in Belgium rose by 20% in 1949, the Netherlands by 15%, and the Scandinavian countries by 50% compared to pre-war levels.
	The brilliant achievements of the socialist economy increasingly and powerfully prove the complete decay of the capitalist system and its inevitable final demise, and increasingly and powerfully encourage people all over the world to strive for a happy and fulfilling life.
		
	The Soviet People Enthusiastically Conduct Election Campaigns
	In a few days—March 12th—the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union will hold elections for the highest organ of state power in the socialist country—the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union—amidst the epoch-making victories of socialism. The election campaign has now entered a new stage, namely the stage of conducting election propaganda for candidates of the Party and the non-Party bloc.
	Since the beginning of the election campaign, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and public organizations have printed a large number of documents, slogans, and political reading materials for the election, distributed them to thousands upon thousands of residential areas, and established election propaganda stations in urban and rural electoral districts, enabling millions of male and female laborers to increasingly and profoundly understand the Stalin Constitution and election regulations, the overall picture of the Party and government's policies, and the international situation in which the socialist camp is expanding and the capitalist camp is shrinking. At the same time, across the vast Soviet land, in Moscow and Leningrad, in the cities and villages of the Far East and Siberia, in Ukraine and Belarus, in the Baltic republics and Central Asia, the Soviet people—workers, peasants, and intellectuals—enthusiastically organized and participated in every preparatory work in the election campaign. They nominated candidates for the Central Election Commission responsible for presiding over election matters at mass rallies, they nominated representative candidates of the Party and non-Party bloc at preliminary election meetings, they held gatherings for these candidates to meet all voters, and called for a harmonious and unified election of their common candidates. In all factories, institutions, collective farms, and every production department, a surge of production ahead of schedule has been launched, and working people are welcoming the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union with a new upsurge in socialist competition and with the collective labor achievements of creating a great socialist country's welfare.
	The entire election campaign has become a political school for millions of male and female laborers in the Soviet Union. From this election campaign, they have further recognized the greatness of the Stalin Constitution and election regulations, and further experienced the superiority of the Soviet socialist democratic system. The All-Union Communist Party's proclamation to voters calling on all voters to vote for candidates of the Party and non-Party bloc proves with irrefutable facts the achievements of the Soviet state in all aspects and its strength and invincibility. This is a document of particular political importance and great inspirational power for the Soviet people marching towards communism, for the people of people's democratic countries marching towards socialism, for the Chinese people building new democracy, and for the people all over the world who love peace, democracy, and freedom.
		
	After the British Election
	The results of the British general election foreshadow a growing political crisis in Britain, a more reactionary domestic and foreign policy, and a new attack on the living standards of the working people.
	For four and a half years, the reactionary nature and deceptiveness of the Labor Party have been greatly exposed to the British people because the right-wing Labor Party leaders abandoned the promises they made in the first general election after the war and implemented the policies of the Conservative Party, which is controlled by monopoly capitalists. In this election, if most of the working-class voters who opposed conservatism had not concentrated their votes on the Labor Party in order to resist the Conservative Party's attempt to restore power, the Labor Party would inevitably have suffered a greater defeat, certainly not just losing more than seventy seats.
	The result of the election has caused a major change in the situation in the British Parliament. The Labor Party holds only a slight majority in Parliament—only nineteen seats more than the Conservative Party, and only two votes more than half of Parliament, while the Conservative Party has grasped more effective weapons to control the Labor Party bureaucracy than in the past (the Conservative Party has 296 seats, the Liberal Party, which supports the Conservative Party, has 9 seats, and the Irish Nationalist Party has 2 seats, totaling 307 seats, while the Labor Party has only 315 seats). This makes it impossible for the new government formed by the Labor Party bureaucracy to maintain its stability. The Conservative Party can take advantage of the absence of a minority of Labor Party members at any time to obstruct the passage of bills or demand a vote of confidence, forcing the Labor Party government to collapse.
	Confronting Attlee, Bevin, and Cripps are: first, an immediate re-election; second, forming a mixed cabinet with the Conservative Party to share the spoils; and third, under the form of a separate government, serving the interests of American imperialism and British big capital more docilely in order to extend its life as much as possible. Obviously, neither the Labor Party nor the Conservative Party is willing to adopt the first method at present, because neither side has the confidence to gain an advantage in another election. They prefer to cooperate against the interests of the British people in the second or third way. Therefore, it can be predicted that in the coming months, Attlee and Churchill will launch a more vicious joint offensive against the British people, especially the British working class. For example: the reactionary parliament will pass an aggressive huge military budget to comply with the war policy of American imperialism; it will no longer implement new "nationalization" bills that decorate the facade of "socialism"; it will greatly reduce social welfare programs; and it will continue to freeze wages. This means that Britain will further move towards war and inevitably lead to an economic crisis, which will further impoverish the lives of the British working people.
	The new British Parliament has become a uniformly reactionary parliament, with no Communist Party members or progressive members who truly represent the interests of the working class, and it is impossible to hear militant voices in Parliament anymore. Precisely for this reason, all progressive forces in Britain, led by the Communist Party, will launch an increasingly broad and intense struggle outside the reactionary parliament, deepening this struggle into factories, workers' organizations, and the general masses. It can be believed that accompanying the economic crisis deepened by the reactionary rule of the Labor Party and the Conservative Party will be the increasing growth of the British political crisis.
		
	Budgets of Eastern European People's Democratic Countries
	The Eastern European People's Democratic Countries have entered the road of socialist construction. Their superiority in economic systems, new victories in economic production, and unwavering adherence to a policy of peace are vividly reflected in the budget figures for 1950.
	Taking Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania as examples: Poland's total budget for this year increased by 35% compared to last year, Bulgaria increased by 33%, and Romania's total income exceeded its total expenditure by 3 billion lei (Romanian currency). The increase in budget revenue mainly comes from the comprehensive development of industrial and agricultural productivity and from the huge profits earned by the socialist nationalized economic sector. This year, the income of Poland's state-owned economic sector accounts for 75% of the total budget revenue, while in Romania it accounts for four-fifths. This is completely contrary to the situation in capitalist countries, where they raise income taxes on wages and salaries to make up for budget deficits, shifting the burden onto the working people.
	In terms of expenditures, 43.5% of Poland's budget is used for developing the national economy, 32.6% for culture, education, science, health, and social insurance, of which education accounts for 23.6%; 35% of Bulgaria's budget is used for developing the national economy, 30% for social and cultural undertakings, and 8% for social insurance. Poland's defense and state security expenses account for only 10.2%, and Bulgaria's for only 7%. All expenses of Romanian state organs are only one-third of those during the capitalist rule, and the vast majority of the total budget is used for capital investment, education, and health undertakings.
	In Western European capitalist countries, the situation of budget expenditures is exactly the opposite, with military expenditures accounting for the largest proportion: last year, Britain's direct military spending accounted for 23% of the total expenditure, France for 18.7%, Italy for 23.6%, and the Netherlands for 30%, and indirect military spending is not included, and it is estimated that this year's military expenses will account for a larger proportion.
	The budgets of the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries this year, in terms of their direction and structure, are already budgets of a socialist nature—the vast majority of the income comes from the socialist nationalized economic sector, and the vast majority of the expenditures are used for the national economy, cultural construction, and social insurance undertakings. This stands in stark contrast to the exploitative and aggressive budgets of capitalist countries.

    社会主义经济的新胜利
    苏联部长会议与联共中央委员会关于再次减低食品及制成品国家零售价格的决定，标志着苏联人民生活的进一步提高，标志着社会主义经济优越性。
    这是一九四七年以来苏联国营零售事业中的第三次减价。苏联人民比过去两次获得了更大的利益。一九四七年十二月实行的第一次减价，使苏联人民节省了将近八百六十亿卢布，一九四九年三月实行的第二次减价，节省了将近七百一十亿卢布。而这一次减价的结果，则使苏联人民获得不下于一千一百亿卢布的利益。同时，由于工农实际收入的大大增加，由于卢布购买力的大大提高，更由于资本主义国家正在发生着货币跌价和通货膨胀的事情，因此提高卢布与外币的兑换率，并改用更稳定的金本位的措施，不仅成为完全可能，而且也完全必要。卢布现在已经成为世界上最可靠和最稳定的货币。
    苏联政府和联共中央所以能够作出这个重大决定，乃是以一九四九年苏联工农业的新成就，劳动生产率的提高和生产成本的减低为基础。一九四九年，苏联工业总产量较一九四八年增加百分之二○，较战前一九四○年增加百分之四一。按照五年计划的规定，一九五○年苏联全部工业总产量应超过战前一九四○年生产的百分之四八，而在一九四九年的第四季，每月平均的工业总产量就已超过了一九四○年水平的百分之五三。一九四九年的农业总产量，也已超过了战前一九四○年的水平。这就提供了苏联人民福利进一步增涨的物质条件。
    资本主义世界的情形，则一切都与此相反。最显著的，是资本主义各国人民生活的日益贫困化。百分之五十七以上的美国家庭收入，不能维持最低限度的生活。法国人民的购买力，在一九四九年九月以前的一年间，减低了百分之二○。英国的批发物价比战前涨百分之一一八，零售物价在一九四九年九月以前的一年间涨百分之一二，而工人工资的增加则远远落在后面。西德工人的实际工资不及战前的百分之六○，比利时的生活费用一九四九年涨百分之二○，荷兰涨百分之一五，斯堪的纳维亚国家则比战前涨百分之五○。
    社会主义经济的辉煌成就，愈来愈有力量地证明资本主义制度的彻底腐朽及其不可挽救的最后灭亡的命运，愈来愈有力量地鼓励着全世界人类为争取幸福美满的生活而向前努力。
            苏联人民热烈进行选举运动
    再过几天——三月十二日，苏联各族人民将在社会主义的划时代胜利中，举行社会主义国家的最高权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃的选举。选举运动现已进入新阶段，即为党与非党联盟的候选人作选举宣传的阶段。
    自从选举运动开始以来，苏联共产党、苏联政府和公众团体，为选举印行了大量的文件、标语和政治读物，分送到千千万万的居民区，并在各城乡选区设立了选举宣传站，使千百万男女劳动者日益深刻地了解斯大林宪法和选举条例，了解党和政府政策的全貌，了解社会主义阵营日益扩大和资本主义阵营日益缩小的国际形势。同时，在广阔的苏维埃国土上，在莫斯科和列宁格勒，在远东和西伯利亚的城市和乡村，在乌克兰和白俄罗斯，在波罗的海各共和国和中亚细亚，苏联人民——工人、农民和知识分子，热烈地组织和参加了选举运动中的每一项准备工作。他们在群众大会上提出主持选举事宜的中央选举委员会候选人，他们在预选大会上提出党与非党联盟的代表候选人，他们为这些候选人举行集会，使与全体选民见面，并号召融洽一致地选举他们的共同候选人。在各工厂、各机关、各集体农场，在每一个生产部门，都掀起了提前完成定额的生产热潮，劳动人民正以社会主义竞赛的新高涨，以创造伟大社会主义国家福利的集体劳动业迹，来迎接苏联最高苏维埃的选举。
    整个选举运动已成为苏联千百万男女劳动者的政治学校。他们从这一次选举运动中进一步认识了斯大林宪法和选举条例的伟大，进一步体验了苏维埃社会主义民主制度的优越性。联共中央为号召全体选民投票选举党与非党联盟候选人而发布的告选民书，以无可辩驳的事实证明了苏维埃国家在各方面的成就及其强盛而不可被战胜。这对于走向共产主义的苏联人民，对于走向社会主义的人民民主国家人民，对于建设新民主主义的中国人民，以及对于爱好和平、民主与自由的全世界人民，尤其是一个具有政治重要性和具有极大鼓舞力量的文件。
            英国选举以后
    英国这次大选的结果，预示英国的政治危机将日益增长，内外政策将更趋反动，劳动人民的生活水平将受到新的进攻。
    四年半以来，由于右翼工党领袖们背弃了自己在战后第一次大选中所作的诺言，而执行了为垄断资本家所操纵的保守党的政策，工党的反动本质和欺骗性，已大大暴露于英国人民的面前。在这次选举中，反对保守主义的大部分工人选民，如果不是为了抵制保守党的复辟企图，而把选票集中于工党的话，则工党势必遭受更大的挫败，决不止仅仅丧失七十多个议席。
    选举的结果已使英国议会的情况起了重大的变化。工党在议会中只占微弱的多数——比保守党只多十九个议席，比议会的过半数只多两票，而保守党则已掌握了比过去更有效的控制工党官僚的武器（保守党二九六席，支持保守党的自由党九席，爱尔兰国民党两席，共占三○七席，工党仅三一五席）。这就使得由工党官僚所组成的新政府，不能保持其稳定性。保守党随时可以利用工党议员中少数人的缺席，阻碍议案的通过，或要求举行信任投票，迫使工党政府垮台。
    摆在艾德礼、贝文、克利浦斯面前的：一是立即重行选举；二是与保守党组织混合的分赃内阁，三是在单独组织政府的形式下，更驯服地为美帝国主义和英国大资本的利益服务，以期尽可能延长其生命。很明显，不论工党也好，保守党也好，目前还不愿采取第一种办法，因为双方都没有在另一次选举中获取优势的信心。他们宁愿在第二种或第三种方式下，实行反对英国人民利益的合作。因此，可以预料，在今后几个月内，艾德礼和邱吉尔将对英国人民特别是英国的工人阶级发动更凶恶的联合攻势。例如：反动议会将通过侵略性的庞大军事预算，以服从于美帝国主义的战争政策；将不再实行装饰“社会主义”门面的“国有化”新法案；将大大削减社会福利事业；将继续冻结工资。这就是说，将使英国进一步走向战争和不可免地招致经济危机，将使英国劳动人民的生活进一步贫困化。
    英国的新议会已成为清一色的反动议会，已经没有真正代表工人阶级利益的共产党议员和进步议员，在议会中不可能再听到富于战斗性的呼声。正因为这个缘故，以共产党为领导的英国一切进步力量，将在反动议会之外，展开日益广泛和剧烈的斗争，使这一斗争深入工厂、工人组织和一般群众。可以相信，伴随着工党、保守党反动统治所加深着的经济危机而来的，将是英国政治危机的日益增长。
            东欧人民民主国家的预算
    东欧人民民主国家已进入社会主义建设的道路。它们在经济制度上的优越性，在经济生产上的新胜利以及坚持不渝的和平政策，从一九五○年的预算数字上，生动地体现出来。
    试以波兰、保加利亚和罗马尼亚三国为例：本年度波兰的预算总额，比去年度增加了百分之三五，保加利亚增加了百分之三三，而罗马尼亚的总收入则比总支出超过三十亿列伊（罗币）。预算收入增加的来源，主要是由于工农生产力的全面发展，由于社会主义化的国营经济部分所获得的巨额利润。本年度波兰国营经济部分的收入，占预算总收入的百分之七五，罗马尼亚则为五分之四。这与资本主义国家为弥补预算赤字，而提高对工资和薪水的所得税，把负担转嫁到劳动人民身上的情形，完全相反。
    在支出方面，波兰的百分之四三·五用于发展国民经济，百分之三二·六用于文教、科学、卫生和社会保险，其中教育占百分之二三·六；保加利亚百分之三五用于发展国民经济，百分之三○用于社会文化事业，百分之八用于社会保险事业。波兰的国防费和国家治安费仅占百分之一○·二，保加利亚仅占百分之七。罗马尼亚国家机关的全部支出，仅及资本主义统治时期的三分之一，预算总额中的绝大部分，用于资产投资、教育和卫生事业。
    在西欧资本主义国家，预算支出的情形恰恰相反，军事费用占了最大部分：去年度，英国的直接军费占总支出的百分之二三，法国占百分之一八·七，意大利占百分之二三·六，荷兰占百分之三○，而间接军费还不计算在内，估计本年度的军事费用将占更大的比例。
    东欧人民民主国家本年度的预算，就其方向和结构来说，已经是属于社会主义性质的预算——收入的绝大部分来自社会主义化的国营经济部分，支出的绝大部分用于国民经济、文化建设和社会保险事业。这与资本主义国家剥削性的和侵略性的预算相比，形成鲜明的对照。
