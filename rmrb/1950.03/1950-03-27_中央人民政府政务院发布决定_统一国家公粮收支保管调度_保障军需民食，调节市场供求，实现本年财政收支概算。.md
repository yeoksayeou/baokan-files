　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Central People's Government Administration Council recently issued a decision on unifying the national public grain revenue, expenditure, storage, and dispatch (passed at the 25th Administration Council meeting on March 24, 1950), the full text of which is as follows:

　　In order to improve and unify the national public grain revenue, expenditure, storage, and dispatch system, to ensure military and civilian food needs, regulate grain market supply and demand, and achieve the 1950 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget, the following decisions are made:

  I. Public Grain Revenue and Expenditure:

    1.  The tax rules and tax rates for levying national public grain shall be uniformly stipulated by the Central People's Government Administration Council, and local people's governments at all levels shall not independently determine or modify them. The allocation of national public grain collection tasks shall be decided by the Central People's Government Administration Council based on the actual conditions of various regions. Local people's governments at all levels must strictly abide by the tax rules, tax rates, and grain collection policies stipulated by the Central Government, conduct collection cautiously and correctly, and complete the tasks. For those exceeding the public grain tasks assigned by the Central Government, and not violating the grain collection policies and laws stipulated by the Central Government, 20% of the excess amount will be submitted to the Central Government, and 80% will remain with the local government. The proportion of local public grain additionally collected by each county shall not exceed 15% of the regular grain, and shall be reported to the provincial people's government for review and forwarded to the Greater Administrative Region People's Government for approval. The provincial people's governments and commissioner's offices may also appropriately dispatch and adjust local public grain according to the specific financial situation of the counties under their jurisdiction.

    2.  Implement a strict public grain warehousing system: National public grain shall be stored in the central public grain depot; county local grain shall be stored in the county public grain depot. To strengthen the management of national public grain, the Central Government establishes a State Grain Administration, under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. Greater Administrative Regions establish Grain Bureaus, under the dual leadership of the Central Grain Administration and the Greater Administrative Region Finance Department. Provinces establish Provincial Grain Bureaus, under the dual leadership of the Greater Administrative Region Grain Administration and the Provincial Finance Department; provinces directly under the Central Government are under the dual leadership of the Central Grain Administration and the Provincial Finance Department. Special districts may establish Grain Sub-bureaus and Central Public Grain District Depots, and counties may establish Central Public Grain Sub-depots, all under the dual leadership of the higher-level Grain Bureau/Depot and the corresponding level government. The main responsibilities of grain bureaus and central public grain depots at all levels are to manage national public grain. Other work related to agricultural tax investigation, land assessment, and public grain collection shall be executed by the finance departments at all levels under the leadership of the people's governments at all levels, to ensure specialized responsibility. The organizational regulations and division of powers will be determined separately.

    3.  Strictly implement the public grain payment system: Public grain stored in warehouses, except for county local public grain and individual special areas authorized by the Central Government, shall be allocated uniformly by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. No other agency or individual shall use it without authorization, and violators shall be given due punishment.

    4.  Define the scope of use of national public grain: Except for grain allocated to offset expenses, other expenditures that can be paid in currency or in-kind shall not use national public grain. National public grain expenditures are limited to the food grain for troops and government agencies and organizations above the district level, the food grain for public-funded teachers and students in public schools, disaster relief grain, preferential treatment grain, infant care grain, food grain for participating civil laborers, and some river management grain; the remainder should be allocated to trade grain as a priority to regulate people's food supply and withdraw currency.

    5.  People's governments and the People's Liberation Army at all levels shall, in accordance with the actual number of people within the prescribed establishment, respectively prepare annual and quarterly grain demand budget tables, which shall be reviewed and summarized level by level and reported. The government system shall be verified and allocated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government; the military system shall be summarized by the General Logistics Department of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission and reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for verification and allocation. After the grain budget required by major administrative regions and centrally administered provinces (municipalities) is approved, it shall be allocated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government once a year or in two installments.

    6.  National public grain expenditures shall uniformly use three-part allocation orders, gradually abolishing the grain coupon system. The national public grain allocation order shall be signed and issued by the Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government. Within the approved amount of public grain to be received and allocated, the Minister of Finance of the Greater Administrative Region or the Director of the Finance Department (Bureau) of the centrally administered province (municipality) may sign and issue it. The county local public grain allocation order shall be signed and issued by the county magistrate.

    7.  Grain Bureaus and Central Public Grain Depots at all levels must establish a periodic public grain revenue and expenditure reporting system and a monthly public grain revenue and expenditure statement system. If monthly statements are difficult, a periodic reporting system on public grain revenue and expenditure shall be implemented so that the Central Government can grasp the national public grain revenue and expenditure situation and ensure that inventory and book records are consistent.

  II. Public Grain Storage:

    1.  Grain depot construction shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:

    Plan to construct grain warehouses and processing factories within three to four years. The construction plan for county local public grain depots shall be formulated by the county people's government, reported to the provincial people's government for approval, and gradually constructed from 1951 onwards. For central public grain depots and processing factories, those whose grain preservation and processing belong to the financial supply needs are financial grain depots, and the construction plan shall be formulated by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government or entrusted to the Finance Department of the Greater Administrative Region; those whose grain preservation and processing belong to the needs of the trade department to regulate market supply and demand and cannot be combined with financial grain depots may build separate trade grain depots, and the construction plan shall be formulated by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. The construction plans for the above two types of central public grain depots and processing factories shall be prepared or constructed only after being reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council for approval.

    The location of the depots, trade grain depots and financial grain depots, should be coordinated and constructed as much as possible, striving for common use. If they cannot be used together, they can be built separately. If built separately, trade grain depots should be built in towns along railways and navigable rivers to facilitate the regulation of grain market supply and demand and save transportation capacity. Financial grain depots should take into account the situation of key construction and decentralized grain supply to facilitate supply and dispatch.

    Before the completion of the new warehouses, existing warehouses and temples should be fully utilized, and private warehouses and houses should be rented to meet the needs of the work. Those that must be repaired can be repaired appropriately. Local people's governments at all levels must be responsible for solving the grain depot housing problems of the local grain management departments, and give priority to the needs of the central grain depots.

    2.  Public grain warehousing is limited to existing grain; strive to preserve the original grain in storage, and must be stored centrally; in places where conditions are not available, central storage should also be gradually achieved. Special attention should be paid to insect control, anti-corrosion, anti-theft, anti-special agents, and fire prevention in public grain storage; scientific storage methods should be promoted, and the guard of grain depots should be strengthened. All larger grain depots must have fire-fighting equipment.

    3.  Strictly implement the grain depot management and inspection system, establish a periodic inspection reporting system and a work reward and punishment system. The maximum loss of public grain shall not exceed 3%; in areas with stable environment, it should be less than 1.5% in principle.

    4.  When collecting and storing public grain, local people's governments at all levels and public grain collection workers must pay attention to the quality of the grain to reduce mildew and rot, and insect erosion during storage.

  III. Public Grain Dispatch:

    1.  The right to dispatch national public grain belongs to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government; Greater Administrative Regions and centrally administered provinces (municipalities) may dispatch the public grain they are entitled to receive according to the budget approved by the Central Government, but must strictly obey the plans of the Central Government, and must leave the grain that is easy to transport for the Central Government to allocate, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Central Government's unified dispatch plan as much as possible. The method of dispatching county local public grain will be determined separately.

    2.  All grain that has been determined to be allocated to the central trade grain should be transported to the central trade grain depot at one time as much as possible during collection. If the warehouse space is insufficient, local people's governments at all levels should be responsible for assisting in temporarily borrowing civilian houses for use.

    3.  The transportation of financial supply grain is the responsibility of the grain department. The method of handover and transportation of national public grain allocated as trade grain shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government through consultation.

    4.  Public grain transportation methods are divided into two types: voluntary and hired. When public grain is collected and stored, taxpayers have the obligation to transport public grain to and from a distance of one hundred *huali*. For transportation distances exceeding this, compensation will be given according to local market prices; after the public grain is stored, if there is further transportation, it must be transported by hired labor in accordance with the nature of commercial transportation; if the amount of public grain transported is too large or the dispatch time is tight, and it is difficult to hire labor, the local people's government may requisition labor, but still need to pay according to market prices.

　　中央人民政府政务院发布决定
    统一国家公粮收支保管调度
    保障军需民食，调节市场供求，实现本年财政收支概算。
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院顷发布关于统一国家公粮收支、保管、调度的决定（一九五零年三月二十四日政务院第二十五次政务会议通过）全文如下：
    为健全与统一国家公粮收支、保管和调度的制度，以保障军需民食，调节粮食市场供求和实现一九五○年国家财政收支概算，特作如下决定：
  一、公粮收支：
    １、征收国家公粮的税则和税率，统由中央人民政府政务院规定，各级地方人民政府不得自定或修改。国家公粮征收任务的分配，由中央人民政府政务院依据各地实际情况决定之。各级地方人民政府，必须严格遵照中央规定的税则、税率和征粮政策，谨慎而正确地进行征收，完成任务。凡超过中央所分配的公粮任务，又未违反中央所规定的征粮政策和法令者，其超过之数额，得按二八提成奖励，即八成留归地方，二成上解中央。各县附加征收的地方公粮，其比例不得超过正粮的百分之十五，并须报经省人民政府审查转报大行政区人民政府批准。各省人民政府及专员公署并得根据所辖各县地方财政具体情况，对地方公粮加以适当的调度和调剂。
    ２、实行严格的公粮入库制度：国家公粮入中央公粮库；县地方粮入县公粮库。为加强国家公粮管理，中央设粮食管理总局，受中央人民政府财政部领导。大行政区设粮食管理局，受中央粮食管理总局及大行政区财政部双重领导。省设省粮食局，受大行政区粮食管理局及省财政厅双重领导；中央直辖省，则受中央粮食管理总局及省财政厅双重领导。专区得设粮食分局及中央公粮区库、县得设中央公粮分库，均受上级粮食局、库及同级政府双重领导。各级粮食局及中央公粮库，其主要职责为管理国家公粮，其他有关农业税调查、土地评丈及征收公粮等工作，应由各级人民政府领导各级财政部门执行，以专责成。其组织规程及职权划分另定之。
    ３、严格执行公粮支付制度：入库公粮，除县地方公粮及个别情况特殊地区经中央授权者外，统由中央人民政府财政部指拨，其他任何机关或个人，不得动支，违者给以应得之处分。
    ４、确定国家公粮使用范围：除去拨抵经费的粮食外，其他开支，凡能以货币或实物支付者，一律不得支用国家公粮；国家公粮支出只限于部队及区以上政府机关团体的人马食用粮、公立学校供给制教职员公费生的食用粮、救灾粮、优抚粮、婴儿保育粮、参战的民工食用粮及部分治河粮；其余应尽先拨充贸易粮，以调剂民食，回笼货币。
    ５、各级人民政府和人民解放军均须按规定编制内的实有人数，分别编造年度和季度需粮预算表，逐级审查汇总层报，政府系统，由中央人民政府财政部核定拨发；军队系统，由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总后勤部汇总报中央人民政府财政部核定拨发。各大行政区及中央直辖省（市）需用粮食预算经核定后，即由中央人民政府财政部每年一次或分两次拨给。
    ６、国家公粮支出一律用三联式的指拨令，逐渐废除粮票制度。国家公粮指拨令，由中央人民政府财政部长签发，大行政区及中央直辖省（市）在批准领拨之公粮数额内，得由大行政区财政部长或直辖省（市）财政厅（局）长签发。县地方公粮指拨令由县长签发。
    ７、各级粮食局及中央公粮库须建立按期的公粮收支解报制度和按月的公粮收支表报制度，如按月表报困难者，亦须实行定期的公粮收支情况报告制度，以便中央能掌握全国国家公粮收支情况，使库存与账面经常可保持一致。
  二、公粮保管：
    １、粮库修建按左列规定办理：
    有计划地在三、四年内建设粮食仓库及加工工厂。县地方公粮库修建计划由县人民政府拟定，报经省人民政府批准后，从一九五一年起逐渐修建。中央公粮库及加工工厂，其粮食保存与加工属于财政供给所需者为财政粮库，由中央人民政府财政部或委托大行政区财政部拟定修建计划；其粮食保存与加工属于贸易部门调节市场供求所需而又不能与财政粮库合用者得另建贸易粮库，由中央人民政府贸易部拟定修建计划。以上两种中央公粮库及加工工厂的修建计划，均于报经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准后，始得筹办或修建。
    建库地点，贸易粮库与财政粮库，应尽可能地配合修建，争取共同使用。其不能共同使用者，始得分开修建。如分开修建，贸易粮库，为便于调节粮食市场供求，节省运输力，应建设在铁道及通航的河流沿线的城镇。财政粮库，为便于供给、调度，应兼顾重点建设与分散供应粮食的情况。
    在新的仓库修建未完成以前，为适应工作需要，应充分利用现有仓库和庙宇、祠堂，并租用私人的仓库和房屋，其必须修理者可酌予修理。各级地方人民政府必须负责解决当地粮食管理部门的粮库房屋问题，并尽先照顾中央粮库的需要。
    ２、公粮入库以现粮为限；保管上争取保存原粮，并须集中储存，在条件不具备的地方亦应争取逐步做到集中储存。公粮保管，应特别注意防虫、防腐、防盗、防特与防火；提倡科学保管方法，加强粮库警卫，一切较大粮库均须有防火设备。
    ３、严格执行粮库管理和检查制度，建立定期的检查报告制度和工作奖惩制度。公粮损耗最高不得超过百分之三，环境稳定地区，应以不超过百分之一点五为原则。
    ４、公粮征收入库时，各级地方人民政府及征收公粮的工作人员，必须注意粮食的质量，以减少保管中的霉腐、虫蚀。
  三、公粮调度：
    １、国家公粮的调度权属于中央人民政府财政部；大行政区及中央直辖省（市）依中央批准的预算，可调度其应领之公粮，但必须严格服从中央的计划，并须把容易运出的粮食留归中央调拨，以尽量便利中央统一调度计划的实施为原则。县地方公粮之调度办法另订之。
    ２、凡已确定拨充中央贸易粮者，应尽可能在征收时一次运入中央贸易粮库，如库房不敷时，各级地方人民政府应负责协助暂借民房使用。
    ３、财政供给粮的运输由粮食部门负责。国家公粮拨作贸易粮者，其交接运输办法，由中央人民政府财政部和贸易部协商订定之。
    ４、公粮运输方法，分为义务与雇佣两种。公粮征收入库时，纳粮人有往返一百华里运输公粮的义务。运输里程超过部分，按当地市价给资；公粮入库后，再有转运时，即须按商运性质雇脚运送；如遇公粮运输数量过大或调度时间紧迫，且雇脚力困难时，得由当地人民政府征雇，但仍须按市价给资。
