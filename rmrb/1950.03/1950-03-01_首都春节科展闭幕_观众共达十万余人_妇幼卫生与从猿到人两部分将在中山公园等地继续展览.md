　　Capital Spring Festival Science Exhibition Closes
　　Audience Reaches Over 100,000
　　Maternal and Child Health and From Ape to Man Sections Will Continue Exhibition in Zhongshan Park and Other Places

    [Our Newspaper's News] The Beijing Spring Festival Science Knowledge Exhibition, jointly organized by the Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and more than 30 schools, institutions, and organizations in Beijing, successfully closed yesterday (the 28th) at 4 p.m. The exhibition was originally scheduled to last for ten days (from February 17th to 26th), but was extended by two days at the request of the audience. Over the twelve days, the number of visitors totaled more than 100,000 (including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, cadres, general citizens, housewives, etc., and more than 150 units organized group visits).

    The exhibition was divided into three parts: Maternal and Child Health, From Ape to Man, and General Scientific Knowledge. Because the selection of exhibition materials focused on serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and popularizing scientific knowledge, the exhibition was warmly received by the broad masses of working people. Many peasants and soldiers traveled dozens of miles from the suburbs to visit. After viewing the displayed models, specimens, and charts, and listening to the explanations of the staff in each section, the audience was very satisfied. They unanimously agreed that they had gained a lot of knowledge here. Some people broke with religious superstitions; others saw the concrete development process from ape to man, solving problems in their study of historical materialism; many working people, after seeing the comparison of new and old childbirth methods and the section on maternal and infant health knowledge, said: "In the past, we didn't know these things, and don't know how many people lost their lives in confusion." They understood that the adoption of many scientific health methods is not very difficult. As long as old habits are reformed, many deaths can be reduced and the health of the next generation can be improved.

    In addition to the staff of various units, more than 2,000 university professors and middle school students were mobilized for the exhibition's layout, management, order maintenance, explanation, and other venue service work. Yuan Hanqing, Director of the Science Popularization Bureau, and Professors Pei Wenzhong, Han Shou Xuan, Qi Kaizhi, and Gu Zhengrong either took charge of the entire venue, or answered questions raised by the audience in the exhibition hall. They arrived at the venue before 9 a.m. every day and did not leave until the audience had left in the afternoon. Afterwards, they also presided over criticism, self-criticism, and other work, often staying up late. The students who participated in the service work were all afraid of not providing adequate service. Many twelve or thirteen-year-old junior high school students persisted in maintaining order inside and outside the venue for several hours in the wind and sand, and there were no disputes or disturbances from the opening to the closing; the students and medical workers responsible for the explanation enthusiastically and actively explained to the masses, carefully answered the questions of the masses, and became one with the audience. Some people wrote down their names and addresses, leaving written questions requesting detailed answers.

    During the exhibition period, the exhibition workers reviewed, studied, and improved the work day by day in order to better serve the audience. For example, the language used by the students responsible for the explanation was initially not popular enough, but they quickly improved it. In the first three days of the exhibition, there was only one entrance and exit in the entire venue, and some people felt that they could not "digest" all three parts in one visit, and it also made the venue too crowded; from the fourth day onwards, the exhibition improved its management and added one entrance and one exit; the entire venue was divided into two parts, which could be visited separately. This accommodated more visitors and allowed them to see more carefully over two days.

    Outside the exhibition hall, many people were unable to enter due to the limited capacity of the venue. After seeing it, many people wrote in the opinion book: there is too much material to see at once; it is hoped that the exhibition will be long-term or extended, so that they can see it carefully again in the future. Some people hope that this kind of exhibition can be taken to the countryside for a touring exhibition. In order to meet the needs of the masses, after the close of the exhibition, the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau plans to move the maternal and child health section to Zhongshan Park; the Beijing Library plans to move the "From Ape to Man" section to the library for continued exhibition.

　　首都春节科展闭幕
    观众共达十万余人
    妇幼卫生与从猿到人两部分将在中山公园等地继续展览
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部科学普及局领导、北京市三十余学校、机关、团体联合举办的北京市春节科学知识展览会已于昨（二十八）日下午四时胜利闭幕。该会原订展览十天（自二月十七至二十六日），后应观众要求延长了两天。十二天中，参观人数共计十万余人（包括工、农、兵、学生、干部、一般市民、家庭妇女等，并有一百五十多个单位集体参观）。
    展览会分妇幼卫生、从猿到人、一般科学知识三部分。由于展览材料的选择都掌握了面向工农兵，普及科学知识。因此展览会获得广大劳动人民的热爱。许多农民和战士从郊区数十里外赶来参观。观众看过陈列的模型、标本和图表，听过各部门解说人员的说明后，都感到很满意。一致认为在这里增长了不少见识。有的人打破了宗教迷信思想；有的人在这里真真切切地看到了从猿到人的具体发展过程，解决了学习唯物史观中的问题；很多劳动人民看过新旧接产方法的对比和妇婴卫生常识部分之后说：“过去我们不知道这些事情，不知有多少人糊糊涂涂丧失了生命。”他们明白了：许多科学卫生方法的采用并不是很困难的，只要改革了旧习惯，就可以减少许多死亡，增进下一代人的健康。
    展览会的布置、管理、维持秩序、解说和其他会场服务工作，除了各单位的工作人员参加之外，还动员了大学教授和大中学生两千多人。科学普及局袁翰青局长和裴文中、韩寿萱、祁开智、顾正容等教授或负责照顾整个会场工作，或在展览室解答观众提出的问题。他们每天上午九点以前就到会场，一直到下午观众走完才离开。会后又主持批评检讨等工作。他们每每忙到深夜。参加服务工作的同学们，大家唯恐服务不周到。许多十二三岁的初中同学，在风沙中坚持几个钟头维持场内场外的秩序，从开幕到闭幕从没有发生过纠纷和扰乱；负责解说的同学和医务工作者，热忱地主动向群众解释，仔仔细细回答群众的问题，和观众打成了一片。有的人写下姓名住址，留下书面问题请求详细解答。
    展览会的工作者在展览期中，逐日检讨研究改进，以便更好地为观众服务。例如负责解说的同学起初语言不通俗，以后很快就改进了。展览会的最初三天，全会场只有一个进口和出口，有的人感到要一次全部参观三个部分“消化不了”，而且使场内太拥挤；第四天起，展览会改进了管理，增辟进出口各一处；将全会场分为两部分，可以分开参观。这样容纳了更多的观众，也使他们可以分两天看得更仔细些。
    展览会的场外，每天有许多人限于会场容量不能入场参观。看过之后，有许多人在意见簿上写着：材料太多，一时看不过来；希望能长期展览或延长展览日期，将来再仔细看。有的人希望能把这种展览会拿到农村去巡回展出。为了满足群众的要求，展览会闭幕之后，北京市公共卫生局拟将妇幼卫生部分移到中山公园；北京图书馆拟将从猿到人部分移到该馆继续展览。
