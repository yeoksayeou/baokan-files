　　When the Sun Rises
    (Review of Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," originally published in the News Bulletin on October 22, 1949)
    By M. Xie Miaonov, Translated by Chen Bingyi

　　All progressive humanity joyfully celebrates the birth of the People's Republic of China, which, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has completed the Chinese people's many years of liberation struggle. The Soviet people warmly celebrate the great victory of the Chinese people and welcome every piece of news from the new China with great interest.

　　The magazine "Banner" has presented a good gift to Soviet readers by publishing the long novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" by the Chinese female writer Ding Ling.

　　Ding Ling is an active social activist who participated in the land reform work in rural China from 1946 to 1948. The protagonists of the novel are the people who are building a new life in the Chinese liberated areas in the struggle against landlords and feudal remnants.

　　The novel begins with the scene of the old farmer Gu returning to his hometown of Nuanshui Village:

　　"On both sides of the road and on the north bank of the Yanghe River, the rice ears were densely packed together. The millet was fat and tall, all up to a person's shoulder. The sorghum blocked everything, and the leaves were as wide as corn leaves, and the soil was moist and black. A kind of smell emanated from those crops...

　　"Every time Gu Lao Han passed through this area, he couldn't help but admire: how could he have such a good piece of land?"

　　But this old farmer's admiration was immediately overshadowed by his daughter's question:

　　"'Has Uncle Qian Er's willow tree been sawed down?'

　　"The old man didn't answer, just shook his head."

　　It turned out that Gu Lao Han's son accidentally cut a willow tree belonging to the landlord Qian Wengui when he was digging a canal. The willow tree fell down and pressed on the pear tree in Gu's garden. No matter how hard the old farmer begged the landlord to cut down the willow tree, the landlord always refused. Everyone in the village understood and watched the pear tree die year by year.

　　This short passage proves the intensity of the landlord's oppression in the countryside and the extent to which the peasants depend on these bloodsuckers.

　　Following the development of the novel, the author leads us into the circle of the characters' lives and shows the situation of the balance of class forces in the countryside. On the one hand, there are landlords headed by Qian Wengui, who dominates the whole village, and on the other hand, there are poor peasants headed by the leaders of the peasant associations founded by the Communists. These include Cheng Ren, the former tenant farmer and current chairman of the Farmers' Association, Dong Guihua, the director of the Women's Federation, and Zhang Yumin, the tenant farmer nicknamed Third Brother who has close ties with the Eighth Route Army, and so on.

　　Most of the peasants were tenant farmers who rented land from landlords at high prices. They suffered from poverty and lived a semi-starved life, but the oppression of many centuries was so powerful that they did not dare to shout out their voices against the exploiters.

　　The people who helped the landlord were the procuress Bai Niangniang and the teacher Ren Guozhong, who specialized in flattering the rich to seek leftovers. Ren Guozhong obeyed Qian Wengui's instigation and predicted everywhere that the Kuomintang would soon win.

　　At first, the cunning landlord's words seemed to be somewhat fulfilled. Rumors spread in the village that Chiang Kai-shek, who was being helped by the Americans, was launching a counter-offensive, and the People's Liberation Army was retreating. It seemed that the Kuomintang would really appear in Nuanshui Village again soon. The peasants were frightened by these provocative rumors. Tenant farmer Hou Zhongquan returned the land he had received from the Farmers' Association to the landlord. The people sent by the Farmers' Association to the landlord to retrieve the land deeds were all deceived by the landlord's women and returned without any results.

　　But since the Communist Party's county committee work team came to the village, the situation has changed. The old Communist Party member and guerrilla fighter Lao Dong, and the young propagandist Yang Liang united the activists and poor peasants in the village, giving people the conviction of victory.

　　Before the fruit was harvested, the fruit growing on the trees was really so heavy that it was about to break the trees. But the landlord refused to pick the fruit immediately and openly carried out sabotage. So the Farmers' Association decided to confiscate the landlord's fruit. Then the whole village rushed into the orchard:

　　"This is something that has never been heard of before, the rich man's fruit is being watched by the poor, and taken to the city to sell. As more and more people participated, those who were originally a little afraid, as if they were pregnant with some kind of ghost, no longer cared. ...This incident excited all the poor people in the village..."

　　The author confidently and skillfully describes the climax that controlled all the peasants. The will of the people was finally realized - Qian Wengui was arrested and will be tried by the whole village.

　　The peasants went to the court like attending a festival, singing war songs:

　　"Unite!
　　"Farmers who plant the land! ...
　　"The landlord oppressed us, oppressed us for many years,
　　"Let's... settle the accounts, settle the accounts!"

　　The trial of Qian Wengui, the hateful enemy of the poor peasants, is the most powerful part of the novel. The author truly and movingly expresses the people's anger against the exploiters. The old man Li Baotang was elected by the peasants as the chairman of the court. He felt very uneasy about this honor, but he maintained his dignity. The belief in the justice of this undertaking inspired him.

　　"I, an old man, am a poor man. I have looked after orchards for decades, but I don't have a single tree. I am sixty-one years old this year, and I am about to be buried in the ground like the leaves of a fruit tree in autumn. I never dreamed that I would be the chairman today! Good! I am happy that I am the chairman of the poor people. Today, we will have a good fight with that Qian Wengui, repay hatred with hatred, redress grievances, repay money with money, and repay life with life. I only have one mind, I am a poor man. I, the chairman, have finished speaking, now everyone speaks."

　　Then, one after another, the people who had been bullied by the landlord and who had been oppressed to live inhuman lives came forward to present their respective accusations.

　　The important task is to show how millions of Chinese laborers have awakened under the influence of the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong and how they are fighting for a new life - the author has brilliantly completed this task. The value of the novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" lies in this. It is a page in the history of the great Chinese people, who have now established the People's Republic and are starting construction work.

　　Ding Ling is very familiar with rural China. The descriptions of peasant life, peasant relations, scenery, etc., are very colorful and attractive. Gu Lao Han, the restrained and determined tenant farmer Cheng Ren, the intelligent and resourceful Yang Liang - Ding Ling has found their respective colors for them. The reader tensely follows the development of the characters' fate, and together with the author, cherishes deep sympathy and love for these characters of the new China.

　　There is no doubt that Soviet readers will read Ding Ling's novel with great interest.

　　太阳上升的时候
    （评丁玲著《桑乾河上》，原文载一九四九年十月二十二日消息报）
    Ｍ·谢妙诺夫作  陈冰夷译
    全体进步人类欣喜地祝贺中华人民共和国的诞生，它在共产党领导之下完成了中国人民进行了许多年的解放斗争。苏联人热烈地庆贺中国人民的伟大胜利，他们怀着极大的兴趣迎接来自新中国的每一个消息。
    《旗子》杂志献了一份很好的礼物给苏联读者，它发表了中国女作家丁玲的长篇小说《桑干河上》。
    丁玲是积极的社会活动家，她在一九四六至一九四八年参加过中国农村里的土地改革工作。小说的主人公是在中国解放区对地主和封建残余斗争中建设新生活的人们。
    小说以老农顾老汉回返故乡暖水屯的场面开始：
    “路两旁和洋河北岸一样，稻穗穗密密的挤着。谷子又肥又高，都齐人肩头了。高粱遮断了一切，叶子就如玉茭的叶子一样宽，泥土又湿又黑。从那些庄稼丛里，蒸发出一种气味。……
    “顾老汉每次走过这一带，就说不出的羡慕：怎么自己也有这末一片好地呢？”
    但是这个老农的羡慕立刻被他女儿的问话所遮暗了：
    “‘钱二叔的那棵柳树锯掉没有？’
    “老头子没有答应，只摇了一摇头。”
    原来顾老汉的儿子挖水渠时不留神砍伤了地主钱文贵的一棵柳树。柳树倒下来，压在顾家园子里的梨树上。老农无论怎么恳求那地主砍去柳树，那地主总是不肯。全村的人也明白，都看着那棵梨树一年年死下去。
    就这一小段就证明了农村里地主压迫的强烈和农民依赖这些吸血鬼之甚。
    跟着小说的发展，作者把我们领到小说人物生活的圈子里去，显示了农村里阶级力量对比的形势。一方面是以霸持全村的钱文贵为首的地主，另一方面是以共产党人创立的农民团体的领导者为首的贫农。就是从前是佃农现任农会主席的程仁妇联会主任董桂花，和八路军有密切关系的浑号三哥的佃农张裕民等等。
    农民大多是以高价向地主租地耕种的佃农。他们受着贫苦的压迫，过着半饥饿的生活，但是许多世纪来的压迫是这样有力，以致于他们还不敢高声喊出他们反对剥削者的呼声。
    给地主助纣为虐的有虔婆白娘娘和专事向财主献媚以谋取残羹的教员任国忠。任国忠唯命是听地受着钱文贵的教唆，到处预言国民党即将胜利。
    起初那狡猾的地主的话仿佛有点应验。村上流传谣言，说受美国人接济的蒋介石转取反攻，人民解放军败退，仿佛不久暖水屯真的又要出现国民党了。农民被这些挑拨性的谣言所吓坏了。佃农侯忠全把从农会得来的土地又还给地主。农会派到地主那里去取地契的人都受了地主的女人的骗，毫无收获而回。
    但是自从共产党县委工作团到村上来之后，情形转变了。老共产党员和游击队员老董，青年鼓动家杨亮把村上的积极分子和贫农团结起来，使人们有了胜利的信念。
    果子未收，树上长的果实真的重得要把树都折断了。但是地主不肯马上采果子，公开进行怠工。于是农会决定没收地主的果子。于是全村都冲到果园里去：
    “这是听也没听到的事呀，财主家的果子叫穷人们给看起来，给拿到城里去卖。参加的人一加多，那些原来有些怕的，好象怀了什么鬼胎的人，便也不在乎了。……这件事兴奋了全村的穷人……”
    作者自信地和有才力地描写出了那种控制住全体农民的高潮。人民的意愿终于实现，——钱文贵被捕，他将受到全村的审判。
    农民们象赴赛会似的到法庭上去，唱着战歌：
    “团结起来吧！
    “种地的庄稼汉！……
    “地主压迫咱，压迫了多少年，
    “咱们……把帐算，把帐算！
    审判贫农的可恶的敌人钱文贵这一场是小说中最有力的。作者真切地和动人地表达出了反抗剥削者的人民的怒火。被农民们选为法庭主席的是老人李宝堂。他得到了这光荣，感到非常局促不安，但是保持了他的尊严。相信这已开始的事业的正义性的信念鼓舞着他。
    “咱老汉是个穷人。看了几十年果园子，没有一棵树。咱今年六十一岁，就像秋天的果树叶一样入土也差不离了。做梦也没梦到有今天，咱当了主席啦！好！咱高兴咱是穷人的主席，咱们今天好好把那个钱文贵斗一斗，有仇报仇，有冤伸冤，有钱还钱，有命偿命。咱只有一个心眼，咱是个穷汉。咱主席说完了，如今大家说。”
    于是受过地主气的人，被他压迫得度着非人生活的人，一个一个跟着上来，提出他们各自的控诉。
    重要的任务是表现出：在毛泽东领导的共产党的影响之下，千百万中国劳动者怎样的觉醒了，怎样的进行争取新生活的斗争，——这一任务，作者是出色地完成了。小说《桑乾河上》的价值也就在此。它是伟大中国人民的历史的一页，这人民现在已经建立了人民共和国和着手建设工作了。
    丁玲很熟悉中国的农村。农民的生活、农民的关系、风景等等的描写非常富有色彩和吸引力。顾老汉，拘谨而信心坚定的佃农程仁聪明而有头脑的杨亮，——丁玲给他们都找到了他们各自的色彩。读者紧张地注意着书中人物命运的发展，跟着作者一起对新中国的这些人物怀着深深的同情和爱忱。
    毫无疑问，苏联读者将以极大的兴趣来阅读丁玲的这部小说。
