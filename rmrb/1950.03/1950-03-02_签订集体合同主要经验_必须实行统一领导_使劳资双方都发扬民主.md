　　Main Experiences in Signing Collective Contracts

    Unified Leadership is Essential
    Labor and Management Must Both Promote Democracy
    The labor bureaus of various provinces and cities have also gained the following main experiences in leading the work of signing collective contracts: First, the city's Federation of Trade Unions, Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Labor Bureau, and Federation of Industry and Commerce must jointly consult or organize a committee to provide unified leadership for the work of signing collective contracts, and achieve consistency in work steps and the ideological understanding of cadres. Under unified leadership, each unit should have a specific division of labor and cooperate in carrying out the work. The trade union mainly works with workers, the Labor Bureau can work with both labor and management, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce mainly work with the capitalist side. Work must be carried out simultaneously with both labor and management in order to sign smoothly; otherwise, if one side is active and the other is passive, it will easily cause the other side to have doubts and dissatisfaction, creating difficulties in signing the contract, or even leading to breakdown or stalemate. Second, labor and management must both promote democracy, conduct thorough discussions among their respective members, and make both parties aware of the need to conclude a contract. Then, after repeated deliberation, they should form their own committees, propose their own draft contracts, and elect an equal number of representatives to conduct negotiations and consultations on the principle of equality and voluntariness, and sign the contract on the principle of mutual benefit. The leadership role of cadres is mainly manifested in policy education for both labor and management, distinguishing between major and minor issues, large and small, currently possible and impossible, and mastering them, so as to avoid blind and uncentered disputes. Cadres should patiently persuade and guide, and strictly prevent acting as proxies. It should be known that the process of signing a collective contract is a process of organizing and educating workers and improving the capitalist's understanding of policies. Only in this way can the signed contract truly conform to the mutual benefit of labor and management, and both parties can voluntarily abide by it, conscientiously implement it, and promote the signing of collective contracts in other industries. Third, a collective contract is the best way to systematically resolve labor disputes on an industry-wide basis. However, in the same industry, there are differences in scale, machinery versus handicraft industries, and differences in business conditions, wages, and welfare levels. Therefore, the capitalist side should not simply rely on the old trade associations (in which large factories have the upper hand) to lead the signing of collective contracts, but should elect representatives from large, medium, and small factories in the industry to participate. Different contract signing methods should be determined according to the different industry conditions; either one collective contract is signed for an industry, with distinctions made between large and small factories in the contract; or different types are separated within the same industry, and collective contracts suitable for the conditions of this type are signed separately; or special factories in an industry, based on the spirit of the industry contract, sign separate sub-contracts individually. As for particularly small workshops, because most of them have unclear family and employment relationships, the feudal system of scolding and beating that exists should be abolished, and wages, working hours, and working conditions should not be required to be the same as those of large factories. Fourth, contracts should first be signed in industrial sectors with many disputes and relatively good business conditions in order to gain preliminary experience and demonstrate promotion. After a few contracts have been signed, experience should be summarized in a timely manner and used to widely call for and negotiate and sign a large number of contracts. Do not be timid and not trust the masses. Fifth, for those who cannot immediately sign a collective contract but have urgent problems to be solved, collective agreement methods should be adopted to deal with them. This is a preliminary form of signing a collective contract, which is simpler and faster than signing a collective contract, and is especially suitable for places where the worker masses have not been well organized and disputes need to be resolved urgently shortly after liberation, but the agreement should be discussed extensively by the masses to prevent a few representatives from acting as proxies. Sixth, after the contract is signed, inspection and supervision should be carried out to ensure its implementation, so as to discover and correct problems at any time. In addition, there are still some shortcomings in the work of signing collective contracts in various places: in many places, there is a tendency to rush to complete tasks and act as proxies, and the style of administrative orders is adopted, and not enough patience is given to explaining policies and thoroughly mobilizing the masses to implement them; in some places, the division of labor and cooperation under unified leadership is not close enough, resulting in the work not being able to be promoted well; in some areas, when discussing the draft contracts of labor and management, it is stipulated that the labor draft should be the main one, and the capitalist draft should only be used as a reference, which makes the capitalist feel unfair.

　　签订集体合同主要经验
    必须实行统一领导         
    使劳资双方都发扬民主
    各省市劳动局在领导签订集体合同的工作中，也取得以下主要经验：其一，必须由市总工会、工商局、劳动局、工商业联合会共同协商或组织委员会，统一领导签订集体合同的工作，取得工作步调及干部思想认识的一致。在统一领导下各单位具体分工，配合进行，工会主要进行工人工作，劳动局对劳资双方均可进行工作，工商联合会与工商局主要进行资方工作。对于劳资双方要同时进行工作，才能顺利签订，否则，如果对一方积极，对他方消极，就易使另一方发生怀疑与不满，造成签订合同中的困难，甚至陷于破裂或僵局。其二，必须使劳资双方都发扬民主，在各自的会员中切实讨论，使双方都认识到订立合同的需要，然后经过反复酝酿，组成各自方面的委员会，提出各自的合同草案，选举数量相等的代表，在平等自愿的原则下进行协商谈判，在两利原则下签订合同。干部的领导作用，主要表现在对劳资双方的政策教育，分别问题的主要和次要、大的和小的、目前可能的和不可能的，加以掌握，以免形成盲目的无中心的争论。干部要循循善诱，严防包办代替，须知集体合同的签订过程，就是组织教育工人和提高资方对政策认识的过程。这样签订的合同，才能真正合乎劳资两利，双方才能自愿遵守，认真执行，并能推动其他行业签订集体合同。其三，集体合同是以行业为单位系统地解决劳资争议的最好办法，但在同一行业中有规模大小、机器业与手工业的不同及营业好坏、工资福利高低悬殊等情况，因此，资方不能单纯依靠旧有同业公会（其中大厂号占优势）来领导集体合同的签订，而应选举包括该行业大、中、小厂号的代表参加。根据行业情况的不同，应确定不同的签订合同办法；或是一个行业订立一个集体合同，在合同中对大小工厂加以区别；或是同一行业内分开类型，分别订立适合本类型情况的集体合同；或是一个行业中的特殊厂号，根据该行业合同精神，单独订立分合同。至于特别小的作坊，因多系亲友、雇佣关系不明确，其存在着的封建打骂制度应予废除，在工资、工时、劳动条件等方面则不应要求订的和大厂一样。其四，首先要在纠纷多且营业情况较好的产业部门订立合同，以获得初步经验，示范推广。在已订数个合同后即应及时总结经验，用以广泛号召，大量协商订立，不可小手小脚，不相信群众。其五，对立刻不能签订集体合同而存有急待解决之问题者，则应采取集体协议方法予以处理。这是订立集体合同的初步形式，比订集体合同简单迅速，特别适用于刚解放不久，工人群众未很好组织、纠纷又急待解决的地方，但协议时应经过广泛的群众讨论，防止少数代表包办。其六，合同订立之后，应进行检查督促贯彻执行，以便发现问题随时纠正。此外，各地在签订集体合同工作中亦尚有若干缺点：有许多地方存在着急于完成任务和包办代替、行政命令的作风，耐心解释政策与深入发动群众执行作得不够；有些地方在统一领导分工配合上不够密切，致工作不能很好推进；有些地区在讨论劳资双方合同草案时，规定以劳方草案为主，资方草案只作参考，以致资方感到不公。
