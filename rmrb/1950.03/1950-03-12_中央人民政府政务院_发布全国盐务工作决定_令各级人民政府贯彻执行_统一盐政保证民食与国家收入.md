Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has reviewed and approved the "Decision on National Salt Affairs Work" from the National Salt Affairs Work Conference and issued the Government Order No. 2, Series Zhengze, hoping that governments at all levels will implement it. The full text of the "Decision on National Salt Affairs Work" is as follows:

　　The Central Government, in order to unify salt administration, strengthen production, transportation, sales, taxation, guarantee people's food and national revenue, convened the National Salt Affairs Conference to discuss the guidelines, tasks, organizational structure, production and sales relationships, and sales area divisions for 1950. The decisions are as follows:

　　(1) Concerning the Guidelines and Tasks of National Salt Affairs

　　In past dynasties, salt tax was one of the main sources of revenue for our country's finances. Moreover, due to the abundance of salt production, transportation and sales have always been more important than production. In the past, production, transportation, sales, and taxation were all under the unified management of salt affairs agencies. After the September 18th Incident, Japanese invaders occupied salt fields in the Northeast, Changlu, and other places, which led to the operation of public salt pans.

　　Currently, public salt pans in the Northeast account for approximately 70% of salt production, while public salt pans in Guannei (inside the passes) only account for 20%. In terms of transportation and sales, unified sales are implemented in the Northeast, while a policy of both public and private operation with free transportation and sales is adopted in Guannei. Overall, private operation still accounts for the major component of production, transportation, and sales. In terms of the division of labor in salt affairs, production and taxation in the Northeast and North China belong to finance, and transportation and sales belong to trade; production, sales, and taxation in East China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia all belong to finance.

　　Based on the above situation, the guidelines and tasks for 1950 are stipulated as follows:

　　1. Production: Adopt a policy of both public and private operation, determining production based on sales, improving quality, increasing output, and reducing costs. Salt fields that are concentrated in production, easy to manage, low in cost, high in quality, and convenient for transportation should increase investment, improve equipment, and be restored and developed. Salt fields that have no prospects for development but are needed for local people's food and where salt workers cannot easily change jobs should temporarily maintain the status quo. Salt fields with very poor conditions, little impact on people's food, and where salt workers can easily change jobs should gradually reduce production and eventually be abolished.

　　Production Task: It is determined that the total output of public and private salt pans this year, based on the current foundation, will be 68.42 million dan (Taiwan not included).

　　2. Transportation and Sales: Continue unified sales in the Northeast, and adopt a policy of both public and private transportation and sales in other parts of Guannei. In areas where production and sales are separated, the salt companies shall be responsible. In addition to the 2 million dan of salt allocated by the state as investment, attention should still be paid to absorbing private capital to expand transportation and sales.

　　Transportation and Sales Task: It is determined that domestic sales of edible salt this year will be 37.06 million dan, industrial and fishery salt will be 6.5 million dan, and efforts will be made to export 12 million dan, totaling 55.56 million dan.

　　3. Taxation: In order to take care of financial needs, adopt a policy of "increasing tax rates" and "no repeated taxation." Before the war, the general salt tax was approximately 130 to 170 jin of rice per dan. During the Anti-Japanese War, the tax rate appeared to be lowered, but in reality, there were layers of blockades and taxes at every level, and the price of salt in the sales areas was higher than before the war. Now that transportation has been restored and transportation and sales are unimpeded, repeated taxation has been abolished, and tax rates have been increased, which is estimated to have little impact on people's lives.

　　Tax Rates in Each Region are Specified: 175 jin of sorghum per dan in the Northeast, 80 jin of millet per dan for local salt in the Northwest, 90 jin of wheat per dan for Lu salt, 80 jin of rice per dan for Huainan salt in East China. Except for the tax rate in Inner Mongolia, which will be determined separately, the salt tax in other regions will be 100 jin of millet (or rice) per dan. In order to encourage production and export, industrial, agricultural, and export salt are all exempt from tax, and fishery salt is taxed at 30% of the edible salt tax rate.

　　Tax Revenue Task: The total amount of edible salt tax and fishery salt tax this year must be equivalent to 3.2 billion jin of grain. In order to guarantee revenue, the salt tax can be adjusted at any time by the Salt Affairs General Bureau authorizing the salt affairs administrations and directly affiliated bureaus in each region according to the grain price in the designated area.

　　4. Anti-Smuggling: Basically, we must rely on organizing the masses to combat smuggling, but we should also appropriately expand the anti-smuggling armed forces to combine anti-smuggling in the producing areas and sales areas, and cooperate with other anti-smuggling efforts to achieve mutual assistance. In addition, we should set up agencies in key areas, strengthen the management of local salt, and appropriately stipulate tax rates to limit its production. At the same time, we must work with local governments and agricultural departments to improve salt field soil, develop farmland, and help salt workers change jobs.

　　5. Division of Labor in Salt Affairs: According to the needs of the national economy, a large division of labor system of production belonging to industry, transportation belonging to trade, and taxation belonging to finance should originally be adopted in order to achieve strict division of labor and specialized responsibility. However, the change from unification to separate management is very large, and the preparation is not enough, which is detrimental to the work. Therefore, the first step can only be to adopt the policy of unified production and taxation and separate transportation and sales. Except for the Northwest and Inner Mongolia, which will temporarily maintain the status quo, and the Northeast, which will continue unified sales, the transportation and sales work in North China, East China, Central South, and other regions will be uniformly undertaken by the salt companies at all levels designated by the trade departments. The Southwest will be determined separately. Production, taxation, and anti-smuggling are determined to be still under the responsibility of the salt bureaus at all levels of the finance departments.

　　(2) Concerning the National Salt Affairs Organization

　　The national salt affairs organization adopts a five-level system. The Ministry of Finance of the Central Government establishes the Salt Affairs General Bureau, each major district establishes a district salt affairs administration, which in turn establishes a directly affiliated or district-affiliated salt affairs administration, which in turn establishes a salt field management office or branch field office. Due to different conditions in various regions, except for North China and Central South, which do not set up district bureaus and are directly led by the General Bureau, the remaining districts all set up district bureaus, which are under the dual leadership of the General Bureau and the finance departments of the major administrative regions. The staffing at all levels should be based on the principle of simplification. The number of cadres and staff can be determined according to the needs of the work. The organizational regulations and the staffing of the People's Salt Police Team will be determined separately.

　　(3) Concerning Production and Sales Relationships

　　1. In order to strengthen the planning of transportation and sales work, the salt production in each region, except for the Northeast, Northwest, and Inner Mongolia, regardless of whether it is sold locally or sold outside, shall be uniformly managed by the salt company, which shall be responsible for grasping market prices and adjusting supply and demand relationships. The field price and tax rate shall be stipulated by the salt bureau and posted by the company. The tax payment shall be directly delivered to the state treasury by the company, and the tax ticket shall be exchanged from the salt bureau with the state treasury receipt to transport the salt. Within the company's transportation and sales area, all transportation and sales of edible salt, washing salt, reprocessed salt, and export salt, as well as the management of transporters, shall be handled by the company, but the issuance of tax tickets, the sale of industrial, agricultural, and fishery salt, and the investigation and handling of private salt shall still be handled by the salt bureau.

　　2. The company should guarantee the completion of the 20 million dan task of domestic sales of edible salt in North China, East China, and Central South (excluding Guangdong, Guangxi, and Taiwan), but the salt bureau can offset the tax collection of local salt and the salt sold by scattered salt fields within the company's jurisdiction within the transportation and sales task.

　　3. The salt bureau should guarantee the output and quality of salt, and export salt must be tested. The company should guarantee the sales volume of salt and guarantee the grain, cloth, and fuel needed by the salt fields. At the same time, the company must pay attention to preventing the mixing of stones and sand in the transportation and sales process to ensure the purity of the salt quality.

　　4. The salt bureau and the company should establish a scientific system of division of labor and cooperation, maintain close contact, exchange information, and exchange experiences. In the future, all policy issues should be reported to the higher-level leading organs by both parties for decision, and general issues should be handled by both parties in accordance with this spirit to conclude a contract.

　　(4) Concerning the Division of Sales Areas

　　In the past, salt affairs divided the country into fourteen producing areas and eight sales areas. Now, it is re-divided into seven sales areas according to major administrative regions:

　　1. Northeast: Supply and sell within the region, and export surplus salt abroad.

　　2. North China: Mainly based on Changlu salt, supply and sell Hebei, Pingyuan provinces, Taiyuan area in central Shanxi, parts of southern Chahar, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and eastern Suiyuan, and supply surplus salt to Central China and export abroad. Lu salt is sold in southern Shanxi, eastern Shaanxi, and western Henan.

　　3. East China: Supply and sell within the region, and supply surplus salt to Central South and export abroad.

　　4. Northwest: Supply and sell within the region and western Suiyuan.

　　5. Southwest: Supply and sell within the region. Sichuan salt is sold in western Hubei, western Hunan, and parts of southern Shaanxi.

　　6. Central South: Yue salt is supplied and sold in Guangdong and Guangxi, and surplus salt is sold in parts of southern Hunan and southern Jiangxi.

　　7. Inner Mongolia: Supply and sell within the autonomous region, sell outside to eight counties in northern Chahar and seven counties and one banner in northern Rehe.

　　Also: Lu and Lu salt are sold together in western Henan, Lu, Huai, and Shandong salt are sold together in eastern Henan, Lu and Huai salt are sold together in southern Henan, northern Henan, northern Jiangxi, northern Hunan, eastern Hubei, and northern Hubei, Sichuan and Huai salt are sold together in western Hubei and western Hunan, Huai and Yue salt are sold together in southern Hunan, and part of Yue salt is sold in southern Jiangxi, and part of Zhejiang salt is sold in eastern Jiangxi.

　　Governments at all levels and financial departments at all levels must earnestly study and implement the above decisions to ensure that people have no salt shortage and that there is no private leakage of taxes, thereby ensuring the victorious completion of the 1950 financial tasks.

　　中央人民政府政务院
    发布全国盐务工作决定
    令各级人民政府贯彻执行
    统一盐政保证民食与国家收入
    【新华社北京十一日电】中央人民政府政务院业经审查批准全国盐务工作会议关于全国盐务工作的决定，并发出政则字第二号院令，希各级政府贯彻执行。“关于全国盐务工作的决定”全文如下：
    中央为统一盐政，加强生产、运销、税收，保证民食与国家收入，召开了全国盐务会议，讨论了一九五○年的方针、任务、组织机构、产销关系和销区划分几个问题，决定如下：
  （一）关于全国盐务方针、任务
    我国历代财政，盐税为主要收入之一。又因盐产丰富，故运销一向重于生产，过去生产运销税收，均统一属盐务机关管理，九一八事变后，日寇在东北长芦等地霸占盐田，由此才有公营盐滩的经营。
    目前盐产情况，东北公营盐滩约占百分之七十，关内公营盐滩才占百分之二十。运销方面，东北已实行统销，关内则采取公私兼营自由运销的方针。综合起来生产运销私营仍占主要成份。在盐务分工方面，东北华北生产税收属财政、运销属贸易；华东西北内蒙产销税均属财政。
    依据上述情况，规定一九五○年度方针和任务如下：
    一、生产方面：采取公私兼制，按销定产，提高质量，增加产量，减低成本的方针。凡产盐集中、便于管理、成本低质量高、运输便利的盐场，应增加投资，改进设备，加以恢复与发展。凡无发展前途、但为当地民食所需要、而盐工又不易立即转业的盐场，均暂维持现状。凡条件很差、对民食无大关系、盐工又易于转业的盐场，应逐渐减产以至最后裁废。
    生产任务：确定本年公私盐滩，在现有基础上，定为六、八四二万担（台湾未计算在内）。
    二、运销方面：东北继续统销，关内各地采取公私兼运兼销的方针，凡是产销分开的地区，由盐业公司负担，资金除国家增拨二百万担盐作为投资外，仍须注意吸收私资扩大运销。
    运销任务：本年内销食盐，确定为三、七○六万担，工渔用盐六五○万担，对外争取输出一、二○○万担，三项共计五、五五六万担。
    三、税收方面：为照顾财政需要，采取“提高税额”与“税不重征”的方针。从量核定，就场征收。战前一般盐税，每担约为一百三十斤至一百七十斤米，抗战期间表面看去降低，实则层层封锁，节节征税，销区盐价反较战前为高。现因交通恢复，运销无阻，取消了重征，提高税额，估计对人民生活影响不大。
    规定各区税额：东北每担征高粱一百七十五斤，西北土盐每担征小米八十斤，潞盐每担征小麦九十斤，华东淮南盐每担征大米八十斤，除内蒙税额另定外，其他各地盐税每担一律征小米（或大米）一百斤。为了鼓励生产和出口，工农业用盐及出口盐全部免税，渔业用盐按食盐税率百分之三十征收。
    税收任务：本年食盐税及渔盐税必成数折食粮三十二亿斤。为保证收入，盐税可按指定地区之粮价，由盐务总局授权各区盐务管理局及直属局随时调整。
    四、缉私方面：基本上要依靠组织群众缉私，但亦应适当地扩大缉私武装，使产区与销区缉私相结合，并配合其他缉私，以收互助之效。此外，并应有重点地设置机构，加强土盐管理，适当规定税率，以便限制其生产。同时，要结合地方政府及农业部门，改良盐场土壤，开拓农田，帮助盐工的转业。
    五、盐务分工方面：根据国家经济要求，原应采取生产归工业、运输归贸易、税收归财政的大分工制，以求达到分工严、责任专。但由统一走向分管，变化很大，准备不够，反于工作不利，因此，第一步只能采取产税统一与运销分开的方针。除西北内蒙暂维现状、东北继续统销外，华北华东中南等区的运销工作，统由贸易部门指定其各级盐业公司负责，西南另定。生产、税收、缉私确定仍由财政部门的各级盐局负责。
  （二）关于全国盐务组织机构
    全国盐务组织，采取五级制。中央财政部设盐务总局，各大区设区盐务管理局，其下设直属或区属盐务管理局，其下设盐场管理处或分场场务所。由于各地情况不同，除华北中南不设区局归总局直接领导外，其余各区均设区局，受总局及各大行政区财政部的双重领导。各级编制，以精简为原则，干部员额可根据工作需要确定，组织条例及人民盐警队的编制另定。
  （三）关于产销关系
    一、为加强运销工作的计划性，各区产盐，除东北西北内蒙外，不论本销外销，均由盐业公司统一管理，并负责掌握市场价格、调剂供求关系。场价及税额均由盐局规定，公司挂牌。税款由公司直接送交国库，凭国库收据向盐局换取税票运盐。在公司运销区内，所有食盐、洗涤盐、再制盐、出口盐之运销以及运商管理，均由公司办理，但税票的填发，工农渔盐的发售，私盐的查缉和处理，仍归盐局办理。
    二、公司在华北、华东、中南（两广台湾在外）内销食盐，应保证完成二○○○万担的任务，但盐局可将公司辖区内的土盐征税及零星盐场所售盐斤，抵算在运销任务内。
    三、盐局要保证盐的产量与质量，出口盐须经过化验，公司要保证盐的销量，并保证盐场所需要的粮食、布匹、燃料。同时公司在运销中须注意防止掺石掺沙，以保证盐质的纯洁。
    四、盐局与公司要建立科学的分工合作制度，密切联系，互通情报，交流经验。今后凡有关政策性的问题，应由双方报上级领导机关决定，一般问题，则由双方本此精神订立合同办理。
  （四）关于销区划分
    过去盐务曾将全国划分为十四个产区，八个销区。现在按大行政区重新划分为七个销区：
    一、东北：供销本区，余盐输出国外。
    二、华北：以长芦盐为主，供销河北、平原两省、晋中太原一带，察南、张家口、大同、绥东各一部，余盐接济华中区及输出国外。潞盐行销晋南陕东豫西一带。
    三、华东：供销本区，余盐接济中南及输出国外。
    四、西北：供销本区及绥西。
    五、西南：供销本区。川盐行销鄂西、湘西、陕南各一部。
    六、中南：粤盐供销广东、广西，余盐行销湘南、赣南各一部。
    七、内蒙：供销本自治区，外销察北八县，热北七县一旗。
    再：豫西芦潞盐并销，豫东芦淮鲁盐并销，豫南、豫北、赣北、湘北、鄂东、鄂北芦淮盐并销，鄂西、湘西川淮盐并销，湘南淮粤盐并销，赣南行销粤盐一部，赣东行销浙盐一部。
    以上决定，各级政府及各级财经部门，必须认真研究，切实执行。使民无盐荒，税无私漏，从而保证一九五○年财政任务的胜利完成。
