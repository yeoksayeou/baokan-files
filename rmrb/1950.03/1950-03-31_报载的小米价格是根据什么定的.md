　　What is the basis for the millet prices reported in the newspaper?
　　Question: (1) What is the basis for the daily reported millet price? (2) What grain stores' retail prices are used as the basis for the reported price of *fudi* millet? (3) Why is the reported price of *fudi* millet 1700 yuan, when the wholesale price of millet in the northern section of Baoding is 1400 yuan? (4) Why is the price of millet higher than the price of wheat from Shijiazhuang?
　　　　(Li Wen)
　　Answer: (1) The daily reported wholesale price of millet is the actual transaction price of the municipal grain exchange. Due to the variety of qualities, the price is based on the medium quality and the most frequently traded type (the standard is millet produced around Qingyundian, which is lower in quality than Caiyu millet, but better than others).
　　(2) The retail price of *fudi* millet is selected from the market prices of several more substantial grain stores in the four city districts (taking the median price of these). The stores regularly surveyed include Hongchengyong, Xingmaocheng, Yisheng, Longchanghou, Rishengheng, and others.
　　(3) The price of millet in the northern section of Baoding, 1400 or 1500 yuan, is for a lower quality compared to the *fudi* millet sold in this city (millet in the Baoding area is white millet). Moreover, the reported millet price is specified as the Beijing market price, and does not include other locations.
　　(4) It is true that the current price of *fudi* millet is higher than the price of wheat from Shijiazhuang. There are three main reasons for this: (1) Since the Spring Festival, the sales volume of flour has decreased; (2) Flour mills process on behalf of the grain company, and the company supplies wheat as raw material without any problem; (3) There is an abundant supply of imported wheat at a lower price. Also, if it is the wheat harvest season, wheat prices will be lower than millet prices.

### 报载的小米价格是根据什么定的

　　报载的小米价格是根据什么定的
    问：（一）每日报载小米价格，系何根据？（二）伏地小米零售价系根据那几家粮店的门市行情？（三）保定北段小米批发价为一四○○元，为何报载伏地小米为一七○○元？（四）小米价为何较石门麦价昂？
        （李雯）
    答：（一）每日报载的小米批发价系本市粮食交易所实际成交价格。由于品种不齐，故采取中等质量及成交最多的价格为根据（青云店一带所产为标准，质量比采育米次，比其它较好）。
    （二）伏地小米零售价系选择四城较殷实之几家粮店之门市价格（取其较中等的众数价格）。经常调查的有鸿成永、兴茂成、益盛、隆昌厚、日升恒等几家。
    （三）保定北段米价一四○○元或一五○○元与本市出售伏地小米比较品质差（保定一带小米系白小米）。而且报载米价，已注明系北京市场价格，并未包括其他地方。
    （四）目前伏地小米较石门小麦价高是实。主要原因有三：（１）自春节后面粉销量减少，（２）面粉厂代粮食公司加工，小麦由公司供给原料不成问题。（３）口小麦来源丰裕价格较低。又如遇麦收时期，小麦也要低于小米价。
