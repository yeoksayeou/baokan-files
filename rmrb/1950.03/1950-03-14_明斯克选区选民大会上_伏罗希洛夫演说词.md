Xinhua News Agency, Minsk, March 8th (TASS dispatch): The voters of the Minsk city electoral district held a meeting on the 7th with their candidate, Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov. Representatives of employees from various enterprises, construction sites, railway junctions, labor people's organizations and groups, and troops stationed in the Belorussian capital all gathered at the Minsk District Officers' Club.

Amidst stormy and prolonged cheers, the assembly elected the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), headed by the great Stalin, as the honorary presidium. Enthusiastic cheers resounded throughout the hall.

Saizov, a Stakhanovite worker from the Minsk Tractor Factory and supervisor of the twenty-sixth electoral district, delivered a speech.

He said: All Soviet people nominate the great Stalin—the creator of all our victories—with pride and love as their first candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (stormy and prolonged applause). The working men and women of Minsk have nominated you, the great Stalin's faithful comrade-in-arms, dear Kliment Yefremovich, as their candidate for deputy to the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (stormy and prolonged applause).

On election day, we will all vote for the Stalin's Party and non-Party alliance candidates, to vote for you, our dear Kliment Yefremovich. We know that when we vote for the Stalin's Party and non-Party alliance candidates, we are voting for our own Stalin, voting in favor of the further growth of our national strength, and in favor of the continuous development of our national economy, science, technology, and culture.

Poet Maxim Tank, a Stalin Prize laureate, then spoke. He recited poems praising the great Stalin and his faithful comrade-in-arms Voroshilov, concluding his speech.

Smirnov, a famous Stakhanovite worker from the Voroshilov Machine-Building Factory, then spoke. Subsequently, Bakumeiko, an engineer from the woodworking department of the Molotov Radio Factory, Platonov, a Stalin Prize laureate and People's Artist of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Yermolenko, an academician of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic Academy of Sciences, Colonel Ivashkevich, and others also delivered speeches. They praised the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and Stalin, the great teacher of progressive humanity, with words of love and loyalty. The speakers called on voters to vote on March 12, the national holiday, for the candidate for deputy to the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR—Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and Marshal of the Soviet Union—Voroshilov.

When Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov, the candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, rose to speak, he was warmly welcomed by the entire assembly.

The assembly passed a telegram of congratulations to Stalin, the best friend of the Belorussian people, with great enthusiasm.

Voroshilov's speech is as follows:

Comrades! You have once again given me the great honor and trust of nominating me as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from the Minsk electoral district. I sincerely thank you, comrades, for your trust in me (prolonged applause).

I first attribute this lofty honor and trust to our great and glorious party of Lenin and Stalin and to our genius leader Stalin (stormy applause).

The party of Lenin and Stalin and our leader and teacher, the great Stalin, have guaranteed and continue to guarantee the victory and peace of our people and the success of our socialist construction (applause; all rise; cheers for Comrade Stalin).

As a candidate of Stalin's Party and non-Party alliance, I personally assure you and all my constituents—citizens of the Belorussian capital—that I will always be a loyal son of our own party of Lenin and Stalin, I will steadfastly follow the party's line in my work, and I will listen to the teachings and guidance of our great leader Comrade Stalin at all times and in all places (applause).

Comrades! The election day for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is approaching. Our entire country and all our strong and heroic people are summarizing with tremendous enthusiasm the achievements of the past four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the achievements and successes they have achieved on the peaceful front of socialist construction in these years. The Soviet people look with justifiable pride at the not-small victories they have already achieved and express their gratitude with boundless love to the organizer and creator of these victories, the great leader and teacher of the Soviet people and our Communist Party, Stalin (stormy applause; attendees rise; cheers: "Glory to the great Stalin!" "Long live Comrade Stalin!").

Socialist Countries are Advancing Towards Communism with Giant Strides

We people living and working in the Stalin era have unparalleled good fortune. The greatest geniuses of all ages, Marx and Engels, had already opened up and pointed out in the mid-19th century the path for mankind to liberate itself from capitalist enslavement and oppression. Lenin and Stalin, the geniuses who inherited the cause of Marx and Engels, turned the great theories of Marxism into a living reality, mobilizing the people of all nationalities in our country to engage in the great construction of a new socialist society on one-sixth of the earth.

And now, this new and unprecedented socialist country has passed thirty-two years, living, developing, and advancing with giant strides towards the next stage of its development—communism. We are currently in the twenty-seventh year since the death of our great genius, our Lenin. This is the twenty-seventh year that our great party of Lenin and Stalin and our powerful socialist country have been worthy of the successors of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, under the leadership of the great Stalin, overcoming all obstacles in their path, along their glorious road, from victory to victory (applause).

In such a historically short period of time, our country has, through the will and efforts and under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, under the brilliant guidance of the great leaders of communism, Lenin, Stalin, been transformed from a backward, feudal, capitalist country into a powerful, multi-ethnic, united, socialist country, with the most advanced social and state system in the world

Nine Years Ago, German Fascism, executing the will of German imperialism and easily deciding the fate of Europe at that time, decided to use force to destroy the fruits of the Soviet people, destroy the socialist country and enslave its people. The ending of this bloody adventure was the complete and disastrous defeat of the imperialist robbers and the victory of the Soviet people—the greatest victory in human history.

During the Great Patriotic War, under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin, under the supreme command of the genius commander Stalin, our people defended our independence in hard struggle and saved the people of the whole world from fascist barbarism (applause).

Comrade Stalin's prediction in his report to the 17th Party Congress has been completely fulfilled. He said, "We are for peace and uphold the cause of peace. However, we are not afraid of threats, and are prepared to respond to the blows of war instigators with blows. Those who desire peace and seek business relations with us will always receive our support. But those who dare to infringe upon our country will be met with crushing retaliation and taught a lesson never to stick their pig snouts into our Soviet garden again." (Enthusiastic applause lasting a long time).

The Soviet "garden"—our beloved motherland—is today continuing to bloom splendidly and happily. Next to it, new "gardens"—in the people's democratic countries—are also bursting into bloom (enthusiastic applause). However, disregarding warnings, pig snouts have not become extinct in this world, and even from across the ocean, their malicious howls can often be heard (laughter, applause).

The Soviet Union and Friendly Brotherly Nationalities Have a Long Common Border

Comrades! As a result of the epoch-making victory of the Soviet people over German fascism and Japanese imperialism, our socialist motherland stands tall on its historically ancient borders.

The long-separated people of Western Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldavia have finally united on their own soil into a unified and indestructible family.

In the north, the new borders provide a reliable shield for Leningrad.

In the east, the Soviet Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin guard our Far East.

East Prussia—the beehive and ancient base of the aggressive Junker system of Prussian Germany, where aggression against our motherland's territory was brewed and formed—no longer exists.

For the first time in its history, our socialist motherland has a long common border with brotherly nationalities friendly to our country. To the west, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, our neighbors are the free and peace-loving people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. The people of those countries that have firmly embarked on the road of socialist transformation are united with the people of our great motherland in eternal brotherly friendship.

The eastern border of our motherland is adjacent to friendly countries—the great People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The political and international significance of these achievements is not small. These were achieved by our heroic people under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin. The inspirer and organizer of these achievements is our teacher and leader Stalin (stormy applause).

Comrades! Let us not recall those past bleak years. Our memories are still fresh of the greatest events in history, the struggle our people engaged in against the German fascist aggressors and Japanese imperialists. The people of Belarus and Ukraine, who were the first to resist the treacherous assaults of the German fascist bandits, know particularly clearly the extent of the damage this war inflicted on their republics and on the entire Soviet Union.

But despite our great sacrifices, we still witness today the extraordinarily great achievements of the recovery of the national economy and its further improvement and growth.

When delivering a speech at the election assembly of the Stalin electoral district in Moscow in February 1946, Comrade Stalin said regarding future plans: "The main task of the new five-year plan is to restore our devastated regions, to restore industrial and agricultural production to pre-war levels, and then to exceed that level to a greater or lesser extent." Comrades, the wisdom of Comrade Stalin has already been reflected in these words of our leader. No one understands his people like Stalin, he believes in their great strength, and he has no doubt that the people will withstand the war unprecedented in human history, and will leap from the war into victors. Facing the heavy post-war difficulties, these people will never shrink, but will overcome these difficulties and move further along the road to new achievements in socialist construction.

Today, comrades, we are able to summarize the results of the implementation of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan with very satisfactory emotions. These results were achieved by the working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals of our country through intensive creative labor.

By the end of 1949, the total output of Soviet industry had exceeded the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1950. The total output of the entire socialist industry in 1949 had exceeded the pre-war output in 1940 by 41 percent. For a large number of industrial products, this percentage is even higher.

In the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, Soviet industry increased its output by more than 20 percent each year. Labor productivity has risen, production costs have been reduced, and the quality of products has improved. In these four years, 5,200 industrial enterprises have been restored or rebuilt, and all have started production.

Socialist cultivation has also demonstrated similar grand achievements in the post-war period. Thanks to the selfless efforts of the collective farm peasants, thanks to the constant attention of the party, the government, and Comrade Stalin himself to socialist agriculture, especially the technological, equipment, and organizational consolidation of collective farms and state farms in agriculture, we were able to solve the grain problem in a short period of time. Last year, the total grain harvest was 7.6 billion poods. Therefore, the total grain harvest far exceeded the total grain harvest in 1940, and it also almost reached the standard stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1950. Savings in grain have enabled collective and state farms to make a decisive transformation in the development of animal husbandry, and as a result, in 1949, the number of publicly owned livestock on collective farms exceeded the pre-war level of 1940. There is no doubt that the three-year plan for developing the publicly owned livestock breeding of collective and state farms formulated by our party and government will be completed on time and in full.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest year after year, great projects have been carried out in afforestation.

The technological equipment of socialist agriculture is developing at a very fast pace. In 1949 alone, the tractors, automobiles, and agricultural machinery obtained by collective and state farms were three to four times that of 1940.

The continuous improvement of the socialist collective farm property and the welfare and cultural level of collective farmers is a constant concern of the party, the Soviet government, and our great leader Comrade Stalin (applause).

The Cities and Collective Farms of Belarus Have Been Restored Almost as Good as New

The restoration and further development of industry, agriculture, and culture in the regions once occupied by the German fascist aggressors are also advancing at full speed.

Taking Soviet Belarus as an example, we can see how great the labor heroism of the Soviet people is, and how strong and indestructible the will of the people who were heroes on the battlefield yesterday and all the working people, who have restored enterprises, cities, and collective farms almost as good as new.

In 1946, I saw what the despicable enemy had done to the capital of Belarus. The ruins and semi-destroyed buildings scattered everywhere were all that remained of Minsk after the enemy was driven out.

Today, everywhere you can see the amazing results of the Belarusian people's great efforts over the past four years. This confirms the strength of the socialist country, the strength of our social system.

In the post-war years, the people of Belarus have made significant achievements in restoring and developing industry, agriculture, culture, and science.

The industry of the Belarusian Republic has greatly exceeded the pre-war level in many types of products. For example, this is the case in peat, cement, brick, textiles, food, meat, dairy, and other industries. Generally speaking, the level of local industries and republic-level industries in Belarus can ensure that the Five-Year Plan will be exceeded in 1950.

In Belarus, the area of farmland sown with various crops has approached pre-war levels. And the yield of various important crops has reached the pre-war level of 1940.

In terms of the number of schools and higher education institutions currently in operation and the number of students at all levels, Belarus has exceeded pre-war levels.

Comrades! After Belarus suffered enormous damage from the war, only under the conditions of our socialist society, and only under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the brilliant Stalin, could the wounds of war be healed and the blood stains of the Nazi occupation wiped out in such a short period of time.

On the basis of the steady progress and development of the socialist economy, living standards are constantly improving, and the welfare and cultural level of all Soviet people are constantly rising.

The Lives of the Soviet Working People Are Becoming More Abundant

For three years, the prices of food and manufactured goods have been reduced three times. Due to the reduction in state retail prices, the benefits obtained by the people in this year alone are estimated to reach 110 billion rubles. If we also calculate the previous two price reductions, then the total benefits obtained by the people in three years will reach 274 billion rubles. Therefore, the actual wages of the working people have greatly increased, the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble has increased, and as a result of all this, the production of consumer goods is expanding, and the volume of trade is increasing, all of which are improving the lives of our working people, making life better and more abundant. At the same time, the Soviet government's decision to revise the ruble's value with gold as its standard, making gold the most reliable foundation for the powerful Soviet currency, also provides convincing proof of our victory. The dollar standard has become unstable, and for us, it is no longer reliable and beneficial to determine the value of the ruble on the international market based on the dollar.

Great achievements have been made in post-war housing construction. In the four years of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, a total of 72 million square meters of urban housing have been built and restored, and 2.3 million houses have been built in rural areas. A large number of schools, hospitals, clubs, theaters, libraries, and other cultural institutions have also been built in cities and the countryside.

The example of Soviet Belarus can prove our great achievements in this regard.

In the post-war years, 450,000 houses and thousands of public and cultural buildings have been built in the collective farms of Soviet Belarus.

In Minsk, the capital of Belarus, a great deal of work has also been done in restoring and building apartments, industrial buildings, and cultural buildings.

One in Five People in the Soviet Union is Studying in Schools or Higher Education Institutions

The success in this area is enormous, but we should not be complacent because of this. Much work remains to be done. This requires extensive spontaneous efforts from the masses, local Soviets, and party organs in order to fully resolve this task in the shortest possible time. My personal opinion is that production based on local raw materials, such as the production of basic building materials like bricks and tiles, must be carried out on a large scale in each state and district. Our people should not rely on forest resources for construction. Forest resources in the western part of our country have been greatly damaged by the war. We must do everything we can to manufacture a large number of bricks and tiles, so that construction can proceed quickly, and the buildings built can be strong and reliable. Everything possible exists to do this, especially in your republic.

Comrades! In the post-war years, great achievements have been made in technology, science, culture, public education, and public health. In our country, almost one in five people is studying in ordinary schools and vocational schools or technical schools and higher education institutions. This is our greatest achievement. In the old days, only the most outstanding people would have dreamed of this, but in the Soviet land, in the Stalin era, this has become a reality. Literature and art, which are organically linked to the lives of our people, are successfully developing in all our union republics. Our literature, dramatic works, plays, films, and poems, using the method of socialist realism, truthfully and skillfully portray the lives and heroic work of the great Soviet people—the creators of communist society—at a high ideological level.

Our scientific cadre is increasing and strengthening day by day. Our scientists are working selflessly with our people—breaking down outdated traditions, exposing the pseudo-science of dying capitalism, and bringing true socialist knowledge and science to the masses.

The broad masses of the working people have cultivated from among themselves tens of thousands of pioneers, inventors, and rationalization advocates. They have enriched Soviet science with their new achievements in all aspects of industry and agriculture, allowing it to flourish and facilitating its further development.

No country in the world has such a close, creative friendship between scientific workers and workers in industry and agriculture as our country. It has become common for our Stakhanovite workers—the most advanced people in industry—to give speeches in research institutes and scientific research departments, and they receive advice from scientists. Their experience is studied, and the working people of the people's democratic countries also follow their example.

The recently announced government decision to award Stalin prizes to scientists and the most advanced people in industry and agriculture for outstanding work in science and invention provides a clear example of the success of science, the increasingly strengthened connection between theory and practice, and the party's and Comrade Stalin himself's new concern for the further development of our Soviet science and technology.

Soviet Science Solves the Secrets of Atomic Energy Ending Imperialist Atomic Blackmail

Along with other scientific achievements, Soviet science has solved the secrets of atomic energy (long applause), thereby ending the atomic blackmail of the imperialists, who originally intended to use it to intimidate the people of the countries of the socialist and democratic camp—the vanguard of the fighters for world peace. The Soviet Union has its own atomic bomb (long applause). Instigators of a new world war must helplessly stop their atomic blackmail diplomacy, because it has proven to be of no use (laughter, applause).

Comrades, our achievements in all aspects of socialist construction are great. However, the Communist Party and the great Stalin teach us never to be complacent with the achievements already made, and not to be satisfied with small successes.

Our people still have many things to do to ensure that our motherland does not fall into any dangerous situation, and to accelerate our advance towards communism.

When Comrade Stalin spoke at the election assembly in Moscow on February 9, 1946, he said regarding long-term plans: "We must pay attention to ensuring that our industry can produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil annually."

There is no doubt that these tasks set by the leader will be successfully completed under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin and under the guidance of the great Stalin (applause lasting a long time).

The Soviet People are Convinced of the Victory of Socialism Over Capitalism

We are living in an era of competition between two systems—socialism and capitalism. The Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great Stalin are confident that the victory of socialism over capitalism can be guaranteed (stormy applause lasting a long time).

Lenin and Stalin's instruction on the possible long-term coexistence of two systems—socialism and capitalism—consistently expresses the hope of the Soviet people to ensure peace and security for mankind and the continuous progress of material and cultural development.

Comrade Stalin wrote in his reply to Mr. Wallace's open letter in May 1948: "... The Soviet government believes that, although there are differences in economic systems and ideologies, the simultaneous existence of these two systems and the peaceful settlement of differences between the Soviet Union and the United States are not only possible but also absolutely necessary for world peace."

The Soviet foreign policy has always unswervingly followed these instructions of our leader.

If you pay attention to the position of our official representatives at the United Nations, at various conferences, and at foreign ministers' conferences, you will see in every occasion the firm and consistent position of our government to defend world peace and to oppose the reactionary forces and their financial and atomic diplomacy, and to oppose instigators of a new war.

The Capitalist World Inevitably Falls into an Extremely Serious Economic Crisis

While the Soviet Union is unswervingly embarking on the road of vigorous progress in all aspects of economic and cultural life, the capitalist world is inevitably falling into an extremely serious economic crisis.

In all capitalist countries, industrial production is declining, unemployment is increasing, consumer prices are constantly rising, the living standards of the working people are declining day by day, the impoverishment of the broad masses is continuing, and class contradictions are becoming increasingly acute.

In the United States, the level of industrial production in 1949 fell by 22 percent compared with 1940, and even according to incomplete official figures, 15 million people were unemployed. In other words, the number of unemployed people was as high as 30 percent of all industrial workers. In 1949, the living standards of American workers were reduced by 25 to 30 percent compared with pre-war levels. Despite the authors' marked tendency to embellish the capitalist economic situation, a report published by the United Nations Secretariat pointed out that in the United States in 1949, the number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed increased by 111 percent compared with 1948. In Western Europe and in the majority of countries in the Near East, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia, unemployment and living expenses are increasing. In India, 70 million agricultural workers work on average for only two or three months a year. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in capitalist countries has exceeded 40 million. Together with their families, nearly 150 million people. These figures show that the capitalist world has been unable to avoid economic crisis and eloquently prove the utter failure of the Marshall Plan, which has even further increased the scope of this crisis and disrupted the economies of Western Europe and other capitalist countries, which have been weakened to such an extent. Comrades! In this atmosphere, the theorists of old capitalism are trying to find a way out of the economic crisis in aggression and a new world war. In order to achieve this evil purpose, the most arrogant representatives of imperialist reaction are unscrupulous. The Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, the tens of billions of dollars in alms to bankrupt and subservient "rulers" such as Chiang Kai-shek, the revival of militarism and fascism in West Germany and Japan, the arms race, the atomic bomb, the Titoist spy agencies in the people's democratic countries, the absurd slanders against the socialist camp, and other despicable and dirty tricks—all of these have been brought out to save capitalism and to achieve world domination by Anglo-American imperialism.

But the advance of history is ruthless, and it has its own laws. After the First Imperialist War, as everyone knows, in October 1917, our people drove out the capitalists and landlords from one-sixth of the earth. Long before the Second World War, Comrade Stalin warned the imperialists who were planning a war against the Soviet Union at the 17th Party Congress: "If, after such a war, the bourgeois gentlemen lose a few governments that are close to them and that are now ruling peacefully by 'God's grace', then let them not complain to us." He also said: "It is almost without doubt that the Second World War against the Soviet Union will lead the aggressors to complete failure, will cause revolutions in some countries in Europe and Asia, and will destroy the bourgeois-landlord governments in those countries."

This is not a prediction, no. This is a Stalinist Marxist-Leninist forecast based on the knowledge of the laws of class struggle and social development.

Indeed, after the Second World War launched by Fascist Germany and Imperialist Japan with the obvious tacit consent of the reactionary forces of Britain, France and the United States, many bourgeois governments became vassals of the "wealthy" Uncle Sam of America.

The Results of the Second World War Fully Conform to Stalin's Scientific Predictions

The working people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania have become the complete masters of their countries. After the emperors and reactionary governments were driven out together with the landlords and capitalists, they are advancing very successfully and confidently under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the working class as their vanguard, along the road of socialist transformation of their countries.

The German people established the German Democratic Republic, and the great Chinese people, under the leadership of their leader Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, defeated the puppet of American imperialism—the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique. The national liberation struggle of the people of Asia and the Pacific against imperialist oppressors is growing. All this has greatly expanded the basis of the democratic anti-imperialist camp and strengthened the front of peace supporters and fighters for peace.

Comrades, these are the results of the Second World War. The actual development conforms exactly to the amazingly prescient predictions made by our leader and teacher, the great Stalin, at the 17th Party Congress in January 1934. If the imperialist gentlemen disregard all the obvious and convincing lessons of history and inflict a Third World War on humanity, there is no doubt that this war will end the dying existence of the decaying capitalist world (long applause).

The guarantee of this is the power of the great Soviet Union and the fraternal cooperation for peace, freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries advancing along the socialist road, along the democratic road. The guarantee of the final victory of the Lenin-Stalin cause is also our tested Communist Party, tempered in battle, and our leader and teacher Comrade Stalin—the great fighter for the happiness of the working people of the world (long applause).

Comrades! The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in its message to all voters, male and female workers and peasants, personnel of the Soviet Army and Navy, and Soviet intellectuals, calls on all our voters to fight for the further development and prosperity of socialist industry, the system of collective farms, and socialist agriculture, for the development of Soviet education, science, and culture, and for a happier, wealthier, and more cultured life for the Soviet people.

The Peoples of All Nationalities of the Soviet Union are Closely United Around Stalin Striving for the Victory of Communism

Our Party Central Committee urges us to consolidate the inviolable friendship of the great Soviet peoples, to develop the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, and to strengthen the front of peace, democracy, and socialism (long applause).

Our Party Central Committee calls on all of us to continue to strengthen the strength of the Soviet armed forces to defend the creative labor of the Soviet people, and the loyal sentinels on the inviolable borders of our socialist motherland (long applause). Long live our glorious and heroic Soviet army! (The audience stood up, and there was a storm of cheers and loud cheers to salute the Soviet armed forces). Comrades! In the same message, the Central Committee of the Party of Lenin and Stalin urges all voters in the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to unite more closely around our party, around Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, to strive for new labor achievements, for the further prosperity of our socialist motherland, and for the victory of communism in our country! (Long applause).

I am convinced that in order to accomplish these great and lofty tasks, the Soviet voters, who have been integrated into a united Stalinist force, will, as in previous elections, vote for the alliance of communists and non-communists in the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and vote for those they trust. To elect those who have never let them down and who will once again live up to the trust of socialist builders, to elect those who have been tested in the struggle for the great cause of Lenin and Stalin. (Great applause)

Comrades! Let me once again sincerely thank you for your trust in me, thank you for your trust in our Communist Party, and let me also integrate my love and your deep feelings for our great leader, teacher and friend Stalin (long applause). All attendees stood up).

Long live our great socialist motherland—the fortress and protector of peace for all progressive mankind! (Stormy applause)

Long live the powerful and invincible Soviet people! (Stormy applause)

Long live the glorious people of Soviet Belarus! (Stormy applause)

Celebrate the alliance of party and non-party in the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union! (Stormy applause)

Long live the great party of Lenin and Stalin! Glory belongs to our great leader and teacher Stalin! (Long and stormy applause, cheers. Cheers: "Glory belongs to the great Stalin", "Long live Comrade Voroshilov, a loyal comrade-in-arms of Comrade Stalin, our candidate"! "Cheers to our own Stalin, the best friend of the people of Belarus, hurrah!"). (End)

    同志们！苏联最高苏维埃选举日已经临近了。我们整个国家和我国全体强大而英勇的人民正在以非常巨大的热情总结着战后五年计划中过去四年的成绩，总结着这几年中他们在社会主义建设的和平阵线上所获得的造诣与成功的成绩。苏联人民以理应自豪的心情来看他们已经获得的不小的胜利，并以无限的热爱来表示他们对这些胜利的组织者与缔造者、对苏联人民和我国共产党的伟大领袖与导师斯大林的感激之情。（暴风雨般的掌声。与会者起立。欢呼：“光荣归于伟大的斯大林！”“斯大林同志万岁！”）
  社会主义国家正以巨人的步伐向共产主义前进
    我们生活与工作在斯大林时代的人们有着无比的好运。各时代最伟大的天才马克思和恩格斯，在上一世纪中叶已为人类开辟并指出了使人类从资本主义的奴役和压迫下获得解放的大道。继承马克思和恩格斯事业的天才——列宁与斯大林——把马克思主义的伟大学说变为活生生的现实，动员了我国各族人民，在地球六分之一的土地上从事于社会主义新社会的伟大建设。
    而现在，这个新的、前所未见的社会主义国家，已经过去三十二年了，它在生活、发展，并且正在以巨人的步伐向它发展中的下一阶段——共产主义前进。目前我们正处在人类的伟大天才我们的列宁逝世后的第二十七个年头里。这是第二十七个年头，我们伟大的列宁与斯大林的党和我们强大的社会主义国家一直在无愧于马克思、恩格斯和列宁的继承人、伟大的斯大林领导下，越过了它们途中的一切障碍，沿着它们光荣的道路，从胜利奔向胜利。（掌声）
    在从历史上说来是这样短暂的一段时间之内，我们的国家已因其子女们的意志和努力，并在布尔什维克党的领导下，在共产主义的伟大领袖列宁与斯大林卓越的指导之下，从落后的、封建的资本主义国家变成强大的、多民族的、统一的、社会主义国家，具有世界上最先进的社会与国家制度。
    九年以前，执行着德国帝国主义的意志并且在短时间内轻而易举地决定了当时欧洲命运的德国法西斯主义，曾决定用武力来摧毁苏联人民的果实，摧毁社会主义国家并奴役其人民。这种血腥的冒险，其结局是帝国主义强盗们的全部惨败和苏联人民的胜利——人类历史上最伟大的胜利。
    在伟大的爱国战争中，在列宁和斯大林党的领导下，在天才的统帅斯大林的最高指挥下，我国人民在艰苦的斗争中保卫了我国的独立，并从法西斯野蛮统治之下拯救了全世界各族人民。（鼓掌声）
    斯大林同志在向我党第十七次代表大会的报告中所作的预言已经完全实现了，他说：“我们是主张和平并拥护和平事业的。可是，我们并不害怕威胁，并且准备用打击去回答战争挑拨者的打击。谁愿意和平并力求与我们发生事务联系，谁就总会得到我们的赞助。而那些敢于侵犯我国的人，就会受到粉碎性的还击，教训他们以后再也不敢把他们的猪鼻子，伸到我们苏维埃的花园里来。”（全场振奋。经久不息的鼓掌）
    苏维埃“花园”——我们热爱的祖国——今天百花在继续绚烂地、幸运地盛开着。在旁边，新的“花园”——各人民民主国家里也在百花怒放。（全场振奋，鼓掌）然而不顾警告，猪鼻子并没有在这世界上灭绝，并且甚至远隔重洋还常常可以听到它们恶意的嗥叫声。（全场大笑）
  苏联与对苏友好兄弟民族有着绵长的共同边疆
    同志们！由于苏联人民战胜德国法西斯主义和日本帝国主义的划时代胜利的结果，我们的社会主义祖国已屹然矗立在从太古之时起的历史性的边境之上了。
    曾经长时间被分割的西乌克兰、白俄罗斯和摩尔达维亚人民，终于已经在他们自己的乡土上结合成为统一的不可摧毁的家庭。
    在北方，新的边境为列宁格勒提供了可靠的屏障。
    在东方，苏联的千岛群岛和南库页岛拱卫着我们的远东。
    东普鲁士——德意志普鲁士侵略性的容克制度的蜂巢和古老的基地，对于我们祖国领土的侵略就是在这里酝酿和形成的——现在已不复存在了。
    我们的社会主义祖国在它的历史上第一次，与对我国友好的兄弟民族有着绵长的共同边境。在西方，从波罗的海到黑海，我们的邻邦是自由与爱好和平的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚人民。那些坚定地走上了社会主义改造的道路的国家里的人民，是以永恒的兄弟般的友谊和我们伟大祖国的人民团结在一起。
    我们祖国的东部边疆，和对我们友好的国家——伟大的中华人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国——相接壤。
    这些成就的政治的和国际的重要性很不小。这些是我们英勇的人民在列宁、斯大林党的领导下获得的。这些成就的鼓舞者和组织者是我们的导师和领袖斯大林。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！我们人民所从事的反对德国法西斯侵略者和日本帝国主义者的斗争之这一历史上最伟大的事件，我们的记忆犹新，姑且不去回忆那些已经过去的惨淡的岁月吧。首先抵抗德国法西斯匪徒的背信弃义的突击的白俄罗斯和乌克兰人民，特别清楚这次战争给他们共和国及全苏联以何等重大的损害。
    但尽管我们有过巨大的牺牲，我们今日仍然目睹国民经济恢复及其进一步提高与增长的异常巨大的成就。
    一九四六年二月在莫斯科的斯大林选区选举大会上发表演说时，斯大林同志对将来的计划曾这样说：“新五年计划的主要任务是恢复我国被破坏的区域，把工业与农业的生产恢复到战前水平，并进而在或多或少相当大的程度上超过那个水平”。同志们：斯大林同志的明智，从我们领袖的这些话中已经体现出来了。没有人能像斯大林那样的了解他的人民，他相信他们的伟大力量，并且毫不怀疑人民能够经得住人类历史空前未有的战争，能从战争中一跃而为胜利者，这些人民在面对沉重的战后困难时绝不畏缩，而是克服这些困难，并沿着社会主义建设中的崭新成就的大路更向前迈进。
    在今天，同志们，对于履行战后斯大林五年计划的成果，我们能够用非常满意的情绪来总结它们，这些成果是由我国的工人阶级、集体农民与知识分子经过紧张的创造性劳动而获致的。
    在一九四九年年底的时候，苏联工业的总产量已超过了五年计划为一九五○年所规定的水平。一九四九年整个社会主义工业的总产量已超过战前一九四○年产量的百分之四十一。若就一大批工业品来说，这个百分比还要高。
    在战后五年计划的头四年里，苏联工业每年增加产量达百分之二十以上。劳动生产率已经上升，生产成本降低，而产品的质量已经改善。在这四年里，已恢复或重新建筑了五千二百个工业企业，并且都已动工生产了。
    战后时期社会主义耕作也表现了同样宏大的成就。由于集体农场农民们忘我的努力，由于党、政府以及斯大林同志本人经常注意社会主义农业，尤其是农业中集体农场与国营农场在技术上、装备上与组织上的巩固，我们才能在短时期内解决了谷物问题。去年，谷物收成总计为七十六亿普特。因此，大大地超过了一九四○年谷物的总收成，同时也几乎达到五年计划为一九五○年所规定的标准。谷物方面的节省使集体与国营农场能在发展牲畜业方面发生决定性的转变，结果一九四九年公有的集体农场牲畜头数超过了战前一九四○年的水平。毫无问题，我们党与政府所订定的发展集体与国营农场公有牲畜饲养的三年计划，定能准时全部完成。
    为了要保证年年丰收，已在造林方面举办了伟大的工程。
    社会主义农业技术的装备正以很快的速度发展着。仅在一九四九年中，集体与国营农场所得到的拖拉机、汽车与农业机器，就为一九四○年的三倍至四倍。
    社会主义集体农场财产与集体农民福利与文化程度的不断提高，是党、苏维埃政府以及我们伟大领袖斯大林同志所经常关心的事。（鼓掌）
  白俄罗斯的城市与集体农场已恢复得几乎像新的一样
    曾被德国法西斯侵略者所占领过的区域里，工业、农业及文化的复兴与进一步的发展，也正以全速向前迈进。
    就拿苏维埃白俄罗斯作为例子，我们可以看到苏联人民的劳动英雄精神是如何伟大，可以看到昨天曾为战场上英雄的人们及全体劳动人民的意志是如何强大与不可摧毁，这些人已使企业、城市与集体农场恢复得几乎像新的一样。
    一九四六年，我看到了卑鄙的敌人对于白俄罗斯首都做了些什么。散布在各处的废墟和半毁的建筑物，就是在敌人被逐出后，明斯克所剩下的一切。
    今天，到处都可以看到白俄罗斯人民四年来巨大努力的惊人结果。这证实了社会主义国家的力量，我们的社会制度的力量。
    战后的年代里，白俄罗斯人民在恢复和发展工业、农业、文化和科学方面，取得了重大的成就。
    白俄罗斯共和国的工业，在许多种出品方面，已经大大地超过了战前的水平。例如在泥炭、水泥、砖、纺织品、食品、肉类、乳品和其他一些工业方面，就都是这样。整个地说来，白俄罗斯的各地方工业和共和国一级的工业的水平，可以确保在一九五○年超过五年计划。
    在白俄罗斯，播种了各种农作物的农地面积，已经接近战前。而各种最重要的农作物的收获量，则已达到战前一九四○年的水平。
    在目前开办着的学校和高等教育机关的数目，以及各级学生的人数方面，白俄罗斯已经超过了战前水平。
    同志们！在白俄罗斯遭到战争的巨大破坏以后，只有在我们的社会主义社会的条件下，而且只有在布尔什维克党和英明斯大林的领导下，才能在这样短的时间里医好战争的创伤，抹去纳粹占领的血迹。
    在社会主义经济稳步前进和发展的基础上，生活标准在不断提高，全体苏联人民的福利和文化水平在不断上升。
  苏联劳动人民的生活愈来愈丰足
    三年来，粮食和制成品的价格曾经三度削减。由于国营零售价格的减低，仅在今年一年内，人民所得的利益估计将达一千一百亿卢布，如果再计算到前两次的降低物价，那末人民在三年中的所得的全部利益将达二千七百四十亿卢布。因此，劳动人民的实际工资是大大增加了，苏联卢布的购买力提高了，由于这一切的结果，消费品的生产正在扩大，贸易额日益增大，这一切改善了我国劳动人民的生活，使生活更好更丰足。与此同时，苏维埃政府决定以黄金作本位改订卢布币值，使黄金成为强大的苏联通货的最可靠的基础，这决议也为我们的胜利提供了令人信服的证明。美元本位已变成不稳定的了，对我们说，再在国际市场上根据美元来定卢布的价值已经是不可靠和不利的了。
    战后房屋建筑已有很大的成就。在战后斯大林五年计划的四年间，共建筑和恢复了七千二百万平方公尺的城市住宅，在农村区建筑了两百三十万幢住房。城市和乡间还建筑了大量的学校、医院、俱乐部、戏院、图书馆及其他文化机关。
    苏维埃白俄罗斯的例子可以证明我们在这方面的伟大成就。
    战后年月里，在苏维埃白俄罗斯的集体农场中建筑了四十五万幢房屋及数千所公共及文化建筑物。
    在白俄罗斯首都明斯克，在恢复及建筑公寓、工业建筑物及文化建筑物上，也做了很多的工作。
  在苏联五个人中就有一个人在学校或高级学院里读书
    这方面的成功是巨大的，但我们不应因此而自满，许多工作尚待去做。这要求群众、地方苏维埃及党的机关作广泛的自发努力，以求充分地和在最短时期内解决这一任务。我个人的意见认为，以当地原料为基础的生产，如像基本建筑材料砖瓦的生产，必须在各州和各区大规模进行。我们人民不应把建筑依靠在森林富源上，我国西部的森林富源已受到战争的巨大破坏。我们必须尽力之所能制造大量的砖瓦，这样建筑才能迅速进行，建筑起来的建筑物才能牢固可靠。有一切可能可以这样做，尤其是在你们的共和国里。
    同志们！在战后年月里，技术、科学、文化、公众教育和公共卫生方面已经取得了伟大的成就。在我国，差不多每五个人中间就有一个人在普通学校和职业学校或技术学校和高级学院里学习。这是我们最伟大的成就。在旧时代，只有思想最优良的人们才会梦想到这个，而在苏维埃国土上，在斯大林时代里，这却已成为现实了。与我们人民的生活有机地联系着的文学和艺术，正在我们的一切加盟共和国中成功地发展着。我们的文学、戏曲著作、戏剧、电影和诗，用社会主义现实主义的方法，在高度的思想水平上真实而又巧妙地刻画出伟大苏联人民——共产主义社会的缔造者——的生活和英雄的工作。
    我们的科学干部正在日益增多，日益加强。我们的科学家正在和我国人民一起忘我地工作着——打破了陈旧过时的传统，揭露了垂死的资本主义的伪科学，并正在给群众带来真正的社会主义知识和科学。
    广大的劳动人民群众从他们自身当中培养出成千成万的开路先锋、发明家和合理化倡导者。他们用他们在工农业各方面的新成就丰富了苏联科学，使之开花结果并便利于它的进一步发展。
    世界上没有一个国家像我国那样，科学工作者和工农业中的工作者之间，有着那样密切的、富有创造性的友谊。这已成为常见的事：我们的斯塔哈诺夫式工人——工业中最先进的人——在研究所和科学研究部门中发表演说，他们得到科学家们的建议，他们的经验得到研究，人民民主国家的劳动人民也遵循他们的榜样。
    最近发表的政府关于把奖励科学和发明方面卓越工作的斯大林奖金颁发给科学家和工农业中最先进的人们的决定，提供了清晰的例子，证明科学的成功，证明理论与实践之间日益增强的联系，以及党和斯大林同志本人对于进一步发扬我们苏联科学与技术的新的关怀。
  苏联科学解决原子能秘密从而结束了帝国主义的原子讹诈
    伴同着其它科学成就，苏联科学解决了原子能的秘密（长时间鼓掌），从而结束了帝国主义者的原子讹诈，而他们原打算借此恫吓社会主义与民主阵营的各国人民——争取全世界和平斗士的先锋。苏联有自己的原子弹。（长时间鼓掌）新世界战争的挑拨者必须无可奈何地停止他们的原子讹诈外交政策，因为它已证明是毫无好处的。（笑声，掌声）
    同志们，我们在社会主义建设一切方面的成就是伟大的。但是，共产党和伟大的斯大林教导我们绝不要对于已经达到的成就引为自满，不要安于小成。
    我国人民还有许多事情要做，以保证我们祖国不致陷入任何危急境地，而加速我们向共产主义的前进。
    一九四六年二月九日斯大林同志在莫斯科的选举大会上演说讲到长期的计划时说：“我们必须要注意使我国的工业每年能够生产五千万吨的生铁，六千万吨的钢，五亿吨的煤，六千万吨的石油。”
    无疑的，领袖所规定的这些任务，将要在列宁和斯大林党的领导下，在伟大的斯大林的指导下，顺利地完成。（掌声历久不绝）
  苏联人民确信社会主义对资本主义的胜利
    我们正生活在两种制度——社会主义和资本主义——竞争的时代。共产党和伟大的斯大林领导下的苏联人民，确信社会主义对资本主义的胜利是能够得到保证的。（暴风雨般的历久不绝的掌声）
    列宁和斯大林关于两种制度——社会主义与资本主义——可能长期并存的训示，一贯地表达了苏联人民要确保人类和平与安全以及物质与文化的不断进步的希望。
    斯大林同志在一九四八年五月答复华莱士先生的公开信中这样写道：“……苏联政府相信，虽然在经济制度与思想上有分歧，但为了世界和平，这两种制度的同时存在以及苏联与美国间分歧意见的和平解决，不仅是可能的，而且也是绝对必要的。”
    苏联外交政策始终不变地遵循着我们领袖的这些训示。
    假使你留意我们驻联合国的、在各种的会议上和外长会议上的正式代表的立场的话，任何场合你都会看到我们政府为保卫世界和平及反对反动势力及其金元和原子外交以及反对新战争挑拨者而斗争的坚定的和始终一贯的立场。
  资本主义世界无可避免陷入极端严重的经济危机
    当苏联在经济文化生活各方面坚定不移地走上轰轰烈烈的进步的道路的时候，资本主义世界却无可避免地陷入极端严重的经济危机。
    在所有的资本主义国度里，工业生产量正在下降，失业人数正在增加，消费品价格不断高涨，劳动人民的生活水准日益下降，广大群众的贫穷化正在继续，阶级矛盾正在日益尖锐化。
    在美国，一九四九年工业生产水平与一九四○年相较下降百分之二十二，甚至根据不完全的官方数字也有一千五百万人失业，换句话说，失业人数多至全体产业工人的百分之三十。在一九四九年，美国工人生活标准较战前降低了百分之二十五至三十。尽管作者们有润色资本主义经济状况的显著倾向，联合国秘书处所发表的报告指出了：在美国，在一九四九年，完全失业与部分失业的数目，和一九四八年比较，增长了百分之一百一十一。在西欧和在近东、中东、拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲、与澳大利亚的多数国家，失业和生活费用都正在增长中。在印度，七千万农业工人每年工作平均只有两个月或者三个月。资本主义国家失业和半失业者已超过四千万。连同他们的家庭在一起，将近一亿五千万人。这些数字表明：资本主义世界已经不能避免经济危机，并且雄辩地证明马歇尔计划的彻底失败，这个计划甚至进一步增大这个危机的范围，并且使已经衰弱到现在这样的西欧和其他资本主义国家的经济陷于紊乱。同志们！在这个气氛之下，老朽的资本主义的理论家们正在企图在侵略和新的世界战争中寻找摆脱经济危机的道路。为了完成这个罪恶的目的，帝国主义反动派的最狂妄的代表们是不择手段的。马歇尔计划，北大西洋公约，对于破了产的仆从般的“统治者们”如蒋介石的几十亿美元的布施，军国主义与法西斯主义在西德和日本的复活，军备竞赛，原子弹，在人民民主国家的铁托分子间谍机关，对社会主义阵营的荒诞的诽谤和其他卑鄙龌龊的诡计——这一切都已被搬出来用以挽救资本主义并且实现英美帝国主义的世界统治。
    但是历史的前进是无情的，它有它自己的规律。在第一次帝国主义大战后，大家知道，在一九一七年十月我国人民从地球六分之一的土地上赶走了资本家和地主。在第二次世界大战前很久，斯大林同志在党第十七次代表大会上警告正在策划对苏联作战计划的帝国主义者说：“如果在这样一个战争以后第一天，资产阶级老爷们就会失去几个与他们亲近而现在“叨天保佑”平安统治着的政府，那就请他们不要来埋怨我们吧。”还说：“这几乎是毫无疑问地，反对苏联的第二次大战将使侵略者们走向完全的失败，将引起欧亚两洲若干国家的革命和那些国家中资产阶级——地主政府的毁灭。”
    这不是预言，不是的。这是根据对于阶级斗争与社会发展规律知识所作的斯大林主义的马克思——列宁主义的预见。
    真的，在法西斯德国与帝国主义日本在英法与美国反动势力的显然默许之下发动的第二次世界大战之后，很多资产阶级政府变成了“富有的”美国山姆大叔的附庸。
  第二次世界大战的结果完全符合斯大林科学的预见
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，已经变成了他们国家的完全主人。在把帝王与反动政府连同地主与资本家们一起被驱逐以后，他们正在极为成功地并满怀信心地以工人阶级为其先锋，在共产党的领导下沿着他们国家社会主义改造的道路前进。
    德国人民建立了德意志民主共和国，伟大的中国人民在他们的领袖毛泽东和中国共产党领导之下战胜了美国帝国主义的傀儡——国民党蒋介石集团，亚洲与太平洋人民反对帝国主义压迫者的民族解放斗争增长着，所有这一切，都大为扩大了民主反帝阵营的基础，加强了和平拥护者与争取和平的斗士的阵线。
    同志们，这些就是第二次世界大战的结果。实际的发展毫厘不爽地符合我们的领袖与导师伟大的斯大林在一九三四年一月第十七次党代表大会上所作的惊人远见的预言。如果帝国主义者先生们不管一切明显而令人信服的历史教训，把第三次世界大战加诸人类，毫无疑问，这一次大战将结束衰老的资本主义世界的垂死存在。（长久的暴风雨般的掌声）
    这一点的保证，就是伟大苏联的威力和沿着社会主义道路，沿着民主的道路前进的各国人民为了和平、自由与独立的兄弟般的合作。列宁斯大林事业的最后胜利的保证，还有我们在战斗中受到锻炼与久经考验的共产党和我们的领袖与导师斯大林同志——为全世界劳动人民谋幸福的伟大战士。（长久的暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    同志们！苏联共产党中央委员会在其给一切选民，男女工人与农民，苏联陆海军人员，苏联知识分子的文告中，号召我国的一切选民，为社会主义工业、集体农场制度与社会主义农业的进一步发展和昌盛，为苏联教育、科学和文化的发展，为苏联人民更幸福、更富裕和更有文化的生活而战斗。
  苏联各族人民紧密团结在斯大林周围争取共产主义的胜利
    我们党的中央委员会敦促我们巩固伟大苏联各族人民的不可侵犯的友谊，发展苏联人民的精神上和政治上的团结，加强和平、民主和社会主义阵线。（长时间鼓掌）
    我党中央委员会号召我们全体继续加强苏联武装部队保卫苏联人民的创造性劳动，和我们社会主义祖国不可侵犯的边疆上的忠实哨兵——的实力（长时间鼓掌）。我们光荣的英雄的苏联军队万岁！（全场起立，向苏联武装部队致敬的暴风雨般的欢呼声和响亮的乌拉声）同志们！在同一文告中，列宁、斯大林党中央委员会敦促一切选民，在即将到来的苏联最高苏维埃选举中，更紧密地团结在我们党的周围，团结在苏联各族人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志的周围，争取新的劳动伟绩，争取我们社会主义祖国进一步的繁荣，争取共产主义在我国的胜利！（暴风雨般的长时间鼓掌）。
    我确信，为了完成这些伟大崇高的任务，已经溶成一支统一的斯大林主义的队伍的苏维埃选民们，在即将到来的苏联最高苏维埃选举时，正如以前的选举一样，将投票选举共产党和非党联盟，选举他们所信赖的人，选举那些从未辜负他们而现在将再度无负社会主义建设者的信托的人，选举那些在为列宁与斯大林的伟大事业的斗争中受过考验的人。（大鼓掌）
    同志们！让我再次诚恳地感谢你们对我的信赖，感谢你们对我们共产党的信任，让我也把我对我们伟大领袖、导师和朋友斯大林的敬爱和你们的深厚的感情溶合起来吧（长久的暴风雨般的鼓掌。出席者全体起立）。
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国——一切进步人类的和平的堡垒与卫护者万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    强大的不可征服的苏维埃人民万岁！（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    苏维埃白俄罗斯的光荣的人民万岁！（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    庆祝在即将到来的苏联最高苏维埃选举中的党与非党联盟！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    伟大的列宁与斯大林的党万岁！光荣属于我们的伟大的领袖与导师斯大林！（长时的暴风雨般的掌声，欢呼声。欢呼：“光荣属于伟大的斯大林”，“斯大林同志的忠实战友，我们的候选人伏罗希洛夫万岁”！“为白俄罗斯人民的最好的朋友，我们自己的斯大林欢呼，乌拉！”）。（完）
