Xinhua News Agency, March 19th - The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League today issued "Instructions on Rural Youth Leagues Implementing the Ministry of Agriculture's 1950 Agricultural Production Policy and Grain and Cotton Production Increase Plan." The full text of the instructions is as follows:

The Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture's instructions regarding the 1950 agricultural production policy and grain and cotton production increase plan have been approved by the Government Administration Council. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has fully agreed and notified Party committees at all levels to lead all rural Party members to strive to complete it. Youth League committees at all levels must lead all rural Youth League organizations, unite the broad masses of young people, and, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, strive to complete the national agricultural production tasks determined in the instructions. This is also the central task for rural Youth League members to implement throughout the year. We ask you to pay attention to the following points:

The Most Important Task Now: Do a Good Job in Spring Ploughing

I. Spring has arrived. To complete the agricultural production plan stipulated by the state for 1950, first, Youth League committees at all levels should effectively and urgently seize the time to mobilize all young farmers to invest the greatest strength in the spring ploughing and sowing movement. Striving to do a good job in the first spring ploughing after liberation is the primary task of the rural Youth League.

II. Based on the specific plans for agricultural production determined by governments and the Communist Party at all levels, conduct research and discussions, and formulate practical plans for the Youth League's participation in agricultural production. The League's study tasks and all other League activities must be closely centered around production and serve production. Use all learning tools and methods to strengthen publicity and education on production policies, and constantly improve the labor enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of young people, so that young people become conscious agricultural producers. Leading organs must conduct in-depth supervision and inspection and periodic summaries to continuously improve and enhance work.

III. Youth League branches should be good at organizing the broad masses of young farmers to carry out mutual aid and cooperative production with adults, and help families and individuals make production plans. League members should lead the masses with their exemplary actions and patient persuasion, and prevent the practice of separating from families, separating from the masses, and young people doing things in isolation (youth mutual aid organizations that have already been organized should be helped and improved according to the actual situation, rather than simply ordering them to disband). Only when accepting certain new production tasks or promoting new agricultural scientific methods, due to the conservatism and unfamiliarity of general farmers, who express doubt or even rejection, can the Youth League organization lead young people to first set an example, and then gradually promote it among the masses.

Learn Agricultural Production Knowledge, Lead Youth Competition Movement

IV. Strengthen the study of agricultural production knowledge, advocate learning advanced farming methods, and give play to the creativity of young people in production. On the one hand, it is necessary to learn the scientific production experience accumulated in rural areas for many years, which requires learning from all experienced farmers; on the other hand, it is also necessary to learn new agricultural scientific methods, which requires learning from superiors, farms, agricultural experts, technicians, etc. Without production knowledge and production experience, it is impossible to give play to the creativity of young people in production.

V. All female League members must actively participate in agricultural production (including sideline occupations), especially in places where women generally do not have the habit of production, the exemplary leading role of female League members is even more important. The way to lead women to participate in production should be to rely on the influence of the practical actions of female League members and patient publicity and persuasion. If relying on forced orders, it will not succeed.

VI. Leading young people to invest in mass production competitions, comparing crops, comparing harvests, and democratically selecting models is one of the excellent ways to improve young people's labor enthusiasm and production results. Under the conditions stipulated by the entire production competition, we can promote specific competition conditions between young people and between mutual aid groups to carry out a heated mass production movement. Youth labor heroes and production models must be meaningful only if they are selected and recognized by the masses. In some places, the Youth League is used as a unit to compete with non-League youth, adults, the elderly, or other groups, and even with the Communist Party organizations to challenge them. This approach is incorrect, because doing so easily separates young people from their families and from the masses.

VII. It is necessary to carry out the work of establishing, consolidating, and strengthening the Youth League organization in the production movement. Every step of the League building work should be combined with the restoration and development of production. The practice of building the League in isolation from the production movement is wrong and therefore unacceptable.

### 青年团中央指示农村青年团保证贯彻棉粮增产计划  号召团结广大青年努力奋斗

　　青年团中央指示农村青年团保证贯彻棉粮增产计划
    号召团结广大青年努力奋斗
    【新华社十九日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会今日发出“关于农村青年团贯彻执行农业部一九五○年农业生产方针及粮棉增产计划的指示”，指示全文如下：
    中央人民政府农业部关于一九五○年农业生产方针及粮棉增产计划的指示，业经政务院批准。中共中央已完全同意，并通知各级党委，领导全体农村党员努力地予以完成。青年团各级团委必须领导所有农村青年团的组织，团结广大青年，在各级党委的领导下，为完成指示中所确定的全国农业生产任务而奋斗，这也就是农村青年团员贯彻全年的中心任务。我们要求你们注意下列几点：
  当前第一要务  做好春耕工作
    一、春季已到，为完成一九五○年国家所规定的农业生产计划，首先各级团委应该有效地紧张地抓紧时间，动员全体农民青年，以最大的力量投入春耕播种运动中去；努力做好解放后第一个春耕工作，是当前农村青年团的第一要务。
    二、根据各级人民政府和共产党所确定的关于农业生产的具体计划，进行研究讨论，并规定出青年团参加农业生产的切合实际的计划来。团的学习任务和团的一切其他活动，必须紧紧的围绕生产并服务于生产去进行。利用一切学习工具和学习方法，加强关于生产政策的宣传教育工作，不断地提高广大青年的劳动热忱和生产积极性，使青年成为自觉的农业生产者。领导机关必须进行深入的督促检查和定期的总结，使工作不断改进和提高。
    三、青年团支部要善于组织广大青年农民和成年人一道去进行变工互助合作生产，帮助家庭作生产计划及个人作生产计划。团员要以自己的模范行动和耐心的宣传说服工作去带动群众，防止脱离家庭，脱离群众，只是年青人孤立地单独搞一套的做法（对已经组织起来的青年变工组织，应根据实际情况予以帮助和改进，而不是简单命令其解散）。只有在接受某些新的生产任务或推广新的农业科学办法时，由于一般农民的守旧与不习惯，尚表示怀疑甚至拒绝的情况下，青年团组织可以领导青年首先做出榜样，再在群众中逐渐推广。
  学习农业生产知识  领导青年竞赛运动
    四、加强学习农业生产知识，提倡学习进步的农作方法，发挥青年在生产中的创造性。一方面需要学习农村中多年积累的合乎科学的生产经验，这就必须向一切有经验的农民学习；另一方面还需要学习新的农业科学方法，这就必须向上级及农场、农业家、技术等学习。没有生产知识和生产经验，就不可能发挥青年在生产中的创造性。
    五、所有女团员必须积极参加农业生产（包括副业），特别在一般妇女尚无生产习惯的地方，女团员的模范带头作用，就更为重要。带动一般妇女参加生产的办法，应该是依靠女团员的实际行动的影响和耐心的宣传说服工作，如果依靠强制命令，那是不会成功的。
    六、领导青年投入群众性的生产竞赛运动中去，进行比庄稼，比收成，民主的评选模范，这是提高青年劳动热忱与生产成绩的优良办法之一。在整个生产竞赛所规定的条件下边，可提倡青年与青年之间，互助组与互助组之间，规定具体竞赛条件，开展热烈的群众性的生产运动。青年劳动英雄与生产模范，必须是群众所评选与承认的才有意义。某些地方以青年团为单位，去与团外青年、成年、老年、或其他团体，甚至与共产党的组织进行竞赛，向他们挑战，这种做法是不正确的，因为这样做容易使青年脱离家庭，脱离群众。
    七、必须在生产运动中进行建立、巩固与壮大青年团组织的工作。建团工作的每一步骤，均应与恢复和发展生产相结合，脱离生产运动孤立建团的做法是错误的，因而也是不能容许的。  ??
