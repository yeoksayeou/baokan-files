Inquiry and Reply

　　To Comrade Jue Pingjun regarding divorce and land distribution:
    The following are suggested solutions to your inquiries regarding divorce and land distribution:

    I. If the woman, due to differing times of marriage and land reform, has not been allocated land in either her parents' home or her husband's home, she can request the local government and farmers' association to make appropriate adjustments if there is still public land in the village.

    II. Property jointly acquired by husband and wife during their married life (the woman's management of household affairs and raising of children should be regarded as the same in nature as the man's productive labor) constitutes the joint property of the husband and wife. Upon divorce, the woman is entitled to her share of this property. If the woman has not been allocated land in either her parents' or her husband's home, she should not demand a share of the man's pre-marital land (land allocated during land reform based on family population) as joint property upon divorce. However, if the woman does not remarry after the divorce and faces financial difficulties, the man should assist her in maintaining her livelihood. The method and duration of assistance can be agreed upon by both parties or determined by the People's Court.

专栏：询问与答复

　　离婚和分地决平君：
    所询夫妇离婚和分地问题，提供处理意见如下：
    一、女方因结婚及土改时间的先后不同，在娘家和夫家两头均未分得土地者，如村中尚有公地，可请求当地政府和农会酌予调剂。
    二、夫妻生活中共同劳动所得之财产（女的管理家务，抚育小孩，应视为与男的生产劳动同一性质），为夫妻共同财产。离婚时，女方可从这份财产中分得自己应得的一份。如女的在娘家和夫家并未分得土地，离婚时则不应将男方婚前原有土地（土改时按家庭人口分到的地），作为夫妻共同财产而提出分地要求。但如果女方在离婚后未再结婚而生活困难者，男方应帮助其维持生活。帮助的办法和期限，可由双方协议或由人民法院判定。
