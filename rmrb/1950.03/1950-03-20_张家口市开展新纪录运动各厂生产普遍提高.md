　　Zhangjiakou City Launches New Record Movement, Production Universally Improved in All Factories

　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The movement to create new production records in Zhangjiakou City has been underway for two months. With the active efforts of all workers, the production level of all state-owned factories has generally improved. The beginning of the movement focused on production and economy, and then developed into improving technology and creating inventions to increase production and reduce costs. According to a survey of fourteen state-owned factories: For example, the alcohol factory originally planned to produce 27,000 jin of alcohol in January, reducing costs by 5%. Due to the increase in productivity, the result was 11.34% over the original plan, and the cost was reduced by 15.85%. The cigarette factory produced 2,561 boxes of cigarettes in January, exceeding the plan by 331 boxes. Greater achievements were made in reducing waste. Taking the cigarette rolling room as an example, the average paper loss rate from August to December last year was 4.26%, and the cigarette waste was 0.706%. According to statistics from January 12th to 15th, the paper loss rate has been reduced to 1.467%, and the waste has dropped to 0.12%. These two items alone can save 15,274 jin of millet every month, equivalent to 98% of the two-month salary of 30 workers in the cigarette rolling room. The vegetable oil factory, because it accepted workers' rationalization proposals and improved its technology, produced 104,230 jin of oil in January, exceeding the original plan by 8.21%. The oil yield rate increased from 27.3% to 28.9%, and the quality exceeded the specified export standards, reducing costs equivalent to 39,000 jin of millet. In addition, factories such as clothing, rubber, leather, and flour mills have made significant achievements in improving production efficiency and product quality.

　　The above achievements were first obtained because, after a year of restoration work, the workers' awareness has been considerably improved. At present, more than 90% of the city's employees have joined the trade union, and branches of the Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League have been established in factories with more than 30 people. Under the education and leadership of the Party, the League, and the trade union, advanced workers have begun to establish a new attitude towards labor and actively produce. (2) The Party, government, and trade union have established the leading ideology of production first. At the end of last year, the Municipal Party Committee conducted a review of the year's work, conveyed the North China Bureau's 1950 production instructions and the resolutions of the Chahar Provincial Party Committee. The Provincial Department of Industry and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have successively held meetings, repeatedly emphasizing that the primary task of the Party, government, and trade union is to lead production. (3) Preliminary democratization of management has been realized. In the new record movement, the tendency of the factory management committee to be merely a formality was overcome. A large number of model workers and production activists were absorbed to participate in factory management, which improved the responsibility and enthusiasm of workers to participate in factory management. At the same time, under the leadership of the trade union and the guarantee of the Party and the League, the trade union branches or workshop teams and individuals have all formulated production plans, which made the production plans formulated by the administration into the conscious actions of the masses, making the realization of production tasks a reliable guarantee.

　　张家口市开展新纪录运动各厂生产普遍提高
    【本报讯】张家口市开展创造生产新纪录运动已将两月，在全体职工积极努力下，各公营工厂生产水平普遍提高。运动的开始是以生产节约为中心，随之即发展到改进技术与创造发明，以提高生产降低成本。据十四个公营工厂调查：如酒精厂原计划一月份产酒精二七、○○○斤，降低成本百分之五，由于生产率的提高，结果较原计划超产百分之一一·三四，成本则降低百分之一五·八五。纸烟厂一月份生产纸烟二、五六一箱，超过计划三三一箱；在减少浪费方面则成绩更大，以卷烟室为例，去年八至十二月盘纸损失率平均为百分之四·二六，烟支废品为百分之○·七○六。而据一月十二至十五三天统计，盘纸损失率已减至百分之一·四六七，废品降至百分之○·一二。仅此两项，合计每月可节省一五、二七四斤小米，相当于卷烟室三十个工人两个月工资的百分之九八。植物油厂因为接受了工人合理化建议，改进了技术，一月份产油一○四、二三○斤，超过原计划百分之八·二一，出油率由百分之二七·三提高到二八·九，且质量超过规定出口之标准，减低成本折合小米三九、○○○斤。此外如被服、橡胶、制革、面粉等厂在提高生产效率与产品质量方面，都有显著的成绩。
    以上成绩的获得，首先是因为各厂经过一年来的恢复工作，工人觉悟已相当提高。目前，全市已有百分之九十以上职工加入了职工会，三十个人以上的工厂都已建立了共产党和新民主主义青年团的支部。先进工人在党、团和工会的教育领导之下，开始树立新的劳动态度，积极生产。（二）党、政、工三方面树立了生产第一的领导思想，市委于去年年底进行了全年工作的检查，传达了华北局一九五○年生产指示与察省省委的决议。省工业厅和张家口市总工会均先后召开会议，一再强调党、政、工首要的任务就是领导生产。（三）初步实现了管理民主化。在新纪录运动中克服了工厂管理委员会徒具形式的偏向，吸收大批劳模和生产积极分子参加工厂管理，提高了职工参加工厂管理的责任心和积极性。同时在工会领导及党和团的保证下，各工会分会或车间小组和个人又都订立了生产计划，这就使行政上所订的生产计划，变成了群众自觉的行动，使生产任务的实现有了可靠的保证。
