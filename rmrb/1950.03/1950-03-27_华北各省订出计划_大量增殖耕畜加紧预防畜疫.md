Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- To fulfill this year's grain and cotton production increase tasks in the North China region, the people's governments of North China provinces have formulated plans for increasing farm animals and preventing livestock diseases, and some areas have already begun active implementation.

Regarding increasing livestock, Shanxi Province plans to breed 100,000 head this year and purchase 100,000 head from livestock producing areas. To accomplish this task, the province plans to add 204 breeding stations and 206 breeding animals. The Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank has also decided to issue millet loans of 1.4 million jin for breeding animals to help the masses purchase more. Hebei Province requires that 200,000 young animals be bred this year on the existing basis, and strives to purchase 500,000 head. The Provincial People's Government has issued orders to protect existing farm animals and strictly prohibit the slaughter of strong adult working animals, pregnant animals, and breeding animals, and is carrying out farm animal registration. To complete this year's plan to breed 120,000 to 150,000 farm animals, Pingyuan Province has decided that the government will loan 1 million jin of millet to help poor farmers purchase breeding animals. According to incomplete statistics from Bo'ai and other four counties alone, farmers have increased their purchases of more than 2,700 farm animals in the past two months. Chahar Province requires an increase of 130,000 farm animals this year, and for this reason, the province has decided to promote more than 170 public stallions, 165 public donkeys, and 3,000 breeding mares, and has decided to implement policies to protect farm animals, dispel the masses' ideological concerns about increasing farm animals, provide loans, encourage credit lending among farmers, increase mating stations, and reward private breeding stations. Based on the specific conditions of the province, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government has determined to increase the number of cattle, horses, mules, and other farm animals by 37,000 to 47,000 head throughout the year. The main focus of the province's pastoral areas is currently on protecting existing farm animals and not killing female animals.

To prevent livestock diseases and reduce farm animal deaths, all provinces have formulated epidemic prevention plans and have begun injections. Hebei Province plans to inject 400,000 head of livestock this year. The Provincial People's Government has dispatched veterinary prevention teams to epidemic areas in Xingtai and other nine counties to carry out preventive injections. Shanxi Province held a symposium on epidemic prevention in various counties, proposing the principle of "prevention is more important than treatment." Each county has also formulated an epidemic prevention plan. Jincheng proposed to inject vaccine for 18,000 farm animals. Jiang County decided to add four epidemic prevention stations. The Pingyuan Provincial Epidemic Prevention Station has formed 18 epidemic prevention teams, which set out to various regions in mid-March to carry out mobile epidemic prevention and treatment work. To eradicate rinderpest, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have decided to universally inject 650,000 head of cattle in the two provinces.

　　华北各省订出计划
    大量增殖耕畜加紧预防畜疫
    【新华社二十四日讯】为着完成华北区今年的粮棉增产任务，华北各省人民政府都已制定增殖耕畜与预防畜疫工作的计划，有些地区已着手积极进行。
    在增殖牲畜方面，山西省准备今年繁殖十万头，向畜产区购买十万头。为完成此项任务，该省计划增加种畜站二百零四个，种畜二百零六头。人民银行山西分行并决定发放种畜贷款小米一百四十万斤，扶助群众增购种畜。河北省要求今年在现有基础上繁殖幼畜二十万头，并争取购入五十万头。该省人民政府颁布了保护现有耕畜及严禁屠宰壮年役畜、孕畜、种畜等命令，并进行耕畜登记。平原省为完成今年繁殖耕畜十二万至十五万头计划，决定由政府贷米一百万斤，扶助贫困农民购买种畜。仅据博爱等四县不完全统计，两个月来农民已增买耕畜二千七百余头。察哈尔省今年要求增加耕畜十三万头，为此该省决定推广公种马一百七十余匹、公种驴一百六十五头、母种马三千匹，并决定要贯彻保护耕畜政策，解除群众对增殖耕畜的思想顾虑，举办贷款，鼓励农民间的信用借贷，增加交配站，奖励私营种畜站。绥远省人民政府根据该省具体条件，确定全年增加牛、马、骡等耕畜三万七千头到四万七千头。该省畜牧区目前主要为保护现有耕畜，不杀母畜等。
    为防止畜疫，减少耕畜死亡，各省均定出防疫计划，并已开始进行注射。河北省计划今年注射牲畜四十万头，现该省人民政府已派兽医预防组赶赴邢台等九县畜疫地区进行预防注射。山西省曾召开各县防疫座谈会，提出“预防重于治疗”的方针。各县亦拟定了防疫计划。晋城提出为一万八千头耕畜注射防疫苗。绛县决定增设四个防疫站。平原省防疫总站已组成十八个防疫组，于本月中旬分赴各专区进行巡回防疫治疗工作。察、绥两省为根绝牛瘟，决定将该两省六十五万头牛普遍进行注射。
