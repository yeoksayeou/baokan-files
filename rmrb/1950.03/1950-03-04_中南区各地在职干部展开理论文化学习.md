　　Cadres in Central and South China Launch Theoretical and Cultural Studies
According to the "Decision on Cadre Study While on Duty" issued by the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on January 15, the directly affiliated organs of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, the South China Branch of the CPC Central Committee, and the party, government, and military organs of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have established study committees at all levels to arrange and carry out the study of cadres while on duty. The General Study Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee was established before the Spring Festival. It leads the affiliated sub-study committees to divide the cadres of the directly affiliated organs into three groups—A, B, and C—according to their cultural and theoretical level and struggle experience, using a method of self-reporting and public discussion. These groups will study the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and On Socialist Economic Construction (Group A), Political Economy (Group B), and A Brief History of Social Development (Group C). Cadres whose cultural knowledge is below junior high school level will participate in the organs' school to study culture. Each organ has now established study plans for the next six months and the next three months. The Propaganda Department of the Central China Bureau is preparing to compile and issue "Selected Study Readings" every month as supplementary reading material for the studies. The sub-study committees of the General Office and the Social Department of the Central China Bureau are currently focusing on enabling all cadres to develop a study habit of adhering to a two-hour study system every day. A sign-in system has also been implemented for cadres' studies in other organs. The General Study Committee of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government has also been established, and the directly affiliated organs have formed twenty-seven sub-study committees. They are now actively preparing to establish an organ's cultural remedial school. The General Study Committee has also established a specific study plan for the first half of the year and stipulated a regular reporting system to overcome the disorganized and unplanned dispersion that occurred in the on-the-job cadre studies last year. The South China Branch of the CPC Central Committee has decided to directly lead the cadre studies of the organs stationed in Guangzhou. The Guangzhou General Study Committee has been formed, with Ye Jianying concurrently serving as the secretary of the committee. Before the establishment of the South China General Study Committee, this committee will act on its behalf in leading the study of the branch study committees of the local committees, counties, and districts in South China. According to the situation in Guangzhou, where the lack of organization and discipline among cadres is still serious due to the recent liberation of Guangdong and Guangxi, the Guangzhou General Study Committee has decided that the content of the studies in February and March will be the rectification of cadres' thinking, and in April, they will study the three major documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　中南区各地在职干部展开理论文化学习
    【新华社汉口电】中共中央中南局、武汉市人民政府、中共中央华南分局的各直属机关和广东省、广州市的党政军机关根据中共中央中南局一月十五日发出的《关于在职干部学习的决定》，分别成立了各级学习委员会，布置并开展在职干部的学习。中共中央中南局直属机关总学委会已于春节前成立，并领导所属各分学委会，将直属各机关的干部按其文化、理论水平和斗争经验，以自报公议的办法，编为甲、乙、丙三组，分别进行学习联共党史和论社会主义经济建设（甲组）、政治经济学（乙组）、社会发展简史（丙组）；其余文化知识不及初中毕业程度的干部，则一律参加机关学校，学习文化。现各机关已订出半年和最近三个月的学习计划。中南局宣传部并预备每月编发《学习文选》作为学习的补充读物。中南局秘书处、社会部的分学委会，目前首先着重于使所有干部养成坚持每天两小时的学习制度的学习习惯，其他机关的干部学习也都实行了签到制度。武汉市人民政府总学习委员会亦已成立，各直属机关也已组成二十七个学委分会，现正在积极筹办机关文化补习学校。总学委会并订出了上半年的具体学习计划，规定定期汇报制度，以克服去年在职干部学习中所曾发生的无组织、无计划的涣散现象。中共中央华南分局，决定直接领导驻广州市各机关干部学习，已组成广州市总学委会，由叶剑英兼该会书记。该会并将在华南总学委会未成立前代为领导华南各地委、县、区的分、支学委会进行学习。广州市总学委会根据两广解放不久、干部中无组织无纪律现象仍严重存在的情况，决定二、三两月份的学习以整顿干部思想为内容，四月份内学习人民政协三大文件。
