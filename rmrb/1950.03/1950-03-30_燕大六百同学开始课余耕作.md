　　Six Hundred Yanjing University Students Begin After-School Farming
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Five hundred and ninety-nine students at Yanjing University have participated in after-school production, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of students. Students from the Department of Home Economics and the Department of Economics have all participated, and are challenging other departments.
    The university held a "Production Groundbreaking Ceremony" on the afternoon of the 27th. Amidst the sounds of drums and cymbals, Dean of Academic Affairs Lin Handa took the stage to deliver a speech, encouraging everyone to "not be afraid of getting dirty or smelly, and to integrate learning with production." Experienced workers also reported on the key points of vegetable planting. Each production team has been assigned land and has begun cultivation.
    The university's cultivated land is located in Langrun Garden, Xingren Hall, and Huadongzi on campus, and is planted with Chinese cabbage, red radishes, spinach, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Male students from the College of Arts and Law work three hours a week, cultivating five li of land each; students from the College of Science and Engineering and female students cultivate a slightly smaller area. In terms of technical guidance, workers such as Yang Wentian are helping. There were originally forty pieces of farm equipment, and the school has now borrowed funds to purchase sixty more, which are used in rotation according to different working hours.

　　燕大六百同学开始课余耕作
    【本报讯】燕京大学参加课余生产的同学已有五百九十九人，占全体同学的百分之六十以上；家政系和经济系同学均全体参加，并向各系挑战。
    该校于二十七日下午举行了“生产动土典礼”，鼓钹声中，林汉达教务长登台致词，勉励大家“不怕脏、不怕臭，学习与生产打成一片。”并由熟练工友报告了种菜工作要点。各生产小组，已分配土地，开始耕作。
    该校耕地在校内朗润园、兴仁堂、花洞子等处，种的是小白菜、红水萝卜、菠菜、西红柿等。文法学院男同学每人每周工作三小时，耕五厘地；理工学院同学及女同学耕作面积略少。技术指导方面，请工友杨文田等七八人帮助。农具原有四十件，现又由学校贷款采购六十件，按不同工作时间，轮流使用。（燕大通讯组）
