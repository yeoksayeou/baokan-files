Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th. Guo Zihua, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, reported on the work of the Provincial People's Government since the beginning of the War of Liberation at the first All-Circles People's Representatives Conference of Shandong Province.

He first explained that the Shandong Provincial People's Government was established and developed by the people of Shandong under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year-plus People's War of Liberation. During the War of Liberation, Shandong Province was the battlefield where Chiang Kai-shek's bandits concentrated eighty-one brigades for a key offensive. After the people of the province joined the army and supported the front lines, carried out land reform and production for disaster relief, overcame all difficulties, eliminated the enemy, and achieved liberation of the entire territory.

Next, he reported on the general situation of the government's main tasks since the beginning of the War of Liberation:

Regarding support for the front lines: The people of Shandong contributed great strength in the People's War of Liberation, completed the arduous task of supporting the front lines, raised their awareness, and educated and trained a large number of cadres. In the three years from the summer of 1946 to the Huaihai Campaign in early 1949, more than 590,000 people joined the army; more than 1.54 million militiamen and laborers served with the army. Including the standing militia and laborers on the second line, a total of 12.5 million militiamen and laborers participated in the war. The province as a whole contributed more than 6.15 billion catties of public grain. People in the rear, regardless of men, women, old, or young, all competed to assist the army, care for the wounded, make military shoes, grind military grain, and help the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and working cadres in production. The vast numbers of women and children also actively participated in farming and rear service. Workers in military industry, military supplies, railways, highways, shipping, posts and telecommunications, and factories and mines, under extremely difficult conditions, rushed to manufacture ordnance, make military uniforms, repair railways, restore transportation, and step up factory and mine production to ensure the supply and water transportation to the front lines. However, in the work, there were also shortcomings such as wasting manpower and financial resources, neglecting production in the rear, a coercive command style, and insufficient and thorough care for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers.

Regarding land reform: The vast number of laboring peasants in rural Shandong greatly improved their class consciousness due to the rent and interest reduction movement during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the peasants more urgently demanded land reform. The province began a land reform movement in the autumn of 1946 to eliminate the feudal exploitation system, which increased the peasants' enthusiasm for production, and the face of the countryside was renewed. At present, land reform has been carried out in about 72 percent of Shandong Province, some of which are not yet thorough. Now the peasants generally demand that the land reform be thoroughly completed and ended, and that land rights be formally determined so that they can concentrate on production. Farmers in the new areas are also eager to have land distributed. Therefore, it is hoped that the land reform will be completed and ended throughout the province in 1950.

Regarding production and disaster relief: Shandong farmers suffered severe damage from Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, resulting in years of continuous disasters. In the spring of 1948, there were about three to four million disaster victims in the province. The Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Government led the vast people to widely carry out a production self-rescue movement. The Party, government, army, and people worked together to overcome the disasters and eliminated more than 1.5 million mu of wasteland, and carried out spring plowing and production. From spring to autumn last year, droughts, insects, diseases, hail, wind, water and other disasters came one after another. According to statistics, 103 counties in the province suffered from floods, inundating more than 12.48 million mu of land, accounting for more than 12 percent of the province's arable land. In the past year, the government has vigorously mobilized the people to fight against various disasters and achieved great results. For example, the completion of the Yellow River spring repair and flood season rescue ensured the safety of the thousand-mile river defense, and the people were mobilized to dig wells and repair wells, and generally carried out irrigation, planting, and replanting to fight drought; in the flood-stricken areas, the people were organized to drain water and save 90 percent of the submerged land. After replanting and replanting, most of the wheat fields were sown in time. In the disaster areas, production was organized to overcome famine. It is estimated that the harvest of early-maturing crops and accumulated vegetables in the Jiaodong area alone can offset 150 million to 200 million catties of grain. In addition, great achievements have been made in carrying out savings and donation movements and implementing work-relief. However, due to the long-term devastation and serious damage to the rural economy by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, coupled with insufficient understanding of the disaster situation by some leading cadres, serious phenomena such as fleeing famine have occurred in some severely affected areas. In the future, it is necessary to follow the instructions of the Central People's Government on production and disaster relief, carry forward past experience, overcome the paralyzing thoughts of some cadres, do everything possible to overcome difficulties, implement production and disaster relief work, and restore rural productivity.

Regarding financial and economic work: In terms of agricultural production, although the disasters were serious, thanks to the joint rescue efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, and the active production of the vast number of peasants, last year's wheat harvest still reached a general level, with the provincial autumn harvest averaging around 60 percent, and the planting plan for industrial raw materials was basically completed. In terms of industrial production, since the Weixian Campaign in the spring of 1948, under the guidance of the urban policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in accordance with the Seven Articles of the Law issued by the East China Military Region, the takeover work was carried out, which was warmly supported by the people of all walks of life in the city. Workers and staff actively protected factories and mines, assisted the government, and smoothly took over factories and mines in various places, overcame various difficulties, and quickly restored production. After two years of efforts, state-owned heavy and light industries have made considerable achievements in restoring production. For example, last year, the province's coal mines have recovered to 45 percent of the highest output during the enemy-puppet rule, exceeding 7 percent before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Seventy percent of the military industry has been converted to peacetime industry. Another example is that all state-owned textile mills have started operations. The average operating rate of machines in Qingdao China Textile Company has reached 95 percent of the equipment. The productivity of 20-count cotton yarn per spindle every 20 hours has increased from 0.89 pounds in June last year to 1 pound, and the productivity of 12-pound cotton cloth per machine every 20 hours has increased from 70 yards to 90 yards. In the private sector, thanks to the implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and management, industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood have also achieved initial recovery and development.

Next, he briefly described the general situation of cultural and educational, news and publishing, health, and public security and judicial work.

Finally, Vice Chairman Guo said: In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and strengthen the great unity of the people's revolution, since last year, all counties and cities in the province have convened people's representative conferences of all walks of life, which has established a better connection between the people's government and the people of all walks of life, strengthened the democratic style and democratic system, and advanced democratic construction.

　　在山东省首届各界代表会议上
    郭子化报告政府工作
    一千三百万人参军、参战；缴纳公粮六十余亿斤。全省近四分之三地区已进行土地改革。战胜了连年灾害；消灭荒地百五十万亩。顺利接收了工厂矿山；煤产已超过抗日战争前百分之七。全省各县市均召开了各界人民代表会议。
    【新华社济南十七日电】山东省人民政府副主席郭子化在山东省首届各界人民代表会议上，报告省人民政府自解放战争开始以来的工作。
    他首先说明山东省人民政权，是山东人民在中国共产党领导下，于八年抗日战争和三年多人民解放战争中建立和发展起来的。在解放战争中，山东省曾是蒋匪集中八十一个旅重点进攻的战场，经过全省人民参军参战，支援前线，并先后进行了土地改革和生产救灾，战胜了一切困难，消灭了敌人，获得全境解放。
    接着，他报告了解放战争开始以来政府的几项主要工作概况：
    关于支援前线工作：山东人民在人民解放战争中，贡献了伟大的力量，完成了艰巨的支援前线任务，提高了自己的觉悟，并教育和锻炼出了大批干部。在一九四六年夏至一九四九年初淮海战役止的三年中，先后参军者达五十九万余人；随军服务的民兵、民工一百五十四万余人，如连第二线常备民工在内，则参战的民兵、民工共达一千二百五十万余人。全省总计缴纳公粮六十一亿五千万余斤。后方人民无论男女老幼，均争先恐后协助军队、照顾伤员、做军鞋、磨军粮、帮助革命烈士、军人和工作干部的家属生产，广大妇女儿童亦均踊跃参加耕作和担任后方勤务。军工、军需、铁路、公路、航运、邮电及各厂矿工人，则在极度困难条件下，赶造械弹，赶制军衣，抢修铁路，恢复交通，加紧工厂矿山生产，保证了前方的供应与水陆运输。但在工作中，也曾发生过浪费民力财力、忽视后方生产、强迫命令作风以及对烈军工属照顾不够切实周到等缺点。
    关于土地改革工作：山东农村广大劳动农民，由于在抗日时期经过减租减息运动，阶级觉悟大为提高，故在抗战胜利后，农民更迫切地要求土地改革。全省遂自一九四六年秋开展土地改革运动，消灭封建剥削制度，因之提高了农民生产积极性，农村面貌为之一新。目前山东全省已进行土地改革地区约占百分之七十二左右，其中尚有部分不彻底者。现农民普遍要求彻底完成与结束土地改革，正式确定地权，以便安心生产。新区农民亦迫切要求分配土地。因此，希望在一九五○年内，全省完成并结束土地改革。
    关于生产救灾工作：山东农民由于遭受日寇、蒋匪惨重破坏，酿成连年灾荒。一九四八年春，全省灾民约有三、四百万。中共中央山东分局和山东省人民政府领导广大人民广泛开展了生产自救运动。党政军民一致努力战胜了灾荒，并消灭了一百五十余万亩荒地，进行了春耕生产。去年自春至秋，旱、虫、病、雹、风、水等灾又相继袭来。据统计：全省一百○三县遭受水灾，淹地一千二百四十八万余亩，约占全省耕地百分之十二强。一年来，政府大力发动人民与各种灾害进行斗争，获得了巨大的成绩。如完成黄河春修及汛期抢险，确保了千里河防，并发动人民打井、修井，普遍进行浇地、点种、补种，以抗旱灾；在水灾区组织人民排水，救出百分之九十的淹地，经抢种补种，大部麦地均及时播种，在灾区组织生产渡荒，仅胶东区早熟作物及积菜的收获，估计可抵一亿五千万至二亿斤粮食。此外，在开展节约捐献运动和实行工赈救济等方面，亦均获得了巨大的成绩。但由于日寇、蒋匪长期摧残和严重破坏农村经济，加以某些领导干部对灾情认识不足，致部分重灾地区已发生逃荒等严重现象。今后必须根据中央人民政府关于生产救灾指示，发扬以往经验，克服某些干部的麻痹思想，尽一切可能战胜困难，贯彻生产救灾工作，恢复农村生产力。
    关于财政经济工作：在农业生产方面，虽然灾荒严重，但由于党政军民协力抢救和广大农民积极生产，去年麦收仍能达一般水平，全省秋收平均在六成左右，并在基本上完成了工业原料的种植计划。在工业生产方面，自一九四八年春潍县战役以来，在中共中央城市政策指导下，遵照华东军区颁发的约法七章，进行了接管工作，取得了城市各界人民的热烈拥护，工人职员更积极护厂护矿，协助政府，顺利地接收了各地工厂矿山，克服了各种困难，迅速恢复生产。经两年来努力，公营重、轻工业在恢复生产上均有相当成就。例如去年本省煤矿已恢复到敌伪统治时期最高产量的百分之四十五，较抗日战争前则已超过百分之七。军工工业已有百分之七十转入平时工业。又如公营纺织厂已全部开工，青岛中纺公司机器平均运转率目前已达设备的百分之九十五，二十支棉纱生产率每锭每二十小时已自去年六月之○·八九磅增至一磅，十二磅棉布生产率每台每二十小时从七○码增至九○码。私营企业方面，由于执行了公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策，有益于国计民生的工业亦已获得初步的恢复和发展。
    接着，他又简述了文教、新闻出版、卫生工作和公安司法工作的概况。
    最后，郭副主席说：为了巩固人民民主专政和加强人民革命大团结，去年以来，全省各县、市均已召开了各界人民代表会议，使人民政府与各界人民建立了更好的联系，加强了民主作风、民主制度，使民主建设前进了一步。
