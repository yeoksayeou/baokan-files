　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 19th. Most of the highways in Yunnan Province have been repaired and are open to traffic. The province has a total of 4,470 kilometers of highways. Before liberation, three-quarters of the routes were destroyed by the Chiang bandits. After the liberation of various parts of Yunnan, the People's Liberation Army and highway workers, in cooperation with the broad masses of peasants, actively carried out emergency repairs. As of now, 79 large and small bridges have been repaired, and more than 3,100 kilometers of highways have been restored. The main highways in the province, such as the Kunming-Wanting section of the Burma Road and the Yunnan-Guizhou Road (Kunming to Guiyang), have all been opened to traffic, which has greatly enhanced the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. According to statistics for the first half of March, an average of 100 trucks per day travel between Kunming and various counties, with approximately 200 tons of goods entering and leaving.

　　云南公路大部修复
    【新华社重庆十九日电】云南省公路大部分已修复通车。全省公路计长四千四百七十公里。解放前有四分之三的路线遭蒋匪破坏。云南各地相继解放后，人民解放军和公路工人配合广大农民积极展开抢修工作。截至目前为止，已修复大小桥梁七十九座，恢复公路三千一百多公里，全省主要公路如滇缅路昆明至畹町段，滇黔路（昆明至贵阳）等均已全部通车，城乡物资交流因之大为增进。据三月份上半月统计，昆明市与各县间往来货车每日平均有百辆，进出货物在二百吨左右。
