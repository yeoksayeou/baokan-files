　　From Party Life to See the Party
    Zhang Changgong
    I am a non-Party member. Is it a bit of a stretch to write about Party life from the perspective of a non-Party member? But that's not how I see it. Because I live among Party organizations every day, from having no understanding of the Party to understanding it, from being an observer to getting close to the Party, to eagerly requesting to join the Party; so I have ample reason to write about Party life, because Party life directly affects me.
    Before I started working, I first went to the North China United University to study. Intellectuals from the city, going to the countryside, are always unrealistic, speaking bombastically, not proceeding from reality, their minds full of beautiful fantasies. But these things are not "now," they are "future," only hoping for how the future will be, but not starting from the present. Full of shortcomings myself, I only criticize others, and have plenty of reasons to defend myself, such as "Living in the old society, who can be blamed for this!"
    I had opinions about some Party member comrades, these opinions were not about matters of principle, but often trivial details of life. Thinking, "This person is also a Party member? Look, he doesn't wash his dirty clothes." Seeing Party members criticizing something, I felt they were really good at lecturing people, feeling that Party members were just ordinary people, so I looked down on them. In this way, I gradually isolated myself and felt that life was lonely and monotonous.
    The Party in the school became public, and I went to this open Party congress with a curious mind, "Let's see, who are the heroes among the Party members?" But the solemnity and seriousness of the meeting gave me a profound education.
    After the list of Party members was announced, the branch secretary reported on the work summary of the branch. There was no exaggeration or concealment in the summary. During the entire study period, the Party played a leading role in every movement. But it wasn't as I thought, that the Party wanted to do whatever it wanted. All the Party's activities were for the progress of the study movement and the advancement of the students.
    Once, a Party member comrade, Wang Chunfeng, made a big fuss because of a job transfer, developing to the point where he even publicly insulted the organization.
    My incorrect thoughts sprouted again: "Look, an old comrade who has been in the revolution for seven or eight years! This kind of behavior!"
    But in a few days, the Party notified me to attend the Party branch meeting as a non-voting delegate. The Party committee also came. The main purpose of this meeting was to examine why Comrade Wang was making trouble. The responsible comrade of the branch first examined that the education and care for comrades were insufficient, which led him to commit such a serious mistake. Then came Comrade Wang's self-criticism. He said: "The leadership is not democratic? Personnel relations (regarding job transfers and assignments as personnel issues), ...etc." But after Party and non-Party comrades raised some opinions to him, he was speechless, so it was decided to continue the meeting tomorrow.
    In the evening, he returned to the dormitory and cried. Although he still emphasized that objective reasons caused him to violate revolutionary discipline, he was pained that he was a Party member, yet he was so unorganized and undisciplined to this point. He didn't sleep well all night, always hearing him tossing and turning in bed, sighing.
    The next day his self-criticism was much more profound. He realized that this was an extreme manifestation of lawless individualism, and he asked the Party to give him a punishment. The Party committee decided that this was not enough, and let him continue to reflect. At the same time, it was decided that if necessary, he would make a self-criticism at a mass meeting.
    After thoroughly reflecting, Comrade Wang realized that this mistake had caused undue losses to the Party.
    The Party's iron discipline not only educated Comrade Wang, but also educated the masses. Subsequently, Comrade Wang gladly accepted the new job.
    These things are extremely ordinary in Party life, but precisely because these are ordinary things and ordinary people, the masses have come to recognize the greatness of the Party.

### 从党的生活来看党

　　从党的生活来看党
    张长工
    我是一个非党员，以一个非党员的身份来写党的生活，是不是有点捕风捉影；但是我的理解并非这样。因为我是天天生活在党组织周围的一个人，从对党没有认识到有认识，从旁观到靠近党，到迫切要求入党；所以我有充分的理由来写写党的生活，因为党的生活直接影响着我。
    在我参加工作以前，先入华北联大学习。一个城市的知识分子到乡下去，总是好高鹜远、说大话、不从实际出发，脑子里充满了美妙的幻想。但这些东西不是“现在”，是“未来”，只盼着未来如何如何，而不从现在做起。自己满身缺点，却只挑剔别人，还有充分的理由来为自己辩护，如“生活在旧社会吗，这能怨谁”！
    对一些党员同志有意见，这些意见并不是原则立场问题，而常是些生活末节。觉得这个人也是党员？你看他衣服脏了也不洗，看见党员批评一件事情，就觉得他们真好教训人，觉得党员们也不过是些平凡的人，就瞧不起他们。就这样我渐渐把自己孤立起来，而感到生活寂寞单调。
    学校中的党公开了，我怀着好奇的心去参加这次公开党的大会，“看看吧，党员都是那些好汉？”但是会议的庄重、严肃，给我以深刻地教育。
    党员名单公布后，支书报告支部工作总结。总结中没有夸大的地方也没有隐藏的地方。在整个学习中间，每个运动党都起了领导作用。但并不是如我所想的，党想搞什么就搞什么。党的一切活动都是为学习运动的前进，和学员的进步。
    有一次一个党员同志王春逢，因为调动工作而大闹情绪，发展到严重的程度的时候甚至公开侮辱组织。
    我的不正确思想又萌芽了：“看，革命七八年的老同志！这种作风！”
    但是没有几天党就通知我列席党的支部大会。党委也来了，这次会主要的是检讨王同志为什么闹情绪？支部负责同志首先检讨了对同志教育、照顾不够，而使他犯了这样严重的错误。接着是王同志检讨，他说：“领导上不民主？人事关系（把调动工作分配工作岗位看成人事问题），……等等。”但在党与非党同志对他提了些意见之后，他哑口无言了，于是决定明天继续开会。
    晚上他回到宿舍就哭起来了。虽然他还强调客观原因使他犯了革命纪律，但是他痛苦的是自己是一个党员，竟无组织无纪律到了这种地步。一晚上他没有睡好，总听见他在床上反来覆去，唉声叹气。
    第二天他的检讨就深刻多了。他认识到这是个人主义发展到极端的一种无法无天的表现，他请求党给他处分。党委决定认为这还不够，让他继续反省。同时决定必要时在群众会上作检讨。
    王同志在彻底反省以后，认识到这种错误给党招致了不该有的损失。
    党的铁的纪律不但教育了王同志，而且教育了群众。随后，王同志就欣然的接受了新的工作。
    这些事情在党的生活中是极其平常的，但正因为这是平常的事平凡的人，才更使群众认识了党的伟大。
