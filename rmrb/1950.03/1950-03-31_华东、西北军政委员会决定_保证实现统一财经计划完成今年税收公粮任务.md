Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 30th: The East China Military and Administrative Committee held its sixth administrative meeting on the 28th of this month, and passed the "Instructions on Guaranteeing the Implementation of the 'Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Unified National Financial and Economic Work'."

The instructions first stated that the East China Military and Administrative Committee unanimously and resolutely supports the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on unified national financial and economic work, and ordered all levels of people's governments to abide by it. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of this decision in the East China region, the instructions specifically stipulated: 1. The decision to unify the management of national financial revenue and expenditure must be unconditionally obeyed. The "approved revenue and expenditure budget and grain tax sharing management" method implemented by provinces (cities) in East China in the past can no longer meet the requirements of national financial unification. Now, in accordance with the central government's regulations, all public grain and tax revenue, except for the local surcharges on public grain and local taxes that have been approved by the central government, must be guaranteed to be fully turned over to the national treasury. Without the payment order from the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, no one is allowed to use it without authorization. 2. People's governments at all levels must attach importance to and strengthen leadership over the consolidation of tax collection and tax work, enrich tax authorities at all levels, and improve the quality of tax cadres. East China is a region with developed industry and commerce in the country, and it is necessary to vigorously consolidate urban tax collection, especially in Shanghai, attention should be paid to consolidating industrial and commercial taxes. 3. Each province must guarantee the completion of this year's summer public grain collection. 4. The clearing of warehouse materials should be carried out separately by the local people's government (including both finance and enterprise) and the military system, and should be completed before the end of June. The East China Warehouse Material Clearing Committee must focus on thoroughly investigating the materials in Shanghai's national warehouses, properly keep them in storage, report them level by level, and await central allocation. 5. The people's establishment and the number of people in each province (city) have been stipulated, and no unauthorized changes can be made without approval, and the reorganization must be completed before the end of May. 6. All expenditures should strictly abide by the system, practice strict economy, and oppose corruption, greed and waste. 7. It is necessary to strictly abide by the "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Unified Implementation Measures for National State-Owned Trade." The East China Trade Department and the trade halls or industry and commerce bureaus of each province (city) should strengthen leadership to ensure and supervise its implementation. 8. The East China Trade Department must complete the transportation of trade grain in accordance with the plan; the governments of each province (city) should be responsible for guaranteeing and strictly checking it. The people's governments in disaster areas such as northern Anhui, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, in addition to quickly distributing relief grain, may send part of the trade grain to the disaster areas to adjust the people's food supply without hindering the city's supply. 9. Regarding the implementation of the East China industrial and mining enterprises production plan and the task of depreciation and profit delivery to the state treasury decided by the various industrial departments of the Central People's Government this year, the East China Industry Department is responsible for formulating specific plans, and the department and the people's governments of each province (city) shall guarantee and urge its completion.

The instructions finally require that the people's governments of each province (city) should earnestly discuss, fully mobilize, distinguish between urgency and priority, combine with the original work arrangements, and implement them step by step within the specified time to ensure the full realization of the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on unified national financial and economic work.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 29th: The Northwest Military and Administrative Committee held its ninth administrative meeting on the 28th of this month. The main content of the meeting was to discuss and approve the "Decision on Implementing the State Council's Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work"; approved the summary report of Jia Tuofu, director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee, at the Northwest Financial Conference and the Northwest Region Trade Department's work plan for 1950.

The meeting pointed out that the Northwest region's financial work in the past has been successful, and it has basically completed the victorious task of supporting the war to liberate the Great Northwest. However, there are still serious shortcomings in the work: First, governments at all levels have generally not paid enough attention to various national financial revenues, so that various tax tasks have not been completed according to the predetermined plan. For example, only 69% of last year's public grain has been put into storage so far; the corporate income tax from last winter has not yet been fully collected and deposited into the treasury; only 40% of the tax revenue in the first quarter of this year has been completed according to the predetermined plan; and only 5% of the salt tax has been completed according to the predetermined plan. Second, in terms of expenditure, many units emphasize local needs, lack a global perspective and a spirit of thrift, do not strictly abide by the financial system, arbitrarily use public grain and taxes, and personnel and horses are arbitrarily increased, resulting in a lack of a solid basis for the financial plan and falling into a blind state. Third, there is a dependence on superiors. Fourth, financial work lacks careful calculation, regardless of urgency, resulting in many extravagant and wasteful phenomena.

In response to the above shortcomings, the meeting decided: 1. People's governments at all levels must make their best efforts to ensure the 100% completion of the 1950 financial revenue plan. Local governments and tax authorities in charge must immediately dispatch cadres to strengthen public grain and tax work; through people's representatives conferences and farmers' representatives conferences, mobilize the masses to supervise and encourage households in arrears to quickly pay the public grain and taxes, and strive to complete the task as soon as possible. 2. Governments at all levels must immediately establish establishment committees at all levels and complete the reorganization work as scheduled. 3. Each province, city, and county must immediately establish warehouse material clearing and allocation committees, and the clearing work shall be completed before May 30. 4. Strictly implement the grain depot and treasury system, unify the management of financial revenue and expenditure, and strictly implement the financial supervision and inspection system. 5. Dispatch outstanding cadres to serve as directors of tax bureaus, grain bureaus, salt affairs bureaus, grain depot directors, and treasury directors at all levels, and enrich their work cadres.

In order to implement the various decisions of this meeting of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee, the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on the same day, instructing party committees at all levels to pay attention to grain work and quickly strengthen tax work, correct the one-sided "benevolent government" viewpoint among cadres and the tendency to not pay attention to mastering policies, and ensure that this year's tax and public grain plan is fully completed. The notice pointed out that party committees at all levels and party members working in various government departments must consciously and strictly abide by national laws and regulations. If there are illegal acts such as sabotage of the system and corruption, in addition to being severely punished by national laws, they will also be subject to party disciplinary sanctions.

    保证实现统一财经计划完成今年税收公粮任务
    【新华社上海三十日电】华东军政委员会本月二十八日举行第六次行政例会，通过了“关于保证贯彻执行‘中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定’的指示”。
    指示首先说明：华东军政委员会一致坚决拥护中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，并责令各级人民政府遵照执行。为了保证这一决定在华东区的彻底实施，指示具体规定：一、统一管理国家财政收支的决定，必须无条件地遵照执行。华东各省（市）区过去所实行的“核定收支概算和粮税分成管理”的办法，已经不能适合全国财政统一的要求；现在，必须遵照中央规定，所有公粮、税款收入，除已经中央批准的地方附加公粮及地方税收外，均须保证全部缴入国库，非经中央人民政府财政部支付命令，不准擅自动支。二、各级人民政府必须重视和加强对整理税收和税收工作的领导，充实各级税务机关，提高税务干部的质量。华东为全国工商业发达的地区，必须大力整理城市税收，上海尤须注意整理工商业税。三、各省区必须保证完成今年夏季公粮的征收。四、关于清理仓库物资，分地方人民政府（包括财政及企业两部分）与军队两个系统进行，统限于六月底前完成。华东仓库物资清理委员会尤须着重将上海国家仓库的物资彻底清查，妥为保管，按级上报，听候中央调配。各省（市）区的人民编制及数额业已规定，非经批准，不能擅自改变，并限于五月底前整编完毕。六、一切开支，均应严格遵守制度，厉行节约，反对污贪浪费。七、必须严格遵照中央人民政府政务院“关于全国国营贸易统一实施办法的决定”，华东贸易部及各省（市）区的贸易厅或工商厅局应加强领导，保证并监督其实施。八、华东贸易粮的调运，华东贸易部必须按照计划如期完成；各省（市）区政府应负责保证并严加检查。皖北、山东、苏北等灾区的人民政府除迅速发放救济粮外，在不妨碍城市供应的原则下，得将部分贸易粮送至灾区，调剂民食。九、关于执行中央人民政府各工业部所决定的本年华东各工矿企业生产计划及折旧和利润解交国库的任务，责成华东工业部制定具体方案，并由该部及各省（市）区人民政府保证与督促其完成。
    指示最后要求各省（市）区人民政府应切实讨论，充分动员，分别缓急先后，结合原有工作部署，按规定时间，有步骤地实施，以保证中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定的全部实现。
    【新华社西安二十九日电】西北军政委员会在本月二十八日举行了第九次行政会议。会议的主要内容是讨论并通过了“关于贯彻政务院统一国家财政经济工作的决定”；批准了西北财经委员会主任贾拓夫在西北财政会议上的总结报告和西北区贸易部一九五○年的工作计划。
    会议指出：西北区过去的财政工作是有成绩的，基本上已完成了支援解放大西北战争的胜利任务。但工作中仍存在着严重的缺点：第一，各级政府对于国家各项财政收入普遍重视不够，以致各项税收任务都未能按预定计划完成。如去年度公粮，至今只入仓百分之六十九强；去年冬季的营利事业所得税，至今尚未全部征齐入库；本年第一季度税收至今还只完成预定计划百分之四十；盐税仅完成预定计划百分之五。第二，在支出方面，许多单位强调局部需要，缺乏全局观点和节约精神，不严格遵守财政制度，随便动用公粮和税款，人员马匹擅自增加，致使财政计划缺乏确实根据，陷于盲目状态。第三，存在着依赖上级的思想。第四，财政工作缺乏精打细算，不分缓急轻重，形成许多铺张浪费现象。
    针对上述缺点，会议决定：一、各级人民政府必须用最大努力，保证百分之百地完成一九五○年的财政收入计划。各地政府及主管税收机关必须立即抽派干部加强公粮与税收工作；通过各界人民代表会和农民代表会，发动群众，督促和鼓励欠交户迅速缴纳的公粮和税款，务期尽速完成任务。二、各级政府必须立即成立各级编制委员会，如期完成整编工作。三、各省、市、县必须立即成立仓库物资清理调配委员会，清理工作统限于五月三十日以前完成。四、严格实行粮库和金库制度，统一管理财政收支，严格实行财政监督与检查制度。五、调派优秀干部担任各级税务局长、粮食局长、盐务局长、粮库主任、金库主任，并充实其工作干部。
    为贯彻西北军政委员会此次会议的各项决定，中共中央西北局特于同日发出通知，责成各级党委注重粮食工作和迅速加强税收工作，纠正干部中片面的“仁政”观点和不注意掌握政策的偏向，保证今年税收和公粮计划的全部完成。通知指出，各级党委以及在政府各部门中工作的党员，必须自觉地严格遵守国家法令，如有破坏制度和贪污腐化等违法行为，除受到国家法律的严重惩罚外，同时还将受到党的纪律制裁。
