　　Why Was Children's Day Changed from April 4th to June 1st?
    Question: Why was Children's Day changed from April 4th to June 1st?
    Answer: June 1st is International Children's Day, which was decided by the International Democratic Women's Federation Council in November 1949.
    The resolution of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council regarding International Children's Day reads: "Since the Second Conference of the International Women's Federation in Budapest, the status of children in capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries has further deteriorated as a result of the evil policies of warmongers. Children are the first victims of this imperialist policy. Unemployment and poverty are rapidly increasing in these countries, and the general living standards of workers are declining, thus depriving children of the conditions necessary for physical development. Millions of children are suffering cruel torture in the inhumane wars in Greece, Vietnam, and Indonesia; Spanish children are living in unspeakable misery under the fascist tyrannical rule. New war instigators are doing everything possible to corrupt children's morals, create hatred among children for other nations, and thus cultivate them into obedient soldiers... In the face of these circumstances, the member organizations of the International Democratic Women's Federation should resolutely fight for the improvement of children's lives. For this purpose, the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation has resolved to designate June 1st of each year as International Children's Day."
    Now the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule, achieved unprecedented great revolutionary victory, and established the People's Republic of China and their own Central People's Government. The children of the working people, the new generation of children, have been liberated from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and have become the little masters of the new China; and are increasingly establishing close fraternal friendship with the children of working people all over the world. In order to cultivate the internationalist thinking of the vast number of children, the State Council of the Central People's Government has stipulated that China's Children's Day should be unified with International Children's Day, and the old "April 4th Children's Day" should be abolished.

### 儿童节为什么从四月四日改为六月一日？

　　儿童节为什么从四月四日改为六月一日？
    问：儿童节为什么从四月四日改为六月一日？
    答：六月一日为国际儿童节，是在一九四九年十一月国际民主妇联理事会决定的。
    国际民主妇联理事会关于国际儿童节的决议这样写着：“自从国际妇联在布达佩斯举行第二次会议以来，由于战争贩子的罪恶政策的结果，在资本主义的、殖民地的及附属国家内的儿童的地位更加恶化了。儿童是此种帝国主义政策的第一个牺牲品。在这些国家里失业和贫穷迅速的增加着，工人的生活水平一般的在降低，因而剥夺了儿童在身体发展上所必需的条件。成百万的儿童正在希腊、越南和印尼的惨无人道的战争中遭受着残酷的折磨；西班牙的儿童在法西斯的暴虐统治的制度下，正过着不能用言语形容的困苦生活。新的战争煽动者竭尽一切力量，企图腐化儿童的道德，造成儿童对其他民族的仇恨，从而把他们养成为服从的士兵………面对着这些情况，国际民主妇联的各国会员团体理应为了儿童生活的改善作坚决的斗争。为了这个目的，国际民主妇联理事会决议在每年六月一日定为国际儿童节日”。
    现在中国人民已推翻反动统治，取得了空前的伟大的革命胜利，建立了中华人民共和国和自己的中央人民政府。劳动人民的子女，新生的一代儿童，已解脱了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫与剥削，获得了解放，作了新中国的小主人；并且与全世界劳动人民的儿童，正日益建立兄弟友谊的亲密关系。为了培养广大儿童的国际主义思想，所以中央人民政府政务院规定我国的儿童节与国际儿童节统一起来，旧的“四四儿童节”自应废除。
