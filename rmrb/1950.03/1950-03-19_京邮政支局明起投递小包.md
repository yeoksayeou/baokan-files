　　Beijing Postal Branches to Deliver Small Packages Starting Tomorrow
    [This Newspaper's Report] News from the Post Office: Previously, packages sent from various post offices were all centrally delivered by the Beijing Postal Administration. Now, to facilitate the public, starting from March 20th, branch offices will deliver individual sporadic packages weighing less than one kilogram (packages weighing more than one kilogram will still be delivered by the Administration). The following branch offices in the city have been designated to handle this: the 7th branch office at Xisi Arch, the 8th branch office at Xinjiekou, the 11th branch office at Dongsi North Street, the 15th branch office at Luomashi, the 24th branch office at Sanlihe, and the 25th branch office at Andingmen Street. After the public receives the package pick-up notice, please pay attention to the name of the delivering branch office and pick up the package nearby. (Beijing Post Office Social Service Section)
