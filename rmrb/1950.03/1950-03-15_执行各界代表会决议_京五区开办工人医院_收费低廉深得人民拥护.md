　　Implementing Resolutions of People's Representatives Conference
    Workers' Hospital Opened in Beijing's Fifth District
    Low Fees Deeply Supported by the People
    [Our Newspaper] The Fifth District of Beijing, one of the most densely populated areas of the working people, has established a workers' hospital. Since opening two months ago, it has been deeply supported by the broad masses of the people. The hospital, in accordance with the resolutions of the Beijing People's Representatives Conference, began preparations in October of last year. During the preparatory period, it first conducted publicity and deliberation among the people, organized a preparatory committee for the workers' hospital with representatives from industry, commerce, and medicine, and launched efforts to raise funds and solicit cooperation in medical work. Industrial and commercial circles donated large sums of money and utensils, and the Relief Association also added a lot of medical equipment. After obtaining the original owner's consent, the preparatory committee used the private Gulou Hospital as a foundation, made appropriate repairs and expansions, and set up ten beds. After the preparations were largely completed, it opened on January 1 this year. It stipulates that workers are exempt from outpatient registration fees, while medical expenses and the costs of maintaining the hospital are charged (lower than other hospitals); workers and citizens who are truly poor are given discretionary reductions or exemptions. In the past two months, many people have sought medical treatment. According to January statistics alone, the total number of initial visits was 289, and the number of return visits was 406, of which 161 were workers and their families, accounting for 65.7 percent of the total number of patients. The hospital plans to promote workers' health work in a planned way in the future, such as physical examinations, disease prevention, environmental sanitation, and publicity of health knowledge.

　　执行各界代表会决议
    京五区开办工人医院
    收费低廉深得人民拥护
    【本报讯】京市劳动人民密集地之一的第五区，已建立起工人医院。开诊两个月来，深受广大人民拥护。该院执行京市各界人民代表会议的决议，于去年十月间开始筹建。筹备期中，首先在人民中进行宣传酝酿，组织了有工商医各界代表参加的工人医院筹备委员会，并开展了募集资金及征求了在医务工作上合作者。工商界纷纷捐助大宗款项和器皿，救济总会也添助了不少医药器材。筹委会获得原主同意后，即以私营鼓楼医院为基础，加以适当的修整与扩充，设病床十张；筹备大体就绪后，于今年一月一日开诊。规定工人免收门诊挂号费，医药及维持院内必要开支的费用则照收（较其他医院低）；对确实贫苦之工人、市民则酌情减收或免收。两月来就医者颇多。仅据一月份统计，初诊人数共二八九人，复诊四○六人，其中工人及其家属一六一人，占患者总数的百分之六五·七。该院准备今后有计划地推广工人卫生工作，如体格检验、疾病预防、环境卫生及宣传卫生常识等。（赵培庠）
