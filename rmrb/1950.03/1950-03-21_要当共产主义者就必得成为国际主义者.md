　　To Be a Communist, One Must Be an Internationalist
    ·Bolisov·

    Workers of all countries are equally dedicated to eradicating the capitalist system. Their interests are aligned. Therefore, the closer the actions of workers of all ethnicities, the more actively they help each other, the stronger the blow against the enemy, and the closer the common victory. "Workers of all countries, unite!"—this is the concluding remark of Marx and Engels in their great work, "The Communist Manifesto." And this call has deeply penetrated the hearts of proletarians of all nations.

    While workers of all countries are committed to rapprochement, unity, and harmonious coexistence among all ethnic groups, the bourgeoisie try every possible means to isolate the laborers and instigate hatred among them. In order to divert the proletariat from class struggle and shift the blows to other aspects, the bourgeoisie spread the poisonous seeds of nationalism and incite inter-ethnic hatred, etc. Capitalism is war, and the bourgeoisie uses nationalism to provoke wars.

    Lenin said: "Bourgeois nationalism and proletarian internationalism are two irreconcilably hostile slogans, representing the two major class camps and expressing two policies (especially two world outlooks) suitable for the entire capitalist world." The policy implemented by the Bolshevik Party throughout its entire historical process is characterized by internationalism.

    To be an internationalist means to enhance friendship between all ethnic groups, to respect the laborers of any nation, and to struggle against all exploiters, regardless of the ethnic group they belong to. The Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) states that the party requires its members to work actively to "consolidate the fraternal internationalist relations between the laborers of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union and the proletarians of all countries."

    Communists sacredly execute this requirement of the Party Constitution. From the very first days of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Bolsheviks began to solve the nationality problem. The Communists of Russia carried out work among all ethnic groups in the country. They established industries within the ethnic republics, helped develop cultures with socialist content and national forms, and patiently overcame the remnants of previous mutual distrust among the various ethnic groups.

    J. Stalin taught that: "Inter-ethnic distrust, national egoism, national hatred, inter-ethnic conflicts, etc., are of course not stimulated and supported by any ethnic antipathy, but by the imperialist attempts to conquer foreign lands and the fear of these foreign lands under the threat of national enslavement."

    Some new socialist nationalities, which have formed and consolidated within the Soviet Union, have abandoned nationalist psychology and are imbued with a sense of friendship and internationalist consciousness among all ethnic groups.

    Internationalism does not contradict national pride. Internationalism has nothing in common with "national nihilism." J. Stalin taught that: "National nihilism only harms the cause of socialism and aids bourgeois nationalism." In fact, imperialists are doing everything possible to use the poisonous ideas of cosmopolitanism to suffocate the national self-esteem of all ethnic groups and eliminate their sense of patriotism. Cosmopolitanism is the ideological weapon of imperialism to plunder and enslave all ethnic groups.

    One cannot become an internationalist without first becoming a true patriot of one's own country. One cannot respect other ethnic groups without respecting and cherishing one's own people and fighting for their prosperity and happy life. The Bolsheviks carried out the socialist revolution, first and foremost, to liberate all ethnic groups residing within Russia. They acted as true patriots. The Lenin-Stalin Party always considered the Great October Socialist Revolution not only as an internal social transformation but also as an integral part of the world revolution, as a strong base that should help the laborers of other countries to achieve victory as well. Comrade Stalin taught that: One of the minimum requirements of internationalism is that "the victory of socialism in one country is not an end in itself, but an instrument for launching and supporting revolution in other countries."

    The Bolshevik Party, whether in the past or now, has been relentlessly opposed to any manifestation of nationalism, regardless of the form it takes, considering it to be one of the most dangerous manifestations of bourgeois ideology. If the communists in a country where the revolution has already triumphed contrast the national tasks of their own country with the international tasks facing the entire international workers' movement, it would be most beneficial to world imperialism. The result of this opposition would be that the country where the revolution has triumphed would abandon its most reliable allies—the proletariat of the whole world—and thereby weaken itself in the face of world imperialism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always clearly seen the danger of nationalism and has always resolutely fought against it for the sake of the unity of the laborers of all countries.

    The Soviet Union's policy of promoting internationalism has always been a staunch defender of the freedom and independence of all ethnic groups and nationalities, and opposed to national and racial oppression. During the war against fascist Germany, the liberating role of the socialist country was powerfully presented to all mankind. And in those countries liberated by the Soviet army, the working class has gained the opportunity to unite democratic forces, establish people's democratic systems, and move forward along the path of building a socialist society.

    No wonder the close friendship between these countries and the Soviet Union is fundamentally different from the alliances usually concluded between countries. This is a class alliance of laborers, who believe that the mutual cooperation and amity between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union are a major condition for the development and prosperity of the people's democratic countries and a major guarantee for safeguarding their national freedom and independence from imperialist aggression. As a result of the fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union, economic upsurges and socialist victories are taking place in the people's democratic countries on the basis of mutual assistance and close internationalist alliances.

    This is the power of internationalist harmony.

    The case of Yugoslavia shows what results nationalism can bring about and what harm it can cause to the workers' movement.

    After the trial of Rajk and his accomplices in Budapest, the people of the world have seen clearly the degeneration of the Tito-Ranković group from bourgeois nationalism to fascism and the open betrayal of the interests of the Yugoslav nation. The true Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which is being rebuilt in the current struggle against the Tito elements, unites those who are loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism. The trial of Kostov in Bulgaria once again shows that the imperialist camp, both now and in the future, recruits traitors and spies from among those who have been poisoned by the wicked elements of nationalism.

    Comrade Stalin taught that: There is one question that distinguishes all factions, trends, and political parties and tests their revolutionary or counter-revolutionary nature. This is the question of the relationship to the Soviet Union.

    "Only those who unconditionally and unhesitatingly prepare to defend the Soviet Union are internationalists, because the Soviet Union is the base of the world revolutionary movement, and without defending the Soviet Union, one cannot support and promote this revolutionary movement forward. Because whoever opposes the Soviet Union in order to support the world revolutionary movement is bound to roll into the camp of the enemies of the revolution."

    These words of J. Stalin, spoken many years ago, have been repeatedly confirmed by life to be profoundly correct, and the lesson of Yugoslavia shows particularly clearly that any form of nationalism—always serves the interests of imperialism. Only thorough internationalism and its highest expression—namely, actively supporting the Soviet Union—are truly serving the cause of socialism. Stalin's words during the early years of the Soviet regime, "Nationalism—this is the last position that must be seized in order to overthrow the bourgeoisie and ultimately defeat it," have a particularly great appeal today.

    The sense of internationalist duty and the fraternal relations with all peoples and nations have deeply penetrated the minds and bodies of every Communist Party member in the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks—are true internationalists, ardent patriots of their own country, and warriors fighting for the happiness of all ethnic groups in the world and for peace among all ethnic groups.

　　要当共产主义者就必得成为国际主义者
    ·波里索夫·
    所有一切国家的工人，都是一样致力铲除资本主义制度的。他们的利益是一致的。所以各族工人愈加亲密的行动，愈加积极互相帮助，则对于敌人的打击就愈加强烈，共同的胜利就愈加接近。“全世界无产者，联合起来！”——这是马克思和恩格斯在其伟大著作《共产党宣言》上的结束语。而这一号召，已深深浸入了各国无产者的心怀。
    当各国工人致力于接近、联合及各族人民间的和睦共处时，资产阶级则千方百计把劳动者隔开及挑拨他们互相仇视。资产阶级为了使无产阶级离开阶级斗争并把打击转移到别的方面起见，便散布了民族主义的毒恶种子以及煽起民族间的仇视等等。资本主义就是战争，而资产阶级就利用民族主义来挑拨战争。
    列宁说过：“资产阶级的民族主义与无产阶级的国际主义，这是两个不调和的敌对口号，是适合于整个资本主义世界的两大阶级阵营及表示两种政策（尤其是两种宇宙观）”。布尔什维克党在自己的全部历史过程中所实行的政策之特点，便是国际主义。
    要成为国际主义者，这就是说要增进各族人民间的友谊，尊重任何一个民族的劳动者及同一切剥削者作斗争，不管他们是属于那个民族。在联共（布）党的党章上说，党要求自己的党员积极工作，去“巩固苏联各族劳动者间及世界各国无产者间的兄弟般的国际主义关系。”
    共产党人神圣的执行党章上的这一要求。自从伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的最初时日起，布尔什维克就动手来解决民族问题。俄国的共产党人，曾在全国各族人民中间进行工作。他们在各个民族共和国境内建立了工业，帮助发展以社会主义为内容，以民族为形式的文化，耐心的克服了各民族之间的从前的互不信任心理的残余。
    约·斯大林教导说：“民族间的互不信任心理、民族独尊性、民族仇视、民族间的冲突等，当然不是由什么民族憎恶心理来刺激和支持的，而是由帝国主义征服异族的图谋和这些异族在民族奴役威胁下的恐惧心理所刺激和支持的。”
    在苏联境内形成了并巩固起来了的一些社会主义的新民族，都抛弃了民族主义心理而浸透了各族人民间的友谊感及国际主义的意识。
    国际主义并不与民族自豪感相矛盾。国际主义与“民族虚无主义”，是没有共同之点的。约·斯大林教导说：“民族虚无主义只是有害于社会主义事业，替资产阶级民族主义助威”。而实际上帝国主义者用尽一切手段，图谋借世界主义的毒恶思想，来窒息各族人民的民族自尊心理以及消灭其爱国感等。世界主义，这是帝国主义抢劫并奴役各族人民的思想武器。
    不先成为自己祖国的真正爱国者，就不能成为国际主义者，不尊重及珍爱自己本国人民、不为其繁盛和幸福生活而斗争，就不能尊重其他各族人民。布尔什维克之所以实行了社会主义革命，首先是为要解放居住在俄国境内的各族人民。他们是以真正爱国者的资格进行了活动的。列宁、斯大林党始终认为伟大十月社会主义革命，不仅是本国内部的社会变革，而且认为是世界革命的一个组成部分，认为是一个雄强根据地，该根据地应当帮助其他各国劳动者也获得胜利。斯大林同志教导说：国际主义的一个起码要求，就在于“社会主义在一个国家内的胜利并不是自己目的，而是为着在其他各国发动并支掌革命的一种工具。”
    布尔什维克党无论从前或现在，都是无情反对民族主义任何表现的，不管它表现的是什么形态，认为它是资产阶级思想最危险的表现之一。如果某一个革命已经胜利了的国家中的共产党人，来把本国的民族任务同整个国际工人运动前面摆着的国际任务对立起来，那么对于世界帝国主义会是再有利益不过的。这种对立的结果，就会是革命胜利了的这个国家绝弃了自己的最可靠的同盟者——即全世界无产阶级，而以此在世界帝国主义面前削弱自己。苏联共产党始终明显看出了民族主义的危险性，无论从前或现在都是为了各国劳动者间的团结利益而与其作坚决的斗争。
    苏联推行国际主义的政策，始终是各族人民自由及独立的忠实捍卫者，而反对民族压迫及种族的压迫。在对法西斯德国作战时，社会主义国家的解放作用，很有力的呈现到了全人类的面前。而在苏联军队所解放的那些国家内，工人阶级获得了团结民主力量、建立人民民主制度及循着建设社会主义社会道路向前发展的机会。
    无怪乎这些国家同苏联的密切友谊，是与各国间通常缔结的同盟根本不同的。这是劳动者的阶级同盟，他们认为人民民主各国同苏联彼此协合及亲善，是人民民主各国发展及繁荣的一个主要条件，是使其民族自由及独立免遭帝国主义侵犯的一个主要保障。由苏联兄弟般帮助的结果，在互助及密切国际主义同盟的基础上，人民民主各国内发生着经济高涨，社会主义节节胜利。
    这就是国际主义协和的力量。
    以南斯拉夫为例就可看出，民族主义引起什么结果，给工人运动造成什么害处？
    在布达佩斯对拉伊克及其同伙审判案后的现今，全世界人士都看清了铁托——兰柯维奇集团从资产阶级民族主义走上法西斯主义及公然出卖南斯拉夫民族利益的蜕变。在现今同铁托分子斗争中再建起来的南斯拉夫真正共产党，团结那些忠实于无产阶级国际主义旗帜的志士。保加利亚对柯斯托夫的审判案，再次表明帝国主义阵营无论现在或将来，都是从受了民族主义恶毒的分子中间招募卖国贼及间谍的。
    斯大林同志教导说：有一个问题是分别所有一切派别思潮及政党，检验其革命性或反革命性的。这就是对于苏联关系的问题。
    “只有无条件、不犹豫的准备保卫苏联的人才是国际主义者，因为苏联是世界革命运动的根据地，而若不保卫苏联，就不能拥护、推动这种革命运动向前迈进。因为谁若反对苏联来拥护世界革命运动，谁就一定滚到革命之敌的阵营中去。”
    约·斯大林在好多年以前说的这番话，已由生活屡次证实了他这番话的深刻正确性，而南斯拉夫的教训又特别明显的表明，任何形式的民族主义——都始终是替帝国主义的利益服务的。只有彻底的国际主义及其最高表现——即积极拥护苏联——才是忠实替社会主义事业服务的。斯大林同志在苏维埃政权最初年代间所说：“民族主义——这就是为要推翻资产阶级以便最终战胜它所必须夺取的那最后的一处阵地”这段话，在现今的号召力是特别之大。
    国际主义义务感及对一切人民和民族的友爱关系，已深刻的浸入苏联每一名共产党员的心身。布尔什维克——这是真正的国际主义者、自己祖国的热烈爱国者，是为全世界各族人民幸福、为各族人民间和平而奋斗的战士。
