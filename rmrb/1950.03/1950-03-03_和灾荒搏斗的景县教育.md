　　Jing County Education Battles Famine

　　Jing County is a county in southern Hebei Province with a relatively good foundation in education. According to statistics from last summer (before the flood), the county had more than 800 administrative villages: 524 junior primary schools (18 of which were attached with fifth-grade classes), 26 senior primary schools and complete primary schools; with a total of 842 primary school teachers. Last year, Jing County suffered a severe flood, with most of the county's land submerged. The people's lives were difficult, and public grain income was sharply reduced, bringing great difficulties to the primary school education that was being reorganized. However, the county's educators were not intimidated by the difficulties. On the contrary, under the principle of combining education with production and disaster relief work, they launched a heroic struggle against the famine, enabling 87 percent of the county's junior primary schools, all senior primary schools, and 11 junior primary schools with attached fifth-grade classes to continue classes (the number of students enrolled was about three-quarters of that before the disaster), and improving teaching efficiency. Primary schools in lightly affected areas have embarked on the road to regularization.

　　　　　　Leadership Measures

　　After the flood, there was a period of ideological confusion among primary school teachers in Jing County. The leadership promptly carried out rectification and mobilization, calling on the people's teachers to share weal and woe with the elders of Jing County and to carry forward their spirit of hard struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This made ideological preparations for reducing the standard of living and persisting in disaster-period education, and enabled the county's schools to successfully overcome the difficulties brought about by the sudden attack of the disaster.

　　Before the autumn vacation, each district insisted on centralized examinations for junior and senior primary school students in each district, and held a county-wide primary school teacher test, also on a district basis. At the beginning of the vacation, each district held a summary meeting and elected model primary schools and model teachers. The leadership also investigated the different situations in lightly affected areas, semi-severely affected areas, and severely affected areas, and studied how education should be carried out after autumn.

　　During the autumn vacation, the plan to improve the quality of teachers was still implemented in the water-surrounded county seat. Centralized learning was held for all senior primary school teachers and 87 model junior primary school teachers. In addition to studying business and exchanging experience, special discussions were held on how to combine education with production and disaster relief to solve the actual difficulties of students so that children in severely affected areas could attend school.

　　Before the winter semester started, a county-wide meeting of education cadres was held. In order to reduce expenses, preserve teachers, and continue to complete the plan to rotate teachers, the meeting decided to transfer 120 primary school teachers to Jing County Normal School for study, with each person receiving 50 jin of millet per month to maintain their livelihood; the salary standards of on-the-job teachers were also temporarily reduced. It was also decided to merge some of the primary schools in the severely affected areas (Districts 1, 5, and 10) in a planned way, and transfer the remaining teachers to non-disaster areas; the same principle was followed for self-adjustment in the semi-severely affected areas. At this meeting, the education cadres in each district recalled that during the great famine of 1943, in the tense struggle environment with the Japanese invaders, teachers only received 45 jin of millet per month but still insisted on teaching; the current situation was far less serious than at that time, and everyone believed that the difficulties could be overcome.

　　　　　　Hardworking and Outstanding People's Teachers

　　After the winter semester started, in disaster-stricken areas, many teachers actively helped the masses to produce and save themselves, and mobilized their children to go to school. Some organized students to collect leaves in the morning, pick up firewood in the morning, and study in the afternoon; others organized students into groups to pick up sweet potatoes and peanuts in non-disaster areas, and then the teachers provided remedial lessons. Some students in Chengguan Primary School went to school early on market days. After the teacher finished the lesson, they returned at ten in the morning to help their fathers and brothers with small businesses or repair shoes. The teachers of Houtun Primary School in District 1 discussed with the masses the time for students to help their families with work. They studied in the morning and evening, and returned to sweep nitre soil from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. This solved the contradiction between production and learning for many students.

　　Many teachers' lives and work are extremely difficult, but they have made good achievements.

　　Wang Zhaohua, a first-class model teacher in District 1 who won an award in the previous semester, was assigned to teach at Zhangqizhuang Primary School, which was the most severely affected by the disaster. Because students from three nearby villages merged into the school, he taught seven classes by himself, with 78 students (later increased to 95). He ordered a composite curriculum for seven grades, used the small teacher system to help teach, without confusion or idleness. He and the small teachers carried forward the spirit of democratic management, so that the students consciously abide by discipline, and all learning and activities are very regular. He also tried to improve the learning environment. On the walls of the classroom, which was no more than seven feet high, narrow and simple, he painted two maps of the world and China, as well as pictures of production and disaster relief, farmers' labor, and children's games. He also wrote eye-catching slogans: "Tighten your belts and stare, persist in disaster famine education." This encouraged himself and the children who were eating bran and vegetables. In order to understand the level of students in the school, the Jing County Education Section sent four or five cadres to the school for a temporary test. It was found that the students in each class had very good grades; their usual homework was also excellent.

　　Many teachers became ill due to overwork but did not leave their posts: for example, Wang Guozhen, a teacher at Xiaoliuzhuang in District 1, taught abacus to the masses until 12:00 pm. After the masses left, he had to prepare lessons, which caused him to develop a brain disease but he still insisted on working. Wang Ligong, a teacher in Balipu, could not walk due to sores on his legs, and was carried to the classroom by students to give lectures. In the severely affected areas, some teachers could not receive their living expenses in time, but they worked with peace of mind without any complaints: for example, Wang Mengxian, a teacher in Zhou Guozhuang in District 1, ran 20 miles home at night to carry grain, and arrived at school the next morning without delaying the students' studies. Han Gengyi, a teacher in Duqiao, persisted in teaching by eating only one meal a day, which moved the students, and they borrowed grain for the teacher one after another. Some teachers took out their own salaries to help the school in times of difficulty: for example, Chen Zhentang, a teacher in District 6, donated 100 jin of wheat in the summer of last year to repair the school, and after the disaster, he automatically took out six boxes of stone pencils and twelve small brushes as prizes to encourage students to make progress.

　　All the senior primary school teachers in the county have made significant improvements in their professional skills and work attitude after studying during the autumn vacation. In the difficult environment, teachers and students ate from the same pot, and some only ate two meals of millet porridge every day. But the teachers still worked hard to improve teaching effectiveness. For example, in order to help day students study, most of the senior primary schools in the county organized night self-study groups according to the villages where the students lived, and teachers went to inspect at night, which improved the results of day students.

　　Among the faculty and staff of Jing County Normal School, there are old educators in their fifties and sixties, who are engaged in work and study with a nervous and happy attitude with a living standard of 60 jin of millet per month.

　　At present, the county's educators have just completed the work competition and mutual visits between districts, and are holding exhibitions, observation meetings, and appraising teachers and selecting models. It is estimated that there will be an even more serious famine this spring, but everyone is confident that they can overcome this difficulty and move towards the final victory in defeating the famine.

　　As for the ninth district and part of the eighth district, where the disaster is relatively light, the primary schools have embarked on the road to regularization. The enrollment rate of boys has reached 95%, and the enrollment rate of girls is about 50% to 60%. The social education in District 9 is also generally good. There are 41 winter schools in the district, with 3,895 students. Here, we can see the prospect of education in the county after the wheat harvest this year.

### 和灾荒搏斗的景县教育

　　和灾荒搏斗的景县教育
    景县是河北省南部教育工作基础比较好的县份。全县八百多个行政村，据去年夏季（水灾前）统计：有初小五百二十四处（内十八处附设有五年级班），高小、完小二十六处；小学教员共八百四十二名。去年景县遭受了严重的水灾，全县土地大部被淹，群众生活艰苦，公粮收入锐减，给正在整顿中的小学教育带来了极大的困难。但是，全县教育工作者并未被困难所吓倒；相反地，他们在教育与生产救灾工作结合进行的原则下，与灾荒展开了英勇的斗争，使全县百分之八十七的初小，全部高小和十一处初小附设的五年级班一直坚持上课（入学学生人数约及灾前的四分之三），并提高了教学效率；轻灾区的小学则走上了正规化的道路。
            领导上的措施
    在水灾后，景县各地小学教员思想上曾有一度混乱。领导上及时进行了整顿、动员，号召人民教师要与景县父老同甘共苦，发扬自己在抗战期间的艰苦奋斗精神。这样，为降低生活水平，坚持灾期教育作了思想准备，并使当时全县学校胜利地克服了灾荒突然袭击所带来的困难。
    放秋假前，各区坚持了初、高小学生分区集中的会考，并以区为单位举行了全县小学教员测验。放假时各区开了总结大会，选举了模范小学及模范教师。领导上并分别调查了轻灾、半重灾和重灾区的各种不同情况，研究了秋后教育工作应如何进行。
    秋假期间，在水围的县城里，依旧执行了提高师资的计划。分别举办了全部高小教师和八十七名模范初小教师的集中学习。除研究业务、交流经验之外，并特别讨论了如何使教育与生产救灾结合，以解决学生的实际困难，使重灾区的儿童能够入学。
    冬季开学前，召开了全县教育干部会议。为了减少开支、保存师资，并继续完成轮训教师的计划，会上决议抽调小学教员一百二十人入景县师范学校学习，每人每月以五十斤小米的供给维持生活；在职教员的薪金标准亦暂时降低。并决定将重灾区（一、五、十区）的小学有计划地合并一部分，将所余教员调往非灾区工作；在半重灾区中则依此原则自行调整。在此次会议上，各区教育干部回想起一九四三年大灾荒时，在与日寇的紧张斗争环境中，教员每人每月仅领四十五斤小米仍坚持了教学；现在的情况远不如当时严重，大家相信：困难一定能够克服。
            艰苦卓绝的人民教师
    冬季开学以后，在灾重地区，许多教师积极帮助群众生产自救，动员其子女上学。有的组织学生早晨搂树叶，上午拾柴，下午学习；有的则将学生编成小组，到非灾区去拾红薯、拾花生，回来后由教员补课。城关小学一部分学生每逢集日提早入校，教员讲完课后，上午十点回去帮助父兄作小买卖或补鞋等工作。一区后屯小学教员与群众商定学生帮助家庭工作的时间，每日早晨及傍晚学习，上午十点到下午三点回去扫硝土。这样解决了很多学生生产与学习的矛盾。
    许多教师的生活和工作都是极端艰苦的，但他们作出了很好的成绩。
    一区去年上期得奖的甲等模范教师王兆华，本期被派往灾情最重的张奇庄小学教课。由于附近三个小村的学生并入该校，他一个人教七个班次，学生七十八人（后增至九十五人）。他订制了七个年级的复式课程表，运用小先生制帮助教学，不紊乱，也不空闲。他和小先生们发扬了民主管理的精神，使学生们自觉地遵守纪律，一切学习和活动都很正规。他又想法改进了学习环境，在高不过七尺、狭小简陋的教室墙壁上，画上两幅世界和中国地图，还有生产渡荒、农民劳动和儿童游戏的图画。并写上引人注目的标语：“紧腰瞪眼，坚持灾荒教育”。以此鼓励自己，也鼓励吃糠咽菜的孩子们。景县教育科为了了解该校学生程度，曾派四、五个干部到该校进行了临时测验。发现各班学生的成绩都很好；平时作业也很优异。
    许多教员因劳成病仍不脱离岗位：如一区小刘庄教员王国贞晚上教群众的珠算直到夜十二时，群众走后还要预备功课，累成了脑病还坚持工作。八里铺教员王立功腿上长疮不能走路，由学生抬到课堂上去讲书。在重灾区，有的教师不能及时领到生活费用，也毫无怨言地安心工作：如一区周郭庄教员王梦贤，晚上跑二十里路回家去背粮食，第二天早晨赶到学校，不耽误学生的学习。杜桥教员韩庚义每天吃一顿饭坚持着教学，感动了学生，他们纷纷借粮给老师。有的教员在困难中自己拿出薪金帮助学校：如六区教员陈振棠，在去年夏季中捐麦一百斤修整校舍，灾后又自动拿出六盒石笔和十二枝小楷作为奖品，鼓励学生进步。
    全县各高级小学教员，经过秋假中的学习，在业务上和工作态度上都有显著改进。在困难的环境中，教员与学生在一个锅里吃饭，有的每天只吃两顿小米粥。但教师们仍努力提高教学效果。例如为了帮助走读生学习，全县绝大部分高小都按学生居住的村庄组织了夜间自习小组，教员夜晚去巡视。提高了走读生的成绩。
    景县师范的教职员中，有五、六十岁的老教育工作者，他们以每月六十斤小米的生活标准，紧张愉快地从事工作和学习。
    目前，全县教育工作者刚结束了工作竞赛和区与区之间的互相参观，又在举行展览会、观摩会及鉴定教员、评选模范等工作。估计今春还有一段更严重的灾荒，但大家都有信心突破这一难关，向战胜灾荒的最后胜利迈进。
    至于灾情较轻的第九区全部和八区一部村庄，小学已走上了正规化的道路。男生入学者已达百分之九十五，女生入学者约百分之五、六十。九区的社会教育一般也很好，全区有冬学四十一处，学员达三八九五人。在这里，我们可以看到今年麦收后全县教育工作的前景。
