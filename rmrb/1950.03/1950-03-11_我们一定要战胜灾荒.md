　　We Must Conquer the Famine
    Xie Juezai, Minister of the Interior of the Central People's Government

    Last year, many regions in our country suffered natural disasters. The disasters in some regions, such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Hebei, and Pingyuan, were very severe. The people and cadres in the disaster areas, having just won a long and arduous struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, are now fighting against famine. From drought-resistant planting, catching pests, reinforcing dikes, rushing to save the embankments, draining water to plant wheat, developing sideline occupations, practicing thrift and mutual assistance, issuing emergency relief grain, and adjusting grain supplies, they have victoriously passed through a stage of the famine after a series of amazing and arduous work.

    At present, we are facing the serious stage of the spring famine. Our method of overcoming the famine remains: on the one hand, each disaster area will launch a production self-salvation movement, and a mass social mutual assistance and mutual relief movement will be launched within the disaster areas and between the disaster areas and non-disaster areas; on the other hand, the people's government, even under today's relatively difficult financial conditions, will still allocate a considerable amount of grain for disaster victims to engage in production, work relief, and emergency relief. Our cadres and people not only have experience in fighting against domestic and foreign enemies, but also have experience in fighting against famine over the years. We have absolute confidence in overcoming the current famine. The people in the disaster areas say: "In the Kuomintang era, we were afraid of famine and starvation. Today, with the Communist Party and the People's Government helping us find solutions, we can always get through it." Although the people in the disaster areas are living in extreme hardship, their political mood is still normal and social order is still peaceful.

    However, being able to overcome the famine does not mean that the famine is not serious. The number of people lacking or without food in the severely affected areas still reaches several million. They are eating bran and wild vegetables. The houses destroyed by the floods have not been repaired, and there is a great shortage of farming tools and seeds. They need relief and help. Any negligence in the disaster relief work may cause trouble and be guilty of neglecting the issue of the life and death of the people.

    To overcome the spring famine, the people in the disaster areas need to launch the production self-salvation movement more deeply and universally than in the past. Everyone should think of ways and every household should make plans to engage in various types of sideline production. The spring plowing season is approaching, and with the assistance of the government, we must overcome various difficulties in production and plant the land. We must solve the current hunger problem and pay attention to the spring plowing production, so that sideline production and agricultural production are closely integrated. We must promote the spirit of friendship and solidarity among the people in the disaster areas, organize ourselves in production, cooperate and help each other, and implement local mutual assistance as much as possible, with neighbors helping each other, to make up for the insufficient support from other places and emergency relief from the government.

    The people in non-disaster areas should work hard to produce and save, and support the disaster areas. The people in the cities should support the farmers in the disaster areas. During the long revolutionary struggle, the peasant compatriots contributed people and grain to support the front lines. Their contributions are very great and their merits are particularly great. Without the peasants, there would be no liberated cities today. Many urban people deeply understand this meaning and have launched a disaster relief fundraising campaign. Some cities are still in progress, and this righteous act is worthy of praise. We hope that the urban people will continue to promote the spirit of friendship and enthusiastically respond to the fundraising and disaster relief campaign. Only when the rural areas overcome the famine and gradually achieve abundance can the cities recover faster.

    Personnel in government agencies and military units should universally launch a savings and disaster relief movement. In order to relieve the famine, unnecessary or fewer expenses can be avoided. Many local government agency personnel are calling on each person to save two ounces of rice per day. Military units that have no combat missions for the time being are calling on each person to save one ounce of rice per day, which is worth responding to enthusiastically. Although the lives of personnel in government agencies and military units are difficult today, when we think of the hardworking disaster victims who are not even able to eat their fill of bran, vegetables, and tree leaves, it is nothing for each of us to save one, two, or three ounces of rice per day. The grain saved by one person in two or three days can be enough for a disaster victim to survive for one day. Our government agencies have been saving an ounce of rice for half a year, and we should continue to do so until the famine is over. Not only should personnel in government agencies and military units do this, but also the people in non-disaster areas should do this. Accumulating little makes a mickle, which will greatly support the disaster victims.

    Party and government personnel and people's organization personnel in the disaster areas should concentrate their efforts to lead disaster relief and lead the people to fight against the famine. We must be as tenacious and firm as we were in the past in leading the people to deal with domestic and foreign enemies, highly promote the spirit of being responsible to the people, go deep into the disaster areas, face the disaster victims, effectively grasp the disaster situation, encourage the confidence of the disaster victims, and promote various creations. Through the people's representative conferences at all levels, turn the central government's disaster relief guidelines and slogans into the disaster-stricken people's own guidelines and slogans. Turn the disaster relief work plans of the leaders at all levels into the plans of every household and every person in the disaster areas. The situation caused by the natural disaster is another test for the cadres in the disaster areas. Our people's government cadres have been able to withstand the test in the past, and they will still be able to withstand the test today.

    Overcoming the famine depends on our work, depends on the coordination of our departments' work on disaster relief, and depends on the cadres at all levels who are doing the work. Now the Central Disaster Relief Committee has been established, which will better promote disaster relief work in various disaster-stricken areas. As long as we implement the central government's disaster relief work guidelines and do our job well, we will definitely be able to overcome the famine.

　　我们一定要战胜灾荒
    中央人民政府内务部部长  谢觉哉
    去年我国不少地区遭受了天灾，有几个地区的灾情如苏北、皖北、河北、平原是很严重的。灾区的人民和干部，于对国内外敌人作长期残酷斗争刚获胜利之后，又和灾荒作斗争，从抗旱点种、捕捉害虫、上堤抢险、排水种麦、发展副业、节约互助、发急赈粮调剂粮等一系列的惊人艰苦的工作，已经胜利地渡过了灾荒的一个阶段。
    目下是面临着春荒的严重阶段。我们战胜灾荒的方法，仍然是：一方面，各个灾区展开生产自救运动，灾区内部和灾区与非灾区间展开群众性的社会互助互济运动；另一方面，人民政府即使在今天财政比较困难的情况下，也还拿出为数颇巨的粮食用在灾民生产，以工代赈和紧急救济上。我们的干部和人民，不止有和国内外敌人作斗争的经验，也有历年来和灾荒作斗争的经验，我们有绝对把握渡过目前的灾荒。灾区的人民说：“在国民党时代，我们怕灾荒，怕饿死，今天有共产党和人民政府帮助想办法，总能过得去。”灾区人民虽然过着极端困苦的生活，政治情绪还是正常的，社会秩序还是安宁的。
    但是灾荒能够渡过，并不等于灾荒不严重。重灾区缺粮或无粮的人数尚达数百万，他们吃的是糠麸野菜，被水冲毁的房屋没修复，耕具种子很不够，他们需要救济，需要帮助。任何对救灾工作的疏忽，都可能闹出乱子，要犯忽视有关人民生死问题的罪恶。
    灾区的人民要渡过春荒，需要把生产自救运动比过去更深入普遍地展开。要人人想办法，户户作计划，从事各式各样的副业生产。春耕时节即快到来，要在政府的扶助下，克服各种生产中的困难，把地种上。要解决当前的饥饿问题，同时要注意春耕生产问题，使副业生产与农业生产密切地结合起来。要发扬灾区人民患难同舟的友爱精神，在生产上组织起来，合作互助，并尽可能地实行就地互济，亲邻相帮，以补外地支援和政府急救之不足。
    非灾区的人民要努力生产节约，支援灾区，城市人民要支援灾区的农民。农民同胞在长期革命斗争中，出人出粮，支援前线，贡献非常多，功劳特别大，没有农民就没有今天解放了的城市。许多城市人民，深明此义，已经发动过救灾募捐运动，有的城市现时仍在进行中，这种义举是值得表扬的。我们希望城市人民继续发扬友爱精神，热烈响应募捐救灾运动。只有农村战胜了灾荒，逐渐达到丰足，城市才能更快地恢复起来。
    机关部队人员要普遍地掀起节约救灾运动。为了救济灾荒，花钱的事情，不必要的可以不办或少办。许多地方机关人员正在号召每人每日节约二两米。暂无作战任务的部队正在号召每人每日节约一两米，这是值得热烈响应的。今日机关部队人员的生活虽是艰苦，但一想到勤劳的灾民，吃糠菜树叶还不能饱的状况，那我们每人每日节省一两、二两或三两米算不了什么。而一个人两天或三天所节约下来的粮食，却可以够一个灾民渡命一天。我们政府机关一两米节约，已进行了半年，现仍应继续进行，至灾荒渡过为止。不仅机关部队人员应这样作，非灾区的人民也应这样作。集腋成裘，对灾民将起很大的支援作用。
    灾区的党政人员和人民团体人员应集中力量，领导救灾，领导人民对灾荒作斗争。要像过去领导人民对付国内外敌人一样的顽强坚定，高度发扬为人民负责的精神，深入灾区，面向灾民，切实掌握灾情，鼓舞灾民信心，发扬各种创造。通过各界人民代表会议，把中央救灾工作的方针口号，变为灾区群众自己的方针口号。把各级领导上的救灾工作计划，变为灾区群众每户每人的计划。天灾造成的局面，对灾区的干部又是一番考验。我们人民政府的干部，过去是经得起考验的，今天仍然会经得起考验。
    渡过灾荒，决定于我们的工作，决定于我们各部门工作对救灾的配合，决定于作工作的各级干部。现在中央救灾委员会已经成立，将更好地推动各有灾地区的救灾工作。只要我们贯彻中央救灾工作方针，把工作作好，我们是一定能够战胜灾荒的。
