　　Be Sure to Run the Circular Route Well
　　Tram Company Communications Group Han Zhenxing

　　In order to complete the 1950 operation plan, the Beijing Tram Company has decided to change its routes from March 16th, merging the existing three routes of East Third Road (Beixinqiao to Xuanwumen), West Third Road (Pinganli to Chongwenmen), and Fourth Road (Pinganli to Beixinqiao) into a circular route, divided into an inner ring road and an outer ring road. The inner ring starts from Pinganli, goes east through Di'anmen, Beixinqiao, Dongsi, Dongdan, Tiananmen, Beikou, Xidan, and Xisi, and ends at Pinganli. The outer ring starts from Pinganli, goes south through Xisi, Xidan, Beikou, Tiananmen, Dongdan, Dongsi, Beixinqiao, and Di'anmen, and ends at Pinganli.

　　Why run a circular route? Because it can connect traffic from all directions, reduce the time trams are idle at terminals, avoid route overlaps, shorten travel intervals, facilitate passengers, and reduce the hassle and waiting time for passengers traveling from the south city to the north city or from the east city to the west city. More importantly, it concentrates the use of vehicles and strengthens trunk line operations. Therefore, whether from the perspective of developing production tasks or from the perspective of streamlining and economizing, changing to a circular route is a good method for scientific operation.

　　In the past, the tram company also ran a circular route, which was forcibly implemented by bureaucratic capitalists. They treated workers like cattle and horses, causing excessive mental and physical fatigue. Therefore, at that time, the workers launched a struggle against the capitalists, driving the trams to the Fourth Road to "play hide-and-seek." Because the Fourth Road was a single track, they used the time of meeting other trams at switches to rest or eat, so most of the trams concentrated on the Fourth Road. The double-track sections and densely populated areas, on the other hand, had no trams. At the same time, the transformers in the North Substation, because of the concentration of vehicles on the Fourth Road, could not be driven by the rollers, resulting in tripping and power outages, which delayed the tram schedule. So at that time, the change was made three or four times, but it was not successful.

　　After liberation, based on the general improvement of the workers' political consciousness, the plan to implement the circular route began to brew in early December of last year. At the same time, the Repair Factory, Power Supply Section, and Civil Engineering Section all gave considerable guarantees: completing the overhaul of vehicles in advance, strengthening maintenance work, inspecting transformers and lines, and inspecting road rails and switches. Based on the assistance of the above factories and sections, joint meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, as well as joint meetings of various factories, sections, and tram routes, were held successively on December 23rd of last year and January 6th of this year to solicit opinions and conduct detailed discussions on relevant issues. Administratively, everyone was mobilized to think of solutions. At the commendation meeting held on the 13th, Comrade Wang Zhenwu, the manager, explained in detail to everyone that this time, running the circular route was based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the administration had also formulated a detailed plan, and called on everyone: We must do well what the Kuomintang failed to do; the workers were in high spirits, and five or six crew teams immediately signed up to participate in running the circular route, and swore to guarantee running the circular route well.

　　The existing two-shift crew teams have been changed to three-shift system, shortening working hours, formulating tram schedules, and deciding to allocate 22 vehicles, that is, 11 for the outer ring and 11 for the inner ring, with an interval of seven minutes for each vehicle. The entire ring takes 77 minutes, and two trams can pass through the repeated route every seven minutes.

### 一定走好环行路

　　一定走好环行路
    电车公司通讯组  韩振兴
    北京市电车公司为了完成一九五○年运营计划，定自三月十六日起更改路线，将现行的东三路（北新桥至宣武门），西三路（平安里至崇文门），四路（平安里至北新桥）等三条路线合并，改为环行路，分为内环路及外环路。内环是从平安里起东行经地安门、北新桥、东四、东单、天安门、北口、西单、西四到平安里止。外环是从平安里起南行经西四、西单、北口、天安门、东单、东四、北新桥、地安门到平安里止。
    为什么要走环行路？因为它能连贯四面交通，减少首末站固挂车的时间，避免路线重叠，缩短行车间隔，便利乘客，使乘客减少由南城到北城或由东城到西城的换车之烦及候车之苦；更为了集中使用车辆，加强干线运营，因此无论是从发展生产任务上，或者是从精简节约上看，改环行路却是走向科学运营的好方法。
    过去电车公司也走过环行路，是由官僚资本家们强制工人实行的。他们把工人看成了牛马，使工人在精神上、体力上，都遭到了过度的劳累，所以那时工友便对资本家展开斗争，都将车子开到四路去“捉迷藏”。因为四路是单轨，借着在岔道错车等车的时间来休息或吃饭，因此多半数的车子集中到四路。双轨处及人口紧密的地区反倒没有了车子。同时北变流厂的变电器因为车辆的集中四路，滚子带不动，即发生跳闸、没电的现象，延误行车时刻。所以在那时候改了有三、四回都没走好。
    解放后，基于工友的政治觉悟普遍提高，于去年十二月初即开始酝酿实现环行路计划。同时修造厂、供电课、土木课等都给了相当的保证：提前完成大修车辆，加强检修工作，检修变电机和线路，检修路轨和岔道。根据上面各厂课援助，于去年十二月二十三日及今年一月六日，先后召开党政工团联席会，及各厂课、车路联席会，征询意见，详细研讨了有关问题。行政上更发动了大家想办法。在十三日召开的评奖大会上，经理王镇武同志更详细地向大家解释了这次走环行路是根据苏联专家的建议，行政上也已制订了周密的计划，并号召大家：国民党没搞好的我们一定要搞好；工友们情绪极高，当场就有五、六个乘务小组报名参加走环行路，并宣誓保证走好环行。
    现有的乘务小组原系两班制已改为三班制，缩短了工作时间，制定行车时刻，并决定配备车辆二十二部，即外环十一部，内环十一部，每部间隔七分钟，全环共行七十七分，重复之路线内每七分钟可有二部车经过。
