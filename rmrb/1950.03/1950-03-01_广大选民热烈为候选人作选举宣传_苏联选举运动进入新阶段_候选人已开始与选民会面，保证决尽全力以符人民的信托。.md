　　Broad Electorate Warmly Campaigning for Candidates
    Soviet Election Movement Enters New Stage
    Candidates Have Begun Meeting with Voters, Vowing to Do Their Utmost to Live Up to the People's Trust.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th] Comprehensive TASS report: Voters in various electoral districts of the Soviet Union have begun holding gatherings with the candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union nominated by them since late February. The working people of the Shcherbakov electoral district met with their representative candidate, Rossiysky, the renowned foreman of the "Kalibr" factory. Rossiysky assured the voters that if elected, he would do his utmost to live up to the great trust the people have placed in him.
    The Frunze electoral district also held a mass meeting for Martyanova, the representative candidate nominated by the district, who has devoted more than 50 years to the cause of public education.
    Seven hundred representatives from factories, manufacturers, and institutions in the Oktyabr electoral district met with their representative candidate, Bykov, a Stakhanovite coal miner.
    The Soviet electoral district held a gathering for their representative, Nesmeyanov, the president of Moscow University and academician of the Academy of Sciences.
    Voter representatives from the Lenin district warmly welcomed their candidate for representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Vavilov, president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Vavilov declared that he would do his utmost to live up to the trust the working people have placed in him.
    The Pravda published an editorial on the 27th stating: The election committees in various districts have completed the registration of candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. A new stage has unfolded in the election movement—the stage of campaigning for the candidates of the Stalinist Party and the non-Party alliance. When nominating candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Communists and non-Party people demonstrated extraordinary harmony and unity, and now, they are preparing to vote for their common candidates on election day with the same harmony and unity. Now, the representative candidates have begun to meet with their voters. In these gatherings, representatives of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals are enthusiastically campaigning for the candidates of the Stalinist Party and the non-Party alliance. These gatherings have become moving demonstrations of the entire people's loyalty to the Party of Lenin and Stalin and their unanimous support for the candidates of the Party and non-Party alliance.
