Farmers in Shuanghuaishu Village, Western Suburbs of Beijing, Complete Spring Planting Preparations; Confident of a 10% Increase in Production

[This Newspaper] Following land reform, the farmers of Shuanghuaishu administrative village in the western suburbs of Beijing are actively engaged in various production efforts. Judging from the production preparations already completed in this village, there is great confidence in the Beijing Municipal People's Government's proposed goal of a 10% increase in agricultural production for 1950.

Shuanghuaishu administrative village consists of twelve natural villages, with a total of 590 agricultural households and an agricultural population of 2,661. It has 4,187 mu of dry land and 1,824 mu of paddy land. During the land reform, 40 feudal landlord households were eliminated, and the farmers were distributed 1,534 mu of dry land, 541 mu of paddy land, 52 head of draught animals, 39 carts, 59 waterwheels, 2,294 ordinary farm implements, and 53,643 catties of grain. The number of Farmers' Association members has grown to 1,194.

A new atmosphere of production prevails throughout the village. Last autumn, two-thirds of the village's land was planted with wheat, and the wheat seedlings are now growing lush and green. In front of every household's door and in the open spaces are piles of ditch mud and dried manure. According to the farmers, the village will apply more than 60% more fertilizer this year than in previous years, mainly ditch mud. Zhang Rong and three other households in Zhanghua Village, who were allocated 30 mu of land and a cart, hauled a total of 370 cartloads of ditch mud, each cart carrying 1,700 catties, totaling approximately 629,000 catties. Zhang Rong said happily: "In the past, poor people longed for land but couldn't get it. Now that we have land, how can we not put our energy into work and mud?!" Of the 1,534 mu of dry land allocated to the village's farmers, more than two-tenths have been converted into paddy land. For example, Liu Qi dug a canal more than two zhang long in the three mu of dry land he was allocated, using the original landlord's well to convert it into paddy land. Middle peasant Wang Gui bought a waterwheel and converted seven mu of dry land into paddy land. Landlord He Shouzhe also converted the six mu of dry land left to him into paddy land. The three monks at Guandi Temple renovated the six mu of land left to them, building a sunny greenhouse and turning it into a vegetable garden. Several Party and League members who attended the enlarged cadre meeting in the suburbs of the city have returned to the village and organized mutual aid teams for labor exchange. Zhang Wenqi and three other households, who were allocated a draught animal, two plows, and a cart during the land reform, formed a mutual aid team for labor exchange on this basis. They have established specific methods for recording work points, repairing farm tools, and so on. The village's farmers have great confidence in achieving a 10% increase in production this year.

Currently, there are two urgent problems that need to be addressed in Shuanghuaishu Village's production work: 1. Seed problem: mainly broad bean seeds. Broad beans and corn have always been intercropped in paddy fields. Broad beans mature early, yield high, and can be harvested two months after planting during the Qingming Festival. Each mu of broad beans can yield 100 catties, equivalent to two to three shi of corn. Each mu of land can also yield one shi and five dou of corn. However, each catty of broad bean seeds now costs 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and one mu of land requires 15 catties, which some poor people cannot afford. 2. Livestock breeding problem: During the land reform, the farmers were allocated 52 head of livestock, with each head allocated to three to five households. Except for a few animals that are well-fed and cared for due to sufficient feed, most of the animals are emaciated, and two old animals have already died. There are many reasons for this, such as: farmers lack capital, cannot afford fodder, livestock have no way to earn money, and several households do not provide adequate care. Currently, three households have voluntarily given up their ownership because the livestock are already too thin. These problems will be mainly resolved by relying on the strength of the masses themselves and brainstorming solutions at the upcoming farmers' representative meeting of the entire administrative village.

　　京西双槐树村农民完成春耕准备
    增产一成大有信心
    【本报讯】土地改革后的京西双槐树行政村的农民，正积极进行各项生产工作。从这村已完成的生产准备成绩来看，对京市人民政府所提出的一九五○年农业增产一成的计划，使人充满了无限的信心。
    双槐树行政村由十二个自然村组成，共有五九○农业户口，农业人口二、六六一人，旱地四一八七亩，水地一八二四亩。土地改革中，消灭了四○户封建地主，分得旱地一五三四亩，水地五四一亩，耕畜五二头，大车三九辆，水车五九挂，普通农具二二九四件，粮食五三、六四三斤。农会会员发展到一一九四名。
    全村到处呈现着生产新气象。去秋全村三分之二的土地种上了麦子，现在麦苗长得绿油油的。家家户户的门前和空场上堆满了沟泥和粪干。据农民们说：今年全村要比往年多施肥六成以上，其中主要是沟泥。张化村张荣等四户，分了土地三十亩，一套车。他们共拉了三七○车沟泥，每车一七○○斤，合计约六二九、○○○斤。张荣高兴地说：往年穷人盼地得不到地，今年分了地怎么能不拿出劲来干活泥？！全村农民分得的旱地一五三四亩中，已有十分之二以上改成了水地。如刘琪在分得的三亩旱地中修了二丈多长的一道渠，利用原有地主的水井改成了水地。中农王贵买了一架水车将七亩旱地改为水地。地主何守志也将留给他的六亩旱地改成了水地。关帝庙的三个和尚，将留给他们的六亩地，修起阳畦改成菜园了。参加市郊扩大干部会议的几个党团员，回村后已组织起变工互助组。张文起等四户，土地改革中分得一头牲口、二张犁、一辆大车，在这个基础上成立了变工互助组。他们规定了记工、修理农具等具体办法。全村农民对今年增产一成的信心很高。
    目前双槐树村生产工作中，有两个问题急需解决：一、种籽问题：主要是扁豆籽。水地的扁豆和玉米一向是插杂种植的。扁豆熟的早，产量大，清明下种过两月即可摘收。每亩扁豆可收一○○斤，合玉米二至三石。每亩地又可打玉米一石五斗。但现在每斤扁豆籽需五、六千元，一亩地要十五斤，有些贫苦群众无力购买。二、牲口饲养问题：土地改革中农民分得了五十二头牲口，每头分给了三至五户，除有少数牲口因饲料充足、照料及时养得较好外，多数牲口是喂瘦了，且有两头老牲口已死掉。原因很多，如：农民垫本缺乏，拿不出草料，牲口没有赚钱的路，几户共有照管不够等。现在有三户已自动放弃所有权，因牲口已瘦得不成样子了。这些问题，在行将召开的全行政村的农民代表会议上，将主要依靠群众自己的力量与想办法予以解决。
