The "Sino-Soviet Friendship" monthly magazine, edited by the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, has published its fifth issue. This issue contains seven articles in the "March 8th Women's Day Special Issue," mainly introducing the participation of Soviet women in national political power construction, economic construction, and scientific construction. There are also two impressions of the visit to China by the delegation of Soviet cultural and artistic workers and five impressions of Chinese comrades visiting the Soviet Union. The essays include "Socialism and Individuality" and "The Morality of the Bourgeoisie and the Morality of Socialism," among others. To celebrate the 60th birthday of Vyacheslav Molotov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, this issue features Zhang Zhongshi's article "Molotov's Life and Career" and six related photographs of Molotov.

The second volume, first issue of "Literary Gazette" will be published on March 25th. The main focus of this issue is on film issues. Chen Bo'er's "The Work of Directors and Writers in the Transition of Feature Films from Non-existence to Existence" discusses the growth and future of the new China's film industry. There are three translated articles discussing the experience of Soviet film work, and one article reports on rural film activities. There is also a critical article on the theme of the recently staged "Invisible Front." Particularly noteworthy for readers are Belinsky's "On the Nationality of Literature" and the three articles from the Soviet Literary Gazette, Simonov, and Surkov discussing "Moscow Character." These articles have very important enlightenment and educational significance for China's current literary creation and criticism work. Tian Jian's novella "Photograph of Breaking Bowls" begins serialization in this issue, with a total of sixteen chapters and approximately 40,000 words. The text includes illustrations by Lou Shuang. In addition, there are many literary correspondences and experiences from troops and factories, as well as "Random Notes on Reading Manuscripts," etc.
