　　[This newspaper dispatch] In coordination with suburban production to overcome hardship, the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank of Beijing Branch began issuing loans for early-maturing crop seeds on March 1st through various suburban offices, in order to meet the urgent need of suburban farmers lacking such crop seeds for timely planting. In order not to miss the farming season, the loan disbursement work is limited to six days. The total amount of this loan is equivalent to 250,000 jin of millet, approximately 400 million yuan in local currency. The specific allocation is: 40,000 jin for the 13th District, 50,000 jin for the 14th District, 35,000 jin for the 15th District, 20,000 jin for the 16th District, 40,000 jin for the 17th District, 30,000 jin for the 18th District, 5,000 jin for the 19th District, and 10,000 jin for the 20th District. The types of early-maturing crop seeds are stipulated to be barley, spring wheat, and field peas. Each district can also choose seeds according to farmers' planting habits. The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has already shipped a batch of these crop seeds (100,000 jin of spring wheat purchased from Zhangjiakou and 3,000 jin of barley purchased from Baoding) for reserve. Those who are insufficient will be purchased by the farmers themselves.
