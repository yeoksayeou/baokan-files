Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: American imperialism continues to be hostile to the Chinese people, and the US Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees have separately passed reactionary bills to continue aiding the Kuomintang remnant bandits in Taiwan and Hainan to carry out their death throes. According to the United States Information Service, Washington, March 22nd, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee passed on the 21st a measure to use 50 million US dollars from the 104 million US dollars of the 1948 Aid to the Kuomintang bandit gang act that had not been used to aid the Kuomintang remnant bandits. On the same day, the House Foreign Affairs Committee also passed a measure to allocate 40 million US dollars for aiding the bandits. According to a report by the Telecommunications Agency, Connally declared to reporters on the 22nd that the 50 million US dollars for aiding Chiang Kai-shek and the 100 million US dollars for aiding the South Korean puppet approved by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday were both for delivering combat materials.

Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: American imperialism is directing the remnant bandit naval and air forces to intensify various harassing activities against us. Kirk, the former commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet dispatched to Taiwan by the US government, has been staying in Taiwan for more than forty days. His main task is to guide the military activities of the remnant bandits in Taiwan. It is reported that in addition to instructing the bandit naval and air forces to bomb and blockade us, Kirk also plans to have the bandit naval and air forces cooperate in "assaulting" our coastal locations to boost the morale of the bandit army. According to a Central News Agency report, Kirk took a special plane from Taipei to inspect the bandit air force base in Jinmen on the 22nd of this month. In addition, US Air Force Major General Dennis recently visited Taiwan and the Zhoushan Islands to inspect the bandit air force and suggested to the Chiang bandits to open two airfields in Xiangshan Port that can be used for heavy bombers to take off and land, to strengthen the bombing of us.

Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: According to a Reuters report from Manila on the 23rd, quoting newspaper reports, the United States has decided to use 426 tanks to aid the remnant bandits in Taiwan, which are being shipped from the Philippines to Taiwan. Among them, 100 vehicles were loaded onto Kuomintang landing craft in San Francisco on the 22nd of this month. This is further evidence that the US government is superficially declaring a halt to aid to the Chiang bandits while actually continuing to provide military support. This two-faced approach by the US government was re-examined by Truman after the four US chiefs of staff inspected the Far East and returned to the United States in early February this year. MacArthur and Whitehair, commander of the US Western Pacific Defense Command, have been designated to preside over the new aid-Chiang plan and have established close contact with Chiang Kai-shek.

　　继续与中国人民为敌
    美帝援匪五千万美元
    加紧指挥残匪海空军对我骚扰
    【新华社二十四日讯】美参众两院外委会已分别通过继续援助台、琼国民党残匪进行垂死挣扎的反动法案。据美国新闻处华盛顿二十二日讯，参院外委会已于二十一日通过将一九四八年援助国民党匪帮法案项下所未动用的一亿零四百万美元中，以五千万美元援助国民党残匪。同日，众院外委会亦已通过以四千万美元为援匪之用。另据电通社报道，康纳利二十二日向记者宣称：参院外委会昨日所通过援助蒋介石的五千万美元及援助南朝鲜傀儡的一亿美元，均为交付作战物资之用。
    【新华社二十四日讯】美帝国主义正指挥匪残余海空军加紧对我进行各种骚扰活动。由美国政府派往台湾的美国前西太平洋舰队司令柯克，已在台湾勾留四十多天，其主要任务就是指导台湾残匪的军事活动。据息，柯克除了指示匪海空军对我进行轰炸和封锁外，并计划令匪海空军配合“突击”我沿海地点，借以鼓励匪军士气。据匪中央社消息，柯克曾于本月二十二日由台北乘专机赴匪空军基地金门视察。此外，美国空军少将邓尼斯最近亦到台湾和舟山群岛视察匪空军，并向蒋匪建议在象山港开辟可供重轰炸机起落的飞机场两处，以加强对我轰炸。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据路透社马尼剌二十三日电引报纸消息透露：美国决定用以援助台湾残匪的坦克四百二十六辆，正由菲律宾运往台湾。其中一百辆已于本月二十二日装在国民党的登陆艇上离开旧金山。这是美国政府表面上宣称停止援助蒋匪而实际上继续予以军事支持的又一证据。美国政府的这种两面手法，在美国四参谋长于今年二月初旬视察远东返美后曾由杜鲁门重加厘定。麦克阿瑟和美国西太平洋警备司令白吉尔已被指定负责主持新的援蒋计划，并已与蒋介石取得密切联系。
