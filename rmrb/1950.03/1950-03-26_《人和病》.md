Book Review

　　"Man and Disease"
    (By Peng Qingzhao, published by Xinhua Bookstore, a popular science reader on physiology, hygiene and medicine)
    "Man and Disease" is a popular science reader about physiology, hygiene, and medical common sense.

    I am a sick person. In the past, the long-term guerrilla warfare environment caused me to lose my health. I once looked for some books on physiology, hygiene, and medical common sense to study, but what I found were either books on profound medical theories that ordinary people could not understand, or pamphlets that blamed patients for not taking care of their bodies and telling them what nutrients to eat.

    Recently, I saw Peng Qingzhao's "Man and Disease," which gave me a lot of knowledge about restoring and protecting health. This book is really a valuable health guide for us today who neither have the time for long-term recuperation nor a lot of money to increase nutrition.

    This book, as its preface says: "It is a popular science hygiene reader written for general cadres, and also serves as reference material for hygiene classes in general secondary schools; at the same time, it is also required to provide rural doctors of traditional Chinese medicine for self-study of physiology." Its characteristics are comprehensive, detailed, and easy to understand. It has explanations on physiology, and also analysis on pathology and medicine; it has practical examples, and also simple and clear metaphors. More importantly, it can encourage a sick person to have great confidence, and greatly sweep away the pessimistic and desperate influences given by many medical books in the past. It explains many problems from a new scientific perspective, so that people can get a relatively complete scientific knowledge of physiology and hygiene after reading it, and completely sweep away the side effects caused by the mechanical viewpoints in some medical books in the past. Those side effects are excessive fear of bacteria and diseases, excessive reliance on drugs and surgery, or emphasis on passive recuperation, taking tonics, getting tonic injections, and not paying attention to active exercise and proper nutrition.

　　《人和病》
    （彭庆昭著·新华书店出版生理卫生及医学通俗读物）
    《人和病》是一本关于生理卫生和医学常识的通俗读物。
    我是一个有病的人。在过去，长期的游击战争环境使我失去了健康。我曾经找过一些关于生理卫生和医学常识的书籍来学习，但所找来的或者是些关于医药上深奥理论而一般人看不懂的书，或者是那种责备病人自己为什么不爱护身体以及要吃些什么什么营养品的小册子。
    最近，我看到了彭庆昭的《人和病》，这使我得到了许多恢复健康和保护健康的知识。这本书，对于我们今天既不可能有时间长期休养和又没有很多的钱来增加营养的人，实在是一本有价值的健康指导书籍。
    这本书，正如它的序言所说的：“是写给一般干部看的通俗卫生读物，附带还给一般中等学校，作为卫生课的参考材料；同时还要求尽可能的供给农村中医，作为自修生理学之用。”它的特点是全面详细，通俗易懂。有生理方面的解说，也有病理医学方面的分析；有实际例子，也有浅显明白的比喻。更重要的，它会使得一个有病的人鼓舞起极大的信心，大大扫除过去很多医学书所给人的悲观和绝望的影响。它是以新的科学的观点来说明许多问题，使人读了可以得到一个比较完整的科学的生理卫生知识，完全一扫过去有些医学里面机械观点所造成的副作用。那些副作用就是对细菌和疾病的过分恐怖，对药品手术的过分信赖，或是强调消极的休养、吃补药、打补药针、不重视积极锻炼和营养适当。
