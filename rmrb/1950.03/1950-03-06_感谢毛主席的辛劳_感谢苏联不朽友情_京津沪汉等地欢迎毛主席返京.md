The Beijing Guangming Daily wrote in an editorial titled "Welcome Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Back to the Capital": The people of Beijing welcome Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou back to the capital of New China with boundless joy and excitement. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou have established extraordinarily great achievements for the country and the people in the short period of several tens of days of their visit to the Soviet Union. The editorial stated: The great union of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union is a fatal blow to the declining imperialist system, but for the oppressed people of the world, it is a great victory for peace and democracy unprecedented in history.

　　The Tianjin Tianjin Daily commented: The people of our entire city of Tianjin, like the people of the whole country, cheer for the glorious return of our respected leader Chairman Mao with full of love and infinite loyalty. The unprecedented great achievements made by Chairman Mao during his visit to the Soviet Union fill our hearts with great excitement and gratitude. We Tianjin citizens are determined to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union honestly and concentrate all our efforts to restore and develop production, support the liberation war of liberating Tibet, Taiwan, and Hainan Island, and other practical actions, to express our heartfelt support for the new Sino-Soviet treaty.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: Newspapers in Shanghai, Hankou, and Qingdao published the news of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's return to Beijing on the front page and published commentaries. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's commentary said: "Thanks to the efforts and success of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou and others on this trip, China's century-long plan has been completely laid. We have the great ally, the Soviet Union, and victory has been consolidated. We have the economic assistance of the Soviet Union, and the great cause of New Democracy's construction has obtained excellent conditions." The Wenhui Daily's editorial said: "Chairman Mao is back! He traveled long distances for our country and people and completed an unprecedentedly great task. In the future, under his leadership, we should work harder, strengthen our confidence, overcome difficulties, and speed up construction to complete our tasks this year, to repay Chairman Mao's hard work and the immortal friendship of our great friendly country with facts."

　　The Hankou Changjiang Daily's editorial said: After Chairman Mao returns to China, under his leadership and with the assistance of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, New China will more effectively overcome the various difficulties it faces, more smoothly advance various constructions, and rapidly become a strong and industrialized country.

　　After the news of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's arrival in Beijing reached Qingdao, the extra edition of the Qingdao Daily, which published this news, was immediately snapped up by the citizens. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Youth Federation, the Municipal Student Federation, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Branch, and the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce all issued written statements, expressing their determination to work hard to complete their tasks in their respective positions and use practical achievements to thank Chairman Mao for his hard work.
