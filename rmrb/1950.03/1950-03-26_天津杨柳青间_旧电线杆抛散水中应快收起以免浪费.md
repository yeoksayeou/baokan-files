To the Editor:
　　On the 16th of this month, I saw that the utility poles between Tianjin and Yangliuqing had been replaced with new ones from the train. However, the old ones that were taken down were scattered in the water. I think if the wood is soaked in the water for too long, it will be useless for fuel or other purposes. I estimate there are about 260 or 270 of them. Now is the time when we need to be thrifty, and they should be collected as soon as possible to be used for other purposes.

### 天津杨柳青间  旧电线杆抛散水中应快收起以免浪费

　　天津杨柳青间
    旧电线杆抛散水中应快收起以免浪费编辑同志：
    本月十六号，我在火车上看见天津与杨柳青之间电线杆变成新的了。可是换下来的旧的却抛散在水里。我想如果木头在水里泡的时间太长了拿来做燃料或别的用途全不行了，估计大约有二百六七十根。现在正是需要节约的时候，应该把它们早日集中起来做别的用处。
