Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government recently issued a statement regarding U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's March 15th speech on "American Policy Toward Asia," as follows:

On March 15th, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered another lengthy speech on Asia. Acheson has been constantly making speeches and talks recently, with the aim of deceiving some people who still lack experience with the U.S. policy of aggression. However, as long as people check the facts, they can see that Acheson's words are twisted. In his March 15th speech, Acheson said that the United States does not want to "gain anything" from Asia and does not want Asian people to "be deprived of any opportunity, any freedom, and any rights." But in fact, the United States not only acquired the Philippines and many strategic islands in the Pacific more than 50 years ago, not only controlled Japan and South Korea after World War II, but also tried to control China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, and India. The whole world knows that in order to acquire China, the U.S. government supported the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in a large-scale civil war, depriving the Chinese people of any opportunity, any freedom, and any rights to live independently and peacefully. Even now, the U.S. government is still supplying the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with bombers to bomb the Chinese mainland. Isn't this a fact? The United States is using the same method to support puppets such as Bao Dai, Syngman Rhee, and Quirino in order to undermine the national independence movements in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and South Korea, the Philippines, and other places. But Acheson said that the United States is "supporting" the national independence movements of the Asian people. Isn't this an extreme distortion?

Acheson said to the Chinese people: Why don't you ask for American assistance? How much America wants to "help" you! But the Chinese people have learned from their own experience what American so-called "assistance" is. It is the death of millions of people, the loss of national freedom and rights. Since the Chinese people got rid of American "assistance," China has become better and truly independent. This lesson is beneficial to people all over the world, especially to the people of Asian colonies and semi-colonies that have been or are being selected as targets of aggression by U.S. imperialism.

Acheson attempted to continue to sow discord in the newly concluded great alliance between China and the Soviet Union. However, anyone with common sense knows that his despicable rumors and slanders are nothing more than a mayfly trying to shake the Great Wall of world peace. Didn't Acheson declare on January 12th that the Soviet Union was "merging" the four northern regions of China? Why didn't he dare to mention it again in his speech on March 15th? All rumor-mongers have only one future, and that is complete bankruptcy.

Acheson threatened: The Chinese people have formed an equal and friendly alliance with the Soviet Union, and disregarded the "inherent friendship" of the American aggressors, which is "hostile to American interests." He also threatened: China must not interfere in Asian affairs; otherwise, it would be "not only violating every tradition and interest of the Chinese people, but also violating the traditions and interests of their Asian neighbors, the American people, and—indeed—all free people," and would also be "violating the Charter of the United Nations." I think I should tell Acheson on behalf of the largest country in Asia and its people: These ridiculous threats are outdated; be quiet and look at the map! The affairs of the Asian people should be handled by the Asian people themselves, and should not be interfered with at any time by American imperialists across the Pacific, such as Acheson and his ilk!

　　周恩来外长发表谈话  驳斥艾奇逊荒谬演说
    可笑的恫吓早已过时了。亚洲人民的事情应由亚洲人民自己来处理，不应由美帝来干涉！
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长顷就美国国务卿艾奇逊三月十五日关于“美国对亚洲的政策”的演说发表谈话如下：
    美国国务卿艾奇逊在三月十五日又发表了一篇关于亚洲的冗长演说。艾奇逊近来不断地发表演说谈话，其目的是欺骗一部分对于美国侵略政策还缺少经验的人们。但是人们只要拿事实来对证一下，就可以看出艾奇逊的话是颠倒的。艾奇逊在十五日的演说中说：美国不要从亚洲“取得任何东西”，不要使亚洲人民“得不到任何机会，任何自由和任何权利”。但是在事实上，美国不但在五十多年前就取得了菲律宾和太平洋上的许多战略岛屿，不但在世界第二次大战以后控制了日本和南朝鲜，而且力图控制中国、印尼、越南、泰国、缅甸和印度。全世界都知道，美国政府为了取得中国，曾经支持蒋介石匪帮进行了大规模的内战，使中国人民得不到独立地和平地生存的任何机会，任何自由和任何权利。直到现在，美国政府还在供给蒋介石匪帮以轰炸机来轰炸中国大陆，这难道不是事实吗？美国正在以同样的方法支持保大、李承晚和季里诺等傀儡，以破坏越南民主共和国和南朝鲜、菲律宾等地的民族独立运动。但是艾奇逊却说，美国是“支持”亚洲人民的民族独立运动的。这难道不是极端的颠倒吗？
    艾奇逊对中国人说：你们为什么不要求美国的援助呢？美国是多么想“援助”你们啊！但是中国人已经从亲身的经验中懂得了美国的所谓“援助”是什么东西。这就是几百万人的死亡，就是民族自由和权利的丧失。自从中国人摆脱了美国的“援助”，中国就好起来了，就真正地独立起来了。这个教训，对于全世界人民都是有益的，对于已经或正在被美国帝国主义选择为侵略对象的亚洲殖民地半殖民地的人民尤其是有益的。
    艾奇逊对于新缔结的中苏两国的伟大同盟关系，企图继续进行挑拨，但是稍有常识的人都知道，他的卑鄙的造谣污蔑，不过等于一只蜉蝣想去撼动世界和平的万里长城而已。艾奇逊在一月十二日不是就宣布过苏联正在将中国北部四大地区“实行合并”吗？他在三月十五日的演说中为什么不敢再提了呢？一切造谣者只能有一个前途，这就是彻底的破产。
    艾奇逊恫吓说：中国人民和苏联结成了平等友好的同盟，而把美国侵略者的“固有友谊”漠视不顾，这就是“敌视美国的利益”。他又恫吓说：亚洲的事务中国必须不加闻问，否则就是“不仅违反中国人民的每一种传统和利益，而且将违反他们的亚洲邻邦的、美国人民的、以及——真的——一切自由人民的传统和利益”，而且将“违反联合国的宪章”。我想，我应当代表亚洲最大的国家及其人民告诉艾奇逊：这些可笑的恫吓早已过时了；安静些，并且看看地图吧！亚洲人民自己的事情，应当由亚洲人民自己来处理，而无论在什么时候，也不应当由太平洋彼岸的美国帝国主义者，例如艾奇逊之流，来加以干涉！
