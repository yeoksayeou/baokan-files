    Nearly One Million Jin of Mountain Products and Medicinal Materials Packed and Shipped Last Month

    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China Native Produce Company is vigorously organizing the masses to engage in sideline production. At the beginning of February, the company made thorough arrangements and guidance for the work of its three processing factories for mountain products, medicinal materials, and straw braid. Through various means, it mobilized male and female labor to actively participate in the production of each factory. In the past month, the three processing factories have averaged about 1,000 workers per day. The workers are all in high spirits for production and are launching production competitions with each other. As of the end of February, the Tianjin Mountain Products Factory, Medicinal Materials Factory, Straw Braid Factory, and the Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, and Linqing branches have packed and shipped over 990,000 jin of peach kernels, peppercorns, medicinal materials, and other commodities.
