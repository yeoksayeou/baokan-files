[Beijing News] The Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has decided that all municipal coeducational middle schools will hold unified enrollment examinations for grade-level students (high school freshman, high school sophomore, middle school freshman, middle school sophomore) on March 5th, and will provide preferential treatment to the children of workers, cadres, and overseas Chinese. The registration period is from March 2nd to 4th. The preferential treatment measures for children of workers, children of cadres, and children of overseas Chinese are as follows: (1) Each school must guarantee that all vacancies in the worker children's classes (a total of nineteen classes) newly established last autumn will be filled by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, which will uniformly introduce nearly ninety people to take the grade-level test; (2) The direct descendants of cadres who have participated in the revolution for many years, who have academic credentials for registration, will be given priority preferential treatment; (3) Overseas Chinese children have consistently yearned for the motherland under imperialist rule. If their grades are the same as those of other students, these overseas Chinese children will be given priority admission. This enrollment will be based on the vacancies in each school, and the number of vacancies in each school will be announced at the school gate.
