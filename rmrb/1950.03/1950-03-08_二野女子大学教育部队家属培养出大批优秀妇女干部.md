Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th. The Women's University established by the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has cultivated a large number of outstanding women cadres and educated and improved a large number of family members of military cadres over the past two years. As early as 1947, when the Second Field Army crossed the river to counterattack, the headquarters of each column in North China established family schools to organize the wives of military cadres to study. After the Second Field Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced southward last year, the cadre family schools established by each army were consolidated and reorganized into the Women's University of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, which was officially established in the Central Plains area on May 1st, with Commander Liu Bocheng personally serving as the president concurrently. In addition to the main campus, the school also has four branch campuses, with nearly 4,000 women cadres, students, and staff members. It also has 13 nursery schools with more than 2,600 children.

The students of the school are mostly female comrades who have undergone revolutionary training, some are rural women, and some are illiterate housewives. Their cultural level is generally low, but they are hardworking and simple, have undergone long-term revolutionary training, and have a firm revolutionary stand. After the students enter the school, the school arranges them into elementary, high elementary, and junior high school classes according to their cultural level for regular study. The content of the study includes cultural and political subjects, aiming to improve the cultural level, political understanding, and working ability of cadre family members, and cultivate them into outstanding women cadres and women workers. After they entered the school, they received education on the new women's outlook on life, and through "speaking out bitterness" and "opposing dependence thinking," they broke the concerns of being unwilling to learn and fearing that they would not learn well, correctly established the new women's revolutionary outlook on life, and launched a learning upsurge, and also carried out mutual learning assistance and learning model movements. After several months of study, the students have made significant improvements in culture. Those who were originally illiterate have learned to write simple letters and diaries. Students with higher levels have improved their writing and reading abilities and have learned some common sense of natural science and accounting and arithmetic. Their political understanding has also greatly improved, they have strengthened their collective life training, jumped out of the lifestyle accustomed to the small circle of rural families, established a spirit of serving the people and striving forward, and broke the idea of ​​relying on their husbands. In the study, the students' labor views have also been greatly strengthened. They built classrooms and cut bedding grass by themselves. During the summer and autumn seasons, all the students actively participated in helping the masses with harvesting.

Under planned cultivation and promotion, the students' work ability has gradually been improved. According to statistics, in the past five months, among the students who served as group leaders, class leaders, and district team leaders, those who have been promoted to administrative, political, educational, and affairs work cadres after work tests include 3 regimental-level cadres, 24 battalion-level cadres, 39 company-level cadres, and 321 platoon-level cadres. Women cadres account for 55% of all cadres in the school; at the same time, a large number of health and childcare workers have also been trained. From May to September last year, the four branch schools successively sent more than 100 women students to participate in local work. In a few months, they helped launch the struggle against local tyrants in 14 villages, cultivated 13 local farmer cadres, helped organize more than 4,300 people's armed forces, and recruited more than 70 bandits to return home for registration, which greatly helped local work. Due to their hard work and active work, from May to October of last year, 318 students in the school gloriously joined the Communist Party.

　　二野女子大学教育部队家属培养出大批优秀妇女干部
    【新华社重庆七日电】人民解放军第二野战军所设立的女子大学，两年多来培养了大批优秀的妇女干部，教育和提高了大批的部队干部家属。早在一九四七年第二野战军渡河反攻时，各纵队在华北的留守处均成立了家属学校，组织部队干部的妻子进行学习。去年第二野战军渡江南进后，将各军分别成立的干部家属学校集中整编成立人民解放军第二野战军女子大学，五月一日在中原区正式成立，由刘伯承司令员亲自兼任校长。该校除总校外尚有四个分校，共有妇女干部、学员、工作人员近四千人。另附设托儿所十三所，有儿童二千六百余名。
    该校学员成份大部分是经过革命锻炼的女同志，一部分是农村妇女，其中有些是一字不识的家庭妇女。她们的文化水平一般都很低，但艰苦朴素，久经革命的锻炼，革命立场坚定。学员入校后，学校方面即按其文化程度，分别编入初小、高小、初中各班，进行正规学习。学习内容包括文化、政治等课目，目的在提高干部家属的文化水平、政治认识和工作能力，培养成为优秀的妇女干部及妇女工作人员。她们入校后，进行了新妇女人生观的教育，经过“诉苦”、“反对依赖思想”，打破不愿学习和怕学不好的顾虑，正确地树立了新妇女的革命人生观，展开了学习热潮，并且进行了学习互助和学习模范运动。学员们经过几个月的学习后，在文化上就有了显著的提高，原来不识字的已学会写简单的信件和日记。程度较高的学员提高了写读能力，学会了一些自然科学常识和会计、算术。政治认识也有很大提高，加强了集体生活锻炼，跳出习惯于农村家庭小圈子的生活作风，树立了为人民服务的前进奋发的精神，打破了依赖丈夫的想法。在学习中，学员们的劳动观点也大大加强了，她们自己动手砌教室、割铺草。夏秋两季全校同学们都积极地参加了帮助群众收割。
    在有计划的培养、提拔下，学员们的工作能力逐步地得到了提高。据统计，五个月来，由学员中担任小组长、班长、区队长经过工作考验提升为行政、政治、教育、事务等工作干部的有团级干部三人，营级干部二十四人，连级干部三十九人，排级干部三百二十一人。全校妇女干部占全体干部百分之五十五；同时并培养了大批卫生和保育工作人员。去年五月到九月，四分校先后派出妇女学员百余人参加地方工作，几个月中帮助发动了十四个村群众的反恶霸斗争，培养本地农民干部十三人，帮助组织群众武装四千三百余人，招抚土匪七十余人回家登记，对地方工作帮助很大。由于她们的努力学习和积极工作，从去年五月到十月的五个月中，全校学员中已有三百一十八人光荣地参加了共产党。
