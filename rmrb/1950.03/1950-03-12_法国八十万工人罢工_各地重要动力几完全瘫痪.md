　　French 800,000 Workers Strike
    Major Power Sources Across Regions Almost Completely Paralyzed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th] According to a report from the French newspaper *Ce Soir* cited by TASS: Currently in France, 800,000 working people are on strike demanding increased wages and subsidies. In addition to the metal workers, automobile workers, and transportation workers who are still persisting in their strike, the vast majority of workers in the important economic sectors of electricity and gas also began striking on the 9th. The strike has almost completely disrupted the work of all gas factories in France. The electricity and power supply in places like Paris, Toulon, Lille, and Lyon has either been completely cut off or the voltage has been reduced. The Pidault government is deeply apprehensive about this situation. After their conspiracy to buy off and conscript a small number of workers to sabotage the strike failed, they mobilized military police to forcibly occupy the striking power plants in various locations. According to TASS, the French government dispatched police and so-called "security forces" on the evening of the 9th to occupy eight major power plants supplying electricity to the Paris area.
    The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement regarding the strike, stating that the current strike of the French working people is a struggle to secure the signing of collective contracts and a subsidy of 3,000 francs per month, which is the basis for united action of the working people. The announcement then pointed out that this struggle has won victories in many enterprises across the country, and the announcement finally called on all French working people to strengthen unity to win greater victories.

　　法国八十万工人罢工
    各地重要动力几完全瘫痪
    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社引法国《今晚报》消息称：法国目前有八十万劳动人民为要求增加工资与增发津贴而在罢工中。除金属工人、汽车工人与交通工人仍在坚持罢工外，重要的经济部门电力业与煤气业中的绝大多数工人，又于九日开始罢工。罢工几乎使法国一切煤气工厂的工作完全中断。巴黎、土伦、里尔、里昂等地的电力和动力，不是全部停止供应，便是降低电压。皮杜尔政府对于这种情势，深感惶恐，在企图收买与征发少数工人破坏罢工的阴谋失败以后，便调动军警强行占领各地罢工的电力厂。据塔斯社称，法政府于九日晚派遣警察与所谓“保安队”，占领了供应巴黎区电力的八个主要电力厂。
    法国总工会执行局对于这次罢工发表声明称：现在法国劳动人民的罢工，是为争取签订集体合同与每月三千法郎津贴而斗争，这正是劳动人民行动一致的基础。公告继而指出：这一斗争已在全国许多企业中赢得胜利，公告最后号召法国一切劳动人民加强团结，以争取更大胜利。
