Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: Having exhausted all other options, the American imperialists, who had seemingly abandoned Chiang Kai-shek, supported the bandit Chiang in staging the farce of "restoring" his "presidential" position on the 1st of this month. In reality, this has not and cannot create any change, because the bandit Chiang has always been the actual leader of the Kuomintang remnants. This is just another indication of the complete bankruptcy of the American policy of aggression against China. Li Zongren, who was once used by the US State Department to superficially replace Chiang Kai-shek, has lost his value as a substitute after the failure of the false peace plot and the annihilation of the Gui系 bandit army. Although the traitor Li declared in the United States that he would "fight" against the "illegal restoration" of the bandit Chiang, it is believed that the US State Department has decided to assign Li to another task, namely, to organize the so-called "third force." It is reported that Li Zongren's "new party" will be joined by Hu Shih, Chiang Tingfu, and others, and will be directed behind the scenes by John Leighton Stuart.

　　在美国务院指挥下
    蒋贼演出“复位”丑剧
    李贼受美帝命组织“新党”
    【新华社北京三日电】由于再没有其他的办法，表面上抛弃了蒋介石的美国帝国主义，又在本月一日支持蒋贼演出所谓恢复“总统”职位的丑剧。事实上这并没有也不能造成任何变化，因为蒋贼一直是国民党残匪的实际魁首。这只是又一次表示了美国侵华政策的彻底破产。一度被美国国务院用来在表面上代替蒋介石的李宗仁，在假和平阴谋失败和桂系匪军被消灭以后，已丧失了代用品的价值。虽然李贼在美宣称他将为反对蒋贼的“非法复职”而“奋斗”，但是人们相信美国国务院已决定委派李贼担任另一种任务，即组织所谓“第三种力量”。据息：李宗仁的“新党”将由胡适、蒋廷黻等参加，而由司徒雷登担任幕后指挥。
