　　From "Jinbao Niang" to Thoughts on the Water and Soil Mother
    Qiu Yin
    I wait for the arrival of the People's Daily every day, as a result of missing "Jinbao Niang" so much. The story is not finished yet, and my heart is always uneasy. Only after seeing Comrade Lao Ma understand the reason why Jinbao Niang went into the water did I breathe a sigh of relief.
    I am familiar with the background of figures like Jinbao Niang. I remember when I was a child, among several companions, I was most afraid of getting close to the neighbor's child, Shuitu, because his mother was "struck to death by thunder," and people said she was an "improper woman."
    One summer, after a big storm, I followed many people to see the Water and Soil Mother, who had been electrocuted. Her scorched face was even more terrifying than Bao Gong on the stage. Her hoe was still beside her. Later, the pockmarked head of the village's wife came to the yard and said, "The Water and Soil Mother was unchaste. She cheated on her husband when he went to be a soldier, and the heavens were angered..."
    A few years later, one day Shuitu and I were sitting together resting in the woods not far from where his mother died (by this time I had eliminated the childish notion that Shuitu was scary), and he thought of his mother. He said, "Early on, the pockmarked head of the village often came to my house to play, with a happy smile on his face. My mother would just pour him a cup of tea and then go with me to push the mill. Not long after, Dad was drafted into the army. The pockmarked head of the village came even more frequently. He touched and pawed at my mother. Once, my mother pushed him to the ground, and he got up and slapped her hard in the face. After Dad was drafted, my mother had to go to the fields to work alone..." Shuitu said, crying. I couldn't find any words to comfort him at the time. Tens of thousands of figures like Jinbao Niang and the Water and Soil Mother were objects of insult in the old society; for thousands of years, they have been living with tears in their eyes. Now, the revolution led by the Communist Party has won victory throughout the country, and tens of thousands of Jinbao Niangs have been reborn from this.

　　从“金宝娘”想到水土娘
    邱引
    我每天等着人民日报的到来，我是那样想念“金宝娘”的结果。这故事画未载完，我的心总是放不下。一直看到老马同志明白了金宝娘下水的原因，我才松过一口气来。
    金宝娘式人物的身世，我是熟习的。记得我少年时候，在几个伙伴中，我最怕与邻家孩子水土接近，因为他娘是被“天雷打死”的被人说是“不正经的女人”。
    是在一个夏天，一阵大暴风过后，我跟着许多人去看触电惨死的水土娘，她的烧焦的脸比戏台上的包公还可怕，她身旁还留着她的锄头。后来麻脸保长的媳妇到院子里来说：“水土娘不贞节，丈夫去当兵就偷汉，老天爷动了怒……”
    过了几年，有一天水土同我一起坐在离他娘死处不远的树林休息（这时我已消除对水土可怕那种幼稚的念头了），他想起了娘。他说：“早先，麻脸保长时常到我家里来玩，嘴吧笑喜喜地，我娘只倒杯茶给他就与我去推磨了。过了不久爹就给抽壮丁抽走了。麻脸保长也来得更勤了。他对娘动手动脚的，一次被娘推倒在地，他爬起来狠狠地打娘一个耳光。爹抽走后娘只得自个儿到田里干活……”水土说着哭了。我当时亦找不到话来安慰他。成千成万金宝娘和水土娘式的人物，在旧社会里是侮辱的对象；千百年来，她们一直含着眼泪生活。现在，共产党所领导的革命就在全国范围内获得胜利，成千成万的金宝娘从此得到新生了。
