Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 16th: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, in order to implement the resolution of the National Urban Supply Conference held last December, has massively transferred public grain from Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces to supply the two neighboring administrative regions of North China and East China, as well as the new districts of Guangdong and Guangxi, the disaster areas, special product areas, and small and medium-sized cities in the Central South region that are lacking grain. This large-scale transfer work began in January of this year. As of February 23rd, 150 million jin of the planned 200 million jin of wheat to be transported to North China had been completed; over 48.719 million jin of rice had been transported to Shanghai; in addition, over 10 million jin of the 100 million jin of coarse grains to be transported to Shandong had been initially completed; and a portion of the rice to be transported to Guangdong and Guangxi had also been completed. Currently, the grain collection work in various provinces has been largely completed, and manpower and transportation tools are being actively organized for successive shipments, which are expected to be completed by May of this year at the latest. To ensure the completion of this massive task, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Region established a grain transport organization headed by the heads of the financial and trade departments as early as the end of last December to coordinate the overall work. Various provinces have also successively established specialized grain transport agencies, making the completion of the grain transport task one of the central tasks of the financial plan for the first half of 1950. However, according to the situation in various localities, the provinces have not yet been able to carry out sufficient organizational mobilization work and integrate it with the mass movement, especially with mass production for self-salvation. As a result, some farmers are concerned that grain shortages will occur after the grain is transported away, providing an opportunity for special agents to spread rumors and sabotage. For example, in Taoyuan, Hunan, losses were incurred due to the looting of grain.

The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee has instructed various localities to pay attention to preventing and correcting this phenomenon, pointing out that the grain transport task and plan must be conveyed and fully discussed through representative meetings; closely integrate with local mass movements and mass production for self-salvation; adopt effective methods such as providing work as a form of relief to mobilize the masses to complete the grain transport work; and also pay attention to accurately grasping the prices of goods in the grain transport areas and flexibly regulating the market for grain and other materials. Instructions require various localities to have accurate calculations of the amount of public and private grain reserves, and after effectively taking care of the needs of the local people, transport the surplus grain out. In areas with convenient transportation, planned transportation should be carried out to avoid excessive outflow of grain affecting local supply.

In order to ensure the safety of public grain transportation, the Central South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have jointly instructed the local troops of various provinces to closely cooperate with the grain transfer agencies, assist in escorting and guarding warehouses, and treat this work as a combat mission to ensure that public grain is not lost. The instructions also stipulate that if there is insufficient manpower for loading and unloading workers at stations and docks during the transfer, the troops can also participate in the loading and unloading work, and the labor costs will be paid according to the standards stipulated in various localities.

The Yangtze River Daily published an editorial on this, calling on all localities to resolutely complete the task of transferring public grain, and pointing out that there must be careful planning, accurate calculation, unified command, and regular supervision and inspection during the transfer to eliminate possible waste, loss, and corruption.

　　中南区运粮二亿余斤  供应华北华东及两广
    现正继续赶运保证完成任务
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中南军政委员会财政经济委员会贯彻执行去年十二月全国城市供给会议的决议，自河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省大量调拨公粮供应华北、华东两大友邻行政区和两广新区、中南各缺粮的灾区、特产区及中小城市。规模庞大的调运工作开始于今年一月，截至二月二十三日为止，原计划运华北的二亿斤小麦，已完成一亿五千万斤；运上海的大米，完成四千八百七十一万九千余斤；此外，运山东的一亿斤杂粮，亦初步完成一千余万斤；运两广的大米，亦已完成一部。目前各省粮食集中工作均已大体完成，正积极组织人力及运输工具，陆续起运，预计至迟至今年五月间即可赶运完毕。中南区财政经济委员会为保证这一巨大任务的完成，早在去年十二月底即已成立了以财委贸易部门负责人为主的运粮组织，统一调度。各省亦先后成立了专门的运粮机构，把完成运粮任务作为一九五○年上半年度财政计划的中心任务之一。但根据各地情况，目前各省在执行任务中，尚未能进行充分的组织动员工作及结合群众运动，特别是结合群众生产自救做得尚差，以致部分地区农民群众因不了解运粮意义，产生了怕粮被运走后发生粮荒的顾虑，予特务造谣破坏以可乘之机。如湖南桃源等地，曾因此招致粮食被劫的损失。
    中南军政委员会财委会已指示各地注意防止和纠正此种现象，指出必须普遍通过代表会传达和充分讨论运粮任务及计划；密切结合各地群众运动与群众生产自救工作；采用以工代赈等有效办法，深入发动群众来完成运粮工作；同时还须注意正确掌握运粮地区物价及灵活调剂市场粮食物资。指示要求各地对公私存粮数量应有精确计算，切实照顾本地人民需要后，再将余粮运出，交通方便地区更要做到有计划的调运，以免粮食流出过多后影响当地供应。
    为保证公粮运输的安全，中南军政委员会和中国人民解放军中南军区已联合指示各省地方部队，应密切配合调粮机关，协助押运、护仓，并将这一工作当作一个战斗任务来执行，使公粮不受损失。指示并规定：在调运中，如车站、码头装卸工人人力不足时，部队亦可参加装卸工作，力资按各地规定标准支付。
    长江日报就此发表社论，号召各地坚决完成调运公粮任务，并指出在调运时必须有周密计划，精确计算，统一指挥，经常督促检查，杜绝可能发生的浪费、耗损和贪污等现象。
