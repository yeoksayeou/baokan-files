Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th: The People's Governments of North China provinces successively formulated plans for promoting improved varieties and preventing and controlling pests and diseases in February, and some provinces have already begun purchasing various improved varieties to ensure the realization of this year's production increase tasks.

    The Shanxi Provincial People's Government plans to promote 500,000 mu of various improved crop varieties this year, and prepare to replace all major crops in the province with improved seeds within five years. The province plans to promote improved varieties through competitions of improved varieties, exhibitions of standard crops, and field visits, and conduct education for farmers on maintaining the purity of improved seeds and preventing disasters to increase production. The province's work on purchasing improved varieties has already begun. In Yuci and Fenyang special districts alone, more than 147,000 jin of improved varieties such as "811" millet, "4198" sorghum, and "Golden Queen" corn have been purchased and exchanged. The cotton-producing areas of southern and central Shanxi have also purchased and exchanged more than 8 million jin of pure strains of S-character and Gold-character high quality cotton.

    The Hebei Provincial People's Government plans to promote improved varieties on more than 14,300 hectares this year. At the same time, it plans to completely replace cotton, wheat, millet, corn, etc. with improved seeds within five years from 1950 to 1954, at which time the province's grain output can be increased by 20%. To this end, the province plans to widely mobilize the masses to establish "seed retention plots," and establish a large number of improved variety breeding households with production heroes, models, and members of village technical committees as the main targets. County farms will be responsible for technical guidance to carry out the breeding and promotion of improved varieties.

    The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government plans to promote more than 1.9 million mu of improved varieties of wheat, millet, and S-character cotton, which is estimated to increase food production by more than 23.54 million jin. The province plans to designate more than a dozen villages around the provincial farm as purebred breeding areas, and each county and district will establish small purebred areas in five or six villages near the district office. In addition, the province plans to mobilize the masses to conduct universal field selection of major crops this year.

    The Chahar Provincial People's Government accepted the experience of reduced grain production last year due to the complexity of varieties, and determined to vigorously promote seed soaking, seed mixing, and exchange of improved varieties this spring. The province has now transferred 1,000 shi of "Dama Ya" corn seeds from western Hebei to Xuanhua, and purchased 200 shi of 100-day small corn seeds from Shanxi, planning to promote them to Guangling, Lingqiu, and Yingxian. The province is transferring more than 30 people from various farms to form an improved variety promotion team, preparing to go deep into various counties to carry out the promotion of improved varieties.

    Regarding the prevention and control of pests and diseases, the People's Governments of various provinces have also made plans: In order to prevent insects and diseases, Pingyuan Province is preparing to mobilize the masses to eliminate weeds on the edges of fields and roads, carry out universal plowing and deep plowing, collect insect pupae, and mix seeds with medicines to eliminate pests and diseases. Shanxi Province requires that seed disinfection and drug treatment be carried out on 10 million mu of land this year, and insect pests be eliminated on 4.6 million mu of land. Hebei Province has designated farms in Baoding, Cangxian, Xingtai, Tianjin and other places to cooperate with the Central Locust Control Station to vigorously prevent and control possible insect disasters; to strive to eliminate black smut and insect disasters. Chahar Province has decided to send technical cadres to various special districts and counties to promote the seed soaking method. The provincial government has also printed a large number of technical promotion manuals and pictorials to widely publicize the benefits of soaking and mixing seeds. The Provincial Department of Agriculture is purchasing medicines and machinery needed for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. It has purchased 42 dozen thermometers, 270,000 jin of alcohol for mixing seeds, 200 sprayers, and 60,000 jin of arsenic.

　　华北各省制定计划
    推广优良品种防除病虫害  保证实现今年增产粮棉任务
    【新华社北京十三日电】华北各省人民政府于二月间先后制定推广优良品种和防除病虫害的计划，有些省并已开始收购各种优良品种，以保证今年增产任务的实现。
    山西省人民政府计划今年推广各种农作物优良品种五十万亩，并准备争取五年内将全省各种主要作物一律换为优良种子。该省计划通过优良品种的比赛、标准农作物的展览和田间参观等办法进行优良品种的推广，并向各地农民进行优种保纯、防灾增产的教育。该省收购优良品种的工作已经开始，仅榆次、汾阳两专区即已收购、互换“八一一”谷、“四一九八”高粱、“金皇后”玉米等优良品种十四万七千余斤。晋南、晋中产棉区亦已收购及互换斯字、金字良棉纯种八百余万斤。
    河北省人民政府计划今年推广优良品种一万四千三百余顷，同时计划自一九五○年至一九五四年五年内，把全省棉、麦、谷、玉米等完全换成优良种子，届时全省可增产粮食百分之二十。为此，该省计划广泛发动群众建立“留种地”，并以各地生产英雄、模范和村技术委员会委员为主要对象，建立大量优良品种繁殖户，由县农场负责技术指导，进行优良品种的繁殖和推广工作。
    平原省人民政府计划推广小麦、谷物、斯字棉等优良品种一百九十余万亩，估计可增产食粮二千三百五十四万余斤。该省计划在省农场周围划十几村作为纯种繁殖区，各县、区则在区公所附近五、六村建立小纯种区。此外，该省准备今年发动广大群众对主要作物进行普遍的田间选种。
    察哈尔省人民政府接受去年因品种庞杂使粮食减产的经验，确定今春大力推行浸种、拌种与调换优良品种。该省现已自冀西调运一千市石的“大马牙”玉米种到宣化，并由山西购买百日小玉米种二百市石，计划推广到广灵、灵邱、应县一带。该省正从各农场调拨三十余人，组成优良品种推广队，准备深入各县进行优良品种的推广工作。
    关于防除病虫害，各省人民政府亦作出了计划：平原省为防虫防病，准备发动群众以铲除地边和路旁的杂草、普耕深耕、检拾虫蛹、用药拌种等方法，免除病虫害。山西省要求今年在一千万亩土地上进行种籽消毒和药剂治疗，在四百六十万亩土地上扑灭虫害。河北省已指定保定、沧县、邢台、天津等地农场，配合中央治蝗工作站，大力防除可能发生的虫灾；为消灭黑穗病和虫灾而努力。察哈尔省决定派遣技术干部分头到各专区、县推广浸种办法，省府并印制大批技术推广手册和画刊，广泛宣传浸、拌种的好处。该省农业厅正购置防除病虫灾所需药械，现已购到温度计四十二打，拌种酒精二十七万斤，喷雾器二百个，信石六万斤。
