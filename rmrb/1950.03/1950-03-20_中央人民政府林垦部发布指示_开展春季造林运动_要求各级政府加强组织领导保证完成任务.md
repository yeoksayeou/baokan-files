Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation has issued instructions regarding spring afforestation. The full text of the instructions is as follows:

　　(1) Tree planting and afforestation should commence early, before spring plowing, taking advantage of the agricultural off-season to plant before budding, in order to increase the survival rate. In North China, the period between the Awakening of Insects and the Spring Equinox is generally suitable. In East China, where the climate is warmer, the afforestation season should be even earlier. In Northwest and Northeast China, where the climate is cold, the period around the Qingming Festival is generally suitable.

　　(2) In addition to mobilizing the masses for general tree planting, efforts should be focused on key areas such as barren mountains, sandy areas prone to wind, along rivers and coasts, and along highways and railways. Specific plans should be formulated, and governments should mobilize labor to organize the masses to plant trees in sections, systematically creating protective forests to prevent wind, sand, and floods, consolidate roadbeds, and ensure agricultural production.

　　(3) Closing hillsides for afforestation is a fundamental method for greening barren mountains, conserving water sources, and preventing floods. In mountainous villages, this should be promoted as widely and systematically as possible. Specific plans for closing hillsides should be formulated through the masses, demarcating restricted areas and expanding them year by year. In areas where conditions permit, sowing and afforestation should also be carried out (using native tree species). Residual forest trees and wild saplings on the mountains should be closed off for protection and nurtured into forests. The extraction of roots and stumps should be prohibited to prevent soil erosion.

　　(4) Special-purpose tree species such as tung oil trees, camphor trees, tea trees, lacquer trees, Chinese tallow trees, walnuts, chestnuts, pears, apricots, prickly ash, and dates grow quickly, yield high returns, and occupy an important position in foreign trade. Bamboo grows rapidly and can sometimes replace timber, solving part of the paper material supply and urgent construction needs. These should be cultivated in large quantities in different regions, rewarding farmers for utilizing vacant land, developing sideline production, and increasing farmers' income.

　　(5) In suburban areas of cities lacking fuel, fast-growing firewood forests should be cultivated with a focus on providing fuel, fundamentally resolving the problem of indiscriminate logging and arbitrary firewood gathering.

　　(6) In key afforestation areas lacking seedlings, attention should be paid to seizing the season and carrying out seedling cultivation work. In addition to establishing public nurseries in a planned way, private and cooperative nurseries should be promoted, encouraged, and assisted.

　　Afforestation and forest protection are both important. It is necessary to combine them with the vital interests of the masses.

　　In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, governments at all levels must strengthen organizational leadership and take the following measures to launch a mass afforestation campaign:

　　1. Resolutely implement the forest protection policy, and organize the masses to establish covenants to protect trees. According to the experience of the old liberated areas of North China over the years, villages that do a good job in forest protection have more achievements in the afforestation movement.

　　2. Administrative and technical leadership should be closely combined. At forestry-related meetings held in various places, farmers and technicians with rich tree planting experience can be invited to participate to exchange experience; or planting techniques can be introduced at production meetings to enable cadres at all levels to learn technical points, personally lead the masses, teach the masses, and develop the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation, in order to improve the survival rate of afforestation.

　　3. Larger-scale afforestation projects on sandy and barren mountains can be organized based on the principles of voluntary mutual assistance, equal value, and mutual benefit. The masses can invest in cooperative afforestation with labor, seedlings, seeds, cash, and barren land. However, the profit-sharing method must be clearly defined to prevent disputes after the trees grow. In areas where seedlings are scarce, forestry agencies can invest in public-private joint ventures with seedlings. In short, collective afforestation must be combined with the vital interests of the masses. In western Hebei and other places, cooperative afforestation is already popular with the masses. Other areas with the appropriate conditions should introduce the experience of cooperative afforestation.

　　4. In areas lacking seedlings, every effort should be made to assist the masses in purchasing them or exchanging various suitable branches, cuttings, and wild seedlings for goods. In some market towns, seedling markets and afforestation cooperative organizations should be promoted to solve the difficulty of obtaining seedlings.

　　5. Strengthen inspection work, carry out afforestation competitions, and ensure the completion of tasks. Regions or individuals with excellent afforestation results, especially activists in the labor afforestation movement, should be given collective and individual commendations and rewards.

　　6. All localities should formulate specific plans based on local conditions, grasp key points, conduct in-depth publicity and education, and provide concrete organizational leadership. The phenomenon of merely issuing calls and making arrangements without mobilization, organization, and inspection must be overcome. The reporting system should be strengthened, and experiences should be exchanged in a timely manner. This is the central link in launching the spring afforestation movement.

　　中央人民政府林垦部发布指示
    开展春季造林运动
    要求各级政府加强组织领导保证完成任务
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府林垦部顷发布关于春季造林的指示，指示全文如下：
    （一）植树造林宜在春耕以前及早着手，利用农闲，在发芽前栽植，以提高成活率。华北各地一般应在惊蛰至春分间为宜，华东气候温暖，造林季节更应提前，西北、东北气候寒冷，一般应在清明前后。
    （二）除发动群众进行普遍一般的栽树外，更应在山荒、沙荒犯风地区、沿河沿海、沿公路铁路，选择重点，制订具体计划，由政府动员劳动力，分段组织群众栽树，有计划的营造防护林以防止风沙水患，巩固路基，保障农业生产。
    （三）封山育林为绿化荒山、涵养水源、防止水灾的治本方法。山区村庄，应尽可能普遍的有计划的推行，通过群众制定封山具体计划，划定禁区，逐年扩大。在有条件地区并应进行播种造林（树种要采用乡土树种），对山上的残余林木和野生幼树，应加以封禁保护，抚育成林，禁止采掘根株，防止土壤冲刷。
    （四）油桐、樟、茶、漆、乌柏、核桃、栗、梨、杏、花椒、枣等特用树种成长速，收益大，对外贸易占重要地位。竹子生长迅速，有时可代替木材，解决一部分纸料供应和建设急需。这些都应分别地区，奖励农民，利用隙地，大量培植，发展副业生产，增加农民收入。
    （五）在燃料缺乏的都市近郊则宜有重点的培植生长迅速的薪炭林，供给燃料所需，以便从基本上解决滥伐树木，任意樵采的事件。
    （六）在造林重点缺乏树苗地区，应注意抓紧季节，开展育苗工作。除有计划建立公营苗圃外，并提倡、奖励、辅助私营与合作苗圃。
  造林与护林都很重要  要结合群众切身利益
    为了保证上述任务的完成，各级政府必须加强组织领导，采取以下各种措施，开展群众性的造林运动：
    １、坚决贯彻护林政策，组织群众订立公约，保护林木。根据华北老解放区多年的经验，那村护林工作做得好，那村的造林运动就更有成绩。
    ２、行政与技术领导要密切结合。在各地召开的有关林业的会议上，可聘请当地富有栽树经验的农民及技术人员参加，以交流经验；或在生产会议上，介绍植树技术，使各级干部学会技术要点，亲自动手带领群众、教会群众、发展群众对造林的积极性，以提高造林成活率。
    ３、沙荒山荒等较大面积的造林可本着自愿互助等价两利的原则，组织群众，以劳力、树苗、种子、现款、荒地等入股合作造林，但须明定分红办法，以防林木成长后引起纠纷。在树苗缺乏的地方，可由林业机关以树苗入股公私合营。总之，要把集体造林和群众切身利益结合起来。在冀西等地合作造林已为群众所喜爱。其他有条件的地区应很好的介绍合作造林的经验。
    ４、在缺乏树苗地区，应尽力协助群众去购买，或用实物换取各种适当的枝条插穗与野生的苗木等。并在有些集镇组织树苗市及推广组织造林合作社，以解决树苗的困难。
    ５、加强检查工作，开展造林竞赛，保证任务的完成。对造林成绩优良的地区或个人，特别是劳动造林运动中的积极分子，应给以集体的及个人的表扬奖励。
    ６、各地应因地制宜，制定具体计划，掌握重点，深入宣传教育，具体组织领导，克服光有号召与布置而无发动组织与检查的现象，并要加强报告制度，及时交流经验，这是开展春季造林运动的中心环节。
