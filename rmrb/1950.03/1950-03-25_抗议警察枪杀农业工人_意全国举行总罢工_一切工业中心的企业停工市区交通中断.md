Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 23rd: A general strike was held throughout Italy on the 22nd. Businesses in all industrial centers across the country were shut down, and city traffic was interrupted. The general strike was announced by the Italian General Confederation of Labor to protest the incident on the 21st in which Italian police in the village of Lintella in the Abruzzo province shot and killed two unemployed agricultural workers and injured ten others. L'Unità, the Italian Communist Party newspaper, pointed out that despite the police's brutal suppression, the fighting spirit and solidarity of the working masses were higher than in previous strikes. The unity of the middle class with the strikers and demonstrators was also unprecedentedly strong. Particularly moving and unified was the strike in Genoa. All work in the port was stopped, city traffic was interrupted, and shops and most institutions and banks were closed. In Bologna, the working people forced the police to retreat and demonstrated in the city center for several hours, where they held a large rally. More than 70,000 people participated in the rally held in the Emilia region. The strike in Venice brought all businesses, waterworks, and transportation to a standstill. Rome became a battlefield of continuous clashes between working people and the police for five hours. In many parts of Rome, the working people waged an indomitable struggle against the brutal attacks of fully armed police.
