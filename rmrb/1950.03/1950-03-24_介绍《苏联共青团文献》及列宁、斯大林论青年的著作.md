Introducing "Documents of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League" and the Works of Lenin and Stalin on Youth

Recently, the China Youth Publishing House published several books related to the Soviet Youth League and youth work, including "Documents of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League," "Stalin on Youth," and "Lenin on Youth." These are very valuable books, and cadres working in the Youth League and young people should keep them on hand and read them frequently.

The All-China Student Federation Executive Committee passed a resolution to launch New Democracy study, and schools are carrying out New Democracy study. To understand and grasp this study policy, these books provide us with a lot of extremely important reference documents. Lenin's "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues" points out that the basic task of the Youth League is to study, and explains what to study and how to study. Stalin's "Letter to the Congress of Proletarian Students" more clearly stipulates the three tasks of proletarian college students: to become conscious builders of socialist economy and culture; to regard themselves as an inseparable part of the working masses, capable of gaining the trust and help of the masses; and to understand the necessity of mastering science, not to talk about politics emptily, but to truly master science. Stalin's words, as the direction of the efforts of Chinese youth today, are still of paramount guiding significance. In addition, Yezhova's report on school work at the Eleventh Congress of the Youth League, the Youth League's resolution on the report on school work, and the third paragraph of Mikhailov's report to the Central Committee of the Youth League also provide us with many valuable experiences in study and school work.

We have seen "The Young Guard" and "Zoya," and we all admire the noble qualities of the Soviet Young Communist League members. But how are these qualities cultivated? The Youth League's charter points out the reason: "The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League relies closely on the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union, and is its reserve force and assistant. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League educates its members in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, making them courageous, vigorous, unafraid of difficulties, confident in their own strength, and ready to overcome any obstacles in the struggle for the victory of communism."

If we read Mikhailov's report to the Central Committee of the Youth League, it is not difficult to understand that the performance of the Soviet Young Communist League members in the Patriotic War and in the work of national construction is exactly like this.

Of course, there are many other articles in these books worth introducing. Here, I only cite the two points about study and the qualities of Youth League members to recommend to young friends.

　　介绍《苏联共青团文献》及列宁、斯大林论青年的著作
    最近青年出版社出版了《苏联列宁共产主义青年团文献》、《斯大林论青年》和《列宁论青年》等几本有关苏联青年团和青年工作的书。这是几本极有价值的书，做青年团工作的干部们和青年们都应该拿它放在手边时常阅读。
    全国学联执委会通过了开展新民主主义学习的决议，各学校都在开展新民主主义学习。要了解与掌握这个学习方针，这几本书就给了我们不少极重要的参考文件。列宁的《论青年团的任务》，指出青年团的基本任务在于学习，说明了学什么与怎样学习的问题。斯大林的《给无产阶级大学生代表大会的信》更明确的规定了无产阶级大学生的三条任务：成为社会主义经济与文化的自觉的建设者；把自己看作是劳动群众不可分开的一部分，能够得到群众的信任与帮助；并且了解精通科学的必要，不能空洞的谈论政治，应该真正掌握科学。斯大林的话，作为今日中国青年努力方向，依然是具有头等指导意义的。此外，叶秀娃在共青团第十一届代表大会上所作关于学校工作的报告，及共青团关于学校工作报告的决议，还有米海洛夫在共青团中央委员会的报告中的第三段，也给我们在学习问题上，在学校工作上，提供了很多宝贵的经验。
    我们看过《青年近卫军》，看过《丹娘》，都非常景仰苏联共青团员们的高贵品质。然而这品质是怎么教养成的呢？共青团的团章给我们指出了这个原因：“全苏联列宁共青团靠紧联共（布）党，是它的后备军和助手。在共产党的领导下，全苏联列宁共青团以苏维埃爱国主义精神教育团员，使他们刚勇，朝气勃勃，不怕困难，深信自己的力量，准备在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中克服任何阻碍。”
    如果我们读米海洛夫在共青团中央委员会的报告，就不难了解，苏联共青团团员在卫国战争中，在建国工作中的表现也正是这样的。
    这几本书里的文章值得介绍的当然还有很多，这里只举出关于学习的和关于青年团员的品质两点来向青年朋友们推荐。
