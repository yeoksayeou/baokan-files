[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] "Chairman Mao is back!" Yesterday, the people of the capital exchanged this news in tones of infinite excitement and joy. Early in the morning, newsboys shouted along the streets, "Chairman Mao is back! See the news of Chairman Mao's return to the country!" The newspaper stands on the streets were crowded with people, and even rickshaw pullers gathered around. Everyone read the newspaper and gazed at the photos, feeling heartfelt gratitude for the happiness that Chairman Mao brought to the people of the whole country from Moscow.

The news spread to the factories and was immediately posted on big-character posters and blackboards. Many factories took advantage of lunchtime to read it aloud to everyone. After listening, the workers cheered and applauded. The eighth trade union group of the Dongdan Business Office of the Telecommunications Bureau immediately held a discussion. They unanimously stated that they would use their gratitude to intensify production to thank Chairman Mao and celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Lu Mao, a worker at the 70th Arsenal, said: Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union this time was a great success. After signing the Sino-Soviet treaty and agreements, he also visited various Soviet construction projects, which has a remarkable effect on the construction of our new China. The workers of the Jingwei Textile Mill jumped up with joy when they heard the news of Chairman Mao's return. Last night, all the workers in the factory held a symposium to discuss Chairman Mao's great achievements during his visit to the Soviet Union. In the end, everyone unanimously stated: We must quickly revise this year's production plan for our factory, make it better and more accurate, and guarantee to complete and strive to exceed the plan, and use this practical action to thank Chairman Mao, who has worked hard and made great contributions. Niu Ruichen and Jiang Shuying, female workers at the Renli Carpet Factory, said after reading the blackboard newspaper published by the trade union: Chairman Mao signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in the Soviet Union, bringing machines, loans, and valuable production experience, which will accelerate our country's construction. Zhang Zhiqing, the foreman of the overhaul team of the Tram Company Repair Factory, said: Chairman Mao has brought us so much happiness, and we workers have no other way to thank him except to show it in production. We must complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule.

	Farmers pledge: We must cultivate the land well to be worthy of Chairman Mao.

Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Municipal Farmers Association Preparatory Committee, said: The return of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou gives us great excitement. In order to quickly overcome the difficulties in the construction of New China, Chairman Mao personally went to the Soviet Union to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and loan agreements, and visited Soviet cities and factories to learn from experience, which will greatly shorten all the difficult processes in our country's construction. We want to thank Chairman Mao, and we wish Chairman Mao good health.

The news of Chairman Mao's return spread to the outskirts of Beijing, and the farmers told each other with incomparably joyous feelings. Fu Guoxing, the village head of Siwei Village in Nanyuan Town, and Wang Jun, the secretary of the village office, immediately ran to each household to tell them the news. Farmer Li Heting said: "Chairman Mao treats the farmers extremely well. This time, we turned over in the land reform. I must cultivate the land well to be worthy of Chairman Mao." In the evening, the farmers returned from production in the fields and went to the village office to inquire about the news of Chairman Mao's return. Everyone was talking about it happily. Farmer Chen Yunsheng said: "Chairman Mao signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in the Soviet Union, so let's farmers cultivate the land well." Hired laborer Chen Peilin said: "Chairman Mao led the poor people to turn over. This time he went to the Soviet Union to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which further guarantees our victory and world peace. I am unspeakably happy that Chairman Mao is back." The farmers who were holding a group meeting in the north room of the New Kailu Village Office courtyard heard the village cadre Yang Zongxiang shout, "Chairman Mao is back!" and men and women alike squeezed into the east room office to listen to Yang Zongxiang read the letter from the Nanyuan Town Office. Farmer Cheng Jinfu said: "Chairman Mao did a very big and good thing for us this time in the Soviet Union! We have completed the land reform and eliminated feudalism, so we must always produce well." Li Yunting, who is in his forties, said: "I have been counting the days on my fingers, and it is time for him to return. Chairman Mao brought back a lot of treasures from the Soviet Union. These treasures are revolutionary experience and production and construction experience, so it will be no problem for us to build an industrial country." Dong Shuhua and Zhang Jieru, farmers from Liulangzhuang in the Sixteenth District, said: Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union for the sake of us working people and for the sake of our construction. We must listen carefully to Chairman Mao's instructions in production to be grateful for Chairman Mao's kindness. Chairman Mao has put in so much effort for us, and if we don't do a good job in production, we will be too sorry for Chairman Mao.

The entire team of the Beijing Military Police, who served as the glorious honor guard, greeted Chairman Mao with unparalleled excitement. Zhao Yuxi, the captain of the Young Communist Party member, said: "Chairman Mao brought happiness and a guarantee of peace to the Chinese people back to Beijing.

Chairman Mao's health is the happiness of the people. With Chairman Mao, we have strength all over our bodies, and we are not afraid of any difficulties. From now on, we must respond to Chairman Mao's call and always be a fighting team, defending the country, defending the people, and defending Chairman Mao.

Liu Pengzhi, chairman of the student union, said: "Chairman Mao has done great things for the people and is now back. The great friendly assistance from our international friend, the Soviet Union, will further consolidate our victory. We students can only do a good job in New Democratic learning, learn the skills to build the motherland, and build our country to thank the Soviet Union for its friendly assistance."
