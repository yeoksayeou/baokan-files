After the establishment of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in 1945, the commemoration continued. It calls on democratic youth around the world to launch various activities during the annual World Youth Week to coordinate with the current struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth; to develop international youth solidarity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation; and to expand publicity and support for the World Federation of Democratic Youth, thereby strengthening the ranks of world democratic youth unity.

　　During this year's World Youth Week, youth organizations in various parts of China can organize various activities suitable for youth needs based on specific conditions, such as travel, evening parties, seminars, etc., and conduct publicity activities to promote the World Federation of Democratic Youth and strengthen youth's understanding of the international youth solidarity struggle (promotional materials can be based on "The World Federation of Democratic Youth and Its Activities Over the Past Four Years," which will be published soon by the China Youth Publishing House). In places where foreign democratic youth reside, various get-together activities can be organized. At the same time, the Chinese version of the World Federation of Democratic Youth publication "World Youth" will soon be published. Local areas should widely introduce it and solicit long-term subscribers so that the broad masses of youth can regularly understand the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the lives and struggles of youth from various countries, closely integrating the struggle of Chinese youth with the struggle of youth worldwide.
