　　Rinderpest Eradicated in Southern Hebei
    100,000 Head of Livestock Treated and Injected in Six Months; Sixteen Training Classes for Chicken Plague Prevention Established
    [Report from our Baoding correspondent] The outbreak of anthrax among cattle that occurred in southern Hebei Province at the end of last year has now been basically eradicated. Anthrax first occurred in Julu in December of last year, spreading to nine counties including Pingxiang, Renxian, Xingtai, Enxian, Guangzong, Shahe, Handan, and Jize. The Department of Agriculture of the Hebei Provincial People's Government successively dispatched four groups of epidemic prevention personnel, totaling thirty-nine people, carrying large quantities of vaccines and serums to the epidemic areas for prevention and treatment. With the active assistance of local governments, extensive epidemic prevention publicity, treatment, and injection work was carried out. Within twenty days, a total of 382 sick animals were cured, and 41,575 animals were given preventive injections. Seventy percent of the livestock in Julu County have been injected. Other counties adopted a key encirclement and prevention method, quickly eradicating the rinderpest.

    [Another report] The Department of Agriculture of the Hebei Provincial Government held a livestock epidemic prevention meeting in early this month. The meeting decided that in order to prevent anthrax in cattle, 450,000 head of cattle must be injected in 1950; in order to prevent hog cholera and chicken plague, 7,000 hogs and 1 million chickens must be injected. To this end, five epidemic prevention teams (ten people per team) will be organized to go to the countryside, combining with local government cadres to first do a good job in publicity, improve work efficiency, and require that half of the year's tasks be completed in the four months of spring. The province's livestock epidemic prevention teams have launched large-scale livestock epidemic prevention and control work since last year. From September of last year to January of this year, a total of 100,372 head of livestock have been treated and injected; 899 sick pigs have been cured; and 18,900 chickens have been given preventive injections. At the same time, sixteen training classes for chicken plague prevention have been set up in ten key counties including Dingxian, Tongxian, and Tianjin, training 260 chicken plague treatment personnel, half of whom are women. The government issued each person an injection needle and provided vaccines, and they launched injection work on the spot.
