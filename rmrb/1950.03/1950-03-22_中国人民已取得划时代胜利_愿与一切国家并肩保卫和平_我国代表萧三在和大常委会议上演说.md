Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 21st dispatch: TASS Stockholm dispatch: Chinese representative Xiao San said in his speech at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace on the 18th: The 475 million Chinese people are filled with the sincere desire to build their independent, democratic new country and their culture. The Chinese people want to heal the wounds inflicted on our country by the long and brutal war and restore the damaged economy. Peace is essential for us.

The Chinese people have suffered a lot in the past centuries due to years of war and are no longer willing to be the target of aggression.

Now the Chinese people have achieved an epoch-making victory and are willing to join hands with all other countries to defend global peace.

After defeating the American imperialist bandits—the puppet Chiang Kai-shek—the Chinese people have dealt an effective blow to American imperialism and the instigators of new wars. This not only consolidated the cause of peace in the Far East but also consolidated the cause of peace in all over the world. The conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union is an event of great importance and contributes to further strengthening peace throughout the world. This treaty embodies the fraternal friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance between the two peoples. It is a treaty to defend peace in the Far East and the world. The nearly 700 million people of these two great powers have united and are fighting side by side against aggression. This will surely strengthen the peace camp and increase our strength to fight for peace. This power makes the warmongers tremble. All peace-loving countries will be encouraged by this power and this unity.

Xiao San continued: We demand an end to colonial wars in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya, and the withdrawal of imperialist troops from these countries. We also demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. Let the Japanese people decide the fate of their country themselves. The American troops now stationed in Japan, get out!

We firmly oppose the American imperialists arming Japanese soldiers and using Japan as a tool for their aggressive policy in the Far East.

We oppose the so-called "Southeast Asia defense line" and oppose the Pacific Group that American imperialism intends to establish. We strongly protest against the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities by American bombers. American planes, American bombs, and American and Japanese pilots are shamelessly and brutally killing Chinese old people, women, and children. We oppose bacteriological warfare. We demand the extradition of criminals related to this atrocity, and we demand the trial of these people.

Dear friends, defenders of peace! We must be vigilant at all times. We must strengthen the peace movement, expand the connection between the Standing Committee and the national peace committees of all countries, we must consolidate organizations, and step up propaganda for the idea of defending the peace movement. We are not begging the warmongers for peace, we are demanding peace. We want to force the warmongers to stop preparing for new military adventures.

　　中国人民已取得划时代胜利  愿与一切国家并肩保卫和平
    我国代表萧三在和大常委会议上演说
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：中国代表萧三于十八日在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会会议上致词说：四亿七千五百万中国人民充满了真诚的愿望，希望建设他们独立的民主的新国家以及他们的文化。中国人民要医治长期的残酷战争使我们国家蒙受的创伤，恢复遭到破坏的经济。和平是我们所必需的。
    中国人民在过去的世纪中由于连年战争而遭受过很多痛苦，再也不愿成为侵略的目标。
    现在中国人民已取得了划时代的胜利，并且愿与一切其他国家并肩保卫全球和平。
    在打垮美帝国主义者的匪徒——傀儡蒋介石——之后，中国人民已给予美帝国主义和新战争挑拨者以有效的打击，这不仅巩固了远东的和平事业，而且巩固了全世界的和平事业，中华人民共和国与苏联之间的友好同盟互助条约的缔结，是一件具有极大重要性的事件，对于进一步地加强全世界的和平是有供献的。这个条约使两国人民的兄弟般的友好、同盟及互助具体化，它是保卫远东及全世界和平的条约。这两个大国的近七亿人民已团结起来，现正并肩地对侵略进行斗争。这一定会加强和平阵营和增加我们为和平而斗争的力量。这种力量使战争贩子们发抖。所有爱好和平的国家都会因为这种力量和这种团结而欢欣鼓舞。
    萧三继续说：我们要求在越南、印尼、马来亚等国家中停止殖民战争，并从这些国家撤退帝国主义的军队。我们并要求尽早缔结对日和约。让日本人民自己决定他们国家的命运。现在驻在日本的美国军队滚出去！
    我们坚决反对美帝国主义者武装日本军人，利用日本作为在远东的侵略政策的工具。
    我们反对所谓“东南亚防线”，反对美帝国主义打算成立的太平洋集团。我们坚决抗议美国轰炸机对中国城市滥施轰炸。美国的飞机、美国的炸弹以及美国和日本的驾驶员，正厚颜无耻地野蛮残忍地杀害中国的老人与妇孺。我们反对细菌战争。我们要求引渡与这种恶行有关的罪犯，我们要求审判这批人。
    亲爱的朋友们，和平的保卫者们！我们必须时时警惕。我们必须加强和平运动，扩大常设委员会和一切国家的全国和平委员会之间的联系，我们必须巩固组织和加紧宣传保卫和平运动的思想。我们不是向战争贩子乞求和平，我们是要求和平。我们要逼迫战争贩子们停止新军事冒险的准备。
