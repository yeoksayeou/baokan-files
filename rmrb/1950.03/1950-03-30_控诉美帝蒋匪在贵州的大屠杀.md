　　Accusations of the Massacre by American Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in Guizhou
　　·Han Zidong·
　　I escaped from the Sino-American Cooperation Organization's White Mansion in Chongqing in 1947. Recently, after seeing the exhibition of photos of the massacre by American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Chongqing, I felt particularly grief-stricken. This massacre by American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Chongqing was exposed because the bandits, in their panic and confusion under the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, did not have time to destroy the evidence. Such massacres occurred many times in Chongqing. In some cases, too much time had passed, and in others, the bodies of the martyred heroes were cremated, making it difficult to exhume them. Recently, I received a letter from a fellow prisoner who survived, in which he wrote about several tragic cases he witnessed. I have copied the letter below:

　　"Mr. Zidong: Thank you for your distant remembrance. ... Of those who escaped this time, not a single one was from Guizhou (Mr. Su Wenyu and I, along with dozens of others, were escorted to the White Mansion from Yanglangba, Guizhou, in 1946—Zidong's note). General Huang Xiansheng, Lieutenant Li, Lieutenant Yan, Zhang Xingmin, Xu Xiaoxuan, Tan Shenming, Wen Ze, Xuan Hao, He Zhongfu, and others did not escape the bloody jaws of the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. ... After you escaped from the White Mansion, the bandit spies were extremely panicked and terrified. All the agents in the concentration camp were mobilized in disguise, and they mobilized all the police and security forces near Chongqing to search for two weeks, using dozens of barrels of gasoline. After you escaped, the agents were even more vicious towards us, often beating and cursing us, but none of the prisoners were not extremely happy. Because everyone knew that getting out of the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service prison alive was harder than ascending to heaven. ... You escaped, and when we are all killed, we believe you will accuse the people and ask the people to demand that the American-Chiang Kai-shek pay this blood debt. The revolutionary wave will engulf the American-Chiang Kai-shek. About two or three months after you escaped, Shang Chengwen, Zhang Chang'ao, Zhu Nianqun, and others were burned to death by electric torture one evening (it is said that they were buried in the house, and cement was applied on top), and soon Wei Defu... and others were also killed. ..."

　　Su Wenyu, age twenty-two,

　　I accuse the people of China, and ask the people of the whole country to investigate how many massacres like the one in Chongqing occurred, and how many kind Chinese people and heroic revolutionary soldiers were brutally murdered by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The crimes of the American-Chiang Kai-shek in the White Mansion, Zhazidong, and Zaoshichang have been partially exposed. Their massacres in Qijiang, Guiyang, Xifeng, Kuaihuolin, Yanglangba, Hankou, Nanjing, Wangjiabao in Yiyang, and other places have not yet been exposed. Let me talk about Xifeng!

　　The Xifeng Sino-American Cooperation Organization training class commanded the killing factories within hundreds of miles from Guiyang to Tongzi, from Yangming Cave (where General Zhang Xueliang was imprisoned) to Xuantian Cave (where General Yang Hucheng was imprisoned), and from Yanglangba (where Luo Shiwen and Che Yaoxian were imprisoned) to Kuaihuolin. They called themselves "training classes" or "Chairman's (referring to the bandit Chiang) headquarters" to the outside world, but in fact, they were all secret concentration camps—killing factories. Many American agents lived in the Xifeng training class. Chiang Kai-shek had built a swimming pool and many buildings for their debauchery. Kuaihuolin in Xifeng was a place where people were often killed. The method of killing people was the same as the way General Yang Hucheng and his wife Song Qiyun were killed in Chongqing, extremely secretly. Unless you were locked up together, it was simply impossible to know who had been killed. It was common for people to be killed for a long time without those locked up together even knowing. For example, No. 334 (surnamed Wang, a journalist, whose name I forget) lived with me for several years, and we only found out that he had been killed a long, long time after he was murdered. Who can know how many people were killed in the killing factories within hundreds of miles commanded by the Xifeng training class of the Sino-American Cooperation Organization! Hua Shi, Zhang Mulin, Yang Guang, Zhang Lupi, Zhao Ligeng, Chen Guozhu, Wang Xizhen, Feng Mazi, and others are only a very small part of the total number of victims. The massacres by American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Chongqing, Xifeng, Yanglangba, Hankou, Yiyang, Qijiang, and Guiyang, in the words of Acheson, are the manifestation of the American imperialists' "inherent friendship" towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never forget the monstrous crimes committed by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits in China. The Chinese people will definitely make them pay for this blood debt!

### 控诉美帝蒋匪在贵州的大屠杀

　　控诉美帝蒋匪在贵州的大屠杀
    ·韩子栋·
    我是一九四七年从重庆中美合作所白公馆逃出来的。最近看了美帝蒋匪在重庆的大屠杀的照片展览，特别感到悲愤。美帝蒋匪在重庆这一次的大屠杀，是在人民解放军的神速进军下，匪徒们在慌忙混乱中来不及灭迹才暴露出来的。像这样的屠杀，在重庆是有很多次的，有的是时间隔得太久了，有的是被害烈士的尸首被焚化了，不容易发掘出来。日前接到幸免于难的一位难友的信，信上写着他亲眼看到的几次惨案。我把信抄在下面：
    “子栋先生：谢谢你遥远的怀念。……这次脱险的，除了我，从贵州来的没有一个人（苏文玉先生和我一共数十人是从贵州阳朗坝，在一九四六年押解到白公馆的——子栋注）。黄显声将军、李副官、阎副官、张醒民、许晓轩、谭沈明、文泽、宣灏、何仲甫等等都没幸免美帝蒋匪的血口。……你从白公馆逃出后，匪特们异常慌张惊恐，集中营里特务全化装出动了，他们并动员了重庆附近全部警宪搜查了两个礼拜，汽油用了几十大桶。你逃走后特务们对我们更凶恶了，时常打人骂人，但是犯人们没有一个不异常高兴的。因为谁也知道要想活着走出美蒋特务的监牢，那是比登天还难。……你跑出去了，到我们全被杀光的时候，我们相信你会向人民控诉，要求人民叫美蒋偿付这笔血债。革命的怒潮会把美蒋淹没的，你逃走后，大约两三个月吧，尚承文、张长鳌、朱念群等在一个黄昏被电刑烧死了（据说埋在屋里，上面打了三合土），不久魏德富……等也被杀害了。……
    苏文玉二，二十二，
    我向全中国人民控诉，请全国人民调查，像重庆的大屠杀到底有多少次，有多少善良的中国人民、英勇的革命志士，惨遭美帝蒋匪毒手。美蒋在白公馆、渣滓洞、造时场的罪行，已经被揭露一部分了。他们在綦江、贵阳、息烽、快活林、阳朗坝、汉口、南京、益阳王家大堡等地的大屠杀，还没被揭露出来。我说一说息烽吧！
    息烽中美合作所训练班指挥着从贵阳到橦梓、从阳明洞（囚禁过张学良将军的地方）到玄天洞（囚禁过杨虎城将军的地方）从阳朗坝（囚禁过罗世文、车耀先的地方）到快活林广袤数百里地以内的杀人工厂。他们对外称“训练班”、“委员长（指蒋贼）行辕”，其实都是秘密集中营——杀人工厂。在息烽训练班住着好多美国特务，蒋介石曾为他们修盖了游泳池和许多供他们淫乐的建筑物。息烽快活林是常常杀人的，杀人的办法和在重庆杀杨虎城将军宋绮云夫妇一样，极为秘密。除非被关在一起，就简直没法知道那些人是被杀了。被杀了好久，连关在一起的人都不知道，这是常有的事。例如三三四号（姓王，是一个新闻记者，忘其名）和我一连同住了几年，在他被杀害了很久很久，我们才知道。中美合作所息烽训练班所指挥的广袤数百里内的杀人工厂，谁能知道它一共杀了多少人！华始、张慕林、杨广、张露萍、赵立耕、陈国柱、王希珍、冯麻子等，只是被害者总数中很小的一部分。美帝蒋匪在重庆、息烽、阳朗坝、汉口、益阳、綦江、贵阳的大屠杀，借艾奇逊的话说，就是美帝对中国人民“固有友谊”的表现。中国人民永远忘不掉美帝蒋匪在中国制造的滔天罪恶，这种血债，中国人民一定要他们偿还！
