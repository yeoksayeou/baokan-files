    Li Jishen and Others Speak
    The Power of the Chinese People is Unprecedentedly Strong and Will Surely Shatter the US Imperialist Plot to Invade Taiwan

Following Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speech, Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, responsible person of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Peng Zemin, responsible person of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Xu Deheng, responsible person of the Jiu San Society, and Situ Meitang, Central Committee member of the China Zhi Gong Party, all exposed the US imperialist plot to continue to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan and actively support the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces to establish an aggressive base to undermine peace in the Far East and the world. They believed that Taiwan is an indivisible part of Chinese territory, and that liberating Taiwan is an urgent task. The people of the whole country should fully support the People's Liberation Army in completing this task. After the conference passed the letter to compatriots across the country and the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army, the meeting adjourned amidst shouts of "Long live the liberation of Taiwan," "Long live the liberation of all of China," "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live the Chinese Communist Party," and "Long live the People's Republic of China."

    李济深等讲话
    中国人民力量空前强大定能粉碎美帝侵台阴谋
    继朱总司令讲话者有中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、中国民主同盟副主席沈钧儒、郭沫若、中国民主建国会负责人黄炎培、中国农工民主党负责人彭泽民、九三学社负责人许德珩及中国致公党中央委员司徒美堂，他们一致揭露美帝国主义继续援助台湾蒋匪并积极扶植日本侵略势力再起以建立其破坏远东与世界和平的侵略基地的阴谋，并认为台湾为中国领土不可分割的一部分，解放台湾为当前急务，全国人民应全力支援解放军完成这一任务；中国人民革命力量已空前强大，加以中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，一定能粉碎蒋匪及美帝国主义的阴谋。大会在通过大会告全国同胞书及大会向毛主席、人民解放军的致敬电后，于高呼“台湾解放万岁”、“全中国解放万岁”、“毛主席万岁”、“中国共产党万岁”、“中华人民共和国万岁”口号声中散会。
