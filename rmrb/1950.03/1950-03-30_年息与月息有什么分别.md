　　What is the Difference Between Annual Interest and Monthly Interest?
    Question: In Di Chaobai's article "The Great Significance of the Sino-Soviet Loan Agreement," it says that in the past, when imperialists lent money to China, the Chinese people had to bear an annual interest rate of six percent (the highest reached a monthly interest rate of one point two percent). But we are unclear about "annual interest rate of six percent and monthly interest rate of one point two percent": Does the "point" referred to here equal ten times the "percent," or is there another explanation?
    If the "point" referred to here is equal to ten times the "percent," then isn't the monthly interest higher than the annual interest? If 1 million yuan is calculated at an annual interest rate of six percent or a monthly interest rate of one point two percent, what is the annual interest in each case? Also, what was the highest interest rate in the treaties signed by imperialists and the Chinese reactionary government in the past? (Qi Shuchen, Technical School of the Shenyang Railway Administration)
    Answer: (1) The difference between annual interest and monthly interest: A monthly interest rate of six percent means taking an interest of six per thousand per month. The calculation method is: principal × 6/1000. A monthly interest rate of one point two percent is: principal × 12/1000. An annual interest rate of six percent does not mean that only six per thousand of interest is taken for the whole year, but that the year is only counted as ten months for interest calculation. If the monthly interest is six per thousand, the annual interest is: principal × 6/1000 × 10.
    (2) Regarding the interest rate of imperialist loans to China, the highest one I could find in my materials was the Shanghai Mint's debt to Huachang Company in the tenth year of the Republic of China, with a monthly interest rate of one point five percent. The second highest was the outstanding amount owed by the old Beijing government's Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to the Sino-French Bank in the sixth year of the Republic of China, with a monthly interest rate of one point four percent. If we say that the interest rate on the above two loans was higher because they were in arrears, then the highest official loan should be the industrial loan (principal 5,021,875 francs) borrowed by the old Beijing government from the Sino-French Bank in the ninth year of the Republic of China, with an annual interest rate of one point two percent.

　　年息与月息有什么分别
    问：在狄超白所著的《中苏贷款协定的伟大意义》一文中说：过去帝国主义借款给中国，中国人民要负担年息六厘（最高的有达月息一分二）。但我们对于“年息六厘和月息一分二”弄不清楚：这里所指的“分”，是否等于“厘”的十倍，或者还有其他解释？
    如果这里所指的“分”等于“厘”的十倍时，那么是不是月利高于年利了呢？假如一○○万元按年利六厘或月利一分二计，那么每年的利息各是多少？又，以前帝国主义与中国反动政府所订条约，最高的利息高到什么程度？（沈阳铁路管理局技术学校  祁书臣）
    答：（一）年利与月息的分别：月息六厘是说每月取千分之六的利息。计算方法为：本金×６／１０００。月息一分二厘就是：本金×１２／１０００。年息六厘，并不是说全年只取千分之六的利息，而是把一年只作十个月计息。每月利息为千分之六，全年利息为：本金×６／１０００×１０。
    （二）关于帝国主义对华贷款的利率，在我手头所查得的材料中，最高的是民国十年上海造币厂对华昌公司的欠款，月息一分五厘。其次是旧北京政府农商部于民国六年欠中法银行的余欠，月息一分四厘。如果说以上两笔因为是拖欠，所以利息较大，那么在正式借款中，应推民国九年旧北京政府向中法银行所借的实业借款（本金五、○二一、八七五法郎），年息一分二厘为最高。（狄超白）
