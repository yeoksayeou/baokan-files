Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 19th: More than twenty counties in Jiangxi Province, including Dayu, Shangyou, Xinjian, Poyang, Chongren, etc., successively convened county-level people's representative conferences from early February to early March to discuss preparations for spring plowing and overcoming famine through production. At the representative conferences in various places, after repeated discussions and studies, the representatives generally enhanced their confidence in overcoming famine through production, and overcame the viewpoint of solely relying on government relief and the wait-and-see mentality of waiting for land distribution. The representatives generally realized that only by mobilizing the peasant masses to reduce rent and engage in self-salvation through production can they overcome the spring famine. For example, representatives from Poyang, Yujiang, Guixi, Nancheng, Yifeng, Yichun and other counties proposed to continue rent reduction and carry out social mutual assistance and relief, launch a campaign for non-disaster-stricken households with grain to save a handful of rice every day, and plant more early-maturing crops such as peas to shorten the disaster period. Regarding the difficulties in solving plowing cattle, seeds and farm tools in the spring plowing, representatives from various places also put forward specific opinions at the meeting. For example, farmer representatives from Poyang, Yongxiu and other places advocated organizing labor exchange and mutual aid groups under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, exchanging manual labor for cattle labor, jointly purchasing seeds and plowing cattle, and conscientiously implementing the ban on slaughtering plowing cattle and preserving seeds. Worker representatives from Yongxiu County promised to mobilize blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the countryside to repair or manufacture farm tools for farmers at relatively cheap prices. At the same time, representatives from various places also put forward specific guarantees for completing the agricultural production plans of various counties. For example, the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Ji'an County decided to mobilize and organize the peasant masses in all villages during the spring plowing to strive to apply eight loads of fertilizer per mu of field, three cultivations and three harrows, so that each mu of field can increase production by twenty catties of grain. The People's Representative Conference of all circles in Wuyuan County decided on this year's grain production increase plan: the county's 360,000 mu of fields will increase production by ten catties per mu, and 18,000 mu of wasteland will be reclaimed, striving to increase grain production by 7.2 million catties and produce 13,000 dan of tea.

　　江西廿余县召开各界代表会议
    讨论生产渡荒问题
    克服单纯依靠政府救济观点，将发动农民进行减租和生产自救。
    【新华社南昌十九日电】江西省大庾、上犹、新建、鄱阳、崇仁等二十余县，在二月初至三月上旬先后召开县各界人民代表会议，讨论准备春耕和生产渡荒等问题。在各地代表会上，代表们经过反复讨论和研究之后，普遍增强了生产渡荒的信心，克服了单纯依靠政府救济的观点和等待分地的观望思想。代表们一般都认识了只有靠发动农民群众进行减租和生产自救，才能渡过春荒。如鄱阳、余江、贵溪、南城、宜丰、宜春等县的代表均提出了继续进行减租和开展社会互助互济，发动非灾区有粮户每天节省一把米运动，多种豌豆等早熟作物以缩短灾期等办法。关于解决春耕中耕牛、种籽和农具困难等问题，各地代表在会上也分别提出具体意见。如鄱阳、永修等地的农民代表主张在自愿两利的原则下，组织换工互助组，以人工换牛工，合伙购买种籽、耕牛，并认真执行宰杀耕牛禁令和保存种籽等规定。永修县工人代表们提出保证，动员铁匠、木匠下乡，以较便宜的价格，给农民修理或制造农具。同时，各地代表对完成各县农业生产计划，也多提出了具体保证。如吉安县各界人民代表会议决定，要在春耕中动员和组织各村农民群众，争取做到每亩田施肥八担，三耘三耙，使每亩田增产二十斤粮。婺源县各界人民代表会议决定了今年粮食增产计划：全县三十六万亩田，每亩增产十斤，并开荒一万八千亩，争取做到增产粮食七百二十万斤，出产茶叶一万三千担。
