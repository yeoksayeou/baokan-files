　　Wind and sand swallow cultivated land, reducing agricultural production.

　　Traveling south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, from the Yongding River in the north to the Shahe River, we can often see vast stretches of desert. The accumulated sand in these large areas of sandy land constantly swallows other cultivated land with the help of wind. According to a survey of four villages, including Huangjia Village in Xinle County, Hebei Province, more than 1,500 mu of paddy fields have been turned into deserts in the past ten years. Fifty-three percent of the county's cultivated land is subject to wind and sand erosion and deteriorates year by year. In the spring of 1949, a sandstorm reduced the yield of 190,000 mu of wheat and peas in the county by 60%. Such deserts are widely distributed in North China, Northwest China, and other regions. Hebei Province alone has 1.39 million mu. The six counties of Xingtang, Quyang, Zhengding, Xinle, Wuji, and Gaocheng in western Hebei have more than 320,000 mu of pure desert. After the Kuomintang bandits and feudal forces were eliminated in these areas, wind and sand became the biggest enemy of local farmers' production. Local farmers said, "Whoever subdues the wind and sand, we will build a temple to commemorate him." We can imagine how eagerly the farmers need to conquer the deserts!

　　The best way to conquer deserts is afforestation. First, create windbreaks to protect farmland from wind and sand; further transform all sand fields into orchards, fertile fields, and forests. Before 1949, the people's governments of various counties also paid attention to mobilizing farmers to plant trees. However, the results were not significant at that time. It was not until after the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin that the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government convened a conference on afforestation in western Hebei to combat deserts in Zhengding, and established the Western Hebei Desert Afforestation Bureau, which further laid a favorable foundation for eliminating deserts.

　　Relying on the masses, nine million trees were planted in three seasons, with a survival rate of 80%.

　　In the past year, the Western Hebei Desert Afforestation Bureau, in conjunction with the local government, launched spring, rainy season, and autumn afforestation campaigns, planting more than nine million trees, teaching farmers scientific planting methods, increasing the survival rate to 81%, planting 30 windbreaks, stretching more than 40 miles, and establishing seven windbreak networks. Throughout the year, more than 56,000 mu of desert were eliminated. The achievement of this great achievement is due to the fact that the staff has mastered the most acute weapon of the Bolsheviks - relying on the masses. The Desert Afforestation Bureau was established in Nanhua Village, Zhengding, the central area of the desert, with only four cadres and their pre-paid food and vegetable money for two months. They did not complain about the lack of people and money. On the contrary, the afforestation cause was launched and made great achievements. The staff lived in the homes of farmers and worked closely with the cadres of various counties to start work. The spring afforestation campaign was launched. In one season, 127% of the annual plan was completed. The rainy season afforestation exceeded the number of trees planted in spring by 800,000 trees. Even in the autumn, when farmers did not have the habit of planting trees, more than 2.7 million trees were planted, only slightly less than in spring.

　　How did they rely on the masses, carry out their work, and achieve such great results?

　　Negotiate with the masses to determine the method of cooperative afforestation.

　　First, mobilize farmers to address their concerns about not benefiting from planting trees. Because farmers have seen the destruction of trees by the enemy, coupled with the destruction of grazing cattle and sheep and hooligans, they feel that planting trees will not grow. Their conclusion is: "Planting trees is a waste of effort." But in reality, farmers painfully watch the wind and sand harm the farmland, wanting to plant trees but being too lazy to do so. The Afforestation Bureau seized this central issue and, in conjunction with the local government, mobilized villages to do a good job in forest protection. Each village established a forest protection committee, democratically formulated forest protection covenants, and regularly sent people to inspect forest protection work. And stipulate the income distribution method to solve the land ownership disputes of sandy land. Therefore, it increased the confidence of farmers in planting trees. At the same time, vigorously publicize the benefits and methods of planting trees. Through the leading role of farmers and Communist Party members and Youth League members trusted by the masses, village-to-village and household-to-household challenge competitions were launched, inspiring farmers' enthusiasm for planting trees and setting off a huge afforestation campaign. Farmers in Xizheng Village, Xingtang, built a windbreak that was one and a half miles long during the afforestation campaign. Farmers in the desert area of Wuji County planted 110,000 trees sporadically in the spring.

　　The second is to organize the masses, solve difficulties, and carry out afforestation in a planned way. The Afforestation Bureau advocates "cooperative afforestation" (that is, to improve the original tree association organization of farmers), so that the individual interests and collective interests of farmers are closely combined, solving the difficulties of forest protection work, and also solving the difficulties of manpower and material resources when individual farmers plant trees. The scale of "cooperative afforestation" is large, which is convenient for the implementation of scientific methods of the Afforestation Bureau, improving the survival rate, and maximizing the effectiveness of windbreaks. Xingtang and other counties in western Hebei have various forms of cooperative afforestation groups. The farmers who participate in the cooperative group take good care of their trees. A larger organizational form is collective afforestation by the whole village or several villages. In the spring of last year, 41 villages in Xinle County mobilized more than 7,170 workers to plant 170,000 windbreaks. Such large-scale collective afforestation must pay attention to a sound organizational leadership and a reasonable distribution of forest product benefits.

　　Strengthen the guidance of planting technology.

　　Finally, strengthen technical guidance. The planting technology of the Afforestation Bureau is learned from the Soviet Union. The afforestation method is: plant windbreaks around the desert to limit the movement of the desert. Subsequently, a network of windbreaks is built within the forest belt to completely eliminate the desert. Each grid of the forest network has an area of about ten mu. The main forest belt plants five to ten rows of trees, and the auxiliary forest belt plants three to five rows. The plant spacing is about three feet on average, with dense planting as the principle. In this way, labor and seedlings are saved, and the sand prevention effect is enhanced. After the windbreaks are grown, orchards can be cultivated in the grid, and pasture or crops can be planted. At the same time, the Afforestation Bureau promoted the experience of farmers and improved the survival rate of planting trees in sandy land. In the past, local farmers did not know the three key points of "deep burial, tight compaction, and dense planting" when planting trees in sandy land, so the survival rate was very low. The Afforestation Bureau introduced the "bow-shaped layering method" created by farmers in northern Shanxi. The "bow-shaped layering method" is: use two willow branches more than three feet long, insert the two ends into a pit two feet deep two inches apart. Bend the middle into an arch, facing upward, slightly exposed to the ground (spring), exposed by one inch (rainy season) or buried in the soil by half an inch (autumn). In this way, the tree strips will root at both ends and sprout in the middle, and the survival rate will reach 80% to 90%.

　　植树造林消灭沙荒
    ——冀西一九四九年的沙荒造林工作
    萧颖
    风沙吞没耕地，减少农业产量。
    沿京汉线南行，北起永定河南至沙河，我们时常可以看见一片片广漠的沙荒。在这些大片的沙地上的积沙，又借着风力不断吞没其他耕地。据河北新乐县黄家庄等四个村调查，近十年以来，已有一千五百余亩水地变为沙荒。全县百分之五十三的耕地受着风沙的侵袭逐年变质。一九四九年春，一场风沙使全县十九万亩麦田及豌豆减产六成。这样的沙荒在华北、西北以及其他地区分布得很广。河北一省就有一百三十九万亩。冀西行唐、曲阳、正定、新乐、无极、藁城等六县就有纯沙荒三十二万多亩。这些地方，在蒋匪及封建势力被消灭后，风沙变为当地农民生产上的最大敌人。当地农民说：“谁要制服风沙，大家修庙纪念他”。我们可以想像农民们是怎样迫切地需要战胜沙荒呵！
    战胜沙荒最好的办法是造林。首先造防风林带，保护农田不再受风沙的侵害；进一步将全部沙原改造成果园、良田与森林。一九四九年以前，各县人民政府也都注意到发动农民造林。但由于当时成绩还不够显著。直到京津解放后，华北人民政府农业部在正定召开了冀西沙荒造林会议，成立冀西沙荒造林局，更进一步打下了消灭沙荒的有利条件。
    依靠群众三季植树九百万株，成活率达十分之八。
    一年来冀西沙荒造林局结合当地政府发动了春季、雨季和秋季造林运动，植树九百余万株，教会农民科学植树法，使成活率提高到百分之八十一，栽植防风林带三十处，绵延四十余里，建立七处防风林网。全年消灭沙荒五万六千余亩。这巨大成绩的获得，是由于工作人员们掌握了布尔什维克最锐利的武器——依靠群众的结果。沙荒造林局成立在沙荒中心区正定南化村，开始只有四个干部和他们预支的两个月的粮票菜金。他们并没有喊人少钱少没法办事。相反的，造林事业开展了，作出很大的成绩。工作人员住在农民家里，密切地配合各县干部开始工作。开展了春季造林运动。一季就完成了全年计划的百分之一百二十七。雨季造林又超过春季的株数八十万株。在农民没有植树习惯的秋季也种植了二百七十余万株，仅比春季少一万多株。
    他们是怎样依靠群众，进行工作，获得这样巨大的成绩的呢？
    通过群众商定合作造林的办法。
    首先，是发动农民解决他们怕栽树不能得利的顾虑。因为农民看到过去树木遭敌人的破坏，加上放牧牛羊的人与二流子的破坏，觉得栽树也不能长成。他们的结论是：“栽树白费力气”。可是实际上，农民心痛地看着风沙危害农田，心里想栽树而又懒得去栽。造林局抓住这一个中心问题，结合当地政府发动各村作好护林工作。村村成立护林委员会，民主制定护林公约，经常派人检查护林工作。并规定收益分配法，解决沙荒地权纠纷。因而增加了农民植树的信心。同时，大力宣传植树的好处和方法。通过为群众所信仰的农民和共产党员、青年团员的带头作用，发动了村与村、户与户的挑战竞赛，鼓舞了农民的植树热情，掀起了一个巨大的造林运动。行唐西正村农民们就在造林运动中建成了长达一里半的防风林。无极县沙荒区农民，在春季中零星植树就有十一万株。
    其次是组织群众，解决困难，有计划的进行造林。造林局提倡“合作造林”（就是把农民原有的树会组织加以提高），使农民们的个人利益和集体利益密切结合起来，解决了护林工作的困难，也解决了个别农民植树时人力物力的困难。“合作造林”的规模较大，便于实施造林局的科学方法，提高成活率，发挥防护林的最大效用。冀西行唐等县就有着各种形式的合作造林组。参加合作组的农民都很爱护自己的树木。更大一点的组织形式是全村或几个村的集体造林。在去年春季，新乐县四十一个村曾动员七千一百七十余工种植了防风林十七万株。这样大规模的集体造林，必须注意健全的组织领导，合理的分配林产利益。
    加强对植树技术的指导。
    最后是加强技术指导。造林局的植树技术是向苏联学习的。造林能方法是：在沙荒的周围，植上防风林带，限制沙荒的流动。随后在林带圈内造网状防风林，全面消灭沙荒。林网每格面积约十亩。主林带植树五至十行，副林带三至五行。株距平均约在三尺左右，以密栽为原则。这样，既省工又省苗，且防沙效力反而增强。防风林长成后，格内土地就可以培植果园，种植牧草或农作物。同时，造林局又推广农民的经验，提高了沙地植树的成活率。过去当地农民对沙荒植树，不知道掌握“深埋、紧砸、密栽”三要点，因而成活率很低。造林局就介绍了晋北农民创造的“弓形压条法。”“弓形压条法”是：用三尺多长的杨柳条两根，相隔二寸两头插入二尺深的坑中。当中弯成弓形，朝上，微露于地面（春季）、露出一寸（雨季）或埋入土内半寸（秋季）。这样，树条就两端生根中间抽芽，成活率的达到百分之八十到九十。
