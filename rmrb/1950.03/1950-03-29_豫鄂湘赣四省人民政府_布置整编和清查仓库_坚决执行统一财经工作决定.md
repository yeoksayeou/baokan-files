Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 27th: The People's Governments of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces in the Central South Region and their respective departments are cascading the communication and implementation of the Central People's Government's decision on unified national financial and economic work. To ensure the completion of the 1950 tax revenue targets and eliminate tax evasion, the Henan Provincial People's Government has issued a decision instructing all levels of government under its jurisdiction to strengthen leadership in tax collection and overcome the erroneous view of neglecting tax revenue. It has also consulted with the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and agreed to transfer capable cadres by the end of March to serve as directors of tax bureaus and chiefs of tax collection offices. To implement the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on public enterprises paying industrial and commercial taxes, the Kaifeng Municipal Tax Bureau convened a meeting on the 16th, gathering more than 20 units, including specialized trading companies dealing in oil, coal, grain, and other public enterprises. All participating units unanimously expressed their firm commitment to implementing this decision. In Hunan Province, warehouse inventory committees have been organized by the units under the Provincial Trade Department; Changsha City has also formed a compilation committee and a warehouse material inventory and allocation committee. The province and city's affiliated agencies are now stepping up the work of inventorying warehouses and streamlining staffing. In terms of grain transportation, in addition to stepping up transportation in various grain-producing areas, Hunan Province has decided to prioritize the transportation of high-quality grain from areas with convenient transportation throughout the province to other provinces. To ensure close coordination among the relevant departments in the grain transportation work, the Provincial Grain Bureau, Shipping Company, and Changsha Branch of the China Grain Corporation jointly formed a grain transportation headquarters on the 2nd of this month to unify the leadership of the province's grain transportation work; leading staff members of each unit personally went to the countryside to supervise the grain transportation work. The Jiangxi Provincial Compilation Committee was formally established on the 22nd of this month, and based on the staffing quotas stipulated by the Central People's Government, discussed the specific implementation methods and specific issues related to staffing in the province. The Hubei Provincial People's Government convened a meeting of cadres directly under the provincial government on the 24th of this month, where Deputy Governor Wang Renzhong conveyed the spirit of the Central Financial Conference and the decision of the Central South Financial Conference on implementing the Central Government's unified financial and economic work. He stated that Hubei Province guarantees the full completion of public grain and tax revenue tasks, and strives to exceed them; the task of promoting public bonds is limited to completion by the end of March; and the staffing will also be implemented strictly in accordance with the Central Government's regulations.
