　　Attempting to Continue Attacking the Filipino People
    US-Philippines Extend "Military Aid" Agreement
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] In order to continue attacking the Filipino people and actively plot to use the Philippines as a base for attacking the people of various Far Eastern countries, US imperialism has decided to extend the US-Philippines "Military Assistance Agreement" for two years. According to a report by the Associated Press: Representatives of the US and Philippine governments signed documents in Manila on the 11th of this month to extend the "Military Assistance Agreement," which was due to expire in 1951, to 1953. At the same time, they also signed documents to implement the so-called "Mutual Defense Assistance Act" passed by the US Congress in 1949. According to this bill, the Philippines, South Korea, and Iran can receive a total of 27.64 million US dollars in military "aid." Philippine officials announced on the 12th that the United States will ship more "military aid materials" to the Philippines in the future. According to Agence France-Presse's Manila dispatch on the 13th: The US government will hand over 50 fighter jets to the Philippines within two weeks.
    Note: In order to obtain "aid" from the United States to massacre the Filipino people and attack the Philippine People's Liberation Army (i.e., the People's Anti-Japanese Army), the reactionary Philippine government signed the "Military Assistance Agreement" with the United States in March 1947. The exchange condition for obtaining this "aid" was to sell out all of the Philippines' national defense sovereignty, sign the "Military Base Agreement," and allow the United States to maintain twenty-three military bases throughout the Philippines for a period of ninety-nine years, making the Philippines one of the important bases for US imperialism's aggression in the Far East. However, the US-Philippine reactionaries have failed to weaken the armed forces of the Filipino people as a result. This February, under the instructions of MacArthur and with the active participation of Anderson, head of the US "Military Advisory Group" in the Philippines, the Quirino government launched a "full-scale offensive" against the Philippine Liberation Army, which has made no progress to date. This renewal of the agreement by the US and Philippine reactionaries demonstrates their determination to be hostile to the Filipino people to the very end.

### 妄图继续进攻菲律宾人民  美菲延长“军援”协定

　　妄图继续进攻菲律宾人民
    美菲延长“军援”协定
    【新华社十五日讯】美帝国主义为继续进攻菲律宾人民，并积极策划以菲律宾为进攻远东各国人民的基地，已决定将美菲“军事援助协定”延长两年。据合众社讯：美菲两国政府代表已于本月十一日在马尼拉签订文件，将一九五一年满期的“军事援助协定”延长到一九五三年，同时并签订履行美国国会在一九四九年通过的所谓“防务互助法案”的文件。根据该法案，菲律宾、南朝鲜与伊朗可得总额二千七百六十四万美元的军事“援助”。菲律宾官方十二日宣布：此后美国将有更多的“军援物资”运菲。据法新社马尼拉十三日电称：美国政府将在两星期内拨交菲律宾战斗机五十架。
    按：菲律宾反动政府为取得美国的“援助”，以屠杀菲律宾人民和进攻菲律宾人民解放军（即民抗军），曾于一九四七年三月间与美国签订了《军事援助协定》。取得这一“援助”的交换条件，是出卖菲律宾的全部国防主权，签订《军事基地协定》，允许美国在全菲各地保有为期达九十九年的二十三个军事基地，使菲律宾成为美帝国主义侵略远东的重要基地之一。但美菲反动派并未能因此达到削弱菲律宾人民武装力量的目的。今年二月，季里诺政府在麦克阿瑟的指示与美驻菲“军事顾问团”团长安德逊的积极参与下，对菲解放军发动了“全面攻势”，迄今毫无进展。美菲两国反动派这次续订新约，表现他们敌视菲律宾人民到底的决心。
