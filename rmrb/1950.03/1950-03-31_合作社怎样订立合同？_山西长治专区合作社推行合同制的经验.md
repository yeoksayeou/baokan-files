How Should Cooperatives Establish Contracts?
    ——Experience of the Changzhi Special District Cooperatives in Shanxi Province in Promoting the Contract System

Through the implementation of contract management with state-owned trading companies, and between cooperatives, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties under the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province have initially played a good role in linking rural small producers with state-owned economic organizations in the exchange of materials. This has also provided new experiences for further rationally organizing urban and rural trade.

In November and December of last year, Changzhi, Pingshun, Huguan, Lucheng, Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping, Lingchuan, Changzi and other nine counties signed a total of 1,501 contracts, including 1,221 exchange contracts, 216 purchase contracts, 52 order contracts, 3 sales contracts, and 9 transportation contracts. Exchange contracts were mostly used between county cooperatives and village cooperatives. Pingshun County Cooperative and village cooperatives signed 189 exchange contracts in two months, accounting for more than 74 percent of the county cooperative's total contracts. Purchase and order contracts were mostly used between county/village cooperatives and state-owned trade organizations. For example, Pingshun County/village cooperatives signed 65 purchase and order contracts with state-owned economic organizations, accounting for slightly less than 26 percent of the county cooperative's total contracts.

The Contract is a Link Closely Connecting the State-Owned Economy and Rural Small Producers

This proportion is very obvious. It can be seen that through the linking role of contracts, the direct exchange of industrial and agricultural products has indeed been realized, reducing intermediate exploitation, closely connecting the state-owned economy and the individual economy, partially overcoming blindness, and strengthening the planned nature of industrial and agricultural production. For example, in two months, Pingshun and Lingchuan County Cooperatives helped 120 village cooperatives sell more than 99,000 catties of walnut kernels to the Changzhi Branch of the Native Produce Company, and exchanged them for more than 102,000 catties of salt, more than 43,100 feet of homespun cloth, more than 5,800 feet of foreign cloth, and more than 1,900 catties of kerosene from state trade organizations. In addition, Lucheng's straw hat braid industry, due to contract stipulations on certain specifications, has not only greatly increased sales after fine processing, increasing farmers' income, but also organized rural handicraft workers to directly serve the completion of this aspect of the state-owned economy's plan.

The preliminary experiences and lessons learned by the Changzhi Special District Cooperatives from adopting the contract system are as follows:

First, when promoting the contract system, all levels of cooperatives and state-owned economic organizations, if they can truly implement the policy of supporting production, connecting urban and rural trade, and serving the masses in their actual work, and can truly follow the mass line in their working methods, the contract can be promoted quickly and completed smoothly, and small producers can be organized through the contract. Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with 55 village cooperatives to purchase walnut kernels, organized the masses of 53 villages to crack walnut kernels, and sold more than 58,000 catties of walnut kernels. In contrast, Sima Village Cooperative in Changzhi County did not consult with the masses in advance, but signed a contract with the county cooperative to purchase hemp skins. When purchasing hemp skins from the masses, the masses felt that the specifications were too strict, and as a result, the contract became a piece of waste paper.

Organize Supply and Marketing Voluntarily for the Benefit of Both the Government and the Masses

Second, to do a good job in urban-rural mutual assistance through contracts, it is also necessary to grasp the political and economic situation, and organize the supply and marketing network on the basis of the interests and requirements of the government and the masses, and on the basis of the masses' willingness and mutual benefit. When Changzhi County Cooperative signed a contract with the Changzhi Branch of the Native Produce Company, the bank, and the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to pay public grain on their behalf, the county cooperative first determined the approximate number, price, specification, and method of paying public grain on behalf of the acquired hemp skins, and then sent four cadres to 45 hemp-producing villages to convene village cadres and members' meetings to explain the benefits of paying public grain on their behalf, and the price, specification, and time of hemp skins, and organized everyone to discuss them. Then, the members voluntarily reported and discussed the number of hemp skins to be sold, and finally the village cooperative and the county cooperative formally signed a contract to pay public grain on their behalf. The contracts signed in this way were all completed very well. In 20 days, a total of 175,000 catties of hemp skins were sold and 112,000 catties of public grain were paid on their behalf. Compared with the market price at the time, the masses benefited 58.98 million yuan and saved 1,870 labor units each for human and animal transportation. The opposite approach was a failure. For example, Qin County signed an exchange contract with the Changzhi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to exchange hemp seeds for cotton. However, Qin County Cooperative did not seize this need of the masses and mobilize the masses on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. It only focused on relying on the retail department for sporadic exchanges. Therefore, only 10,000 catties of cotton were exchanged, and the task was not completed on schedule.

Grasp the Situation, Gradually Develop, and Prevent Any Party from Suffering Losses

Third, in the case of price fluctuations, it is necessary to grasp the market situation, regional differences, commodity parity, and based on physical parity, calculate carefully, and take the method of small quantities, short time, and many times to gradually develop. This avoids the impact of price fluctuations and prevents any party from suffering losses. Pingshun County Cooperative, County Branch, and Nan Jiao Village Cooperative in the Fourth District, because they grasped the market situation and calculated capital, freight, and damage, and found a reasonable parity, they dared to purchase peach and apricot kernels at a higher market price ratio. Within a month, 13 contracts were gradually signed, each ranging from several hundred catties. Not only did they sell 6,400 catties of peach and apricot kernels and 350 catties of pepper, but also exchanged 17 stone of millet, 1,050 catties of salt, and 18 catties of cotton. However, Tunliu County Cooperative and the Changzhi Branch of the Grain Company signed a contract to exchange 30,000 catties of cotton for wheat. Because they did not grasp the commodity parity, the quantity ordered was very large, and the time was very long, as a result, due to price changes, 120,000 catties of rice and wheat could not be paid. It is estimated that this time they will lose 40,000 catties of grain. (Editor's Note: After the price stabilizes, this experience should be appropriately revised.)

Fourth, the contract should specify more detailed items, such as goods, quality, standards, numbers, prices, delivery procedures, time, location, responsibilities, and so on. Some contracts have also experienced some twists and turns because they were not specific, clear, and easy to implement. For example, Huguan County Cooperative and Haitou and Shanghaolao Village Cooperatives in the Second District ordered 110,000 catties of black alum, and the county cooperative paid 50,000 catties of public grain on its behalf. The contract only generally stipulated that the county cooperative was "responsible for delivering it to the warehouse," but did not specify which warehouse it would be delivered to. Later, the higher authorities stipulated that the public grain in the Second District should be transported to Changzhi, which raised the issue of freight. After many discussions, the government resolved it through allocation.

After the Contract is Signed, it Must be Frequently Inspected to Ensure the Realization of the Business Plan

Finally, there is also a very important experience, that is, after the contract is signed, it cannot be assumed that everything is fine. There must be continuous supervision and inspection. The Changzhi Special District Cooperatives generally abided by credit and paid attention to timely inspection and mutual supervision when fulfilling the contract. Therefore, they ensured the realization of the business plan and the completion of the contract as scheduled. For example, Pingshun County Cooperative and the Changzhi Branch of the Native Produce Company, because they have always paid attention to credit and inspection, have not only developed the contract system, but also closely linked the relationship between the two parties. However, some cadres of the cooperative also have the idea that "the public is their own people," or a purely profit-seeking point of view, and do not pay attention to credit, relax inspection, and affect the fulfillment of the contract. When Yangcheng County Cooperative signed a contract with a chemical factory in November last year to make wooden boxes, three village cooperatives took the money and bought and sold goods several times, originally wanting to make more money. As a result, prices rose, and they could not even afford the raw materials for making wooden boxes. These village cooperatives finally collapsed due to losses. The county cooperative, because it relaxed inspection, affected the completion of the planned production plan.

　　合作社怎样订立合同？
    ——山西长治专区合作社推行合同制的经验
    山西长治专区所属各县供销合作社，由于在业务经营上，与国营贸易公司，以及社与社之间，采取了合同经营方式，在农村小生产者与国营经济机关的物资交换上，已初步发生了良好的纽带作用，并为进一步合理地组织城乡贸易提供了一些新的经验。
    长治、平顺、壶关、潞城、晋城、阳城、高平、陵川、长子等九个县去年十一、十二两个月内，共订立合同一五○一次，其中交换合同一二二一次，代购合同二一六次、订购合同五二次、代销合同三次、运输合同九次。而交换合同多采用于县社与村社之间，平顺县社与村社，两个月来订了交换合同一百八十九次，占该县社合同总数的百分之七十四强。代购、订购合同则多采用于县村社与国营贸易机关之间，如平顺县、村社与国营经济机关就订了代购、订购合同六十五次，占该县社合同总数的百分之二十六弱。
    合同是一条纽带密切国营经济和农村小生产者的连系
    这个比例是很显而易见的，可以看出经过合同这一纽带作用，的确实现了工农产品的直接交换，减除了中间剥削，密切了国营经济与个体经济的关系，并部分地克服了盲目性，加强了工农业生产的计划性。如平顺、陵川两县社两个月中，除帮助一百二十个村社向土产公司长治分公司推销九万九千余斤核桃仁外，并向国家贸易机关换回食盐十万二千余斤，土布四万三千一百余尺、洋布五千八百尺、煤油一千九百余斤。此外，如潞城的草帽辫业，由于合同规定了一定的规格，经精细加工后，不仅销路大增，增加了农民的收入，而且把农村手工业者也组织起来，直接为完成国营经济这一方面的计划而服务。
    关于长治专区合作社由于采取合同制所得到初步经验教训如下：
    第一，各级合作社以及国营经济机关，在推行合同制时，凡在实际工作中，能切实贯彻为扶助生产、沟通城乡贸易，为群众服务的方针，并在工作方法上能真正走群众路线的，合同就能推行得快，完成得顺利，并经过合同把小生产者组织起来。平顺县供销社与五十五个村社订立了收购核桃仁合同，组织了五十三个村的群众敲核桃仁，并推销了核桃仁五万八千余斤。与此相反的一种做法，如长治县司马村社，事先没有和群众商量，即与县社签订收购麻皮合同，当向群众收购麻皮时，群众嫌规格定的太严，结果，合同便变成了一张废纸。
    依政府和群众需要自愿两利组织供销
    第二，要经过合同做好城乡互助，还必须掌握政治与经济情况，依据政府和群众的利益及要求，在群众自愿与两利的基础上，组织好供销网。长治县合作社在与土产公司长治分公司、银行、专区供销合作社订立代缴公粮合同时，先由该县社把收购麻皮的数目字、价格、规格及代缴公粮的办法大致确定后，即先派了四个干部分赴四十五个产麻村，召开村干部和社员大会，说明了代缴公粮的好处，和麻皮的价格、规格、时间等问题，并组织大家进行了讨论，然后由社员自报公议，定出推销麻皮数字，最后再由村社和县社正式订立代缴公粮合同。这样订的合同都完成得很好，二十天的时间，共推销麻皮十七万五千斤，代缴公粮十一万二千斤。如与当时市价相比，群众得利五千八百九十八万元，并节省人畜运输力各一千八百七十个工。相反的一种做法则是失败的，如沁县与长治专区供销社订了交换合同，以大麻籽换棉花，但沁县社没抓紧群众这一需要，本自愿两利的原则去发动群众，只着重靠门市部去零星交换，所以，仅交换了一万斤棉花的任务，还没有按期完成。
  掌握情况逐步发展  不使任何一方吃亏
    第三，在物价波动情况下，必须掌握市场情况，地区差额、货物比价，并根据实物比价，精打细算，采取数量少、时间短、次数多的办法，来逐步地发展。这才避免了物价波动的影响，不使任何一方面吃亏折本。平顺县社、县分社及四区南蛟村社，就是由于掌握了市场情况，以及计算了资金、运费、伤损，找出了合理的比价，才敢于以高于市价比例收购桃杏仁。一个月内，即逐步订了十三次合同，每次数百斤不等。不但推销了桃杏仁六千四百斤、花椒三百五十斤，还换回小米十七石、盐一千零五十斤，棉花十八斤。而屯留县社和粮食公司长治分公司订了三万斤棉花交换小麦的合同，由于没有掌握了货物比价，订的数量又很多，时间又很长，结果因物价变动，致使十二万斤的米麦无法支付，据估计这一次要赔四万斤的粮食。（编者按：物价平稳后，这条经验应当适当修改。）
    第四，订合同应规定比较详细的项目，如货色、品质、标准、数目、价格、交货手续、时间、地点、应负责任等等。有些合同因为订的还不够具体、明确、易行，也曾发生过一些波折。如壶关县社和二区海头、上好牢两村社订购黑矾十一万斤，由县社给代缴公粮五万斤，这个合同上只笼统地规定由县社“负责交到仓库”，却没写清楚交到那个仓库。后来上级规定二区的公粮运交到长治时，这就发生了运费问题。经多次商讨，才由政府用调拨办法解决。
  合同订后须常检查保证业务计划实现
    最后，还有一个很重要的经验，就是合同订立之后，不能认为万事大吉，必须有不断地督促检查。长治专区合作社在履行合同时，一般都遵守了信用，注意了及时检查，互相监督。因此，才保证了业务计划之实现，和合同的如期完成。如平顺县社与土产公司长治分公司，因为一向注意信用和检查，不仅发展了合同制，并从而密切了双方的关系。但是也有一些合作社的干部，存在着“公家都是自己人”的想法，或单纯营利的观点，不讲信用，放松了检查，影响了合同的履行。阳城县社去年十一月和化学工厂订做木箱合同时，有三个村社拿到款后，即买卖货物周转了几次，原想多赚些钱，结果物价高涨，连做木箱的原料都买不起了。这几个村社终于因赔钱垮了台。而县社因放松了检查，致影响了预定生产计划之完成。二月二十三日于北京
