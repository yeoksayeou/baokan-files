Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: As a result of the implementation of unified management of national railway finances, an unprecedented new situation of balanced operating revenue and expenditure has emerged. In January of this year, operating revenue of railways within the customs area increased by one-half compared to the best month of September last year, and more than doubled the monthly average revenue of last year. The phenomenon of railway bureaus such as Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Hengyang needing substantial state subsidies in the past no longer exists. On the contrary, in the two and a half months from January 1st to March 16th this year, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government was able to allocate more than 20 billion yuan from the operating revenue of various bureaus to pay for state-invested engineering costs, timely supporting important construction projects that have already commenced. The new financial system of unified management of national railways enables the operating revenue of railways across the country to be remitted to the People's Bank of China in various regions on the same day via telegraphic transfer to the General Treasury of the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Railways then uniformly allocates funds based on the budgets of each bureau and uniformly allocates cash according to priorities, ensuring the rational use of all operating revenue. The past phenomenon of unbalanced development among various railway bureaus has thus been overcome. For example, last year, the Shanghai Railway Bureau had high operating revenue and relatively abundant finances because it was the starting station for cargo; while the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau had low revenue, sometimes even insufficient to cover employee salaries. Now, under unified management, the method of "taking from the rich to supplement the poor" is adopted to enable the balanced development of each railway bureau. At present, the Ministry of Railways is preparing to streamline the national railway staffing, training surplus personnel into various business and technical personnel to increase production. At the same time, it strives to increase operating revenue, economize on various unnecessary expenses, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in operating revenue this year, and hand over depreciation reserves and business tax to the state.

　　全国铁路财政实行统一管理
    营业收支已达平衡
    一月份较去年每月平均收入增加一倍以上
    【新华社二十三日讯】全国铁路财政由于实行统一管理的结果，已出现了空前未有的营业收支平衡的新局面。今年一月份关内铁路营业收入较去年最好的九月份增加了二分之一，较去年每月的平均收入则增加一倍以上；去年郑州、太原、济南、衡阳等路局需要国家大量贴补资金的现象现在已没有了；相反，中央人民政府铁道部在今年一月一日起到三月十六日的两个半月中，还能自各局营业收入中抽拨二百余亿元的巨款垫付国家投资的工程费，及时地支持已经动工的重要修建工程。全国铁路的统一管理的新财务制度，使全国各铁路的营业收入都能在当天解交各地人民银行电汇铁道部总金库，再由铁道部统一根据各局预算拨款，并按轻重缓急统一调拨现金，使全部营业收入得到合理使用。过去各路局发展不平衡的现象也因而克服。如去年上海铁路局因是货物起运站，营业收入多，财政比较富裕；而郑州铁路局则因收入少，有时甚至不够开支员工薪资。现经统一管理，采取抽肥补瘦办法，使各路局能够平衡发展。目前铁道部正准备精简全国铁路编制，把编余的人员培养成各种业务技术人员，以增加生产；同时努力增加营业收入，撙节各种不必要的开支，争取今年度营业收入自给，并交付国家折旧准备金和营业税。
