[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Over the past year, political and ideological education in the capital's middle schools, through political class instruction and school administrative, Party, and League work, combined with various other social activities, has achieved significant success in eradicating reactionary ideological remnants and establishing a new outlook on life. To ensure a more systematic approach to political education in middle schools, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, in conjunction with relevant departments, formed the "Secondary School Political Course Teaching Committee" to specifically lead and assist in the advancement of political class instruction. The committee clarified the task of political class as teaching internationalism and patriotism and stipulated that, starting from the spring semester of 1950, the political textbook for junior middle school grades one and two would continue to be "Revolutionary Story Reader." For junior middle school grade two, based on students' level and needs, preliminary common knowledge about basic issues of the Chinese revolution would be added as appropriate. Students in junior middle school grade three and above would uniformly study the Common Program, divided into seven parts: General Program, Organs of Political Power, Military System, Economic Policy, Cultural and Educational Policy, Ethnic Policy, and Foreign Policy. A half-year plan for studying the Common Program is currently being drafted and will be announced soon.

In the spring semester of 1949, most middle schools in Beijing established political classes successively. Before the summer vacation, "The Current Situation of China and the Chinese Revolution" served as the main content of study, initially eliminating the skeptical mentality towards the Communist Party and the People's Government caused by the long-term distorted propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Schools coordinated instruction using materials such as "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "The History of Social Development," "Political Economy," "Youth Cultivation," "New Outlook on Life," and "Reader of Political Common Sense." All grades also covered topics such as "The Sino-Soviet Problem," "The Land Reform Problem," and "The Transformation of Intellectuals."

After the summer vacation, the Bureau of Culture and Education stipulated the political textbooks for each grade: junior middle school grades one and two would study revolutionary stories; after the promulgation of the Common Program, the focus would be on "Five Loves" education; junior middle school grade three to senior middle school grade three would study "Reader of the Chinese Revolution," with the content being basic issues of the Chinese revolution, combined with current affairs education, such as the White Paper issue, Sino-Soviet friendly relations, the People's Political Consultative Conference Common Program, support for the world peace movement, people's representative conferences at all levels, the October Revolution, and Stalin's birthday. During this semester, the education played a significant role in eliminating students' illusions about U.S. imperialism, establishing a correct understanding of the Soviet Union, and in the education of new patriotism and civic morality.

However, the teaching content before the summer vacation generally lacked system and sufficient planning, and there were also phenomena of detachment from reality, such as "Youth Cultivation" being too dry and "Political Economy" and "On New Democracy" being too profound, making it difficult for students to understand. Although the leadership proposed "basic issues of the Chinese revolution" as the main content after the summer vacation, it did not explicitly specify that internationalism and patriotism should be the focus of education. Therefore, although political teachers actually taught a lot of relevant materials, they consistently failed to achieve planned and step-by-step instruction. Since the establishment of the "Secondary School Political Course Teaching Committee," it plans to formulate plans suitable for the situation of most schools under a clear direction, hold lectures closely related to teaching, and specifically help political teachers in teaching, which will more effectively promote political education in middle schools.

In addition to political classes, schools have also achieved remarkably significant results in students' ideological education through various extracurricular activities, such as celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China, celebrating Stalin's seventieth birthday, organizing various exhibitions, visits, collective theater and film viewing, and organizing youth lectures and grand reports. In the future, the teaching of political classes in Beijing's secondary schools will surely achieve more significant results based on the continuous efforts of political teachers to improve their professional skills.

　　首都各中学进行政治教育一年
    学生初步建立新人生观
    今年上学期政治课本已确定
    【京市新闻处讯】首都各中学的政治思想教育，去年一年通过政治课教学和学校行政、党、团工作，结合其他各种社会活动，在肃清反动思想残余与建立新的人生观等方面都获有很大的成绩。为了使中学政治教育更有系统地进行，市文教局特会同有关部门组成“中等学校政治课教学委员会”，具体领导和帮助政治课教学的推进，明确政治课的任务为进行国际主义与爱国主义的教学，并规定自一九五○年春季开学起，各中学初一、二年级政治课读本续用“革命故事读本”，初二根据学生程度和要求，酌量增加有关中国革命基本问题的初步常识。初三以上一律学习共同纲领，分总纲、政权机关、军事制度、经济政策、文化教育政策、民族政策和外交政策等七部分进行。学习共同纲领半年计划正在草拟中，不日即可公布。
    一九四九年春季开学时，北京多数中学即先后设立政治课，暑假前以《中国现状与中国革命》为学习的主要内容，初步消除了由于受国民党反动派长期歪曲宣传所造成的对共产党和人民政府所抱的怀疑心理。各校配合着《中国革命与中国共产党》、《社会发展史》、《政治经济学》、《青年修养》、《新人生观》和《政治常识读本》等教材进行教学，各年级都还讲过《中苏问题》、《土改问题》、《知识份子的改造》等。
    暑假开学后，文教局曾规定了各级政治课读本：初一、二学革命故事；在共同纲领公布后，着重进行“五爱”教育，初三至高三学《中国革命读本》，内容为中国革命基本问题，并结合时事进行教育，如白皮书问题、中苏友好关系、人民政协共同纲领、拥护世界和平运动、各界人民代表会议、十月革命、斯大林寿辰等。这一学期间，在消除学生对美帝国主义的幻想、对苏联建立正确的认识，在对新爱国主义和国民公德的教育上起了不小的作用。
    但是在暑假前的教学内容上，一般是缺乏系统，计划性不够，也有脱离实际的现象，如《青年修养》太枯燥，《政治经济学》、《新民主主义论》太深，学生不易了解。暑假后领导上虽提出以“中国革命基本问题”为主要内容，但对于把国际主义与爱国主义作为重点进行教育一点没有明确，因此虽然政治教员在实际上讲了不少有关这方面的教材，但始终未能做到有计划、有步骤的进行。自“中等学校政治课教学委员会”成立后，拟在明确的方针下，订出适合多数学校情况的计划，举办与教学密切结合的讲座，具体帮助政治教员教学，这将会更有效地推进中学的政治教育。
    除了政治课外，各校还通过各种课外活动，如庆祝中华人民共和国成立，庆祝斯大林七十寿辰，组织各种展览、参观、集体观剧、观影，组织青年讲座和大报告等，对学生的思想教育也都起了异常显著的效果。今后京市中等学校的政治课的教学，在政治教员不断努力提高业务的基础上政治课教学的进行一定会有更加显著的成效。
