TASS, Karachi, March 28th: The Pakistan Times reports: The Pakistan General Federation of Trade Unions, through a proposal by its General Secretary Afsar, calls on Pakistan's farmers, democratic student organizations, intellectuals, and the middle class to hold a National Petition Day on April 2nd. In his proposal, Afsar declared: "In recent months, we have witnessed mass struggles by workers throughout the country. These struggles are the result of increasing unemployment, poverty, and wage reductions. The current government leaders, who are also the leaders of the Muslim League, are issuing false promises to improve the lives of the masses. They violate the interests of millions of people, engage in corruption, speculation, and suppress the people, subordinating the interests of the country to those Anglo-American imperialists. All these actions have enlightened the people, who have begun to recognize the nature of our rulers and have launched fierce struggles against them. Now, all the oppressed people of Pakistan should establish a broad democratic front based on their demands for employment, economic security, and democracy; and unite the separate struggles into a general mass struggle to fight for the establishment of a people's democratic government. The time for this has now arrived."

　　巴基斯坦总工会号召  建立广泛的民主战线  为建立人民民主政府而斗争
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩二十八日讯：巴基斯坦时报消息：巴基斯坦总工会通过该会总书记阿夫萨尔的建议，号召巴基斯坦的农民和民主学生组织，知识分子以及中等阶级，在四月二日举行全国请愿日。阿夫萨尔在建议中宣称：“在最近数月中，我们亲眼看到了工人在全国各地的群众斗争。这种斗争是失业贫穷增长和工资减低的结果。目前政府的领袖们，也就是回教联盟的领袖们，他们发出改善人民群众生活的虚伪诺言。他们违反千百万人民的利益，腐化、投机和镇压人民，把国家的利益隶属于那些英美帝国主义者。所有这些行为启发了人民，他们开始认识了我们的统治者的本质，并向他们发动了猛烈的斗争。现在，巴基斯坦所有被压迫的人民，应该在他们对职业、经济和民主的要求之基础上，建立广泛的民主战线；并把分离的斗争团结成为建立人民民主政府而奋斗的一般群众斗争，现在，这样的时机已经到来了。”
