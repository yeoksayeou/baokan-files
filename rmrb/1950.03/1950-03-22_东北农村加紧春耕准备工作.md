Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. Rural areas in Northeast China are intensifying their spring ploughing preparations. Songjiang Province has listed this work as the central task at present. Liaoxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang and other provinces are also simultaneously focusing on preparing for spring ploughing while engaging in sideline production. Heilongjiang Province has dispatched more than 60 cadres to Keshan, Hailun and other six counties to help with spring ploughing preparations. Liaodong Province has convened a provincial people's representative conference, focusing on arranging this year's large-scale production campaign, and seriously summarizing the experience of organizing labor mutual aid last year. Some counties in Songjiang Province have organized work teams to go to districts and villages with better organized mutual aid to summarize the experience of labor mutual aid in order to promote it.

According to the needs of farmers, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong provinces plan to promote more than 50,000 pieces of improved farm tools. Heilongjiang Province is also preparing to test dozens of sets of new-style horse-drawn mechanical farm tools, and other provinces will also test them with a focus. Farmers in three districts of Shulan County, Jilin Province, have ordered more than 400 pieces of improved farm tools, including 60 weeding machines ordered by farmers in Shentun Village, Baiqi District. This village will use this type of farm tool for weeding all the land this year.

With the vigorous promotion of governments at all levels, farmers are also paying attention to the selection of seeds. Farmers in various counties of Songjiang Province selected 6,827,700 jin of the "Man Cang Jin" (Full Granary Gold) high-quality soybean seeds during last year's autumn harvest, and more than 68,984,000 jin of other crop varieties. Heilongjiang Province alone, the three counties of Keshan, Dedu, and Hailun have decided to promote 710,000 jin of high-quality soybean seeds, with a planned planting area of 40,000 mu.

The amount of fertilizer applied in various places this year is generally higher than last year. Songjiang County has now delivered all the manure, and the fertilized area has reached 60 percent of the total cultivated area. The amount of fertilizer applied in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, has increased by one-third compared with last year, with each mu of land receiving four to five carts of manure. All localities are preparing to send all the accumulated manure to the fields before spring ploughing.

In coordinating with farmers in preparing for spring ploughing, local banks and cooperatives have played a significant role. The Northeast Bank used 120 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in spring agricultural loans to purchase a large number of new-style farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, soybean cakes, etc., and with the assistance of local governments and cooperatives, has begun to distribute them to farmers. The Rehe Provincial Cooperative Federation has also purchased nearly 300,000 jin of early-maturing crop seeds such as barley, wheat, and buckwheat from other places for farmers. Shangzhi County Cooperative in Songjiang Province bought more than 1,300 pieces of improved farm tools, preparing to lend them to mutual aid groups.

The rich harvest of winter sideline production in various places has also ensured the smooth progress of spring ploughing preparations. Farmers in Zhaoyuan, Taikang, and other eight counties in Heilongjiang Province have used their income from sideline production to purchase more than 1,660 carts and more than 2,400 head of livestock. Linjiang and Ji'an counties in Liaodong Province have also bought more than 1,800 head of livestock and more than 300 carts.

　　东北农村加紧春耕准备工作
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北各地农村正加紧进行春耕准备工作。松江省已将这一工作列为目前的中心任务，辽西、吉林、黑龙江等省亦同时以准备春耕为主结合进行副业生产，黑龙江省并派出六十余名干部，分赴克山、海伦等六县帮助准备春耕工作。辽东省已召开了全省人民代表会议，着重布置了今年的大生产运动，并认真地总结了去年组织劳动互助的经验。松江省有些县则组织了工作队，到组织互助较好的区村总结劳动互助的经验，以便推广。
    黑龙江、松江、吉林、辽东四省根据农民的需要，拟推广改良农具五万余件。黑龙江省并准备试用数十套新式马拉机械农具，其他各省也将有重点地试用。吉林省舒兰县三个区的农民订购了四百多件改良农具，其中白旗区之申屯村农民订购了六十件锄草机，该村今年将全部使用此种农具锄地。
    在各级人民政府大力提倡下，农民对选择种籽也很注意。松江省各县农民，在去年秋收中即选出“满仓金”优良大豆种六百八十二万七千余斤，其他作物品种六千八百九十八万四千多斤。黑龙江省仅克山、德都、海伦三县即决定推广优良豆种七十一万斤，计划播种四万亩。
    各地今年的施肥量普遍比去年增加。松江县现已全部送完粪，施肥面积达到总耕地面积的百分之六十；辽东省宽甸县施肥量较去年增加三分之一，每亩地送粪达四车至五车。各地都准备于春耕前将全部积粪送到地里。
    在配合农民进行准备春耕工作上，各地银行和合作社均起了很大的作用。东北银行以一万二千亿元（东北币）的春季农业贷款，购买了大量的新式农具、种籽、肥料、豆饼等，在各地人民政府与合作社的协助下，已着手发放给农民。热河省合作总社也为农民从外地采买大麦、小麦、荞麦等早熟作物种籽近三十万斤。松江省尚志县合作社买了一千三百余件改良农具，准备贷给互助组。
    各地冬季副业生产的丰富收获，也保证了春耕准备工作的顺利进行。黑龙江省肇源、泰康等八县农民将副业生产收入增购车一千六百六十余辆，牲畜二千四百多头。辽东省临江、辑安两县也买进牲畜一千八百多头，车三百余辆。
