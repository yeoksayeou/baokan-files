Guizhou Martyr's Posthumous Works from Prison

Recently, the preparatory committee for the memorial service for revolutionary martyrs of Guizhou, held by all sectors of Guiyang City, solicited information on the life stories, posthumous works, and photographs of the martyred revolutionary heroes. Mr. Li Zhongqing sent a short song, a poem, and two poems harmonizing with the original rhyme of "Feeling Inspired," all of which were posthumous works from prison by a certain martyred hero in his collection.

Short Song:

"…Since my heart is firm, bitter juice tastes sweet; I have studied for thirty years, distinguishing truth from falsehood in an instant. I look up without blaming fate, I look down without blaming others; Born in a great era, I bow only to fulfill my duty. There are still days for labor, carefully protect this five-foot frame; Great righteousness requires sacrifice, so what is there to hesitate! I do not miss my life before me, all old debts are wiped clean; I do not worry about what comes after me, there will be successors. Life is a long-term war, small defeats lead to great victories; Victory brings more confidence, forgetting personal selfishness, beckoning are giants, Prometheuses."

Poem:

"How many journeys have I walked on rugged roads, my heart originally wanting to save the perilous倾倾 (qīng qǐng - meaning dangerous state or situation); Lonely yellow flowers lock the deep courtyard, dense fog covers the ancient city. Enduring torment can inspire ambition, sympathy is seen in shared pain; I urge you to face the bright side, and your heart will be peaceful and your spirit full."

The following two poems are “Respectfully Harmonizing with the Original Rhyme after Reading ‘Feeling Inspired’,” as the author himself noted at the end. "Feeling Inspired" is likely also from a comrade in prison, but unfortunately, we do not know what kind of work it is. The author also noted, "My lung disease seems to be recurring lately, I cannot polish it, please correct me." The poems are:

"Strange news arises everywhere this year, calming the mind and steadying the soul; Cruelty is not a new invention, struggle leaves its mark everywhere."

"Stealing fire from heaven with iron courage, bearing the disaster under the mountain; (Prometheus stole fire from heaven, angered God, and was punished to suffer under the mountain, with iron eagles tearing at his liver) Civilization cannot be obtained easily, a gentleman never eats idly."

The above works were sent by martyr Li Ce (martyred on January 18, 1941, in the air-raid shelter of the pseudo-Guizhou Security Office) from prison to his second younger brother (i.e., Li Zhongqing) in a letter dated December 15, 1940. The letter said: "Enclosed are the posthumous works of a friend who has died for his beliefs, please preserve them properly, these are all treasures for the museum in the future." On a separate piece of paper, he wrote: "This poem (referring to the first poem – Liu Yu's note), short song, and the other two poems are all by the same person. …The author died for his beliefs on the evening of the 7th of this month." It has been exactly ten years since the incident, but unfortunately, we do not know who this "friend who died for his beliefs" actually was.

(Liu Yu, sent from Guiyang City on January 7, 1950)

### 贵州殉难者狱中遗作

　　贵州殉难者狱中遗作
    日前，贵阳市各界追悼贵州革命殉难烈士大会筹备会，征集殉难烈士生平事迹、遗著和照片等。李仲卿先生将其所收藏之某殉难烈士狱中遗著短歌一首、诗一首与和“感赋”原韵诗二首一并送来。
    短歌：
    “……心志既坚实，苦汁甘如饴；读书三十年，真伪辨须臾。仰不怨天命，俯不怪人非；生当大时代，鞠躬唯赴义。服劳尚有日，慎保五尺躯；大义须舍身，慷慨亦何辞！不恋我身前，陈账一笔除；不虑我身后，后事有人继。人生持久战，小败大胜利；胜利多信心，遗忘个人私，招手有巨人，普罗米修士。”
    诗：
    “走尽崎岖路几程，寸心原欲救危倾；寂寞黄花锁深院，浓雾迷漫罩古城。忍受折磨堪励志，相关痛痒见交情；劝君正向光明面，心自安祥气自盈。”
    下面的两首，系作者“读‘感赋’有感敬和原韵”，这是作者自己在篇末注明了的。“感赋”想亦系出自狱中同志之手，惜不知其为何种作品。作者还在后边注上“日来肺病有复发之象，不能推敲，请教正”等字样。其诗为：
    “年来处处有奇闻，安定心灵镇定魂；残酷并非今创举，斗争何地不留痕？”
    “铁胆天宫盗火种，剥坑山下祸自担；（普罗米修士盗火天宫，震怒了上帝，罚他在剥坑下受刑，用铁老鹰抓他的心肝）文明不许探囊取，君子原来不素餐。”
    以上作品，系李策烈士（一九四一年一月十八日殉难于贵阳伪保安处防空洞中）于一九四○年十二月十五日自狱中致其二弟（即李仲卿）信中寄出。那封信上说：“兹有殉道朋友遗作附上，望妥为保存，此皆他年博物馆中之珍物也。”又在另纸上写道：“此诗（指前诗一首——刘雨注）与短歌及另诗两首，均为一人所作。……作者于本月七号晚殉道。”事情过去已整整十年了，惜不知此“殉道朋友”究系何人？
    （刘雨一九五○年一月七日寄自贵阳市）
