Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th -- The entire citizenry of Guangzhou is actively participating in the work of the anti-bombing struggle. Under the leadership of the workers, citizens from all walks of life are actively engaged in repair and rescue work, and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Anti-Bombing Movement Committee has been established. The Municipal People's Government and the Garrison and Public Security organs also issued emergency air defense orders on the 3rd. Workers have demonstrated exemplary behavior in the repair work after the bombing. Automatic telephone workers repaired the wires and poles in the bombed area within four hours; electrical workers repaired most of the damaged wires within a day; railway machinery workers repaired the two locomotives damaged by the bandit aircraft strafing on February 24th through a day of intense work. Doctors and nurses from nine public and private hospitals in the city actively treated injured citizens after the bandit aircraft wreaked havoc on the 3rd. Many hospital directors and chief physicians also went to the disaster area to rescue the wounded and participated in carrying stretchers. District governments in various districts have established shelters to provide relief to refugees. At present, the People's Governments and Public Security Sub-bureaus in each district have convened meetings with street offices, residents' groups, and neighborhood patrol teams to specifically deploy various anti-bombing tasks. The Air Defense Command has also issued a notice stipulating the establishment and improvement of air defense organizations; all factories, institutions, troops, and citizens must dig and build air-raid shelters and air defense walls, and prepare anti-poison equipment; all materials stored in warehouses, docks, stations, and factories, especially flammable and explosive dangerous goods, should be evacuated; residents in the city without fixed occupations should be evacuated to the countryside; fire prevention and rescue work should be strengthened, and sufficient water storage should be prepared; and rumor-mongering and sabotage by special agents and bandits must be strictly prevented. The Southern Daily also published an editorial calling on all citizens to urgently mobilize and step up the struggle against bombing.

Also, Hong Kong and Kowloon workers are extremely indignant at the Kuomintang bandit aircraft bombing of Guangzhou. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers' Union sent a telegram of condolences, expressing their willingness to fully support the anti-bombing struggle of the people of Guangzhou.
