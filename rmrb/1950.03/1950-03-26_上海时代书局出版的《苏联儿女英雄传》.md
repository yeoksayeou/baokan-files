The Shanghai Times Bookstore's Publication of "Heroic Sons and Daughters of the Soviet Union"
苦艾

Soviet literature and art are the good teachers and helpful friends of the Chinese people. However, due to the differences in languages, excellent Soviet literary works must be translated before they can be introduced to Chinese readers. This is an arduous task. Translators must approach this work with absolute seriousness and a sense of responsibility to the people, because even technical negligence can lead to political errors.

The recently published "Heroic Sons and Daughters of the Soviet Union" (translated by Gu Cangsheng, Sun Siming, Liu Zengting, and Zhang Qiujie) by the Shanghai Times Bookstore is, however, a terrible translation.

This book, "Heroic Sons and Daughters of the Soviet Union," consists of fourteen short stories, all depicting the moving stories of young Soviet men and women sacrificing for their country during the Great Patriotic War (original title: "Stalin's Soldiers"). However, upon looking at the table of contents, one sees titles like "The Scholarly Soldier" (original title: "Malik Gabdullin"), "The Doctor Who Breaks His Own Arm" (original title: "Dr. Chekmakov"), "Inseparable as Branches" (original title: "The Glinka Brothers"), "Steel Forged a Hundred Times" (original title: "The Steelworker Sharonova"), "Far-Reaching and Important" (original title: "A Matter of Honor"), all in the decadent style of Saturday School literature.

This kind of writing style is also found everywhere in the translation. For example, "A tall, neat girl with black hair" is translated as "A graceful and well-proportioned maiden with raven hair," and "We will win" is translated as "Singing triumphantly." "In the vast and splendid world of books" is translated as "In the myriad of books, shining brightly."

This decadent Saturday School style of writing should have disappeared from the new literary and art circles long ago, but unexpectedly, there are still people today who use Soviet literary works to spread it.

Now, let's see if it is faithful to the original. Let's pick the article "A Daughter of the People" (should be translated as "Zoya's Life Story") to examine it. (The translation is based on the English translation, and we also use the English translation to check it.) The errors are extremely numerous. For example:

"...until the last minute, she retained complete faith in life, believing in the enthusiasm of all the Soviet people and the joy it brings." (Translation, page 46) How can one "believe in the enthusiasm of all the Soviet people"? What does "it brings" refer to? On the surface, the translation seems smooth, but upon closer examination, it is completely confusing. The original should actually be translated as:

"...she maintained full faith in life until the last minute, with all the enthusiasm of us Soviet people and an understanding of the joy of life."

"...willingly offering our hearts to strive for victory..." (Translation, page 46) This sentence is also ambiguous. The original contains the idiom "heart and soul," which should be interpreted as wholeheartedly, but the translator treats each word of the idiom separately and explains them individually. According to the original, this sentence should be:

"...willing to wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to the cause of victory..." This is significantly different from his translation.

"...for Zoya, books were a window, opening to reveal a vast world, still closed, which she could not yet approach." (Translation, page 48)

This vague translation can only have two interpretations: first, the window of books is still closed; second, opening the window of books reveals a world that is still closed. But neither explanation makes sense. The meaning of the original is that the world of books is a window for Zoya leading to a vast world that she cannot yet approach. That is, Zoya is too young to enter the real vast world, but she is educated and learns about the world through books. The translator completely misunderstood this point, giving the reader the impression that Zoya has not yet opened the window of books, or that she opened the window of books but saw nothing, because she only saw a "still closed" world.

There is also a ridiculous example that shows how the translator's cleverness backfired. In the original, it is written that when Zoya was reading, she read about Chernyshevsky's imprisonment, enduring humiliation but remaining steadfast. The following continues, "...Zoya had read Lenin's book 'How to Behave?' and wrote in her diary: 'I would rather die than submit to a person without love.'" (Translation, page 49) We know that Lenin wrote a famous book called "What Is to Be Done?" (not "How to Behave"), but Chernyshevsky wrote a novel with the same name before Lenin (there are two Chinese translations, one named "He Wei" and one named "What Is to Be Done"). The original does not say here that it was written by Lenin or Chernyshevsky. But it can be asserted that it is definitely not Lenin's work, because Lenin's book "What Is to Be Done?" does not mention love at all. Where did Zoya's feelings come from? The original clearly writes that Zoya read about Chernyshevsky's imprisonment and then read "What Is to Be Done?", which clearly indicates Chernyshevsky's novel. Only knowing that Lenin has such a book, but not knowing that Chernyshevsky has a novel with the same title, therefore, the translator's cleverness backfired!

The above are just a few examples from two or three pages of the translation. There are many errors, both large and small, in this short work, so I will not list them all.

Finally, I think I should further explain to the reader that this book was published by "Shanghai Times Bookstore" (not "Times Publishing House"), and the bookstore's irresponsible and unfaithful translations are not limited to this book alone. For example, the published Babaevsky's "Knight of the Gold Star" (should actually be translated as "Hero Awarded the Gold Star"). The content is only a part of the whole book, without beginning or end, and the translator and publisher do not state this, making the reader think that this is the original appearance of the work. At the same time, the translation is also full of errors.

　　上海时代书局出版的《苏联儿女英雄传》
    苦艾
    苏联文艺是我们中国人民的良师益友。但由于两国语言文字的不同，苏联的优秀的文艺作品必需经过翻译才能够介绍给中国读者。这是一个繁重的任务。翻译工作者必须抱绝对严肃的、对人民负责的态度来从事这个工作。因为即使是技术上的疏忽也可能造成政治上的错误。
    最近上海时代书局出版的《苏联儿女英雄传》（顾苍生、孙斯鸣、刘曾艇、张秋洁译），却是一个糟糕的译本。
    这本《苏联儿女英雄传》包括十四个短篇，完全是描写苏联在卫国战争时期，青年男女为国牺牲可歌可泣的故事（原名是《斯大林战士》），可是一翻目录，看见的题目是什么《戎马书生》（原名《马立克·加渤德林》），《良医折肱》（原名《契玛可夫医生》），《连枝比翼》（原名《葛林卡兄弟》），《钢成百炼》（原文《铸造女工莎隆诺》），《致远任重》（原名《荣誉问题》），这一类陈腐的礼拜六派的笔调。
    这种笔调，在译文中也到处都是。例如：“一个高高的，齐整的，长着黑头发的少女”译为“亭亭玉立，身段四称的少女，头发乌黑，”“我们会胜利的”译为“高唱凯歌”。“在广大的灿烂的书本世界中”译为“充栋汗牛，彪炳灿烂的群书中”。
    这种礼拜六派的文字，早就该绝迹于新文艺界的，却不料今天还有人借苏联文艺作品来传播它。
    现在，看看它是否忠实于原文，就挑“人民之女”（应译为“左雅的生活故事”）一篇来检查一下吧。（译本是根据英译本重译的，我们也根据英译本来检查。）那错误实在是多极了的。例如：
    “……直到最后的一分钟，她始终对生命保有完全的信念，相信全苏人民的热情和了解其所带来的快乐。”（译本四六页）怎叫“相信全苏人民的热情”？“其所带来”是什么带来？表面上似乎译文是通顺的，但一细想，就完全糊涂了。原文其实应译成这样：
    “……她以我们苏维埃人的一切热情和对于生之欢乐的领会，保持了对生命的充分信念，直到最后一分钟。”
    “……欣然贡献出我们的心灵，以争取胜利……”（译本四六页）这一句也是似是而非，在原文中有heart and soul这个成语，应解释为全心全意，但他竟把组成成语的每个字个别看待，单独解释。照原文这句应为：
    “……乐于全心全意地献身于胜利的事业……”这与他的译文是有显著的不同。
    “……对于左雅，书籍是一道窗户，推开可以望见广大的世界，尚在关闭着，她暂时不能临近。”（译本四八页）
    这句含糊不清的译文，只可能有两个解释：一、书籍这道窗户尚在关闭着；二、推开书籍的窗户望见尚在关闭着的世界。但无论哪一解释都不好讲。原文的意思是书籍的世界对于左雅是通向她暂时还不能接近的广大世界的一道窗户。也就是说左雅的年龄太小，还不能跨入真正的广大世界，但她通过书本而得到教育，而认识了世界。译者把这一点完全弄错，使读者得到的印象是左雅还没有打开书籍的窗户，或者是，打开了书籍的窗户，却什么也没有看见，因为她只看见一个“尚在关闭着”的世界。
    另外还有一个可笑的例子，可以从而看出译者自作聪明反而弄巧成拙。在原文中，写到左雅读书时，曾读到车尔尼雪夫斯基入狱，受尽凌辱仍坚忍不屈的情况，下面就接着说“……左雅熟读过列宁著的《如何自处？》这部书，在她日记中写下：‘宁死不向一个没有爱的人屈服。’”（译本四九页）我们知道，列宁写过名为《做什么》（并非《如何自处》）的著名的书的，但车尔尼雪夫斯基在列宁之前写过一篇小说，也是这个名字（已有两个中译本，一名《何为》，一名《做什么》）原文在这儿并没有说是列宁所作或车尔尼雪夫斯基所作。但决不是列宁的著作，是可断言的，因为列宁的《做什么》这一本书中并未谈到半点恋爱，左雅的感想从何而来呢？原文明白的写着，左雅读过关于叙述车尔尼雪夫斯基被囚情形，接着读了《做什么》，这明显的表示了是车尔尼雪夫斯基的小说。只知道列宁有这么一本书，却不知道车尔尼雪夫斯基有一本同样题名的小说，因而自作聪明弄巧反拙了！
    前面只是在两三页译文中举出几个例子，这短短的一篇作品里大小错误还很多，就不一一列举了。
    最后，我觉得应该向读者再说明一点，这书是“上海时代书局”（并非“时代出版社”）出版的，而该书店出版的译品的不负责，不忠实，还不只是这一本书而已。例如所出巴巴叶夫斯基的《金星骑士》，（实际应译作《得金星勋章的英雄》）。内容则仅是全书的一部分，没头没尾，译者及出版者也不加以声明，使读者以为这就是原作的本来面目，同时译文也是错误很多。
