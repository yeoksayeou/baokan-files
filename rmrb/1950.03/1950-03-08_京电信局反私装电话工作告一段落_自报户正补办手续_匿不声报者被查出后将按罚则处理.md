Beijing Telecom Bureau's Campaign Against Unauthorized Telephone Installations Concludes
　　Self-Reporting Users Complete Procedures
　　Those Who Conceal and Fail to Report Will Be Penalized

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Beijing Telecom Bureau's campaign against unauthorized telephone installations has now concluded. During the campaign, many unauthorized users were able to self-report and register. For example, user number ○一九八 of a certain bureau, who had privately installed an extension, took the initiative to write a letter on January 3rd to self-report. User number 二二三○ of a certain bureau had privately installed a jack. A certain factory, a three-bureau user, had removed the Telecom Bureau's original wall-mounted phone and replaced it with a privately purchased desk phone without going through the proper procedures, all voluntarily wrote to the Telecom Bureau or registered at the business office, admitting their mistakes and requesting to complete the necessary procedures. As of February 23rd, there were as many as 115 such users. Among these 115 users, unauthorized relocation of phones was the most common, accounting for more than half. Unauthorized installation of extensions and unauthorized replacement of phones were next. The Telecom Bureau has notified these users to pay the fees and complete the procedures, and will not impose penalties. However, user number某号 of the seventh bureau, who privately moved their telephone without reporting it, was discovered by telephone workers and charged double the relocation fee according to regulations. Thanks to the diligent inspection work of the telecom workers, hundreds of violations have been discovered. The campaign against unauthorized installations has only concluded in terms of publicity work; the investigation work will continue at any time and universally. This month, the user's downlines and handsets will be comprehensively repaired, and unauthorized and private installations will eventually be discovered. It is hoped that users who have privately installed extensions, attachments, privately moved or replaced phones, misreported information, or falsely reported types will no longer delay and will report themselves as soon as possible.

　　京电信局反私装电话工作告一段落
    自报户正补办手续
    匿不声报者被查出后将按罚则处理
    【本报讯】北京电信局发起的反私装电话运动，现已告一段落。运动中，不少私装用户，均能自报登记。如某局○一九八号私装了一部副机，在一月三号首先去函自报。某局二二三○号私装了一个插扑，三局用户某工厂未办手续私自把电信局原装的墙机取消，改装了自购的桌机，都自动向电信局去信或向营业处登记，承认错误，要求补办手续。像这样的用户截至二月二十三日止已经有一百一十五户之多。这一百一十五户中以私自移机的最多，占半数以上。私装副机、私自换机的次之。电信局对这些用户，已分别通知缴费并补办手续，不按罚则处理。而七局某号用户，私自移动电话机不声报，被电话工人查出，照章加倍收取移费。由于电信工人认真执行勘查工作，目前已查出数百个违章用户，反私装运动目前只是在宣传工作上告一段落，调查工作嗣后将随时和普遍的进行。本月将全面整修用户下线和话机，违章和私装用户迟早总要被发觉的。希望私装副机、附件、私自移机换机，名实不符，冒报种类等用户，勿再拖延，及早自报。
