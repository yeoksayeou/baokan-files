Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd - People's Liberation Army units across the country extensively carried out campaigns to support the government and cherish the people during the Spring Festival period, further strengthening the bonds between the military and the people. Before launching these campaigns, all units conducted ideological education on supporting the government and cherishing the people, and reviewed past instances of mass discipline. Incidents that violated the interests of the masses were addressed through compensation and apologies.

	Southwest Military Region: Troops Inspect Discipline, Donate Rice to Relieve Poor People
	The Southwest Military Region combined the tasks of supporting the government and cherishing the people with the mission of building the Southwest, conducting in-depth ideological education to ensure that commanders and fighters clearly understood that supporting the government and cherishing the people was an important guarantee for completing the task of building the Southwest. They then consolidated military-civilian relations through discipline inspections and joint military-civilian celebrations. Some units, when stationed in the suburbs of Chongqing, had purchased pigs at low prices. After a strict review, a compensation team was organized, led by responsible cadres from the regiment level, and divided into regions to provide compensation to each household; a mass meeting was also convened to publicly review the matter and offer a solemn apology. Some units that had borrowed items from residents without writing receipts also provided written acknowledgements. During the Spring Festival period, units directly under the Southwest Military Region and the Guizhou and Eastern Sichuan Military Regions donated more than 20,000 catties of rice to relieve impoverished farmers and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Troops in various locations universally helped the masses carry water, coal, firewood, dig wells, and perform other tasks.

	East China Troops: Support Work-Study Students, Help Farmers with Work
	From February 26th to 28th, troops stationed in Hangzhou under the East China Military Region mobilized for three consecutive days to support the work-study labor of students in Hangzhou's schools, helping them demolish city walls, dig earth, and transport stones. When the soldiers arrived at the construction sites, carrying the banner of the "Support Work-Study Student Labor Brigade" and beating gongs and drums, the students applauded enthusiastically. While working hard, the soldiers taught the students how to dig mud and demolish walls. During breaks, the soldiers sang northern liberation tunes and told stories of battles; the students responded by singing "The People's Liberation Army March" in gratitude. All the students who participated in the work were moved by the excellent qualities of the People's Liberation Army in being diligent and loving the people, greatly increasing their enthusiasm and efficiency. Troops on the front lines of Eastern Zhejiang helped farmers dig sweet potatoes in the mountains during breaks in their missions. Around the Spring Festival, continuous spring rains on a certain island on the front line threatened to rot the sweet potatoes stored by the farmers. The island garrison immediately exchanged rice for the potatoes, eating the ones that were about to rot themselves.

	Central South Military Region: Soldiers Rush to Build Dikes, Farmland Spared from Floods
	During the Spring Festival, the Central South Military Region and units of the Fourth Field Army cooperated with local governments to conduct major discipline inspections, implement compensation, and offer apologies. A certain unit stationed in Yichang conducted discipline inspections for two consecutive days before its transfer, holding separate meetings with landlords to solicit their opinions on the troops. The Ganzhou garrison in Jiangxi organized stilt yangko teams to extend New Year greetings to the masses door-to-door. A certain unit with combat missions proposed the slogan "Help the masses with one thing every day" during training breaks, helping residents gather firewood, dig sweet potatoes, and dig air-raid shelters. After repairing the Shuikou Dam, a unit directly under a certain army carried out a dike construction project in Shuikou Township. Under the slogan "Build the dike well to implement support for the government and cherishing the people," commanders and fighters rushed to build the dike in the midst of wind and rain. After the completion of this dam, 1,200 mu of farmland would be spared from flooding. Before the Spring Festival, troops stationed on the Leizhou Peninsula universally helped the masses clean up their homes, and vacated the houses needed by landlords during the Spring Festival period. A certain regiment discovered that local people avoided wearing straw sandals from the first to the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year, so the entire regiment changed to wearing cloth shoes. After returning from training every day, soldiers from a certain unit would discuss how to carry out work to love the people without resting. Soldiers from a certain company, because they had no time to help the masses during the day, would spare time at night during breaks to help their landlords carry water; the roof of a certain squad's landlord's room was leaking due to heavy rain, and all the soldiers in the squad took out rain cloths to cover the leak for the landlord; on Lunar New Year's Eve, soldiers from many units pooled their allowances together to give the landlord's children "lucky money," treating the soldiers and landlords as family; when a certain squad was about to move out of the people's houses they had been living in, the landlord stopped them, saying, "Is there something I did to let you down? If you want to move, you are looking down on us!" One letter from the people to the soldiers during the New Year said: "We've seen all kinds of armies, but none can compare to the PLA; you go fight on Hainan Island, and we will follow behind; support the front line and help the army, for the sake of the people being liberated!" The boatmen of the Leizhou Peninsula were very moved to see the soldiers saving their grain to help their impoverished boatmen's families celebrate the New Year, and actively and voluntarily participated in the army's work, teaching the soldiers the basics of navigation. Troops stationed in Xintang, Guangdong, in order to respect the people's New Year customs, asked them if they had any taboos, and the villagers said: "As long as the comrades are happy and free, that's all that matters, there are no taboos."

	Northwest Unit: Go to the Countryside to Treat Illnesses for Free, Donate Money to Help Orphans and Widows
	During the Spring Festival, the clinic of a certain unit stationed in Ningxia under the Northwest Military Region organized a work team to support the government and cherish the people, going to the countryside to treat farmers for free. The only daughter of a lonely old woman in Zhongxing Lane in Yinchuan died on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. The family had no money and no one to help, and they didn't even have a coffin. The troops stationed in Zhongxing Lane learned of this and immediately sent people to offer condolences, and initiated a fundraising campaign to buy a coffin. Thirteen soldiers carried the coffin to the suburbs for burial. The neighbors said in surprise: "Who has ever seen an army willing to help poor people carry a coffin!"
