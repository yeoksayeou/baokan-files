　　Xinhua News Agency, Alma-Ata Telegram: Among the outstanding people's representatives in Kazakhstan, the most admired are the women representatives, who have demonstrated their talents in labor.

　　The renowned Kazakh oil worker Dosbayeva was nominated by the Guryev election conference as a candidate for representative to the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Twenty years ago, she came to the Imba oilfield from a remote village on the coast of the Caspian Sea. She studied at night school and learned to be a co-driver. During the war, Dosbayeva called on the women of the area to take on the work left by the men who went to the front, and she herself began to lead the women's work group in the Bozhunas oilfield. This group is one of the best performing work groups in the Imba oilfield. Last year, Dosbayeva and her colleagues had already completed the five-year plan for oil production. Dosbayeva, who was originally an illiterate village girl, is now a politician. She was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1946 and has maintained close contact with her constituents. She often receives letters from workers in the Imba oilfield, fishermen on the Caspian Sea, people in the Urals, and livestock breeders.

　　Farmers of the "Happy Labor" collective farm in Pavlodar Oblast once again nominated the farm's chairman, Gitko, as a candidate for representative to the supreme organ of Soviet power. Gitko rose from being an ordinary collective farm woman to becoming the chairman of the collective farm and a politician. As the leader of the collective farm, Gitko successfully and rapidly developed the collective farming system. In four years, the area under cultivation more than doubled. Yields have also increased significantly, and the number of publicly owned livestock has tripled. New houses and clubs have also been built in the village.

　　Kurmaskova, an honored primary school teacher of the Kazakh Republic, has won the sincere love of the people. She has dedicated all her energy to nurturing the younger generation. Because of her selfless work, she was awarded the Order of Lenin. She has been nominated by voters in the Akmolinsk region as a candidate for representative to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

　　苏联最高苏维埃妇女候选人介绍
    【新华社讯】塔斯社阿拉木图电：在哈萨克斯坦优秀的人民代表候选人中最受推崇的是妇女代表，她们曾在劳动中表现出她们的才能。
    驰名的哈萨克石油女工多斯巴耶娃被古尔耶夫的选举大会提名为苏联最高苏维埃民族院代表候选人。二十年前，她从遥远的里海海滨的乡村来到伊姆巴油田。她在夜校学习并学会担任副司机的职务。在战争时期，多斯巴耶娃号召该地妇女负起出征到前线的男子留下工作，而她自己则开始领导伯朱那斯油田妇女工作组。该组是伊姆巴油田中成绩最佳的工作组之一。去年，多斯巴耶娃与她的同伴已经在石油生产上完成了五年计划。多斯巴耶娃本来是个不识字的村姑，现在已经是个政治家了。她在一九四六年被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，一直与她的选民保持着密切的联系。她时常收到来自伊姆巴油田工人、里海渔夫、乌拉尔人及牲畜饲养者的来信。
    巴夫洛达州“欢乐的劳动”集体农场农民，再度提名农场主席吉特科为苏联最高权力机关的代表候选人。吉特科是从一个普通的集体农妇而成为集体农场主席及政治家的。作为集体农场的领导者，吉特科成功地迅速发展了集体耕作制。在四年之内，作物种植地区增加了一倍以上。收获量也显著地增加了，公有的牲畜头数增加了两倍。乡村内而且建筑了新的房屋及俱乐部。
    哈萨克共和国功勋小学教师库尔马斯克娃赢得了人民真挚的敬爱。她以全部的精神致力于培养年青一代的工作。由于她忘我的工作，她曾荣获列宁勋章。她已被阿克摩林斯克区选民提名为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。
