　　Accelerate Commodity Sales Work
    Northeast Daily Editorial, February 28th
    The work inspection of the commercial sector in January indicated that although many departments (such as the Grain Company, Native Produce Company, and Fuel Company) completed or exceeded their planned sales targets, the failure of two major departments—cotton yarn and cloth and department stores—to meet their targets on schedule resulted in the failure to realize the state's cash recovery plan for that month, seriously affecting the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure plan. This fact should be taken seriously by our commercial sector workers, who should immediately examine the shortcomings in their work and promptly seek improvements.
    As everyone knows, in our New Democratic country's economy, various departments are closely related under a unified plan. Whether or not a department completes the tasks assigned to it by the state on schedule is not just a matter for that department, but also directly affects many other departments, and ultimately affects the success or failure of the entire national economic plan. Therefore, the state's plan should be observed by every person and every department like a law; it can only be exceeded, and not allowed to be unfulfilled. Commerce is the link between agriculture and industry. The New Democratic state commerce, on the one hand, must supply the broad masses of people with means of livelihood and means of production, regulate surpluses and shortages, and stabilize the market. On the other hand, it is responsible for promoting the sales of state industrial products and purchasing raw materials. Moreover, it must use its own strong material strength and strict policy stance to lead private commerce in a direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the quality of the commercial sector's work not only directly affects the lives and production of the broad masses of people, affects the country's economic construction, affects the state's control of the market and leadership of private commerce, but also affects the realization of the state's fiscal plan. We must recognize the importance of commercial work from a political height in order to stimulate vigorous work enthusiasm to overcome difficulties and complete the planned tasks.
    The quality of commercial work is primarily reflected in the amount of sales under the implementation of the state's price policy. The failure to complete the planned sales target in January means that the commercial work was not done well this month. What is the reason? On the one hand, the sales plan for the first quarter of this year is larger than that of the fourth quarter of last year. However, the leadership failed to foresee well some of the new problems and difficulties that would be caused by the expansion of the sales plan, and to plan and arrange for them in a timely manner, such as neglecting timely and in-depth supervision, inspection, and concrete problem-solving of the work below; there was no detailed plan and organization for the source and allocation of goods, resulting in the phenomenon of insufficient supply and insufficient or untimely allocation in some places. However, this is not the most important reason. Judging from the cotton yarn and cloth and department store sectors that failed to complete their tasks, the sales volume in January was only slightly more than 50% of the original inventory at the beginning of January. This shows that the main problem lies in the fact that some of our commercial sector comrades have not been able to maximize their enthusiasm and initiative, think of more ways to sell goods, and resolutely fight to complete the state's sales plan.
    In order to change this situation, first of all, all comrades in the commercial system should establish the concept of resolutely completing the state plan in their minds, and realize that the work of every individual and every unit in our economic sector is an organic part of the state's entire economic structure. The failure of anyone's task will affect the state's entire economic plan, which will ultimately cause great losses to the state. Of course, completing the plan will be difficult, which requires us to exert subjective efforts to overcome difficulties from all aspects, instead of emphasizing difficulties and being helpless in the face of difficulties. We should always meet new tasks with high enthusiasm, and not slacken our efforts when new tasks arrive because of past achievements.
    Secondly, we must overcome the various conservative ideas that exist in commercial work, the most common of which is the fear that if the goods are sold out, new goods will not arrive and there will be nothing to sell. This idea comes from narrow experience. In the past, under the wartime environment, our liberated areas were divided and blockaded by the enemy, and transportation was inconvenient. At that time, material difficulties and shortages were a common and inevitable phenomenon. But now it is fundamentally different. Except for Tibet, the entire Chinese mainland has been liberated, transportation has been restored rapidly, and the exchange of goods between various parts of the country is becoming increasingly smooth. In addition, foreign trade is also being actively developed. Although the demand for supply is increasing, the source of materials is also expanding day by day. Another concern is the fear of rising prices, and that selling more will cause the state to suffer losses. This also comes from past experience. Although prices cannot be absolutely prevented from rising now because the war has not yet finally ended, it must be recognized that an important task of our state-owned commerce is to stabilize prices. Stable prices will stabilize people's lives and benefit the country's economic construction. To stabilize prices, we must sell goods in large quantities. Under the state's overall plan, the more we sell, the more we can control the market, and the more beneficial it will be to the country. However, hoarding goods and not selling them not only ties up funds and hinders the expansion of reproduction, but also hinders the supply of the masses' needs and affects people's lives.
    Third, we must overcome the blindness in commercial work, conduct thorough investigation and research, and advocate thinking of more ways. We must neither rely solely on past experience and look at the present with past eyes, nor can we act solely on estimates and imagination. What goods do the local people need most? What colors or styles of these goods are most popular and welcomed by the masses? How much purchasing power do the local people have? How much can we solve with our strength? When are certain goods most easily sold? If allocation is not timely, what remedial measures can be taken to solve the problem? Are there any shortcomings in our organizational work? Are our business methods suitable for the requirements and habits of the masses? Is it absolutely impossible to sell the so-called "cold inventory goods"? Or are we not working hard enough and our methods are not good enough? All of these require all commercial work comrades to exert their sense of responsibility and initiative to actively understand and find ways to solve them. For example, some places can solve the source of goods, such as plows, shares and other agricultural implements needed by farmers, which can be solved and adjusted by the provincial companies themselves, and do not need to be solved by the state as a whole. As another example, experience has proven that in addition to selling in large quantities through urban and rural cooperatives as much as possible, in towns and cities where cooperatives are not very developed and their strength is not great, more retail stores of state-owned stores can be established, and goods will be sold faster; because state-owned stores rely on cooperatives and these small retail stores to form a sales network of state-owned stores, delivering goods directly to every corner, which is of great convenience to the masses. Therefore, we should actively help the development of cooperatives and the opening of small retail stores and stalls; in rural areas where the strength of cooperatives is insufficient or small, in addition to making full use of supply and marketing cooperatives, we can also temporarily adopt the method of pulling goods down to the countryside with horse-drawn carts. And study related issues such as the delivery system and inspection system, and summarize and promote these experiences. In order to overcome the blindness in work, companies at all levels should formulate accurate plans for the source of goods, transportation, distribution and sales, etc., based on the actual needs understood through investigation, and implement them conscientiously.
    Fourth, we must strengthen contact and combination with all parties. The commercial sector should take the initiative to seek guidance from local Party and government organs on commercial work; local Party and government organs also have the responsibility to check the supply and sales plans of the commercial sector, help it overcome difficulties, and urge and ensure its completion. Party and government organs in various places must understand that the Party and government leading organs in a place where the sales plan has not been completed must also bear certain responsibilities. Specialized companies, companies and stores, stores and stores, and the commercial system and cooperatives should strengthen business contacts and cooperation. The best way to consolidate this relationship is to sign contracts. In particular, signing supply and sales contracts with cooperatives is a good way to communicate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. It not only actually supports the operation of cooperatives, but also enables state-owned goods to directly reach consumers through cooperatives, greatly speeding up the sales and expanding the scope of sales, and making the operation planned. For example, because the Liaozhong and Panshi County Department Stores signed contracts well, many goods were directly loaded onto carts from the railway station and allocated to various cooperatives without even passing through the stores. This will undoubtedly greatly increase the speed of commodity circulation.
    Now, February has passed, and commercial system comrades in various places should seize the market demand of the broad masses of farmers before the spring plowing, and immediately mobilize sufficient forces to step up sales. Those who did not complete the tasks in January have already made up for them in February, and those who have not been able to make up for them in February must complete them in March (that is, within this quarter). Of course, in the sales process, we must strictly abide by and implement the state's planned price policy, and strive to sell directly to consumers through state-owned stores and cooperatives, to prevent violations of policies for the sake of completing tasks or not understanding that the purpose of sales is to recover currency, stabilize prices, accelerate capital turnover, thereby increasing national wealth and promoting the development of production, and the phenomenon of blindly selling for the sake of sales. Only in this way can we ensure that the economic construction of Northeast China this year proceeds step by step, and ensure that the state's fiscal plan is fully realized.

　　加速商品推销工作
    东北日报二月二十八日社论
    商业部门一月份的工作检查指明：虽然许多部门（如粮食公司、土产公司、燃料公司等）完成或者超过了预定的推销计划，但因为两个主要部门——花纱布与百货公司，未能按期完成任务，致使该月国家现金回笼计划未能实现，严重地影响了国家财政收支计划。这一事实应引起我们商业部门工作人员的重视，即刻检查自己工作中的缺陷，并应迅谋改进。
    大家知道，我们新民主主义国家经济，各部门之间在统一计划下密切相关，这一部门是否按期完成了国家所课予的任务，不仅仅是这一部门的事，而且直接影响及于其他许多部门，最后便关系整个国家经济计划的成败。所以，国家的计划对于每一个人、每一部门，都应当像法规一样地被遵守，只能超过，不许不完成。商业是农业与工业联系的纽带，新民主主义的国家商业，一方面要供应广大人民群众以生活资料及生产资料，调剂有无，稳定市场，一方面又负着为国家工业推销产品及收购原料的任务；而且它又要以其本身的雄厚物资力量及严格的政策立场，来领导私营商业向着有利于国计民生的方向前进。因此，商业部门工作的好坏，不仅直接影响到广大人民的生活及生产，影响到国家的经济建设，影响到国家对于市场的掌握与对私营商业的领导，而且影响到国家财政计划的实现。我们必须从政治高度上来认识商业工作的重要性，才能激发蓬勃的工作热情，来冲破困难完成预定的任务。
    商业工作的好坏，首先是具体的表现于在贯彻国家的价格政策下推销额的多寡。一月份的推销额没有完成预定计划，就是说这月商业工作没作好。其原因何在？一方面由于本年第一季度的推销计划，较去年第四季度为大。但领导上未能很好地预见到由于推销计划扩大所将引起的一些新问题，新困难，而及时为之筹划布置，比如忽略了对下面工作的及时深入督促检查与具体的解决问题；对商品的来源与调拨，没有详尽的计划与组织工作，致使有些地方发生了商品不继与调拨不足或不及时的现象。然而，这还不是最主要的原因。试就未完成任务的花纱布与百货部门来看，一月份的推销额，仅及一月初原库存额的百分之五十多一点，由此可见，主要的问题在于：我们商业部门的若干工作同志，尚未能发挥最大的积极性与能动性，多想办法去推销货物，坚决为完成国家的推销计划而斗争。
    为了改变这种情况，首先，所有商业系统工作同志的思想上，应树立起坚决完成国家计划的观念，认识到我们经济部门的每一个人，每一单位的工作，都是国家整个经济机构的有机的一部分，任何人的任务没有完成，都会影响国家整个经济计划，而归结起来便会造成国家的莫大损失。当然，完成计划是会有困难的，这就要求我们去发挥主观的努力，从各方面克服困难，而不应是强调困难，在困难面前束手。时时刻刻以高度的热情迎接新的任务，不可因为过去的成绩自满，而在新的任务到来时松了劲。
    其次，便要克服现存在于商业工作中的各种各样的保守思想，其中最普遍的一种就是怕货卖光了新的到不了，会没有得卖。这种思想是由于狭隘的经验而来的。过去处在战争环境的情况下，我们解放区被敌人分割封锁，交通不便，那时物资困难，缺货乃是一种经常现象与必然现象。但是现在根本不同了，中国大陆除西藏外已经全告解放，交通恢复迅速，国内各地物资交流日益畅通，加以对外贸易亦在积极开展之中，虽然对于供应的要求越益提高，但物资的来源也在日益扩大。还有一种是怕物价涨，多卖会使国家吃亏。这也是由过去经验来的。现在虽然因为战争尚未最后结束，物价尚不能绝对不涨，然而要认识我们国营商业的一项重要任务，就是稳定物价，物价稳定，才能使人民生活安定而有利于国家经济建设。想稳定物价便须大量推销货物，在国家总的计划之下，越卖得多，便越能掌握市场，越对国家有利；而把货压着不卖，既积压了资金，妨碍了扩大再生产，又妨碍了供应群众需要，影响了人民生活。
    第三，要克服商业工作中的盲目性，切实进行调查研究，提倡多想办法。既不可单凭过去的经验，拿过去的眼光去看现在，也不可以仅凭估计与想像办事。究竟当地人民最需要什么货物？这类货物又以什么花色或样式最为群众喜爱与欢迎？当地人民购买力究竟有多大？以我们的力量能够解决其多少？什么货物在什么时候最易于销售？如果调拨不及还可以想什么补救办法解决？我们的组织工作有什么缺点吗？我们的营业方法适合群众的要求与习惯吗？所谓库存冷货是否绝对无法脱售？还是我们努力不够，方法不善？所有这些，都需要全体商业工作同志发挥责任心与积极性，主动地去了解与设法解决。譬如有些地方上能解决的商品来源，如农民需用的犁、铧等农具，即可由各省公司自己解决调剂，而不需要由国家来统筹解决。又如经验证明：除尽量通过城乡合作社大量推销外，在合作社还不很发展，力量还不大的城镇中，还可多建立国家商店的零售店，货就销得更快；因为国家商店依靠合作社与这些小型的零售店，构成了国家商店的推销网，把货物直送到各个角落，对群众有很大的便利。因此，我们便应该积极帮助合作社的发展与开设小型零售店、零售床子；在合作社力量达不到或力量还小的农村，除尽量运用供销合作社外，还可暂时采用套大车拉货下乡的办法。并研究有关的送货制、检查制等等问题，把这些经验加以总结、推广。为克服工作中的盲目性，各级公司都应该根据调查所了解的实际需要，按期制订出准确的商品来源、运输、分拨与销售计划等，切实执行。
    第四，要加强与各方面的联系及结合。商业部门要主动的求得地方党政机关对商业工作的指导；地方党政机关亦有责任检查商业部门的供销计划，帮助其克服困难，并督促保证其完成。各地党政机关必须了解：那一个地方的推销计划没有完成，那一个地方的党政领导机关也要负担一定的责任。各专营公司之间、公司与商店之间、商店与商店之间、商业系统与合作社之间，都应该加强业务上联系与配合，而巩固这种联系的最好方法，就是订立合同。特别是和合作社订立供销合同，这是沟通城乡物资交流的好途径。不仅实际上扶助了合作社的经营，而且通过合作社使国家商品直接到达消费者手中，大大地加速了推销速度与扩大推销范围，并使经营有了计划性。如辽中及磐石县百货公司因为合同订得好，许多货物甚至不经商店，从火车站就直接装大车拨到各合作社，这样无疑能使商品流转的速度大为提高。
    现在，二月份已经度过，各地商业系统工作同志，应该抓紧春耕以前广大农民对市场的要求，迅即动员充足力量，加紧推销。凡一月份未完成任务的，于二月份已在补足，二月份尚未能补足的，务须于三月内（亦即本季度内）加油完成。自然，在推销中必须严格遵守与贯彻国家计划的价格政策，并力求通过国营商店与合作社直接推销到消费者手中，防止为完成任务而违反政策或不了解推销目的在于回笼货币，稳定物价，加速资金周转从而增加国家财富以促进生产之发展，而盲目的为推销而推销的现象。只有这样，我们才能保证今年东北的经济建设按步进行，保证国家的财政计划充分实现。
