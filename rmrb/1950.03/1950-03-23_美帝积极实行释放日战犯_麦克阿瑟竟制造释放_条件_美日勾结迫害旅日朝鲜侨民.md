Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: MacArthur is actively implementing the heinous measure of releasing all Japanese war criminals in batches. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch, citing a statement made on the 18th by Hagen, chairman of the so-called "Oath Release Committee," MacArthur Headquarters' legal team had already received hundreds of applications for "leniency" from friends and relatives of Japanese war criminals even before the "Committee" was established. Hagen's statement confirms the news, already revealed by United Press on the 7th, that "several hundred war criminals can now or within months be released after taking an oath." MacArthur Headquarters announced on the 18th three so-called "conditions for release by oath." These conditions are: "Trial records and all materials related to the case," "Reports from the prison on the prisoner's behavior, attitude, and work record," and the war criminal's "age, physical strength, and mental condition." It is foreseeable that MacArthur will use compliance with these "conditions" as a reason to declare any Japanese war criminal a "model prisoner" and of "good behavior" and release them.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch: According to a Tokyo dispatch from Dentsu, on the morning of the 20th, the Yoshida government dispatched a large number of police officers in an attempt to "take over" a house inhabited by 33 Korean resident families and evict them. To protect their families, the Korean residents resisted the illegal actions of the Japanese police, who then resorted to violence and summoned 2,000 additional special police to attack the Korean residents who were defending their homes. According to Reuters, 130 Korean residents were arrested, 200 were injured, and more than ten were seriously injured due to being cruelly trampled by the police.

This atrocity was carried out with the direct participation of the U.S. occupation authorities. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 20th, about 30 U.S. police and officers were "mingled together" with Japanese police around the location where the "conflict" occurred. Another twelve U.S. occupation officers stood by at the Kuramae police station, where the Korean residents were being detained, to cheer them on, fearing that the Korean residents would come to rescue the arrested.

　　美帝积极实行释放日战犯  麦克阿瑟竟制造释放“条件”
    美日勾结迫害旅日朝鲜侨民
    【新华社二十一日讯】麦克阿瑟正积极实行分批释放全部日本战犯的罪恶措施。据合众社东京电引所谓“宣誓释放委员会”主席哈根十八日的谈话透露：麦克阿瑟总部法律组在“委员会”尚未成立以前，即已接获自日本战犯的朋友及亲属方面送来的数百件请求“宽恕”的申请书。哈根这一谈话证实合众社七日即已透露的“有好几百个战犯现在或者数月内可于宣誓后释放”的消息。麦克阿瑟总部于十八日宣布了所谓“宣誓释放”的三个“条件”。这些条件是：“审判纪录及一切对本案有关的材料”，“监狱对犯人行为、态度及工作纪录的报告”，及战犯的“年龄、体力及精神条件”。可以预料，麦克阿瑟将以合乎这些“条件”为理由，宣布任何日本战犯为“模范犯人”、“行为良好”而加以释放。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据电通社东京讯：二十日晨，吉田政府派遣大队警察企图“接收”一所住着三十三家朝鲜侨民的房屋，并把他们驱逐出去。朝鲜侨民为保护自己的家庭，对日本警察的非法行为加以抗拒，日警竟施用暴力，并召来增援的特别警察二千人，向保卫自己家庭的朝鲜侨民攻击。据路透社称：结果朝鲜侨民有一百三十人被捕，二百人受伤，有十余人因遭警察残酷的践踏而受重伤。
    这一暴行是在美国占领军当局直接参预下进行的，据路透社东京二十日电称：约有三十名美国警察和警官在发生“冲突”的地点周围，与日本警察“混合在一起”；另有十二名美国占领军官站在拘押朝鲜侨民的藏米警察署助威，因为他们惟恐朝鲜侨民前来营救被捕者。
