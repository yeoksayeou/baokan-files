Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th. To strengthen ethnic unity, the People's Governments of some counties and cities in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces have successively established Ethnic Affairs Committees or Ethnic Affairs Offices. When Lintan County, Gansu, convened a preparatory meeting for the Ethnic Affairs Committee on the 6th of last month, it decided that the initial work of the committee would be: 1. To enhance the connection between various ethnic groups and further establish a close relationship with the People's Government; 2. To extensively absorb youths from various ethnic groups to participate in government work at all levels; 3. To promptly convey the policies and decrees of the People's Government to the broad masses of all ethnic groups, and to reflect the opinions and living conditions of the people of all ethnic groups to the People's Government; 4. To mediate disputes between people of all ethnic groups based on the principle of equality and unity. The Huining County Ethnic Affairs Committee was officially established on the 2nd of last month. The Pingliang County Ethnic Affairs Committee has established two spare-time literacy classes for the masses, with a total of seventy-four Hui people participating in the study. The Ethnic Affairs Office of the Dihua City People's Government, Xinjiang, convened a forum for people from all ethnic groups on the 27th of last month. Representatives from various circles of the Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, Han, and Uzbek ethnic groups, heads of various cultural associations, and imams, totaling thirty-two people, attended the meeting. At the meeting, all representatives unanimously accused the Kuomintang of reactionary rule and expressed their resolute support for the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. A representative of the Uyghur handicraft workers poured out the oppression and exploitation suffered by the workers during the past reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and said: Today we can speak our minds as masters of our own affairs, which is entirely the result of Chairman Mao, the leader of the people of all ethnic groups, leading us to defeat the reactionaries. Our worker brothers of all ethnic groups should unite and work hard in production. Three women representatives, Chaililan of the Kazakh ethnicity, Zhang He of the Hui ethnicity, and Zhuang Yueqin of the Han ethnicity, unanimously proposed that the Municipal People's Government should conduct in-depth propaganda and education in the future to encourage women of all ethnic groups to participate in social activities.
