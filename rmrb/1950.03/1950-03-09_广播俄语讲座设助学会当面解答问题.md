　　[This Newspaper] The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, which jointly organize the radio Russian language lectures, have consulted with 34 students from the Russian Language Learning Group of the Normal University to form a radio Russian language lecture tutoring group in order to answer questions from listeners learning Russian in person. The group, in pairs, will begin next week to provide tutoring services externally or go to collective study units with five or more registered people to provide assistance; or they will select locations where listeners learning Russian are concentrated and answer questions for collective study units with fewer than five registered people and individual learners at a specific time. Those requesting assistance should submit their requests to the Editorial Department of Beijing People's Broadcasting Station in advance by phone or letter, stating the unit name, registration number, detailed address, phone number, and the name of the person in charge. As for collective study units or individual learners who have not yet registered, they can go to the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at No. 2 Yuhe Bridge, Dongjiaomin Lane, from March 9th to 18th to complete the registration.
