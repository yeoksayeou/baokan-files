Village Cadres Steal Relief Grain
Fu Mingyi and Others Dismissed and Will Be Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to a notice from the Tianjin Prefecture: In Futiazi Village, Fourth District, Ninghe County, an incident occurred during the distribution of relief grain where village cadres stole relief grain, seriously harming the interests of disaster victims and undermining the government's prestige. In late December of last year, after the relief grain was distributed to the village, no attention was paid to inspection and safekeeping. The village cadres Fu Mingyi (village relief assistant), Ma Zhankui (education committee member), Fu Zunrong (village deputy), Fu Shenfa (production committee member), and Fu Linrong (village duty officer) and other five people, took the opportunity to steal 217 catties of grain the night before the distribution, and mixed in an equal weight of black sand to make up the weight. After the grain was distributed, the masses were in an uproar and expressed their dissatisfaction. After hearing this feedback, the county work team and the district civil affairs assistant went to the village to inspect and saw that the grain received by each household was one-third soil. Fu Dezhao received 25 catties of grain, of which 8 catties were soil; Fu Xueqin received 41 catties of grain, of which 12 catties were soil. From the 850 catties of grain received by 19 households, 112 catties of soil were sifted out. Later, 105 catties of soil were sifted out from the 1,150 catties remaining in the grain store (a total of 217 catties of soil mixed in). After clarifying and verifying the situation, the work team questioned the village cadres, who were unable to answer. A mass meeting was immediately convened to explain the process of the village cadres stealing grain and mixing in soil, and 200 catties of stolen red grain were recovered and returned to the disaster-stricken households on the spot. The People's Government also immediately announced the dismissal of Fu Zunrong and other four people, and handed over the principal offenders Fu Mingyi, Ma Zhankui, and Fu Zunrong to the government for prosecution.

　　天津专署宁河县傅台子村
    村干部偷盗救济粮
    傅明义等被撤职将予法办
    【本报讯】据天津专署通报：宁河县四区傅台子村，发放救济粮时，发生村干部偷盗救济粮，严重损害灾民利益及破坏政府威信事件。去年十二月下旬，赈粮分发到村后，未加注意检查保管，该村村干部傅明义（村帮赈）、马占奎（教育委员）、傅尊荣（村副）、傅慎发（生产委员）、傅林荣（村值班员）等五人，于发放前一天夜里，趁机偷盗粮食二百十七斤，并以同等重量之黑沙土掺入补称。待粮食发下后，群众大哗，纷纷表示不满。县工作组和区民政助理听此反映后，即到该村检查，看到各户所领的粮食土占三分之一，傅得照领粮二十五斤内有土八斤，傅学琴领粮四十一斤内有土十二斤。从十九户的领粮八百五十斤内筛出土一百一十二斤。后从粮库存的一千一百五十斤内，又筛出土一百零五斤（共计掺土二百一十七斤）。工作组把情况弄清证实后质问村干部，村干无言答对，当即召开了群众大会，说明村干偷粮掺土的经过，追回所偷红粮二百斤，当场发还了被赈户。人民政府并随即宣布将傅尊荣等四人撤职，并把主犯傅明义、马占奎、傅尊荣送交政府法办。
