　　Singing the China Changchun Railway
    Shao Yanxiang
    Manchuria, what a fertile land,
    The China Changchun Railway crisscrosses the sea of land!
    In January, the spring breeze blows all over Manchuria,
    In February, the river opens and the wild geese return.
    Endless telegraph wires, endless railways,
    The China Changchun Railway trains run day and night—
    From Manchuria in the west to Suifenhe in the east,
    —Facing the sun southwards to Dalian and Lushunkou.
    The water of Hailar River flows with a hissing sound,
    Cattle and sheep are put on the grassland.
    Eastbound and westbound trains all head to Manchuria,
    Manchuria is where the China-Soviet railway connects!
    The water of Suifenhe River flows with a gurgling sound,
    Lasso poles drive horses, sliding along the avenue.
    Westbound and eastbound trains all head to Suifenhe,
    Suifenhe is close to the Soviet Union—a fraternal country.
　  All thanks to the gust of wind in August 1945,
    The Soviet Red Army sent troops to aid the Chinese people,
    Liberated Manchuria and Suifenhe,
    Liberated the China Changchun Railway and the Great Northeast.
　  All thanks to our leader Mao Zedong,
    He commanded the heroic democratic allied forces,
    Under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits looting, preserved the China Changchun Railway and then liberated the entire Northeast,
    The snow melted on Changbai Mountain, and the Heilongjiang River thawed.
　  Now, Suifenhe is adjacent to the coastal province,
    The vast grassland connects to Siberia.
    The boundless wilderness is blown by the sea breeze,
    China and the Soviet Union share a sky.
    The China Changchun Railway and the Siberian Railway,
    Two rails tightly hold hands,
    Trains freely come and go on the railway,
    Passing people also walk freely…
    The China Changchun Railway and the Ussuri Railway,
    Connect at Suifenhe, this gateway,
    A railway straight as a hair,
    Even in the dark, you can find your way…
    Trains from the west stop in Manchuria,
    One railcar biting another,
    Unloading box after box to see—
    Mining equipment, steel rails, various machines…
    Train after train departs from Manchuria,
    Following the Hailar River, heading southeast,
    Passing through mountains and crossing rivers,
    Dense layers of chimneys and factories!
    Train after train departs from Suifenhe,
    Rushing down to the southwest,
    Inside and outside the pass are waiting for the treasures in your cars,
    Along the way, tens of millions cheer like thunder!
    China and the Soviet Union are good friends,
    China and the Soviet Union are good brothers,
    The two countries signed an agreement, and the Soviet Union will return the China Changchun Railway,
    The alliance of 700 million people, who dares to bully!
    The shoulder of the Soviet Union is close to Manchuria,
    Manchuria is the shoulder of our motherland,
    You look around the China Changchun Railway:
    The beautiful rivers and mountains are a beautiful sight!
                                      (February 1950)

　　歌唱中国长春铁路
    邵燕祥
    满洲呵，好一片丰饶的大地，
    中长路纵横过大地的海！
    一月里春风吹遍满洲，
    二月里河开雁又来。
    望不断的电线，望不断的铁道，
    中长路的火车日夜奔走——
    西起满洲里，东到绥芬河，
    ——顶着太阳往南是大连、旅顺口。
    海拉尔的流水嘶啦啦地响，
    牛呵羊呵放在草原上。
    东来西来的火车都奔满洲里，
    满洲里是中苏铁路接轨的地方！
    绥芬河的流水呼溜溜地响，
    套马杆子赶马滑过大道旁。
    西来东来的火车都奔绥芬河，
    绥芬河紧靠着苏联——兄弟之邦。
　  这都亏四五年八月一阵风，
    苏联红军出兵援助中国人民，
    解放了满洲里、绥芬河，
    解放了中长路和大关东。
　  这都亏咱们领袖毛泽东，
    他指挥英勇的民主联军，
    在蒋匪略夺下保住了中长路再解放全东北，
    长白山化了雪，黑龙江开了冻。
　  如今呵，绥芬河贴着沿海省，
    辽阔的草原接着西伯利亚。
    没边的旷野上吹着大海风，
    中苏两国头顶着一片天空。
    中长路和西伯利亚铁路，
    两条铁轨紧紧拉住手，
    火车在铁道上自由地来去，
    过往的人们也自由行走……
    中长路和那乌苏里铁路，
    相接在绥芬河这个门户，
    一条铁道直如发呵，
    夜黑里摸着也走熟……
    打西来的火车停在满洲里，
    一节车皮咬着一节车皮，
    一箱一箱地卸了下来看呵——
    采矿设备、钢轨、各种机器……
    一节节的火车从满洲里开出，
    沿着海拉尔河就往东南走，
    穿过山岭越过江，
    密密层层的烟囱和工厂！
    一节节的火车打绥芬河开，
    哗啦啦朝西南跑了下来，
    关里关外都等你车里的宝贝，
    沿路上千万人欢声如雷！
    中苏是一对好朋友，
    中苏是一对好弟兄，
    两国签约，苏联将归还中国长春铁路，
    七万万人民大同盟，哪一个敢欺侮！
    苏联的肩膀紧靠着满洲，
    满洲是我们祖国的肩膀，
    你沿着中长路望那四方呵：
    锦绣的山河好风光！
                                      （一九五○年二月）
