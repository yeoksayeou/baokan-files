Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The State Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions regarding the 1950 Spring Water Conservancy Projects. The full text is as follows:

　　In 1949, the flood-affected area reached approximately 100 million mu, greatly impacting the recovery and development of our rural economy. These disasters were mainly due to the breaches and overflows of river embankments. Although efforts were made last autumn and winter to rescue and restore them, and most areas are now able to carry out spring plowing, the natural factors that caused the floods still exist. On the other hand, the water conservancy of vast farmlands needs to be restored and developed. Therefore, this year's water conservancy construction policy still prioritizes flood control, drainage, and irrigation. The engineering goals are: to ensure that major rivers nationwide, such as the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Huai River, do not experience breaches even if they encounter the same floods as in 1949, except for a few rivers with narrow channels that simply cannot handle the floodwaters of 1949 and can only be required to withstand ordinary floods without breaches; and to restore and develop 5.56 million mu of paddy fields, and strive to irrigate 2.37 million mu this year. These are all important conditions for ensuring agricultural production this year. To complete this task, the earthwork alone amounts to over 210 million cubic meters. Apart from the 24 million cubic meters already completed last winter, there are still 186 million cubic meters that urgently need to be completed through future efforts. Spring has now arrived, and these projects will successively enter a large-scale construction phase. All dike repair and dredging projects must be completed before the major flood season this year (end of June in the north, mid-May in the south). Due to the massive scale of the project and the tight timeframe, this year's spring repair project is indeed an extremely arduous task. Achieving a victorious completion of this task is the decisive key to our victory over floods in 1950. Therefore, the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government hereby issues the following instructions, urging all levels of people's government, all levels of water conservancy authorities, and other relevant authorities to earnestly implement them.

  Establish Joint Leadership Organizations, Closely Organize and Carefully Plan

    (1) Strengthen organizational leadership and preparatory work. The amount of earthwork this spring is very large, and with the addition of dams, sluices, and other projects, approximately 150 million workdays are required. Without the active participation and responsible leadership of local administrative organs, the completion of the spring repair task is inconceivable for such a large-scale mass project. Therefore, the administrative leading organs in the relevant areas must regard this as one of their central tasks. In addition to strengthening leadership by water conservancy authorities at all levels, strong joint leadership organizations must be established, such as spring work committees and spring work headquarters, to unify the mobilization and organization of the masses. This organization should include responsible cadres from local government organs, water conservancy authorities, and other relevant authorities to form a joint team. Secondly, the organization and planning of all aspects of affairs related to the project must be strengthened. All matters, such as the preparation of tools, the division of work sections, the allocation of cadres, the purchase and transportation of grain and fodder, the arrangement of food and lodging for laborers, the control of farming gaps, and the division of labor and mutual assistance between repair work and other production work, must be carefully planned and closely organized in advance. Resolutely avoid the guerrilla-style approach of starting construction rashly without sufficient preparation. In the winter repair project last year, some areas saw phenomena where food and lodging for the laborers on the dikes were not properly planned, causing great losses to the masses. There were also instances of arbitrarily changing the start time of construction, causing the masses to travel back and forth in vain. These should all be taken as lessons. As for projects for which preliminary plans have not yet been made, if they are not absolutely necessary and there is no certainty of completion, it is better to postpone them for a year to avoid suspension midway or perfunctory completion, which would fail to produce the desired results and would only waste manpower and resources. In some areas, a large number of military workers are participating in the spring repair project, and practical issues should be thoroughly discussed with the troops to ensure the smooth completion of the task.

  Administrative Cadres Should Cooperate with Technical Cadres, Strive to Improve Engineering Quality, and Disaster Areas Should Combine Disaster Relief with Work-for-Relief

    (2) Improve engineering quality and ensure economic benefits. All projects must be built solidly in accordance with engineering requirements and standards. Good soil should be selected, and layers should be compacted. Especially for river defense earthworks, which are large in quantity and widely distributed, coupled with a lack of cadres and insufficient experience, and the absence of ramming habits in individual areas, if the emphasis on improving engineering quality is not placed first, then a thousand-mile golden dike will be breached by a single hole, and one section being poorly done will render ten sections useless, which will inevitably lead to serious adverse consequences. Therefore, leading organs at all levels must emphasize the requirement to improve engineering quality and oppose the view of simply completing the quantity. Special attention must be paid to the inspection of projects where two districts and two sections are joined. In terms of improving engineering quality, administrative cadres and technical cadres must unite and cooperate fully. The engineering standards should be determined based on water conditions, economic and human resources, and other conditions, and should be carefully considered to ensure that the desired effectiveness is achieved. After the project is decided, political work, organizational work, and educational work among the masses must be carried out conscientiously to ensure the thorough realization of the engineering requirements. On the one hand, it is necessary to overcome the purely technical viewpoint of being divorced from the masses, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to overcome the one-sided mass viewpoint of neglecting engineering quality.

    (3) In the disaster areas, the project should be combined with disaster relief and work-for-relief should be earnestly implemented. If the labor of the masses in the disaster areas can be utilized well in the spring repair project, it can not only complete the spring repair task but also play a great role in helping the victims of the disaster to overcome the spring famine. Therefore, in the disaster areas, the project should be combined with disaster relief work as much as possible while ensuring the completion of the project. The opportunity to work should be given as a priority to any able-bodied person who can participate in the work among the disaster victims in each area. It is forbidden to refuse them on the excuse of being physically weak. In severely affected areas where there is a shortage of food, a portion of the wages can also be appropriated as food. On the other hand, it is necessary to firmly grasp the quality and progress of the originally planned project to ensure that it is completed on schedule in accordance with standards. If the project is not done well or is not completed, it may prolong the people's suffering.

    (4) In order to guarantee the successful completion of the task, the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government must grasp the overall leadership of the spring repair project and focus on major rivers such as the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Huai River. Responsible cadres should go to the above-mentioned areas to conduct thorough inspections and convene meetings to solve various practical problems. Responsible cadres of administrative organs in relevant areas must participate and actively cooperate in this work. As for the inspection and leadership of the spring repair work in their respective jurisdictions by local administrative organs and water conservancy authorities across the country, they should also follow this spirit and carry it out earnestly.

    Now that the spring thaw has begun, the projects in the north will be successively started. Although a part of the projects in the south were completed last winter, most of them are concentrated in this spring. Currently, every extra effort made will add a layer of protection for summer flood prevention and autumn harvest. All regions should be actively mobilized, seize the opportunity, and strive to complete the 1950 spring repair task!

　　中央人民政府政务院发布指示
    进行水利春修工程
    望各地抓紧时机，积极动员，保障今年夏防秋收。
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府政务院发布关于一九五○年水利春修工程的指示，全文如下：
    一九四九年水灾面积，约达一亿市亩，大大影响了我农村经济的恢复与发展。这些灾情主要系由于江河堤防的溃决和泛滥，虽经去年秋冬努力抢救与自然涸复，绝大部分地区已可进行春耕，但造成水灾的自然因素依然存在。而另一面又有广大农田的水利，需要加以恢复和开展。故今年水利建设的方针，仍以防洪、排水和灌溉为首要的任务。工程目标：除去少数河流河槽狭窄，根本不能承泄一九四九年的洪水，只能要求普通洪水不生溃决以外，全国主要河流如黄河、长江、淮河等，都要求保证再遇一九四九年同样的洪水也不生溃决；同时并恢复与开发水田五百五十六万亩，争取今年浇地二百三十七万亩。这都是保障今年农业生产的重要条件。完成这一任务，单只土方工程，即达二亿一千余万立方公尺，除去年冬季已经完成二千四百万立方公尺以外，尚有一亿八千六百万立方公尺，急需今后努力完成。现在春季已到，这些工程即相继进入大规模施工阶段，所有修堤疏浚工程，并须于今年大汛以前（北方六月底，南方五月中旬）全部完成。由于工程浩大与时间紧迫，今年的春修工程实在是一件极艰巨的任务。争取胜利地完成这一任务，是我们一九五○年战胜水灾的决定关键。因此，中央人民政府政务院特指示下列几点，望各级人民政府、各级水利机关及其他有关机关务须切实执行。
  建立联合领导机构  严密组织精心策划
    （一）加强组织领导与准备工作。今春土方工程数量甚大，再加坝埽涵闸等工程，约需一亿五千万工。这样大规模群众性的工程，如果没有地方行政机关的积极参加与负责领导，春修任务的完成是不能设想的，所以有关地区的行政领导机关，必须视为中心工作之一。除各级水利机关加强领导外，并须建立强有力的联合的领导机关，如春工委员会、春工指挥部等，以便统一动员组织群众。这一机构要包括地方政府机关、水利机关及其他有关机关的负责干部，共同组成。其次，必须加强与工程有关的各方面事务的组织性与计划性，举凡工具之准备，工段之划分，干部之配备，粮秣之购运，民工食宿之安排，农隙之掌握，以及修工与其他生产工作之分工互助等，均须事先精心策划，严密组织。坚决避免准备不足贸然施工的游击作风。去年冬修工程中，个别地区有民工上堤食宿尚未筹划妥当的现象，使群众受到很大损失，也有因任意改变开工时间，使群众徒劳往返的事实，均应引为鉴戒。至于迄今尚未做出初步计划的工程，如非绝对必需，且无完成把握，则宁可推迟一年举办，以免中途停顿或草率完工，不能发生应有的效果，徒然浪费人力物力。部分地区，大量军工参加春修工程，亦应与部队切实商讨，解决各种实际问题，以便顺利完成任务。
  行政干部应与技术干部合作  努力提高工程质量  灾区要结合救
        灾做到以工代赈
    （二）提高工程质量，保证经济效益。所有工程必须按照工程要求标准，修建坚实。选择好土，层土层夯。尤其是河防土工，数量大，分布广，加以干部缺乏，经验不够，个别地区没有行夯打硪的习惯，如果不把提高工程质量强调到第一位，则千里金堤，溃于一穴，一段不好，十段白修，必将发生重大的恶果。因此各级领导机关，必须强调提高工程质量的要求，反对单纯完成数量的观点。对于两区两段接合的工程，尤须注意检查。在提高工程质量的要求上，行政干部与技术干部必须结合一致，通力合作。规定工程标准，应当根据水情及经济人力等条件，切实考虑，求能发生应有的效能。工程决定以后，则须认真进行政治工作、组织工作及群众中的教育工作，保证工程要求的彻底实现。一方面要克服脱离群众的单纯技术观点，同时也要克服忽略工程质量的片面群众观点。
    （三）在灾区的工程，要结合救灾，切实做到以工代赈。春修工程若能善于运用灾区群众的劳力，一方面可以完成春修的任务，同时对于目前救济灾民渡过春荒，也有极大的作用。因此在灾区的工程，在保证工程完成的条件下，应尽量与救灾工作相结合。各地区灾民，有可以参加做工的壮丁，均应尽先予以工作机会，不可借口体力较弱而加拒绝。重灾区因粮食缺乏，其工款亦可以酌量拨调一部食粮。但另一方面，必须坚决掌握原订工程计划的质量与进度，保证依照标准，按期完成，因工程如做不好或做不完，便可能延长了人民的灾害。
    （四）为保证胜利完成任务，中央人民政府水利部要抓紧春修工程的全面领导，并以黄河、长江、淮河等主要河流为工作的重点。由负责干部亲赴上述地区，切实检查，并召集会议，解决各种实际问题，有关地区的行政机关负责干部必须参加并积极配合这一工作。至于全国各地方行政机关与水利机关，对所辖地区春修工作的检查与领导，亦应本此精神，切实进行。
    现在春融开始，北方工程即相继动工，南方工程虽在去冬完成一部，亦大部集中于今春，目前多尽一分力量，即可为夏防秋收增加一层保障。各地区亟应积极地动员起来，抓紧时机，为完成一九五○年春修任务而奋斗！
