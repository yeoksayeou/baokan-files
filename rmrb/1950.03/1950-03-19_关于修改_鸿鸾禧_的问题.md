On the Question of Revising "Hong Luan Xi"
    Ai Qing

    Editor's Note: After the publication of Comrade Ai Qing's "Talking About 'Hong Luan Xi'" in the 37th issue of this journal (February 26th), we received letters from two readers who both agreed with the analysis in the article and also put forward specific suggestions for revising the script. We have specially published the letter from one of the young workers. From this enthusiastic letter, it can be seen that traditional opera has a broad and profound influence among the masses, and that the awakened working class, while loving traditional opera, also has the ability to critique it. They are dissatisfied with traditional opera that has not been reformed.

    The current question is, how should traditional opera be reformed? We believe that the reform of traditional opera should, on the one hand, not violate historical truth, and on the other hand, be able to inspire the fighting spirit of the people. This work is arduous, but it is also of great significance.

    The letter and Comrade Ai Qing's reply are published together below:

    Comrade Ai Qing:

    I was very pleased and excited to read your draft of "Hong Luan Xi" published in the People's Daily. I am very interested in traditional opera, but I also feel conflicted. For example, Guan Gong killed countless Yellow Turban rebels, but the Yellow Turbans were peasants who were forced to revolt, so Guan Yun-chang is just a big butcher. But when I see Guan Gong on stage, he is extremely majestic, with his eyes not open, stroking his beard with both hands, a big red face, awe-inspiring. Therefore, I want to see all Guan Gong operas. However, in my mind, I don't think Guan Erye is a good person.

    Regarding the play "Jin Yu Nu", I would like to change the ending to: After Mo Qi becomes an official, he is corrupt and embezzling, remarries, and oppresses and exploits the people. Jin Yu Nu is pushed into the water, rescued by a fisherman, Jin Song finds Yu Nu, unites the masses, kills Mo Qi, and everyone elects Jin Song as the county magistrate, which is very satisfying. What do you think? With best regards!

       Guo Jing, March 3rd

    Comrade Guo Jing:

    I was very moved by your letter discussing how to revise "Hong Luan Xi" and proposing a specific plan. Like you, Comrade Zhen Ping also proposed a specific plan. The spirit of these two plans is the same, both wanting to make Jin Song and his daughter participate in the revolution because of Mo Qi's betrayal. You advocate that "Jin Song finds Yu Nu, unites the masses, kills Mo Qi, and everyone elects Jin Song as the county magistrate." Comrade Zhen Ping advocates, "The play should be set in the era of Li Zicheng's peasant uprising (or the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era), Jin Yu Nu is rescued by peasants, and due to the education of reality, she joins the peasant army, meets her father Jin Song, and settles accounts with Mo Qi..." From your plans, it can be seen that everyone demands the reform of traditional opera, and all want the reformed traditional opera to have a strong revolutionary character. This is a reflection of the emotions of the broad masses of our era, and this demand is understandable and valuable.

    However, I cannot completely agree with the two specific plans you have proposed. I think such revisions are very forced. In feudal society, there were many tragedies like the one suffered by Jin Yu Nu, and the inevitability of these tragedies was determined by the feudal social system. Feudal society was a society full of tragedy, and it is not in accordance with historical truth to change every traditional opera into a comedy. At the same time, I also disagree with ending our "reformed" traditional operas with scenes of mass struggle every time. This approach obviously simplifies the political nature required of a literary work. Imagine how unnatural it would be to elect Jin Song as "county magistrate"? According to this kind of spirit to revise traditional opera, we will certainly write the feudal Chinese society into a new democratic society - and indeed, some people who are reforming traditional opera are trying to completely reverse the history of society. Many scripts that originally described ancient life often awkwardly insert some new terms that are popular today, which is also an example of this kind of revision method.

    I heard that two comrades have recently revised the play "Hong Luan Xi". I have not seen it yet, and I do not know how it was revised. With best regards to you!

### 关于修改“鸿鸾禧”的问题

　　关于修改“鸿鸾禧”的问题
    艾青
    编者按：本刊三十七期（二月二十六日）发表了艾青同志的“谈《鸿鸾禧》”一文之后，收到了两位读者的来信，都赞成该文的分析，并且提出了对剧本的具体的修改的意见。我们特地发表了其中一位年青工人的来信。从这热情的信里可以看出，旧剧在群众中有着广大深刻的影响，而已经有了觉悟的工人阶级虽然爱好旧剧，却同时也有了批判能力。他们是不满意未经改革的旧剧的。
    现在的问题是，如何改革旧剧呢？我们以为改革旧剧一方面应该不违背历史的真实，同时又须能鼓舞人民群众的斗争情绪。这个工作是艰巨的，但也是有重大意义的。
    来信和艾青同志的复信一并发表如下：
    艾青同志：
    您写的《鸿鸾禧》一稿在人民日报上刊登，我看了非常同意、兴奋。我对旧剧很有兴趣，却又感觉矛盾。譬如关公杀死黄巾贼无数，而黄巾是被迫起义的农民，关云长这家伙就是个大刽子手了。但是我看见舞台上的关公，威武极了，两眼不睁，双手摸须，大红脸，威风凛凛。因此凡有关公戏，我就要看。然而在思想上，我是不认为关二爷是好人的。
    金玉奴一剧，我想把后面改为：莫稽坐官后，贪污腐化，另娶妻子，压迫、剥削人民。金玉奴被推入水中，被渔翁所救，金松找到玉奴，团结了群众，杀死莫稽，大家选金松为知县，大快人心，你道可也不可？此致敬礼！                                                   
       郭竞	三月三日郭竞同志：
    看了你的来信，谈到关于如何修改“鸿鸾禧”的问题，而且拟了一个具体的方案，你的热心使我很感动。和你一样，另外还有一位甄平同志也拟了一个具体的方案。这两个方案的精神是相同的，都是想使金松父女由于莫稽的背叛而参加了革命。你主张“金松找到玉奴，团结了群众，杀死莫稽，大家选金松为知县”。甄平同志则主张“把这个戏的时代安排在李自成的农民起义时代（或者是太平天国时代），金玉奴是被农民救起来，由于现实的教育，参加了农民军，会合了她的父亲金松，找到了莫稽作一个大清算。……”从你们的方案里，可以看出大家对旧剧要求改革，而且都是想使改革了的旧剧具有强烈的革命性，这正是我们这个时代的广大群众的情绪的反映，这种要求是可以理解的，可宝贵的。
    但是，对于你们所拟的这两个具体方案，我却不能完全同意。我觉得这样的修改是十分勉强的。在封建社会里，像金玉奴所遭受的这种悲剧原是很多的，而这种悲剧之不能避免，是由于封建的社会制度所决定的，封建社会是个充满悲剧的社会，一定要使每个旧剧都改变成喜剧，是不合历史真实的。同时，我也不同意在我们的“改革”了的旧剧里，每次都用群众斗争的场面来结束，这种办法，显然是把一个文艺作品所要求的政治性理解得十分简单化了。试想把金松选为“知县”，是多么不自然的安排呢？按照这样的一种精神来修改旧剧，一定会把封建制度的中国社会，写成新民主主义的社会——而当前也的确有些改革旧剧的人，是企图把社会的历史完全翻转过来的。许多原来描写古代生活的剧本，常常生硬的放进了一些今天所流行的新术语，也是这种修改方式的一个例子。
    听说最近已有两个同志修改了“鸿鸾禧”这个剧本，我还没有看到，也不知是怎样修改的。向你致敬礼！
