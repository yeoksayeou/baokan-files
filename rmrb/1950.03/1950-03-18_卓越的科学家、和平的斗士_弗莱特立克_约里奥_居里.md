　　An Outstanding Scientist, A Champion of Peace
    Frédéric Joliot-Curie
    M. Puleinan
    The name Frédéric Joliot-Curie immediately brings to mind two generations of outstanding scientists worldwide. Half a century ago, Pierre and Marie Curie laid the scientific foundation for the study of natural radioactivity. After years of dedicated research, they discovered and refined radium, providing medicine with a powerful weapon in the fight against disease. In our time, their son-in-law and daughter, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie, also received the Nobel Prize for their invention of artificial radioactivity. Their experiments in shattering the atomic nucleus helped achieve a scientific victory of paramount importance to humanity: the liberation of atomic energy.

    Atomic energy, in the hands of imperialists and warmongers, has become a tool for threatening peace and engaging in political blackmail. No one will forget that, when the surrender of Japanese imperialism was imminent due to the defeat of the Japanese army by the heroic Soviet forces, they still used atomic energy to massacre tens of thousands of men, women, and children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    Frédéric Joliot-Curie has always resolutely refused to serve such cannibalistic policies. He has consistently opposed keeping atomic energy a secret, as the American government has done. He fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal in the United Nations General Assembly to ban the use of atomic weapons. Joliot-Curie, a representative of peaceful science dedicated to human happiness, his call has been met with increasing response among American atomic scientists unwilling to have their labor used to commit murder, and among progressive scientists worldwide.

    In 1946, Joliot-Curie was appointed High Commissioner by the government to handle all atomic energy matters in France. The great scientist accepted this appointment but made one condition: France's atomic energy policy must be thoroughly peaceful!

    Joliot-Curie handled various complex research tasks with exceptional talent and methodical approach. He was adept at encouraging the large group of workers, engineers, technicians, and scientists working under his leadership, uniting them into a strong whole. Everything had to start from scratch. During the war, French industry suffered greatly. Coupled with the hostility and sabotage of the ruling groups, this work was even more complicated. Nevertheless, French newspapers reported as early as a year ago that Joliot-Curie had created France's first atomic experimental machine.

    Needless to say, under the current political conditions in France, Joliot-Curie's creative scientific work is becoming increasingly difficult. French reactionaries and their American masters will never allow his scientific activities to proceed smoothly.

    As early as 1939, when Joliot-Curie had just begun his experimental work, French reactionary publications launched a frenzied attack on him. Bourgeois newspapers demanded the cessation of funding for his work. They declared that such work was bound to be futile and would never yield any practical results. But in our time, Joliot-Curie's scientific research has achieved accomplishments that no one dares to deny. Why is he still being persecuted? It is precisely because his work has particularly significant peaceful implications, which do not suit the appetites of American and other imperialists who dream of making more war profits. These gentlemen continue to attack him frantically, slander and insult him, using all despicable tricks, desperately trying to seize his leadership in scientific research on atomic energy. They want to replace him with another kind of "scientist" - a docile lackey who executes the will of American imperialism.

    Reactionaries have tried to achieve these aims time and again, but Joliot-Curie's prestige and his spiritual appeal are too great, and these despicable schemes have failed time after time.

    It is not difficult to imagine that, in order to change the direction of the work he leads and make it serve atomic imperialists, the reactionaries have exhausted all the means at their disposal. But he openly and solemnly replied to all this: "If we are asked to serve aggressive war, our answer will always be 'no'!" This heroic declaration has been enthusiastically supported by a wide range of physicists and other scientists in capitalist countries. In our time, the voices of progressive scientists like Joliot-Curie will not be cries in the wilderness, as evidenced here.

    Yes, Joliot-Curie has been a progressive and peaceful man throughout his life. From the First World War to the Second World War, he consistently stood firm in his position as a warrior against fascism and against war. After the Hitler gang invaded France, he cleverly preserved all scientific data on atomic energy while being sought by the enemy.

    During the period of occupation, Joliot-Curie remained in Paris. He actively participated in the resistance movement in various ways. He organized and led the underground organization "National Front," uniting a wide range of people from all walks of life - regardless of political and religious beliefs - to fight the enemy together. But Frédéric Joliot-Curie did not stand outside the direct combat activities. Despite the advice of his comrades in the underground guerrilla forces, he bravely and personally participated in the fight.

    He obtained explosives from a comrade and hid them under the floor of his house. He personally smuggled explosives in his luggage using the railway. Once, during such a dangerous journey, he narrowly escaped the clutches of Laval's gendarmes. Because the train was temporarily out of service, he packed the explosives in a suitcase and transported them by bicycle. The gendarmes stopped him and asked to see his ID card. He had forgotten it at home and did not bring it. Only extreme composure and genius-like alertness saved him from the brink of destruction. He engaged the gendarmes in small talk and jokes for a long time, and finally they let him go without searching him…

    The war ended. While teaching at the University of France and busy with the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, Joliot-Curie continued to actively participate in the political life of his country and fight for peace. Joliot-Curie is a member of the French Communist Party - the only party that fights to the end for the freedom, independence, and happy future of the French people.

    Joliot-Curie is one of the active participants in the grand international movement to support peace. At the Paris Peace Congress, he was elected chairman of the Standing Committee. He said at the congress that people are holding a peace congress here "not to beg for peace, but to force the warmongers to accept peace." These words, like a call to struggle and action, resounded throughout all countries of the world. To those reactionaries who attempt to use the police to block the peace movement, Joliot-Curie shouted: "Truth does not need a visa to travel!"

    An erudite scientific researcher, Joliot-Curie always manages to find the time and energy to go to Prague, Moscow, and other cities of peace - wherever his personal participation can help the noble cause of national friendship - he dedicates himself entirely to this cause without reservation - success, he must come to participate.

    Frédéric Joliot-Curie, as a loyal friend of peace, is also an enthusiastic friend of the Soviet Union. He sees in socialist countries a great and strong fortress to defend the peace of the people, and an example of social fairness and justice where ordinary people enjoy freedom. He has repeatedly stated that serving as the president of the "French-Soviet Association," helping the broad masses of the French people to understand and respect the Soviet Union, is the most pleasant of the social responsibilities he undertakes.

    Joliot-Curie's struggle for peace, democracy, and communism is not accidental. His father came from the working class and had to take refuge in Belgium in order to participate in the Paris Commune. Old Joliot's stories about the glorious revolution of French workers left a deep impression on young Frédéric. He studied in Paris under the famous scientist Langevin, and after graduating from university, he worked as an engineer in a factory in Luxembourg. There he lived with the workers and mingled with them. He had long been deeply convinced of the great strength of the working class and understood their historical mission.

    This is Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a scientist, a social activist, a fighter for peace, a communist. He embodies the finest qualities of progressive international intellectuals who join hands with millions of ordinary people to defend peace and strive for democracy.

　　卓越的科学家、和平的斗士
    弗莱特立克·约里奥——居里
    Ｍ·普烈南
    一提起弗莱特立克·约里奥——居里的名字，全世界就想起了两代杰出的科学家。半世纪前，比埃尔和马利·居里奠定了关于自然放射现象的科学的基础。他们穷年累月埋头研究，终至发现和提炼了镭，使医学获得了一个对疾病斗争的有力武器。在我们的时代中，他们的女婿和女儿——弗莱特立克和伊莲·约里奥——居里也由于发明人造放射得到了诺贝尔奖金。他们击破原子核的实验工作，帮助取得了对人类有头等重大意义的科学胜利：解放原子能。
    原子能在帝国主义者和战争贩子的手中成了威胁和平进行政治敲诈的工具。没有人会忘记，在日本帝国主义的投降已因日本军队被英勇的苏军击溃而指日可待时，他们仍在广岛和长崎用原子能屠杀了几万个男女和孩子。
    弗莱特立克·约里奥——居里历来断然拒绝为这种吃人政策服务。他始终坚决反对保持原子能的秘密如美国政府所作的那样。他完全拥护苏联在联合国大会中关于禁止使用原子武器的提案。约里奥——居里，为人类谋幸福的和平科学的代表，他的呼声在不愿使自己的劳力帮助去干杀人罪行的美国原子科学家和全世界进步科学家中得到了日益广泛的响应。
    一九四六年约里奥——居里被任为政府高级专员，处理法国的一切原子能问题。这位大科学家接受这一任命，但提出了一项条件：法国对原子能的政策必须是彻底的和平政策！
    约里奥——居里以非常的才干有条不紊地处理各种复杂的研究工作。他善于鼓励在他的领导下工作的大群工人、工程师、技术员、科学家，把他们团结成一个坚强的整体。一切都得从头开始。这次战争中，法国的工业真是创痛深巨。加上统治集团的敌视和破坏的阴谋，这项工作更加复杂了。但不管怎样，法国报纸早在一年前就已报导约里奥——居里造成法国第一架原子实验机了。
    不言而喻，在当前法国的那种政治条件下，约里奥——居里的创造的科学工作越来越困难。法国反动分子及其美国主子是决不会容许他的科学活动的。
    早在一九三九年，当约里奥——居里刚刚开始自己的实验工作时，法国的反动出版物就对他进行疯狂的攻击了。资产阶级报纸要求停拨他的工作经费。它们宣称这种工作必然徒劳无功，决不会得到什么实际成绩的。但在我们这时代中，约里奥——居里的科学研究已有了无人敢否认的成就，为什么他仍受着迫害呢？就因为他的工作具有特别重大的和平意义，而不合梦想着发更多战争财的美国及其他帝国主义者胃口的缘故。这些绅士继续疯狂地攻击他，毁谤侮蔑他，使用一切卑劣的伎俩，拚命夺取他在原子能的科学研究方面的领导权。他们想用另外一种“科学家”——驯顺地执行美帝意志的走狗来代替他。
    反动分子几次三番想实现这些企图，但约里奥——居里的威望和他的精神感召太伟大，这些卑劣的阴谋都一次次落空了。
    不难想见，反动派为了达到改变他所领导的工作方向，使它为原子帝国主义者服务的目的，曾对他使尽了所有可以运用的手段。但他公开而庄严地答复这一切道：“如果要我们为侵略战争服务，我们的答复始终是一个‘不’字！”这一英勇的宣告得到了资本主义各国广大物理学家和别的科学家的热烈拥护。在我们这时代中，进步科学家如约里奥—居里的呼声不会是沙漠中的哭声，这里找到了明证了。
    是的，约里奥—居里毕生是一个进步、和平的人。第一次世界大战到第二次大战的时期内，他始终坚守着一个反对法西斯、反对战争的战士的岗位。希特勒匪党进犯法国后，他在敌人的搜求下巧妙地保存了关于原子能的全部科学资料。
    沦陷期内，约里奥——居里留在巴黎。他用各种不同的方式积极参加抵抗运动。他组织、领导了“国民阵线”这个地下组织，团结广大的各界人士——不分政治和宗教信仰一致起来对敌斗争。但弗莱特立克·约里奥——居里并不站在直接的战斗活动之外，不管地下游击军同志的劝告，他奋不顾身亲自参加了搏斗。
    他从一个同志那里取得炸药藏在家里的地板下。他把炸药放在皮囊中亲自利用铁路偷运炸药。有一次在作这种危险的旅行时，他千钧一发地逃过了赖伐尔宪兵的掌握。这次由于火车暂时不通，他把炸药装在行李袋内骑自行车运送。宪兵叫住他，要看他的身份证。他忘记在家里，没有带。只是极度的镇静和天才的机警才把他从毁灭的边缘救出来。他用扯谈和笑话缠住了这些宪兵好久，终于他们没有搜查就把他放走了………
    战争结束了。在法兰西大学授课，忙着原子能委员会工作，约里奥—居里仍积极参加本国的政治生活，为和平而斗争。约里奥—居里是法国共产党——宪法国人民的自由、独立和幸福的未来而斗争到底的唯一政党——的党员。
    约里奥—居里是盛大的国际拥护和平运动的积极活动家之一。在巴黎拥护和平大会上，他被选为常设委员会主席。他在大会上说：人们在这里开拥护和平大会，“不是为了请求和平，而是迫使战争贩子接受和平”，这几句话像斗争和行动的号召响遍了全世界所有的国家。对那些企图以警察来阻挡和平运动的反动派，约里奥—居里喝道：“真理走路不需要签证！”
    渊博的科学研究者，约里奥—居里总能抽出时间，精神百倍地到布拉格、莫斯科和别的和平城市去——不论什么地方，只要他的亲身参加可以帮助民族友好这个崇高事业——他毫不保留地把自己整个地奉献这事业——成功，他必定赶来参加的。
    弗莱特立克·约里奥—居里作为和平的忠实友人，也是苏联的热情的朋友。他在社会主义国家中看出了保卫人民和平的伟大、坚强的堡垒，社会公平合理、普通人享有自由的榜样。他屡次声明，他担任“法苏协会”会长，帮助法国广大人民认识苏联敬爱苏联，是他所负的社会职责中最愉快的一件。
    约里奥——居里为和平、民主、共产主义而斗争，不是偶然的。他的父亲出身工人阶级，为了参加巴黎工社不得不避难到比利时。老约里奥关于法国工人光荣革命的故事对青年弗莱特立克留下了深刻的印象。他在巴黎受业于名科学家郎之万的门下，大学毕业后，到卢森堡的一所工厂中当工程师。那里他和工人一起生活，和他们打成一片。他早就深信工人阶级的伟大力量，明白他们的历史任务了。
    这就是弗莱特立克·约里奥——居里，科学家，社会活动家，和平的斗士，共产主义者。他的身上集中表现了和千百万老百姓携手保卫和平争取民主的进步国际知识分子最优良的品质。
