　　Shenyang State-Owned and Public Enterprises
    Sign Collective Contracts to Guarantee Production
    Promoting Administrative Management and Trade Union Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily news: In the five months of the new record movement, nine state-owned and public enterprises in Shenyang City have signed collective contracts, effectively guaranteeing production, promoting administrative management, enriching the content of trade unions facing production, and gaining initial experience in signing collective contracts. The nine collective contracts signed in the city can be roughly divided into three types: short-term collective contracts, simple production contracts that do not include welfare, labor insurance, etc., and contracting contracts for completing a specific task. Such as the renovation contract of the Chemical Experiment Factory and the safety contract of the Mechanical Experiment Factory. Since the signing of collective contracts, the completion of production tasks in various factories has been reliably guaranteed, and some have even exceeded production plans. The Mechanical Third Factory signed three collective contracts from September to December last year, and successfully completed the tasks every month, and some months even exceeded the tasks. Taking December as an example after the Kiln General Factory signed the contract: the crushing department exceeded the task by 14%, the mud mixing, molding, and board picking exceeded by 23.38%, the quality was improved by 50%, and the consumption rate was reduced. Secondly, due to the signing of collective contracts, the trade unions of various factories have been able to actively grasp production plans. For example, the trade union of the Mechanical Third Factory, in accordance with the content of the collective contract, has led various workshops to sign liaison contracts, making the allocation of procedures in the workshop more organized. Jia Zhibang, director of the East Factory Branch of the Mechanical Sixth Factory, went deep into the workshop and worked night shifts with the workers to help study the reduction of waste castings, which effectively promoted production. Thirdly, due to the signing of collective contracts, various factories have been supervised by the broad masses and gradually improved various systems. For example, when the Mechanical Third Factory inspected the implementation of the contract in November and December, the workers raised criticisms and suggestions for improvement on phenomena such as waste of materials and waste by foundry workers. The Mechanical First Factory accepted the workers' suggestions, added a grinder, and improved the phenomenon of workers wasting working hours by queuing to sharpen knives. At the same time, various factories have begun to adopt more reasonable wage systems in the process of signing contracts, such as the initial piece-rate bonus system. To a certain extent, it stimulated the enthusiasm of workers for production.
    According to the experience of Shenyang's public enterprises, the following issues should be noted in the process of signing collective contracts: First, the content of the contract must implement the spirit of "developing production and taking into account both public and private interests." For example, in terms of quotas: it is necessary to educate workers to overcome conservative ideas and support new quotas; but also to prevent quotas from being too high, affecting workers' enthusiasm for work. For example, the bricklaying task of the Kiln General Factory was set too high, and the task could not be completed without overtime, which affected the workers' emotions and was detrimental to their health. The stipulations on wages should also not be too high or too low; before there are standard quotas, a piece-rate bonus system should generally be implemented to stimulate workers to improve production. But at the same time, attention must be paid to labor protection, and there must be appropriate restrictions on workers' overtime work. Second, full democracy must be promoted in the process of signing the contract. Before signing the contract, sufficient publicity and education must be carried out, the terms of the contract must be repeatedly deliberated and discussed by the group, and finally signed and approved at the mass meeting. After signing, it must be regularly and carefully checked. Only in this way can workers be valued, understand the importance of the state's production tasks and their own responsibilities, so as to improve their production enthusiasm. Third, in order to ensure the realization of production tasks, the trade union should formulate its own specific plan according to the contract, lead various workshops to sign liaison contracts, launch groups and individuals to sign production plans, organize production competition movements, and pay attention to checking the degree of implementation of the contract and actively put forward suggestions for improvement.

　　沈阳国营公营企业
    订集体合同保证生产
    推动了行政管理工作和工会工作
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：在五个月来的新纪录运动中，沈阳市国营公营企业中，有九个单位已订立集体合同，有力的保证了生产，推动了行政管理工作，充实了工会面向生产的内容，并获得订立集体合同的初步经验。该市已订立的九个集体合同，大致可分三种类型，即短期集体合同，不包括福利、劳保等内容的单纯生产合同，为完成某一项特定任务的包工合同。如化工实验厂的装修合同及机械实验厂的安全合同。自订立集体合同后，各工厂完成生产任务得到可靠保证，有的并超过了生产计划。机械三厂从去年九月到十二月，共订立三次集体合同，每月都胜利完成任务，有些月份且超过了任务。窑业总厂自订立合同后，以十二月份为例：粉碎部超过任务百分之十四，合泥、成型、挑板超过百分之二三·三八，质量提高百分之五十，并降低了消耗率。其次，由于订立了集体合同，各厂工会已能主动掌握生产计划。如机械三厂工会，已按照集体合同内容，领导各车间订立了联系合同，使车间调配工序更有条理。机械六厂东厂支会主任贾治邦则深入车间，和工人一起打夜班，帮助研究减少铸件废活，有力的推动了生产。第三，各厂由于订立了集体合同，得到广大群众的监督，逐渐健全了各种制度。如机械三厂在十一、十二月份检查合同执行情形时，工人对待料、铸工浪费等现象，都提出了批评和改进意见。机械一厂接受工人意见，增设砂轮机，改进了工人站队磨刀浪费工时的现象。同时各厂在订立合同中，开始采用较合理的工资制度，如初步的超额奖励制等。在一定程度上刺激了工人的生产积极性。
    根据沈阳公营企业的经验，在订立集体合同过程中，应注意下面几个问题：第一，合同内容必须贯彻“发展生产，公私兼顾”的精神。比如在定额方面：既要教育工人克服保守主义思想，拥护新定额；也要防止定额过高，影响工人劳动热情，如窑业总厂打砖任务定的过高，非加班不能完成任务，结果影响工人情绪，且有碍工人健康。在工资的规定上，同样不宜过高或过低；在没有标准的定额以前，一般应实行超额奖励制，以刺激工人提高生产。但同时必须注意劳动保护工作，对工人的加班加点要有适当限制。第二，订立合同的过程中，必须充分发扬民主。合同订立前要作充分的宣传教育，合同条件要经过小组反复酝酿讨论，最后在群众大会上签字通过。订立后，则须定期认真的检查。只有这样才能引起工人重视，懂得国家生产任务的重要性和自己的责任，以提高其生产积极性。第三，为保证生产任务的实现，工会应根据合同订出自己的具体计划，领导各车间订立联系合同，发动小组与个人订生产计划，组织生产竞赛运动，并要注意检查合同的执行程度，主动提出改进意见。
