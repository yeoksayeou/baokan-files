　　Liulihe Cement Factory Repairs Electric Motor
    Saving 70,000 Jin of Millet per Month
    Costs Reduced by Two Percent
    [Our Newspaper] The workers of the Liulihe Cement Factory displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity by repairing a 95HP electric motor that had been burned out during the Kuomintang era. It replaced the original 300HP electric motor that drove the pump supplying cooling water to the factory's machines. Since it was put into use on January 29th, the results have been good. It saves 100 HWK degrees of electricity per hour compared to the original 300HP electric motor. On a monthly basis, this saves 72,000 HWK degrees, equivalent to 72,000 jin of millet, reducing the cost of producing each ton of cement by two percent. The 95HP electric motor was burned out due to poor supervision during the Kuomintang period. At that time, the Cement Company of the Resources Committee, which led the factory, sent people to inspect and repair it many times, but it was not repaired. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers established a new attitude towards labor. Zhang Kun, an old worker in the power division with many years of technical experience, and six others including Zhu Zhenmin, first proposed a trial repair. Military Representative Tian Guangbi accepted and encouraged them. The workers seriously sought solutions, overcoming various difficulties in materials and tools during the repair work. For example, three workers including Zhu Zhenmin, Cao F绵, and Cheng Ruizhang, found a place where the Japanese and puppet regimes used coke to build tunnels and dug out a lot of usable coke because they did not have coke for forging and welding. Silver solder used for electric welding was expensive and difficult to buy. Zhang Kun (who was promoted to deputy section chief after liberation) led everyone to find a solution. After many welding tests, they gained experience and overcame the difficulties. In a total of two months (repaired outside of working hours), the 109 steel bars and steel wires inside the motor that were mainly burned were properly packaged, completing the repair task.

　　琉璃河水泥厂修复电动马达
    月省小米七万余斤     
    成本减低百分之二
    【本报讯】琉璃河水泥厂的工友们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，修复了国民党时代烧毁的９５ＨＰ电动马达，代替了原带动供应厂内机器冷却水泵用水的３００ＨＰ电动马达，自一月二十九日使用以来，结果良好，比原有３００ＨＰ电动马达每小时节省用电量１００ＨＷＫ度，以月计每月可省７２０００ＨＷＫ度，合小米七万二千斤，使生产每吨水泥的成本减低百分之二。９５ＨＰ电动马达是由于国民党时期看管不严而被烧毁的。当时领导该厂的资源委会水泥公司曾多次派人检查和修理，仍没修好。解放后，在共产党的领导下，工友们树立了新的劳动态度。该厂动力股有多年技术经验的老工人张琨、朱振民等七人首先提出试修建议。军代表田光璧接受并鼓励了他们。工友们认真想办法，克服了在进行修复工作中的材料、工具上的各种困难。如朱振民、曹福绵、程瑞章等三工友、在锻焊时没有焦炭，他们找到了日伪时代用焦炭来堪地道的地方，挖出来很多能用的焦炭。电焊时用的银腊贵又不好买，张琨（解放后被提拔为副股长）领导大家想办法，经过多次试焊，取得了经验，克服了困难。总共两个月的时间（是在工作时间外修理），将马达内部主要被烧毁的一百零九根钢棒和钢线包装妥善，完成了修复的任务。
