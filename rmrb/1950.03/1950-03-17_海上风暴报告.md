　　Sea Storm Report
　　by Jiao Fuchun
　　On the fourth day, the sentry reported that four boats were coming from the due east, looking like the enemy. Each squad moved into position, preparing for battle. The company commander told everyone: "No one is allowed to fire until the enemy lands. We must capture a few boats." The four boats stopped about two and a half miles from the island. From the island, several ragged soldiers on the bow were waving a tattered blue cloth. It was hard to make out a bandit flag unless you looked closely. They also didn't fire, but blew a piercing, broken horn, babbling incoherently on the boats. No one could understand what they were shouting. After a while, the enemy threw something from the boat, and then two people swam towards the isolated island. The platoon leader pointed his gun at them and shouted, "Don't move!" They waved a white cloth and shouted, "Don't shoot! We're here to save you!" The company commander told them to come up. It turned out they were two sailors who had been captured by the bandit army. They brought a letter that read:
　　"...If you don't surrender, you'll starve to death! Come over and each of you will be promoted three ranks... Otherwise, we will send a telegram to the President to send planes and warships to annihilate you."
　　The company commander thought this was a good opportunity to lure the enemy to land, so he told Deputy Platoon Leader Xie and Comrade Xiao Wu, who understood the local dialect, to shout:
　　"Come quickly! We want you to save us! Come on!..."
　　After calling out for a long time, the enemy did not dare to take a step forward.
　　Deputy Platoon Leader Xie dejectedly reported to the company commander: "They're not coming, what should we do?"
　　"Give me two hand grenades, I'll take a raft and go find these undead!" Deputy Platoon Leader Xie immediately thought of a good plan.
　　"That's like using meat to beat a dog!" Company Commander Wang said.
　　The enemy didn't see any more soldiers than the two of us, and didn't know how many troops there were. After hesitating for a long time, they turned around and fled.
　　From the two newly arrived sailors, we learned that it was the bandit Huang Bameizi's gang, with more than eighty people and nineteen boats on an island about seven or eight miles east of here.
　　The raft that the enemy sent the sailors on greatly inspired our confidence in creating rafts. Therefore, the leadership decided to make rafts ourselves and send people to deliver letters.

　　The only household on this island was a father and son. The first day they saw a row of comrades, they trembled with fear.
　　They didn't know about the "Kuomintang" or the "Communist Party," they only knew about planting two acres of sweet potatoes and raising ten chicks. In the past ten years or so, the pirates had terrified them. About six years ago, a "Japanese devil" came. In addition to snatching the chickens, one of the "Japanese devils" tapped the small house several times with his big leather boots. The old man knelt down and called him "master." He knew that one kick of the leather boot would cause his "little world to collapse!" In recent years, Kuomintang bandits had also come, calling themselves "National Army," and snatched away his dried sweet potatoes and chickens. These years had been very difficult, but the father and son had managed to survive without starving to death.
　　These soldiers only said they wanted to buy sweet potatoes to eat, and didn't ask for rice or chickens. The old man was curious and secretly asked his son, "They're paying for sweet potatoes! What's going on?" That night, a soldier squeezed onto their bed. The old man and his son were so frightened that they didn't close their eyes all night.
　　At dawn, the old man asked his son, "We have to talk to the officer and tell him not to let his soldiers steal things or kick the house." Just then, the soldier sleeping on the haystack got up. He went over and pushed the soldier on the bed: "Company commander! Are we still cooking sweet potatoes?" The son whispered, "Oh! That's the company commander on the bed!" The old man said, "What company commander?" The son said, "A company commander is a big official who can manage hundreds of people." After the company commander got up at dawn, he spoke very politely to the old man. The old man didn't understand most of it, but the son understood some of it, and knew that this company commander was a good person.
　　Many soldiers sleeping in the open also called him "Grandpa" incessantly. Only then did he believe: "These are all good people."
　　But later, when they saw that these soldiers had no intention of leaving, they panicked again! They thought, "If they keep eating like this for another ten days, a year's worth of food will be gone!" So they started crying in front of the company commander.
　　"Grandpa, we don't want to live here, but we really have no choice because our boat is broken. We will definitely be able to go back in the future, and then we will return your rice!" The company commander comforted the father and son.
　　The old man and his son were afraid that if these forty-odd people stayed any longer, they would eat desperately themselves. Finally, they even took out the hidden fish and ate them. After they finished eating, they sat and cried. The soldiers didn't know the reason and joked that they were eating "health food."
　　As time went by, they saw that the soldiers ate sweet potato leaves porridge every day and didn't bother them at all. The old man secretly told his son, "These people are too good, kind-hearted people will be saved, God bless them!" From then on, they stopped eating and drinking excessively.
　　During this period, the bandits came twice, but were driven away by the soldiers with a volley of gunfire. After that, the bandits often harassed them, but did not dare to land on the island. The old man knew that these people were amazing and very powerful, but he wondered why these people were so fierce to the bandits but so honest to the common people? He and his son pondered for a long time, and finally understood: They are soldiers who save the common people!
　　Gradually, the old man became familiar with the soldiers, and also learned a lot of new things, such as "People's Liberation Army," "Communist Party," and "Chairman Mao." During meetings, everyone often mentioned "Chairman Mao," so he concluded that Chairman Mao must be an even better person.

　　海上风暴报告
    矫福纯作
    第四天，哨兵报告正东来了四只船，看样像敌人；各班都进入阵地，准备战斗，连长告诉大家：“敌人不登陆谁都不准打枪，一定要缴获几条船。”四条船在离岛二里多的地方停止了，从岛上望去，船头上几个破兵挥舞着一块破蓝布，不仔细看并看不出是一面匪党旗，他们亦不打枪，吹起刺耳的破号，在船上唧唧哇哇的乱嚷，谁也听不懂喊了些什么。住了一会，敌人从船上扔下了个东西，接着两个人向孤岛游来，被排长一枪指住“不要动”，他们摇着一块白布直喊：“勿要打！阿拉是来救倷的！”连长说叫他上来，一看是两个被匪军捉去的水手，他们带来一封信，上面写着：
    “……你们不投降就饿死啦！过来每人可官升三级……否则我们将打电报给总统，派机舰来歼灭你们。”
    连长认为这是诱敌人登陆的好机会，于是叫谢排副和懂本地话的战士小吴去喊话：
    “快来呀！我们要你们来救呀！来呀！……”
    招呼了半天，敌人不敢进前一步。
    谢排副垂头丧气回报连长：“他们都不来，怎么办？”
    “给我两个手榴弹，坐着木筏去，去找这些不死的！”谢排副立刻又想了个妙计。
    “那是拿肉打狗！”王连长说。
    敌人除了看到我们两个人以外，再什么也没见，不知有多少兵马，犹豫了半天，掉头逃走。
    从两个刚来的水手口中，我们了解了是土匪黄八妹子帮，在东面离此七八里路的岛上，有八十多人，十九条船。
    敌人送来水手乘的木筏子，大大启发了我们创造木筏子的信心。于是领导上决定自做木筏，派人送信。

    这个岛上的独户人家，只有父子俩，他们第一天看见一排的同志们时，吓得打哆嗦。
    他们不知道“国民党”和“共产党”，只知道种的二亩地瓜和喂的十只小鸡，近十几年来，海匪使他怕极了。大概六年前来个“鬼子”，除了抢走鸡子外，有个“鬼子”大皮靴照着小屋子比了好几下，老头跪着喊老爷，他知道皮靴一踢“小天地就塌了”！最近几年来，国民党匪帮也来过，口称“国军”，抢走了他的地瓜干和鸡。这些年头，日子很难过，父子们总还残存下来，没有饿死。
    这帮兵只说买地瓜吃，并没要米和鸡，老头好奇，偷偷的问他的儿子：“吃地瓜还给钱！啥景？”那天夜里他们床上还挤上了个兵。老头和儿子骇得一夜没有合眼。
    傍亮天，老头问儿子：“得找当官的说几句老话，别叫他的兵抢东西，踢房子。”正好睡在草堆里的兵也起来了，他走过去推推床上那个兵：“连长！还煮地瓜吗？”儿子悄悄说：“哟！床上这个是连长！”老头说：“什么连长？”儿子说：“连长能管几百人的大官。”天亮连长起身后，很客气的对老人说了许多话，老头大部分没听懂，儿子听懂了一些，知道这个连长是个好人。
    那些睡在露天地里的许多兵，见了他也都“老大爷”的喊个不息。这时他才相信：“这都是些好人。”
    可是后来，他们看到这些兵一点也没有走的意思，又着慌了！心想：“这样再吃下十天去，一年的食粮就完了！”于是他们就在连长面前哭起来。
    “老大爷，我们不是愿意住在这里，实在因为我们船破了没有办法，将来我们一定能回去，那时候我们还你大米！”连长安慰着父子俩。
    老头和儿子恐怕这四十多个人再住下去，自己就拚命的吃，最后连藏着的鱼都拿出来吃了，吃完了就坐着哭。战士们并不知其中原因，还开玩笑说他们吃的“保健饭”。
    日子久了，他们看见战士们天天吃地瓜叶的稀饭，一点也不来麻烦他们。老头又悄悄告诉儿子：“这帮人太好了，心善的人会能得救，老天爷保佑他们！”从此他们就停止了大吃大喝。
    这期间曾来过两次土匪，都叫这帮兵一顿枪打跑了，此后土匪常来骚扰，可是不敢上岛，老头知道了这帮人了不起，挺厉害，可是他想想为什么这帮人对土匪这样厉害而对老百姓这样老实呢？他和他儿子考究了半天，最后终于明白了：他们是救老百姓的兵！
    渐渐地老头和战士们熟了起来，也知道了好多新的事情，什么“解放军”“共产党”“毛主席”。开会时，大家常常提到“毛主席”，因此他断定毛主席一定是一个更好的人。
