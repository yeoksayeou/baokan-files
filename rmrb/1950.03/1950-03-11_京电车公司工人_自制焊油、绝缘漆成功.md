Beijing News: Workers at the Beijing Tram Company's repair shop, including electrician Guan Chengyu, have successfully produced their own soldering flux and insulating varnish, reducing manufacturing costs by one-third to one-half compared to buying them from outside. Since the factory rewarded employees who contributed to the self-made automatic brake boxes and fire glass rings last November, the workers' enthusiasm and creativity have further increased. Recently, electricians Guan Chengyu and Hu Zhiyi, noting that the soldering flux used by the electrical team was not only expensive when purchased from outside but also contained acidity, causing a corrosive side effect when soldering motor copper heads, devoted themselves to research, wanting to make their own soldering flux. After two failures, they finally succeeded with the help of electrician Yuan Fengxiang. The cost is 35% cheaper than buying from outside, and there is no corrosive side effect. The insulating varnish used by the factory's electrical team is expensive and has low pressure when purchased from outside. Electricians Li Peigen, Guan Yushou, and Zhang Demin also tried to make their own, and after three failures, they finally succeeded with the help of electrician Yuan Fengxiang and engineer Wang Zihou. The cost is half the price of buying it from outside, and the pressure is also higher.

    自制焊油、绝缘漆成功
    【北京讯】电车公司修造厂电工关成玉等自制焊油和绝缘漆成功，制造费比外买价格减低三分之一到一半。该厂自去年十一月对自制自动闸盒和火玻璃圈有贡献的职工加以奖励之后，工人们的积极性和创造性更见提高。最近电工关成玉、胡志颐鉴于电工班所使的焊油，外买的不但价格高并且都含有酸性，焊马达铜头时，带有消蚀副作用，二人就潜心研究，想自造焊油。经过两次失败，终于在电工袁凤祥帮助下，研究成功。成本比外买便宜百分之三十五，并且没有消蚀副作用。该厂电工班用的绝缘漆，外买的价格高而且压力小。电工李培根、关玉寿、张德敏三个人也设法自制，经过三次失败，最后在电工袁凤祥、工程师王子厚帮助下，试验成功。成本比外买的便宜一半，压力也较大。
