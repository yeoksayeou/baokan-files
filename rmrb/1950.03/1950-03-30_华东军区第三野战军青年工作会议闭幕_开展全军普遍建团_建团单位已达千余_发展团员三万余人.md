Xinhua News Agency: The Youth Work Conference of the East China Military Region and the People's Liberation Army Third Field Army Political Department, which opened on March 15th, concluded on the 22nd after eight days. More than 50 representatives from various military regions, corps, armies, logistics departments, special columns, navy, air force, East China Military and Political University, and directly subordinate units of the military region attended the meeting. The conference summarized the preliminary experience of the army in experimentally establishing the New Democratic Youth League in the past six months, studied and determined the future direction of universal League building throughout the army, and the tasks of the army's youth work in 1950. The conference pointed out that youth in the Third Field Army account for about 60% of the total number of people, and most of them have not yet joined the Party, while the urgent demands of youth in the army for political progress objectively provide a profound foundation for comprehensive League building in the army. Therefore, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Youth League, it is entirely necessary and possible to universally build the League throughout the army. On the other hand, youth work in the army has been stagnant for a long time, and political organs at all levels no longer have organizational structures and full-time cadres for youth work. Most cadres below the battalion level are not familiar with this work, so building the League in the army is a new task, and some difficulties must be overcome, starting from scratch. Since the East China Military Region and the People's Liberation Army Third Field Army Political Department issued instructions on establishing the New Democratic Youth League in August last year, all subordinate units, organs, and schools have successively carried out preparatory work for League building. Moreover, except for a few units with heavy combat missions, most units, organs, and schools have conducted experimental League building. A few schools and units, and military region organs and units have begun universal League building. According to incomplete statistics, there are now 1,146 League building units in the army, with a total of 33,565 League members.

General Guidelines for League Building: Prepare, Prioritize, Differentiate, and Gradually Carry Out Universal League Building.

Based on the above situation, the conference determined that the general guideline for universal League building in the future is: to prepare, prioritize, differentiate, and carefully and gradually carry out universal League building. Preparation mainly refers to ideological preparation, cadre preparation, and experience preparation. First of all, the Communist Party committees and political organs at all levels must attach due importance to this work, earnestly study and implement the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Youth League, and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission on League building, and organize learning and research among cadres at all levels. At the same time, gradually establish youth work organizations at all levels under the leadership of political organs, train and equip appropriate youth work cadres, and even if they are not fully equipped for the time being, designate someone to concurrently manage them, and vigorously cultivate and train League building backbones. When conditions are ripe, carry out experimental League building to gain experience and promote comprehensiveness. Prioritization refers to identifying key units and gradually promoting them, rather than using forces evenly. Generally, in organs, schools, and companies where there are many young people, few Party members, new elements, weak Communist Party organizations, or many old personnel, the demand for League building is most urgent. Secondly, rear organs, schools, and other units, urban garrison organs and troops, and military region troops in old liberated areas generally have the most favorable conditions and should also build the League earlier. Units with the most urgent demands, the greatest need for work, and the most favorable conditions should be used as the focus of League building. However, attention must be paid to the mutual coordination between key and non-key units, points, and surfaces. Differentiation refers to determining the specific guidelines, steps, and methods for League building based on the specific conditions of each unit. Units where conditions are not ripe should earnestly do a good job in preparation. Units that have carried out typical experiments should work hard to prepare cadres and summarize experiences in order to enter universal League building. Units that have begun universal League building should enter comprehensive League building and continuously pay attention to consolidation and improvement, and continue to accumulate and popularize experience. Carefulness means that we must first understand that League building work is related to the basic construction work of Party and army building in the future. In the process of League building, we must contact the masses, combine with military and political tasks, and advance correctly and steadily. It is better to build later and build effectively than to build early and become a formality; but we must never delay or wait because of this. If there are conditions, we cannot be slow; if the conditions are not sufficient, we must strive to create them.

Five Specific Tasks for Youth Work This Year

The conference studied and determined the specific tasks of the army's youth work in 1950:

(1) Call on and educate the youth of the entire army to ensure the completion of the six major tasks put forward by the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army's CCP Front Committee, first of all, to strive for the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the remaining enemies along the coast.

(2) In 1950-51, complete the universal League building work in the entire army, and cultivate and train youth work cadres at all levels, and establish and improve youth work organizations at all levels.

(3) Widely carry out the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously improve the class consciousness and theoretical level of the youth in the army.

(4) Carry out literary and sports activities, carry out cultural learning campaigns, gradually eliminate illiteracy, and improve the scientific and cultural level of the army.

(5) Carry out unity and progress movements, promote revolutionary heroism, encourage initiative and ambition, and complete the task of consolidating the army.

　　华东军区第三野战军青年工作会议闭幕
    开展全军普遍建团  建团单位已达千余  发展团员三万余人
    【本报讯】据新华社电：华东军区暨人民解放军第三野战军政治部于三月十五日召开的全军青年工作会议，历时八天，已于二十二日闭幕。出席会议的有各军区、各兵团、各军、后勤部、特种纵队、海军、空军、华东军政大学以及军区直属队的代表五十余人。会议总结了半年来全军实验建立新民主主义青年团的初步经验，研究并确定了今后全军普遍建团的方针和一九五○年全军青年工作的任务。会议指出：第三野战军全军青年占总人数百分之六十左右，而其中大部分还未入党，而部队青年对政治进步的迫切要求，是部队中客观上具备了全面建团的深厚基础。因此在共产党和团中央领导下，全军普遍建团是完全必要，而且可能的。另一方面，部队青年工作曾长期停顿，各级政治机关已没有青年工作的组织机构与专职干部，营以下干部多半对这一工作不熟悉，所以部队建团又是一件新的工作，还要克服某些困难，从头做起。华东军区暨人民解放军第三野战军政治部自去年八月颁发关于建立新民主主义青年团的指示以来，所属各部队、机关、学校等都先后进行了建团的准备工作，而且除少数作战任务繁重的部队外，多数部队、机关、学校都进行了建团的实验工作；并有少数学校单位和军区机关、部队已开始普遍建团。据不完全统计，现全军建团单位已有一千一百四十六个，共发展团员三万三千五百六十五人。
    建团总方针：有准备、有重点、有分别地逐步开展普遍建团工作。
    会议根据上述情况，确定了今后普遍建团的总方针是：有准备、有重点、有分别、认真地逐步开展普遍建团工作。有准备主要是指思想准备，干部准备与经验准备。首先各级共产党党委与政治机关必须予以应有的重视，切实研究与贯彻中共中央、青年团中央、人民革命军事委员会总政治部的建团决议，并在各级干部中组织学习、研究；同时逐步建立在政治机关领导下的各级青年工作组织机构，训练与配备适当的青年工作干部，即使一时配备不齐，也应指定专人兼管，并大力培养与训练建团骨干；条件成熟即进行实验建团，以取得经验，推动全面。有重点是指确定重点单位，逐步推广，不要平均使用力量。一般是在青年多、党员少，成分新、共产党的组织较弱或旧人员较多的机关、学校与连队中，建团要求最迫切。其次是后方机关、学校及其他单位，城市警备机关和部队，老解放区的军区部队一般条件最为具备，亦应提先建团。凡是要求最迫切，工作最需要，条件最具备的单位就应作为建团的重点；但必须注意重点与非重点单位、点与面的互相配合。有分别是指根据各个部队的具体情况决定建团的具体方针、步骤与方法；条件不成熟的单位应切实做好准备工作，已进行典型实验的单位应努力准备干部与总结经验，以进入普遍建团；已开始普遍建团的单位应进入全面建团，并不断注意巩固与提高，继续积累与普及经验。认真就是首先必须了解建团工作是有关今后建党建军的基本建设工作，在建团过程中必须联系群众，结合军政任务，正确地稳步地前进。宁可迟建而建得有效，不要早建而流为形式；但又决不能因此而拖延或等待。有了条件就不能迟缓，条件不够要努力创造。
    今年青年工作五项具体任务
    会议研究与确定了一九五○年全军青年工作的具体任务是：
    （一）号召与教育全军青年，保证完成华东军区及第三野战军中共前线委员会提出的六大任务，首先是为解放台湾、肃清沿海残敌的光荣任务而努力。
    （二）在一九五○——五一年，完成全军普遍建团工作，并培养与训练各级青年工作干部，建立与健全各级青年工作组织机构。
    （三）广泛进行马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育，不断地提高部队青年的阶级觉悟与理论水平。
    （四）开展文艺体育活动，开展文化学习运动，逐步消灭文盲，提高部队的科学文化水平。
