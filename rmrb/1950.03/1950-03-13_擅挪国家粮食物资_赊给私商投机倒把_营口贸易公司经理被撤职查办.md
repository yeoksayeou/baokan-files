　　Embezzling National Grain and Materials, Extending Credit to Private Merchants for Speculation:
    Yingkou Trading Company Manager Dismissed and Investigated
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily on February 24th, Zang Hongyun, manager of the Yingkou County Trading Company, and Wang Qiang, director of the business department, violated the law and neglected their duties, losing their political stance. They have now been dismissed and handed over to the court for punishment. The main errors committed by these individuals include the following:

    (1) Last spring, when the area experienced a severe grain shortage, the state transported a large quantity of grain from northern Manchuria, entrusting the company to sell and regulate the food supply. However, the company sold the vast majority of the grain on credit to the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xudong and private merchants at Minsheng Grain Store, Tongxing Freight Forwarding, and the Workers' Sales Office (composed of temporary workers from the company). Among these, the credit extended to Zhao Xudong's family alone amounted to over 2,210,600 jin of various grains. Moreover, no price was set at the time, allowing Zhao Xudong to settle accounts with the company based on the falling market price after grain prices declined, resulting in significant losses to state property. This kind of right-leaning thinking completely abandoned the position of state commercial cadres serving the people.

    (2) Violating cash management regulations, accumulating state funds. The company extended credit for state materials to the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xudong amounting to 6.79 billion yuan, and to private merchants Minsheng Grain Store, Tongxing Freight Forwarding, and the Workers' Sales Office amounting to 6.67 billion yuan. Credit extended to 32 cooperatives totaled 21.0296 billion yuan. After the government announced the cash management system on April 15th of last year, the company still failed to promptly clear and correct the credit, only settling the accounts successively in September of last year, resulting in the accumulation of funds and losses to the state. In particular, the huge amount of funds extended to unscrupulous merchants further fueled their speculation and disruption of the market.

    (3) Losing political stance, engaging in corruption and degeneration. Zang Hongyun, the company manager, accepted a fountain pen inlaid with gold from the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xudong, as well as a gramophone. Wang Qiang, the director of the business department, in addition to accepting a gramophone and a Parker 51 pen, also freely allowed Zhao Xudong's sister to view the company's accounts, inventory numbers, price instructions, and internal telegrams. At times, Wang Qiang even gave these documents to Zhao Xudong to read, exposing state secrets.

    (4) Serious bureaucracy. Zang Ping rarely studied instructions from higher authorities and lost more than 40 documents and instructions during this statistic gathering process. He was also irresponsible in his work, with everything being handled by Wang Qiang. Zang rarely visited the department store after it was established, and only visited the warehouse twice. At the same time, he also used funds allocated by the province for the construction of warehouses to build dormitories for himself and Wang Qiang's wife. After verification by the Provincial Department of Commerce, the above information was found to be true, and he has been dismissed and sent to the court for processing.

　　擅挪国家粮食物资  赊给私商投机倒把
    营口贸易公司经理被撤职查办
    【本报讯】据东北日报二月二十四日消息：营口县贸易公司经理臧洪云、营业部主任王强违法渎职，丧失立场，现已撤职交法院惩处。该犯等所犯错误主要有以下几项：
    （一）在去年春天该区有严重粮荒时，国家从北满运来大批粮食，交该公司出售调剂民食，而该公司却将绝大部分粮食赊卖给奸商赵旭东及私商民生粮栈、同兴货栈、工人推销处（系公司打零工人组成）；其中赊给奸商赵旭东一家即有各种粮食二百二十一万零六百余斤，而且当时不作价，让赵旭东于粮价落后按下落的市价与公司结账，造成国家财产的重大损失。此种右倾思想完全失掉国家商业干部为人民服务的立场。
    （二）破坏现金管理法令，积压国家资金。该公司将国家物资前后赊给奸商赵旭东六十七亿九千余万元，赊给私商民生粮栈、同兴货栈、工人推销处六十六亿七千余万元；赊给三十二个合作社总值二百十亿零二百九十六万余元。去年四月十五日政府公布现金管理制度后，该公司仍未及时清理和纠正赊欠，直到去年九月才先后结清，使资金积压，国家受到损失；尤其是赊给奸商的巨额资金，更助长了他们投机捣把，扰乱市场。
    （三）失掉立场，贪污腐化。该公司经理臧洪云曾接受奸商赵旭东用一钱金子给他镶的钢笔，以及留声机；营业部主任王强除接受留声机、五一派克笔外，更随便让奸商赵旭东的妹妹看公司的账及库存物资数目和物价指示、内部电报等，有时王强把这些文件还送给赵旭东看，暴露国家秘密。
    （四）严重的官僚主义。臧平素对上级指示不很好研究，这次统计还丢失文件指示等四十多件，在工作上亦不负责任，一切事情由王强包办，臧自百货部成立后很少去，仓库也只去过两次，同时并动用省方拨来修建仓库费用，给自己和王强老婆修宿舍。现经省商业厅检查属实后，已撤职送法院处理。
