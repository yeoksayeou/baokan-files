TASS, Rome, March 21st: Reports state that the repressive measures taken by Italian authorities against peasant movement leaders have failed to thwart the peasants' fighting spirit in their struggle for their own rights. As of the 19th, 83 peasant leaders had been arrested in the Nicastro district of Catanzaro province. However, the peasants who were expelled from the landlords' fields by the police on the 18th have reoccupied these fields.

On the 18th, a general strike began in Cosenza province to protest the police measures. On the 20th, a call for a general strike was issued in Catanzaro province. Calls for sympathy strikes have also been issued in Arezzo and Florence.

The Secretariat of the Agricultural Workers' Union has issued a statement protesting the mass arrests of peasants, agricultural workers, and their leaders.

　　意农民继续斗争反抗政府镇压行动
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社罗马二十一日讯：据报载，意大利当局对农民运动领袖所采取的镇压手段，并未能挫折农民争取本身权利的斗志。至十九日为止，加坦萨罗省的尼卡斯特罗区已有八十三位农民领袖被捕。但十八日被警察自地主田地中逐出的农民，又重新占据了这些田地。
    十八日，科森查省开始了总罢工，抗议警察措施。二十日，加坦萨罗省发出总罢工的号召。阿雷佐省及佛罗伦萨等地，亦已发出同情罢工的号召。
    农业工人联合会书记处，已发表声明，抗议对农民、农业工人和他们的领袖的大批逮捕。
