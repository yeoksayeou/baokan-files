　　Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Delegation Visits
　　Visiting the National Hui Institute
　　Deeply Moved by the People's Government's Support for Ethnic Minority Cultural and Educational Undertakings
　　[Our Newspaper] The Northwest Ethnic Youth and Women's Delegation visited the National Hui Institute yesterday (the 27th). All teachers, students, and staff of the institute welcomed their brothers and sisters from afar with great excitement. Many students, upon hearing the news that the delegation would visit the school, busied themselves writing slogans and decorating the venue. At noon, students waited inside and outside the school gate, anticipating the arrival of their ethnic brothers and sisters. At 3 PM, the delegation entered the school amidst cheers and applause from the students. After a short rest in the reception room, they began to tour the school's various facilities. During the tour, the delegation members expressed that the fact that there was such a large-scale ethnic minority institution in the capital, only a little over a year after liberation, was sufficient proof of the Central People's Government's care and support for ethnic minority cultural and educational undertakings. At the welcome meeting in the afternoon, Vice President Li Shu of the institute said in his welcoming speech: Under the condition of the country's extreme financial difficulties, the government still does everything possible to help us gradually develop and grow, giving thousands of Hui youth the opportunity to study. This fully demonstrates the People's Government's concern for ethnic minority education and makes us deeply aware that the Chinese Communist Party is the savior of all ethnic groups in China. Shan Yichang, representative of the institute's trade union, and Wang Zhenjia, student representative, unanimously expressed their determination to study hard and go to the Northwest in the future to serve the construction of the Great Northwest. Wang Weiqi, head of the delegation, Shadier, deputy head of the delegation, and members Tuersbieke, Cairang Zhuoma, Ma Zuling, and Tuohuti Bahai spoke successively, unanimously believing that thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, the Northwest has been liberated. The task for the future is for all ethnic groups to unite closely and strive to build a large family of ethnic friendship and cooperation. Head Wang also stated that the Party, government, military, and people of the Northwest welcome the students to work in the Northwest. After the speeches, the delegation performed songs and dances at the request of the students. (National Hui Institute)
