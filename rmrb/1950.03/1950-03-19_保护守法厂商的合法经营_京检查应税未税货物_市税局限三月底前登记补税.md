　　Beijing Inspects Taxable but Unpaid Goods
　　Municipal Tax Bureau Sets Deadline of End of March for Registration and Supplementary Tax Payment
　　[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau has recently decided to launch a vigorous inspection of taxable but unpaid goods in the city, starting immediately, to protect the legal operations of manufacturers who abide by government laws and pay supplementary taxes on schedule, and to prevent tax evasion, thereby safeguarding national fiscal revenue. To this end, the Municipal Tax Bureau hereby reiterates to all manufacturers in the city: Those who have not truthfully declared, registered, and paid supplementary taxes in the past should promptly go to their respective tax sub-bureaus for registration and supplementary tax payment before the end of March. Otherwise, if found after the deadline, it will be treated as tax evasion, and penalties of up to five times the amount of tax evaded will be imposed, or part or all of their goods will be confiscated, in accordance with Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax. Since the Central People's Government promulgated the unified National Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax on February 1st, there have been increases in tax items and changes in tax rates compared to the city's old Goods Tax Regulations. In addition to immediately notifying all subordinate tax collection units to implement it and notifying relevant trade associations to inform merchants to pay taxes according to regulations, the Municipal Tax Bureau, in order to clear inventory and balance the tax burden on new and old goods, also announced on February 8th that all manufacturers, storers, transporters, and vendors of taxable but unpaid goods in the city should uniformly apply to the tax sub-bureaus under their jurisdiction for registration and supplementary tax payment from that date until the end of February, and sales would only be permitted after issuing tax certificates. If there was too much inventory, supplementary taxes could be paid in installments after approval by the sub-bureau. During this period, the Municipal Tax Bureau, led by responsible cadres, separately invited representatives from various trade associations, public and private enterprises, and other relevant units for several discussions to explain the spirit of the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax promulgated by the Central People's Government and fully explained the specific implementation methods: that the tax bureau and various industry associations would combine, unify plans, and handle it together. After this work began, by the end of February, most manufacturers had completed the supplementary tax payment procedures in accordance with regulations. However, there are still many tax evaders. The main problem is that although this registration method basically adopts "automatic declaration and verified supplementary tax payment," the verification work has been done very little due to the limited capacity of tax bureau cadres. In order to overcome this bias, the Municipal Tax Bureau has recently reassigned cadres and is preparing to launch inspection work immediately.

　　保护守法厂商的合法经营
    京检查应税未税货物
    市税局限三月底前登记补税
    【京市新闻处讯】京市税务局顷决定自即日起对本市应税未税货物展开有力检查，以保护遵守政府法令、如期补税厂商的合法经营，并防止漏税，保障国家财政收入。为此，市税务局特再通告本市各厂商：凡过去未依实申报登记补税者，应于三月底以前尽速前往各该管税务分局登记补税，否则，逾期一经查出，即作为漏税论，将按照货物税暂行条例第十二条第二项之规定，处以所漏税额五倍以下之罚金或没收其货物之一部或全部。自中央人民政府二月一日颁布全国统一的货物税暂行条例后，与本市旧有货物税条例比较税目有了增加，税率亦有变更，市税务局除立即转知所属各稽征单位立即遵照实施，及通知各有关同业公会转知各商户照章完税外，并为清理存货，平衡新旧货物纳税负担，曾于二月八日布告周知本市制造存储贩运应税未税货物者，自该日起至二月底止一律各向该管税务分局申请登记补税，发贴证照后方准销售，如存货过多，报经分局核准后可分期补税。在此期间，由负责干部亲自主持，市税务局曾分别邀集各同业公会，各公、私营企业等有关单位代表数度座谈，解释中央人民政府颁布货物税暂行条例的精神，并充分说明了具体执行的办法：是由税务局和各行业公会结合，统一计划，共同办理。此一工作展开后，至二月底止，一般厂商都已按规定办理了补税手续。但漏税户尚属不少，主要症结所在，是此次登记办法虽基本上是采取的“自动申报，核实补税”，但由于税局干部力量关系，核实工作作的很少。为克服此种偏向，市税务局乃于最近调配干部，准备即日开展检查工作。
