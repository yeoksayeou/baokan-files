The Korean People's Anti-Japanese National Liberation Struggle
　　31st Anniversary of the "March 1st" Movement
　　The "March 1st" Movement was an epoch-making movement in the history of the Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle.
　　The Korean people, unable to endure the brutal rule of Japanese imperialism, raised the banner of anti-Japanese patriotism in 1919 amidst the high tide of the world's revolutionary movement and the victory of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution, and the entire nation rose up in a fierce struggle against the rule of Japanese imperialism.
　　On March 1, 1919, the Korean Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Gyeongseong (Seoul), and more than 300,000 people demonstrated, shouting slogans such as "Expel Japanese Imperialism! Establish an independent Korean government!" and "Long live Korean independence!"
　　The movement spread throughout Korea. The Korean people waged a valiant and unyielding struggle under the slaughter and suppression of the Japanese imperialist military police.
　　However, most of the thirty-three so-called leaders who signed the Declaration of Independence at that time compromised and surrendered to the enemy at the beginning of the mass demonstrations. Only the broad masses of the people, centered on the working class, peasants, intellectuals, and students, persistently carried out strikes, class boycotts, market boycotts, demonstrations, and attacked government agencies. This struggle unfolded in 211 of the 218 counties (gun) throughout Korea.
　　Korean people in northeastern China, the Soviet Maritime Territory, Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, San Francisco, and other places abroad also rose up in response to this struggle.
　　The "March 1st" Anti-Japanese Independence Movement persisted for more than three months throughout Korea. More than two million people participated in this struggle. More than 7,900 people were slaughtered by the Japanese imperialists, more than 15,900 were injured, and more than 52,700 were arrested. The "March 1st" Movement was defeated under the brutal suppression of the Japanese imperialists.
　　Most of the leaders of the "March 1st" Movement were religious figures who attempted to achieve Korean independence through petitions. Due to this petty-bourgeois compromise and vacillation, they ultimately succumbed to the enemy.
　　At that time, the Korean proletariat did not yet have its own political party and had not yet become the leading force in the people's struggle, which prevented the "March 1st" Movement from being conducted in a very organized manner. The "March 1st" Movement faced nearly 100,000 Japanese imperialist regular troops and more than 200,000 Japanese imperialist military police. The "March 1st" Movement did not combine the resolution of the land issue with the anti-feudal struggle. It also lacked concrete ties with the world's democratic forces. At this time, the strength of the Japanese proletariat had not yet grown.
　　These were the subjective and objective reasons for the failure of the "March 1st" Movement.
　　However, the "March 1st" Movement is of great significance in the history of the Korean national liberation struggle. Through this movement, the Korean national liberation struggle entered a new stage.
　　Afterward, the Korean national liberation movement was led by the proletariat. The Korean people accepted the lessons of the "March 1st" Movement. In 1925, the Korean Communist Party was founded.
　　The Korean people, in the northern border regions and abroad, launched an anti-Japanese armed struggle in conjunction with the Chinese people. General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, inherited the tradition of the Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle. Today, the Korean People's Army and the guerrillas in the southern half, who have carried forward the tradition of General Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese armed struggle, have formed a powerful force.
　　Reactionary figures such as Syngman Rhee, who abandoned the masses during the "March 1st" Movement, organized the so-called "Korean Provisional Government" in Shanghai. The members of this "government" have consistently done things against the people. Now, in the southern half of Korea, they are colluding with American and Japanese imperialism to carry out the US imperialist colonialization plot, becoming the running dogs of US and Japanese imperialism. Today, as the Korean people commemorate the 31st anniversary of the "March 1st," they are waging a more fervent struggle for the unification and democratization of their homeland.

### 朝鲜人民的反日民族解放斗争  “三、一”运动卅一周年

　　朝鲜人民的反日民族解放斗争
    “三、一”运动卅一周年
    “三、一”运动是朝鲜人民反日民族解放斗争历史上一个划时代的运动。
    在日本帝国主义野蛮统治下不能再忍受的朝鲜人民，在全世界革命运动的高涨与伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命胜利的环境中，于一九一九年举起反日爱国的旗帜，全民族都起来进行了反对日本帝国主义统治的炽烈斗争。
    一九一九年三月一日，在朝鲜京城宣布了朝鲜独立宣言，三十多万的群众进行了示威，并高呼“驱逐日本帝国主义！建立朝鲜独立政府！”“朝鲜独立万岁！”等口号。
    这个运动波及于朝鲜各地。朝鲜人民在日帝宪兵警察的屠杀弹压之下，坚决不屈地进行了英勇的斗争。
    但是，当时在独立宣言书上签字的三十三名所谓指导者，其中的大部分在大众示威开始时就向敌人妥协屈服了。只有以工人阶级、农民、知识分子、学生为中心的广大的人民大众，才坚持地进行了罢工、罢课、罢市、示威游行，并袭击了政府机关。全朝鲜共有二百十八个郡（县），其中有二百十一个郡展开了这个斗争。
    在国外的中国东北、苏联沿海州、东京、北京、上海、旧金山等地的朝鲜人民，都起来响应了这个斗争。
    “三、一”反日独立运动，在全朝鲜坚持了三个多月。有二百多万人参加了这个斗争。被日帝屠杀者有七千九百余人，负伤者一万五千九百余人，有五万二千七百余人被捕。“三、一”运动在日帝的残酷弹压之下遭到了失败。
    “三、一”运动的指导者中的大部分是宗教家，他们企图以请愿的方式取得朝鲜人民的独立。由于这种小资产阶级的妥协动摇性，结果是屈服于敌人了。
    当时的朝鲜无产阶级，还没有自己的政党，还没有成为人民斗争的领导力量，从而使“三、一”运动不能很有组织地进行；“三、一”运动面对着近十万的日帝正规军和二十多万的日帝宪警；“三、一”运动没有结合起土地问题的解决和反封建的斗争；它和全世界的民主力量也没有具体的联系；这时，日本的无产阶级的力量也还没有壮大。
    这些都是“三、一”运动失败的主客观的原因。
    但是，“三、一”运动在朝鲜民族解放斗争史上有很大的意义。经过这个运动，朝鲜民族解放斗争进入了新的阶段。
    以后，朝鲜的民族解放运动即由无产阶级领导。朝鲜人民接受了“三、一”运动的经验教训。在一九二五年，成立了朝鲜共产党。
    朝鲜人民在北部的边境及国外与中国人民联合展开了抗日武装斗争。朝鲜人民的领袖金日成将军继承了朝鲜人民反日民族解放斗争的传统。今天，发扬了金日成将军抗日武装斗争传统的朝鲜人民军和南半部的游击队，已经结成了强大的力量。
    在“三、一”运动当时脱离群众的反动头子李承晚等，在上海组织了所谓“大韩临时政府”，这个“政府”的成员，一贯地做着反人民的事情。现在，他们在朝鲜的南半部勾结美日帝国主义实行美帝的殖民地化阴谋，变成了美日帝国主义的走狗。今天，朝鲜人民纪念“三、一”三十一周年，为自己祖国的统一与民主化展开着更炽烈的斗争。
