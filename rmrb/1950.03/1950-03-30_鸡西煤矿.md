Jixi Coal Mine

　　Question: The People's Daily published a news item on page 3 on March 18th, "Northeast Jixi Coal Mining Area Organizes 5,000 Workers to Study." My classmates and I have never learned about the Jixi Coal Mine in geography class, and we can't find this place on the map. Even the geography teacher doesn't know about it. Could you please tell me: (1) In which province and where in Northeast China is the Jixi Coal Mine located? Is it a new place name? (2) Could you briefly introduce this mine? (Zheng Shijun, Hebei High School)

　　Answer: Jixi is the name of a town located northeast of Linkou County in Songjiang Province. The Jixi coal mining area has four coal mines: Hengshan, Didao, Chengzihe, and Mashan. Its reserves are estimated at approximately 940 million tons. The coal quality is strongly caking, low in phosphorus, and low in sulfur, and is a high-quality coking raw material for ironmaking. The coal mining area is very large, with complete equipment, and in 1948 it already had more than 15,000 employees.

　　鸡西煤矿
    问：三月十八日人民日报第三版刊载了“东北鸡西煤矿区组织五千工人学习”的消息，同学们学习地理都没学过鸡西煤矿这个矿区，在地图上也找不到这个地方，教地理的先生也不知道。请问：（一）鸡西煤矿在东北那一省什么地方？是不是新的地名？（二）请简单介绍此矿。（河北高中郑仕钧）
    答：鸡西是一个镇名，在松江省林口县的东北面。鸡西煤矿区共有四个煤矿：恒山、滴道、城子河、麻山。其埋藏量估计约为九·四亿吨，煤质都是属于强粘结性、低磷、低硫磺的高度沥青煤，是很好的制铁用炼焦原料煤。该煤矿区面积很大，设备完善，在一九四八年时即有职工一万五千余人。
