　　In the labor movement and the peace movement
　　Italian Communist Party Grows Stronger
　　Membership Reaches 2,360,000
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 18th] Electric News Agency, Rome: The Italian Communist Party issued a communique on the 8th stating that as of the end of February, the total number of Italian Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members has reached 2,359,642, of which there are 393,154 Communist Youth League members. This indicates that the number of party members has greatly increased compared to the party's survey last year.
　　(Note: On June 30th last year, Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary Xie Jia reported that the number of party members totaled 2,242,719.) The registration of party members and the recruitment of new party members is still ongoing.
　　Last year's party member registration took seven to eight months, but this year's registration only took two months. The communique pointed out that this not only demonstrates the strengthening of unity and organizational strength, but also the expansion of the Communist Party's political influence throughout Italy. This achievement was obtained from the broad workers' movement and the party's own efforts to strive for peace, defend democratic freedom, and protect the lives of the people in the national movement.

　　在工运与和平运动中
    意共日趋壮大
    党团员增达二百三十六万
    【新华社十八日讯】电通社罗马讯：意大利共产党八日发表公报称：截至二月底为止，意大利共产党及共产主义青年团党团员总数，已达二百三十五万九千六百四十二人，其中共产主义青年团团员计三十九万三千一百五十四人。此点表明党团员人数，比较去年党的调查，已有大量的增加。
    （按：去年六月三十日意共副书记谢嘉报告，党团员人数共为二百二十四万二千七百十九人。）党团员登记及新党团员的吸收，仍在继续中。
    去年党员登记，需时七个月至八个月，今年登记仅费时两月。公报指出：这不仅表明团结及组织力量的增强，也表明共产党在全意大利的政治影响的扩大。这种成果是从广大的工人运动中，及党本身致力于争取和平、保卫民主自由及人民生命的全国性运动中所获得的。
