Cuba Today
By Sazayev
Translated by Xin Nan

What greets a traveler arriving in Havana from the sea is the tall palm trees surrounding the Presidential Palace and the luxurious hotels and restaurants on the wide embankment with its bustling traffic. Upon reaching the port, the traveler will find a bustling city with crowds of people, mostly dressed in white, speaking fluent Spanish.

The old, cramped trams and minibuses of Havana are plastered from end to end with advertisements for American drinks. American advertisements are everywhere, as are the signs of American companies and American trust banks, as well as brightly colored American movie advertisements. Newsstands display more American newspapers and magazines than local publications. When buying things, the shop assistant will ask if you want your change in Cuban currency or US dollars, because US dollars are circulating at par with the Cuban peso (Cuban currency). The peso bills even look like American dollars, and they are printed in the United States along with other Cuban banknotes.

※ ※ ※

Greater Havana boasts a population of nearly one million. However, the bustling city center is not large. It is mainly limited to the streets surrounding the small Central Park, from which the tree-lined main thoroughfare, Prado Avenue, extends towards the sea. In Central Park stands the statue of José Martí, the fighter for Cuban independence. Nearby is the Capitol Building, which is actually a replica of its older brother, the US Capitol Building in Washington. Opposite the Capitol are shops, cinemas, and sidewalk cafes – where Cuban dancers famous for their nudity perform in the evenings for American tourists and local idle rich who come here to relax after enduring the heat of the day.

On the main commercial thoroughfare, Galiano Street, Cuban stores are becoming invisible among so many American, Spanish, and British companies. American goods dominate: American imports flood the local market, and Cuba's fragile national industry cannot compete with them. American companies and trust banks operate in Cuba in much the same way as they do in an American colony. They clearly feel that being in Cuba is a matter of course. American businessmen have built luxurious villas here – most of which can be seen in the wealthy residential areas of Vedado and Miramar in Havana. Americans have their own banks, newspapers, radio stations, schools, clubs, and churches. Billionaire DuPont even has his own airport on his own property in the fashionable Varadero resort.

Cuban life revolves around the sugar industry, which employs about 500,000 workers, roughly one-third of the salaried population. And sugar seems to be the main subject of congressional speeches, broadcasts, and news headlines. The sugar harvest, how much the United States buys, and the outcome of strikes in the sugar refining industry are all top priorities here.

The sugar industry suffocates all other agricultural sectors. Cuba took advantage of favorable market conditions to double its sugar production between 1939 and 1948, rising to the top position in sugar production in the capitalist world. In 1948, production exceeded six million tons. As much as 95 percent of Cuban sugar was shipped to the United States. However, this sugar was not all consumed in the United States; most of it was resold to Marshall Plan countries in Europe and Asia at exorbitant prices by cunning American speculators.

American capitalists control Cuba's sugar industry – they account for 60 percent of total investment, with the remaining 40 percent held by Spanish, Canadian, and local investors. The Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company, West Indies Sugar Corporation, United Fruit Company, and other American firms own vast sugar mills and plantations on the island.

One of Cuba's largest sugar mills belongs to the American Hershey Corporation. Hershey's estate is reminiscent of an ancient feudal kingdom. This company is particularly free from the constraints of the Cuban authorities. It runs its own hotels, its own shops, power plants, hundreds of kilometers of electric trains, and its own docks in Havana and Matanzas.

The Hershey Corporation not only owns countless sugarcane and ramie plantations, but also has tens of thousands of tenant farmers growing sugarcane for it, as well as a dozen or so small refineries, similarly under its control. The company is like a giant octopus, its tentacles stretching far and wide along the coast of the island and deep into the interior. The entire Cuban sugar industry, like its fertile land, is in the hands of about fifteen companies similar to Hershey.

The plunder of Cuban land and the brutal exploitation of its cheap labor have earned the sugar trusts huge profits. The Cuban Falls Sugar Company made a net profit of five million pesos in 1949 – a dividend of 30.8 percent per share.

The rule of foreign trusts and their Cuban subsidiaries has made it impossible for this country with fertile land, a favorable climate, a population of five million, and an area larger than Hungary to be self-sufficient, and it must import large quantities of flour, rice and other grains, meat, oil, canned food, and even dried fruit from the United States.

Cuba's rich mineral deposits of iron, copper, manganese, oil, and chromium remain untouched, with only a small portion being mined by American companies. The mining of manganese and chromium, which began during the war, has virtually stopped, and the production of copper and iron has also been greatly reduced. The reason is that Cuba has been assigned the role of a purely agricultural appendage in the American economic system.

※ ※ ※

The narrow one-way streets of old Havana are lined with one- and two-story buildings built long ago. These are the homes of the poor, with eight or nine people crammed into small, dark, unfurnished rooms that often lack basic sanitation. Sunshine and ventilation are out of the question in these houses; and the tropical heat exacerbates the effects of filth, dust, and crowding.

The people in the outskirts of the capital live in filthy shacks pieced together from plywood and thin sheets of iron, with roofs of sugarcane and thatch. The autumn hurricanes force the residents of these places to seek shelter behind stone walls – in cemeteries or anywhere they can find shelter. The hurricanes routinely sweep away these miserable dwellings one by one.

But in any case, many Havana citizens are homeless. Public Works Minister Valdés has said that there are 100,000 homeless people in the capital alone, and it goes without saying that he is not exaggerating. The Daily News of February 20, 1949, published a photograph of an old man named Flores living in a ventilation shaft.

The fate of the sugarcane workers is truly miserable. His dwelling is a small shack crudely made of sugarcane and thatch, with no furniture on the dirt floor, and filthy and crowded beyond belief. The worker's daily wage is only 0.8 to 1.5 pesos, not enough to support a worker, let alone his family. It must be remembered that work in the sugarcane fields and sugar refineries is seasonal, only four months of work a year. The rest of the time, the worker must rely on the money he earned during the work season to make a living.

Many people living in the city rely on occasional income – selling lottery tickets or running errands for travelers and local wealthy people. Many have to beg in the streets. As soon as a well-dressed person appears on the street, he will be surrounded by a group of ragged children begging for a "querido," a penny.

The American economic crisis has also dragged Cuba into it, because the island is completely dependent on the American economy. The outlook is for increased unemployment and greater poverty and hunger. President Socarrás' economic review last autumn presented a very bleak picture:

"Since I took office twelve months ago," the President said, "a period of economic recession has begun throughout the world. This cannot but also affect Cuba... We are now undergoing an economic crisis... The following statistics illustrate our economic situation: In the first eight months of 1948, bank turnover decreased by 62 million US dollars compared to the same period in 1947, and the value of exports decreased by 77 million US dollars during this period. In 1949, we produced one million tons less sugar, eight thousand tons less coffee, seven thousand tons less tobacco, and fifty-four million gallons less alcohol than in the previous year."

From these dismal figures, we can also assert that, in addition to what the President listed, the economic crisis has penetrated other industries. Textile and jute manufacturing plants are closing down one by one because they cannot compete with the United States. The production of leather goods and building materials has also shrunk.

Cuba's ruling group is seeking a way out by further depressing the living standards of the working people and massively laying off government employees. Bourgeois politicians have offered many dubious prescriptions for resolving the crisis. One of them is to build a city exclusively for tourism, dig a tunnel, and build things to attract American tourists, in order to expand the tourism business. The government greatly appreciates this plan and has announced that the construction costs will require a debt of 200 million US dollars. The Cuban parliament then passed the loan proposal despite strong protests from democratic groups, and the government negotiated a loan with American banks. Prior to this, Cuba already owed the United States more than 167 million US dollars in debt.

Bandits are rampant throughout Cuba. Reports of robbery, murder, and rape appear in the newspapers every day. Armed conflicts are not limited to the police and bandits. On one occasion, two groups of opposing police forces lined up and fought in the streets of Marianao, not far from Havana; the fighting lasted for about an hour until army tank units intervened.

The reactionaries use bandit gangs to deal with political opponents, especially to murder progressive leaders. With the help of assassins, several leaders of the Progressive Cuban Workers' Confederation were assassinated. Official reprisals were also rained down on the Workers' Confederation and the Cuban People's Socialist Party (i.e., the Cuban Communist Party – translator's note). In May 1948, the authorities confiscated the party's Mil Diez radio station. The party's houses throughout the country were systematically looted and destroyed. In 1948, fabricated charges that the party's leaders were "conspiring to undermine the republic" were brought before the Supreme Court.

The authorities have often used police tactics to eliminate progressive trade unions. This is the usual procedure: a team of police with rifles and machine guns rushes into the union's house, "confiscates" its funds and property, and arrests or simply drives out the union officials; the responsible police officer then appoints some carefully selected government personnel to form a "new leadership." Then comes an announcement that the union in question has "joined" a government-backed yellow union. This is what happened to the bus ticket workers' union, the tobacco workers' union, and several other unions.

Collective strikes are the workers' response to these autocratic actions. Thousands of strikers have been thrown into prison, but nothing can break the resistance of the Cuban working class, who are responding to division, assassination, and looting by uniting more solidly around the Workers' Confederation and the People's Socialist Party.

More than 150,000 people attended the funeral of Jesús Menéndez, the leader of the sugar workers' union, who was killed by a military officer in January 1948. Dockworkers responded to the assassination of their leader, Arcesio Iglesias, with a collective strike. We saw Iglesias' funeral: tens of thousands of men and women marched forward in angry silence, carrying banners calling for the establishment of self-defense forces. Not a single policeman dared to enter the cemetery.

The rulers of Cuba, accepting the instructions of American imperialists, have also joined the movement to incite war. Bourgeois scribes clamor day and night that a third world war is inevitable and tell simple-minded people that the United States is guaranteed to win quickly. They do everything they can to tout the military and economic power of the United States and try to make people feel that Cuba must make itself completely subordinate to its "powerful northern neighbor."

American militarists support this propaganda by staging regular naval exercises on the Cuban coast. Last spring, a US fleet consisting of an aircraft carrier and several other ships visited Havana. The naval exercises were actually held within a stone's throw of the embankment and were held under the police's compulsion for people to watch. American planes roaring their engines flew low over the streets of Havana.

However, this demonstration of American power brought disaster. On the evening of March 11, several drunken American sailors went to Central Park, where one of them climbed onto the Martí Monument and insulted the statue of the Cuban national hero. An outraged crowd rose up to attack the scoundrel, and only the police's intervention, sheltering the American rogue in the police station, allowed him to escape the angry blows. The next morning, the fleet hastily left Cuban waters.

The anger caused by the American sailors shook the country. Demonstrations marched towards the American Embassy, and the embassy's windows were stoned. Outraged citizens gathered everywhere, demanding that the American sailors be tried in Cuban courts. The expression of anti-American hatred was so strong that Americans dared not show their faces on the street after this incident. The American ambassador laid a wreath at the foot of the Martí Monument in an attempt to alleviate public anger. But as soon as the embassy staff left, the gathered Cubans immediately destroyed his wreath and replaced it with one of their own. For an entire month, the monument was decorated with flowers; dozens of delegations went there to serve as a guard of honor. This was indeed a vivid mass demonstration against American imperialism.

A broad peace movement against the warmongers' propaganda has been launched in Cuba, uniting all the progressive democratic forces in the country: the People's Socialist Party, trade unions, student unions, the Cuban Democratic Women's Federation, and various other groups, as well as social figures and scientists. From one end of the island to the other, from Santiago de Cuba in eastern Cuba to Pinar del Río in the west, local peace committees have been established and conferences of peace advocates have been held.

On July 6, 1949, the National Peace Conference, attended by more than 2,000 delegates from all over the island, was held in Havana. The conference was convened by the famous Cuban scientist Fernando Ortiz. Dozens of speakers representing many different organizations voiced the people's firm determination to fight the warmongers and to strive for peace, freedom, and national independence. The conference elected a permanent National Peace Committee. The Cuban people are now fighting for peace and democracy, against imperialism and against Cuba's subservience to Wall Street's monopoly capitalists.

　　今日古巴
    萨节耶夫作  新南译
    古巴京城呈现于一个刚从海上抵达哈瓦拿的旅客眼前的是那环绕着总统府的高大的棕榈树，和那汽车往来络绎的宽阔堤岸上的豪华的旅馆和饭店。到达口岸时，旅客就会发现这是一个闹市，成群的人们，多半穿着白色衣服，操着流畅的西班牙语。
    哈瓦拿的古旧的过小的电车上和小公共汽车上，从头到尾都贴满了美国饮料的宣传广告。美国的广告到处触目皆是，到处是美国公司和美国信托银行的招牌，以及鲜艳耀眼的美国电影广告。报摊上放的美国报章杂志要较当地出版的为多。买东西时，店员会问你的找头是要古巴币呢，还是要美金，因为美金是按与古巴比索（古币）的等值票面流通的。比索券甚至看起来像是美钞，而且，它是和其它古巴钞票一道在美国印制的。
    ※      ※      ※
    大哈瓦拿城夸耀有将近一百万的人口。然而繁华的市中心区并不算大。它主要限于环绕在小不堪言的中央公园四周的街道，两旁高树成荫的主要通衢——普拉多大道便从那儿向海边伸展。中央公园中竖着古巴独立的斗士——约瑟·玛蒂的雕像。附近是国会大厦，实际上这是它的老兄——华盛顿的美国国会大厦的复制品。在国会对面的是商店、影戏院和路边咖啡馆——以裸体著名的古巴舞女们，晚间就在这儿为那些白天受了炎热之苦来到这儿舒散的美国旅客和当地的游手好闲的富豪们献舞。
    在主要的商业通衢加兰诺街上，在那么多的美国、西班牙和英国的公司之间，古巴人的商店都快看不见了。美国货物占着上风：美国的入口货充溢着当地的市场，古巴的脆弱的民族工业无法和它竞争。美国公司和信托银行在古巴所干的勾当和它们在一个美国的殖民地里所干的并无二致。显然地它们觉得设在古巴是理所当为。美国商人在这儿建造了豪华的别墅——其中多半可以在哈瓦拿的富人住宅区维达多和米拉马那里看到。美国人有他们自己的银行，自己的报纸、广播电台、学校、俱乐部和教堂。亿万富翁杜邦甚至在时新的瓦拉德洛避暑地他自己的产业那里，有他自己的一个飞机场。
    古巴的生活以制糖业为重心，受雇于该业的工人约五十万，大概占有薪金人口的三分之一。而食糖似乎也成了国会演说、广播以及新闻标题的主要题材之一。食糖的收成如何，美国购买多少，食糖炼制业罢工的结果如何，这一切都是这儿头等重要的问题。
    制糖业窒息了其它一切农业部门。古巴利用有利的市场条件使食糖产量在一九三九至一九四八年间增加了一倍而升居资本主义世界中糖产的第一位。一九四八年产量超过了六百万吨。输往美国的古巴糖竟达总产量的百分之九十五之多。然而这些糖并不是全部都在美国消费，大部分是被狡猾的美国投机商人以超额的价格转销给欧洲和亚洲的马歇尔化国家去了。
    美国的资本家们控制着古巴的糖业——他们占有了全部投资的百分之六十，其余的百分之四十分别为西班牙、加拿大及本地的投资。古巴大西洋糖业公司、西印度糖业公司、联合果糖公司及其他美国商号在岛上拥有庞大的炼糖厂和种植园。
    古巴几个最大的炼糖厂中的一个，是属于美国赫西股份公司的。赫西的产业，令人想起古代的封建王国。这个公司特别显著地不受古巴当局的约束。它开办着自己的旅馆，它自己的商店、电力厂、长达数百公里的电力火车，以及它自己在哈瓦拿和玛当萨斯的码头。
    赫西股份公司不但拥有无数甘蔗和苎麻种植园，而且有成万佃农为它种植甘蔗，还有一打左右的小制炼厂，同样地受着它的控制，这个公司像个大章鱼，它的触须广远地伸展在岛屿的沿岸，它并伸入内地的深处。整个古巴的糖业，一如她肥沃的土地，是掌握在约十五个类似赫西的公司手中的。
    对古巴土地的掠夺，对她的廉价劳动力野蛮的剥削，使糖业托拉斯们获得了巨额利润，古巴瀑布糖业公司在一九四九年就净赚了五百万比索——即每股分得百分之三○·八的利润。
    外国托拉斯和它们在古巴的附属公司统治的结果，使这个土地肥沃、气候良好、有人口五百万而面积大于匈牙利的国家无法自给而必需从美国输入大量面粉、米和其他谷物、肉、油、罐头食物，甚至于干果。
    古巴丰富的矿藏，铁、铜、锰、油及铬仍然原封未动，只有极小部分由美国公司在开采。在战时开始采掘的锰和铬，实际上已经停顿，而铜和铁的生产量也大大减少了。理由就是古巴已经被派担任美国经济体系中单纯农业附庸的角色。
        ※    ※    ※
    旧哈瓦拿城狭窄的单行道的两旁，是很久以前所建造的一、二层的楼房。这些就是穷人的住家，八、九个人挤在一间又小又黑缺乏家具甚至往往还没有基本的卫生设备的屋子里，阳光和通风设备在这些房子是谈不到的；而热带的炎热更加恶化了污秽、尘土和拥挤的影响。
    京城近郊的人民，住在用三夹板与薄铁片拼凑而成、并以甘蔗和茅草做屋顶的龌龊的棚户中。秋季的飓风迫使这些地方的居民不得不在石墙后面寻找住所——在公墓中或任何可能找到遮蔽的地方。飓风照例要一幢一幢地卷走这类可怜的住屋。
    但是无论如何，许多哈瓦拿市民还是无家可归的。公共工程部长瓦尔戴斯曾说过，仅仅在京城中即有十万人无家可归，不用说，他绝不会言过其实的。一九四九年二月二十日的《每日新闻》曾经刊载过一个住在通风洞里的，名叫弗劳瑞斯的老人的照片。
    甘蔗园工人的运命实在是够苦的。他的住所是一个由甘蔗和茅草所粗制滥造的小屋，泥土地上什么家具也没有，肮脏拥挤得不堪。工人每日工资所得不过从○·八到一·五比索，不够养活一个工人，更不用说到他的家庭了。必须记住的是甘蔗园与炼糖厂的工作都是季节性的，一年中只有四个月的工作。其余的时候，工人只得依赖他在工作季节里所赚得的钱来糊口了。
    许多住在城市里的人依靠偶尔的收入——出售彩票或者给游历者和地方富绅们当当跑腿。许多人只好在街头讨饭。只要有一个服饰整洁的人出现在街上，他一定会被一群衣着破烂的孩子包围起来，乞求给他一个“奎里多”，一个便士。
    美国的经济危机也同样地将古巴卷进去，因为这个小岛完全依附于美国经济之下。前景是失业增加和更大的贫困与饥饿。索卡拉斯总统去年秋天所作的经济考察报告中呈现出一幅极为黯淡的景象：
    “自我在十二个月以前就职以来，”总统说“全世界都开始了经济萧条的时期。这就不能不也影响到古巴……我们现在正在经受着一个经济危机……下述的统计可以说明我们的经济情况：在一九四八年前八个月中，银行周转额较一九四七年同期减少六千二百万美元，出口货值在此时期降低七千七百万美元。一九四九年我们比上一年少生产一百万吨糖，八千吨咖啡，七千吨烟草和五千四百万加仑的酒精。”
    从这些令人沮丧的数字看来，我们还可断言除了总统所列举的外，经济危机已侵入了其他的工业。纺织与麻纤维制造厂因无法与美国竞争而逐个倒闭。皮革制品与建筑材料的产量也同样地萎缩了。
    古巴的统治集团以进一步压低劳动人民生活水平并大量解雇机关职员来寻求出路。资产阶级的政客们开出了许多令人怀疑的解救危机的丹方。其中之一是建立一个专供游览的城市，掘一条隧道，并且建筑一些吸引美国游客的东西，以扩展游览生意。政府颇为赏识这个计划，并且宣布，开工费用需要二亿美元的债款。于是古巴议会就不顾民主集团的强烈抗议，通过了贷款的建议，而政府就和美国银行谈判起借款了。在此之前古巴已欠美国一亿六千七百万美元以上之债款。
    古巴的盗匪横行各地。抢劫、谋杀和强奸的报导每天都在报上出现。武装冲突还不只限于警察和土匪之间。有一次两批敌对的警察集团在距哈瓦拿不远的玛瑞阿那欧城的大街上就列阵打起仗来；打了约有一小时直到陆军坦克队来干涉时才停止。
    反动派应用盗匪群来对付政敌，特别是用来谋害进步的领袖。由于刺客的协助，进步的古巴工人联合会的几个领袖被刺死了。官方的报复行动也如疾风骤雨似地用来对付工人联合会和古巴人民社会党（即古巴共产党——译注）。一九四八年五月，当局没收了该党密尔的爱斯广播电台。该党在各地的房屋被有计划地掠夺着和破坏着。一九四八年时，捏造该党领袖“阴谋破坏共和国”的控诉被提到了最高法院。
    当局曾经常地以警察手段的行动来消灭进步的工会。这就是惯常的步骤：一队警察带着来福枪和机枪冲进工会的房屋，“没收”其基金和财产，并且把工会职员逮捕或者干脆把他们赶出去；负责的警官然后指派一些仔细挑选出来的政府人员组成“新的领导”。随后就是一篇通告说这个发生问题的工会已经“加入”政府支持的黄色工会。这就是公共汽车售票员工会、烟草工人工会以及几个别的工会所遭遇的事件。
    集体罢工是工会对这些专制行为的回答。成千的罢工者被抓进监狱，但是什么也破坏不了古巴工人阶级的反抗，他们以更巩固地团结在工人联合会和人民社会党的周围来回答分裂、暗杀和掳掠。
    有十五万以上的人参加了制糖业工会领袖海索斯·梅南得斯的葬礼，他是在一九四八年一月被一个军官杀死的。码头工人以集体罢工的行动来回答他们的领袖阿瑞西利欧·依格雷西阿斯的被刺。我们看到了依格雷西阿斯的葬礼：几万男女的行列在愤怒的静默中向前行进着，带着标语号召成立自卫队。没有一个警察胆敢进入墓地去。
    古巴的统治者们接受美帝国主义者的指示，他们也加入了煽动战争的运动。资产阶级的文棍们一天到晚叫嚣第三次世界大战是不可避免的，并且告诉头脑简单的人们说可以保证美国会很快的胜利。他们尽其所能地鼓吹美国的军事和经济的力量并且试图使人们感觉古巴必需使她自己完全服从于她的“强大的北方邻国”。
    美国军国主义者在古巴的海面布置定期的海军演习来支持这种宣传。去年春天，一队由一艘航空母舰及几艘其他舰艇组成的美国舰队访问了哈瓦拿。海军演习实际上是在距堤岸不过一石之处，并且在警察迫使人们去看之情况下举行的。引擎怒吼着的美国飞机在哈瓦拿街道上低空掠过。
    然而，这种美国力量的示威带来了灾难。三月十一日的傍晚，几个酩酊大醉的美国水兵去逛中央公园，其中一个爬上了玛蒂纪念碑进行侮辱古巴民族英雄的雕像。激愤的群众起来袭击无赖汉，只是靠了警察的阻挡，把美国流氓掩护在警察局里才使他们逃过了那些愤慨的捶击。第二天黎明，舰队匆促地离开古巴海面。
    美国水兵所引起的愤怒震动全国。示威游行走向美国大使馆，使馆的窗子挨了石击。愤激的市民在各处集会，要求美国水兵应受古巴法庭的审判。对于美帝仇恨的表现是如此强烈，以致这事发生以后美国人都不敢在街上露面了。美国大使在玛蒂纪念碑脚下放上一个花圈力求减轻公众的忿怒。但当大使馆人员刚刚走开，聚集的古巴人立即毁坏了他的花圈，换上了他们自己的一个。整整一个月，纪念碑被鲜花装饰着；几十个代表团到那里充当护卫的仪仗队。这的确是一个生动的群众性的抗议美帝的示威。
    反对战争贩子宣传的广泛的和平运动在古巴已经开展起来，所有国内进步的民主力量都团结在这个运动当中：人民社会党、工会、学联、古巴民主妇联以及各种其他团体，还有社会名流和科学人士。从岛屿的一端到另外一端，从古巴东部的圣地安哥到西部的彭纳德里约，各地的地方和平委员会已经成立，拥护和平者的会议已经召开。
    一九四九年七月六日，有来自岛上各地的二千余代表出席的全国和平大会在哈瓦拿举行了。大会由著名的古巴科学家费兰多·奥蒂兹召开。代表着许多不同组织的几十位发言人，发出了人民坚决与战争贩子战斗和争取和平、自由、民族独立的呼声。大会选举了永久的全国和平委员会。古巴人民现在正为着争取和平民主，为着反对帝国主义和反对古巴屈从于华尔街的独占资本家而战斗。
