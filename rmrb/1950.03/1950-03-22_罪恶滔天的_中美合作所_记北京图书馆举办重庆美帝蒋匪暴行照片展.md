The Heinous Crimes of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization"
    A Record of the Photo Exhibition of American Imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Atrocities in Chongqing, Held at the Beijing Library
    Mu Yang
    In late November 1949, as the iron fist of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was about to fall on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Chongqing, these conscienceless bandits carried out a brutal mass slaughter of hundreds of revolutionary martyrs in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" concentration camp on Gele Mountain, creating a blood debt that the Chinese people can never forget and must be repaid.
    The full name of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" is the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperative Organization." In early May 1942, Chiang Kai-shek's top secret agent, Dai Li, invited Naval Major General Miles, a secret agent from his American masters, to jointly "collect intelligence" and plan the formation of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization." In April 1943, after Dai Li obtained radio equipment, weapons, instruments of torture, and a large number of personnel and technical equipment from the United States through Miles, this "cooperative" organization was formally established. From then on, the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," located on Gele Mountain west of Chongqing city, weighed heavily on the people of Chongqing and all of China, just like the place where it was situated.
    Gele Mountain is more than 20 li from the city. Within this 30-li "special zone," there were about 20 large and small dens of devils. Here, tens of thousands of revolutionary martyrs were imprisoned, persecuted, and massacred.
    Every entrance and every road here was densely packed with sentries, guard posts, and warning bells. The warning bells rang every ten minutes, warning the lackeys "guarding" the dens of devils to strictly prevent revolutionaries from escaping. Every night, when this howling sound rang out, the devil's area became even more sinister and terrifying. Therefore, from the first day that this group of jackals occupied this place, for ten years, nearby residents dared not go out after sunset.
    But finally, in the winter of last year, the steel fist of the People's Liberation Army reached the gates of Chongqing. The bandits, on the verge of collapse, raised their bloody knives against these unarmed prisoners!
    At 4:00 p.m. on November 27, the massacre began in the Bai Gongguan devil's den. Groups of fellow prisoners were escorted out. Everyone walked to the execution ground heroically shouting slogans such as "Long live the People's Republic of China," "Long live the Communist Party," and "Long live Chairman Mao," and reciting poems. The fellow prisoners waiting to be executed sang the March of the Volunteers loudly. The songs and slogans fought against the criminal gunshots until midnight. The massacres in Zha Zi Dong and other places were also carried out under the same plan. The bandits in Zha Zi Dong were even more afraid of the rapid arrival of the People's Liberation Army and carried out mass slaughters with machine guns and carbines. The bandits committed heinous crimes in this way and then fled in panic.
    The day before yesterday, the reporter walked into the exhibition room of American and Chiang Kai-shek atrocities in the Beijing Library. The photos taken on the spot deeply pained the hearts of every visitor. The room was full of viewers, but not a sound could be heard. Many people had tears in their eyes and were taking notes of this blood debt.
    This is the Dai Li Shrine: here, two large pits were unearthed, burying the bodies of more than 60 martyrs. The bodies were stacked haphazardly in the pits. Many of the martyrs were bound with their hands behind their backs and had shackles on their feet. As they dug deeper, every shovel and hoe brought up the decayed flesh of the martyrs. In one photo, a young woman was crying for her dead husband. She was a student at the Women's Normal College and had only been married for a week when her husband was arrested. Here, a deceased couple and two young children were photographed. The couple had been arrested for several years, the older child was two and a half years old, and the younger one was only nine months old. These two young lives had not even lived a day of freedom before they were killed! Let every father and mother remember! The inhuman bandits slaughtered the people in this way, "uprooting the weeds." General Yang Hucheng's body was also exhumed in Dai Li's garden, with his arms still tied behind his back.
    Zha Zi Dong, this is a terrible name, an even more sinister place. A not-very-large courtyard, surrounded by high mountains on three sides. This is the place where General Ye Ting and Comrade Liao Chengzhi were imprisoned. Now, all the houses have been burned down. Many martyrs were burned into charcoal in these houses, which were set on fire with gasoline. Several who jumped out of the fire were also shot dead by the bandits in the courtyard.
    In the "building site," Chiang Kai-shek built a canteen that could accommodate a thousand people for countless American special agents, and a dance hall was built nearby, specifically for the American special agents to indulge in extravagance and lewdness. The "Mei Garden" of the American special agent chief Miles was also not far from here. This group of American special agents "cooperated" with the Chiang Kai-shek gang in the "cause" of slaughtering the Chinese people here. They trained 1,800 butchers – special agents – for Chiang Kai-shek here.
    In order to treat his "distinguished guests" well, Dai Li once used "the most beautiful and best-dressed Chinese women to serve the Americans," and this group of "Americans" could also use Dai Li's "power" to go to "any place" to carry out special agent activities, and could get the "various help" and preferential treatment of the Chiang Kai-shek special agents. This massacre was a concentrated manifestation of this "cooperation."
    Look, American-made guns and ammunition are everywhere, and American-made instruments of torture and execution equipment are everywhere. The words "Made in USA" are clearly cast on piles of electric torture equipment. Even more glaringly, the words "Made by American Handcuff Company" are cast on the handcuffs.
    Seeing this, every visitor cannot help but miss the people in Tibet, Taiwan, and Hainan Island, who are still groaning under the knives and shackles of American and Chiang Kai-shek special agent bandits to this day! We must vow to liberate them. As I recorded this blood debt and approached the exit of the exhibition room, I saw a comrade writing such a determination in the guestbook: "I am determined to study hard, work harder, and buy more public bonds, in order to quickly eliminate the remaining bandits!" This represents the determination of the Chinese people to avenge the dead martyrs and fight for the justice of mankind!

　　罪恶滔天的“中美合作所”
    记北京图书馆举办重庆美帝蒋匪暴行照片展
    穆扬
    一九四九年的十一月下旬，当中国人民解放军的铁拳即将落在重庆蒋匪帮的头上时，这群丧尽天良的匪徒们曾在歌乐山“中美合作所”这座全国最大的集中营里，对数百名革命志士进行了惨酷的集体屠杀，造成了中国人民永不能忘而必须索还的大血债。
    “中美合作所”的全名是“中美特种技术合作所”。一九四二年五月初由蒋匪帮最大的特务头子戴笠，从他的美国主子那里请来了海军少将特务头子梅罗士（或译迈尔斯），与他共同“搜集情报”，筹划合组“中美合作所”。一九四三年四月，当戴匪通过梅罗士从美国获得了无线电、武器、刑具以及大批的人员和技术装备后，这个“合作”机构就正式成立了。从此，这个座落在重庆城西歌乐山上的“中美合作所”，就像它所处的地方一样，高高地而且沉重地压在重庆人民以及全中国人民的头上。
    歌乐山离城二十多里，在这周围三十多里的“特区”里，有着大大小小二十来个魔窟。在这里，上万的革命志士曾被他们囚禁过，并遭受了残害和屠杀。
    这里的每个入口、每条道路，都密布着哨兵、岗亭和警钟。警钟每隔十分钟敲一次，警告“警卫”着魔窟的喽罗们，严防革命者越狱。每当黑夜，这种嗥叫的声浪响起时，魔窟区就变得更阴森和更恐怖。因此，从这群豺狼盘据在这里的第一天起，十年来，近地居民每当日没西山时就紧锁大门不敢外出了。
    但是，终于在去年的冬天，人民解放军的钢拳伸近了重庆的大门。濒于末日的匪徒们也就对这些手无寸铁的被囚禁者挥起了血腥的屠刀！
    十一月二十七日下午四点，魔窟白公馆中的大屠杀开始了。难友们一批批地被押出去。大家壮烈地高呼着“中华人民共和国万岁”、“共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”的口号，朗颂着诗篇走上了刑场。待处决的难友们高声地唱着义勇军进行曲。歌声、口号同罪恶的枪声一直搏斗到午夜。渣滓洞等地的屠杀也在同一的计划下进行。渣滓洞的匪徒们更害怕解放军的神速到达，用机枪和卡宾枪进行了集体屠杀。匪徒们就这样做了滔天罪行之后：狼狈逃窜。
    前天，记者走进了北京图书馆的美蒋暴行展览室。这里陈列着的实地摄取的照片，深深地刺痛着每个参观者的心。满屋子的观众，听不到一点声音。许多人眼里含着泪水，拿着本子在记录着这笔血债。
    这是戴匪祠：在这里发掘出来了埋着六十多个烈士尸身的两个大坑。尸身在坑内横七竖八地堆叠着。许多殉难者都被反绑着，带着脚镣。挖到深处，每一铲每一锄都带起了烈士们糜烂了的皮肉。一张照片上，一个年轻的女人在哭她的死去的丈夫。她是女师学院的学生，结婚才一星期，丈夫就被捕了。这里拍摄着一对死去的夫妇和两个幼孩。这对夫妇已经被捕几年了，大孩子两岁半，小的才九个月。这两个幼小的生命都还没有过过一天自由的日子就被杀害了！让每个作父亲和作母亲的记住吧！毫无人性的匪徒们就是这样“斩草除根”地屠杀人民的。杨虎城将军的尸身也在戴匪的花园里被发掘出来，双臂还被反绑着。
    渣滓洞，这是一个可怕的名子，一个更阴森的地方。一座不很大的院落，三面被高山包围着。这是曾囚禁过叶挺将军和廖承志同志的地方。现在全部房屋已被焚毁。许许多多的志士们就在这座用汽油焚烧着的房子里被烧成黑炭。几个从火里跳出来的，也被匪徒们枪杀在院子里。
    在“造时场”，蒋匪为无数的美特建造了可容千人的食堂，并于附近建立了舞厅，专供美特们饕餮荒淫之用。美特头子梅罗士的“梅园”也离此不远。这群美国特务们就在这里与蒋匪帮们“合作”着屠杀中国人民的“事业”。他们在这里为蒋匪训练了一千八百个屠手——特务。
    戴匪为了优待他的“贵宾”，曾用“长的最漂亮和穿的最好的中国女子侍候美国人”，而这群“美国人”还可以凭着戴匪的“权力”到“无论什么地方去”进行特务活动，并可以得到蒋特的“各种帮助”和优待。这次的大屠杀就是这种“合作”的集中表现。
    看吧，遍地是美造枪、弹，遍地是美造刑具和行刑器材。一堆堆的电刑器材上都清晰地铸刻着英文“美国造”的字样。在手铐上更刺目地铸刻着“美国无比手铐公司出品”的字样。
    看到这里，不禁使我们每一个参观者怀念起西藏、台湾和海南岛上的人民，他们直到今天还呻吟在美蒋特务匪徒的屠刀和镣铐业中啊！我们必定要立誓去解放他们。当我记下了这笔血债走近展览室的出口时，看到一位同志在留言簿上写下了这样的决心：“我决心努力学习，加紧工作，多买公债，以求迅速地消灭残匪！”这是代表着中国人民为死难烈士复仇、为人类的正义而斗争的决心！
