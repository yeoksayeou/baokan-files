　　Beijing Pottery Industry Signs Labor-Management Collective Contract
　　Implements Quota-Based Wage System with Bonus for Over-Achievement
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau formally approved the labor-management collective contract for the Beijing Pottery Industry on March 12th. This is the eighth collective contract signed and approved in Beijing's private sector.

　　There are currently 24 pottery businesses in Beijing, mostly scattered around the 13th District, with 80 percent of their products sold to rural areas. Since liberation, business conditions have gradually improved, and workers have demanded higher wages. The employers also hoped for a reasonable resolution. Therefore, in January of this year, both sides appointed representatives to negotiate and sign a collective contract under the leadership of the Labor Bureau, the 13th District Federation of Trade Unions, and the industry's trade union and guild. During the preliminary agreement on the draft contract, both parties agreed to implement a quota wage system on a trial basis, which greatly boosted production enthusiasm. As workers actively completed their assigned production quotas and minimized damage to finished products, the employers gradually gained confidence in the effectiveness of signing the contract. After revisions by the Labor Bureau, the full text of the contract was quickly finalized.

　　At the contract approval meeting, both labor and management in the pottery industry expressed satisfaction with the "quota-based wage" and "bonus for over-achievement" provisions in the contract and expressed their willingness to thoroughly implement them. Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, explained in his speech that the bonus for the over-achievement portion should, in principle, exceed the average original wage (excluding meal expenses). For example, if a first-grade worker earned 477 jin of corn per month, guaranteeing 200 sets of good dried clay, the average wage per set would be 2.385 jin. If the worker produced 210 sets, the bonus for the extra 10 sets should be higher than 23.85 jin. The specific amount should be negotiated and decided by labor and management based on actual conditions. At the same time, he pointed out that this contract, which stipulates a quota wage system, is a major step forward in contract signing in Beijing and will become the direction for the Labor Bureau to guide various private industries in signing contracts in the future. He hoped that representatives of both labor and management would further study the contract provisions and convey them to both employers and employees. In addition to the more than 20 labor and management representatives from the pottery industry, representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the 13th District Federation of Trade Unions, and the industry's trade union and guild also attended the meeting and delivered speeches, all agreeing that including this quota wage system in the contract has a significant positive effect on developing production.

　　京盆窑业签订劳资集体合同
    实行定额计资超额奖励
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府劳动局于三月十二日正式批准北京市盆窑业劳资集体合同。这是京市私营行业第八个集体合同的签订和批准。
    京市盆窑业现共有二十四家，多散布在十三区一带，产品百分之八十销售于农村。解放后由于营业情况日渐好转，工人要求提高工资，资方也希望合理解决，双方乃于今年一月间各推代表，在劳动局及十三区工会办事处和该业工会、同业公会的领导下，进行协商订立集体合同。在合同草案初步协议时，双方即同意试行定额工资制的规定，因之生产情绪大大提高。由于工人积极完成了等级的生产定额，尽量减少成品的损坏，资方才渐渐对订立合同的效果建立了信心。合同全文经劳动局修改后，很快地就获得最后通过。
    在合同的批准会上，盆窑业劳资双方对合同中“定额计资”和“超额奖励”的规定，一致表示满意并愿遵照彻底执行。劳动局马光斗副局长在致词中说明：超额部分的奖励金，其数额以高过原工资平均数（不包括饭费）为原则，例如一等工资每月玉米四百七十七斤，保证交好干坯二百套，即每套平均工资为二点三八五斤，如该项工人作了二百一十套，其超出的十套给予之奖金，应高于二十三点八五斤。具体数目由劳资双方按实际情况协商决定。同时他指出：这个合同规定了定额工资制，是京市订立合同以来的一大进步，它将成为劳动局今后领导各私营行业订立合同的方向。希望劳资双方的代表对合同条文进一步加以研究，并向资方和劳方作普遍的传达。到会的除盆窑业劳资双方代表二十余人外，市总工会、第十三区工会办事处及该业工会、同业公会都派有代表参加，并先后在会上致词，都认为在合同中订出这种定额工资制，对发展生产有很大的积极作用。
