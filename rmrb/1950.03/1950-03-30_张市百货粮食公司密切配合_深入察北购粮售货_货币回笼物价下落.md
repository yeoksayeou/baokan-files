　　Zhangjiakou City Department Store and Grain Company Closely Cooperate
    深入察北购粮售货  货币回笼物价下落

(From Our Newspaper) According to the March 25th report from the Chahar Daily: To implement the spirit of the Provincial Trade Cooperation Conference, the Zhangjiakou Department Store sent a team to Zhangbei on the 13th of this month. However, because they were still confined to Zhangbei city, especially since they had not yet contacted other parties or integrated with cooperatives at that time, business could not be developed, and the average daily sales revenue was only 300,000 yuan. Even the habit of bartering in nearby villages around Zhangbei had not been significantly broken through, which also affected the grain company's grain purchasing efforts. The company studied the above situation and the demand for a significant currency withdrawal task, and decided to further change its working methods. On the 15th, a large quantity of sugar, matches, cloth, cotton, and other general merchandise was transported to Shangdu, which was warmly welcomed by the local people. Sales revenue reached 8 million yuan in one day, quickly reversing the unequal exchange of industrial and agricultural products in the Shangdu market and reducing the severe exploitation by private merchants. Taking brown sugar as an example, the company sold it for 4,000 yuan per pound in Zhangbei and 4,500 yuan per pound in Shangdu after adding transportation costs. Before the company arrived in Shangdu, private merchants sold it for 14,000 to 17,000 yuan per pound. For a long time, the price of general merchandise in Shangdu was about four times that of Zhangbei. Recently, the price of brown sugar in Shangdu has also dropped to 7,000 yuan per pound, and the price of general merchandise has fallen by 50 percent. Up to this point, the excessively heavy intermediate exploitation in the Shangdu market has begun to change. In particular, the close cooperation between the grain and department store companies has enabled farmers to buy goods as soon as they sell grain, gradually opening up the currency front and facilitating grain procurement. The Zhangbei Grain Branch has recently set up grain purchasing stations in central townships such as Daqinggou, Dengyoufang, and Pingdingbao, and the department store company is also closely following up its business through cooperatives. The two companies have achieved great success in grain procurement and currency withdrawal. The department store company has sold more than 84.2 million yuan in four days. Moreover, wherever business penetrates, currency occupies the ground. Currently, the two companies plan to quickly expand their business to counties such as Hua (de), Kang (bao), Shang (yi), and Bao (yuan) on the existing foundation, with particular emphasis on combining with cooperatives to gradually reverse the unequal exchange of agricultural and industrial products for better urban-rural material exchange.

　　张市百货粮食公司密切配合
    深入察北购粮售货  货币回笼物价下落
    【本报讯】据三月二十五日察哈尔日报消息：张家口百货公司，为贯彻省贸易合作会议精神，本月十三日即派小组赴张北。但因为他们仍然局限在张北城内，特别是当时尚未与其他方面联系，与合作社结合。因此，业务无法展开，每天平均卖钱三十万元。连张北附近乡村，以物易物的习惯也未重点突破，同时也影响了粮食公司购粮工作的进行。该公司研究了上述情况，和重大的回笼任务要求，决定进一步改变工作方法。十五日将大批糖、洋火、布棉等杂货运往商都，受到当地群众热烈欢迎。一天内卖钱八百万元。迅速扭转了商都市场工农业品不等价交换，减少了私商严重的中间剥削。以红糖为例，公司在张北售价每斤四千元，到商都加运费卖四千五百元，而公司未到商都前，每斤红糖私商卖一万四千元到一万七千元。很长时期商都一般杂货，四倍左右于张北。最近商都红糖也落至每斤七千元，一般杂货落价百分之五十。至此商都市场畸重的中间剥削开始转变。特别是粮食、百货公司开始密切配合，使农民卖了粮就能买到货，渐渐打开了货币阵地，便利了粮食收购工作。张北粮食支公司最近在大清沟、邓油坊、平定堡等中心乡镇设购粮站，百货公司也通过合作社，使业务紧紧跟上去。两公司的购粮与回笼工作成绩很大。百货公司四天卖钱八千四百二十多万元。而且业务深入到那里，货币在那里就占领了阵地。目前两公司计划在现有的基础上，很快的把业务深入到化（德）、康（保）、尚（义）、宝（源）等县，特别强调和合作社结合，以逐渐扭转农工业品交换不等价更好的进行城乡物资交流。
