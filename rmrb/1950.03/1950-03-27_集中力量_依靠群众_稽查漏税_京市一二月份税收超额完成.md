    Beijing's January-February Tax Revenue Exceeds Target
    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Beijing's January and February tax revenues exceeded the target (based on the monthly target listed in the annual budget), with January exceeding the original plan by 23 percent and February exceeding it by 72 percent. Among the various taxes, January's Goods Tax reached 145 percent of the target, Commercial Tax reached 183 percent, Stamp Tax reached 135 percent, while Interest Income Tax and Special Consumption Tax decreased somewhat. In February, Goods Tax reached 204 percent of the target. Even after deducting the temporary Goods Supplementary Tax revenue of approximately 1.7 million *jin* of millet, it still exceeded the original plan by more than 51 percent. Interest Income Tax increased significantly, reaching 323 percent of the target. Commercial Tax reached 145 percent. With the exception of Stamp Tax and Transaction Tax, which decreased slightly, Slaughter Tax, Special Consumption Tax, and liquor monopoly profits all exceeded the original plan.
    The proportion of Interest Income Tax in the overall tax revenue is very small, with a monthly target of only 100,000 *jin* of millet. However, the tax increased sharply in February, indicating that bank and money shop deposits have increased significantly as prices gradually stabilize, which is a very good phenomenon.
    The above achievements in tax revenue for these two months can be attributed to the following reasons: First, since the rectification of Beijing's tax revenue in August of last year, tax cadres at all levels have gradually gained a correct understanding of tax revenue, have placed importance on tax work ideologically, and have established various tax-related systems and regulations, exploring some experiences in urban tax revenue. Therefore, tax revenue has been increasing month by month. The fact that tax revenue was able to exceed the target in January and February of this year is a direct result of this effort. Second, regarding the use of cadre strength, since there was no seasonal tax revenue in January, it was clearly stipulated that the focus should be on rectifying regular tax revenue. In addition to rectifying Goods Tax, a comprehensive inspection was conducted on Commercial Tax, Stamp Tax, and Transaction Tax. In February, due to the new unified national Goods Tax Law promulgated by the Government Administration Council, in addition to continuing to rectify regular tax revenue, the main task was Goods Supplementary Tax. By concentrating the use of strength, grasping the key links, and closely relying on the masses during the investigation process, paying attention to minor or suspicious issues, and tracking them down, a total of 4,151 cases of violations, large and small, were discovered in January, with a supplementary tax of 182.11 million *yuan*. Including fines and income from the sale of confiscated goods, a total of 431.06 million *yuan* was added to the state revenue. This also served as an education for law-breaking industrialists and merchants. For example, some merchants within the jurisdiction of the Fourth Sub-bureau said: "In the future, we will never dare to violate the government's regulations again. When buying goods from merchants, we must deduct their taxes." In addition, January and February are peak months for industry and commerce, which is also a reason for the increase in tax revenue. From this, it can be estimated that the completion of the tax revenue task in Beijing's 1950 budget is sufficiently assured.

　　集中力量  依靠群众  稽查漏税
    京市一二月份税收超额完成
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：京市一、二月份税收超额完成（以全年概算所列之每月应完成数为基数），一月份超过原计划的百分之二十三，二月份超过百分之七十二。在各项税收中，一月份货物税完成百分之一百四十五，行商税完成百分之一百八十三，印花税完成百分之一百三十五，利息所得税及特种行为消费税降低了一些；二月份货物税完成百分之二百零四，其中除去临时的货物补税收入约一百七十万斤小米，仍超过原计划的百分之五十一点多，利息所得税增加很多，完成了百分之三百二十三，行商税完成了百分之一百四十五，除印花税及交易税略有降低外，屠宰税、特种行为消费税及酒专卖利润等项均超过了原计划。
    利息所得税在整个税收中占的比重甚小，每月计划只有十万斤小米，但二月份该税骤然增加很多，说明在物价渐趋稳定的情况下，银行钱庄的存款已显著增加，这是一个十分好的现象。
    这两个月的税收能够获得如上的成绩，有下列几个原因：第一、京市税收自去年八月加以整顿后，各级税收干部对于税收逐渐有了正确认识，思想上重视了税收工作，并建立了各种有关税收的制度规章，摸索得到了一些城市税收的经验，因此税收逐月增加。今年一、二月份税收能超额完成，就是这一努力的直接结果。第二、在干部力量的使用上，由于一月份没有季节性税收，因而明确规定以全力整顿经常性税收为主，除货物税加以整顿外并全面检查了行商、印花、及交易三税；二月份因政务院新颁布了全国统一的新货物税法，除继续整顿经常税收外，则以货物补税为主要工作。由于集中使用力量，抓住了主要环节，并在进行稽查中，紧密地依靠群众，注意细小的或可疑的问题，跟踪追迹，一月份共查获大小违章案件四千一百五十一件，补税一亿八千二百一十一万余元，连同罚款及没收品变卖收入共四亿三千一百零六万余元，为国家增加了一笔收入，并借此教育了不守法的工商业者。如第四分局所辖范围内有些商人说：今后可不敢再违背政府的章程了，再买行商的货物，一定要扣下他的税。此外，一、二月份是工商业的旺月，也是使税收增加的一个原因。从此可以估计，京市一九五○年预算中税收任务的完成是有足够把握的。
