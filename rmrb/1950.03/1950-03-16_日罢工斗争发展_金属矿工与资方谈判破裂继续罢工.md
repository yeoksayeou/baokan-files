The metal miners, who have been holding a nationwide strike since the 7th, broke down in negotiations with the capitalists on the 13th and are continuing their strike. At the same time, the All-Japan Electrical Workers' Union continues to hold rotating power outage strikes in many parts of the country, and has strengthened power outages to large-scale factories and government agencies.
