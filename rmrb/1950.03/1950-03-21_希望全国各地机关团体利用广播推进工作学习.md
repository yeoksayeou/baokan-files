    Hope that organizations and groups across the country will use broadcasting to promote work and study

    Editor:
    Broadcasting is a powerful tool for propaganda and education. It is impossible to have radios universally available throughout the country today. However, it is possible to organize existing radios for full utilization and to strategically set up loudspeakers.

    As far as I know, the Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station and the Municipal Enterprise Trade Union have jointly organized employee learning lectures with great success. This can solve the panic of lacking teachers and avoid errors in explanation due to the low level of teachers. Inviting workers to broadcast on the radio also plays a good role in spreading production experience and encouraging production enthusiasm. Therefore, I suggest that trade unions in major cities, student unions in various schools, and larger organizations should make good use of radio stations, cooperate with radio stations, establish radio listening groups, collect their learning requirements or other issues, and invite experts from the radio station to explain them and broadcast them regularly (which can be notified in the local newspaper the day before).

    希望全国各地机关团体利用广播推进工作学习编辑同志：
    广播事业是强有力的宣传教育工具，在今天要求全国各地普遍设立收音机是不可能的，但如何将现有的收音机组织起来以充分利用和有重点地设置扩音器，则是可能的。
    据我所知，天津市人民广播电台与市政企业工会联合组织的职工学习讲座收效很大。这可以解决缺乏教员的恐慌和不致因教员水准低而闹出讲解上的错误。请工人到电台广播，对传播生产经验、鼓励生产热情也起了很好的作用。因此我建议：各大城市工会、各校学生会及较大的机关团体要好好利用广播电台，和广播电台合作，建立收听广播的小组，搜集他们的学习要求或其他问题，由电台请专人讲解，定时播出（可于前一日由当地报纸通知）。
