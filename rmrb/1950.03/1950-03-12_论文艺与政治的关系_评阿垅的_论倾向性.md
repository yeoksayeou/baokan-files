On the Relationship Between Literature and Art and Politics
    — A Critique of A Long's "On Tendency" —
    Chen Yong
    In the current theory and practice of literature and art, the relationship between literature and art and politics is frequently encountered. This is quite natural, because the relationship between literature and art and politics is the fundamental issue of literary science. Correctly resolving this issue is the most important guarantee for enabling creative work to develop normally.
    However, a paper by Mr. A Long entitled "On Tendency," recently published in the first issue of "Literary Study" (the organ of the Tianjin Literary Association), offers an incorrect and erroneous interpretation of the relationship between literature and art and politics.
    In his paper, A Long also uses a large amount of space and numerous citations to oppose the idea of art for art's sake, and also affirms Plekhanov's conclusion on this issue, believing that art for art's sake is itself a certain kind of tendency. But opposing art for art's sake does not equate to resolving the relationship between art and politics from a correct standpoint. Although expressed in a very circuitous manner, and although his own explanations are interspersed with many citations from the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao Zedong, his own true thoughts can still be found. On the surface, A Long appears to be quite proper; he is merely supporting the idea of "unity of art and politics" and opposing the formulaic approach that only emphasizes politics and not art. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "There are two criteria for literary and art criticism, one is the political criterion, and the other is the artistic criterion," and also said: "Our requirement is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible artistic form. Works lacking in artistry, no matter how progressive they are politically, have no power." A Long cites these words of Comrade Mao Zedong, but crudely distorts Comrade Mao Zedong's original intent. In all of his words, Comrade Mao Zedong is explaining that political and artistic qualities are different but also related. On the one hand, artistic and political qualities cannot be absolutely separated, but on the other hand, it is common for the political and artistic qualities of a work of art to be unbalanced or inconsistent; sometimes the artistic quality is higher than the political quality, and sometimes the opposite may be true. Denying the distinction between political and artistic qualities or denying their connection are both undialectical and erroneous views. At the same time, "in any class society and in any particular class within a class society, the political standard is always placed first, and the artistic standard is placed second." A Long happens to not see this point, or happens to intentionally avoid this point in his citations. In his paper, he announces his purely idealistic viewpoint in a very straightforward manner, which is: "Art is politics."
    We say that all art contains a certain political tendency and a certain class content; "supra-class" and "supra-political" art does not exist. But this does not mean that the authors and works belonging to a certain class are the best representatives of that class's political demands. The less feudal and bourgeois authors are bound and limited by their own class ideology, the more truthful their works are. In proletarian authors, class character and truthfulness are completely consistent, but not all of them are strongly partisan. Among them, the problem of impure or weak party spirit often occurs. Before the rectification campaign and the Forum on Literature and Art, many literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois backgrounds in the proletarian camp had many areas of impure or weak party spirit, both in their works and in their actual actions. Even now, it cannot be said that everyone has undergone thorough transformation. Especially at present, for many literary and art workers who have not been transformed or fundamentally transformed, their problem is precisely not having too much politics, but too little. It seems that A Long is very willing for writers to become "engineers of the human soul," and his paper quotes this phrase. But to achieve this, one must first stand at the level of Marxist-Leninist thought, at the level of Mao Zedong Thought and the policy thought of the Communist Party and the People's Government. If the thought level of a writer, or perhaps even a theorist, is only equal to the average score of the masses' thought level, then even if he is self-righteous, he will not actually be able to become an "engineer of the human soul." And A Long's statement that "art is politics" is tantamount to telling all authors that no matter who they are, no matter what their works are, it is enough to do a good job in art; good art will naturally be good politics. And all attempts to better study politics and better serve politics are superfluous and can only produce "formulaism." Because "art is politics"!
    But precisely because he starts from erroneous principles like "art is politics," A Long, under the banner of opposing formulaism, opposes all concepts, including all progressive concepts. He says:
    "A concept, including a political concept, has a certain distance from living reality and living people. If a concept is not mutually exclusive with reality and is not completely false to people, then ultimately, from art to politics, it is powerless and ineffective. The first condition of art is truth; this concept is not truth, neither the truth of thought, nor the truth of art, nor the truth of politics."
    Here, A Long holds a completely erroneous view of concepts. As different means of cognition, the image of art and the concept of science are contradictory, but as a true and reliable reflection of reality, they are consistent. It is true that Lenin said: "Phenomena are richer than laws," and that there is a distance between concepts and reality. But on the other hand, as Lenin said, "From the concrete to the abstract, thinking does not depart from—if it is correct...—truth, but approaches truth. ...All scientific (correct, serious, not fabricated) abstractions reflect nature more deeply, more correctly, and more completely." (Liberation Press edition, "Summary of Hegel's Science of Logic," page 134) These thoughts of Lenin, and A Long's thought that all concepts are "mutually exclusive with reality" and "completely false," are they not mutually exclusive? Is there even the slightest common ground? It is true that the image, as a characteristic of art, means that "the tendency should not be specifically stated but should let itself flow out of the situation and actions." These principles are correct. But when our creation generally lags behind the objective political requirements, when an author who originally did not have too much politics but too little, temporarily expresses himself in a relatively crude way artistically in order to explore new themes that meet the urgent needs of reality, or when the artistic and political qualities, the author's life experience, and his own subjective intentions are not consistent, this is also quite natural. Here, undoubtedly, a theoretical critic should not start from the definition of art, but should start from the actual situation. That is to say, he should first affirm the author's efforts, and at the same time point out his inconsistencies, so that he gradually moves towards consistency. But A Long does not do this. He suppresses everything under the so-called name of "formulaism." In his view, his so-called "formulaism" is all "false," "distorted," "superficial," "paralyzing," "lying," and "falsifying." In this situation, if someone says that A Long's theory cannot have any positive effect, but can only block the author's path forward, is there even the slightest exaggeration?
    But, "the theme arises from the writer's experience," "thought arises from flesh and blood and lives in flesh and blood," A Long will say at this time. Is this wrong? Yes, this is not wrong, but correct. But if you allow me to ask in return, then: are these propositions contradictory and incompatible with an author consciously accepting certain political guidance? Since knowledge of the laws of reality is drawn from real life, using knowledge of the laws of reality to guide a writer's practice and guide a writer to correctly understand reality, and to find new laws from reality, and to correct, supplement, and enrich existing laws, this is precisely in line with the reasonable dialectical process of cognition. Abandoning all the experience of predecessors, abandoning the guidance of correct thought, and going to life empty-handed to understand life and to find "thought" that "lives in flesh and blood," I think, if there really are such people in the world, they are either completely arrogant or they can only be said to be completely stupid! Moreover, as it stands now, in any case, the individual experience of a creator is always limited, while the Communist Party and the People's Government, which centrally represent the interests of the entire people, constantly sum up huge political experience, which no matter how great even a genius is cannot be compared with it. And these experiences are embodied in the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Our creators, in any case, should be close to these political experiences, absorb these experiences, dissolve these experiences, and make them popular in every corner and among every mass. But A Long does the opposite. He guides our authors away from these, saying "art is politics," which is equivalent to guiding authors to take the wrong path, to the point of completely losing direction.
    Here, we seem to need not criticize the abstract "supra-class" concepts such as "the first condition of art is truth," because this is actually not something new to us.
    In addition, A Long also quoted Chernyshevsky, saying that art is "beauty," is "something dear," but if so, then the explanation for "beauty" and "something dear" should also be different. Chernyshevsky, who once believed that "art is a textbook of life" and was called a great democrat and utopian socialist by Lenin, his thought cannot annotate A Long's essentially formalist thought. We can only find a clear opposition in the middle. Because Chernyshevsky himself proved to us such a fact: because a work of art puts forward a new and advanced concept, even if it is temporarily too late to achieve perfection artistically, it can often generate a huge appeal. Chernyshevsky wrote a novel called "What Is to Be Done?" Everyone can feel that this is a novel that is not very consistent in artistry and ideality, somewhat conceptualized, but because it expressed a new concept, a new outlook on life, and new characters that many Russian writers at the time had not yet expressed, it became one of the most shocking works of the hearts of young readers of the time, and also one of the greatest works of the time. Isn't this a well-known fact? Would anyone with a sense of reality say that "What Is to Be Done?" is false or distorted? And in this situation, should we support objective historical truth? Or should we support A Long's strange principle that all concepts are "false" and "mutually exclusive with reality"?
    Of course, genuine formulaism should be opposed, and mechanical "art plus politics" should be opposed. But there are also various different ways to oppose formulaism. A Long once quoted a passage from Comrade Wang Chaowen saying: "The origin of formulaism is not only that the writer does not value propaganda too much, on the contrary, it is his weak sense of responsibility for propaganda—regardless of the effect." I think this passage itself still has things worth considering. People who have committed the shortcomings of formulaism in their own works, of course, cannot be said to be without those who have a "weak sense of responsibility for propaganda—regardless of the effect," but at present, it seems that more are because their cultivation in politics, art, and life is not high enough. Their works are indeed not well written, but for writing, they are not necessarily without enthusiasm, not necessarily without sincerity. For such people, instead of scolding them for a "weak sense of responsibility for propaganda—regardless of the effect," it is better to give them more practical guidance and help. Otherwise, as Chairman Mao said, "The masses are still singing 'lower-class tunes,' if you don't go to improve it, only care about scolding people, then no matter how you scold it is empty." As everyone knows, many of the literary and art workers in our original old liberated areas were cultivated only after the Anti-Japanese War. They are still young. In the long period of arduous struggle, they followed Chairman Mao's literary and art policy to work, but generally had few opportunities to improve themselves in theory and art. Even in life, they were often limited by their specific work. In addition, in the past, there was a great lack of regular ideological guidance and specific help in the field of literature and art. It is very natural for their works to have various shortcomings. They cannot improve as quickly as we imagine and as they themselves urgently demand. However, those who have had the opportunity to improve themselves very much should not forget the pain of those who have not yet improved, just as the well-fed should not forget the pain of the hungry. Therefore, even for the shortcomings of formulaism that they have committed, they cannot be changed simply by giving them some blows. What's more, like A Long, generally saying that formulaism is "false," "distorted," "superficial"...? What's more, uniformly calling all works that express progressive tendencies but are temporarily not perfect enough in art as formulaism?
    Finally, I think I can also talk about a theoretical issue. In his paper, A Long also cited individual sentences from Engels' letter to Harkness, like many others who oppose formulaism. "The less the author's opinion is revealed, the better the work of art." "The realism in my mind, even without relying on the author's point of view, can show itself." As everyone knows, the previous two sentences were discovered on Engels' draft, the handwriting is blurred, and cannot be identified. Because the original letter has not yet been discovered, it is really not certain whether it fully conforms to Engels' original meaning. Even if this is completely Engels' original sentence, I think it can only be linked to the historical environment at that time to get a more reasonable explanation. In the era when Marx and Engels were alive, the truly false petty-bourgeois "tendency literature" was rampant in German society. Marx and Engels first emphasized the principle of realism, because there were no real proletarian writers at the time. They even borrowed classical realist writers to counter the trend of "tendency literature." This is why it is said that "the realism in my mind, even without relying on the author's point of view, can show itself." On the other hand, the proletarian revolution had not yet become a reality at that time. Literature and art had not yet become the direct property of the broad masses of workers and peasants. As Engels himself said, the main readers of literary works at that time were still people in the bourgeoisie. In this situation, Engels, as one of the great leaders of the world proletariat, had to consider the strategy of conducting ideological struggle against the bourgeoisie in the department of literature:
    "In our environment, novels are mainly supplied to bourgeois readers, that is, people who do not directly belong to our circle. Therefore, in my opinion, if a novel with a socialist tendency can faithfully describe the relations of reality, break the popular traditional illusions about these relations, shatter the optimism of the bourgeois world, and arouse doubts about the permanent rule of the existing order, then, even if the author does not provide any clear solution, or even does not obviously stand on that side, this novel has completed its mission." (Liberation Press edition, "Marxism and Literature and Art," page 89)
    Here, it is very clear that in order to facilitate the use of literary works to shake and disintegrate the thinking of bourgeois readers at that time, Engels first emphasized the objective "faithfully describing the relations of reality," while the "clear solution" to the problem, the writer's obvious position, etc., were temporarily placed in a secondary position. But by the era of Lenin and Stalin, the situation had obviously changed. At this time, the proletarian revolution and the construction of socialism had become a reality. Literature and art had become the direct property of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Literature and art were mainly no longer supplied to bourgeois readers, but became a tool for directly educating workers, peasants, and intellectuals. In this situation, the old principle of deliberately hiding one's own thoughts and viewpoints in works or not emphasizing the author's thoughts and viewpoints, which adapted to the old situation, should obviously not be insisted on. The relationship between literature and art and politics should obviously be closer, and the role of literature in the real struggle should obviously be improved. This is why Lenin happened to develop the principle of the party spirit of literature at this time. This is why the principle of party spirit became "Lenin's most important contribution to the science of literature" (Zhdanov).
    In this new era, the nature of proletarian literature and its tasks are precisely expressed in a classic definition of socialist realism. This definition says:
    "Socialist realism, as the basic method of Soviet literature and Soviet literary criticism, requires writers to describe reality truthfully, historically, and concretely in its revolutionary development.
    At the same time, the truthfulness and historical concreteness of artistic description must be combined with the task of ideologically transforming and educating the working people in the socialist spirit." ("Statutes of the Soviet Writers' Union," see Liberation Press edition, "Marxism and Literature and Art")
    Here, the requirements of realistic description and education are simultaneously brought before literary works. This shows the changes and developments in literary and art thought in the new era, and these changes and developments are precisely what A Long, who only knows how to cite Engels' individual words and sentences, does not understand.
    In a word, A Long's paper entitled "On Tendency" is formally conducting a two-front struggle, opposing art for art's sake and formulaism, but in essence, it is also opposing art serving politics. It begins by opposing art for art's sake and ends by opposing art actively serving politics. In fact, in China, where class struggle has always been extremely sharp, it is not the best environment for cultivating the theory of art for art's sake. A complete theoretical system of art for art's sake (if any) cannot be held. Moreover, a writer with somewhat revolutionary demands also requires some degree of battle, even if it is quite vague and gray, but is unwilling (at least has not yet realized today) to bring his art closer to the politics of the masses. He still hopes to retain a small piece of the land of his incomplete "art kingdom." So he rises up to resist the Marxist-Leninist thought on the party spirit of literature and art. No matter how much A Long has quoted Marxist-Leninist phrases, and no matter whether A Long himself clearly realizes it or not, I think the essence of his theory is like this. ★ ★ ★ ★
    Editor's note: A Long's quotation of Wang Chaowen's words is a severance of the original meaning. The original text precisely emphasized advocating that literature and art should propagandize for policies. The original text ("Serving Policies and Formulaism") was published in the first issue of "Literary Gazette" last year.

　　论文艺与政治的关系
    ——评阿垅的“论倾向性”——
    陈涌
    在目前文艺的理论和实践中间，经常接触到文艺与政治的关系问题。这是十分自然的，因为文艺与政治的关系问题，是文艺科学的根本问题，这个问题的得到正确的解决，是使创作能够正常发展的最重要的保证。
    但不久前发表在“文艺学习”（天津文协机关刊物）第一期里阿垅先生的一篇名为“论倾向性”的论文，却关于文艺与政治的关系作了不正确的错误的解释。
    阿垅在他的论文里也用了大量的篇幅大量的引证来反对为艺术而艺术的思想，并且也肯定了普列哈诺夫在这个问题上的结论，认为为艺术而艺术本身也是一种一定的倾向。但反对了为艺术而艺术并不就等于在正确的立场上解决了艺术与政治的关系问题。虽然表现得十分曲折，虽然在他自己的解说里，也渗杂着许多关于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、毛泽东的著作的引证，但他自己的真实的思想还可以寻找出来的。在表面上看来，阿垅是十分正当的，他不过是拥护“艺术与政治统一”的思想而反对只讲政治不讲艺术的公式主义。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“文艺批评有两个标准，一个是政治标准，一个是艺术标准”，同时还说过：“我们的要求则是政治与艺术的统一，内容与形式的统一，革命的政治内容与尽可能高度的艺术形式的统一，缺乏艺术性的作品，在政治上无论怎样进步，都是没有力量的。”阿垅援引了毛泽东同志的这些话，但对毛泽东同志的原意却作了鲁莽的歪曲。毛泽东同志在他全部的话里都在说明，政治性与艺术性是有区别同时又有联系的。一方面，艺术性和政治性是不能绝对分开来看的，但另一方面，艺术作品的政治性和艺术性表现得不平衡、不一致也是常事，有时艺术性高出于政治性，有时可能又相反。否认政治性与艺术性的区别或者否认他们的联系的见解都不是辩证法的，都是错误的。而同时，“无论什么样的阶级社会与无论什么阶级社会中各别阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”而阿垅却恰巧看不到这点，或者恰巧有意在自己的引证里避开了这点。他在他的论文里用十分直率的态度宣布了自己的纯粹唯心论的观点，这就是：“艺术即政治”。
    我们说，一切艺术都包含着一定的政治倾向，一定的阶级内容，“超阶级”、“超政治”的艺术是不存在的，但这并不等于说，属于某一阶级的作者和作品便都是该阶级的政治要求的最好的代表，封建阶级、资产阶级的作者，在思想上受本阶级的束缚与限制愈少，其作品的真实性就愈多，而在无产阶级作者，阶级性与真实性则是完全一致的，但他们也不都是党性很强的，在他们中间，往往有党性不纯或党性不强的问题发生。在整风以前和文艺座谈会以前，无产阶级阵营内，小资产阶级出身的许多文艺家，不论在作品上和在实际行动上，党性不纯或党性不强的地方便很多，就是到了现在也不能说每一个人都已经经过了彻底的改造，而特别是目前许多未经改造或未经根本改造的文艺工作者，他们的问题恰好不是政治太多，而是太少。看来阿垅是十分愿意作家都成为“人类灵魂的工程师”的，他的论文里便引用了这句话。但要做到这样，便首先要使自己站在马列主义思想水平上，站在毛泽东的思想水平和共产党与人民政府的政策思想水平上，如果一个作家或者还可以包括理论家的思想水平只等于群众思想水平的平均分数，那即使他怎样自以为是，实际上也是做不成“人类灵魂的工程师”的，而阿垅“艺术即政治”这句话，无异于告诉我们一切作者说：不论什么人，不论什么作品，只要把艺术搞好便够了，好的艺术便自然是好的政治了，而一切要想更好的学习政治，更好的服务于政治的企图，都是多余的了，都是只能产生“公式主义”的了。因为“艺术即政治”啊！
    但正因为从“艺术即政治”这类错误的原则出发，阿垅便在反对公式主义的旗帜下，反对一切概念，包括一切进步的概念。他说：
    “一种概念，包括政治概念，和活生生的现实和活生生的人，又是有着一种一定的距离的。概念，如果那不是和现实互相排斥的，不是对于人完全虚伪的，到底，从艺术到政治，那也是毫无力量的，没有效果的。艺术，首先的条件是真；这个概念，却不是真，既不是思想的真，就没有艺术的真，也不是政治的真。”
    在这里，阿垅对于概念抱着一种完全错误的看法。作为认识的不同的手段，艺术的形象和科学的概念是矛盾的，但作为对于现实的真实可靠的反映，它们又是一致的。不错，列宁便说过：“现象比规律丰富”，概念和现实是有距离的，但另一方面也正如列宁所说的，“从具体的东西上升到抽象的东西，思维不是离开——如果它是正确的……——真理，而是接近真理。……一切科学的（正确的、郑重的、不是胡诌的）抽象，都更深刻、更正确、更完全地反映着自然。”（解放社版《黑格尔逊辑学一书的摘要》，一三四页）列宁这些思想，和阿垅的认为一切概念都是“和现实互相排斥的”、“完全虚伪”的思想，难道不正是互相排斥，难道有丝毫共通的地方么？不错，形象之作为艺术的特质，“倾向应当是不要特别的说出而让它自己从情况和行动中流露出来”，这些原则都是正确的，但是当我们的创作一般地都落后于客观的政治要求的时候，当一个本来不是政治太多而是太少的作者，为了探求新的符合于现实迫切需要的主题而暂时在艺术上表现得比较粗糙，或者说，艺术性和政治性，作者的生活经验和自己的主观意图还不一致的时候，这也是十分自然的事。在这里，无疑的一个理论批评工作者便不应该从艺术的定义出发，而应该从实际的情况出发，这就是说，应该首先肯定这个作者的努力，同时也指出他的不一致，使他逐渐走向一致。但阿垅所做的却不是这样，他把这一切都在一个所谓“公式主义”的名目下加以压杀。在他看来，他所谓“公式主义”都是“虚伪”、“歪曲”、虚浮”、麻痹”、“说谎”、“做假”的。在这种情况下，如果有人说，阿垅的这种理论，不能发生任何积极的作用，而只能阻塞作者的前进的道路，难道有丝毫过分的地方么？
    但是，“主题是产生于作家的经验中的思想”啊，“思想产生于血肉，而活于血肉”啊，阿垅这时候又会说。难道这是错误的么？是的，这不是错误而是正确的。但如果容许我反问，那么：这些命题难道和一个作者自觉的接受一定的政治指导是矛盾不相容的么？现实规律的知识既然是从现实生活中抽引出来，用现实规律的知识来指导一个作家的实践和指导一个作家正确的认识现实，并从现实中间寻找新的规律，改正、补充并丰富已有的规律，这正符合于认识的合理的辩证过程。抛开了前人的一切经验，抛开了正确的思想指导而空手的到生活中去认识生活，去找寻“活于血肉”的“思想”，我想，世界上如果真有这样的人，他不是十足的狂妄自大也只能说他是一个十足的笨伯！而且，在现在说来，无论如何一个创作者个人的经验总是有限制的，而集中地代表全体人民利益的共产党和人民政府，却经常总结着巨大的政治经验，这是任何即使是伟大的天才都不可以和它相比拟的，而这些经验便体现在共产党和人民政府的政策里面。我们的创作者无论如何是应该和这些政治经验靠近，吸收这些经验，溶解这些经验，使它普及到每一个角落和每一个群众中去。而阿垅所做的却相反，他引导我们的作者离开这些，说什么“艺术即政治”，这就等于引导作者走入错路，以至于完全迷失方向的。
    在这里，我们似乎用不着批评所谓“艺术首先的条件是真”这类抽象的“超阶级”的观念了，因为这对于我们其实已经不是什么新奇的事物。
    此外，阿垅还引用了车尔尼舍夫斯基的话，说艺术是“美”，是“亲爱的东西”，但如果这样，那对于“美”和“亲爱的东西”的解释也当是各有不同的，曾经认为“艺术是人生的教科书”，曾经被列宁称为伟大的民主主义者和空想的社会主义者的车尔尼舍夫斯基的思想，是不能为阿垅那种本质上是形式主义的思想作注解的。我们只能在这中间找到鲜明的对立。因为车尔尼舍夫斯基自己便给我们证明了这样的事实：一个艺术作品由于它提出了一个新的先进的观念，即使暂时在艺术上还来不及做到完美的程度，它往往也能发生巨大的感召的力量。车尔尼舍夫斯基写过一本小说叫“何为”，谁也感觉得到，这是一本艺术性和思想性不很一致的多少有点概念化的小说，但由于它表现了当时许多俄国作家都还没有表现过的一种新的观念，新的人生观，新的人物，便成为当代最震撼青年读者心灵的作品之一，也是当代最伟大的作品之一。难道这不是众所周知的事实么？有那一个有现实感的人会说“何为”是虚伪，是歪曲呢？而在这种情形下，叫我们拥护客观的历史真理呢？还是拥护阿垅的那个认为凡是概念都是“虚伪”“和现实互相排斥的”奇异的原则呢？
    自然，真正的公式主义是应该反对的，机械的“艺术加政治”是应该反对的。但反对公式主义也有各种不同的反法。阿垅曾经引用了王朝闻同志的一段话说：“公式主义的来历，不仅不是作家太看重宣传，相反的，是他宣传的责任感的薄弱——不顾效果。”我以为这段话本身有还有值得考虑的地方，在自己的作品里犯有公式主义缺点的人，固然也不能说没有那种“宣传的责任感薄弱”的人在，但在目前，却似乎更多的是因为自己不论在政治上、艺术上和生活上的修养都不够高，他们的作品的确写得不好，但对于写作，他们却未必不是充满热情，未必不是诚诚恳恳的，对于这样的人，我们与其责骂他“宣传的责任感的薄弱——不顾效果”，还不如多给他一些切实的指导和帮助。否则，正如毛主席所说的，“群众还在那里唱“下里巴人”，你不去提高它，只顾骂人，那就怎样骂也是空的。”大家知道，我们原来老解放区的许多文艺工作者，很大的一部分都是在抗日战争以后才培养出来的，他们都还年青，在长时间的艰苦斗争中间，他们遵照了毛主席的文艺方针去工作，却一般的都很少有在理论上和艺术上提高自己的机会，即在生活方面，也往往为各自特定的工作所限制，加上在文艺方面过去十分缺少经常的思想指导和具体帮助，他们的作品存在着各种不同的缺点，是很自然的事，他们不能如我们所想像以及他们自己所迫切要求那样迅速的提高。但是，有了机会把自己提得很高的人似乎也不应该忘记还提不高的人的苦痛，正如饱汉不应忘记了饿汉的苦痛一样。因此对于他们所犯的即使是公式主义的缺点，也不是简单给他们一些打击便可以改掉的。更何况像阿垅一样，笼统的说公式主义是“虚伪”，是“歪曲”，是“虚浮”……？更何况把一切表现进步的倾向而在艺术上暂时还不够完美的作品都一律称之为公式主义？
    临末，我以为还可以谈一个关于理论的问题。阿垅在他的论文里还援引过恩格斯致哈克纳斯的书信里的个别的语句，如同许多别的反对公式主义的人一样。“作者的意见愈是不露锋芒，对艺术作品也就愈好。”“我心目中的现实主义，甚至不依赖作者的观点，就能够把它自己显示出来。”大家知道，前面这两句话是在恩格斯的草稿上发现，字迹模糊，不能辨认，因为原信还未发现，所以是否完全符合恩格斯的原意，实在还不能确定的。就算这完全是恩格斯的原句吧，我以为也只有连系到当时的历史环境，才能得到更合理的解释。在马克思和恩格斯活着的时代，那种真正虚伪的小资产阶级的“倾向文学”正在德国的社会上泛滥，马克思和恩格斯便首先强调现实主义的原则，因为当时还没有真正无产阶级的作家出现，他们便甚至借用了古典的现实主义的作家来对抗那种“倾向文学”的潮流，这就是为什么说“我心目中的现实主义，甚至不依赖作者的观点，就能够把它自己显示出来。”而另一方面，无产阶级革命在当时还没有成为现实，文艺还没有成为广大工农群众的直接的财产，正如恩格斯自己所说的，当时文艺作品主要的读者还是资产阶级里面的人，在这种情况下，作为世界无产阶级伟大领袖之一的恩格斯，不能不考虑到在文学这部门里对资产阶级进行思想斗争的策略：
    “在我们的环境中，小说主要地是供给资产阶级的读者，即是，不是直接属于我们这个圈子的人，因此，在我看来，一部具有社会主义倾向的小说，如果它能忠实地描写现实的关系，打破对这些关系的流行的传统的幻想，粉碎资产阶级世界的乐观主义，引起对于现存秩序的永久统治的怀疑，那末，纵使作者没有提供任何明确的解决，甚至没有明显地站在那一边，这部小说也是完成了它的使命的。”（解放社版“马克思主义与文艺”，八十九页）
    在这里看得十分清楚，为了便利于通过文学作品来动摇和瓦解当时资产阶级读者的思想，恩格斯首先强调的是客观的“忠实地描写现实的关系”，而对于问题的“明确的解决”，作家的明显的立场等等，则暂时放在一个次要的位置上。但到了列宁和斯大林的时代，情形显然是改变了，这时候，无产阶级革命和进行社会主义建设已经成为事实了，文艺已经成为广大工农群众的直接的财产，文艺主要地已经不再是供给资产阶级的读者，而成为直接教育工人、农民和知识分子的工具了。在这种情况下，适应着旧的情况的在作品里故意隐蔽自己的思想观点或者不强调作者的思想观点的旧原则，显然是不应该坚持了，文艺和政治的关系显然是应该更加密切，文学在现实斗争中的作用也显然应该提高。这就是为什么列宁恰好在这时候发展了文学的党性的原则，这就是为什么党性的原则成了“列宁在文学的科学中的最重要的贡献”（日丹诺夫）。
    在这新时代里，无产阶级的文学的性质和它的任务，被精确的表现在关于社会主义的现实主义的一个经典的定义里。这个定义说到：
    “社会主义的现实主义，作为苏维埃文学和苏维埃文学批评的基本方法，要求作家对于现实从其革命的发展中真实地，历史地具体地去描写。
    同时，艺术描写之真实性与历史的具体性必须与用社会主义精神从思想上去改造和教育劳动人民的任务结合起来。”（“苏联作家同盟规约”，见解放社版《马克思主义与文艺》）
    这里，现实主义的描写和教育性这两个要求，是同时被提到文学作品的面前来的。这表现了文艺思想在新时代里的变化和发展，而这些变化和发展，正是只知道援引恩格斯的个别词句的阿垅所不理解的。
    总的一句话说来，阿垅这篇名为“论倾向性”的论文，形式上是进行两条战线的斗争，反对为艺术而艺术和公式主义，但实质上，却是也同时反对艺术为政治服务的。它以反对为艺术而艺术始，以反对艺术积极地为政治服务终。事实上，在阶级斗争一向都异常尖锐的中国，并不是培植为艺术而艺术理论的最好的环境，完整的为艺术而艺术的理论体系（假如有的话），是抱守不住的了，而且一个多少有点革命要求的作家，他也要求某种程度即使是颇为朦胧灰色的战斗，但又不愿意（至少今天还未认识到）把自己的艺术更多的靠近群众的政治，他还希望保留自己一撮残缺不全的“艺术王国”的国土。于是他便起来抵抗马列主义的关于文艺的党性的思想。不管阿垅曾经怎样大量地引用过马列主义的词句，又不管阿垅自己明确地意识到与否，我以为他的理论的实质便是如此。  ★       ★        ★        ★
    编者按：阿垅所引王朝闻的话是割裂原意的。原文正是强调地主张了文艺为政策作宣传的。原文（“为政策服务与公式主义”）载去年《文艺报》第一期。
