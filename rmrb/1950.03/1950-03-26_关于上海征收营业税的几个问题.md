Editor's Note: The People's Daily editorial on the 22nd, "The Role of Taxation in Our National Work," pointed out that there have been two different viewpoints across the country regarding the methods of collecting urban industrial and commercial taxes: One advocated "self-declaration, public discussion, and democratic assessment"; the other advocated "self-declaration, actual payment, light taxes, and heavy penalties." The latter method is wrong. Shanghai used to adopt the "self-declaration and actual payment" method, which caused significant losses to national fiscal revenue. Shanghai is now correcting this error. However, the lesson described in this article still has universal educational significance for national taxation work.

In the early days of Shanghai's liberation, because the People's Government adopted a completely trusting attitude toward industrial and commercial households regarding tax payment issues, and because it did not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation of industrial and commercial households in the city at that time, in order to ensure timely fiscal revenue to support the war, it adopted the "self-declaration and actual payment" method for business tax collection. For more than half a year, the implementation of "self-declaration and actual payment" resulted in serious tax evasion by industrial and commercial households, and efforts are now being made to overcome this.

How does Shanghai's business tax burden actually compare with that of other cities across the country?

Compared with other cities, Shanghai's business tax burden is very light

Compared with Jiaxing, based on the business volume declared by merchants, the approximate business scale of the two cities is as follows:

	Business Income	Number of Shanghai	Number of Jiaxing	Percentage of Jiaxing
	Amount			Industrial and		Industrial and		Industrial and Commercial
					Commercial Households		Commercial		Households Compared to
										Households		Shanghai
	Under 1 million		34,287 households		2,313 households		6.74%
	1 million to 5 million	23,887 households		564 households		2.25%
	5 million to 10 million	4,721 households		104 households		2.21%
	10 million to 50 million	5,282 households		91 households		1.72%
	Over 50 million		1,099 households
	Total			69,276 households		3,072 households	(Note 1)

Given the significant difference in business scale between Shanghai and Jiaxing, what is the tax burden situation in the two places? According to materials from the Zhejiang Provincial Taxation Bureau, Jiaxing's monthly business tax collection was 600,000 jin of rice in October and November of last year. Based on Jiaxing's total of 3,072 industrial and commercial households, the average monthly burden per household was 195 jin of rice. Shanghai's business tax revenue for October and November was 16,837,819,713 yuan. Based on the average rice price of 55,378.5 yuan per shi in Shanghai during these two months, this is equivalent to 45,607,470 jin of rice. Calculating based on Shanghai's existing 93,766 industrial and commercial households, the average monthly burden per household is 491 jin of rice. Comparing Shanghai's industrial and commercial situation with Jiaxing, Shanghai's average burden is only one and a half times higher, which clearly shows how light Shanghai's burden is.

Compared with other cities, Shanghai's business tax burden on industrial and commercial households can definitely be said to be light, as comparisons can be made with other cities. Materials from several cities show that the capital and business volume of industrial and commercial households in those places are far behind Shanghai, but their burden is similar to Shanghai or even exceeds it. The following is a comparison of business tax revenue and the burden on industrial and commercial households in several cities:

	Location	Date			Business Tax Revenue		Average Monthly
						(Converted to Jin of Rice)	Burden Per Household
										(Jin of Rice)
	Qingdao		June to November		9,707,613 jin			194 jin
	Wuhu		May to December		9,733,395 jin			247 jin
	Hangzhou	April to December		21,904,920 jin			160 jin
	Wuxi		November to December	279,080 jin				160 jin
	Nanjing		August to December		9,215,502 jin			113 jin
	Shanghai	June to October		52,527,300 jin (Note 2)		140 jin

The industrial and commercial scale of several cities is quite different from that of Shanghai, but the average monthly burden per household is similar, and in many places it even exceeds it. Does this mean that the burden on industrial and commercial households in those places exceeds the tax rate? The typical survey material provided by the Southern Jiangsu Taxation Bureau regarding Wuxi last year answers this question. This material is as follows:

	Business Name	Business Type	Time Period		Business Volume	Tax Burden	Tax Amount as % of
										(Note 3)					Business Volume
	Yufeng		Cigarettes &		May to December	825,112,640 yuan	16,336,184 yuan	1.97%
			Candles

	Hengde		Oil Mill		May to December	2,091,030,80 yuan	32,897,722 yuan	1.59%

	Ruixin		Rice Mill		October to		550,273,538 yuan	12,070,232 yuan	2.19%
						December

	Dafu		Dried Goods		July to December	1,264,207,900 yuan	25,031,160 yuan	1.98%

Historical data can also help illustrate that the current business tax burden on industrial and commercial households in Shanghai is light. Over the years, Shanghai's tax revenue has often accounted for 60% of the national tax revenue. According to the burden ratio of industrial and commercial taxes in Wuhan and Shanghai over the past ten years, it is 100% to 2040%. A comparison of the tax revenue figures for the two cities in January this year shows that Shanghai is 229.2 billion yuan and Wuhan is 27.2 billion yuan, a ratio of 783 to 100. This shows that under normal circumstances, Shanghai's tax revenue can be 5 to 10 times that of Wuhan, but the first self-declared industrial and commercial tax completion figures for the two cities in 1950 were 1 to 1.863. Comparing the burdens in the two places, Shanghai is clearly light.

Due to Inaccurate Self-Reporting, the Resulting Burden is Very Uneven

From June to December of last year, Shanghai stipulated that those with a total monthly income of 750,000 yuan or more would be taxed, which, calculated at the rice price at the time, meant that those with a monthly business volume of less than 42.86 shi were exempt. Compared with Wuxi, the starting point for taxation in Wuxi was 250,000 yuan. Because the rice price in Wuxi was lower than in Shanghai, this means that the exemption point for industrial and commercial households in Shanghai was more than three times higher than that in Wuxi.

According to the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau's materials on taxpayers and exempt households in the city last year, the situation was as follows:

	Time Period		Taxpayers		Exempt Households		Percentage of Exempt
									Households Compared to
									Taxpayers
	June, July, August		35,421 households		39,740 households		52.87%
	September, October		49,291 households		34,722 households		41.38%
	November, December		74,783 households		15,489 households		16.68%
			   (Note 1 & 2)

The above materials show that the number of taxpayers is gradually increasing. This is because, first, due to rising prices and currency depreciation, the number of exempt households gradually decreased. Second, industries that were originally exempt, such as fresh meat and boiled water, also began to be taxed in the third phase. However, the problem here is that because the self-reporting of industrial and commercial households is inaccurate, the burden surface is greatly reduced, which creates an imbalance in the burden between urban industrial and commercial households and between them and other cities. This imbalance is reflected on the one hand in the fact that some industrial and commercial households do not report at all when paying business tax. This can be seen from the statistics of industrial and commercial households throughout the city. For example, there were more than 70,000 households in July and August, which increased to more than 80,000 households in September and October, and then increased to more than 90,000 households in November and December. The monthly increase in industrial and commercial households shows that the phenomenon of Shanghai industrial and commercial households evading taxes is serious. On the other hand, the point that those with more than 750,000 yuan would be taxed is based solely on the self-reporting of industrial and commercial households. In fact, this inevitably increases tax evaders. For example, the Xinxingshun Tofu Shop on Xibaoxing Road declared a business volume of 1.2 million yuan, but it was found to be more than double that in reality. This is just one example of the thousands of businesses that falsely report business volume.

Conversely, what was the situation in other parts of the country in this regard last year? Please see:

	Location	Survey Time	Total Number of		Taxpayers		Exempt Households
						Industrial and Commercial
						Households
	Beijing		August		39,938 households		36,013 households		3,925 households
	Tianjin		May			40,000 households		38,226 households		1,774 households
	Qingdao		July, August,		9,118 households		8,323 households		795 households
			September
	Nanjing		October		17,269 households		16,200 households		1,069 households
	Hangzhou	October		11,411 households		10,505 households		906 households

		Percentage of Taxpayers
		Compared to Total Number
		of Industrial and Commercial
		Households
		90.17%
		95.6%
		91.28%
		93.8%
		92.06%

The business tax starting point stipulated by the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has failed due to inaccurate self-reporting, and the tax surface has naturally been reduced. This shortcoming was promptly corrected in the recent work of levying business tax in January and February after the promulgation of the Interim Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax by the State Council of the Central People's Government on February 31st. However, it should be pointed out that this shortcoming has resulted in significant losses to national fiscal revenue.

Rising Prices Affect Tax Revenue, and More Than Half of National Treasury Revenue is Lost.

Another important reason why Shanghai's business tax burden is unreasonable is that when calculating the tax amount, it is not calculated in real terms, but in monetary units regardless of rising prices. Taking Nanjing's collection situation as an example for comparison: In October of last year, the average rice price in the city was 21,000 yuan per shi, 54,000 yuan in November, and 83,760 yuan in December. Nanjing began collecting the 1949 winter business tax on February 9, when the rice price had risen to 210,000 yuan. Suppose a merchant's business volume in October was 5 million yuan, Nanjing would convert it into 238.1 shi of rice based on the rice price of that month, and the tax amount would remain at 7.143 shi based on a tax rate of 3%. Assuming the same situation occurs in Shanghai, the same 3% tax rate would only collect 150,000 yuan, which, calculated at the Shanghai medium-grade white glutinous rice price of 260,000 yuan per shi on February 9, would only be equivalent to 0.575 shi of rice.

In order to understand what the failure to calculate the tax amount in real terms has caused for tax revenue, the following provides statistics on Shanghai's three phases of business tax revenue in the past six months:

(Attached Image)

As a result of Shanghai's business tax not being calculated in real terms, the above chart clearly shows that Shanghai's business tax should have received 546,930 shi of rice in July, August, September, and the first four months, but due to rising prices and the calculation of the tax amount in monetary units alone, it actually only received 350,182 shi. The lost amount accounts for 56.18% of the actual amount received. The average rice price in November had risen to 118,065 yuan per shi, but the tax revenue received was still the currency at the rice price of 35,183 yuan. In the past when prices were unstable, the tax authorities should have taken measures to protect national treasury revenue based on the actual situation. On this point, the method of calculating business tax based on rice prices in other places besides Shanghai is more appropriate. Shanghai's purely monetary calculation of tax amount seriously damaged national treasury revenue.

Tax Evasion is Very Serious, and the Collection Method Needs to be Improved Urgently

If you want to ask: What is the reason that Shanghai's business tax collection has caused this situation? The answer is: Because the phenomenon of tax evasion is very serious, and the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has not taken effective measures to stop it for a long time.

After the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau initially adopted the self-declaration and actual payment method, it attempted to organize accounting checks to stop tax evasion, but because there were too many industrial and commercial households in Shanghai, and the scope and extent that the accounting staff could control were very limited (the scope of accounting checks covered about 5% of all taxpayers), this doomed the "self-declaration and actual payment" collection method to failure. Letting industrial and commercial households self-report, but the self-reporting is false; conducting general inspections, but the inspections cannot be completed; knowing that there are falsehoods, but not being able to check all the accounts, so they have to treat the falsehoods as truth and collect taxes in this way. Wouldn't this mean that "self-declaration and actual payment" would fall through?

It should be emphasized that the tax evasion behavior of industrial and commercial households in Shanghai is very serious. The following materials can show a rough outline of the tax evasion situation in Shanghai. Among them, the serious tax evasion situations of American Meilong Foreign Firm and Yonghe Tobacco Firm are not very common, but the situations of Futai, Yisheng, and Xiechanghe are more general:

	Manufacturer Name	Business	Self-Declared	Business Volume		Tax Evasion
				Type		Business Volume	After Accounting Check		Percentage
	American		Import & Export	338,539,330 yuan	15,269,470,000 yuan	4,400%
	Meilong Foreign Firm	& Agency
				Shipping Passenger	9,330 yuan		70,048 yuan			415%
				& Freight

	Yonghe Tobacco Firm	Cigarettes	29,194,080 yuan	223,633,670 yuan		666%

	Futai			Chemical Raw	38,829,000 yuan	62,858,000 yuan		60.19%
				Materials

	Yisheng		Hardware	5,404,000 yuan	8,782,000 yuan		62.5%

	Xiechanghe		Fried Goods	7,230,000 yuan	10,850,000 yuan		50%

After the end of the third phase of business tax collection in Shanghai in November and December, the city's Direct Taxation Bureau inspected 5,845 industrial and commercial households, and found that 4,434 of them evaded taxes, accounting for 75.86% of all inspected units. The amount of supplementary tax received was more than 19.49 billion yuan, accounting for more than 108% of the original declared tax amount of 17.5 billion yuan for the 4,434 tax-evading units. The same fact can be seen from typical surveys of various industries. According to the recent understanding of materials from 307 households in 49 industries, the number of tax-evading households reached 62.43%. Taking the chemical raw material industry as an example: The original declared business volume of eight households, including Futai, Tongfeng, and Yifengheng, was 2.314417 billion yuan, but the actual business volume was found to be 3.067778 billion yuan. Among them, Yifengheng, which evaded the most taxes, accounted for 87.3% of the difference between the self-declared amount and the actual amount. Rifeng, which evaded the least taxes, accounted for 45.2% of the underreported tax amount compared to the self-declared amount. This is in stark contrast to what was written in the Shanghai Municipal Finance Report in September last year: "A series of measures have been taken to eliminate false accounts, and the elimination of false accounts has been achieved."

The serious tax evasion phenomenon in Shanghai has made it impossible for the "self-declaration and actual payment" collection method to continue. This fact that has caused huge losses to national fiscal revenue has aroused serious attention from the Shanghai leadership. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has instructed the taxation bureau to take appropriate steps to correct it.

(Note 1) This material is a statistic of major industries in Shanghai, so it is not complete and there is a discrepancy with the existing number of industrial and commercial households in Shanghai.
(Note 2) This figure is based on the total amount of business tax revenue deposited in the treasury from August to December (excluding peddler's tax and fines and late payment fees for business tax). The number of rice is calculated based on the average rice price in the month the payment was received. The number of industrial and commercial households is based on materials of 92,766 households.
(Note 3) The tax burden includes stamp tax, vehicle license tax, etc., but does not include income tax for profit-making enterprises.
(Note 4) Last year, Shanghai collected business tax every two months. The tax amount deposited in the treasury before December was the tax revenue amount for the first and second phases of business tax.
(Note 5) Because this month, tax refunds were made to industrial and commercial households for reasons such as incorrect tax rate calculations in the past, the word "reduction" indicates the amount of the refund.

　　关于上海征收营业税的几个问题
    本报特派记者  陆灏
    编者按：二十二日本报社论《税收在我们国家工作中的作用》中曾指出：全国各地在征收城市工商业税的方法上，曾经存在过两种不同的观点：一种主张是“自报公议，民主评定”；另外一种主张是“自报实缴，轻税重罚。”后一种方法是错误的。上海市过去即曾采用“自报实缴”的方法，使国家财政收入受到重大的损失。现在上海正在纠正这一错误。但本文所述这一教训对全国税收工作仍有普遍的教育意义。
    上海在解放初期，由于人民政府对于工商业户在纳税问题上采取了完全信任的态度，加以当时对全市工商业户的实际情况了解不够，为保证及时的财政收入，以支援战争，于是在营业税的征收方法上，采取了“自报实缴”的办法。半年多以来，“自报实缴”实行的结果，发生工商业户严重的逃税行为，现在正设法加以克服。
    上海工商业户营业税的负担情况，与全国其他城市比较，实际究竟是怎样呢？
    与其他城市相比，上海营业税负担很轻
    以上海和嘉兴相比，根据商人自报的营业额，从两个城市大致上的营业规模看有如下的情况：
    营业收入额    上海工商业户数  嘉兴工商    嘉兴工商户占上海					      业户数工商户百分比一百万元以下者        三四二八七户    二三一三户  百分之六·七四一百万元至五百万元者  二三八八七户    五六四户    百分之二·二五百万元至一千万元者  四七二一户      一○四户    百分之二·二一千万元至五千万元者  五二八二户        九一户    百分之一·七二五千万元以上者        一○九九户合计        六九二七六户三○七二户  （注一）
    营业规模相差如此悬殊的上海和嘉兴，两地负担的情况是怎样的呢？据浙江省税务局的材料，嘉兴在去年十月、十一月两个月内，每月营业税的征收为六十万斤大米。按嘉兴工商户总数为三千零七十二户，平均每月每户负担米为一百九十五斤、上海十、十一两个月收入营业税为人民币一百六十八亿三千七百八十一万九千七百十三元。按该两月上海平均米价每石为五万五千三百七十八元五角，计折大米为四千五百六十万七千四百七十斤。以上海现有工商户九万三千七百六十六户计算，每户每月负担米为四百九十一斤。拿上海工商业的情况与嘉兴相比，上海的平均负担仅高一倍有半，上海负担之轻，显然可见。
    上海工商业户营业税负担，与以上城市相比，肯定可以说是轻的，这因为还可以与其他城市作比较。若干城市的材料说明，那些地方一目了然，就可以知道工商业户的资本和营业额，远远落后于上海，但他们的负担却和上海相差无几，或甚至超过。下面就是几个城市的营业税收入和工商业户的负担比较：地名      日期        营业税收入折米数        每户每月平均米数青岛   六月至十一月   九、七○七、六一三斤          一九四斤芜湖   五月至十二月   九、七三三、三九五斤          二四七斤杭州   四月至十二月   二一、九○四、九二○斤        一六○斤无锡   十一月至十二月 二七九、○八○斤              一六○斤南京   八月至十二月   九、二一五、五○二斤          一一三斤上海   六月至十月     五二、五二七、三○○斤（注二）一四○斤
    若干城市与上海的工商业规模相差不小，但在每户每月的平均负担数上却相差无几，很多地方甚至超过，是不是那个地方工商业户的负担就超过了负担税率呢？苏南税务局所提供去年无锡的典型调查材料，回答了这个问题。这个材料是：工商户 营业性质 时间          营业额        税捐负担      纳税额占营名称				 	   （注三）       业额百分比裕丰   香烟皂烛 五月至十二月  八二五、一一  一六、三三    百分之一·九七			      二、六四○元  六、一八四元恒德   油厂     五月至十二月  二、○九、一  三二、八九    百分之一·五九			      ○三、○八○  七、七二二元			      元瑞新   米厂     十月至十二月  五五○、二七   一二、○七   百分之二·一九			      三、五三八元   ○、二三二元大福   南货     七月至十二月  一、二六四、二  二五、○三  百分之一·九八			      ○七、九○○元  一、一六○元
    历史的材料，也可以帮助说明上海工商业户现在营业税的负担是轻的。历年以来，上海税收经常占全国税收百分之六十。根据过去十年武汉与上海两市工商业税的负担比例，是百分之一百比百分之二千零四十。今年一月份，两市税收数字的比较，上海是二二九二亿元，武汉是二七二亿元，为七八三与一○○之比，可以说明，在一般情况下，上海税收可以相当武汉的五倍至十倍，但一九五○年第一次两市自报完成工商业税的数字，武汉与上海却为一比一、八六三。两地负担比较，上海显然是轻的。
    由于自报不真实，结果负担很不平衡
    上海自去年六月至十二月为止，规定每月总收入达七十五万元以上者起征，以当时米价计算，即每月凡营业额不满四二·八六石以下者免征。与无锡相比，无锡为二十五万以上者起征，由于无锡米价低于上海，这就是说：上海工商业户的免征点，高于无锡三倍有余。
    根据上海直接税局去年全市纳税户和免征户之材料，其情况是这样的：
  时间            纳税户        免征户        免征户占纳税户百分比六，七，八月份    三五四二一户  三九七四○户  百分之五二·八七九，十月份        四九二九一户  三四七二二户  百分之四一·三八十一，十二月份    七四七八三户  一五四八九户  百分之十六·六八
          （⑴⑵）
    上述材料说明，纳税户数是逐渐增加的。这是因为第一、由于物价上涨，货币跌价，逐渐减少了免征户。第二、对于本来免征的行业，如鲜肉、熟水等业，在第三期也开始征收了。但这里发生的问题是：由于工商户自报的不真实，就大大缩小了负担面，这就造成城市工商户互相之间及与其他城市之间的负担不平衡现象。这种不平衡，一方面表现在缴报营业税时，有的工商业户根本不报，从全市工商业户的统计数字来看就可以知道，如七、八月份为七万余户，到九、十月份增加到八万余户，至十一、十二月份，又增到九万余户。逐月工商业户增加的情况说明上海工商户逃避纳税的现象是严重的；另一方面，所谓七十五万元以上者起征这一点，仅仅是单纯根据工商业户的自报，这在事实上就必然增加了逃税户，象西宝兴路新兴顺豆腐店，自报一百二十万元营业额，据查实际超过一倍，这不过是千万家虚报营业额的一个例子而已。
    反之，全国其他地区，在去年这方面情况是怎样的呢？请看：
    地名    调查时间      工商业总户数  纳税户        免征户
    北京    八月          三九九三八户  三六○一三户  三九二五户
    天津    五月          四○○○○户  三八二二六户  一七七四户
    青岛    七、八、九月  九一一八户    八三二三户    七九五户
    南京    十月          一七二六九户  一六二○○户  一○六九户
    杭州    十月          一一四一一户  一○五○五户  九○六户
       纳税户占工商户总数之百分比
        百分之九○·一七
        百分之九五·六
        百分之九一·二八
        百分之九三·八
        百分之九二·○六
    上海直接税局规定的营业税起征点，由于自报不实，结果起征点的规定就告落空，负担面就自然缩小。此一缺点，在二月三十一日中央人民政府政务院工商业税暂行条例公布后，就及时于最近一、二月份营业税开征的工作中得到纠正。但应该指出：此项缺点，给予国家财政收入的损失是很大的。
    物价上涨影响税收，国库收入损失过半。
    上海营业税负担不合理的另外一个重要原因，就是计算税额时，不是实行折实结算，而是不顾物价上涨，采用货币为单位的计算办法。以南京的征收情况为例作比较：去年十月份，该市平均米价每石二万一千，十一月份为五万四千，到十二月份已涨到八万三千七百六十元。南京二月九日，开始征收一九四九年冬季营业税时，米价已涨到二十一万。假使某商户十月份营业额为五百万，南京则按当月米价折成米二百三十八石一斗，按百分之三税率计，税额始终保持为七石一斗四升三，假设同样情况发生在上海，同样百分之三税率只能征款十五万，按二月九日上海中白粳米价每石二十六万计算，折米仅为五斗七升五。
    为了了解未实行折实计算税额究竟对于税收造成了什么结果，下面提供去年六个月内上海三期营业税收入情况的统计：
    （附图  [图]）
    上海营业税，由于未实行折实计算税额的结果，上述图表明白指出上海营业税七、八、九、十四个月本来应该收入五十四万六千九百三十石大米，但由于物价上涨，单以货币为单位计算税额的结果，实际只收到三十五万零一百八十二石。其损失的数字占实际收到的数字百分之五十六·一八。十一月份平均米价，每石已涨到十一万八千零六十五元，而收进的税款，还是三万五千一百八十三元米价时候的货币。在过去物价不稳的情况下，税务机关应该按照实际情况，采取保障国库收入的措施，在这一点上说，上海以外各地按米价计算营业税的办法是比较妥当的，上海纯粹按照货币计算税额，严重损害了国库收入。
    逃税情况十分严重，征收方法急待改进
    如果要问：是什么原因使得上海营业税的征收，造成这样的情况呢？回答是：因为逃税现象十分严重，而上海直接税局长期内未采有效办法加以阻止。
    上海直接税局初期采取自报实缴办法之后，曾经企图组织查账工作来阻止逃税，但因为上海工商业户数太多，而查账人员的力量能控制的范围及程度，倒底有限得很（查账的范围约及全部纳税户百分之五），这就注定了“自报实缴”的征收方法，必然落空。让工商业户自报，但自报是假的，如普遍检查，但查不胜查，既知有假，又不能全部查账，于是只好以假当真，就此收税，岂不是“自报实缴”就落空了么？
    应该着重指出：上海工商业户的逃税行为是十分严重的。下面的材料，即可看到上海逃税情况一个大概的轮廓，其中如美隆洋行和永和烟行的严重逃税情况，虽不很普遍，但福泰、义生，协昌和的情况，却是比较一般的：厂商名称      经营业务      自报营业额      查账后营业额实数  逃税百分比美商美隆洋行  进出口及代办  三三八、五三    一五、二六九、四  百分之四千
              轮船客货运    九、三三○元    七○、○四八元    四百十五永和烟行      纸烟          二九、一九四、  二二三、六三三、  百分之六百
   		            ○八○元        六七○元          六十六福泰          化工原料      三八、八二九    六二、八五八万元  百分之六○·一九			    万元义生          五金          五、四○四万元   八、七八二万元   百分之六二·五协昌和        炒货          七二三万元       一、○八五万元   百分之五十
    上海在十一、十二两个月的第三期营业税征收结束后，该市直接税局曾经检查了五千八百四十五个工商业户，结果逃税单位，达四千四百三十四家，占全部检查单位的百分之七十五·八六。收到补税金额一百九十四亿九千余万，占四千四百三十四个逃税单位原报一百七十五亿税额的百分之一百零八强。从各种行业的典型调查中也可以看到同样的事实。据最近了解四十九个行业三百零七户的材料，其中逃税户数即达百分之六十二·四三。以化工原料业为例：该业福泰、同丰、义丰恒等八户，原报营业额为二十三亿一千四百十七万，但据查实际营业额为三十亿六千七百七十八万，其中逃税最多的义丰恒，占自报差额达百分之八十七·三，逃税最少的日丰，其少报税额占自报额的百分之四十五·二。这与去年九月份上海市财政报告中写的：“进行了一系列的取消假账工作，而且做到了取消假账。”的情况，恰恰成了一个相反的对比。
    上海严重的逃税现象，已经使得“自报实缴”的征收方法不能再继续下去。此一使得国家财政收入受到浩大损失的事实，已引起上海领导机关严重的注意，上海人民政府已指令税务局采取适当步骤，予以改正。
    （注一）这一材料为上海主要行业之统计，固不完全，与上海现有工商户数是有出入的。
    （注二）此数字系根据八月至十二月份的全部营业税入库税款金额为基础，（不包括行商税和营业税的罚金、迟纳金。）米数则以当时收款月份之平均米价计算，工商业户数系根据九二七六六户之材料。
    （注三）税捐负担包括印花税，车辆牌照等税在内，不包括营利事业所得税。
    （注四）去年上海征收营业税，每两月进行一次，在十二月份前入库的税额，均是第一、二期营业税的税收金额。
    （注五）因为本月份对过去因税率计算错误等原因，向工商业户退还税款，此“减”字表示为退款数。
