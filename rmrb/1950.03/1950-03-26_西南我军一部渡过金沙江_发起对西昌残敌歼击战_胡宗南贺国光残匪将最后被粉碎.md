Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 25th. A main force of the Southwest Military Region of our People's Liberation Army launched an歼击战 against the remnant enemy Hu Zongnan and He Guoguang bandit troops entrenched in the Xichang area in the middle of this month. It has now broken through the resistance of the remnant enemy in front and successfully crossed the natural barriers of the Jinsha River and Dadu River from the 21st to the 24th, occupying Huili, Ningnan, Hanyuan, Fulin, Kangding, Luding Iron Chain Bridge and other towns and important places, and is now advancing victoriously towards Xichang. After our People's Liberation Army concluded the Chengdu campaign, He Guoguang's bandit troops, the commander of the Chiang bandit Xichang Garrison, gathered remnants of defeated soldiers and generals, attempting to resist stubbornly to the death. Bandit Hu Zongnan also flew from Haikou to Xichang on January 28th. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek appointed bandit Hu as the director of the Southwest Administrative Office and bandit He as the deputy director, in order to command the Southwest remnant bandits and special agents, attempting to use that place as a base to continue their counter-revolutionary armed activities on the mainland. However, these death throes will inevitably be crushed in the end by the powerful advance of the People's Liberation Army.

　　西南我军一部渡过金沙江
    发起对西昌残敌歼击战
    胡宗南贺国光残匪将最后被粉碎
    【新华社重庆二十五日电】我人民解放军西南军区主力部队一部，于本月中旬发起对盘踞西昌地区残敌胡宗南、贺国光匪部之歼击战，现已击破当面残敌之抵抗，于二十一日至二十四日胜利渡过天险金沙江、大渡河，占领会理、宁南、汉源、富林及康定、泸定铁索桥等城镇、要地，现正乘胜向西昌进击中。按蒋匪西昌警备司令贺国光匪部自我解放军结束了成都作战以后，收容残兵败将，企图负隅作垂死顽抗。胡匪宗南亦于一月二十八日由海口飞西昌。蒋匪近更委胡匪为西南长官公署长官，贺匪为副长官，以指挥西南残匪特务，企图以该处为基点，继续其在大陆的反革命武装活动。然而，这些垂死挣扎，在强大人民解放军进击下，必将最后被粉碎。
