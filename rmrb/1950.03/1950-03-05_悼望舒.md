　　In Memory of Wang Shujun
    Bian Zhilin
    Wang Shujun's sudden death makes me feel most sorrowful because he was unable to fully display his talents under the constraints of the old society. Now that he was about to greatly display his talents for the new society, it is suddenly too late!
    Because he was eager to be able to work well, he wanted to cure his chronic asthma. He tried all sorts of methods without success, so he sought surgical treatment. The People's Government, unlike the reactionary regimes of the past, cherishes its staff and repeatedly gave him opportunities that were beyond the economic means of ordinary intellectuals, fulfilling his wish. However, the more effort he put in, the more problems arose. Because he was unwilling to stay in the hospital for a few more days, eager to return to the living among people and to work, he went out of the hospital and back in, back in and out again, and the more urgent he was, the more serious his condition became. Such misfortune is even more worthy of grief.
    Wang Shujun and I were on the same boat north around this time last year. Last year, when I returned from England, I met him in Hong Kong. I heard him say that he was determined to come to the liberated areas, which did not surprise me, although he had always been a bit accustomed to comfort, was able to live well in Hong Kong, and his asthma seemed very severe, seemingly unsuitable for a long journey. In the days before his departure, his asthma was acting up. When he brought two little girls to the hotel, he couldn't even climb the stairs to the first floor. When he got to the room, he was so breathless that he couldn't even sort out his luggage. That night, his wife, from whom he was separated only because of different lifestyles, came to the hotel to see him. They seemed to have good feelings for each other, but he was still determined. His wife wanted to leave the second child in Hong Kong, but he insisted on not agreeing. He gasped all night, but he was still so happy when he boarded the ship the next day! Looking back now, it seems as if he foresaw that he was going to die and was determined to come and see the liberated Beijing.
    Well, to be able to personally greet Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party moving to Beijing in Xiyuan before his death, and to witness the birth of the new China, he was really more fortunate than many people. And more comforting is this: Originally, as long as a person dedicates himself to meaningful and promising work, regardless of the size of the work, regardless of how much work is completed or even if it is only started, regardless of whether one's name will be left with the work, death is really not dying. Moreover, Wang Shujun's talent was not completely wasted in the past: his poems are still worthy of our historical measurement and critical evaluation, although that will be more useful when our new literature on a new foundation has grown to maturity and we look back. Therefore, at present, we should look more to the front, promote our multifaceted and common work, which is also promoting his life. As long as we have a breath, we will do more work, because when a person dies, we can only, like him, hand over the work to others.

　　悼望舒
    卞之琳
    望舒的忽然逝世最令我觉得悼惜的是：他在旧社会的束缚下未能把他的才能好好的施展，现在正要为新社会大大的施展他的才能了，却忽然来不及了！
    他因为急于要能够好好的工作，所以要把已成宿疾的哮喘病治好，尝试了一切办法都不见效，于是求之于割治，而人民政府，不比过去的反动政权，爱顾自己的工作人员，一再给了他一般文化人经济能力所办不到的机会，成全他的愿望，结果愈费劲反而愈成问题。他因为不肯在医院里多躺几天，急于要回到活生生的人中间，要做事，以致出院又进院，进院又出院，愈迫切反而愈造成病势的严重。这样的不幸更值得悲悼。
    我和望舒去年差不多这时候正是同船北来的。我去年从英国回来，路过香港，碰见他，听他说决心要来解放区，我并不惊讶，虽然他向来有点习惯于舒服，在香港也很能过日子，而且他的哮喘病显得很厉害，似乎不宜于远行。临走那几天他的哮喘正在发作，带了两个小女孩到旅馆的时候，连一层的楼梯都爬不上，到了房间里，又喘得连一些行李都不能清点。当晚他的只因生活方式不同而分开了的太太赶到旅馆来看他，他们之间显得感情还很好，可是他主意还是很坚决，太太想把第二个孩子留在香港，他还是坚持不答应。当夜他喘了一夜，第二天上船还是那么高兴！现在回想起来，真好像他预感到要死了，定要赶来看一看解放了的北京。
    也罢，能在瞑目前亲自到西苑迎见了毛主席和中共中央的搬来北京，目睹了新中国的诞生，他实在已经比多少人有幸了。而更可慰者：本来一个人只要献身给了有意义也就有前途的工作，不管工作大小，不管工作完成了多少或者甚至于做开了头没有，不管自己会跟工作留下留不下名字，死也实在死不了的，何况望舒的才能在过去也没有完全浪费：他的诗作还值得我们作历史的衡量和批判的估价，虽然那还是等到我们新基础上的新文学长得成熟到一个时候了再回顾头来看才更有用处。因此目前我们还是多向前面看，多推进我们多方面而又共同的工作，也就是推进他的生命。我们一息尚存，就多做一分工作，因为到人一死，我们就只能像他一样，把工作交给旁人去做了。
