Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th (TASS): A commentator in *Red Star* cites new facts proving the activities of the United States, Britain, and France in dividing Germany. The commentator points out that just three weeks ago, France and the "government" of the Saar region signed the so-called "Saar Agreement" – an agreement that German democrats consider a new and terrible act of power politics by Western countries against the German people. German democratic newspapers report that the ruling groups in the West are also plotting further plans to divide Germany, and some parts of Germany will soon be merged with Denmark as compensation for Denmark giving the United States several naval and air bases.

The broad masses of the German people are extremely angered by the recent new order from the British occupation authorities regarding the "temporary modification" of the German-Belgian and German-Dutch borders.

Western countries are also attempting to establish a so-called "Southwest State," and they want to separate Waldenburg-Hohenzollern and South Baden (French zone) as well as Waldenburg-Baden (American zone) from Germany.

The commentator said that the plan to establish a hybrid state subservient to the United States has been expressed by the United States several times through local separatist factions, vile German lackeys in the service of the United States.

The purpose of these actions by Western countries is to eliminate Germany as an independent state. Western countries have violated the Potsdam Agreement and the basic principles of international law. They are dividing the West German region among themselves. This policy of theft and plunder of power, which absolutely violates the interests of the German people, has a definite purpose: to incite revanchist tendencies and war psychosis in West Germany, and to create a new threat to peace and the security of European countries.

　　美英法违反波茨坦协定
    盗劫掠夺西德地区
    红星报著文列举事实揭露
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：《红星报》评论员举出新的事实，证明美英法三国分裂德国的活动。评论员指出，仅仅三个星期之前，法国与萨尔区的“政府”签订了所谓“萨尔协定”——德国民主人士认为是西方国家对付德国人民的一个新的可怕的强权统治的协定。德国的民主报纸报道，西方国家的统治集团还正在阴谋策划瓜分德国的进一步的计划，德国有些地方不久将归并给丹麦，作为对丹麦给了若干海军和空军基地与美国使用的报偿。
    广大的德国人民对于新近英国占领当局关于“暂时修改”德比与德荷边界的新命令，非常激怒。
    西方国家还在企图建立一个所谓“西南国家”，他们想把瓦登堡——霍亨索伦与南巴登（法占区）以及瓦登堡——巴登（美占区）从德国割离出来。
    评论员说，建立一个服从美国的混合种国家的计划，已经由美国几次三番通过当地分立派中美国手下的卑鄙的德国走狗们表示出来。
    西方国家这种行动的目的，在于取消德国为一个独立国家。西方国家违反了波茨坦协定，违反了国际法的基本原则，他们在自伙儿瓜分西德的地区。这一个绝对违反德国人民利益的盗劫与掠夺强权的政策，有一个确定的目的，即是在西德煽动复仇主义倾向和战争心理，并造成一种对和平和欧洲各国安全的新威胁。
