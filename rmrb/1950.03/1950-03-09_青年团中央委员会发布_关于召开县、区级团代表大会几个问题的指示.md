Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th:

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued instructions on several issues concerning the convening of county and district level congresses of the League. The full text is as follows:

　　The work of the Communist Youth League in rural areas of old and semi-old liberated areas is being actively carried out. Some counties and districts have already convened League congresses; some counties and districts are either preparing to convene them. The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League hereby raises several issues for the reference of various localities:

　　(1) The county and district League congress is the highest authority of the League in that county or district. The congress is responsible for reviewing and determining the work of the League; resolving, through democratic means, the main problems that the broad masses of young people urgently demand to be resolved in current work; electing the League committee to strengthen the League's leadership and advance the League's work; and uniting the broad masses of young people to carry out the youth movement. The convening of the congress should proceed from the actual needs of work development. The general principle is that it should be convened when the following conditions are met: the county or district has leading cadres of the League; the work of the lower-level League has a considerable foundation (the convening of the district congress requires that League branches have been established in more than one-third of the administrative villages); and the League has a certain influence among the young people. Timely convening of the congress under these conditions will better embody the spirit of democratic centralism in the League's internal life, which is the source of the League's vitality. However, if the above conditions are not met, it is not advisable to convene the congress.

　　(2) Regarding the election of representatives, the administrative village League branch should be the election unit. Each county and district may stipulate the number of representatives according to the number of League members in the area. The general quota for the district League congress is appropriate at fifty to seventy people. Larger districts can increase this to about one hundred people; if the number is too small, the representation will not be sufficient, and if the number is too large, the congress will not be easy to conduct well. Among the rural League member representatives, a certain number of young women representatives should participate; the League's county and district committees leading high primary school League branches should also elect representatives to attend; and a certain number of young party members and non-League youth activists from villages where League organizations have not been established should be invited to attend the meeting, acknowledging their right to criticize and make suggestions regarding the work and organization of the League, so as to gather ideas and fully promote the spirit of democracy.

　　(3) Sufficient deliberation and preparation should be carried out before the congress is convened. This is a prerequisite for holding a good congress. Through various meetings and activities before the congress, the nature, tasks, role, qualifications of representatives, and their rights and obligations should be universally and deeply discussed and educated among branch League members and the youth masses, so that League members can widely put forward proposals and opinions. The leading organs of counties and districts should make full preparations for the congress report, typical materials, and proposals; and should first ask the party committee at the same level and the League committee at the higher level to review them. Oppose the empiricist approach of no preparation and no leadership.

　　(4) The meeting should focus on the center and clearly solve one or two problems that the current work and the youth masses urgently need to solve (such as production, study, organizational construction, the League's work style, etc.). It is not appropriate or possible to list all the League's problems equally, regardless of their importance and urgency, and attempt to solve them all in one meeting.

　　(5) The meeting should fully promote the spirit of democracy, so that representatives can freely express their opinions, discuss issues, and put forward suggestions and criticisms of leading personnel. Representatives have the right to agree, doubt, oppose, or reserve their opinions; the principles of high democracy and high concentration should be combined with each other, and a unified resolution should be made using a voting system of the minority obeying the majority. The reports made by the heads of the League at all levels should be concise and to the point, and the time for meeting discussions should be greater than the time for reports. The presidium should seriously discuss and humbly consider the opinions and proposals of the representatives. Good opinions should be adopted, and for those that cannot be done or are incorrect, explanations should be given, and they should not be handled carelessly.

　　(6) The election of the League committee by the congress should be fully deliberated and discussed beforehand. The principles of election should take into account full-time youth cadres, the Democratic Women's Federation, government education departments, prestigious League branch secretaries, and outstanding League members among primary school teachers. The election should be carried out seriously and solemnly, and it is not enough to simply introduce the list of candidates. The election results should be reported to the higher level for approval, and the congress should instruct the representatives to go back and conscientiously convey the resolutions and implement them, opposing the practice of making resolutions but not acting on them.

　　(7) To hold a good League congress, the leadership must grasp three links: first, prepare well; second, lead the meeting well; and third, implement well (turn the resolutions into the actual actions of the broad masses). At the same time, the League congress should be scheduled as a routine meeting according to the agricultural season and the development of work, and cultivate a democratic habit among League cadres.

　　(8) In order to hold good county and district congresses, absorb experience, and educate cadres, the higher-level League committee should personally lead one or two key county and district congresses, and then gradually convene them in other counties and districts. Under normal circumstances, the district League congress should first be held in accordance with the above opinions, and then the county League congress should be convened in a timely manner according to the development and needs of each county's work.

　　(9) The important resolutions of the lower-level League congress should be submitted to the higher-level League organization for approval before they can be implemented. The higher-level League organization has the right to amend the resolutions of the lower-level organization's congress, or to suspend the execution of all or part of these resolutions.

### 青年团中央委员会发布  关于召开县、区级团代表大会几个问题的指示

　　青年团中央委员会发布
    关于召开县、区级团代表大会几个问题的指示
    【新华社北京八日电】新民主主义青年团中央委员会于三月七日发布关于召开县、区级团代表大会几个问题的指示。全文如下：
    各地老区和半老区农村青年团的工作正在积极开展，有的县、区已经召开了团的代表大会；有的县区或正在准备召开。中国新民主主义青年团中央委会员特提出几个问题，供各地参考：
    （一）青年团县、区的团员代表大会是该县、区团的最高权力机关。代表大会负责审查与确定团的工作；经过民主方式解决当前工作中与广大青年群众所迫切要求解决的主要问题；选举团的委员会，以加强团的领导和推进团的工作；团结广大青年，开展青年运动。代表大会的召开，应以工作发展的实际需要出发。一般的原则是具备了以下的条件才召开，即是：该县、区有了团的领导骨干；下级团的工作有了相当的基础（区代表会的召开，需要有三分之一以上的行政村已建立团支部）；团在青年群众中有了一定的影响。在这些条件下适时地召开代表大会，使团的内部生活，更好地体现民主集中制的精神，这是青年团生命力的源泉；但上述条件如不具备时，则不宜召开代表大会。
    （二）关于代表的产生，应以行政村团支部为选举单位。各县、区可根据该地区的团员人数规定代表名额，一般的区团代表大会名额以五十人至七十人为宜，较大的区可增至一百人左右；如人数过少则代表性不够，人数过多则大会不易开好。农村团员代表中，应有一定数量的青年妇女代表参加；团的县委、区委领导的高小团支部也应选代表出席；并应邀请一定数量的未建团的组织的村中青年党员和团外青年积极分子列席会议，承认他们对团的工作和组织有批评和建议之权，以便集思广益，充分发挥民主精神。
    （三）代表大会在召开以前应进行充分的酝酿和准备工作，这是开好大会的先决条件。通过会前的各种会议和各种方式的活动，把大会的性质、任务、作用、代表条件及其权利义务等问题，在支部团员和青年群众中进行普遍深入的民主讨论和宣传教育，使团员能广泛地提出提案和意见。县、区的领导机关应将大会的报告、典型材料、提案等，做充分准备；并事先应请同级党委和上级团委审阅。反对无准备无领导的经验主义的做法。
    （四）会议应抓住中心，明确地解决当前工作与青年群众所迫切需要解决的一两个问题（如生产、学习、组织建设、团的作风等）。如果不分轻重缓急，平列团的一切问题，企图在一次会议中都得到解决，这是不应该与不可能的。
    （五）会议应充分发扬民主精神，使代表能够自由发表意见、讨论问题、提出建议和批评领导人员。代表有赞成、怀疑、反对或保留意见之权利；应把高度民主和高度集中的原则互相结合起来，采用少数服从多数的表决制度，做出统一的决议。各级团的负责人所做报告，要剪头去尾，开门见山，力求简明；会议讨论的时间应多于报告的时间。主席团对代表意见和提案，应认真讨论、虚心考虑，好的意见要采纳，对于不能办到或不正确的意见，须加以解释和说明，不能潦草从事。
    （六）代表大会对团的委员会的选举，事前应进行充分的酝酿和讨论。选举的原则应照顾到专职青年干部、民主妇联、政府教育部门和有威信的团支部书记以及小学教员中的优秀团员。选举应认真严肃地进行，只是简单地介绍候选人名单是不够的。选举结果应报上级批准，大会要责成各代表回去认真传达决议并贯彻执行，反对决而不行的作风。
    （七）开好团代表大会，领导上要掌握三个环节：第一准备好；第二会议领导好；第三贯彻好（把决议变为广大群众的实际行动）。同时要按农业季节和工作发展的情况，将团代表大会定为例会，在团员干部中养成一种民主习惯。
    （八）为了开好县、区代表大会，吸收经验，教育干部，上级团委应亲自领导一二个重点县、区代表大会，然后在其他县、区逐渐召开。一般情况下，应首先按上述意见开好区级团代表大会，然后根据各县工作的发展与需要，再适时地召开县级团代表大会。
    （九）团的下级代表大会的重要决议，应呈报团的上级组织批准后方可执行。团的上级组织有权修改下级组织代表大会的决议，或停止这些决议的全部或部分的执行。
