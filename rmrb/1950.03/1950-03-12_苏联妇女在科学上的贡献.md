　　Soviet Women's Contributions to Science
　　Thousands of Soviet women are engaged in research work in the Soviet Academy of Sciences, higher education institutions, and laboratories. Female scientists, engineers, technicians, and agriculturalists are enriching Soviet science with their investigations, inventions, and discoveries, adding to its glory.
　　Among the scientific workers of the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone, approximately 40 percent are women, half of whom have obtained doctoral and master's degrees in science.
　　The recently published list of Stalin Prize winners includes many women's names who have made significant contributions to science and invented outstanding and innovative methods in industry and agriculture. Since the establishment of the Stalin Prize, 150 female scientists and pioneers in production movements have been awarded this prestigious prize.
　　Soviet women have earned a glorious position in physics and mathematics. Professor Pelageya Kochina, a Stalin Prize winner and one of the few female scientists renowned for her research in mechanics and mathematics, continues to advance the ideals of the distinguished Soviet female scientist Sofia Kovalevskaya in her work.
　　Historians are proud of their talented female colleagues Anna Pankratova and Militsa Nechkina.
　　The great Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov's outstanding successor is Doctor of Physiology Anna Dongikha, who has enriched Soviet science with important new discoveries in higher nervous activity. Olga Vorobyeva, repeatedly awarded prizes by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is famous for her research into the natural resources of the Kola Peninsula.
　　Currently, nearly a thousand young women are studying in the postgraduate programs of the Academy of Sciences, preparing for scientific research work.

　　苏联妇女在科学上的贡献
    数以千计的苏联妇女在苏联科学院、高等教育机关和实验室里从事研究工作。女科学工作者、女工程师、女技师和女农业家们，以她们的调查研究、发明和发现来丰富苏联科学，添加苏联科学的光荣。
    仅在苏联科学院科学工作者当中，就有百分之四十左右是女性，其中有一半获得了科学的博士和硕士学位。
    最近发表的斯大林奖金获得者的名单中，便有许多对科学有很大贡献的和在工农业中发明了卓越而新创的方法的女性的名字。自从斯大林奖金设立以来，已有一百五十位女科学家和生产运动中的女开路先锋获得了这一崇高的奖金。
    苏联妇女已在物理和数学方面赢得了光荣的地位，伯拉吉雅·科契娜教授，一位斯大林奖金的获得者，并且是机械和数学方面以研究工作著称的少数女科学家之一，在她的工作中继续发挥苏联卓越女科学家索菲亚、科瓦列夫斯卡雅的理想。
    历史学家们对他们天才的女同道安娜·潘克拉托娃和米利齐亚、尼契基娜，引以为荣。
    伟大的苏联生理学家伊凡·巴夫洛夫的优秀继承者便是生理学博士安娜·董基哈，她在高级神经活动方面获得了重要新发现，从而丰富了苏联科学。以对可拉半岛天然财富进行的调查研究而闻名的便是一再获得苏联科学院奖金的奥尔加·伏罗比耶娃。
    现在，将近有一千女青年正在科学院的研究班里攻读，准备作科学研究工作。
