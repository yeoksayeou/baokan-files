　　Eagerly Awaiting Liberation: The People of Tibet
    —Northwest Travelogue, Part 6
    By Our Correspondent Li Wen
    I have visited Tangke Lama several times, who recently returned from Lhasa, Tibet. Tangke is from Labrang and studied Buddhism at Sera Monastery and Ganden Monastery in Lhasa for seven or eight years. He is an ordinary lama, and his observations do not represent the full picture of Tibet. However, from the fragments he talked about, it can be seen that British imperialism is trying its best to invade Tibet, colluding with a few Tibetan traitors, and cruelly plundering the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people are suffering greatly and eagerly yearning for liberation.
    Tangke told me, "Alus Tsongwo province, Ula dougu, lao ren lao ren ji e ren" (Tibetan, meaning that British imperialism oppresses the Tibetan people, and it is obvious that it is getting worse year by year). In the Lhasa market, in addition to local products such as fur and musk, most of the cloth, felt blankets, and pulu are British goods. British merchants buy Tibetan people's silver at low prices, mix it with fake materials to make jewelry and other items, and then sell them to the Tibetan people at high prices to make huge profits. Tangke had been to Gyantse and Yatung (both are on the main route from Lhasa and Shigatse to India). From Gyantse, traveling southwest for four or five hundred li to Yatung (southern Tibet), there is a post and telegraph station every fifty li, all stationed with British Indian troops. British imperialism also established a military training corps in Gyantse to train Tibetan officers and soldiers to suppress the Tibetan people. The commands for training troops are all in English, and the uniforms are also British style. Last spring, Britain openly dispatched about a thousand troops to be stationed in an area about twenty stations away southwest of Lhasa. Most of the instructors in the Tibetan army are British, and British instructors and Tibetan officers can arbitrarily commit violence against the Tibetan people. When Tibetan people encounter British instructors and Tibetan officers, they must stand on the side of the road, bowing and holding one hand behind their back, scratching their face with the other hand, sticking out their tongue, nodding, and acting frightened. Otherwise, British instructors or Tibetan officers will beat and kick them. These facts fully demonstrate how rampant British imperialist elements and their lackeys are in Tibet, oppressing the Tibetan people!
    The Tibetan people have made many heroic resistances against the barbaric acts of aggression by British imperialism. As early as 1944, British imperialism colluded with certain pro-British traitors in Tibet in an attempt to establish British schools in Tibet, which aroused fierce opposition from lamas of the three major monasteries, including Sera, and the vast number of Tibetan people, forcing British imperialism to abandon the school base that had been built. The leading figure of Sera Monastery, Reting Rinpoche, who was highly respected throughout Tibet, saw the intensification of British aggression against Tibet and that Tibet was increasingly moving away from the motherland, so he secretly sent representatives to the mainland for help. The corrupt and incompetent Kuomintang reactionary government did not dare to offend the British Empire and ignored it. Patriotic people headed by Reting who opposed British imperialism's invasion of Tibet have since been severely persecuted, and the British Empire and its running dogs are eager to murder Reting. In January 1947, they first poisoned Labuxiu, the father of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who was friendly with Reting. In April, pro-British traitors such as Lhalu Gagarn (who had studied in England) forged documents accusing Reting of rebelling against the Tibetan government, while Lhalu led troops to Reting Monastery (a khangtsen belonging to Sera Monastery) to arrest Reting and take him to Lhasa for imprisonment. This incident caused a great uproar among the people of the Tibetan area and armed resistance from the monks of Reting Monastery. Lhalu and others mobilized more than 3,000 Tibetan troops to encircle and suppress Reting Monastery. After 13 days of hard fighting, the resistance forces ran out of ammunition and food due to the disparity in strength. The monastery was breached, killing 80 to 90 monks and capturing dozens of people. All the treasures and wealth of the monastery were looted. The armed resistance of the monks of Reting Monastery was suppressed, but it left greater resentment among the Tibetan people in the entire region and exposed the brutal and shameless true colors of imperialism and a few traitors. Reactionaries gouged out Reting's eyes and then poisoned him to death. However, in order to appease the anger of the vast number of Tibetan people, the reactionaries had to display Reting's remains and offer sacrifices for three days in accordance with Tibetan customs.
    After the Reting incident, a few pro-British elements completely controlled the Tibetan government, and the exploitation of the Tibetan people became even more severe. Slightly wealthy families had to pay 100 silver dollars or 100 dou of highland barley in tax at a time. Even poor Tibetans who lived by begging had to pay a burden of two or three dou of highland barley every year. A wealthy businessman in Lhasa named Hacha, who was a friend of Tangke, had business firms in Kangding in Xikang and India, and owned more than 500 cattle and horses. Because he did not know how to deal with officials, he was forced into bankruptcy under heavy tax extortion. The business firms and cattle and horses were all sold, leaving only a few broken houses. Zhaxi, who once lived in a courtyard with Tangke, originally had 15 cattle and more than 100 sheep. His younger brother was conscripted into the army and ran away, and all his family property was confiscated. Now the whole family lives by begging. This is not an isolated example. In Tibet, there are particularly many people who live by begging. Every year before and after the lunar New Year, there is an endless stream of beggars in front of the major monasteries in Lhasa, sometimes in batches of hundreds or thousands. Lamas have a higher status in Tibetan society and live better lives, but most lamas only eat three meals of "tsampa" a day and rarely get to eat butter.
    Tangke made a vivid comparison between Lhasa and Labrang after liberation, saying: In Lhasa, a catty of butter costs two or three silver dollars, and one silver dollar can buy six or seven catties of highland barley; in Labrang after liberation, one silver dollar can buy six catties of butter or about thirty catties of highland barley. Why are prices in Lhasa so expensive? Tangke said, "Because they can't stand the exploitation, many local Tibetans flee to other places, and the fields are deserted; some have their doors sealed because they can't pay the burden; many lands are forcibly occupied by the army, the land is badly cultivated, and the grain harvest is reduced; taxes and donations are high, and fewer merchants from Xikang and other places come to do business. Prices are particularly expensive, and the lives of the common people are particularly difficult."
    The most severe exploitation of the Tibetan people comes from the Tibetan army trained by British instructors. Wherever these troops are stationed, the local people are in great trouble. Tibetan soldiers can rape women in Tibetan people's homes at will. If anyone in the family objects or disagrees, they are in danger of being beaten to death. The Tibetan people have no choice but to swallow their tears. What the Tibetan people fear most is "Ula" (corvée). The local people in the garrison are often forced to feed horses, repair houses, cook... A "Jiuben" (equivalent to a squad leader) in the Tibetan army needs a cook, and a "Dingben" (platoon leader) needs a cook and a groom. Women braid the hair and wash clothes for the officers' wives, and if it is hot, they also have to plant trees and grow flowers for the officers. Tibetan people who cannot hide in time when the army arrives often have to do "Ula" for half a month or even dozens of days, and the whole family has to bring their own food. Officers often take the opportunity of military transport to arbitrarily ask the people for horses and cattle, or ask the people for money at a discounted price. Officers often visit various places, extorting money from the masses, which is very serious. When a Daiben (regimental commander) sets off, he asks the people for more than a thousand cattle and hundreds of horses. When officers above the Jia Ben (company commander) march, the local people must set up luggage upon hearing the news, such as door curtains, awnings, wall cloths, and Tibetan red felt on the bed. In fact, these officers have their own luggage, but they don't use any of it, they just let the masses offer money, and if they are not prepared in advance, they will be beaten and severely reprimanded.
    The reactionary elements in Tibet have spread various rumors to slander the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. However, lamas who went to Tibet from Mongolia to worship Buddha spread the scene of Mongolia after liberation, so the Tibetan people secretly prayed: "Let the People's Liberation Army come soon!" Tibetan people who still have doubts about the People's Liberation Army and the Communist Party, because they have suffered so much from the reactionary Tibetan army, speculate: "When will the Liberation Army come? No matter what, it will always be better than the current army!"

　　急盼解放的西藏人民
    ——西北旅行通讯之六
    本报记者  力文
    我曾数次造访刚从西藏拉萨归来的堂克喇嘛。堂克是拉卜楞人，在拉萨色拉寺、噶丹寺学佛七八年。他是一个普通喇嘛，他的见闻，不是西藏的全貌。但从他所谈到的片断事实中，也可看出英帝国主义在千方百计的侵略西藏，勾结西藏少数卖国分子，残酷的掠夺西藏人民。西藏人民苦痛不堪，渴望着早日得到解放。
    堂克告诉我：“阿鲁斯氽吾省、乌拉豆骨、老忍老忍吉额忍”（藏语，大意为英帝国欺压西藏人民，明显的可以看出一年比一年厉害了）。在拉萨的市面上，除皮毛、麝香等本地特产外，无论布匹、毡毯、氆氇多数是英国货。英国的商人以贱价收买藏民的银子，掺上假料制成首饰等物品，再以高价卖给藏民，谋取厚利。堂克曾到过江孜、亚东（二地均在拉萨、日喀则二大城市通印度的要道上）等地。从江孜西南行四五百里至亚东（西藏南境），每五十里有一邮电站，均驻有英印军队。英帝国主义并在江孜设有军事训练团，培养镇压西藏人民的藏军官兵。而操训部队的口令，全用英语，服装也是英国式。去年春天，英国更公开的派遣了约一千名的军队，驻扎在拉萨西南二十站路程的一带地方。西藏军队中的教官多数为英国人，英国教官和藏民军官，可随意对藏民行凶。藏民遇到英国教官和藏人军官，必须侧立道旁，一面弯腰鞠躬，一面是一手放背后，一手抓脸挠腮，伸舌头，点着头，作害怕状。不如此，英国教官或藏人军官对他们便是一阵拳打脚踢。这些事实，充分的说明了英帝国主义分子及其走狗们，在西藏是怎样的横行无忌欺压藏民了！
    西藏人民对于英帝国主义的野蛮侵略行为，曾经有过多次英勇的反抗。早在一九四四年，英帝国主义勾通西藏某些亲英的卖国分子，试图在西藏开办英国学校，曾引起以色拉等三大寺的喇嘛及广大藏民的激烈反对，迫使英帝国主义把已筹筑的校基自行毁弃。色拉寺的领导人物，在全藏声望极高的热振活佛，看到英帝对西藏侵略的加紧，西藏日益离开祖国，遂秘密派代表赴内地求援，腐败无能的国民党反动政府不敢触犯英帝，却置之不理。以热振为首的反对英帝侵略西藏的爱国人士，从此受到严重的迫害，英帝及其走狗并亟图谋杀热振。至一九四七年一月，首先毒死了与热振友好的达赖十四世的父亲拉布秀。四月间，拉鲁噶伦（曾留学英伦）等亲英卖国分子，一面伪造热振反叛藏政府的证件，一面由拉鲁率军赶赴热振寺（属于色拉寺的一个孔仓）逮捕热振，解至拉萨下狱。这一事件，引起了藏区人民大哗与热振寺僧众的武装反抗。拉鲁等又调集三千余藏军围剿热振寺，苦战十三日，终因众寡悬殊，反抗武装弹尽粮绝，寺被攻破，杀戮寺僧八九十人，俘数十人，全寺珍品财富被抢劫一空。热振寺僧众的武装反抗被镇压下去了，但在全区藏民中留下更大的愤恨，与暴露了帝国主义及少数卖国分子的凶残无耻的真面目。反动分子剜去热振的双目，再加以毒死。但反动分子为和缓广大藏民的愤怒，又不得不依照藏俗，展陈热振遗尸，并使受祭三日。
    热振事件后，少数亲英分子完全控制了西藏政府，对藏民的压榨更加厉害了。稍富有之家，一次即需缴税一百块银洋或一百斗青棵。贫苦藏民即使是讨饭为生，每年也要出二三斗青棵的负担。拉萨有个名叫哈查的富商，是堂克的朋友，他在西康的康定和印度均设有商号，拥有五百多头牛马。因为他不会结交官场，在重税勒索下，被迫破产了。商号和牛马都变卖了，只剩下几间破房。曾和堂克在一个院落住过的扎喜，原有十五头牛，百多只羊，弟弟被征去当兵又偷跑回家，他的家财便全部被没收了。现在全家人以讨饭为生。这不是个别例子。在西藏，讨饭为生的人特别多，每逢阴历年前后，拉萨的各大寺门前，讨饭的人群络绎不绝，有时一批多至数百人或千余人。喇嘛在藏区社会中，地位较高，生活也较好，但大多数喇嘛一天也只是三顿“糌粑”充饥，很少吃得到酥油。
    堂克把拉萨与解放后的拉卜楞作了一个生动的对照，他说：拉萨是一斤酥油价银洋二三元，一个银洋买六七斤青棵；在解放后的拉卜楞，一块银洋能买六斤酥油或三十斤左右的青棵。拉萨的物价为啥这样贵呢？堂克说：“受不住压榨，本地不少藏民出外逃荒，田地荒芜了；有的因为纳不起负担，门被查封了；不少土地被军队强占，地种的坏，粮收的少了；税大捐大，西康等外地商人来做买卖的少了。物价格外贵，老百姓生活也就特别困难了。”
    对藏民压榨最厉害的，要算是由英国教官训练出来的西藏军队。这些军队住到那里，当地老百姓便大祸临头了。藏兵随便到藏民家中奸淫妇女，家中有人稍加反对或不同意，即有被打死的危险，藏民们只好饮泣吞声。藏民最头痛的是出“乌拉”（差役），驻地老百姓多被迫为军队喂马、修房、做饭……藏军中一个“久本”（相当班长）便要一个伙夫，一个“定本”（排长）便要伙夫马夫各一个。妇女们则给军官太太梳辫子、洗衣服，如果是在热天，还要给军官们栽树养花。军队来了不及躲藏的藏民，往往半月甚至数十天，全家都得出“乌拉”，还要自带食粮。军官们常借口军运，随便向老百姓要马要牛，或者折价向老百姓要钱。军官也常到各地游览，敲诈群众，非常厉害。一个代本（团长）出发，便向老百姓要千余头牛，数百匹马。甲本（连长）以上的军官行军，所到之处，当地群众必须闻讯设置行装，如门帘、天蓬、壁布、床上的藏褥红毡等物。其实这些军官均有自备行装，不用一物，只是让群众折钱供奉，如事先没有准备，就会遭到毒打与重斥。
    西藏的反动分子，曾散布各种谣言，诬蔑共产党与人民解放军。可是，从蒙古赴西藏朝佛的喇嘛，传播了蒙古解放后的光景，因之藏民暗中祈祷着：“人民解放军快来吧！”对人民解放军与共产党还抱怀疑态度的藏民，也因饱受西藏反动军队的糟践，他们揣测：“解放军什么时候来到呢？不论怎样，总会比现下的军队好！”
    一九五○年一月于拉卜楞
