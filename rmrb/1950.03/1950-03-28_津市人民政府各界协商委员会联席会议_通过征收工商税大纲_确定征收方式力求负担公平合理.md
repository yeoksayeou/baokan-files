Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee and the All-Circles Consultative Committee held their second joint meeting on the 25th. The meeting heard a briefing from Li Gengtao, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, regarding the spirit of the National Financial Conference in February, and passed the work outline for the collection of industrial and commercial tax for private industry and commerce in Tianjin for the second half of 1949. According to the provisions of the work outline, the task of collecting industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949 is 67.5 million jin of millet, the same as in the first half of the year. The appraisal and grading hypothetical score is still calculated as 2 million points. According to the provisions of the new tax law, the amount of tax reduction and exemption for industrial and commercial enterprises may increase to 10 percent. In order to ensure the completion of the tax revenue task, the amount of millet per point will be increased to 35 jin. In this way, the income reduced due to tax reduction and exemption can be partially compensated. Bi Mingqi, a member of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee, and Tan Zhiqin, a member of the Tianjin All-Circles Consultative Committee, spoke successively, advocating that the entire tax collection should adopt a democratic appraisal method, with the appraisal organization divided into two steps: joint appraisal by various industries and appraisal by the industry itself. They also proposed that the unfair burden between industries, and between large and small households within the industry, which occurred last time, should be prevented. The tax bureau can check the accounts when necessary in order to seek fair and reasonable burdens among each other. The above opinions were unanimously approved by the meeting. The appraisal work for industrial and commercial tax will be launched on the 27th, and efforts will be made to complete it all within ten days.

　　津市人民政府各界协商委员会联席会议
    通过征收工商税大纲
    确定征收方式力求负担公平合理
    【新华社天津二十六日电】天津市人民政府委员会与各界协商委员会，于二十五日举行第二次联席会议。会议听取了天津市人民政府财经委员会副主任李耕涛关于二月全国财政会议的传达，并通过了津市私营工商业一九四九年下半年度工商业税征收的工作大纲。根据该工作大纲规定，一九四九年下半年度的工商业税征收任务共为六千七百五十万斤小米，与上半年相同。评议假定分数仍按二百万分计算。根据新税法的规定，这次工商业减免税额可能增至百分之十。为了确保税收任务的完成，将每分折米数提高至三十五斤小米。这样，因减免而减少的收入可以得到部分补偿。天津市人民政府委员毕鸣岐、天津市各界协商会委员谭志清等相继发言，主张征税全部采用民主评议方式，评议组织分各业联合评议及本行评议两步骤；并提出应防止上次曾发生的行业与行业、行业内大小户之间负担不公的现象；税务局必要时可抽查账目，以求相互间负担的公平合理。上述意见，均经会议一致通过。工商业税的评议工作，将自二十七日起展开，争取于十日内全部完成。
