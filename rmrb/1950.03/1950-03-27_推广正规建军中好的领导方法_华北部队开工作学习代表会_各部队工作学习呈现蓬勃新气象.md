　　Promote Good Leadership Methods in Regular Army Building
    North China Troops Hold Work-Study Representative Conference
    Vigorous New Atmosphere Emerges in Work-Study in Various Units
    [Our Newspaper News] The method of convening work-study representative conferences (hereinafter referred to as work-study representative conferences) to promote political work in the regular army building, created by a certain unit of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, has now been gradually enriched and improved, and is being widely promoted in various units in North China. All units that have held such meetings have consolidated the relationship between leaders and the masses, discovered, united, and enhanced the vast number of activists, promoted the experiences created by the masses, carried forward the new heroism of the troops, cultivated heroes and models and cadres, and made work-study present a vigorous new atmosphere.
    Anyone with achievements and creativity in work or study can be elected as a representative to concentrate on mass creation and organize typical reports
    On September 10th last year, a certain regiment of the North China Military Region held its first work-study representative conference. The regiment stipulated that anyone who has made achievements or has creativity in a certain work or study can be elected as a representative to attend this meeting. The method of producing representatives is to first freely propose candidates by cadres and soldiers according to the conditions stipulated by the regiment, and then elect them by all comrades in the squad and platoon, pass them through the company, and approve them by the battalion. The number of representatives attending the regiment accounted for about one-tenth of the total number of the regiment, including activists from the entire regiment and representatives from all aspects. Each representative has a strength and has a close relationship with the masses.
    The vast majority of representatives are the leading forces and backbones in various tasks in the troops in the past. At the meeting, the representatives were divided into several groups according to work or problems (such as study groups, food improvement groups, etc.). First, group meetings were held, and each representative reported his model deeds; then the group selected representatives to make typical reports to the conference. After listening to the typical reports at the meeting, all the representatives checked their work and study according to the standards of the typical reports, and set out plans for future improvement. This meeting achieved very good results. It discovered and united activists from the entire regiment and representatives from all aspects, commended good typical examples, and improved the ambition of each representative; through the exchange of experiences in various aspects, it enlightened the representatives to improve their work and study methods; it also improved and enriched the leadership of the regiment. For example, squad leader Ren Huzi introduced his experience in using democratic centralism to lead the whole squad well, which largely solved the problem of squad leadership that the regiment had long felt difficult. This meeting was immediately supported by the masses. Before the meeting was over, the model deeds of the representatives spread throughout the regiment and to the friendly troops. Many squad leaders wrote to the regiment's work-study representative conference, expressing their willingness to learn from squad leader Ren Huzi, and friendly troops invited him to give reports. Ma Qing, a soldier in the first company, used to say that he was "stupid" and could not learn culture. After hearing about Cheng Baolan, a representative who studied hard for six weeks and learned more than two hundred characters, he immediately made up his mind to study and learned six new characters that night. After the meeting, the representatives returned to their companies and were warmly welcomed by the masses and encouraged by the leaders. They influenced the masses with their leading role, and widely publicized the model deeds of representatives in various aspects, and publicized the fact that the leading organs at all levels in the regiment valued the representatives and cherished everyone's experience, which greatly stimulated the ambition of the masses. Cadres and soldiers generally proposed: "Work hard and study hard, and strive to be a representative next time", which made the whole regiment look new.
    Conference experience is gradually promoted, the content is enriched, and the method is improved
    The success of the regiment's work-study representative conference attracted the attention of the superior leading organs and friendly troops. The military and division studied this experience, and the military political commissar went to Ren Huzi's squad in the regiment for investigation and research. The two brother regiments of the division also immediately convened work-study representative conferences. Last winter and this spring, many divisions and regiments successively convened work-study representative conferences, and enriched and improved the content and methods of the conferences: all units organized warm welcome and farewell to the representatives, which further increased the sense of honor of the elected representatives; the leading organs appropriately absorbed some typical people who were slow to progress or did not progress to attend the meeting, and motivated and drove the progress of this part of the people through them; at the meeting, the leading organs made brief special summaries based on the typical reports, pointed out the correct parts of the typical reports, and criticized certain wrong views; after the meeting, the leading organs also planned to organize the promotion of good work experience. For example, Wang Wenshan, a cook in a certain division, transformed the stove to save coal, reducing the amount of coal used to cook forty kilograms of rice from eight kilograms to one and four taels (Editor's note: The method of improving the stove was described in detail in the "People's Garden" of this newspaper on March 24), Wang Wenshan was elected as a work-study representative and introduced his method at the work-study representative conferences of the regiment and division. Then, each catering unit in the division sent representatives to Wang Wenshan's cooking squad for internship or asked him to give a report, and promoted the method of improving the stove to the whole division. In the past, the coal consumption of each catering unit generally exceeded the supply standard (some burned 300 kilograms a day, which was twice the supply standard). Now, the daily coal consumption of each unit generally dropped to about 64 kilograms, saving half of the supply standard, and improving the food of the whole division. Everyone reflected: the work-study representative conference can really solve problems.
    Widely promote work-study representative conferences
    North China Liberation Army Daily publishes editorial, military region instructs all departments to hold meetings on schedule
    On December 3rd last year, the Political Department of the North China Military Region, the "North China Liberation Army Daily" published an editorial entitled "Widely Promote Work-Study Representative Conferences", pointing out that this kind of conference is a good leadership method that comes from the masses and goes to the masses under the task of regular army building in a peaceful environment. The North China Military Region has officially stipulated in the instructions on this year's work that the division and regiment levels should hold work-study representative conferences regularly (every four months for the division and every two months for the regiment) to promote democracy, consolidate the relationship between leaders and the masses, carry out the new heroism movement, cultivate cadres and heroes and models, and establish a performance appraisal system on this basis, hold award evaluation at the end of this year, elect heroes and models, and hold a heroes and models conference.

　　推广正规建军中好的领导方法
    华北部队开工作学习代表会
    各部队工作学习呈现蓬勃新气象
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区某部创造的召开工作学习代表会议（以下简称工学代表会）以推进正规建军中的政治工作的方法，现已逐步充实提高，在华北各部队中广泛推行。凡开过这种会的部队，都巩固了领导与群众的联系，发现、团结与提高了广大的积极分子，推广了群众创造的经验，发扬了部队的新英雄主义，培养了英雄模范和干部，使工作学习呈现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    工作或学习上有成绩、有创造者，均可当选为代表集中群众创造组织典型报告
    去年九月十日，华北军区某团，首次召开了工学代表会。团里规定：凡是在某项工作或学习上有成绩、有创造者，都可以当选为出席此项会议的代表。代表产生的方法，是首先由干部、战士根据团里规定的条件自由提出候选人，经班、排全体同志选举、连通过、营批准。该团出席代表人数约占全团总人数的十分之一，包括了全团的积极分子与各方面的代表人。每个代表都有一点长处，并和群众有密切的联系。
    绝大部分代表是以往部队中各种工作中的带头力量与骨干分子。在会议上，各代表按工作或问题分成若干小组（如学习小组、改善伙食小组等），首先举行小组会，由每个代表报告自己的模范事迹；再由小组选出代表向大会作典型报告。全体代表听了大会典型报告后，再根据典型报告的标准，检查自己的工作和学习，定出今后改进的计划。这个会议获得了很好的成绩。发现与团结了全团的积极分子与各方面的代表，表扬了好的典型，提高了每个代表的上进心；通过各方面经验的交流，启示了各代表改进工作和学习的方法；同时也提高与充实了团的领导。如代表中的班长任胡子介绍了他运用民主集中制、领导好全班的经验，使团里长期感到困难的关于班的领导问题大体上获得了解决。这个会议立即得到了群众的拥护。会议还未开完，代表们的模范事迹就传遍了全团，并传到了友军。许多班长给团工学代表会来信，表示愿向代表中的班长任胡子学习，并有友军请他去作报告。一连战士马庆，以往常说自己“心笨”不能学文化，这次听到代表中的程宝兰苦学六周认字二百多的事迹后，立即下定决心学习，当天晚上就学会了六个生字。会后，代表们回到连队，受到群众的热烈欢迎与领导的鼓励，他们在工作和学习上更努力了。他们一面以自己的带头作用影响群众，一面广泛宣传各方面代表的模范事迹，宣传团内各级领导机关器重代表与珍视大家经验的情形，大大激发了群众的上进心。干部和战士们普遍提出：“努力工作学习，争取下次当代表”，使全团面貌为之一新。
    会议经验逐渐推广充实内容改进方法
    该团工学代表会的成功，引起了上级领导机关与友军的重视。军、师都研究了这一经验，军政治委员并就赴该团的任胡子班作调查研究。该师的两个兄弟团也立即召开了工学代表会。在去冬与今春，许多师团都相继召开了工学代表会。并充实与改进了会议的内容和方法：各部队对代表组织了热烈的欢迎欢送，更增加了当选代表的荣誉感；领导机关适当地吸收一些进步慢和不进步的典型性的人列席会议，通过他们来激励和带动这部分人的进步；在会议上，领导机关根据典型报告作简要的专题总结，指出典型报告中的正确部分，批判某些错误的见解；会后，领导机关并有计划地组织推广好的工作经验。如某师炊事员王文善改造炉灶节省烧煤，使煮熟四十斤米饭的用煤量由八斤降到一斤四两（编者按：此项改善炉灶的方法，本报三月二十四日“人民园地”曾有详细介绍），王文善即被选为工学代表，在团和师的工学代表会上介绍了他的方法。接着，全师各伙食单位都派代表到王文善炊事班实习或请他去作报告，把改善炉灶的方法推广到全师。各伙食单位以前烧煤普遍超过供给标准（有的一天烧到三百斤，超过供给标准一倍）。现在，各单位每日用煤普遍下降到六十四斤左右，较供给标准节省一半，改善了全师的伙食。大家反映：工学代表会真能解决问题。
    普遍推广工学代表会
    华北解放军报发表社论军区指示各部按期举行
    去年十二月三日，华北军区政治部“华北解放军报”曾以“普遍推广工学代表会”为题发表社论，指出这种会议是在和平环境正规建军任务之下，从群众中来到群众中去的一种好的领导方法。华北军区在关于今年工作的指示中，已正式规定师与团两级应定期（师四个月，团两个月）召开工作学习代表会议，以发扬民主，巩固领导与群众的联系，开展新英雄主义运动，培养干部与英雄模范，并在此基础上建立考绩制度，于今年年终举行评奖，选举英雄模范，召开英雄模范大会。
