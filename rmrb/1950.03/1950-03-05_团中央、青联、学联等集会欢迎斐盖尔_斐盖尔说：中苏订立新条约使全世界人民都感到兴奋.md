Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th: To welcome Léo Figuères, representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and Secretary-General of the French Republican Youth Union, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Youth Art Theater, the Central Youth League School, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League held a welcome meeting at the Youth Palace this morning. At the meeting, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, first delivered an opening speech, stating briefly: Comrade Figuères' overcoming all difficulties to come to China shows that no imperialist country in the world can stop the unity of the world's youth. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, in his welcome speech, described the long-standing friendship and close relationship between Chinese and French youth in history, and then pointed out that the victory of the Chinese youth under the leadership of Chairman Mao is inseparable from the struggle of the people and youth of the Soviet Union and the world. The Chinese youth will, under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, resolutely support the struggle of the youth of all oppressed nations, especially the youth of Southeast Asia, for democracy, peace, and independence. Figuères rose to speak amidst warm applause, saying that the victory of the Chinese revolution has strengthened the forces of democracy and peace in the world and inspired the people and youth of the world. The struggle of the Chinese people and youth is a good example for the people and youth of the world, especially in Southeast Asia. He said: French youth regard every victory of the Chinese people as their own victory. At present, the French people and youth are fighting against the North Atlantic Treaty and against the French reactionary government's war of aggression in Vietnam. Figuères especially praised the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, saying: All nations around the world are excited by the signing of this treaty. Figuères finally emphasized: The world's democratic youth, led by the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, are fighting towards the same goal, which is: defending peace and opposing war, as put forward by the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Figuères' speech was repeatedly drowned out by warm applause, and the venue was filled with the fraternal atmosphere of the big family of world democratic youth. After the meeting, the Youth Art Theater performed recreational programs.

    斐盖尔说：中苏订立新条约使全世界人民都感到兴奋
    【新华社北京四日电】为欢迎世界民主青年联盟代表、法国共和青年联盟总书记雷奥·斐盖尔，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、青年艺术剧院、中央团校和青年团北京市工委会于今日上午在青年宫举行欢迎会。会上首由全国青联主席廖承志致开会词，略称：斐盖尔同志冲破一切困难来到中国，表明世界上任何帝国主义国家，阻止不了世界青年的团结。青年团中央书记冯文彬在欢迎词中，叙述了中国青年和法国青年历史上的悠久友谊与密切关系，继即指出，现在中国青年在毛主席领导下，获得了胜利，这与苏联和全世界的人民与青年的斗争是分不开的。中国青年将在世界青联的旗帜下，坚决支援各被压迫民族青年特别是东南亚的青年为争取民主、和平与独立的斗争。斐盖尔在热烈掌声中起立讲话，他说，中国革命的胜利，加强了世界民主与和平的力量，并且鼓舞了全世界的人民和青年。中国人民和青年的斗争，对于全世界、特别是东南亚的人民与青年，是一个好榜样。他说：法国青年对中国人民的每一次胜利，都看做是自己的胜利。目前法国人民和青年，正在为反对北大西洋公约、反对法国反动政府在越南进行侵略战争而斗争。斐盖尔特别称赞中苏友好同盟互助条约，他说：全世界各民族都为这个条约的订立而感到兴奋。斐盖尔最后强调地说：在以苏联列宁共产主义青年团为首的全世界民主青年，是向着同一目标作斗争，这个目标就是世界青联第二次代表大会所提出的：保卫和平，反对战争。斐盖尔的讲话几次为热烈的掌声所淹没，会场里充满了世界民主青年大家庭里兄弟的友谊气氛。会后由青年艺术剧院表演游艺节目。
