　　Chahar Province Grain Depots Discover Corruption

[Our Newspaper Dispatches] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Corruption, embezzlement, and grain theft have been discovered in grain depots across Chahar Province, resulting in a total loss of over 30,000 catties of public grain. Those involved in corruption and embezzlement include: Bai Qinglin, deputy section chief of the Supply Section of the Yanbei District Depot, grain accountant Hai Zhou, and six others. Last year, they took advantage of the opportunity to purchase materials for building depots, falsely reported prices, loaned public funds to private individuals for speculative trading, and shared the profits, embezzling grain funds equivalent to over 5,000 catties of millet. Liu Yushan, director of the Yungang sub-depot in Datong County, and grain accountant Xiong Zhanheng, colluded to embezzle 2,000 catties of millet in November of last year. Dong Qingrong, a storekeeper at the Yanggao Central Sub-depot, and others stole 240 catties of public grain while guarding the warehouse at night in December of last year. Zhang Shouxi, an accountant at the Huairen County Central Sub-depot, absconded with 15,000 yuan of public funds, equivalent to 150 catties of millet at the time. Xi Yongding, an accountant at the Chahar South District Depot, embezzled 200 catties of millet. Lu Ziming, director of the Xuanhua Sub-depot, and two others embezzled grain funds equivalent to 1,000 catties of millet and 800 catties of sorghum. Xue Yu, an accountant at the Tianzhen Central Sub-depot, over-reported assistant expenses by 600 catties of millet and 280,000 yuan of public funds during the autumn grain collection, totaling 1,300 catties of millet. The storekeeper of the Kangbao County Miaolama Sub-depot and others colluded with the local militia company commander, stealing three large stones of grain in one night. These eight cases involve a total loss of over 10,000 catties of grain. With the exception of a few cases that are still under investigation, the relevant grain depot authorities have taken disciplinary actions against the corrupt and derelict personnel based on the severity of their offenses, including dismissal from their posts, investigation, criticism, education, and recovery of stolen goods. Furthermore, since the autumn grain collection, grain theft incidents have occurred in the Kangbao, Baoyuan, Duolun, Yanggao, Hunyuan, Zuoyun, Lingqiu, Kouquan, and other grain depots, resulting in a total loss of over 20,000 catties of public grain. The thieves are mostly local smokers and loafers. The majority have now been apprehended. In addition to the relevant authorities recovering the stolen grain, the thieves will be handed over to the local judicial departments for punishment and re-education.
