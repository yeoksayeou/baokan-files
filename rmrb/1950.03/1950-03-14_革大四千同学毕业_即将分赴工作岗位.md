　　Over Four Thousand Students Graduate from Revolutionary University, Soon to Depart for Work Posts
　　[Report from this newspaper] Over four thousand students from the second, third, and fourth divisions of the second term of the North China People's Revolutionary University, after six months of study, have victoriously completed their study tasks and will soon be dispatched (except for the fourth division) to various work posts. On the 11th of this month, the university held a grand graduation ceremony. At the meeting, the university's President Liu Lantao and Education Director Hou Weiyu gave speeches respectively, instructing the students on methods, styles, and attitudes for continued learning and working after graduation, which were warmly welcomed by the students. In his speech as a guest, former Vice President of Revolutionary University, Hu Xikui, gave extremely important instructions and encouragement to the students on the aspect of connecting with the masses and humbly learning from the masses. Finally, student representative Ju Kundao delivered a speech, representing all the students in guaranteeing unconditional obedience to organizational assignments, happily going to their work posts, and ensuring that they would do their work well, wholeheartedly serve the people, continue to learn in their work, learn what they don't know, and become good talents for building a new democratic society. Amidst enthusiastic applause and music, the graduating students presented gifts to their alma mater, including twelve red banners and a collection of books. The school also decided to give graduating students commemorative albums and books as souvenirs.
