　　*Profound Friendship*

    The play *Profound Friendship*, performed by the People's University Art Troupe (the story was introduced in yesterday's issue), vividly promotes the internationalist spirit of the working class and criticizes the narrow nationalist thinking of the bourgeoisie, represented by the college student Ren Qiuming, through factory life. Around this theme, it criticizes the empiricism and purely technical viewpoints of the old worker Bao Yonggang, while also affirming the role of experience and technology; it criticizes the simplistic "welfare" viewpoints that exist between some cadres and workers, while also pointing out that the improvement of workers' lives should be unified with the improvement of technology and the development of production. Furthermore, it clearly resolves issues such as the role of women in the restoration and development of production and the integration of intellectuals with the working class. The presentation and resolution of all these issues are mostly not based on abstract theories (lines), but conveyed to the audience through various living images. Therefore, this play has achieved a considerable degree of unity between ideological and artistic merit. In the characterization of the figures, it vividly highlights typical characteristics through a scientific development process (this is mainly reflected in the old worker Bao Yonggang). This is a major progress in plays reflecting the life of workers in the past year. And because the content of real life has developed more richly than a year ago, the ideological content expressed in this play is also richer than *Red Flag Song* and *How Shells Are Made*.

    However, this play also has some shortcomings. First – this is a common phenomenon in the current literary and art circles: the portrayal of the power of leadership is insufficient. Although it can be seen from the play that the playwright is subjectively trying to write the leadership better, this effort has not achieved the desired effect. This is specifically manifested in the fact that the factory director, Party, and Youth League secretaries can only use simple political principles to persuade the workers who, due to their habits with old technology and working methods, are skeptical and dissatisfied with the Soviet experts' plans and requirements, which seems empty and weak. If it could be further shown that these cadres, due to their lack of production knowledge, cannot determine who is right and who is wrong, and therefore learn from Soviet experts, learn from workers, and strive to study diligently; not only trust Soviet experts politically, but also have a scientific basis to adhere to leadership principles, then it would be able to better demonstrate the noble qualities and excellent work style of being responsible to the people and the Party, and more powerfully demonstrate the power of leadership. This would have more and greater educational significance for cadres working in enterprise departments.

    In addition, the handling of Guo Sujie, a retained employee, is seriously flawed in this play. This character appears before the audience in the play, and the author seems to only want to use her vulgarity and frivolity to add a bit of comedy; while neglecting that the appearance of this character is related to the Party and the People's Government's policy towards retained personnel, and she must be handled seriously. It is permissible to portray her backward side, but it is necessary to simultaneously show the Party's education, expectations, and care for such people, in order to conform to reality. However, what is shown in this play is that she is left to her own devices, and no one cares about her, which is very bad.

    This play should be widely performed in factories, or workers and cadres of enterprise departments should be organized to watch it in a planned way; the most ideal is to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings and make it into a film. Because the educational significance of this play is multifaceted.

　　《深厚的友谊》
    亚群
    人民大学文工团演出的《深厚的友谊》（故事内容昨日本刊已有介绍），透过工厂生活，具体地发扬了工人阶级的国际主义精神，批判了以大学生任秋明为代表的资产阶级的狭隘的民族主义思想。它环绕着这一主题，批判了老工人包永刚的经验主义和单纯的技术观点，也肯定了经验和技术的作用；批判了当前某些干部及工人间存在着的单纯的“福利”观点，也指出了工人生活的提高应当和提高技术发展生产统一起来。它并且，明确地解决了妇女在恢复和发展生产中的作用及知识分子与工人阶级结合等问题。所有这些问题的提出和解决，大部分不是乞灵于抽象的理论（台词），而是透过各种各样的生活形象而传达给观众的。因此，这个剧，思想性和艺术性是达到了相当程度的统一。在人物的刻画上，它是经过了科学的发展过程而鲜明地突出了典型性格的（这主要表现在老工友包永刚身上）。这是一年来反映工人生活的剧本的一大进步。也因为现实生活的内容比一年前发展得更其丰富，所以这个剧所表达的思想内容也较之《红旗歌》、《炮弹是怎样造成的》更其丰富。
    但是，这个剧还有一些缺点。首先——这是目前文艺界的普遍现象：表现领导的力量是不够的。虽是从剧中可以看出剧作者在主观上是努力想把领导写得更好，但这努力并未收到应有的效果。这具体表现在剧中的厂长、党、团书记，对于许多工人因习惯于旧的技术和工作方式而对苏联专家的计划和要求发生怀疑和不满的情绪，只能单纯地用政治上的大道理去说服，表现空泛无力。假如能进一步的表现出这些干部们因自己生产知识的不够，不能判明谁是谁非，于是向苏联专家学习，向工人们学习，努力钻研；不仅在政治上信赖苏联专家，而且有科学的根据，坚持领导原则，那就更能表现出对人民对党负责的高贵品质和优良作风，也就更有力地表现出了领导的力量。这对于企业部门工作干部的教育意义，将会更多更大。
    此外，在这个剧本中，处理留用人员郭素洁是有很大的缺陷的。这个人物在剧中出现在观众面前，在作者方面似乎只以她的庸俗、轻佻，想借此增加一点喜剧性；而忽略了这个人物的出场是有关党和人民政府对待留用人员的政策问题的，必须严肃地处理她。刻画她的落后的一面是可以的，但必需同时表现出党对这种人的教育、期望、爱护，才合乎实际。而这个剧中所表现的却是听其自流，谁也没有管她，这是非常不好的。
    这个剧应当普遍地在工厂中演出，或有计划地组织工人及企业部门的干部去看；最理想的是把上述的缺点改正过而制成影片。因为这个剧的教育意义是多方面的。
