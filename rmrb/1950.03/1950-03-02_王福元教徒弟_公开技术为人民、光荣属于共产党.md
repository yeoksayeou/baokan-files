　　Wang Fuyuan Teaches Apprentices
　　Open Technology for the People, Glory Belongs to the Communist Party
　　Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory, CCP General Branch
　　Wang Fuyuan is a maintenance foreman in the carding department of Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory. He is fifty years old and has thirty-nine years of experience. Over the years, he has worked in about ten factories, large and small, and has learned excellent skills, especially in covering carding machine fillets; he is the best in the entire factory. He is usually very kind to the workers in his department, but he is unwilling to teach his skills to others. When others ask him, he always says, "Old Wang has silver treasures that you can take; but this skill, I will take it to the grave with me when I die; I won't teach it to anyone." Therefore, the young workers all scold him for being "conservative." In fact, he has his reasons. He has no connections, no wealthy relatives. He has been able to survive in the old factories all these years solely because of his skills. People with connections but no skills may be able to climb above him, but they cannot squeeze him out because the factory needs his skills. He has seen through this point and thinks, "Everyone has selfish desires. My selfishness is just for my livelihood."
　　After liberation, at first, he still held the view that "everyone has selfish desires," burying himself in his work and ignoring everything else. But he gradually realized that times were different. In the past, senior staff members always looked at him sideways, only showing a better complexion when begging for his "skills." And him? He always had a somewhat humble and pitiful appearance. Especially when entering and leaving the factory, he would raise his hands, allowing people to search him all over like a thief. Now? Staff and workers are very kind and friendly to each other. And there are no more body searches when entering and leaving the factory. In his words, it was a strange experience.
　　In August, the Hai River flooded, and some parts of the factory were flooded with water. According to past practice, the higher authorities would simply issue an order and let the lower levels solve it. But now it was different. He saw the military representative of the factory barefoot, carrying his shoes, inspecting the entire factory. He was even more surprised. He thought, "Why don't these people have any selfish desires?" Later, he participated in the factory's political study class and finally understood the reason.
　　When the factory's Communist Youth League established a general branch, the members of the maintenance department invited him to attend the general branch's founding conference. At the meeting, the young people respected him very much and invited him to speak on the stage. He had lived for fifty years and had never spoken on the stage before, so he was both surprised and delighted. He straightened up, about to go up, when he heard applause like thunder, shouting, "Learn from the old technical workers!" Looking at the enthusiastic faces of the young people, he felt an unspeakable warmth in his heart. That night, when he returned home, he thought of the party history discussed in the political training class, the factory's management methods, the current production difficulties, and everyone's expectations of him. He felt that he should discard this "selfish desire." The next day, he decided to study technology with the workers.
　　He said, "In the past, conservatism was for a livelihood, now openness is for the people."
　　After the Party became public in the factory, he recalled his decades of work. He had never left the factory. Apart from a little "selfish desire," he had always been good at work and getting along with people. Now, he had broken down even that little "selfish desire." He decided to apply to join the Party. He requested to contribute all his strength under the education of the Party.
　　The Party approved his request. From then on, he became even more active.
　　When the workers in the maintenance department saw that Wang Fuyuan was willing to teach his skills, some were still worried and said, "Master Wang is teaching us, I'm afraid it's superficial. He will definitely keep the technique of wrapping carding fillets." But he said, "No! Whoever wants to learn, I will teach them. I'm taking out the whole pot!" He also suggested establishing a technical research class. From disassembling packed machine parts to assembling machines, he taught others honestly and reliably. In the past, he was the only one in the maintenance department who knew how to wrap fillets. Now, nine people have learned how to wrap fillets.
　　Soon, the carding fillets were damaged. They brought in twelve fillets and were about to wrap them when the machine in the factory that made the seat boards broke down again. They had to borrow from another factory, but they were only allowed to use it for four days. Time was short, and the fillets had to be wrapped. So, he took the lead in working overtime to complete the task. Under his encouragement, all the workers in the maintenance department participated. During work, others saw that he was old and advised him to rest more, but he refused. While working, he carefully corrected others' mistakes when wrapping the fillets, not letting go of even the smallest mistake, and seized the opportunity to teach others the technique. After wrapping the twelve fillets, they rushed to install thirty more.
　　Because of this, the factory, the general branch, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League jointly presented them with a silk banner, calling on everyone to learn from Wang Fuyuan's spirit of teaching apprentices and taking the lead in working hard. But Wang Fuyuan explained with a smile, "If it weren't for the Party's education, I would still be a conservative. This glory should belong to the Party."

### 王福元教徒弟  公开技术为人民、光荣属于共产党
天津中纺一厂中共总支部

　　王福元教徒弟
    公开技术为人民、光荣属于共产党
    天津中纺一厂中共总支部
    王福元是天津中纺一厂梳棉部的保全工头，今年五十岁，已有三十九年的工龄。这些年来，他大小干过十来家厂子，学得一手好技术，尤其是包梳棉机的针布，全厂第一。他平日待本部的工友很和蔼，就是不肯把技术教给人。别人求他，他总说：“我老王有银子宝你可以拿去；这手技术我死了也要逞进棺材，不教人的。”因此年青的工友都骂他“保守”。其实，他有他的道理。他没门子，没阔亲戚，他能够在旧工厂里混这些年，就凭这手技术。有门子没技术的人虽能爬在他头上，但却不能挤掉他，因为厂子里需要他的技术。他看透了这一点，就想：“人总是有私心的，我这点私心也不过是为了饭碗。”
    解放以后，起初，他仍旧抱着“人总是有私心的”观点，埋头干活，百事不管。但他渐渐的觉着时世不同了。从前大职员瞅他总是斜着眼看，只有在央求他那点“技术”时脸色才好看点。他呢？也总有些低下的可怜相。尤其是出厂入厂，自己两手一抬，让人像搜小偷一样地浑身上下搜一遍。现在呢？职员、工友相互间都很亲切和气。出厂入厂也再不那样搜身了。照他的话说，这是个奇怪的体念。
    八月里，海河涨水，工厂有些地方浸入了水。照过去习惯，上边下一道命令让下边解决就完了。现在却不同了，他却瞧见厂里的军事代表赤着脚，提着鞋，满厂查看，他更加奇怪了。他想“这批人为什么没私心呢？”后来，他参加了本厂的政治学习班，才弄清了这个道理。
    工厂的青年团成立总支，保全部的团员邀请他去参加总支成立大会。在会上，小青年对他十分尊敬，请他上台讲话。他活了五十岁，从来没有上台说过话，真是又惊又喜。他硬着头正要上去，又听得掌声响成一片，喊着：“向老技术工人学习！”他瞅着小青年们热情的脸，心头感到说不出的温暖。夜里回家，他想起了政训班里讲的党史，想起厂里的管理办法和目前生产上的困难，想起大家对他的要求，他觉得自己这份“私心”该丢掉了。第二天，他决定跟工友们研究技术。
    他说：“过去保守是为饭碗，现在公开是为人民。”
    厂里的党公开以后，他回想了自己几十年的工作。一直没离开过工厂，除了一点“私心”外，无论工作，和人相处都还好，现在把一点“私心”也打破了。他决心申请入党。他要求在党的教育下，贡献出自己全部力量。
    党批准了他的要求。从此他更积极了。
    保全部的工友们看见王福元肯教技术了，有人还耽心着说：“王师傅教咱，怕是浮皮事，包梳棉针布那手准会留着。”他却说：“不啦！谁愿学，我教谁，我是连锅都端出来啦！”他还建议成立了个技术研究班。从拆开装箱的机件到装成机器，他都一老一实的教给别人。过去，保全部就他一个人会包针布，现在已经有九个人学会包针布了。
    不久，梳棉针布坏了，他们领来了十二台针布，正要包装，厂里做座板的机器又坏了。他们不得不到别的厂借用，可是人家限定用四天。时间很短，针布又必须装起来。于是，他带头加班完成。保全部的工友在他的鼓舞下，全体参加了。在工作中，别人见他年龄大，劝他多休息，他不肯。他一面工作一面还细心地纠正别人装针布时的错误，那怕是一点小错误，也不放松，并抓住这个机会把技术教给别人。十二台针布包完以后，又赶装了三十台。
    因为这样，厂方、总支、工会、青年团联合赠送他们一面锦旗，并号召大家学习王福元教徒弟和带头干的精神。但王福元却笑咪咪地解释道：“要不是党的教育，我还是个保守派呢？这些光荣应该属于党。”
