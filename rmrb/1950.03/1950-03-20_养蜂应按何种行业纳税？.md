To the Editor:
    We have some questions regarding the "Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax" promulgated by the Government Administration Council on February 1st: Under what industry should beekeeping be classified? Is it the same as raising pigs and chickens? Can it be classified as a household sideline? Please provide correct instructions so that we can inform our beekeeping colleagues in various regions.

    Answer: 1. If one has a main occupation (such as operating a farm or other profession) and beekeeping is incidental, then beekeeping is a sideline.
    2. If one specializes in beekeeping (collecting honey or breeding), that is, beekeeping is the main source of livelihood, even if one is engaged in other industries, beekeeping should still be regarded as their profession.
    3. The income of general so-called household sidelines is limited to no more than one-half of the main business. If it exceeds this, it will not be considered a household sideline.

　　养蜂应按何种行业纳税？编辑先生：
    我们对于二月一日政务院颁布的工商业税暂行条例有不了解的地方：养蜂应属何种行业？是否与养猪养鸡等相同？可列为家庭副业？请给予正确指示，以便转告各地养蜂同业。
        北京市香饵胡同甲三十六号黄文诚
    答：一、有主业（如经营农园或其他职业）而附带养蜂，则养蜂为副业。
    二、专门经营蜂业（采蜜或繁殖），即以养蜂为生活之主要来源者，虽兼营他业，仍应视养蜂为其专业。
    三、一般的所谓家庭副业，其收入以不超过主业二分之一者为限，超过时，即不以家庭副业论。
