　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. The Northeast People's Government has begun distributing 1.2 trillion yuan (Northeast currency) in spring agricultural production loans. This loan will be issued in accordance with the principle of "developing production, fixed use, centralized use, and focused distribution," and will be issued in a way that it is repaid and not distributed as relief funds. The "Instructions on Issuing Agricultural Loans" issued by the Northeast People's Government in late February and the "Agricultural Production Loan Regulations" promulgated by the Northeast Bank stipulate that the main target of the loan is organized farmers who are actively engaged in production, followed by individual poor farmers who are indeed actively working and have difficulties, with the amount of the loan being at the discretion of the lender. The former will be charged interest at a monthly rate of 1.2%; the latter will be charged interest at a rate of 1.5%. This agricultural loan adheres to the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, and being fair and reasonable, and is issued by lending actual (goods) converted into cash (funds) to solve the difficulties of farmers lacking various major means of production, and consciously combined with improving agricultural production technology. Of the total loan amount, 16% is for new and improved agricultural implements, 14.8% is for various seeds, 9.4% is for fertilizer, 15.7% is for livestock, 34.3% is used to support the development of special crops such as cotton, hemp, tussah silk, fruit trees, and fishery production, and the remainder is used to solve the food, fodder, and small-scale water conservancy project costs in disaster areas. In order to unify the control of agricultural loan policies, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Rehe and other provinces have successively established agricultural loan distribution committees composed of provincial chairmen, directors of agriculture and forestry departments, directors of commerce departments, bank managers, and directors of provincial cooperatives, in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast People's Government. Many counties have also established agricultural loan committees at the county, district, and village levels to specifically control the distribution work. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Songjiang, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaodong: the main items prepared or being prepared for lending are 41,541 improved agricultural implements, more than 14.173 million catties of beans, wheat, rice and other seeds, 12,934 horses, 1,700 breeding horses and cattle, and 7,300 tons of fertilizer. In addition, Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces are also preparing to lend more than 8.4 million catties of soybean cake and more than 6.5 million catties of sorghum to farmers to solve the food and fodder difficulties in some disaster areas. Heilongjiang Province has already lent more than 5,600 horses to farmers. The seeds in Songjiang Province, the paddy field fertilizer in Jilin Province, and some of the fertilizer powder in Liaodong Province have also been transported to various counties and started to be distributed. Other kinds of goods will also be distributed at the end of this month and the beginning of April according to the needs of agricultural work. The preparation of goods for special products and fishery loans has been largely completed in Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces. Liaodong Province has purchased various disinfectants for this year's fruit tree loans; the cotton medicines have been transported to various places; and the cotton seeds will be allocated soon. The distribution of the province's 35 billion yuan fishery loan will be completed. After the spring tussah loan in the province was issued to silkworm farmers, according to statistics from Gaiping, Haicheng, and Zhuanghe counties alone, the difficulties of more than 29 million silkworm seeds were solved.
