The Soviet people highly respect you, one of the outstanding organizers and founders of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, for your service to the motherland. You have dedicated your entire conscious life to the cause of the working class, to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, and to the struggle for the construction of a socialist society in the Soviet Union.

In all positions of Party and state activities, as a loyal student of our great teachers Lenin and Stalin, you have brilliantly completed the tasks of consolidating the ranks of our glorious Bolshevik Party, guiding socialist economic construction, and implementing the Leninist and Stalinist foreign policy of the Soviet state, and resolutely fighting against the enemies of the socialist state at home and abroad.

In the years of trial of the Great Patriotic War, you victoriously served the great purpose of defeating the enemy. Now, with your inherent Bolshevik energy, you are dedicating all your strength and knowledge to the cause of building communism in the Soviet Union, and to our just cause of striving for peace and security for all peoples of the world.

Our friend and comrade, our dear Vyacheslav Mikhailovich, we wish you longevity, health, and fruitful labor for the further prosperity of our great motherland and for the complete victory of communism."
