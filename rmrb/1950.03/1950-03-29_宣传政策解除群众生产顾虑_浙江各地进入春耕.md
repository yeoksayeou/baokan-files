　　Promoting Policies to Alleviate Public Concerns About Production
　　Spring Ploughing Begins in Various Parts of Zhejiang
　　[By Our Correspondent] Comprehensive report: In areas of Zhejiang province where rent reduction and the autumn grain tax have been completed, the masses' concerns about production have been dispelled, and most areas have transitioned to spring ploughing. The biggest obstacle encountered in arranging this year's agricultural production is the concerns about production that exist among all classes. Rich and middle peasants generally worry about land redistribution, not being able to harvest what they plant, and heavy burdens due to having too much land. A large number of land transfers (giving land to others to cultivate) and layoffs have occurred in various places. In Xishao Village alone, rich peasants transferred 288 mu of land to poor and hired peasants and a few middle peasants. If this land is not properly handled, it is very likely to be abandoned, because poor and hired peasants generally lack food this spring, and have little or no draft animals, farm tools, and fertilizer. Secondly, there is the problem of layoffs. In the Ningbo area alone, nearly 70,000 hired laborers have lost their jobs, affecting the lives of 200,000 people, including their families, and hindering the spring ploughing and sowing of a large amount of land. According to a survey in Gaozhao Village, Jiaxing, land cultivated by hired laborers accounts for about 52% of the village's total land. On the poor and hired peasant side, there is a widespread mentality of waiting for relief and waiting for land redistribution. For example, a poor peasant cadre in Shang'an Village, Tangxi County, said: "What's the point of reclaiming wasteland? If I reclaim one more mu now, I'll get one less mu when the land is redistributed in the future." Wasteful phenomena also occur in some villages. Huang A Da's family of four in Buyun Village, Jiaxing County, harvested 14.5 shi of rice last year, which has now been completely consumed. Due to these situations, the development of spring ploughing production has been seriously affected.
　　In late February, the county and district people's governments of Jiaxing, Fenghua, Yuyao, Cixi, Zhenhai and other counties universally convened people's representative conferences, employer-employee consultation meetings, peasant representative meetings, and village cadre meetings. Through these meetings, various policies such as land reform, production, and burdens were explained, and the policy of "stabilizing the middle and leveling the two ends," "guaranteeing that whoever cultivates this year's self-cultivated land will reap the harvest," and "labor is the only way out even after land reform" were emphasized to address the ideological concerns of middle and rich peasants. On the other hand, propaganda and education were carried out to address the mistaken idea of poor and hired peasants relying on government relief, and poor and hired peasants who had performed well in production were commended to inspire everyone to actively produce.
　　Because these ideological concerns of the masses have been initially dispelled in various parts of the province, the production situation has significantly improved. Two-thirds of the laid-off hired laborers in the Ningbo area have now been retained. Gaozhao Village, Jiaxing, has signed new contracts after two employer-employee consultation meetings, retaining all employees. According to statistics from twelve villages in Yin County, 384 hired laborers have been retained. In Sandun District, Hangzhou County, cadres have gained an understanding of production, and after repeatedly educating the masses, the ideological concerns of the masses have been quickly eliminated. In various townships, land reclamation teams have been organized, and more than 230 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed. More than 12,250 mu of broad bean ditch mud (using ditch mud to suppress small grass, which can increase production by three dou per mu) have been dug, and more than 1,200 mu of mulberry and bamboo land have been plowed. Women in Yiqiao Township have never participated in agricultural labor, but because their ideological concerns have been broken, more than 20 women have gone to the fields to pick water chestnuts. After the peasant representatives in Shiliang District, Qu County, returned to their villages, their production enthusiasm was very high and they were able to motivate the masses to produce.

　　宣传政策解除群众生产顾虑
    浙江各地进入春耕
    【本报讯】综合报道：浙江各地在实行减租和秋征结束的地区，打破群众生产顾虑，大部转入春耕。各地在布置今年的农业生产中，遇到的一个最大阻碍，就是各阶层对生产工作存在顾虑。富农中农普遍有怕分田，怕种了不能收，怕地多出负担重的思想顾虑。各地发生了大量的推田（转让给别人种）与解雇的现象。仅西邵村富农转让给贫雇农及少数中农的土地达二百八十八亩。这部分田，如不作适当处理，大有荒废的可能，因贫雇农今春大都缺少食粮，而且没有或很少有耕畜、农具与肥料。其次是解雇的问题，仅宁波专区，失业雇工即近七万，包括雇工家属在内，影响着二十万人的生活，及大量土地的春耕播种。据嘉兴高照村的调查，雇工耕地的土地约占全村土地的百分之五十二。在贫雇农方面，则普遍存在着等救济、等分田的思想。如汤溪县上安村的贫农村干说：“开荒干什么，现在多开一亩，将来少分一亩”。部分村子并有浪费现象发生。嘉兴县步云村的黄阿大家，四口人，去年收了十四石半米，现在已经全部吃光。由于以上这些情形，严重影响着春耕生产的开展。
    二月下旬，嘉兴、奉化、余姚、慈溪、镇海等县县区人民政府，普遍召开了各界人民代表会议、雇工雇主协商会、农民代表会、村干部会。通过这些会议，解释说明了土改、生产、负担等各种政策，针对中农与富农的思想顾虑，着重进行了“中间不动两头平”，“保证今年的自耕部分谁种谁收”，“土改后也只有劳动才是出路”的政策宣传。另方面又针对贫、雇农依赖政府救济的错误想法，进行了宣传教育，并表扬了生产较好的贫雇农以启发大家积极生产。
    该省各地由于初步解除了群众这些思想顾虑，生产情况已有了较显著的好转。宁波专区被解雇的雇工，现在已有三分之二留用。嘉兴高照村经过两次雇工、雇主协商会议，已签订新的合同，全部留用了。鄞县十二个村统计，已留用了三百八十四个雇工。杭县三墩区，由于干部对生产有了认识，反复教育群众，群众的思想顾虑很快的消除了。在各乡镇，已组织了开荒队，已开荒地二百三十余亩。挖好蚕豆沟泥（用沟泥压死小草，每亩可多产三斗豆）一万二千二百五十余亩，刨好桑、竹地一千二百多亩。义桥乡的妇女从来不参加农业劳动，由于打破了思想顾虑，已有二十多个妇女下田摸荸荠。衢县石梁区农民代表回村后，生产情绪很高，并能带动群众生产。
