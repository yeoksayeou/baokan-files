　　Several Questions Regarding Tax Payment for Bicycles
To the Editor:
    On the 15th of this month, I bought a bicycle at the Limin Bicycle Shop on Qianmen Avenue in Beijing for 1.65 million yuan. That day, the bicycle shop sent the bicycle to the Third Sub-bureau of the Tax Bureau to pay the tax. The Tax Sub-bureau did not tax it according to the actual selling price, but added 50,000 yuan to the original selling price, that is, taxed it at 1.7 million yuan. I don't understand why this is.
    On the 16th, when I went to Qianmen Railway Station to handle the bicycle's consignment, according to the consignment procedures, after filling out the consignment note at the parcel room, I had to go to the Tax Bureau checkpoint in the southwest corner of the parcel room to check and stamp it before it could be consigned. After arriving at the checkpoint, the checkpoint staff asked me for the bicycle's vehicle donation fee. I said that the bicycle was not going to be ridden in Beijing and should not require a vehicle donation fee in Beijing. Another staff member asked me, "Has the bicycle been taxed?" I showed him the tax bill. Because the place of destination (Zhangjiakou) filled in on the tax bill did not match the place of destination (Xin'an Railway Station) where it was to be transported. He said, "The place of destination does not match, so consignment cannot be processed." I said, "The main significance of checking the tax bill is to prevent tax evasion, whether the place of destination matches is another matter." Another staff member at the checkpoint actually said, "Whether we charge you the vehicle donation fee or not is our prerogative, we can be flexible." At this point, I had to go to the bicycle shop for help. Later, the bicycle shop clerk and I returned to the Tax Bureau checkpoint at Qianmen Railway Station together. After repeated negotiations, and after the bicycle shop clerk repeatedly admitted their mistake and said many things to ask for their help, their hearts finally softened a bit. Finally, the bicycle shop clerk took the consignment note to the Qianmen Revenue Office for instructions. They wrote "Release" on the back of the consignment note and stamped it with the person in charge's seal, and the consignment procedures were finally completed. However, according to the person in charge of the Qianmen Revenue Office, it doesn't matter if the place of destination doesn't match when consigning one or two bicycles.
    Is it really necessary to pay the vehicle donation fee in Beijing if a bicycle bought in Beijing is not ridden in Beijing? Does the Qianmen Railway Station checkpoint of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau have the power to "flexibly" decide whether to collect the vehicle donation fee? If the place of destination filled in on the tax bill does not match the actual place of destination, or if the place of destination is not filled in on the tax bill at all, and the consignment is processed in this way, will there be a penalty when picking up the bicycle at the place of destination after checking the tax bill? Who should be responsible?
    Due to the high mobility of work, the bicycle needs to be constantly transported to other places. If we follow the Qianmen Railway Station checkpoint of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau's statement that the tax bill must follow the bicycle, but the original tax bill's place of departure, place of destination, and time limit are no longer applicable, what should be done? I hope the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau can provide detailed answers to all these questions.

### 关于自行车完税纳捐的几个问题

专栏：读者来信

    编者按：本报连续发表了一些读者来信，这对于各方面工作的改进，有着很大的帮助。欢迎大家把工作、生活中的问题尽量写给我们，并希各有关部门，对这些信件注意答复。
　　关于自行车完税纳捐的几个问题编辑同志：
    本月十五日我在北京前门大街利民车行买了一辆自行车，价格一百六十五万元。当日该车行送车到税务局第三分局去完税，税务分局并不按照实际售价给完税，而是按原售价多加了五万元，即一百七十万元完的税。这我不懂得是为什么？
    十六日我到前门车站办理自行车托运时，按照托运手续，在包裹房填好托运单后，是要到包裹房西南角税务局检查站查验盖章后才能托运走。到该检查站后，检查站的工作人员跟我要车子的车捐，我说这个车子是不在北京骑的，不应该在北京起车捐。另一个工作人员问我，“车子完税了吗？”我把税单给他看，因税单上所填的运达地点（张家口）与要运达地点（新安车站）不符。他说：“运达地点不符不能办理托运。”我说：“验看税单主要的意义是在防止偷税，运达地点相符否是另一个问题。”检查站的另一个工作人员竟说：“叫你上车捐或者不叫你上车捐，这个权力在我们，我们可以灵活运用。”事情发展到这里，我只好去找自行车行想办法，后来车行的店员和我又一同返回前门车站税务局检查站，再次交涉，经车行的店员再三的承认错误，说了许多请他们多多帮忙的话后，他们的心眼才活动了一下。最后由车行店员持托运单到前门稽征所请示了一下，他们在托运单的背面写上了“放行”二字，盖上了负责人的章，托运手续才算是办妥。不过，据前门稽征所的负责人谈，托运一、二辆自行车，运达地点不符是没什么关系的。
    究竟在北京买的自行车，不在北京骑，是否一定得在北京起车捐？京市税务局前门车站检查站有没有“灵活运用”征收车捐与否的权力？税单上所填写的运达地点与实际上要运达的地点不符，或者是税单上根本没有给填上运达地点，这样子办理了托运，到运达地点取车时，经检查税单后会受罚吗？责任应由谁负？
    由于工作的流动性大，车子需要不断转运他地，若照京市税务局前门车站检查站的说法，税单是要跟着车子走的。但是原税单上的起运地点、运达地点与运达期限都不适用了，这样子应该怎样办？所有这些问题，希望北京市税务局能作详细解答。
