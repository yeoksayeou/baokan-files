　　Important Experience

    Organize Voluntarily, Study Groups Need Teacher Guidance
    The main experiences of Harbin middle schools in carrying out extracurricular learning in the past six months are: First, extracurricular activities should be for digesting and consolidating regular class learning, and the methods can be diverse. Generally, study groups focus on combining with natural science courses, and other large-scale learning activities focus on combining with social science courses, but this is not a mechanical division. Second, formalism or inappropriate connection with reality must be opposed in the process. For example, some schools organize the whole school to carry out activities, and some students spend a lot of effort making mathematical models and compiling algebraic formulas into chess scores, which does not help much with learning. Third, various learning activities must be organized on the basis of students' conscious voluntariness. In the past, all students were often organized into many learning mutual aid groups, and it was rigidly stipulated that mutual aid learning should be carried out for a certain course within a certain period of time. As a result, students with good grades cannot further study and improve, and students with poor grades become dependent. Fourth, study groups must obtain the guidance and help of teachers of various subjects. Some groups invited teachers to participate from the beginning and received teachers' guidance and help at any time. The students' learning enthusiasm became higher and higher, and their interest became stronger and stronger. At the same time, the relationship between teachers and students became closer. However, another tendency must be prevented. For example, some groups are overly dependent on teachers. When learning, the teachers still explain and the students take notes, so that extracurricular learning becomes a disguised classroom learning. Fifth, various study groups are best led by the student union in a unified manner in order to promote them in an all-round way. The Communist Youth League then plays an ideological leading role through the League groups in the groups.

    在自愿基础上组织起来  钻研小组要有教师指导
    哈市各中学这半年来进行课外学习的主要经验是：第一、课外活动应是为了消化和巩固正课学习，方式可以多种多样。大致钻研小组着重结合自然科学课程进行，其他大型的学习活动着重结合社会科学课程进行，但也并非是机械分割的。第二、在进行中必须反对形式主义或不恰当的联系实际。如有些学校全校组织起来进行活动，有些学生费了很大力量做了数学模型，将代数公式编为棋谱，结果对学习帮助不大。第三、必须在同学的自觉自愿的基础上来组织他们进行各种学习活动。过去往往将全校学生编成许多学习互助小组，硬性规定在一定时间内对某一门课程进行互助学习。结果使成绩好的学生不能更进一步地钻研提高，成绩不好的学生产生依赖性。第四、钻研小组必须取得各科老师的指导和帮助。有些组一开始就请老师参加，随时获得老师的指导，帮助，同学的学习热情愈来愈高，兴趣也愈来愈浓。同时，使师生关系也更趋密切。但必须防止另一种倾向。例如有些小组过分依赖教师，学习时仍是教师讲解，学生记笔记，以致课外学习成了变相的课堂学习。第五、各种钻研小组最好由学生会统一领导，以求全面推动。青年团则通过小组中的团组发挥思想上的领导作用。
