Enhancing the Role of Party Organizations in Soviet Institutions
(Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Communist Party (B) H. Bagolyubov)

The Soviet state apparatus is the most mass-based apparatus serving millions of working people. Based on the Leninist-Stalinist theory of the state, the Party pays great attention to consolidating the Soviet apparatus, educating state officials and cadres with Bolshevik ideology, principles, and intolerance of shortcomings, waging a relentless struggle against bureaucracy and procrastination, and demanding unwavering adherence to socialist laws and precise execution of directives from higher authorities.

Party grassroots organizations play a significant role in successfully resolving the tasks facing Soviet institutions. As is well known, they differ from Party organizations in production departments and do not have the right to supervise administrative management. However, this does not mean that they are deprived of the possibility of influencing the work of their institutions.

The basic task of Party organizations in Soviet institutions is to improve the work of the institutions. Comrade Stalin, in defining the tasks of Soviet Party groups, demanded that they become the true supervisors of our Soviet institutions. Comrade Stalin taught Party organizations to resolutely combat bureaucracy and the indifference of state officials to the needs and requests of the working masses.

Every day, many workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals come to the institutions. It is important to improve the reception of visitors – that is, to avoid wasting people's time and unnecessary procedures, and to prevent people from hearing official and bureaucratic replies such as "Come back tomorrow!" Where Party organizations in Soviet institutions correctly understand their tasks, the institution always works properly and precisely.

Take the Party organization of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Kyrgyz Republic as an example. There were many chaotic phenomena in this ministry regarding the reception of visitors and the handling of complaints from the working masses. Therefore, the Party organization resolutely took on the task of eliminating these shortcomings. After analyzing the work of various departments in the ministry – the Fruit and Vegetable Bureau, the Grain Bureau, the Machine and Tractor Station Bureau, the Collective Farm Organization Department, and others – the Party Committee proposed streamlining the structure, strengthening leadership, and improving the work of each bureau. The Party Committee's proposals were discussed at Party meetings and accepted by the ministry's leaders. Thanks to the active intervention of the Party organization, a system was established for receiving visitors. By constantly and carefully studying the actual life of the institution, the Party organization reflected the shortcomings to the leadership and put forward practical suggestions for overcoming them. This work of the Party organization has had a very positive impact on the work of the Ministry of Agriculture.

The Charter of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stipulates that Party organizations in ministries have the obligation to report to higher Party authorities on the shortcomings in the work of the institutions and individual cadres.

The Party organization of the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic revealed serious shortcomings in the work of the supervisory authorities. It irresponsibly inspected the financial work of the institutions under its supervision, turning a blind eye to serious violations of financial discipline. Therefore, it failed to provide warnings and timely expose the squandering of individual cadres. The Party organization reported this matter to the Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Communist Party (Bolsheviks), after which the supervisory authorities of the ministry were greatly strengthened.

The Party organization has done a great job in abolishing unnecessary links in the ministries and their directly subordinate institutions. We often hear requests from the leaders of various republic institutions to increase staff. They say that the scope of work is expanding year by year, while the staff remains the same, so they find it difficult to cope with the work – some leaders often argue this way.

The Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the government of the republic established a committee to study the organizational structure and members of various institutions. Party organizations were attracted to participate in this work – through Party organizations, the active members of the institutions participated. By eliminating many overlaps in the work of institutions and groups and improving the organizational structure of the institutions, a more correct allocation of forces, and increased responsibility of each staff member for their work, it was possible to streamline more than a thousand staff members in the institutions of the republic. By eliminating redundant institutions and members, the work of the institutions was improved, and there was more order within the institutions. We quickly employed the streamlined personnel in other departments.

However, the Party organizations of the Soviet Party institutions are far from reaching the level required of them.

The Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Communist Party (Bolsheviks) inspected the work of the Party organization of the State Planning Bureau of the republic. It was found that they had facts of violating state and labor discipline and suppressing criticism and self-criticism, and that bureaucracy and procrastination existed in the institution. The Party organization did not react to them and did not properly report these facts to the higher Party authorities. This reduced its role, and the Party organization did not exert political influence on the State Planning Bureau. The Central Bureau listened to the work report of the Party organization at its meeting. Since being given assistance, the Party organization of the State Planning Bureau has significantly improved its work.

Such weak work also exists in the Party organizations of other Soviet institutions. Many organizations turn a blind eye to serious shortcomings in the institutions, do not fight to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the work of the institutions, live peacefully with facts that violate state discipline, and do not take necessary measures to improve mass political work among the staff. Staff meetings and production meetings are also infrequent and unsystematic, and the institution's staff is far from being educated in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. In many institutions, there are still some flatterers who love to offer courtesies.

The Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Communist Party (Bolsheviks) requires the state committees, city committees, and district committees to improve the leadership of these Party organizations. In the Central Bureau and various departments, the work reports of many Party organizations of the departments and other republic institutions were listened to. A meeting of the secretaries of the leading Party organizations concentrated in the center of the republic was also held. The state and city Party committees have also begun to pay special attention to the Party organizations of the institutions. For example, the Frunze City Committee discussed the plan to strengthen the Party organization and mass education work in the Party organizations of the institutions at the plenary session. Then this issue was raised to the meetings of district active members and grassroots Party organizations in the city for discussion.

The guidance to the secretaries of the Party organizations has also been improved, and the city and district committees have begun to regularly hold study classes. The following are some of the issues discussed in the study classes: the forms and methods of the Party organizations' struggle to improve the work of the Soviet institutions; the ideological and political education of state officials, etc. The instructors of the city and district committees now more often go to the Party organizations of the institutions to help the secretaries of the Party organizations formulate work plans, prepare Party meetings, and improve the political learning of the staff.

As a result of these measures, the level of Party work in the Soviet institutions has risen. Party meetings can be held more regularly, and practical work issues are raised in addition to general political issues, and criticism and self-criticism are widely carried out. Party members among the staff participate in the Party's education network for learning, and most of the staff in the institutions are studying Marxist-Leninist theory themselves.

Reports on the international situation and important decisions of the Party and the government are organized more often in the institutions than before. Lectures on various issues of Marxism-Leninism and natural science topics are also organized. Recently, in the Kyrgyz Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Planning Bureau, and the Highway Administration, many lectures and reports have been held, such as "On the Road of Gradual Transition from Socialism to Communism," "Science and Religion," "Stalin's Plan to Change Nature," "On Soviet Patriotism and National Self-Esteem of the Soviet People," and others.

The responsibility of the Party organizations of the Soviet institutions for the work of the state institutions is very heavy. The Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Communist Party (Bolsheviks) will continue to make efforts to improve its role in order to further consolidate and improve the state institutions and improve the work of the Soviet institutions.

　　提高苏维埃机关里党组织的作用
    （基尔吉兹共产党（布）中央委员会书记  Ｈ·巴高留波夫）
    苏维埃国家机关——是服务于千百万劳动人民的最群众性的机关。根据列宁斯大林关于国家的学说，党寄以极大的注意去巩固苏维埃机关，以布尔什维克的思想性、原则性与对缺点的不可容忍性教育国家的职员干部，对官僚主义与拖拖拉拉现象进行无情的斗争并要求着毫不踌躇的遵守社会主义的法律与精确的执行上级机关的指令。
    在顺利的解决摆在苏维埃各机关面前的任务时党的基层组织起了很大作用。正如众所周知，他们是和生产部门中的党组织有区别的，没有监督行政管理工作的权利。但这决不能说他们被剥夺了影响自己机关工作的可能。
    苏维埃机关里党组织的基本任务就在于能改善机关的工作。斯大林同志确定了苏维埃党小组的任务时，曾要求他们能成为我们机关里苏维埃的真正监督人。斯大林同志教导党的组织要同官僚主义与国家机关工作人员对劳动群众的需要与请求漠不关心的事实进行坚决的斗争。
    每天都有很多的工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子到机关里来，要搞好对访问者的接待——也就是说要避免人们白白的浪费时间与不必要的过程，不使人听到那种官样式的与官僚主义的答复：“明天来吧！”那里苏维埃机关党的组织正确的了解自己的任务，则那里的这个机关总是工作的得当与精确。
    用基尔吉兹共和国农业部的党组织为例。在这个部里对接待问事来访的人们与处理劳动群众的控诉等有很多紊乱现象。于是党组织坚决地负起铲除这些缺点的任务。分析了部里各局——果树蔬菜管理局、粮食局、机器拖拉机站管理局、集体农场组织处与其他等部门的工作后，党委会就提出了精减机构，巩固领导与改善各局工作的建议。党委会的建议在党的会议上讨论后被部的领导者接受了。由于党组织的积极干涉，对接待问事来访者也建立了制度。不断的缜密的研究了机关的实际生活后，党组织就将缺点反映到领导上并提出其克服的实际建议。党组织的这种工作对农业部的工作给与极有利的影响。
    联共（布）党党章规定各部的党组织负有向上级党的机关反映各机关工作与个别干部的工作缺点的义务。
    基尔吉兹苏维埃社会主义共和国财政部党组织揭露了监察机关工作的严重缺点，他不负责任的检察其所监督下的机关的财政工作，对他们那种严重的违反了财政纪律的事实熟视无睹。因此他也就未能给以警告并适时的揭露个别干部的浪费现象。党组织把这个事情报告了基尔吉兹共产党（布）中央委员会，此后该部监察机关才大大的巩固起来。
    党的组织在废除各部与其直属机关的不必要的环节的事业中做了巨大的工作。我们经常的由各共和国机关的领导者那里听到增加工作人员的请求。他们说，工作范围是一年一年的扩大而工作人员仍是照旧，所以感到难以应付工作。——一部分领导者经常的这样议论着。
    基尔吉兹共产党（布）中央委员会及共和国政府建立一委员会以研究各机关组织机构与成员。党的组织被吸引参加这一工作——通过党组织参加的则是机关的积极分子。由于消除了很多机关团体工作中的重叠现象与改善了机关的组织机构后，更正确的配备了力量，提高了每个工作人员对自己工作的责任心，而得以在共和国的机关里精简下一千多名职员。由于取消了多余的机构和成员，机关的工作改善了，各机关内更加有秩序。并将精简下来的人员我们又很快的采用到其他部门去。
    可是苏维埃党机关的党的组织还远未达到对他们所要求的那种水准。
    基尔吉兹共产党（布）中央检查了共和国国家计划局的党组织的工作。查明他们具有破坏国家与劳动纪律及压制批评与自我批评的事实，并在机关里存在着官僚主义与拖拉皮塌分子。党的组织对他们并没有反应也没有适当的将这些事实报告给上级党的机关。这样就降低了自己的作用，党的组织对国家计划局这一机关并没给以政治上的影响。在中央局的会议上曾听取了关于该党组织的工作报告。自从给以帮助后国家计划局的党组织才显著的改善了自己的工作。
    这样薄弱的工作在其他苏维埃机关的党组织中也存在的。很多的组织对机关里的严重缺点熟视无睹，不为提高机关工作的精确性与效力而斗争，而与破坏国家纪律的事实和平共居，也不采取必要的措施以改善职员中间的群众政治工作。职员的会议与生产会议也是不经常没有系统的，还远没有以布尔什维克的批评与自我批评精神教育机关职员。在很多的机关里还活跃着一些阿谀奉迎爱献殷勤的人。
    基尔吉兹共产党（布）中央委员会要求各州委会、市委会、区委会改善这些党组织的领导。在中央局与各部里都倾听了各部与其他共和国机关很多党组织的工作报告。并召开了集中在共和国中央的各首要机关党组织的书记的会议。州、市的党委会也开始特别注意于机关党的组织。例如伏龙芝市委会在全体会上就讨论了加强机关党组织中党的组织与群众教育工作的方案。而后这一问题又提到区内积极分子与市内基层党组织的会议上讨论。
    对党组织书记的指导也改善了，市委会与区委会开始正规的举办研究班。以下就是在研究班中所讨论的几个问题：党组织为改善苏维埃机关工作而斗争的形式与方法；国家机关职员的思想政治教育等。市委会和区委会的指导员现在更经常到机关党组织去帮助党组织书记拟定工作计划，准备党的会议，改善职员的政治学习。
    由于采取了这些措施的结果，使苏维埃机关中党的工作水准上升了。已经能更加正规的召开党的会议，在这些会议上除一般的政治问题外还提出实际的工作问题并广泛的展开了批评与自我批评。职员中的党员都参与到党的教育网中学习，机关里的大部工作人员自己都在研究着马克思列宁主义理论。
    在机关里比以前更经常的组织关于国际形势，党与政府的重要决定的报告。并组织马克思列宁主义各种问题与自然科学题目的讲演。如最近在苏联科学院基尔吉兹分院，在财政部、农业部、国家计划局与公路总局就举行了多次的讲演和报告：如“关于逐渐的由社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路”“科学与宗教”“斯大林改变自然的计划”“论苏维埃的爱国主义与苏维埃人民的民族自尊”以及其他等。
    苏维埃机关党组织对于国家机关的工作的责任是非常重大的。基尔吉兹共产党（布）中央委员会今后更将尽力提高其作用以达到国家机关进一步的巩固与益臻完备与改善苏维埃机关的工作。
