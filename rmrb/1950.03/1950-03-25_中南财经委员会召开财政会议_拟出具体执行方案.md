Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 23rd: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, in order to implement the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," held a financial conference from the 8th to the 19th of this month. More than 30 principal responsible persons from the financial, trade, and tax departments of the Central and Southern Region and its subordinate provinces and cities attended the meeting. The meeting fully discussed and made specific arrangements for various major issues in the implementation of the State Council's decision, and the specific plan has been submitted to the Central People's Government and the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee for review.

The meeting was personally presided over by Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee. After conveying the decision of the State Council, the responsible persons of finance and economy from various provinces and cities enthusiastically expressed their opinions, believing that the decision of the State Council was a major key to overcoming current financial and economic difficulties and completing and consolidating the victory. They unanimously expressed their unconditional support and guaranteed to resolutely implement it with practical actions. The participants were divided into three groups, focusing on discussing several major issues such as income and expenditure, establishment, warehouse inventory, and material allocation. Based on the specific conditions of different manpower and financial resources in various provinces and cities, everyone conscientiously studied and allocated specific figures for various income and expenditure items in 1950 for each province and city. The responsible persons of each unit fully demonstrated the spirit of careful calculation and overcoming difficulties, and actively sought ways to tighten expenditures and increase income in order to implement the decision of the State Council. The responsible persons of financial and economic work in various provinces and cities unanimously stated that they would complete the task according to the assigned proportion and strive for income to exceed it.

The meeting decided: In terms of income, those who have not completed the public grain task last year should seize the time to recover the outstanding payments. The first phase of public bonds should be sold out completely by the end of March, and all payments for those who have subscribed should be collected. Regarding tax work, capable cadres should be deployed, institutions should be reorganized, and efforts should be made to open up tax sources and reduce and eliminate tax evasion and tax leakage. In cities, the management of trade associations and exchanges should be strengthened, and armed anti-smuggling work should be strengthened along the coast. In terms of expenditure, the spirit of strict frugality should be strictly implemented. All expenditures must have business plans and financial plans, and expenditures can only be made after being reviewed and approved by the specialized management department and the financial department in accordance with the general plan and prescribed powers. Operating expenses should be used centrally and with emphasis. In order to ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production increase task, agricultural investment, agricultural loans, and water conservancy expenses should account for the main part of the expenditure. Agricultural investment should focus on increasing grain and cotton production, and the regional focus should mainly be in areas that were liberated earlier. Water conservancy expenses should mainly be used for the fundamental Han River management project, so that millions of people can be spared from the threat of floods. To take care of the country's financial difficulties, the living standards of staff should be appropriately reduced. The meeting also stipulated that all government departments are not allowed to entertain guests, give gifts, or send banners in the future. In principle, cadres from outside the region are not allowed to ask for leave to go home. All incidents in the past that have greatly damaged or lost national assets should be investigated and dealt with quickly, and the concept of protecting national property must be established in the minds of cadres.

Regarding the issue of staffing, the meeting decided that in addition to the establishment of the Central and Southern Region Staffing Committee, various provinces and cities must also quickly establish staffing committees separately in accordance with the decision of the State Council. The new staffing should be completed within April. Unofficial staff should be gathered at designated locations by the Staffing Committees of each province and city before the end of April, and reported level by level according to regulations, awaiting unified deployment and use. Regarding the issue of clearing warehouses, the meeting decided that in addition to the establishment of the Central and Southern Region Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee, various provinces, cities, counties, and enterprises and factories must also establish clearing committees separately, which should be established before the end of March. The clearing work should focus on the warehouses of various enterprises and factories, and all machines, equipment, materials, funds, and real estate should be cleared, registered, and reported. Regarding the completion of the grain transfer task, the meeting decided to establish the Central and Southern Grain Transportation Committee, and each province should organize a grain transportation headquarters. By the end of April, 70% to 80% of the transfer task should be completed in various places. The situation should be explained to the broad masses of the people through representatives of all sectors or farmers' congresses, and reasonable solutions should be provided for the grain needed by the masses. Another important provision of the meeting was that all those who have not established gold vaults should establish them by the end of March. Guangxi and some areas of Guangdong should also establish them by April 20th at the latest. Before the establishment, the county government should appoint someone to do the work of the gold vault to quickly launch the cash deposit work. In the discussion of various issues, everyone severely criticized the erroneous ideas that violated the principle of unity, such as departmentalism and localism, which existed in the minds of some units or individuals.

Finally, Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, made a summary at the meeting. In his summary, he explained that the implementation of the central government's decision on unifying financial and economic work is an arduous task that must go through serious struggles. Not only may conscious and unconscious resistance occur in the thoughts and actions of some cadres, but there are also many specific difficulties in the implementation that cannot be ignored and need to be overcome with effort. He particularly emphasized that to ensure the implementation of the task, first, it is necessary to require the responsible persons in various places to fully support it, mobilize all cadres, thoroughly understand the spirit of the central government's decision, and implement it firmly and unswervingly with practical actions, so as to overcome difficulties and complete the task. Financial and economic workers in various places should also frequently and proactively analyze the situation to the responsible persons, explain the advantages and disadvantages, weigh the pros and cons, and put forward solutions. Second, to complete the task, it is necessary to correctly grasp the policy direction and pay attention to preventing "left" and "right" deviations; if deviations have occurred, they must be corrected in a timely manner. Third, work must be prioritized, focusing on regional priorities and work priorities, and going all out. Finally, Vice Chairman Deng Zihui repeatedly emphasized that the four major tasks determined by this meeting—increasing income, reducing expenditure, unifying the system, and transferring materials—must be completed simultaneously, and cannot be delayed under the pretext of difficulties.
