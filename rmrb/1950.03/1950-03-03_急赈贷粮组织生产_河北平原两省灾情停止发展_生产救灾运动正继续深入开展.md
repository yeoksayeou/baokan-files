Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 2nd: The disaster situation in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces has been halted due to the central government allocating grain for relief and sending disaster area inspection teams to assist in disaster relief, especially under the leadership of local governments in actively organizing the masses for production and disaster relief. Currently, the production and disaster relief movement in both provinces is continuing to deepen.

　　After the Central People's Government successively allocated 13 million catties of emergency relief grain to Hebei Province to urgently rescue disaster victims in heavily affected areas, it stabilized the confidence of disaster victims in production for self-relief. Subsequently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, in conjunction with the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, organized a disaster area inspection team. The Hebei Provincial People's Government also dispatched ten inspection teams to heavily affected areas such as Tianjin, Tangshan, and Tongxian to inspect and assist in production and disaster relief work. The province's cooperatives also signed a contract with the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to borrow 120 million catties of coarse grain to develop sideline production. At the same time, various agencies, troops, factories, and schools in the province launched a movement to conserve and donate, with provincial and special district level agencies alone donating 400,000 catties of rice to relieve disaster victims. Through the above efforts, the province has begun to reverse the serious situation of the disaster continuing to develop, and the production and self-relief work in some areas has already made some new progress. For example, Xianghe County organized more than a thousand looms for production in half a month; the number of people participating in sideline production in Huanghua County has reached one-third of the county's population. In the process of distributing emergency relief grain, all localities have paid close attention to combining it with production. For example, after Jixian County received the loan grain, the output of fish farming even doubled compared to before. The province's experience has fully proved that as long as measures such as careful calculation, door-to-door relief grain assistance, and organizing disaster victims to carry out production are taken, disasters can be completely overcome. At present, the province has completed the task of transporting emergency relief grain to disaster areas and is carrying out the following tasks: (1) Convening county and district representative meetings to fairly and reasonably distribute relief grain, and organizing disaster victims to produce during the distribution process; (2) Strengthening cooperative work and signing sideline production contracts between the province and special districts, counties, districts, and villages; (3) Preventing spring epidemics, and 160-member epidemic prevention teams have been sent to disaster areas to work; (4) Solving the problem of animal power shortage and actively carrying out spring plowing preparation work.

　　The disaster relief work in Pingyuan Province took a detour before January. At that time, the province's leading organs only generally stipulated the policy of production for disaster relief, lacking specific organizational leadership and failing to help disaster victims solve production difficulties. Cadres in many areas also mistakenly held the view of underestimating the leadership of production for disaster relief. In addition, the 3.5 million catties of relief grain allocated by the Central People's Government, the 6.5 million catties of loan grain issued by the People's Bank of China, and the 40 million catties of grain used for work-for-relief were not quickly put into production, so the disaster situation was extremely serious. It was not until late January, when the Central People's Government sent a disaster situation inspection team to the province to directly assist in disaster relief work, and the province's leading organs reorganized the disaster relief committee, that the production and disaster relief work underwent a significant change. First, the province's disaster relief committee allocated 3.18 million catties of emergency relief grain, and first allocated 18 million catties of Yellow River levee restoration grain to implement work-for-relief, organizing disaster victims to repair the levee to meet urgent needs. In order to effectively strengthen the leadership of disaster relief work, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government and the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the CCP also transferred 142 cadres to form a disaster relief work team and went deep into the disaster areas to help with disaster relief work. At present, most of the disaster victims in the heavily affected areas of the province have found ways to produce, and most of the drained land has been planted with spring wheat. As long as the province continues to earnestly carry out production for self-relief work, the serious spring famine can be overcome.

　　急赈贷粮组织生产
    河北平原两省灾情停止发展     
    生产救灾运动正继续深入开展
    【新华社北京二日电】河北、平原两省灾情，经中央人民政府拨粮救济并派出灾区视察组帮助救灾，特别是在当地人民政府领导群众积极生产救灾下，业已停止发展。现两省生产救灾运动正继续深入开展中。
    河北省经中央人民政府先后拨发急赈粮一千三百万斤，紧急抢救重灾区灾民后，即稳定了灾民生产自救的信心。接着中央人民政府内务部并与中共中央华北局联合组织灾区视察组，河北省人民政府亦派出十个检查组，分赴天津、唐山、通县等重灾区检查和帮助生产救灾工作。该省合作社又与中央人民政府贸易部订立合同，贷得一亿二千万斤粗粮，发展副业生产。同时，该省各机关、部队、工厂、学校并展开节约捐输运动，仅省、专署两级机关即捐出米四十万斤，救济灾胞。经过上述努力，该省已开始扭转灾情继续发展的严重局面，某些地区的生产自救工作且已有了一些新的开展。如香河县在半个月内即组织起千余架织布机投入生产；黄骅县参加副业生产人数已达全县人口的三分之一。各地在发放急赈粮的过程中，都密切注意结合生产。如蓟县得到贷粮后，即使治鱼产量较前增加一倍。该省的经验已完全证明：只要采取精打细算，挨门深入赈粮扶助等方法，组织灾民进行生产，灾荒是完全可以克服的。目前该省已完成向灾区运送急赈粮的任务，正进行下列几件工作：（一）召开县、区代表会，公平合理地分配赈粮，并在发放中组织灾民生产；（二）加强合作社工作，分别订立省与专、县、区、村间的副业生产合同；（三）预防春疫，现已派出一百六十人的防疫队赴灾区工作；（四）解决畜力困难，积极进行春耕准备工作。
    平原省的救灾工作，在一月份以前曾走了一段弯路。当时省的领导机关仅一般规定了生产救灾方针，缺乏具体的组织领导，未能帮助灾民解决生产上的困难，不少地区的干部又错误地存在着轻视生产救灾领导的观点，加以未将中央人民政府所拨发的三百五十万斤赈粮，人民银行所发放的六百五十万斤贷粮以及以工代赈的四千万斤粮食迅速投入生产，因此，灾情极为严重。直到一月下旬，中央人民政府派出灾情视察组赴该省直接帮助救灾工作，和省的领导机关重新调整了救灾委员会的组织后，才使生产救灾工作有了显著的转变。首先由省的救灾委员会发拨急赈粮三百一十八万斤，并先行拨出黄河复堤粮一千八百万斤实行以工代赈，组织灾民进行修堤，以救急需。为了切实加强救灾工作的领导，平原省人民政府、中共平原省委又抽调干部一百四十二人组成救灾工作团，深入灾区，帮助救灾工作。现该省重灾区的灾民已大部找到了生产门路，脱水的土地也大部种上了春麦。只要该省继续认真地进行生产自救工作，严重春荒是可以战胜的。
