Party Life

Zhao Guilan's Recent Situation
　　Body in the Hospital Bed, But Her Heart Is in the Factory
　　Comrade Zhao Guilan is infinitely loyal and devoted to the Party, even dedicating her own body to the overall interests of the communist cause. The Party also cherishes and cares for its excellent daughter. At 11:00 AM on March 5th, comrades from the Dalian-Lüshun District Committee of the CPC personally visited Zhao Guilan, bringing with them a letter of sympathy from the District Committee and 20,000 yuan to help her recover. They stood at her bedside like loving parents, repeatedly tucking her in and reading her the letter. When she heard, "Comrade Guilan, take good care of yourself and recover! After you recover, come to the Party School to study, where we will help you improve your political and cultural understanding and cultivate you into a talented person who can better utilize your wisdom!" how excited and happy she was! When the comrades asked Zhao Guilan for her opinions, asking if she had any requests for the Party or felt any distress, she said that her greatest distress was not being able to participate in organizational life. The comrades told her, "Don't worry about organizational life for now. You have never left the Party for a single day. People come to see you and talk to you every day. You live in the embrace of the Party every day!" "After you recover, you can study at the Party School, where all the students are welcoming you!" Zhao Guilan deeply felt the happiness of living in a revolutionary family. She had not shed tears for her injuries, but she was so moved by the Party's motherly care that her nose felt a little sore. She tried her best to suppress her emotions, nodding excitedly and thanking the Party for its earnest concern.
　　On the morning of March 6th, when a reporter went to interview her, she asked the reporter to write a letter of reply to the Party Committee on her behalf. As she spoke, the reporter wrote: "Comrades of the Dalian-Lüshun District Committee: I worked in the factory for a long time, but I did not play a very significant role. This time, I was accidentally injured, and the Party cares for me and takes care of me so much. The hospital is treating me very well. The day before yesterday, the Dalian-Lüshun District Committee wrote me a letter, asking me to study at the Party School and gave me 20,000 yuan. The Party treats me like its own daughter. My injury has not yet healed, but the higher Party organization has already made plans for me. I am especially happy. The responsible comrades of the Party Committee came to see me, and I don't know what to say. The Party cares for me and cultivates me in this way. When I recover, I will study hard and dedicate all my abilities to the people. Please, comrades of the higher Party organization, don't worry about me. I am recovering quickly." When she read to here, she said: "I don't know what to say, what to say?" She laughed, laughing so comfortably and cheerfully, her emotions were completely integrated with the Party without any separation.
　　"March 8th," the women's festival, Zhao Guilan spent it more happily and gloriously than others. On this day, the Dalian-Lüshun Administrative Office issued a circular commending Zhao Guilan, calling on all employees to earnestly learn from her excellent quality of selflessness and devotion to the public. A special letter of sympathy was sent, and Vice Chairman Qiao of the Administrative Office, along with responsible comrades from various departments, brought gifts of sympathy to visit her. The Dalian-Lüshun Women's Federation, the Party School of the Dalian-Lüshun District Committee of the CPC, and the Women's Federation Branch of the District Committee also wrote letters to Comrade Zhao Guilan with heartfelt sympathy. Zhao Guilan herself was neither arrogant nor complacent because of these lofty honors. Her body was lying in the hospital bed, but her heart was still in the factory. When she closed her eyes, she dreamed of herself wearing a white work uniform and working happily in the studio. When she learned that she could study at the Party School after her illness, and the doctor told her that her right hand could recover and she could be discharged from the hospital in another month, how excited and happy she was, like a child longing to meet a long-separated mother, counting the days and looking forward to the day of discharge coming soon.

### 赵桂兰近况  身在病床心在工厂

　　赵桂兰近况
    身在病床心在工厂
    赵桂兰同志对党无限忠诚热爱，甚至为共产主义事业的整体利益奉献出自己的身体；党对自己的优秀女儿也同样爱护关怀。三月五日上午十一时，中共旅大区党委的同志们，亲自去看望赵桂兰，并且带来了区党委给她的慰问信和送她补养身体的两万块钱。他们像亲父亲一样站在她床前一次再次地为她盖被子，给她读信。她听到“桂兰同志，你好好养病吧，等你伤好以后，到党校来学习，帮助你提高政治和文化，把你培养成为更能发挥你的智慧的人材！”她是怎样的兴奋、愉快啊！当同志们征求赵桂兰的意见，问她对党有什么要求，感到什么苦闷时，她说她最苦闷的是过不着组织生活，同志们告诉她：“先别着急过组织生活，你没有一天离开过党，天天有人来看你，讲话给你听，你每天生活在党的怀抱中！”“养好了病上党校学习，党校全体同学正欢迎你去呢”！赵桂兰深深地感觉到生活在革命大家庭中的幸福。她没有为伤痛流过泪，但被党的母亲般的爱抚感动得鼻子有些发酸。她尽力压制着自己，她激动地不断点头，答谢党对她的殷切关怀。
    三月六日早上，当记者去访问她时，她要求记者代她写一封回信给党委。她说着记者代她写着：“旅大区党委的同志们：我在早在工厂工作，也没有起什么很大的作用。这回不小心负了伤，党对我这样关心，这样照顾，医院给我治疗得也很好。前天旅大区党委给我写了一封信，叫我到党校去学习，还送给我两万元钱。党拿我就像亲生的女儿一样，我的伤还没养好，上级党早就给我打算好了。我特别愉快，党委的负责同志都来看我，我也不知道说什么好了。党对我这样关心，这样培养，我好了一定好好学习，有什么能力都贡献给人民。请上级党的同志们，不要挂心了，我已经快好了。”她念到这里时说：“我也不知道说什么好了，说什么呢”？她笑了，笑得那样舒畅爽快，她的情感已完全和党融合在一起而无丝毫隔离。
    “三八”，妇女们的节日，赵桂兰过得比别人更愉快光荣。这一天旅大行政公署通令嘉奖赵桂兰，号召全体职工认真学习她舍己为公的优秀品质。并致专函慰问，同时由行署乔副主席携同各厅处负责同志携带慰问品前往探问。旅大妇联，中共旅大区党委党校及区党委妇联分会等也都写信给赵桂兰同志以亲切的慰问。赵桂兰同志自己则既没有为这些崇高的荣誉而矜骄。她身子躺在病床上，心还是在工厂里。一闭眼，就梦见自己穿着白工作服在工作室里愉快地工作。当她知道了病后可以进党校学习，而医生又告诉她她的右手可以复原，再过一个月就可以出院时，她是怎样地兴奋愉快，像小孩子渴望着会见久别的妈妈一样，数着日子盼望着出院的日子赶快到来。
