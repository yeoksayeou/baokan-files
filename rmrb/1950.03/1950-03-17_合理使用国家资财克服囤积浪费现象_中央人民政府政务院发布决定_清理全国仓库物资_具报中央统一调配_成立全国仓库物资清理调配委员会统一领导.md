Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The State Council of the Central People's Government has issued a decision on the cleanup and allocation of warehouse materials nationwide (approved at the 23rd administrative meeting of the State Council on March 10, 1950). The full text is as follows:

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, many state-owned materials and equipment were piled up in warehouses across the country. After liberation and takeover by the People's Government, these have not yet been cleaned up, resulting in failure to utilize them or to utilize them rationally. If these materials and equipment can be quickly cleaned up and used rationally nationwide, some can be used for the country's basic industries, some can offset industrial investment, and others can be converted into cash. In order to achieve the above objectives and overcome the phenomenon of hoarding materials and equipment and wasting funds existing in various enterprises and military-political units, the following provisions are hereby made:

1.  All warehouses taken over in various regions and departments nationwide, as well as warehouses self-provided by various enterprises and departments, shall be thoroughly investigated and cleaned up, to be completed by June 30, 1950. After the investigation and cleanup are completed, a list of materials shall be prepared and reported level by level to the central specialized agency.

2.  The materials and equipment investigated and cleaned up in accordance with Article 1 shall be uniformly allocated by the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee after consultation with the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council or the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government. The allocation principles are as follows:

    (A) All industrial, mining, transportation departments, and their affiliated enterprises, in addition to the fixed amount of fixed capital and circulating capital or materials and equipment that should be retained in accordance with regulations, shall hand over the remaining materials and equipment that should not be retained to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for allocation.

    (B) All materials stored in all warehouses of the trade departments and their affiliated trade companies, whether they are received materials or operating materials, shall be inventoried and valued. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council shall determine the total investment amount of the national trade companies. After the inventory and valuation, all materials exceeding the total investment amount shall be handed over to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for allocation after pricing.

    (C) All materials and equipment in all financial departments and their affiliated warehouses, regardless of whether they were seized, received, or purchased, except for those purchased with this year's allocated funds, shall be priced and handed over to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for allocation.

    (D) All warehouses in the military system, regardless of whether they are taken over or accumulated over the years, shall be thoroughly investigated. After the investigation and cleanup are completed, a list shall be prepared and reported to the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee. All materials and equipment shall still be uniformly allocated by the Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government.

3.  All income from cleaning up warehouses shall be turned over to the state treasury, and the handling methods shall be in accordance with the following provisions:

    (A) Industrial, transportation, agricultural, and other departments that requisition machinery, materials, and other materials within the scope of the 1950 business plan approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council shall be priced and allocated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council and transferred by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government to offset investment. If the above departments must use certain inventory materials or equipment due to business needs but are not within the scope of investment, they may apply to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for allocation; those approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council shall either be treated as increased investment or have the price collected by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government.

    (B) Daily necessities cleaned up that fall within the scope of the trade company's business operations may be allocated to the trade company for sale with the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Trade shall be responsible for pricing and signing contracts to offset trade investment or regularly recover currency.

    (C) Materials recovered from cleaning up warehouses that do not belong to machinery, industrial and transportation equipment, and are not suitable for sale by trade companies, as well as miscellaneous materials and old materials (such as old clothing, etc.), shall be handed over to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for auction to recover currency.

    (D) Warehouses in the military system shall, in principle, be uniformly managed by the Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government. When the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee deems it necessary, it may also dispatch materials and equipment stored in warehouses in the military system with the approval of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government.

    (E) In addition to the above materials and equipment, all materials and equipment that cannot be disposed of or utilized this year shall be classified by type, and appropriate warehouses shall be established for unified management by the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee, or designated to a certain department or region for custody, and a strict warehouse management system shall be established.

4.  All material and equipment distribution plans and economic exchanges between public enterprises during the Kuomintang period are declared invalid. All enterprises and regions shall not use them as a basis for requesting the allocation of materials and equipment. All public enterprises nationwide shall re-register their assets and verify their capital.

5.  In order to carry out the above work, it is decided to establish the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee, with two departments for military system warehouses and non-military system warehouses, to carry out work under the unified leadership of the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee.

    (A) The military system warehouse shall be responsible for organizing the military system warehouse material cleanup and allocation department by the Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government.

    (B) The non-military system warehouse shall be organized by the Material Distribution Department of the Central Financial and Economic Planning Bureau as the basis for the general warehouse material cleanup and allocation department.

    (C) The people's governments (or military-political committees) of major administrative regions and the necessary enterprise departments of the central government shall establish warehouse material cleanup and allocation sub-committees to carry out the investigation and cleanup work of the respective regions and enterprise departments under the unified leadership of the general committee, and may establish necessary working bodies.

    (D) When the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee deems it necessary, it may organize working groups to go to various regions and departments to conduct warehouse inspections.

6.  The Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee is an independent accounting unit. The necessary sorting, collection, and repair of warehouse materials must be carried out, and the expenses shall be budgeted separately and handled in accordance with financial administrative procedures.

7.  The cleanup of warehouses must be carried out conscientiously and responsibly. From the date of announcement of this decision, all materials and equipment stored in warehouses shall not be privately transferred, concealed, sold, damaged, privately given, or refused to be dispatched. Violators will be punished by law.

　　合理使用国家资财克服囤积浪费现象
    中央人民政府政务院发布决定
    清理全国仓库物资  具报中央统一调配
    成立全国仓库物资清理调配委员会统一领导
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院发布关于全国仓库物资清理调配的决定（一九五○年三月十日政务院第二十三次政务会议通过），全文如下：
    国民党反动统治时期，各地仓库中堆积着许多属于国家的物资和器材，各地解放，人民政府接收之后，尚未加以清理，因而未能利用，或未合理地加以利用。这些物资和器材如能迅速加以清理，并在全国范围内合理使用，则一部分可以用于国家的基本工业，一部分可以抵付工业投资，另一部分则可以变为现金。为了达到上述目的，并克服各企业各军政单位存在着的囤积物资器材浪费资金的现象，特作如下规定：
    一、全国各地区各部门所有接管的仓库及各企业各部门自备的仓库，一律加以彻底清查，限于一九五○年六月三十日完成，清查完毕后，须造报物资清册，逐级上报中央专管机关。
    二、按第一条清查出之物资器材，统一归全国仓库物资清理调配委员会商请政务院财政经济委员会或中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会调配之，其调配原则如下：
    （甲）各工矿交通部门及其所属企业，除依照规定应保有之一定数量的固定资金及周转资金或物资器材外，其余不应保有之物资器材，均交政务院财政经济委员会调配。
    （乙）贸易部门及其所属贸易公司之一切仓库所存物资，不论是接收物资抑经营物资，一律清查估价。由政务院财政经济委员会确定全国贸易公司之总投资额，在清查估价后，其超过总投资额部分之一切物资，均于作价后交政务院财政经济委员会调配。
    （丙）所有财政部门及其所属仓库之物资器材，不论缴获接收价购，除以今年领用之经费购买者外，一律作价交政务院财政经济委员会调配。
    （丁）军事系统所有之仓库，其物资器材，不论是接管的或历年积存的，应一律加以清查，清查完毕后，造具清册，报全国仓库物资清理调配委员会，其所有物资器材仍由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会后勤部统一调配。
    三、所有清理仓库收入，一律归国库，其处理办法依下列规定：
    （甲）工业、交通、农业等部门，领用经政务院财政经济委员会批准之一九五○年事业计划范围以内之机器材料等物资者，由政务院财政经济委员会计价拨付，经中央人民政府财政部转账，抵付投资。上述各部门由于事业之需要必需使用某项库存物资或器材而不属于投资范围者，可向政务院财政经济委员会申请调拨；其由政务院财政经济委员会批准者，或作增加投资或由中央人民政府财政部核收价款。
    （乙）清理出之日用品，属于贸易公司业务经营之范围者，经政务院财政经济委员会之决定，可拨交贸易公司出卖，并责成中央人民政府财政部与贸易部作价，签订合同，抵付贸易投资，或定期回笼货币。
    （丙）清理仓库收回之物资，其不属于机器、工业交通器材和不适于贸易公司出卖之零星物资及破旧物资（如旧衣物等），交由中央人民政府财政部拍卖，收回货币。
    （丁）军事系统的仓库，原则上由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会后勤部统一掌管，全国仓库物资清理调配委员会认为必要时，亦得经中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会之批准，调度军事系统仓库所存物资器材。
    （戊）除上述各项物资器材外，凡今年不能处理或利用之物资器材，一律分别种类，建立适当仓库，由全国仓库物资清理调配委员会统一掌管，或指定某部门某地区代管，并建立严密的仓库管理制度。
    四、所有在国民党时期对各公营企业之一切物资器材分配计划及全国各公营企业之间的经济往来，宣布一律无效，各企业各地区均不得以之作为要求调配物资器材之根据。全国各公营企业一律重新登记资产，核定资金。
    五、为进行上述工作，决定成立全国仓库物资清理调配委员会，分设军事系统仓库与非军事系统仓库两部门，在全国仓库物资清理调配委员会统一领导之下进行工作。
    （甲）军事系统仓库由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会后勤部负责组织军事系统仓库物资清理调配部。
    （乙）非军事系统仓库由中央财经计划局物资分配处为基础，组织一般仓库物资清理调配部。
    （丙）各大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）及中央各必要的企业部门设立仓库物资清理调配分会，在总会统一领导下，进行各该地区各该企业部门之清查工作，并得建立必要的办事机构。
    （丁）全国仓库物资清理调配委员会认为必要时，得组织工作团分赴各地区各部门进行仓库检查。
    六、仓库物资清理调配委员会为一独立的会计单位，仓库物资必需进行必要的整理、搜集、修理，其费用单立预算，依财务行政手续办理领销。
    七、清查仓库必须认真负责，自本决定宣布之日起，所有仓库存放之物资器材，不得有私自转移、隐瞒、变卖、毁坏、私相授受、拒绝调度等行为，违者以法律制裁之。
