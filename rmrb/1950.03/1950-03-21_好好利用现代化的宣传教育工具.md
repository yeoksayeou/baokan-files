　　Make Good Use of Modern Propaganda and Education Tools
　　·Ling·
    Many of our organizations are not accustomed to or not good at using radio stations for education, propaganda, mobilization, and experience exchange. Some trade union leaders are busy running to various factories to speak all day long, but there are too many factories to handle. Some factories have organized broadcasting groups; they give a talk on the radio at a certain time, and everyone can hear it. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' notices, calls, and instructions, as well as workers' various problems and experiences in production, learning, and life, can all be broadcast by trade union cadres and workers during the scheduled time for workers' programs on the radio. Not only can local workers' groups listening to the radio hear it, but workers in other places can also learn from it. This is the most effective method in the shortest amount of time.

    Many organizations and factories pay attention to mobilizing their employees to watch good movies, but mostly just for entertainment. If everyone could be further organized to discuss them after watching, it would also play a significant role in ideological education and improvement of working methods.

    Radio stations and movies are the most effective propaganda and education tools; we have already mastered these modern tools in major cities, and we must make good use of them.

　　好好利用现代化的宣传教育工具
    ·翎·
    我们很多机关团体还不习惯或不善于利用广播电台来进行教育、宣传、鼓动及交流经验。有些工会领导干部整天忙着跑到各厂讲话，工厂太多，忙不过来。也有的厂子把广播小组组织起来；在一定时间到广播电台一讲，大家就都听到了。总工会的通知、号召、指示，工人们在生产、学习、生活上的各种问题和经验，都可以在电台规定播送工人节目的时间由工会干部和工人们广播出去，不但当地收听广播的工人小组都可以听到，其他各地工人听到也可以学习。这是以最短时间能收最大效力的方法。
    对于好的电影，不少机关工厂是注意了动员员工们去看的，但大半只是为了娱乐。如果能在看过之后进一步组织大家讨论，对思想上的教育和工作方法的改进也是会起很大作用的。
    广播电台和电影，是最有效的宣传教育工具；在各大城市我们已经掌握了这些现代化的工具，就要好好利用它们。
