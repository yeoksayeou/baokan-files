Loving Zhao Guilan
    We don't know Zhao Guilan, but her name will forever be in our hearts!
    Zhao Guilan, the good daughter of the Communist Party, has already gained the boundless respect and love of the masses in Lüda. Comrade Wu Yanan of the Lüda Democratic Women's Federation called on the women of Lüda to make studying Zhao Guilan one of the topics for discussion during the "March 8th" Women's Day. However, female workers, women's work organizers, elementary school students... were so moved by Zhao Guilan's heroic deeds that they couldn't suppress their enthusiasm and started holding discussion meetings and writing letters of condolence even before "March 8th"...

    As soon as an article about Zhao Guilan was published in "Women's Friend" (edited by the Lüda Democratic Women's Federation), the comrades who edited "Women's Friend" immediately became busy. Readers' inquiries came in one after another by telephone, and they went out separately to collect materials and gather reflections... They ran around for three consecutive days, and no one felt tired. When they came back in the evening, they eagerly shared information about the readers. The Democratic Women's Federation also sent books and materials such as "How Steel Was Tempered," "The Rainbow," "Female Communist Party Member Sister Shuai," "Danniang," and "Steel Warrior Wang Huanan" to Zhao Guilan, and wrote a letter to the head nurse of the hospital, requesting her to find someone to read a page of the book to Zhao Guilan every day.

    The female workers of the Guanghua Light Bulb Factory held a discussion meeting. One female worker, who was a good friend of Zhao Guilan, spoke while crying... The other workers who listened all started crying. After a moment of silence, everyone wiped away their tears and resolved to turn their love and respect for Zhao Guilan into a fighting force for active production. Countless workers shed tears for Zhao Guilan and swore to actively produce, vowing to do the same as Zhao Guilan. The teachers of Dalian No. 1 Elementary School also held a discussion meeting. When discussing whether Zhao Guilan should have thrown out the "fulminate of mercury," they argued so fiercely that they slammed the table. Some said, "If the 'fulminate of mercury' is thrown away, national property will be lost"; others said, "It should be thrown away, property is not as important as cadres." The two sides couldn't agree, and as a result, they each retained their own opinions. (Regarding this issue, we hope readers can start a discussion - Editor)

    Letters of condolence came from all directions. All the children of No. 1 Elementary School wrote enthusiastically: "Your noble character and outstanding deeds are the glory of the Party and also the glory of all of us. But more importantly - we have been educated by your glorious deeds. ... We are determined to learn from you. Learn from your overall view of forgetting self for the public, learn from your high sense of responsibility, learn from your indomitable work spirit and noble character."

    Many female comrades and women's work organizers were also moved to tears by Zhao Guilan. As Xue Guizhen, a women's work organizer in Tianjin Street, Dalian (formerly illiterate, now knows nine hundred characters), said in her article: "I want to tell every woman about Zhao Guilan's deeds. We don't know Zhao Guilan, but her name will forever be in our hearts."

　　热爱赵桂兰
    我们是不认识赵桂兰的，而她的名字我们将永远记在心里！
    共产党的好女儿赵桂兰在旅大已经获得了群众的无限崇敬和热爱。旅大民主妇联总会吴亚南同志曾号召旅大妇女，把学习赵桂兰做为“三八”节的座谈内容之一。但是，女工友们，妇女工作者、小学生……他们为赵桂兰的英雄事迹感动得无法抑压自己的热情，等不到“三八”节，就开起座谈会写起慰问信来……。
    关于赵桂兰的文章在“妇友”（旅大民主妇联总会编）上一登出，编“妇友”的同志们立刻忙起来了。读者询问的电话接连不断，她们又分头出去跑材料，搜集反映……。接连跑了三天，谁也不感疲劳。晚上回来还争先恐后地兴奋地交谈读者的情况。民主妇联总会还把“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“虹”、“女共产党员帅大姐”、“丹娘”、“钢铁战士王化南”等书籍资料送给了赵桂兰，并写信给医院的护士长，请求她找人每天为赵桂兰朗读一页书。
    光华灯泡工厂的女工友们开了一个座谈会，有一个女工是赵桂兰的好朋友，她一边哭一边述说……听的工友们都哭起来了，沉默了一会，大家擦干眼泪要把对赵桂兰的敬爱变为积极生产的战斗力量。不知道有多少工友们为赵桂兰流泪，也为赵桂兰发誓而发誓积极生产。大连第一完小的教师们也开了座谈会。在讨论赵桂兰应不应扔出“雷汞”时，争辩得拍起桌子。有的说：“扔了‘雷汞’国家财产要受损失”；有的说：“应该扔出去，财产没有干部要紧”。两方意见相持不下，结果各自保留自己的意见。（关于这个问题，我们希望读者能展开讨论——编者）
    慰问的信件来自各方。第一完小的全体小朋友热情地写道：“你这崇高的品质、卓绝的事迹，是党的光荣，也是我们大家的光荣。但更重要的是——由于你的光荣事迹教育了我们。……我们决心向你们学习。学习你为公忘私的整体观点，学习你那高度的事业心，学习你那不屈不挠的工作精神和高贵品质。”
    许多女同志和妇女工作者也被赵桂兰感动得流下泪来，正如大连市天津街坊的一位妇女工作者薛桂珍（原系文盲，现识九百字）的文章里说的：“我要把赵桂兰的事迹告诉给每个妇女。我们是不认识赵桂兰的，而她的名字我们是永远记在心里”。
