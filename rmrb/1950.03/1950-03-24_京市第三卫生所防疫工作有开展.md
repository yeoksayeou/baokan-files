[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Third Health Clinic, implementing the Ministry of Health's guiding principle of "prevention first, treatment secondary," utilized the free time during the winter vacation school health work period to carry out mass health publicity and education work. In February, the clinic mobilized all medical staff, divided into four groups, to go to various sections of the jurisdiction. With the help of local police stations, they held mass meetings to promote epidemic prevention injections, maternal and child health, vaccination, BCG vaccination, and infectious disease prevention. A total of eighteen meetings were held, with 5,898 people attending. At the same time, in coordination with this publicity campaign, vaccinations and diphtheria vaccinations were carried out, with great success. As of now, a total of 2,961 diphtheria vaccinations and 902 vaccinations have been completed. This work has been of great educational significance to the cadres of the clinic and the citizens of the Inner Third District. The clinic's connection with the masses has become closer than before, and the number of people coming to the clinic for vaccination, preventive injections, and prenatal check-ups has doubled.
