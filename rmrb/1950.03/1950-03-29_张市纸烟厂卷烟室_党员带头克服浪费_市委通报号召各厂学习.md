Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory Cigarette Rolling Room: Party Members Take the Lead in Overcoming Waste
Municipal Party Committee Issues Circular Calling on All Factories to Learn

The cigarette rolling room of the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory previously had serious waste problems. According to the factory branch secretary's report, from the factory's opening on "August 1st" last year to the end of the year, in five months, a total of 131.597 rolls of paper were lost (a loss rate of 4.26 percent). With each roll priced at 245,000 yuan, the total loss amounted to 19,396,160 yuan, equivalent to 37,300 jin of millet. A total of 73 large cases of substandard tobacco were produced (all of which were sold at half price), resulting in a loss of 31,025,000 yuan, equivalent to 62,050 jin of millet. The above two items totaled a loss of 99,350 jin of millet, exceeding one and a half times the five-month wage expenditure of the room's 30 workers (38,750 jin). The causes of the losses, according to investigations, were: 1. Rolling machine operators frequently left their posts, preventing the immediate stoppage of machine malfunctions. 2. Electric soldering irons were not cleaned frequently; uncut tobacco stalks in the tobacco silk easily tore the rolling paper. 3. When machines broke down, technicians were not called for repairs; instead, workers, unable to find the problems themselves, would repair the machines without authorization, increasing losses during testing. 4. Paste tanks were not cleaned regularly, preventing the rolling paper from sticking to the paste.

On January 10th of this year, the cigarette factory branch and the provincial and municipal trade union work teams jointly studied the above situation and decided to focus on the cigarette rolling room to launch a production and conservation movement. Cadres went down to the shop floor and first approached the Party members on machines No. 4 and 5 to individually mobilize them, urging them to complete the tasks assigned by the Party and break the record for reducing waste without affecting product quantity and quality. On the first day after the mobilization (January 12th), Yu Chaopin's machine No. 4 saw its loss rate immediately drop to 1.08 percent, with its output ranking second among all seven machines in the room. Ji Shuming's machine No. 5 saw its loss rate drop from 3.3 percent in early January to 2.1 percent, while its output ranked first in the room.

The leadership immediately communicated this new record to the Party members and operators on each machine to encourage everyone. As a result, Party members and the masses, especially the machine operators, secretly stepped up their efforts. Workshop foreman Yuan Baozhen was actively responsible, not only repairing machines every day when she came to work but also providing timely guidance and inspection to each workshop. As a result, in just three days from January 12th to 14th, significant achievements were made: the average consumption rate of rolling paper dropped from 3.81 percent in December last year to 1.93 percent. The loss rate of machine No. 4 on the 14th had dropped to 0.52 percent, setting a new record. Compared with December, this could save 6,123 jin of millet per month. The waste rate of cigarette sticks also dropped from 0.7 percent in the past to 0.12 percent. At the same time, the three-day output exceeded the original plan (90 cases per day) by 43 large cases. The monthly waste of cigarette sticks can be reduced by 11 large cases of substandard tobacco (at half price), equivalent to 9,151 jin of millet. The two items together totaled 15,274 jin of millet, exceeding the room's monthly wage expenditure by more than one time.

The experience gained during these three days of intensive work was: 1. The leadership's ideology and work pace of the Party, government, and trade union must be consistent; 2. The leadership concentrating its efforts, making a breakthrough at one point, gaining experience, and promoting the overall situation has proven to be a successful leadership method. For example, the cigarette rolling room initially only focused on two operators (Party members) to get their thinking right and help them achieve results. After that, they were immediately commended and promoted, which resulted in the entire room becoming involved in the production and conservation upsurge; 3. In the production and conservation movement, Party members played an exemplary role, leading the masses to break the erroneous perception of some comrades who believed that "the Party cannot play a role in the factory," and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, and enhanced the Party's prestige among the masses; 4. The leadership should promptly grasp the precise statistics of output and waste. Only by using these concrete facts to educate the workers can they easily accept it, otherwise, merely shouting slogans will not achieve much.

Now, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee has issued a circular to commend the factory's cigarette rolling room's Party members for leading the masses in conserving state property and overcoming serious waste, and calls on Party members of all factory branches to learn from them. In addition, it instructed the factory branch secretary, Jiao Dahai, to pay tribute to all the workers in the cigarette rolling room and urged the branch not to be complacent, but to more actively unite the masses and work with them to create even higher achievements.

### 张市纸烟厂卷烟室  党员带头克服浪费  市委通报号召各厂学习

　　张市纸烟厂卷烟室  党员带头克服浪费
    市委通报号召各厂学习
    张家口市纸烟厂卷烟室过去存在着严重的浪费现象。据该厂支部书记报告，该厂自去年“八一”开工至去年年底五个月中，共损失盘纸一三一点五九七盘（损失率为百分之四点二六），每盘价以二四五、○○○元计，共合人民币一九、三九六、一六○元。折合小米三七、三○○斤。出剔庄烟共七十三大箱（这些烟均以半价售出），计损失三一、○二五、○○○元，折米六二、○五○斤。以上两项共计损失小米九九、三五○斤，超过该室三十个工人五个月工资开支（三八、七五○斤）的一倍半。损失原因，据调查为：一、卷车司机随便脱离岗位，机车发生故障不能马上制止。二、电烙铁不经常擦；烟丝内又有未切碎之烟梗均容易挂破盘纸。三、机车坏了不找技工修理，自己找不到毛病擅自修理，试车时增加损失。四、浆子罐不常揩擦，使卷纸黏不上浆糊。
    今年一月十日，纸烟厂支部与省、市工会工作组共同研究，根据以上情况，确定以卷烟室为重点，发动党员群众开展生产节约运动。干部们下去，分别先找四、五号机车上的党员进行个别动员，号召他们完成党所给予的任务，在不影响产品数量与质量的情况下，打破减少损耗的纪录。动员后的第一天（一月十二号），于朝品的四号机车损失率即降为百分之一点○八，产量居全室七台车的第二位。纪书明的五号机车损失率由一月上旬的百分之三点三降至百分之二点一，产量则为全室第一。
    领导上马上将这个新纪录传达到每辆机车的党员与司机中去，用以鼓动大家。结果，党员群众特别是各机车司机都暗暗地加了劲。工长苑宝珍同志积极负责，不仅每日上班时修理机器，还及时到各车间进行指导与检查。这样，从一月十二日到十四日短短三天中，就收到不少的成绩：盘纸的平均耗损率由去年十二月份的百分之三点八一，降为百分之一点九三。四号机车的损失率十四日已降到百分之点五二创造了新纪录，若与十二月相较，每月可节约小米六、一二三斤。烟支耗损率也由过去的百分之点七降为百分之点一二。同时三天产量超过原计划（每日九十箱）四十三大箱，烟支耗损每月可节约剔装烟十一大箱（按半价）折小米九、一五一斤。两项共计小米一五、二七四斤超过全室一月开支工资额的一倍。
    在这三天的突击工作的过程中，得到的经验是：一、党、政、工的领导思想与工作步调必须一致；二、领导上集中力量，突破一点，取得经验，推动全盘，这种领导方法证明是成功的。如卷烟室起初只抓住了两个司机（党员）搞通思想，帮助他们取得成绩后，马上表扬，推广，结果引起全室都卷入了生产节约的热潮；三、在生产节约运动中，党员起模范，带动群众打破某些同志认为“党在工厂中起不了作用”的错误认识，密切了党群关系，提高党在群众中的威信；四、领导上及时掌握产量与耗损的精确统计数字，以这些具体事实去教育工人，工人才容易接受，否则只空喊号召是起不了多大作用的。
    现张家口市委会对该厂卷烟室党员带动群众节约国家财产克服严重浪费现象已予通报表扬，号召各工厂支部党员向他们学习。此外，责成该厂支书焦大海同志对卷烟室全体工人同志致敬，并号召该支部不要自满，要更积极的团结群众与群众一起为创造更高的成绩而努力。
