	Respected Chairman Mao:

	On the occasion of our commemoration of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, we express our sincere greetings and highest respect for your hard work and great achievements in discussing and concluding the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with Marshal Stalin.

	This year, we will commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day by supporting the liberation of Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, intensifying production, practicing strict economy, and strengthening our work and study. Under your wise leadership, we are deeply convinced that the Kuomintang remnant bandits will be eliminated and all difficulties can be overcome. When the victory of the revolution is consolidated and production and construction are restored and developed, the welfare of women in our country will be gradually improved.

	We pledge to work under your leadership for the construction of a new China, for the happy life of the Chinese people, women and children, and for the cause of peace for all mankind.

(II) Telegram of Respect to Marshal Stalin
	Respected Marshal Stalin:

	As we commemorate "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, we express our sincere gratitude and highest respect for the great friendly assistance given to the people of our country by you and the Soviet people in the recently signed Sino-Soviet new treaty and new agreements!

	Thanks to your leadership, Soviet women have made brilliant achievements in the battle to defend the socialist motherland and in the great construction from socialism to communism, creating a model for women all over the world!

	We want to learn from Soviet women and work hard to build a new democratic China! We must further strengthen our unity with Soviet women and peace-loving and democratic women all over the world, and strive to defend world lasting peace and people's democracy!

(III) Telegram to the Women's International Democratic Federation
	Dear friends of the Women's International Democratic Federation:

	With joyful feelings, we celebrate the first "March 8th" International Working Women's Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China in the capital of the People's China.

	In the past year, under your leadership, the international democratic women's movement has made great progress. In particular, the convocation of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference is of great significance in strengthening the unity of Asian and world democratic women and promoting the Asian women's liberation movement. As we celebrate "March 8th," let us express our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to you.

	We will certainly respond to your call to commemorate "March 8th" by continuing to strengthen our unity with peace-loving and democratic women all over the world, shattering the conspiracies of war provocateurs, defending world lasting peace and people's democracy, and defending the rights of women and children.

(IV) Telegram to Women in Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island
	Sisters in Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island:

	Just as the whole country is celebrating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, we send our cordial greetings to you – sisters who are still under the oppression and trampling of imperialism and the Kuomintang remnant bandits!

	Dear sisters! Our People's Liberation Army is bound to liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island. Your bright days are coming soon. We hope that you will continue the fighting spirit of resisting aggressors and oppressors in the past, unite closely with the local people, and prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army when it arrives, thoroughly eliminate the remnant bandits, and complete the great cause of national liberation.

(V) Telegram of Respect to the People's Liberation Army
	To Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, transferred to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army:

	Today, we celebrate our own festival with victorious and joyful feelings. Chinese women have been liberated from thousands of years of slavery. We deeply know that our liberation is inseparable from your heroic battles. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, you drove the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits out of mainland China and liberated most of the territory; wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, the women there are liberated. We and our future generations will forever remember your great contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and Chinese women.

	We hope and firmly believe that you can step up preparations and, in the near future, march into Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, destroy the last nest of the Kuomintang bandits, and eliminate the aggressive forces of US imperialism in China. We women in Beijing, together with all the people, will strive to intensify production and support you in order to complete the final liberation of all China as soon as possible. Special telegram of condolence and greetings!
