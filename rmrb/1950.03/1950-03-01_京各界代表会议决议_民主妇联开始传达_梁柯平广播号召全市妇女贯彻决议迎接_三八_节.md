【Beijing News】 The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation has begun to disseminate the spirit and resolutions of the Second Session of the Second Beijing People's Representatives Conference. The representatives of the Federation who attended the People's Representatives Conference held a discussion yesterday (the 28th) and decided that the representatives should disseminate the information to relevant agencies and organizations separately. Liang Keping, the Minister of Propaganda and Education of the Federation, also broadcast on Beijing People's Broadcasting Station yesterday, calling on all women in the city to implement the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference to welcome this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day. She said that Beijing's 1950 municipal work plan is to serve the broad masses of people, especially the working people, and also to serve the broad masses of women, especially working women. For example, the government plans to add woolen mills, carpet factories, dyeing and ironing factories, and sack factories, which will absorb a considerable number of female workers, and at the same time can drive a part of the family sideline. In her broadcast, she called on all women in the city to work together with the people of the city to implement the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference. She called on women who have been organized to the production front and those who will be organized to the production front to actively produce, improve technology, strive to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. Female workers in state-owned factories should actively participate in the democratic management of factories, participate in production competitions and new record movements. She also called on intellectual women and women from other strata to actively participate in production, culture, education, municipal and other construction undertakings.
