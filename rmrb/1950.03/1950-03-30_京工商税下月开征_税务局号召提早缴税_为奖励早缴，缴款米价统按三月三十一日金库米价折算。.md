[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipality's Industrial and Commercial Tax for the second half of 1949 will begin to be levied on April 1st. In order to facilitate tax payment calculation and adapt to the current stable price situation, and to encourage early payment, the Municipal Tax Bureau has decided that the rice price for this payment will be uniformly converted according to the Treasury rice price on March 31st. After receiving the notification, all taxpayers who pay the entire amount in RMB can go directly to any designated collection point of the relevant tax sub-bureau to pay. Those who hold tax-deductible rice coupons can go to the relevant tax sub-bureau to pay one jin for one jin. Those who hold only part of the tax-deductible rice coupons should first go to the relevant tax sub-bureau to pay the rice coupons, and for the insufficient portion, exchange for a new payment slip and then go to the collection point to pay in RMB. In order to solve some of the current financial difficulties of the municipal government, the Municipal Tax Bureau is specifically calling on all industrial and commercial households to display their spirit of patriotism, and under the principle of voluntariness, the tax sub-bureaus will negotiate with each household, calling on everyone to pay as early as possible.

Zhao Zishang, Director of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, also made a statement on this matter, saying: "The industrial and commercial tax in Beijing Municipality for the second half of last year was delayed until April of this year to be levied. This is caused by our passive work in the past year, and also by the government's consideration of everyone purchasing public bonds, which created difficulties. If it is delayed further, it will inevitably seriously affect the realization of the government's budget for this year. Therefore, all industrial and commercial households must complete this collection task. Everyone has recently purchased public bonds, and it is somewhat difficult to pay this relatively concentrated seasonal tax again, but this difficulty is only temporary. The government is currently also facing financial difficulties, so I hope that everyone can overcome their own personal difficulties and complete the glorious patriotic task as soon as possible. Currently, the construction work in Beijing is underway, and projects such as dredging rivers and sewers and repairing roads are in progress. These projects require a large amount of money financially and must be completed before the rainy season. Therefore, collecting this tax as soon as possible is even more urgent. The government's difficulties are consistent with the people's difficulties. Therefore, I hope that all industrial and commercial households in the city can understand the government's difficulties and strive to pay taxes early within the time limit."

　　京工商税下月开征
    税务局号召提早缴税
    为奖励早缴，缴款米价统按三月三十一日金库米价折算。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市一九四九年下半年度工商业税将于四月一日开始征收。市税务局为使缴款计算方便及适应目前物价平稳状况，奖励早缴起见，决定此次缴款米价统按三月三十一日金库米价折算。各纳税义务人于接到通知书后，其全部持人民券纳税者，可迳往各该税务分局所指定的任一代收地点缴款；其持有纳税折米券者，可到各该税务分局以一斤抵一斤缴纳，如持有一部纳税折米券者应先到各该税务分局缴纳折米券，其不足部分，换取新缴款书后，再往代收地点以人民券缴纳。市税务局为解决当前市府财政上的部分困难，特号召各工商业户发挥爱国主义精神，在自愿的原则下，由各税务分局与各户进行协商，号召大家尽早缴款。
    京市税务局赵子尚局长并为此发表谈话称：京市去年下半年的工商业税拖到今年四月才征收，这是我们过去一年来工作被动所造成的，也是政府为照顾大家购买公债而造成的困难，如再拖下去，势必严重影响政府今年度的概算的实现，所以各工商业户必须完成此次的征收任务。大家最近刚购买了公债，再缴纳此次比较集中的季节性税款是有些困难的，但这个困难只是暂时的。政府目前在财政上也有困难，因此希望大家能克服自己个人的困难，早日完成光荣的爱国任务。目前北京市的建设工作正在展开，疏浚河流、下水道，修补马路等工程正在进行，这些工程在财政上需要一大笔钱，而且必须在雨季以前赶完。因此，早日征齐这次税款更是迫不及待的。现在政府的困难与人民的困难是一致的，因此，希望全市工商业户能体谅政府的困难，在限期内尽量争取提早缴税。
