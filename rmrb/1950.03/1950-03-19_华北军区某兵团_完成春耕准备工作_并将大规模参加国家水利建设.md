    Completes Spring Plowing Preparations
    And Will Participate in Large-Scale National Water Conservancy Construction
    [Report from this newspaper] A certain corps of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has largely completed its production preparations for this year and is about to embark on a large-scale production movement. The corps has prepared more than 90,000 mu of land. In addition to some farm tools being made by its own iron factory, it has also ordered some new-style farm tools from the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition. The troops' existing mules and horses can meet all the livestock power needs for this year's agricultural production. Fertilizers and seeds for the irrigated land have all been purchased, and some have already begun to send manure to the fields. At the same time, it plans to participate in national water conservancy and irrigation projects with 3.2 million workdays, which has been approved by the local government and a contract has been signed. The engineering design and surveying have now been completed, and a portion of the water lifting equipment has been prepared. Most of the power equipment is electric motors and diesel engines, or powered by animal traction. The troops participating in this year's production are actively conducting production education, and all officers and soldiers are full of confidence and enthusiasm in completing the production tasks. Currently, the corps' production committee is inspecting various production preparations and adjusting production plans.
