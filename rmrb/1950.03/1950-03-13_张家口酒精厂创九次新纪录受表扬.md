　　Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory Commended for Setting Nine New Records

　　[Our Newspaper] Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory has created a new record for the ninth time in forty-two days. For this, the Municipal Industrial Bureau, the CPC Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have respectively issued circulars of commendation. Under the same conditions of personnel, equipment, and raw materials, from January 16th to the end of February, the factory increased its daily alcohol production from 1130 jin to 1290 jin, and its product yield from 24.56 percent to 28.04 percent, greatly reducing product costs and increasing output.

　　The reason for obtaining the above achievements is that all employees of the factory, under the unified leadership of the Party, government, and trade union, have brought into play their consciousness as masters, carefully operated, and worked hard unremittingly. Secondly, the factory director Chen Zongde and deputy factory director Ma Zhe have gone deep into the workshops for specific leadership, ensuring the workers' consistently full production enthusiasm. Currently, the factory's new record creation movement is still continuing.

　　张家口酒精厂创九次新纪录受表扬
    【本报讯】张家口酒精厂在四十二天中，第九次创造新纪录。为此，市府工业局、中共张家口市委会、市总工会曾分别通报表扬。该厂在人员、设备、原料相等的条件下，自一月十六日至二月底，日产酒精量由一一三○斤增至一二九○斤，产品率由百分之二四·五六，提高到二八·○四，大大降低了产品成本，提高了产量。
    获得上述成绩的原因，是由于该厂全体职工在党、政、工统一领导下，发挥了主人翁的自觉性，精心操作，努力不懈。其次，是该厂陈宗德厂长、马哲副厂长深入车间具体领导，保证了职工经常饱满的生产情绪。现该厂创新纪录运动尚在继续进行中。
