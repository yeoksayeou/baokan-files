　　Northwest Steel Company Improves Coke Quality
    Steel Costs Significantly Reduced
    Company Rewards Advanced Producers with 7,000 Jin of Millet
    [Our Newspaper] The Taiyuan Northwest Steel Company's coking department launched a red banner competition. Thanks to the guidance of Soviet experts and the hard work of the employees, operational methods were improved, creating a new record of reducing coal washing ash content to 9.62% and coke ash content to 14.6%. This laid the foundation for improving coke quality and reducing steel costs. To this end, the company specially rewarded advanced producers with 7,000 jin of millet. Since liberation, the company had consistently experienced coke ash content above 18% due to the high ash content of washed coal. At the end of last year, workers spontaneously picked up stones to try to reduce the ash content, but the effect was not significant. During the 33-day red banner competition from January 10th to February 12th this year, workers' production enthusiasm was generally high. Ge Dongsheng, after dedicated research, first proposed the suggestion of cleaning the screen bottom of the coal washing machine before starting the car, and under the leadership of Feng Chengrong, the operation was carried out, resulting in a significant reduction in ash content. After promoting this advanced method, the average record of coal washing ash content in late January was reduced to 12.99%, a decrease of 3.75% compared to December of last year. Subsequently, with the guidance of Soviet experts, increasing the amount of water and adding more hard coal, the average record of coal washing ash content was further reduced to 11.86%. Zhang Jianye's team even created a new record of 9.62% for the lowest coal washing ash content, and the coke ash content also followed suit, creating a new record of 14.6% for the lowest ash content. On this basis, continuing to improve operational methods, the average record of coal washing ash content in February was further reduced to 10.56%, and the average record of coke ash content also dropped from 17.86% in January to 15.606%, surpassing the level of the Japanese invaders and the Yan bandit rule era (the average during the Japanese puppet era was 17.7, and during the Yan bandit era it was 21), greatly improving the quality of coke and reducing the cost of steel. According to statistics, in the past, it took 1.6 to 1.8 tons of coke to smelt one ton of pig iron, but now, due to the improved quality of coke, it only takes 1.3 tons. Therefore, for every 1% reduction in coke ash content, the company can save costs equivalent to more than 13,000 jin of millet per day. To reward this production achievement, the company held a grand celebration on the 13th of this month, and awarded advanced producers 7,000 jin of millet as encouragement.

### 西北钢铁公司焦炭质量提高  钢铁成本显著降低  公司奖励先进生产者小米七千斤

　　西北钢铁公司焦炭质量提高
    钢铁成本显著降低
    公司奖励先进生产者小米七千斤
    【本报讯】太原西北钢铁公司炼焦部开展红旗竞赛运动，由于苏联专家的指导及职工们努力钻研，操作方法得到改进，创造了洗煤灰分降低至百分之九·六二，焦炭灰分降低至百分之一四·六的新纪录。奠定了提高焦炭质量、降低钢铁成本的基础。为此，公司特奖给生产先进者小米七千斤。该公司自解放以来，由于洗煤灰分高，致焦炭灰分总是在百分之一八以上。去年年底，工人曾自动捡石头，想办法降低灰分，但效果不大。在今年一月十日至二月十二日三十三天的红旗竞赛运动中，工人生产情绪普遍高涨，葛冬生经过专心研究，首先提出开车前应清扫洗煤机筛底的建议，并由冯成荣领导操作，结果灰分显著降低。推广这一先进方法后，一月下旬洗煤灰分平均纪录已降为百分之一二·九九，较去年十二月降低百分之三·七五。继又经过苏联专家的指导，加大水量，多放硬炭，洗煤灰分平均纪录再降为一一·八六，而张建业班更创造了洗煤灰分百分之九·六二的最低新纪录，焦炭灰分也随之创造了百分之一四·六的最低新纪录。在这一基础上，继续改进操作方法，二月份洗煤灰分平均纪录再降为百分之一○·五六，焦炭灰分平均纪录也由一月份的百分之一七·八六降为一五·六○六，超过日寇及阎匪统治时代的水平（日伪时代平均为一七·七，阎匪时为二一），大大提高了焦炭的质量，降低了钢铁的成本。据统计：过去化炼一吨生铁需要焦炭一·六吨至一·八吨，现在由于焦炭质量提高仅需一·三吨。所以焦炭每降低百分之一的灰分，公司每日即可节省成本折小米一万三千余斤。该公司为奖励这一生产成绩，于本月十三日隆重举行庆祝会，并奖给生产先进者小米七千斤以资鼓励。
