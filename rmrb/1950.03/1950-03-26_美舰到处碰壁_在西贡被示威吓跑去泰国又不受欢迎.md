　　US Ships Bumping Into Walls Everywhere
    Driven Away by Demonstrations in Saigon, Unwelcome in Thailand

　　The US Seventh Fleet hastily left Saigon in the face of large-scale student demonstrations and was preparing to sail to Bangkok, planning to "pay tribute" to the King of Thailand with fifty fighter planes. However, after the student demonstrations in Saigon, Bangkok's bourgeois newspapers also expressed their unwelcomeness to the US fleet's "visit." According to a United Press report from Bangkok on the 23rd, the Bangkok English-language newspaper "The Mirror" argued in an editorial on the 23rd that the visit of the US aircraft carrier "Boxer" and its planes to Thailand was an "unwise" act. While the newspaper expressed gratitude for the US authorities' "tribute," it also said: "We cannot help but ask whether it is appropriate at this time." The newspaper mentioned the demonstrations in Saigon, believing that "a wrong move" by the US in Saigon had caused Bao Dai's "prestige to suffer severely." The newspaper complained that the US State Department did not truly understand the current situation in Asia, resulting in "a great mistake." The newspaper finally requested the US to "withdraw the US government's kindness on its own."

　　美舰到处碰壁
    在西贡被示威吓跑去泰国又不受欢迎
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国第七舰队在大规模的学生示威面前匆匆离开西贡，正准备开往曼谷，并预定以五十架战斗机向泰国王“致敬”。但在西贡学生示威后，曼谷的资产阶级报纸也对美国舰队的“拜访”不表欢迎。据合众社曼谷二十三日电：曼谷的英文报纸“镜报”二十三日社论中认为：美国“拳师”号航空母舰及飞机的访问泰国，是“不聪明”的行为。该报虽然对美国当局的“致敬”盛意表示感谢，但同时又说：“我们不能不问，在目前这种时候是否适当。”该报提及西贡的示威游行时认为：由于美国在西贡的“一个错误的举动”，使保大的“声望受到严重的损失”。该报埋怨美国国务院对目前亚洲局势没有真正的了解，以致“造成大错”。该报最后要求美国“自行收回美国政府的盛意”。
