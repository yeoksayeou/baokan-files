　　Introducing a Good Movie

　　《Pavlov》
    (Starting February 24th, this film will be shown at the Ping'an, Zhonghe, and Hongxing cinemas in the city. The film has Chinese subtitles.)

    The film "Pavlov" realistically depicts the life of Ivan Pavlov, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He made great discoveries in the field of biology, opening the door to the convenience of neurological medical treatment. The film vividly and popularly presents Pavlov's theory of "conditioned reflexes" to the audience in a way that is well-received by the masses.

    Pavlov defended the achievements and honor of Russian science. This patriotism is manifested in his brilliant speeches when he received an honorary degree from Cambridge University in England and when he went to the United States to lecture. He vividly refuted the fallacies of Western idealist scholars. He said: "The only difference between a miner and a king is that one of them is useful."

    The Tsarist Russian era did not provide this great scholar with any convenient conditions for his work, forcing him to use his own living expenses to maintain his research in difficult times. On the contrary, the Bolshevik Party and its great leaders Lenin and Stalin were very concerned about this scholar. Pavlov received strong assistance and support during the Soviet regime, and finally achieved brilliant achievements that benefited mankind.

    This film won the Stalin First Class Prize for its rich ideological content and outstanding artistic creation.

　　《巴甫洛夫》
    （二月二十四日起在本市《平安》、《中和》、《红星》三影院公映。片上印有中文字幕。
    《巴甫洛夫》这部影片，很真实地显示了苏联科学院会员伊万·巴甫洛夫的一生。他在生物学界有伟大的发现，给与了神经病医疗领域开辟了方便之门。影片以广大群众喜闻乐见的形式，把巴甫洛夫关于“条件反射”的学说通俗生动地表现在观众面前。
    巴甫洛夫保卫了俄罗斯科学的成就和荣誉。这种爱国主义精神表现在他在英国剑桥大学受领名誉学位时，及赴美国讲学时的精湛的发言中间。他生动地批驳了欧美唯心论学者的谬说。他说：“矿工与国王之间只有一点是不同的——其中一个是有益的。”
    沙皇俄国时代没有给与这个伟大学者在任何工作上以方便条件，使得他在困难的时候不得不用自己的生活费用移用于维持自己的研究。相反的，布尔什维克党及其伟大领导者列宁、斯大林对于这位学者却十分关心。巴甫洛夫在苏维埃政权年代里得到了有力的援助与支持，终于获得了造福人类的辉煌成就。
    这部影片曾因思想内容的丰富及艺术创作上的杰出而获斯大林一等奖。
