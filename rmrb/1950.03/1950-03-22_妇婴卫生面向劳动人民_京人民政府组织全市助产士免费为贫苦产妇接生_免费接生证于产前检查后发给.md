　　Maternal and Child Health Oriented Towards the Working People
    Beijing Municipal Government Organizes Citywide Midwives to Provide Free Delivery Services for Impoverished Mothers
    Free Delivery Certificates Issued After Prenatal Checkups
    [Beijing News Agency Report] In order to promote maternal and child healthcare, the Public Health Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to establish a new department specifically responsible for managing maternal and child health work throughout the city, which has now begun operations. To ensure the smooth progress of this work and to enable the majority of mothers to receive scientific delivery methods, the Public Health Bureau has joined forces with the Municipal Women's Federation and various mass organizations to formulate a program for maternal and child healthcare work in the city, enlisting the participation of obstetricians and midwives from public and private health institutions throughout the city.

    According to statistics from the Public Health Bureau, in the past year, deliveries attended by physicians, midwives, and trained traditional birth attendants accounted for 58.16% of all births. 41.77% of births still used old-fashioned methods. Compared to 1948, although the number of scientific deliveries increased by 7.66%, deliveries using old-fashioned methods still accounted for a large number, resulting in a high infant mortality rate. According to the findings of the Health Bureau's investigation and research, the reason why the number of non-scientific deliveries has not decreased is primarily because the economic strength of the majority of working people and impoverished citizens is currently insufficient to afford the services of physicians or midwives for delivery.

    Based on this specific situation, the Public Health Bureau has begun to organize a maternal and child healthcare network in the city, intending to mobilize approximately 300 obstetricians and midwives from public and private health institutions citywide to participate. Central groups will be formed by district, organizing local practicing obstetricians and midwives to participate as members. As of now, groups have been formed in districts one, two, five, six, and twelve. The work of the members includes prenatal check-ups, deliveries, home visits, vaccinations, birth report surveys, and health education. If a member is an obstetrician, they should assist other members in handling illnesses, difficult labor, and postpartum check-ups. Assuming each midwife can care for 120 mothers per year, it is possible to meet the demand for scientific midwifery in the urban area. The Health Bureau has also formulated "Measures for Free Delivery Subsidies for the Maternal and Child Healthcare Network," providing free or half-price delivery services for impoverished mothers, with the government providing subsidies to the midwives: provisionally set at 15 jin of millet per delivery for free services, and 7.5 jin for half-price services. The quota for free delivery subsidies is provisionally set at 1,000 per month for the entire city, distributed among the districts according to population size or workload, with appropriate consideration given to mothers in the suburban areas. To encourage prenatal check-ups and reduce difficult labor, the right to free services will not be granted without prenatal check-ups. Impoverished pregnant women who are seven months pregnant or more, and have proof of prenatal check-ups from a midwife and certification from the district office, can apply to the central group in each district. After the central group's free delivery subsidy review committee approves the application, a free delivery permit will be issued, and the midwife can provide free delivery services. After gaining preliminary experience, this work will be extended to the suburban areas.

　　妇婴卫生面向劳动人民
    京人民政府组织全市助产士免费为贫苦产妇接生
    免费接生证于产前检查后发给
    【京市新闻处讯】本市人民政府公共卫生局为推动妇婴保健工作，已决定增设一个科，专门负责管理全市妇婴卫生工作，现已开始办公。为了这一工作能够顺利展开，并使大多数产妇能得到科学方法接生，公共卫生局已联合市妇联及各群众团体着手组织本市妇婴保健工作纲，吸收全市各公私立卫生机构产科医师及助产士参加工作。
    据公共卫生局统计，过去一年出生婴儿中，经医师、助产士及已受训产婆接生者，占所有出生婴儿的百分之五十八点一六，百分之四十一点七七的出生婴儿均是沿用旧式方法接生的，与一九四八年比较，虽接受科学接生的数目是增加了百分之七点六六，但用旧式方法接生的仍占着很大的数目，以致造成高度的婴儿死亡率。据卫生局调查研究结果：不经科学接生者数目未能减少原因，除因卫生常识不够普及外，主要是因为大部劳动人民及贫苦市民目前的经济力量还不能延请医师或助产士接生。
    根据这个具体情况，公共卫生局已着手组织本市妇婴保健工作网；拟动员全市公私立卫生机构产科医师助产士约三百余人参加，按区组成中心组，组织当地执业产科医师及助产士参加，充作组员。截至目前为止，已有一、二、五、六、十二五个区组成。组员工作为：产前检查、接生、访视、种痘、出生报告调查及宣传教育等；如组员为产科医师应协助其他组员处理疾病、难产及产后检查工作。以每一助产士每年能照料产妇一百二十人计，是可以满足城区科学助产要求的。卫生局并拟定了“妇婴保健工作网免费接生补助津贴办法”，免费或半费为贫苦产妇接生，由政府予助产士以津贴：暂定为每名小米十五斤，半费者七斤半。免费接生补助名额暂规定全市每月一千名，各区据人口多少或工作多少分配之；并适当的照顾郊区产妇。为了鼓励孕妇产前检查，减少难产起见，免费权利非经产前检查者不得享受。凡妊娠七个月以上的贫苦孕妇，并有助产士产前检查证明及区公所的证明者，均可向各区中心组申请，经中心组免费接生补助审核委员会审查合格后即可发予免费接生许可证，助产士即可免费予以接生。此项工作于取得初步经验后，即可推广到郊区。
