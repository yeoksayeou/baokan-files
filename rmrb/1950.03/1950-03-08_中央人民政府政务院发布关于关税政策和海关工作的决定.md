Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: The Central People's Government Council has issued a decision on tariff policy and customs work (approved by the 17th Government Affairs Meeting of the State Council on January 27, 1950), the full text of which is as follows:

    The Central People's Government Council believes that: In the past hundred years, imperialists have infringed upon China's customs autonomy. They used armed force and enslaving treaties to force China to open treaty ports, engage in foreign trade, and stipulate extremely low tariffs or even tariff exemptions for imported goods. Various imperialist countries have fully utilized these privileges to import large quantities of manufactured goods into China, absorb cheap raw materials, and use this to strangle and hinder the free development of China's national industry, making China a backward semi-colony subordinate to foreign countries for a long time.

    In order to protect their privileges in foreign trade and to obtain guarantees for reparations and interest on their enslaving treaties and predatory loans, the imperialists long controlled the power of China's customs administration and tariff revenue and expenditure. The main responsible personnel of the customs were all British and American, and business was conducted in English in various customs houses. The salaries of foreign employees were much higher than those of Chinese employees, and they enjoyed all the special preferential conditions that Chinese employees could not obtain. The so-called "abolition of unequal treaties" in 1943 did not truly realize customs autonomy, but merely transferred the management power of the customs from one imperialist to another, with Americans replacing the British as the highest officials of the customs.

    After the imperialists seized the power of China's customs, they continued to expand and damage China's sovereignty, such as incorporating duties unrelated to customs, such as ensuring the safety of shipping and patrolling the national coastal borders, into the scope of customs management. They used China's customs revenue and other income to build ports, lighthouses, and other navigational aids. These facilities were inherently useful to China, but were primarily used to ensure the safety and convenience of foreign transportation, rather than to facilitate China's fragile shipping industry, which could not compete with foreign capitalist companies. Furthermore, customs anti-smuggling and national defense security work were originally two completely different tasks, but they used the name of anti-smuggling to place the national defense security work of guarding the national coastal borders under the control of the customs in some places.

    Due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the above-mentioned unequal and non-autonomous state has come to an end, and China's independent sovereignty in tariff policy and autonomy in managing customs affairs have been recovered.

    The Central People's Government Council believes that: Under the current conditions, the supervision and certain controls exercised by the national customs work and national foreign trade work should play an important role in restoring and developing China's people's economy. Customs tariffs must protect national production and protect the competition between domestic products and foreign goods.

    The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government must be a unified, centralized, and independent national agency. The General Administration of Customs is responsible for exercising actual supervision and management over the import and export of various goods and currencies, collecting tariffs, and fighting smuggling, thereby protecting China from the economic aggression of capitalist countries.

    All duties not directly related to customs, such as: managing ports, dredging rivers, building navigational aids, patrolling national coastal borders, etc., shall be transferred from the customs to other relevant agencies.

    In order to realize the above-mentioned tariff policy and organize the tasks of customs work, the State Council hereby makes the following decisions:

    1. Approve the "Provisional Organizational Regulations of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government."

    2. Relieve the following duties unrelated to customs:

    １. The duties related to the management of seaports, river channels, lighthouse buoys, meteorological reporting, and other navigational aids, together with their staff, materials, and equipment, shall be transferred to the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government or the port authority of the city.

    ２. The duties of patrolling the national coastal borders and armed naval vessels shall be transferred to the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, except for some small boats necessary for the customs to perform its duties and carry out anti-smuggling work at the ports.

    The General Administration of Customs is responsible for discussing with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Security the methods and dates for transferring the above-mentioned work and its personnel, materials, and equipment.

    3. Before the implementation of the new customs tariff, the General Administration of Customs is allowed to temporarily use the 1948 import tariff for imported goods and the 1934 export tariff (1945 revised edition) for exported goods, but some aspects must be revised by the State Council of the Central People's Government.

    4. A new customs tariff for import and export goods of the People's Republic of China must be formulated. In order to formulate a new customs tariff, it is decided to organize a special committee under the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council shall send one representative to serve as the director of the committee. The Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Food Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the General Administration of Customs shall each send one representative to form the committee. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council is entrusted to approve the staffing of the committee.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the work, the director of the committee is authorized to draw experts from other departments participating in the committee to participate in the formulation of the customs tariff. It is stipulated that the committee must complete the above-mentioned work before August 1, 1950.

    5. When formulating the customs tariff, the special committee shall carry out its work according to the following basic principles.

    １. For industrial products and semi-finished products that can be produced in large quantities domestically or that cannot be produced in large quantities for the time being but have the potential for future development, the customs tax rate should be set higher than the difference between the cost of the imported goods and the cost of similar goods in our country when importing the same goods, in order to protect national national production.

    ２. Levy higher tax rates on all luxury goods and non-essential goods.

    ３. The tax rate for production equipment, industrial raw materials, agricultural machinery, grain seeds, and fertilizers that are rarely produced or cannot be produced domestically should be low or exempt from tariffs.

    ４. All necessary scientific books and books on the prevention and control of agricultural diseases and insect pests, as well as the import of certain medicines that cannot be produced domestically or cannot be replaced by domestic medicines, shall be exempt from or reduced in tariffs.

    ５. The customs tariff has two tax rates for imported goods: For countries that have trade treaties or agreements with the People's Republic of China, a general normal tax rate should be stipulated; for countries that do not have trade treaties or agreements with the People's Republic of China, a tax rate higher than the general rate should be stipulated.

    ６. In order to develop the production of our country's export goods, the export of all semi-finished products and processed raw materials encouraged by the Central People's Government shall be subject to very low tax rates or be exempt from export taxes.

    6. The customs regulations of the People's Republic of China must be formulated to determine the organization, powers, and responsibilities of the customs. It is specifically decided that the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government shall submit a draft of the customs regulations to the State Council of the Central People's Government for review before July 1, 1950.

　　中央人民政府政务院发布关于关税政策和海关工作的决定
    【新华社北京七日电】中央人民政府政务院顷发布关于关税政策和海关工作的决定（一九五○年一月二十七日政务院第十七次政务会议通过），全文如下：
    中央人民政府政务院认为：在过去一百多年当中，帝国主义者侵犯了我国的海关自主权，他们用武装力量及奴役式的条约，强迫我国开辟商埠，进行对外贸易，规定以极低的关税甚至免除关税输入商品。各帝国主义国家，曾充分利用了这些特权，大量地向我国输入生产品，吸收廉价原料，并借此绞杀和阻碍了我国民族工业的自由发展，使我国长期变为落后的从属外国的半殖民地。
    帝国主义者为了保护其在对外贸易方面的特权，为了对其奴役性的条约和掠夺性的借款取得赔款与债息的担保，曾长期地掌握了我国海关管理和关税收支的大权，海关主要负责人员，全部由英美人担任，在各海关用英语办事行文，外国职员的薪金比中国职员高得多，并且享受一切中国职员所得不到的特殊优待条件。一九四三年的所谓“取消不平等条约”，并没有真正实现海关的自主，只不过是把海关的管理权从一个帝国主义者转到另一个帝国主义者手里，海关的最高官员由美国人代替了英国人。
    帝国主义者掌握我国海关大权后，继续扩大损害我国主权，如将与海关无关的职务，如保证航运的安全和巡卫国境海岸等，也揽入海关管理范围之内，用我国海关的和其他的收入，建筑港口、灯塔及其他助航设备，这些设备，对我国固有一定用处，但首先是利用来保证外国运输的安全和方便，而不是用来便利我国脆弱的不能与外国资本主义公司进行竞争的航运。再，海关辑私和国防保卫工作，原是完全不同的两种任务，但他们利用缉私的名义，在有些地方竟将警卫国境海岸的国防保卫工作也由海关掌握起来。
    由于中国人民大革命的伟大胜利，结束了以上各种不平等与不自主的状态，收回了中国在关税政策方面的独立主权及管理海关事业的自主权。
    中央人民政府政务院认为：在目前条件下，国家海关工作与国家对外贸易工作上所进行的监督与某种管制，在恢复与发展我国人民经济中，应起重要的作用。海关税则，必需保护国家生产，必需保护国内生产品与外国商品的竞争。
    中央人民政府海关总署，必须是统一集中的和独立自主的国家机关，海关总署负责对各种货物及货币的输入输出执行实际的监督管理，征收关税，与走私进行斗争，以此来保护我国不受资本主义国家的经济侵略。
    所有和海关无直接关系的职务，如：管理港口、疏浚河道、建筑助航设备、巡卫国境海岸等工作，均应由海关移交给其他有关机关。
    为了实现上述关税政策及组织海关工作的任务，政务院特作如下决定：
    一、批准“中央人民政府海关总署试行组织条例”。
    二、解除下列各项与海关无关的职务：
    １、关于管理海港河道、灯塔浮标、气象报导等助航设备的职务，连同其工作人员、物资、器材全部移交中央人民政府交通部或市的港务局。
    ２、巡卫国境海岸的职务及武装舰艇，全部移交中央人民政府公安部，但为了便于海关执行职务及在口岸上进行缉私工作所必需的一些小型船艇在外。
    责成海关总署与交通部、公安部共同商讨移交上述工作及其人员、物资的办法和日期。
    三、准许海关总署在新海关税则未规定施行前，在输入货物方面暂用一九四八年的进口税则，在输出货物方面暂用一九三四年的出口税则（一九四五年修正本），但某些方面须经过中央人民政府政务院的订正。
    四、必须制定中华人民共和国输入输出货物的新海关税则，为了制定新的海关税则，决定在中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会下组织一个专门委员会，由政务院财政经济委员会派代表一人任委员会主任，中央人民政府贸易部、财政部、重工业部、燃料工业部、纺织工业部、轻工业部、铁道部、农业部、交通部、食品工业部、邮电部及海关总署各派代表一人组成之，并委托政务院财政经济委员会批准该委员会的人员编制。
    为了工作进行顺利起见，给该委员会主任以权力，得由参加委员会其他各部抽调专家，参加制定海关税则的工作。规定该委员会必需在一九五○年八月一日以前完成上述工作。
    五、于制定海关税则时，专门委员会得按下列各项基本原则，进行工作。
    １、在国内能大量生产的或者暂时还不能大量生产但将来有发展可能的工业品及半制品，于进口同样的这些商品时，海关税率应规定高于该项商品的成本与我国同样货品的成本间之差额，以保护国家民族生产。
    ２、对于一切奢侈品和非必需品，订征更高的税率。
    ３、在国内生产很少或者不能生产的生产设备器材、工业原料、农业机械、粮食种籽及肥料等，其税率要低或免征关税。
    ４、凡一切必需的科学图书与防治农业病虫害等书籍，以及若干国内不能生产的或国内药品所不能代替的药品的输入，免征或减征关税。
    ５、海关税则对进口货物有两种税率：对于凡与中华人民共和国有贸易条约或协定的国家，应该规定一般的正常的税率；对于凡与中华人民共和国没有贸易条约或协定关系的国家，要规定比一般较高的税率。
    ６、为了发展我国的出口货物的生产，对于经由中央人民政府所奖励的一切半制品及加工原料的输出，只订很低的税率或免税输出。
    六、必须制定中华人民共和国的海关法规，确定海关的组织、权限与职责等，特决定由中央人民政府海关总署于一九五○年七月一日以前将海关法规草案提请中央人民政府政务院审核。
