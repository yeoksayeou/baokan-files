　　Polish Six-Year Plan
    By Yaluofuyi, translated by Liang Shilong

    Poland's Three-Year Plan for economic recovery was completed ahead of schedule in two years and ten months by the end of 1949. The following statistics show how the economic strength of the Polish Republic has grown: the total value of industrial production in 1949 increased by 75 percent compared with pre-war levels, and the production volume per worker was about two and a half times that of pre-war levels. Great achievements have also been made in agriculture—agricultural products per capita exceeded pre-war levels by 12 percent, and the proportion of industry in the national economy increased to 68 percent, compared with only 45.5 percent in the pre-war year of 1937. A characteristic of the development of New Poland's industry is the continuous growth of the socialist sector, which accounted for 96 percent of all industry at the end of last year.

    These figures are very important as they demonstrate the clear superiority of socialist economic planning over capitalist anarchy. Now, for the first time, the hardworking Polish people can fully unleash their creative abilities. And they have directly produced many capable industrial managers from the workbench, mine, or construction site, who have been appointed as managers.

    The industry inherited by the People's Democratic Poland was backward and severely damaged by the war. However, within a few years of the Polish people seizing power, through their creative labor, they not only restored the destroyed factories but also expanded and modernized them. Poland has acquired industries it never had before—such as automobile, tractor, and shipbuilding industries. Much improvement has also been made to the old industries; in the machine manufacturing industry, it has begun to manufacture complex machine tools and other factory and mining equipment that Poland did not produce before. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the living standards of the working people have also improved.

    This year is the first year of Poland's Six-Year Plan for economic construction. This plan aims to lay the socialist foundation of the People's Democratic Republic of Poland.

    What does three plus six equal? This question is not as naive as it seems; the Polish magazine that published this question is not for first-grade elementary school students. The answer given by the working people of People's Democratic Poland is:

    ３＋６＝ｄｏｂｒｏｂｙｔ，

    Ｄｏｂｒｏｂｙｔ means prosperity, happiness, affluence. It also represents the kind of life that the Polish people are building through the Six-Year Plan for economic construction and development, which they are starting after successfully completing the Three-Year Plan.

    The start of the Six-Year Plan coincides with the fifth anniversary of Warsaw's liberation from the fascist invaders. At this time, I had a conversation with Engineer Piotrowski, the Minister of Construction. When he talked about how the Polish capital was restored from the ruins, he emphasized that by the end of the Six-Year Plan, the number of workers in Warsaw would reach 200,000.

    This number is noteworthy. Under the Three-Year Plan, the number of industrial workers in Warsaw more than doubled, reaching 130,000; the further expansion of the workforce indicates the continuous development of Warsaw's industry. Warsaw will have new factories, including factories manufacturing passenger cars, tools, machine tools, precision instruments, radios, electrical appliances, and medical equipment. There are also plans to establish a new giant printing factory called "The House of Polish Books," which will print not only books but also newspapers and magazines. In addition, there will be factories for clothing, textiles, musical instruments, and more. These will all be modern factories with the latest machinery. Old factories will not be neglected; there are plans for thorough renovation and massive expansion. The non-metal casting factory, boiler factory, candy factory, and the Oses tractor factory are also to be rebuilt. The Oses tractor factory was built after the war, but its production can no longer meet Poland's growing demand.

    Therefore, Warsaw will become an important industrial center. The development of the Polish capital reflects the reform process of the Polish national economy. The Six-Year Plan will eliminate the country's backwardness and make it one of the most advanced countries. Six years later, the industrial production volume per worker in Poland will be five times that of pre-war levels.

    ３＋６＝ｄｏｂｒｏｂｙｔ—this is the formula for a higher living standard for the Polish working people. To quote President Beirut's New Year's address, the standard after the completion of the Six-Year Plan will be doubled compared to pre-war levels.

    In the Szasnowiec coal mining area, I talked with a group of coal miners in the Cultural Palace. They were the best workers, each exceeding the prescribed output many times over. We discussed the coal miners' work, skills, daily life, and interests. The miners recalled their conversation with the British trade union delegation. "Why are you so enthusiastic about your work?" "Why do you produce several times more than your prescribed output?" one of the British visitors asked.

    The Polish miners replied, "Because now the mines are our own, and we work for ourselves, not for capitalists. The profits from our mines are not used to build villas and palaces for capitalists. We will build houses, cultural palaces, sanatoriums for ourselves, and schools, kindergartens, and nurseries for our children."

    These words are a very true description of the amazing production enthusiasm in every corner of Poland. The first month of the Six-Year Plan has seen many examples of the people's great creative efforts.

    A conference of leading production workers was held in Krakow to discuss methods for promoting socialist competition. In hardware and machinery factories, the number of workers adopting the high-speed work methods invented by Soviet lathe workers is increasing daily.

    In January, technical libraries were opened for workers in various industrial centers. Their main function is to provide the working masses with technical knowledge, to familiarize them with the achievements of Soviet scientists and Stakhanovite movement workers, and to help advanced workers implement rationalization proposals.

    In Lodz, the center of Poland's textile industry, production reformers and shock workers are cooperating with professors from local technical schools. They are talking about how to enable scientists and workers to cooperate to achieve common goals.

    These are all details of the same picture. Coal miners are meeting in towns and villages in the Silesian mining area to discuss methods and means to further improve labor productivity. Ordinary miners, technicians, and engineers are exchanging all their experiences in order to make the most rational application of existing capabilities and equipment. The meeting helped to discover many previously untapped potentials for improving productivity. Soon, the results became apparent: coal production exceeded the January plan by 2.6 percent.

    The production competition continues to accelerate and expand. A miner named Markevka at the Polska coal mine swore, "Although 73.5 meters is prescribed, I will complete 220.5 meters of tunnel within three months, as a contribution to socialist construction and the prosperity and higher cultural level of the Polish people. During the same period, my assistant and I will produce 1,620 tons of coal instead of our quota of 540 tons."

    Markevka, a Silesian miner, has made some new contributions to the socialist competition in Poland. Previously, workers only swore to do something in the short term; however, now they are following Markevka's example and are also proposing long-term goals. The movement was initiated by the Polska coal mine, first promoted to other coal mines and factories in Silesia, and now it has spread to all parts of the country. Warsaw construction workers, following Markevka's patriotic call, began their movement to complete two and a half years' worth of plans in this year (1950).

    It's the same all over the country, from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains, from Biegon to the Oder and Neisse rivers. In factories, mines, state-owned farms, and cooperative farms, the Polish people are building the edifice of socialism, brick by brick.

    The famous bricklayer and creator of high-speed bricklaying methods, Kolazhevsky, is now a director in the Ministry of Construction. When I visited him at the Ministry of Construction, he pointed to a pile of books on his desk and said, "These are all books written by Soviet scientists, engineers, and worker inventors. Their experience helps us rebuild Warsaw and build factories, houses, schools, clubs, and theaters."

    It has been two years since Poland and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement and Poland received industrial equipment loaned by the Soviet Union under the five-year agreement, by the end of January this year. Almost simultaneously, the barter agreement for 1950 was also signed in Moscow; Soviet-Polish trade is projected to increase by 34 percent compared to 1949.

    "Soviet goods and Soviet technological assistance are a great guarantee for us to complete the Six-Year Plan," a Polish engineer told me. "The Soviet Union supplies us with industrial equipment. I can say that the Polish people consider this very natural because our people say: 'Light comes from the East, and help comes from Stalin in Moscow.'"

    The Polish people have embarked on a broad road to happiness, to socialism; there is no doubt that they will successfully complete this road.

　　波兰六年计划
    雅洛伏衣著  梁世隆译
    波兰恢复经济的三年计划在一九四九年底以二年零十个月提前完成了。从下面的统计可以看出波兰共和国的经济力量怎样增长的：一九四九年工业生产量总值比战前增加了百分之七十五，每个工人的生产量约为战前的二倍半。农业上获得的成就也很大——农业产品按人口每人计算是超过战前水准百分之十二，工业在国民经济的比重增至百分之六十八，而战前一九三七年仅为百分之四五·五。新波兰工业发展的特点是社会主义的部分不断增长，去年年末它已占全部工业的百分之九十六。
    这些数字是很重要的，它们说明了社会主义经济计划显然优于资本主义的无政府状态。现在勤劳的波兰人民，第一次能够充分发挥他们的创造能力。并且他们已直接从工作台、矿坑、或建筑工作产生出不少能干的工业管理人材，被委派为经理。
    人民民主波兰所承继的工业，是落后的而且是曾受战争严重毁坏的工业。但波兰人民掌握政权以后不到几年，以他们富有创造性的劳动，不仅做到了恢复被破坏的工厂，而且将其扩充和现代化。波兰已获得它前所未有的工业——例如汽车、拖拉机和造船业等。对旧的工业也做了不少改进；在机器制造业方面已开始制造波兰以前不出产的复杂工作母机及其他多项的工厂及开矿设备。随着工业及农业的迅速发展，劳动人民福利水准也提高了。
    今年是波兰经济建设的六年计划的第一年。这个计划准备将奠下波兰人民民主共和国社会主义的基础。
    三加六等于多少？这个问题并不像看来那样幼稚；登载这个问题的波兰杂志并不是给一年级小学生看的。人民民主波兰劳动人民所做的答案是：
    ３＋６＝ｄｏｂｒｏｂｙｔ，
    Ｄｏｂｒｏｂｙｔ意即繁荣、幸福、富足。它也代表着波兰人民在胜利的完成三年计划以后，接着开始从事经济建设与发展的六年计划所建造的那种的生活。
    六年计划的开始刚好是华沙从法西斯侵略者手中解放的五周年纪念。恰于此时，我与建设部长皮欧特罗维斯基工程师谈了一次话。当他谈到波兰首都如何从废墟中恢复起来时，他强调六年计划的末了一年华沙工人数目将达到二十万人。
    这个数字是值得注意的。在三年计划下，华沙工业工人的数目增加一倍多，已达到十三万人；工人队伍更进一步的扩张是表明华沙工业不断的发展。华沙城将要有新的工厂，其中将有制造客车、工具、工作母机、精密仪器、无线电、电气用具和医药设备的工厂。还计划设立新的巨大印刷工厂，称为“波兰书籍之家”，它除了印刷书籍之外，还印刷报纸和杂志。另外还要有衣服、织物、乐器等工厂。这些都是将具有最新式机器设备的现代工厂。旧式工厂也将不被忽略，计划准备加以彻底翻新和大量扩充。非金属铸造厂、汽锅厂、糖果厂和欧塞斯拖拉机厂，也准备重建。欧塞斯拖拉机工厂是战后建立的，但它的生产已不能满足波兰的日益增长的需求了。
    因此华沙将成为一个重要的工业中心。波兰首都的发展反映着波兰国民经济的改革进程。六年计划将消除国家的落后性并使它成为最先进国家之一。六年以后，波兰每个工人的工业生产量将为战前的五倍。
    ３＋６＝ｄｏｂｒｏｂｙｔ——这是波兰劳动人民更高的生活水准的公式。引用总统贝鲁特新年文告的话，六年计划完成后的标准将比战前提高一倍。
    在沙斯诺维克煤矿区，我在文化宫与一伙煤矿工人谈话。他们是最好的工人，每个人都超过规定产量许多倍。我们讨论了煤矿工人的工作、技巧、每天生活以及利益等等。矿工们回忆到与英国工会代表团的谈话。“为什么你们那样热心你们的工作？”“为什么你们生产数倍于规定你们的产量？”英国访问者中的一位问道。
    波兰矿工回答道：“因为现在矿是我们自己的，我们为自己而不是为资本家工作。我们的矿的利润不是为了给资本家建筑别墅和宫殿。我们将为我们自己建筑房屋、文化宫、疗养所，并且为我们子女们建筑学校、幼稚园和托儿所。”
    这些话对于波兰每一角落的惊人生产热情是一个很真实的说明。六年计划的最初一个月就有许多表现人民伟大创造努力之事迹。
    在克拉柯召开了带头的生产工人会议讨论推进社会主义竞赛的方法。五金和机械工厂中，工人采用苏联车床工人发明的高速工作方法的，人数日见增加。
    正月，各工业中心为工人开办技术图书馆。其主要作用是供给工人群众技术知识，使他们熟知苏维埃科学家和斯达哈诺夫运动者的成就，并帮助先进工人们实现合理化建议。
    在波兰纺织工业中心罗兹生产改革者和突击工人们与当地技术专门学校的教授们合作。他们所谈到的是怎样使科学家和工人合作以完成共同的目标。
    这些是同一幅图画的细节。煤矿工人在西里西亚矿区的城镇和乡村开会，讨论更进一步提高劳动生产力的方法与手段。普通矿工、技术人员及工程师交换他们所有的经验，以便将现有的能力和设备，作最合理的应用。会议有助于发现可以提高生产力的不少以前没有动用的潜力。不久，其结果就显露出来了：煤的生产量超过正月份计划百分之二·六。
    生产竞赛继续加速扩展。有一个矿工马克也夫加在波尔斯加煤矿宣誓说：“虽然规定的是七三·五米，我要在三个月之内完成二二○·五米的坑道，以此来贡献给社会主义的建设和波兰人民的繁荣和更高的文化水平。在相同期间内，我的助手和我将生产一、六二○吨煤而不是我们五四○吨的定额。”
    西里西亚矿工马克也夫加在波兰社会主义竞赛中有些新的贡献。以前工人仅仅宣誓在短期间做什么，然而，现在他们效法着马克也夫加，也提出了长期的目标。运动由波尔斯加煤矿发动，首先推广至西里西亚的其它煤矿和工厂，现在已扩及到全国各部分。华沙建筑工人随着马克也夫加的爱国的号召，开始其在今年一年（一九五○年）中完成两年半计划的运动。
    全国都是一样，从波罗的海到喀尔巴仟山脉，从贝哥到奥得河和尼斯。在工厂、煤矿、国营农场和合作农场，波兰人民都为社会主义的大厦砌上砖石，一块一块地砌上去。
    著名的砌砖匠和高速砌砖方法的创造者科拉日维斯基现在已是建筑部的一个司长，当我到建筑部拜访他时，他指着桌上的一堆书籍，说道：“这都是苏联科学家、工程师和工人发明家写的书籍。他们的经验帮助我们重建华沙，建立工厂、住宅、学校、俱乐部和戏院。”
    波兰与苏联订定贸易协定及波兰在五年协定下得到苏联贷给的工业设备，到今年一月底，已是两年了。差不多同时，一九五○年的易货协定也在莫斯科签定了；苏波贸易预定将比一九四九年增加百分之三十四。
    “苏联货物和苏联技术的帮助，对于我们，是完成六年计划之大保证”，波兰一个工程师对我讲，“苏联供给我们工业设备。我可以说，波兰人民认为这是很自然的，因为我国的人民说：‘光明来自东方，帮助来自在莫斯科的斯大林’。”
    波兰人民走上了通向到幸福、通向社会主义的一条大道；他们将成功地走完这条道路，是不容怀疑的。
