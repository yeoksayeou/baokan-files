The Ministry of Agriculture Coordinates National Cottonseed Supply
Notifies All Regions to Strive to Loan All Cottonseed to Farmers Before Qingming Festival

[Our newspaper's report] Following the National Agricultural Production Conference, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a circular on the 10th of this month, detailing the cottonseed coordination situation in various regions of the country. It also requested continued and rapid work to ensure that cottonseed is loaned to farmers before Qingming. To guarantee the completion of cotton planting tasks after the National Agricultural Production Conference, all regions are actively preparing for the coordination of improved varieties and general cottonseed, with particular attention paid to solving the cottonseed needs of flood-stricken areas such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Hubei, and Hebei. As of early February, the situation in various regions is as follows:

Northeast Region: Actively promotes the Guannong No. 1 cotton variety on a large scale, eliminating the Jinzi cotton variety. Last year, the region produced 37 million jin of cottonseed, which is sufficient for local use. In addition to each county coordinating on its own, Liaodong Province is transferring over 200,000 jin from Yingkou to Liaoyang, and Rehe Province is using the surplus cottonseed from Chaoyang and Beipiao to coordinate for Lingyuan, Qinglong, and other counties. Liaoxi Province is arranging planting areas based on the cottonseed production of each county. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plants 75,000 mu, all with Zhongmian cotton. Lushun-Dalian uses locally produced seeds to plant 75,000 mu. In addition, state-owned ginneries control 8 million jin (scattered in ginneries in key counties). Each jin is priced at 2,000 yuan (Northeast currency) and transferred to provincial banks, which are then loaned out through governments at all levels for final coordination. The goal is to distribute the seeds to farmers before the end of February. The region has no issues with cottonseed supply.

Northwest Region: Shaanxi Province is expanding cotton fields by 200,000 mu. The province suffered from floods last year, resulting in a lower germination rate, but in addition to planting within the province, there is still a surplus of cottonseed, and the varieties are relatively pure (Si Zi No. 4).

North China Region: Shanxi Province has overly mixed seeds. The Ministry of Agriculture purchased 390,000 jin of Si Zi No. 4 cottonseed, 1,600 jin of Jingsi cotton, and 5,000 jin of "517" cotton from Shaanxi before the New Year, and transported them to Linfen, Xinjiang, Yuncheng and other places to promote breeding to gradually replace local inferior varieties. Ordinary seeds are coordinated and resolved locally.

In Hebei Province, ginneries in various cotton-producing guidance areas have controlled 4.5 million jin of improved Si Zi No. 2B seeds through flower collection and purity preservation. Ginneries and the provincial government have obtained 4 million jin of Si Zi No. 4 cottonseed and ordinary seeds, which will be supplied to Tangshan, Tianjin, Tongxian and other flood-stricken areas. The Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office has transported 1 million jin controlled by ginneries and 300,000 jin of Si Zi No. 4 improved seeds purchased from Shimen to disaster areas and promotion areas. With the addition of self-coordination by local cooperatives and the masses, the province's cottonseed problem can be solved.

The Pingyuan Province Cotton Production Cooperative has purchased 1.6 million jin of cottonseed, and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation currently has 1.2 million jin in stock, which can be contacted for lending. The province has generally resolved its needs.

East China Region: Northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui and other flood-stricken areas are relatively lacking in cottonseed. 4 million jin (2,000 tons) of improved varieties have been ordered from abroad, with 1 million jin coordinated for Central China, and the remainder promoted in the region. On the other hand, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation expects to purchase 24 million jin of general cottonseed in various places this winter and spring for coordination within the region and with other regions.

Shandong Province: Within the cottonseeds purchased by the East China Region, 1 million jin (No. 2) are allocated to the Bohai area, and 500,000 jin (No. 5A) are allocated to the central and southern Shandong and Jiaodong areas. The province's trade departments expect to purchase 5 million jin of Si Zi No. 2B and No. 4 for coordination, with the remainder to be resolved locally. It is estimated that there will still be a surplus.

Zhejiang Province: Within the cottonseeds purchased by the East China Region, 140,000 jin of Dai Zi No. 15 are allocated and concentrated in Pinghu and Haiyan counties for breeding. General cottonseed is in surplus due to the good harvest last year, in addition to the province's own use.

Jiangsu Province: Within the cottonseeds purchased by the East China Region, 280,000 jin of Dai Zi No. 15 are allocated to southern Jiangsu, and 580,000 jin are allocated to northern Jiangsu. Southern Jiangsu can be self-sufficient in general cottonseed and has a surplus. In addition to the 5 million jin allocated from Shandong, the remaining cottonseed in northern Jiangsu will be resolved as much as possible by local authorities and farmers themselves.

Anhui Province: Plans to plant 1.2 million mu of cotton, but is relatively short of seeds. The southern Anhui trade department purchased 200,000 jin, and Zhejiang allocated 400,000 jin, with the remainder supplied by the Nanjing area. Northern Anhui purchased 1 million jin from Jiangpu, and Zhejiang allocated 100,000 jin of Dezi cotton, and southern Anhui allocated 10,000 jin of Kezi cotton, with the remainder to be resolved locally.

Central South Region: 1 million jin of Dai Zi and Ke Zi cottonseed purchased by East China are allocated, 500,000 jin of Dezi cotton are purchased from Zhejiang, and 200,000 jin of Kezi cotton are purchased from southern Jiangsu to solve the shortage of improved varieties. For the coordination of general cottonseed, the cotton fields in central Hubei suffered from disasters last year. Purchases from western and northeastern Hubei are used for supply, which can solve the needs of 5.5 million mu. If a part is allocated from the seeds supplied by East China to Central China, there will still be a surplus.

Henan Province purchased 1 million jin of "Ambassador" cotton and Si Zi No. 4 in Shangqiu, Chenggao, Luoyang, and Lingbao in Shanzhou, and mobilized the masses to automatically exchange seeds and retain seeds.

Jiangxi Province purchased 173,000 jin of Dai Zi cotton in Shanghai and Jiangpu, and 27,000 jin in Nanjing, for a total of 200,000 jin.

Hunan Province solves the cottonseed problem through local coordination.

Beijing Suburbs: Planting 50,000 mu of cotton. In addition to the seeds retained by the masses themselves, the Nanyuan Ginnery of the Ministry coordinates 200,000 jin of improved varieties to solve the needs of state-owned farms in the Beijing suburbs and Tianjin-Gu state-owned farms. 80,000 jin of pure No. 2B improved seeds are sold to them from the Tongxian Ginnery for planting 8,000 mu. The cottonseed problem in the Beijing suburbs has been largely resolved.

However, the following issues should continue to be noted and resolved in the current cottonseed coordination: A. Some regions have already taken possession of the cottonseed, while others are in the process of purchasing it. Many cottonseeds purchased from distant places have not yet been retrieved. The cotton planting season is only one month away. Therefore, rapid purchasing and transportation, striving to deliver the seeds to the masses before Qingming (20 days), is an extremely urgent task (the decision of the Northeast to deliver the seeds to the masses before the end of February is extremely appropriate). B. Investment in the purchase of cottonseed should be allocated quickly to avoid affecting the purchase. C. The solution to the cottonseed problem, in addition to the government's efforts in purchasing and coordination, mainly relies on organizing cooperatives and trade departments to rely on the strength of the masses to solve it themselves. For example, the Baoding Special Commissioner's Office Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province is preparing to purchase 500,000 jin of improved varieties to solve local difficulties. This is worth learning from in various places. D. In the large-scale coordination of seeds, special attention should be paid to preventing seed mixing and reduced germination rates. The method adopted by Hebei Province, which calls on organizing the masses to remove small seeds, broken seeds, and obvious inferior seeds, can also be adopted in various places.

　　农业部调剂全国棉籽
    通报各地争取在清明节前将棉籽全部贷到农民手里
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部于本月十日发出通报，详述全国各地区棉籽调剂情况，并要求继续迅速工作，争取棉籽于清明前贷到农民手里。全国农业生产会议后，为保证完成植棉任务，各地均积极准备良种及一般棉种之调剂，尤以苏北、皖北、湖北、河北等水灾区之棉籽解决更引为注意，截至二月上旬止，各地解决情况如下：
    东北区：大量推广关农一号棉，淘汰金字棉，去年产棉籽三七○○○万斤，本地够用，除各县自行调剂外，辽东省由营口调剂二十余万斤给辽阳、热河省以朝阳、北票剩余棉籽调剂给凌源、青龙等县。辽西省按各县产籽情况，布置播种面积。内蒙自治区植七万五千亩，都是中棉。旅大以当地所产种籽播种七万五千亩。另外公营轧花厂掌握八百万斤（散在各重点县轧花厂内）。每斤按二千元（东北币）作价移交各省银行，通过各级政府贷出，做最后调剂。争取在二月底以前发到农民手里，该区棉种已无问题。
    西北区：陕西省扩大棉田二十万亩。去年该省遭受水灾，发芽率降低，但棉籽除本省种植外，仍有多余，且品种也较纯（斯字四号）。
    华北区：山西省因种籽太杂。由中央农业部年前自陕西购斯字四号棉籽三九万斤，泾斯棉一千六百斤，“五一七”棉五千斤，分别运至临汾、新绛及运城等地推广繁殖，以逐渐代替本地劣种，普通种由当地自行调剂解决。
    河北省各棉产指导区，轧花厂经过收花、保纯，已控制斯字二Ｂ良种四百五十万斤，斯字四号棉种及普通种各轧花厂及省府已掌握到四百万斤，供给唐山、天津、通县等水灾专区。唐山专署已将轧花厂控制的一百万斤，及从石门购买之斯字四号良种三十万斤，分别运至灾区及推广区。加上各地合作社及群众自行调剂，该省棉种问题已可解决。
    平原省棉产社已购得棉籽一百六十万斤，花纱布公司现存一百二十万斤，可接洽贷放，本省大致已解决。
    华东区：以苏北、皖北等水灾区较缺乏，已自国外订购良种四百万斤（二千吨），调剂华中一百万斤，余在本区推广。另方面花纱布公司，去冬今春在各地预计收购一般棉籽二千四百万斤，作为调剂本区及外区之用。
    山东省：华东区购置棉籽内，拨渤海区一百万斤（二号），鲁中南区、胶东区各五十万斤（五Ａ），本省贸易部门预计收购斯字二Ｂ及四号五百万斤，作为调剂，余由地方自行解决，估计还可有剩余。
    浙江省：华东区购置棉籽内，拨岱字十五号十四万斤，集中平湖、海盐二县繁殖，一般棉籽，因去年收成较好，除本省自用尚有剩余。
    江苏省：华东区购置棉籽内，拨岱字十五号二十八万斤给苏南，五十八万斤给苏北。一般棉籽苏南可以自给且有余，苏北棉籽除由山东调拨五百万斤外，余由地方及农民尽可能自行解决。
    安徽省：计划植棉一百二十万亩，种籽较缺，皖南贸易部门收购二十万斤，浙江调拨四十万斤，余由南京区供给。皖北向江浦收购一百万斤，浙江调拨德字棉十万斤，皖南调拨珂字棉一万斤，余由地方自行解决。
    中南区：华东调拨购置之岱字、珂字棉籽一百万斤，向浙江购德字棉五十万斤，苏南购珂字棉二十万斤，以解决良种之缺乏。一般棉籽之调剂，湖北省鄂中去年棉田受灾，由鄂西、鄂东北收购供给，可解决五百五十万亩，如再由华东供给华中之种籽中分配一部，尚有剩余。
    河南省在商邱、成皋、洛阳、及陕州灵宝等地收购大使棉和斯字四号一百万斤，并发动群众自动换种留种。
    江西省在上海，江浦购岱字棉十七万三千斤，南京购二万七千斤，共二十万斤。
    湖南省棉种就地调配解决。
    京郊区：植棉五万亩，除群众自留种外，由本部南苑轧花厂调剂良种二十万斤解决京郊国营农场及津沽国营农场，植棉八千亩，从通县轧花厂以纯二Ｂ良种售予八万斤，京郊棉籽已大致解决。
    但在目前调剂棉籽中还应继续注意与解决以下问题：甲、各地区之棉籽有的已掌握到手，有的正在进行收购，由远地购置之棉籽，不少尚未取回，现届植棉期，仅有一个月。因此迅速收购、运输、争取清明前发到群众手里（二十天），这是一个极为紧迫的工作（东北争取二月底前发到群众手里之决定是极为合适的）。乙、收购棉籽之投资应迅速拨下，以免影响收购。丙、棉种问题的解决，除以政府力量的收购调剂外，更主要的是组织合作，贸易等部门依靠群众的力量自行解决。如河北省、保定专区供销社，即准备收购良种五十万斤，解决本地困难。值得各地学习。丁、在种籽大量调剂中，应特别注意防止种籽混杂及发芽率降低，河北省号召组织群众将小籽、破籽及明显的劣籽挑除的办法，各地亦可采用。
