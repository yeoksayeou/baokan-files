    *Two Heroes Defend the Nation*
    (Printed Chinese Subtitles)
    This film depicts the historical events of the Russian people's struggle against the Polish invaders in 1612. In 1610, the Polish army, colluding with Russian nobles, occupied Moscow and oppressed the Russian people. The Russian people rose up in resistance, and the serf Roman organized the citizens of Moscow to participate in the uprising of Duke Pozharsky's troops. The Polish army set fire to houses in Moscow, and the militia had to retreat. In 1612, Minin also raised a volunteer army with donations from various cities, selecting Pozharsky as the commander of the militia and Roman as the deputy commander, besieging Moscow, and finally completely crushing the Polish army and recovering Moscow.
