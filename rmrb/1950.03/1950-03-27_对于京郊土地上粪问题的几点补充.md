Several Supplements Regarding the Issue of Applying Manure to Land in the Suburbs of Beijing

To the Editor:

    After reading "What Kind of Fertilizer Should Be Applied to the Land in the Suburbs of Beijing," we feel that there are a few points that should be supplemented:

    I. Ways to Solve the Fertilizer Shortage:

    (1) Solving it Yourself: This is the most important and most economical way:

    (1) Manure Accumulation: Use garbage, ash soil, plant ash, pile it up to decompose, and then apply it to the land. It contains a lot of organic matter and is good for the soil.

    (2) Pressing Green Manure (Green Manuring): Popular in Mentougou and other places, this involves turning green grass and other non-crop plants into the soil during their growing season to serve as fertilizer.

    (3) Hauling Ditch Mud: The city is currently clearing sewers, and the cleared ditch mud is very fertile fertilizer that can be used during the agricultural slack season to haul from the city.

    (II) Purchasing Fertilizer:

    (1) Dried Human Manure: The suburbs of the city can produce about 800 tons annually. According to the current situation, the price is about seven and a half to eight catties of dried manure can be bought with one catty of corn.

    (2) Buying Fertilizer Powder: Currently, places in China that produce fertilizer powder include Pukou, Tianjin, Dalian, etc.

    (3) Buying Other Fertilizer Substitutes: Such as soybean cake from the Northeast, pig bristles from eastern Hebei, and cotton oil cake, etc., are also very good fertilizers.

    II. Regarding the Price of Manure: 30 catties of corn can buy 1,000 catties of manure, which refers to night soil including urine. According to the statistics of the Municipal Government Suburban Committee, more than 2 million catties of first-class manure have been purchased outside Guang'anmen this spring, each basket weighing 20 catties, equivalent to 3.4 catties of corn; second-class manure, each basket weighing 26 catties, equivalent to 2.14 catties of corn. One million catties have been purchased outside Fuchengmen, each basket weighing 13 catties, equivalent to 2 catties of corn; second-class manure, each basket weighing 13 catties, equivalent to 1.12 catties of corn.

### 对于京郊土地上粪问题的几点补充

　　对于京郊土地上粪问题的几点补充编辑同志：
    读了“京郊土地该上什么肥料”后，我们觉得还应有几点补充：
    一、解决肥料不足的办法：
    （一）自己解决这是最主要的办法，也是最经济的办法：
    （１）积肥：利用垃圾，灰土、草木灰、堆积腐烂，然后可上地，其中有含机质多，对土壤有好处。
    （２）压绿肥（压青），在门头沟等地方流行，即将青草等非作物在生长期中翻入土中可充肥料。
    （３）拉沟泥：目前城内正清理下水道，清出的沟泥，是很肥的肥料，可以利用农闲进城拉取。
    （二）购买肥料：
    （１）人粪干：城郊每年约可出产八百多吨的，价格依照目前情况，约每斤玉米可买到七斤半至八斤左右的粪干。
    （２）买肥田粉：现在中国产肥田粉的地方，有浦口、天津、大连等地。
    （３）买其他代肥品，如东北的大豆饼、冀东的猪毛，另外如棉油饼等亦为很好的肥料。
    二、关于粪肥的价格：三十斤玉米可买一千斤粪肥，当系指连尿在内的圊肥。市府郊委会统计今春广安门外，已买到二百余万斤、头等粪每筐二十斤，合玉米三斤四两、次等的每筐廿六斤，合玉米二斤十四两；阜成门外已买到一百万斤，每筐十三斤，合玉米二斤，次等的每筐十三斤，合玉米一斤十二两。
