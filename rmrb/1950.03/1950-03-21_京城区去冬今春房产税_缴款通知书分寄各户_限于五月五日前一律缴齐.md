[Beijing News Agency] Beijing Municipality's preparations for the combined collection of property tax for the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950 in the urban districts have been completed. The payment notices for approximately 86,400 households in the city's urban areas, including public (excluding buildings used by government agencies and the military), private, school, and state-owned enterprise properties, have been fully delivered by the Municipal Tax Bureau through the post office today (the 21st). Upon receiving the notice, all business owners must pay at the various People's Banks and their temporary entrusted locations before May 5th; overdue payments will be penalized according to regulations. The total amount of grain (rice) listed on the notice, representing the property tax for both seasons plus the 30% surcharge for sanitation and education expenses, will be converted into Renminbi based on the gold treasury rice price of the day; those holding tax grain coupons can use them at a rate of one jin for one jin. The taxpayer is the property owner; if the property ownership is unclear or the house is ownerless, the current user shall temporarily pay, and must not refuse under any pretext, so as to fulfill the people's tax obligations and ensure government revenue. The combined collection of property tax for two seasons in one notice is because the collection period for last winter's property tax has long passed, and this year's spring property tax is also due. For this reason, the Municipal Government issued Announcement No. 3 of the Municipal Finance Department as early as the 14th of this month, hoping that all taxpayers would make preparations as soon as possible, and requesting all property owners and managers with property transfers, changes in usage, and address changes to report to the tax sub-bureaus in their respective jurisdictions before the end of March; those who fail to report by the deadline will be assessed and levied according to the information listed in the original register. The property tax collection business was originally managed by the Municipal Finance Bureau, but due to the unified tax collection agency, the Municipal Government decided to transfer it completely to the Municipal Tax Bureau from the 14th, which has also been notified in the announcement; if taxpayers have any questions, they can contact the tax sub-bureaus in their respective districts. The temporary jurisdictions of the tax sub-bureaus for property tax collection are as follows:

　　The First Tax Sub-bureau is located at No. 41, Wangzhima Hutong, Third District, and has jurisdiction over all of the First and Third Districts. The Second Tax Sub-bureau is located at No. 21, Former Ministry of Justice Street, Second District, and has jurisdiction over all of the Second, Seventh, and Fourth Districts. The Third Tax Sub-bureau is located at No. 4, Muchang Hutong, Eighth District, and has jurisdiction over all of the Eighth and Tenth Districts. The Fourth Tax Sub-bureau is located at the Former Zhimeilou Restaurant on Meishi Street, Ninth District, and has jurisdiction over all of the Ninth, Twelfth, and Eleventh Districts. The Eighth Tax Sub-bureau is located at No. 6, Sanzuao Bridge, Fifth District, and has jurisdiction over all of the Fifth and Sixth Districts.
