　　Promoting the Normalization of Labor-Management Relations
    ——A Record of the National Labor Bureau Directors Conference
    The National Labor Bureau Directors Conference was conducted in the spirit of “seeking truth from facts.” Before the conference, the Ministry of Labor made full preparations, widely soliciting opinions and experiences on various agenda items of the conference, and initially drafted seven drafts including the "Provisional Organizational Rules for Provincial and Municipal Labor Bureaus," the "Provisional Trade Union Law," and the "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises." The conference adopted a consultative approach, especially consulting more often with representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors from major cities who attended the conference. Therefore, the above seven drafts passed by the conference were a combination of principles and experience, coming from the masses and prepared to go to the masses. This consultative approach provided a good method for labor bureaus in various regions to help labor and management resolve disputes, which is worth emulating.
    The conference gave each participant a further understanding of the basic principles of the New Democratic labor policy: "develop production, prosper the economy, consider both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and management." They especially recognized the positive role played by private capital in the process of New Democratic construction in today's special circumstances in China. In order to change the 10% and 90% ratio between industry and agriculture, it is necessary to maximize the initiative and entrepreneurial spirit of private capital and enable it to develop in industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods. In the future, for a considerable period of time, legitimate private industry and commerce will have great development prospects. Therefore, the representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors attending the conference had a clear confidence in the development of private industry and commerce. Mr. Chen Suiheng, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said it well: "As an enlightened and progressive national capitalist, it is necessary to not be passive or retreat. On the contrary, it is necessary to play an active construction role, concentrate all capital and wealth, invest in production and construction undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods, steadily combine private capital with state capital, move towards state capitalism, and peacefully enter socialist society."
    The conference educated every participating representative on how to learn to "value people." In the old society, the most important thing in capital was machinery, and people were merely appendages of machinery. The entire production system and organization were built on this unreasonable phenomenon. After liberation, the political and social status of workers has changed, but material living and working conditions have not changed significantly. Just taking coal mining as an example, last year in the eight state-owned coal mines in Northeast China, an average of 30,000 tons of coal were mined for every worker death; in North China, one worker died for every 20,000 tons; and in East China, three workers died for every 10,000 tons. This situation must change. Therefore, the tasks facing labor bureaus and trade unions in the future are how to take measures to protect workers, change working conditions, and change the unfavorable position of laborers in production. The task facing national capitalists is how to eradicate the old set of production management methods, learn to value the working people, and achieve genuine mutual benefit for labor and management.
    The conference focused on labor-management relations, and after a long period of repeated discussions and consultations, the gains were also the greatest. The representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors attending the conference universally recognized that the new labor-management relationship is an equal, democratic, mutually beneficial, and contractual relationship, no longer a relationship between oppressor and oppressed. The national bourgeoisie must adopt a new and honest attitude, a democratic and progressive style, to meet this new labor-management relationship, and must thoroughly realize that it is impossible and not allowed to treat workers with the old feudal control methods and oppress workers.
    According to the experience of various regions, in order to normalize labor-management relations, promoting the signing of collective contracts and using labor-management consultation meetings to conduct equal consultations are new organizational forms created by the masses. Therefore, the task of labor bureaus in the future is to normalize labor-management relations by adopting methods such as signing collective contracts, collective consultations, and promulgating unified laws and regulations. Trade unions should pay attention to educating workers to actively negotiate with employers on an equal and voluntary basis, and all issues should be based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Both labor and management should understand how to use this new form to solve problems and improve the current production status of private enterprises.
    The National Labor Bureau Directors Conference has successfully concluded, and the representatives have returned with fruitful results. In the future, what rests on their shoulders is how to change the working conditions in public and private enterprises, how to further promote the normalization of labor-management relations, how to improve and increase production, and most importantly, how to flexibly and correctly apply the fruits of the conference to various relevant specific issues. This still requires the continuous efforts of all workers, national capitalists, and labor bureau and trade union comrades.

　　推进劳资关系正常化
    ——记全国劳动局长会议
    全国劳动局长会议是本着“实事求是”的精神进行的。会前，劳动部曾做了充分的准备工作，广泛吸取了有关这次会议各项议题的意见和经验，并初步拟出《省、市劳动局暂时组织通则》、《工会暂行法》、《关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示》等七项草案。会议采用协商方式，特别和列席这次会议的各主要城市的工商界代表协商的次数较多，因此会议通过的上述七项草案都是原则和经验的结合，是从群众中来，准备到群众中去的。这种协商的方式，给各地劳动局帮助劳资双方解决争议，提供了一套值得仿效的好办法。
    会议给予每一与会者对于新民主主义劳动政策“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的基本原则以进一步的了解，他们特别认识到在今天中国特殊的情况下，私营资本在新民主主义建设过程中所起的积极作用。为了改变工业与农业上百分之十与百分之九十的比例，必须尽量发挥私营资本的积极性和企业心，使之在有利于国计民生的工商业方面发展。今后在相当长时期中，正当的私营工商业有着大大的发展前途，因此列席会议的工商界代表对于发展私营工商业有了明确的信心。南京市工商联合会副主任委员陈邃衡先生说得好：“作为一个开明的、进步的民族资本家，必须要不消极，不退缩，相反的，要发生积极的建设作用，要集中一切资本财富，投向有利国计民生的生产建设事业，稳步的把私人资本与国家资本结合起来，走向国家资本主义，和平的进入社会主义社会。”
    会议教育了每一个与会代表要懂得怎样学会“重视人”。在旧社会，资本中最重要的是机器，人只是机器的附属品，整个生产制度和组织都建筑在这一不合理的现象上。解放以后，工人政治和社会地位已经改变，但是物质生活和劳动条件并没有大的更改，仅就采煤来说，去年东北八个国营煤矿，平均挖煤三万吨，死工人一名，华北每两万吨，死工人一名，华东每一万吨，死工人三名，这种情况必须改变。因此，今后摆在劳动局和工会方面的，是怎样采取保护工人的措施，改变劳动条件，改变劳动者在生产上所处的不利地位。摆在民族资本家面前的，是怎样根除旧的一套管理生产的办法，学会重视劳动人民，以达到真正的劳资两利。
    会议的重点放在劳资关系问题上，经过长时间的反复讨论协商，收获也最大。列席会议的工商界代表普遍地认识到：新的劳资关系是平等的、民主的、两利的、契约的关系，不再是压迫者与被压迫者的关系了。民族资产阶级必须要以新的、老老实实的态度，民主的进步的作风，去迎接这新的劳资关系，必须彻底认识到不可能也不允许再以过去旧的封建的统制办法来对待工人，压迫工人。
    根据各地的经验，要使劳资关系正常化，在推广订立集体合同，在运用劳资协商会议进行平等的协商，这是群众创造的新的组织形式。因此，今后劳动局的任务是采取订集体合同、集体协商颁布统一的法令等办法来使劳资关系正常化。工会要注意的是教育工人主动地和资方平等自愿的协商，一切问题要建筑在平等两利的原则上，而劳资双方都要懂得运用这一新形式来解决问题，来改进目前私营企业的生产状态。
    全国劳动局长会议已胜利地结束，代表们满载而归，今后搁在他们肩上的，是怎样改变公私营企业中的劳动条件，怎样进一步促使劳资关系正常化，怎样改进和提高生产，而最重要的在怎样使会议产生的果实，灵活的正确的运用到各个有关具体问题中去，还有待全体工人、民族资本家以及劳动局和工会工作同志不断的努力。
