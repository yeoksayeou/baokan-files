Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th. US imperialism is conspiring to carry out sabotage and will allocate huge sums to strengthen international espionage activities. According to the United States Information Service, US Secretary of State Acheson testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee on February 28th that of the $230 million allocated to the State Department for fiscal year 1951, $36 million will be used for "international intelligence and educational activities." Acheson revealed that this sum is intended to counter the sentiment among people of various countries against America's policy of aggression.

Because America's aggressive policies have already drawn condemnation from peace-loving and democratic people around the world, Acheson said, "We must take on the obligation of spreading our ideas and beliefs not only behind the Iron Curtain, but also among our friends and allies." Acheson believes that his $36 million is well worth it, calling it "one of the most effective uses of funds in diplomatic relations." This "intelligence and educational activity" is "an important arm of American foreign policy." Acheson's words confirm what Washington diplomatic sources quoted by the Associated Press on February 17th said: "The United States will intensify efforts to alienate the Soviet Union from Communist China, as well as the Soviet Union from other Asian peoples who seem to sympathize with the Kremlin." It is obvious that the US State Department will use this $36 million to conduct espionage activities and other rumors and slanders around the world, especially in Asia.

　　美帝阴谋进行破坏勾当
    将拨巨款加强间谍活动
    【新华社北京四日电】美国国务院将以巨款加强国际间谍活动。据美国新闻处消息，美国国务卿艾奇逊在二月廿八日向参院拨款委员会作证时说：在一九五一年度国务院经费二亿三千万美元中，将以三千六百万美元作为“国际情报与教育活动”的费用。艾奇逊透露，这笔款项是用来对付各国人民反对美国侵略政策的情绪的。
    由于美国的侵略政策已经引起了全世界爱好和平民主人民的斥责，艾奇逊说：“我们自己得负起非仅在铁幕之后，而且在我们的朋友与同盟国间散布我们的思想与信仰的义务”。艾奇逊认为他这三千六百万美元是很值得的，它是“用于外交关系中最能产生效果的款项之一”。这种“情报与教育活动”，是“美国外交政策的一只重要的臂膀”。艾奇逊的话证实了合众社二月十七日所引华盛顿外交人士所说的话，这些人士曾说：“美国将加紧努力离间苏联与中共以及苏联与似乎颇为同情克里姆林宫的其他亚洲人民”。显而易见，美国国务院将用这三千六百万美元在全世界，特别是在亚洲，进行间谍活动及其他造谣、诬蔑等勾当。
