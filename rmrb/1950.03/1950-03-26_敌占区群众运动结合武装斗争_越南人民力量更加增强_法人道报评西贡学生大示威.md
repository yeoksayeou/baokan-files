　　Mass Movement in Enemy-Occupied Areas Combined with Armed Struggle
    Vietnamese People's Power Further Enhanced
    L'Humanité Comments on Large-Scale Student Demonstration in Saigon
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 25th] The Paris newspaper *L'Humanité* published an article on the 21st by Pierre Courtade entitled "The Lessons of Saigon," commenting on the large-scale anti-American, anti-French student demonstrations in Saigon. It stated that the mass student demonstrations in Saigon against the reinforcement of French colonialists by the American fleet are of great significance. This is a sign of the union between intellectuals and workers. The People's Liberation Army's shelling of American ships demonstrates the strength of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army and powerfully exposes the lie that Bảo Đại is able to "rule" the vast majority of areas, proving that French imperialists and their puppets are completely isolated. The author said: American imperialists should gradually understand that their so-called "opposition to colonialism" while simultaneously supporting colonialists by employing puppets can no longer deceive anyone. …
    The author pointed out: "In response to Acheson's speech, Foreign Minister Zhou of the People's Republic of China said: The Chinese people have learned from personal experience what American so-called 'aid' is. It is the loss of national freedom and rights." The author continued: The Asian people have fully understood that they will not make any choices between imperialism, colonialism, and puppets. After pointing out that the Vietnamese people are using the struggle for full independence to oppose the so-called "overall diplomacy" of the US State Department, the author especially emphasized: They have applied the principles proposed by Liu Shaoqi, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference with exemplary courage, combining mass movements in enemy-occupied areas with armed struggle. The author concluded: "The Saigon demonstrations and military actions implement a combination of two forms of struggle. This proves that the struggle will be further enhanced, and if the dirty war continues, then the interveners will have no choice but to surrender or jump into the sea."

　　敌占区群众运动结合武装斗争
    越南人民力量更加增强
    法人道报评西贡学生大示威
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】巴黎《人道报》于二十一日刊载比埃古尔塔以“西贡的教训”为题一文，评论西贡学生反美、反法大示威称：西贡学生反对美国舰队增援法国殖民主义者的群众示威运动具有重大的意义。这是知识分子和工人结合的表示。越南人民解放军炮袭美舰，说明越南人民解放军力量的强大，并有力地揭穿了保大能够“统治”绝大部分地区的谎言，证明法帝国主义者及其傀儡是完全孤立的。作者说：美国帝国主义者应该渐渐明白，他们所谓“反对殖民主义”而同时又支持殖民主义者雇用傀儡一套手腕，已不能欺骗任何人。……
    作者指出：“在回答艾奇逊谈话中，中华人民共和国周外长说：中国人已经从亲身的经验中懂得了美国的所谓“援助”是什么东西。这就是民族自由和权利的丧失”。作者继称：亚洲人民已经完全明白，他们决不要在帝国主义、殖民主义和傀儡们之间，进行什么选择。在指出越南人民以争取全面独立的斗争反对美国务院的所谓“总体外交”之后，作者特别强调称：他们以模范的勇敢运用了世界工联副主席刘少奇在亚澳工会会议上所提出的原则，把敌占区的群众运动和武装斗争结合起来。作者最后说：“西贡的示威和军事行动，实行了二种斗争形式的结合。这证明斗争将更加增强，而且如果肮脏战争还要继续下去的话，那末干涉者除了投降和跳海之外，别无他途可择。”
