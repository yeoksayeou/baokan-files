　　Several Problems in the Yantongshan Record-Breaking Movement

　　The new record-breaking movement in Yantongshan, which started in February with opposing waste, promoting thrift, and making rationalization proposals, has now been widely launched in all tunnels and sites throughout the mountain, and has achieved initial results. In order to better carry out this movement, I would like to raise a few issues I have seen for discussion with everyone:

　　(1) Record-breaking should not be a temporary rush; it should not focus solely on increasing the labor intensity of workers. This has not been sufficiently emphasized in Yantongshan. For example, the administrative and trade union departments of the field issued several wall newspapers, all praising workers' attitudes, such as not taking leave for work-related injuries and workers voluntarily working overtime (Editor's note: The workers' enthusiasm for labor is commendable and should be praised. However, factory and mine leaders should pay close attention to protecting workers' health and should not simply increase production by increasing labor intensity.), but the technical improvements in the twentieth tunnel, such as improving drilling techniques and reducing the use of medicine, were not promptly praised and promoted. They were reluctant to study, improve, and refine techniques and operating methods with everyone. For example, the 150-horsepower winch in the Nanshan inclined shaft of the field lost 180 tons of coal due to a malfunction; in the western second district, four tunnels, according to statistics from March 2nd to 8th for seven days, had 424 shots that failed to fire, which is equivalent to wasting 92 workdays, causing workers to hammer more than 60,000 times in vain. If these are improved, what a great role it will play in production!

　　(2) Now that the workers' enthusiasm for production has been aroused, cadres must also catch up, go deep into the tunnel sites, and provide concrete leadership and promotion. Most comrades in Yantongshan are doing this, but there are still a few people standing by as "judges," not showing much enthusiasm. At the same time, in general, there is not enough emphasis on going deep into the tunnels with focus, providing concrete leadership to help everyone formulate plans, etc. If attention is not paid to this promptly, it will definitely affect the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers.

　　(3) In the course of carrying out the record-breaking movement, some relatively backward workers are saying sarcastic and ironic things to advanced producers. Moreover, there is mutual exclusion and resentment among tunnels and workers in order to compete for model status. If this is not resolved properly, it will easily lead to disunity among workers and hinder production.

　　(4) In the record-breaking movement, cost accounting should be further strengthened, and attention should be paid to improving quality. Some individual workers in Yantongshan, in order to pursue quantity, are even treating stones as ore without detailed selection, and some cadres ideologically have the idea that "no matter what, as long as the task can be completed!" These are all incorrect and should be corrected. (Original text from Chahar Daily, March 16th. The editor's note is added by the newspaper editor.)

　　烟筒山创纪录中的几个问题
    烟筒山的创造新纪录运动，从二月份的反对浪费、开展节约及合理化建议开始，现已在全山各坑道、现场普遍展开，并取得初步成效。为将这一运动开展得更好，仅将个人见到的几个问题，提出和大家商量：
    （一）创纪录不是一时突击、不能单从提高工人劳动强度上去着眼，这在烟筒山还注意的不大够。比如：该场行政、工会，出了几次壁报，都是表扬公伤不休假、工友自动义务加工等属于工人劳动态度方面的（编者按：工人这种劳动热情是可贵的，应加以表扬。但厂矿领导者则应十分注意保护工人的健康，不应单纯地以提高劳动强度来增加生产。），而对二十坑的改进打眼技术、减少用药等技术上的改进，却未及时表扬、推广，懒于在技术上、操作方法上去和大家研究、提高、改进。比如该场南山斜井一百五十马力绞车，发生一次故障就少出一百八十吨煤；西部二区四个坑道，从三月二日至八日七天统计，就有四百二十四个炮没响，等于浪费九十二个工，使工人白打了六万多锤。这些要设法改进了，将会对生产起多大作用！
    （二）工人生产情绪起来了，干部也必须迎头赶上，深入坑道现场，具体领导、推动。烟筒山大多数同志都这样作了，但也有少数人还在旁边当“评判员”，表现不大积极。同时，一般说来，有重点的深入坑道，具体领导帮助大家订计划等，也还作得不够，如不及早注意，定会影响广大工人群众的生产热情。
    （三）在开展创纪录运动中，有些较比落后工人向先进生产者说些风凉、讽刺话。且各坑道及工人之间，为了争模范而互相排斥、怨恨。这要不很好注意解决，很易造成工人之间的不团结，而使生产受妨碍。
    （四）在创纪录运动中，应进一步加强对成本的核算，注意提高质量。烟筒山个别工人，为了追求数量，竟不经详细选择，而将石头也当成矿砂，有的干部思想上也存在了“不管怎么着，只要能完成任务就行！”这都是不正确的。应予改正。（原文见三月十六日察哈尔日报。作者长海。按语是本报编者的加。）
