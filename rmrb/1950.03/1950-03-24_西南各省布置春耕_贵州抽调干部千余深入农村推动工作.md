Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 21st: The southwestern provinces are now actively arranging spring ploughing production. After receiving instructions from the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee regarding this year's spring ploughing and agricultural production, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, based on the specific situation of the province's perennial grain shortage and the destruction caused by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, proposed that this year's spring ploughing must focus on both disaster preparedness and production recovery. It called on farmers to plant more early-maturing crops, cultivate wasteland, increase the planting of miscellaneous grains, and resolutely implement the order strictly prohibiting the planting of opium. The Provincial People's Government has also transferred over 1,400 cadres from provincial-level agencies to go deep into the rural areas to promote spring ploughing. In addition to arranging general spring ploughing production, the Southern Sichuan Administrative Office has issued low-interest, in-kind loans with a monthly interest rate of eight li to develop the region's sugar industry and cotton planting, resolving the production difficulties of sugarcane and cotton farmers. The Eastern Sichuan Administrative Office convened an agricultural production meeting in late February, deciding to widely publicize the People's Government's agricultural production policies to eliminate farmers' concerns about production, and to issue large amounts of agricultural loans to solve farmers' production difficulties. In addition, the meeting stipulated that all rural cadres should squeeze out a certain amount of time to help farmers with labor production without compensation.

　　西南各省布置春耕
    贵州抽调干部千余深入农村推动工作
    【新华社重庆二十一日电】西南各省现正积极布置春耕生产。贵州省人民政府接到西南军政委员会关于今年进行春耕和农业生产的指示后，即按照该省历年缺粮和遭受蒋匪劫掠破坏的具体情况，提出今年的春耕必须从备荒和恢复生产两重点出发，号召农民多播种早熟作物，开垦荒地，增种杂粮，坚决贯彻严禁种植鸦片的命令。该省人民政府又从省级各机关中抽调一千四百余干部深入农村，推动春耕工作。川南行政公署除布置一般的春耕生产外，为发展该区糖业和植棉，曾发放月息八厘的低利折实贷款，解决蔗农、棉农的生产困难。川东行政公署于二月下旬曾召开农业生产会议，决定广泛展开宣传人民政府的农业生产政策，以消除农民的生产顾虑；并发放大批农贷以解决农民生产上的困难。此外，会上还规定所有农村干部应挤出一定时间，无代价地帮助农民劳动生产。
