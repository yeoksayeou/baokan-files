Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th -- Most of Tianjin's public factories have drafted their production plans for this year. The steps for formulating these plans generally involve the engineering departments first drafting a plan based on past and current production conditions, machine efficiency, and material consumption. Then, the factory management committee, including administrative and production management personnel, union members, workshop representatives, and heads of various production departments, along with skilled technicians, studies the draft. Alternatively, they mobilize all employees for widespread discussion and modification, and finally submit it to higher authorities for approval. Therefore, the general plans are relatively practical and reasonable, truly becoming indicators for workers' actions.

The general characteristics of each factory's production plan are that the expected output is higher than last year. For example, the Tianjin Steel Plant's plan stipulates that this year's output will be 3.3 times that of last year, and the monosodium glutamate output of the Industrial Bureau's Chemical Plant will increase by approximately two times compared to last year. This is due to the increased production enthusiasm and skills of workers, the abundance of raw materials, smooth sales channels, and the fact that production in each factory had recovered and laid a foundation for development last year. At the same time, each factory emphasized in its plans the gradual implementation of various quota systems amid the continuous improvement of production, to achieve enterprise-based management. Secondly, most factory plans can meet the requirements of national economic construction, thereby reducing blindness in production. For example, the production plans of Tianjin Steel Plant and Tianjin Paper Mill of North China Paper Company were formulated based on the established policies and tasks of the National Steel Conference and Paper Conference, respectively.

However, the finalization time of each factory's plan, except for the Steel Plant and the China Textile system factories which finished before the Lunar New Year, was generally in January or February. Some factories, such as those under the North China Machinery Company, were unable to formulate plans in a timely manner because the higher-level leading organization had not determined a production policy. Some factories did not pay attention to accumulating production statistics in the past, and could not accurately calculate the estimated output and the use of labor and materials. For example, the Industrial Bureau's Knitting Factory and Rubber Factory submitted reports to higher authorities for review and modification multiple times, which delayed the process. These situations have greatly affected the timely completion of production tasks in January and February of this year.

During the implementation of the production plans, some factories have thoroughly conveyed the production plans to workers and staff, mobilizing them to engage in practical discussions to clarify the overall tasks and specific requirements, thereby further stimulating their production enthusiasm and creativity. For example, China Textile No. 2 Factory issued discussion outlines on eliminating substandard cloth to various workshops in the cloth production area, mobilizing workers to come up with solutions, which resulted in the rate of first-class cloth increasing to the prescribed standard. At the same time, many factories have launched mass production emulation campaigns based on specific conditions to ensure the completion of the plans. For example, the production and conservation campaign launched by the factories under the Industrial Bureau, the red flag campaign of China Textile No. 3 Factory, and the glorious team campaign of No. 4 Factory have all achieved great results. In addition, some factories have broken through technological conservatism, accepted advanced Soviet production technology and experience, providing a strong guarantee for the completion of the plans. Due to the adoption of suggestions from Soviet engineer for hot repair of open-hearth furnaces and improved operating methods and labor organization, the average output of steel ingots, wire rods, and wire ropes at the Tianjin Steel Plant exceeded the original plan by more than 62% in January.

　　天津大部分公营工厂拟定今年生产计划
    强调逐步实现各种定额制度，作到经营企业化
    【新华社天津二十七日电】天津市大部分公营工厂已拟定出今年的生产计划。这次制订计划的步骤一般地是先由工务部门根据过去与目前的生产状况、机器效能、材料消耗等实际情况，订出计划草案，再经工厂管理委员会吸收行政生产管理人员、工会委员、车间代表与各生产部门的负责人和熟练技工等进行研究，或发动全体职工普遍讨论和修改，最后呈请上级机关批准。因此，一般计划都较切实、合理，真正成为工人行动的指标。各厂生产计划的一般特点是预计产量均较去年为高。如天津制钢厂计划中规定今年产量为去年的三·三倍，工业局化学厂的味之素产量较去年产量约提高两倍。这是由于工人生产热情与技术的提高，原料充裕和销路畅通，与各厂生产在去年均已恢复并打下发展基础的原故。同时，各厂在计划中，一致强调在生产的不断提高中逐步实行各种定额制度，作到经营企业化。其次，各厂计划多能符合全国经济建设的要求，因之可减少生产上的盲目性。如天津制钢厂和华北造纸公司天津纸厂的生产计划，就是分别根据全国钢铁会议和纸张会议的既定方针和任务拟定的。
    但各厂计划最后拟定的时间，除制钢厂及中纺系在年前外，一般多在一月或二月；另有些工厂如华北机器公司所属各厂，因上级领导机构未确定出生产方针，所以未能及时订出计划。有的工厂因已往不注意积存生产统计资料，对预计产量与用工用料，不能确切计算，如工业局所属针织厂、橡胶厂，经往返多次呈报上级审核与修改，致使时间拖延。这种情形，都使今年一二月份生产任务的按期完成受到很大影响。
    在生产计划的执行中，有些工厂曾将生产计划向工人职员深入传达，发动他们切实讨论，使其明确总的任务和本身的具体要求，从而进一步发挥其生产积极性与创造性。如中纺二厂曾向布场各车间印发消灭次布的讨论提纲，发动工人提办法，结果使正布率提高到规定标准，同时，许多工厂很据具体条件，开展群众性的生产竞赛运动，以保证计划的完成。如工业局所属各厂开展的生产节约运动，中纺三厂的争红旗运动，四厂的争取光荣组运动，都已收到很大效果。此外，有些厂打破技术上的保守思想，接受苏联先进生产技术经验，使完成计划得到了有力的保证。天津制钢厂由于采用了苏联工程师热修马丁炉和改进操作方法与劳动组织等建议，使一月份钢锭、盘条、钢丝绳的产量平均超过原计划百分之六十二强。
