　　In parts of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces
    Red spider mites are harming wheat seedlings.
    All localities should organize the masses to vigorously eliminate them.
    [This newspaper reports] The Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has recently received numerous reports of insect infestations from various localities. The details are as follows: In late February, red spider mites were found in wheat fields around Jinxian County, Hebei Province, but the extent and area of the infestation are unknown. In late February, in the Yutai County area of the Pingyuan Lake West Special District, wheat fields along the lake were damaged by lake water and waves, as well as by lake ducks and cutworms, destroying more than 70 hectares. The area affected by cutworms is still expanding. In early March, in Shen Village of the Ninth District and Xihe Village of the Eighth District of Lin County in the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province, grasshoppers appeared successively on sunny barren hillsides, with about 70 to 80 insects per one to two square feet in severely affected areas. Thanks to prior preparation by the leadership, they were captured and killed immediately upon discovery. At the same time, 700 mu of rapeseed in the Fifth District of Xiuwu County in the same province were infested with flea beetles, with 30 to 40 insects on each leaf in severe cases. Grasshoppers, about two fen in length and blackish-brown in color (believed to be soil locusts because soil locusts are more cold-resistant and some can overwinter), were found on the roadside grass in the Fourth District of Huixian County. In addition, a type of worm, about one finger in length and as thick as a thin incense stick, grayish-brown in color with a blackish-brown head and long black spots on both sides of the body segments, was found in more than 20 mu of wheat fields in the Third District of Xinxiang, damaging the top heart and leaves of the wheat seedlings.
    Spring Equinox is approaching, and insect pests are emerging one after another. Based on the insect disasters of last autumn and the lack of snow this winter, it is likely that insect disasters will still occur widely this year. Production leadership departments at all levels must be highly vigilant and make all necessary preparations for insect pest control in advance. They should organize technical cadres to go to the areas affected by insect disasters last year to conduct detailed inspections, so as to prevent and control them whenever and wherever they occur.

    [This newspaper reports] Insect pests have occurred in five counties including Ningjin in the Xingtai Special District of Hebei Province, and the leading authorities in these counties and special districts immediately organized the masses to capture and kill them. On March 1st, flea beetles (known as black maggots by the masses) were found in rapeseed fields in ten villages including Fenghuang, Saiyang, and Xincheng in Neiqiu County, covering an area of more than 2,000 mu. On the 7th, the same insects were also found in six villages in Ningjin County, covering an area of 3,840 mu. Insect pests have also occurred successively in individual villages in Xingtai and Shahe counties, affecting approximately 1,000 mu of land. After discovering the pests, Fenghuang Village in Neiqiu County organized 190 people to capture and kill them the next day, and they have now been completely eliminated. The Ningjin County People's Government organized twelve cadres to rush to the areas where the pests had occurred to lead the masses in controlling them. After hearing the news, the Xingtai Special District Office issued an urgent notice on the 10th, urging all counties to pay serious attention to the occurrence of pests and not to be negligent. It also ordered all localities to conduct widespread inspections, and if pests are found, they should immediately organize the masses to thoroughly eliminate them. Areas that suffered from insect disasters last year should pay special attention to preventing the occurrence of insect pests. Currently, cadres and masses in various parts of the special district are capturing and killing insect pests and conducting strict inspections to prevent them.

　　河北平原两省部分地区
    发生红蜘蛛为害麦苗
    各地应组织群众大力扑灭
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部病虫害防治局，最近屡获各地发生虫害的报告，其详情如下：二月下旬河北晋县城周围麦田中已发生红蜘蛛，为害程度及面积不详。二月下旬平原湖西专区鱼台县沿湖一带麦田，被湖水风浪吹打与湖鸭、土蚕为害，已毁七十余顷。土蚕为害面积还在扩大。三月初，平原安阳专区之林县九区申村及八区西河村等地向阳的荒坡草地，先后发生跳蝻，严重处一二平方尺内约有七十至八十个。由于领导上事先有准备，发现后即行捕灭。与此同时，该省修武县五区油菜，有七百亩发生猿叶虫，严重者一棵叶上有三四十个。辉县四区大道旁的草地上发现蝗蝻，长约二分，黑褐色（据推测可能是土蝗，因为土蝗较耐寒，有的可以越冬）。此外新乡三区有麦田二十余亩发生一种肉虫，长约一指，粗如细香，体灰褐色，头黑褐色，体节两侧有长形黑斑，为害麦苗的顶心部及叶部。
    目前即到春分，虫害已陆续发生，根据去年秋季虫灾和冬季雪少情况来看，今年虫灾仍有可能普遍发生。各级生产领导部门，必须高度警惕，事前作好一切虫害防除的准备工作，有计划地组织技术干部到去年的虫灾区去，进行详细检查，以便随时发生随时防除。

    【本报讯】河北省邢台专区宁晋等五县发生虫害，各该县与专署领导方面立即组织群众捕打。三月一日，内邱县凤凰、塞阳、新城等十村油菜地发现猿叶虫（群众叫黑蛆），面积有二千余亩。七日宁晋县六个村亦发现此虫，面积有三千八百四十亩。邢台、沙河两县个别村庄约千余亩地亦相继发生虫害。内邱县凤凰村于发现害虫后，第二天即组织群众一百九十人进行捕打，现已完全消灭。宁晋县人民政府组织了十二个干部急赴发生害虫的地区领导群众进行除治。邢台专署闻讯后，于十日发出急紧通报，督促各县对害虫的发生引起严重注意，切勿麻痹大意，并令各地普遍进行检查，如有害虫发现，应即组织群众力量彻底扑灭。去年曾受虫灾的地区，应特别注意防止害虫的发生。现该专区各地干部与群众，正在进行捕打害虫和严格检查防止。
