　　From the Representative Conferences of All Circles in Northern Bin Areas:
    Inspect the Closed-Door Tendencies Within the Party
    Xin Wei
    Editor's Note: Comrade Xin Wei's review of the closed-door tendencies within the Party based on the situation of the representative conferences of all circles in various counties and districts of the northern Bin area is good. However, it does not mention how to correct this in the future, which is insufficient. On March 25th, the CPC Central Committee instructed the entire Party to strengthen the unity and cooperation between Communist Party members and democratic figures, as well as the broad masses of non-Party people. It also published the document "Stalin and Mao Zedong on How Communist Party Members Should Be Good at Uniting and Cooperating with Non-Party People," requiring Party committees at all levels and all Party members to study it carefully and conduct self-criticism based on it. The Northern Bin District Committee is expected to continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism based on the Central Committee's instructions, formulate specific corrective measures, and earnestly implement them. It would be best if the correction situation could be sent to us for publication. At the same time, Party committees and Party member comrades in various regions are expected to promptly report on exemplary cases of unity and cooperation between Party members and non-Party people, and to criticize the undesirable tendency of closed-doorism that separates them from the masses, as well as their experiences and self-criticism in studying the Central Committee's instructions.
    Since the Jiaocheng Representative Conference of All Circles in Shandong Province's Jiaodong Administrative Region's Northern Bin Area on September 26th of last year, all counties have successively completed their Party and non-Party representative conferences by mid-January of this year. The vast majority of districts have also held Party and non-Party meetings. The experience of various counties and districts proves that the Party and non-Party representative conferences have played a great role in changing work styles, promoting democracy, mobilizing all strata to implement policies, and jointly overcoming difficulties. At the same time, the Party and the government have communicated with the people from all walks of life, and have begun to break the long-term isolation of the Party from non-Party people in the Northern Bin area, thereby greatly educating and improving cadres. Many cadres reflected: "We must be democratic from now on! All work must be done well by consulting with the masses..." However, there are still many serious shortcomings in these meetings, the most basic of which is that the closed-doorism ideology within the Party is still extremely serious. Therefore, we believe that overcoming the closed-doorism ideology within the Party has become the basic key to carrying out the democratic movement.
    From the representative conferences of all circles in various places, the closed-doorism within the Party is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    1. The representatives participating in the meeting are not broad enough. The Party and government leaders in various places excessively and inappropriately emphasized political seriousness, resulting in Party member activists accounting for the absolute majority of the representatives. For example, Party members accounted for more than 65 percent of the representatives in Wulian County; the vast number of representative figures from all strata were not well united. There is also a thought of excluding middle peasants. In the Farmer Representative Conference of the Chengxi District of Jiaoxian County, representatives with middle peasant composition accounted for less than 20 percent.
    2. There is a more serious closed-door attitude towards non-Party people. At the Jiaonan Representative Conference, some people criticized the government, and many cadres immediately refuted them. One representative proposed: "The government does not allow sweeping salt soil (along the coast), and the lives of salt farmers should be solved!" A deputy district chief immediately rebuked: "Sweeping salt soil is a violation of government decrees!" (This phenomenon was quickly corrected). Among the representatives in Zhucheng, a middle peasant who had been wrongly struggled against (a military family member who had protected public property) said at the conference: "We people must produce well!" Some representatives under the stage stopped him from speaking and retorted: "Who is with you people!" Some counties are unnatural in approaching specially invited representatives, and even unwilling to approach them.
    3. The leadership lacks a magnanimous and highly conscious democratic style of striving for criticism and supervision from representatives. Cadres in some counties only want to speak themselves, and are unwilling to listen to non-Party people; they are willing to be praised and flattered, but fail to vigorously support the well-intentioned criticisms of non-Party people, and even are unhappy when others criticize them. Some counties use the attitude of past cadre meetings to "educate" and even reprimand representatives, and their democratic style is very poor.
    The roots of this narrow closed-doorism ideology and style are as follows:
    1. The enlarged cadre meeting of the Jiaodong District Party Committee in September of last year decided that the Party and non-Party democratic movement is a major issue for mobilizing and organizing vast forces to ensure the completion of various tasks in the future. The District Committee did not understand and grasp the spirit and essence of this policy sufficiently, so it failed to fully convey, deploy, and implement the instructions of the District Party Committee, resulting in the failure of the leadership's ideology and work to solve the problem of connecting with the masses.
    2. The remnants of "leftist" erroneous thinking and narrow class views among Party member cadres have not been vigorously criticized and thoroughly transformed.
    3. The District Committee has not studied documents such as "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" enough, and has not deeply understood the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of our Party. It has not yet clearly established the idea of cooperating with non-Party people to build a new country, and therefore has failed to change its work style and overcome narrow closed-doorism in a timely manner.

### 从滨北各县区各界代表会  检查党内关门主义偏向

　　从滨北各县区各界代表会
    检查党内关门主义偏向
    辛玮
    编者按：辛玮同志根据滨北地区各县区各界代表会的情况，检讨了党内的关门主义偏向，并初步分析了这一偏向的思想根源，这是好的。但对今后如何纠正，则没有谈到，这是不够的。三月二十五日中共中央指示全党加强共产党员和民主人士及广大的非党群众的团结合作。并发表了“斯大林毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作”的文件，要求各级党委会和全体党员认真地加以学习，并据以进行检讨。希望滨北地委根据中央指示，继续深入检讨，作出具体的纠正办法，认真贯彻执行，最好能将改正情况寄给我们发表。同时希望各地党委会和党员同志，及时报道党员与非党群众团结合作的模范事例和批评关门主义脱离群众的不良倾向，以及学习党中央指示的心得和检讨。
    山东省胶东行政区滨北地区，自去年九月二十六日胶城各界代表会议后，截至今年一月中旬，各县相继开完党内外代表会议。绝大多数的区，也开了党内外会议。各县区的经验证明：党内外代表会议，对于转变作风，发扬民主，发动各阶层贯彻执行政策，共同克服困难的作用极大。同时党、政府与各界人民群众通了气，开始打破了滨北地区党长期与党外人士隔绝的关门情况，从而大大的教育与提高了干部。很多干部反映：“今后一定要民主了！一切工作一定要和群众好好商量才会作好……”但这些会议中也还存在着许多严重缺点，其中最基本的则是：党内关门主义思想仍极为严重。因之，我们认为克服党内关门主义思想，已成为开展民主运动的基本关键。
    从各地各界代表会看出，党内的关门主义主要表现在以下几方面：
    一、参加会议的代表不够广泛。各地党、政领导上过分地不适当地强调政治上的严肃性，致使代表中党员积极分子占绝对多数。如五莲县代表中党员占百分之六十五以上；没有很好地把各阶层广大的代表人物团结进来。对中农也有排斥思想，胶县城西区农民代表会中，中农成份的代表不到百分之二十。
    二、对待党外人士的态度上，存在着较为严重的关门主义态度。胶南代表会上，有人对政府提出批评，不少干部立即反驳。有一代表提出：“政府不让扫盐土（沿海），盐民生活应当设法解决！”，一个副区长立时训斥说：“扫盐土是违犯政府法令！”（这一现象很快地得到纠正）。诸城代表中有一位被错斗的中农（军属，曾保护过公家物资）在大会上讲话时说：“咱们这些人要好好生产！”台下有些代表竟制止他发言，驳斥道：“谁和你一伙人呀！”有些县对特聘的代表接近不自然，甚至不愿接近。
    三、领导上缺乏虚怀若谷、高度自觉地争取代表批评监督的民主风度。有的县的干部只愿自己讲，不愿听党外人士讲；愿意别人歌功颂德夸奖奉承，未能有力地支持党外人士的善意批评，甚至不高兴别人批评。有的县以过去开干部会的态度，“教育”甚至训斥代表，民主作风很差。
    这种党内的狭隘关门主义的思想作风的根源有以下几点：
    一、去年九月胶东区党委扩大干部会议中曾决定：党内外民主运动是动员与组织广大力量，保证完成今后各种工作任务的重大问题。地委对这一方针的精神和实质领会掌握不够，因而未能完整地传达、布置与贯彻区党委指示，结果使领导思想与工作均未能解决与群众连系问题。
    二、党员干部中的“左”倾错误思想残余，和狭隘的阶级观点尚未得到有力的批判和彻底转变。
    三、地委对“论人民民主专政”等文件学习不够，对我党二中全会精神体会不深，尚未明确树立与党外人士合作建设新国家的思想，因之未能及时地转变作风，克服狭隘的关门主义思想。
