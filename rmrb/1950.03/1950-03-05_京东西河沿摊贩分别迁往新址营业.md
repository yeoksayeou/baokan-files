    Beijing News: Over two thousand stallholders along the East and West Riverbanks in this city have recently been relocated to new sites for business. To facilitate the dredging of the Qian San Men moat this month by the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, and to accommodate the stallholders' business operations, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, based on the stallholders' opinions, has designated new sites for them. The five trades from the original East Riverbank, including cigarettes, matches, tobacco shreds, dried fruits, and miscellaneous food stalls, have been moved to the Dongdan Market; the four trades of red and white sugar, candy, toys, and fried goods have been moved to the Xianongtan Market; the general merchandise market has been moved to the West Main Street of Chongwai Flower Market; and the meat and vegetable market has been moved to the Qiannei Shuncheng Street Market. The four trades from the original West Houheyan Market, including used clothing, drums, food, and miscellaneous goods, have all been moved to the Xuannei Shuncheng Street Market.

　　京东西河沿摊贩分别迁往新址营业
    【北京讯】本市东、西河沿沿岸摊贩二千余户，于日内分别迁往各新址营业。由于市卫生工程局本月疏浚前三门护城河工程为便利工程进行，并照顾他们的营业，市府商业局根据摊贩的意见，特辟定新址供其营业。原东河沿之纸烟、火柴、烟丝、干果以及杂货饭摊五行业已迁往东单市场；红白糖、糖果、耍货、油炸货等四行业迁往先农坛市场；百货市迁往崇外花市西大街；肉菜市迁往前内顺城街市场。原西后河沿市场估衣、打鼓、食品及杂货等四个行业均迁往宣内顺城街市场。
