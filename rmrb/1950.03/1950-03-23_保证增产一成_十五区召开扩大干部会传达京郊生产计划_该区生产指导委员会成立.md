　　Guarantee a Ten Percent Increase in Production
    Fifteenth District Holds Expanded Cadre Meeting to Convey Beijing Suburban Production Plan
    District Production Guidance Committee Established
    [Report from this newspaper] The Fifteenth District of Beijing suburbs held an expanded cadre meeting on the 20th to convey the Beijing suburban agricultural production plan and called on everyone to strive to complete the task of increasing production by 10% this year. A total of 345 cadres from district and village governments, farmers' associations, public security bureau police stations, cooperatives, banks, and other units attended the meeting. Hao Weichun, the district head, announced the establishment of the District Production Guidance Committee and its tasks at the meeting, and explained that villages should also quickly establish such committees to guide village production work and ensure the completion of the production plan. The Village Production Guidance Committee will designate the village head, director of the farmers' association, secretary of the CCP branch, security officer, and production committee member as ex-officio members, and will also absorb experienced old farmers to form a strong leadership structure. He pointed out that the favorable conditions for increasing production this year are: 1. After the struggles of opposing the Baojia system, anti-corruption, fighting drought, sowing, and land reform, the masses have greatly improved their consciousness and their enthusiasm for production has also increased. 2. After the anti-espionage and security work, social order has been basically stabilized. 3. The cancellation of wartime service tasks has reduced the burden on farmers. 4. Strong government support, such as the construction of water conservancy projects and loans. Finally, he called on all cadres to take the lead in production, mobilize the masses to organize mutual aid teams, and at the same time, villages should organize supply and marketing cooperatives and supply and marketing groups according to their needs, emphasizing that cooperatives should serve production and organize the masses to vigorously develop sideline production.
