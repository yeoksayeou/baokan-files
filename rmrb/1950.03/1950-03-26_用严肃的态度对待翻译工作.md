　　Treat Translation Work with a Serious Attitude
　　On March 11th, this newspaper published an article entitled "Introducing 'Sagen's Spring'" in the "People's Garden" section. Later, we discovered that this translation contained many errors. We are now publishing three articles criticizing the errors in the translation of this Soviet novel. Translating and introducing Soviet literary works is one of the major tasks in current literary work, and also an important task in the education of the Chinese people. The broad masses of readers urgently demand to read excellent Soviet literary works, and their fervent love for these works is growing daily. Publishers and translators should meet this need of the broad masses of readers with a highly responsible and serious attitude. However, some publishers, such as the Shanghai Times Bookstore, are publishing crudely made, appalling translations to harm readers. This phenomenon is not good and must be corrected.

　　用严肃的态度对待翻译工作
    本报三月十一日在《人民园地》曾刊载“介绍《萨根的春天》”一文，后来我们发现这个译本是有很多错误的。现在我们特发表三篇指摘苏联小说译文错误的文章。翻译介绍苏联文艺作品，是当前文艺工作上重大任务之一，也是教育中国人民事业上的重要工作之一。广大读者迫切要求阅读苏联优秀文艺作品，而且热烈爱好这些作品，这种要求与爱好正在日益增长。出版家和翻译工作者应当以十分负责、严肃的态度来满足广大读者的这种需要。现在有些出版商，如上海时代书局，却出版一些粗制滥造、恶劣不堪的译本来贻害读者。这种现象是不好的，必须加以纠正。
