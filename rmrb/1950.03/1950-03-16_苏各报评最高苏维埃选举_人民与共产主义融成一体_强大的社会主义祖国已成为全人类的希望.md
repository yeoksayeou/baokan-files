　　[Xinhua News Agency, 15th] A comprehensive TASS dispatch: On the 14th, Soviet newspapers published the Central Election Committee's communique on the results of the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections on the front page, and commented on this glorious victory. A True Light Daily editorial stated: The Soviet people's unanimous vote for the candidates of the Stalin Party and the non-Party alliance is another indication of unanimous approval of the Bolsheviks' wise policy. This election is a victory for Soviet democracy. Now there are no hostile classes in our country, and all kinds of social and national oppression have long been eliminated. Two great forces—the people and communism—are integrated into a single whole. Only in a country like ours can there be such a manifestation of the entire people's political activism. This election once again shows the world the inseparable bond between the Communist Party and the broad masses of the people, and the great loyalty of our people to the cause of communism.
    A News Bulletin editorial stated: The Third Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has been elected with the active, conscious, and well-organized participation of the Soviet people. The working people of the Soviet Union fully trust the Party of Lenin and Stalin with renewed strength. Our strong and invincible motherland is the hope of all mankind. The strength of the peace camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is enough to stop war. The banner of peace also inspires the working people of capitalist countries to oppose aggression, oppose new wars, and defend the socialist motherland of the working people of all countries—the Soviet Union.
  Many voters wrote enthusiastic inscriptions on their ballots or wrote directly to Stalin to wish him long life and health
    The newspapers published many letters from voters and enthusiastic inscriptions written by voters on their ballots. A citizen of Sakhalin (i.e., Kuye Island) said: "I am fortunate to have personally voted for Comrade Stalin in Moscow. The residents of our Sakhalin, like the people of the whole country, often feel Stalin's care." An old mother with nine sons wrapped a letter to Stalin in her ballot, writing: "Five of my sons died in the patriotic war, but I am not alone. I am voting for you for the happiness of my grandchildren and great-grandchildren, for the happiness of all mankind, and to make the enemy tremble. I wish you long life and health!" A helmsman from Leningrad wrote in a letter: "I have been to the United States more than once, and I know who is respected there. I have an American magazine that describes a millionaire arranging a grand banquet to entertain her dog, with disgusting pictures of the fat woman and her dog with a bejeweled collar. I have seen the astonishing gray faces of the unemployed in the United States more than once, in New York and Philadelphia, women and children digging through trash cans in search of food." These are just sparks of Soviet patriotism, but they reflect the hearts of millions of Soviet people, just as a drop of water reflects the sun.

　　苏各报评最高苏维埃选举
    人民与共产主义融成一体
    强大的社会主义祖国已成为全人类的希望
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社讯：十四日苏联各报以首页地位刊载中央选举委员会发表关于苏联最高苏维埃选举结果的公报，并评论这一辉煌胜利。真理报社论称：苏维埃人民一致投票选举斯大林党与非党联盟的候选人，是又一次表示一致赞成布尔什维克的英明政策。这次选举是苏维埃民主的胜利。现在我们国内没有敌对阶级，早已消灭了各种社会压迫和民族压迫，两支伟大的力量——人民与共产主义交融成单一的整体。只有在我们这样的国家里，才可能有这种全体人民的政治积极性的表现。这次选举又一次向全世界表明共产党和广大人民之牢不可分，和我国人民对共产主义事业的伟大忠诚。
    消息报社论称：苏联第三届最高苏维埃已经在苏维埃人民积极、自觉和良好的组织下选举出来了，苏联劳动人民以新的力量充分信赖列宁、斯大林的党。我们强大无敌的祖国便是全人类的希望。以苏联为首的和平阵营力量，足以制止战争。和平的旗帜也鼓舞着资本主义国家的劳动人民来反对侵略，反对新战争，保卫各国劳动人民的社会主义祖国——苏联。
  许多选民将热情的题词写在选票上或直接写信给斯大林祝长寿健康
    报上刊出许多选民的信与选民在选票上的热情的题词。一位萨哈连（即库页岛）的公民说：“我幸运地在莫斯科亲投斯大林同志的票，我们萨哈连的居民和全国人民一样地经常感到斯大林的关怀。”一位九个儿子的老母亲，用选票包了一封给斯大林的信，她写道：“我的五个儿子在爱国战争中死亡了，但我并不孤独。我投票选举您，是为了我的孙儿与曾孙的幸福，为了全体人类的幸福，并为了使敌人发抖。我祝您长寿健康！”列宁格勒的一个舵手写信说：“我不止一次地到过美国，我知道在那儿谁受尊重。我手边有一本美国杂志，它描写百万富人安排盛大宴会招待她的狗，登着令人作呕的照片——胖妇人和她带着宝石颈圈的狗。我曾不止一次地在美国看见失业者的令人吃惊的灰白面孔，在纽约，也在费拉得尔菲亚，妇人和儿童挖掘垃圾箱，寻找食物。”这些不过表现了苏联爱国主义的星星点点，却反映出千万苏联人民的心，就如同一滴水反映出了太阳。
