Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th. The Southwest District Financial and Economic Committee, in order to implement the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," held a Southwest Financial Meeting from March 12th to 20th. Participating in the meeting were leading cadres and financial responsible cadres from the four administrative regions of Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan, the two provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, Chongqing Municipality, and directly subordinate units of the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee. The cadres attending the meeting unanimously supported the State Council's policy of unifying national financial and economic work and discussed and passed specific measures for implementing the State Council's decisions. Regarding the rectification of revenue: The meeting passed two major decisions on ensuring the completion of tax revenue tasks and public grain tasks, as well as specific plans for grain warehousing, storage, and allocation. Regarding economizing expenditures: In accordance with the compilation guidelines stipulated by the Central Government, the meeting cautiously verified the number of personnel and re-drafted the establishment plans for governments and armies at all levels in the Southwest District. This establishment plan has been greatly simplified compared to the originally estimated number of personnel. To ensure the realization of this establishment plan, in addition to the establishment of a Compilation Committee under the Southwest Military and Political Committee, governments and armies at all levels will also establish Compilation Committee branches, with all reorganization to be completed before the end of April. Regarding the clearing of materials: In addition to establishing a branch of the Southwest District Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee, it was also decided that governments and armies at all levels will organize branches of the Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee, under the leadership of the Southwest District Warehouse Material Clearing Committee branch, to carry out clearing work in a focused and step-by-step manner. The meeting decided to first clear important and valuable materials, then clear secondary materials; first clear open-air materials, then clear warehouse materials; and achieve both clearing and tidying. All existing materials in various departments, whether received, surplus, or produced, should be checked clearly according to unified names, and registers should be made and reported level by level; strict prevention of any false reporting or one-sided emphasis on the needs of one's own unit is required. After the clearing, all materials will be frozen, and the warehouses will still be the responsibility of the original units for safekeeping, and will be allocated uniformly by the Central Government.
    The financial meeting fully agreed with the decision that all financial revenues should be managed by the treasury and the Southwest District material supply plan stipulated by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. The meeting decided that after this meeting, the Financial and Economic Committee will separately convene specialized meetings on trade, industry, finance, agriculture, and other areas to solve various related problems. All cadres attending the meeting unanimously believed that the Southwest District was liberated relatively late, and Kuomintang secret agents and bandits are still trying to sabotage our construction work. It is natural that there are difficulties in carrying out this task, but under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, coupled with the advantageous conditions of the large population and abundant resources of the Southwest, as long as the entire party, government, army, and people unanimously recognize the current financial difficulties of the country and resolutely implement the decisions of the State Council, we can overcome all difficulties and complete the task of balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices.

　　西南区召开财政会议
    对整顿收入、节约支出、清理资材等工作作了具体决定
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】西南区财政经济委员会为执行中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，于三月十二日至二十日召开了西南财政会议。参加会议的有川东、川西、川南、川北四个行政区，云南、贵州两省，重庆直辖市及西南财经委员会直属各单位的领导干部和财政负责干部。到会干部一致拥护政务院统一国家财经工作的方针，讨论和通过了执行政务院决定的各项具体措施。在整顿收入方面：会议通过了关于保证完成税收任务和公粮任务的两大决定以及粮食入仓、保管和调拨的具体方案。在节约支出方面：会议按照中央所规定的编制方针，审慎核实人数，重新拟定了西南区各级政府和军队的编制计划，这个编制计划较原先所估计的员额已大为精简。为保证此项编制计划的实现，除已在西南军政委员会之下成立编制委员会而外，各级政府和军队也将分别成立编制委员会，限四月底以前全部整编完毕。在清理资材方面：除成立西南区仓库物资清理调配委员会分会外，并决定各级政府和军队也将分别组织仓库物资清理调配委员会支会，在西南区仓库物资清理委员会分会领导下有重点有步骤地进行清理工作。会议决定：先清理重要的珍贵的物资，后清理次要的物资；先清理露天的物资，后清理仓库的物资；做到一面清理，一面整理。凡各部门现存物资，不论是接收的，结余的或生产的，均应按统一名称，查点清楚，造具表册，逐级上报；严格防止任何虚报或片面强调本单位需要等倾向。在清理后所有物资即告冻结，仓库则仍由原单位负责保管，由中央统一调配。
    财政会议完全同意一切财政收入统由金库管理的决定和中央人民政府贸易部所规定的西南区物资供应计划。会议决定在此次会议后将由财经委员会分别召集全区贸易、工业、金融、农业等各种专门会议，以解决各项有关问题。全体到会干部一致认为：西南区解放较迟，国民党特务和土匪还在想法破坏我们的建设工作，执行这一任务自然是有困难的，但我们在中央人民政府的正确领导之下，加上西南人口众多、物产丰富的有利条件，只要党政军民全体一致认识目前国家财经困难，坚决执行政务院决定，就可以克服一切困难，完成平衡收支和平稳物价的任务。
