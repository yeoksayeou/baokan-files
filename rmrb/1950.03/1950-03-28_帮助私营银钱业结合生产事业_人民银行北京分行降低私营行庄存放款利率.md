　　[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, in view of the recent stabilization of prices, and in order to enable private banking and finance to develop their business properly and better integrate with production enterprises, has lowered the deposit and loan interest rates for private banks and financial firms starting today (28th).

　　Since late February, prices in the city have been stable, and a large amount of floating capital in the market has been deposited in private banks for interest. As a result, the deposits of private banks have increased significantly, but the loans have not increased proportionally. For example, the total deposits of private banks in the city were over 21.3 billion yuan on February 16th, and increased to over 37.7 billion yuan by March 18th, while loans on March 18th accounted for only 53% of deposits. Since March, an average of about 14 billion yuan per day could not be lent out. Private banks were absorbing deposits at high interest rates, resulting in significant losses. In response to the market situation, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China convened two forums with private bank leaders to discuss the issue of lowering interest rates. Everyone believed that under the current stable price situation, the interest rates of private banks were too high, exceeding the profits of legitimate industry and commerce, which was detrimental to the development of production. If the excessively high interest rates were not reduced, it would inevitably lead to losses for some industrial and commercial enterprises, and would also be a heavy burden on the banks themselves. The meeting unanimously agreed to lower the deposit and loan interest rates. After being submitted by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China to the Head Office for approval and filed with the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, the interest rates have been lowered from today, tentatively set as follows: the maximum loan interest rate shall not exceed 1.8% per month (originally 3.75%), the maximum monthly interest rate for fixed deposits of one month shall be 1.2% (originally 2.25%), the maximum monthly interest rate for fixed deposits of half a month shall be 0.9%, the monthly interest rate for type A current deposits shall be 0.3%, and the monthly interest rate for type B current deposits shall be 0.4%.

    人民银行北京分行降低私营行庄存放款利率
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民银行北京分行鉴于近来物价日趋平稳，为使私营银钱业正当发展业务，并与生产事业更好的结合，自今（二十八）日起降低私营行庄存放款利率。
    本市自二月下旬以来，物价一直平稳，市场游资多投向私营行庄生息，私营行庄因此存款增加甚多，而放款却未比例增加；如全市的私营行庄存款总数二月十六日是二百十三亿余元，到三月十八日增到三百七十七亿余元，而三月十八日放款仅为存款的百分之五十三。自三月以来平均每天约有一百四十亿元放不出去，私营行庄以高利吸收存款，结果亏累甚多。中国人民银行北京分行针对市场情况，先后两次召集私营行庄负责人座谈，讨论降低利率问题。大家认为在目前物价稳定情况下，私营行庄利率过高，超过正当工商业的利润，这对发展生产是不利的，如果过高的利率不予降低，势将促使部分工商业赔累，同时对行庄本身也是沉重负担。会上一致同意降低存放款利率。后经中国人民银行北京分行呈经总行核准并报市财经委员会备案，自今日起降低利率，暂定为：放款利率最高不得超过月息十八分（原三十七分半），存款定期一月最高月息十二分（原二十二分半），定期半月最高月息九分，甲种活期存款月息三分，乙种活期存款月息四分。
