Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th: The New Era magazine recently published an article by Markov entitled "The 'New Policy' of the United States in the Far East," exposing the US policy towards Far Eastern countries. Markov wrote: The US State Department's formal recognition of the bankruptcy of its China policy is equivalent to losing more than six billion US dollars invested in interventionist gambling. The United States has irretrievably lost the vast Chinese market and colonial rule over a country with abundant natural and human resources.

In order to consolidate its position in the Philippines, Indochina, South Korea, Burma and Thailand, the United States spent more than 2.5 billion yuan in these countries between 1945 and 1949 through subsidies, credit loans, loans and property transfers, but it failed to achieve its goals. Inspired by the victory of the great Chinese people, the nations of Asia are intensifying their resistance to the imperialists. The scene in Asia is no longer a few isolated anti-imperialist struggle centers here and there; Asia has become an unconquerable front of people of all countries determined to liberate themselves from imperialist oppression.

It is in this context that Washington is debating and planning a "new policy" for the Far East.

Arming Puppet Regimes to Strengthen Control over Asia

The "new policy" of the United States is to intensify efforts to drive European countries out of their colonies and strengthen American political and economic control over Asian countries. At a meeting in Bangkok in mid-February, American diplomats focused on formulating methods for the United States to control large areas of Asia and discussed arming and funding reactionary regimes in Asia.

The United States has already given the Hatta government a loan of 100 million US dollars and supplied it with weapons, because US strategic planners hope to gain a firm foothold in Indonesia. The US State Department and military departments are formulating plans to establish a "defense line" on the northern border of Indochina. It is said that other forms of arms aid and military assistance will also be given to Bao Dai, Burma, Thailand, South Korea and India.

The United States is planning to pave the way for a replica of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an aggressive Pacific military and political alliance, with the help of the Asian version of the Marshall Plan.

In Europe, a re-militarized West Germany will be the main base of the alliance; in the Far East, Japan is being assigned that role. The US occupation authorities in Japan are adopting a policy that is definitely intended to revive Japan's war industrial potential. Newspaper reports say that Japanese industry is already producing almost all types of weapons. MacArthur has lifted all restrictions established by the Far Eastern Commission regarding the tonnage and speed of new Japanese ships. The Japanese Navy is obtaining funds from the so-called "counterpart funds" controlled by MacArthur to build the navy. Under the recent US plan, the Japanese police force, with about 500,000 soldiers, will become the core of the revived Japanese army, and they are receiving training in various forms of military operations.

Using Japanese Soldiers to Massacre the Chinese People

The author pointed out that Japanese soldiers are being used for piratical wars against the Chinese people. Japanese pilots participated in the air raid on Shanghai. The "unofficial" Japanese Expeditionary Air Force has established a headquarters in Taiwan, and the work of recruiting aviation personnel to participate in the Expeditionary Air Force is being carried out publicly with the approval of MacArthur's headquarters. At the same time, special organizations are recruiting former Japanese army personnel to participate in the French Expeditionary Corps against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Japan has definitely been selected as the main US military base in the Pacific. Washington has no intention of withdrawing US troops from Japan, even after concluding a peace treaty with Japan. The US plan for a separate peace with Japan is closely related to plans to increase the number of US troops stationed in Japan and establish new naval and air bases on Japanese territory. The recent visit of the Chiefs of Staff to Japan resulted in a plan to allow the United States to obtain permanent bases on the three islands of Japan.

An important link in the US base chain across the Asian coast is Okinawa. In Guam, the US authorities have begun large-scale construction of military equipment. Large-scale construction of bunkers has long been carried out on the northern wing of the US strategic line of aggression. Two naval bases have been established in Alaska, with two squadrons of naval aviation and a large army air force, equipped with B-29 bombers, jet fighters, and so on. The southern wing of the US strategic line consists of Taiwan (where the United States has no less than ten large naval and air force bases), the Philippines (which is now being transformed into a huge US war base), and Australia. The United States is constantly increasing its naval and air strength in the Pacific. According to official materials, the US Pacific Fleet now includes two "Essex" class aircraft carriers, two escort aircraft carriers, four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, forty-six destroyers, and a large number of submarines. In mid-April, another aircraft carrier, two cruisers, six destroyers and submarines will be transferred from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

Using the Tito Group for Espionage Activities

US imperialists are intensifying and expanding espionage and sabotage activities in Asia as an integral part of their aggression plan. Recently, the traitorous Tito group is being used for this purpose, and plans to turn the Yugoslav embassy in Delhi into a central spy bureau, from which a number of agents, secret agents, and spies acting under the instructions of US and British intelligence agencies will be sent to various parts of Asia to divide the national liberation movement. Another tool of US intelligence activities is the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is mainly engaged in collecting political, economic, and military intelligence about the Soviet Union from repatriated Japanese people under the instructions of MacArthur's headquarters, and in spreading anti-Soviet slanders.

Any Adventurous Attempts by US Imperialism Will Meet with Greater Failure

The author concludes: Remilitarizing Japan and turning Japan into a major military base for aggressive war against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and military intervention in Asian countries (whose people are fighting for independence); intensifying war preparations in the Pacific; further encroaching on European countries' colonies in Asia - this is the essence of US imperialism's new Far East plan and behavior. If this is any different from the previous bankrupt line, it is only to a greater degree of adventurousness. The Soviet Union's persistent, resolute, and purposeful struggle for the rapid conclusion of a democratic peace treaty with Japan and for the demilitarization and democratic transformation of Japan is all the more significant in terms of promoting peace and international security. There is no doubt that, in the current international situation, any attempt to engage in new imperialist adventures in the Far East will meet with a greater failure than the failure suffered by Japan in 1945.

　　美帝对远东的“新政策”  武装日本、侵略亚洲、准备战争
    ·新时代杂志发表马尔科夫评论·
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：新时代杂志顷刊载马尔科夫所作题为《美国对远东的“新政策”》一文，揭露美国对远东国家的政策。马尔科夫写道：美国国务院正式承认的美国对华政策的破产，等于输掉了投在干涉主义赌博中的六十多亿美元。美国已经无可挽救地丧失了庞大的中国市场和对于一个拥有丰富天然资源与人力资源国家的殖民地统治。
    美国为了巩固它在菲律宾、印度支那、南朝鲜、缅甸与泰国的地位，在一九四五年至一九四九年间，曾经用补助、信用贷款、贷款和财产转移等方式在这些国家内花费了二十五亿元以上，但也未能达到目的。亚洲各民族在伟大的中国人民的胜利鼓舞之下，正日益加紧对帝国主义者的抵抗。亚洲的景象已不再是这里一个那里一个孤立的反帝斗争中心了；亚洲已变成决定要从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的各国人民的不可轻侮的战线。
    就在这种情况下，华盛顿在辩论策划对远东的“新政策”的问题。
  武装各傀儡政权加强对亚洲控制
    美国的“新政策”是要加紧努力把欧洲国家从它们的殖民地驱逐出去，并加强美国对亚洲国家的政治与经济控制。美国外交家们于二月中旬在曼谷开会，集中力量拟制美国控制亚洲大片地区的方法，并讨论武装与资助亚洲各反动政权的问题。
    美国已经给了哈达政府一亿美元的贷款，并还供给它武器，因为美国战略计划者希望在印尼得到稳固的立足点。美国国务院与军事部门正在拟订在印度支那北部边界建立“防线”的计划。据说对保大、缅甸、泰国、南朝鲜和印度，也要给以其他形式的武器援助及军事援助。
    美国正打算在马歇尔计划亚洲版的帮助下，为北大西洋公约的翻版、侵略性的太平洋军事与政治同盟铺平道路。
    在欧洲，重新军事化的西德将是同盟的主要基地；在远东，日本正被派定担任那个角色。美国驻日占领当局正采取着确定地打算复活日本战争工业潜力的方针。报纸消息说：日本工业已在生产几乎一切式样的武器。麦克阿瑟已撤销了远东委员会建立的一切有关新的日本船舶的吨数与速度的限制。日本海军正从麦克阿瑟控制的所谓“对等基金”中取得资金建设海军。在最近的美国计划下，拥有五十万左右兵士的日本警察部队将要成为复活的日本陆军的核心，他们正在受各种形式的军事作战训练。
  利用日本军人屠杀中国人民
    作者指出：日本军人正被用来对中国人的海盗式的战争。日本飞行员曾参加对上海的空袭。“非官方的”日本远征空军已经在台湾成立了司令部，而招募航空人员参加该远征空军的工作，正在麦克阿瑟总部的赞成下公开地进行着。同时还有特别的组织招募前日本陆军人员参加反对越南民主共和国的法国远征军团。
    日本已确定地被挑定作为美国在太平洋的主要军事基地。华盛顿毫不打算自日本撤退美国军队，甚至在与日本缔结和约后也不打算撤退。美国与日本单独媾和的计划，与增加驻日美军人数和在日本领土上建立新的海空基地的计划有密切联系。参谋长们最近的访日，产生了一个计划，要使美国在日本三岛获得永久基地。
    亚洲海岸对面的美国基地环链中的重要一环是冲绳岛。在关岛，美国当局已着手大事建筑军事设备。碉堡的大规模建筑，很久就在美国战略侵略线的北翼进行。在阿拉斯加已建立了两个海军基地，有海军航空队两个中队和很大一队陆军航空队，拥有Ｂ——２９型轰炸机、喷射式战斗机等等。美国战略线的南翼，由台湾（美国在此地有不下十个大海空军基地）、菲律宾（现在正改为美国的巨大的战争基地）、和澳大利亚组成。美国在太平洋的海空实力正在不断地增加中。根据官方材料：美国的太平洋舰队现在包括两艘“爱赛克斯”级航空母舰、两艘护航航空母舰、四艘重巡洋舰、一艘轻巡洋舰、四十六艘驱逐舰及大批潜艇。四月中旬，将有另外一艘航空母舰、两艘巡洋舰、六艘驱逐舰和潜艇自大西洋调到太平洋。
  利用铁托集团进行间谍活动
    美帝国主义者正加紧与扩大在亚洲的间谍和破坏活动，作为它的侵略计划的一个组成部分。最近，叛卖的铁托集团正被利用来进行这一目的，并打算把驻在德里的南斯拉夫大使馆变为中央间谍局，从这个局里，将有一些在美英特务机关的训示下活动的特务人员、密探、及间谍派到亚洲各地，去分化民族解放运动。美国谍报活动的另一个工具是日本外务省。它主要是在麦克阿瑟总部的指示下，从事从被遣回国的日本人方面搜集有关苏联的政治、经济、及军事谍报，并从事散布反苏的诽谤。
  美帝任何冒险企图都将遭到更大失败
    作者结语称：使日本重新军国主义化与变日本为主要作战基地，以对苏联和中华人民共和国进行侵略战争和对亚洲各国（这些国家的人民正在为争取独立而斗争）进行军事干涉；在太平洋，加紧进行战争准备；更进一步地侵入欧洲国家在亚洲的殖民地——这就是美帝国主义新的远东计划和行为的实质。如果说这与先前的破产的路线有任何不同的话，那就只是更大程度的冒险性。苏联为了争取迅速与日本缔结民主的和约，争取日本非军国主义化与民主改造而对战争贩子们进行的坚持不渝的、坚决的、有目的的斗争，从这一方面来看，对于促进和平与国际安全是更加有意义的。毫无疑问，在目前的国际情况下，在远东从事新的帝国主义冒险的任何企图，都将遭到比日本在一九四五年所遭受的失败更大的失败。
