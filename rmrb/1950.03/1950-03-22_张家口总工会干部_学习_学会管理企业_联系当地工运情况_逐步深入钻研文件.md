	Zhangjiakou Trade Union Cadres
	Study "Learn to Manage Enterprises"
	Connecting with Local Labor Movement Conditions, Gradually Delving into the Document
[This Newspaper's Report] Zhangjiakou City Trade Union cadres are deeply studying the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises." On the 28th of last month, Mayor Sun Jingwen made a special report on studying "Learn to Manage Enterprises." The city's Trade Union immediately convened a meeting, forming a central study group of seven people, including the Trade Union director and heads of various departments, to lead the study of this document by the union's office cadres. A preliminary general test was held on the 5th of this month, and further in-depth study is now continuing.
	At the beginning of the study, general cadres reflected that the document included too many and too complex problems, making it difficult to understand and delve into. Some comrades said: "I understood it at a glance; I had already read it." "I can recite the whole text; how else should I study it?" Everyone lacked a deep understanding of the spirit of the document and did not recognize its importance. The leadership graded and returned the test papers, asking everyone to check them, clarify some basic concepts, and then further study specific issues. For example: What is enterprise management? How can we improve democratic factory management? What is the economic accounting system? After this period of study, general cadres have learned about some issues and realized that there are many things that should be and can be learned inside the factory. Some people who were previously unwilling to go to factories now want to go; some people who did not read the newspaper in the past have now begun to pay attention to the Workers' Daily. The current study focuses on the central group, requiring each member of the group to study specific topics and make special reports to help everyone learn. At the same time, it is necessary to connect with the actual situation of the Zhangjiakou labor movement, examine their past work, and further implement the spirit of the editorial to the masses of workers.

　　张家口总工会干部
    学习“学会管理企业”
    联系当地工运情况  逐步深入钻研文件
    【本报讯】张家口市总工会干部深入学习人民日报社论“学会管理企业”。该市于上月二十八日，曾由孙敬文市长作了关于学习“学会管理企业”的专题报告。该市总工会当即召集会议，以工会主任和各部门负责人七人组成中心学习小组，领导该会机关干部进行此一文件的学习。本月五日举行了初次普遍测验，现正继续进一步深入学习。
    在开始学习时，一般干部反映，文件里面所包括的问题太多，太复杂，不好懂，钻不进去。有的同志则说：“我一看就懂，早就看过了。”“我把全文都能背过来，还要怎么学。”大家对文件的精神没有深刻的了解，对其重要性也认识不够。领导上把测验的卷子批改发回，要求大家检查一下，把一些基本概念搞清楚，再进一步学习专门问题。例如：什么是经营企业化？怎样才能搞好工厂管理民主化？什么是经济核算制等。经过这一时期的学习，一般干部已经知道了一些问题，而且认识了工厂里面应该学习，可以学习的东西很多。有的人过去不愿下工厂的现在要求去了；有的人过去不看报，现在开始注意看工人日报了。目前的学习，则以中心小组为重点，要求该组每个人研究专题，作专题报告，以帮助大家学习。同时，要联系张市工运的实际情况，检查自己过去的工作，进一步把社论的精神贯彻到工人群众中去。（胡哲）
