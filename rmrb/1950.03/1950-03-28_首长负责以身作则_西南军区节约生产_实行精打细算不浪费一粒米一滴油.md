Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 26th: The People's Liberation Army Southwest Military Region's various units are actively launching a thrift and production movement.

　　The Southwest Military Region's directly subordinate teams, organs, and troops first launched a streamlining and thrift campaign. Military Region leaders took the lead by setting an example, vacating housing, ceasing small kitchens, and saving a group of administrative personnel, who were transferred to necessary work positions. The CCP committees of various provincial military regions have also successively convened cadre meetings, with the heads of each department leading the organization of thrift and production committees, arranging streamlining, thrift, and production construction work.

　　All organs and troops of the entire military region consistently and strictly implement the spirit of thrift, carefully budgeting, starting with small things. A certain special forces unit launched a "not wasting a single grain of rice" movement; the transportation department put forward the slogan "not wasting a drop of gasoline," insisting on not driving cars without urgent tasks, turning off the engine when parking, not using gasoline to wash oil stains on hands, and using alcohol instead of gasoline, and other thrift measures. All cadres and soldiers of the entire military region troops carry coal and rice themselves to save on transportation costs.

　　Some troops, in the intervals of suppressing bandits and reforming uprising troops and performing local work team tasks, also actively engaged in production. The Chengdu Garrison Troops of the Western Sichuan Military Region participated in repairing and dredging the rivers around Chengdu City, undertaking 20,000 cubic meters of riverbed engineering, which commenced on the 14th of this month and is scheduled to be completed before the 29th. The four rivers Fu, Nan, Jin, and Yu around Chengdu City, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, have not been repaired or dredged for more than ten years. Whenever there is continuous rain, the accumulated water in the city cannot be discharged, and the citizens suffer deeply. After liberation, the Municipal People's Government mobilized citizens to repair and dredge them, but the project was huge, and manpower and financial resources were insufficient. The Military Region leaders called on the city's garrison troops and directly subordinate teams of the Military Control Commission to participate in this repair task. After the start of construction, the commanders and fighters were in high spirits, and a certain company completed seven days of planned work in three days. In January, the Western Sichuan Military Region troops rushed to repair the Dujiangyan irrigation project in Guanxian County, which will save 3.5 million mu of farmland in fifteen cities and counties in western Sichuan from floods. A certain unit of the Eastern Sichuan Military Region, in addition to ensuring the completion of bandit suppression and the transformation of uprising troops, has decided to launch vegetable planting, transportation, construction and other work, to achieve the goal of one month's self-sufficiency in grain. The Southern Sichuan Military Region is preparing to set up supply cooperatives to unify the procurement and transportation of grain, daily necessities, etc.

　　Troops and organs that do not undertake or undertake fewer bandit suppression tasks widely use abandoned land and wasteland to grow vegetables, and stipulate the task of delivering one month to six months of vegetables according to the actual situation. In urban organs and troops, sideline production is generally carried out; troops stationed in more concentrated areas carry out transportation or contract for road and canal repairs.

　　The construction work and the manufacture of tables, benches, furniture, etc., in the stationing areas of the troops are all done by themselves. A certain supply regiment of the Military Region Logistics Department built a 200-room parking factory. In addition to purchasing bamboo materials, cadres and soldiers did the rest themselves, such as filling the foundation, transporting materials, and building carports. The cadres and soldiers of the Supply Department and the Guard Regiment opened up the roads around the station themselves, saving a large sum of wages.

　　首长负责以身作则
    西南军区节约生产
    实行精打细算不浪费一粒米一滴油
    【新华社重庆二十六日电】人民解放军西南军区各部队，积极展开节约、生产运动。
    西南军区直属队机关、部队，首先展开整编节约工作，军区首长以身作则，腾出房子、停止小灶，节省出一批事务人员，转到必要的工作岗位。各省级军区中共党委也相继召开了干部会议，由各部负责人领导组织节约生产委员会，布置整编节约和生产建设的工作。
    全军区各机关、部队，一致严格贯彻节约精神，精打细算，从小处做起。特种兵某部，展开“不浪费一粒米”运动；运输部门提出“不浪费一滴汽油”的口号，坚持没有紧急任务不开驶汽车、停车即熄火、洗手上的油腻不用汽油、用酒精代汽油等节约办法。全军区部队的干部、战士都是自己背煤、背米，以节省运费。
    若干部队在剿匪和改造起义部队及执行地方工作队任务的空隙，也积极进行生产。川西军区成都市警备部队参加修浚成都市区周围河道，担负河床工程两万方，已于本月十四日开工，预定二十九日以前完成。成都市区周围府、南、金、御四河，在国民党反动统治下，十余年来未加修浚，一遇霪雨，城内积水无法宣泄，市民深以为苦；解放后，市人民政府即动员市民加以修浚，但工程浩大，人力、财力均感不足。军区首长即号召市警备部队及军管会直属队参加此一修浚任务。动工后，指战员们情绪高涨，某连在三天中完成七天的计划。在一月间，川西军区部队曾抢修灌县都江堰水利工程，将使川西十五市、县三百五十万亩良田得免水患。川东军区某部，除保证完成剿匪和改造起义部队任务外，已决定展开种菜、运输、修建等工作，以达成自给粮食一个月的目标。川南军区正筹办供应合作社，统一采运供应粮食、日用品等。
    不担任或较少担任剿匪任务的部队、机关，广泛利用废地、荒地种菜，按实际情况分别规定交一个月至半年菜蔬的任务。在城市的机关、部队，普遍开办副业生产；驻地较集中的部队进行运输或包修公路、水渠的工作。
    各部队驻地修建工作，和制造桌、凳、家具等，都由自己动手来做。军区后勤部某辎重团修建二百间的停车厂，除购买竹料外，其余如填地基、运材料、盖车棚等都由干部、战士自己动手。供给部、警卫团的干部、战士，自己动手开辟驻地周围的公路，节省了一大笔工资。
