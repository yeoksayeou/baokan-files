    Jin Bao Niang
    Painting by Xing Lian
    (Based on Ma Feng's novel: "A Lowly Woman")
    (Thirty-three)
    Niang (mother) was sick with malaria, rolling on the kang (brick bed) and talking nonsense. Cui Cui had just finished cleaning the house and settled Niang down to sleep when Jin Bao started crying from hunger again. Cui Cui had just nursed Jin Bao to sleep when Niang started talking nonsense again. Niang was so sick that Cui Cui wanted to ask a doctor to come and see her, but she didn't have a single penny.
    (Thirty-four)
    In the afternoon, Gui Cai sent Liu Shunyi's wife from Shunyi Store to talk marriage to Cui Cui. Liu Shunyi's wife was an experienced matchmaker. She first called Cui Cui to her house to test the waters, saying, "Gen Yuan is already dead, and you are so young, you should find a husband and seek a good life for the rest of your days. With your looks, as long as you are willing, even a wealthy family would welcome you with open arms!" Aunt Shunyi took out two banknotes from her waist and said, "This is what Gui Cai sent you." Cui Cui took the banknotes and threw them on the ground, saying, "I would rather starve to death than take his stinking money!"
    (Thirty-five)
    Aunt Shunyi was also suffering because Shunyi Store was occupying Liu Guicai's land, and Liu Guicai wouldn't let it go if this matter wasn't settled. After a while, Aunt Shunyi persuaded her again, "Young people, it's not a big deal, every family has its dark side. Women have this ability! Just think about your Niang's illness, and raising Jin Bao to adulthood... once or twice won't ruin your reputation." Cui Cui thought of her Niang being so sick without money for treatment, and Jin Bao being so thin. Hearing Aunt Shunyi's words, her heart felt like a tangled mess, and she didn't say anything for a long time, just lowered her head and kept crying.
    (Thirty-six)
    Aunt Shunyi thought that if she couldn't make a deal with Gui Cai, she could get her involved first, and then it would be easier. She said, "It doesn't have to be Gui Cai, a company commander is staying at our store, and he's a wealthy man. You can accompany him, no one will know, and you can earn some money. Your Niang's illness will be cured, and you'll have food and drink at home. Once or twice isn't a big deal." Cui Cui's face turned red, and she lowered her head and didn't say anything... As it got dark, Cui Cui took two yuan back home.

    金宝娘
    邢琏画
    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （三十三）
    娘害了打摆子病，在炕上又打滚又说胡话。翠翠刚把家收拾干净，安顿娘睡好，金宝又饿得哭起来。翠翠刚把金宝奶睡，娘又说开胡话。娘病成了那样，翠翠想请个医生来看看，但一个钱也没有。
    （三十四）
    下午贵财就打发顺义店刘顺义老婆，给翠翠说媒。刘顺义老婆是个拉皮条的老行手。她把翠翠先叫到家探了探口气，说：“根元已经死了，你这年青青地该找个婆家，寻自己下半辈子的好活。就凭你这一表人材，只要你肯，财主家也双手接待哩！”顺义婶从腰里拿出两张票子来说：“这是人家贵财送你的。”翠翠把票子接过来扔在地上，说：“我饿死也不要他的臭钱！”
    （三十五）
    顺义婶也是受夹板罪，顺义店占着刘贵财家的地方，办不行这事刘贵财便不依。停了一会，顺义婶又劝道：“年青人，也不算个甚，谁家锅底没有黑？女人就有这个本事么！就说为你娘病，为把金宝抚养成人也该……一次半次也坏不了名声。”翠翠想到娘病成那样没钱治，金宝瘦的那样子，听了顺义婶的话，心中像抖乱麻一样，半天没开言，低下头不住的掉泪。
    （三十六）
    顺义婶想一下和贵财闹不成，先把她拉下水就好办了。就说：“不要贵财也行，我们店里住下个连长，可是个有钱主，你去陪陪人家，人不知鬼不觉，赚几个钱，你娘的病也治了，家里也有吃喝了。一半次，也没甚要紧。”翠翠脸成了红布，低头没说话。……天黑时分，翠翠拿着两块钱回到了家。
