　　Preliminary Experiences in Sand Desert Afforestation and Nursery Raising
    Here, we summarize some of the experiences we have gained in sand desert afforestation and nursery techniques over the past year, hoping that readers will exchange ideas and draw on collective wisdom.
  Nursery Raising
    The tree species we cultivate mainly include desert species such as Populus simonii, Amorpha fruticosa, Lespedeza bicolor, Robinia pseudoacacia, peach, and apricot, as well as some Platycladus orientalis, maple, mulberry, and black jujube. Nursery methods are divided into cuttings and sowing. Sowing is partly done by fine-grained seedbeds and partly by rough seeding on flat ground. In order to quickly eliminate sand deserts, we vigorously organize public and private nurseries in various counties. These nurseries are extremely dispersed and difficult to lead technically. Therefore, we must study a rough seeding method that is easy, labor-saving, and economical, so as to promote it to the masses and make it easy to master.
    (1) Populus simonii Cutting Propagation Method (general cuttings can be used as reference)
    1. Selection of branches: It is best to use one-year-old, well-developed branches with few forks, complete leaf buds, and the thickness of a pen tube.
    2. Cutting branches: Start cutting from the thick end, each section is six to seven inches long, and each small end must have a complete leaf bud. Discard the thin and weak ends.
    3. Cutting period: Autumn cuttings are done after leaf fall and before the ground freezes; spring cuttings are done after thawing and before budding.
    4. Cutting method: According to a row spacing of one foot and a plant spacing of eight inches, insert the cuttings into the soil, with one bud of the small end facing upward and level with the ground. Compact the soil and water it. If autumn cuttings are used, add a two-inch-high soil embankment on each row to prevent cold and other damage. Before the spring warm weather and budding, open the soil embankment to slightly expose the top bud to the ground and continue watering. Seedlings can grow to six or seven feet high in one year.
    5. Precautions: (1) If the collected branches are not inserted immediately, they must be properly preserved. It is best to dig a pit in a shady place and bury them with wet soil to avoid wind or sun drying. (2) Spring cuttings should not be too late. It is difficult to survive if they are inserted after budding. (3) When inserting, do not expose too much of the ground. If it is too high, it will evaporate excessively and easily wither. (4) Water more after insertion to prevent the ground from drying out.
    (2) Sowing Large-Grain Hard-Shell Seeds
    Large-grain hard-shell seeds of sand desert trees mainly include peach and apricot. When sowing these seeds in spring, it is necessary to carry out "open-air burial method" in the winter of the previous year, that is, dig a pit one and a half to two feet deep in the ground, the width and breadth depending on the amount of seeds. First, select the seeds with water, then mix them with fine sand to make them even, put them in the pit, about half a foot thick, and then fill it with sandy soil and fully water it. In spring, wait for the seed shells to crack before sowing. Pick out the uncracked ones and bury them in wet soil. After four or five days, select and sow them again. After three times, those that still do not crack can be discarded.
    When selecting peach and apricot seeds, new seeds (those of the current year) must be selected. Old ones do not germinate or germinate very little. This needs to be noted. The outer shell and kernel skin of new seeds are fresh orange-brown, while those of old seeds are black-brown. You can see the difference by comparing them.
    (3) Sowing Small-Grain Hard-Skinned Seeds
    In sandy areas, small-grain hard-skinned seeds mainly include Amorpha fruticosa, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Lespedeza bicolor. When sowing, first soak them in hot water (two parts boiling and one part cold) for one day and night, then take them out, put them in a reed basket or other container, and place them in a warm place in the same way as sprouting beans. Rinse them with hot water every day until they are about to sprout. Then, use a rake to furrow the prepared sowing ground. Water along the furrows and spread the seeds into the furrows by hand. Then, level the furrows and rake them again to make the soil fine and dense, covering them with more than two inches of soil that can maintain long-term soil moisture.
    This extensive nursery method, like general crop planting, does not use seedbeds. It has many advantages, the main ones being: (1) It is easy to cultivate and weed. (2) General agricultural tools can be used. (3) The seedlings grow strong and can be taken out of the nursery after autumn of the same year. (4) The method is simple and saves labor.
    If sowing in a seedbed, the bed must be thoroughly moistened first, then sow the seeds, cover them with fine soil and fine sand, and gently press them flat with a wooden board.
    (4) Sowing Fine-Grain Seeds
    When sowing fine-grain seeds (mainly Populus simonii, willow, Tamarix chinensis, etc.), collect and sow them after the seeds mature. Do not store them for a long time, because these seeds have a very short germination validity period. Storing them for a long time will lose their germination effect. When sowing, first prepare the land into ridges (seedbeds), and the soil on the ridge surface should be fine and flat. Then, water heavily. Before the water seeps in, sow the seeds in the water to make them even. After the water seeps in, cover them thinly with rice straw without covering soil. All seeds can germinate in three days. Within half a month after sowing, the ridge surface must be kept shaded and moist, otherwise the seedlings will easily wither. The covering straw can be removed after twenty days.
  Afforestation
    The main tree species for afforestation in dry sand deserts and riverbank sand deserts in western Hebei are Populus simonii, with interspersed Celtis sinensis, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Ziziphus jujuba. Amorpha fruticosa was only promoted after autumn last year. Therefore, in this area, 90% of the afforestation methods involve layering. Over the past year, based on scientific principles, actual conditions, and the years of afforestation experience of the masses, we have combined them and taken a step forward, exploring some experiences.
    (1) Layering (burying branches) and cuttings
    1. Arch Layering Method: In the past, the masses generally used cross-layering and inverted arch-layering methods (with the arch facing downwards and both ends exposed to the ground). Because the seasonal winds in this area are very strong in spring, the spring drought lasts particularly long, and the summer sun is very strong, the above-mentioned layering methods are easily dried out by the wind and sun, and the survival rate is very low. After experimental research, the arch-layering method is the most suitable, which can guarantee a survival rate of more than 80%. When using the arch-layering method, the pit should be more than one and a half feet deep (more than two feet in dry sand deserts), and the pit should be about one and a half feet long. Dig straight down on one side (at a right angle to the ground) and diagonally down on the other side (at an acute angle to the ground), forming a triangular pit with a pointed bottom. Insert the large end of a one- or two-year-old branch about three feet long into the deep (right-angled) side, bend the tip of the branch towards the shallow (acute-angled) side, fill half the pit with soil and compact it, then fill the pit completely and compact it. In this way, both ends take root, and buds emerge in the middle, with sufficient moisture and vigorous growth.
    Special attention should be paid to the fact that when using the arch-layering method, the sapling must be close to the side of the pit, so that it is easier to take root and the technology is easier to master. If it is placed in the middle of the pit and filled with soil on both sides, it will not be easy to compact, and it is also easy to break the back of the arch and damage the leaf buds. Furthermore, do not use too much force when bending the arch to avoid injuring the branch.
    In spring, the back of the arch should be level with the ground, appearing to be exposed but not. During the rainy season, leave three or four inches deep unfilled with soil, and the back of the arch should be one or two inches higher than the pit surface to avoid scalding by hot sand, and it should be close to the south side of the pit to avoid being dried by strong sunlight (the bark becomes black after being scalded by hot sand, and the germination rate is small). After autumn, it should be level with the ground, and one or two inches of soil should be sealed on the sandy land to prevent wind drying.
    Use one- or two-year-old tender branches that grow from young trees during the rainy season, and use one- to two-year-old branches that grow from old trees after autumn. This way, the germination power is strong and the survival rate is high. After autumn, because the branches are long, they can be cut into more than two feet long. The thick ones can be planted as stumps and covered with soil mounds, and the thin ones can be layered. This saves saplings and makes it easier to survive.
    In wet sandy land, you can use a hoe to dig a rectangular pit for layering. One person can master the technology quickly and well.
    2. If using seedlings cultivated from cuttings in the same year for afforestation after autumn, because they are tender and brittle, they cannot be used for the arch-layering method. It is best to cut them into sections (each section about two feet long), dig a small pit diagonally, and insert two branches diagonally in a dispersed manner, which is easy to compact. Especially when creating windbreak forest belts, it can be densely planted and neat.
    (2) Planting Trees
    When planting Ziziphus jujuba and Pyrus betulifolia in dry sandy land, use one- or two-year-old seedlings about two feet high in spring and the rainy season. When removing seedlings, bring more roots. Choose strong seedlings. The pit should be larger. When planting, keep the roots in their original growth state, burying them three or four inches deeper than before. After filling half the pit with soil, gently lift the seedling to allow the soil to bond closely with the roots. Then, fill the pit and compact it, leaving a small pool for storing rainwater. It is best to cut off the tender shoots of the tree head to strengthen its drought resistance. When planting trees after autumn, the branches and shoots must be sealed with soil. When sealing the upper part of Pyrus betulifolia with soil, the branches and shoots can be intertwined and buckled together, and burying the soil will make it more compact.
    Plant peach and apricot trees with one-year-old strong seedlings, Ulmus pumila and Sophora japonica with two-year-old seedlings, and Robinia pseudoacacia with one-year-old seedlings. Populus canadensis can be planted with wild seedlings of the same year when afforesting after autumn, and the planting method is the same as above. However, when planting peach and apricot trees after autumn, all the branches above the ground should be cut off, leaving only a tree trunk more than three inches long and sealing it with a soil mound. The germination will be particularly strong next spring. If only part of the tree is cut off or not at all, the seedling must be bent to the ground and buried with soil. It should be dug open after germination next spring. Half of the branches of Ulmus pumila seedlings must also be removed. As for Sophora japonica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Populus canadensis, etc., they must be cut off four inches above the ground and sealed with soil.
    Last year, during the rainy season, various one-and-a-half-year-old wild seedlings were tried to be planted in sandy loam. They were planted after heavy rain without watering, and half of the shoots of the seedlings were cut off. As a result, Pyrus betulifolia, Ziziphus jujuba, and Ulmus pumila all survived more than 95%, Populus canadensis survived 84%, and Ailanthus altissima survived 63%.
    (3) Others
    1. Afforestation in sandy land must be densely planted to exert the effect of windbreak and sand fixation.
    2. Afforestation in sandy land must be deeply buried, tightly compacted, and less exposed (soil mounds should be sealed after autumn).
    3. When creating windbreak forests for cultivated land, first block the wind gap and establish a windbreak forest belt.
    4. When afforesting large areas of sand deserts, it is best to organize cooperative afforestation and establish a windbreak forest network. Develop perennial grasses and fruit trees in the open space protected by the forest network (we plan ten acres per block). This can quickly eliminate large areas of sand deserts with fewer seedlings and labor, and can achieve the purpose of dense planting within the forest belt.
    5. When collectively creating windbreak forest networks and forest belts, arrange and plan the location at the afforestation site before afforestation, make planting ropes and bury soil mounds, and mark the plant and row spacing. In this way, when afforestation, it is easy to divide into groups and classes, launch competitions, set off a hot tide, and create neat forest belts and forest networks.
    6. Plant trees early in spring. Start immediately after the ground thaws. Plant roots first and then germinate. They are drought-resistant and easy to survive, especially in dry areas. In the warm plains of North China, it is best to plant between Jingzhe and Chunfen. It will be late by Qingming. Afforestation after autumn should be late, preferably between Lidong and Xiaoxue. At this time, the seedlings shed their leaves and hibernate without damaging their vitality, and farmers also have time to participate in afforestation.

　　沙荒造林与育苗的初步经验
    这里把一年来我们在沙荒造林和育苗技术上摸索到的一点经验，总结出来，并希读者多多交换意见，以求集思广益。
  育苗方面
    我们育苗树种，主要是小叶杨、紫穗槐、胡枝子、洋槐、桃、杏等沙荒树种，另外育些柏、枫、桑、黑枣等。育苗方法分插条和播种二种。播种方面一部为畦床细作播种，一部是平地粗作播种。为了迅速消灭沙荒，我们大力组织各县公营及群众私营苗圃，这些苗圃极为分散，在技术上不好领导，所以必须研究又容易又省工又经济的粗作育苗法，以便向群众推广，便于掌握。
    （一）小叶杨插条育苗法（一般插条都可参考）
    １、选条——用一年生发育充实，枝叉少，叶芽完全，笔管粗细的条子最好。
    ２、剪条——先由粗头剪起，每截长六、七寸，每截小头必须有一个完整的叶芽，梢端细弱的丢去不用。
    ３、插期——秋插在落叶后地冻前；春插在解冻后发芽前。
    ４、插法——按行距一尺，株距八寸，扦插土中，使小头一芽向上，与地皮取平，踩实灌水。若秋插时，每行上再封二寸高的土埝，以防寒及其他损害，到春暖发芽前，再把土埝拨开，使顶端一芽微露地面，继续灌水，一年就能生长六、七尺高的苗子。
    ５、注意事项：（１）采下的条子如不当时扦插时，必须妥善保存，最好在背阴处刨坑用湿土埋上，以免受风干或晒干。（２）春插不能太晚，在发芽后再插不易成活。（３）插时不可露出地面过高，过高则蒸发过度，容易枯死。（４）插后要多灌水，勿使地面干燥。
    （二）播种大粒硬壳种籽
    沙荒树种大粒硬壳种籽，主要是桃、杏等，这些种籽在春季播种时，必须在前一年冬天行“露天埋藏法”，就是在地下挖一尺半至二尺深的坑，宽广按种籽多少而定，把种籽先用水选，再混些细沙，使之均匀，放入坑内，约半尺厚，再用沙土填平，充分灌水，春天待种壳裂开后再行点播，把未裂开的拣出，再埋入湿土里，四、五天后再选播一次，经三次后仍不崩裂的可扔弃不种。
    桃杏选种时必须选用新种籽（当年生的），陈的不发芽，或发芽很少，这是需要注意的。新的种籽外壳与仁皮都是新鲜橙褐色，陈的是黑褐色，一比较就可以看出来。
    （三）播种小粒硬皮的种籽
    小粒硬皮的种籽，在沙荒区主要是紫穗槐、洋槐、胡枝子等，播种时先用两开一凉的热水浸过，经一昼夜，再捞出，装入席篓或其他容器内，与生豆芽方法一样，放在温暖地方，每日用热水冲一次，到将出芽的时候，再把准备播种的地，用耧挑成沟，顺沟浇水把种子用手顺沟撒入沟内，然后把沟挑平，再擦一遍，使土细密，盖上二寸多厚，能长期保持地湿。
    这个粗放的育苗法，像一般种庄稼一样，不作苗床，他的优点多，主要的是（１）便于中耕除草。（２）一般农具都能利用上。（３）苗木长的健旺，当年秋后就能出圃。（４）方法简便，节省劳动力。
    如在苗床播种，亦须先将床湿透，然后播种，上面筛以细土及细沙，用木板轻轻压平。
    （四）播种微粒种籽
    播种微粒种籽时（主要是小叶杨，柳，柽柳等），种子成熟后，采下就播，不可长期贮藏，因这些种子发芽有效期很短，贮藏久了就失去发芽的作用。播种时先把地打成畦（苗床），畦面土要细要平，然后大量浇水，勿等水渗即把种子撒播水中，使之均匀，水渗后再薄盖一层谷草，不覆土，三天即可全部发芽。在播种后半月内，畦面务须保持荫湿，否则苗易枯死，二十天后即可把覆草除去。
  造林方面
    冀西干沙荒和沿河沙荒造林，主要的树种是小叶杨，间有杜树，洋槐，酸枣等，去年在秋后才开始推广紫穗槐。因此，在这一地区造林方法，百分之九十是压条，一年来根据科学原理，实际情况，以及群众的多年造林经验，结合起来，提高一步，摸索出一些经验来。
    （一）压条（压卜子）及插条
    １、弓形压条法：群众过去普遍使用交叉压条法，和倒弓形压条法（弓背向下，两头露出地面），因为这一地区的春季季候风十分强烈，春旱的时间又特别长，夏天日晒又很剧烈，使用上述压条法，很容易被风抽干及晒死，成活率很低。经过试验研究以弓形压条法最合适，能保证成活百分之八十以上。使用弓形压条法，坑深在一尺五寸以上（干沙荒二尺以上），坑长一尺五寸左右，一边向下直挖（与地面成直角），一边向下斜挖（与地面成锐角），挖成一个三角形的尖底坑，将三尺左右长的一、二年生树枝的大头插在深的（直角的）那一边，将树梢部分弯向浅的（锐角的）一边，填半坑土踩实，再填满土踩实，这样两头札根，当中出芽，水分充足，长的旺盛。
    特别应当注意的是使用弓形压条法，树秧必须靠坑的一面，才容易生根，技术上也好掌握，如果放在坑的当中，两边填土，不易踩实，同时又容易踩折弓背，损害叶芽。再者，弯弓时不要死劲把条子折伤。
    春季弓背要与地皮平，似露不露。雨季填土留三、四寸深不填满，弓背要高出坑面一、二寸，免受热沙烫，并靠坑的南侧，免受强烈的日光晒干（受热沙烫后树皮成黑色，发芽率小）。秋后则与地皮平，沙地并封上一、二寸土以免风干。
    雨季用幼树滋生出来的一、二年生嫩条，秋后用老树上滋生出来的一至二年生枝条，这样发芽力强，成活率高。秋后因枝条长，可以截成二尺多长，粗的栽橛子，埋上土堆，细的压条。这样又省树秧，又易成活。
    在湿沙地压条可用镢头（镐）刨长方形的坑，一个人能掌握技术，又快又好。
    ２、秋后造林如用当年插条育出来的树苗，因为又嫩又脆，不能用作弓形压条法，最好截成段（每段二尺左右），斜着挖个小坑，把两根条分散斜插，容易踩实，尤其造防风林带时，既能密栽，又能整齐。
    （二）栽树
    干沙地栽酸枣树、杜梨等，在春季和雨季要用二尺左右高的一、二年生树苗，起苗时多带根，选壮实苗，坑要大一点，栽时根子保持原来生长状态，比原来深埋三、四寸，填半坑土后，将树苗轻轻提动，使土能与根密结，然后填平踩实，留一小池子，以备积存雨水，树首最好将嫩梢切掉，加强耐旱力。秋后栽树须将枝梢用土封上，杜梨上部封土时，可将枝梢互结成扣，埋土更能密实。
    栽桃、杏用一年生壮苗，榆树、槐树用二年生的苗，洋槐用一年生苗，大叶杨在秋后造林时可用当年生的野生苗，栽法与上同。不过秋后栽桃杏树时，地上枝条应全剪去，只留下三寸多长的树身，封上土堆，明春发芽特别旺。如只剪一部或全不剪时，必须把树苗弯到地皮，用土埋上，明春发芽后再刨开。榆树苗也须去一半枝条。至于槐、洋槐、大叶杨等则须齐地皮以上四寸削去，用土封好。
    去年雨季在沙质壤土试栽各种一年半生之野生苗，大雨后栽上不浇水，苗木均剪梢一半，结果杜梨、枣、酸枣、榆，均活百分之九十五以上，大叶杨活百分之八十四，臭椿活百分之六十三。
    （三）其他
    １、在沙地造林必须密栽，才能发挥挡风固沙的效用。
    ２、沙地造林必须深埋、紧砸、少露（秋后封土堆）。
    ３、造耕地防风林时，先堵风口，建立防风林带。
    ４、在大片沙荒造林，最好组织合作造林，建立防风林网，被林网保护的空地（我们计划每块十亩），发展宿根草及果树，这样能以较少的树苗、劳力，很快的消灭大面积沙荒，能在林带内达到密栽的目的。
    ５、集体造防风林网及林带时，于造林前到造林地布置，规划位置，作植绳埋土堆，划好株行距，这样当造林时，容易分组分班，开展竞赛，掀起热潮，造成整齐的林带和林网。
    ６、春季栽树要早，地消冻马上动手，栽后先扎根后发芽，耐旱易活，特别是在干燥地，华北温暖平原最好在惊蛰至春分，到清明就晚了。秋后造林要晚，最好在立冬到小雪，这时树秧落叶休眠，不伤元气，农民也有工夫参加造林。
