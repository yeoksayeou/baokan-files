　　The Tsinghua Aviation Department's Labor-Based Construction
　　Qinghua News Group

　　During the winter vacation, the faculty and students of the Tsinghua University Aviation Department engaged in labor to build their department.

　　Last summer, when the Tsinghua Aviation Department students were interning in Northeast China, they witnessed firsthand how the students there created teaching equipment and built their own school with their own hands. The students were deeply moved. Last semester, everyone deeply felt that there were still many shortcomings in the department's teaching conditions: too few charts and models, books and magazines not well organized, engines not disassembled and cleaned... Therefore, they decided to fully utilize the winter vacation, overcome difficulties, and improve their learning conditions, proposing to build the department through labor.

　　The department's construction work revolved around the curriculum. Teachers were responsible for planning and guidance. A total of thirty-five students participated in the work, accounting for 80% of the students remaining on campus. They were divided into six working groups, each of which formulated its own work plan. In order not to hinder political study and adequate rest during the winter vacation, each person worked for about two hours each day.

　　The six working groups each specialized in their respective areas. One group worked on metalwork, disassembling and cleaning a V-type twelve-cylinder liquid-cooled engine; one group worked on woodwork, making two types of aircraft control system models and aircraft aerodynamic performance models; one group drew thirty-one large charts; one group meticulously organized books needed for teaching; one group dissected nine types of aviation instruments; one group disassembled and moved a Mosquito aircraft; in addition, there were teachers mainly engaged in translating, organizing the laboratory, and repairing the wind tunnel.

　　The students were very enthusiastic, but the work was unfamiliar. Initially, they did not know how to use tools, or their skills were not proficient. Some students said, "The wood strips are so easy to break in our hands," "The more we plane, the more uneven it becomes," "The pulley wheels are becoming elliptical." The plan was to turn twelve pulleys in four hours, but only four were turned by that time; the plan was to complete two sets of models in two weeks, but it took three weeks to complete one set. But these did not discourage them; instead, they recognized their shortcomings, and thus humbly and promptly sought advice from the workers and teachers, and many difficult problems were gradually resolved.

　　In their work, they were not afraid of being tired or dirty. With a lack of materials, everyone learned to "live frugally": in the aircraft factory, it took fourteen gallons of gasoline to disassemble and clean a V-type engine, but they only used one gallon of kerosene (the machine parts for teaching purposes do not require the same cleanliness as the flight machine parts), and those doing woodwork tried to make the most of waste materials. There was also a shortage of tools; a ton-heavy engine, without a hoist, was lifted with only a few levers. When disassembling V-type valve springs, only tools suitable for radial engines were available, but everyone came up with ideas to modify them, and they could be used just the same. When installing the control stick and ailerons, they failed four times, but they did not lose hope, and finally completed it on the fifth try. Throughout the work, everyone maintained a serious work attitude, full of confidence and patience, learning while doing, and overcoming difficulties in materials and technology.

　　A month later, their work was completed. Engines, models, charts, dissected instruments... created very good conditions for this term's visual teaching methods. At the exhibition, professors from other departments and many students came to visit. At the commendation meeting for model workers and the summing-up work celebration, Mr. Dong Shouxin said, "From now on, we will no longer be able to gesticulate on the stage while you are still staring blankly and not understanding." Professor Ning Kuang said, "Only in an era like today can you young people display your wisdom."

　　清华航空系的劳动建系
    清华通讯组
    寒假里，清华大学航空系师生进行了劳动建系。
    去年夏天，清华航空系同学在东北实习的时候，亲眼看见了东北同学用自己的双手创造了教学设备，建设了自己的学校。同学们都非常感动。上学期，大家深深感觉到自己系里的教学条件还有很多缺憾：图表模型太少，书籍杂志没有更好整理，引擎没有拆洗……。于是决心充分利用寒假，克服困难，改善自己的学习条件，提出了劳动建系。
    建系工作环绕着课程教程为中心进行。由先生负责计划与指导。参加工作的同学共三十五人，占全系留校人数的百分之八十。分为六个工作组，各组自己订了工作计划。为了不妨碍寒假的政治学习及适当的休息，每人每天工作约二小时。
    六个工作组各专其业。一组金工，拆洗一个Ｖ型十二汽缸的液冷式发动机；一组木工，制作两种飞机操纵系统模型和飞机空气动力性能模型；一组绘制三十一张大图表；一组精细整理教学需要的书籍；一组剖切九种航空仪表；一组拆移蚊式机；此外还有以先生为主的翻译、整理实验室、修理风洞等工作。
    同学们热情很高，但工作是生疏的。开始时，他们不会使用工具，或者技术不纯熟。有同学说：“木条在我们手里是那么容易断”，“越刨越不平”，“滑轮车成椭圆的了”。计划四小时车完十二个滑轮，结果到时只车了四个；计划二星期作完两套模型，结果三星期才做完一套。但这些并没有使他们灰心，反而认识了自己的缺点，因之虚心地及时地向工人师傅和老师们请教，许多困难问题，也就逐渐解决了。
    在工作中，他们不怕累、不怕脏。材料缺乏，大家就学会“过穷日子”：在飞机工厂中，拆洗一个Ｖ型发动机要用十四加仑汽油，而他们只用了一加仑洋油（教学用的机件并不要求与飞行机件同样洁净），作木工的尽量利用了废料。工具也很缺乏，一吨重的发动机，没有吊挂，只用几根杠子也就抬了起来。拆Ｖ型汽门弹簧时，只有适用于辐射型的工具，大家想法修改后，一样也可以使用了。按装操纵杆和副翼时，失败了四次，但他们不失望，第五次终于完成了。在整个工作中，大家以严肃的工作态度，充满着信心和耐心，一边做一边学，克服了材料和技术上的困难。
    一个月后，他们的工作完成了。发动机、模型、图表、剖切过的仪表……为本期的形象教学法创设了很好的条件。展览会上，别系的教授和很多同学都来参观。在表扬模范、总结工作的庆功大会上，董寿莘先生说：“从今以后，再不会我们在台上指手划脚，而你们还瞠目不知所云了。”宁榥教授说：“只有在今天这样的时代里，你们青年才能发挥自己的智慧。”
