　　Northwest Steel Company's Rolling Mill
    Sets New Production Record Again
    Exceeding the Period of Japanese Occupation by 84 Percent
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Shanxi Daily News: The Rolling Mill of Taiyuan Northwest Steel Company, following its surpassing of the production target by 18 percent in December of last year, creating a new production record for the first time, has, with the redoubled efforts of all workers, engineers, and staff, again exceeded the production target by 30 percent in January of this year, creating a new production record again. This new record exceeds the highest output during the Japanese occupation period in April 1943 by 84 percent, and exceeds the highest output during the rule of the Yan Xishan bandit gang in November 1948 by 73 percent.
    The achievements mentioned above are due to the following reasons: 1. The Rolling Mill launched a large-scale inspection campaign involving all employees in late November and early December of last year, discovering and resolving many problems related to machine repair and safety equipment, reducing malfunctions and increasing production time in December of last year and January of this year. For example, the unreasonable use of electric motors and the failure to properly inspect and repair the lines for many years, and the fact that the silt in the backwater pool of the medium-sized rolling mill had not been dredged for many years, were largely resolved during the large-scale inspection. 2. Various systems have been established and improved, and workers consciously abide by labor discipline. After the large-scale inspection movement, the department established a shift handover system, a responsibility system, a regular inspection system, and a shift report system, and improved the daily report system and the badge box system. With the establishment of these systems, all work entered a regular state. Workers and staff were able to be truly responsible and abide by the rules, greatly improving work efficiency. For example, in the past, it took three days to calculate wages. After the establishment of the responsibility system, it could be calculated and issued to workers on the same day. In the past, workers on different shifts did not communicate with each other, and the workers on the next shift did not understand the work situation of the previous shift, which greatly affected production. After the establishment of the shift handover system, shifts were timed, and the situation was jointly inspected during the handover to clarify responsibilities. 3. Organize production teams to compete with each other. For example, Wei Desheng, the leader of the small group C, and all his co-workers, increased the daily output by 50 percent in the competition to become a model group, creating the highest record for rolling 8mm wire. After the small groups A and B proposed to compete with group C, the daily output also increased by 20 percent. 4. The work of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League closely cooperated and focused on production. The labor union organized twenty-one groups according to the nature of production, and the labor union committee members led the groups separately, specifically organizing and mobilizing according to the current production tasks. The Communist Youth League also made a division of labor according to the nature of production, focusing on mobilizing young workers to actively engage in production. Organizational work was carried out in leading production.

### 西北钢铁公司轧钢部  再创生产新纪录  超过日寇侵占时期百分之八十四

　　西北钢铁公司轧钢部
    再创生产新纪录
    超过日寇侵占时期百分之八十四
    【本报讯】据山西日报消息：太原西北钢铁公司轧钢部，继去年十二月份超过生产任务百分之十八，创造了首次生产新纪录后，在全体工人、工程师、职员的加倍努力下，今年一月份又超过生产任务的百分之三十，再次创造生产新纪录。此次新纪录，超过一九四三年四月日寇侵占时期的最高产量百分之八十四，超过一九四八年十一月阎匪统治时的最高产量百分之七十三。
    取得以上成绩，有下列几种原因：一、轧钢部在去年十一月下旬和十二月上旬曾发动全体职工，开展大检查运动，发现并解决了许多关于机器修理及安全设备上的问题，使去年十二月份及今年一月份故障减少，生产时间增多。如过去电动机使用不合理，线路多年没有很好检查修理；中型碾制之退水池内淤泥数年未淘等事件，在大检查中大部得到解决。二、建立和健全了各种制度，工人自觉遵守劳动纪律。该部在大查运动后，建立了交接班制、专责制、定期检查制，班报制，并健全了日报制、牌箱制。由于这些制度的订立，全部工作乃进入正规。工人职员都能确实负责和遵守，使工作效率大为提高。如过去发工资需三天时间才能算好。专责制建立之后，当日即可算好发给工人。过去换班时上下班工人互不接头，下一班工人不了解上一班工作情况，影响生产很大。交接班制度建立后，上下班定时，交接时共同检查情况，分明责任。三、组织生产小组互相竞赛。如小型丙组组长魏德生和全体工友，在发动竞赛争取模范组中，日产量增加了百分之五十，创造了碾八厘线材的最高纪录。小型甲乙两组提出和丙组竞赛后，日产量亦增加了百分之二十。四、党、政、工、团的工作紧密配合，面向生产。工会按生产性质编了二十一个小组，工会委员分头领导各小组，根据当前生产任务具体组织动员。青年团亦按生产性质作了分工，有重点的发动青年工人积极生产。在领导生产中开展组织工作。
