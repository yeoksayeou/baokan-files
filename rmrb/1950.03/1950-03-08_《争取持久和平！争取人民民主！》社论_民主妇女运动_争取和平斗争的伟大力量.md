Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th – The journal *For Lasting Peace! For People's Democracy!*, published on the 3rd of this month, carried an editorial entitled "The Democratic Women's Movement - A Great Force in the Struggle for Peace." The editorial stated: "Working women of all countries, under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, will once again demonstrate on International Women's Day – March 8th – their glorious organization and their firm determination to fight for peace and against the warmongers, demonstrating their militant solidarity." The editorial then pointed out the rapid growth of the Women's International Democratic Federation since the Second World War. The Women's International Democratic Federation has become a fighting force of international democratic women representing national women's organizations in 59 countries and boasting 80 million members. The struggle of women for equality has been integrated with the struggle of all working people for peace, democracy, and socialism. Women in capitalist countries have no political rights, and they are increasingly actively participating in the common struggle of working people to fight for economic and political rights and against war and war preparations. The victory of the Chinese people has given greater encouragement to the fighting women in colonial and dependent countries. The example of women in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, North Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic, as well as the support of democratic women worldwide, is encouraging them to participate more enthusiastically in the struggle for national liberation. After pointing out the significant contributions of women in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to national construction and peace efforts, the editorial continued: The democratic women's movement is developing in all countries. The task of the Communist Parties, trade unions, and women's democratic organizations in all countries is to support and develop various new forms of women's struggle, further expand their influence and activities among the broad masses of women, and integrate their activities with those of other democratic organizations, opposing underestimation of the mass women's movement and the role of women in the struggle. The editorial concluded: "Unity is the source of strength in the people's movement." Therefore, it is necessary to expose divisive conspiracies within women's organizations, expose the slander against the Women's International Democratic Federation and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and oppose the Titoist running dogs of imperialism in order to strengthen and consolidate the unity of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

    民主妇女运动——争取和平斗争的伟大力量
    【新华社布拉格七日电】本月三日出版的《争取持久和平！争取人民民主！》发表社论，题为《民主妇女运动——争取和平斗争的伟大力量》。社论称：“国际民主妇联所领导的一切国家的劳动妇女，将于国际妇女节——三月八日再次表明她们辉煌的组织性，她们为争取和平、反对战争贩子而斗争的坚定决心，表明她们的战斗团结。”社论继而指出第二次世界大战以来国际民主妇女运动的迅速增涨。国际民主妇联已成为代表五十九国的全国性妇女组织，和拥有八千万会员的国际民主妇女战斗团结的队伍。妇女争取平等的斗争，已与一切劳动人民为和平、民主与社会主义而进行的斗争结合起来。资本主义国家的妇女没有政治权利，她们正越来越积极地参加劳动人民的共同斗争，争取经济与政治的权利，反对战争及战争准备。中国人民的胜利，给了殖民地和附属国中的战斗妇女们以更大的鼓舞。苏联、中华人民共和国、北朝鲜、蒙古人民共和国妇女的范例以及全世界民主妇女的支持，鼓舞着她们越来越踊跃地参加民族解放的斗争。社论在指出苏联和人民民主国家的妇女对建设国家及和平事业的重大贡献后，继称：民主妇女运动正在一切国家发展，各国共产党，工会和妇女民主组织的任务，就是支持和发展妇女斗争的各种新形式，更加扩大其在广大妇女群众中的影响和活动，并将其活动与其他民主组织的活动结合起来，反对过低估计群众性妇女运动和妇女在斗争中的作用。社论最后称：“团结是人民运动中力量的泉源”，因此必须揭露妇女组织中的分裂阴谋，揭露对国际民主妇联及苏联与人民民主国家的诽谤，反对帝国主义的走狗铁托分子，以加强与巩固国际民主妇联队伍的团结。
