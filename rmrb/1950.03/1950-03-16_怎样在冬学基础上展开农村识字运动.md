How to Launch a Rural Literacy Campaign on the Basis of Winter Schools
    Li Shushen
    As of the end of January, there were 7,928 winter schools in Songjiang Province, with 502,831 students and 19,495 mass teachers (including 5,588 primary school teachers). The best winter school students have learned more than 500 characters in a month and a half to two months, the average have learned 200 to 300 characters, and the worst have learned 70 to 80 characters. Generally, they have achieved the "four abilities" - to recognize, write, recite, and use characters. Some typical examples have also been discovered and cultivated, such as the winter schools in Li Hongtun Village in Acheng and Qinghe Village in Hulin. These winter schools are not only well-run, with young adults generally learning 200 to 300 characters, but they also coordinate with and promote central work, saving cadres and the masses a lot of meeting time, and promoting the development of winter school work throughout the county.

    This year, winter schools in various regions will temporarily end in mid-March. The current task is to consolidate the existing achievements of winter schools, make the enrolled farmers persist in learning, and strive to enable all 500,000 farmers participating in winter schools to recognize 1,000 characters in 1950, eliminate this group of illiterates, and lay the foundation and prepare the conditions for a province-wide literacy campaign next year (1951).

    Now is the most critical juncture for winter schools. This is because the New Year is over, winter is coming to an end, and based on their experience of participating in winter schools in recent years, farmers have a psychological feeling that winter schools are about to stop, and their enthusiasm is not as high. At the same time, farmers are starting to prepare for spring plowing, with more things to do and less time. However, farmers have only learned 200 to 300 characters, still in the difficult stage of literacy, and have not fully mastered the basic characters, so they cannot apply them freely. Therefore, it is necessary to get through the thinking of party members, cadres, and students, make them recognize the importance of regular literacy, consolidate the existing achievements and learning enthusiasm, and eliminate their idea that "literacy is impossible during busy farming season," so as to smoothly transform winter schools into regular literacy learning. County and district leading cadres should fully support and personally take action, which is decisive.

    Secondly, village cadres and party members are the backbone of the farmers and the core of the masses. They should become pioneers of cultural construction, just as they are in production construction. Cadres must truly recognize the importance of cultural learning in their thinking, be determined to truly play a leading role, and lead the masses forward with their practical actions, truly fulfilling the responsibilities of cadres.

    Based on the experience of the winter school movement in Songjiang Province, the following three points should be noted to do a good job in the literacy movement:

    First, literacy must be combined with mass production movements, mass living needs, or central rural work. Teach what is needed in production and life; teach what is most urgently needed first; learn to apply what you learn, and be consistent in learning and application. In terms of time, we must be good at using production gaps and be good at combining with production. The dispersion and concentration of learning organizations and learning forms should also be adapted to production, and changes should be made flexibly according to the situation. Otherwise, learning cannot be consolidated, and it can never be sustained.

    Second, implement the principle of conscious voluntarism, clear up the thinking of the masses, eliminate concerns, enlighten them on the importance of literacy, and establish the idea of long-term learning. For the masses with low awareness and a relatively backward understanding of literacy, patient publicity, encouragement, and persuasion should be carried out; do not be overly hasty. As long as achievements are made and the masses truly learn something, those who do not come now will participate later.

    Third, mobilize the farmers to educate themselves, resolutely implement the policy of "teaching by the people," cultivate a large number of mass teachers in a planned and targeted manner, organize a cultural army, and embody the mass line of the literacy movement.

    At the same time, leaders must focus on key points and be good at discovering and cultivating typical examples, summarizing experiences, and gradually promoting overall work. Establish strongholds (cultural stations or general stations), and take the strongholds as the center, spreading out in a radiating and stable manner with positions. The stronghold is to choose a village or a suitable place in a district where the masses can read, read newspapers, and read books; where they can carry out recreational activities; where they can know the major events of the whole village, the whole district, the whole county, the whole province, the country, and the world, and where the masses can easily go, can attract the masses, and the masses are willing to go.

    The teaching enthusiasm of most mass teachers is very high, but they are troubled by their low level of education and lack of teaching methods. We must provide assistance in many ways in response to their difficulties. The methods of assistance and the experience of various places in Songjiang are: (1) Short-term centralized training at the district or county level. (2) Mobilize primary school teachers to help mass teachers collectively prepare lessons in a planned and regular manner, study what to teach, how to teach, what errors to prevent, etc. (3) Regularly hold teaching research conferences to study and solve problems in teaching and summarize experiences and lessons. (4) Hold teaching exhibitions. (5) Organize observation and teaching or typical report meetings to exchange experiences and inspire their enthusiasm and creativity in their work. (6) When conditions permit, regular spare-time schools for farmers can be set up, and long-term and clear teaching goals can be formulated to help them improve their cultural level in a step-by-step and substantive manner.

    In order to consolidate learning enthusiasm, cities and counties should hold grand award ceremonies for winter school models at the end of the winter school before spring plowing, summarize this stage of literacy learning, introduce and exchange experiences, commend model deeds (model students, model classes, groups, model villages, model teachers), and mobilize and deploy the work of turning winter schools into literacy schools. The meeting should be grand and create an atmosphere among the attendees that being a mass teacher is honorable.

    In addition, people with a considerable level of education and all forces that may play a certain role in this work should be organized into a cultural army. Implement the slogan "One literate person teaches one illiterate person." To make literacy closely integrated with production and life, learning can be carried out on the kang, in the fields, on the streets, next to the stove, in the cattle and horse sheds, when going to market to buy things, when going to the city to do things, when going up the mountain to pull wood, when going down to the ground to cut grass, and when threshing; learning can be carried out during spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvest, and no matter whether it is windy or rainy. Everyone should learn at least two characters a day, and the arduous task of eliminating 500,000 illiterates in 1950 will definitely be accomplished.

　　怎样在冬学基础上展开农村识字运动
    李曙森
    截至一月底止，松江全省共有冬学七、九二八处，学员五○二、八三一人，群众教师一九、四九五人（内小学教员五、五八八人）。最好的冬学学员在一个半月到两个月的时间内，已认识五百多字，一般的认识了二百到三百字，最差的也认识七八十字。一般的都作到了四会——会认、会写、会念、会用。也发现与培养了一些典型，如阿城之李洪屯与虎林之清和村等地的冬学，不但办得好，参加冬学的青壮年普遍认识了二三百字，而且冬学配合与推动了中心工作，节省了干部及群众很多的会议时间，并推动了全县冬学工作的开展。
    今年各地冬学到三月中旬即将暂告结束。当前的任务，是把冬学已有成绩巩固住，把已入学的农民使他们坚持的学下去，争取一九五○年内，使全省参加冬学的五十万农民都达到认识一千字，消灭这五十万文盲，为明年（一九五一年）的全省规模的识字运动，打下基础，准备好条件。
    目前是冬学最紧要关头。这是因为现在年关已过，冬季将终，农民根据几年来参加冬学的经验，心理上已存在着冬学快停止了的想法，劲头已不大。同时农民开始着手春耕准备工作，事情更多，时间更少。而农民现在还只认识了二三百字，还在识字的困难阶段，没有完全掌握基本文字，不能应用自如。因此，应打通党员、干部、学员思想，使他们认识经常性识字的重要，巩固住既得成绩与学习情绪，消除他们“农忙不能识字”的想法，才能顺利的把冬学转入经常性的识字学习。而县区领导干部则应全力支持，亲自下手，这是有决定性的作用的。
    其次，村屯干部党员是农民的骨干，群众的核心。应该如在生产建设中一样，成为文化建设的先锋。干部要在思想上真正认识文化学习的重要，下决心真正的起带头作用，用自己的实际行动带领群众前进，名符其实的担负起干部的责任。
    根据松江省冬学运动中的经验，要搞好识字运动，应注意下列三点：
    第一、识字必须与群众生产运动、群众生活需要或农村中心工作相结合。生产中生活中需要什么，就教什么；最迫切需要什么，就先教什么；学以致用，学用一致。时间上须善于利用生产空隙，善于与生产结合。学习组织、学习形式的分散与集中亦要与生产相适应，根据情况灵活变化。否则学习不能巩固，也决不能坚持下去。
    第二、贯彻自觉自愿原则，打通群众思想，消除顾虑，启发认识识字的重要性，树立起长期学习的思想。对觉悟不高对识字的认识较落后的群众，应耐心的进行宣传鼓励，说服教育；不要犯急性病。只要作出成绩，群众真正学到东西，现在不来的，以后也会来参加的。
    第三、发动农民自己教育自己，坚决执行“以民教民”的方针，有计划、有目标的培养大批群众教师，组织文化大军，体现识字运动的群众路线。
    同时，领导上必须有重点且要善于发现与培养典型，总结经验，逐渐推动全面工作。并建立据点（文化站或总站），以据点为中心，辐射形的稳步的有阵地的向四外展开。据点就是选择一个村或一个区的一个适当场所，群众可以在那里识字、看报、看书；可以在那里进行文娱活动；可以在那里知道全村全区全县全省国家大事，世界大事，而且群众便于到那里去，可吸引群众，群众也愿意去。
    多数群众教师的教学热情很高，但苦于文化程度低，教学上缺乏办法。我们必须针对其困难多方予以帮助。帮助的办法、松江各地的经验是：（一）以区或县为单位短期集训。（二）发动小学教师有计划的定期的帮助群众教师集体备课，研究教什么，如何教，要防止什么错误等。（三）定期召开教学研究会，研究与解决教学中的问题，总结经验教训。（四）召开教学展览会。（五）组织观摩教学或典型报告会，以交流经验，启发其对工作的积极性与创造性。（六）有条件时，可办农民正规业余学校，制订长期的明确的教学目标，有步骤有内容的帮助他们提高文化水平。
    为了巩固学习情绪，各市县应在春耕前冬学结束时，召开隆重的奖励冬学模范大会，总结这一段识字学习，介绍与交流经验，表扬模范事迹（模范学员、模范班、组、模范村、模范教师），并动员与布置将冬学变为识字学校的工作。会应开得隆重些，要在到会的人中间造成担任群众教师是光荣的气氛。
    此外，要把农民中有相当文化程度的人及一切可能在这一工作中发挥一定作用的力量，都组织起来，成为一支文化大军。贯彻“一个识字的人教会一个不识字的人”的口号。作到识字与生产和生活密切结合，不论炕头、地头、街头、灶火旁边，牛马棚里，赶集买东西，入城办事，上山拉木头、下地割草，打场；不论春耕夏锄秋收，刮风下雨都能进行学习，每个人每天都要作到至少识两个字，则一九五○年消灭五十万文盲这一艰巨任务一定可以完成。
        一九五○年二月十日
