　　To Help the Government Overcome Financial Difficulties
    Lian Buyu, a Doctor at Shanxi Medical Institute, Donates His Full Year's Technical Allowance

To the Editorial Comrades:

    The Central People's Government has pointed out that this year our country still faces considerable financial difficulties. Furthermore, many areas are suffering from drought and floods. These are clearly obstacles in our victory process. In order to completely eliminate the remnants of the reactionary bandit Chiang Kai-shek's gang as soon as possible, I am willing to donate my entire year's technical allowance to the state during this technical allowance evaluation. We must recognize the people's immediate difficulties and hardships. Moreover, our skills were acquired through the people's blood and sweat providing us with food, clothing, and learning conditions, as well as the training from the Communist Party and the People's Government. Even without the technical allowance, we should continuously strive to improve our skills. I have also noticed that some comrades, due to having substantial technical allowances, tend to be wasteful in their lives compared to the average person. They haven't seen that many people are still unable to eat well, even lacking coarse grains. Therefore, I hope everyone can economize on clothing and food, always think of the people, vigorously support the front lines, and jointly overcome difficulties to move towards production and construction. A slight reduction in our individual enjoyment can significantly alleviate the difficulties of the country and the people. Therefore, I hope everyone will respond to the government's call, produce and economize, overcome difficulties, and overcome unnecessary waste and excessive demands in life, and strive together to complete the victory of our Liberation War and the task of production and construction.

Shanxi Province Cadre Sanatorium
      Lian Buyu

Editor's Note: Comrade Lian Buyu comes from a poor peasant family in Qin Yuan County, Shanxi Province. He is thirty-seven years old, joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1946, and is currently working as a doctor at the sanatorium affiliated with the Shanxi Provincial Health Department. He joined the revolutionary work in October 1938, working as a nurse in a military hospital. Under the cultivation of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, he studied hard and became a doctor. At the beginning of this year, the hospital assessed his technical allowance to be 60 catties of millet per month, totaling 720 catties for the whole year. In order to alleviate the state's financial difficulties, he decided to hand over the entire amount to the public. Comrade Lian's family's economic situation is currently still quite difficult, with only 25 mu of land for a family of fifteen, and the house was completely burned down by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. Under such difficult circumstances, he could have chosen not to donate his due technical allowance, but he himself firmly insisted on donating his entire year's technical allowance to the country; this kind of love for the motherland and the people is extremely valuable.

　　帮助政府克服财政困难
    山西医疗院医生连步裕献出全年技术津贴编辑同志：
    中央人民政府提出，今年我们全国在财政上还有不少的困难。并且又有许多地方闹旱灾水灾。这在我们的胜利过程中，显然是一些阻碍。为了早日把反动派蒋贼介石匪帮的残余完全消灭干净，我自己在这次评定技术津贴时，愿意将全年的技术津贴全部捐献国家。我们要认识人民的切身困难与艰苦。再者，我们的技术也是靠人民以血汗供给我们衣食和学习条件加以共产党和人民政府的培养才得来的。就是没有技术津贴，我们也应该不断努力提高技术。我还看到一些同志，因为有相当的技术津贴，所以在生活上比较一般人就有些浪费。他们没有看到人民连糠菜都吃不好的还是不少。所以我希望大家能俭衣节食，处处为人民着想，大量地支援前线，共同克服困难，走向生产建设。我们每个人享受稍减低一些，即可使国家人民减少很多困难。所以希望大家响应政府号召，生产节约，克服困难，克服不应有的浪费与生活中的过高要求，为了共同努力来完成我们的解放战争的胜利与生产建设任务而奋斗。山西省干部疗养院
      连步裕
    编者按：连步裕同志出身贫农，山西沁源县人，现年三十七岁，一九四六年加入中国共产党，现在在山西省卫生厅所属疗养院作医生。他从一九三八年十月参加革命工作，在军医院作看护员，在共产党和人民解放军的培养下，努力学习，成为医生。今年年初医院中评定他的技术津贴为每月六十斤小米，全年七百二十斤，他为了减轻国家财政困难，决定全数交公。连同志家庭经济情况目前还是相当艰苦的，全家十五口人只二十五亩地，房子在抗日战争时期全被日寇烧光。他在这样困难的情况下，本来可以不必把他自己应得的技术津贴捐献出来，但是他本人坚决要把全年技术津贴捐献国家；这种对祖国和人民的热爱是十分可贵的。
