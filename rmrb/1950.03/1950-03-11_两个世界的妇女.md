Women in Two Worlds

    Soviet Women

    Soviet women are active builders of communist society.

    Soviet women account for 47 percent of all workers in the national economy. The number of women working as industrial leaders, engineers, and technicians has reached 280,000. Among collective farm women, 250,000 lead tractor teams and operate combine harvesters and tractors. Approximately 15,000 serve as chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of collective farms. In the agricultural field, about 700 women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for their outstanding achievements.

    Women account for 44 percent of experts with higher education in the Soviet Union. More than 250 Soviet women have been awarded the Stalin Prize.

    Soviet women participate in state administration on an equal footing with men. Two hundred and seventy-seven daughters of the Soviet people have been elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, more than 1,700 women have served as representatives to the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, and nearly 500,000 women have served as representatives to local Soviets.

    The exploits of Soviet women during the Great Patriotic War are immortal. Sixty-nine women have been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for their meritorious service in combat.

    In the Soviet Union, mothers are shown honor and respect everywhere. Twenty-eight thousand five hundred people have been awarded the honorary title of "Heroine Mother."

    In Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States (American Dispatch)

    One cold winter morning. The biting cold wind forced pedestrians to quicken their pace and pull up their collars. A person lay on the steps in front of a house, covered with a sheet. Pedestrians listened carefully, and in the howling wind they could hear the faint cries of a child: under the sheet was a weak young woman, beside her a newborn baby wriggling. In this day and age, such an unbelievable thing actually happened in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States.

    How did this happen? When this young woman felt she was about to give birth, she went to a nearby hospital, but they refused to help her because she was black, so only a few hospitals with special wards for black people could take her in. Here, they would not give her any help even if she died. It was too late to go to the designated place, so the unfortunate woman gave birth on the hospital steps. All the "help" she received was a sheet, which she used to lie on the stone steps.

    苏联的妇女

    在苏联对于作母亲的妇女处处表示着荣耀与尊敬。有二万八千五百人获得了“母亲英雄”的光荣称号。
    在美国首都华盛顿（美国通讯）
    一个寒冷的冬天的早晨。刺骨的寒风吹得行人不得不加快了脚步和拉起衣领来。在一所房子门口的台阶上躺着一个人，身上盖着被单。行人侧耳细听，在寒风呼啸中就可以听到微弱的小孩的哭声：被单下面是一位软弱无力的年青女人，她身旁是一个刚刚生下来的婴儿在乱动着。现在的时代，在美国首都华盛顿竟有这样难以令人相信的事情。
    这是怎样发生的呢？这位年青的女人感觉快要临产的时候，就到附近医院去的，但是这里拒绝了对她的帮助，因为这女人是黑种人，所以只有给黑人设有特别病房的少数医院才能收留。在这里，既使她死掉了也不会给她任何帮助的。到指定的地方已经来不及了，于是这个不幸的女人就在医院的门槛上生产了。对于她的全部的“帮助”只是给了她一条被单，她就利用它躺在石阶上。
