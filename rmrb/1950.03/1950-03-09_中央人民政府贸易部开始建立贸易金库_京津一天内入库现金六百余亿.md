　　The Central People's Government Ministry of Trade Begins Establishing Trade Treasury
    Over 60 Billion Yuan in Cash Deposited in Beijing and Tianjin in One Day
    [This Newspaper reports] The Beijing and Tianjin Trade Treasuries, under the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade, have been established, and the deposits of various specialized companies in the two cities have been successively deposited into the treasury. Since the State Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work was announced, in order to implement the regulation that "the cash obtained daily by state-owned trading agencies must be handed over to the national treasury on a daily basis," the Ministry of Trade, after days of consultation with the People's Bank of China, jointly stipulated a contract for the People's Bank of China to act as the agent for the Trade Treasury. Furthermore, a joint order to implement the Trade Treasury contract was jointly issued with the People's Bank of China, deciding that the Trade Treasury system would first be implemented in the four major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan. The Ministry of Trade dispatched Wang Wenbo, Director of the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Trade, and Zhou Kangmin, Manager of the China National Food Corporation, to Shanghai and Wuhan on March 3rd to convey instructions, make arrangements, and supervise the establishment of Trade Treasury work. Sha Qianli, Deputy Minister of Trade, and Yao Yilin convened meetings in Beijing and Tianjin respectively with the directors of the municipal commercial bureaus and managers of state-owned specialized companies to convey instructions and arrange for the establishment of the Trade Treasury.
    The Trade Treasuries in Beijing and Tianjin were established on March 7th. On the evening of the 6th, all deposits from specialized companies in Beijing and Tianjin had been deposited into the treasury. At the same time, the Ministry of Trade issued its first payment order, releasing the cash statistics report from the Finance Department of the Ministry of Trade: On March 6th, cash deposited by specialized companies in Beijing totaled 7.576 billion yuan (with an additional 3.537 billion yuan in the process of being deposited), and cash deposited by specialized companies in Tianjin totaled 54 billion yuan. On March 7th, 7 billion yuan was paid out in cash in Beijing, and 35 billion yuan was paid out in Tianjin, leaving a remaining cash balance of 19.576 billion yuan. The Ministry of Trade is preparing to hand over the remaining cash to the national treasury according to the ministry's financial plan, in order to fulfill the fiscal tasks that the Ministry of Trade was assigned by the National Financial Conference in February of this year.
    Based on the cash deposit situation of specialized companies in Beijing and Tianjin on March 6th and 7th, it proves that the methods stipulated in the State Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work are practically feasible. However, it also exposes the serious shortcomings of various state-owned specialized companies in their business plans and financial plans in the past. Because in the past, various specialized companies held a batch of cash in their own hands for turnover, they often did not pay much attention when formulating business plans and financial plans, so these plans were not completely in line with actual business. Now that the daily sales cash is deposited into the national treasury, and cash must be withdrawn from the Central Ministry of Trade according to the financial plan, the specialized companies are saying that their past business plans and financial plans are not completely in line with reality, and they are requesting revisions one after another. The Ministry of Trade has now decided that the March business plans and financial plans of specialized companies in Beijing and Tianjin must be revised and submitted to the ministry for review by March 10th. It has also decided to convene a meeting of the directors of the commercial departments and managers of specialized companies from Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces in Shijiazhuang on March 9th; and to convene a meeting of the directors of the commercial departments and managers of specialized companies from Suiyuan and Chahar provinces in Zhangjiakou. Based on the experience of establishing the Trade Treasury in Beijing and Tianjin, the work of establishing the Trade Treasury in the five provinces of North China will be conveyed and arranged.

　　中央人民政府贸易部开始建立贸易金库
    京津一天内入库现金六百余亿
    【本报讯】中央人民政府贸易部所属京、津两市贸易金库业已成立，该两市各专业公司存款已先后入库。自政务院统一国家财政经济工作的决定公布后，贸易部为了执行“国营贸易机关每日售得的现金，必须逐日解缴国库”的规定，经连日与中国人民银行协商结果，共同规定了由中国人民银行代理贸易金库的合同。并且与人民银行共同发布了实施贸易金库合同的联合命令，决定贸易金库制度首先在北京、天津、上海、武汉四大城市实行。并派贸易部国外贸易司司长王文波、中国粮食总公司经理周康民于三月三日分赴上海、武汉传达布置并监督建立贸易金库工作，并由贸易部副部长沙千里、姚依林在北京、天津分别召集市商业局局长及国营专业公司经理会议，传达与布置建立贸易金库的工作。
    北京、天津两市之贸易金库已于三月七日起成立。六日晚，京、津所有各专业公司存款均已入库。同时由中央贸易部以第一号支付命令发出贸易部财务处现金统计报告：三月六日北京各专业公司入库现金共七十五亿七千六百万元（另外三十五亿三千七百万元正办入库手续中），天津各专业公司入库现金共五百四十亿元。三月七日北京支付现金七十亿元，天津支付现金三百五十亿元，剩余现金一九五亿七千六百余万元。贸易部正准备将剩余现金根据该部财务计划解缴国库，以执行本年二月全国财政会议决定贸易部应上缴的财政任务。
    根据三月六日、七日北京、天津各专业公司现金缴库情况，证明政务院统一国家财政经济工作的决定中所规定的办法是实际可行的。但同时亦暴露了过去各国营专业公司在业务计划和财务计划上的严重缺点。由于过去各专业公司都掌握了一批现金在自己手里周转，因此在制订业务计划和财务计划时，往往不很注意，因此这些计划与实际业务并不完全切合。现在每日售货现金存入国库，必须按财务计划向中央贸易部领取现金的时候，各专业公司才表示过去的业务计划和财务计划不完全切合实际，纷纷要求修订。贸易部现已决定京、津两地各专业公司三月份业务计划与财务计划限于三月十日以前修订完竣，送部审核。并决定于三月九日在石家庄召集河北、平原、山西三省商业厅厅长及各专业公司经理会议；在张家口召集绥远、察哈尔两省商业厅厅长与各专业公司经理会议。根据在京、津建立贸易金库的经验，传达布置在华北五省建立贸易金库的工作。
