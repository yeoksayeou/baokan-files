　　Cooperatives Must Pay Taxes According to the Law!
　　Dalian Discovers Fifteen Cooperatives Evading Over 9 Million Kwantung Currency in Taxes Over Six Months
　　[Our Newspaper] Dalian Tax Bureau, in inspecting income tax for the second half of 1949, discovered that many cooperatives had evaded taxes. According to preliminary statistics from the city's Tax Bureau, a total of fifteen cooperatives evaded taxes, underreporting business revenue totaling 299,935,500+ yuan (Kwantung currency, same below), thus evading tax of 9,099,800+ yuan. The Lüda Police Soldier Cooperative evaded the most taxes, underreporting business revenue of over 110 million yuan, evading taxes of over 5,258,000 yuan. Other cooperatives, such as the Jianxin Workers' Cooperative, Lüda Workers' Cooperative, Yuandian Workers' Cooperative, and Sanhao Cooperative, also evaded significant taxes. The reason these cooperatives knowingly violated the law, as pointed out in a short commentary in the Lüda People's Daily on this issue, is: it’s not that the cooperatives don't understand the government's tax policy, but rather it is due to the departmentalism and anarchistic, unorganized thinking of some cadres. They mistakenly believe that the state's policies are for the people to abide by, and that they are "public servants" and don't have to abide by them. For example, the Lüda Police Soldier Cooperative usually sells grain, cooking oil, mechanical oil, and cloth, etc., and believes that these are things being sold on behalf of the public, and do not need to pay taxes. Therefore, they did not report or pay taxes for half a year. Another example is when the manager of the Jianxin Cooperative said to the tax officials when they went to check taxes: "You shouldn't be so strict with cooperatives. Aren't today's cooperatives the same as the government? What's there to check?" The Yuandian Cooperative knew that tax evasion was wrong, but when tax officials went to the manager to discuss tax issues, the manager sat in the room and refused to meet them four times. The Sanhao Cooperative delayed for excuses and has not paid taxes to this day. Because the cadres of these cooperatives have such erroneous ideological styles, they directly hinder the progress of tax work and affect national fiscal revenue.

　　合作社应一律照章纳税！
    大连市发现十五个合作社半年漏税九百余万关东币
    【本报讯】大连市税务局在检查一九四九年下半期所得税中，发现许多合作社有脱漏税款现象。据该市税务局初步统计，脱漏税款的合作社共有十五家，漏报营业金额共达二亿九千九百九十三万五千余元（关东币、下同），计逃脱应征税额九百零九万九千八百余元。其中以旅大警士合作社漏税最多，漏报营业金额达一亿一千多万元，逃税五百二十五万八千多元。其他如建新职工合作社、旅大职工合作社、远电职工合作社、三好合作社等均漏税不少。这些合作社之所以知法犯法，正如旅大人民日报关于此项问题的短评所指出：并非合作社不懂得政府的税收政策，而是由于部分干部的本位主义思想和无政府无组织思想作祟。错误地认为国家的政策是要人民来遵守的，自己是“公家人”，可以不遵守。例如旅大警士合作社，平常在卖粮食、食油、机械用油及布匹等，就认为这是给公家代卖的东西，不用纳税。因此竟漏税半年不报。又如建新合作社经理在税收人员去查税时说：“对合作社不应该这样严。今天的合作社还不是和政府的一样？还查什么”？远电合作社明知漏税不对，但税收人员去找经理研究纳税问题时，经理则坐在屋里四次不予接见。三好合作社借故拖延，至今仍未纳税。由于这些合作社干部存在着这种错误的思想作风，因而直接阻碍了税收工作的进行，影响国家财政收入。
