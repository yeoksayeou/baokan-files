Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: Comprehensive TASS news: The movements of the people in Italy, Germany, Austria, and Belgium against American imperialist military aid and in support of peace are continuing to expand.

　　In Italy, dockworkers in the ports of Venice, Bari, Brindisi, Grande, and Taranto, as well as railway workers in Bologna and Verona, have successively and solemnly sworn not to load or transport American war materials. Roman youth have also held demonstrations protesting the military obligations undertaken by the Gasperi government in the North Atlantic Treaty. Demonstrators wrote slogans such as "Jacobs (US Military Aid Representative in Italy) get out of Italy!" and "Down with war!" on sidewalks and walls.

　　In West Germany, despite the suppression by the American and British occupation authorities, dockworkers in Duisburg and other cities in the Ruhr region also passed a resolution at their annual meeting in February, supporting the decisions of their foreign brothers and refusing to load or unload munitions and military supplies. The city of Düsseldorf in the British occupation zone recently held a meeting attended by representatives of non-party groups and industry, establishing a Peace Committee and proposing the task of carrying out a peace movement among the people and opposing preparations for war in West Germany. Peace committees have also been established in Hanover in the British occupation zone and Heilbronn in the American occupation zone.

　　In Austria, the Presidium of the Free Austrian Youth League held a special meeting to discuss the peace movement and formulate the urgent tasks of Austrian youth in the struggle for peace. The municipal council of Bodenstein in Lower Austria passed a resolution at its recent meeting strongly protesting the arms race. The city also established a peace committee representing people from all walks of life.

　　In Belgium, when the Ministry of Defense Propaganda Office issued a letter to unemployed youth in major industrial centers throughout the country, calling on them to join the army, the youth of Liège replied: "We will not die for the merchants of cannons. We were born to live in peace, and we will fight for peace."

    【新华社北京三日电】综合塔斯社消息：意、德、奥、比四国人民反对美帝国主义军事援助与拥护和平的运动，正继续扩大中。
    在意大利，威尼斯、巴利、布林的西、大兰多等港的码头工人，与波伦亚与未罗那城的铁路工人，均先后庄严宣誓，决不起卸或载运美国的战争物资。罗马青年亦曾举行示威，抗议加斯贝利政府在北大西洋公约中承担的军事义务。示威者在人行道上和墙上写着：“雅各（美驻意军援代表）滚出意大利！”“打倒战争！”等标语。
    在西德，不顾美英占领当局的镇压，杜伊斯堡与鲁尔区其他城市的码头工人，在二月举行的年会上也通过决议，拥护外国弟兄们的决定，拒绝起卸军火和军事物资。英占区的杜塞尔多夫城，最近曾举行非党团体与工业界代表参加的会议，成立了拥护和平委员会，并提出了在人民中间开展和平运动及反对在西德备战的任务。英占区的汉诺威与美占区的海尔布隆，也都成立了和平委员会。
    在奥国，自由奥地利青年团主席团举行特别会议，专门讨论和平运动，并制定了奥国青年在争取和平斗争中的迫切任务。下奥地利波登斯泰恩的市政委员会，在最近举行的会议中通过决议，强力抗议军备竞赛。该市并成立了代表各阶层人民的和平委员会。
    在比利时，当国防部宣传处发出告全国各大工业中心的失业青年书，号召他们参军时，列日城的青年们答复说：“我们不为大炮商人去送死，我们生来是要过和平生活的，我们要为和平而斗争。”
