Xinhua News Agency, March 13th:

An ambitious plan for a nationwide grain adjustment is being progressively implemented. This arduous task, unprecedented in China's grain history, will ensure the balance of grain supply and demand in major cities and disaster areas across the country, and maintain a reasonable parity ratio between cotton and grain in cotton-producing areas. At the same time, it will be sufficient to reduce foreign grain imports to a minimum, to counter enemy blockade and create a more favorable situation for us in foreign trade. In the years before the War of Resistance Against Japan, foreign grain imports reached a maximum of 4 billion catties per year, and a minimum of over 400 million catties per year. Huge amounts of foreign grain imports consumed a large amount of China's foreign exchange. Existing simultaneously with this situation was the phenomenon that in many grain-producing areas, large quantities of surplus grain could not find a market, resulting in low grain prices hurting farmers. One of the important reasons for this was the lack of nationwide overall planning and coordination.

Such overall planning and coordination is only possible today on the basis of such national unity. Last winter, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government held a national grain conference, deciding that all public grain collected in various parts of the country, except for local surcharges, would be uniformly allocated by the Central Ministry of Finance. At the same time, it was decided that all remaining public grain, after deducting military grain and other necessary expenditures, would be handed over to the Central Ministry of Trade to regulate the market. This batch of grain is huge in quantity, accounting for the major part of the country's market commodity grain. As long as it can be used rationally and in a planned way, state-owned grain companies will have sufficient power to lead private grain merchants and solve the national grain supply problem. The Ministry of Trade has also twice convened responsible persons from various regions across the country to hold long meetings, carefully calculating the grain production and sales quantities in various regions, formulating an overall plan, uniformly transferring surplus grain from various producing areas, and separately allocating it to various sales areas. Such rational allocation is undoubtedly beneficial to the interests of various grain-deficient regions, and at the same time beneficial to various grain-surplus regions. Because in the situation where the mainland has been basically completely liberated and the country has been basically unified, no region can close its doors and stabilize its economy alone. If the price of goods in any region fluctuates due to grain shortage, it will quickly affect the whole country.

According to the Ministry of Trade's careful calculations at these two meetings: This year, the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Central South, and Southwest administrative regions have a large surplus of grain in addition to their own military and civilian food needs, which is sufficient to basically solve the needs of various grain-deficient regions. Therefore, this plan decided: the shortfall in North China will be adjusted by part of the surplus grain from the Northeast and all of the surplus grain from Inner Mongolia; East China, including Shanghai, has the largest grain shortage, which will be supplied by another part of the Northeast and the surplus grain from Central South and Sichuan. In addition, some smaller adjustments will also be made between other regions and within each region: for example, transporting surplus grain from the Changzhi area on the western foothills of the Taihang Mountains to Handan on the eastern foothills, from the Dabie Mountains area to northern Anhui, and then from northern Anhui to Shanghai. Guangdong will receive 200 million catties of rice from Hunan and Jiangxi. Xi'an has already received 20 million catties of wheat from Henan to support a reasonable parity ratio between cotton and grain. Other transfers have also begun: 120 million catties of coarse grains from the Northeast have arrived in the disaster areas of Hebei, two-thirds of the surplus grain from Inner Mongolia has arrived in Beijing, and in addition, rice from the Northeast and both sides of the Yangtze River is being continuously transported to Shanghai.

This large-scale transfer is an extremely complex organizational task, which requires solving all kinds of problems in long-distance transportation over thousands of miles. Various means of transportation and methods, from railways and ships to animal carts and manpower, will be fully utilized. Relevant departments and local governments are actively cooperating in this work. The Ministry of Trade has long signed a contract with the Ministry of Railways, and a contract between the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Communications has also been signed. The Ministry of Communications is committed to organizing various ships on the Yangtze River. Central South and East China have separately organized grain transportation committees. In addition to the personnel of the China Grain Company and its branches in various places, Central South has temporarily transferred 3,000 other cadres to participate in this work, East China has transferred 2,000 people, and North China has transferred 400 people. The Ministry of Trade has also directly dispatched a large number of cadres to various handover locations to supervise.

In many cases, due to inconvenient transportation, the freight costs are very high, making this transfer a clearly unprofitable business. However, state-owned trade organizations resolutely took on this responsibility for the greatest benefit of regulating people's food and stabilizing prices. When formulating the operating plan for the whole year, the state-owned China Grain Company repeatedly made careful calculations, and the subsidized funds were equivalent to more than 400 million catties of millet. In addition, such a large-scale and unprecedented transfer also caused a series of technical difficulties. First of all, there are insufficient processing factories, which is one of the bad consequences of long-term reliance on foreign rice imports. To solve this difficulty, efforts will be made to increase machine processing equipment this year, but the main thing will still be to organize manual processing as much as possible. At the same time, it is also necessary to increase the construction of warehouses and implement scientific storage methods on a large scale.

During the Liberation War, tens of thousands of farmers drove their donkeys thousands of miles to deliver grain, ensuring the needs of large-scale operations by millions of troops. Last year, the transfer of grain between various regions to major cities also reached more than 500 million catties. Having grown up in continuously overcoming endless difficulties, the Chinese people will certainly create another miracle in the national grain supply work this year.

　　我国粮食史上空前艰巨工作
    全国粮食实施通盘调剂  保证供求平衡减少进口外粮
    可供调剂的余粮数量巨大，足够解决全国粮食供应问题。
    大批余粮现正源源不断运往缺粮地区
    全国各地各部门组织配合行动供应民食工作将创造出奇迹
    【新华社十三日讯】一个在全国范围内通盘调剂粮食的伟大计划正在逐步执行之中。这个艰巨的在中国粮食史上空前的工作，将保证全国各大城市和灾区粮食供求的平衡，和维持产棉区棉粮的合理比价；同时足以减少外国粮食的进口到最低限度，以还击敌人的封锁，并在对外贸易上造成对我更为有利的形势。抗战以前的几年，入口外粮最高时年达四十亿斤，最低时每年也在四亿斤以上。巨额外粮的入口，消耗了中国大量的外汇。与这种情况同时存在的是，许多产粮区有大批余粮找不到销路，形成谷贱伤农的畸形现象。重要的原因之一，是缺乏在全国范围内的通盘调度。
    这样的通盘调度，只有在今天这样的全国统一的基础之上才有可能。去年冬季中央人民政府财政部曾经举行了一次全国的粮食会议，决定全国各地所收的公粮除地方附加粮之外，全部由中央财政部统一调度；同时，决定除去军粮和其他必要的支拨外，公粮的其余部分全部交中央贸易部调剂市场。这批粮食数量巨大，占全国市场商品粮食的主要部分，只要能够有计划地予以合理使用，国营粮食公司就有充分的力量领导私营粮商，解决全国的粮食供应问题。贸易部又两次召集全国各地区的有关负责人举行长时间的会议，缜密计算了各地区粮食的产销数量，制定了通盘的计划，统一调运各个产区的余粮，分别调剂各个销区。这样的合理调剂，对各个缺粮地区的利益自不待说，同时对各个有余粮的地区也是有利的。因为在此大陆业已基本上全部解放和全国业已基本上统一的局面之下，没有一个地区能关起门来单独地稳定自己的经济；如果任何一个地区的物价因缺粮而发生波动，必将迅速地影响到全国。
    按照贸易部这两次会议的慎重计算：今年东北、内蒙、中南、西南各大行政区除了本身的军需民食之外，还有大量的余粮，足以基本上解决各个缺粮地区的需要。因此这个计划决定：华北地区所不足的，以东北余粮的一部分和内蒙余粮的全部调剂；包括上海在内的华东地区缺粮数量最大，则以东北的另一部分和中南、四川的余粮供应。此外，其他地区之间和各自内部，也将进行一些数量较小的调剂：比如把太行山西麓长治地区的余粮运到东麓的邯郸，以大别山区的运到皖北，再以皖北的运到上海，广东将从湖南和江西得到两万万斤大米，西安已经从河南得到两千万斤小麦，以支持棉粮的合理比价。其他各项调运也都已经开始：东北杂粮一亿二千万斤已到达河北灾区，内蒙余粮已有三分之二到达北京，此外，东北和长江两岸的大米正在源源不绝地向上海运去。
    这种大规模的调运是一个极其复杂的组织工作，这须要解决几千里路程的长途运输中各种各样的难题，从铁路、轮船到兽车、人力等等各种运输工具和方法都将在充分使用之列。有关部门和地方政府正在积极配合这个工作。贸易部早已和铁道部签订了合同，贸易部、交通部的合同也已签订，交通部正致力于组织长江的各种船只。中南和华东分别组织了运粮委员会，除了中国粮食公司及其各地分支公司本身的人员之外，中南临时抽调了其他的干部三千人参加这个工作，华东抽调了两千人，华北抽调了四百人。贸易部又直接派遣了大批干部到各个交接地点去进行监督。
    在许多情况下，由于交通不便，运费十分巨大，这种调运成为一种明明白白的非赔累不可的生意。但是，国营贸易机关为了调剂民食、稳定物价的最大利益，毅然负起了这个责任。国营的中国粮食公司在拟订今年全年的经营计划时曾经一再精打细算，赔贴的资金折合小米约在四亿斤以上。此外，这样规模庞大空前的调运还引起一连串技术上的困难。首先是加工的工厂不足，这正是长期倚赖洋米入口的恶果之一。为解决这一困难，今年将努力增加机器加工的设备，但是主要的还将是尽可能的组织人力加工。同时，还要大量的增建仓库和实行科学的保管方法。
    解放战争期间，成千成万的农民们赶着他们的毛驴千里送粮，保证了数百万大军大规模作战的需要。去年各地区之间调剂各大城市的粮食也曾经达到了五亿斤以上。在连续地克服无穷无尽的困难之中成长起来的中国人民，今年在全国粮食的供应工作上，一定又将要创造出奇迹来。
