　　Workers Encouraged Production and Learning Enthusiasm Through Radio Broadcasts
　　·Lai Weiliang·
　　We, from the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Tianjin Railway Administration, have broadcast on the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station several times, introducing our experiences in work and study to the city's workers. When we learned that our broadcasted experience of the "telegraph contract system" had influenced the workers of the Fourth Branch of the Second District Trade Union and helped them improve their work, we were extremely excited. This not only illustrates the great educational role played by the radio station, but also encourages our work enthusiasm. In the future, comrades in our Beijing Telegraph Office will definitely attach more importance to broadcasting work, using it to learn and absorb the work and study experiences of comrades in other factories and enterprises, and also introduce our experiences to others.

　　工人在电台广播鼓励了生产和学习热情
    ·来维良·
    我们天津铁路管理局北京电报所在北京市人民广播电台广播了好几次，向全市工人同志们介绍了我们的工作和学习中的经验。当我们知道了我们广播过的“电报包台制”的经验，对二区工会四分会的工人同志起了帮助他们改进工作的影响以后，我们更是兴奋万分。这一方面说明了广播电台所发挥的伟大教育作用，另一方面也鼓励了我们的工作热情。今后我们北京电报所的同志们，一定更重视广播工作，用它学习吸取别的工厂、企业的同志们的工作和学习经验，也把我们的经验介绍出去。
