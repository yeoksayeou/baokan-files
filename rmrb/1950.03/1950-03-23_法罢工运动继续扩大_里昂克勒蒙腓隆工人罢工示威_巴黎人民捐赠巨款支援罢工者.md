Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 17th (TASS): The strike movement of French working people demanding a monthly allowance of 3,000 francs and increased wages has persisted for twenty-three days. The scope of the strike is extremely broad, including steel, metal, machinery, textiles, construction, gas, electricity, and many other industries. Workers have won in two hundred and twelve negotiations. Regardless of the authorities' suppression, the strike movement continues to expand. Workers in the baking and food industries in several cities have gone on strike. Workers from enterprises throughout Lyon held a twenty-four-hour strike. In Clermont-Ferrand, 17,000 workers and staff held demonstrations demanding higher wages. Short strikes occurred in enterprises within the Aisne province on March 16th. The people continue to support the striking workers; residents of the 14th arrondissement of Paris have donated 700,000 francs to the strikers' relief fund. The Paris underground railway workers' union has also raised 500,000 francs to aid the striking workers at the Renault factory.
