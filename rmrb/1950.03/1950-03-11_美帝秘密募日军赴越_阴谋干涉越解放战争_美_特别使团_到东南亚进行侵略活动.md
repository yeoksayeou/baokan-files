　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th: U.S. imperialism is plotting to further interfere in the Vietnamese people's liberation movement. According to a March 4th Agence France-Presse report, American experts are "meticulously studying to formulate two plans: one is an emergency military and economic aid plan to meet the current needs of Indochina, and the other is a long-term plan." In order to carry out this despicable interference, according to a March 2nd Moscow broadcast, the United States is recruiting Japanese soldiers in Japan, preparing to send them to Indochina to fight against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. occupation authorities have established agencies in Japan to secretly recruit former Japanese officers and soldiers to establish an "expeditionary force" in preparation for deployment to Vietnam. Under MacArthur's orders, the recruited Japanese soldiers are undergoing short-term training by American instructors.

　　At the same time, negotiations between the United States and France regarding aid to the puppet Bao Dai regime, which began in early February, are still ongoing. The United States is attempting to hand over military supplies directly to Bao Dai, thereby more directly controlling Bao Dai. A Reuters Saigon dispatch stated that for the U.S. State Department's special mission headed by Griffin, "the most important thing is to consider whether this aid will go through the French government or be given directly to Bao Dai." However, the U.S. government and its French partners have differences on this point. On the day after the Griffin mission arrived in Saigon (March 7th), Agence France-Presse reporters, spokesmen for the French bourgeoisie, said that American "aid to Indochina should go through the French intermediary." An Associated Press report also quoted French Foreign Ministry sources as saying: "France has requested that France should have control over any funds from the United States to aid Indochina." Due to this disagreement, the negotiations between the United States and France regarding aid to Bao Dai have not yet reached a final agreement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th: Following a meeting of American diplomatic personnel stationed in the Far East in Bangkok, the U.S. State Department has dispatched a so-called "special mission" to Southeast Asia to engage in aggressive activities. The head of the mission is Griffin, former Deputy Director of the "Economic Cooperation Administration China Branch," who aided the Kuomintang bandit gangs in China in carrying out counter-revolutionary civil war. The mission arrived in Tokyo on the 1st, stayed for four days, and then arrived in Hong Kong on the 5th and Saigon on the 6th. It is scheduled to stay there for a week and then travel to Malaya, Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia, for a total of two months of activities in Southeast Asia.

　　According to United Press reports, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson announced on February 23rd that the mission's task is to study on-site the conditions for granting "U.S. aid" to Southeast Asian countries under Truman's so-called "Point Four Program" for developing backward areas or any "U.S. aid" plan, and to "deal separately and individually" with Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Due to the victorious development of the Vietnamese people's war of liberation, the mission is paying particular attention to considering and formulating specific measures to further interfere in Vietnam. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on February 23rd, the mission will consider providing direct arms aid to the Bao Dai government. Reuters quoted Griffin as saying that the mission's responsibility is to put forward "urgent recommendations" on aid to Bao Dai.

　　美帝秘密募日军赴越
    阴谋干涉越解放战争
    美“特别使团”到东南亚进行侵略活动
    【新华社北京十日电】美帝国主义正阴谋进一步干涉越南人民解放运动。据法新社四日消息：美国专家们正在“缜密研究，以订出两个计划，一个是适应印度支那目前需要的紧急军事与经济援助计划，一个是长期计划”。为了进行这种可耻的干涉，据莫斯科二日广播：美国正在日本征募日军，准备送至印度支那对越南民主共和国作战。美占领当局已在日本成立机构，秘密征募前日本官兵，以建立“远征兵团”，准备开赴越南。遵照麦克阿瑟的命令，被征募的日军均由美国教官进行短期训练。
    与此同时，美国和法国关于援助保大傀儡政权的谈判，自二月上旬开始以来，至今仍在进行中。美国企图把军火物资直接交给保大，从而更直接地控制保大，路透社西贡电说：对于以葛里芬为首的美国务院特别使团，“最重要的是考虑这些援助是否经过法国政府，或直接给予保大”。但在这一点上，美政府和其法国伙伴，发生了分歧。法国资产阶级代言人法新社记者在葛里芬使团抵西贡的次日（七日）即说：美国“给印度支那的援助应该经过法国的媒介”。美联社消息也引法国外交部人士称：“法国已要求美国援助印度支那的任何款项，法国应有控制权。”由于这一分歧，使美、法两国关于援助保大的谈判，迄今尚未获得最后协议。
    【新华社北京十日电】在美国驻远东外交人员于曼谷举行会议以后，美国国务院已派遣一个所谓“特别使团”来东南亚进行侵略活动。该使团团长为曾在中国援助国民党匪帮进行反革命内战的前“经济合作总署中国分署”副署长葛里芬。该使团于一日抵东京勾留四日后，于五日抵香港，六日抵西贡，预定在该地停留一周，然后转赴马来亚、缅甸、泰国及印尼，共将在东南亚进行为时两个月的活动。
    据合众社消息，美国务卿艾奇逊二月二十三日宣布该使团的任务是：就地研究在杜鲁门的所谓开发落后地区的“第四点计划”或任何“美援”计划项下给予东南亚各国“美援”的条件，并与越南、泰国和印尼“分别单独打交道”。由于越南人民解放战争的胜利发展，该使团特别注意于考虑与制订进一步干涉越南的具体措施。据合众社华盛顿二月二十三日电透露：使团将考虑以武器援助直接给予保大政府。另据路透社引葛里芬自称：使团的责任在于提出关于援助保大的“紧急建议”。
