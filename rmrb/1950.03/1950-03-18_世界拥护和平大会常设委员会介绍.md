The World Congress of Supporters of Peace, held simultaneously in Paris and Prague from April 20th to 25th, 1949, established the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. This is the leading body of international peace and democratic forces, organized on a global scale, to fight for peace. A total of 2,009 representatives from 72 countries and 10 international organizations attended the Paris and Prague conferences. 135 representatives from 49 countries, including the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as representatives from the International Union of Students and the International Organization of Journalists, were elected as members of the Standing Committee. (The second plenary meeting of the Standing Committee expelled one representative from Yugoslavia and added three new members.) The tasks of the Standing Committee are to resolutely oppose and stop all acts of aggression, oppose and defeat war propaganda, coordinate the activities of all peace forces, help them develop contacts, exchange information, and promote work.

The Standing Committee elects one chairman, nine vice-chairmen (the second plenary meeting of the Standing Committee has already added one vice-chairman), and one secretary-general to form an executive bureau. The current chairman is French atomic scientist Professor Joliot-Curie. The vice-chairmen include Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Bailleul, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Soviet writer Fadeyev, and Chinese writer Guo Moruo. The Secretary-General is the French writer Raffel. The permanent headquarters of the Standing Committee is located in Paris, and its official publication is *For Peace*, which was founded in August 1949.

The Standing Committee holds a plenary meeting every few months. During the adjournment of the plenary meeting, the executive bureau is responsible for implementing resolutions and promoting work. The first meeting of the Standing Committee was held in Paris on April 26th last year, the day after the closing of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The second meeting was held in Rome from October 28th to 31st. The third meeting is being held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, from the 15th of this month.

By the end of last year, the Standing Committee had maintained regular contact with the peace committees of 76 countries, that is, almost all countries on Earth. On October 2nd last year, at the call of the Standing Committee, demonstration movements for the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" were held in 60 countries. In December, the Standing Committee sent a telegram to the parliaments of various countries, calling for consideration of five peace proposals: stopping the arms race, banning atomic weapons, stopping colonial wars, stopping the suppression of peace supporters, and major powers concluding peace treaties. In late February of this year, the Standing Committee sent delegations to visit the parliaments of several countries to deliver appeals, requesting the acceptance of two peace proposals: universal disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons. This proposal has been warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world.

    一九四九年四月二十日至二十五日在巴黎和布拉格同时举行的世界拥护和平大会，产生了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，这是国际和平民主力量在全世界规模内组织起来的为和平而斗争的领导机构。出席巴黎和布拉格大会的，共有七十二个国家和十个国际团体的代表二千零九人，被选为常设委员会委员的，计有苏联、中国、法国、意大利、美国、英国等四十九个国家的代表以及国际学联和国际记者协会的代表共一百三十五人。（常委会第二次全体会议开除南斯拉夫代表一人，增选委员三人）常设委员会的任务是：坚决反对并制止一切侵略行为，反对并击破战争宣传；协调一切和平力量之间的活动，帮助他们发展联系，交换情报，推动工作。
    和大常委会推选主席一人，副主席九人（常委会第二次全体会议已增选副主席一人），总书记一人，组成执行局。现任主席为法国原子能科学家约里奥——居里教授，副主席有国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人、世界工联总书记赛扬、世界民主青联主席鲍埃逊、苏联作家法捷耶夫及我国作家郭沫若等人，总书记为法国作家拉斐德。常设委员会的永久总部设在巴黎，机关刊物为《拥护和平》，一九四九年八月创刊。
    和大常委会每隔数月召开全体会议一次，在全体会议闭会期间，则由执行局负责执行决议，推动工作。去年四月二十六日，即世界拥护和平大会闭幕后次日，常委会在巴黎举行第一次会议，十月二十八日至三十一日在罗马举行第二次会议。自本月十五日起，在瑞典京城斯德哥尔摩举行第三次会议。
