    People from All Walks of Life Should Unite to Supervise
    Prevent Illegal Merchants from Evading Taxes!

Editor:
    The day before yesterday, I bought a bottle of "Tiger Bone Wine" worth 50,000 yuan at the "Tongrentang Lejia Old Shop" outside Qianmen Dazhalan. The pharmacy did not voluntarily issue an invoice and affix stamps. Only after I urged them did they handle it in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, I imagine that similar incidents of failing to honestly comply with regulations by issuing invoices and affixing stamps may also exist elsewhere. Will this affect national tax revenue? Does failure to issue an invoice mean tax evasion? Can the sales proceeds be accurately recorded in the account books? I am a person who does not understand tax work. If you do not think this is a trivial matter, please forward it to the relevant tax authorities for research and consideration, and hope to awaken the awareness of tax obligations among all stores.

### 各界人民一致起来监督  不让不法商人漏税！

　　各界人民一致起来监督
    不让不法商人漏税！编辑同志：
    我前天曾在前门外大栅栏“同仁堂乐家老铺”买了一瓶“虎骨酒”，价值五万元。该药店未主动的给开发票贴印花，经我催询，才照章办理。因此我想像这类应当开发票贴印花而不老老实实照章办理的事件可能别处也有。这对于国家税收是否要有影响？不开发票是否就要漏税？卖款多少能正确的记在账本上么？我是一个不懂税务工作的人，如果你们不以为这是一件小事，就请转达有关税务部门研究考虑，并希唤起各商店注意纳税的义务观念。马秀峰
