Eradicate Weeds to Prevent Cotton Aphids
    Zhu Hongfu, Zhang Guangxue

    I. Cotton Aphids Cause Very Serious Damage

    Cotton aphids, also known as honey aphids, honey bugs, greasy bugs, ant sweat, oil sweat, oil dragons, ?, drought bugs, and ant cattle, are the most important pests of cotton in North China. They occur and cause damage almost every year. Mild infestations hinder the growth and development of cotton plants, delay the flowering period, and reduce quality and yield per mu; severe infestations cause cotton plants to die and cotton fields to be abandoned. In individual areas, due to the serious damage caused by cotton aphids, farmers have abandoned planting American cotton and switched to Chinese cotton, or even abandoned cotton planting altogether in favor of food crops.

  II. Cotton Aphids Come from Weeds

    Some villagers say that cotton aphids are hatched by ants, or that they come from "the sky," and some even say that they grow on the cotton itself. These statements are clearly wrong. Scientific experiments and investigations have shown that cotton aphids actually grow on weeds. According to our investigations in 1948 and 1949, cotton aphids on cotton plants were proven to have come from more than a dozen weeds. However, in vast cotton-growing areas (such as the cotton-growing areas of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces), the most important weed is only one type: bitter sowthistle (commonly known as bitter vegetable, swallowtail, duckling, salt lettuce, or rabbit grass). In early March (the Awakening of Insects solar term), we can find cotton aphids that have just hatched from eggs at its roots. After one or two months of breeding and propagation, by early May (the Beginning of Summer solar term), each bitter sowthistle root has an average of one to two hundred cotton aphids, most of which have developed wings. At this time, cotton seedlings have just emerged from the soil, and cotton aphids fly from bitter sowthistle to cotton seedlings in batches. Bitter sowthistle often grows on field ridges or in small patches scattered in cotton fields. Therefore, villagers often report that cotton aphids always occur first at the edges of the fields, or that the occurrence of cotton aphids depends on the soil, and many small plots of land are always the first to be infested with cotton aphids, and then spread to the entire field. This is all because bitter sowthistle grows there. Therefore, to prevent the damage of cotton aphids, we must first recognize that cotton aphids harm cotton plants by transmitting from weeds such as bitter sowthistle.

    III. Thoroughly Eradicate Weeds to Prevent Cotton Aphid Damage

    Now that we know that cotton aphids are transmitted from weeds such as bitter sowthistle, we have a method to prevent cotton aphid damage, which is to launch a mass weed removal campaign at a certain time. The most suitable time to eradicate weeds such as bitter sowthistle is twice a year: once before cotton planting, from early March to the end of April (from the Awakening of Insects to Grain Rain), when weeds such as bitter sowthistle have begun to germinate and grow, cotton aphids have already hatched and propagated, winged cotton aphids have not yet occurred in large numbers, and cotton seedlings have not yet emerged from the soil. Therefore, eradicating weeds such as bitter sowthistle by the roots and concentrating them for burning at this time, to prevent weeds from regenerating or cotton aphids from migrating, can prevent cotton aphid damage. The other time is after the cotton stalks are harvested, from early October to the end of November (from Cold Dew to Light Snow). At this time, cotton plants have withered, and most cotton aphids have gone to the roots of bitter sowthistle to lay eggs. Therefore, if you want to prevent cotton from aphid damage next year, you should eradicate weeds such as bitter sowthistle by the roots this year and concentrate them for burning. However, weed removal is a regular task. In addition to carrying out two mass weed removal campaigns a year, pay attention to regular weed removal work, to the extent that there are no weeds growing in the fields and on the ridges, and further eliminate weeds in wastelands. In weed removal, it is especially important to eradicate the roots of bitter sowthistle and concentrate them for burning, because cotton aphids or their eggs can often be found on the roots of bitter sowthistle five inches deep. Villagers report that cotton aphids always occur first in small plots of land, and the occurrence of cotton aphids can be prevented by turning the soil and moving the soil, which is exactly the effect of fundamentally eradicating bitter sowthistle.

    IV. Benefits of Preventing Cotton Aphids

    "Prevention" and "treatment" are complementary, but preventing pests is more important than treating pests, because preventing pests has many advantages compared to treating pests:

    1.  Convenience in time—As the saying goes, "Fighting for autumn harvest and rushing to harvest wheat is a chaotic flurry," and "Wheat harvest is only for a short time," indicating that harvesting wheat is like snatching wheat, and not even a moment can be delayed. However, the time to use medicine to control cotton aphids coincides with the wheat harvest, so everyone feels a sense of neglecting one for the other. If a preventive measure is adopted in advance, this conflict in time will no longer exist. Because eradicating weeds such as bitter sowthistle can be done in late autumn or early spring, not only is there much more time, but also the leisure time of farmers can be utilized.

    2.  Simplicity in procedures—When using pesticides to control aphids, various procedures are required in preparing the medicine, which is not as simple as weed removal and prevention.

    3.  No need for medicines and application tools—Preventing cotton aphids does not require any medicines or application machines, which can reduce the purchase of many medicines and machines, saving a lot of money. This is particularly meaningful in the current stage where there is a shortage of medicines and application tools, and the purchasing power of the general farmers is still very small.

    4.  Preventing aphids is like preventing disease—Preventing aphids is to do a good job in prevention before the cotton is harmed. Therefore, the cotton has not been harmed at all. Treating aphids is like treating disease. Waiting until the disease has already come upon the body before treating it, even if it is cured, the body has already suffered a great loss.

    5.  Weed removal and aphid prevention incidentally solves many problems—Eradicating weeds not only solves the problem of cotton aphid damage, but also prevents the occurrence and damage of many other pests, as well as the transmission of plant diseases. Weeds often deprive cotton plants of sunlight, moisture, and nutrients. Eradicating weeds not only prevents cotton aphid damage, but also achieves the effect of maintaining the sunlight, moisture, and nutrients that cotton needs most.

    V. What Kind of Plant is Bitter Sowthistle?

    Bitter sowthistle is called Yan'erwei (pronounced as 121) in southern Hebei, Yaya Miao in Xinxiang, and Yanjuzi in Heze. Some places also call it Tuer Cao (rabbit grass). It is a plant of the Compositae family, growing wild in fields, ridges, wastelands, graveyards, river banks, and roadsides. The leaves are long and oval, with serrated edges. The stems and leaves are very soft, and white juice flows out when broken. It blooms with light yellow flowers in spring and autumn. The roots are earthy yellow, very brittle, and often have round root nodules attached. It has perennial roots and reproduces by roots or seeds, making it a weed that is not easy to eradicate in the field.

　　铲除杂草预防棉蚜
    朱弘复·张广学
    一、棉蚜为害非常严重
    棉蚜又名蜜虫、蜜虫子、腻虫、蚁汗、油汗、油龙、油虫、?、旱虫、蚁牛，是华北棉花最重要的害虫，几乎年年发生为害，轻则阻碍棉株的生长发育，延迟收花期，减低品质与每亩产量；重则使棉株死亡，棉田废弃。个别的地区因棉蚜的严重为害，放弃种植美棉而改种中棉，甚至放弃种棉而改种粮食作物。
  二、棉蚜是从杂草上来的
    有些老乡们传说棉蚜是蚂蚁孵出来的，或说是从“天上下来的”，更有的说从棉花上自己生出来的。这些说法显然都是错误的。经过科学的试验和调查，棉蚜实际上是从杂草上生长出来的。根据我们一九四八年和一九四九年的调查，证明棉花上蚜虫是从十几种杂草上跑过来的。但是在广大棉区中（如河北、平原省两棉区），最重要的杂草只有一种，那便是苦荬菜（俗名苦麻菜，燕儿尾，鸭鸭苗，盐苣子，或免儿草）。在三月初旬间（惊蛰节），我们就可以在它的根部发现才从卵中孵出来的棉蚜，经过一两个月的繁殖和生衍，到了五月初旬（立夏节），每颗苦荬菜的根部，就平均有一二百个棉蚜了，并且大都生了翅。这时棉苗出土不久，棉蚜便一批又一批的从苦荬菜上飞到棉苗上来。苦荬菜常常生长在地埂上，或是在棉地中一小块一小块的分散生长，所以老乡们常常反映说，棉蚜老是先从地边上发生，或是说棉蚜的发生随水土，很多小块土地年年先发生棉蚜，然后才蔓延到全田。这都是因为有苦荬菜生长的缘故。所以我们要预防棉蚜的为害，首先要认清棉蚜的为害棉株，是从苦菜荬等杂草上传过来的。
    三、彻底铲除杂草预防棉蚜为害
    我们既知棉蚜是从苦荬菜等杂草上传过来的，也就得到了预防棉蚜为害的办法，那便是在一定的时间开展一个群众性的除草运动。铲除苦荬菜等杂草最适宜的时间，一年中有两次：一次是在棉花播种以前，从三月初旬到四月底（惊蛰到谷雨）的一段时间，这时苦荬菜等杂草已开始发芽生长，棉蚜业已孵化并繁殖生衍，有翅棉蚜还没有大量发生，棉苗这时也还没有出土，所以这时把苦荬菜等杂草连根铲除，并集中烧毁，免得杂草再生或棉蚜迁移，便能预防了棉蚜的为害。还有一次是在棉花秸收割以后，从十月初旬到十一月底（寒露至小雪）的一段时间。这时棉株业已枯死，大部棉蚜都到了苦荬菜的根部产卵，所以要想明年的棉花不受蚜害，今年便该把苦荬菜等杂草连根铲除集中烧毁。但铲除杂草是件经常的工作，除了开展一年两次群众性的除草运动外，要注意经常的除草工作，作到保持田间地埂没有杂草生长的程度，并进一步消灭荒地的杂草。在除草时尤其重要的是铲除苦荬菜的根，并把它集中烧毁，因为在苦荬菜五寸深的根上往往还可以找到棉蚜或它的卵存在。老乡们反映小块地年年先发生棉蚜，用翻土和搬土的法子便可以防止棉蚜的发生，这正是根本铲除了苦荬菜的效果。
    四、预防棉蚜的好处
    “防”同“治”是相辅而行的，但防虫比治虫更重要，因为防虫比起治虫来，有很多好处：
    １、时间上的方便——俗语说“争秋夺麦乱哄花”，又说“麦收一晌”，表示收麦如夺麦一样，一晌的时间都不能晚的。但用药驱除棉蚜的时间，刚好和收麦同时，所以大家便有顾此失彼之感。如果采用事先预防的办法，这种时间上的冲突便没有了。因为铲除苦荬菜等杂草可以在秋末或春初进行，非但时间上从容的多，又可以利用了农闲的时间。
    ２、手续上简便——用药剂治蚜配药时，要经过种种手续，没有除草预防来得简便。
    ３、不需药品及施药的工具——预防棉蚜不需任何药品和施药机器，可以少买许多药和机器，节省了不少的金钱。这在现阶段缺乏药品与施药工具以及一般农民群众的购买力还很小的情况下，特别显得有意义。
    ４、防蚜如防病——防蚜是在棉花还没有受害以前就作好了预防工作。所以棉花一点也不曾受害。治蚜也同治病一样，等到病已经来到身上方去治，就是医治好了，身体业已受了很大的损失。
    ５、除草防蚜附带解决了不少的问题——铲除杂草不但解决了棉蚜为害的问题，并且可以防止许多其他害虫的发生为害，以及植物疾病的传染。杂草丛生每每夺取棉株的阳光、水分以及养分，铲除杂草后非但预防了棉蚜的为害，也收到了保持棉花所最需要的阳光、水分和养分的效果。
    五、苦荬菜是怎样的植物
    苦荬菜冀南一带叫燕儿尾（读如一二一），新乡一带叫鸭鸭苗，菏泽一带叫盐苣子，有些地方又叫兔儿草。它是菊科植物，在田间、地埂、荒地、坟地、河岸及路旁野生，叶长椭圆形，有锯齿，茎叶都很柔弱，偶一弄断便有白汁流出，在春秋开淡黄色花。根为土黄色，非常脆嫩，常有圆的根瘤附生，有宿根性，以根或种籽繁殖，是田间不易除净的杂草。
