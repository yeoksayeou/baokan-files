　　[Our Newspaper] Beijing Telecommunications Bureau employees, to celebrate the success of the first National Congress of the Chinese Telecommunications Workers' Union, enthusiastically responded to the call of the Bureau's union to "formulate production plans, reduce errors, intensify learning, and improve work efficiency," and launched a challenge competition. The eighth group of the East Chang'an Street Business Office first proposed: overcome current shortcomings in work, establish individual production plans, reduce telegram errors, abide by labor discipline, and improve the accuracy, speed, and confidentiality of telegrams. Other groups responded one after another. During the nine days of implementation, the eighth group did not make a single mistake; in terms of labor discipline, phenomena such as handling personal affairs during work hours and poor telegram delivery attitudes were also overcome. The workers of the Line Engineering Brigade were erecting lines between Shijiazhuang and Handan. Upon hearing the news of the congress's opening, they adopted the slogan "Complete the task ahead of schedule to celebrate the success of the congress," transferring their enthusiastic mood to production. They even neglected to eat meals while working, and finally officially connected with Handan on the 4th of this month. The work, originally scheduled for 43 days, was completed in 36 days, creating a new record of high work efficiency. In addition to responding to the union's call, the staff of the Third Bureau's Mechanical Room decided to complete routine maintenance work earlier each day and participate in the adjustment and oiling of secondary selectors, ensuring the thorough repair of 1,280 secondary selectors in the Third Bureau within 25 days to reduce communication disruptions. Three days after putting forward this slogan, they had adjusted 180, and it is expected that they will exceed the work plan. The staff of the machine room, in addition to continuing to research and improve the line fault detector, the No. 13 G-group anti-testing device, and the general group calculation table that they had researched and created, also printed their compiled "Instructions for Various Testing Instruments" into booklets for use throughout the country. They will also take the initiative to contact machine rooms throughout the country to strengthen the smooth flow of international telegrams and save power. The staff of the long-distance exchange have also paid even greater attention to reducing errors in their work. Last month, only ten people made no mistakes; since the congress was held, according to a week's work statistics, 78 out of 122 people made no mistakes, greatly improving efficiency. They are now further studying and improving working systems and ways to eliminate errors. (Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Communication Group)

    制订计划展开竞赛
    工作效率显著提高  庆祝全国电信工代大会成功
    【本报讯】北京电信局职工为庆祝中国电信工会首次全国代表大会的成功，热烈响应本局工会“制定生产计划，减少差错，加紧学习，提高工作效率”的号召，并展开挑战竞赛运动。东长安街营业处第八小组首先提出了：克服目前工作中的缺点，订立个人生产计划，减少电报差错，遵守劳动纪律，提高电报的准确、迅速、保密性，各组纷纷响应。在执行的九天当中，第八小组未出一件差错；在劳动纪律上也克服了班上办私事、发报态度不好等现象。线路工程大队的工友们正在石家庄、邯郸间架线途中，当听到了大会开幕的消息后，便以“提前完成任务庆祝大会的成功”为口号，将热烈的情绪转移在生产上，工作时连饭都顾不上吃，终于在本月四日和邯郸正式通话。预定四十三天的工作，三十六天便完成了，创造了工作效率高的新纪录。三局机械室的工作人员除了响应工会号召外，并决定每日提早完成经常维护工作，全体参加二次预选器之调整注油，保证在二十五天内完成三局一千二百八十个二次预选器之彻底整修工作，以减少通话障碍。他们在提出这个口号后三天的工夫，便调整了一百八十个，预料将可超过工作计划。机务站的职工们除将自己研究创造的线路障碍寻找器、十三号Ｇ组抗测试器和总组计算表等继续研究和改进外，并将自己编译的“各种测验仪器说明书”印制成册，供给全国各地使用；并将主动地和各地机务站联系，加强国际电报的畅通和节省电源。长途台的职工们在减少差错的工作上也更进一步地注意起来。在上月一个月当中，仅仅有十个人没犯错误；自从大会召开以后，据一星期工作的统计，一百二十二人当中有七十八人没有出错，效率提高了很多。现正进一步研究改进工作制度和消减差错的办法。（北京电信局通讯组）
