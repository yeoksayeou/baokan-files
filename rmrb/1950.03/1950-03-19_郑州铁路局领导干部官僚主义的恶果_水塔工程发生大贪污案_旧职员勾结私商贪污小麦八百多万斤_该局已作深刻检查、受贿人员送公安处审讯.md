　　The Evil Consequences of Bureaucratic Leadership of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    A Major Embezzlement Case in the Water Tower Project
    Former Employees Collude with Private Merchants to Embezzle Over Eight Million Jin of Wheat
    The Bureau Has Conducted a Profound Self-Criticism, and the Bribe-Takers Have Been Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau for Interrogation

    [Our Newspaper Zhengzhou News] (By reporter Chen Ji) A serious embezzlement case has occurred in the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's water tower construction project. In November of last year, the bureau contracted the construction of sixteen water towers to private merchants, resulting in the embezzlement of over eight million jin of wheat through collusion between former employees and the merchants. The Central Financial and Economic Commission and the Ministry of Railways have strictly investigated this incident. The bureau leadership has now conducted a profound self-criticism, handed over the main embezzlers to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation, and reported the matter to the Ministry of Railways to request punishment.

    In the bureau's capital construction plan for the second half of last year, they planned to construct sixteen 120-ton water towers. In November, the bureau's Engineering Department drafted an estimate for this project: the cost of each water tower project was set at 568,750 jin of wheat. During the bidding and contracting process, personnel in the Engineering Section of the Engineering Department secretly colluded with the contractors, embezzling and taking bribes. The bid price for each water tower was raised to 1,233,200 jin of wheat. After deducting the cost of steel, which the bureau purchased and supplied itself, the bid price for each water tower was 969,200 jin of wheat, exceeding the original estimate by 68 percent. The bureau leadership did not carefully review this extremely unreasonable and inflated bid price and approved it carelessly. Before contracting the project, the cunning contractors purchased steel in Shanghai, manipulating the market and driving up steel prices. Construction workers in Shanghai reported the sudden increase in steel prices to the Central Financial and Economic Commission. The Central Financial and Economic Commission instructed the Ministry of Railways to investigate. In early January of this year, the Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to immediately investigate and report. At this point, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau began to take the matter seriously, investigating the estimate, bid price, and contract price. They immediately discovered numerous unusual phenomena. For example, the cost of scaffolding and formwork required for each water tower was estimated at 450,720 jin of wheat. These items were originally to be purchased by the bureau and should have remained the property of the bureau after construction. However, the contract between the bureau and the contractors stipulated that these items would belong to the contractors. This single instance of unclear accounting shows that the total value of scaffolding and formwork for the sixteen water towers was 7,211,200 jin of wheat, with a remaining value of 4,800,768 jin of wheat after deducting material consumption. Furthermore, the unit price for earthwork in the foundation of the water tower project was listed at 95 jin of wheat per cubic meter, ten times higher than the general unit price. After discovering this situation, the bureau determined that there was significant embezzlement and waste in this project and ordered the contractors to suspend work on February 10, re-negotiating with them. During the negotiations, the contractors jointly admitted that the bid price was unreasonable and agreed to: (1) Overturn the original bid price, correct the unreasonable unit prices, and set a new contract price of 610,000 jin of wheat per water tower. (2) The bureau would recover any excess materials at the prices of November of last year. (3) The scaffolding and formwork would belong to the bureau after use. (4) The original water tower design would remain unchanged in principle. At the same time, the bureau decided that the contractors would continue to contract the project, otherwise, it would be withdrawn; if they neither continued construction nor returned the project, the matter would be resolved in court. This agreement itself has major shortcomings, namely that it did not investigate and review the criminal relationship and responsibility of the private merchants and embezzlers colluding and conspiring to harm the country.

    According to the bureau's investigation, although the new contract price for each water tower was 610,000 jin of wheat, after deducting the cost of recovering scaffolding and formwork, the new contract price for each water tower was approximately 430,000 jin of wheat, a reduction of 530,000 jin compared to the originally proposed contract price. This meant that the sixteen water towers would cost over eight million jin of wheat less. That is to say, the originally proposed contract price exceeded the actual price by 120 percent.

    In examining the reasons for the occurrence of this incident, the bureau found that there was serious bureaucracy and a lack of regard for state and people's property among the bureau's leadership, and uncovered acts of embezzlement by individual employees of the bureau. The heads of the bureau's Engineering Department, such as Department Chief Zhang Fen, did not carefully study and review the estimate, bid price, and contract price for the water tower project, and simply handed the project over to Pei Baoren, the section chief of the Engineering Section of the department (Pei Baoren was a former employee who fled to Hangzhou before liberation and was repatriated from Hangzhou). During the contracting process, Pei Baoren colluded with the contractors at every turn; after the incident was discovered, he even defended the contractors, saying, "It is common for the bid price to exceed the estimate by 68 percent." Gu Baoshan, another employee of the Engineering Section, was treated to meals, plays, and stays in large hotels by the contractors when he went to Hankou to guarantee the project, and was even given a 17-jewel swimming watch. When employee Chen Weici went to Shanghai to guarantee the project, he stayed at the Oriental Hotel, eating, drinking, and spending extravagantly. This fact indicates that the bureau leadership completely failed to educate former employees and raise their political awareness, and carelessly handed over this expensive project to them, resulting in serious losses to state and people's property. The bureau had not established an economic accounting system in the past, spending money freely and without proper reimbursement. For example, in last year's capital construction expenses, 292 construction projects had advanced funds totaling 12,947,941,807 yuan, but only 81,866,181 yuan was reimbursed, leaving 12,866,075,626 yuan unfinalized and unreimbursed. This practice fully demonstrates the chaos in the bureau's financial work. In January of this year, the Xuzhou Engine Factory under the bureau took out 421 jin of alloy for the A-level overhaul of a locomotive, but only used 274 jin, resulting in 147 jin of alloy being taken out in excess for one locomotive, which shows the seriousness of the waste. According to investigations, many sleepers replaced by various sections and stations were still considered usable for one to two years. For example, Wang Xiude, the stationmaster of Lifeng Station, recently used public funds privately, and individual employees of some sections and stations still had the bad habit of taking bribes and gifts.

    Currently, the bureau has conducted a profound self-criticism of the chaotic phenomena in its past work. The bureau has handed over the main perpetrators in the water tower case, Pei Baoren, Gu Baoshan, and Chen Weici, to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation, and reported the details of the incident to the Ministry of Railways, requesting punishment.

### 郑州铁路局领导干部官僚主义的恶果  水塔工程发生大贪污案  旧职员勾结私商贪污小麦八百多万斤  该局已作深刻检查、受贿人员送公安处审讯

　　郑州铁路局领导干部官僚主义的恶果
    水塔工程发生大贪污案
    旧职员勾结私商贪污小麦八百多万斤
    该局已作深刻检查、受贿人员送公安处审讯
    【本报郑州讯】记者陈迹报道：郑州铁路管理局在建筑水塔工程中发生了严重的贪污案件。去年十一月，该局包给私商承修十六座水塔，竟被旧职员和私商勾结贪污小麦八百多万斤。中央财经委员会和铁道部曾严格追究这一事件。现该局领导上已作深刻检查，除将贪污主要人员送交公安处审讯外，并呈报铁道部自请处分。
    该局在去年下半年工程建设计划中，曾预计修建一百二十吨水塔十六座，十一月该局工务处拟定此项工程概算：每座水塔工程费用定为小麦五十六万八千七百五十斤。在包商投标与包修过程中，工务处工事股人员暗与包商勾结，贪污受贿，发包的每座水塔标价竟提高至小麦一百二十三万三千二百斤，除掉标价中的钢筋一项由路局自购供给外，每座水塔标价为小麦九十六万九千二百斤，比原定概算超出百分之六十八。这种极不合理的太高的标价，该局负责人未加详细审核，竟糊糊涂涂地批准了。狡猾的包商在包修前，曾在上海购买钢筋，操纵市场，钢筋价格因而高涨。上海建筑工人曾将钢筋骤然涨价的情况反映给中央财经委员会。中央财经委员会指令铁道部追究。今年一月上旬铁道部电令郑州路局立即查明呈报。此时，郑州路局才重视此事，追查概算、标价与包价。当即发现无数不应有的奇特现象。例如每座水塔需用的脚手板和模型板的数量，折价为小麦四十五万零七百二十斤，原系由路局出款购制，施工完毕以后本应归路局所有；然在路局和包商签订的合同中，竟将该项器具归给包商。仅以这笔糊涂账来说，十六座水塔的脚手板和模型板合计价值小麦七百二十一万一千二百斤，除去材料消耗费尚值小麦四百八十万零七千六百八十斤。又如包修水塔工程的单价中，基础土方一项工程竟列价每方九十五斤小麦，比一般单价超出十倍。该局发现这种情况后，确定此项工程确有重大贪污和浪费，遂于二月十日命令包商停工，重新和包商谈判。在谈判中，包商共同承认标价的不合理，并协定：（一）推翻原标价，更正不合理的单价，确定每座水塔新包价为小麦六十一万斤。（二）凡超过的材料，由路局按去年十一月价格收回。（三）脚手板和模型板用完后，归路局所有。（四）原水塔设计图样以不变更为原则。同时路局决定此项工程仍由包商继续包修，如不修，即收回；如既不修又不交回，则交法院解决。这个协定本身还有很大缺点，即没有把私商与贪污分子互相勾结、通同作弊、危害国家的罪恶关系和责任予以追究和审查。
    根据该局审查的结果，每座水塔新包价虽为六十一万斤小麦，然除去收回脚手板和模型板等费外，每座水塔的新包价约为小麦四十三万斤，比原拟定包价减少五十三万斤，十六座水塔就要少八百多万斤小麦。那就是说，原拟定的包价比实际价钱超出了百分之一百二十。
    在该局检查这一事件的发生原因时，发现该局领导工作上存在着严重的官僚主义和不重视国家人民财产的思想，并查出该局个别员工的贪污事实。该局工务处处长章奋等负责人对于包修水塔的概算、标价和包价，都没有详细研究和审核，随随便便地把这一工程交给该处工事股股长裴保仁处理（裴保仁是在解放以前逃往杭州，从杭州遣送回来的旧人员）。在包修过程中，裴保仁处处与包商勾结；事件发现以后，他还替包商辩护，说：“标价比概算超出百分之六十八，是常有的情形。”该处工事股另一职员古宝山，到汉口对保时，包商请他吃饭、看戏、住大旅馆、叫妓女，还送给他以十七钻游泳手表。职员陈慰慈到上海对保时，住在东方旅馆，大吃大喝，极尽挥霍之能事。这一事实，指明该局领导上完全没有注意对旧职员的教育，提高他们的政治认识，就马马虎虎的将此项花费很大的工程交给他们办理，致使国家人民财产遭受严重损失。该局过去没有树立经济核算制度，大手大脚，随便花钱，不作报销。比如去年工程费中，有二百九十二件工程预支工程费一二，九四七，九四一，八○七元，报销者仅八一，八六六，一八一元，未作决算报销者为一二，八六六，○七五，六二六元。这样的做法，更充分表现了该局财政工作的混乱。今年一月份该局所辖的徐州机厂甲检一台机车竟领了四百二十一斤合金，实际只用了二百七十四斤合金，一台机车多领了一百四十七斤合金，这就可见其浪费的严重了。各段站很多换下来的枕木，据调查结果，认为还可以用一年到二年。比如最近李封站站长王修德私自动用公款，个别段站的员工仍有受贿、受馈赠的恶习。
    目前，该局对于以往工作中的混乱现象，已作深刻检查。该局已将水塔案件中重要人犯裴保仁、古宝山、陈慰慈等三人，送交公安处审讯；并将事件详情报告铁道部，自请处分。
