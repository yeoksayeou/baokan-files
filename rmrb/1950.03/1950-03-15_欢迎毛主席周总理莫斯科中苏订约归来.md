　　Welcome Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Back from Moscow After Signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty
    Huang Yanpei
    1. Welcome! Welcome! They have returned.
    This journey has created a bond between two great nations of the world.
    Cheers! Cheers! The ecstatic wine of the Kremlin. The five-star flag, intertwined with the hammer and sickle, socialism and new democracy, closely aligned. One before, one after, the ideologies of the two great peoples are interchanging.
    The ideologies of all the world's people are preparing to accept.
    Each and every term, "friendship," "alliance," "mutual assistance,"
    Deeply engraved in the hearts of 700 million people.
    2. Welcome! Welcome! They have returned.
    This journey, a single document, shook the five continents.
    Scaring the imperialists and warmongers into a shiver.
    Spreading rumors! Watch them be disgraced. Arise! Arise! People who refuse to be slaves, arise! Shout with all your might. Atomic energy, use it for construction, and they still want to use hydrogen bombs to intimidate,
    Bah! It's just a silver spearhead with a wax shaft! The "Azure Dragon is bound," "today we hold the long rope."
    We want "lasting peace."
    We want "universal security." Look! Look! The iron fists of 700 million people. (Note) A line from Chairman Mao's poem "Over the Liupan Mountain" during the 25,000-li Long March:
    "Today we hold the long rope, when will we bind the Azure Dragon?"

　　欢迎毛主席周总理莫斯科中苏订约归来
    黄炎培
    一欢迎！欢迎！归来了。
    这一遭，造成世界两大国家携手，
    干杯！干杯！狂喜的克里姆林宫的酒。五星旗，交叉著，镰刀和斧头，社会主义，新民主主义，紧紧地靠拢着，一先一后，两大国人民的思潮在交流。
    全世界人民的思潮在准备着接受。
    一个个名词，“友好”“同盟”“互助”
    深深地镌刻在七万万人的心头。
    二欢迎！欢迎！归来了。
    这一遭，一纸文书，震动了五大洲，
    吓得帝国主义者们，好战者们一齐发抖。
    造谣啊！眼看它丢丑。起来！起来！不愿做奴隶的人们，起来！喊破了歌喉。原子能，拿来建设了，还想把氢气弹来唬吓人，
    呸！还不是银样蜡枪头！“苍龙缚住”了，“今日长缨在手”。
   我们要“持久和平”
     我们要“普遍安全”看！看！七万万人铁的拳头。（注）毛主席二万五千里长征过六盘山词里的句子
    “今日长缨在手，何时缚住苍龙”。
