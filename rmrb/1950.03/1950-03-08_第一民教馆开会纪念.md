The First People's Education Center Holds a Commemorative Meeting

[Our Dispatch] The First People's Education Center in Gulou, Beijing, held a meeting at 7:00 PM on the 7th to commemorate International Women's Day on March 8th. Over 400 attendees included housewives and adult night school students. First, Zhang Jiexun of the Municipal Women's Federation gave a brief history of March 8th and the significance of commemorating it. She also called on everyone to work and study hard, and to strive to be glorious women representatives when the district representatives' meeting is convened. Then, Yang Mianru, Zhang Yuming, and others from the adult night school spoke. They said, "Before liberation, we could not turn ourselves around politically or economically, nor could we turn ourselves around culturally. Since the People's Liberation Army entered the city last year, the government has established adult night schools for us, giving our out-of-school sisters the opportunity to learn. Now we must not only intensify our studies but also participate in production to achieve true liberation." Finally, students from Jianzhi Women's Vocational School performed frontier dances and Mongolian dances, and the Bureau of Culture and Education's film team screened films about International Women's Day and nurseries.

　　第一民教馆开会纪念
    【本报讯】北京鼓楼第一民众教育馆于七日晚七时召开纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会。到会家庭妇女及成人夜校学员共四百余人。首由市妇联张洁珣讲“三八”节简史及纪念“三八”的意义。并号召大家努力工作和学习，在召开区代表会议时，争取当一个光荣的妇女代表。接着由成人夜校杨绵如、章玉名等讲话。她们说：“在未解放前，我们不但在政治、经济上不能翻身，在文化上也同样不能翻身。自从去年解放军进了城，政府给咱们办了成人夜校，使失学的姊妹们都有了机会学习。现在我们不但要加紧学习，还要参加生产，求得真正翻身。”最后由坚志女职的同学表演边疆舞和蒙古舞，由文教局电影队放映国际妇女节与托儿所的影片。
