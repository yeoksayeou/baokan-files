　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, The Hague Dispatch: The Hague International Court issued its opinion on the regulations for approving new member states to join the United Nations on the 3rd. With a majority of twelve votes to two, the International Court rejected the claim made by the Argentine delegation at the third and fourth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, which suggested that the United Nations General Assembly could receive new countries into the United Nations even without the approval of the Security Council. The decision of the Hague International Court actually affirmed the provisions and arguments regarding the principle of unanimity in the Security Council once put forward by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky. Therefore, the International Court also agreed with the Soviet viewpoint. Only two judges (Acevedo of Brazil and Alvarez of Chile) opposed this majority decision in the International Court, thus openly violating the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

　　海牙国际法庭赞成苏联观点
    联合国接受新会员国必须根据大国一致原则
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社海牙讯：海牙国际法庭三日发表其关于批准新会员国加入联合国规定的意见。国际法庭以十二票对两票的大多数，拒绝了阿根廷代表团在联合国大会第三届及第四届会议上所提出的主张，即建议联合国大会甚至可以不须安理会赞成即接收新国家加入联合国。海牙国际法庭的决定实际上是肯定了苏联代表团团长维辛斯基有一次曾经提出的关于安理会中一致原则的规定和论据。因此国际法庭也就是赞成了苏联的观点。只有两位法官（巴西的阿赛菲多与智利的阿发莱斯）在国际法庭上反对这个大多数的决定，从而公开违反了联合国宪章的规定。
