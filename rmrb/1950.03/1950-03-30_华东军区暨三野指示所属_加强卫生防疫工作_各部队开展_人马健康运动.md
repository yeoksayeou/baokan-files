Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 28th: The Political Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army issued instructions in mid-March, calling on the entire army to extensively carry out mobilization, education, and work for sanitary and epidemic prevention. The instructions required Party committees and military and political cadres at all levels to pay attention to the health care of the troops and regard the health of the troops as an important source of combat effectiveness; to pay attention to improving food and nutrition, improving personal and environmental hygiene, and paying attention to the physical exercise and appropriate rest of the troops. Political organs at all levels should regularly understand the health situation of the troops, and promptly report and treat important illnesses; promote the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of all health cadres, and do a good job in the health work of the entire army.

Since last winter, the Logistics and Health Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army has mobilized and organized a large number of personnel, including local medical and health personnel, to carry out intensive treatment for several major endemic and common infectious diseases that pose the greatest threat to the health of the troops, such as Kala-azar, Japanese schistosomiasis, malaria, and plague, and has achieved significant results. The entire army completed vaccinating against smallpox by the end of January; in mid-February, troops stationed in areas where plague had occurred were universally vaccinated against plague; at the same time, many troops launched sanitation campaigns to eliminate scabies and lice, preparing for the large-scale mosquito and fly eradication campaign in the summer. Currently, in order to guide the progress of the troops' health work, in addition to publishing the regular publication "Troop Hygiene," the department is also preparing to compile specialized books on the study of endemic diseases in southeastern China and specialized works on troop nutrition, which will be distributed to medical and health personnel in various departments for reference and research. In addition, the department, with the Anti-Epidemic Department as the main force, has formed an anti-epidemic brigade of more than 80 people, which will go to various units under its jurisdiction to assist in carrying out the anti-epidemic movement. Many troops have now convened health work conferences and are launching the "Human and Animal Health Movement," strengthening epidemic prevention equipment to effectively ensure the health and strong physical strength of the commanders and fighters of the troops.
