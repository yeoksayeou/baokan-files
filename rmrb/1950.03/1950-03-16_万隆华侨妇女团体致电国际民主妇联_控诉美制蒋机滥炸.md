The original telegram is as follows: To Chairperson Cai Chang of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation in Beijing, to be forwarded to the Women's International Democratic Federation:

　　We, representing all overseas Chinese women in Bandung, with utmost sorrow and indignation, condemn the US-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft for their insane and indiscriminate bombing of major cities in our country. Such barbaric, shameless, and inhuman crimes will only deepen the anger and hatred of peace-loving people around the world. We call upon the International Federation of Women to take effective steps to stop this inhumane and bestial behavior. With democratic greetings!
