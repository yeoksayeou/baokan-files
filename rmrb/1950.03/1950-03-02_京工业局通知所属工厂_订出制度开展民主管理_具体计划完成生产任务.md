Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Industrial Bureau recently notified its 23 subordinate public factories and mines that, in addition to seriously and strictly implementing the economic accounting system, they should also create concrete plans for administrative management and political work in the factories and mines in order to guarantee the early completion of this year's production tasks through democratic management and political work. The notice pointed out that all units must repeatedly discuss the democratic management experience of 1949, and then, based on this, formulate the system and steps for democratic management in 1950. Regarding political work in factories and mines, although the Chinese Communist Party branch and the trade union are responsible, administrative heads must also make concrete plans for the whole year. The main contents of the plan should include: employee education, support for workers' clubs, improving employee welfare undertakings, rewarding production models, adjusting wages, safety equipment, protecting factories, solving employees' difficulties in production, and caring for employees' lives, etc.
