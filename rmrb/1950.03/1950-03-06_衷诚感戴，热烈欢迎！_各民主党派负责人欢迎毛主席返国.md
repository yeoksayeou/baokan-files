Sincere Gratitude and Warm Welcome!
Heads of Democratic Parties Welcome Chairman Mao's Return to China

[This newspaper report] Since Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou returned to the capital, the heads of various democratic parties have expressed their opinions one after another, expressing their sincere gratitude and warm welcome to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

　　　　Li Jishen

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said in a statement: "Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people. Thanks to his correct leadership, the Chinese people won the final victory in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. In the three-and-a-half-year War of Liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism were eliminated on the Chinese mainland, and a people's democratic dictatorship was established. Today, for the arduous task of building a new China and for the benefit of the Chinese people, he traveled to the Soviet Union in the harsh winter, working tirelessly to conclude a 30-year alliance between China and the Soviet Union, which has guaranteed the future construction of the new China. Looking forward to the prospects of the new China, how can we not be grateful to Chairman Mao for his hard work and great achievements?"

　　　　Tan Pingshan

Tan Pingshan, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, pointed out: "The signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty is a victory for the united strength of the people of the two major countries, China and the Soviet Union. It defeats the plots of imperialism and war-mongers to instigate and create an atmosphere for a third world war and to sow discord between the people of China and the Soviet Union. It is a great victory for all people who love democracy and peace in the world. Our welcome to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou is also a welcome to this great victory."

　　　　Zhang Lan

Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: "Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's return to China brought the firm will of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union to unite closely and an unprecedentedly powerful force. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and various agreements has not only consolidated the foundation for the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and promoted the speed of economic and cultural construction in the new China, but also laid the foundation for the people's democracy and peace in the East and strengthened the people's democracy and peace in the world. And it gives a thorough blow to the imperialist aggressors headed by American imperialism! Moreover, the imperialists' past attempts to spread rumors, provoke, alienate, and attempt to undermine the friendship and unity between the people of the two great allied countries of China and the Soviet Union have been completely shattered." He also said: "On behalf of the China Democratic League, I express my gratitude to the Soviet Union for this great friendship and express my sincere regards to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for their hard work for the people."

　　　　Shen Junru

Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: "We are talking about learning 'Mao Zedong Thought' every day. This time, Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a concrete manifestation of this great thought." He also said: "Chairman Mao has completed this epoch-making treaty and returned to the motherland, just like bringing back the gospel of the coming liberation of all mankind!"

　　　　Huang Yanpei

Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China National Democratic Construction Association, believes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements signed by Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou in the Soviet Union are unprecedented achievements internationally. He said that Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou are "returning with a guarantee of consolidating peace in the Far East and world peace, returning with the fundamental interests of the people, and returning with chivalrous friendship. We can only welcome them with great enthusiasm! Welcome! Welcome!"

　　　　Ma Xulun

Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said, "Chairman Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people, has just led 475 million Chinese people to stand up from the heavy oppression of imperialism and feudalism. With his foresight, he immediately thought about how to consolidate the victory of our people's revolution. He personally went to the Soviet Union and successfully concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. His achievements are unprecedented in history. We thank Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou."

　　　　Zhang Bojun

Zhang Bojun, on behalf of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, expressed a warm welcome to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for their return to the capital and paid the highest respect to them! He also said: "It is not enough for us to merely express our support for Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou with words and texts and agree with the new Sino-Soviet treaty. We must also express our sincerity with practical actions, active work and correct understanding."

　　　　Peng Zemin

Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, recalled the instructions given by Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou before leaving the country. He said: The people's hopes when they saw Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou off have now been completely brought back.

　　　　Lin Kengsheng

Lin Kengsheng, the person in charge of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's Beijing Office, said: "Our beloved Chairman Mao has returned. We must repay Chairman Mao's meritorious service for fighting for the eternal happiness of our people by working hard to cooperate in liberating Taiwan and completely eliminating the remaining bandits of the Kuomintang."
