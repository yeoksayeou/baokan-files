Inquiries and Answers

Mr. Zhang Xiaoxian:
    You ask: Over 30,000 honored servicemen in Liaodong have been demobilized for production or transferred. Is North China also carrying out this work? As far as we know, in order to ensure that honored servicemen receive living security and continue to serve the people after being wounded, all servicemen who are wounded and unable to work in the military are reviewed and approved by the political organs above the division level, and then introduced to the rear service management organs to participate in production or transfer. This work has always been carried out by the service management organs in North China. The news published on the first page of issue No. 590 of this newspaper is the annual summary of this work in Liaodong Province.

专栏：询问与答复

　　华北是否办理荣誉军人复员生产或转业的工作？张效先君：
    你问：辽东荣誉军人三万多人复员生产或转业，华北是否也进行这个工作？据我们所知，为了使荣誉军人负伤后能得到生活保障与继续为人民服务，凡负伤不能在部队工作之军人，均由师以上政治机关审查批准，然后介绍至后方荣军管理机关介绍参加生产或转业。此项工作华北各地荣军管理机关始终都在进行。本报五九○期第一版所登之消息，乃是辽东省对该项工作之全年总结。
