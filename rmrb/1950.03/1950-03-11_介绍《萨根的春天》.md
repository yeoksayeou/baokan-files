　　Introducing "Spring in Sagen"
    Published by Times Bookstore, written by Guriyev, translated by Wang Zhonghuan

    Guriyev's "Spring in Sagen" is a newly created Soviet novel that tells the story of a production struggle. With a brisk style, it depicts the scenery and customs of "Sagen", reading like a soft lyrical poem, as if a bright spring is jumping before your eyes.

    This is a work with rich ideological content and artistic value.

    This book teaches us that after the old exploitative system is overthrown, the new society must be enriched with new productive forces. Shifting from the war front to the production front requires inspiring people with a hundredfold increase in work perseverance, in order to ensure victory and truly escape the poverty and backwardness that working people have endured for centuries. Comrade Stalin once said that a sense for new things is a noble quality of Bolsheviks, and it is even more necessary to promote this quality in production and construction. Here, Kisha Mubai is an outstanding party member who has promoted this quality. Returning to the countryside from the battlefield, the new environment immediately awakens his new aspirations. He completes one task and then tirelessly takes on another, completely dissolving his family, love, and honor into the new cause. But what about Nikolai, another young man in the book? After returning from the army, he boasts to the villagers about the medals he received, becomes complacent with his position as chairman of the township Soviet, and instead of studying and improving his work, he becomes tired of it. In the end, he is despised by the people and loses his position as chairman.

    Today, the Kuomintang reactionaries have been defeated, and our country is striding forward in developing production and construction. Here, a large number of young people like Kisha Mubai will surely emerge, who will engage in today's work with the same enthusiasm as they did during the war. And as for the likes of Nikolai, of course there will be some who think that: the war is over, and everything is over. Therefore, they turn around and plan for their personal family, enjoyment, fame, and position, neglecting the new cause that is vigorously developing before them. People like this, as Comrade Gao Gang said: "will become an obstacle to the progress of the revolution, and even have the danger of degenerating and regressing, and their past glory and existing position will also be lost."

    Secondly, in the book we also see the contradiction between the new and the old. A group of young people who have been tempered in the new society are fighting to create the future Sagen. We know that the revolution has been victorious, but for a considerable period of time, the people often remain content with the old traditions and prejudices; and these traditions and prejudices are opposed to the growth of new things. Therefore, a revolutionary should recognize the contradiction between the new and the old, and should not ignore it, but should be good at grasping and leading this struggle between the new and the old in order to smoothly advance the revolution. This struggle is a long-term and delicate work, and it is often invisible and intangible, because it lacks the scenes that are generally considered grand and intense, but is reflected in ordinary daily life. Here, Kisha's understanding of this point is still immature. He only treats backward things with hatred and contempt, just as his sister Nina criticized him: "You claim to be an advanced person. You point at others and say they are backward, but what kind of person are you after all!" This is the deficient side of Kisha, which needs to be overcome in the continuous work and training.

　　介绍《萨根的春天》

    古里耶的《萨根的春天》是一部叙述一个生产斗争的故事的苏联新创作小说。它用轻快的笔调，描绘出《萨根》的风物人情，读起来像一首柔和的抒情诗歌，仿佛灿烂的春天跳跃在眼前。
    这是一部具有丰富的思想内容和艺术价值的作品。
    这书教导我们，当旧的剥削制度被打倒以后，新的社会就要以新的生产力充实起来，从战争战线转到生产战线，更要激发人们千百倍的工作毅力，才能使胜利获得保证，才能真正摆脱数世纪来劳动人民的贫困落后的生活。斯大林同志曾经说过，对新鲜事物的感觉是布尔什维克的高贵品质，在生产建设中就更必需发扬这种品质。这里，基沙·牟拜便是发扬了这种品质的优秀党员。他从战地回到农村，新的环境立刻唤起他新的愿望。他完成一个任务而又毫不间歇地肩起另一个任务，把家庭、爱情、荣誉完全溶化于新的事业中去。但是，书中的另一位青年尼古拉又是怎样呢？他从军队回来后，用得来的勋章向乡人夸耀，自满于乡苏维埃主席的地位，不研究改进自己的工作，反而对工作发生厌倦。后来他终于遭到人民的鄙视，主席的地位也失掉了。
    今天，国民党反动派已被打垮了，我们的国家正大踏步地开展生产建设。在这里，一定会大批地涌现出像基沙·牟拜一样的青年，他们将以过去战争时期的热情同样地从事今天的工作；而尼古拉之辈呢，当然也会有的，他们以为：战争结束了，一切就都结束了。因此他们便回过头来打算个人的家庭、享受、名誉、地位，忽略了眼前蓬蓬勃勃开展着的新的事业。这样的人，正如高岗同志所说的：“便会变成革命前进的阻碍，甚至有堕落退化的危险，而他们自己过去的光荣及已有的地位也会丧失掉的。”
    其次，在书中我们又看到新与旧的矛盾。一群在新社会里锻炼出来的年青人，正为创造未来的萨根而奋斗。我们知道，革命胜利了，但是在一个相当长的时期内的人民往往会仍旧安于古旧的传统和成见；而这种传统和成见却是和新鲜事物的生长对抗的。因此，一个革命者就应该认识新旧矛盾，不应视若无睹，而要善于掌握与领导这种新与旧的斗争，才能将革命顺利地推向前进。这种斗争是长期的细腻的工作，并且常常是看不见摸不着的，因为它缺乏被一般人认为轰轰烈烈的场面，而是体现在平凡的日常生活中。这里，基沙对这点的认识还是幼稚的，他只是用仇恨、鄙视的态度来对待落后的事物，正如他妹妹尼娜批评他的：“你自命是一个前进人物。你指着旁人说他们是落伍，但是你自己到底算是怎样的人物了啊！”这是基沙缺点的一面，还需在不断的工作锻炼中加以克服的。
