　　Chahar Province
    Land Reform Basically Completed
    Actively Prepares for Spring Planting While Seizing the Season
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to the Chahar Daily News: Land reform in Chahar Province has basically been completed, and the masses in various areas are actively preparing for spring planting. Before last winter, in fourteen counties with one thousand seven hundred and twenty-two villages, covering approximately 700,000 people, land reform had not yet been implemented, or there were unresolved issues from the land reform. Before the land reform work began, all regions made sufficient ideological and organizational preparations. In August, the province convened an expanded cadre meeting for autumn and winter work, where arrangements were made. Subsequently, various counties universally convened Party representative meetings and people's representative meetings to conduct inspections and make resolutions. Land reform policies were explained and key personnel were trained in four hundred and thirty-six district cadre training classes and twenty-five thousand village cadre training classes. The provincial level also organized a total of three work groups and three inspection groups, with over one hundred people, to go to the countryside to inspect and assist. A strict system of requesting instructions and reporting was established. Therefore, chaotic phenomena such as sealing doors and engaging in random fighting, which occurred in individual areas at the beginning of the movement, were promptly corrected, enabling the land reform work to proceed relatively steadily. Since December of last year, land reform in various regions has generally been closely integrated with winter production and has been carried out around production work. Attention has been paid to using evening time for meetings and avoiding mass meetings without due consideration. Instances of production being delayed due to land reform work are rarely found. Farmer representative meetings have been established in various regions to lead the land reform work. Generally, about one-third of the participants in the farmer representative meetings are middle peasants, which has been effective in consolidating the unity of the middle peasants. Now, the task of land reform in the province has basically been completed, and the villages that have not yet issued land certificates will all be issued by the end of March. After the land reform, farmers in various regions have shown high enthusiasm for production and are now actively preparing for spring planting, seizing the agricultural season.
    The results of implementing land reform: (1) The feudal land system has been eliminated, creating extremely favorable production conditions for the liberated peasants. According to statistics from the North Chahar and North Yan special districts, the liberated peasants have been allocated a total of 926,375 mu of land, 13,913 shi of millet, 4,901 head of livestock, and other materials worth approximately 11,653 shi of millet. (2) The broad masses of farmers have achieved political liberation. The general village administration has undergone preliminary transformations, and the peasants have taken control of the political power. In twenty-eight villages of the Xiaosuangou district in Shangyi, twenty-one villages have adjusted their village cadres, further strengthening the connection between the Party, the government, and the masses, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. (3) The farmers' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, dispelling the ideological concerns of some of the masses and establishing the idea of achieving prosperity through labor. Currently, farmers throughout the province are actively preparing to welcome spring planting and production.

　　察哈尔全省
    土地改革基本完成
    正抓紧季节积极准备春耕
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报消息：察省土地改革已基本完成，各地群众正积极准备春耕。去冬以前，该省有十四个县，共一七二二个村约七十万人口的地区，尚未实行土地改革或有土地改革遗留问题。土改工作开始前，各地曾做了充分的思想准备和组织准备。八月间，该省召开秋冬工作扩大干部会时，即作了布置。接着各县普遍召集党代表会、人民代表会做了检查和决议。并在四三六名区干部，两万五千余人的村干部训练班中，讲明土地改革政策，培养了骨干。省级并组织了共百余人的工作组、检查组各三个，下乡检查帮助。建立了严格的请示报告制度。因之，运动开始时个别地区发生的封门乱斗等混乱现象，都及时得到了纠正。使土地改革工作得以较稳当地进行。从去年十二月开始，各地土改与冬季生产一般地结合较紧，并能围绕生产工作来进行。都注意到利用夜晚时间开会，且不轻易开群众大会。因土地改革工作而耽误生产的现象很少发见。各地都建立了农民代表会来领导土改工作。农代会中，一般有三分之一左右的中农参加领导，对巩固的团结中农做得较好。现全省土改任务已基本完成，一部分未发土地证的村庄，至三月底亦可全部发完。各地农民在土地改革之后，生产热情很高，现正抓紧农业季节，积极准备进行春耕。
    实行土地改革的结果：（一）消灭了封建的土地制度，给翻身农民创设了极为有利的生产条件。据察北、雁北两专区统计，翻身农民共分到土地九二六三七五亩，小米一三九一三市石，牲畜四九○一头，其他物资折米约一一六五三市石。（二）广大农民获得了政治翻身。一般村政权都经过了初步的改造，农民掌握了政权。尚义小蒜沟区二十八村，有二十一个村调整了村干部，进一步密切了党、政与群众的联系，巩固了人民民主专政。（三）农民生产情绪空前高涨，解除了部分群众的思想顾虑，树立了劳动致富的思想。现全省农民正积极准备迎接春耕生产。
