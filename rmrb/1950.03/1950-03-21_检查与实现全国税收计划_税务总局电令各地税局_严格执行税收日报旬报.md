Xinhua News Agency, 20th—The State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government recently issued an order to the tax bureaus of all major administrative regions and centrally-administered municipalities directly under the central government to strictly implement the system of daily and ten-day tax reports. The order stipulates that all cities with an annual tax revenue target of 20 million catties of rice or more and with available telegraphic communication must establish a daily reporting system from March 21st, reporting the tax revenue situation of that day to the State Taxation Administration via telegram or telephone on the following day; the six cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shenyang must also separately report direct tax, commodity tax, and local tax. For those with an annual tax revenue target of less than 20 million catties of rice, and those not submitting daily reports to the State Taxation Administration, the provincial tax bureaus should summarize the tax revenue situation and report it to the State Taxation Administration via telegram or telephone every ten days: the tax revenue situation for the first ten days, middle ten days, and last ten days should be reported on the 17th, 27th, and 7th of the following month, respectively. The order specifically points out that the establishment of the daily and ten-day tax reporting system is related to the inspection and implementation of the national tax revenue plan, and plays a significant role in facilitating fiscal revenue and expenditure scheduling and stabilizing financial prices in various regions. All bureaus must strictly implement the above provisions. Those who neglect or fail to implement them effectively will be subject to disciplinary action. It is understood that the State Taxation Administration had ordered the implementation of the daily tax reporting system in various regions from January 1st of this year in December of last year. Currently, 55 major cities across the country are reporting daily, with Hankou and Xi'an reporting in a more timely and accurate manner. However, some cities have not yet implemented it, while others do not comply with the central government's regulations. For example, cities such as Guangzhou, Xinxiang, Hangzhou, Liuzhou, and Wuxi often delay reporting by five or six days or more. In order to improve and maintain the daily and ten-day tax reporting system, the State Taxation Administration has again ordered all regions to strictly implement the above provisions.

　　检查与实现全国税收计划
    税务总局电令各地税局  严格执行税收日报旬报
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府财政部税务总局顷电令全国各大行政区及中央直辖各省市税务管理局严格执行税收日报与旬报制度。命令规定，凡全年税收任务数折米二千万斤以上而又有有线电报可通的城市，自三月二十一日起，必须建立日报制度，将当天税收情况于次日以电报或电话报告总局；北京、天津、上海、汉口、广州、沈阳等六城市并须将直接税、货物税与地方税三项分开列报。全年税收任务折米二千万斤以下，及不向总局办理日报者，其税收情况由省税务局汇总，每旬以电报或电话向总局报告一次：上旬、中旬、下旬税收情况分别于十七日、二十七日、下月七日报告。命令特别指出，税收日报与旬报制度的建立，关系全国税收计划的检查与实现，对于便利财政收支调度、稳定各地金融物价的作用很大，各局必须严格执行以上规定，如有忽视或执行不力者，应受纪律处分。按税收日报制度曾经税务总局于去年十二月命令各地自今年一月一日起执行。现全国已有五十五个主要城市逐日报告，其中以汉口、西安两地的报告比较及时正确。但有的城市至今尚未执行，有的则不遵守中央规定办理。如广州、新乡、杭州、柳州、无锡等地，常有拖延至五、六天以上补报的现象。税务总局为了健全与坚持税收日报与旬报制度，特再命令各地严格按照以上规定执行。
