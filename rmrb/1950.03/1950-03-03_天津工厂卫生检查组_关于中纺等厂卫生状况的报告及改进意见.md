Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 2nd: The Tianjin Factory Hygiene Inspection Team, jointly formed by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Tianjin Zhongfang Company, Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau, and the Textile Workers' Union, consisting of thirteen members, arrived in Tianjin on February 9th. After seven days of inspection, they returned to Beijing on February 16th. They inspected seven state-owned factories, including Zhongfang Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the Zhongfang Machinery Factory, and the North China Bristle Company, as well as the Zhongfang Hospital. In addition, they inspected four private factories, including Renli Woolen Company, Dasheng Yarn Factory, Beiyang Yarn Factory, and Lizhong Chemical Company. The inspection team has submitted a report on the hygiene conditions of the aforementioned factories and put forward several specific recommendations for improvement. The contents of the report and the recommendations for improvement are as follows:

(1) The Severe Situation of Poor Factory Hygiene

Regarding the environmental hygiene of factories: Only Zhongfang No. 1 Machinery Factory, Renli Woolen Company, and Zhongfang Nos. 5 and 6 were relatively clean. Most factories lacked cleaning and tidying in the open spaces and along the aisles of the workshops, and miscellaneous debris and garbage were piled up in a very disorderly manner. Zhongfang No. 4 alone had approximately one hundred tons of garbage.

Regarding workshop hygiene: Most factories did not pay attention to workshop ventilation. Among the eleven factories, only Zhongfang No. 6 had ventilation equipment, but it was not utilized. In the Beiyang Yarn Factory workshop, brooms were used for sweeping instead of push brushes, causing dust and cotton fibers to fly around the workshop. Zhongfang No. 4 did not clean the workshop during Sunday overtime but swept during working hours on Saturday, which greatly harmed the health of the workers. The air in the raw bristle manufacturing section of the Bristle Company was the worst, with dust like fog in the room and a pungent, fishy odor. The sounds of workers coughing and spitting were chaotic. Among all the factory workshops, the Dasheng Yarn Factory was the dirtiest. The building was old and not cleaned diligently, and the dust on the ceilings and walls was very thick.

In all factories, the temperature difference between workshops was generally significant. In general, the temperature in the spinning and weaving workshops was above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, while the temperature in the blowroom was only about 40 degrees, which easily caused colds.

Spittoons were only seen in the workshops of Zhongfang Nos. 2 and 6, very few in No. 5, and none in the other factories. The old spittoons in the Zhongfang No. 6 workshop had a thick layer of rust because they were rarely cleaned. Workers at the Bristle Company spat frequently, but there were no spittoons, resulting in sputum everywhere. Most factory workshops lacked adequate drinking water facilities, such as few or no water buckets, and loose bucket lids. Only the hot water bucket in the Dasheng Yarn Factory was better. The bucket had a wooden outer layer with cotton stuffed between the inner and outer buckets to keep the water warm, and a tight-fitting wooden lid prevented dust and cotton fibers from flying in. Workers' drinking bowls generally had no lids or fixed places to put them. Some put their bowls next to them or on the machines, and some cooled the boiled water, allowing cotton fibers and dust to fall in. When workers at the Bristle Company drank water, the surface of the water was covered with dust and small pig hairs. The boiled water in Zhongfang Nos. 4 and 5 was very unhygienic.

Workers' toilets were both dirty and scarce; most were squatting pits for fecal extraction. Except for Zhongfang No. 5, which began to install heating, the toilets were generally as cold as ice cellars. Female workers on the first and second floors of the Dasheng Yarn Factory had to go to the third floor to relieve themselves. The entire factory had 390 employees, but there were only four toilets for men and women. The flush toilet was out of order, the feces were a mess, and the toilet paper was all over the floor, making it difficult to enter due to the dirt and smell! The toilets at Zhongfang No. 4 had no lights at night, and the skylights were nailed shut with wooden boards, so even during the day, people had to walk by feeling the walls. The factory's burlap bag factory had only one toilet pit for more than 200 female workers. The first machine factory of Zhongfang had 209 employees and only one urinal. The vast majority of toilets in various factories did not have toilet seats, which was particularly inconvenient for pregnant women; the cold wind from under the pits directly hit them, and many female workers suffered from gynecological diseases. According to workers at Zhongfang No. 5, flies and mosquitoes flew around in the summer, and maggots crawled out, which shows how dirty it was.

Most factory workshops did not have hand-washing facilities. More than ten workers at the first machine factory of Zhongfang shared a large basin for washing hands, and the water turned black after washing. Although the Bristle Company had hand-washing facilities, the workers had no habit of washing their hands and ate immediately after work.

Some workshops had very few lockers for storing clothes, which were insufficient, or they had them but did not make good use of them.

Regarding safety equipment: Safety devices on machines were generally absent except for Zhongfang No. 5. There were generally no standing boards in the cement workshops. The Lizhong Acid Factory did not provide any subsidies for work that harmed health. Workers did not wear masks or leather gloves and did not wear rubber boots when working. The sulfuric acid gas in the lead room's high tower was pungent and easily damaged the lungs, but the workers had no protective equipment. The welders at the Zhongfang Machinery Factory did not have tinted glasses, so they needed 20 minutes to recover their vision after stopping work. The workers in the carpentry workshop did not have masks, and wood chips flew around, which was very harmful to the respiratory system. The paint barrel room was small and stuffy, and paint workers sometimes suffered from poisoning and skin swelling. The sand casting room was too cold and the ground was damp, and many workers squatted on the ground to work, resulting in many cases of hemorrhoids. The occurrence of various occupational diseases should arouse due attention to the issue of labor protection.

Hygiene Conditions of Several Welfare Facilities

Canteens: Except for the canteen of Zhongfang No. 2, which was larger, the canteens of other factories were very small. The Bristle Company did not even have canteen facilities. Most workers brought their own meals or had them delivered and ate in the workshop. People with illnesses did not eat separately in the canteen (only Zhongfang No. 6 had tables for those with infectious diseases), and everyone shared bowls and chopsticks, which were only washed once with warm water. People smoked and spat at will in the canteen, and there were generally no spittoons. The vast majority of workers who brought their own meals ate cold steamed buns.

Dormitories: Female workers at the Beiyang Yarn Factory shared a small room with seven to twelve people, with bunk beds, and some had very poor lighting. The air in the workers' dormitories in various factories was very poor, and most had no spittoons; although No. 2 had them, they were not emptied for several days. The hygiene in the workers' family dormitories was the worst. Most rooms had smokeless stoves without chimneys, and people were not used to opening windows. The mother of Yang Shuming, chairman of the Zhongfang No. 2 trade union, was almost suffocated by coal smoke. The Bristle Company and the Dasheng Yarn Factory had not yet established workers' dormitories.

Bathhouses: The bathhouses in most factories had shallow water, small pools, and cold rooms, and the water was changed infrequently. The Beiyang Yarn Factory had only one bathhouse for 800 female workers. Zhongfang No. 4 divided a bathhouse into two parts, with more than 2,100 male and female workers each using half, and it was only open three times a week.

Barbershops: The Bristle Company, Dasheng Yarn Factory, and Lizhong Chemical Factory had not yet established them. Although other factories had barbershops, the utensils were not disinfected, and the hygiene was very poor.

Nurseries: Except for a few factories in Zhongfang that accepted children aged one month to two weeks, most only accepted breastfeeding infants under one year old. Renli only accepted one child, and Dasheng only accepted five. Among the nurseries in various factories, only Zhongfang Nos. 2 and 4 had isolation rooms for sick children. At the No. 5 nursery, mothers brought meals to the nursery at noon, breastfeeding their babies while eating themselves, resulting in a noisy environment and very poor air. The nursery at the Beiyang Yarn Factory was dirty, the beds had no railings, and the children's pillows and quilts were shared by day and night shifts, which easily spread diseases. Currently, six children suffer from ear infections, and two suffer from impetigo. There were both cats and dogs in the room, which was very detrimental to hygiene. The nursery at Renli Woolen Company restricted infants under one year old from entering, resulting in thirteen children under two years old being unable to enter. Those who had no one to take care of their children at home had to take leave and stop working.

Diseases and Medical Treatment: The most common diseases among workers were colds, digestive system diseases, respiratory system diseases, and menstrual problems. Although most factories had medical rooms, they generally focused on treatment and neglected prevention. Some medical workers in the factory believed that cleaning and hygiene work was an administrative matter and had nothing to do with their work. Generally, an average of about one hundred people per day visited the doctor in a factory with more than a thousand people, but there was only one formal doctor. With many patients and few doctors, they could not examine patients carefully, resulting in poor results. There were no female gynecologists in the various factories, and female workers had feudal ideas and were unwilling to be treated by male doctors, so menstrual problems among female workers could not be diagnosed and treated.

In the past, there were no physical examinations in the factories, so there were no accurate statistics on the health and disease conditions of workers. Workers themselves, due to their livelihood, only sought medical treatment when their illness became so severe that they could not support their work. It is understood that in 1949, fourteen workers died at the Zhongfang No. 5 factory, most of whom suffered from lung diseases.

(2) Recommendations for Improvement

Based on what was seen in the eleven factories during this inspection, the problem of factory hygiene is very serious, but it has not attracted the attention of factory staff, and private factories are even worse than state-owned factories. For example, workers at the Dasheng Yarn Factory worked continuously for ten hours on the night shift without rest or meal time; the Lizhong Acid Factory worked for twelve hours without any subsidies for harm to workers' health; and the hygiene conditions of the Bristle Factory were even worse and must be improved immediately. Due to the bureaucratic style of the administrative and trade union leadership of state-owned factories, they rarely paid attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of workers' toilets, hot water, workshops, and dormitories. This shows that they did not value the health of workers and did not understand the close relationship between protecting workers' health and improving production. Therefore, they had a production plan for 1950 but no factory hygiene improvement plan for 1950. Although the factory hygiene problems of Zhongfang Nos. 1 and 3 have begun to attract the attention of leaders since they were pointed out in the newspaper, it is not enough and must be continuously studied and improved and persisted in.

In order to solve the current serious unsanitary situation in factories, the inspection team specifically puts forward the following suggestions to Tianjin's public and private factories:

I. Several Suggestions for Factory Leaders

(1) First of all, it is required that administrative leaders pay practical attention to the daily life hygiene of workers in their thinking, care about their health, improve their working conditions, and pay attention to their labor safety; they must often study how to make them get sick less often or not get sick at all, and how to reduce their fatigue or quickly recover from fatigue. Only by making workers have healthy bodies can their high production capacity be maintained regularly and persistently, and can the industrial construction of the new democratic New China be successfully achieved.

(2) The factory trade union committee should cooperate with the administrative side to widely launch a mass hygiene movement among the workers and their families. It should start with education, conduct hygiene education among workers and their families in an organized and planned manner, and on a regular basis. The methods should be diverse, such as using classes, pictures, wall newspapers, slogans, dramas, and Yangge dances to instill scientific hygiene knowledge as much as possible; and physical exercise can be promoted to strengthen the body. The practice of the Zhongfang No. 6 trade union organizing a "workers' family committee" and launching a clean hygiene campaign among workers' families, thereby achieving results, should be learned.

(3) Zhongfang Company and various factories should establish specialized hygiene institutions, such as hygiene sections or hygiene committees, or assign specific personnel to be responsible for ensuring the regular conduct of factory hygiene and safety work.

(4) Administrative personnel should treat all measures to improve factory hygiene conditions and promote workers' health as tasks that are as important as completing production tasks. At present, it is necessary to make a relatively detailed plan under the conditions that the national economy can afford, and to distinguish between priorities and urgencies, so that it can be done step by step and in a planned way, and to oppose the practice of treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts, grabbing a handful of things randomly, and giving up halfway.

(5) Factory medical institutions and medical personnel should also treat improving factory cleaning and hygiene, preventing the occurrence of diseases, compiling disease statistics, studying the causes of diseases, formulating measures to eliminate diseases, and conducting hygiene education for workers as part of their own professional work. In the future, when leaders inspect the work of this department, they should include the increase or decrease of sick employees in the factory as one of the contents of the work inspection.

(6) Various hygiene rules should be formulated and implemented effectively. For example, cleaning and hygiene rules for workshops, canteens, dormitories, toilets, etc., should be discussed and implemented by all workers, and a certain inspection system should be established to make periodic summaries. All opportunities should be used to communicate the rules and the results of each period's summary to the masses. It is necessary to ensure that rewards and punishments are clear and strict in order to promote progress.

II. Several Measures to Improve Factory Hygiene at Present

(1) Different diseases among workers should be paid attention to separately, and their own attention should be aroused. Those with infectious diseases should be isolated to a certain extent, such as those with lung diseases should be separated as much as possible for living and eating, those with skin diseases should take baths separately in bathhouses, and those with trachoma should not share washbasins and towels with everyone. Those with gastrointestinal diseases should pay attention to their diet.

(2) Toilets should be transformed and expanded on the basis of the existing foundation. First, try to increase the number of toilets so that there are enough for male and female workers to use. Second, it is best to use the method of flushing with water every five minutes (like Zhongfang No. 2). Third, install heating to prevent the temperature difference between the workshop and the toilet from being too large. Fourth, make one or two toilet seats in each female toilet for pregnant women to use. Fifth, maintain a certain amount of light, the windows should have glass, and should not be nailed shut with wooden boards, and there should be electric lights at night. Sixth, the fecal pits of the fecal extraction type in female toilets should be reduced or not allowed to blow wind to prevent the continued increase in gynecological diseases among female workers. Seventh, prevent flies and set up screens in summer. Eighth, urge cleaners to clean frequently and maintain cleanliness and hygiene.

(3) Each workshop must be equipped with one or two hot water buckets, the lids must be tight, and the inside of the bucket must be washed at least once a day; if water is being carried, the bucket must have a lid, and these must be the responsibility of designated personnel. Everyone must have a porcelain cup with a lid, and the method of No. 5 factory can be adopted, with the factory uniformly ordering and deducting from wages later, and stipulating a place for tea cups to be placed.

(4) Find a way to steam hot food for workers who bring their own meals, so that they do not eat cold food. It is best to designate a certain place for food to be placed, and at the same time, try not to eat in the workshop. Workers in each workshop can be organized to take turns eating in the canteen. Workers who go to the factory gate to pick up food must be allowed to wear cotton clothes in winter to prevent colds.

(5) Each workshop should add tap water hand-washing facilities, with soap and towels.

(6) Lockers must be added to the workshop. Those that are already there can be modified if they are not suitable. Once distributed, they can be labeled with names for their use, and the inside of the lockers should be kept clean. Food and sundries should be placed separately.

(7) The ceilings, floors, walls, and glass windows of the workshop should be cleaned and wiped frequently. It is best to clean during parking time and holidays, in short, to not harm the health of workers. Standing boards should be made in the cement workshops.

(8) The temperature and humidity of the workshop must be carefully studied and adjusted, especially in the spinning and weaving workshops. If the temperature is too high, it should be adapted to the health of workers to the greatest extent possible without affecting production. Existing ventilation equipment should be well utilized, and skylights should not be closed too tightly, at least for half an hour during lunch breaks. The temperature in the blowroom, which is too low, should be raised.

(9) Zhongfang Company should organize research on how to reduce the water vapor on the ceiling of the weaving room to avoid water dripping down and damaging the cloth, and at the same time, prevent the floor from being too slippery, which is inconvenient for walking; and the humidity in the dyeing workshop should be reduced as much as possible.

(10) Machine safety devices should be gradually added to ensure worker safety.

(11) There should be an isolation room in the nursery, and sick children should be isolated in another room; a separate breastfeeding room should be set up, and mothers should not breastfeed or eat in the infants' living room; infants' pillows and quilts should not be shared.

(12) The factory dormitory's blocked ditches should be dredged immediately, and garbage should be eliminated to prevent the breeding of infectious diseases in the spring.

The above measures to improve factory hygiene at present must be done, and can be done without spending a lot of money. In addition, it is hoped that the administrative and trade union departments of various factories will give full play to everyone's wisdom and study more good ways to improve the health and life of all workers and staff.

　　天津工厂卫生检查组
    关于中纺等厂卫生状况的报告及改进意见
    【新华社北京二日电】中央人民政府劳动部、卫生部、纺织工业部、中华全国总工会、天津中纺公司、天津市卫生局及纺织工会联合组成的天津工厂卫生检查组一行十三人自二月九日抵津起，经过七天检查，至二月十六日返京；共检查了中纺二、四、五、六、七各厂，中纺机器厂，华北猪鬃公司等七个公营工厂及中纺医院；此外并检查了仁立毛织公司，达生纱厂，北洋纱厂，利中化学公司等四个私营工厂。检查组已就上述各工厂的卫生状况，提出报告，并提出若干具体的改进意见。兹获悉其报告书内容及改进意见如下：
            （一）工厂卫生恶劣的严重状况
    关于工厂的环境卫生方面：只有中纺第一机器厂，仁立毛织公司，中纺五、六厂较为整洁。多数厂中在工场隙地及走道两旁缺少清扫与整理，杂物垃圾堆积得杂乱非常。仅中纺四厂，即约有百余吨垃圾。
    车间卫生方面：多数工厂均不注意车间通风。十一个厂中只有中纺六厂有通风设备，但亦未加利用。北洋纱厂车间，打扫用扫帚而不用推刷，致灰尘棉絮飞扬车间。中纺四厂，不在星期日加班清扫车间，而在星期六工作时间打扫，大大有损工友健康。猪鬃公司的生鬃制造股的空气最为恶劣，室内尘土若雾，腥臭呛人。工友之咳嗽声与吐痰声嘈杂一片。各厂车间以达生纱厂最为脏污，建筑陈旧而又不勤于打扫，在天花板、墙壁上的灰尘甚厚。
    各厂中，车间与车间的温度，普遍悬殊。一般的，细纱间与织布间的温度都在华氏八十度以上，而清花间则只有四十度左右，因而极易引起感冒。
    痰盂的设备只在中纺二、六厂车间见到，五厂很少，其他厂就没有。中纺六厂车间几个旧痰盂里层贴有很厚的锈，因为很少洗刷。猪鬃公司工友吐痰频繁，并没有一个痰盂，致随地都是痰。多数厂车间的饮水设备不完善，如水桶很少，或没有，桶盖不严等。其中仅达生纱厂的开水桶较好。该桶外层加一木制桶，内外桶之间塞以棉花，使水保暖，上有木盖严盖，灰尘棉絮不能飞入。工友们的喝水碗普遍的没有盖子及固定的放处，有的就把碗放在身旁或车上，有的将开水凉起，一任棉絮灰尘落入。猪鬃公司工友喝水的时候，水面上已满浮尘土与细小的猪毛。中纺四、五两厂所烧开水很不合卫生。
    工人厕所既脏又少；大多数为蹲坑掏粪式。除中纺五厂开始装置暖气外，厕所中普遍的是冷若冰窖。达生纱厂一、二楼的女工要跑到三楼解手。全厂三百九十个职工，男女厕所只有四个。抽水机已失用，粪便狼藉，手纸遍地，其脏臭实难涉足！中纺四厂的厕所夜间无灯，天窗又用木板钉死，即白日入厕中都要用手摸着墙壁走。该厂麻袋厂二百多女工只有一个厕坑。中纺第一机器厂二百零九个职工只有一小便池。各厂绝大多数厕所无马桶设置，对孕妇尤为不便；坑下冷风直冲，女工多患妇科病。据中纺五厂工友说，夏天蚊蝇乱飞，蛆虫外爬，其肮脏可知。
    多数厂车间都没有洗手设备，中纺机器第一厂十多工友共一大盆洗手，洗手后水已变成污黑。猪鬃公司虽有洗手设备，但工友全没洗手习惯，工作毕立即吃饭。
    放衣物的橱柜，有的车间很少，不敷应用，或有而没很好利用。
    安全设备方面：机器上的安全装置除中纺五厂外，普遍没有。水门汀的车间普遍没有站板。利中酸厂对危害健康的工作一概没有补助费。工作时工友们不戴口罩和皮手套，不穿胶皮靴。铅房高塔硫酸气刺鼻，易伤肺部，但工友无任何保护装备。中纺机器厂电焊的工友没有茶色眼镜，致停止工作后需二十分钟视力才能恢复正常。木作间的工友没有口罩，木屑纷飞，对呼吸器官甚为有害。漆筒管室屋小气闷，油漆工有时中毒，皮肤肿胀。翻砂间太冷，地又潮湿，工友们多蹲地工作，很多患痔疮症。各种职业病的发生应该引起对于劳动保护问题的应有注意。
            几种福利设施的卫生状况
    食堂：除中纺二厂的食堂较大外，其他工厂的均很小。猪鬃公司且无食堂设备。多数工友由家中带饭和送饭，在车间吃。食堂中对有病的人没有分开吃（只有中纺六厂有传染病者食桌），大家共用碗筷，而碗筷只用温水洗一次。食堂中随便吸烟吐痰，普遍不设痰盂。带饭吃的工友绝大多数是吃冷馒头。
    宿舍：北洋纱厂女工，七至十二人共一室，室窄小，双层床位，有的光线很差。各厂工人宿舍室内空气都很不好，多数没痰盂；二厂虽有，但数日不倒。宿舍中卫生以工属宿舍为最差，室内多数装有无烟筒的火炉，又不习惯开窗，中纺二厂工会主席杨树明的母亲即几被煤烟熏死。猪鬃公司和达生纱厂则尚未建立工人宿舍。
    浴室：大多数工厂的浴池是水浅、池小，室内较冷，换水次数少。北洋纱厂八百女工只有一个浴池。中纺四厂将一个澡塘分成两部，二千一百多男女工友各用一半，而每周只开放三次。
    理发室：猪鬃公司、达生纱厂、利中化学厂等还没有建立，其他各厂虽有理发室，但用具不消毒，卫生都很差。
    托儿所：除中纺有几个厂受托一个月到二周岁的儿童外，多数只受托一周岁以下的哺乳婴儿。受托儿童数目仁立只一名，达生只五名。各厂托儿所中只有中纺二、四厂有患病儿童隔离室。五厂托儿所，中午母亲们带饭入所，一边给婴儿哺乳，一边自己吃饭，人声嘈杂，空气甚坏。北洋纱厂托儿所室内脏污，床位没栏杆，儿童枕被，日夜班者共用一套，极易传染疾病。现有六人患耳炎，二人患黄水疮。室内猫狗俱全，甚不利卫生。仁立毛呢公司的托儿所，因限制一周岁内的婴儿才能入所，致使十三个两周岁以下的儿童不得入所。家庭无人照顾小孩者，只得请假停工。
    疾病及医药治疗：工友中的疾病，以感冒、消化器官病、呼吸器官病、月经病为最多。多数厂虽然都有医疗室，但普遍地忙于治疗而忽视预防。有的厂中医务工作者认为清洁卫生工作是行政上的事情，与自己工作无关。一般一千多人的工厂平均每天都有百人左右看病，而正式医生只有一位。病人多，医生少，看病不能仔细，因而效果很差。各厂都没有女的妇科医生，女工们又存在有封建意识，不愿请男医生诊治，致女工中的月经病无法进行诊断及治疗。
    过去工厂中没有体格检查，所以关于工友健康及疾病状况都没有确切的统计数字。工友本身因生活所关，也只有等待病势严重不能支持工作时才去就医。据了解一九四九年度中纺五厂死亡工友十四人，大部是患的肺病。（⑵⑶）
            （二）改进的意见
    以本次在十一个厂中所见，总的说来，工厂卫生问题是很严重的，但没有引起工厂工作人员的注意，而私营厂较公营厂为尤差。如达生纱厂夜工连续十小时，没有休息及吃饭时间；利中酸厂工作十二小时而危害工友身体健康的补助一概没有；猪鬃工厂的卫生条件更坏，必须立即设法改进。公营工厂的行政和工会的领导方面，由于工作不深入的官僚主义作风，极少注意工人的厕所、开水及车间、宿舍的清洁卫生等问题，这就是不重视工人的健康，不了解保护工人健康与提高生产的密切关系，因此，有了一九五○年的生产计划，却没有一九五○年的工厂卫生改进计划。虽然自从报纸上指出中纺一、三厂的工厂卫生问题以后，已开始引起领导人员的注意，但还不够得很，尚须继续加以研究改善，坚持下去。
    为解决目前工厂中存在着的严重的不卫生的情形，该检查组特向天津公私营工厂提出以下建议：
        一、对工厂领导人员的几点建议
    ①首先要求行政领导人员思想上切实注意工人们日常的生活卫生，关心他（她）们的健康，改善他（她）们的劳动条件和注意他（她）们的劳动安全；要经常研究如何使他（她）们少生病，或不生病，如何使他（她）们减少疲劳或迅速恢复疲劳。因为只有使工友们有健康的身体，才能使其高度的生产能力保持经常、持久，才能使新民主主义新中国的工业建设顺利获得成功。
    ②工厂工会委员会要配合行政方面在工人中广泛展开群众性的卫生运动，要先从教育着手，有组织、有计划而且要经常地在工人中、工属中进行卫生教育。方式要多样性的，如利用上课、图画、墙报、标语、演剧和扭秧歌等方式，尽量灌输科学的卫生知识；并可提倡体育运动，以锻炼身体。象中纺六厂工会组织“工属委员会”，在工属中展开清洁卫生运动，因而取得成绩的作法，是应该学习的。
    ③中纺公司及各厂，要建立专门的卫生机构，如卫生科或卫生委员会等，或责成专人负责，以保证工厂卫生安全工作之经常进行。
    ④行政人员要把改善工厂的卫生条件，促进工人健康的一切措施当成一个与完成生产任务同样重要的任务来进行。目前需要在国家经济所能及的条件下，作出比较周密的计划，务要分清轻重缓急，使能有步骤、有计划地做去，反对头疼医头、脚疼医脚，乱抓一把，一曝十寒的做法。
    ⑤工厂医务机关及医务人员应将改善工厂清洁卫生，预防疾病发生，统计病种，研究疾病原因，制订消除疾病措施，以及对工友进行卫生教育等事同样当做自己业务工作的一部分。今后领导人检查该部门工作时，应将该厂患病职工之增减，作为工作检查内容之一。
    ⑥要制订各种卫生规则，并使之切实执行。如车间、食堂、宿舍、厕所……的清洁卫生规则，经全体工友讨论执行后，并要建立一定的检查制度，作出定期总结。利用各种机会将各规则及各时期总结结果向群众传达。一定要做到奖惩严明，以利推动。
        二、目前改善工厂卫生的几点措施
    （1）对工人中不同的病症要分别予以注意，并唤起其本人的注意。其有传染性病症的，要做到一定的隔离，如患肺病者尽可能实行分居分食，有皮肤病者要分开澡塘洗澡，害砂眼者不要和大家共用脸盆毛巾。其患肠胃病者要注意饮食。
    （2）厕所根据现有基础加以改造与扩充。第一、设法加多，做到使男女工友足够使用。第二、最好用五分钟冲水一次的办法（象中纺二厂那样）。第三、设暖气使车间温度与厕所温度不致悬殊。第四、每个女厕所做一、二马桶，供孕妇之用。第五、要保持一定的光线，窗户要有玻璃，不得用木板钉死，夜间要有电灯。第六、女厕中之掏粪式的粪坑应减少或不使其吹风，以防女工妇科病之继续增多。第七、要防蝇，夏季要设纱窗。第八、督促清洁员勤于打扫，保持清洁卫生。
    （3）每一车间必须设一、二开水桶，盖子要严密，桶内每日至少洗涤一次；如果是挑水，桶上须制盖，这些都要有专人负责。每人须有一带盖的洋瓷缸，可采取五厂的办法，由厂方统一订购，以后由工资中扣除，并规定茶杯放置的地方。
    （4）设法替带饭的工友蒸热饭菜，不使冷食。饭菜最好指定一定的地方放，同时尽量不在车间吃饭，可组织各车间工友轮流到饭堂吃饭。到厂门外接饭的工人冬季必须让其穿上棉衣，使不致引起感冒。
    （5）每个车间要添设自来水的洗手设备，要有肥皂、手巾。
    （6）必须添置车间衣柜，已有的如不适用可加以改造，一经分配后，可贴以姓名，供其使用，并使柜内保持整洁，食物及零用物品另外放置。
    （7）车间顶棚、地板、墙壁及玻璃窗要勤于打扫揩拭，最好利用停车时间及休假日清扫，总之以不妨碍工人健康为准。水门汀的车间要做站板。
    （8）车间温湿度必须很好研究调剂，特别是细纱和布机间，温度过高，在不影响生产的情况下，应以最大的限度适应工人健康。已有的通风设备应很好的利用起来，天窗不要关闭过于严密，至少午间休息时可开半小时。清花间的温度过低的应设法使之提高。
    （9）中纺公司应该组织研究如何使布机间顶棚上的水蒸汽减少，免得水点下滴，损坏布匹，同时亦不至使地板太滑，不便行走；并应使染厂车间湿度设法减低。
    （10）机器安全装置应逐步加以增设，以保障工人安全。
