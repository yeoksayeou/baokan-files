    (Twenty-one)
    Liu Guicai was一心 (single-mindedly) determined to get Cui Cui. The lackeys in the accounting office offered suggestions, saying, "Now, everywhere is arresting Communists. You've become the head of the Anti-Communist Defense Corps, so just say that Genyuan is a Communist, arrest him, and then have Liu Shunyi's wife from Shunyi Store trick Cui Cui into coming over." Liu Guicai was overjoyed to hear this.
    (Twenty-two)
    The next day, Liu Guicai led the militiamen to Genyuan's house in a menacing manner, saying that Genyuan was a Communist, and tied him up. Cui Cui was so frightened that she knelt on the ground and begged. Liu Guicai ignored her and ordered the militiamen to take Genyuan away.
    (Twenty-three)
    Liu Guicai arrested Genyuan and personally interrogated him, beating him half to death. He passed out several times, but he didn't give any confession. Everyone in the village knew the reason, but no one dared to say a word. That day, Liu Guicai locked Genyuan in the coal house in the village office, preparing to complete the official procedure and send him to the county the next day.
    (Twenty-four)
    In the afternoon, Cui Cui delivered a meal. Genyuan was crawling on the window. Cui Cui saw that his face was yellow and white, with streaks of blood running down his face. Cui Cui said sadly, "You..." She had just uttered one word when she was stopped by the guard, who said, "The head ordered that no outsiders are allowed to speak to Communists!" Cui Cui stared at Genyuan blankly for a few moments, then cried and returned.

    刘贵财一心要想把翠翠弄到手里，帐房狗腿子们从旁出主意说：“现在各地都在抓共产党，你当了防共保卫团的团长，就说根元是共产党，把他抓起来，然后叫顺义店刘顺义的老婆再把翠翠弄过来。”刘贵财一听非常高兴。
    （廿二）
    第二天，刘贵财带了团丁气势汹汹的到了根元家，说根元是共产党，就把根元捆起来。翠翠嚇得跪在地上哀求。刘贵财毫不理睬，叫团丁把根元带走。
    （廿三）
    刘贵财抓了根元，亲自拷问，将他打得死去活来，昏过去好几次，也没有落下口供。村里人都知道怎个情由，但没个人敢说句话。当天刘贵财把根元关在村公所炭房子里，准备做好公事，第二天往县上送。
    （廿四）
    下午翠翠给送了一次饭。根元爬在窗口上，翠翠见他脸色黄白，顺脸流下几道血迹。翠翠伤心的说：“你……”她刚吐了一个字，就被看守的人喊住了，说：“团长吩咐，不准外人和共产党说话！”翠翠呆呆看了根元几眼，哭着回来了。
