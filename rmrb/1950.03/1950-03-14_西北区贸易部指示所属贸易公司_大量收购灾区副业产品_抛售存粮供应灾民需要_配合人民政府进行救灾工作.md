Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th. The Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee recently issued instructions on disaster relief work, instructing subordinate trade companies in various regions to cooperate with the local People's Government and the Production and Disaster Relief Committee to carry out disaster relief work. The instructions require subordinate trade companies in various regions to immediately take the following measures based on the actual situation in their localities: (1) Massively purchase by-products from farmers in disaster areas, such as homespun cloth produced by rural women and mountain products that are unique to the Northwest, to encourage and organize disaster victims to engage in production for self-relief; (2) Before the new wheat comes on the market, sell grain reserves in a planned and step-by-step manner to supply the needs of disaster victims and stabilize prices; (3) Appropriately control the reasonable price difference of grain between various regions. In addition to the company's own transportation, actively organize the labor of workers and farmers to transport surplus grain from grain-producing areas to disaster areas. The instructions also pointed out that the disaster situation in the Guanzhong area is relatively serious, and trade work should complete the task of purchasing 100,000 bolts of homespun cloth in conjunction with disaster relief. The Mountain Products Company should, according to the overall plan, focus on arranging for the vigorous purchase of bristles, casings, and marketable medicinal materials in severely disaster-stricken areas.
