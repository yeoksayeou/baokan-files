Dear Mr. Cai Chang:

The Soviet Anti-Fascist Women's Committee warmly congratulates you and all Chinese women represented by you on the March 8th International Women's Day.

On this great festival, Soviet women pay tribute to the glorious Chinese sisters who are striving for a free and independent life of happiness and wish them new successes in their heroic labor for the welfare of the People's Republic of China.

On the eve of the 1950 International Women's Day, the biggest event is the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements. Soviet women, like all the people of the Soviet Union, see in this treaty the sincere friendship and permanent cooperation between the great people of our two countries, striving for universal peace and the happy lives of our children.

Long live the solid and unbreakable friendship between the women of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the March 8th International Women's Day for women of all countries to fight for world peace and democracy!

Soviet Anti-Fascist Women's Committee

(II) Telegram from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to Mrs. Popova of the Soviet Anti-Fascist Women's Committee:

On the joyous occasion of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, all Chinese women extend warm congratulations to our Soviet sisters.

Due to the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, are more closely united, and the friendship and cooperation between the women of China and the Soviet Union have also been enhanced. We must work together to consolidate the relations between China and the Soviet Union and consolidate the world peace front headed by the Soviet Union.
