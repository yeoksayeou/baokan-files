　　Two Batches of Villages in the Suburbs of Beijing Complete Land Reform
    Peasants' Production Enthusiasm Increases
    Land Reform in the Last Sixty-Odd Villages Has Also Begun
    [From Our Newspaper] As of the 25th, land reform in the suburbs of Beijing has been successfully completed in 176 villages. This includes eight experimental villages, 74 villages in the first batch of land reform, and 94 villages in the second batch of land reform (out of a total of 102 villages in the second batch, the last eight villages will be completed within a few days). The land reform work in the third batch of 64 villages has also officially begun.
            Land reform has brought about fundamental changes in class relations.
    The results of land reform in the first and second batches of villages have brought about fundamental changes in land relations and class relations in the suburbs of Beijing. Taking the first batch of 74 land reform villages as an example, before land reform, landlords, managing landlords, and old-style rich peasants accounted for 8.6 percent of the total population of 139,562, but possessed 43.2 percent of the total land area of 334,311 mu. Landlords, who accounted for only 1.9 percent of the total population, owned 63 percent of the total paddy fields of 11,436 mu, 12.3 percent of the total garden land of 5,688 mu, 11.8 percent of the total irrigated land of 36,388 mu, and 18.8 percent of the total dry land of 276,012 mu. On the other hand, poor peasants and farm laborers, who accounted for 39.6 percent of the total population, owned only 14.3 percent of the total land area and 0.5 percent of the paddy fields. During the land reform, a total of 127,456 mu of land was confiscated from landlords and requisitioned from rich peasants' leased land. Together with the original public land, 42 percent (142,081 mu) of all cultivated land in the 74 villages has been nationalized. Subsequently, the right to use the land was reasonably allocated. The land distributed to poor peasants and farm laborers for use is roughly equivalent to the average. Of the 16,127 mu of land for which farm laborers obtained the right to use, approximately one-quarter (4,043 mu) is paddy fields, garden land, and irrigated land. These poor peasants and farm laborers were also allocated nearly 600,000 jin of grain (converted to corn), 290 waterwheels, 357 carts, 493 head of livestock, 7,644 rooms of housing, and many general agricultural tools. In addition to the indirect income from unpaid rent last year, their production and living conditions have been greatly improved. (There are currently no comprehensive statistics for the second batch of land reform villages, but the situation is basically the same.)
            Corrections of deviations were swift and timely, so no major errors occurred.
    Due to the good ideological and organizational preparation of cadres and the masses (on the cadre side, from the promulgation of land reform measures by the Municipal Military Control Commission at the end of May last year to the start of large-scale land reform at the end of October, there were five full months of document study and some experimental work; on the mass side, before land reform, there had been struggles against pseudo-bao-jia, anti-corruption, anti-local bullies, and wage increases, with preliminary class awakening, and the widespread organization of farmers' associations), close relations between upper and lower levels, tight leadership from the Suburban Committee, and the ability to quickly correct deviations within one or two days (convenient transportation), greater achievements were made in a shorter period of time (four months); there were also no chaotic phenomena such as digging up hidden wealth or acts of infringing on industry and commerce. Many complex issues in land relations and class relations in the suburbs were correctly resolved. For example, many people in the city owned land and property in the suburbs, including people from all walks of life, and their class status had to be determined before their land could be dealt with. These issues were generally resolved properly after cadres and the masses invited the individuals involved to discuss them. For charitable organizations etc. that owned land and property in the suburbs, on the one hand, their production and life were taken care of, and necessary land was retained; on the other hand, the large amounts of land they irrationally occupied (mostly rented out) were confiscated and distributed to farmers for use. Confiscation has also been prepared for foreigners who own large tracts of land in the suburbs and rent them out. Such as the International Golf Course in Shijingshan, and the leased land of the Italian Verigena in the western suburbs. In order to ensure that agricultural production is not adversely affected, gardens and orchards that require specialized knowledge to operate and cannot be divided, as well as cultivated land with advanced equipment, will continue to be used by the original users. Some farmers hoped to divide the vegetable gardens cultivated by landlords' hired laborers, but they were persuaded and educated to understand the reasons for not dividing them.
            Farmers support land nationalization and are prepared to increase grain production and live a good life.
    According to investigations and understandings over the past four months, farmers in the suburbs support the policy of land nationalization. They said: If the state can build factories on these lands, we can go to work in factories. The state's income is large, and our income is also better than farming (many people in the suburbs work in factories, and their lives are better than those of farmers). In addition, they believe that the policy of land nationalization is of positive significance for transforming landlords and transforming rogue loafers, enabling them to turn to labor production. Because the ownership of land is with the state, whoever does not cultivate it well can have it taken back. In terms of burden, the state does not want rent like landlords, but only collects agricultural tax, which is the same as when farmers own land. Farmers now understand these situations, so their production enthusiasm is very high. A farmer in the western suburbs said: Now there are more people picking up manure than defecating. In particular, farmers have been allocated a lot of paddy fields and water fields (in the past, landlords and bureaucrats occupied most of the good land), and they all hope to lay the foundation for future production and life through a good harvest (a mu of good paddy field can yield three dan of rice), so those who drank alcohol no longer drink, those who liked to eat good food no longer eat it, and gambling has been greatly reduced, and many restaurants have begun to decline. Some farm laborers have married and started families for the first time in their lives, and both their production enthusiasm and living standards are improving.

### 京郊两批村庄完成土改  农民生产情绪提高  最后六十余村土改亦已开始

　　京郊两批村庄完成土改
    农民生产情绪提高         
    最后六十余村土改亦已开始
    【本报讯】北京郊区土地改革工作，截至二十五日止，已有一百七十六村胜利完成。其中包括八个试验村及第一批土改村庄七十四个，第二批土改村庄九十四个（第二批共一○二村，最后八村数日内可结束）。第三批六十四村的土改工作，亦已正式开始。
            土改使阶级关系起了根本变化。
    第一、二批村庄土地改革的结果，使京郊土地关系与阶级关系起了根本的变化。以第一批七十四个土改村庄说，土改前，地主、经营地主与旧式富农共占人口总数一三九五六二的百分之八点六，占有土地却达土地总数三三四三一一亩的百分之四三点二。只占人口总数百分之一点九的地主，竟占有稻田总数一一四三六亩的百分之六三，园地总数五六八八亩的百分之十二点三，水浇地总数三六三八八亩的百分之十一点八，旱地总数二七六○一二亩的百分之十八点八。另一方面，占人口总数百分之三九点六的贫农与雇农，却只占有土地总数的百分之十四点三，占有稻地的百分之零点五。土地改革中没收地主土地与征收富农出租土地，计一二七、四五六亩。连同原有公地合计，七十四村全部耕地的百分之四十二（一四二○八一亩）已归国有。并接着实行了使用权的合理分配。分给贫农雇农使用的土地，已大致相当于平均数。雇农分得使用权的一六一二七亩土地中，约有四分之一（四○四三亩）是稻田、园地与水浇地。这些贫苦农民并分得粮食近六十万斤（折玉米），水车二九○辆，大车三五七辆，耕畜四九三头，房屋七六四四间及许多一般农具。再加上去年未交租的间接收入，其生产与生活条件已大为改善。（第二批土改村庄目前尚无全面的统计数字，但情况亦基本相同。）
            纠正偏向迅速及时，故未发生大的错误。
    由于干部与群众在思想上、组织上有较好的准备（干部方面，从去年五月底市军管会发布土改办法到十月底开始大规模土改工作，经过整五个月的文件学习与若干实验工作；群众方面，土改前已经过反伪保甲、反贪污、反恶霸、增加工资等斗争，有了初步的阶级觉醒，并普遍组织了农会），上下级关系密切，郊委会领导抓得紧，出了偏向能于一、二日内迅速纠正（交通方便），所以能在较短时间（四个月）内做出较大的成绩；亦未发生挖底财等混乱现象及侵犯工商业的行为。并正确地解决了郊区土地关系与阶级关系中许多复杂的问题。如城内有许多人在郊区占有土地财产，其中包括各行各业的人，都须先确定其成份，才能处理其土地。而这些问题都经干部与群众将其本人请来商讨，一般获得妥善的解决。有些慈善机关等在郊区占有土地财产者，一方面照顾其生产与生活，留给必要的土地；一方面将其不合理地占有的大量土地（多出租）实行没收，分给农民使用。有些外国人在郊区占有大量土地出租的，也已准备予以没收。如石景山的万国高尔夫球场，西郊义大利人维立根那的出租土地等。为了保证对农业生产不发生坏的影响，菜园、果园等需有专门知识才能经营的不可分割的园艺，以及有进步设备的耕地，都仍归原使用者使用。有些农民希望分割地主雇工耕种之菜园，都经说服教育，弄清了不分的道理。
            农民拥护土地国有，都准备增产粮食，过好光景。
    根据四个月来的调查了解，郊区农民对土地国有的政策是拥护的。他们说：如果国家能在这些土地上建立工厂，我们就能进工厂作工。国家收入大，我们的收入也比务农多（郊区有许多人在工厂做工，生活都比农民为好）。另外，他们认为土地国有的政策对于改造地主，改造流氓懒汉，使其转入劳动生产，是有积极意义的。因为土地所有权在国家，谁不好好种就可以收回。就负担说，国家又不像地主一样要租子，只是收农业税，在这一点上，和农民自有土地是一样的。这些情形，农民现在均已了解，所以他们的生产情绪很高。西郊一个农民说：现在拾粪的比拉屎的多。特别是农民分得稻田水田很多（过去地主官僚们占的多是好地），都希望经过一次好的收成就打下今后生产与生活的基础（好稻田一亩能收三石大米），所以喝酒的不喝了，好吃的不吃了，嫖赌现象也大大减少，不少饭铺开始萧条。雇农们有的已生平第一次地娶妻成家，生产热情和生活的水平都在提高着。
