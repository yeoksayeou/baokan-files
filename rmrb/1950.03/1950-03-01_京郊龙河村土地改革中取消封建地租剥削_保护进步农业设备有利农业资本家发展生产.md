[Report from Our Newspaper] According to materials obtained by our reporter in Longhe Village, Fourteenth District, southern suburbs of Beijing, land reform will have a positive impact on the production of agricultural capitalists. This is because it eliminates the exploitation of feudal land rent while retaining the right to use all progressive equipment and the land cultivated using progressive equipment.

Most of Longhe Village consists of rice paddies, all irrigated with well water. Most of the agricultural capitalists in the village use power engines, electric rollers, electric wells, rice threshers, rice hullers, rice milling machines, and other advanced facilities for cultivation. Some of the better-managed ones also possess scientific agricultural knowledge and production techniques. For example, the agricultural capitalist Li Shuji selects seeds, raises seedlings, and studies pest control every year in rice cultivation, and often reads agricultural books and magazines. He is the best managed in the surrounding villages, and his rice harvest is also the highest.

Li Shuji's family has eight people, owning 31 mu of paddy fields and 20 mu of dry land, and renting in 315 mu of paddy fields and 15 mu of dry land. His farming facilities include: one electric well, 25 artesian wells, four iron waterwheels, six electric rollers (three for pumping water, three for driving other machines), one water pump, and a complete set of machines for threshing, hulling, and milling rice, five mules, and two large carts. He employs 14 workers for land cultivation, and another 8,000 temporary workers (short-term workers) are used each year. His cultivation situation is: machines are used for watering and dehusking and milling rice after the rice harvest, and all other work is done manually. He also runs a sideline flour mill, in which the electric water mill, suction machine, and wind bellows (replacing the bellows) are all relatively modern tools.

During the land reform, the ownership of the land rented in by Li Shuji was nationalized, and all the land he cultivated with machines was retained for his use. All of his machines, livestock, and farm implements were also left untouched. The Farmers' Association initially planned to extract his dry land that was not cultivated with machines for distribution to the peasants. However, because these dry lands were scattered in small pieces among the paddy fields, it was difficult for the peasants to cultivate them after distribution, so the dry land was not touched either.

In total, there are eleven agricultural capitalist households in the village, with a total of 62 people, renting in 981 mu of paddy fields, 776.5 mu of dry land, and 0.8 mu of garden land. They own 31 mu of paddy fields, 189 mu of dry land, and 12.2 mu of garden land. Their farming implements include four electric wells, 88 artesian wells, 13 electric rollers, 12 rice hulling and milling machines, six iron waterwheels, 11 wooden waterwheels, eight large carts, 19 mules, one horse, and one cow. The ownership of their rented land was nationalized. In addition, 129 mu of paddy fields, 796.5 mu of dry land, and 0.8 mu of garden land that were not originally cultivated with machines were extracted and distributed to the peasants for use.

Agricultural capitalists no longer need to pay land rent for cultivating state-owned land in the future. They only need to pay a unified agricultural tax to the state. In the past, each mu of paddy field could yield about 400 catties of rice per year, and about 200 catties had to be paid to the landlord as rent; this year, paying agricultural tax plus progressive tax, the maximum is only over one hundred catties of millet. This makes it possible for agricultural capitalists to invest more of their surplus in production in the future.

### 京郊龙河村土地改革中取消封建地租剥削  保护进步农业设备有利农业资本家发展生产

　　京郊龙河村土地改革中取消封建地租剥削
    保护进步农业设备有利农业资本家发展生产
    【本报讯】根据记者在北京南郊十四区龙河村所获材料，土地改革对农业资本家的生产将发生好的影响。因为它取消了封建地租的剥削，而保留了一切进步设备与使用进步设备所耕种的土地的使用权。
    龙河村大部分是稻田，全用井水浇灌。该村的农业资本家大部分使用动力机、电滚子、电井、打稻机、砻稻机、碾米机等进步设施进行耕种。有些经营较好的，本人还具有科学的农业知识和生产技术。如农业资本家力树基，种稻中每年自行选种，养苗，研究害虫的防治，并常阅读农业书籍和杂志。在附近一带村庄，他经营最好，稻子的收获量也是最高的。
    力树基全家八口人，自有水地三十一亩、旱地二十亩，租入水地三百一十五亩、旱地十五亩。他的耕作设施有：电井一个、自流井二十五个、铁水车四辆、电滚子六个（三个抽水，三个带动其他机器）、水泵一个，另有打稻、砻稻、碾米等一套机器，骡子五头、大车两辆。土地耕种上雇十四个工人，每年另用临时工（短工）八千个。其耕种情形是：浇水和稻子收割后的去壳、碾米用机器，其他全用人工。他还经营有副业粉房一座，其中所用的电力水磨、吸水机、风胡芦（代风箱）等，也都是较现代化的工具。
    土地改革中，力树基租入的土地所有权收归国有，其用机器耕种之土地，仍全部留其使用。其所有之机器、牲畜、农具亦全部未动。农会初拟抽出其不用机器耕种的旱地，分配给农民使用。后因这些旱地都是零碎地散插在水地中间，分配后农民很难耕种，故旱地亦未抽动。
    总计该村共有农业资本家十一户，共六十二口人，租入水地九百八十一亩、旱地七百七十六亩半、园地八分。自有水地三十一亩、旱地一百八十九亩、园地十二亩二分。耕作用具共有电井四眼、自流井八十八眼、电滚子十三个、砻稻、碾米等机器十二个、铁水车六个、木水车十一个、大车八辆、骡子十九头、马一头、牛一头。其租入之土地，所有权收归国有。并抽出原非使用机器耕种的水地一百二十九亩、旱地七百九十六亩半、园地八分，分配给农民使用。
    农业资本家今后耕种国家的土地，已不需再交地租。只需向国家交纳统一的农业税。过去每亩水地每年约可收四百斤大米，给地主交租需二百斤左右；今年交农业税加上累进，多者不过小米百余斤。这就使农业资本家今后有可能以更多的剩余投入生产。
