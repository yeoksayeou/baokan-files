[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The spring tree planting and afforestation work in Beijing has been largely completed. In order to implement the spring afforestation instructions of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, and to seize the time to plant before budding to improve the survival rate, the Municipal Construction Bureau began planting trees along roads and river embankments and afforestation work in mid-March. As of now, more than 70,000 trees have been planted. This tree planting is mainly coordinated with this year's river dredging and road projects of the Sanitation Engineering Bureau to consolidate embankments and roadbeds. It is estimated that 50,000 willows have been planted in Jinhai and Changhe Rivers, 850 willows have been planted along the moat of the front three gates from Dongbianmen to Chongwenmen and from Xuanwumen to Xibianmen, and 1,018 willows have been planted along the Shichahai. A total of 3,500 new trees have been planted on Xuanwai Street, East Chang'an Street, and Qipan Street, and along Jingshan East Street and Fuxingmenwai Road. In addition, more than 22,000 trees have been planted independently by government agencies, troops, and schools with seedlings supplied by the Construction Bureau. In order to further develop the work of planting trees and afforestation, the Construction Bureau has decided to expand the existing nurseries and implement a plan to cultivate 700,000 seedlings by means of seed collection, division of roots, grafting, etc. The types of seedlings include dozens of species such as locust, poplar, willow, and French parasol trees. Since forest protection work is as important as afforestation work, the Construction Bureau has ordered its responsible departments to strengthen maintenance work and pay attention to watering; and called on citizens not to break branches, shake trees, or hang or build things on trees, and to conscientiously protect trees.
