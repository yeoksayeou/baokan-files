　　Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit troops fleeing into French-occupied areas of Vietnam and participating in French military operations to invade Vietnamese liberated areas have been severely decimated by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army. According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch from central Vietnam on March 7th, the Vietnam Headquarters issued a communique stating that the armed forces of the Republic of Vietnam, while repelling French troops in the Nauben area of Quang Nam Province, captured approximately 30 Kuomintang soldiers. Prior to this, the remnants of the 100th Army of the 17th Army Corps of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, having fled to Ping Meng in northern Vietnam on January 9th, attempted to join the French army in Cao Bang but were resisted by Viet Minh forces at Soc Giang. On the 10th, the bandits ravaged villages near Soc Giang and were wiped out by Viet Minh forces on the 11th and 12th, with over 130 killed. On the 14th, the bandits continued their southward flight, pursued by Viet Minh forces to Mei O, and 300 were eliminated at Na Duong. A dispatch from the Vietnam News Agency on the 11th stated that the Viet Minh Army Headquarters communique indicated that over 4,000 Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits infiltrating the Cao Bang region had been eliminated within a month, starting from January 9th. Furthermore, in operations in Quang Nam Province, Viet Minh forces seized secret documents containing detailed plans for cooperation between the Chinese Kuomintang army and the French army in the Sino-Vietnamese border region. These facts demonstrate that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops fleeing into Vietnam have not only not been disarmed or detained but have also been exploited by the French authorities as cannon fodder, directly participating in the French imperialist colonial army's war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    遭受越南解放军痛歼
    侵入高平地区之匪一个月被歼四千余
    【新华社十六日讯】逃入越南法占区的国民党匪军参加法军作战侵犯越南解放区，已受到越南人民解放军的痛歼。据越南通讯社越南中部七日电称：越南总部发表公报称：越南共和国武装部队在广南省阮区（Nauben）的南沼（Nachau）湾击退法军时，俘获国民党士兵约三十名。在此以前，国民党匪军十七兵团一百军残部于一月九日窜抵越北平孟，企图去高平与法军会合，至朔江为越盟军抗击。十日该匪在朔江附近各村肆虐，被越盟军于十一、十二两日歼灭一百三十余名。十四日匪继续南窜，被越盟军追击至梅哦，并于那阳被歼三百名。越南通讯社十一日电越盟军总部公报称：侵入高平地区的国民党残匪在自一月九日起的一个月内已歼灭四千余名。又在广南省的作战中，越盟军曾缴获载有中国国民党军与法军在中越边境地区合作之详尽计划的秘密文件。这些事实都说明逃入越境的国民党匪军不但未被解除武装或拘禁，而且被法国当局利用作炮灰，直接地参加了法国帝国主义的殖民军对越南人民共和国的侵略作战。
