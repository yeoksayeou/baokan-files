　　Winter Vacation Youth Study Organizations Conclude Sessions
    [From Our Newspaper] The winter vacation youth lectures and school Youth League cadre study sessions organized by the Beijing Winter Vacation Youth Work Committee during the two weeks around the Spring Festival have concluded successively. The arts and literature study session held a closing party on February 27th. The winter vacation youth lectures were held 51 times in five districts, with a total of over 53,000 participants. Through the lectures and small group discussions, students gained a further understanding of the spirit of internationalism and patriotism and their relationship, as well as Sino-Soviet friendship. The lectures also strengthened the view of science serving the people and the ability to critically accept works of art and literature from a class perspective.

    The large and middle school Youth League cadre study sessions were attended by over 1,000 cadres and party member cadres from the branches of the League in each school, as well as over 100 political teachers from middle schools. Peng Zhen, Feng Wenbin, Gu Dachuan, Yang Shu, Xu Liqun, and others gave reports on the situation and tasks for 1950, the tasks of the school Youth League, how to consolidate the relationship between the Party and the masses, the propaganda and education work of the Youth League, and how to carry out school Youth League work.

    The arts and literature study session was divided into lectures and vocational training classes. The lecture section was attended by more than 700 core members of cultural and recreational activities from universities and middle schools, as well as music, art, and physical education teachers from primary and secondary schools. In addition, the music lectures organized by more than 200 primary and secondary school music teachers included three lectures by Jin Ziguang on Soviet music education and Du Yijia on folk songs. The vocational training class organized more than 230 university and middle school students who participated in the arts and literature lectures to study art and literature theory and techniques, significantly improving students' understanding of art and literature and the level of art and literature theory and work, and initially clarifying the basic guidelines and tasks of school cultural and recreational activities. The vocational training class was divided into drama, music, and dance groups, and listened to ten reports on playwriting, directing, and stage knowledge, simple conducting methods, Yangko dance, and school cultural and recreational activities and creation issues. The groups held discussions and conducted more than 20 internships.

    A lecture for primary school teacher League members was held once, with He Li, the head of the Children's Department of the Central Committee of the League, speaking on several issues related to the work of the Young Pioneers. Due to the busy winter vacation studies of primary school teachers, other reports are planned to be continued after the start of the school year. (Youth)

    【本报讯】北京市寒假青年工作委员会在春节前后的两周间所组织的寒假青年讲座、学校青年团干部学习会业已先后结束，文艺学习会并于二月二十七日举行了结业联欢。寒假青年讲座在五区共举行五十一次，参加听讲总人数约计五万三千余人。通过讲座和小组的漫谈、讨论，使同学们对国际主义与爱国主义的精神和它们的关系，以及中苏友好有了进一步的认识，并加强了科学为人民服务的观点，和用阶级观点来批判接受文艺作品的能力。
    大、中学青年团干部学习会各有学校团的分支委以上干部及党员干部千余人、中学且有政治教员百余人参加。由彭真、冯文彬、顾大川、杨述、许立群等分别报告一九五○年的形势与任务、学校青年团的任务、如何巩固党与群众的联系、青年团的宣教工作、怎样搞学校团的工作等问题。
    文艺学习会分讲座与业务学习班两部分：讲座部分有大中学文娱活动的骨干分子及中小学音乐、美术、体育教员等七百余人参加。此外，二百余中小学音乐教员组织的音乐讲座，有金紫光的苏联的音乐教育，和杜矢甲的民歌讲座三次。业务学习班组织了参加文艺讲座的大中学同学二百三十余人，进行文艺理论和技术的学习，显著提高了同学们对文艺的认识和文艺理论与工作的水平，初步明确了学校文娱活动的基本方针和任务。业务学习班分戏剧、音乐、舞蹈三组，分别听了编剧、排演和舞台常识，简易指挥法，秧歌以及学校文艺活动和创作的问题等十次报告。各小组进行了讨论并作了二十余次实习。
    小学教员团员讲座曾举行一次，由团中央少年儿童部长何礼讲有关少年儿童队工作的几个问题。因小学教员寒假学习繁忙，其他报告拟于开学后继续举行。   （青）
