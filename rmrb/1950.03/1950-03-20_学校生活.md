　　New Life Middle School

　　School Life
　　Mongolian and Tibetan School
　　In terms of studies, the National Mongolian and Tibetan School has always had one more Mongolian and Tibetan language course than ordinary schools. In the past, students were too busy to cope. However, with the elimination of English this semester, students are actively learning their own Mongolian language. (Mongolian and Tibetan School Correspondence Group)
　　After hearing the people's government's call to continue saving grain to aid disaster relief on the afternoon of the 14th, the student union of the National Mongolian and Tibetan School immediately initiated a signature campaign to save grain for disaster relief, and everyone signed. It was decided to continue saving two liang of millet per day. Teachers will also extend the grain-saving period to the end of June. (Mongolian and Tibetan School Correspondence Group)
　　Boys' No. 1 Middle School
　　The Youth League General Branch of Boys' No. 1 Middle School recently held a re-election. At 1:00 PM on the 14th, the General Branch convened an expanded cadre meeting to convey the specific methods and significance of this re-election. On the 15th, the General Branch issued a letter to all League members, students, and teachers, hoping that all teachers and students would offer suggestions for improvement in the spirit of cherishing the League. The re-election of the General Branch was held in the auditorium at 4:00 PM on the 17th.
　　Furthermore, 529 teachers and students of No. 1 Middle School have signed up to participate in amateur agricultural production, accounting for more than 87% of the total number of students in the school. (Municipal No. 1 Middle School Correspondence Group)
　　Boys' No. 2 Middle School
　　Teachers and students of Municipal Boys' No. 2 Middle School warmly support the government's call for "spare-time production to improve living standards." A No. 2 Middle School Production Committee was formed, with the principal as chairman and the director of general affairs as vice-chairman, under which there are three departments: the planning department, the organization department, and the general affairs department. On the morning of the 13th, the Production Committee sent personnel to inspect the land outside Chaoyangmen. Production will begin as soon as the land division is determined.

　　In addition, Boys' No. 2 Middle School is fully preparing for air defense work. The Air Defense Committee has been formally established, with six groups: fire fighting, stretcher-bearing, first aid, light control, signaling, and security liaison. More than 20 fire extinguishing bombs, air defense buckets, air defense sand, and other air defense equipment have been prepared. Students used their spare time and physical education time to dig thirty-three air raid shelters. They also glued glass and installed electric light air defense covers.
　　The student union also put out a special air defense issue of the blackboard newspaper. On the 8th, all teachers and students of the school held a large-scale drill. On the 14th, a nighttime air defense organization was established. (Bao Chen)
　　New Life Middle School
　　The General Branch of the Youth League of New Life Middle School No. 1 Courtyard has changed to a three-level leadership system starting this semester, expanding the original General Branch into a League Committee, and establishing two General Branch Committees in the boys' school and the girls' school. This decision was made because the League's development work expanded rapidly last semester, with the number of League members increasing from 88 to 550, and the number of branches expanding from 8 to 25. The two-level system of the General Branch directly leading the branches not only failed to fully take care of the work of each branch but also formed a chaotic phenomenon in work style. The re-election of the League Committee and the General Branches will be completed within this week.

　　In addition, New Life Middle School has established an air defense headquarters, with the headquarters located in the boys' school of No. 1 Courtyard, and command sub-departments in the girls' school and No. 2 Courtyard, under which there are three brigades: first aid, security, and fire fighting, and a liaison group. Dean of Studies Zhu Dan explained the significance and need for air defense to the students and reminded them to remain calm in case of emergency. (Guan Yi)
　　Municipal No. 4 Middle School
　　March 15th was the first anniversary of the takeover of Municipal No. 4 Middle School. In order to summarize the work in all aspects over the past year and to celebrate the "rejuvenation and reconstruction" of No. 4 Middle School, a celebration meeting was held on that day.
　　In his speech, Principal Li Fusheng pointed out that, thanks to the correct leadership of the people's government after the takeover, the greatest characteristic of No. 4 Middle School was formed: the unity of all teachers and students; everyone cherishing public interests; and striving for the regularization of the school. Representatives from the labor union, the Youth League, students, and workers spoke successively. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The Soviet war film "The Great Turning Point" was screened in the school auditorium at 7:00 PM.
　　(No. 4 Middle School Correspondence Group)
　　Fu Ren Middle School
　　The General Branch of the Youth League of Fu Ren Middle School held a conference on the 15th to review past work, determine future improvement directions, and re-elect the General Branch. The chairman made a report and review of the work of the General Branch over the past six months and called on League members to closely contact teachers and the broad masses of students, sincerely accept criticisms and suggestions, and correct their mistakes. In order to further clarify the work and tasks for the first half of this year for League members, Comrade Zheng Meirong from the Municipal Workers' Committee was invited to give a relevant report. The re-election of the General Branch is now being planned, and an election meeting will be held on the 17th.
　　(Fu Zhong Correspondence Group, Liu Bolin writing)
　　Hebei High School
　　Hebei High School is actively establishing air defense facilities. The school bought two fire extinguishers, four large water tanks, and added faucets. Students are more actively digging air raid shelters, making sandbags, and pasting paper strips on glass. In order to strengthen the organization of anti-banditry, anti-special forces, and air defense, ten people including representatives from the student union, the faculty and staff union, and the Party and League General Branch formed a preparatory committee for the "Security Committee." The command of the committee is further divided into three groups: security, first aid, and liaison.
　　(Correspondence Group, Liu Jun)
　　Hui Wen Middle School
　　Hui Wen Middle School has quickly entered normal study since the start of the school year. In order to better study the regular courses, many classes have spontaneously formed various research groups. After class, they gather to discuss problems, and the undergraduate instructors also frequently participate in guidance, which is of great help to learning.
　　In addition, a Russian language class has been added this semester, and the students who signed up for elective courses are quite enthusiastic. According to statistics, there are nearly 300 people.

　　学校生活
    蒙藏学校
    国立蒙藏学校在功课方面，比一般学校一向是多一门蒙藏文的。过去，闹得同学们都忙不过来。但在这学期取消了英文，同学们都积极学习自己的蒙文了。（蒙藏学校通联组）
    国立蒙藏学校于十四日下午听到人民政府继续节米救灾的号召后，学生会立刻发起签名节米救灾，结果无一不签者。决定每日继续节约小米二两。教师们并将节米时间延长至六月底。（蒙藏学校通联组）
    男一中
    青年团男一中总支部近日进行改选。十四日下午一点总支召集一次扩大干部会议，传达了这次改选的具体办法及意义，十五日总支发表了告全体团员、同学、教师书，希望全体老师、同学，本着爱护团的精神提出改进的意见。十七日下午四时在大礼堂进行改选总支部。
    又，一中师生报名参加业余农业生产的已有五二九人，占全校总人数的百分之八十七强。（市立一中通讯组）
    男二中
    市立男二中师生热烈拥护政府关于“课余生产，改善生活”的号召。并组成二中生产委员会，校长任主席，总务主任任副主席，下设三个部门：计划部，组织部，总务部。十三日早晨，生产委员会曾派专人赴朝阳门外察看了土地，一俟土地划分确定，即可开始生产。
        （男二中通讯组宝臣）
    又，男二中充分准备防空工作。防空委员会已正式成立，下设消防、担架、救护、灯火管制、信号、纠察联络等六组。并准备了二十多枚消火弹、防空桶、防空沙等大量防空设备。同学们利用课余、体育时间，挖了三十三个防空壕，粘玻璃、装电灯防空罩等工作也做好了。
    学生会也配合出了防空专号黑板报。八日，全校师生作了一次大演习。十四日又成立了夜间防空组织。（宝臣）
    新生中学
    青年团新生中学一院总支部自本学期起改为三级领导制度，将原有总支部扩大为团委员会，并在男校女校成立两个总支委员会。这一决定是由于上学期团的发展工作迅速开展，团员由八十八人增加到五百五十人，分支也由八个扩充到二十五个，总支直接领导分支的二级制度，不但不能充分照顾到每个分支的工作，且在工作作风上也形成忙乱现象。团委会和总支的改选工作，将在本周内完成。
      （新生中学通讯组冠一）
    又，新生中学成立防空指挥部，总部设在一院男校，女校和二院设指挥分部，下设救护，纠查、消防，三个大队和一个联络组。教导主任朱丹曾向同学解释防空的意义和需要，并提醒同学遇事千万要镇定。（冠一）
    市立四中
    三月十五日是市立四中接管一周年纪念日。为了总结一年来各方面的工作，并庆祝四中的“回春再造”，特于当日举行庆祝大会。
    校长李复生讲话中指出，接管后由于人民政府的正确领导，促成了四中的最大特色：全校师生团结一致；人人爱护公共利益；为学校的正规化而努力。工会、青年团、学生、工友等代表均相继讲话，五时散会。晚七时在本校礼堂放映苏联战争名片《伟大的转折》。
    （四中通讯组）
    辅仁中学
    青年团辅仁中学总支部，为检讨已往的工作，确定今后的改进方针和总支部的改选，特在十五日召开大会。主席对半年来团总支部的工作，做了报告和检讨，并号召团员密切联系老师和广大的同学，诚恳地接受批评和建议，以纠正自己的错误。为进一步使团员明了今年上半年的工作和任务，特邀请了市工委郑美荣同志做了有关报告。总支部的改选工作，现已开始筹划，定十七日召开选举大会。

    河北高中
    河北高中正积极建立防空设备。学校里买了两个灭火器，四个大水缸，添了水龙头，同学们更积极挖防空壕，做砂袋，剪纸条糊玻璃等。为了加强防匪防特和防空的组织，学生会、教职员工会、党、团总支代表等十人组成了“安全委员会”筹备会，该会指挥部下又设纠察、救护、联络等三组。
    （通讯组刘钧）
    汇文中学
    汇文中学开学以来已迅速进入正常学习。同学们为了把正课学习的更好，不少班已自发地组成各种钻研小组。下课后他们便召集一起研讨问题，本科教员也经常参加指导，对学习帮助很大。
    又，本学期增设了俄文班，签名选修的同学颇为踊跃，据统计，将近三百人。
