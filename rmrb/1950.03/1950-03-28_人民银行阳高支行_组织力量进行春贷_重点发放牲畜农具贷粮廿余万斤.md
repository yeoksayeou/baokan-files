　　Yanggao Branch of the People's Bank
    Organizes Efforts for Spring Loans
    Focusing on Issuing Over 200,000 Jin of Grain for Livestock and Farm Implements
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Yanggao Branch of the People's Bank has established agricultural loan institutions and is issuing livestock loans in conjunction with the collection of old agricultural loans. On March 16th, the branch held a cadre meeting. Based on past lessons learned from issuing agricultural loans, and to prevent biases such as administrative allocation, rush issuance, charitable relief, and average distribution from occurring, it was stipulated that this year's agricultural loans must genuinely understand the actual situation and needs of the districts, villages, and households, and loans must be issued according to production plans. Of the county's 200,000 jin of loan grain, the focus will be on issuing loans in the fourth, sixth, seventh, and tenth districts, and the loan recipients will be the working masses who are actively engaged in production but lack draught animals and funds. In the loan issuance work, a formal loan issuance system must be established, and the usage of loans by borrowers must be checked at any time. In accordance with the above spirit, the branch established two business offices in Zhaoshizhuang in the sixth district and Sanguantun in the third district in mid-March to handle loan work in various districts and villages. At the same time, ten cadres were transferred to form two groups to work in the sixth and seventh districts, which are key areas for livestock loans, to assist in the issuance work. Together with the 11,351 jin of expired old loan grain recovered, a total of 20,610 jin of grain has been loaned to 49 households. Combined with 8,010 jin of private capital, 49 additional draught animals have been acquired. Because the branch has stopped urban lending work, and its business is relatively idle, a large number of cadres have been transferred to various districts and villages to actively distribute 200,000 jin of livestock loan grain, so that the masses can obtain draught power in time for spring plowing.

    In addition, on March 3rd, the bank, through the county supply and marketing cooperative, issued 65,000 jin of grain for farm implements to purchase and manufacture farm tools. A total of 1,000 iron shovels, 2,000 plowshares, 2,000 seeder shovels, 150 plow surfaces, and 858 large hoe blades have been purchased. The branch is organizing forces to promote sales and study credit sales methods. (Yanggao Branch Correspondence Group, Li Pu)

　　人民银行阳高支行
    组织力量进行春贷
    重点发放牲畜农具贷粮廿余万斤
    【本报讯】人民银行阳高支行，设立农贷机构，结合催收旧农贷，发放牲畜贷款。该支行于三月十六日召开干部会议，根据以往发放农贷教训，为防止行政分配、突击发放、恩赐救济、平均使用等偏向发生。规定今年农贷必须确实了解区村户实际情形及需要，按照生产计划贷款。全县二十万斤贷粮有重点的出贷，确定以四、六、七、十区为重点区，贷款对象为积极从事生产，缺乏耕畜资金的劳动群众。在发放贷款工作中，必须建立正规贷放制度，随时检查贷户使用情况，根据以上精神，该支行于三月中旬设立六区赵石庄及三区三官屯两营业所，办理各区、村贷款工作。同时抽调干部十人组织两个组，到六、七两牲畜贷款重点区，协同进行发放工作。连同收回的到期旧贷粮一一、三五一斤，共贷粮二○、六一○斤给四十九户，结合私资八○一○斤，已增加耕畜四九头。因支行停止城市放款工作，业务较闲，故又抽出大批干部转到各区村，积极进行发放二十万斤牲畜贷粮，以便让群众能及时获得畜力进行春耕。
    又该行曾于三月三日通过县供销合作社，发放农具贷粮六五、○○○斤购制农具。计已购得铁锹一千张，犁铧二千条，耧铧二千条，犁面一五○个，大锄板八五八个。支行正组织力量推销与研究赊贷办法。（阳高支行通讯组李朴）
