Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th: The Malayan National Liberation Army responded to the Malayan British colonial authorities' decision to declare February as the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" with a series of counterattacks.

According to reports from British and American news agencies: On February 23rd, the Malayan National Liberation Army attacked a police station in Johor, killing 13 British military police and wounding 7. On March 2nd, the Liberation Army ambushed a British military escort team at the junction of Selangor, Perak, and Pahang states, killing 5 British military police. On the 7th, the Liberation Army ambushed a British army truck in the Kedah area, killing three British officers and three "volunteers," and the truck was burned. During this period, the Liberation Army also attacked trains between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur several times.

After the British High Commissioner in Malaya, Gurney, announced February as the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" at the Legislative Council, the British colonial authorities began to forcibly conscript Malayan people to participate in the so-called "Volunteer Army," including doctors, teachers, clerks, and technicians; even dancers and waitresses were among those conscripted. Recently, the number of conscripts has increased from 352,000 to 420,000. They were incorporated into police auxiliary teams, replacing the duties of military police in the rear, so that more police could be transferred to engage in operations against the guerrillas. On February 26th, this group of "volunteers" formally "enlisted." In addition, the British colonial authorities have intensified the food blockade of the guerrilla areas, restricted the free transportation of food in British-occupied areas, prohibited "unnecessary" travel, and cancelled the temporary leave system for employees of government agencies. On February 21st, 1,500 British troops arrived in Singapore from Britain as "reinforcements."

However, all of this has not improved the situation of the British colonial authorities. The Singapore Straits Times, the mouthpiece of the British colonial authorities, stated in an editorial on the 9th that the recent series of attacks by the guerrillas is "sufficient proof that the guerrillas' counterattack in the 'Anti-Bandit Month' has matured." The editorial also said, "As the current situation develops, it is impossible to stop the state of emergency." This indicates another failure of the British colonialists' scheme to intensify the suppression of the Malayan people.

### 马来亚解放军不断出击  英帝“反匪月”阴谋连遭失败

　　马来亚解放军不断出击
    英帝“反匪月”阴谋连遭失败
    【新华社北京十三日电】马来亚民族解放军曾以一连串的反击行动，来答复马来亚英殖民当局宣布以二月作为所谓“反匪月”的决定。
    据英美通讯社消息：二月二十三日，马来亚民族解放军曾袭击柔佛州内一警察所，击毙英国军警十三名，击伤七名。本月二日，解放军在雪兰莪、霹雳和彭亨三州交界处，伏击了英国军事护送队，击毙英国军警五名。七日，解放军复在吉打地方伏击一部英军卡车，三个英国军官和三个“志愿兵”被击毙，卡车则被焚毁。在此期间，解放军并曾数度袭击新加坡、吉隆坡间的火车。
    英驻马来亚高级专员格尔奈在立法会议上宣布二月为所谓“反匪月”后，英殖民当局即开始强迫征调马来亚人民参加所谓“志愿军”，其中包括医生、教员、职员及技术人员，甚至舞女与女招待也在被征调之列。最近被征调的人数已由三十五万二千增到四十二万。他们被编人警察辅助队，代替后方军警的职务，以便能抽调更多警察，从事对游击队的作战。二月二十六日，这批“志愿军”正式“入伍”。此外，英殖民当局还加紧对游击区的粮食封锁，限制英占区的粮食自由运输，禁止“不必要”的旅行，并取消机关雇员的临时请假制度。上月二十一日，并有英军一千五百名由英国开抵新加坡“增援”。
    然而，这一切并没有使英国殖民地当局的处境稍为好些。英殖民当局喉舌的新加坡海峡时报九日社论认为，近来游击队一系列的出击，是游击队在“反匪月”的反击“已经成熟的充分证明。”该社论并说，“按目前情况发展下去，停止紧急状态是不可能的”。这表示英殖民主义者加紧镇压马来亚人民的计谋的又一次失败。
