Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. A Reuters dispatch from Saigon on the 23rd reports: Most shops and street vendors in Saigon have gone on strike, and all taxi drivers have joined the strike, in protest against the French army's massacre and arrest of Vietnamese students demonstrating against the United States and France on the 19th. The student strike in Saigon's public and private schools is continuing. Local police and French troops have been ordered to maintain a state of "alert." Under the powerful demonstration of the Saigon people, the U.S. Seventh Fleet has fled Saigon in disgrace. According to a United Press dispatch from Saigon on the 20th: The day after the students held a large demonstration, the U.S. warships hurriedly left Saigon. Some U.S. Navy personnel expressed "unhappiness" about the whole affair. They complained that they did not want to come here, but were ordered by the State Department. The State Department's order stated that France requested a "show of force to support the Bao Dai regime."

　　西贡商人罢市  支援示威学生
    美帝舰队已狼狈逃离
    【新华社二十四日讯】据路透社西贡二十三日电：西贡市内的大部分商店及街头小贩均已罢市，一切出租汽车行的司机也都参加罢工，以抗议十九日法军对举行反美反法示威的越南学生的屠杀和逮捕。西贡各公立私立学校学生的罢课，现仍在继续中。当地警察和法国军队都已奉命保持“警戒状态”。在西贡人民的有力示威下，美第七舰队已狼狈逃离西贡。据合众社西贡二十日电称：在学生举行大示威的次日，美舰即匆匆离开西贡。若干美国海军人员对整个事情表示“不愉快”。他们埋怨说，他们并不要到这里来，而是奉了国务院的命令。国务院的命令说，法国要求“显示一下力量，以支持保大政权”。
