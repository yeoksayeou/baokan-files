　　Fourteen Suburban Districts of Beijing Implement Work Relief
    Organizing Five Thousand Farmers to Participate in River Dredging and Canal Digging
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The fourteen districts in the suburbs of Beijing are using work relief, organizing more than five thousand farmers to participate in river dredging and canal digging projects, which began on the 13th. The government will help farmers solve production and living difficulties with more than 360,000 jin of corn. In order to smoothly carry out this work, the district government has established a River Dredging Work Committee, with District Head Zhang Haiwu as the director. Each village has established a River Dredging Brigade Headquarters, with the village's main cadres serving as brigade cadres. Farmers freely form groups of three to seven people. Villagers are very happy and say: "This way, we can be sure that our crops won't be flooded! The government is using work relief, which further solves our current living difficulties."

　　京郊十四区以工代赈
    组织农民五千参加开河挖渠
    【本报讯】京郊十四区以工代赈，组织五千余农民参加开河挖渠工程，已于十三日开工。政府将以三十六万余斤玉米帮助农民解决生产及生活困难。为了顺利地进行这一工作，该区政府建立了掘河工作委员会。由区长张还吾为主任。各村已建立掘河区中队部，由村主要干部任中队干部。农民三人至七人自由结成小组。村民都很高兴的说：这样一来就保证咱们的庄稼淹不了啦！政府又以工代赈，更解决了咱当前的生活困难。
