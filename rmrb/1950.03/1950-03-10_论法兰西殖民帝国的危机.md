Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd (TASS): Stako, in a recent issue of the magazine "New Times," wrote an article discussing the crisis currently being suffered by the French colonial empire. The author wrote that the depth of this crisis has been exposed by the recent events in Vietnam, the result of which is that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—a republic that has been formally recognized by the Soviet Union, China, and many other countries—has emerged on the international stage.

　　Neither organizing a ludicrous Bao Dai government on Vietnamese territory occupied by French forces, nor hurriedly transferring "sovereignty" to Laos and Cambodia, can conceal the bankruptcy of French colonial policy. More than three years of experience with the French Union has educated the oppressed nations of overseas territories, making them understand the true meaning of imperialist tactics. The people of the colonies are not granted the right to self-determination, nor have they ever been consulted as to whether they want to participate in the French Union. Whether in those countries that have already been "vassalized" to the French Union, or in other overseas territories, all power remains in the hands of the governor-general, or in the hands of other "representatives" appointed by the French government. In reality, the people of the colonies are not even able to exercise the formally granted, extremely reduced rights.

　　Three and a half years of experience with the French Union has convincingly demonstrated that the French bourgeoisie's agreement to the colonial empire's hypocritical democratic reforms is merely a political trick.

　　In recent years, a new enemy of the various nations in the French colonies—American imperialism—has appeared. The American imperialist reactionaries are now promoting their expansionist foreign policy in three aspects: economic infiltration, military strategic measures, and propaganda.

　　The following facts briefly illustrate the scale of American economic expansion in the countries of the French Union. Due to the proposal of the largest banks in the United States and France, the "Franco-American Association for the Development of Overseas Territories of the French Union" has been established. At the end of November last year, the United States established a special committee, composed of representatives of the largest American banks, for the purpose of "encouraging and promoting the development of French overseas territories."

　　Regarding the economic invasion of the United States, it is enough to explain its imports to the French colonies. The United States now imports to these French colonies seven point eight times more each year than in 1938, totaling 79 million US dollars. American capital controls a large part of the industry in the French overseas territories. The United States has broken the customs barriers between mainland France and its colonies. The United States' further plan to enslave the French colonies is closely linked to the overall aggressive policy and strategic plan of the US government.

　　The reason why France's African colonies have aroused the interest of American imperialists is not only because they possess extremely abundant resources of important strategic materials, but also because they can serve as a springboard for war adventures. The United States is turning Africa into a huge aircraft carrier, and new strategic highways and railways are now under construction in Africa, and the original ports and airports are now being urgently equipped with new equipment. The warmongers want to "obtain the rear" in dark Africa. At the same time, under the pretext of developing air traffic, a series of air force bases are being built throughout the African continent.

　　The United States is also carrying out propaganda in mainland France and its colonies, calling on them to abandon all rights related to national sovereignty, and fascist theories are being picked out of the fascist arsenal and vigorously promoted. American representatives are trying to cultivate pro-American sentiment in the French colonial government and are conducting a wide-ranging propaganda campaign among the people of French overseas territories, making it effective on extreme reactionaries. In the countries of the French Union, the scope of American expansion is increasing day by day, proving that France is gradually unable to be the master in its own territory.

　　However, the United States cannot dominate these places at will, because the true masters of these colonies are the local people who insist on resisting the French and American colonizers. Stako emphasized the remarkable success of the national liberation struggle in the countries of the French Union in recent years.

　　Stako concluded by saying that the three and a half years since the establishment of the French Union have convinced the colonial people that all the widely publicized "prosperity within the French Union system" is nothing more than a brazen deception aimed at transforming their struggle for freedom and independence. Over the years, the people of the French Union have been deeply convinced that there is only one way to go, and that is to combine the national liberation struggle with the struggle engaged in by the urban working class to eliminate the entire system of imperialist oppression and exploitation.

　　论法兰西殖民帝国的危机
    新时代杂志  斯塔科
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：斯塔科在最近一期的《新时代》杂志上撰文，论述法兰西殖民帝国现在所遭受的危机。作者写道，这个危机的深度，已从越南新近发生的事件上暴露出来，这一事件的结果，是越南民主共和国——一个已被苏联、中国和许多其他国家正式承认了的共和国，已出现于国际舞台之上。
    无论是在法军占领的越南国土上组织一个滑稽的保大政府，或是匆忙地把“主权移交”给老挝和柬埔寨，都不能遮掩法国殖民政策的破产。法兰西联邦三年多的经验，教育了海外领地的被压迫民族，使他们了解了帝国主义的手段的真正意义。殖民地的人民是不被给予自决权利的，也从来没有被征询过他们是否要参加法兰西联邦。不管是在那些已经“附庸”于法兰西联邦的国家里，或在其他海外领土中，全部权力仍然握在总督手里，或仍握在法国政府所委派的另外的“代表”的手里。实际上，殖民地的人民尚不能行使那些正式被给与的、已被极度削减了的权利。
    法兰西联邦三年半的经验，已经很使人信服地证明了法国资产阶级之同意殖民帝国的虚伪的民主改革，只不过是一种政治手腕而已。
    在近年来，法国殖民地各民族的一个新敌人——美帝国主义——已出现在眼前了。美帝国主义反动派，现正从下列三方面推动他们的扩张主义的外交政策：经济渗入、军事战略措施和宣传。
    下面的事实概略地说明了美国在法兰西联邦各国中经济扩张的规模。由于美法两国最大银行的提议，“发展法兰西联邦海外领地法美协会”已经成立了。在去年十一月底，美国已成立了一个专门委员会，是由美国最大的几家银行的代表组成的，目的是为了“鼓励与促进法国海外领地的发展”。
    关于美国的经济侵入，只要说明它向法国殖民地的输入就够了。美国现在每年向这些法国殖民地的输入，已较一九三八年增加了七·八倍，总数达七千九百万美元。美国的资本控制了法国海外领地的工业的大部分。美国已打破了法国本部和其殖民地的海关壁垒。美国进一步的奴役法国殖民地的计划，是与美国政府的总的侵略方针和战略计划紧密联系着的。
    法国的非洲殖民地之所以引起美帝国主义者的兴趣，不仅是它拥有极度丰饶的重要战略物资的资源，也是因为它可作为战争冒险的跳板。美国正在把非洲改变为一个庞大的航空母舰，非洲新的战略性的公路铁路，现在正在建筑中，原有的港口和飞机场，现在正在紧急地装置新配备。战争贩子要在黑暗的非洲“取得后方”。同时，借口要发展航空交通，一连串的空军基地在整个的非洲大陆上建筑起来。
    美国又在法国本部和其殖民地内宣传，叫它们放弃一切有关国家主权的权利，法西斯的理论又正在被从法西斯武库里拣出来，并且大事宣扬。美国的代表竭力在法国殖民地政府里培养亲美精神，并在法国海外领地的人民中进行广泛的宣传运动，使其在极端反动分子身上发生作用。在法兰西联邦国家里，美国的扩展范围日益增大，证明法国在它自己的领土里逐渐地不能做主人了。
    但是，美国也不能随意主宰这些地方，因为这些殖民地的真正主人，是那些坚持反抗法国和美国殖民者的当地人民。斯塔科强调指出近年来法兰西联邦国家中民族解放斗争的显著成功。
    斯塔科结语称，自从法兰西联邦成立后三年半以来，已使殖民地人民很信服地明白所有大事宣传的“法兰西联邦体系内的繁荣”，只不过是一种厚颜无耻的骗局，目的在于转变他们争取自由独立的斗争。在这许多年中，法兰西联邦的人民已经深深地相信只有一条路可走，这便是把民族解放斗争与都市工人阶级所从事的斗争结合起来，以扫除整个帝国主义压迫与剥削的制度。
