[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Fifth District Public Office of Beijing convened a symposium of laboring people's representatives on February 25th, at which many concrete opinions were put forward regarding the construction of roads, sewers, cesspools, and public toilets. The Fifth District Public Office promptly reported these opinions to the Municipal Government, which then distributed them to the relevant departments for consideration and action. The Construction Bureau and the Sanitation Engineering Bureau have now conducted surveys based on these opinions and are handling them accordingly.

Those works already included in the Municipal Government's 1950 work plan (such as many sewers mentioned at the meeting, all belonging to the Inner City system, which are within this year's dredging plan and have already begun renovation; the establishment and renovation of public toilets, which the Sanitation Engineering Bureau has also included in this year's plan, and is now selecting sites to build one each at the west entrance of Ping'anli and Zhonglouwan, and plans to build five or six cesspools at places such as Denai Street, Chaibang Hutong, the west entrance of Wawasi, and the entrance of Nanguanfang, etc.) will be gradually resolved according to the plan. Other opinions will also be accepted under the principle of not affecting the overall work plan and budget for 1950. For example, regarding the steep slope north of Desheng Bridge, which was mentioned at the meeting as being prone to traffic accidents, the Construction Bureau has dispatched a steamroller for repairs, which will be completed soon.

However, some opinions, although very good, cannot be resolved immediately due to practical limitations. For example, the problem of sewer blockage on Denai Street, Xin Kai Road, etc., and the lack of sewers in Nanguanfang, Qianjing Hutong, and the Inner City Garden, which prevents rainwater from being discharged, is because these all belong to the Imperial River system and must be fundamentally designed and renovated before the problem can be solved, so it cannot be improved this year.

　　京市五区劳动人民
    对市政建设提出建议
    【京市新闻处讯】京市第五区公所曾于二月二十五日召开一次劳动人民代表座谈会，对修建马路、下水道、秽水池、公共厕所等提出很多具体意见。第五区公所及时将这些意见汇报市府后，市府即分送有关机关酌办。现建设局及卫生工程局已根据这些意见做了勘察，分别处理。除已包括在市政府一九五○年工作计划以内的工作（如会上提出的好多条下水道，全都属于安内系统，在今年掏挖计划之内，现已开始整修；建立与整修公共厕所问题，卫生工程局也已列入今年计划，现在择定在平安里西口及钟楼湾各修建一座，并计划在德内大街、柴棒胡同、娃娃寺西口、南官坊口等处修建秽水池五座或六座等）均将按照计划陆续解决外，对于其它意见，亦在不影响一九五○年整个工作计划及预算的原则下，予以接受。如会上提出德胜桥北下坡太陡，易出交通事故，建设局已派汽辗一架进行整修，近日即可完工。但也有些意见虽然很好，而限于实际情况，尚不能立时解决的，如德内大街，新开路等处下水道淤塞及南官房，前井胡同，安内花园没有下水道，雨水无法宣泄的问题，因为这些均属御河系统，必需从根本上设计整修，才能解决问题，故今年无法改善。
