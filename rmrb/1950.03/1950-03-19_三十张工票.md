　　Thirty Work Points
    Guyu
    Editor's Note: In issue 39 of this publication (March 12th), we reprinted "New Things, New Ways" and "The Mother-in-Law" by Comrades Guyu and Zhai Shulei. As far as we know, these two short stories have attracted considerable attention from readers. In this issue, we are publishing another short story by Guyu on the theme of organizing mutual aid production for military families. These three works all depict rural life and agricultural production. We hope that literary writers and enthusiasts in factories and troops will also send us their works based on their experiences and observations in real life.
    In the village of Liudi, out of a hundred or so households, there are more than twenty military families, and more than a dozen are short of labor. Last year, the village cultivated land on behalf of the military families, and although the military families were not very wealthy, they were no worse off than other families. Overall, people felt a little burdened. This spring, not a drop of rain fell. The land plowed in the autumn became dusty with every step. The unplowed land cracked with seams as wide as a finger. With the Grain Full (Xiaoman) season approaching, it wouldn't matter much if the millet and sorghum were planted a few days late, but if the cotton wasn't planted soon, it would be too late. The hot wind blew day and night, making people feel as uncomfortable as if twenty-four mice were gnawing at their hearts.
    On March 18th, Assistant Liu from the district came to organize the rush planting, calling for everyone with a bit of strength to use it. The farmers were delighted. They calculated that, including the military families, the village had 650 people, and after deducting 200 elderly and children, there were still 400 people. If each family planted three or two mu of cotton, it wouldn't take much effort at all.
    At the Party branch meeting, branch secretary Gao Laosuo called on Party members to play a guaranteeing role and instructed Daguo to lead Erni in planting.
    On the third morning, Daguo sent thirty work points to Erni and also explained to her the meaning of the superior's call for rush planting this year. Little did Daguo know that as soon as he got home, Erni realized what was happening. She counted the work points and saw there were thirty. She guessed that the land cultivation on behalf of military families would slowly be discontinued: "Humph! They're trying to trick me." She rushed to Daguo's house in a huff: "Why are you giving me twenty fewer work points this year?" Daguo calmly explained to her, "Didn't I tell you a few days ago? There are many military families in our village, and women should use whatever strength they have."
    "You mean you want me to go to the fields! Since I was a child, my mother and I ran a cigarette stall in the city, and I don't even know how to hold a hoe!"
    "Wasn't I the same? I only started practicing after your brother went to join the army. Look, I even have these small feet."
    "One isn't better than the other! You're so advanced, you're good at working! No one forced you in other villages!" After saying that, she pouted and slammed the work points on the table: "You tell the village, it doesn't matter if you don't cultivate the land for me. I'll write a letter to the front and tell that fool to take off his uniform, put down his gun, and come home to farm!" After saying that, she turned around and left, saying as she walked, "People are fighting in the ice and snow, and you begrudge cultivating a little land for them!" Daguo pulled her back and repeatedly persuaded and explained, "Auntie! Don't worry, you're a military family member, and so am I. The village didn't give me a single work point this year, and I'm not worried..."
    "Don't say that, I'm not as advanced as you, so I won't lag behind, hmph!"
    "...Look, I'm having you plant two more mu of cotton for your own sake. Look at your popularity, who would dare to persuade you?" Erni thought for a while and then said:
    "...How about this! The village can cultivate as much or as little as they want, or not at all. I have no opinion, consider it settled."
    "This is our village's plan to plant more cotton this year. How can we not plant it? Besides, this year the government is buying it, and the wealth will be our own. When the people at the front hear about it, your Xiaobao's father will also give a thumbs up in the company: 'I have a capable wife!' Go! Let's plant your family's cotton first today." Daguo reluctantly dragged her to the field. She was still sensible, digging holes, watering, and doing a little work. Everyone in the group was very happy to see her working. During breaks, Sanqiang would perform with a carrying pole like a bear playing with a club, and Xiaoqi would do a "old turtle drinking soup," it was very lively.
    After the whole village finished planting, some groups felt that the task was completed! But this group still wanted to stay together. There was only one problem: they didn't know if Erni was willing or not? Later, they took advantage of her being happy and discussed it with her, and she was too embarrassed to object.
            ★              ★            ★
    For the first few days of hoeing, Erni would always sneak away when people weren't paying attention. When others asked her after returning home, she would say she went back for water or because she was hungry. This gave Daguo the experience: to bring water and a straw hat to the field; and to carry some dry food in his pocket. Daguo also told his children to take good care of her Xiaobao, not to let him fall or get hurt, and to give him a piece of cake to coax him when he wanted his mother.
    April 5th was the Grain Full (Xiaoman) season, and the whole group was hoeing cotton for Erni's family. Others were hoeing two ridges with one swing of the hoe, but because Erni was just learning to hoe, she was given the preferential treatment of hoeing one ridge. In this way, she didn't fall behind in the morning, until the sun was directly overhead, she felt a little tired. At this time, she noticed the small cotton plants, clinging to the clod seams, with thin roots and small leaves, like a small fly lying on the end of a thread. When the small wind blew from the north, they fell to the south, and when it blew from the east, they fell to the west. The more she thought about it, the less energy she had. When she looked at her palm—it was red; her waist was sore; and every time she looked down the ridge was still long. She wanted to leave, but no one else was leaving, and she couldn't find a good reason. She pointed at Daguo's back and said fiercely, "You're killing me! You tricked me into this trap, who knew that hoeing is more tiring than firing a kiln? This hoe doesn't pull straight, it won't come back. You're making progress, but you're dragging me down!"
    Suddenly, the sky darkened, a cool breeze blew, and it was about to rain. The people working in the field shouted excitedly, and they hoeed with more energy. At this time, Erni picked up her hoe and ran: "Go home and close the windows, it's going to rain!" Sanqiang saw her running and chased after her, wanting her to come back and wait for everyone to leave together, but she refused. So the two argued more and more urgently. Daguo advised from afar, but later Sanqiang snatched her hoe, and she said: "This way it's even easier." With that, she turned around and left. Sanqiang stamped his feet in anger in front of everyone, but was too embarrassed to say anything. He was an honored soldier with a straightforward and fiery temper. Lao Kuan also said angrily: "Don't ask her to come again, let's just cultivate it for her!" Daguo persuaded this one and that one: "We're not looking to get angry. This year is a major production, so let's get her to put in a little effort..."
    It rained for two days. Sanqiang was so angry that he only ate one meal, repeatedly saying that he wanted to quit the group. Daguo explained for a long time: "Don't be like her. The fact that she can go to the fields at all is a big improvement compared to before." Then she whispered a few words to Sanqiang, and then she smiled confidently. It turned out that she had told him the good idea that the branch secretary had come up with for her.
            ★                ★              ★
    When Erni's cotton was hoeed for the fourth time, it had already started to stretch its arms. Everyone looked at it, black and seemingly oozing oil. Needless to say, everyone was hoeing with more energy. Erni was also a little better than before. Today some were hoeing, and some were grabbing manure. Erni was temperamental, doing this for a while and then doing that, but everyone didn't say anything, and they all listened to Daguo's words. If they found that her mouth was about to pout, they knew she was tired, and they quickly said: "You've done a lot of work, take a break." "No!" She wouldn't. She was a twenty-one- or two-year-old with the temper of a child whose little boat was sailing smoothly: "Tell a story." She worked even harder. Sanqiang laughed so hard his stomach hurt, thinking to himself: The branch secretary can really figure out people's minds. Daguo then sold one of the two stories he had learned from the branch secretary last night:
    "...Peacocks were extremely ugly in the old days—bare butts, without a single feather. Since learning to build nests, they have been adorned with beautiful feathers. Owls don't learn to build nests, they grow uglier and uglier, and everyone hates them. They're so ashamed that they don't dare to come out during the day..."
    "...When my child's father and Chief Chang (Daguo's husband) were in the army together, the whole company knew that Daguo was good at working. People saw Chief Chang and called out: 'Glorious Husband.' Who wasn't envious!"
    "Sanqiang, would the army laugh at whoever's wife is unskilled in hoeing?"
    "Hey, no, everything is under the leadership of Chairman Mao! The army even engages in production. Labor is glorious!" At this time, Daguo saw Assistant Liu, the branch secretary, the head of the farmers' association... coming here on foot. She suddenly thought of one thing: "Hey, the cadres inspected the crops a few days ago. They put the flag in whichever field was strong. Aren't they coming here!" By this time, the cadres had already walked up. The people in the mutual aid group shouted: "Put it in this field! This cotton has been spread with manure once, and this time it's been grabbed with manure again. It's been hoeed four times!"
    Sure enough, the bright red flag fluttered at the head of Erni's field, and hundreds of envious eyes in the field looked here.
            ★              ★              ★
    On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the mutual aid group held an entertainment party at Daguo's house. The head of the farmers' association came early with a pot of wine; branch secretary Lao Suo carried two chickens; Daguo stir-fried four dishes; Sanqiang picked a large basket of pomegranates and grapes from the yard. The branch secretary's intention was to also hold a review meeting and find some experience. But the moon had already reached the southeast corner, and Erni was the only one missing, which worried everyone. Some people suggested not waiting for her, and others suggested putting away the things and holding it tomorrow. Just as they were arguing, Erni came back with a bundle of cotton. She laughed when she saw this group, and when she saw that Daguo had also returned from the meeting in the district, she took Daguo's hand and said affectionately: "My dear, you're back! I picked the cotton from the east field for you under the moonlight." She held up a stalk of cotton: "Look, there are one hundred and fifteen bolls on this stalk. It has really become a 'dry branch plum'!" This cotton was passed around in everyone's hands, and a proud smile appeared on people's faces. The branch secretary held out two fingers: "Two hundred catties (jin) has to be said going upwards."
    Erni said playfully: "If it's really two hundred catties, where can I put my three mu of cotton?"
    "Write a letter to the front and ask them to think of a way to solve this difficult problem!" Sanqiang's sentence combined with Erni's sentence made everyone in the room laugh.
    Just as they were about to get down to business, Assistant Liu ran in, shouting, "Hey! Good news!" He lifted the curtain and glanced: "You're all in this room!" The small newspaper in his hand attracted the attention of the whole audience. More than a dozen pairs of eyes were staring at it without blinking, and almost their breathing stopped.
    Assistant Liu read word by word: "To Get Rich, Work Hard Together!" This is the title: "The mutual aid in Liudi in the Second District is doing well. The cotton in the military family Daguo's group is estimated to yield 200 catties of cotton per mu... Party member Daguo responded to the superior's call to increase production and used all means to lead the mutual aid group." Everyone applauded and shouted, and it was fortunate that the small house was made of mud. If it was paper, it would have been lifted up long ago. Daguo's face kept changing from white to red to purple.
    "Don't make noise! There's more! Military family member Erni grew up in the city and had never been to the fields. This year, she participated in planting and broke the dependent thinking of relying on others to produce. This year, she was only given thirty work points..." Before Assistant Liu could finish reading, Erni pulled Daguo: "Weren't those work points thrown on this table a few months ago?" Daguo returned the stack of work points to her, and she held them up and shouted: "None of these work points were used. Head of the farmers' association, I'm returning them to you as they were!"
    "No! Use them to compensate everyone."
    "I don't want them!" Sanqiang said.
    "I don't want them even more," said Lao Kuan.
    "The group did more work for me. I'll make two pairs of shoes for everyone in the fall. I don't need work points! Tomorrow, I'll go to the city market and ask the newspaper to change the matter of the work points like this: After 'The village gave her thirty work points,' add seven more words: 'She didn't use a single one.'"
    Everyone in the room jumped up with joy:
    "Good!"
    "When Xiao Bao's father at the front sees this newspaper, won't he feel great!"

专栏：

　　三十张工票
    谷峪
    编者按：本刊三十九期（三月十二日）转载了谷峪和翟树雷两同志所作的《新事新办》和《亲家婆儿》。据我们所知，这两个短篇都引起了不少读者的重视。本期我们又刊载了谷峪的另一个以组织军属互助生产为题材的短篇。这三个作品都是描写农村生活和农业生产的。我们希望：工厂和部队中的文艺写作者和爱好者也把他们通过实际生活的体验与观察而写成的作品寄给本刊。
    柳堤这村子，百十户人家当中就有二十多户军属，缺乏劳动力的也有十几户。村中去年代耕了一年，虽然军属的光景不十分富裕吧，可是比起别家也不坏，总是：人们感觉累赘一点。今年春天，一滴雨也没下，秋耕过来的地一踏一冒烟；没耕过来的地也裂成了一指来宽的缝口。眼看小满到了，谷子高粱晚种几天还不要紧，但棉花再不种就迟了。那热风黑夜白日的吹，吹的人们的心上真像二十四个小老鼠抓心一样不舒服。
    三月十八日，区里刘助理员来组织抢种，号召：有一点劲的都要使出来。这一下农民们可乐了，他们一计算连军工属在内全村六百五十口人，除去二百口老幼以外，还有四百人，每家点上三亩二亩的花，那真是不费吹灰之力。
    党支部会上，支部书记高老锁号召党员起保证作用，并布置叫大国带领二妮点种。
    第三天早晨，大国给二妮送了三十张工票去，当时也和她讲了一下今年上级号召抢种的意思。那知道大国刚回到家，二妮就反过味来了，她一数工票是三十张，她猜这是慢慢地就不管代耕了：“哼！这是指望胡弄我。”她气冲冲地又追到大国家里：“今年怎么少给二十张工票哇？”大国平心静气的和她讲道：“前两天不是我和你说过了吗？咱村军属多，妇女们有一点力也要使出来。”
    “意思是叫我下地呀！从小我和娘在城里摆烟摊就不知那锄怎样拿啊！”
    “我还不是一样？从你大哥参军走以后我才练的。你看我还有这一双小脚呢。”
    “一个不比一个！你多进步呀，你好干！人家村上没有强迫你！”说完她噘着小嘴把工票往桌子上一摔：“你和村上说吧，不给种地不要紧，我给前方写信，叫傻小子脱下军装；放下枪杆回家来种地！”说完扭头就走，边走边说：“人家那人在冰天雪地里打仗，给人家种这点地还嫌冤呢！”大国将她拉回来，左说右劝，再三的鼓励和解释：“她婶子！别着急，你也是军属，我也是军属，今年村上一张工票也没给我，我都不发愁……。”
    “别说那，没你那进步，俺也就不落后了，哼！”
    “……看，我拉你多点上二亩棉花也是为了你呀，你看你走的人缘，谁敢劝你？”二妮想了一会又说：
    “……这样吧！村上给种多就多，少就少，不种就不种，我没意见就算了。”
    “这是咱村计划的今年多种棉花，不种还能行吗？再一说今年公家收买，发了财还不是自己富。前方听说了以后，你小宝他爹也要在连里伸伸大姆指：‘咱有个能干活的好媳妇！’去吧！今天先给你家点。”大国强死赖活的把她拉到地里。她终究还是懂事，刨个坑，浇浇水，多少也干点。全组的人看见她干活就非常欢喜，在休息的时候三强来个狗熊耍扁担，小其来个老?鱼喝汤，热闹的很。
    全村点完种以后，有的小组就觉得完事大吉啦！可是这个组仍然愿意成立着。只有一个问题：不知二妮愿意不愿意？后来大家趁她高兴的时候，给她商量了一下，她也不好意思反对。
            ★              ★            ★
    头几天锄地，二妮总瞅人不注意的时候就开小差。等别人回家问她，她不是说为喝水，就是为饿回来的。这样大国得出了经验：下地提水拿草帽；怀里再把干粮捎。大国又嘱咐自己的孩子，好好领她小宝玩，别摔倒；别碰着，要找娘的时候给他拿块饼子哄哄他。
    四月初五正是小满那一天，全组给二妮家锄棉花，别人都是一锄两个垅背，二妮因为才学锄地被全组优待就锄着一个垅背。这样一来半上午她没掉队，直到太阳照在当头，她才感到有些累。这时就发现了那小棉花，在坷垃缝里夹着，细细的根，小小的叶，就像线头上卧着个小蝇子一样，小风从北吹来往南一倒，从东吹来就往西一倒，越捉摸越不带劲。再一看手心——红了；腰也酸了；一步一看地头还长着哩。拿腿吧，别人都不走自己也找不出充足的理由，她指着大国的脊梁狠狠地说：“你就苦死我了，左圈右圈叫我上了你的套，谁知道锄地，可比浇窑累多多了，这锄不拉劲，它就不回来。你进步还拉个垫背的！”
    突然，天阴上来，一阵凉风吹过，天要下雨了。满地里干活的人都兴奋的大喊大叫，锄的更有劲了，这时二妮却扛起锄来就跑：“回家堵窗户呀，快下雨了！”三强一看她跑开腿就追，追上她，要她回来等一会大伙一块走，但她长短也不，于是俩人越吵越急，大国远远的就劝，到后来三强一手将她的锄夺过来，她却说：“这样更省劲。”说罢扭头就走了。三强到大伙跟前气的干跺脚，就是不好意思说什么。他是个荣誉军人，有刚直的暴脾气，老宽也气的说：“以后再别叫她来了，咱就给她种吧！”大国劝了这个劝那个：“咱不是为了找气生，今年大生产，为了叫她也使上点劲……。”   下了两天雨，三强气的只吃了一顿饭，口口声声要退出小组，大国解释了半天说：“别和她一样见识，现在她能到地里走一趟，比起以前来也是一个大进步。”她又低声向三强说了几句话，然后她充满信心地笑了，原来她把支部书记给她想出来的好办法告诉了他。
            ★                ★              ★
    二妮的棉花锄第四遍的时候，已经开始伸胳膊了，大家伙看着它黑的直想往外冒油，不用说大家是越锄越带劲。二妮也比从前好了一些。今天是锄地的锄地，抓粪的抓粪，二妮那脾气，一会干这，一会又干那，大伙也不说什么，都听了大国的话。如果发现她那嘴快要噘起来的时候，知道她是累了，人们赶忙说：“干的工夫不少了，歇会吧。”“不！”她倒不啦。她是个二十一、二岁的人，有些小船跑顺风的小孩的脾气：“讲个故事吧。”她干的反倒上劲了。三强那里笑的肚子疼，暗道：支书真能捉摸别人的心眼。大国也就把昨晚向支书学来的那两个故事卖了一个：
    “……孔雀在老辈里长的丑极了——光屁股，一根毛也没有，自从学会了搭窝，身上就披挂上了好看的毛。夜猫子不学搭窝，越长越丑，谁看见了谁讨厌，臊的它白天不敢出来……。”
    “……我孩他爹和长营（大国丈夫）在一块当兵的时候，全连人都知道大国能干活，人家见了长营哥，都喊：‘光荣丈夫’，谁不眼红啊！”
    “三强，队伍上知道谁媳妇踏洼下地，不笑话吗？”
    “哎，那里，都是毛主席领导的呀！队伍上还搞生产呢，劳动才是光荣么！”这时大国一眼看见刘助理员、支部书记、农会主任……踏着地上这里来了，她忽然想起一件事：“哎，干部们前两天验庄稼了，看着哪块地里强就把那旗子插在哪地里，那不是他们来啦吗！”这时干部们已走到了跟前。互助组里的人们嚷道：“插在这地里吧，这花铺了一回粪，这会又抓了一回粪，光锄就锄了四遍啦！”
    果然，那鲜红的旗子飘荡在二妮家的地头上，田野里那几百只羡慕着的眼睛都向这里望来。
            ★              ★              ★
    八月十五晚上，互助组在大国屋里开娱乐晚会，农会主任很早的就掂着一壶酒来了；支部书记老锁提着两只鸡；大国炒了四碟菜；三强把院里的石榴、葡萄摘来了一大篮子。支书的意思，也捎着开个检讨会，找一点经验。可是月亮已到了东南角上了，就是少二妮一个人找不到，可把大伙急坏了，有的提意见不等她了，有的提议把东西收起来明天开。正在呛嚷着，二妮背一包袱花来了，她一见这一伙就乐了，又一看大国从区上开会也回来了，她握住大国的手，亲切的说：“我那亲人，你可回来啦！我在月亮底下给你把东地头上的花拾了拾。”她举起一棵花柴：“您看，这一棵上边一百一十五个桃，真成了干枝梅了！”这棵棉花在大家手里传递着，人们的脸上都现出一种骄傲的笑容，支书伸出两个手指头：“二百斤得往上说。”
    二妮俏皮的说：“要真是二百斤，我那三亩花可往那里放呀？”  “给前方写信，叫他们给想个办法，来解决一下这困难问题！”三强这一句和二妮那一句一凑，惹的满屋大笑了。
    刚要书归正传，刘助理一面喊着一面跑进来：“哎！好消息！”掀开帘子一瞧：“都在这屋里呢！”他手中那一张小报，引起了全场的注意，十几双眼睛都不错眼珠的钉着它，几乎呼吸都停止了。
    刘助理一字一句的念道：“要致富忙互助！”这是题：“二区柳堤互助搞的好，军属大国组里的棉花每亩估计收棉花二百斤………党员大国响应上级增加生产的号召，用尽了一切办法来领导了互助组。”大家一阵鼓掌和呼喊，小屋多亏是泥垒的，如果是纸糊的，早就抬起来了。大国的脸上只顾一块一块的由白变红，由红又变成紫。
    “别吵！还有哩！军属二妮从小生长在城市里，没有下过地，今年参加了点种，打破了靠别人生产的依赖思想，今年只给了她三十张工票……”还没等刘助理念完，二妮一拉大国：“前几个月那工票不是丢到这桌上了吗？”大国把那一叠工票还给她，她举在手里嚷道：“这工票一张也没有用，农会主任，还原封还给你！”
    “别！给大伙补补吧。”
    “我不要！”三强说。
    “我更不要了，”老宽说。
    “组里给我多干了活，秋后我一人给做两双鞋，用不着工票！明天我赶城里集，叫报馆里把工票的事再给这样改过来：“在‘村里给了她三十张工票’的底下，再添上七个字：‘她一张也没有用。’”
    满屋里人全都乐的蹦了起来：
    “好！”
    “这报叫前方小宝他爹看见，看痛快不！”
