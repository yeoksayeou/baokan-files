　　Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Station Summarizes One Year of Work
    Vaccine and Smallpox Vaccine Production Greatly Increased       
    More Than Ten Employees Receive Awards
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Station held its 1949 work summary and awards ceremony on the 15th of this month. Li Dequan, Minister of the Central People's Government Health Department, and Li Zhizhong, Director of the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Public Health Bureau, attended. Tang Feifan, Director of the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Station, summarized the past year's work at the meeting. He said that since completing the takeover procedures in mid-February last year, the station has quickly embarked on the road to recovery and development. Democratic management was implemented; trade unions, Communist Youth League and other organizations were established; the Party was made public; the salary system was reformed; and enterprise management was established. Since June, it has become self-sufficient. Now there is a lot of surplus, most of which is used for construction. Recently, cost accounting has also been put on the right track. He said that the station completed two emergency tasks in one year: in November, nine million cubic centimeters of plague vaccine were produced in twenty days, which would have taken five years before liberation; in terms of smallpox vaccine production, 517 cattle were vaccinated, an increase of thirty-eight times compared to the past. At the same time, the Western Suburbs Small Animal Breeding Farm, the Typhus Room, and the Germ Culture Room were established, and seven new products such as crystalline penicillin and plant hormones were manufactured. The quality of the products has also been improved. For example, the concentration of the vaccine has a correct standard after several tests; the bacterial contamination rate of pertussis vaccine has been reduced from 95.5% to 3.5%. In terms of conservation, coal consumption is one-third less than before; a large amount of raw materials such as banana oil and corn slurry have been saved. In addition, 10,000 people were vaccinated with BCG in one year, and a special training class was established to train BCG vaccination technicians. Director Tang pointed out that these achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the concerted efforts of all employees with heightened awareness. He said: There are still shortcomings in our work. For example, more than 7,000 mice died in the Western Suburbs Small Animal Breeding Farm due to infectious diseases, and 20,000 pieces of glassware were broken throughout the station in one year, causing undue losses to state property. He hoped that everyone would resolutely overcome these phenomena. Finally, the conference rewarded fourteen outstanding employees, and Minister of Health Li Dequan personally presented the awards. Minister Li also called on everyone to learn from the meritorious employees.

　　天坛防疫处总结一年工作
    疫苗痘苗产量大增       
    十余职工光荣获奖
    【本报讯】北京天坛防疫处在本月十五日举行一九四九年工作总结和发奖大会。中央人民政府卫生部李德全部长及公共卫生局防疫处李志中处长均出席参加。天坛防疫处汤飞凡处长在会上综述去年的工作。他说该处自去年二月中旬办完接管手续后，迅速走上了恢复发展的道路。实行了管理民主化；建立了工会、青年团等组织；公开了党；改革了薪金制度；建立了企业化管理，从六月份起就达到自给自足。现在盈余很多，大部用在建设方面去了。近来成本会计也走上了正轨。他说，该处在一年中完成了两次紧急任务：十一月底二十天中制成九百万公撮鼠疫菌苗，此项工作要在解放前须用五年时间；牛痘苗制造方面，接种了五一七头牛，比过去增加了三十八倍。同时，建立了西郊小动物饲养场、斑疹伤寒室和菌种室，并制造了结晶盘尼西林、植物荷尔蒙等七种新产品。出品的质量也有改进。如菌苗的浓度经过多次试验有了正确的标准；百日咳疫苗从前染菌率为百分之九十五点五，现在减到百分之三点五。节约方面，煤炭较从前少用三分之一；节省了大量香蕉油、玉蜀黍浆等原料。此外，一年中接种了卡介苗一万人，为了培养卡介苗接种技术人员，还成立了专门的训练班。汤处长指出，这些成绩是党与政府的正确领导和全体职工觉悟提高，共同努力的结果。他说：我们的工作中还有缺点。像西郊小动物饲养场因发生传染病死了小鼠七千多只，全处一年中打破了玻璃器两万件，使国家财产受了不应有的损失，希望大家坚决克服这些现象。最后，大会奖励了十四位成绩优异的职工，由卫生部李德全部长亲自授奖。李部长并号召大家向功臣学习。
