　　I am learning to play Team Leader Zhuang
    ——Excerpts from Actress Yu Lan’s Notes on “White-Clad Warriors”
    Yu Lan
    Long before Comrade Deng Yingchao published the article "Salute to the Female Cadres Working on the Frontlines of the East China Field Army," I had already admired the "white-clad warriors." Today, we are going to portray them on the screen, sing their praises, and I am to play this simple and heroic character, Team Leader Zhuang. How fortunate and delighted I am.
    The director declared the theme of the work—the medical team’s spirit of perseverance, hard work, and self-sacrifice, and its role in the war—I must firmly grasp it and embody it with the inner spirit of the character.
    ...For the past few days, I have been constantly guessing at and experiencing Team Leader Zhuang’s personality. She is resolute and hardworking, courageous in self-sacrifice, and has a firm and unwavering view of cherishing the wounded. But does she have pain and difficulties? What power makes her so resolute? I still don't understand these!
    To better understand her, I went to the hospital for a tour.
    After the tour, I participated in the work of intern nurses, changing dressings and examining wounds with female nurse Lao Wei (as the wounded call her)... The pain of the wounded made me feel uncomfortable. I wondered why I was so fragile. I didn't understand "Li Lanting" and other medical staff. What kind of people are they? And how were they trained? Director Li, Team Leader Yin..., they were so accustomed to and intimate with the wounded. In front of the wounded, they were like us in front of the mercury lamps, without any surprise, pain, or discomfort.
    Before this, my understanding of the character of Team Leader Zhuang was only conceptual. I even felt that if I were in that kind of environment, due to my sense of responsibility, I would be like her, and thus I felt that playing this role would not be too difficult. However, after further contact with actual hospital life, I felt that I did not understand her inner feelings at all.
    I began to feel distressed.
    One day, we went to find Comrade Sun, who used to be a female medical team leader on the front lines. She told us: "...Each victory of the battle gave us a lot of education and encouragement. Victory is joyful, but it is bought with the lives and blood of many comrades. At first, we saw too much and were very painful, but we never revealed it in front of the wounded! But after a long time, we got used to our work, and it was no longer painful but a heat that strengthened our fighting will." These words enlightened me and gave me great strength in later work.
    I met Minister Gong, who enthusiastically encouraged our work. He introduced us to many valuable materials. He said to us with glowing eyes, "Our wounded are so lovable!" Through his relationship, we met many medical workers, and we went to observe surgeries.
    In the operating room, a soldier was lying on the operating table. He stubbornly clenched his mouth to endure the pain of repeated operations. A little nurse went to help him with concern, but he refused!
    Another soldier kept shouting, "Lao Wei, your work is so good, you are our big sister... I will never forget your kindness even if I die... I must go back to the battlefield and beat Jiang Jieshi, that bastard, to death..." Yes, I remembered what Minister Gong said, our soldiers are so lovable. I also saw how many wounded were angry and restless because they could not immediately return to the battlefield. They were so brave and tenacious in treating the enemy, but they were so kind and amiable to their class brothers!
    After the internship, I re-examined "Li Lanting's" materials: "...When she first joined the troops... on a dark and rainy night. When she was alone passing through the blockade line to complete a certain task, she was afraid of getting lost. But when she thought of the soldiers bravely fighting and sacrificing their blood for the revolution, she immediately increased her courage and forgot what fear was..." In this way, she changed from fear to fearlessness and became a female hero who had experienced many battles! She said: "Soldiers shed blood and sacrifice for the revolution on the battlefield. Why can't we dedicate our health and life?" This is the key to understanding the soul of the character I play—in the long-term class and friendship of sharing life and death with the wounded, she established a firm view of cherishing the wounded.
    After several days of exploration, thinking, and practical life experience, the abstract character gradually became visualized.

　　我学习演庄队长
    ——“白衣战士”演员笔记摘录
    于蓝
    远在邓颖超同志发表《向华东野战军前线战地工作的女干部致敬》的文章时，我就曾肃然地向往着“白衣战士”们，今天，我们要在银幕上表现她们，歌颂她们，而且由我表演这朴实的英雄人物——庄队长，我是多么幸运和喜悦。
    导演宣示了作品的主题思想——医疗队坚毅刻苦，自我牺牲的精神及其在战争中的作用——我要紧紧抓住它，用人物内在的精神来体现它。
    ……几天来，我不断地猜摹着体验着庄队长的性格，她坚毅刻苦，勇于自我牺牲，她有坚强不移的强烈的爱护伤员的观点；但是，她有没有痛苦和困难？什么力量使她这样坚毅？对于这些，我还不能了解！
    为了更深的认识她，我到医院去参观。
    参观以后，我参加了实习护士工作，和女护士老魏（伤员们如此称呼她）一起为伤员们换药，看伤口……。伤员们的痛苦使我感到难受，我奇怪自己为什么这样脆弱，我不了解“李兰丁”以及其他医务人员们，她们是怎样的人？又是怎样锻炼的？李主任、殷队长……，他们对于伤员是那么习惯与亲切的，他们在伤员面前，就像我们在水银灯面前一样，毫无惊异、痛苦、难受的样子。
    在这以前，我对庄队长这个人物还只有概念的了解，甚至觉得自己如处在那样的环境中，由于自己的责任心，我也会像她一样，于是便觉得演这个角色也不是太困难的；但是，进一步接触实际的医院生活，我就感到我对于她内心的感情一点也不了解。
    我开始苦恼起来。
    有一天，我们去找一位过去曾当过战地女医疗队长的孙同志。她对我们说：“……每次战役的胜利都给我们很多教育和鼓舞。胜利是快乐的，但却是许多同志的生命和鲜血换来的。起初我们看的太多，也很痛苦，但在伤员面前我们是绝不表露的！但久了我们习惯我们的工作，不再是痛苦而是一股增强战斗意志的热力。”这些话启示了我，在后来的工作中给了我很大的力量。
    我见到了宫部长，他热情地鼓励了我们的工作，他介绍给我们许多可贵的材料。他眼神焕发地对我们说：“我们的伤员是太可爱了！”通过他的关系，我们见到许多医务工作者，我们去参观施行手术。
    手术房里，一个战士躺在手术床上。一次一次的开刀的痛楚，他顽强地紧闭着嘴忍受，一位小护士关切地去扶助他，被他拒绝了！
    另一个战士，口口声声的喊着：“老魏，你的工作太好了，你是我们的大姐……我死了也忘不了你的好处……我回战场去一定要揍死蒋介石这王八旦……”，是的，我想起宫部长的话来，我们的战士太可爱了。我还见到多少伤员为了不能立即重上疆场而气愤不息的样子。他们对待敌人是那样英勇顽强，而他们对待自己的阶级弟兄却是这样亲切，和蔼！
    实习以后，我再次研究“李兰丁”的材料：“………当她初参加部队工作时………在风雨漆黑的夜里。当她独自穿过封锁线完成某种任务时，她曾因迷失方向而害怕。但当她想到战士前仆后继英勇作战，流血牺牲的时候，立刻增加了她的勇气，忘掉了什么叫害怕，……”她就这样由恐惧到无畏，而成为身经百战的女英雄！她说：“战士在战场上为革命而流血牺牲，我们为什么不能献出自己的健康与生命？”这才是理解我所演角色的灵魂深处的钥匙——在长期和伤员同生死共患难的阶级及友谊中，她树立了坚强的爱护伤员的观点。
    经过几天的摸索，思考和实际生活中的体验，抽象的人物才这样逐渐形象化了。
