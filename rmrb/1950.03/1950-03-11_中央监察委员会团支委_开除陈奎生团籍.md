　　Central Supervisory Committee Communist Youth League Branch Committee
    Expels Chen Kuisheng from the League
    [Our Newspaper] The Communist Youth League branch committee of the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government of China recently decided to expel Chen Kuisheng, a member of the branch, from the League. This decision has been approved by the superior League committee and announced to League members and non-League members to educate the broad masses of League members and youth.
    The decision stated: Chen Kuisheng, male, from Qiu County, Shandong Province, is 25 years old and of peasant origin. He joined the Jizhong Field Army in 1942, serving as a soldier for two years and a squad leader for two years. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, he deserted home. He rejoined the workforce in 1947. Initially in the public security department, he was transferred to the guard unit of the North China People's Supervision Institute in July 1949. He joined the Youth League on October 16 of the same year. After the establishment of the Supervisory Committee in November, he continued to serve as a guard in the committee. He deserted again on January 1, 1950. The decision pointed out: Chen Kuisheng's erroneous behavior was entirely the result of the gradual development of the pursuit of personal enjoyment and an incorrect outlook on life. Although Chen Kuisheng had participated in the revolution for seven or eight years, he had never established a revolutionary outlook on life, and his thinking was characterized by a strong sense of freedom, laxity, and egalitarianism. When he first arrived in Beijing, he bought a watch and had gold teeth inlaid with all his savings. The superiors told him that these things were not urgently needed for him and advised him to buy some study materials; but he did not listen and instead complained. After arriving at the Supervisory Committee in July, he expressed his unwillingness to return to the brigade because the army "life was too strict." He was disobedient to the leadership and did not unite well with his comrades. This shortcoming was pointed out when he joined the League, but he failed to correct it. He often quarreled with the squad leader. In mid-December of last year, he became emotional, did not abide by the system, did not get up and go to bed on time, and slacked off in his work. He did not reflect his opinions to the organization, but instead discussed them behind the scenes with backward elements. When the superiors assigned the 1950 army production tasks, requiring that half a year's worth of vegetables and two months' worth of grain be self-sufficient, he complained in the class that the supply system was "too unreasonable," saying that "he had been in the revolution for seven or eight years, which was not as good as a new cadre." When he heard that the army was going to be regularized in 1950 and that military operations would be strengthened, he became even more dissatisfied. Due to the above-mentioned erroneous thinking, coupled with the instigation of backward elements, and the failure of the group and branch to discover and correct it in time, it finally resulted in the serious erroneous behavior of deserting the revolution. The decision pointed out: "The Chen Kuisheng incident tells us that people who participate in revolutionary work with personal intentions, if they do not establish a correct outlook on life after participating in the revolution, haggling over personal gains and losses, and pursuing personal enjoyment, then their future development is very dangerous."
    Therefore, the League branch committee of the Supervisory Committee decided and reported to the superior League committee for approval to announce this matter to League members and non-League members to educate all League members and revolutionary youth.

　　中央监察委员会团支委
    开除陈奎生团籍
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会支部委员会，最近决定开除该支部团员陈奎生团籍。此项决定已经上级团委批准，并向团内外公布，以教育广大团员与青年。
    决定称：陈奎生，男，山东邱县人，现年二十五岁，农民出身。一九四二年参加冀中野战部队任战斗员二年、班长二年。一九四五年抗日战争胜利后曾潜逃回家。一九四七年再参加工作。起初在公安部门，一九四九年七月调华北人民监察院警卫队。十月十六日加入青年团。同年十一月监委会成立后即在该会继续担任警卫工作。于一九五○年一月一日又开小差。决定指出：陈奎生的错误行为，完全是由于追逐个人享受和不正确的人生观逐步发展的结果。陈奎生虽然参加革命已七八年，但始终未确立革命人生观，思想上存在着浓厚的自由散漫及平均主义的色彩。刚到北京时，他把所有积存的钱买了手表、镶上金牙。上级告诉他这些东西对他并非急需，劝他买些学习用品；但是他不听，反而发牢骚。七月到监察院后，他即表示不愿再回大队，因为部队“生活太严”。他对领导不服从，和同志们团结亦不好。入团时曾指出这一缺点，但他未能改正。时常和班长闹别扭。去年十二月中旬，他闹情绪、不遵守制度、不按时起居、工作松懈。有意见不向组织反映，却背地和落后分子议论。上级布置一九五○年军队生产任务，要求做到半年菜金，两月粮食自给的地步，他就在班里埋怨供给制“太不合理”，说“自己革命七八年，还不如一个新干部”。听说一九五○年军队要正规化，要加强军事操作，他更不满。由于上述的错误思想，再加上落后分子的挑拨鼓动，小组和支部又未能及时发觉与纠正，因此终于造成开小差脱离革命的严重错误行为。决定指出：“陈奎生事件告诉我们：含有个人企图而参加革命工作的人，在参加革命后，如果不树立正确的人生观，斤斤计较个人得失，追逐个人享受，则其发展前途是很危险的。”
    为此，监委会团支部委员会决定并呈报上级团委批准，把这件事在团内外公布，以教育所有团员及革命青年。
