Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 19th: Over the past nine months, East China's transportation industry has recovered and developed amidst fierce struggles against blockade and bombing, becoming a crucial driving force for the region's economic reconstruction. According to incomplete statistics, public and private shipping in East China and the Shanghai Railway District completed a total of over 5 million tons of freight and over 17 million passenger trips, in addition to military transport tasks. Coal and grain constituted the majority of freight, ensuring the supply of food and fuel for Shanghai. Taking coal as an example, public coal reserves in Shanghai at the time of liberation often did not exceed 5,000 tons, but now they regularly stand at hundreds of thousands of tons. Furthermore, the development of the transportation industry has facilitated the exchange of grain and industrial raw materials from north of the Yangtze River with cotton yarn, cloth, machinery, and industrial finished products from cities south of the Yangtze River, playing a significant role in developing urban-rural trade and regulating market supply and demand. To facilitate the relocation of factories and schools, the transportation departments have also adopted reduced transportation rates to assist.

The Party, government, and military leadership organs in East China have consistently attached great importance to the work of restoring transportation. After the liberation of Shanghai, the East China Military Region Transportation Command immediately concentrated its efforts to unify the scheduling and organization of coal and grain vehicles and vessels, carrying out planned transportation of coal and grain. With the establishment of the East China Finance and Economics Committee's Transportation Department last September, the scope of transportation was further expanded, while unified scheduling, inspection, and supervision of vehicle and vessel transportation were implemented to ensure the completion of major material transportation tasks. Following the establishment of the East China Military and Political Committee, the department was reorganized into the East China Military and Political Committee's Transportation Department on February 27th of this year, which will strengthen transportation work on the existing foundation and handle various intermodal transport operations to vigorously support the war to liberate Taiwan and enhance material exchange.

The restoration of East China's transportation industry has been carried out under extremely difficult conditions. When the enemy retreated from south of the Yangtze River, various major means of transportation suffered severe damage. In the Shanghai Railway District alone, as many as 59 bridges were destroyed. Most of the ships were towed away or sunk, leaving only one-fifth of the original public vessels and less than one-tenth of the private ones. After the liberation of Shanghai, transportation was frequently disrupted by enemy air raids. However, these difficulties did not halt the work of East China's transportation for a single day. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was opened to traffic the day after the liberation of Shanghai, and the major routes such as the Jiaoji Railway, the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, as well as the direct Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Guangzhou trains, which had been suspended for twelve years, were successively restored. Currently, the operating mileage of the Shanghai Railway District's five lines, namely Shanghai-Nanjing, Nanjing-Wuhu, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Nanchang-Jiujiang, has reached more than 1,700 kilometers. In terms of shipping, Shanghai-Hankou navigation was restored within five days after the liberation of Shanghai, and Shanghai organized a Ship Salvage and Repair Committee, which successively salvaged more than 70 public and private ships. After the enemy blockaded the sea ports, the shipping industry immediately responded to the People's Government's call to focus on inland rivers. As of now, inland waterway navigation in East China has reached 17,152 kilometers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company established the East China Inland River Navigation Company last September, organizing more than 80,000 tons of wooden boats, and has been handling water-land intermodal transport since last November. Recently, the freight volume has increased more than tenfold compared to before, and the area of intermodal transport has been expanded.

　　华东交通运输事业发挥效能
    保证上海煤粮充分供应  大力支援解放台湾战争
    【新华社上海十九日电】华东地区的交通运输事业，九个多月来在尖锐的反封锁轰炸斗争中恢复和发展，成为恢复华东经济建设的一支重要动力。据不完全统计，华东公私营航运和上海区铁路九个月中除完成军运任务外，共完成货运总量五百余万吨，客运一千七百余万人。货运中以煤粮为主，保证了上海粮食和燃料的供应。以煤为例，上海解放初期公营煤业存煤经常不过五千吨，但现在已经常存有几十万吨了。此外，江北粮食、工业原料和江南城市的棉纱、布匹、机器、工业成品等也因交通运输业的发展而能互相交流，对发展城乡贸易，调节市场供求等，均起了极大作用。为便利工厂、学校内迁，交通运输部门并采取了减价运输办法，加以协助。
    华东的党政军领导机关对于恢复交通运输的工作，始终是予以最大重视的。上海解放后，华东军区运输司令部立即集中力量统一调度和组织煤粮车船，有计划地进行煤粮的运输。去年九月华东财委会运输部成立后，更扩大运输范围，同时统一调度和检查监督车船运输，保证完成了主要物资的运输任务。随着华东军政委员会的成立，该部已于今年二月二十七日改组为华东军政委员会交通部，将在原有基础上加强运输工作，并将办理各种联运，以大力支援解放台湾的战争和增强物资交流。
    华东交通运输事业的恢复，是在极其困难的条件下进行的。当敌人从江南溃退时，各种主要运输工具都遭受了严重的破坏，仅上海区的铁路桥梁被破坏的即达五十九座。轮船大多被拖走或炸沉，公营船只留下的仅为原有的五分之一，私营的还不到十分之一。上海解放以后，交通运输又遭受敌机的频繁袭扰。但是，这些困难并没有使华东交通运输工作停顿一天。沪宁路于上海解放次日即告通车，胶济、津浦南段、陇海东段、沪杭、浙赣等主要路线以及停止十二年的京沪、沪穗直达车都先后恢复通车。目前上海区铁路所属沪宁、宁芜、沪杭甬、浙赣、南浔五线通车里程已达一千七百余公里。航运方面，上海解放后五天内就恢复了沪汉通航，上海并组织了船舶打捞修理委员会，先后捞起公、私营船舶七十余艘。海口被敌人封锁后，航业界立刻响应了人民政府面向内河的号召，截至目前为止，华东区内河航运已通航一万七千一百五十二公里。招商局并于去年九月成立华东内河航运公司，组织了木船八万余吨，自去年十一月起办理水陆联运，近来货运量较前已增加十倍以上，并扩大了联运地区。
