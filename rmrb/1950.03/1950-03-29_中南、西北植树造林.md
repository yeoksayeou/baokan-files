Xinhua News Agency, dated the 25th: Central South and Northwest China are actively engaged in afforestation. In Kaifeng County, Henan Province, the people have already planted over two million trees along the Yellow River embankment to prevent wind and sand. The people of Huaiyang, Zhongmu, Tanghe and other counties in the province have also started afforestation. The Hunan Provincial People's Government issued instructions on afforestation, requiring the completion of willow planting along the Dongting Lake and riverbanks by the end of March, and calling on all parts of the province to plant large numbers of tung trees, requiring each person to plant and keep alive one tree. The Nanchang Municipal People's Government in Jiangxi Province has prepared to plant 10,000 camphor and tung trees in the northeastern suburbs. Lingxi Township, Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, has purchased 100,000 pine seedlings and is now starting to plant them. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government has decided to add 10,000 mu of forest farms in the coastal suburbs. The Central South Region Highway Bureau has also begun to plant trees extensively on both sides of the highways. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau has also decided to complete the task of planting 100,000 trees before the Qingming Festival.

The Ningxia Provincial People's Government in Northwest China has issued the 1950 Forestry Plan, deciding to strengthen protection, replant missing trees, and restore the original state as the main tasks of this year's afforestation. At the same time, it stipulates that under the principle of mountain maintenance and forest protection, the conservation of natural forests should be strengthened, and 16,000 protective forests should be planted in the sand areas of Zhongwei and Dengkou counties and the Taole River滩地 along the Yellow River. It requires the masses in Dengkou and seven other counties lacking seedlings to plant one tree per person, while the remaining counties should plant three to five trees per person. In addition, the plan also stipulates that organs, schools, and troops will be mobilized to replant 140,000 missing trees. Various organs, organizations, and troops in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi, are carrying out afforestation campaigns. Since March 5th, various units directly under the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Military Region have planted a total of 22,000 mulberry, peach, cypress and other trees in Yangjialing, Qingliangshan and other places in Yan'an. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Administrative Office, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, the Yan'an Municipal Government and other units have also transported tree seedlings from Liulin District and other places in mid-March and planted them on the mountains near their respective units. The democratic holy land of Yan'an will become a verdant forest in the future.
