[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has recently decided to begin collecting the city's industrial and commercial tax for the second half of last year (1949) starting April 1st. To this end, the Municipal Tax Bureau has been inviting representatives from the city's industrial and commercial sectors for discussions in recent days to solicit opinions; it has also convened a meeting of heads of various tax sub-bureaus to actively prepare for the work. Based on past experiences, the collection of this industrial and commercial tax will still fully adopt the method of democratic appraisal. The units of each industry will generally be adjusted based on the units of the industrial and commercial tax from the first half of last year, partially based on the original level according to the actual situation; for cases where the units of each household within some industries are unbalanced, adjustments will be made appropriately within the units of that industry. The units for newly opened businesses in each industry will be appraised separately based on their business conditions, compared to similar households in the same industry, and will not be within the original units of each industry. The original units of businesses that have closed will be subtracted from the original industry and not be evenly distributed to other households. This industrial and commercial tax includes the income tax for the second half of last year and the business tax for the autumn and winter seasons, which is one season of business tax more than the previous industrial and commercial tax. However, the tax amount is set at 15 jin of millet per unit (13.64 jin for the regular tax, and 1.36 jin for primary school education and sanitation surcharges), only 1.8 jin more than the previous 13.2 jin. The payment of millet will be converted based on the current gold treasury millet price, to avoid the abnormal phenomenon of merchants who paid early losing out in the past, and to ensure that the government's fiscal revenue is not affected. The payment time is decided to be divided into two installments: the first installment is from April 1st to 15th, during which each household must pay one-half of the tax due; the second installment is from April 16th to the end of the month, to fully complete the deposit into the treasury. Industrial and commercial households that have already pre-purchased tax-deductible millet certificates can use one jin to offset one jin of tax. As a result of the above series of measures, industrial and commercial households will feel more convenient in paying this tax, and the government will be able to complete the task of depositing the tax into the treasury as scheduled.

　　京市去年下半年度工商业税
    将于下月分两期征收
    税额每分定为小米十五斤
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府顷决定自四月一日起开征本市去（一九四九）年下半年度工商业税。市税务局为此连日邀请本市工商业界人士举行座谈，征求意见；并召集各税务分局长会议，积极展开准备工作。基于过去两次经验，此次工商业税的征收，仍全部采用民主评议的办法，各行业业分一般根据去年上半年工商业税的分数，按照实际情况部分地在原有基础上予以调整；部分行业内部各户分数不平衡的，则在该行业分数内适当地予以调整。各行业中新开业户的分数依其营业状况比照同行业的近似户另外评议，不在各该行业原分数之内，歇业户的原分数则自该原行业内减出，不匀给其它户负担。此次工商业税包括去年下半年所得税及秋、冬两季的营业税，比上次工商业税要多一季营业税，但税额每分定为小米十五斤（正税十三点六四斤，小学教育费及清洁卫生费附加一点三六斤），较上次十三点二斤只多一点八斤，缴款米价按当日金库米价折算，以避免过去商户早缴吃亏的畸形现象，并保证政府财政收入不致受到损失。而缴纳时间决定分两期，第一期自四月一日至十五日止，在此期内，每户必须缴纳应纳税的二分之一，四月十六日到月底为第二期，全数完成入库。工商业户已经预购纳税折米券的，则可以一斤抵一斤缴税。由于以上一系列措施的结果，将使工商业户在缴纳此次税款中感到更大的方便，而政府也能如期完成税款入库的任务。
