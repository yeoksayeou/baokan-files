Commander Yang then spoke about the experiences in this year's large-scale production preparation work. He first recalled the production situation of the unit in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War in 1942. He said: The scale of production at that time was fundamentally incomparable to the present. The scale of production at that time was tens or hundreds of mu, now it is thousands or tens of thousands of mu. Because this year's production scale is huge, the production preparation work of the corps initially emphasized the issue of organizational leadership. The corps, army, and division-level production committees and production cooperatives at all levels were quickly organized, dividing powers and clarifying responsibilities. In production leadership, it was emphasized that the party committees and leaders at all levels were responsible and personally involved. Therefore, the production preparation work was relatively fast. The corps attached great importance to investigation and research in various production preparations, which was the basic key to completing the preparation work ahead of schedule. Last December, the corps sent cadres accompanied by technical personnel from the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, the Hebei Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, and the Tianjin-Gu Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, representatives of the local people's government, and experienced farmers to conduct on-site surveys, detailed measurements of soil properties, and water conservancy irrigation conditions; the various units paid attention to investigating and researching the various sideline production conditions in their驻地(stationed locations), and quickly determined the objects of agricultural and sideline production. Commander Yang said: We tried all possible methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient production technology and production experience, which is the most prominent feature of this year's large-scale production. Although most of the unit members came from farmers and had production experience during the Anti-Japanese War, the production at that time was mostly individual and scattered, not on the scale of this year. In terms of production methods, this year, in addition to general handicrafts, there are more advanced production methods (such as electric water pumps, dragon bone carts, etc.) and larger-scale sideline industries. Without expert guidance, if we cannot learn certain technologies, we will not be able to complete the task. Therefore, we have attached great importance to the issue of technology improvement from the very beginning, instructing all armies and divisions to widely open various technical training classes with different numbers of people, and the companies and cooperatives at all levels to establish technical research groups, which has widely set off a heatwave of learning various technologies. This has enabled the smooth and early completion of various production preparation works. Finally, Commander Yang said that under the conditions of the country's financial difficulties this year, when we prepared for production, we did not simply rely on national loans or investments. We tried our best to utilize the strength of all commanders and fighters, save expenses, accumulate funds, and appropriately invest the funds in various productions. This is the result of our adherence to the mass line and belief in the power of the masses.

　　杨司令员谈生产准备经验
    各级生产委会迅速组成
    重视调查研究提高技术
    杨司令员接着谈到今年大生产准备工作的经验。他先追忆一九四二年抗日战争最艰苦时期，该部在晋察冀边区生产的情况。他说：那时的生产规模与现在根本不能比拟。那时的生产规模是几十几百亩，现在是几千几万亩，由于今年的生产规模是巨大的，所以兵团生产准备工作一开始，就首先强调组织领导问题。很快地组织了兵团、军、师各级生产委员会和各级生产合作社，划分了职权，分清了责任。在生产领导上，强调各级党委与首长负责，亲自动手。故生产准备工作较快。兵团在各种生产准备过程中十分重视调查研究工作，这是准备工作提前完成的基本关键。去年十二月，兵团即派出干部偕同华北水利工程局、河北水利工程局、津沽农垦局的技术人员，当地人民政府代表和有经验的农民实地勘察，详细测量土质性质和水利灌溉情况；各部队则注意调查研究驻地各种副业生产条件，迅速确定了农业和副业的生产对象。杨司令员说：我们想尽一切可能的办法，克服了生产技术和生产经验不足的困难，这是今年大生产中最突出的特点。部队成员虽大多数来自农民，并有抗日战争时的生产经验，但那时的生产多是个体的，分散的，没有像今年这样大规模的生产过。在生产方法上，今年除了一般的手工业外，还有较高级的生产方法（如电力扬水机、龙骨车等）和有较大规模的副业，如无专家指导，如果不能学会一定的技术，将不能完成任务。因此，我们一开始就十分重视技术提高问题，指示各军师广泛开办人数不等的各种技术训练班，连队及各级合作社成立技术研究组，广泛地掀起一个学习各种技术的热潮。从而使各项生产准备工作能顺利地提前完成。最后，杨司令员说，在今年国家财政困难的条件下，无们准备生产时没有单纯依靠国家贷款或投资，我们尽力发挥全体指战员的力量，节省开支，积累资金，并恰当地将资金投到各种生产上去，这是我们走群众路线和相信群众力量的结果。
