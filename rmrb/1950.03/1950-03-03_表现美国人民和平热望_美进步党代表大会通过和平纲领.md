Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: TASS, Chicago reports: The Second National Convention of the American Progressive Party was held in Chicago starting on February 25th. 1,200 delegates from 35 states attended the meeting. The meeting took place in an atmosphere where American progressive forces were determined to oppose the increasing Fascistization and militarization of the United States, and to oppose the war mania incited by instigators of the escalating arms race and new wars. The work of the meeting, and the peace program and other resolutions it adopted, demonstrated the eager desire of the broad masses of the American people for peace.

	The Bitter Fruits of Military Expansion - Ten Million Families Earn Less Than $2,000 a Year
    Baldwin, Secretary of the National Committee of the American Progressive Party, delivered a work report at the meeting. Baldwin first pointed out: Truman declared that the happiness of the American people could only be guaranteed through armaments, and insisted that world peace could not be won without militarizing the United States. This is the reason why the United States is called a belligerent country. The national income is created by the American people, but the share of the national income obtained by the American people is decreasing every year. Truman has given the monopoly capitalists more profits in four years than Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover gave them in twelve years. At the same time, ten million American families currently earn less than $2,000 a year. As profits increase, unemployment has reached its post-war peak. Farmers' incomes have fallen by one-fifth in one year, and the share of the national income received by workers has been declining continuously since the end of the war.
    Baldwin further pointed out: The Progressive Party continues to exist and work, despite the slander campaign launched against us. There are 1,200 delegates attending the annual meeting, representing 35 states. Local branches of the Progressive Party are working in 22 states. Groups related to the Progressive Party have been organized in other states. In New Jersey, Maryland, California, Ohio, and New York, local organizations of the Progressive Party have defeated several reactionary bills. The Progressive Party is fighting to improve unemployment relief programs, implement rent control, and oppose discrimination against blacks.
    After a brief but intense discussion, the convention adopted the Peace Program. The program pointed out: The Cold War policy, including the "Truman Doctrine," the "Marshall Plan," the North Atlantic Treaty, etc., has failed. It has not brought economic stability to Western Europe, nor has it spared the American people from want and fear. The huge cost of this Cold War has inflated the profits of big capital. However, for the American people, this huge cost has brought worse living conditions and the loss of democratic freedoms. The failure of the Cold War policy has made it clear to an increasing number of Americans that seeking peaceful mutual understanding with the Soviet Union is the central international issue of our time. Maintaining and improving the living standards of our people, preserving freedom, peace, and civilization itself, depends mainly on this issue. The Progressive Party is convinced that the differences between the socialist and capitalist systems of the two countries do not make war between the two countries inevitable, and that peaceful mutual understanding between the two countries, based on mutually beneficial trade relations and peaceful competition between the two systems, is possible and does not require sacrificing the interests of the American people. The first prerequisite for seeking this mutual understanding is for our government to abandon the bankrupt Cold War policy and adopt a new constructive policy supported by the peace-loving majority of the American people.

	Six Recommendations in the Program
    The program recommends to the U.S. government: 1. Propose in the United Nations the conclusion of a treaty declaring all atomic weapons illegal, so that before an agreement is reached on measures for international investigation and control, the full moral force of this United Nations treaty will condemn the use of these weapons of mass destruction as crimes against humanity, and condemn any country that uses them as an international criminal. 2. Promote such a treaty, and in accordance with the Progressive Party's recommendation two years ago, initiate a top-level meeting of U.S. and Soviet officials to seek an overall solution to other outstanding international issues. 3. Immediately recognize the People's Republic of China and establish normal trade relations with that country. 4. Remove existing restrictions that have almost eliminated trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, and restore normal trade with them. 5. Propose that the four powers conclude an agreement reaffirming the Potsdam Declaration on the elimination of German militarism, stipulating that the four powers prevent and prohibit the establishment of any military units of armed forces in their occupation zones. 6. Propose in the United Nations the conclusion of a treaty stipulating the abandonment of all military bases and the right to use bases (including bases in various colonies).
    The program also demands that the United States advocate in the United Nations the complete severance of diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain.

	Condemning U.S. Imperialism's Increase in Armaments and Demanding the Abolition of Anti-Labor Laws
    The convention also passed a resolution condemning the government's policy of increasing armaments. The resolution called for the abolition of the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act, aid to farmers, the cessation of the destruction of "surplus" agricultural products, the passage of public works programs to help the unemployed, and other measures.
    The convention's resolution on housing pointed out that 56 million Americans need new homes. The convention called for the expansion of housing construction programs and the maintenance of rent control.
    The convention also passed a resolution supporting the striking miners, urging the raising of funds to help them, and demanding the abolition of anti-strike court injunctions.
    The convention passed a special resolution urging the struggle for civil rights, against racial discrimination, and persecution of minorities.
    The program adopted by the convention called for an end to reporting progressive ideas to the courts and the abolition of the so-called Smith Act (under which the government framed eleven communist leaders).
    The resolution called for launching a broad movement to fight for civil rights. The convention passed a resolution on the Progressive Party's participation in the upcoming election campaign.
    In addition to adopting the Peace Program, the convention also passed special resolutions on various international issues. A special resolution called for striving for freedom for colonial peoples.
    The convention elected Binson as the first chairman of the Progressive Party's National Committee, Robertson as the second chairman, and Stouffer as the third chairman. Kimble, H. Brisson, Wagner, and Black women's social worker Lawson were elected as vice-chairmen of the National Committee. Baldwin was elected as secretary. Lamont was elected as treasurer. The National Committee, comprising approximately one hundred members, will be composed of delegates selected by the Progressive Party organizations in each state.

　　表现美国人民和平热望
    美进步党代表大会通过和平纲领
    大会选出宾生、罗伯逊、史图佛为全国委员会主席，鲍尔温为书记。
    【新华社北京二日电】据塔斯社芝加哥讯：美国进步党第二届全国代表大会于二月二十五日起在芝加哥举行，出席会议的有三十五州的一千二百名代表。会议是在美国进步力量决心反对美国日益法西斯化和军国主义化、反对加紧进行军备竞赛和新战争挑拨者煽动的战争狂的气氛中进行的。会议的工作和会议所通过的和平纲领及其他决议，表现出美国人民大众对和平的热望。
            扩张军备的恶果  一千万个家庭收入每年不到两千美元
    美国进步党全国委员会书记鲍尔温在会议上作工作报告。鲍尔温首先指出：杜鲁门宣称美国人民的幸福只能通过军备来加以保证，并且硬说不使美国军国主义化就不能赢得世界和平。这正是美国被人称为好战的国家的原因。国民收入是美国人民创造的，而国民收入中美国人民取得的份额，却每年都在减少。杜鲁门在四年内给予垄断资本的利润，比哈定总统、柯立兹总统与胡佛总统在十二年内所给予的还要多。同时，美国一千万个家庭目前每年的收入不到两千美元。随着利润的增加，失业已达到战后的最高峰。在一年之内，农民的收入已减少五分之一，自战争结束以后，国民收入中工人取得份额即在不断下降。
    鲍尔温进一步指出：进步党不顾对我们发动的诽谤运动，继续存在着和工作着。参加年会的代表有一千二百名，代表三十五个州。进步党的地方分会在二十二个州中工作。在其他各州与进步党有关的团体已组织起来。在新泽西州、马里兰州、加利福尼亚州、俄亥俄州及纽约州，进步党的地方组织已击败若干反动的法案。进步党正在为争取改善失业救济计划，实行房租管制及反对对黑人的歧视而斗争。
    大会经过简短而激烈的讨论之后，即通过和平纲领。纲领指出：冷战政策，包括“杜鲁门主义”、“马歇尔计划”、北大西洋公约等等，都失败了。它没有使西欧得到经济稳定，也没有使美国人民免于匮乏与恐惧。为了这种冷战而支出的巨大费用，已经使得大资本的利润膨胀了。但是，对于美国人民，这种巨大的费用却带来了更恶劣的生活条件与民主自由的丧失。冷战政策的失败，使日益众多的美国人清楚地看到：与苏联觅致和平的相互谅解，是我们时代的中心国际问题。维持与改进我们人民的生活水准、保全自由、和平、及文明本身，主要取决于这一问题。进步党确信：两国的社会主义制度与资本主义制度之间的歧异，并未使两国之间的战争不可避免，而两国之间的和平的相互谅解，在互惠贸易关系与两个制度和平竞赛的基础上，是可能的，而且并不需要牺牲美国人民的利益。求得这种互相谅解的第一个先决条件，是我们政府放弃证明破了产的冷战政策，并采取爱好和平的大多数美国人民拥护的新的建设性的政策。
            纲领中的六项建议
    纲领向美国政府建议：一、在联合国内提议，缔结一项宣布一切原子武器为非法的条约，俾在国际调查和管制的措施获致协议之前，这一联合国条约的全部道义力量，将斥责使用这些大规模毁灭武器为反人道的罪行，并斥责任何使用它们的国家为国际罪犯。二、促成这样的条约，并依照进步党两年前的建议，发起美苏官员举行最高级会议，以谋总的解决其他未决的国际问题。三、立即承认中华人民共和国并与该国建立正常的贸易关系。四、取消几乎消除了与苏联及东欧各国之贸易的现存限制，并与它们恢复正常贸易。五、提议四国缔结协议，重申关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦宣言，规定四国防止和禁止任何军事编制的武装部队在其占领区内建立。六、在联合国内提议缔结一项条约，规定放弃一切军事基地及使用基地（包括各殖民地的基地）的权利。
    该纲领并要求美国在联合国内主张与佛朗哥西班牙完全断绝外交关系。
            谴责美帝增加军备要求废除反劳工法
    会议还通过了一项决议，谴责政府增加军备的政策。决议要求废除反劳工的塔夫脱——哈特莱法，援助农民，停止毁坏“剩余”农产品，通过公共工程计划以救助失业者，并采取其他措施。
    会议关于房屋问题的决议指出：五千六百万美国人需要新的住宅。会议要求扩大造屋计划，维持房租管制。
    会议并通过了支持罢工的矿工的决议，敦促筹集款项援助他们，而且要求取消反罢工的法庭禁令。
    会议通过了一项特别决议，敦促为争取公民权利、反对种族歧视与迫害少数民族而斗争。
    会议通过的纲领要求停止向法庭检举进步思想，并废除所谓史密斯法（政府在这个法律下诬害了十一位共产党领袖）。
    决议要求发起争取公民权利的广泛运动。会议通过了关于进步党参加即将到来的竞选运动的决议。
    大会除通过和平纲领之外，并通过了关于各种国际问题的特别决议。一个特别决议，要求为殖民地人民争取自由。
    大会选出了宾生为进步党全国委员会第一主席，罗伯逊为第二主席，史图佛为第三主席。金贝尔、Ｈ·勃立逊、华格及黑人妇女社会工作者劳逊，当选为全国委员会的副主席。鲍尔温当选为书记。拉蒙特当选为司库。全国委员会包括一百人左右，将由各州的进步党组织遴选的代表组成。
