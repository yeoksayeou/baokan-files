　　《China Youth》 Issue 33
    Xiao Feng
    “Developing New Democracy Study” is an important task for current student work. 《China Youth》 Issue 33 focuses on this issue.

    Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, in his article "On Developing New Democracy Study in Schools," points out that the task of the student movement after liberation is to guide the broad masses of students to better learn knowledge and skills and build a New Democratic China. The main key to developing New Democracy Study is to persistently implement ideological and political education. At the same time, progressive thought should be combined with scientific knowledge and sound physique.

    Xiao De's article "Why Go to School?" criticizes many incorrect learning viewpoints and points out that learning should be for serving the working people. The two dispatches, "Political Class at Peking University" and "Report on the Peking University Faculty and Student Representative Conference," introduce the experience of Peking University in developing New Democracy Study. "How the Soviet Komsomol Conducts Communist Education" is written by Han Tianshi, Deputy Head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation who has just returned from abroad. The article introduces the Soviet Union's experience in educating young people with communism from various aspects.

    Historian Fan Wenlan's "On the Reasons for the Long-Term Continuation of Chinese Feudal Society" explains an important issue in the history of Chinese social development.

    "Current Affairs Talk" from this issue onwards will focus on analyzing current major current affairs issues. This issue's "What is the Latest U.S. Policy Toward China?" illustrates that the American imperialists will not lay down their butcher knife and will continue to use all kinds of conspiracies to be enemies of the Chinese people.

    In "Literature Lecture," Ai Qing's "Talking About Writing Poetry" points out the common shortcomings in the poems written by young people and explains what constitutes poetry.

　　《中国青年》三十三期
    萧枫
    “开展新民主主义学习”是当前学生工作的重要任务，《中国青年》第三十三期就是以这个问题作中心的。
    青年团中央副书记蒋南翔同志的《论开展学校中的新民主主义学习》一文，指出解放以后学生运动的任务是要引导广大学生，更好地学习知识技能，建设新民主主义的中国。开展新民主主义学习的主要关键，是在坚持地贯彻思想政治教育。同时进步的思想，要和科学的智识，健全的体魄结合起来。
    萧德同志的《为什么要上学？》一文，批判了许多不正确的学习观点，并指出学习应该是为了给劳动人民服务。《北京大学的政治课》和《记北京大学师生代表会议》两篇通讯，介绍了北京大学开展新民主主义学习的经验。《苏联青年团如何进行共产主义教育》，是刚从国外归来的中国民主青年代表团副团长韩天石同志写的，文中介绍了苏联从多方面以共产主义教育青年的经验。
    历史学家范文澜同志的《论中国封建社会长期延续的原因》，说明中国社会发展史中的一个重要问题。
    《时事漫谈》从本期起，以分析当前主要的时事问题为主。本期的《美国最近对华政策是什么？》说明美帝不会放下屠刀，仍继续在用各式各样的阴谋来和中国人民为敌。
    《文学讲座》中艾青同志的《谈谈写诗》，指出了青年所写的诗中普遍的缺点，并说明了什么样才算是诗。
