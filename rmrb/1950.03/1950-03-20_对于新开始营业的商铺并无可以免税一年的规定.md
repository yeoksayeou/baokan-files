　　There is no regulation for newly opened shops to be exempt from taxes for one year
    To the Editor:
    My shop opened on January 26, 1950. I heard that newly opened shops can be exempted from various taxes (for one year or half a year). I wonder if the People's Government has such a regulation?

    Answer: There is no regulation for newly opened shops to be exempt from taxes for one year or half a year.

    敝号于一九五○年一月二十六日开张，听说新开始营业的商铺可以免征（一年或半年）各种捐税，不知人民政府是否有此项规定？
