　　Suburban Districts of Beijing Overcome Disaster with Thriving Sideline Production
    [Our Newspaper] The rural sideline production in the suburbs of Beijing has now achieved considerable success. In the fourteenth district, regarding saltpeter boiling, by January 8th, a total of 2,000 people were organized, using 152 pots, producing saltpeter equivalent to approximately 300,000 catties of corn, solving the livelihood of nearly 40,000 people. In February, the cooperatives used another 2,200 catties of corn to support five pots in Nangong, Zhiyuanzhuang, and You'anmen villages, and have now produced more than 4,000 catties of saltpeter. It is estimated that another 800,000 catties of saltpeter can continue to be produced in the spring. Last month, the thirteenth district organized 1,300 people from eight villages to dig the moat in the city for three days, earning more than 17,000 catties of millet. Now, more than 200 people from two villages are organized to repair the sewers of Dongbianmen. Each person can earn five catties of millet per day. The nineteenth district organized 5,300 people to engage in transportation, weaving mats and baskets, and making tofu, with a total profit of 360,000 catties of millet. The twentieth district has mobilized the masses to harvest about 50,000 catties of millet worth of vitex branches. In the thirteenth district, twelve villages, women can make 2,200 pairs of soles every day. The wage is one catty of millet per pair. In the northern part of the fourteenth district, some soles are also made. Currently, the cooperative can guarantee the supply of 150,000 pairs of soles. Also, using rags to make interlining can earn more than one catty of millet a day. This work is less strenuous and can be done by women, old and young. With the order of 50,000 straw bags from China Salt Industry Company to the cooperative, the masses in the sixteenth district are stepping up their efforts to make straw bags. The seventeenth district has now organized women from ten villages to learn wool spinning, preparing to add a total of 500 spinning wheels in the villages. This will solve the livelihood of 1,000 people. In the fourteenth district, villages such as Majiapu, Zhiyuanzhuang, and Nantongshun are also preparing to pick grass tea in May. If the sales are good, they can produce 400,000 catties, equivalent to 1.2 million catties of corn. In addition, blacksmithing, weaving mats and baskets, making brooms, hatching chicks, and fishing are also ways of sideline production in the suburbs.
    However, due to the lack of planning for sideline production in leadership and insufficient contact with various parties, there are still many problems that have not been resolved. (1) The twentieth district has 2,500 tons of lime, 11,000 stone slabs, and more than 100,000 catties of vitex branches (which can be used for weaving baskets), but still cannot find a market. (2) The North China Construction Company is crushing stones and sand in the nineteenth district. The cooperative could have contracted this to organize the masses to do it; however, it was contracted by private merchants, who exploited more than 29,000 catties of millet from it. (3) The Municipal Government Hygiene Engineering Bureau ordered more than 40,000 vitex baskets from private merchants; however, the twentieth district has a large number of vitex branches and basket weaving labor force but cannot find customers. In the future, we must strengthen planning from the leadership and contact various parties to solve these problems.

　　京郊各区受灾村  副业生产成绩大
    【本报讯】京郊农村的副业生产，现已获得不少成绩。十四区熬硝，到一月八日为止，共组织二千人，一百五十二个锅，出硝约合玉米三十万斤，解决了将近四万人的生活。二月份，合作社又以二千二百斤玉米，在南宫、志远庄、右安门三个村，扶植五个锅，现已出硝四千多斤。估计春季仍可继续出硝八十万斤。十三区上月份组织八个村一千三百人到城里挖了三天护城河，收入小米一万七千多斤。现又组织两个村二百余人修理东便门的下水道。每人每天可挣五斤小米。十九区组织了五千三百人搞运输、编席筐、做豆腐，共计获利小米三十六万斤。二十区已发动群众采割了约值小米五万斤的荆条。十三区十二个村，妇女每天能纳鞋底二千二百双。每双工资一斤小米。十四区北半部村，也纳一部分鞋底。现合作社能保证十五万双鞋底的供给。还有破布打格褙，一天能挣一斤多小米。这种活较省力，妇女老幼都能作。有了中国盐业公司向合作社订的五万个草包的订货，十六区群众正在加紧打草包。十七区现已组织了十个村妇女学纺羊毛，准备在各村增加纺车共五百辆。将能解决一千人的生活。十四区的马家堡、志远庄、南通顺等村，更准备在五月里采草茶。销路好的话，能产四十万斤，合一百二十万斤玉米。此外，铁匠炉、编席筐、打扫帚、孵小鸡、打鱼等，也都是郊区副业生产的门道。
    但是，由于领导上对副业生产缺少计划，和各方面联系不够，工作中还有不少问题未解决。（一）二十区有二千五百吨石灰，一万一千块石板，十余万斤荆条（可以编筐），还找不到销路。（二）华北建筑公司在十九区打石子、砂子，合作社本可承包下来，组织群众去打；但却被私商包去，从中剥削小米二万九千多斤。（三）市府卫生工程局向私商订购四万多付荆筐；但二十区存着大批荆条和编筐的劳动力却找不到主顾。今后必须从领导上加强计划性，多与各方面联系，来解决这些问题。
