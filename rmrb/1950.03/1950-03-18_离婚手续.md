　　Divorce Procedures

　　If the relationship between a husband and wife has deteriorated or for other reasons, it is difficult to continue the marital relationship, either party may petition the local judicial authorities for a divorce. If, after review by the judicial authorities, the reasons are deemed legitimate and a divorce is pronounced, it is considered to be in accordance with legal procedures (if it is a two-way divorce, where both the man and woman register with the government at the district level or above, and after review and approval, a divorce certificate is issued, this is also valid). If the above procedures have not been followed, and the other party's consent has not been obtained, a unilateral declaration in a newspaper to terminate the marital relationship shall be deemed not in accordance with legal procedures and invalid.

　　离婚手续燕明君：
    夫妇间因感情恶劣或其他原因，难以继续夫妇关系时，任何一方均可向当地司法机关声请离婚。经司法机关审查，认为理由正当而宣判离婚者，即属合乎法定手续（如系两头离婚，男女同向区级以上政府登记，经审查批准领执离婚证书者也属有效）。如未经上述手续，也未征得对方同意，由单方面登报声明脱离夫妇关系，应视为不合法定手续，无效。
