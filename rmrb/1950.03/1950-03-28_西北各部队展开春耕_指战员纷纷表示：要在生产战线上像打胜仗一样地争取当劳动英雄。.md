Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 27th: The People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army have universally launched a production campaign. Troops participating in agricultural production entered the production areas in mid-March and began spring farming. Troops opening up wasteland have resolved the difficulties of tents, firewood, and vegetables and started land reclamation. A certain unit stationed in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, in addition to planning to reclaim 30,000 mu of wasteland, began the construction of five major canals, including Hexitou Dam, Shahe, Gufeng, Huangyang, and Bianwan, at the beginning of this month. Except for the Bianwan Canal project, which is larger and will be one-third completed this year, the remainder are scheduled to be completed before the end of August this year. It is estimated that after all five canals are completed, they can irrigate 300,000 mu of farmland. A certain unit stationed in Yili and 5,000 local people are jointly building a 240-li wasteland canal near the area, which is expected to be completed by April 15th and can irrigate approximately 75,000 mu of land. The troops participating in the construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway and the renovation of the Tianshui-Baoji Railway have set off for the railway line one week ahead of the original plan. A certain unit of the Ningxia garrison built 125 barracks and 83 horse sheds, and also carried out sideline production such as building kang (heated brick beds), weaving mats, and making straw curtains. A certain unit stationed in Kashgar also built new barracks. In the past month, various units under the two army corps have successively held hero and model conferences, proposing to combine guns and hoes, combine production and thrift, and implement the collective heroism in combat into production and construction. The commanders and soldiers of various units have extremely high production enthusiasm, and they have expressed their determination to strive to become labor heroes and production models on the production front just like winning battles. The commanders and soldiers have great confidence in completing the three-month self-sufficiency task.
