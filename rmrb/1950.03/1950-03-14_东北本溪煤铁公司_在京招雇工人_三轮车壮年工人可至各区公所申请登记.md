[News from Beijing News Agency] In order to solve the problem of re-employment for some tricycle workers in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, through the Municipal Labor Bureau, has reached an agreement with the Northeast Benxi Coal and Iron Company to recruit an initial batch of 500 workers in Beijing to send to the company in Northeast China to engage in labor in factories and mines. All tricycle workers who are over 20 and under 40 years old, physically strong, and willing to change careers can apply for registration at the district offices. After passing the inspection, they will be sent to the Northeast Benxi Coal and Iron Company to work; generally, they will be employed as ordinary workers (porters, loaders, etc.), while skilled workers will be assigned appropriately based on their technical skills. The coal and iron company will be responsible for the food, lodging, and transportation expenses en route to Benxi. The company's employee benefits last year were as follows: ordinary workers earned monthly wages ranging from 96 to 145 points, skilled workers earned from 96 to 246 points, and loaders earned piece-rate wages ranging from 145 to 453 points. (According to the regulations of the Northeast People's Government: each work point is valued at 1.63 jin of mixed grain, 0.20 square feet of white Liberation cloth, 0.035 jin of soybean oil, 0.045 jin of sea salt, and 5.5 jin of coal). The working day is eight hours, with one day off every seven days. Overtime pay will be issued separately for special tasks. Workers can receive free hospitalization and treatment, and their immediate family members receive a 50% discount. Each factory and mine has bathhouses, workers' night schools, cooperatives, barbershops, etc. All welfare facilities for workers are handled in accordance with the Labor Insurance Regulations.
