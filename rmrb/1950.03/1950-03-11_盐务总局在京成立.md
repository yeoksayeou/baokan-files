Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th: The National Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government was formally established in Beijing on the 8th of this month. In order to unify the national salt administration, strengthen production, transportation, sales, and taxation work, and to ensure the people's food supply and national income, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on national salt work after the National Salt Affairs Conference in November of last year. The decision stipulated that production, transportation, and sales should be managed separately, and salt tax work should be uniformly led and handled by the National Salt Administration under the Central Ministry of Finance. Therefore, after the establishment of the Administration, China's public and private salt industries will, in accordance with the requirements of national economic construction, begin to embark on a new path under the principle of division of labor in production, sales, and taxation, and adhering to the principle of combining public and private ownership, transportation, and sales.

　　盐务总局在京成立
    【新华社北京十日电】中央人民政府财政部盐务总局已于本月八日在京正式成立。中央人民政府政务院为了统一全国盐务行政，加强生产、运销、税收工作，以保障民食与国家收入，在去年十一月全国盐务会议后，曾颁发了关于全国盐务工作的决定，决定规定产、运、销分工管理，盐税工作由中央财政部设盐务总局统一领导办理。因此，总局成立后，我国公私盐业即将按照国家经济建设的要求，在产、销、税分工管理的方针下，本公私兼制兼运兼销的原则，开始走上新的途径。
