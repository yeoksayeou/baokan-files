Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th—The winter logging work in the Northeast's various forestry areas was completed ten days ahead of schedule on the 10th of this month, fulfilling the original planned task of 3.87 million cubic meters.

This year, the timber harvesting in Northeast China has adopted the advanced Soviet experience of rational logging, ensuring that stumps are generally no more than 30 centimeters high, saving the country approximately 400,000 cubic meters of timber. These saved timber resources, calculated at a minimum market price of 5 million yuan (Northeast currency) per cubic meter, are worth a total of 2 trillion yuan. At the same time, each logger's income has also increased as a result. During logging, methods such as retaining mother trees, segmented logging, and felling trees in one direction were also adopted, greatly reducing timber losses, ensuring the safety of loggers, and laying the foundation for future tree propagation.

The reason why this year's logging tasks in various forestry areas could be completed quickly is mainly due to careful planning and deployment beforehand, the establishment of unified leadership organizations from top to bottom, and the active efforts of responsible cadres at all levels. For example, in Jilin Province, various counties jointly formed logging committees with the Party, government, and forestry bureaus to lead logging operations. Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of Songjiang Province, also personally went to the forestry areas to inspect and supervise. The cadres in charge of logging and the responsible personnel of the Northeast Forestry General Bureau and its affiliated forestry bureaus at all levels were even busier, traversing ice and snow, and going deep into logging sites to help loggers solve various difficult problems; they also mobilized loggers to launch mutual competitions, thus creating countless heroic deeds. For example, after Songjiang Province implemented the competition method of inserting red flags and sending honorary lamps, Li Guoyou's team of the Huachuan County Logging Brigade in the province researched a method of felling trees in one direction, and achieved an average stump height of less than 20 centimeters, winning the title of logging model team in the area. Sang Caifang and Huang Jinshan in the Mohe area sawed 28 cubic feet of timber in one day with one saw, exceeding the highest quota by 79 percent. The Linjiang Forestry Sub-bureau of Liaodong Province also changed the Japanese-style transport tools, adopted new Soviet-style sledges, greatly improving transport efficiency.

After the completion of the logging task, all forestry employees in the Northeast wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 15th of this month, reporting the entire process of completing the logging task. The letter stated: Under your wise leadership, all forestry employees in the Northeast, in coordination with local Party and government organs, completed the task of logging 3.87 million cubic meters of timber on the 10th of this month. It is estimated that the planned output will be exceeded by 3 percent by the 20th of this month. We have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, implemented rational logging for the most part, and opened up a new direction for forestry construction.

　　东北完成冬季林木采伐
    接受苏联经验木材损失大减
    报告毛主席要超过计划产量百分之三
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】东北各林区冬季林木采伐工作，已提前十天在本月十日完成了原计划所规定的三百八十七万立方公尺的任务。
    今年东北地区的林木采伐工作，由于接受了苏联的合理采伐的先进经验，使伐根普遍地不超过三十公分，为国家节省了约有四十万立方公尺的木材。这些节省下来的木材，若按最低市价每立方公尺五百万元（东北币，下同）计算，共值两万亿元。同时，每个采伐者也因此增加了收入。在采伐时，各地还采取了留母树、分段采伐和树向一边倒等采伐办法，大大减少了木材的损失，保障了采伐者的安全，并打下了今后增殖树木的基础。
    今年各林区采伐任务所以能够迅速完成，主要是因为事前有了周密的计划和布置，并自上而下地建立了统一的领导机构，以及各级负责干部积极努力的结果。如吉林省各县都以党、政、林务局共同组成采伐委员会领导采伐作业。松江省主席冯仲云并曾亲赴林区检查、督促。领导采伐工作的干部和东北林务总局及其所辖各级林务局的负责人员，更是日夜忙碌，履冰滑雪，深入采伐场所，帮助采伐工人解决各种困难问题；并发动采伐工人展开了相互间的竞赛，因而创造了无数英雄事迹。如松江省实行了插红旗及送光荣灯的竞赛办法后，该省桦川县采伐大队的李国有组，全组五人即研究出一边倒的伐树办法，并做到了伐根平均在二十公尺以下，荣获了该地采伐模范组的称号。么河区的桑财芳与黄金山，以一道锯一天伐了二十八立方尺的木材，超过最高定额百分之七十九。辽东省临江林务分局并改变了日本式的搬运工具，采用了苏联的新式爬犁，使搬运效率大为提高。
    东北全体林业员工于采伐任务完成后，在本月十五日写信给毛主席，报告这次采伐任务全部完成的经过。信中说：东北林业全体员工在你的英明领导下，配合了当地党政机关，于本月十日完成了采伐木材三百八十七万立方公尺的任务。预计到本月二十日可超过计划产量百分之三。我们学习了苏联的先进经验，大部执行了合理的采伐，开展了林业建设的新方向。
