　　Initial Establishment of Central Night School
    The Central Adult Night School in the Sixth District of Beijing was reorganized on the basis of the Donggaofang Night School. After two weeks of preparation and mobilization, it officially opened on the 13th of this month. There are more than 200 new and old students. A preliminary level placement test has been conducted, and it is now gradually becoming regularized.
    The principle of the reorganization was based on the actual situation of the district, selecting a location that was centrally located, had a large number of working residents, and had good prospects for development. Before the reorganization, three issues had to be resolved: 1. Some of the original students had a higher cultural level than the highest level stipulated for the Central Night School, such as some unemployed intellectuals with junior high school education or above. How should these people be handled? 2. How should students who did not meet the age requirement (under sixteen years old) be handled? 3. Apart from the students who were being reorganized, what should be done if the number of students was too small? After the Culture and Education Section extensively solicited opinions and conducted research, the following solutions were decided: 1. Establish adult middle school preparatory classes to specifically absorb unemployed intellectuals from the original night school. This would not only satisfy their learning needs, but also facilitate the regularization of general night schools. 2. For younger students, persuasive education should be conducted on the one hand, and they should be appropriately introduced to children's supplementary schools or literacy classes based on the proximity of their residence on the other. 3. Student shortages should be resolved by recruiting placement students.
    After two days of mobilization work, approximately 110 new students registered. While resolving these issues, it was decided to specialize the teachers and adopt a class teacher system. While preparing for the opening of the school, preparations were also made for the placement work.
    From this reorganization work, we have initially gained some experience:
    1. In-depth mobilization and explanation are the first key to the establishment of a night school, and also the foundation of night school work. Mobilization work is a difficult and meticulous task. The methods should be flexible and diverse, such as the police station mobilizing activists, street disguised propaganda, old classmates mobilizing neighbors, and door-to-door visits. However, no matter which method is adopted, patient persuasion and explanation that combines their own interests is absolutely necessary. At the same time, conduct surveys during mobilization, listen to their opinions, and break their ideological concerns; in addition, it can also be used as a reference for teaching improvements. In this way, the basic work of the night school can be initially laid.
    2. A new opening ceremony can improve students' learning mood and strengthen learning confidence. The opening day is very important. A good opening method is the first step in consolidating students. After research by the teachers, it was decided to adopt a method that combines ideological education: mobilize old classmates to entertain new classmates in advance, launch a chat movement, so that the first feeling of new classmates is kindness; in the middle, the teachers conduct explanations and enlightenments in classes according to the ideological situation; on the basis of chat explanations, gather together again, and invite Comrade Kang, the head of the District Culture and Education Section, to make a brief and concise report, focusing on the night school system, development prospects, and the relationship between the students' own interests; after the report, invite the students of the Fourth Adult Night School to perform the concise and educational drama "The Harm of Illiteracy." This series of opening methods that combine individual and collective ideological education improved the learning interest of new students, consolidated their confidence in attending night school, and after school, someone said, "Look, illiteracy is so harmful! Let's not come for a few days and then quit!" Women exhorted each other: "Remember to call me when you come the day after tomorrow!"
    3. The placement test is a meticulous and important task, and it has a great relationship with the teaching effect of the night school. Therefore, advance mobilization and explanation must be sufficient, otherwise new students often affect their learning mood due to poor performance in the exam, and even do not come.

### 初办中心夜校

　　初办中心夜校
    京市六区中心成人夜校，是在东高房夜校的基础上整顿起来的。前后经过两周的筹备与动员，于本月十三日正式开了学。新旧生共二百余人，已初步举行了编级测验，目下正渐步入正规。
    整顿的原则是根据该区的实际情况，在校址适中、劳动居民较多、有发展前途的条件下选择出来的。整顿前有三个问题必须解决：一、原有学生中有一部分文化程度超过中心夜校高级的规定，如一些初中程度以上的失学知识分子，对这些人如何处理？二、年龄不合格（在十六岁以下）的学生应如何解决？三、除去整顿的学生外，学生人数太少又该如何办？经过文教科广泛的征求意见及研究，决定了以下的解决办法：一、成立成人中学补习班专门吸收原有夜校的失业知识分子，这样既可满足他们学习要求，一般夜校的步入正规，也有了便利条件。二、对年龄小的学生，一面进行说服教育，一面根据住地远近，适当的介绍他们到儿童补习学校或识字班去。三、学生缺额以招收编级生办法解决。
    经过两天的动员工作，报名的新生约一百十余人；在解决这几个问题同时，决定了教师专人化，采取级任制，一面准备开学事宜，一面筹备编级工作。
    从这次整顿工作中，我们初步取得了一些经验：
    一、深入动员讲解是夜校开办的第一个关键，也是夜校的基础工作。动员工作是一个较困难而细致的工作，方式要灵活多样，如派出所动员积极分子，街头化装宣传，旧同学动员街坊，挨门逐户访问等。但无论采用那几种方式，结合其本身利益的耐心说服和讲解，是绝对必要的。在动员中同时要做调查工作，倾听他们的意见，并打破其思想顾虑；另外又可作为教学上改进的参考。这样即可初步地打下夜校的基础工作。
    二、新的开学仪式可以提高学生的学习情绪，加强学习信心。开学这一天是很重要的，开学方式好，是巩固学生的第一步。经过教师们的研究，决定采用一种与思想教育结合的方式：事前动员旧同学招待新同学，展开聊天运动，让新同学第一个感觉就是亲切；中间由老师根据思想情况分班进行讲解与启发；在漫谈讲解的基础上，再集中一起，请区文教科长康同志作了简短扼要的报告，着重在夜校学制、发展前途及同学本身利害关系方面；报告后聘请第四成人夜校同学演出精短而富有教育意义的话剧《不识字的害处》。这种个别与集体的一连串结合思想教育的开学方式，提高了新同学的学习兴趣，巩固了上夜校的信心，放学后就有人说，你看，不识字害处多大！咱们可不要来几天就不来了！妇女们互相叮嘱着：后天来可叫着我点！
    三、编级测验是一件细致而重要的工作，而它对夜校教学效果关系极大，因此事先动员解释，必须充分，否则新来的同学，往往因考不好而影响学习情绪，甚至就不来了。
