Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th. Shandong Province's public light industry production plan for this year was formulated at the joint conference of public light industry factory directors convened by the Provincial People's Government Production Department in February. The plan requires that this year's light industry output increase by approximately one-fold compared to last year, with costs reduced by 2% to 15%. The conference proceeded with discussions according to production type, divided into five major industries: textile, chemical, paper-making, match, and food, finally specifically determining the production tasks for each industry this year. The textile industry is to increase cloth production by 58% and yarn production by 102% compared to last year, reducing costs by 2%; the food industry is to increase flour production by 217%, reducing costs by 10% to 15%; the paper-making industry is to increase production by 110%, the match industry by 75%, and the chemical industry is to increase production of various vehicle tires by 209%, inner tubes by 278%, rubber shoes by 66%, and various medicines by 50%; the paper-making, match, and chemical industries must all reduce costs by 10%.

In order to guarantee the completion of the plan, the conference emphasized studying and determining further steps to implement democratic management and enterprise operation. Regarding democratic management, factories that have already established factory management committees should convene worker representative conferences to strengthen the organization, enrich the content of the management committee, and communicate this year's production plan; other factories must quickly establish management committees in March and April, launch rationalization proposal campaigns in May, further leverage the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, adjust the existing unscientific management organizations, reduce organizational levels, clarify responsibilities, and establish a system of responsibility at each level. In enterprise operation, each factory is required to start with inventorying materials, improve the inventory and final accounting systems for raw materials, gradually establish departmental and categorized economic accounting and cost budgeting systems, and correct the tendency of blind production, focusing only on completing planned output while neglecting cost calculation. The specific steps are to designate March as a preparation period, conduct trials in April, May, and June, and formally implement the system starting in July. In addition, based on last year's production situation, the conference preliminarily determined the production quotas and operational standards for each industry.

　　山东制订公营轻工业生产计划
    要求年产量增加一倍
    贯彻管理民主化经营企业化保证计划实现
    【新华社济南十六日电】山东省公营轻工业今年的生产计划，已由省人民政府生产部二月份召开的公营轻工业厂长联席会议制定。计划要求今年轻工业的产量比去年增加一倍左右，成本减低百分之二至百分之十五。会议按照生产种类分纺织、化工、造纸、火柴、食品五大业依次进行讨论，最后具体确定了各业今年的生产任务，计纺织业比去年增产布百分之五十八、纱百分之一百零二，减低成本百分之二；食品工业增产面粉百分之二百一十七，减低成本百分之十至十五；造纸业增产百分之一百一十，火柴业增产百分之七十五，化工业增产各种车轮外胎百分之二百零九、车轮内胎百分之二百七十八、胶鞋百分之六十六、各种药品百分之五十；造纸、火柴、化工三业均须减低成本百分之十。
    为了保证计划的完成，会议着重研究并确定了进一步贯彻管理民主化、经营企业化的步骤。在民主管理方面，已成立工厂管理委员会的工厂应召开工人代表会议，健全组织，充实管委会的内容，传达今年的生产计划；其他工厂则须于三、四月间迅速成立管委会，在五月份开展合理化建议运动，进一步发挥工人的积极性和创造性，调整现有的不科学的管理组织，减少机构层次、明确分工、建立按级负责制。在企业经营上则要求各工厂从清理物资着手，健全原材料的盘存和预决算制度，逐步建立分部、分类的经济核算及成本预决算制度，纠正盲目生产、只顾完成计划产量而忽略计算成本的偏向。其具体步骤，定三月份为准备时间，在四、五、六诸月中进行试验，七月开始正式实行。此外，会议并根据去年的生产情况，初步确定了各业的生产定额和经营标准。
