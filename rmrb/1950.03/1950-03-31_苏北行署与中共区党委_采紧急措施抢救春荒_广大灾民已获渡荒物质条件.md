　　The Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office and the CCP Northern Jiangsu District Committee are taking emergency measures to rescue the serious spring famine currently affecting the Northern Jiangsu region. Last year, Northern Jiangsu suffered severe flooding, with over 17 million mu of farmland inundated, accounting for more than one-third of the total cultivated area. Later, through emergency grain allocations by the regional People's Government and the organization of disaster victims to engage in self-help through production, the disaster situation was temporarily halted from developing. However, the region is currently facing the season of grain scarcity before the new harvest, and the spring famine has become severe again. The number of households without food has now increased to over 2 million, accounting for one-quarter of the region's population. In order to urgently rescue and overcome the severe spring famine, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office and the CCP Northern Jiangsu District Committee have adopted the following emergency measures: (1) Allocating grain to provide emergency relief to disaster victims in the severely affected areas. The regional People's Government has decided to allocate two-thirds of the second batch of 20 million jin of emergency relief grain to Huaian, Nantong, and other severely affected areas to provide relief to disaster victims who are unable to engage in self-help through production. Before the wheat harvest, each person will receive four liang of grain per day, which, combined with production, can ensure that 600,000 people overcome the spring famine. (2) Vigorously launching a social mutual aid movement, which is expected to raise 5 to 10 million jin of grain throughout the region to solve the livelihood problems of over 600,000 disaster victims. (3) Organizing 500,000 disaster victims to participate in river management, implementing work relief programs, with the wages earned not only solving the food needs of the river workers themselves but also providing food for 1 million people until the wheat harvest. Organizing disaster victims to engage in various sideline productions. It is estimated that sideline production throughout the region can solve the livelihood difficulties of 2 million disaster victims. (4) The Northern Jiangsu Trade Corporation and cooperatives are also vigorously assisting in the development of sideline production, and will purchase large quantities of vermicelli, sodium nitrate, homespun cloth, rush bags, fishing nets, and other sideline products. To shorten the spring famine, all disaster areas are actively planting early-maturing crops such as green vegetables, and Nantong has completed planting one to two fen of spring vegetables per household. In addition, the People's Government is also conducting organized and planned resettlement of refugees in non-disaster areas. Nearly 100,000 disaster victims have now been resettled in non-disaster areas and lightly affected areas. To solve the food shortage in disaster areas, the Northern Jiangsu Trade Corporation has purchased 10,000 dan of rice and 2.5 million jin of wheat bran from Nanchang, Zhenjiang, and other places; it is also preparing to transfer over 130 million jin of grain from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, southern Anhui, northern Henan, and other places for disaster victims to eat. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office has also allocated 800,000 jin of rice and a batch of medicines for epidemic prevention expenses to various special districts, and organized doctors in various places to carry out epidemic prevention and treatment work in disaster areas. As a result of the above measures, the broad masses of disaster victims have obtained the material conditions to overcome the severe spring famine, thus greatly enhancing their confidence in overcoming the disaster.

    采紧急措施抢救春荒
    广大灾民已获渡荒物质条件
    【新华社上海三十日电】苏北人民行署和中共苏北区党委正采取紧急措施抢救目前苏北区严重的春荒。去年苏北区发生了严重的水灾，被淹田亩一千七百余万亩，占总耕地面积三分之一以上。后经该区人民政府拨粮急救，以及组织灾民进行生产自救，灾情一度停止发展。但该区目前又面临青黄不接的季节，春荒又形严重，全区断炊户现已增至二百万人以上，占全区人口的四分之一。为紧急抢救和战胜严重春荒，苏北行署和中共苏北区党委特采取以下紧急措施：（一）拨粮急救重灾区的灾民。该区人民政府决定从第二批二千万斤急救粮中拨出三分之二发给淮阴、南通等重灾区救济无力生产自救的灾民。麦收前每人每日发给四两粮，结合生产，可保证六十万人渡过春荒。（二）大力开展社会互济运动，预计全区可募集五百万至一千万斤粮食，解决六十余万灾民的生活问题。（三）组织五十万灾民参加治河，实行以工代赈，所得工资除解决河工本人口粮外，尚可解决一百万人到麦收前的口粮。组织灾民进行各种副业生产。预计全区靠副业生产能解决二百万灾民的生活困难。（四）苏北贸易总公司、合作社亦大力协助副业生产的开展，将大量收购粉条、土硝、土布、蒲包、鱼网等副业产品。为缩短春荒，各灾区正大量种植青菜等早熟作物，南通已完成每户种春菜一分至二分地。此外，人民政府并有组织有计划地在非灾区进行安置难民的工作，现非灾区和轻灾区已安插灾民近十万人。为解决灾区粮食困难，苏北贸易公司已从南昌、镇江等地购回大米一万担，麦麸二百五十万斤；还准备从江西、浙江、皖南、豫北等地调运粮食一亿三千余万斤，调剂给灾民食用。苏北行署并拨发各专区防疫经费大米八十万斤和药品一部，组织各地医生开展灾区防疫治疗工作。由于采取了上述各项措施，广大灾民已获得渡过严重春荒的物质条件，因此大大增强了战胜灾荒的信心。
