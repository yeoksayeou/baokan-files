Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, March 23rd: The local committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Commissioner's Office, the Military Subdistrict, and other organs in Hami District, Eastern Xinjiang, jointly invited representatives of various Kazakh tribes to hold a forum. The Zhenxi and Yiwu areas of Hami District are among the nomadic regions of the Kazakh people. The Kuomintang reactionaries had slandered the Kazakh compatriots as "bandits" and "robbers," and frequently sent troops to suppress them. After liberation, Kazakh compatriots still harbored suspicions and fears due to a lack of understanding of the people's government's policy on nationalities. To address this, the Party, government, and military organs of Hami District specially invited representatives of various Kazakh tribes to hold a forum. The Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government also sent personnel to participate. At the meeting, the responsible persons of the Party and government organs explained in detail the people's government's policy of equality among nationalities, calling on Kazakh compatriots to unite with the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to build a new Xinjiang. The representatives unanimously expressed their support and their willingness to go back and mobilize the people of the various Kazakh tribes to elect representatives to participate in the People's Representative Conference of All Nationalities and All Circles in the district. The representatives also requested the government to demarcate pastures, help them with farming and afforestation, and solve their livelihood difficulties. Regarding the small number of bad elements among the Kazakhs who disrupt social order, the representatives expressed their willingness to assist the government in exposing them; at the same time, they requested the People's Government to send representatives to visit their tribes and publicize the various policies of the People's Government. During their stay in Hami, the tribal representatives were deeply moved by hearing leaders at all levels explain revolutionary principles, witnessing the People's Liberation Army's actions to serve the people everywhere, and receiving fraternal hospitality. They unanimously stated that they would tell their fellow tribesmen about this situation upon returning. The Hami Commissioner's Office and Military Subdistrict organs have prepared to organize a Kazakh work team to go to the various tribes to understand the situation and help solve the difficulties of Kazakh compatriots in production.

　　东疆哈密区党政机关
    邀集哈族各部落代表
    座谈各民族平等政策
    【新华社迪化二十三日电】东疆哈密区中共地方委员会、专署、军分区等机关，联合邀请哈萨克族各部落代表举行座谈会。哈密区的镇西、伊吾一带，是哈萨克人民游牧区之一。国民党反动派曾诬蔑哈族同胞为“土匪”、“强盗”，经常派兵剿杀。解放后，哈族同胞由于对人民政府的民族政策不了解，仍存在着怀疑、惧怕的心理。为此，哈密区党、政、军机关特邀请哈族各部落代表举行座谈会。新疆省人民政府民族事务委员会亦派人参加。会上，党、政机关的负责人详细阐明了人民政府的民族平等政策，号召哈族同胞与新疆各民族人民团结起来，建设新新疆。各代表一致表示拥护，愿意回去发动哈族各部落人民，推选代表参加该区各族各界人民代表会议。代表们并要求政府划定牧场，帮助他们进行种地和造林，解决生活困难。对哈族中少数捣乱社会治安的坏分子，代表们表示愿协助政府进行检举；同时要求人民政府派代表到他们部落中去参观并宣传人民政府的各种政策。各部落代表在哈密逗留期间，听到各级首长讲述革命道理，看到解放军处处为人民服务的行动，并受到兄弟般的招待，均极为感动，一致表示回去后要将这种情形告诉各部落同胞。哈密专署及军分区机关已准备组织哈族工作团，赴各部落了解情况，帮助解决哈族同胞生产上的困难。
