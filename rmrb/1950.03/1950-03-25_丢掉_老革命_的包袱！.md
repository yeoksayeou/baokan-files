Throw Away the "Old Revolutionary" Burden!
    Gao Zhaoqing
    First of all, I am grateful to the People's Daily's "Party Life" column on March 14th for exposing and criticizing my mistakes in infringing upon human rights. And urging me to publicly examine myself in the newspaper. For me, this is timely help and education. Precisely because I was working blindly in the past, although I had a preliminary understanding of my mistakes, I was still blindly unaware of the root causes of the mistakes and the methods to correct them. In my mind, there was still the idea that "as long as I admit my mistakes and accept the relevant punishments, it's more or less over, and I won't make such mistakes again." Thinking about it carefully, how dangerous is this kind of thinking! Public self-criticism not only allows me to correctly deal with my mistakes, but also serves as a warning against my indifference, and I feel this, which is why I accepted such criticism and requests in my mind.
    I will not repeat the facts of my mistake here. But at the time, I had no idea that this was a matter of infringing upon human rights, and I was in an extremely numb state of mind. When solving the case, I neither examined myself for such a serious mistake of infringing upon human rights, nor did I apologize to the wronged workers. I was eager to end the matter, hastily passing it through the factory management committee and the entire factory's employee meeting, trying to muddle through. As a result, the masses were agitated and opinions varied, which greatly harmed the people's cause and the Party's prestige.
    After criticism and education from the masses and higher-level leaders, my mind gradually cleared up. I realized that my mistake lay in not knowing how to rely on the workers, not studying policies and laws, and even committing the mistake of infringing upon human rights without realizing it. Due to my own high-and-mighty bureaucratic ways, I did not know that the masses had accumulated many opinions in their hearts, but they dared not raise them because of concerns about their "jobs." When this incident occurred, some workers had already discovered that my younger brother's actions were suspicious, but because he was the factory director's brother, they had concerns, thinking that it was better to do less than more and keep their jobs safe. They dared not even mention it to the factory director! Because I had been a supply-system cadre for a long time, I was not at all alert to this situation, just as the masses analyzed my mistakes: "It takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep." Indeed, surrounded by stale and backward ideas and narrow experiences all day long, I completely lost my sense of new things, and became alienated from the workers and masses day by day, falling into the abyss of bureaucracy.
    From examining this mistake, it was also revealed that I did not use my brain to think much, did not trust the masses, was satisfied with a smattering of knowledge, and did not have an honest attitude of learning and working. As Chairman Mao said in "Reform Our Study": "The reeds on the wall have heavy heads, light feet, and shallow roots; the bamboo shoots in the mountains have sharp mouths, thick skins, and hollow bellies." The meaning of this antithetical couplet completely fits my current situation. The reason why my problems are so serious is that I have been carrying a rotten and outdated burden of narrow experience for a long time. The more I carry, the more and heavier it becomes. Now I have completely lost my motivation to move forward, unable to learn, unable to progress, and even committing serious mistakes. This is the lesson that should be learned from carrying a burden, and it should be taken as a deep warning! Now I feel fortunate that I have had the opportunity to be punished by higher-level leaders and educated by the masses, otherwise I don't know what dangerous stage it would have developed to! Now my spirit is much more relaxed, and I feel particularly fresh and calm in my mind. From the bottom of my heart, I express my gratitude to the higher-level leaders and the masses. In the future, under the education of the Party and the masses, I will throw away my burden, study honestly, and work honestly.
    Finally, it should be stated that I fully accept the basic spirit of the People's Daily's criticism of me. As for certain factual discrepancies, I will not clarify them here, because this does not affect the overall spirit of the criticism.

　　丢掉“老革命”的包袱！
    高兆庆
    我首先感激人民日报三月十四日《党的生活》栏对于我侵犯人权的错误的揭发和批评。并催促我公开在报纸上进行检讨。对于我说，这是恰合时宜的帮助和教育。正是由于我过去在盲目的工作着，所以虽然初步的认识了错误，但对揭发产生错误的根源以及纠正错误的方法都仍然是盲目的。在思想上还是存在着“只要承认了自己的错误，并接受有关方面的处分，大体上就算完事，反正今后再也不犯这样错误了”。细想起来，这种思想的危险性是多么严重啊！公开的进行检讨，不仅使我正确处理自己的错误，并使我百事不在乎的思想又受到一次警惕，我感觉到了这一点，才在思想上接受了这样的批评和要求。
    我的错误的事实经过不在这里重复了。但当时思想上一点没有意识到这是侵犯人权的问题，自己是处在极端麻木不仁的思想情况之下。在破案时，对侵犯人权这样严重的错误，既没有检讨，又没有对受委屈的工友进行道歉，急于结束这个问题，潦草的通过工厂管理委员会和全厂职工大会企图马虎了之。于是群情沸腾意见纷纭，使人民的事业、党的威信受到了很大的危害。
    经过群众和上级领导的批评教育以后，我的思想才逐步的清醒起来。认识了我的错误在于不懂得依靠工人，不学习政策法令，以至犯了侵犯人权的错误而还不自觉。由于自己高高在上的官僚主义，不知道群众心中积存很多意见，但有“饭碗问题”的顾虑而不敢提出。这次事件发生，有的工人已经发现我弟弟行迹可疑，但因为是厂长的弟弟而有顾虑，认为多一事不如少一事，保住饭碗为妙，算了吧。更不敢和厂长当面来提呀！因为自己长时间是供给制的干部，对这种情况，是一点也没有警惕，正如群众分析我的错误中说的：“冰冻三尺非一日之寒”。的确如此，终日为陈腐落后思想和狭隘经验所包围，就根本失去了对新事物的感觉，而一天一天与工人群众疏远，陷于官僚主义的深渊。
    从检讨这一次错误当中，也暴露了我不多用脑子思索，不相信群众，满足于一知半解，没有老老实实的学习态度和工作态度。正如毛主席在《改造我们的学习》中说的：“墙上芦苇头重脚轻根底浅；山间竹笋嘴尖皮厚腹中空”。这副对子的意思完全符合我今天的情况。我的毛病所以会这样严重，就是长期的背着腐旧不堪的狭隘经验包袱，愈背愈多愈重，背到现在已完全失去了前进心，不能学习，不能进步，以致犯了严重错误。这就是背包袱应得的教训，应深深地引为警惕！现在感觉喜幸的是，有机会受到了上级领导的处分和群众的教育，否则还不知会发展到什么样的危险地步哩！现在我的精神是轻松得多了，思想上也感觉特别新鲜而镇静，从内心中对上级领导和群众表示感谢。今后，我要在党和群众的教育下，丢下包袱，老老实实的学习，老老实实的工作。
    最后应当表明人民日报对我的批评的基本精神我全部接受。至于某些事实的出入，不在这里申明，因为这并不影响整个批评的精神。
