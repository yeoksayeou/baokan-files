The Preliminary Experiences in Teaching at the Cadre School of the Xinxian Special District, Shanxi Province
    Hua Sheng
    I. Academic Achievements
    The Cadre School of the Xinxian Special District, Shanxi Province, was originally a cadre cultural tutoring class, composed of county and district cadres and family members of southbound cadres transferred from seven counties including Xinxian, Shouyang, Yangqu, Mengxian, Pingding, Dingxiang, and Wutai. The entire school had over one hundred and twenty people, divided into three classes, all of whom were illiterate or semi-illiterate. When they first arrived, half of them only knew ten, twenty, or thirty words, and only a very few knew one or two hundred words. There were also twenty-seven housewives who didn't know a single word. The ages were generally young and middle-aged, with some older comrades in their thirties and forties. Their political understanding, work history, abilities, experiences, ideological sentiments, and motivations for coming to the school varied, and there was a fairly widespread lack of confidence in learning. At the beginning of the semester, the school announced that it would lay a foundation for self-study within six months, proposing "Six words a day, over a thousand words in half a year; knowing over a thousand words, no worries about reading newspapers." During the first month's check-up, the second class generally recognized one hundred fifty to two hundred words, those who came late recognized only sixty, seventy, twenty, or thirty words. There were three people who recognized more than three hundred to four hundred words, and sixty percent could write three or five short sentences with very few different characters. Three or five people could write fifty or sixty-word letters home, with generally seven or eight typos. In the second month's check-up, most recognized more than three hundred words and could write a few fluent sentences to express their meaning. If they wrote letters home or about things related to daily life and work, more than half could express their main ideas. According to the situation in the first class, out of thirty-three students, more than half could write ordinary letters or explain some frequently encountered things. For example, Hu Yinfeng from the first class, who had studied at a primary school for two months last year, could write ordinary letters and write diaries of about three hundred words after studying for two months at the school. Below is an excerpt from her diary:
    "August 22nd       Sunny
    Last night, we had a group criticism meeting. During the meeting, I felt that the students' enthusiasm was not high enough. Everyone was silent when the meeting started, which made me feel really unhappy. After a long time, Comrade Lan Cuizhi gave a good speech. Only after her speech did everyone slowly start talking. During the discussion, I saw that Yue'e's speech was very correct and I loved listening to it the most. The words she spoke were very appropriate for discussing some things. After she finished speaking, I felt very happy. Finally, I talked about my study plan. Since coming to school, I felt a lot of distress at first because I had never been away from home and was not used to the classmates. Also, my cultural level was very low because I had never attended school since I was a child. I couldn't keep up with the other students in all subjects, so I felt really discouraged. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, our classmates performed the Yangko dance to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, and I felt happy again. I must be determined and study hard in the future."
    Based on the above situation, the school believes that it is possible to lay a foundation for self-study within six months.
  II. Ideological Leadership in Cadre Schools
    Strengthening ideological leadership is the key to ensuring that all students can study with peace of mind. The school's main experiences in this area are as follows:
    (1) At the beginning of the school year, there was a widespread belief that "not much can be learned in half a year," and general confidence was not high. The school used statistics from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia mass newspaper in the past to illustrate that we often use only one thousand five hundred to one thousand six hundred characters. Recognizing more than one thousand characters in half a year would allow one to read popular books and newspapers. It also used vivid examples of many worker-peasant cadres in the revolutionary ranks actively learning culture and achieving certain accomplishments to educate them, gradually resolving this ideological problem.
    (2) There was "meritorious hero" thinking. They felt that they had worked for many years and achieved results in the past, but today they are still far behind some new cadres. They felt that "worker-peasant cadres can't get anywhere without culture," and there was a sense of alienation between them and the school. The solution was to make them realize that it is glorious to have achievements, but compared to the entire world revolutionary cause, it is only a drop in the ocean and one should not "rest on one's laurels." They also needed to realize that in the old society, people like us had no opportunity to attend school. Today, the people have seized power and have this opportunity to cultivate worker-peasant cadres and improve their culture, which is a valuable thing for worker-peasant cadres. In this way, their thinking was quickly resolved.
    (3) There was fear that cultural levels would improve and they would be transferred to work in the south. Some deliberately said that their level was low, and some even feigned illness. The school introduced the construction of Northeast China and the Soviet Union, and explained that the journey of more than two thousand miles from Shanghai to Beijing can be reached in two days. In the future, when aviation is well-developed, it will be easy to come home to visit even if you go to South China. More importantly, it guided the students to recall who held the power in the old society, making them understand the significance of working in the south. This made everyone overcome their narrow localism, broaden their horizons, and also stimulated their revolutionary enthusiasm and class consciousness. After this problem was resolved, the comrades who had originally feigned illness also worked hard to study.
    (4) Some district-level cadres, relying on their work experience, were arrogant and complacent and unwilling to learn humbly. They believed that they had worked for many years without culture in the past, and that learning a little bit of culture now would not make much of a difference. They were also not used to this kind of life, so they were unwilling to learn humbly. The school used Chairman Mao's words "We must have the attitude of being a willing pupil" to educate them, and told them that improving their culture would enable them to better exert their work ability and experience. After group criticism, they gradually changed.
    (5) Some individuals had family difficulties, or caused disunity, engaged in small sectarianism, etc., which must be resolved in a timely manner, otherwise it would affect their learning mood and effectiveness.
    Solving ideological problems mainly involves raising their political awareness, while coordinating with solving their practical difficulties, which is more effective.
  III. Exploration of Teaching Methods
    The teaching method adopts five sequences: (1) Helping students to first engage in practical learning activities, i.e., preliminary reading, lecturing, writing, and application. (2) Teachers lecture, explaining the errors in reading, explanation, and writing based on the pre-learning situation, and explaining the general meaning of single words and difficult sentences, which can strengthen memory. (3) Teachers point out the key points of learning, and students discuss, study, and review them. (4) Practical application, allowing students to try to apply what they have learned, with teachers providing guidance and timely testing, so that learning and application can be unified. (5) Summary, the teacher summarizes the specific situation of the entire learning process of each material by the students, so that teaching and learning can be correctly criticized to improve teaching and learning.
    This teaching sequence mainly lies in the teacher's mastery and promotion, but some subjects and learning materials cannot be forced to be fully implemented according to the above sequence.
    IV. Textbook Issues
    A. Regarding Chinese textbooks: Because the target audience is district-level cadres, they have considerable work experience and social knowledge. If the textbooks are too generalized, they are not interested. If they are too deep, they cannot accept them. Choosing primary school textbooks is not suitable for adult learning; choosing middle school Chinese is also rarely related to their actual situation. If the lessons are too long, it is necessary to take into account how many words they recognize; if the lessons are too short, it is necessary to take into account whether the content is rich and whether they are interested in learning, otherwise everyone will not like to learn. At the same time, attention must also be paid to improving culture through Chinese classes, so appropriate materials must be re-compiled for Chinese textbooks.
    B. Regarding natural science textbooks: It is believed that daily life is closely related to natural science (including physiology and hygiene), and it is very necessary to learn it, but the great role of natural science in the formation of a communist worldview has not been recognized, nor has it been deeply recognized that there are still superstitious ideas among many students with low cultural levels. These ideological realities should be linked in teaching, such as dispelling superstitious concepts about solar and lunar eclipses, wind, rain, thunder, electricity, and air that have been passed down for generations.
    C. Regarding history textbooks: Chinese historical knowledge should be taught systematically. However, there is only one hour per week, which is short. It is felt that it is insufficient to only talk about modern revolutionary history, and appropriate supplementary materials must be provided. In addition, when teaching historical knowledge, it is necessary to criticize the feudal and capitalist ideological toxins lurking in consciousness, and at the same time pay attention to the correct relationship between social development and individual development.
    D. Regarding political textbooks: At the beginning, political textbooks (excluding current affairs) focused on selecting materials on current political, economic, and cultural construction. This material can be barely accepted in the first class, but not in the second and third classes. At present, the school believes that political classes should mainly first teach some knowledge about labor creating the world, productive forces promoting social development, class struggle, the communist outlook on life, and the historical materialist worldview, then teach the knowledge of the Party, and finally teach the knowledge of the construction of the new democratic country.
  V. Several Characteristics of Cadre Schools
    Cadre schools are different from general schools, and also different from the learning of ordinary rural young men and women:
    First: The vast majority of students progress quickly, so the teaching progress should generally be fast, otherwise they feel that what they are learning is superficial and they cannot learn anything. However, a small number progress very slowly, and the more they are taught, the more confused they become. Second: Chinese, political, and history classes are generally accepted quickly; arithmetic and natural science are accepted slowly. Third: Generally, students have high requirements and hope to learn many things quickly, so they oppose materials that are not substantial in content and are complex in form. Fourth: They like frequent tests, like encouragement, and should not be blamed too much. Fifth: Generally, students have a strong sense of self-esteem in learning and are also highly motivated. They should be grasped tightly, and the learning workload can be slightly heavier, but they should also be able to digest and feel happy under the conditions of genuine effort in learning. If it is relaxed, they become undisciplined and feel that the leadership is insufficient. These characteristics should be well grasped.
    Generally speaking, the experience of the Cadre School of the Xinxian Special District, Shanxi Province, is good and can be used as a reference for cadre schools and cultural learning in amateur schools of institutions. Its main shortcoming is that the time is only half a year and there is a lack of a formal academic year system, which is a problem worthy of attention by the school and other cadre cultural schools in various places.

　　山西忻县专区干部学校教导工作的初步经验
    华生
    一、学习成绩
    忻县专区干部学校原为干部文化补习班，系由忻县、寿阳、阳曲、盂县、平定、定襄、五台等七县调来之县、区干部及南下干部之家属组成。全校一百二十余人，共分三班，均为文盲半文盲。初来时有半数仅识一、二十字或三、五十字，能识百余字二百余字的为极少数，还有二十七个家庭妇女，一字不识。年龄一般是青壮年，部分是三十至四十以上的老同志。他们的政治认识、工作历史、能力、经验、思想情绪与来校动机都有不同，相当普遍地对学习信心不高。在开学时，该校曾宣布要在半年内打下自学基础，提出“每日六个字，半年认千余，识下千余字，看报不发愁。”在第一个月检查时，二班普遍认一百五十至二百余字，八、九个来晚的只认六、七十或二、三十字，有三人认三百多至四百多，有百分之六十可写三、五句短句，差别字很少，三、五人可写五、六十字的家信，一般还有七、八个错别字。第二个月检查，多数的认到三百字以上，可以写几句通顺话，说明自己的意思，如果写些家信或日常生活与工作有关的东西，半数以上可以表达自己的主要意思。根据一班情况，学员三十三人，半数以上可以写普通信或说明一些经常接触的事物。如一班胡银凤，去年在小学念过两个月书，来校后又学习了两个月，可以写普通信件，写三百字左右的日记，下面是她的一段日记：
    “八月二十二日      晴
    昨天晚间开了个小组检讨会。会议的情形，我感到同学们情绪有的不够高，一说开会大家都不说话，我就觉得实在不高兴。停了好多时间后，兰翠枝同志发言很好。自她发言以后大家才慢慢谈起来。讨论当中，我看到就是月娥同学发言很正确，最爱听，说出来的话，对一些事情谈的非常适当。自她谈完以后，我就觉得很痛快。最后，把我的学习计划谈了一下。自从来到学校，初来了那时候，我觉得好多苦恼，原因是自己没有出过门子，又且和同学们还不惯，再说我的文化程度很是低，因为自小没有上过学校，各门功课跟不上其他同学，因此就实在泄气。自从过八月十五以后，我们同学扭了秧歌，庆祝了中华人民共和国的成立，我就又感到愉快，以后要好好的下决心，努力学习。”
    根据以上情况，该校认为半年内是可以打下自学基础的。
  二、干校的思想领导问题
    加强思想领导，是使全体学员安心学习的关键，该校在这一方面的主要经验如下：
    （一）初开学时，普遍存在着“半年工夫，学习不下什么”的思想，一般的信心不高，该校曾用过去陕甘宁群众报的统计，说明我们经常使用的字，不过一千五六百，半年内认字一千多，就可以阅读通俗书报，并将革命队伍中许多工农干部积极学习文化，得到一定成就的生动实例，进行教育，逐渐的解决了这一思想问题。
    （二）有“功臣思想”，觉得自己过去工作多年有了成绩，今天还远不如一些新干部，觉得“工农干部没文化就吃不开了”，精神上和学校有隔阂。解决办法是使之认识有成绩是光荣的，但比起整个世界革命事业来，不过是大海中的一滴，不应该以“有功自居”，并使之认识在旧社会像我们这些人是没有住学校机会的，今天人民掌握了政权才有这种机会，培养工农干部，提高文化，正是宝贵工农干部。这样，思想也就很快得到解决。
    （三）害怕文化水平提高了，调江南工作。有的故意说自己水平低，有的还装病，该校就把东北的建设和苏联的建设介绍了一下，并解释从上海到北京二千多里的行程，两天可达到，以后航空也建设好，即使到了华南，要回家来看看，也是容易的，更重要的是引导学员回忆旧社会里政权掌握在谁手里，使之了解南下工作的意义，这样使大家把狭隘的乡土观念克服了，眼光放大了，也激发了大家的革命热情与阶级觉悟。这个问题解决后原来装病的同志也努力学习了。
    （四）有些区一级的干部，凭着自己有工作经验，骄傲自满，不肯虚心学习。他们认为过去没有文化，也工作多年，如今让学文化，学上一点半点的，也顶不了什么事，又不习惯这种生活，因此就不肯虚心学习。该校引用毛主席的话“要有甘当小学生的态度”，进行教育，并告诉他们提高文化才能更好的发挥自己的工作能力与经验，经过小组检讨，也逐渐转变过来。
    （五）还有个别人有家庭困难，或闹不团结，闹小宗派等，都须及时解决，否则就会影响学习情绪及效果。
    解决思想问题主要是注意提高其政治觉悟，同时和解决其实际困难等相互配合，收效较大。
  三、教学方法上的摸索
    教学方法采用五个顺序：（一）帮助学员先进行学习上的实际活动，即先行试读、试讲、试写、试用。（二）教员讲授，根据预先学习情况，如阅读、讲解、书写中的错误，加以解释，并把单字难句说明大意，这样可以加强记忆。（三）教员指出学习要点，学员加以讨论研究复习。（四）实际运用，让学员将所学材料试行应用，教员加以辅导及适时测验，这样可使学用统一。（五）总结，教员根据学员对每一材料学习的全部过程中的具体情况，加以总结，使教与学得到正确的批判，以改进教与学。
    这一教学顺序，主要在于教员的掌握推动，但有些科目及学习材料，也不能勉强完全根据上述顺序实施。
    四、教材问题
    甲、关于国文教材：因为对象是区级干部，他们具备了相当的工作经验、社会知识，即使没有文化基础，但教材一般化了，他们不感兴趣，深了又接受不了。选小学课本，不适合成人学习；选中学国文，内容上和他们实际联系也很少，课文长了，要照顾他们认字的多少；课文短了，要照顾内容的充实与否和他们的学习兴趣，否则大家就不喜欢学；同时还须注意通过国文课提高文化，因此国文教材方面只好重新编选适当材料。
    乙，关于自然科学教材：认为日常生活方面和自然科学（包括生理卫生）有很密切的联系，是很需要学习的，但还没有认识到自然科学对于共产主义世界观之养成，有其极大的作用，也没有深刻认识到在不少文化水平低的学员中，仍存在迷信思想，应该在教学中联系这些思想实际，如关于日月蚀、风、雨、雷、电、空气等世代流传的迷信观念，予以揭破。
    丙、关于历史教材：应该有系统地讲授中国历史知识。但每周只上一小时，时间短促，单讲近代革命史，又感到不足，必须有适当补充材料。另外在讲授历史知识时要批判在意识中潜藏的封建主义与资本主义思想毒素，同时还须注意社会发展与个人发展的正确关系。
    丁、关于政治教材：政治教材（时事的不包括在内），开始时着重选了一些当前的政治、经济、文化建设方面的材料。这种材料在一班勉强可以接受，二、三班不行。目前该校认为政治课主要应该首先讲授一些劳动创造世界，生产力推动社会发展，阶级斗争，共产主义人生观，以及历史唯物主义的世界观等知识，再讲党的知识，最后讲新民主主义国家建设的知识。
  五、干校的几个特点
    干校与一般学校不同，也与一般农村男女青年的学习不同：
    第一：绝大多数学员进步很快，因之讲授进度一般应当快，否则他们嫌学的浅，学不下东西；但有少数却进步非常之慢，讲授多了就越闹越糊涂。第二：国文课、政治课、历史课一般接受快；算术课、自然科学接受慢。第三：一般学员要求高，希望很快的学许多东西，所以反对内容不充实，形式又庞杂的材料。第四：喜欢经常的测验，喜欢鼓励，不宜多责备。第五：一般的学习自尊心很强，自动性也强，应该抓的紧些，学习分量可略重些，但也要使他在真正努力学习的情况下能够消化感到愉快。松了则散漫起来，反觉得领导上不够，这些特点，是应该很好掌握的。
    一般说来，忻县专区干部学校的经验是好的，可供干部学校及机关业余学校文化学习的参考，其主要缺点是时间只有半年，缺乏正规的学年制度，这是值得该校及其他各地所办的干部文化学校加以注意的问题。
