　　The Beijing Telephone Third Sub-bureau Needs to Improve Work Efficiency
    We applied to the Telephone Third Sub-bureau this month on the tenth to install a telephone for us. Two people came that day and asked where it should be installed. We asked when it could be installed, and they replied, "It can be installed tomorrow." However, on the fifteenth, another person came and again asked where it should be installed. We asked again when it could be installed? The reply was again, "It can be installed tomorrow." Both times it was clearly registered in the logbook, and we were asked to stamp it. But the telephone still hasn't been installed after more than ten days. We can't find out the reason. I think this greatly hinders work. During these ten days, our work has suffered some losses. We believe that the work efficiency of the Telephone Third Sub-bureau is too low. (Political Department of the First Regiment of the Beijing Public Security General Team, Wang Fushan)

　　京市电话三分局工作效率要提高
    我们从本月十号就请电话三分局给我们装置机子，当天来了两个人，问清了装在什么地方。我们问何时能安好，回答说“明天可装好”。可是到十五号又来了一个人，又问明了安在什么地方。我们再问何时能安好？回答又是“明天可安好”。两次都用登记簿子登记清了，且让我们盖上了章。但是机子到现在十几天了还没有装起来。什么原因也问不出来。我想这样对工作是有很大妨碍的，我们这十几天当中，工作多少是受些损失的，我们认为电话三分局的工作效率太低了。（北京公安总队一团政治处  王福山）
