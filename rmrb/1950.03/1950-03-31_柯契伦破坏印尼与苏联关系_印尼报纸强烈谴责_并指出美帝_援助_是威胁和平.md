Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, March 30th: Indonesian newspapers are voicing strong anger at American interference in the internal affairs of the United States of Indonesia and the actions of the American Ambassador to Indonesia, Cochran, in ordering the destruction of relations between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. The Medan "Alertness News" in Sumatra pointed out: Cochran is constantly exerting pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to force them to destroy diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated: "We should very clearly point out that the Indonesian people should not be used to achieve American goals." The "Compass News" published in Jakarta pointed out that the United States wants to turn Indonesia into its military base. The newspaper warned the Indonesian people that the so-called "aid" from the United States to the United States of Indonesia is actually a threat to peace. The Jakarta "Freedom News" wrote: The United States wants to use Southeast Asian countries to achieve its own military goals. However, the people of all countries are unwilling to do so, and the failure the United States suffered in China is waiting for it in Southeast Asian countries. "Indonesian News" demanded that the Hatta government prevent Indonesia from being used to achieve the aggressive aims of the United States.

    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社海牙二十九日讯：印尼报纸对于美国干涉印尼合众国内政及美国驻印尼大使柯契伦命令破坏苏联与印尼的关系的行动，发出强烈愤怒的呼声。苏门答腊棉兰《警惕报》指出：柯契伦正不断对苏加诺及哈达运用压力，以迫使他们破坏与苏联的外交关系。该报称：“我们应该极明确地指出，印尼人民不要被利用来达到美国的目的。”雅加达出版的《指南针报》指出：美国想把印尼变成他们的军事基地。该报警告印尼人民，美国对印尼合众国的所谓“援助”，实际上是对和平的威胁。雅加达《自由报》写道：美国想利用东南亚的国家来达到它自己的军事目的。但是，各国人民不愿这样，美国在中国所遭到的失败，正在东南亚各国等待着它。《印尼新闻报》要求哈达政府防止印尼被利用来达到美国的侵略目的。
