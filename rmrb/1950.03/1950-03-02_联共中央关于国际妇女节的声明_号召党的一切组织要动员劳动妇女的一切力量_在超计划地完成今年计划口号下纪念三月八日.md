Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 1st (TASS): The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) has issued the following statement on International Women's Day:

　　This year, the Soviet people are celebrating March 8th, International Women's Day, on the eve of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in an atmosphere of solidarity and trust in the Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government, and with a strong upsurge of the political and labor activities of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals who are showing boundless loyalty to the cause of communism.

　　During the years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have achieved new and significant achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural development, guaranteeing a tremendous improvement in the material well-being and cultural level of the working people. These achievements prove the great vitality of the Soviet system and its superiority over the capitalist system.

　　Our country knows nothing of crises and unemployment. In the Soviet Union, national income is gradually increasing, consumer goods prices are constantly decreasing, and the people's purchasing power is rising. The Soviet state spends huge sums on social insurance, relief, holidays, free medical assistance, and general and vocational school education. In 1949 alone, the state spent 110 billion rubles on these aspects. A large-scale housing construction plan is being implemented. Thanks to the Stalinist care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, the lives of Soviet women, like the lives of all our people, are improving day by day.

　　The people of capitalist countries are welcoming March 8th in the context of a new economic crisis that is increasingly maturing, and with unemployment and poverty continuing to grow. Here, the situation of working women is particularly difficult. They are the first to suffer layoffs. They receive lower wages. Capitalism dooms the working masses to suffer hunger and poverty, and women and children are the first to bear the brunt.

　　The socialist system created by the October Revolution has completely liberated women from social, economic, and spiritual enslavement. The great cause of women's liberation is embodied in the Stalin Constitution. In the Soviet Union, women have not only obtained political rights, but in practice, they are also guaranteed the exercise of these rights because they enjoy equal rights with men in terms of work, remuneration, rest, social insurance, and education.

　　Soviet women actively exercise their rights. Two hundred and seventy-seven of the representatives in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are women. More than 1,700 women have been elected to the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, and nearly 500,000 women have been elected to the local Soviets of Working People's Deputies. Now, the best daughters of the Soviet people have been nominated as candidates to participate in the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　Our country's women's creative ability is manifested in all aspects of socialist construction. Millions of patriotic women are working selflessly in enterprises and on construction sites. More than 327,000 women are serving as engineers and technicians, actively participating in the nationwide socialist competition to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Female workers in socialist industry and transportation are perfecting their skills, mastering modern technology and new working methods in industry.

　　In the socialist competition for yearly bumper harvests and the maximum increase in the number of livestock and the productivity of livestock products in collective animal husbandry, and for the most rapid completion of Stalin's plan to transform nature, collective farm women are pioneers. Thousands of women are chairpersons of collective farm committees, tens of thousands of women serve as tractor and combine drivers, and tens of thousands of collective farm women are heads, captains, and chairpersons of livestock farms.

　　Soviet women have full opportunities to access science and culture. Women account for nearly 50 percent of all experts who have completed higher education in the Soviet Union. Female scientists, female engineers, female technicians, and female agronomists enrich Soviet science and add to its glory with their research, inventions, and discoveries. Female writers and female artists create works with high ideological content, inspiring the Soviet people to strive for new achievements that glorify the motherland. Two hundred and eighty-nine women have won Stalin Prizes for their outstanding achievements and inventions in science, literature, and art.

　　Soviet women play a huge role in education and health services. Nearly 900,000 Soviet female teachers are educating the young generation in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and lofty communist consciousness. More than one million women work in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and maternity and child health centers.

　　The labor achievements of Soviet women in factories, manufacturing plants, research institutes and laboratories, in the fields and on livestock farms are highly praised by the Soviet government. More than 500,000 women have been awarded Soviet orders and medals, and 1,600 women have been awarded the lofty title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

　　In the Soviet Union, a national system has been established to guarantee the welfare of mothers and children. Women receive full pay for pre-natal and post-natal leave, and nurseries, kindergartens, and clinics are spread throughout the country. The Party and the government pay constant attention to raising the next generation – the future of our motherland. Two million seven hundred and seventy thousand women have been awarded the "Motherhood Glory" Order and the "Motherhood Medal." Thirty thousand seven hundred and fifty women have been awarded the glorious title of "Heroine Mother." Several billion rubles are allocated annually to subsidize mothers with many children and single mothers.

　　The free and happy life of Soviet women provides a moving example for women all over the world. Equality between men and women has become a reality in the people's democratic countries. The free women of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, North Korea, the great People's Republic of China, and the free women of the German Democratic Republic are actively participating in the political, economic, and cultural life of their respective countries.

　　Working women all over the world are commemorating International Women's Day in an atmosphere of further growth of the strength of the anti-imperialist camp fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism, against the American and British instigators of a new war.

　　For the first time in human history, there has emerged an organized front for peace, headed by the Soviet Union, uniting hundreds of millions of peace supporters. The front of peace supporters constitutes a powerful force sufficient to contain the imperialist warmongers and thwart their aggressive plans.

　　The women's democratic movement is an important force in the struggle for peace. Women cannot and will not stand aloof from the common cause of all progressive humanity.

　　Eighty million women are participating in the Women's International Democratic Federation. The women of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are at the forefront of the international women's democratic movement for peace.

　　The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) proposes that all Party organizations commemorate March 8th – International Women's Day – by mobilizing all the strength of working women under the slogan of fulfilling and over-fulfilling the 1950 plan. The activities of female workers, female engineers, and female technicians must aim to increase labor productivity, improve quality, reduce production costs, and promote technological progress in all sectors of the national economy. The most important task of collective farm women is to further increase yields, complete Stalin's plan to transform nature, and complete the three-year plan for the development of collective animal husbandry, guaranteeing an abundant food supply for our country. The responsibility of female scientists and female cultural workers is to ensure the progress of our science, to enrich Soviet literature and art with new works of high ideological content and great artistic value, and to further improve the people's education and health services.

　　The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) requires that the Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations more boldly and resolutely promote outstanding women to leadership positions in Party organizations, state and economic organs, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations, and provide them with daily assistance in their work and ideological and political development. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) emphasizes that promoting women to leadership positions is a most important task of great significance for the state.

　　The Party, Soviet, trade union, and mass organizations must pay even more attention to improving the working conditions and living conditions of Soviet women, protecting women's labor in industry, and improving the quality of canteens, shops, laundries, and other social services. More concern must be shown for mothers, and they must be given regular assistance in nurturing the younger generation. The use of funds allocated by the state for increasing the number of maternity hospitals and children's institutions and for assisting mothers with many children and single mothers should be strictly supervised.

　　Soviet women must continue to strengthen their international ties with women in the people's democratic countries and capitalist countries, and they must work with them to fight for a lasting and consolidated peace among nations, for freedom and democracy, and against the instigators of a new war.

　　On March 8th – International Women's Day – the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) extends warm greetings to all working women of the Soviet Union – female workers, collective farm women, female engineers, female technicians, female agronomists, female teachers, female medical workers, and female science and art workers. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) firmly believes that the Soviet women, who have been honored in defending the freedom and independence of our socialist motherland, will also be at the forefront of peaceful construction, striving for a more prosperous development of the Soviet Union's economy and culture and for the great cause of building communism in our country.

　　联共中央关于国际妇女节的声明
    号召党的一切组织要动员劳动妇女的一切力量
    在超计划地完成今年计划口号下纪念三月八日
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会顷发表关于国际妇女节的声明如下：
    今年，苏联人民在苏联最高苏维埃选举前夕，在团结一致、信赖列宁与斯大林党及苏维埃政府、和对共产主义事业表现无限忠诚的苏联工人、农民及知识分子的政治与劳动活动强有力高涨的气氛中，庆祝三月八日——国际妇女节。
    在战后五年计划的岁月中，苏联人民在共产党领导下，在经济与文化发展的各方面获得了新的重大成就，保证了劳动人民的物质福利与文化水平的巨大改善。这些成就证明了苏维埃制度的伟大的活力，证明了它对于资本主义制度的优越性。
    我们的国家不知道什么是危机和失业。在苏联，国民收入逐步增加、消费品价格不断减低、人民的购买力在提高着。苏维埃国家在社会保险、救助、假期、免费医疗帮助、普通与职业学校教育等方面支用巨额的款项。仅在一九四九年，国家在这些方面就支用了一千一百亿卢布。大规模的造屋计划正在执行中。由于共产党和苏维埃政府的斯大林式的关怀，苏联妇女的生活正如我国全体人民的生活一样，逐日都在改善着。
    资本主义国家的人民是在新的经济危机日益成熟，和失业与贫穷继续增长的情况下迎接三月八日。在这里，劳动妇女的处境特别艰辛。她们首先遭受解雇。她们得到较低的工资。资本主义注定了劳动群众要遭受饥饿与贫穷，而首当其冲的就是妇女和儿童。
    十月革命所创设的社会主义制度，使妇女们从社会、经济和精神的奴役当中获得了完全的解放。解放妇女的伟大事迹体现在斯大林宪法中。在苏联，妇女们不只得到了政治权利，而且在实际上，由于她们和男人平等地享有工作、取酬、休息、社会保险和受教育等项权利，她们对这些权利之行使也获得了保障。
    苏联妇女积极地行使她们的权利。苏联最高苏维埃代表中有二百七十七名是妇女。有一千七百余名妇女已经被选入加盟共和国和自治共和国的最高苏维埃，并且有将近五十万妇女已经被选入各地方的劳动人民代表苏维埃。现在，苏联人民最优秀的女儿已被提名为候选人，参加即将到来的苏联最高苏维埃的选举。
    我国妇女的创造能力表现在社会主义建设的各方面。数以百万计的爱国妇女在企业中和建筑现场上忘我地工作着。有三十二万七千以上的妇女充任工程师和技师，积极地参加为提早完成战后五年计划而举行的全国范围的社会主义竞赛，社会主义工业与运输业的女工使自己的技术臻于完善，精通近代的技术和工业的新的工作方法。
    在为了年年丰收和集体养畜业的牲畜数目与牲畜产物生产率的最大增加，为了最迅速地完成改造自然的斯大林计划而举行的社会主义竞赛中，集体农妇们是先锋。数以千计的妇女是集体农场委员会的主席，数万妇女充任拖拉机和联合机的司机，成千成万的集体农妇是牲畜饲养场的小组长、队长和主席。
    苏联妇女有接近科学与文化的充分机会。在苏联业已受完了高等教育的一切专家当中，妇女几乎占百分之五十。女科学家、女工程师、女技师和女农业学家丰富着苏维埃科学，并且以她们的研究、发明和发现来添加它的荣誉。女作家和女艺术家创作具有高度思想内容的作品，鼓舞苏维埃人民为光耀祖国的新的业绩而努力。有二百八十九位妇女因为在科学、文学和艺术方面的卓越成就和发明而荣获斯大林奖金。
    苏维埃妇女在教育和卫生服务方面起着巨大的作用。将近有九十万苏维埃女教师以苏维埃的爱国主义和崇高的共产主义觉悟的精神教育着年青的一代。有一百余万妇女在医院、诊疗所、药房和妇婴诊察站工作。
    在工厂、制造厂，在研究院和实验室，在田间和牲畜饲养场的苏维埃妇女，她们的劳动业迹受到苏维埃政府很大的赞许。有五十余万妇女荣获苏联勋章与奖章，有一千六百名妇女荣获社会主义劳动英雄的崇高称号。
    在苏联，业已建立保障母婴福利的国家制度。妇女产前产后休假工资照付，保育院、幼稚园和诊察站遍布于全国各地。党与政府对养育后代——我们祖国的将来——予以经常的关怀。二百七十七万妇女荣获“母亲之光”勋章和“母亲奖章”。三万另七百五十名妇女荣获“母亲英雄”的光荣称号。每年以好几十亿卢布补助多子多女的母亲和单身母亲。
    苏维埃妇女的自由而幸福的生活，给全世界的妇女提供了动人的榜样。男女平等在人民民主国家中已经成为现实。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、北朝鲜、伟大的中华人民共和国的自由妇女和德意志民主共和国的自由妇女，均积极地参加各该国的政治、经济和文化生活。
    全世界的劳动妇女是在为和平、民主与社会主义、反对新战争的美英挑拨者而斗争的反帝国主义阵营之力量进一步增长的气氛中纪念国际妇女节。
    在人类历史上第一次出现了以苏联为首的、团结着亿万和平拥护者的、有组织的和平阵线。和平拥护者阵线构成了足以遏制帝国主义战争贩子、足以挫败他们的侵略计划的强大力量。
    妇女的民主运动乃是争取和平斗争中的重要力量，妇女是不能而且也不愿意超然于外地不参加全体进步人类的共同事业的。
    八千万妇女参加了国际民主妇联。苏联和各人民民主国家的妇女走在争取和平的国际妇女民主运动的前列。
    苏联共产党中央委员会提议：党的一切组织应在动员劳动妇女的一切力量，在完成和超计划地完成一九五○年计划的口号下，来纪念三月八日——国际妇女节。女工、女工程师、女技师的活动，必须以提高劳动生产率、改进质量、减低生产成本和促进国民经济各部门的技术进步为目的。集体农妇最重要的任务，乃是进一步提高收获量，完成改造自然的斯大林计划和完成发展集体养畜业的三年计划，保证我国粮食丰足。女科学与女文化工作者的责任，乃是保证我国科学的进步，以具有高度思想内容和伟大的艺术价值的新作品，来充实苏维埃文学和艺术，进一步增进人民的教育和卫生服务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会要求：党、苏维埃、工会和共产主义青年团的组织，更大胆而且更坚决地提拔优秀的妇女到党组织、国家和经济机关、工会和共产主义青年团组织的领导职位上，在她们的工作和思想与政治发展方面，每天都给予她们帮助。苏联共产党中央委员会着重指出，提拔妇女到领导的职位上，对于国家来说，乃是具有伟大意义的最最重要的任务。
    党、苏维埃、工会与群众组织对于改善苏维埃妇女的劳动条件与生活条件，保护工业中的妇女劳动，改善食堂、商店、洗衣间及其他社会服务的质量，必须予以甚至更多的注意。对母亲们必须予以更多的关切，并经常帮助她们培养青年后代，国家指拨用于增设产科医院和儿童机关、援助多子多女母亲和单身母亲的基金，应严格监督其使用。
    苏维埃妇女必须继续加强与人民民主国家和资本主义国家的妇女的国际联系，而且必须和她们一道，共同为各民族间的持久与巩固的和平、为自由与民主、反对新战争的挑拨者而斗争。
    在三月八日——国际妇女节这一天，苏联共产党中央委员会谨向苏联的一切劳动妇女——女工、集体农妇、女工程师、女技师、女农业学家、女教师、女医药工作者和女科学与艺术工作者——致热烈的敬礼。苏联共产党中央委员会坚信在捍卫我们社会主义祖国的自由与独立中曾享有荣誉的苏维埃妇女，在和平建设中也将走在最前列，为苏联的经济与文化更欣欣向荣的发展和我国建设共产主义的伟大事业而奋斗。
                         苏联共产党中央委员会（签字）
