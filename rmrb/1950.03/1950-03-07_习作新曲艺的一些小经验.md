Some Small Experiences in Practicing New Quyi
    Lao She

Based on my own experience in practicing popular quyi, I would like to offer the following points for consideration:

    (1) Grasping the Form: In folk quyi, not to mention singing, even speaking has certain techniques and forms. Our new poems must be changed into drum lyrics or ditties before they can be sung, and our new novels must be changed into storytelling before they can be told. That is to say, we must use the techniques and forms of folk quyi to tell or sing our works to the people. Therefore, to create quyi for the people, we must first grasp the form of quyi.

    Of course, we can create new forms. But this is not the issue I want to discuss here.

    The most appropriate way is to learn one or two sections of drum lyrics from artists before writing drum lyrics; learn one or two sections of clapper talk before writing clapper talk. Even if we ourselves are rough and clumsy, if we can speak or sing one or two sections of old material, it will be much easier when we get to writing this kind of thing.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I met Mr. Fu Shaofang, who sang Beijing-style drum songs, and Ms. Dong Lianzhi, who sang rake drum songs. They asked me to write new lyrics, and I asked them to teach me to sing one or two sections first. They really taught me two of the longest and most difficult drum books to learn. This effort was not in vain. By the time I picked up my pen to try writing, I had a general idea in my mind about the ups and downs of the story structure and the use of tunes and syllables, and writing was relatively smooth. After finishing writing, the artists added or modified a few words or phrases, and it could be set to music. This is a very good method. I hope that the quyi research institutions can set up a training class, invite a few artists to teach us to speak and sing, and then we can write works for speaking and singing.

    (2) Sentences Must Be Separable: After learning, we can easily understand how to layout the story and how to use the tunes. The most difficult thing is probably sentence construction. We have to put a lot of effort into this point to get it close to right. "Speaking" is relatively easy, and there's no need to say more about it, but "singing" is a bit troublesome. We must first know that singing must be in rhyme, not just casual talk or everyday conversation. Therefore,

    "Little Gouzi and his brother Xiao Niu'er,
    Are twisting the Yangko dance on the snow in the yard." Although this sentence is written in separate lines, it is not in rhyme and cannot be sung—unless you find a musician to compose a new score; that would be outside the scope of our discussion now.

    Let's transform the previous two sentences. Look:

    "Niu'er Gouzi, two little brothers,
    Twisting the Yangko dance in the snowy yard." In this way, it can be sung—although it's not a very good sentence. Originally, the lyrics of folk quyi are made of local colloquial language, but they are influenced by old poetry—not new poetry. In the arrangement of tones in a sentence, it is not as strict as old poetry, but in order to be sung, each sentence sounds like old poetry. Separability makes it sound good. Look:

    "Niu'er  Gouzi  two little brothers
    Yard  snow  twisting Yangko" Each sentence can be cut into three sections, which gives it syllables. It sounds good to say, and it's easy to sing.

    Expanding the three-section method, you can have:

    "Big Niu'er  Second Gouzi  two brothers
    In the yard  on the snow  going to twist Yangko"

    Or:

    "Stupid Big Niu'er  Silly Second Gouzi  two little brothers
    Inside the yard  above the snow  twisting Yangko"

    Or… In short, separability means there is a way to sing; inseparability means there is no way—like: "Chiang Kai-shek can keep his head by running to Taiwan!"

    As mentioned earlier, the arrangement of tones in a sentence does not have to be as strict as old poetry, but it would be better if you could take this into account. Look:

    "Chicken duck fish meat fill the table,
    Delicacies of land and sea, everything complete." Singing is the same, but it is not as good as:

    "Chicken duck fish meat, everything there,
    Sea and land delicacies, everything complete." Although "delicacies of land and sea" is more readily available in spoken language than "sea and land delicacies." Of course, there is no big deal if someone insists on using "delicacies of land and sea."

    (3) Desperately Rhyming: Rhyming is the most headache-inducing thing. It often forces us to sacrifice good words and meanings in order to be consistent with the rhyme. However, if the rhyme is used wittily, its effect is far beyond what prose can achieve. Moreover, drum songs, fast storytelling, danxian, and number singing are fundamentally inseparable from rhyme, so we have to do it.

    Negatively, we should avoid those vocabularies that are not alive in spoken language but only exist in folk literature, such as "niang hang," "ma neng hang," "ma zou zhan," "kuai xie yun," etc.

    Negatively, we should not use half a word, such as "jianmie" (annihilate), but only "jian" (annihilate); "guancai" (coffin), but only "guan" (coffin). "Jianmie zhan" (annihilation war) is a new term, but the public can accept it if the whole word is used—the public's learning ability is not very small. On the contrary, if only one word "jian" is used for rhyming, like "dajun nanxia ba di jian" (the army goes south to annihilate the enemy), it is too literary and lacks power. You need to know that we should choose the most sonorous and obvious rhymes. If the sound and meaning of the words are slightly obscure, the singer will feel difficult, and the listener will not easily understand. In my "Passing the New Year" taiping lyrics, I originally had this sentence: "Burying alive saves a coffin." "Guancai" (coffin) is a common word, but I only used half of it. The rhyme is there, but it is a cripple. So, I changed it to: "Not burying alive, but chopping in half."

    Negatively, words that are not familiar to the public should not be used reluctantly due to the difficulty of rhyming. For example: I rarely use the word "ran." If I have to, I only choose the words "wangran," "buran," and "canran," which are commonly used in operas and songs, and not "qiran," "youran," and "turan." In "Passing the New Year," I wrote:

    The first day of the first month,
    Every family celebrates the New Year.
    How many injustices have occurred in ancient and modern times,
    They are even more apparent in the New Year. The first two sentences are commonly used in many drum lyrics and are not debatable. To transition into the main text, I had to add two sentences to connect the top and bottom. However, the fourth sentence looked more and more awkward and sounded more and more wrong. "Xianran" (apparent) is stiff and not very popular. I changed it again and again, but I could not replace it. So, I came up with another idea and changed the whole sentence to "The more the New Year, the more apparent." The sentence has two "yue" (more) characters, which is close to colloquial language and enough to reduce the sin of "xianran" (apparent). However, I am still dissatisfied with it to this day.

    Rhymes are also afraid of being forced. A good rhyme is like water flowing into a canal; a bad rhyme is like a duck climbing a tree. Beginners often repeat the last word of the sentence to make it rhyme, regardless of whether it makes sense. Like: Wang Er went up to the top of the mountain, Li Si touched his hair… This is not good. When you encounter this kind of sentence, it is best to rewrite it from scratch, and don't be lazy. Even if this kind of wording is used well, it is difficult to be praised; because two homophones are connected, it is not easy to stand firm. Since the rhyme is the foot, it must stand firm and not sway from side to side. Look:

    "The streetcar bell rings dangdang," is it good? Or:

    "The streetcar bell rings dingdang," is it good? When it comes to singing, "dingdang" gains an absolute advantage.

    The above is a negative indication of what we should avoid; now, let's talk about some positive things we should do.

    Yes, we should desperately rhyme, because the rhyme is the finishing touch in rhyming literature. If the rhyme is beautiful and readily available, the spirit of the whole sentence will be invigorated. If the rhyme is not sonorous and not readily available, the singer has no skills to use, and the listener feels suffocated. We should not take a routine and perfunctory attitude towards rhyming, but we must rack our brains and achieve unexpected success. I remember when I was in Chongqing, I wrote a section of "New Tying Dolls" for Mr. Fu Shaofang. Every time he used this act, the first clapper must be full of applause, and the second clapper is always uneventful. The first clapper is:

    "The second sister has another disease,
    She says she has a headache when she sees her lover,
    And it just so happens that she forgot to bring aspirin." In the past 20 years, aspirin has almost replaced panaceas. However, it has not yet entered the drum lyrics. After being used like this, it is both new and readily available; the singer blurted it out without any reluctance, and the listener couldn't help but shout "Good!"

    The second clapper is that Sister Liu Er went to visit the painting exhibition, pretending to be an expert, and expressed her opinion:

    "Oh, come and see,
    How red this plum blossom is painted!" I originally wanted to be witty about Liu Erjie's superficial ignorance—the quality of plum blossoms does not depend on whether they are painted red or not. And "red" is a heavy word in the Zhongdong rhyme. I thought that when this sentence was sung, it would definitely be applauded. However, no one in the audience cheered. The word "red" failed to fulfill its due responsibility, because it was not as readily available as the "ling" (efficacy) in aspirin, and the listener had to think for a long time to understand the reason. This thought delayed the applause!

    There are wide and narrow patterns in the thirteen rhymes. To be on the safe side, we should choose wide ones first, such as Zhongdong, Renchen, Jiangyang, Yanqian, etc. However, even if we use a wide rhyme, if we don't work hard to find words and don't work hard to change sentences, it is still (using the Zhongdong rhyme as an example) "zaiqizhong" (in it) every three sentences, "mei yingxiong" (beautiful hero) every two sentences, turning around, always those few words. If we are willing to search for folk witty sayings, allegorical sayings, and idioms, we (still using Zhongdong rhyme as an example) will even carry out words that are not easy to use, such as "cage" and "pit," like:

    "Still poor as before, still suffering as before,
    It's really like a nephew lighting a lantern." And

    "A radish for every pit."

    The rhyme is often not good because you want to write it all at once without careful deliberation. The best way to deliberate is not to think about only one word, but to change the sentence. Is "xiang" (fragrant) good, or is "fang" (fragrant) good? It's just a matter of one word. If the sentence is not good at all, replacing "fang" with "xiang" is still useless, although generally speaking, "xiang" is more readily available and louder than "fang." For example, we write:

    "The second sister is making fried tofu,
    The kitchen is full of fragrance." We immediately find that "penpen xiang" (full of fragrance) is not readily available, because we usually say "xiangpenpende" (fragrant), but rarely say "penpen xiang" (full of fragrance). If we stare at the word "xiang" to make an idea, we will have no way; replacing "xiang" with "fang" is even worse. If we move the sentences, we can get:

    "The fragrant tofu is fried in the pot,
    The smiling second sister is in the kitchen." In this way, we can also get several different sentences for us to choose from. Changing it again and again, moving in all directions, we can write drum lyrics and everything with rhyme into popular "poetry." We must regard ourselves as folk poets, and don't think that seven or eight characters per sentence, written in separate lines, will be all right.

    Generally, drum lyrics (not all danxian, etc. are like this) are in pairs, with the last word of the top sentence being a level tone, and the bottom sentence is a rising tone. Some people are very good at writing, but they do not distinguish between level and rising tones, so they cannot sing what they write. Slow work produces fine craftsmanship. Flip through the Mandarin Chinese dictionary (if writing in Beijing dialect). Don't be afraid of trouble. It is even more troublesome if you write something that cannot be sung.

    (4) Work Hard to Describe: Drum books and danxian are one-person dramas. The singer has to sing out the people, things, scenery, and emotions, sometimes with war drums rumbling, sometimes with insects chirping, sometimes civil, sometimes martial, sometimes with the hero's shortness of breath, and sometimes with the love of children. However, he must have a good script before he can do this. It is our responsibility to write a good script. We must describe the characters and scenes well, so that the artists can display their skills and sing a play with sound and color alone. Without description, there is no image, and it is empty and lifeless.

    The negative description should not fall into old patterns. The reason why folk literature sometimes appears mediocre and ordinary is because the young ladies from the Zhou Dynasty to the present have willow-leaf eyebrows and almond-shaped eyes; the generals have tiger backs and bear waists; in terms of clothing, Zhao Yun represents the silver-robed warrior, and Zhang Fei represents the black-faced general, so how many warriors and fierce generals are made from the same mold as Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei. Our young ladies today do not regard willow-leaf eyebrows and almond eyes as beautiful, and our generals do not wear gold armor and helmets; we must use our own pens to depict new characters. Similarly, our people today are not twelve feet tall, and they cannot lift a thousand pounds. We might as well be scientific and not exaggerate too much.

    Exaggeration, however, is not completely unnecessary. In order to make the characters stand out, we may exaggerate a little, but don't overdo it.

    It is very difficult to describe characters and scenery simply and vividly. Before writing, we must be fully prepared, passing the characters through our minds countless times according to the results of our observations. After writing, we must change it again and again. It is best to equip the scenery with stories, such as the fog of the Straw Boats Borrowing Arrows and the rain of the Imperial Stele Pavilion must be written. There is no need to write general scenery, such as green hills and green water, and willow darkness and flower brightness. The description is to attract people, to see its people, such as to enter its realm, rather than to show literary talent and move a large pile of rhetoric.

    Drum lyrics without stories are the most difficult to write, but not absolutely impossible. As long as the language is truly popular, truly simple, and truly natural, even preaching can succeed.

    The above is all about techniques; as for how correct the ideology is and what should be promoted, that is another issue, and I will not go into details.

### 习作新曲艺的一些小经验

　　习作新曲艺的一些小经验
    老舍
    根据我自己习作通俗曲艺的经验，提出下列应该注意的几点，供大家参考：
    （一）把握形式：在民间通行的曲艺里，不要说是唱的，就是说的也有一定的技巧与形式。我们的新诗须改成鼓词或小曲才能唱，我们的新小说须改成评书才能说。这就是说，我们必须利用民间曲艺的技巧与形式，才能把我们的作品说给或唱给人民听。所以，要为人民制作曲艺，我们就必须先把握住曲艺的形式。
    当然，我们可以创造新形式。但这问题不是我在这里所要说的。
    最妥当的办法是要写鼓词，就先去和艺人学一两段鼓词；要写金钱板就先学会一两段金钱板。我们自己，即使是粗枝大叶的，若能说或唱一两段老玩艺儿，赶到写制这路东西的时候，就方便多多了。
    在抗日战争中，我认识了唱京音大鼓的富少舫先生和唱犁铧大鼓的董莲枝女士。他们请求我给写新词，我要求他们先教我唱一两段。他们真的教给了我两段最长最难学的鼓书。这点工夫没白费。等到我提笔试写的时节，我心中对故事的起落结构及腔调音节的运用已大致的都有个谱儿，写起来比较顺利。写完，经艺人们再增添或改动几句或几个字便可以安腔入弦了。这是个很不错的办法，我希望曲艺研究机关能立个讲习班，请几位艺人教给我们说说唱唱，而后我们再写说说唱唱的作品。
    （二）句子要切得开：学习了之后，我们很容易的理会到：故事怎么布局，腔调如何运用。最难的恐怕是造句了，我们在这一点上要下很大很大的工夫才能弄得差不离。“说”的较比容易，不在话下，“唱”的可有点麻烦。我们首先要知道：唱的须是韵文，不是随便信口开河，说家常话儿。因此，
    “小狗子和他哥哥小牛儿，
    在院子里的雪地上正扭秧歌。”这么一句，虽然分行写出，可并不是韵文，不能够唱——除非找音乐家另作新谱；那可就出了咱们现在正谈论的范围。
    让咱们把前边的两句改造一下吧。看：
    “牛儿狗子小哥俩，
    院中雪地扭秧歌。”这么一来，可就能唱了——尽管不是很好的句子。原来，民间曲艺的词句虽然是用土语白话造成的，可是它却受了旧诗——不是新诗——的影响。在一句的平仄排列上，它不像旧诗那样的严格，可是为了能唱，它的每一句都像旧诗似的那么会出声儿。切得开就会出声。看：
    “牛儿  狗子  小哥俩
    院中  雪地  扭秧歌”每句都能切成三段，这就有了音节，说也好听，唱也好唱。
    把三段切法扩大，可以有：
    “大牛儿  二狗子  弟兄两个
    院子里  雪地上  去扭秧歌”
    或：
    “笨大牛儿  傻二狗子  小哥俩
    院子里头  雪地上面  扭秧歌”
    或……总而言之，切得开即有办法唱，切不开没办法——像：“蒋匪介石呀跑到台湾就能保住脑袋吗！”
    前面说过，一句中的平仄排列不必像旧诗那么严格，可是若能顾到这一点就更好。看：
    “鸡鸭鱼肉摆满案，
    山珍海味样样全。”唱是一样能唱，可就不如：
    “鸡鸭鱼肉桩桩有，
    海味山珍样样全。”虽然“山珍海味”在口语中比“海味山珍”更现成一点。自然，有人一定非用“山珍海味”不可，也没有多大的关系。
    （三）拚命押韵：押韵（辙）是最使人头疼的事。它往往教我们因顾及合辙押韵，不能不牺牲了很好的字眼和意思。可是，辙若用得俏皮，它的效果就远非散文所能及。况且，大鼓，快书，单弦，以及数唱，根本非有辙不可，我们也就只好照办，责无旁贷了。
    消极的，我们应当避免那些并不活在口语中，而只寄生在民间文艺的词汇，像娘行，马能行，马走战，快些云等。
    消极的，我们不该用半个词，像“歼灭”，而只用“歼”；“棺材”，而只用“棺”。“歼灭战”是个新名词，可是用此全词，民众能够接受——民众的学习能力并不很小。反之，若单用一个“歼”字押韵，像“大军南下把敌歼”便嫌太文，而且没有力量。要知道，我们选择韵脚须越响亮明显越好。字音字义稍一晦涩，唱的人便感到困难，听的人便不易理会。在我的“过新年”太平歌词里，我原有这么一句：“活埋省下一口棺。”“棺材”是通用的一词，我却只用了它的一半。韵有了，而是个瘸子。于是，我就改上：“不是活埋，就是铡成两半边。”
    消极的，不是民众所熟习的词汇，不能因押韵的困难而勉强去用。举例说：我轻易不用“然”字。必不得已，我只拣大戏与曲子里惯用的“枉然”，“不然”，和“惨然”，而不用“凄然”，“悠然”，和“徒然”。在“过新年”中，我这么写：
    大年初一头一天，
    家家户户过新年。
    古往今来多少不平的事，
    一到新年更显然。头两句是许多鼓词中惯用的话，没有什么可挑剔。为转入正文，我必须用两句话垫上，以便承上起下。可是，第四句越看越别扭，越念越不对劲。“显然”生硬，不很通俗。我改了再改，而始终换不掉它。于是，另生一计，把全句改成“越到新年越显然。”一句有两个“越”字，近乎口语，足以减轻“显然”的罪过。可是，到今天我还对它不满。
    韵脚也怕硬凑。韵押得好，是水到渠成；押得不好，是鸭子上树。初学者往往重述句子的末一字，使之成韵，不管通不通。像：王二上了山巅巅，李四摸着发尖尖……。这不好。遇到这种句子，顶好是从新写过，不可偷懒。这种用字法，即使用得不错，也难得叫好；因为两个同音字相连，不易立得牢稳。韵脚既是脚，就必须立得住，不东摇西摆。看：
    “电车铃儿响当当，”好？还是：
    “电车铃儿响叮当，”好？赶到唱起来的时候，“叮当”就取得绝对的优势。
    以上是消极的指出我们应避免什么；现在，我们说些积极的应作些什么。
    是的，我们应当拚命去押韵，因为韵脚是韵文中画龙点睛的地方。韵押得漂亮，现成，则全句的精神为之一振。韵押得不响亮，不现成，则唱者无技可施，听者感到闷气。对押韵，我们不该取照例公事，随便敷衍的态度，而是要煞费苦心，出奇致胜。记得在重庆的时候，我给富少舫先生写过一段“新拴娃娃”。每逢他使这段活的时候，第一个摔板必得满堂彩，第二个摔板永远若无其事。第一个摔板是：
    “二姐另有一宗病，
    见了情人先说头疼，
    又恰巧忘带了阿司匹灵。”阿司匹灵，在近二十年来，差不多已代替了万应锭。可是，它还没入过鼓词。经这么一用，它就既新颖，又现成；唱者脱口而出，毫无勉强，听者不由的叫出“好”来。
    第二个摔板是刘二姐去参观图画展览会，假充行家，发表了意见：
    “哎呀你们来看哪，
    这一枝梅花画得多么红！”我原来是要俏皮刘二姐的浅薄无知——梅花的好坏，不在乎画得红不红。而且“红”在中东辙里又是个有分量的字。我想，这一句一唱出来，必能得到喝彩。可是，台下没有一个叫好的。这个“红”字没能负起它应尽的责任，因为它不像阿司匹灵的“灵”那么现成，听者得想半天才能悟出道理来。这一想呀可就耽误了喝彩哟！
    十三套辙里有宽有窄、为保险一点，我们应先挑选宽的用，如中东，人臣，江洋，言前等辙。不过，即使用了宽辙，我们若不努力去找字，不努力去调换句子，还是（以用中东辙说吧）三句一个“在其中”，两句一个“美英雄”，翻来复去，老是那么几个字。假若我们肯下心去搜寻民间的俏皮话，歇后语，成语，我们（还以中东辙来说）就会连“笼”，“坑”，等不易用的字也搬运出来，像：
    “照旧（舅）穷来照旧苦，
    真是外甥打灯笼。”和
    “一个萝卜一个坑。”
    韵押不好，往往是因为要一气写成，不肯细心推敲。推敲的办法最好不要只在一个字上着想，而须改动句子。是“香”好呢，还是“芳”好呢，只是一个字的问题。若是句子根本不行，把“芳”换上“香”仍然没用，虽然大致的说，“香”比“芳”更现成，更响亮一些。比如说，我们写到：
    “二嫂正作炒豆腐，
    厨房里面喷喷香。”我们就立刻发现“喷喷香”不现成，因为我们平常总说“香喷喷的”，而不大说“喷喷香”。假若我们死盯住香字打主意，我们就毫无办法；把“香”换成了“芳”就更糟。假若我们调动调动句子呢，我们就可以得到：
    “香喷喷的豆腐锅里炒，
    笑眯眯的二嫂在厨房。”照这样，我们还可以得到好几样不同的句子，任我们选择。改了再改，四面八方的调动，我们才能把鼓词和一切上韵的东西写成为通俗的“诗”。我们必须自居为民间诗人，而不要以为七八个字一句，分开行写，就诸事大吉了。
    一般的鼓词（单弦等不都这样）都是上下句儿，上句末一字用仄声的字，下句的平声。有的人很能写，但不辨平仄，于是写出来不能唱。慢工出巧匠，多翻翻国语字典（假若用京语写作）就行了。别怕麻烦，写成而不能唱就更麻烦。
    （四）要努力描写：鼓书单弦等是一个人的戏剧。唱者一个人要把人，事，景，情，都唱出来，忽而战鼓咚咚，忽而虫声唧唧，忽而文，忽而武，忽而英雄气短，忽而儿女情长。可是，他必须有好本子，然后才能这样作。写好本子是我们的责任。我们必须把人物，情景，描写得好，艺人才能施展本事，独自有声有色的唱一出戏。没有描写，即无形象，也就空洞无物。
    描写要消极的不落旧套。民间文艺之所以有时候显出庸凡，就因为自周朝到现在的小姐们都是柳叶眉，杏核眼；大将都是虎背熊腰；在服装上，赵云代表银袍勇将，张飞代表黑脸将军，于是多少多少勇将和猛将都和赵云张飞是一个模子磕出来的。我们今天的小姐既不以柳眉杏眼为美，我们的大将也不穿戴金甲金盔；我们得用自己的笔描画新的人物。同样的，我们今天的人既不身高丈二，也不能力举千斤。我们不妨科学一点，勿过于夸大。
    夸大，可是，不是完全要不得的。为使人物突出，我们不妨夸大一点，可就是别太过火了。
    描写人物风景要简单而能生动，这是很不易作到的。在下笔之前，我们要有充分的准备，把人物依着观察的结果在心中通过多少多少遍，写完，要改了再改。写景最好配备着故事，草船借箭的雾，御碑亭的雨是非写不可的。泛泛的写景，如青山绿水，柳暗花明，大可不必。描写是为引人入胜，如见其人，如临其境，而不是为显露文才，搬来一大堆修词的东西。
    没有故事的鼓词等最难写，而不是绝对不能写。只要语言真能通俗，真能深入浅出，真能自然现成，就是说教讲理还能成功。
    以上所述，都是关于技巧的；至于思想如何正确，应当宣传什么，是另一问题，恕不多赘。
