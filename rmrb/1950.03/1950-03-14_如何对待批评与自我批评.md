　　How to Treat Criticism and Self-Criticism

    Soviet newspapers must broadly enlighten all aspects of our country and the lives of our people. The Central Committee of the Party requires the editorial departments of newspapers and magazines, and Soviet journalists, to be proficient in Bolshevik publishing, to vividly reflect the heroic daily life of our country, to pay attention to and closely grasp all new and progressive affairs, and to fight with Bolshevik passion against the old remnants, procrastination, adherence to conventions, bureaucracy, and everything that hinders our victorious advance.
      (Excerpt from the May 5, 1948, "Pravda" editorial)
    Party newspapers should become combat-effective Party newspapers, and there should be appropriate and correct self-criticism, praising the advantages in work, criticizing the errors in work, and guiding the work in all aspects through the newspapers. (Excerpt from "The CCP Central Committee's Notification on Transforming Party Newspapers")
    Newspapers play a very important role in launching criticism and self-criticism. Criticism in newspapers, which publicizes the shortcomings and errors of a certain staff member in practical work, is the most effective method of educating cadres. The special significance of criticism in newspapers also lies in its attracting the broad masses of workers to participate in the struggle against errors and shortcomings, thus becoming a powerful tool for launching bottom-up criticism and self-criticism.

    To treat criticism and self-criticism with a Party attitude means, first of all, to have the courage to openly admit one's mistakes and make all necessary efforts to quickly eliminate them. Comrade Stalin said: "Not to conceal one's mistakes, not to evade questions about one's mistakes, as we often do, but to sincerely and openly admit one's mistakes, to sincerely and openly find ways to correct these mistakes, and to sincerely and openly correct one's mistakes - this is the duty of a Bolshevik."
    But not everyone has learned this attitude toward criticism everywhere. We often encounter staff members who are unwilling to listen to the voice of the masses, do not consider criticism from below, and hinder the development of criticism. Devoted to a calm and peaceful life, these staff members avoid any words of criticism in their speeches. This is a non-Party attitude toward criticism. The Party has always resolutely rebuked those staff members who try to evade self-criticism, overthrow or weaken it. As early as 1928, Comrade Stalin said: "I know that there are still people in the Party ranks who do not like criticism at all, especially self-criticism. These people I can call 'lacquered' communists, they often clamor, waving away self-criticism: he said, it is this damned self-criticism again, again exposing our shortcomings, can't we let us live in peace? Obviously, these 'lacquered' communists have nothing in common with the spirit of our Party, with the spirit of Bolshevism." ("Complete Works of Stalin" Russian edition, Volume 11, page 28)
    The Party's attitude toward criticism and self-criticism requires not only admitting mistakes: after admitting mistakes, one should then correct them, which is the purpose of criticism and self-criticism. However, sometimes we encounter staff members who only admit shortcomings verbally and formally, promising to correct them... but in reality, they continue to work in the same old way. A formal response to criticism hinders a certain organization from correcting specific shortcomings in its work, reduces the enthusiasm of the group in fighting against shortcomings, and restricts its energy and initiative.
    Comrade Zhdanov emphasized the great significance of each Bolshevik staff member treating their own undertakings with a strict self-critical attitude in his report on the "Star" and "Leningrad" magazines. He said: "Comrade Stalin has repeatedly pointed out that the most important condition for our development is to ensure that every one of our Soviet people summarizes their work every day, checks themselves without fear, analyzes their work, bravely criticizes their shortcomings and errors, carefully considers how they can make their work better and continuously improve themselves. ... Whoever is afraid to criticize their own work is a despised coward, and is not worthy of the respect of the people."

　　如何对待批评与自我批评
    苏联报纸务须广泛地启发我国以及我国人民生活的各方面。党中央要求报纸杂志的编辑部，要求苏维埃的新闻工作者，要精通布尔什维克出版业务，要鲜明地反映我国英勇的日常生活，注意并紧紧抓住一切新的、进步的事务，以布尔什维克的激情，和旧的残余，和拖延、墨守成规、官僚主义，和一切阻碍我们胜利前进的事物作斗争。
      （摘自一九四八年五月五日“真理报”社论）
    党报要成为战斗性的党报，就要有适当的正确的自我批评，表扬工作中的优点，批评工作中的错误，经过报纸来指导各方面的工作。（摘自“中共中央宣传部为改造党报的通知”）
    报纸在展开批评与自我批评上起很重要的作用。报纸上的批评，公布某工作人员在实际工作中的缺点和错误，乃是教育干部的最有效的方法。报纸上的批评之具有特别重大的意义，还在于它吸引了广大劳动群众来参加与错误和缺点作斗争，因而成为展开自下而上的批评和自我批评的强有力的工具。
  （摘自Ｐ·卡尔宁“批评与自我批评——布尔什维克的培养干部的方法”）×  ×  ×    ×
    以党的态度对待批评和自我批评，就是首先要有勇气公开承认自己的错误，并作出为了迅速消除它所需要的一切。斯大林同志说：“不是隐瞒自己的错误，不是讳言有关自己错误的问题，如我们经常所有的，而是诚恳和公开地承认自己的错误，诚恳而公开地找出纠正这些错误的道路，诚恳而公开地纠正自己的错误，——这是布尔什维克的责任。”
    可是还不是到处都学会了这种对待批评的态度。我们还经常碰到这种工作人员，他不愿倾听群众的呼声，不考虑来自下面的批评，阻滞批评的发展。倾心于平静的、安宁的生活，这些工作人员在自己的发言中避开任何批评的字眼。这是非党的对待批评的态度。党经常坚决地斥责那些试图逃避自我批评，推翻或削弱它的工作人员。还在一九二八年时斯大林同志就说道：“我知道在党的队伍中还有这样的人，他全然不喜欢批评，特别是自我批评。这些人我可以称呼为‘漆涂的’共产主义者，他们常常嚷着，挥开自我批评：他说，又是这个该死的自我批评，又是揭露我们的缺点，难道不能让我们安安生生过日子吗？显而易见的，这些‘漆涂的’共产主义者是同我们党的精神，同布尔什维克的精神没有任何共同之处的。”（“斯大林全集”俄文本第十一卷第二八页）
    对待批评和自我批评的党的态度，不只要求承认错误：承认错误之后就应当跟着纠正它，这是批评和自我批评的目的。然而有时也会碰到这样的工作人员，他们只限于口头上、形式上承认缺点，答应要改正它……而实际上却继续照老样子工作。对于批评的形式的反应，阻碍了某一组织纠正工作中的具体缺点，降低了集团在同缺点作斗争时的积极性，束缚了他的精力、主动性。
    日丹诺夫同志在关于“星”和“列宁格勒”杂志的报告中强调指出了每个布尔什维克的工作人员，以严格的自我批评的态度对待自己事业的重大意义。他说：“斯大林同志曾经屡次地指出，我们发展的最重要的条件，就必须使得我们每一个苏联人民，每天将自己的工作做一个总结，毫不害怕地检查自己，分析自己的工作，勇敢地批评自己的缺点和错误，周密地考虑怎样可以使自己的工作作到更好的成绩，和不间断地使自己更加臻于完善。……谁害怕批评自己的工作，谁就是遭人鄙视的懦夫，谁就不配受到人民的尊敬。”
    （摘自Ｐ·卡尔宁“批评与自我批评——布尔什维的培养干部的方法”）
