　　Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative Reverses Conservative Thinking
    Boldly Promotes Sales to Accelerate National Capital Turnover
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has changed its old business policy, boldly promoted the sale of inventory, thereby clearing a large number of loans owed to the National Bank and eliminating the phenomenon of capital backlog. According to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on unifying national financial and economic work, the cooperative has held three consecutive cadre meetings since March 16 to review its past erroneous conservative thinking, decentralized management methods, and the phenomenon of capital backlog. It then quickly transformed, formulating plans to promote the sale of inventory, repay debts on schedule, unify control of cash, concentrate the use of funds, and unify purchasing, sales, and allocation of materials.
    These tasks have been successively started and have achieved considerable results. First, the cooperative arranged for study and vigorously carried out ideological work against conservatism among cadres. Subsequently, sales operations were launched. As of the 26th, inventory worth 5.2553 billion yuan has been sold, completing 55% of the original sales target. This payment has been used to repay 2 billion yuan owed for Northeast grain and 2.00264 billion yuan to the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank. According to the person in charge of the cooperative's business department, it is estimated that the original plan to repay the bank loans before April 15 can be completed as scheduled, based on the amount of inventory and the sales situation in the past two weeks.
    The cooperative's unified cash management work is carried out in two stages. Currently, the business section of the general cooperative uniformly concentrates the daily sales cash of its subordinate business units (stores, grain and cargo stations, etc. and suburban branches), stipulating that all must be remitted to the business section before 8:00 am the next morning (branches in Mentougou, Changxindian, Shijingshan, Fengtai and other places will transfer payment to the local People's Bank offices), and uniformly repaid to the bank. After the debt is repaid, the financial accounting section of the cooperative will continue to take charge; the payment for goods of each unit can be included in the account opened by the general cooperative in the National Bank on a daily basis. Suburban branches shall not open separate accounts.
    With the unified management of cash, a method of unified purchasing, sales, and allocation of goods by the general cooperative has been determined, stipulating that all branch units shall stop independent procurement. The inventory of goods shall be checked within a time limit, and the general cooperative shall allocate and adjust them according to the quantity, to reduce the blindness of purchasing and accelerate the turnover of goods.
    After the transformation of business operations and financial work and the implementation of new business policies, the cooperative released a huge amount of funds from the National Bank. Not only can business be carried out as usual, but also, due to the general cooperative's control of the unified purchasing, sales, and allocation of goods, business planning has also been significantly enhanced, and the phenomenon of blind purchasing that does not meet the needs of cooperative members has begun to be overcome.

　　京供销总社扭转保守思想
    大胆销售加速国家资金流转
    【本报讯】北京市供销合作总社改变旧的经营方针，大胆销售存货，从而清偿了所欠国家银行等大批借款，消除了积压资金的现象。该社根据中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，从三月十六日起相继举行干部会议三次，检讨出以往错误的保守的思想、分散经营的方式，和积压资金的现象。随即迅速转变，订出推销存货、定期还清欠款、统一掌握现金、集中使用资金，统一购销及调拨物资计划。
    这些工作均已相继开始，并获得相当成绩。首先，该社曾布置了学习，大力在干部中进行反对保守主义的思想。随即展开推销业务。截至二十六日，已销出价值五十二亿五千五百三十余万元的存货，完成原定销货量百分之五十五。此项货款除归还所欠东北粮款二十亿元外，并归还人民银行合作部二十亿零二千六百四十余万元。根据该社业务部门负责人谈：依存货数量及近两周推销情况估计，原定四月十五日以前归还银行款项的计划，可如期完成。
    该社统一掌握现金工作，分两个阶段进行。目前由总社业务科统一集中所属各经营单位（门市部、粮货栈等及郊区各分社）每日售货现金，规定一律于次日上午八时前汇交业务科（门头沟、长辛店、石景山、丰台等地分社交当地人民银行办事处转账），统一归还银行。俟欠款还清后，改由该社财务会计科继续掌握；各单位的货款可逐日纳入总社于国家银行开立之户头。各郊区分社不得另行开户。
    随着现金的统一管理，并确定了由总社统一购、销、调拨货物的办法，规定各分支单位一律停止单独采购。其库存货物限期查清，由总社根据多、少、有、无加以调拨调剂，以减少进货的盲目性和加速货物的流转。
    该社在业务经营和财务工作转变及实行了新的经营方针后，腾出了国家银行的巨量资金，不但业务还可以照常进行，同时，由于总社掌握货物的统一购、销和调拨，业务计划性亦显著增强，开始克服了若干不切合社员需要而盲目进货的现象。（宇）
