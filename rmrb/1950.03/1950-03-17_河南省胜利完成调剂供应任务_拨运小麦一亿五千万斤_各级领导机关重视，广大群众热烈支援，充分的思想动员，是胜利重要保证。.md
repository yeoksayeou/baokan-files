Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th: Henan Province has successfully completed the task of transferring 150 million jin of wheat to support grain supplies in neighboring areas. A total of more than 350,000 workers participated in the transportation work. Starting from December 20th of last year, this batch of grain was transported by the province's Grain Transportation Command and the Tianjin Transfer Station via the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways. At that time, it was the height of winter, with wind, snow, and muddy roads, but the people and cadres who participated in this work overcame various difficulties such as insufficient manpower and materials, and unfamiliarity with transportation operations. They gloriously completed the transportation of a huge amount of grain in a short period of forty days.

The important guarantee for Henan Province to complete this task was, first of all, that the leading organs at all levels in the province attached great importance to the grain transportation work, recognizing its importance to overcoming the country's financial difficulties, and formed a Grain Transportation Command to uniformly lead the province's grain transportation work. The Henan Provincial People's Government fully guaranteed the on-time completion of the grain transportation, treating it as a task to support the front lines. During this period, it mobilized more than 900 cadres at all levels to participate in this work. The Railway Bureau took the initiative to contact the command and, in addition to regularly ensuring the allocation of 75 to 80 train cars per day for transportation, also frequently assisted with loading and unloading. The public security departments also made their best efforts to protect the grain, with Xuchang Prefecture alone deploying 288 people to guard the grain.

The Broad Masses Completed Grain Transportation in Rain and Snow, Viewing it as Supporting the Front

The second guarantee for completing the task was the enthusiastic support of the broad masses for the grain transportation work. Because Henan Province had been liberated for a relatively long time, the political awareness of the masses was generally improved. Therefore, once the grain transportation task was assigned by governments at all levels, a large amount of transportation power in the relevant counties, districts, and townships was quickly mobilized and organized. According to incomplete statistics, during the grain transportation period, the number of workers mobilized along the Beijing-Hankou Railway alone reached 356,750, with more than 29,190 vehicles and more than 360 boats. Despite the rain and snow, they participated in the grain transportation without complaint. For every hundred jin of grain transported one hundred li, an average of sixteen to thirty jin of miscellaneous grains could be earned as freight, depending on the tools and manpower. Under the conditions of difficult rural transportation, some people carried it by shoulder, some pushed it by cart, and some carried it by mules, all delivering public grain to the designated locations on time. On the workers' side, under the leadership of the trade union, they not only loaded and unloaded grain without delay, but their wages were also lower than normal commercial transportation, completing the grain transportation as a task to support the front lines. The third important guarantee for completing the task was that a full ideological mobilization was carried out beforehand, so that every worker recognized the importance of the grain transportation task and developed a high degree of responsibility. Most people were able to work hard, endure hardship, and persevere in their work, and the cadres took great care of the civilian workers. In addition, the leadership was more in-depth, praising the good and criticizing the bad in a timely manner, which further strengthened everyone's confidence in overcoming difficulties and constantly maintained full enthusiasm, so that the work tasks could be successfully completed. In the grain transportation work, the Henan Provincial Grain Transportation Command and the Tianjin Transfer Station gave play to the enthusiasm of the staff, carefully studied various specific businesses to improve work efficiency, and carried out scientific division of labor. Therefore, the work efficiency was very high, and they tried every means to protect the grain to avoid various losses. This grain transportation resulted in very little loss. The three grain depots transported a total of 155,256,5384 jin of wheat, with a total loss of 249,676 jin, and the loss rate was only 0.16%.

Still Need to Improve the Careless Work Style, Deepen Leadership, and Solve Problems in a Timely Manner

The Henan Provincial Grain Transportation Command and the Tianjin Transfer Station have now summarized their experiences and believe that although there have been the above-mentioned achievements in the past work, there are still many shortcomings. First, the leadership is not in-depth enough to the lower levels to solve problems in a timely manner, resulting in inconsistent wages for workers in some places. Second, there is still a careless work style. For example, on January 6, the Third Receiving Station sent 15 train cars of grain to Tianjin, originally sending 17,950 bags, but after inspection, 85 bags were sent more, but the actual amount of grain received was 8,841 jin less. Third, losses that should not have occurred were suffered due to entrusting private merchants with the transfer and trusting them when receiving grain. For example, when transferring grain in Beijing, Tianjin, Cangxian and other places, the grain company did not pay enough attention, and the grain was collected by grain merchants or flour companies, resulting in very chaotic order. On January 14, Gao Lian Gong, an escort from the Second Receiving Station, escorted four train cars of grain to Tianjin for delivery. Because the grain was collected by private merchants, more than 3,500 jin of wheat were short (later found and made up in full). After reviewing the above shortcomings, they are studying ways to improve them in order to welcome new receiving and transportation tasks in the future.

### 河南省胜利完成调剂供应任务  拨运小麦一亿五千万斤  各级领导机关重视，广大群众热烈支援，充分的思想动员，是胜利重要保证。

　　河南省胜利完成调剂供应任务
    拨运小麦一亿五千万斤
    各级领导机关重视，广大群众热烈支援，充分的思想动员，是胜利重要保证。
    【新华社汉口十六日电】河南省已胜利完成拨运一亿五千万斤小麦调剂友邻区粮食供应的任务，参加运输工作的劳动群众先后共达三十五万余人。从去年十二月二十日起，这批粮食由该省运粮指挥部和天津转运总站负责经由京汉、陇海两线起运。当时适值严冬，风雪交加，道路泥泞，但参加这一工作的人民和干部终于克服了人力、物力不足、运输业务不熟悉等种种困难，在短促的四十天中光荣地完成了巨额粮食的运输任务。
    河南省完成这一任务的重要保证，首先是该省各级领导机关极重视运粮工作，认识到这一工作对于克服国家财政困难的重要性，并组成运粮指挥部统一领导全省运粮工作。河南省人民政府把运粮当成支援前线的任务一样全力保证其按期完成，其间曾动员各级干部九百多人参加这一工作。铁路局方面主动与指挥部联系，除经常保证每天拨给七十五至八十辆车皮运输外，且经常协助装卸。公安部门也尽了最大努力，做好护粮工作，许昌一个专区就配备了二百八十八人看守粮食。
    广大人民当作支前任务在雨雪交加中完成运粮
    完成任务的第二个保证，就是运粮工作得到了广大群众的热烈支援，由于河南省解放较久，群众政治觉悟程度普遍提高，故一经各级政府把运粮任务布置之后，各有关县、区、乡大批运输力即被迅速动员组织起来。据不完全统计，运粮期间仅在京汉铁路沿线各站动员的劳动群众即达三十五万六千七百五十余人、车辆二万九千一百九十余辆、船三百六十多只。虽雨雪交加，他们亦不辞辛劳地参加运粮。每一百斤粮运一百里，视工具人力的不同平均可得十六斤至三十斤杂粮的运费。在农村交通困难的条件下，有的由人挑，有的用车推，有的用骡驮，均按规定时间运送公粮陆续集中到指定地点。而工人方面在工会领导下，不仅装卸粮食不误时间，其工资且低于寻常商运，把运粮当做支援前线任务来完成。完成任务的第三个重要保证，是事先进行了充分的思想动员，使每个工作人员认识到运粮任务的重要性，发挥了高度的负责精神；多数人员都能刻苦耐劳、坚持工作，干部对民工备加爱护；再加领导较深入，及时表扬好的，批评坏的，更加强了大家战胜困难的信心，经常保持饱满的热情，使工作任务得以顺利完成。河南省运粮指挥部及天津转运总站在运粮工作上，由于发挥了工作人员的积极性，为提高工作效率，缜密地研究了各种具体业务，进行科学分工，故工作效率很高，并又想尽办法保护粮食，以避免各种损失，使这次运粮损耗甚少，计三个粮栈运完一亿五千二百五十六万五千三百八十四斤小麦，共脱耗二十四万九千六百七十六斤，脱耗比率仅为万分之十六。
    仍须改进粗枝大叶作风深入领导及时解决问题
    河南省运粮指挥部及天津转运总站现已总结经验，认为过去工作中虽有上述成绩，但尚存在很多缺点，第一，领导尚不够深入下层及时解决问题，致有的地方工人工资不统一；第二，工作作风上尚有粗枝大叶，如第三接运站一月六日往天津发粮十五车，原发袋子一万七千九百五十袋，后经检查多发了八十五袋，但粮食实收数却短少八千八百四十一斤；第三，转运时委托私商，收粮时轻信他们，致遭受了一些不应有的损失。如在京、津、沧县等地转交粮食时，因粮食公司重视不够，收粮全由粮商或面粉公司代收，秩序非常混乱，一月十四日第二接运栈押运员高连功押粮四车皮到天津交解，因由私商收粮，短少麦子达三千五百多斤（后经查明如数补上）。以上缺点经检讨后，正研究改进办法，以迎接今后新的接运任务。
