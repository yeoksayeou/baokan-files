　　Four Hundred Farmers in Liubao Village, Yuci, Shanxi Begin Year-Round Cultural Studies
	After Illiterate People Complain and Learning Experience Introduced, Nine-Tenths of the Village's Young Adults Participate in People's Schools
	[This newspaper dispatch] Correspondents Li Bin, Dong Lifa, and Guo Yongtai report: The winter school in Liubao Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, officially transitioned to a people's school on the 15th. Four hundred and four young adult male and female farmers (accounting for 89% of the village's total young adult population) have begun long-term, planned cultural studies.
	Liubao Village is one of the experimental villages for winter schools in the new district. It established its first winter school last winter. The winter school had a total of 457 students, divided into three classes. The winter school in the village underwent rectification by the leading authorities, grasped the principle of prioritizing political education in the new district's winter schools, initially improved the students' political awareness, and also achieved considerable success in cultural education. Before mobilizing the transition to a year-round people's school focused on cultural studies, the school first launched a movement of illiterate people complaining about their suffering to deepen farmers' understanding of the literacy campaign. During the complaints, many farmers poured out the suffering they had endured due to not being able to receive education under long-term feudal oppression. For example, a woman named Yang Aichun said, "Before, I owed someone money and gave them a 500-yuan bill, thinking it was 5 yuan, and lost more than 10,000 yuan in total." The Chinese Communist Party branch secretary of the village, Li Tiesuo, said, "It's really hard to be a cadre if you can't read. When I go to the district for meetings, others rely on writing things down, but I have to rely on my memory." "When the district sends a notice, fills out a form, or issues a receipt, I have to find someone to do it for me everywhere; and I'm afraid they'll make mistakes, and I'm responsible." The Youth League branch secretary, Li Erwa, said, "I want to cry when I think about not being able to read! When we were doing propaganda performances during the New Year, others could recite the lines and learn quickly; but I couldn't. I was also afraid of hindering the leaders' work, and I was really worried." After the illiterate people complained about their suffering, the masses had a deeper understanding of the importance of literacy. At the same time, they also felt that the winter school study period was short and that they couldn't learn well, so they voluntarily proposed to turn the winter school into a year-round people's school. Most of the students were willing to enroll in the people's school. However, some students still had ideological concerns, thinking that "they are too old to learn well" and that "people over thirty can't learn skills," lacking confidence in learning. To this end, the village mobilized people with good cultural learning results in the winter school to talk about their learning achievements and experiences to encourage everyone's learning enthusiasm. For example, a woman named Zhao Junlin, who originally couldn't read a single word, finished the first volume of the literacy textbook in the winter school and could silently write fifty new words. She said, "I feel happier to be literate than anything else. I take the book with me even when I'm sitting and working, and I study whenever I have time, and I ask people who know how to read whenever I see them. As long as you put your heart into it, you can learn." A woman named Zhao Sixiang had a bad memory, and others thought that she "couldn't learn even if she tried, it would be a waste of effort," but she worked hard to learn, and now she also recognizes some new words. These people with good learning results were all very happy to talk about their experiences, and many people who had no confidence in learning and held a negative attitude towards learning felt very regretful after listening and expressed their desire to catch up on the spot.
　　Presenting Flowers, Awards, and Good News to Reward Winter School Learning Models
	At the same time, the village also held a meeting of winter school students and the masses, and commended, presented flowers, and awarded prizes to the nine models selected in the winter school movement. The two first-class learning models were also presented with good news announcements, and everyone felt very honored. From then on, these models became more active in both their own learning and in mobilizing the masses to learn. During the transition to the people's school, a new group of activists emerged, and their joint efforts made the work of the people's school proceed smoothly. Then, the village also specifically convened a meeting of learning models and activists to discuss the methods of combining production activities with leading the masses to learn in the people's school.
	Combining Production, Dividing into Classes and Groups, and Establishing a Year-Round Study Plan
	After the establishment of the Liubao Village People's School, all students discussed and established a year-round study plan and study methods. It is planned to have three months of vacation throughout the year (wheat harvest, autumn vacation, New Year's vacation), study for nine months, learn two new characters every day per person, learn 540 characters throughout the year, and strive to achieve the "four abilities" (ability to recognize, write, speak, and use). Students are divided into classes based on their level of testing and evaluation: those with the equivalent of a third or fourth grade elementary school level form a youth tutoring class, attached to the elementary school; literacy classes are divided into three classes: those who know less than 300 characters are in the "Volume One Class," those who know 300 to 600 characters are in the "Volume Two Class," and those who know 600 to 900 characters are in the "Volume Three Class." Students voluntarily form groups, with a limit of four to seven people per group. After the establishment of mutual aid teams in future production, the study groups will be adjusted separately according to the production organization. The entire school follows the original organization of the winter school, with classes held in three branch schools. The class time is adjusted according to the production season. Currently, it is tentatively decided that the literacy classes will meet six times a month, on the 5th and 10th of each month; all young adult students will attend political classes or receive production education on the 1st of each month. Men attend classes at night, and women attend classes at noon. It is also decided that if there is a reason for not being able to attend class, a leave of absence must be requested, and the missed class must be made up.
	In terms of teaching methods, the emphasis is on "people teaching people" and "mutual teaching and mutual learning." The "little teacher system" is used, with those who know more characters teaching those who know fewer. Each class checks and assigns learning tasks for five days before and after the class. Those who can complete the study plan on time and learn well are commended using blackboards and the radio station, and those who learn particularly poorly are appropriately criticized. In addition, it is proposed that students give each other "character gifts," use elementary school students to deliver characters, mobilize students to make small blackboards at home, and pay attention to daily learning.
	In order to strengthen the leadership of the people's school, the village established a "Mass Culture and Education Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy," composed of nine people, including the village chief, the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary, the education committee member, cadres from the Youth League and the Women's Federation who are enthusiastic and responsible for literacy learning, the people's school teachers, the elementary school principal, and the literacy models from the winter school. The committee has a principal (concurrently the village chief) and three branch principals are selected separately. It is decided to hold meetings every ten days to check and study the work of the people's school; and to submit a work report to the county every half month. All committee members and village cadres within the age of literacy are included in the literacy groups, and are assigned responsibilities to ensure that the group's learning is done well.
	The Chinese Communist Party branch and the Youth League branch in the village also convened meetings of party and league members to review the shortcomings of some party and league members who failed to play a real leading role in the winter school work; party members also studied the Xinxian Prefectural Committee's instructions on party members' literacy and the lesson "The Exemplary Role of Communist Party Members" in the party member textbook. Now all party members have established plans to lead the masses to learn through their own learning. In addition to participating in youth tutoring classes, some league members with higher levels of education will also establish plans to help the masses learn, as one of the league's tasks.
	Teachers Teach Classes, The Masses Reciprocate with Labor  The People's School Finances Are Solved Independently
	In addition, the village also discussed the treatment of people's school teachers, and decided that teachers would be credited with half a day's work for each class day (one class each for men and women); teachers would also be credited with work according to the actual amount if they leave the village for meetings on official business, and the masses would reciprocate with labor in the current month. The finances of the people's school were decided to be borne jointly by the students participating in the learning, and expenditure standards were established.

　　山西榆次六堡村四百农民开始常年文化学习
    经过文盲诉苦和学习经验介绍全村青壮年十分之九参加民校
    【本报讯】通讯员李彬、董力发、郭永太报道：山西省榆次县六堡村冬学已于十五日正式转为民校，四百零四名青壮年男女农民（占全村青壮年总数的百分之八十九）开始了长期的、有计划的文化学习。
    六堡村是新区冬学实验村之一，去冬首次建立冬学。冬学学员共四百五十七名，分在三处上课。该村冬学曾经领导机关的整顿，掌握了新区冬学以政治教育为主的方针，初步提高了学员们的政治觉悟，文化教育上亦获得了相当成绩。此次动员转入以文化学习为主的常年民校之前，该校为使农民对识字运动有深刻的认识，首先展开了一次文盲诉苦运动。在诉苦中，许多农民倾吐了在长期封建压迫之下不能受到教育而遗留至今的苦楚。如妇女杨爱春说：“先前我欠下人家的钱，拿五百元的票子当成五元给了人，共吃了一万多元的亏。”该村中共支部书记李铁锁说：“当干部不识字真是苦。到区开会，人家是凭字记，咱是凭心里记。”“区里来个通知，填个表，开个收条都得要到处找人弄；还怕别人弄错了，自己负责。”青年团支部书记李二娃说：“提起不识字就想哭！在年关时闹宣传演剧，人家都会念台词，学得快；咱不行。咱又怕领导不好工作，直发愁。”经过文盲诉苦之后，群众对识字的重要性有了更进一步的认识。同时，也感到冬学学习时期短，学不好，便自动提出要把冬学转为常年民校。大部分学员都愿意入民校学习。但一部分学员还存在思想顾虑，认为“年纪大了，学不好”，“人过三十不学艺”，学习信心不高。为此，该村又动员冬学中文化学习成绩较好的人谈自己的学习成绩和经验，以鼓励大家的学习情绪。如妇女赵俊林原来一字不识，在冬学中学完了识字课本第一册，能默写五十个生字，她说：“我觉得识字比什么都高兴。我是坐着做活都带着书本，有空就学，见识字的人就问。只要用心，就能学会。”妇女赵四香记性不好，别人都认为她“学也学不下，白搭工”，可是她努力学习，现在也认了一些生字了。这些学习有成绩的人都谈得很高兴，许多对学习没有信心，对学习抱消极态度的人听了都感到很后悔，当场表示要迎头赶上。
  献花发奖品送喜报奖励冬学学习模范
    同时，该村又召开了冬学学员和群众大会，对冬学运动中选出的九名模范进行了表扬、献花与发给奖品，两个一等学习模范并送了喜报，大家都感到很光荣。从此这些模范在自己学习与动员群众学习两方面都更加积极了。在转民校时，又出现了一批新的积极分子，由他们的共同推动，使民校工作进行顺利。接着，该村又专门召开了学习模范与积极分子会议，讨论了在民校中结合生产活动，带领群众学习的方法。
    结合生产分班编组订出全年学习计划
    六堡村民校成立后，即由全体学员讨论，订出了全年的学习计划和学习方法。预定全年放三个月假（麦收、秋假、年假），学习九个月，每人每日识两个字，全年学五百四十个字，并力求达到四会（会认、会写、会讲、会用）。学员根据测验与评定的程度分班：相当于初小三、四年级程度的组成青年补习班，附设在小学校内；识字班则编为三班：识字三百以下的为“一册班”，识三百至六百字的为“二册班”，识六百至九百字的为“三册班”。又由学员以自愿的方法结成小组，每组以四人至七人为限，在将来生产中成立变工组后，则根据生产组织另行调整学习小组。全校依原来冬学的组织，分三个分校上课，上课的时间随生产季节调整。现在暂定识字班每月逢五逢十共上课六次；全体青壮年学员逢一上政治课或进行生产教育。男人在黑夜上课，妇女中午上课。并决定有事不能上课必须请假，请假必须补课。
    在教学方法上，着重“以民教民”“互教互学”的办法。运用小先生制，由识字多的教识字少的，每次上课时检查并布置前后各五天的学习。对能按期完成学习计划与学习得好的利用黑板报和广播台进行表扬，对学习特别坏的予以适当批评。此外，并提出学员互相送“字礼”，利用小学生送字，发动学员每家做小黑板等，注意日常学习。
    为加强民校的领导，该村成立了“扫盲识字大众文教委员会”，由村长、中共支部书记、教育委员与青年团、妇联中对识字学习热心负责的干部、民校教员、小学校长和冬学中的识字模范等九人组成。委员会下设校长（村长兼），另选三个分校长。并决定每十天开会一次，检查研究民校的工作；每半月并向县作一次工作报告。凡在扫盲年龄以内的委员与村干部，均编入识字小组，分工负责，保证搞好小组的学习。
    该村中共支部与青年团支部，并召集党团员举行了会议检讨了一部分党团员在冬学工作中未能起到真正的带头作用的缺点；党员并学习了忻县地委对党员识字的指示与党员课本中《共产党员的模范作用》一课。现全村党员都订了计划，决定以自己的学习来带领群众学习。一部分文化程度较高的团员，除参加青年补习班学习外，并要订出计划，帮助群众学习，以此作为团的工作之一。
  教员上课群众还工  民校经费自己解决
    此外，该村并讨论了对民校教员的待遇，决定教员每逢上课日（男、女班各上一次），记半个工；教员如因公出村开会，亦照实记工，由群众当月还工。民校的经费，经决定由参加学习的学员共同负担，并订出了开支标准。
