Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th. The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League convened a symposium on the 26th and 27th, gathering student department heads of local Youth Leagues who were attending the Second Enlarged Session of the 14th Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation. At the meeting, experiences were widely exchanged on issues such as ideological remolding of students in newly liberated areas, carrying out New Democratic studies, and the work of the Youth League in schools. Representatives from the Youth League's general branches of Peking University and Tsinghua University also participated. On the 26th, representatives from Beijing, Northeast, Wuhan, Hebei, and other regions first reported on their experiences in carrying out student ideological remolding work. The representatives unanimously agreed that ideological remolding is about establishing a revolutionary worldview. In carrying out this work, attention should be paid to combining theory with practice and guiding students to think freely with leadership. The content of study should address one or two basic and major problems existing in the thinking of local students, based on specific circumstances. For example, Beijing used lectures on labor creating the world and the five modes of production to establish a labor perspective and class perspective; the Northeast and Wuhan used the study of current events and history to illustrate the essential differences between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, and then conducted education on the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism. Representatives from Wuhan and Tianjin introduced the experiences of the two cities in guiding students to transition to normal learning after liberation, explaining that after the high tide of the ideological remolding movement in the early days of liberation, the focus of work should be shifted to regular course learning in a timely and proactive manner. Subsequently, representatives from Tsinghua University and Nanjing introduced their experiences in carrying out rational streamlining and reforming the curriculum, pointing out that this is a long-term task that must be carried out by the education administrative authorities in a guided and step-by-step manner, with students only playing a supporting and assisting role. Representatives from various regions also introduced their experiences in improving teacher-student relations, studying political courses well, and how the Youth League in schools should carry out its work. On the second day of the symposium, Zhang Zonglin, Deputy Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, attended the meeting and reported on the situation and process of curriculum reform in North China. After Deputy Director Zhang's report, student department heads from various regions put forward the opinions of students from various regions on curriculum reform for the Ministry of Education's reference.

　　团中央召集各地团委学生部长座谈
    交流领导学习的经验
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会，二十六、二十七两日，召集列席中华全国学生联合会第十四届第二次执委会扩大会议的各地青年团委学生部长举行座谈会。会上就新区学生思想改造工作、开展新民主主义学习、学校青年团工作等问题，广泛地交流了经验。青年团北京、清华两大学总支委并派代表参加。二十六日，首由北京、东北、武汉、河北等地代表报告了他们进行学生思想改造工作的经验，代表们一致认为思想改造就是建立革命人生观的问题。在进行这一工作时，应注意理论与实际结合以及有领导地启发同学们自由思想。学习内容应根据具体情况解决当地学生思想中存在的一两个基本的和主要的问题。如北京通过讲授劳动创造世界、五种生产方式以建立劳动观点和阶级观点；东北、武汉则通过时事和历史的学习来说明共产党和国民党本质上的不同，然后再进行马列主义的基本观点的教育。武汉和天津的代表介绍了两地解放后领导同学转入正常学习的经验，说明了在解放初期经过思想改造运动高潮后，应及时地主动地将工作重心转向正课学习。继由清华大学和南京市的代表介绍进行合理精简和改革课程的经验，指出这是一件长期的工作，必须由教育行政当局有领导有步骤地进行，学生只能起着配合与助手的作用。关于搞好师生关系、学好政治课、学校青年团如何进行工作等问题，各地代表也分别介绍了他们的经验。在座谈会的第二天，中央人民政府教育部高等教育司张宗麟副司长到会报告了华北地区课程改革的情况和经过。张副司长报告后，各地学生部长提出了各地同学对课程改革的意见，以供教育部参考。
