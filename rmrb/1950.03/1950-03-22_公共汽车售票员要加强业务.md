Public Bus Conductors Need to Strengthen Their Skills

　　On the 16th of this month at 2:35 PM, I boarded a bus from the Market Station going to Xisi. The conductor overcharged one passenger by 100 yuan. Later, the passenger questioned him, and he then refunded the money. On the 17th, at 7:00 AM, I boarded a bus from Beigouyan Station going to Beihai. This conductor also overcharged four passengers. Although these amounts are small and the overcharging was not intentional, it reflects very poorly on the passengers and also shows that they are not proficient in their skills.

　　公共汽车售票员要加强业务
    本月十六日下午二时三十五分我由市场站上车去西四，售票员多收了一位乘客的一百元，后来乘客质问他才退还人家。十七日早七点我由北沟沿站上车去北海这位售票员同志也多收了四位乘客的钱。这数字虽然小，也不是故意多收，但在乘客的反映上是很不好的，同时也说明他们业务上是不够熟练的。
