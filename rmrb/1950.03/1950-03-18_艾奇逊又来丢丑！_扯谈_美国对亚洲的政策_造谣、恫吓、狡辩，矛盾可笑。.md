Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: US Secretary of State Acheson delivered a speech on March 15th to the California National Club in San Francisco, entitled "America's Policy Toward Asia." Acheson announced that the US policy toward Asia is to vigorously support the colonial puppet regimes of Quirino, Syngman Rhee, Hatta, Bao Dai, etc., in order to oppose the liberation movements of their own people and to oppose so-called "Soviet Communism." Acheson calls this US policy "helping free nations to determine their own destiny in their own way."

Acheson began his sophistry by feigning sympathy for Asian national independence movements. Acheson said: "We care for the people of Asia as people. We want to help them by treating them as people. We don't want to get anything from them for ourselves. We don't want to deprive them of any opportunity, any freedom, or any right. We do not want to use them to achieve any of our own purposes." He then said: "We must realize that a new era has fully unfolded in Asia, and that profound changes are taking place throughout this vast region, which includes more than half of the world's population. The significance of this change, and the reason why this change is irreversible, lies in the fact that it is caused by the profound and revolutionary movement of the Asian people. This movement, this powerful belief, is caused by two dominant ideas. One is the aversion to misfortune and poverty as normal living conditions. The second is the dislike of foreign rule. These ideas meet together and are integrated into a clear concept of national independence."

But Acheson then declared that the countries he referred to as having already "achieved national independence" were "the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, South Korea, and Indonesia." Acheson believes that Bao Dai is "moving along this same path, developing a new relationship with France," so the US government "welcomes this development and will continue to encourage it in the future as it has in the past." Therefore, Acheson quickly proved that what he called "national independence" is the continued maintenance of colonial status.

Acheson used lengthy passages to talk about China. Acheson admitted that the Kuomintang government lost the support of the people because it failed to meet the needs of the people and because of ignorance and blindness, but he tried his best to avoid mentioning the significant fact that the Kuomintang government was overthrown under the full support of the US government. Although Acheson admitted that when people judge the intentions of the US government, "actions always speak louder than words," he dared not mention how the US had frantically aided the Kuomintang government in attacking the Chinese people for a long time, and even now continues this sinful action.

Acheson could not hide his fury caused by the failure of his rumor-mongering and instigation when talking about the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between New China and the Soviet Union. Acheson compared the huge "aid" used by the United States to supply the Kuomintang civil war with the Soviet Union's 300 million loan, but dared not point out the fundamental opposition between the nature and purpose of the two. Acheson despicably used the increase in the ruble exchange rate to carry out new instigation, deliberately pretending not to know the common sense that China would not be affected when purchasing materials because of the corresponding reduction in Soviet prices. Acheson also despicably spread rumors that grain was shipped from China to the Soviet Union, causing famine in China, although people know that the Northeast only sells non-food beans to the Soviet Union, and the grain in the Northeast is continuously transported into Guannei.

Acheson issued very ridiculous threats about the natural and traditional connections between the Chinese people and the people of China's neighboring countries. The US Secretary of State revealed in his speech an arrogant formula: Southeast Asia - this is America's; everything that happens here - is America's business; Asians must maintain the colonial order of Quirino, Syngman Rhee, and Bao Dai, and whoever violates this is "hostile to American interests" and will "violate the Charter of the United Nations." Acheson thus exposed the true face of what he said, "We do not want to use them to achieve any of our own purposes."

Acheson did not answer: Why won't everything that happened in China be repeated in Southeast Asia?

But even Acheson himself could not give an optimistic outlook on the "America's Asia" in his mind. Acheson said: "Even in the best circumstances and with the constant help of their friends on other continents, these new Southeast Asian countries will face many difficulties and it will be difficult to stand on their own and make progress along the difficult road ahead of them. Therefore, this is really a tragedy." The only magic trick of the US Secretary of State is to advise these colonies of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands to rise up against their "main threat," "Soviet Communism," and as long as they do so, US aid may "take effect in Southeast Asia." Regarding the content of US aid, Acheson explained: "In some cases, US aid will be military assistance." However, Acheson admitted that this kind of aid is often ineffective, such as "The large-scale aid we gave to China failed to bring peace and economic recovery to the Chinese people as we had hoped, which is extremely disappointing." Why won't everything that happened in China be repeated in Southeast Asia? Regarding this, the spokesperson of the US government did not give any answer.

### 艾奇逊又来丢丑！  扯谈“美国对亚洲的政策”  造谣、恫吓、狡辩，矛盾可笑。

　　艾奇逊又来丢丑！
    扯谈“美国对亚洲的政策”
    造谣、恫吓、狡辩，矛盾可笑。
    【新华社十七日讯】美国国务卿艾奇逊十五日在旧金山加利福尼亚国民俱乐部发表题为《美国对亚洲的政策》的演说。艾奇逊宣布美国对亚洲的政策，就是竭力支持季里诺、李承晚、哈达、保大等殖民地傀儡的政权以反对本国人民的解放运动，并反对所谓“苏维埃共产主义”。艾奇逊把美国的这个政策，称为“协助自由民族依照他们自己的方式来决定自己的命运”。
    艾奇逊从伪装同情亚洲民族独立运动开始他的狡辩。艾奇逊说：“我们把亚洲人民当作人民来关怀。我们要把他们当作人民看待来帮助。我们不要为了我们本身从他们那里取得任何东西。我们不要使他们得不到任何机会，任何自由和任何权利。我们不要利用他们来达到我们自己的任何目的。”接着他又说：“我们必须了解到：一个新的时代已在亚洲全面展开了，而且这个包括有世界人口一半以上的整个广大地区正在发生深刻的变化。这种变化的意义，这种变化之不能挽回的理由，在于这种变化是亚洲人民深刻的和革命的运动造成的。这种运动，这种有力的信念是由两种支配的思想所造成的。一个就是厌恶作为正常生活条件的不幸与贫困。第二个就是嫌恶外国的统治。这些思想遇在一起，溶合在民族独立的明确概念中。”
    但是艾奇逊随即声明：他所指的已经“达到了民族独立”的国家，乃是“菲律宾、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、缅甸、南朝鲜和印度尼西亚”。艾奇逊认为保大“正循着这同一条路前进，与法国发展一种新的关系”，所以美国政府“欢迎这个发展，并在将来像过去一样地继续予以鼓励”。因此，艾奇逊迅速地证明了他所说的“民族独立”，就是继续保持殖民地状态。
    艾奇逊用冗长的篇幅讲到中国。艾奇逊承认国民党政府因为未能应合人民的需要以及愚昧和盲目而致丧失人民的支持，但是竭力避免说到国民党政府是在受美国政府全力支持的条件下被推翻的这一个显著的事实。艾奇逊虽然承认在人们判断美国政府的意向时，“行动总是较言论更为响亮”，但是他在涉及中国的时候，却不敢提到美国长期间如何疯狂地援助国民党政府进攻中国人民，而且直至现在还在继续着这种罪恶的行动。
    艾奇逊在说到新中国和苏联缔结了友好同盟互助条约的时候掩盖不住自己因造谣挑拨失败而产生的狂怒。艾奇逊拿美国用以供给国民党内战的浩大“援助”来与苏联的三亿贷款相比较，但是不敢指出两者的性质和用途的根本相反。艾奇逊卑鄙地利用卢布涨价来进行新的挑拨，而故意装作不知道因为苏联物价相应的减低所以中国在购买物资时不受影响的这样一项常识。艾奇逊又卑鄙地造谣说粮食从中国运到苏联造成了中国的饥荒，虽然人们都知道东北只卖给苏联以非供食用的豆类，而东北的粮食则源源运入了关内。
    艾奇逊关于中国人民和中国邻邦人民的天然的传统的联系发出非常可笑的恫吓。美国国务卿在自己的演说中流露一个狂妄的公式：东南亚洲——这是美国的；在这里发生的一切事情——都是美国的事情；亚洲人必须保持季里诺、李承晚、保大式的殖民地秩序，而谁如果违反这一点，谁就是“敌视美国的利益”，谁就将“违反联合国的宪章”。艾奇逊就这样拆穿了他所说的“我们不要利用他们来达到我们自己的任何目的”的真面目。
  艾奇逊没有作出答案：在中国发生的一切，为什么在东南亚不会
        重复发生呢？
    但是甚至艾奇逊自己也不能对他心目中的“美国的亚洲”给予乐观的展望，艾奇逊说：“甚至在最好的环境之下并有其他大陆的他们的友人的不断帮助，这些东南亚的新国家都会是困难重重，难以沿着他们面前的艰难道路自立起来而有所进步。因此，这真是个悲剧。”美国国务卿的唯一锦囊妙计就是劝告这些美国、英国、法国、荷兰的殖民地奋起反对他们的“主要威胁”“苏维埃共产主义”，而只要这样，美国的援助就可能“在东南亚生效”。关于美援的内容，艾奇逊解释道：“在某些情况之下，美援会是军事援助。”不过艾奇逊承认这种援助往往也是并不生效的，例如“我们给予中国的大规模援助未能像我们所希望的那样把和平与经济复兴带给中国人民，这是使人极为失望的”。在中国所发生的一切，为什么在东南亚不会重复发生呢？关于这一点，美国政府的发言人没有作出任何答案。
