Xinhua News Agency, London, March 24th: According to a Reuters report from London: The new British Labour government's Secretary of State for War, Strachey, in a report on the army budget submitted to the House of Commons on the 20th, stated that Britain would continue to strengthen the suppression of colonial peoples' liberation movements. However, it also revealed the deep concern of the British ruling group about the failure to oppose the Malayan people's liberation struggle. Strachey pointed out that the implementation of compulsory military service domestically was due to "overseas military missions not having decreased," admitting that Britain had "greatly increased the number of regular troops, but it is still absolutely not enough." He asserted that there would be "no possibility of reducing the army" before 1953. Strachey called the colonial war against the Malayan people the "most serious problem" and "arduous task" for Britain in the Far East, and also admitted that "military force alone is unlikely to achieve remarkable success."

    招认进攻马来亚失败
    【新华社二十四日讯】据路透社伦敦消息：英工党政府新任陆军大臣斯特拉彻二十日在下院提出的关于陆军预算的报告，说明英国将继续加强对殖民地人民解放运动的镇压，但同时也显露了英国统治集团对于反对马来亚人民解放斗争的失败，感到深刻的忧虑。斯特拉彻指出国内实施强迫兵役制，是由于“海外军事任务未曾减少”，承认英国已“大大增加了正规军人数，但还绝对不够”，他断言在一九五三年前“也还不会有减少军队的可能”。斯特拉彻把反对马来亚人民的殖民战争，称为英国在远东的“最严重的问题”和“艰巨的任务”，并且承认“单靠军队不见得会有惊人成功”。
