Newspaper Editorial Departments How to deal with letters from workers?
D. Byekasov

If letters pile up in the hands of employees, are lost, or fail to yield results, the editorial department shall bear full responsibility. There can be no objective reasons for editorial letters to be shelved. Everything lies in the organization of the work of handling letters. We cite the experience of *Truth* [Pravda] in receiving around 160,000 letters from readers in 1947. To more clearly express the impression of this number, it must be noted that provincial newspapers only receive 10,000 to 15,000 letters a year, and some newspapers receive even fewer. In the *Truth* [Pravda] office, there is no "resting place" for letters. An employee of the reader's letter group handles 35 to 40 letters per day. This number equals or even exceeds the number of letters received by other provincial newspapers in a day. Therefore, in provincial newspaper offices, this number of letters is not handled by one employee, but by a group of people, or more precisely, by all the staff of the editorial department. If the work of handling letters in the editorial department is still neglected, it means that the newspaper has not implemented management of every letter, and it means that the newspaper has not carried out systematic daily work of handling letters. The staff of such editorial departments, after receiving letters and reading them, if for some reason they cannot be published immediately, regardless of whether they should be resolved quickly or how to deal with the letters, they will be shelved in the current affairs file "temporarily." As time goes by, the letters are shelved and become obsolete day by day. The staff of such editorial departments focus all their attention on preparing the newspaper's own communications: hurriedly collecting materials, hastily writing cliché short essays, and using these things to fill the pages of the newspaper issue after issue. Such journalists forget one of the most important duties—to give the letters of workers the greatest outlet in the newspaper.

In order to successfully complete this task, the editorial department should stipulate what kind of letters to choose for publication, and what is the most appropriate way for each letter to be published in the newspaper. When selecting letters for printing, the director of the reader's letter group should determine with the editor of the newspaper what kind of social interests this letter represents and how important it is.

When reviewing mail, the editors of the newspaper and the staff of each group encounter many extremely diverse problems and facts every day. Therefore, in such a wide range of often conflicting materials, it is important to correctly select and correctly decide what should be supported in the newspaper. Here, it is also very important to be able to correctly distinguish and support facts and emotions that are sufficient to strengthen our social system, and to introduce the best examples representing the demeanor and character of Soviet people. In short, it is necessary to know what the newspaper should support at that time and what it should rise up against.

We attach importance to letters that represent significant social interests, but this does not mean that it is unreasonable to publish personal accusations from workers; on the contrary, the accusations of Soviet people precisely represent social interests. For example, *Truth* [Pravda] (July 26, 1947) published a letter from engineer Majiyev. He complained that since being demobilized from the army and returning to the factory, he had accepted the task of organizing a workshop. When he was carrying out his work, he had "friction" with the factory's chief engineer. As a result, engineer Majiyev was demoted. He complained to the ministry, but after a long time, he still did not receive a reply from the ministry.

In form, this is a personal accusation, but in essence, it has greater significance: it is a criticism of the intolerable methods in the factory and the bureaucracy in the ministry.

After studying the letters, selecting some of them for publication, and transferring them to appropriate groups, the work of finding a good way to publish them is also important. It should be noted that in the case of diverse letter content, the publication method must be different.

It is extremely important to make the letters published in the newspaper appear as "reader letters." Under this title, the essence of letters that do not have any connection with each other but touch on important issues are published. For example, in *Truth* [Pravda] (March 5, 1948), there was a summary of reader letters composed of the following letters: "City leaders do not pay attention to municipal facilities," "Forgotten radio broadcasts," "The edge of the 'Extra' newspaper is not sharp enough." The reader letter group regularly prepares this type of material extracted from three to five letters. Some newspapers, in addition to this, use several general headings such as "Essential Questions," "Short Appeals," "Editorial Mailbox," etc., to publish summaries of brief critical letters.

The summary of letters should not only include critical materials, but also positive materials, as done by *Moscow Bolshevik*. In the pages of this kind of newspaper, there are often letters that record this or that kind of positive fact. For example, in a communication under the title "Happy Journey," it detailed the cultural service for passengers on the electric train from Moscow to Laming Skoye; in a letter "They Have Returned to Work," it talked about the attention of Soviet society to the honorary soldiers of the Patriotic War.

However, if the newspaper is limited to this kind of selection, it will make its activists give up clarifying many issues, and also give up reporting on the economic and political movements that have become the focus of our newspapers. Therefore, the departments of the editorial department should widely use readers' letters and communications when selecting articles. As the experience of our newspaper shows, letters to the editorial department will help to raise serious issues in the work of industrial enterprises, collective farms, Soviets, economic, cultural and scientific institutions in the newspaper.

The *Moscow Bolshevik* newspaper editorial department's good use of readers' letters is a vivid example. The editorial department of the newspaper received a letter from a factory. The author of this letter was Comrade Drozdoff, a forger, who reported that a workshop's work plan was incorrect, which caused forced shutdowns, reduced production, and affected workers' wages. After checking the letter, the editorial department came to the conclusion that the letter was of great importance. The letter was published in the newspaper and then discussed in the factory. The factory leadership corrected the various shortcomings in the plan. However, the role of Comrade Drozdoff's letter was not limited to this. It also reminded the editorial department to check how the workshop plans of other factories were. The newspaper published an article on workshop plans, and then published an editorial on the same topic.

Readers' letters can be widely cited in various articles in all newspapers, such as essays, commentaries, sketches, and sharp short comments on a specific fact. On July 4, 1947, *Truth* [Pravda] published a short comment entitled "A Shameful Thing." The basis for this short comment was a reader's letter sent to the editorial department, which reported a particularly shameful fact. The leaders of a certain district in Rostov Province punished a district newspaper worker and sent him to court because he reported violators of the collective farm regulations. The *Truth* [Pravda] editorial department immediately assigned a special reporter to check the local facts. The special reporter flew to the district that day. The matter was confirmed. The next day, the special reporter's short comment was published in *Truth* [Pravda]. The review authorities immediately studied the case. The criminals were severely punished—removed from office and convicted (details have been published in the newspaper).

Of course, this is a special situation. But no matter how special it is, the combat mobility shown by the newspaper clearly shows how resolutely the Soviet organs of our country stop lawbreakers and protect the rights of citizens in accordance with the newspaper's call. Every honest Soviet person, after reading this communication and learning about the measures taken in response, will more firmly fight against any sabotage and abuse of national interests by anyone.

If the editorial department receives many meaningful letters on the same topic, it can use them for commentaries. For example, on May 11, 1948, *Truth* [Pravda] published a long commentary written by combining essays and letters sent to the editorial department, entitled "Valuable Soviet Rubles Should Be Used Reasonably!" Based on readers' suggestions, the newspaper solemnly raised the issue of eliminating redundant staff and abolishing parallel agencies. The newspaper emphasized in its conclusion: "The Soviet people have discovered the possibility of saving the country's money." The *Call* newspaper in Vladimir Province published a commentary on letters from young people on collective farms, entitled "Working Days of Rural Communist Youth League Members." The commentary began by talking about the huge creative labor that filled the working days of rural youth. To confirm this, interesting summaries of letters with the authors' names and addresses were cited. From these letters, we can know how actively the young people participated in the preparation for the completion of spring plowing.

*Volga Commune* published an interesting review of letters, entitled "Striving for the Reputation of Factory Trademarks."

*Chuman Truth* published a review of letters from loggers, entitled "In the Struggle to Practice Oaths." The content of this review is that the loggers clearly stated that they are striving to practice the oaths they made in the letter to Comrade Stalin.

Readers' letters to the editorial department often provide topics and practical materials for sketch writers. How sketch writers use readers' letters can be seen from the practice of *Truth* [Pravda]. The editorial department sent a letter from teacher Shukale to the Ukrainian Communist Party Provincial Committee in Zaporozhye Province about the difficulties of the Chervonoarmeysky District Committee not caring about teachers. Some time later, the letter returned to the editorial department with a statement from teacher and Communist Party member Shukale to the original letter, in which he... admitted his mistake, saying that his "action"—reporting to *Truth* [Pravda]—was anti-Party. The story of this statement is this: The Provincial Committee did not pay due attention to Comrade Shukale's letter, but only looked at it formally. The letter was then transferred to the District Committee. The District Committee also did not take measures on the facts stated in the letter, but began to strongly "rectify" the author of the letter, teaching him that his action of reporting to *Truth* [Pravda] was "wrong." As a result, Shukale wrote a statement admitting his mistake to the District Committee. Thus, this material became the subject of the sketch "Teacher Shukale's Mistake" written by sketch writers Zaslavsky and Bagojin.

This is another special event, but at the same time it is educational.

After narrating the "history" of this letter, the sketch writers pointed out at the end that neither the District Committee nor the Provincial Committee must study this mistake. They wrote: "We see from this incident not a mistake of Teacher Shukale, but a series of mistakes... We see that the mistake of the staff of the Zaporozhye Provincial Committee is that they have turned the Party organization of the province's leadership into the province's correspondence office.

"We see that the big mistake of the leaders of the Chervonoarmeysky District Committee is that they instilled non-Party views on the Soviet newspapers in the Communist Party members in the district. They judged that every Communist Party member's right to accuse his own newspaper, the organ of the Party Central Committee, and *Truth* [Pravda] was a 'fault'." (See *Truth* [Pravda], No. 184, July 18, 1947)

The experience of *Moscow Bolshevik* is noteworthy. Here, very different forms of publishing readers' letters are used, including sketches and cartoons attached to poems. For example, in a long summary of letters under the title "Reader's Letters," a cartoon was published entitled "They Work Like Clocks." A summary from a letter from a female teacher, as a satirical poem attached to this cartoon, her letter reported that she handed a watch over to a repair factory for repair. After eight months, she still could not get it back. The painting shows a factory sign with the advertisement "Can be picked up immediately," a watchmaker is pointing to the dial indicating the time, on which is written: "One year," "Several years." This cartoon is attached to a poem:

"Walking like a watch,
A customer runs to the factory for years,
They answer - it has not been repaired yet;
Now we understand:
The factory calculates time,
Is according to a special hour!"

In another summary of letters, a sketch entitled "Under One Roof" was published. It criticized the person in charge of one agency for hindering another nearby agency ("Under One Roof" - meaning in the same building). The newspaper often publishes sketches based on various topics suggested by workers' letters.

These are all effective ways to publish letters: they make the newspaper's pages come alive and make the newspaper interesting.

As the above examples illustrate, the editorial department can discover so many important and interesting things from the workers' letters it receives every day. The enrichment of newspaper topics, the diversification of genres, the overcoming of the stale methods of publishing materials - all these important issues cannot be resolved if the editorial department does not treat the work of handling readers' letters as the focus of attention of all staff.

After the letters are sent to each group and it is decided how to specifically use each letter, the letters should be revised. Many things depend on the editor. He can make the letter dry and tasteless, he can revise the letter in such a way that he removes everything from the letter except his signature. Of course, before they have learned to be cautious and treat letters from authors outside the editorial department with respect, it is best not to entrust such "editors" to revise letters.

The work of revising texts is a responsible task, especially when revising letters from workers. Many authors - workers, collective farm members, staff - are writing for the first time and do not yet have the necessary practical experience in handling the content of letters and expressing topics in words. Ordinary workers who decide to write to the newspaper for the first time do not think much about this. A fact excites him, so he decides to write to the newspaper to report this matter, so he hopes to get a certain result. As for the letter's textual structure, the author entrusts it all to the editorial department: "They can revise it however they want there, that is their specialty." In most cases, the author is far away, and the reviser cannot guide the author to further work on the letter, so the situation is even more complicated. Therefore, the text editor should handle the letter with special sympathy and care, understand the author's main idea, capture its tone, and then carefully revise the letter.

However, how do some other "revisers" work? Some take a package of letters and read them to the female typist one after another, while "correcting" - that is, replacing the vivid words in the letter with bland and old-fashioned terms; some write themselves, but rewrite the letter without paying much attention to the original text. These careless "revisers" simply forget the author of the letter, they only care about their own unique tastes.

Such revision "methods" push the author out of the editorial department, make the newspaper dry and tasteless, and cause a lot of trouble for the newspaper, because irresponsible revisers confuse and misrepresent facts, numbers, names...

However, correcting the text of the original manuscript does not mean that it must be rewritten. This is not necessary at all. The text editor who revises the letter should stand within the scope of the original letter. He can only replace those incomprehensible and inappropriate sentences and unsatisfactory terms with other more correct and appropriate sentences, cut out inappropriate words and structures in the sentences and structures, and strive to preserve the original face of the author's writing.

Kalinyn once said in a conversation with reporters: "Bourgeois newspapers win by sensationalism, but we do not sensationalize. Therefore, to make the letter interesting, we should retain the interesting content and make their style beautiful." (Kalinyn: "On Correspondents and Communications" Page 14, 1945 edition) When the editorial department pays attention to the political correctness of the material, it cannot ignore the beautiful style of the newspaper and the revision of the text of the published communications and essays. It is well known that if the style is mediocre and uninteresting, the newspaper loses half of its value.

In the process of revision, the actual content of the letter should be determined at the same time as the letter's textual structure. Does this mean that the editorial department must make a written inquiry for any letter? A simpler method of checking the facts reported should be found in each specific situation, so that a letter does not sit there for weeks and weeks: you can talk to the newspaper's correspondent working in the letter's area by phone, contact the editorial department of the district newspaper, and other methods.

Different letters do not all need to be reviewed in the same way. If a letter talks about some facts, and the author is very clear about the objectivity of these facts, then there is no need for tracing investigations; if this letter is a personal accusation, it should be investigated: either send someone to the local area, or ask the author to provide actual proof of what he is reporting. In all cases, the original author's name should be determined. Otherwise, there may be an accident: the newspaper publishes a letter, and the next day it receives a protest letter from the signer of the letter.

The vast majority of letters (about 90%) are confirmed to be correct in the investigation. However, the investigation work is still absolutely necessary. Local newspapers can investigate letters more easily than central newspapers, so they have more possibilities to publish workers' letters in their own newspapers.

However, these possibilities are sometimes not used in a considerable way. For example, a letter prepared for publication, entitled "When Will There Be a Catalog?" was sent to the secretariat of the "Soviet Latvia" newspaper. The author reported the chaotic situation of a library: at first, the library put books in a mess, and then placed them on shelves, but did not compile a catalog. In the secretariat, someone drew a question mark on the author's signature and a few words: "What are the first letters of the name and patronymic? What is the identity?" This letter was returned to the reader's letter group. There, someone added a sentence to it, which read: "Archive, no address in the letter." However, the library criticized in the letter was clearly very close to the editorial department, and it was easy to determine the content of the letter and know the author's address.

There are no such phenomena in places where attention is paid to handling letters. A letter saying that a children's nursery had no discipline was sent to the *Dawn of the East* newspaper (Tbilisi). Based on the clues in the letter, the editorial department sent a group of its own staff. This group of staff not only determined the content of the letter, but also discovered some new facts. The editorial department published the letter, with an addendum - the staff's notes.

The words in the Bolshevik newspapers are true. It affects people's consciousness, and through people's consciousness, it affects life itself. This is the nature of all the materials in our newspapers. However, some materials, that is, letters, notes, critical essays, in addition to this, also have the power to directly affect life. We say that the short comment on the "Shameful Incident", as we have already pointed out, is of educational significance; but in addition, since it was published in the newspaper, a most shameful thing has been corrected, and the autocratic criminal has been punished.

This characteristic of newspapers - the possibility of directly interfering in life and affecting life - forces the editorial department to actively seek the effects of all published and unpublished critical letters. Otherwise, the significance of these letters will be lost. In this way, both the reader and the letter writer can say: Why write letters to the newspaper if the shortcomings it reports are not eliminated?

Everything that the workers' letters point out must be eliminated. In the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the press, it was repeatedly emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely fight for the effect of workers' letters. This is one of the important ways to control the activities of Soviet organs, social organizations and economic organizations. With the help of this kind of control, we will be able to more quickly and resolutely eradicate the factors of bureaucracy and indifference to workers' inquiries that still exist in some places.

Naturally, the newspaper cannot publish all critical letters. However, things should be handled in such a way that no critical letter is left unanswered, and not only the author, but the whole society knows the measures that have been taken.

What is the best way to ensure the effect of the critical materials submitted to the editorial department?

We have already said that all critical letters should be placed under the special control of the editorial department, and not only the reader's letter group, but also other groups should pay strong attention to this, especially when talking about the published materials. The editorial department has great possibilities to make every letter achieve realistic results. When sending unpublished letters or the critical summaries of the current issue of the newspaper to the relevant organs, it must specify the deadline for the editorial department to wait for a reply. If the deadline is exceeded, you should remind them of this by letter or by phone. When an organ or a worker obviously despises the newspaper's call, the editorial department should think of ways to deal with them: ask the relevant Party committee for assistance, and expose them in the newspaper. In short, you must show tenacity.

The editorial department of *Soviet Siberia* adopted a good way to fight for the effect of letters. It publishes some critical letters and workers' complaints in the "True Record" column, and sends this column to the relevant organs to take measures. A brief report on the measures taken is published in the newspaper, entitled "The Response of 'True Record'." The following is one such report:

"In 1945, Glotova asked the factory committee of a factory to help repair her house. People refused her. She also went to ask the factory director.
Someone reported these facts to the editorial department. *Soviet Siberia*'s "True Record" sent a copy to that factory.
The enlarged meeting of the factory committee discussed the communication published in "True Record." They issued Comrade Glotova the necessary building materials for repairing the house. The factory's management department is responsible for helping her with labor."

It should also be noted that sometimes the editorial department receives not a reply to the letter, but an official article. Then, the author of this "reply" should be exposed, attempting to stifle criticism and overthrow criticism. In sketches, the most vivid official answers can be satirized sharply, just as *Truth* [Pravda] did with the letter of Teacher Shukale.

Here is another example. The *Communist* newspaper in Saratov received a "rebuttal" from Comrade Vlasov, chairman of the "October" District Soviet, to a statement from the residents of a certain courtyard. The statement said that the District Soviet Executive Committee had allowed food production to be carried out in the basement under the house, causing the residents to lose the place to store vegetables, and disturbing their peace and quiet (this house has 150 residents).

Instead of correcting the mistakes that have been tolerated, the chairman of the District Soviet cited the approval of the City Soviet, the architect, the health and fire inspections, and began to prove the correctness of this method.

The editorial department confirmed that all these "reasons" were fabricated by Comrade Vlasov himself, and severely criticized him.

Some newspapers do not often publish reports on the effects of their own statements. This creates the impression that people do not listen to the newspaper's calls, nor do they react. It is possible that there is really nothing to report to the editorial department, which means that the editorial department is not working well and has not strived for the effect of its own materials. Simple reports on the measures taken on the most important published and unpublished materials must be published in the daily newspaper, for example, as done by the *Culture and Life* newspaper. The Chigarov Provincial Newspaper publishes a long summary of the replies to the letters submitted for investigation, under the title: "The calls sent by the workers to the *Chigarov Commune* newspaper are handled in this way." The editorial department's struggle for the effect of workers' letters consolidates the newspaper's authority and strengthens its influence.

*Ural Worker* newspaper in Sverdlovsk Province publishes many workers' letters on various topics. These letters often involve various issues of workers' cultural and living facilities. The editorial department perseveringly strives for the specific results of each letter. Therefore, the heads of each enterprise and each agency immediately take measures on the letters without being reminded.

Comrade Bagryev, the editor of the newspaper, gave the following characteristic example when talking about editorial work:

"On March 2, we published a letter entitled "Care for Young Workers." The author of the letter reported that in the Sverdlovsk Hydropower Plant, the continued progress of cadres was not considered, the public dormitories were messy and desolate, young workers were not used according to their specialties, some workers were illegally demoted, and the factory rarely cared about the education of young workers. The Party organization and the Communist Youth League Committee immediately took measures to eliminate the above shortcomings. Thus, new furniture, sheets, buckets, kettles and other things appeared in the public dormitory."

The newspaper regularly reports the effects of published and unpublished letters.

The letters in the newspaper clearly express the needs and demands of the working masses. Therefore, the editorial department must systematically report to the organs in charge of the newspaper - the Party Committee - based on the letters.

A few more words about communicating with letter writers. Lenin once warmly advised us that we should care about how to receive letters not only for publication, but also for the editorial department to obtain information. "In addition, we require communication, that is, not for news reports, that is, not for publication, but for comradeship communication with the editorial department, to keep the editorial department informed, not only for the facts and events of the news, but also about the emotions, about the 'boring', ordinary, and habitual aspects of the movement on weekdays." (*Collection of Bolshevik Press*, Page 73, 1940 edition)

This communication should not be one-sided. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) required in its resolution on handling letters that the editorial department should not leave any letters sent to the newspaper unattended, and must notify them of the measures taken based on the letter writers' letters.

We have already said that the editorial department should send a copy of the reply from the competent authority investigating the facts reported in the letter to the letter writer. Moreover, before receiving this reply, the author must be notified that the editorial department has received the letter, and report where the letter has been transferred to and why it has been transferred.

Naturally, the communication between the editorial department and the author cannot be limited to this. Extensive and interesting communication should be carried out on the materials that are being prepared for publication and have already been published. Some newspaper staff members, when preparing to adopt letters from outside correspondents, do not want to attract them to participate in the work, even when there are no special difficulties to invite the author to the editorial department, contact them by phone, or write to them to solicit necessary supplements and explanations.

Communication with authors sometimes takes the form of empty answers. After shelving the letter for a month or even more, in order to relieve themselves of the responsibility for the letter, they write to the author in a tone similar to the following: "Your letter could not be published in time because the newspaper's official materials are very crowded, and now, the facts written in the letter are outdated. Please continue to send letters in the future." The *Commune Member* newspaper in Tula and the *Commune* newspaper in Voronezh gave such infuriating answers to letter writers. The purpose of this answer is not difficult to determine - it is simply to decline this kind of letter and author. When it begins to find out that the newspaper's official materials are "crowded," it turns out to be another matter: that is, the editorial staff fills the pages with their own materials, but does not study the workers' letters.

For example, the *Star* newspaper (Molotov City) wrote to the letter writer with the following content without any shame: "Dear Comrade! Your information is very interesting, but why did you only report the second shift, and not say anything about the first and third shifts? Please report some information about the technical night school when the exam is about to be held again. Best regards (signed)." Can the editorial department writing such a letter make the recipient write more letters?! Can it encourage him to seek and write new topics?!

Comrade Baltovsky, the head of the reader's letter group of the Binza District Newspaper, sent a more infuriating reply to an author. The reader Fu. Ye. Voyevodin wrote to the editorial department requesting answers to some theoretical questions. The editorial department should have replied with a letter, but in fact only sent the letter writer a piece of paper with the following content:

"Fu. Ye. Voyevodin: The newspaper is an organ whose task is to print newspapers, and through newspapers to spread the advanced experience of Stakhanovites in industry and agriculture; to convey important resolutions of the Party and the government to the general public, to expose the shortcomings in our economic construction, and so on. As for your questions, you have gone to the wrong place. If we want to answer these questions, we need to write a big book. We don't have time to do such work, and we also think it is unnecessary...

Baltovsky, Head of the Reader's Letter Group of the Editorial Department"

This bureaucratic reply was justly severely criticized by *Truth* [Pravda] (May 14, 1948).

What we need is that when newspaper staff and active letter writers and readers communicate, they should not use bureaucratic attitudes and official articles, but should better and deeper understand life, understand people's psychology, and help active members who are related to the newspaper to enrich each other.

*Volga Commune* newspaper (Kubishev City) showed a model of such thoughtful handling of workers' letters.

In addition to communicating with authors in their own names, the editorial department also systematically reports to readers on the number and nature of letters received in a day and the editorial department's handling of these letters in the "Our Mailbox" column in the newspaper. In fact, the editorial department reports to readers every day how it handles readers' letters.

The following are a few typical examples.

*Volga Commune* reported in the April 30 newspaper that it received 91 letters on April 29. These letters reported that each enterprise had completed the April plan ahead of schedule, reported the Stakhanovite work of leading workers, reported how state farms were preparing for planting, and so on.

The editorial department continued: "In the letters received yesterday, the editorial department received some complaints about the poor sanitary conditions of several courtyards and streets.

"Many letter writers complain that there are many shortcomings in the work of several Soviet and economic organs in the province.

"These letters have been distributed to the competent authorities for investigation and necessary measures. The editorial department is closely monitoring the progress of these measures."

In the May 5 newspaper, the editorial department notified readers that:

"Among the letters received yesterday, many were sent by readers who are engaged in vegetable growing. They are concerned about how to organize automobile transportation in private vegetable gardens. Bondarenko, Borodeni and other comrades suggested in their letters to expand the scope of automobile travel and change the end of the route from Revolution Square to the square near the Fourth Shari Kobo Deshshnipkov Factory. The editorial department has submitted this suggestion to the Municipal Soviet Executive Committee for review.

The editorial department received a total of sixty-eight letters yesterday."

Do this every day. After half a month, the editorial department reported to readers again:

"In the first half of May, the editorial department received a total of six hundred and thirty letters, short comments, communications and essays from readers and outside authors.

Among these documents, one hundred and ninety were published in *Volga Commune*. Among the letters sent to various organs for investigation and taking measures, two hundred and fifteen replies were received."

Kalinyn also clearly stated at the time that the communication between the editorial department and readers is of great significance. He wrote: "The relationship between the editorial department and the readers is probably not the relationship between the professor and his audience - but rather the newspaper is a large parliament, or a meeting that meets regularly. The people who participate in this meeting learn by themselves and also teach others to learn. The questions raised by the letter writer are not the questions raised by the student to his teacher. Sometimes the author of the letter implies his own readers - the editorial department - with his letter." (*Collection of Bolshevik Press*, Part 2, Page 138)

In Krupskaya's and Kalbinsky's memoirs about Lenin as an editor, it is clear that Lenin carefully handled manuscripts and paid close attention to the authors of letters to the editorial departments of each Bolshevik newspaper. This attitude towards authors, especially towards budding authors, is what we must learn. The workers of the Soviet press who serve the people's interests around the Communist Party must make their attitude like this.

★ ★ ★

The correct arrangement of the work of handling workers' letters by the newspaper editorial department is of great significance in principle. Workers' letters connect the newspaper with life and with the people. Only serious and prudent handling of workers' letters can enable the editorial department to timely recognize and correctly assess new phenomena in social life, and draw necessary conclusions for itself. Sometimes there are dozens of letters in the editorial department's archives explaining some new phenomena, but the editorial department has overlooked these new phenomena and has not pointed them out. This fact is well known. And if the editorial department cannot grasp the key points of these letters - then the reason why it cannot do so should be found in its formalistic attitude towards letters.

We require the Soviet newspaper to actually become a leading and guiding force. With this force, we focus the public attention of the society on the most important events and phenomena at present. To achieve this, the newspaper must maintain regular contact with its vast readership - the workers. It must carefully study the letters and use them correctly.

    倘若信件积压在职员们手中，遗失或未得结果，编辑部应负全部责任。不可能有任何客观的原因，使编辑部的信件搁起不动。一切事情在于处理信件工作的组织上。我们引用《真理》报在一九四七年收到十六万封左右读者来信的经验。为了更明显的表现出这一数目的印象，必须注意，各省报一年只收到一万封至一万五千封信，而某些报收信更少。在《真理》报社里，没有信件的“休息所”。读者来信组的一个职员每天处理三十五至四十封信。这个数目等于甚至超过别的省报一天所收到的信件的数目。所以，在省报社中，这个数目的信件，不是由一个职员处理，而是由一个组的人来处理的，更确切的说，是由编辑部全体人员处理的。倘若编辑部里处理信件工作仍有疏怠，就表示该报没有对每一封信实施管理，就表示该报对于处理信件的日常的有系统工作没有进行。这样的编辑部的职员，收到来信，读过之后，如果因为什么原故不能立即发表，便不管是否应当急速解决，如何对待信件，便“暂时”搁置在现行事务的纸夹中了。光阴荏苒，信件搁着，就一天一天过时了。这样的编辑部的职员，把全部注意集中在准备本报的通讯上：匆忙地搜集材料，仓促地写着老套的短论，就用这些东西一期一期的填塞报纸的篇幅。这样的新闻工作者们忘记了一项最重要的天职——在报纸上给劳动者的来信以最大的出路。
    为了顺利完成这个任务，编辑部应当规定，选择什么样的信件发表，对于其中的每一封信，用什么方式见报最适宜。当选择付印的信件时，读者来信组主任应与报馆编辑确定，这一封来信代表什么样的社会利益，它的重要性如何。
    报馆的编辑，各组的工作者，当审查邮件时，天天碰到许多极端纷歧的问题和事实。所以，在这样广泛的往往互相冲突的材料中，正确地选择与不错误地决定什么是应当在报纸的篇幅上加以赞助的，是很重要的事。在这里，能正确地辨别与赞助，足以加强我们社会制度的事实与情绪，介绍代表苏维埃人的风度和品德的最佳典型，也是很重要的事。总之必须知道，当时报纸应该赞助什么，以及应该奋起反对什么。
    我们对于代表着重大社会利益的信件给予重视，但是并不因为这个事实，就此认为发表劳动者们个人的控诉是不合理的，而且相反，苏维埃人的控诉恰恰是代表着社会利益的。比如《真理》报（一九四七年七月二十六日）便曾登载过工程师马吉耶夫的一封信。他诉说，自从由军队复员回到工厂以后，接受了组织一个车间的任务。当他执行工作时，同工厂里的总工程师发生了“摩擦”。结果，工程师马吉耶夫被降了级。他控诉到部里，但是经过很久的时间，仍没有从部里得到答复。
    在形式上，这是私人的控诉，而在实质上，就有较大的意义在：这是对于工厂里的不可容忍的办法以及部里的官僚主义作了批评。
    把来信研究过，选出其中一部分以便发表，并把它转交适当的各组，在这些工作以后，寻找见报的良好方式的工作，也不乏其重要性。应当注意：在信件内容纷杂的情况下，发表方式必须是有分别的。
    要使在报纸上发表的信件，恰如“读者来信”，这是极重要的事。在这个标题之下发表那些题目本身彼此没有联系却都触及重要问题的信件的精髓。例如，在《真理》报上（一九四八年三月五日）有一篇读者来信摘要是由这样一些信件组成的：“城市领导者不注意市政设施”，“被遗忘的无线电广播”，“‘号外’报的刀锋欠犀利”。读者来信组经常准备着这一类由三、五封信摘出的材料。有些报纸，除此之外，用几个总标题如“本质问题”，“简短呼吁”，“编辑信箱”等等，发表着简短的批评性信件的摘要。
    在来信摘要上，不仅应当包括批评性的材料，而且要包括积极性的材料，如《莫斯科布尔什维克》报所作的。在这一种报纸的篇幅上，常有这样信件，其中记载着这一种或那一种积极性的事实。例如，在一个“快乐的旅行”的标题下的通信中，详细说了从莫斯科到拉岷斯考耶的电气列车对于乘客们的文化服务的情形；在一件“他们已回来工作”的来信中，谈着苏维埃社会对于卫国战争的荣誉军人的注意。
    然而，报纸上如果仅限于这一类的选录，它就使自己的积极分子放弃了阐明许多问题，而且也放弃了报道那些成为我们报刊注意中心的经济政治运动。因此，编辑部的各部门，在选稿时，应当广泛利用读者来信和通讯。正如我们的报纸的经验所表明，给编辑部的来信将帮助在报纸上提出工业企业、集体农场、苏维埃、经济、文化与科学机关工作上的严重问题。
    《莫斯科布尔什维克》报编辑部之善于利用读者来信，是一个鲜明的例子。该报编辑部接到了一个工厂寄来的一封信。这封信的作者是锻工德洛兹多夫同志，他报告一个车间工作计划不正确，因此引起了被迫停工，生产降低，并影响到工人们的工资。检查这信以后，编辑部得到一个结论：这封信关系重大。这封信在报纸上发表了，而且接着又在工厂里讨论了。工厂指导部便纠正了计划中的各种缺点。但是，德洛兹多夫同志来信的作用不仅以此为限。它还提醒编辑部去检查其他工厂的车间计划如何。该报发表了一篇关于车间计划的论文，然后又发表了一篇同一题目的社论。
    读者来信可以广泛地引用于一切报纸的各种文章中，如论文、述评、小品、对于一种具体事实的锐利的短评。一九四七年七月四日的《真理》报，曾经发表过一篇短评，题为《可耻的事》。作为这个短评的根据的，就是一封投到编辑部的读者来信，其中报告了一件特殊的确乎可耻的事实。罗斯托夫省某一区的领导者们惩罚了一个区报工作者，他们把他送上了法院，因为他举发了集体农场法规的违犯者。《真理》报编辑部立即给以特派记者检查当地事实的任务。这位特派记者当天即飞往该区。事情证实。第二天，特派记者的短评便在《真理》报上发表出来了。各审查机关立刻研究了这一案件。犯罪者受到了严厉的惩罚——免除职务，并被判罪（详情已在报纸上发表过）。
    当然，这是一种特殊情形。但是，无论它怎么特殊，报纸所表现的战斗的机动性，非常明显地表示出，我们国家的苏维埃机关，按照报纸的呼吁，如何坚决地制止违法者与保障公民的权利。每一个正直的苏维埃人，读过这篇通讯以及得知对此所采取的措施以后，将更坚定地进行反对任何人对于国家利益的任何破坏与滥用的斗争。
    如果编辑部收到关于同一题目的许多有意义的信件，就可以利用它们作述评。例如，一九四八年五月十一日《真理》报发表过一篇综合寄到编辑部的论文与信件而写的长篇述评，题为《应该合理使用有价值的苏维埃的卢布！》根据读者的提示，报纸郑重提出了关于淘汰冗员的问题，关于裁撤骈枝机关的问题。该报在结论中强调：“苏维埃人发现了节省国家钱财的可能性。”弗拉基米尔省“号召”报登载了一篇集体农庄青年们的信件的述评，题为《农村共产主义青年团员们的工作日》。述评一开头就谈到充满农村青年工作日的巨大的创造劳动。为了证实这件事，引用了注明作者姓名住址的来信的有趣的摘要。由这些信件可以知道，青年们如何活跃地参加了完成春耕的准备工作。
    《伏尔加公社》报曾登载过一篇有趣的来信述评，题为《争取工厂商标的名誉》。
    《丘曼真理》报发表过一篇伐木工人的来信述评，题为《在为实践誓言的斗争中》。这篇述评的内容是伐木工人明白表示他们正努力实践在给斯大林同志的信中所提出的誓言。
    给编辑部的读者来信往往给小品作家提示题目，并供给他们实际的材料。小品作家怎样利用读者来信，这可以从《真理》报的实践中看到。编辑部把教师舒卡乐的一封关于柴尔伏诺亚尔美区委会不关心教师的困难的信送到扎波罗什省乌克兰共产党省委会去调查。过了一些时候，这封信回到编辑部，并附着教师共产党员舒卡乐对原信的一个声明，他在声明中……承认自己的错误，说他的“行动”——报告《真理》报——是反党的。这个声明的故事是这样的：省委会对舒卡乐同志的信没有给予应有的注意，只是形式地看过。这封信便被转到了区委会。区委会也不对这封信所说的事实采取办法，而开始强烈地“整”这封信的作者，教训他，说他报告给《真理》报，这行动是“错误”的。结果，舒卡乐给区委会写了一篇承认错误的声明。于是，这个材料成了小品作家扎斯拉夫斯基与包果金写小品“教师舒卡乐的错误”的题材。
    这又是一个特殊事件，但同时又是有教育意义的。
    小品作者们叙述了这封信的“历史”以后，在结尾指出，不论区委会或省委会，都必须研究这个错误。他们写道：“我们从这个事件中看到不是舒卡乐教师的一个错误，而是一连串错误……我们看到扎波罗什省委会工作人员的错误就是在于他们把省的领导的党组织，变成了省的通信处。
    “我们看到柴尔伏诺亚尔美区委会领导者们的大错就是在于他们对本区的共产党员灌输对苏维埃报纸的非党的见解，他们判定每一个共产党员向自己的报纸、向党中央委员会的机关报、向《真理》报控诉的权利是一种‘过失’。”（见一九四七年七月十八日《真理》报一八四号）
    “莫斯科布尔什维克”报的经验是值得注意的。这里利用了大不相同的发表读者来信的形式，其中有小品，有附着诗的漫画。例如，在一个“读者来信”的标题下的长篇来信摘要中，发表了一幅漫画，题为“他们像钟表似的工作着”。由一个女教师的信件中的摘要，作为附在这幅漫画的讽刺诗，她的信是报告她将一只表交给修理工厂去修理，经过了八个月，还不能取回来。这张画上画着带有“立刻可取”的广告的工厂招牌，一个钟表匠指着那表示时间数目的表盘，表盘上注着：“一年”，“几年”。这幅漫画附诗一首：
    “像表一样走着，
    一个顾客成年跑工厂，
    他们回答——还未修成；
    现在我们才明白：
    工厂里计算时间，
    是按照特别的钟点！”
    在另外一次来信摘要中，发表了一篇以《在一座屋顶下》为题的小品。其中批评一个机关的主管人妨碍另一个附近的（“在一座屋顶之下”——意即在同一所建筑中）的机关。该报常常发表一些取材于劳动者来信所暗示的各种题材的小品。
    这都是发表信件的有效果的方式：它们使报纸的篇幅呈现出生气，使报纸富于趣味。
    如上所引的这些例子说明，编辑部从每天收到的劳动者的来信中，能够发掘出那么多重要的有趣的东西。报纸题材的丰富化，体裁的多样化，发表材料的陈腐方式的克服——所有这些重要问题，编辑部如不把处理读者来信的工作当作全体人员注意的中心，就不能解决。
    当信件送到各组和决定怎样具体地利用每一封信以后，就要对信件作文字的修饰。有许多事有赖于文字的校正者。他能够使信件干燥无味，他能这样删改信件，对来信删得除去他的签字以外，其余一字不留。当然，当他们还没有学会谨慎地，并以尊重的心情对待编辑部以外的作者的来信以前，最好不要委托这样的“校正者”去修改信件。
    文字的修饰工作本是一件责任重大的事，尤其是修改劳动者的来信。有许多作者——工人们，集体农庄庄员们，职员们——初次执笔，还没有处理书信内容和用文字来表现题材的必需的实际经验。普通初次决意给报纸去信的劳动者不大想到这回事。一个事实激动了他，他于是决定给报纸去信报告这件事，因此希望得到一定的结果。至于信件的文字的结构，作者则全部托给编辑部了：“到那里，他们要怎么修改，就怎么修改好了，那是他们的专长。”大多数情形是这样，作者距离很远，改稿者不能引导作者对信件作进一步的工作，因此情形就更复杂了。所以，文字校阅者应当以特别的同情与关切来处理信件，了解作者的主要意思，捕捉它的语调，然后细心地修改信件。
    但是，另一些“改稿者”是在怎样地工作着呢？有的拿了一包信件，接二连三地念给女打字员听，同时进行着“修正”——即是把信中生动的词句换成平淡的陈旧的用语；有的自己来写，但是把信件重新改写，而不大注意原文。这些粗枝大叶的“改稿者”简直忘掉了信件的作者，他们只是顾到自己特有的口味。
    诸如此类的改稿“方法”把作者推出了编辑部，使报纸干燥无味，并给报馆增加许多麻烦，因为不负责任的改稿者混乱和误传了事实、数字、姓名………。
    但是对原稿作文字的校正完全不是意味着必须重新写作。这是没有任何必要的。修改信件的文字校阅者应当站在信件原稿的范围里。他只能把那些不通的、不恰当的句法及辞不达意的用语换成其他比较正确的与合适的文句，削去词句与结构中的不妥字眼，并力求保存作者文字的本来面目。
    加里宁有一回同记者们谈话时说：“资产阶级的报纸以耸人听闻取胜，而我们则不耸人听闻，因此，要使来信有趣，应当保留其中有趣的内容并使它们的文体优美。”（加里宁：“论通讯员与通讯”第十四页，一九四五年版）编辑部注意材料在政治上的正确性的时候，也不能忽视报纸的优美的文体，所发表的通讯、论文的文字的修饰。众所周知，如果文体平凡无趣，报纸便丧失了本身价值的一半。
    在改稿过程中，与信件的文字结构同时，应当确定它实际的内容。这是不是说编辑部一定要对任何一封信都作书面的询问呢？应当在每种具体情形下找到检查所报告的事实的比较简单的方法，为了一封信不致几星期几星期的搁在那里：可以与在来信地区工作的本报通讯员用电话谈话，同该区报纸的编辑部联络，以及其他方法。
    不同的信件并不是同样都需要审查的。如果有一封信谈到一些事实，而作者对于这些事实的客观性十分明白，就不需要追本溯源的调查；如果这封信是私人的控诉，就应当加以调查：或派人到当地去，或要求作者提供他所报告的实际的证明。在一切情形下，应当确实辨明原作者的名字。不然，就可能要发生这样的事故：报纸发表一封信，而在另一天收到这封信的签名者的抗议信。
    绝大多数的来信（大约有百分之九十）在调查中是证实无误的。但是，调查工作还是完全必要的。地方报纸调查信件比中央报纸容易，因而它们有更多的可能在自己报纸上发表劳动者的来信。
    然而，这些可能性有时并未以相当的方式加以利用。比如，有一封预备发表的信，题为“什么时候才有目录呢？”寄到了“苏维埃拉特维亚”报的秘书处。作者报告了一个图书馆的杂乱无章情形：起初该馆将书籍乱七糟八的搁着，后来分置在书架上，但没有编制目录。在秘书处里，有人对作者的签名画了一个问号和几个字：“名字和父名的第一个字母呢？身分呢？”这封信就被退回了读者来信组。在那里，有人又把它批了一句，批的是：“归档，信中无地址”。但是，信中所批评的这个图书馆明明距离编辑部很近，很容易便可以确定来信内容及确知作者的地址。
    凡是对信件注意处理的地方，便没有这样的现象。有一封说到一个儿童保育院无纪律的信送到《东方黎明》报（特比利斯）。编辑部根据来信的线索派出了一批本报的干员。这一批干员不只确定了来信的内容，而且又发现一些新的事实。编辑部发表了这封信，并附以补遗——干员们的笔记。
    布尔什维克报纸上的话是真实的。它影响到人们的意识，而通过人们的意识，影响到生活本身。这是我们的报纸的一切材料所具有的本性。但是，有一些材料，这就是信件，笔记，批评性的论文，除此以外，还具有直接影响到生活的力量。我们说，就是那篇“可耻的事件”的短评，如我们已经指出过的，有教育的意义；但是此外，自从在报上发表后，一件最可耻的事被纠正了，专横的罪人受到了惩罚。
    报纸的这一特性——直接干涉生活及影响生活的可能性迫使编辑部积极地去求得一切公布的和未公布的批评信件的效果。不然，这些信件的意义就要丧失。这样，不论读者或来信者就都可以说：干吗写信给报纸呢，倘若它所报道的那些缺点并没有被消除的话？
    对于劳动者来信所指出的一切缺点，必需设法消除。在联共（布）中央委员会关于报刊的决议中，曾屡次强调必须为争取劳动者来信的效果而坚决斗争。这是与论管制苏维埃机关、社会团体和经济组织活动的重要方式之一。用这种管制的帮助，我们便能够更迅速、更坚决地根除仍然存在于某些地方的对于劳动者的询问所抱的官僚主义和漠不关心的因素。
    自然，报纸不能公布一切批评的信件。但是，事情应当这样处理：要使任何一封批评的信件都不致没有下文，并且要不只使作者一人，而是全社会知道已经采取的措施。
    怎样用最好的方法保证交到编辑部来的批评材料的效果呢？
    我们已经说过，一切批评的信件都应当放在编辑部的特别管制之下，而且不仅一个读者来信组，就是其他各组也都应当对此予以强烈的注意，尤其是谈到关于所发表的材料的时候。编辑部握有极大的可能性使每一封信都获得现实的结果。当把未发表的信件或目前一期报纸的批评摘要送给有关的机关时，必须指定编辑部等待答复的期限。倘若超过期限，应当用信、用电话去提醒这件事。遇到某一机关，某一工作者显然轻视报纸的呼吁时，编辑部应当想出对付他们的办法：请求有关的党委协助，在报上揭露出来。总而言之，必须表现顽强性。
    “苏维埃西伯利亚”报编辑部采用了很好的斗争方式来争取信件的效果。它在“真情实录”专栏里发表一些批评信件和劳动者的怨诉，并把这一栏送交有关机关请其采取办法。关于所采办法的简单报道发表在报纸上，题为“‘真情实录’的反响”。下面就是这种报道的一则：
    “一九四五年，格洛托娃曾请求一家工厂的工厂委员会帮助修理房屋。人们拒绝了她。她也曾经去请求过厂长。
    有人把这些事实报告了编辑部。《苏维埃西伯利亚》报的“真情实录”送了一份给那个工厂。
    工厂委员会的扩大会议上讨论了发表在“真情实录”上的通讯。他们发给了格洛托娃同志修理房屋的必要建筑材料。工厂的管理部负责以劳力去帮助她。”
    还应当注意到那样一种情形：有时候编辑部收到的不是对于信件的答复，而是一种官样文章。那末，就应当揭露这种“答复”的作者，企图钳制批评，推翻批评。在小品文中，可以辛辣地讽刺最最鲜明的官腔答复，正如《真理报》关于教师舒卡乐的信所作的那样。
    还有一个例子。沙拉特夫《共产主义者》报收到了一封“十月”区苏维埃主席伏拉索夫同志对某一院住户们的声明的“驳正”。声明里说到，该区苏维埃执行委员会准许在住屋下面的地下室里从事食品生产，使住户们失去保存蔬菜的地方，并且扰乱他们的清静与安宁（这房子有一百五十个住户）。
    该区苏维埃主席不去改正已被纵容的错误，反而引证城市苏维埃的批准、建筑师、卫生与防火检查的许可证，开始证明这个办法的正确性。
    编辑部证实了这一切“理由”全是伏拉索夫同志自己杜撰出来的，就对他实行了严厉的批评。
    有些报纸不常发表关于自己言论效果的报道。于是造成这样一个印象：人们不听从报纸的呼吁，也不作反响。可能也有真正没有什么可以报告读者的编辑部，这就表示编辑部工作不好，没有争取本身材料的效果。必须在每天的报纸上登出对最重要的发表过的和没有发表的材料所采办法的简单报道，例如像《文化与生活》报所作的。乞加洛夫省报发表交付调查的信件的答复的长篇摘要，标题是：“劳动者送到‘乞加洛夫公社’报的呼吁是这样办理的”。编辑部为劳动者信件的效果所作的斗争巩固报纸的权威，加强它的影响。
    斯维德洛夫省《乌拉尔工人》报发表很多各种题目的劳动者的来信。在这些信件里，常常涉及劳动者的文化和生活设施的各种问题。编辑部百折不挠地争取每一封信的具体结果。所以，各企业与各机关的主管人员已经不待提醒，立刻就会对信件采取办法。
    该报编辑巴格列叶夫同志，在讲述编辑工作的时候，举出这样一个有特征的例子：
    “三月二日我们发表了一封以《要关心青年工人》为题的来信。来信作者报告说，在斯维德洛夫斯克水力电机工厂里，不考虑干部的继续进步，公共宿舍零乱荒芜，青年工人不依专长来使用，对于某些工人还非法降低等级，工厂里很少关心青年工人的教育。党组织和共产主义青年团的委员会就立刻设法消除上述缺点。于是公共宿舍里便出现了新的家具、被单、水桶、开水壶以及其他等等。”
    该报经常报告已发表的和没有发表的信件的效果。
    报纸上的来信，明白地表现着劳动群众的需要和要求。因此编辑部必须根据来信，有系统地为主管该报的机关——党委员会作成报告。
    关于和来信者通信，还要申述几句。列宁曾经热烈的劝告过我们，应该关心怎样收到不只是为了发表，并且也为了编辑部获得情报的信件。“此外，我们要求为了通信，就是并非为了消息报导，即是并非为了发表，而是为了和编辑部作同志性的沟通，为了使编辑部消息灵通，不仅对于事实事变的消息灵通，并且关于情绪，关于运动之平日的‘乏味的’、普通的、惯常的方面也要消息灵通。”（《布尔什维克报刊》文集，第七三页，一九四○年版）
    这种通信，不应该是单方面的。联共（布）中央委员会在其所作关于处理来信的决议中，要求编辑部对于投到报馆的信，一封也不要不加注意，并须把根据来信者的信件而采取的办法通知他们。
    我们已经说过，编辑部收到主管机关调查信内所报事实之后的复信，要寄一份抄件给来信者。而且在尚未接获此项复信之前，也必须通知作者，说编辑部已经收到来信，并报告已将来信转往何处，为什么转去。
    自然，编辑部和作者之间的通信不能只限于这一点。对于准备发表和已经发表的材料，应该进行广泛的和有趣味的通信。有些报纸工作人员，准备采用社外来信者的信件的时候，并不想吸引他们参加工作，甚至于在并无特别困难即可约请作者到编辑部来，用电话和他们联系，或者写信向他们征询必要的补充和解释的时候。
    和作者通信，有时形成徒具形式的空洞答复。把来信搁置了一个月甚或更多的时间，后来为了解脱自己对于来信的责任，便用类似下列的口气写信给作者说：“你的来信未能及时登出，是因为报纸的正式材料非常拥挤，而现在，来信所写的事实又已过时了。以后仍请继续来信”。图拉的《公社员》报和沃罗涅什的《公社》报两报社，便曾给来信者作过这种使人气愤的答复。这种答复的目的，不难断定——简直是要谢绝这种来信和作者。当开始查明报纸正式材料“拥挤”的时候，原来是另外一回事：即编辑部工作人员用自己的材料塞满了篇幅，对于劳动者的来信则并未加以研究。
    例如，《星》报（莫洛托夫城）即曾毫无愧色的以下述内容给来信者写信说：“敬爱的同志！你的情报很有意思，但是你为什么仅报告第二班，而丝毫不说第一班和第三班呢？请报导一些关于技术夜校的情形，在将要再举行考试的时候。此致敬礼（签字）”。编辑部写出这样的信，能够使收信人多写信来吗？！能够鼓励他寻觅并写作新的题材吗？！
    品匝区报纸读者来信组组长鲍尔托夫斯基同志，曾以更令人愤懑不快的回信寄给一位作者。读者夫·叶·沃也沃金曾写信给编辑部要求答复一些理论上的问题。编辑部应该复一封信，但事实上却只给来信人送去一张如下内容的纸条：
    “夫·叶·沃也沃金：报馆是这样一个机关，它的任务是印发报纸，并通过报纸以传布工业和农业上的斯塔汉诺夫运动者的先进经验；把党和政府的重要决议，传达给一般公民，揭发我们经济建设上的缺点，以及其他等等。至于你的问题，是走错门路了。我们如果要答复这些问题，需要写成一大本书。作这样的工作，我们没有时间，同时也认为不必要……。
    编辑部读者来信组组长鲍尔托夫斯基启”
    这个官僚主义的答复，很公道地受到了《真理》报的严厉批评（一九四八年五月十四日）。
    我们所需要的，是报纸工作人员和积极来信者及读者通信时，不要用官僚态度和官样文章，而是要更好的更深的了解生活，了解人们的心理，并帮助与报纸有关的积极分子，彼此间互相充实起来。
    这样深思远虑的处理劳动者的来信，《伏尔加公社》报（古比雪夫城）便表现过模范。
    该报编辑部除了用私人名义和作者通信以外，并在报纸上有系统的逐日的在“我们的信箱”一栏向读者报告一天之中所收到的信件的数目及其性质，并报告编辑部对这些信件处理的情形。实际上便是编辑部天天向读者报告它对读者的信件是如何处理的。
    下面便是几个典型的实例。
    《伏尔加公社》报在四月三十日的报纸上，报告在四月二十九日收到了九十一封信。这些信件报告各企业提前完成了四月份的计划，报告带头工人的斯塔汉诺夫式的工作，报告国营农场如何准备播种，以及其他等等。
    编辑部继续说：“在昨天收到的信件中，编辑部接到了一些控诉，是诉说若干庭院和街道的卫生情形不好的。
    “很多信件的作者，控诉本省若干苏维埃机关和经济机关的工作存在着很多缺点。
    “这些信件已经分交各主管机关，以便加以调查并采取必要的办法。而这些办法的进行情况，编辑部正在密切注视着”。
    在五月五日的报纸上，编辑部通知读者说：
    “昨天收到的信件中，有不少是从事种菜工作的读者们寄来的。他们关心着在私人菜园区将如何组织汽车运输。邦达林柯和鲍罗德尼及其他同志，在其来信中建议扩大汽车的行驶范围，把路线终点从革命广场改到第四沙里柯波德什普尼可夫厂附近的广场。他们这一建议，编辑部已经提交市苏维埃执行委员会审查。
    昨天编辑部总共收到六十八封信”。
    逐日这样作下去。经过了半个月。编辑部又向读者报告说：
    “在五月的前半月中，编辑部收到读者和社外作者寄来的信件、短评、通讯和论文总共六百三十件。
    在这些文件中，在《伏尔加公社》报上发表过的是一百九十件。另有寄交各机关从事调查和采取办法的信件中，得到了二百一十五件答复。”
    加里宁在当时也曾经明确的说明编辑部和读者之间的通信，是具有重要意义的。他写道：“编辑部和读者的关系，大概不是教授和自己听众的关系——毋宁说报纸是一个大型的议会，或者是经常开会的会议，参加这个会议的人们，自己学习着，同时也教导着别人学习。来信者所提出的问题，不是学生向自己教师提出的问题，有时来信的作者是用自己的信暗示自己的读者——编辑部的”。（《布尔什维克报刊》汇编，第二部，一三八页）
    在克鲁普斯卡亚及卡尔宾斯基的关于作为编辑的列宁的回忆录中，明白地指出列宁是如何小心翼翼地处理手搞的，他对于和各布尔什维克报纸编辑部的来信的作者们是予以何等深切的注意的。对于作者，尤其是对于初出茅庐的作者，抱持这样的态度，是我们所必须学习的。环绕在共产党周围为人民利益而服务的苏维埃报刊的工作者们，必须把自己的态度作到这样。
    ★  ★  ★
    报纸编辑部对于处理劳动者来信的工作加以正确的安排，是具有原则上的重大意义的。劳动者的来信，使报纸和生活、和人民联系起来。只有认真的和审慎的处理劳动者的来信，才能使编辑部及时认识和正确评估社会生活中的新现象，并为自己作出必要的结论。有时编辑部档案中积存着几十封说明某些新现象的信，而编辑部对于这些新现象却忽略过去，没有指出来，这种事实是众所周知的。并且，如果编辑部不会捉摸这些信件的要点，——那么，它所以不会的原因，便应当在它对于信件所持只重形式的态度中去寻找。
    我们要求苏维埃报纸事实上成为一个领导和指引的力量，用这个力量，使社会上公众的注意力集中到目前最重要的事件和现象上去。要想作到这种地步，报纸便必须和自己的广大的读者群众——劳动者保持经常的来往，必须细心的研究来信，并加以正确的利用。
