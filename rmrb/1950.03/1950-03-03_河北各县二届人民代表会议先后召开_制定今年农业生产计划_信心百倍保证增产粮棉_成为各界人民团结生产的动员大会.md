[Special Dispatch from Baoding by This Newspaper] The People's Governments of various counties in Hebei Province are deploying spring plowing and production through the second session of the People's Representative Conference. Over eighty counties in the special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, Baoding, Tongxian, and Dingxian had convened before the Spring Festival, with a total of nearly 20,000 representatives attending. The People's Representative Conferences of various counties, in order to implement the goal of restoring agricultural production in general areas to pre-war levels this year, have formulated agricultural production plans for 1950, and decided on specific measures to achieve increased production tasks. The representatives are full of confidence in realizing the increased production plans. After serious discussions, the increased production plans of most counties in the Handan and Xingtai special districts exceeded the increased production requirements of the province and special districts for each county by 10 to 30 percent. At the meetings, government representatives explained various production policies in detail to the representatives from all walks of life. After repeated discussions by the representatives to clarify their thinking, representatives from all social strata fully agreed with and enthusiastically supported the Communist Party and the People's Government's policy of uniting to develop production and become prosperous, and firmly expressed their determination to work hard to launch a large-scale production movement.

Among the representatives of each county, production activists, production models, and labor heroes, accounting for about one-quarter to one-sixth of the total number of representatives, were elected as representatives. They became the best teachers in the discussions at the meetings. Before the meetings, the counties in the Handan, Xingtai, and Cangxian special districts sent working groups to investigate the increased production conditions of different villages and formulate draft increased production plans for the entire county, making the discussions at the meetings more practical.

	Meetings Spend Two-Thirds of the Time Discussing Specific Production Issues, Dispelling Concerns, and Enhancing Confidence

In terms of time allocation, the meetings in various counties generally used only one-third or even less of the time to review last year's production work and report on the draft increased production plan for 1950; two-thirds or even more of the time was spent on small group discussions, special issue seminars such as well-digging, cotton planting, and organizing mutual aid, and listening to typical reports from labor heroes and models. The general situation of the meetings was: at the beginning, the representatives were very interested in the increased production plan, but some people were worried that "increased production would inevitably increase the burden;" and were concerned that they would soon be eating from the "big pot," holding a "production without thrift" attitude. At the same time, some representatives of government cadres underestimated the enthusiasm of farmers for production and their desire to become prosperous, exaggerating some of the farmers' concerns and the difficulties of increasing production. In response to this situation, government representatives explained in detail the policies of rewarding production, burdens, agricultural loans, free lending, and guaranteeing land rights and financial rights. Labor heroes and models gave reports at the meetings, telling everyone about the facts of various production and prosperity cases, such as Nanxiaotun Village in Cheng'an County selling cattle to exchange for sixty mules, and Dongzhenchi Village in Handan County now having eighty-eight livestock, an increase of fifty compared to before the war. In addition, the profits from last year's increased production in model production villages were used to enlighten everyone to carefully plan and calculate. The representatives' concerns quickly disappeared, and their confidence was enhanced. They envied the glory of the labor heroes and models. Thirty-four representatives from middle-peasant families in Jiaohe County said one after another: "The door to production and prosperity has been opened."

	Careful Calculation and Enthusiastic Discussion; Formulating Specific Increased Production Plans; Concentrating Experience to Solve Difficulties

After understanding the policies, the representatives felt confident and enthusiastically discussed the increased production plans. For example, representatives from Guangzong County proposed to apply half a cart of manure more to produce fifteen more catties of grain; and good maintenance of cotton could yield ten more catties of cotton. The counties in the Cangxian special district formulated specific increased production plans in a surge of careful accounting.

However, some counties, in order to study the restoration or exceeding of pre-war production levels, rigidly pursued the specific content of "pre-war and post-war levels," and some were even frightened by the difficulties in restoring or exceeding pre-war production levels. For example, in Cixian County, due to the passive and simplistic task-oriented thinking of the leadership, only difficulties were heard at the meetings, and the plan was set very low. Some counties also shouted slogans of increased production without careful calculation and detachment from reality, and the plan was set too high. The Linqing People's Representative Conference compared the pre-war, post-war, and current production conditions in a realistic manner. At the meeting, all the representatives believed that the production conditions of general villages had been restored to pre-war conditions, and then actively studied specific measures to increase production, striving to increase the existing production level by half or one-tenth. During the discussion, they identified three major difficulties: lack of bricks, lack of technology, and quicksand at the bottom of wells for well-digging. The presidium then convened a symposium with representatives who had experience in well-digging, concentrated the rich experience from various places, and solved this difficulty. At the meeting, the representatives made well-digging plans one after another, exceeding the county's task of 1,200 wells. The People's Representative Conference of Shahe County resolved to apply more fertilizer, increasing fertilizer application from three carts to four carts for irrigated land, and from one cart to one and a half carts for dry land. They organized mutual aid, mobilized 90% of women to go to the fields for production. They constructed water conservancy projects, purchasing 700 waterwheels throughout the year, digging 400 new wells, and opening two canals. They promoted improved varieties, cultivated meticulously, and eliminated 1,000 mu of wasteland.

	Revised Plans Based on Representatives' Opinions; Exceeding the Government's Original Increased Production Standard

The production plans revised by the People's Representative Conferences of various counties based on the opinions of all the representatives have a common characteristic: everyone's confidence is greatly boosted, and the general increased production standards have exceeded the standards of the draft proposed by the People's Governments of various counties, proving the consistency of the increased production tasks pointed out by the National Agricultural Conference and the Provincial Economic Conference with the demands of the masses; correcting the simplistic task-oriented view of some cadres who oppose the increased production tasks to the demands of the masses. Shahe County accepted the task of increasing grain production by more than 6.9 million catties at the Provincial Economic Conference, and the People's Representative Conference resolved to increase production by more than 8.22 million catties. Before the war, the average grain yield per mu was 188 catties, and last year the average grain yield per mu was 189 catties. This year, they are required to increase the average yield per mu by 21.2 catties, which is 3 catties more than required by the Provincial Economic Conference. The People's Representative Conference of Nangong County resolved that based on the pre-war average yield of 93 catties of seed cotton per mu, and an average of 85 catties last year, this year they would generally require an increase of 20 catties, and villages with better conditions would require an increase of 40 catties, which is 12 to 32 catties more than required by the Provincial Economic Conference. It was resolved to plant a total of 379,900 mu of cotton, exceeding the government's original draft plan by 22,600 mu. According to the calculations of the People's Representative Conferences of various counties, about 33% of the villages in the Xingtai special district have been restored to pre-war production levels, and they are required to increase by half or one-tenth this year; 67% of the villages are striving to restore to pre-war levels this year.

	Representatives from All Walks of Life Speak, Willing to Serve Production

The worker representatives (such as carpenters and ironworkers), business representatives, education representatives, and medical representatives at the People's Representative Conferences of various counties have all made plans to serve production, believing that: "Serving production is serving the people and serving the country," "If we do not serve production, our undertakings will have no meaning."

The government cadre representatives and the cadres attending the meetings received extremely beneficial education, enriched their production knowledge, and felt that they had a way to lead production.

The People's Representative Conferences of all walks of life that formulated the 1950 production plan became a mobilization meeting for the unity and production of people from all walks of life in the beginning of 1950; the People's Representative Conferences were praised as: "A conference for planning and managing the daily lives," and they felt honored to be accounting for the daily lives of the people of the entire county. After the meeting, under the guidance of the county and district governments, the representatives combined with village cadres to widely publicize the increased production resolutions of the People's Representative Conferences to the masses. Under the promotion of the representatives, various villages in the Handan special district launched family meetings and manure pile comparison campaigns during the Spring Festival, formulating household plans and village plans to ensure the realization of increased grain and cotton production in the entire county.

　　河北各县二届人民代表会议先后召开
    制定今年农业生产计划  信心百倍保证增产粮棉
    成为各界人民团结生产的动员大会
    【本报保定特讯】河北省各县人民政府，通过第二届各界人民代表会议，布置春耕生产。邯郸、邢台、石家庄、沧县、保定、通县、定县等专区八十余县于春节前均已先后召开，出席代表共计近二万人。各县各界人民代表会议，为贯彻争取今年农业生产在一般地区恢复到战前生产水平，各制定了一九五○年农业生产计划，决定了实现增产任务的具体措施。代表们充满了实现增产计划的信心。邯郸、邢台专区大多数县的各界人民代表会议经过认真讨论后增产计划均超过省、专区对各该县增产要求的百分之十到百分之三十不等。在会议上政府代表向各界代表详尽说明各种生产政策，并经过代表们反复讨论，打通思想，各阶层代表完全同意并热烈拥护共产党和人民政府的团结生产发家致富的政策，坚决表示为开展大生产运动而努力。
    各县代表中，有约占代表总数四分之一到六分之一的生产积极分子、生产模范与劳动英雄当选了代表，他们成为会议讨论中最好的教师。会前，邯郸、邢台、沧县专区各县均派工作组调查了不同村庄的增产条件，制定全县增产计划草案，使会议讨论更加切合实际。
            会议三分之二时间讨论生产具体问题打消顾虑提高信心
    在时间掌握上各县会议一般只用三分之一甚或还少的时间作了去年生产工作检讨与一九五○年增产计划草案的报告；用三分之二甚或还多的时间进行小组讨论，专门问题如打井、植棉、组织互助的座谈会与听取劳动英模的典型报告。会议一般情况是：开始时代表们对增产计划非常感兴趣，但有些人疑虑水涨船高，“增产必增负担”；顾虑不久要吃“大锅饭”，抱着“生产不节约”的态度。同时，有些机关干部代表，对农民生产热情与发家的要求估计不足，夸大农民的某些顾虑与增产的困难。政府代表针对这一情况把奖励生产的负担、农贷、自由借贷、保障地权、财权等政策作了详细说明，英模在会上作了报告，他们告诉大家各种生产发家的事实，如成安县南小屯卖牛换骡子六十头，邯郸县东镇池现在有牲畜八十八头比战前增加了五十头等。又以生产模范村去年增产的收益启发大家精打细算，代表们的顾虑很快消失了，信心提高了，纷纷羡慕英模的光荣。交河县三十四位中农成份的代表纷纷说：“生产发家的大门，算是打开了。”
            精打细算热烈讨论  订出具体增产计划  集中经验解决困难
    明白了政策，代表们心里有了底，他们热烈讨论增产计划。如广宗县代表提出多施半车粪多打十五斤粮；棉花整修的好多摘十斤花。沧县专区各县在精打细算的算账热潮里订出具体的增产计划。
    但有些县为了研究恢复或超过战前生产水平，死板地追寻“战前、战后水平”的具体内容，有的甚至被恢复或超过战前生产水平中的困难吓住。如磁县，因领导思想上的消极的单纯任务观点，会议上只听到困难，计划订的很低。也有的县不曾精打细算，脱离实际地大喊增产，计划订的过高。临清人民代表会议实事求是的比较了战前、战后及眼下的生产条件，会上全体代表认为一般村庄的生产条件已恢复到战前情况，进而积极研究各项增产的具体措施，争取把现有生产水平提高半成或一成，在讨论中，他们找出打井缺砖、缺技术、井底流沙等三大困难，主席团便召集打井有经验的代表座谈，集中了各地丰富的经验，解决了这一困难。会上代表们纷纷作出打井计划，超过了全县一千二百眼井的任务。沙河县各界人民代表会议决议多施肥，水地由施肥三车再增施一车，旱地由施肥一车再增施半车。组织互助，发动百分之九十的妇女下地生产。兴修水利，全年买水车七百辆，打新井四百眼，开渠二道。推广优良品种，精耕细作，并消灭荒地一千亩。
            根据代表意见修订计划  超过政府原定增产标准
    各县各界人民代表会议，根据全体代表的意见修改后的生产计划，有一个共同的特点：大家信心百倍高涨，一般的增产标准都超过了各县人民政府所提草案的标准，证明全国农业会议与省经济会议指出的增产任务与群众要求的一致性；纠正了某些干部把增产任务与群众要求对立起来的单纯任务观点。沙河县在省经济会议上接受增产粮食六百九十余万斤的任务，人民代表会议决议增产八百二十二万余斤。战前每亩平均产粮一八八斤，去年每亩平均产粮一八九斤，今年要求每亩平均增产二一·二斤粮。较省经济会议要求的多增产三斤。南宫县各界人民代表会议根据战前每亩平均产籽棉九十三斤，去年平均已达八十五斤，决议今年一般要求增产二十斤，条件较好村庄要求增产四十斤。较省经济会议要求多增产十二斤至三十二斤。决议共种植棉花三十七万九千九百余亩，较政府原草案的规定超过二万二千六百亩。根据各县人民代表会议计算的结果，邢台专区约百分之三十三的村庄已恢复到战前生产水平，今年要求再提高半成或一成；百分之六十七的村庄争取于今年恢复到战前水平。
            各界代表发言  愿为生产服务
    各县各界人民代表会议上的工人代表（如木工、铁工）、商界代表、教育界代表、医界代表均发表了为生产服务的计划，认为：“为生产服务就是为人民为国家服务”，“不为生产服务，我们作的事业，就没有什么意义了。”
    机关干部代表及列席的干部，在会议中获得极有益的教育，丰富了生产知识，感到领导生产有办法了。
    制定一九五○年生产计划的各界人民代表会议，成为一九五○年年初的各界人民团结生产的动员大会；各界人民代表会议誉为：“盘算过日子的大会”，他们为替全县老百姓算当家过日子的账而感到光荣。会后，在各县区政府指导下，代表们结合村干部向群众广泛宣传人民代表会议的增产决议。邯郸专区各村在代表们推动下开展了春节开家庭会与比粪堆运动，订户计划、村计划，保证全县增产粮、棉的实现。
