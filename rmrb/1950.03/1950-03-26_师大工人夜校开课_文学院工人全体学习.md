　　Normal University Workers' Night School Opens
    All Workers in the Department of Chinese Literature Participate in Learning
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Workers' Night School of Beijing Normal University opened on the 22nd. All workers in the Department of Chinese Literature, except for a few who could not leave their posts, enrolled for study. More than ten students from the university serve as teachers for the Workers' Night School. The school had a Workers' Night School last semester. Because the workers had an uneven foundation in the three courses—Mandarin, Arithmetic, and Political Common Sense—some only studied one course. Before the start of this semester, according to the instructions of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions regarding the teaching of Workers' Night Schools, a placement test was held. Workers whose levels in each subject were inconsistent could study across classes. For example, if their Mandarin level was at the second-grade level, but their arithmetic was only at the first-grade level, they would study Mandarin in the second grade and arithmetic in the first grade. In this way, the tendency to study only one subject was overcome, and teaching was also made easier. For a few workers who could not leave their posts (such as those in the bicycle storage room and the reception room), the school also adopted a method of mutual assistance learning, where workers who had attended classes would go back and teach them. At the same time, teachers from the night school would also use mobile teaching methods to guide their learning.

　　师大工人夜校开课
    文学院工人全体学习
    【本报讯】北京师范大学工人夜校已于二十二日开课。该校文学院工人除少数不能离开工作者外，全部报名参加了学习。工人夜校教师由师大学生十余人担任。该校在上学期曾设有工人夜校，工友们因国语、算术、政治常识三项课程的基础不平衡，有人就单学某一门课程。本期开学之前，曾依照市总工会关于工人夜校教学的指示，举行过一次编级考试，工友各科程度不一致的可以跨班学习，例如国语程度够二年级的水平，但算术只有一年级的程度，就在二年级学国语，在一年级学算术，这样，克服了单学一门的偏向，教学也方便了。对于不能离开工作岗位的（如存车室、传达室等处）几个工友，该校并采用互助学习的方法，由上了课的工友回去教他们；同时也由夜校教师以流动教学的方法去指导他们学习。
