Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th: TASS, Moscow – The Moscow Gorky Works Research Conference was held on the 28th to commemorate the 82nd anniversary of Gorky's birth. The well-known Chinese writer Xiao San also attended the memorial meeting and was warmly welcomed. Yegolin, Director of the Institute of World Literature of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, gave a report at the meeting entitled "Gorky Fighting for Peace." Fedorenko, Doctor of Linguistics, reported on the influence of Gorky's works in China, stating that no other foreign writer enjoys such love in China as Gorky. Almost all of Gorky's works have been translated into Chinese. Gorky appeared in China as such an artist, with every word arming the people who fought against centuries of feudal enslavement. According to incomplete estimates, since 1907, despite the suppression by the Kuomintang reactionary group, more than 100 kinds of Gorky's works have been published in China. There are already many books in China discussing Gorky's life and his works. Almost no Chinese writer does not touch on Gorky's topics to a greater or lesser extent. The famous modern Chinese writer, scientist, and politician Guo Moruo once wrote that Chinese writers admire Gorky, love him, and follow his example. His life is praised as a perfect example, and his works have as great an influence in China as in the Soviet Union.

　　高尔基作品在中国
    享有人民无比爱戴
    莫斯科高尔基作品研究会上费多廉科报告
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十八日，莫斯科举行高尔基作品研究会，以纪念高尔基诞生的八十二周年。中国著名作家萧三亦出席纪念会，并受到热诚欢迎。苏联世界文学研究所所长叶高林，以“为和平而斗争的高尔基”为题在会上作了报告。语言学博士费多廉科就高尔基的作品在给中国所发生的影响作报告称：没有任何其他外国作家像高尔基一样在中国享有这样的爱戴。高尔基的一切作品几乎都已译成中文。高尔基作为这样的一个艺术家而在中国出现，即他的每一个辞语都武装了为反对许多世纪以来的封建奴役而斗争的人民。根据不完全的估计，自一九○七年以来，虽有国民党反动集团的压制，高尔基的著作已有一百种以上在中国出版。中国已有许多论述高尔基的生平及其著作的书籍。几乎没有一个中国作家不或多或少地涉及高尔基的论题的。著名的现代中国作家、科学家和政治家郭沫若曾经写道：中国作家崇敬高尔基，热爱他，效法他的榜样，他的生平被称颂为完美无瑕的范例，他的作品在中国的影响有如在苏联一样的大。
