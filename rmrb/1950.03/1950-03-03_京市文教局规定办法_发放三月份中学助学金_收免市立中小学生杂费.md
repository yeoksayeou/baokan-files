　　Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education Stipulates Methods
    Issuing Middle School Student Aid for March
    Collecting/Exempting Fees for Municipal Primary and Secondary School Students
    [Beijing News] The People's Student Aid for March for municipal and private secondary schools in Beijing will be distributed in two batches. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education has stipulated the following distribution methods: The first batch will be distributed on March 7th. All students who originally received student aid in the previous semester and have now registered at the school, and whose economic situation has not changed, are required to submit two copies of the list of recipients before March 5th to the Bureau for review before the funds are issued. The second batch is scheduled to be distributed on March 25th. All students who originally received student aid but arrived at school more than five days after the start of this semester, or students who are preparing to adjust their grade this semester, as well as newly enrolled students this semester, are required to classify and compile two copies of the list before March 20th, together with the application form and related materials, and submit them to the Bureau for review and approval before creating a list for distribution. The amount of student aid for private secondary schools is limited by the total budget. The sum of the amount of rice applied for by the second batch of students and the amount of rice received by the first batch shall not exceed the percentage and actual amount of rice received by each school in January of this year. Students receiving student aid from private middle schools that have been approved to close by the Bureau, who transfer to other middle schools in the city, will have their March student aid issued according to the original grade based on the original school certificate. In the future, it will be handled the same as general new applications, according to the situation of each school. If the graded students of municipal secondary schools come from private secondary schools on their own initiative and received student aid in the original school, they will be given half a month's worth of aid according to the original grade.
    [This newspaper dispatch] As the opening of municipal middle and primary schools in Beijing is imminent, the Municipal Bureau of Education, after submitting a request and receiving approval from the Municipal People's Government, has made the following decisions regarding the standards for collecting and exempting miscellaneous fees for each school and the methods of collection:
    A. Fee Standards:
    1. Secondary Schools: High school students pay 50 catties of millet per person, and junior high school students pay 40 catties of millet per person.
    2. Primary Schools (including kindergartens, the same below): Students in urban areas pay 15 catties of millet per person, and students in suburban areas pay 10 catties of millet per person.
    The above millet is calculated and converted into Renminbi according to the average of the wholesale and retail prices of local millet and imported millet listed in the People's Daily on the day the student pays the fee.
    B. Free Standards:
    1. Students of normal schools, technical education schools, and schools for the deaf and mute are completely exempt from miscellaneous fees.
    2. Children of poor workers and other working people and students receiving People's Student Aid are exempt from miscellaneous fees.
    3. Number of free students in ordinary middle and primary schools: Middle schools generally should not exceed 25% of the total number of students in the school (an increase of 5% compared to the previous semester). Primary schools in urban areas generally should not exceed 30% of the total number of students in the school (the same as the previous semester). Primary schools in suburban areas generally should not exceed 70% of the total number of students in the school (an increase of 20% compared to the previous semester).
    C. Collection Methods:
    The same as the previous semester. Secondary schools directly remit to the Finance Bureau; primary schools in urban areas are transferred to the Finance Bureau by the central primary school, and primary schools in suburban areas are transferred to the Finance Bureau by the district government.
