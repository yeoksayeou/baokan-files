To the Editor:

　　Having read the article "The Construction of Wang Wenshan Stove" and Figure 1 in the People's Garden on March 24th, I would like to add a supplement because its explanation is not complete enough. Many people in this city use this kind of stove, mostly poor households or small handicraft factories. Because they are all self-made, the styles also vary slightly. The design constructed by Comrade Wang Wenshan is the best, but most use furnace bars, and few use iron plates.

　　For such stoves, removing ash is the most troublesome thing, but the newspaper did not explain it. Usually, two movable bricks are built at the bottom of the stove, leading directly to the ash storage area. When the ash is too much or about to be full, the movable bricks can be removed to take out the ash, and then re-sealed with mud. This method has many shortcomings. If the gap for storing ash is too large, it will weaken the air flow; if the gap is too small, dismantling and re-sealing every day to remove ash is very troublesome. To remedy these shortcomings, someone invented a good method as follows:

　　Use a square brick with a round hole in the middle. The two sides of the hole are not the same size. The diameter of the bottom surface is about two inches, and the diameter of the top surface is about three inches. Grind another brick into a round ball, and make sure it fits in the hole of the square brick so that it cannot leak out. (Note that the hole and the ball must be round, and the ball must fit tightly in the hole so that there are no gaps, otherwise the air flow will be weakened.) After it is made, build it under the furnace bars or iron plate and air duct, about three inches away from the furnace bars. When there is too much ash, lift the brick ball upward with a fire hook, and the ash will leak out. This method was passed down from farmers in Wen'an County, Hebei Province. It is not only labor-saving and convenient, but also helps the air flow.

### 对于“王文善炉灶”的补充

　　对于“王文善炉灶”的补充编辑同志：
    读三月二十四日人民园地“王文善炉灶的构造”及图一文，因其说明还不够完全，所以我想加一补充。该炉灶本市使用者很多，大多数都是贫户或小手工业工厂，因为都是自己制造，所以样式也略异，按王文善同志所构造的图样是最佳者，但多用炉条，用铁板者却少见。
    这样的炉灶掏炉灰是件最麻烦的事，报上却未加说明。普通多是在炉灶的最下面砌两块活砖，直通存炉灰处，炉灰多了或将满时，可将活砖拆下，把炉灰取出，再用泥土砌好。这种办法有很多缺点，如果存炉灰的空隙太大了，有损风力；若是空隙太小，则每天掏炉灰拆砌是件很麻烦的事。为了补救这些缺点，就有人发明了一个好办法如下：
    用方砖一块，中间挖一圆孔，孔的两面不一般大，底面的直径约二寸，上面的直径约三寸许，用另一块砖磨成圆球，放在方砖的孔里漏不出去为合适。（注意孔与球要圆，球放在孔内如何也不能离缝才好，否则有损风力。）制好后，砌在炉条或铁板及风筒的下面，约离炉条三寸许即可。炉灰多时，用火钩往上一托砖球炉灰即漏出。此法传自河北省文安县乡农，不但省事方便，且有助风力。一都
