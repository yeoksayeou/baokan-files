　　Beijing Municipality Public Bond Promotion Association
    Urges Local Figures to Purchase Bonds
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to complete the first phase of public bond sales by the end of March as stipulated by the Central People's Government, the Beijing Municipality Public Victory Real Value Public Bond Promotion Association and local figures sub-associations convened the second city-wide local figures conference at the Democratic Theater on the 23rd. Approximately 800 people attended, including standing committee members of the local figures sub-associations and local figures from various districts. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu and Deputy Mayor Wu Han, director of the Municipal Public Bond Promotion Association, were present and delivered speeches. The conference was chaired by Dong Ruqin, deputy director of the local figures sub-association and director of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. After Le Songsheng, director of the local figures sub-association, reported on the significance of the meeting, Deputy Mayor Wu Han spoke, pointing out: The Beijing business community has guaranteed to complete the task of purchasing public bonds by the end of March. Military, government, industrial, cultural, and educational organizations and groups throughout the city have already exceeded their public bond purchase quotas, and now only local figures remain. We must complete our city's glorious task of purchasing public bonds before the end of March, and not "lose all our work for one final setback"! He said: Local figures have not served the people's revolutionary war in the past, and purchasing public bonds is a good opportunity to compensate. And now the soldiers at the front are still bleeding, and the workers and peasants in the rear are sweating. Local figures living in the city, living and working in peace and contentment, if they are not willing to contribute even this bit of strength, it is unjustifiable. Deputy Mayor Zhang then spoke, praising some people who took the lead in purchasing public bonds, analyzing various incorrect ideas about not wanting to purchase public bonds, and severely criticizing them, advising them to consciously purchase quickly and stop waiting and seeing. After Deputy Mayor Zhang's speech, Feng Zhanhai and Zheng Zipan, standing committee members of the local figures public bond promotion sub-association, spoke successively, calling on local figures to subordinate individual interests to the interests of the whole, and to the interests of the country and the nation, and to automatically strive to complete the purchase task before the end of March. Finally, Chairman Dong Ruqin spoke at the end of the conference, once again pointing out that the key to whether Beijing Municipality's public bond sales task can be completed this time lies with the local figures, and everyone must pay attention and work hard.

　　京市推销公债总会
    督促地方人士购债
    【京市新闻处讯】京市推销人民胜利折实公债总会及地方人士分会为按照中央人民政府规定在三月底以前如期完成第一期公债的推销任务，特于二十三日在民主剧场召开全市地方人士第二次大会，到地方人士分会常委及各区地方人士约八百人。市府张友渔副市长、市推销公债总会主任吴晗副市长均亲临讲话。大会由地方人士分会副主任、市府民政局长董汝勤主席。在地方人士分会主任乐松生报告开会意义后，吴晗副市长继起讲话，他指出：京市工商界已保证在三月底完成购买公债的任务。全市军、政、工、文教机关团体购买公债已经超过数字，现在只剩下地方人士了。我们必须在三月底前完成我们全市购买公债的光荣任务，不要“为山九仞，功亏一篑”！他说：地方人士过去没有为人民革命战争服务过，购买公债正是一个补偿的好机会。而现在前方战士还在流血，后方工人农民在流汗，生活在城市里面的地方人士，安居乐业，假使连这点力量都不愿意出，是说不过去的。继由张副市长讲话，他表扬了某些带头购买公债的人，分析了各种不愿购买公债的不正确想法，并加以严厉批评，劝告他们自觉地迅速购买，勿再观望。张副市长讲话后，先后有地方人士推销公债分会常委冯占海、郑子磐讲话，他们号召地方人士要以个人的利益服从全体的利益，服从国家、民族的利益，自动努力于三月底以前完成购买的任务。大会最后由主席董汝勤讲话，他又一次指出：北京市此次推销公债任务完成与否的中心关键在地方人士方面，大家必须注意努力。
