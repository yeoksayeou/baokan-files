    First Batch of Trade Grain Dispatched
    [Our Newspaper] In order to support disaster areas and meet urban grain needs, the first batch of trade grain from Changzhi Special District has been dispatched. From March 6th to 13th, over 6.72 million jin of grain were transported via three routes (Handan, Jiaozuo, Jinzhong) in eight days. This grain transportation saw few problems, due to the establishment of grain transportation committees from top to bottom, where all issues were studied and resolved in a unified manner. On the other hand, cadres had consistent ideological understanding and cooperated well. For example, in terms of grain dispatch: the grain depot dispatched, the company received, and the government was responsible for transportation; when vehicles arrived, they left immediately, without wasting manpower. In terms of grain collection: due to the conscientious implementation of the agreement, vehicles were received as soon as they arrived. For example, Handan stipulated that a minimum of 600,000 jin should be prepared for collection each day.
    The completion of this task was mainly due to: (1) Unified arrangement of dispatch and receipt work, and timely mobilization of transportation vehicles. The Commissioner's Office, based on the transportation capacity of each county, combined with the location of the inventory and taking into account the spring plowing season, appropriately allocated transportation tasks to civilian vehicles. (2) Mastering the dispatch situation, a bi-daily reporting system for the grain transportation committee was established, and work was checked in a timely manner to resolve problems that arose. (3) Civilian vehicles were generally organized into groups and teams, with cadres selected to lead them. For example, Xiangyuan County used the district as a transportation brigade (with the district cadre as the brigade commander), the village as a detachment, and then divided them into several groups (about ten vehicles) based on the type of livestock and speed. (4) Providing for the food and lodging of civilian vehicles. Each county sent cadres to the routes and designated locations (Handan direction: Shexian Henan Shop, Wu'an Yetao, Handan. Jiaozuo direction: Bo'ai, Sanwangzhuang Village) to mobilize local people to sell home-cooked meals, ensuring that livestock had grass and feed, and without raising market prices. According to civilian vehicles, it was truly ensured that there was no shortage of grass and feed on the Handan road, and market prices were not raised. (5) Ensuring the safety of civilian vehicles. Doctors and veterinarians were generally mobilized to provide treatment along the way. Jincheng County also added two treatment stations. (6) Grain pricing was generally based on the agreement, unifying the pricing of fiscal grain with the rice price for shipping costs. Lucheng County did a better job in this regard.
    However, due to the short time frame, the mobilization of civilian vehicles in some counties was not mature enough, resulting in more problems: for example, merchant transport vehicles were not well organized, increasing transportation costs; the freight of 13.5 jin per hundred li of small load civilian iron-wheeled vehicles was not enough to cover expenses, and vehicle households in the village who did not participate in transportation were allowed to subsidize the transportation vehicles with millet, creating a financial burden; or because there were few vehicles, people were mobilized to carry and livestock to carry, and the freight was not enough to cover expenses, so those who participated in transportation paid for their own travel expenses. Also, although the Commissioner's Office had clear instructions for roadside preparation work, some simply did not pay attention to it, resulting in broken pockets and vehicle problems that could not be repaired.

### 山西长治专区各县  首批贸易粮发运完毕

　　山西长治专区各县
    首批贸易粮发运完毕
    【本报讯】为支援灾区、城市粮食需要，长治专区第一批贸易粮发运，从三月六日至十三日的八天中，已分三路（邯郸、焦作、晋中）运出粮食六百七十二万多斤。此次运粮，由于自上而下的成立了运粮委员会，一切问题经过研究统一解决，故问题发生很少。另方面干部思想认识一致，互相配合很好。如在发粮方面：粮库发，公司接，政府负责运；车辆到达时，随来随走，并未浪费民力。在收粮方面：由于认真执行协议书规定，车辆到达时，随到随收。如邯郸每天规定最少要准备收六十万斤。
    这次任务的完成，主要由于：（一）统一布置发收工作，按时动员运输车辆进行运输。专署根据各县运输力，结合库存地点并照顾到春耕季节，适当分配民车运输任务。（二）掌握发运情况，规定了隔日制的运粮委员会汇报制并及时检查工作，解决所发生问题。（三）民车组织一般的都划分小组、分队，其中选择干部带领。如襄垣县以区为运输大队（区干部为大队长），村为分队，再以牲口种类快慢不同，分为若干小组（十辆左右）。（四）对民车食宿上照顾。各县派干部到路途上和到指定地点（邯郸方向：涉县河南店、武安冶陶、邯郸。焦作方向：博爱、三王庄村），发动当地群众卖家常便饭，保证牲口有草、有料，且不抬高市价。据民车反映：此次邯郸路上真的做到了不缺草料，也没抬高市价。（五）保证民车安全。普遍发动医生及兽医，准备在路途上进行治疗。晋城县还增设了两处治疗站。（六）粮食作价，一般的根据协议书规定，把财政粮作价与发运费米价统一起来。这一点潞城县做的较好。
    但由于时间短促，动员民车有的县不够成熟，故发生的问题较多：如商运车没组织好，加大了运费开支；载重量小的民运铁轮车，百里百斤十三斤半运费不够开支。而让本村不参加运输的车户给运输车贴补小米，形成财力负担；或因车少发动人担、牲口驮，运费不够开支，由参加运输的自行贴盘缠费。又如路途准备工作专署虽有明确指示，但有的根本就没重视，以致口袋破了，车有毛病，无法修理。
