    Railway Regulations Should Be Followed When Taking the Train
    To the Editors:
    On a train from Beijing to Shanghai, one of our comrades fell ill. We opened up a berth for him to lie down in our rented second-class sleeper. Although it was during the day, there were no passengers coming or going on either side, above or below. However, the train conductor did not allow it and ordered the attendant to remove the bedding.

    Also, our comrades in the second-class seats were tired and wanted to take turns sleeping with the comrades who had sleeper tickets, but the train conductor did not allow it. We don't know why, and hope to get an answer.
    Zhu Deqin

    To the Editors:
    I went home on December 1st, carrying my school passport. My train ticket to Shimen was half-price, and to Fengtai it was also half-price. When I returned to the team from home on the 11th of this month, I arrived at Anding Station around 2 p.m. and bought a full-price ticket. The stationmaster said that our North China Military and Political University is not a field army, and the passport is not valid. Please give me an answer, editors, is this correct?
    Sun Hai, North China Military and Political University

    To the Editors:
    Each train line has seats for military personnel, and other passengers are not allowed to sit there without the conductor's permission, but the Beijing-Hankou Railway (Beijing-Baoding section) has not implemented this regulation well. In name, it is a seat for military personnel, but in reality, it is filled with passengers, leaving many soldiers without a place to sit. We hope that the train conductors and attendants on the Beijing-Hankou (Beijing-Baoding section) trains will earnestly take responsibility and implement this regulation of the Ministry of Railways.

    To Comrades Zhu Deqin, Sun Hai, and Ma Yuyin:
    Regarding the letters of inquiry about railway operations you sent us on December 17th of last year, we have instructed the Tianjin Railway Bureau to investigate the facts and report them to us. Specific responses are as follows:

    1.  Reply to Comrade Zhu Deqin: The sale of sleeper tickets is calculated on a per-night basis and cannot be exchanged for use by others. The bedding must be removed during the day. These are all provisions of the railway regulations. The passenger train conductor and attendant's handling of this matter is in accordance with the regulations, but they were not patient in explaining to the passengers and their conversation was somewhat rude, causing dissatisfaction. We have instructed the Beijing Train Depot to review and correct this.

    2.  Reply to Comrade Sun Hai: It has been verified that the ticket seller at Anding Station mistakenly identified North China Military and Political University as a non-formal military unit and did not provide the half-price discount, which was wrong. In addition to criticizing the staff member and having him admit his mistake, the Tianjin Railway Bureau will purchase stamps worth eight hundred and fifty yuan for the overcharged fare and send them to Comrade Sun Hai through you along with a letter of apology.

    3.  Reply to Comrade Ma Yuyin: According to the military transportation regulations, when passengers are crowded and there are empty seats in the military car, passengers and railway staff may sit there with the conductor's permission, provided it does not affect the military personnel's seating. However, it often happens that passengers or railway employees squeeze into the military car on their own without the conductor's permission, which is incorrect. Regarding this point, the bureau has been instructed to notify the conductors of all passenger trains to monitor the situation at all times and correct the above-mentioned shortcomings.

### 乘火车应遵守铁路规章

    乘火车应遵守铁路规章编辑同志：
    从北京开往上海的火车上，我们有一位同志因为中途害病，在我们租用的二等卧铺中，拉开一个位置让他睡下，时间虽然是在白天，但左右上下并无乘客来往。可是，列车长不许可，命令车员把铺撤了。
    又我们在二等座位上的同志累了，想与有卧铺票的同志轮留交换睡一下，列车长也不许可。这不知道为什么，希望能得到解答。
    朱德禽编辑同志：
    我在十二月一日回家，带有我校护照，在石门搭火车票是半票，至丰台也是半票；本月十一号由家回队时，下午两点钟左右到安定车站，买的却是整票。站长说，我们华北军政大学不是野战军，护照不管用，请编辑同志给答复一下，这样是否对？
    华北军政大学孙海编辑同志：
    各线列车都有军人乘坐席，没有列车长许可，其他旅客是不准混坐的，但是京汉路（京保段）却没有很好执行这规章。名义上是军人乘坐席，但实际是给客占满了，弄的好多军人反而没有地方。希望平汉（京保段）列车长和服务员同志们要切实负起责任来，执行铁道部这一规章。
    华北军区政治部电影队  马玉印编辑同志：
    上年十二月十七日你们转来旅客朱德禽、孙海、马玉印三人对铁路业务质询函件，经饬天津路局将经过事实查报前来，特分别答复于后：
    一、复朱德禽同志：睡铺票的发售系按夜计算，不得与人交换使用，白天一定要拆铺，这都是路章的规定。客运车长及列车员对这事的处理，与定章是符合的，但对于旅客不能耐心解释，谈话有些粗率致使对方不满，此点已饬北京车务段进行检讨并纠正。
    二、复孙海同志：经查明安定站售票员误认华北军政大学为非正式军队未按半价优待，是错误的，除对该员予以批评并由他承认错误外，对多收的票款八百五十元，由天津路局买作邮票连同道歉信件托你们转交孙海同志。
    三、复马玉印同志：根据军运条例规定，旅客拥挤，军人车内有空位，在不影响军人乘坐时，经车长允许，旅客和路员均可乘坐，不过常有旅客或铁路员工，未经车长许可，自行挤上军人车内，是不对的，关于此点已令知该局转饬各次客运车长，随时掌握情况，改正上项缺点。
        中央人民政府铁道部启一九五○年三月三日
