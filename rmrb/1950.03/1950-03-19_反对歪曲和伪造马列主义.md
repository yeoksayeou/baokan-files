　　Oppose the Distortion and Falsification of Marxism-Leninism
　　Shi Tuo
　　Due to the nationwide liberation, Marxism-Leninism has been disseminated on an unprecedentedly wide scale, and is being enthusiastically studied and researched by the vast number of intellectuals. This is a matter of the utmost importance for the education of the Chinese people and the transformation of intellectuals. However, the vast majority of people have only just come into contact with Marxism-Leninism, and their thirst for Marxist-Leninist doctrines has almost reached the point of indiscriminate consumption. Thus, all kinds of false Marxism-Leninism have gained the opportunity to pass off fish eyes as pearls in the "ideological" market and deceive readers.
　　At such a time, maintaining the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and resolutely struggling against all "theories" that distort, tarnish, or impersonate Marxism-Leninism anytime and anywhere, is a major task on the ideological front, including the literary and art front. On the one hand, we must carry out the popularization of Marxism-Leninism on the widest scale; on the other hand, in order to maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism, we must resolutely expose all Marxist-Leninist disguises and reveal their true colors to the masses.
　　The article "A Brief Discussion on Positive and Negative Characters" by Zhang Huairui in the second issue of the Shanghai literary journal "Starting Point" is a falsification that must be exposed. Regardless of the author's subjective intentions, this article is filled with Marxist-Leninist phrases, but in reality, it completely violates the Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic thought.
　　It begins by quoting a passage from a book review by Marx in the "New Rheinische Zeitung," and immediately draws a conclusion completely contrary to the original meaning from this passage as its own argument. It says that Marx opposed literary works depicting great men as unrealistic figures wearing short boots and halos, but praised the "in-depth private life" depiction method or creative method, and cited two works as examples -- these two works "due to delving into the private lives of these characters... even if they are far from faithfully describing realistic characters and events, Marx specially put them forward to us as an example, even a direction." This means that, "according to Marx," "delving into the private lives of characters" is the direction of creation, as if political life and social struggle have nothing to do with this "direction." Therefore, it immediately asks: "Then, how should we write positive characters?" The answer should naturally be, and must be, "write the private lives of positive characters."
　　But how many people would not doubt such "Marxism"? It is true that unrealistic depictions with halos are undesirable, but will "faithful descriptions" that "delve into private lives" lead literature and art onto the correct path? Obviously, it is impossible. For the sake of caution, we might as well spend a little more space studying Marx's original text and intention. First, let's look at the quotation used by the author:
　　"'How desirable it would be to depict all the forerunners of every party movement, whether before the revolution, in various associations and publications, or after the social revolution in open positions, with the colors of solid symbolism full of life. And the descriptions have never written out such figures in a realistic posture, they are always written as divine, writing their formulaic forms -- wearing short boots, wearing halos. This glorified Raphael-style portraiture loses all descriptive authenticity.
　　"'Here are two works that completely abandoned the short boots and halos worn by the "great men" of the February Revolution. It delves into the private lives of these characters, puts them in ordinary clothes, and shows us them together with the various characters around them. However, even so, it is still far from a faithful description of realistic characters and events.'"
　　The translation used by the author has errors. A more accurate translation should be:
　　"The most desirable thing would be to finally depict those who stood at the head of the revolutionary parties before the revolution, in secret societies or in newspaper offices, or after the revolution in official positions, in strong Rembrandt-like colors, with all their lively qualities. These people have never been depicted as they really were; they are represented as officials, wearing short boots, with haloes emitting light. In this Raphael-style deification of beauty, all the truth of painting is lost.
　　"The two books criticized here are rid of the short boots and haloes that the 'great men' of the February Revolution always wore. They went into the private lives of these people, showing them in slippers, together with all their various attendants. But this does not mean that these two books are in the slightest closer to a faithful depiction of characters and events." (Translated from "Marx-Engels on Literature and Art," published by International Publishers, 1947, page 40.)
　　Of course, we can now see that the erroneous translation that harms readers must also bear its due responsibility. But this is not enough to reduce the guilt of the author who insults Marx. Because immediately after the translation he quoted, Marx has these very clear two sentences:
　　"One of these authors is Louis Philippe's public spy who accompanied him for many years. The other is a veteran professional conspirator who has an ambiguous relationship with the police station."
　　Why did the author, who stole Marxist-Leninist phrases, conceal these two sentences and make the sinful inference that Marx recommended the writings of spies to us as "examples" and "directions"?
　　Then, anyone can understand that it is not Marx but this thief who is promoting depictions that delve into private lives, it is not Marxist-Leninist literary theory but this thief's "theory" that wants to guide literary creation towards that "direction" that violates Marxism-Leninism!
　　Then, anyone can understand that Marx taught writers to grasp true realism with profound political and ideological content, and while opposing unrealistic and deified depictions, he opposed "delving into private lives" and vulgarizing the dignity of revolutionary leaders. But this thief precisely abandoned the profound political and ideological content, took out the vulgarized, decadent class's magic weapon of depicting "private life, slippers, and attendants" and said to everyone: "This is Marx's realism!" And this is not accidental at all, but precisely in line with the entire tone and central idea of his article. And his arguments and ideas are of course decorated with Marxist-Leninist phrases.
　　His central idea is: although class stand, or worldview, or politics, are "not unimportant," and can be considered "one of the weapons," "realism" is "extremely important," not only "also one of the weapons," but will even make "great victories" over the worldview!
　　His central idea is: since the workers, peasants, and soldiers have come to power, there is no way around it, so let's just say they are the "protagonists" "in a historical sense," "but it is quite inappropriate to simply and mechanically propose the question to literature and art." "In order to truthfully reflect reality, other classes can also be regarded as protagonists;""If only the workers, peasants, and soldiers play the solo, that is a struggle without a target of struggle," what does it count for? Without Chiang Kai-shek, would there still be a Communist Party? "Think about it, or take a look, who are the protagonists in the works of Balzac or Tolstoy? What class?" Are they the workers, peasants, and soldiers you are calling for? But they "achieved great victories."
　　Enough, enough!
　　We know that the most basic principle of Marxist-Leninist literary theory is that literature and art are subordinate to politics, and creative methods are subordinate to worldview. Of course, politics is not simply equal to literature and art, and worldview is not simply equal to creative methods. In feudal or capitalist societies, a writer who is truly faithful to reality, conscientious, and talented may break through the worldview limited by his class in his creation and achieve a truthful depiction of reality. But in socialist societies, or societies under the people's democratic dictatorship, the people's literature and art must be subordinate to the people's politics, and revolutionary realism must be subordinate to the revolutionary, proletarian worldview. This is an unswerving truth.
　　Engels used Balzac as an example to indicate that realism can achieve victory against a reactionary worldview, but he did not say that realism can even achieve victory against a revolutionary, proletarian worldview. Today, our primary issue is to gradually master and consolidate this eternally invincible revolutionary, proletarian worldview, not to oppose realism and worldview, to depict realism as a super-era, super-class magic weapon that can go its own way apart from worldview, to reduce the importance of worldview to a dispensable position, and in practice to deny the great role of class stand and worldview, which is to abolish the principle of the Party spirit of literature and art, which is the soul of Marxist-Leninist literary theory.
　　The working people have always been the creators of history, but until now, this deserved position has never been reflected in literature and art. But today, the Chinese working people have become the masters of the country, and today's problem is not that the position of workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art has "surpassed" or at least corresponded to their position in historical or political significance, but that it lags behind and falls behind this position in historical and political significance. When the feudal class or the bourgeoisie were protagonists on the stage of history, they both demanded and gained the protagonist position in literature and art, and now the working people more than ten million times more justifiably demand this position, but this author, whose first sentence is Marx and whose last sentence is also Marx, shakes his head and says "inappropriate"! Similarly, the uneven distribution of positive and negative characters, not from individual works but from the entire literature and art, is also an unquestionable matter. That is why we must call on and mobilize the vast number of literary and art workers to face the new people and face the positive characters. Saying that positive and negative characters are indistinguishable and equally important is exactly the same as giving up the in-depth exploration of positive characters, which is exactly the same as violating the main task that history has handed over to literature and art: to express the new characters of the new China. Soviet literature and art is our best example. For more than thirty years, it has constantly whipped negative characters, but the main thing is to express the growth of "new Soviet people" and "socialist people," and has achieved unparalleled brilliant achievements. But this thief who stole the phrases of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao advocates not distinguishing between importance; in his view, the problem of positive and negative characters is meaningless, "the problem lies in the stand and attitude." Yes, stand and attitude are not only a "problem," but a fundamental problem. But this author's "theoretical" system is like this: workers, peasants, and soldiers and other classes? -- it lies in the stand and attitude; positive characters and negative characters? -- it lies in the stand and attitude. Stand and attitude? -- it lies in realism. Realism? -- please look at Balzac! Everything boils down to Balzac, even if we don't have half a Balzac in China, but "Marxism-Leninism" is so decreed! -- Because, "However, Balzac did not distort reality more or less due to his favoring the declining aristocracy and opposing the emerging bourgeoisie"! "If a writer can be faithful to reality, -- then, for example, even if he did not originally acquire the stand of the people, like Balzac, he can consciously or unconsciously reflect reality flesh and blood, and reveal the popular side of it"! This is his central idea. This is what he wants to use so many Marxist-Leninist phrases to preach to us.
　　Then, everyone understands, right? Quoting Marx is to prove the creative direction of delving into private life; quoting Mao Zedong's "Our literature and art is first and foremost for the workers, peasants, and soldiers" is to prove that workers, peasants, and soldiers and other classes are indistinguishable; quoting Engels' "great victory of realism" is to prove that realism conquers worldview or class stand; quoting Lenin on Tolstoy is to prove the popular nature of Tolstoy's works. "The key lies entirely in being faithful to reality and grasping the artistic method of realism" -- as for Tolstoy's religious beliefs, agricultural communist ideas, populist political ideas, etc., are of course completely irrelevant. Things like this, isn't this the greatest distortion and defilement of Marxism-Leninism?
　　This is why we are making a stern criticism of this article. Fighting for the purity of Marxism-Leninism is a huge and long-term task, and especially on the literary and artistic front where theoretical criticism work is relatively undeveloped, we need to intensify our efforts.

　　反对歪曲和伪造马列主义
    史笃
    由于全国解放，马列主义学说得到空前广泛的传播，被广大知识分子所热烈学习和研究。这对中国人民的教育，与对知识分子的改造，都是具有最重大意义的事情。但是绝大多数人对马列主义学说还是刚刚接触，而且大家对马列主义学说的渴求又几乎达到了饥不择食的地步，于是一切的假马列主义就得到了在“思想”市场上鱼目混珠、欺骗读者的机会了。
    在这样的时候，保持马列主义学说的纯洁性，随时随地向一切歪曲、玷污马列主义的、冒充马列主义的“理论”作坚决的斗争，是思想战线，包含文艺战线上的一个重大的任务。我们一方面要进行最广泛地传播马列主义学说的通俗化的工作；另一方面为了保持马列主义学说的纯洁性，就必须坚决揭露一切马列主义伪装，使它们在群众面前露出原形来。
    上海出版的文艺刊物《起点》第二期上，张怀瑞作《略论正面人物与反面人物》一文，就是一个必须加以揭发的伪造物。不管作者的主观意图如何，这篇文章堆满了马列主义词句，而实际是完全违反马列主义的文艺思想的。
    它一开头就引用了马克思在《新莱茵评论》上发表的一篇书评中的一段话，并且立即从这段话里做出和原意完全相反的推论，作为自己的论据。它说马克思反对文艺作品把伟人们描写成脚穿短靴、头带神光的非现实的形象，但是推崇“深入私生活”的描写法或创作方法，并举出两部作品为例——这两部作品“由于深入到这班人物的私生活中……即使它们离开忠实地来描写现实的人物和事件的地步还远得很，马克思却把它们作为一个范例，甚至方向，向我们特别地提了出来”。这就是说，“按照马克思”，“深入人物的私生活”才是创作的方向，至于什么政治生活，社会斗争，都和这“方向”无关。因此它紧接着发问：“那么，我们应该怎样来写正面人物呢？”那回答自然应该是并且必然是“写正面人物的私生活”了。
    但是对于这样的“马克思”主义，能有多少人不发生怀疑呢？不错，头带神光的非现实的描写是要不得的，可是“深入私生活”的“忠实描写”会引导文艺走上正确的道路吗？显然是不可能的。我们为了郑重起见，不妨多费点篇幅研究一下马克思的原文和本意。先看该文作者的引用：
    “‘无论在革命之前，在各种的结社和印刷品上面，或者是社会革命之后处于公开的地位上了，对于一切党的运动的前驱者，以充满全生命的坚实的象征风的色彩加以描写，是多么使人渴望的事情。而从来的描写，决不是在现实的姿态中写出这种人物来，他们总是被写得神乎其神，写他们公式的形态——脚穿短靴，头带神光。这种神化了的拉斐尔风的肖像画，是失却一切描写的真实性的。
    “‘这里有两部作品，是完全抛弃了从来的二月革命的“伟人们”所带着出现的短靴和神光的。它深入到这班人物的私生活中，使他穿上普通的服装，而和形形式式的跟在周围的人物一起，指示给我们看。但是，虽然如此，离开现实地的人物和事件的忠实描写，还远得很。’”
    引用者所根据的译文是有错误的。比较正确的译文应该是这样：
    “最渴望不过的事是把大革命之前在秘密结社里或报馆里的、或者革命之后身居官职的、那些站在革命政党的首脑地位的人们终于用强烈的冷布兰德式的色彩描绘出了他们的一切生动的品质。这些人们向来没有被描绘成他们的真实的样子；他们是被表现作官场人物，穿着短统靴，头上发出晕光。在这种拉斐尔式的美的神化之中，失掉了全部的绘画的真实性。
    “这里所批评的两本书是摆脱掉二月革命的‘大人物们’向来带着的短统靴和晕光了。它们走进了这些人的私生活，表现穿着拖鞋的他们，和他们的全体各种侍从们在一起。但这并不是说这两本书丝毫较接近于对人物和事件的忠实描写。”（译自美国国际出版社一九四七年出版的《马克思——恩格斯文艺论》第四十页。）
    当然，我们现在可以看出，谬误的贻害读者的译文也要负它应负的责任。但这丝毫不足以减轻污辱马克思的该文作者的罪过。因为紧接着他所引用的译文后面，马克思还有这么很明白的两句话：
    “这著者之一，是路易·菲烈普长年相随的公开的密探。另外一个是老牌的职业阴谋家，他跟警察局有暧昧的关系。”
    为什么盗用马列主义词句的该文作者把这两句话隐瞒起来，而做出马克思把特务的著作推荐给我们作“范例”和“方向”的罪恶推论呢？
    那么，谁都可以明白了，并不是马克思而是这位盗用者在提倡深入私生活的描写，并不是马列主义的文艺理论而是这位盗用者的“理论”，要引导文艺创作走向那个违反马列主义的“方向”！
    那么，谁都可以明白了，马克思是教导作家们掌握真正的、具有深广的政治内容和思想内容的现实主义，而在反对非现实的神化的描写同时，反对了“深入私生活的”把革命领袖人物的尊严卑俗化了的描写。但是这位盗用者恰恰割弃了深广的政治内容和思想内容，拿出描写“私生活，拖鞋和侍从”的、庸俗化了的、没落阶级的法宝对大家说：“这就是马克思的现实主义！”而他这却完全不是偶然的，正是符合于他这篇文章的整个论调和中心思想的。而他的那些论调和思想当然又是用马列主义的词句装饰着的。
    他的中心思想是：阶级立场、或世界观、或政治，虽然“不是不关重要的”，算是“武器之一”吧，可是“现实主义”却是“极关重要的”，不仅“同样是武器之一”，而且会做出对世界观的“伟大的胜利”来的！
    他的中心思想是：工农兵既然当了权，没有办法，就算它“在历史的意味上”是个“主角”吧，“但是如果把问题单纯地即机械地向文艺提出，却是颇欠妥当的。”“为了如实地反映现实，其他的阶级还是同样可以作为主角的；”“只有工农兵的主角唱独脚戏，那就是没有斗争对象的斗争”，算个什么呢？没有了蒋介石，还有共产党吗？“想一想吧，或者看一看吧，巴尔扎克或托尔斯泰的作品的主角，到底是些什么人？什么阶级？”是你们叫唤的工农兵吗？可是它们“获得了伟大的胜利”。
    够了，够了！
    我们知道，马列主义的文艺理论的最基本的原则，就是文艺服从于政治，创作方法服从于世界观。自然，政治并不就等于文艺，世界观并不就等于创作方法。在封建社会或资本主义社会，一个真正忠实于现实的、有良心、有才能的作家在他的创作中可能突破为他的阶级所限制的世界观，而达到对于现实的真实的描写。但在社会主义社会，或人民民主专政的社会，人民的文艺必须服从人民的政治，革命的现实主义必须服从于革命的、无产阶级的世界观。这是一定不移的道理。
    恩格斯以巴尔扎克为例指示了现实主义能够违反反动世界观而获得胜利，却不是说现实主义甚至能够违反革命的、无产阶级的世界观而获得胜利。今天我们的问题首要的是逐步掌握和巩固这永远不可战胜的革命的、无产阶级的世界观，却不是把现实主义和世界观对立，把现实主义描写成一种可以离开世界观而独往独来的超时代超阶级的法宝，把世界观的重要性降低到可有可无的地位，实际是否定了阶级立场与世界观的重大作用，也就是取消了作为马列主义文艺理论灵魂的文艺的党性的原则。
    劳动人民历来就是历史的创造者，但是迄今以前在文艺上从未反映出他们的这种应得的地位。可是到了今天，中国的劳动人民已经做了国家的主人，今天的问题，并不是工农兵在文艺上的地位已经“超越”或至少相应于他们在历史意义上或政治意义上的地位，而是跟不上和落后于历史意义上和政治意义上的这种地位的时候。封建阶级或资产阶级在他们作为历史舞台上的主角的时候，都要求了并且获得了在文艺上的主角地位，现在劳动人民更加千万倍理直气壮的要求这个地位了，可是这位第一句是马克思，最后一句也是马克思的作者却摇摇头说“不妥当”！同样的，正面人物和反面人物的畸轻畸重，不从个别作品而从整个文艺来说，也是没有疑问的事。这就是必须号召和动员广大文艺工作者们面向新的人民，面向正面人物。说正面人物和反面人物无分彼此，同等重要，那就恰恰等于放弃了对正面人物的深入，也就恰恰违背了历史所交给文艺的主要任务：表现新中国的新的人物。苏联文艺是我们的最好的证例。三十余年来它曾经不断的鞭挞反面人物，可是主要的则是表现“新的苏维埃人”、“社会主义的人”的成长，而获得了无比辉煌的成就。可是这位马恩列斯毛的词句的盗用者却主张不分轻重；在他看来，正面人物反面人物的问题毫无意义，“问题在于立场和态度。”不错，立场和态度非但是个“问题”，而且是个基本问题。可是这位作者的“理论”体系却是这样的：工农兵和其他阶级吗？——在于立场和态度；正面人物和反面人物吗？——在于立场和态度。立场和态度吗？——在于现实主义。现实主义吗？——请看巴尔扎克！一切归结到巴尔扎克，即使我们中国并没有半个巴尔扎克，可是“马列主义”是如此颁定的！——因为，“但是，巴尔扎克却并不由于偏袒没落的贵族和反对新兴的资产阶级之故而对于现实就或多或少地有所歪曲”！“如果一个作家能够忠于现实的话，——那么，比方，即使他原来并没有取得人民的立场，如同巴尔扎克吧，也就意识地或者不意识地能够把现实血肉地反映出来，而流露了它的人民性的一面”！这就是他的中心思想了。也就是他要借用那么多马列主义词句向我们宣讲的东西了。
    那末，谁都明白了吧，引用马克思，是为了证明深入私生活的创作方向；引用毛泽东的“我们的文艺第一是为工农兵”，是为了证明工农兵和其他阶级无分轩轾；引用恩格斯的“现实主义的伟大胜利”，是为了证明现实主义征服世界观或阶级立场；引用列宁论托尔斯泰，是为了证明托尔斯泰的作品的人民性。“关键完全在于忠于现实，把握了现实主义的艺术方法”——至于托尔斯泰的宗教信仰、农业共产主义思想、平民主义的政治思想之类当然完全无关了。诸如此类，这不是对马列主义的最大的歪曲和玷污是什么呢？
    这就是为什么我们针对这篇文章提出严厉批评的缘故。为马列主义学说的纯洁性而斗争，这是一个巨大的长期的工作，特别在理论批评工作比较不开展的文艺战线上更需要我们加紧的努力。
