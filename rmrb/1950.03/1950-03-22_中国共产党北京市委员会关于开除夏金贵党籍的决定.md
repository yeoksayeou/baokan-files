　　Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Xia Jingui from the Party
　　Xia Jingui is a formal member of the Communist Party of China and currently serves as the Head of the Civil Affairs Section of the Eighth District. Since entering the city, he has not sought political progress and has been unable to withstand the influence and temptation of reactionary forces in the city. Not only has he been disloyal to his work responsibilities, but his life has also become increasingly corrupt. He eventually degenerated to the point of associating with drunkards and opium addicts all day long, drinking, smoking opium, and snorting heroin, developing extremely bad habits. He also colluded with opium addicts and drunkards to steal and sell over 600 catties of relief grain, embezzled over 1.3 million yuan of public funds, and used his authority to swindle and deceive people everywhere. Debts and IOUs he incurred that have been verified amount to over 1.2 million yuan. He defrauded the masses of 25,000 yuan in the name of comforting the families of soldiers. He lost a government-issued pistol (whether it was lost or sold is still under investigation). Although the Party had not discovered Xia Jingui's aforementioned serious degenerate, corrupt, and criminal behavior in the past, it had discovered some instances of his irresponsible work and corrupt life. In order to politically save Xia Jingui, the Eighth District Committee repeatedly criticized and educated him. However, Xia Jingui not only showed no remorse but acted duplicitously, becoming increasingly degenerate and corrupt, completely losing the basic conditions and qualities that a Communist Party member and government worker should possess.
　　In order to uphold Party discipline and purify the Party organization, we will never allow such a corrupt and degenerate element to remain in the Party. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to expel Xia Jingui from the Party. His various illegal acts will be handled separately by the government according to the law.
　　March 17th Maintaining the Purity of the Party
　　The expulsion of Xia Jingui, a corrupt and degenerate element, from the Party by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is a necessary measure to maintain the Party's purity and uphold Party discipline. As a Communist Party member, Xia Jingui succumbed to the temptations of reactionary forces after entering the city, even colluding with opium addicts and drunkards to steal and sell relief grain and embezzle public funds. This kind of corrupt and degenerate behavior fully proves that he has completely lost the basic qualities of a Communist Party member.
　　Xia Jingui's corruption and degeneration should serve as a warning to every Communist Party member. According to existing materials, a very small number of Communist Party members have gradually lost their fine qualities of hard work, simplicity, and loyalty to the Party and the people's cause after entering the city. They do not strive for political progress but are deluded by the enjoyment of material life, showing a growing trend towards luxury, corruption, and degeneration. If such people do not promptly warn themselves and overcome bad tendencies, their future development is extremely dangerous, and they may even be lured by reactionary forces. As a result, they will inevitably ruin their reputations and not only destroy themselves but also seriously harm the Party's prestige and the interests of the people's state.
　　Comrade Liu Shaoqi once warned us in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "Special attention should be paid to intensifying one's self-cultivation and maintaining one's pure revolutionary qualities until the very end, even in the victory and success of the revolution, and in the infinite increase of one's own belief and authority, so as not to repeat the same mistakes of degeneration that revolutionary predecessors have made in times of success." Every Communist Party member should constantly use this to warn themselves, and every grassroots organization of the Communist Party should use this to educate its members.

　　中国共产党北京市委员会关于开除夏金贵党籍的决定
    夏金贵系中共正式党员，现任八区民政科长，由于入城后政治上不求进步，经不起城市中反动势力的影响和诱惑，不仅不忠于工作职责，而且生活日趋腐化，最后竟堕落到终日以酒徒烟鬼为友，喝酒、抽大烟、吸白面，染成极恶劣的嗜好。并勾结烟鬼酒徒盗卖救济粮六百余斤，偷盗公款一百三十余万，利用职权到处招摇撞骗，前后借债赊账经查明者已达一百二十余万，以慰劳抗属为名诈取群众二万五千元，丢失公家手枪一只（丢失或出卖尚未查明）。在过去一时期党虽尚未发现夏金贵有上述如此严重堕落腐化犯罪的行为，但已发现其工作不负责及生活腐化的若干行为，八区区委为了从政治上挽救夏金贵，曾再三予以批评和教育，但夏金贵不仅毫无悔改，反而阳奉阴违，日甚一日地堕落腐化下去，完全丧失了一个共产党员和人民政府工作人员应有之起码条件和品质。
    为了严肃党纪，纯洁党的组织，我们绝不容许此类贪污蜕化分子继续留在党内。为此中共北京市委决定开除夏金贵出党。其各项违法行为，请政府另行依法处办。
    三月十七日保持党的纯洁
    中共北京市委开除腐化堕落分子夏金贵的党籍，是保持党的纯洁、严肃党纪的必要措置。夏金贵既为共产党员，入城后经不起反动势力的诱惑，竟至勾结烟徒酒鬼，盗卖救济粮、偷盗公款。这种腐化堕落行为，充分证明他已经完全丧失了一个共产党员的起码条件。
    夏金贵的腐化堕落，是应该引起每一个共产党员的警惕的。据现有材料看来，有极少数共产党员，在入城之后，逐渐失去了艰苦朴素、忠诚于党和人民事业的优良品质，不努力于追求政治上的进步，而迷惑于物质生活的享受，有日渐走向奢侈腐化堕落的趋势。这种人，如不及早警惕自己，克服不良倾向，其发展前途是十分危险的，甚至会受反动势力所引诱。其结果，必致身败名裂，不但断送了个人，并且会严重地危害党的威信和人民国家的利益。
    刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”中曾告诫我们：“要特别注意即使在革命胜利与成功中，在自己的信仰与威权的无限的提高中，来加紧自己的修养，保持自己纯洁的革命的品质以至最后，而不蹈历代革命者在成功时堕落的同一覆辙。”每一个共产党员应该时时以此来警惕自己，每一个共产党的基层组织都应该以此来教育自己的党员。
