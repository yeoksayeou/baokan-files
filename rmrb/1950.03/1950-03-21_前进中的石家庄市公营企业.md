The Advancing State-Owned Enterprises of Shijiazhuang City
	Sun Zhiwei and Jin Ti

	(I) Significant Achievements in Growth and Expansion

	Prior to 1948, Shijiazhuang City was the only industrial city in the North China Liberated Area, with both public and private enterprises showing vigorous growth. With the successive liberation of major cities like Beijing and Tianjin, Shijiazhuang's industry lost this favorable condition. Ordering customers turned to the major cities, and large quantities of inexpensive and high-quality products from Beijing and Tianjin were shipped in for sale, causing some industries (such as cotton weaving and ironworking) to temporarily stagnate and decline. However, this also strongly stimulated enterprise improvement. For example, the paper and some chemical industries began to switch or change production. Many industrial productions had to undergo "economic reorganization" due to old machinery, imperfect equipment, small scale, poor technology, low efficiency, high costs, poor quality, difficult sales, and operational losses.

	Firstly, all units generally attached importance to improving machinery and equipment, and switched from manual production to machine production, laying a solid material foundation for future production improvement. For example, the soap, cigarette, and leather factories under the North China Industrial Company added more than 20 major machines, such as cigarette-making machines and cotton gins. The factories of the Enterprise Company added 37 major machines throughout the year. The Fengxing Cigarette Factory added 14 working machines, such as cigarette-making and tobacco-cutting machines. The Baijiu Factory under the Wine Monopoly Company was reorganized from five branch factories into one main factory for centralized production, equipped with ten modern production equipment such as distiller pots and coolers, putting production on a solid path of development. By the end of 1949, Shijiazhuang City had light and heavy industries including coking, electric lights, telecommunications, tap water, ironworking, wire drawing, matches, pharmaceuticals, flour, cotton weaving, cotton ginning, cigarettes, leather, egg processing, sugar making, soap, glass, winemaking, graphite, soy sauce, ice making, brick kilns, and bedding, excluding the railway system.

	Secondly, thanks to the high labor enthusiasm and active research and creation of all employees, the production level of major factories generally increased by 30% to 40%. For example, the coke oven plant’s efficiency in producing Benzene was: early last year (same below) 118 kilograms per worker, and at the end of the year it was 171 kilograms, an increase of 44.9%; the weaving factory of the Enterprise Company produced 664 bolts of 13-pound white cloth per month at the beginning of the year, and 871 bolts per month at the end of the year, an increase in production level of 22%; the Fengxing Cigarette Factory produced 139.5 boxes of cigarettes per month at the beginning of the year, and 1685.5 boxes per month at the end of the year, an eleven-fold increase. In railway transportation, the vehicle turnaround rate in December last year was shortened by 2.35 days compared to January, an efficiency increase of over 177%; the transportation volume in December increased by 121% compared to January.

	(II) Important Keys to Achieving Success

	1. Two Mass and Conscious Production Emulation Movements

	After the "Preparing for War and Resuming Work, Increasing Production Emulation" in 1948, all employees became closer to the Party. A large number of activists and model workers joined the Party, and cadres further clarified the idea of firmly relying on the working class, uniting closely with the workers, and maintaining the new production level after the emulation. The broad masses of employees had high enthusiasm for studying politics and culture, and researching and improving technology. On this basis, a vigorous "focusing on improving quality, invention and creation, and improving technology" Red May production emulation was launched. At the beginning of the movement, through repeated deliberation and discussion from top to bottom and from bottom to top, combining leadership with the masses, employees themselves formulated collective and individual emulation plans. Factory leaders also proposed different emulation goals and priorities based on the characteristics and different conditions of their respective units, laying the foundation for the victory of the emulation. The Party, government, labor union, and youth league closely combined to form a strong emulation leadership structure. Party and League members played a core role in the emulation. Under the slogan of "Guaranteeing the Completion of Self-Defined Plans," the enthusiasm of all employees remained high. All employees regarded the factory as their home, practicing economy and careful calculation everywhere. Not wasting an inch of yarn or a drop of oil, forming a conscious mass movement. As a result of the emulation, all units completed and exceeded their original production plans. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen units, as many as 145 inventions, creations, and technological improvements were made. The savings value of eleven units totaled more than 710,000 catties of rice, which played a significant role in improving labor efficiency and production levels, and reducing costs.

	From the actual process and gains of the emulation, the stagnant and conservative views that "machines always turn so many turns" and "large telephones cannot produce small telephones" were reversed, which underestimated the emulation and believed that it was impossible to break through the old production levels. For example, the coking plant overcame the historically lower production of by-products in summer. For the Benzene alone, the output increased by 315 kilograms in the first 21 days, which is one of many examples. At the same time, the movement also educated factory cadres to become more familiar with the mass line in leading production, enlightening and concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and relying on the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties in production. For example, at the beginning of the emulation, plans were made through democratic discussion; during the emulation, the masses were mobilized to propose reasonable organization of labor, inventions, creations, production improvements, and valuable opinions such as saving, which made production move forward; after the emulation, a series of work such as democratic awards evaluation were carried out, all of which implemented the working methods of combining leadership with the masses, which is the basic factor for the success of leading production.

	In November, the third production emulation movement was launched, which "rewarded inventions and creations, improved labor organization and production technology, improved product quality, established and improved the production division of responsibility system, and improved the existing level to a higher level." The leadership of this emulation focused on mobilizing employees to use their brains and improve technology. Many factories established technical research associations (or groups) with technical personnel and skilled workers as the core, and employees voluntarily participated in them to study and overcome the difficult problems in the production technology of their units, so that the technical level of employees continued to improve, and inventions and creations appeared from time to time. According to incomplete statistics from ten factories, such as coke oven plant, the output of nineteen major products increased compared with before the emulation, and the quality of eleven products was improved. For example, the matches of the match factory enhanced the moisture resistance, eliminated the explosion phenomenon, and ensured normal combustion. The coke oven plant added steam pipes to the distillation of stinky oil, which improved the quality of asphalt, and the free carbon content was reduced from 15% to 8.1%; the scrap rate of the Transportation Factory was reduced from 39.5% to 15%.

	Significant achievements have also been made in improving labor organization and implementing the division of labor and responsibility system. For example, the Transportation Factory changed the repair of vehicles from a group of three or four people repairing one vehicle to a group of five people repairing two vehicles at the same time, overcoming the waste of manpower and the shortage of technical personnel, which resulted in poor quality. The efficiency was reduced from 380 working hours per vehicle (minimum 320 working hours) to a maximum of 280 working hours (generally 240 working hours). In terms of fixed division of labor and responsibility system, such as casting hooks, the workers' operations were fixed, and they were responsible for mastering the model and injecting the molten liquid, respectively. Due to specialization, the workers' sense of responsibility and technical proficiency have been significantly improved, overcoming impurities and sand hole phenomena, and the efficiency has been reduced from four or five minutes to two minutes to cast one.

	In terms of management, leading cadres and management personnel of various units have strengthened their business studies, improved various inspection and statistical systems, and some units have begun to implement quota management, and at the same time, they have begun to pay attention to cost accounting. Therefore, the third emulation has progressed from simply mobilizing workers to "production emulation" to focusing on improving technology, labor organization, and management at the same time, so that production can continue to improve, and gradually combine with the improvement of management.

	2. Firmly Relying on Employees and Implementing Democratic Management is an Important Guarantee for Overcoming Difficulties and Developing Production

	Since the Red May emulation, the democratic management of various factories has achieved preliminary results. For example, in the dyeing and weaving factory of the Enterprise Company, after the implementation of democratic management, the awareness of the workers has been improved. In order to solve the crisis of high product costs, low quality, and unsalable products, the workers automatically corrected the perfunctory attitude of only pursuing quantity (piece rate wages) and not emphasizing quality. The factory management committee, after democratic discussion, formulated quality standards and reward and punishment systems. As a result, the proportion of first-class cloth increased to more than 99%. At the same time, in order to save factory expenses, the workers voluntarily reduced their wages, reduced unnecessary personnel, consciously saved electricity, reduced material waste, and carefully calculated everywhere. As a result, the factory changed from losing money to making money. However, the democratization of management in some factories has become a formality, which has affected the high level of play of the wisdom of employees. In October, the city launched an in-depth movement to implement democratic management, carried out in-depth communication and mobilization, and the leaders (especially administrative leaders) made sincere and profound self-criticism, which stimulated the enthusiasm of workers to improve management and actively put forward improvement opinions. In addition to the railway system, fourteen units put forward a total of 3,531 improvement opinions, of which 60% were related to production and construction, 23% were related to leadership style, and 15% were related to living welfare, and only 2% were deviated opinions. The leaders accepted and answered these opinions separately, and actively solved them. Therefore, the leadership has been improved, the relationship between the leadership and employees has been closer, and the workers' sense of ownership and production enthusiasm have been improved. On this basis, various democratic organizations and systems have been improved and established, and have become organizations and conventions that everyone consciously supports and abides by, strengthening the responsibility and labor discipline of employees. At the same time, three experiences have been gained in deeply implementing the democratization of management:

	First of all, cadres must profoundly understand the basic spirit and essence of democratic management from an ideological point of view, take the lead in carrying out self-criticism, and establish and promote a democratic style. Only in this way can employees eliminate concerns and put forward suggestions without any restraint. This is the key to carrying out democratic management.

	Secondly, while establishing democratic organizations and systems, it is necessary to implement a democratic style in various daily work, so that democratic management has organization, system, and role, and the three are closely combined, so as not to become a formality.

	Finally, the opinions put forward by employees should be carefully studied, and the correct ones should be adopted and implemented according to their importance and urgency. Incorrect ones should also be patiently explained. This is the basis for concentrating the wisdom of workers and staff, and constantly improving their enthusiasm, responsibility, and consolidating democratic management.

	(III) Several Management Issues at Present:

	1. Quota Management:

	In the past year, although various production management (machine and product inspection, statistics, division of labor and responsible mutual assistance system, etc.) systems have been established and improved successively, and some units have begun to implement quota management, sign contact contracts, and implement a comprehensive responsible system, and have achieved considerable results. However, most enterprises are difficult to deal with wages and reward systems scientifically and rationally due to the lack of in-depth research and scientific analysis in past management, especially because there is no basis for improving production, and they cannot find the key, and they often fall into busy and passive situations. Therefore, the implementation of scientific quota management is the central key to improving enterprise management at present.

	2. Economic Accounting:

	At present, most enterprises have successively established budget and final accounting and cost accounting systems, but because some enterprise leaders do not pay enough attention to mastering cost accounting, and accountants lack the spirit of actively studying, the implementation of economic accounting falls into disorder and formalism in practice and role. Some units have budgets but no final accounts in the implementation of the budget and final accounting system, and the budget has no accurate standards as the basis, and the audit is not strict, resulting in a wide-open and narrow-use (easy to show achievements), and even individual units have the waste of wide-open and wide-use phenomenon. In cost accounting: due to the lack of timely and sound reporting system and strict receipt and issuance system, it is not accurate and timely. Moreover, because the accounting unit is not converted into reality but uses currency as the standard, it loses its role when prices fluctuate, resulting in blind sales and losses. In this way, accounting falls into the passive and passive scope of simple "bookkeeping" and "playing with numbers", and fails to play an active role in analyzing, guiding, and improving production.

	3. Rapid and Universal Improvement of Employees' Technical Level

	In order to overcome the weaknesses of imperfect enterprise equipment, old machines, low efficiency, and poor technology, the Red May emulation movement especially emphasized organizing technical research, improving production tools and production methods, and improving the technical level of employees, which achieved considerable results. However, in the actual process, it is not universal and in-depth enough, and some units have not actively paid attention to these tasks, the enthusiasm of some technical personnel has not been fully utilized, the relationship with workers is not close enough, and conservative views still exist. All of these seriously hinder the rapid and universal improvement of employees' technical level. Therefore, in the future, in addition to continuing to vigorously call and organize employees' technical learning and research, we will advocate respecting teachers and loving apprentices, widely signing apprenticeship contracts, and giving spiritual and material rewards to technical personnel who are enthusiastic about teaching apprentices and actively disseminating technology. At the same time, we will actively unite with and educate and encourage all technical personnel to give full play to their talents and wisdom, actively participate in production and construction, and thoroughly break the old conservative views from an ideological point of view, so that technical personnel and workers can closely integrate and create a upsurge in learning, researching, and improving technology.

　　前进中的石家庄市公营企业
    孙志伟·金替
    （一）成长壮大中的显著收获
    一九四八年以前，石家庄市是华北解放区唯一的工业城市，公私企业均呈现欣欣向荣。京津各大城市相继解放，石市工业便失去了这种优越的条件。订购户纷纷转向各大城市，京津成批物美价廉的产品纷纷运来销售，故部分工业（如棉织、铁业）即暂时表现了停滞和低落。但另方面也有力的刺激了企业的改进，如造纸及部分化学工业开始转业或改产，许多工业生产由于机器旧、设备不完善、规模小、技术差、效率低、成本高、质产不佳、销售困难、经营亏本而不得不实行“经济改组”。
    首先各单位普遍重视改进机具设备，纷纷由手工业生产改用机器生产，对今后提高生产奠定稳固的物质基础。如华北实业公司所属肥皂、烟、皮革厂等计增设卷烟机、轧花机等主要机器二十余部；企业公司各厂全年增设主要机器三十七部；风行烟厂增加卷烟、切烟等工作机十四部。酒业专卖公司所属白酒厂，由五个分厂改建为一个总厂集中生产，具有蒸酒甑、冷却器等十部近代化的生产设备，使生产走上稳固发展的道路。截至一九四九年底，石市工业除铁路系统外，共有炼焦、电灯、电信、自来水、铁工、拔丝、火柴、制药、面粉、棉织、轧花、香烟、皮革、制蛋、制糖、肥皂、玻璃、酿酒、石墨、酱油、制冰、砖窑、被服等轻重工业。
    其次，由于全体职工发挥高度的劳动热忱与积极钻研创造，各主要工厂之生产水平一般均提高百分之三十至四十。如炼焦厂产遍苏油效率：去年（下同）年初每工产一一八公斤，年底则为一七一公斤，提高百分之四四·九；企业公司织布厂，年初月产十三磅白市布六六四匹，年底月产八七一匹，生产水平提高百分之二十二；风行烟厂年初月产烟一三九·五箱，年底月产烟一六八五·五箱，提高十一倍。在铁路运输方面，车辆周转率去年十二月较一月份缩短了二·三五天，效率提高百分之一七七强；运输量则十二月较一月时增加百分之一二一。
    （二）获得成绩的重要关键
    一、两次群众性自觉的生产竞赛运动
    一九四八年“备战复工、增产竞赛”后，全体职工更加靠近了党。大批积极分子、生产模范参加了党，干部也进一步明确了坚决依靠工人阶级的思想、与工人密切团结，保持了竞赛后新的生产水平。广大职工学习政治、文化，研究改进技术的情绪都很高。在此基础上，开展了轰轰烈烈的“着重提高质量，发明创造，改进技术”为目标的红五月生产大竞赛。运动初，由于自上而下、自下而上的反复酝酿讨论，领导与群众相结合，职工自己都订出集体的、个人的竞赛计划，各厂领导上亦依据本单位的特点和不同条件，提出了不同的竞赛目标与重点，给竞赛奠定了胜利的基础。党、政、工、团密切结合，形成有力的竞赛领导机构。党、团员在竞赛中起了核心作用。在“保证完成自订计划”的口号下，全体职工情绪始终高涨。全体职工视工厂如家庭，处处节约，精打细算。不浪费一尺纱、一滴油，形成了自觉的群众运动。竞赛结果，各单位都完成并超过原订生产计划。据十四个单位不完全统计，发明创造，技术改进即达一四五件之多。十一个单位的节约价值共计七十一万斤米以上，对劳动效率及生产水平的提高、成本减低上起了重大作用。
    从竞赛的实际过程与收获中，扭转了“机器总是转那么多转”、“大电话不能生小电话”等轻视竞赛及认为不能突破旧生产水平的固滞、保守观点。如炼焦厂克服了历来夏季副产品减产的规律，仅遍苏油一项，第一阶段二十一日中即增产三一五公斤，这是许多实例之一。同时运动也教育了工厂干部更加熟悉领导生产中的群众路线，启发与集中了群众的智慧，依靠群众力量克服了生产中的困难。如竞赛初，经过民主讨论订计划；竞赛中发动群众提出合理组织劳力、创造发明、改进生产、以及节约等宝贵意见，使生产前进一步；竞赛结束后，又经民主评奖等一系列的工作，都贯彻了领导与群众相结合的工作方法，是领导生产获得成绩的基本因素。
    十一月间，继又开展了“奖励创造发明，改进劳动组织与生产技术，提高产品质量，建立与健全生产分工负责制，将现有的水平再提高一步”的第三次生产竞赛运动。此次竞赛领导上着重发动职工开动脑筋，改进技术。许多厂建立了以技术人员、技术工人为核心，职工自愿参加的技术研究会（或小组），钻研与克服了本单位生产技术上的困难问题，使职工技术水平不断提高，创造发明时有出现。据炼焦等十个厂的不完全统计，十九种主要产品的产量，均比竞赛前提高，有十一种产品提高了质量，如火柴厂的火柴增强了抗潮力，消灭了爆炸现象，保证燃烧正常。炼焦厂臭油蒸馏加用蒸气管，提高了沥青的质量，游离炭质含量由百分之十五减至百分之八·一；交通工厂废活率由百分之三十九·五减为百分之十五。
    在改进劳动组织，实行分工负责制上，亦获显著成绩。如交通工厂修车由三、四人一组修车一部，改为五人一组同时修车二部，克服了浪费人力及技术人员不敷分配因而质量不佳等现象，使效率由每部三八○工时（最低三二○工时），减至最高二八○工时（一般二四○工时）。在固定分工负责制方面，如铸造勾背，将工人操作固定，分别掌握模型、注熔液等。由于专门化，使工人的责任心、技术熟练程度均有显著提高，克服了杂质、砂眼现象，并在效率上由四、五分钟减为二分钟铸一个。
    在管理方面，各单位领导干部及管理人员加强了业务学习，健全了各种检查、统计制度，有些单位并开始实行定额管理，同时对成本核算亦开始重视。因此第三次竞赛是由以往单纯发动工人“生产竞赛”，进展到着重改进技术及劳力组织与改进管理同时并重，以便使生产不断提高，与管理的逐步改进相结合。
    二、坚决依靠职工、实行民主管理，是克服困难发展生产的重要保证
    自红五月竞赛后，各厂的民主管理已收到初步成绩。例如，企业公司染织厂，自实行了民主管理以后，工人觉悟提高。为了解决产品成本高、质量低、没销路的危机，工人自动纠正了只求数量（计件工资）不重质量的敷衍态度，工厂管理委员会又经民主讨论，制订了质量标准与奖惩制度，结果甲等布增到百分之九十九以上。同时，为节省工厂开支，工友们自动降低工资，并减少不必要的人员，自觉地节省用电，减少材料浪费，处处精打细算，因而，使工厂由赔钱走到赚钱。但，有些工厂的管理民主化则流于形式，以致影响了职工智慧高度发挥。十月间，全市又展开了深入贯彻管理民主化运动，进行深入的传达、动员，领导上（尤其是行政领导干部）作了诚恳深刻的自我检讨，激发了工友们改进管理的热情，积极提出改进意见。除铁路系统外，十四个单位共提三五三一条改进意见，其中有关生产建设的占百分之六十，关于领导作风的百分之二十三，生活福利百分之十五，有偏差意见仅占百分之二。领导上对这些意见分别接受、答复，并积极解决。因而，改进了领导，更加密切了领导与职工间的关系，提高了工人的主人翁感觉与生产积极性。在此基础上，健全与建立了各种民主组织与制度，成为大家自觉拥护遵守的组织与公约，加强了职工责任心与劳动纪律。同时并获得了深入贯彻民主管理化的三点经验：
    首先必须使干部从思想上深刻领会民主管理的基本精神与实质，以身作则的展开自我批评，树立与发扬民主作风。职工才能消除顾虑，毫无拘束的提出建议。这是开展民主管理的关键。
    其次，在建立民主组织与制度的同时，必须将民主作风贯彻到日常各种工作里去，使民主管理有组织、有制度、有作用，三者相互紧密结合，才不致流于形式。
    最后，对职工所提意见应认真研究，正确的分别轻重缓急予以采纳实施，不正确的亦应耐心解释说明，这是集中工人职员智慧，不断提高其积极性、责任心、巩固民主管理的基础。
    （三）目前管理上的几个问题：
    一、定额管理：
    一年来，虽先后树立改进了各种生产管理（机器及产品检查、统计、分工负责互助制等）制度，有些单位并已开始实行定额管理，订立联系合同，实行全面负责制，并收到相当成效。但，大部企业单位由于已往管理上缺乏深入研究、及科学的分析，对工资、奖励制度的处理难于科学合理，特别是对改进生产上无所依据，寻不出关键所在，常陷于忙乱被动。因之，实行科学的定额管理，是目前改进企业管理的中心关键。
    二、经济核算：
    目前各企业单位大都先后树立了预决算与成本计算制度，但由于有些企业领导者对掌握成本核算重视不够，以及会计人员缺乏积极钻研的精神，使贯彻经济核算在作法与作用上陷于紊乱与形式主义。有些单位在执行预决算制度上，有预算无决算、预算无精确标准作依据，审核不严格，而产生宽打窄用（易于表现成绩），甚至在个别的产生单位有宽打宽用的浪费现象。在成本计算上：由于没有及时的健全的表报制度与严格的领发制度，以致不精确、不及时。更因计算单位不是折实而是以货币作标准，当物价波动时更失去作用，产生盲目销售亏本现象。这样，使会计陷入消极被动的单纯“记帐”、“弄数字”的范围，未发挥积极分析指导改进生产的作用。
    三、迅速的普遍的提高职工技术水平
    为克服企业设备不完善、机器旧、效率低、技术差的弱点，在红五月竞赛运动中特别强调了组织技术研究，改进生产工具与生产方法，提高职工技术水平，是收到相当成效的。但在实际作的过程中，还不够普遍、深入，有的单位还未积极重视这些工作，某些技术人员的积极性尚未充分发挥，与工友关系还不够密切，仍存在着保守观点。所有这些，就严重的障碍着职工技术水平的迅速与普遍的提高。因此，今后除继续大力号召与组织职工技术学习研究外，提倡尊师爱徒，广泛的签订师徒合同，予热心教徒、积极传播技术的技术人员，以精神的、物质的奖励。同时，主动的团结与教育鼓励所有技术人员，发挥天才智慧，积极参加生产建设，从思想上彻底打破旧的保守观点，使技术人员与工友密切结合，造成学习研究改进技术的热潮。
