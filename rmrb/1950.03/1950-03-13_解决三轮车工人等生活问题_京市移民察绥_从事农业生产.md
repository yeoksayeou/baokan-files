　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to relocate people to the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan before the spring plowing to engage in agricultural production. The first group of more than 480 people departed for Suiyuan on the Jing-Sui Railway at 8:40 PM on the 11th. The purpose of this immigration is mainly to solve the livelihood problems of some tricycle workers, unemployed poor people, intellectuals, and a small number of immigrants from disaster areas. There are currently over 30,000 tricycle workers in Beijing. With the gradual development of various undertakings in the capital, it is necessary to appropriately increase advanced transportation tools such as buses and trolley cars. To this end, the Beijing Municipal People's Government transported a batch of buses from Nanjing last November, but in order to properly take care of the livelihoods of the existing tricycle workers, this batch of buses has not yet been fully used. During this period, the Beijing Municipal People's Government actively prepared for the immigration work in Chahar and Suiyuan to solve the re-employment problem of some tricycle workers. In order to unify the leadership of this work, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Labor Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized an institution last month to be responsible for mobilization, registration, organization, education, and other tasks. In order to make good preparations, the Civil Affairs Bureau sent personnel to Chahar and Suiyuan last month to make relatively detailed and proper regulations with the people's governments of the two provinces regarding transportation, resettlement, and other tasks. Both provinces had already reserved land and prepared houses for this immigration last winter, and will provide loans for food, livestock, and farm tools. The two provinces have also established special institutions to be responsible for receiving and resettling this immigration. It is expected that starting yesterday, an average of 400 people will depart from Beijing every day, striving to complete the transportation before the spring plowing.

　　解决三轮车工人等生活问题
    京市移民察绥  从事农业生产
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府决定于春耕前移民察绥两省，从事农业生产。首批四百八十余人，已于十一日下午八时四十分乘京绥路火车前往绥远。此次移民目的，主要在解决一部分三轮车工人、失业贫民和知识分子以及少数外来灾民的生活问题。京市三轮车工人现有三万余人，随着首都各方面事业的逐步发展，必须适当增加公共汽车、电车等进步交通工具。为此，去年十一月京市人民政府自南京运到公共汽车一批，但是为了适当照顾现有三轮车工人的生活，该批汽车迄未全部使用。在此期间，京市人民政府积极准备了移民察、绥的工作，以便解决部分三轮工人的转业问题。为了统一领导此项工作，已由民政局会同劳动局、市总工会于上月共同组织机构，负责动员、登记、组织、教育等工作。为了做好准备工作，民政局曾于上月派员赴察、绥两省，与各该省人民政府就运送、安置等工作作了比较周密妥善的规定。两省均已于去年冬天为此次移民预先留下了土地，准备了房屋，并将贷给食粮、牲畜和农具。两省并已分别成立专门机构负责接受与安置此次移民。预计自昨日起，今后平均每日将有四百人自京启程，争取于春耕前运送完毕。
