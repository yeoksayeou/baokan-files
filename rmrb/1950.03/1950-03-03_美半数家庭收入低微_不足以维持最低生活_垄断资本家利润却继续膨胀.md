　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 1st: A report from TASS New York indicates that more than half of American families' annual income is insufficient to meet the needs of a minimum standard of living. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, based on a recent survey of living costs in cities across the country, estimates that the annual income required for a family to maintain a very low standard of living is between $3,004 and $3,458 (according to the Heller Committee's statistics, the annual cost for a family of four to maintain a minimum standard of living is no less than $4,000). However, according to a recent report published by the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1948, more than 50% of families in the United States had incomes below this minimum standard. The situation has worsened since 1948. The Census Bureau estimates that over 57% of American families have incomes below $3,500 per year, which is less than the amount considered necessary to maintain a normal family standard of living. Furthermore, the Census Bureau's figures reflect cruel racial discrimination; the average income of Black families is only about half that of White families.

　　On the other hand, the profits of American monopoly capital continue to swell. According to a report from Radiopress New York, the 1949 annual report released by U.S. Steel, one of the largest steel companies in the United States, shows that the company's profits were $166 million, compared to $129.63 million in 1948.

### 美半数家庭收入低微  不足以维持最低生活  垄断资本家利润却继续膨胀

　　美半数家庭收入低微  不足以维持最低生活
    垄断资本家利润却继续膨胀
    【新华社北京一日电】据塔斯社纽约消息：美国人口调查局的报告表明，美国过半数家庭的每年收入，不敷最低生活的需要。美国劳工统计局不久以前根据全国各城市生活费用的调查，估计每个家庭维持极低生活水平的每年收入，须在三千零四美元至三千四百五十八美元之间（按据海勒委员会的统计，四口之家维持最低生活水平的全年费用，非四千美元不可）。但据美国人口调查局最近公布的报告：一九四八年在美国有百分之五十以上的家庭的收入，低于这一最低限度的标准。自一九四八年以来，情形更呈恶化，据人口调查局估计，百分之五十七以上的美国家庭收入，低于每年三千五百元，即低于一个被视为维持普通家庭的生活水平所必需的数目。此外，人口调查局的数字反映了残忍的种族歧视，黑人家庭的收入，平均约仅及白人家庭收入的一半。
    但另一方面，美国垄断资本的利润，则继续膨胀。据电通社纽约讯，美国最大钢铁公司之一——美国钢公司所发表的一九四九年度报告表明：该公司的利润为一亿六千六百万美元，一九四八年的利润为一亿二千九百六十三万美元。
