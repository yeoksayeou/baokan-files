The main slogan for Vietnamese women to commemorate March 8th is to step up preparations for a general counter-offensive. In order to eliminate the French colonial army and defend world peace and democracy, Vietnamese women should actively mobilize all manpower and resources to support the front. The female workers in the Tenth War Zone have decided to work one hour extra per day for a week starting from March 8th, and use the proceeds to comfort the soldiers in the Northwest District. Women in Cao Bang, Bac Kan, Thai Nguyen, and Tuyen Quang provinces have drafted plans to build ten miles of roads in each province within a week. Women in the Seventh War Zone of South Vietnam will increase the sabotage of French transportation and economy throughout the war zone in commemoration of Women's Day.
