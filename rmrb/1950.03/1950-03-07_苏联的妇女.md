Soviet Women
　　Compiled by Ding Jiakang
The great October Socialist Revolution thoroughly smashed all laws that placed women in a subordinate position, oppressing and enslaving them. For thirty-two years, the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist Party's policy on women's issues have further guaranteed the true political and economic equality of Soviet women with men. In the great victory of socialism, Soviet women have made tremendous contributions.

　　　　　In Political and Social Activities
    In the process of socialist construction, hundreds of thousands, even millions, of women have learned to manage public enterprises and the state. This can be clearly seen from the following statistics. In 1922, only five women were elected as members of the Central Executive Committee of the first Congress of Soviets; fifteen years later, in December 1937, two hundred and twenty-seven women were elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; on February 10, 1946, two hundred and seventy-seven of the best daughters of the Soviet people were elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Currently, more than 1,700 women are deputies to the Supreme Soviets of the various Union and Autonomous Republics, and hundreds of thousands of women are deputies to the local Soviet of Workers' Deputies.

    As of February 1948, the number of women elected to Soviet state power organs was as follows:
    Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union... 277 -- 20.7 percent,
    Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics... 1,235 -- 26.5 percent,
    Supreme Soviets of the Autonomous Republics... 503 -- 29 percent.
    Those women who are elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, and the local Soviet of Workers' Deputies are the most outstanding daughters of the Soviet people. Some of them have won the honor of being labor heroes, while others are scholars, great writers, and great artists. Among the politicians of the Soviet state, there are women from all nations of the Soviet Union, with extremely different professions and specialties: workers and farmers, doctors and engineers, teachers and agronomists, scientific, literary, and artistic workers, and Party, political, economic, and social activists.

    In the 1946 elections to the local Soviet of Workers' Deputies in the various Union Republics of the Soviet Union, the number of women elected as deputies was as follows: In the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, a total of 64,897 people were elected to the local Soviets, of which women accounted for 19,379 (29.87 percent); in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, the numbers were 26,652 and 7,995 (30 percent); in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, the numbers were 53,291 and 17,992 (33.81 percent); in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, the numbers were 12,735 and 4,265 (33.49 percent); in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, the numbers were 23,348 and 8,207 (35.15 percent).

    Millions of women participate in the daily work of managing the state, holding various administrative and economic responsibilities in various elected social positions.

    At the same time, Soviet women actively participate in the work of various social organizations. Millions of female workers, staff, and intellectuals are members of trade unions. Hundreds of thousands of women are trade union activists, participating in trade union work from the grassroots organizations – factory committees and local committees – all the way up to the central committees. More than 80,000 women are members of trade union district committees, accounting for 56.3 percent of the total number of members of district committees. There are 450,000 women on factory committees and local committees, accounting for 46.9 percent of all members of factory committees and local committees. There are 350,000 female trade union organizers in various factories, mines, power stations, and Soviet organs, etc. They account for 45.2 percent of the total number of trade union organizers nationwide.

　　　　　In Industrial Construction
    The participation of Soviet women in socialist economic construction is also constantly growing, and the boundaries between "male" and "female" occupations are gradually disappearing. The technological transformation of all sectors of the national economy, the replacement of manual labor with machinery, and the extensive vocational education system – training classes, factory training schools, and experienced producers directly training young cadres next to machine tools – have also promoted the disappearance of this boundary. All of this, combined with the state insurance system for workers and staff, the protection of women's labor, the establishment of sanatoriums and the implementation of free medical treatment, as well as institutions for the protection of mothers and children and public canteens, which are universally established everywhere, has enabled the new masses of Soviet women to enter the ranks of industrial workers.

    The figures showing the growth in the number of women participating in the national economy (excluding collective farms) during the First and Second Five-Year Plans clearly illustrate this point:
    Years                 1929    1930    1931    1932
    Number of Women (in thousands)  3,304   5,877   4,197   6,007
    Percentage (1929 = 100)        100     117.3   127.0   181.8
    Years                 1933    1934    1935    1936    1937
    Number of Women (in thousands)  6,908   7,204   7,964   8,492   9,357
    Percentage (1929 = 100)        209.0   218.0   241.0   257.0   285.2

    Unlike capitalist countries, where most proletarian women engage in poorly paid work or unproductive work as servants, in socialist countries, the number of women participating in large-scale industrial work has grown rapidly. For example, in the nine years from 1929 to 1937, the number of women participating in the national economy increased by 6,053,000, an increase of almost twice the number in 1929, while the number of women in large-scale industry increased almost fourfold: from 880,000 in 1929 to 3,298,000 in 1937.

    The true and equal position of Soviet women in society, like that of men, enables them to quickly master advanced technology and culture in production, widely apply their strength, and give full play to their talents. In all sectors of the Soviet economy, the number of female experts is growing year after year. In 1930, there were 3,600 female experts in industry, while in 1938, there were 140,000 female engineers and technicians working in the Soviet national economy. In seven years, the number of female experts increased 39-fold. The Soviet Communist Party boldly promoted advanced women to positions as enterprise managers, workshop directors, and leaders in other important production departments.

    In the years of several Stalin Five-Year Plans, from 1928 to 1940, the number of female workers and staff increased fourfold. On the eve of the Great Patriotic War, 11 million women participated in work in industry, transportation, and construction, accounting for about 40 percent of the total number of staff.

    There were more than 170,000 female engineers and technicians working in industry.

　　　　　In Agriculture
    Soviet women played an extremely important role in agriculture and in the development of the collective farm system. The collective farm system not only gave peasant women equal rights with men but also provided them with more opportunities to improve culturally, ensuring their active participation in the social life of the Soviet state. The collective farm system selected thousands of outstanding and capable farm women to take on leadership roles. Currently, 250,000 women are directing tractor brigades working on farms. 350,000 women are serving as glorious shock workers in collective farms, engaged in managing farm work. 15,000 women are serving as chairpersons of various collective farms.

    During the Great Patriotic War, Soviet women shouldered the heavy burden of farm work, supplying the front lines with grain and other agricultural products. With tireless work, they overcame the serious consequences caused by the war and the drought of 1946, strengthening and improving the agricultural economy to maintain the eternal abundance of Soviet farmland. In 1946, highly yields were obtained, and twenty-two women were awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor among the forty-nine "pioneers of rural economy."

    Before the Great War, the labor-days of female collective farm members accounted for 38 percent of the labor-days of all collective farm workers, but by 1943, this had increased to 70 percent. In the Gorky Region, female collective farm members not only replaced the male farm members serving in the Red Army but also increased the farm's harvest by one-half. In collective farms across the country, women not only developed productivity but also increased their leadership role. For example, in the non-black soil zone and the northern provinces, the chairpersons of collective farms were women. In the Volga region, the Urals, and Siberia, women held half of the positions of directors and accountants of collective farms, and leaders of crop cultivation groups.

    In 1943, a drought occurred in the New Ushi district, but the female members of the collective farms laboriously overcame these difficulties, harvesting as much as 25 quintals of wheat and 40 quintals of sorghum per hectare.

    In the Dnepropetrovsk farm, most of the members were families of servicemen, and as a result of their diligent efforts, they harvested 6,500 poods of wheat and rye on 65 hectares of land, exceeding the original harvest plan by 330 poods.

    The female members of the various collective farms in the Soviet Union are not only working diligently in the fields; they are also personally operating modern agricultural technology. Eighty out of every hundred tractor drivers are women; sixty out of every hundred combine harvester drivers are women. At the beginning of 1943, a socialist competition was widely launched among female driving shock brigades at machine tractor stations, with each tractor cultivating 1,512 hectares of land, exceeding the original standard by five times.

　　　　　In Science and Culture
    Soviet women have also made enormous contributions to science and culture. Many women have received Stalin Prizes for their outstanding achievements in science, technology, literature, and art. Soviet women are guaranteed the right to a full education under the Constitution, and they have now become a massive cultural force in the Soviet Union.

    Female experts who graduated from higher education institutions account for 44 percent of all experts in the Soviet Union, almost half. Many women are professors at universities. Currently, more than one million women are engaged in medical work in health agencies across the country, and there are 100,000 female doctors. Before the revolution, women accounted for only 4 percent of those engaged in general education. Now, more than 1.3 million women are participating in work in national education, with 760,000 secondary school teachers, and many more women working in various cultural sectors.

    About 35,000 women work in the Soviet Academy of Sciences and research institutes. In recent years, 125 women have earned doctoral degrees in science, and 159 have been awarded Stalin Prizes, including scientists, technicians, writers, female factory workers, and female collective farm members.

    The Soviet Union has 8,000 universities with 670,000 students, of which women accounted for 49.5 percent in the 1939-1940 academic year. In addition, the Soviet Union has more than 500 higher correspondence schools and correspondence departments of ordinary universities, with 850,000 students, of which women also account for a very large proportion.

    In the Soviet Union, not only students can receive education, but housewives also have the same right to education. In recent years, 10,000 wives of Soviet Red Army soldiers have received various special training, 20,000 have entered secondary schools, and 6,000 have entered universities.

　　　　　State Care for Motherhood
    Another great task of Soviet women is to nurture the next generation for the socialist state. Currently, 1.7 million women have received the "Glory of Motherhood" medal, and 18,000 women have been awarded the glorious title of "Mother Heroine." The Soviet government shows great concern for mothers. According to the provisions of the Soviet Constitution, a mother who has six children will receive a state subsidy of 2,000 rubles per year from the day the child is born, and if she has ten children, she will receive a special subsidy of 5,000 rubles. For subsequent births, she will receive 3,000 rubles per year for each birth. In 1947, the Soviet Union allocated 5.9 billion rubles to assist mothers with multiple children and single mothers.

    The Soviet social insurance system for workers and staff stipulates that working women enjoy the same social insurance benefits as men. In some cases, women enjoy special rights.

    Soviet women receive special free medical care during pregnancy and after childbirth. They are given 77 days of leave before and after childbirth, 35 days before childbirth and 42 days after childbirth, with full pay. In the case of twins or abnormal delivery, the postpartum leave can be extended to 56 days.

    A woman working in any agency or enterprise, if she has served for more than three months, can receive a subsidy during pregnancy and maternity leave. Women with a monthly salary of less than 400 rubles can receive an additional subsidy.

    The Soviet government allocates funds from social insurance contributions to set up special rest homes for pregnant women everywhere, so that future mothers can not only get rest but also receive preliminary knowledge about raising children.

    In some cases, women enjoy more rights than men in the subsidies provided by social insurance contributions. In the event of disability caused by work-related injuries or occupational diseases, men and women enjoy equal rights in the issuance of subsidies, regardless of age or length of service. However, in the event of disability caused by other reasons, the payment of subsidies will depend on the age and length of service of the beneficiary. In this regard, the criteria for women are more lenient. For example, men between the ages of 20 and 30 who are disabled due to occupational diseases or reasons other than work must have completed three years of service to receive subsidies, while women of the same age can enjoy the same rights as long as they have worked for two years. Men between the ages of 40 and 50 must have worked continuously for at least 12 years to be eligible for subsidies, while women of the same age can receive subsidies as long as they have worked continuously for nine years. A woman who is 55 years old and has 20 years of work history can receive a pension. Men need to be 60 years old and have worked for at least 25 years to receive a pension. In addition to achieving equal status with men in all civil rights, Soviet women receive appropriate assistance from the state due to their specific physiological conditions.

　　　　　State Facilities for Child Health Care
    In order to reduce the burden on women's work, protect the health of working women, and take care of child health, the Soviet government has widely established institutions such as child consultation centers, women's consultation centers, nurseries, and milk supply stations:

    (1) Child Consultation Centers: The main task is to provide appropriate assistance in preventing and treating diseases for infants aged from newborn to three years old. To guide methods of breastfeeding and caring for healthy babies, to teach common sense of health education, and to send staff to various households to deal with health equipment, especially about infant hygiene. To implement disease prevention work for infants. In addition, the child consultation center also has specialist physicians to treat sick children. At present, almost all children in Soviet cities have received practical help from child consultation centers.

    (2) Women's Consultation Centers: The main purpose is to protect the health of working women, so that they can undertake the great task of being mothers on the one hand, and actively participate in socialist construction on the other. Women's consultation centers provide appropriate guidance at all stages for young women, pregnant women, postpartum women, and older women: 1. Various health-related issues. 2. Announcing the precautions that women should take during pregnancy and childbirth. 3. Providing pregnant and postpartum women with more appropriate living conditions, improving living and working conditions. 4. Developing sanitary cultural education in various enterprises, institutions, and dormitories.

    (3) Milk Supply Stations: To provide milk mixtures, special foods, and vitamins to young children cared for by doctors from consultation centers, to collect surplus breast milk and distribute it to infants who need breast milk.

    (4) Nurseries: When Soviet women are engaged in work in various departments, most of them put their children in nurseries, which cultivate healthy and intelligent future generations with good care, food, and education. There are several types of nurseries:
    1. Urban Nurseries: 1. Dormitory Nurseries, which specifically accommodate children of residents of a certain dormitory or residential area. 2. Nurseries attached to various enterprises and universities (usually accommodating infants under one year old). 3. Local Nurseries, which accommodate children of employees of small enterprises and institutions. 4. Sanatorium Nurseries, located in the suburbs, specifically accommodating frail children who have recovered from tuberculosis or pertussis and other diseases.

    2. Rural Nurseries: 1. Fixed Nurseries, attached to larger collective farms and state farms. 2. Seasonal Nurseries, only open for five to seven months a year. 3. Mobile Field Nurseries, temporary organizations during rural sowing or harvesting periods.

    Nurseries aim to help working women raise children from one month to three years old. Infants under one year old are sent to nurseries at their mother's workplace, while infants over one year old are sent to nurseries in their residential area. Before the war, there were 31,135 nurseries nationwide in the Soviet Union, with 854,000 spaces. 143,500 seasonal nurseries were also established in collective farms, with 405,500 spaces. According to the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan, the number of spaces in fixed nurseries will be increased to 1,251,000.

    The organization of Soviet nurseries enables millions of women to fulfill their maternal obligations while also engaging in beneficial social labor, to focus on studying and working seriously, and not to lag behind men in terms of labor or study.

    In order to strengthen the health of children, the Soviet government organizes summer camps every year to take children to the countryside, and sick children are sent to children's sanatoriums for rest or treatment.

    In 1943, more than 1.5 million children rested in summer camps and health centers, while in 1945, health organizations accommodated 3 million children, of which 170,000 were children aged three to four from nurseries. Tens of thousands of children from all over the country rushed to the famous "Artek" children's camp located on the Black Sea coast for rest.

　　　　　Training of Mother and Child Health Care Cadres
    According to the 1946 plan of the Soviet Ministry of Finance, the expenditure paid on the Soviet health care business alone reached 3 billion rubles, and the funds for training mother and child health care workers were not included.

    The so-called mother and child health care cadres are staff members who serve for the health care of mothers and children. The Soviet government attaches great importance to the training of this group of cadres. Now, each Union Republic Ministry has established schools for training mother and child protection workers. In 1939, the Russian Socialist Federal Republic alone had trained 21,230 midwifery doctors and 17,520 nurses. This does not include the staff of collective farms and state farm nurseries. From 1930 to 1937, special schools were established in Moscow, Leningrad, Rostov, and other places to train pediatricians. At present, there are 19 medical universities in various republics specializing in the training of pediatricians.

    In addition, the Soviet Union has established scientific research institutes to study the health problems of protecting mothers and children, paying special attention to reducing the morbidity and mortality rates of mothers and children, as well as the most effective methods of mother and child health care. As early as 1922, the Mother and Child Protection Research Department was first established in Moscow, followed by Leningrad and other cities. At present, 23 scientific research institutes for mother and child protection have been established, and magazines on mother and child protection issues are regularly published.

    The People's Committee for Health of the Soviet Union is responsible for leading this work, with mother and child protection branches set up in various federal regions, supervised and led by specialized personnel, and guided by the pediatric medical research group of the scientific research institute.

    Under the constant care of the government and the Communist Party, Soviet women are living a happy life.

　　苏联的妇女
    丁家康编
    伟大的十月社会主义革命彻底粉碎了使妇女处于隶属地位，使她们受尽压迫和奴役的一切法律。三十二年来，苏联社会主义建设的胜利，苏联共产党对妇女问题的政策，更保证了苏联妇女与男子的真正的政治的和经济的平等地位。在社会主义的伟大胜利中，苏联妇女有着巨大的功绩。
            在政治和社会活动方面
    在社会主义建设过程中，数十万乃至数百万妇女学会了管理公共企业，学会了管理国家。这由下列统计数字上，便可以明白地看出来。一九二二年，第一届苏维埃代表大会选举出来的中央执行委员会委员中，只有五个妇女；过了十五年，在一九三七年十二月，有二二七个妇女当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表；一九四六年二月十日，有二七七个苏联人民最优秀的女儿当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。现时有一、七○○个以上的妇女是各个加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃的代表，有几十万妇女是地方劳动者代表苏维埃的代表。
    到一九四八年二月，选入苏联国家政权机关中的妇女如下：
    苏联最高苏维埃……二七七——百分之二○·七，
    加盟共和国最高苏维埃……一、二三五——百分之二六·五，
    自治共和国最高苏维埃……五○三——百分之二九。
    妇女当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表、加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃代表以及地方劳动者代表苏维埃代表的，都是苏联人民最优秀的女儿。其中的一些曾赢得了劳动能手的荣誉，另一些是学者、大文学家和大艺术家。在苏维埃国家的政治家中，有苏联一切民族的妇女，她们有极不相同的职业和专门业务：工人和农民，医生和工程师，教员和农艺家，科学、文学和艺术工作者，党的、政治的、经济的和社会的活动家。
    一九四六年苏联各盟员共和国地方劳动者代表苏维埃选举时，妇女当选为代表的数字如下：在白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国，被选入地方苏维埃的总共有六四、八九七人，其中妇女占一九、三七九人（百分之二九·八七）；在格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国，是二六、六五二人，其中妇女占七、九九五人（百分之三十）；在卡查赫苏维埃社会主义共和国，是五三、二九一人，其中妇女占一七、九九二人（百分之三三·八一）；在基尔吉兹苏维埃社会主义共和国，是一二、七三五人，其中妇女占四、二六五人（百分之三三·四九）；在阿捷尔拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国，是二三、三四八人，其中妇女占八、二○七人（百分之三五·一五）。
    几百万妇女在各种选举出来的社会岗位上、担负着各种行政的和经济的职责，参加管理国家的日常工作。
    同时苏联妇女还非常积极地参加各种社会组织的工作。千百万的女工、职员、智力劳动者都是职工会的会员。有几十万妇女是职工会的活动分子，参加职工会的工作——从基层组织——工厂委员会和地方委员会起直到中央委员会为止。职工会区委员会委员中，有八万以上的妇女，占区委员会委员总数的百分之五六·三。工厂委员会和地方委员会委员中，有四十五万是妇女，占工厂委员会和地方委员会全体委员的百分之四六·九。各个工厂、矿山、发电站以及苏维埃机关等等里面的工会组织者，有三十五万是妇女。她们占全国职工会组织者总数的百分之四五·二。
            在工业建设方面
    苏联妇女之参加社会主义经济建设，也不断地增长着，“男”“女”职业间的界线便逐渐泯灭了。国民经济所有各个部门的技术改造，机械之替代手工劳动，广泛的职业教育系统——训练班、工厂训练学校、有经验的生产者直接在机床旁之训练年青干部，也促进了这一界线的泯灭。所有这一切配合着为工人、职员举办国家保险事业，对妇女劳动之保护，设备疗养所及实行免费医药治疗，以及保护母亲、幼儿之机关和公共食堂，在各地普遍设立，便使新的苏联妇女群众，能够走进产业工人的队伍。
    在第一、第二个五年计划的年代，参加国民经济工作（除集体农庄以外）的妇女，其数量增长之数目字，明显地说明了这一点：
    年代                     一九二九      一九三○     一九三一     一九三二
    妇女数量（以千为单位）   三、三○四    五、八七七   四、一九七  六、○○七
    百分比（一九二九年为一百）１００       一一七·三   一二七·○   一八一·八
    年代                     一九三三      一九三四     一九三五     一九三六   一九三七
    妇女数量（以千为单位）   六、九○八    七、二○四   七、九六四   八、四九二 九、三五七
    百分比（一九二九年为一百） 二○九·○  二一八·○   二四一·○   二五七·○ 二八五·二
    与资本主义各国不同，在那里大部分无产阶级妇女从事报酬菲薄的工作，或是仆役的不生产的工作，在社会主义国家里，妇女参加大工业工作的数量，则有了迅速的增长。例如，在九年内，即自一九二九年到一九三七年，参加国民经济工作的妇女数量已增加了六百零五万三千人，即增加了差不多等于一九二九年的两倍，而在大工业中妇女数量则差不多增长了四倍：在一九二九年为八十八万，而在一九三七年则已增加到三百二十九万八千了。
    苏联妇女在社会中的真正和男子平等的地位，使得她们也能在生产中迅速掌握先进的技术文化，广泛地应用自己的力量和发挥自己的天才。在苏维埃经济所有各个部门中，女专家的数量，年复一年地增长起来了。一九三○年在工业中，有三千六百名女专家，而一九三八年在苏联国民经济中工作的女工程师和女技师，已有十四万人了。在七年内女专家的数量增长了三十九倍。苏联共产党大胆地把先进的妇女，提拔到企业经理、车间主任以及其他重要生产部门的领导者的职位上来。
    在几个斯大林五年计划的年份内，即自一九二八年到一九四○年，女工和女职员的数量增长了四倍。在卫国战争前夕，工业中，运输业中以及建筑业中，有一千一百万妇女参加了工作，即占全体工作人员总数的百分之四十左右。
    在工业中工作的女工程师和女技师，一共有十七万人以上。
            在农业方面
    苏联妇女，在农业方面，在集体农场制度的发展方面，起了极重要的作用。集体农场制度，不仅给予农妇与男子平等的权利，而且供给他们更多的机会在文化方面求进步，保证她们积极参加苏维埃国家的社会生活。集体农场制度，选拔了数千优秀的而有能力的农场妇女担任领导工作。现在有二十五万妇女正指挥着曳引机突击队在农场中工作。三十五万妇女在集体农场中担任光荣的突击队员，从事管理农场的工作。担任各集体农场主席之职的，达一万五千人。
    在伟大的卫国战争时期，苏联妇女肩负着农场工作的重荷，以谷物和其他农业产品供应前方的需要，曾以始终不倦的工作，克服了由于战争由于一九四六年的旱灾而引起的严重的后果，加强提高农业经济，来保持苏联农田的永远丰收。一九四六年获得了高度的收获量，四十九个“农村经济先驱者”中，有二十二位妇女，荣膺社会主义劳动英雄的奖状。
    大战以前，集体农场女场员的劳动日占所有集体农场工作者的劳动日百分之三八，到了一九四三年，却要占百分之七○。在高尔基区集体农场女场员不仅代替了服役红军的男场员工作，而且使农场的收获提高了二分之一。在全国集体农场中，妇女不仅发展了生产力而且增加了领导作用。例如，在非黑土带区和北方诸省集体农场主席就是由妇女担任的。在伏尔加区，乌拉尔和西伯利亚地区，集体农场的主任和会计，植物栽培组的领导干部，半数由妇女担任。
    一九四三年新乌士区发生旱灾，集体农场的女场员们艰苦地克服了这些困难，在每俄亩竟收获了二十五公担小麦和四十公担高粱。
    在第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克农场，大部分场员是出征军人家属，她们勤奋努力的结果，在六十五俄亩土地上，收获了六千五百普特小麦、裸麦，超过原收获计划三百三十普特。
    苏联各集体农场的女场员，不但在田地里勤劳工作，她们也亲手支配着现代的农业技术，每一百个耕种机驾驶员中有八十个妇女；每百个收割两用机驾驶员中有六十个是妇女。一九四三年初，广泛地展开了机器耕种机站女驾驶突击队社会主义竞赛，每部耕种机耕种了一、五一二俄亩土地，比原来标准超过了五倍。
            在科学与文化方面
    苏联妇女，对于科学与文化，也同样有极大的贡献，许多妇女由于自己在科学、技术、文学和艺术方面卓越的成就，而获得了斯大林奖金。苏联妇女依据宪法享有受完全教育的权利，现在她们已成为苏联的一支巨大的文化力量。
    在高等学校毕业的女专家占全苏联专家之百分之四十四，几乎是一半。很多妇女在大学里担任教授。现在在全国各卫生机关从事医务工作的妇女在百万以上，有十万个女医生。革命前从事普通教育工作的妇女，仅占百分之四。而现在国民教育方面，已有一百三十余万妇女参加工作，中等学校教师达七十六万人，另外还有更多的妇女在各文化部门工作。
    在苏联研究院和实验所担任工作的妇女，约三万五千人。最近几年内，有一百二十五人妇女考得科学博士学位，一百五十九人获得斯大林奖金，其中包括科学家、技师、文学家及工厂女工和集体农场的农妇。
    苏联有八千所大学，有六十七万大学生，其中女生数目，在一九三九至一九四○年一学年占百分之四九·五。此外，苏联还有五百余高等函授学校和普通大学的函授科，有八十五万大学生，其中女生亦占极大的比例数。
    在苏联不仅是学生可以受到教育，就是家庭妇女也有同样受教育的权利。最近几年来，苏联红军的妻子已有一万人受了各种特殊的训练，两万人进入中学，六千人进入大学。
            国家对母性的关心
    苏联妇女的另一伟大的任务，就是为社会主义的国家，养育下一代。现在有一百七十万妇女已经得到“母性之光”的勋章，一万八千名妇女，荣膺“母亲英雄”的光荣称谓。苏联政府对于母亲们表示极大的关切，依照苏联宪法的规定，有了六个孩子的母亲，以后若再生产，以孩子出生那天起，由国家补助每年二千卢布，有十个孩子的，给五千卢布的特别补助金，以后再生产，按生产数目每年给三千卢布，一九四七年苏联曾指拨五十九亿卢布来辅助多子女的母亲和独身的母亲。
    苏联的工人与职员的社会保险制度，规定劳动妇女与男子享受同等的社会保险的利益。在有些时候，妇女享有特别的权利。
    苏联妇女在怀孕期间和产后，可以获得特别免费医疗。在生产前后给假七十七天，产前三十五天，产后四十二天，薪支照付。如果是孪生或是不正常的分娩，产后假期可延长到五十六天。
    在任何一个机关或企业中工作的妇女，如果任期在三个月以上，在孕期和生产期内可以获得津贴，月薪不满四百卢布的妇女，可以获得额外的津贴。
    苏联政府在社会保险费中拨付款项为怀孕妇女在各处设置特别休息所，使未来的母亲们不仅可以获得休息，而且可以受到关于养育儿童的初步知识。
    在社会保险费中所给与的恤金，在某些情形，妇女享有较男子为多的权利。由于工作而受伤或者由于职业疾病所造成的残废，在发给恤金时，男子和妇女享受同等的权利，不受年龄或服务年限的限制。但是由于其他的原因而造成残废，恤金的付给便要依照受恤者的年龄和工作期限的长短而定。在这一点上，对于妇女的所限制的尺度是比较宽的，例如，从二十岁到三十岁之间的男子，由于在职业疾病和在工作时以外的原因所造成的残废，必须在工作期限满三年时，才能领受恤金，而同年龄的妇女，只要工作两年，便可以享受同样的权利。四十岁至五十岁的男子，至少曾继续工作十二年，才有领恤金的资格，而同年龄的妇女，只要曾继续工作九年，便可领到恤金。年届五十五岁的妇女，如果有二十年的工作历史，可以领到养老金。男子则需要年届六十，而且至少曾工作二十五年，才可以领养老金。苏联妇女除在一切公民权利上与男子取得平等的地位外，并获得国家因生理的具体情况所给予的适当帮助。
            国家关于儿童保健的设施
    苏联政府为减轻妇女在工作中的负担，保护劳动妇女的康健及照顾到儿童的保健工作，广泛地设立儿童顾问所、妇女顾问所、托儿所、乳汁供给所等机构：
    （一）儿童顾问所  主要的任务是给予初生至三岁的婴孩预防和医治疾病的适当帮助的工作。指导哺育及看护康健婴儿的方法，讲授卫生教育的常识，派工作人员到各家庭中处理卫生设备，尤其是关于婴儿的卫生。对婴孩施行预防疾病的工作。此外，儿童顾问所并有专门医师，为患病儿童医治。目前，苏联各城市中，差不多所有的儿童，都获得了儿童顾问所的实际的帮助。
    （二）妇女顾问所  主要的目的是保护劳动妇女的健康，使她们一方面所担负起作母亲的伟大任务，一方面能积极地参加社会主义建设工作。妇女顾问所为青年妇女、孕妇、产妇，及老年妇女以各时期的适当指导工作：一、有关健康的各项问题。二、预告妇女在妊娠和分娩时期应有的防备。三、给予孕妇及产妇比较适当的生活条件，改善生活及劳动条件。四、在各企业机关及宿舍中展开卫生文化教育。
    （三）乳汁供给所  供给由顾问所医生指定的照看的幼儿以乳汁混合物、特种食品及维他命，征集多余的人奶分配给需要母乳的婴孩。
    （四）托儿所  苏联妇女在从事各部门的工作时，大部分把子女放在托儿所里，托儿所以良好的看护、食物和教育来培养健康而智慧的后代。托儿所的形式有下列几种：
    一、城市托儿所：１、宿舍托儿所，专收容某一寄宿舍或住宅区居民的儿童。２、各企业和各大学附设的托儿所（通常收容一岁以下的婴孩）。３、地方托儿所，收容小的企业机关供职者的子女。４、疗养托儿所，设在郊外，专收容体质孱弱的、曾患结核或百日咳等症愈后的孩童。
    二、乡村托儿所：１、固定托儿所，附设在规模较大的集体农场和国营农场中。２、季节托儿所，一年内仅开办五个月至七个月。３、野外流动托儿所，在农村播种或收割期间临时性的组织。
    托儿所以帮助职业妇女教养一个月至三岁的儿童为原则。不满一岁的婴儿送入母亲工作地点的托儿所，而一年以上的婴儿送入居住地点的托儿所。战前苏联全国有三一、一三五个托儿所，八五四、○○○个额位。在集体农场中也建立了一四三、五○○个季节托儿所，计有四○五、五○○额位。依照苏联新五年计划规定，固定性托儿所的额位，将增至一、二五一、○○○之数。
    苏联的托儿所的组织，使千百万妇女能够执行母性的义务而同时也进行有益的社会劳动，能够专心学习，严肃地工作，不论在劳动方面，或学习方面都不落后于男子。
    苏联政府为加强儿童的康健，每年夏天全国都组织少年营，把儿童们带到野外去，病弱的儿童则送到儿童疗养院去休息或治疗。
    一九四三年在少年营和保健所内休息的儿童计一百五十余万名，而在一九四五年，保健机关所容纳的儿童已达三百万人，其中有十七万名是托儿所中的三岁至四岁的儿童。有好几万儿童从全国各地赶到著名的，位于黑海沿岸的“阿尔铁克”少年营来休息。
            母性和孩子保健工作干部的培养
    根据苏联财政部一九四六年的计划，单在苏联保健事业上所支付的费用达卅亿卢布，对于培养母子保健工作干部的经费尚未包括在内。
    所谓母性及孩子保健干部，是为母亲及子女的保健工作而服务的工作人员。苏联政府对于培养这批干部是非常重视的。现在每一加盟共和国部设立有训练母子保护工作人员的学校。一九三九年仅俄罗斯社会主义联邦共和国，已训练了二一、二三○个助产医生和一万七千五百二十个看护。这尚未包括集体农场和国营农场托儿所的工作人员。一九三○——三七年为训练小儿科医生，在莫斯科、列宁格勒、罗斯托夫等地，特别创立专门学校。目前在各共和国有十九所医科大学，专门训练小儿科医师。
    另外，苏联并设立科学研究所，研究保护母子的健康问题，特别注意减低母子的患病率及死亡率的问题，以及母子保健的最有效的方法。远在一九二二年，莫斯科就首先成立了母子保护研究部，接着列宁格勒以及其他城市已都设立起来，目前母子保护科学研究所已成立二十三所，并经常出版有关母子保护问题的杂志。
    苏联保健人民委员会负责领导这一工作，在联邦各区设有母子保护分部，由专门负责人员监督和领导，并由科学研究所小儿科医学研究组给予指导。
    苏联妇女在政府和共产党的不断的关切下，度着幸福的生活。
