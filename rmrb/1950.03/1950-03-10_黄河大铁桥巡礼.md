　　A Pilgrimage to the Yellow River Iron Bridge
　　By our reporter Chen Ji
　　The Long-Neglected Yellow River Bridge
　　Traveling twenty-five kilometers north by train from Zhengzhou, you arrive at the south bank station of the Yellow River. Here, you can see the surging Yellow River, its waters seemingly "coming from the sky," and the grand iron bridge spanning the north and south. Construction on this bridge began in 1900 and was completed in 1905. The warranty period was fifteen years. The bridge is three kilometers long, a world-renowned long bridge with one hundred and two arches. During the warlord era, two arches on the north bank were destroyed, leaving the bridge with only one hundred arches. The bridge structure is divided into two types: at both ends, where the river is deeper, thirty-meter-long steel truss beams are used; the middle section uses twenty-meter-long steel plate beams. The piers are constructed of spiral steel columns, with a column diameter of thirty-five centimeters and a spiral diameter of one point two zero meters at the base. During the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, forty-five arches of the steel beams at the southern end were dismantled and transported to the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway; the remaining arches were left to be dismantled at will and were subjected to multiple bombings, damaging some of the piers. The Japanese invaders occupied the bridge and repaired it with military beams to restore traffic. After the Kuomintang reactionary government took over the bridge, they never maintained it, allowing it to deteriorate. As a result, the bridge foundation, piers, beams, and deck are riddled with defects and injuries. After the bridge was liberated last year, large-scale warfare was underway, and the main railway lines were in urgent need of repair, so the leadership was temporarily unable to attend to the maintenance of the Yellow River Iron Bridge. Moreover, the workers managing the bridge and the old engineering technicians believed that the iron bridge had exceeded its warranty period by thirty years, and that it was long unusable and that maintaining it was a waste of effort. Therefore, no one carefully studied the changes in the bridge foundation, piers, and water flow; and no one tested the stress and deflection of the beams. The steel rails on the bridge deck were disorganized, and the sleepers were rotten and warped. Before the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau carried out preliminary reinforcement work last December, the bridge had remained in a dilapidated state for many years.
　　Breaking Down Conservatism
　　During the warlord era, because the Yellow River Bridge had exceeded its warranty period, it was restricted to a slow speed of five kilometers per hour. When trains crossed the bridge, they had to be transported in two stages using small locomotives, which took three hours, greatly affecting north-south traffic. At the end of last year, as the Beijing-Hankou Railway was about to be repaired and opened to traffic, in order to ensure traffic safety, the Ministry of Railways organized a bridge inspection team, including Soviet experts, to conduct an on-site inspection of the bridge. After detailed inspection and research, the Soviet experts discovered various defects in the bridge, but believed that with reinforcement and careful maintenance, the iron bridge could still be used. At the time, some engineers did not fully agree with this view. The Soviet experts also tested the steel materials and determined that the steel quality was very good. At the same time, the results of calculating the bridge's stress showed that the weakest part, the Japanese military beams, could withstand a locomotive load of approximately Cooper's E30 rating, and the transverse beams of the lower truss beams could withstand a locomotive load of approximately Cooper's E24 rating. Therefore, it was confirmed that the Yellow River Iron Bridge could not only continue to be used, but also, after reinforcement, could increase its load-bearing capacity and increase the speed of traffic. Based on this practical and scientific testing and calculation, the Ministry of Railways formulated a preliminary reinforcement plan, and on December 21st of last year ordered the Zhengzhou Railway Administration to complete this reinforcement plan. After receiving the order, the Zhengzhou Bureau started construction on December 27th, and in nine days, by January 4th of this year, completed the work of placing rubble to protect the bridge piers, re-riveting the lower transverse beams, adding temporary scaffolding, tidying up the bridge deck, and replacing steel rails. At that time, the Ministry of Railways sent people to test the train three times: the first time, two 2-6-2 small locomotives were coupled in multiple units, with two empty cars isolated, crossing the bridge, taking twelve and a half minutes, equivalent to a speed of fifteen kilometers per hour; the second time, two locomotives were coupled in multiple units, without isolating empty cars, taking nine and a half minutes, equivalent to a speed of slightly less than twenty kilometers per hour; the last time, two locomotives were coupled in multiple units, pulling one thousand two hundred and seventy tons, crossing the bridge in thirteen minutes, equivalent to a speed of slightly less than fifteen kilometers per hour, and the bridge showed no abnormalities. In this way, trains only needed twenty-two minutes to travel from the north bank of the Yellow River to the south bank, improving efficiency by seven or eight times compared to the past three hours. This experiment powerfully overturned the previous regulation of slow travel at five kilometers per hour for decades, broke the technical conservatism of the past, and proved that the method of improving and reinforcing the bridge was correct. In order to further strengthen the Yellow River Iron Bridge, the Ministry of Railways has decided to design a comprehensive reinforcement project, and in February of this year, a bridge maintenance section was established at the Yellow River Iron Bridge, responsible for the improvement, reinforcement, and maintenance of the bridge.
　　The Rebirth of the Yellow River Bridge
　　When the reporter visited the bridge, the workers of the bridge maintenance section were working intensely. They had used the Spring Festival holiday to completely lay the guard rails, preventing the unfortunate accident of wheels derailing. They wove four hundred and forty-three wire cages, with one hundred and sixty-one wire cages netting the rubble around the bridge piles, preventing rapid currents from washing away the rubble and damaging the bridge piers. They continuously dumped more than a thousand cubic meters of rubble to protect the bridge piles. They corrected the deflection of the bridge beams, replaced uneven steel rails, cleared accumulated grass from the bridge piers, and consolidated the embankments at both ends. Now the bridge workers are replacing large quantities of new sleepers, and are constantly paying attention to loose screws and protruding spikes. Near each pier, one or two people are stationed to regularly inspect the steel beams to prevent problems. The bridge maintenance section is also preparing to implement new types of road maintenance and bridge protection methods, and has established an inspection team and plans to implement a repair team to implement a responsibility system. The workers said, "Our eyes are constantly watching the bridge, and our hands are always maintaining the bridge; the bridge is our home, our property, and we will never be as indifferent to it as we were in the past." When the reporter saw trains speeding across the bridge in fifteen minutes, the workers guarding the bridge deck carefully checked the condition of the bridge rails. When locomotives were preparing to cross the bridge, the workers lay under the locomotives and carefully inspected the locomotive parts. Yu Baoting, the chairman of the bridge maintenance section's trade union, said that they had been working here for forty years and had never had such a good work attitude as they do today. Recently, the Zhengzhou Bureau discussed strengthening the work on the Yellow River Bridge and decided on a repair plan. Preparations are being made to cooperate with the reinforcement plan that the Ministry of Railways is about to draw up, to strengthen individual military beams and replace abnormal members. In order to avoid the shaking of trains, bolts will be added between the rows of military beams to make it a whole. In order to prevent floods, preparations are being made to store ten thousand cubic feet of rubble to protect the bridge foundation during major floods, and to throw four thousand cubic feet of rubble on both ends of the bridge to protect the embankments. In addition, the steel beams will be painted, the truss beams will be repaired, and the lifespan of the bridge will be extended. Based on this repair plan, the Yellow River Bridge Maintenance Section is organizing its forces to start work within days. In this way, the Yellow River Iron Bridge will become more solid, increase its load-bearing capacity, and improve transportation efficiency.
　　Current Problems
　　While visiting the Yellow River Iron Bridge, the reporter also interviewed several engineers. Wu Shi'en, the director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, who is also a chief engineer, believes that there is no problem with trains running like this today after the Yellow River Iron Bridge has been reinforced. Engineer Wang Du feels that the bridge deck and beams can still be used, but the bridge piers are not solid enough. There are no bridge piers, only spiral steel columns supporting the bridge beams, so he said that the fundamental solution is to strengthen the bridge piers. Director Wu Shi'en also has this view. However, they all agreed that as long as we pay attention to maintenance at all times and constantly reinforce it, there is no big problem with the Yellow River Iron Bridge being used for another eight or nine years.
　　When the reporter talked to the workers about their recent work, they raised the following issues: (1) They hope that the Ministry of Railways will quickly formulate a reinforcement plan so that the reinforcement work can be completed before the flood season; (2) The repair work plan is not thorough enough, and sudden, rushed tasks are suddenly arranged, causing employees to be busy with rushing, and routine work cannot be coordinated with rushing work; (3) The supply of materials is not timely, and the work of the Yellow River Bridge has not been completely placed in the most important position; (4) When trains cross the bridge, changing to small locomotives often affects the crossing time due to the slow allocation of locomotives. Some employees are still skeptical about whether the Yellow River Bridge can continue to be used. They feel, "For decades, we have never traveled at a speed of fifteen kilometers per hour; today the bridge is older, why do we have to increase the speed of traffic?" This kind of speculation without scientific basis has not been clarified. The local trade union has not told the employees in detail about the situation and results of the Ministry of Railways' inspection and testing of the bridge, which will affect the further reinforcement work of the Yellow River Bridge. Zhang Mingji, the head of the bridge maintenance section, told the reporter that most of the employees in the section are in their forties and fifties, and there are not many young and strong people. Tang Yingguan, the director of the bridge maintenance office, who has been working on the bridge for many years, is a non-technical person. He said that when he was responsible for leading the work on the bridge, he encountered many technical problems that could not be solved well. Due to the lack of technical personnel on the bridge and the fact that engineers do not often come to the site, these technical tasks are often delayed for a long time, affecting the work on the iron bridge. These phenomena urgently need to be resolved today and cannot be allowed to continue to exist.

　　黄河大铁桥巡礼
    本报记者  陈迹
    年久失修的黄河桥
    乘火车从郑州北行二十五公里，即到达黄河南岸车站。在这里，就可以看见水从“天上来”的滚滚黄河，和横跨黄河南北的大铁桥。这座桥从一九○○年开始修建，至一九○五年完成。保固期限为十五年。该桥长三公里，是闻名世界的长桥，有桥孔一百零二个。军阀混战时代，北岸两个桥孔被毁，全桥现仅一百孔。桥梁分两种：两端因河水较深，采用三十公尺长的钢桁梁；中部则用二十公尺长的钢板梁。桥墩为螺旋形钢柱所构成，钢柱直径为三十五公分，柱底之螺旋直径为一点二零公尺。抗日战争初期，南端的钢梁曾被拆卸四十五孔，运至湘桂黔铁路；其余各孔任人拆卸，并遭多次轰炸，有的桥墩亦被损坏。日寇侵占该桥，曾以军用梁修复通车。国民党反动政府接收该桥后，从未加以养护，任其损害。因之桥基、桥脚、桥梁和桥面，遍是缺陷和创伤。去年该桥获得解放后，因战争正在大规模进行，各铁路干线极待修复，对黄河铁桥的养护工作，领导上一时无法顾到。而管理该桥的职工和旧的工程技术人员都认为这座铁桥已经超过保固期限三十年之久，早就不能使用了，养护它只是白费力量。因此，桥基、桥脚和水流的变化情况，没有人精心研究；桥梁应力和挠度，也没人去试验。桥面上的钢轨杂乱无章，枕木腐朽歪斜。在去年十二月郑州路局实行初步加固工作以前，该桥一直保持着多少年来的破烂状态。
            打破了保守主义
    军阀战争时代，黄河桥因超过保固年限，改为时速五公里徐行。列车过桥时，要用小型机车分两次运送，需时三小时，影响南北交通极大。去年底京汉路快要修复通车时，为保证行车安全，铁道部组织了包括苏联专家在内的桥梁视察团到现场勘察该桥，经过详细检查研究，苏联专家发现了该桥各种缺陷，但认为经过加固，随时注意养护，这座铁桥仍然可以继续使用。当时，有些工程师对于这个看法，并不完全同意。苏联专家又将钢料加以试验，判定钢质很好。同时，计算桥梁应力的结果，认为最弱的部分日本军用梁可承受约相当于古柏氏三十级的机车荷重，下承桁梁的横梁可承受约相当于古柏氏二十四级的机车荷重，因此肯定黄河铁桥不仅能够继续使用，而且在加固以后，可以增加载重力，提高行车速度。根据这种实际的科学的试验和计算，铁道部制定了初步加固计划，在去年十二月二十一日命令郑州铁路管理局完成此项加固计划。郑州局接到命令以后，自十二月二十七日动工，到今年一月四日九天当中，就完成了投片石保卫桥脚，重铆下承横梁，增加临时排架，整理桥面，更换钢轨等项工作。当时铁道部派人试车三次：第一次用二——六——二小型机车两台重联，隔离空车两辆过桥，运行时间十二分半，合时速十五公里；第二次两台机车重联，未隔离空车运行，运行时间九分半，合时速二十公里弱；最后一次两台机车重联，牵引一千二百七十吨，以十三分钟过桥，合时速十五公里弱，桥梁无异状。这样，列车自黄河北岸至南岸只需二十二分钟，比过去需要三小时的效率提高了七、八倍。这个试验有力地推翻了以往几十年来五公里徐行的规定，打破了过去技术上的保守主义，证明了改善与加固该桥的办法是正确的。为了进一步加强黄河铁桥，铁道部已决定设计全面的加固工程，今年二月并在黄河铁桥成立了桥工段，负责该桥的改善补强、养护等工作。
            黄河桥的新生
    当记者访问该桥时，桥工段的工人正紧张地工作。他们曾经利用春节的假期，把护轮轨整个铺设完备，防止车轮出轨的不幸事故。他们编了四百四十三个铁丝笼，以一百六十一个铁丝笼网着桥桩周围的片石，预防急流冲散片石破坏桥脚。他们连续投下了一千多立方公尺的片石，保卫桥桩。他们矫正了桥梁的偏向，更换了不匀的钢轨，清除了桥墩积草，以巩固两端的堤岸。现在桥工正在大量更换新的枕木，随时注意螺丝松动和道钉浮起的现象。在每个桥墩附近，都派了一两个人经常检查钢梁以防出毛病。桥工段并准备实行新型养路护桥方法，已成立包检组，计划实行包修组，贯彻负责制。工人们说：“我们的眼睛一刻不停地看着桥，我们的手时时保养桥；桥是我们的家，我们的财产，我们决不再像过去那样不关心它了。”当记者看见一辆辆列车以十五分钟驶过该桥的时候，守候桥面的工人就仔细地检查桥轨状况。当机车准备过桥时，工人们都躺在机车下面小心地检视机车零件。桥工段工会主任余宝亭说，他们在这里工作了四十来年，从来就没有今天这样良好的劳动态度。最近，郑州局商讨加强黄河桥的工作，决定了修理的计划。准备配合着铁道部即将拟就的加固计划，把个别军用梁加强，更换不正常杆件。为了避免列车的摇摆，并将增加军用梁各排间的螺栓，使它成为整体。为了防止洪水，准备储藏片石一万立方尺，以便在大水时护卫桥基，在桥的两端抛片石四千立方尺，以护堤岸。此外，还要油漆钢梁，修补桁梁，增长桥梁的寿命。黄河桥桥工段根据这个修理计划，正组织力量日内即可动工。这样，黄河铁桥将会更加坚固，增加载重能力，提高运输效率。
            目前的问题
    在记者访问黄河铁桥的同时，并访问了几位工程师。郑州路局局长吴士恩，是一个总工程师，他认为黄河铁桥经过加固后，像今天这样行车是没有问题的。王度工程师觉得桥面、桥梁都还可以使用，但桥脚不够坚实，没有桥墩，仅是螺旋形钢柱支撑着桥梁，所以他说根本解决的问题，是加强桥脚。吴士恩局长也有这种看法。不过他们都一致以为只要时时刻刻注意养护，经常加固，黄河铁桥再使用八九年，是没有很大问题的。
    记者和工人们谈到最近的工作时，他们提出了以下几个问题：（一）希望铁道部赶快拟定加固计划，以便在洪水之前完成加固工作；（二）修理工作的计划不够周到，突击性的任务忽然布置下来，使得员工忙于突击，经常性的工作不能和突击工作配合起来；（三）材料供应不及时，还没有完全把黄河桥的工作放在最重要的地位；（四）列车过桥时，改用小型机车，往往因机车调配不快，影响过桥时间。有些员工还在怀疑黄河桥可以继续使用，他们觉得：“几十年来，就没走过十五公里的时速；今天桥更旧了，为什么还要提高行车速度？”这种没有科学根据的猜度，没有加以澄清。当地工会没有把铁道部检查和试验该桥的情形和结果详细地告诉员工，这将会影响黄河桥进一步加固的工作。该桥桥工段段长张铭基告诉记者，该段员工大多有四五十岁，年轻力壮的人不很多。在该桥工作多年的桥工所主任汤应关，是一个非技术人员，他说，在他负责领导该桥工作时，碰到许多技术工作没能很好的解决。由于该桥技术人员缺乏，工程师又不常来现场，这些技术工作往往拖延很久，影响铁桥工作。这些现象，在今天是急需解决的，决不能继续任其存在了。
