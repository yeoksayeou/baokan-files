　　U.S. Imperialism is the Number One Enemy of the Vietnamese People!
    Saigon Anti-American and Anti-French Movement Continues
    Vietnam National United Front Calls on People for Support

    [Xinhua News Agency, March 30th] The anti-American and anti-French imperialism movement of the Saigon people has been continuing since the large-scale demonstration by Saigon students on March 19th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Saigon on the 28th, leaflets are found in Saigon every day, denouncing the United States as the "number one enemy" and calling for "overthrowing American aid." It calls on soldiers, workers, and people from all walks of life to "support the patriotic people of the whole country." A few days ago, Saigon journalists decided to strike, demanding freedom of the press. On the 28th, only three Vietnamese newspapers were published in Saigon, and they were all printed by the newspaper owners themselves because the printing workers were still on strike. Four lawyers have withdrawn from the Saigon court, protesting the authorities' arrest of two lawyers on charges of participating in recent demonstrations.
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 30th] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, March 28th: The Central Committee of the Vietnam National United Front called on all Vietnamese people to support the struggle of the youth and people of Saigon and Dike against American aid to the French colonialists. The call stated: "U.S. imperialism is openly interfering in the war in Vietnam. They are directly assisting the French colonialists and the traitors of Vietnam. The so-called visit of the U.S. Seventh Fleet to Saigon is only intended to intimidate the Vietnamese people and test Vietnam's public opinion toward the United States. The people of Saigon have made it clear to the United States that the Vietnamese people have a steely and firm attitude. The bloody demonstration on March 19th was a heavy slap in the face to the U.S. imperialists and the French colonialists." The Vietnam National United Front denounced the U.S. imperialists' sinister plans and the despicable servility of the French colonialists and their lackeys – Bao Dai and Nguyen Van Long. It called on all democratic forces in the world to rise up and protest against the U.S. expansionist policy in Indochina; and called on the people of Vietnam, especially those in the French-occupied areas, to support the struggle of the Saigon people. The call concluded by saying that U.S. imperialism will ultimately fail in Vietnam, just as it failed in China.

　　美帝是越南人民的头号敌人！
    西贡反美法运动继续中
    越民族统一战线号召人民支援
    【新华社三十日讯】自三月十九日西贡学生举行大示威以来，西贡人民的反对美法帝国主义的运动仍在继续中。据路透社西贡二十八日消息：西贡市内每天都发现传单，斥责美国是“头号敌人”，号召“打倒美国的援助”。号召战士、工人及各界人民“支援全国的爱国人士”，数日以前，西贡的新闻工作者决定罢工，要求新闻自由。二十八日，西贡只有三家越文报出版，而且都是报纸老板自己印出来的，因为印刷工人仍在罢工。西贡法庭中已有四位律师退席，抗议当局以参加最近的示威为罪名，逮捕了两位律师。
    【新华社三十日讯】越南通讯社北越二十八日讯：越南民族统一战线中央委员会号召全越南人民支持西贡与堤岸的青年和人民的反对美国援助法国殖民者的斗争。该号召称：“美帝国主义者公开干涉越南的战争。他们直接援助法国殖民者与越南的卖国贼。美国第七舰队对西贡的所谓访问，只是想要恐吓越南人民和试探越南对于美国的舆论而已。西贡人民已使美国清楚地看到越南人民钢铁般的坚强态度。三月十九日流血的示威游行，是对美帝国主义者和法国殖民者打了一记重重的耳光。”越南民族统一战线斥责美帝罪恶的计划与法国殖民者及其走狗们——保大与阮文龙——可鄙的奴颜婢膝。它号召全世界的民主势力都起而抗议美国对印度支那的扩张主义政策；并号召越南全国人民，特别是法占区的人民，支持西贡人民的斗争。号召最后说，美帝国主义在越南最后一定会失败，也像他们在中国的失败一样。
