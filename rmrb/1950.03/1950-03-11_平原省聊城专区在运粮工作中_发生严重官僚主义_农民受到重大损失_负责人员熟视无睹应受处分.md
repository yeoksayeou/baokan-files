According to a circular issued by the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office on February 24th: In the autumn grain collection work, most counties quickly completed the task of grain storage due to the active and responsible work of cadres. However, some counties, due to a lack of planning and serious bureaucratic work styles of cadres at all levels, caused significant losses in manpower and resources. According to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office's inspection of the grain transfer and storage work, a total of ten people were injured, fifty-seven cattle died, fifty-eight cattle were injured, and two hundred and forty-four large cart parts were damaged during this grain transportation work. Fines of 279,000 yuan were levied for damaging roads. In counties such as Gaotang, Xin, and Chiping, due to inadequate prior planning, large carts were congested, causing some people to wait for three to five days in the freezing cold without being able to unload their grain. Some cattle died, some people fell ill, and most people lacked sufficient food and clothing, while the grain collection cadres turned a blind eye and continued to sleep late and rise early. Some warehouse officials sat in their offices and issued orders by telephone, causing the masses to transport grain back and forth without a fixed destination. This serious bureaucratic work style caused significant losses to the people.

Some cadres did not value state property, and there were serious instances of waste in the construction and storage work. For example, Guan County stored a total of 3,660,000 jin of grain, employing 889 laborers, with each person storing an average of 4,100 jin of grain; this was six times more wasteful than Yanggu, where each person stored an average of 25,000 jin. The Gaotang city warehouse scattered a lot of grain, and pigs and chickens often trampled on it, but no one managed it. State property suffered unnecessary and serious losses.

In some counties, such as Shou Zhang, Tangyi, Gaotang, and Xin, cadres did not conduct thorough inspections, and deputy warehouse keepers did not patrol diligently. In the past month, there were nine incidents of public grain theft, resulting in an estimated loss of over 2,000 jin. Most of the cases that have been solved involved landlords and illegal elements. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office circular pointed out that each of these counties should effectively strengthen public security work, launch a mass anti-theft campaign, and strictly prevent any sabotage activities by bandits and special agents in order to protect the integrity of state property.

Editor's note: The serious bureaucratic errors committed by the Liaocheng Prefecture of Pingyuan Province in the grain transportation work, causing significant losses to the peasants, are absolutely unacceptable. The circular issued by the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office on February 24th did not immediately propose measures to deal with this incident. We demand that the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office conduct a review and promptly punish the responsible personnel involved in this incident, adopt effective measures to compensate the peasants' losses, and publish the results of the handling.

　　平原省聊城专区在运粮工作中
    发生严重官僚主义  农民受到重大损失
    负责人员熟视无睹应受处分
    【本报讯】据聊城专署二月二十四日通报：该专署在秋征工作中，一般县份由于干部积极负责，很快完成粮食入仓任务。有些县则由于工作无计划，及各级干部有着严重的官僚主义作风，致造成人力、财力的重大损失。根据该专署对调粮入仓工作的检查，在此次运粮工作中，全区共伤人十名，死牛五十七头，伤牛五十八头，损坏大车零件二百四十四件，因轧坏公路被罚款二十七万九千元。高唐、莘县、茌平等县，由于事先计划不周，大车拥挤，使有些群众在冰天雪地中等了三天至五天，粮还卸不下来。有的牛死了，有的人病了，多数群众衣食不足，而收粮干部则熟视无睹，自己仍晚起早息。有的仓库负责干部始终坐在机关里用电话下命令，使群众来回拉运，没有定处。这种严重的官僚主义作风，造成人民重大损失。
    有的干部不重视国家资财，在建仓入库工作中，存在着严重的浪费现象。如冠县全县共收入仓粮三百六十六万余斤，就雇用民工八百八十九人，每人平均收粮四千一百余斤；比阳谷每人平均收二万五千余斤，浪费六倍。高唐城仓则抛撒粮食很多，并经常有猪、鸡等糟踏，亦无人管理。国家资财受到不应有的严重损失。
    有些县份，如寿张、堂邑、高唐、莘县，由于干部不作普遍深入检查，代库员不认真打更，近一月多来，共发生偷盗公粮事件九起，约计损失二千余斤。已破案者多系地主成份和不法分子所为。专署通报中指出各该县今后均应切实加强公安工作，发起群众性的防盗运动，并严防匪特的任何破坏行为，以保护国家资财完整无损。
    编者按：平原省聊城专区在运粮工作中犯了这样严重的官僚主义错误，使农民遭受重大损失，是决不能容许的。聊城专署二月二十四日的通报中没有即时提出对这个事件的处理办法。我们要求聊城专署进行检讨，并对此事件有关的负责人员迅速予以处分，采用有效办法，补偿农民的损失。并将处理结果公布。
