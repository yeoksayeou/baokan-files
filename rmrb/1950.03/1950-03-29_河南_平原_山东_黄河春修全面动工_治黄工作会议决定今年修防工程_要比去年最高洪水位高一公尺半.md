Xinhua News Agency: Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong's Yellow River spring repair projects have fully commenced. The aforementioned three provinces convened a Yellow River management work conference in January of this year, deciding that this year's Yellow River repair and defense projects should aim to prevent breaches even in the event of floods greater than those of 1949. Therefore, dike repairs must be 1.5 meters higher than last year's highest flood level. Since the beginning of March, river workers in each province, under the unified leadership of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the provincial people's governments, have been going to work on the dikes.

　　Henan has a smaller dike restoration task this spring. Since late February, the province has concentrated its efforts on transporting stone materials. By mid-month, over 22,000 cubic meters of stone materials had been transported. Over 30,000 willow trees have been planted in the Zhongmu section. Repair and reinforcement projects have now begun in the Chenliu and Lanfeng sections, the Chenggao and Zhengzhou sections, and the Kaifeng section.

　　The Yellow River spring repair project in Pingyuan Province started earlier due to its integration with production and disaster relief. Since March 8th, work has begun on the entire dike line, stretching over 1,000 kilometers on both banks, with a total of over 55,000 river workers involved. During the dike repairs, the river workers in various counties are in high spirits, and a competition for dike repair quality and efficiency has begun. In order to implement the spirit of combining dike restoration with disaster relief, the leading organs in the Puyang section have established a reasonable graded work point system and formulated measures for disaster victims to rent tools, thus resolving the problems of combining full labor and semi-labor forces and the lack of tools. Similar methods have also been adopted in the Fanxian and Shouzhang county sections, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of dike repairs. However, in individual county sections, the leading organs have a vague understanding of the principle that dike restoration should be combined with disaster relief, and that disaster relief must be subordinate to the dike restoration project. Furthermore, the lack of prior investigation, research, and adequate preparation has affected the morale of the workers. For example, in Juancheng Liangshan, thousands of workers waited for three days to receive grain due to insufficient grain preparation and poor distribution organization, wasting over 7,000 workdays. In Juancheng Zuoying, due to a lack of thorough investigation and organization beforehand, workers rushed to the dike during repairs, but the soil was difficult to use because of accumulated water under the dike, and the daily wages of the river workers were not enough to cover their food expenses, affecting the morale of dike repairs.

　　In Shandong, except for the Huiji, Huimin, and Licheng county sections, which started work in early March, other county sections will not be able to start work until late March due to the convening of people's representative meetings and the completion of land reform work. Currently, cadres from various bureaus in the province are moving to the dikes to conduct in-depth inspections of the project. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has also organized two inspection teams, which departed on March 15th to inspect projects in Shandong and Pingyuan.

　　河南  平原  山东
    黄河春修全面动工
    治黄工作会议决定今年修防工程  要比去年最高洪水位高一公尺半
    【新华社讯】河南、平原、山东黄河春修工程业已全面动工。上述三省于今年一月即召开了治黄工作会议，决定今年黄河修防工程，以即使发生比一九四九年更大的洪水也不致决口为目标，因此修堤要高出去年最高洪水位一公尺五寸。各省河工自三月初起在黄河水利委员会和各省人民政府统一领导下，即纷纷上堤工作。
    河南今春复堤任务较小，该省自二月下旬即集中力量赶运石料，截止本月中旬已运到石料二万二千余公方，中牟段已植柳三万余株，现陈留、兰封段，成皋、郑州段，开封段等均已开始进行整险工程。
    平原省黄河春修工程，因结合生产救灾，开工较早，自三月八日起，两岸长达一千余公里的堤线已全部开工，上堤河工共达五万五千余人。在修堤中，各县河工情绪极为旺盛，已展开修堤质量和效率的竞赛。濮阳段领导机关为贯彻复堤结合救灾的精神，已制定合理的等级记工制，并订出了灾民租借工具的办法，因而解决了全劳动力和半劳动力的结合问题和缺乏工具等困难。范县、寿张等县段亦多采用类似办法，大大提高了修堤的质量和效率。但是，个别县段由于领导机关对于复堤结合救灾、救灾必须服从复堤工程的方针认识模糊，事前又缺乏调查研究和充分准备，致影响了民工的修堤情绪。如鄄城梁山由于粮食准备不足，发粮组织不好，几千民工等了三天领不到粮，浪费了七千余工；鄄城左营因事前缺乏缜密调查和组织，在修堤时民工一拥而上，上工后因堤下有积水又不好用土，河工每天做的工资不够吃，影响修堤情绪。
    山东除惠济、惠民、历城等县段于三月初开工外，其他县段因召开人民代表会议，结束土地改革工作，于三月下旬才能开工。现该省各局干部正移居堤上，深入检查工程。黄河水利委员会并组织两个视察组，于三月十五日出发分赴山东、平原两地视察工程。
