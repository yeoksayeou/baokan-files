　　Biography of Ambassador Rudenko
　　Ambassador Teodora Rudenko was born in 1909 into a peasant family. From an early age, he experienced the hard labor of the fields and cruel labor exploitation.

　　After completing his primary education in his village in 1920, he overcame many difficulties to enter a public middle school in a nearby city, where he studied.

　　To continue his studies, he still had to work in the fields or tutor privately to support himself.

　　In 1930, he was arrested and imprisoned for the first time because of his pro-Soviet attitude. After dropping out of school for two years, he was admitted to an industrial vocational school in the most developed city of Qimoshaola, where he actively participated in the student revolutionary movement from the beginning. During this period, he fought against the narrow patriotism and fascism openly encouraged and sheltered by the reactionary government.

　　Because of his revolutionary actions, he was arrested several times, expelled from school, and driven away by the police everywhere. However, to persist in his studies, he lived in many different cities.

　　In 1935, he was arrested again and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment, eventually being held in Dotana Prison, the "Bastille" prison of the Romanian fascist reactionaries. In the difficult conditions of prison life, he engaged in cultural work among the prisoners. He earned the nickname "Poet of Dotana Prison" because he wrote many poems based on the lives and struggles of anti-fascist prisoners.

　　He regained his freedom after August 23, 1944, at the same time as the victorious Soviet Red Army liberated Romania.

　　From 1944 onwards, his work focused on the fields of art and culture, mobilizing and leading artists and scientists to participate in the people's struggle and popularizing culture among the masses.

　　In 1947, he was appointed as the ambassador to Yugoslavia, and in 1948 he was concurrently appointed as the minister of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of Albania.

　　In 1948, he was sent as a member of the Romanian government delegation to the Danube River Coastal States Conference. In 1949, he was elected as the chairman of the first Danube River Commission, with a term of three years.

　　Because of his meritorious service in the practical struggle for the cause of the motherland, the Romanian government awarded him the "Star of the Romanian People's Republic" award certificate, the "Defending the Motherland" award certificate, and the "Anti-Fascist Warrior" medal.
