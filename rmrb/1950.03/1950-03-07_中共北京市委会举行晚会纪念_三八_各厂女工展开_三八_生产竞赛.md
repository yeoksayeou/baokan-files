　　CCP Beijing Municipal Committee Holds Evening Party to Commemorate "March 8th"
    Female Factory Workers Launch "March 8th" Production Competition
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an evening party in the auditorium of the Municipal Committee on the 5th to celebrate International Women's Day "March 8th." Over 400 female staff members from units directly under the Municipal Committee, the Municipal Government, various districts, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Women's Federation, the Public Security Bureau, and cooperatives attended. The evening party was presided over by Yang Yunyu, Director of the Organization Department of the Municipal Women's Federation. At the meeting, Comrade Peng Zhen gave a detailed report on the current problems faced by women. He first pointed out how to solve the problems of the broad masses of women: First, in terms of economy, rural women must first abolish the feudal land system and be distributed land and farm tools. Only when they have land and property can they truly turn over; urban women must have the ability to work. Second, in terms of marriage, women, especially rural women, must truly obtain freedom of marriage. Third, women must participate in social and political activities. The solution to these problems requires firm determination and arduous struggle. Then, Comrade Peng Zhen analyzed the ideological problems of women cadres, explained the cadre policies related to women cadres, and hoped that female comrades would do their jobs well. He also pointed out that looking down on women is a remnant of feudal consciousness. Regarding the issue of raising children, it should be regarded as a glorious social undertaking, not a humble personal matter. Some female comrades have raised the question of how to overcome the shortcomings of female comrades, such as narrow-mindedness and triviality. He replied: The way to overcome this is to consciously and systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory, and to discuss more issues related to major domestic and international events and the general policies of various tasks. In a free speech, Comrade Sha Xin from the Eleventh District examined his own thoughts based on Comrade Peng Zhen's report. Finally, the Fengming Opera Troupe performed Ping Opera.
    [Beijing News] Female workers of the Beijing Garment Factory and Renli Carpet Company commemorated "March 8th" by intensifying production and launching production competitions with practical actions.

　　中共北京市委会举行晚会纪念“三八”
    各厂女工展开“三八”生产竞赛
    【北京讯】中国共产党北京市委会，于五日在市委大礼堂举行庆祝“三八”国际妇女节晚会。到有市委直属各单位及市府、各区、中苏友好协会、妇联、公安局、合作社等机关女工作人员四百余人。晚会由市妇联组织部长杨蕴玉主持。会上彭真同志对目前妇女所存在的问题作了详尽的报告，他首先指出如何解决广大妇女群众的问题：一、在经济方面，农村妇女首先必须废除封建土地制度，分得土地农具，有了土地财产才真正翻身，城市妇女必须自己有作事的本领和工作能力。二、在婚姻方面，妇女群众特别是农村妇女群众，必须真正获得婚姻自由。三、妇女要参加社会活动，政治活动。这些问题的解决都需要有坚定的决心与艰苦的斗争。接着彭真同志又分析了妇女干部的思想问题，说明了与妇女干部有关的干部政策，希望女同志要把自己所担任的工作做好。他并指出看不起妇女的思想，乃是一种封建意识的残余。关于抚育子女问题，应视为是光荣的社会事业，并不是可卑的个人私事。有些女同志曾提出如何克服女同志的思想狭隘、琐碎等缺点，他答复说：克服的办法就是要自觉的有计划的学习马列主义理论，多讨论有关国内外大事和各项工作的方针政策等问题。在自由讲话中，十一区沙辛同志根据彭真同志的报告检讨了自己的思想。最后由凤鸣社演出评戏。
