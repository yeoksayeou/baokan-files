Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 6th -- Wuhan's tax revenue work has achieved significant results after gradual reorganization. From June to December of last year, a total of seven months, the total amount of various tax revenues amounted to more than 260 million jin of rice, guaranteeing national fiscal revenue, absorbing a large amount of currency recall, and playing a certain role in stabilizing prices.

At the beginning of the liberation, in order to prevent the task of supporting the front lines from being hindered, the Wuhan Military Control Commission retained old personnel and temporarily continued the old tax system on the basis of not disrupting the original tax revenue agencies of the Kuomintang reactionary government, so that tax revenue work and takeover work proceeded simultaneously. In late May of last year, the former Central China Taxation Bureau, Hubei Provincial People's Government, and Wuhan Municipal People's Government began to take over the nineteen large and small tax revenue agencies in Wuhan under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang according to their respective systems, and promptly seized the main sources of tax revenue to levy taxes. The Hankou Commodity Tax Bureau first sent personnel to the cigarette factories, which accounted for 70% to 80% of the commodity tax, to conduct on-site investigations. The Direct Tax Bureau began to sort out the business tax of major industries such as the cotton industry. At the same time, it announced the abolition of the Kuomintang reactionaries' self-defense special donations and other additional exorbitant taxes to reduce the burden on the people.

Since the initial levy was based on the old system and organization, tax revenue inevitably showed a state of chaos. At the same time, due to lack of experience in urban taxation, it was not possible to plan and deploy work according to the affordability of urban industrial and commercial operators, resulting in the assessment of only 1.28 billion yuan for the 1949 first half-year business income tax, which began in late June of last year, equivalent to just over 2.5 million jin of medium-grade rice at the time, far from the actual amount that should have been borne. In addition, tax evasion and tax avoidance were also very common. In particular, at that time, insufficient attention was paid to the collection of business tax, and the set of extremely lax collection methods during the Kuomintang reactionary rule was still used, resulting in a large number of business people evading taxes, and for a time, resident merchants also switched to running single. The market was flooded with business goods, which affected the development of legitimate industry and commerce and the normal income of national finance.

	After Typical Investigations and Democratic Appraisals, the Burdened Area is Expanded and the Burden Rate is Reduced

After the Central China Tax Conference studied these issues in August of last year and decided on improvement measures, Wuhan's tax revenue work took a big step forward. Starting in August of last year, under the instructions of the Central China Taxation Bureau and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, the city's tax revenue agencies were first merged into five sub-bureaus, under the unified leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau, and efforts were made to tighten grassroots organizations. In the collection of industrial and commercial taxes, in order to fully understand the situation and master the actual materials, investigations were first conducted through typical industries and typical households, and then democratic appraisal methods were adopted to ensure that the burden was reasonable. All those merchants who had colluded with the reactionary ruling class before liberation and evaded taxes, and foreign merchants who had consistently relied on imperialist forces to pass on the burden, were taxed according to law. In this way, the city's tax-paying industrial and commercial operators increased from more than 9,000 households before liberation to 29,800 households. Due to the expansion of the burdened area, the burden rate was relatively reduced. Before liberation, the average tax burden rate for taxpayers was 8%, with the highest reaching 30%. According to the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau's investigation in December of last year, the burden rate was generally between 2.5% and 4.5%. In the reorganization of business tax, the two tax items of business tax and temporary income tax levied by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past were merged and levied, and renamed temporary business tax to facilitate merchants and people. At the same time, work groups were set up at docks on major transportation routes and in cargo distribution areas to carry out inspections and anti-smuggling work to block loopholes in tax evasion by some business people. In addition, relying on the help of trade unions, the dynamics of cargo movement were more closely controlled; and cargo depots and resident merchants were united to collect temporary business tax on behalf of the government, and inspection systems were formulated to correct the errors of collecting as much as possible when the first levy was made and failing to conduct accurate investigations of tax sources. After the promulgation of the "Interim Measures for the Collection of Commodity Tax in Central China" in September of last year, in the collection of commodity tax, the registration of untaxed inventory (i.e., market clearance) was implemented, and new tax sources were investigated and registered. At the same time, in order to facilitate merchants and people to handle tax payment procedures nearby, the tax collection work originally concentrated in the municipal bureau was all handed over to the sub-bureaus for handling, so that commodity tax and temporary business tax achieved close cooperation in tax collection work, and the tax sources were more strongly controlled.

Due to the above-mentioned various efforts and the increasing development of trade between urban and rural areas, Wuhan's tax revenue has increased month by month since August of last year. In June of last year, the income from direct tax, commodity tax, salt tax, and local tax totaled more than 3 million jin of rice, which increased to more than 63.99 million jin in December; temporary business tax increased from more than 173,000 jin in June to more than 11.069 million jin in December; commodity tax also increased from more than 1.02 million jin in June to more than 12.94 million jin in December.

	Resolutely Eliminate Tax Evasion Phenomenon: Municipal Taxation Bureau Conducts Surprise Audits

In order to eliminate the phenomenon of tax evasion, the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau conducted a surprise audit in January of this year. According to the bureau's investigation of 219 households in 19 industries, it was found that 77% of them were making false accounts, and all of the 25 pig dealers sampled were actually false accounts, and their actual turnover was one, two, or even 11.5 times the amount recorded in the false accounts. In addition to generally keeping two sets of accounts, internal and external, to evade taxes, some merchants also concealed their net income by underreporting market prices and concealing funds (for example, the Tong Sheng Paint Store transferred funds to Hankou when auditing in Shanghai, and transferred funds to Shanghai when auditing in Hankou). When collecting industrial and commercial taxes in the third and fourth quarters of last year, many merchants said on the one hand, "More than 90% of the accounts of Wuhan shops are true accounts, and the 'self-declaration and self-payment' method should be adopted for collection," and on the other hand, they shouted "heavy taxes" and "difficult business." After this audit, it proved that the tax burden in the past was not heavy. According to the investigation of ten households in the paint industry, which felt the heaviest tax burden in the past, their false accounts accounted for 66% of the true accounts. The industrial and commercial taxes in the third and fourth quarters of last year accounted for 2.93% of the turnover of the false accounts, and only 1.64% of the turnover of the true accounts. After the audit work came to an end, progressive people in the industrial and commercial circles unanimously believed that setting up false accounts was an illegal act and demanded that the government impose appropriate punishments according to the seriousness of the circumstances.

A major loophole in Wuhan's tax revenue work last year was the failure to start sorting out and collecting stall tax. There are about 40,000 large and small stall vendors in Wuhan, and the capital of large stall vendors is not small. After being instructed by the Central China Taxation Bureau, collection began in January of this year.

　　统一税政严密基层组织
    武汉工商各税显著增加     
    七个月税收总额逾大米二亿六千万斤
    【新华社汉口六日电】武汉市的税收工作经过逐步整理后，已获显著成绩。自去年六月至十二月的七个月中，各项税收总额计合大米二亿六千余万斤，保证了国家财政收入，吸收了大批通货回笼，对稳定物价起了一定程度的作用。
    解放之初，武汉市军管会为不使支援前线的任务受到妨碍，在暂不打乱国民党反动政府原有税收机构的基础上留用旧人员，暂时沿用旧税制，使税收工作与接管工作同时并进。去年五月下旬，开始由前华中税务总局，湖北省人民政府、武汉市人民政府分别按系统接管国民党反动统治下在武汉的大、小十九个税收机构，并及时掌握主要税源开征。汉口市货物税局首先对占货物税百分之七十至八十的卷烟厂，派员驻厂调查，直接税局着手整理主要行业如棉花业的行商税，同时宣布取消国民党反动派的自卫特捐等附加苛捐杂税，以减轻人民负担。
    由于最初系按旧的系统和机构开征，税收不免呈现混乱状态。同时由于对城市税收经验不足，未能根据城市工商业者的负担能力来计划布置工作，致去年六月下旬开征的一九四九年上半年营利事业所得税，核定税额仅十二亿八千万元，折合当时中等米二百五十万余斤，与实际应负担的数额相差甚远。此外逃税漏税的现象也很普遍。特别是当时对行商税的征收不够重视，仍沿用国民党反动统治时期的一套极不严密的征收办法，造成行商大量逃税的现象，而一时住商也纷纷改跑单帮，行商货物充斥市场，影响了正当工商业的发展和国家财政的正常收入。
            经过典型调查民主评议  负担面扩大负担率减轻
    去年八月份华中税务会议对这些问题进行研讨并决定改进办法后，武汉市的税收工作便大大前进了一步。去年八月份起，在华中税务总局及武汉市人民政府的指示下，首先将全市各税收机构合并为五个分局，受武汉市税务局的统一领导，并努力严密基层组织。在工商业税的征收方面，为充分了解情况和掌握实际材料，首先通过典型行业和典型户的调查，然后采取民主评议的方法，使做到负担合理。对于在解放前与反动统治阶级相勾结而漏税的部分商人和一贯依仗帝国主义势力转嫁负担的外商都一律依法课税。这样，全市纳税的工商业者就从解放前的九千余户增加到两万九千八百户。由于负担面的扩大，负担率就相对地减低。解放前纳税人员担率平均为百分之八，最高者达百分之三十，解放后据武汉市税务局去年十二月份的调查，负担率一般在百分之二点五至四点五之间。在行商税的整理方面，将过去国民党反动派所征的行商营业税和一时所得税两个税目合并征收，改称为临时商业税以便利商民，同时，在交通要道的码头以及货物集散地区设立工作组，展开稽查与缉私工作，以堵塞部分行商逃税的漏洞。此外还依靠工会的帮助，较严密地掌握了货运动态；并团结行栈和住商代征临时商业税，制定检查制度，纠正了最初开征时收多少算多少和对税源不作精确调查的错误。去年九月份《华中货物税征收暂行办法》公布以后，在货物税征收方面，实行了未税存货登记（即清理市场），并对新税源进行调查登记。同时为便利商民就近办理纳税手续，将原来集中在市局办理的征税工作，全部交由各分局办理，使货物税与临时商业税在征收工作上取得密切配合，加强掌握了税源。
    由于上述的各种努力以及城乡贸易的日渐开展，去年八月份以后，武汉市的税收便逐月增加。去年六月份直接税、货物税、盐税、地方税的收入共合大米三百余万斤，至十二月份即增加到六千三百九十九万余斤；临时商业税从六月份的十七万三千余斤增加到十二月份的一千一百零六万九千余斤；货物税也从六月份的一百零二万余斤，增加到十二月份一千二百九十四万斤。
            坚决消灭漏税现象  市税务局突击查账
    为了消灭漏税现象，武汉市税务局在今年一月进行了突击性的查账工作。据该局调查十九个行业共二百十九户的结果，发现造假账的达百分之七十七，其中被抽查的二十五家猪行竟全部是假账，其实际营业额竟为假账记载的一倍、二倍甚至十一倍半。部分商人除普遍以内外两套账册记账逃税外，并以短报市价、隐匿资金（如同胜颜料号于上海查账时将资金汇汉口，汉口查账时又将资金汇上海）等等方法隐瞒纯收益。去年征收三、四两季工商业税时，很多商人一面说：“武汉市商店的账百分之九十以上是真账，应该采用‘自报自缴’的方式征收”，一面喊“税重”，“生意难做”。经过这次查账后，证明过去税收负担并不重。过去感觉税重最甚的颜料业，据调查十家的结果，他们的假账竟占真账的百分之六十六，去年三、四两季工商业税占假账营业额百分之二点九三，占真账营业额仅百分之一点六四。此次查账工作告一段落后，工商界的进步人士都一致认为私设假账是不法行为，要求政府就其情节轻重予以应得的处分。
    去年武汉市税收工作中的一大漏洞是未着手整理和征收摊贩税。武汉市有大小摊贩四万户左右，大摊贩资本额不算小。经华中税务总局指示后，已于今年一月份开始征收。
