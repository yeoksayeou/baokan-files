Reducing costs and accumulating funds

A Summary of the Working Conference of the Cost Accounting Research Group of Qingdao Zhongfang No. 1 Factory

Li Zhuping

Vigorously practicing economy and reducing production costs in state-owned industrial sectors not only provides significant assistance in overcoming the current national financial difficulties, but also holds more positive significance for the development of New Democratic industry. This is because reducing costs is one of the fundamental sources of national capital accumulation and a necessary condition for restoring and expanding reproduction. The lower the cost, the more profit the enterprise will make, enabling the enterprise or the entire country to liberate more funds for the recovery and expansion of national industrial reproduction. Chairman Mao instructed us in "On Coalition Government": "In order to develop industry, a large amount of capital is needed." The source "mainly relies on the Chinese people themselves to accumulate capital." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued an economic directive for the 1927-28 fiscal year, stating: "The main task of developing the economy is the struggle to reduce industrial costs. This struggle must be the central task of the Party, all production organs, and all economic organs." In June 1931, Stalin more explicitly taught Soviet economic personnel: "Reducing costs by one percent is equivalent to accumulating 150 to 200 million rubles more within the industry." Therefore, he demanded "systematic reduction of costs and strengthening of internal accumulation in all industrial sectors without exception."

Qingdao Zhongfang is a state-owned industry, and we should shoulder the glorious task assigned to us by the state of solving financial difficulties and accumulating funds. As long as all our employees work together and do it earnestly, we will definitely accomplish this task. Taking the eight textile factories in Qingdao as an example, they can produce at least 18,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 360,000 bolts of fine cloth per month. If we can reduce costs by 2 percent, we can earn an additional 20 billion RMB for the country. What an amazing number this is!

After liberation, under the correct leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, thanks to the efforts of all employees, Qingdao Zhongfang has achieved great success in reducing production costs. For example, from January to May of last year (before liberation), the average amount of raw cotton used for each piece of 20-count cotton yarn was 410.82 *jin*, while from June to November after liberation, the average amount used was only 401.19 *jin*. In the five months after liberation, the average amount of raw yarn used for each bolt of 12-pound fine cloth was 11.19 pounds; in the six months after liberation, the average amount used was only 11.09 pounds. This means that 9.63 *jin* of raw cotton was saved per piece of yarn. In the six months, 56,842.17 pieces of yarn were produced, saving a total of 547,390 *jin* of raw cotton. In terms of the total cost of yarn, it was reduced by more than 2.4 percent. In terms of enterprise profit and national capital accumulation, an additional 3.2 billion RMB was earned (raw cotton was 6,000 RMB per *jin*). The amount of raw yarn saved per bolt of fine cloth was 0.1 pounds, and 1,199,608 bolts of cloth were produced in six months, saving a total of 100,199.6 pounds of raw yarn. In terms of the total cost of cloth, it was reduced by 0.7 percent; in terms of raw material costs, it was reduced by nearly 1 percent; in terms of enterprise profit and national capital accumulation, an additional 957.768 million RMB was earned (raw yarn was 8,000 RMB per pound). Compared with before liberation, the total savings of these two raw materials was 4.004202 billion RMB. The value generated by improving output and quality, saving materials, machine parts, water, electricity, labor, etc., as well as the investigation of nearly 10 billion RMB of off-book materials and a large number of so-called waste materials, are not included in the calculation.

This is the great labor creation of all Zhongfang employees, and we should consolidate this achievement well. However, we cannot be proud and complacent because of these achievements, because these achievements are only in comparison with the production during the Kuomintang rule. There are still many serious weaknesses in our work. For example, in November last year, the eight cloth factories started work for 17 days and produced 294,232 bolts of cloth. According to general standards, 2,464 shuttles should have been used, but the actual number used was 7,958, which means that 5,494 shuttles were wasted. Counting four shuttles for one bolt of 12-pound fine cloth, a total of 1,374 bolts of fine cloth are needed. In terms of the cost of cloth, it increased by 0.47 percent. In terms of enterprise profit and national wealth, 205.95 million RMB was lost. And this is just one of many materials. The consumption of raw materials, auxiliary materials, water, electricity, and labor, etc., has many areas worthy of research and improvement.

The above two examples do not fully illustrate the true situation of Zhongfang products. This is merely to tell us the significance of reducing costs for increasing national wealth and that we can and must better study how to further reduce product costs.

To reduce production costs, we must establish a strict economic accounting system in the enterprise. The economic accounting system is the basic method of managing production. According to the current specific situation of Qingdao Zhongfang, we believe that to establish a strict economic accounting system, we must first:

1.  Effectively grasp the current true cost situation, which is one of the main conditions for establishing an economic accounting system. Establishing a classified cost accounting system with the workshop as a unit is the only way to understand the true cost situation of each type of product, each period, and each production process. We must effectively control the true cost situation and truly understand the exact numbers of raw materials, materials, machine parts, fuels, water, electricity, repair costs, labor, factory management expenses, company operating expenses, and various taxes, fees, financial, depreciation, and insurance expenses consumed in the finished product. Because the cost level is determined by the size of the consumption figures of the above items. Only by conducting specific investigations and research on the consumption figures and making scientific analysis can we find out which factors cause the cost to increase or decrease in a specific product in a specific period or specific production process, and overcome or consolidate these factors. Stalin regarded "promoting and consolidating the cost accounting system and increasing internal capital accumulation in industry" as the main task of organizing the entire Soviet people to complete the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. This means that we must establish a cost accounting system with the workshop (and possibly the production team) as a unit that can specifically analyze costs, effectively control the true cost situation of each production process, in order to consciously and purposefully find the basis for reducing costs. It is best to formulate cost plans and savings plans for various technical quotas in production and various raw materials and material quotas consumed in the finished product based on past experience and current actual conditions, and check the work according to these quotas and plans. Secondly, it must be stated that "the cost of production is an indicator of the quality of the entire work of the factory." (Malinov) Therefore, the statements developed by the precise cost accounting system must be used as the basis for us to check the work of various departments. Only by checking the work performance of cadres based on the cost level of a certain enterprise can we ensure that the enterprise will not lose money and gradually make money, and overcome the "supply thinking" that generally exists among enterprise managers. In factories that are not single-product, failure to establish an accurate classified cost accounting system will increase the blindness of market value.

However, the cost accounting system of Zhongfang has many areas that need to be studied. First, it is only divided into two major categories, yarn and cloth, and is not calculated by workshop and classified according to various finished products. Secondly, its various expenses are based on estimated allocation methods, and are not directly obtained according to the actual figures consumed by a certain finished product in a certain production process. Third, when various expenses are too high or too low, they can be adjusted, and when raw materials and materials are consumed too much or too little, "overdraft" or "temporary storage" methods can be used to maintain the balance of costs in each period. Fourth, there are no detailed records of raw materials, materials, machine parts, water, electricity, and labor consumed by the workshop. Although some people say that such a cost accounting system: "It is adjusted by inventorying semi-finished products and factory cotton stocks, and then expensed according to loss, so the usage listed on the cost sheet can often conform to the standard." However, it cannot control the true cost situation. When our cost reports in September last year showed that the cost of 20-count yarn in a certain factory was equivalent to 510 *jin* of seven-eighth grade cotton, while another factory was 580 *jin*, we conducted research. As a result, we could not find any experience to introduce from the factory with 510 *jin*, nor could we find any shortcomings that needed to be overcome from the factory with 580 *jin*, because neither of these numbers was very reliable. In addition, such as Zhou Yulin, an engineer of the Ninth Factory, when he left his job and made an inventory in the winter of 1947, the factory was short 400,000 pounds of yarn. Later, 300,000 pounds were found in the warehouse, and the other 100,000 pounds were added to the subsequent products, which solved this muddled account. It can be explained from here that the cost reports under the existing cost accounting system are difficult to be used as a basis for studying how to reduce costs and as an indicator for checking the work of various departments of the factory, and as a measure of market prices.

2.  Only by practicing thrift and frugality can we vigorously carry out economic construction and turn an agricultural country into an industrial country. Therefore, we must mobilize all resources within the enterprise to use limited funds in the most reasonable and economical way. All enterprise personnel must "calculate money accurately and honestly" (Lenin), must precisely distinguish the priorities and use every RMB in a planned way to invest in the most appropriate place at the most appropriate time to the most meaningful production. We must immediately find ways to quickly turn dead stock, waste materials, sundries, unused materials, and excessive materials in the warehouse that can be turned into funds. We must try our best to formulate more detailed supply plans for materials, cash, etc., so as to provide the needs of production in a timely manner. We must overcome the past "fear of trouble" thinking with a spirit of responsibility to the enterprise. The financial department should quickly find ways to gradually establish a strict budget system to ensure the rapid flow of funds. We must learn to live a poor life. Only in this way can we overcome all difficulties in our work. Therefore, all personnel in the enterprise should regard "stranded funds" as a serious waste, and the loss it causes to the enterprise is the same as corruption and waste in terms of objective effect.

3.  Rectify the warehouse, establish a warehousing system, and strictly implement the weighing and counting system when receiving raw materials. In the warehouse, tightly control the raw material entry, finished product exit, and the handover between the upper and lower workshops in the production process. We must clarify the numbers, strictly follow the procedures, distinguish responsibilities, and especially have accurate workshop records. Chairman Mao said: "The income and expenditure of each factory unit should have a certain system and procedures to end the confused phenomenon of unclear income and expenditure and incomplete procedures." We must strictly implement Chairman Mao's instruction and improve the many incomplete procedures that still exist.

Finally, let me repeat that establishing an economic accounting system, vigorously saving, reducing costs, and accumulating capital are the central tasks of state-owned light industry sectors. The leaders of enterprises should formulate a clear plan for reducing costs and accumulating capital in 1950 based on the specific situation of their own enterprises, organize all forces, and fight to complete this glorious task. We believe that as long as we have the spirit of diligence and thrift in our work, on the basis of the production in the past six months, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, coupled with the concerted efforts of all employees, we will surely be able to complete this task.

　　降低成本积累资金
    青岛中纺一厂成本会计研究组工作会议总结的一部分
    李竹平
    国营工业部门厉行节约，降低生产成本，不仅对克服当前国家财政困难有重大的帮助，而且对发展新民主主义工业，具有更积极的意义。因为降低成本，是国家资金累积的根本源泉之一，是恢复与扩大再生产的一个必要条件。成本愈低，不仅企业不会亏本，而且能得到更多赢利，使企业或整个国家有更多的资金被解放出来，用于国家工业的恢复和扩大再生产之上。毛主席在论联合政府里就指示我们：“为着发展工业，需要大批资本。”其来源“主要地依靠中国人民自己积累资本”。联共中央发出的关于一九二七——二八年度的经济指令中说：“发展经济的主要任务，就是降低工业成本的斗争。这一斗争必须是党、各生产机关及各经济机关的中心工作。”斯大林在一九三一年六月更明确的教导苏联经济人员：“把成本降低百分之一，就等于工业内部多积累一万五千万到二万万卢布。”因此，他要求“有系统的降低成本费，在所有一切而无例外的工业部门里，加强工业内部积累。”
    青岛中纺是国营工业，我们应该负担起国家交给我们的解决财政困难和积累资金的光荣任务，只要我们全体职工一致努力，认真的来做，一定会完成这一任务的。就以青岛八个纺织厂来说，每月至少可产棉纱一万八千件，细布三十六万匹，如果能降低成本百分之二，就可以替国家多赚人民币二百亿。这是一个如何惊人的数字！
    青岛中纺在解放后，在人民政府和中共的正确领导下，由于全体职工的努力，对降低生产成本工作，已经获得很大成绩。如去年一月至五月（解放前），二十支棉纱平均每件扯用原棉四一○·八二市斤，而解放后六月至十一月平均每件只扯四○一·一九市斤。解放后五个月，十二磅细布平均每匹扯用原纱一一·一九磅强；解放后，六个月，平均每匹只扯一一·○九磅。这就是说，每件纱节省原棉九·六三市斤。六个月产纱五万六千八百四十二点一七件，共节省原棉五十四万七千三百九十市斤。从纱的总成本上说，降低了百分之二点四强。从企业赢利及国家资金积累上说，多赚了人民币卅二亿余万元（原棉每市斤为六千元）。每匹细布节约原纱○·一磅，六个月产布一百一十九万九千六百零八匹，共节省原纱十万零一千九百九十六磅。从布的总成本上说，降低了百分之零点七；从原料成本上说，降低了近百分之一；从企业赢利及国家资金积累上说，多赚了人民币九亿五千七百六十八万元（原纱每磅为八千元）。如与解放前比较，二项原料合计节约人民币四十亿零四千二百零二万元。他如提高产量、质量所产生的价值，节省物料、机料、水、电、人工等费用，以及清查出近一百亿人民币的账外物资及大批所谓废料，还不计算在内。
    这是中纺全体职工伟大的劳动创造，我们应该很好的巩固这一成绩。但我们不能因此骄傲自满，因为这些成绩还仅是与国民党统治时代的生产比较来说的。我们的工作，还存在着许多严重的弱点，如去年十一月份，八个布厂开工十七天，产布二十九万四千二百三十二匹，按照一般标准，应耗用梭子二千四百六十四个，但实际耗用数为七千九百五十八个，这就是说浪费了五千四百九十四个，以一匹十二磅细布换四个计，共计需要细布一千三百七十四匹。从布的成本上说，增加了百分之零点四七。从企业赢利和国家财富上说，损失了人民币二亿零五百九十五万元。这还仅仅是许多物料中的一项。他如原料、副原料、水、电、人工的耗用数量，值得研究和改进的地方还很多。
    上面的二个例子，并不能说明中纺产品全部真实情况，这仅仅是告诉我们降低成本对增加国家财富的意义与我们还可能而且必须更好的研究如何进一步的降低产品成本。
    要降低生产成本，必须在企业中建立严格的经济核算制度。而经济核算制度是管理生产的基本方法。按照青岛中纺目前的具体情况，我们认为要建立严格的经济核算制，首先必须做到：
    一、切实掌握现在的成本真实情况，这是建立经济核算制度的主要条件之一。建立以车间为单位的分类成本会计制度，则又为了解每一种类产品每一时期、每一生产过程成本真实情况的唯一方法。必须有效的控制现在成本的真实情况，确确实实了解耗用在成品中的原料、物料、机料、燃料、水、电、修理费、人工、工厂管理费用、公司的营业费用及各种税捐与财务、折旧、保险等费用的确实数字。因为成本高低，是受上列各项的耗用数字大小来决定的。只有对耗用数字做了具体的调查研究，并作出科学的分析，才能够找出某种产品在某一具体时期或某一具体生产过程当中由于何种因素而使成本增高或降低，并对这些因素加以克服或巩固。斯大林把“发扬巩固成本会计制度，提高工业内部资金积累”，作为组织全苏联人民提前完成战后五年计划的主要任务。这就是说，我们必须建立能对成本作具体分析的以车间（可能时，以生产小组）为单位的成本会计制度，确实有效的控制现在每一生产过程的成本真实情况，以便有意识有目的的找出降低成本的依据。最好能根据过去的经验与现在的实际情况，规定出生产上各种技术定额与消耗在成品成本中各种原、物、材料等定额的成本计划与节约计划，并根据这些定额及计划来检查工作。其次，必须说明“生产品的成本，乃是表明工厂全部工作质量的指标。”（马林诺夫）因此，精确成本会计制度所制定出来的表报，必须能作为我们检查各部门工作的根据。只有根据某一企业成本高低，来检查干部的工作成绩，才能保证这一企业不致亏本并逐渐赚钱，才能克服企业管理人员中普遍存在着的“供给思想”。在非单一生产的工厂里，如果不建立准确的分类成本会计制度，将会增加市场价值的盲目性。
    但中纺组成的成本会计制度，有很多地方是需要研究的。首先，它是仅分纱、布二大类，不是以车间为单位并按照各种成品分类计算的。其次，它的各种费用是采取估计分摊办法，不是按照某种成品在某一生产过程中所耗用的实在数字直接得来的。第三，在各种费用太大或太少时，是可以经过调整，原料、材料耗用太多或太少时，可以用“透支”或“暂存”的办法，以保持各个时期成本的均衡。第四，车间耗用的原料、物料、机料、水、电及人工等，无详实纪录。这样的成本会计制度，虽然有人说：“以盘存的半制品和工场存棉来调剂，然后以损耗出账，所以成本表上所列的用量便能经常和标准符合。”但是，它却不能控制成本的真实情况。当我们去年九月从成本表报上表现某一厂廿支纱成本折合八分之七中级棉五百一十斤，而另一厂为五百八十斤时，就曾进行研究，结果，从五百十斤的厂里找不出可以介绍的经验，从五百八十斤的厂里也找不出需要克服的缺点，因为这二个数字都不太可靠。另外，如九厂工程师周玉林，在一九四七年冬天离职盘存时，工厂少了四十万磅纱，以后在仓库里找出三十万磅，另外十万磅，就加到以后的产品上，这样解决了这笔糊涂账。从这里可以说明现存的成本会计制度下的成本表报，是很难作为研究如何降低成本的依据和检查工厂各部门工作的指标以及作为市场价格的尺度的。
    二、只有节衣缩食，才能大力进行经济建设，把农业国变为工业国。因此，我们必须动员企业内一切资源，把有限的资金，最合理最节约的运用起来。一切企业人员，必须“精确而诚实的计算金钱”（列宁），必须精密的分清轻重缓急有计划的把每一元人民币，在最适当的时机，投向对生产最有意义的地方去。必须立刻设法把仓库可能变为资金的下脚、废料、杂货、不用料、过多料、尽速周转起来。必须尽可能的订出比较周详的物料、现金……等供应计划，以便适时供给生产上的需要。一定要用对企业负责的精神，克服过去“怕麻烦”的思想。财务部门应该迅速的设法逐渐建立严格的预决算制度，以保证资金迅速流转。我们必需学会过穷日子，只有如此，才能克服工作中的一切困难。因此要求企业里的一切人员，应该把“搁浅资金”，看成是严重的浪费，它对企业所造成的损失，在客观效果上与贪污浪费是一样的。
    三、整顿仓库，建立仓储制度，严格原物材料领用时的过秤过数制度。在车库里紧紧的控制原料入口，成品出口及在生产过程中上下车间之间的交接，必须搞清数字，严格手续，分清责任，尤应有数字确实的车间纪录。毛主席说：“每一工厂单位的收入和支出，应有一定的制度和手续，结束收支不清，手续不备的糊涂现象”。我们必须严格的执行毛主席这一指示，改进目前尚存在着的许多手续不备的现象。
    最后再重复地说，建立经济核算制，大力节约，降低成本，积累资本，是国营轻工业部门的中心任务。企业里的领导人员，应该根据自己企业的具体情况，订出一九五零年降低成本与积累资本的明确计划，组织一切力量，为完成这一光荣任务而斗争。我们相信只要我们有克勤克俭从事事业的精神在去年半年来的生产基础上，在共产党及人民政府的正确领导下加上全体职工的一致努力，一定能够完成这一任务的。
