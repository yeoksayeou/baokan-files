Jilin Province's Panshi and Other Counties National Stores Set New Records for Commodity Circulation

[Our Newspaper Dispatches] According to the Northeast Daily News on the 28th of last month: Panshi, Sanchahe, Jiutai, Dehui, Fuyu and other counties in Jilin Province have created new records in rapid commodity circulation. Panshi has the highest commodity turnover rate in the province, with total sales reaching five times the average total inventory value, and average monthly sales per person reaching 425.45 million yuan (Northeast currency); Sanchahe, Jiutai, Dehui, Fuyu and other places followed, with turnover rates all above three times. Shulan's average monthly sales per person reached 472.77 million yuan; Jilin and Jiutai both exceeded 300 million yuan. Taking Panshi as an example, the reasons for the rapid commodity circulation are as follows: (1) Timely allocation and transportation of materials, selling as soon as they arrive, with no backlog in the warehouse. It only takes five days from receiving goods from Jilin to distributing them to various stores and cooperatives, until all are sold. Moreover, it is guaranteed that the goods are sold directly to consumers. In November of last year, commodities sold to grain-selling farmers accounted for 95% of the total sales. (2) Accurately and promptly grasp prices, and adopt the method of transferring accounts with delivery notes, and sell immediately after the notification arrives. (3) A large amount is sold through cooperatives. After the materials arrive, they are sometimes immediately distributed to cooperatives at the railway station according to the plan, and promoted to the countryside through cooperatives. In November of last year, sales through cooperatives accounted for 42.3% of the total sales. Appropriately control the funds of cooperatives and use them to purchase grain and local products. (4) Improve work. Reduce the trouble of payment procedures, implement a person-in-charge system, and adopt a cash-on-delivery method for miscellaneous goods. (5) Strengthen publicity work, extend business hours (from 5:30 am to 8:00 pm), and increase sales. During the peak period of grain purchase, the highest daily sales reached 1.8 billion yuan. The total monthly sales reached over 32.4 billion yuan, accounting for 67.9% of the total grain purchase expenditure. (6) Study business and master skills. For example, the cashier could only receive 50 million yuan per day at the beginning, but now can receive up to 500 million yuan per day in retail sales.

　　吉林省磐石等县国家商店创商品流转新纪录
    【本报讯】据上月二十八日东北日报消息：吉林省磐石、三岔河、九台、德惠、扶余等县，创商品流转迅速新纪录。该省商品营业周转速度最高的为磐石，推销总额达平均库存总值的五倍，每人每月平均售货额为四亿两千五百四十五万元（东北币、下同）；其次是三岔河、九台、德惠、扶余等地营业周转速度，均在三倍以上。舒兰每人每月平均可推销四亿七千二百七十七万元；吉林、九台均在三亿以上。商品流转迅速的原因，可以磐石为例。磐石在营业中：（一）作到物资调拨运输及时，随到随卖，库内绝不积压。由吉林领货到分拨各商店与合作社，直到全部售出，仅需时五日。而且保证了商品直接卖给消费者。去年十一月份推销给卖粮农民的商品占总售额的百分之九十五。（二）正确及时掌握价格，采取了发货单转账办法，通知书到达后，立即出售。（三）大量通过合作社。物资到达后有时在火车站立即按计划分拨给合作社，并通过合作社下乡推销。去年十一月份通过合作社推销占推销总额百分之四二·三。适当掌握合作社资金，通过他们收购粮食、土产。（四）改进工作。减少了付货上手续的麻烦，实行专人负责制，在杂品方面采取了一手交钱，一手交货的办法。（五）加强宣传工作，延长营业时间（早五时半到晚八时），扩大了卖钱额。在购粮最多时期，每日最高推销额达十八亿元。全月卖钱额达三百二十四亿余万元，占购粮总付出额百分之六七·九。（六）钻研业务，熟练技术。如收款员每日最初仅能收五千万元，现在每日零收可达五亿。
