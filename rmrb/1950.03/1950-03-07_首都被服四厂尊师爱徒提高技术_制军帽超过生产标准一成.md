[Beijing News] Since launching the "Respect Teachers and Value Apprentices" campaign and implementing the skill assessment system in February, the Beijing No. 4 Garment Factory has greatly improved its work efficiency. The factory's production task is to manufacture military caps. The production quantity for this year's summer caps is 331,500. Production started on January 20th and is scheduled to be completed on April 10th. However, because this year's cap designs are more complex and difficult to make than last year's, and the workers' skills are extremely unskilled, they felt it would be difficult to complete the task. To overcome this difficulty, the factory, under the leadership of the administration, the Party, the Trade Union, and the Youth League, jointly organized a Technology Research Committee before the start of production. The committee organized each production team into a technology research group, which was led by the Technology Research Committee to study the methods of making this year's summer caps according to the cap design. For example, if the upper brim of the cap is slightly tight, add a strip; if it is slightly loose, add a running stitch; if the cap tile is uneven, make a pleat, and so on. Shortly after the start of production, with the hard work and mutual exchange of experience among workers in each group, the production skills of many workers improved rapidly. However, some apprentices and workers were indifferent to learning skills, and those with good skills were unwilling to work with those who were not skilled. In particular, some masters were unwilling to continue teaching because their apprentices did not listen to guidance and their skills did not improve. This situation affected production. In order to overcome this deviation, the factory believed that it should first start by consolidating and improving the relationship between teachers and apprentices, and launched the "Respect Teachers and Value Apprentices" campaign. At the same time, in order to encourage apprentices and some workers who were not concerned about technology to pay attention to learning skills, on February 16th, the factory specially formed a skill assessment committee to conduct examinations for apprentices. The committee determined scores based on the quality of the products and the time spent, and those who passed with a score of 60 or higher were promoted to workers. The factory has a total of 469 workers, of which more than 70 have teacher-apprentice relationships. A total of 40 people participated in this examination (including 4 who were not apprentices), and 25 of them passed and were promoted to workers. Some teachers and apprentices also signed teacher-apprentice contracts with the assistance of the Trade Union. The teachers guaranteed to teach skills sincerely and wholeheartedly; the apprentices guaranteed to follow the teacher's guidance and learn with an open mind. After the apprentice's production skills reach the standard, they can apply to the Trade Union to work independently. After the teacher-apprentice contracts were signed, the Trade Union often used rest time to hold teacher-apprentice seminars to review the implementation of both parties and carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that the barriers between teachers and apprentices were completely eliminated. Through the "Respect Teachers and Value Apprentices" campaign and the skill assessment system, the enthusiasm of workers for learning and improving skills has been greatly improved, increasing the average output of one worker from 20 caps per day to 39.1 caps, exceeding the production standard (33.3 caps) by more than 11%. Individual workers have created an amazing record of producing 60 caps per day, and the quality can reach no more than 5% return rate. Now each worker has formulated their own production plan and launched a production competition. All workers are confident to guarantee that they will complete this production task nine days ahead of schedule on April 1st.

　　首都被服四厂尊师爱徒提高技术
    制军帽超过生产标准一成
    【北京讯】北京被服四厂自从二月间展开尊师爱徒运动和实行考工制度后，工作效率大大提高。该厂的生产任务是制做军帽，今年夏帽的生产数量是三十三万一千五百顶，自一月二十日开工，计划在四月十日完成。但由于今年的帽样较去年复杂难做，工人技术极不熟练，因此对完成任务感到困难。该厂为克服此种困难，开工前就在行政与党、工、团的领导下，共同组织了技术研究委员会，组织各生产小组成为技术研究小组，由技术研究会根据今年夏帽的帽样领导工人研究做法。如上边的帽沿稍紧一点就扣条，略松一点就跑条，帽瓦不匀就打皱等。开工后不久，在各小组工人努力研究与彼此交流经验下，许多工人的生产技术很快提高了。但有一部分学徒和工人对技术学习漠不关心，而技术好也不愿意和这些技术不好的在一起工作，尤其有些师傅因徒弟不听指导技术不进步，也不愿再带了，这种情况使生产受了影响，该厂为了克服此种偏向认为应先从巩固和搞好师徒关系着手，于是发动尊师爱徒运动；同时为引起学徒及一些不关心技术的工人注重学习技术，二月十六日该厂特组成考工委员会，对学徒进行考试，并根据产品的质量和所用的时间，规定成绩分数，六十分及格者就提升为工人。该厂共有工人四百六十九人，其中有七十余人有师徒关系，这次参加考试的共有四十人（其中有四人不是学徒），结果有二十五人及格被提升为工人。一些师徒并在工会协助下签订了师徒合同，师傅保证诚心诚意传授技术；徒弟保证遵从师傅指导虚心学习。徒弟的生产技术达到标准后，可以申请工会自己独立工作。师徒合同签订后，工会常利用休息时间，召开师徒座谈会，检讨双方执行情形，并展开批评和自我批评，使师徒间的膈膜完全消除了。经过尊师爱徒运动与考工制度，大大提高了工人学习和改善技术的热情，使一个工人的平均产量由每天二十顶增加到三十九点一顶，超过生产标准（三十三点三顶）百分之十一强。个别工人已经创造出日产六十顶的惊人纪录，质量方面都能做到退活不超过百分之五。现在每个工人都制订了自己的生产计划，并展开了生产竞赛，全厂工人有信心保证提前九天在四月一日完成这次的生产任务。
