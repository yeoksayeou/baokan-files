　　Guiding Floating Capital Towards Production
    Wuhan Financial Industry Jointly Issues Loans
    Total Loan Amount Tentatively Set at Thirty Billion
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 26th] In order to guide floating capital towards production enterprises, the Wuhan financial industry, under the leadership of the Hankou branch of the People's Bank of China, held a meeting on the 20th of this month and resolved to establish a joint loan office. Each participating bank and firm will nominate one representative to form a joint loan committee. The total loan amount is tentatively set at 3 billion RMB, to be fully subscribed by the participating banks and firms. The loan recipients will be industries related to the national economy and people's livelihood. If it is discovered that there is an intention or action to use the loan for speculation under the guise of production, the loan will be stopped or the loan will be recovered. The loan period is up to thirty days, divided into two types: RMB collateral loans and discounted tangible collateral loans. In order to take care of the difficulties in capital turnover of private banks and firms participating in the loan when credit is tight, it is stipulated that private banks and firms can apply to the Hankou branch of the People's Bank of China for re-pledge or rediscount on the actual loan amount within their subscribed total loan amount.

    武汉金融业联合放款
    放款总额暂定为三十亿元
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】为引导游资投向生产事业，武汉市金融业在中国人民银行汉口分行领导下于本月二十日开会决议成立联合放款处，由参加各行庄各推代表一人组织联合放款委员会。放款总额暂定为人民币三十亿元，由参加各行庄认足。放款对象为有关国计民生之工业。如发现假借生产名义而以贷款从事投机之意图或行为，即停止贷放或追回放款。放款期限最长为三十天，分本币质押贷款及折实质押贷款两种。为照顾参加贷放的私营行庄在银根紧缩时资金周转的困难，规定私营行庄可就其认放总额内实放款额向人民银行汉口分行办理转质押或重贴现。
