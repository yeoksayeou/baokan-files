    Central Financial and Economic Commission Issues Circular to All Regions:
    Strictly Investigate Responsibility for Coal Mine Accidents and Immediately Improve Safety Systems
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] In view of the recent repeated occurrences of fires, explosions and other accidents in coal mines across the country, resulting in worker casualties and huge losses of national wealth, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a circular to local financial committees and coal mine bureaus a few days ago, demanding strict investigation into worker casualty accidents in coal mines across the country, clarification of responsibilities, and immediate improvement of safety systems. The circular pointed out that the main reason for these extremely serious accidents is that the directors of various mining bureaus, mine managers, and engineering cadres have not paid enough attention to coal mine safety work and employee safety in their guiding ideology, resulting in the failure to improve various ventilation equipment in most mines and the failure to earnestly establish and implement various specialized systems. The circular requires all mines across the country to immediately improve ventilation equipment, improve inspection systems, and establish specialized safety systems; and it instructs local financial committees to earnestly investigate the responsibilities of the mines involved in the accidents, impose disciplinary sanctions on administrative and engineering personnel who are derelict in their duties, and report the handling process to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.
    Note: Last year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, having learned from the serious obstruction accident of the No. 6 generator in the Shijingshan Power Plant, issued three circulars to factories and mines in North China for comprehensive inspection. The National Coal Mine Conference in November also resolved to strengthen coal mine safety work and put forward the slogan "Safety First". However, many coal mines in various regions have still failed to appreciate the spirit of the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee and the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference, so that coal mine management work has not achieved the necessary improvements. Last year, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan Province had already experienced seven serious incidents within six days from December 9th to 14th due to negligence in heating and inadequate machine inspection, causing great losses to state property. The loss of burning down the well shed and the wooden materials for the mine car in the No. 2 plant of the mine alone reached 8,000 catties of millet. The No. 1 plant of the mine damaged a high car, causing the plant to stop work completely for a time. Recently, the accidents have further developed, and extremely serious casualties have occurred continuously in coal mines in various regions. The known ones include: In February, the repair workers of the Fourth Mine of the Fengfeng Coal Mine were riding the man-riding winch car to check the pipes in the wellbore. When going down the well, the winch car pulled down the tripod in the well, causing the death of two workers who fell into the well; an explosion occurred in the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan on February 26, killing 130 miners and injuring 37; when mining coal underground in the No. 6 well of the Xiangjiang Coal Mine, water accumulated about 2,000 tons within 20 minutes due to penetrating the old tunnel, drowning 11 workers; six people died in the Benxi Coal Mine due to rope breakage, and fifteen people died in the Longfeng Well Mine in Fushun.

### 中央财经委员会通令各地  严查煤矿肇事责任立即改进安全制度

　　中央财经委员会通令各地
    严查煤矿肇事责任立即改进安全制度
    【新华社十七日讯】鉴于最近全国各地煤矿迭次发生失火、爆炸及其他事故，造成工人伤亡和国家财富的巨大损失，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会特于日前通令各地财委会及煤矿局，严查最近各地煤矿发生的工人伤亡事故，究明责任，并立即改进安全制度。通令指出：造成最近此种极端严重事故的主要原因，系由于各矿务局长、各矿长以及工程干部在领导思想上对煤矿保安工作与职工安全重视甚为不够，致大多数矿井各种通风设备未能改善，各种专责制度未能认真建立与执行。通令要求全国各矿应立即改善通风设备，健全检查制度，建立保安专责制度；并责成各地财委会对肇事各矿认真追究责任，对行政工程人员之失职者，分别给以纪律处分，并将处理经过情形报告政务院财经委员会。
    按：去年政务院财经委员会因接受石景山发电厂六号发电机发生严重障碍事故的教训，曾三次通报华北各地厂矿进行全面检查，十一月全国煤矿会议亦曾决议加强煤矿保安工作，并提出“保安第一”的口号。但各地煤矿仍多未能体会财委会指示与全国煤矿会议决议的精神，使煤矿管理工作达到应有的改善。去年河南焦作煤矿即曾于十二月九日至十四日六天之内因烤火疏忽与机器检查不周等原因发生严重事件七起，造成国家财产很大的损失。仅该矿二厂烧毁井棚及架车木料损失即达八千斤小米。该矿一厂损坏高车一架，使该厂一度全部停工。最近事故则更加发展，各地煤矿不断地发生了极端严重的伤亡事故，已知者即有：峰峰煤矿四矿二月间修理工人乘人绞稳车大筒检查井筒内的管子，下井时稳车将井内三脚杆子拉倒，致坠井死亡工人二名；河南宜洛煤矿二月二十六日发生爆炸，死矿工一百三十人，伤三十七人；湘江煤矿六号井下捥煤时因透入老窿，二十分钟内即积水约二千吨，淹毙工人十一名；本溪煤矿因断绳死六人，抚顺龙凤井矿死十五人。
