　　Implementing a New Record and Excess Production Double Bonus System
    Andong Paper Mill Continuously Breaks Quotas
    Workers' Operational Skills Improve, Quotas Gradually Become Rationalized
    [Reported by this newspaper] In setting production quotas, Andong Paper Mill, combined with the innovation record movement, implemented a double bonus system for new records and excess production, highly stimulating the workers' enthusiasm for labor, enabling production quotas to be continuously broken and gradually improved. The factory began to formulate production quotas in August of last year. At that time, the quotas were based on theoretical efficiency, international standards, and the factory's actual output. For example, for producing 88-inch newsprint, the theoretical efficiency was 36.26 tons, the international standard was 25.773 tons, and the factory's actual output from January to May of last year averaged 5.333 tons per day. The difference between the actual output and the international standard was set at twelve tons. However, because the production quotas were not based on the improvement of workers' operating skills and machine improvements through the development of the innovation record movement, and because there was no double bonus system for innovation records and excess production, the workers' operating skills were insufficient, and there were many machine accidents. Therefore, in September and October, except for individual machines that reached the quota, the rest failed to reach the quota. For example, for producing 88-inch newsprint, the average daily operating time in September was 15.35 hours. Due to unclean water sources and copper mesh and felt not meeting specifications, frequent shutdowns for repairs took up more than six hours. The paper copying speed per minute had already increased from over 80 meters in the past to 91 meters, but it was reduced to 85 meters due to the lack of consolidation of worker proficiency. The tonnage of paper produced, the highest output in September was 8 tons, and the average output was 7.62968 tons; the average output in October was 7.73365 tons, and the highest output did not exceed 9 tons. Therefore, none of them reached the quota. In November, the quota had to be lowered to eleven tons.

    In November, quota work was combined with the development of the new record movement. With the continuous emergence of new records, workers' enthusiasm for labor and operating skills also increased. The average operating time for producing 88-inch newsprint increased to 18.46 hours, and the copying speed was maintained at 103 meters. The average output was 9.453 tons, and the highest output broke the quota, reaching 12.632 tons. On this basis, the quota was raised to twelve tons. In December, due to the continued improvement of workers' production enthusiasm and operating skills, and the replacement of copper mesh and felt, the average operating time increased to 21.24 hours, and the copying speed increased to 118 meters. The output increased rapidly, with an average output of 12.670 tons and a maximum output of 15.925 tons, greatly exceeding the quota. Therefore, in January of this year, the quota was raised to thirteen tons. In addition to the increase in the production quota of 88-inch newsprint, the quotas for other paper machines have also been continuously increased. For example, the quota for the 100-inch paper machine was 7.5 tons in September, which was increased to 8 tons in December, and then increased to 9 tons in January of this year.

    Simultaneous with the raising of quotas and the innovation record movement, the factory implemented a double bonus system for new records and excess production, which is an important guarantee for consolidating workers' production enthusiasm and continuously breaking quotas. The new record bonus is the bonus for raising the quota. For example, for producing 88-inch newsprint, the quota for December was twelve tons. After a result of fifteen tons appeared, the quota was raised to thirteen tons. This increased ton is the new record, that is, a certain percentage of the value created by one ton throughout the year is taken out as a bonus. The excess production bonus is based on the ratio of excess production in a workshop to determine different bonus rates. At the same time, bonuses are calculated based on different coefficients for each person according to different worker skills. The overall bonus rate is determined based on the total amount of value created (i.e., cost reduction) by exceeding the output. The excess production bonus is calculated monthly. In this way, individuals or units can receive both a new record bonus and an excess production bonus after setting a new record (i.e., increasing the quota). For example, for producing 88-inch newsprint, increasing the quota by one ton in December resulted in a new record bonus of over 13 million yuan, and the output at the end of the month exceeded the new quota, resulting in an excess bonus of 20.4 million yuan. If only excess production is achieved without raising the quota, or if the quota is raised but cannot be maintained, only the excess production bonus is received, and no new record bonus is received.

    Due to the above measures, the workers are very welcome to raise quotas. This not only combines improving production with improving workers' lives, but also continuously improves workers' skills. Chang Junde, a worker in the factory, said: "If you don't raise the quota and can easily complete the task, you can't study the efficiency of the machine and discover the machine's faults." Therefore, all workers welcome raising quotas. For example, the original quota for the 144-inch paper machine was 10.5 tons. After creating a new record of more than 13 tons, the workers automatically requested that the quota be raised to 12.5 tons. In order to consolidate the quota and enable workers to continue to receive new record and excess production bonuses, the leadership set it at 11.5 tons.

    According to the factory's existing machine efficiency and workers' skill level, the quotas have gradually become rationalized, and therefore, the quotas will be consolidated for a considerable period in the future.

　　实行新纪录与超额双重奖励办法
    安东纸厂连续突破定额
    工人操作水平提高定额渐趋合理化
    【本报讯】安东造纸厂在制订生产定额中，结合创新纪录运动，实行了新纪录与超额双重奖励办法，高度发挥了工人的劳动热情，使生产定额连续突破，逐步提高。该厂于去年八月间即开始制订生产定额。当时制订定额是根据理论效能、国际标准及该厂实际产量规定的。如产八八英寸新闻纸，理论效能是三六·二六吨，国际标准是二五·七七三吨，该厂实际产量从去年一月到五月每天平均为五·三三三吨。实际产量与国际标准的差额定为十二吨。但由于没有把生产定额建立在经过开展创新纪录运动，工人操作技术的提高和改良机器的基础上；也没有实行创新纪录与超额双重奖励办法，工人操作熟练程度不够，机器事故多，因此在九、十两月份，除了个别机台达到定额外，其余都未能达到定额。如生产八八英寸新闻纸，九月份平均每日操作时间为一五·三五小时，由于水源不洁，铜网、毛布不合规格，常停机修理，占去时间即超过六小时。每分钟抄速本已由过去八十多米提高到九十一米，因工人熟练程度不巩固，又降低到八十五米。产纸吨数，九月份最高产量为八吨，平均产量为七·六二九六八吨；十月份平均产量为七·七三三六五吨，最高产量亦未超过九吨。故均未达到定额。十一月份就不得不把定额降低为十一吨。
    十一月份，定额工作结合开展新纪录运动，随着新纪录的不断出现，工人劳动热忱与操作技术也随着提高。生产八八英寸新闻纸，平均操作时间增加到一八点四六小时，抄速保持了一○三米。平均产量为九·四五三吨，最高产量则突破了定额，达到十二·六三二吨，在这个基础上，才又把定额提高到十二吨。十二月份，由于工人生产情绪和操作技术的继续提高，更换了铜网和毛布，平均操作时间提高到二一·二四小时，抄速提高到一一八米。产量更是飞速上升，平均产量为一二·六七○吨，最高产量达到一五·九二五吨，大大地超过了定额。因此今年一月又将定额提高到十三吨。除八八英寸新闻纸生产定额的提高外，其他抄纸机定额亦不断提高，如一○○英寸抄纸机，九月份定额为七·五吨，十二月份即提高到八吨，今年一月又提高到九吨。
    与提高定额和创新纪录运动同时，该厂实行新纪录和超额双重奖励办法，是巩固工人生产情绪，连续突破定额的重要保证。新纪录奖励就是提高定额的奖励，如生产八八英寸新闻纸，十二月份定额为十二吨，出现了十五吨的成绩后提高定额到十三吨，提高的这一吨即是新纪录，即按一吨全年创造的价值，拿出一定的比例为奖金。超额奖励就是根据一个车间超过产量的比率，确定不同的提奖率。同时按工人不同技术，确定每人不同系数计算奖金。而总的奖金率则是根据超过产量创造价值（即降低成本）的总额规定的。超额奖励是每月计算一次。这样，个人或单位在创新纪录（即提高定额）以后，既可得到新纪录奖励，又可得到超额奖励。如生产八八英寸新闻纸，十二月份提高定额一吨，即得新纪录奖金一千三百余万元，月末产量又超过了新的定额，即又得超额金二千零四十万元。如果只超额而不提高定额，或提高了不能保持时，只得超额奖不得新纪录奖。
    由于以上措施，工人们对提高定额十分欢迎。这样不仅使提高生产改善工人生活结合起来，而且使工人技术也不断提高。该厂工人常俊德说：“不提高定额随便可以完成任务，就不能研究机器的效能和发现机器的毛病。”因此工人都欢迎提高定额。如一四四英寸抄纸机，原来定额为一○点五吨，在创造十三吨多的新纪录后，工人自动要求把定额提高到十二吨半。领导上为着巩固定额，并使工人能够继续得到新纪录和超额奖励，订为十一吨半。
    根据该厂现有机器效能与工人技术水平，定额已渐趋合理化，因而今后在一段相当长的时期内，将巩固定额。
