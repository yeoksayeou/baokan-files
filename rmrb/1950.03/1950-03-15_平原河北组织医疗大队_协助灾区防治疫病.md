[North China News] The People's Governments of Pingyuan and Hebei provinces have separately organized medical teams to assist disaster areas in preventing epidemics. The Pingyuan Provincial Health Bureau has formed two epidemic prevention teams, each with more than thirty people. They arrived in disaster areas such as Huxi and Shouzhang on February 20th. The main tasks of the epidemic prevention teams are to provide free treatment to existing sick disaster victims (according to the disaster area work team in the province, about 10% of disaster victims are sick); to carry out epidemic prevention and health publicity in conjunction with spring vaccination; and to investigate and study the causes of illness among disaster victims in order to prevent them as early as possible. The epidemic prevention teams will widely cooperate with local Chinese and Western medical personnel, with the aim of completing their tasks within two months. The Hebei Provincial Health Department has formed a medical team of more than 160 people. Except for 30 people who will remain in the province as a mobile force, the remaining personnel will be divided into four teams and stationed in the four special districts of Tianjin, Cangxian, Tangshan, and Tongxian, and epidemic prevention stations will be set up in the severely affected areas. In addition to undertaking epidemic prevention work in disaster areas, the medical team in the province will also cooperate with health institutions at all levels to organize health and epidemic prevention committees at all levels, establish intelligence work, and regularly study the food of disaster victims and introduce simple treatment methods, in order to effectively cooperate with production and disaster relief work.
