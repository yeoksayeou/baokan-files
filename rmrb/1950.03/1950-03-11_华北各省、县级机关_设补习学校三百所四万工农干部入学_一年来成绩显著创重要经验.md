Xinhua News Agency Report: North China provincial and county level agencies have achieved considerable success in establishing on-the-job cadre spare-time cultural remedial schools over the past year, and have created some experiences that can be used as a reference for further promoting remedial schools.

A large number of veteran worker-peasant cadres in North China provinces did not have the opportunity to receive formal education and improve their cultural level due to the long period of war in the past. According to the needs of the work and the urgent demands of the cadres, the leading organs of the provinces specially organized on-the-job cadre spare-time cultural remedial schools, adopting systematic and formal enrollment methods to improve the cultural and knowledge level of worker-peasant cadres. After a year of efforts, the provincial, special district, and county level agencies in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar provinces have established 345 spare-time cultural remedial schools, with a total of more than 45,300 cadres (including some service personnel) enrolled.

Generally, the cultural remedial schools in various places have formulated formal teaching guidelines, academic systems, and various rules. Each school is divided into primary, higher primary, and junior high school levels according to the students' level. The plan is to enable cadres with the lowest cultural level to reach junior high school graduation level in three to five years of spare time. For example, the teaching progress plan in Tangshan is: primary school level graduates in one and a half years, higher primary school level graduates in one year, that is, completing the main courses equivalent to six years of general primary school in two and a half years; the junior high school level is planned to graduate in two and a half years. The curriculum focuses on cultural education, supplemented by political and policy education. Cultural subjects include Chinese language, arithmetic, nature, history, geography, etc. Each school has full-time personnel in charge and employs full-time and part-time teachers. The number of class hours is generally based on twelve hours of spare time per week, and self-study and review are carried out in extracurricular time. In the process of running the schools, systems such as roll call, leave, awards, tests, and homework grading have been gradually established to ensure the standardization of teaching.

After a year of relatively concentrated and standardized learning, cadres in general have made significant improvements in culture. According to the test results in Tangshan, Baoding, and other places, cadres who were originally illiterate or knew only a few words have generally learned 600-700 characters, learned simple four arithmetic operations, and some have learned to write simple letters and reports. Cadres who were originally at the primary school level can now write fluent text and can write articles for newspapers. Some cadres can use punctuation marks more accurately, and have also learned fractions and ratios in arithmetic. Tangshan Higher and Lower Primary Schools held a final exam last year. Of the 1,182 participants, except for 80 who were held back due to excessive absence from class due to official duties, the rest were promoted to higher primary or junior high school levels according to their grades. The school also issued official graduation certificates, which greatly encouraged the cadres' enthusiasm and confidence in learning.

　　华北各省、县级机关
    设补习学校三百所四万工农干部入学
    一年来成绩显著创重要经验
    【新华社讯】华北各省、县级机关，开办在职干部业余文化补习学校的工作，一年来获得不少成绩，并创造出若干经验，可为进一步推广补习学校的参考。
    华北各省大量工农老干部，过去长期在战争中不能得到正规的学习和提高文化的机会。各省领导机关根据工作的需要和干部的迫切要求，特举办在职干部业余文化补习学校，采取系统的、正规的入校学习办法，来提高工农干部的文化、知识程度。经过一年来的努力，河北、平原、山西、察哈尔等四省的省级和专区和县级机关，已开办业余文化补习学校三百四十五所，入学干部（内有部分勤杂人员）共四万五千三百余人。
    各地文化补习学校一般都制订了正规的教学方针、学制和各种制度。各校都按学员程度划分为初小、高小、初中三部。计划在三年至五年的业余时间，使文化程度最低的干部，也能达到初中毕业的程度。如唐山市的教学进度计划是：初小部一年半毕业，高小部一年毕业，即以二年半时间，学完相当一般小学六年之主要课程；初中部则计划二年半毕业。课程以文化教育为主，政治与政策教育为辅。文化课目有国语、算术、自然、史地等课。各校都设有专人负责，并聘有专职和兼职教员，上课时数一般以每周十二小时的业余时间为准，并利用课外时间进行自修和复习。各校在开办过程中，并逐渐建立了点名、请假、评奖、测验、作业记分等制度，保证了教学的正规化。
    经过一年来较集中的正规化的学习，一般干部在文化上已有显著的提高。据唐山、保定等地的测验结果，原为文盲或稍识几个字的干部，一般已识到六、七百字，算术学会简单四则，有些并学会写简单的信件和报告。原来相当于初小程度的干部现在已经能写通顺的文字，并能给报纸写稿。部分干部已能比较正确地使用标点符号，算术也学会分数和比例。唐山高、初小部去年年终曾举行一次期考，参加的一千一百八十二人中，除八十人因公误课过多而留级外，其余都按级升入高小或初中部。学校并发给正式毕业证书，大大地鼓舞了干部的学习热情和信心。
