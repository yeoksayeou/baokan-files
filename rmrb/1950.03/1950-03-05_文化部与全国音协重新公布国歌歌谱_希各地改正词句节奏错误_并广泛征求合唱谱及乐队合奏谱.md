[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Musicians Association, noting discrepancies in the lyrics and rhythm of the national anthem ("March of the Volunteers") sung in various localities (such as "Everyone is forced to emit the final roar," "Forward, forward," etc.), deem it urgently necessary to unify them. Therefore, the sheet music of the national anthem is re-released, and music workers in various localities are urged to promptly correct any differences. Furthermore, because the orchestral arrangements used in different places are numerous, varied in quality, and in need of standardization, it has been decided to widely solicit choral and orchestral arrangements of the national anthem for selection and adoption. The solicitation methods are as follows: (1) The sheet music of the national anthem issued by the Ministry shall be the standard, and applicants may request it from the Arts Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government in Beijing by letter. (2) The types of submissions include: choral arrangements, wind band arrangements, orchestral arrangements, and piano accompaniment arrangements. (3) Deadline: The first deadline is the end of March, and the second deadline is the end of May. (4) Submission address: Arts Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, No. 5 Toutiao Hutong, Dongsi Pailou, Beijing. The top three entries, after evaluation, will receive awards.
