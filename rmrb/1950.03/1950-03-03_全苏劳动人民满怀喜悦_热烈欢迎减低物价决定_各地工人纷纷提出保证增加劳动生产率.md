　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd. Comprehensive TASS News: All Soviet working people welcome the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to further reduce the prices of food and manufactured goods with great satisfaction and joy. The Soviet people regard this resolution as a manifestation of the great Stalin's care for the working people, his concern for the improvement of their welfare and culture, and the prosperity of the entire country.

　　In Moscow, after listening to the radio broadcast, factories immediately held meetings. Borodina, a foreman at a light bulb factory, said: "It is a great fortune to live and work in this country. We enjoy a happy life thanks to the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party. On March 12, we will all vote for the candidates of the party and non-party alliance, which is to vote for the prosperity of the socialist motherland." Afanasyev, a senior foreman at the Stalin Automobile Factory, said at the meeting: "The fact that necessities of life are now being reduced in price for the third time is only possible in the Soviet Union." Workers at the Three Hills Textile Factory pledged to increase labor productivity in order to further reduce the cost of consumer goods.

　　The Kharkov Sickle and Hammer Factory, which is assembling a batch of new-style combined threshing machines, held a meeting. Gula, who completed three months' quota in February, said: "My team guarantees to complete 300% of the task." Myerslyak, a grinder at the Kiev Precision Instrument Factory, also made the same guarantee. Workers in the Donets industrial zone also made guarantees to increase production.

　　In Minsk, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno, and other cities in the Belorussian Republic, working people held meetings.

　　In the Baku oil fields, workers discussed the price reduction decision. Nimarula, a Stalin Prize winner and underwater oil well excavation worker, said: "This year, the income of underwater oil well workers will nearly double. We received large bonuses for bringing new oil wells into production quickly. As a foreman, I received 3,000 to 5,000 rubles. Now, due to the price reduction, my actual income will increase by more than 1,000 rubles per month."

　　In the Ugolnaya and Karaganda mines, in the Altai quarries, in the Imba oil fields, in Sverdlovsk, Kirov, Petrozavodsk, Vilnius, and many other regions of the Soviet Union, mass rallies were also held.

　　Soviet farmers welcomed the price reduction decision with the same enthusiasm. Telnov, chairman of the Ural Collective Farm, said: "On our collective farm, the production process has been completely electrified. The price reduction will make us even wealthier." Team leader Kozlova said: "After the price reduction, my income will increase by 20%."

　　全苏劳动人民满怀喜悦
    热烈欢迎减低物价决定     
    各地工人纷纷提出保证增加劳动生产率
    【新华社北京二日电】综合塔斯社消息：全苏联劳动人民以极大的满意和喜悦欢迎苏联部长会议及联共中央关于再次减低食品与制成品价格的决定。苏联人民把这个决议当作伟大的斯大林关怀劳动人民、关怀他们的福利与文化的增进以及整个国家的繁荣的表现。
    在莫斯科，人民听完了无线电广播之后，各工厂即刻举行集会。灯泡制造厂的领班波罗迪娜说：“生活和工作在这个国家里是极大的幸运。我们享受幸福的生活，要归功于苏维埃政府和布尔什维克党。到三月十二日，我们要全体投票选举党与非党联盟的候选人，也就是投票拥护社会主义祖国的繁荣。”斯大林汽车工厂的高级领班阿法那西也夫在会上说：“人民生活必需品现在实行第三次减价，这只有在苏联才有可能。”三山纺织厂的工人保证提高劳动生产率，以便消费品的成本更为减低。
    正在装配一批新型复式打禾机的哈尔科夫镰刀与铁锤工厂举行集会，在二月份完成了三个月定额的古拉说：“我的工作队保证完成任务百分之三百。”基辅精确仪器工厂的磨工麦尔斯里亚克也作了同样的保证。顿尼兹工业区的工人也作了增加生产的保证。
    在明斯克、文德比斯克、哥美尔、格罗德诺以及白俄罗斯共和国其他城市的劳动人民，均举行了会议。
    在巴库油田上，工人们纷纷讨论减价决定，斯大林奖金获得者、海底油井的挖掘工人尼马杜拉说：“今年，海底油井石油工人的收入，将近增加一倍。我们因使新的油井迅速出油而获得大笔奖金。我是一个领班，就得到了三千到五千卢布。现在，由于减价，我的实际收入每月将再增加一千余卢布。”
    在乌哥尔那雅、卡拉干达的矿坑，在阿尔泰的采石地，在伊姆巴的油田，在斯维德洛夫斯克、基格罗伏、彼得罗萨佛得斯克、维尔那以及苏联的其他许多地区，也都举行了群众大会。
    苏联农民以同样的热情来欢迎减价的决议。乌拉尔集体农场的主席铁尔诺夫说：“在我们的集体农场上，生产过程已完全电气化了，减价将使我们更为富裕。”工作队长科兹罗娃说：“减价之后，我的收入将增加百分之二十。”
