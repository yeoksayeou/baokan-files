　　A Good Experience in Production for Disaster Relief
    The Contract Method of the Qi County Cooperative in Pingyuan Province

    The Qi County Cooperative in Pingyuan Province has relatively good experience in establishing contracts, organizing material exchange between mountainous and plain areas, and promoting production. Its experience is introduced as follows:

    After the production movement began last winter, in order to vigorously organize material exchange between mountainous and plain areas and promote various kinds of mass production, the county cooperative, in cooperation with the county industry and commerce department and the bank, conducted surveys of the winter agricultural and sideline economic situation in various places in October. They studied the masses' supply and marketing demands and formulated specific plans for organizing production and exchanging materials. On February 18, the cooperative cadre meeting enthusiastically discussed the issue of organizing disaster victims for production. Thirty-two village cooperatives in the mountainous and plain areas immediately formulated production plans and signed exchange contracts. This opened up sales channels for mountain products, achieved mutual benefit, and greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of cooperative members. For example, in the plain area, only three village cooperatives organized 144 people and 99 livestock, earning more than 8,000 catties of rice.

    Under the influence of these actions, the production enthusiasm of villages without cooperatives and non-members was greatly promoted. They requested material exchange and organization, laying the foundation for establishing cooperatives. Now, material exchange between mountainous and plain areas has become a movement. Its experience is:

    1. Concrete organizational leadership and the mobilization of the masses for mutual assistance and mutual aid to overcome difficulties are essential for good production.

    2. Educating the masses with the practical benefits of organized production further enhances their awareness, develops cooperatives, and promotes the contract system.

    3. Preliminary investigation and statistical work are very important. Understanding the supply and marketing situation of the masses and formulating plans based on the situation ensures that production is not blind. At the same time, this period of production clarified the great role of using economic means to lead the economy and village cooperatives to organize production for the cadres.

    4. Organizing material exchange between mountainous and plain areas, establishing contracts, and developing rural credit lending stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for production and building cooperatives, and also opened up avenues for village cooperatives. It also broke down sectarian ideas between mountainous and plain areas, promoted the class sentiment that farmers all over the world are one family, and strengthened unity.

　　一个生产救灾好经验
    平原省淇县合作社订合同的办法
    平原省淇县合作社订立合同，组织山地、平原物资交流，推动生产，其经验是比较好的。兹介绍其经验如下：
    去冬生产运动开始后，该县合作社为了大力组织山地、平原物资交流，推动群众各种各样的生产，在十月间即配合县工商科与银行，分头到各地作了冬季农、副业经济情况调查，研究了群众的供销要求，订出组织生产与交流物资的具体计划。二月十八日合作干部会议上热烈讨论了组织灾民生产问题，当即有山地与平原三十二个村社订出组织生产计划，并订定了交换合同。这样打开了山货销路，达到了调剂有无，大大刺激了社员生产情绪。如平地仅三个村社即已组织起一百四十四人，九十九头牲口，赚米八千余斤。
    在这样行动影响下，大大推动了没社村与非社员的生产情绪，纷纷要求物资交换和组织起来，打下了建社基础。现在山地平原物资交换形成运动。其经验是：
    一、必须有具体的组织领导，并发动群众互助互济，克服困难，生产才会搞好。
    二、以组织起来生产的实利教育群众，进一步提高群众觉悟，发展合作社，发扬合同制。
    三、事先调查统计工作很重要。了解群众的供销情况，根据情况订出计划，组织生产才不盲目。同时经过这段生产，使干部明确了以经济领导经济、以村社组织生产的伟大作用。
    四、组织山地平原物资交流，订立合同，开展农村信用借贷，刺激了群众生产与建社热情，也给村社开辟了道路；并打破了山地平原的宗派思想，发扬了天下农民是一家的阶级情感，加强了团结。
