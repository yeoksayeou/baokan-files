　　“The Stalin Party and Non-Party League”
    Q: In the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections reported a few days ago, the phrase "Stalin Party and Non-Party League" was frequently mentioned. What kind of organization is this within the election process? (Jin Jie)
    A: The "Party and Non-Party League" frequently mentioned in the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections is not an organization.
    In the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections, candidates are nominated through joint meetings of Communist Party members and non-Party workers, farmers, and intellectuals convened by factories, collective farms, universities, and government organs. Each Communist Party candidate for Supreme Soviet representative is simultaneously a candidate of the non-Party masses; each non-Party candidate of the masses is also simultaneously a candidate of the Communist Party. Hence, these candidates are referred to as "candidates of the Party and Non-Party League." The Party and Non-Party League is not simply an electoral agreement (like the various parties of the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries during elections), but a political alliance between the Communist Party and the entire mass of the people. The connection between the Communist Party and the people has always been close. The Soviet Communist Party leads all the people of the Soviet Union, advancing together with the people. By 1937, the economic and political transformation and construction of the Soviet Union had reached a new stage, and the political thought of the Soviet people had reached an unprecedented level of harmony and unity. The connection between the Communist Party and the people became even closer, and the idea of the Party and Non-Party League fully matured, becoming the foundation of the election movement and a powerful force for mobilizing all the people of the Soviet Union to participate in political life. This alliance is named the "Stalin Party and Non-Party League" because the Soviet people all believe that their unprecedented rise in welfare and the creation and prosperity of the socialist state are closely related to the name of Stalin; they nominated Stalin as the first candidate of the entire people for representative to the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

　　“斯大林党与非党联盟”
    问：在前几天登载的苏联最高苏维埃选举中，常常提到“斯大林党与非党联盟”，这是在选举当中怎么样的一种组织？（金颉）
    答：苏联最高苏维埃选举中常提到的“党与非党联盟”并不是一种组织。
    在苏联最高苏维埃选举中，候选人是由工厂、集体农场、大学、机关所召集的共产党员和非党工人、农民、知识分子的共同会议而提出的。最高苏维埃代表的每个共产党候选人同时是非党群众的候选人；每个非党群众候选人同时也是共产党的候选人。因之称这些候选人为“党与非党联盟的候选人”。党与非党联盟也不是简单的选举协定（如资本主义国家资产阶级的各色各样的政党在选举中的那种协定），而是共产党与全体人民群众的政治上的联盟。共产党和人民的联系，从来就是密切的。苏联共产党领导全苏人民，和人民一同前进；到了一九三七年，苏联在经济上、政治上的改造与建设达到了新的阶段，苏联人民政治思想达到了空前的和谐一致。共产党和人民的联系更加密切，党与非党联盟的思想就完全成熟，成为选举运动的基础，成为动员全苏人民参加政治生活的强大力量。把这个联盟名之为“斯大林党与非党联盟”，是因为苏联人民都认为他们的福利的空前高涨，社会主义国家的创立和繁荣，都与斯大林的名字有密切关联；他们推举斯大林为苏联最高苏维埃代表的全民的第一位候选人。
