　　Chahar Province Federation of Trade Unions Instructs Mine Unions to Strengthen Security and Strictly Prevent Accidents
    [This newspaper reported] According to the Chahar Daily on the 18th: Over 90% of the coal mines in Chahar Province rely on natural ventilation. With the arrival of spring, the ground temperature rises, and it is understood that 122 mines with fire and many mines with gas are likely to experience fires. At the same time, the tunnel roofs are mostly substandard and dilapidated; after the ground thaws, the pressure increases, creating a significant possibility of collapse. The Chahar Province Federation of Trade Unions has once again instructed trade union cadres at all levels to deeply mobilize the masses and urge the administration to conscientiously inspect and improve safety equipment to complete this year's production tasks.

    First, trade unions should convene worker representative meetings or various forms of meetings to implement the spirit of "safety first" and democratic management. This should enable all employees to fully recognize the importance of safety and improve workers' safety knowledge. Mobilize all employees to actively inspect safety conditions. Suggest, assist, and urge the administration to improve safety equipment, and make it a mass movement, and establish confidence in avoiding accidents. Trade unions should establish safety committees to be specifically responsible for various safety-related matters.

    Second, trade union cadres working in coal mines must be familiar with their duties, understand safety knowledge, deeply understand the situation, and study improvement methods. The current focus is on improving ventilation equipment and removing ventilation obstacles. If the methane concentration rises to 1.5% or higher, work should be prohibited, and work should resume after strengthening ventilation to reduce the methane concentration. Check the roof and reinforce the roof supports. Firewalls should be added to tunnels with natural fire; tunnels with nitric oxide should also be ventilated or blocked with walls.

    Third, it is suggested that the administrative departments of each coal mine organize a safety inspection. A safety inspection committee should be organized by the Party, the administration, the trade union, and worker representatives to actively take action, inspect and improve simultaneously, strengthen the sense of responsibility, establish a responsibility system, overcome our bureaucracy and focus on routine matters, emphasize consistent steps, cooperate with each other, grasp the center, solve problems, and strive to complete the task of safe production.

　　察省总工会指示各矿山工会
    加强保安严防事故
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报十八日消息：察省煤矿有百分之九十以上是依靠自然通风。目前春天到来，地气上升，据了解的一百二十二个有火的井和许多有沼气的井，均有可能爆发火灾。同时坑道顶板也多不合规格，老朽不堪；地消之后，压力加重，大有陷塌的可能。察省总工会特再度指示各级工会干部应深入发动群众，督促行政认真检查改善保安设备，完成今年生产任务。
    首先工会要召开工人代表会或各种形式的会议，贯彻安全第一与民主管理的精神。使全体职工充分认识到安全的重要意义，提高工人保安常识。动员全体职工积极行动起来检查保安情况。建议、协助、督促行政改善保安设备，并使之成为群众性的运动，并应树立避免事故发生的信心。工会在组织上应设保安委员，专门负责各项有关保安事项。
    第二，在煤矿工作的工会干部，必须熟悉业务，懂得保安知识，深入了解情况，研究改进方法。目前重点是改善通风设备，清除通风障碍，如沼气存有量升至百分之一点五以上时即应禁止工作，待加强通风使沼气减少后复工。检查顶板，加粗顶木。存自然火的坑道应加修防火墙；有一氧化氮的也应通风或堵墙。
    第三，建议各煤矿行政上组织一次安全检查。由党、政、工及工人代表组织安全检查委员会，积极行动起来，一面检查、一面改进，加强责任心，树立责任制，克服我们的官僚主义、事务主义，强调步调一致，互相配合，抓住中心，解决问题，为完成安全生产的任务而奋斗。
