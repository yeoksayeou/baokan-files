What "Human Rights" Do the American People Enjoy?
    Yang Hua
    Despite the propaganda of the American imperialists boasting about American "democracy," despite Truman's renewed proposal in this year's "State of the Union Address" to pass legislation "protecting" human rights; what "democracy" do the American people actually enjoy? What kind of so-called "protection" are American "human rights" receiving? The following facts will give people a sober answer—in an increasingly fascist America, the people have no democracy, and their human rights are constantly trampled upon by the monopoly capitalists and their pawns.
    In the courtroom, eleven American Communist leaders were subjected to unwarranted trials in October of last year because of their beliefs. Not only that, but the lawyers who defended the eleven American Communist leaders were also charged with "contempt of court." In November of last year, Harry Bridges, the leader of the longshoremen on the American West Coast, was tried on trumped-up charges. His defense lawyer was sentenced to six months in prison, again on the charge of "contempt of court." Recently, six Black people in New Jersey were unreasonably sentenced to death by the court. Only after strong protests from progressive groups and the people across the country did the higher court overturn the original sentence and order a retrial. However, Judge Hutchinson did not allow the three lawyers who originally defended these six Black people to defend the defendants again, saying that they had violated the professional ethics of lawyers. According to the reactionary rulers' interpretation, this professional ethic is probably not to allow defense for Black people! Logue, one of these three lawyers, said: "If a defense lawyer is convicted, then whoever goes to court to defend a defendant who is considered a heretic will lose his freedom along with the person he defends." He pointed out that the reason the court does not allow the defendant to choose his own defense lawyer is because the reactionary rulers "dare not conduct a trial when a competent defense lawyer appears in court to defend the defendant." Originally, in the United States, the court is not a place to try bad people but to try good people, and the law is not a tool to protect people's rights but to deprive them of their rights.
    In the cultural and artistic circles, the reactionary rulers' black hands are also grabbing anyone they consider ideologically left-leaning and bringing them to court for questioning. The House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed ten Hollywood screenwriters and asked them: "Are you communists, were you in the past?" The ten respondents refused to answer this question because it violated the freedom of political belief granted to them by the American Constitution. So they were charged with refusing to answer. They are now raising money in various places so that they can afford to appeal to the Supreme Court. Screenwriter Cole delivered a speech in Cleveland, Ohio, saying: "Today, people are being spied on and monitored in companies, in offices, and in their homes. Their phones are being tapped, and their children are being bullied in schools. There is no atmosphere here in which freedom of speech can exist and develop." He also said: "In this atmosphere of moral decline, people say they are not communists for fear of being interrogated as heretics, hoping that violence will be directed at others, and trying to protect themselves by doing so. Such a person is a fool and a coward, and I believe I am not a fool, and I pray that I will never be a coward." Who are the people who are interrogating these innocent people? - The chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee, Thompson, is a publicly recognized criminal, a criminal who was sentenced to prison by the court for committing corruption and bribery.
    In schools, progressive professors are being persecuted. Before former psychology Ph.D. Davis came to the University of California to give a speech on racial discrimination, the university wanted him to prove that he was not a communist. Provost Hahn said: "His political beliefs are questionable," but Hahn could not produce any evidence. Still at this university, a young physics lecturer, Fuchs, who had participated in the development of the atomic bomb, was asked by the Un-American Activities Committee in September of last year, "Are you a communist?" He refused to answer, and was then dismissed by the school, on the grounds that he did not meet the minimum requirements for teachers, but in fact he had been a teacher at the school as early as 1946.
    In trade union organizations, the reactionary ruling class is using its lackeys—reactionary union scabs—to instigate the exclusion and persecution of progressive unions. Last year, the right-wing leaders of the CIO expelled two progressive unions—the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America and the Farm Equipment Workers Organizing Committee—and are continuing to expel other progressive unions, such as the United Public Workers of America. When interrogating this union, the union was not allowed to hire lawyers and witnesses, and they were not allowed to question the false statements of the accusers. These false accusations really could not stand up to questioning. One of them said that the union's newspaper published a letter in 1940 from an American soldier stationed at Fort Dix, saying that it felt very cold in the barracks there. This was considered evidence of conspiring with the Communist Party to slander and undermine the American armed forces.
    For the Communist Party, the reactionary rulers are relentlessly launching fierce and malicious attacks. A few days ago, on March 4, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, the main contents of which include: "Requires all communists and communist front organizations to register," "Prohibits communists from holding government office or applying for American passports," "Requires all communist propaganda mailed or broadcast by radio to be marked"... .... The reactionary ruling class is only one step away from openly declaring the Communist Party illegal.
    This is the "human rights" that the American people enjoy today!

### 美国人民享有什么“人权”？

　　美国人民享有什么“人权”？
    杨华
    尽管美帝国主义的宣传家如何吹嘘着美国的“民主”，尽管杜鲁门在今年的“国情咨文”中如何再度提出要通过“保护”人权的法案；但美国人民究竟享受了什么“民主”？美国的“人权”是受着什么样的所谓“保护”？下面的事实会给人们一个清醒的答复——日益法西斯化的美国中的民众没有民主，民众的人权不断遭受着独占资本家及其爪牙们的蹂躏。
    在法庭上，十一位美共领袖，于去年十月间，因他们的信仰而遭受着无理的审讯。不仅如此，为十一位美共领袖辩护的律师也被控以“藐视法庭”之罪。去年十一月间，美国西海岸的码头工人领袖布利治被控“莫须有”之罪而受审。他的辩护律师则被判以六个月的徒刑，罪名又是“藐视法庭”。最近新泽西州有六个黑人被法庭无理地判处死刑，后因全国进步团体和人民的极力抗议，才由上级法庭撤回原判，予以重审。但原为这六个黑人辩护的三位律师，法官霍琴逊不许其再为被告辩护，说他们违背了律师的职业道德。这种职业道德，依照反动统治者的解释，也许就是不许为黑人辩护吧！洛格是这三个律师中的一个，他说：“假使辩护律师被判有罪的话，那么谁到法庭上去为一个被视为异端的犯人辩护，就与他所辩护的人一起失去其自由。”他指出：法庭之所以不允许被告选择自己的辩护律师，是因为反动统治者“不敢在力能称职的辩护律师出庭为被告辩护时进行审判”。本来，在美国，法庭不是审讯坏人而是审讯好人的地方，法律不是保护人民权利而是剥夺人民权利的工具。
    在文化艺术界里，反动统治者的黑手也在把任何他们认为思想左倾的人抓到法庭上来审问。众院非美活动委员会传讯了十个好莱坞的电影剧本作者，问他们：“你们是不是共产党，过去是不是？”十个受审者拒绝回答这个问题，因为这侵犯了美国宪法所给予他们的政治信仰的自由。于是他们被控以拒绝回答之罪。他们现在正在各地募款，以便有钱向最高法院上诉。电影剧本作者考尔在俄亥俄州的克利夫兰发表演说道：“今天，人们在公司里，在办公室里，在他们的家里都受着侦察和监视。他们的电话被人偷听，他们的孩子在学校里受着欺侮。这里已没有使言论自由得以存在和发展的那种气氛。”他又说：“在这种道德低落的气氛中，因怕被当为异端审问，乃说他不是一个共产党人，希望暴力朝向别人打去，企图借此自保。这样的人是一蠢人，也是一懦夫，我相信我不是一个蠢人，也祈祷我永远不是一个懦夫。”审讯这些无辜者的是什么人呢？——非美活动委员会的主席，汤姆逊，他是人民公认的罪人，因犯了贪污舞弊的罪而被法庭判了徒刑的犯人。
    在学校里，进步教授受着迫害，加里福利亚大学，要前心理学博士戴维斯在来校作关于种族歧视的演讲之前，证明他不是共产党员。教务长汉恩说：“他的政治信仰是有问题的”，但汉恩却拿不出任何的证据。还是在这个大学里，一位青年物理学讲师福克斯曾经参预发展原子弹，去年九月被非美活动委员会的询问他“是不是共产党？”他拒绝了回答，于是便被学校解聘了，理由是：他不具备教员的最低条件，而事实上早在一九四六年他便是该校的教员了。
    在工会组织中，反动统治阶级则利用其走狗——反动的工贼们策动着对进步工会的排挤和迫害。去年产联的右翼领导者开除了两个进步工会——电气工人工会和农业器材工会，还在继续开除其他的进步工会，如美国公务员及自由职业者工会。在审讯这个工会时不许这个工会聘请律师和证人，不许他们对控告者的诬言予以质询。这种诬告的言词也的确是经不起质询，其中之一是说，这个工会的报纸在一九四○年登载了一封驻在迪克斯要塞的美国兵士写的信，这封信说：住在那里的兵营中感觉得很冷。这便被认为是一件与共产党同谋，诋毁、破坏美国武装部队的罪证。
    对于共产党，反动统治者更是毫不放松地发动凶狠恶毒的进攻，十几天以前，三月四日，参院司法委员会通过了蒙特反共法案，其内容举其要者即有：“规定一切共产党员与共产党阵线的组织必须登记”，“禁止共产党员担任政府职员或申请美国护照”，“规定一切邮寄或经由电台广播的共产党宣传必须加上记号”………。反动统治阶级只差公然宣布共产党非法。
    这就是美国人民今天所享有的“人权”！
