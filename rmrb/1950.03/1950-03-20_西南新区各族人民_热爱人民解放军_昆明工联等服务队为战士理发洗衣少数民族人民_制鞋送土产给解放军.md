Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 19th: In the newly liberated areas of the Southwest, people of all nationalities warmly welcome and love the People's Liberation Army. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army also respond to the enthusiastic support of the people by actively cherishing and helping them. The citizens of Kunming voluntarily help the troops solve their difficulties. The Federation of Trade Unions, the Student Union and other organizations have organized six service teams to go to the troops'驻地 (zhùdì, garrison) to provide haircuts, mending, and laundry for the soldiers. Farmers bring firewood from dozens of miles away to give to the People's Liberation Army. Workers from the cart drivers' union compete to transport goods for the People's Liberation Army. In the Yuanjiang area of ​​southern Yunnan, when the People's Liberation Army was encircling and annihilating remnants of bandits, ethnic minorities voluntarily took out grain to assist the People's Liberation Army in searching for "Old Yellow Dogs" (their term for the Chiang bandit troops). When the People's Liberation Army arrived in Malipo, southern Yunnan, the local Yao people rushed to make more than a thousand pairs of cloth shoes to give to the soldiers, even though they were not very good at making cloth shoes. When the ethnic minorities in southern Yunnan heard that the People's Liberation Army had arrived, they brought baskets full of local products from the deep mountains to give to the People's Liberation Army. In Songpan County, northwestern Sichuan, ethnic minorities did not dare to bring goods into the city to trade during the period when the Kuomintang bandit gangs were entrenched. When they heard that the People's Liberation Army had entered the city, they immediately brought firewood, grain, and meat into the city in large quantities to sell. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in various places, in order to respond to the enthusiasm of the people, also showed more love and care for the people. After the troops were stationed in Kunming, they immediately cleaned up the驻地 (zhùdì, garrison); in order to prevent the white walls in the houses from being blackened by smoke, some units built stoves at the foot of the wall in the courtyard; the keepers were afraid that the livestock would damage the trees, so they wrapped the tree trunks with oilcloth; the troops who borrowed 民房 (mínfáng, civilian housing) cleaned the landlord's house very cleanly every day and helped the landlord carry water. The commanders and fighters of each unit rarely ask for leave to go out except for official business, and work hard to study when they are free. On the 9th of this month, the troops stationed in Kunming held a get-together with the citizens, and the troops' cultural troupes performed Yangko operas, movies, dramas, and picture exhibitions in ten areas of the city. Yi women from dozens of miles away also rushed into the city to participate. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Songpan strictly respects the living habits of ethnic minorities, and invites their representatives and 土司 (tǔsī, hereditary headmen) to participate in discussions. At the meeting, in addition to explaining the people's government's ethnic policies, they also sincerely solicit their opinions on the People's Liberation Army. At the symposium, the representatives unanimously indignantly accused Chiang bandits of atrocities. They said: "We have a saying here, "Good people don't come to the frontier, and there are no good people on the frontier," but the arrival of the People's Liberation Army has completely changed our view. The People's Liberation Army is the best army we have ever seen."

    【新华社重庆十九日电】西南新解放区各地各族人民，热烈地欢迎和爱戴人民解放军，人民解放军的指战员们也用积极爱护和帮助群众来回答广大人民的热情盛意。昆明的市民们自动帮助部队解决困难，工联、学联等团体组织了六个服务队，分赴部队驻地为战士们理发、缝补和洗衣。农民们从几十里外砍了柴送来给解放军。马车工会的工人们争先恐后地为解放军运输物品。云南南部元江地区的少数民族，在人民解放军围歼残匪时，自动地拿出粮食来，协助人民解放军搜查“老黄狗”（他们对蒋匪军的称呼）。人民解放军进抵滇南马立坡时，当地的瑶民赶做了千多双布鞋送给战士们，他们本来是不大会做布鞋的。滇南的少数民族人民听说人民解放军到了，纷纷从各处的深山里，背了满筐的土产送给解放军。川西北松潘县的少数民族人民，在国民党匪帮盘踞时期，是不敢背东西进城做买卖的，当他们听说人民解放军进了城，他们马上将木柴、粮食、肉大批地背进城来卖。各地的人民解放军的指战员们为了回答人民群众的热情，也对人民加倍爱护和关心。部队进驻昆明后，立即把驻地打扫得干干净净；为了怕把屋子里的白墙薰黑了，有些单位在院子里的墙脚下打灶；饲养员们怕牲口把树啃坏了，用油布把树干包起来；借住民房的部队，天天把房东家打扫得非常清洁，而且帮房东挑水。各部队指战员除因公外，很少请假外出，一空下来就努力学习。本月九日，驻昆明部队与市民举行联欢，部队文工团分别在市内十个地区演出秧歌剧、电影、话剧和展览图片。远在几十里路外的彝族妇女也赶进城来参加。驻在松潘的人民解放军，严格地尊重少数民族的生活习惯，并且邀约他们的代表、土司等座谈，会上除讲解人民政府的民族政策外，并诚恳地征求他们对人民解放军的意见。座谈会上代表们一致愤慨地控诉蒋匪暴行，他们说：“我们这里有句俗话，“好人不来边，来边无好人”，可是解放军来了，就完全改变了我们这种看法了。解放军是我们从来没有见过的好部队。”
