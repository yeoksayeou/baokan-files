　　Peasants in the Suburbs of Beijing's Fourteenth District, Having Overthrown the Landlords, Deliver Manure and Plow the Land in Preparation for Spring Planting

　　[Our Newspaper] The peasants in the Fourteenth District of Beijing's suburbs, who have overthrown the landlords, are actively accumulating fertilizer, plowing the land, and delivering manure in preparation for spring planting. Peasants in Xiaohongmen, Paifang, Madao, and Shiba Lichang villages are hauling black soil from the city as fertilizer this year, exceeding the quantity of previous years. Some peasants in Shiba Lichang are applying three cartloads of manure per mu of land. Currently, most peasants in various villages have started collecting and transporting manure from their pens. Peasants in Xinkailu have spontaneously initiated mutual aid, with those who have livestock and carts helping those who do not to transport manure. In Nanyangzhuang, most of the land was plowed before the New Year. Most peasants are preparing to sow early-maturing crops. The District Production Committee has recently transferred twelve cadres, forming three groups, responsible for leading production work and going deep into villages and households to mobilize peasants to dig wells and repair old ones. In addition, the District River Works Committee is preparing to use work relief to open canals and dig rivers. It has now organized 4,055 male laborers, 155 female laborers, and 90 elderly and weak laborers from nineteen villages. Work is expected to begin in mid-March.
