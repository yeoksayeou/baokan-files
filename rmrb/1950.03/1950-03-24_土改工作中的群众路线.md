　　The Mass Line in Land Reform Work
　　Professor Feng Youlan, Tsinghua University

　　Note: Professor Feng Youlan of the Philosophy Department of Tsinghua University participated in land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing with more than 200 teachers and students from Tsinghua University during the winter vacation. He worked in the countryside for a month and a half and returned to school at the beginning of this month. This article was written after his return to school.

　　Land reform work is carried out on the basis of administrative villages. In the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing, each administrative village has a land reform work team to lead the land reform work. Each administrative village includes several natural villages, with hundreds of households. Although the area is not too large and the number of people is not too many, there are still many things that are not easy to handle in land reform work.

　　For example, when it comes to distributing the fruits of victory, there are many things that are not easy to handle. The fruits of victory include land, farm tools, houses, and carts and horses. According to the land reform policy in the suburbs, the land of landlords and the land leased by rich peasants are confiscated by the state, but the original tenants still cultivate as before, and the government issues them land use certificates to continue using the land. Therefore, each administrative village has only a small amount of land that can actually be used to adjust for poor peasants and farm laborers. For example, Zhangyi Village in the northwest of Fengtai has 204 households, 968 people, and a total of 2,985 mu of land. The fruits of victory that can actually be distributed to poor peasants and farm laborers are 350 mu of land, 444 farm tools, 6 carts, 8 livestock, and 33 houses. Lugouqiao has more population than Zhangyi Village, and the fruits of victory that can actually be distributed to poor peasants and farm laborers are 250 mu of land, 622 farm tools, 7 carts, and 13 livestock.

　　Because there are many people and not many fruits of victory, the policy stipulates that instead of using the method of equal distribution, the method of adjustment is used. Land and farm tools are given according to the actual needs of individual poor peasants and farm laborers. Whether to give and how much to give depends entirely on the actual needs of individual poor peasants and farm laborers. For those of us who have not followed the mass line, we feel that this method is really difficult to implement. How can the few people in the work team know which of the many poor peasants and farm laborers really needs land and who really knows how to farm? Moreover, when adjusting land and farm tools, the land and houses are good and bad, far and near, and the farm tools are also good and bad. Disputes can arise at any time regarding this type of issue.

　　However, such problems are not difficult to solve by relying on the masses. In the month and a half of participating in land reform work, I began to understand what it means to follow the mass line, and also learned a little about how to follow the mass line.

　　Originally, most of the land reform work was done by the peasants themselves. The task of the work team is to organize them and raise their class consciousness. In the terminology of the work team, it is to "organize the team and review the team." After the team is organized, with activists as the backbone, things are done by the team. The work team only needs to grasp the policies, and when it sees that the team is not energetic enough, it must find ways to encourage it. Sometimes it goes too far, and it must find ways to pull it back. It is like a helmsman on a boat, only responsible for setting the direction of the boat, as for the boat's movement, it depends on the masses.

　　The masses use a wonderful method to classify classes and distribute the fruits of victory, which is "self-reporting and public discussion." All people related to land attend the class classification conference. First, let the people who own land self-report the land, houses, carts, livestock, and the total population of the family they own. Start reporting from 1946. Every time an item is reported, the chairman asks: "Is what he said correct?" Only when the people present think it is correct, can the second item be carried out. If someone thinks that what he reported is incorrect, the chairman will shout: "Those who understand his situation, speak up!" After the report is completed, he is allowed to self-report his class composition. Then the conference will evaluate. The class composition of some people is very obvious, and there is no need for debate, but there are also those who self-report high and are evaluated low, and there are also those who self-report low and are evaluated high. After the masses evaluate, the farmers' association will issue the first list, which writes the feudal landlords, so many households of operational landlords, so many households of rich peasants, so many households of middle peasants, so many households of poor peasants, and so many households of tenant farmers. In the suburbs, the class composition must be approved by the district government before the final list can be issued and become a final decision.

　　After the final list comes out, who is the landlord has been decided. Then the land surveying team of the farmers' association will measure his land. Surveying is a troublesome thing, but there are many people among the peasants who can write and calculate. At the same time, the landlord is called in, and the number and types of his farm tools are determined by means of self-reporting and public discussion.

　　Immediately following is the confiscation of farm tools. Our work team handed over several large guns to the people of the farmers' association to carry. Cadres of the farmers' association, young cadres, women cadres, and people from the work team all went to the landlord's house. First, the peasants holding guns guarded the gate, and then the landlord was called out and asked where the farm tools were. The people who went there all started to work together, moved the farm tools out, placed them in the yard, registered them by the registration team of the farmers' association, and then the transportation team of the farmers' association put them on the landlord's cart and pulled them back to the work team (which is also the office of the farmers' association). This is the peak of overthrowing feudalism.

　　Of course, in the current situation, the landlord has no possibility of resistance, and the peasants carrying guns generally only have symbolic significance. But the fact that it symbolizes is great, that is, the proletarian Communist Party armed the peasants to overthrow the two-thousand-year-old feudal land system.

　　The following is the distribution of land and farm tools. At this time, the problems mentioned above are encountered. The solution to these problems is still self-reporting and public discussion. First, the peasants who need land and farm tools self-report in each group how many mu of land and how many pieces of farm tools they need. Those of us who have no experience are worried when we see the lists sent by each group, because the numbers on the lists are much larger than the actual land that can be adjusted and the number of farm tools confiscated. However, after holding a meeting for public discussion, there is still a surplus of land and farm tools. This is the case in Zhangyi Village, and it is also the case in Lugouqiao. The remaining things are redistributed, but from this, the effectiveness of public discussion can be seen.

　　During the public discussion, the groups of the farmers' association gathered in a corner of the venue. The chairman read the names one by one according to the self-reported lists. When a person's name is read, everyone should see whether he needs land, and whether he has the labor force to cultivate the land if he has land. Is the number of mu he wants too much or too little. Some people's self-reporting is obviously very reasonable. The chairman shouted: "So-and-so wants so many mu of land, do you agree or disagree?" The following shouted in unison, agreed, and this was passed. When there is something that can be debated, the chairman asks each group to discuss it separately. After a few minutes, the group leader reports: "My group agrees to give him so much," or "does not give him." If the opinions of each group are still inconsistent, the chairman shouts: "Those who understand the situation of so-and-so, speak up!" When the opinions of each group are almost the same, the chairman shouts: "Each group agrees to give him so many mu, do you agree or disagree?" The following shouted in unison, agreed, and this was passed.

　　The distribution of farm tools is also done through this method of public discussion, and assigning a certain person to get that piece of land is also done in this way. Of course, this method is very time-consuming; it requires meetings for several days in a row, and each meeting takes four or five hours, but it can really solve the problem.

　　A classmate who participated in land reform work with me said: Three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang. The magic lies in the word "make", cobblers can't do it separately, but together, you have a little meaning, I have a little meaning, put together, it is a complete meaning. I said: The method of self-reporting and public discussion is really good, I don't know who invented it. That classmate said: Of course, it was invented by the masses, it was still invented by the cobblers.

　　土改工作中的群众路线
    清华大学教授  冯友兰
    按：清华大学哲学系冯友兰教授，曾于寒假期间和清华师生二百余人参加京郊土地改革工作；在乡下工作了一个半月，本月初旬返校。本文是他返校后所写。
    土改工作是以行政村为单位进行的。在京郊土改工作中，每一个行政村有一个土改工作组领导土改工作。每一个行政村包括几个自然村，几百户人口。虽然地域不算太大，人也不算太多，但是在土改工作中，也有很多不容易办的事。
    譬如就分胜利果实说，其中就有许多不容易办的事。胜利果实包括土地、农具、房子、车马。按郊区的土改政策，地主的土地及富农出租的土地，没收为国有，但是原来的佃户，还是原耕不动，由政府发给他们土地使用证，继续使用。所以每一行政村，就只有少数土地可以实际拿来调剂贫农雇农。例如丰台西北的张仪村有二百零四户，九百六十八人，共占有土地两千九百八十五亩。实际可分配给贫雇农的胜利果实是地三百五十亩，农具四百四十四件，大车六辆，牲口八头，房子三十三间。芦沟桥人口比张仪村多，实际可分配给贫雇农的胜利果实，是地二百五十亩，农具六百二十二件，大车七辆，牲口十三头。
    因为人多而胜利果实不多，所以政策规定，不用平分的办法，而用调剂的办法。照着个别贫雇农的实际需要，而给他土地农具，给不给及给多少完全视个别的贫雇农的实际需要而定。在我们没有走过群众路线的人，觉得这个办法，实行起来，可真是困难极了。专凭工作组的几个人，怎么能够知道，在许多贫雇农中，谁果真需要地，谁果真会种地。而且在调剂土地农具的时候，土地房子有好有坏，有远有近，农具也有好有坏。关于这一类的问题，随时都可以发生争执。
    但，诸如此类的问题，倚靠群众是不难解决的。在参加土改工作的一个半月中，我开始了解怎样是走群众路线，并且也学了一点怎样走群众路线。
    原来土改工作，大部分都是农民自己办的。工作组的任务，是组织他们，提高他们的阶级觉悟。用工作组的术语说，就是“组织队伍，检阅队伍”。队伍组织成以后，有了积极分子作了骨干，事情就由队伍去干了。工作组只要把握政策，看见队伍气不足的时候，就要设法鼓励。有时太过火了，就要设法拉回。好像一个船上掌舵的人，只管把定船的方向，至于船走，就要靠群众了。
    群众划分阶级，分胜利果实，都用一个妙法，就是“自报公议”。在划阶级的大会上，凡是与土地有关的人都出席。先让有土地的人自报他所占有的土地、房子、大车、牲口，以及全家人口等等。从民国三十五年报起。每报一项，主席就问：“他说的对不对呀。”总须到会的人认为不错，才进行第二项。若果有人认为他报的不对，主席就喊：“了解他的情况的人都说话呀。”如是报完以后就让他自报他的阶级成份。然后大会评定。有些人的阶级成份是很明显的，用不着争论，但是也有自报的高而评定的低的，也有自报的低，而评定的高的。群众评定以后就由农会出第一榜，上写封建地主某某若干户，经营地主某某若干户，富农某某若干户，中农某某若干户，贫农某某若干户，佃农某某若干户。在郊区，阶级成份须经区政府批准，方出最后一榜，成为定案。
    最后的一榜出来后，谁是地主，已经决定了。就由农会的清丈组去丈量他的土地。丈量是一件麻烦的事，可是农民中能写会算的也大有其人。一面又叫地主来，用自报公议的办法，决定他的农具的数目种类。
    紧接着就是没收农具。我们工作组有几枝大枪交与农会的人带着，农会干部，青年干部，妇女干部，以及工作组的人，都去到地主家里，先由持枪的农民，把守大门，然后将地主叫出，喝问农具在什么地方。去的人一齐动手，将农具搬出，摆在院中，由农会的登记组登记以后，由农会的搬运组套上地主的大车，拉回工作组（也就是农会办公的地方）。这是打倒封建的最高峰。
    当然在现在情形下，地主没有反抗的可能，农民带枪，一般只有象征的意义。但是所象征的事实，是伟大的，就是，无产阶级的共产党武装了农民打倒二千年的封建土地制度。
    以下就是分配土地及农具。这时就遇见上面所说的那些问题了。解决这些问题的办法，还是自报公议。先是由需要土地农具的农民在各小组自报需要土地若干亩，什么样的农具若干件。我们没有经验的人，看见各小组送来的单子，都直发愁，因为各单子所开的数字，比实际可以调剂的土地，及没收来的农具数字大得多。可是经过开会公议以后，土地及农具，都还有余剩。在张仪村是如此，在芦沟桥也是如此。剩余的东西，还是再分，不过于此可见公议的效力。
    在公议的时候，农会的各小组都各在会场一个角落里聚齐。主席照着自报的单子，一名一名的念。念到一个人，就要大家看他是否需要地，有地他是否有劳动力能种。他要的亩数，是否太多或太少。有些人的自报，显然是很合理的。主席就喊：“某某人要几亩地，你们同意不同意呀！”下面齐喊，同意，这就通过了。在有可以争论的时候主席就叫各小组各自讨论。经过几分钟后，小组长报告：“我这一组同意给他多少，”或是“不给他”。如果各小组的意见还不一致，主席就喊：“了解某某人的情况的人，都说话呀！”等到各小组的意见差不多时，主席就喊：“各小组同意给他若干亩，你们同意不同意呀！”下面齐喊同意，这就通过了。
    分配农具，也是经过这种公议的办法，指定某人得到那一块地，也是若这一种办法，当然这种办法是很费时候；需要一连几天的开会，每会都要四五个钟头，不过可真能解决问题。
    有个同我一起参加土改工作的同学说：三个臭皮匠凑成一个诸葛亮。妙处在一个凑字，臭皮匠分开都不行，可是在一起你有一点意思，我有一点意思，合在一起，就是一个完全的意思了。我说：自报公议的办法真好，不知是谁发明的，那位同学说：当然还是群众发明的，还是臭皮匠凑着发明的。
