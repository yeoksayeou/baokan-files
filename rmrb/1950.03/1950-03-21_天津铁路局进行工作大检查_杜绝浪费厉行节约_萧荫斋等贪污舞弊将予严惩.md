　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Conducts Major Work Inspection
    Eliminating Waste and Practicing Thrift
    Xiao Yinzai and Others to be Severely Punished for Embezzlement and Malfeasance
    [This newspaper's report] According to the Railway Worker's News: The Tianjin Railway Bureau's more than 40,000 employees are vigorously carrying out a thrift inspection campaign, and have achieved significant results. In early January, the Administration Bureau and Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Dezhou and other places successively organized thrift inspection committees to lead the development of the campaign. The Bureau's Administration, Political Department, Trade Union, and Youth League also formed inspection teams to go to various places to assist in the work.

    During the one-month inspection work, it was found that considerable achievements had been made in terms of thrift, and at the same time, some serious embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and waste phenomena were also uncovered. According to the Bureau's preliminary inspection and summary, in terms of thrift: with the assistance of the governments and farmers along the railway line, the Tianjin Railway Bureau collected railway materials scattered in various places. According to statistics and valuations in December of last year, the total value was approximately 8.6 billion yuan. After the Railway Bureau's automobile division switched to using charcoal, it only used 298 gallons of oil in January, while before switching to charcoal, it needed 1,060 gallons of gasoline each month. In terms of coal usage, due to the coal receiving station's strict coal receiving standards, correcting scales, and making every effort to reduce loss and theft during shipment, more than 10,000 tons of coal can be saved annually. In addition, for example, the Tangshan Transportation Section formulated oil usage standards, and 800 lamps can save 400 kilograms of kerosene per month. The Tianjin Public Security Section strictly reviewed the budget, resulting in a reduction in kerosene consumption from 260 kilograms to 70 kilograms in February. Electricity consumption is reduced by 155 kilowatt-hours per month. The Transportation Department recovered 25 occupied vehicles, which can increase revenue by 18 million yuan per day. As for the situation of corruption and waste, it is also quite serious. A small number of employees, due to the corrupt practices of the Kuomintang reactionary rule era, coupled with insufficient education from the leadership, lack of in-depth inspection, and lax discipline, have failed to quickly eradicate certain egregious acts of embezzlement and malfeasance, causing great losses to the people's railway. Among them, the collective embezzlement case led by Xiao Yinzai, the deputy director of the Tianjin Materials Factory's storage, was the most serious. They used their power to win over 13 backward elements to carry out organized and planned embezzlement. Starting from June and July of last year, they colluded with merchants, only seeking their own bribes and private enrichment, and intentionally carelessly accepting goods. For example, a batch of pressure beam screws made by Hongda and Yihengxiang Iron Factories was made by welding iron rings together, and was completely unusable inferior goods, but after the factory bribed 2 million yuan, they were all accepted. Fortunately, it was discovered early and not installed on the bridge, otherwise a serious accident would have occurred, causing serious losses to the people's property. As of the time of discovery in January, they had embezzled a total of more than 15.9 million yuan, and received meals and gifts more than ten times. Currently, the Bureau has sent the ringleaders Xiao Yinzai and four others to the Tianjin People's Court for severe punishment. The remaining members are still under investigation.

    At present, the thrift inspection campaign has gradually penetrated into every work department. Employees in many departments are consciously exposing wasteful phenomena, carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the fight against waste, and are planning various ways to save materials, water and electricity, office supplies, and other items. In order to further implement thrift and wage a serious struggle against wasteful and derelict elements, the Bureau's Political Department issued a notice on the 18th, deciding to implement the anti-waste and thrift campaign into daily work.

　　天津铁路局进行工作大检查
    杜绝浪费厉行节约
    萧荫斋等贪污舞弊将予严惩
    【本报讯】据铁路工人报消息：天津铁路局全线四万余职工，大力开展节约检查运动，已获显著成绩。一月上旬，管理局及北京、天津、唐山、张家口、德州等地均先后组织了节约检查委员会，领导运动的开展。路局行政、政治部、工会、青年团并组成检查小组，分赴各地协助工作。
    在一个月的检查工作中，发现在节约方面已获相当成绩，同时也检查出一些严重的贪污渎职和浪费现象。据路局初步检查总结，在节约方面：天津路局在铁路沿线政府及农民群众协助之下，收集遗散各地的铁路器材，据去年十二月份统计估价，总共约值八十六亿元。路局汽车部分改用木炭后，一月份仅用油二百九十八加仑，而未改用木炭前每月则需用汽油一千零六十加仑。在用煤方面，由于收煤所严格收煤标准、改正磅秤，发送时尽力减少丢漏与偷盗，全年可省煤万吨以上。此外，如唐山车务段制定用油标准，每月八百盏灯可省煤油四百公斤。天津公安段严格审核预算的结果，二月份领煤油量由二百六十公斤减为七十公斤。用电每月节省一百五十五度。运输处收回占用车二十五辆，每天可增加收入一千八百万元。至于贪污浪费的情况也是相当严重的。少数员工因存在国民党反动统治时代的腐败作风，加上领导上教育不够，检查不深入，纪律不严，致某些贪污舞弊恶劣现象未能迅速根除，使人民铁路受了很大损失。其中以天津材料厂以保管副主任萧荫斋为首的集体贪污事件最为严重。他们利用职权，拉拢落后分子十三人，进行有组织有计划的贪污搞鬼。他们由去年六、七月开始，勾结商人，只图自己受贿私肥，有意马虎收货。如宏达、义恒祥铁工厂承做的压梁螺丝一批，是用铁圈套上焊起来的，是完全不能用的劣货，但该厂贿赂二百万元后，即全部收下。幸发觉得早，未装到桥梁上，否则必将发生严重事故，使人民财产受到严重损失。截至一月发现时止，他们共贪污一千五百九十多万元，吃饭受礼十余次。现路局已将为首的萧荫斋等五人送天津市人民法院，将予严厉惩办。其余分子正在继续查办。
    目前节约检查运动已逐渐深入到每一个工作部门。许多部门的职工，自觉地揭发浪费现象，在反浪费中开展了批评与自我批评，多方筹划材料节约，水电节约、办公用品等节约办法。为进一步贯彻节约，并向浪费渎职分子进行严肃斗争，路局政治部又于十八日发出通知，决定把反浪费和节约运动贯彻到日常工作中去。
