    [Our Newspaper's Report] The fifteenth district of the Beijing suburbs is about to complete land reform, and most of the peasants who have received land have already received state-owned land use certificates. The emancipated peasants are in high spirits for production. Due to various disasters suffered by most villages last year, there is a phenomenon of spring famine, lack of food, lack of manure, and lack of seeds this year. In order to solve the difficulty of fertilizer shortage, the peasants are now picking up manure and hauling black soil from dawn to dusk. According to statistics, from last winter to now, the entire district has hauled 15,000 cartloads of ditch mud, averaging 1,500 jin per cartload, totaling 11,250 tons, which can be applied to 5,500 mu of land. In addition to their own use, peasants also use ditch mud to exchange for labor, with each cartload exchanged for two man-days.
    In order to shorten the spring famine, the government has vigorously mobilized the masses to sow early-maturing crops and helped solve the seed shortage problems of military families, farmers in disaster areas, and newly emancipated households. As of March 12th, a total of 65,000 jin of early-maturing crop seeds (millet) has been loaned out, which can be planted on 3,000 mu of land. This year, the entire district plans to plant 15,000 mu of early-maturing crops. Together with the 46,000 mu of wheat sown last autumn, it is estimated to produce 7.2 million jin of grain, which can feed 80,000 people in the entire district for two months.

    翻身农民情绪高  起早搭黑忙积肥
    【本报讯】京郊十五区即将全部结束土地改革，大部分得土地的农民，已领到国有土地使用证。翻身农民生产情绪极高。由于去年大部村庄遭受各种灾害，造成了今年的春荒、缺粮、缺粪、缺种籽的现象。为了解决肥料缺乏的困难，农民现正起早赶晚地拾粪，拉黑土。据统计，从去冬至目前全区共拉沟泥一万五千车，每车平均一千五百斤，共计一万一千二百五十吨，可上五千五百亩地。农民拉沟泥除供自用外，还用以换工，每车换两个人工。
    为了缩短春荒，政府曾大力动员群众播种早熟作物。并帮助解决军属、灾区农民及新翻身户的种籽缺乏问题。至三月十二日止，已共贷出早熟作物种籽粮小米六万五千斤，可种三千亩地。全区今年预计种植早熟作物一万五千亩，连去秋播种的小麦共计四万六千亩，可产粮七百二十万斤，全区八万人可吃两个月。
