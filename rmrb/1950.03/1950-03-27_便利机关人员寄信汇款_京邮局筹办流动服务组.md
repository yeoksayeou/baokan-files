　　To facilitate letter mailing and remittances for staff of government organizations, the Beijing Post Office is preparing a mobile service team. Previously, the Tianjin Post Office, to facilitate factory workers in mailing letters and remitting money to support their families, had drawn cadres to organize a mobile service team, which went to factories on payday to issue money orders and collect letters. The workers responded very well. The Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications believed that this mobile service team was beneficial to both facilitating the people and developing business, and issued a notice to all districts to imitate it. In this city, the Beijing Postal Administration is responsible for the preparations, with the staff of government organizations in the capital as the service target.

　　便利机关人员寄信汇款  京邮局筹办流动服务组
    【本报讯】京市邮局筹办流动服务组，便利机关工作人员寄信汇款。前此，天津邮局为便利工厂工人交寄信件、邮汇赡家款项，曾抽调干部，组织流动服务组，在工厂发薪日期前往开发汇票，收寄信件，工友们反映极好。邮电部邮政总局以此项流动服务组对于便利人民及发展业务均有裨益，特通令各区仿行。本市由北京邮政管理局负责筹办，以首都机关工作人员为服务对象。
