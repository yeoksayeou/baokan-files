Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today issued a notice to Party committees at all levels on unifying national financial and economic work. The full text is as follows:

Comrades of Party Committees at All Levels:

The State Council of the Central People's Government issued on March 3rd the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work." The CPC Central Committee believes that this decision of the State Council is completely correct and timely, and Party committees at all levels must use all methods to ensure the full implementation of this decision.

The CPC Central Committee believes that the past state of division among the liberated areas has completely changed, and the country has been unified in terms of territory, transportation, material exchange, currency system, and so on. Under these circumstances, if the main items of national fiscal revenue are not managed in a unified manner and used in a planned way, it will not only be detrimental to the country's financial and economic work but will also seriously affect the people's economic life and hinder the country's restoration and construction. Comrades in various regions have been accustomed to handling financial and economic work in a decentralized manner under the past long-term state of division, which was completely necessary and correct at the time, and great achievements were obtained. However, it is now necessary to earnestly change this. Failure to do so will result in serious errors. It is hoped that Party committees at all levels will fully explain the necessity of this change to every Party member so that they can have a correct understanding. At the same time, when changing from the old decentralized management method to unified management, it is inevitable that some difficulties will arise in various regions regarding the collection, allocation, and disbursement of finances and materials. Therefore, the CPC Central Committee requests Party committees at all levels to conduct explanations among Party members and non-Party personnel working in military, government, and financial departments, prepare to endure temporary partial difficulties, and ensure the rapid and complete realization of the State Council's decision, so as to work together to overcome the country's financial difficulties and avoid large fluctuations in finance and prices, in order to benefit the rapid recovery and development of the people's economy.

The CPC Central Committee believes that completing this year's planned tax revenue is an important link in overcoming financial difficulties and realizing the 1950 budget. Therefore, it directs Party committees at all levels to immediately select a cadre from the current minister-level position in each city and county Party committee to take charge of tax work in each city and county, overcome the erroneous view of neglecting tax work that exists in the minds of cadres, so as to ensure the full completion of this year's tax revenue plan. It is better for other departments to lack a minister than to allow the tax authorities to become a weak working organ.

The CPC Central Committee believes that Communist Party members must be models of compliance with national laws. If any Communist Party member in financial and economic work has illegal acts such as falsely reporting the number of people, engaging in corruption, or undermining the system, in addition to being severely punished by national law, they will also be severely sanctioned by Party discipline.

　　中共中央通知各级党委
    保证统一财经工作         
    加强税务干部完成税收计划
    【新华社北京三日电】中国共产党中央于今日向各级党委发出关于统一国家财政经济工作的通知全文如下：
    各级党委同志们：
    中央人民政府政务院已于三月三日发出了“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”。中共中央认为政务院这个决定是完全正确的和适时的，各级党委必须用一切方法去保障这个决定的全部实施。
    中共中央认为过去各解放区被分割的状态，已经完全改变，全国在地域、交通及物资交流与币制等等方面已经统一。在这种情况下，如果国家财政收入的主要项目不作统一的管理和有计划的使用，则非但不利于国家的财政和经济工作，且将严重地影响人民的经济生活与妨害国家的恢复和建设。各地同志对于财政经济工作，在过去长时期内，是习惯于被分割状态下的各自分散处理的，这在当时是完全必要和正确的，并且获得了巨大成绩。但是，现在必须切实地加以转变，如果不加转变，则要犯严重的错误。望各级党委，对于这种转变的必要性，向每个党员充分地加以解释，使他们都能有正确的认识。同时，从旧的分散的管理方法变为统一的管理时，各地在财政和物资上的征收、调度与支领等等方面，要发生若干困难，是难免的。因此中共中央要求各级党委在军政、财经各部门工作的党员和非党人员中进行解释，准备承受一时的部分的困难，保证政务院决定的迅速全部实现，以便共同努力来克服国家财政上的困难，避免金融物价的大波动，以利人民经济的迅速恢复和发展。
    中共中央认为完成今年的税收预定计划，是克服财政困难和实现一九五○年概算的重要环节，因此责成各级党委务必立即从全国每一市、县党委中各抽一个现任部长职务的干部，担任各该市、县的税务工作，克服干部思想上存在着的轻视税务工作的错误观点，以保证今年税收计划的全部完成。宁使其他各部缺少一个部长，而不要让税收机关成为一个弱的工作机关。
    中共中央认为共产党员必须是遵守国家法令的模范。如有共产党员在财政经济工作中，有虚报人数、贪污腐化、破坏制度等等违法行为，则除开受到国家法律的严重处罚外，同时还将受到党的纪律的严重制裁。
                    中国共产党中央委员会  一九五○年三月三日
