A Brief Overview of the Central and South China Region

The Central and South China Liberated Area was, in the period of the civil war, the renowned site of the Soviet Area – the revolutionary base. During the Anti-Japanese War, it also established several major guerrilla areas, including the Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Western Henan, and Eastern Guangdong areas. In 1947, the Liu-Deng and Chen-Su armies marched south, establishing the vast Central Plains Liberated Area between the Huai, the Yangtze, and the Han rivers, including the seven administrative regions of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Western Henan, Hubei-Henan, Western Anhui, Tongbai, Jianghan, and Southern Shaanxi. After the successive liberation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng around November 1948, the situation underwent a major change, forming a new, gradually unified Central Plains situation centered on Henan. In 1949, the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army marched south to cross the Yangtze River, completely eliminating the remaining bandit troops left on the mainland and achieving the complete liberation of the Central and South China mainland. Currently, all of the Central and South China region has been liberated, with the exception of Hainan Island.

The Central and South China region includes the six provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, as well as the two cities of Wuhan and Guangzhou. Its administrative divisions consist of 57 special administrative regions, 513 counties, 11 provincial-level cities, and 25 special district-level cities. The total area of the region is 1,145,940.95 square kilometers, accounting for 11.94 percent of the country's total land area of 9,597,520 square kilometers. The total cultivated land in the region is 327,643,328 mu, accounting for 19.06 percent of the country's total cultivated land area, with an average of 2.43 mu of cultivated land per person. The region's population is 142,966,884 people, accounting for 30.3 percent of the country's total population of 475,000,000. There are 70 cities with a population of over 30,000, with a population of 8,339,179 people, accounting for 5.85 percent of the region's total population. The old liberated areas, with two years of history, have less than 30 million people, accounting for less than 20 percent of the total population. The population of the new areas (the so-called new areas are regions that have not yet undergone systematic social reform) is over 110 million, accounting for 80 percent of the total population. Agriculture: The region's average annual output of crops is approximately 956,390,000 dan of unprocessed grain. The average yield per person is 714 jin, and the average annual yield per mu is 289 jin. The region's main special agricultural products: the cotton planting area is 10,008,000 mu, with an output of 2,685,000 dan; tobacco production is 3,536,278 dan. Special minerals: Tungsten ore reserves account for approximately 99.7 percent of the country's total, and antimony ore reserves account for 82 percent. Other metal deposits are also abundant, such as manganese ore, which accounts for approximately 70.5 percent of the country's total, and zinc, which accounts for approximately 48 percent. Hydropower resources are estimated to account for approximately 29 percent of the country's total. Special minerals and non-ferrous metals are indispensable raw materials for modern iron and steel, machinery, electrical, and other heavy industries, and the Central and South China region is the most important producing area. Industry: The proportion of modern machinery industries in the Central and South China region, both public and private, light and heavy industries combined, accounts for no more than 4.5 percent of the country's total; Henan and Jiangxi account for less than 1 percent. In terms of light industry, the flour industry is more developed, while textiles have only 249,628 spindles, accounting for 5.5 percent of the country's total number of spindles. With the exception of the Guangzhou Paper Mill, which is relatively large in scale, paper-making is still primarily handicraft production. Handicraft industry, however, is relatively developed, generally accounting for 15 to 20 percent of the national economy. Henan's silk weaving, Hunan's summer cloth, Jiangxi's paper-making, and Guangdong's bamboo and lacquer ware are all famous throughout the country. Commerce: Wuhan is the thoroughfare of nine provinces, and 5.6 percent of Shanghai's export goods are transshipped through Wuhan or handled by Wuhan. Guangzhou is one of the country's important import and export ports. Transportation: The Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways run north to Beijing and south to Kowloon via the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway; the Longhai Railway enters the region from Shaanxi, traversing Henan Province to Jiangsu Province in East China; the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway passes through Hangzhou and connects with the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in Zhuzhou; the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway runs from Jiujiang to Nanchang; and the Hunan-Guizhou Railway runs from Hengyang to Duyun in Guizhou. Water conservancy: The Yellow River is in the north, the Yangtze River is in the center, and the Pearl River is in the south. Water transport is convenient on the Yangtze River, reaching Chongqing upstream and Shanghai downstream. In addition, the Han River, Gan River, Xiang River, and others can also accommodate small steamships. The four provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Jiangxi have a total of 212 ships of various sizes, totaling 38,568.99 tons; 142 barges, totaling 27,384.92 tons; and 17 pontoons, totaling 2,285.11 tons. The total tonnage is 68,209.02 tons. Highways: According to statistics from the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, there were originally 18,875.6 kilometers of highways and 4,375 bridges. The damage caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops averaged over 60 percent. Through the efforts of our military and civilians, 11,047 li of highways and 1,586 bridges have been repaired. The three major trunk lines parallel to the Beijing-Hankou Railway pass through Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng, reaching Anlu near Hankou in the south, and can reach Suqian and Tianchang in Jiangsu to the east, and Luoyang to Shaanxi to the west, and are mostly open to traffic, reaching Pingyuan Province in the north, and can be described as connecting in all directions.

　　中南区简况
    中南解放区早在内战时期就是著名的苏区所在地——革命根据地。抗战期间又建立了鄂豫皖、豫皖苏、豫西、粤东等数大游击区。一九四七年刘邓、陈粟大军南下，创立了新的江淮河汉之间的广大的中原解放区，包括豫皖苏、豫西、鄂豫、皖西、桐柏、江汉、陕南七个行政区。一九四八年十一月间郑汴相继解放以后，形势发生重大变化，而形成以河南为中心的逐渐走向统一的中原新局面。一九四九年人民解放军第四野战大军南下渡江作战，全部消灭了留在大陆的残余匪军，获得中南大陆的全部解放。现在中南区除海南岛外已全部解放。
    中南区包括豫、鄂、湘、赣、粤、桂六省及武汉、广州两市，其行政区划共有五十七个专署，五一三个县，十一个省辖市，二十五个专区辖市。全区面积一、一四五、九四○·九五方公里，占全国土地面积九、五九七、五二○方公里的百分之一一·九四。全区耕地三二七、六四三、三二八亩，占全国耕地面积的百分之一九·○六，每人平均耕地二·四三市亩。全区人口一四二、九六六、八八四人，占全国人口四七五、○○○、○○○的百分之三○·三。三万人以上的城市七十座，人口八、三三九、一七九人，占全区人口百分之五·八五。有两年历史的老区不到三千万人，占总人口还不到百分之二十。新区人口（所谓新区是还没有有系统地进行社会改革的地区）在一亿一千万人以上，占总人口百分之八十。农业：全区农作物常年产量约计原粮九五六、三九○、○○○市担。平均每人收获量七一四斤，每亩平均常年产量二八九斤。全区主要特种农作物：棉花耕种面积一○、○○八、○○○亩，产量二、六八五、○○○担，烟叶产三、五三六、二七八担。特种矿产：钨矿储量约占全国百分之九九·七，锑矿储量占百分之八二。其他金属蕴藏亦丰，如锰矿约占全国百分之七○·五，锌约占百分之四八，水力资源据勘测估计约占全国总量百分之二九。特种矿产与有色金属是近代化钢铁，机械，电气等重工业不可缺少的原料，中南区是最主要的产地。工业：中南区近代化的机器工业，公私合计，轻重工业合计，占全国比重不过百分之四·五；河南、江西还不到百分之一。轻工业方面面粉业较多，纺织不过二四九、六二八枚锭子，占全国总锭数的百分之五·五。造纸除广州纸厂规模较大外，其他还是手工业生产。手工业则较发达，一般占全国经济百分之十五到二○。河南的丝织，湖南的夏布，江西的造纸，广东的竹木漆器都是全国闻名的。商业：武汉市是九省的通衢，上海出口物资有百分之五·六是经武汉转运或由武汉吞吐的。广州是全国重要出入商埠之一。交通：铁路有京汉与粤汉路，北达北京，南经广九路可至九龙；陇海路自陕西入境，横互本区之河南省而到华东区之江苏；浙赣路自杭州通过与粤汉路连接于株州；南浔路自九江至南昌；湘桂路自衡阳至贵州之都匀。水利：北有黄河，中有长江，南有珠江。水运以长江为便，上可达重庆，下达上海。此外还有汉水、赣江、湘江等均可通行小汽轮。鄂、湘、豫、赣四省共有大小轮船二百十二艘，计三八、五六八·九九吨。驳船一四二艘，计二七、三八四·九二吨。趸船一七艘，计二、二八五·一一吨。总计吨位是六八、二○九·○二吨。公路：据豫、鄂、湘、赣四省统计，原有公路一八、八七五·六公里，桥梁四、三七五座，被蒋白匪破坏平均在百分之六○以上，经我军民努力已修复公路一一、○四七里，桥梁一、五八六座。与京汉铁路平行的三大干线各经洛阳、郑州、开封南抵汉口附近的安陆，东面可通江苏的宿迁、天长，西可由洛阳到陕西，已经大部畅通，北达平原省，可谓四通八达。
