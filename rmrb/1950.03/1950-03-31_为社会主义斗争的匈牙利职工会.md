　　The activities of the Hungarian Trade Union, which has more than 1.6 million members, are now expanding to every sector of the national economy. When we look back on our past experiences, every citizen will surely remember the land reform, the nationalization of industry, the restoration of the railway arteries and the stability of the currency, the increase in coal production and the development of large-scale housing construction. In all these periods when we achieved results through struggle and labor, the trade union played the most important role.

　　Large numbers of bourgeois elements were ousted from important positions in the national economy and political life. Right-wing social democratic elements, who attempted to undermine the unity of the working class and damage our planned economy, have suffered a powerful blow. The united unity of the two workers' parties and the establishment of the unified Hungarian Workers' Party is a necessary result of the overall development of things. What we are facing now is the issue of increasing production.

　　The backwardness of Hungarian heavy industry and mining and metallurgy can be judged from the fact that in the first two decades of this century, Hungary had virtually no steel production or electricity consumption. To make matters worse, the war consumed 40.2 percent of the country's capital, reduced national income by nearly half, and caused serious damage to agriculture.

　　The people's enemies and their servants declared that it was impossible for Hungary to revive without the help of Anglo-American imperialism, and insisted that we must first borrow 30 million US dollars from the United States. But US aid, or even a single dollar loan, would be attached to political conditions. All are equally imperialist enslavement. The Hungarian people resolutely abandoned this path. They decided to restore industry and establish the country's entire economic enterprise in the short term with their own strength and the selfless friendship of the Soviet Union.

　　We completed the Three-Year Plan in two years and five months. As a result, our industrial production exceeded the 1938 figure by 40 percent. Agriculture is also recovering, and in 1949 it almost reached the pre-war level.

　　The working class and working people have generally shared the first fruits of their enthusiastic labor. At the completion of the Three-Year Plan, the people's living standards had increased by 37 percent. This increase can be demonstrated by the following examples: Before the war, the average meat consumption of Hungarian workers was 23.7 kg, while the figure now is 28.5 kg. In terms of sugar consumption, it has increased from 9.25 kg to 17.6 kg, and butter from 4.67 kg to 7.3 kg. Milk consumption and daily output are increasing similarly. The use of household electrical appliances has increased by 40 percent, and household gas consumption has increased by 60 percent.

　　Three-fifths of Hungary's industrial workers live in the great capital of Budapest. The improvement in food supplies there marks the general increase in the welfare of the working people. After the abolition of the rationing system in 1949, the daily bread consumption of Budapest residents increased from 30 karos (Hungarian weight unit) to 40 karos, and now 53-54 karos can be supplied daily, and most of it is wheat bread. The capital now supplies 20 tons of butter every day, while in 1947 it was only six tons. The average monthly sugar consumption per resident in Budapest is 1,800 cubic centimeters. It is worth thinking about in comparison, in the United States this figure is 880 cubic centimeters.

　　The rationing system has become a thing of the past. The prices of all goods have fallen: in just one year, the prices of fruits, poultry, eggs and other kinds of food in the market have fallen significantly by 50 percent.

　　But the increase in consumption is not the only achievement we have made in raising living standards. Improvements in transportation, the construction of houses, the development of social insurance, medical facilities serving about 3.5 million workers and their families, and the constant increase in child welfare equipment are all the results of the early completion of the Three-Year Plan. In Matra and Maesek, on Lake Balaton and other resorts, we already have many new hospitals, experimental hospitals, sanatoriums and well-equipped rest homes. These places are now entirely at the service of the workers.

　　When we were carrying out the Three-Year Plan, there were still some unemployed people in the country. But today, in the main industrial sectors, there is actually a shortage of labor. The Council of Ministers recently formulated a plan to organize the training of skilled workers by the state. Thousands of new workers are needed every month in the Three-Year Plan; and the current need is even greater. Tens of thousands of farmers have left the countryside to join the ranks of workers in our factories, which has become possible due to the mechanization of agriculture. Training and educating them is a major task, and the responsibility of the trade union in this regard is particularly important.

　　Today's Hungarian workers are more politically advanced and knowledgeable than they were at the beginning of the Three-Year Plan. In the factories, thousands of workers have been promoted to administrative positions; many of our country's ministers, secretaries and military leaders also come from the working class. Most of them were educated in the trade union movement and continue to play an important role in the activities of the trade unions.

　　The success of the planned economy, the development of industry and the increase in labor productivity depend on the promotion and development of the labor emulation movement. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the trade union is the main organizer of this movement. New terms expressing new ideas have appeared in Hungary: shock workers, creators of new production records, labor heroes, and outstanding workers in their respective enterprises. The large numbers of male and female workers who have won these titles have received silver or bronze labor medals. They are the heroes of the Three-Year Plan and the creators of the mass emulation movement in the first year of our Five-Year Plan.

　　Every day, newspapers and radios bring us reports of new achievements on the production front. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarian people participated in the emulation movement to congratulate Comrade Stalin on his 70th birthday. In the "Red Pro" factory alone, more than 10,000 male and female workers individually proposed guarantees to increase production, in the "Mavag" car factory, 2,000 workers made individual guarantees, and in the "Goldberger" textile factory, 2,300 people made guarantees. From the steel industry, mining and metallurgy, and the textile industry to the construction industry, the number of workers participating in the emulation movement is constantly increasing, labor productivity is increasing, and the percentage of production costs and defective products is decreasing. New working methods are being widely applied, and the experience of Soviet Stakhanovite workers has been regarded as the standard everywhere.

　　The help that our country has received from the Soviet Union is of inestimable value. I am not only referring to the new Soviet machines installed in our factories, nor only to the Soviet raw materials used in our industry, nor only to the fact that the Soviet Union has reduced Hungary's reparations (stipulated in the treaty - translator's note) by half. Here I want to talk about the great value of Soviet aid, that is, we have learned from the Soviet Union the socialist experience of building the national economy and a new life.

　　Soviet Stakhanovite workers visited several of our textile mills, factories and mines. They explained their working methods at the conference of new production record creators and shock workers in Hungary, and experimented with those methods in the field. Stalin Prize winner, turner Piekauf completed a job in two and a half minutes in the workshops of "Csepel" and "Lang" that took Hungarian workers eighty minutes to complete. These Stakhanovite workers taught our workers advanced Soviet working methods: Comrade Seryuzhin taught our bricklayers, Comrade Felemontov taught our miners, and Comrade Annaeva taught our textile workers. Since then, everyone has been improving their work with greater enthusiasm. In Budapest and other industrial centers, not only individual workers, but thousands of workers, have far exceeded the old standards.

　　Labor productivity is increasing, and with it comes increased income and a general improvement in workers' living conditions. For example, when Nándor Knecht, a turner in the motorcycle section of the "Red Csepel" factory, completed 980 percent of his work quota, his daily income increased to 276 forints (Hungarian currency).

　　Engineers and other technicians are playing an increasingly active role in ensuring the further development of industry. Last October, there were 2,534 rationalization proposals in our heavy industrial factories, of which 1,550 have now been implemented.

　　The Hungarian Trade Union Council recently announced that we have nearly 100,000 creators of new production records and rationalization proposers. This proves that the methods and experience of the Soviet Stakhanovite movement are fully beneficial to Hungary's socialist construction. The Stakhanovite movement has become an indispensable force in preparing for the completion of the Five-Year Plan. In order to improve and develop this movement, the Trade Union Council convened the first Hungarian National Conference of Stakhanovite Workers on February 26.

　　The purpose of convening this conference was to set up a national platform where our outstanding workers can exchange their experiences, increase the recognition of the advanced men and women in our production and today's heroes, and encourage workers throughout Hungary to boldly learn from their example. We want to focus the attention of the masses on criticizing and correcting shortcomings, tapping unused reserves, and overcoming obstacles in our path forward.

　　Every new task must inevitably struggle with many difficulties. This also applies to the development of the emulation movement. Its road is not smooth, and the old remnants must be cleared away before the road to victory can be reached. Last summer, the Hungarian Workers' Party called our attention to some serious mistakes and shortcomings that occurred in the activities of trade unions in factories. In this regard, some phenomena can be cited, we did not study production efficiency very carefully, and we did not give proper leadership to the emulation movement. Sometimes the achievements of a shock team often make us unable to see that the vast masses of workers have not yet embarked on the road of socialist labor. We underestimated the importance of individual guarantees and did not pay attention to the individual labor force of workers.

　　The Workers' Party told us that trade unions must pay more attention to production, and their duty is to educate workers to devote themselves to labor with patriotic spirit.

　　We have taken this as the basic principle of our factory activities, and as a result, we have achieved some good results. Last November's election of factory standing committees was very beneficial to improving the work of all trade unions. The composition of these committees has enabled the leadership of the trade unions to establish close ties with the masses of workers, and has promoted thousands of advanced workers to actively participate in trade union work. The result is that our trade unions are stronger.

　　This January, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party made a special decision on consolidating the achievements of the socialist labor emulation movement and further developing this movement. Among the 700,000 enterprise workers, more than 300,000 workers have made their own guarantees in the emulation movement. In addition, more than 100,000 workers have joined the movement as members of shock teams.

　　The strength of this vast production army of advanced workers has enabled us to complete almost 30 percent more tasks in the second half of 1949 than in the first half, and labor productivity has increased by 7.3 percent.

　　The work we are now facing is to consolidate our achievements and move forward more quickly, developing into large-scale collective forms of competition. This is extremely important for the completion of the Hungarian Five-Year Plan, which began on New Year's Day in 1950, which will lay the foundation for socialism.

　　The Five-Year Plan puts forward arduous tasks: to transform our motherland from an agricultural country into an industrial country. In order to complete this task, 50.9 billion forints have been allocated as production funds. Of this amount, 21.3 billion will be used to develop industry, 7.5 billion will be used to build transportation systems, and 8 billion will be used to restore agriculture. By 1954, our industrial output will increase by 186.4 percent compared with 1949. Our restored crop yields will almost increase by 50 percent. Solid socialist foundations will be laid simultaneously in cities and towns.

　　The completion of the tasks in the Five-Year Plan will increase labor productivity by 50 percent, while prices will be reduced by 25 percent. The plan will also increase the people's living standards by 185 percent compared with before the war.

　　We are facing a beautiful tomorrow, and the passionate struggle that the working people are waging today to realize their highest ideals and hopes in life is also moving. What an obvious contrast exists between Hungary and the West, where capitalist countries present the phenomenon of poverty, scarcity and unemployment among the vast population, wages are falling, or stagnating for a long time, while prices continue to rise.

　　People don't have to go far to find examples, our neighbor Austria is enough to illustrate this point. Its coal production has fallen by 20 percent compared with 1937, the textile industry has fallen by 50 percent, and the footwear industry has fallen by 45 percent. Even according to its official conservative materials, the number of unemployed in Austria has reached 133,000. Food in the market is only sold to people with ration cards. Speculation is rampant, and prices have risen fourfold since 1938, while the real wages of Austrian workers are only 49 percent of the pre-war level, which is low enough! Compared with before the war, the consumption of sugar and milk has been reduced by half, and the consumption of fruits, meat, eggs and fats has been reduced by one-third. Taxes are increasing. One-tenth of workers' income is used as a health insurance fund. The average weekly income of each worker in Austria is about 170 to 180 shillings, although even the official minimum cost of living index is 250 shillings, but in fact it takes at least 350 shillings per week to maintain life.

　　Immediately after Austria was ordered by the United States to devalue the shilling, prices soared. The "Marshall Plan" is a noose around the neck of Austrian workers. Under the name of "aid," the United States is giving the Austrian people junk they don't need, but not the necessities of life.

　　Austria today is importing white sugar and tobacco from the United States at high prices, although these things can be bought cheaply from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, and can be transported very quickly, but the people of Austria are not the masters of their own country: it is ruled by American monopoly capitalists.

　　Today, the policy of Austria's rulers is to drive the people into the abyss of disaster. And the right-wing socialists and trade union bosses in this country, like the traitors of the working class Baurak and Baum, are not defending the interests of the workers, but have become the servants of the imperialists.

　　What a difference there is in the fate of these two adjacent countries! This is the difference between the sunshine on a clear day and the darkness of night! A bright future belongs to the country that has already embarked on the road of socialism, and it is following the example of the Soviet Union, headed by the great Stalin. We are fighting for peace, we are building a new world of free people.

　　为社会主义斗争的匈牙利职工会
    匈牙利职工会理事会总书记  安妥·阿普罗
    拥有一百六十万以上会员的匈牙利职工会的活动，现正在扩展到国家经济的每一个部门里去。当我们回顾过去的经历时，每个人民对于土地改革、工业国有化、铁路动脉的恢复与币制的稳定，煤的增产和大规模住房建筑的发展，一定是记忆犹新的。在所有我们这些以斗争与劳动获取成果的时期里，工会起了最主要的作用。
    大批的资产阶级从国家经济与政治生活的重要位置中被撵了出去。右翼社会民主党分子，他们意图破坏工人阶级的团结并损害我们的计划经济，已遭受到有力的打击。两个工人政党的联合一致并建立起统一的匈牙利工人党，是事物全面发展的一个必然结果。此后我们所面临着的便是增加生产量的问题。
    过去匈牙利重工业与矿冶业的落后，可以从这个事实判断出来：在本世纪的第一个二十年中，匈牙利是谈不到什么钢铁生产和电力消耗的。使事情更糟的是，战争耗损了国家资金的百分之四十点二，国民收入减少了几近一半，并使农业也遭受了严重的损失。
    人民的公敌与他们的奴仆们宣称：匈牙利要想复兴，没有英美帝国主义的帮助是不可能的，并力言我们必须先向美国借贷三千万美元。但是美国的援助或甚至于一块钱的贷款，都会附带着政治条件。都同样是帝国主义者的奴役。匈牙利人民坚决地抛弃了这条道路。他们决定以他们自己的力量与苏联的大公无私的友谊的援助，在短期内恢复工业并建立起国家的整个经济事业。
    我们在二年五个月内完成了三年计划。结果使我们的工业生产量超过了一九三八年数字的百分之四十。农业也正在复兴，一九四九年中就几乎达到了战前的水平。
    工人阶级和劳动人民已普遍地分享到他们热忱劳动的第一次成果。在三年计划完成时，人民的生活水准已经提高了百分之三七。这种增加可以用下面几个例子来证明：在战前，匈牙利工人平二三·七公斤的肉类消费的数字则是二八·五。以食糖的消费情形来说，已从九·二五公斤增至十七·六公斤，牛油——从四·六七公斤到七·三公斤。牛奶的消费量和每日的产量是同样的增加着。家用电气用具的应用增加了百分之四十，家用煤气消费量则增加了百分之六十。
    匈牙利五分之三的产业工人住在伟大的首都布达佩斯。那里食物供应的改进标志着劳动人民福利的普遍增进。一九四九年取消配给制以后，布达佩斯居民每日的面包消费量从三十卡罗（匈牙利重量单位）增至四十卡罗，而现在每日已能供应五三——五四卡罗，并且大部分都是小麦面包。现在首都每天可供应二十吨的牛油，而在一九四七年却只有六吨。布达佩斯平均每月每个居民的食糖消费量是一千八百公分。用比较的方法来想一想是颇为值得的，在美国这个数字是八百八十公分。
    配给制度已经成为过去的事情了。所有货物的价格已经下降：仅仅在一年内，市场里的水果、家禽、蛋和其他种类的食品的价格就显著地跌落了百分之五十。
    但是消费量的增进并不是我们提高生活水准仅有的成就。交通运输的改进，房屋的兴建，社会保险制度的发展，为三百五十万左右工人和他们家属服务的医药设施，儿童福利设备的经常增加——所有这些都是提早完成三年计划的成果。在马特拉与马赛克，在勃拉敦湖与其他疗养区，我们已有许多新的医院、实验医院、疗养院与设备优良的休养所。这些场所现在是完全为工人服务了。
    当我们进行三年计划的时候，国内还有若干失业者。但今天在主要的工业部门里，实际上已感到劳动力的缺乏了。部长会议最近拟定了一项计划，预备由国家有组织的来主办训练熟练工人的事宜。三年计划中每月需要成千的新工人；而现在的需要就要更多了。成千成万的农民离开农村进入我们的工厂参加工人的队伍，已因农业的机械化而成为可能。训练并教育他们是一个重大的任务，而工会在这方面的责任就尤其显得重要。
    今日的匈牙利工人，与三年计划的初期比较起来，在政治上是更加提高而更有知识了。在工厂中，上千的工人已经擢升至行政的职位上去；我们国家内许多的部长、书记与军事领袖们也是出身于工人阶级。他们大都在工会运动中受到教育，并继续在工会的活动里担任着重要的任务。
    计划经济的成功，工业的发展和劳动生产力的提高，有赖于劳动竞赛运动的推行与发展，在工人党领导之下，工会是这个运动的主要的组织者。表现新的观念的新名词，已在匈牙利出现了：突击工人、生产新纪录的创造者、劳动英雄、各该企业里的优秀工人。荣膺这些称号的大批男女工人们，得到了银质或铜质的劳动奖章。他们是三年计划中的英雄，是我们五年计划第一年内群众性竞赛运动的创造者。
    每天从报纸上和无线电里，给我们带来了生产战线上的新成就的报告。几十万的匈牙利的人民，参加了竞赛运动以祝贺斯大林同志的七十寿辰。仅仅在“红色普”一个厂里，就有一万个以上的男女工人个别的提出了增加生产的保证，在“马凡奇”车厂里有二千个工人作单独的保证，在“哥尔堡”纺织工厂里有二千三百个人作了保证。从钢铁业、矿冶业、纺织业到建筑工业，参加竞赛运动的工人正不断的增加着，劳动生产力在提高着，而生产成本和废品的百分比却在下降。新的工作方法在广泛的应用着，苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工人的经验已被各地视为准绳。
    我们国家从苏联所获得的帮助，有着不可估计的价值。我所指的不仅是装置在我们工厂里的新的苏联机器，也不仅是在我们工业中应用着的苏联原料，也不仅是苏联减少了匈牙利赔款（和约所规定——译注）的一半。这里我要说的是苏联援助的巨大价值，即我们从苏联方面吸取了建设国民经济与新生活的社会主义经验。
    苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工人参观了我们若干的纺织厂、工厂和矿场。他们在匈牙利生产新纪录创造者和突击工人会议上讲解他们的工作方法，并且在现场的工作中实验了那些方法。斯大林奖金的获得者，旋工彼考夫在“色普”和“基昂”的工作房里，以两分半钟的时间完成了一件匈牙利工人需八十分钟才能完成的工作。这些斯塔哈诺夫工作者，把先进的苏维埃工作方法教给我们的工人：谢留金同志指教我们的砖灰匠，费列莫诺夫同志教我们的矿工，安娜也娃同志教我们的纺织工人。自此以后，大家就以更大的热情来改进工作。在布达佩斯和别的工业中心，不仅是个别的工人，而是成千的工人，都远远地超过了旧有的标准。
    劳动生产力已在提高中，与之俱来的是收入的增加与工人生活条件的普遍改善。举例来说，当南道·克奈奇脱，“红色普”工厂中机器脚踏车部分的旋工，在完成他工作定额的百分之九百八十时，他每天的收入就增到二百七十六个佛林（匈币）。
    工程师与其他技术人员在保证进一步发展工业上，起着越来越大的积极作用了。去年十月，在我们重工业工厂里，有二千五百三十四个合理化建议，其中有一千五百五十个现在已经付诸实施。
    匈牙利职工会理事会最近曾公布说：我们已有将近十万个生产新纪录的创造者与合理化建议者。这证明了苏联斯塔哈诺夫运动的方法与经验，对于匈牙利的社会主义建设，是充分有益的。斯塔哈诺夫运动成了准备完成五年计划的不可缺少的力量。为了提高并开展这个运动，职工会理事会召集了二月二十六日的匈牙利第一次全国斯塔哈诺夫式工人的会议。
    我们召开这个会议的目的，是想借此来布置一个全国性的大讲坛，在这里使我们优秀的工人们能够交流他们的经验，使我们生产中的先进男女们与今日的英雄们增加认识，并促使全匈牙利的工人们大胆地学习他们的榜样。我们要集中群众的注意来批评与改正缺点，发掘至今未用的后备力量，克服挡在我们前进道路上的障碍。
    每一件新的任务必定不可避免地要与许多困难作斗争。这也同样适用于竞赛运动的开展。它的道路是并不平坦的，必须扫清旧的残余才能到达胜利之路。去年夏天，匈牙利工人党号召我们注意职工会在工厂活动中所发生的某些严重的错误与缺点。这方面是可以举出一些现象的，我们没有极细心的去研究到生产效率，并且没有给竞赛运动以适当的领导。一个突击队的成就有时候往往使我们看不到广大工人群众至今还未走上社会主义劳动的道路。我们低估了个人保证的重要性，不去重视工人的个别劳动力。
    工人党告诉我们，职工会必须多多集中注意于生产，它们的职责就是要教育工人以爱国的精神献身劳动。
    我们以此作为我们工厂活动的基本原则，并因此而得到了一些很好的成就。去年十一月工厂常委会的选举对于改进所有工会的工作是非常有益的。这些委员会的组成，使职工会的领导与工人群众们取得了密切的联系，并提拔了成千的先进工人积极参加工会工作。这个结果是使我们的工会更强大了。
    今年一月，匈牙利工人党中央委员会对于巩固社会主义劳动竞赛运动的成果与更进一步地开展这个运动，作了特别的决定。在七十万企业工人中，有三十万以上的工人已在竞赛运动中各自作了保证。此外，有十万以上的工人在运动中参加为突击队的队员。
    这一支广大的先进工人们的生产军的力量，使得我们在一九四九年的下半年，比上半年多完成了几乎百分之三十的任务，而劳动生产力则增长了百分之七·三。
    现在我们面临着的工作是巩固我们的成就，并更迅速地前进，发展为大规模的集体形式的竞赛。这对于完成自一九五○年元旦开始的匈牙利五年计划是极为重要的，它将奠下社会主义的基础。
    五年计划提出了艰巨的任务：使我们的祖国从一个农业国转变为工业国。为了完成这个任务，五百○九亿的佛林已拨作为生产资金。在这个数目中，二百十三亿将用来发展工业，七十五亿用来建设运输系统，八十亿用来复兴农业。到一九五四年，我们工业的产量将较一九四九年增加百分之一八六点四。我们复兴后的农作物产量将几乎增加百分之五十。巩固的社会主义基石将同时在城市与乡镇中奠定起来。
    五年计划中各项任务的完成，将使劳动生产力提高百分之五十，而物价则会减低百分之二十五。计划同时将使人民的生活水准较战前提高百分之一百八十五。
    我们面对着美丽的明天，而劳动人民今天为把他们最高的理想与希望在生活中实现，而所作的热烈的斗争也是够动人的。匈牙利与西方之间是存在着多么明显的对比啊，西方资本主义国家呈现着广大人民的贫穷、匮乏与失业的现象，工资在下降着，或者长期停留在固定的水平上，而物价却在继续高涨。
    人们不必到很远的地方去找例子，我们的邻国奥地利就足以说明这一点了。它的煤产量已较一九三七年下降了百分之二十，纺织工业下降了百分之五十，而鞋靴业则下降了百分之四十五。即使根据其官方的保守的材料，奥地利的失业人数已达十三万三千。市场上的食物只售给有配给证的人。投机猖獗，物价自一九三八年以来已上涨了四倍，而奥地利工人的实际工资却只及战前水平的百分之四十九，这是够低了！如果与战前比较，食糖与牛奶的消费已减少了一半，水果、肉类、鸡蛋与脂肪则减少了三分之一。捐税却在增加着。工人所得的十分之一要作为健康保险基金。奥地利每个工人每周的平均收入大约在一百七十到一百八十个先令之间，虽然即使是官方的最低生活指数也得二百五十个先令，但实际上每周至少需要三百五十个先令才能维持生活。
    紧接着奥地利受命于美国而将先令贬值之后，物价立刻高涨。“马歇尔计划”是一个套在奥地利工人脖子上的绳圈。在“援助”的名义下，美国给奥地利人民的是他们所不需要的破烂货，而却不给生活必需品。
    奥地利今日在以高昂的价格，从美国运进白糖与烟草，虽然这些东西可以由匈牙利、捷克与保加利亚那里很便宜的买到，并可以很迅速的运送，但是奥地利的人民并不是他们自己国家的主人：统治它的是美国独占资本家。
    今日奥地利统治者的政策是驱人民于灾难的深渊。而这个国家里的右翼社会主义分子与工会头子们，像出卖工人阶级的鲍拉克与波姆那些国贼们，不是在卫护工人的利益，而成了帝国主义者的奴仆。
    这两个互相接壤的国家的命运，是有着何等的差别！这不管是晴天的阳光与夜晚黑暗的差别！灿烂的将来是属于已经走向社会主义道路的国家的，它正跟随着以伟大的斯大林为首的苏联的榜样前进。我们正在为和平而斗争，我们正在建设自由人民的新世界。
