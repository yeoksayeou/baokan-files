A Record of Visits with Three Soviet Professors Lecturing in China
    Jun Qiang, Bai Sheng

　　Yesterday, we visited the three Soviet professors who recently came to China to lecture: Dr. Nuzhdin, professor of biology; Dr. Giselev, professor of history; and Ms. Makarova, associate professor of economics.

　　Ms. Makarova, the Soviet associate professor of economics, greeted us first. She made people feel so approachable and kind. She spoke with great joy. She said that after graduating from the socio-economic group of the pedagogical department of Moscow State University at the age of twenty (1930), she worked as a teacher, and it has been twenty years now. She has been an associate professor at Moscow University for the past five years, specializing in political economics. While working, she studied in the research department, obtaining a master's degree and the position of associate professor in 1935. She has written papers on issues such as trade, prices, forms of economic links between urban and rural areas, and economic issues during the transition from socialism to communism.

　　She grew up in the city of Kuibyshev on the Volga River. Her father was a lathe operator. Her husband is a journalist. She has three children, the eldest of whom has already entered university. She excitedly told the reporter that only under the cultivation of the Soviet regime could a girl from a poor and ordinary working-class family like her have the opportunity to become a scholar. She also told the reporter that in the Soviet Union, family and children would never hinder a woman's career. She has been working continuously since graduating from university at the age of twenty. The Soviet regime has prepared all the conditions for women, enabling them to serve the motherland wholeheartedly without any worries. Professor Makarova engages in research and teaching while actively participating in social work. She is a propagandist and a worker for the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee. She has represented the Soviet Union at the Second Congress of the International Democratic Women's Federation in Budapest and participated in the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association delegation to Romania and Czechoslovakia.

　　Makarova said that she felt infinitely delighted to have the opportunity to come to the new China, which has won a heroic struggle.

　　Leaving Professor Makarova's room, we began to talk with Professor Giselev and Professor Nuzhdin.

　　Dr. H. N. Nuzhdin, professor of biology, was born in 1904 into a peasant family near the city of Yaroslavl in central Russia. He has a thin face, wears black-rimmed glasses, and his pipe is always in his hand. After graduating from secondary school in 1921, he joined the Communist Youth League and went to the countryside to work for the Youth League. In 1925, the Youth League sent him to a normal school to study biology. After graduating, he continued to engage in biological research at the institute. Later, he went to the graduate program of Moscow State University to specialize in genetics. He received his master's degree in 1935. When he finished his advanced studies in the doctoral research program of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, he was retained to work at the Institute of Genetics of the Academy of Sciences. From 1941, he served as the director of the Cytology and General Genetics Laboratory of this institute. He received his doctorate and professorship in 1946. He has written more than seventy academic works and is now the deputy director of the Institute of Genetics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the director of this institute is the world-renowned scientist Lysenko. In addition, Dr. Nuzhdin is also a professor at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

　　Dr. Nuzhdin talked about his experience, and he was proud of the broadest and most superior conditions that the socialist system provides for all scientific researchers. He also told reporters that the Soviet doctoral degree is different from that of any capitalist country. In capitalist countries, degrees are often obtained not based on academic achievements but solely on academic qualifications. This is not possible in the Soviet Union. In addition, Dr. Nuzhdin also mentioned that in 1948 he had given academic reports in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia.

　　Dr. Giselev is forty-five years old this year. He is a very strong and cheerful person, and at first sight, you can feel that he has strong perseverance. He was born near Moscow, and his father was a technician in a car manufacturing factory. In 1923, he entered the Department of History and Archeology of Moscow State University. In college, he actively participated in the struggle to apply Marxist-Leninist methodology to history and archeology. In 1930, he graduated from the Archaeological Science Research Institute with a master's degree.

　　After becoming a graduate student, Dr. Giselev organized expeditions to Altai and the middle reaches of the Yenisei River for more than twenty years of exploration. He wrote the book "Medieval History of Southern Siberia." Due to this book, he received a doctorate in history and a professorship in archeology. At the same time, this book also won the Lomonosov Prize. Comrade Giselev has been working in the Soviet Central Archaeological Agency—the Institute of Material Culture History named after Academician Marr of the Soviet Academy of Sciences—since 1930, and is now the deputy director of the institute and the head of the Primitive Archeology Department. In addition, he is also a professor of archeology at Moscow University and the editor-in-chief of the "Ancient History Bulletin" magazine.

　　In addition to "Medieval History of Southern Siberia," Dr. Giselev also has more than seventy other works on Siberia and Central Asia. From this, we know that he has a deep understanding of archeology and the history of the peoples of Siberia and Central Asia. Since 1927, he has led excavation work, obtained many valuable materials, and made many discoveries and contributions in ancient history. He has also visited Mongolia and given reports there.

　　The professors told us that they will stay in Beijing for ten days. Beginning this month, we will be able to hear: Dr. Nuzhdin's lectures: "The Struggle Between Materialism and Idealism in Biology," "What is Michurin Science and its Basic Principles"; Dr. Giselev's lectures: "Soviet Historical Science and History Teaching," "Soviet Archaeological Research"; Ms. Makarova's lectures: "Lenin and Stalin's Theory on the Transition from Capitalism to Socialism," "The Basic Characteristics and Superiority of the Socialist Economic System," etc. In addition to these scheduled special reports, they plan to hold seminars to answer questions raised by our audience. In addition, they will also visit academic institutions in the capital. Ten days later, they will go to Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places to continue lecturing. It is estimated that their total stay in our country will be about one and a half months.

　　来我国讲学的苏联三教授访问记
    君强　柏生
    昨天我们访问了最近来我国讲学的三位苏联教授——生物学教授努日金博士、历史学教授吉谢列夫博士、经济学副教授马卡洛娃硕士。
    苏联经济学副教授马卡洛娃硕士首先接待我们。她是这么使人感到亲切而和蔼。她满怀喜悦地畅谈着。她说，她从二十岁（一九三○年）在国立莫斯科大学师范学系社会经济组毕业后，即做教师工作，至今已二十年了。从五年前开始，她在莫斯科大学做副教授，专门讲授政治经济学。她一边工作一边在研究部学习，一九三五年得硕士学位和副教授职位。她写过关于贸易、价格、城乡经济联系的形式诸问题以及由社会主义过渡到共产主义时期经济问题的论文。
    她生长在伏尔加河畔的古比雪夫城。父亲是个旋工。她的丈夫是一个新闻记者。她有三个孩子，大女儿已入了大学。她兴奋地告诉记者说：像她这样一个穷苦而平凡的工人家庭出身的女孩子，只有在苏维埃政权的培养下，才能有机会成为一个学者。她还告诉记者：在苏联，家庭和孩子决不会妨碍妇女的事业。她从廿岁大学毕业到现在，一直都在工作着。苏维埃政权为妇女准备了一切条件，使她们能毫无顾虑地为祖国尽心服务。马卡洛娃教授一方面做研究及教学工作，同时还积极地参加了社会工作。她是一位宣传员，是苏联妇女反法西斯委员会的工作者。她曾代表苏联出席布达佩斯国际民主妇联第二次大会及参加苏联对外文化协会代表团到过罗马尼亚及捷克斯洛伐克。
    马卡洛娃说，她这次有机会来到英勇斗争获得胜利的新中国，感到无限的欢欣。
    从马卡洛娃教授房间走出，我们开始和吉谢列夫教授、努日金教授谈起来。
    生物学教授Ｈ·Ｎ·努日金博士，一九○四年出生在苏联中部雅罗斯拉夫城附近的一个农民家庭中。清癯的面庞，带着黑色宽边的眼镜，烟斗时刻不离手。他一九二一年在中学毕业后加入了共产主义青年团，到乡村去做青年团工作。一九二五年青年团派他到师范专门学校攻读生物学，毕业后他继续留在该院从事生物学的研究工作，后来又到国立莫斯科大学研究生班专门研究遗传学。一九三五年得硕士学位。当他在苏联科学院博士研究班深造结束时，他又被留在科学院遗传学研究所工作。一九四一年起，他担任了这个研究所的细胞学和一般遗传学化验室主任。一九四六年得博士学位和教授职位。他的学术著作有七十种以上，现在是苏联科学院遗传研究所副所长，而这个研究所的所长就是世界著名的科学家李森科。此外，努日金博士也还是一个农业科学院的教授。
    努日金博士谈着他的经历，他骄傲于社会主义制度给一切科学研究工作者以最广阔最优越的条件，他并且告诉记者说，苏联的博士学位和任何资本主义国家是不同的。资本主义国家的学位，常常不是根据学术成就而是单凭学历就可以获得。在苏联却不能够这样。此外，努日金博士还谈到在一九四八年他曾到过德国、奥地利、捷克做过学术报告。
    吉谢列夫博士，今年四十五岁。他是一位身体很健壮爱说爱笑的人，一见面就使你感到他具有强韧的毅力。他生在莫斯科附近，父亲是车箱制造厂的技工。一九二三年入国立莫斯科大学历史考古学系。在大学中，他积极地参加了把马列主义方法论应用到历史考古学方面来的斗争。一九三○年在考古学科学研究院卒业，得硕士学位。
    吉谢列夫博士做了研究生后，曾组织考察队到阿尔泰和叶尼塞河中游去做了二十多年的探测工作。写成了《南西伯利亚的中古史》一书。由于这本书获得了历史学博士学位和考古学教授职位，同时这本书还获得了罗曼诺索夫奖金。吉谢列夫同志从一九三○年起即一直在苏联中央考古机关——苏联科学院玛尔院士物质文化史研究所工作，现任该所副所长并主持原始考古部。此外，他还是莫斯科大学考古学教授和《古史通报》杂志的主编。
    除了《南西伯利亚的中古史》外，吉谢列夫博士，也有着另外的七十种以上的、关于西伯利亚及中亚细亚的著作。由此我们知道他对于考古学和西伯利亚及中亚细亚民族的历史，是有深刻研究的。他从一九二七年至今，领导发掘工作，得到许多宝贵材料，在古代史上面有着不少的发现和供献。他还到蒙古考察过，在那里也做过报告。
    教授们告诉我们，他们将在北京停留十天。本月十月开始，我们将可以听到：努日金博士的：《生物学中唯物论与唯心论之斗争》，《什么是米丘林科学及其基本原理》；吉谢列夫博士的：《苏联的历史科学与历史教学》，《苏联的考古研究》；马卡洛娃硕士的：《列宁斯大林关于从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的理论》，《社会主义经济制度的基本特点及优越性》等。除这些预定的专题报告以外，他们准备根据我国听众提出的问题分别举行座谈会来进行解答。此外，他们还将参观与访问首都各学术机关。十天后，他们将到天津、上海、南京、武汉、广州等地继续讲学。预计在我国的全部停留时间，约在一个半月左右。
