　　Central Academy of Fine Arts Actively Prepares for Air Defense
　　[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday (the 6th), faculty, staff, and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts held a meeting and established a school-wide air defense committee. Male and female students immediately mobilized to participate in digging air-raid shelters and pasting paper on windows, etc. Everyone agreed that: preparedness prevents misfortune. To oppose the bombing by the remnant bandits under the command of the American imperialists, the first thing is to not panic or be careless, and to earnestly carry out air defense preparations.

　　中央美术学院积极准备防空
    【本报讯】中央美术学院教职员工及同学们昨天（六日）开会，成立了全校的防空委员会。男女同学们立即动员起来参加了挖防空壕，糊玻璃窗等工作，大家一致认为：有备才能无患。反对美帝指挥下的残匪的轰炸，首先要不慌张、不麻痹，认真进行防空准备。
