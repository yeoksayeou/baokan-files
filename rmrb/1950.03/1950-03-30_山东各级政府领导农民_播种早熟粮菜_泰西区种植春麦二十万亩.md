Shandong Governments at All Levels Lead Farmers
　　Sow Early-Maturing Grains and Vegetables
　　Taixi Area Plants 200,000 Mu of Spring Wheat

[Our Newspaper News] According to the Dazhong Daily news: People's Governments at all levels in Shandong Province are implementing the State Council's instructions, leading farmers to plant large quantities of early-maturing grains and vegetables to overcome the spring famine. In the Lunan area of ​​the province, a considerable amount of land could not be sown with autumn wheat last year due to flooding. After drainage last winter, 700,000 mu of land in the three special districts of Nishan, Taixi, and Taizao has been able to grow spring wheat and other early-maturing crops. This spring, the administrative office of the area allocated 2.85 million jin of spring planting loan grain and 48,000 jin of vegetable seeds to support farmers in disaster areas in solving seed difficulties, and mobilized farmers in various places to help each other. Cooperatives at all levels also supplied some fertilizers and seeds. According to statistics from Taixi Special District in the first ten days of this month, more than 214,000 mu of spring wheat has been planted in the area. The 29,500 jin of early-maturing vegetable seeds in the special area have also been distributed to households, with a plan for each person to plant 0.2 mu of vegetables and ten pumpkin plants. In addition to mobilizing farmers to solve the difficulties of early-maturing grain and vegetable seeds themselves and planting a large amount, the People's Government of the Bohai District of the province has lent all one million jin of spring wheat, peas, rapeseed, spring cabbage and other seeds purchased by cooperatives in various places last winter to households. Most areas of the district have now been sown. It is estimated that this grain and vegetable seed loan can supply farmers in disaster areas to plant 250,000 mu of land, which can be harvested around March and April of the lunar calendar. During the Spring Festival, farmers in Gaoqing County rushed to cultivate the land after the water receded and have planted more than 10,000 mu of spring wheat. The Jiaodong District Committee of the Communist Party of China in the province convened a district-wide party representative meeting in January, and counties also convened party representative meetings and people's representative meetings to specifically discuss this spring's production and disaster relief work, focusing on mobilizing and assisting farmers in disaster areas to plant early-maturing grains and vegetables. In some areas of the district, the planting of early-maturing grains and vegetables has formed a movement. Cooperatives in the Donghai Special District of the area supplied farmers with more than 100,000 jin of spring wheat, groundnuts and other seeds, which, together with mutual lending among farmers, solved the problem of seed shortage. Under the slogan of "plant first, harvest first," farmers in Muping County have planted more than 4,000 mu of barley. Statistics from 9,100 farmers in Zhaoyuan County show that they have planted 9,600 mu of barley. Statistics from 10,700 households show that they have planted 2,180 mu of early-maturing vegetables. Currently, most of the early-maturing grains and vegetables planted in various parts of the district have sprouted.

    【本报讯】据大众日报消息：山东省各级人民政府贯彻政务院指示，领导农民大量种植早熟粮菜，克服春荒。该省鲁中南区去年不少土地因被水淹，未能播种秋麦。经去冬排水后，尼山、泰西、台枣三个专区有七十万亩土地，已能种植春麦和其他早熟作物。今春该区行署拨出二百八十五万斤春种贷款粮、四万八千斤菜种，扶持灾区农民解决种籽困难，并动员各地农民互助互济，各级合作社亦供给部分肥料、种籽。据泰西专区本月上旬统计，该地已种上春麦二十一万四千余亩。该专区早熟菜种二万九千五百斤菜种也已分发到户，计划每人种二分地的菜，十棵南瓜。该省渤海区人民政府除动员农民自己解决早熟粮菜种籽困难，大量种植外，已将去冬各地合作社采购的百万斤春麦、豌豆、油菜、春白菜等种籽，全部贷放到户，现该区大部地区已经播种。该项粮菜贷种，估计可供灾区农民种地二十五万亩，至旧历三、四月间即可接口。高青县农民春节中，抢耕退水地，已种上春麦万余亩。该省中共胶东区党委于一月召开全区党员代表大会，各县亦先后召开了党员代表会和各界人民代表会，具体讨论今春生产救灾工作，以动员扶助灾区农民种早熟粮菜为主，现该区部分地区种植早熟粮菜已形成运动。该区东海专区合作社供给农民春麦、地豆子等种籽十万余斤，加上农民间的互相借贷，解决了种籽的困难问题。牟平县农民在“先种先接口”的口号下，已种上大麦四千余亩。招远县九千一百个农户统计，已种上大麦九千六百亩。一万零七百户统计种上早熟菜二千一百八十亩。现该区各地种上之早熟粮菜已大部出芽。
