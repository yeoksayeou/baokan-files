　　New Opera in the Soviet Union Today
　　The Soviet opera houses and musical comedy theaters will add twelve new operas, three ballets, and five operettas by Soviet composers to this year's repertoire.
　　Of particular interest is the opera "With All My Heart" by Ukrainian composer Yevgeny Zhukovsky, which is adapted from the novel of the same name by Elizar Maltsev, who won the Stalin Prize last year. The opera will be performed in Russian at the Bolshoi Theatre and the Leningrad Small Opera Theatre. In Kiev and other Ukrainian cities, the opera will be performed in Ukrainian.
　　Currently, several opera houses are rehearsing other new operas: Kabalevsky's "The Taras Family" and Enke's "The Rich Bride." The first opera is based on Boris Gorbatov's popular novel "The Unbowed"; the second opera depicts the happy and prosperous life of collective farmers. Local theaters are also staging some operas. For example, the Estonian Theater will stage Kap's opera "The Singer of Freedom" about an Estonian poet, Johan Tao, who died in a secret police dungeon. The Stalinabad Opera Theatre is rehearsing Balasanyan's opera "The Road to Happiness." The opera depicts how the Soviet people conquered the treacherous nature of the Pamir Plateau.
　　It has been two years since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued the famous resolution on Muradeli's opera "The Great Friendship." These two years have been years of vigorous and creative effort for Soviet composers. The achievement is that in 1949, 49 musical theaters across the country performed 23 new works composed by Soviet composers, including 19 operas and ballets, and many have won high praise from the Soviet music community, such as Gliere's ballet "The Bronze Horseman," Zhuraits's ballet "Youth," Leozov's opera "Medig Masha," and Miliutin's operetta "Trembita." This year, Soviet composers are successfully continuing to create operas and ballets with realistic themes.

　　今日苏联的新歌剧
    苏联歌剧院和音乐喜剧剧院在本年的演剧节目单上，将要加上苏联作曲家所制就的十二个新歌剧、三个舞剧和五个小歌剧。
    最有兴味的是乌克兰作曲家叶夫金尼·儒科夫斯基的歌剧《全心全意》，这个歌剧是根据艾里查尔·马尔节夫去年荣获斯大林奖金的小说（也叫那个名字）改编的。该剧将以俄语在大剧院和列宁格勒小歌剧院上演。在基辅及乌克兰其他城市中，该剧将以乌克兰语演出。
    现在，若干歌剧院正在排演其他新歌剧：卡巴列夫斯基的《塔拉斯之家》和恩凯斯的《阔新娘》。第一个歌剧是根据鲍利斯·郭尔巴托夫大受欢迎的小说《不屈的人们》改编而成；第二个歌剧描写集体农民的幸福与富裕的生活。各个地方的剧院也正在演出一些歌剧。例如，爱沙尼亚剧院将演出卡普所作的关于一个死在秘密警察暗牢中的爱沙尼亚诗人约汉陶的歌剧《自由的歌手》。斯大林阿巴德歌剧院正在排演巴拉散扬的歌剧《幸福之路》。该剧系描写苏联人民如何征服帕米尔高原凶恶的大自然的情形。
    自从苏联共产党中央委员会发表关于穆拉德里斯的歌剧《伟大的友谊》的著名决议以来，迄今已经两年了。这两年对苏联作曲家来说，是奋发的、有创造性努力的年头。成绩是：在一九四九年全国有四十九家音乐剧院演出了苏联作曲家谱制的二十三部新作品，其中包括十九个歌剧和舞剧，并且有许多已经赢得了苏联音乐界的崇高的评价，像哥里尔的舞剧《青铜骑士》、朱拉吉斯的舞剧《青年》、利奥佐夫的歌剧《麦狄格马沙》、米里乌丁的小歌剧《特莱姆比塔》等即可为例。今年，苏联的作曲家正在成功地继续创造以现实生活为主题的歌剧和舞剧。
