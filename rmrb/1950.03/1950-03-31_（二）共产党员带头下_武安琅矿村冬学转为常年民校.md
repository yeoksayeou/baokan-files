　　(II) Communist Party Members Take the Lead
    Wu'an Langkuang Village Winter School Transforms into a Regular People's School

    [News from this newspaper] The winter school in Langkuang Village, Ninth District, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, has been transformed into a regular people's school. Under the leadership of Communist Party members, more than fifty young farmers (including twenty-six women) voluntarily signed up to participate in regular learning. The village's winter school, under the principle of close integration with production, achieved very good results: Through the research of the winter school, the village's transportation team was reformed, changing from one person taking care of one animal to one person taking care of three or four animals. In half a winter, they earned 13,000 catties of millet and saved a lot of manpower and time for learning and other production activities. The students learned up to more than 300 characters; and they took a step forward politically, learning the new democratic rural economic policy. The village's winter school has been praised by leading organs. The masses' enthusiasm for learning is high, creating conditions for transitioning to a people's school.

    The village's people's school has already established a learning pact. It stipulates that collective classes will be held for two hours every three, six, and nine days of the month (women in the afternoon, men in the evening). Usually, learning groups are formed according to the students' production and living conditions. The group leader distributes lessons and characters, and mutual assistance learning is carried out using the "people teach people" method. Teachers take turns teaching, with every four classes counting as one work-day, and the people's school provides remuneration according to the work-day.

　　（二）共产党员带头下
    武安琅矿村冬学转为常年民校
    【本报讯】河北省武安县第九区琅矿村的冬学已转为常年民校，在共产党员的带动下，五十余名青年农民（其中妇女二十六名）自愿报名参加常年学习。该村冬学在密切结合生产的方针下，获得了很好的成绩：通过冬学的研究，改造了村里的运输队，由以前一个人看管一个牲口改为一个人看管三、四个牲口，半个冬天赚了一万三千斤小米，并节省了大量人力与时间进行学习和其他生产；学员们最多的学习了三百多个字；而且在政治上提高了一步，学习了新民主主义的农村经济政策。该村冬学曾受领导机关的表扬。群众的学习情绪高涨，为转入民校创设了条件。
    该村民校已订出学习公约。规定每逢三、六、九日集体上课两小时（妇女在中午，男子在晚上）。平时根据学员生产与居住情况分编学习小组，由小组长领课领字，运用“民教民”的方法互助学习。教员上课采取换工方式，每上课四次算一个工，由民校按工给予报酬。
