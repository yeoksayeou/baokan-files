Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch: The Fourth All-Army Health Work Conference of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, lasting eighteen days, concluded on February 6th. Over sixty representatives from various military regions, army corps, armies, special columns, the navy, air force, East China Military and Political University, and directly subordinate organs and schools attended the conference, along with over fifty representatives from other organs as observers. The conference heard instructions from Deputy Commander Su Yu, Logistics Department Commander Kuang Rennong, and Peng Fangfu, Chief of the Medical Administration Department of the Central Military Commission's Health Department (who attended the conference). Li Zhenxiang, Deputy Minister of the Logistics Health Department, conveyed the basic spirit and various resolutions of the Central Military Commission's National Health Administration Conference, and Wang Zhongliang, Political Commissar, reported on the general guidelines and tasks for health work in 1950 proposed by the CCP Committee of the Health Department, as well as typical reports on various health work experiences.

Based on the guidelines and tasks for health work in 1950 proposed by the CCP Committee of the Health Department, the conference conducted multiple studies and discussions and determined the following specific tasks: 1. In order to fully accomplish the task of providing health work and war wound treatment for troops clearing out remnants of the enemy along the southeast coast and liberating Taiwan, immediately conduct full ideological mobilization among all medical and health personnel and directly subordinate field hospitals throughout the army. Strengthen the concept of war and the spirit of overcoming difficulties to complete tasks, rapidly restore the health of existing wounded and sick soldiers, and cooperate with military and political organs and supply departments to carry out the "strong soldiers and sturdy horses" campaign throughout the army. Organize strong front-line health departments and a large number of field hospitals, and mobilize and organize hospitals in various military regions and major cities as reserve forces. Study and learn about maritime amphibious warfare treatment work and the prevention and treatment of local endemic diseases in coastal and Taiwan areas. Fully prepare organizationally, ideologically, technically, and materially to ensure the thorough completion of the task. 2. In order to implement the working principle of "prevention first, treatment as secondary," it is necessary to deeply educate all medical and health personnel throughout the army to value sanitation and epidemic prevention work, overcome the current tendency among medical cadres to simply focus on treatment and neglect epidemic prevention and healthcare, establish epidemic prevention and healthcare organizations at all levels, improve the knowledge of preventive medicine among medical cadres, and conduct widespread publicity and education to mobilize all commanders and fighters throughout the army to value and participate in sanitation and epidemic prevention work. Launch army-wide sanitation campaigns, strengthen the army's sanitary equipment, and emphasize preventive vaccinations against various epidemic diseases to ensure the physical health of the troops. 3. In order to gradually strengthen the construction of health work, it is necessary to improve and establish health institutions at all levels, establish formal working systems, improve the quality of existing cadres based on different situations, absorb specialized technical personnel and train young intellectuals to participate in work, strengthen the unity and transformation of former personnel in various taken-over units, cherish public property, practice strict economy, enforce strict systems, oppose waste, and carry out labor production under possible conditions.

In order to implement and realize the above guidelines and tasks, the conference unanimously agreed that it is necessary to: 1. Strengthen the leadership of Party committees and branches at all levels, proactively grasp ideological leadership, and overcome the current phenomena of certain anarchism and lack of discipline. 2. Learn new leadership methods, overcome the leadership style of focusing on administrative affairs, and be good at using organizational forces to give play to the initiative and creativity of the masses. 3. Strengthen political work and strengthen the basic political and ideological education of all personnel. Political work must study the characteristics of technical departments and grasp the laws of technical departments. The conference also adopted resolutions on carrying out epidemic prevention and healthcare work in the troops and five proposals on healthcare and epidemic prevention, cadre education, system establishment, medicine and funding, and veterinary work.

Finally, Cui Yitian, Minister of the Health Department, and Li Zhenxiang, Deputy Minister, made concluding remarks. In addition to pointing out the tasks and guidelines for 1950, they emphasized that while health work had achieved certain successes and experiences in war wound treatment in the past, this time it is a cross-sea landing operation, and we cannot be satisfied with past experiences and achievements. We must conscientiously study and do a good job in various preparatory works to strive to thoroughly complete the glorious tasks of health work in 1950.

　　研究两栖作战救治工作  协助完成解放台湾任务
    华东军区暨三野召开卫生工作会议
    【新华社南京电】历时十八天的华东军区暨第三野战军全军第四届卫生工作会议，已于二月六日结束。出席会议的有各军区、各兵团、各军、特种纵队、海军、空军、华东军政大学及直属机关和学校的代表六十余人，其他机关列席代表五十余人。会议听取了粟裕副司令员、后勤部邝任农司令员及出席此次会议的中央军委卫生部医政处彭方复处长等对会议的指示，以及后勤卫生部李振湘副部长关于中央军委全国卫生行政会议基本精神及各项决议的传达和政委王仲良关于卫生部中共党委提出的一九五零年卫生工作的总方针与任务的报告，以及各种卫生工作经验的典型报告。
    大会根据卫生部中共党委所提的一九五零年卫生工作的方针与任务，进行了多次的研究与讨论，确定了下列具体任务：一、为全力完成肃清东南沿海残敌解放台湾的部队卫生工作与战伤救治任务，立刻在全军所有医务卫生人员与直属各野战医院中进行充分的思想动员，加强战争观念与克服困难完成任务的精神，使现有的伤病员迅速恢复健康，并配合军政机关和供给部门开展全军“兵强马壮”运动；组织强有力的前方卫生部和大量野战医院，并动员与组织各军区及各大城市的医院作为后备力量，研究与学习海上两栖作战救治工作及沿海与台湾地区地方流行性病的预防和治疗，充分做好组织上、思想上、技术上、物质上的准备工作，保证彻底完成任务。二、为贯彻“预防为主、医疗为辅”的工作方针，必须深入教育全军所有医务卫生人员重视卫生防疫工作，克服目前医务干部中所存在的单纯重视治疗、忽视防疫保健的倾向，建立各级防疫保健组织，提高医务干部预防医学的知识，并广泛进行宣传教育，动员全军指战员重视与参加卫生防疫工作，开展全军性的卫生运动，加强部队卫生装备和重视各种疫病的预防注射，保证部队体力健康。三、为逐步加强卫生工作的建设，必须健全与建立各级卫生机构，订立正规工作制度，根据不同情况提高现有干部质量，吸收专门技术人员与训练青年知识分子参加工作，加强对各被接管单位旧人员的团结与改造工作，爱护公物，厉行节约，严格制度，反对浪费，及在可能条件下进行劳动生产。
    为贯彻实现上述方针与任务，会议一致认为必须：一、加强各级党委与支部的领导，主动掌握思想领导，克服目前存在的某些无政府无纪律现象。二、学会新的领导方法，克服事务主义领导作风，善于运用组织力量，发挥群众的积极性和创造性。三、强化政治工作和加强全体人员的基本政治教育与思想教育，政治工作必须研究技术部门的特点，掌握技术部门的规律。会议并通过了开展部队防疫保健工作的决议以及关于保健防疫、干部教育、制度编制、药材经费、兽医工作等五项提案。
    最后由卫生部部长崔义田、副部长李振湘作了总结，除指出一九五零年的任务与方针外，更着重指出：卫生工作过去在战伤救治上虽然有一定的成绩和经验，但是这次是渡海登陆作战，不能满足于过去的经验与成绩，必须认真学习，做好各种准备工作，为彻底完成一九五零年卫生工作的光荣任务而努力。
