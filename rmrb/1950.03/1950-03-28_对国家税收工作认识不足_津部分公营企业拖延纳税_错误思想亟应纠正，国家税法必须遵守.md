　　Insufficient Understanding of National Tax Work
    Some Public Enterprises in Tianjin Delay Tax Payments
    Erroneous Thinking Must Be Corrected, National Tax Laws Must Be Obeyed
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Tianjin] (By our special correspondent Gu Weijin) It is reported: Some state-owned and public enterprises in Tianjin have, in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax" and the "Provisional Measures for Public Enterprises to Pay Industrial and Commercial Tax" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government, declared and paid taxes on schedule. However, some are still delaying the payment of industrial and commercial taxes for 1949, which has prevented Tianjin's tax revenue plan from being completed on schedule, affecting the state's fiscal revenue. The Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau originally scheduled the declaration of tax payments by state-owned and public enterprises to begin on February 4th, with the deadline for declaration set for the 10th, and all tax revenue was to be deposited into the treasury by March 5th. However, the actual result was that only three units declared within the seven days from February 4th to 10th. The Tax Bureau then extended the declaration deadline to February 16th, but only six units made declarations. From February 21st, the Tax Bureau began sending cadres to various enterprises to urge declarations, but the response was still not enthusiastic. According to statistics on March 17th, out of 183 public enterprises in the city (including some purchasing units stationed in Tianjin from other areas), only 81 units had declared, and only 64 units had complete declaration materials that could be assessed for tax. 102 units had not declared. According to statistics on March 20th, out of 82 state-owned enterprises in the city, only 42 units had declared, and only 13 units had complete declaration materials that could be assessed for tax. 40 units had not declared.
    The delays in tax payments by some state-owned and public enterprises in Tianjin are manifested in the following ways: (1) Adopting an attitude of ignoring or prevaricating about declarations. For example, the China Textile Company repeatedly delayed declarations. Director Li of the Tax Bureau led cadres to the company to urge declaration, but the company's manager and military representative refused to meet them in person. The Tax Bureau cadres then stationed themselves in the company's accounting office to urge declaration. The head of the company's accounting department submitted the profit and loss statement and balance sheet. The company's general manager was very dissatisfied with this, refused to stamp the declaration form, and criticized the head of the accounting department. (2) Avoiding declaration. For example, out of 357 purchasing agencies stationed in Tianjin from other areas, 242 left Tianjin during the declaration period (some of whom left for other reasons, which should be excluded). Of the 115 units remaining in Tianjin, 38 had moved their addresses and were difficult to find temporarily. (3) Declarations in name only. - For example, among the 42 state-owned enterprises that had declared, 29 units submitted incomplete materials that could not be assessed for tax. (4) Proposing "non-profit as the purpose" and requesting tax exemption. Such as the streetcar, automobile, and water companies, three enterprises of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, and the "May 1st" Production Cooperative belonging to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, all have this situation. (4) Proposing operating losses and requesting exemption from business tax (in fact, operating losses can only exempt income tax). For example, the North China Bone Glue Factory, Chemical Factory, Knitting Factory, Food Chemical Factory, and Tianjin Rubber Factory under the Municipal Industry Bureau believe that the factories are losing money and should be exempt from tax. If this is not possible, they request that it be temporarily recorded in the accounts. (5) Proposing to consult with higher authorities before deciding. Such as the Tianjin Textile Thread Department of the North China Military Supply Production Department, the Automobile Repair Factory, and the China Merchants Bureau, all have this situation. In addition, some enterprises have underreported in their declarations.
    The reason why some state-owned and public enterprises in Tianjin have delayed tax payments is that, in addition to the fact that some enterprises have certain technical difficulties in making declarations due to the temporary difficulty in estimating the value of assets and goods, the main reason is that the persons in charge of these enterprises have insufficient understanding of the national tax work. They believe that paying taxes is a troublesome matter, and it is all public money whether it is paid or not, so why bother paying back and forth. Some units believe that the enterprise is public-owned and should be "special" and "exempted" from paying taxes. Some units think, "I am public-owned, and your tax bureau is also public-owned. You serve the people, and I also serve the people. What does it matter if I delay a bit?" Some units have serious departmentalism, believing that paying taxes affects capital turnover, which in turn affects business development; or that paying taxes will prevent the completion of profit targets, which means that profits cannot be turned over to higher authorities according to the original plan. All these ideas are wrong and must be overcome.

　　对国家税收工作认识不足
    津部分公营企业拖延纳税
    错误思想亟应纠正，国家税法必须遵守
    【本报讯】驻天津特派记者古维进报道：天津市各国营、公营企业，已有一部分按照中央人民政府政务院颁布的工商业税暂行条例及公营企业缴纳工商业税暂行办法，按期申报与缴纳税款，但还有一部分则拖延缴纳一九四九年工商业税，使得天津市的税收计划不能按期完成，影响了国家财政收入。天津市税务局原定二月四日开始国营与公营企业纳税的申报，预定十日截止申报，三月五日则须将全部税收入库。但是实行结果，在二月四日至十日七天内，只有三个单位申报。税务局乃将申报截止期延至二月十六日，也只有六个单位进行申报。税务局乃自二月二十一日起，实行派干部到各企业单位催促申报，但申报者仍不踊跃。据三月十七日统计，全市有一百八十三个公营企业单位（包括外埠驻津采购单位的一部分），申报者只有八十一个单位，其中申报材料完备、可以核税者只有六十四个单位，尚有一百零二个单位未曾申报；据三月二十日统计，全市有八十二个国营企业单位，申报者只有四十二个单位，其中申报材料完备、可以核税者只有十三个单位，尚有四十个单位未曾申报。
    天津市部分国营、公营企业拖延纳税的表现有下列几种：（一）对申报采取不理或搪塞的态度。如中纺公司，一再拖延申报，税务局李局长带领干部到该公司催报，该公司经理及军事代表均不亲自接见，税务局干部乃驻在该公司会计室催报，该公司会计科长曾将损益计算书及资产负债表申报了。该公司总经理对此很不满意，不愿在申报表盖章，并把会计科长批评一顿。（二）回避申报。如外埠驻津采购机关三百五十七个单位中，有二百四十二个在申报期内离津（其中有一部分是因事离开的，当除外），留津的一百一十五个单位中，有三十八个则迁移了地址，一时不易找觅。（三）形式上的申报。——如已申报的四十二个国营企业中，有二十九个单位所申报的材料不完备，不能核税。（四）提出“非营利为目的”，要求免税。如市公用局所属之电车、汽车、自来水公司三个企业单位，及全国总工会所属之“五一”生产社等，均有此种情形。（四）提出经营亏本，要求豁免营业税（其实经营亏本，只能豁免所得税）。如市工业局所属之华北骨胶厂、化学厂、针织厂、食品化学厂、天津橡胶厂等，认为厂子赔钱，应该免税，如果免不了，则要求暂时记账。（五）提出请示上级再说。如华北军需生产部天津纺线部，汽车修配厂，招商局等均有这种情形。另外，有些企业单位，在申报中有少报情形。
    部分津市国营、公营企业之所以发生拖延纳税现象，除有些企业单位由于资产及货物盘存一时难于估价等原因，进行申报时，确实存在若干技术上的困难而外，主要是由于这些企业单位的负责人对于国家税收工作认识不足，他们认为纳税是麻烦的事情，交不交都是公家的，何必交来交去，多此一举；有的单位则认为企业是公家的，应该“特殊”“例外”，不必缴税；有的单位认为，我是公家的，你们税务局也是公家的，你为人民服务，我也是为人民服务，拖延一下有什么关系？有的单位严重存在本位主义。认为纳税影响资金周转，进而影响业务开展；或认为纳税后不能完成利润任务，即不能按原定计划往上级交利润。所有这些思想都是错误的，都必须加以克服。
