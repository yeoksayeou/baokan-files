　　Examination of Wang Yigang's Bureaucratic Errors and Opinions
　　Comrade Wang Yigang was the military representative sent by the Wuhan Military Control Commission to the Wuhan Automobile Factory. The Wuhan Automobile Factory was the former Puppet 403 Automobile Factory, and its engineering and technical conditions were considered relatively good in Wuhan. The factory director, as well as the heads of the engineering, accounting, and materials departments, were all underground party members, and the responsible persons of the trade union preparatory committee were also party members and activists. Among the more than 170 employees, there were 15 party members. The general level of awareness among the masses was not low, and there were very few bad elements (only one had been discovered). Therefore, the political conditions were also considered very good in Wuhan. Under such technical and political conditions, it should have been possible to carry out the task of restoring and developing production happily, and to do a good job in uniting, educating, and organizing the masses. However, due to the extremely bad bureaucracy of Comrade Wang Yigang, the military representative of the factory, a serious phenomenon of widespread low morale among the workers, reduced production quality, bankrupt business credibility, the near absence of customers, alienation of party cadres, and widespread dissatisfaction among the masses was created. This seriously damaged the factory's production and construction, and the Party's prestige among the masses. After being reported by workers, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee sent Comrade Zhang Ming of the Enterprise Party Committee to the factory to investigate. The investigation results are as follows:
　　After entering the factory, Comrade Wang Yigang changed the factory's rules and regulations rashly without studying the specific situation, changing the General Affairs Section to the Administration Section and adding an Investigation and Research Section (it is worth considering whether it is necessary to set up so many institutions in a factory with less than two hundred people). He also abolished the public price list system (this system was: for cars sent to the factory for repair, if the problem could not be identified at the time, the customer would first pay a deposit, and after the car was repaired, the excess or deficiency would be refunded based on the size of the project). When Factory Director Zheng Yichun (an underground party member) raised objections to him, he said: "You are using the Kuomintang's methods, I am using Dalian's experience" (in fact, Comrade Wang Yigang had no direct experience in managing a factory). In early July of last year, Comrade Wang Yigang asked Factory Director Zheng to submit a production plan within a few hours. Factory Director Zheng said that it would be necessary to study the situation carefully and think about it. He said: "What is so great about a plan, a few hours is not enough?" At a meeting to arrange the emergency repair of vehicles, after Comrade Wang Yigang reported his plan, he asked everyone if they had any opinions. When a worker was about to raise an opinion, he sternly stopped him and said: "You just do your own job well, you don't need to say more!" On one occasion, when transporting equipment, Comrade Wang Yigang unilaterally wanted to save freight costs and did not use dock workers to carry it, but contracted it to a unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory to transport it with flatbed trucks. Others told him that the equipment was valuable and required technical handling, and that he should not save these few dollars. He did not listen. As a result, a flatbed truck overturned, damaging more than ninety batteries, resulting in a loss of about four million yuan. The factory's car repair charges were expensive and the technology was bad. A car repaired for the Military Control Commission broke down before it even got home. Comrade Wang Yigang's attitude towards customers was rude, and he did not comply with business regulations. On one occasion, an anti-aircraft artillery regiment sent a car for repair. After it was repaired, he took it into the city without permission. When he returned, he was met by comrades from the regiment who questioned him. He had a very bad attitude and had a big quarrel, almost resorting to violence. As a result, business credibility was bankrupt and customers almost disappeared. For more than two weeks in August, no cars were received for repair, and workers only worked half a day in the afternoon. In a letter of complaint against him, the workers wrote: "We know the Communist Party is good, but why is he so bad? He quarrels with customers. Now the logistics department and other agencies are not coming to repair cars, and we are afraid the factory will close down." In his self-criticism at the branch, Comrade Wang Yigang even used "resolutely completing the task" as one of his strengths.
　　Comrade Wang Yigang's phenomenon of not relying on workers and being divorced from the masses is also seriously manifested in his lack of concern for the workers' hardships, his rude and arbitrary treatment of the masses, and his abuse of administrative power. When paying wages in June of last year, Comrade Wang Yigang arbitrarily violated the principle of "original position, original salary," revised the grades, and reduced wages by nearly one-third. When the results were announced, the workers were greatly dissatisfied, and some thought it was the fault of the head of the engineering department. Last July, wages had been advanced once. When deducting the advance, he violated the instructions of the Military Control Commission and did not deduct the price of rice, cloth, and coal, but only calculated the price of cloth and coal (because the price of rice was low at the time), which aroused opposition from the workers. Fortunately, the Military Control Commission discovered these measures that violated principles and the interests of the masses early and quickly corrected them. At the "July 1st" anniversary celebration last year, the head of the administration department, an old employee of fifty-one years, was a little slow in arranging the venue and did not do it as he wanted. He pointed his finger at the old head and severely reprimanded him. The old head went back and cried, saying: "There is no way, I have to eat." At the "July 1st" anniversary celebration, he also temporarily designated worker Wang Leiqin to speak on stage. Wang Leiqin said: "I am not prepared, what should I say?" He immediately changed his face and said: "I order you to speak!" Wang Leiqin was forced to go on stage. He went so far as to make the drivers unwilling to drive him, the chief steward unwilling to cook for him, and almost all the factory workers were "afraid" of him. The trade union preparatory committee was originally next to his room, and it was often deserted, with no one going there. Later, it moved to another place and immediately became lively. The leader of the work group reminded Comrade Wang Yigang: "Everyone says you are divorced from the masses." He replied: "To do administration is to be divorced from the masses, you should do mass work." Others said he did not talk about democracy, he said: "The workers are too backward, we cannot talk about democracy now." This serious phenomenon of Comrade Wang Yigang being divorced from the masses had a very bad political impact.
  Not relying on the working class, seriously divorced from the masses, extremely bad political influence.
　　Comrade Wang Yigang's attitude towards cadres and comrades was not to actively adopt the policy of unity and help, but to despise and attack them, issue administrative orders, and act like a veteran. He boasted that he was an "old party member" from 1938 and had come from Dalian. He not only had "Dalian's experience" but also "Comintern's experience." He looked down on underground party comrades, saying that their methods were "Kuomintang's." Factory Director Zheng Yichun repeatedly raised objections to him on production issues, but he did not accept them. Instead, he said: "Zheng Yichun is a Kuomintang colonel, has no technology, and relies on that colonel's badge to eat." When entering the city, the Military Control Commission repeatedly instructed on the issue of cadre unity, urging to unite with underground party comrades and respect them. They played a decisive role in leading the masses in the struggle to protect the factory and had generally established prestige among the masses. It was necessary to understand the situation and contact the masses through them. Comrade Wang Yigang forgot all these instructions. He had the same attitude towards the trade union work group comrades. When deciding on wages, a matter directly related to the workers' vital interests, he did not consult with the work group. When he announced his subjective draft, the masses were greatly dissatisfied. Only then did he ask the leader of the work group, Comrade Li Dacheng, to explain. Li said: "Explanation alone is not enough, there are many specific difficulties." He said: "If there are difficulties, you must overcome them!" When Li tried to defend himself further, he said: "I joined the party in 1938 and have a lot more experience. How many meetings have you held? I order you!" This patriarchal style of Comrade Wang Yigang seriously affected the working morale of the cadres and alienated them from each other.
　　Comrade Wang Yigang demanded that his subordinates obey him unconditionally. However, he himself disregarded the organization, disregarded discipline, and even deceived and misled his superiors, and was arrogant and domineering. When discussing wages, he had a big argument with Director Li of the Military Control Commission's Secretariat, and behind his back, he said to others: "What does Li Erzhong amount to!" Even during the period when Comrade Zhang Ming of the Enterprise Party Committee came to the automobile factory to inspect work, he turned around and said: "What qualifications does Zhang Ming have to inspect my work!" Secretary-General He and Secretary-General Yang of the Military Control Commission also called him to talk once. At that time, he wept bitterly, as if he was repentant, but when he returned, he turned around and said: "What do Secretary-General He and Secretary-General Yang amount to!" The automobile factory received two large barrels of gasoline (fifty-three gallons each) from the Military Control Commission. He told the factory director that the Military Control Commission had designated these two barrels of gasoline for his personal use, but in fact, the Military Control Commission had never given this instruction.
　　Before the Enterprise Party Committee came to inspect the work, the branch had already held two meetings to review Comrade Wang Yigang's style. However, Comrade Wang Yigang stubbornly adhered to his own opinions and treated criticism and self-criticism with a bureaucratic attitude. In addition, the underground new party members had not received strict training in party life, and the branch leaders still had some deviations in their thinking, which suppressed the party's criticism and self-criticism and prevented it from being carried out. When Comrade Zhang Ming of the Enterprise Party Committee came to the factory to inspect the work, at the beginning, Comrade Wang Yigang still said: "I don't care, there is nothing great about it." During the inspection, on the one hand, he had individual talks with Comrade Wang Yigang, and on the other hand, he firmly supported the ideological struggle within the party and mobilized party members and the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism. After that, Comrade Wang Yigang's attitude changed somewhat at several review meetings. But when the branch made an assessment, he overturned the mistakes he had admitted, believing that the branch had said too little about his strengths. Later, Secretary-General He of the Military Control Commission talked to him. He admitted his mistakes on the spot, weeping bitterly, but after returning to the factory, he denied them and scolded the leaders: "Only value the workers, not the cadres." Comrade Wang Yigang's back-and-forth attitude showed that he was not aware of his mistakes and that his attitude towards the party was not sincere.
　　When Comrade Zhang Ming went to inspect the work, he listened to the opinions of the workers. The Changjiang Daily and the Huazhong Workers' Daily also published criticisms of Comrade Wang Yigang. This not only restored but also enhanced the Party's prestige among the workers. It made the masses realize the Party's serious, just, and responsible spirit towards the masses. The workers generally reflected that "before, we only knew that the Communist Party was probably good, but this time we saw that the Communist Party is really good."
　　However, the party newspapers and the workers' criticisms not only did not prompt him to reflect more deeply, but instead believed that the newspapers criticized him too severely and harmed his personal dignity, so he looked for loopholes in every word and sentence. He also asked the branch to discuss it again. At the branch meeting, he made many absurd remarks with no stand. He said: "You must be a prescient and enlightened party member, not a confused party member. Only Chairman Mao has no mistakes, and everyone else has mistakes. What the superiors say is not necessarily all right"; he also said, "The Northeast Party and the Wuhan Party are two parties, the Northeast Party is better," and so on. Only under the severe criticism of the branch twice did he reluctantly make some self-criticism to the workers when summarizing the work.
　　The Enterprise Party Committee's inspection results showed that Comrade Wang Yigang's bureaucracy had developed to an extremely serious point. He did not rely on the masses, did not proceed from reality, did not care about the hardships of the workers, and was bureaucratic and commanding towards the masses and cadres, and was unorganized and undisciplined towards his superiors. The Party patiently educated him and helped him, but he was still not humbly reviewing his mistakes and his attitude towards the Party was insincere. Comrade Wang Yigang's serious bureaucracy is a manifestation of extreme petty-bourgeois individual heroism. All he remembered was "eleven years of party membership," "military representatives have the final say," and "Dalian's experience." Carrying these three big burdens, in today's revolutionary victory and development situation, he became ideologically paralyzed and corrupt, complacent, and unwilling to make progress. He regarded himself as an "old" revolutionary, stubbornly clinging to his little experience as a treasure, thinking that all new things did not need to be learned, the masses did not need to be approached, other comrades did not need to be contacted, and the instructions of the superiors could be ignored. If such serious bureaucracy and liberalism are not deeply reflected on from the ideological point of view, the root causes of the mistakes are not thoroughly excavated, and they are not resolutely overcome, and if he still takes a liberal attitude, attempting to mitigate or conceal the mistakes, and passively abandons his work, then Comrade Wang Yigang will block his own path of progress and make himself never have the opportunity to be reformed.

　　Editor's Note: Last August, the Changjiang Daily and the Huazhong Workers' Daily published Wang Yigang's mistakes, but we do not know what happened afterwards. We do not know how the Party and the administration dealt with Wang's mistakes? We also do not know whether Wang Yigang himself made a serious self-criticism, and whether he thoroughly and conscientiously changed his mistakes in his work? What are the specific manifestations? Therefore, although these mistakes occurred in 1949, we believe that it is still necessary to publish them publicly. We hope that the Changjiang Daily can answer the above questions.

### 对王毅刚的官僚主义错误的检查经过和意见

　　对王毅刚的官僚主义错误的检查经过和意见
    王毅刚同志是武汉军管会派驻武汉汽车厂的军事代表。武汉汽车厂是原伪四○三汽车厂，工程技术条件在武汉算是较好的。该厂的厂长、工务、会计、器材等科科长都是地下党员，工会筹备委员会负责人也都是党员和积极分子。一百七十多个职工中，有十五个党员，一般群众觉悟程度不算很低，坏分子极少（还只发现一个），因之政治条件在武汉也算是很好的了。在这样的技术条件和政治条件之下，应该能愉快地进行恢复发展生产的任务，搞好团结、教育和组织群众的工作。可是由于该厂军事代表王毅刚同志的极其恶劣的官僚主义，反而造成了职工生产情绪的普遍低落，生产质量降低，营业信用破产，顾客几至绝迹，党内干部离心离德，党外群众普遍不满的严重现象。严重地损害了该厂的生产建设，和党在群众中的威信。经工人检举后，中共武汉市委特派企业党委张明同志赴该厂调查。调查结果如下：
    王毅刚同志进厂后，不研究具体情况，就轻率地改变厂内制度，把总务科改为行政科，增设调查研究科（不到二百人的工厂，是否需要设立那么多的机构值得考虑），又取消公价单制度（这个制度是：进厂修理的车子，如果当时检查不出毛病所在，就由顾客先摆下一笔定款，等车子修好后，看工程大小多退少补）。厂长郑以纯同志（地下党员）向他提出意见，他就说：“你是国民党的一套，我是大连的经验”（其实，王毅刚同志根本没有直接管理工厂的经验）。去年七月初，王毅刚同志要郑厂长在几个钟头之内提出生产计划。郑厂长说需要好好地研究一下情况，想一想，他说：“一个计划有什么了不起，几个钟头还不够？”某次布置抢修车辆工作的大会上，王毅刚同志报告了自己的计划后，问大家还有什么意见，一个工人正要提意见时，他却又厉声制止说：“你把自己的事做好就得了，不必多说！”有一次搬运器材，王毅刚同志片面地为了节省运费，不要码头工人搬运，包给驻扎该厂的解放军某部用板车搬运，别人和他说器材贵重，搬运要有技术，不要省这几个钱。他不听，结果翻了一辆板车，损坏了九十几个电瓶，损失约达四百万元。该厂修理车子收费贵技术坏，为军管会修理的一部车子，没有开到家就坏了。王毅刚同志对待顾客的态度蛮横，不遵守营业规约。曾有某高射炮团送一部车子去修理，修好后，他擅自坐着进城，回来时被该团同志遇见，向他质问，他态度极坏，大吵一顿，几至动武。这样一来，营业信誉破产，顾客几至绝迹。八月份两个多礼拜，没有接修过一部车子，工人只有下午半天工作。工人在检举他的信中写道：“我们知道共产党好，但是他为什么这样坏呢？他和主顾都吵架。现在后勤部和别的机关都不来修车，我们怕工厂关门。”而王毅刚同志在支部检讨的自我批评中，竟然还以“坚决完成任务”作为自己的优点之一。
    王毅刚同志不依靠工人、脱离群众的现象，同样严重地表现在不关心工人疾苦，对待群众蛮横专断，滥用行政权力。去年六月份发工资时，王毅刚同志擅自违背“原职原薪”的原则，改订等级，削减工资几达三分之一，公布结果，工人大为不满，有的以为是工务科长搞的鬼。去年七月份工资曾预借过一次，扣除借支时，他又违背军管会的指示，不按米、布、煤三种实物折价扣除，而仅以布、煤两种实物计算（因为米价当时低落了），又引起工人反对。这些违反原则，违反群众利益的措施，幸军管会发现得早，才迅予纠正。去年开“七一”纪念大会，行政科科长，五十一岁的老职员，布置会场稍微慢了一点，做得也不大如他的意，他就指着老科长的鼻子严厉斥责，老科长回去后痛哭说：“没有办法，要吃饭”。“七一”纪念大会上，他又临时指定工人王雷钦上台讲话，王雷钦说：“我没有准备，怎么讲？”他立刻变脸的说：“我命令你讲！”王雷钦被迫只好上台。他一直弄到司机不愿给他开汽车，大司务不愿给他做饭，全厂职工几乎都对他望而生“畏”。职工会筹备会原先在他房间隔壁，经常是冷冷清清的，没有人去，后来搬了一个地方，立刻便热闹起来了。工作组组长曾提醒王毅刚同志：“大家都说你脱离群众”，他回答说：“搞行政就是要脱离群众，群众工作要你们去搞”。别人说他不讲民主，他说：“工人太落后，现在还不能讲民主”。王毅刚同志这种严重的脱离群众的现象，产生了极坏的政治影响。
  不依靠工人阶级，严重脱离群众，政治影响极坏。
    对待干部和同志，王毅刚同志不是积极地采取团结和帮助的方针，而是蔑视打击、行政命令、摆老资格。夸耀自己是一九三八年的“老党员”、又是从大连来的，不仅有“大连的经验”，而且有“联共的经验”。他看不起地下党同志，说他们的一套是“国民党的”。该厂厂长郑以纯同志屡次在生产问题上向他提出意见，他都不接受，反而说：“郑以纯是国民党的一个上校，又没有技术，靠那块上校牌子吃饭的”。进城时候，军管会在干部团结问题上再三指示，要团结地下党同志，尊重地下党同志，他们在领导群众护厂斗争中起了决定性的作用，在群众中普遍地建立了威信，要通过他们去了解情况和联系群众。这些指示，王毅刚同志全部忘光了。对待工会工作组同志，他也是同样的态度。在决定工资这样一个直接关系工人切身利益的问题时，他不和工作组商量，等到他公布了他主观制定的草案时，群众大为不满，他才叫工作组组长李大成同志去解释，李说：“光解释不成，有很多具体困难”，他说：“有困难就得克服！”李再想申辩，他就说：“我命令你！”在“七一”纪念大会上，会议中途他要李大成同志领导喊口号，李说：“会还没有完”，他就说：“我一九三八年入党，经验多的多了，你开过几次会？我命令你喊！”王毅刚同志这种家长专制的作风，严重地影响了干部的工作情绪，使干部之间的离心离德。
    王毅刚同志要求下级同志对他无条件服从，他自己对上级，则目无组织，目无纪律甚至欺瞒蒙蔽，骄横跋扈。讨论工资时，他和军管会秘书处李处长大事争吵，背后并对人说：“李尔重算什么！”就在企业党委张明同志到汽车厂检查工作的期间，他一转脸就说：“张明有什么资格来检查我的工作！”军管会何秘书长，杨秘书长也曾调他去谈过一次话。当时他痛哭流涕，好像有痛改前非的样子，可是一回去，又反过来说：“何秘书长，杨秘书长算个什么！”汽车厂在军管会领了两大桶汽油（每桶五十三加仑），他对厂长说这两桶汽油是军管会指定给他私人用的，其实军管会根本就没有过这个指示。
    企业党委未来检查前，支部已开过两次会议检讨王毅刚同志的作风。但王毅刚同志顽固的坚持己见，以官僚主义的态度对待批评与自我批评。加以地下新党员同志没有受过严格的党的生活的锻炼，支部领导人思想上尚有某些偏差，使党内的批评与自我批评受到压制而不能开展。企业党委张明同志到厂检查时，开始，王毅刚同志仍是：“我不在乎，没有什么了不起”。在检查中，一方面与王毅刚同志进行个别谈话，同时坚决支持党内的思想斗争，发动党员群众，展开批评与自我批评。此后几次检讨会上，王毅刚同志的态度有所转变。但到支部鉴定时，他又推翻了自己所承认的错误，认为支部对他的优点说得太少。后军管会何秘书长和他谈话。当场他痛哭流涕的承认错误，但回厂后又否认了，并且谩骂领导：“只重工人，不重干部”。王毅刚同志三翻四复的态度说明了他对自己的错误是不觉悟的，对党的态度也是不忠诚的。
    张明同志去检查工作时，倾听了职工群众的意见。长江日报及华中工人报又登出了对王毅刚同志的批评。这样不但挽回并且提高了党在工人群众中的威信。使群众认识了党的严肃的，公正的，认真向群众负责的精神，工人们普遍地反映“以前光知道共产党大概是好，这一回可看到了共产党是真好。”
    但对王毅刚同志本人，党报与工人的批评，不但没有促使他更深刻的反省，反而认为报纸批评的太重，伤害了他个人的尊严，便在一字一句上找空子。又要求支部重新讨论，在支部会上他发表了许多毫无立场的荒谬言论，他说：“你要做一个先知先觉的党员，不要做一个糊里糊涂的党员，只有毛主席没有错误，剩下的谁都有错误，上级讲的不一定都对”；又说“东北党与武汉党是两个党，东北党好些”等。只是在支部两次的严厉批评下，他才在总结工作时，勉强向工人做了一些自我检讨。
    企业党委检查结果，认为王毅刚同志的官僚主义已经发展到了极其严重的地步，不依靠群众，不从实际出发，不关心工人疾苦，对群众对干部官僚命令，对上级无组织，无纪律。党耐心地教育他，帮助他，而他对自己的错误仍然不虚心检讨，对党的态度不诚恳。王毅刚同志这种严重的官僚主义，是极端的小资产阶级的个人英雄主义的表现。他记得的只是“十一年的党龄”，“军事代表有最后决定权”，“大连的一套经验”。背上了这三个大包袱，在今天革命胜利发展的形势下，思想上麻痹腐化起来，自满自足，不求进步，以“老”革命自居，抱残守缺地将自己的一点经验奉为至宝，以为一切新的事物可以不必学习，群众可以不必接近，其他同志可以不必联系，上级的指示可以置诸脑后。这样严重的官僚主义与自由主义，如果不深刻地从思想上来反省，彻底地挖掘错误的根源，坚决地予以克服，而仍以自由主义的态度，企图减轻或掩饰错误，对工作消极放任，则王毅刚同志就阻塞了自己的进步道路，使自己永无机会得到改造。     
    编者按：去年八月长江日报及华中工人报曾登载了王毅刚的错误，但以后情形，我们还不知道，不知道党和行政对王的错误作了如何处理？也不知道王毅刚本人是否认真作了自我批评，以及是否在工作中彻底认真地改变了他的错误？有何具体表现？因此，虽然这些错误发生在一九四九年，但我们认为仍有公开发表之必要。希望长江日报能答复以上所提的各项问题。
