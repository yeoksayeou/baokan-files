　　Striving to Achieve "A 10% Increase in Production"
    ——A Record of the Production Upsurge Among Liberated Peasants in the Beijing Suburbs
    ·Pei Lan·
    According to the 1950 agricultural production plan proposed by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government, the Beijing suburbs should increase millet production by 15,494,303 jin this year. That is, to increase the average income of farmers by 37.5 jin per person. The Beijing suburbs have a total of 1,044,978 mu of land, with an annual total output of 154,943,030 jin of millet. Is there any certainty of completing the task of "increasing production by 10%" according to the above plan?

    Land reform in the Beijing suburbs has been basically completed, and the peasants have been allocated land and are in high spirits for production. This provides the basic conditions for increasing production. On the other hand, the Beijing suburbs have little land and a large population, so it is necessary to increase fertilizer, promote improved varieties, organize labor mutual aid, cultivate intensively, and develop water conservancy in order to complete the task of increasing production by 10%.

  Driving Carts into the City to Haul Ditch Mud; Manure Piles Everywhere in Every Village
    The source of fertilizer in the suburbs is not very difficult, especially because the Municipal Public Health Bureau has implemented a project to excavate sewers this year, and the fertilizer supply has become more abundant. Since last winter, district and village governments have vigorously mobilized the masses to haul black soil and ditch mud. According to tests, each ton of ditch mud can replace 400 jin of dried manure. The city is estimated to be able to dig out 70,000 tons of ditch mud, which can solve the fertilizer problem for more than 100,000 mu of land.

    Since land reform, the peasants in the Beijing suburbs have been picking up manure, hauling black soil, and hauling ditch mud in groups of three or five every day at the crack of dawn. Since the near completion of land reform in the Bali Zhuang in the 13th district last November, the masses have begun to actively accumulate fertilizer. The village has a total of 120 pushcarts and 50 large carts. In the past three months, the carts have never stopped. Some went into the city twice a day to haul ditch mud, and some carried ditch mud back after selling vegetables. Some who didn't have carts or had carts but no people would team up. Now, when you go to Bali Zhuang, there are manure piles everywhere along the road, on the threshing ground, in the fields, and in the yards. According to preliminary statistics, each mu of land in the village will receive three large cartloads of manure this year, twice as much as last year.

    A Village Head's Production Plan
    Village Head Liu Zhenqing planted six mu of dry land last year, applying one and a half carts of furnace ash and one cart of diluted manure (night soil) per mu. The average yield was 250 jin of corn per mu, for a total of 1,500 jin from six mu. During the land reform, he was allocated another five mu of land, making a total of eleven mu. This year, he has prepared one and a half carts of diluted manure and two carts of furnace ash for each mu of land. In this way, he can harvest at least 300 jin of corn per mu, for a total income of 3,300 jin. If he cultivates intensively, he can harvest 4,000 jin of corn, increasing his income by more than 20% per mu compared to last year. The wealthy peasant Li Tieshan and his brother used to have only one person participating in the main labor. After the land reform, they understood the government's policies, and both brothers actively engaged in production. The younger brother plowed the land, and the older brother drove the cart to haul ditch mud. In three months, they hauled 170-180 large cartloads. The masses in the 14th district of Beijing suburbs have accumulated more fertilizer than in previous years. In addition to the 9 million jin of fertilizer loaned by the government, each mu of land has an average increase of 32 jin of fertilizer. Based on an increase of 10 jin of grain per mu, this can increase millet production by 2,774,200 jin. The masses in the 19th district, in addition to purchasing 1 million jin of horse manure from 43 large stations, also hope to haul some ditch mud and black soil from the city. However, because the district is far from the city, the masses lack livestock. For this reason, the district committee recently convened a meeting of cart household representatives and village heads to study solutions. The district has 800 large carts, most of which are engaged in transportation. Recently, because the sales of coal from Mentougou have not been great, many carts have been idle. The district committee proposed mobilizing 200 large carts to haul ditch mud from the city. It is estimated that hauling for a month can haul more than 3,000 tons. For each ton of ditch mud hauled, the wage is 20 jin of millet for nearby areas, and 25 jin or 28 jin for distant areas. In this way, it solves the problem of labor and livestock feed for the cart drivers, and also solves the difficulty of the masses lacking fertilizer, which makes everyone very satisfied.

    "Exchange Soil for Soil, Break Rocks for Five," advocating topsoil layering. The masses are now being mobilized to apply more sand to clay soil and alkaline soil, and to lay black and red soil on white soil to improve the soil and increase yield.

    In addition, this year the government has issued fertilizer loans of more than 2 million jin of millet. It has now borrowed 3.8 million jin of dried manure from banks and cooperatives and distributed it to the suburbs. It is estimated that 8 million jin of dried manure and 3 million jin of soybean cake (each jin of soybean cake has the effect of 4 jin of dried manure, totaling 12 million jin of dried manure) can be purchased before spring plowing.

    Organized Strength is Great; Hoeing One More Time Can Be Done
    In the past, there were no fixed production mutual aid organizations in the Beijing suburbs. Only during the busy farming season, there was temporary mutual aid between individual relatives and friends, without keeping accounts or returning labor. Last year, the Suburban Committee proposed organizing labor exchange mutual aid groups, and various districts conducted propaganda and organization. Bali Zhuang has a total of 14 li. Last year, when planting wheat, cadres took the lead in organizing mutual aid groups, with two li in each group, and two village cadres leading one group. Men plowed small plots of land, livestock plowed large plots of land, children led livestock, and women picked up stubble. A total of 1,432 mu of wheat was planted. It was originally planned to be completed in ten days, but it was completed in seven days when organized. However, because this organization was too large and did not adopt the principle of voluntary combination, it was not solid and disbanded after planting wheat. However, through this mutual aid wheat planting, the masses have realized the truth that "organized strength is great." This year, the masses are willing to freely form groups for mutual aid. If the masses are mobilized to form mutual aid groups on a voluntary and equal-value basis, the call for "hoeing one more time" proposed by the Suburban Committee this year can be completely achieved, and it can make up for the difficulty of insufficient animal power.

    Farmers Welcome Improved Varieties
    Promoting improved varieties is also one of the main conditions for increasing production. This year, the Suburban Committee will vigorously promote the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato and the small red awn rice seed. These two improved varieties are extremely welcomed by the masses. The "Victory No. 100" sweet potato has a very high yield. According to the results of planting in Changxindian and Fengtai last year, each mu of land can yield 2,500 jin. If the soil quality is good, there is a lot of fertilizer, and more processing is done, more can be harvested. Last year, some villages in Liangxiang harvested 6,000 jin per mu. According to the results of research by the Agricultural Science Research Institute, the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato generally increases production by 84% compared to local sweet potatoes. Local sweet potatoes only yield more than 1,500 jin per mu. Based on a yield of 3,000 jin per mu, each 100 jin of sweet potatoes can be exchanged for 30 jin of corn. 3,000 jin of sweet potatoes can be exchanged for 900 jin of corn, which is more than twice the yield of 300 jin of corn per mu. The small red awn rice seed can yield three dan of rice per mu, equivalent to 900 jin of corn. While ordinary rice seeds yield 1.5 dan of rice per mu, equivalent to 450 jin of corn, an increase of about 100% per mu. Now the government has loaned a total of 620,000 jin of millet for rice seed and sweet potato seed loans. In addition to the loans that can promote 15,000 mu of sweet potatoes and 1,000 mu of small red awn paddy fields, the Beijing Municipal Cooperative also purchased a batch of small red awn rice seeds from the Northeast to exchange with the local rice seeds of the masses. The suburbs plan to promote 24,934 mu of paddy fields this year, which can increase production by 6,233.5 dan of rice, equivalent to 1,870,050 jin of corn. Mass mutual aid can promote 80,000 mu of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes, which can increase production by more than 80 million jin, equivalent to 24 million jin of corn.

  Drilling Artesian Wells; Turning Dry Land into Paddy Fields
    In terms of water conservancy, this year we will concentrate our efforts in places with water sources to drill artesian wells and dredge rivers, repair old wells, and dig new brick wells. The plan now is to dig ditches in Longhe and Tuanhe in Nanyuan and install 63 self-flowing water pipes, each water pipe can irrigate 15 mu of land. Now the masses in Nanyuan and the western suburbs are actively preparing to start construction under the leadership and organization of the government. If the plan is fully realized this year, 19,300 mu of dry land will be turned into paddy fields. The suburban area is low-lying and prone to flooding during heavy rains. The plan is to dig 46 drainage ditches and repair 71 old canals, which can ensure that 120,000 mu of fertile land will not suffer from flooding.

    The Beijing suburbs have long been ravaged by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, and livestock, farm implements, and all daily necessities have been looted. During the land reform, the livestock and farm implements distributed to the peasants were still insufficient for use. The new liberated peasants in the 14th district are still short of more than 1,715 pieces of farm implements. Bali Zhuang in the 13th district has more than 34 qing of cultivated land (including 360 mu of gardens), and the whole village has only 73 livestock (donkeys and mules). Each livestock farms 45.2 mu of land on average. The more than 100 liberated peasant households in the village are still short of 50 hoes, 40 picks, and more than 30 mattocks. These difficulties are mainly solved by mass mutual aid and supplementing labor with organizational labor to compensate for the lack of animal power. The government has issued loans of 500,000 jin of millet for farm implements, livestock, and rubber-tired carts, which can also solve some of the difficulties.

    Combining Sideline Production; Fully Preparing for Spring Plowing
    The suburbs had a poor harvest last year and some areas suffered from flooding. Some farmers do not have enough grain to eat now, which is an urgent problem to be solved in spring plowing production. Chai Zemin of the Suburban Committee repeatedly emphasized when conveying this year's suburban agricultural production plan that, without delaying spring plowing, it is necessary to organize labor to engage in sideline production. Now, work-for-food is being organized for peasants to dig river ditches, and women are being organized to make shoe soles, spin wool, and boil saltpeter. At the same time, preparations are being made to fully launch spring plowing and sowing.

　　为实现“增产一成”而努力
    ——记京郊翻身农民的生产热潮
    ·培蓝·
    根据北京市委、市府郊区工作委员会提出的一九五○年农业生产计划，京郊今年要增产小米一千五百四十九万四千三百零三斤。即要使农民每人平均增加收入三十七斤半。京郊共有土地一百零四万四千九百七十八亩，常年总产量为一亿五千四百九十四万三千零三十斤小米。按上项计划“增产一成”，究竟有没有把握呢？
    北京郊区土地改革基本上已经完成，农民分得了土地，生产情绪很高。这已具备了提高生产的基本条件。另一方面，京郊土地少，人口多，还必须增加肥料，推广优良品种，组织劳动互助，精耕细作，开展水利，才能完成增产一成的任务。
  赶车进城拉沟泥  村村到处是粪堆
    郊区肥料来源还不算十分困难，特别因今年市公共卫生局实施了掏挖下水道的工程，肥料更得到了充足的供应。各区、村政府从去冬起即大力动员群众拉黑土、沟泥。据化验，每吨沟泥可顶粪干四百斤。全市计可挖出七万吨沟泥，能解决十万余亩土地的肥料。
    土地改革后的京郊农民，每天天一明就三五成群的拾粪，拉黑土、拉沟泥。十三区八里庄从去冬十一月土地改革将近结束时，群众便开始积极积肥。该村共有一百二十辆排子车，五十辆大车，三个月来，车子从没有停过，有的一天进城拉两次沟泥，有的卖菜回来背回沟泥。有人没车和有车没人的便搭伙拉。现在到八里庄去，路边、场上、地里、院子里到处都是粪堆。据初步统计，该村今年每亩地要上三大车粪，比去年增加两倍。
    一个村长的生产计划
    村长刘振清，去年种了六亩旱地，每亩上一车半炉灰，一车大粪稀（圊粪），平均每亩收了二百五十斤玉米，六亩地收了一千五百斤。土地改革中他又分了五亩地，共十一亩地，今年已准备好每亩地上一车半大粪稀，两车炉灰。这样，每亩地至少收三百斤玉米，共收入三千三百斤；如再精耕细作，可收到四千斤玉米，比去年每亩收入增加百分之二十以上。富农李铁山弟兄俩，过去只有一个人参加主要劳动，土地改革后了解了政府政策，弟兄俩都积极生产，老二刨地，老大赶大车拉沟泥，三个月拉了一百七、八十大车。京郊十四区群众积肥已超过了往年，加上政府贷肥九百万斤，每亩地平均增加肥料三十二斤，按每亩增产十斤粮，就可增产二百七十七万四千二百斤小米。十九区群众除收购了四十三个大车站的马粪共一百万斤外，还希望到城里拉些沟泥，黑土。但因为该区离城较远，群众缺乏牲口，为此，该区区委会日前特召集本区大车户代表和村长会议研究办法。该区共有八百辆大车，大多是搞运输的，最近因为门头沟煤销路不大，不少大车闲着，区委会提议动员二百辆大车到城里拉沟泥，估计拉一个月，可拉三千多吨。每拉一吨沟泥，近地工资二十斤小米，远地二十五斤、二十八斤不等。这样，既解决了赶大车的人力和牲口的食用问题，又解决了群众缺乏肥料的困难，大家都很满意。
    “土换土、打石五”，提倡客土垒埝。现正动员群众在粘土地、碱土地里多上砂子，白土地垫黑红土，以改良土壤，增加产量。
    此外，今年政府已贷下二百多万斤小米的肥料贷款。现已从银行、合作社贷到三百八十万斤粪干，分发至各郊区，估计到春耕前可买到八百万斤粪干及三百万斤豆饼（每斤豆饼顶四斤粪干的效力，共合粪干一千二百万斤）。
    组织起来力量大  多锄一遍能做到
    京郊过去没有定型的生产互助组织，只是在农忙季节，个别亲友有临时性的互助，不记账，也不还工。去年郊委会曾提出组织拨工互助组，各区都进行了宣传与组织。八里庄共十四个闾，去年种麦子时，干部带头组织互助组，两个闾一组，两个村干部领导一个组。男人刨小块地，牲口耕大块地，小孩牵牲口，妇女拣茬子。共种麦子一千四百三十二亩。原计划十天种完，组织起来七天就种完了。但由于这个组织太庞大，不是采取自愿结合的原则，所以不巩固，种麦后就散了。不过经过这次互助种麦，群众已认识到“组织起来力量大”的真理。今年群众都愿意自由结组互助。如果发动群众，在自愿、等价的基础上组成互助小组，今年郊委所提出的“多锄一遍”的号召，是完全可以作到的，且可以弥补畜力不足的困难。
    农民欢迎优良品种
    推广优良品种，也是增加生产的主要条件之一。今年郊委会将大力推广“胜利一○○号”白薯和小红芒稻种。这两种优良品种，群众极为欢迎。“胜利一○○号”白薯，产量很大，去年长辛店、丰台两地种的结果，每亩地可收二千五百来斤；如果地质好，肥料多，再多加工还可多收。良乡去年有的村子，每亩就有收六千斤的，据农业科学研究所研究结果，“胜利一○○号”白薯，比本地白薯一般增产百分之八十四。本地白薯每亩只收一千五百多斤。仅以每亩收三千斤计算，每一百斤白薯可换三十斤玉米，三千斤白薯就换九百斤玉米，比种玉茭每亩产量三百斤超过两倍。小红芒稻种，每亩可收稻子三石，合玉米九百斤。而一般稻种每亩收稻子一石五斗，合玉米四百五十斤，每亩约可增产一倍。现在政府已贷出稻种、白薯种子贷款共六十二万斤小米。除贷款可推广一万五千亩白薯，一千亩小红芒稻田外，京市合作总社并已从东北购来一批小红芒稻种，与群众的本地稻种交换。郊区计划今年要推广二万四千九百三十四亩稻田，可增产六千二百三十三点五石稻子，合玉米一百八十七万零五十斤。群众互济，可推广八万亩“胜利一○○号”白薯，可增产八千余万斤，合玉米二千四百余万斤。
  开凿自流井  旱地变水田
    在水利方面，今年要集中力量在有水源的地方，开凿自流井和疏浚河流，修理旧井，打新砖井。现在计划在南苑龙河与团河两地挖沟，按装六十三个自流水管，每个水管可灌溉十五亩地。现在南苑、西郊的群众，在政府领导与组织下，正在积极筹备动工。今年计划全部实现，将有一万九千三百亩旱地变为水田。郊区地凹，雨多易涝，计划开凿排水沟四十六条，修旧渠七十一条，可保证十二万亩良田不受涝灾。
    京郊长期在日寇及国民党匪帮的蹂躏下，牲口、农具及一切日用品曾遭洗劫。土地改革中，农民分到的牲口、农具也还不足使用。十四区全区新翻身农民尚缺少农具一千七百一十五件多。十三区八里庄共有耕地三十四顷多（包括三百六十亩园地），全村只有七十三头牲口（驴、骡），每头牲口平均耕地四五·二亩。该村一百来户翻身农民尚缺五十把锄，四十把镐，三十多把刨镐。这些困难，主要以群众互助互济、组织劳力弥补畜力不足等办法来解决，政府已发下的农具、牲畜、翻瓦胶轮等贷款五十万斤小米，也可以解决一部分困难。
    结合副业生产  全力准备春耕
    郊区去年收成不好和有些地区发生涝灾，有的农民当下已没有粮食吃，这是春耕生产中急待解决的问题。郊委柴泽民在传达今年郊区农业生产计划时，一再强调在不误春耕之际，组织劳力搞副业生产，现正以工代赈组织农民挖河沟，组织妇女纳鞋底、纺毛线、熬硝等；同时准备全力展开春耕播种工作。
