　　[This article is a] Comprehensive Report: In the disaster areas of over ten counties including Tongxian and Baodi in Hebei Province, disaster victims, under the leadership of the government, have rushed to plant 400,000 mu of spring wheat. They are now continuing to plant early-maturing crops. Since last year, disaster victims in Tianjin, Tangshan, Cangxian, Baoding, Tongxian, and other special districts, under the strong leadership of the government, have actively dug ditches to drain water and reclaimed a large amount of arable land. In addition to the over 12.9 million mu of autumn wheat already planted in the autumn, the provincial economic conference in January this year also decided to sow 3.5 million mu of early-maturing crops to shorten the spring famine. The counties immediately implemented this decision through people's representative conferences, actively carried out preparatory work, and timely put forward the slogan "Plant early, harvest early, and connect early," breaking the farmers' lax idea that "It's not too late to plant after the fifteenth day of the first month (lunar calendar)." In the first half of February, they seized the opportunity of the half-thawed soil and led the farmers to rush to plant. During the rush planting, various localities paid attention to and solved the following problems: Regarding seeds, in addition to the timely distribution of the large quantities of grain and seeds allocated by the Central People's Government and the Hebei Provincial People's Government, local banks and supply and marketing cooperatives also actively helped solve the seed shortage. For example, the Tianjin, Wen'an, and Dacheng County branches, in conjunction with the supply and marketing cooperatives, went to the Northeast and Northwest to purchase seeds, and adopted the method of lending to order seeds, organizing merchants and civilians in the disaster areas to purchase seeds from outside. In half a month, they purchased more than 3.8 million jin of wheat seeds, ensuring the supply of seeds. In addition, they also fully mobilized self-prepared or freely borrowed seeds to overcome the idea of relying solely on the government. For example, many farmers in the Tianjin Special District solved the seed shortage by free borrowing and selling dead assets. In Baodi's seventh district alone, disaster victims solved 40 percent of the seed problem themselves. Solving the problem of lack of manpower and animal power: Various disaster areas have adopted methods such as allocating labor, mutual aid, people pulling plows, mobilizing women to go to the fields, and the whole family going to the fields, to solve the difficulties caused by the famine. For example, in two districts and eighteen villages in Ninghe, there were 129 mutual aid teams organized. Cadres in Chen Taizi Village, Jinghai, took the lead in joining teams and finished planting more than 800 mu of spring wheat in the whole village in six days. In Yutian County, more than 400 people pulled plows to plant more than 800 mu of wheat. In Ninghe, more than 100 households without livestock planted wheat by exchanging labor. During the wheat planting, various localities also paid attention to combining it with sideline production. For example, Gao Fengpei's transportation team in Gao Village, Wen'an County, had three vehicles running transportation, and there were still people planting wheat at home. Various localities also mobilized the masses to plant wheat for military dependents and famine refugees. For example, the director of the Jiangchang Farmers' Association in Jinghai said, "We are no longer bullied by the Kuomintang bandit army. It was the People's Liberation Army who fought for us. We must first plant for the military dependents." After his call, the mutual aid teams automatically planted for the military dependents first. At the same time, many model military dependents did not need substitute cultivation and went to the fields themselves to rush to plant. Some villages in Wen'an and Jinghai mobilized the masses to plant for the famine refugees on time, and in order not to let those who contributed labor suffer, they agreed that the famine refugees would return the labor or divide the wheat as compensation after they returned. Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned effective measures, the rush planting work was successfully and fully launched. According to incomplete statistics, more than 400,000 mu of spring wheat have been sown in more than ten counties including Tongxian and Baodi alone. However, there are also many shortcomings or errors in various localities, such as individual places violating the lending policy and forcing middle peasants to borrow seeds. Some did not thoroughly organize labor, or only paid attention to production in severely affected areas and relaxed production in lightly affected areas. These have now attracted the attention and correction of leaders in various localities.

　　河北宝坻等十余县灾区
    抢种春麦四十万亩
    【本报讯】综合报道：河北省通县、宝坻等十余县灾民，在政府领导下，已抢种春麦四十万亩。现继续种植早熟作物。天津、唐山、沧县、保定、通县等专区灾民，自去年在政府大力领导下积极挖沟泄水，脱出大量耕地，除去秋已种秋麦一千二百九十多万亩外，今年一月全省经济会议又决议播种三百五十万亩早熟作物，以缩短春荒。各县当即通过人民代表会议贯彻下去，积极进行准备工作，并及时的提出了“早种早收早接口”的口号，打破了农民“过正月十五（旧历）再种也不晚”的松懈思想。在二月间前半月即趁冻半化的时机，领导农民展开抢种。抢种中，各地曾注意与解决了下述几个问题：在种籽方面，各地除将中央人民政府、河北省人民政府拨出的大批贷粮贷种作到及时发放外，各地银行、供销社亦积极帮助解决麦种困难，如天津、文安、大城等县支行结合供销社到东北、西北去买，并采取了贷款订种籽的办法，组织灾区商民到外边购买，半月中即购回麦种三百八十多万斤，保证了种籽的供给。此外还充分发动了自备或自由借贷种籽，以克服单纯依靠政府观点。如天津专区很多农民用自由借贷，变卖死财方法解决了种籽困难，仅宝坻七区灾民自己解决种籽，即达百分之四十。解决人畜力缺乏问题：各灾区均采用了拨工、互助、人拉耧、发动妇女下地、全家下地等办法，解决了为灾荒所造成的人畜缺乏困难。如宁河两个区十八个村，组织起来的互助组就有一百二十九个。静海陈台子村干部领头插伙，六天就把全村八百多亩春麦种完。玉田县有四百多人拉耧种麦达八百多亩。宁河有百余户没牲口，都用人工换的办法种上了麦子。在种麦中，各地还注意了与副业生产的结合进行。如文安县高村高丰培的运输组三辆车跑运输，家里还有人种麦。各地还发动群众，给军属与逃荒户种上了麦子。如静海姜场农会主任说：“我们现在不受国民党匪军的气了，是仗着解放军给打出来的，咱得先给军属种上”。经他一号召，各互助组即自动先给军属上种。同时也有不少的模范军属不用代耕，自己下地抢种。文安、静海有些村子把群众动员起来给逃荒户也按时种上，为了不让出劳力的吃亏，说好逃荒户回来后，用还工或分麦子的办法作为报酬。由于采取了以上各种有效措施，使抢种工作顺利的全面展开。据不完全的统计，仅通县、宝坻等十余县已播种春麦四十多万亩。但各地也存在不少缺点或错误，如个别地方违犯了借贷政策，强迫中农借种。有的不深入组织劳动力，或只注意重灾区生产而放松了轻灾区等，现已引起各地领导注意与纠正。
