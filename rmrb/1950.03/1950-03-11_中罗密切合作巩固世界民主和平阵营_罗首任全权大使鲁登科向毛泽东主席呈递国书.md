Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th: Rudenko, the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Romanian People's Republic to our country, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of our country at 5:00 PM today, accompanied by Counselor Chirade, Secretaries Mentianu and Tautolan. Also present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government's State Council; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When Ambassador Rudenko presented his credentials, he delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a reply.

Ambassador Rudenko's Eulogy

Ambassador Rudenko's eulogy is as follows: Mr. Chairman:

Today, I am carrying out the lofty and pleasant task entrusted to me by the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, representing the Romanian People's Republic to present my credentials to Your Excellency, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. I feel very honored.

The Romanian people and their government hold admiration and sincere friendship for the great Chinese people and their beautiful country.

The heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people has attracted and continues to attract the concern and attention of our entire people.

The great victory of the War of Liberation and the proclamation of the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to being a serious defeat for the imperialist warmongers and their servants across the ocean—the traitors to the Chinese people within the country—is also a new and brilliant victory for the world's democratic peace camp, because it has greatly expanded and consolidated this camp.

The Romanian people are proud to actively participate in this powerful democratic peace camp.

Because the victorious Soviet army annihilated the German fascist group and its running dogs on our territory, the Romanian people, liberated in 1944, were able to take control of their own destiny, smoothly continue the struggle to eliminate the remnants of the internal reactionaries who were protected and encouraged by foreign Anglo-American imperialism, and are now working with excitement and encouragement in factories and fields to build a new life, resolutely embarking on the road of socialist construction.

On this broad road, the great Soviet Union, in the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance concluded two years ago between our young Romanian People's Republic and the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, provides us with friendship and selfless assistance in all possible forms.

The Romanian people are particularly pleased that the treaty and agreements recently signed in Moscow between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Government are powerful instruments of peace and friendship between nations, and at the same time, a firm guarantee that the heroic and hardworking Chinese people, as they proved in the War of Liberation, will be able to achieve brilliant victories on the front of restoring and developing the people's economy and the people's culture under the leadership of their wise leader.

The Romanian people and their government, united with the same great neighbor and common friend—the Soviet Union—by a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, express their firm will and belief: the relations we have closely established will consolidate and develop into beneficial friendship and cooperation between our two countries, and will benefit our two peoples, and will be conducive to the consolidation of the entire democratic peace camp headed by the invincible Soviet Union, which is the fortress and guarantee of the freedom, independence, and national sovereignty of all peace-loving people.

Based on this policy, I will contribute all my strength and labor, as well as my loyalty to our common cause, to consolidate and develop the friendship and various forms of cooperation between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people.

I am deeply convinced that Your Excellency and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will give me benevolent and friendly assistance so that I can accomplish the mission given to me by my government.

Long live the great Chinese people and the People's Republic of China!

Long live the permanent friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic!

Chairman Mao's Reply

Chairman Mao Zedong's reply is as follows: Mr. Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by Your Excellency, Ambassador of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, and thank Your Excellency for your congratulations.

Since the end of the World Anti-Fascist War, the resolute struggle waged by the Romanian people against domestic and foreign reactionaries, and the economic construction work they are currently diligently engaged in and have achieved brilliant achievements, have always been deeply concerned and admired by the Chinese people.

Today, the governments and peoples of China and Romania are working hard for the common goal of world peace. I believe that the increasingly close cooperation between China and Romania in the political, economic, and cultural fields will be beneficial to the peoples of both countries, and will further consolidate and strengthen the strength of the world's democratic peace camp.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency to serve as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to provide various forms of assistance to Your Excellency in your work to consolidate the friendship between the two countries.

I wish your country prosperity, your people prosperity, and the health of your head of state. (Attached picture)

　　中罗密切合作巩固世界民主和平阵营
    罗首任全权大使鲁登科向毛泽东主席呈递国书
    【新华社北京十日电】罗马尼亚人民共和国驻我国首任特命全权大使鲁登科，于今日下午五时偕参事席拉德，秘书孟天努、陶托兰，向我国中央人民政府毛泽东主席呈递国书。在场的有中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部长周恩来，中国人民解放军代总参谋长聂荣臻，外交部办公厅主任王炳南，中央人民政府典礼局长余心清，外交部交际处长王倬如。鲁登科大使呈递国书时曾向毛泽东主席致颂词，毛泽东主席致答词。
    鲁登科大使颂词
    鲁登科大使的颂词如下：主席先生：
    今天我奉罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团的命令，负着崇高而愉快的任务，以特命全权大使的资格，代表罗马尼亚人民共和国向中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席阁下呈递国书，感到非常荣幸。
    罗马尼亚人民及其政府，对于伟大的中国人民及其优美的国家怀着钦佩与纯真的友情。
    中国人民英勇的解放斗争吸引了并吸引着我们全国人民的关切与注意。
    解放战争的伟大胜利与中华人民共和国之宣告成立，除了对于大洋彼岸的帝国主义者战争贩子及其仆从——中国内部的人民叛徒们说来是一个严重的失败以外，同时也是全世界和平民主阵线的新的辉煌胜利，因为它使这一阵线大大地扩大与巩固起来。
    罗马尼亚人民因为积极参加这一强大的和平民主阵线而感到骄傲。
    由于胜利的苏军在我国领土上歼灭了德国法西斯集团及其走狗以后，使在一九四四年获得解放的罗马尼亚人民才能够掌握自己的命运，顺利地继续为肃清那些得到外来的英美帝国主义的庇护与鼓励的内部反动派残余而斗争，和目前在工厂中、田野上为建设新生活而兴奋鼓舞地工作，坚决地踏上社会主义建设的道路。
    在这条广阔的道路上，伟大的苏联本着两年前在我们年青的罗马尼亚人民共和国与伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟间所缔结的友好合作互助条约的精神，在一切可能的形式之下，给予我们以友谊和无私的援助。
    罗马尼亚人民特别高兴的是最近中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府之间在莫斯科所签订的条约和协定，是各民族之间强有力的和平友好的工具，同时，又是一个坚强的保证，使英勇和勤劳的中国人民，正如他在解放战争所证明了的一样，能够在自己英明领袖的领导之下，获得在恢复与发展人民经济和人民文化的战线上的辉煌的胜利。
    与同一伟大的邻邦和共同的朋友——苏联缔结友好合作互助条约而团结一致的罗马尼亚人民及其政府，表示自己坚决的意志和信念：我们已经亲密地建立起来的关系，将巩固并发展为我们两国间有益的友谊与合作，而有利于我们两国人民，有利于以不可战胜的苏联为首的整个和平民主阵线之巩固，苏联是一切爱好和平人民的自由、独立与民族主权的堡垒与保障。
    根据这个政策，我将贡献出我的全部力量和劳动，以及对于我们共同事业的忠心，来巩固和发展罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间的友谊与各种合作。
    我深信阁下和中华人民共和国中央人民政府将给我以善意与友谊的协助，使我能够完成我的政府所给予我的使命。
    伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国万岁！
    中华人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国之间的永久友谊万岁！
  毛主席答词
    毛泽东主席的答词如下：大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受贵大使所呈递的罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团的国书，并感谢贵大使的祝贺。
    世界反法西斯大战之后，罗马尼亚人民与国内外反动派所进行的坚决斗争及目前正在勤劳从事并已获得辉煌成就的经济建设工作，一向为中国人民所深切关怀与钦佩。
    今天，中罗两国政府及人民正在为世界和平的共同目标而努力奋斗。我相信，中罗两国在政治、经济及文化方面的益加密切的合作，必将有利于两国人民，且将更加巩固与加强世界民主和平阵营的力量。
    我热烈欢迎贵大使出任罗马尼亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国首任特命全权大使，并愿在贵大使巩固两国友谊的工作中，予以各种协助。
    谨祝贵国国家繁荣、人民兴旺、贵国元首健康。（附图片）
