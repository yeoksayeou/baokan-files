[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Public Health Bureau has been vigorously carrying out key vaccinations this spring, and has inoculated over 110,000 people to date. From January to the present, there have been only six smallpox cases, which is one-sixteenth of the number in the same period last year. The results are significant, and some experience has been gained from the key vaccinations.

This spring, urban area vaccinations began earlier than last year, on December 21, and were carried out separately by the Public Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Team and various municipal hospitals and health clinics. The Epidemic Prevention Team also carried out door-to-door vaccinations in various districts, and all newborns, children under two years old who had not been vaccinated, and new residents moving into the city from outside were vaccinated. By the end of February this year, urban area vaccinations had been basically completed, with a total of more than 50,000 people vaccinated. In addition to continued booster shots by various hospitals and clinics, private hospitals and clinics have also been entrusted to assist in order to completely complete the urban area vaccination work. As of the 17th of this month, a total of 62,404 people have been vaccinated, including 12,719 initial vaccinations and 49,685 revaccinations.

Suburban vaccinations have started slightly later than in the urban area, as there are few health agencies in each district and it is necessary to transfer personnel from the Epidemic Prevention Team after the urban area work is largely completed. Before the completion of the key vaccination work in the urban area at the end of February, the bureau arranged to establish additional suburban epidemic prevention stations. Nine stations were set up separately in the East Suburbs, South Suburbs, Fengtai, Haidian, Qinglongqiao, North Suburbs, Changxindian, Beixin'an, Mentougou, etc. Each station has a chief physician and six to nine epidemic prevention workers, and all were established and started work before the end of February. As of the 15th of this month, the total number of people vaccinated at each station reached 52,477, including 1,821 initial vaccinations and 50,656 revaccinations.

This year, the bureau's vaccination work adopted a focused, planned, and pragmatic approach. Those who should be vaccinated, such as newborns, must be vaccinated, and those who do not need to be vaccinated are not vaccinated. After vaccination, the results must be checked and recorded one by one and saved as a basis for evaluation, so as not to let the work become a mere formality and waste manpower and resources.

According to the experience gained from this year's vaccinations, due to the widespread vaccination of newborns in the urban and suburban areas this year, 11,590 children under one year old have been vaccinated in the urban area. From the end of January to the present, no infants under one year old in the urban area have contracted smallpox. In the suburbs, only one infant over two months old outside Guang'anmen developed smallpox. This is compared to the statistics of smallpox patients in this city last year—one infant of twenty days old, one of twenty-four days old, one of one month old, three of two months old, ten of three to four months old, and eleven of five to six months old—it is clear that universal vaccination of newborns has achieved preliminary results in preventing the occurrence of smallpox. The preventive effect is also extremely significant in the general adult population. In the process of implementing smallpox prevention vaccinations this year, only four smallpox cases occurred in the city in January, none were found in February, and one patient was found in the urban and suburban areas in mid-March. A total of six smallpox cases have occurred in the city so far this year. Compared with the same period last year, when a total of 92 smallpox cases occurred, it is sufficient to prove that the epidemic prevention and vaccination work in Beijing this spring has made good progress compared with last year.

　　京卫生局大力防止天花
    重点种痘十一万人
    截至目前城区一岁以下幼儿无一患者
    【京市新闻处讯】京市公共卫生局今年春季大力进行重点种痘，截至目前止已经接种十一万余人。自今年一月至目前止，天花患者仅有六名，相当去年同一时期的十六分之一，成绩显著，并且获得重点种痘的若干经验。
    今春城区种痘早于去年十二月二十一日由公共卫生局防疫队及各市立医院和卫生所分别进行，防疫队并向各区实行挨户接种，凡初生儿二年以内未种痘及新由市外迁入市内居住者概行种痘。至本年二月底止，城区种痘已基本完成，接种人数共达五万余人。现除由各院、所继续补种外，并嘱托各私立医院诊所帮同进行，以期彻底完成城区种痘工作。截至本月十七日止，前后共接种六万二千四百零四人，其中初种一万二千七百一十九人，复种四万九千六百八十五人。
    郊区种痘，因各区卫生机关很少，须俟城区工作大致完成后改调防疫队人员前往进行，故开始较城区稍迟。二月底城区重点种痘工作完成前，该局即布置增设郊区防疫站，计在东郊、南郊、丰台、海甸、青龙桥、北郊、长辛店、北辛安、门头沟等处分设九个站。每站设主任医师一人，防疫员六至九人，于二月底以前全部设立完成并即开始工作。截至本月十五日止，各站种痘人数，总计共达五万二千四百七十七人，其中初种一千八百二十一人，复种五万零六百五十六人。
    该局本年种痘工作，采取了重点有计划和实事求是方针。凡初生儿等应当种者必须种，不需要种者不种。种过之后，必须检查结果，并一一记录下来，加以保存，作考查根据，以免工作流于形式，浪费人力物力。
    根据今年种痘所得经验，本年城郊区初生儿因曾进行普遍接种，一岁以下儿童城区接种者一万一千五百九十人，自一月底至现在止，城区一岁以下幼儿无一患天花病者，郊区方面仅广安门外有一名两个多月的幼儿发生天花。此与去年本市天花患者统计——出生二十天的婴儿一人，二十四天的一人，一个月的一人，两个月的三人，三到四个月的十人，五到六个月的十一人——两相比较，显然初生儿普遍种痘，对预防天花发生已收到初步效果。在一般成人方面，预防效果亦极显著。本年在实行天花预防接种过程中，一月份全市发生天花患者仅四名，二月份无发现，三月中城郊区各发现患者一名，全市本年截至最近止，总共发生天花患者六名，与去年同期相较，去年则共发生天花患者达九十二名之多，足证京市本年春季防疫种痘工作，较去年已有良好进展。
