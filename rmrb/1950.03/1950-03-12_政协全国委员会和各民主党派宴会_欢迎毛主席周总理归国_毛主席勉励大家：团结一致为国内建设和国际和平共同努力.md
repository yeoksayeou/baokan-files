Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and various democratic parties held a banquet this evening to welcome Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai's return to China. Invited to the banquet were Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and comrades Shi Zhe, Ye Zilong, Wang Dongxing, and Lai Yali, who recently returned from a visit to the Soviet Union. Also invited as companions were approximately 140 people, including leading figures from the Central People's Government, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, leaders of various people's organizations, and responsible personnel from the Party, government, and military organs in Beijing. An evening party was held after the banquet.

　　Vice Chairman Li Jishen delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet, saying: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is a success of Chairman Mao's policy of leaning to one side, towards the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and also a success of Marshal Stalin's consistent peaceful foreign policy towards China over the years. The U.S. imperialism and its accomplices have in the past tried every possible means to fabricate rumors, provoke, and sow discord, attempting to sabotage the conspiracy of friendship and unity between the people of the two major allies, China and the Soviet Union, which has now been completely shattered. The 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union are more closely united, which not only consolidates the foundation of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and promotes the speed of economic and cultural construction in New China, but also lays the foundation for the people's democratic peace in the East and strengthens the democratic front of the people of the whole world. Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: In the future, only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, faithfully fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the new Sino-Soviet Treaty, further developing and consolidating the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and learning from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building can we complete the great cause of New Democracy construction and strive for the people's democracy and peace of the whole world. On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties, I would like to express my heartfelt love and infinite sincerity to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for their hard work and long journeys for the country and the people, and express my highest respect. At the same time, we express our sincere gratitude to Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people.

　　Chairman Mao expressed his gratitude to Vice Chairman Li and the welcome from various parties and organizations, and encouraged everyone to unite and work together for domestic construction and international peace.

　　Vice Premier Guo Moruo delivered a welcoming speech at the opening of the evening party. He said: Unity is strength. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has turned 700 million people into a hammer, enough to resist any imperialist aggression. The help given to the Chinese people by the great ally, the Soviet Union, is unprecedented in Chinese history. We should thank Marshal Stalin for his concern and care for the Chinese people, and thank the Soviet people for their fraternal friendship. (Attached picture)

    毛主席勉励大家：团结一致为国内建设和国际和平共同努力
    【新华社北京十一日电】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各民主党派于本日晚间举行宴会，欢迎毛泽东主席和周恩来总理归国。应邀赴宴的有最近访苏归来的毛泽东主席、周恩来总理及师哲、叶子龙、汪东兴、赖亚力等。应邀作陪的，有中央人民政府各首长、中国人民解放军的高级将领、各人民团体的领袖和北京市的党政军机关负责人员等约一百四十余人。在宴会后举行了晚会。
    李济深副主席在宴会上致欢迎词说：中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，是毛主席向以苏联为首的和平民主阵线一边倒的政策的成功，也是斯大林大元帅对中国多年来一贯的和平外交政策的成功。美帝国主义及其帮凶过去千方百计地造谣、挑拨、离间，企图破坏中苏两大盟国人民的友爱、团结的阴谋诡计，现在已被彻底地粉碎了。中苏两国七万万人民更紧密地团结在一起，不只巩固了中国人民民主革命的基础，促进了新中国经济、文化建设的速度，而且奠定了东方人民民主和平的基础，加强了全世界人民民主的阵线。李济深副主席说：我们今后只有在毛主席及中国共产党的领导下，忠诚履行中苏新约规定的义务，更进一步发展和巩固中苏两国友谊，学习苏联的建国经验，才能完成新民主主义建设的大业，才能争取全世界的人民民主与和平。我代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会及各民主党派，谨以满腔热爱与无限的挚诚，对毛主席和周总理为国家和人民，长途跋涉的辛勤劳苦，表示万分的感激，并致最崇高的敬意，同时我们对斯大林大元帅和苏联人民表示至诚的谢意。
    毛主席对李副主席及各党派各团体的欢迎表示谢意，并勉励大家团结一致为国内建设和国际和平而共同努力。
    郭沫若副总理在晚会开幕时致欢迎词。他说：团结就是力量。中苏友好同盟互助条约把七万万的人民，一下变成了一个铁锤，足以抵抗任何帝国主义的侵略。伟大盟邦苏联给中国人民的帮助，是中国历史上所没有前例的。我们应该感谢斯大林大元帅对中国人民的关怀照顾，感谢苏联人民兄弟般的友谊。（附图片）
