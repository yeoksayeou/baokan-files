　　Several Experiences in Cultural Education of a Certain Division in Northeast China
　　Our Correspondent Bai Feng
　　A certain division of the North China Military Region has achieved considerable success in both cultural and political education during the first training period. For example, soldier Chen Shibin learned more than 2,000 characters in seven months and transformed from being illiterate to a correspondent for the unit's newspaper. Many teachers, soldiers, and cadres diligently studied teaching and learning methods. Here are some experiences related to cultural education summarized from typical teaching reports:
  How to Teach?
　　(1) First, cultural teachers must establish the idea of serving the soldiers, integrate with them, and teach patiently with a responsible attitude, overcome the difficulties encountered in teaching, and create teaching methods that help soldiers learn. This is the basic condition for making teaching effective. Hao Ruisheng, a cultural teacher in a certain regiment, and Wu Shangbin and Chu Zhihe, cultural teachers in other units, all possessed these conditions. They often solicited everyone's opinions, researched and improved teaching methods, so they were of the greatest help to the soldiers, and their lectures were also the most popular among the soldiers.
　　(2) The teaching content should be closely integrated with practice, grasping the spirit of "teach what is needed" and "learning for application." This is the only way to improve the soldiers' learning enthusiasm and achieve greater results. Comrade Hao Ruisheng grasped this spirit in his Chinese language teaching, from talking about articles and teaching writing to teaching grammar. For example, in teaching grammar, he adopted a two-person dialogue approach, pointing out and correcting the soldiers' grammatical errors from the dialogue; in teaching writing, he asked the soldiers to write about their own lives and thoughts. He carefully revised according to the soldiers' actual level. In addition, he used praise as the main method to inspire the soldiers' learning enthusiasm. As a result, in the three months of formal education, among the soldiers he taught, the number of those who could write letters home increased from 54 to 125; the number of those who could write wall newspaper articles increased from 74 to 104.
　　(3) In terms of teaching methods, these typical reports provide many successful experiences: Comrade Wu Shangbin adopted the image teaching method in teaching literacy lessons. For example, when teaching the word "blind," he first made a blind person's expression, then taught it stroke by stroke, and then gave a careful explanation. Because the teaching of literacy was accompanied by facial expressions and movements, it easily aroused the soldiers' interest, did not feel boring, and made the soldiers remember deeply. Some teachers used the character decomposition teaching method. For example, when teaching the word "guide," they explained the words "head," "way," and "inch" separately. In this way, four words can be taught together. Some teachers used the comparison teaching method: for example, when teaching the word "up," they also taught the word "down"; when teaching the word "black," they also taught the word "white." In this way, it can also help with memory.
　　Experience has proven that teaching soldiers to memorize individual characters is a very inefficient teaching method. When teaching a word or a phrase, it is best to link it with the soldiers' lives, the soldiers' language, or the content of the text, and form simple sentences. For example, when teaching the words "People's Liberation Army," you can link them into the sentence "I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army" and explain the usage of each word in this sentence. The soldiers will not only remember it easily, but also learn the usage of each word. This point is even more important for Class A and B, which already have a foundation in literacy.
　　(4) Organizing "little teacher" mutual learning and teaching, launching a mass "mutual testing and questioning," and "mutual evaluation of assignments" to create a mass learning upsurge can supplement the teacher's explanations, supervision, and inspections. In the first training period, the soldiers spontaneously launched a "mutual testing and questioning" movement, without any formality or restrictions. Zhang San met Li Si, and they could have a "mutual testing and questioning" at any place, which greatly helped everyone's learning. Comrade Wu Shangbin mastered the above methods, which not only accelerated the learning progress of ordinary soldiers, but also improved the learning of some soldiers with poor memory.
　　In addition, being good at using wall newspapers, soldiers acting as soldiers, soldiers drawing soldiers, radio stations, blackboard newspapers, and other forms to commend learning models and introduce learning experiences is also an effective method to help teaching and promote soldiers' learning.
  How to Learn?
　　(1) Learning requires perseverance and persistence. In the initial stage of learning culture, two tendencies are extremely easy to appear: one is impatience, wanting to learn a lot of things at once, and getting anxious when encountering difficulties or difficult-to-remember characters, which affects the learning mood; the other is dejection, thinking that they are "stupid" or "too old" and cannot learn well. Both of these emotions must be corrected in time. Facts have proven that with determination and perseverance, you can learn well. For example, the 52-year-old cook Liu Shanming had been in the Kuomintang army for 20 years and did not know a single character. Now, he bought reading glasses and learned while cooking. In three months, he learned 500 characters, 300 of which he could "four meet." This time, he was also honorably elected as a division worker-student representative.
　　(2) Combine learning with life, learn what you do, and learn what you see. For example, soldier Li Yushen wrote the words "land reclamation" on his hoe when reclaiming land; when he went to the field to collect firewood, he learned the word "firewood," and when he saw a dog, he learned the word "dog." He wrote the words he had learned in a notebook and drew a picture below so that he could remember them from the picture when he forgot. Because of this, he has learned more than 600 characters.
　　(3) Carefully do the assignments left by the teacher. For the places deleted and modified by the teacher, study them carefully. If you don't understand, go to the teacher to talk and discuss with comrades. Pay attention to errors in the text and don't repeat them next time.
　　(4) Think of ways to overcome difficulties in learning. For example, when material conditions are difficult, Comrade Li Yushen uses a piece of paper to write words twice, first with a pencil and then with a pen; when there is not enough time to study, he seizes every opportunity to ask others, and sometimes writes words on his stomach with his fingers in the quilt and practices several times at night, remembering them as soon as he gets up the next day. He adopted this method to review the words he learned during the day and learned more than 500 words in three months.

　　东北某师文化教育的几点经验
    本报通讯员  白烽
    华北军区某师在第一期练兵中，文化教育和政治教育都获得了不少成绩。如战士陈世彬，在七个月中学会了两千多个字，由文盲变成部队报纸的通讯员。许多教员与战士、干部，苦心钻研教与学的方法。这里是从教学典型报告中总结的几点有关文化教育的经验：
  怎样教？
    （一）首先，文化教员必须树立为兵服务的思想，与战士打成一片，以对同志负责的态度耐心地教，克服教学中所遇到的困难，创造有助于战士学习的教学方法。这是使教学收效的基本条件。某团文化教员郝瑞生，另部文化教员武尚斌和楚志和，都具备了这样的条件。他们经常征求大家的意见，研究和改进教学方法，因此，他们对战士的帮助最大，他们讲课也最受战士欢迎。
    （二）教学内容要紧紧结合实际，掌握“作什么教什么”、“学以致用”的精神，这样才能提高战士的学习情绪，收效也大。郝瑞生同志在国文教学中，从谈文章、教写作到教语法，都掌握了这种精神。例如他在教语法中，采取二人对话的方式，从对话中指出并纠正战士的语病；在教写作中，要战士写自己的生活和思想。他根据战士的实际水平，认真地修改。此外，他用表扬为主的方法，启发了战士的学习情绪。因此，三个月的正规教育，在他所教的战士中，能写家信的由五十四人增至一百二十五人；写墙报稿的由七十四人增至一百零四人。
    （三）在教学方法上，这些典型报告中提供了许多成功的经验：武尚斌同志教识字课，采用了形象教学法：例如教“盲”字，自己首先装成瞎子的表情，然后一笔一画地教，再加以细心的讲解。由于教识字时加上了表情动作，容易引起战士的兴趣，不感觉枯燥，并使战士记忆深刻。有的教员采用拆字教学法，例如教“导”字时，分别讲解“首”、“道”、“寸”等字，这样，可以联系在一起教四个字。有的采用对比教学法：如教“上”字时再告诉一个“下”字；教“黑”字时联系教“白”字，这样，也可以帮助记忆。
    经验证明，教战士死记单字是效率很低的教学方法。教一个字或一个词的时候，最好联系战士的生活、战士的语言或课文的内容，联成简单的句子。例如教“人民解放军”几个字，可以联成“我是人民解放军的战士”一句话，解释每个字在这一句中的用法，战士们不独容易记，而且学会了各个字的用法。这一点，对于已有识字基础的甲、乙班，更为重要。
    （四）组织小先生互学互教，发动群众性的“互测互问”，“互评作业”，造成群众性的学习热潮，可以补助教员讲解、督促、检查的不足。在第一期练兵中，战士们自发搞起了“互测互问”运动，不拘形式，不受任何限制，张三碰着李四，在任何地方就可以来一次“互测互问”，对大家学习的帮助很大。武尚斌同志掌握了上述这些方法，不独使一般战士学习进步加快，也把一些记忆力较差的战士的学习搞好了。
    此外，善于利用墙报、兵演兵、兵画兵、广播台、黑板报等形式，表扬学习模范，介绍学习经验，也是帮助教学，推动战士学习的有效方法。
    怎样学？
    （一）学习要有毅力，有恒心。在初学文化时，两种偏向极容易出现：一种是急躁，想一下子学很多东西，遇到困难或难记的字就着急，影响学习情绪；另一种是垂头丧气，认为自己“心笨”或“年纪大了”，学不好。这两种情绪都要及时纠正。事实证明，有决心有毅力就能学好。例如五十二岁的炊事员刘善明，在国民党军队里干了二十年，一字不识。现在，他买了老花眼镜，一面作饭一面学习，三个月里学会了五百个字，其中有三百个字作到了“四会”。这次他并光荣地当选为师工学代表。
    （二）学习与生活结合，干什么学什么，见什么学什么。如战士李玉深，开荒时把“开荒”两字写在镐锄上；到地里去打柴就学“柴”字，见了狗就学“狗”字。他把学了的字写在本子上，下面画一个图，忘了时可从图上记起来。由于这样，他已学会了六百多个字。
    （三）细心做好教员留下的作业，对于教员删改的地方，要仔细研究，不懂时去找教员谈，和同志们讨论，留心文字中的错误，下次不重犯。
    （四）想办法克服学习中的困难。例如物质条件困难，李玉申同志就利用一张纸写两次字，先使铅笔，后使钢笔；学习的时间不够，他随时抓紧机会问别人，有时在被窝里用手指在肚皮上写字，夜间练习几次，第二天一起床就记住了。他采取了这个方法，复习白天学习的字，三个月学了五百多个字。
