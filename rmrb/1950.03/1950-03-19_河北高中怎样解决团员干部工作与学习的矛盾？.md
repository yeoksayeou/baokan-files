How Hebei High School Solves the Contradiction Between League Cadre Work and Study?
    Zheng Shijun

    The contradiction between work and study was most severe in Hebei High School (i.e., Ji High) before last summer vacation. This contradiction mainly existed among the cadres of the student union and the Communist Youth League. For example, Liu Pengzhi, the chairman of the student union, was also the deputy secretary of the Youth League branch, a member of the student aid fund management committee, and the deputy director of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Preparatory Committee. In addition to these tasks (including meetings), he also had to regularly attend school administrative meetings such as the school affairs meeting and the teaching affairs meeting. According to statistics at the time, a Youth League branch committee member sometimes had to attend twelve and a half hours of meetings a week. Many clubs also delayed regular classes to rehearse plays and sing songs. Some activists felt that there was a contradiction between work and study.

    The emergence of this contradiction had its objective reasons. For example, immediately after liberation, they had not yet found good working methods. Meetings were not well-run, wasting a lot of time and solving very few problems. On the other hand, there were also some ideological problems. The most important one was: thinking that cultural learning was not important, that the old system was completely undesirable, waiting for the reform of the education system, and subjectively opposing work and study. At that time, most of the cadres of various departments were Youth League members, but they did not clarify that the task of the Youth League in the school was to unite teachers and students and do a good job in study. They thought that the task of the Youth League in the school was to mobilize students to attend meetings, develop the organization, etc., and neglected the basic tasks of the League.

    At that time, the students' response to the Youth League was: Youth League members did not pay attention to cultural learning. Therefore, many people were afraid of hindering their studies and did not join the League, which also hindered the development of the League.

    After the summer study, everyone's political level and working methods have improved a step further. The Youth League first clearly put forward that the task of the League in the school is to unite teachers and students and do a good job in study. This made everyone subjectively pay attention to study, and also took the initiative to seize the time and allocate time. Especially after the school proposed to carry out New Democracy study, everyone understood that a good student of New Democracy must have three conditions: progressive thinking, active learning, and good health. Everyone checked themselves against these three conditions, and thus paid more attention to study. At this time, the League also got a great development. Everyone realized that only when League members and students work together to do a good job in study can the League develop normally.

    In overcoming the contradiction between work and study, we have the following experiences:

    1. Solve ideological problems: Criticize the erroneous ideas of waiting for the reform of the education system, neglecting cultural learning, and subjectively opposing work and study. At the same time, because most of the school cadres are Youth League members, it must be clearly pointed out what the basic task of the Youth League in the school is. If these ideological problems are not solved, the contradiction between work and study cannot be solved. On this issue, we must carefully study the Municipal Party Committee's report on solving the contradiction between work and study and the decision on the task of the Youth League in schools.

    2. Avoid excessive concurrent positions: This phenomenon was very serious in our school last semester. There were many phenomena of one person holding several positions. Now it is different. There is much more work this semester than last semester, with the addition of organizations such as the consumer cooperative and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Youth League organization has also expanded from one branch to twelve branches, and a general branch has been established, but the number of students participating in work has also greatly increased. Now about 80% of the total number of students in the school participate in work of all sizes. For example, in Class 1 of Second Ding, out of 45 people, excluding 4 commuting students and 3 sick people, 35 out of the remaining 37 people have work. Although there are many things, everyone shares the burden, so it will not affect the study, and the work will be done well.

    3. Streamline meetings: That is, establish a meeting system, do not hold unprepared meetings, spend less time, but can solve many problems. For example, the Youth League General Branch used to take at least two hours for a meeting; after streamlining the meeting, the general meeting does not exceed one hour. When summarizing a month's work, notify the various departments one week in advance to prepare early, and the problems will be solved quickly at the meeting.

    4. Fine division of labor: Don't put everything on a few people, and don't grab things that are not the work of your own department. For example, the executive committee members of the student union not only divided the work organizationally, but also divided who represents the student union to participate in what meetings of the school. Because there are many meetings in school administration with student representatives participating, it is necessary to divide responsibilities. The Youth League General Branch Organizational Committee originally only had one person, collecting League fees, filling out forms, writing reports, and sending reports, all done by one person. Of course, work and study would conflict, and neither would be done well. But later, an organizational committee member was added, and three staff members were hired, some specifically responsible for contacting the Municipal Party Committee, some specifically responsible for collecting League fees, which saves time, does the work well, and does not hinder study.

    5. Determine working hours to prevent "mental busyness": This point is also quite important. For example, the working hours of the General Branch of the League are after lunch every day, and at other times, unless there are special circumstances, the work of the League is not done. This way, with fixed working hours, everyone's working mood is also stable. No longer thinking about work all day like before, and not focusing on listening to lectures in class. Achieve concentrating on work when working and focusing on studying when studying.

    However, after these problems are solved, the contradiction between work and study is only initially overcome, because the problem of reforming the education system still exists. Reforming the old education system cannot be solved overnight, it is a long-term and arduous task. As Vice Minister Qian Junrui of the Ministry of Education said at the Representative Conference of Educators: "The reform of the education system cannot be impatient, it must go through the continuous reform of education at all levels, and accumulate experience before there can be an overall reform..." Therefore, we cannot simply wait for the reform of the education system, but should gradually overcome the contradiction between work and study on the existing basis.

　　河北高中怎样解决团员干部工作与学习的矛盾？
    郑仕钧
    工作与学习矛盾在河北高中（即冀高）表现得最严重的时候，是在去年暑假以前。这个矛盾，主要是存在于学生会和青年团的干部们身上。如学生会的主席刘鹏志，当时兼青年团支部的副支书、助学金管理委员会的委员、中苏友协筹委会的副主任。除去这些工作（开会在内），并要经常参加学校行政的校务会议、教导会议。据当时统计，一个青年团的支委有时一周要开十二个半钟头的会。许多社团还要耽误正课来排剧、唱歌。有些活动分子都感到工作与学习有矛盾。
    这种矛盾的产生，一方面有其客观原因，如刚一解放，没有摸索到很好的工作方法，开会开不好，浪费许多时间，解决问题很少；一方面也存在着一些思想上的问题。最主要的是：以为文化学习不重要，学制不合理，老的一套完全要不得，等待着学制的改革，主观上把工作和学习对立起来。当时各部门的干部多是青年团员，但没有弄明确青年团在学校的任务是团结师生，搞好学习。以为青年团在学校的任务就是发动同学去开会，发展组织等，忽略了团的基本任务。
    当时同学们对青年团的反映是：青年团员不重视文化学习。因此许多人怕妨碍功课而不入团，这样也妨碍了团的发展。
    经过暑期学习，大家的政治水平、工作方法都提高了一步。青年团首先明确地提出团在学校的任务是团结师生，搞好学习。使大家主观上重视了学习，也主动地抓紧时间，分配时间。尤其在学校提出开展新民主主义学习以后，大家都了解了新民主主义的好学生要具备思想进步、学习积极、身体健康三个条件。大家都以这三个条件检查了自己，这样更重视了学习。这时，团也得到了很大的发展。大家都认识到只有团员和同学在一起搞好学习的时候，团才能得到正常的发展。
    在克服工作与学习矛盾这一问题上，我们有以下几点经验：
    一、解决思想问题：把等待学制改革、轻视文化课学习、主观上把工作与学习对立起来等错误思想加以批判。同时，因为学校干部多是青年团员，所以必须明确指出青年团在学校的基本任务是什么。这些思想上的问题如果得不到解决，工作与学习的矛盾是不能解决的。关于这个问题，要好好学习市工委关于解决工作与学习矛盾的报告和关于青年团在学校的任务的决定。
    二、避免兼职过多：这个现象，上学期在我校是很严重地存在着。一人身兼数职的现象很多。现在则不同了。这学期工作比上学期多了许多，增加了消费合作社、中苏友协等组织，青年团的组织也由一个支部扩大成了十二个分支，成立了总支，但参加工作的同学也大大增多了，现在全校参加大小工作的同学，约占总人数的百分之八十。如二丁一班四十五个人，除走读生四人，有病的三人，其余三十七人中有三十五人有工作。事情虽多，但大家分担，也就不会影响学习，并会把工作做得很好。
    三、精简会议：就是订出会议制度，不开没准备的会，费时间少，但能解决很多问题，如青年团总支部在从前开一个会至少要两小时；精简会议后，一般的会不超过一个钟头。总结一月工作时，在一周前就通知各部门早做准备，到会上很快就解决了问题。
    四、精细分工：不要什么事情都放在少数人身上，不是自己部门的工作不要乱抓。像学生会的执委，不但在组织上分了工，并且谁代表学生会参加学校的什么会，也都分开了。因为学校行政上有学生代表参加的会议很多，必须分工负责。青年团总支部组织委员原来只一个人，收团费、填表格、写汇报、送汇报，都是一个人，工作和学习当然要矛盾，且都搞不好。但后来增添了一名组织委员，又聘请了三个干事，有人专负责和市工委联系，有人专管收团费，这样既省时间，工作也作得好，又不妨碍学习。
    五、确定工作时间，防止“心忙”：这点也是相当重要的，譬如团总支部的工作时间是每日中午饭后，其它时间如无特殊情形，就不做团的工作，这样有了一定的工作时间，大家的工作情绪也安定下来了。不再像以前那样整天想工作，上课的时候也不安心听课。做到了工作时专心工作，学习时一心学习。
    但是，以上这些问题得到解决，工作与学习的矛盾只是初步克服，因为现在还存在着改革学制的问题。改革旧学制，不是一朝一夕能解决的，它是一个长期而艰巨的工作。正如教育部钱俊瑞副部长在教育工作者代表大会上所说：“改革学制不能性急，必须经过各级教育的不断改革，积累经验之后，才能有全盘的改革……”所以我们不能单纯等待学制改革，而应在现有基础上逐步克服工作与学习的矛盾。
