A Communist Party member, able to make his personal interests absolutely and unconditionally subordinate to the interests of the Party under any circumstances, is the standard for testing whether this member is loyal to the Party, loyal to the revolution, and loyal to the cause of communism.
                            Liu Shaoqi: On the Self-Cultivation of a Communist Party Member

    On December 19, 1949, the young female Communist Party member Zhao Guilan created an extraordinary achievement.

    Zhao Guilan is a female chemical configuration worker at the Dalian Jianxin Factory, and is twenty years old this year. She has been working with extraordinary enthusiasm since she entered the factory two years ago. In December of last year, Zhao Guilan often felt dizzy and weak due to menstrual problems. The factory and her co-workers advised her to rest for a few days, but she thought that if she rested, no one would replace her work, so she insisted on working as usual.

    On December 19 of last year, the whistle for the end of work had already sounded, and Zhao Guilan took a package of "fulminate of mercury" wrapped in cotton paper from a workshop, preparing to send it to the configuration room. When she was twenty steps away from the configuration room, she suddenly felt dizzy, the buildings spun before her eyes, the ground moved, her legs trembled, and her body swayed. She thought, this is not good, the "fulminate of mercury" in her hand is used for configuring mining explosives, and it will explode if it touches the ground. But at this moment, she could no longer hold on and fell to the ground with a thud. She knew that the "fulminate of mercury" would explode in less than a minute if it touched the ground. She thought about throwing the "fulminate of mercury" away. But she also thought about the many machines and raw materials in the factory. It would be better to throw the "fulminate of mercury" in an open space, otherwise the factory would suffer a great loss. "No!" She closed her eyes tightly, gritted her teeth, and held the "fulminate of mercury" tightly. At that moment, with a "boom," the glass on the nearby doors and windows vibrated. The workers ran towards the sound in panic, and from afar they saw a person lying down. When they ran closer, they recognized Zhao Guilan, a female worker lying near a crater looking like a bloody figure. Everyone screamed in different voices: "Oh, Zhao Guilan!" Someone found a large truck. Someone else found a large cotton quilt, and everyone carefully lifted her onto the truck. Just as the car was about to start, her brother rushed over with a pale face, jumped into the car, and carefully held her. At the hospital, she was immediately carried into the operating room. At this time, Comrade Qian, the deputy secretary of the general Party branch of the factory, also rushed over. In the operating room, her brother clearly saw that his sister's upper lip was split, her forehead and cheeks were injured by the explosion, and her right arm from her hand to her elbow was missing half of its flesh, five tendons were broken, and it was bloody as if it had just been fished out of a blood basin. When her brother saw her left arm and forearm being sawed off and thrown into a large magnetic basin, his heart ached, and he couldn't help but sob quietly. Zhao Guilan slowly woke up from her coma and unconsciously groaned "It hurts!" After a while, she seemed to hear her brother's crying and said in a low voice, "Brother, don't be sad, I don't hurt anymore." In fact, at this time, the anesthetic had worn off, and it was the most painful time. Everyone around her felt a pang in their noses when she said that. After a tense operation, everyone stared at the doctor's face, hoping that the doctor would say that Zhao Guilan's life could be saved... but the doctor silently shook his head.

    On the fourth day after the operation, when the pain had slightly lessened, Zhao Guilan noticed that her left arm felt light. While her brother was out, she used her legs to lift half of the quilt, and her eyes strained to look down, her left hand was gone! She felt a pang of sadness, and tears streamed down her face like broken beads. In the past four days, she had not shed a tear for the pain. When changing the dressing, cold sweat poured down from the pain, and she even fainted from the pain. She always clenched her teeth and never cried out in pain. She endured all the most unspeakable pain because she was afraid that her cries would make others uncomfortable. But now she thought that she was disabled and could no longer work, and she cried sadly. Her brother came in and was stunned, and hurriedly asked, "What's wrong, sister?" She didn't say a word, her eyes filled with tears as she looked at her brother. After a while, she said heavily, "Brother, my hand is gone!" When her brother heard this, he felt like his heart was being twisted, and he almost cried too. He tried his best to suppress himself, trying to find a word to comfort her, but he couldn't find one. He suddenly remembered what Comrade Qian, the deputy secretary of the general branch, had told him, and hurried out to call and invite Comrade Qian over. Zhao Guilan said to Comrade Qian in a heavy voice, "My cultural level is too low, and I won't be able to do more work for the Party in the future." Comrade Qian warmly comforted her and told her many heroic stories of Communist Party members. Comrade Qian was also afraid that she would not be able to think straight, and finally sincerely told her: "Comrade Zhao Guilan, just take good care of your injuries! In the future, the Party will help you improve your education, take care of your work, and will also be responsible for taking care of your personal life." Zhao Guilan was very grateful and smiled forcefully!

    In the past few days, the Party branch secretary, ministers, factory director, and workers have all come to visit and comfort her. The Party's care for her is so thoughtful, taking care of everything from food, clothing, and housing. The nurses also took care of her enthusiastically, and even read her stories of Party members from the Northeast Daily. Zhao Guilan felt that the Party was like her kind mother, giving her infinite love and comfort, and a new force was injected into her body.

    What force drives a twenty-year-old girl to create such an extraordinary deed?

    Zhao Guilan came from a poor family and had endured the hardships of life. Her parents had passed away long ago, and she only had two older brothers and a sister-in-law. Her eldest brother went to work at the Jianxin Factory in 1947, and her second brother served as a people's police officer. At this time, the salaries of her two brothers were enough to support the whole family, and they no longer had to beg for food and suffer like before liberation. But she did not want to be idle at home and be supported by others. In early 1948, she also went to work at the Jianxin Factory. Soon, the extraordinary enthusiasm of this girl attracted everyone's attention.

    One night, not long after she entered the factory, she and team leader Comrade Wang Peiying were on night shift together. In the middle of the night, the nitric acid in the room suddenly expanded the bottle opening and caught fire. She hurriedly woke up the team leader. The team leader told her to watch over it and hurried to call people to put it out. There was more and more smoke in the room. At this time, she remembered what others had said, that opening the windows would stop the smoke. She didn't hesitate and rushed in, desperately holding her breath, fumbling to open the windows. By the time the team leader brought people over, the nitric acid had burned through her pants and shoes, and she was very badly smoked. Others praised her in surprise, but she smiled as if nothing had happened. Later, she was assigned to the chemical configuration room to learn techniques. Others were reluctant to do this work because it was dangerous, but she said: "You can't make a revolution if you are afraid of difficulties!" During the learning period, her master still had some conservative ideas and was reluctant to teach apprentices, but she came up with a way to overcome this difficulty: she worked hard to improve her education, learned to write whenever she had time, carefully memorized the names of various chemical drugs, and paid attention to how the master configured them. Whenever she saw that the master was happy, she would ask more questions. Her efforts were not in vain, and soon she was able to write the names and amounts of chemical drugs on a list and paste it on the wall, slowly figuring out the tricks of configuration work.

    When the Party discovered that Zhao Guilan had the excellent qualities of the working class, it began to cultivate and educate her. In December 1948, she gloriously joined the Communist Party. Under the education of the Party, she became stronger and more diligent. She not only worked hard herself, but also helped others to progress at all times. Her brother gradually progressed and joined the Party with her help and promotion. Even during this recovery period, when she learned that she could still work, she happily looked forward to returning to study and work after being discharged from the hospital. She knew that those who went to see her would be saddened by her injuries and the painful disabled life that followed. Therefore, no matter who went, she never mentioned her pain, but instead asked others how their work and studies were going with great concern, chatting and laughing like usual. This enabled everyone who went to see her to gain infinite inspiration and encouragement from her. (Attached picture)

　　共产党的好女儿——赵桂兰
    雷风
    一个共产党员，能够使他个人的利益不论在任何情况下都能绝对地无条件地服从党的利益，是考验这个党员是否忠于党、忠于革命与共产主义事业的标准。
                            刘少奇：论共产党员的修养
    一九四九年十二月十九日，年青的女共产党员赵桂兰创造了不平凡的事迹。
    赵桂兰是大连建新工厂的化学配置女工，今年二十岁。她进厂两年来，一直以非凡的热情工作着。去年十二月间，赵桂兰因为月经病常感头昏，全身发软没劲。厂方和工友们都劝她休息几天，但她想休息了工作没人代替，便照常坚持工作。
    去年十二月十九日，放工的汽笛声已经响了，赵桂兰从一个工作室里拿了一包用棉纸包的“雷汞”，准备送到配置室去。当她走到离配置室还有二十步远的地方，突然头昏了，房子在眼前直转，地也动，两腿直打颤，身子乱幌。她一想不好，手里拿的“雷汞”是配置开矿山用的，一触地就要爆炸。可是就在这时，她已经坚持不住，扑通一声跌倒了。她知道“雷汞”触地了用不上一分钟就要爆炸。她想把“雷汞”扔出去。可是她又想到工厂里摆着那么多机器、原料，要是把“雷汞”扔在空地上还好，否则工厂就要遭受很大损失。“不能！”她紧闭着眼、咬着牙，握紧了“雷汞”。就在这一刹那，“轰”的一声，附近门窗上的玻璃都被振动响了。工友们都惊慌地朝着响声的地方跑来，老远就看见一个人在躺着。跑近一看，一个女工像血人一样躺在一个被炸的坑边。从那血迹模糊的脸上认出是赵桂兰，大家不同的声音尖叫着：“呀，赵桂兰！”有人把大卡车找来了。又有人找来了一床大棉被，大家小心地把她抬上车。车刚要开，她哥哥苍白着面色赶来了，跳上车去小心翼翼地抱着她。到医院马上抬进手术室，这时工厂的中共总支部副书记钱同志也赶来了。在手术室，她哥哥才清楚地看出他妹妹上嘴唇裂开，前额、两颊炸伤，右臂从手到肘少了半边肉，断了五根筋，血淋淋地像从血盆里刚捞上来的。当她哥哥看到她的左臂、前肢被锯下扔在大磁盆里时，心里一酸，忍不住低低地哽咽起来。赵桂兰从昏厥中慢慢苏醒过来，不自觉地哼了一声“痛啊”！过了一会，她好像听见了哥哥的哭泣声，就低声说：“哥哥，你不要难过，我不痛了。”其实，这时麻药过劲，正是疼得厉害的时候。周围的人叫她这么一说，鼻子都酸了。一阵紧张的手术过后，大家盯着医生的脸，盼望医生说一句赵桂兰的性命能保得住……医生却默默的摇头。
    动手术后第四天，伤痛稍稍减轻了，赵桂兰发觉左胳膊有些飘轻。趁着哥哥出去的工夫，她用腿把被子撩起一半，眼睛用力向下一看，左手没有了！她一阵心酸，眼泪像断线的串珠一样直往下淌。四天来，她没有为伤痛流过一滴眼泪，换药时痛的冷汗直流，甚至痛的昏死过去，她总是紧咬牙关，从不喊叫一声痛。她忍受着一切最难言的伤痛，是怕她叫喊了使别人难受。可是现在她想到自己残废了，再不能工作了，她伤心地哭起来了。她哥哥进来一看愣着了，急忙问：“妹妹怎么了？”她没有出声，两眼水汪汪地瞅着她哥哥。一会儿，她沉重地说：“哥哥，手没有了”！她哥哥一听，心里像一阵刀绞，差一点也哭出来。他竭力压制着自己，想找句话安慰她，但却一句也找不着。他忽然想起总支副书记钱同志告诉他的话，赶忙出去打电话，把钱同志请来。赵桂兰沉痛地对钱同志说：“我文化太低，往后再不能为党多做工作了”。钱同志热情地安慰她，给她讲了许多共产党员的英勇故事。钱同志还怕她想不开，最后又诚恳地告诉她：“赵桂兰同志，你只管好好养伤吧！将来党会帮助你提高文化，照顾你的工作，而且也能负责照顾你的私生活。”赵桂兰心里非常感激，用力地笑了！
    几天来党的支书和部长、厂长、工友都不断地来看望她安慰她。党对她的照顾真周到，吃、穿、住没有一样不想到。护士们也热情地照看她，还给她念东北日报上的党员的故事。赵桂兰感到党像自己的慈母，给自己以无限的爱抚和安慰，她身上便注入了一股新的力量。
    什么力量驱使一个二十岁的女孩子创造出这样不平凡的事迹呢？
    赵桂兰出身贫苦，经受过艰苦生活的磨练。她父母早已去世，只有两个哥哥和一个嫂子。她大哥一九四七年就到建新工厂做工，二哥担任人民警察的职务。这时她两个哥哥的薪水已经能养活全家，再不像解放前那样要饭受苦了。但她不愿在家闲着叫别人养活。一九四八年初她也到建新工厂里做工了。不久，这个女孩子的非凡的工作热情就引起了大家的注意。
    在进厂不久的一个晚上，她和组长王培英同志一起值夜班。半夜时，忽然屋里硝酸把瓶口涨开燃烧起来。她急忙叫醒组长。组长叫她看守着，自己赶忙去喊人来扑灭。屋里的烟越来越多。这时她记起了别人讲过，把窗户开开就不冒烟了。她没有半分迟疑，打开门冲进去，拚命闭着气，摸索着把窗子打开。待组长把人喊来时，硝酸已把她的裤子、鞋都烧破了，人也被熏得很厉害。别人惊奇地称赞她，她像没这回事一样笑着。后来她被分配到化学配置室去学技术。别人都因为这个工作危险不愿干，但她说：“怕困难就不能革命！”在学习期间，她的师傅思想上还有些保守思想不愿教徒弟，但她想出办法克服这个困难：她努力提高自己的文化，有空就学写字，用心记住各种化学药品名称，留心看师傅怎么配置，她什么时候瞅着师傅高兴了就多问问。工夫没有白费的，不久她就能把化学药品名称和分量写成单子贴在墙上，慢慢摸着配置工作的门路了。
    党发现了在赵桂兰身上具有着工人阶级的优秀品质时，就开始培养教育她。一九四八年十二月她光荣地参加了共产党。在党的教育下，她变得更坚强勤奋。她不但自己努力，并且时时帮助别人进步。她哥哥就是在她的帮助推动下逐渐进步，参加了党。就是在这次养伤中，当她知道了她还能工作时，她就愉快地盼望着出院后重新学习、工作。她知道去看她的人，都会为她的伤痛和以后痛苦的残废生活而难过的。因此，无论谁去，她对自己的伤痛总是一字不提，相反，很关心地问别人工作怎样，学习怎样，像平常一样谈笑着。这使每一个去看她的人，都能从她身上得到无限的振奋和鼓舞。（附图片）
