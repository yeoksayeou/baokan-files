　　Workers Across Regions Respond to Metallurgical Workers' Wage Increase Demands
    French Strike Movement Expands
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 1st, the strike movement initiated by metallurgical and metal industry workers in the Paris region to demand wage increases is now spreading throughout France. In the Seine and Oise departments alone, 180,000 workers have participated in the strike, and approximately 215 enterprises have completely shut down. Workers in 28 steel enterprises, iron and metal workers in Lyon, 17 metallurgical and machinery enterprises in the Nord department, and 20 enterprises in Marseille have also gone on strike. According to *Ce Soir*, 70% to 90% of metallurgical and metal industry workers in the Nord, Doubs, Rhône, and Marseille departments have resolved to support the strike.
    The strike movement is extending beyond the metal industry to other industrial sectors. For example, construction workers engaged in the "Ten Great Projects" in Paris have also gone on strike. The strike is also gaining traction among insurance company employees, chemical industry workers, and Paris Metro and bus workers.
    The strike situation has caused great consternation among the government and employers, who are devising methods of suppression. The government has already dispatched police and the "Republican Security Companies" to provoke striking workers, and even to occupy striking enterprises.

　　各地工人响应冶金工人增资要求
    法罢工运动扩展
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社巴黎一日讯：巴黎区冶金与金属工业工人为要求增加工资而发动的罢工运动，现正扩展至法国全国各地。仅在塞纳和瓦斯两省，就有十八万工人参加了罢工，约有二百十五个企业现已完全停歇。里昂二十八的钢家企业铁和金属工人、诺尔省十七家冶金和机器企业以及马赛二十家企业的工人，也都举行罢工。据《今晚报》称，诺尔省、杜省、罗尼省以及马赛的冶金与金属工业的工人，已有百分之七十至九十决议赞成罢工。
    罢工运动正扩及金属工业以外的其他工业部门。例如，从事于巴黎十大计划工作的建筑工人也罢工了。罢工在保险公司职员、化学工业工人以及巴黎地下电车和公共汽车工人中间也有进展。
    罢工的情势已使政府与雇主十分惶恐，他们正在拟订镇压的办法。政府现已出动警察与“共和国保安队”，向罢工工人寻衅，甚至进占各罢工的企业。
