Humanity Always Exists in the Hearts of the People
    Soviet Peace Committee Delegation Head Fadeyev
    Speech at the Stockholm Peace Congress on March 18

    Dear friends! I take this opportunity to convey the warm greetings of the Soviet Peace Committee to the progressive intellectuals and all honest people of Sweden who advocate peace.

    I first salute the millions of ordinary people of Sweden, for they are the mainstay of peace.

    It is their labor, the labor of the common people, that lays the foundation for all true culture. It is they, the common people, who first maintain the best national traditions and national independence. And they are now the true advocates of humanity, because most of the privileged people of our time have abandoned humanity, while humanity always exists in the hearts of the people, just as sparks exist in flint.

    In some cases, this spark bursts forth very powerfully. There are many reasons to believe that we are living in such an era.

    The insatiable groups in Europe and America, incited by the most powerful and inhumane among them, are quite openly preparing to improve their affairs with a new war. These privileged groups, instead of improving the living conditions of the people, are engaged in an unprecedented arms race, including the competition to produce weapons that threaten to obliterate millions of women and children, entire cities, and all of civilization. Over-inflated military spending brings taxes, high prices, and meager wages—a heavy burden on the shoulders of the people of large and small countries.

    Newspapers, radio, and movies in the hands of the greedy are not used for education, to instill lofty ideals of humanism and friendship among nations large and small based on respect for national cultures, but instead threaten all nations with war; extol the large-scale destruction of people with atomic and hydrogen bombs; promote racial and national hatred, or nationalistic anarchism, while outwardly flaunting many fashionable banners, such as the United States of Europe, world government, and other forms that allow strong countries to enslave weak countries; elevate gangsters, plunderers, murderers, and immoral people to the skies, in order to develop the despicable instincts needed for predatory wars.

    Turning through all of history, there has never been a period that, like now, so urgently needs the unity of the noble spiritual strength of ordinary people in all countries, of all progressive and honest people in the world, to oppose these decadent, misanthropic forces of war.

    I am very happy to represent one of the strongest and most reliable forces for peace, the great Soviet people and their artists, among the peace fighters.

    Indeed, there are many newspapers, said to be even here in Sweden, that insist that the United States and the Marshall Plan countries of Europe are forced to arm themselves because they are threatened with aggression from the Soviet Union. It is said that even peace-loving Sweden is threatened by this. If I may say so without being rude: “Enough lying, gentlemen! Your propaganda is more vicious than clever: it is prepared for those inexperienced people who don’t understand anything.”

    From the moment the new Russia was born in October 1917, the word peace was written on its banner. In the entire history of the new Russia, what we have hoped for and what we still hope for is nothing but peace. Our people, from the first day of our founding until recent years, have been the object of aggression, but this is not our fault. We have been subjected to aggression by the combined forces of capitalist countries, by individual capitalist countries or their groups, by open aggression and disguised aggression in the form of provocation and subversion within our country.

    We have been forced to defend ourselves. The whole world knows that we are foolproof in defending ourselves. The whole world knows that we have not only defended our own freedom and independence, but also helped many European countries expel their invaders in World War II. Our country suffered greatly from the devastation of war, with heavy losses. But we have raised the level of our economy and culture through peaceful labor, making it surpass the pre-war level. Now, those who do not believe in our sincere loyalty to peace can also understand, according to common sense, that fighting is not good for us. Our lives are better than before. Since 1947, the prices of food and other goods have fallen three times and will continue to decrease in the future. The reactionary newspapers of various countries deliberately remain silent about this fact, lest the general public believe that the cost of living in the Soviet Union is decreasing day by day while the cost of living in Marshallized countries is increasing day by day. We have implemented a seven-year education system in order to nurture the next generation.

    In 1949, a total of 36 million children were enrolled in schools in our country. In short, we have sufficient grounds to look forward to the future with confidence. Only those forces that have no future try to provoke war. Because they cannot develop on the basis of peaceful competition, they hope to improve their unfortunate situation through aggression.

    If the Soviet Union itself is a multinational country, uniting about sixty large and small nationalities, how can the Soviet Union threaten other nationalities and countries? If the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were not built on the basis of equality and mutual respect among large and small nationalities, it would have fallen apart long ago. The strength of Soviet international policy stems precisely from the fact that this policy is based on respect for the national independence and national culture of every country, large or small.

    The Soviet people never force others to adopt their way of life and their way of thinking.

    However, the Soviet people will never allow others to put them in the position that the people of many European countries are now in, that is, to impose the so-called "American way of life" or "American way of thinking" on them.

    Historical experience shows that it is impossible to force the people of other countries to accept anything unless they are willing to accept it from their own experience. People will never accept things that are incompatible with them, and those who force them to accept these things will be punished sooner or later.

    When it comes to peace, we are willing and indeed are cooperating with those people who disagree with our way of thinking but sincerely advocate peace, respect the national honor and independence of their countries, and are not prepared to sell it for American scraps.

    We have already entered a period in which the unity of all honest people who defend peace is truly capable of defending peace. The people of all countries have good memories. Even the kindest people can be terrible if they are provoked. The people of all countries will respond to attempts to launch new wars by severely punishing the warmongers. Let the warmongers remember this. For peace, we cheer for the friendship of all nations! Long live world peace!

### 人道始终存在人民心坎中  苏联拥护和平委员会代表团团长法捷耶夫  三月十八日在斯德哥尔摩拥护和平群众大会上的演说

　　人道始终存在人民心坎中
    苏联拥护和平委员会代表团团长法捷耶夫
    三月十八日在斯德哥尔摩拥护和平群众大会上的演说
    亲爱的朋友们！我利用这个机会，向瑞典拥护和平的进步知识分子和一切正直的人民转达苏联拥护和平委员会的热烈敬意。
    我首先向瑞典的千百万老百姓致敬，因为他们正是和平的中流砥柱。
    是他们的劳动，老百姓的劳动，奠下了一切真正的文化基础。是他们，老百姓，首先保持最优良的民族传统与民族独立。而且他们现在是真正人道的拥护者，因为我们这个时代大部分的特权人物已弃绝人道，而人道却始终存在于人民心坎中，正如火花存在于火石中一样。
    在某些情况下，这火花便非常有力地迸发出来。有许多理由足以使人相信我们正生活在这样的时代里。
    欧美那些贪得无厌的集团被这些集团中最强大最不人道的家伙所鼓动，正在十分公开地准备以新战争来改进他们的事务。这些特权集团不去改进人民的生活条件，却从事于史无前例的军备竞赛，就如威胁着要夷灭千百万妇孺、整批城市和全部文明的这一类武器，也在竞制之列。过分膨胀的军费，招来了赋税、高昂的物价和低微的薪资——大国和小国老百姓肩膊上的重担。
    掌握在贪婪者手里的报纸、无线电和电影，不是用来进行教育，将人道主义的崇高理想，和各大小民族间基于尊重民族文化之友谊的崇高理想，输到人们的心里，反而以战争威胁着所有各民族；颂扬以原子弹和氢弹来大规模毁灭人民；宣扬种族和民族的仇恨，或民族主义的无政府主义，外面却标榜着许多时髦的旗帜，什么欧洲合众国，世界政府，以及其他一些让强国奴化弱国的形式；将一些匪帮、掠夺者、杀人犯和那些无道德的人捧上天去，以发展那种为掠夺性战争所需要的卑鄙本能。
    翻遍全部历史，从来不曾有一个时期，像现在这样需要团结所有国家普通人民的、全世界一切进步与正直人民的崇高的精神力量，来反对这些腐朽的、憎恶人类的战争势力。
    我很高兴在和平斗士之中代表最强大最可靠的和平力量之一——伟大的苏维埃人民和他们的艺术家。
    诚然，有许多报纸，据说甚至在瑞典这儿也有，硬说美国和欧洲马歇尔计划国家都是由于受到来自苏联方面的侵略威胁而被迫武装的。据说甚至爱好和平的瑞典都受到这种威胁。假若不粗暴的话，我要这样说：“撒谎够了吧，绅士们！你们的宣传是恶毒胜于聪明了：它是准备给那些不懂什么的毫无经验的人听的。”
    从新俄罗斯在一九一七年十月诞生的那一刻起，在它的旗帜上就写下了和平的字。在新俄罗斯的全部历史中，我们所曾祈望而且我们现在仍在祈望的，没有别的，只是和平。我国人民自从我们立国的第一天起，到近数年以来，一直是侵略的对象，但这并不是我们的过错。我们曾受到资本主义国家的联合力量的侵略，受到个别资本主义国家或其集团的侵略，受到公开的侵略及伪装的在我国内进行挑拨及颠覆活动的侵略。
    我们曾被迫保卫我们自己。全世界都知道我们在保卫自己方面是万无一失的。全世界都知道我们不仅保卫了我们自己的自由与独立，而且曾在第二次世界大战中，帮助许多欧洲国家逐出他们的侵略者，我国饱受战争的破坏，损失重大。但是我们以和平的劳动又提高了我国的经济与文化的水平，使之超过战前的水平。现在，那些不相信我们真心忠诚于和平的人们，根据常识也可以明白：打仗对我们是没有好处的。我们的生活较前更为美好。自从一九四七年以来，食品及其他货物的价格已下跌三次，以后还要继续减低。各国反动报纸对这件事实故意表示缄默，免得一般普通人民相信苏联的生活费用日益降低而马歇尔化各国的生活费用却是与日俱增。我们为了培育下一代，已经实行了七年制教育。
    一九四九年，我国共有三千六百万儿童入学。总之，我们有充分根据，满怀信心地瞻望未来。只有那种没有前途的力量才力图挑起战争。因为它们不能在和平竞赛的基础上发展，所以希望用侵略来改善他们的倒霉境况。
    如果苏联本身就是个多民族的，团结着约六十个大小民族的国家，那未苏联怎么会威胁其他民族和国家呢？如果苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟不是建筑在大小民族平等和互相尊重的基础上，那么它早就四分五裂了。苏联国际政策的力量就正是导源于这一事实，即是这个政策是以尊重每个大小国家的民族独立和民族文化为基础的。
    苏联人民决不强迫他人采取他们的生活方式和他们的思想方法。
    但是，苏联人民将永远不容许他人把他们置于欧洲许多国家的人民现在所处的地位，即是说，把所谓“美国生活方式”或“美国的思想方法”强施于他们头上。
    历史的经验表明，是不能强迫其他国家的人民接受任何东西的，除非他们从自己的经验中已经愿意接受它。人民将永远不会接受与他们不相合的东西，并且强迫他们接受这些东西的人们早晚会受到惩处。
    谈到和平，我们是愿意而且的确正在和这样的人们合作：他们不同意我们的思想方法，但却真诚地拥护和平，尊重他们国家的民族荣誉和独立，并且不准备出卖它来换取美国的残羹剩饭。
    我们业已进入这样的时期——即一切捍卫和平的正直的人们的团结，真正是能够保卫住和平。各国人民都有很好的记忆力。即使是最善良的人们也会是可怕的，假如他们被激怒了的话。各国人民是会用严惩战争贩子的办法来回答发动新战争的企图的。让战争贩子们记住这一点吧。为了和平，我们欢呼各民族的友谊！全世界和平万岁！
