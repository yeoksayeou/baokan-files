　　Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng's Mistakes in Violating Human Rights
　　By our reporter Shang Kai
　　Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng, the deputy director and Communist Party members of the Second Electrical Machinery Repair Factory under the Telecommunications Bureau of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, recently mistakenly believed that workers had stolen property, arbitrarily searched their persons, and illegally detained workers, committing a serious error of violating human rights.
　　The course of events is as follows:
　　From December 31st of last year to January 21st of this year, theft incidents occurred continuously at the Second Electrical Machinery Repair Factory. A total of nineteen employees lived in the factory, including Gao Zhaoqing's younger brother, Gao Zhaoming. Gao Zhaoming is eleven years old and recently came to Beijing from Shanghai to attend school. He has strong petty hooligan habits.
　　After the first and second incidents of money loss, Cui Daosheng and Gao Zhaoqing subjectively concluded that the thefts were committed by the workers living in the factory. On January 15th, worker Duan Lianjie lost 270,000 yuan again. Cui Daosheng and Gao Zhaoqing then arbitrarily conducted a large-scale search of the dormitory. They then discovered that Dai Pinzhen, a worker living in the factory, had remitted 70,000 yuan to his family, and they suspected him of theft. However, after repeated inquiries, there were no clues. Cui Daosheng and Gao Zhaoqing then said to Dai Pinzhen: "You are not allowed to leave the factory until this matter is clarified." Dai Pinzhen was detained in this way. At this time, some workers were already discussing: "Gao Zhaoming has been eating and drinking extravagantly and spending money recklessly recently, and his behavior is suspicious." However, Gao Zhaoqing neither conducted in-depth investigations among the masses nor paid attention to or was wary of his hooligan brother. Up until January 21st (Sunday), after worker Xu Mingbi suffered another loss of money, someone directly suggested to Cui Daosheng and Gao Zhaoqing that Gao Zhaoming's behavior was suspicious. Cui and Gao did not pay attention to the opinions of the masses, and once again mistakenly ordered Zhuang Ruihuan, the deputy captain of the security team, to search Ma Jilong, the cook, and Old Woman Wu, the laundry worker, who were in the factory at the time. Gao Zhaoming was also in the factory at the time, but they believed that an eleven-year-old child would not do such a thing, and did not pay attention to him. The search was ineffective, and Gao Zhaoqing began to accept the suggestion of Jian Youru, the branch secretary, and questioned Gao Zhaoming based on the clues provided by the workers. Gao Zhaoming initially quibbled, but finally admitted that he alone had committed the thefts several times because of the overwhelming evidence.
　　On January 28th, a general meeting of all employees was held. When Cui Daosheng reported the process of solving the case and stated that the losses of the victims would be compensated, he had not yet realized the seriousness of the mistake of detaining Dai Pinzhen and searching the workers. When announcing the lifting of Dai Pinzhen's detention, he only said "this was due to a misunderstanding." He neither reviewed his mistakes nor apologized to the wronged workers. As a result, the workers were dissatisfied on the spot. During the group discussions, the atmosphere was already seething with different opinions. Some criticized Cui Daosheng and Gao Zhaoqing for being "too subjective and not trusting the masses," and "not trusting the cadres from the new area." Some proposed: "The factory management committee is not democratic and must be re-elected." Others proposed: "Privately detaining workers violates Article 5 of the Common Program and should be dismissed and investigated." Because the search of the person and detention of workers were not approved by the trade union, the trade union was also accused by the workers of "not protecting human rights," saying that "the trade union is following the administration's lead." Individual bad elements took the opportunity to scold and sabotage, plotting revenge. In this situation, some trade union cadres, in order to restore the trade union's prestige among the masses, also clamored along with the masses and opposed the administration instead of helping to solve the problem, believing that this would keep them from being detached from the masses. Therefore, the confusion was further fueled.
　　On January 31st, at the request of the workers, a general meeting of all employees was held again, which collected and passed the opinions of each group, requesting the trade union to submit the written opinions to the People's Court and the higher-level authorities. The matter continued to expand, and production efficiency declined accordingly. After receiving the branch report, the general branch consulted the municipal party committee and convened a general branch committee meeting. Responsible persons from all relevant parties were invited to participate in the discussion to determine the principle of "distinguishing responsibilities, clarifying right and wrong, respecting the opinions of the masses, and striving to adopt mediation methods." A working group composed of representatives from the party, government, and trade union was sent to the factory to investigate and resolve the issue. After the working group arrived at the factory and initially understood the situation, they apologized and consoled the wronged workers, and individually talked to the workers to explain the situation and solicit opinions on solutions. On the other hand, they convened a meeting of party members and trade union group leaders, calling on everyone to go deep into the masses to solicit their opinions. Initially, the masses were concerned about whether the higher authorities would favor the old cadres. After the explanation, the masses' concerns were dispelled. They then raised questions such as "Is violating human rights a violation of the law?" and "Should those who violate the law be sent to court?" At that time, the working group put forward two options: one was to send them to court and handle them according to legal procedures; the other was to resolve the issue through self-adjustment and settlement, and to give the leaders appropriate punishment based on the opinions and suggestions of the masses. After careful consideration, the workers unanimously agreed to the second option. As one worker said: "Originally, we didn't have much opinion, it's just that the deputy director didn't believe us and didn't admit his mistakes, so we got angry and started fighting him. Speaking of it, this is still our own family's affair and should be resolved by ourselves." Dai Pinzhen also said: "I have no opinion, I only ask them to make a good review." But then the fear of the factory director's retaliation affecting his job came again, and he asked for a written guarantee. The working group then explained separately: explaining that today's regime is the people's regime, and everyone should trust the government, trust the higher authorities, and also believe in their own strength. The mood of the masses gradually stabilized. On February 3rd, a general meeting of all employees was held. Zhang Jirong, the secretary of the general branch, first apologized to the wronged workers, then strictly criticized Cui Daosheng and Gao Zhaoqing for making a principled mistake of violating human rights, and pointed out that this was the result of subjectivism, not trusting the masses, and handling problems solely based on one's own narrow experience. This is not allowed by the Party and the administration. He also asked everyone to propose opinions on punishment. Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng also accepted the criticism from the higher authorities and the masses. After several days of deep reflection, they fully realized the seriousness of the mistake and the root causes of the mistake. Gao Zhaoqing apologized to the wronged workers at the meeting and reviewed himself, saying: "I have violated government laws and regulations and organizational discipline, and the Party's policies, causing losses to the Party and production. In the future, I will definitely accept everyone's opinions, accept the Party's education, and I am more willing to accept all aspects of my punishment." Cui Daosheng also similarly apologized to the wronged workers and reviewed his subjectivism, using his own brain to replace policies, and his unorganized and undisciplined mistakes such as not asking for instructions and not reporting. He said: "I will definitely study hard in the future and guarantee that I will not make similar mistakes again." And asked the higher authorities to give him punishment. At this time, the workers all said: "The Communist Party really knows its mistakes and admits them." Some people were moved to tears on the spot and said: "The higher authorities have come to apologize, what else do we want?" During group discussions, when soliciting opinions on handling the matter, the mood of the masses had turned to calm and peaceful. Worker Cheng He said: "Our own family should handle its own affairs. They have already admitted their mistakes, why bother to punish them again?" Others said: "It shouldn't have been made so big." When the comprehensive group compiled the opinions on the punishment, some advocated recording a demerit or criticism, and some advocated not even giving criticism. Based on the opinions of the masses, the leaders announced on the spot that the lost property would be compensated by Gao Zhaoqing at the actual price, and Gao Zhaoming would be immediately removed from the factory. In order to better warn the individuals involved and educate the masses, in addition to the Telecommunications Bureau deciding to give Gao Zhaoqing a demerit and Cui Daosheng a warning, and the Beijing Telecommunications Trade Union giving Gao Zhaoqing a warning and Cui Daosheng a criticism, the Party also decided to convene a branch meeting to give them criticism.
　　In this incident, the Communist Party branch of the factory fully demonstrated its weakness and incompetence. The bi-monthly branch meeting had become a formality, lacking political and ideological education. There had never been criticism and self-criticism within the Party, discipline was lax, and organizational life was unsound. Jian Youru, the branch secretary, lacked strong principles and developed a dependency on Cui and Gao. The branch had never held a meeting to study and arrange necessary work within the Party after the continuous theft incidents in the factory. Therefore, party members with poor organization, such as Cui and Gao, often handled things on their own without reporting to the branch. The detention of Dai Pinzhen was never reported to the branch. It was not until after the case was solved that the branch secretary knew about this when the workers raised their opinions at the general meeting. However, he still did not know to convene a branch meeting to study solutions, but passively reported to the general branch (the general branch was not in the factory). But the masses still loved the Party. At the mass group meetings, everyone asked: "Why doesn't the branch come to solve the problem?" "Why doesn't the branch secretary come out to speak?" They criticized "Party members cannot play a core role." Some even mistakenly believed that if party members made mistakes, it meant that the Party was not good. Two workers who had applied to join the Party asked for their applications back, saying: "I will not join your No. 2 factory's Party." Greatly reducing the Party's prestige among the masses.
　　Finally, the reporter visited the Factory Branch Section of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau General Branch regarding the punishment of Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng. The summary of their responses is as follows: Based on the analysis of the situation, Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng made a serious mistake of violating human rights, which is not allowed inside or outside the Party. Therefore, after receiving the report, they immediately organized a working group to investigate and deal with it. According to the nature of the error, it should be resolved through legal procedures, but according to the spirit of the People's Justice, a mediation method can be adopted. If it cannot be resolved, it can be resolved through the court. The working group put forward two solutions. The factory workers saw that Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng had reflected on and recognized their mistakes, and agreed to resolve the issue through mediation. Of course, there is no need to go through legal procedures. In order to better warn and educate the individuals involved, the Party, based on the opinions of the masses, decided to convene a branch meeting to give them criticism, in addition to suggesting that the administration and the trade union also give them punishment.
　　The reporter also pointed out: Violating human rights is a principled mistake. If the Party only gives criticism to party members without giving appropriate punishment, it is inappropriate. The Factory Branch Section and the General Branch Committee have expressed that they can accept this opinion, and are prepared to raise this issue to the Party Committee for re-discussion and research.

　　高兆庆  崔道生  侵犯人权的错误
    本报记者  商恺
    中央邮电部电信总局，第二电机修配厂副厂长，共产党员高兆庆、崔道生，最近误认工人偷盗财物，擅自搜查人身，软禁工人，犯了侵犯人权的严重错误。
    事情的经过是这样的：
    去年十二月三十一日至今年一月二十一日，第二电机修配厂，连续发生盗窃事件。厂内共住有职工十九人，其中有高兆庆的弟弟高兆明。高兆明今年十一岁，从上海来京入学不久，带有浓厚的小流氓习气。
    第一二次丢款事件发生后，崔道生、高兆庆即主观地肯定为住厂工人所偷。一月十五日，工人段连杰又丢款二十七万元。崔道生、高兆庆即擅自对宿舍进行大搜查，接着发现住厂工人戴聘珍曾向家汇款七万元，便又认定他有偷盗嫌疑。但几经查问，毫无线索，崔道生和高兆庆便向戴聘珍说：“这事没调查清楚以前不许你出门。”戴聘珍就这样被拘禁起来。这时工人中已有人议论：“高兆明近来在外大吃大喝，胡乱花钱，行迹可疑。”但高兆庆既不在群众中深入调查，对流氓成性的弟弟又不予警惕和注意。及至一月二十一日（星期日）工人徐明碧又发生丢款事件后，便有人直接向崔道生、高兆庆提示：高兆明行迹可疑。崔、高二人却不重视群众意见，而再一次错误地令保卫队副队长庄瑞环搜查了当时在厂的厨师马吉隆，和洗衣工吴老太太。当时高兆明也在厂，但他们认为十一岁的孩子，不致干出这样的事情来，而未予注意。搜查无效，高兆庆始接受支部书记简友如的建议，根据工人所提线索追问高兆明。高兆明初尚狡辩，最后因事证俱在终于承认几次偷盗全是他一人所为。
    一月二十八日召开全体职工大会，崔道生报告破案经过声明赔偿失主损失时，还未认识到拘禁戴聘珍和搜查工友的错误的严重。宣布解除对戴聘珍的拘禁时，只说“这是出于误会”，对自己的错误既未作检讨，对受委屈的工友又未道歉。因之当场引起了工人的不满。小组讨论时，已是群情沸腾，意见纷纭。有的批评崔道生和高兆庆“太主观，不相信群众。”“不相信新区干部。”有的提出：“工管会不民主，必须改选。”还有的提出：“私行拘禁工人，是违背了共同纲领第五条，应当撤职查办。”由于搜查人身，拘禁工人没有通过工会，工会也被工人指责“不保障人权”，说“工会当了行政的尾巴”。个别不良分子则趁机谩骂破坏，图谋报复。在这种情况下，有的工会干部为着挽回工会在群众中的威信，也跟着群众吵吵嚷嚷，和行政上对立而不帮助解决问题，认为这样才不脱离群众。因此更助长了混乱。
    一月三十一日，在工人要求下又召开了全体职工大会，汇集并通过了各组意见，要求工会将意见书送交人民法院和上级机关。事情继续扩大，生产效率随之低落。总支接到支部报告后，请示过市委，即召开总支委员会。并请各有关方面负责人参加研讨，确定以“分清责任，辨明事非，尊重群众意见，争取采用调解方式”为原则，由党政工三方面组成工作组，赴该厂调查解决。工作组到厂初步了解情况之后，一方面向受屈的工友道歉慰问，和工友们个别谈话、解释，征求解决意见；一方面召开了党员大会和工会组长会，号召大家深入群众，征求群众意见，最初群众还顾虑上级是否会袒护老干部？经过解释后，群众顾虑打消了，接着提出了“侵犯人权，是否犯法？”“犯法是否应送法院？”等问题。当时工作组提出了两个方案：一个是送法院，按法律手续办理；一个是自己调处解决，根据群众意见建议领导给以适当处分。工友们经过慎重的考虑一致同意了第二个方案。诚如一个工人所说：“本来我们没太大意见，就是因为副厂长不相信我们，错了又不认错，气到火头，就给他干起来了。说起来这还是自己家的事，应当自己解决。”戴聘珍也说：“我没意见了，我只要求他们要很好地检讨。”但接着害怕厂长报复影响职业的顾虑又来了，并要求写保证书。工作组遂又分头解释：说明今天的政权是人民的政权，大家要相信政府，相信上级，也要相信自己的力量。群众情绪逐渐稳定。二月三日召开全体职工大会。总支书张季荣首先向受委屈的工友道歉，接着严格的批评崔道生和高兆庆犯了侵犯人权的原则性的错误，并指出，这是：主观主义，不相信群众，单凭自己狭隘的经验来处理问题的结果，这是党和行政所不能容许的。并请大家提出处分的意见。高兆庆、崔道生也接受了上级和群众的批评，经过几天来的深刻反省，已完全认识了错误的严重性和错误的根源。高兆庆曾在大会上向受屈的工友赔情道歉后又检讨自己说：“我违反了政府法令和组织纪律，和党的政策，使党和生产受到了损失。今后我一定接受大家的意见，接受党的教育，我更愿接受各方面对我的处分。”崔道生也同样的向受屈的工人道歉，并检讨自己的主观主义，用自己的脑子代替政策，和不请示不报告等无组织无纪律的错误。他表示：“今后一定好好学习，保证不再犯类似的错误。”并要求上级给以处分。这时工友们都说：“共产党真是知错认错。”有的人当场被感动的流下泪来说：“上级都来赔情道歉了，我们还要怎么样呢？”在分组讨论，征求处理意见时，群众情绪已转为缓和平静，工人程和说：“自家人自家处理，已经承认错误了，何必再处分？”也有的说：“不该闹这么大。”综合小组对处分的意见时，有的主张记过或批评，有的主张连批评也不要。领导上根据群众意见，当场宣布所失财物由高兆庆折实赔偿，高兆明立刻出厂。为了更好的警惕本人和教育群众，除电信总局决定给高兆庆以记过，给崔道生以警告处分，北京电信工会给高兆庆以警告，给崔道生以批评处分外，党亦决定召开支部大会给予批评。
    在这次事件中，该厂共产党支部，充分表现了软弱无能。半月一次的支部例会，变成了形式，缺乏政治和思想教育。党内从来没有过批评与自我批评，纪律松弛，组织生活不健全。支部书记简友如原则性不强，养成了对崔、高二人一种依赖思想。厂内盗窃事件连续发生，支部从未开会研究在党内布置必要的工作。因此组织性较差的党员如崔、高等遇事也就常常不报告支部而自行处理。拘禁戴聘珍一事，即从未向支部报告。直到破案后，召开大会时，工人纷纷提出意见，支部书记才知道有这么一回事。但仍然不知道召开支部会研究解决办法，只是消极的报告总支（总支不在本厂）。但群众仍是爱护党的，在群众小组会上，大家提出：“支部为什么不来解决？”“支部书记为什么不出来讲话？”批评“党员不能起核心作用”。甚至有的人错误地认为党员犯了错误就是党不好。有两个申请入党的工人又要回了自己的入党申请书，说：“我不参加你们二厂的党。”大大地降低了党在群众中的威信。
    最后，记者就处分高兆庆、崔道生一事，又走访了中共北京市委会组织部工厂支部科与北京电信局总支。综合其答复意见如下：根据情况的分析，高兆庆、崔道生是犯了侵犯人权的严重错误，这是党内外所不能容许的，所以接到报告后，便立刻组织工作组前往调查处理。按错误的性质应当经过法律手续解决，但根据人民司法的精神，可以采用调解方式，如不能解决时，可经法院解决。工作组提出两个解决方案，该厂群众看到高兆庆、崔道生已反省并认识了自己错误，同意调处解决。这当然就不必要经过法律手续了。为了更好警惕和教育本人，党即根据群众意见，除建议行政和工会均给以处分外，亦决定召开支部会给予批评。
    记者又提出：侵犯人权，是一种原则性的错误，党对党员如果只给以批评，而不给以适当的处分，是不妥当的。对这一意见工支科与总支委会，已表示可以接受，并准备将这个问题提到党委会重新讨论研究。
