Robber Ren Junming and Three Others Executed
[This Newspaper reported] According to news from the Beijing News Office: The Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission, in response to the demands of the broad masses, announced at mass meetings in the southern suburbs, Changxindian, Mentougou, and Fengtai on the 23rd and 24th respectively, that special agents, traitors, and murderers Fan Xihua, Qiao Wenrui, Fu Junzan, Jia Ruxin, Mi Zhenhua, Zhang Hongshun, Zhang Gui, and Su Quanyi were sentenced to death and executed on the spot. Accomplice Zhao Zhiling was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.

Traitors, special agents, and murderers Fan Xihua, Qiao Wenrui, Fu Junzan, Jia Ruxin, Mi Zhenhua, Zhang Hongshun, and Zhang Gui all served in puppet positions under the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang bandit gangs. Relying on reactionary forces, they arrested and murdered our working cadres and innocent villagers, raped women, consistently opposed the people, committed numerous evils, and harmed the people's interests. Su Quanyi was a Kuomintang straggler who consistently oppressed the people. After liberation, this criminal, with his vicious nature, stabbed his divorced wife, who had remarried, to death with a knife, deliberately harming human rights and disrupting social order.

After the liberation of Beijing, victimized masses and families of the deceased from various places filed complaints with the Public Security Bureau. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the facts were verified, and the criminals were arrested and transferred to the Military Law Department of the Military Control Commission for trial. During the trial, except for Zhao Zhiling, an accomplice in the Zhang Hongshun case, who confessed, the others all downplayed their crimes, were extremely cunning, and showed no remorse.

On the 23rd and 24th, at mass meetings held in the southern suburbs, Changxindian, Mentougou, Fengtai, and other areas, many people, including Chen Zhongshi, the wife of the victim Zhang Ming, Wang Shuxue, Gao Ming, and Chen Dewang, accused Fan Xihua and other eight special agents and traitors of murder. The broad masses unanimously demanded that these special agents and traitors be shot to avenge the victims. The Military Law Department of the Military Control Commission accepted this just demand and sentenced Fan Xihua and other eight special agents and traitors to death according to law and executed them on the spot.

[Another News] The Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission, according to law, sentenced the ringleaders of continuous robberies, who killed and injured victims, Ren Junming, Cui Ruiqing, Wang Huiqing, and Xing Huarui, to death, and they were executed on the 24th. Accomplices in each case, Lü Ruihua, Han Hui, Liu Jinglian, Li Chunze, Xu Junde, and Cao Yuzhen, were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from three to fifteen years, with the aim of reforming them.

Ren Junming was originally a sergeant in the Kuomintang puppet tank regiment. Cui Ruiqing and Wang Huiqing were Kuomintang stragglers. After liberation, not only did they not repent, but they even organized armed robberies, carrying out several continuous robberies and shooting and injuring victims. Xing Huarui's life was consistently degenerate, and he colluded with Kuomintang stragglers to commit robberies. Under the pretext of hiring a cart, they robbed a cart and a mule, and to cover their tracks, they killed the cart owner with a sickle.

In order to consolidate revolutionary order and protect the safety of the people's lives and property, the Military Law Department of the Military Control Commission has sentenced the principal offenders in each case to death according to law. The accomplices were sentenced to imprisonment.
