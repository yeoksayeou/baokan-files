　　The North China Coal and Iron Company Shipped 270,000 Tons of Coal South Last Month, Ensuring Industrial Coal Supply for Shanghai and Other Cities

　　[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to greatly supply coal to urban and rural areas, the North China Coal and Iron Company shipped more than 270,000 tons of coal south in February. Considering that February was during the Spring Festival, the company, in order to seize the slack railway transportation season and achieve the goal of fully supplying coal to urban and rural areas, not only contacted the railway and mining sectors in advance to ensure the availability of wagons for loading but also made the necessary preparations itself. For example, checking internal procedures, discussing escort methods, etc. Many escorts made work plans, ensuring that they would not take holidays or return home during the Spring Festival (mainly the Guye escort team), and worked actively. The total monthly output was 97,000 tons of Kailuan coal, 57,000 tons of Yangquan coal, 38,000 tons of Mentougou coal, 37,000 tons of Jiaozuo coal, and a total of 273,000 tons of various other coals. This set a new record for transportation volume in recent years, fully supplying coal for industrial and agricultural use in various urban and rural areas. In particular, 69,000 tons of Kailuan coal were shipped from North China to Pukou for transfer to Shanghai under enemy air raids, making a great contribution to the industrial coal supply of Shanghai and other cities.

　　华北煤铁公司在上月份
    南运煤斤二十七万吨
    保证了上海等城市工业用煤
    【本报讯】华北煤铁公司为大量供给城乡用煤，二月份南运煤斤达二十七万余吨。按二月份恰值春节前后，该公司为抓紧铁路运输闲淡季节，达到充分供给城乡用煤目的，除事先与铁路及矿山方面取得联系，保证挂车装车外，本身也作了必要的准备工作。如检查内部手续，讨论押运方法等。很多押运员均作了工作计划，保证春节不休假、不回家（主要是古冶押运队），积极努力工作。计全月运出开滦煤九七、○○○余吨，阳泉煤五七、○○○余吨，门头沟煤三八、○○○余吨，焦作煤三七、○○○余吨及其它各种煤总计达二七三、○○○余吨。创造了年来运输量的新纪录，充分供给了各城乡工农业用煤。其中特别是开滦煤六九、○○○余吨，是在敌机窜扰下，由华北运往浦口转上海的，对上海等城市的工业用煤贡献很大。（润章）
