　　The American Secret Service - The Federal Bureau of Investigation
    The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is an important secret service agency of the United States government. It uses all kinds of despicable and dirty means, mainly to sabotage and harm the progressive movement within the United States.
    The FBI was established in 1908 as an official agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. It was originally named the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice and only took its current name in 1924 when E. Hoover became the director. As early as 1943 during the war, the FBI had 4,600 plainclothes detectives. After the war, the number of plainclothes detectives continued to increase, reaching 14,300 by 1946. The bureau also has many detectives who are not counted as formal staff.
    The FBI has carried out countless criminal activities.
    The first to suffer persecution from the FBI was the vanguard of the American working class—the Communist Party. Since 1919, the bureau has deported 124 communists to date. After the war, the bureau successively arrested more than 50 leaders of the American Communist Party and heads of local branches, including the twelve leaders, including Dennis, who were arrested in October of last year.
    The FBI has conducted investigations into the ideology, life, and actions of two million federal civil servants and 100,000 people involved in atomic energy work, and forced them to take "loyalty" oaths. Recently, the bureau falsely accused 369 employees of the U.S. Department of Commerce of having "communist suspicions."
    Sabotaging the labor movement is another major task of the FBI. Its methods include assigning agents to infiltrate trade unions to carry out sabotage activities, fabricating facts, falsely accusing trade unions, arresting workers, and applying cruel private punishments in order to achieve the goal of sabotaging the labor movement.
    In addition to openly carrying out anti-communist and anti-democratic sabotage activities, the FBI also frequently sends agents to secretly infiltrate various progressive organizations to engage in internal traitor activities. In January of this year, the investigation by the National Review Committee of the American Communist Party found that FBI personnel and old enemy agent Launart had infiltrated the party to carry out active internal traitor activities.
    As for despicable acts such as eavesdropping on telephones and intercepting private letters, they have become the daily work of the bureau.
    The criminal activities of the FBI have also expanded abroad and into many foreign diplomatic missions in the United States. Since 1937, the bureau has established a spy network in Latin America. Its influence has now extended into various political parties and government departments in Latin American countries. At the same time, the FBI's espionage activities have also infiltrated Canada. They cooperate with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to jointly compile a "loyalty" list of Canadians. In September of last year, an American official in an important position in the United Nations Secretariat revealed that the FBI had placed United Nations officials at Lake Success under special surveillance.
    The FBI, in cooperation with the U.S.'s other foreign intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, has established centers in Paris, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia, preparing to launch its criminal activities on a larger scale in order to sabotage people's democratic countries and the progressive movement around the world.

### 美国的特务机关——联邦调查局

　　美国的特务机关——联邦调查局
    联邦调查局是美国政府的一个重要特务机关，它使用一切卑鄙龌龊的手段，主要是对美国国内的进步运动进行破坏和暗害。
    联邦调查局成立于一九○八年，是属于美国司法部的一个官方机构，原名司法部调查局，一九二四年Ｅ·胡佛担任局长时，才改用现名。早在战时的一九四三年，联邦调查局就拥有四千六百名便衣侦探。战后，该局的便衣侦探继续增加，到一九四六年时，已增至一万四千三百名。该局还拥有许多不算作正式工作人员的侦探。
    联邦调查局曾经进行了无数次的罪恶活动。
    首先遭受联邦调查局迫害的是美国工人阶级的先锋队——共产党。自一九一九年以来，到目前为止，该局已放逐了一百二十四位共产党人。战后，该局先后逮捕了美共领袖及地方支部负责人五十多人，包括前年十月被逮捕的但尼斯等十二位领袖在内。
    联邦调查局曾对二百万联邦公务人员和十万与原子能工作有关的人员进行思想、生活和行动的侦查，并强迫他们履行“忠诚”宣誓。最近，该局又诬告美国商务部的三百六十九名职员，说他们有“共产党嫌疑”。
    破坏工人运动为联邦调查局的另一主要工作，其方式为指派特务打入工会，进行破坏活动，捏造事实，诬控工会，逮捕工人，并施用残酷的私刑，以达到破坏工人运动的目的。
    联邦调查局除公开进行反共反民主破坏活动外，还经常派遣特务人员暗地混入各种进步组织，进行内奸活动。今年一月，美共全国审查委员会进行调查的结果，发现联邦调查局人员、老敌探劳纳特曾混入党内进行积极的内奸活动。
    至于偷听电话、中途截取私人信件等等卑鄙勾当，更成为该局的日常工作。
    联邦调查局的罪恶活动，也扩展到国外和许多国家驻美的外交使团中。一九三七年起，该局在拉丁美洲设立一个间谍网。它的势力现已伸入拉丁美洲国家的各个政党及政府的各部门中。同时，联邦调查局的特务活动也渗入加拿大，他们与加拿大皇家骑警队合作，共同编制加拿大人的“忠诚”名单。去年九月，联合国秘书处一位担任重要职位的美国官员透露，联邦调查局已将成功湖的联合国官员置于特别监视之下。
    联邦调查局与美国另一对外特务机关——中央谍报局合作，已在巴黎、荷兰及南斯拉夫建立中心，准备更大规模地展开它的罪恶活动，来破坏人民民主国家和全世界的进步运动。
