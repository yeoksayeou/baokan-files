　　Launching a Democratic Movement to Raise Workers' Consciousness
    Waste Greatly Reduced at Datong Match Factory
    [Dispatch from this Newspaper] Since the launch of the democratic movement in mid-February, the Datong Match Factory has seen a significant reduction in waste. In February, the factory's employees put forward a total of 88 rationalization proposals, of which 47 were aimed at improving production. At the same time, under the influence of leading advanced workers, various workshops also achieved many successes in reducing waste. For example, Wang Cunli and Gu Erxi, members of the Youth League in the axle-pulling department, proposed a challenge competition to save raw materials. As a result, the previous norm of burning two or three boards per machine per day, sometimes even seven or eight boards, has been reduced to only ten boards burned in eight days. Calculated on the basis of three machines, this can produce 306 packages of matches. In the arranging machine section, led by Yu Dejiang, the daily output has increased from 90 carts to 100 carts. In the box-filling department, the daily loss of matchsticks was previously 60 jin, but now it is only 165 jin in six days, enough to pack 11 cases of matches. In the past, when female workers were filling boxes, they would casually throw damaged boxes on the ground, requiring two workers to pick up the boxes every day. Now, they pile the damaged boxes aside and clean them up at the end, which reduces the need for two workers.
    The launch of the democratic movement in the factory began with a thorough top-down mobilization, encouraging everyone to offer suggestions and actively participate in factory management. Then, it started with examining the leadership to dispel workers' ideological concerns and encourage them to speak out boldly. The leadership attached great importance to the opinions put forward by the workers and dealt with them accordingly, providing detailed explanations even when suggestions could not be implemented. Secondly, both commendations and criticisms were handled with particular care, after thorough investigation and with attention to absorbing the opinions of the masses, ensuring that administrative actions were never taken hastily. For example, on one occasion in the past, improper commendation of two workers aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses, which affected the unity of the workers.

　　开展民主运动提高工人觉悟
    大同火柴厂浪费大减
    【本报讯】大同火柴厂，自二月中旬开展民主运动以来，浪费现象大为减少。全厂职工在二月份共提出合理化建议八十八条，其中对改进生产的就有四十七条。同时各车间在先进工人带头影响下，还创造了很多减少浪费的成绩。如轴拔部青年团员王存礼、谷二喜为节省原料，向大家提出挑战竞赛的结果，原先每个机上每天烧两三板是平常事，甚至有时烧七八板的，现在八天中只烧了十板；若以三台机计算，能成包洋火三○六包。排列机在于德江带领下，每天由九十车增加到一○○车。装盒部过去每天损失火柴杆六十斤，现在六天才损失一六五斤，能装洋火十一箱。过去女工装盒，遇到坏盒就随便丢在地上，每天得用两个工人拾盒；现在都将坏盒堆在一边，最后清理，可减少两个工人。
    该厂民主运动的开展，首先是自上而下的深入动员，发动大家提意见，积极参加管理工厂。然后从检查领导入手，以解除工人思想顾虑，启发工人大胆说话。对于工人所提的意见，领导上十分重视并进行处理，就是办不到的也进行详细解答。其次表扬与批评均特别慎重，事先经过深入调查，并注意吸收群众意见，绝不能由行政草率处理。如过去曾有一次因表扬两个工人不当，就引起群众很大的不满，因而影响到工人的团结。
