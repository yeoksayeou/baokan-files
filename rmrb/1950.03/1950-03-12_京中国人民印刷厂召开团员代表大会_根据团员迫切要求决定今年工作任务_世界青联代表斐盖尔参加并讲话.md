[Beijing News] The Communist Youth League Committee of the China People's Printing Factory in Beijing convened its first Delegates' Meeting of League Members from March 5th to 10th, summarizing the work since the establishment of the League and adopting the tasks and work for 1950. This is the first of the Youth League organizations at all levels in Beijing to hold a Delegates' Meeting of League Members. Feigel, a representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. Since the establishment of the Youth League organization in the factory last May, under the leadership of the higher-level League Committee and the factory's Party Committee, and with the assistance of the factory administration and trade union, it has led League members to unite young workers and other workers in their efforts to restore and develop production. It has played a positive leading role, especially in accepting new work techniques and fighting against Kuomintang agents. In these works, with the ideological progress of the vast number of young people, 919 advanced young people have joined the Communist Youth League. In order to better exert the role of the League in production, promote democracy within the League and improve leadership, this Delegates' Meeting of League Members was convened. The report of Comrade Yang Bozhen, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal League Working Committee, and the speeches of responsible comrades from the Party, administration, and trade union made the representatives more clear about the central task of the factory's League, which is to play the active role of young people in doing a good job in production under the leadership of the Party, in coordination with the administration and trade union. In the discussion, the representatives realized that they should act according to the most urgent demands of young workers and League members: to learn technology, to learn knowledge of the League, to learn culture; to strengthen recreational activities and to pay attention to young people's health, love, marriage and other personal issues. They decided on the work for 1950: 1. To further exert the League's role as an assistant and positive force in production; 2. To improve branch work and strengthen League member education; 3. To closely connect with young workers and care about their personal issues. Finally, nine people, including Han Cha, were elected as members of the League Committee.
