Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th:

　　Legal expert Dr. Mei Ru'ao, former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, recently issued a statement regarding MacArthur's blatant decision to release Japanese war criminals in batches, stating: MacArthur's arbitrary and absurd measure seriously violates the interests of the Allied peoples, especially the Chinese people, and is also a provocation to all peace-loving countries in the world. Just as the Soviet Union proposed organizing a special international military tribunal to try Japanese germ warfare criminals, MacArthur repeatedly released Japanese war criminals who had already been sentenced, forming the clearest contrast between the different policies of the world peace camp and the aggressive camp.

　　Mei pointed out that MacArthur's act of releasing war criminals without authorization not only has no legal basis but also completely violates international agreements and betrays international credibility. It is an act of overreach, one hundred percent. The 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference stipulated that the Allied Commander only had the power to implement the terms of Japan's surrender, especially the surrender terms stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration. The declaration clearly stipulated the handling of war criminals, stating: "The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated." It also stated: "Stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners." However, MacArthur's actions completely violated the solemn principles of this declaration.

　　MacArthur's protection of war criminals has a long history. In the autumn of 1947, he released a large number of plutocrats and arms manufacturers under the pretext of "insufficient evidence for prosecution." At the end of 1948, he released nineteen Class A war criminals whose crimes were notorious and who had not yet been brought to trial. At the end of last year, he released more than one hundred sentenced war criminals under the pretext of "good behavior." This new method he announced is even more intensified and reckless, with the aim of releasing all sentenced Japanese war criminals. The so-called oath procedure and the provision that one-third of the sentence must be served are just a smokescreen. MacArthur can change them arbitrarily at any time. It is not difficult for us to predict that in order to collude with Japanese reactionaries and rapidly turn Japan into its colony and military base for aggression, American imperialism will unconditionally release all Japanese war criminals in the near future.

　　Mei stated: As a member who participated in the Tokyo trial, I resolutely protest MacArthur's unauthorized release of any war criminals, and especially resolutely protest the release of any war criminals who have been sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. If the crimes solemnly judged by representatives of eleven countries after two and a half years of trial can be arbitrarily changed by an American soldier, then where is international justice?

　　Mei Ru'ao finally pointed out: Everyone knows that China has been poisoned by Japanese war criminals for decades and has suffered the aggression of Japanese war criminals for more than eight years. The loss of people's lives is more than ten million, and the property loss amounts to hundreds of billions of US dollars. We can never forgive those Japanese war criminals. MacArthur's arbitrary and absurd measures seriously violate the interests of the Chinese people. As a Chinese citizen, I not only want to loudly protest, but also demand that our Central People's Government reserve all rights to arrest Japanese war criminals released by MacArthur and re-try all tried and untried Japanese war criminals. Mei stated: The Chinese people have stood up. We do not seek narrow revenge, but we must thoroughly settle the crimes of all war criminals!

### 法学专家梅汝璈发表谈话：麦克阿瑟释放日本战犯严重违反中国人民利益  我国政府应保留逮捕被释放的日本战犯及重审所有日本战犯的一切权利

　　法学专家梅汝璈发表谈话：
    麦克阿瑟释放日本战犯严重违反中国人民利益
    我国政府应保留逮捕被释放的日本战犯及重审所有日本战犯的一切权利
    【新华社北京十三日电】中国法学专家、前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈博士顷就麦克阿瑟公然决定将日本战犯分批全部释放一事发表谈话称：麦克阿瑟这一专横悖谬的措施，严重地违反了同盟国人民、特别是中国人民的利益，同时也是对世界一切爱好和平国家的一种挑衅。正当苏联提议组织特别国际军事法庭审讯日本细菌战犯的时候，麦克阿瑟竟一再大批释放已经判决的日本战犯，这形成了世界和平阵营与侵略阵营两种不同政策的最鲜明的对照。
    梅氏指出：麦克阿瑟擅自释放战犯的行为，不但毫无法律根据，而且完全违反国际协定，背弃国际信义，是百分之百的越权行为。一九四五年莫斯科外长会议规定盟军统帅仅有权执行日本投降条件，特别是波茨坦宣言中所规定的投降条件。该宣言对于战犯的处置是规定得明明白白的，宣言称：“欺骗和错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界的权威及势力，必须永久铲除。”又称：“对于日本战犯，包括虐待俘虏者在内，必须予以严厉的法律制裁。”但是麦克阿瑟所作所为却完全违背了这个宣言的庄严原则。
    麦克阿瑟庇护战犯，由来已久。在一九四七年秋天，他以“证据不足，不予起诉”为借口释放了大批财阀和军火制造商。在一九四八年底，他又释放了罪恶昭彰、尚未付审的十九名甲级战犯。去年年底，他又借口“行为良好”释放了一百多名已经判决了的战犯。这次他宣布的新办法更是变本加厉，胆大妄为，其目的在使一切已经判刑的日本战犯全部获释。办法中的所谓宣誓手续和刑期执行须满三分之一的规定，不过是一种烟幕而已，麦克阿瑟是随时随地都可任意加以改变的。我们不难预料：美帝国主义为了勾结日本反动派，使日本迅速变为它的殖民地和军事侵略基地起见，对日本战犯全部无条件的释放，为期必不在远。
    梅氏称：作为曾经参加东京审判的一员，我坚决抗议麦克阿瑟擅自释放任何战犯，特别坚决抗议释放业经远东国际法庭判刑的任何战犯。倘使十一个国家代表经过两年半审讯而郑重判决的罪刑可由一个美国军人任意改变，那末，国际的正义何在？
    梅汝璈最后指出：大家都知道，中国受日本战犯的荼毒凡数十年，遭受日本战犯的侵略八年有余，人民生命损失在一千万以上，财产损失达数百亿美元。我们对于那些日本战犯是永远不能饶恕的。麦克阿瑟这种专横悖谬的措施，严重地违反中国人民的利益。作为一个中国公民，我不但要大声疾呼地抗议，而且要求我中央人民政府保留逮捕被麦克阿瑟释放的日本战犯以及重审所有已审和未审的日本战犯的一切权利。梅氏称：中国人民已经站起来了，我们并不寻求狭义的报复，但是我们对于一切战争罪犯的罪行，必须予以彻底清算！
