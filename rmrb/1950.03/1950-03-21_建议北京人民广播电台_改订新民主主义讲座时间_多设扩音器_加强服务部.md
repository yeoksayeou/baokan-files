    Suggestions to Beijing People's Broadcasting Station: Revise the Time of the New Democracy Lectures, Install More Loudspeakers, and Strengthen the Service Department
    To the Editor:
    I read with great pleasure the Tianjin Daily's March 17th Social Services section, which stated: "In order to cooperate with the study of 'On New Democracy' by various government offices, factories, and schools, our city's People's Broadcasting Station will begin rebroadcasting the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station's lectures on 'On New Democracy' starting from the 18th of this month..." I was very happy to see this, because it will help every comrade who is studying "On New Democracy." However, when we calculated the broadcast dates and times, we were greatly disappointed. Of the eight broadcast dates specified by the station, seven are Saturdays and one is Monday, and the broadcast time is always from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM. As far as we know, the vast majority of those studying "On New Democracy" are personnel from various government offices, factories, schools, and organizations. During the aforementioned broadcast dates and times, I am afraid that at least half of the people would like to listen but cannot due to work and time constraints. What a great loss this is for them!
    I suggest that, to the extent possible, the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station should change the broadcast time of these lectures to the spare time of the majority of the working people, especially those in government offices, factories, and schools, i.e., around 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM every day; or, if the time is not changed, the broadcast dates should be changed to Sundays. (It is best not to change it to Saturday afternoons, because some government offices and general factories do not rest on Saturday afternoons.)

    To the Editor:
    Please forward the following opinions to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station:
    1.  Although there are many radios in Beijing, the broad masses of the working people cannot enjoy them. Therefore, I think loudspeakers can be set up in various squares (such as Tiananmen Square, Dongdan), parks, or people's education centers and streetcar stops, so that most citizens can hear the broadcast.
    2.  The service department attached to the radio station should be greatly strengthened, and clear service regulations should be formulated. It would be best to supply radio equipment at low prices (of course, this should not cause the state to lose money), and repair and install radios for citizens.

### 建议北京人民广播电台  改订新民主主义讲座时间  多设扩音器·加强服务部

    建议北京人民广播电台  改订新民主主义讲座时间
    多设扩音器·加强服务部
    编辑同志：
    阅天津日报三月十七日社会服务版刊载：本市人民广播电台为配合各机关、工厂、学校“新民主主义论”的学习，自本月十八日起，开始转播北京人民电台广播的“新民主主义论”讲座……。我看了非常高兴，因为这样会帮助每一个学习“新民主主义论”的同志的学习的。但是我们一计算广播的日期和时间，却大为失望了。因为在该台规定所广播的八次日期中，有七次是星期六，一次是星期一，而广播的时间，却都是在上午十时至十一时。据我们了解，现在在学习“新民主主义论”的人员中，各机关、工厂、学校、团体的人要占绝大多数。而在上列的广播日期和时间中，恐怕至少要有过半的人们愿意收听而因为工作和时间的关系不能收听的。这在他们是如何大的一件损失呢！
    我建议：在可能范围内，北京人民广播电台应把这种讲座的广播时间改为大多数劳动人民尤其是各机关、工厂、学校的业余时间，即每日的晚上六时半至十时半左右；或者时间不变更，而把广播的日期改为星期日。（最好不要改为星期六下午，因为有些机关及一般的工厂等在星期六下午是不休息的。）
    天津多伦道二七二号  张雪楼编辑同志：
    请把以下意见转告北京市人民广播电台：
    一、北京市收音机虽然不少，但广大劳动群众则无法享有。因此我觉得可以在各广场（如天安门、东单）、公园或人民教育馆及电车站设立扩音器，使多数市民都能听到广播。
    二、电台附设的服务部，应该大力增强，并订出明确的服务规章来。最好能廉价供应无线电器材（当然不应该使国家赔钱），并代市民修理和按装无线电收音机。
