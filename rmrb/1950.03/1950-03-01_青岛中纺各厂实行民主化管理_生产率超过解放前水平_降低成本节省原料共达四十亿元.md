　　Qingdao China Textile Factories Implement Democratic Management
    Productivity Exceeds Pre-Liberation Levels
    Cost Reduction and Raw Material Savings Total Forty Billion Yuan
    [Qingdao News] Over the past seven months, Qingdao China Textile factories have overfulfilled their production plans, with productivity exceeding pre-liberation levels, leading to reduced costs. The company has eight textile factories in Qingdao, with 360,000 spindles, 7,360 looms, and 26,000 kilowatts of power. It also has a printing and dyeing factory, a machinery factory, a knitting factory, a shuttle factory, and a chemical factory. The company employs over 21,000 workers. Its scale is second only to Shanghai China Textile, with spindles accounting for one-tenth of the total in East China, making it the leader of light industry in Shandong. In the past, under the plunder of imperialism and the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, employees had low morale. Seventy percent of raw cotton relied on foreign cotton. Before liberation, it was basically in a state of semi-shutdown. After liberation, with the assistance of all employees, the company carried out the takeover and prepared for resumption of work. At the same time, the Ministry of Trade overcame various difficulties and solved the raw cotton supply problem. Therefore, production quickly resumed one week after liberation. At the beginning of liberation, each factory successively established a trade union preparatory committee and a temporary management committee. These committees led the employees in production, and systematically carried out employee education through large classes and rotational training courses, which initially improved employee awareness. Subsequently, a production inspection campaign was launched, inspiring employees with the idea of democratic management and reversing the initially depressed production mood. By September, trade unions were formally established in all factories, and a large number of employees participated. Factory management committees were also established during this period. Based on this, a production competition was launched, triggering a red flag movement, and the output of each department gradually increased. For example, the spinning department increased production from 0.436 pounds of yarn per spindle per ten hours to 0.49 pounds. The spinning department of the No. 1 factory, due to improved cotton allocation methods and machine arrangements, achieved a production of 0.65 pounds of 32-count yarn per spindle per 20 hours, exceeding the highest standard of 0.64 pounds during the Japanese occupation. The weaving department increased production from an average of 25.89 to 32.8 yards of cloth per machine per ten hours before liberation to 41 yards. The total production in the past seven months exceeded the original plan by 66,612.75 pieces of yarn and 35,829 bolts of cloth.

    During the production campaign, due to the high labor enthusiasm shown by the employees of each factory, more than 100 production technologies were improved, creating unprecedented new records in reducing costs and saving raw materials. From January to May before liberation, the company used an average of 410.82 jin of cotton per piece of 20-count yarn and 11.19 pounds of yarn per bolt of 12-pound fine cloth. From June to November after liberation, the company used an average of 401.19 jin of cotton per piece of yarn and 11.09 pounds of yarn per bolt of cloth. The cost of yarn was reduced by an average of 1.7% compared to before liberation, and the cost of cloth was also reduced by 0.7%, saving a total of over 4 billion RMB. Thanks to the multiple efforts of the trade departments, the raw cotton supply was resolved, and the factory's operating rate has exceeded pre-liberation records. By September, the company changed from initial daytime shifts to full shifts. The spinning department's operating rate exceeded the operating rate from January to May before liberation by 5.7%, and the weaving department also increased.

    The company has also achieved results in reforming the bureaucratic capital system and establishing a new and reasonable management system, due to mastering the principle of steady and in-depth progress. First, a democratic management system and inspection system were initially established, abolishing the surveillance and patrol system of the past, where superiors and subordinates were isolated and distrustful of each other. The security organization was changed, and fire protection facilities were increased. Based on improving employee awareness, the body search system was abolished. Other measures, such as the adjustment of some unreasonable wage systems and changes in the personnel system, have improved the working class's awareness and labor enthusiasm. However, the company still showed a lack of planning in production, serious waste phenomena have not been completely overcome, and the corrupt systems left by bureaucratic capital enterprises have not been fundamentally transformed. In the production tasks for 1950, it is necessary to continue to implement the reform of the old system, realize enterprise management, democratize management, carry out a production and conservation campaign to oppose waste, improve product quality, consolidate output, and reduce costs. To this end, it is necessary to further rely on and mobilize the initiative and creativity of employees to ensure the completion of production tasks.

### 青岛中纺各厂实行民主化管理  生产率超过解放前水平  降低成本节省原料共达四十亿元

　　青岛中纺各厂实行民主化管理
    生产率超过解放前水平
    降低成本节省原料共达四十亿元
    【青岛讯】青岛市中纺各厂，七个月来超额完成生产计划，生产率且较解放前提高，成本因之降低。该公司在青设有纺织厂八处，三十六万纱锭，七千三百六十台织机，两万六千千瓦动力，并附有印染、机械、针织、梭管、化工各一厂，拥有职工两万一千余人。其规模仅次于上海中纺，纱锭占华东总数的十分之一，为山东轻工业之冠。过去在帝国主义掠夺和国民党反动派摧残下，员工生产情绪低落，原棉供应百分之七十仰赖外棉，至解放前基本上已处于半停顿状态。解放后，依靠全体员工的协助，一面进行接管，一面筹划复工；同时，贸易部克服了种种困难，解决了原棉供应问题，故解放一周后即迅速复工生产。各厂于解放之初，先后成立了工会筹委会和临时管委会，一面领导职工进行生产，同时通过上大课及轮训班的形式系统的进行职工教育，因而职工觉悟初步提高。继又开展生产检查运动，启发了职工民主管理的思想，扭转了初期一度消沉的生产情绪。至九月间，各厂普遍正式成立工会，大批职工纷纷参加；工厂管委会亦于此期间先后建立，就在这一基础上展开了生产竞赛，掀起红旗运动，各部产量逐渐上升。如纺部由初期每十小时每锭产纱○·四三六磅增为○·四九磅，一厂纺部由于改进了配棉法和机车排列，使三十二支纱每锭二十小时产量达○·六五磅，超过日寇统治时代○·六四磅的最高标准；织部则由解放前每台机十小时平均产布二五·八九至三二·八码增为四十一码。七个月来的生产总额，超过原来计划增产纱六六六一二·七五件，布三五八二九匹。
    在生产运动中，由于各厂职工表现了高度的劳动热情，改进生产技术百余种，在降低成本节省原料上也创造了空前的新纪录。解放前一至五月份，该公司二十支纱平均每件用棉四一○·八二市斤，十二磅细布每匹平均用纱一一·一九磅；解放后六至十一月份每件纱平均用棉四○一·一九市斤，布每匹平均用纱一一·○九磅。纱的成本较解放前平均降低百分之一·七，布的成本也降低百分之○·七，两项共节省人民币四十余亿。由于贸易部门的多方努力，原棉供应得到解决，该厂开工率亦已超过解放前的纪录。至九月份，该公司即由初期的白日轮流开工改为开全工，纺部开工率较解放前一至五月开工率超过百分之五·七，织部亦有增加。
    该公司对官僚资本统治制度的改革和建立新的合理的管理制度方面，由于掌握了稳步深入的方针，亦已获得成绩。首先是初步建立了民主管理制度和检查制度，废除了过去上下隔膜互不信任的监视和巡视制；改变了警卫组织，增加了消防设施；在提高职工觉悟的基础上，废除了搜身制度；其他如部分不合理的工资制度的调整，人事制度的改变等，都提高了工人阶级的觉悟和劳动热情。但该公司在生产中还表现了缺乏计划性，严重的浪费现象还未完全克服，官僚资本企业留下的腐败制度还未获得根本的改造。在一九五○年的生产任务中，要继续贯彻改革旧制度，实现经营企业化，管理民主化，开展生产节约反对浪费运动，提高成品质量，巩固产量，达到降低成本。为此，必须进一步依靠与发动职工的积极性和创造性，保证生产任务的完成。
