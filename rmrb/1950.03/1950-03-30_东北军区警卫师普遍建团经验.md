The Northeast Military Region Guard Division began its work of universally establishing Communist Youth League branches on November 22nd of last year. A total of 1,552 members were developed, accounting for 18% of the total number of young people in the division. The establishment of the League branches played a significant role in the troops.

The Gains of Establishing League Branches

(1) Inspired the ambition of young people: After the troops received education on establishing League branches, young soldiers and cadres were greatly inspired. They generally reflected: establishing League branches can educate young people to make progress. For example, Guo Zhixing of the 9th Company of the 3rd Regiment said: "Our future work must be good. With so many party members and a Communist Youth League, if we work together and bring the intermediate and backward elements up, how can the company's work not be done well!" A slogan was widely put forward among the masses: "Strive to join the League with practical work; young people should first strive to join the League, and adults should strive to join the Party." According to statistics from four companies directly under the 3rd Regiment, 89 soldiers who usually performed poorly improved their understanding and became active. (2) Improved enthusiasm for military training: According to statistics from the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment, the average increase in grenade throwing performance was two meters in just one week after the establishment of the League branches. A certain regiment closely cooperated with the training work during the establishment of League branches, and the shooting performance exceeded the requirements of the military region. 940 people in the entire regiment received awards. A military instructor reflected: "Establishing League branches really works, the soldiers are more energetic than before!" The enthusiasm for cultural learning in the troops also increased with the establishment of the League branches. All units in the division universally and automatically bought pens, paper, and slate, and other learning tools. People who were unwilling to learn culture in the past also became active. (3) Activated the cultural life of the troops: The blackboards in each company were universally produced more frequently during the establishment of League branches. The 8th Company of the 3rd Regiment used to have no manuscripts for the wall newspaper, but now many manuscripts cannot be published. Each company held evening parties, staged plays, sang songs, and composed quick ballads, creating a lively and joyful atmosphere. Many soldiers who were "shy" in the past and did not participate in cultural and recreational activities are now vying to participate. Each company of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment established a club during the establishment of League branches. At the same time, the life of the troops has become more disciplined. For example, it used to take more than ten minutes for the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment to assemble, but now people arrive as soon as the whistle blows. (4) Consolidated the troops: The period of establishing League branches was the time after the streamlining and reorganization. The work of establishing League branches played a significant role in consolidating the troops. The young people in each unit were very active under the slogan of striving to join the League. For example, Communist Youth League member Zhang Hongcai was commended for his consolidation work. Xue Shifu of the 8th Company of the 2nd Regiment guaranteed to the branch that he would help transform the backward soldier Zhang Wenxue. The relatively backward comrades in each company were influenced by progress during the establishment of League branches. (5) Improved the relationship between the Party and the masses and improved the Party's prestige. In the past, it was more common for Party members to talk to the masses. During the establishment of League branches, the broad masses took the initiative to move closer to the Party, asking Party members to be introducers, requesting to join the League, hoping to point out shortcomings, and help them make progress. Many Party members were too busy to attend to everyone.

Shortcomings in the Work

The shortcomings in the Guard Division's work of establishing League branches are that some cadres have a poor understanding of the League-building documents and have an unstable grasp of the standards for League members. For example, the Guard 1st Company directly under the Division did not adopt the method of self-reporting and public discussion, but evaluated each young person, and arbitrarily drafted additional conditions for joining the League. In the public discussion of the 4th Company of the 3rd Regiment, 13 people who applied to join the League were evaluated in one night, and they were considered passed with a few words. These were corrected by the leadership in a timely manner.

Four Points of Experience

The main experiences in establishing League branches are as follows:

(1) Take the Party as the core, connect with the masses, and mobilize Party members to build League branches together: During the key establishment of League branches, the Division and Regiment sent working groups to the 4th Company of the 1st Regiment to help with the work of establishing League branches. Because the company branch did not play a major role and relied on the working group to do it, the results were not good. In the universal establishment of League branches, this lesson was learned, and attention was first paid to mobilizing cadres and Party members, requiring everyone to build League branches together. After the work of establishing League branches began, there were often many young people applying to join the League. Party members and cadres with prestige were too busy, so the branch mobilized all Party members to divide the work and contact the masses. Each young person who requested to be introduced to the League was interviewed individually, their strengths and weaknesses were pointed out, and it was indicated that they would be helped to make progress in the future. If the application was not approved, they were helped to find the direction of progress and encouraged. Therefore, the young people whose applications were not approved generally had very few emotional fluctuations. (2) Combine with the central work of the troops, and build League branches in practical work: For example, a certain regiment combined with shooting training, and the 4th Company of the 2nd Regiment combined with the streamlining and reorganization work, calling on young people to strive to join the League in practical actions. In this way, the work of establishing League branches proceeded very smoothly, and the effect of educating young people was also great, which promoted training and consolidating the troops. (3) Closely connect with the characteristics of the young people in the troops and carry out diverse propaganda and education. The content of education should focus on explaining the League Constitution: Young people in the troops are generally full of vigor, have a strong desire to improve, and learn and progress quickly; the shortcomings are that they rely more on enthusiasm for work and lack experience and cultural knowledge. Therefore, we should grasp these characteristics and explain the importance of young people in the construction of national defense forces; explain the basic tasks of the Communist Youth League. This is of great educational significance for both young and adult soldiers. In the work of establishing League branches, each company held evening parties, Q&A sessions, etc., which were very popular among the soldiers. Not only did it help the work of establishing League branches, but it also solved many ideological problems of the soldiers. (4) The leading organs should formulate clear work steps and make good preparations. For this establishment of League branches in the Guard Division, first, from September 26th to October of last year, the Political Department of the Division held a training class for young cadres. Then, key League branches were established in each regiment to gain experience before the universal establishment of League branches began. After the work of establishing League branches began, speaking materials, lecture outlines, etc. were printed and distributed, and two issues of pictorials were published to introduce quick reports, small dramas, and other materials. Finally, materials such as "How to Hold a Swearing-in Conference" and "How to Live the Organizational Life of the League" were issued. In addition, in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the Northeast Military Region, the regimental Party committee checked whether the conditions for establishing League branches in the companies were mature, and paid attention to correcting the deviations in establishing League branches at any time. These are very important. (Forward Daily)

### 东北军区警卫师普遍建团经验

　　东北军区警卫师普遍建团经验
    东北军区警卫师自去年十一月二十二日起，开展了普遍建团工作。总计发展了一千五百五十二名团员，占全师青年总数的百分之十八。建团工作在部队中起了显著的作用。
  建团工作的收获
    （一）启发了青年的上进心：部队经过建团教育后，青年战士和干部首先受到很大的启发，普遍反映：建团能教育青年进步。如三团九连郭志兴说：“咱们今后的工作一定得好，有这么多的党员，再组织青年团，两下努把力把中间的、落后的往上一带，连里工作还有搞不好的！”群众中普遍提出一个口号：“要拿实际工作来争取入团；青年首先争取入团，成年争取入党。”据三团直属队四个连队的统计，就有八十九名平时表现较差的战士提高了认识，积极起来了。（二）提高了练兵情绪：据三团一营统计，仅在建团后一周时间内，投弹成绩平均增进两米。某团在建团中与练兵工作密切配合，打靶成绩超过了军区的要求，全团有九百四十人受奖。一位军事教员反映说：“建团真起作用，战士比过去劲大啦！”部队文化学习的情绪亦随建团而更趋高涨，全师各部普遍自动买笔、买纸、买石板等学习用具。过去不愿学文化的人也积极起来了。（三）活跃了部队的文化生活：建团中各连队的黑板报普遍出得更勤了。三团八连过去墙报没稿子，现在许多稿子登不上。各连都开晚会、排戏、唱歌、编快板，造成了活泼愉快的空气。许多战士过去“害臊”不参加文娱工作，现在却抢着参加了。三团一营各连在建团中都建立了俱乐部。同时，部队生活也更加紧张。如二团二营过去集合需十几分钟，现在哨子一响，人就到齐了。（四）巩固了部队：建团时期正是精简整编以后，建团工作在巩固部队上起到了很大作用。各单位青年在争取入团的口号下表现很积极。如青年团员张洪才在巩固工作上受到了通报表扬；二团八连薛世福向支部保证要帮助改造落后战士张文学。各连比较落后的同志都在建团中受到了进步的影响。（五）改善了党群关系，提高了党的威信。过去是党员找群众谈话较多；建团中广大群众都主动地向党靠拢，找党员作介绍人，要求入团，希望指出缺点，帮助进步。许多党员忙得应接不暇。
  工作中的缺点
    警卫师建团工作中的缺点，是部分干部对建团文件学习体会差，对团员标准也掌握不稳。如师直警卫一连不是采取自报公议的方式，而把每个青年都评一下，并擅自另拟入团条件；三团四连在公议中，一晚评了十三名申请入团的群众，三言两语就算通过。这些都经领导上及时纠正。
    四点经验
    建团工作中的经验，主要有下列几点：
    （一）以党为核心，联系群众，发动党员大家动手建团：在重点建团时，师、团曾派工作组到一团四连帮助建团工作，由于连支部没有起主要作用，依赖工作组去搞，结果成绩不好。在普遍建团中接受了此一教训，首先注意动员干部及党员，要求大家动手建团。当建团工作开始后，申请入团的青年经常很多，有威信的党员干部忙不过来，便由支部发动全体党员分工与群众联系。对要求介绍入团的青年，一一进行个别谈话，指出其优缺点，并表示以后要多帮助其进步。如果申请未被批准，则帮助其找出进步的方向，给以鼓励。因此，未被批准入团的青年，情绪上一般都很少波动。（二）结合部队中心工作，在实际工作中建团：如某团结合打靶练兵、二团四连结合精简整编工作，号召青年在实际行动中争取入团。这样，建团工作进行很顺利，所收教育青年的作用也较大，对练兵和巩固部队等都起了推动作用。（三）密切联系部队青年的特点，进行多样的宣传教育。教育内容应以解释团章为中心：部队青年一般富有朝气，上进心强，学习进步快；而缺点则是对工作多凭热情，缺乏经验与文化知识。因此应掌握这些特点，说明青年在国防军建设上的重要性；说明青年团的基本任务。这样对青年与成年战士的教育意义都很大。在建团工作中，各连队都开晚会、开答辩会等，很受战士欢迎，不独有助于建团工作，并解决了战士许多思想上的问题。（四）领导机关应订出明确的工作步骤，作好准备工作。警卫师此次建团，首先在去年九月二十六日至十月由师政治部举办了青年干部训练班；接着在各建制团进行了重点建团，取得经验后，才开始普遍建团。在建团工作开始后，又印发了讲话材料、讲课提纲等，并出了两期画报，介绍快报、小剧等材料。末后又发出“怎样开宣誓大会”、“怎样过团的组织生活”等材料。此外，并按东北军区规定的条件，由团党委检查连队建团条件是否成熟，并随时注意纠正建团中的偏向，这些都是很重要的。（前进报）
