Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou and Other Railway Sub-bureaus Sign Master-Apprentice Contracts One After Another
Master-Apprentice Relationship Improves, Young Workers' Skills Improve Rapidly

[This newspaper reported] Since the Shijiazhuang Sub-bureau of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's Rolling Stock Inspection Section signed master-apprentice contracts, the master-apprentice relationship has improved significantly, and the skills of the apprentices have improved rapidly. After liberation, there were abnormal phenomena in the master-apprentice relationship in this section. The masters had the old-fashioned view of keeping their skills secret and were unwilling to teach their apprentices wholeheartedly. The apprentices were not modest in learning and were ambitious. This not only affected production but also hindered the unity of masters and apprentices. To correct this bad phenomenon, party, Youth League, and trade union organizations in various factories and sections conducted education on the above-mentioned erroneous views to break through ideological barriers. Some trade unions also held discussion meetings. However, some old workers still had ideological concerns, fearing that teaching their skills to others would deprive them of their livelihood. Under the influence and education of the Youth League members, the apprentices began to change their past attitudes, being able to learn humbly and respect their masters. As a result, the masters were moved and gradually changed their past attitude of disliking apprentices. On this basis, under the leadership of the administration, the Party, and the trade union, the Rolling Stock Inspection Section implemented collective apprenticeship and mentoring according to the nature of the work. After full discussion between the master and apprentice, the master-apprentice contracts clearly stipulated the learning period, apprentice performance evaluation, master reward methods, and inspection systems. A grand collective apprenticeship ceremony was held. Each group formulated its own contract according to its specific situation and implemented it with the approval of the management committee. For example, the masters of the second, third, and fourth groups of C-Inspection guaranteed to improve the qualifications of the twelve apprentices to the level of assistant car inspectors within two and a half months. The apprentices also guaranteed to respect the masters, study hard, and not bargain about job assignments. Each group also stipulated various learning systems to ensure the realization of the plan; competitions were launched between the groups to improve learning enthusiasm. Due to the correction of the relationship between masters and apprentices and the teaching attitude, the skills of the apprentices have improved rapidly. For example, apprentice Jia Guiru learned to charge, discharge, and adjust specific gravity after one week of study, which used to take at least two or three months to learn. Master Li Delin of the braking group taught the apprentices the structure and principle of the K-type and P-type passenger car three-motion valves in a short period of time. Some apprentices learned the simple theory of flat welding, making welding rods, and using oxygen in just ten days and remembered the procedures for each job clearly.

[This newspaper reported] The Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau of the Tianjin Railway Bureau and the Fengtai Rolling Stock Inspection Section have signed master-apprentice contracts one after another to improve the skills of young workers and cultivate construction talents. The Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau started the signing in early January, focusing on the locomotive section and the electrical section. These two sections have a total of 209 workers, of which young workers account for 58. After liberation, due to the improvement of workers' political consciousness, young workers eagerly demanded to learn skills; however, some old workers still had the conservative view of keeping their skills secret and were unwilling to teach them wholeheartedly. In addition to conducting individual talks and holding forums for young and old workers to dispel ideological concerns, each section took the lead in demonstrating advanced old workers. Then, on the basis of voluntary participation, a grand apprenticeship ceremony was held, and master-apprentice contracts were signed. Master Fan Long of the electrical section guaranteed to teach five skills, including magnetic, automatic telephone, block machine, dispatcher, and electric board machine, within half a month. Master Li Yanxiang of the locomotive section guaranteed to teach the principles and practical working ability of locomotive generators and lines within five months. In addition to guaranteeing to study hard and complete the learning plan on schedule, the apprentices also proposed conditions such as respecting the masters. Since the Fengtai Locomotive Section signed master-apprentice contracts, it has achieved significant results in the past three months. For example, apprentice Bai Shuchang learned to pick out two kinds of screws in one day, and Cao Fengqi, who stipulated in the contract to learn ten kinds of work, has now learned nine kinds. A few days ago, when the master took a leave of absence, he was able to replace the master's work. Moreover, since the signing of master-apprentice contracts, the unity between old and young workers has been strengthened, the conservative concepts left over from feudal society have been eliminated, and the skills of young workers have been rapidly improved.

　　石家庄、张家口等铁路分局纷纷签订师徒合同
    师徒关系改善青工技术迅速提高
    【本报讯】太原铁路局石家庄分局检车段自签订师徒合同后，师徒关系已获显著改善，学徒技术迅速提高。解放后，该段在师徒关系上存在不正常现象，师傅有保守技术的陈旧观点，不愿放手教徒弟；徒弟也不虚心学习，好高鹜远。这非但影响生产，而且妨害了师徒团结。为纠正这种不良现象，各厂段的党、团、工会等组织，针对上述错误观点分别进行教育，打通思想。有的工会并举行座谈会。但有些老工人还是有思想顾虑，害怕把技术教给了别人，使自己生活失去依据。徒弟们在青年团员的影响和教育下，开始改变过去的态度，能虚心学习，尊敬师傅。因而师傅受到感动，也逐渐转变了过去嫌弃学徒的态度。在这一基础上，检车段在行政、党、工会的领导下，按工作性质分别实行集体拜师、带徒弟，并经过师徒双方充分的讨论，具体明确的规定了学习期限、学徒考绩，奖励师傅办法及检查制度等方面的师徒合同，举行了隆重的集体拜师的仪式。各组则根据具体情况，订立各组的合同，并经管委会批准执行。如丙检第二、三、四小组的师傅们，保证把十二名徒弟在二个半月内提高到帮检车道的资格；徒弟也保证尊重师傅，努力学习，分配工作不讲价钱。各组并规定了各种学习制度，以保证计划的实现；各组间又发动了竞赛，以提高学习情绪。由于端正了师徒间的关系和教学态度，学徒技术迅速提高。如学徒贾桂茹经过一礼拜的学习，就学会了充电、放电、调整比重等工作，这在过去至少要二、三月才能学会。制动组师傅李德林在短时期内教会了徒弟Ｋ型和Ｐ型客车三动阀的构造和原理。有的徒弟仅十天功夫就学会了平焊、造电焊棍和使用氧气的简单理论，对每一工作的程序，也记得很清楚。

    【本报讯】天津铁路局张家口分局及丰台检车段为提高青年工人技术，培养建设人材，纷纷签订师徒合同。张家口分局是以机务段和电务段为重点，于一月初开始订立。该两段共有工人二百零九人，其中青工即占五十八人。解放后由于工人政治觉悟提高，青工迫切要求学习技术；但有些老工人仍然存有技术保守观点，不肯放手教人。各段除进行个别谈话，召开青老工人座谈会解除思想顾虑外，并以先进老工人带头示范，然后在自觉自愿的基础上，隆重的举行了拜师傅大会，订立师徒合同。电务段师傅樊龙保证半个月内教会磁石、自动两种电话与闭塞机、调度机、电板机等五项技术。机务段师傅李延祥保证在五月内教会机车的发电机及线路的原理及实际工作能力。学徒们除保证努力学习，按期完成学习计划外，并提出尊敬师傅等条件。丰台机务段自订立师徒合同后，三个月来已有显著收获。如学徒白树常一天功夫就学会了挑二样螺丝，曹凤岐在合同里规定学会十样活计，现在已会了九样，前些日子师傅告了假，他已能代替师傅工作了。并且自订师徒合同后，老、青工友间已加强了团结，消除了封建社会遗留下来的保守观念，迅速的提高了青工的技术。（田珍、柴焕文、沈亦非、丰台检车段通讯组）
