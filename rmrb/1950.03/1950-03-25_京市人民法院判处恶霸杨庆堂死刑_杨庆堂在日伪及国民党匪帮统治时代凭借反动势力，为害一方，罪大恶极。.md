    Beijing People's Court Sentences Local Tyrant Yang Qingtang to Death
    Yang Qingtang Relied on Reactionary Forces to Harm One Side During the Era of Japanese Puppet and Kuomintang Bandit Rule, and His Crimes Were Heinous.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to news from the Beijing News Agency: Yang Qingtang (also known as Yang Ruixuan), a local tyrant and landlord from Ruihezhuang, Fourteenth District, Beijing Suburbs, relied on reactionary forces during the era of Japanese寇 and Kuomintang bandit rule. He colluded with bureaucrats, warlords, bandits, and hoodlums to cruelly oppress and exploit peasants, running rampant in the Nanyuan and Daxing areas for more than twenty years. He also assigned henchmen to lead puppet troops to kill our revolutionary cadres Liang Qi and two others, as well as workers Li Guoqing and two others. This case has been concluded by the Beijing People's Court; Yang Qingtang was sentenced to death. Yang Qingtang is currently fifty-seven years old. Since the age of twenty-four, he has successively held false positions such as the head of the puppet police station, a puppet senator, and a puppet National Assembly representative. At the same time, he engaged in land management, cruelly exploiting peasants. At its peak, he accumulated four to five thousand mu of land. He also frequently manipulated his henchmen to engage in anti-people activities. In 1945, when our army liberated the Ruihezhuang area of Nanyuan and established a people's democratic government, implementing people's democratic policies, the local tyrant landlord Yang Qingtang immediately directed his henchman, Li Yingjun, the puppet Daxing County Magistrate, to dispatch Feng Zhaowen, the captain of the puppet self-defense force of the county, to lead puppet troops to invade Ruihezhuang twice on September 17th and 20th, successively arresting Liang Qi, the director of the Taihezhuang Workers' Union, Cao Guowei, the director of the Ruihezhuang Anti-Japanese Association, Shen Jinrong, the militia instructor, and workers Li Guoqing and more than forty others. Liang Qi, Cao Guowei, and Shen Jinrong were brutally tortured and then shot and killed; Li Guoqing was buried alive by the bandit army; Cao Guojun's father, a militiaman, was severely beaten and died of his injuries. Under the instigation of the Kuomintang bandit gang, Yang Qingtang also organized a "Volunteer Corps," engaging in rape, robbery, and persecution of the people in the Caiyu and Maqiao areas on the periphery of our district at that time. On weekdays, he also used money to collude with bandits Liu Wenju and An Qingdao gang leader Tao Wu and others to run rampant, monopolize litigation, and control the puppet Daxing County administration. The perpetrator was involved in all measures taken by the county and the people, such as extorting peasants and organizing "self-defense forces." When renting out land, he illegally exploited peasants by relying on reactionary forces, often exchanging white land for wheat fields and sandy land for good land. After the liberation of Beijing, the perpetrator went into hiding in the city. Last winter, when Ruihezhuang Village carried out land reform, all three hundred and fifteen members of the village's farmers' association successively complained to the land reform work team and party and government organs about the perpetrator's crimes. The Nanjiao Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested him on December 8th last year and sent him to the People's Court for trial. The court, considering that Yang committed heinous crimes and harmed one side, sentenced him to death.
