　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: Indonesian workers have launched a strike movement to demand higher wages, paralyzing economic life in some areas of Java and Sumatra. According to Aneta News Agency, Jakarta: Six thousand dockworkers in Semarang, Central Java, began a strike on the 2nd to demand higher wages. The Semarang dock area has come to a standstill, and the whole of Central Java is therefore unable to receive supplies of important goods such as rice. Workers in East Java also held strikes to demand higher wages and increased rice subsidies, affecting many wealthy plantations in the area. Textile factories in Bandung, West Java, have been paralyzed by the strike of 4,000 workers. Although strike leaders have compromised with the capitalists, the workers have ignored their demands to return to work. The same persistence in struggle can be seen among workers in Surabaya. The striking workers of a rubber factory there, despite being threatened by the capitalists, scabs and military intelligence spies, have consistently persisted in their strike struggle. In Medan, Sumatra, 700 public utility workers began a two-day strike on the 3rd.

　　不顾工贼与特务的威胁  印尼工人展开罢工斗争
    重要地区经济生活陷于瘫痪
    【新华社北京八日电】印尼工人为要求增加工资而展开的罢工运动，已瘫痪了爪哇和苏门答腊两岛上一些地区的经济生活。据安尼塔社雅加达讯：中爪哇三宝垅的六千码头工人为要求增加工资，于二日开始罢工。三宝垅码头区已陷于停顿状态，整个中爪哇因此得不到米粮等重要物品的供应。东爪哇的工人为要求提高工资和增加食米津贴也举行了罢工，使该地许多富庶的田庄都受到影响。西爪哇万隆的纺织工厂因为四千工人罢工而陷于麻痹。虽然罢工的领袖已和资方妥协，但工人对他们的复工要求置之不理。泗水也可以看到同样的工人坚持斗争的情形。该地一橡胶工厂的罢工工人，虽在资方与工贼和军事情报处特务的威迫之下，始终坚持着罢工斗争。在苏门答腊的棉兰，七百名公用事业工人曾于三日开始举行为期两天的罢工。
