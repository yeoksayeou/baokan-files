Several Questions Regarding Taxation

    What goods in stationery stores should be taxed?
    Q: Our stationery store has too many types of goods. We don't know which goods are taxable and which are not. We asked around to various industry peers, and they all said that only seven types of goods in stationery stores are taxable, and the rest are not. So everyone has been declaring according to these seven types of goods. Recently, we heard from others that other types of goods are also taxable, but they are not very clear either. We don't know which goods in stationery stores are taxable. Please give a detailed reply from the tax bureau so that everyone can declare taxable goods and avoid tax evasion. (A Reader)
    A: Commodity tax is divided into ten major categories. Stationery stores vary in the types and amounts of goods they carry, so taxable goods cannot be limited to only seven types or a few types. For example: rubber products subject to tax include erasers, rubber bands, etc. Hardware products subject to tax include paper clips, tacks, thumbtacks, book staples, copper wire nails, etc. Various types of paper are subject to Category B paper tax. Glass, porcelain, and pottery products subject to tax include water droppers, porcelain pen holders, etc. Other industrial products subject to tax include fountain pens, etc. We hope you can come to our bureau (No. 1 District, East Huangchenggen) or its affiliated sub-bureaus for a discussion.

    General Merchants Cannot Collect Business Tax on Behalf of Itinerant Traders
    Q: Recently, I transported a piece of goods from another location on behalf of a friend. After inspection by the tax bureau cadres, in addition to ordering me to pay commodity tax, I was also asked to provide a guarantor and fill out a supplementary business tax form. However, when I sold the goods, because the invoice issued did not have the name of a business (privately owned, not sold by a certain business), the buyer deducted 4% of the business tax (but did not give me a receipt). Therefore, please reply:
    (1) Does the buyer have the right to collect business tax on behalf of the seller? If the buyer does not deduct it, then they will have to pay it for the seller in the future, so deducting 4% for goods that have not paid business tax is not necessarily wrong. Is it?
    (2) In this case, does the seller still have to pay business tax to the tax bureau? If they don't pay, and the tax bureau investigates and there is no evidence, what should be done? (Wang Baishi)
    A: (1) Only merchants entrusted by the tax bureau to collect and pay business tax on their behalf can execute the collection, and they must issue a formal tax payment receipt (the business transaction settlement form stipulated by the tax bureau) to the seller. Otherwise, both the buyer and seller must go to the tax bureau to pay the business tax and obtain a tax payment receipt before the transaction can proceed. General merchants cannot collect business tax on behalf of itinerant traders.
    (2) If the seller has paid business tax, they must have a formal tax payment receipt. Therefore, it is impossible to levy the business tax a second time on the same type and quantity of transaction. (Beijing Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau)
　　
    Storing Undeclared Taxed Goods is Illegal
    Q: I stored several bolts of city-made cloth for a friend without paying commodity tax (because the commodity tax payment period ends at the end of March). On the 17th of this month, it was discovered by a tax officer. Should I pay the commodity tax according to regulations, or should it be treated as a violation? (Liu Bingjun)
    A: You stored untaxed cloth for a friend and did not voluntarily declare it. Since it was discovered, you should be punished according to regulations. (Beijing Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau)
　　
    How to Affix Stamps for Clock and Watch Repair Industry
    Q: I run a clock and watch repair business. When I receive a customer's clock or watch, I give the customer a wooden tag as a voucher for retrieving the item. When the customer picks it up, I issue a separate invoice. How should stamps be affixed to this tag and invoice? (Lu Zhen)
    A: (1) According to Article 6 of the current Stamp Tax Law, the voucher given to customers for picking up repaired clocks and watches should not be a wooden tag, but a document should be issued. This document should be stamped at 400 yuan per piece, according to Item 12 of the tax rate table in this bureau's Jing Shui Yi Zi No. 616 announcement (see People's Daily, March 1st, page 3).
    (2) The invoice should be issued when the customer picks up the item and pays, and cannot replace the pick-up voucher. (Beijing Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau)

    关于纳税的几个问题
　　文具店都有那些货应纳税？
    问：我们文具行货样太多，那些货物应税或不应税，我们不知，到各行家询问打听，都说文具行只有七种货有税，别的货没有税。所以大家就照以上七种货物申报的。最近又听别人说别种货也有税，可是他也不很明白。不知道文具行那些货是有税？请税局详细答复，以备大家申报应税货物，而免漏税。（一读者）
    答：货物税共分十大类，同是文具店，货物有多有少，应税货物不能限定只有七种或几种。譬如：应按橡胶品类纳税的有橡皮、橡皮圈等。应按五金类纳税的有曲别针、大头针、图钉、书钉、铜丝钉等。应按乙种纸类纳税的有各种纸张。应按玻璃、瓷、陶类纳税的有水盂、瓷笔筒等。应按工业品其他类纳税的有自来水笔等。希望能来本局（内一区东皇城根）或所属分局一谈。（北京市人民政府税务局）
　　一般商户不能代征行商税
    问：日前我由外埠代友运来货物一件，经税务局干部检查后，除令我交纳货物税外，并让我具保填了一张补交行商税条。可是当我将货物出卖时，因所开出之发票没有商号字样（为私人所有、非某商号卖货），买主已扣去行商税百分之四（但无收据给我）。因此请答复：
    （一）买主是否有权代征行商税？买主如果不扣下，那么他将来要替卖方补缴，所以对未交行商税的货扣百分之四，也未尝不是对的。是不是？
    （二）这样，卖方是否还要到税务局交行商税？不交的话，税局调查又无证据，怎么办？（王白石）
    答：（一）凡经税务局委托代征代交行商税的商户，才能执行代征，并必须开给卖方正式纳税收据（税务局制定的行商交易结账单）。否则，买卖双方须赴税务局完纳行商税，扯发纳税收据，才能进行交割。一般商户是不能代征行商税的。
    （二）卖方缴了行商税，必有正式纳税收据。因此，在同一品种和数量的交易上，不可能再征第二次行商税。（北京市人民政府税务局）
　　存放未报税的货物是不合法的
    问：我代友人存市布数匹未缴纳货物税（因货物税缴纳期至三月底止），于本月十七日被税务员查出。是照章补缴货物税呢？还是按违章论呢？（刘秉钧）
    答：你代友人存放未税布匹，并未自动申报登记，既被查获，应即照章处罚。（北京市人民政府税务局）
　　钟表修理业如何贴印花
    问：我是经营钟表修理业的。我收到顾客的钟表后，给顾客一个凭牌取物的木牌，顾客取走时，另开发票。此牌此票，印花应如何贴法？（鲁箴）
    答：（一）修理钟表业给顾客取件的凭证，按现行印花税法第六条规定，不应用木牌，须开立单据。此项单据，应按本局京税一字第六一六号公告（见人民日报三月一日第三版）税率表第十二目，每件贴印花四百元。
    （二）发货票应在顾客取件付款时开立，并不能代替取件凭证。（北京市人民政府税务局）
