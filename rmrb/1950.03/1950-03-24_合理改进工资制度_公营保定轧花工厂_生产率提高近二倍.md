　　Reasonable Improvement of the Wage System
    Public Baoding Cotton Ginning Factory Productivity Increased Nearly Twofold
    [Our Newspaper] The Baoding Xiguan Cotton Ginning Factory, under the Hebei Provincial Industrial Company, has implemented a piece-rate bonus wage system based on the principle of "to each according to his work." After democratic discussion, wage grades were assessed, and the workers' production enthusiasm significantly increased, with productivity gradually rising. Currently, the average daily output has increased nearly twofold compared to the initial period. This factory had been shut down for three years before liberation. When the Hebei Industrial Company took over in February of last year, most of the machine parts had been stolen and sold by the Kuomintang. At that time, there were only six broken ginning machines and six electric rollers, etc. After active preparation and the transfer of some workers from various public factories, formal operations began in early April of last year. Initially, due to the large differences in wage standards among workers from different factories, although preliminary adjustments were made, many unreasonable aspects remained. As a result, workers' production enthusiasm was not high, with an average daily ginning output of 290 jin per machine. After the leadership noticed this, a progressive bonus system was implemented in June, stipulating a daily ginning output of 410 jin. As a result, the average daily ginning output per machine increased to 445 jin, an increase of 53 percent compared to the previous level. As workers' production enthusiasm began to rise, the factory accepted workers' proactive suggestions for improving tools, changing the ginning machine tiles to ball bearings, and the average daily output per machine further increased to 557 jin. To thoroughly resolve the unreasonable phenomena existing in wages, the entire factory underwent democratic discussion, and grades were assessed fairly and reasonably according to each person's skills, further increasing workers' enthusiasm. For example, after increasing the labor intensity of odd job workers, the number of workers required daily was reduced from ten to six. Two-thirds of the ginning workers have learned to repair ginning machines, and they often automatically repair them during rest periods. The general daily output per machine reached 870 jin, with the highest reaching 1,260 jin. To improve product quality and strengthen the protection of production tools, the factory management committee decided to set the quota at 810 jin. With the increase in productivity, workers' welfare funds also increased by 24 percent compared to the previous period. (Yang Xuemo)

　　合理改进工资制度
    公营保定轧花工厂  生产率提高近二倍
    【本报讯】河北省实业公司所属之保定西关轧花厂，根据按劳取酬的原则，实行超额奖励工资制，并经过民主讨论，评定工资等级，工人生产情绪显著提高，生产力逐渐上升，目前每日平均产量已较最初时提高近二倍。该厂在解放前已停工三年。去年二月河北实业公司接收时，一般机器零件均被国民党盗卖，当时只有破轧车六辆及电滚子等六件。经过积极筹备工作，并由各公营工厂抽调来部分工人，在去年四月初即正式开工。开始时由于各厂工人工资标准差额很大，虽初步进行了调整，但不合理之处还很多，因此工人生产情绪不高，每日每车平均轧花二百九十斤。领导上发觉后，于六月份开始实行超额累进奖励制，规定每日轧花四百一十斤，结果每日每车平均轧花量即增至四百四十五斤，较前增加达百分之五十三。由于工人生产积极性开始提高，厂方接受了工人主动提出改进工具的意见，改轧车瓦为滚珠，每日每车平均产量又增至五百五十七斤。为彻底解决工资中部分存在着的不合理现象，全厂经过民主讨论，依照每个人的技术，公平合理的评定了等级，工人积极性更加提高。如打杂工增加劳动强度后，每日由十个工减为六个，轧花工三分之二已学会修理轧车，在休息时间经常自动修理，每车每日一般产量均达八百七十斤，最高者可达一千二百六十斤。工厂管理委员会为提高产品质量，加强爱护生产工具，故决定定额仅提高至八百一十斤。随着生产力的提高，工人福利资金亦较前增加百分之二十四。  （杨学墨）
