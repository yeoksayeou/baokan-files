Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 23rd: Large-scale unified worker recruitment by state-owned enterprises in Northeast China has begun. This is an important measure to ensure sufficient labor for this year's industrial construction and to enable full employment and stable livelihoods for the people.

According to the decision of the Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Workers Recruitment Committee, which is responsible for unified leadership of the worker recruitment work of state-owned and public-owned enterprises in Northeast China, has been established. It is composed of personnel leaders from the Northeast Labor Bureau, the Ministry of Industry, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Planning Commission, the Northeast Railway Bureau, the Forestry Bureau, Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Fushun Mining Bureau, Mechanical Industry Administration, and Nonferrous Metals Administration. A standing committee is formed by the first five units mentioned above, with the Labor Bureau taking primary responsibility. Each province and city will be responsible through its local labor bureau, cooperating with relevant departments to form local worker recruitment committees and establish employment agencies. Under the leadership of the local people's government, they will accept the tasks assigned by the Northeast Workers Recruitment Committee and be responsible for local recruitment matters. The Northeast Workers Recruitment Committee was formally established at a worker recruitment meeting held by the Labor Bureau on the 24th of last month. Based on their needs, the participating units specifically formulated the number of workers to be recruited this year and decided on the steps to be taken in the recruitment work. Except for some skilled workers who need to be recruited from within the customs (關內, i.e., other parts of China), for which recruitment teams have been organized in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanghai and are about to depart, most production, construction skilled workers, and general workers are planned to be resolved locally in Northeast China. The recruitment areas for each enterprise department have been specifically divided to ensure that recruitment work is carried out in an orderly manner. Unified regulations have also been made regarding the recruited workers' travel expenses, settlement allowances, and food expenses. Currently, provinces and cities are deploying recruitment work separately, and enterprise units have also sent people to designated areas to assist.
