　　Taipusi Shoe Industry Cooperative Grows in Difficulty
　　Guo Yun · Lu Zhe
　　In November of last year, many shoe workers in the Second District of Beijing lost their jobs. Comrades from the trade union office and Sun Shouyi, an unemployed shoe worker, held several discussions with other unemployed workers about organizing a cooperative. At the end of November, eight workers each contributed ten catties of millet (a total of eighty catties) as a fund to establish the Taipusi Street Shoe Industry Cooperative.
　　The Qingguan Bureau helped solve the problem of the cooperative's premises, but what about furniture and tools? Through the efforts of the eight workers and the help of the trade union, some scattered furniture and tools were borrowed from various sources. Winter was very cold, and there were no beds. There was no other way, so Lao Sun took the lead in sleeping on the ground. They ate cornbread every day, without even pickled vegetables. Even this was made for them by neighbors (because they had no stove). What was even more difficult was that two workers were often thinking about their families: Ah! My family has suffered a famine, how will they live? They became lazy and unmotivated when they started working. When Lao Sun saw this situation, he borrowed his severance pay and sent it home to them. Inspired by this sincere class love, the two of them became particularly active in their work. In this way, seven workers closely united around Lao Sun.
　　Everyone Takes Action to Overcome Difficulties
　　The cooperative established a cooperative affairs committee, and Lao Sun was elected as the director. At first, they did processing work, making shoe uppers, but there was no sewing machine. Lao Sun ran around trying to find one, but to no avail. The workers? They also felt that these things should be the responsibility of the leadership, and they didn't care. So work was stopped for five days. Finally, worker Han Yucai suggested: "We should all run the cooperative, solicit opinions from the masses, discuss and study together, and difficulties can be overcome." Lao Sun humbly accepted, and discussed it with everyone. At a meeting, worker Hong Guimao said: "Aren't we paid wages in advance for doing work? Let's all take out our first month's wages to buy a machine first." Everyone unanimously supported this, and the difficulty was solved. Since then, the workers have understood that to run the cooperative well, everyone must take action. Actively making suggestions to the organization has become a very common phenomenon.
　　Between Seasons
　　The cooperative developed rapidly, growing from eight people to fifteen people within ten days. By the end of December, it had grown to thirty-five people. However, the new workers did not have a good understanding of the cooperative. They thought that the cooperative was just a business started by a few people who pooled their shares, and their attitude was to work for a day and get paid for a day. They did not cherish the cooperative's public property and wasted raw materials. After discussing it with the trade union comrades, Lao Sun used the actual materials of "Cooperative Communication" to patiently educate the workers, explaining the nature of the cooperative and other issues. He also organized discussions so that the members initially realized that "the cooperative is our own." But at this time, they encountered a very big difficulty—the old work had been completed, and the new work had not yet been approved. During this transition period, work was stopped for about ten days. During these difficult ten days, some active workers and old members played a great role in supporting the situation. Worker Lu Furui's family was really poor, and his wife came to find him; he was afraid that withdrawing money from the cooperative would affect the cooperative's future, so he painfully sold his own leather shoes and took the money home to support his family. Worker Han Yongqi sold his jacket to maintain his livelihood. None of the members had the idea of leaving the cooperative and going home. For ten days, they ate only one meal a day, or even a little porridge, maintaining their lives half-hungry and half-full. Trade union worker Guo Yun also lent his subsidy of 10,000 yuan to the worker brothers. This series of facts about caring for their own cooperative further educated the worker brothers who did not yet understand the nature of the cooperative, making them truly understand that there is no labor-capital relationship in the cooperative, but it is their own.
　　Conscious Economy
　　After getting through the "dangerous" period, the hard life made the workers change in another way. For example, during the Kuomintang period, shoe workers in private stores could not make a pair of boots with four feet of face leather (because of waste), but now three feet eight inches is enough. They also launched a savings campaign. When they saw an idle lamp, they immediately ran to turn it off. The members pulled shoes and sent them to the logistics department. When they saw a nail falling on the ground, they immediately picked it up, straightened the bent ones, and used them again. At the end of the month, a statistics showed that they saved more than five catties. The old members put the wages from their previous processing work in the cooperative for turnover, and even if they had extremely difficult lives, they did not withdraw money from the cooperative. They also organized a factory protection picket team themselves. Some workers got up and put on their clothes at night when they heard dogs barking. Everyone was concerned about their own warehouse and the large number of leather shoes created by their labor, and the raw materials sent down from the joint cooperative. The workers' energy was all put into the cooperative.
　　Because of their active and hard work and gradual political progress, nine workers have been honorably accepted as members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Sun Shouyi and worker Hong Guimao were elected as the directors of the board of supervisors of the Shoe Industry Joint Cooperative, which leads the city's six shoe industry cooperatives, unifies the procurement of raw materials, and promotes the sale of finished products.
　　Flourishing
　　The League members proposed a production competition in January: frugality in labor and saving materials, and improving output. The workers responded and enthusiastically joined this movement. From January 15th to the present, they have made six hundred pairs of leather shoes, saving a total of one hundred and sixty feet of face leather, which can be used to make forty-four pairs of shoe uppers. They also saved one hundred catties of sole leather, which can be used to make forty pairs of soles. Output increased by nearly one-tenth. Costs were reduced by one-tenth. The quality of finished products has also improved. League members played a great role in the work.
　　There are now thirty-seven official members and twenty-five probationary members, a total of sixty-two people. Each person earns more than two hundred catties of millet per month, solving the livelihood problems of more than two hundred people. The former cooperative affairs committee has now been reorganized into a board of directors, and Sun Shouyi has been elected as the director. They have established a one-hour study system every day, determined the working hours to be nine hours per day, and formulated their own labor discipline, which is full of a new atmosphere.

### 太仆寺鞋业合作社在困难中成长起来

　　太仆寺鞋业合作社在困难中成长起来
    果筠·芦哲
    去年十一月间，京市二区鞋业工人失业的很多。工会办事处同志与鞋业失业工人孙守义曾多次与其他失业工人座谈组织合作社的问题。十一月底，由八个工人每人出十斤小米（共八十斤）作为基金，成立了太仆寺街鞋业合作社。
    合作社的房子由清管局帮助解决了，但家具和工具怎么办呢？经八个工人的努力和工会的帮助，东跑西借的借来了些零星家具和工具。冬天冷得厉害，又没有床。没有法子，老孙带头睡在地下。每天吃窝窝头，连碱菜都没有。就这还是邻居帮他们做的（因为他们无炉子）。更不好办的，是有两个工人常惦念着家里：啊！我家里遭灾荒，他们生活怎办呢？做起活来就懒散不起劲。老孙见到这种情形，便把自己的解雇费借给他们，捎回家去。由于这种真诚的阶级友爱的感召，他二人工作变得特别积极起来。就这样，七个工人紧紧团结在老孙的周围。
    大家动手克服困难
    合作社成立了一个社务委员会的机构，老孙当选为主任。一开始做加工活，做鞋帮，但没有缝纫机。老孙东跑西跑，但终归无效。工人们呢？也觉得这些事情应当领导上负责，自己管不着。于是停工停了五天。最后还是工人韩玉才提出：“我们应当大家办合作社，多向群众征求意见，一块研究讨论，困难就能克服。”老孙虚心接受，就和大家一块儿商量。在一次会上，工友洪贵茂说：“咱们做活不是先发的工资吗？大家把头个月的工资拿出来先买机器。”大家一致拥护，困难也就随着解决了。自此以后，工人们懂得了合作社要搞好，非大伙儿动手不可。积极地向组织上提意见，变成很普遍的现象了。
    青黄不接
    合作社日益发展，十天内就由八人发展到十五人。到十二月底共发展到三十五人。但新工人对合作社认识不够，他们认为合作社不过是几个人集股开的买卖吧了，态度是干一天活拿一天的钱。他们对社内公物不爱护，浪费原料。工会同志和老孙研究后，便利用“合作通讯”的实际材料来耐心地对工人们教育，说明合作社的性质等问题。并组织讨论，使社员初步认识到“合作社是我们自己的”。但这时又遇到一个极大的困难——旧活已做完，新活还未批下来。在这青黄不接的时候，停了十来天工。在这坚苦的十天中，部分积极工人和老社员们在支撑局面上起了很大作用。工人卢福瑞家里实在苦，老婆来找他；他怕支社里的钱会影响到合作社的前途，就忍痛卖掉自己的皮鞋，给老婆带回家维持生活。工人韩永琪把自己小褂卖去维持生活。社员们都没有离开合作社回家的想法。十天之内，差不多每天都是吃一顿饭。有时吃一点稀饭，半饥半饱的维持生活。工会工作同志果筠也拿自己的津贴费一万元借给工人弟兄们。这一连串爱护自己合作社的事实，更进一步的教育了还不懂得合作社性质的工人弟兄，使他们真正懂得合作社没有劳资关系，而是自己的。
    自觉节约
    度过“危险”期，艰苦的生活使工人们变了另一个样。譬如，国民党时期，私营商店里的鞋业工人四尺面皮子做不了一双靴子（因浪费），现在三尺八就够了。他们并开展了节约运动。见有闲着的灯马上就跑去灭掉。社员拉鞋送后勤部去。见掉在地下的钉马上拾起，弯的敲直了再用。到月底一统计省了五斤多。老社员把当初做加工活的工资放在社内周转，生活极困难也不向社内支钱。他们自己还组织了护厂纠察队。有的工人黑夜听到狗吠就赶忙披衣起床。每人都关心到自己的仓库和自己劳动所创造出来的大批皮鞋、从联合社发下来的原料。工人们的精力是全部放在合作社里了。
    因为工作上积极努力，政治上逐渐进步，目前已有九个工人光荣地被吸收为中国新民主主义青年团团员。孙守义和工人洪贵茂被选为鞋业联合社的理监事主任，这联合社领导全市六个鞋业合作社，统一采购原料并推销成品。
    蒸蒸日上
    团员们在一月份提出了生产竞赛：俭工省料，提高产量。工人响应并热烈投入这一运动。从一月十五日开始到现在，做了六百双皮鞋，共省下一百六十尺面皮，可做四十四双鞋面用。底皮也省下一百斤，可用做四十双鞋底。产量提高近十分之一。成本减低十分之一。成品质量也提高了。工作中，团员起了很大的作用。
    现在正式社员已有三十七人，预备社员也有二十五个共六十二人。每人每月挣二百多斤小米，解决了二百多人的生活问题。以前的社务委员会现已改选为理监事会，孙守义被选为主任。他们建立了每天一小时的学习制度，确定了工作时间为每天九小时，自己订出劳动纪律，充满了新的气象。
