Led by Party members and labor model Song Luoxue, farmers in Songjia Village, Mancheng, Hebei, are enthusiastically engaged in spring ploughing. The village's cotton fields have now been harrowed, ready for cotton planting. The village is one of the production base points in Mancheng County and a key cotton-growing village. After the provincial economic conference and the county people's congress, the Party branch formulated a plan to lead the masses in production, conducting extensive publicity and education among the masses. The masses understood the policies, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. They successively formulated family production plans. During the Spring Festival, farmers such as Song Fusheng began to deliver manure. More than forty of the village's sixty-two livestock were used to haul soil and deliver manure, breaking the farmers' long-standing custom of not working during the Spring Festival. During the hauling of soil and manure, Party members Song Lian and Song Baozhu worked together, hauling forty carts of soil in two and a half days. Seeing the benefits, fifty-odd livestock were quickly organized for mutual assistance. Before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, all the manure newly collected from the pens during the New Year was delivered to the fields, and more than 250 carts of manure and soil were hauled away for the six households of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers with no labor force. To preserve soil moisture and increase yields in wheat fields, more than 50 percent of the village's thirteen hectares of wheat land have been rolled, led by Party member Song Zhengcai. Many households also harrowed after rolling. The Party branch also issued a call: ensure that all wheat fields in the village are hoed at least once, and twice if there is rain. Two days before the Awakening of Insects, Party member Song Luohuan planted spring wheat, all of which had been soaked; he also helped three farmers soak their seeds. Female Party member Lan Feng also helped three farmers soak their seeds. Driven by the Party members, more than half of the fifty-odd mu of spring wheat land in Songjia Village, where there was no habit of soaking seeds, were soaked.

In the midst of the village's enthusiastic spring ploughing, on the fifteenth of this month, labor model Song Luoxue returned to the village from the North China Agricultural Technology Conference in Beijing. He first conveyed the spirit of the conference to the Party branch, and the Party branch immediately discussed and arranged preparations for cotton planting, afforestation, and the construction of drainage ditches. Currently, more than 90 percent of the village's planned one thousand mu of cotton fields (accounting for about 25 percent of the total land) have been rolled, and half of the households have harrowed after rolling. It will be harrowed again during sowing. Base fertilizer for the cotton fields was delivered earlier than in previous years, averaging more than four carts per mu, exceeding last year's figure by one and a half carts. To ensure increased cotton production, the village cadres also borrowed 18,000 jin of fine fertilizer from the bank, and many farmers also found ways to purchase it themselves. For example, Song Luotian and other ten households bought more than 1,000 jin of fine fertilizer. At the same time, the entire village will plant entirely 2:4:B cotton, and cotton seeds have been ordered from the farm. However, this batch of cotton seeds is not very pure, and the masses are somewhat dissatisfied. The Party branch decided that Party members should mobilize and explain to the masses and carry out selection. In addition, preparations for drought and flood prevention have been carried out. The whole village is preparing to dig four large wells, two of which are being organized by Party members Song Lian and Song Luotian. The bricks have been ordered and the waterwheels have been brought in. The work of converting small wells into large wells has also begun, and nineteen new waterwheels have been added, with seventeen households buying eight livestock together. The whole village is preparing to clear three hundred mu of drainage ditches, and Party member Li Jinrong has already adjusted his own drainage ditch. Influenced by Party member Song Luoxu planting thirty trees, the whole village has planted more than three hundred trees. (Wang Derui, Wang Shouqing, and Zhai Quanfu, Mancheng County Committee)

　　党员及劳动模范带头
    宋贾村掀起春耕热潮
    全村生产情绪好棉田碾耙完毕
    【本报讯】河北满城宋贾村农民，在中共支部与劳动模范宋洛学领导下，热烈春耕，现该村棉田碾耙完毕，作好植棉准备。该村是满城县生产基点村之一，也是种棉的重点村。从全省经济会议与县人代会后，中共支部即已作出领导群众生产的计划，对群众进行了广泛的宣传教育。群众了解了政策，生产情绪大为高涨，纷纷订出家庭生产计划。在春节期间就有农民宋福生等开始送粪。全村六十二头牲口，有四十多头进行拉土送粪，打破了农民多年来春节不做活的因习。拉土送粪中，党员宋连与宋宝柱合犋，两天半拉土四十车，群众看见了好处，五十来头牲口很快组织起来，进行互助。正月十五前，即把过年新从圈里起出的粪全送到地里，并把六户无劳力的烈、军、工属的二百五十多车粪、土拉清。为了使麦地保存水分，增加产量，党员宋正才带动下，全村十三顷多麦地，已有百分之五十以上碾过，有不少户碾过后还进行了耙擦。支部并提出号召：保证全村麦地普锄一遍，有雨水锄两遍。惊蛰前两天，党员宋洛欢就种了春麦，麦种都是浸过的；他还帮助三户农民浸种。妇女党员蓝凤也帮助三户农民浸种。在党员的带动下，从没有浸种习惯的宋贾村，五十多亩春麦地，有二分之一以上浸了种。
    在全村热烈春耕中，本月十五号，劳动模范宋洛学从北京开了华北农业技术会议回村，他首先向支部传达了会议精神，支部马上即讨论布置了种棉准备、造林与修泄水沟工作。现全村准备种的一千亩棉田（占总土地百分之二十五左右），已有百分之九十以上碾好，并有一半户在碾好后进行了耙擦。播种时再耙一遍即可。棉田肥早于旧年前送齐，每亩合四车多，超过去年一车半。为保证棉花增产，村干又向银行贷回细肥一万八千斤，很多农民自己也设法去购买，如宋洛田等十户又买细肥一千余斤。同时全村完全种二比斯字棉，已向农场订好棉籽。但这批棉籽不很纯，群众有些不满，支部决定党员向群众动员解释，进行挑拣。此外，又进行了防旱涝的准备，全村准备打大井四眼，党员宋连、宋洛田组织打的二眼，砖已订好，水车已拉来。小井改大井也已动工，并增加新水车十九辆，十七户伙买牲口八头。全村准备清理三百亩泄水沟，党员李金荣已把自己泄水沟调好。全村在党员宋洛絮栽树三十棵的影响下，已植树三百余棵。（满城县委会王德瑞、王守清、翟全福）
