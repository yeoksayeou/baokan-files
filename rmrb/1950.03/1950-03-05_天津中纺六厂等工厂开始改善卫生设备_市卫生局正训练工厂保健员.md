According to Tianjin Daily News: After the Factory Hygiene Inspection Group organized by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government and other departments conducted a key inspection of factory hygiene in Tianjin from February 9th to 16th, many factories and relevant agencies in Tianjin have begun to pay attention to and start improving factory hygiene facilities.

The No. 6 Textile Factory has formed a health and hygiene committee jointly by the administration, the trade union, and medical personnel; the families of the factory's dormitory staff have also formed a cleaning committee under the leadership of the trade union. Under the leadership of these two committees, five toilets have been rebuilt in the workers' dormitories and offices; old toilets that were unhygienic in the past have been demolished; more than 100 lidded spittoons have been added to the gauze workshops; the original iron water buckets have also been replaced with enamel buckets; and the water storage tanks are disinfected on a regular basis (currently once a month, with plans to change to once a week in summer). At the same time, the cleanliness of factories, dormitories, kitchens, canteens and other places were checked, and the shortcomings found in the inspection were pointed out through radio broadcasts and wall newspapers to carry out hygiene-related publicity and education. In addition, the factory clinic has begun diphtheria vaccination, spring smallpox vaccination, and pertussis vaccination. Nearly a thousand people have been vaccinated and inoculated. The factory's health and hygiene committee has also formulated a plan to rebuild two old toilets in the gauze workshops; build six wards, four large recreational homes for employees, and six nursery and kindergarten rooms; conduct a spring hygiene inspection and physical examinations for all employees and children; regularly disinfect toilets, garbage dumps, and garbage utensils; and draw up health knowledge posters to instill health knowledge in employees. The above work is scheduled to begin this month.

In order to eradicate the phenomenon of dust flying in the raw bristles manufacturing shares, the North China Bristle Company has ordered two wool beating machines from the Northeast, which are expected to be shipped to Tianjin in mid-month. After using this machine, dust and fluff can be removed before workers make raw bristles. The company has increased the number of spittoons to 270 and plans to increase it to 400; and has ordered a batch of lidded enamel water cups, ready to distribute one to each worker. A medical clinic is also being prepared and is actively recruiting doctors. In addition, the company has submitted a request for labor insurance funds in accordance with the regulations of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is planned to be used for employee labor insurance and welfare undertakings. However, the company's hygiene education for workers is not enough, and some workers still do not pay attention to hygiene, such as not spitting into spittoons, and spittoons are not washed on time; toilet paper is discarded randomly in the toilets, causing blockages in the water pipes, etc. These still need to be improved.

In order to assist in improving factory hygiene work, the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau opened a factory health worker training class on February 27. A total of 14 trainees are participating (some are sent by various factories for training; some are recruited medical personnel with more than three years of work experience, who have been agreed to be assigned to various factories after graduation). The training period is tentatively set for one month. The courses include factory infectious diseases, occupational disease prevention, health examination methods, factory health education, and environmental hygiene. After the health workers complete their training and are recommended to various factories, they will still be led by the Health Bureau in their work. Their responsibilities are to cooperate with the medical institutions of each factory to carry out factory health education and design to improve environmental hygiene. The bureau plans to conduct hygiene work in several large factories of different natures first through the holding of this training class in order to gain experience and promote it throughout the city.

The Eleventh Health Clinic of Tianjin also launched factory hygiene work in late February. It first contacted the Labor Insurance Department of the Trade Union of the North China Machinery Company Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and has now begun to conduct health checks for all employees in cooperation with the plant's doctors. It will also hold factory hygiene lectures and inspections of factory environmental hygiene on a regular basis.

　  天津中纺六厂等工厂开始改善卫生设备
    市卫生局正训练工厂保健员
    【本报讯】据天津日报消息：自中央人民政府劳动部等部门所组之工厂卫生检查组于二月九日至十六日在天津进行重点检查工厂卫生后，津市不少工厂和有关机关已开始重视并着手改善工厂卫生设备。
    中纺六厂已由行政、工会与医务人员联合组成保健卫生委员会；该厂职工宿舍的家属亦在工会领导下成立了清洁委员会。在该两委员会的领导下，首先在工人宿舍和办公室等处改建了厕所五所；拆除了以往不合卫生的旧厕所；纱布场内添置了带盖的痰桶一百余个；原来铁制的饮水桶也改用了洋瓷桶；储水池按期施行消毒（现在每月一次，计划夏季改为每周一次）。同时检查了工厂、宿舍、厨房、食堂等处的清洁情形，并利用广播和壁报指出检查中发现的缺点，进行有关卫生的宣传与教育。此外，该厂医务室已开始白喉预防注射、春季种痘和百日咳预防注射。目前已注射和种痘者近千人。该厂保健卫生委员会并已拟订计划：改建纱布场两处旧厕所；建筑病房六间、职工业余休养所四大间及托幼院房舍六间；举行春季卫生大检查及全体职工儿童的体格检查；厕所、垃圾场和垃圾用具进行定期消毒；绘制卫生常识挂图，以灌输职工卫生常识。上述工作定本月份即开始办理。
    华北猪鬃公司为根绝生鬃制造股内尘土飞扬现象，已在东北订购了两架打毛机，本月中旬可运津。使用此机后，能在工人做生鬃前先将尘土和绒毛打净。该公司已将痰桶添至二百七十个，拟再增至四百个；并订购了一批带盖搪瓷水杯，准备发给每个工人一个。医疗所亦准备成立，正积极聘请医师。此外，该公司已按中华全国总工会规定提出劳保基金等用款，计划用以举办职工劳保福利事业。但该公司对工人进行卫生教育尚不够，部分工人仍不注意卫生，如不向痰桶吐痰，痰桶不按时倒洗；上厕所乱丢手纸，以致堵塞水管等。这些尚待继续改进。
    天津市卫生局为协助改善工厂卫生工作，于二月二十七日开办了工厂卫生保健员训练班。受训学员共十四人（一部分为各工厂送往受训的；一部分为招考的有三年以上工作经验的医务人员，已洽妥于毕业后分派至各厂工作）。训练期暂定一月。课程包括工厂传染病、职业病预防、健康检查法、工厂卫生教育及环境卫生等。保健员受训完毕分荐到各厂后，在业务上仍受卫生局领导，其职责为配合各该厂的医疗机构，进行工厂卫生教育及设计改善环境卫生等工作。该局拟通过此次训练班的举办，先办理几个性质不同的大的工厂的卫生工作，以吸取经验，推及全市。
    津市第十一卫生事务所亦于二月下旬起展开工厂卫生工作。首与华北机器公司汽车制配厂工会劳保部取得联系，现已与该厂医师合作开始进行全体职工的健康检查。并将按期举行工厂卫生讲座和视查工厂环境卫生等。
