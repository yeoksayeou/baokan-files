　　The March 16th report stated that the retail price of tap water in Beijing is 60 yuan per dan, but many retail locations (such as the east entrance of Wuliang Daren Hutong) are selling it for 150 yuan. What is the reason for this? (Water Consumer)

　　For more than a month, due to the Construction Bureau's road repairs at the east entrance of Dajue Hutong in Beigouyan, Xicheng, water has been taken from a water pipe without a water meter by attaching a rubber hose. The water vendor is using this rubber hose to sell water, causing significant losses to the state. Moreover, this water station has recently raised prices twice: at the end of the lunar year, 100 yuan could buy two dan (four buckets) of water, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, 100 yuan could buy three buckets of water, and now it is two buckets. Please investigate these issues and provide a detailed response.

　　Regarding the matter of retail water vendor Li Peizhang at the east entrance of Dajue Hutong selling water above the regulated price, illegally selling water using the water source for road repairs, and the matter of Chen Zhizhong, the water seller at the east entrance of Wuliang Daren Hutong, charging 150 yuan per dan, investigations have confirmed these facts. The two water vendors have admitted their mistakes and have been educated. We will send people to various locations to inspect and correct these issues at any time in the future.

　　两处不按规定价格售水  自来水公司已调查处理
    来信
    三月十六日报载京市自来水零售价每担六十元，但许多零售处（如无量大人胡同东口）却售一百五十元，不解何故？（吃水人）
    西城北沟沿大觉胡同东口，最近一个多月来因建设局翻修马路，在不走水表的水管上装一橡皮管取水用。而售水夫则利用这个橡皮管卖水，使国家损失很大。而且，最近该水站连续涨价二次：农历年底每百元可购水两担（四桶），正月初五为每百元购水三桶，现在则是两桶。以上问题请自来水公司调查并详为答复。

    答复
    关于大觉胡同东口零售水夫李佩璋不按规定价格售水事，并利用修路放水处不法售水及无量大人胡同东口售水人陈致中每担索价一百五十元事，均经派人调查属实。现该两处售水夫除已承认错误并分别给予教育外，我们今后将随时派人到各处检查纠正。
