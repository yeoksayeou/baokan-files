　　Severe Disaster Areas of Ninghe and Baodi in Hebei Province:
    Rush Planting Spring Wheat to Shorten Famine Time;
    Masses Carrying Lanterns at Night to Plant with Extremely High Morale
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: In the six districts of the severely affected areas of Ninghe and Baodi counties, Hebei Province, a surge of rush planting of spring wheat has been launched after various grains were loaned. As of the statistics on March 2nd, the six districts have sown 60,399 mu of spring wheat, accounting for about one-half of the total planned wheat planting area. Due to the warming weather in the severely affected areas of the two counties, the land near water is muddy and cannot be sown during the day. In order not to miss the season, the first and seventh districts of Baodi are rushing to plant at night with lanterns. For example, in Xinzhuangzi Village in the seventh district, the entire village can plant 1,000 mu. Under the leadership of party members and cadres Zhao Tingshan and Liu Jiwang, the entire village launched nighttime wheat planting, planting 200 mu in three nights. Under the influence of this village, 20 villages have launched a nighttime wheat planting upsurge. As of the statistics on the 3rd, 30 percent of the wheat land in the district that should be planted has been sown. In terms of solving the problem of seeds, the seventh district also fully mobilized the masses to prepare or borrow seeds themselves. However, those who are truly unable to solve the problem will be loaned seeds or exchange wheat seeds from the loaned grain in a coarse-to-fine grain swap, in order to overcome the masses' simplistic view of relying on the government. The masses who can solve their own seed difficulties account for about 40 percent. This year, due to the difficult living conditions of the disaster victims in the severely affected areas of the two counties, most of the livestock have been sold, resulting in insufficient animal power. In order to overcome the difficulty of animal power, the local government vigorously called on the masses to cooperate and help each other, with people pulling plows, both men and women going to the fields together. They also educated the masses to ensure that the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers are able to plant wheat. At the same time, they also educated the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers to actively participate in wheat planting in order to reduce the area of substitute cultivation. According to statistics from the seventh district, more than 60 percent of the population has participated in labor during the rush planting period. Most of the masses can freely form groups, such as in Yazi Village, where there are 85 male and female laborers, 18 women are participating in pulling plows, and 25 women are going to the fields to deliver and spread manure. Most of the male and female laborers in the villages of martyrs, soldiers, and workers are also participating in mutual aid groups to rush plant spring wheat.

　　河北宁河宝坻两重灾区
    抢种春麦缩短灾荒时间
    群众黑夜提灯赶种情绪极高
    【本报讯】记者康维中报道：河北省宁河、宝坻两县重灾区六个区，在贷放各种粮食后，已掀起抢种春麦热潮。截至三月二日的统计，六个区已播种春麦六万零三百九十九亩，占全部计划种麦数的二分之一左右。两县重灾区由于天气渐暖，近水地翻浆，白天不能播种，为了不误季节，宝坻一、七区就在夜间提灯笼赶种。如七区辛庄子，全村能种一千亩，在该村党员、干部赵廷山和刘继旺的带领下，全村展开夜间种麦，三夜即种二百亩。在该村的影响下，二十个村已经展开夜间种麦的热潮。截至三日的统计，该区应种麦地的百分之三十已播种完毕。七区在解决种籽方面，亦充分发动群众自备或借贷，但群众确实无力解决者，再行贷种或从以粗换细的贷粮中换取麦种，以克服群众单纯依赖政府的观点。群众自己能解决种子困难者，达百分之四十左右。今年两县重灾区灾民，因生活困难，牲口大部出卖，造成畜力之不足。为克服畜力困难，当地政府大力号召群众插伙互助，人拉耠子，男女齐下地。并教育群众保证给烈、军、工属种上麦子。同时也教育烈、军、工属积极参加种麦，以缩小代耕面积。据七区统计：在抢种期中，百分之六十以上的人口已参加劳动。大部群众都能自由结组，如鸭子庄男女劳动力八十五个，有十八个妇女参加拉耠子，二十五个妇女上地送粪和撒粪。各村烈、军、工属男女劳动力，也大部参加互助组，抢种春麦。
