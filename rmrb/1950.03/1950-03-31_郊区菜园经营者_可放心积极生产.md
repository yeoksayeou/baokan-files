　　Suburban Vegetable Garden Operators Can Confidently and Actively Produce

　　At present, land reform has ended in most of the rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing, and the production season has begun. However, some farmers who grow "vegetable gardens" are afraid to vigorously produce because they do not understand the policies. If this phenomenon continues, it will inevitably affect the production of vegetables, and it will inevitably affect the supply of vegetables to the city in the future. This issue has become an urgent problem that cannot be delayed.

　　"Vegetable gardens" are places that produce vegetables and supply them to the city. They are scattered in various suburban areas. Growing vegetables requires skill, so it is called "horticulture." There is a saying, "One mu of garden is equal to three mu of field," meaning that the output of each mu of garden land can withstand the output of three mu of ordinary dry land. But if the vegetable growing technology is not good, the income will be about the same as ordinary land.

　　Vegetable gardens generally need to hire some people to work together in a garden. It is generally not enough to rely solely on the labor of the "garden owner" (the actual owner of the garden land or the farmer who grows the garden land) (at most, each farmer who grows the garden land can only cultivate about five mu of garden land).

　　If this farmer who grows garden land has thirty mu of garden land, and there is only him alone to work, then if he wants to produce the output of thirty mu of garden land, he must hire a few people to cultivate it, otherwise, it is impossible.

　　Now the ideological concerns of the farmers in some vegetable gardens lie in the issue of hiring people. Therefore, they dare not let go and boldly and actively produce, but instead produce passively in a small way.

　　Their questions are:
　　"Should we hire people or not?"
　　"Will hiring someone cause us a lot of trouble?"
　　"Will our class status suddenly be raised because we hired someone, resulting in another class division?"
　　"Should we do it or not?" "Should we buy manure or not?"
　　"Who knows what will happen!"
　　"Let's just change it to dry land! Who cares what happens!"

　　These ideological concerns have become a common phenomenon. Many people's final decisions are:

　　"Don't hire anyone!"
　　"Let's just muddle through on our own!"
　　"Plant a few mu of dry land and be done with it! It's easier!"

　　As a result, their production enthusiasm is negative and low. They are unwilling to boldly produce, do not buy manure, and are not as busy with production as in previous years, nor do they look for seeds or buy seeds to prepare for production, but just passively wait: "Plant some dry land and be done with it." In this way, the future results will inevitably affect the lives of a considerable number of people. This will cause workers who used to work in the gardens to lose their jobs, which is a considerable number of people. Some vegetable vendors will also become impoverished. The manure industry will also suffer losses. More importantly, the supply of vegetables to the city will be felt to be lacking and become a problem. The large number of garden lands converted to dry land will also affect the income of the national treasury. The result will be an unnecessary loss.

　　It is hoped that this will attract the attention of comrades working in the suburbs, and that the government will pay attention to this work, and make a clear stipulation on the issue of hiring people for production and their class status after hiring, point out the purpose and direction of their production, encourage them to confidently and boldly produce actively, dispel some of their ideological concerns, stabilize their production enthusiasm, and further increase their production enthusiasm and increase production. (Wu Yuling)

　　Answer: The State Council's instructions on handling the issue of agricultural land in the suburbs of old liberated areas, issued on January 13 this year, have clearly stipulated that vegetable gardens, regardless of whether their ownership has changed, shall continue to be used by the original operators. Therefore, those who grow vegetable gardens do not need to worry about the issue of class status. After the land reform, the government allows hiring labor due to the needs of cultivation. As for fearing that hiring labor will "cause trouble" and fearing the occurrence of similar labor-capital disputes, the government has paid attention to this issue and will solve it by means of contracts signed by both parties. Cadres have been dispatched to carry this out, and those who operate vegetable gardens do not need to worry too much about this either. Operate the vegetable gardens well, and the government will definitely protect the benefits they deserve. (Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government)

### 郊区菜园经营者  可放心积极生产

　　郊区菜园经营者  可放心积极生产
    目前北京市郊区的大部农村已经结束了土地改革，生产季节已经开始。但部分种“菜园子”的农民，因不明政策，还不敢大力生产。这现象如果延长下去，就必然会影响菜蔬的生产，也就必然影响将来城市蔬菜的供应。这个问题，已成为急待解决不容迟缓的问题。
    “菜园子”是生产蔬菜与供应城市蔬菜的地方，他们散布在城郊各区。种菜是需要技术的，因此被称为“园艺”。有“一亩园、三亩田”的话，也就是说种园子的每一亩地的出产能顶住平常旱地三亩的出产。但如果种菜技术不行。收入也会如平常地差不多。
    菜园子一般需要雇一些人，同在一块园地里劳动生产。只依“园主”（种园子地的本主或种园子地的农民）自己的劳动一般是不够的（最多每个种园地的农民只能耕种园地五亩的样子）。
    假如这个种园地的农民有园地三十亩，家里只有他一人劳动，那他要打算生产三十亩园子地的生产量，就必须雇几个人来耕种，否则，是不可能的。
    现在一些菜园子里的农民的思想顾虑就在雇人问题上。他们因此不敢放手大胆的积极生产，而是小手小脚的消极生产。
    他们的疑问是：
    “是雇人不雇人呢？”
    “雇个人是否要跟咱找好多麻烦呢？”
    “是不是因为咱雇了人，而另来一次划阶级，把咱一下子提高了成份呢？”
    “干不干呢？”“买粪不买粪呢？”
    “还不定怎么回事哩！”
    “干脆！改成旱地算了，管他怎么着哩！”
    这些思想顾虑，目前成了一种普遍的现象。许多人最后的决定是：
    “不雇人啦！”
    “自个儿凑合着瞎弄吧！”
    “种几亩旱地完了，又省事！”
    这么一来，他们的生产情绪消极而低落，不愿大胆的去生产，不买粪，也不像往年一样的忙着生产，亦不找子种、买种子张罗着生产，而只是消极的等着：“种点旱地完了。”这样，将来的结果，必然会影响着不少的一部分人的生活。这要使得往年给园子里干活的工人失业，这是一批不少的人。一些卖菜的小贩们也将走向贫困。粪业亦会受到损失。更重要的，对城市的蔬菜供应也会感到缺乏而成问题。随之而产生的大批园地改种了旱地，也将关系着国库的收入。结果会造成一个不应有的损失的。
    希望能引起郊区工作同志的注意，希望政府对这一工作加以注意，对其雇人生产及雇人后的成份问题有一明确的规定，指出其生产的目的方向，鼓励其放心大胆积极的生产，解除他们某些思想顾虑，安定其生产情绪，进而提高其生产情绪，增大生产。（吴毓龄）
    答：今年一月十三日政务院关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示已经明白确定，菜园不论其所有权有无变动，一律仍由原经营者继续使用。所以种菜园子的大不必为成份问题有所顾虑。经过土地改革以后，由于耕作上的需要，政府是允许雇工的。至于怕雇工“找麻烦”，怕发生类似劳资纠纷的事件；政府对这问题已加注意，将用双方订立合同的办法来解决，已派干部在进行中，经营菜园子的对这也不必过多顾虑。好好经营菜园子，政府一定保障他应得的利益。（北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会）
