　　Save on Expenses, Increase Revenue!
    Northeast Shenyang Railway Administration Strictly
    Audits Planned Annual Savings of Over 200 Billion Yuan for Various Units
    [Report from this newspaper] The Northeast Railway Bureau is rigorously implementing the Central Committee's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work." Based on the principle of saving expenditures, it is re-auditing the 1950 production and financial plans of various administrations. As of the 13th, the budget of the Shenyang Administration has been audited. According to preliminary statistics, the administration's transportation tasks have increased by 35 percent compared to the original plan (calculated by ton-kilometers extended, or 15.5 percent based on the number of loaded cars), while expenditures can be reduced by more than 200 billion yuan (Northeast currency). Personnel will be managed according to the General Bureau's staffing quotas, and the currently surplus 1,683 personnel will await dispatch by the General Bureau.
    The reasons for the smooth progress of this work are: Firstly, everyone carefully studied the Central Committee's decision on unifying financial and economic work and listened to the report of the General Bureau's director, thus recognizing ideologically that tightening expenditures is a serious political task at present. Secondly, the original plan was reviewed again with a pragmatic attitude and the principle of distinguishing between priorities and urgency. As a result, many unrealistic issues were discovered: for example, some projects, although necessary, could not be realized this year due to certain limitations, but they were still included in the plan. There were also tasks that could be postponed. Even due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation on the ground, inaccurate estimates were made based on general average standards. After the corrections, significant savings were achieved. Thirdly, the responsible comrades of the Shenyang Administration demonstrated a high degree of responsibility in the audit work and proactively proposed many suggestions for reducing expenditures. For example, the General Bureau originally planned to build 24 new cargo warehouses, which have now been reduced to 15, but the Shenyang Bureau independently proposed that five would be sufficient. For the construction of fences, gatehouses, and small buildings, the Shenyang Bureau proposed to use waste materials (such as bark) as much as possible to reduce expenditures. For another example, the semi-automatic signals from Siping to Tieling, due to the unpredictable import time of foreign materials, were proposed to be collected from waste materials and supplemented as necessary, and renovated into automatic signals on their own, but the budget was not increased. The Shenyang Bureau's attitude of being responsible for national finance should be commended. The planning units of the General Bureau also did their best to put forward amendments to the original plan based on the Central Committee's financial policy. Following the Shenyang Bureau, the budgets of the Jinzhou Bureau and other bureaus will be audited successively. It is hoped that under the promotion of this audit, we can more strictly control the budget in our actual work in 1950, in order to further reduce expenditures and complete our tasks.

### 节约支出，增加收入！  东北沈阳铁路管理局严格  审核各单位计划年省开支二千余亿元

　　节约支出，增加收入！
    东北沈阳铁路管理局严格
    审核各单位计划年省开支二千余亿元
    【本报讯】东北铁路总局厉行中央“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，根据节约支出的原则，重新严格审核各管理局一九五○年度生产财务计划。截至十三日止，沈阳管理局之预算已审核完毕，据初步统计：该局运输任务较原定按延吨公里计算增加百分之三十五（按装车量计算增加百分之十五·五），而开支可减少二千余亿元（东北币），人员则按总局之定员数目执行，并将目前编余之一六八三人听候总局调遣。
    这一工作顺利进行的原因：首先是由于大家认真的研究了中央关于统一财经工作的决定，并听取了总局局长的报告，从思想上认识了紧缩开支是当前的严重政治任务。其次，以实事求是的态度，分清轻重缓急的原则，重新审查原计划的结果，发现其中有许多不切合实际的问题：例如有的工程虽属必要，但由于某些条件的限制，在今年根本不能实现，结果也列入了计划。还有的是可以缓办的任务。甚至因不了解现场实情，按一般的平均标准作了不确实的估计。经过修正后，节省很大的开支。第三，沈阳管理局负责同志在审核工作中，表现了高度的负责态度，主动提出许多缩减开支的意见。例如：货物仓库，总局原计划新建二十四处现已减为十五处，沈阳局却自行提出有五处即够。栅栏、门卫、小房等建筑，沈阳局提出尽量利用废料（板皮等）以减少支出。又如四平至铁岭的半自动信号，因国外材料的进口时期不能预计，而提出搜集废料加以必要的补充，自行装修为自动信号，但预算并未增加。沈阳局此种对国家财政负责的态度，应当表扬。总局各计划单位也根据中央的财政方针，尽力提出了对原计划的修正意见。继沈阳局以后将陆续审核锦州局及其他各局之预算，希望能在此次审核的推动下，使我们在一九五○年的实际工作中更能严格掌握预算，以求再为减少开支而完成任务。
