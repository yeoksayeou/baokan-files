    [This newspaper reports] In order to meet the needs of the masses, the Beijing Retail Company has established its second store outside Gugu Temple on Andingmen Main Street, retailing white cloth, colored cloth, striped cloth, and daily necessities. Since its opening on March 4th, it has been deeply supported by the masses. There are many farmer users in the northern suburbs. According to the masses, the prices of cloth and department stores in the retail company are fair, and the quality is also solid. There are no problems with private merchants exchanging fakes for real goods, or using inferior goods to top high-quality goods.

    东北砂糖二十四万斤将进关
    【本报讯】北京市零售公司为了供应群众需要，特于安定门大街姑姑寺口外，设立第二门市部，零售白布、色布、条布及日用百货。自从三月四日开幕以来，深受群众拥护。北郊农民用户颇多。据群众反映：零售公司的布和百货，价格既公道，品质也实在，没有私商的以假换真，以次货顶高货的毛病。
