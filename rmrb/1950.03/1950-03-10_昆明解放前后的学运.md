　　The Student Movement Before and After the Liberation of Kunming
    Jin Feng
    The student movement before and after the liberation of Kunming, in this last major city liberated on mainland China, wrote a brilliant page in the history of the Chinese student movement with its incredibly rich content and heroic struggles. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party—the Yunnan Democratic Youth League, a fighting organization of the youth students themselves—the students of Kunming went from the schools to the factories, the countryside, and the army. They tempered themselves in the process of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them directly participated in the armed struggle in the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi border area; others persisted in the urban struggle. They cooperated with the people of all walks of life in Kunming to smash the invasion of the last remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, completely defended Kunming, and welcomed the takeover by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government.
            (1) Striving for Local Peace
    In May, June, July, and August of 1949, when the students in Beijing were happily and freely studying revolutionary theory, and the students in Shanghai were dancing the Yangko in the streets to celebrate liberation, the students in Kunming were still secretly printing "On New Democracy," and running around in factories, shops, rural areas, and the homes of citizens, carrying out propaganda and mobilization work. They united with people from all walks of life to launch a movement to strive for local peace.
    Hundreds and thousands of students scattered into the countryside, helping farmers to harvest rice and tread waterwheels. They told them the principles of suffering and standing up, telling them that the poor people of the world are one family, that the Communist Party leads the poor to stand up, and that the peasants in the old liberated areas of Northeast and North China are dividing land and livestock and living a good life. The students went to the factories, helping the workers to carry out the struggle to improve their lives, writing slogans and leaflets for the workers, and encouraging them to participate in political actions to strive for local peace. The students visited the army and the police, propagating to them the heroism and glory of the people's armed forces—the People's Liberation Army—under the leadership of the Communist Party, and explaining to them the Communist Party's policy towards officers and soldiers who revolted. The students also visited industrialists, businessmen, professors, and housewives, introducing them to "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and "On the Liberated Area Battlefield." Through these propaganda and mobilization efforts, people from all walks of life began to organize; various organizations were established, such as the New Democratic Workers' League, the Yunnan New Democratic League, the Yunnan New Democratic Local Construction Association, and the Yunnan New Democratic Women's Association, including more than 3,000 advanced people from all walks of life in Kunming.
    The movement to strive for local peace quickly received the response of the people from all walks of life in Kunming. Fifty to sixty newspapers and periodicals publicly published Xinhua News Agency dispatches and Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Students and workers gave public speeches, demanding local peace in Kunming. Industrialists, businessmen, and local gentry also called for "opposing the entry of Kuomintang defeated troops into Yunnan." Elementary school students sang "Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive" grandly in the streets, and college students performed living dramas to denounce Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren's treasonous conspiracies. When the movement of the people of all walks of life in Kunming to strive for a local peaceful solution was spreading like the melting of snow in the spring sun and the rushing of hundreds of rivers, Chiang Kai-shek personally flew to Chongqing and sent anti-Communist secret agent pseudo-legislators Tao Yong and Luo Heng to Kunming to bitterly lament "the mournful sound of national subjugation" in order to stimulate the "patriotic enthusiasm" of the people of Kunming, but they were unceremoniously rebuked by the people of Kunming. The people of Kunming unceremoniously froze all the gold and silver of the Kunming branch of the pseudo-Central Bank, thereby revealing their true patriotic enthusiasm.
    In such a mass political movement, the students launched and organized a large-scale "going down to the countryside" movement of 3,000 people (about 10,000 Kunming students went down to the countryside successively), directly participating in the armed struggle in the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi border area.
            (2) Armed Struggle
    The students who went down to the countryside with many shortcomings and heavy burdens, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in the actual struggle, quickly underwent transformation and played a certain role in the revolution. Many students served as detachment commanders, political commissars, regimental commanders, and battalion commanders of the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Column, directly commanding armed struggle. More students were responsible for the party and government work at the district, county, city, and prefectural levels of the base areas. The transformed students had many heroic and unyielding behaviors in battle. The deeds of the female student Shi Peiying are the most widely circulated. She was a Communist Party member, changed her name to Sun Lanying, and was sent to work among the masses in the countryside of Yimen County, Dianzhong, and was deeply loved by the local peasants. Unfortunately, she was arrested. The enemy used various cruel tortures, such as burning her chest with red-hot branding irons and piercing her fingernails with sharpened bamboo needles, to force her to confess! She always insisted on not yielding. When she finally died heroically, she shouted "Long live the liberation of the people of Yunnan," "Long live the liberation of the Chinese people," and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" The local peasants automatically renamed the township where she worked Lanying Township and erected a stone tablet to commemorate her.
            (3) The Defense of Kunming
    The Kunming people's movement to strive for peace finally had results. On December 9, 1949, General Lu Han revolted, and Kunming declared peaceful liberation. However, at that time, the People's Liberation Army had not yet arrived in Yunnan Province. The Kuomintang remnant bandit army, the Twenty-sixth Army and the Eighth Army, a total of 30,000 people, under the bait of "three days of free action" (that is, looting, raping, and killing) after allowing the soldiers to occupy Kunming, invaded Kunming in full force on December 18, surrounding the east and south of Kunming city. The Kuomintang reactionaries also sent planes to bomb and help the battle every day. The students of Kunming and people from all walks of life calmly carried out the defense war together.
    Three thousand students were concentrated in Yunnan University, waiting to be assigned to any work to support the defense war. Some, braving the danger of artillery fire, took comfort goods to the front line to comfort the army. They sang and danced, striving to encourage the defense corps and the police to bravely kill the enemy and make meritorious service, and striving to become glorious People's Liberation Army soldiers. Some went to repair the gaps in the city walls, build fortifications and bunkers. Medical students participated in the rescue team and worked with doctors and nurses. When a place was bombed, they immediately rushed there to carry out rescue work and help clean up the streets. Other professors and students scattered in the schools organized to protect the school and prevent special agents from taking the opportunity to sabotage. Teachers, students, and staff scattered in their homes participated in the citywide citizens' night watch. A part of the students directly participated in the volunteer self-defense team to maintain public order, taking charge of political work.
    In line with the law of the development of the student movement, when the people of all walks of life in Kunming were awakened and organized under the influence of the Kunming student movement, the Kunming student movement melted into the mass movement, which was far larger and more profound in scale and influence than the student movement. This was even clearer in the defense of Kunming. At that time, the broad masses of the people in Kunming, especially the workers and peasants, had a high degree of political consciousness and were prepared to resist the Chiang bandits' remnant army firmly and unyieldingly, and the rumors about the bandits' "three days of freedom" further prompted the people of all walks of life in Kunming, including the industrial and commercial circles, public and educational personnel, and local armed forces, to unite closely and play their respective roles in the Kunming defense war from December 18 to 22. Workers, peasants, and citizens first organized a 3,000-strong "volunteer self-defense team" to maintain public order in the city, replacing the police who went to the front line. Citizens organized to build fortifications for night watch, doctors and nurses participated in rescue work, and people from industrial, commercial, and financial circles raised a large amount of comfort goods. The workers fully demonstrated the fearless spirit of the proletariat in the defense war. The workers of the Yunnan Spinning Mill and Yudian Spinning Mill, which were located on the front line, moved all the stored cotton out within an hour to build fortifications. Many male workers went directly to the front line to participate in the battle or joined the volunteer guards to maintain public order. Female workers stayed in the factory to protect the factory. They took rifles and short guns and pounced on the walls to help fight the enemy. Under the encouragement of the self-defense emotions of the people of all walks of life in Kunming to protect their lives and property from the destruction and devastation of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, the defense corps and the police fought very bravely. When fifty bandits broke into Jiaoshan Bridge, the guarding police had poor guns and little ammunition. In such a critical situation, they caught the bandits' unexploded grenades and threw them back, killing the bandits, and they all sacrificed themselves. The Twelfth Regiment of the Defense Corps, guarding Nanyao (only one or two li away from the city), blocked three times as many bandits armed with the latest American weapons. The entire regiment suffered nearly one-third of casualties but still held the position.
    Under the stubborn and united resistance of the Kunming people, and in coordination with the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Column's interception of the rear, the Kuomintang bandits' army invading Kunming finally collapsed on December 22.
            (4) Welcoming Liberation
    After the defense of Kunming, the students of Kunming, like all students in the early days of liberation, openly, happily, and conscientiously studied revolutionary knowledge, and at the same time helped to eliminate special agents, maintain revolutionary order, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army together with the people from all walks of life.
    In such a tense fighting period before and after liberation, the students of Kunming always united the teachers and the school authorities well and persisted in attending classes (except for a few days of suspension during the defense war), thus creating many favorable conditions for their work. When the People's Liberation Army entered Kunming in mid-February 1950, the students of Kunming finally had a winter vacation and joyfully welcomed the People's Liberation Army.
    But they realized that this was only the beginning of learning with a more tenacious fighting spirit!

　　昆明解放前后的学运
    金凤
    昆明解放前后的学运，在中国大陆上最后解放的这个大城市中，以其无比丰富的内容与英勇斗争的事迹，在中国学运史中写下了光彩的一页。昆明学生在中共领导—青年学生自己的战斗组织的—云南民主青年同盟的领导下，他们从学校走向工厂、农村和部队。在与工农兵结合的过程中锻炼着自己。他们有一部分直接参加了滇桂黔边区的武装斗争；另一部分坚持着城市斗争。他们配合昆明各界人民，粉碎了国民党反动派最后残余军队的进犯，完整地保卫了昆明，迎接了人民解放军和人民政府的接管。
            （一）争取局部和平
    在一九四九年五、六、七、八月中，当北京的学生已在幸福地自由地学习着革命理论，上海学生在街头欢扭秧歌庆祝解放的时候，昆明学生还在偷偷地印刷着“新民主主义论”，奔走在工厂、商店、农村和市民的住宅中，进行宣传和鼓动工作。他们结合着社会各阶层人民，展开了争取局部和平的运动。
    学生们成百成千地散布到农村中，帮助农民割稻、车水。跟他们讲受苦翻身的道理，跟他们讲天下穷人是一家，共产党领导穷人翻身，东北、华北老解放区农民分土地、分牲口，过好日子的光景。学生们到工厂中，帮助工人进行争取改善生活的斗争，为工人写标语、传单，鼓励工人参加争取局部和平的政治行动。学生们访问军队、警察，向他们宣传共产党领导下的人民武装——人民解放军的英勇和光荣，向他们说明共产党对于起义官兵的政策。学生们又访问工商业者、教授和家庭妇女，介绍他们看“新民主主义论”、“论联合政府”、“论解放区战场”等。经过这些宣传、鼓动的工作，各阶层人民开始组织起来；成立了新民主主义工人同盟、云南新民主主义者联盟、云南新民主主义地方建设协会、云南新民主主义妇女协会等各种组织，包括了昆明各阶层先进人士三千余人。
    争取局部和平运动很快的得到了昆明各界人民的响应。五六十家报刊公开发表着新华社电讯，毛主席的“论人民民主专政”。学生、工人公开演讲，要求昆明局部和平。工商界人士和当地士绅也叫着“反对国民党溃军入滇”。小学生们在街上堂皇地唱着“活捉蒋介石”，大学生演活报痛斥蒋介石李宗仁的卖国阴谋。当昆明各界人民争取局部和平解决的运动已如春阳化雪，百川奔流地泼散开来时，蒋介石亲自飞到重庆，派了反共特务伪立委陶镛和罗衡到昆明来痛陈“亡国哀音”以激发昆明人民的“爱国热忱”，结果被昆明人民不客气地痛斥了回去。昆明人民并不客气地冻结了伪中央银行昆明分行的全部黄金白银，他们以此显露了他们真正的爱国热忱。
    在这样的群众性的政治运动中，学生又发动组织了一次三千人的大下乡（昆明学生先后下乡的约有一万人），直接参加滇桂黔边区的武装斗争。
            （二）武装斗争
    带着满身缺点和重重包袱下乡的学生，在中共的领导下和实际的斗争中，迅速获得改造，并在革命中起了一定的作用，不少的学生当着滇桂黔纵队的支队司令员、政委、团长和大队长，直接指挥着武装斗争。更有不少的学生负责根据地的区、县、市、地各级的党政工作。改造了的学生在战斗中有着许多英勇不屈的行为，女学生施佩瑛的事迹是流传得最广的一个。她是一个共产党员，改名叫孙兰英，被派到滇中易门县乡下做群众工作，极获得当地农民的爱戴。但不幸被捕，敌人以烧红的烙铁烫她的胸部和削尖的竹针刺进她的指甲等种种酷刑来逼她的口供！她始终坚持不屈，最后就义的时候高呼“云南人民解放万岁”，“中国人民解放万岁”和“中国共产党万岁”！当地农民自动将她所在工作的那个乡改名兰英乡，并立了石碑来纪念她。
            （三）昆明保卫战
    昆明人民争取和平的运动终于有了结果，一九四九年十二月九日卢汉将军起义，昆明宣告和平解放，但当时解放军还没有到达云南境内，国民党残余匪军第二十六军和第八军两部共三万人，在允许兵士攻占昆明后可“自由行动三天”（就是抢掠奸淫烧杀）的钓饵之下，十二月十八日倾巢进犯昆明，包围了昆明的城东和城南。国民党反动派并派了飞机每天轰炸助战。昆明学生和各阶层人民一起沉着地进行了保卫战。
    三千学生集中住在云南大学，等候分配去担任支持保卫战的任何工作。有的冒着炮火轰射的危险，带着慰劳品去前线劳军。他们唱歌、跳舞、争取与鼓励保卫团和警察勇敢杀敌立功，争取做光荣的人民解放军。有的去修理城墙缺口，建筑防御工事和堡垒。医科学生则参加了救护队，和医生护士一起工作。当一个地方遭到轰炸，他们便立刻赶到那里进行救护工作，并帮助清理街道。其他散居在学校中的教授学生，则组织起来护校守校，防止特务乘机破坏。散居在家庭中的师生员工，则参加全市性的市民守夜巡夜。一部分学生直接参加维持治安的义勇自卫队，担任政治工作。
    符合着学运发展的规律，当昆明各阶层人民在昆明学运影响下觉悟与组织起来的时候，昆明学运就溶化到在规模和影响上都远较学运为宏大深远的群众运动中去了。这在昆明的保卫战中显得更其清晰。那时候，昆明广大人民尤其是工人、农民已有着高度的政治觉悟，准备坚强不屈地抗击蒋匪残军，而关于匪军的“自由三天”的传闻，更促使昆明各阶层人民包括工商界、公教人员、地方武装等都紧紧团结起来，在十八日至二十二日的昆明保卫战中发挥了各自的作用。工人、农民和市民首先组织了三千人的“义勇自卫队”代替上前线的警察维持了城内的治安，市民们组织起来建筑防御工事守夜、巡夜，医生和护士都参加了救护工作，工商金融界人士募集了大批慰劳品。工人们在保卫战中充分显出了无产阶级无畏的气魄。位置在火线上的云南纺纱厂和裕滇纺纱厂工人们在一小时之内将存棉都搬出来修筑工事。许多男工直接上前线参加作战，或参加义勇守卫队维持治安。女工们留在厂里护厂。她们拿了长枪、短枪扑在围墙上帮助打敌人。在昆明各阶层人民为保卫生命财产免受国民党残匪的破坏与摧残的自卫情绪的鼓舞下，保卫团和警察们，作战也很英勇。当五十个匪军突进了焦山桥时，守卫着的警察枪械既不好子弹也少，在这样危急的情况下他们接住了匪军未爆炸的手榴弹反掷过去，炸死了匪军，他们也全部牺牲。守卫着南窑（离城只有一二里路）的保卫团十二团阻击了三倍挟有美式最新武器的匪军，全团伤亡将近三分之一仍然坚守了阵地。
    在昆明人民这样顽强、团结的抗御之下，配合滇桂黔纵队的后路拦击，进犯昆明的国民党匪军终于在十二月二十二日溃退了。
            （四）迎接解放
    昆明保卫战以后，昆明学生就像所有解放初期的学生一样，公开地幸福地认真地学习着革命知识，并一面帮助肃清特务，维持革命秩序，和各阶层人民一起筹备迎接解放军。
    昆明学生在解放前后这样一段紧张的战斗的日子里，始终很好地团结了教师和学校当局，坚持了上课（除保卫战时停了几天课）。因而创造了许多工作上的有利条件。等到一九五○年二月中解放军进驻昆明时，昆明学生才有了寒假，欢天喜地地迎接解放军。
    但他们认识到这不过是以更顽强的战斗精神进行学习的开始！
