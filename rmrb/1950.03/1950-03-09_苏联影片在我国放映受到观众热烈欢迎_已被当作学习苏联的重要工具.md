Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th. The screening of Soviet films in China has been warmly welcomed by Chinese audiences and has become an important method for our people to learn from the Soviet Union. The distribution of Soviet films in China began after 1930. The first Soviet film screened in China was a children's educational film, "The Road to Life." Later, a heroic biographical film depicting the Soviet Civil War period, "Chapayev," was also screened. During the Anti-Japanese War period in Chongqing, Soviet films such as "Lenin in October," "Lenin in 1918," "Nightingale, Nightingale," and "The Turnip" were screened. In the early years of Soviet films being imported into China, approximately more than two hundred films were screened in various parts of China.

After World War II, the distribution of Soviet films in China expanded. War documentaries such as "Stalingrad," "The Fall of Berlin," "The Defeat of Japanese Imperialism," and newsreels of Moscow parades and sports events, especially the color film "The Stone Flower," were widely welcomed by audiences in China. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the distribution of Soviet films was greatly hindered, making it impossible to reach a wider audience.

			Soviet		1948		1.3 million
			Films		1949		More than 7 million
			Audiences	(mainly in the second half of the year)

Due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the liberated Chinese people have expressed a warm welcome to the film art of the Soviet working people. In 1949 alone, the number of viewers of Soviet films in China increased unprecedentedly. According to statistics, the audience for Soviet films screened in China in 1948 was 1.3 million, while in 1949, mainly in the second half of the year, the number of viewers reached more than 7 million (excluding the Northeast).

Among these Soviet films, the most popular with Chinese audiences were: "Story of a Real Man," "The Steel-Tempered," "The Russian Question," "The People's Avengers," "The Third Blow," "Teacher," "Siberian Symphony," etc., especially the film "The Young Guard," which had 500,000 viewers in Beijing and Tianjin alone. In particular, young people were deeply moved after watching this film collectively and requested to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League one after another. Chinese male and female teachers regard the protagonist of "Village Teacher" as their role model.

In order to make it easier for Chinese audiences to understand Soviet films, the Soviet Film Export Company began to produce films with Chinese subtitles in 1947, and documentaries were made with Chinese narration. In 1948, the company produced the first art film with Chinese dialogue in Moscow, which was "The Stone Flower." From 1948 to 1949, the company produced Chinese dubbed films in Moscow, including "Miklouho-Maclay," "Siberian Symphony," "The Distant Bride," "The Young Guard" (Parts 1 and 2), and "Meeting on the Elbe."

Since 1949, the Northeast Film Studio of the Central People's Government's Film Bureau has been producing dubbed Chinese versions of Soviet films. The successful ones already produced include "Story of a Real Man," "The Russian Question," and "The Great Turning Point." The Central People's Government Film Bureau also plans to translate 30 to 40 Soviet art films into Chinese dubbed versions in 1950. As for the production of Chinese narration for Soviet documentaries and the addition of subtitles to art films, the work will mainly be carried out in Moscow.

　　苏联影片在我国放映  受到观众热烈欢迎
    已被当作学习苏联的重要工具
    【新华社北京八日电】苏联影片在中国的放映，已经受到我国观众的热烈欢迎，并成为我国人民学习苏联的重要方法。苏联影片在中国的发行，是从一九三零年以后才开始的，第一部在中国放映的苏联影片是一部儿童教育片《生路》，后来又放映过一部描写苏联内战时期的英雄传记片《夏伯阳》。在抗日战争时期的重庆，苏联影片曾有《列宁在十月》、《列宁在一九一八年》、《夜莺曲》和《大萝卜》等片放映。苏联影片输入中国的最初几年中，约有二百余部影片在中国各地放映。
    到第二次世界大战以后，苏联影片在中国扩大了发行。如战争纪录片《斯大林格勒》、《攻陷柏林》、《粉碎暴日》和莫斯科检阅、运动会等新闻纪录片，特别是五彩影片《宝石花》，在中国普遍地受到观众的欢迎。但是在国民党反动派统治下，苏联影片的发行工作，受到了很大的阻碍，无法接近更广大的群众。
            苏联        一九四八        一百三十万人
            影片        一九四九        七百余万人
            观众      （主要是下半年）
    由于中国人民革命伟大的胜利，解放以后的中国人民，对于苏联劳动人民的电影艺术表示热烈的欢迎。在一九四九年一年之内，苏联影片在中国的观众数字空前地增加。据统计：一九四八年在中国放映苏联影片的观众是一百三十万人，而一九四九年，主要是下半年，观众的数字已达七百余万人（东北尚未计算在内）。
    在这些苏联影片中，最受中国观众欢迎的是：《普通一兵》、《钢铁意志》、《俄罗斯问题》、《游击抗战》、《三次攻击》、《玛丽特传》、《西伯利亚交响乐》等片，尤以《青年近卫军》一片，仅在北京、天津两地放映，观众即达五十万人。特别是青年们，集体观看这一影片后，受到深深感动，纷纷要求加入了中国新民主主义青年团。中国的男女教师们则把《乡村女教师》的主人公看作是自己的典范。
    苏联影片输出公司为了使中国观众容易了解苏联影片起见，从一九四七年起开始制作中文字幕片，纪录片并制成华语解说。一九四八年该公司在莫斯科曾试作华语对白的艺术影片，当时制成的华语对白片为《宝石花》。从一九四八年到一九四九年间，该公司在莫斯科制成的华语对白片，有《马克莱探险记》、《西伯利亚交响乐》、《远方未婚妻》、《青年近卫军》上下集和《易比河会师》等片。
    中央人民政府文化部电影局东北电影制片厂从一九四九年起，将苏联影片制作华语对白的翻译片，已经制作成功的有《普通一兵》、《俄罗斯问题》和《大转变》等片。中央人民政府电影局并计划在一九五零年内，翻译三十部到四十部华语对白的苏联艺术片；至于苏联纪录片制作华语解说和艺术片加印字幕的工作，主要还是在莫斯科进行。
