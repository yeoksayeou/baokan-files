　　Exposing Unscrupulous Merchants' Double-Bookkeeping Tricks
　　Beijing Uncovers Large-Scale Tax Evasion
　　Continuing Investigation to Achieve Fairness and Reasonableness.
　　[Our Newspaper] Reporter Lin Hong reports: The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau has successively discovered cases of unscrupulous merchants privately creating false accounts to evade taxes in March. The second sub-bureau of the bureau recently uncovered three business firms with serious tax evasion. One is the Deyigong Grain Store, which privately carved fake watermarks to evade business and stamp taxes. Since September of last year, the grain store has used six fake watermarks to evade a total of more than 329,000 yuan in business tax, more than 77,000 yuan in transaction tax, and more than 370,000 yuan in stamp tax; and used the fake watermark of "Beijing Deji Rice Store" to purchase grain from customers. Another is Dingfengyuan, which used vinegar making as a cover to secretly trade gold and silver. Since February of last year, it has successively resold more than 1,800 silver dollars and more than 21 taels of gold; and secretly operated a black silver shop to handle small deposits and loans. Another is the Dachang Flour Mill, which did not register large amounts of inflow and outflow of goods, evading a total of more than 981,000 yuan in business tax, more than 100,000 yuan in stamp tax, and more than 220,000 yuan in transaction tax. In addition to ordering these three stores to pay back taxes and impose penalties, the Second Sub-bureau also held a forum for business owners in the area on the 25th to expose the illegal activities of these three stores and to educate merchants with similar behaviors who have not yet been discovered. At the meeting, the public was indignant and criticized such illegal activities. Mao Zhenxi, manager of Tongheju, said: "Tax evasion is a criminal act that violates government laws and regulations, undermines financial policies, and infringes upon the interests of the people." Liu Jian, manager of Longxingchang, said: "Tax evasion by one household affects everyone and damages the overall business reputation. We must oppose such lawbreakers who only value personal interests and infringe upon the interests of the people." After being criticized and educated at the conference, these tax evaders have realized their mistakes. Zhang Zongyao, manager of Deyigong, said: "We have realized that this is an act that violates the interests of the people. We have decided to correct ourselves in the future and hope that everyone will not learn from me."
　　In addition, the Municipal Taxation Bureau, in conjunction with the Third Sub-bureau, discovered a set of false accounts in the Daming Commercial Firm in Chongwai on March 6. After verification, the industrial and commercial tax actually paid by the firm in the first half of last year was only 7% of what it should have paid. A large number of taxable goods such as fountain pens, pigments, and fabrics were also found in the cavity wall of the firm, totaling more than 5 million yuan in supplementary tax. In addition, the firm also evaded more than 80,000 yuan in stamp tax. The Taxation Bureau ordered it to pay supplementary tax in accordance with the regulations and provided education.
　　On March 16, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce discovered a set of internal accounts in the Tongshengyong Paint Store on Qianwai Street. The Municipal Taxation Bureau's Investigation Section immediately combined with the Bureau of Commerce to check the accounts of the main merchants who had dealings with it, such as Yuanhetai, Gongshengyi, Xinyuanhao, and Taipinhao, based on the records in the internal accounts. The records in the account books of the above-mentioned firms did not show any transaction with Tongshengyong. They also firmly denied having internal accounts or used the excuse that the internal accounts had been burned to prevaricate. After repeated questioning, Yuanhetai and Gongshengyi took out some incomplete internal accounts. According to these more than ten firms, they had already agreed among themselves that there would be no accounting for transactions between peers. This means that these firms did one set of business in front of the counter and another set of business behind the counter. The set of business done behind the counter was naturally not subject to various taxes before it was discovered. The main business income from the set of business done in front of the counter was recorded in the internal accounts, while many expenses unrelated to the business were recorded in the front accounts. For example, Yuanhetai Paint Store had branches in Tianjin and Shanghai, but none of the business income of these branches was recorded in the front accounts of the store. The branch in Shanghai partnered with someone to buy a boat last year, and the interest payable on the loan for buying the boat was borne by Yuanhetai. This increased expenses in the front accounts, creating the appearance of a loss or at least no profit. The set of business done in front of the counter could then avoid paying or reduce tax payments. This matter involves a wide range and is still under investigation. In addition, the Third Sub-bureau also discovered a set of internal accounts in the Changji Commercial Firm, with a situation similar to the former. These two facts show that many unscrupulous merchants have both internal and external accounts. In order to prevent tax revenue from being lost, how to check false accounts in the future is an important and regular task. Only by eliminating false accounts can the burden of various taxes be generally fair and reasonable.

　　揭穿不法商人两套账的鬼把戏
    京查获大批偷漏税
    正继续追查，以求公平合理。
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：京市税务局于三月份陆续发现不法商人私造假账偷漏税款的事件。该局所属的第二分局，近查获三个严重漏税的商号。一个是私刻假水印逃避行商和印花等税的德义公粮栈。自去年九月起，该粮栈利用假水印六颗，先后偷漏行商税三十二万九千余元，交易税七万七千余元，印花税三十七万余元；并用“北京德记米庄”的假水印，购买客人的粮食。一个是借造醋作掩护暗中倒买金银的鼎丰源，自去年二月起，先后倒卖银元一千八百余元，黄金二十一两多；并暗中经营黑银号，办理小额存放款。另外一个是大昌面粉厂，巨额的进销货流水都不登记，共漏行商税九十八万一千多元，印花税十万余元，交易税二十二万余元。二分局除令这三个商店补缴税款并加以处罚外，并于二十五日召开界内各商户座谈会，揭露该三商店的不法行为，并借以教育有类似行为而尚未被查获的商人。会上群情愤激，纷纷对此种不法行为予以指摘。同和居经理毛振西说：“偷捐漏税是违反政府法令、破坏财经政策、侵犯人民利益的罪恶行为。”龙兴长经理刘鉴说：“一家漏税影响全体，破坏了整个的商誉。我们要反对这种只重个人利益、侵犯人民利益的不法分子。”这些漏税户经大会批评教育后，已认识到自己的错误。德义公经理张宗尧说：“我们已认识到这是违反人民利益的行为，以后决定改过，并且希望大家不要向我学。”
    此外，市税务局结合三分局，于三月六日在崇外达明商号查出了一套假账。核算结果，该号去年上半年实纳的工商税，仅为其应纳的百分之七，在该号夹壁墙内并查出大批水笔、颜料、布匹等应税货物，共应补税五百余万元。除此以外，该号还偷漏印花税八万余元。税务局令其照章补税，并给予教育。
    三月十六日，市商业局在前外大街同盛永颜料庄查出内账一套。市税局稽查科当即结合商业局根据内账的记载，到与其往来的主要商户元合泰、公盛义、信远号、泰品号等十家对账。从上述商号账簿的记载上，均看不出与同盛永有交易行为。他们并坚决否认设有内账，或以内账已烧掉来搪塞。经再三追问，元合泰及公盛义才拿出了一些不完全的内账。据这十多家商号谈，他们相互之间早已言明，同行往来互不走账。这就是说这些商号在柜台前作了一套生意，在柜台后又作了一套生意。柜台后作的这一套生意，在未查出前，自然不上应纳的各种税。而柜台前作的一套生意，则把主要的营业收入都记在内账上，许多与营业无关的开支却记在前账上。如元合泰颜料庄在津、沪均有坐庄，但各该坐庄的营业收入，在该号的前账上一笔也没有。而该号在沪的坐庄去年与人合伙买了一只船，买船借款应付的利息却由元合泰来负担。这样在前账上增加开支，就形成了表面上亏本或至少不赚钱的现象。在柜台前作的这一套生意，也就可以不纳或少纳税款了。此事因牵涉较广，正继续进行追查中。另外三分局也查出昌记商号一套内账，情形与前者相似。这两件事实说明：许多不法的商人均有内外两套账。为了不使税收受损失，今后如何检查假账，是一件重要的经常的工作。只有消灭了假账，各种税收的负担才能普遍的作到公平合理。
