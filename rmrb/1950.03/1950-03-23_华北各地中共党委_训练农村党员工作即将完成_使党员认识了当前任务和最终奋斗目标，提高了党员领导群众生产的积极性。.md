Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Communist Party organizations in North China are nearing completion of training for rural Party members. The Communist Party local committees of Shijiazhuang, Ding County, Tong County, Cang County, and Tianjin in Hebei Province have trained over 30,000 Party members. Fifteen county committees in Shanxi Province, including Ping顺, Huguan, and Qinyuan, have trained over 20,000 Party members. In Pingyuan Province, each county committee will be able to train one-quarter to one-third of all Party members before the spring plowing season.

The training content for Party members in various regions mainly includes New Democracy construction, social development history (with emphasis on the future of the revolution), current events, the Party Constitution, and Party building. Before the training, most rural Party members had vague understandings of the future of social development, which affected their enthusiasm for current production and construction. Based on the aforementioned ideological conditions of the Party members, the CCP committees in various regions conducted systematic and focused education, enabling Party members to correctly understand the bright future of communist society; then, they explained in detail the various economic policies in New Democracy construction to the Party members. This enabled Party members to ideologically understand the current tasks of the revolution and the ultimate goal of the struggle, thereby greatly enhancing the enthusiasm of Party member cadres in leading the masses in production. Secondly, in the education of Party building and the Party Constitution, all regions focused on how to be a good Party member. The trained Party members carefully examined their past shortcomings based on the Party's requirements for Party members and established goals for future efforts in transformation. For example, some Party members, during this period of study, focused on examining the ideological roots and harmfulness of the commandist work style, resolving to admit their mistakes to the masses in order to thoroughly correct them.

The reason why this Party member training work has achieved the above results is mainly due to the importance and specific guidance given by Party committees at all levels to the centralized training of Party members; at the same time, it is also due to the fact that before the start of the training, Party organizations in various regions conducted more adequate ideological mobilization for the trained Party members and helped them solve their personal and family difficulties; the cadres responsible for the training were also educated, and they were organized to study the principles and teaching materials of the centralized training.

However, some shortcomings and deviations have also occurred in individual regions in grasping the principles and methods of centralized training. For example, some Party committees did not sufficiently study and understand the training principles and content of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which focused on New Democracy construction supplemented by social development history (with emphasis on the future of the revolution) education and current affairs education, and they treated the training content equally or even reversed the priorities; some limited the training class to solving the existing ideological problems of Party members or only to mobilizing them to complete the current work tasks; some regions adopted a perfunctory attitude, training for the sake of training, without a plan or purpose. After discovering the above problems and deviations, the CCP committees in various regions quickly corrected them, ensuring the smooth completion of the training of Party members.

　　华北各地中共党委
    训练农村党员工作即将完成
    使党员认识了当前任务和最终奋斗目标，提高了党员领导群众生产的积极性。
    【新华社二十一日讯】华北各地共产党组织训练农村党员的工作现已接近完成。河北省石家庄、定县、通县、沧县、天津等五个共产党地方委员会共训练党员三万余人。山西省平顺、壶关、沁源等十五个县委，训练了党员二万余人。平原省各县委在春耕前也可训练全体党员数的四分之一到三分之一。
    各地党员训练的内容主要为新民主主义建设、社会发展史（着重革命前途）和时事、党章、党的建设等。在训练开始前，多数农村党员对社会发展的前途存在着模糊认识，因而影响了对目前生产建设的积极性。各地中共党委即根据党员上述思想情况，分别进行了有系统而有重点的教育，使党员正确认识了共产主义社会的光明前途；然后再向党员详细讲解新民主主义建设中的各种经济政策。这样就使党员从思想上认识了革命的当前任务和最终的奋斗目标，因而大大提高了党员干部领导群众生产的积极性。其次，各地在进行党的建设与党章的教育中，都着重地进行了怎样作个好党员的教育，受训党员均依据党对党员要求的标准，认真检查自己过去所存在的缺点，并树立起今后努力改造的目标。如有的党员在这段学习中，着重检查了强迫命令作风的思想根源及其危害性，决心向群众承认自己的错误，以求彻底改正。
    这次党员训练工作，所以能取得上述成绩，主要是由于各级党委对集训党员工作的重视和具体指导；同时，也由于在训练开始前各地党的组织对受训党员均进行了较充分的思想动员并帮助党员解决其个人和家庭的困难；对负责训练的干部，也进行了教育，组织他们学习了集训的方针和教材等。
    但个别地区在掌握集训方针和作法上亦曾发生了某些缺点与偏差。如有些党委对中共中央华北局的以新民主主义建设为主，辅之以社会发展史（着重革命前途）教育和时事教育的训练方针和内容，研究和体会不够，把集训内容平列起来甚或轻重倒置；有些则把训练班仅限于解决党员现存的思想问题，或仅为动员完成当前的工作任务；有些地区则采取了草率从事的态度，为训练而训练，无计划、无目的。各地中共党委在发现上述问题和偏差之后，大都迅速予以纠正，保证了训练党员工作的顺利完成。
