　　How I Played the Political Commissar
　　——A "White Warrior" Actor's Autobiography
　　Lu Fei
　　After the "White Warrior" film crew arrived at the location shooting site—Jinan, the actors studied the script of each scene together, and the director also told the actors about the theme of the script and his requirements. I understood that the political commissar in the play played the role of the Party's leadership.
　　We went to the Third Rear Hospital in Jinan to experience life. I attended a hospital meeting to arrange the relocation, visited their surgery work, and listened to two political instructors talk in detail about their experiences and the ideological processes at various stages of their work. I tried my best to experience their feelings: they were so optimistic, so meticulously caring for the wounded, and so engrossed in their work that they forgot to eat and sleep...
　　I wrote down all these bits and pieces of material in my notebook. I handed over all the gains from the five days of experiencing life to the director. After the director refined my material, I determined the character of the political commissar.
　　The political commissar joined the revolution during the Anti-Japanese War. He worked as a soldier, squad leader, clerk, and political instructor. He was wounded in the arduous war. He is extremely enthusiastic, has a high degree of class consciousness and a firm belief in the revolution, and his work style is calm and steady. His cooperation with Captain Zhuang Yi is enough to ensure that Zhuang Yi can devote all his energy to medical work. They respect each other.
　　I once designed to draw a scar on his face to highlight that he was a battle-tested people's soldier. However, I only thought of this point of external sculpting and failed to implement it; because the weather was very hot when shooting outdoors, it was inconvenient to carry out special makeup. Fortunately, this point is not enough to affect the integrity of the entire character.
　　Outdoor shooting began. When shooting the scenes of marching and transferring on a rainy night, I tried to grasp the political commissar's concern for the wounded. In the enemy's bombing scene, I focused on showing the political commissar's calmness and steadiness, and at the same time wanted to express the feeling of hatred for the enemy.
　　"White Warrior" is completed. The development of the political commissar's emotions is not clear between some shots; and the point of "hatred for the enemy" makes it difficult for me to see on the screen.
　　This time's work, I can't talk about any "creation". I still need to study for a long time and work hard to improve myself, so that I can become a better people's film actor.

　　我怎样扮演协理员
    ——“白衣战士”演员自述
    鲁非
    在“白衣战士”摄制组到达外景拍摄地——济南后，演员们在一起研究了分场剧本，导演也对演员讲述了剧本主题和他的要求。我了解了协理员这一人物，在剧中是起着党的领导作用的。
    我们到济南第三后方医院去体验生活。我参加了一次院部布置搬家的会议，参观了他们施行手术的工作，并曾听过两个教导员同志详细地谈了他们的经历和工作中各个阶段的思想过程。我竭力想体验他们的感情：他们是那样乐观，那样无微不至地爱护伤员，为工作废寝忘食………。
    这些点点滴滴的材料，我都一一记在笔记本上。我把五天来体验生活的收获，完全交给了导演，经过导演对我材料的提炼，我确定了协理员这个人物的性格。
    协理员是抗战时期参加革命的，他做过战士、班长、文书、政治指导员等工作。在艰苦的战争中，他负过伤。他极其热情，有着高度的阶级觉悟与对革命的坚定信心，他工作作风沉着稳重。他和队长庄毅合作，足以保证庄毅能将全部精力用在医务工作上。他们是互相尊重的。
    我曾设计在他的面部上画一块伤痕，来突出他是身经百战的人民战士。然而我仅想到的这一点外形上的雕塑也未能实行；因为拍摄外景时，天气酷热，不便进行特殊化妆。好在这一点，还不足以影响整个人物性格的完整性。
    外景开拍了。当拍雨夜进军及转移的场面时，我努力想抓住协理员关怀伤员的心情。在敌机轰炸场面，我着重地表现了协理员的沉着和稳重，同时想把对敌人仇恨的情感表现出来。
    “白衣战士”完成了。协理员这一人物，在有些镜头与镜头间，他的情绪的发展还不明确；而“对敌仇恨”这点，使我自己在银幕上，也很难看得出来。
    这一次工作，我是谈不到有什么“创造”的。我还要长期学习，努力锻炼自己，使自己成为一个更好的人民电影演员。
