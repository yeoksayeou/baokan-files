International Briefs

　　At the invitation of the British International Women's Day Committee, a Soviet women's delegation left for London on the 6th to participate in the celebration of International Women's Day. The delegation consists of five people, led by Dubrovinina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

　　On the 3rd, Gretchukha, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, accepted the credentials presented by Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Radhakrishnan, at the Kremlin.

　　At the recent National Congress, the Vietnam United Youth Federation for National Salvation decided to change its name to the Vietnam People's Democratic Youth Federation.

　　The Vietnamese Ministry of National Education recently announced: From 1945 to 1949, the number of literate people in Vietnam increased from 2.18 million to 11.58 million; the number of primary school students increased from 284,300 to 475,300.

　　The South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government announced on March 3 that it recognized the three puppet regimes of Bao Dai, Laos, and Cambodia created by France in Vietnam, and announced that it had established diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain.

　　The U.S. Bureau of the Census released reduced figures admitting that the number of unemployed in the United States had increased to 4,684,000 in February, an increase of 244,000 from January. This is the highest figure since August 1941.

　　According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, there are currently 390,000 private enterprises in the United States, which is 67,000 fewer than in 1948. This illustrates the concentration of U.S. monopoly capital and the massive bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises.

　　Twenty-one leaders of the Iranian People's Party are currently being exiled by the Iranian government to prisons on islands in the Persian Gulf. Among those exiled are Dr. Kiali, former professor at Tehran University, Dr. Yazhi, former Minister of Public Health, and writer Kasimi. They were sentenced to ten years in prison a year ago.
