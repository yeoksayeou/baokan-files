    (Twenty-five)
    That night, Cui Cui didn't close her eyes. She knew that once someone was identified as a Communist, Genyuan would be dead. She remembered that half a month ago, she happened to be in the city when Communists were executed by firing squad. The people being executed were covered in blood after being shot, and when their families came to collect the bodies, they cried so sadly that everyone who saw it cried, including Cui Cui.
    (Twenty-six)
    Cui Cui thought of this tragic scene and of Genyuan's fate, and couldn't help but cry, her tears soaking the pillow. As she cried, she thought, "I will risk my life to save Genyuan!" She made up her mind, quietly got up, took some clothes and a pickaxe, and went out.
    (Twenty-seven)
    It was midnight, very dark, and a cold wind hit her face. She went around the village to the back of the village office, found the back wall of the coal room, and began to dig with the pickaxe. Soon she had dug a hole and released Genyuan.
    (Twenty-eight)
    Genyuan held Cui Cui's hand and said, "I won't die, I will avenge this! You are still young, find someone else. I don't know if I'll live or die after I escape." Cui Cui cried and said, "When I'm alive, I'm your family's person, and when I die, I'm your family's ghost. I will never change my heart." The two of them cried in the strong wind. Cui Cui gave Genyuan the clothes she had brought and the two silver bracelets as travel money. Genyuan fled the village that night.

    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （二十五）
    夜里，翠翠没合眼，她知道一说成共产党，根元就没活命了。她想起前半月在城里正好碰上枪毙共产党，被枪毙的人被枪打后，流一身血，最后，家里人来收尸，他们都哭的那样伤心，看的人都哭了，翠翠也哭了。
    （二十六）
    翠翠想到这一幅悲惨的情景，想到根元的命运，不由的哭泣起来，眼泪印湿了枕头。她哭着，她想着，她想：“拚上命也要把根元救出来！”她打好了主意，悄悄起来，拿了几件衣服、一把镐头出来了。
    （二十七）
    半夜了，天黑得很，冷风迎面扑来。她从村外绕到村公所后面，找到炭房的后墙，便用镐头开始刨了起来，不一会儿便刨了一个洞，她把根元放了出来。
    （二十八）
    根元握着翠翠的手说：“我死不了，总要报这仇！你还年青，趁早寻个主，我逃出去还不知道死活呢。”翠翠哭着说：“我活着是你家的人，死是你家的鬼，我至死总不变心。……”俩口子在大风里抱着哭了一场。翠翠把带来的衣服，给根元换上，又把两只银手镯给根元做路费，根元就连夜逃出村子去了。
