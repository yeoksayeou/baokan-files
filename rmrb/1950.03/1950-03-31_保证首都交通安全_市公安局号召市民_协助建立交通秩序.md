　　Guaranteeing Traffic Safety in the Capital
    Municipal Public Security Bureau Calls on Citizens to Assist in Establishing Traffic Order

    [Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Office: In order to further reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents and ensure traffic safety in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, in addition to actively organizing traffic arteries, registering vehicles, and strengthening management, is also calling on citizens throughout the city to assist in the establishment of traffic order, and reduce unnecessary losses to the people's lives and property.

    In the eleven months from February to December of last year, a total of 388 traffic accidents occurred, with losses to vehicles and property alone estimated to be worth approximately 23,770 jin of millet. Most of the accidents were caused by careless driving.

    In the first three months of this year, compared to last year, although the number of vehicles has increased, the number of traffic accidents has relatively decreased. In addition to careless driving or negligence on the part of the victims, trucks and animal-drawn vehicles, due to excessive loads or being relatively bulky, are also major causes of accidents. In the past three months, accidents involving trucks and animal-drawn vehicles accounted for slightly less than two-thirds of the total. Accidents mostly occur on major thoroughfares, and the time of day when they are most likely to happen is during the morning and afternoon rush hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. In the past three months, accidents occurring during these times accounted for slightly less than three-quarters of the total. Victims are mostly children under the age of fifteen, accounting for slightly more than one-half of all victims in the past three months.

    In order to ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, the Municipal Public Security Bureau calls on all citizens to strictly abide by traffic regulations and assist the government in consolidating traffic order; at the same time, attention should also be paid to the following points:

    1. All agencies and military units should strengthen the education of drivers. Traffic regulations are essential learning materials for every driver.

    2. Strictly examine the skills of drivers. Qualified drivers should be issued driving licenses, and those with poor skills should be absolutely prohibited from driving.

    3. Pay attention to the inspection of vehicle parts at all times.

    4. Absolutely abide by traffic regulations and obey the instructions of traffic police.

    5. During the commuting hours of various agencies and factories, or when passing through busy areas, both pedestrians and vehicles should pay special attention.

    6. When children cross the road, adults should take good care of them and strictly prohibit children from playing games on the road.
