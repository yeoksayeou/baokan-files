　　French Women Vow:
	No American War Materials Allowed into France
    维美徐 declared that we women communists vow again: to strengthen our struggle against the war in Vietnam. We will not be intimidated by the extremely shameful laws that the reactionary French government is preparing. If the capitalists launch a new world war, French women will take up arms with their husbands, brothers, and sons to stop it. Amidst thunderous applause, Mrs. Gordon read out the French women's oath: to stop the war policy pursued by the French government; to prevent American war materials from reaching French ports; to fight for the prohibition of atomic bombs; to assist their husbands and brothers in their struggle against the production, transportation, and handling of war materials; to oppose extremely shameful laws; to provide all assistance to striking workers and their children; and to prevent their brothers and sons from being sent to participate in imperialist wars of aggression.
    Further News: The Belgian Women's League for Peace held a grand demonstration in Brussels on the 5th, attended by 5,000 people. The demonstrators carried banners with slogans commemorating March 8th and defending peace; and held a mass rally where a resolution was passed, calling on women across the country to participate in the struggle to defend peace.

　　法国妇女宣誓：
    不许美国战争物资到法国
    维美徐宣称，我们女共产党人再度宣誓：要加强我们反对越南战争的斗争。我们不会被法国反动政府正在准备中的极度可耻的法律所吓倒。如果资本家发动新的世界战争，法国妇女将与她们的丈夫、兄弟和儿子一同拿起武器，予以制止。戈登夫人在暴风雨般的掌声中宣读法国妇女的誓言：制止法国政府所奉行的战争政策；不许美国战争物资到达法国口岸；为禁止原子弹而斗争；援助她们的丈夫和兄弟们的反对生产、运输、和搬运战争物资的斗争；反对极端可耻的法律；给罢工工人及其子女以一切援助；制止派遣她们的兄弟和儿子去参加帝国主义侵略战争。
    又讯：比利时妇女争取和平同盟五日在布鲁塞尔主持有五千人参加的盛大示威。示威者携有写着各种纪念三八节和保卫和平口号的标语；并举行了群众大会，会上通过决议，号召全国妇女参加保卫和平的斗争。
