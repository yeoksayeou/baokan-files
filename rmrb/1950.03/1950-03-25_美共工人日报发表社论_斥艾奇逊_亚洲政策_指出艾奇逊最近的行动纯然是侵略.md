　　US Communist Party's Worker Daily Publishes Editorial
    Denouncing Acheson's "Asian Policy"
    Pointing Out that Acheson's Recent Actions Are Purely Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 24th] The US Communist Party's organ, the Worker Daily, published an editorial on March 16th, commenting on Acheson's speech on March 15th, entitled "US Policy Towards Asia." The editorial stated: "Acheson's recent efforts are to announce that he will pour money, guns, and spies into Indochina, Burma, Malaya, and Indonesia, and of course, the Philippines." The editorial pointed out: The White House, seeing that its attempt to force the Chinese people to accept Chiang Kai-shek has failed, is now trying to hire a new little Chiang Kai-shek – Bao Dai – in Indochina. However, the editorial then said: "Since Washington could not make China accept Chiang Kai-shek, then what makes it think it can make Vietnam accept Bao Dai?"
    The editorial continued: "Acheson's recent actions are purely aggression." "The Truman Doctrine uses force and violence to prevent Western Europe from freely choosing socialism; it will also use force and violence to keep colonial countries in continued enslavement. And in the eyes of the leaders of the Cold War, even a little bit of national independence is proof of 'communist expansion'."
    The editorial concluded: Acheson's actions of spreading carnage and death in Southeast Asia explain why Washington is so afraid of holding any peace talks with the Soviet Union. Washington is unwilling to see the colonial people get rid of foreign rule, therefore, it is "intervening to seize the colonial empires that those old masters can no longer maintain."

　　美共工人日报发表社论
    斥艾奇逊“亚洲政策”
    指出艾奇逊最近的行动纯然是侵略
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】美国共产党机关报工人日报十六日发表社论，评论艾奇逊三月十五日所谓《美国对亚洲的政策》的演说。社论称：“艾奇逊最近的努力是宣布他要把金钱、枪炮和间谍倾入印度支那、缅甸、马来亚与印尼，自然还有菲律宾。”社论指出：白宫看到他们迫使中国人民接受蒋介石已遭到失败，现正试图在印度支那雇用新的小蒋介石——保大。可是，社论接着说：“华盛顿既然不能使中国接受蒋介石，那末，什么使它想到它可以使越南接受保大呢？”
    社论继称：“艾奇逊最近的行动纯然是侵略”。“杜鲁门主义使用武力和暴力来阻止西欧自由选择社会主义；它并将使用武力和暴力使殖民地国家继续受奴役。而在冷战的领袖们看来，一点点民族独立的痕迹，都是‘共产主义扩张’的证明”。
    社论结语说：艾奇逊向东南亚散布残杀与死亡的行动，说明华盛顿为什么这样害怕与苏联举行任何和谈。华盛顿不愿看到殖民地人民摆脱外国统治，因此，它“正插手夺取那些旧主人再也保持不了的殖民地帝国。”
