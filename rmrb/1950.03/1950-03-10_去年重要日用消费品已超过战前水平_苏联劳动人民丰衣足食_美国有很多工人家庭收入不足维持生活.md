　　Last Year's Major Daily Consumer Goods Exceeded Pre-War Levels
    Soviet Working People are Well-Fed and Clothed
    Many American Workers' Families Have Insufficient Income to Maintain a Living
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch from TASS] The "Labor Daily" on February 26th used extensive materials to prove that the welfare of the Soviet working people is increasing daily. The newspaper cited many facts and figures regarding the Soviet national income, housing construction, and the increase in the number of Soviet workers, pointing out that life in the Soviet Union is getting better and better, with more abundant food and clothing.
    When discussing the improved living and cultural standards of the Soviet working people, the newspaper specifically pointed out that in 1948, the actual wages of employees increased more than twofold compared to 1947. In 1949, the sales volume of goods (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 20% compared to 1948, with food sales increasing by 17% and manufactured goods increasing by 25%. In 1949, the consumption of the most important daily necessities already exceeded pre-war levels.
    The "Labor Daily" declared that the situation in capitalist countries is very different. According to estimates by the University of California, the minimum weekly living expenses for American worker families are $75, while their wages are only $51. This means that their income is about one-third less than the minimum living expenses.
    In the Soviet Union, people can receive state subsidies, social insurance, and pensions, and can enter sanatoriums, rest homes, and children's recreational facilities for free or at reduced fees. Single mothers and mothers with many children can receive subsidies, and can also enjoy free medical care and free schooling and further education.
    In 1949, the Soviet people enjoyed state subsidies and preferential treatment amounting to 110 billion rubles—almost twice the amount in 1940.
    The Soviet state spends a large amount of money on the health and welfare of the working people. Last year alone, the total number of beds in newly opened and expanded hospitals increased by 38,000. The number of doctors increased by 26,000. The "Labor Daily" emphasized that this attention to public health is not and cannot be found in any capitalist country. In the United States, health problems are an incredible source of profit for monopolistic capitalists who manufacture and sell medicines. In the United States, almost 80% of families are completely deprived of the opportunity to enjoy medical treatment.
    The newspaper particularly emphasized the fundamental improvement of working conditions in the Soviet Union, stating that due to the constant attention of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, accidents in industry have decreased sharply. In the past 20 years, industrial accidents in Soviet enterprises have decreased by two-thirds, and accidents in some individual industries, such as the machinery manufacturing industry, the iron and steel smelting industry, and the chemical industry, have decreased by as much as three-quarters. Soviet industrial welfare and safety technology are based on science. Trade unions sponsor five research institutes and twelve laboratories engaged in research on safety technology and industrial hygiene. Soviet labor legislation—the most progressive legislation in the world—specifically stipulates more comfortable working conditions for women and minors. Such conditions are not and cannot be found in any capitalist country, where the lives and health of working people are worthless, and factory owners and workshop owners are only motivated by one thought—the thirst for profit. According to incomplete calculations, in 1946 alone, the number of workers in American industry who died, were disabled, or lost their jobs due to accidental events was equivalent to twice the total number of U.S. Army losses due to death, injury, and illness in the three and a half years of fighting against Germany and Japan. (According to U.S. Army Department figures, the total number of U.S. Army casualties, deaths, captures, and missing persons in World War II was 948,574.) From 1930 to 1949 alone, 1.2 million coal miners in the American coal mining industry died, were injured, or were disabled due to accidental events. In the United Kingdom, more than 200 accidents occur per thousand miners every year.

### 去年重要日用消费品已超过战前水平  苏联劳动人民丰衣足食  美国有很多工人家庭收入不足维持生活

　　去年重要日用消费品已超过战前水平
    苏联劳动人民丰衣足食
    美国有很多工人家庭收入不足维持生活
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二月二十六日劳动报以大量材料证明苏联劳动人民的福利正日益增进。该报援引了许多有关苏联国民收入、房屋建筑及苏联工人阶级人数增加的事实及数字，指出在苏联生活是越来越美好，越来越丰衣足食。
    该报说到苏联劳动人民生活及文化水准提高的情形时，特别指出说：一九四八年职工的实际薪资比一九四七年增加一倍以上。一九四九年物品销售额（以比较价格计算）较一九四八年增加百分之二十，其中食品销售量增加了百分之十七，制成品增加了百分之二十五。在一九四九年，最重要的日用品消费量，就已经超过战前水平。
    劳动报宣称：资本主义国家的情景就大不相同。据美国加利福尼亚大学估计：美国的工人家庭每周的最低生活费用是七十五美元，而其工资则仅为五十一美元，这就是说他们的收入约比最低生活费用少三分之一。
    在苏联，人民可以领到国家津贴、社会保险金和养老金等，可以免费或减费进疗养院、休憩所和儿童育乐机关，单身母亲及子女众多的母亲，可得津贴，还可以享受免费医疗与免费就学和进修。
    一九四九年，苏联人民享受了数达一千一百亿卢布的国家津贴及优待——这笔款项几为一九四○年的二倍。
    苏维埃国家为劳动人民的健康及福利，支出大量金钱。仅在去年，新开的及扩充的医院，其病床总数即增加了三万八千。医生增加了二万六千名。劳动报强调称：对公共卫生的这种注意，是任何资本主义国家所没有而且不可能有的。在美国，健康问题对于制造和售卖药品的垄断资本家来说，是令人难以置信的利润的泉源。在美国，几乎有百分之八十的家庭，完全被剥夺了享受医药治疗的机会。
    该报特别着重指出苏联工作条件的根本改进称：由于共产党及苏维埃国家的经常关注，在工业中的意外事件已急剧减少。过去二十年内，苏联企业中的工业意外事件减少了三分之二，而若干个别工业如器械制造工业、铁金属冶炼工业及化学工业的意外事件，竟减少了四分之三。苏联的工业福利及安全技术都是建基于科学之上的。工会主办了五个研究所和十二个实验室，从事于安全技术及工业卫生方面的调查研究工作。苏联劳动立法——世界最进步的立法——特别为妇女及未成年者规定较舒适的工作条件。这种条件是任何资本主义国家所没有而且不可能有的。在那里，劳苦人民的生命和健康一文不值，厂主及作坊主只被唯一的念头所激动——渴求利润。根据不完全的计算，仅在一九四六年内，美国工业中因偶然事件而致死、残废或失去工作能力的工人，其数目即相当于美国陆军在与德、日作战三年半内因死、伤及患病而损失的总人数之二倍。（按据美国陆军部数字，美国陆军在第二次世界大战中伤、亡、被俘、失踪总数为九十四万八千五百七十四人。）仅在一九三○年至一九四九年，美国采煤工业即有一百二十万挖煤工人因偶然事件而致死、受伤和残废。在英国，每年每千名矿工中总要发生意外事件两百多起。
