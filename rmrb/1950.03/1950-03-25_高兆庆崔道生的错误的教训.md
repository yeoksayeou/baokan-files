Lessons from the Mistakes of Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng
    Communist Party of China, Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, General Branch Committee
    We agree with and accept the criticism and suggestions made by the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on March 14th. We will publicly publish the lessons we have learned for the reference of our comrades.
    The Second Electric Motor Repair Shop of the Telecommunications Bureau had a series of theft incidents. Comrades Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng did not rely on the masses for in-depth investigation. Instead, they illegally detained worker Dai Pingzhen and searched workers' dormitories. They neither asked for instructions beforehand nor reported afterward, deviated from the masses, and violated policies, laws, and disciplines, causing a serious error of infringing on human rights. They forgot that a Communist Party member should abide by the laws of the People's Government and be a model of integrity and law-abidingness. This also shows a lack of study of the Party's policies, insufficient understanding of organizational discipline, and disregard for the reminders of the masses.
    The basic reason for Gao and Cui's mistakes is ideological conservatism and a lack of learning about new things. Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng were both cadres who joined the People's Liberation Army in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. For more than ten years, they worked diligently in military factories, overcame difficulties, buried themselves in hard work, never caring about personal gains or losses, and striving to serve the people. They achieved good results and completed the production tasks in the then-military environment. Since entering the city, on the one hand, they have maintained the style of hard work and plain living. On the other hand, their ideological awareness and work style have been characterized by a simplistic way of working, looseness, and guerrilla habits. This style was wrong in the past, but they have never corrected it and have applied it to today's enterprise management. The occurrence of this mistake stems from this. Even though they had committed a serious error of infringing on human rights, they did not realize it at the time. They did not know how to use democratic methods to manage public enterprises, but were accustomed to command-style, independent work methods. Although the factory management committee of the factory had been established for a long time, they did not understand the significance of the factory management committee, which led to independent action, blind neglect of democratic management, and self-righteousness. They only knew vaguely about relying on the workers, but in practice, they became detached from the workers, neglected the interests of the trade union organization and workers, and arbitrarily searched and detained trade union members. What is even more serious is that at the time, they still thought this was a "minor matter." This should arouse serious vigilance among our veteran comrades! In addition to deeply examining our thoughts and actions, we must face reality, study diligently, and learn from the comrades around us and from the workers.
    The mistakes of Gao and Cui were due, on the one hand, to the ideological and work style problems of the two comrades themselves. On the other hand, our general branch leadership did not provide enough help, education, enlightenment, and guidance to these two comrades under the new circumstances. Our leadership work was not thorough enough, and we failed to discover their ideological errors in time, let alone actively seek ways to prevent the occurrence of this incident.
    This incident also tells us that the opinions of the masses are correct. For example, when we conducted an investigation, analyzed the causes and nature of the error, and proposed two solutions (handling according to legal procedures or mediation), the workers all agreed to adopt the mediation method. Also, when Gao and Cui sincerely admitted their mistakes at the general meeting and asked everyone to help them and supervise them to correct their mistakes, the workers said on the spot: "As long as the rights and wrongs are clarified and the responsibilities are defined, we have no objections." Some workers also said: "In the past, factory directors punished workers, but today workers punish factory directors. My ancestors for three generations have never seen such a thing. This handling is fair." Some workers were even moved to tears. What reason do we have not to believe in the masses of workers? At the same time, it also tells us that as long as we consult with the masses, study and discuss together, the problem will be better resolved, as evidenced by the solving of the embezzlement case and the handling policy of this incident. These facts have well corrected our subjective, arrogant, and conceited ideological style of not relying on the workers.
    This error also once again educated us on the importance of asking for instructions and reporting, and the danger of being unorganized and undisciplined. After the general branch learned about the incident in the Second Factory, it reported to the Municipal Party Committee for instructions and organized a working group to go to the Second Factory to understand the situation and investigate the truth, and at the same time, carry out education work. Only then did it determine to distinguish between right and wrong, clarify responsibilities, and adopt the mediation method to unite and educate all the factory's employees. With the united efforts of the Party, the government, and the trade union, and relying on the efforts of all the workers, the problem was properly resolved.
    We have issued a circular on this incident as a learning material for Party member cadres, and we plan to communicate and discuss it among Party members, and conduct an ideological review among comrades from the old revolutionary base areas to prevent similar incidents from happening again. We must strengthen our study, especially the study of democratic management of enterprises and the Party's policies, government laws and decrees, and trade union work, otherwise, we will be satisfied with the past history, or satisfied with the current situation. This is a dangerous idea of ​​standing still, which should arouse our deep attention and high vigilance! Because it is not as obvious as that kind of hedonistic and corrupt lifestyle. At the same time, it often happens to comrades who are working hard and busily, and it is not easy to detect on weekdays, and the leadership is also easy to overlook. This requires our Party workers to pay attention to the ideological situation of Party members at all times in order to prevent its growth and spread.

　　高兆庆崔道生的错误的教训
    中共北京电信局总支委员会
    我们同意并接受三月十四日人民日报党的生活栏对我们的批评与建议，并将我们所总结的经验教训公开发表，供同志们参考。
    电信局第二电机修配厂连续发生盗窃事件，高兆庆、崔道生二同志不依靠群众深入调查，而非法地软禁工友戴聘珍，并搜查工友宿舍，事先既不请示，事后又不报告，脱离群众违犯政策法纪，造成了侵犯人权的严重错误，忘记了一个共产党员应当恪守人民政府法律，作奉公守法的模范。也表现了对党的政策缺乏学习，对组织纪律认识不足，对群众的提醒不予重视。
    高、崔二同志犯错误的基本原因是思想上的保守，和对新鲜事物缺乏学习。高兆庆、崔道生都是抗日战争初期参加人民解放军工作的干部，十余年来在军工厂内，兢兢业业，克服困难，埋头苦干，从不计较个人得失，努力为人民服务，且有较好成就，完成了当时军事环境中的生产任务。进城以来，一方面保持了艰苦朴素的作风，但另一方面在思想意识与工作作风上却存在着简单化的工作方式，散漫性与游击习气，这种作风在过去也是错误的，而他一直没有改正，还搬用到今天的企业管理上来。这一次错误的发生就是由此而来的。甚至虽已犯了严重的侵犯人权的错误，而当时他自己还不知道。他不知道运用民主方式来管理公营企业，而习惯于命令式的、各自为政的工作方法。虽然该厂工厂管理委员会成立很久，但他们对工厂管理委员会的意义并未了解，因之产生了独立行动，对民主管理盲目地怠工，并自以为是。他只空洞的知道依靠工人，但实际作起来是脱离工人，忽视了工会组织与工人利益，擅自搜查、软禁工会会员，更严重的是他当时还认为这是“小事情”。这应引起我们老同志严重警惕！除深刻的检查思想行动以外，要面对现实，认真学习，向周围的同志学习，向工人学习。
    高、崔二同志的错误，一方面固然由于该两同志本身思想作风问题，另一方面我们总支领导上在新情况下对这两同志的帮助教育启发引导也不够。我们领导工作不深入，未能及时发现其思想错误，更没有积极设法和防止这一事件的产生。
    这一事件又告诉了我们群众的意见是正确的。例如当我们进行了调查，分析了错误的原因性质，提出了两个处理方案（按法律手续处理或者调解）的时候，工人们都同意采用调解方式。又如当高、崔在大会上诚恳的承认错误，并要求大家帮助他，监督他改正错误的时候，当场工人说：“只要讲清是非，明确了责任，我们没有意见。”也有工人说：“过去厂长处罚工人，今天工人处罚厂长，我祖宗三代还未见过这样的事，这样处理是公道的。”甚至有的工人感动的流下了眼泪。我们有什么理由不相信工人群众呢？同时又告诉了我们凡事只要和群众商量，研究讨论一块去办，问题就得到较好的效果，像这一次丢款的破案，与对这一事件的处理方针，就是明证。这些事实很好地纠正了我们不依靠工人的主观主义妄自尊大的思想作风。
    这一错误也再一次的教育了我们认识请示报告的重要性和无组织无纪律的危险性。总支知道了二厂发生事件即报告市委请示，并组织工作组到二厂了解情况调查事实真像，同时进行教育工作，然后才确定分清是非，明确责任，采用调解方式，以团结教育全厂职工。在党、政、工团结一致和依靠全体工人努力下才把问题适当解决。
    我们把这事件发出了通报，作为党员干部的学习资料，并拟在党员中作传达讨论，在老区来的同志中进行一次思想检查，以防类似事件发生。我们要加强学习，尤其是学习企业的民主管理与党的政策，政府法令，以及工会工作等，否则，就会满足过去的历史，或者满足今天的现状。这是一种固步自封的危险思想，应引起我们深切的注意和高度的警惕！因为它不像那种享乐腐化的生活作风那样明显。同时它又常常发生在辛辛苦苦忙忙碌碌的同志们身上，平时不易发觉，领导上也容易忽视，这就要求我们党的工作者，要时时注意党员们的思想情况，才能防止它的滋长与蔓延。
