　　From a Linguistic Perspective: Mayor Nie's and Deputy Mayor Zhang's Two Reports
    Luo Changpei
    Language is a reflection of consciousness, and consciousness is determined by objective facts. Therefore, anyone who proceeds from a materialist viewpoint and is able to be pragmatic will never exaggerate or overstate things. After listening to Mayor Nie's and Deputy Mayor Zhang's two reports, I am even more convinced of this belief.
    Since participating in the First Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, I have felt that our current government "speaks after doing," not "speaks without doing"; it believes that "good governance lies not in excessive talk." The former reactionary governments, from the emperors of past dynasties to Yuan Shikai, Li Yuanhong, Xu Shichang, Chiang Kai-shek, and others, all employed "literary sycophants" to embellish their rule and exaggerate their achievements, in order to consolidate their reactionary rule and continue to oppress the people. Their documents were filled with benevolence, caring for the people; in reality, they "said all the right things but did all the wrong things!" This is an example of words not matching deeds, of exaggeration.
    Now, our own government, which truly represents the people, has a completely different style. The achievements of 1949 are evident to all two million citizens of Beijing and need no further elaboration. Looking at the 1950 work plan and the budget estimate reports, the words fully reveal a materialist spirit of "words must be trusted, and actions must be resolute!"
    Mayor Nie's report begins by saying: "In this year (1949), we made great efforts and achieved considerable success in destroying the remaining reactionary forces, establishing and consolidating the revolutionary order, restoring and developing the production of public and private industries and agriculture, and developing the people's cultural and educational undertakings. In terms of municipal construction, although limited by manpower and financial resources, it was impossible to build much, but some necessary work was done. Our 1950 work plan is based on the work and achievements of 1949 and is formulated by comparatively accurately estimating the financial strength and all objective conditions of 1950." This is truly telling the truth as it is, without boasting or false modesty. It takes into account the true "financial strength" and "objective conditions" everywhere. Looking at the five projects in the plan: "(1) Continue to consolidate the revolutionary order, (2) Vigorously restore and develop production, (3) Appropriately develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings that serve the working people; (4) Carry out necessary municipal construction work with a focus; (5) Implement measures to relieve unemployment and other related welfare measures in a planned manner." The wording of each item is carefully considered and very measured. "Continue" means that we must strengthen our vigilance and carry the revolution through to the end; "vigorously" means that restoring and developing production is the overriding central task, so "the proportion of production investment or loans is the largest" in the budget estimates of various undertakings; the terms "appropriately," "with a focus," and "in a planned manner" precisely indicate that these undertakings must all consider financial strength and objective conditions and prioritize what is necessary. If we think carefully, is there a single point in this plan that is exaggerated?
    In Deputy Mayor Zhang's report on the budget estimates, he first stated: "This draft budget is based on the financial revenue and expenditure situation and experience of 1949, as well as the annual work plans of various departments of the Municipal People's Government for 1950, and has been compiled after repeated discussions, repeated revisions, and relatively accurate calculations. Therefore, it is based on facts, close to reality, relatively reliable, and has a considerable guarantee of implementation. However, the budget is ultimately a budget and not the final account. In practice, it will of course be subject to some changes based on the specific situation." Later, he said: "The basic spirit of this draft budget is: on the one hand, strive to basically guarantee the completion of the 1950 work plan; on the other hand, strive to basically achieve financial self-sufficiency." His conclusion is: "Ensure that what is 'taken from the people' is definitely 'used for the people,' and what is 'used for the people' must necessarily be 'taken from the people!'" Such careful consideration of wording avoids the problem that Lu Ji described as "intention not matching the object, words not conveying the meaning." This kind of language reflects correct consciousness; and this consciousness originates from concrete things and objective conditions. As for the various items in the budget, they are even more undoubtedly real things!
    I have been a Chinese language teacher and also a professor of linguistics. However, my motive for writing this short article is not to display the pedantic fussiness of a Chinese language teacher; but to prove from the standpoint of a linguist that anyone who proceeds from a materialist viewpoint and is able to be pragmatic will absolutely not exaggerate!

　　从语言观点看聂市长和张副市长的两个报告
    罗常培
    语言是意识的反映，意识是由客观事实决定的。因此，凡是从唯物观点出发，能够实事求是的人，绝不会信口夸张，言过其实。听了聂市长和张副市长的两个报告，格外使我坚定了这个信念。
    从参加北京市第一届各界代表会议起，我就感觉到：我们现在的政府是“做了后说”，不是“说了不做”的；是“为政不在多言”的。从前的反动政府从历代专制帝王，以至于袁世凯、黎元洪、徐世昌、蒋介石等，都豢养了一些“文学侍从之臣”，专替他们粉饰太平，夸张政绩，为是巩固他们的反动统治，继续压迫人民。满纸的仁心仁政，保民爱民；其实是“好话说尽，坏事做尽！”这就是言不顾行，言过其实的例子。
    现在咱们自己的、真正能代表人民的政府，作风就完全不同了。一九四九一年间的施政成绩，是全北京市二百万市民共见共闻的，用不着再多说；专就一九五○年工作计划和财政收支概算两个报告来看，字里行间充分地流露着“言必信，行必果”的唯物精神！
    聂市长的报告一开头儿就说：“在这一年（一九四九）中，我们在摧毁残余的反动势力，建立和巩固革命秩序，恢复和发展公私营工业和农业的生产，以及发展人民的文化教育事业上，曾经作了很大的努力，也曾获得不小的成绩。在市政建设方面，虽为人力财力所限制，不可能多所建树，但也做了一些必要的工作。我们的一九五○年工作计划就是以一九四九年的工作及其成绩为基础，并比较精确地估计了一九五○年度财政力量和一切客观条件而拟订的”。这真是实话实说，不作吹嘘的夸张，也没有虚伪的客气。处处顾到真实的“财政力量”和“客观的条件”。再从计划中的五个项目来看：“（一）继续巩固革命秩序，（二）大力恢复和发展生产，（三）适当发展为劳动人民服务的文教卫生事业；（四）有重点地进行必要的市政建设工作，（五）有计划地采取救济失业及其他有关福利的措施”。各项的措词也是字斟句酌，极有分寸的。“继续”就是叫咱们加强警惕把革命进行到底；“大力”就是把恢复和发展生产做为压倒一切的中心任务，因此在各种事业费的概算中，“生产投资或贷款所占比例最大”；所谓“适当”、“有重点地”、“有计划地”也正是说明这些事业都得估计财政力量和客观条件，先拣必要的去做。咱们仔细想一想，在这个计划里可有一钉点儿言过其实的地方？
    在张副市长关于财政收支概算的报告中，首先说明：“这个概算草案是根据一九四九年度的财政收支状况和经验以及一九五○年度市人民政府各部门的全年工作计划，经过反复研讨，一再修改，比较精确地计算后编成的。因此，它是有根据的，接近实际的，比较可靠的，实行起来有相当保证的。但概算究竟是概算而不等于决算，在实行中，当然还会根据具体情况，有些变动。”随后又说：“这个概算草案的基本精神是：一方面，争取基本上保证一九五○年度工作计划的完成；他方面，争取基本上做到财政上自给。”他的总结是：“务使‘取之于民’的，一定‘用之于民’，而‘用之于民’的，也势须‘取之于民’！”像这样斟酌字句，绝没有陆机所说：“意不称物，言不逮意”的毛病。这种语言文字反映着正确的意识；而这种意识都发自具体事物和客观条件。至于概算里的各项那更是千真万确的实在的东西了！
    我做过国文教员，同时也是语言学教授。可是我写这篇短文的动机，并不是发挥国文教员咬文嚼字的酸气；而是从语言学家的地位来证明：凡是从唯物观点出发，能够实事求是的人，绝对不会言过其实！
