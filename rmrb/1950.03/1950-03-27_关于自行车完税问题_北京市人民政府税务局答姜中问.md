Regarding Bicycle Tax Payment Issues
    Reply from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau to Jiang Zhong

To the Editor:

    In the People's Forum column on March 17th, you published a letter from Jiang Zhong regarding his experience on February 16th when he was processing the shipment of his bicycle at the Qianmen Station. He described the situation when the tax inspection station personnel checked his documents. After our bureau notified the Qianmen Tax Collection Office to investigate, we received a report from the office as follows: On February 16th, when Jiang Zhong went to the station to ship his bicycle, a staff member from the inspection station asked him if he had paid the vehicle license tax. He replied that it was newly purchased. He was then asked if he had an invoice and whether the goods tax had been paid. Jiang Zhong presented the tax receipt for inspection. Because the destination on the tax receipt did not match the destination of shipment (the tax receipt stated Zhangjiakou, while he was shipping to Xin'an), the staff member asked him to go to the Third Branch Bureau of Taxation to correct the destination on the tax receipt. At that time, he said that since the tax had already been paid, what did it matter if the destination matched or not. The staff member told him that this was a necessary procedure. He seemed to find it troublesome and called the porter to explain. To facilitate his shipment and considering that the Third Branch Bureau might still be on holiday for the Spring Festival, the staff member suggested that he go to the Second Office of the Qianmen Inspection Station, which was closer, to apply for a change of destination. As Comrade Jiang was leaving, the staff members discussed the matter among themselves, and Zheng Chunhua said, "This can be handled flexibly, let him go." This statement was overheard by Jiang Zhong, who then returned to the room and questioned whether tax laws could be "handled flexibly." The staff member then provided an explanation. Jiang Zhong's expression of his opinion is a great help to us, and we welcome it very much. We have convened all staff members of the East Station Inspection Station and conducted a review. Zheng Chunhua's statement about "flexible handling" reflects a misunderstanding of tax laws and has been criticized. Our answers to the issues raised by Jiang Zhong are as follows:

    1. If a bicycle purchased in Beijing is not used for riding in Beijing, it is not necessary to pay the vehicle license tax in Beijing. However, when shipping a bicycle to another location, the inspector cannot know whether the bicycle has been ridden in Beijing. Therefore, during inspection, it is customary to first ask if the tax has been paid. After it is explained that the bicycle is newly purchased, one will then be asked if they have an invoice and whether the goods tax has been paid. This intention is purely to check for tax evasion and does not mean that a bicycle purchased in Beijing must pay the vehicle license tax in Beijing.

    2. Does the Qianmen Inspection Station have the power to "flexibly handle" the collection of vehicle license tax? Not only can this tax not be "handled flexibly," but all other taxes must also be handled in accordance with tax laws, tax items, and tax rates. There is absolutely no room for "flexible handling."

    3. If the items filled in on the tax receipt do not match the actual situation, or if the procedures are incomplete, shipment cannot be processed according to regulations. Otherwise, once the tax authorities at the destination discover it, the tax authorities at the point of origin will be held responsible for the oversight, and the shipper will be subject to penalties for violating regulations. Therefore, if the destination on the tax receipt does not match, the inspector should instruct the shipper to declare a correction to the original issuing authority.

    4. The tax receipt should accompany the vehicle only to a certain extent. If a new vehicle is shipped from Location A to Location B and remains unused, retaining its original newness, when it is shipped from Location B to Location C in the future and declared to the tax authorities, the original tax receipt must be presented as proof that the goods tax has been paid. If the new vehicle has been used and has lost its original newness, the goods tax is not levied, and there is no need to keep the original tax receipt. As for the destination and time limit on the tax receipt, they are filled in based on the situation declared by the taxpayer at the time. After the passage of time, no tax authority will rigidly base its decisions on the past destination and time limit to restrict the destination and time limit requested by the shipper.

    As for the Third Branch Bureau levying tax on Jiang Zhong's bicycle at the original purchase price plus 50,000 yuan, this was based on the taxable price determined by investigating and understanding the general market price, and there is nothing inappropriate about it. It is a good thing that Jiang Zhong was able to bring up the situation he experienced during the inspection at the station. This not only helps us understand the work of lower-level staff but also helps these staff members improve. We are very grateful.

### 关于自行车完税问题  北京市人民政府税务局答姜中问

　　关于自行车完税问题
    北京市人民政府税务局答姜中问编辑同志：
    人民园地三月十七日登出姜中所写他二月十六日在前门站办理托运自行车，对税务稽查站工作人员查验时的情况的信。经我局通知前门稽征所调查，兹据该所报告：二月十六日姜中到站托运自行车，由稽查站工作干部问他是否有车捐？据答系新买的。又问他有无发票，是否上过货物税？姜中当将税票取出交验。因验看税票运达地点不符（税票上是运张家口而他托运新保安），工作干部让他到税务第三分局改正税票上的运达地点，当时他说既已上过税，运达地点是否相符有什么关系。工作干部告诉他这是应办的手续，他似嫌麻烦，当把车行人召来解释。工作干部为便利他的托运，并想到当时三分局可能尚在春节休假中，故让他到较近的前门稽征所第二办公处去声请改运。在姜同志出门时，工作干部们互相谈论这件事，郑春华说了句“这是可以灵活运用的，就让他走吧。”这话被姜中听见，遂返回屋中诘问税法可以“灵活运用”吗？当由工作干部予以解释。现在姜中提出意见，这是对我们很好的帮助，我们非常欢迎。我们已召集东车站稽查站全体工作干部，作了检讨。郑春华所说“灵活运用”一语，对税法的认识是错误的，已予批评。对于姜中提出的问题，我们的解答如下：
    一、在北京买的自行车，不在北京骑用，是不用在北京交纳使用牌照税的。不过向外埠运自行车，该车是否在北京骑过，查验人是不知道的。所以在查验时习惯上多是先问是否上税，经说明系新买的以后，再问有无发票，有无上过货物税。这种意思纯为稽查是否漏税，并不等于说在北京买的自行车，必须在北京上使用牌照税。
    二、前门稽查站有没有“灵活运用”征收使用牌照税的权力。不仅对此税不能“灵活运用”，其他任何各税都必须依照税法税目税率办理，决无“灵活运用”余地。
    三、凡是税票上填写的项目与实际情况不符，或是手续不完备的，照章不能办理托运。否则一经运达地点税务机关查获，起运地点税务机关须负失查的责任，运货人须受违章的处理。所以税票上运达地点不符，查验人员应令运货人向原填发机关声明更正。
    四、税票要跟着车子走，是有一定限度的。新车由甲地运至乙地后，如果并未使用，仍旧保持原来的新度，将来由乙地欲运往丙地而向税务机关报运时，须持有原税票，以为完过货物税之证明。如新车已经使用，失去原来的新度，则不课征货物税，自无保存原税票之必要。至于税票上的运达地点和运达期限，均系根据纳税人当时声请的情况所填写。在将来时过境迁之后，无论任何税务机关决不会呆板的根据过去的地点和期限，来限制报运人要求运达的地点和期限。
    至第三分局对姜中自行车按原买价加五万元征税，系根据调查了解市场一般市价所核定的完税价格办理的，尚无不合之处。姜中能把这次在车站报验经过情况提出来，这是很好的事。这不仅帮助了我们对下层工作干部的了解，并且也帮助了这些工作干部的进步，我们很表感谢。
