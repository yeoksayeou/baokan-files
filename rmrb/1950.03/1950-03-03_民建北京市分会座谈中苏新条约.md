Participants included preparatory committee members from the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, promoting committee members from the Minjian General Association, and directors and supervisors from the Beijing Branch, including Peng Yihu, Ling Qijun, and representatives from the Grain Company and Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, totaling 57 people. Ling Qijun presided. More than ten people, including Tang Qingyong and Chen Yintang, spoke enthusiastically. Everyone unanimously agreed that the signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty strengthened and consolidated the power of the world peace camp. After summarizing everyone's common opinions, Ling Qijun pointed out that the actual value of the first loan amount this year is approximately equal to the total amount of the first phase of the People's Victory Discounted Public Bonds.
