　　Yesterday, I watched Mr. Shang Xiaoyun's self-written and directed "Mo Dai," which evoked some scattered thoughts that I wanted to write down and discuss with friends who are reforming old operas. Due to my limited knowledge of old operas, I only intend to discuss the structure of "Mo Dai" and the success or shortcomings of its scenery and "effects" in this short article, as a reference for how to critically accept the legacy of old operas and reform them.

　　The beginning of this play does not make irrelevant expositions outside the central issue. It directly touches upon the center of the problem from Mang Jitu's dialogue at the very beginning. The first scene features the golden plaque representing the order to execute Mo Dai's entire family, quickly unfolding the story's entanglements and immediately making the audience concerned about the fate of Mo Dai's family, eagerly wanting to know how the problem will develop. This indeed grasps the characteristics of dramatic art; it can also be said to be appropriately utilizing the special methods of old opera. This concise and straightforward expression is unlike the general stream-of-consciousness scripts, where the audience cannot discern what the author wants to present after a long period of singing. Instead, it brings the issue to the audience's attention from the outset. If this direct narrative style lacks variation and becomes monotonous and dull, it is not good. However, as drama, especially drama for mass appreciation, as long as it grasps the ups and downs of the specific event's development, it will not be monotonous or become a rigid formula.

　　Is the direct style of "Mo Dai" a flat narration? No, it has a lot of variation in many places. The family meeting presided over by Mo Dai's father (Pingzhang Lu Wenda) in the second scene is not about the fear before the impending disaster, but rather the joy of yearning for another life. The issue that aroused the audience's concern in the previous scene with the golden plaque seems to be diluted here, but it is precisely because of this that it attracts the audience's attention even more. This joy of yearning for another life serves as a foil for the horror before the impending disaster. Emphasizing the Lu family's dream of happiness precisely creates a sudden stimulus for the "something terrible has happened" warning, thus particularly attracting the audience's concern. Mr. Shang Xiaoyun, who pays special attention to the cadence of singing, handles the second scene with a tight-loose, catch-and-release approach, which is not accidental and is worth learning from.

　　This script possesses another new atmosphere in the process of narrating events – it does not put every plot point on the stage. Although triviality and digressions are not necessarily the faults of all old operas, many old operas do have this problem. And "Mo Dai," although it has not avoided this problem everywhere, has avoided this problem in many places. For example, the execution of Lu Wenda's entire family, Mo Dai's changing clothes in the Jinwu Guard Yamen hall, the meeting between Jin Chang and Dongfang Sou in the mountain village, the beating to death of Da Feng in the Xiangfu Garden, and the killing of Mang Jitu's son are all explained through dialogue or the delivery of a head. Although these details are not specifically explained, they do not hinder the audience from understanding the entire plot. On the contrary, because these unimportant digressions are not specifically explained, the drama gains simplicity and does not disrupt the development of the central issue's thread.

　　Another advantage of "Mo Dai" in structure is repetition.

　　In old opera, repetition is a good technique. For example, in "Four Scholars," the oath at the Double Pagoda Temple is recalled by the scholars on various occasions. The wording is generally the same, but it does not seem long-winded. The petition is also well-treated in this play. Mao Peng, Song Shijie, and Gu Du all read the petition. The people reading the petition are different, and their roles are different, but the petition is the same. Tian Lun's private letter is read to her sister when she writes it, Song Shijie reads it to himself when he secretly looks at it, and Mao Peng reads it to the criminal when he tries the case. There is only one private letter, but it is read three times in different circumstances by different characters. The repeated questioning of the two sons in "Lotus Lantern" and the repeated mention of the ungrateful son's whereabouts in "Qingfeng Pavilion" all involve repetition with variation and variation in repetition. These repeatedly appearing techniques are not limited to dialogue. They also exist widely in many gestures and stage steps. Of course, some actors who do not know how to use this technique can make the script seem long-winded, but often this technique of repetition with variation seems more powerful. It deepens the audience's concern for the theme; it strengthens the audience's attraction to the development of the entanglements; it makes important things particularly prominent, adding weight to the impression; it creates a corresponding effect and seeks harmony in the entire play. "Mo Dai" is developing this strength in this aspect. For example, in the first scene, Mang Jitu mentions that he "harbors resentment" because he cannot obtain Mo Dai, and he uses the execution of the entire family to achieve his goal; Lu Wenda also repeats this reason of "harboring resentment" and determines his own countermeasures. This "harboring resentment" is the beginning of the event and the guiding thread of the entire play, and it is necessary to appear repeatedly. In the third scene, Mang Jitu, in the Jinwu Guard Yamen, calls out "Mo Dai" three times in front of the heroine who is disguised as a yamen servant. Not only does the shuddering shoulder of Mo Dai, who is disguised as a yamen servant, reveal the danger, but the repeated calling out of the name itself possesses an amazing power. The three calls are repetitive, and the effect of each one being tighter than the last is not the same. It repeats, yet does not repeat; because it enhances the dramatic effect, this repetition is very popular with the audience.

　　But is the structure of this script without shortcomings? It has shortcomings, very serious ones. In some places, when using variation techniques, it produces extremely scattered and disorganized problems. The most prominent problem is manifested in the scene where Da Feng grinds tofu. As a component of the theme, what role does this scene play? It is simply superfluous and wasteful. Although some audiences applauded the real chickens appearing on stage, and although some audiences were interested in Mr. Shang Changlin's imitation of the stage steps of a rural woman with bound feet; in any case, it cannot be said that this scene is successful. This is because it is irrelevant to the development of the entire event and useless for expressing the theme. This scene takes up a full ten minutes, for no reason, because of fetching beans, fetching water, sending pulp, and leaving the stage empty three times. Due to this ten minutes of long-windedness, the thread of the entire play is interrupted and broken. Its description of the life of rural women is superficial, and the audience has completely forgotten the issue of Mo Dai's fate at this time. This unskillful scene became independent, and it is not just a branch that has neither too much nor too little; rather, it is a tumor that is harmful instead of helpful. Some viewers suspect: I don't know what the intention of the writers and directors was when they used this scene to waste time?

　　In old opera, there are two situations of using details with different successes and failures. One is that in "Hongni Pass," Madame Dongfang plays with a colored ball, and in "Picking up the Jade Bracelet," Sun Yujiao makes shoes. If the actors understand how to portray the psychology of the characters, although it takes a lot of time on these details, it does not seem superfluous, because it is very useful for the psychological depiction of longing or spring reverie. This is good. The other is that they do not understand the role of details in the entire event or character portrayal, deviate from the theme, and focus on details for the sake of details, wasting a lot of time, but it is of no use to the elucidation of the theme. These details, which are irrelevant to the theme and distract the audience, are sometimes the responsibility of the actor and sometimes the responsibility of the playwright. Like the scene of grinding tofu, even a good actor cannot remedy its failure. Skilled actors can only ask patient audiences to appreciate the skills of acting, but cannot ask the audience to care more about the development of the plot. If the audience's attention to the central issue has been aroused in the front, it is diluted here. If it is said that this scene of grinding tofu is similar to the weaknesses of some old operas, then when reforming old operas, these weaknesses must be discarded. In order to consider the effect of moving the audience, and in order not to tire the audience but to educate the audience in entertainment, it is necessary to grasp the theme more tightly and not to damage the simplicity of the drama with these scenes unrelated to the theme. Do not misunderstand variation and forcibly piece together these branches that damage the theme.

　　A similar shortcoming to grinding tofu also exists in the scene of poisoning and beating Da Feng in the Xiangfu Garden. When exposing the ugliness of the Xiangye father and son, what do the audience get? -- Amusement. These details dilute the audience's due hatred for the treacherous father and son and their sympathy for Da Feng. If these interjections are not carefully considered, they will often violate the original intention of the playwright and create bad effects.

　　The reason for the problem of producing inappropriate handling of details cannot but be said to be insufficient critical ability to absorb heritage. It may also be related to the writers and directors' views on the Xiangye father and son fighting for favor; and not recognizing what the main evils of these characters are; and related to catering to the old traditions of low-level tastes. Regarding this, it is worth pondering by friends who are reforming old operas. At the same time, I also hope that Mr. Shang Xiaoyun, who takes doing plays seriously, will consider the retention or treatment that should be given to this kind of plot from the perspective of the real publicity and education effect when arranging other new plays.

　　The opinion on the structure stops here, and I will incidentally talk about the use of so-called mechanical scenery, real props, and "effects."

　　The use of mechanical scenery and real props in old opera has been opposed by some people, who believe that opera can only rely on the acting skills of the actors to convey the plot without using scenery to help; but due to the love of the masses, this conservative traditional view has not persuaded reformers to make bold attempts, but has instead developed further. Of course, if the main acting skills are neglected and rely on mechanical scenery, that is a manifestation of impure motives; but if the scenery is appropriate, does not affect the characters because of the long-winded background, and does not destroy the simplicity of the drama, then it is not a shortcoming of "waijiang" but progress, worthy of attention. The scenery heavily used in "Mo Dai," generally speaking, does not have big problems. On the contrary, it enhances the persuasiveness of the drama. In particular, the scenery in the second scene is very harmonious and can greatly assist the plot. Even more gratifying is that this play has achieved great success in using the curtain to change scenes, which makes the connection between scenes closer, more natural, and cleaner.

　　"Mo Dai" is not absolutely without problems in this regard. For example, in the snow scene, the change in the light in the morning and evening, and the brilliance of the morning sun, somewhat overwhelm the main subject, damaging the simplicity of the drama. As for the real chickens appearing on stage, which distract the audience, they are even more unworthy of praise as props. How to use scenery and props more appropriately and artistically in opera is still a question worthy of further investigation by those who are reforming old operas.

　　Finally, I would like to mention the use of the spoken drama-style "effects" in "Mo Dai." Using a loudspeaker to explain the plot in the middle of the performance is a new method. But I think it is a failure. Is it impossible to explain the plot conveniently without relying on this method? No; because the plot can be explained through the development of the story and the singing and dialogue of the actors. Now, suddenly adding some modern electrical appliances in addition to the actors, what is the necessity? I think this interjection is superfluous and meaningless. In terms of opera, this is a way to destroy its integrity and destroy harmony. Secondly, it is also worth considering whether stylized opera must use natural sounds of chicken crows in the style of spoken drama. Is it necessary to use this less harmonious natural sound to enhance the persuasiveness of opera? No. In operas where dialogue, stage steps, and costumes are all stylized, sounds such as horses neighing are represented by wind instruments and trumpets, which is exactly how music handles these "effects." Is it necessary for "Mo Dai" to break this habit of old opera and use this natural sound in order to increase artistic variation? It is not necessarily so. In short, it is correct to use percussion instruments to increase the effect and use natural sounds of "effects" in other places in this opera. The effect of natural sounds can be used in opera, but the current use, which is not harmonious, does not enhance the authenticity of the entire play, but instead seems inharmonious. Rather than forcing it together in this way, it is better to use it less or not at all. This is the same as the reform of traditional Chinese painting. If the standard of reform is set as Western painting and aimed at Western painting, it will damage the proper development of new traditional Chinese painting. Reforming old opera improperly by looking to spoken drama and abandoning what is worth preserving or even developing in old opera is not a proper method of innovation. The improper use of these methods in "Mo Dai" is an imperfection.

### 从尚小云的“墨黛”  谈旧剧的结构布景与“效果”问题

　　从尚小云的“墨黛”
    谈旧剧的结构布景与“效果”问题
    甘驭
    昨天看了尚小云先生自编自导的“墨黛”，引起了一些零碎的感想，想写它出来，和改革旧戏的朋友们商讨。由于笔者对于旧剧的知识有限，在这篇短文中只打算谈谈“墨黛”的结构以及布景与“效果”的成功或缺点，作为如何批判地接受旧剧遗产，与改革旧剧的参考。
    这个剧本的开始，不在中心问题之外做无关紧要的铺叙。一开场就从莽吉图的道白里直截了当的接触到问题的中心，第一场就出现了代表抄斩墨黛全家命令的金牌，迅速展开了故事的纠葛，让观众立刻对墨黛全家的命运关心，急切的要知道问题如何发展。这，确是把握了戏剧艺术的特点；也可以说是恰当的利用了旧剧的特殊方式的。这种简练明快的表现方式，它不像一般流水账式的剧本，演唱了半天也看不出作者要向观众提出什么问题；而是一开头就把问题提到观众面前的。这种开门见山的叙述方式，如果由于缺乏变化，流于单调乏味，那是不好的；但作为戏剧，特别是给大众欣赏的戏剧，只要抓住具体事件发展过程的起伏变化，就不会单调也不会成为死板公式。
    开门见山式的“墨黛”，是不是平铺直叙呢？不，它在好些地方，很有变化。第二场墨黛父亲（平章鲁文达）所主持的家庭会议，不是大祸将临前的恐惧而是向往另一种生活的愉悦。前一场由金牌引起观众关心的问题，在这里似乎被冲淡了，但正因为如此，更吸引观众为他们关心。这向往另一生活的愉悦，正是为了大祸将临前的惊恐作了反衬。强调鲁家幸福的梦想，正是为了给“大事不好了”的警告造成突如其来的刺激，因而特别吸引观众关心。在唱工上特别注意抑扬的尚小云先生，用紧中有慢、欲擒故纵的方式来处理第二场戏，不是偶然的，是值得学习的。
    这剧本在事件的叙述过程中，它具备着另一种新的气象——不把什么情节都搬上舞台。虽然说繁琐和枝节不一定是所有旧戏的毛病，但好多旧戏都有这毛病。而“墨黛”，虽然没有处处都避免了这种毛病，但好些地方都避免了这种毛病。比如鲁文达全家被斩，墨黛金吾卫衙门大堂换装，金昌山寨会东方叟，相府花园打死大凤，莽吉图的儿子被杀等等，都是只用道白交代，人头交代的。这些细节虽不具体交代，却不妨碍观众了解全部剧情；相反的，因为没有具体交代这些不重要的枝节，因而获得了戏剧的单纯，不破坏中心问题的发展线索。
    墨黛在结构上另一好处，是重复。
    在旧戏里，重复是一种很好的手法。比如“四进士”的双塔寺盟誓，进士们在各种场合加以回忆，那词句大体相同，但不显得噜囌。状子，在这戏里也很受优待，写状的毛朋念，宋士杰念，顾读念。念状人不同，作用不同，但状子是一个。田伦的私信，写信时念给姐姐听，偷看信的宋士杰念给自己听，审案的毛朋念给罪犯听，私信只有一封，但在不同人物不同情况下念了三次。“宝莲灯”的反复考问两儿，“青风亭”的反复提到忘恩儿子的去路，都是在变化中有重复，在重复中求变化的。这些反复出现的手法，不止于道白。在很多手势上，台步上也普遍存在。诚然，有些不会使用这种手法的演员会使得剧本噜囌，但常常，这种重复中有变化的手法更显得有力。它加深观众对于主题的关心；它加强观众对于纠葛发展的吸引力；它使重要事物特别突出，加重印象；它造成了照应的作用而求得全剧的和谐。“墨黛”，在这一方面是发扬这种特长的。比如第一场莽吉图提到因为墨黛不能到手而他自己“怀恨在心”，用抄斩全家来达到目的；鲁文达也重复这一“怀恨在心”的原因，而定出自己的对策。这“怀恨在心”是事件的开端，是全剧的引线，反复出现，很必要。第三场莽吉图在金吾卫衙门里，当着化装成衙役的女主角冒叫三声“墨黛”，不仅由于化装成衙役的墨黛一耸吃惊的肩头而显示出危险，这重复三声的冒叫本身，就具备着惊人的力量。三声冒叫是重复的，一次紧似一次的作用又不是雷同的。它重复，又不重复；因为它加强了戏剧的效果，所以这重复很受观众欢迎。
    但是这个剧本的结构是不是没有缺点呢？有缺点，很严重。它在某些地方使用变化手法时，产生了极其散漫和零乱的毛病。顶突出的毛病表现在大凤磨豆腐那一场。作为主题的组成部分，这一场有什么作用呢？简直是多余的，浪费的。虽然某些观众对于上台的真鸡拍手叫好，虽然某些观众对于尚长麟先生那种模仿乡下小脚女子的台步感到兴趣；不论如何，不能不说这一场戏是失败的。因为它对于整个事件的发展无关，对于主题的表达无益。这一场戏足足花费了十分钟，毫无理由的，因为取豆子、取水、送浆、使舞台空了三次。由于这十分钟的噜囌，全剧的线索中断了破碎了。它对农村女子的生活描写是肤浅的，观众在这时已经完全忘记了墨黛命运的问题。这场不高明的戏闹了独立性，它不仅是有它不多无它不少的枝节，而是有了反而有害的赘瘤。有些观众怀疑：不知道编导者是什么动机出发，而用这一场戏来浪费时间？
    在旧戏里，有两种成败不同的运用细节的情况。一种是“虹霓关”东方夫人玩彩球，“拾玉镯”里孙玉姣做鞋，如果是懂得角色心理应该如何刻划的演员，虽然化费很多时间，在这些细节上，它不显得多余，因为它于相思或思春的心理描写很有作用。这是好的。另一种是不懂细节对于整个事件或性格刻画的作用，离开主题，为细节而细节，浪费很多时间，可是于主题的阐发毫无作用。这种与主题无关的，分散观众注意力的细节，有时该演员负责，有时该剧作者负责。像磨豆腐这一场，好演员也不能补救它的失败。有技巧的演员只能叫耐心的观众玩赏做戏的技巧，不能叫观众更关心剧情的发展。如果在前面曾经激起观众对于中心问题的注意，在这里就冲淡了应有的注意。如果说磨豆腐这场戏相同于某些旧戏的弱点，在改革旧戏的时候，就必须抛弃这弱点。为了从感动观众的效果着想，为了不是疲劳观众而是在娱乐中教育观众，必须更紧的抓住主题，不要以这些与主题无关的场面而损害了戏剧的单纯。不要误解变化，生硬的拼凑这些损害主题的枝节。
    和磨豆腐类似的缺点，在相府花园毒打大凤那一场也同样存在。暴露相爷父子的丑态时，给予观众的是什么呢？——逗乐。这些细节冲淡了观众对于奸相父子应有的憎恶与对大凤的同情。这种穿插，如果不严加考虑，往往会违背剧作者的初衷，造成不好的效果。
    产生不适当的处理细节这毛病的原因，不能不说是如何吸取遗产的批判力不足。也可能和编导者对于奸相父子争风吃醋的看法有关；和不认识什么是这些人物的主要罪恶有关；和对于迎合低级趣味的旧传统有关。关于这，是值得改革旧戏的朋友们深思的。同时，也希望做戏认真的尚小云先生，在编排另外的新戏时，从真正的宣传教育效果上考虑这种情节的去留或应给的待遇。
    关于结构的意见止于此，附带说说所谓机关布景、真实道具和“效果”的使用问题。
    旧戏使用机关布景和真实道具曾受到一些人的反对，他们认为歌剧只可以依靠演员的演技来传达情节而不必利用布景帮助；但由于群众的喜爱，这种墨守成规的传统观点，没有说服改革者大胆的尝试，反而更加发展起来。当然，如果忽视了主要的演技而依靠机关布景，那是动机不纯的表现；但如果布景适当，不因为噜囌的背景影响了人物，不破坏戏剧的单纯，那就不是“外江”的缺点而是进步，值得重视的进步。“墨黛”所着重使用的布景，一般的说，毛病并不大，正相反，它增强了戏剧的说服力。特别是第二场的布景，很和谐很能补助剧情。更可喜的是这个戏在利用幕布换景这一点，很有成就，它使得场与场的关联更紧密，更自然，更干净。
    “墨黛”在这方面不是绝对没有问题的，比如走雪一场，在表现早晚的灯光的变化，朝日的光辉，多少有点喧宾夺主的毛病，损害了戏剧的单纯。至于分散观众注意力的真鸡上台之类，更是不值得恭维的道具使用法。在歌剧里如何更恰当更艺术的利用布景和道具，还是值得改革旧戏者进一步推究的问题。
    最后想提一提“墨黛”的话剧式的“效果”使用问题。在演出的中途用扩音机来交代剧情，这方式是新的。但我以为是失败的。不依靠这一方式是不是就不能很方便的交代剧情呢？不会的；因为剧情可以从故事发展与演员的唱白中交代出来。如今忽然在演员之外加上一些现代的电器，有什么必要？我以为这种插白是多余的，没有意义的。以歌剧而论，这是破坏它的完整性的，破坏调和的办法。其次，样式化了的歌剧，是不是必须话剧式的利用自然声的鸡叫，也还值得考虑。是不是非用这种不太和谐的自然声音就不能增强歌剧的说服力呢？不会的。在道白台步服装都样式化了的歌剧里，马叫之类的声音都用管乐器喇叭来代表，正好是音乐的处理着这些“效果”的。“墨黛”是不是必须打破旧戏这种习惯，必须用这种自然声音才能增加艺术上的变化呢？也不见得。总之，这一歌剧在其他地方利用打击乐器以增加效果和使用自然声的“效果”，是对的。自然声音的效果，可以在歌剧上使用，但现在这样不调和的使用，没有增强全剧真实性，反而显得不和谐。与其如此硬凑，还是少用或不用为妙。这和国画改革一样，要是把改革的标准定为洋画，向洋画看齐，那会损害了新国画的正当发展。改革旧戏不适当的向话剧看齐，抛弃了旧戏的值得保留甚至发扬之处，不算恰当的革新的办法。“墨黛”不适当的使用了这些方式，是美中不足的现象。
