　　Winter Literacy Campaign in Northeast and North China Nears Completion
    Six Million Peasants Participate
    Some Winter Schools Transition to Regular People's Schools
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Comprehensive reports indicate that the winter literacy campaign, involving over six million peasants in North China, Northeast China, and East China, is entering its final stage. Arrangements are underway to transition a portion of the winter schools into regular people's schools, laying the groundwork for a widespread literacy movement in the future.
    The current winter literacy work has been carried out extremely broadly. According to incomplete statistics, in the Northeast region, the 27 counties of Lüda, Jilin, and Liaodong, the 21 counties and 3 cities of Liaoxi, the 20 counties and 3 cities of Songjiang, the 24 counties of Heilongjiang, the 18 counties and cities and 25 districts of banners of Rehe, as well as the suburbs of Shenyang, Anshan, and Benxi, there are a total of 40,107 winter schools and 36,471 "炕头" (bedside) groups, with a total enrollment of 3,089,564 people, accounting for a little over 11.5% of the rural population of Northeast China. In the North China region, 100 counties and towns in Hebei Province, the entire Pingyuan Province, and the suburbs of Beijing, a total of 2,064,975 people are participating in winter schools. In Shanxi Province, 10,071 winter schools have been established in 5,246 administrative villages across 44 counties, exceeding the original plan of establishing an average of 1.5 winter schools per administrative village. In the East China region, Shandong Province has over 628,790 people enrolled in winter schools across various counties; nearly 100,000 peasants are participating in winter schools in the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region.
    Generally, all regions have attached great importance to the current winter literacy campaign. Last winter, organizations at the county, district, and village levels were successively organized or established to lead the winter literacy campaign (Winter Literacy Committees or Cultural and Educational Committees), and a large number of winter literacy teachers were trained. Over 18,000 winter literacy teachers were trained in North China, while the Jiaodong region of Shandong alone trained 11,394 people, and 3,854 people were trained in 11 counties in Liaoxi and Liaodong in Northeast China. The curriculum of the training courses included politics, current affairs, production, and cultural construction, and the specific methods of running winter schools were studied. At the same time, extensive publicity and mobilization work was generally carried out among the peasants in various regions, using various meetings at the district and village levels to explain and discuss the winter literacy work; persuasive methods were used to eliminate the peasants' concerns about "耽误生产" (delaying production) by attending winter schools, so that attending winter schools gradually became a conscious demand of the peasants. After the winter schools started, various regions generally paid attention to the inspection and guidance of the winter schools. For example, the Education Department of Shanxi Province and various special districts and counties sent winter literacy guidance and inspection teams to guide the winter literacy work in various regions, help them solve difficulties, correct deviations, and exchange experiences in various regions. In order to solve the difficulty for winter literacy teachers to teach political lessons, the province created a "transmission station" led by the main cadres at the county level and established at the district level, unifying the educational content and teaching methods of the winter literacy political lessons. In Handan Special District of Hebei, counties and districts have established regular inspection systems, and organize winter literacy teachers to gather for regular learning and mutual observation to improve the teaching effectiveness of winter literacy.
    Teaching according to different situations in various regions
    Improve the cultural and political level of the masses
    The educational policy of this winter literacy campaign is relatively clear. Most winter schools have established relatively formal learning systems, and through democratic discussions, established learning pacts and systems for attending classes, asking for leave, roll call, and testing. In terms of teaching content, the old liberated areas generally grasped the peasants' demands for learning culture after they turned over, focusing on cultural science and production technology education; the new areas focused on political education, but did not relax literacy education for young men and women. Most winter schools also pay attention to combining with the local central work, such as combining winter literacy learning groups with firewood chopping, textile, mat weaving, transportation and other groups; or combining teaching in winter literacy to mobilize students to order production plans, explain production relief, land reform, rent reduction and other policies related to the local central work. Therefore, it not only improved the cultural and political level of the masses, but also combined with the vital interests of the masses and promoted the central work. For example, students in the Northeast generally learned 150 characters, and some people learned more than 300 characters. Many counties in Shanxi carried out maternal and child hygiene education through winter literacy schools, and Yushu County trained 75 midwives in winter literacy schools, and Taigu County's Chengjiazhuang combined winter literacy to prevent the prevalence of measles. Dongfeng Village in Hailun County, Northeast China, promoted firewood chopping, fishing and other sideline businesses through winter literacy, and the village's income was more than 18 million Northeast currency in less than 20 days. Through winter literacy, the second bao of Chengnan Township, Kunshan County, Southern Jiangsu, mobilized peasants to speak out and conduct class education, and 68% of the peasants in the whole bao joined the peasant association.
    Combining learning with spring plowing preparation work
    Adjusting the learning organization, paying attention to selecting good teachers
    Currently, spring plowing is about to begin, and various regions have arranged to summarize the experience of the current winter literacy campaign, and transfer some of the winter literacy schools to regular people's schools, in order to lay the foundation for a widespread peasant literacy movement in the future. In some areas of Northeast China, peasant learning has been combined with spring plowing preparation work, explaining the benefits of mutual aid groups in winter literacy schools, introducing new agricultural tools, and mobilizing and organizing peasants to deliver manure, so that production and learning tend to be consistent, and gradually develop seasonal education into regular education. Liaoxi Province also plans to focus on Beizhen, select a district to universally establish cultural stations in various villages, and start literacy education to absorb experience. The Education Department of Hebei Province has instructed various regions to carefully summarize the current winter literacy work, reward model winter literacy schools and model winter literacy teachers; and seize the opportunity to end the winter literacy movement, and in areas where land reform has ended early, mass production has recovered well, and culture is more developed, carry out regular literacy education in a planned and organized manner, so that winter literacy schools that are run better can be transformed into people's schools, first starting from eliminating illiteracy among young people and village cadres, and gradually eliminating illiteracy. In areas where regular literacy education is carried out, the Winter Literacy Committee can be transformed into a Literacy Committee in order to unify forces and strengthen leadership. Xin County of Pingyuan Province has planned to transform the winter literacy schools in 445 villages into people's schools, and based on past experience (the county transformed the winter literacy schools in 126 villages into regular people's schools in 1948), it has proposed the points that should be paid attention to when transforming winter literacy schools into people's schools: (1) When winter literacy schools are transformed into people's schools, the learning organization must be reorganized according to the needs of spring plowing. When grouping, it is necessary to divide Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists into each group in a planned way, so that they can play a backbone role, clear the masses' thinking, stabilize learning emotions, and pay special attention to ensuring that the masses can learn something on time. (2) The teachers of the people's schools are the key to running literacy education well. The county proposed that the teachers of the people's schools should have three conditions: enthusiastic about education, have a considerable political level, and have a cultural level above senior primary school. In addition, the people's schools must discuss and implement various teaching systems based on the opinions of the masses.

　　东北华北等地冬学行将结束
    六百万农民参加学习
    部分冬学转常年民校
    【本报讯】综合各方报道：华北、东北、华东各地六百万以上农民参加的冬学运动已进入最后阶段，正着手布置将一部分的冬学转入常年民校，为今后普遍开展识字运动打下基础。
    本届冬学工作开展极为普遍。据不完全的材料统计：东北区的旅大、吉林、辽东二十七县，辽西二十一县三市，松江二十县三市，黑龙江二十四县，热河十八县市旗二十五个区以及沈阳、鞍山、本溪三市郊区，共有冬学四万零一百零七处，炕头小组三万六千四百七十一个，入学者共达三百零八万九千五百六十四人，占全东北农村人口的百分之十一点五强。华北区的河北省一百个县镇，平原全省和北京市郊区，入冬学群众共二百零六万四千九百七十五人；山西省四十四个县在五千二百四十六个行政村中建立了冬学一万零零七十一处，超过了原预定平均每个行政村建立一点五处冬学的计划。华东区的山东省各县入冬学人数达六十二万八千七百九十多人；苏南行署区参加冬学的农民近十万人。
    各地对本届冬学一般都很重视。去年冬季，先后整理或建立了县、区、村各级领导冬学的机构（冬学委员会或文教委员会），训练了大批冬学教师。华北各地训练冬学教师共一万八千余名，山东仅胶东区就训练了一万一千三百九十四人，东北辽西、辽东十一个县训练了三千八百五十四名。各训练班的学习内容包括政治、时事、生产和文化建设，并研究办冬学的具体方法。同时，各地一般都在农民中进行了广泛的宣传动员工作，利用区、村各种会议讲解、讨论冬学工作；用说服方法，消除农民群众“怕上冬学耽误生产”的思想顾虑，使上冬学逐渐成为农民的自觉要求。在冬学开课之后，各地一般注意了对冬学的检查、辅导。如山西省教育厅和各专、县都派出了冬学辅导检查组，巡回指导各地冬学，帮助其解决困难，并纠正偏向，交流各地经验。该省为解决冬学教师讲授政治课的困难，创建了由县级主要干部领导，以区为单位设立的“传授站”，统一布置冬学政治课教育内容和教学方法。河北的邯郸专区各县区，都订立了定期的检查制度，并组织冬学教员定期集中学习与互相观摩，以提高冬学的教学效果。
    根据各地不同情况施教
    提高群众文化政治水平
    本届冬学的教育方针比较明确。大部冬学建立了比较正规的学习制度，通过民主讨论，订立学习公约和上课、请假、点名、测验等制度。在教学内容上，老解放区一般掌握了农民翻身后对学习文化的要求，以文化科学和生产技术教育为主；新区则着重政治教育，但也不放松对青年男女的识字教育。大部冬学并注意与当地的中心工作结合进行，如冬学学习小组和打柴、纺织、编席、运输等小组结合；或在冬学里结合教学发动学员订生产计划、讲解生产救灾、土地改革、减租等与当地中心工作有关的政策。因之，不独提高了群众的文化、政治水平，也结合了群众的切身利益，推动了中心工作。如东北各地冬学文盲学员一般学会了一百五十个字，一部分人学了三百字以上，山西许多县通过冬学进行了妇婴卫生教育，榆社县并在冬学中训练了七十五名助产员，太谷县程家庄结合冬学防治了流行的麻疹。东北海伦县东丰村通过冬学推动了打柴、打鱼等副业，不到二十天全村收入东北币一千八百多万元。苏南昆山县城南乡二保通过冬学发动农民诉苦与进行阶级教育，全保百分之六十八的农民都加入了农会。
    学习与春耕准备工作结合进行
    调整学习组织注意选择好教员
    目前，春耕即将开始，各地已布置总结本届冬学经验，并将一部分冬学转入常年民校，以为将来普遍开展农民识字运动打下基础。东北部分地区，已将农民学习与春耕准备工作结合进行，在冬学里讲解互助组的好处、介绍新农具、发动组织农民送粪等，使生产和学习趋于一致，逐渐把季节性的教育发展为经常性的教育。辽西省并计划以北镇为重点，选择一个区普遍建立各村的文化站，开办识字教育，以吸取经验。河北省教育厅已指示各地，一面认真总结本届冬学工作，奖励模范冬学和模范冬学教师；一面抓紧结束冬学运动时机，在早已结束土地改革、群众生产恢复较好、文化较发达的地区，有计划、有领导地开展常年识字教育，使办理较好的冬学转为民校，首先从消灭青年及村干部中的文盲开始，逐渐扫除文盲。在开展常年识字教育地区，可将冬学委员会转为识字委员会，以便统一力量，加强领导，平原省的莘县已计划将四百四十五个村的冬学转为民校，并根据过去经验（该县在一九四八年曾将一百二十六个村的冬学转为常年民校），提出转冬学为民校应注意之点：（一）由冬学转民校，学习组织必须根据春耕需要重新调整。编组时要有计划地将共产党员、青年团员、积极分子分编到各小组里去，由他们起骨干作用，打通群众思想、稳定学习情绪，并特别注意要使群众能按时学到东西。（二）民校教师是办好识字教育的关键。该县提出民校教师要具备三个条件：热心教育，有相当的政治水平，有高小以上文化程度。此外，民校必须根据群众意见，议定和实行各种教学制度。
