More than 50 people, including telecommunications engineers, engineering personnel, materials personnel, and design personnel from various regions, attended the conference. The conference first heard reports from various regions and a report by Wang Zheng, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, on the guidelines for this year's national long-distance telecommunications engineering construction plan, and specifically discussed and resolved many issues.

The conference focused on formulating specific plans for this year's long-distance telecommunications engineering construction, including construction plans to connect telecommunications communications in various regions of the country and international telecommunications wired lines. The conference believes that in order to save materials and reduce costs, a unified allocation of national telecommunications construction funds and materials should be implemented; and pre-budget and final account systems should be strictly enforced. The conference made specific provisions on transmission standards, call centers, and other issues to improve communication efficiency; and adopted a system for construction inspection and acceptance. The conference stipulated that engineering corps should be established in various regions to be responsible for construction projects, and engineering personnel should be uniformly dispatched; and strengthen the security equipment of all machines and lines and the safety facilities for staff. The conference also stipulated new machine and line maintenance methods and a responsible system for contracted machines and contracted lines.

At the closing ceremony of the conference, Zhu Xuefan, Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, delivered a closing speech, stating: In future engineering construction, everyone must be careful in calculation and strict in economy, oppose waste; we must use very little funds and materials to maximize effectiveness; at the same time, we must race against time and complete the task ahead of schedule.
