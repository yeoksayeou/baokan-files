    Preparing for a Conference to Deploy Work
    Implementing the Cash Deposit System
    Implementing the Decision on Unified Financial and Economic Work
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th] The Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and its subordinate financial and economic departments unanimously support the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work." The Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and the Central-South Bureau of the CCP Central Committee are currently preparing to convene a conference of the main responsible persons of the provincial and municipal people's governments and the cadres of financial and economic departments to study the specific steps to implement the State Council's decision in the Central-South Region. He Youqi, one of the heads of the Central China Branch of the People's Bank of China, believes: "The waste of cash caused by the lack of uniformity in financial work in the Central-South Region, and the inconsistency of financial management in various places, which gives financial speculators an opportunity to exploit, are important factors in price fluctuations. The State Council's decision is timely. If unified management is not implemented, it will increase the financial and economic difficulties of the country, which is detrimental to the people of the whole country." Zeng Chuanliu, one of the heads of the Ministry of Trade, said: We must strictly review the organization of our department, determine the work quota for each staff member, and check the wasteful phenomenon of having too many people and too little work. We must study from top to bottom how to improve the turnover rate of funds, accelerate the exchange of materials, reduce and even eliminate idle funds; complete the business management policies and plans stipulated by the Central Ministry of Trade, withdraw currency, strengthen the material storage and transportation of companies and stores at all levels, reduce losses, severely punish corruption, return every bit to the public, and oppose extravagance and waste. Lin Jinzhang, head of the Central-South Region Taxation Bureau, expressed 100% support for each point listed in the State Council's decision. He said: Strengthening taxation work is an important link in overcoming the country's financial and economic difficulties. In the Central-South Region, it is necessary to more deeply examine the remaining tax-lightening thoughts of some cadres.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th] According to the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work," the Trade Department of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee began to implement the cash deposit system on March 6. After receiving the Interim Measures for the Management of Trade Cash of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade, and the joint order issued by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade and the People's Bank of China on the Trade Treasury Contract and Accounting Procedures on March 5, the department convened a meeting of managers of state-owned trade companies in the Central-South Region at 10:00 am on the 6th. Zhou Kangmin, manager of the China National Grain Corporation of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade, focused on explaining the basic spirit and specific requirements of the trade contract measures. Some managers raised difficulties in implementation at the meeting. Zeng Chuanliu, one of the heads of the Ministry of Trade, emphasized in his speech that the central decision should be implemented first, and then the difficulties that may arise should be resolved. After discussing the methods to solve the difficulties, the managers of the companies unanimously expressed their determination to implement the orders of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade and the People's Bank of China, and began to implement them on the evening of the 6th. The Trade Department of the Central-South Region Military and Administrative Committee has also urgently telegraphed the industry and commerce departments/bureaus of various provinces and cities under its jurisdiction and various trade branch companies to implement the cash deposit system in accordance with the prescribed date.

    筹备开会布置工作
    开始实行现金纳库办法
    贯彻执行统一财经工作决定
    【新华社汉口十一日电】中南军政委员会暨所属各财经部门一致拥护中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”。中南军政委员会及中共中央中南局现正着手筹备召开各省、市人民政府及共产党的主要负责人暨财经部门干部会议，研究如何在中南区贯彻执行政务院决定的具体步骤。中国人民银行华中区行负责人之一何幼琦认为：“目前中南区金融工作上因不统一所产生的现金使用浪费和各地金融管理不一致，使金融投机商有可乘之机，都是物价波动的重要因素。政务院的决定正合时宜，如再不统一管理，将会使国家财政经济增加更多困难，这对全国人民是不利的。”贸易部负责人之一曾传六说：我们要在本部门严格审查机关编制，确定每个工作人员的工作定额，检查人多事少的浪费现象；要从上而下地研究提高资金周转率，加速物资交流，减少以至消灭资金闲放；完成中央贸易部所规定的业务经营方针、计划，回笼货币，加强各级公司、商店的物资保管、运输，减少损失，严惩贪污，点滴归公，反对铺张浪费。中南区税务管理局负责人林锦章表示百分之百地拥护该政务院决定所列各点。他说：加强税收工作一项，是克服国家财经困难的重要一环，在中南区尚须更深入地检查某些干部残存的轻税思想。
    【新华社汉口十一日电】中南军政委员会贸易部根据中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，已于三月六日开始执行现金纳库办法。该部于三月五日接奉中央人民政府贸易部贸易现金暂行管理办法、中央人民政府贸易部和中国人民银行颁布贸易金库合同及会计处理手续联合命令后，即于六日上午十时召集中南区各国营贸易公司经理会议，由中央人民政府贸易部中国粮食总公司经理周康民着重说明贸易合同措施的基本精神与具体要求。会上有个别经理提出执行困难。贸易部负责人之一曾传六在讲话时强调应首先执行中央决定，再行解决可能发生的困难。各公司经理经讨论了解决困难的办法后，一致表示坚决执行中央人民政府贸易部及人民银行的命令，并于六日晚开始执行。中南区军政委员会贸易部并已急电所属各省市工商厅、局及各贸易分支公司，按照规定日期执行现金纳库办法。
