Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: Shanghai's five million citizens, under the leadership of the People's Government, have launched a firm and tenacious anti-bombing struggle, achieving significant results in the past month. Since the Kuomintang remnants, under the direction of American imperialism, frantically and indiscriminately bombed the urban area on February 6th, the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government immediately took emergency measures, calling on all citizens to mobilize urgently and launch an anti-bombing struggle; at the same time, various emergency air defense decrees and instructions were promulgated. The city's Air Defense and Security Committee was established on February 11th to uniformly lead the city's air defense work. Air defense committees and air defense groups have been universally organized in various organs, factories, schools, and neighborhoods in the urban area, actively carrying out anti-bombing work. All public and private factories in the city have taken necessary protective measures for their main machines, piling up sandbags or taking appropriate cover. Ships densely packed on both sides of the Huangpu River have also been dispersed and moored. In terms of medical rescue, all public and private hospitals and doctors in the city have organized more than three hundred rescue teams and one hundred and ten surgical groups; the Medical Workers' Union has also held first-aid training courses, teaching citizens general first-aid knowledge such as hemostasis, disinfection, and bandaging. All organs, factories, and schools have enthusiastically sent people to participate in the learning. Now every larger neighborhood in the city has an organization of rescue teams. Fire protection organizations in various units and fire protection groups in neighborhoods are actively preparing to store sand and water; the Luwan District and Huangpu District have held large-scale fire drills.

The various units under the Municipal People's Government have established various organizations to serve the citizens in order to carry out the anti-bombing work well. The Public Utilities Bureau organized technicians to form a "Water and Electricity Repair Team"; the Real Estate Management Office established an "Engineering Rescue Team" responsible for rescuing and repairing bombed public houses. In addition, in order to provide temporary emergency relief to bombing victims, the Municipal Government also organized a "Relief Work Team," with twenty work stations and six mutual aid zones set up throughout the city, and about 50,000 victims have received temporary relief.

In the anti-bombing struggle, the working class demonstrated a high degree of heroism and the spirit of being masters of the country.

The working class demonstrated a high degree of heroism and the spirit of being masters of the country in the anti-bombing struggle. After the Shanghai Power Company was bombed by enemy planes, the workers did not rush to rescue their bombed homes, but organized more than one hundred rescue commando teams overnight to repair the damaged parts, so that the power supply in some parts of the city was quickly restored. Workers from the Zhongfang Printing and Dyeing Factory and privately-owned Dafeng, Zhenhua, and other factories, in order to rescue the cloth piled in the dyeing vats that was about to rot due to the power outage, disregarded the dangers of toxic gases irritating their lungs and caustic soda corroding their skin, washing and baking the cloth with manpower, and rescued more than 110,000 pieces of cloth in four days. The workers of the Zhongfang No. 11 Factory automatically formulated a factory protection agreement. During the Lunar New Year's Eve and holidays, the factory workers not only insisted on patrolling and standing guard, but also used sandbags to protect the sheds and workshops on the 29th and 30th days of the twelfth lunar month. The workers of various factories have tried every means to solve the difficulties caused by power outages and have strived to complete their production tasks in extremely difficult circumstances. For example, the workers of the privately-owned Rongfeng Yarn Factory erected trucks, started the motors, and rotated the wheels to drive the baking cylinders, quickly completing the baking procedures for 2,700 pieces of cloth. The workers of the East China Military Region Clothing Factory moved the machines to the windows and used sunlight instead of electric light to maintain production. The factory's employees put forward the slogan "Resolutely complete the production of summer uniforms and support the army in liberating Taiwan." When the electric shears could not be used, the tailoring department used hand-cutting. After the power supply was partially restored, the workers automatically worked overtime for five hours a day, cutting 30,000 sets of clothing in two days. Many workers in private factories also persuaded some capitalists who wanted to close down. They automatically lent their annual bonuses and wages to the capitalists to add generators, and automatically extended their working hours to repair the machines. In order to solve the difficulty of power outages, many factories have set up their own power generation equipment. According to preliminary estimates, since the "February 6th" bombing, the generators prepared by the factories themselves have reached less than a thousand; factories and workshops that did not have their own power generation equipment for a while also used manual labor to produce and overcome the power outage period.

Citizens from all walks of life in Shanghai enthusiastically support the government's various anti-bombing measures and calls, and consciously abide by the government's various air defense and security regulations. In order to overcome the difficulties in water and electricity supply caused by the bombing, citizens actively engaged in digging wells and storing water. Citizens of Yangshupu dug out more than two hundred abandoned wells that had been closed for many years in three days; citizens of Hejian Road dug a large pool that could supply water to five hundred households. Various organs, factories, and schools have formulated specific measures to save water and electricity. Each household also consciously reduces the wattage of light bulbs, reduces electricity consumption, and tries to handle affairs during the day. The neon lights of shops and advertising lights that consume a lot of electricity have been stopped; unnecessary street lights have also been reduced or cancelled as much as possible.

In preventing sabotage by special agents, trade unions in various industries have organized pickets, and major neighborhoods also have organizations to prevent special agents, assisting the security authorities in suppressing the activities of saboteurs.

The enemy planes' inhuman and crazy bombing further aroused the patriotic enthusiasm of Shanghai citizens to assist the government in solving the current financial and economic difficulties. In the month since the "February 6th" bombing, the sales of Shanghai public bonds have increased by more than 10 million shares.

Shanghai citizens realize that the difficulties brought about by the enemy planes' bombing are temporary, and five million citizens use a calm, composed, and unyielding anti-bombing struggle to respond to the dying struggle of the bandits.

　　上海五百万市民坚定顽强进行反轰炸的斗争
    团结一致粉碎残匪垂死挣扎
    【新华社上海九日电】上海市五百万市民，在人民政府领导下展开了坚定而顽强的反轰炸斗争，一个月来，已获得显著的成效。自二月六日国民党残匪在美帝国主义指示下疯狂滥炸市区后，上海市军管会和市政府立即采取紧急措施，号召全市市民紧急动员起来，展开反轰炸斗争；同时颁布了各种防空紧急法令和指示。全市防空治安委员会于二月十一日成立，统一领导全市的防空工作。市区各机关、工厂、学校、里弄普遍组织了防空委员会和防空小组，积极展开反轰炸的工作。全市各公、私工厂都已将主要机件作必要的防护，堆集沙包或作适当的隐蔽。密集于黄浦江两岸的船只也已分散停泊。在医药救护方面，全市各公私医院和医师，组织了三百个以上的救护队和一百一十个手术组；医务工会还举办了急救训练班，教授市民关于止血、消毒、包扎等一般急救常识，各机关、工厂、学校都踊跃派人参加学习。现市内每一个较大的里弄都已经有了救护队的组织。各单位的消防组织和里弄的消防小组，都积极作贮沙贮水的准备；卢家湾区和黄浦区曾举行大规模的消防演习。
    市人民政府所属各单位，为了很好地展开反轰炸工作，特别成立了各种为市民服务的组织。公用局将技术人员组织起来成立“水电抢修队”；房地产管理处成立了“工程救护队”，负责抢救和修理被炸的公共房屋。此外，为了临时紧急救济被炸灾民，市政府并组织了“救济工作队”，全市分设二十个工作站和六个互助区，已有五万左右的灾民得到临时救济。
    在反轰炸斗争中，工人阶级表现了高度的英勇精神和主人翁气概。
    工人阶级在反轰炸斗争中，表现了高度的英勇精神和爱护国家财产的主人翁气概。上海电力公司遭匪机轰炸后，工人们不去抢救自己被炸的家，连夜组织了一百多个抢救突击队，抢修被损的机件，使市内部分地区供电迅速恢复。中纺印染厂和私营达丰、振华等厂工人，为了抢救堆在染缸中因停电而即将遭到霉烂的布匹，不顾毒气刺戟肺部和烧碱腐蚀皮肤等危险，用人力冲洗、烘制，四天中救出了十一万多匹布。中纺十一厂的工人们自动订定护厂公约，在旧历除夕和年节时，该厂工友不但坚持巡夜站岗，而且在旧历腊月二十九、三十两天，将方棚间、车间都用沙包保护好。各工厂工人们曾想尽办法解决因停电而发生的困难，在极艰难的情况下，仍努力完成生产任务。如私营荣丰纱厂的工人，将卡车竖起来，发动马达，使车轮转动，这样来带动烘筒，迅速地完成二千七百匹布的烘制手续。华东军区被服厂的工人们，将机器搬到窗口，以日光代电光来维持生产。该厂职工提出“坚决完成夏服生产，支援大军解放台湾”的口号。裁剪部在电剪不能使用时，就用手工来裁剪。电力部分恢复后，工人们每日自动加工五小时，两天内剪裁了三万套服装。很多私营工厂的工人们并说服了少数资方想停业的打算，他们自动借出年奖、工资给资方添置发电机，并且自动延长工作时间来修整机器。为了解决停电的困难，许多工厂纷纷自行装置发电设备，据初步估计，自“二六”轰炸后，各厂自备的发电机已达千部以下；一时没有自备发电设备的工厂、作坊，也都用人工来生产，渡过停电的时期。
    上海各阶层的市民，热烈地拥护政府的各种反轰炸措施和号召，自觉地遵守政府的各项防空和治安规定。为了克服轰炸带来的水、电供应的困难，市民们积极从事挖井、贮水的工作。杨树浦市民在三天内挖出已经闭塞多年的废井二百多个；河间路市民挖了一个可供五百家用水的大水塘。各机关、工厂、学校都订出节省水电的具体办法。各住户也自觉地减小灯泡的度数，减少电量，尽量在白天办事。商店的霓虹灯和耗电甚大的广告灯都已停用；不必要的路灯也尽量减少或取消。
    在防止特务破坏方面，各业工会都组织了纠察队，各大里弄也有防范特务的组织，协助治安当局镇压破坏分子的活动。
    匪机丧失人性的疯狂轰炸，更加激发了上海市民协助政府解决当前财经困难的爱国热情，从“二六”轰炸后的一个月中，上海市公债的销数增加了一千多万分。
    上海市民认识到匪机轰炸带来的困难是暂时的，五百万市民用镇定、沉着、不屈的反轰炸斗争，来答复匪帮的垂死前的挣扎。
