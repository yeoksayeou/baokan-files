　　Ministry of Finance and Trade Approved Decision
    Taxed Export Goods Will No Longer Receive Tax Refunds
    Export Difficulties to be Handled by Foreign Trade Departments
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government recently submitted a request to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and it was decided that export goods that have already paid commodity tax will not be refunded commodity tax; If manufacturers who have paid tax on their goods and transport them for export encounter difficulties or losses in promoting sales in foreign markets and request assistance from the government, the foreign trade management department will handle the matter. The above decision has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government to the General Taxation Bureau to inform local tax bureaus throughout the country to implement it. In accordance with the Central People's Government's policy of encouraging export manufacturers to compete for foreign markets, the practice of refunding commodity tax on export goods that have already paid commodity tax in cases where sales are difficult or losses are incurred abroad has been piloted in the past. Since the tax authorities do not directly manage export trade affairs, they do not have timely knowledge of foreign market conditions, and it is difficult to grasp the situation when handling tax refunds. In addition, the tax refund procedures are inconvenient, and the intention of encouraging exports has not been fully realized. Therefore, two situations have arisen during tax refunds: one is that it is easy for individual unscrupulous exporters to exploit loopholes and demand tax refunds for goods that still have substantial profits from exports, thus losing the original intention of tax refunds to encourage exports; the other is that tax bureaus often cannot refund tax payments in a timely manner due to national treasury matters and the time it takes to report, and export manufacturers will still suffer losses if prices rise. Based on the above situation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade have submitted a request and it has been decided that export goods that have already paid commodity tax will not be refunded commodity tax. The foreign trade department will handle assistance and incentives for exports, so that legitimate export manufacturers can obtain the benefits of government incentives.

　　财政贸易两部呈准决定
    已税出口货物不再退税
    出口商如有困难由对外贸易部门办理
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府财政部及贸易部顷呈准中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会，决定对已缴纳货物税的出口货物，一律不退还货物税；厂商已税货品运销出口，如在国外市场推销有困难或亏本而向政府请求照顾者，由对外贸易管理部门受理。以上决定业经中央人民政府财政部饬税务总局令知全国各地税局照办。按中央人民政府为了奖励出口厂商争取国外市场，对已纳货物税的出口货物在国外推销困难或亏本者，过去曾试行退还货物税的办法，执行以来，由于税务机关不直接管理出口贸易事务，对国外市场情况了解不及时，在办理退税时，难于掌握，再加退税手续不便利，未能充分实现奖励出口的意旨，因此在退税时发生两种情况：一种是容易被个别不法的出口商钻空子，要求对出口仍有厚利的货物也退税，因而失去退税奖励出口的本意；另一种税局因国库关系，转报需时，往往不能及时退还税款，如遇物价上涨，出口厂商还要受到亏损。根据以上情况，财政部和贸易部呈准决定对已缴纳货物税的出口货物，不退还货物税，由对外贸易部门办理照顾与奖励出口事宜，以使正当的出口厂商获得政府奖励的实惠。
