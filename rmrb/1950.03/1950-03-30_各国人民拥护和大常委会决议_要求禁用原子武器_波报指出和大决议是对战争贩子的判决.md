　　[Xinhua News Agency, March 29th] (Combined reports from TASS and Polish Press Agency): The resolution of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has been supported by the people of many countries.

　　Many cities and industrial centers in Sweden, such as Örebro, Gothenburg, and Norrköping, have held mass rallies demanding peace. The members of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee who attended the Stockholm meeting, including Fadeyev and Ehrenburg (USSR), Xiao San (China), and Kent (USA), spoke at these rallies respectively, and were warmly welcomed by the audience. Unanimous resolutions were passed in various places, fully supporting the resolution of the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, demanding the unconditional banning of atomic weapons.

　　The Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita and the People's Tribune both published commentaries. Rzeczpospolita emphasized: The Stockholm meeting's declaration that the atomic bomb is illegal is an authoritative international declaration and a verdict on warmongers. The People's Tribune declared: Polish workers, peasants, intellectuals, and youth are carrying out socialist labor competitions to strengthen Poland, strengthen the unity of all nations in the world, and prevent the criminal attempts of war instigators.

　　The Mongolian newspaper Ünen wrote in an editorial: The Mongolian people unanimously support the resolution of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee. With the fraternal help of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people are confidently advancing along the road of socialism. They are unswervingly fighting for peace, security, democracy, and socialism.

　　The Chairman of the Dutch Peace Committee, Booker, published an article in the Dutch Communist Party's organ, De Waarheid, emphatically pointing out that the Dutch people support the resolution of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, namely that the government that first uses atomic weapons will be denounced by all mankind as a war criminal.
