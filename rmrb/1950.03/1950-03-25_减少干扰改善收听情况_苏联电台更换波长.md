　　Reduced Interference Improves Reception
    Soviet Radio Stations Change Wavelengths
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th TASS] The delegations of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic participated in the International Radio Conference held in Copenhagen in 1948. The conference adopted a plan to reallocate the wavelengths of medium and long-wave radio broadcasting stations in the European region.

    The agreement adopted by the conference stipulated that radio stations should change to new wavelengths starting from March 15, 1950. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has approved this agreement. The implementation of the new plan for reallocating radio wavelengths will reduce interference between radio stations and improve reception. Soviet radio broadcasting stations will broadcast according to this plan starting in March.
