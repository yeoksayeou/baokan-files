　　Soviet Vocational Education
    By E.H. Mitinsky Translated by Zhang Zhangli
    (I) Primary Vocational Education
    In 1920, factory apprentice schools were established to train skilled workers, their task being to train "workers capable of raising production to a high level and active participants in socialist construction."

    In 1921, there were 43 factory apprentice schools with a total of 2,000 students, mainly in metal cooling processing and the textile industry. The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union played a significant role in the establishment and development of factory apprentice schools. From 1922 onwards, factory apprentice schools began to develop rapidly:
        In 1923, there were 50,000 students
        In 1926, there were 95,000 students
    From 1930 onwards, due to the rapid growth of socialist industry, the number of factory apprentice schools and the number of students in them increased particularly dramatically.

    According to the materials of the Central National Economic Statistics Bureau, the number of factory apprentice schools and the number of students in them were as follows:
     Year		Number of Schools	Number of Students
     1938    	1,513	224,262
     1939    	1,535	242,236
    In the early years of the establishment of factory apprentice schools, those receiving education were young people who had grown up before the revolution, the vast majority of whom were semi-literate. Therefore, the duration of study was three to four years, and general education subjects occupied a significant position in the curriculum. In the first few years, theoretical teaching was allocated four hours per day, and production teaching—four hours. In later years, theoretical subjects—two hours, production teaching—six hours.

    In later years, due to the growth of culture in the Soviet Union, the general educational level of entrants to factory apprentice schools greatly improved; the general educational foundation of entrants had been raised to the completion of seven-year education. In this way, it was possible to concentrate production teaching in factory apprentice schools particularly within a highly compressed period of one and a half to two years (depending on the specialty).

    In accordance with the resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union on September 15, 1933, the study of factory apprentice schools was transformed, after which nearly 80 percent of the time was allocated to production teaching, and 20 percent was allocated to theoretical subjects related to the specialty. The age of admission was stipulated to be no lower than 15-18 years old (depending on the specialty). The duration of study varied according to the specialty. According to the materials of the Central National Economic Statistics Bureau on January 1, 1939, they were in fact 6-9 months (less common) to 24 months; the most common was to carry out studies within a period of 12-18 months.

    The rapid growth of socialist industry and the elimination of unemployment in the Soviet Union raised the issue of the state's organized training of new workers from urban and rural youth, and the establishment of labor reserves.

    On October 2, 1940, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, based on Stalin's initiative, promulgated the order "On the State Labor Reserves of the Soviet Union," which stated:
    "The task of further developing our industry requires a constant influx of workers into mines, mines, transportation, workshops and factories. The smooth development of our industry is impossible without the continuous replenishment of members of the working class.

    In our country, unemployment has been completely eliminated, and poverty and bankruptcy in cities and villages have ended forever. Therefore, we do not have those who are forced to knock on the doors of factories and manufacturing plants to ask for work, thereby spontaneously forming a constant labor reserve for industry.

    Under these conditions, the state faces the task of organizing the training of new workers from urban and rural youth and establishing the labor reserves necessary for industry."

    This order stipulated the establishment of: (1) two-year vocational schools to train metalworkers, smelting workers, chemical industry workers, miners, petroleum workers, and skilled workers of various other professions; (2) railway schools with a two-year period of study to train skilled railway transport workers; (3) factory apprentice schools with a six-month period of study to train workers in mass professions.

    All students in these schools are publicly funded (free study, with the state providing meals, clothing, shoes, shirts, textbooks, and reference books, and students from other cities and rural areas are also provided with dormitories). For students in vocational schools and railway schools, uniforms are stipulated.

    The order of October 2, 1940, stipulated that 800,000 to 1,000,000 workers and rural youth should be called up (mobilized) annually to study in vocational schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools. Students graduating from these schools must work in state-owned enterprises for four years, with wages according to general regulations.

    According to the decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union on October 2, 1940, in order to lead the training and allocation of state labor reserves, a General Administration of Labor Reserves was established under the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, which was changed to the Soviet Labor Reserves Headquarters in 1946. Labor Reserves Administrations were established in the various republics, regions, provinces, and cities.

    The main characteristic of the new organization for training skilled workers is its planning and significant clarity on a national scale. Previously, when this training was entrusted to factory apprentice schools, these schools were run by individual enterprises, so: (1) some enterprises showed sufficient attention to the training of labor, while others were very poor, or did nothing; (2) there were great differences in the content and methods of teaching work in the training of labor; (3) the source of students in factory apprentice schools was almost entirely young workers; now it widely includes the youth of collective farms.

    After organizing the labor reserve training system, a prestigious and powerful organizational and teaching method leadership center appeared—the General Administration of Labor Reserves (now called the Ministry). Huge step-by-step forces have been absorbed, and methods for training and improving the proficiency of teachers have also been developed. Unified all-Soviet courses and teaching plans for most specialties have been formulated. A strong material foundation for the training of the labor reserve school system has been guaranteed. Great attention is paid to educational work. And the magazine "Production Education" is published.

    Vocational schools and railway schools recruit boys and girls aged 14-15 with an educational level no lower than primary school (or the fourth grade of a ten-year middle school). In these schools, depending on the specialty, the duration of study continues for two to three years.

    Obviously, the curriculum varies according to different specialties. In order to understand the content of the study, here are some figures: the number of teaching hours for a two-year course in a vocational school (specialty in repairing and assembling inspection regulators):

    I. Total teaching hours for the production technology section
    1. Production learning................2,225
    2. Specialized technology..................286
    3. Electrical engineering and electrical materials science........138
    II. Total teaching hours for the general technology and general education section
    1. Drafting..........................86
    2. Mathematics........................207
    3. Physics..........................112
    4. Russian........................190
    5. Political Science.....................164
    III. Military-Physical training 164 Total 3,572

    Thus, the part of general education and sports accounts for about 25 percent, while the education of production technology accounts for nearly 75 percent. A school year is divided into four segments. In mid-July, production teaching operations are carried out for only 18 hours per week, and in mid-August, there is a complete vacation. The study day is seven hours, of which two hours are for subjects in general education and specialized disciplines, and five hours are for production learning in the factory.

    Production learning is carried out in internship factories and factory departments, and great attention is paid to the good equipment of these factories.

    Graduates of vocational and railway schools are issued certificates of specialized technical skilled work. Young workers who have graduated from these schools have the qualifications to be fourth-grade to fifth-grade fitters, turners, and others, and are sent to production by the Labor Reserve Department, where they work using the Stakhanovite movement method and can receive a monthly salary of 1,000 rubles or higher.

    Factory apprentice schools recruit students aged 16-17. The duration of study is six months to one year, depending on the specialty. The teaching plan of factory apprentice schools includes production learning and a minimum of 100 hours of technical theory.

    Vocational schools or railway schools and factory apprentice schools are led by the principal; production learning work is led by the director of the school's production teaching department; educational work is led by the vice-principal of the political section. Under the principal, there is an evaluation body—the school production teaching conference.

    In vocational schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools, great educational work is carried out to improve students' political and ideological level, consolidate conscious discipline, develop students' will and character, initiative and creativity of Bolshevik characteristics, cultivate conduct and attitude to life, and carry out art education, military-physical training, etc.

    In this educational work, the Communist Youth League organization plays an important role.

    On July 22, 1944, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a series of instructions to strengthen the educational work of the Communist Youth League organization in vocational schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools. These organizations should fully consolidate the prestige of the leaders, technicians, teachers, and educators of schools and factory apprentice schools, help their work, and show great creativity and initiative in improving political work, mass cultural and educational work, and military sports work; organize literary evenings, good book exhibitions to promote students' interest in reading; help libraries promote books, etc.

    Lectures and reports on political issues and scientific topics are held in vocational schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools, and groups (choirs, music, drama, etc.) and sports teams with skating, fencing, boxing, and other parts are organized. And the All-Soviet Sports Association "Labor Reserve" was established. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League, amateur art performances of labor reserve schools were held in Moscow in the autumn of 1943, and teams from all over the Soviet Union participated in this performance. This performance was carried out at a very high level, and artistic performances were made for songs, musical works, dances, and skills.

    Schools in the labor reserve system carried out great work during the Great Patriotic War. The number of schools increased from 1,550 to 2,570 during the war years. Although the first five years of the existence of the labor reserve training system, except for the first few months, were spent under the heavy conditions of the war, the Soviet government still spared no financial assistance to this training. The total amount spent for this purpose in the five years from October 1940 to October 1945 reached 11 billion rubles, of which food expenses were 4.6 billion, and expenses for social and health measures were 240 million. A total of 200 million meters of woolen and cotton fabrics were spent on students' clothing, etc. 15 sanatoriums and recuperation places were opened for students and staff of the labor reserve system, etc.

    In the first five years of the labor reserve system schools, a total of 2.25 million skilled workers and workers of various professions were trained, of which 2 million were educated during the Great Patriotic War.

    Students of vocational schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools, these young men and women, on the one hand, study, and on the other hand, manufacture many products of defense significance. Many students in the labor reserve system schools participated in the battle against the German aggressors, and 23 students from these schools won the lofty title of Hero of the Soviet Union for their heroism and courage on the front lines of the Great Patriotic War.

    In recent years, the Soviet Union has done a lot in training labor reserves, and there is more to be done. The decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on September 30, 1946, pointed out a series of important measures to improve this training and instructed the Labor Reserve Department to create the following number of skilled workers in vocational schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools:

    1946................450,000 people
    1947................760,000 people
    1948................980,000 people
    1949................1,090,000 people
    1950................1,250,000 people
    And a total of 4.5 million skilled workers will be created during the fourth Stalin Five-Year Plan period.

    In addition to the schools of the Labor Reserve Department as the main canal for creating skilled workers, primary vocational education is also carried out in workers' schools attached to most enterprises, junior technical knowledge study groups, and various short-term training classes.

  (II) Secondary Vocational Education

    Middle-level qualified specialists in various departments of industry, construction, transportation, communication, and agriculture are created in technical secondary schools. Middle-level medical personnel (assistant doctors, midwives) are cultivated in medical schools; primary school teachers are cultivated in normal schools, etc.

    Before the October Revolution, secondary vocational education was very weak.

    In 1914, there were only 35,800 students in 295 secondary vocational schools. The leap-forward development of socialist industry, agriculture, and culture created conditions for the vigorous growth of higher and secondary vocational education in the Soviet Union.

    The rapid increase in the number of Soviet technical secondary schools and other secondary vocational schools began in the 1930-31 academic year. In the 1929-30 academic year, there were a total of 1,115 secondary vocational schools in the Soviet Union, and in the next academic year, namely the 1930-31 academic year, there were 2,955, and in the 1938-39 academic year, there were 3,732.

    Moreover, the average number of students (capacity) in these schools, whether previous or newly opened, has suddenly increased. Before the revolution, each secondary vocational school had an average capacity of 121 students. In the 1920s, it rose to 170-190 (reaching 196 in the 1929-30 academic year), and in the 1938-39 academic year, it rose to 255.

    The increase in the number of schools and their capacity has greatly increased the number of students.

    In the 1938-39 academic year, a total of 951,900 students studied in technical secondary schools, medical schools, normal schools, and other secondary vocational schools, which means that the number of secondary vocational school students has increased by 26.6 times compared with before the revolution.

    Women account for a large percentage of secondary vocational school students. In 1928, they accounted for 9.5 percent in industrial, construction, and transportation technical secondary schools, while in 1938, they accounted for 25.9 percent; in agricultural technical secondary schools, the percentage of female students increased from 15.4 to 28.7 during the same period.

    According to the specialties, the distribution of secondary vocational school students in the 1938-39 academic year was as follows:

    Health................263,397 27.7 percent
    Education (primary school teachers, kindergarten workers, library workers)
    ......................255,962 26.8 percent
    Industry and construction............173,202 18.3 percent
    Agriculture................136,922 14.4 percent
    Transportation and communication............62,653 6.6 percent
    Social and economic categories............30,032 3.1 percent
    Art...................29,717 or 3.1 percent

    Just like higher education institutions, technical secondary schools and other secondary vocational schools are also distributed relatively equally in various affiliated republics. Secondary-qualified specialized cadres are cultivated from the youth of various nationalities. For example, in 1939, the Georgian Republic had 214 secondary vocational schools, the Uzbek Republic had 106 secondary vocational schools, the Kazakh Republic had 116 secondary vocational schools, and the Tajik Republic had 29 secondary vocational schools.

    The main forms of secondary vocational schools are: technical secondary schools with a study period of three or four years (industry, transportation, agriculture, etc.), schools with a study period of three or four years (normal, music, etc.), schools with a study period of three years (medicine, law, etc.).

    Secondary vocational schools recruit young men and women aged 14 to 30 with a secondary school seventh-grade education level. Aspiring entrants must pass an entrance test.

    The curriculum of secondary vocational schools includes: (1) general education subjects (literature, mathematics, natural science, physics, chemistry, etc.), the study of which expands the general education that students have obtained in seven-year schools; (2) specialized subjects corresponding to the specialty of the secondary vocational school; (3) production internships, which occupy an important position in the curriculum.

    Many technical secondary schools have well-equipped laboratories, research rooms, and factories. In these schools, future technicians, on the one hand, gain theoretical cultivation through lectures, classes, research room, and laboratory work; on the other hand, they gain practical cultivation through laboratory, teaching factory and farm operations (teaching internships) and operations in enterprises and state farms (production internships).

    Great attention is paid to educational work, which is to improve ideological and political level, develop a dialectical materialist worldview, develop love for the motherland, cultivate will, initiative, sense of responsibility, love for one's profession, and sports. In this educational work, the Communist Youth League organization plays a significant role.

    Extracurricular and off-campus work, such as mass (evenings, lecture meetings, tour groups, etc.) and group work, is widely carried out.

    Students with excellent grades have stipends. Students from other cities and rural areas have public dormitories.

    Students who have completed their studies must participate in national examinations or complete a graduation design in the National Qualification Committee.

    Graduates are assigned work as secondary-qualified specialized personnel according to their specialties.

    In capitalist countries, secondary vocational schools are a dead end, and graduates of these schools are not allowed to receive further higher education. But in the Soviet Union, it is not like this. Experts with secondary qualifications who graduate from technical secondary schools, normal schools, medical and other schools have the opportunity to continue their studies in higher education institutions (according to the selected specialty). They can participate in the entrance test of higher education institutions after continuing to work in practice in their own specialty for more than three years. A certain percentage (usually 5 percent) of outstanding graduates of secondary vocational schools have the right to enter university immediately after graduation without going through a practical service period. The permission of this right shows the concern of the Soviet government for talented youth.

    Many technical secondary schools have organized correspondence education and night school departments. The general organizational and methodological leadership of secondary vocational schools is implemented by the Ministry of Higher Education, while the economic and financial management and direct leadership of teaching work belong to the department or other government agencies to which the specialized vocational school belongs.

　　苏联的职业教育
    Ｅ·Ｈ·米丁斯基作  张章立译
    （一）初级职业教育
    一九二○年为了训练熟练工人曾创设工厂艺徒学校，它们的任务就是训练“能够把生产提高到高度阶段的工人，社会主义建设的积极的参加者。”
    一九二一年已有四十三所共有两千名学生的工厂艺徒学校，主要是在金属冷却加工及纺织工业方面。苏联全国列宁共产主义青年团在工厂艺徒学校的建立和发展中，曾尽了重大的作用。自一九二二年起，工厂艺徒学校开始迅速地发展起来：
        一九二三年曾有学生五○、○○○人
        一九二六年曾有学生九五、○○○人
    从一九三○年起，由于社会主义工业的迅速成长，工厂艺徒学校的数目以及其中的学生人数特别剧烈地增长起来。
    按照中央国民经济统计处的材料，工厂艺徒学校的数目及其中学生的人数如下：
     年份		  学校数目    	学生人数
     一九三八年    一、五一三所	二二四、二六二人
     一九三九年    一、五三五所	二四二、二三六人
    工厂艺徒学校成立的最初几年，在其中受教育的是革命以前长大的青年，绝大多数是半文盲。因此修业期限为三年至四年，而一般教育的课目在课程中占有重大的地位。最初几年在理论教学上分配为每日四小时，生产教学——四小时。在以后几年中，理论课目——两小时，生产教学——六小时。
    在以后的年代中，由于苏联国内的文化的增长，工厂艺徒学校入学者的一般教育水平大大地提高了；入学者的一般教育基础已经提高到修完七年制的教育。这样一来，就可能在工厂艺徒学校中特别使生产教学集中于极为紧缩的一年半至两年（视其专业而定）之内。
    遵照一九三三年九月十五日苏联中央执行委员会及苏联人民委员会的决议，改造工厂艺徒学校的学习，之后将近百分之八十的时间分配于生产教学上，百分之二十分配于和专业相连系的理论课目上。入学的年龄规定不能低于十五——十八岁（依其专业而定）。修业期限按照专业而各有不同，据一九三九年一月一日中央国民经济统计处的材料，它们事实上为六——九个月（较少见）到二十四个月；最常见的是在十二——十八个月期内进行学习。
    社会主义工业的猛烈增长以及苏联国内失业现象的消灭提出了国家有组织的从城市和农村青年中训练新的工人的问题，建立劳动后备军的问题。
    一九四○年十月二日苏联最高苏维埃主席团根据斯大林的创议，曾公布“关于苏联国家劳动后备军”的命令，在这命令中说道：
    “进一步发展我们工业的任务，需要工人力量的经常涌入矿场、矿山、运输、工场及制造厂中。没有工人阶级成员的不断的补充，我们的工业的顺利的发展是不可能的。
    在我们国内，失业现象已经完全消灭了，城市与乡村中的贫穷与破产永远结束了，因此，在我们这里没有那些被迫到工厂和制造厂中去敲门和要求工作的人，从而自发地形成工业的经常劳动力后备军了。
    在这些条件下，国家便面临着一个任务，那便是从城市和农村青年中有组织地训练新的工人和建立工业所必要的劳动后备军。”
    这个命令规定设立：（一）两年制职业学校，以训练五金工人，冶炼工人，化学工业工人，矿山工人，石油工人及其他各种职业熟练工人；（二）两年修业期的铁路学校，以训练铁路运输熟练工人；（三）六月修业期的工厂艺徒学校，以训练群众性职业的工人。
    所有这些学校的学生，都是公费（免费学习，由国家供给膳食，服装，鞋履，衬衣，教科书和参考书，其他城市及来自农村的学生，还供给宿舍）。对于职业学校和铁路学校的学生，规定有制服。
    一九四○年十月二日的命令规定，每年号召（动员）八十万至一百万工人及农村青年在职业学校和铁路学校及工厂艺徒学校中学习。在这些学校毕业的学生必须在国营企业中工作四年，工资按一般的规定。
    依照苏联人民委员会一九四○年十月二日的决定，为了领导训练和分配国家劳动后备军，在苏联人民委员会之下，设立劳动后备军总管理局，于一九四六年改为苏联劳动后备总部。在各地方成立各共和国、各区、各省及各城市的劳动后备军管理局。
    训练熟练工人的新组织的主要特点，就是它在全国范围内的计划和重大的明确性。在以前，当这种训练交给工厂艺徒学校的时候，这些学校都是由个别企业办的，因此：（一）一些企业对于训练劳动力，表现了足够的注意，而另一些就很差，或者什么都不管；（二）在劳动力的训练中，在教学工作的内容和方法上，有很大的差异；（三）工厂艺徒学校的学生来源，几乎完全是青年工人；现在已广泛地包括了集体农庄的青年。
    在组织劳动后备军训练系统以后，就出现了一个有威望的强有力的组织上和教学方法上的领导中心——劳动后备军总管理局（现称部）。巨大的按步就班的力量吸收来了，训练和提高教师熟练程度的办法也有了。制定了全苏统一的课程和多数专业教学计划。保证了训练劳动后备军学校体系的强大物质基础。对于教育工作寄予极大的关注。并出版“生产教育”杂志。
    职业学校和铁路学校，招收十四——十五岁教育程度不低于小学（或十年制中学四年级）的男女少年。在这些学校里，依其专业，修业期继续两年——三年。
    显然，课程是按照各种不同的专业而不同的。为了了解学习的内容，在这里列举一些数字：职业学校两年修业期的教学时数（修理并装配检查调节器之专业）：
    一、生产工艺部分全部教学时数
    1.生产学习……………………二、二二五
    2.专门工艺学………………………二八六
    3.电工学及电工材料学……………一三八
    二、一般技术及一般教育部分周期全部教学时数
    1.制图…………………………………八六
    2.数学………………………………二○七
    3.物理学……………………………一一二
    4.俄文………………………………一九○
    5.政治学科…………………………一六四
    三、军事——体育训练一六四总计三、五七二
    这样，普通教育的部分和体育差不多占百分之二十五，而生产工艺的教育，将近百分之七十五。一学年分为四段。七月中每周生产教学作业进行仅十八小时，而在八月中，完全放假。学习日为七小时，其中两小时为普通教育和专门学科的课目，五小时为工厂中的生产学习。
    生产学习在实习工厂和工厂各部中进行，对于这些工厂的良好设备，予以巨大的注意的。
    职业和铁路学校的毕业生，发给专门技术熟练工作证书。在这些学校毕业的青年工人，有了取第四级至第五级钳工、镟工以及其他等等资格，由劳动后备部派到生产中去，在那里以斯达哈诺夫运动的方法工作，每月可以得到一千卢布或更高的工资。
    工厂艺徒学校招收年龄十六——十七岁的学生。学习期限为六个月至一年按其专业而定。工厂艺徒学校的教学计划包括生产学习及一百小时的最低限度的技术理论。
    职业学校或铁路学校及工厂艺徒学校，由校长领导；生产学习工作，由学校生产教学部主任领导；教育工作，由政治部分的副校长领导。在校长之下设有一个评议机构——学校生产教学会议。
    在职业、铁路学校和工厂艺徒学校中，进行巨大的教育工作以提高学生的政治思想水平，巩固自觉的纪律，发展学生的意志和性格、主动性与创造性之布尔塞维克的特点，培养品行和生活态度，并进行艺术教育，及军事——体育训练等等。
    在这一教育工作中，共青团组织起着重要的作用。
    一九四四年七月二十二日，共青团中央作出了一系列指示，以加强共青团组织在职业学校，铁路学校和工厂艺徒学校中的教育工作。这些组织要全力巩固学校及工厂艺徒学校领导者、技师、教师、教育人员的威望，要帮助他们的工作，要在改善政治工作、群众文教工作及军事体育工作中表现广大的创造性、积极性，要组织文学晚会、好书展览以促进学生的读书兴趣，要在帮助图书馆宣传书籍等等。
    职业学校、铁路学校及工厂艺徒学校中举行政治问题和科学主题的讲演和报告，组织小组（合唱、音乐、戏剧等）及具有滑冰、击剑、拳术等部分的体育队。并成立了全苏运动协会“劳动后备军”。为了庆祝共青团成立二十五周年，一九四三年秋天曾在莫斯科举行了劳动后备学校业余艺术表演，全苏各队都参加了这个表演。这个表演是在很高的水平上进行的，对于歌曲、音乐作品、舞蹈、技艺都作了艺术的演出。
    劳动后备体系的学校，在伟大的卫国战争时期曾进行了巨大的工作。学校数量在战争年间从一五五○增到二五七○。虽然训练劳动后备军系统存在的最初五年，除了最初几个月以外，是在战争的沉重条件下渡过的，但是苏维埃政府对这个训练仍毫不吝惜予以财政上的帮助。从一九四○年十月到一九四五年十月五年内为此支出的总额，达一百一十亿卢布，其中膳食费为四十六亿，社会卫生措施费用为二亿四千万。在学生被服方面共费了两亿公尺的毛织物和棉织物等等。为劳动后备体系的学生及工作人员共开设了十五所休养院及休养处等等。
    劳动后备体系学校之最初五年，共造就了二百二十五万熟练工人及多种职业的工人，而其中二百万是在伟大的卫国战争时期中受教育的。
    职业学校、铁路学校及工厂艺徒学校的学生，这些青年男女们，一方面学习，一方面制造许多具有国防意义的产品。许多劳动后备体系学校的学生，都参加了抗击德国侵略者的战役，这些学校有二十三位学生由于在卫国战争前线上所表现的英勇果敢，而获得了苏联英雄这样崇高的称号。
    最近几年，苏联在训练劳动后备军方面已经作了许多事情，而且尚有更多的事要作。一九四六年九月三十日苏联部长会议的决议，指出了改善这种训练的一系列的重要措施，并责成劳动后备部在职业学校、铁路学校及工厂艺徒学校里要造就下列数量的熟练工人：
    一九四六年…………………四五○、○○○人
    一九四七年…………………七六○、○○○人
    一九四八年…………………九八○、○○○人
    一九四九年……………一、○九○、○○○人
    一九五○年……………一、二五○、○○○人而在第四个斯大林五年计划期内共造就四百五十万熟练工人。
    除了劳动后备部的学校作为造就熟练工人的主干运河外，初级职业教育也在多数企业附设的职工学校、初级技术知识学习组以及各种短期训练班里进行。
  （二）中等职业教育
    工业、建设、运输、交通、农业的各种部门的中等资格专门人才，是在技术专科学校里造就的。中等医药人员（医生助手、助产士），在医药学校里培植；初级学校的教师在师范学校里培植等等。
    十月革命以前中等职业教育是很薄弱的。
    一九一四年在二九五个中等职业学校中统共只有三五、八○○个学生。而社会主义工业、农业及文化的飞跃发展，便为苏联高等、以及中等职业教育的蓬勃增长，创设了条件。
    苏联技术专科学校及其他中等职业学校在数目上的猛烈增长开始于一九三○——三一学年。在一九二九——三○年度，苏联共有一一一五个中等职业学校，而在下一个年度即一九三○——三一年度，已有二九五五个，在一九三八——三九年度已有三七三二个了。
    而且这些学校中的学生平均数（容纳量），不论是以前的或者是新开办的学校，都骤然提高了。革命以前每个中等职业学校平均容纳学生一二一名。在二十世纪的二十年代则升到一七○——一九○名（一九二九——三○学年达一九六名），而在一九三八——三九学年升到二五五名。
    学校数量及其容纳量的增大使学生数目大为提高了。
    在一九三八——三九年度，技术专科学校、医药学校、师范学校及其他中等职业学校学习的共有九五一、九○○位学生，这就是说中等职业学校学生数目比较革命以前增大了二六·六倍。
    中等职业学校学生中，女性占很大的百分数。在一九二八年，她们在工业、建筑和运输技术专科学校中占百分之九·五，而在一九三八年便占百分之二五·九；在农业技术专科学校里，女生的百分数在同一时期内从一五·四增加到二八·七。
    按照专业来分，一九三八——三九年度中等职业学校学生分配如下：
    保健……………………二六三、三九七  百分之二七·七
    教育（初级学校教师、幼稚教育工作者、图书馆工作者）
    …………………………二五五、九六二  百分之二六·八
    工业和建设……………一七三、二○二  百分之一八·三
    农业……………………一三六、九二二  百分之一四·四
    运输和交通………………六二、六五三    百分之六·六
    社会经济类………………三○、○三二    百分之三·一
    艺术………………………二九、七一七  或百分之三·一
    正如高等学校一样，技术专科学校及其他中等职业学校也是多少均等地分布在各加盟共和国里。中等资格的专门干部，是从各民族的青年中来培养的。譬如，一九三九年格鲁吉亚共和国有二一四所中等职业学校，乌兹别克共和国有一○六所中等职业学校，哈萨克共和国有一一六所中等职业学校，塔吉克共和国有二九所中等职业学校。
    中等职业学校的主要形式为：修业期限三年或四年的技术专科学校（工业、运输、农业等等），修业期限三年或四年的学校（师范、音乐等），修业期限三年的学校（医药、法律等）。
    中等职业学校招收年龄从十四岁到三十岁，具有中等学校七年级教育程度的男女青年。有志入学者须经过入学测验。
    中等职业学校的课程包括：（一）一般教育课目（文学、数学、自然科学、物理学、化学等），这些课目之学习，扩大学生在七年制学校中所获得的一般教育；（二）相应于该中等职业学校专业的专门课目；（三）生产实习，它在课程中占重要的地位。
    许多技术专科学校具有装备优良的实验室、研究室和工厂。在这些学校里，未来的技师们一方面凭借讲义、听课、研究室及实验室的作业而获得理论上的修养；另一方面又由实验室、教学工厂和农场的作业（教学实习）及在企业和国营农场等里的作业（生产实习）而获得实践的修养。
    很大的注意力是放在教育工作上面，那便是提高思想政治水平，发展辩证唯物主义世界观，发展对祖国的爱，培养意志、进取心、责任感、对自己职业的爱好，以及体育。在这个教育工作里，共青团组织起着重大的作用。
    课外的及校外的工作，如群众的（晚会、演讲会、旅行团等），及小组的，都是广泛地进行的。
    成绩优异的学生都有津贴。别的城市的及自乡村来的学生，则有公共宿舍。
    修业期满的学生，须参加国家考试，或在国家资格委员会里作毕业设计。
    毕业学生以中等资格专门人材按专业分配工作。
    在资本主义国家里，中等职业学校乃是绝路，这些学校的毕业生是不被容许去受进一步的高等教育的。但在苏联，就不是这样了，毕业于技术专科学校、师范学校、医药及其他学校的中等资格的专家，都有可能在高等学校里继续学习（按选定的专业）。他们按照自己的专业作实践工作继续三年以上之后，便可以参加高等学校的入学测验。中等职业学校成绩优异的毕业生，若干百分比（通常是百分之五）有权在毕业后立即进入大学，而无须经过实践服务期。这一项权利之被允许，便说明了苏维埃政府对于具有天才的青年之关切。
    许多技术专科学校都组织了函授教育及夜校部。中等职业学校一般组织上和方法上的领导由高等教育部实行，而经济上、财政上的管理，及教学工作的直接领导则属于专科职业学校所从属的部或其他政府机关。（本文系米丁斯基所著“苏联人民教育”一书的一章）
