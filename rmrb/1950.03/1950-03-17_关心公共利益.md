　　Concerning Public Interest, Editor:
    Recently, I saw several incidents in Beijing concerning the public interest of the people, and I am writing them down as a reference for relevant departments.
    I.  Beijing is currently mobilizing to build air-raid shelters everywhere. In many places on Mishi Street and North Chang Street, because of the poor use of open spaces and being too close to trees, tree roots are in a chaotic state all over the ground. Some people even deliberately build shelters under larger trees, using the support of the intertwined roots, and consequently cut off the main roots that are several inches in diameter, causing the branches to sway in the wind, appearing as if they are about to fall. In addition, outside the wall of the Academy of Sciences, there is a row of neat and lush locust trees. Many children gathering firewood climb the trees, sawing and chopping indiscriminately. People entering and leaving the academy, as well as guards on duty, turn a blind eye to it. The trees on the tree-lined avenues to the left and right of the Forbidden City are also often pilfered for firewood and climbed on, with no one stopping them.
    II. The area around the eastern wall of the Temple of Heaven used to have a thick layer of loess protecting it. Recently, I have seen many people digging and taking soil there, with large and small carts carrying it away fully loaded, leaving the base of the altar full of holes. If this is not stopped as soon as possible, once a large-scale collapse occurs and repairs have to be made, the cost will be enormous.

　　关心公共利益编辑同志：
    最近我在北京看到几桩有关人民公共利益的事件，写出来作为有关部门的参考。
    一、北京市内各处现正动员修筑防空壕井，在米市大街和北长街有不少地方，因为不善利用隙地，过于靠近树木，搞得树根满地狼藉。甚至有人故意在较大的树下，利用盘根的支架，建设洞棚，因而把直径数寸的主根也给截断，致使枝干临风招展，大有摇摇欲坠之势。另外在科学院的墙外，有一列整齐茂密的槐树，许多检柴儿童攀登树上，乱锯乱砍，院中出入人等以及值岗警兵，一概熟视无睹。故宫左右林荫大道上的林木，也时常被人采樵攀折，无人制止。
    二、天坛东墙根一带，原有很厚的黄土培护着。近见许多人在那里挖掘取土，大车小辆，满载而去，弄的坛根千疮百孔。若不及早制止，一旦大批倒塌，动工整修，所费必巨。
