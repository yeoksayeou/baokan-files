Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th: The first National Traffic Quarantine Conference convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government concluded on the 4th of this month, after opening on February 27th. The conference was attended by representatives from quarantine stations in seaports of Northeast, North, East and South China, representatives from the Ministry of Health of the Central-South and Southwest regions, and representatives from relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Administration of Customs, and the Civil Aviation Administration, totaling more than 40 people. The conference reviewed and summarized the quarantine work in China over the past several decades and determined that the future direction of traffic quarantine should be to prevent infectious disease epidemics and protect people's health.

The conference heard reports from representatives from various regions on past quarantine work. The reports pointed out that quarantine work in the past several decades served imperialism. For example, at the Shanghai Quarantine Station, prior to 1930, whether foreign ships were quarantined was entirely decided by foreign consuls. Foreigners entering the country could enjoy privileges, even exemption from inspection; but Chinese citizens going abroad were often subjected to humiliation due to quarantine. The Kuomintang's quarantine work either devolved into perfunctory officialdom or corruption and malfeasance. For example, quarantine personnel at the Tianjin Quarantine Station, upon discovering corpses on ships during inspections, accepted bribes and allowed passage unconditionally. Other phenomena such as harassing and extorting passengers and colluding with shipping companies to smuggle goods were even more widespread. Fumigation work was also not thorough, as evidenced by the discovery of live rats on ships after fumigation at the Tianjin and Fuzhou quarantine stations.

Representatives from the Northeast gave a typical report on quarantine work at the meeting. Representatives from the Andong Quarantine Station introduced their method of conducting quarantine in conjunction with the dockworkers' union and the seafarers' union. Before preventive injections, they used workers' evening gatherings and forums to conduct publicity and education, and organized workers for collective injections. Representatives from the Dalian Quarantine Station gave a general introduction to the Soviet quarantine system. Soviet quarantine staff gave passengers as much convenience as possible during quarantine, while striving for precision and speed in their work. They conducted detailed inspections of the ship's dining room, latrines, cabins, rat holes, etc., and made full use of the time. Ships were inspected immediately upon arrival; at the same time, passengers were not refused disembarkation due to the ship's violation of quarantine regulations. In addition to a health certificate for entry and exit, a health assessment book was kept for ship hygiene inspections, detailing the ship's hygiene conditions for reference by other ports.

The conference conducted group discussions on draft regulations such as the "Rules for Health Examination of Foreigners Entering the Country," the "Outline of Traffic Quarantine Regulations," the "Regulations on the Organization of Quarantine Stations," and the "Rules on Ship Hygiene Management," and put forward opinions. Preliminary decisions were also made on issues such as unified leadership, unified rules and regulations and technical standards, increasing technical equipment, and publishing quarantine books and periodicals.

　　防止传染病流行保障人民健康
    卫生部召开交通检疫会议
    就统一领导及增加技术设备等问题作了决定
    【新华社北京十三日电】中央人民政府卫生部召开的全国第一次交通检疫会议，自二月二十七日开幕至本月四日结束。出席会议的有东北、华北、华东、华南各海港检疫所的代表，中南、西南区卫生部代表和铁道部、公安部、外交部、海关总署、民航局等各有关机关代表共四十余人。会议检讨并总结了中国过去数十年以来的检疫工作，并确定了今后的交通检疫应以防止传染病流行，保障人民健康为工作方向。
    会议听取了各地代表关于过去检疫工作的汇报。汇报中指出：过去数十年来的检疫工作，是为帝国主义而服务的。如上海检疫所，在一九三○年以前，对外国船只已否检疫，全由外国领事决定。外人入境可享特权，甚至免于检查；但中国人出国则常因检疫而受到侮辱。国民党的检疫工作不是流于形式的官样文章就是贪污舞弊。如天津检疫所检疫人员到船上检查发现死尸，接受了贿赂，就无条件通过。其他刁难勒索旅客、勾结轮船公司带货走私等现象更是普遍存在。对于薰船工作也不彻底，如天津、福州检疫所在薰船后，仍发现船上有活老鼠的事情。
    东北代表在会上作了检疫工作的典型报告。安东检疫所的代表介绍了他们结合码头工会和海员工会进行检疫的办法。在预防注射前，他们利用工人的晚会、座谈会的方式，进行宣传教育，组织工人集体注射。大连检疫所的代表概括地介绍了苏联检疫制度。苏联检疫工作人员在检疫时，尽量给旅客方便，但工作则力求精细和迅速，对于船上饭堂、便所、船室、鼠洞等处都作详细检查，并充分抓紧时间，船只到埠，立即进行检查；同时也没有因船只违犯检疫规则而拒绝旅客上陆的情事发生，对于船只卫生检查，除了出入口健康证明书外，另有一个卫生鉴定簿，对该船的卫生情况记载很详，以供其他港口检查的参考。
    会议对于《外人入境健康检查规则》、《交通检疫章程纲要》、《检疫所组织条例》和《船只管理卫生规则》等草案，都进行了分组讨论，并提出意见。关于统一领导、统一规章制度和技术水平、增设技术设备、出版检疫书刊等问题也都作了初步的决定。
