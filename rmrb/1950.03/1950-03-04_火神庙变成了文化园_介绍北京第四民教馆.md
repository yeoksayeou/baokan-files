　　The Fire God Temple Transformed into a Cultural Garden
    ——Introducing the Beijing Fourth People's Education Center
    Bai Rong　Jiang Xia
    The Fire God Temple in Liulichang, Ninth District of Beijing, still held a dust-covered statue of a god until October of last year. Before that, every New Year, many superstitious men and women would come to burn incense and seek "blessings." Last October, with the birth of the People's Republic of China, this temple was transformed into a place for the working people to learn culture.
            Starting from Scratch
    Last August, the Municipal Education Bureau sent three cadres to the Ninth District to establish the Fourth People's Education Center. At the time, there was nothing. The cadres solicited opinions from the public in many ways: should we keep this lifeless temple, or should we use it to run a People's Education Center? The masses resolutely supported the latter. With the help of the masses, in less than two months, this Fire God Temple was completely transformed: all the statues of gods in the hall were removed. The main hall was converted into a reading room for books and newspapers; the south hall became a recreation room; the west hall was converted into a photo exhibition room; and the east wing was a children's reading room. Bookcases, newspaper racks, ping-pong tables, and five or six hundred popular books and seven newspapers were initially purchased. Electric lights and stoves were installed in each room. On a tall shrine in the main hall that could not be removed, the masses themselves wrote a large horizontal banner: "Study, study, and study again." Two maps to help with learning were hung in front of the shrine. After this renovation, it became a very comfortable place to study. After the opening in October of last year, the masses showed the greatest enthusiasm and care for it. There were no tables and chairs in the center, so the masses brought them from their own homes to lend; the People's Education Center had very few books, and nearby bookstores generously donated 693 volumes; a citizen named Su Yifan donated approximately two thousand books, including his family's collection of the "Complete Library," and a mimeograph machine, and a young worker from a printing factory said when donating books to the center: "I have already read these books, and I am willing to put them in the People's Education Center so that everyone can read them!"
            A Big Family
    The People's Education Center has now become the center for the surrounding citizens to learn culture and entertainment, and a happy big family. Shop assistants, housewives, small merchants, vendors, from white-haired old men to six-year-old children, four or five hundred people come to the center every day to read books, newspapers, and enjoy entertainment. Citizens in groups of four or five up to ten have organized study groups and newspaper reading groups. Under the guidance of the cadres in the center, they regularly organize study and discussion in rotation. In order to better help them learn, the center has set up a question and answer box. The questions raised by the citizens are very wide-ranging: learning, hygiene, common knowledge of nature… all kinds of questions. The staff of the center can answer them patiently one by one, or send them to the relevant authorities for answers, until they are satisfied.
    Popular books and comic strips are the most popular with the citizens. Especially "The White-Haired Girl," "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "New Drum Lyrics," and comic strips like "Heroes of Lüliang" and "The 25,000-Li Long March." Although several copies of each of these books have been prepared, they are always in the hands of readers every day, and they are in great demand. In the children's reading room, there are up to four hundred children reading books on a single day. A vendor named Kong was very moved after reading "Heroes of Lüliang" and said: I now know that it was the People's Liberation Army that fought the Japanese devils! With the assistance of the North China Pictorial Publishing House, the center has held exhibitions on the lives of workers in the liberated areas, the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China, the Beijing Municipal Sports Meeting, and the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, which have been well received by the masses. A total of three sessions were held, with 12,189 visitors.
    In order to develop the cultural and recreational activities of the citizens, in addition to regularly holding film evenings and public lectures, the citizens themselves have also organized a club, which performs old-style and new-content singing, drum performance, and cross-talk programs every Sunday evening. At one evening party, Cao Baolin's cross-talk "Feudal Marriage" received a storm of applause from the masses. The center is currently planning to organize more new-content drum performances and "pulling foreign films" shows, and to produce serial cartoons to coincide with current events. In addition, in order to send books and newspapers to the masses, a mobile reading station has also been established in the teahouse some distance away. The business of the teahouses where reading stations have been established has immediately improved compared to before. The books in the mobile reading station are frequently changed. Now, as soon as the staff of the center arrives, the masses immediately surround them and ask: "Are there any new books?" Because the staff truly established close ties with the masses, the People's Education Center has gradually become a big family for the local citizens to learn and entertain themselves.
            Making Friends
    Because there are few staff members and a lot of work, they are too busy, they launched a "making friends" campaign. They made many friends through adult night schools, home visits, and conversations with people who came to the center; they discovered activists from these friends and helped them with their work. Currently, more than a dozen citizens have voluntarily requested to provide free service. A housewife named Liu Fenglan now comes to the center every day to work for four hours. They manage the reading room, recreation room, and photo exhibition room as if they were managing their own housework. In the children's reading room, twenty children have organized themselves to take turns guarding and managing it in an orderly manner. In addition, the masses' own organizations also include a bulletin board committee and a serial cartoon creation team.
    In order to further develop this People's Education Center, there are still some areas that need to be improved: (1) The center should appropriately increase the supply of popular books and comic strips that the masses like most, in order to meet their needs. (2) At present, not many rickshaw pullers and other coolies come to the center. In the future, we must try to encourage them to come to the People's Education Center in order to expand the influence of new democratic cultural education.

　　火神庙变成了文化园
    ——介绍北京第四民教馆
    白融　江夏
    北京九区琉璃厂的火神庙，去年十月以前还高坐着全身积满灰尘的神像。再以前，每逢过年，还有许多迷信神佛的男女到来烧香求“福”。去年十月，随着中华人民共和国的诞生，这座庙宇也变成了劳动人民学习文化的场所。
            空手起家
    去年八月，市教育局派了三个干部到九区来，要成立第四民教馆。当时什么也没有。干部们曾多方面征求市民意见：到底是保持这座死气沉沉的庙宇呢，还是要利用它办一个民教馆？群众坚决地拥护了后者。经过群众的协助，不到两个月，这座火神庙就完全变了样：殿内的神像全部拆除了。正殿改成了书报阅览室；南殿做了游艺室；西大殿改成照片展览室；东厢房是儿童阅览室。并初步地购置了书架、报架、乒乓球台以及五、六百册通俗读物和七种报纸。各屋都装上了电灯、火炉。在正殿一个不能拆去的高大的神龛上，群众自己写了一斗大字的横幅标语：“学习，学习，再学习”。神龛的前面挂着两幅帮助学习用的地图。经过这一整顿，便成了一个很舒适的学习所在。去年十月间开馆后，群众对它表示了最大的热情和爱护。馆内没有桌凳，群众就从自己家里拿出来借用；民教馆书籍很少，附近各书店纷纷慷慨捐赠了六百九十三册；市民苏毅范把自己家藏的《万有文库》等书约两千余册，及油印机一部，全部捐赠，一个印刷厂的小工友在赠给馆内书籍时说：“这些书我已经读完了，我愿意把它放在民教馆里让大家都看！”
            大家庭
    民教馆现在已经成了附近市民学习文化和娱乐的中心，成了一个快乐的大家庭。店员、家庭妇女、小商人、摊贩，从白发老人到六岁儿童，每天要有四、五百人到馆里来看书、看报和娱乐。并有市民由四五人到十人组织起学习小组，读报小组、在馆内干部的指导下，经常轮流组织学习讨论。为了更好地帮助他们学习，馆内设了问答箱。市民提出的问题非常广泛：学习、卫生、自然常识……各种问题。馆内工作人员都能一一耐心解答，或送到有关机关解答，一直到他们认为满意为止。
    通俗读物和连环画最受市民欢迎。尤其是白毛女、血泪仇、新大鼓词和连环画吕梁英雄传、两万五千里长征等书。这些书虽然每种预备了好几册，每天却总是在读者手里，应接不暇。儿童阅览室里，最多时一天有四百个小朋友来看书。一个姓孔的摊贩看了《吕梁英雄传》后很感动地说：我现在才晓得打日本鬼子是解放军的功劳啊！该馆在华北画报社协助下，三个月来先后举行了解放区工人生活、中华人民共和国开国典礼、北京市体育大会和抗日战争、解放战争等展览，深受群众欢迎。前后共举办三次，参观者达一二、一八九人。
    为了开展市民的文娱活动，除了定期举办电影晚会和大众讲座以外，市民自己还组织了一个俱乐部，每星期日晚间演出旧形式新内容的清唱、大鼓、相声等节目。在一次晚会上，曹保林的相声《封建婚姻》受到群众狂风暴雨般的鼓掌。该馆现正计划组织更多新内容的大鼓、拉洋片、配合时事出连环漫画。此外，为了将书报送到群众手中，在距离较远的茶铺里，还成立了巡回阅览站。凡成立阅览站的茶铺，生意立即较前兴隆。巡回阅览站的书籍是经常调换的。现在馆内的工作人员一去，群众立刻就围上去问：“有新书来了没有？”由于工作人员真正的深入联系了群众，民教馆已逐渐成为该地市民学习和娱乐的大家庭了。
            交朋友
    由于工作人员少，工作多，忙不过来，他们曾发动过一个“交朋友”运动。通过成人夜校、家庭访问、与来馆的人交谈等方式结交了很多朋友；从这些朋友中发现积极分子，帮助工作。目前已有十几位市民自动地要求义务服务。有一位家庭妇女叫刘凤兰的，她现在每天到馆做四个钟头的工作。他们像管理自己的家务一样的管理着阅览室、游艺室、照片展览室。儿童阅览室里，更有二十位小朋友组织起来轮流看守，管理得有条不紊。此外，群众自己的组织还有壁报委员会、连环画创作组。
    为使这一民教馆更加发展，目前还有一些需要改进的地方：（一）通俗读物连环图画等群众最喜欢的读物，应在可能的条件下适当增加，以满足他们的需要。（二）目前三轮车夫及其他苦力工人来馆的还不多，今后要设法鼓励他们到民教馆来，以便扩大新民主主义文化教育的影响。
