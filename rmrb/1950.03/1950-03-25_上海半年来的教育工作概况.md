　　Overview of Shanghai's Education Work in the Past Six Months
     Xinhua News Agency
    Shanghai is a city with relatively developed culture and education in China. It has 44 public and private universities and colleges, 282 secondary schools, 1,113 primary schools, and 199 employee supplementary schools. The city has 22,418 university students, 98,000 middle school students, and 382,000 primary school students. The Shanghai education community had a glorious tradition of struggle in the past, but at the same time, it was also deeply poisoned by the ideologies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, after the liberation of Shanghai, the people's government's education authorities, from the beginning of the takeover, adopted the principle of "maintaining the status quo and gradually transforming," based on the fundamental spirit of "improving the people's cultural level, cultivating talents for national construction, eradicating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and developing the idea of serving the people."

    The transformation of schools generally goes through the following steps:

    (1) The central link in the transformation of schools is to conduct political and ideological education for teachers and students. Schools universally offer political courses or political common sense courses to conduct systematic political and ideological education for students and carry out various social activities. In the past six months, students' political understanding and ideological awareness have made significant progress, and the general student view of despising labor has been initially corrected. However, due to the small number and insufficient quality of political teachers, serious dogmatism has been manifested in teaching, failing to connect with reality, solve students' difficulties, and correct students' incorrect thinking. In major universities and colleges, due to the lack of political professors, the method of giving large lectures is generally adopted, and a few political teaching assistants are added to assist in organizing student learning.

    In terms of improving the quality of teachers, the Shanghai Education Bureau held a large-scale research conference last summer and trained nearly 200 political teachers. Teachers in each school universally organized study groups for regular learning. In addition, teaching research associations and weekly lectures were established for subjects such as literature, history, and biology. More than 3,000 teachers attended each lecture. The Military Control Commission's Higher Education Department also regularly held joint symposiums for political professors and teaching assistants. During the winter vacation, political teaching assistants underwent collective learning. After collective learning and practical participation in various mass movements, teachers generally were able to have a simple style, work actively, and study hard.

    (2) Reforming the leadership organizations of public schools and some private schools, universally establishing democratic centralized school affairs committees, absorbing progressive teachers and student representatives from the schools to participate in school administration, uniting all teachers, students, and staff to jointly improve the school. In terms of democratic management, organizations such as student unions, the New Democratic Youth League, and the Young Pioneers have gradually overcome the tendency toward extreme democratization in the early days of liberation.

    In major universities and colleges, due to the irrationality of the Kuomintang's education system in the past and the practice of setting up departments based on individuals, the departments and faculties were overlapping. After the takeover, some departments and faculties were merged in various universities and colleges: for example, the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, and Commerce of Jinan University were merged into Fudan University, the College of Science was merged into Jiaotong University, and Anthropology was merged into Zhejiang University; Jinan University will be restored as an Overseas Chinese school. The Department of Aquaculture of Fudan University was transferred to Shandong University, and the Department of Oceanography was merged into the Department of Aquaculture of Shandong University. The Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law of Tongji University were merged into Fudan University. In this way, talents are concentrated, and the education system is more rational. The people's government has made appropriate arrangements for the surplus faculty and staff after the merger of various universities and colleges.

    In addition to ordering the closure of the three reactionary middle schools of Zhongzheng, Qingbai, and Qingnian, the Shanghai Education Bureau sent personnel to assist in reorganizing eleven middle schools and thirteen primary schools due to the escape of principals or corruption in school administration. Under the supervision of the government and the assistance of teachers and students, most private schools have moved toward economic openness and democratic leadership.

    (3) In terms of curriculum reform, all schools have uniformly cancelled reactionary courses such as civics, party doctrine, military training, and Boy Scouts. For church schools, it is stipulated that students cannot be forced to believe in religion and religion must not be listed as a required course. In terms of teaching materials, new textbooks have been fully adopted in primary schools; in secondary schools, except for natural science courses, most business courses, and some geography courses that still use old textbooks, the remaining courses have all been replaced with temporarily compiled new textbooks. In the first semester, the focus of curriculum reform in universities and colleges was on the liberal arts and law colleges. As for the science, engineering, agriculture, and medical colleges, the Military Control Commission's Higher Education Department has put forward the requirements to reduce unnecessary courses, merge courses with similar natures, focus on teaching based on urgency and importance, improve internships, and reduce the burden on students in order to maintain the health of students.

    In terms of social education, the Shanghai Education Bureau will develop education for workers, peasants, and laborers. All past private schools have been changed into worker night schools or worker-peasant schools and moved into factory areas. There are 112 worker-peasant schools in the city, with 30,594 workers and peasants enrolled. In order to enable young workers and unemployed youth to have the opportunity to receive education, in addition to employee supplementary schools, seven night middle schools have also been established, with 2,079 students. 626 children's evening classes were held, enrolling 10,742 children of workers. In order to improve the cultural and professional level of in-service cadres, a joint agency school was also established.

    In addition, mass culture centers, libraries, museums, stadiums, etc., have all changed their past policies and serve the working people. The mass culture center has also organized a film team to regularly show movies in factories and hold various exhibitions, carnivals, lectures, and other regular cultural and artistic activities. An average of more than a thousand citizens visit and listen to lectures every day. The library has also added twelve mobile stations to provide citizens with reading materials. The stadium actively promotes mass sports and held a sports meeting with more than 8,000 participants.

　　上海半年来的教育工作概况
     新华社
    上海是我国文化教育较发达的城市，有公私立大专院校四十四所，中等学校二百八十二所，小学一千一百一十三所，职工补习学校一百九十九所；全市有大学生二万二千四百十八人，中学生九万八千人，小学生三十八万二千人。上海教育界过去具有光荣的斗争传统，但同时受帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的思想毒害也最深，因此上海解放后，人民政府教育行政当局从接管时开始，即本“提高人民文化水平、培养国家建设人才、肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想”这一基本精神，采取了维持原状、逐步改造的方针。
    学校改造工作，一般是通过下列几个步骤：
    （一）改造学校的中心环节，是对师生进行政治思想教育。各校普遍开设政治课或政治常识课，对学生进行有系统的政治思想教育和开展各种社会活动。半年多来，学生的政治认识与思想意识已有显著进步，初步纠正了一般学生轻视劳动的观点。但由于政治教员的数量少和质量不够高，因此在教学中表现了严重的教条主义，不能结合实际，解决学生的疑难和纠正学生的不正确思想。在各大专院校，由于政治教授的缺乏，一般都采用上大课办法，并增添少数政治助教，协助组织同学学习。
    在提高教师质量方面，去年暑假上海市教育局曾举办了大规模的研究会，并培养政治教员近二百人。各校教员普遍组织学习小组，进行经常性的学习。此外，又成立文、史、生物等各科教学研究会和星期讲座，每次前往听讲的教师都在三千人以上。军管会高等教育处并定期举行政治教授、助教的联合座谈会；寒假中政治助教进行了集体学习，教师们经过集体学习和实际参加各种群众运动的锻炼后，一般都能作风朴素、积极工作、和努力学习。
    （二）改造公立学校及部分私立学校的领导机构，普遍建立民主集中制的校务委员会，吸收学校中的进步教师和学生代表参加学校行政，团结全校师生员工，共同改进学校。在民主管理方面，通过学生会、新民主主义青年团及少年儿童队等组织，已逐步克服了解放初期的极端民主化偏向。
    各大专院校，由于过去国民党教育制度的不合理以及因人设事的作风，致使院系重叠设置。接管后对各院校进行了部分的系院合并：如暨南大学的文、法、商学院并入了复旦大学，理学院并入了交通大学，人类学并入浙江大学；暨南大学将恢复为华侨学校。复旦大学的水产系归入山东大学，海洋系并入山东大学水产系。同济大学文、法学院并入复旦大学。这样，使人材集中，教育制度更为合理。各院校合并后多余的教职员，人民政府都予以适当的安置。
    私立学校除勒令中正、青白、青年三所反动中学停办外，上海市教育局派员协助整理了因校长潜逃或校政腐败的中学十一所和小学十三所。在政府督促和师生协助下，绝大部分私立学校已走向经济公开和领导民主的道路。
    （三）课程改革方面，各校一律取消了反动的公民、党义、军训、童子军等课程。对教会学校则规定不能强迫学生信教并不得把宗教列为必修课；教材方面，小学已全部采用新教本；中等学校除自然科学课和大部分业务和部分地理课仍采用旧教本外，其余课程已全部改用临时编的新教本。上学期大专校课程改革的重点是在文法学院，至于理、工、农、医等院的课程，军管会高等教育处已提出准备减少不必要的课程、合并性质相同的课程的精简要求；同时分别缓急重点授课，改善实习，减轻学生的负担，以保持学生身体的健康。
    社会教育工作方面，上海市教育局将开展工农劳动人民教育。过去的民校一律改为工人夜校或工农学校，迁入工厂区。全市工农学校一百十二所，入学的工农达三万零五百九十四人。为使青年职工和失学青年能得到受教育的机会，除职工补习学校外，并建立了七所夜中学，有学生二千零七十九名。举办了儿童晚班六百二十六班，招收工人子弟一万零七百四十二名。为提高在职干部的文化、业务水平，又举办了一所联合机关学校。
    此外，对群众文化馆、图书馆、博物馆、体育场等，都已改变过去方针，而为劳动人民服务。群众文化馆并组织了电影队，经常到工厂放映电影，并举办各种展览会、游艺会、演讲会等经常性的文化艺术活动，平均每日有市民千余人前往参观和听讲。图书馆也添设了十二所流动站，供应市民阅览。体育馆积极推动人民大众的体育运动，曾举办一次八千余人的运动大会。
