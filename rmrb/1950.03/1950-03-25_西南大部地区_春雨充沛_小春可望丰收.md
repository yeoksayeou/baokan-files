　　Southwest China in Most Areas
    Abundant Spring Rain
    Good Harvest Expected for Spring Crops

    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Most areas of Southwest China have abundant spring rain, and a good harvest of spring crops is expected (spring crops refer to crops harvested in spring, including wheat, barley, buckwheat, oats, broad beans, peas, rapeseed, etc.). Since the first month of the lunar year, most areas of northern Sichuan have had three rainfalls, and the spring harvest in Nanchong and other places can reach 60% to 70%. The spring harvest in Luxian area of southern Sichuan can reach 80%. Near Kunming, Yunnan, the spring harvest can reach 70% to 80%. Only Guizhou Province is slightly lacking in spring rain, and the harvest may be worse than in previous years (estimated to be about 60% of the previous year's harvest). The Guizhou Provincial People's Government is now calling on cadres at all levels to organize farmers to plant early-maturing crops to shorten the spring famine.

    【新华社重庆二十四日电】西南大部地区春雨充沛，小春可望丰收（小春系指春季收获之作物，包括小麦、大麦、荞麦、燕麦、蚕豆、豌豆、油菜籽等）。川北各专区正月以来，大部地区落雨三次，南充等地小春收成可达六至七成。川南沪县一带小春可收八成。云南昆明附近，小春收成可达七、八成。仅贵州各地春雨稍缺，收成可能较往年为差（估计约为往年收成的六成）。现贵州省人民政府正在号召各级工作干部组织农民播种早熟作物，以缩短春荒。
