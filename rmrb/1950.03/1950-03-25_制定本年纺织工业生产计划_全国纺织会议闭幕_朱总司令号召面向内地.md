Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The National Public-Owned Textile Conference, convened by the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, concluded on the 22nd after twenty-one days. The conference discussed and decided on the 1950 textile industry's production plan, unified leadership and unified textile administrative organization, operating standards and financial systems, employee wage standards and labor insurance, welfare, democratization of factory management, and fiber inspection, among other issues.

During the conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Minister of Labor Li Lisan, and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Textile Workers' Union Chen Shaomin all attended and gave speeches. Commander-in-Chief Zhu pointed out in his speech: The textile industry is a relatively well-established industry in China's existing industry. In order to get rid of the semi-colonial deformed development, it should focus on the interior and the countryside in the future, and serve the broad masses of the people practically. He called on everyone to work hard to produce, accumulate funds, and gradually embark on the road of self-reliance. Minister of Labor Li Lisan and Director Chen Shaomin of the Preparatory Committee of the Textile Workers' Union gave detailed explanations in their speeches on issues such as the democratization of factory management, rational adjustment of wages, accumulation of funds, and completion of state production tasks. The representatives unanimously expressed their firm support for all the unified financial and economic measures of the Central Government, and their willingness to work hard to improve production and overcome the current difficulties.

On the last day of the conference, Vice Minister of Textile Industry Qian Zhiguang gave a summary. He pointed out: The general policy of the national textile industry in 1950 is to restore and improve production on the existing basis, thoroughly transform old enterprises, implement the democratization of factory management and enterprise management, accumulate funds for the country, and develop steadily, according to the state's finances and raw material supply situation. Vice Minister Qian called on all cadres to rely on the masses of workers, promote the spirit of serving the people, earnestly guarantee the completion of the production plan, improve output and quality, practice thrift, overcome waste, reduce costs, and strengthen machine maintenance, factory safekeeping, and employee labor insurance. He said that the reforms decided at the meeting, such as reducing the starch content of yarn and cloth, unifying specifications, and simplifying trademarks, would save the country more than 60 million catties of millet. All localities should implement this spirit of saving in all factories in accordance with their specific circumstances. Vice Minister Qian emphasized that in order to complete the task, factories in all localities must vigorously implement the democratization of factory management, establish and improve factory management committees and employee representative conferences, change the various old systems and old styles left over from bureaucratic capitalism, strengthen the unity of the Party, administration, and trade union, strengthen the study of political theory and technical business, overcome backward conservative ideas, and give full play to the wisdom of the masses of workers to work together to improve production.
