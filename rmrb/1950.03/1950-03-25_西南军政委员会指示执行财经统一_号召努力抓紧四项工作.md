Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 23rd. The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee issued instructions on March 20th to its subordinates to resolutely implement the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on unifying national financial and economic work. The instructions stated that this decision fully conforms to the hopes of the people of the whole country. If the ten tasks in the decision are all accomplished, it will definitely be possible to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, stabilize prices, and on this basis, ensure support for the front lines, stabilize people's livelihoods, and develop industry, agriculture, and commerce. Therefore, all levels of government, the military, and the people in the entire Southwest must work hard to ensure its full implementation.

The instructions further pointed out that the key to completing the task lies first in verifying personnel numbers, practicing strict economy, reducing expenditures, and eliminating waste. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, it was decided to establish a branch of the Southwest Regional Establishment Committee, with Deng Xiaoping as the director and Li Da and Liu Daifeng as the deputy directors; and to establish a branch of the Southwest Regional Warehouse Inventory and Allocation Committee, with Chen Xiyun as the director and Yao Jiming and Liu Qing as the deputy directors. The Southwest Military Regions, provinces, administrative offices, and the two cities of Chongqing and Chengdu should also immediately establish the above two organizations at their respective levels and begin work.

The instructions pointed out: The second key to completing the task is to complete 100% of the 1949 annual grain collection plan and the tax revenue plans of various regions, and strive to exceed them. Based on the actual situation in the Southwest, it is entirely possible to complete the grain and tax revenue figures. The problem lies in overcoming the tendency of cadres to underestimate tax work, quickly adopting effective measures, strengthening tax organizations, training tax cadres, and transferring capable personnel to strengthen their leadership. In terms of public grain, in addition to collecting the full amount as required, it is particularly necessary to strengthen management and transportation work to avoid losses. It is also necessary to overcome the phenomenon in individual regions and among some cadres of emphasizing difficulties and lacking confidence in grain collection work. Those evil landlords who resist paying grain should be punished according to law.

The instructions believe that the third key to completing the task lies in resolutely implementing centralization and unification. Whether it is trade, finance, finance, or industry, they must all work in accordance with the system and plan set by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the specific tasks given by the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee. Any form of departmentalism or an attitude of perfunctoriness towards tasks must be opposed. Once tasks have been determined, lower levels can only think of every possible way to ensure their completion. Suggestions can be made to higher levels, but it is absolutely not allowed to modify them without authorization or go their own way. Those who violate the system, embezzle and waste resources, and fail to make efforts to complete tasks must be given appropriate punishments, even severe legal sanctions. Those who have made achievements in implementing the system and completing tasks should be rewarded.

The instructions stated that the fourth key to completing the task lies in stepping up the suppression of bandits and secret agents. This is a serious political responsibility of governments, the military, and the people at all levels. Efforts must be made to arrest and severely punish bandits and secret agents who sabotage state property. The instructions concluded by saying that the Southwest region has only been liberated recently, and there are some difficulties in following various financial tasks, but as long as our cadres at all levels recognize the seriousness of financial work and have an attitude of being responsible to the people, they will find ways to overcome all difficulties; and these difficulties can be overcome.

　　西南军政委员会指示执行财经统一
    号召努力抓紧四项工作
    【新华社重庆二十三日电】西南军政委员会三月二十日指示所属坚决执行中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定。指示称，这个决定完全符合于全国人民的希望，如果决定中的十项任务都做到了，就一定能够平衡财政收支，稳定物价，并能在这个基础上保障支援前线，安定人民生计和发展工农商业。因此全西南的各级政府、军队和人民必须为保证其全部实施而努力。
    指示继指出，完成任务的关键，首先在于核实人数、厉行节约、减少开支、消除浪费。因此，根据政务院指示，决定成立西南区编制委员会分会，以邓小平为主任，李达、刘岱峰为副主任；成立西南区仓库清理调配委员会分会，以陈希云为主任，姚继鸣、刘清为副主任。西南各军区、各省、行署及重庆、成都两市亦应立即按级建立上述两个组织，开始工作。
    指示指出：完成任务的第二个关键，在于百分之百地完成一九四九年度的公粮征收计划和各区的税收计划，并力求超过之。根据西南的实际情况，完成公粮、税收的数目是完全可能的。问题在于克服干部中的轻视税务工作的思想，迅速采取有效的办法，加强税收组织，训练税收干部，并征调得力人员加强其领导。公粮方面，除如数征齐外，尤须特别加强管理和调运工作，避免损耗。并须克服个别地区及某些干部在征粮工作中强调困难、缺乏信心的现象，对于抗不缴粮的恶霸地主，应予依法惩处。
    指示认为，完成任务的第三个关键，在于坚决实行集中统一，无论贸易、金融、财政、工业都必须按照中央人民政府政务院所定制度和计划及西南财经委员会所给予的具体任务进行工作，反对任何形式的本位主义或对任务的敷衍塞责的态度。各项任务既经确定，下级只有去想尽一切方法保证完成之。有意见可向上级提出建议，绝不允许擅自修改，各行其是。对于破坏制度、贪污浪费及不努力完成任务者，必须给以适当的处分，乃至严重的法律制裁。对于执行制度和完成任务有成绩者应予奖励。
    指示称，完成任务的第四个关键，在于加紧肃清土匪特务，这是各级政府军队和人民的严重的政治责任；对于破坏国家财产的土匪特务必须努力缉拿归案，严厉处办。指示最后称：西南地区解放不久，在遵行各项财政任务上是有若干困难的，但是只要我们各级干部认识到财经工作的严重性，具有对人民负责的态度，就会想办法克服一切困难；而这些困难都是能够克服的。
