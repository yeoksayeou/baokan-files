The First Group of Female Train Attendants in New China
    The Lushun-Dalian Railway Bureau has produced the first group of female train attendants (including three female drivers) in New China, a pioneering event in Chinese history. This has opened up a glorious path for women in New China.

    At 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the first "March 8th" International Women's Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the first train driven by female drivers departed victoriously from Dalian Station amidst the farewell of more than 2,000 women representatives from all walks of life. Before departure, a grand departure ceremony was held at Dalian Station. Leading comrades from the Luda Administrative Office and the District Party Committee were present to offer congratulations. The first train driven by Chinese women victoriously headed towards Lushun amidst the personal ribbon-cutting by Wu Yanan, Chairman of the Luda Women's Federation, and the waving and cheering of more than 2,000 women representatives.
