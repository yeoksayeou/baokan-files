　　Women Are No Longer "The Weaker Sex"
　　——On "White-Clad Warriors" for International Women's Day

　　"Frailty, thy name is woman!" – this line written by Shakespeare in his plays three or four hundred years ago no longer aligns with reality in today's socialist or New Democratic societies. After the shackles of feudalism and feudalistic ideology imposed on women, and the fetters of capitalism and bourgeois consciousness imposed on women under the guise of "women's liberation," are completely shattered, women become a "great force" (Stalin's words). Women are no longer slaves who "obey their fathers at home, their husbands after marriage, and their sons after the death of their husbands," nor are they "commodities" firmly bound by economics (and therefore by politics and society). As completely free, truly independent individuals on equal footing with men, women have been given full opportunities and guarantees to develop their talents, fighting heroically for the motherland, for the people, for lasting peace and people's democracy, and for the cause of human liberation. As we are familiar with: Zhé Jùyīng (Kǒng Jué: "The Story of a Woman's Emancipation"), Liú Húlán (collective creation by the Northwest Combat Drama Troupe: "Liú Húlán"), Wáng Xiùluán (Fù Duó: "Wáng Xiùluán"), Hú Xiùzhī (script by Yán Yīyān, directed by Líng Zǐfēng and Zhái Qiáng: "Daughters of China"), etc., are typical examples that emerged during the Anti-Japanese War led by the Chinese Communist Party; such as Solokova (Soviet film "Government Member"), Tanya (or Zoya, a Soviet film of the same name), Maritte (a Soviet film of the same name), Lyubov Shevtsova, Ulya Gromova (Fadeyev: "The Young Guard" and the film of the same name), etc., are figures nurtured by socialist Soviet Union. Whether they are ordinary people, Communist Party members, or Communist Youth League members, similarly, they are no longer "the weaker sex," but strong warriors.

　　Zhuāng Yì, appearing in the People's Liberation War as a battlefield medical team leader, sculpted in the film "White-Clad Warriors," is one such strong warrior. Through her, we see the "implementation of revolutionary humanitarianism" of the vast number of medical workers, and we once again see the spirit of women "actively and self-sacrificingly working… to achieve the complete liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people" (Constitution of the Communist Party of China: General Program).

　　Let's take a look at Zhuāng Yì. As the film reflects to us, these are indeed just ordinary events, perhaps seen as somewhat "thrilling" (these two words are not very appropriate) by people in the rear, but they are the daily routine in the front lines, in war. It is precisely countless people like Zhuāng Yì, like the assistant, like other nurses, like the cooks, who, although they never fired a gun at the enemy, work as hard as the soldiers, toiling under artillery fire, and with their respective labor, spirit, blood, and talent, serve the wounded and sick. If we don't say that Zhuāng Yì is one of the most outstanding workers among them, we should admit that she is a representative of the thousands of outstanding workers, and at the same time, a representative of the tens of thousands of women who have dedicated themselves to the revolutionary cause. It is she who has never known difficulty and has undertaken the tasks assigned to her by her superiors; it is she who cares for the wounded more than herself; it is she who is full of compassion, responsibility, and patience in serving the wounded; it is she who combines work and study to improve her skills; it is she who forgets danger and fatigue and performs surgery all night under bombing; it is she… Is it just her alone? No, she represents all the male and female medical workers whose names we do not know, representing women who will never be "the weaker sex" again.

　　Such women are nurtured by the education of the Chinese Communist Party, tempered by the ten years of land revolution, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and the three years of the Liberation War, and have become an excellent tradition. Participating in revolutionary work—receiving this education and training—is not just one Zhuāng Yì, but hundreds of thousands, millions of men and women. These men and women show special achievements in ordinary work, and the tools in their hands are guns, hammers, sickles, spinning wheels, chalk, scissors, tweezers, or something else, can similarly achieve this goal: to do their best for the revolutionary cause and make special contributions. In this sense, Zhuāng Yì is not only a model for medical workers, but also a model for women, and even a model for all those who participate in the revolution.

　　The revolution led by the proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party, has such power, or rather, the thoroughness of the revolution is manifested in such matters: women who were once considered "the weaker sex" become strong warriors, and ordinary people become people "made of special materials." Zhuāng Yì in "White-Clad Warriors" is a vivid example.

### 女人不再是“弱者”——三八节谈“白衣战士”

　　女人不再是“弱者”
    ——三八节谈“白衣战士”
    梅令宜
    “弱者，你的名字是女人。”——三、四百年前莎士比亚写在他的剧本中的这句话，在今天的社会主义社会或新民主主义社会里，已经不符合实际了。当封建制度与封建思想加在妇女身上的镣铐和资本主义制度与资产阶级意识在“妇女解放”这一金字招牌下加在妇女身上的枷锁彻底被粉碎了之后，妇女就成为一种“伟大的力量”（斯大林语）。妇女不再是“在家从父，出嫁从夫，夫死从子”的奴隶，也不再是被经济（从而是被政治、被社会）牢牢束缚住的“商品”。做为一个完全自由的、真正独立的、与男性处于平等地位的人，妇女得到了充分发展自己的才能的机会与保障，为祖国、为人民、为持久和平与人民民主、为人类解放事业而英勇的战斗着。如我们所熟知的：折聚英（孔厥：《一个女人翻身的故事》）、刘胡兰（西北战斗剧社集体创作：《刘胡兰》）、王秀鸾（傅铎：《王秀鸾》）、胡秀之（颜一烟编剧，凌子风、翟强导演：《中华女儿》）等等，是中国共产党领导的抗日战争期间所出现的典型；如索洛克娃（苏联电影《政府委员》、丹娘（或卓娅，同名的苏联电影）、玛丽特（同名的苏联电影）、柳波芙·西芙特梭娃、邬丽亚·戈洛摩娃（法捷耶夫：《青年近卫军》及同名电影）等等，是社会主义的苏联所培育的人物。无论她们是普普通通的人民，是共产党员，或是青年团员，同样的，不再是什么“弱者”，而是坚强的战士。
    出现于人民解放战争中的，以一个战地医疗队队长的身份，被雕塑于电影《白衣战士》中的庄毅，也就是这样的坚强的战士之一。通过她，我们看见了万千的医务工作者的“实行革命的人道主义”的精神，我们又一次的看见了妇女的“积极地自我牺牲地进行工作……达到中国民族与中国人民的彻底解放”（中国共产党党章：总纲）的精神。
    这里，就看看庄毅吧。如电影所反映给我们的，诚然，不过是一些平凡的事情，在后方的人们看来也许觉得有些“惊险”（这两个字并不很恰当），在前方、在战争中却是每日经常进行着的工作。恰恰是无数如庄毅、如协理员、如其他护士们、如炊事员的人们，虽然不曾拿枪射击敌人，却和战士一样的出死入生，在炮火下劳作，并且，以他们各自的劳力、精神、鲜血和才能，为伤病员服务。庄毅，如果我们不说她是其中一个最杰出的工作者，也应该承认是数以千计的杰出的工作者的一个代表，同时，也是数以万计的献身于革命事业的妇女的一个代表。是她，从来不知道困难的担承了上级分配给她的任务；是她，爱护伤员胜过自己；是她，充满了同情心、责任心与耐心的为伤员服务；是她，把工作与学习结合起来以提高自己的业务；是她，忘掉危险与疲倦的在轰炸下整夜的施行手术；是她……仅仅是她一个人吗？不，这样的她，正代表了所有的不为我们知道名字的男、女医务工作者，代表了永远不会再是“弱者”的妇女。
    这样的妇女是中国共产党的教育所培育出来的，是十年土地革命、八年抗日战争与三年解放战争所锻炼出来的，并且，成为一种优秀的传统了。参加革命工作——接受这种教育与锻炼的不只是一个庄毅，而是几十万、几百万的男女。这些男女，在平凡的工作中显出了特殊的功绩，手里的工具是枪、是铁锤、是镰刀、是纺车、是粉笔、是一把剪子和两把镊子、或是别的什么，同样的可以达到这个目的：为革命事业尽其全力并有特殊的贡献。在这一意义上说，庄毅不仅是医务工作者的模范，而且是妇女的模范，更是一切参加革命的人的模范。
    为无产阶级及其先锋队的共产党所领导的革命，就具有这样的力量，或者说，在这样的事情上表现了革命的彻底性：曾被认为是“弱者”的女人成为坚强的战士，平凡的人成为“由特殊材料制成的”人了。“白衣战士”中的庄毅，正是一个鲜明的例证。
