Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th. The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government held an evening party at the Beijing Hotel at 7:30 tonight to welcome Wang Jia, Bo Zhi, and Cai Liang, the Tibetan representatives from Xikang. More than 400 representatives from various agencies and schools, as well as Tibetans living in Beijing, attended the event. Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government, Secretary-General Lin Boqu of the Central People's Government, Vice Premier Dong Biwu of the Government Administration Council, and Deputy Director Peng Zemin of the Political and Legal Committee also attended. A huge banner written in both Chinese and Tibetan reading "Long Live the Great Unity of All Nationalities in China" was hung high in the venue. At the beginning of the evening party, Deputy Director Liu Geping delivered a speech, expressing a warm welcome to the three representatives for coming to Beijing from afar to pay their respects to the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army, and to express the Tibetan people's urgent desire for liberation. Deputy Director Liu pointed out that the arrival of the three representatives shows that the Tibetan people have realized that the Central People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army's policy of supporting minority nationalities is entirely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people. Deputy Director Liu especially pointed out that thanks to the wise leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao, the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the unity and support of all ethnic groups in the country, and the increased awareness of the Tibetan people, the time for the Tibetan people to be liberated and participate in the big family of mutual assistance and cooperation of all ethnic groups in the new China will not be far away. After Deputy Director Liu Geping's speech, the three Tibetan representatives presented flags to the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army, which were accepted by Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Secretary-General Lin. Representative Wang Jia also delivered a dedicatory speech, stating that the people of Xikang, together with all ethnic groups in the country, have been liberated under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the active assistance of the People's Liberation Army, and have become members of the big family of friendly cooperation of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China. However, the Tibetan people are still suffering from the aggression of British and American imperialism and the oppression of internal enemies of the people, living a life like beasts of burden. All Tibetan compatriots unanimously hope that the People's Liberation Army will advance into Tibet as soon as possible, so that Tibetan compatriots can be completely liberated, vowing to do everything possible in terms of manpower and material resources to actively support the People's Liberation Army, complete the task of liberating Tibet, and strive to consolidate the unity of all nationalities and build an independent, free, unified, and prosperous new China. Commander-in-Chief Zhu then delivered a reply, expressing gratitude for the respect and flag presentation by the three representatives. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have always regarded helping all minority nationalities to achieve complete liberation as a glorious task. The People's Liberation Army will surely overcome all difficulties, cooperate closely with Tibetan compatriots, and realize the liberation of Tibet. No foreign imperialist conspiracy can stop the realization of this determination. (Attached pictures)
