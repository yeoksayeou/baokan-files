　　Critique of Reader Service Sections in Newspapers Across Various Regions

After reading the variously named reader service sections ("Service Section," "Social Service," etc.) of major public newspapers in various cities in February, we feel that our public newspapers' work in connecting with readers is quite insufficient. First, the space specifically provided to readers by newspapers is too small. For newspapers publishing over one broadsheet page daily, only seven papers, including Shanghai's *Liberation Daily*, Nanjing's *Xinhua Daily*, *Zhejiang Daily*, *Changjiang Daily*, *Southern Daily*, *Henan Daily*, and *New Hunan Daily*, allocate an average of five to six thousand characters per issue for the reader service section. *Chengdu's Western Sichuan Daily* and *Chongqing's Xinhua Daily* often only allocate less than two thousand characters, while Beijing's *People's Daily* had no reader service section at all in February. In terms of the frequency of reader service sections, in the month of February, *Chahar Daily* (nine times), *Pingyuan Daily* (eight times), *Shanxi Daily* (nine times), *Su Bei Daily* (nine times), *Jinan's Dazhong Daily* (six times), and *Xi'an's Masses Daily* (nine times) published the section less than ten times. For newspapers that regularly have a reader service section, the content is often dominated by articles from the editorial department introducing various knowledge. These knowledge articles are mostly aimed at urban residents, cadres, and intellectuals, with very few targeting workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many newspapers prefer to use a considerable portion of their limited space to publish "brief replies," "mail forwarding," etc., which only concern individual readers, instead of using telephone, postal, or other methods to solve problems, thus leaving the space for topics of greater significance to readers.

In general, public newspapers adopt a cautious and responsible attitude when answering readers' questions, forwarding more important questions to relevant authorities for study and answers, which basically ensures the accuracy of the content. However, some newspaper editors still demonstrate a careless and irresponsible attitude in their work. For example, on February 11th, *Southern Daily*, in its "brief replies," answered a question about the registration of former Kuomintang naval personnel by simply publishing the reply obtained from the Jiangfang Command, stating, "Regarding the registration of former Kuomintang naval personnel, there is currently no such process in Guangzhou." However, right below this "brief reply," in the advertising column, was a notice from the Political Department of the Guangdong Military Region regarding the registration of former Kuomintang naval personnel, and the same notice had already been published on the third page of the same newspaper the day before. A reader's letter published in the newspaper on the 15th also severely criticized two other replies as "arbitrary evasions," "irrelevant," and inconsistent with the facts, indicating that this phenomenon has occurred more than once in the social service section of *Southern Daily*.

Many newspapers' reader service sections have conducted practical and effective discussions in conjunction with the current central tasks or central issues of their localities. For example, *Henan Daily*, in conjunction with the central task of land reform beginning in Henan, organized six land reform discussions (based on newspapers received up to the 26th) and continuously published many contributions from various locations. *Southern Anhui Daily* and *Northern Anhui Daily*, in conjunction with the central task of local production, disaster relief, and dike and flood prevention, organized a large number of contributions in this area. Because the content was closely integrated with these practical tasks, a large number of practical methods for surviving famine and methods for collecting and making substitute foods from the masses were published, exchanging practical experiences in production and disaster relief work. Based on an incident, *New Hunan Daily* organized discussions and criticisms and suggestions on improving military-civilian relations, publishing 28 articles, which was significant for strengthening the understanding of the masses in the new areas and the work of supporting the army during the Spring Festival. Some newspapers, on the other hand, appear passive in this regard, publishing whatever readers send in and answering whatever questions are raised. The reason why the reader service sections of these newspapers lack a clear basic service target, appearing to be all-encompassing but actually disorganized, is precisely because they lack initiative.

Publishing letters from readers (mainly working people), publishing their critical letters, is an effective means of raising readers' political enthusiasm and strengthening the mass work of newspapers. According to the results of our investigation, our newspapers pay attention to this aspect, but not sufficiently. We divided the articles published in the reader service sections of 35 public newspapers at the provincial and municipal levels into two major categories: service-oriented and criticism and suggestion-oriented. We found that criticism and suggestion-oriented articles are usually below 50%, and more than half of the newspapers are below 20%. What are the targets of criticism, suggestions, and denunciations in these critical letters? The survey results prove that many newspapers dare to publish the criticisms and suggestions of the working people to the government and working cadres. For example, in the nearly 50 critical letters published by *Northern Anhui Daily* in February, those criticizing county and district governments and cadres at all levels or making suggestions to them accounted for 70%. Readers pointed out extravagance and waste or significant corruption by a certain county or district government during the disaster relief period, reported that the tobacco seedlings in a certain area of a certain county had not been completely eradicated, etc., which helped the leading organs grasp the situation, inspect the work, and correct errors and deviations in a timely manner. On the other hand, some newspapers have not yet let the masses criticize the government and make suggestions to the government. For example, of the more than 20 critical letters published by *Shanghai's Liberation Daily* in February, only one letter suggested that cadres should not wear People's Liberation Army insignia randomly. The rest were mostly addressed to citizens or industrial and commercial sectors. This makes it impossible to give play to the political enthusiasm of the masses, and gives the reader service section the feeling of "reporting good news but not bad news."

Will letting the masses freely make criticisms and suggestions to the government, and even denounce certain cadres' illegal acts, provide an opportunity for bad people to exploit? There is no doubt that bad people are fully capable of using this opportunity to attack the government and cadres in order to achieve their destructive goals. However, our editors should never be apprehensive because of this, but should establish their own effective investigation work. Facts have proved that truly adopting a serious and responsible attitude towards the critical opinions of the masses will definitely be able to crack down on the destructive behavior of bad people taking advantage of loopholes. *Northern Anhui Daily*'s social service section published an article by the editor on February 13, stating that the newspaper received a letter in mid-December of last year from Yanghe Township, Qianqiao District, Tonglu County, signed Yin Derong and Yang Anquan, criticizing the township head Zhang Yuewu for saying: "Guaranteeing the masses to snatch and cut firewood and trees on the People's Mountain, causing people in the mountainous area to be unable to live in peace." However, after the newspaper forwarded it to the local district government for investigation, and reporters near the area helped to understand the situation, it was not only discovered that the letter was falsely accusing the cadres under other people's names, but also proved that the person who falsely accused was a heinous evil tyrant. The county government detained him on January 3 and will hand him over to the people for public trial. It can be seen that as long as a serious and responsible attitude is adopted and readers' letters are handled carefully, it is possible to prevent bad people from taking advantage of loopholes. It is completely wrong to not use the reader service section to launch mass criticism and self-criticism in order to avoid giving bad people an opportunity to exploit.

The reader service section is the main garden for contacting the masses in our newspapers. This section must gradually give the main position to the readers' criticisms and suggestions, reports on the situation, provision of newspaper materials, and letters for discussing issues, instead of being mostly filled with articles from the editorial department. This is a very important key to improving the prestige of newspapers and the political enthusiasm of the masses, and to improving the work of our government agencies.

　　评各地报纸的读者服务版
    读了二月份各重要城市公营报纸的名目不同的读者服务版（“服务版”、“社会服务”等），我们感觉我们的公营报纸和读者的联系工作是作得很不够的。首先是，报纸特别提供给读者的篇幅太少。每天出版对开一张以上的报纸，读者服务版的每期平均占五六千字的只有上海解放日报、南京新华日报、浙江日报、长江日报、南方日报、河南日报、新湖南报等七家，经常只占两千字以下的有成都川西日报、重庆新华日报，而北京人民日报在二月份竟完全没有读者服务版的篇幅。按各报读者服务版的出现次数来说，在二月份一个月中，见报不到十次的有察哈尔日报（九次）、平原日报（八次）、山西日报（九次）、苏北日报（九次）、济南大众日报（六次）、西安群众日报（九次）。经常有读者服务版的各报，读者服务版的篇幅也往往以编辑部介绍各种知识的稿子为主。这些介绍知识的稿件，又大多数是以市民、干部与知识分子为对象，而很少是以工农兵为对象的。有许多报纸宁愿在有限的篇幅中用相当大的地位登载仅仅有关个别读者的“简复”、“代邮”等等，却并不利用电话、邮政及其他方法去解决问题，把篇幅让给对读者有更大意义的题材。
    公营报纸在解答读者问题时，一般说，是采取了慎重负责态度的，较重要的问题都转送有关机关研究解答，基本上保证了内容的正确性。但个别报纸的编辑在工作上仍表现粗枝大叶的不负责任的态度。如二月十一日南方日报在“简复”中回答国民党海军人员登记问题，就只是把向江防司令部查询所得的复函照刊，说“关于伪国民党海军人员登记事，目前广州尚无”。但是恰好在这一则“简复”下面的广告栏就登载着广东军区司令部政治部关于登记原国民党海军人员的通告，而同一通告在前一天该报第三页就已经登载过了。十五日该报刊出的一封读者来信也严重地批评了另外两件“任意搪塞”、“牛头不对马嘴”和与事实不符的答复，足见这种现象之出现在南方日报社会服务版上是非止一次的。
    有不少报纸读者服务版结合当地当前中心工作或中心问题，进行了实际有效的讨论。如河南日报结合河南开始进行土地改革的中心工作组织了六期土改讨论（收到报纸至二十六日止），并连续刊登了许多来自各地的稿件。皖南日报皖北日报结合当地生产救灾修堤防水的中心工作，大量地组织了这一方面的稿件。由于内容与这些实际工作密切结合，也就有了大批从群众中来的实际渡荒办法与代食品采制办法等刊出，交流了生产救灾工作中的实际经验。新湖南报根据一个事件，组织了增进军民关系的讨论和批评建议，刊载稿件二十八篇，这对于加强新区群众认识与春节拥军工作是有意义的。有些报纸则在这一方面表现被动，读者来什么就登什么，提什么问题就答什么问题。这些报纸的读者服务版之所以表现出缺乏明确的基本服务对象，看来好像是兼容并包，而实际上杂乱无章，正是由于他们缺乏主动性的结果。
    在读者服务版上刊载读者（主要是劳动人民）的来信，发表他们的批评信件，是提高读者政治积极性和加强报纸群众工作的有效手段。根据我们调查的结果，我们的报纸对这一方面是注意的，但是不够充分。我们把省市级以上三十五种公营报纸读者服务版所刊载的稿件分作服务性的与批评建议性的两大类加以统计，我们发现批评建议性稿件通常在百分之五十以下，而且有半数以上报纸是在百分之二十以下的。在这种批评性的信件中，批评、建议、检举的对象是什么呢？调查结果证明，有不少报纸是敢于发表劳动人民对政府和工作干部的批评建议的。如皖北日报，在二月份所发表的近五十封批评信件中，批评县区政府和各级干部或向他们提出建议的占百分之七十。读者指出了某一县或区政府在救灾期中铺张浪费或重大贪污现象，检举了某一县什么地方烟苗没有铲尽等等，这就帮助了领导机关掌握情况，检查工作，及时纠正错误和偏向。但在另一方面，也有一些报纸还没有放手让群众批评政府，向政府提出建议。如上海解放日报，在二月份发表的二十多封批评信件中，只有一封信是建议干部不要乱戴人民解放军军徽胸章的。其余多是向市民或工商业提出的。这样就不可能发挥群众的政治积极性，而使读者服务版给人以“报喜不报忧”的感觉。
    放手让群众对政府提出批评建议，甚至检举若干干部的违法行为等，是不是可能给坏人以钻空子的机会呢？毫无疑问，坏人是完全可能利用这个机会打击政府和干部，以达到其破坏目的的。但是，我们的编辑人员决不应因此就心存顾忌，而应该建立自己的有效的调查工作。事实证明，真正对群众的批评意见采取严肃负责的态度，就一定可以打击坏人钻空子的破坏行为。皖北日报社会服务版二月十三日刊出了编者的一篇稿件，说明该报于去年十二月中旬接到桐庐县钱桥区杨和乡一封署名尹德荣、杨安全的来信，批评该乡乡长张越舞说：“保障群众抢伐人民山上的柴和树，致使山区一带的人民不能安居”。但经该报转交当地区政府调查，并由在该地附近的记者前往帮助了解情况以后，不仅发觉来信是假借他人名义栽诬干部的，而且证明假借名义者本人就是罪恶滔天的大恶霸，县政府已于一月三日予以扣押，将交人民公审。由此可见，只要采取严肃负责的态度，慎重地处理读者的来信，就可以防止坏人钻空子。为了避免给坏人以钻空子的机会而不使用读者服务版展开群众的批评与自我批评，是完全错误的。
    读者服务版在我们的报纸上是联系群众的主要园地。这一版一定要逐步使读者的批评建议、报告情况、提供报纸材料和讨论问题的来信占主要地位，而不应该大部分为编辑部的稿件所充塞。这对于提高报纸威信与群众的政治积极性，改进我们的政府机关工作，是一个十分重要的关键。
