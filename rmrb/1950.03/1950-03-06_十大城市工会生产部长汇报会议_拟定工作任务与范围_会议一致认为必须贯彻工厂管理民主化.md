Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th. The report meeting of production ministers from ten city trade unions, convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was held from February 21st to March 3rd. After three days of reporting and eight days of discussion, the meeting initially drafted the following four proposals: (1) Tasks and scope of work for the production departments of regional and industrial trade unions; (2) Organization and work of factory and workshop production committees; (3) Labor agreements; (4) Implementation measures for apprenticeship contracts in state-owned and public enterprises. The meeting also extensively exchanged views on how to transform old enterprises and improve production in private enterprises.

On the eighth day of the meeting (February 28th), Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended and delivered a speech. He pointed out that production work is the central task of trade unions. Transforming old bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into new democratic enterprises is the primary condition for improving and developing production. Implementing democratic factory management and unifying various systems are the central links in transforming old enterprises. Because Northeast China was liberated earlier, old enterprises have been basically transformed, so the current task of trade union production work is how to further elevate the New Record Movement, establish collective contracts by industry, move from a bonus wage system for exceeding quotas to a comprehensive piece-rate wage system, and on this basis, organize and launch a comprehensive production competition movement. The inland areas were liberated later, and although old enterprise structures have undergone some partial adjustments, they are basically still old structures and systems without major changes. The current central task is to transform old enterprises in a planned and gradual manner. At the same time, production competitions should be organized and rationalization proposals should be launched at the factory level based on the specific circumstances of the enterprise, laying the foundation for a comprehensive production movement. Trade unions must also pay attention to production work in private enterprises, because production development is the greatest benefit for the working class. He also pointed out that the focus of local trade union production work should be on grassroots factory organizations, and production departments must strengthen their leadership over grassroots organizations.

During the meeting, the participants conducted self-criticism based on the February 6th People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," combined with their own work. Regarding the issue of democratic factory management, it was unanimously agreed that: trade union cadres have failed to proactively and actively promote this work, have not actively put forward opinions to the administrative side, or have carried out democratic management in isolation, without close integration with production. This is one of the important reasons why most factory management committees are merely formalities. Furthermore, the lack of democratic style on the part of some factory administrations has also hindered the mobilization of the masses' production enthusiasm. Doing a good job in production is the common task of trade unions and administrations, and only by implementing democratic factory management can we fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and staff, enabling production to recover and develop rapidly.

　　十大城市工会生产部长汇报会议
    拟定工作任务与范围
    会议一致认为必须贯彻工厂管理民主化
    【新华社北京五日电】中华全国总工会召开的十大城市工会生产部长汇报会议于上月二十一日至三月三日举行。经过三天汇报和八天的讨论，会议初步拟出了以下四个草案：（一）各地区、各产业总工会生产部的任务与工作范围；（二）工厂与车间生产委员会的组织与工作；（三）劳动公约；（四）国营、公营企业师徒合同实施办法。会议并就如何改造旧企业、私营企业中改进生产等问题广泛交换了意见。
    会议第八日（二月二十八日），全国总工会副主席李立三出席讲话，他指出，生产工作是工会的中心工作。把旧的官僚资本主义企业改造为新民主主义的新企业是改进生产、发展生产的主要条件。而实行工厂管理民主化、统一各种制度，是改造旧企业的中心环节。东北因解放较早，旧企业基本上经过改造，所以工会生产工作的当前任务是如何将新纪录运动提高一步，按产业订立集体合同，由超额奖励工资制走向全面计件工资制，并在此基础上组织与发动全面性的生产竞赛运动。关内地区解放较晚，旧企业机构虽有某些局部调整，但基本上仍是旧的机构、制度，没有大的改变，当前中心工作是有计划地、逐步地改造旧企业问题。同时应根据企业具体情况，以工厂为单位，组织生产竞赛，开展合理化建议，为全面生产运动打下基础。工会也必须注意私营企业中的生产工作，因为生产发展是工人阶级最大的利益。他并指出地方工会生产工作应以工厂基层组织为重心，生产部必须加强对基层组织的领导。
    会议中，曾根据二月六日人民日报社论《学会管理企业》，结合自己的工作，进行检讨。关于工厂管理民主化的问题，一致认为：工会干部未能主动地积极地推动此一工作，没有向行政方面积极提出意见，或孤立地搞管理民主化，没有与生产密切结合，这是大部分工厂管理委员会流于形式的重要原因之一。而某些工厂行政方面缺乏民主作风，也阻碍了群众生产积极性的发挥。搞好生产是工会行政的共同任务，而贯彻工厂管理民主化，才能充分发挥职工的积极性与创造性，使生产迅速恢复与发展。
