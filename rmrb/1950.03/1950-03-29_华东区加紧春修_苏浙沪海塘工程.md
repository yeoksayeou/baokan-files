Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th: East China is stepping up its spring repair work on the seawalls of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. Most of the wooden piles and stones needed by the counties along the seawall in Southern Jiangsu have been transported to the construction sites; the Changshu section has completed 71% to 86% of the entire rock dumping and pile driving project. The material transportation and dredging projects of the Suidang River and Luodian River in Baoshan have also been completed; the dredging projects of the Suidang River in Songjiang and Taicang, Southern Jiangsu, have also been mostly completed. Of the twenty projects in Zhejiang, nine have started one after another, and generally 15% to 30% of the projects have been completed. The remaining eleven sections will also start construction at the end of the month and early April. Shanghai completed the first phase of the Baotai Beach closure project in January. However, due to the incomplete dredging of the Suidang River in Southern Jiangsu, the material transportation has not been completely resolved; Zhejiang has not carried out material transportation due to the lack of ships; Shanghai's second phase of project funds has not been allocated, and it has not been able to start construction. In addition, seasonal rain and the busy farming season have arrived, and there are still many difficulties in completing the overall project before the summer flood in June. In order to exchange experiences from various places, overcome difficulties, and ensure the complete completion of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai seawall projects before the summer flood, the East China Military and Political Committee's Water Conservancy Department specially convened a Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai seawall meeting from March 20th to 23rd. At the meeting, Liu Chongguang, Deputy Minister of the Water Conservancy Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, gave instructions on engineering standards, equipment procurement, planning and funding, project acceptance, organizational leadership, and seawall maintenance in his speech. The meeting also decided to establish a "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Seawall Technology Research Group" in order to improve seawall engineering technology.

　　华东区加紧春修
    苏浙沪海塘工程
    【新华社上海二十六日电】华东区正加紧进行苏浙沪海塘春修工程。苏南沿塘各县所需木桩、石块已大部运抵施工地段；常熟工段并已完成抛石、打桩全部工程的百分之七十一至八十六。宝山运料和疏浚随塘河、罗店河工程亦已完成；苏南松江、太仓随塘河疏浚工程亦已大部完工；浙江二十处工程先后开工的已有九处，一般已完成工程百分之十五至三十，其余十一个工段亦将于月底及四月初动工；上海则已于一月份完成第一期炮台滨堵口工程。但由于苏南随塘河疏浚尚未完工，运料尚未完全解决；浙江因船只缺少，运料亦未进行；上海第二期工程经费尚未拨下，亦未能开始动工，加之季节性的阴雨和农忙已到，在六月夏汛前，完成全面工程尚有不少困难。华东军政委员会水利部为交流各地经验，克服困难，保证夏汛前苏浙沪海塘工程的全部完成，于三月二十日至二十三日特召开苏浙沪海塘会议。会上，华东军政委员会水利部副部长刘宠光在发言中就工程标准、器材运购、计划与经费、工程验收、组织领导、海塘养护等方面作了指示。会议并决定成立“苏浙沪海塘技术研究组”，以期提高海塘工程技术。
