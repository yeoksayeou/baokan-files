　　Ample Raw Materials, Low Costs
    Private Factories Relocated to Zhengzhou Increase Production and Sales
    [Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou] Reporter Chen Ji reports: More than ten private factories have relocated to Zhengzhou City from Shanghai, Jiangsu, and other places. With the help of the People's Government and the support of the broad masses of workers, some of the relocated factories have successively started production. The production volume of these factories has increased compared to before, and sales are also quite brisk. Since the second half of last year, the private factories that have relocated to Zhengzhou City include: Shanghai Xinhe Yarn Factory, Wuxi Xinyi Yarn Factory, Taicang Yuxin Yarn Factory, Shanghai Limin Yarn Factory, Shanghai Huafei Cigarette Factory, Shanghai Xinhua Cigarette Factory, Shanghai Jishi Cigarette Factory, Shanghai Dayunlong Cigarette Factory, Shanghai China Match Company, Shanghai Wenyi Typecasting Company, etc. Among them, the four yarn factories have a total of 13,160 spindles. The cotton produced in Henan Province can supply 100,000 spindles. There is absolutely no problem with the supply of raw cotton.
    Among the more than ten private factories that have relocated, the Xinyi Yarn Factory and the Huafei Cigarette Factory have both officially started production. After the Xinyi Yarn Factory started production in November last year, its production volume in January reached 5,580 small bundles of cotton yarn; the monthly output is not enough to meet market demand. The factory's main raw materials come from Luoyang, Nanyang, Chenggao, Shanxian, and other places. The transportation between these areas and Zhengzhou is extremely convenient, so the price of raw cotton is low. At the same time, the quality of these raw cottons is also good. The factory manager said: "All this is too good for us, we are working hard to reduce costs to facilitate production." The Huafei Cigarette Factory started production on January 26 this year, producing 15 large boxes of cigarettes per day. The "Qianjin (Forward) Brand" cigarettes produced by the factory are currently one of the best-selling cigarettes in the Zhengzhou cigarette market. The tobacco leaves and other raw materials used by the factory all come from Xuchang. The quality of Xuchang tobacco leaves is good, the price is low, and the freight to Zhengzhou is also very cheap, which is a great advantage for the Huafei Cigarette Factory. The factory manager told reporters: "We thank the government for its help in finding us houses, hiring workers, and providing us with loans. Now we want to build and expand our factory buildings in order to develop further."
    Currently, Zhengzhou City is trying to increase electricity supply to meet the power needs of the relocated factories. At present, the lack of housing in Zhengzhou City is one of the difficulties for a large number of relocated factories. According to a comrade from the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau: "If the relocated factories want to build new factory buildings here, we are very welcome, we will definitely give the greatest help, and there is no problem with the land in Zhengzhou City."

　　原料足·成本低
    内迁郑州私营工厂产量提高销路旺盛
    【本报郑州特讯】记者陈迹报道：从上海、江苏等地内迁至郑州市的私营工厂已达十余家。部分内迁工厂在人民政府的帮助和广大职工的支持之下，已先后开工。这些已开工的工厂生产量较前增多，销路亦颇旺盛。从去年下半年起，先后迁来郑州市的私营工厂计有：上海信和纱厂、无锡新毅纱厂、太仓豫新纱厂、上海利民纱厂、上海华菲烟厂、上海新华烟厂、上海吉士烟厂、上海大运隆烟厂、上海中国火柴公司、上海文谊铸字公司等。其中四个纱厂共有一万三千一百六十枚纱锭。河南所产之棉花可供十万纱锭之用。原棉供应决无问题。
    在内迁的十余家私营工厂中，新毅纱厂和华菲烟厂均已正式开工。新毅纱厂于去年十一月开工后，元月份生产量已达五千五百八十小捆棉纱；每月所产成品，不够市场需要。该厂主要原料来自洛阳、南阳、成皋、陕县等地，这些地区和郑州间的交通极为便利，因此原棉价格低廉。同时这些原棉质量亦佳。该厂经理说：“这一切对我们太好了，我们正努力降低成本，以利生产。”华菲烟厂于今年一月二十六日开工，每日产纸烟十五大箱。该厂现在所产之“前进牌”香烟如郑州香烟市场中最畅销的一种。该厂所用烟叶等原料，都出自许昌。许昌烟叶质量好，价格低，运至郑州的运费也很便宜，这对于华菲烟厂是一个极大的有利条件。该厂经理对记者说：“我们感谢政府的帮助，给我们找房子，雇工人，还贷款给我们。现在我们要修建和扩大厂房，以便进一步地发展。”
    目前，郑州市正在设法增加电力，以便满足内迁工厂的动力需要。目前郑州市房屋缺乏，是大量内迁工厂的困难之一。据郑州市人民政府工商局某同志说：“如果内迁的工厂要在我们这里新建厂房，我们很欢迎，我们一定给以最大帮助，并且郑州市的地皮没有问题。”
