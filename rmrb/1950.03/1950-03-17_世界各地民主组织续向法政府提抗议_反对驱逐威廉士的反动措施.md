Xinhua News Agency, 16th - Democratic organizations around the world continue to protest the French government's unreasonable decision to expel Williams, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. According to TASS: The Soviet Anti-Fascist Youth Committee has issued a statement denouncing the French government's decision, aimed at obstructing the normal activities of the leading body of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which represents 60 million young people; and resolutely demanding that the French government revoke this anti-democratic decision and ensure that the leading body of the World Federation of Democratic Youth is no longer subjected to similar restrictions in the future.
    The Czechoslovak Youth League sent a telegram to the French government, demanding the cancellation of the order to expel Williams in order to quell the anger of the world's youth.
    According to the Telepress Agency: Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, also wrote to the French Minister of the Interior, Moke, to protest. Léripe, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor and Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, also issued a statement saying: "The expulsion order against Williams has aroused the anger of French workers. This measure is part of the French government's entire reactionary policy."
    The Peace Congress recently held in Oslo, Norway, protested to the French government through the French Embassy in Norway, stating that the French government, through its expulsion of Williams, has admitted that it is in collusion with the instigators of a new war.
    According to Pyongyang news: The North Korean Democratic Youth League and the South Korean Democratic Patriotic Youth League also sent telegrams to the French government to protest, pointing out that this illegal measure by the French government exposed its reactionary policy of fearing the rising international peace movement and attempting to instigate a new war.

    反对驱逐威廉士的反动措施
    【新华社十六日讯】世界各地民主组织继续抗议法国政府决定驱逐世界民主青年联盟书记威廉士的无理举动。据塔斯社消息：苏联青年反法西斯委员会已发表声明，指斥法国政府的决定旨在阻挠代表着六千万青年的世界民主青年联盟领导机构的正常活动；并坚决要求法国政府撤销这种反民主的决定，保证世界民主青年联盟的领导机构，今后不再受到类似的限制。
    捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟致电法国政府，要求撤消驱逐威廉士的命令，以平息世界青年的愤怒。
    据电通社讯：世界民主妇联主席戈登夫人亦曾写信给法国内政部长莫克，提出抗议。法国总工会总书记、世界工联副主席勒里普并发表声明称：“对威廉士的驱逐令，激起了法国工人的愤怒。这个手段是法国政府整个反动政策的一部分。”
    挪威奥斯陆最近召开的和平大会特经由法国驻挪大使馆向法国政府提出抗议称：法国政府由于其驱逐威廉士一举，承认了它和新战争挑拨者沆瀣一气。
    另据平壤消息：北朝鲜民主青年同盟与南朝鲜民主爱国青年同盟亦曾致电法国政府，提出抗议，其中指出：法国政府这一非法措施，暴露了它畏惧国际和平运动高涨并妄图挑拨新战争的反动政策。
