Air Defense Inquiry Station Unnecessary
Reply from the Telecommunications Bureau to Zhang Zhaohe's Suggestion
To the Editor:
　　Having read Comrade Zhang Zhaohe's letter "Raise Vigilance, Strengthen Air Defense Work" in the readers' letters section of your newspaper's sixth page on March 16th, specifically the second suggestion that "the Telecommunications Bureau should establish an air defense inquiry station for citizens to inquire," this bureau has studied it and believes that:
　　1. Specialized agencies are responsible for communicating air defense situations and directing air defense matters. The general public should listen to the signals they release and follow their directions to take cover. There is actually no need for inquiries.
　　2. The Telecommunications Bureau is only a communication agency and cannot grasp information related to air defense, so it cannot undertake such inquiry work.
　　Based on the above reasons, we believe that there is no need for the Telecommunications Bureau to establish such an inquiry station.
　　Sincerely,
　　Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, March 16th

### 防空询问台无设立必要  电信局答张朝和建议

专栏：

　　防空询问台无设立必要
    电信局答张朝和建议编辑同志：
    阅三月十六日贵报第六版读者来信中，有张朝和同志“提高警惕，加强防空工作”一函。其第二条建议“电信局应设防空询问台，以便市民询问”，当经本局加以研究，认为：
    一、传达防空情况，指挥防空事宜，均有专门负责机构，一般市民均应听从他们发布的信号及指挥躲避，事实上无询问之必要。
    二、电信局只是一个交通通讯机构，不能掌握有关防空的情况，故亦不能担当此等答询工作。
    根据以上的原因，我们认为电信局无设立此项询问台的必要。	  此致敬礼
    北京电信局启三月十六日
