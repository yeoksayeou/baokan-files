　　People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Symposium
    Celebrating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and Praising Its Great Achievements for Peace
    [Beijing News] The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs held a symposium at 7 p.m. on the 27th to celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Members Hu Yuzhi, Shi Liang, Lei Jieqiong, Weng Dujian, Fei Qing, Zeng Bingjun, Wang Kunlun, Zhang Hanfu, Lian Guan, Liu Wang Liming, Zhang Jiongbo, Tang Yueliang, Huang Qixiang, Ye Jingshen, Qiao Guanhua, Ke Bonian, Fan Hong, Dong Yueqian, Wang Tieya, Huan Xiang, Yang Gang, Gong Peng, and others, over ninety people in total, attended. Zhang Xiruo, the president of the institute, first delivered an opening speech, pointing out that amidst the celebration of the Sino-Soviet treaty, the institute should undertake the task of research and publicity. Following this, member Li Lisan gave a report in which he elaborated in detail on the epoch-making significance of the Sino-Soviet treaty, emphasizing that it is wrong to regard the Sino-Soviet treaty merely as a victory for Chinese diplomacy; the victory of the Sino-Soviet treaty is a victory for the Chinese people, a victory for the Soviet people, and also a victory for the world's peaceful and democratic camp. The Sino-Soviet treaty is a great force for consolidating world peace. Subsequently, Qian Duansheng, Shao Lizi, Tao Menghe, Luo Longji, He Sijing, Mei Ru'ao, and Liu Zerong spoke in succession, unanimously praising the great achievements of the Sino-Soviet treaty for world peace and human happiness, and expressing the most profound respect to Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong. Finally, Wu Maosun, the secretary-general of the institute, gave a brief report on the institute's affairs, and the meeting concluded in a joyful and enthusiastic atmosphere.
