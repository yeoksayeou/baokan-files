Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th: Hangzhou News: The Chen Wengang concrete stone slope embankment project on the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province, which took ten months, was completed on February 5th. The embankment is 1,604.1 meters long and is located in the most dangerous area of the seawall on the north bank of the Qiantang River. The safety of this embankment is extremely important to the lives and property of the people in more than ten counties including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, even when the embankment collapsed and caused disasters, it was never thoroughly repaired. Since Zhejiang was liberated last May, the provincial people's government has started this project, raising materials, mobilizing the masses, and sending a large number of cadres to actively carry out the repairs. The entire project used a total of 300,000 workers and approximately 100,000 tons of materials. Under the leadership of the provincial people's government, all construction workers and technicians worked hard to overcome the difficulties caused by four consecutive collapses of earthwork, and finally completed this large-scale construction project.

　　钱塘江陈文港竣工
    杭州等十余县可免水患
    【新华社上海二十日电】杭州讯：浙江省钱塘江的陈文港混凝土石块斜坡塘工程，历时十个月，已于二月五日完成。该塘全长一、六○四·一公尺，位于钱塘江北岸海塘最险要地区，该塘的安危，关系着杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）等十余县人民生命财产极大。但在国民党反动统治时期，虽该塘崩毁成灾，也从不彻底整修。自去年五月浙江解放后，该省人民政府即着手这一工程，筹措材料，动员群众，并派出大批干部，积极进行整修。全部工程共使用人力三十万工，材料约十万吨。在该省人民政府的领导下，全体修建工人、技术人员努力克服了接连四次土方坍毁所造成的困难，终于完成了这大规模的修建工程。
