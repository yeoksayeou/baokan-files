　　(I) Hope Tong County Area Pays Attention to Protecting Livestock

　　After the Spring Festival, on the main road south of Tong County, several farmers were pushing a large cart, complete with shafts, with a horse tied behind it. I was very surprised at the time, so I struck up a conversation to ask what was happening. It turned out like this: They lived in a certain village in the south and were invited to a meeting in a village in the north. This horse was originally a product of struggle, and after the land reform, it was shared among several poor peasant families. When it was time to use it, the families would compete, each afraid of losing out, but none of them were willing to feed it properly. As a result, the horse was starved. So today, after being harnessed to the cart and only traveling a few miles, it could no longer pull it, and they had no choice but to push the cart themselves.

　　This kind of disregard for livestock is a serious problem in several newly reformed areas nearby. Last autumn, when Tong County had not yet implemented land reform, the leading organs, in order to take care of poor peasants lacking animal power, had landlords and rich peasants allocate livestock for the poor peasants to use. As a result, quite a few livestock died from exhaustion and starvation. Taking the situation in the seventh district of Tong County as an example, there is an average of less than one head of livestock for every hundred mu of land. With such a lack of animal power, if the existing livestock is not properly protected, this year's agricultural production will definitely be greatly affected.

　　The reasons for this phenomenon are: First, the peasants' awareness is not enough, and they only see the immediate petty advantages without seeing the long-term benefits. They think the livestock came for free (?), and no one paid for it when it died (Editor's note: This is not the essence of the problem; the fundamental problem is that the local government did not fully mobilize the peasants to promptly shift land reform to production and try every means to protect the benefits already gained by the peasants.); Second, the leadership has not paid adequate attention to jointly raised livestock and has not properly organized the households that jointly raise them. It is hoped that the responsible cadres will quickly educate the peasants, pointing out the long-term benefits, and explaining that the fruits of struggle are also earned with the peasants' blood and sweat. At the same time, the households jointly raising livestock should be scientifically organized as much as possible to prevent the situation of "you lose out and I gain an advantage" from occurring.

　　Liu Dianjie, March 9th

　　Editor's note: Please Tong County party and government pay attention to Mr. Liu Dianjie's suggestion. If this serious phenomenon of harming livestock is ignored and allowed to continue, it may cause serious losses to agricultural production in the future. It is hoped that the responsible cadres of the local party and people's government will quickly investigate and take effective measures to stop it; finally, the results should be published in the newspaper.

　　(II) Resolutely Eliminate the Bad Custom of Infanticide

　　Since we came to Bengbu on official business for over a month, we have found two newborn baby girls abandoned on the roadside and frozen to death just at the Xinbu small platform. According to our understanding, the custom here is: "It doesn't matter how many boys are born, poor families want one girl, and rich families want two, and if there are more, they are thrown into the river." This bad custom of valuing men over women is too inhumane. Originally, men and women are the same, so why are women treated with such contempt and harm? In the new society, women also participate in various labors like men and make great contributions to the revolutionary cause, and especially in the future national construction, they are also shouldering half the responsibility. Harming girls in this way is tantamount to undermining the revolutionary cause. It is hoped that the local government will resolutely stop this custom of infringing on human rights.

　　Shi Caifu

　　Editor's note: The phenomena mentioned in Comrade Shi Caifu's letter should be given serious attention and resolutely stopped by the Anhui North Administrative Office, the Bengbu Municipal People's Government, and the Women's Federation.

    （一）望通县地区注意保护牲畜
    过春节后，在通县南边的大道上，几个农民架着一辆大车，车上的辕家伙俱全，车后边拴着一匹马，可是大车却由人推着走。当时我心里很奇怪，便搭讪着问一下，原来是这样：他们是住在南边某村的，应邀到北边一个村子参加大会。这匹马原来是斗争果实，土地改革后分给了几家贫农伙养着。使的时候几家争着，全怕吃亏了，可是谁也舍不得喂。结果马饿坏了。所以今天套上车刚走出来几里地，就拉不动了，没法子车子才由人推着走。
    这种不爱护牲口的情形，在附近几个刚实行土地改革的新区，是严重地存在着。去年秋天，通县地区还没有实行土地改革，秋收时，领导机关为了照顾缺乏畜力的贫农，曾经让地主富农拨牲口给贫农用。结果牲口连累带饿就死过不少。以通县七区的情况来说，差不多平均一百亩地还没有一头牲口。畜力如此缺乏，假如对现有的牲口再不加以适当保护，今年的农业生产一定要受到很大的影响。
    发生这种现象的原因：一是农民的觉悟不够，只看到眼前的一点小便宜，没有看到长远的利益。他们认为牲口是白来的（？），死了反正谁也没掏钱（编者按：这不是问题的本质，基本问题还是当地政府没有充分发动农民，及时将土地改革转入生产，并想尽一切办法保护农民已得的利益。）；一是领导上对伙养牲口没有适当的注意，没有把伙养的各户很好地组织起来。希望负责干部赶快对农民进行教育，指给他们长远的利益，说明斗争果实也是农民一滴血、一滴汗换来的。同时把伙养的各户科学地组织起来，尽可能不让“你吃亏了我占便宜”的情形发生。
    刘殿杰  三月九日
    编者按：请通县地区党和政府注意刘殿杰君的建议。这种严重残害牲口的现象，如果熟视无睹任其继续下去，对今后农业生产可能造成严重损失。希望当地党和人民政府的负责干部迅速调查并作有效的制止；最后将结果公开在报上发表。
    （二）坚决消灭溺婴的坏风俗
    我们因公到蚌埠月余以来，只在新埠小站台，就发现了两个刚生下来的小女孩，扔在路边冻死了。据我们了解，这里的风俗是：“男孩生多少没有关系，女孩穷的人家要一个，富的人家要两个，多了就扔到河里。”这种重男轻女的坏风俗，太惨无人道了。本来，男女都是一样的人，为什么就这样轻视残害妇女呢？在新社会里，妇女们也和男人一样参加各种劳动，和对革命事业付出伟大的贡献，特别是今后国家的各种建设，她们也正担负着一半的责任。这样残害女孩，就无异在破坏革命事业。希望当地政府坚决制止这种侵害人权的风俗。
    施才福
    编者按：施才福同志这封信中所说的现象，皖北行署和蚌埠市人民政府和妇联会应当加以严重注意，和坚决制止。
