To Increase People's Scientific Knowledge
    Widely Publicize the Causes of Lunar Eclipses
    Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education Issues Notice
    [Beijing News Agency] On the morning of April 3rd at 3:09 AM, a total lunar eclipse will be visible in our country. Because folk tales such as "heavenly dog eating the moon" and "giant toad eating the moon" still circulate, showing a lack of understanding of lunar eclipses and superstitious beliefs, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, in order to break superstitions and increase people's scientific knowledge, notified the people's cultural centers in the city and suburban areas of Mentougou, Gaobeidian, Changxindian, and Nanyuan to use wall newspapers, blackboard bulletins, public lectures, and other forms before April 3rd to explain the causes of lunar eclipses and the principles of the Earth and Moon's movements to the common people.
