　　Must Withstand the Test of Victory
    Cadres Who Haggle Over Salaries and Enjoyment Must Quickly Restore the Good Tradition of Hard Work and Plain Living

    The People's Daily published an investigative report on March 19 entitled "The Situation of Production Self-Salvation of Military Dependents in Disaster Areas." The author vividly introduced the living conditions of the people in the disaster areas and how they overcame difficulties and conquered the famine under the leadership and help of the government, focusing on several issues and several households. This report deeply moved me. I sincerely admire those staff members who go deep into the lower levels, share the joys and sorrows with the people, and serve the masses wholeheartedly. I recalled the hardships I endured during the guerrilla warfare in the Anti-Japanese War, and I repeatedly chewed on the sentence "Often some people cannot withstand the test of victory." We have already seen that some staff members in urban enterprise departments either haggle over the amount of their personal salaries, spending their days figuring out how to spend this money; or they are extravagant and wasteful in their management of institutions, or they commit bureaucracy in the management of enterprises, causing serious losses to the country. Among these people, there may be veteran cadres who have experienced hundreds of battles and hardships, or some may have been tested by enemy courts and battlefields, but today – in the face of victory – they have forgotten the compatriots in disaster areas who are still suffering, forgotten the compatriots who are still waiting to be liberated from the abyss of suffering, and the commanders and fighters who are exchanging their lives and blood for the liberation of the territory and the freedom of the people on the front lines. Isn't this failing to withstand the test of victory? We have a responsibility to sincerely tell these people that they should be vigilant, they should open their eyes to look further and downwards, and they should quickly restore and maintain the original glorious tradition of hard work and plain living.

　　要经得起胜利的考验
    斤斤计较薪金与享受的干部要快恢复艰苦朴素的好作风
    三月十九日人民日报载有《灾区军属生产自救情况》的一篇调查报告，作者就几个问题、几家灾户，将灾区人民的生活情况及如何在政府的领导和帮助下克服困难、战胜灾荒，作了生动的介绍。这篇报导深深感动着我。我衷心感佩那些深入下层、与民共甘苦一心为群众服务的工作人员。我回忆起抗日时期在游击战争环境中所经受的艰辛，我还反复咀嚼着“往往有些人经不起胜利的考验”这句话。我们已经看到：有个别身居在城市企业部门的工作人员，他们或者斤斤较量个人薪金的多少，整日满脑子盘算着如何花费这些钱；或者对机关管理铺张浪费，或者对企业管理犯了官僚主义，给国家招致严重的损失。在这些人们里也许有身经百战历经千辛万苦的老干部，也许有人曾经受过敌人的法庭和战场考验，但是今天——在胜利局面下，他们却忘记了还在受苦受难的灾胞，忘记了还在水深火热中待解放的同胞，还在前线以生命鲜血换取国土解放、人民自由的指战员。这岂不是经不起胜利的考验吗？我们有责任诚恳的告诉这些人应该警醒，应该睁开眼睛往远处、往下边看看，应该很快恢复与保持原有的艰苦朴素的光荣传统。
