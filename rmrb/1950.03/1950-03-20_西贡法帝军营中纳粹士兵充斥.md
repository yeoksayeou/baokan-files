    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] Electric News Agency Berlin: According to a letter from Vietnam published in the Heidelberg Daily News in the American-occupied zone of Berlin, more than half of the French Foreign Legion stationed in Vietnam are former German Nazi soldiers, as well as many fascist mercenaries of different nationalities. The letter also stated that in the French garrison outposts of Hanoi and Saigon, the Nazi Party anthem is often heard, which is the "true battle song" of the mercenaries stationed in Vietnam, and the French officers "are willing to turn a blind eye" to this.
