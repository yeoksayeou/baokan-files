Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th. TASS, Moscow, March 4th: The "Truth" newspaper editorial commenting on the Soviet Council of Ministers' decision to award Stalin Prizes for scientific research and production inventions stated: The awarding of the Stalin Prizes is a remarkable testament to the astonishing new achievements of advanced Soviet science and engineering under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin party. The Communist Party and the Soviet government have created all the conditions for the development of science and engineering, and the advanced Soviet science and engineering workers are guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism. In Soviet society, science is being used for the first time in human history to build communism for the people. Under the capitalist system, scientific achievements and technological reforms are being used to prepare for new wars, to further enrich a handful of exploiters, and to further enslave the working people. In the Soviet Union, all scientific achievements belong to the entire people and enable the Soviet state to successfully solve the greatest problems in the national economy. The glorious ranks of Stalin Prize winners have now been augmented by a team of 1,285 workers.
	Among the Stalin Prize winners, in addition to the famous scientists – academicians and professors – there are also workers, foremen, and advanced individuals in socialist agriculture who are completely proficient in modern technology and have achieved outstanding success in the invention and fundamental reform of production methods. This fact clearly shows the process of eliminating the difference between manual and mental labor that is taking place in our country. The achievements of Soviet science and engineering illustrate the soaring of the lofty creativity of our scientific and technological intellectuals, and the fact that science and culture have become accessible to the broad masses of working people. The editorial concluded: All the achievements of Soviet scientists and production pioneers are linked to the name of the master of science, the great Stalin. The great Stalin inspires Soviet scientists, engineers, inventors, and production pioneers to engage in creative labor for the prosperity of our socialist motherland.

　　苏联科学家生产先锋的成就
    与伟大斯大林名字连在一起
    真理报评颁发斯大林奖金
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：真理报社论评论苏联部长会议颁发关于科学研究及生产发明的斯大林奖金的决定称：斯大林奖金的颁发，是先进的苏联科学与工程学在伟大的列宁与斯大林党领导下获得惊人新成就的显著证明。共产党与苏维埃政府给科学与工程学的发展创设了一切条件，苏联的先进的科学与工程学工作者是为马列主义的理论所指导的。在苏维埃社会中，科学在人类历史上第一次被用来为人民建设共产主义而服务。在资本主义制度下，科学成就和技术改革正被用来准备新战争，使一小撮剥削者更加致富，使劳动人民更受奴役。在苏联，一切科学成就归全体人民所有，并使苏维埃国家得以成功地解决国民经济中各种最大的问题。斯大林奖金获奖者的光荣大军，现在又增加了一支一千二百八十五名工作者的队伍。
    在斯大林奖金获奖者中，除了著名的科学家——院士与教授们——之外，还有完全精通近代化技术且在生产方法的发明与根本改革上获有卓越成就的工人、领班和社会主义农业的先进者。这一事实明显地表示出我国正在进行着的消除体力劳动与脑力劳动间差别的过程。苏联科学与工程学的成就，说明了我们科学界与技术界知识分子崇高的创造力的高涨，说明了科学与文化已为广大的劳动人民所接近这一事实。社论结语称：苏维埃科学家与生产开路先锋的一切成就，是与科学大师、伟大的斯大林的名字连在一起的。伟大的斯大林鼓舞着苏联科学家、工程师、发明家和生产上的开路先锋，为我们社会主义祖国的繁荣，来从事创造性的劳动。
