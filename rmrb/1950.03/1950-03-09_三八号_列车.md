　　"March 8th" Train
    Zhou Ming
    In June 1949, nine young women came to the Dalian Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway to learn how to drive trains. They were determined to become the first female drivers to appear on the people's railways of New China. On "March 8th" in 1950, the first train driven by these young women departed from Dalian. This train would have the glorious title of "March 8th."
    "March 8th" precisely symbolizes the fate of women in New China. The Communist Party of China has laid an infinitely promising track for her, Mao Zedong's banner points towards a bright direction, and the Soviet brothers have cared for and cultivated her. She will sound a long whistle, greet the glory of victory, and head towards this infinitely bright avenue.
    Tian Guiying, a 21-year-old girl from a fishing family with a round face and big eyes, initially sold meal tickets in the cafeteria of the China Changchun Railway Dalian Locomotive Depot. A girl who had been working since the age of seven was strong-willed. "Why should I sit here? I can operate machines just like the men!" She abandoned the clean and refined ways and became a greasy female worker in the light oil vehicle repair shop.
    Wang Baohong, her parents said she should find a good family and get married. However, Wang Baohong came to the locomotive depot and became a repair worker for light oil vehicles.
    There are also these two girls: Dai Shuzhen, who waited at the window to sell tickets; and Cheng Shulan, a train attendant who traveled with the train.
    They were all familiar with that strongman – the locomotive. Fed with enough coal and water, and having consumed enough oil, it roared and dragged a long string of trains, delivering goods and passengers and bringing new goods and passengers from distant places. The train sneezed and puffed, then roared out. However, in the hands of the drivers, it was as tame as a lamb. People said that driving was a "special responsibility" for men, and girls should embroider flowers.
    "Why not? We can also manage it, we can also become drivers!" Tian Guiying, Wang Baohong, Cheng Shulan, and Dai Shuzhen thought this way.
    Really, why not? Women in New China should be independent and autonomous. They are no longer anyone's appendages, they will contribute their labor and wisdom in the new society, and work and create like men. – This is the path of women's liberation! Soviet Section Chief Lisov thought this way, and he wanted to do this: to open up new paths for the new women of New China, to stand up and contribute to building a new China, and to strive for the complete liberation of women. He wanted to train a group of female drivers for light oil vehicles, and he also wanted to train female train drivers.
    Tian Guiying was the first to sign up. Wang Baohong, Cheng Shulan, and Dai Shuzhen also wrote their names. And there was Wang Guiqing, who was far away in Shenyang, who had only worked in a clothing factory for a few months after graduating from elementary school. As soon as she heard that Dalian was recruiting female train drivers, she rushed over. There were also Zhou Shuzhen, Bi Guiying, Song Guijin, and Li Wenyu, all four of whom were rural young women. When they saw the newspaper publishing that female drivers were being trained, they dropped their hoes and ran to the locomotive depot.
    "Isn't this a joke, how can they do this?" Some people said this.
    Tian Guiying said: "What male comrades can do, we can do!" The nine of them guaranteed in unison: "Complete the study tasks on schedule and operate the locomotive independently."
    They studied for nine months and a few days, and by March 8th, they were "operating the locomotive independently." It seems that nine months is not a short time, but compared to three years, it seems too short. Generally, to become a locomotive driver, one has to throw ash into the furnace, stoke the fire, and endure it for three or four years. On January 10, 1950, Tian Guiying, Wang Baohong, and Bi Guiying became apprentice drivers. They had already begun to drive trains for long distances, and from being unfamiliar, they became skilled, and were able to operate with boldness. Wang Baohong said: "When I first got on the train, both hands were too busy, but now one hand can do it calmly." Yes! Pulling the whistle, opening and closing the steam valve, and aligning the reversing gear, these tasks really require two hands to be busy. In the cold weather, they didn't feel cold. When the train was running, their heads were stretched out of the car window, their hands were on the hand window, their faces were numb with cold, and their hands were swollen. They didn't even feel the heat when they put their hands on the extremely hot steam gauge. But, they were all happy, and never complained of hardship.
    Cheng Shulan, Zhou Shuzhen, and Dai Shuzhen are stokers; Song Guijin, Li Wenyu, and Wang Guiqing are firemen. They work separately with male comrades. When they first worked with male comrades, they felt a bit restrained, neither standing nor sitting, and even felt embarrassed to talk about going to the toilet; now it's completely different. They are no longer restrained, and they are also bold, and they work the same as the male comrades. Although the six of them did not become apprentice drivers like Tian Guiying, Wang Baohong, and Bi Guiying, they are not discouraged, on the contrary, they work harder. Cheng Shulan said: "We didn't become apprentice drivers because our study results were not good. In the future, we only need to work hard and study actively."
    With drivers, stokers, and firemen, one locomotive needs three shifts of personnel, and the nine of them can manage one locomotive. In nine months, the nine young women completed their study tasks. The achievements of these nine months are inseparable from the young women's hard work, the Soviet comrades, and the teachers who patiently taught them. Tian Guiying said: "To be honest, this nine-month road was really not easy to walk, but with the help of the Party, the Youth League, the Soviet comrades, and all the workers in the section, we were able to walk through it steadily."
    At the beginning, they studied how to throw ash into the furnace. – Throwing ash into the furnace is not embroidering flowers, it is not moving abacus beads, but shoveling one shovel after another, choking the throat, and dirty, but they did it very happily. Two weeks later, they asked to get on the train to stoke the fire, and the section chief agreed to their request.
    Although they are female comrades, when they start working, they don't fall behind the male comrades. Usually, two male comrades shovel and throw coal, averaging about 280 shovels in fifteen minutes, while they throw about 230 shovels in fifteen minutes. The workers were all surprised, and even Deputy Section Chief Li Qingrong gave a thumbs up and said: "Based on this alone, you can learn successfully! Really good!" This is their achievement when they first started working on the train. Because their own wishes were realized, they were very excited when they first started working on the train. They worked one shift every day, and they didn't feel tired at all; the superiors were afraid that they would get too tired, so they wanted to rotate one shift every three days, but they were unwilling. Looking at the superiors when they didn't see, they secretly got on the train. Finally, they were found out by the superiors, and they were asked to write a "statement of reasons" and guarantee that they would never do such excessive work again. Because of the joy of work, their work enthusiasm was very high. Sometimes they didn't eat or didn't bring food when running shifts, only caring about actively doing a good job and familiarizing themselves with the work. After the labor hero Li Qingrong found out about this, he checked their lunch boxes every day when he went to and from work, and was not allowed to get on the train without taking food, and was not allowed to get off the train without eating. In order to take care of their daily lives, the superiors also issued them 200 kilograms of rice. The superiors cared for them in this way, and they themselves deeply felt this point. The nine of them often said: "We have to work harder to learn the skills, otherwise how can we be worthy of the superiors' care and cultivation of us?"
    Although the nine of them have a low level of education, the highest is only six years of schooling, everyone has the confidence to overcome this difficulty and actively learn technology and theory. Soviet comrade Lisov came to talk with them for one or two hours every day, teaching them technical theory. Many old drivers also constantly came to help them study. Often in the middle of the night, the nine of them were still studying head to head.
    The four teachers designated by the superiors are all patiently teaching them. After they learn, they go to the train to study in practice. This method of learning and then being able to use it makes them feel very happy. In the first few days, when they finished working on the train, the workers asked: "Can you do this job with this dirty look?" "We don't mind being dirty! We are all young people, why can't we do it?" Their answer was so straightforward.
    Their learning achievements are advancing by leaps and bounds. In more than two months, they understood the locomotive structure, the proper degree of fire, the "big end" pressure oil, the hot test of the main connecting rod big end and how to deal with it, and the work of filling oil. At the same time, they all understood the operating procedures, such as various "signals," switches, and dispatching order. After they finished working every day, they questioned each other and exchanged experiences. When working on the locomotive, they watched how the driver operated the machine and how to watch the signals whenever they had free time. After work, they looked for old drivers to teach them the technology whenever they had free time. Their learning is always active.
    In early September 1949, the superiors issued an order to test them, and those with good results would be promoted to stokers. As a result, only two failed, and the rest were promoted to stokers. Although some were promoted and some were still firemen, everyone's work enthusiasm was still extremely high.
    They have also suffered setbacks in their studies. But they are not afraid of hardship. They have a lot of labor enthusiasm! However, they still need a high degree of confidence.
    While driving the train, Tian Guiying hit a large flatbed car on the Lushun line, knocking off the wheels of the large car; Wang Baohong "rushed out" in Yingchengzi, and Bi Guiying also had a "rush forward" once. Because they were timid, when the accident happened, they were stunned and did not dare to get off the train. Therefore, for a period of time, all three of them wanted to quit, feeling that this job was too dangerous. On February 1st, Dai Shuzhen hit her head on the iron plate while reversing the car at the North Station, and blood was flowing, and it took more than half a month to heal the injury. When Dai Shuzhen was injured, the eight firemen were uneasy, fearing for their lives. Fortunately, they were all persuaded by the old driver and the section chief, and the nine people mustered up their courage again and worked enthusiastically.
    The road is difficult and needs people to walk. Women need greater perseverance to embark on a brand new road.
    "March 8th" of 1950 is an extraordinary day. The glory of victory shines everywhere. The Kuomintang bandits on the mainland have been eliminated, the People's Republic of China has been established, and Chinese women have been liberated from the state of being oppressed and enslaved and have become the masters of New China. We hear the call of the motherland: Women arise and contribute all their strength to build a new China! And we see nine young women overcome difficulties and drive the first train driven by young women on the railways of New China.

　　“三八号”列车
    周铭
    一九四九年六月，九个女青年来到中长铁路大连机务段参加学习开火车。她们下决心要成为第一批女司机，出现在新中国的人民铁道上。一九五○年的“三八”节，中国第一列由女青年们驾驶着的火车从大连开出。这辆火车将要领有“三八号”的光荣称号。
    “三八号”正是象征着新中国妇女的命运。中国共产党为她铺设了前途无限的轨道，毛泽东的大旗指向着光明的方向，苏联兄长们照拂了培养了她，她将汽笛长鸣着，迎接胜利的光辉，走向这条光明无限的大道。
    渔家出身的二十一岁的姑娘田桂英，圆圆的脸，大大的眼睛，起先她在中长铁路大连机务段食堂卖饭票。打七岁就参加劳动的姑娘是刚强的。“为什么要坐在这里？我能够和他们男人一样使唤机器！”她丢开了干干净净、斯斯文文的一套，成为轻油车修理处的油腻的女工。
    王宝鸿，父母说她应该找个好婆家，好出阁了。然而王宝鸿来到了机务段，她变成了轻油车的修理工。
    还有这两位姑娘：戴淑贞，守候在窗口卖车票；程淑兰，是跟着火车跑的列车员。
    她们都熟悉那样的大力士——机车，喂足了煤和水，吃够了油就呼啸着拖着成长串的列车飞跑，送去货物、旅客，又把新的货物、旅客由远远的地方装来。在火车上打着喷嚏着气，又怒吼着冲出去。然而在司机们的手下，它却驯良得像小羊。人们都说，司机是男人的“专责”，姑娘们，最好是绣花绣朵。
    “为什么不呢？我们也能管理它，我们一样的能成为司机！”田桂英、王宝鸿、程淑兰、戴淑贞却这样想。
    真的，为什么不呢？新中国的妇女应该独立自主，她们不再是任何人的附属品，她们将在新社会里贡献她们的劳力和智慧，将和男子们一样地工作创造。——这就是妇女解放的道路！苏联段长李索夫是这样想的，而且他要这样做：为新中国的新妇女打开新的道路，站起来贡献力量建设新中国，争取妇女的彻底解放，他要培养一批轻油车的女司机，而且，他还要培养火车的女司机。
    田桂英第一个报名。王宝鸿、程淑兰、戴淑贞也把名字写上了。还有远在沈阳的王贵卿，高小下了学刚进被服厂作了几个月的工，一听见大连要收火车女司机就赶来了。还有周淑贞、毕桂英、宋桂金、李雯彧，她们四个都是农村的女青年，见到报上登着培养女司机，就丢了锄头奔向机务段。
    “这不是笑话，她们那能干这个？”有人这样说。
    田桂英说：“男同志能干的活，咱们就能干！”她们九个人异口同声地下了保证：“按期完成学习任务，单独操纵机车。”
    她们学习了九个月另几天，到三月八日她们就“单独操纵机车”了。看起来九个月的时间不算短，比起三年来就显得时间太短了，一般要成为机车驾驶，得投炉灰、烧火，熬他个三年四载的。一九五○年一月十日，田桂英、王宝鸿、毕桂英三个人成了练习司机，她们已经开始长途地驾驶火车，并且由生疏而熟练，都能大胆地操纵了。王宝鸿说：“刚一上车两只手都忙不过来，现在一只手就从从容容的干过来了。”是的！拉笛、开闭汽门、对逆转机，这些工作真得两只手来忙。寒冷天里，她们都没有感到冷，火车行驶的时候，脑袋伸在车窗外面，手放在手窗上，脸冻麻木了，手冻肿了，把手放到极热的汽表上都不感觉热，但是，她们都是愉快的，向来没有叫过苦的时候。
    程淑兰、周淑贞、戴淑贞她三个人是司炉；宋桂金、李雯彧、王贵卿是火夫，她们分开来和男同志在一起工作。在刚一分手与男同志一起工作时，就感觉有些拘束，站着不是，坐着也不是，连上便所都不好意思讲出来；现在完全不同了，她们不拘束了，也都大胆了，和男同志一样的干。她们六个人虽然没有和田桂英、王宝鸿、毕桂英一样的当上练习司机，但她们却不灰心，相反的更加努力。程淑兰这样说：“我们没有当上练习司机，是因为我们学习成绩不好，以后我们只要努力工作、积极学习就行了。”
    司机有了，司炉有了，火夫有了，一辆机车需要三班人员，她们九个人正好管理一辆机车。九个月，九个女青年完成了她们的学习任务。这九个月的成绩是与女青年们刻苦奋斗，和苏联同志及耐心教她们的老师们分不开的。田桂英说：“照实说这九个月的道路是真不容易走的，可是有了党、团和苏联同志以及全段工友帮助，我们可稳稳当当地走过来了。”
    开始时，她们学习投炉灰。——投炉灰可不是绣花绣朵，可不是拨算盘珠儿，而是一锨一锨的扒，一锨一锨的投，呛嗓子，又肮脏，然而她们干得非常愉快。两个星期以后，她们要求上车烧火，段长答应了她们的要求。
    她们虽是女同志，干起活来，却不落在男同志之后。平常两个男同志一扒一投的扔煤，十五分钟平均二百八十锨左右，而她们连扒带投十五分钟投二百三十锨左右。工友们都很惊讶，连副段长李庆荣都伸出大姆指头说：“就凭这一点，你们也能学成功！真行！”这是她们刚开始在火车上工作的成绩。因为她们自己的愿望实现了，刚一到火车上工作的时候，都兴奋得不得了，每天一个班，她们一点不感到累；上级恐怕她们累坏了，要三天轮一个班，但是她们却不愿意，瞅着上级没看见，自己就偷着上了火车。最后被上级查出，曾经叫她们写过“理由书”，并保证以后再不这样过分的干。因为工作的快活，她们的工作热情很高，有时候不吃饭或者跑班的时候不带饭，只顾积极的搞好工作，熟悉工作。这件事情被劳动英雄李庆荣知道了以后，就每天上下班检查她们的饭盒子，不拿饭不准上车，没吃饭不准下车。为了照顾她们的日常生活，上级还发给她们二百公斤大米。上级是这样关心她们，她们自己也深深感到了这点。她们九个人经常这样说：“咱们得加劲学本领啊，要不是怎么能对得住上级对咱们的关心和培养呢？”
    虽然她们九个人文化水平很低，最高的不过念了六年书，但是每个人都有信心克服这个困难，积极学习技术、理论。苏联同志李索夫每天都来和她们座谈一两点钟，教给她们技术理论。好多老司机也都不断的来帮助她们学习。往往到了深更半夜，九个人还头碰头的在学习着。
    上级指定的四名老师，都是耐心的教她们。她们学了之后，就到车上实际研究。这样学了就能用的方法，使她们感到非常高兴。最初几天，她们在车上工作完了时，工友们就问：“弄得这个脏样，你们能干这活吗？”“我们不嫌脏！我们都是青年，为什么不能干？”她们的答复就是这样干脆。
    她们的学习成绩是突飞猛进的。在两个多月内，她们就了解了机车构造，火的适度，“大端子”压油，主连杆大端的热度试验和怎样处理以及灌油等工作。同时，她们还都懂得了运转规程，像各种“信号”，道叉转线器，发车秩序等工作。她们每天工作完了，都彼此考问及交流经验。在机车上工作时，她们一有空闲，便观看司机怎样操纵机器，怎样看信号。下班后，她们一有空闲，便去找老司机教技术。她们的学习，每时每刻都是主动的。
    一九四九年九月初旬，上级下来了命令，要测验她们，成绩好的提升为司炉。结果只有两名没有合格，其余的都升上了司炉。虽然有的提升了，有的还是火夫，但大家工作热情仍极高涨。
    他们在学习中也受过挫折。但她们不怕吃苦。她们有的是劳动热情！然而，她们还须要高度的信心。
    在驾驶火车中，田桂英在旅顺线上，撞了一辆大板车，把大车的车轮碰掉了；王宝鸿在营城子“冒出”，毕桂英也弄了一次“冒进”，因为她们胆小，当事故发生的时候，吓得目瞪口呆，都不敢下火车了。因此有一个时期她们三个人都想不干了，感觉这个工作太危险。二月一日戴淑贞在北站倒车，将头撞在铁板上，鲜血直流，半个多月才把伤养好。戴淑贞受伤的时候，八个火夫都不安心，恐怕丢掉性命。幸好他们都被老司机、段长给讲通了，九个人又鼓足勇气，又热情的干起来。
    道路是艰巨的，须要人来走。妇女们要走上崭新的道路，需要更高的毅力。
    一九五○年的“三八”节是不平凡的日子，胜利的光辉普照着，大陆上的国民党匪帮扫除了，中华人民共和国成立了，中国妇女已经从被压迫被奴役的状态中解放出来，成为新中国的主人翁，我们听到祖国的召唤：妇女们起来，贡献一切力量建设新中国！而我们看到九个女青年战胜了困难，驾驶着第一列由女青年驾驶的火车出现在新中国的铁路上。
