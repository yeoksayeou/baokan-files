　　Workers and Peasants are as Close as Brothers
    Tangshan Workers Care for the Suffering of Disaster Victims
    Extend Warm Condolences in the Disaster Areas of Hebei
    Receive Enthusiastic Welcome from Local Disaster-Stricken Peasants
    Enhance Production Enthusiasm and Hard Work Spirit
    [By Our Newspaper] North China News: On February 6th, under the proposal of workers and the leadership of the Tangshan General Trade Union, factories and mines in Tangshan organized a 68-person disaster area condolence团 to extend condolences to disaster-stricken compatriots in the disaster areas of Hebei. Led by Yang Jixian, Minister of Labor Protection of the Municipal General Trade Union, the group was divided into three teams and seven groups, carrying the trade union's letter of condolence and funds from the 10,000 catties of red grain raised by workers last year. After prior contact with local leading organs, they went directly to the severely affected second and third districts of Ninghe. Each group extended condolences to two villages, reaching out to households and directly, or through the village, distributed condolence money. The condolence团 stayed in the villages for two days and three nights, receiving a warm welcome from the families of martyrs, soldiers, workers, and ordinary peasants. They were very grateful for their enthusiasm. In conversations with the peasants, the workers more clearly understood the peasants' sacrifices of blood and support for the front; they were greatly moved to see them eating chaff and vegetable skins, while none of the old or young complained. Some workers said: "Giving up some year-end bonuses and suffering a little is nothing!"
    During the condolences, the peasants welcomed and saw them off from afar, treated them cordially, and vacated warm kang beds for the workers to sleep on. Some peasants, because they could not bear to see the condolence团 workers eating chaff with them at every meal, sadly shed tears as they picked up their bowls. Some crushed the only remaining handful of red grain and mixed it with chaff to cook noodle soup for the workers, which moved the workers to embrace and cry.
    Zhang Fuhe, a peasant in Malianxinzhuang, said: "We workers and peasants are one family. In the past, the enemy destroyed our relationship!" An old lady Zhang in the village even recognized Hou Ruizhi, a female worker from Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory in the condolence团, as her goddaughter. Some workers also examined their own erroneous ideas of looking down on peasants.
    The peasants' determination and perseverance in adhering to production and overcoming difficulties gave the workers in the condolence团 great encouragement and education. The workers saw that many peasants, although they had sold their livestock due to a lack of grain, expressed their determination to sow seeds in the spring by manpower. Although they had no grain to eat at the moment, they all saved wheat seeds in their pockets. When the condolence团 was about to leave, the peasants universally said: "Go back and do a good job in production, don't worry about us. We have the confidence to overcome difficulties and get through the famine. We will never starve to death!" The workers also vowed to do a good job in production and economy after returning to the factory to repay their peasant brothers. From the twenty-third day of the lunar December to the Spring Festival, workers at the Huaxin Textile Factory worked full shifts, which was unprecedented since the opening of Huaxin. Tong Zigong, a worker at Desheng, wrote to the General Trade Union after returning to Tangshan: "I will definitely work hard in production in the future!"
    Through this visit to the disaster area to extend condolences, personally eating chaff and vegetables with the peasants, and personally seeing the peasants' lack of clothing and food, some workers' backward economic views and comfort-seeking thoughts were also overcome. When the representatives of Huaxin Textile Factory returned to convey the situation, some workers were moved to tears. More than a dozen people donated on the spot, and some even took out a bag of flour. Without the mobilization of the trade union, recent donations have reached 10 million yuan. It was difficult to adjust the wages of Qixin Porcelain Factory, which were originally too high, but after the return of the condolence团, some workers understood. Railway workers voluntarily reported lower wages, saying: "Seeing the suffering of our peasant brothers, we are nothing!"

　　工人农民亲如手足
    唐山工人关怀灾民疾苦
    深入河北灾区热情慰问
    受到当地被灾农民热烈欢迎
    提高了生产热情和刻苦精神
    【本报讯】华北消息：唐山各厂矿在工人提议及市总工会领导下，于二月六日组织了六十八人的灾区慰问团，前往河北灾区慰问被灾同胞。该团由市总工会劳保部长杨继先带领，下分三队七组，带了工会的慰问信及去年工人募集的万斤红粮的款子，经当地领导机关事先联络后，即直接到宁河灾情严重的二、三区去。每组慰问两村，按户深入慰问，并直接或由村中分发了慰问款。慰问团共在各村住了两天三夜，受到烈、军、工属和一般农民的热烈欢迎。对他们的热情非常感激。工人们在与农民的谈话中更清楚地明白了农民们流血牺牲，参战支前的情况；看到他们吃着糠菜麸皮，而所有老小没有一个抱怨的情形而大受感动，有的工人说：“我们放弃点年终花红，吃点苦，真算不了啥！”
    慰问中，农民都远道迎送，殷勤招待，腾出热炕来让工人睡。有的农民因为不忍心让慰问团的工人顿顿跟他们一齐吃糠，端起碗来曾难过的落泪。有的就把仅存下来的一把红粮碾碎掺糠，给工人煮面糊吃，以致使工人感动得相互拥抱而哭。
    马连新庄一个农民张福和说：“咱们工农一家人，过去让敌人把咱们的关系破坏了！”该村的一个张老大娘，并认慰问团的唐山华新纱厂女工侯瑞芝作了干女儿。有的工人并检讨出自己看不起农民的错误思想。
    农民坚持生产，克服困难的决心和毅力给了慰问团工人们以很大的激励和教育。工人们看到许多农民虽然因为缺粮食把牲口卖了，但表示决心用人力在春天把种子播下地。他们虽然眼下就没粮食吃，但口袋中却都省的有麦种。慰问团临走时，农民普遍地说：“回去好好生产，不要惦记我们。我们有信心能克服困难，渡过灾荒，决不会饿死！”工人们也都纷纷立誓，回厂后一定搞好生产节约，报答农民弟兄。华新纱厂旧历腊月二十三日到春节，工人们完全到班开车，为华新开办以来所未有。德盛工友佟子功回唐山后写信给总工会说：“以后绝对努力生产！”
    经过这次至灾区慰问，和农民亲自在一道吃糠菜，亲自看到农民无衣无食的情景，部分工人落后的经济观点和舒适念头，亦得到了克服。华新纱厂代表回来传达时，工人们有的听得哭了。当场并有十几人捐助，还有拿出一袋面的。未经工会发动，最近已募捐达千余万元。启新磁厂原来工资过高，调整时，工作很难作，慰问团归来后，有些工人就想通了。铁路工人自动报低工资说：“看了农民弟兄的苦，咱们不算啥！”
