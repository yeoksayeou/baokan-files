　　First Tractor Training Class Graduates
　　Students Depart for Work Across Various Regions
　　[Report from this newspaper] The first class of the Tractor Training Program, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, comprised over 450 students. Following the graduation ceremony held on the 9th, they have departed for work in provinces including Hebei, Pingyuan, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, Shandong, Chahar, and Ningxia. This training program commenced in mid-December of last year, and the students were tractor workers drawn from across the nation. During the program, students from different regions exchanged experiences from their work and learned new technologies and agricultural knowledge. Through group research, they developed preliminary experience in the organization, management, and operation of state-owned mechanized farms. They also gained a further understanding of the overall situation of mechanized farms nationwide, enabling leading organs to allocate resources more systematically this year. Simultaneously, through discussions among students from various regions, they initially standardized the different names for tractors and farm tools used across different localities, making future exchange of experiences more convenient.
　　During the learning process, some peasant students demonstrated a high level of enthusiasm and outstanding wisdom. Although their educational level was low, they achieved good results through diligent study and mutual assistance within groups. For example, peasant student Yang Guoqing only began learning to write after arriving in Tianjin last year. When he joined the class, he was unable to take notes. However, relying on his memory and working diligently, he achieved an average score of nearly 70 in four exams, reaching the standard of general students. Yang Chunqing was also a rural youth who was initially illiterate. However, during last year's learning, he not only mastered the machinery and learned mechanized farming but also acquired literacy and is now able to take notes.
　　For some students and instructors from intellectual backgrounds, this collective learning experience also changed their petty-bourgeois consciousness, such as arrogance. They tempered themselves among the workers and peasants, strengthened their labor perspective, and recognized the importance of integrating with the worker-peasant masses and how to integrate. It also changed the tendency of some students to focus solely on learning about tractors, neglecting the study of farm tools and general agricultural knowledge. Everyone realized that learning about tractors is to serve agriculture, not to learn for the sake of tractors themselves.
　　The shortcomings in the learning process were, first, that most of the cadres in the class were temporarily transferred from farms across various regions, and after three months they would return to their respective farms, which inevitably led to a temporary work mentality. Moreover, the learning lacked thorough planning; the time was short, and the students' levels varied. The teaching work became passive, and the work appeared rushed and chaotic. There was a lack of inspection during the learning, and some of the experiences from various regions were not summarized. These can all serve as lessons for running such short-term training programs in the future.

### 拖拉机训练班第一期毕业  学员分赴各地工作

　　拖拉机训练班第一期毕业
    学员分赴各地工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部举办的第一期拖拉机训练班学员四百五十余人，于九日举行毕业典礼后，已分别出发前往河北、平原、河南、江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南、山西、山东、察哈尔、宁夏等省工作。此期训练班于去年十二月中旬开学，学员是抽调的全国各地拖拉机工作人员。在学习期间，各地学员互相交换了工作中的经验，学习了新的技术和农业知识。并通过小组研究，得出了国营机械农场的组织、管理与经营上的初步经验。对全国机械耕作农场的概况也有了进一步的了解，使领导机关今年能更有系统地配备力量。同时，经过各地学员的商讨，初步地统一了拖拉机与农具上的各地不同的名称，使今后各地交流经验较为方便。
    在学习中，一部分农民学员表现了高度的学习热情和优异的智慧，他们虽然文化程度很低，但通过苦心学习和小组互助，获得了很好的成绩。如农民学员杨国卿，去年到天津后才开始学写字，到班里学习时，不能记笔记，然而他凭脑力记忆，痛下工夫，结果，他在四次考试中总平均成绩将近七十分，达到一般学员水准。杨春青也是农村青年，本来一个字都不识，但在去年的学习中，不但搞通了机器，学会机耕，还学了文化，现在已会记笔记了。
    对于一部分知识分子出身的学员和教员，经过这次集体性的学习，也改变了他们自高自大等小资产阶级意识，在工农群众里锻炼了自己，加强了劳动观点，认识了和工农群众结合的重要性及怎样结合的方法。也改变了一部分学员单纯重视拖拉机的学习，忽视农具及农业常识学习的偏向，大家认识了学习拖拉机是为农业服务，并不是为了拖拉机而学习。
    学习中的缺点，首先是班里干部多是各地农场临时抽调来的，三个月后就回各场工作，所以不免产生了临时工作思想。而且在学习上缺乏周密的计划性；时间短，学员程度不齐；教学工作形成被动，工作显得忙乱。学习中缺乏检查，各地经验还有一部分未总结出来。这些都可作为今后办这种短期训练班的教训。
