　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st: Constantly improving the old production organization and management system is one of the major gains of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China in the campaign to create new production records. Since the new record campaign was widely launched in various factories and mines in September of last year, on the one hand, production has been improved due to the emergence of new record achievements, and on the other hand, many problems have been exposed in production organization, raw material supply, and leadership structure; the deeper the movement, the more obvious these problems become. For example, the Bapanling Iron Mine of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company failed to deal with long-standing safety issues in a timely manner, and as a result, new records were created, but the tunnels collapsed, causing losses to national wealth. Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 3 did not pay enough attention to the inspection system in the past. Although many new records have appeared, the number of defective products has also increased. Even more factories and mines have suffered serious losses in production due to lack of coordination and underutilization of equipment. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government conducted a typical investigation of the No. 1 and No. 2 Manufacturing Workshops of Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 5, and found that out of a total of 208 various lathes in the two workshops, 27.4 percent of the lathes were frequently stopped. The main reason is that the various processes cannot be closely coordinated, and the castings cannot keep up with the needs of machine processing, which affects the latter and forces it to stop work. Therefore, overcoming these shortcomings has become an important key to consolidating and improving the new record campaign.
　　The problems exposed in the production organization and management system of various factories and mines not only illustrate the need to transform the old institutions and systems, but also educate management cadres at all levels to recognize the importance of establishing an economic accounting system ideologically. Before the start of the new record campaign, Hegang Coal Mine inherited the old management methods of the puppet Manchukuo, and the production organization was very scattered. In the new record campaign, the mine conducted a careful and bold transformation, concentrating 352 coal mining areas into 144, so that the efficiency of machinery, labor, and security equipment could be fully utilized. Now the tunneling efficiency has increased four times compared with October last year, material consumption has been reduced by half, and the cost of coal has been greatly reduced. At the same time, the coal mining method has been improved, so that about 80% of the coal in thick coal seams can be mined, overcoming the phenomenon that about two-thirds to three-quarters of the coal was abandoned underground in the past. Many other factories and mines have also made many improvements in various systems based on the new situation of in-depth development of the new record campaign. For example, after the timber yard of Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Factory appropriately allocated manpower and improved working methods, there were 18 fewer people than during the puppet Manchukuo period, but the daily output exceeded 1.8 times the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period. After the Andong Paper Mill changed the overlapping and multi-headed administrative organization in the past, it not only made the command of all work in the production process unified and flexible, but also enabled the various processes to be organically coordinated. Many factories and mines that lacked or had unsound finished product inspection systems, periodic mechanical repair systems, raw material receipt, dispatch and storage systems, and strict shift handover systems in the past have been established or have begun to be strengthened; some have also formulated new technical norms and implemented piece-rate or hourly extra-quota bonus wage systems, which have played a great role in consolidating and stimulating workers' production enthusiasm.
　　However, to improve the old production organization and management system, factory managers must be familiar with and proficient in their business. Therefore, mutual exchange of experience, especially learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, is very important. At present, although cadres in various factories and mines in Northeast China have generally paid attention to this point, and many have actively studied their business, not all cadres have learned enterprise management. On the contrary, the phenomena of irresponsibility in management systems and lax production discipline in many factories and mines still exist seriously. To this end, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a decision on the production responsibility system at the end of February, the purpose of which is to continue to improve the old production organization and management system, and reward employees' inventions and rationalization proposals, so as to achieve comprehensive implementation of scientific quota management, so that the future new record campaign can be carried out more thoroughly and systematically on the basis of establishing and strengthening the production responsibility system and production discipline.

### 东北工矿在创纪录运动中  生产组织不断改进  成为巩固与提高运动的重要关键

　　东北工矿在创纪录运动中
    生产组织不断改进
    成为巩固与提高运动的重要关键
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】不断改进旧的生产组织和管理制度，是东北国营企业在创造生产新纪录运动中的重大收获之一。自去年九月新纪录运动在各厂矿普遍展开以后，一方面因新纪录事迹的出现而提高了生产，另一方面则暴露出在生产组织、原料供应、领导机构等方面存在着许多毛病；运动愈是深入，这方面的毛病就暴露得愈加明显。如本溪煤铁公司八盘岭铁矿，对于早就存在的安全问题没有及时处理，结果新纪录创造了，坑道却崩塌了，使国家财富遭受损失。沈阳机械三厂过去对检查制度注意不够，虽然新纪录出现不少，但废品也随之增加。甚至更多的厂矿，因工作不衔接，设备不能充分利用，以致在生产中造成严重的损失。东北人民政府工业部曾对沈阳机械五厂一、二制造所作了典型调查，发现该两所共有各种车床二百零八台，经常停止开动的竟占车床总数的百分之二十七点四。究其原因，主要是各工序不能密切配合，铸件赶不上机器加工的需要，以致影响后者不得不停工。因此克服上述这些弊病，便成为巩固与提高新纪录运动的重要关键。
    各厂矿在生产组织和管理制度上所暴露的毛病，不但说明了旧机构与旧制度的必须改造，而且也教育了各级管理干部在思想上认识到确立经济核算制度的重要。鹤岗煤矿在新纪录运动开始前，因袭伪满旧的经营方法，生产组织十分分散。在新纪录运动中，该矿即进行了慎重而大胆的改造，将三百五十二个采煤地方，集中为一百四十四个，使机械、劳动力、保安设备等效能得以充分发挥。现在掘进效能较去年十月份提高四倍，材料消耗减少一半，大大降低了煤的成本。同时还改善了采煤方法，使厚煤层的煤，可采出百分之八十左右，克服了过去约三分之二至四分之三的煤被遗弃在地下的现象。其他许多工厂和矿山，也都根据新纪录运动深入发展的新情况，在各种制度上作了许多改进。如沈阳第五机械厂制材场适当配备了人力改进工作方法后，人员比伪满时期少十八个，每日产量反超过伪满最高时一点八倍。安东造纸厂改变了过去重叠多头的行政机构后，不仅使生产过程中的一切工作指挥统一灵活，并使各工序之间能有机地配合。许多厂矿过去所缺乏或不健全的成品检查制、机械按期修理制、原材料收发保管制、严格的交接班次制等，都已建立或开始加强；有的并制定了新的技术定额，实行了计件或计时超额奖励工资制度，对于巩固和激发工人的生产情绪，都起了很大作用。
    但是，要改进旧的生产组织和管理制度，工厂管理人员必须熟悉与精通业务。因此互相交流经验，特别是学习苏联的先进经验，就非常重要。目前东北各厂矿干部中虽已对这一点引起普遍注意，许多并已积极钻研业务，但也不是所有干部都已学会了企业管理。相反，不少厂矿管理制度上的无人负责和生产纪律松懈的现象，仍然严重存在。为此东北人民政府工业部于二月底发出了关于生产责任制的决定，其目的就在继续改进旧的生产组织和管理制度，奖励职工的发明创造和合理化建议，以达到全面实行科学的定额管理，使今后的新纪录运动，能够在建立和加强生产责任制与生产纪律的基础上，更周密有计划地开展起来。
