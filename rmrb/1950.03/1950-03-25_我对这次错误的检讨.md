　　My Self-Criticism Regarding This Error
　　Cui Daosheng
　　After these several theft incidents occurred, I did not carefully study the situation, nor did I promptly listen to the opinions of the masses. Based solely on subjective speculation, I illegally inspected Dai Pingzhen, Ma Jinglong, and Old Woman Wu. At the same time, I suspected Comrade Jia without any basis. This was an act of disregarding organizational discipline and the law. Moreover, I delayed reporting the entire process of the matter to the Management Committee, the Trade Union, the Party, and the Youth League until the general meeting, and I did not report to the higher-level administration or the Party. Only when the matter developed uncontrollably did I seek out the organization. This violation of organizational discipline and government laws should be severely punished by the Party, the administration, and the Trade Union.

　　I myself regarded the error of infringing upon human rights as a minor matter. At the first general meeting, I did not make a profound self-criticism nor apologize to the masses. Instead of thanking the masses for providing clues to help solve the case, I treated the solving of the case as our own merit, which made the masses even more dissatisfied. Due to my personal errors, the prestige of the Party, the administration, the Trade Union, and the Youth League among the masses suffered a great loss, making it difficult to promote work, workers' production enthusiasm fluctuated, and production decreased.

　　Why did such errors occur?

　　With the help of superiors and the masses, I realized that after coming here, I did not humbly learn from everyone, did not know how to rely on the workers, and regarded my own class brothers as outsiders. Such distrust of the masses made it impossible to take responsibility for state-owned enterprises. The ideological roots of these errors lie in the fact that I have the "burden" of being an old cadre, using my own brain to replace the Party's policies, and not believing in, let alone relying on, the masses. My class viewpoint is not clear, and I have forgotten a Communist Party member's love and care for their class brothers. The result of my style of work is just as the newspaper said: "Neither relying on the working class to improve production leadership and improve production quality, nor correctly uniting the technical personnel of the factory," which isolated me. Not enough help was given to Party work and underground Party members. For example, instead of actively trying to help branch secretary Comrade Jian You improve his work, I simply issued orders or severely blamed him, which made him even more unsure of what to do. Party meetings became a formality, criticism and self-criticism could not be carried out, and Party work was in a state of stagnation. No Party members have been developed in the past ten months, and the Party, the Youth League, the administration, and the Trade Union have not cooperated well.

　　I sincerely accept the punishment given to me by the Party, the administration, and the Trade Union. I guarantee that I will not make similar mistakes in the future. In my work, I will pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, consult with the masses on matters, put down the "old revolutionary" burden, and strive to learn revolutionary theory and enterprise management. Under everyone's supervision, I will actively do my work well to make up for the losses caused by this error.

　　我对这次错误的检讨
    崔道生
    这几次偷窃事件发生后，我没有细致研讨情况，更没有及时听取群众意见，单凭主观推测，就非法地检查戴聘珍、马景龙与吴老太太，同时也毫无根据的对贾同志怀疑。这是目无组织法纪的行动。而一直拖到开大会时，还未把事情的全部过程向管委会、工会、党、团详细汇报，也没有向上级行政、党汇报。事情发展的不可收拾了才找组织，这种违犯组织纪律，违犯政府法令的错误应该受到党、行政、工会的严厉处分。
    我自己则把侵犯人权的错误看成一件小事，在第一次大会上未做深刻检讨也未向群众道歉，不感谢群众提出线索帮助破案，反而把破案当成我们自己的功劳，致使群众更加不满。由于我个人的错误使党、政、工、团在群众中的威信受到很大损失，使工作不易推动，工人生产情绪波动，生产降低。
    为什么会产生这样的错误呢？
    在上级和群众的帮助下，我认识到我来到这里后没有虚心地向大家学习，不知道依靠工人，把自己的阶级亲兄弟看成了外人，这样不相信群众，对国家企业就不能负起责任。产生这些错误的思想根源在于：我有老资格的“包袱”，用自己的脑子代替党的政策，不相信群众更谈不到依靠群众。我的阶级观点不明确，忘掉了一个共产党员对自己阶级兄弟的热爱与关怀。我这种作风的结果，正像报纸上所说：“既没有依靠工人阶级，改进生产领导和提高生产质量，又没有正确的团结工厂的技术人员”使我孤立起来。对党内工作及地下党员帮助不够，如对支书简友如同志不是积极想办法帮助他把工作提高一步，而只是简单命令或严厉的责备，结果使得他更不知做什么好。党的会议变成了形式，展不开批评与自我批评，使党的工作陷于停顿状态，十个月来没有发展一个党员，党、团、行政、工会也配合不好。
    我诚恳的接受党、行政、工会给我的处分。并保证今后不再犯类似的错误。在工作中注意倾听群众意见，有事多和群众商量，放下“老革命”的包袱，努力学习革命理论和企业管理，在大家监督下，积极把工作做好，以弥补这次错误的损失。
