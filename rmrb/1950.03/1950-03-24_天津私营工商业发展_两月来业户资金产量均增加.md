　　Tianjin Private Industry and Commerce Development
    Businesses See Increased Capital and Output in Two Months
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd – Tianjin's industry and commerce continued to develop in January and February. During this period, 318 private industrial businesses opened, 163 closed, and 124 switched industries; 1,064 commercial businesses opened, 524 closed, and 331 switched industries. The percentage of private businesses with capital of 3,000 or more "real units" (折实单位) among the total number of new businesses increased from 13.6% in November and December of last year to 19.8%. Among them, one egg factory had capital of 150,000 "real units," more than any new business in the past year. The average capital of commercial businesses opening in January and February was 845 "real units" per business, while the highest average in October of last year was only 687 units per business. The percentage of private industrial businesses with powered equipment also increased from 18.3% in November and December of last year to 22.3%. The industries with the most openings were mineral oil refining, electrical equipment, metal smelting, dyeing and weaving, and construction, as well as hardware and import-export businesses. The industries with the most closures or conversions were sock knitting, towel making, soap making, shoe and hat making, laundry and dyeing, bicycle repair, and yarn and cloth wholesalers, general merchandise, and Western medicine dealers. Many soap making, candy, knitting, sauce, and brewing businesses, which switched industries due to overproduction and sluggish sales, converted to mineral oil refining, rubber, milling, and carpet making. The best-performing industries were machinery and metal smelting. For example, statistics from 110 machinery businesses showed that they produced 53 flour milling machines in December of last year, and in January of this year, they produced 54 machines in just 20 days. These businesses also added 589 employees in January and February. The metal smelting industry produced 549 tons of finished products in 20 days in January, and increased production by another 35 tons in 20 days in February. The reason for the development of these industries is the increase in orders and the urgent need in the market since the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition was held last year. Other industries, such as leather and rubber, also continued to develop due to improved sales channels.

　　天津私营工商业发展
    两月来业户资金产量均增加
    【新华社天津二十二日电】天津市工商业一、二月份续有发展。在这期间，私营工业开业三百十八户，歇业一百六十三户，转业一百二十四户；商业开业一千零六十四户，歇业五百二十四户，转业三百三十一户。私营业开业户资金在三千折实单位以上的，由去年十一、二月份占总开业户的百分之十三点六增加到十九点八。其中有一户蛋厂资金达十五万折实单位，较去年一年任何一家开业户的资金都多。商业资金一、二月份开业户每户平均为八百四十五个折实单位，去年开业户最多的十月平均每户只六百八十七个单位。私营工业有动力设备的，也由去年十一、十二月份占总开业户的百分之十八点三增至百分之二十二点三。开业最多的是矿油炼制、电工器材、五金冶制、染织、营造等工业。以及五金、进出口等商业；歇业或转业的多是织袜、手巾、造胰、鞋帽、洗染、自行车修理和纱布内局、百货、西药货栈等行业。因生产过剩产品滞销而转业的造胰、糖果、针织、酱料、酿酒多转营矿物油制炼、橡胶、磨坊、地毯等业。营业最好的工业是机器、五金冶制等业，如机器业一百一十户的生产统计，去年十二月份生产面粉机五十三部，今年一月份仅二十天即生产了五十四部。该业在一、二月份中并增加职工五百八十九人。五金冶制业一月份二十天中铸造成品五百四十九吨，二月份二十天内又增产三十五吨。这些行业发展的原因是自去年天津举行工业展览会后订货增多，市场需要迫切。其他如制革、橡胶等业亦因打开销路而续有发展。
