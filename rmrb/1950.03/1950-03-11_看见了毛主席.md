　　Saw Chairman Mao

　　At 4:00 PM on February 27th, just as the whistle blew at the Harbin Railway Factory signaling the end of the day shift, and day and night shift workers were changing over, a line of cars pulled up in front of the general office building, and many people emerged from the vehicles. Zhang Guangfu, the secretary of the general office branch, came downstairs and immediately recognized some familiar faces. He quickly realized that it was Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou. He turned around and rushed back inside, excitedly and quietly telling everyone, "Chairman Mao is here!"

　　Chairman Mao inspected the forging, mechanical, repair, and locomotive workshops. In each workshop, Chairman Mao warmly shook hands with the workers, and kindly inquired about the conditions of their night shifts. When Chairman Mao shook hands with Wang Hengshun, an elderly worker in his sixties, Old Wang was momentarily speechless. He simply gazed at Chairman Mao's smiling and approachable face, and was moved to tears. Chairman Mao asked him, "How are you?" He looked at Chairman Mao and said, "Good!" After a long pause, he finally squeezed out a sentence he had wanted to say for years: "Chairman Mao, you've worked too hard!" Chairman Mao replied kindly, "We are all the same."

　　When Chairman Mao arrived at the forging workshop, all the workers wanted to gather around and talk to him, but then they thought that they shouldn't leave their machines and delay production in front of their great leader. So they continued production while watching him. Workers in the repair workshop cheered as they welcomed Chairman Mao into the building while continuing their work. Workers in other workshops were both surprised and delighted to hear that Chairman Mao had arrived. As Chairman Mao walked in front of each of them, everyone carefully looked at their great leader.

　　The next morning, the first question workers asked each other was: "Did you see Chairman Mao?" Those who hadn't seen Chairman Mao were eager to find out how tall he was and how his health was. Zhang Guangfu, the secretary of the general office branch, said: "After seeing Chairman Mao, I was so excited I couldn't sleep half the night when I got home." Labor hero Wang Chongwu said: "When I went home, Chairman Mao's image was still spinning in my head." Old worker Wang Hengshun said: "Chairman Mao smiled and shook my hand, my heart felt like it was blossoming. I felt extremely honored."

　　看见了毛主席
    二月二十七日午后四时，哈尔滨铁路工厂下班的汽笛刚响过，日班和晚班的工友正在上下班交替的时候，总事务所门前停了一长串汽车，车中走出好多人。总事务所支部书记张广福从楼上下来，一眼看见几个面孔很熟的人，他敏捷地想到这原来是毛主席和周总理，随即转过身来向屋里飞奔，小声而又惊喜地告诉每一个人：“毛主席来了！”
    毛主席在这里视察了锻冶、机械、修机、机车四个分厂。毛主席每到一个厂都和工人们热烈地握手，亲切地询问工人夜班的工作情形。当毛主席和六十多岁老工人王恒顺握手的时候，老王一时什么也讲不出，只是望着毛主席那微笑可亲的面孔，感动得流出眼泪。毛主席问他：“你好啊？”他两眼望着毛主席说：“好！”，呆了半天，才把他想了几年要说的话挤出来一句：“毛主席呀！你太辛苦了！”毛主席亲切地回答说：“我们都是一样。”
    毛主席到锻冶分厂，全体工人都想围上去仔细谈谈，但又一想，当着自己的伟大领袖面前，不该离开机器耽误生产，于是一边生产一边看着。修机分厂的工人一面生产一面欢呼着迎接毛主席进屋。其他分厂的工人们听说毛主席来了，也是又惊又喜。当毛主席走到他们每人的跟前时，谁都仔细地注视了自己的伟大领袖。
    第二天早晨，工人们见面的头一句话就是：“看见了毛主席没有？”没有看见毛主席的人，都纷纷打听着毛主席有多高，身体健康怎样。事务所支部书记张广福说：“我看到毛主席，回家兴奋得半夜没睡着。”劳动英雄王崇武说：“我回到家去，毛主席的影子还在我脑子里转。”老工友王恒顺说：“毛主席笑着和我握手，我心中真像开了花，感到光荣极了。”
