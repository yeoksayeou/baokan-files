[Reported by this newspaper] The Zhangjiakou branches of the North China Trade Company's Department Store, Coal & Iron, Oil & Grease, and Salt companies are implementing the instructions of the Central Ministry of Trade and the head office to accelerate sales and complete the task of currency recovery, and are currently using various methods to sell goods. Since the beginning of March, these branches have successively inspected their business operations, proving that if commercial cadres overcome conservative thinking, closely integrate with cooperatives, and timely transform working methods, sales and currency recovery tasks will be successful, and urban-rural exchanges will improve. The Oil & Grease Company completed 55% of its monthly target in half a month. The Coal & Iron Company, after the North China Coal & Iron Conference, had a fuller understanding of the new tasks and strengthened organizational work, completing over 60% of its monthly target in half a month. However, the Department Store and Salt Company, due to seriously outdated working methods, failed to transform in time, sitting in the store waiting for business, not actively finding solutions, and making no improvements in business. Coupled with the lack of skill of individual salespersons and bureaucratic style, the completion of tasks was seriously affected. For example, the Department Store only completed 20% of its monthly target in the first half of the month, and the Salt Company only completed slightly over 4.7% in the first half of the month.

To change this situation, further accelerate commodity sales, and complete currency recovery tasks, each company has recently adopted effective measures, universally canceling holidays, extending business hours, adding consignment stores, reducing wholesale limits, actively contacting all parties, and changing working methods. In recent days, sales and currency recovery have begun to improve. The wholesale department of the Department Store has also started retailing. The cumbersome procedures for bank payments and the wholesale department picking up goods have also been eliminated. In particular, internal accounting and storage personnel have been streamlined to replenish the store and add stalls; salespersons are divided into groups of three, with two responsible for taking care of customers and one actively contacting the outside world to expand sales coverage. In addition, a fixed team and two mobile teams were set up in the Zhangjiakou People's Market, carrying groceries and circulating through the streets, significantly increasing sales revenue. On the 15th alone, sales increased by 4 million yuan. In particular, the Zhangbei team transported a large quantity of sugar, cloth, and other groceries to Shangdu for sale, which was warmly welcomed by the local people. The sales revenue on that day reached 8 million yuan, which is 26 times the average daily sales of 300,000 yuan before the 15th. On the 16th, the company sent cadres with samples to Chaikoubao, Wanquan, and other places to actively contact cooperatives, government agencies, and schools. The Datong branch also went to Shuoxian and Daiyue Town to open up sales channels. Each company also re-formulated preferential terms and actively sought solutions. In recent days, sales have become increasingly prosperous.

    大量销货回笼货币
    【本报讯】据三月十九日察哈尔日报消息：华北贸易公司张市百货、煤铁、油脂、盐业分公司，为贯彻中央贸易部及总公司加速销货完成货币回笼任务指示精神，现正用各种方式进行销货。各该分公司自三月上旬起即先后对业务经营进行检查，证明商业干部克服保守思想，密切与合作社结合，适时的转变工作方式方法，推销与回笼任务就会有成绩；城乡交流就会有改善。油脂公司半月完成全月任务的百分之五十五。煤铁公司自华北煤铁会议后，对新任务有较充分的认识，加强了组织工作，半月已完成全月任务百分之六十强。但百货公司、盐业公司由于严重的老一套的工作方法，转变不及时，坐在门市部里等买卖，不主动想办法，业务上无所改进。再加上个别营业员的技术不熟练和机关化作风，就严重的影响了任务的完成。如百货公司上半月只完成全月任务的百分之二十，盐业公司上半月只完成全月任务的百分之四点七强。
    为改变这种情况，进一步加速商品推销，完成回笼任务，各公司最近都采取了有效措施，普遍取消假日，延长营业时间，增设代售店，缩小批发限度额，主动与各方面取得联系，改变工作方式方法，日来推销与回笼情况已见起色。百货公司批发部也开始零售。银行交款，批发部取货的繁杂手续也已取消。特别是精简内部会计、保管人员，充实门市部，增设货摊；营业员分三人一组，两人负责照顾顾客，一人主动与外面取得联系扩大了售货面。另外在张市人民市场设一固定小组，两个流动小组，携带杂货循环街头，卖钱额显著增加。十五日一天，多卖四百万元。特别是张北小组，将大批糖、布等杂货运往商都去卖，受到当地群众热烈欢迎。当天卖钱额即达八百万元，等于十五日以前每天平均卖钱三十万元的二十六倍。十六日该公司又派出干部，带着货样，赴柴沟堡、万全等地主动与合作社、机关、学校进行连系。大同支公司也到朔县、岱岳镇打开销路，各公司并重新拟制优待条件，积极主动想办法，近日推销情况愈益景气。
