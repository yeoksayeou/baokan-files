　　Beijing Public Security Bureau Accepts Workers' Suggestions
    Improves Tricycle Registration Procedures Conducts General Inspection and Makes Self-Criticism
    To the Editor:
    Upon seeing the suggestions from a group of tricycle workers in the West District published in your newspaper's sixth edition on March 10th, proposing "Improvements to Tricycle Registration Procedures," we not only thank those who made the suggestions but also immediately directed the registration team of the Fourth Precinct to conduct inspections and improve the registration procedures. Furthermore, it prompted us to conduct a general inspection of the entire registration work.
    An investigation revealed that the registration team of the Fourth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau interrupted registration from 12:00 PM to 3:30 PM on the 3rd because the enameled factory's tricycle license plates were not meeting the demand. This indeed delayed several tricycle workers; in addition, the personnel of this registration team were police officers drawn from various locations and were not very familiar with the registration work. Some individuals lacked a strong mass viewpoint and had a poor attitude. A self-criticism was made that evening.
    Regarding the proposed improvements, we agree to "set up more windows" and "issue licenses on the same day to vehicles with no problems." In that district, the fastest time to complete all tricycle license procedures is five minutes, with an average of 130 to 140 tricycle licenses issued per day. The registration team in that district has now added one person to write licenses (total of two people) and added one person to sell application forms. Simultaneously, criticism and self-criticism have been launched. Every evening, each person reports on their work to the team leader and criticizes and reviews the work style and efficiency of each member, in order to meet the requirements of the citizens. In addition, the Traffic Management Section of the General Bureau also convened a meeting of the heads of all registration teams in the city on the 12th, deciding to strengthen registration work throughout the city.
    As for the discrepancies between that letter and the facts, we would like to provide some additional clarification here. First, the letter stated: "We arrived at Ma Xiang Alley early in the morning on the 3rd and did not receive an inspection certificate until after noon" (this inspection certificate may refer to the registration application form). In reality, obtaining the application form would not take more than five minutes. Second, "Today (the 4th), we rode our vehicles there again. There were more than thirty people ahead of us, and just as we were about to reach the front, the staff announced 'Only thirty people will be registered today; the rest will have to come back tomorrow.'" In reality, ninety-two license plates were issued that morning, so it would not have been impossible to reach the thirty-third person. A total of one hundred and thirty-eight tricycle licenses were issued that day, and twenty-five license plates were left at the end of the day, so it would not have been possible to register only thirty people.

### 京市公安局接受工人意见  改进三轮车登记手续  进行总检查并作检讨

　　京市公安局接受工人意见
    改进三轮车登记手续  进行总检查并作检讨编辑同志：
    见到三月十日贵报第六版刊登的西区一群三轮车工人提议“改进三轮车登记手续”的意见，我们除感谢这些提意见的人外，立即令内四分局登记组进行检查改进登记手续。此外还引起我们对整个登记工作作了总检查。
    查公安内四分局登记组，三日那天因搪磁厂的三轮车牌供不应需，所以在十二时至三时半这段时间曾中断了登记，实在是耽误了几个三轮车工人的时间；另外这个登记组的人员是由各处抽调来的警士，不太熟习登记工作，个别人员群众观点不够，态度不好，当晚已作了检讨。
    对提议改进的办法，我们同意“多设窗口”“同一天对无问题的车发给牌照”，该区发三轮车牌时快的五分钟即可办完全部手续，平均一天发一百三四十个三轮车牌，现在该区登记组已多加一人写执照（共二人）多加一人卖声请书，同时又展开批评与自我批评。每天晚上每人向组长汇报工作，并批评检讨每个人员的工作作风与工作效率，以求切合市民的要求。此外总局交通管理科也于十二日召集全市各登记组组长会议，决定全市加强登记工作。
    至于那封信与事实有些不符的地方，我们这里附带说明一下。第一该信说：“三日一早到达马相胡同，一直到中午以后才领得一张检验证”（这检验证可能就是登记声请书）。实际上领取声请书最多不会超过五分钟。第二“今天（四日）我们又蹬着车去，前面有三十多个人，排到快近中午的时候工作人员却宣布‘今天只登记三十名，其余的明天再来。”实际上那天上午发了九十二个车牌，不会轮不到第三十几个人。该日共发出三轮车牌一百三十八个，下班时还剩下了二十五个牌子，决不会只登记三十名。
