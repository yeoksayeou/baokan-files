　　"U.S. Economic Mission" Arrives in Vietnam
    Planning to Directly Control the Puppet Bảo Đại
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The "U.S. Economic Mission," formed to implement the invasion plan decided at the Bangkok Conference and led by Griffin, has begun its activities in Vietnam. After arriving in Saigon on the 6th, the mission held discussions with French High Commissioner to Vietnam Pignon, French Commander-in-Chief in Vietnam Carpentier, and the Bảo Đại puppet group. According to the Associated Press, the United States has asked France to consider how to directly provide weapons to the puppet Bảo Đại. However, both Pignon and Carpentier made statements emphasizing that U.S. "aid" should be channeled through France. According to Reuters: Pignon said at a press conference on the 11th, "U.S. aid to France is aid to Indochina, which France is defending." According to the New York Times on the 9th, cited by the U.S. Information Service: Carpentier said in an interview with reporters from the newspaper, "If U.S. aid is given directly to Bảo Đại, I will resign immediately." However, according to a report from the Dongtong Agency in Bangkok on the 15th, Griffin stated on the 14th that U.S. "economic aid" would still be given directly to Bảo Đại. The Associated Press (Washington, 14th) revealed that the United States would propose the establishment of a "Franco-Vietnamese Joint Committee" to receive and use U.S. "aid," with U.S. military observers in the committee. In effect, this is equivalent to direct U.S. control of Bảo Đại.
    The mission left Saigon on the 14th for Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

　　“美国经济使团”抵越
    策划直接控制傀儡保大
    【新华社十九日讯】为执行曼谷会议所决定的侵略计划而组成的“美国经济使团”，在葛里芬率领之下，已首先向越南展开活动。该团于六日抵达西贡后，即与法国驻越南高级专员皮农、法国驻越军总司令加尔庞吉埃以及保大傀儡集团会商。据合众社透露，美国要求法方考虑怎样直接以武器给与傀儡保大的问题。但皮农和加尔庞吉埃都发表谈话，强调美国的“援助”应该通过法国。据路透社消息：皮农十一日在记者招待会上说：“美国对法国的援助，就是对法国正在保卫着的印度支那的援助。”另据美国新闻处引纽约时报九日消息称：加尔庞吉埃在会见该报记者时说：“如果美国的援助直接给与保大，他将立即辞职。”但据电通社曼谷十五日消息，葛里芬在十四日发表的声明中，仍表示美国的“经济援助”将直接给予保大。合众社（华盛顿十四日电）则透露美国将建议成立一个“法越联合委员会”，以接受并使用美国的“援助”，委员会中设美国军事观察员。这在实际上也就是等于美国对保大的直接控制。
    该团已于十四日离西贡前往柬埔寨的百囊奔。
