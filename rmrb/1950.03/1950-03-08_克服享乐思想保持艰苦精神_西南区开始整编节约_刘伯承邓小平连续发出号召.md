　　Overcome Hedonistic Thought, Maintain the Spirit of Hardship
　　Southwest Region Begins Streamlining and Economizing
　　Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping Issue Successive Calls
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing] News: Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Deng Xiaoping, Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, have recently called on party members and cadres in organs and troops to overcome hedonistic thoughts and extravagance, and to continue to maintain the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living, in order to meet the new tasks of 1950. On the 2nd of this month, the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a conference of party member cadres from leading organs stationed in Chongqing, at which Deng Xiaoping gave a report on streamlining and economizing. Deng Xiaoping first listed the hedonistic behaviors of cadres, saying: After entering the city, a special housing allocation committee was organized, but when allocating housing, some heads of units did not start from the needs of cadres, but always wanted to live in a small bungalow themselves. This is a "first me, second the masses" mentality that is detached from the masses. Serious extravagance exists in some organs; some units do not cherish national property and have damaged many electric lights, toilets, water pipes and other furniture, but these phenomena have not yet attracted the serious attention of various organs. Deng Xiaoping particularly pointed out that many organs are also wasting manpower due to unreasonable staffing and work methods. Bringing rural organizational forms and working methods into the city, the staffing is large and complicated, the work is slow and dragging, there are many people eating and few people doing things. He also explained the necessity of streamlining and economizing, saying: Streamlining and economizing is not only to save expenses and overcome financial difficulties, but also to maintain the health of cadres' thinking and prevent corruption. The reason why the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have won the support of the people is also because we can endure hardship. This spirit must continue to be promoted. At the same time, streamlining and economizing is also to make the staffing of organs more reasonable and improve work efficiency; it can also draw some cadres to strengthen rural work. We must learn urban working methods, implement collective office work, tighten housing, and reduce unnecessary expenses. Finally, Deng Xiaoping said: There are still many difficulties and arduous tasks facing us, but as long as we can maintain the glorious tradition of hard work, and seriously review with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the difficulties can be overcome. The Chongqing Xinhua Daily also published an editorial on the 8th, calling on cadres not to be overwhelmed by victory, not to regard themselves as heroes, and to continue to promote a hard-working style and implement streamlining and economizing. Under the leadership of the streamlining committee, various organs are re-drafting staffing plans. At the same time, in studying Deng Xiaoping's report, they are examining and overcoming hedonistic thoughts. They are also discussing ways to save on the use of housing, vehicles, water and electricity.
　　In January of this year, Generals Liu and Deng issued a notice to the troops of the Second Field Army, calling on them to overcome hedonistic thoughts and meet new tasks, pointing out that the majority of cadres in the troops have strict lives and work actively, but some cadres are developing hedonistic thoughts and their morale is lax. The notice pointed out that although the Southwest Liberation War has basically come to an end, the large number of troops who have revolted and surrendered remain to be reformed, the remnant bandits have not yet been wiped out, the broad masses have yet to be mobilized, and the devastated urban and rural production remains to be restored. The troops should bear the main responsibility for these glorious and arduous tasks. We should establish the idea that the combat team is also a work team, and strive to undertake the new tasks of local work. Senior cadres should set an example and overcome the incorrect tendencies that have occurred among cadres after the victory.

　　克服享乐思想保持艰苦精神
    西南区开始整编节约
    刘伯承邓小平连续发出号召
    【新华社讯】重庆消息：人民解放军第二野战军司令员刘伯承、中共中央西南局书记邓小平，最近连续号召机关部队中的党员、干部，克服享乐思想及铺张浪费现象，继续保持艰苦朴素的光荣传统，以迎接一九五○年的新任务。本月二日，中共中央西南局召开驻重庆各领导机关的党员干部大会，由邓小平作有关整编节约的报告。邓小平首先列举干部中的享乐表现说：进入城市后，曾经组织了专门的房屋分配委员会，但在分配住房时，有的单位负责人，不从干部人员的需要出发，而总想自己另外住个小洋房，这是“第一是我，第二是群众”的脱离群众思想。某些机关存在着严重的铺张浪费现象；有的单位不爱护祖国财产，把电灯、马桶、水管和其他家具等损坏不少，而这些现象尚未引起各机关的认真注意。邓小平特别指出：由于编制和工作方式的不合理，许多机关还浪费着人力。把农村的组织形式及工作方法带入城市，编制庞大冗杂，工作拖拖拉拉，吃饭者多，做事者少。并解释整编节约的必要说：整编节约不仅是为了节省开支，克服财政困难，而且可以保持干部思想的健康，防止腐化。共产党和人民解放军之所以得到人民拥护，也因为我们能吃苦耐劳。这种精神必须继续发扬。同时，整编节约也是为了使机关的编制更加合理，提高工作效率；还可抽出一部分干部去加强农村工作。我们必须学会城市的工作方法，实行集体办公，紧缩房屋，减少不必要的开支。最后邓小平说：摆在我们面前的困难还是很多，任务还很艰巨，但只要我们能保持艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，以批评和自我批评的精神去认真检讨，困难是可以克服的。重庆新华日报也于八日为此发表社论，号召干部不要被胜利冲昏头脑，勿以功臣自居，应继续发扬艰苦作风，贯彻执行整编节约。现各机关在整编委员会领导下，正在重拟编制。同时在学习邓小平的报告中，检查及克服享乐思想。并正就使用房屋、车辆、水电等事讨论节约办法。
    今年一月间，刘、邓两将军曾向第二野战军部队发出了克服享乐思想、迎接新任务的通知，指出部队大多数干部生活严整、工作积极，但也有一些干部发展着享乐思想，情绪松懈。通知指出：西南解放战争虽基本上已告结束，但起义和投诚的庞大部队尚待改造，残匪还未肃清，广大群众有待发动，残破的城乡生产尚待恢复。这些光荣而艰巨的任务，部队都应负起主要责任。应树立战斗队同时也是工作队的思想，努力担负起地方工作的新任务。高级干部更应以身作则，以克服胜利后干部中所发生的不正确倾向。
