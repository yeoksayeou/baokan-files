Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 1st (dispatch from TASS, New York, February 28th): The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that the net income of American farmers in 1949 was $13.8 billion, a decrease of 17% compared to 1948 and 22% compared to 1947. Although farmers' net income has fallen, their debt has increased. The Department of Agriculture estimates that so-called secured debt increased from $4.7 billion on January 1, 1946, to $5.4 billion on January 1, 1950. Other debts of farmers at the beginning of this year were also significantly higher than the $2.7 billion at the beginning of 1945. The Department of Agriculture is forced to admit that it expects the situation of farmers this year to deteriorate further. The New York Times correspondent in Washington reported that Department of Agriculture experts predict that farmers' income this year will decrease to around $12 billion. This means a decrease of almost one-third compared to 1947.

　　美国农民愈趋贫困  收入减少债务增加
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社纽约二月二十八日讯：美国农业部估计一九四九年美国农民纯收入为一百三十八亿美元，比一九四八年减少百分之十七，比一九四七年减少百分之二十二。虽然农民纯收入低落了，但债务却增加了。农业部估计所谓有抵押的债务从一九四六年一月一日的四十七亿美元增加到一九五○年一月一日的五十四亿美元。农民的其他债务在本年初也比一九四五年初的二十七亿美元，大为增加。农业部被迫承认，它预料今年农民的情况还要更进一步的恶化。纽约时报驻华盛顿记者报道说：农业部专家们预料，农民今年的收入将减少到一百二十亿美元左右。这就是说，比一九四七年减少几乎三分之一。
