Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance has recently decided to implement a unified salt tax rate method, starting today (March 14th), initially in North China (including Yuncheng), East China, and Central South (Guangdong) regions. Given the varying production costs and prices of salt across China, the Central People's Government Ministry of Finance, to regulate profits and losses, balance the people's burden, and ensure the smooth progress of production and sales according to plan in various regions, has determined salt tax rates based on grain prices, uniformly classified, zoned, and graded by the central government, according to the actual conditions of each salt-producing area. Since this decision was implemented in January 1950, differences in local physical standards and grain prices have led to price discrepancies in salt, mutual offsetting of salt production, and speculation by private merchants. It has been reported that local salt is offsetting sea salt, Lu salt is offsetting Huai salt, and the Northeast is offsetting the interior, greatly affecting this year's production and sales plans and national revenue. Therefore, the ministry specifically instructed the Salt Administration Bureau to discuss specific methods for unifying salt tax rates with the China National Salt Industry Corporation. It has now been decided that the average retail price of standard food grains in six locations, namely Tianjin (30% Beihe millet, 70% Northeast millet), Jinan (millet), Xuzhou (Huaxiaomai wheat), Shanghai (Zhongbai japonica rice), Hangzhou (Zhongbai japonica rice), and Guangzhou (Xue rice), will be used as the calculation standard. Based on the 1950 transportation and sales plan of 26.2 million dan determined at the first National Salt Affairs Conference, the percentage of each rice price is calculated. Tianjin rice price accounts for 31% of the total, Shandong rice price accounts for 10%, Xuzhou wheat price accounts for 15%, Shanghai rice price accounts for 15%, Hangzhou rice price accounts for 12%, and Guangdong rice price accounts for 17%. The unified tax standard physical price is then calculated by multiplying the percentage by the average retail price of the above standard food grains in each region and summing the results. For regions with excessively high costs, such as Yuncheng and Huainan, the calculation will be based on 90% of this unified physical standard price. The above method has been approved by the Central Ministry of Finance and will be implemented from March 14th. The Salt Administration Bureau is responsible for overseeing the implementation and will instruct its subordinates to implement the policy in consultation with the China National Salt Industry Corporation. The adjustment time will be once a week in principle, and adjustments can be made at any time as circumstances change.

　　中央人民政府财政部决定
    实行统一盐税税额办法
    盐税税率以粮价为标准分区计算征收
    【新华社北京十四日电】中央人民政府财政部顷决定自今日（三月十四日）起，实行统一盐税税额办法，并先从华北（包括运城）、华东、中南（广东）三个地区作起。按我国盐的产制成本不一，贵贱相差亦大。中央人民政府财政部为调剂盈亏、平衡民负，借使各地产销均能按照计划顺利进展，曾根据各盐区实际情况，决定盐税税率，以粮为标准，由中央统一分类分区等差核定。此一决定自一九五○年元月开始实行以来，由于各地实物标准和粮价高低不同，以致盐价纷歧，盐产互相冲销，私商钻空投机。据报，近来土盐冲销海盐，芦盐冲销淮盐，东北冲销关内，影响今年产销计划和国家收入很大。为此，该部特责成所属盐务总局商同中国盐业公司研究盐税税额统一具体办法，现已决定：以天津（北河小米百分之三十东北小米百分之七十）、济南（小米）、徐州（花小麦）、上海（中白粳）、杭州（中白粳）、广州（雪米）等六地标准食粮的零售平均价为计算标准，并以首届全国盐务会议确定的一九五○年运销计划二千六百二十万担为基数，从而求出各项米价的百分比，计天津米价占总额百分之三十一，山东米价占百分之十，徐州麦价占百分之十五，上海米价占百分之十五，杭州米价占百分之十二，广东米价占百分之十七。再以百分比分乘各地上述标准食粮的零售平均价，相加总和，即为统一的税额标准实物价。成本过高地区如运城、淮南则按此统一的实物标准价百分之九十计算。上项办法已经中央财政部批准，自三月十四日起实行。由盐务总局负责掌握，并商同中盐公司分别转令所属执行，其调整时间以每星期一次为原则，如遇情况变化，则可随时机动加以调整。
