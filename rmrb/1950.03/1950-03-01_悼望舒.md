　　In Memory of Dai Wangshu
　　Hu Qiaomu

　　The unfortunate news of Mr. Dai Wangshu's death from asthma struck me heavily. I mourn the loss of a talented lyric poet who was determined to serve the people for China.

　　Like many kind-hearted Chinese intellectuals, Wangshu has made great progress in recent years. His temporary cessation of literary activities is but one aspect of this progress. He was determined to change the direction of his past life and creation, and enthusiastically learn new things and participate in new work. Although I only had a few brief conversations with him, his sincerity, humility, simplicity, and proactive approach to work left a deep impression on me. Just three days ago, he was still on his sickbed, talking to me with deep feeling about his current work of translating from French and writing reports for foreign countries. Not many days ago, he also expressed to other comrades that he would apply to join the Chinese Communist Party after his recovery. He was capable of realizing his wish to join the Party, he was capable of doing much beneficial work, and I also believed that he would write new and beautiful poems in the near future. But his youthful life was taken away, and all these possibilities can never be realized… Let the living do more and better work to fill the void left by the dead!

　　悼望舒
    胡乔木
    戴望舒先生因哮喘病逝世的不幸消息，重重地打击了我。我为中国丧失了一个决心为人民服务的有才能的抒情诗人而悲悼。
    像许多纯良的中国智识分子一样，望舒在近年有了很大的进步。他暂时停止了他的文学活动，不过是这个进步的一方面表现。他决心改变他过去的生活和创作的方向，并且热情地学习新的事物，参加新的工作。虽然我只和他谈过几次简短的话，他的诚恳、谦虚、朴素和工作的积极性却留给我深刻的印象。只在三天以前，他还在病榻上和我一往情深地谈着他现在所担任的用法文翻译和写作对国外的报道的工作。不多几天以前，他还向旁的同志表示他在病后将要求加入中国共产党。他是能够实现他入党的愿望的，他是能够做很多有益的工作的，我并且相信，他在不久以后将写出新的美丽的诗章来。但是他的壮年的生命被夺去了，一切这些可能都永远不能实现了……让活着的把工作做得更多更好，来填补死者留下的空白吧！
