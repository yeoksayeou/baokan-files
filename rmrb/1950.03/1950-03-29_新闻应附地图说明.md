　　News Should Include Explanatory Maps
　　·Li Changhou·
　　Editor's Note: Mr. Li Changhou's opinion is correct and very important. Every newspaper should strive to improve in this direction, and newspapers with difficult conditions should also strive to gradually achieve this.

　　Maps are very important in newspapers, and many news items and articles must use maps. Some news and articles are better explained with maps. Because news agencies and newspaper editors should have very detailed maps, they cannot assume that the general reader has very detailed maps.

　　But this point does not seem to have attracted enough attention. For example, the People's Daily published introductions to the administrative divisions of the North China region on January 28th, 29th, and 30th, and the administrative divisions of the Northeast region on February 6th, all of which should have included maps. Some things are clear at a glance when you look at a map, such as location. Explaining with words is laborious and unrewarding, and the most important thing about place names is location. For example, the county seat of Huma County, Heilongjiang Province (merged from Oupu, Mohe, and Huma counties) is probably the old Huma county seat. It's hard to guess the county seat of Xunke County (merged from Wuyun, Qike, and Xunhe counties). At most, you can guess that it is not the old Wuyun county seat. There is also no way to guess the county seat of Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province (merged from Yuanwu and Yangwu counties). Because maps are not usually drawn, printing maps often leads to jokes. For example, the "Map of the Situation of the People's Republic of China" reprinted by Zhu Yulian on page 577 of the third issue of New China Monthly merged Suiyuan Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into the Suiyuan Administrative Region, and still drew Xuzhou, which had been incorporated into Shandong Province, in Jiangsu, which are very careless mistakes. Unexpectedly, such a big mistake passed the eyes of the editors of both the News Daily and New China Monthly. (Editor's Note: This error has been corrected in the "Editor and Reader" column of the fifth issue of New China Monthly.) From this, we can see that we usually pay too little attention to geography. We often see articles introducing the Soviet republics, and I hear many people say, where are these countries? This is the truth. The foreign maps sold in the market are old and simple. Therefore, more illustrations should be inserted when publishing news about the Soviet republics.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 2nd: "The total length of railways in our country is 26,857 kilometers (including Taiwan and Hainan Island), of which 24,794 kilometers were liberated by the end of 1949, and 21,046 kilometers were opened to traffic." This requires a map to illustrate. And the January 30th dispatch: "1950 work plan... the national restoration of trunk and branch lines: a total of 1,074 kilometers and 300 meters. Namely, the Jinzhou to Gubeikou line 505 kilometers and 240 meters; the Bei-Tongpu line, the Pingwang to Xin County section 258 kilometers, the Xiang-Gui-Qian line, the Huaiyuan to Nandan section 50 kilometers, the Zhe-Gan line, the Guixi to Leping branch line 99 kilometers; the Jinpu line, the Shanjialin to Yixian branch line 31 kilometers 310 meters; the Longhai line, the Jinguyuan branch line 32 kilometers 500 meters; the Zhe-Gan Road, the Anyuan branch line 8 kilometers 500 meters; the Yue-Han line, the Zixing branch line 43 kilometers 750 meters; the Jinxi Yangzhangzi branch line 46 kilometers." This also requires a map to illustrate. If no map is attached, some place names must be annotated. If you don't know where that place is, what's the use of just knowing a name?

　　The commonality of place names is relative, and here is a hypothetical standard. Among the maps of China, the most accurate are the "New Map of the Republic of China" (1934) published by the former Shen Bao and the fifth edition of the "New Provincial Map of China" (1948), the former being more detailed and the latter slightly less. It is best to add annotations to place names that are not on the "New Provincial Map of China," and place names that are not on the "New Map of the Republic of China" (priced at twenty-five silver yuan before the war, which ordinary people could not afford) must be annotated. For example, the New Provincial Map does not have Pingwang. According to the New Map, Pingwang is approximately 113 degrees 9 minutes east longitude and 40 degrees 2 minutes north latitude, northeast of Kouquan and southwest of Datong, which is best to note. Neither local map has Shanjialin. From the railway mileage table on page 176 of the New Map, we know that it is 14.19 kilometers east of Lincheng, which requires more annotation. Neither local map has Yangzhangzi, and the editor seems to have an obligation to tell the reader. Also, some branch lines do not specify the starting and ending points. If no map is drawn, it must be explained in words. For example, where exactly does the JInguyuan branch line go from? For changes in administrative regions, the merging of old county seats, and the establishment of new county seats, editors must take the trouble to add explanations to those place names, and so on. We make such a troublesome request to the editor, and we hope that the editor will not be annoyed. If the editor doesn't know where is where, how can the reader know? If the editor doesn't know, he can ask the source of the news. For example, ask the Ministry of Railways for place names on railways, and ask the provincial government for county seats. For many readers, newspapers are educational tools. To complete this task, editors must not be afraid of trouble.

　　In fact, not only place names, but also some people's names and technical terms, editors must take the trouble to annotate, which will not be discussed here.

### 新闻应附地图说明

专栏：报纸述评

　　新闻应附地图说明
    ·李昌后·
    编者按：李昌后先生的意见是对的，而且是很重要的。每一家报纸应努力向这方面改进，条件困难的报纸也应力求逐步办到。
    地图在报纸上是很重要的，有许多消息、文章，一定要用地图。有一些消息、文章，用地图做说明更好。因为通讯社跟报社的编辑人要准备有很详细的地图，却不能假定一般读者有很详细的地图。
    但这一点好像还没有引起充分注意。比方说人民日报一月二十八日、二十九日、三十日，这三天登的华北区行政区划介绍，二月六日登的东北区行政区划，都应该附地图。有些事看图了如指掌，如位置，用文字说明吃力不讨好，而地名最要紧的就是位置。如黑龙江省呼玛县（鸥浦、漠河、呼玛三县合并）县治也许是旧呼玛县治。逊克县（乌云、奇克、逊河三县合并）的县治就很难猜了，最多你可以猜不是旧乌云县治。平原省原阳县（原武，阳武两县合并）的县治也没有法子猜出。因为平常不画地图，一印地图，常常闹出笑话来。如新华月报第三期５７７页转载朱育莲的中华人民共和国形势图把绥远省跟内蒙自治区合并成绥远行政区，把已经并入山东省的徐州依旧画在江苏境内，都是非常粗心的错误。想不到这么大的错误竟通过了新闻日报，新华月报两道编辑的眼光。（编者按：这一错误新华月报第五期“编者与读者”栏中已加以更正。）从这儿可以看出我们平素对地理太不注意。我们常常看到介绍苏联各加盟共和国的文章，我听见好些人说这些国家都在什么地方呢？这是实在的话。市上出售的外国地图，既古旧，又简单。因此，在登载苏联各加盟共和国消息的时候，应该多插图。
    新华社北京一月二日电：“我国铁路总长为（包括台湾、海南岛在内）２６，８５７公里，在一九四九年底已解放者为２４，７９４公里，已通车者为２１，０４６公里。”这需要一张地图来说明。又一月三十日电：“一九五○年工作计划……全国修复干支线：共１，０７４公里３００公尺。计锦州至古北口线５０５公里２４０公尺；北同蒲线平旺至忻县段２５８公里，湘桂黔线怀远南丹间５０公里，浙赣线贵溪至乐平支线９９公里；津浦线山家林至峄县支线３１公里３１０公尺；陇海线金谷园支线３２公里５００公尺；浙赣路安源支线８公里５００公尺；粤汉线资兴支线４３公里７５０公尺；锦西杨杖子支线４６公里。”也需要一张地图来说明。如果不附地图，有些地名非加注解不可。如果不知道那个地方在那儿，光知道一个名儿有什么用？
    地名的常见不常见是相对的，这儿提出一个假定的标准。在中国地图当中，绘制得最精确的要算前申报馆出版的“中华民国”新地图（一九三四年）跟中国分省新图第五版（一九四八年），前者详而后者略。那个地名中国分省新图没有的最好加注解，“中华民国”新地图（战前定价银二十五圆，一般人是买不起的）没有的地名非加注解不可。比方说分省新图没有平旺，查新地图平旺约东经１１３度９分，北纬４０度２分，在口泉东北，大同西南，最好要注一下。山家林两本地图都没有，从新地图１７６页铁路里程表知道在临城东１４．１９公里，就更要加注解了。杨杖子两本地图都没有，编者似乎有告诉读者的义务。还有一点，有些支线并未说明起迄点，如果不画图也得用文字说明。例如金谷园支线究竟从那里到那里？行政区域的变动，旧县治合并，新县治增设，那些地名编者要费功夫加说明，也可依此类推。我们对编者提出这么一个麻烦的要求，希望编者不要讨厌。要是编者都不知道何处在何处，读者又怎么知道呢？编者不知道可以向消息的来源打听，如铁路上地名问铁道部，县治问各该管省政府。对许多读者讲，报纸是教育的工具。要完成这个任务，编者决不能怕麻烦。
    其实不光是地名，有些人名跟专门名词，编者都要费神加注，这儿不谈了。
