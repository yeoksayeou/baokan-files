Title: Letter Content Should Be Specific and Accurate

Editor's Note:

　　Many problems in readers' letters deserve attention and resolution, but they are often written vaguely, without specifying the time, place, and names of people involved in the events. For example, one student wrote a critical opinion about the unreasonable distribution of scholarships, but only said that there were many such situations without giving a single specific instance. Another reader wrote that there were inappropriate phenomena such as forced apportionment of public bonds, but did not write where such situations occurred, making it difficult to believe. Several doctors and nurses wrote that they were dismissed by the hospital under the pretext of implementing an "exchange system," but did not specify whether the hospital was public or private, nor did they explain what the "exchange system" was. These situations make it impossible for us to conduct investigations and understand the facts, thus making it inconvenient to handle the issues. This defeats the purpose of writing a letter. As long as what is written is factual, there is no need to worry. We hope that future letters will include the sender's mailing address and real name so that we can inquire and contact them. (Due to limited newspaper space, for the benefit of the majority, we cannot publish a substitute mailing address for a small problem.) As for what name to use when publishing, it is up to the writer. If the letter writer still has any concerns, the editors will certainly keep it confidential. We will never publish letters of unknown origin or with unconfirmed facts.

### 来信内容要具体确实

　　来信内容要具体确实
    读者来信中有许多值得注意解决的问题，但写得不具体，没有写出事情发生的时间、地点、人名。如有一位同学，写出了对助学金发放不合理的批评意见，但只说是有很多这样的情形，却未举出一个实例。有一位读者来信说，公债有强迫摊派等不应有的现象，但也没有写出到底这样的情形发生在那里，这就使人难以相信。有几位医生护士来信说，他们被院方以实行“交流制”为借口遣散了，但未说明医院是公立还是私立，也未解释什么是“交流制”。这些情形，使我们无法进行调查，不明实情，因之不便处理。这就失去了写信的意义。只要写的是事实，就不必有什么顾虑。希望今后来信都写明通讯地址及真实姓名，以便我们询问与联系。（报纸篇幅有限，为了多数人的利益，是不便为一个小问题登代邮的。）至于要发表时用什么名字，则可听便。写信者如果还有什么顾虑，编者一定为之保守秘密。而对于来历不明，事实不确的信件，我们是决不会发表的。
