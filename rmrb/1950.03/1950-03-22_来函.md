　　Letter to the Editor
    Yesterday, in the news item "Closing of the Second Beijing Municipal Student Congress" issued by the Beijing Municipal News Office (published on yesterday's edition of this paper), the phrase "Representatives Chen Lihua and Chen Yuanfang took the stage for free speeches" was a mistake for "Representatives Li Jian and Chen Lihua..."; "Chairman Gu Qizong" was a mistake for "Chairman Chen Yuanfang."

    昨日本社经京市新闻处所发“京二届学代会闭幕”新闻（刊昨日本版）中“陈丽华、陈元方两代表上台自由讲话”为“李健、陈丽华两代表……”之误；“主席古奇踪”为“主席陈元方”之误。
