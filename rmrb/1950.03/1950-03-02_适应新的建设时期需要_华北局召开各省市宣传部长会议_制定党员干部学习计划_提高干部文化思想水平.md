Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th. The joint conference of propaganda ministers of the CCP committees of provinces and cities in North China, convened by the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was held from the 7th to the 11th of this month. The attendees included deputy ministers of the CCP committees’ propaganda departments from the Inner Mongolia Branch Bureau of the CCP and the five provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Pingyuan, the two centrally-administered municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the provincial-level municipalities of Baoding, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Taiyuan, Guihua, and Baotou, as well as the Minister of Propaganda of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, totaling 39 people. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Panshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau, and was attended and guided by Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting focused on discussing how to adapt to the needs of the new construction period, improve the cadres' level of Marxism-Leninism, and further strengthen the ideological and policy leadership of the Party's propaganda departments; and formulated a study plan for Party member cadres for the next three to five years.

The meeting first discussed how the Party's propaganda departments in the provinces and cities of North China, after the establishment of the cultural and educational institutions of the Central People's Government, should transfer the part of the propaganda work (including bookstores, radio stations, news agencies, etc.) that they had to manage on behalf of the government during the war period to the government for management. The meeting believed that before the establishment of the Central People's Government, it was absolutely necessary for the Party's propaganda departments in North China, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Propaganda Department, to temporarily manage a large part of the cultural and educational work on behalf of governments at all levels, and that this had laid the foundation for the government's cultural and educational work. Now that the cultural and educational departments of the Central People's Government have been established, this part of the work should be transferred to the government for management. According to the experience of some places in the transfer work, if the government deems it necessary, it should also allocate a part of the cadres who are truly capable of the work to the government. During the transition period, it is also necessary to provide the relevant government departments with necessary assistance in a concrete manner, provide as much experience in management work as possible, so that the government's cultural and educational departments can gradually become familiar with the work until they can fully manage it. At the same time, it must be explained to the whole Party that after the work is transferred to the government for management, all instructions and decisions of the government should be respected and resolutely implemented.

Secondly, the meeting reviewed the shortcomings in the Party's propaganda work in North China in the past. The meeting pointed out that there were great shortcomings in the work of ideological leadership and political leadership within the Party in North China. For a long time, the Party's propaganda department has simply carried out propaganda and education on the central work in a "one-size-fits-all" leadership method. Therefore, the propaganda and education work within the Party has not been carried out in a very in-depth manner, and the political and ideological level within the Party has not been raised to the level it should be. Many comrades in the North China Party do not understand or do not understand very well that if the education work within the Party is not strengthened and the level of Marxism-Leninism of Party member cadres is not raised, the Party will not be able to consolidate and improve, and the propaganda work among the masses will be weak and powerless.

The meeting analyzed the situation of the North China Party in propaganda work: Party member cadres are still unfamiliar with or completely ignorant of many issues related to economic construction; the level of awareness of workers in newly liberated cities is not high enough, and farmers after land reform also need to be raised a step further, the vast number of new cadres and retained personnel need to be well united and transformed, and the remnants of the Kuomintang's long-term reactionary propaganda still remain in some intellectuals and other people; at the same time, new things and new problems are constantly emerging in the great revolutionary victory in China and the world. All these situations require not only a large number of propaganda cadres who can master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, understand our economic situation and economic construction policies, and understand the international and domestic situation, but also require us to train a group of cadres with the ability to handle affairs and master technology. However, the theoretical level of our Party's cadres is not high at present, especially a large number of old cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds have not had the opportunity to improve their cultural level, and the 350,000 new Party members absorbed by the provinces in North China in 1949 have a very poor understanding of the Party. Therefore, raising the Party's ideological level and strengthening the ideological front is an urgent issue for the North China Party's propaganda work.

Based on the above situation, the meeting formulated a study plan for Party member cadres in the next few years:

Study Plan for Party Member Cadres in the Next Few Years

(1) Strengthen the education of Party branches and the education of new Party members. It is stipulated that Party classes must be held once every ten days to half a month. Compile systematic teaching materials for branches and systematically teach basic knowledge of the Party. In rural areas, teaching stations and branch instructors should be set up to teach Party members regularly. Party schools of provincial and prefectural committees should train teaching station instructors and branch instructors in a planned way, first ensuring that one person is trained in each district.

(2) Strengthen the education work of Party schools. Each province should establish regular Party schools with a term of more than one year, and transfer the main Party member cadres at the county and district levels to the school for study. The content of the study mainly includes the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism (including the history of social development, political economy, and an overview of Leninism), the Chinese revolution and the Communist Party of China (including New Democracy Theory, the history of the Party, and the Party's general line and general policy) and the Party's current specific policies. In addition, special reports on current affairs and mass movements should be made on a regular basis. Provincial party schools and prefectural committees should also hold short-term training courses to conduct education on the construction policies of New Democracy and the construction of the Party, with a term of generally three months. Strive to give county and district cadres a study opportunity in two or three years. The educational policy of Party schools should take into account both fundamental improvement and the needs of current work.

(3) Continue to strengthen the organization and leadership of on-the-job cadres' study. In addition to the temporary necessary study of current affairs policies, regular theoretical study should be adhered to, and attention should be paid to the appropriate allocation of time between the two. Leading cadres should lead the study and provide necessary explanations and answers to questions. Strict study system. Stipulate the books that should be studied within a year. After each book is studied, a test should be conducted, and those who fail must restudy. Those with too low cultural level and no self-study ability should not participate in theoretical study, and the wrong idea of treating study as a political treatment should be corrected. Reorganize the study organization, and the study content of new cadres and old cadres should be different. Old cadres with self-study ability should study "A Brief History of Social Development," "Political Economy," "Imperialism," and "State and Revolution" among the twelve theoretical books stipulated by the Central Propaganda Department this year, and strive to study "The Foundations of Leninism" and "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder." Old cadres who have a considerable cultural level but lack preliminary theoretical knowledge and cannot study the twelve theoretical books stipulated by the Central Propaganda Department should focus on studying policies and preliminary theoretical books (middle school politics textbooks can be selected). New cadres study "History of Social Development," "Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party of China," "New Democracy Theory," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," "On Nationalism and Internationalism" and current affairs and policies. The study of new cadres should focus on ideological transformation and familiarity with the Party's policies, and establish the concept of serving the people.

(4) Seriously carry out cultural learning within the Party. In addition to transferring old cadres with a true primary school graduation level to worker-peasant rapid middle schools for study, a part of the cadres can also be transferred to prefectural cadre primary schools. Whether entering middle school or primary school, they should abide by the system, complete their studies on time, and not be transferred halfway, and prevent the phenomenon of凑人数 (còu rén shù - making up numbers) when transferring cadres to school. All cadres who cannot be transferred to school should participate in spare-time tutoring. Organs above the county level should organize spare-time cultural schools. Districts that cannot organize spare-time cultural schools should also issue textbooks to organize group learning. Party member cadres who participate in group learning should be instructed to formulate study plans, squeeze time to find tutors, and conduct regular inspections and assessments. For Party members of branches who have not been separated from production, they should be organized or urged to participate in people's schools or night schools in a planned way to learn culture. In order to strive to eliminate illiteracy and semi-illiteracy among cadres in two or three years. Eliminate illiteracy and semi-illiteracy among Party members in four or five years, and enable them to reach the level of primary school graduation. At the same time, strive to universally improve the level of existing cadres with primary school, higher primary school, and junior middle school degrees by one level.

　　适应新的建设时期需要  华北局召开各省市宣传部长会议
    制定党员干部学习计划  提高干部文化思想水平
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中共中央华北局宣传部召开的华北各省市中共党委宣传部长联席会议于本月七日到十一日举行。到会的有中共内蒙分局及山西、河北、察哈尔、绥远、平原五省，北京、天津两中央直属市，保定、唐山、石家庄、新乡、太原、归绥、包头等省直属市的中共党委宣传部正副部长及华北军区政治部宣传部长等共三十九人。会议由华北局宣传部部长张磐石主持，中共中央宣传部部长陆定一亲临指导。会议着重讨论了如何适应新的建设时期的需要，提高干部的马列主义水平，进一步加强党的宣传部门的思想政策领导等问题；并订定了今后三、五年内党员干部的学习计划。
    会议首先讨论了在中央人民政府的文教机构成立之后，华北各省、市党的宣传部门，如何将在过去战争时期不得不代替政府管理的一部分宣传工作（包括书店、广播电台、通讯社等）分别移交政府管理的问题。会议认为，在中央人民政府未成立之前，华北党的宣传部门在党中央和中央宣传部的领导之下，不得不暂时代替各级政府管理一大部分文教工作，这是完全必要的，而且为政府文教工作打下了基础。现在中央人民政府的文教部门既已成立，就应当把这一部分工作移交政府管理。根据某些地方移交的经验，在移交工作时，如政府认为需要，还要分配一部分确能胜任工作的干部给政府。在过渡期间，并须具体地给政府有关部门以必要的帮助，尽量供给管理工作的经验，使政府文教部门能够逐渐熟悉工作，直到能够完全管理为止。同时须向全党说明，在工作移交政府管理之后，应尊重政府的一切指示决定，并坚决执行。
    其次，会议检讨了过去华北党的宣传工作中的缺点。会议指出：华北党内的思想领导和政治领导的工作有很大的不足。长时期以来，党的宣传部以“一揽子”的领导方法单纯地进行关于中心工作的宣传教育，因此对党内的宣传教育工作做得很不深入，使党内政治思想水平未能提高到应有的程度。华北党内许多同志还不了解或不很了解，不加强党内的教育工作，不提高党员干部的马列主义水平，党就无法巩固与提高，在群众中的宣传工作就将软弱无力。
    会议分析了华北党在宣传工作上所处的情况是：党员干部对于经济建设工作仍有很多不熟悉或完全不懂的问题；新解放城市的工人的觉悟程度还不够高，土地改革后的农民也需再提高一步，广大新参加工作的干部和留用人员都需要很好地团结与改造，国民党长期反动宣传的遗毒还残存在一部分知识分子和其他人民群众中；同时全中国和全世界在伟大的革命胜利中，不断地有新的事物和新的问题发生。所有这些情况，不仅要求我们要有一大批能够掌握马列主义和毛泽东思想，了解我们的经济情况与经济建设政策、了解国际、国内时局问题的宣传干部，而且要求我们培养一批具有办事能力和掌握技术的干部。而目前我们党的干部的理论水平还不高，特别是大批工农出身的老干部，文化水平还没有得到提高的机会，一九四九年华北各省吸收的三十五万新党员，对党的认识还很差。因此，提高党的思想水平，加强思想阵线，乃是华北党宣传工作的一个紧急问题。
    会议根据以上情况，制定了今后数年内党员干部的学习计划：
            今后数年内党员干部学习计划
    （一）加强党的支部教育与新党员教育。规定每十天到半月必须上党课一次。编写系统的支部教材，有计划地讲授党的基本知识。农村应设传授站和支部教员，定期给党员讲授。省、地委党校应有计划地训练传授站教员和支部教员，首先做到每区训练一人。
    （二）加强党校教育工作。各省均应设立正规党校，期限为一年以上，抽调县级及区级的主要党员干部入校学习。学习内容主要是马列主义的基本理论（包括社会发展史、政治经济学、列宁主义概论），中国革命与中国共产党（包括新民主主义论、党的历史、党的总路线总政策）及目前党的各项具体政策。此外并按期做时事与群众运动的专题报告。省党校与地委并应举办短期训练班，进行新民主主义的建设政策与党的建设的教育，期限一般为三个月。争取在二、三年内使县、区干部普遍有一次学习机会。党校的教育方针一方面要照顾到从根本上提高，一方面也要照顾到当前工作的需要。
    （三）继续加强组织与领导在职干部的学习。除临时必需的时事政策学习外，还应坚持经常的理论学习，并注意两者在时间上的适当分配。领导干部要领导学习，并作必要的讲解与解答问题。严格学习制度。规定一年内应学的书籍。每本书学完后要进行测验，不及格者必须重学。文化水平过低无自修能力者，不应参加理论学习，纠正把学习当做政治待遇的错误思想。重新调整学习组织，新干部与老干部的学习内容应有区别，有自修能力的老干部应在本年内学完中央宣传部规定的十二本理论书籍中的《社会发展简史》、《政治经济学》、《帝国主义论》、《国家与革命》等书，争取学完《论列宁主义的基础》、《左派幼稚病》。已有相当文化水平但缺乏初步理论知识不能学习中央宣传部规定的十二本理论书籍的老干部，应着重学习政策和初步的理论书籍（可选读中学政治课本）。新干部学习《社会发展史》、《中国革命与中国共产党》、《新民主主义论》、《论人民民主专政》、《论民族主义与国际主义》等书以及时事和政策。新干部的学习，应着重思想改造和熟悉党的政策，确立为人民服务观点。
    （四）认真开展党内的文化学习。除抽调真正有高小毕业程度的老干部入工农速成中学学习外，还可抽出一部分干部参加专区的干部小学。无论入中学或入小学，均应遵守制度，按期完成学业，不能中途抽调，并防止抽调入学干部时凑人数的现象。凡不能抽调入学的干部均应参加业余补习。县以上机关应组织业余文化学校，区级不能组织业余文化学校，亦应发给课本组织小组学习。对于参加小组学习的党员干部，应责成他们制订学习计划，挤时间找人补习，并举行定期检查和考绩。对未脱离生产的支部党员，应有计划地组织或督促他们参加民校或夜校，学习文化。以争取二、三年内，消灭干部中的文盲和半文盲。四、五年内消灭党员中的文盲和半文盲，并使能达到初小毕业的程度。同时争取现有初小、高小及初中程度的干部，普遍提高一级。
