　　[Report from this newspaper] China People's University, marking the direction of a new type of regular university, has been established in Beijing. Over one thousand six hundred and fifty undergraduate students have arrived at the university. Undergraduate departments began preliminary studies after enrollment on March 1st; formal classes officially started on the 13th.

　　On December 16th of last year, the 11th Government Affairs Council meeting of the Central People's Government approved the establishment of China People's University and appointed working cadres from the former North China University, China University of Political Science and Law, and a portion of the North China People's Revolutionary University to be responsible for preparatory matters. Over the past few months, the persons in charge of the university have formulated preliminary academic systems, curriculum and teaching material plans, and educational administrative management methods.

　　The university is currently divided into undergraduate and specialized training classes. Undergraduate departments temporarily include the Department of Economics, Department of Economic Planning, Department of Finance, Credit, and Loans, Department of Trade, Department of Cooperative Societies (all of the above are three-year programs), Department of Factory Management (two-year program), Department of Diplomacy, and Department of Law (both four-year programs). Specialized training classes temporarily include classes in Economic Planning, Finance, Credit, and Loans, Trade, Cooperative Societies, Factory Management, Statistics, Diplomacy, Education, and Law. The study period for each class is temporarily set at six months. An affiliated Russian Language Specialized Training Class is also established, specializing in training Russian translators, a two-year program. From January 28th to February 20th of this year, the undergraduate departments recruited over 1,600 new students in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Hankou, Shenyang, Harbin, Xi'an, and other places. The qualifications for application were: 1. Cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than eight years, possess a cultural level equivalent to junior high school, and are under 35 years of age; 2. Cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years or have participated in relevant business departments in the liberated areas for more than three years, possess a cultural level equivalent to junior high school, and are under 32 years of age; 3. Industrial workers who possess a cultural level equivalent to junior high school, have more than three years of work experience, have no family burdens for the time being, have progressive thoughts and can be developed further, and are between 17 and 32 years of age; 4. Young intellectuals who possess a cultural level of high school graduation or above and progressive thoughts, and are under 27 years of age. Among the new students admitted this year, there are more than 270 cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than eight years (including veteran cadres from the military with 14 years of Party membership); more than 450 cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years; and more than 170 advanced workers (including labor hero Li Fenglian). These individuals have all been recommended by the people's governments at the provincial and municipal levels, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, or relevant business organizations or political organs above the corps level of the People's Liberation Army, and have passed the examination. In addition, there are more than 700 young intellectuals studying at North China University and the University of Political Science and Law. The first phase of the specialized training classes is scheduled to enroll 3,000 students in batches this year (including 1,000 evening school students), and it is expected that more worker and peasant cadres will be admitted. The evening school absorbs Beijing's on-the-job cadres (mainly worker and peasant cadres) to participate in learning.
