　　Directly Supply Daily-Use Goods
    Nationwide Establishment of Supply and Marketing Network
    Fundamental Changes Occur in the Market Laws of Northeast China
    [This Newspaper News] The nationwide network of department stores is gradually being established. Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest have all successively established regional department store companies, and Northwest is also about to be established. Each province in Northeast China has established a provincial company, and the Central South region has established seven branch companies, while Henan Province has established six branch companies.
    [This Newspaper News] According to Hu Xulun, manager of the Northeast General Department Store Company, the department store companies in Northeast China supplied daily necessities worth 7 trillion Northeast currency to urban and rural people in the four months from September to the end of December last year. Department store supply and marketing networks have been generally established in major cities and towns in Northeast China. However, in terms of sales proportion, cotton cloth accounted for two-thirds of the total sales in the past four months, while general merchandise only accounted for one-third. This proportion will be changed this year, with general merchandise to be raised to more than 55% of the sales volume.
    Due to the role of the Northeast State-Owned Department Store Company, fundamental changes have taken place in the laws of the department store market. As usual, prices would definitely rise before the Lunar New Year, but last winter, due to the fact that department store companies in various places were required to sell 70% of their stock of cloth and groceries before the end of the year and held a big price reduction for twenty days, private merchants were unable to drive up prices, thus breaking the past practice of "soaring prices of department stores at the end of the year." Department store branch companies in Jilin, Songjiang, and other provinces have adopted the method of sending department stores to the countryside, directly exchanging the main department store goods for farmers' grain, eliminating the intermediate exploitation suffered by the farmers.

　　直接供应日用百货
    全国建立供销网
    东北市场规律发生根本变化
    【本报讯】全国各地百货网正在逐渐建立中。东北、华北、华东、中南、西南都已先后成立了区百货业公司，西北亦即将成立。东北各省已成立了省公司，中南区已成立了七个分公司，河南省则已成立了六个分公司。
    【本报讯】据东北百货总公司经理胡叙伦谈，东北各地百货公司在去年九月至十二月底的四个月中供给了城乡群众日用品价值达东北币七万亿元，东北各重要市镇均普遍地建立了百货供销网。但在销售的比重上，四个月来纱布占销售总额三分之二，百货只占三分之一；今年将要改变这一比重，在销售量上把百货提高到百分之五十五以上。
    由于东北国营百货公司的作用，使百货市场的规律发生了根本的变化。向例旧历年关，物价必涨，但去冬由于各地百货公司统限于年底以前卖完存布和杂货百分之七十，并大减价二十天，使私商无法哄抬物价，因而打破了过去“年关百货暴涨”的惯例。吉林、松江等省百货分公司，曾采用百货下乡的办法，以主要百货直接交换了农民的粮食，免除了农民所受的中间剥削。
