　　Grain Processing Exceeds Needs in Beijing Municipal Organizations' Production;
    Urgent Need for Unified Leadership to Strengthen Planning
    [Beijing News] Grain processing in the production activities of Beijing municipal organizations lacks unified leadership and develops blindly, resulting in overproduction. According to statistics from November 1949, the daily output of processed grain in Beijing's urban areas was over 793,400 jin of millet flour and corn flour, over 100,170 jin of sorghum rice, over 94,700 jin of millet, over 57,000 jin of rice, and over 64,400 jin of "Fu Di" wheat flour, totaling over 1,110,000 jin. Adding the over 350,000 jin of millet, rice, and other grains imported daily, as well as the daily output of 440,000 jin of bagged flour, the total amounted to approximately 1,900,000 jin. From November of last year to the end of February this year, according to incomplete statistics from the Grain Company and Retail Company, another 176 grain processing machines were added in the city, including 23 by private merchants, 42 by cooperatives, and 111 newly added by organizational production. Assuming an average daily output of 2,000 jin of various grains per machine (the lowest estimate), the current daily output has increased by approximately 350,000 jin compared to November, already exceeding the city's needs. If blind production continues, it will inevitably result in difficulties in obtaining raw materials or losses. (Some organizations engaged in grain processing production are already unable to operate their machines due to losses, such as the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory and the University of Political Science and Law.) However, some organizations are unaware of this situation and still plan to engage in grain processing production, such as a certain military unit that is installing five sorghum rice machines. Therefore, there is an urgent need for unified leadership in the production of all organizations in the city to strengthen planning and overcome blind development.

　　京市机关生产中
    粮食加工超过需要
    亟需统一领导加强计划性
    【北京讯】京市机关生产中的粮食加工缺乏统一领导，盲目发展，使加工粮食生产发生过剩现象。据一九四九年十一月份的统计，京市城区粮食加工日产量小米面、玉米面为七十九万三千四百余斤，高粱米为十万零一千七百余斤，小米为九万四千七百余斤，大米为五万七千余斤，伏地面粉为六万四千余斤，共计一百十一万余斤，加上每日输入的小米、大米等粮食三十五万余斤以及日产的袋粉四十四万余斤，总数约一百九十余万斤。自去年十一月至今年二月底，根据粮食公司、零售公司的不完全统计，本市又增添粮食加工机器一百七十六台，计私商增加二十三台，合作社增添四十二台，机关生产新增一百十一台。每台机器平均日产各种粮食以二千斤计（最低量），则现在的日产量较十一月份约增加三十五万余斤，已超过本市的需要。如再盲目生产，势必造成无法取得原料、或赔钱的结果。（现在已有部分机关搞粮食加工生产因亏本而不能开动机器了，如北京市汽车修理厂、政法大学等）而有些机关不了解这种情况，仍拟搞粮食加工生产，如某部队正在装设五部高粱米机。因此，全市各机关生产亟应有统一领导，以加强计划性，克服盲目发展。
