Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th: The American occupation authorities in Japan have openly decided to release Japanese war criminals in batches to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo: MacArthur issued a public statement on the 7th, announcing that all Japanese war criminals imprisoned in Japan, including Class A war criminals tried at the same time as Tojo, could be released after "swearing an oath" if they had served one-third of their sentence, and those sentenced to life imprisonment only had to serve fifteen years. To this end, the American occupation authorities have established a "Oath Release Committee" composed of three people to begin the work of releasing all war criminals. This measure not only violates the interests of the peaceful people of all countries who suffered from the atrocities of Japanese war criminals during the war but also disregards the judgments made by the Allied military tribunals regarding Japanese war criminals. According to Carpenter, head of the legal group of MacArthur's headquarters, on the 7th: Shigemitsu Mamoru, the wartime Japanese Foreign Minister who was convicted by the Far East International Military Tribunal, is "of course qualified" to apply for release and is a "model prisoner." Hagen, chairman of the "Oath Release Committee," also stated that Japanese war criminals who were sentenced by the Chinese, Dutch, and Allied military commissions in Guam, Manila, Shanghai, Tokyo, Yokohama, and other places and are now serving their sentences in Japan are all qualified to apply for release after taking an oath. According to the United Press, several war criminals are now, or will be within a few months, eligible for release after taking an oath. As early as June 1946, MacArthur began to release Japanese war criminals successively and, on December 25 last year, he arbitrarily decided on a method of "good behavior and reduced crimes," releasing more than 110 Japanese war criminals in less than two months. MacArthur's further announcement of the "Oath Release" method to release all Japanese war criminals ahead of schedule is clearly aimed at making them important assistants to American imperialism in preparing for a new war.

    中国人民坚决抗议！
　　美帝敌视各国和平人民利益
    竟敢全部释放日本战犯
    阴谋用作准备新战争的重要助手
    【新华社北京十一日电】在日本的美国占领当局已公然决定将日本战犯分批全部释放，以加速扶植日本军国主义的复活。据合众社东京讯：麦克阿瑟七日发表公报，宣布所有囚禁在日本的日本战犯，包括与东条同时审判的甲级战犯在内，只要刑期已执行三分之一，被判无期徒刑者只须执行徒刑十五年，均可在“宣誓”后释放。美国占领当局为此已成立一个由三个人组成的“宣誓释放委员会”，着手释放全体战犯工作。这一措施不仅违背战时曾遭受日本战犯荼毒的各国和平人民的利益，并且蔑视盟国军事法庭关于日本战犯所作的判决。据麦克阿瑟总部的法律组组长卡潘特七日称：已被远东国际军事法庭判刑的日本甲级战犯、战时日本外相重光葵“当然有资格”申请释放，而且他是一个“模范犯人”。“宣誓释放委员会”主席哈根亦称：曾被中国、荷兰和盟国军事委员会在关岛、马尼拉、上海、东京、横滨等地判决而现在日本执行徒刑的日本战犯，均有资格申请宣誓释放。据合众社称，有好几个战犯现在或者数月内可于宣誓后释放。按麦克阿瑟早自一九四六年六月起，即陆续释放日本战犯，并于去年十二月二十五日擅自决定“行为良好，减轻罪行”的办法，在不到两个月的时期内，释放了日本战犯一百数十名。麦克阿瑟此次进一步宣布“宣誓释放”的办法提前释放所有的日本战犯，其目的显然是要使他们成为美帝国主义准备新战争的重要助手。
