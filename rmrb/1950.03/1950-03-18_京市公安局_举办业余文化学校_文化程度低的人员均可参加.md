The Beijing Public Security Bureau
    Establishes Amateur Cultural School
    Personnel with Low Levels of Education are Welcome to Participate
    [This Newspaper Reports] The Beijing Public Security Bureau recently received instructions from the Municipal Party Committee regarding the promotion of amateur cultural education to improve the cultural level of staff. After discussion at a bureau affairs meeting, it was decided to establish an amateur cultural school in the near future, and Vice Director Feng Jiping was publicly elected as the principal. The school's curriculum will consist entirely of cultural courses, and all comrades in the Municipal Bureau with low levels of education are welcome to participate in the studies. To accommodate students' levels, both elementary and intermediate classes will be offered initially. The elementary class is for those ranging from illiterate to sixth grade level, with courses in Mandarin, arithmetic, and general knowledge. The intermediate class is for those at the level of a regular junior middle school, with courses in Chinese language and literature, mathematics, physics and chemistry, history and geography, and natural history. In the future, when conditions are ripe and after considerable experience has been gained in this area, senior high school and university classes will be added. Classes will be held for twelve hours per week. The elementary class courses can be completed within two years or a year and a half, and the intermediate class can also shorten the study time in the same manner. The school will hire experienced teachers from the government as full-time instructors, and some comrades from the bureau will serve as part-time instructors, responsible for teaching. To accommodate some comrades who already have a certain level of Mandarin proficiency but lack scientific knowledge, students can simultaneously take courses in both the elementary and intermediate classes. Upon graduation, students will receive diplomas equivalent to those of formal primary and junior middle schools. The schools in the General Office and Divisions One, Three, and Five will open soon, with more than 900 people registered to take the entrance placement exams.
    [Also Reported] The Beijing Public Security Bureau Amateur Cultural School held its entrance placement exams at the General Bureau on the evenings of the 12th and 13th of this month. A total of more than 900 people took the exams. The exam subjects were Chinese language and literature and mathematics. The grading of the papers has now begun, and classes will begin as soon as the grading is completed.

　　京市公安局
    举办业余文化学校
    文化程度低的人员均可参加
    【本报讯】京市公安局于最近接到市委关于推行业余文化教育，提高工作人员文化水平的指示，经局务会议讨论后，决定于最近期间成立业余文化学校，并公推冯基平副局长为校长。该校学习内容将全部为文化课程，凡市局文化程度低的同志，均得参加学习。为适应学员水平，先举办初级与中级两班：初级班程度为由文盲到小学六年级，课程定为国语、算术及常识；中级班为普通初级中学程度，课程定为国文、数学、理化、史地、博物等。将来待条件成熟，即在这方面有相当经验后，将续办高中班及大学班。每周上课按十二小时进行学习，初级班课程可在二年或一年半以内学完，中级班亦可同样缩短学习时间。该校将由政府聘请有教学经验的人为专任教员，另外由本局部分同志作兼任教员，负责教授。为照顾部分已具有一定国文程度但缺乏科学知识的同志，各学员得同时选修初级班及中级班之课程。学员学习毕业后将领到与一切正式小学、初级中学同等效力之文凭。办公室及一、三、五处的学校最近即将开学，有九百余人登记参加入学编班考试。
    【又讯】京市公安局业余文化学校已于本月十二、十三两日晚在总局举行入学编级考试。应试人员共九百余名。考试科目为国文及数学。现已开始评阅试卷，一俟评判完了，即分班开课。
