　　The National Organizational Work Conference of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League closed on the 27th after lasting a week. The main agenda of this conference was: (1) Correctly developing the League's organization and leveraging the League's role; (2) the allocation and training of cadres; (3) strengthening the League's branch work.

　　Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, gave a report on organizational work at the conference. He pointed out: Since the first National Congress of the Youth League in April of last year, the number of League members has grown from 190,000 to more than 1.5 million, becoming the fighting core of the broad masses of young people in various practical works. Regarding the development of the League, he pointed out that attention should be paid to both quantity and quality, opposing both closed-doorism and formalism; and appropriately grasping the focus and speed of the League's development, so that the League's development work is adapted to the level of consciousness of the young masses and the allocation of cadres. He specifically pointed out that this year, land reform will be implemented in the newly liberated areas with a population of 150 million, and the organization of the Youth League should actively cooperate with this great movement. In addition, he explained that the Youth League is the assistant and reserve force of the Communist Party, and it must unreservedly guarantee the Party's complete leadership over the League, and at the same time, establish and strengthen the Youth League's own system of leadership.

　　Yang Wen, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, gave a report on the work of the Youth League's cadres at the conference. He first pointed out that the allocation, training, and cultivation of cadres of the Youth League have made great achievements in the past year. As of the end of December last year, there were 23,774 Youth League cadres nationwide who were separated from production, an increase of about eleven times compared with the time of the first National Congress of the Youth League in April of last year; however, the existing cadres cannot yet meet the development needs of the Youth League's work. Regarding the cadre work in the coming year, he said: the main tasks are to train and promote cadres, train and cultivate a large number of new cadres and improve in-service cadres in a planned way, train and promote worker cadres, send intellectual cadres to the countryside, and strive to eliminate illiteracy among Youth League cadres within two or three years; at the same time, pay attention to cultivating the fine work style of young cadres and strengthening the unity between young cadres of worker-peasant origin and those of intellectual origin. Finally, he put forward the requirements and plans for cadre work from now until May of next year. In addition, the heads of the Youth League Central Committee's Youth Workers Department, Youth Peasants Department, and Students Department reported on the interim work outlines for the League branches in factories, rural areas, and schools, respectively. Zhang Fan, the Education Director of the Central Youth League School, reported on the experience of training cadres, and the representatives from Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Lushun-Dalian, Shanxi, Henan, Guanzhong, Jiaodong and the army introduced their work experience.

　　Finally, Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, gave a concluding report. He said: Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party, the work of the Youth League has made great achievements in the past year, proving that the resolution of the CPC Central Committee on building the League and the resolution of the first National Congress of the Youth League are completely correct. However, due to the rapid development of the current revolutionary situation and the rapid improvement of the consciousness of the broad masses of young people, in order to welcome the greater development of the Youth League and give play to the greater role of the Youth League, it is necessary to improve the level of work and leadership. In addition to making a brief explanation on how to develop the organization of the Youth League and how to leverage the role of the Youth League, he emphasized the importance of internal education of the Youth League, and required to quickly replenish the propaganda and education institutions of the Youth League Central Committee and the Youth League committees at all levels, and pay attention to cultivating cadres for propaganda and education work. He pointed out: To carry out the work of the Youth League, it is necessary to proceed from reality, to expand the organization of the Youth League, leverage the role of the Youth League, and strengthen the unity and connection between the Youth League and the broad masses of young people from various works, struggles, and movements. Therefore, the Youth League committees at all levels must face the branches, strengthen the leadership of the branches, improve the branch work and life, so that the branches become the core of leading the Youth League members to unite the masses in performing tasks. Feng Wenbin finally encouraged the representatives attending the meeting to learn modestly.

　　After the meeting, the representatives held various symposiums to study issues such as the organizational form of the urban Youth League committees, the work of building the League in the newly liberated areas, the work of building the League in the army, the propaganda and education work within the League, cadre training, and the work regulations of the organization departments of the Youth League committees at all levels.

　　中国新民主主义青年团
    全国组织工作会议闭幕
    讨论发展组织扩大团的作用等问题
    冯文彬号召
    提高工作和领导的水平加强团与广大青年联系
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国新民主主义青年团全国组织工作会议，历时一周，已于二十七日闭幕。此次会议的主要议程为：（一）正确地发展团的组织及发挥团的作用问题；（二）干部的配备与训练问题；（三）加强团的支部工作问题。
    青年团中央副书记蒋南翔在会议中曾作了关于组织工作的报告。他指出：青年团自去年四月全国第一次代表大会迄今，团员人数已由十九万人发展到一百五十万人以上，已成为各种实际工作中广大青年的战斗核心。关于团的发展问题，他指出应注意数量与质量，既要反对关门主义，也要反对形式主义；并要适当地掌握团的发展重点与发展速度，使团的发展工作与青年群众的觉悟程度与干部的配备情况相适应。他特别指出，今年将在一万万五千万人口的新区实行土地改革，青年团的组织要主动地配合这一伟大运动。此外，他还说明青年团是共产党的助手和后备军，要无保留的保证党对团的完全领导，同时，也要建立并加强青年团本身的系统领导。
    青年团中央组织部副部长杨文在会议中作了关于青年团干部工作的报告，他首先指出：一年来青年团干部的配备、训练与培养工作，有很大的成绩。截至去年十二月底止，全国已有脱离生产的青年团工作干部二三七七四人，较去年四月青年团全国第一次代表大会时，增加约十一倍；但现有的干部还不能适应青年团工作的发展需要。对今后一年中干部工作，他说：主要是培养与提拔干部，有计划地大量训练、培养新干部与提高在职干部，培养提拔工人干部，输送知识分子干部下乡，以及争取在两三年内扫除青年团干部中的文盲；同时，注意培养青年干部的优良作风与加强工农出身的与知识分子出身的青年干部之间的团结。最后，他提出了从现在到明年五月期间的干部工作的要求与计划。此外，青年团中央青工部、青农部、学生部负责人曾分别报告工厂、农村、学校团支部暂行工作纲要，中央团校教育长张凡报告训练干部的经验，以及北京、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大、山西、河南、关中、胶东与部队的代表介绍工作经验。
    会议最后由团中央书记冯文彬作总结报告。他说：一年来青年团的工作在共产党的领导与帮助下，有很大的成绩，证明中共中央建团决议和青年团全国第一次代表大会的决议是完全正确的。但是，由于目前革命形势的迅速开展，广大青年觉悟的迅速提高，为了迎接青年团的更大发展与发挥青年团的更大作用，必须把工作和领导水平提高一步。他除了对如何发展青年团的组织及如何发挥青年团的作用作了简要说明外，并强调青年团内部教育的重要性，要求迅即充实青年团中央与各级团委的宣传教育机构，注意培养宣传教育工作的干部。他指出：进行青年团的工作，要从实际出发，要从各种工作、斗争与运动中壮大青年团的组织，发挥青年团的作用，加强青年团与广大青年群众的团结与联系。因此各级团委必须面向支部，加强对支部的领导，健全支部工作与生活，使支部在执行任务时成为领导青年团员团结群众的核心。冯文彬最后勉励到会代表要虚心学习。
    会议结束后，代表分别举行各种座谈会，研究城市团委的组织形式、新区建团工作、部队建团工作、团内宣传教育工作、干部训练及各级团委组织部工作条例等问题。
