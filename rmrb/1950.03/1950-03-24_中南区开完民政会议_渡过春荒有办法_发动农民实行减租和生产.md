Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st: The first Civil Affairs Work Conference of the Central South District, convened by the Civil Affairs Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, concluded on the 17th of this month after nine days. More than 20 people attended the meeting, including heads of civil affairs departments from the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and the two cities of Wuhan and Guangzhou, as well as heads of units such as the Central South District Veterans Management Bureau. The meeting first reported and discussed the disaster relief issues in various parts of the Central South District. The meeting believed that although the winter famine period in the Central South region had been overcome under the leadership of the People's Government in organizing disaster-stricken people to carry out production for self-salvation and work-for-relief, the current spring famine has arrived, and the disaster situation has expanded compared to before, affecting six provinces. In the severely affected areas, phenomena such as selling children, selling livestock and farm implements, and abandoning homes to flee famine, even to the point of death from hunger and disease, have occurred. The local despots in the countryside are taking this opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, plotting to instigate riots, and attempting to divert the focus of the peasants' struggle. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize and lead the masses in various places to wage a resolute struggle against the famine and to crack down on the sabotage conspiracies of the destructive elements. The meeting believed that disaster relief must be combined with mobilizing the peasant masses to carry out rent reduction, and vigorously lead peasants in production for self-salvation. Specific measures include: rent reduction; clearing public property, temple property, and stored grain; carrying out social mutual aid, calling for free lending with borrowing and repayment, and promoting "relatives helping relatives, neighbors helping neighbors"; conducting fundraising for disaster relief in cities and non-disaster areas; work-for-relief, carrying out dike repairs or other construction projects; organizing disaster victims to assist the government in transporting grain; promoting a mass movement of saving and disaster relief among Party, government, military, civilians, and the masses, opposing waste; organizing sideline production according to local conditions; calling for planting more early-maturing crops to shorten the spring famine; and using relief grain with a focus. The meeting believed that if the above specific measures can be properly applied, it is entirely possible to overcome the famine and ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing production. In addition, the meeting also discussed issues related to people's representative conferences at all levels, as well as work related to veterans, preferential treatment for families of martyrs, and the use and allocation of civil affairs funds.

　　中南区开完民政会议
    渡过春荒有办法
    发动农民实行减租和生产
    【新华社汉口二十一日电】中南军政委员会民政部召开的中南区首届民政工作会议，历时九天，已于本月十七日结束。出席会议的有河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东五省和武汉、广州两市民政部门以及中南区荣军管理总局等各单位负责人共二十余人。会议首先汇报并讨论了中南区各地的救灾问题。会议认为，中南全区的冬荒时期，虽已在人民政府领导灾区群众进行生产自救和以工代赈下渡过，但目前春荒又已到来，灾情已较前扩大，受灾地区波及六省。较重的灾区中已发生卖儿鬻女、卖牲口农具和弃家逃荒以至饿、病致死等现象。农村中的恶霸分子遂乘此时机进行造谣破坏，阴谋鼓动暴乱，企图转移农民斗争目标。因此必须发动和领导各地群众，和灾荒作坚决的斗争，并打击破坏分子的捣乱阴谋。会议认为：救灾必须和发动农民群众进行减租相结合，并大力领导农民生产自救。具体的办法是减租；清理公产、庙产、积谷；进行社会互济，号召自由借贷，有借有还，提倡“亲帮亲、邻帮邻”；在城市和非灾区中进行劝募救灾；以工代赈，进行修堤或其它建设事业；组织灾民协助政府调运粮食；提倡党政军民及群众性的节约救灾运动，反对浪费；因地制宜，组织副业生产；号召多种早熟作物，缩短春荒；有重点地使用救济粮。会议认为：以上具体办法只要能运用确当，是完全可以战胜灾荒，并保证春耕生产顺利进行的。此外，会议还讨论了有关各界人民代表会议的问题，以及荣军工作、优属工作、民政事业费的使用与分配等。
