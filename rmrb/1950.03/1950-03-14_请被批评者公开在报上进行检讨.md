　　Requesting Those Criticized to Publicly Conduct Self-Criticism in the Newspaper
　　(I) Requesting Erring Personnel from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, and Both Institutions to Publicly Conduct Self-Criticism in the Newspaper

        Comrades Editors:
    Having read in the People's Daily on March 2nd the report that leading cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, due to their bureaucratic work style, caused severe waste of state assets; followed by the report on March 4th about the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway investigating serious corruption and waste at certain stations and sections, as well as the frequent occurrence of accidents due to negligence, which also resulted in huge losses of state assets. Upon learning of these matters, we were greatly alarmed, discovering that our sense of responsibility to the nation was insufficient. The leadership and the newspapers are calling on everyone daily to strive for thrift and increase production, yet we tolerate these "hard-working" bureaucrats in such wanton waste of the people's fatherland's property. How can this be allowed? If this continues, won't our workers' production movement be in vain? Fortunately, you informed us in a timely manner and spoke on behalf of us, saying what the people wanted to say. This has already caused a good reaction. However, if these serious errors that have already occurred are simply published in the newspaper and then considered finished, we believe it is inappropriate, and the people will not agree! Although some places are already investigating, who knows whether those who have made mistakes are willing to clearly express their willingness to correct them or not? Have they corrected them? What specific measures have been taken to correct them? How are they being corrected? Like last year when the People's Daily published the Pangjiapu Mine incident, the relevant parties publicly conducted self-criticism and responded in the newspaper, determined to correct and indeed corrected them afterward, we were satisfied. After these two incidents were published recently, we said: Let's wait and see the self-criticism of the comrades who have been criticized. However, we have waited and waited, for almost ten days, and there is still no follow-up. Comrades of the newspaper, what is going on? If we do not see a guarantee of self-criticism from the relevant parties and concrete measures to prevent errors from recurring, but only empty words saying "has been rectified and corrected" or "is being supervised and handled," we are not reassured. We request the newspaper and the relevant parties being criticized to answer our questions.

  (II) Requesting the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee and the Puyang and Liaocheng Prefectural Party Committees to Publicly Conduct Self-Criticism

        Mr. Editor:
    Having seen the People's Daily of the 9th and 11th, which published the errors committed by the Puyang and Liaocheng Prefectures of Pingyuan Province in the grain transportation work, this matter is extremely serious. Such bureaucracy can be said to be heartless. What everyone is satisfied with is that the newspaper exposed these errors. During the Kuomintang's rule, such things were everywhere, but the Kuomintang newspapers did not publish a single word, and the people suffered losses and deserved bad luck. In the new China, this is only an unfortunate incident occurring in individual places, and after it happened, the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau immediately ordered a prompt review and handling, and the people's newspapers immediately publicly exposed it, without embellishment or concealment, which is truly a new style and new atmosphere. Regarding this matter, we also hope that the relevant parties in Pingyuan Province will publicly conduct self-criticism in the newspaper. Such public self-criticism can only make the people respect them more and love the People's Government and the Communist Party more.
    I wonder what the editor thinks?
  Regards,
        Wang Dafu, Liu Weixin

  (III) Has it been "Improved"?
        Mr. Editor:
    The "People's Forum" on March 9th published "Telephone Bureau Work Needs to Be Improved" (Editor's Note: The Telecommunications Bureau has already responded to this criticism in this newspaper on the 13th). On March 10th, it published "Suggestions for Improving Tricycle Registration Procedures." I wonder if it has been "improved" now? Or is the "suggestion" incorrect?

  Editor's Note
    The opinions raised by the previous readers are worthy of our great attention. Our attitude towards news reporting is truthful, serious, and responsible. Our publishing of news exposing errors does not mean that our responsibility is over. No, the newspaper must be responsible to the Party, the government, and the people to the end. The criticized party also has the responsibility to respond promptly to news reports, reader letters, etc., published in the newspaper that are critical and suggestive in nature.
    The resolution of the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1919 regarding newspapers included the following item: "One of the most important tasks of the Party and Soviet newspapers is to expose various criminal acts of personnel and institutions, and to point out the errors and shortcomings of Party and Soviet organizations, all of which must be pointed out in a serious, realistic, and comradely tone. The personnel and institutions whose actions are mentioned in the newspaper must, within the shortest possible time, provide a realistic correction or indicate the correction of shortcomings and errors in the same newspaper; without such correction and acknowledgement, the revolutionary court will prosecute the personnel and institutions indicated." We should learn the spirit of this resolution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In September 1942, the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau's decision on the work of the Liberation Daily also included the following item: "If the Party organizations or individual Party members in various places are criticized in the Liberation Daily, they should, within the shortest possible period, make a responsible reply in this newspaper with a realistic attitude. If the criticism is true, they should explain the reasons for the occurrence of the pointed-out shortcomings and errors, and how to correct them; otherwise, the criticized organization or individual will be subject to Party discipline." When the Yan'an Liberation Daily published this decision, it pointed out that this was not only aimed at the phenomenon of neglecting Party newspapers in various places in the Northwest at that time, but this decision had great significance for the whole country.
    Now, we have separately urged the relevant parties to conduct self-criticism and publicly respond! Since our newspaper is the ears, eyes, and voice of the people, we have the responsibility to expose errors until they publicly accept criticism and truly and thoroughly correct them. We hope that the broad masses of readers will closely connect with us, strengthen their concern and supervision of various tasks, and ensure the success of our cause in all aspects.
        Editor, 11th

### 请被批评者公开在报上进行检讨

　　请被批评者公开在报上进行检讨
  （一）请石景山钢铁厂京绥铁路及两机关犯错误人员公开在报上
        进行自我批评编辑同志：
    在三月二号人民日报上读到了石景山钢铁厂领导干部因为有官僚主义作风而使国家资财遭受严重浪费的报道；接着在三月四号的报上又看到了京绥铁路检查某些站段严重贪污浪费、责任事故屡次发生，因之也使国家资财遭受巨大损失的报道。当我们知道了这些事情的时候，引起我们极大的警惕，发现自己对国家的责任感是不够的，领导上和报纸上每天在号召大家力求节约，增加生产，可是，我们却容忍这些“辛辛苦苦”的官僚主义者如此地糟踏浪费人民祖国的财产。这怎么得了？长此以往，我们工人的生产运动岂不要落一场空？幸亏你们及时告诉了我们，而且代表我们说了人民要说的话。这已经引起很好反响。不过，已经发生的这些严重错误，如果只是在报上登一下就算完了，我们认为不妥当的，人民都不会答应的！虽然有的地方已在检查，但谁知道那些犯错误的人们到底肯明白表示改正不肯？改正了没有？有什么具体办法改正？如何改正的？像去年人民日报上登出了庞家堡矿场事件以后，有关方面公开在报上检讨答复，决心改正而且以后也确实改正了，我们是满意的。最近这两桩事情发表了以后，我们就说：等着看受到批评的同志的自我批评吧。可是，等了又等，快十来天了，还是不见下文。报社的同志们，这是怎么回事呀？如果看不到有关方面的检讨和防止错误再发生的具体办法作保证，只是空洞地说“已整顿纠正”“正予督导处理”，我们是不放心的。我们要求报社方面和被批评的有关方面答复我们的疑问。

  （二）请平原省委及濮阳聊城两专区地委公开检讨编辑先生：
    看到九号、十一号的人民日报，上面登的有平原省濮阳、聊城两专区在运粮工作中所犯的错误，这件事情大极了。这种官僚主义可以说是毫无心肝的。大家满意的是报纸揭发了这些错误，在国民党统治的时候，这样的事遍地皆是，而国民党的报纸却一字不登，人民受了损失活该倒霉。在新中国里，这不过是个别地方发生的不幸事件，而且发生之后中共中央华北局立即令迅速检讨处理，人民的报纸上立即公开揭露，毫不粉饰隐讳，是真正一种新作风新气象。对这事，我们也希望平原省有关方面在报上公开检讨一下。这种公开的检讨，只能使人民更敬重他们，更热爱人民政府和共产党。
    不知编辑同志认为如何？
  敬礼
        王大福、刘维新
  （三）“改进”了没有编辑先生：
    “人民园地”三月九日登了“电话局工作要改进”（编者按：电信局对此批评已在十三日本报作了答复）三月十日登了“建议改进三轮车登记手续”，不知现在到底“改进”了没有？或者是“建议”得不对呢？读者  一平
  编者的话
    前面几位读者所提的意见，是值得我们十分重视的。我们对新闻报道的态度是真实、严肃、认真负责的。我们发表了揭发错误的消息，并不等于我们的责任已经完结了，不是的，报纸对于党、对于政府和人民都是要负责到底的。在被批评的方面，也有责任对报纸上所登载的批评与建议性质的新闻报道、读者来信等及时予以答复。
    一九一九年三月联共党八次大会关于报纸的决议中有这么一项：“党和苏维埃报纸最重要的任务之一，就是揭露在职人员和机关的各种犯罪行为，指出党和苏维埃组织的错误和缺点，所有这些必须以严正的实事求是的和同志的语调指出它。被报纸上说到其行动的人员和机关必须在最短时期内，在同一报纸上加以实事求是的更正或指明关于缺点与错误之更正；如果没有这种更正和承认，革命法庭即控诉被指明的人员和机关。”联共的这一条决定的精神，我们是应该学习的。一九四二年九月，中共中央西北局关于解放日报工作的决定中也有这么一条：“各地党的组织，或党员个人，如受到解放日报上的批评时，均应于最短期间内以实事求是的态度，在这个报上作负责的答复，如果批评属实，则应说明所指缺点与错误发生的原因，及应如何改正的办法，否则，该被批评的组织或个人，将要受到党纪的制裁。”当延安解放日报刊载这个决定的时候就曾指出，这不仅是针对着当时西北各地忽视党报的现象而发，在全国来说，这一决定都有很大的意义。
    现在，我们已经分别督促有关方面进行检讨和公开答复！我们的报纸既然是人民大众的耳目喉舌，我们就有责任揭发错误，直至其公开接受批评，真正彻底改正错误为止。我们希望广大读者同我们密切连系，加强对各种工作的关心与监督，保证我们的事业在各方面的成功。
