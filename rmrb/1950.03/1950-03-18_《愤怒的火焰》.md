　　*The Flame of Wrath*
    *The Flame of Wrath* is a film depicting the heroic and resourceful struggle of the Byelorussian people's hero, Zaslonov, against the enemy in the early stages of the Soviet Patriotic War. Under the sacred task of defending Moscow, with the permission of the Party Central Committee, he went to the German-occupied area as a "traitor" to the motherland to carry out a two-faced struggle—ostensibly serving the German invaders, but actually directing the sabotage activities of underground party members and guerrillas.

    This film immediately gives the audience a tense and thrilling mood from the beginning, and it is not until the end that people can deeply breathe a sigh of relief. But this is not like Hollywood movies, begging for legendary, mythical stories to attract the audience and deceive the audience, but based on the selfless spirit of dedicating oneself to the motherland and the people, and the expression of the highest peak of the Bolshevik's unique courage and wisdom, carrying out a highly revolutionary and artistic struggle against the enemy.

    *The Flame of Wrath* demonstrates a highly artistic form of struggle, and people can deeply appreciate the political cultivation of the great Soviet people and learn their conscious patriotism. This film is too rich in educational significance for us, and every revolutionary worker should see it. (Ya)

　　《愤怒的火焰》
    《愤怒的火焰》是描写苏联的爱国战争初期，白俄罗斯人民英雄扎斯洛诺夫英勇机智对敌斗争的一部影片。在保卫莫斯科的神圣任务下，他得到党中央的允许，以祖国的“叛徒”的面貌，到德寇占领区去作两面斗争——表面上替德寇服务，实际上指导地下党员、游击队员们的破坏活动。
    这影片，一开始即给观众以紧张、惊险的情绪，一直到剧终才使人深深地吐一口气。但这并不是如好莱坞的影片一样，乞灵于传奇、神话式的故事以吸引观众，欺骗观众，而是基于为祖国、为人民而献身的神圣任务的忘我精神，和布尔塞维克特有的英勇和智慧的最高峰的表现，对敌人进行高度的革命艺术的斗争。
    《愤怒的火焰》表现了高度艺术的斗争形式，人们可以深刻地体会到伟大的苏联人民的政治修养，学习他们的自觉的爱国精神。这影片给我们的教育意义又太丰富了，每个革命工作者都应当去看。（亚）
