Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi and other provinces are issuing large amounts of agricultural loans to actively help farmers prepare for spring plowing. Loan uses include the supply of seeds, farm tools, and water conservancy projects.

　　The Hebei Provincial People's Bank branch had already distributed agricultural loan tasks to various special districts and counties in January, requiring all localities to make full use of agricultural loans to prepare 6.52 million jin of barley and spring wheat seeds for disaster areas, and lend 21.9 million jin of fertilizer to non-disaster areas. In addition, special loans were issued for water conservancy, livestock, and agricultural implements according to the different needs of each region. The branch also instructed all sub-branches to prepare seeds and fertilizers as early as possible to ensure timely sowing of early-maturing crops. The branch has sent more than ten cadres to Tianjin, Tangshan, Tongxian, Baoding and other special districts for inspection. According to statistics as of February 3, seven special districts have prepared more than 30 million jin of fertilizer (various oil cakes) and 4.177 million jin of barley and spring wheat seeds. Among them, Cangxian and Dingxian special districts are also transferring wheat seeds to various counties and districts. Some places in Baoding Special District have transported wheat seeds to the disaster-stricken villages. Jinghai County has also distributed wheat seeds to various concentration points, ready for timely distribution. Other severely affected areas such as Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Fengnan are also actively transferring supplies, and Qingxian has begun distribution. Various places that are not ready are also vigorously preparing so that seeds and fertilizers can be lent to farmers as soon as possible to ensure timely sowing of early-maturing crops and shorten the spring famine.

　　The Chahar Provincial People's Bank branch this year issued 27 million jin of rice in agricultural loans, of which 2 million jin was for agricultural implements, and has been allocated to Chahar South, Yanbei, and Chahar North special districts. In January, the provincial branch used more than 1.2 million jin of rice recovered from old agricultural loans to purchase 45,000 pieces of agricultural implements through the supply and marketing cooperatives in Chahar South, which were loaned or sold to farmers. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the three special district cooperatives have formulated a specific plan to supply 86,500 pieces of spring plowing agricultural implements before the end of March, and the Provincial General Cooperative has ordered 20,000 plowshares from Shanxi, which will be shipped back by the end of February. In addition, in order to help farmers universally implement seed soaking, the Provincial People's Government loaned 3 million jin of grain to sign a contract with the Chahar Provincial Wine Industry Monopoly Company for 280,000 jin of alcohol, which is now being shipped successively. One million jin of fertilizer for spring plowing in various places has also been distributed to Xuanhua, Wei County, Zhuolu and other six counties in Chahar South. In addition, pesticides purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative from Hankou, recently 6,000 to 7,000 jin of tin stone will be shipped back.

　　Shanxi will issue 9.4 million jin of millet in agricultural loans this year. Water conservancy loans are scheduled to be fully issued by the end of April, and will focus on solving the problems of small and medium-sized river channels and waterwheel repairs. Livestock loans will be issued in mid-April through state-owned livestock institutions and specialized breeding cooperatives, breeding stations, and breeding centers organized by farmers who jointly invest in raising breeding females, in order to massively breed livestock. Agricultural implement loans will focus on supporting blacksmiths and carpenters in manufacturing and organizing transportation, supplemented by helping direct purchases. This loan will be completed by the end of March. All agricultural loans in Shanxi Province can be gradually issued to villages by various counties at the beginning of this month.
