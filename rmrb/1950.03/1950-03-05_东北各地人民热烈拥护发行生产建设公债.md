Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: People in various parts of Northeast China are enthusiastically supporting the issuance of the 1950 Northeast Production and Construction Real Value Bonds, and a wave of subscription enthusiasm is brewing. The Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee convened its third consultative meeting a few days ago, specifically to discuss the issue of promoting bonds. The meeting decided that Shenyang would first underwrite 4.25 million shares, accounting for about one-quarter of the total amount of bonds issued in the first phase this year. The city's bond promotion mobilization committee and its subordinate propaganda committee have been established and have begun their work. Workers and staff of various factories and institutions throughout the city have responded to the government's call and are actively subscribing. Employees of all departments of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and staff and cadres of the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Bureau have voluntarily subscribed. All the workers of the Shenyang Woolen Mill, which won the first-class model award for promoting bonds in Shenyang last year, wrote a letter to Mayor Zhu Qiwu a few days ago, expressing their determination to tighten their belts, buy more bonds, and maintain their model honor. Heads of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Mechanical Iron Industry Association have made speeches, expressing their willingness to buy more bonds and mobilize their colleagues to promote them vigorously. The city's propaganda week activities for bond promotion, which began on the 25th of last month, are being actively carried out. Changchun City has established a bond promotion mobilization committee, and people from all walks of life have expressed their willingness to promote the spirit of patriotism, buy more bonds, and help the country develop economic construction; the industrial and commercial circles have also held special forums for representatives of various industries to mobilize them. The Fourth People's Representative Conference of Anshan City unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the Northeast People's Government, requesting it to quickly assign the city the task of purchasing bonds, in order to complete the task victoriously and strive to exceed it. At the fourth meeting of the Harbin Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, members from the workers, farmers, culture, education, and industrial and commercial sectors unanimously expressed their determination to work hard to complete the promotion task. The Songjiang Provincial Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League called on all members of the league and progressive youth in the province to play a promoting role in subscribing to bonds. Staff members of the Songjiang Provincial and Harbin Municipal People's Governments have also expressed their willingness to save money from their monthly salaries to purchase bonds. From the fact that the industrial and commercial circles of Harbin began to receive rewards for principal and interest payments in the first year of last year's bonds, they have a deeper understanding of the policies of the People's Government and have expressed their willingness to subscribe. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government has issued special instructions, calling on all cities, counties, and banners to take immediate action to carry out promotion and mobilization work. The provincial and Qiqihar city construction bond promotion mobilization committees have also been established. Qiqihar also held the third People's Representative Conference, which passed resolutions on bond allocation methods and promotion steps. The Liaoxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Youth Work Committee, and other organizations have issued written statements, calling on workers, youth, and women throughout the province to launch a wave of bond subscription and promotion. The Lüda Administrative Office convened a temporary enlarged joint conference of government and people a few days ago, which unanimously adopted the task of striving to complete and exceed 550,000 shares in the entire Lüda area.
