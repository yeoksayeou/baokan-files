　　Democratic Appraisal of Industrial and Commercial Taxes in Beijing
　　Most Appraisals Completed · Many Businesses Pay in Advance
    [Our Dispatch] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Following the announcement that industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1949 in Beijing would be levied starting April 1st, under the leadership of the Tax Bureau, the business scores of most industries have been adjusted and appraised based on the industrial and commercial tax scores of the first half of last year and the actual business conditions of each industry. After the Clock and Watch industry under the First Branch Bureau completed its business score appraisal, it formulated an agreement and issued payment notices as early as the 28th. Upon receiving the payment notices, Yu Jingsheng, the group leader of Guansheng Watch Store, and Qiao Yueting, the deputy group leader of Hengdali Watch Store, took the lead by voluntarily paying 1,869,000 yuan and 1,218,000 yuan in taxes, respectively. Under their mobilization and call, Shenchang Watch Store, one of the largest businesses in the group, immediately paid more than 30 million yuan in taxes to the People's Bank upon receiving the notice. The Dongya Restaurant, within the jurisdiction of the bureau, received the payment notice on the evening of the 27th and paid the full amount of 2,394,000 yuan by 9 am on the 28th. The actions of these stores in preparing tax payments in advance and actively paying them demonstrate their further understanding of the people's government's tax policies, which is worthy of emulation by other industrial and commercial operators.
  Appraisal of Business Scores Strives for Fairness · Businesses Recognize Taxes Are Not Heavy
    In the appraisal of business scores, efforts have been made to achieve fairness and reasonableness as much as possible, and the general feedback from industrial and commercial businesses is good. The Rice and Flour industry held its first appraisal committee meeting on the 24th. Everyone agreed that the industry's appraisal work had a good foundation in the past, and only individual adjustments were needed this time. Regarding the overall business score reduction of 2%, it was decided to avoid the tendency of across-the-board reductions and exemptions, focusing on taking care of struggling households with poor business. Chang Zijiu, the chairman of the industry association, called on his colleagues at the meeting to actively pay taxes and strive to get the tax payments into the treasury as soon as possible. He said: "Some people can't understand it. Whenever taxes are mentioned, they always want to pay less. In fact, if you check the books, everyone knows how much they should pay. Today's taxes are not heavy; before liberation, the unjust money spent inside and outside the sleeves was much more than this." After the meeting, the industry's appraisal work was largely completed with the assistance of the branch bureau's cadres. The total business score of the Cotton industry increased by 400 points this time. The burden on general small and medium-sized households in the industry was reasonable in the past, and the regional distribution was also balanced. Only a few households that also operated kerosene and larger ginning factories bore fewer points. Therefore, it was decided to allocate the newly added points to the twelve large households that had a lighter burden last time. The industry's scoring work has been successfully resolved.
    The various industries within the jurisdiction of the Sixth Branch Bureau have completed the adjustment of business scores. The various industries have generally maintained their original business scores; at the same time, they have also focused on adjusting some of the unbalanced burdens in the past. For example, the business scores determined for the Grain Stores industry in the past were high, and business in the second half of last year was not good, so this time they were readjusted. The industries within the jurisdiction of the First Branch Bureau, except for the New Medicine industry and 15 other industries that still need to be appraised by the industry, and hospitals and clinics that will be appraised later, the remaining 117 industries, totaling 3,872 households, have been separately adjusted and appraised; and payment notices for industries such as eyeglasses, gold jewelry, jewelry, and clocks and watches have been issued one after another since the 26th. In addition to Guansheng Watch Store and two other households that have taken the lead in paying, the five groups of the clock and watch industry, totaling 69 households, guarantee that they will pay all taxes into the treasury within April 3rd.
    When paying industrial and commercial taxes for the first half of last year, individual households in the Traditional Chinese Medicine industry complained that the burden was too heavy. After in-depth investigation, it was found that it was not heavy. This time, the total score of the industry increased by 3%. Liu Yifeng, the director of the industry association, said: "Last year, I said the burden was heavy, which was too subjective." The industry held an appraisal committee meeting on the 24th. In addition to taking care of households in difficulty and phenomena of excessive burden, the newly added business scores were quickly allocated, so that the appraisal work was successfully completed on the same evening. In addition, the Bathhouse and Automobile industries have also completed the appraisal and adjustment of business scores.
  A Few Illegal Merchants' Bribery Attempts Exposed
    Due to the improved awareness of general merchants, during the meeting and appraisal, most groups no longer simply complained or remained silent, but boldly discussed how to achieve a fair and reasonable burden. For example, the manager of Yong'an Pharmacy in the Traditional Chinese Medicine industry, who used to be the director of the industry association, had a lower score last year. Everyone was embarrassed to speak up, but this time someone proposed to increase it by 100 points. Another example is Yong Shenghe, which was found to have fabricated false accounts last time. After realizing that "fraud" is no longer feasible today, it voluntarily increased its score by 150 points during the scoring. However, there are still a few illegal merchants who attempted to reduce their burden during the appraisal of business scores and vainly hoped to use despicable bribery to buy off cadres. It has now been discovered that Liang Delin, the manager of Dongsheng Rice, Grain, and Grocery Store in the jurisdiction of the Eighth Branch Bureau, concealed the opening date and claimed that he had suffered losses in the second half of last year, attempting to avoid increasing his score. After Comrade Chen En of the Tax Bureau conducted an in-depth investigation and exposed him, Liang Delin not only did not repent but also left a package of gifts at Chen En's home on the evening of the scoring day (25th), hoping to achieve the purpose of reducing his score. Chen En returned the original item and attached a letter to educate him. Chen En's clean and honest work style is worthy of praise, and every tax cadre should be vigilant to avoid being exploited by unscrupulous merchants.

　　自报公议公平合理分配分数
    京市民主评议工商税
    大部已评完·不少商户提前缴纳
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：京市一九四九年下半年度工商业税，自宣布于四月一日开征后，在税务局的领导下，大多数行业的业分，已根据去年上半年度工商业税的分数及各该业实际的营业情况，调整、评议完竣。第一分局所属的钟表业在评完了业分后，经过酝酿协议便提早于二十八日发出了纳款通知书，该业组长冠生表行俞京生、副组长亨大利表行乔悦亭在接到缴款通知书的当时，自动带头分别将应纳税款一百八十六万九千元及一百二十一万八千元缴纳了。在他们的动员号召下，该业组内最大商号之一的慎昌表行，在接到通知书后，立即将应纳税款三千多万元向人民银行缴纳入库。该局所辖范围内的东亚饭店在二十七日晚接到缴款通知书，二十八日早上九时，也把应纳税款二百三十九万四千元全数缴清。这几个商店提前预备税款并踊跃缴纳的行为，说明他们对于人民政府的税收政策已有了进一步的认识，值得其他的工商业者学习。
  评议业分力求公平  商户认识税并不重
    各行业在评议业分中，已尽可能的作到了公平合理，一般工商业户的反映良好。米面粮业在二十四日召开了首次评议委员会，大家一致认为该业的评议工作过去已有很好的基础，此次只需进行个别调整。对于总业分应减低百分之二，则决定应避免平均减免的倾向，重点放在照顾生意不好的困难户。该业公会主任委员常子久在会上号召同业积极缴款，争取早日使税款入库。他说：“有些人思想搞不通，一提纳税，总想少纳一点。其实用账本核算一下，谁都明白谁应纳多少。今天的税并不重；解放前，袖里袖外花的冤枉钱比这多得多。”会后该业评议工作，在分局干部的协助下已大体完成。棉花业这次的总业分增加了四百分。该业一般中小户过去的负担合理，区域间也平衡，只有几家兼营煤油及规模较大的轧花工厂负担的分数较少。因此决定新增加的分数分配给上次负担较轻的十二家大户。该业评分工作已圆满解决。
    第六分局所辖范围内各行业已完成了业分的调整，各行业大致维持了原来的业分；同时也着重地调整了过去某些负担不平衡的现象。如粮栈业过去评定的业分高，去年下半年营业又不好，这次就重新调整了。第一分局所辖范围内各行业，除新药业等十六业尚须经过行业评议，医院诊所暂缓评议外，其余一百一十七业共三千八百七十二户，均已分别调整评议完竣；并已于二十六日以后陆续开出眼镜、金饰、珠宝、钟表等行业的缴款通知书。钟表业除冠生行等三户已带头缴纳外，该业五个组共六十九户，保证于四月三日内将全部税款纳库。
    国药业在缴纳去年上半年度工商业税时，个别户叫喊负担过重，经深入调查，发现并不重。此次该业总分数增加了百分之三，该业公会理事长刘一峰说：“去年我说负担重，实在太主观了。”该业在二十四日召开了评议委员会，除对困难户及畸重畸轻的现象分别照顾调整外，新增加的业分也很快就分配好了，使得评议工作在当日晚就顺利完成。此外业分已评议调整完的尚有浴堂及汽车两业。
  有少数不法商人贿赂行为被揭破
    由于一般商人的认识提高了一步，在开会评议时，多数的小组已不再是一味诉苦，或者相对无言，而是大胆地议论怎样才能作到负担的公平合理。如国药业永安堂经理曾任公会理事长，去年评分较低，大家爱面子，不好意思说话，这次便有人提议增加了一百分。又如永盛合上次私造假账被查出后，已经认识到“作假”在今天已吃不开了，便在评分时，自动地增加了一百五十分。但仍有少数不法商人，在评议业分时，企图减轻负担，并妄想利用卑鄙的贿赂手段以收买干部。现已发现的有八分局辖区内的东生米粮杂货店，该店经理梁德林隐瞒开业日期，借口去年下半年经营亏本，企图避免增加分数。经税局陈恩同志深入调查，予以揭破后，梁德林不但不痛改前非，并于评分的当日晚（二十五）到陈恩家中，将礼物一包留给家人，希望达到减分的目的。陈恩将原物退还，并附信一封予以教育。陈恩此种廉洁的作风值得表扬，每个税务干部都应提高警惕，才不致为奸商所利用。
