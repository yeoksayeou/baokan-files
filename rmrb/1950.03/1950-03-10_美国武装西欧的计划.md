　　The American Plan to Arm Western Europe
    By Yermashov, translated by Wang Gengsheng

    Truman's message to the U.S. Congress on the "State of the Union" and on the budget for the fiscal year 1950-51 presents two sides of a picture—but certainly not a beautiful picture of the actual situation in the United States. Every thoughtful American who reads this message cannot help but ask himself: If everything is so smooth, then why are things so bad? If the overall situation is really as good as Truman says, why is there a new, huge military budget? Why impose this new, huge burden of non-productive expenses on the American people? Americans who might ask such questions—and there are hundreds of thousands of them—need only think for a moment to find the answer: Truman's fabricated optimism is entirely based on the hope of maintaining America's vast military machine, and the only way to make new money is to prepare for war as much as possible.

    In the budget message, Truman said it was an "honest budget." But this budget maker has a very strange idea of "honesty." Because the basic idea of the entire budget is to prepare for another world war, and to prepare as many other countries as possible for war, in order to guarantee the excess profits of American monopoly capitalists.

    This explains why the U.S. government plans to spend $30 billion, or 71 percent of the total budget, in the fiscal year 1950-51 on its own armed forces, on the policy of organizing military aggression blocs, and on arming countries participating in this bloc, while spending less than 1 percent of the budget on education and less than 1 percent on public health.

    In the current fiscal year 1949-50, U.S. military expenditures, including the cost of implementing its aggressive foreign policy, are estimated by some authorities to total $25 billion. In previous years, the numbers were smaller. The continuous increase in expenditures for armed forces and the implementation of aggressive foreign policies (Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and military assistance to U.S. satellite countries in Europe, etc.) is being accelerated by the impending economic crisis. Now the American economy is feeling the ominous signs of an impending economic collapse, and therefore, the emphasis is placed on the "military aid to Europe" plan.

    The Marshall Plan, which aims to help American monopoly capital control Western European countries, has had disastrous consequences for these countries. The devastating impact of American "charity" on Western European countries can be seen most clearly from the situation in France. Before the Second World War, French industrial production accounted for 5.4 percent of the total industrial output of capitalist countries at that time. Her industry occupied a prominent position in the world capitalist economy. She accounted for 7.6 percent of the total imports of capitalist countries and 6 percent of the total exports. In the world market, France was able to compete victoriously with other countries, even with the United States.

    What goals did the makers of the Marshall Plan have for France? They hoped to squeeze out her competitive position in industry, to interfere in her colonies, and finally, to organize her within the strategic system formed by the United States to establish its world hegemony. This goal has been largely achieved: the French economy is mired in a quagmire; unemployment is increasing; her industrial output in mid-1949 was still far below the production level of 1929, and a new depression is about to occur; her agriculture is also in a very dilapidated state;—under the pressure of Wall Street, France is forced to import wheat, sugar, and other foodstuffs from the United States. Before the Second World War, goods imported from the United States accounted for only 15.5 percent of France's total imports, but by 1948, this figure had increased to 28 percent. On the other hand, goods exported to the United States accounted for only 3.6 percent of total exports.

    As a result, there is a huge import surplus in foreign trade (115 billion francs in 1946, 133 billion francs in 1947, 225 billion francs in 1948, and 155 billion francs in the first eight months of 1949), inflation, three devaluations of the franc in a row, and a reduction in gold reserves. Gold reserves at the end of 1938 were 2.43 billion U.S. dollars, while in July 1949, only 523 million U.S. dollars remained. The Marshall Plan has caused France's budget to have long-term and huge deficits, huge national debts (foreign and domestic debts), a sharp decline in real wages, and the impoverishment of her working people; at the same time, the profits of monopoly capitalists' companies connected with Wall Street have increased more than 27 times compared with 1938.

    The miserable situation in France caused by the Marshall Plan is typical of all Western European countries that have received the "aid" from the United States.

    In contrast to the dilapidated scenes in Western European countries, monopoly capitalists are making profits as if "feasting during an epidemic." These profits mainly come from the sharp increase in the wholesale prices, especially the retail prices, of consumer goods, including food—most of which are imported under the U.S. "aid" plan.

    The Marshall Plan, which was once boasted as a panacea for treating post-war economic ills, has proven to be a shameful failure. This was predictable, because it is merely a tool for politically and economically enslaving Western Europe, making Western Europe subordinate to American monopoly capitalists, a tool for militarizing the economies of Western European countries, and dragging these countries into military aggression blocs. The United States uses the Marshall Plan as a means to force Marshallized countries to engage in an arms race and increase their military expenditures.

    It was the Marshall Plan that created the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, allowing American troops to be stationed in Britain, Greece, Turkey, and other Marshallized countries. Under the guise of helping to rebuild ports, railways, airports, warehouses, and other bases, battlefields are prepared and strategic materials are stored according to American plans.

    Recent reports have pointed out that strategic materials are being transported under the pretext of economic aid in accordance with the Marshall Plan. Moreover, the military organs established to implement this plan are also operating under the guise of "economic cooperation." All these situations prove that one of the main purposes of the Marshall Plan is to fully militarize the Western European economy.

    When the Marshall Plan had obviously failed and the American economic crisis was imminent, the North Atlantic Treaty was concluded.

    The North Atlantic Treaty was once said to be an instrument of peace to the general public. We only need to recall how U.S. Secretary of State Acheson eloquently declared when the treaty was signed in Washington on April 4, 1949: "This treaty is a guide for those seeking peace to a shelter and a source of strength, a most agreeable assistance in overcoming difficulties." British Bevin was even more hypocritical than his American partner, saying: "Today is not only the day of signing the treaty, but also the day of sacred thought—I dare say it is a day dedicated to the cause of peace."

    But no sooner had the words faded than the initiators of the aggression bloc began to speak in a completely different tone. Immediately following on April 8, Acheson announced: "Supplying free, friendly countries with arms and equipment is in the best interests of the American people (should read: American monopoly capitalists)."

    Maximizing the expansion of military production and obtaining huge profits by delivering weapons and equipment is the secret weapon that Wall Street attempts to use to subdue the "devil" of economic crisis. At the same time, it is also the means by which American monopoly capitalists hope to open up the borders of Western European countries. The main task undertaken by the United States is to supply its vassal states with weapons. The main task of the European vassal states is to build a huge land army equipped with American weapons. This is the fundamental idea of the United States regarding the North Atlantic Treaty, and it is also the fundamental idea of the United States regarding the militarization of Western Europe.

    This point was made very clear by General Bradley—the actual leader of the American army—who led a visit by American army and naval generals to Europe in July and August last year. This general can be justifiably included in the archetype of people described by Gogol in "Dead Souls," "If not familiar with the smoke of gunpowder, at least familiar with the smoke of tobacco." Their belligerent ambitions are boundless, but, it should be noted, they always hope that others will fight for them.

    Before going to Europe, General Bradley delivered a speech to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in which he outlined the "sound strategic concept" of the United States. In short, he said that enough cannon fodder can be found in Western Europe.

    The general's argument is this: The total population of the European countries that have joined the North Atlantic Treaty exceeds 150 million. When their soldiers obtain weapons, they can "defend any defensive stronghold in Western Europe." Bradley does not hide the fact that the American militarists' endorsement of the famous "Military Assistance Program" is based on this "basic principle."

    Indeed, the American "sound strategic concept" is not at all welcomed in Europe. The Manchester Guardian said: The Americans are trying to buy the supreme strategic command of the European army with a mere one billion U.S. dollars; at that time, the disagreements between the United States and Britain caused the London Daily Mail to speak of the danger of a "Cold War across the Atlantic" occurring between Britain and the United States.

    But Washington continues to insist on its "concept" and does what it wants. The reason it insists in this way is very obvious. The military expenditure of the United States itself has increased so rapidly that it can only expand to a certain limit. Therefore, Western Europe must be turned into its military supply tail, and the European army must be turned into its consumers. The United States is forcing its vassal states to expand their armies to the maximum extent. Because this kills three birds with one stone: strengthening American control over Marshallized countries, expanding the military organization under U.S. command, and expanding the market for military supplies—this is the main item of American industrial exports today.

    Now that the North Atlantic Treaty has added new chains to the necks of Western European countries, this is no longer a temporary transaction of profitable military supplies, but a militarization of Western European economic and political life according to the American plan.

    The countries of the North Atlantic Alliance can only obtain the "military assistance" promised by the United States on the condition that they individually conclude bilateral agreements with the United States. Negotiations between Britain and the United States to conclude a bilateral agreement were held in Washington on January 9 this year, and negotiations between other North Atlantic allies and the United States to conclude bilateral agreements will also be held successively.

    These negotiations were preceded by many consultations in Washington, London, and Paris—mainly of a military nature. In particular, the U.S. delegation requested the abolition of the Western European Union Military Standing Committee and the transfer of the command of the aggression bloc entirely to the United States. According to Brussels' "Frontier News," U.S. military authorities hope that the overall command of the strategy of the North Atlantic allies will be exercised by Washington, and representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty Defense Committee will be sent to the general staff of each allied country to coordinate the military actions of each country.

    It is very clear that this attempt by the United States is not only to seize the command of this bloc, but also to ensure that the huge money-making plan for the militarization of the entire Western Europe is beneficial to American monopoly capitalists.

    Despite the arbitrary statements by American politicians that American security is threatened, there is no reason for such an expansion of armaments. These people intend to move the borders of the United States to the Elbe River.

    Some leaders in the United States do not even think it necessary to conceal the motives for America's eagerness for military preparations. For example, General Eisenhower declared on September 20, 1949, before the House Armed Services Committee: "The United States can rule the world when it is united." The phrase "rule the world" correctly explains the purpose of American monopoly capitalists to militarize Europe.

    The goal of the "Military Assistance Program" is far greater than what can be judged from its first appropriation. In the 1950-51 budget, this appropriation is 1.359 billion U.S. dollars, which is only a small part of the total expenditure of the basic plan to carry out conspiracies against world peace and security. The "Military Assistance Program" guarantees the continuous increase in the military expenditures of the United States' European "allies," which will be a source of treasure for American imperialism, and may not dry up or become smaller. Wall Street is unwilling to support its vassal states. On the contrary, it attempts to strip them of their last shirts. Because only in this way can the realization of the plan for the militarization of Europe be guaranteed; and this can enable American monopoly capitalists to obtain huge excess profits.

    In order to fulfill their obligations, the North Atlantic allies are constantly increasing their military expenditures, mainly to purchase American weapons, or to organize domestic military production and the production of parts for these weapons. The following figures show the increase in the military expenditures (calculated in U.S. dollars) of Marshallized countries in 1948-49 compared with 1938-39: Britain increased from 1.4 billion to 3 billion, or an increase of 114 percent; France increased from 800 million to 1.5 billion, or an increase of 88 percent; the Pyrenees Peninsula countries increased from 350 million to 1 billion, or an increase of 186 percent; the Scandinavian Peninsula countries increased from 100 million to 500 million, or an increase of 400 percent. The increase in these military expenditures has filled the entire economic life of these countries with disasters and is one of the main reasons for financial bankruptcy and the impoverishment of the working people. But the authorities of Marshallized countries, spurred on by Washington, continue to increase military expenditures.

    The militarization plan is proceeding at the greatest speed. General Bradley explained what the American "sound strategic concept" means. He said that the United States relies more than ever on the expansion of the land forces of its allies. Wall Street wants to increase the burden on Marshallized countries. Washington's unfortunate allies had the opportunity to see this at the meeting of the chiefs of staff of the North Atlantic Treaty countries in Paris in late November and early December last year, and the subsequent meeting of defense ministers. At these meetings, military issues were discussed most frankly and in the most detailed way. For example, one of the issues discussed was the deployment of troops in the North Atlantic bloc, and which defense line, the Rhine River defense line or the Elbe River defense line, would be more advantageous? According to many reports in foreign newspapers, it can be seen that the subject discussed at the meeting was the American "defense plan," or rather, the American war plan. The representatives attending the meeting had to agree with this plan and accept it without reservation. Details, of course, are kept secret, but some resolutions have been made public. In early January this year, Western European and American newspapers published reports saying that the "joint military plan" had been approved by the military committee of the North Atlantic bloc. This was passed on January 6. According to the Associated Press, the heavy burden in the early stages of the war will be "borne by the French army." As for the U.S. and British troops, the following is stipulated:

    "The occupying forces of the U.S. and Britain in West Germany, along with the troops of the Netherlands and Belgium, will also be combined into a common Western European army."

    Recently, many Western European and American newspapers have reported on what tasks the United States plans to give to the Western European countries controlled by Wall Street. For example, the French Weekly in Paris said: Bradley plans to rearm West Germany and establish a huge West German army led by Nazi generals, and will also arm an Italian army.

    The recent official discussions between the United States and Britain on appeasing Franco, so that Spanish fascism can be fully utilized in the military plans of the Anglo-American bloc, is a noteworthy event. It is generally believed that, in addition to spending 10 billion U.S. dollars to establish U.S. bases in Spain, the Anglo-American invaders will expand Franco's army to 2 million people.

    Sweden, in form, is still not a member of the North Atlantic bloc. American imperialism is exerting great pressure on Sweden.

    Finally, the Tito group in the Balkans is also one of the links in the entire preparation for aggressive war. In the early stages of the Marshall Plan, it was directed under the "economic" guise, and now it is continuing openly under militarization.

    Everything can be seen from the "technology" of implementing the American aggression plan. This can be seen very clearly from the situation in France. In mid-January, American officials and "experts" responsible for distributing American "military assistance" to Western European countries met at the American Embassy in London. Related to this is the fact that two "experts" went to Paris as military supply officers to engage in "administrative arrangements" for a larger American delegation. The officers of this delegation, or more precisely, the instructors and actual commanders of the French armed forces, are going to supervise the delivery of weapons shipped from the United States. For this purpose, control over the main ports of France will be established. In addition, they will also supervise the training of the French army in the use of American weapons.

    In reality, the French armed forces are transferred into the hands of the United States. American "experts" will determine the nature and organization of the French armed forces, how to expand and use them; therefore, they will determine France's war economy, expenditures, and domestic and foreign policies. This is what American experts have done in Turkey, and it will now be repeated in France.

    The bilateral agreement between the U.S. government and the North Atlantic Group countries, which is about to be signed in Washington, marks a new stage in the implementation of the U.S. plan to arm Europe. Wall Street expects a lot from this plan.

    The rulers of the United States are very belligerent, they think they are invincible, and they think they can escape punishment for their behavior. However, the people of all countries are deeply angered by the plan to militarize Western Europe. The movement to defend peace and oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression plan is growing stronger; because the people of all countries are determined to stop the instigators of another war.

　　美国武装西欧的计划
    耶尔马萧夫著  王更生译
    杜鲁门致美国国会关于“美国情况”及关于一九五○——五一年会计年度预算的咨文，是表现着一幅图画的两面——但决不是一幅美丽的美国实况的画面。每一个有思想的美国人读了这个咨文之后，便不禁要反问自己一声：倘使一切竟是这样顺利的话，那么事情为什么这样糟糕呢？倘使总的情况真像杜鲁门所说那样好，为什么要有新的巨大军事预算呢？为什么要把这个新的、巨大的、非生产费用的重担硬加在美国人民的头上呢？可能提出这样问题的美国人——这样的人是成千成万的——只须稍为动动脑筋便可得到回答：原来杜鲁门的虚构的乐观主义是完全寄托在维持美国军事庞大机构的希望上，而新的赚钱的唯一法门便是尽量进行战争准备。
    杜鲁门在预算的咨文里，说这是“老实的预算”。但这个预算编制者对于“老实”却具有十分奇怪的观念。因为整个预算的基本观念，是准备另一次世界大战，及尽可能使更多的其他国家准备战争，以保障美国独占资本家的超额利润。
    这说明了为什么美国政府打算于一九五○至五一年会计年度中，以三○○亿美元，或总预算的百分之七十一，用于自己的武装部队，用于组织军事侵略集团的政策，和用于武装参加这个集团的国家，而同时以预算的百分之一用于教育，不足百分之一用于公共卫生。
    在一九四九至五○年本会计年度内，美国军事用费，包括执行其侵略的外交政策之经费在内，据某权威方面估计，共计达二五○亿美元。在前几年，数目比这小。用于武装力量及实施侵略的外交政策之费用（杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划及军事援助美国在欧洲的卫星国家等）之不断的增加，被将临的经济危机所加速。现在美国经济已感觉到将临的经济崩溃的凶兆，因此，把重点放在“军事援欧”计划上。
    旨在帮助美国独占资本控制西欧各国的马歇尔计划，对这些国家已有灾难性的后果。美国“慈善”对西欧各国的毁灭性的影响，从法国情况可以看得最清楚。在第二次世界大战前，法国工业生产占当时资本主义国家的工业产量总值的百分之五·四。她的工业在世界资本主义经济中占有卓越的地位。她占资本主义诸国总输入的百分之七·六，占总输出的百分之六。在世界市场上，法国能与他国，甚至能与美国，胜利地进行竞争。
    制作马歇尔计划者们，对于法国，抱有什么目的呢？他们希望挤掉她在工业上的竞争地位，想染指于她的殖民地，最后，并把她组织在美国为建立其世界霸权而组成的战略体系内。这种目的，已经大部完成：法国经济陷于泥坑了；失业正在增加着；她的工业产量，在一九四九年中叶，尚远远地落在一九二九年的生产水平之下，并且即将发生新的萧条；她的农业也陷于非常凋蔽的境地；——在华尔街的压力下，法国被迫从美国输入麦、糖和其他食品。而在第二次大战前，从美国输入的货物只占法国总输入的百分之一五·五，到一九四八年，这个数字便增加到百分之二八。另一方面，输往美国的货物，却只占总输出的百分之三·六。
    结果，对外贸易有巨大入超（一九四六年为一千一百五十亿法郎，一九四七年为一千三百三十亿法郎，一九四八年为二千二百五十亿法郎，一九四九年头八个月为一千五百五十亿法郎），通货膨胀，法郎一连三次贬值，金准备的减少，金准备一九三八年尾为二十四亿三千万美元，而一九四九年七月便只余存五亿二千三百万美元了。马歇尔计划使得法国预算长期的、巨大的不敷，巨大国债（外债与内债），实际工资的锐减，和她的劳动人民的贫困；同时，和华尔街有连系的独占资本家的公司利润，和一九三八年比较起来，竟增加到二十七倍以上。
    马歇尔计划所造成的法国惨状，是所有受到美国“援助”恩赐的西欧各国的典型。
    与西欧各国的残破的景象相反，独占资本家获取利润正像“在瘟疫流行时大摆宴会”一般。这种利润主要是由猛烈增加消费品，连同食品在内——而这些物品大部分是在美国“援助”的计划下输入的——的趸售价格特别是零售价格得来的。
    曾经吹嘘为医治战后经济病的万应灵丹的马歇尔计划，已经证明可耻的失败了。这原是可以预料得到的，因为它只是在政治上和经济上奴役西欧，使西欧服从于美国独占资本家的工具，只是使西欧各国的经济军事化，并把这些国家拖进军事侵略集团的工具。美国用马歇尔计划为手段，强迫马歇尔化国家从事军备竞赛及增加它们军费。
    正是马歇尔计划制造了西欧联盟和北大西洋集团，使美国军队能够驻扎于英国、希腊、土耳其及其他马歇尔化国家。在援助重建港口、铁道、飞机场、库房及其他基地的掩蔽下，依照美国计划准备战场及储存战略物资。
    最近许多报导，指出依照马歇尔计划，在经济援助的借口下，运送战略物资。而且，为了执行这个计划而建立起来的军事机关，同样也是在“经济合作”的伪装下进行活动的。所有这些情况，都证明了马歇尔计划的主要目的之一，是要使西欧经济充分军事化。
    当马歇尔计划已经明显的失败而美国的经济危机又已迫近眉睫的时候，北大西洋公约缔结起来了。
    曾经向人民大众把北大西洋公约说成为和平的工具。我们只须稍为回忆一下，当一九四九年四月四日在华盛顿签订这个条约的时候，美国国务卿艾奇逊曾如何花言巧语地宣布：“这个公约是觅取和平的人们走向保护所和获得力量的指南，是拔出困难的极洽意的援助”。英国贝文比他的美国伙伴更加打着伪善的腔调说：“今天不仅是公约签字的一天，也是神圣的思想的一天，——我敢说是献身于和平事业的一天”。
    但是言犹在耳，侵略集团的发起人已开始用着完全不同的口吻说话了。紧接着在四月八日，艾奇逊宣布道：“供给自由的、友谊的国家以武器和装备，是符合美国人民（应读作：美国独占资本家）的最高利益的。”
    最大限度的扩大军需生产，及交付武器和装备而获得厚利，是华尔街企图用以制服经济危机这个“魔鬼”的秘诀。同时，也是美国独占资本家希望用以打开西欧各国国界的手段。美国所担负的主要任务，就是以武器供给其附庸国。欧洲附庸国的主要任务，就是建立用美式武器装备起来的庞大陆军。这就是美国对于北大西洋公约的根本想法，也是美国对于西欧军事化的计划的根本思想。
    去年七、八月间，布莱德雷将军——美国军队的实际领导人——率领的美国海陆军将领访问欧洲，已将此点表露得很明显。这位将军可以毫不冤枉地列入果戈理在《死灵魂》中所描述的这一类人的典型中，“假如不熟悉火药的烟，至少是熟悉烟草的烟的”。他们好战的野心，是无限的，但是，要注意，他们总是希望别人替其作战的。
    布莱德雷将军去欧洲前，对众院外交委员会发表了一次演说，他在演说中讲出了美国的“健全的战略观念”的轮廓。要言之，他说，在西欧可以找到足够人当炮灰。
    这位将军的论据是这样的：加入北大西洋公约的欧洲国家的人口总数，超过一亿五千万人，当它们的士兵获得武器后，便可以“住守任何西欧地带的防御中心堡垒”。布莱德雷并不讳言美国军国主义者之赞成著名的“军事援助计划”，是基于这个“基本原则”之上的。
    真的，美国的“健全的战略观念”；一点也不受欧洲所欢迎。曼彻斯特卫报说：美国人企图用区区十亿余美元，购买欧洲军队的最高战略指挥权；当时美、英两国间的纷歧意见，使伦敦每日邮报说及英美两国间有发生“大西洋冷战”之危险。
    但是华盛顿方面仍继续坚持它的“观念”，并且行其所是。它这样坚持的理由是非常明显的。美国本身军费增加得这么迅速，它只能扩大到一定的限度。因此，必须把西欧变成它的军需品的尾闾，把欧洲的军队变成它的消费者。美国正迫使其附庸国扩张军队至最大限度。因为这样就一石打三鸟：加强美国对马歇尔化国家之控制，扩大在美帝指挥下的军事机构，并扩大军需品市场——这是今日美国工业输出的主要项目。
    现在北大西洋公约已把新的锁链加在西欧各国的颈上了，这不再是一时有利可图的军需品的交易行为，而是按照美国计划把西欧经济和政治生活改变而使之军事化。
    北大西洋同盟诸国家，只有在个别和美国缔结双边协定的条件下，才能获得美国所答应的“军事援助”。英、美缔结双边协定的谈判于今年正月九日在华盛顿举行，其他北大西洋盟约国和美国双边协定谈判也将相继举行。
    这些谈判，先在华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎进行许多协商——主要是军事性质的。特别是美国代表团要求废除西欧联盟军事常设委员会，而把侵略集团的指挥权全归美国。根据布鲁塞尔《前线报》消息，美国军事当局希望北大西洋盟约国的战略的总的指挥权由华盛顿行使，北大西洋公约防御委员会的代表派人参加各盟国的参谋部，以此来调整各国的军事行动。
    很显明的，美国方面的这个企图，不仅是要攫取这个集团的指挥权，而且也是要保证整个西欧军事化的巨大赚钱计划是有利于美国独占资本家。
    尽管美国的政客们武断地说什么美国安全受到威胁，这样扩张军备是没有任何理由的。这些人打算把美国的国界移到易北河。
    美国某些领袖们甚至并不以为须要掩饰美国汲汲于军事准备的动机。例如艾森豪威尔将军在一九四九年九月二十日在众院军备委员会宣称：“美国团结起来，就能够统治全世界”。“统治全世界”这句话正确地说明了美国独占资本家要使欧洲军事化的目的。
    “军事援助计划”的目标，远较从其第一次拨款所能判断者为大。在一九五○至五一年预算中，此项拨款为十三亿五千九百万美元，这仅仅是实行阴谋反对世界和平与安全的基本计划的总经费的一小部分。“军事援助计划”保证了美国的欧洲“盟国”的军费的不断增加，这将是美国帝国主义的聚宝盆的源泉，并且也许不会干涸或变小。华尔街是不愿供养它的附庸。恰恰相反，它企图把他们身上最后的一件衬衣都剥去。因为只有这样，才能保证欧洲军事化的计划之实现；而这可使美国独占资本家大获超额利润。
    为了履行它们的义务，北大西洋盟约国不断增加它们的军费，主要的是用以购买美国武器，或者在国内组织军需生产及这些武器零件生产之用。下面的数字，表明马歇尔化国家一九四八——四九年的军费（以美元计算）较一九三八——三九年的军费的增加情形：英国自十四亿元增至三十亿元，或增加百分之一一四；法国自八亿元增至十五亿元，或增加百分之八八；比利牛斯半岛国家自三亿五千万元增至十亿元，或增加百分之一八六；斯堪的那维亚半岛国家自一亿元增至五亿元，或增加百分之四○○。这些军备费用的增加，使得这些国家的整个经济生活充满了灾难，是财政破产和劳动民众贫困化的主要原因之一。但是马歇尔化国家当局，受了华盛顿的鞭策，仍继续增加军费。
    军事化计划正以最大的速度进行着。布莱德雷将军说明美国的“健全的战略观念”的意思。说美国较之任何时期更加依靠于它的盟国的陆军之扩大。华尔街要加重马歇尔化国家的负担。华盛顿的不幸的同盟者，在去年十一月杪和十二月初，巴黎北大西洋公约诸国的参谋总长会谈以及其后的国防部长会议，已有机会看出此点了。在这些会议上曾经最坦白的、最详细的讨论着军事问题。例如，讨论的一个问题是北大西洋集团的军队分布问题，讨论守莱茵河防线呢，还是易北河防线呢，哪一防线较为有利？根据外国报纸的许多报导，可以看出会议所讨论的主题，是美国“防御计划”，或者毋宁说，是美国战争计划。出席会议的各代表，必须赞同这项计划并毫无保留地接受。详细情形，自然是保守秘密的，但有些决议已公开了。本年一月初，西欧及美国报纸登载说，“联合军事计划”业经北大西洋集团的军事委员会所批准。这是一月六日通过的。据美联社报导，战争初期的重负势将“由法国军队担任”。至于美、英的军队是这样规定的：
    “美、英在西德的占领军，连同荷兰、比利时的军队，也将并为共同的西欧军”。
    最近，有许多西欧和美国报纸，报导美国计划将给予在华尔街控制下的西欧各国什么什么任务。例如，巴黎法国周报说：布莱德雷计划重新武装西德，建立一支由纳粹将军们率领的庞大的西德军队，也将武装一支意大利的军队。
    最近美、英官方讨论讨好佛朗哥的问题，使能在英、美集团的军事计划中充分利用西班牙法西斯主义。这是值得注意的事情。一般相信，除了在西班牙耗费了十亿美元建立美国基地之外，英、美侵略者们将做到使佛朗哥的军队扩大至二百万人。
    瑞典在形式上，至今尚非北大西洋集团的会员国。美帝对瑞典正施以重大的压力。
    最后，巴尔干半岛的铁托集团，也是整个侵略战争准备的环节之一。在马歇尔计划初期，是在“经济的”假装之下指挥着，现在正继续以军事化下公开进行着。
    从执行美国侵略计划的“技术”，就可看出一切。这从法国的情况，可以看得出很明显。一月中旬，负责分配美国对西欧各国“军事援助”的美国官员和“专家”，在美国驻伦敦大使馆开会。与此事有连带关系的，是两个“专家”以军需官身份到巴黎去，为更大的美国代表团从事“行政上的布置”。这一代表团的军官，或者更明白地说，法国武装力量的教官及实际指挥人，是去监督自美国运往的武器的交付，为了这个目的，将建立对于法国主要港口的控制权。此外，还将监督法国军队使用美国武器的训练。
    实际上，法国武装力量移入美国的掌握中。美国“专家”将决定法国武装力量的性质和组织，如何扩充和运用；因此，他们将决定法国的战争经济、经费和国内外政策。这就是美国专家在土耳其所做的，现又将在法国重演。
    美国政府与北大西洋集团诸国的双边协定，行将在华盛顿签字，这只是标帜着美国武装欧洲计划实行的新阶段。华尔街对此计划期望颇多。
    美国的统治者们是非常好战的，他们以为自己是不能被击破的，并且以为他们如此行为是能够免于惩罚的。但是，各国人民深深地被西欧军事化计划所激怒了。保卫和平、反对美国帝国主义侵略计划的运动，日益强大；因为各国人民已决心制止另一次战争的煽动者们了。
