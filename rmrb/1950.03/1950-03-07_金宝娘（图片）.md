    Jin Baoniang said sadly, "I am a lowly woman, my reputation is ruined, I live worse than a dog! Everyone looks down on me, even my relatives don't associate with me." Old Ma said, "I understand, I was too unfair to you yesterday!" Jin Baoniang cried and said, "I've lived like neither human nor ghost for over ten years... I shed tears in my stomach every day... I also know this is a shameful thing... Sometimes I want to die, but I can't leave Jinbao behind! The child suffers with me, and people bully him on the street. Jinbao is also sensible, he silently endures the insults from others, and my heart breaks when I think about it!"

    Old Ma comforted her, "Today is the day we sufferers should turn over. We should think about who harmed you like this!" Jin Baoniang said, "I think about it every day. I used to hate Liu Guicai; I also blamed my bad luck, that I was destined to suffer this crime. After I heard your speech at the meeting the day you came, I didn't sleep for two days and two nights." As she spoke, she took out a bloody garment from a rotten box on the ground and shook it for Old Ma to see. She said, "This is all Jinbao's father's blood. It was all caused by that Liu Guicai, the damned landlord, who also ruined me like this."
    (Forty-seven)
    When the struggle meeting was launched in Diantou Village, Jin Baoniang was the first to complain to the landlord Liu Guicai. She told how Liu Guicai seduced her, forced her husband away, forced her mother-in-law to death, how he sent her to the blockhouse, and how he made her live a subhuman life for the past ten years... Everyone in the audience sighed, and the women secretly cried. Jin Baoniang initially spoke and cried, but then fainted. The whole audience was furious and unanimously demanded that Liu Guicai be handed over to the People's Court for handling.

    金宝娘
    邢琏画
    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （四十五）
    金宝娘悲惨地说：“我是个下贱女人，名声坏，活的还不如一条狗！谁也看不起我，亲戚也不和我来往了。”老马说：“我清楚了，昨天那样太对不起你了！”金宝娘哭着说：“这样人不人鬼不鬼十来年了，……每天眼泪朝肚里流，……我也知道这是下贱事，……有时想寻死，可是又留不下金宝！孩子跟上我也受罪了，走到街上，人人欺侮他。金宝也懂事了，别人骂的话，小心眼也受着老大委屈，想起来我心都碎咧！”
    （四十六）
    老马安慰她说：“今天就该我们这些受罪人翻身了。谁害成你这样，应当想一想！”金宝娘说：“我每天都在想，以前我恨刘贵财；也怨自己命不好，命里注定受这份罪。你来那天开会讲了话，我听了回来，两天两夜没睡着。”她一面说，一面从地下烂箱子里翻出一件血衣，抖着让老马看。她说：“这都是金宝爹的血。都是地主刘贵财那挨刀的，又害成我这样。”
    （四十七）
    店头村发动起斗争会时，金宝娘第一个向地主刘贵财诉苦。她讲刘贵财怎样勾引她，逼走她的男人，逼死了她的婆婆，怎样把她送上碉堡，又害得她这十几年过着非人非鬼的生活……全场人都在叹息，女人们偷偷的哭了。金宝娘起初是一面讲一面哭，随后一下气昏过去了。全场的人怒不可遏，当场一致要求将刘贵财送交人民法庭外理。
