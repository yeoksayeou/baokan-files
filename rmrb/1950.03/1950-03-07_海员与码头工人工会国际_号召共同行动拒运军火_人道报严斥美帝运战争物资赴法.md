　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th: According to a report from Agence Télégraphique Parisienne on March 3rd cited by L'Humanité: The Seafarers and Dockworkers International (an industrial department of the World Federation of Trade Unions) has issued a call to seafarers and dockworkers worldwide, urging them to take joint action to refuse to transport or load and unload war materials, in order to defend their own cause and defend humanity. The call also urges them to organize peace committees in various docks, ships, and shipyards.

　　L'Humanité stated: Under the North Atlantic Treaty "Military Assistance Program," arms will begin to be shipped on March 6th. The U.S. government has announced that the first batch of American arms sent to the French government will be shipped from Norfolk, Virginia, on that day. The first shipment will include fifty "Corsair" fighters and Hell Diver dive bombers. At the same time, large quantities of cannons, armored vehicles, ammunition, military equipment, and transport aircraft are also being transported to American ports, preparing for shipment to North Atlantic Treaty nations. L'Humanité also stated that the reason France is the first to "benefit" from "military aid" is because the North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that France will be responsible for the main task of land warfare in the event of war.

    号召共同行动拒运军火   
    人道报严斥美帝运战争物资赴法
    【新华社北京六日电】据电通社巴黎三日电引人道报消息：海员与码头工人工会国际（世界工联产业部之一）已向全世界海员及码头工人发出号召，敦促他们共同行动，拒绝运输或装卸战争物资，以保卫自己的事业并保卫人道。该号召并敦促他们在各码头、各船只及造船厂中，组织和平委员会。
    人道报称：在北大西洋公约“军事援助计划”之下的军火，将于三月六日开始装运。美国政府已经宣布，首批送往法政府的美国军火将于当日自弗吉尼亚州的诺福克港运出。首批装运的物资将包括“海盗式”战斗机及地狱式俯冲轰炸机五十架。同时大批的大炮，装甲车辆，弹药，军用装备以及运输机等，亦在向美国港口运输，准备向北大西洋公约国家装运。人道报又称，法国之所以在“军事援助”中首先“受惠”，是因为北大西洋公约规定法国在战争中担任陆地作战的主要任务。
