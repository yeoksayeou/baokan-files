Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th. Of the 146 cities and counties in Shandong Province, 113 cities, counties, and urban districts have successively convened representative conferences of people from all walks of life. Among them, Jinan, Dezhou, and Xin Hailian have held four meetings. The meetings in various places have promoted the spirit of democracy, further strengthened the ties between the government and the people, and resolved some important practical issues concerning the lives of the broad masses of people, such as urban labor-capital relations, urban-rural trade issues, rural production and disaster relief, winter plowing, sideline production, grain requisition, and taxation. Before the meetings in various places, relatively adequate preparations were generally made. The purpose and significance of convening the meetings were widely publicized among cadres and the people. In the cities, the People's Government used forums, newspapers, speeches, and other methods, while in the rural areas, blackboard newspapers and market publicity were adopted to allow people from all walks of life to deliberate in advance and put forward opinions. The People's Government prepared realistic work reports before the meetings, first consulting with the representatives and then extensively soliciting the opinions of the people through them. Representatives from Yishui County were deeply moved after listening to the government's work report and work suggestions, as well as its self-criticism of shortcomings in its work. They generally reflected that they used to think that the government was the superior and they were guests, but now they understood that the government was for the people and they were the masters of the government. In cities and counties that have held representative conferences of people from all walks of life, the relationship between the government and the people has become closer, and the government's work has proceeded more smoothly than in the past due to the assistance of representatives from all walks of life. After discussing the situation and policies at the meetings, representatives from various places understood the difficulties in the current victory and the conditions for overcoming them, increased their confidence in overcoming difficulties, and provided various ways to overcome the difficulties. For example, a worker representative from Qingdao City said: "Only by developing production can we improve our lives." At the representative conferences in various counties, many representatives generally requested tax reductions and exemptions at the beginning. However, after detailed discussions, the representatives realized the current financial difficulties of the government. For example, a representative from Weibei County said: "It is not right to just think about reducing or exempting public grain when the harvest is not good; we must use the method of production and frugality to solve the problem." At the people's representative conferences in many counties and cities, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors also voluntarily withdrew proposals for tax reductions and exemptions. After the meetings, various places organized standing committees to systematically convey the resolutions to people from all walks of life and implement the resolutions. After the representative conference of people from all walks of life in Licheng County, three committees were established for production and disaster relief, stone quarrying, and promotion of mountain fruits, to assist and organize the masses to engage in production and disaster relief. Within half a month after the meeting, the stone quarrying committee mobilized and organized 750 stone workers and 1,100 carts, quarrying and transporting 8,000 cubic meters of stone, earning a total of 650,000 catties of work-relief grain, which solved the difficulties of some disaster-stricken households. With the help of the mountain fruit promotion committee, more than 2 million catties of the 3 million catties of mountain fruits produced in the three districts of the county were sold within a month. Weifang City also organized 4,000 disaster victims to participate in ramie rope sideline production after the meeting, and launched a production and self-rescue movement. The Fourth Representative Conference of People from All Circles in Jinan City played a considerable role in promoting public bonds in the city. For example, a gentry representative only planned to buy four or five shares of public bonds before the meeting. Because he understood the significance of buying public bonds at the meeting, he bought fifty shares after the meeting and mobilized his friends to buy more than four hundred shares. The representatives also went to shops and factories to mobilize and publicize, so that the city's public bond sales exceeded the target.

　　山东省一百一十三个市县
    曾先后召开各界代表会议
    解决城乡贸易等重要实际问题进一步密切政府与人民的联系
    【新华社济南十日电】山东全省一百四十六个市、县中，已有一百一十三个市、县及城区先后召开了各界人民代表会议。其中济南、德州、新海连三市已开过四次会议。各地会议都发扬了民主精神，进一步密切了政府与人民的联系，解决了一些涉及广大人民生活的如城市劳资关系、城乡贸易问题、农村生产救灾、冬耕、副业生产征收公粮、税收等重要的实际问题。各地会议在会前一般都进行了较充分的准备。在干部和人民中广泛地宣传了召开会议的目的和意义。在城市里，人民政府利用了座谈会、报纸、讲演等方式，在农村中则采用黑板报和集市宣传，使各界人民预先酝酿，提出意见。人民政府在会前都准备了合乎实际情况的工作报告，先与代表们进行协商，然后通过他们广泛地征求人民的意见。沂水县的代表们在听了政府的工作报告和工作建议以及对工作中缺点的自我批评后，都很感动，普遍反映说：过去认为政府是上级，我们是客人，现在明白了政府就是为了人民，我们就是政府的主人。凡开过各界人民代表会议的市、县，政府和人民的关系密切了，政府各项工作的进行也因获得各界代表的协助而较过去顺利了。各地代表在会议中讨论了形势和政策之后，明白了目前胜利中的困难和克服困难的条件，增加了克服困难的信心，并提供了各种克服困难的办法。如青岛市工人代表说：“只有发展生产，才能改善生活。”在各县代表会议中，开始时许多代表曾普遍要求减免负担。但经过详细讨论后，代表们均认识到目前政府的财政困难。如潍北县的代表说：“年成不好，光想减免公粮是不对的，要用生产节约的办法来解决。”在许多县、市的人民代表会议上，工商界代表也都自动撤销了减免税收一类的提案。各地代表会议在会后均组织了常务委员会，有组织地向各界人民传达决议，并贯彻决议的执行。历城县各界人民代表会在会后建立了生产救灾、打石头和推销山果三个委员会，协助和组织群众进行生产救灾。打石委员会在会后半个月中即动员和组织了七百五十个打石工人和一千一百辆大车，打运了八千石方，共赚工赈粮六十五万斤，解决了部分灾荒户的困难。在山果推销委员会帮助下，该县三个区所出产的三百余万斤山果，于一个月中即已销出二百余万斤。潍坊市在会后也组织了四千名灾民参加打麻绳副业，展开了生产自救运动。济南市第四次各界人民代表会议，对该市推销公债起了相当作用。如一位士绅代表在会前只准备买四、五分公债，由于在会上明了了购买公债的意义，会后买了五十分，并动员朋友买了四百多分。代表们并分向商店和工厂进行动员和宣传，使该市公债推销得超额完成任务。
