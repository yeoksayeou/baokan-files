Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 29th: The Shanghai Military Control Commission, upon the request of the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee, issued an order on the 16th of this month to receive the aid-the-bandit supplies previously stored in Shanghai by the China branch of the former United States Economic Cooperation Administration for disaster relief purposes. The distribution plan and ratios for these materials have been discussed and drafted by the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee in conjunction with the East China Production and Disaster Relief Committee, and approved by the East China Military and Political Committee at its administrative meeting on March 21st. Half of the total inventory of materials will be handed over to the Central People's Government for distribution to other disaster areas outside of East China, while the remaining half will be distributed to various parts of East China. Within East China, the distribution ratios are determined according to the severity and urgency of the disasters in each region, as well as their disaster relief capabilities, as follows: Shanghai, due to being bombed by enemy aircraft, requires extensive emergency rescue and evacuation work, and is allocated 50 percent; the northern Anhui region has suffered severe disaster and urgently needs to resolve the spring famine, and is allocated 35 percent; Shandong also has a relatively severe disaster situation, but the local disaster relief work foundation and capabilities are stronger, and is allocated 10 percent; the southern Anhui region is allocated 3 percent; the southern Jiangsu region is allocated 2 percent. Northern Jiangsu has previously received some grain from other sources, so it will not be allocated this time. Furthermore, the East China Production and Disaster Relief Committee, considering that northern Anhui suffers from severe disaster and urgently needs relief, has already allocated 20 million jin of grain for emergency relief.

    接收美帝援匪物资
    分配各地救济灾民
    【新华社上海二十九日电】上海市军事管制委员会根据沪市生产救灾委员会的请求，于本月十六日下令接收前美国经济合作总署中国分署存沪的援匪物资充作救灾之用后，该项物资的分配计划及比率已经沪市生产救灾委员会与华东生产救灾委员会举行联席会议后商讨拟定，并经华东军政委员会三月二十一日行政会议批准。全部库存物资除半数缴由中央人民政府分配给华东以外的其他灾区外，其余半数分配给华东各地。华东方面，根据各地灾情轻重缓急和救灾能力等情况决定分配比率如下：上海因遭敌机轰炸，急救与疏散工作需用浩大，决定分配百分之五十；皖北区灾情严重，且春荒急待解决，分配百分之三十五；山东灾情亦较重，但当地救灾工作基础及能力较强，分配百分之十；皖南区分配百分之三；苏南区分配百分之二。苏北前已由其他方面拨去部分粮食，故此次暂不分配。又华东生产救灾委员会以皖北区灾重急待救济，已先拨粮食二千万斤进行急赈。
