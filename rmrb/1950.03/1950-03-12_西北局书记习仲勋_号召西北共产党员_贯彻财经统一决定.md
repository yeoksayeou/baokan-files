　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th. Xi Zhongxun, Second Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a statement resolutely stating that the Communist Party members in the Northwest region will resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to ensure the rapid and complete realization of the State Council's decision to unify the national financial and economic work. He said: Today, how to solve the economic problems closely related to the people's lives requires our party members, with the same perseverance that they used to overcome difficulties in the past, to lead the people tirelessly to implement the State Council's decision to unify financial and economic work. He emphasized: We Communist Party members must first recognize that only by achieving unity in financial and economic work can we consolidate the victories already achieved in the military and political fields. Therefore, all Communist Party members and non-Party friends in our Northwest region must mobilize, conscientiously study the State Council's decision and the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and formulate implementation plans for various departments in accordance with the spirit of these documents. We must conduct serious and irreconcilable struggles against the views of some party members who despise taxation and are unwilling to do tax work. The ideas of extravagance, waste, and not cherishing the interests of the people and the motherland that still exist among some Communist Party members in our Northwest region must be eliminated. What is even more serious is that individual Communist Party members have phenomena of corruption and degeneration. These people flaunt their "seniority" and consider themselves extraordinary. We must repeatedly warn them to quickly reflect and resolve to correct themselves. If they do not do so, they will be spurned by the people. Finally, he called on all Communist Party members in the Northwest region to redouble their efforts and use the Bolshevik fighting spirit to complete the task given to us by the Central People's Government—to rapidly and completely realize the decision to unify financial and economic work.

    号召西北共产党员  贯彻财经统一决定
    【新华社西安十日电】中共中央西北局第二书记习仲勋发表谈话，坚决表示西北地区的共产党员将坚决执行中共中央的指示，保证迅速全部实现政务院统一国家财政经济工作的决定。他说：今天如何解决与人民生活息息相关的经济问题，就需要我们党员本着过去战胜困难的那种坚毅精神，毫不懈怠地领导人民去实施政务院统一财政经济工作的决定。他着重说：我们共产党员首先要认清只有达到财政经济工作上的统一，才能巩固军事上、政治上已得到的胜利。因此，我们西北地区全体共产党员和党外朋友，必须动员起来，认真地学习政务院的决定和中共中央的指示，根据这些文件的精神制定出各部门的实施计划。我们要向某些党员中存在的轻视税收观点、不愿作税收工作的思想进行严肃的不调和的斗争。我们西北地区有些共产党员中还存在着的铺张、浪费、不爱护人民祖国利益的思想，必须加以清除。更严重的是个别共产党员有贪污腐化的现象，这些人摆“老资格”，自命不凡，我们要再三告诫他赶快反省，决心改正，如果不这样做，将会被人民唾弃。最后，他号召西北地区全体共产党员，加倍努力，用布尔什维克的战斗精神来完成中央人民政府给予我们的任务——迅速全部实现统一财政经济工作的决定。
