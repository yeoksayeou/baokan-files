Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th—Over the past year, Tianjin's female workers, like their male counterparts, have made significant contributions to the recovery and development of industrial production. Tianjin currently has more than 30,000 female workers, accounting for 9.4% of the city's total workforce. In factories such as textile and tobacco, female workers account for 40% to 50% of the total number of employees, and the vast majority are direct production workers. Many female workers have now mastered advanced skills. In the weaving workshop of Tianjin No. 4 Textile Factory, many female workers can now operate twenty automatic looms, breaking the factory's highest record. The female workers in the spinning room of the factory can operate an average of 400 spindles per person, saving the factory one-fifth of its labor force compared to the past, and freeing up 320 workers to engage in the production work of the new factory. Liu Yinfu, a female thread-connecting worker in Tianjin No. 3 Textile Factory, was selected as one of Tianjin's twelve production models last year due to her excellent production performance. This year, on "March 8th" Women's Day, Tianjin factories selected another thirty-one female production models. Due to the improvement of living conditions and the enhancement of class consciousness, approximately 90% of Tianjin's female workers have now joined trade union organizations; among them, more than 260 female workers have been elected as directors and members of branch committees. Nearly half of the committee members have studied at the Communist Party School, the Communist Youth League School, and the Workers' and Cadres' School. Many female workers have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League; the seven factories affiliated with the China Textile Company alone have more than 150 female party members. Tianjin's female workers have a high enthusiasm for cultural learning. In December of last year, 1,461 female workers from major production units participated in spare-time learning, accounting for more than 35% of all students. In addition, nearly 200 female workers participated in political and technical training classes. In the No. 2 Electric Factory and the private Hengyuan Yarn Factory, more than ten female workers each have begun to study maintenance, fitter, and lathe work in their spare time.

　　津三万女工努力生产
    生活改善觉悟提高十分之九参加工会
    【新华社天津十二日电】一年来天津市女工在工业生产的恢复和发展中和男工一样地作出了重要的贡献。天津现有女工三万多人，占全市工人总数的百分之九点四。在纺织、烟草等工厂中，女工人数达职工总数的百分之四十到五十，且绝大多数是直接生产工。不少女工现已掌握了较高的技术。天津中纺四厂织布厂有不少女工已能看管二十台自动织布机，打破了该厂的最高纪录。该厂细纱间女工平均一人能看四百个纱锭，使该厂较过去节省了五分之一的人力，抽出了三百二十个工人来从事新厂的生产工作。中纺三厂捻头女工刘荫福由于生产成绩优异，去年被选为天津市十二个生产模范之一。今年“三八”节天津各工厂又选出了三十一位妇女生产模范。由于生活的改善和阶级觉悟的提高，目前天津市约有百分之九十的女工已参加了工会组织；其中有二百六十多位女工当选为分会的主任及委员。近半数的委员曾在共产党党校、青年团团校及职工干部学校学习过。不少女工加入了共产党和青年团，仅中纺公司所属七个厂即有女工党员一百五十余名。天津女工文化学习的情绪很高。在去年十二月，各主要生产单位的女工参加业余学习的有一千四百六十一人，占全部学员的百分之三十五强。此外，并有近二百名女工参加了政治、技术学习班。电工二厂和私营恒源纱厂各有女工十余名，已开始在工余学习保全、钳工、车工等工作。
