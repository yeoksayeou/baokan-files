Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Provisional Organizational Regulations of the General Administration of Customs have been approved by the Government Administration Council and a circular has been issued to all regions for implementation. From now on, all customs offices across the country should be directly under the General Administration of Customs in accordance with the organizational regulations, directly led by the General Administration, and subject to the guidance of the government of the large administrative region where they are located. To this end, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued a notice on the 8th, stipulating that all customs offices across the country should immediately establish a superior-subordinate relationship with the General Administration of Customs and be directly led by the General Administration. All matters related to the organization, personnel, administration, and operations of the customs should be reported to the General Administration for instructions. All regulations, orders, and instructions issued by the General Administration should be strictly followed. Without the approval of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and the General Administration of Customs, no region may freely make changes.

The notice also stipulates that local customs offices will continue to be guided by the financial committees of the large administrative regions or directly-administered municipalities where they are located and maintain close working relationships with foreign trade management agencies. The Northeast Customs Administration Bureau and the Customs Department of the South China Financial and Economic Committee will be retained as representative agencies of the General Administration of Customs and will be led by the local financial and economic committees to strengthen customs work in these regions. All customs offices in the Northeast and South China, in addition to being directly under the General Administration of Customs, will also be led by the local financial and economic committees and their customs management agencies. Institutions or departments specifically in charge of customs established in other large administrative regions should be abolished immediately. The notice stipulates that local financial and economic committees may submit proposals to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council regarding the establishment, abolition, or alteration of customs houses, branch customs houses, and sub-branch customs houses. Cadres, military representatives, takeover commissioners, tax commissioners, customs chiefs, liaison officers, and former customs staff who were originally assigned to various customs offices to handle takeover work must not be withdrawn and should remain in the customs work and be allocated uniformly by the General Administration.

The notice stipulates that before the unified remittance of customs revenue to the central treasury, the revenue and expenditure of each customs office will still be managed and audited by the financial committees of the large administrative regions in accordance with the current methods. The revenue and expenditure of tax revenues should be reported to the Central Financial and Economic Committee and the General Administration of Customs on time. After the customs revenue is unified and used by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, it should be implemented in accordance with the new regulations.

　　政务院财经委员会通知各地
    执行海关总署试行组织条例
    【新华社十六日讯】海关总署试行组织条例已经政务院通过并通令各地执行，今后全国各地海关按组织条例均应即直隶于海关总署，由该总署直接领导，并受其所在地大行政区政府之指导。政务院财政经济委员会为此于八日发出通知，规定全国各地海关均应立即和海关总署建立上下级的关系，受总署直接领导；一切有关海关的组织、人事、行政、业务等均应向总署报告请示；总署所颁发的一切规章、命令、指示应严格地遵照执行；不经政务院财政经济委员会及海关总署批准，各地不得自由变更。
    通知并规定各地海关仍继续受其所在地的大行政区或直属市财委会之指导，并与对外贸易管理机关保持密切的工作联系。东北海关管理局、华南财政经济委员会海关处仍予保留，作为海关总署之代表机关，并受当地财政经济委员会之领导，以加强该地区的海关工作。东北、华南各海关，除同样应即直隶于海关总署受总署直接领导外，同时并受当地财政经济委员会及其海关管理机构的领导。其他大行政区内所设专管海关之机构或部门，应即撤销。通知规定：海关、分关、支关的设立、撤销、改变，各地财政经济委员会得向政务院财政经济委员会提出建议。原派各海关办接管工作的干部人员如军代表、接管专员、税务司、关长、联络员及旧海关职员，均不得抽出，应仍保留在海关工作，由总署统一调配。
    通知规定：在关税收入尚未统一解缴中央国库前，各海关之收入及开支，暂仍照现行办法由大行政区财委负责掌握审核。税收及经费开支情况，应按时报告中央财政经济委员会和海关总署。在关税收入已归中央人民政府财政部统一调度使用后，即应按新规定执行。
