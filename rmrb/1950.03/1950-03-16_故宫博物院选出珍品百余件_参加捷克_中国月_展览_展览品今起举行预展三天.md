[This newspaper dispatch] In order to celebrate the great victory of the Chinese people, Czechoslovakia will hold a "Month of China" in its capital, Prague, in May of this year to introduce our country's culture and the great creations of the working people. The Ministry of Culture of our Central People's Government has specially instructed the Palace Museum to select more than 150 pieces of artistic works from its collection, such as porcelain, enamel, embroidery, kesi silk tapestries, carvings, lacquerware, and realistic paintings from the Ming and Qing dynasties, to participate in this exhibition. The museum has now selected the exhibits and decided to hold a preview for three days, on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month, in the Qianqing Palace in the central part of the Forbidden City. After they return to China in the future, they will be exhibited again in the museum.
