　　Change Scattered Work Methods, Leading Cadres Take the Lead in Learning
    Beipiao Sixth District Cadres Eliminate Illiteracy
    [Report from this newspaper] Rehe News: All worker-peasant cadres in the Sixth District of Beipiao County have persisted in studying for a year, eliminated illiteracy, and improved their work. Before 1948, the cadre learning system in the district failed to be sustained and was hot and cold, with little effect. In February last year, the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first studied the reasons why cadre learning was not going well: on the one hand, leading cadres did not play a leading role; on the other hand, cadres were scattered. Most cadres were illiterate, and it was difficult to study independently. In order to improve the above situation, the responsible cadres of the District Committee first reviewed their past mistakes of not paying attention to learning and not grasping the leadership of learning tightly at the general cadre meeting, and launched a discussion on learning issues among all cadres in the district. Everyone realized that in the peaceful environment of leading production and construction work, some of the past work methods were no longer applicable, and that if they did not continue to learn, they would not be able to improve their work. Then, everyone discussed the so-called problem of "being too busy with work and not having time to study" in the past. Everyone agreed that this was just an excuse for not paying attention to learning, and that there was actually time to study. When discussing how to solve the difficulties in learning, the district leaders decided to change the past working methods. The entire district was divided into four small districts, and cadres were assigned to work in each small district according to their work ability and cultural level. In this way, not only can mutual assistance learning be carried out, but it is also beneficial to the work, because in the past, one cadre was in charge of one village, and cadres with lower abilities often encountered difficulties that could not be solved; now, when there are problems, everyone studies together, and the promotion of work is also smoother. Everyone was very happy, and then discussed and formulated learning conventions and reward and punishment methods, and elected a learning committee to lead the learning. In the learning convention, everyone agreed on their own: study on time, no lateness or early departure; concentrate during study, no arguing or chatting; speak enthusiastically during discussions. It was also stipulated that a test should be held once a month.
    After this rectification, the leading cadres have always adhered to the learning system. The Learning Committee promptly arranged the study of documents, and the leaders of each study group held four meetings regularly every month to exchange learning situations and experiences in various places. Those who studied well were commended and rewarded by the district every month. For the past year, all cadres in the district have been able to persist in learning. Up to now, there are no illiterate people in the district (when learning began, 18 of the 31 cadres were illiterate, and the remaining 13 had attended elementary school). For example, Cui Shuli, the deputy organizing member of the District Committee, used to be completely illiterate, but now he can write party member report forms and simple letters. The illiterate Lin Shuwen can now read "New Countryside" and "Mass News". The thinking and work style of the cadres have also undergone significant changes. The female cadre Mei Jiuzhen used to be very backward in her thinking and had a deep family concept, but after learning, she has made rapid progress and is very active in her work. In the spring work of 1948, half of the cadres in the district had beaten people; after learning, no beating incidents occurred throughout 1949. Because learning is combined with the central work, cadres feel that they have something to say when they go to the village to publicize and explain to the masses, and there are more work methods. Therefore, the learning enthusiasm is even higher.
    At present, the shortcomings of cadre learning in the district are that there is only learning combined with the central work, and the business learning of cadres in various departments is poor. At the same time, ordinary cadres only study the designated documents during the specified time, and do not study enough on their own at other times. These still need to be further improved.

　　改变分散工作方式  领导干部带头学习
    北票六区干部消灭文盲
    【本报讯】热河消息：北票县六区全体工农干部，一年来坚持学习，消灭了文盲，提高了工作。该区在一九四八年以前，干部学习制度未能坚持，忽冷忽热，收效很少。去年二月，中共区委会首先研究了干部学习搞不好的原因：一方面是领导干部没有起带头作用；一方面是干部分散。大部分干部是文盲，单独进行自学很困难。为改善上述情况，区委负责干部首先在全体干部会上检讨了自己过去不重视学习，对学习领导抓得不紧的错误，并发动全区干部讨论了学习问题。大家认识到今后在和平环境内领导生产建设工作，过去的工作方法有些已不适用了，再不学习就不能提高工作。接着，大家又讨论过去所谓“工作忙，没时间学习”的问题。大家一致认为这只是不重视学习而找的借口，实际上是有时间学习的。讨论到解决学习中的困难时，区领导上决定改变过去工作方式。将全区划作四个小区，根据干部工作能力和文化程度分配在各小区集中工作。这样，不独可以进行互助学习，而且对工作有好处，因为过去一个干部掌握一个村，能力较低的干部时常遇到困难无法解决；现在有了问题大家一起研究，推动工作也顺利了。这样大家都很高兴，又讨论订立学习公约和奖励处罚办法，并选举了学习委员会领导学习。在学习公约中，大家自己议定：按时学习，不许迟到早退；学习时集中精神，不斗嘴、闲扯；讨论时热烈发言。又规定：每月举行测验一次。
    经过这次整顿后，领导干部一直坚持了学习制度。学委会及时布置学习文件，各学习小组长每月定时开四次会，交流各地学习情况和经验。对学习好的，每月都由区给予表扬和奖励。一年以来，全区干部都能坚持学习。到现在，全区没有文盲了（开始学习时，三十一个干部中有十八人为文盲，其余十三人上过小学）。如区委副组织委员崔树立，以前一字不识，现在能写党员报告表，写简单信。文盲蔺书文已能看《新农村》和《大众报》了。干部的思想和工作作风也有显著改变。妇女干部梅九珍过去思想很落后，家庭观念深，经过学习进步非常快，工作很积极了。一九四八年春季工作中全区干部一半打过人；学习以后，一九四九年全年没有发生过打人的现象。由于学习结合中心工作进行，干部到村工作都感到向群众宣传解释时有话说了，工作方法也多了。因此学习情绪更高。
    目前该区干部学习的缺点是，只有与中心工作结合的学习，而各部门干部业务学习差。同时，一般干部只在规定的时间学习指定的文件，在其他时间自学不够。这些尚待更进一步改善。
