　　Shijiazhuang Textile Company and Daxing Yarn Factory Renew Cotton Yarn Exchange Contract
    Appropriately Adjusting Cotton Yarn Exchange Ratio
    [Our Dispatch] The Shijiazhuang branch of the Textile Company has renewed its raw cotton exchange finished product contract with the Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory to ensure the smooth progress of production and sales. The cotton yarn exchange contract signed between the branch and the Daxing Yarn Factory in November of last year expired at the end of January this year, and the two parties immediately negotiated a new contract. After a long period of consultation, this contract was officially signed at the Textile Company on the 14th of this month. It stipulates that the effective period is from February 1 to December 31 of this year. In order to develop production, the branch also made appropriate adjustments to the exchange ratio on the basis of mutual benefit. For example, one piece of 20-count Double Happiness yarn exchanges for 625 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton (originally exchanged for 580 catties), one piece of 18-count yarn exchanges for 616 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton, one piece of 10-count yarn exchanges for 590.8 catties, one bolt of Deer Brand cloth exchanges for 24.038 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton, and one blanket exchanges for 3.632 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton.
    When the branch pays for raw cotton, it pays 425 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton for one piece of 20-count yarn according to the actual cotton consumption of the product, 420 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton for one piece of 18-count yarn, 414.8 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton for one piece of 10-count yarn, 13.15 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton for each bolt of Deer Brand cloth, and 2 catties of medium-grade standard raw cotton for each blanket; the remaining processing fee is paid at a price equivalent to 8.5 to 9 catties of millet per catty of raw cotton. If the cotton-millet price ratio is lower than 8.5 catties, the branch will still pay according to 8.5 catties; if it is higher than 9 catties, it will pay according to 9 catties. The contract also stipulates that the Textile Company branch must guarantee the standard of raw cotton and supply it on time, and the Daxing Yarn Factory must also guarantee the product specifications and standards and deliver the goods on time, so that production and sales can proceed smoothly according to the production and sales plans of both parties. If the product does not meet market supply and demand, the two parties can study and change the product type and quality in advance.

    【本报讯】花纱布公司石家庄分公司与石市大兴纱厂续订原棉交换成品合同，保证生产、推销的顺利进行。该分公司与大兴纱厂去年十一月订立的棉纱交换合同，于今年一月底期满后，双方即继续商订新合同。经过长时间的协商，此项合同已于本月十四日在花纱布公司正式签字。规定自本年二月一日至十二月三十一日为有效期间。该分公司为了发展生产，在两利的基础上并曾将交换比率作了适当调整。如二十支双福纱一件交换中级标准皮棉六二五斤（原交换五八○斤），十八支纱一件交换中级标准皮棉六一六斤，十支纱一件交换中级标准皮棉五九○·八市斤，山鹿布每匹交换中级标准皮棉二四·○三八市斤，绒毯每条交换中级标准皮棉三·六三二市斤。
