　　Self-Production Reduces the People's Burden
    PLA Units Begin Spring Plowing
    And Engage in River Digging, Land Reclamation, Road Construction, and Other Construction Work

    The People's Liberation Army units have successively commenced spring plowing and other production and construction work.

    A certain corps of the North China Military Region has prepared over 122,000 mu of land, estimated to yield over 21 million jin of millet. The entire corps has conducted inspections of production preparations and will formally commence cultivation after another general production review. In addition to agricultural production, this unit has also contributed over 1.79 million workdays to river digging projects and is engaged in sideline production. It is estimated that the three production activities—cultivation, river digging, and sideline production—can generate a net profit of over 30 million jin of millet. Individual units within the corps have already started production. A certain division has sown over 5,000 mu of spring wheat; a certain army's salt field has begun digging ditches. Production cooperatives in various units of the military region have organized soldiers with agricultural tool-making skills to participate in agricultural tool factories and production teams. After more than a month of research and improvement, work efficiency has been greatly improved. For example, a certain unit's ironworkers originally planned to produce 50 rake teeth per furnace per day, but now they can produce 80. In order to supply agricultural tools for spring plowing in a timely manner, the agricultural tool factories are actively rushing production.

    Units of the Bohai Military Region have sown over 13,000 mu of spring wheat in the silted land of the Yellow River downstream at Yangjiazui. In early February, the military region's guard regiment, training regiment, cavalry regiment, and parts of the supply department marched hundreds of li through wind and snow to the reclamation area. The land around Yangjiazui is fertile, but reeds grow everywhere, and the area is uninhabited for sixty li. After the officers and soldiers arrived, they enthusiastically launched a movement to cut reeds and clear the land. The guard regiment cut over 500,000 jin of reeds in eight days. In order not to miss the farming season, the officers and soldiers participating in reclamation continued to work hard cutting reeds and sowing seeds during the Spring Festival. The leaders of each unit took the lead in working in the fields. Political Commissar Xi Huating of the Cavalry Regiment led horses and held plows in the mud; Political Instructor Zhang Jucai of the Training Regiment's directly subordinate units personally boiled water and cooked food, carrying two large buckets of water to the fields. All tools and provisions had to be transported from the "rear" sixty li away, but the morale of the officers and soldiers remained extremely high. Each of them wrote their production plans on slips of paper pasted on their gun stocks, determined to turn the reed fields into a "Nanniwan," and expecting to harvest 1.3 million jin of grain in the summer harvest. The leaders of the military region specifically wrote letters to commend the troops participating in production.

    Units of the Pingyuan Military Region have started dike repair projects, while others have begun spring plowing. The Xinxiang Sub-district's directly subordinate units all went to work in the fields on the 7th, with the deputy political commissar and chief of staff also participating with their own tools. The Heze Sub-district, Liaocheng Sub-district, and Puyang Sub-district troops have all gone to the dikes to begin dike repair projects. The production personnel of the military region's political department have gone to Jiaozuo to mine limestone, preparing to burn lime. Before going to the fields, a certain regiment, by company, invited disaster-stricken farmers to recount their disaster experiences, further strengthening the officers' and soldiers' determination to engage in production and reduce the people's burden.

    The Suiyuan Military Region stipulated that two-thirds of each unit's personnel, one-half of the cavalry units' personnel, and one-third of the military and political organs' personnel should participate in production. Each person planting paddy fields must produce 600 jin of coarse grains per year, and those planting dry land must produce 360 jin. All units will soon begin spring plowing and sowing.

    The troops of the Chahar Military Region participating in the construction of the Sanggan River canal commenced work on the 20th of this month.

    A certain unit stationed in southern Xinjiang has begun spring plowing. Before launching the spring plowing movement, over 300 heroic model workers gathered to discuss how to strive for greater achievements in large-scale production. Yuan Ziying, a model worker from a certain regiment, has set a plan to reclaim 15 mu of wasteland this year and called on the entire squad to strive to become a model production squad.

    A certain unit stationed in Bachu County, Kashi District, southern Xinjiang, spent a month repairing the Honghai Reservoir, which had been manipulated and controlled by landlords and local bullies for many years and thus damaged, solving the long-standing water source problem for the county and enabling the military and civilians to obtain water for spring plowing in a timely manner.

    A certain division stationed in Guangdong has signed a contract with the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Administration to contract the repair of road switches and roadbeds at nine stations of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, totaling over 57,000 cubic meters of earthwork, agreeing on wages of 250,000 jin of rice, and commenced work on March 2nd. In addition, a certain division of the Northeast Military Region has also contributed 350,000 workdays to the construction of the Shenyang-Fushun highway and plans to contract the construction of 33 dormitories for the Fushun Mining Bureau between April and July.

　　自己生产减轻人民负担
    解放军各部开始春耕
    并从事挖河垦荒修路等建设工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】人民解放军各部已纷纷进行春耕和其他生产建设工作。
    华北军区某兵团，已准备好了土地十二万二千多亩，估计可收获小米二千一百万多斤。全兵团已进行了生产准备的检查工作，再举行一次生产大点验后即正式动工开垦。除农业生产外，该部还参加挖河工程一百七十九万多个工，并进行副业生产。据估计：耕地、挖河、副业等三项生产，可获纯利小米三千余万斤。该兵团个别单位已开始生产。某师已下种春麦五千余亩；某军的盐场已开始挖沟。军区各部队的生产合作社都组织了有制作农具技术的战士们参加农具厂和生产组，经过一个多月来的钻研、改进，工作效率大为提高。如某部铁工原计划一炉一天出产五十个耙齿，现在可以出到八十个。为了及时供应春耕农具，各农具厂都在积极赶制中。
    渤海军区各部，已在黄河下游杨家嘴黄河淤地播种春麦一万三千余亩。二月上旬，军区警卫团、教导团、骑兵团、供给部各一部，冒风雪行军数百里，前往垦种地区。杨家嘴一带土地肥沃，但遍地芦苇丛生，六十里内荒无人烟。各部指战员们抵达后，即热烈展开割苇出地运动，警卫团在八天内割芦苇五十多万斤。为了不误农时，参加垦荒的指战员们在春节中仍紧张地展开割苇播种。各部首长都带头下地工作。骑兵团政治委员席华亭在泥水中牵马扶犁；教导团直属队政治指导员张举材亲自烧水做饭，挑起两大桶水往地里送。一切工具、给养都要从六十里外的“后方”送上来，可是指战员们的情绪仍旧非常高涨。他们每个人写好生产计划贴在枪托上，决心要把芦苇地变成“南泥湾”，预计夏收时可以收获一百三十万斤粮食。军区首长特别写信嘉勉参加生产的部队。
    平原军区各部，一部分已开始修堤工程，一部分已进行春耕。新乡分区直属队，已于七日全部下地工作，副政治委员和参谋长也自带工具参加。荷泽分区、聊城分区、濮阳分区部队，都已上堤开始修堤工程。军区政治部生产人员已赴焦作开采石灰石，准备烧石灰。某团在下地前，以连为单位，请受灾农民讲述他们受灾情况，更加强了指战员们进行生产、减轻人民负担的决心。
    绥远军区规定各部以三分之二人员，骑兵部队以二分之一的人员，军政机关以三分之一的人员参加生产。种水地的每人每年要生产粗粮六百斤，种旱地的三百六十斤。各部即将进行春耕播种。
    察哈尔军区参加兴修桑乾河渠的部队，已于本月二十日开工。
    南疆驻军某部已开始春耕。该部于投入春耕运动前，三百余英雄模范工作者曾集会讨论如何在大生产中争取功上加功。某团模范工作者袁子英已订出今年开荒十五亩的计划，并号召全班争取当生产模范班。
    驻南疆喀什区巴楚县某部，以一个月的时间，把多年来被地主恶霸操纵把持因而损坏的红海水库修理好，解决了该县久悬未决的水源问题，使军民能及时获得春耕的用水。
    驻广东某师，已与广九铁路管理局订定合同，包修广九铁路九个站的路岔、路基，共五万七千多立方米土方，议定工资大米二十五万斤，已于三月二日动工。此外，东北军区某师，亦以三十五万个工参加沈阳至抚顺的公路建设，并拟于四月到七月间，包修抚顺矿务局的宿舍三十三栋。
