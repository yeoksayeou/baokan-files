[Comprehensive report from our newspaper] According to incomplete materials received up to mid-February, people's representative conferences have been held in all cities and counties of provinces or most cities and counties of provinces (cities with a population of more than 30,000) in the following areas: the six provinces of Northeast China and one administrative region; the five provinces of North China; the five provinces of East China (Shandong, Jiangsu (Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu), Zhejiang, Anhui (Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui), Fujian); the three provinces of Central South China (Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi); and the two provinces of Northwest China (Shaanxi, Gansu), totaling twenty-one provinces. Among them, the provinces in Northeast China generally held conferences throughout the province; most of the provinces in North China held conferences, such as Shanxi province, where only six counties have not yet convened, four of which are due to preparations for convening people's congresses; Hebei province has held conferences in 190 cities, counties, and towns, with cities and counties accounting for over 81% of the province's 146 cities and counties. Fujian, which was liberated relatively late, has also held conferences in more than 30 cities and counties, accounting for about half of the province's cities and counties of all sizes. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Wuhan, Kaifeng, Lanzhou, and other major cities in various provinces have held two or two sessions of conferences. District and village people's representative conferences or people's congresses have been held in Northeast China, Pingyuan, Chahar, Shandong, and other provinces; small and medium-sized cities and towns in Hebei province and most cities and counties in Henan have held two or two sessions of conferences. Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Guizhou are eight provinces where conferences have been partially held (materials from Inner Mongolia are incomplete and not included in the statistics). These provinces have first focused on holding conferences in larger cities and counties such as Changsha, Hengyang, Guangzhou, Guilin, Xining, Yinchuan, Dihua, Chongqing, Zigong, and Guiyang, and then gradually popularized them. The Northeast Administrative Region and cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhengzhou, because the masses have been basically organized, the representatives can more fully represent the broad masses of the people, the level of awareness of the masses is higher, and the counter-revolutionary elements have been basically eliminated, the people's representative conferences have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congresses, and elected administrative heads and city and county government members; Beijing held the Second Session of the Second People's Representative Conference in February, discussing and deciding on the government work plan and financial budget centered on restoring and developing production. Liaodong Province has held a Provincial People's Representative Conference. In addition, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Henan, and other three provinces are preparing to convene provincial people's representative conferences in the near future. The provinces in North China have decided to establish village, district, and county-level people's congresses or representative conferences this spring to elect village, district, and county-level people's governments. Shijiazhuang City held a formal people's congress in July last year, which was the first in the country. Yan'an has held a county people's congress, and other old areas in northern Shaanxi are preparing to convene them.
            "It's better to hold conferences than not to hold them, and it's better to hold them sooner than later"
    Through practical experience, leading cadres at all levels have deeply realized the great power of people's representative conferences in promoting work.
    After studying the CPPCC documents and the three general rules promulgated by the central government on convening people's representative conferences at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, especially after experiencing the first people's representative conferences, the people's governments and party leaders at all levels have deeply realized the importance of promoting the completion of various tasks through people's representative conferences. For example, Shandong Province said in summarizing the experience of people's representative conferences in various counties throughout the province: "The serious and responsible attitude of the representatives in the conference, the active provision of opinions, and the resolution of problems have educated the cadres, and the leaders have a new understanding, feeling that this kind of meeting can solve problems better than general cadre meetings, and truly understanding the principle of 'it is better to hold conferences than not to hold them, and it is better to hold them sooner than later.'" After a county in Pingyuan Province held a representative conference, district cadres conveyed the burden method of autumn grain requisition. The masses felt it was too heavy and had opinions on the difference between it and neighboring villages. However, after the representatives explained with specific harvest figures and geological conditions, the villagers understood that it was "not much" and "fair." All of this deeply educated the staff. Therefore, most areas have established the convening of people's representative conferences as a system, and the Northwest Region and Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and other provinces convened people's representative conferences in larger cities and counties within one or two months after liberation.
            Representatives are more broadly composed, and preparations are more adequate
    The composition of representatives attending people's representative conferences in various places is more extensive. For example, various counties in Shanxi have increased representatives of martyrs, soldiers, and workers' families, representatives of demobilized soldiers, and enlightened gentry; in addition to model workers and labor models, specially invited representatives also include individual former landlords and rich peasants who have participated in labor, changed their composition, and performed well in various tasks, as well as middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against. Jinan City added 177 specially invited representatives when it held the second conference, which was almost double the original 192 representatives. Beijing also added more than 120 people at the second conference, accounting for slightly less than two-fifths of the original number of representatives. Chahar Province paid more attention to the distribution of representative quotas, and the provincial government specifically stipulated that women representatives should account for no less than about one-fifth of the total number of representatives. In Northeast China, worker and peasant representatives generally do not exceed 30% to 40%, in order to facilitate the participation of representatives from other strata and occupations. At the same time, attention was paid to inviting representatives with specific and special representativeness in different regions. For example, the Northwest convened people's representative conferences from all ethnic groups and sectors, Xiamen specially invited representatives of overseas Chinese, and coastal provinces such as Fujian and Zhejiang had representatives of salt workers and fishermen. In the production of representatives, the proportion of representatives elected and recommended by groups has also increased in the total number of representatives, such as in Beijing, which accounts for about 70%. But on the other hand, attention was also paid to the review of representatives. Taiyuan City replaced unqualified representatives at the request of the masses; Jiangling County in Hubei Province cleaned up Kuomintang agents who impersonated representatives in a cautious review; and Yuanzhou Sub-district in Jiangxi Province adopted the method of mutual review by representatives. This strengthened the representatives' sense of responsibility and attention to people's representative conferences.
    Preparations before the meeting have been more adequate. Before convening people's representative conferences, various places in Northeast China and various counties in Shandong convened joint meetings of district chiefs to better report on work and prepare for the meeting; Hang County in Zhejiang Province thoroughly studied the experience of the Songjiang People's Representative Conference before the meeting; various places in Northeast China and North China held various symposiums before the meeting to discuss work and collect opinions; Henan and Lushun-Dalian and other places also used various methods to carry out propaganda and education on the nature and tasks of people's representative conferences, who should be selected as representatives, what representatives should do, etc.; Hanyang and other counties in Hubei Province first convened farmer representative conferences, and Chahar Province and Beijing and other places first convened party representative conferences as preparations before convening people's representative conferences.
    Many local governments pay great attention to listening to the voices of the masses at people's representative conferences. According to statistics from materials from various places, the masses are most concerned about production. They expressed warm support for the production policies of the Communist Party and the people's government, and worker and peasant representatives scrambled to report on production achievements at the meeting. According to 2,879 proposals from people's representative conferences in 20 counties and cities in the three special districts of Changzhi, Fenyang, and Yuci in Shanxi Province, production and construction accounted for 764 items, cultural education accounted for 549 items, burden and taxation accounted for 346 items, and preferential treatment for military families and substitute farming accounted for 227 items, with production and construction and cultural education being the most numerous. This shows the strong economic and cultural demands of the liberated people (especially after rent reduction and land reform).
    The obvious facts point out that people's representative conferences are the most effective weapon for uniting the people and implementing various policies. For example, Zhangjiakou City took the lead in the country in completing the public bond task and announced its victory to the whole country. Hangzhou City followed up and overfulfilled the task. People's representative conferences played a considerable role. Major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Changsha, and Taiyuan have solved complex labor-capital relations, municipal construction, rent and housing rights, taxation, and other issues through people's representative conferences. Small and medium-sized cities, counties, and towns have solved the problems of urban-rural trade, winter production, land reform, double reduction, bandit suppression, and anti-hegemony. After the people's representative conference in Changsha, business people who were scattered in Hong Kong and Guiyang and other places returned one after another, and some brought back a large number of raw materials. In Taiyuan, less than a month after the second conference, more than 200 private industrial and commercial enterprises were added, and the collection of industrial and commercial taxes was fully paid within five days.

　　团结各界广大人民贯彻执行各项政策
    二十一省大部县市开过人民代表会议
    另有八省较大城市重点召开逐渐推广
    【本报综合报道】根据截至二月中旬为止所收到的不完全的材料，现在全省各市县或全省的大部分市县（三万以上人口的城市）已开过各界人民代表会议的，计有东北六省，一行署区；华北五省；华东的山东、江苏（苏南、苏北）、浙江、安徽（皖南、皖北）、福建五省；中南区的河南、湖北、江西；西北区的陕西、甘肃等共二十一个省。其中东北区的各省一般的都是全省开过；华北各省则是绝大部分开过，如山西全省仅有六个县尚未召开，其中有四个县还是因为要筹开人民代表大会的缘故；河北省已有一百九十个市县镇开过，其中市县占全省一百四十六个市县的百分之八十一强。解放比较晚的福建也有三十余市县开过，约占全省大小市县的一半。京、津、沪、宁、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、唐山、太原、张垣、济南、武汉、开封、兰州等及其他各省的大城市均已开过二次或二届会议。东北各地和平原、察哈尔、山东等省则已开过区村人民代表会议或人民代表大会；河北省的中小城市和市镇及河南的大部市县，均已开过二次或二届会议。全省部分开过的有湖南、广东、广西、青海、宁夏、新疆和四川、贵州等八个省（内蒙材料不全，未统计在内），这些省份，都在较大的城市如长沙、衡阳、广州、桂林、西宁、银川、迪化、重庆、自贡、贵阳等市县先重点召开，逐渐普及。东北行政区及北京、天津、唐山、郑州等市，因为群众已基本上组织了起来，代表们已能更充分地代表广大的人民，群众的觉悟程度较高和反革命分子已被基本上肃清，各界人民代表会议就执行了人民代表大会的职权，选举了行政首长和市县政府委员；北京市在二月间召开了二届二次会议，讨论并决定了以恢复与发展生产为中心的政府工作计划与财政概算。辽东省已开省人民代表会议。此外筹备在最近召开省人民代表会议的有黑龙江、山东、河南等三省。华北各省决定在今春建立村、区、县三级人民代表大会或代表会议，选举村、区、县三级人民政府。石家庄市已在去年七月召开了正式的人民代表大会，这在全国是第一次。延安已开过县人民代表大会、陕北其他老区均在筹备召开。
            “开比不开好，早开比晚开好”
    各级领导干部经过实际体验，深刻认识了人民代表会议推动工作的巨大力量。
    各级人民政府和党的领导同志，在学习了政协文件及中央颁布的关于召开省市县各界人民代表会议三个通则，特别是经过第一次各界人民代表会议的体验之后，都深刻地认识了通过各界代表会议推动完成各项工作的重要性。如山东省在总结全省各县人民代表会议经验中说：“在会议中代表的严肃负责的态度，积极的提供意见，解决问题，教育了干部，领导上有了新的认识，感到这种会比一般干部会能解决问题，切实的领会了‘开比不开好，早开比晚开好’的道理”。平原省某县在开过代表会后，区干部传达了秋征的负担办法，群众觉得太重，且对与邻村之间的差额有意见；可是等代表以具体收成数字，地质好坏做说明以后，村民才明白了原来是“不多的”、“公平的”。所有这些都深深的教育了工作人员。因此大部分地区都把召开各界人民代表会议订成制度，西北区和四川、贵州、广东等省则在解放后一两月之后就召集了较大市县的各界人民代表会议。
            代表成份更加广泛  准备工作亦较充分
    各地出席各界人民代表会议的代表，成份是更加广泛了。如山西各县都增加了烈、军、工属代表，荣军代表和开明士绅；特邀代表除英模与劳模外还特聘了个别已经参加劳动，改变了成份，并在各种工作上表现较好的原地主富农，及误斗中农等作代表。济南市在开第二次会议时增聘代表百七十七名，与原有代表百九十二名比较，差不多增加了一倍。北京第二届会议时也增加了一百二十余人，约当原代表数的五分之二弱。察省更注意了代表名额的分配问题，省府特别规定妇女代表应不少于全数代表的五分之一左右。东北各地工农代表一般不超过百分之三十到四十，以便于吸收其他各阶层职业代表参加。同时在不同地区注意了聘请具体特殊代表性的代表，如西北召开的是各族各界人民代表会议，厦门特聘侨胞代表，福建、浙江等沿海各省有盐民、渔民代表。在代表的产生上，团体选举与推选的代表，在全体代表中的比例也增多了，如北京约占百分之七十。但另一方面也注意了代表的审查工作，太原市通过群众的要求撤换了不称职的代表；湖北江陵县则在慎重审查中清洗了冒充代表的国民党特务；江西袁州分区更采取了代表相互审查的办法。这加强了代表的责任心与对各界人民代表会议的重视。
    开会前的准备工作均已较为充分。东北各地和山东各县在开各界人民代表会议以前分别召开区长联席会，以便更好地报告工作及准备会议的进行；浙江杭县在开会前，干部都详尽地研究了松江各界人民代表会议的经验；东北及华北各地会前召开各种各界座谈会，讨论工作，搜集意见；河南和旅大等地并利用各种方式进行各界人民代表会议的性质、任务，选什么人当代表，代表们做些什么等等的宣传教育；湖北汉阳等县，先召开了农民代表会议，察哈尔省和北京等地均先开了党的代表会，作为召开各界人民代表会议前的准备工作。
    很多地方政府十分注意在各界人民代表会议上倾听群众呼声。据各地材料统计，群众最关心的是生产。对于共产党和人民政府的生产方针表示热烈拥护，工农代表在会上抢着报告生产成绩。据山西省长治、汾阳、榆次三个专区二十个县、市的各界人民代表会议二千八百七十九件提案中，生产建设即占七六四件，文化教育为五四九件，负担税收三四六件，优属代耕二二七件，其中以生产建设与文化教育为最多。表示解放了的人民（特别是经过减租及土改）在经济上和文化上的强烈要求。
    显明的事实指出：各界人民代表会议是团结人民贯彻执行各项政策的最有效的武器。如张家口市在完成公债任务上以全国第一名向全国告捷，杭州市继起超额完成任务，各界人民代表会议是起了相当大的作用。京、津、沪、长沙、太原各大城市都是通过了各界人民代表会议解决了复杂的劳资关系、市政建设、房租房权、税收等问题。中小市、县、镇解决了城乡贸易问题、冬季生产及土改、双减、剿匪、反霸等问题。长沙在各界人民代表会议以后散住香港和贵阳等地的工商界人士都陆续归来，有的并带回大批原料。太原在二届会议后，不到一月私营工商业增加二百余家，工商税的征收在五天中全部交齐。
