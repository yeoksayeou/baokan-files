　　Overcoming Serious Closed-Doorism Tendencies
　　Half of Shandong Workers Organized
　　Over 120,000 Trained and Educated
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th) Currently, 54% of workers in Shandong province have been organized. In major cities such as Qingdao, Jinan, and Yantai, over 80% of industrial workers are organized. Currently, there are over 286,000 union members in Shandong province, belonging to 48 industrial unions. The development of trade union work in Shandong Province has occurred during the struggle to overcome closed-doorism. In the early stages of the liberation of various cities, serious closed-doorism tendencies occurred in trade union organization work: trade union cadres lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of organizing workers, fearing that the trade union would be controlled and used by bad elements after it was organized. Therefore, overly harsh conditions were imposed on the admission of members. For example, when the Jinan Brewing Factory admitted members, it checked their historical composition and ideology, and the requirements for a member were even higher than for a Communist Party member. In Jiao County, before September of last year, out of more than 1,100 workers in the county, there were less than 100 union members. In Xin Hailian and Jining, for a period of time, the scope of membership development was limited to manual laborers, and clerks and shop assistants were not admitted. Although the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee's urban work conference in April last year and the Shandong trade union leading cadres' conference in July had strictly criticized the above-mentioned closed-doorism tendencies, the spirit of the conference was not well implemented in various places. It was not until the provincial trade union work conference was held in early September, and the national trade union work conference's policy of basically organizing the national working class within one year was conveyed and discussed, that cadres in various places strictly criticized their past erroneous thinking and working methods, and took organizational development as the center, so that the province's trade union organization work developed faster than at any time in the past. After joining trade union organizations, many workers have made great contributions in saving raw materials, improving tools, and improving technology. For example, workers at the Jinan Railway Factory used scrap materials from damaged vehicles to renovate a "New China" locomotive. After the Xinbo Coal Mine trade union launched a production competition, the daily output per worker increased from 0.7101 tons to 1.04 tons. There have been as many as 120 technical improvement incidents in various factories of the Qingdao China Textile Construction Company. The average output of each factory has now exceeded 25% before liberation.
　　With the development of trade union organizations, the work of educating workers has also been valued by the trade unions. Last year, various places held a total of 89 training courses for employees, training more than 21,000 activists; 12 employee schools were held, with a total of more than 3,500 students. In addition, large classes, night schools, literacy classes, etc. were also held in various places. According to statistics, a total of more than 124,000 employees in the province have received education.
　　Labor insurance and welfare facilities for workers have also begun to be organized. Some places have established labor insurance committees, depositing labor insurance funds according to the employee's salary income, and handling a number of employee injuries, illnesses, disabilities, deaths, and other issues. The sanitary equipment of many factories and mines has also begun to be improved. There are now 262 cooperatives, 50 hospitals and clinics, 71 public canteens, and 123 bathhouses established throughout the province.

　　克服严重关门主义偏向
    山东工人半数组织起来
    经训练教育的达十二万余人
    【新华社济南二十五日电】山东全省现已有百分之五十四的工人组织起来；各主要城市如青岛、济南、烟台等地的产业工人，组织起来的则达百分之八十以上。现全省工会会员有二十八万六千多人，分属于四十八个产业工会中。山东省工会工作是在克服关门主义的斗争中发展起来的。各城市相继解放初期，工会组织工作曾发生过严重的关门主义偏向：工会干部对于把工人组织起来的重要性认识不够，怕工会组织起来后被坏分子把持利用。因此对会员的吸收提出过苛的条件。如济南酿造厂吸收会员时要查他的历史成份和思想，甚至对一个会员的要求比对共产党员还要高。胶县在去年九月以前，全县一千一百余名工人中，工会会员还不满一百人；新海连、济宁两市有一个时期发展会员的范围只限于体力劳动的工人，对于职员、店员概不吸收。虽然去年四月的中共中央山东分局城市工作会议和七月的山东各地工会主要干部会议曾对上述关门主义的偏向作过严格的批评，但各地工会工作并未很好地贯彻会议精神。直到九月初全省工会工作会议召开，并传达和讨论了全国工会工作会议关于在一年以内把全国工人阶级基本上组织起来的方针以后，各地干部们才对过去错误的思想和工作方法作了严格的批判，并以发展组织为中心，使全省工会组织工作有了较以往任何时期为快的发展。许多工人在加入工会组织后，在节省原料、改良工具、提高技术等方面曾有很大的贡献。如济南铁路大厂工人利用破车废料装修成了一部“新中国号”机车。新博煤矿工会发动生产竞赛以后，工人日产量已由零点七一零一吨增至一点零四顿。青岛中国纺织建设公司各厂改进技术的事件，已有一百二十起之多。目前各厂的生产量平均已超过解放前百分之二十五。
    随着工会组织的发展，教育工人的工作也为工会重视起来。去年各地共举办了职工训练班八十九期，培养积极分子二万一千余名；举办职工学校十二期，学员共达三千五百余人。此外，各地并举办大课、夜校、识字班等。据统计，全省已受教育的职工，共有十二万四千余人。
    工人的劳动保险和福利设施亦已开始举办。有些地方已建立劳动保险委员会，按职工薪给所得提存劳动保险基金，并处理了若干职工伤、病、残废、死亡等问题。许多厂、矿的卫生设备亦已开始改进。全省现已建立合作社二百六十二所，医院、诊疗所五十所，公共食堂七十一间，澡塘一百二十三处。
