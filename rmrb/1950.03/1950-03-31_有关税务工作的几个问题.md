　　Several Questions Regarding Tax Work

　　(1) The original Business Tax and Income Tax were two independent tax laws. Why are they combined into one tax law?

　　Answer: In order to implement the "simplification of the tax system" stipulated in the Common Program, we must simplify tax types and tax items, simplify collection procedures, and increase convenience for taxpayers. Therefore, the above two taxes, as well as the former Special Business Tax, Temporary Income Tax, Business Firm Tax, and Stall License Tax, are all incorporated into one tax law.

　　The nature of Income Tax and Business Tax is different. Business Tax is levied on turnover – total sales revenue or total revenue from labor and credit. Income Tax is levied on the amount of income – net income after deducting various expenses. Originally, they should be written as two tax laws. However, in the current stage after liberation, due to objective conditions, account auditing has not yet been universally implemented, and most areas still adopt the method of democratic assessment. It is not possible, and currently unnecessary, to divide them into two tax laws. Because: (1) the subject of taxation is all profit-making enterprises; (2) turnover and income are linked, and to find out the income, you must first know the turnover; (3) the investigation and registration of industrial and commercial households can be done once and used for two types of tax calculation; (4) the accounts on which the two types of tax calculation are based are the same accounts; (5) the chambers of commerce and trade associations that use democratic assessment are also the same set, not two sets; (6) separate calculation, combined collection, the taxpayer has the same qualifications, and the collecting treasury also has the same qualifications. It is possible to arrange them at the same time, which is very convenient for taxpayers.

　　(2) Since the two taxes are merged into one tax law, why not cancel one of them? Or add the tax rate of one tax to the tax rate of the other, wouldn't it be simpler and easier?

　　Answer: In the current stage of guaranteeing the supply for the revolutionary war, it is not allowed to cancel one of them. As for raising the tax rate, it is also unreasonable. If the tax rate for income calculation is increased and the Business Tax is cancelled, the result will be no tax for those with no income, and less tax for those with less income. How can this guarantee supply? Therefore, it is necessary to use business calculation to coordinate. If the Income Tax is cancelled and only the tax rate for business calculation is raised, the burden on industry and commerce would be too heavy, and it would also be unreasonable, so it is necessary to use income calculation to coordinate. In summary, it is necessary to include the functions of two types of tax calculation in one tax law. (Excerpt from Tax Work Research)

　　有关税务工作的几个问题
    （一）原来的营业税及所得税，本是各自独立的两个税法，为什么并成一个税法？
    答：为了执行共同纲领所规定的“简化税制”，我们要简化税种税目，要简化征课手续，为纳税人增加便利，所以将以上两个税以及从前的特种营业税、一时所得税、行商税、摊贩牌照税等，俱并入一个税法。
    所得税和营业税，两个税的性质，本来不同。营业税是对营业额——销货总收入或劳务信用总收益——征课的。所得税是对所得额——除去各种开支的纯所得——征课的。本来应该写成两个税法。但在解放后的现阶段，受了客观条件的限制，尚未能普遍查帐，大多地区仍采用民主评议的方式，是不能、而且目前不必要分成两个税法。因为：（一）纳税的主体都是营利事业；（二）营业额和所得额是连着的，欲求所得额，必先晓得营业额；（三）工商业户的调查登记，办一次，即可供两个计税之用；（四）两种计税所要根据的帐，就是同一的帐；（五）运用民主评议的商会及同业公会，也是同一套而不是两套；（六）分别计算，合并征收，纳税人是同一资格，收款的公库也是同一资格，可能凑在同一时期，一道办理，对纳税人是很方便的。
    （二）两个税既合并为一个税法，为什么不取消一个？或是把这一个税的税率，加在那一个税的税率里边，岂不更省事、更简化？
    答：在今天保障革命战争供给的现阶段，是不容取消其中的一个的。至于提高税率，也不合理。如果提高所得计税的税率而取消营业税，其结果，无所得者不征，所得少的少征，又怎能保障供给呢？所以要拿营业计税来配合。如果将所得税取消，光是提高营业计税的税率，那对于工商业的负担，就太重了，而且也不合理，所以要拿所得计税来配合。总起来讲，就是要在一个税法之中，包括两种计税的作用。（摘自税工研究）
