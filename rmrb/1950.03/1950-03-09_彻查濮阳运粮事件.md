Thoroughly Investigate the Puyang Grain Transport Incident

The Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Puyang Party Committee of the CCP in Pingyuan Province committed serious errors in the grain transport work last winter, causing great losses to the grain-transporting farmers, and greatly damaging the prestige of the local people's government and the Party among the people.

This error is not a general error or shortcoming, but a serious error of principle. This incident first shows that the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the local CCP Committee did not seriously consider what they should be doing at present? What is the local central task? The grain transport work was the central task at that time, and they did not pay attention to this work, which shows their lack of a national financial perspective. Public grain has always been and still is one of the most important sources of income for our national finance. Without such a large amount of public grain income, it would be impossible to support our government's large amount of financial expenditure. Speaking of the grain issue itself, whether in wartime or peacetime, grain is a top priority. In order to ensure the supply of grain throughout the country this year, the relevant agencies of the Central People's Government are making great efforts. Pingyuan Province is one of the four major disaster areas in the country this year, and the grain supply in Pingyuan Province is of great concern to the relevant departments. The local government and Party workers should cherish grain even more. However, the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the local CCP Committee have so neglected the grain work, which can only be explained by their great neglect of national finance and people's lives.

Second, this incident also shows that they particularly lack a mass perspective and have serious bureaucracy. For such a complex and meticulous grain transport work, they did not seriously and conscientiously carry out specific organization. When the Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a grain transport meeting, neither the Commissioner nor the Party Committee participated. The arrangements for grain transport work were also very general and hasty. For example, they only notified "complete the delivery in two batches" without carefully preparing all aspects of the grain transport work. For example, the grain receiving cadres, weighing tools, grain receiving time, traffic conditions, and accommodation stations for people, animals, and fodder were not carefully arranged, resulting in phenomena such as no one receiving grain, slow weighing, and overcrowded grain carts with no place to stay, thus causing the death of people and animals. The farmers have fulfilled their due responsibility for paying and transporting public grain, but our government and Party workers are indifferent to them, failing to consider their difficulties from their perspective and specifically help them overcome these difficulties, as if these are all "small matters" and not worth their attention. This bureaucratic attitude has nothing in common with the kind of cordial concern that Communist Party members and people's government workers should have for the working people.

Third, they also lack a spirit of self-criticism. Several months have passed since the incident, and they have not yet made a profound review. Comrade Li Lige, Deputy Commissioner of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, even said that "lack of training" was the reason for the large-scale death of grain-transporting livestock. What kind of "theory" is this? Does it mean that grain-transporting farmers and livestock should be "trained" by being exposed to the icy and snowy weather? Should farmers and livestock who died due to lack of grass and fodder and exposure to the icy and snowy weather be criticized for "lack of training"? No! The ones who truly "lack training" are not others, but these comrades who made mistakes themselves! They extremely lack the training of self-criticism.

It should be pointed out that the People's Government of Pingyuan Province and the Provincial Party Committee of the CCP bear a certain responsibility for the Puyang incident. They should conscientiously and responsibly thoroughly investigate the Puyang grain transport incident, and the responsible personnel mainly related to this incident should conduct public self-criticism among the masses and in the newspapers. Those who seriously violate the interests of the masses must be appropriately punished and discipline must be resolutely enforced. An apology should be made to the affected masses and their losses should be appropriately compensated.

### 彻查濮阳运粮事件

　　彻查濮阳运粮事件
    平原省濮阳专署与中共濮阳地委在去冬运送公粮工作中犯了严重的错误，使运粮农民受到了很大损失，因而也大大地损害了当地人民政府与党在人民群众中的威信。
    这一错误，不是一般性质的错误或缺点，而是严重的带原则性的错误。这一事件，首先表示濮阳专署和该地中共地委没有认真地考虑他们当前应当作些什么？当地中心工作是些什么？运送公粮工作就是当时当地的中心工作，他们没有重视这一工作，就表示他们缺乏国家财政的观点。公粮从来是而且现在也仍然是我们国家财政最主要的收入之一。没有这样大量的公粮收入，就不可能支持我们政府这样大量的财政支出。单就粮食问题本身说，无论在战时或平时，粮食都是一个头等重要的问题。为了保证今年全国粮食的供应，中央人民政府各有关机关正从事巨大的努力。平原省是今年全国四大重灾区之一，平原省的粮食供应，甚为有关部门所注意。当地政府与党的工作人员更应当珍视粮食。而濮阳专署与该地中共地委竟如此忽视公粮工作，除了表示他们十分忽视国家财政与人民生活而外，不能有其他解释。
    第二，这一事件又表示他们特别缺乏群众观点，存在着严重的官僚主义。对于这样复杂细致的运粮工作，他们并没有严肃认真地进行具体的组织。专署召开运粮会议时，专员、地委都未参加。布置运粮工作，又十分笼统草率。如只是通知“分两批交完”，而没有仔细将运粮工作的各个环节，妥为准备。如收粮干部、过秤工具、收粮时间、交通条件、人畜草料宿站等均未周详安排，以致发生无人收粮、过秤太慢、粮车拥挤无处住宿等现象，因而造成人畜的死亡。农民们对于交纳与运送公粮已尽了他们应有的责任，而我们政府与党的工作人员对于他们却漠不关心，没有设身处地地考虑他们的困难，并具体帮助他们克服这些困难，似乎这些都是“小事”，不值得他们一顾。这种官僚主义的态度，与共产党员和人民政府工作人员对待劳动人民应有的那种亲切关怀的态度，毫无共同之点。
    第三，他们还极端缺乏自我批评精神。事件经过了几个月，他们还未作深刻检讨。该专署副专员李立格同志竟至于说：“牲口缺少锻炼”是造成运粮牲口大批死亡的原因。这是什么“理论”呢？难道说，运粮的农民和牲畜，应当受露宿冰天雪地的“锻炼”吗？因为缺草缺料与露宿冰天雪地而死亡的农民和牲畜还应当被批评为“缺少锻炼”么？不是的！真正“缺少锻炼”的，不是别人，而正是这些犯错误的同志自己！他们极端缺乏自我批评的锻炼。
    应当指出：平原省的人民政府和中共省党委对于濮阳事件是负有一定责任的。他们应当认真负责地彻查濮阳运粮事件，应当使与这次事件主要有关的负责人员，在群众中、在报纸上公开进行自我批评。对严重违犯群众利益的分子必须适当处分，坚决执行纪律。对受害群众应进行道歉并适当地补偿他们的损失。
