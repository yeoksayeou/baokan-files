　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th: The Beijing Office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League held a "February 28th" third anniversary commemoration meeting at the Beijing Hotel this afternoon. Approximately 600 representatives from various parties and Taiwanese compatriots in Beijing attended. The meeting proceeded in a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the entire assembly stood in silent tribute to the "February 28th" martyrs. Subsequently, Lin Kengsheng, a member of the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, delivered the opening address, and Guo Zhaolie, a member of the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, reported on the course of the "February 28th" uprising. Guo Zhaolie said: The heroic "February 28th" uprising, caused by the Kuomintang bandit gang's cruel oppression and massacre of the Taiwanese people, is a part of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. Although it suffered setbacks due to the bloody suppression by the Kuomintang reactionaries, it educated the Taiwanese people to recognize the true face of the Kuomintang bandit gang and American imperialism, educated the Taiwanese people on how to conduct the struggle, and pointed out the bright road to thorough liberation. He emphasized that the liberation of Taiwan is a part of the Chinese people's liberation cause. It is inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Only under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can Taiwan achieve thorough liberation.

　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army took the stage to speak amidst enthusiastic applause, which made everyone particularly excited. Commander-in-Chief Zhu pointed out: The current situation is fundamentally different from the situation at the time of "February 28th." The People's Liberation War has achieved a decisive victory, and the Chinese mainland, except for Tibet, has been completely liberated. The liberation of Taiwan is also imminent. The task of the Taiwanese people today is to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "February 28th," accumulate strength, so that when the time comes, they can actively assist the People's Liberation Army in crushing the enemy and completing the liberation of Taiwan. At present, American imperialism is continuing to actively aid the remaining Chiang bandit gang with military weapons, etc., using the ships and planes they gave to the Chiang bandits to blockade the coast, bomb our major cities, sabotage the peaceful life of the Chinese people and the construction of New China, and conspire to turn Taiwan into their base of aggression. Therefore, liberating Taiwan has become the most urgent task of the people of the whole country today and must be completed with all our strength. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: Although there are difficulties in liberating Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army is absolutely confident in completing this sacred task. It is hoped that the compatriots of Taiwan, the revolutionaries of Taiwan, all Kuomintang officers and soldiers in Taiwan who still have patriotism and are willing to atone for their crimes, will take courageous actions at that time to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in order to win the final victory of the People's Liberation War.

　　发扬革命精神彻底解放台湾！
    首都集会纪念“二·二八”       
    朱总司令说：我军绝对有把握完成解放台湾的神圣任务，望台胞勇敢配合行动。
    【新华社北京二十八日电】台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处今日下午假北京饭店举行“二·二八”三周年纪念大会。到各方代表及旅京台胞约六百余人。大会在严肃而兴奋的气氛中进行。宣布开会后，全体肃立向“二·二八”烈士静默致哀，继由台湾民主自治同盟总部委员林铿生致开会辞，台湾民主自治同盟总部委员郭照烈报告“二·二八”起义经过。郭照烈说：由于国民党匪帮对台湾人民的残酷压榨与屠杀所引起的“二·二八”英勇起义，是中国人民解放斗争的一部分。它虽因国民党反动派的血腥镇压而遭受挫折，但它教育了台湾人民认清了国民党匪帮和美帝国主义的面貌，教育台湾人民应如何进行斗争，并指出了获得彻底解放的光明大道。他最后强调指出，台湾的解放是中国人民解放事业的一部分，它是离不开中国共产党领导的，只有在中国共产党的正确领导下，台湾才能获得彻底解放。
    中国人民解放军朱总司令在热烈掌声中登台讲话，他的讲话使大家特别兴奋。朱总司令指出：现在的情况已经与“二·二八”当时的情况根本不同了，人民解放战争已取得决定性胜利，中国大陆除西藏外已全部解放，台湾的解放亦已为期不远。台湾人民今天的任务就是继续发扬“二·二八”的革命精神，积蓄力量，以便在时机到时，积极协助人民解放军粉碎敌人，完成台湾的解放。目前美帝国主义正继续以军火武器等积极援助台湾蒋匪残余，用他们送给蒋匪的舰船和飞机封锁海岸、轰炸我各大城市，破坏中国人民的和平生活与新中国建设事业，并阴谋变台湾为其侵略基地。因此，解放台湾就成为全国人民今天最紧要的任务，必须用全力来完成。朱总司令说：解放台湾虽有困难，但人民解放军绝对有把握完成这一神圣任务。希望台湾的同胞、台湾的革命者、一切在台湾的尚有爱国心及愿意将功折罪的国民党官兵，届时能以勇敢的行动，配合人民解放军，以便取得人民解放战争最后一战的胜利。
