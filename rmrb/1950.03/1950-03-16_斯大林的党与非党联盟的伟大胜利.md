Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: The Pravda published an editorial on the 15th titled "The Great Victory of Stalin's Party and Non-Party Alliance," stating:

    The statement and list of representatives of the Central Election Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding the results of the voting on March 12, 1950, demonstrate the great victory of Stalin's Party and Non-Party Alliance. The election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was held nationwide amidst a huge patriotic upsurge and political enthusiasm of the people and movingly proved the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people. The candidates nominated by the Party and Non-Party Alliance have won a great victory. The scale and level of political enthusiasm of the broadest masses in this Supreme Soviet election campaign are unparalleled. More than 111 million voters went to the polls. In history, no party other than our Bolshevik Party, and no government other than our Soviet government, has ever received such unanimous support and such concentrated votes of confidence from the entire people. Social history has never known such high political enthusiasm and such united will as expressed in the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: 99.98 percent of all voters in the country participated in the election; 99.73 percent of the voters participating in the election of representatives to the Soviet of the Union, and 99.72 percent of the voters participating in the election of representatives to the Soviet of Nationalities, voted for the candidates of Stalin's Party and Non-Party Alliance. How moving and persuasive these figures are! These figures show that the supreme state power organ of the Soviet Union is based on the single will of the entire Soviet people, and that the entire Soviet people are closely united around their own Bolshevik Party, and united around the great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin. The results of the Supreme Soviet election provide new and moving evidence that the Soviet social system and state system are superior to any non-Soviet social system and state system.

    There has never been such social unity as the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, a unity formed under the victorious banner of the increasingly powerful Lenin-Stalin Party. This spiritually and politically inviolable unity is only possible in a society where socialism has triumphed and the exploiting classes have been eliminated.

    The results of the Supreme Soviet election once again demonstrate that only socialism can guarantee genuine democracy for the people, and only under socialism are the people the true masters of their own destiny.

    What can the hired singers of capitalist false democracy use to counter the greatest activeness of the working people in Soviet socialist society? What democracy can there be for laborers in capitalist countries, where millions of people suffer the terror of unemployment and die from hunger and poverty! Today, in capitalist countries, an increasingly broad mass of working people are beginning to realize that the much-vaunted bourgeois democracy is nothing but a complete deception. They are beginning to understand the greatness of the genuine, people's, socialist democracy that flourishes in the Soviet Union.

    The results of the Supreme Soviet election most vividly demonstrate the great inspiring and organizing activity of the great Lenin-Stalin Party, and demonstrate its inseparable connection with the people. The Soviet people unanimously voted for the alliance of Stalin's Party and non-Party people, thereby expressing their love and infinite loyalty to the Communist Party and the great Stalin.

    Comrade Stalin said: "The Communist Party is not isolated in the election campaign. It participates in the election campaign in alliance with non-Party people." Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Soviet social system unites non-Party people and Communists into a common collective organization of the Soviet people. In this collective organization, they fight side by side to consolidate our country's strength, they fight and shed blood side by side on all fronts for freedom, for the greatness of our motherland, and they also forge victory side by side, enabling our country to defeat the enemy. In our country, the Party and non-Party people are engaged in a common cause. This is why the alliance of the Party and non-Party people is natural and of utmost importance.

    The strength of the Stalin Party and Non-Party Alliance, which won a new glorious victory in the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections, lies in its uniting workers, peasants and intellectuals under the leadership of the Communist Party. This alliance is the foundation of our victory and the guarantee of the Soviet Union's greater achievements. The Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union expressed its belief in its appeal to voters that all voters would once again unanimously elect the candidates nominated by the Communist Party together with non-Party people to the Soviet Supreme Soviet, and would once again demonstrate their supreme trust in the Party of Lenin and Stalin. The appeal to voters said: "The Communist Party expects and relies on this trust and support from the voters, because the Soviet people have, through years of experience, confirmed the correctness of the Party's policy which is consistent with the vital interests of the people. All activities of the Party are selfless service to the people; for the Party, there is no interest higher than the interests of the people."

    Our entire people unanimously voted for the candidates of the alliance of Stalin's Party and non-Party people, thereby responding to the call of the Party of Lenin and Stalin with great patriotic enthusiasm. The Soviet people declared that the policy of the Bolshevik Party is their policy, declared that they wholeheartedly trust the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and are ready to advance towards the victory of communism under its leadership.

    The entire Soviet people voting for the candidates of the Party and Non-Party Alliance is voting in favor of maintaining the strength and freedom of the socialist country, and maintaining the powerful and invincible nature of our Soviet country. The Soviet people voting for the candidates of the Party and Non-Party Alliance is also voting in favor of the further great improvement of socialist industry, agriculture, and culture, and the further improvement of the living standards of our people.

    The Soviet people voting for the candidates of the Party and Non-Party Alliance is also voting in favor of the further growth and consolidation of the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and in favor of the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society.

    The Soviet people voting for the candidates of Stalin's Party and Non-Party Alliance is also voting to support the Soviet Union's wise Stalinist foreign policy—a policy of striving for lasting peace among nations and expanding and consolidating the international front of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has been elected. The representatives of the Supreme Soviet are the most outstanding children of all the people of our multi-ethnic socialist country, and they have infinite loyalty to our Soviet motherland, to the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and to the cause of communism. Our country welcomes its representatives with the greatest love. The entire Soviet people place the name of the brilliant leader and teacher Comrade Stalin as their first Supreme Soviet representative. The entire Soviet people wholeheartedly express their love and infinite loyalty to the great Stalin—the creator of the people's happiness.

    Under the inspiration of Stalin's genius, the Soviet people, led by the Communist Party, are confidently and firmly advancing towards the victory of communism, setting an example for the people of the world to bravely and heroically fight for the freedom and happiness of the working people.

　　斯大林的党与非党联盟的伟大胜利
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十五日以《斯大林的党与非党联盟的伟大胜利》为题，发表社论称：
    苏联最高苏维埃选举中央选举委员会关于一九五○年三月十二日投票结果的声明及代表名单，说明了斯大林的党与非党联盟的伟大胜利。苏联最高苏维埃选举已在人民巨大爱国热潮与政治积极性当中在全国举行，并且动人地证明了苏联人民在精神上和政治上的团结一致。党与非党联盟所提名的候选人，已大获全胜。这次最高苏维埃选举运动，最广大群众政治积极性的规模与水平方面，都是无可比拟的。前往投票的选民，达一亿一千一百万以上。在历史上，除了我们的布尔什维克党以外再没有任何党派，除了我们的苏维埃政府以外，再没有任何政府，曾获得全体人民这样一致的支持，这样集中的信任票。社会历史上从来不晓得这样高的政治积极性和这样团结的意志，像苏联最高苏维埃选举所表示的那样：国内全体选民百分之九十九点九八参加了选举；参加苏维埃联盟院代表选举的选民的百分之九十九点七三和参加苏维埃民族院选举的选民的百分之九十九点七二，都投票选举斯大林的党与非党联盟候选人。这是多么动人、多么具有说服力量的数字！这些数字说明了苏联最高国家权力机构是建基在全体苏联人民的单一意志之上的，而全体苏联人民则紧密地团结在他们自己的布尔什维克党周围，团结在伟大的领袖与导师斯大林同志周围。最高苏维埃选举的结果，提供了新的、动人的证据，证明苏维埃社会制度和国家制度优于任何非苏维埃社会制度与国家制度。
    世界上从来没有像苏维埃社会精神上与政治上团结一致这样的社会团结，在一天天更加强大的列宁、斯大林党胜利的旗帜下形成的团结。这种精神上与政治上不可侵犯的团结，只有在社会主义已经胜利、剥削阶级已经消灭的社会才可能存在。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举的结果，再次说明只有社会主义才能保证人民有真正的民主，只有在社会主义下，人民才是他们命运的真正的主人翁。
    资本主义假民主的雇佣的卖唱者究竟能够用什么来对抗苏维埃社会主义社会劳动人民最伟大的积极性呢？在资本主义国家，劳动者那能有什么民主，在那里，千百万老百姓遭受到失业的恐怖，因冻馁与贫穷而死亡！今天，在资本主义国家，越来越广大的劳动人民群众正在开始恍然大悟：大事吹嘘的资产阶级民主原来完全是骗局。他们正开始明白在苏联繁荣滋长的、真正的、人民的、社会主义的民主之伟大。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举的结果，最生动地表明伟大列宁、斯大林党那种伟大的鼓舞和组织的活动，表明了它和人民之间的分不开的联系。苏联人民一致投票选举斯大林的党与非党的联盟，从而表示了对于共产党和伟大斯大林的热爱和无限忠诚。
    斯大林同志说：“共产党在竞选中不是孤立的。它与非党人民结成联盟来参加选举运动。”斯大林同志指出，苏维埃社会制度把非党人民与共产党人团结在苏联人民的一个共同的集体组织之中。在这个集体组织中，他们并肩作战以巩固我国的实力，他们在各个战线上为了自由、为了我们祖国的伟大而并肩作战和流血，他们还并肩地千锤百炼缔造胜利，使我国战胜了敌人。在我国，党与非党人民正从事一个共同的事业。这就是为什么党与非党人民的联盟乃是出乎自然和至为重要的原因。
    在苏联最高苏维埃选举中赢得了新的辉煌胜利的斯大林党与非党联盟的力量，在于它把工人、农民和知识分子在共产党的领导之下团结起来。这一联盟是我们胜利的基础和苏联获得更多成就的保证。苏联共产党（布）中央委员会在其告选民书中表示相信，全体选民将再度像一个人一样一致地把共产党会同非党人民一道提出的候选人选入苏联最高苏维埃，将再度表现他们对于列宁与斯大林党的无上信任。告选民书说：“共产党预期并依赖选民的这种信任和拥护，因为苏联人民从多年来的经验中已经确信和人民切身利益一致的党的政策的正确性。党的全部活动乃是忘我地为人民服务；对党来说，再没有其它利益高于人民的利益了。”
    我国全体人民一致投票选举了斯大林的党与非党的联盟的候选人，从而以巨大的爱国热情响应了列宁与斯大林的党的号召。苏联人民宣布，布尔什维克党的政策就是他们的政策，宣布他们全心全意信赖列宁和斯大林的党，并准备在其领导下向共产主义的胜利迈进。
    全体苏联人民投票选举党与非党联盟的候选人，就是投票赞成保持社会主义国家的强盛和自由，保持我们苏维埃国家强大无敌。苏联人民投票选举党与非党联盟的候选人，也就是投票赞成社会主义工业、农业和文化的进一步的巨大提高，和我国人民的生活水平的进一步改善。
    苏联人民投票选举党与非党联盟的候选人，也就是投票赞成苏联各族人民友谊的进一步增长与巩固，赞成苏维埃社会的精神上与政治上的团结。
    苏联人民投票选举斯大林的党与非党联盟的候选人，也就是投票拥护苏联的英明的斯大林外交政策——争取各民族间持久和平与扩大和巩固国际和平、民主和社会主义阵线的政策。
    苏联的最高苏维埃被选出来了。最高苏维埃的代表们都是我们多民族的社会主义国家全体人民的最优秀的儿女，他们对我们苏维埃祖国，对列宁和斯大林的党，对共产主义事业，都有无限的忠诚。我们国家以最大的热爱来欢迎它的代表人物。全体苏联人民都把光辉的领袖和导师斯大林同志的名字作为他们的第一名最高苏维埃代表。全体苏联人民都全心全意地表示他们对于伟大的斯大林——人民幸福的缔造者——的热爱和无限忠诚。
    在斯大林天才的鼓舞之下，为共产党所领导的苏联人民，满怀信心地、坚定地向共产主义的胜利前进，给全世界人民树立一个为劳动人民的自由和幸福而勇敢地英勇地进行斗争的榜样。
