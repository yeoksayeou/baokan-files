Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, Paris, 28th -- The Women's International Democratic Federation published a letter to the women of the world for "March 8th" International Women's Day to the press, which stated:

　　Women of all countries and all faiths are working hard to make March 8, 1950, a memorable day of struggle for the realization of their demands. The Women's International Democratic Federation extends its warm greetings to them.

　　This year, women will celebrate this holiday under the slogan of defending peace and life. Peace and life are the most precious things to them and are now threatened.

　　Women particularly abhor the danger of weapons of mass destruction. They know that the poverty that causes them pain is caused by huge military budgets. They will join with the advocates of peace to demand that the atomic bomb and other weapons of mass destruction be declared illegal.

　　They will resolutely demand respect for freedom, and first of all respect for all rights to demonstrate in defense of peace. They will win over to their side those honest and courageous people who refuse to sacrifice the future of the world for the huge profits of a group of profiteers. Let us preserve the lives of our children! Long live peace!

　　国际民主妇联为纪念“三八”节发表告全世界妇女书
    号召“保卫和平与生活、保全孩子们的生命！”
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：国际民主妇联向报界发表“三八”国际妇女节告全世界妇女书，内称：
    一切国家和一切信仰的妇女们正在努力奋斗，使一九五○年三月八日成为实现她们的要求而斗争的值得纪念的日子，国际民主妇联谨向她们致热烈的敬礼。
    今年，妇女们将在保卫和平与生活的口号下纪念这一节日，和平与生活是她们最珍贵的东西，现在已受到威胁。
    妇女们特别痛恨大规模毁灭性的武器所具有的危险。她们知道使她们感受痛苦的贫困，是由于庞大的军事预算所造成的。她们将与和平拥护者一道，共同要求宣布原子弹及其他大规模毁灭性的武器为非法。
    她们将坚决要求尊重自由，而首先是尊重为保卫和平而举行示威的一切权利。她们将把那些诚实而勇敢的人们，争取到她们这一方面来，这些诚实而勇敢的人们，是拒绝为一帮唯利是图者的巨额利益而牺牲世界的前途的。让我们保全我们孩子们的生命！和平万岁！
