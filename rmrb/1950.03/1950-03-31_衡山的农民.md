　　Hengshan's Farmers
    (Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Liu Xiao Xi)
  I. Twenty Years of Blood and Tears
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the 500,000 farmers of Hengshan are carrying out the anti-feudal rural reform movement in an orderly and step-by-step manner, carrying forward the traditional revolutionary spirit of the Great Revolution.
    Hengshan is a medium-sized county in central and southern Hunan, on the Yuehan Railway, and was liberated last October.
    In 1923, in the Yuebei area of Hengshan—thirty miles west of Hengshan city is Nanyue Mountain, and the area north of the mountain is called Yuebei—young peasant leaders Zhao Zisan and others organized the Workers' and Peasants' Association. They were later massacred by Zhao Hengti, the old-brand Hunan warlord and big landlord of Yuebei. This was the initial bud of the peasant movement in Hengshan under the leadership of the Communist Party. From 1926 to 1927, Hengshan universally organized peasant associations, women's associations, and labor children's corps... Nearly 100,000 peasants, women, and children participated in these organizations, launching a vigorous rural revolutionary movement and jointly supporting the victorious Northern Expedition with peasants from other regions. In August and September 1927, the Hengshan peasants held two major uprisings in Nanyue Town and Caoshi Town, frightening the reactionary landlords into panic and fleeing everywhere. They spread the word among themselves: "Tens of thousands of Red Army troops are holding exercises in the four townships of Nanyue."
    After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Kuomintang reactionaries in Hengshan, in conjunction with ordinary reactionary landlords, organized so-called "cleansing committees" and "bandit suppression defense bureaus" to carry out cruel massacres of peasants. They put forward such slogans as: "Rather kill ten thousand by mistake than let one slip through the net." At that time, the famous peasant leaders who were killed in Hengshan included Communist Party members Liu Zhennan and Chen Zuming, Hengshan Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Zhou Shuping, Hengshan Farmers' Bank Deputy Manager Xia Zhaomei, enlightened gentry Peng Kenan, student Dai Liben, woman Mao Daxiang, and hundreds of others.
    Xiang Xunqiu, a reactionary landlord, killed twenty-eight people during his twenty-seven days as the head of the bandit suppression defense bureau. A gentry named Peng Kenan spoke out of righteousness and was captured by Luo Bao, a member of the reactionary landlord cleansing committee. Luo Bao simply wrote a note on his sedan chair and had Peng Kenan shot on the road. There was a silversmith in Hengshan County, named Li Dairong. His three daughters and one son were all members of the children's corps or the Communist Youth League. The youngest daughter, Li Guang, was only thirteen years old when the Kuomintang reactionaries snatched her from her mother's arms and shot her. Li Dairong's second daughter, Li Jie, was also taken away and shot when she was getting into her sedan chair to get married. The eldest daughter, Li Shuzhen, and the son, Li Guo, were not caught, so the reactionaries imprisoned Li Dairong and his wife. The property of these victims was confiscated and their houses were burned down... For these twenty years, Hengshan, like all places under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, became a living hell.
    II. After Liberation
    After the liberation of Hengshan, the upper-level ruling structure of the Kuomintang reactionaries was smashed. But its cornerstone—the local despots and landlords—were still carrying out various sabotage activities in the countryside.
    Liao Renzhi, a local despot and landlord of the third bao of Guoshan Township, Yuebei, convened a secret meeting at home this February and instigated his running dog, the bao chief Liao Peiran, to convene a bao people's congress, openly promoting the changing of the regime and threatening the peasants by saying: "The peasant association was also established in the 16th year of the Republic of China, how long did it last? If you want to sue Liao Renzhi, the Kuomintang will come and kill you."
    During the grain requisition last year, the local despots and landlords concealed large amounts of land and shifted the burden. Xiang Damei, a landlord of Bailian Township, Third District of Hengshan, concealed more than sixty mu of land in one instance. Xiang Muzeng, a local despot and landlord of Bailian Township, concealed twelve mu of land in one instance. He was afraid of being exposed by his tenant Li Liangui, and said to Li Liangui: "We are old landlords and tenants, and we have always gotten along well. When the People's Liberation Army leaves tomorrow, the land will still be yours."
    The People's Government called on the masses to prepare for famine by planting spring vegetables, early crops, raising chickens and pigs, and issued forms to investigate the production of various agricultural and sideline products. The local despots, landlords and special agents then spread rumors: "The People's Government wants to levy taxes, and one chicken has to pay fifteen eggs a month."
    These phenomena are by no means accidental. Before the liberation of Hengshan, the Kuomintang bandits planted a group of trained habitual bandits in various rural areas, and also organized a large number of bandits. Among the scattered bandits that remain today, there are still so-called "Brown Commando Teams" and "Youth Expeditionary Forces." Although some of the local despots and landlords of Hengshan have fled to Taiwan and some have fled to major cities, they are still colluding with local special agents and gangs, and have left their confidants and running dogs to monitor the actions of the peasants and carry out sabotage activities.
    One of the biggest conspiracies of the Kuomintang special agents and local despots and landlords is to attempt to organize riots by taking advantage of the spring famine.
    After the autumn harvest last year, the landlords of Hengshan sold and dispersed large amounts of grain in order to resist grain requisition and rent reduction. For example, Deng Huangshi, a landlord of the 20th bao of the Fifth District, hid two hundred shi of grain in an nunnery in Jiulong City, Hengyang. Yin Tongshu, a landlord of the same bao, hid one hundred and fifty shi in the home of Deng Xiangheng in Bajia, 19th bao. Kuang Zhenfei, a landlord of Funing Village, Nanyue Town, hid more than one hundred shi of grain in the concealed walls of his home.
    Then, they propagated to the peasants: "In previous years, we would have grain to lend to you; this year the government's grain requisition is too heavy, look, there is not a grain of grain in our warehouses." In this way, they attempted to create a sense of food shortage among the peasants and organize the peasants to rob public grain.
  III. The People's Government and the Peasants
    After the liberation of Hengshan last October, the peasants, under the leadership of the People's Government, universally organized peasant representative conferences to assist the government in supporting the front, suppressing bandits, and requisitioning grain. In the heat of the mass movement, the peasants of Hengshan also enthusiastically began to universally organize peasant associations, women's associations, and the New Democratic Youth League, elect village people's political power, abolish the reactionary baojia system, and establish a solid foundation for the people's democratic dictatorship.
    The dark days are gone forever. The spring of 1950 brought unlimited new atmosphere to the rural areas of Hengshan, filled with birdsong and floral fragrance.
    In the rural areas of Hengshan, everywhere you can see peasants gathering, and you can hear the peasants shouting:
    "Now the world belongs to us!"
    "Down with the local despots and landlords! We want to stand up!"
    Many cadres working in Hengshan who came from the old liberated areas of North China unanimously said: The peasants of Hengshan are awakening quickly.
    Guo Budeng, the district head of the Third District of Hengshan, told reporters that when they started their work, there were only a dozen people, with one pistol, one seal of the district people's government, and 15,000 yuan in RMB. They had no vegetables to eat with their meals, and had to borrow ink from the township government to write official documents and stamp seals. The feudal remnants in the township government looked down on these cadres, and they quietly said: "Can these people do anything?"
    At that time, bandits were everywhere, and the People's Liberation Army had already advanced towards Hengyang. The district had no armed forces, and the township bao chiefs reported false situations every day (a few bao chiefs reported the truth) in an attempt to scare away this "incompetent" district government. However, a miracle happened. From mid-October to the end of November last year, the People's District Government basically eliminated all the scattered bandits in the entire district in just fifty days. Thirty-six bandits were captured alive, fifteen surrendered voluntarily, thirty-two rifles, fifteen pistols, and two submachine guns were seized, and goods worth tens of millions of yuan looted from the masses were returned.
    What is the secret here?
    District Head Guo said: "The peasants enthusiastically support us."
    Once, on a rainy night, the district government moved to the fifth bao of Bailian Township. It was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers, and they lost their way.
    They happened to encounter a farmer, and they asked him to take them to their destination.
    The farmer suddenly disappeared, and after a while, he came back with a large bundle of firewood. He lit the fire and said:
    "Comrades, quickly warm your clothes, it's so cold."
    After a while, he found a lot of straw: "Comrades, spread it out and sleep on it."
    The people of the district government insisted on standing guard. The farmer would not let them. He said: "Comrades, sleep peacefully, you have to work tomorrow, I will stand guard for you."
    He stayed up all night alone. This farmer is called Xiang Yumei.
    In order to concentrate its forces and open up the situation, the District People's Government began by starting with two bao. After slowly understanding the situation, they began to arrest bandits. Because the peasants helped with reconnaissance, guided the way, and stood guard, the situation in the entire district quickly developed.
    The peasants thought of many ways to help the government capture bandits. Xiang Yumei came up with many ideas. When people were crowded at the market, he used chalk to mark the clothes of the bandits, and handed cigarettes to the bandits—because they were local habitual bandits, many people recognized them—, which gave the people of the district government indications of the target.
    When the reporter talked with Xiang Yumei, he recalled the history of past struggles. He said: "In 1947, they secretly organized mutual aid associations in Bailian Township, but they were discovered by the reactionaries and dissolved automatically. Last June, upon hearing that the People's Liberation Army had already reached Changsha, they organized peasant associations to prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army. When the People's Liberation Army reached Shiwanzhen, thirty miles away from Bailian Township on the Yuehan Road, some of them immediately rushed to Shiwanzhen to welcome them and participated in supporting the front."
    Now, 500,000 peasants in more than 300 bao of Hengshan are surging into the anti-hegemony, rent-reduction, and production-preparation movement. Their slogan is: "We cannot stand up without overthrowing the local despots and landlords!"

　　衡山的农民
    （本报特派记者  刘晓晞）
  一  血泪二十年
    衡山五十万农民，在中国共产党领导之下，发扬大革命时传统的革命精神，有秩序、有步骤地展开了反封建的农村改革运动。
    衡山是湖南中南部粤汉路上的一个中等县份，去年十月解放的。
    一九二三年，衡山岳北地区——衡山城西三十里有南岳山，山北地区叫岳北——即有青年农民领袖赵子三等四人，组织了工农会。后被岳北大地主湖南老牌军阀赵恒惕所屠杀。这是在共产党领导下衡山农民运动最初的幼芽，一九二六——二七年，衡山普遍组织了农民协会、妇女协会、劳动童子团……曾有近十万农民、妇女、儿童，参加这些组织，发动了轰轰烈烈的农村革命运动，与其他各地农民共同支持了胜利的北伐进军。一九二七年八九月间，衡山农民又在南岳镇、草市镇举行了两次大暴动，吓得反动地主们惊惶失措，四处逃窜，他们互相传告：“南岳四乡有数万红军会操。”
    大革命失败后，衡山的国民党反动派结合一般反动地主，组织了所谓清乡委员会、剿共团防局，对农民进行残酷的屠杀。他们提出了这样的口号：“宁肯错杀一万，不准漏网一人。”当时在衡山被杀的著名农民领袖，有共产党员刘振南、陈祖名，衡山总工会会长周树屏，衡山农民银行副经理夏兆梅，开明士绅彭克南，学生戴立本，妇女毛达湘等数百人。
    反动地主向勋秋做了二十七天剿共团防局长，即杀了二十八个人。有个叫彭克南的士绅仗义执言，被反动地主清乡委员罗豹捉住了。罗豹只在轿子上写了一张便条，就把彭克南枪毙在路上。衡山县城内有个银匠，名叫李待荣。他的三个女儿，一个儿子，都是儿童团员或共产主义青年团员。幼女李广，才十三岁，被国民党反动派从母亲怀里抢去枪毙了。李待荣的二女李洁，在出嫁上轿的时候，也被拿去枪毙。长女李淑贞，儿子李果没有被捉住，反动派就把李待荣夫妇关进监狱。这些被害者的财产均被抄没，房屋被焚毁……，这二十多年，衡山和所有国民党反动派统治下的地方一样，成了人间地狱。
    二  解放以后
    衡山解放后，国民党反动派的上层统治机构是打碎了。但它的基石——恶霸地主们仍然在农村里进行各种破坏活动。
    岳北果山乡第三保恶霸地主廖任之，今年二月即曾在家里召集秘密会议，并唆使他的走狗保长廖沛然召开保民大会，公开宣传变天，并威胁农民说：“民国十六年也办过农会，又办了多久？你们如果要控告廖任之，那时国民党来了，会要杀头的。”
    去年征粮的时候，恶霸地主们大量瞒田，转嫁负担。衡山第三区白莲乡地主向大美，一次即瞒田六十余亩。白莲乡恶霸地主向慕曾，一次瞒田十二亩。他害怕被佃户李连桂揭露，对李连桂说：“我们是老东老佃，平日相处很好，明日解放军走了，田还叫你作。”
    人民政府号召群众生产备荒，大量种春菜，种早庄稼，养鸡喂猪，发下表格，调查各种农副业生产情况。恶霸地主和特务便大肆造谣：“人民政府要抽税，一只鸡，每月要纳十五个蛋。”
    这些现象绝不是偶然的。衡山解放前，国民党匪帮就把一批经过训练的惯匪潜伏到各个农村，并曾大量组织股匪。在目前留下的散匪中间，仍有所谓“褐色挺进队”和“青年远征军”等名目。衡山的恶霸地主虽然有的已经跑到台湾，有的跑到各大城市，但他们仍与本地特务、帮会有勾结，并留有自己的亲信走狗，监视农民行动，进行破坏活动。
    国民党特务和恶霸地主一个最大阴谋，是企图利用春荒，组织暴动。
    去年秋收以后，衡山的地主们为了抵抗征粮、减租，即大量出卖、分散粮食。例如第五区二十保地主邓黄氏，把两百石谷子藏在衡阳九龙市的庵子里。同保地主尹同书把一百五十石藏在十九保八甲邓湘衡家里。南岳镇福宁村地主旷镇非把一百多石谷子隐蔽在自己家里的夹壁里面。
    然后，他们向农民宣传说：“要是往年，我们还有谷子借给你们；今年政府征粮太重，你看我们的仓里那里有一粒谷子。”这样，他们企图来在农民中间造成一种缺粮的恐慌情绪，并组织农民抢夺公粮。
  三  人民政府与农民
    去年十月衡山解放，农民们即在人民政府领导下普遍组织起农代会，协助政府支前、剿匪、征粮。火热的群众运动中，衡山的农民又热烈地开始普遍组织农民协会、妇女协会、新民主主义青年团，选举村人民政权，废除反动的保甲制度，给人民民主专政建立坚实的基础。
    黑暗的日子永远过去了。一九五○年的春天，给鸟语花香的衡山农村带来了无限的新气象。
    在衡山的农村里，现在到处可以看见农民在集会，可以听到农民们的呼喊：
    “现在是我们的天下了！”
    “打倒恶霸地主！我们要翻身！”
    在衡山工作的许多从华北老解放区去的干部，他们一致说：衡山的农民觉悟快。
    衡山第三区区长郭步登告诉记者，他们开辟工作的时候，一共只有十几个人，带一条短枪，一颗区人民政府的印鉴，和一万五千元人民币。他们吃饭没有菜，写公事盖印要和乡公所借印色。乡公所里的封建余孽们是看不起这些干部的，他们悄悄地说：“这些人也能办事？”
    当时土匪遍地，解放军已经向衡阳前进，区里没有武装，乡保长们每天报告假情况（有个别保长报告真情况），企图把这个“不能办事”的区政府吓跑。但是，奇迹出现了。人民区政府从去年十月中旬起到十一月底止，不过五十天功夫，把全区散匪大体肃清。活捉土匪三十六名，自动投诚十五名，缴获步枪三十二支，短枪十五支，冲锋枪二支，发还群众被抢东西价值数千万元。
    这里有什么秘密吗？
    郭区长说：“农民热烈支持我们。”
    有一次，在一个下雨的夜里，区政府转移到白莲乡第五保。天黑得伸手不见五指，他们迷失了方向。
    刚好碰到了一个农民，他们让他带到了目的地。
    这个农民忽然不见了，过了一会儿，又抱着一大捆柴回来了。他点燃着火，说：
    “同志们，快烤烤衣服吧，好冷啊。”
    一会儿，他又找到许多稻草：“同志们，铺着睡吧。”
    区政府的人一定要放哨。这个农民一定不让。他说：“同志们，你们放心睡吧，你们明天还要办公，我给你们放哨。”
    他一个人通夜没有睡觉。这个农民叫做向宇梅。
    区人民政府为了集中力量，打开局面，开始先从两个保作起。慢慢了解了情况，即动手捕捉土匪。因为有农民帮助侦察，带路，放哨，全区局面很快便开展了。
    农民们在协助政府捕捉土匪时，想了许多办法。向宇梅就想了许多办法，他在赶集人挤的时候，拿粉笔在土匪的衣服上作记号，递纸烟给土匪吸——因为是地方上的惯匪，许多人都认识——，这就给区政府的人指示了目标。
    记者同向宇梅谈话时，他回忆了以往的斗争历史，他说：“一九四七年，他们即在白莲乡秘密组织互助会，后来被反动派发觉，自动解散了。去年六月，听到解放军已经打到长沙，他们又组织起农会，准备迎接解放军。等到解放军打到粤汉路上离白莲乡三十里路的石湾镇，他们中立刻就有人赶到石湾镇去迎接，并且参加了支前工作。”
    现在衡山三百多个保五十万农民，汹涌澎湃地卷入了反霸减租和生产备荒运动。他们的口号是：“不打倒恶霸地主不能翻身！”
  一九五○年三月
