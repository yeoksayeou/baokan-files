The CPC Central Committee North China Bureau Instructs the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee and the Party Group of the Provincial Government
Correct Errors in Their Work
Should Accept the Urgent Demands of the Broad Masses of People and Pay Attention to Leading Production

[By Our Newspaper] In order to help the Pingyuan Provincial CPC Committee and the CPC Party Group of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government correct the errors they have committed in their work, the CPC Central Committee North China Bureau issued the following letter of instruction to the Provincial Committee and the Party Group of the Provincial Government on February 26:

To the Pingyuan Provincial Committee and the Party Group of the Provincial Government:

First, the urgent demands of the broad masses of people in Pingyuan Province are currently production, disaster relief, opposition to the coercive commandism of Party and government workers in their work, and the stabilization of social order. The most important demand is production. This has been repeatedly instructed by the State Council of the Central People's Government. However, last winter, except in a few areas, you were only shouting slogans about production. In reality, you spent most or all of your time on tasks such as grain requisition, land reform, and Party rectification, without making winter production the central focus. Of the tasks you carried out, apart from grain requisition, which had a time constraint and could not be avoided, the others could have been postponed. When you carried out these tasks that could have been postponed, you did not combine these tasks with production. In this way, you went against the demands of the masses, took the wrong direction, and put your work in a passive position. You must earnestly formulate production plans that fully conform to the actual conditions of Pingyuan and specific measures to implement these plans.

Second, the production enthusiasm of the masses in Pingyuan is high. However, because the People's Governments of most counties in Pingyuan Province have been slow to issue land certificates (Neihuang stopped issuing them for two years), and because the policies you have implemented continue to infringe upon or have not actively protected the interests of the middle peasants in many places, the peasants have developed concerns about "further struggles," "further reviews," and "large-scale collectivization." To dispel these concerns, you must, through the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, urge the People's Governments of all counties to immediately issue land certificates to peasants who have already been allocated land; you must publicize and earnestly implement policies to protect the property rights of peasants; and you must make production issues the main content of the people's representative conferences at the provincial, county, and municipal levels.

Disaster Relief Cannot Just Be Empty Slogans; Mass Production Must Be Organized Household by Household

Third, the disaster situation in Pingyuan is still very serious. Some lightly affected areas have gradually become severely affected areas, and people have begun to starve to death in severely affected areas. The reason why the disaster situation continues to develop is mainly because your leading organs do not pay enough attention to the disaster situation, and the organization and leadership of disaster relief work and timely inspection are also very poor. Disaster relief work is mostly just shouting slogans. You must sufficiently estimate the severity of the disaster situation in Pingyuan, resolutely take action, implement the policy of self-reliance through production, overcome the mentality of waiting for relief, and even more so, not postpone disaster relief work under the pretext of being busy with other work. It is necessary to fully utilize the methods of Party representative conferences and people's representative conferences to discuss and decide on production self-help plans for counties, districts, villages, and individual households. We should widely introduce and commend the disaster relief experience of Shou Zhang County to promote disaster relief work in other disaster areas. In order to implement disaster relief work, all work departments must act in unison and must not act independently. Responsible comrades of the Party should participate personally. The material resources for your disaster relief work are already prepared. The key lies in leading and organizing the masses to bring into play the role of these material resources in order to achieve self-reliance through production and overcome the famine.

Reduce Expenditures, Severely Punish Embezzlers and Wasteful Elements, and Provide Compensation to Grain-Delivering Peasants Who Have Suffered Losses

Fourth, many peasants in Pingyuan Province feel that this year's public grain burden is heavy and taxes are high. In reality, although the burden is not light, the problem is not that the peasants cannot afford it, but that you have not done your work well. If you had done it well, the peasants would not have the feeling they have now. The shortcomings in your work are that the distribution and apportionment are unfair, and the methods of reduction and exemption are unreasonable. When delivering public grain, many places were not prepared to receive it, resulting in delays of several days, causing deaths and injuries to people and livestock (at the Daokou Station, 104 animals died, and 1 person died and 5 were injured). There are also phenomena of waste and embezzlement by cadres (600,000 catties of grain were damaged in Changyuan, and in many places, public grain was stolen or mixed with soil). Therefore, in addition to actively mobilizing the masses to engage in production and increase income, you should pay attention to consolidating village finances and reducing expenditures; conscientiously assess production to make collection fair and reasonable; repair warehouses and strictly implement the public grain management system; severely punish embezzlers, wasteful elements, and thieves; and inspect the errors of a few cadres who bear less or no burden. For the deaths and injuries of peasants in the grain delivery work, condolences should be given and the losses of the peasants should be compensated. For those who have caused serious errors and criminal acts, responsibilities should be clarified, punishments should be meted out separately, and the handling methods should be announced in the newspapers to educate Party members, cadres, and the people. It is necessary to explain to the people the reasons why the people's burden cannot be reduced after the victory of the revolutionary war. It is necessary to clearly tell people from all walks of life that only by actively engaging in production and practicing economy to increase people's income, and by having government agencies and troops reduce expenditures as much as possible, can the people's burden be relatively reduced, and can we jointly overcome the temporary difficulties after victory.

Oppose Coercive Commandism and Warlordism; Party Members and Cadres Who Break the Law Must Be Subject to the Sanctions of Law and Discipline

Fifth, the style of coercive commandism and unreasonableness among Party members and cadres in Pingyuan Province is quite serious. A few cadres dare to arbitrarily beat, scold, and detain people, and even beat people to death or force them to death. This kind of lawless phenomenon must be strictly corrected. For example, Bian Cheng, the Secretary of the Yuanyang County Party Committee, beat representatives of all circles, and a section chief of the Qingping County Government beat actors on stage. This is a bad style of warlordism and must be given due punishment promptly. You should conduct in-depth democratic education among Party members to oppose the style of coercive commandism and warlordism. At the same time, discipline must be strictly enforced; Party members and cadres who break the law must not only be dealt with according to law, but also be subject to the sanctions of Party discipline. Communist Party members are not a privileged class, but servants of the people. All these principles should be solemnly announced at the Party congress and people's representative conferences at all levels, and formal resolutions should be made. Responsible persons of Party committees at all levels should first set an example by seriously conducting self-criticism of the errors and shortcomings in their work in order to cultivate a democratic style.

Sixth, you should have a sufficient estimate of the danger of secret society bandit activities in Pingyuan Province. You should systematically investigate and study the activities of secret society bandits and quickly determine appropriate solutions. People's governments at all levels in Pingyuan Province should strictly ban illegal activities that hinder production and disrupt social order, mobilize the people to cooperate with the army and the government to carry out bandit suppression and anti-secret society work, and use political efforts to win over and disintegrate them in coordination with necessary armed suppression in order to thoroughly eliminate them. The ringleaders of secret society bandits who have committed heinous crimes must be severely punished according to law; however, villages that have participated in secret societies but have now withdrawn and followers who have reformed should be treated the same as ordinary villages and people and should not be discriminated against. The fundamental way to eliminate bandits and secret societies lies in transforming all idlers who do not engage in proper occupations so that they engage in production, so that secret societies and bandits will have no opportunity to take advantage of.

　　中共中央华北局指示平原省党委和省政府党组
    纠正工作中所犯错误
    应接受广大人民迫切要求注意领导生产
    【本报讯】为了帮助平原省中共党委和平原省人民政府中共党组纠正他们在工作中所犯的错误，中共中央华北局于二月二十六日向该省委和该省政府党组发出了如下的指示信：平原省委和省政府党组：
    第一、目前平原省广大人民的迫切要求是生产、救灾、反对党政工作人员工作中的强迫命令作风、稳定社会秩序。其中最主要的要求是生产。这是中央人民政府政务院所曾一再指示过的。但你们去冬除在少数地区外，都是空喊生产，实际把大部甚至全部时间用在征粮、土地改革、整党等项工作上，没有把冬季生产作为中心。在你们所进行的那些工作中，除征粮带时间性不能不做以外，其他的本可缓办。而你们在进行这些本可缓办的工作时，又没有把这些工作与生产结合。这样你们就违背了群众的要求，走错了方向，就使得你们工作处于被动。你们必须切实制订完全符合平原实际情况的生产计划及实现这些计划的具体办法。
    第二、平原群众的生产情绪是高涨的，但由于平原省多数县人民政府迟迟不发土地证（内黄停了两年未发），加之你们所执行的政策在许多地方继续侵犯或没有积极保护中农利益，农民便产生了怕“再斗争”、“再复查”、“大合伙”等顾虑。为解除这些顾虑，你们必须经由平原省人民政府督促各县人民政府，立即对已分地农民发土地证，必须宣传并切实执行保障农民财权地权的政策，必须把生产问题作为省县市各界人民代表会议的主要内容。
    救灾不能只空喊口号要逐户组织群众生产
    第三、平原灾情仍十分严重。有些轻灾区已逐渐变为重灾区，重灾区开始饿死人。灾情之所以继续发展，主要是因为你处领导机关对灾情重视不够，对救灾工作的组织领导和及时检查也很差，救灾工作多半只是喊口号。你们必须要足够估计平原灾情的严重性，坚决行动起来，贯彻生产自救方针，克服等待救济思想，更不能借口忙于其它工作，而把救灾工作搁置下来。要充分运用党代表会议和人民代表会议办法，讨论并决定县、区、村和逐户的生产自救计划。应广泛介绍与表扬寿张县的救灾经验，以推动其他灾区的救灾工作。为贯彻救灾工作，各工作部门必须一致行动，不得各自为政。党的负责同志应亲自参加。你们救灾工作的物质力量已有准备，关键在于领导组织群众，发挥这些物质力量的作用，以达生产自救、渡过灾荒的目的。
    减少开支严惩贪污浪费分子抚恤赔偿受损失的送粮农民
    第四、平原省许多农民感到今年公粮重、税多。而实际上，负担虽然并不轻，但问题还不是农民已经负担不起，而在于你们工作没有做好。如果作得好，农民就不会发生像现在这样的感觉。你们工作的缺点在于分配摊派不公，减免办法又不合理。送公粮时，许多地方没有准备好接收的人，以致拖延数日，造成人畜死伤（道口站畜死一百零四头，人死四、伤五）。干部也有浪费、贪污现象（长垣损坏粮食六十万斤，很多地方公粮发生被偷被搀土的情事）。因此你们除应积极发动群众，进行生产，增加收入外，要注意整理村财政，减少开支；认真评产，使征收公平合理；修理仓库，严格公粮的保管制度，严惩贪污浪费偷盗分子，检查少数干部少负担和不负担的错误。对于送粮工作中农民的死伤，应进行抚恤，并赔偿农民的损失。对于造成严重错误与犯罪行为的人员，应弄清责任，分别处分，并将处理办法在报纸上公布，以教育党员、干部和人民。要向人民解释革命战争胜利后人民负担还不能减轻的原因。要明白告诉各界人民，只有大家积极生产节约以增加人民收入，机关部队尽量减少开支，这样才能相对地减轻人民负担，共同渡过胜利后暂时的困难。
  反对强迫命令和军阀主义作风  党员干部犯法要受法纪的制裁
    第五、平原省党员干部中强迫命令不讲道理的作风，相当严重。有少数干部敢于随便打人骂人扣人，甚至打死人逼死人。这种无法无天的现象必须严格纠正。如原阳县委书记卞诚殴打各界代表会代表，青平县府科长在戏台上扣打演员，这是恶劣的军阀主义作风，必须迅速给以应得的处分。你们应在党员中深入进行民主教育，反对强迫命令作风与军阀主义作风。同时要严格地执行纪律；党员与干部犯法不仅须依法处理，而且要受党纪的制裁。共产党员不是特权阶级，而是人民的勤务员。所有这些道理，应在党的代表大会、各级人民代表会议上郑重宣布，并作出正式决议。各级党委负责人首先应以身作则，对自己工作中的错误与缺点，应严肃地进行自我批评，以养成民主作风。
    第六、你们对于平原省会门土匪活动的危险性应有足够的估计。应有系统地调查研究会门土匪的活动情况，并迅速定出适当的解决办法。平原省各级人民政府应当严格取缔妨害生产扰乱社会秩序的非法活动，发动人民群众协同军队与政府进行剿匪反会门工作，用政治上的争取瓦解来配合必要的武装镇压，以达到彻底消灭的目的。对于罪大恶极的会门土匪头子，必须依法严惩；但对曾经参加过会门而现已脱离的村庄和已经改过自新的徒众，应与一般村庄和人民同样待遇，不得歧视。消灭土匪会门的根本办法，则在于改造一切不务正业的游民，使其从事生产，这样会门、土匪分子才会无隙可乘。
        中共中央华北局  二月二十六日
