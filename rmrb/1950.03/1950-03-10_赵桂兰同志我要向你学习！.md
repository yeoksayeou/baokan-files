Reader's Letter

　　Comrade Zhao Guilan, I want to learn from you!
　　Zhou Fufang

　　Respected Comrade Zhao Guilan:

　　Of course, you don't know me, and you might be surprised why I would write to you. Now let me tell you how I came to know you and why I thought of writing this letter.

　　In the "Party Life" section on the third page of the People's Daily on March 1st, I read an article about the extraordinary deeds created by you – the good daughter of the Communist Party – on December 19th of last year. I read it again and again. I was not only moved by your great spirit, but I also realized what power supported you, enabling you to do such amazing and extraordinary things. That is your firm belief and goal – to fight to the end for the cause of communism. This firm belief and goal is the source of your strength. Therefore, you can dedicate all your strength, even your life, to the interests of the revolution in everything you do. You never think of your own interests. Even when you found out that your left hand was gone, the first thing you thought of was: "My education is too low, and I won't be able to do more work for the Party in the future!" As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "A Communist Party member can make his personal interests absolutely and unconditionally subordinate to the interests of the Party in any situation, which is the standard for testing whether this party member is loyal to the Party, the revolution, and the cause of communism." Indeed, you are a good daughter of the Communist Party, and even more so, a good daughter of the new China, and you are worthy of being learned from by everyone.

　　I am currently recuperating in an infectious disease hospital in Beijing. I have tuberculosis, and I have been sick for a year and two months. Although this disease is not too terrible, it is very annoying. Because first, it requires a long period of recuperation, and second, if you are not careful after you get better, the disease will recur, which is so detrimental to work and study! But in order to be able to do more work for the people in the future, I must now take good care of myself and wait until my body is fully recovered before participating in work. I have not yet joined the Communist Party, but in the future, I will definitely learn from you in my work and in every action. Serve the people wholeheartedly, subordinate everything to the interests of the revolution, and do not care about personal interests; work actively, study hard, and strive to be a Communist Party member. Dedicate my life, dedicate all my strength, and fight to the end for the cause of communism.

　　Of course, a disabled body will be an obstacle to your future work and study, making you feel difficult. But you should have confidence, and you should believe this sentence: "There is no fortress in the world that the Bolsheviks cannot overcome!"

　　I don't know if you have read the novel "How the Steel Was Tempered"? It was written by the famous Soviet writer Ostrovsky. You can borrow it and read it. This book will be a great encouragement to you. The protagonist Paul in the novel is worthy of our learning throughout his life. Although he was unable to move half of his body and was blind in the end, he overcame all the difficulties brought to him by his disabled body in order to "make his life useful" and "contribute something to the Party and to his class." He used his recuperation time to strengthen his cultural and literary cultivation, and finally he became a famous writer. He completed many novels by dictation. These books have had and continue to have a major educational significance for the younger generation. He said: "It is possible to work under the most difficult and arduous conditions, not only possible, but also necessary, if there is no other way." So I hope that you will still muster up the courage, as long as you have a firm working ambition and patience to overcome difficulties, then you will definitely achieve victory in your future work. And the Party and comrades will help you and take care of you.

　　Finally, I hope that you will take care of your health. Because we have no right to neglect our health. We must value our lives, as Paul said: "The most precious thing a person has is life, and life is only once for us." A person's life should be spent in this way, so that when he looks back on the past, he will not regret wasting his years, nor will he be ashamed of his past mediocrity, so that when he is dying, he can say: "My entire life and energy have been dedicated to the most magnificent cause in the world – the struggle for the liberation of mankind."

　　Comrade Guilan: Let us learn from Paul together! Let us overcome all difficulties in our work and in our lives, so that our lives can be more useful.

　　I don't know how your recovery is going? I miss you very much. I really wish I could go to your side to see you, but how can this be done? So I can only write this letter to you to express my respect and concern for you. At the same time, I hope that this letter of mine will be of some help to your recovery – even if it is just a little bit. Of course, I dare not hope that you will reply to me before you have fully recovered, but I always hope that you (or the nurse or comrade who takes care of you) will give me a reply, even if it is just the word "received," it will make me grateful and relieved.

　　Okay, that's all for now, let's continue talking when we have the opportunity! Now I wish you a speedy recovery here.

　　And give my highest regards

　　Your friend

　　Zhou Fufang respectfully

　　March 4th on the bed

　　(The "Party Life" column of this newspaper on March 1 published "Zhao Guilan, a Good Daughter of the Communist Party." Many readers were deeply moved after reading it, and Comrade Zhou Fufang was one of them. She enthusiastically wrote this letter to Comrade Zhao Guilan.

### 赵桂兰同志我要向你学习！
周抚方
1950-03-10
第3版()
专栏：读者来信

　　赵桂兰同志我要向你学习！
    周抚方敬爱的赵桂兰同志：
    当然你是不认识我的，而且你会奇怪，我为什么会给你写信，现在让我告诉你，我怎样认识了你，而且为什么想起给你写这封信。
    在三月一日人民日报第三版的“党的生活”一栏里，我读到一篇登着去年十二月十九日你——共产党的好女儿，所创造的不平凡的事迹的文章。我读了一遍又一遍，我不但被你这种伟大的精神所感动，而且我更认识了究竟是什么力量支持着你，使你能够做出这惊人的不平凡的事情。那就是你那坚定的信仰与目标——为共产主义的事业而奋斗到底。这坚定的信仰与目标，就是你那力量的源泉。所以你能够在每件事情上为了革命的利益献出自己所有的力量，甚至自己的生命。你从不想到自己的利益，甚至当你发现自己的左手已经没有了的时候，你先想到的还是：“我文化太低，往后再不能为党多做工作了！”正如刘少奇同志所说的：“一个共产党员，能够使他个人的利益，不论在任何情况下，都能绝对地无条件地服从党的利益，是考验这个党员，是否忠于党，忠于革命与共产主义事业的标准”。确实，你是共产党的好女儿，更是新中国的好女儿，是值得每一个人向你学习的。
    我现在是在北京一个传染病院里疗养。我得的是肺结核的病，已经病了一年零两个月了。这个病虽然不算太可怕，但是却很讨厌。因为第一需要长时间的修养，第二好了以后如果不加小心，病是要重犯的，这是多么影响工作与学习啊！但是为了将来能够为人民多做些工作，现在我一定要好好养病，等身体完全恢复健康了，再好好参加工作。我还没有加入共产党，不过将来我一定在工作中，在每一举动中向你学习。全心全意为人民服务，一切服从于革命的利益，不计较个人的利益；积极工作，努力学习，争取做一个共产党员。把我的一生，把我的全部力量贡献出来，为共产主义事业而奋斗到底。
    当然，残缺的身体对于你往后的工作与学习，会是一种障碍，使你感到困难。但是你应当有信心，你也应当相信这句话：“世界上是没有布尔什维克所不能克服的堡垒的”！
    不知道你读过“钢铁是怎样炼成的”这本小说没有？这是苏联名作家奥斯特洛夫斯基写的。你可以借来看看，这书对你将会有很大的鼓励。小说里的主角保尔，他的一生就是值得我们学习的。他虽然到最后半身不能走动，两眼睛也瞎了，但是他为了“使自己的生命有用处”为了“对于党，对于自己的阶级多少有些贡献”，他克服了一切残废的肉体所带给他的困难。他利用养病的时间，加强自己的文化与文学修养，终于他成了有名的作家。他用口述办法完成了许多小说。这些书对于年青的一代曾经而且继续起着重大的教育意义。他说过：“在最困难和艰苦的条件下是可以工作的，不仅可能，并且还必须这样，假如是没有其他办法的话”。所以我希望你，仍旧要鼓起勇气，只要有着坚定的工作志向，有耐心克服困难，那么，你一定会在将来的工作中取得胜利。而且党、以及同志们是会帮助你，照顾你的。
    最后，我希望你，保重自己的身体。因为我们没有任何忽视自己健康的权利。我们要重视自己的生命，正如保尔所说的：“人最宝贵的东西是生命，生命于我们只有一次而已”。一个人的生命应当这样渡过的，当他回首往事时，他不因虚度年华而悔恨，也不因过去的碌碌无为而羞耻，这样他在临死的时候就能够说：“我整个的生命与精力都已献给世界上最壮丽的事业——为人类的自由解放而作的斗争”。
    桂兰同志：让我们一起向保尔学习吧！让我们在工作中，在生活中克服所有的困难，使自己的生命能更有用处。
    我不知道你现在病恢复得怎么样？我很挂念你。我真恨不得能到你身边看你去，但是这怎么能做到呢？所以我只有写这封信给你，以表示我对你的敬意与关系。同时我希望我这封信对于你的养病会有一点帮助——那怕是一点儿也好。当然我不敢希望你在没有完全恢复以前给我回信，但是我总希望你（或者让照顾你的护士或同志）给我一个回音，那怕是“收到”两个字也会使我感激与放心。
    好吧，不谈了，以后有机会咱们再继续谈吧！现在我在这儿祝你早日恢复健康。
              并致最崇高的敬礼
    你的朋友
                                         周抚方敬上
                                            三月四日于床上
    （三月一日本报“党的生活”栏发表了“共产党的好女儿赵桂兰”。许多读者读后深受感动，周抚方同志便是其中的一个。她热情地给赵桂兰同志写了这封信。我们除将原信寄交赵桂兰同志外，并全文发表，借以表示广大读者对赵桂兰同志的崇敬和关怀。——编者）
