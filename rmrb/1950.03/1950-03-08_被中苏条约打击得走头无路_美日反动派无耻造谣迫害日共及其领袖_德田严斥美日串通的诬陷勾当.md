Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: The MacArthur headquarters and the Yoshida government it controls are colluding and acting unscrupulously, using fabricated excuses to persecute the Japanese Communist Party and its leader, Tokuda Kyuichi. According to Tokyo Broadcasting: The Special Committee for Repatriation of Prisoners of the Japanese Senate, based on so-called "testimonies" from two Japanese prisoners of war recently repatriated from the Soviet Union on February 23rd, falsely accused the Japanese Communist Party of requesting the Soviet government to delay the repatriation of "reactionary elements" among Japanese prisoners of war, and decided to "summon" JCP General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi on March 13th. Subsequently, British representative Hodgson of the Allied Council for Japan suggested that the occupying authorities directly investigate Tokuda Kyuichi's "crimes" (Reuters). On March 1st, U.S. representative Sebald of the Allied Council for Japan expressed "agreement" with Hodgson's suggestion and read out in the council the "condemnations" of Tokuda by forty-four Japanese prisoners of war who had returned from the Soviet Union. Under Sebald's manipulation, the Allied Council formally requested MacArthur to "investigate" Tokuda Kyuichi.

JCP General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi has already sternly refuted this collusive slander at a press conference on the 2nd. He said: The fabricated "charges" announced by Sebald to "interrogate" him are untenable. Japanese Communist Party members issued a statement in the Diet on the 1st, pointing out that the instigation of the Japanese parliament to "summon" Tokuda is an anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement by those reactionary forces who have been driven to a dead end by the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the exposure of Emperor Hirohito's crimes. Its intention is to attempt to prevent the Communist Party from leading the Japanese people towards independence and peace.

According to TASS Tokyo: The Yoshida government's Prosecutor General's Office has ordered the suppression of local organizations of the JCP in six locations including Yamagata City and Fuse City in Osaka Prefecture, on the pretext that they did not register in accordance with the so-called "Group Control Law" promulgated by the government in April 1949. The Japanese Communist Party has formally protested, condemning the Yoshida government's move as a step towards declaring the Communist Party illegal.

　　被中苏条约打击得走头无路
    美日反动派无耻造谣迫害日共及其领袖
    德田严斥美日串通的诬陷勾当
    【新华社北京七日电】麦克阿瑟总部及其控制的吉田政府正狼狈为奸，以卑鄙捏造的借口来迫害日本共产党及其领袖德田球一。据东京广播：日本参议院遣俘特别委员会，于二月二十三日根据最近自苏联遣返的两个日本战俘的所谓“证言”，诬称日本共产党曾要求苏联政府延迟遣送日本战俘中的“反动分子”回国，并决定在三月十三日“传讯”日共总书记德田球一。接着，盟国对日管制委员会英国代表霍奇逊即建议由占领当局直接出面，调查德田球一的“罪状”（路透社）。三月一日，对日委员会美国代表赛鲍尔表示“同意”霍奇逊的建议，并在委员会中宣读了四十四名由苏返国日俘对德田的“谴责”。在赛鲍尔的操纵下，对日委员会正式要求麦克阿瑟“调查”德田球一。
    日共总书记德田球一对这一串通的诬陷勾当，已于二日在记者招待会上予以严正驳斥。他说：赛鲍尔所公布的要“审讯”他的伪造“罪状”是不成立的。日本共产党议员于一日在国会发表声明，指出日本议会“传讯”德田的策动，是那些被中苏条约的签订和日皇裕仁罪行的揭露而被逼走头无路的反动势力的一个反苏反共的运动。其用意是企图阻挠共产党领导日本人民走向独立与和平。
    另据塔斯社东京消息：吉田政府检察总署已下令取缔日共在山形市和大阪县布施市等六地的地方组织，借口是它们没有按照政府一九四九年四月颁布的所谓“团体管制法”登记。日本共产党已正式提出抗议，谴责吉田政府此举是企图宣布共产党为非法的一个步骤。
