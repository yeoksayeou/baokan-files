    坚决制止战贩战争阴谋
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社巴黎六日讯：数千法国劳动人民五日在巴黎郊区蒙特鲁歇的巴法罗运动场，举行盛大集会，庆祝即将到来的国际妇女节。与会者携带着各色的标语和口号：如“打倒大西洋公约！”“给越南以和平！”“禁止原子弹！”“建立民主统一的政府！”等。戈登夫人在开幕词中称：法国妇女将贡献出一切力量，以求得在法国建立和苏联一样的无剥削的社会。法国妇女联盟的戈斯兰讲述苏联妇女在加强苏联的威力和提高苏联人民生活水准的斗争中的巨大努力。当她谈到苏联最近又一次的降低物价时，听众发出了暴风雨般的欢呼声。法共议员维美徐称：“我们在这里集会，是为了要反对法国政府正在执行着的战争、贫困和叛卖我国民族利益的政策而斗争。和我们的丈夫、兄弟和儿子在一起，我们就拥有足够的力量，能摧毁战争贩子们的计划。”
