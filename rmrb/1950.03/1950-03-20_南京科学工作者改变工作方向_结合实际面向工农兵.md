　　Nanjing Scientific Workers Change Work Direction
　　Integrating with Reality and Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
　　Geological experts and engineers cooperate with workers and peasants; medical workers go deep into rural areas and the army, achieving significant gains.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] "Closely integrate scientific work with practical life and better serve the people" - This is the direction of future efforts that Nanjing scientific workers have derived from participating in the actual work of factories, rural areas, and the army. Currently, Nanjing's scientific research institutions include the former Academia Sinica under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Nanjing Agricultural Science Research Institute under the East China Region, the former Chinese Geographical Research Institute, the Central Geological Survey, the Mineral Survey and Exploration Office, the Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Institute, the Radar Research Institute, the Central Water Conservancy Experiment Office, the Central Hygiene Experiment Institute, the Chinese Special Drug Research Institute, and other units such as major universities, colleges, factories, enterprises, farms, and hospitals, totaling approximately three to four thousand scientific workers. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, these scientific institutions were decorations and tools for officials to climb the ladder and seek profit. Science was divorced from the people, as Professor Fan Qianzhong of Jinling University said: "After holding an annual meeting each year, there was nothing else to do." After liberation, under the guidance and help of the People's Government, Nanjing's scientific workers gradually embarked on the road of serving the people, changing the direction and methods of research work.
　　Farmers Assist in Prospecting and Discover Important Mineral Deposits
　　In geological research, Nanjing's geologists have gone to Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and other provinces to conduct prospecting work since liberation. In the development of their work, they have received sincere help from the local farmers due to their integration with them, and have achieved many results. For example, when experts such as Zeng Dingqian from the Geological Survey first arrived in the mountainous areas of northern Anhui, the people were very distant from them. They patiently explained their intentions to the people and told them: "If mineral deposits are found, it will benefit the country. If the People's Government mines them, you will have jobs in the future." Therefore, nearby farmers told them and guided them to explore, resulting in the discovery of valuable bentonite. The discovery of this bentonite will greatly contribute to the development of the petroleum industry and is important for filtering petroleum. The institute discovered potassium alum mines in the vicinity of Nanjing, which made a great contribution to the fertilizer industry. The Mineral Survey and Exploration Office discovered vermiculite mines in Jiaodong for the first time, which is the best fireproof building material. Recently, Nanjing geologists have accepted the commission of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and organized a prospecting agency of more than eighty people to go to the Northeast, North China, Central South, and other regions to explore iron ore and non-ferrous metal mines such as copper, lead, and zinc. Li Chunyu, director of the Geological Survey, and his party left Nanjing in the first batch on the 6th. Under the old Kuomintang reactionary rule, engineers were separated from or even opposed to workers. However, under the leadership of the People's Government, due to the implementation of the policy of combining science and workers, engineers and workers have demonstrated a high degree of cooperative spirit in production. In the past, workers at the Nanjing Radio Factory were only treated as accessories to machinery, and no one taught them basic scientific knowledge. Last August, at a production review meeting, workers in the motor group requested to learn scientific knowledge, which was valued by the factory's technical experts. Engineer Zhao Xiuxian and others immediately organized a motor learning class, lecturing to the workers and studying with them. In the past six months, the workers have learned the basic common sense of electricity, alternating current circuits, an overview of telecommunications, the structural principles of vacuum tubes, etc., and will continue to learn the structural principles of radios and transmitters. Learning is completely integrated with production; the workers learn whatever they do; therefore, their production achievements have also improved very quickly. In the past, for every one hundred radios produced, forty or fifty had problems and had to be redone; now, because of scientific knowledge, many old problems have been eliminated. Therefore, Engineer Zhao Xiuxian said: These examples have educated us that science must be combined with workers for production to be successful.
　　Workers Having Scientific Knowledge Reduces Defects in Manufacturing Parts
　　The staff of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of the Nanjing Agricultural Science Research Institute are going deeper into the countryside to serve farmers. On November 1st last year, after learning that rinderpest had been discovered in Shangxikou, Xiuning County, southern Anhui, the office sent experts to the area to carry out prevention and control work, convened symposiums for rural association cadres and cattle farmers, and invited the owners of cattle with the plague to attend, explaining in detail the pathology of rinderpest and the way germs spread; at the same time, farmers were asked to look at the microscope to see the blood smears coated with anthrax germs magnified. After seeing it, the farmers understood the principle of germ transmission, which greatly helped the prevention and control work. Wang Jinjin, the owner of a dead cow, said: "My cow died of illness, I can't let it spread and harm others." So he dug a pit and buried the dead beef that he was going to sell, preventing the spread of rinderpest.
　　Medical Workers Go Deep into the Army and Gain Experience in Preventing and Controlling Schistosomiasis
　　In the field of medicine, Nanjing's medical community has organized epidemic prevention teams to go to the countryside to vaccinate farmers and inject preventative shots, and to go to factories and schools to check the health of workers and students. Last autumn, Japanese schistosomiasis was prevalent in a People's Liberation Army unit. In January of this year, Nanjing's medical and health circles formed a prevention and treatment brigade to serve the army. The participants included professors and experts, physicians, nurses, and students such as Wu Zaidong, Yang Yi, Chen Zida, and Mao Shoubai, totaling more than 300 people. These medical workers had made very good preparations beforehand, such as practicing injection techniques and studying the larvae of schistosomiasis. In actual work, they also showed a high degree of work enthusiasm. For example, Cheng Xiyu, a physician at Gulou Hospital, insisted on giving injections to soldiers even when he was sick himself; the ward of a certain squadron was more than three miles away from the doctor's residence, and Professor Yang Yi of Nanjing University went to see the soldiers in the rain. In this work of going deep into the army, medical workers not only took a step forward in their political thinking, but also gained a lot in medical research. From this experience of treating Japanese schistosomiasis, they came to a conclusion on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.
　　In addition, Nanjing's scientific workers also participated in various practical work of the People's Government. This spring, when Nanjing was building river embankments, scientists and students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering and the Department of Civil Engineering of Nanjing University organized a surveying team to participate in the work. Health institutions throughout the city responded to the call of the Refugee Handling Committee and formed medical teams to go to various dike sections to serve the refugees building the dikes. Disasters were severe in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, and the staff of Nanjing agricultural research institutions working in those areas conducted on-the-spot investigations and studies, and lived with the disaster victims, eating soybean cakes, wild grass, bark, and peanut shells. Last summer, a large part of a certain PLA unit was infected with malaria, and experts from the Nanjing Hygiene Experiment Institute went to the troops to assist in carrying out a surprise treatment and successfully completed the task.

　　南京科学工作者改变工作方向
    结合实际面向工农兵
    地质专家、工程师与工农合作，医务工作者深入农村、部队，均有重大收获。
    【新华社南京十七日电】“把科学工作和实际生活密切结合起来，更好地为人民服务”——这是南京科学工作者从参加工厂、农村、部队的实际工作中得出的今后的努力方向。现在南京的科学研究机构有中央人民政府科学院所属的前中央研究院、华东区所属的南京农业科学研究所、前中国地理研究所、中央地质调查所、矿产测勘处、科学仪器制造所、雷达研究所、中央水利实验处、中央卫生实验院、中国特效药研究所等和各大专学校、工厂企业、农场、医院等单位，共约有科学工作者三四千人。在过去国民党反动统治时代，这些科学机构是国民党反动派的装饰品和升官营利的工具，科学脱离了人民，正如金陵大学范谦衷教授所说：“每年开一次年会后便无事可为”。解放后，南京市的科学工作者在人民政府的指导与帮助下，逐步地走上了为人民服务的道路，改变了研究工作的方向和方法。
    农民协助探矿发现重要矿藏
    在地质学的研究工作上，南京的地质学者解放以后曾先后分赴江苏、山东、安徽等省，进行探矿的工作。在工作开展中，由于和当地农民相结合，获得了农民的真诚帮助，得到不少成绩。如地质调查所曾鼎乾等专家刚到皖北山地工作时，老百姓对他们很疏远。他们曾耐心地对老百姓说明来意，并告诉他们：“如果找到了矿藏，就是国家的好处。人民政府开矿，你们以后也就有工做了”。因此，附近农民告诉他们，并引导他们去探寻，结果发现了可贵的班脱岩。这种班脱岩的发现，将极有助于石油工业的发展，对滤石油有重要作用。该所在南京附近一带，发现了钾矾矿，对肥料工业有很大的贡献。矿产测勘处在胶东首次发现蛭石矿，这是最好的防火建筑材料。最近南京地质学者又接受了中央重工业部的委托，组织了一个八十余人的探矿机构，分赴东北、华北、中南等区探测铁矿和铜、铅、锌等有色金属矿，地质调查所李春昱所长等一行已于六日首批离宁出发。在旧国民党反动统治下，工程师是与工人脱节甚至对立的。但在人民政府领导之下，由于实行科学和工人结合的方针，工程师和工人在生产事业中发挥了高度合作的精神。南京无线电器厂的工人在过去只作为机械的附属品，从没有人教他们学习基本的科学知识。去年八月在一次生产检讨会上，电机组工人提出要求学习科学知识，得到厂内技术专家的重视。工程师赵修贤等即举办了电机学习班，替工人上课，和工人一同研究。半年多以来工人们已学习了电学的基本常识、交流电路、电讯概论、真空管构造原理等，并将继续学习收音机及发射机的构造原理。学习完全与生产结合起来，工人们做什么就学什么；因此他们的生产成绩进步也非常快。过去每制成一百部收音机，总有四、五十部有毛病，必需重做；现在因为有了科学知识，许多老毛病都免除了。因此，赵修贤工程师说：这些事例已经教育了我们，科学必须要与工人结合，生产才能搞好。
    工人有了科学知识制造机件毛病减少
    南京农业科学研究所畜牧兽医系的工作人员更深入乡村，为农民服务。去年十一月一日，该处得悉皖南休宁县上溪口发现牛瘟后，即派专家赶赴该处，进行防治工作，召集各乡农会干部、养牛户开座谈会，并邀瘟牛的畜主列席，详细解释牛瘟的病理及病菌传染情形；同时请农民看显微镜，把涂有炭疽病菌的血片放大给农民看。农民看后懂得了病菌传染的道理，对防治工作帮助很大。死了牛的畜主王进金说：“我的牛病死了，不能让他传染再害人家。”于是他便将准备卖钱的死牛肉挖坑埋掉，防止了牛瘟的蔓延。
    医药工作者深入部队，防治血吸虫病获经验
    在医药工作方面，南京的医学界曾经组织了防疫队下乡为农民种牛痘、注射防疫针，到工厂、学校替工人学生检查健康情况。去年秋天，人民解放军某部队中普遍传染日本血吸虫病，南京医药卫生界于今年一月组成了防治大队赴部队服务，参加的有吴在东、杨宜、陈子达、毛守白等教授和专家、医师、护士学生等三百余人。这些医药工作人员在事先都进行了很好的准备工作，如练习注射技术和研究血吸虫的幼虫等。在实际工作中，他们也表现了高度的工作热忱。如鼓楼医院医师承锡玉自己生病，还坚持替战士们打针；某中队病房离医生住处有三里多，南京大学杨宜教授冒雨去给战士们看病。医学工作者在这次深入部队的工作中，不仅在政治思想上提高了一步，并在医学研究上也得到了很大的收获。从这次医治日本血吸虫病的经验中，他们得出了防治血吸虫病的结论。
    此外，南京科学工作者还参加了人民政府各项实际工作。如今春南京修筑江堤，科学家和南京大学水利系、土木系的学生就组织测量队参加工作。全市卫生机构响应难民处理委员会的号召，组成医疗队赴各堤段替修堤难民服务。皖北、苏北等地灾荒严重，南京农业研究机构在各该地工作的人员，曾进行实地调查研究，并和灾民一道过吃豆饼、野草、树皮、花生壳等的生活。去年夏天解放军某部大部感染了疟疾，南京卫生实验院专家们便亲往部队协助进行突击治疗，胜利完成任务。
