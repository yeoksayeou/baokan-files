[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education and Culture convened a meeting on the 9th with approximately 200 people, including principals, academic affairs directors, political instructors, and student representatives from private middle schools throughout the city. Director Weng Dujian and Deputy Director Hou Junyan explained the 1950 work plan for private secondary schools. Director Weng first stated that in running private middle schools, it is necessary to recognize the essence of education, overcome detachment, and serve the new democratic society. Private middle schools should make the greatest efforts to overcome current difficulties and reduce the burden on the state. Deputy Director Hou then reported on the 1950 educational work plan for private middle schools: 1. The educational policy is to further rectify and transform on the existing foundation. It is imperative to strictly implement new education policies and laws, continue to improve teachers' political and professional studies, improve teaching, and strengthen students' political and ideological education and cultural and scientific level. 2. Clarify the principal responsibility system, strengthen administrative leadership, and the main task of middle school principals is to plan, supervise, and inspect the educational work of the school. 3. Organize and lead political and professional studies for in-service faculty and staff, enabling them to study and use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods to conduct teaching work; and implement a planned system of specialized teachers. 4. Conscientiously carry out internationalist and patriotic education, eliminate reactionary ideas, consolidate the revolutionary outlook on life, and develop the idea of serving the people; clarify the tasks of political instructors and reduce excessive burdens; schools run by religious organizations must not include religious subjects in the curriculum and must not hinder students' freedom of belief. 5. Organize vegetable production to improve the lives of students and staff and develop a labor perspective. 6. Practice strict economy and establish the idea of building the school; tuition standards should take into account students' ability to pay and the school's expenditures, and appropriate regulations should be adopted through consultation. 7. Develop technical education, encourage and assist private middle schools with the conditions to develop technical education, and the government will provide subsidies to those who have achieved results but have financial difficulties. 8. Encourage private schools to increase the number of classes, and the government will provide appropriate subsidies for the added classes; schools should pay attention to enrolling children of the working people, and those with attached workers' children's classes should continue to enroll workers' children.
