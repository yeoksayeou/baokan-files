Xinhua News Agency, March 29th -- The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions regarding the production of hemp, tobacco, and silk in 1950. According to the current needs of industrial production and the situation of foreign sales, the instructions stipulate the following production targets for hemp, tobacco, and silk this year: (1) Hemp: The main focus this year is to increase the production of jute, kenaf, and ramie (green hemp). In 1950, the Northeast region should produce 320,000 *shi dan* of kenaf, 300,000 *shi dan* of ramie, and 830,000 *shi dan* of flax; East China should produce a total of 800,000 *shi dan* of jute, kenaf, and ramie; North China should produce 250,000 *shi dan* of ramie, and plan to propagate kenaf; Central South China should make appropriate arrangements based on the actual needs of its hemp textile industry; and the Northwest region should conduct adaptability tests of kenaf in a planned manner. (2) Tobacco: Tobacco production must achieve self-sufficiency in cigarette raw materials. In 1950, the focus is on maintaining the 1949 flue-cured tobacco production area and striving to expand the cultivation area. This year, the cultivation area for flue-cured tobacco should reach 300,000 *mu* in Henan, 200,000 *mu* in Shandong, and 100,000 *mu* in Anhui. In addition, tobacco experimental farms and farms in tobacco-producing areas with tobacco experimental tasks should strengthen the breeding and propagation of improved flue-cured tobacco varieties, striving to generally replace seeds with improved varieties in major tobacco-producing areas within two years. (3) Silk: In 1950, silk production should maintain the original production level, protect existing mulberry gardens and oak forests, cultivate new mulberry seedlings to gradually renew mulberry gardens; strengthen silkworm breeding farm management, expand the manufacturing of improved silkworm eggs to gradually eliminate native varieties. Oak silkworm areas can appropriately develop according to their specific conditions.

　　农业部发布指示
    规定今年麻、烟草、蚕丝生产任务
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府农业部顷发布关于一九五○年麻、烟草及蚕丝生产的指示。该指示根据当前工业生产的需要和外销的情况，规定今年麻、烟草及蚕丝的生产为：（一）麻：今年主要是增加黄麻、洋麻、莔麻（青麻）的生产量。一九五○年内，东北应生产洋麻三十二万市担，莔麻三十万市担，亚麻八十三万市担；华东应生产黄麻、洋麻、莔麻共八十万市担；华北区应生产莔麻二十五万市担，并有计划地繁殖洋麻；中南区应根据其麻纺织工业的实际需要作适当的布置；西北区应有计划地进行洋麻适应性的试验。（二）烟草：烟草生产须达到卷烟原料的自给自足，一九五○年以保持一九四九年烤烟生产面积为主，并争取扩大栽培面积。今年烤烟的栽培面积，河南应达到三十万亩，山东应达到二十万亩，安徽应达到十万亩。此外，各地烟草试验场和负有烟草试验任务的产烟区农场，都应加强烤烟良种的培育和繁殖，以争取两年内在主要烟产区普遍换种良种。（三）蚕丝：一九五○年蚕丝生产应维持原有的生产水平，并保护现有桑园柞林，培育新的桑苗，以逐步更新桑园；加强蚕种场管理，扩展改良蚕种制造，以逐步消灭土种。柞蚕区则根据其具体条件，可适当地进行发展。
