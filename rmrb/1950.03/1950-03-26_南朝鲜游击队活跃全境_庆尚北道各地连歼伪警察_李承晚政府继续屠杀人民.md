Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 25th, via TASS reports: South Korean people's guerrillas have been active throughout South Korea in March. In Gyeongsangbuk-do, people's guerrillas eliminated a puppet police suppression team in the Mudo area on March 2nd; on March 3rd, they routed the majority of the 25th Regiment of the South Korean puppet defense forces in Changsu District, Yeongdeok County. In Danyang County, Chungcheongbuk-do, guerrillas annihilated a puppet "suppression team" on the 3rd. In Gangwon-do, guerrillas active in the Daebaeksan area routed the main force of two regiments of the puppet army's 28th Division in the Eosan area and pursued them.

In addition, summarizing reports from TASS, New York, March 10th and 16th, citing the New York Times correspondent in Seoul: In South Korea, taxes levied by the Syngman Rhee "government" on farmers account for 70 percent of their grain harvest. Politically, the Syngman Rhee puppet government is adopting fascist means to suppress political opposition. Although the correspondent slanders the fighters for national independence in Korea, he is compelled to admit that an unparalleled atmosphere of terror pervades many areas of South Korea. He wrote: "People captured by Syngman Rhee's troops are brought to their native villages, executed without trial or investigation, and their bodies are tied to trees as a warning to others." Despite this, he found that the guerrilla movement in rural South Korea remained very strong. He wrote: "The guerrillas continue their fight. The police build solid stone bunkers, but this does not mean that the people's guerrilla movement can be easily suppressed."

　　南朝鲜游击队活跃全境
    庆尚北道各地连歼伪警察  李承晚政府继续屠杀人民
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社平壤十三日消息，南朝鲜人民游击队三月份活跃于南朝鲜全境。在庆尚北道，人民游击队于三月二日在武度地区消灭了一支伪警察讨伐队；三月三日在盈德县苍水区击溃了南朝鲜伪国防军第二十五联队的大部。在忠清北道丹山县，游击队于三日歼灭了一伪“讨伐队”一队。在江原道，活动于大白山一带的游击队，于鹅山地区击溃了傀儡军第二十八师两个团的主力，并加以追击。
    另综合塔斯社纽约十日及十六日电引美国纽约时报驻汉城记者报道称：在南朝鲜，为李承晚“政府”向农民所征收的捐税，占了农民谷物收获的百分之七十。政治方面，李承晚傀儡政府正采取法西斯手段镇压政治上的反对派。该记者虽然谩骂朝鲜的争取民族独立的斗士，但却不得不承认南朝鲜的许多地区正弥漫着举世无匹的恐怖。他写道：“李承晚军队所捕获的人们，被带到他们的原籍的村庄里，不经审判或调查即行处死，并将尸体缚在树上，作为对他人的一种警告。”虽然如此，他发觉南朝鲜农村中的游击运动依然甚为强大。他写道：“游击队继续他们的战斗。警察建筑坚固的石头碉堡，并不表示人民的游击运动能轻易被压服下去。”
