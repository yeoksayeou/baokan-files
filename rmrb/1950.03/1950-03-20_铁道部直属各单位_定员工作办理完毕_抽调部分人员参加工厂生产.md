　　Ministry of Railways Directly Subordinate Units
    Staffing Work Completed
    Some Personnel Transferred to Factory Production
    [Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government completed its internal staffing work on the 24th of last month. The original establishment of staff in the various bureaus within the ministry was 2,700 people. Under the principle of not hindering work, and after repeated careful calculations, a reorganization and streamlining was carried out. As a result, the number of personnel was reduced by 477, and the current established number of personnel within the ministry is 2,223. In this staffing work, staff in various sections were appropriately reassigned according to actual work needs, some non-production personnel were transferred to production operations, and some temporarily unnecessary institutions were cut and merged, reducing a large amount of national expenditure. First, the ministry organized a staffing review committee to study the work and staffing of each unit in detail. Then, the following streamlining measures were adopted: 1. In terms of institutions, such as the Legal and Military Affairs Sections, if they can be temporarily suspended, they will be immediately suspended. If the work of the Personnel Section, Labor Wage Section, or Secretary Section, Personnel Section of each bureau can be temporarily merged, temporary mergers will be implemented. If the Engineering Bureau needs to add a Communications and Signaling Section due to work needs, it will be added. 2. Some department personnel are transferred to be paid for by enterprise departments. For example, most of the personnel in the Livelihood Section are transferred to be paid for by supply stores; some personnel in the Materials Bureau are transferred to be paid for by local offices. 3. A large number of administrative affairs department personnel are reduced. The Reception Section (including seven guest houses, four dormitories, and two collective canteens) originally paid for by the ministry alone had 177 people. During this staffing, the staff of the guest houses, dormitories, and canteens were reduced, and the ministry only bears the expenses of 23 people. The expenses of personnel exceeding the establishment should be borne jointly by the people living in the guest houses, dormitories, and dining in the canteens because the ministry implements a salary system. It is estimated that the administrative expenses of the Ministry of Railways alone can save more than 38,000 jin of rice per month. In addition, young and strong people among the document, affairs, and odd-job personnel are transferred to factories to participate in production or sent to various training classes to learn technical skills; their work is shared by older people. Among them, the number of orderlies alone is reduced by one-third. 4. Each unit is equipped with personnel according to the complexity of its work tasks. And research and improve working methods to save manpower. Originally, the Technical Planning Section of the Technical Department of the Transportation Bureau had seven people, each in charge of one external bureau. Later, it was readjusted according to the nature of the work, and as a result, four people shared the work of the above seven people. After such careful calculation, the established number of personnel in the Transportation Bureau was reduced from the original 222 to 193. In addition, the number of people is also reduced for work that is currently needed but cannot be launched for a while due to objective conditions, and only preparatory work is done. For example, the Industrial Statistics and Wage Statistics Sections of the Statistics Department only set up a few people to do preparatory work because the work cannot be launched immediately.
    In addition to reorganization and streamlining, some departments of the Ministry of Railways headquarters have also achieved results in terms of savings. The most significant example is the ministry's automobile workers, whose class consciousness has greatly improved since liberation. Drivers voluntarily led workers to repair 17 cars that were originally considered unusable during the Kuomintang rule using waste materials. The use of gasoline has also decreased month by month. When it was originally taken over, each gallon of gasoline could only run 24 Chinese miles, but by December of last year, it had increased to 40 Chinese miles per gallon, and now it has reached 42 Chinese miles. The reason for the large savings in gasoline is that the ministry's automobile workers have established the concept of cherishing national property. They must make the best use of everything when driving, and do not allow a drop to be wasted. Another reason is that the phenomenon of stealing oil has disappeared. Some workers said: "In the Kuomintang era, it was incompetent not to steal gasoline, but now stealing gasoline has become a shame." (Yu Ming)

　　铁道部直属各单位
    定员工作办理完毕
    抽调部分人员参加工厂生产
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部部内定员工作，业于上月二十四日办理完毕。该部内各局工作人员原编制为二千七百人，在不妨碍工作的原则下，经过一再的精打细算，实行整编精简，结果减少人员四百七十七人，现部内定员人数共为二千二百二十三人。在这次定员工作中根据实际工作需要，适当地调配了各部分工作人员，把一部分非生产人员转入生产业务，并裁减合并一些暂时可以不要的机构，减少了国家大量开支。首先，部内组织了编制审查委员会、逐一详细研究每一个单位的工作与编制。然后采取了以下几种精简办法：一、机构方面，如法律、军事两处，目前能够不设立即不设立。各局人事课、劳动工资课或秘书课、人事课工作，能够暂时合并者，实行暂时合并。如工程总局因工作需要增设通讯号志课，则予以增设。二、有些部门人员划归企业部门开支。如生计处大部分人员，划归供给商店开支；材料局部分人员划归各地办事处开支。三、大量减缩行政事务部门人员。原由部内开支的招待课（包括七个招待所，四个宿舍，两个集体食堂）人员，就有一百七十七人，此次定员时，将招待所宿舍食堂工作人员加以缩减，部内只负担二十三人的费用，超过编制人员的费用，因该部实行薪金制，应由住招待所、住宿舍及食堂用膳人员共同负担。据估计，铁道部的行政开支，仅此一项，每月就可省米三万八千余斤。此外，文牍、事务、勤杂人员中之年轻力壮者，抽调工厂参加生产或送各种训练班学技术业务；其工作则由较年老者分担。其中只勤务员即减少三分之一。四、每一单位均按工作任务繁简配备人员。并研究改善工作方法以节省人力。原来运输局技术课的技术计划股有七个人，每人管一外局，后来按工作性质重新调整，结果四个人就分担了上述七个人的工作。运输局经过这样精打细算，定员人数由原编制二百二十二人，减为一百九十三人。此外，对目前虽属需要作的工作，但因客观条件限制不能一时展开者，也减少人数，只作准备工作。如统计处产业统计、工资统计二课，因工作不能立时展开，就只设少数人作准备工作。
    铁道部本部除整编精简外，在节约方面，某些部门也有成绩。最显著者为该部汽车工人，在解放以后，阶级觉悟大大提高，司机自动带领工人，用废料修好原被国民党统治时认为不能用的汽车十七部。在用汽油方面，也逐月减少。在原来接收时，每加仑汽油只能跑二十四华里，到去年十二月提高到每加仑汽油跑四十华里，现在则已达四十二华里。大量节省汽油的原因，是因该部汽车工人树立了爱护国家财产的观念。平时开车必使物尽其用，不让滥费一滴，另一原因则是偷油现象没有了，有的工友说：“在国民党时代，不偷汽油是无能，现在偷汽油就变成耻辱了。”（于明）
