　　A World of Poverty and Disenfranchisement
　　Lieon Jiéyefū
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th) The Pravda recently published a special article by Lieon Jiéyefū entitled "A World of Poverty and Disenfranchisement," describing the poverty, hunger, and lack of political rights of the masses in colonies and semi-colonies, countries now dependent on U.S. imperialism, West European countries, and the United States of America.

　　Lieon Jiéyefū wrote that after the Second World War, the economic situation in the colonies and semi-colonies greatly deteriorated. The countries that occupy colonies ruthlessly plunder these colonies in order to improve their own situation. Granting some British colonies a fake "independence" has not deprived British capitalists of the huge profits they derive from various enterprises and plantations in these colonies.

　　A few days ago, news of famine came from Nyasaland (British North Rhodesia in Africa), a British colony, where thousands of natives starved to death. The British authorities, who had food reserves available, refused to alleviate the suffering of the residents.

　　In the Union of South Africa, the average income of European workers is ten times higher than that of African workers doing the same work.

　　The residents of Malaya are also starving, while British monopoly capitalists are making huge profits from Malaya by exporting rubber and tin to the United States. Workers and peasants who dare to participate in trade union movements, political demonstrations, or strikes are slaughtered by the colonial police and local reactionary authorities.

　　In Indonesia, 25,000 patriots have been killed or imprisoned in just one year.

　　Many trade union leaders in South Korea have been tortured or executed.

　　In India, tens of thousands of active participants in the trade union movement have been imprisoned.

　　In Japan, under the iron heel of the American occupiers, workers are also subjected to insane oppression. The number of unemployed there has reached seven million, and workers and peasants fighting against hunger and poverty are subjected to brutal persecution.

　　The plight of the people of Latin American countries, oppressed by U.S. monopoly capital, makes the overall picture of poverty and disenfranchisement in the dependent world even more terrifying. The terrorist fascist dictatorships of Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, and Peru, which carry out the will of U.S. monopoly capitalists, have deprived the people of these countries of their basic democratic rights, driven the Communist Party underground, and sold out their countries' national wealth.

　　The decline in mass living standards and the complete loss of political rights for working people are characteristic of all countries dependent on U.S. imperialism, such as Greece, Iran, Turkey, and South Korea.

　　Even in 1947, the real wages of workers and staff in Greece were only 76 percent of the 1938 standard. In 1948, real wages fell to 62 percent, and in 1949 to 52 percent.

　　The lives of the working people of Iran are not much better. Even now, the landlords in Turkey still have the power of life and death over the peasants who live in abject poverty. In Spain, Portugal, and Yugoslavia, fascist rule is being carried out. The living standards of the masses in those countries have fallen to unprecedented lows. It is enough to mention that the residents of Spain are also starving, and due to fascist persecution, the peasants have reduced the wheat planting area by half. Since 1936, prices have increased eightfold, while wages have only doubled.

　　As for the "living standards" in Western European countries, they have been constantly declining since the war. In 1948, real wages in France were only half of what they were before the war, in Italy they were 73 percent of what they were before the war, and in West Germany they did not exceed two-thirds of the abject poverty level of the Hitler era in 1938. British workers currently receive only about 60 percent of the food they received in the crisis-ridden years before the war.

　　However, the pace of impoverishment is accelerating. Following the currency devaluation last autumn, prices in all Marshall Plan countries have soared. New tragic news arrives every day: from January 30th, the price of the Paris subway and suburban trains increased by 40 percent. The price of sugar in Norway has risen by 20 percent since February 13th. Unemployment in capitalist countries is also increasing rapidly.

　　The situation of the people in European capitalist countries, as well as Canada and Australia, is rapidly approaching the degree of poverty and disenfranchisement that U.S. imperialism has established in Latin America, Greece, Turkey, and other dependent countries, as well as other "areas where American capital is applied."

　　Lieon Jiéyefū emphasized the hardships suffered by the working people of the United States. Millions of Americans live in abject poverty. The army of fully and partially unemployed already numbers 14 million, and is increasing daily.

　　The unprecedented development of the colonial national liberation movement, the great struggle of democratic forces in various capitalist countries, and the major strikes by American workers that are shaking the lair of imperialist reaction, all show that the situation in the entire capitalist world is extremely tense, and hundreds of millions of people are fighting for peace, for democratic rights, and for the right to live like human beings.

### 贫穷和没有权利的世界

　　贫穷和没有权利的世界
    列昂捷夫
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二月二十四日电：真理报顷刊载列昂捷夫以《贫困和没有权利的世界》为题的专论，描述殖民地和半殖民地、现在依附美国帝国主义的国家、西欧各国与美利坚合众国中广大群众的贫困、饥饿与毫无政治权利的情形。
    列昂捷夫写道，在第二次世界大战之后，殖民地与半殖民地的经济情况大大地恶化了。占有殖民地的国家，无情地掠夺这些殖民地，以便改善它们自己的情况。给某些英属殖民地以假“独立”，并未剥夺掉英国资本家们在这些殖民地里从各种企业与种植园得来的巨额利润。
    几天之前，灾荒的消息从英属殖民地尼亚萨兰（非洲英属北罗得西亚）传来，那里饿死了数以千计的土人。有存粮可拨用的英国当局拒绝缓和居民的苦难。
    在南非联邦，欧洲工人的平均收入比作同样工作的非洲工人的收入高十倍。
    马来亚的居民也在挨饿，英国独占资本家由于向美国输出橡胶和锡而从马来亚获得巨额的利润。凡敢于参加工会运动、政治示威或罢工的工人与农民，都被殖民者的警察与地方反动当局所杀戮。
    在印度尼西亚，仅在一年期间，就有两万五千名爱国者被杀害或被投入监狱。
    南朝鲜的许多工会领袖遭到酷刑或处死。
    在印度，囚禁了数以万计的工会运动的积极参加者。
    在美国占领者铁蹄下的日本，工人们也遭到疯狂的压迫。那里的失业人数已达七百万，为反饥饿与贫困而进行斗争的工人农民受到残酷的迫害。
    受美国垄断资本压迫的拉丁美洲各国人民的处境，使附属国世界的那幅贫困与没有权利的总的画面显得更加可怕。执行美国垄断资本家意愿的智利、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、阿根廷及秘鲁的恐怖法西斯独裁，剥夺了这些国家人民的基本民主权利，把共产党赶入地下，并出卖它们国家的国民财富。
    大众生活标准的下降和劳动人民政治权利的完全丧失，是目前依赖美帝国主义者的一切国家——希腊、伊朗、土耳其、南朝鲜等国的特点。
    甚至在一九四七年，希腊的工人和职员的实际工资就仅有一九三八年标准的百分之七十六。一九四八年，实际工资降至百分之六十二，一九四九年降至百分之五十二。
    伊朗劳动人民的生活也并不好一些。直到现在，土耳其的地主们对于过着赤贫生活的农民还操有生杀予夺之权。在西班牙、葡萄牙和南斯拉夫，正在进行着法西斯的统治。在那些国家里的大众的生活标准，已下降到空前未有的低下水准。只消提到这一点就够了，西班牙的居民也在受饥饿，由于法西斯的迫害，农民们已减少了小麦种植面积的一半。自一九三六年以来，物价增长了八倍，而工资仅增加了一倍。
    至于西欧国家内的“生活标准”，战后一直在不断下降。在一九四八年，法国的实际工资仅为战前的一半，在意大利为战前的百分之七十三，而在西德并未超过一九三八年希特勒统治时代那种赤贫水平的三分之二。英国工人目前仅能得到他们在战前充满危机的几年里所得到的食粮的百分之六十左右。
    但是，贫困化的步伐是愈来愈迅速了。继去年秋天货币贬值之后，各马歇尔化国家的物价都已暴涨。每天都有新的悲惨的消息到来：从一月三十日起，巴黎的地下电车和市郊火车涨价百分之四十。挪威的糖价自二月十三日起涨价百分之二十。资本主义国家的失业也在迅速增加。
    欧洲资本主义国家以及加拿大、澳大利亚的人民群众所处的境地，迅速在接近美帝国主义在拉丁美洲、希腊、土耳其等附属国以及其他“应用美国资本的范围”内所建立的那种贫困和无权利的程度。
    列昂捷夫强调指出美国劳动人民所遭受的艰苦。数以百万计的美国人生活在赤贫之中。完全失业和部分失业的大军，即使在目前就已达一千四百万，而且还每日都在增加。
    殖民地民族解放运动规模空前的发展，各资本主义国家民主力量的伟大斗争，以及正在震撼着帝国主义反动巢穴的美国工人的大罢工，这一切表明了整个资本主义世界的形势已极端紧张，亿万的人民在为和平，为民主权利，为像人一样地生活的权利而斗争。
