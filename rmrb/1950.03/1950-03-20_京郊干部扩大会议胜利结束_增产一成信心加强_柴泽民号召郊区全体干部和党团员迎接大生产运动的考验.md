The Enlarged Meeting of Suburban Beijing Cadres Successfully Concludes
　　Increased Production by 10% Confidence Strengthened
　　Chai Zemin Calls on All Suburban Cadres and Party Members to Meet the Test of the Great Production Movement
[Reported by this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The enlarged meeting of district and village cadres in the suburban areas of Beijing, which lasted for three days, concluded successfully on the 18th. The meeting successively heard a report and summary by Chai Zemin, secretary of the Suburban Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on launching a large-scale agricultural production movement to ensure a 10% increase in production this year. On the second day of the conference, district and village cadres conducted in-depth discussions in their respective districts. After the meeting, all suburban areas will hold village cadre meetings at the district level; each district will hold farmer representative meetings at the administrative village level to continue implementing the spirit of the conference and convey this year's agricultural production plan in suburban Beijing to all cadres and farmers to ensure the completion of this year's task of increasing production by 10%.
　　The main achievement of this meeting was to further enhance the understanding among district and village cadres in the suburban areas of Beijing that, with the basic successful completion of land reform, the central task of focusing all efforts on leading the emancipated farmers in production is the most important political task at present; at the same time, it clarified that focusing all efforts on "organizing" the farmers is a key to completing the increase in production. Prior to this, a small number of cadres believed that after five months of intense land reform work, they could "take a rest"; more people saw the difficulties in this year's production, such as the lack of fertilizer, livestock, and farm tools, and lacked confidence in increasing production by 10%, while at the same time harboring the idea of relying on loans from higher levels. After discussion and careful calculation, these ideas were generally corrected, and it was further clarified that leading farmers in production is the only way to enable farmers to completely turn over a new leaf, and they generally gained confidence in completing the task of increasing production by 10%. Taking the 19th District as an example: After discussion and careful calculation, the cadres of the district believe that although the district currently has only one-tenth of the required fertilizer, if they "organize," they can have 200 carts go to the city to haul ditch mud. The fertilizer effect of each ton of ditch mud is equivalent to 500 jin of dried manure. In one month, they can haul 3,000 tons of ditch mud, which is equivalent to increasing fertilizer by 600,000 jin. This item alone can increase the production of millet by 220,000 jin. In addition, precise calculations on organizing labor mutual aid, universally developing supply and marketing cooperatives, strengthening sideline production, and building water conservancy projects have led the vast majority of cadres to quickly shift from a lack of confidence to full confidence in this year's task of increasing production by 10%; only individual units, due to insufficient leadership attention and lack of detailed research on various specific tasks, still have cadres with the phenomenon of emphasizing difficulties and insufficient confidence in increasing production. Regarding the organization of sideline production, everyone believes in the discussion that it is not only an effective way to overcome disasters, but more importantly, it can solve the farmers' difficulties in lacking means of livelihood and help them accumulate capital. Therefore, organizing sideline production well is one of the important tasks to ensure the completion of this year's production task. Chai Zemin focused on this opinion in his concluding report at the conference, thereby raising the work of organizing sideline production to its proper position.
　　In the concluding report made on the last day of the conference, Chai Zemin, in addition to explaining the significance and precautions of specific tasks such as organizing labor mutual aid, universally developing supply and marketing cooperatives, strengthening sideline production, and issuing loans, emphasized that production work mainly depends on the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly convey the government's production policies to the masses through village farmer representative meetings, and to eliminate some ideological concerns that may exist among the masses in future practical actions and implement the government's production policies. Finally, he called on all cadres, Communist Party members, and members of the Communist Youth League in the suburbs to humbly learn production knowledge and meet the test of the great production movement for everyone. On the last day of the conference, Chen Fengtong, director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Wang Chun, director of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and He Shenggao, director of the Third Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also attended and spoke. When explaining issues such as seed selection, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and livestock diseases, Chen Fengtong pointed out that the current solution to these problems mainly depends on the experience and methods of farmers, and expressed that the institute will vigorously support the suburban Beijing production increase movement to closely combine scientific knowledge with the government's organizational work. In his speech, Wang Chun explained in detail the principles and steps for the universal development of supply and marketing cooperatives, and pointed out that the current task of suburban supply and marketing cooperatives is to serve agricultural production. In his speech, He Shenggao pointed out that suburban security work is closely related to agricultural production, and the security organs will always eliminate obstacles in production and ensure the smooth progress of production work.

### 京郊干部扩大会议胜利结束  增产一成信心加强  柴泽民号召郊区全体干部和党团员迎接大生产运动的考验

　　京郊干部扩大会议胜利结束
    增产一成信心加强
    柴泽民号召郊区全体干部和党团员迎接大生产运动的考验
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：历时三日的北京市郊区区、村干部扩大会议于十八日胜利结束。会议先后听取了中共北京市委会郊委书记柴泽民关于开展农业大生产运动，保证今年增产一成的报告及总结。大会第二日各区区、村干部并分别在各该区进行了深入的讨论。会后全郊区将以区为单位召开村干部大会；各区将以行政村为单位普遍召开农民代表会议，继续贯彻大会的精神，将京郊今年的农业生产计划深入传达到全体干部与农民中去，以保证完成今年增产一成的任务。
    这次会议的主要收获是：使全郊区区、村干部进一步认识到在基本上已经胜利完成土地改革的北京郊区全力领导翻了身的农民努力生产是压倒一切的中心工作，是当前头等重要的政治任务，同时明确了全力将农民“组织起来”是完成增产的重要关键。在此以前曾有少数干部认为经过了五个月土地改革的紧张工作，可以“歇一歇了”；更多的人看到今年生产中缺乏肥料、牲畜、农具等的困难，对增产一成的信心不足，同时存在着依赖上级贷款的思想，经讨论与精打细算后普遍纠正了这些想法，进一步明确了领导农民搞好生产才能使农民彻底翻身，对完成增产一成的任务也普遍有了信心。以十九区为例：该区干部经讨论与精打细算后认为全区现有肥料虽仅十分之一，但是如果“组织起来”可有二百辆大车进城拉沟泥，每吨沟泥的肥效等于粪干五百斤，一个月后，可拉沟泥三千吨，等于增肥六十万斤，仅此一项即可增产小米二十二万斤，再加上对于组织劳动互助，普遍发展供销合作社，加强副业生产，兴修水利等具体工作的精密计算，使绝大多数干部对于今年增产一成的任务由缺乏信心迅速转为信心百倍；只有个别单位，由于领导上重视不够，对各项具体工作没有精细研究，因之干部思想中仍然存在着强调困难的现象，增产信心仍然不足。关于组织副业生产，在讨论中大家认为不仅是度过灾荒的有效办法，更重要的意义还在于它能解决农民缺乏生活资料的困难，它能帮助农民积累资金，因此好好组织副业生产是保证完成今年增产任务的重要工作之一。柴泽民在大会总结报告中集中了这个意见，从而把组织副业生产的工作提高到了应有的地位。
    柴泽民在大会最后一日所作的大会总结报告中，除再度说明组织劳动互助，普遍发展供销合作社，加强副业生产，发放贷款等具体工作的意义与应行注意事项外，着重指出生产工作主要须依靠群众，因此必须通过村农民代表大会，将政府的生产政策切实地深入到群众中去，并在今后实际行动中来解除群众中可能存在的一些思想顾虑，贯彻政府的生产政策。最后他号召郊区全体干部，共产党员和青年团员虚心学习生产知识，迎接大生产运动给予每一个人的考验。会议最后一日尚有华北农业科学研究所所长陈凤桐、北京市供销合作总社主任王纯与市公安局第三处处长贺生高出席讲话。陈凤桐在说明选种、防治病虫害与家畜疾病等问题时，指出目前要解决这些问题主要须依靠农民的经验与办法，并表示该所决大力支持京郊增产运动，使科学知识与政府的组织工作密切结合起来。王纯在讲话时详细说明了普遍发展供销合作社的方针与步骤，并指出当前郊区供销合作社的任务就是为农业生产而服务。贺生高在讲话时指出郊区治安工作和农业生产有密切关系，治安机关一定随时扫除生产中的障碍，保证生产工作的顺利进行。
