On "Secret History of the Qing Court"
    Ya Qun

    "Secret History of the Qing Court" is a historical film produced by Hong Kong's Yonghua Company, depicting the struggle between Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi in the late Qing Dynasty. Although the form of this struggle is manifested in a simple court struggle, becoming a family affair of the rulers at the time, from the perspective of historical development, it should be acknowledged that, at a certain historical stage, it was a political struggle between progress and backwardness, reform and conservatism. At that time, under the continuous aggression of various imperialist powers, the feudal ruling class was divided into two factions: one faction, represented by Cixi, reflected the thinking of landlords and bureaucrats, stubbornly maintaining the status quo with feudal conservatism and arrogance; the other faction, represented by Guangxu, reflected the thinking of the emerging, nascent bourgeoisie at the time, accepting the so-called "civilization" of capitalism to a certain extent, trying to catch up and achieve self-strengthening. Although both factions struggled to consolidate the rule of their own class, in terms of the significance of historical development, Guangxu had a certain degree of progressiveness. He was an emperor with patriotic ideas, but he simply relied on a few children of his own class (Kang Youwei, etc.) and speculative bureaucrats (such as Yuan Shikai), so he was so weak and powerless that he was suppressed by the opposition without any achievements. Today, we can only view this film from this perspective to make sense, and we will not be misled by the playwright's excessive affirmation of Guangxu, thinking that Guangxu was a remarkable emperor, and simply attributing his failure to Yuan Shikai's betrayal.

　　对《清宫秘史》的看法
    亚群
    《清宫秘史》是香港永华公司出品的，描写清末光绪和慈禧太后之间斗争的历史故事片。这斗争的形式虽是表现在单纯的宫庭斗争，成为当时统治者的家事，但从历史发展的观点去看，应当承认：在一定的历史阶段内，是进步和落后，改革和保守的政治斗争。当时，中国在各帝国主义不断的侵略下，封建统治阶级内部分成了两派：一派以慈禧为代表，反映了地主官僚的思想，顽固地以封建主义的保守和自大来维持现状；一派以光绪为代表，反映了当时新兴的，萌芽期的资产阶级的思想，在一定的限度内接受了资本主义的所谓“文明”，想迎头赶上，以图自强。两派虽同是为了巩固本阶级的统治而斗争，但在历史发展的意义上说，光绪是有他一定限度的进步性的。他是一个有爱国思想的皇帝，但他只单纯地依靠几个本阶级的子弟（康有为等）和投机的官僚（如袁世凯），所以他是如此软弱无力，毫无成就地就被反对派压下去了。今天，我们只能以这个观点去看这部影片，才有意义，才不会被剧作者过分地肯定光绪的描写所迷惑，而认为光绪是个了不起的皇帝，把他的失败简单地归咎于袁世凯的出卖。
