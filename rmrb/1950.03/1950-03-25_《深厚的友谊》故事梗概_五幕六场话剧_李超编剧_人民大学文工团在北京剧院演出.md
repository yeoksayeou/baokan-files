A five-act, six-scene play, written by Li Chao, performed by the People's University Cultural Troupe at the Beijing Theater.
　　The Northeast's largest railway locomotive repair factory, under the long-term rule and corruption of the enemy, had backward management systems and working methods, and its production level lagged far behind military needs and economic construction. It was only after the arrival of Soviet expert Comrade Surovsky that new factory management systems and working methods were proposed.
　　Ren Qiuming, a young, enthusiastic, and ambitious college graduate in engineering, newly transferred from the South as the head of the production section, was dissatisfied with Surovsky's suggestions and his pragmatic work style, believing he was an obstacle to his development. Ren was a narrow nationalist.
　　Bao Yonggang, an old worker who had previously contracted work at Ren Qiuming's father's factory, was stubborn and inflexible, an empiricist with a technocratic viewpoint. He disagreed with the use of electric welding for the boiler's spiral bands, insisting on using rivets. With the approval of the factory director and the expert, he and his nephew Wang Faming were divided into two shifts, using both new and old working methods to work on two boilers simultaneously.
　　The new working method was not easily accepted, the work was slow, the output was low, and the piece-rate wage system was to be changed, which reduced the income of the workers, causing dissatisfaction. When a military task arrived, requiring the urgent manufacture of twenty fifty-ton oil tank cars within three weeks, Comrade Surovsky proposed the use of forming dies to shorten working hours and improve work. Materials were also scarce, and the large steel plates for locomotive manufacturing could not be wasted for smaller uses. Inspired by the Soviet comrades, they dug through the scrap iron pile to solve the problem, and finally discovered many iron plate curved beams above the air-raid shelter. With the active leadership of Party and Youth League members and the enthusiastic work of the workers, one car was produced every ten hours, ten times faster than before, and the task was completed in the final days of the three weeks.
　　Old worker Bao Yonggang completed his boiler one day ahead of schedule, but there were fifteen leaks. The factory director removed him from his position as squad leader, and Surovsky also criticized Section Chief Ren for underestimating the workers' invention of the spring box and for his irresponsibility in this work. Bao's daughter, Guizhi, a female lathe operator personally trained by Surovsky, was injured in a competition, which further increased Bao Yonggang's dissatisfaction with Su. Wang Faming's boiler was completed on schedule and inspected as Grade A under eighteen atmospheres of water pressure. Bao was not convinced and wanted to personally test it again using the new method. Three days later, it was also inspected as Grade A, fully confirming the scientific nature of the new working method. The facts convinced him of the error of his empiricism.
　　A large number of new machines arrived from the Soviet Union, and the brake factory was established. Wang Faming's spring box was also successfully tested. The technology of the entire factory was generally improved, strengthening the workers' confidence in improving technology and making inventions. Old Bao was also convinced of Surovsky's technology, especially inspired by Su's active and selfless work ethic and with the help of Party Secretary Qian, he recognized the error of working for personal gain and developed class consciousness. He applied to join the Party.
　　Ren Qiuming was moved by these facts, especially by the fact that Comrade Surovsky was helping China as if he were building his own motherland. This deep international friendship made him feel that he should stand with the great proletariat. He embraced Comrade Surovsky, thanking him and Party Secretary Qian for their help and education, and criticized his own narrow nationalism as the residue of bourgeois ideology.

　　《深厚的友谊》故事梗概
    五幕六场话剧  李超编剧
    人民大学文工团在北京剧院演出
    东北某大铁路机车修造厂，在敌人长期统治和腐蚀下，管理制度和工作方法都很落后，生产水平远落在军事需要和经济建设后面。只有苏联专家苏洛夫司基同志来到以后才提出新的工厂管理制度和新的工作方法。
    任秋明，青年，热情，有抱负，大学工科毕业，刚从南方调来的生产科长，不满苏洛夫司基的建议和他实事求是的工作作风，认为是他发展的障碍，任是一个狭隘的民族主义者。
    曾经在任秋明的父亲工厂里包活的老工友——包永刚，执拗，倔强，是一个唯技术观点的经验主义者，他不同意锅炉丝带用电焊的工作法，坚持要用铆钉铆，经厂长和专家同意，与他外甥王法明分两班，用新旧两种工作法同时作两台锅炉。
    新工作法不容易被接受，工作慢，出活少，又要改计件工资制，工友的收入减少，引起不满。军事任务来了，要在三星期之内赶造二十辆五十吨的油罐车，为缩短工时，改进工作，苏洛夫司基同志提出作胎的方法，而材料又是困难，不能将作机车的铁板大材小用，经苏联同志的启示，去挖废铁堆解决困难，终于在防空壕上面发现很多铁板弯梁子，在党、团员积极带头和工友们热情工作中，每十小时出一台，比过去快十倍的速度，在三星期的最后几天完成了任务。
    老工人包永刚提前一天完成了他的一台锅炉，但有十五处泄漏，厂长撤了他班长的职务，苏洛夫司基也批评了任科长轻视工友发明弹簧盒子的创造，和对这次工作的不负责任，包的女儿桂枝，是苏洛夫司基亲手培养的女旋盘工，因在竞赛工作中受伤，更使包永刚对苏不满。王法明的一台锅炉，如期完成，在十八个罗水压下检了甲级，包不服，要用新方法亲自试验一次，三天后，也检了甲级，完全证实新工作法的科学，事实说服了他经验主义的错误。
    苏联运到了大批新机器，制动机厂建立起来了，王法明的弹簧盒子也试验成功，全厂技术普遍提高，坚定了工友们改进技术和创造发明的信心，老包也信服了苏洛夫司基的技术，尤其在苏积极忘我的工作精神感召和钱党委的帮助下，认识了为个人打算的错误，有了阶级觉悟，他申请入党了。
    任秋明被这些事实感动了，尤其是苏洛夫司基同志像建设祖国一样的帮助中国，这种深厚的国际友谊，使他觉得应该站在伟大无产阶级一起，他拥抱了苏洛夫司基同志，感谢他和钱党委对他的帮助和教育，批判了自己狭隘的民族主义是资产阶级思想的残余。
