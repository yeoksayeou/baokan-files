　　Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The French authorities in Vietnam are actively using the Kuomintang bandit troops who fled to Vietnam to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is reported that the French authorities in Vietnam have re-armed 3,000 Gui bandit troops who fled to Vietnam and ordered these bandit troops to occupy Thai Binh Province. Recently, more than 1,000 French troops and Gui bandit troops gathered in Lang Son, attempting to attack the Vietnamese liberated areas between Zhennanguan and Aidian. In addition, a part of the Gui bandit troops led by Wu Hongqing, the leader of the Vietnamese Kuomintang, has been reorganized into the puppet "Vietnam Founding First Army" with the consent of the French military authorities. The remnants of Gui bandit Yao Huai (former Longzhou Commissioner) were reorganized into the "Vietnam Founding Second Army," which has been transferred to the area between Qixi and Naling, northwest of Lang Son, to harass the Viet Minh army. French aircraft dropped military blankets and wooden boxes to Yao's bandits over the area on February 13th and 20th. At present, Agence France-Presse and the Central News Agency of the bandits are systematically fabricating rumors that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has entered Vietnam as a pretext for the French army in Vietnam to incorporate the bandit troops who fled to Vietnam.

　　逃越国民党匪军  法帝利用作炮灰
    【新华社二十四日讯】越南法国当局积极利用逃越国民党匪军进攻越南人民共和国。据息：越南法当局已将逃越桂匪军三千人重新武装，并令该部匪军进占太平省。最近曾有法军及桂匪军各千余人集结谅山，企图向镇南关与隘店间的越南解放区进攻。此外，由越南国民党首领武鸿卿所率领的一部分桂匪部队，已经法军当局同意改编为伪“越南建国第一军”，桂匪姚槐（原匪龙州专员）残部被编为“越南建国第二军”，该部已被调往谅山西北的七溪、那岭间向越盟军进扰。法国飞机曾于二月十三日及二十日在该地上空给姚匪投掷军毯、木箱等物。现法新社及匪中央社正有计划地捏造所谓中国人民解放军进入越南的谣言，以作越南法军收编逃越匪军的借口。
