　　Examples of Reports Lacking Authenticity
　　Editor

　　The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Freedom to report true news shall be protected." Many journalists have made considerable achievements in this regard. However, a few newspapers are not good at correctly using this freedom. They have adopted an insufficiently serious attitude towards news reporting and published some untrue news.

　　Based on some materials from October 1949 to January 1950, many reports lacking authenticity appeared in certain newspapers. To make it easier to attract the attention of readers, this time, we mainly cite some examples of military news.

　　In the reports about the Guangzhou Campaign, a Shanghai newspaper published a "Hong Kong Dispatch" on October 15, citing news from the Sing Tao Daily, saying: "The People's Liberation Army has entered the outskirts of Guangzhou. General Chen Geng's troops are advancing in two routes, and the three cities of Shantou, Qingyuan, and Huizhou have been captured successively." But in fact, Huizhou (Huiyang) was liberated on the 15th, and Shantou was liberated on the 24th.

　　In the reports about the Guangxi Campaign, the same newspaper published a "Hong Kong Dispatch" on October 23, saying: "The People's Liberation Army is sweeping away the remnants of the Gui clique like a whirlwind, directly attacking Guilin, the last nest of the Gui bandit gang." On October 25, a Nanjing newspaper reprinted this news, and at the same time published a "Shanghai Dispatch" saying: "According to a Hong Kong dispatch on the 22nd: Our army is pursuing the remnant bandits in Guangxi in two routes. The main Xiang-Gui line has entered Guangxi, with the vanguard reaching Quanxian County. On the Xijiang River front, our army has reached Deqing, southeast of Wuzhou." But in fact, the Guangxi Campaign had not yet begun at that time. The advance into Guangxi started on November 7, and Guilin was liberated on November 22. On November 8, the Nanjing newspaper again carried a Hong Kong dispatch on the 7th saying that Maoming and Lianjiang were liberated on the 4th, but Maoming had already been liberated on the 2nd.

　　In the reports about the Sichuan-Guizhou Campaign, the Nanjing newspaper continuously published more than ten "Hong Kong Dispatches" in a very prominent position from November 5 to December 1, many of which were untrue. For example, it published on the 5th, "Badong was declared liberated on the evening of the 2nd," but Badong was liberated at 12:00 noon on the 3rd. It published on the 10th, "Our army reached Xiushan in eastern Sichuan on the 8th, and the county was liberated at noon on the 9th." In fact, Xiushan had already been liberated on the 7th. It published on the 13th, "The army entering Sichuan has occupied Longtan and is approaching Youyang," but Youyang had already been liberated on the 12th. It published on the 15th that our army reached Qianjiang on the 13th, but Qianjiang had already been liberated. The same newspaper published on the 16th that Qianjiang was liberated on the 12th, which contradicted the previous dispatch. On December 1, it carried "Chongqing was liberated at 9:00 am on the 29th," but Chongqing was liberated on the afternoon of November 30. The aforementioned Shanghai newspaper also published some telegram reports on the Sichuan-Guizhou Campaign. On November 16, it also published a Hong Kong dispatch, quoting "news from foreign news agencies this afternoon," saying that battles had occurred in the suburbs of Guiyang, but Guiyang was liberated on the 15th, not just "battles occurred in the suburbs."

　　In the reports about the Chengdu Campaign, the aforementioned Nanjing newspaper continuously published many "Hong Kong Dispatches" in December, reporting on the Chengdu Campaign, many of which were wrong. For example, it published on the 3rd, "Rongchang and Longchang were liberated one after another yesterday," but Longchang was actually liberated on the 5th. On the 4th, it published a Hong Kong dispatch on the 3rd, saying: "The army advancing towards Chengdu is advancing rapidly along the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, sweeping everything before it. It has reached Neijiang yesterday, and it is generally believed that the good news of the liberation of Chengdu will be obtained soon." In fact, the "good news of the liberation of Chengdu" arrived three weeks later. On the 8th, it published a Hong Kong dispatch on the 7th, saying, "Our army has reached Zigong City," but Zigong City had already been liberated on the 5th. On the 27th, it said: "Our army entered Chengdu on the 24th," but Chengdu was liberated on the 27th. On January 10 this year, the newspaper published another Hong Kong dispatch on the 9th, saying that "Our army based on the Leizhou Peninsula launched two attacks in the areas east and west of Haikou on the 7th." The attack on Hainan Island is one of the major military operations in the future, and it is not appropriate to publish news so rashly. In fact, the newspaper does not really know the military situation on the Leizhou Peninsula.

　　Regarding the situation of air traffic, another Shanghai newspaper made a very inappropriate report. The newspaper published a Beijing dispatch on the 3rd on January 4, saying: "Hong Kong News: Liu Jingyi recently wrote from Guangzhou to his colleagues of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) remaining in Hong Kong, reporting the resumption plan. He said: The government has approved the resumption of two routes in January this year, (1) Tianjin to Guangzhou via Zhengzhou, Hankou, and Hengyang; (2) Tianjin to Chongqing via Xi'an." A Beijing dispatch reports the news of the Central People's Government, but the source is in Hong Kong. This kind of reporting is not serious and responsible.

　　The continuous occurrence of the above-mentioned reports shows that some of our journalists still have bourgeois journalistic views in their minds. More importantly, the newspapers concerned did not immediately make serious corrections to these errors, which further indicates that they have not developed a serious and responsible spirit. This is enough to greatly reduce the credibility of newspapers among readers.

　　Untrue reports should be resolutely opposed.

　　缺乏真实性的报道举例
    编者
    人民政协共同纲领规定：“保护报道真实新闻的自由”。许多新闻工作者在这方面有了不少成绩。但是少数报纸，还不善于正确地使用这种自由。他们对新闻报道采取了不够严肃的态度，发表了一些不真实的新闻。
    根据一九四九年十月至一九五○年一月间一些材料，某些报纸上出现了不少缺乏真实性的报道。为了更容易引起读者的注意起见，这一次主要举些有关军事新闻的例子。
    在关于广州战役的报道中，上海有一家报纸十月十五日发表十四日“香港专电”，引用星岛日报消息说：“人民解放军业已进入广州外围，陈赓将军所部分两路南进，汕头、清远、惠州三城已先后攻占。”但实际上惠州（惠阳）是十五日解放的，汕头则是二十四日解放的。
    在关于广西战役的报道中，同报十月二十三日发表“香港专电”说：“解放军以疾风卷落叶之势，直捣桂系匪帮最后巢穴的桂林。”十月二十五日南京有一家报纸转载了这一则消息，同时刊出“上海专电”说：“据香港二十二日电：我大军两路向广西残匪追击，正面湘桂线已进入广西境，前锋抵全县，西江方面我军已抵梧州东南的德庆。”但实际上，那时广西战役还未开始。进军广西是十一月七日开始的，解放桂林则在十一月二十二日。十一月八日南京的这一家报纸又载香港七日专电说，茂名、廉江于四日解放，但茂名二日就已经解放了。
    在关于川黔战役的报道中，南京的这一家报纸自十一月五日至十二月一日，以极显著地位连续发表“香港专电”十余则，其中有许多是不真实的。如五日刊载“二日晚巴东宣告解放”，但巴东是三日上午十二时解放的。十日刊载“我军八日进抵川东秀山，该县于九日中午解放”。实际上，秀山在七日就已经解放了。十三日刊载“入川大军已占领龙潭，迫近酉阳”，但酉阳十二日已经解放了。十五日刊载十三日我军进抵黔江，实际上黔江已经解放了。同报十六日又载十二日解放黔江，与前电自相抵触。十二月一日载“重庆二十九日上午九时解放”，但重庆系于十一月三十日下午解放。前述上海那一家报纸也刊载了一些电讯报道川黔战役情形，十一月十六日并刊出香港专电，引用“今午外国通讯社消息”，说贵阳城郊已发生战事，但贵阳恰好是十五日解放的，不止是“城郊已发生战事”。
    在关于成都战役的报道中，前述南京的一家报纸在十二月一个月中连续发表了许多“香港专电”，报道成都战役，其中很多是错的。如三日载“昨日又先后解放荣昌隆昌”，隆昌实际上是五日解放的。四日发表香港三日专电说：“向成都挺进大军正沿成渝公路疾进，一路势如破竹，昨已进抵内江，一般相信即日可获成都解放之佳音。”实际上“成都解放之佳音”迟了三个礼拜才到来。八日发表香港七日专电说“我军已进抵自贡市”，实际上自贡市五日已经解放。二十七日则说：“我军已于二十四日攻入成都”，而成都却是二十七日解放的。今年一月十日该报又发表香港九日专电一则，说“以雷州半岛为基地的我军，七日曾在海口以东以西地区两度试行攻击”。进攻海南岛是今后重大军事行动之一，不宜这样轻率发表消息。事实上，雷州半岛的军事情况如何，该报也并不真正知道的。
    关于航空交通状况，上海的另一家报纸作了一次很不妥当的报道。该报于一月四日发表北京三日专电说：“港讯：刘敬宜近自穗书告中航留港同人，报告复航计划。他说：政府已核准今年一月先恢复两条航线，（一）天津经郑州、汉口、衡阳至广州；（二）天津经西安至重庆。”北京专电报告中央人民政府的消息，而来源却在香港，这种报道是不严肃负责的。
    上述这些报道之所以连续发生，说明我们有些新闻工作者在思想上还存在着资产阶级新闻观点。更重要的是，有关报纸对于这些错误，没有即时进行严肃的更正，这更加表示没有养成认真负责的精神。这是足以大大减低报纸在读者中的威信的。
    对于不真实的报道，应当坚决加以反对。
