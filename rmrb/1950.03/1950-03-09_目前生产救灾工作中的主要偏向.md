Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th: According to materials recently received here, the following deviations are quite widespread in many regions in production and disaster relief work, seriously affecting the progress of production and disaster relief work, and urgently need to be corrected quickly.

The first deviation is that the leading organs in some areas only pay attention to severely affected areas and neglect lightly affected areas, resulting in the expansion of disasters in lightly affected areas, turning them into severely affected areas. For example, in Fengnan County (formerly the southern part of Fengrun County), Hebei Province, among seven lightly affected areas with 297 lightly affected villages, only 2,520 households of grain-deficient farmers subsisted on bran and vegetables in early December last year, but by early February of this year, the number had increased by nearly threefold. The most important reason for the aggravation of the disaster is that the county's leading organs put all their efforts into a few severely affected areas, while abandoning leadership in production and disaster relief work in general lightly affected areas. For example, in Zhao Ge Zhuang, originally 81 farming households made their living by twisting hemp ropes as a sideline, but due to the lack of government leadership, the number gradually decreased to only two households. In Hao Jia Zhuang in the same county, originally 27 households wove mats, but they all stopped working later due to lack of leadership. Similar deviations have also occurred in Baoying, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Yangzhou and other places in northern Jiangsu, resulting in the expansion of disasters in lightly affected areas.

The second deviation is that in some severely affected areas, emphasis is only placed on organizing sideline production without paying attention to combining it with spring plowing. This phenomenon exists in parts of Chahar and Hebei Province. For example, the production plan formulated by Hebei Province from last winter to this year's wheat harvest emphasized sideline production, but rarely mentioned the most important issue during this period—spring plowing. The main reason for this deviation is that cadres in some areas only see the benefit that sideline production can easily solve the immediate living difficulties of disaster victims, while ignoring that the fundamental way to overcome disasters is to rely on agricultural production.

The third deviation is that disaster relief work is not yet good at utilizing the role of cooperatives. Many cadres in some areas are still accustomed to using administrative methods and are not good at organizing the masses to engage in production and disaster relief through cooperatives. For example, in Huiji County, Shandong Province, disaster victims initially showed great enthusiasm for sideline production, but due to the lack of overall planning and organization by cooperatives, sales stagnated and production could not continue. Recently, the following phenomenon occurred in eastern Hebei: the government overcame various difficulties to transport relief grain to the disaster-stricken villages, but because there was no organization and leadership from cooperatives, the disaster victims had to carry the grain back to the market to exchange for means of production. Merchants took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the farmers suffered great losses. After the merchants bought the grain at low prices, they transported it back to the cities in large quantities from the rural market, resulting in a reverse flow of grain between the disaster areas and non-disaster areas.

If the above-mentioned deviations are not quickly overcome, given that the spring famine season has arrived, it will greatly increase the difficulty of disaster relief work and affect the completion of this year's production tasks.

### 目前生产救灾工作中的主要偏向

　　目前生产救灾工作中的主要偏向
    【新华社北京八日电】根据最近到达此间的材料，不少地区在生产救灾工作中相当普遍地存在着以下几种偏向，严重地影响着生产救灾工作的进行，亟须迅速予以纠正。
    第一个偏向是若干地区的领导机关仅仅注意了重灾区而忽视了轻灾区，结果轻灾区灾情扩大，变成重灾区。如河北省丰南县（原丰润县南部）七个轻灾区二百九十七个轻灾村，去年十二月初以糠菜度日的缺粮农民仅有两千五百二十户，但到今年二月初旬，即增加了将近三倍。灾荒加重的最主要的原因就是该县领导机关把全部力量都投入了少数重灾地区，而放弃了对一般轻灾区的生产救灾工作的领导。其中如赵各庄原来有八十一户农民以打麻绳为副业，由于缺乏政府的领导，逐渐地减少得只剩了两户；该县郝家庄原来有二十七户编席子，也由于缺乏领导，后来都停了工。在苏北宝应、兴县、高邮、扬州等地也发生同样的偏向，结果轻灾灾情扩大。
    第二个偏向是在若干重灾区只着重组织副业生产而未注意和春耕相结合。察北和河北省的部分地区均有此种现象。如河北省所制订的去年冬季至今年麦收前的生产计划中强调了副业生产，而对这一期间最重要的一个问题——春耕工作则很少提及。产生这一偏向的主要原因在于若干地区的干部只看到副业生产容易解决灾民眼前生活困难的好处，而忽视了战胜灾荒的根本办法是依靠农业生产。
    第三个偏向是在救灾工作还不善于发挥合作社的作用，不少地区的干部仍只习惯于运用行政方法而不善于通过合作社来组织群众从事生产救灾。如山东省惠济县灾民对副业生产最初热情很高，但由于缺少合作社的通盘计划与组织，结果销路停滞，生产无法继续。最近冀东则发生了这样的现象，政府克服种种困难把救济粮运到了灾村，因无合作社的组织领导，灾民不得不又把粮食背到市场上去交换生产工具，商贩乘机低价收购，农民受到很大损失。而商人低价收购粮食后，又从农村市场大批运回城市，结果形成灾区与非灾区粮食倒流的现象。
    上述偏向如不迅速加以克服，在目前春荒季节已来到的情况下，必将大大增加救灾工作的困难，并影响今年生产任务的完成。
