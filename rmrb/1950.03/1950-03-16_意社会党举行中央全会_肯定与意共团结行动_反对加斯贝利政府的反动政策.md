　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 13th: Tass reported from Rome on the 13th that the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party held a plenary session in Rome, according to Avanti! Party Secretary Nenni, as well as Morandi and Lisade, gave reports respectively on political issues, organizational issues, and administrative issues.

　　In his report, Nenni stated: According to the recently concluded 1950 membership registration, the Italian Socialist Party now has 655,818 members. The Italian Socialist Party has entered a period of ascent, "It has resolutely defended its position, struggled against opportunists, and strengthened class consciousness and discipline within the party ranks, and the party is now reaping the fruits of this position."

　　Nenni continued, pointing out that the achievements of the Socialist Party in Italy prove and reflect the failure of the degenerate policies of other social reformists in Italy. The crisis of the various right-wing socialist groups and factions in Italy is linked to the general crisis of the right-wing socialist parties in Europe. This general crisis can be demonstrated by the fate of the French Socialist Party and the results of the British general election.

　　Speaking of the domestic situation in Italy, Nenni emphasized that De Gasperi's new government heralds a further intensification of social and political struggles. The report compiled by the Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives on the implementation of the Marshall Plan in Italy shows that the De Gasperi government must strengthen its struggle against the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and all unwavering democratic elements.

　　Nenni affirmed the complete solidarity and unity of action between the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Communist Party, and emphasized the need to strengthen the opposition to the De Gasperi government and its current policies. Nenni stated that the main tasks of the Italian Socialist Party in the next few months are: to seize land through land occupation methods, to strive for agricultural employment regulations, and to strive for land reform; workers to conduct struggles to defend their class achievements in factories, to oppose production cuts, to oppose layoffs, and to strive for maximum employment; to strive for peace, to oppose the political and military obligations undertaken by the government, and to struggle for the comprehensive consolidation of the peace movement.

    反对加斯贝利政府的反动政策
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社罗马十三日讯：据前进报报道，意大利社会党中央委员会在罗马举行全会。党书记南尼以及摩兰地、李莎第分别作了关于政治问题、组织问题和行政问题的报告。
    南尼在报告中称：按照刚刚结束的一九五○年党员登记，社会党党员现已达六十五万五千八百一十八人。意大利社会党已进入一个上升的时期，“它曾坚决保卫自己的立场，对机会主义者进行斗争，加强党阵营里的阶级觉悟和纪律，而党现在就收获着这种立场的果实”。
    南尼继指出：社会党在意大利的成就，证明并反映了意大利其他社会改良主义者的堕落政策的失败。意大利各个右翼社会党集团、派系的危机，是和欧洲各右翼社会党的总危机联系着的。这一总危机，由法国社会党的命运和英国大选的结果可以证明。
    论到意大利国内形势，南尼强调：加斯贝利的新政府，预告着社会斗争和政治斗争将进一步加剧。美国众院小组委员会所编纂的关于马歇尔计划在意大利实施情况的报告，说明加斯贝利政府必须加强对共产党、社会党和一切坚持不渝的民主分子的斗争。
    南尼肯定了意大利社会党与意大利共产党两党的完全团结和行动一致，并强调必须加强反对加斯贝利政府及其现行政策。南尼称：意大利社会党下几个月里的主要任务是：用占地方法争取土地，争取农业雇用条例，争取土地改革；工人们进行斗争，以保卫他们在工厂里的阶级成果，反对减缩生产，反对解雇、争取最大限度的就业；争取和平，反对政府所承担的政治军事义务，为全面地巩固和平运动而斗争。
