Several Experiences in Political Education of a Certain Division in North China

(1) Clearly understand the purpose of political education, closely link it with thinking, and connect it with reality.

The purpose of political education is to improve the political understanding of cadres and soldiers, enhance their class consciousness and policy level, resolve muddled thinking, broaden their horizons, thereby increasing the work enthusiasm and initiative of cadres and soldiers, unleashing greater creativity, transforming thinking, and improving work efficiency. To achieve this goal, teaching must firmly grasp the methods of linking with thinking and connecting with reality, and promptly correct dogmatism and empiricism in learning; and criticize methods such as perfunctory testing, rote memorization, and reading aloud from the book. Only in this way can political education be effective.

(2) Adhere to and strengthen education preparation meetings to specifically solve the difficulties of company political instructors in lecturing.

At present, the general political theory level of company political instructors is relatively low, and they lack teaching experience. Only by strengthening the education preparation meetings at the battalion and regimental levels can this deficiency be compensated. At the education preparation meetings, it is necessary to study the key points and teaching methods of the teaching, as well as the issues that should be paid attention to in the implementation of the teaching, based on the content of the textbook. The experience in the first phase of military training proves that units that have adhered to this system better have fewer difficulties in lecturing for company political instructors and achieve greater results.

(3) Strengthen specific preparation work before teaching.

After the education preparation meeting, each teacher must, before teaching, make further specific preparations based on the spirit of the text and in light of the specific conditions of the unit. The content of personal preparation should grasp the following key points: 1. Read the text, familiarize yourself with the content, and understand and grasp the spirit of the text. 2. According to the spirit of the text, in light of the unit's ideological situation and level of understanding, draft a teaching outline. 3. According to the teaching purpose and teaching outline, study and determine the method of lecturing. How to lecture? How to guide everyone to connect with reality? How to arouse everyone's interest in listening to the lecture? These should be flexibly used in the implementation of teaching according to the prepared outline.

(4) Several effective methods in the implementation of education.

A. Contrast education: List the contrasts of specific things, enlighten the soldiers, and enable them to recognize the truth and falsehood of things from their personal experiences, improve their understanding, and enhance their class consciousness. For example, through the contrast between the liberated areas and the areas occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, the contrast between the People's Government and the puppet "government," the contrast between the People's Liberation Army and the Chiang bandit army, as well as the contrast between the enemy and our conscription system, officer-soldier relations, and army-civilian relations, etc., all have significant educational significance for the soldiers. This experience has proven successful in grievance-airing education, the first phase of military training education, and the study of CPPCC documents.

B. Hold soldiers' speech meetings: The method of speech meetings is to educate soldiers with the understanding of soldiers. Because the content and language of the soldiers' speeches are closest to the soldiers, the soldiers listen to them most kindly and easily receive the effect. At the same time, it can promote everyone to connect with their own thoughts and understanding, and exercise their ability to think and speak. However, speech meetings must be conducted purposefully, preparedly, organizedly, and with leadership in order to achieve good results. Before the speech meeting, it is necessary to determine the center: What kind of thinking is required to be implemented? What problem is required to be solved? And notify everyone to prepare. After brewing and preparation are mature, then convene it. Leading cadres must participate in the meeting to discover and solve problems. The order of speeches should be arranged in advance. During or after the speech, a special person should be responsible for leading everyone to shout slogans according to the central content of the speech. If the speech meeting is properly prepared and the organization is tight, the meeting will be tense, lively, and vivid. Some troops adopted this method in the course of the CPPCC study and achieved great results. The soldiers reflected: "Open more meetings like this, everyone is not restrained, says what they have to say, and everyone has the opportunity to exercise!"

C. Focus on praise and establish good role models. Experience proves that the method of more praise is better than the "big exposure" method used in the past. In the process of studying a certain problem, according to the teaching purpose and requirements, select role models from the company through mass comparison and evaluation, as the "banner" for everyone to strive for, which greatly establishes the company's righteousness, cracks down on evil, inspires everyone's upward heart, and realizes the purpose of education. For example, in our regularized education, we adopted this method: according to the standards of regularization, first make a report, and then launch a bottom-up "comparison and evaluation" (this "comparison and evaluation" should focus on establishing role models and promoting good things), to produce the role model of the whole squad; then, through the platoon's role model comparison and evaluation, to produce the role model of the platoon; and then use this to produce the role model of the whole company. The number of company role models can be unlimited, depending on the actual situation. After such role models are produced, everyone will find a role model to learn from.

(5) Master several specific issues of discussion meetings:

First of all, teachers and study group leaders should hold a good preparation meeting, clarify the purpose of the discussion, formulate discussion questions that can cause controversy and inspire free thought; and further study the specific methods of how to enlighten and guide. Secondly, in the discussion, the group leader should be good at controlling the meeting. When the group leader inspires everyone to speak, especially when senior cadres come to the meeting, they often easily produce an anxious mood, forcing everyone to speak, forming a "shift system." Conversely, it is to let it go, let it flow, these two deviations directly affect the effect of the discussion meeting, and should be avoided. Thirdly, the group leader should be good at discovering problems, grasp the focus of the debate, and raise it for everyone to launch a debate, so that incomplete or wrong views can come to more complete and correct conclusions. Fourthly, a conclusion must be made after the discussion. According to everyone's discussion, indicate where the differences lie, criticize erroneous understandings, summarize everyone's opinions, make everyone's opinions more systematic, and raise them to the level of principles.

　　华北某师政治教育的几点经验
    （本报通讯员白烽）
  （一）明确认识政治教育的目的，紧密联系思想，联系实际。
    政治教育的目的，是提高干部与战士的政治认识，提高其阶级觉悟和政策水平，解决糊涂思想，扩大眼界，由此而提高干部、战士的工作热情与积极性，发挥更高的创造性，改造思想，提高工作效能。要想达到这一目的，在教学上必须紧紧掌握联系思想、联系实际的方法，及时纠正学习中的教条主义与经验主义；批判应付测验、死背条文、照本宣读等方法。只有这样，才能使政治教育易收实效。
  （二）坚持与加强教育准备会，具体解决连指导员讲课的困难。
    目前连指导员一般的政治理论水平较低，缺乏教学经验，只有加强营团两级的教育准备会，才能弥补这一不足。在教育准备会上，必须根据课本内容，研究教学重点和教学方法以及在实施教学中应注意的诸问题。第一期练兵中的经验证明：凡是这一制度坚持较好的单位，连指导员讲课中的困难就较少，收效也较大。
  （三）加强教课前的具体准备工作。
    教育准备会之后，每个教员在教课前必须根据课文精神，联系本单位的具体情况，进一步作具体准备。个人准备的内容，应掌握以下几个中心：一、阅读课文，熟悉内容，领会并掌握课文的精神。二、根据课文精神，联系本单位的思想情况和认识水平，拟出教课提纲。三、根据教学目的和教课提纲，研究并确定讲课的方式。如何讲？如何引导大家联系实际？怎样引起大家听课的兴趣？这些，都要根据准备的提纲在实施教学时灵活运用。
  （四）实施教育中几种有效的方法。
    甲、对比教育：列举具体事物的对比，启发战士，使其从亲身体验中认识事物的真伪，提高其认识，提高其阶级觉悟。如通过解放区与蒋占区的对比、人民政府与伪“政府”的对比、解放军与蒋匪军的对比，以及敌我的兵役制度、官兵关系、军民关系的对比等，对战士均有重大教育意义。这一经验，在诉苦教育中、第一期练兵教育中以及政协文件学习中，都证明了是成功的。
    乙、举行战士讲演会：讲演会的方法，是用战士的认识来教育战士。因为战士讲话的内容与语言最接近战士，战士们听着最亲切，易收效果。同时，可以促使大家联系自己思想认识，锻炼思考能力与讲演的能力。但讲演会必须有目的、有准备、有组织、有领导地进行，才能收到好的效果。在讲演会之前，必须确定中心：要求贯彻一个什么思想？要求解决那个问题？并通知大家作准备。待酝酿准备成熟后，再行召开。开会时要有领导干部参加，从中发现问题，解决问题。讲演的秩序应事先排定。讲演中或讲完后，应有专人负责，根据讲演的中心内容，领导大家呼口号。讲演会如有适当准备，会中组织严密，会议便紧张、活泼、生动。有的部队在进行政协学习中，采取了这个方法，收效很大。战士们反映：“像这样的会多开点，大家不拘束，有什么说什么，也都有锻炼的机会！”
    丙、以表扬为主，树立好典型。经验证明：多表扬的方法比过去所采用的“大暴露”的方法为好。在进行某一个问题的学习中，根据教学目的和要求，从连队中经过群众性的比评，选拔出典型，作为大家努力的“旗帜”，这样就大大地树立了连队的正气，打击了邪气，启发了大家的向上心，实现了教育的目的。例如我们在进行正规化教育中，就是采取了这一方法：根据正规化的标准，首先作报告，然后发动自下而上的“比评”（这一“比评”，应掌握以树立典型，发扬好的为主），产生出全班的典型；然后经过排的典型比评，产生出排的典型；再以此产生全连的典型。连典型人数可不加限制，视实际情况而定。这样的典型产生之后，大家就找到了学习的榜样。
  （五）掌握讨论会的几个具体问题：
    首先，教员与学习小组长开好准备会，明确讨论的目的，拟定能够引起争论、启发自由思想的讨论题；并进一步研究如何启发诱导的具体方法。其次，在讨论中，小组长要善于掌握会场。小组长在启发大家发言时，特别是当上级干部到会场时，往往容易产生一种急躁的情绪，逼着大家发言，形成“轮班式”。相反的，则是放任不管，任其自流，这两种偏向都直接影响讨论会的效果，应注意避免。第三，小组长要善于发现问题，抓住问题争论的焦点，提出来让大家展开争论，使不完全或错误的见解能得出较完全、正确的结论。第四，讨论后必须作出结论。根据大家的讨论，指示分歧所在，批判错误的认识，归纳大家的意见，把大家的意见更加系统化，提高到原则的水平。
