　　Northeast People's Government Decides to Establish Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle Schools
    Four Schools to Be Established This Year, Enrolling 2,400 Students
    [Our Dispatch] The Northeast Daily published on the 14th "The Decision of the Northeast People's Government on Establishing Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle Schools." The decision stated: "In order to cultivate new-type intellectual cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds in a planned and systematic manner, and in accordance with the spirit of the National Education Conference, it is hereby decided to establish worker-peasant rapid middle schools in the Northeast region to admit worker-peasant cadres for cultural and scientific education, so that they can obtain a secondary education level and basic scientific knowledge, in order to enter university for further study and become the backbone of New China's construction." The decision stipulates: In 1950, the Education Department of the Northeast People's Government, Shenyang City, Harbin City, and Dalian City will each establish one worker-peasant rapid middle school, enrolling a total of 2,400 new students. The first half of the year will be a trial period, with each school enrolling no more than 120 students, in order to gain experience and lay the foundation for increasing student enrollment in the second half of the year and establishing a foundation for large-scale establishment in the future. Students of worker-peasant rapid middle schools should be systematically transferred and selected from various military units, government organs, factories, rural areas and schools. The conditions are: having participated in revolutionary struggle for more than three years, having a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior primary school graduate, being between the ages of sixteen and thirty, being ideologically progressive, physically healthy, and an active original supply-system worker-peasant cadre (both male and female accepted). The length of study at worker-peasant rapid middle schools is tentatively set at three years, which may be extended to four years if necessary. The basic requirement of the curriculum is to enable young worker-peasant cadres to obtain a secondary cultural level and basic scientific knowledge. The curriculum should be streamlined as much as possible, focusing on learning several major subjects well. The most important subjects to study are Chinese language and mathematics (arithmetic, algebra, plane and solid geometry, trigonometry). Secondly, basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, history, geography, and politics, as well as general knowledge of nature (including animals, plants, minerals, and meteorology, etc.) and physiology and hygiene. Physical education, music, art or drawing will be offered as supplementary subjects. Russian, if conditions permit, can be listed as an elective. Textbooks for worker-peasant rapid middle schools will be those uniformly edited by the Central Ministry of Education; before these textbooks are available, self-compiled textbooks can be used in accordance with the curriculum standards and outlines formulated by the Central People's Government Ministry of Education. The faculty of worker-peasant rapid middle schools will be partially supplied by the middle school faculty department of the Northeast Experimental School, and partially transferred from middle schools in various places. Various places should select the most outstanding teachers of various subjects from middle schools to serve as the backbone of teachers in worker-peasant middle schools.
    In order to solve the need for teachers in the worker-peasant rapid middle schools that will be gradually and universally established in various parts of Northeast China in the second half of 1950, the Northeast People's Government has decided that Northeast Normal University will set up a short-term training class for teachers of worker-peasant rapid middle schools this spring, training 150 teachers of various subjects, who will graduate in August and be assigned work uniformly by the Northeast People's Government Ministry of Education.
    In addition, the decision pointed out: Military units in the Northeast region have better conditions and foundations for running worker-peasant rapid middle schools, which can be assisted by local authorities to conduct key trials, gain experience, and establish them on a large scale in the shortest possible time. Provinces that have the conditions to establish worker-peasant rapid middle schools may establish them. The existing spare-time schools or half-day schools of various government organs, factories, and military units should strive to be run well, so that they are connected and coordinated with regular schools, and then selectively improved and strengthened, and gradually run as specialized worker-peasant rapid middle schools.
