Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, New York, 7th: Unemployment in the United States continues to surge. According to the Department of Commerce, the total number of unemployed in February increased by 240,000 compared to January. According to the same statistics, the total number of unemployed has increased by 3,042,000 compared to October 1948, when signs of a crisis began to appear in the US economy.

Even the most conservative observers admit that the official federal figures greatly underestimate the actual number of unemployed. These deliberately underestimated figures do not include millions of workers who work part-time.

In recent months, the number of workers working less than thirty-five hours a week has exceeded eight million. It is estimated that the total number of unemployed and underemployed in the United States actually far exceeds fifteen million.

　　美失业与半失业人数实际超过一千五百万
    二月份较一月增加二十四万
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社纽约七日讯：美国国内失业继续激增。据商务部说，二月份失业总人数较一月份增加了二十四万。根据同一个统计材料，与一九四八年十月危机增长的迹象开始在美国经济中出现时相较，失业总人数增加了三百零四万二千。
    就连最保守的观察家们亦承认：联邦官方数字大大地低估了实际的失业人数。这些故意低估的数字，不包括数百万做部分时间工作的工人。
    在最近数月中，每周工作时间不到三十五小时的工人的数目超过八百万。据估计：美国失业和半失业的总人数，实际上大大超过一千五百万。
