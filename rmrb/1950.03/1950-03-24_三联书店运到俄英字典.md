　　Sanlian Bookstore Ships Russian-English Dictionaries
　　[Our Newspaper] The Sanlian Bookstore of Life, Reading, and New Knowledge in this city previously shipped a batch of Russian-English dictionaries. At that time, because the quantity was small, they were snapped up by readers in one or two days. In order to meet the needs of the vast number of readers who are learning Russian, and accepting suggestions from all parties, the bookstore has now shipped a large number of Moscow edition "Russian-English Dictionaries" for general supply.

　　三联书店运到俄英字典
    【本报讯】本市生活、读书、新知三联书店，过去曾一度运到一批俄英字典，当时因数量不多，在一、二天内即被读者抢购一空。该店为照顾广大读者学习俄文的需要，并接受各方面的建议，现特大量运到莫斯科版的《俄英字典》，普遍供应。
