    The Banner of Peace Flies Over London
    British People Hold Grand Rally
    Welcome World Peace Congress Delegates
    Urge Parliament to Accept Peace Proposals

    Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th. The British people warmly welcomed the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, urging the British Parliament to accept the Standing Committee's peace proposals, and condemning British Prime Minister Attlee and others for refusing to meet with the delegation. According to a TASS dispatch from London: When members of the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace called for strengthening the struggle for peace in Britain at a rally in London on March 14, they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers.

    Representatives from France, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands in the WPC delegation spoke at the meeting, describing the development of the peace movement in their respective countries and the increasing resistance of workers in various countries to governments that are implementing US imperialist policies.

    When the chairman of the British Peace Committee, scientist Crowther, said that British Prime Minister Attlee had refused to meet with the delegation, and that Churchill had not even responded to their request, the audience shouted loudly, "Shame!" When he told the audience that Soviet representatives Simonov, Kabalevsky, and Hungarian representative Archbishop Janos had not been able to arrive in Britain because the British government had refused to issue them entry visas, another huge shout of "Shame!" rang out.

    The participants unanimously passed a resolution expressing full support for the proposals of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and calling on the British Parliament to accept them.

    On the afternoon of the 14th, hundreds of London citizens first went to the House of Commons to urge members of Parliament to support the peace proposals put forward by the WPC. Then housewives from all districts of London came to Westminster (the seat of the British Parliament). However, the British police only allowed a few people to enter Parliament at a limited time, so those waiting outside formed many long queues. Many people wore the emblem of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace – the "Dove of Peace" – on their coats. Later, workers came directly from various factories or other workplaces to join the ranks of the housewives.

    Many members of Parliament, including Labour members, refused to meet with those who requested to speak with them. Housewives from Churchill's constituency waited in the Parliament lounge for Churchill for more than an hour and a half, but he ignored their request and refused to meet them. One of the housewives told reporters: "When Churchill is our MP, proposing peace is like hitting a brick wall!"

    On the same afternoon, Soviet women living in Britain also visited Parliament. When they came out of the Parliament building, they were greeted with cheers: "Long live Soviet peace!"

    Members of the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace were also greeted with cheers when they left the Parliament building. According to the secretary of the delegation, they were received by Liberal Party leader Davies, while Attlee and Churchill consistently refused to meet with them. The delegation left a letter with Davies outlining the peace proposals of the WPC delegation, and also left similar letters for Attlee and Churchill.

    According to London newspapers, police on duty in the House of Commons discovered two large flags flying on the roof. One flag read: "Ban the atomic bomb!" The other flag read: "Peace!"

　　和平大旗飘扬在伦敦
    英国人民举行盛大集会
    欢迎和大代表
    敦促议会接受和平建议
    【新华社十六日讯】英国人民热烈欢迎世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的代表团，敦促英国议会接受常委会的和平建议，并斥责英国首相艾德礼等拒见代表团。据塔斯社伦敦消息：当世界拥护和平大会常设委员会代表团的团员们，在三月十四日的伦敦集会上，号召加强在英国争取和平的斗争时，他们受到了热烈的欢呼。
    和大代表团中法国、丹麦、意大利和荷兰的代表先后在会上发表演说，描述他们国内和平运动的发展以及各国工人对于那些正在执行美帝国主义政策的政府不断增强其抵抗的情形。
    当英国和平委员会主席科学家克劳瑟说到英国首相艾德礼已拒绝与代表团会晤、而邱吉尔甚至对于他们的请求不予回复时，听众大声地喊叫：“可耻！”当他告诉听众苏联代表西蒙诺夫、卡巴列夫斯基和匈牙利代表雅诺斯大主教由于英国政府拒发入境签证而未能到达英国时，又响起一阵巨大的喊声：“可耻！”
    与会者一致通过决议，表示充分支持世界和平大会常设委员会的建议，并呼吁英国议会予以接受。
    十四日下午，数百名伦敦市民首先前往下院，敦促议员们支持和大所提出的和平建议。接着伦敦全市各区的主妇们，也纷纷来到了威斯特敏斯特（英国议会所在地）。但英国警察只许可少数人在限定的时间进入议会，因此，在外面等待的人们就排成了许多长长的行列。许多人在外衣上挂着世界拥护和平大会的标帜——“和平之鸽”。后来又有工人直接自各工厂或其它工作地点赶来，参加主妇们的队伍。
    许多议员们，包括工党议员在内，都拒绝会见要求与他们谈话的人。自邱吉尔的选区前来的主妇们，在议会休息室等待邱吉尔达一个半小时以上，但他漠视她们的请求，不予接见。主妇中的一个对记者说：“当邱吉尔当我们的议员，我们提和平简直是碰了砖墙！”
    当日下午，住在英国的苏联妇女，也来访问议会。当她们从议会大楼出来时，受到了欢呼：“对苏联和平万岁！”
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会代表团团员离开议会大楼时，也受到了欢呼。据该代表团的书记说，他们受到了自由党领袖戴维斯的接见，而艾德礼和邱吉尔却始终拒绝会见他们。代表团留给戴维斯一封信，信中提出了和大代表团的和平建议，也给艾德礼、邱吉尔二人留下了类似的信。
    据伦敦报载，在下院值勤的警察，发现了两面大旗，飘扬在楼顶。一面旗上写着：“禁止原子弹！”另一面旗上写着：“和平！”
