　　On Newspaper Commentary
    ——Lecture at the Central High Party School of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
    Ge Lieb Nie Fu
    The Party organization has enormous and multifaceted activities in leading economic, political, and cultural life, and in implementing communist education for the working people. Among these activities, news publishing, especially newspapers, is of particular importance. Well-organized newspapers enable Party committees at all levels to more effectively realize political leadership over the economy, promote criticism and self-criticism, and expand connections with the masses. If newspapers are well-organized, they can play a very significant role in improving the overall organizational and political work of the Party and in cultivating young Party cadres. Newspapers are the most important tool for enhancing all of the Party's ideological work and are the fighting organs for implementing political education among the masses. Therefore, strengthening and improving local newspapers and fully utilizing their organizational and mobilizing forces have now become the most important tasks of Party committees at all levels.
    Whether the work of local newspapers can be improved depends first on the extent to which Party organs can strengthen their leadership over the newspapers and the degree to which they can correctly resolve all the most important issues related to the work of the newspapers.
            I. Newspaper Commentary is One of the Most Important Ways for the Party to Lead Newspapers
    One of the most effective forms of Party leadership over newspapers is the newspaper commentary published in the central, republic, border region, and provincial newspapers. This form has long proven its effectiveness and has firmly entered our journalistic practice.
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Stalin personally have repeatedly pointed out the importance of newspaper commentary as a tool for leading newspapers.
    The "Resolution on Village, District, and Mass Newspapers" of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee, passed in January 1931, in its section on fundamentally improving the ideological and organizational leadership of newspapers by the Central Committees, provincial committees, and border region committees of the Communist Parties of the various republics, put forward a task:
    "…To do a good job of systematic district newspaper commentary and mass newspaper commentary in the newspapers of the various republics, border regions, and provinces, so that these commentaries are on par with editorials in terms of significance." (Decisions of the Party on the Press, p. 134, National Publishing Bureau, 1941.)
    On April 16 of the same year, the "Resolution on the Reorganization of the Worker-Peasant Correspondent Movement" was passed. In this resolution, we can read the following passage:
    "The Central Committee charges the central, provincial, and district newspapers with systematically publishing commentaries on factory, state farm, and collective farm wall newspapers and printed newspapers, criticizing their errors and pointing out their merits, and publishing the most valuable materials in their own pages." (Ibid., p. 138.)
    In the "Resolution on Improving the Strategy of Three Newspapers, The Hammer, The Volga Commune, and The Kursk Truth," passed by the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee in July 1946, the editors of these newspapers were advised:
    "…To systematically publish commentaries on city and district newspapers, and to help them with practical opinions and concrete instructions." (Culture and Life, 1946, Issue 4.)
    In August 1946, the Party Central Committee passed a resolution on the work of "Pravda". This resolution pointed out that "Pravda" should strengthen its leading role over other newspapers. The editorial department should resume publishing commentaries on the newspapers of the various republics, provinces, and districts.
    "Commentaries," the resolution said, "should give a comprehensive criticism of the shortcomings of the newspapers, guide the newspapers to deeply report on the life of the various republics, border regions, and provinces, and assist the editorial departments of the various local newspapers to become fighting organs for implementing political education among the masses."
    Thus, several resolutions of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee very clearly point out the great significance of newspaper commentary as a tool for ideologically and organizationally leading newspapers and as a way of providing daily assistance to journalistic cadres. The tasks of newspaper commentary can be briefly summarized as follows:
    First, critically comment on and comprehensively analyze the content of the newspapers. Through commentary, check how this or that newspaper fulfills its tasks under the specific conditions of the provinces and border regions, and how they assist the Party organizations in implementing the most important economic and political measures.
    Second, help newspapers with practical opinions and instructions. The commentary should be beneficial not only to those newspapers that are being reviewed but also to many newspapers. The commentary should point out the direction of the work of the editorial departments of the newspapers.
    Third, report on the most meaningful and important materials published in local newspapers. Republic, border region, and provincial newspapers must seize on the important and difficult issues raised in district, city, and factory newspapers.
    Fourth, support and expand the initiatives and positive experiences in the work of the newspapers, and launch creative competitions among the editorial departments.
    So what exactly is newspaper commentary as a journalistic form?
    The resolution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee requires that the commentary be on par with editorials in terms of significance. This indicates that newspaper commentary is primarily a leading article, similar in nature to an editorial.
    But this does not mean that in its form and design, the commentary should be completely similar to an editorial. No! In significance, it is a leading manuscript from the editorial department, but in form, newspaper commentary is roughly more similar to a book review. Moreover, newspaper commentary is divided into several types and several forms. We can list some of the most popular ones.
    Thematic commentary. This type of commentary specifies any topic, for example, using the newspaper to explain individual economic issues, Party life issues, cultural issues, etc. The commentary selects a topic based on the specific materials of the newspaper for comment. Thematic commentary may also comment on a single essay.
    The second type or form of commentary is general commentary. This commentary targets the entire newspaper, analyzing the work of a newspaper during a certain period, reviewing the content of the materials it publishes, and its line on major and fundamental issues.
    Reporting commentary. This type of commentary discusses the content of the most valuable materials published in one or several newspapers.
    In addition, there is a so-called mini-commentary. For example: "Newspaper Review", "Recent Mail", "Newspaper Initiatives", etc. This type of short and concise commentary has very significant meaning.
    From December 1, 1947, "Pravda", following the instructions of the secretary of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee, added a column: "Newspaper Review." The task facing the editorial department was to regularly publish abstracts of "Newspaper Review" in "Pravda" in addition to newspaper commentary. These "abstracts" reported on the most meaningful materials published in the newspapers, reprinted their main content, supported the initiatives and good initiatives in the work of the editorial departments, seized on and summarized the particularly important issues raised by the newspapers, and brought them to the forum of the entire Soviet Union. The "Newspaper Review" abstracts were all-encompassing, including all forms of short newspaper commentary: thematic commentary, reporting commentary, commentary on a particular issue of the newspaper, individual materials, critical commentary, and praising commentary.
    After the appearance of the "Newspaper Review" column, it immediately received a wide welcome among newspaper workers and readers of "Pravda". In five months (December 1947 to April 1948), this column appeared 38 times in "Pravda". A total of 138 short commentaries and messages were published.
    Now it is possible to synthesize some of the experience accumulated by "Pravda" and draw conclusions: what should be the direction of mini-newspaper commentary work? These conclusions also apply to the newspapers of the republics, border regions, and provinces.
    According to the content of the materials published in the "Newspaper Review" column, these commentaries can be divided into several categories. Which categories are they?
    (1) The first category of commentaries is where "Pravda" borrows to support the most important issues raised by local newspapers.
    A few commentaries can be cited as examples, with the following themes: on the surplus and unnecessary materials stored in the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (excerpted from the city newspaper "Magnitogorsk Worker"); on reclaiming new land (excerpted from the Yaroslavl newspaper "Northern Worker"); on the work of the technical information department in the factory ("Stalingrad Truth"); on drought-prevention forests ("Altai Truth"); on the electrification of collective farm production ("Ural Worker"); on establishing its own fuel base in Tomsk ("Red Flag"); on the consumer goods workshops in enterprises ("Tambov Truth").
    It should be pointed out that the opinions of the local newspapers supported by "Pravda" have all aroused a wide social response, and both local and central organs have taken various measures as a result of these opinions. Due to the news about the storage of unnecessary materials in the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, several government organs issued instructions to their respective enterprises, ordering them to check warehouses and use those surplus materials. After seeing the communication entitled "Newspaper Does Not Reach Villages and Towns" published in the Kamensky District newspaper in the Penza Province, the Soviet Ministry of Transport took many measures. On January 30, 1948, a message entitled "What is the Technical Information Department Doing?" was published in the "Newspaper Review" column. The message reported that "Stalingrad Truth" criticized the poor performance of the Technical Department of the Tractor Manufacturing Plant. Not only the Automotive and Tractor Industry Department, but even other departments, made considerable conclusions based on this report.
    The border region and provincial newspapers, like "Pravda", must seize on the most valuable and sharp opinions of the district, city, and factory newspapers.
    In order to achieve these goals, if there are individual essays and communications in the newspapers that raise significant issues of great importance to the republic, province, or border region, they must be reprinted. This can also indicate the interaction of the many institutional newspapers published in our country.
    (2) Reporting commentaries and messages published in the "Newspaper Review" column of "Pravda". "Pravda" reported on interesting facts and news in local life based on the materials of the newspapers. For example, the following can be included in this category: on the congress of young female activists ("Kabardin Truth"); on the first million above-plan profits ("Volga Commune"); on the work of the Labor Protection Research Institute ("Leningrad Evening News"); on the scientific day of the collective farm (Odessa's "Banner of the Bolshevik"); on Siberian carpets ("Red Mound").
    Republic, border region, and provincial newspapers should widely use district and city newspapers to report on the lives of districts, cities, industries, collective farms, and state farms.
    (3) Commentaries and messages supporting initiatives and valuable proposals in the work of the editorial departments of local newspapers. The following examples are messages of this type: rural correspondent posts in irrigation construction areas (Sverdlovsk Truth, district newspaper of Oryol Province); symposium of mine accountants held in the editorial department (La Zhai Ang Si Ka Don Nie Qing Na Bao, Stalino City); agricultural issue exchange column of the newspapers of Semipalatinsk Province and Pavlodar Province; propaganda of the experience of agricultural progressives in the newspapers (Kursk Truth, Volga Commune); lectures by Stakhanov workers and engineers and innovators in the newspapers (Zaporozhye Bolshevik).
    At the same time, republic, border region, and provincial newspapers must fully support and disseminate the initiatives and experiences in the work of the district, city, and factory newspapers, and launch active creative competitions among the editorial departments of the newspapers.
    (4) Short commentaries criticizing the shortcomings in the work of the newspapers and the errors in this or that material. For example, on January 5, 1948, "Pravda" published a message entitled "Necessary Explanation" in the "Newspaper Review" column. The message said: The newspaper of the Novo-Buyansky District made incorrect guidance on the basic-level Party organizations in recruiting new members in a special column. According to "Pravda" news, later, as a result, the Kuibyshev Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted a considerable decision. On May 20, a short critical commentary on two materials published in the "Udmurt Truth" was published because the newspaper did not conduct a thorough struggle to expand the production of daily consumer goods.
    Therefore, we can see how diverse and interesting the forms of newspaper commentary are, and at the same time, what a great significance they have for improving and enhancing all the work of the newspapers.
    Without criticism, without beneficial analysis, without the study and summary of newspaper work experience, newspapers cannot develop and improve smoothly. Therefore, all forms of newspaper commentary should occupy a considerable place in the newspapers of the republics, border regions, and provinces.
            II. Requirements to be Observed in Newspaper Commentary
    What necessary requirements should the author of newspaper commentary, that is, the editor of the newspaper, observe?
    The first requirement is that newspaper commentary should not nitpick over the accidental errors of the newspaper, but should analyze the content and work of the newspaper from the essence and fundamental principles. It should be pointed out that some observers often criticize small details and nitpick at miswritten words and typos, thus turning the shortcomings of our newspapers into objects of ridicule and satire.
    Here are a few examples of this type of commentary.
    Once, the newspaper "Bolshevik Road" in Bizhansk District, Kirov Province, printed the issue number incorrectly. The provincial newspaper "Kirov Truth" thought it should publish a message of "Recent Mail" for this matter. The title of this message was "The Oldest District Newspaper". The message wrote:
    "When was the inaugural issue of the newspaper 'Bolshevik Road' in Bizhansk District published? According to the data of the editorial department (see the issue number next to the masthead), from the inaugural issue to February 7, 1946, 17,115 issues have been published. As long as you calculate the time the newspaper is published regularly, it is not difficult to determine that the inaugural issue of 'Bolshevik Road' was published during the most intense period of the Crimean War (1854-1856). Therefore, congratulations should be given to this newspaper in Bizhansk!"
    Another newspaper in the province, "Stalin Road" (the newspaper of Dujinsk District), printed the date of publication incorrectly. The provincial newspaper published a "Recent Mail" specifically for this matter, with a rather malicious title, "Dreams Come True?". The author of the article, based on only one fact, meticulously accused the editor of the district newspaper, accusing him of being lazy, accusing him of dozing at the editing table, etc.
    The newspaper in the Liebknecht District of the Stavropol Border Region published several advertisements with ungrammatical sentences. "Stavropol Truth" decided to speak specifically about this matter. The editorial department of the border region newspaper should tell the editors of the district newspapers that after they sign, they are also responsible for checking the manuscripts published in the newspaper, because they are also responsible for the content of the advertisements. However, the commentary writer of "Stavropol Truth" did not take such a serious attitude, but decided to satirize the editor of the district newspaper. The message of "Recent Mail" ended like this: "Under this circumstance, the newspaper may also appear advertisements with such content: 'An irresponsible editor came to the editorial department, the manuscript has been read by everyone before the printing, but only a few people do not read it, and that is the person who signs for publication.'"
    Taking such an attitude towards newspaper commentary is of little benefit to the editorial department of the newspaper, and it is difficult to make them learn anything. On the contrary, incorrect and aggressive arguments will only arouse the anger of the workers in the district newspaper, and will discredit the reputation of the newspaper in the eyes of the readers. If we only extract tiny mistakes and inappropriate words from the newspapers to replace true Bolshevik criticism, it will not be of much benefit. What we need is sensitive and principled criticism that must expose the real shortcomings of the newspapers, educate newspaper workers, and suggest ways to improve newspaper work.
    Here, we should mention what Comrade Stalin said at the meeting of the Organization Bureau of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee on January 26, 1925, for the matter of "Demoska Newspaper". At that time, Comrade Stalin pointed out when talking about our writers and correspondents: "...we should listen to the voices of these comrades, instead of satirizing the staff of our newspapers."
    Our commentary writers must criticize this or that newspaper from a principled, Party standpoint, and must criticize the newspaper's line on the most important issues, instead of just "nitpicking". Of course, we must severely criticize the mistakes and shortcomings in the work of the newspapers, especially ungrammatical sentences and sloppy writing. However, we must criticize seriously, and we must convince people, so that the editor can draw conclusions from the criticism.
    The second requirement should also be strictly observed, that is, to maintain an objective attitude when criticizing newspaper work.
    Sometimes, there are facts that the commentary writers of the provincial and border region newspapers have an insincere attitude towards the editors of the commentaries. Such a commentary writer does not seriously study the content of the newspaper, reviews the newspaper's line on this or that issue in a certain period, and as soon as the materials are in hand, he immediately begins to make various conclusions and inferences. After the inspection, these conclusions are groundless, the reasons are insufficient, and there are biases and distortions in the commentary.
    Objectivity - the most important requirement for any material published in the newspaper, and it is also what the author of the newspaper commentary should observe.
    The third requirement, it is very important to point out the typical shortcomings of our newspapers in the commentary, and to raise the fundamental issues of our newspaper work in the commentary. The commentary should be educational not only for the newspaper that publishes the materials being reviewed, but also for many newspapers.
    At the same time, it should be pointed out that the central, republic, border region, and provincial newspapers must publish commentaries on urgent topics of the current reality in a timely manner and guide the newspapers with appropriate methods.
    The fourth requirement is that the commentary writer must consider the actual conditions of the newspaper he is reviewing: its layout and format, the regularity of publication, etc. At the same time, when reviewing the newspaper's reports on this or that field of work, this or that movement, etc., it should not be based on the quantity of materials, but on the quality of the materials, and must be based on the ideological and political level.
    The fifth requirement comes out of the general Party significance of the commentary. In criticizing the newspaper, the observer should often raise the issue of the Party's leadership of the newspaper and the cooperation of Party organizations and Communist Party members in the newspaper. Party committees and Party organizations should understand that if the newspaper is criticized, it means that their work is being criticized, so they should use the entire strength of the Party organization to eliminate the shortcomings and make their own newspaper a model newspaper.
    These are the basic requirements for the editorial department of the newspaper to handle newspaper commentary.
            III. Newspaper Commentary in Republic and Provincial Newspapers
    Recently, the newspapers of various republics, border regions, and provinces have improved their work in the district and factory newspapers, and have begun to publish newspaper commentary frequently. Many newspaper editorial departments have added a "Review of District Newspapers" section.
    After studying the commentary, it can be seen that good and mature opinions on the issue of the work of district newspapers have begun to be published in the newspapers of many border regions and provinces. However, some relatively poor and unskilled commentaries have also appeared.
    Let's briefly review some characteristic shortcomings of newspaper commentary. In this regard, we can review newspaper commentary according to the following three topics: reports on rural economic issues in the district newspapers, reports on issues of Party life, and the status of district newspapers performing propaganda duties.
    Rural economic issues in district newspapers. The basic shortcoming of some commentaries of this type is that the commentary writers do not take into account the characteristics that should be had when reporting on collective farm production issues in the district newspapers. Because we know that the district newspapers reporting any rural economic movement must be different from the provincial and local newspapers.
    Take the spring plowing as an example. The provincial newspaper, with thirty to fifty districts in its view, should of course pay attention to how the sowing work is carried out in the entire province, in various districts, and in individual tractor stations, collective farms, and work teams. But it cannot systematically report to the readers how the sowing work is carried out in each collective farm and each tractor team. The situation of the district newspaper is completely different. It only serves one district, and in its view, there are only two or three tractor stations and dozens of collective farms. For the district newspaper, it can be required to pay daily attention to how the sowing work is organized and carried out directly in each collective farm and each work team. The district newspaper is close to the collective farmers and the tractor drivers. The pages of the district newspaper should face them first, should talk to them, and should first educate them with a communist attitude of labor. This situation determines the face of the district newspaper as the most mass-oriented newspaper. This also largely determines the appropriate forms and methods of the work of the district newspaper.
    The characteristics and nature of the district newspaper are very clearly stipulated in the decision of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee on July 13, 1940. Let’s see how this decision explains:
    "The district newspaper must have a clearly expressed face, reflecting the production characteristics and economy of the district. This newspaper should be largely filled with articles and communications on local topics, and should widely attract Party, Soviet, and group leaders and experts in the district to speak on the newspaper."
    It should be stated that far from all district newspapers have a clearly expressed production face, and unfortunately, the provincial newspapers rarely educate the staff of the district newspapers on how to make the district newspaper a fighting newspaper of the masses.
    The second shortcoming of many commentaries on economic topics is that these commentaries often do not educate the editorial departments of the newspapers on the political position to be taken when reporting on practical economic issues.
    The newspaper is a political organ. In the struggle to implement the economic plan, in the reports of the work of the Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, it must show a high degree of Bolshevik ideology, principle, and sensitivity. Politics and business are inseparable. If the newspaper publishes news about spring plowing, autumn harvest, and grain delivery, then it must learn to report on the specific tasks of the collective farms from a political standpoint during these movements, and link the tasks of the district with the tasks of the country. The newspaper must evaluate the practical business work of the leaders of the collective farms, tractor stations, and state farms not from an official standpoint, but from a political, Party standpoint.
    The editorial departments of the republic newspapers and provincial newspapers should call for opposition to the disregard of politics in the reports of business issues in the newspaper commentary, and should show the staff of the district newspapers in specific materials what is meant by taking a political, Party standpoint on phenomena and practical business life.
    The third shortcoming of the provincial newspapers' work on reviewing economic topics is the narrowness of the topics. The provincial newspapers often only show the activities of the district newspapers in reporting on rural economic movements. This is of course correct. But it should also be noted how the newspapers engage in all aspects of collective farm production. Here, we should pay attention to the struggle to strictly observe the regulations of rural economic organizations, the issue of developing animal husbandry, electrification, village facilities, construction, and other things.
    Issues of Party life in the district newspapers. Recently, the republic newspapers and provincial newspapers have often begun to publish commentaries on the materials on Party topics published by the district newspapers and city newspapers.
    Many good and interesting commentaries have appeared, in which the issue of how the district newspapers and city newspapers handle the Party life column is correctly reported.
    However, after studying the newspaper commentary on Party topics, it is found that these commentaries often have important shortcomings.
    Like the commentaries on economic reports, the editorial departments of the provincial newspapers do not always take into account the characteristics of the district newspapers reporting on Party work issues, nor do they specifically state what work the district newspapers should engage in first. We are fully aware that the focus of attention of the district newspapers should be the life of basic-level Party organizations. The newspaper must widely and comprehensively report on the activities of Party organizations, summarize the experience of their organized and mass political work, explain how Communist Party members play a vanguard role in collective farm production, how they conduct mass propaganda and mobilization, and how they improve their ideological and political level.
    Provincial newspapers, border region newspapers, and republic newspapers should teach the editorial departments of district newspapers to correctly report on the issues of Party construction, and give them hints on more important and more urgent topics. Of course, it is not difficult to understand that the editorial departments of the provincial, border region, and republic newspapers should be very familiar with the issues of Party work. On this point, it should be pointed out that on the contrary, this aspect is encountered in some newspaper commentaries. For example, in the "Turkmen Spark Newspaper", at the end of March 1948, a commentary of "Bolshevik" newspaper was published, entitled "Should Party Life Be Reported Like This". In this commentary, some important issues are raised, the first part of which is not doubtful. But at the end of the commentary, this republic newspaper actually raised such opinions to the provincial newspapers and district newspapers: "The task of the newspapers that report on Party life must start from here: to be good at expressing and strictly distinguishing Party work, mass political work, and the Party's supervision of business work on their own pages". This confusing formula will confuse the staff of the provincial newspapers and district newspapers. What does it mean to distinguish Party work, mass political work, and Party supervision? Is it not clear that the strength of the Party organization lies precisely in unifying all forms of Party political and organizational work, and the success of the Party's leadership of business and supervision of business relies on being good at linking Party work and mass work and other things.
    Staff who are familiar with Party construction issues and can provide the district newspaper with insightful work on how to handle the Party life column should be charged with writing newspaper commentary on Party topics.
    District newspapers perform propaganda duties. The decision of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee on July 13, 1940, "On District Newspapers" said:
    "The basic task of the district newspaper is to conduct ideological and political education of the workers on the basis of daily propaganda of the current policies and measures of the Party and the government, and this propaganda must be based on concrete, close, and easily understandable facts in local practice and in the life of the district, collective farms, and enterprises."
    This clearly stipulates the basic task of the district newspaper. The central, republic, and provincial newspapers must explain how the district newspaper fulfills its main responsibility, and help them truly become the organ of political education of the workers.
    Unfortunately, this basic task of the district newspaper is still outside the view of many of our newspapers. In the republic and provincial newspapers, there are very few commentaries on the performance of the propaganda duties of the district newspapers and on the realization of their educational tasks. Because, although some of our district newspapers can solve this task very well, on the contrary, there are many newspapers that are obviously not competent for this task.
    True, the propaganda role of the district newspaper is sometimes discussed in the commentaries on other topics, but only incidentally, not as the main topic. However, this is the most important issue of newspaper work now.
    In order to accelerate the advance on the road to communism, and to more fully utilize all our political, economic, cultural, and organizational possibilities, the work of communist education of the people should be strengthened in many ways. Therefore, it is not accidental that the Party places ideological education issues and the development of the socialist consciousness of the Soviet people in the first place. This task must be the focus of attention of the Party organizations, and the focus of attention of our newspapers, because our newspapers are a powerful tool for mass political enlightenment and education.
    The staff of the district newspapers should be explained in detail and clearly how the district newspapers should realize their propaganda and educational duties, through what roads, and with what methods and forms. It should be explained that not only specialized propaganda articles, but also all kinds of different newspaper materials - from communications to scientific essays, from sketches and novels to news reports - must serve one purpose: to educate the Soviet people with a communist spirit, with a patriotic spirit, and with the pride of the Soviet nation.
    If we look at the practice of our newspaper work from this point of view, then we can see that the educational significance of the so-called current topic materials published is very small. They are too indifferent to politics. The newspapers often do not link the specific tasks of the workers of individual factories, collective farms, and state farms with the general task of the country to implement the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan. This of course does not mean that all newspaper materials should be embedded in appropriate specific sentences. No, the problem is to improve the ideological and political level of the articles, communications, and news published in our newspapers. Comrade Stalin taught that the newspapers should "...illuminate every phenomenon encountered by the workers with the light of scientific socialism." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 1, page 9). The staff of the newspapers should be taught to approach every phenomenon of economic and cultural life from a political standpoint.
    Regarding this point, Kalinin once said:
    "Soviet journalists should look for the connection between every local phenomenon and the general phenomenon, the connection between the local and the overall unity, which is precisely in line with the real development of people's social life. Providing various different materials - from communications about the success of collective farms to deep scientific essays, from news reports to highly artistic works; Soviet and radio staff, in reflecting the various forms of our daily life and all the twists and turns of the human soul in this kind of material, will inevitably and unconsciously show the victory of Lenin and Stalin's thought in practice, and Lenin and Stalin's thought is precisely the manifestation of the objective laws of social development."
    The task is to educate the staff of the district newspapers to be good at realizing the educational and propaganda duties of the newspapers.
    There is no special newspaper commentary column in the editorial departments of the local newspapers and provincial newspapers. Which department should engage in the work of commentary? In practice, it is different. Most newspapers entrust this work to the Party Life Department, and some newspapers engage in commentary work by the Secretariat and the Propaganda Department. We think the former is right: newspaper commentary should be done by the Party Life Department.
    But this does not mean that only the staff of the Party Life Department can be the authors of commentary. All relatively skilled editorial staff should be attracted to do newspaper commentary work. Every journalist should regard writing commentary and helping the staff of the district newspapers as a Party responsibility and his own professional obligation. His own correspondents should also be attracted to do this work. They must be very familiar with the work of the district newspapers, pay attention to the content of the district newspapers, and be able to publish commentary articles.
    In the editorial department of every republic, border region, and provincial newspaper, it is important to organize regular observation and reading of the district newspapers. Regarding this point, an effective method should be introduced: to assign one or several newspapers to certain staff of the editorial department. It should be known that the topic of the commentary often arises after observing the newspapers and reading the mail every day.
    The republic, border region, and provincial newspapers use newspaper commentary to help the Party organs realize the ideological and political leadership of the district newspapers, and the district newspapers are the largest and most numerous team among our newspapers. In order to successfully complete this important and responsible work, the editorial departments of the newspapers should:
    (1) Publish commentaries on the newspapers of cities, districts, and factories in a planned way, and use this to lead their work, and help them with practical opinions and specific instructions.
    (2) In the "Review of City and District Newspapers", report on the more meaningful materials published in the local newspapers, summarize the particularly important issues raised by the newspapers, and support the spontaneity and valuable initiatives in the work of the newspapers.
    (3) Improve the quality and ideological and political level of the newspaper commentary. The focus of the commentary lies in: how the district newspaper fulfills its basic responsibility, and how to do it in order to make every newspaper a fighting organ of mass political education.
                                    (Bing Yi Translated)

　　论报刊述评
    ——在联共（布）中央最高党校讲
    葛烈勃涅夫
    党组织在领导经济生活、政治生活和文化生活方面，在向劳动者实施共产主义教育方面，有着巨大的和多方面的活动，而在这些活动中，意义特别重大的是新闻出版，尤其是报纸。组织健全的报纸使各级党委可能更完善地实现对经济作政治的领导，发挥批评和自我批评，扩大和群众的联系。报纸如果组织得好，它对于整个党的组织工作和党的政治工作的提高，对于党的年轻的工作干部的培养，可能起极大极大的作用。报纸是提高党的全部意识形态工作的最重要的工具，是向群众实施政治教育的战斗机关。所以，加强和改进地方报纸，全面利用地方报纸的组织力量和动员力量，——这现在已成了各级党委最重要的任务。
    地方报纸工作的能否提高，首先要看党机关对报纸的领导能加强到什么地步和它们解决一切和报纸工作有关的最重要的问题能正确到怎样的程度。
            一  报刊述评是党领导报纸的最重要方式之一
    党领导报纸的最有效的形式之一是发表在中央、各共和国、边区和省的报纸上的报刊述评。这种形式早已证实了它的效力而巩固地进入了我们新闻工作的实践。
    党中央委员会和斯大林同志曾亲自一再指出那作为领导报纸的工具的报刊述评的重要性。
    一九三一年一月通过的联共（布）中央《关于村、区和群众报刊》的决议，在它论及根本改进各加盟共和国共产党中央、省委、边区委在思想上和在组织上领导报刊的一部分中，提出了一个任务：
    “……办好各共和国、边区和省的报纸上的有系统的区报述评和群众报刊述评，使这些述评在意义上能和社论并驾齐驱。”（《党关于报刊的决议》，一三四页，国家出版局。一九四一。）
    同年四月十六日，通过了《关于工农通讯员运动的改组》的决议。在这个决议中，我们可以读到下面一段：
    “中央委员会责成各中央、省和区的报纸有系统地刊载工厂、国营农场和集体农场的壁报和铅印报的述评，批评它们的错误和指出它们的功绩，并且把最珍贵的材料刊载在自己的篇幅上。”（同前，一三八页。）
    在一九四六年七月通过的联共（布）中央关于改进《铁锤报》、《伏尔加公社报》和《库尔斯克真理报》三报的方策的决议中向各该报编辑建议：
    “……有系统地发表市和区的报纸的述评，并且以切实的意见和具体的指示来帮助它们。”（《文化和生活》，一九四六年第四期。）
    一九四六年八月，党中央委员会通过了关于《真理报》的工作的决议。在这个决议中指出：《真理报》应该加强它对其他报纸的带头的领导的作用。编辑部应该恢复刊载对于各共和国、省和区的报纸的述评。
    《述评》，这决议中说，“应该对各报的缺点给予全面的批评，指导各报深刻地报道各共和国、边区、省的生活，扶助各地方报纸的编辑部成为向群众实施政治教育的战斗机关。”
    由此可见，联共（布）中央的几个决议非常清楚地指出：作为在思想上和组织上领导报纸的工具和作为日常扶助新闻工作者干部的方式的报刊述评，有着多么重大的意义。报刊述评的任务可以简要地归纳如下：
    第一，批判地评论和全面地分析各报的内容。通过述评来检查：这个或那个报纸在各省、各边区的具体条件之下怎样完成它们所面临的任务，它们怎样协助党组织实现最重要的经济和政治的措施。
    第二，以切实的意见和指示帮助各报。述评不但对于那些被评论的报纸，而且对于许多报纸，都应该是有益的。述评应该指点各报编辑部工作的方向。
    第三，报道地方报纸上发表的最有意义和最重要的资料。共和国、边区、省的报纸必须抓住区、市、工厂的报纸上所提出的重要的疑难问题。
    第四，支持和扩大各报工作中的创议和积极经验，开展各编辑部的创造性的竞赛。
    那末作为新闻形式之一的报刊述评究竟是什么呢？
    联共（布）中央的决议要求述评在它的意义上和社论并驾齐驱。这表明：报刊述评首先是起领导作用的论文，其性质和社论相仿佛。
    但是这并不表示：在它的形式上，在它的设计上，述评应该完完全全类似社论。不！在意义上，这是起领导作用的编辑部的稿件，但是在形式上，报纸述评大致比较近似书报评论。而且报刊述评分成几种类型，几种形式。我们可以举出其中最流行的几种。
    专题述评。这一类述评是规定任何一个题目的，例如，以报纸解释个别的经济问题、党生活问题、文化问题等等为专题。述评根据报纸的具体材料选定一个题目来加以评论。专题述评也可能评论单独的某一篇论文。
    第二种述评的类型或者形式是一般述评。这种述评以整个报纸为对象，分析某一报纸在某一时期内的工作，检讨它所发表的材料的内容，它在主要的基本的问题方面的路线。
    报道性述评。这类述评所论述的是一种或几种报纸所发表的最有价值的材料的内容。
    此外，还有一种所谓小型述评。例如：“报纸巡礼”，“最近来邮”，“报纸的创议”等等。这类形式短小精悍的述评有着非常重大的意义。
    从一九四七年十二月一日起，《真理报》遵照联共（布）中央委员会书记的指示，增辟了一栏：“报纸巡礼”。编辑部面临的任务是在报刊述评之外再经常在《真理报》上发表“报纸巡礼”的文摘。在这些“文摘”里报道报纸上所发表的最有意义的材料，转载它们的主要的内容，支持编辑部工作中的创议和良好的倡议，抓住和综合报纸所提出的特别重要的问题，并且把它们提到全苏联的论坛上去。“报纸巡礼”的文摘是包罗万象的，凡是短小的报刊述评的形式它都有：专题述评，报导性述评，某一期报纸、个别材料的述评，批判性的述评和赞扬性的述评。
    “报纸巡礼”栏一出现之后，立刻在报纸工作者和《真理报》读者中间受到了广大的欢迎。在五个月中（一九四七年十二月到一九四八年四月），这一栏在《真理报》上出现了三十八次。一共刊载了一三八篇短小的述评和消息。
    现在已经可以把《真理报》所蓄积的某些经验加以综合，而且可以得出结论：小型报刊述评工作的方向应该怎样？这些结论也适用于共和国、边区和省的报纸。
    依照“报纸巡礼”栏所发表的材料的内容，这些述评可以分成几类。是哪几类呢？
    （一）第一类述评是《真理报》借来支持地方报纸所提出的最重要的问题的。
    可以举几篇述评为例，它们的题材如下：关于马格尼托高尔斯克联合厂里储藏着的多余的和不需要的物资（摘自市的报纸《马格尼托高尔斯克工人报》）；关于开垦新地（摘自雅罗斯拉夫报纸《北方工人报》）；关于工厂里的技术情报部的工作（《斯大林格勒真理报》）；关于防旱森林（《阿尔泰真理报》）；关于集体农场生产的电气化（《乌拉尔工人报》）；关于在托姆斯克建立自己的燃料基地（《红旗报》）；关于企业里的繁用消费品工场（《塔姆波夫真理报》）。
    应该指出：《真理报》所支持的地方报纸的言论都引起了广大的社会的反应，不论是地方机关或是中央机关都由于这些言论而采取了各种措施。由于那篇论及马格尼托高尔斯克联合厂的储藏不需要的物资的新闻，有几个政府机关发出指示给各自所属的企业，命令它们检查仓库和使用那些多余的物资。苏联交通部见到了发表在宾札省卡明斯克区报上的以《报纸达不到村镇》为题的通讯之后，采取了许多的措施。一九四八年一月三十日，在“报纸巡礼”栏发表了一段题为《技术情报部在干什么？》的消息。消息中报告，《斯大林格勒真理报》批评了拖拉机制造厂技术部的工作成绩不良。不仅是汽车拖拉机工业部，甚至别的部，也都因这段报道而作出了相当的结论。
    边区和省的报纸，《真理报》也如此，都必须抓住区、市和工厂的报纸的最有价值和最尖锐的言论。
    为了达到这些目的，如果报纸上出现了个别的论文和通讯，它们提出了对共和国、省、边区是富有重要意义的巨大问题，就必须把它们转载。这样也可以表示我国所出版的许多机关报的相互作用。
    （二）《真理报》“报纸巡礼”栏所发表的报道性的述评和消息。《真理报》依照报纸的材料，报道地方生活中有趣的事实和新闻。例如下列种种都可以归入这一类：关于少女积极分子大会（《卡巴亭真理报》）；关于第一个一百万超计划利润（《伏尔加公社报》）；关于劳动保护研究所的工作（《列宁格勒晚报》）；关于集体农场的科学日（奥德萨《布尔什维克旗帜报》）；关于西比利亚的地毯（《红土墩报》）。
    共和国、边区、省的报纸应该广泛地利用区和市的报纸来报道各区、市、工业、集体农场和国营农场的生活。
    （三）支持创议、支持地方报纸编辑部工作中的有价值的倡议的述评和消息。下面几个例子就是这一类的消息：灌溉建设区的农村通讯员岗位（奥辽尔省的区报《斯维尔德洛夫斯克真理报》）；在编辑部举行的矿山会计员座谈会（斯大林诺城《拉疆斯卡·顿聂青那报》）；赛米巴拉丁斯克省和巴夫洛达尔省的报纸的农业问题意见交换栏；报纸上对于农业中的前进分子的经验的宣传（《库尔斯克真理报》，《伏尔加公社报》）；报纸上的斯塔哈诺夫工人和工程师革新家的讲座（《札波罗什布尔什维克报》）。
    共和国、边区和省的报纸同时必须全面支持和传布区、市、工厂的报纸工作中的创议和经验，展开报纸编辑部的活跃的创造竞赛。
    （四）批评报纸工作中的缺点和这种或那种材料中所犯的错误的短小的述评。例如，一九四八年一月五日，《真理报》在“报纸巡礼”栏中发表了一段以《必要的解说》为题的消息。消息中说：诺伏布杨斯克区的报纸在一篇专论中对于基层的党组织在录取新党员方面作了不正确的指导。据《真理报》消息，后来因此联共（布）库壁希夫省委采取了相当的决定。五月二十日，发表了一段关于《乌德摩尔特真理报》上刊载的两篇材料的短小的批判性的述评。因为该报没有为了扩大日用消费品的生产而进行彻底的斗争。
    因此，我们可以看出，报刊述评的形式是多么多样和有趣，同时它们对于改进和提高报纸的全部工作有着多么重大的意义。
    如果没有批评，没有有益的分析，没有报纸工作经验的研究和总结，报纸就不可能顺利发展和改进。所以一切形式的报刊述评都应该在共和国、边区、省的报纸里占据一席相当的地位。
            二  报刊述评应遵守的要求
    报刊述评的作者，也就是说，报纸的编辑，应该遵守哪些必需的要求呢？
    第一个要求是报刊述评不要对报纸的偶然的失着吹毛求疵，而要从本质上、从根本的原则问题上去分析报纸的内容和工作。应该指出，有些观察家常常批评小节，挑剔失错的字句、笔误，因此把我们报纸的缺点变成取笑和讽嘲的对象。
    举几个这一类述评的例子。
    有一次，基洛夫省比张斯克区的报纸《布尔什维克之路报》印错了期数。省报《基洛夫真理报》认为应该为这件事发表一段《最近来邮》的消息。这段消息题为《最老的区报》。消息中写道：
    “比张斯克区的报纸《布尔什维克之路》的创刊号是在什么时候出版的呢？据编辑部的资料（见报头旁的期数），从创刊号至一九四六年二月七日已出版了一七、一一五期。只要计算一下该报定期出版的时间，不难断定，《布尔什维克之路》的创刊号问世于克里米亚战争（一八五四——一八五六年）进行最紧张的时期。所以为了这一点，应该向比张斯克的这个报纸道贺！”
    该省另外一个报纸《斯大林之路》（杜精斯克区的报纸）印错了出版的日期。省报专为此事刊载了一段“最近来邮”，题目颇恶毒，叫《梦想成为事实？》。该文作者只根据了一个事实，就无微不至地责难区报的编辑，责备他懒惰，责备他在编辑桌上打瞌睡等等。
    斯达夫罗波尔边区李卜克纳希区的报纸发表了几篇字句不通的广告。《斯达夫罗波尔真理报》决定专为此事说话。边区报纸的编辑部应该告诉区报的编辑们，他们签字之后，还有检查报上所刊载的文稿的责任，因为广告的内容也要他们负责的。但是《斯达夫罗波尔真理报》述评家并不采取这样的严肃的办事态度，而决定讽嘲区报的编辑。“最近来邮”的消息是这样结束的：“在这种情况之下，该报也可能出现这样的内容的广告：‘编辑部里来了一个不负责任的编辑，文稿发排之前，经过所有的人读过，唯有几个人是不读的，那就是签字付印的人。’”
    对报刊述评采取这样的态度，于报纸编辑部是很少裨益的，是很难使他们学到什么东西的。正相反，不正确的攻击性的论调只会引起区报工作者们的气愤，而在读者眼里则会使报纸的名誉扫地。如果我们只从报纸上摘取微小的失错，不妥当的字句，以此来代替真正的布尔什维克的批评，那是不会有多大裨益的。我们需要的是灵敏的原则性的批评，必须能揭发报纸上真正的缺点，教育报纸工作者，暗示提高报纸工作的道路。
    这里应该提一提斯大林同志于一九二五年一月二十六日在联共（布）中央组织局会议上为了《德莫斯卡报》的事讲话时所说的话。那时斯大林同志在谈到我们的作家和通讯员时指出：“……应该倾听这些同志的声音，而不是讽嘲我们报纸的工作人员。”
    我们的述评家必须从原则性的、党性的立场来批评这个或那个报纸，必须批评报纸在最重要的问题方面的路线，而不是仅仅“吹毛求疵”。当然，我们一定要严厉批评报纸工作中的错误和缺点，特别要批评字句不通和文字草率。不过必须批评得严肃，而且要使人心服，让编辑能从批评中得出结论。
    第二个要求也应该严格遵守，——那就是批评报纸工作必须抱客观的态度。
    有时候遇到这样的事实，就是省和边区的报纸的述评家对述评的编辑抱着不诚恳的态度。这样的述评家并不严肃研究报纸的内容，检阅报纸于某一个时期中在这个或那个问题方面的路线，材料一到手，他立刻就开始作出各种结论和推论。检查结果，这些结论是毫无根据的，理由不充分的，述评中有着偏颇和歪曲的地方。
    客观性——对于报纸上发表的任何材料，都是最重要的要求，同时也是报刊述评作者所应该遵守的。
    第三个要求，非常重要的是必须在述评里指出我们报纸的典型的缺点，必须在述评中提出我们报纸工作的根本问题。述评不但对于发表它所检讨的材料的报纸，而且对于许多报纸，都应该富有教育意义。
    同时应该指出：中央、共和国、边区和省的报纸必须及时对现实的急要的题材发表述评和用相当的方法指导报纸。
    第四个要求，述评家必须估计到他所检讨的报纸的现实的条件：它的编排版式，出版的定期性等等。同时检讨报纸对这个或那个领域的工作、这个或那个运动等的报道时，不应该根据资料的数量，而必须根据资料的素质，必须根据思想政治的水平。
    第五个要求是从述评的一般的党性的意义中出来的。在批评报纸方面，观察家应该经常在述评中提出党领导报纸的问题，党组织和共产党员在报纸中合作的问题。党委和党组织应该了解，如果报纸受到批评，也就是他们的工作受到批评，所以应该以党组织的全部力量来消除缺点，使自己的机关报成为模范的报纸。
    报纸编辑部处理报刊述评时的基本要求就是这几点。
            三  共和国和省的报纸上的报刊述评
    最近各共和国、边区和省的报纸改善了对区和工厂的报纸方面的工作，开始时常刊载报刊述评。许多报纸编辑部增辟了“各区报纸巡礼”部。
    研究述评之后可以看出，在许多边区和省的报纸上已经开始刊载关于各区报纸工作问题的良好的成熟的言论。但是也出现了一些比较差的不熟练的述评。
    我们来简短地检讨一下报刊述评的某些特征的缺点。在这方面，我们可以依照下述三种题材来检讨报刊述评：区的报纸上关于农村经济问题的报道，党的生活问题的报道，各区报纸执行宣传职务的状况。
    区报纸上的农村经济问题  这一类的述评中有些述评的基本缺点是述评家没有顾到在区报纸上报道集体农场生产问题时所应有的特点。因为我们知道，区的报纸报道任何农村经济运动，必须和省的、地方的报纸有所不同。
    拿春耕来做例子。省的报纸，在它的视野之内有三十个到五十个区，当然要注意，全省、各区以及个别拖拉机站、集体农场、工作队中的播种工作进行得怎样。但是它无法把每一个集体农场、每一个拖拉机队的播种工作怎样进行的情形有系统地报道给读者。区的报纸的情形就完全不同。它只是为一个区服务，在它的视野之内只有两三个拖拉机站和几十个集体农场。对于区报纸，就可以要求它日常注意直接在每一个集体农场中和每一个工作队中怎样组织和进行播种工作。区报纸是和集体农民，和拖拉机驾驶员接近的。区报纸的篇幅第一步应该面对他们，应该和他们谈话，首先应该用共产主义的劳动态度来教育他们。这一种情形确定了作为最富有群众性的报纸的区报纸的面目。借此也可以大部分确定了区报纸工作的相当的形式和方法。
    区报纸的特点和性质，在一九四○年七月十三日的联共（布）中央决议中非常清楚地规定着。看这一决议是怎样说明的罢：
    “区报纸必须有表情明确的面目，反映出本区的生产特点和经济。这种报纸应该大部分充满着地方性题材的文章和通讯，并且广泛地吸引本区的党、苏维埃、团的领导工作人员和专家到报纸上来发言。”
    应该说明，远非所有的区报纸都有表情明确的生产面目，可惜省报纸很少教育区报纸的工作人员，应该怎样把区报纸做成群众的战斗的报纸。
    许多经济题材的述评的第二个缺点是这种述评时常并不教育各报编辑部在报道实际经济问题时的政治立场。
    报纸是政治的机关。在为执行经济计划的斗争中，在党、苏维埃、经济组织的工作的报道中，它必须表现高度的布尔什维克的思想性、原则性和敏锐性。政治与业务是分不开的。假使这报纸刊载春耕、秋收、缴粮的消息，那末它在进行这些运动时就必须学会从政治的立场报道集体农场的具体任务，把区的任务和全国的任务联系起来。对于集体农场、拖拉机站和国营农场领导者的实际业务工作，报纸必须不是从官厅的，而是从政治的、党的观点来评价。
    共和国报纸和省报纸的编辑部在报刊述评中要号召反对业务问题报道中漠视政治，要在具体的材料中显示给区报纸的工作人员看，什么叫做对于现象、对于业务生活的实践采取政治的、党的立场。
    省报纸对于评述经济题材的工作的第三个缺点是题材的狭隘性。省报纸时常只是表现区报纸报道农村经济运动的活动。这自然是对的。但是也应该注意，报纸怎样从事集体农场生产的各方面。这里要注意到为严守农村经济组合规章的斗争、发展饲畜业的问题、电气化、村政设施、建筑及其他等等。
    区报纸上的党的生活的问题  最近共和国报纸和省报纸开始时常发表区报纸和市报纸所刊载的有关党的课题的材料的述评。
    出现过不少很好的很有意思的述评，在这些述评里正确地报道了区报纸、市报纸处理党的生活栏的问题。
    但是研究有关党的课题的报刊述评之后，发现这些述评时常有着重要的缺点。
    也像报道经济的述评一样，省报纸的编辑部并不总是顾到区报纸报道党工作问题的特点，也不具体说明，区报纸首先应该从事什么工作。我们完全清楚，区报纸的注意中心，应该是基层党组织的生活。报纸必须广泛地和全面地报道党组织的活动，概括它们组织的和群众政治的工作的经验，说明共产党员在集体农场生产中怎样担任先锋队的角色，怎样进行群众宣传鼓动，怎样提高自己的思想政治水平。
    省报纸、边区报纸、共和国报纸应该教导区报纸编辑部正确地报道党的建设的问题，给他们提示比较更重要，比较更急要的题材。当然，不难明了，省、边区、共和国报纸的编辑部对于党的工作的问题应该是非常熟悉的。关于这一点应该指出，反而在某些报刊述评上遇到这一方面的错误。例如在《土库曼火花报》上，在一九四八年三月底，刊载了一篇《布尔什维克》报的述评，题为《是不是应该这样报道党的生活》。在这篇述评里提出了些重要的问题，其中第一部分是并不引人怀疑的。但是在述评的末了，这份共和国报纸竟对于省报纸和区报纸提出这样的意见：“报道党生活的报纸，它的任务必须从这里出发：在自己的篇幅上善于表现和严格区分党工作、群众政治工作以及党对于业务工作的监督”。这种淆乱的公式会使省报纸和区报纸的工作人员弄糊涂。什么叫做区分党工作、群众政治工作和党的监督呢？难道还不清楚，党组织的力量正就是在于统一一切党的政治与组织工作的形式，党领导业务和监督业务的成功，是靠善于把党工作和群众工作联系起来以及其他等等。
    应该责成熟悉党的建设问题和能够给区报纸提供怎样处理党生活栏以有见地的工作人员来写作有关党的题材的报纸述评。
    区报纸的执行宣传职务  一九四○年七月十三日联共（布）中央《关于区报纸》的决议说：
    “区报纸的基本任务是在日常宣传党与政府的现行政策和措施的基础上来对劳动者作思想政治的教育，这种宣传要依据当地实践中以及本区、集体农场、企业生活中的具体的、接近的和容易理解的事实。”
    这一条十分清楚地规定了区报纸的基本任务。中央、共和国和省的报纸必须说明，区报纸怎样来执行自己的主要责任，帮助它们真正成为劳动者的政治教育的机关报。
    可惜，区报纸的这一基本任务直到现在还是落在我们许多报纸的视野之外。在共和国和省的报纸上，关于执行区报纸宣传职务、关于区报纸实现自己教育任务的述评少到极点。因为，我们虽然有些区报纸能够很好地解决这一任务，但是，相反地，也有许多报纸显然不能胜任这种任务。
    不错，区报纸的宣传作用有时也在其他题材的述评中论述到，但是只是顺便提到，而不是作为主要的题材。然而这是现在报纸工作的最主要的问题呀。
    为了在走向共产主义的道路上加快向前推进，为了更充分地利用我们所有政治的、经济的、文化的和组织的可能，应该多方地加强人民的共产主义教育工作。因此，党把思想教育问题，发展苏维埃人民社会主义自觉的问题放在第一位并不是偶然的。这任务必须作为党组织的注意中心，我们报刊的注意中心，因为我们的报纸是群众政治启蒙和教育的有力工具。
    应该详尽而清楚地向区报纸的工作人员解释，区报纸应该怎样、经过什么道路、用什么方法和形式来实现自己的宣传和教育的职务。应该说明，不仅是专门的宣传文章，而且所有一切各种不同的报纸材料——从通讯到科学论文，从速写和小说到新闻报道——必须服务于一个目的：用共产主义精神，用爱国主义精神和苏维埃民族的自豪来教育苏维埃人民。
    假使我们从这一个观点看一下我们报纸工作的实践，那末我们可以看出，已发表的所谓当前课题的材料的教育意义是很小的。它们对政治太漠视了。报纸时常不把个别工厂、集体农场、国营农场的劳动人员的具体任务和全国执行战后斯大林五年计划的总任务联系起来。这当然，并不就是说，所有报纸材料都应该嵌进适当的特定的句子。不是的，问题是要提高我们报纸上所刊载的文章、通讯、新闻的思想政治水平。斯大林同志教导说，报纸应该“……用科学的社会主义之光来照明工人所碰到的每一个现象。”（斯大林文集俄文版第一卷第九页）。应该使报纸的工作人员学习从政治的立场去走近经济与文化生活的每一个现象。
    关于这一点，加里宁曾经说过：
    “苏维埃新闻记者应该寻找每一个局部现象和总的现象的联系，局部和整体统一的联系，这正是符合人们社会生活的真正发展的。提供各种不同的材料——从集体农场获得成功的通讯到深刻的科学论文，从消息报道到艺术性很高的作品；苏维埃和无线电工作人员，在这种材料中间反映我们日常生活中的形形式式，以及人的灵魂的一切曲曲折折，在这样处理的时候，会不可避免地，同时又是不知不觉地展现出列宁斯大林思想在实践中的胜利，列宁斯大林的思想正就是社会发展的客观规律的表现”。
    任务是在于怎样教育区报纸的工作人员善于实现报纸的教育的、宣传的职务。
    在地方报纸和省报纸的编辑部里没有专门的报刊述评栏。那一部门应该从事述评的工作呢？在实践上是各有不同的。大部分报馆是把这一工作责成党的生活部来做的，某些报纸是由秘书处、宣传部来从事述评工作的。我们认为前者是对的：报刊述评应该由党的生活部来做。
    但这并不就是说，只有党的生活部的工作人员才能作述评的作者。应该吸引所有比较熟练的编辑人员来做报刊述评工作。每一个新闻记者都应该把写述评和借此来帮助区报纸工作人员的工作认为是对党的责任、自己职业上的义务。也应该吸引自己的通讯员来做这一工作。他们一定很熟悉区报纸的工作，注意着区报纸的内容，能够发表述评文章。
    在每一个共和国、边区、省报纸的编辑部里对于区报纸组织经常的观察、阅读，是很重要的。关于这一点，应该介绍一个有效的方法：把一份或是几份报纸划定给编辑部的某些工作人员。应该知道，述评的题材常常正是在观察报纸、每日阅读邮件之后产生的。
    共和国、边区和省报纸用报刊述评来帮助党机关实现对区报纸的思想政治领导，区报纸是我们报纸中数量最大和人数最大的队伍。为了顺利地完成这一重要的、责任重大的工作，各报编辑部应该：
    （一）有计划地发表市、区、工厂报纸的述评，借此来领导他们的工作，用切实的意见和具体的指示来帮助它们。
    （二）在“市区报纸巡礼”中，报道地方报纸所刊登的较有意义的材料，概括报纸所提出的特别重要的问题，支持报馆工作中的自发性和宝贵倡议。
    （三）提高报刊述评的质量和思想政治水平。述评的中心在于：区报纸怎样执行自己的基本责任，为了使每一张报纸变成群众政治教育的战斗机关，应该如何作法。
                                    （冰夷译）
