　　Lecture Series at the Fourth People's Education Center: Today's Topic: "What Was Old China Like?"
    [This Newspaper] The political class organized by the Beijing Fourth People's Education Center concluded yesterday (the 28th). Because the audience was extremely interested in the courses taught in this phase (New Outlook on Life, A Brief History of Social Development, General Knowledge of Current Events), they sent letters or came directly to the center to request continued sessions before the end of the political class. The center has decided to hold a lecture series twice a week, starting at 7:00 PM every Wednesday and Friday. The general topic for the first month is "The Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution." All sectors are welcome to attend the first lecture tonight (the 29th), which is "What Was Old China Like?"

　　第四民教馆讲座班今讲“旧中国是啥样子？”
    【本报讯】京市第四民教馆主办的政治班已于昨（二十八日）结束。由于听众对这一阶段所讲课程（新人生观、社会发展简史、时事常识）兴趣极大，于政治班结束前，纷纷致函或直接来馆要求续办。该馆乃决定举办讲座班，每周举行两次，每星期三、五晚七时开始。第一月的总题是“中国革命的基本问题”。今（二十九日）晚第一讲为“旧中国是啥样子？”欢迎各界前往听讲。
