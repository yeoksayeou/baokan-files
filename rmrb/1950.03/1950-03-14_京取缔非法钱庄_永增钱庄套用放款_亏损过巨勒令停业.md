　　Beijing Bans Illegal Private Banks
    Yongzeng Private Bank Used Embezzlement Loans; Suffered Excessive Losses and Ordered to Cease Operations
    [Beijing News] The Yongzeng Private Bank in this city engaged in illegal profiteering, and the manager embezzled loans and deceived to increase capital, resulting in excessive losses and inability to pay debts due. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has reported to the competent authority and ordered it to cease operations from the 4th of this month and liquidate within a time limit. The bank's board of directors is studying selling assets to repay debts. When the government ordered capital increase last May, Wang Zhenting, then chairman and manager of Yongzeng Private Bank (who held 90% of the bank's shares), deceived the government and did not actually increase capital. Instead, he borrowed gold, cloth, etc. from other sources at high interest rates, sold them, and presented them for inspection. Afterwards, Wang Zhenting borrowed the names of other businesses to embezzle loans from Yongzeng Private Bank to make up for this deficit. As a result, due to the compounding of principal and interest, old debts were not repaid, and new debts became even larger. Wang himself was heavily in debt, which also implicated Yongzeng Private Bank, leading to stagnant loans. Many of the borrowers were Wang's creditors, making it impossible to recover the loans. At the same time, Yongzeng Private Bank made loans to the industrial and commercial enterprises run by the manager himself, such as the loans to Yihua Woolen Factory (Wang Zhenting had one-third of the shares in this factory), which accounted for half of its total loans; and Jianzhong Trading Company (operated by Tang Junwu, the new chairman of Yongzeng Private Bank) also received 70 to 80 million yuan. These loans could not be recovered for the time being, which also hindered the bank's business, causing losses to increase day by day, reaching a maximum of 190 million yuan. After the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China discovered this situation in December last year, in order to protect the interests of depositors, it immediately ordered Wang Zhenting to find reliable guarantors and repay the debts within a time limit. As of January 31, in addition to the guarantors raising 80 million yuan and selling a portion of Yongzeng Private Bank's shares for 40 million yuan, the manager of the bank, Wang Zhenting, did not actually sell assets to repay the debts, and Yongzeng Private Bank's losses were still not made up. In addition, internal complexities, personnel infighting, and the failure to get the business on the right track, led to the use of borrowed funds to make up for the day's position in mid-February, resulting in the inability to make up the exchange difference. Finally, in late February, it formed a capital turnover failure, and debts due could not be repaid. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has reported to the Municipal Finance Committee and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, ordering it to cease operations and liquidate within a time limit. The shareholders of the bank, such as Chen Liquan, Dou Gongying, Tian Kuoting, and Wang Molin, are all relatively powerful figures in Beijing's industry and commerce. The old and new chairmen of the bank, Wang Zhenting and Tang Junwu, also have assets. They expressed that they will sell assets to repay debts and will never let depositors suffer losses.

　　京取缔非法钱庄
    永增钱庄套用放款  亏损过巨勒令停业
    【北京讯】本市永增钱庄非法营利，经理人套用放款，蒙混增资，致亏损过巨，不能支付到期债务，中国人民银行北京分行已呈准主管机关于本月四日起令其停业，限期清理。该庄股东会正研究变卖产业清偿债务。去年五月政府明令增资时，永增钱庄当时董事长兼经理王振亭（据有该庄百分之九十的股权）蒙混政府，并未实际增资，而自己由他处以高利借入黄金、布匹等变卖呈验。事后王振亭又借用其他商号名义套用永增钱庄放款，弥补此项亏空。结果，因本利相滚，旧债未还，新债更大，王本人负债累累，因此也就连累到永增钱庄放款呆滞，放款户中很多都是王的债权人，放款无法催还。同时，永增钱庄放款给经理人自己兼营的工商业，如放给艺华毛织工厂（该厂有王振亭三分之一的股款）的款占其全部放款额的半数；放给建中贸易公司（该公司为永增钱庄新董事长唐君武所经营）的也有七八千万元。这些放款一时都不能收回，因此也就妨碍了该庄的业务，使亏损日益增多，最高曾达一亿九千万。中国人民银行北京分行于去年十二月间查获此一情况后，为保证存款人的利益，当即令王振亭觅具妥保，限期清还债务。至一月三十一日，除由保人凑借八千万元，并以永增钱庄股权出卖一部计四千万外，该庄经理王振亭并未实际售产清偿，永增钱庄的亏损仍未弥补，加以内部复杂，人事倾轧，业务未上正轨，二月中旬即以借入款弥补头寸，致无法补足交换差额，终于二月下旬，形成周转不灵，到期债务不能偿还。中国人民银行北京分行已呈准市财委会及中国人民银行总行，令其停业限期清理。该庄股东如陈丽泉、窦公颍、田阔亭、王墨林等都是北京工商业中比较有实力的人物，该庄新旧董事长王振亭、唐君武也有资产，他们表示将变产偿债，绝不使存款人遭受损失。
