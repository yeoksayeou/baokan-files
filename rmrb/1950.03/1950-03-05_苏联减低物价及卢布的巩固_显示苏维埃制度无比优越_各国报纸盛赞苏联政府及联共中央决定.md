Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th -- Comprehensive TASS news: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic have all published the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party on reducing state retail prices of food and manufactured goods, as well as the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers on changing to gold as the calculation standard for the ruble exchange rate and raising the ruble exchange rate against foreign currencies, with large-character headlines in prominent positions.

            Germany

    The New Germany, the organ of the German Socialist Unity Party, commented: This new measure makes a decisive contribution to raising the living standards of the Soviet working people. At the same time, it has the same effect on the working people of countries that maintain close economic relations with the Soviet Union. The decision of the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party reflects the unparalleled achievements of the Soviet people.

            Czechoslovakia

    Labor News, the organ of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, commented: The Soviet Union's massive price reduction and ruble consolidation provide brilliant proof of the superiority of the Soviet socialist economy over the capitalist economy. It is a manifestation of the new development of the strength and power of the Soviet state, and it shows the people of the world that the Soviet system is one that eradicates exploitation, anarchy of production, crises, and unemployment, and guarantees the happy labor, bread, and peace of the working people.

            Hungary

    Free People's Daily, the organ of the Hungarian Workers' Party, commented: The Soviet Union's further price reduction—the brilliant achievement of Stalin's Fourth Five-Year Plan—encourages the Soviet people to work harder and achieve new successes in socialist competition. This will also push the Hungarian working people to strive for the victorious completion of the Five-Year Plan, for high labor productivity, for systematically and greatly reducing production costs, and for new achievements in socialist competition.

            Bulgaria

    Izgrev News in Bulgaria commented: The possibility of the Soviet Union's price reduction and ruble exchange rate increase is the result of the brilliant achievements of Soviet industry and agriculture.

            Romania

    Spark, the organ of the Romanian Workers' Party, commented: This decision shows the great Stalin's paternal care for every Soviet man and woman.

            Mongolia

    People from all walks of life in the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic warmly welcomed these important measures of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, and believe that these measures are a significant indicator of the steadily growing Soviet economic strength.
