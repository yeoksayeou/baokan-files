　　On Anglo-American Contradictions
    By Kruman, translated by Fu Ying

            A Hostile Partnership
    The contradictions between Britain and the United States are growing day by day. Nevertheless, in essence, Anglo-American imperialists are colluding with each other.

    Duddy wrote in his book "Britain's Imperial Crisis": "British imperialists believe that it is only under the overall rule and control of the United States that it is possible to maintain the British Empire. ... Thus, this special relationship between Britain, the Dominions, and the United States has developed: Britain conflicts with the United States and then submits to it, which is a hostile partnership, with the United States occupying a dominant position."

    It is precisely because Britain continues its imperialist policies that it has caused the dollar panic. Britain spends 240 million pounds annually on overseas military adventures, which is much larger than Britain's trade deficit and roughly equal to the total amount of dollars Britain receives from the Marshall "Aid" program.

            Struggle for Markets
    As the capitalist depression intensifies, the struggle for markets in the shrinking capitalist world intensifies accordingly, and the struggle for markets between the most powerful capitalist country, the United States, and its main rival, capitalist Britain, is particularly fierce.

    The right-wing leaders of the British Labour Party boast that the devaluation of the pound will greatly increase British exports to the United States. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Britain has increased its exports to the United States. On the contrary, since the devaluation of the pound, British exports to the United States, valued in dollars, have never reached the level before the devaluation, and American competition has been growing.

    Lord, Chairman of the Austin Motor Company, declared at the end of November 1949: "Despite the devaluation of the pound, the number of cars sold by our company in the United States is only half of the number sold 18 months ago when the American market had not yet declined."

    American political leaders declare every day that the British must work harder, increase production, and increase exports; but American small industrialists are gathering to defeat the competition from the products of Western European countries. On January 17, American small manufacturers held a national conference, the purpose of which, according to its secretary, Strackbein, was to "study the threat of increased competition from Europe and elsewhere."

    But the pressure from American big monopoly capitalists is much greater than the pressure from small industrialists. American big monopoly capitalists are not only resisting British competition, but also, with the development of the crisis of overproduction, are preparing to invade the British market. Take the oil problem as an example.

    The British Fuel Ministry announced at the end of December that it was necessary to drastically reduce oil imports from American sources, and that British importers must first absorb the surplus of British oil companies. The American oil trusts were furious.

    Approximately 140,000 barrels of oil are imported into Britain daily from American-owned sources. This year, new British refineries in Venezuela and the Middle East have started operations. Britain and Sweden are discussing a barter agreement under which the British government hopes to supply Sweden with large quantities of oil in place of American oil. British and American oil companies are competing to supply Japan with approximately $5 million worth of oil annually. Britain's large-scale reduction of dollar oil imports will greatly save dollars. The heads of the American government unanimously told Britain to reduce the dollar deficit - but they all agreed that Britain's method of reducing the dollar deficit must not harm the interests of American exporters, especially the interests of important exporters such as oil.

    "The issue of Britain's reduction of oil imports and expansion of its own refining capacity is rapidly developing into a major political issue. ... If the British government supports the British oil combine, then how will the American government support the American oil companies?" (Washington correspondent of "The Observer", January 1st.)

            Seizing Britain's Imperial Markets
    American big capitalists are now launching a new and determined offensive to accomplish one of their fundamental goals - namely, seizing Britain's long-term imperial markets. This recent offensive is hidden under the "generous" plan to reduce Britain's sterling debts. Britain's sterling debts still amount to 3 billion pounds (including 1.3 billion pounds owed to India, 500 million pounds owed to Egypt, 400 million pounds owed to Australia, 300 million pounds owed to Iraq, and huge sums owed to Israel and New Zealand). In the year ending June 1949 alone, Britain's unrequited goods exports to these countries amounted to 280 million pounds.

    The American Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce issued a report entitled "Better Currency," urging a quick resolution of the sterling debts. This report said: Sterling debts are "the main obstacle to the real recovery of the world. ... It is a major problem that American taxpayers and Britons must solve."

    What is the "generous" solution proposed by the American Committee (chaired by Heinz II, with members including Reed, Chairman of General Electric, Wolters, Chairman of U.S. Steel, and Giannini, President of the Bank of America)?

    The solution is: "A rapid reduction of British debt, with the United States partially guaranteeing installment payments in dollars in return."

    That is to say, reduce British debt, and the reward for reducing debt is for American trusts to seize Britain's markets in these countries.

    Britain is not allowed to offer any resistance. The report said that this plan is to be enforced by threatening to cancel American aid: "If the United States continues to provide material assistance to friendly foreign countries, the United States expects and demands that the recipient countries take reasonable self-help measures, yes, even making concessions to the American methods of goods production and trade... The constructive reorganization of the debts Britain incurred as a result of World War II - namely, the current frozen sterling deposits - should begin immediately. This will be a major factor in proving that aid under the European Recovery Program should continue."

    How the "generosity" of the banks, steel companies, and baked bean companies is implemented is made clear in the U.S. Department of Commerce's 1948 report on "Trade between the United States and the Overseas Territories of Beneficiaries of the European Recovery Program."

    The results of their "generous" actions are revealed as follows:

    In 1948, American exports to French overseas territories - Morocco, Algeria, and Vietnam - reached 79.4 million U.S. dollars, while in 1938 they were 9 million U.S. dollars; an increase of 775 percent.

    In 1948, American exports to the Belgian Congo reached 48.778 million U.S. dollars, while in 1938 they were 1.875 million U.S. dollars; an increase of approximately 2,500 percent.

    In 1948, American exports to Indonesia reached 96.732 million U.S. dollars, while in 1938 they were 27.482 million U.S. dollars; an increase of 223 percent.

    In 1948, American exports to British Malaya reached 520.87 million U.S. dollars, while in 1938 they were 8.791 million U.S. dollars; an increase of 831 percent (the numbers here are probably incorrect - translator's note).

            Unifying Europe
    The U.S. State Department, the executors of the Marshall Plan, Republican senators, army leaders, Hearst newspapers, and Wall Street bankers are all advocating "European unity." When Hoffman came to Europe last October and Acheson came to Europe last November, they demanded "an economically unified Western Europe" and the formation of a "single market of 275 million Western European people."

    Wall Street has such a great interest in the "unification" of Western Europe, and its main purposes are four:

    1. For strategic war purposes, they need a unified battlefield from which they can launch aggressive offensives against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. They need a single European command under American control, a single source of cannon fodder and secondary war materials.

    2. They are destroying all forms of "protectionist tariffs" and economic and financial barriers within Western Europe in preparation for opening up Western Europe as a single market to American goods. They are making the various currencies of Western Europe convertible with each other in preparation for making them convertible into dollars.

    3. They are economically, politically, and militarily integrating U.S.-controlled West Germany into Western Europe in order to further turn Europe into an American colony and to control Europe with German trusts under American command. West German factories are increasingly being controlled by American capital. Opening up all markets to West German goods (which are produced in these factories by workers employed at starvation wages) will further lower the living standards throughout capitalist Europe.

    4. They are unifying Western Europe and shifting Western European trade towards Western Europe itself, hoping that the Western European countries will increasingly move away from their long-term markets outside of Europe.

    Therefore, in recent months, the United States has been increasingly increasing its pressure on Britain, forcing the British government to accept the policy of European unity. The Ruhr Management Committee is responsible for deciding how much coal, coking coal, and steel are supplied to Germany for consumption and how much is exported to other countries. On this committee, the United States effectively controls eight votes out of fifteen, its own three votes, Germany's three votes, and Luxembourg and the Netherlands' two votes. Now, through the so-called Franco-Belgian-Dutch-Luxembourg-Italian Group, the United States wants to expand these broad powers to include the heavy industries of these five countries. This group of American-controlled Western European heavy industry does not include Britain, but requires Britain to "approve."

    The British imperialists' weak efforts to form a group controlled by Britain consisting of the three Scandinavian countries and Britain have failed, not only because the Scandinavian people oppose this system of exchanging their cheap exports for Britain's high-priced goods, but also because the United States is pressuring them to turn towards West Germany.

    Washington is using all economic, political, and military pressure to force Britain to quickly approve European unification. It is becoming clearer day by day that the United States of Europe means America's Europe.

            Anglo-American Contradictions in the Far East
    Last September, Anglo-American negotiations in Washington attempted to "adjust" Anglo-American Far East policies. As soon as the negotiations ended, Anglo-American contradictions deepened.

    In early December last year, U.S. Senator Smith (the Republican leader on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) demanded that the United States occupy Taiwan, and declared: Regarding the Far East, "The British attitude towards the issues has been - and probably will continue to be - fundamentally different from that of the United States. Britain has significant commercial interests in the Far East, while the United States has never had significant commercial interests. Britain, in its current difficult financial position, naturally wants to maintain these commercial interests. This commercial pressure will prevent Britain from taking a long-term view and may lead Britain to adopt a current policy of compromise appeasement, which endangers the entire future of the Far East."

            U.S. Monopolizes Major Weapons
    Even in their planned imperialist aggressive anti-Soviet war, the partnership between Bevin and Truman is becoming increasingly strained due to inherent contradictions, leading to great tension in recent months. The policy of the American government is to have Britain engage in the production of secondary war materials, while the United States monopolizes major weapons, especially the atomic bomb. This policy has never been welcomed by Britain.

    The London Observer said: "Anglo-American cooperation is now extremely strained. ... The main problem is the failure of the atomic bomb negotiations between Britain, Canada, and the United States."

            Only the British People Can Defend National Independence
    As the capitalist panic deepens and Anglo-American contradictions become increasingly acute, we see more clearly the lesson that if the British government's policies are fundamentally the same as Wall Street's policies, then no matter how much their interests conflict, the British government will ultimately succumb to American reaction.

    If the British government refuses to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the new China, it will not be able to resist the American offensive to seize markets. If the British government continues to exploit the colonial peoples and wage a colonial war against the people of Malaya, it can only surrender to the American offensive to seize Britain's long-term markets. If the British government plans an anti-Soviet war, it will not be able to resist the "unification" of Europe, and will not be able to oppose the reconstruction of fascist West Germany and militarist Japan under American control.

    The struggle for national independence, against the United States turning Britain into a colony. This is the most urgent task in the anti-economic panic and anti-war struggle of all the British people. This struggle can only be carried out under the leadership of the working class today. The working class can unite all truly patriotic forces to carry out this struggle.

　　论英美矛盾
    克鲁曼著  福英节译
            敌对的合伙关系
    英国与美国之间的矛盾是一天比一天地增长着。虽然如此，在基本上英美帝国主义者是狼狈为奸的。
    杜德在其所著《英国的帝国危机》中写道：“英国帝国主义者认为只有在美国的总的统治和控制之下才可能想法保持英帝国。……于是、英国、诸自治领、和美国之间的现在这种特殊的关系就发展起来了：英国与美国发生冲突，而又向美国屈服，这是敌对的合伙关系，而美国则占支配地位。”
    正是因为英国继续其帝国主义的政策，结果引起了美元恐慌。英国每年用于海外军事冒险的费用达二亿四千万镑，这比英国的贸易逆差之数要大得多，大约与英国从马歇尔“援助”计划所得的美元总数相等。
            争夺市场
    资本主义的不景气日甚一日，争夺在日益缩小的资本主义世界中的市场之斗争就跟着剧烈化起来，而最强大的资本主义强国——美国与其主要敌手——资本主义的英国之间的争夺市场之斗争则特别厉害。
    英国工党右翼领袖们吹牛说，英镑贬值会使英国的对美的输出大量增加。可是，没有什么证据表明英国增加其对美国的输出。恰恰相反，自从英镑贬值以来，英国对美国的输出，以美元计值，从来没有达到英镑贬值以前的水平，而美国的竞争则日益增长。
    奥斯汀汔车公司董事长劳德，在一九四九年十一月末宣称：“虽然英镑贬值，本公司在美国所卖的汽车，只达十八个月以前美国市场尚未衰落时所售的数目之一半。”
    美国政治头目们每天宣称英国人须加紧工作，增加生产，和增加输出；但美国小工业家却集合起来，以打败西欧诸国的产品的竞争。一月十七日，美国小制造家召开全国大会，此大会的目的，据其书记斯特拉克拜因说，是“研究从欧洲及其他地方来的加剧的竞争之威胁。”
    但美国大独占资本家的压力是比小工业家的压力要大得多。美国大独占资本家不仅仅是对抗英国的竞争，而是随着生产过剩的危机之发展，准备要侵入英国市场。就以石油问题为例吧。
    英国燃料部在十二月末宣布必需大量削减从美国来源的石油输入，英国入口商须首先吸收英国的石油公司的剩余。美国石油托拉斯乃大发雷霆。
    每天从美国所拥有的来源输入英国的石油约十四万桶。今年，英国设于委内瑞拉与中东的新炼油厂开工了。英国与瑞典正在商谈一个易货协定，英国政府希望根据此一协定，以大量石油供给瑞典，代替美国石油。英国与美国的石油公司正在竞争，以供给日本每年约值五百万美元的石油。英国大量削减美元石油之输入，将大大节省美元。美国政府的首脑们，一致告诉英国要减少美元不敷——但他们一致同意英国减少美元不敷之方法，必须不损及美国出口者的利益，尤其是像石油这一类的重要的出口者的利益。
    “英国削减石油输入与扩大英国自己的炼油能力，这一问题很快地发展成为一个重要的政治问题。……如果英国政府支持着英国的石油康拜因，那末，美国政府将如何支持美国的石油公司呢？”（《星期观察者》华盛顿记者，一月一日。）
            夺取英国的帝国市场
    美国大资本家现在开始一个新的坚决的攻势，以完成其根本目标之一——即夺取英国的长期的帝国市场。这一最近的攻势，是隐藏在减除英国的英镑债务之“慷慨的”计划之下。英国所负的英镑债务，尚有三十亿镑（包括欠印度的十三亿镑，欠埃及的五亿镑，欠澳洲的四亿镑，欠伊拉克的三亿镑，和欠以色列及新西兰的巨款）。在一九四九年六月为止的一年中，英国单是输往这些国家的无报偿的货品，数达二亿八千万镑。
    国际商会美国委员会发表一个报告，题为“更好的货币”，敦促迅速解决金镑债务。这一报告说：金镑债务是“世界真正恢复的主要障碍。……是美国纳税者也是英国人所须加以解决的一个主要问题。”
    美国委员会（主席是海恩兹第二，委员中有奇异电气公司董事长理德，美国钢铁公司董事长乌尔特斯，美国银行行长季安尼尼）所提出的“慷慨的”解决方法是什么呢？
    解决方法是：“英国债务迅速削减，而由美国部分保证分期付予美元，以为报酬。”
    这即是说，把英国债务削减，而削减债务的酬谢，就是由美国托拉斯将英国在这些国家中的市场夺取过去。
    不许英国有任何抵抗。该报告说，这计划是要以取消美援为威胁来强制实行的：“如果美国继续以物资援助友好的外国，美国就期望着而且要求着受惠国采取合理的自助的措施，是的，甚至对美国的货物生产与贸易之方法让步……英国因进行第二次世界大战所欠下的债务——即现在的冻结的金镑存款——之建设性的改组应立刻着手。这将成为证明应该继续欧洲复兴计划的援助之一个重大因素。”
    银行、钢铁公司、与烤豆公司的“慷慨”如何付诸实施，在美国商务部一九四八年关于《美国与欧洲复兴计划受援国的海外属地之贸易》的报告，就表现得很清楚。
    它们的《慷慨的》行动的结果，显露出来，就是：
    在一九四八年，美国对法国海外属地——摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和越南——之输出达七千九百四十万美元，而在一九三八年为九百万元；增加了百分之七百七十五。
    在一九四八年，美国对比属刚果之输出达四千八百七十七万八千美元，而在一九三八年为一百八十七万五千美元；约增加百分之二千五百。
    在一九四八年，美国对印尼之输出达九千六百七十三万二千美元，而在一九三八年为二千七百四十八万二千美元；增加百分之二百二十三。
    在一九四八年，美国对英属马来亚之输出达五亿二千零八十七万美元，而在一九三八年为八百七十九万一千美元；增加百分之八百三十一（这里的数字怕有错误——译者注。）
            统一欧洲
    美国国务院、马歇尔计划执行人、共和党参议员、陆军头子、赫斯特报纸、与华尔街银行家，齐声主张“欧洲合一”。在去年十月霍夫曼到欧洲来，去年十一月艾奇逊到欧洲来，要求“一个在经济上统一的西欧”和组成一个“有二亿七千五百万西欧人民的单一的市场。”
    华尔街对于西欧“统一”有这么大的兴趣，其主要目的有四：
    一、为着战略的战争目的，他们需要有一个统一的战场，他们能够从此一战场向苏联及诸人民民主国家发动侵略的进攻。他们需要在美国控制下的单一的欧洲指挥部，单一的炮灰和次要战争原料的来源。
    二、他们摧毁了在西欧内部的一切形式的“保护关税”以及经济的与财政的壁垒，以准备把西欧作为单一的市场向美国货物开放。他们使西欧各种货币能互相兑换，以准备使它们能兑换为美元。
    三、他们把美国所控制的西德，在经济上、政治上、和军事上合入于西欧，以使欧洲更进一步地成为美国殖民地，并以美国所指挥的德国的托拉斯来控制欧洲。西德的工厂日益受美国资本之控制。一切市场都向西德货物（它们是在这些工厂中以食不饱的工资雇用工人所生产出来的）开放，将使资本主义的欧洲各地的生活标准更加降低。
    四、他们使西欧统一起来并使西欧的贸易转向着西欧本身，希望西欧诸国日益离开其欧洲以外的长期的市场。
    所以，在最近几个月来，美国日益增加其对英国所加的压力，强迫英国政府接受统一欧洲的政策。鲁尔管理委员会负责决定煤、焦煤、和钢多少供给德国消费，多少输出给别国。在这个委员会，十五票投票权中，美国实际控制了八票，美国自己的三票、德国的三票、以及卢森堡与荷兰的二票。现在，通过所谓法比荷卢意集团的机构，美国要把这些广泛的权力扩大到把这五国的重工业都被包括进去。这个由美国控制的西欧重工业集团，并不包括英国，但要英国“赞同”。
    英国帝国主义的微弱的努力，要使斯干的那维亚三个国家与英国组成一个由英国控制的集团。这一努力是失败了，不仅是因为斯干的那维亚人民反对以他们的廉价的输出品换取英国的高价的物品的这种制度，而是因为美国压迫它们转向着西德。
    华盛顿以一切的经济的、政治的、和军事的压力迫使英国赶快赞同欧洲统一。一天比一天明显，欧洲的合众国意味着美国的欧洲。
            英美在远东的矛盾
    去年九月间，英美在华盛顿的谈判，企图“调整”英美远东政策。谈判刚结束，英美的矛盾就加深了。
    在去年十二月初，美国参议员斯密士（参议院外交委员会中的共和党头子）要求美国占领台湾，并宣称：关于远东，“对于问题的看法，英国的态度曾经是——而且大概将继续是与美国根本不同。英国在远东有重大的商业的利益，而美国却从来没有重大的商业的利益。英国处于现在的困难的金融地位，自然是想保持这一商业利益。这一商业的压力，会使英国不能采取长远的看法，而可能使英国采取目前的妥协绥靖政策，而危及远东的整个未来。”
            美国独占主要武器
    甚至，在它们的准备帝国主义的侵略的反苏战争中，贝文与杜鲁门的合伙关系，也因内在的矛盾日益增长，以致几个月来很紧张。美国政府的政策，是要英国从事生产次要的战争物资，而由美国独占主要的武器，尤其是原子弹。这一政策从未为英国所喜。
    伦敦观察报说：“英美合作现在是关系极为紧张。……主要问题是英、加、美三国间的原子弹谈判之失败。”
            只有英国人民才能保卫民族独立
    随着资本主义的恐慌日益深刻，英美矛盾因而日益尖锐，我们就更看清楚这一教训，即：英国政府如果其政策是根本与华尔街的政策相同，那末，不管它们的利益如何冲突，英国政府最后仍是向美国的反动屈服。
    英国政府如果拒绝与苏联、东欧、及新中国建立友好关系，就不能抗御美国争夺市场的攻势。英国政府如果继续剥削殖民地人民，并进行反马来亚人民的殖民地战争，就只能向美国夺取英国长期的市场的进攻投降。英国政府如果计划反苏战争，就不能抵抗欧洲的“合一”，就不能反对法西斯主义的西德与军国主义的日本在美国控制之下重建起来。
    为民族独立的斗争，反对美国把英国变成殖民地。这是在英国全体人民的反经济恐慌与反战争的夺争中的最紧迫的任务。这一斗争，今天只有在工人阶级领导之下才能进行。工人阶级能够团结所有的真正爱国的力量来进行这一斗争。
