　　Focusing Leadership on Industry and Mining
　　Significant Improvements in Production at 宣化 State-Owned Factories and Mines
　　[Our Dispatch] According to the 察哈尔 Daily News on the 25th, since mid-February, the CPC 宣化 Municipal Committee and Municipal Government have focused their leadership on factories and mines. With the efforts of workers and staff in various state-owned factories and mines, production has greatly improved. The Yantongshan Mine has shifted from opposing waste and promoting production and conservation to a record-breaking campaign. The South Adjacent and Nanshan Inclined Shafts, as well as the Western 16th, 19th, and 20th Pits of the mine, have broken past conventions and implemented deep-hole operations. As a result, consumption has decreased and output has increased. The South Adjacent Inclined Shaft has risen from a previous high of 70 tons per day to 98 tons. The pit excavation team (manual drilling) advanced 9.6 meters in half a month, equivalent to 20 days of work in February. Although the Western ore transportation team was reduced by 20 people, the efficiency of the No. 1, 2, and 3 chutes increased from 155 carts per day to 190 carts. The No. 7 team of the Pangjiabao Mine, which repaired the West Second Level Adit of East No. 44, proposed suggestions for repairing the mine car tracks and digging drainage ditches. After the administration accepted and implemented these suggestions, the problems of cars bumping the frames, derailing, and getting stuck were eliminated, increasing the amount of stone ballast pushed per worker per shift from two carts to more than four carts. The electromechanical team of the mine has significantly improved its production enthusiasm after resolving the disunity between new and old workers. In the past, one drill bit could only drill one inch and two fen deep, but now it can drill eight inches. The current problems in various factories and mines are: the leadership's reliance on the working class ideology is still insufficient, the factory management committees are mostly ineffective, workers' inventions and creations are not promptly commended and promoted, and the cadres' ideological complacency and lack of willingness to learn have caused them to fall behind the workers' rising production enthusiasm.

### 领导重点放到工矿  宣化国营厂矿生产大有改进

　　领导重点放到工矿
    宣化国营厂矿生产大有改进
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报二十五日消息：自二月中旬中共宣化市委、市府把领导工作的重点放到工厂矿山，各国营厂矿工人、职员的努力，生产大有改进。烟筒山矿场已由反对浪费开展生产节约，转入创纪录运动。该场南邻、南山二斜井及西部十六坑、十九坑、二十坑等，均打破以往成规，实行了深孔作业，结果消耗减少、产量提高。南邻斜井由过去日产七十吨的最高标准，上升至九十八吨。该坑掘井组（人工打眼）半个月即进尺九点六米，等于二月份二十天的工作效能。西部运矿组虽减少二十人，但一、二、三号溜子效率却由过去的每天运一百五十五车增至一百九十车。庞家堡矿场修复东四十四号西二平巷的第七组，提出整修矿车道及挖水沟的建议，经行政接受实行后，免去了车啃框、掉道、卡车的毛病，由过去每工一班推二车石碴，增至四车多。该场机电组，由于解决了新老工人之间的不团结，生产情绪显见提高。过去沾一根钎只能打一寸二深眼，现能达到打八寸。现在各厂矿存在的问题是：领导上依靠工人阶级的思想还很不足，工厂管理委员会大多不起作用，工人的发明创造未被及时表扬、推广，加之干部思想上存在着自满与不虚心学习，因而赶不上工人高涨的生产情绪。
