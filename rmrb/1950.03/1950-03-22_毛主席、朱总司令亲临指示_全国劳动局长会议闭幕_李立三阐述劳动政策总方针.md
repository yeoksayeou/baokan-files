Xinhua News Agency, 21st -- The National Labor Bureau Chiefs' Conference, lasting two weeks, concluded on the 20th. In addition to the representatives of the National Labor Bureau Chiefs' Conference, all the representatives of the National Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union Congress also attended the closing meeting. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu also attended the meeting and were warmly welcomed by all the representatives. Commander-in-Chief Zhu also made a brief speech. In his closing remarks, Li Lisan, Minister of Labor, pointed out that thanks to the joint efforts of the local labor bureau chiefs, trade union representatives, and representatives of industrialists and businessmen attending the meeting, the drafts of the "Provisional Trade Union Law," "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises," "Provisional Organizational Rules for Provincial and Municipal Labor Bureaus," "Organizational Rules for Labor Exchange in Various Cities," "Measures for Registering and Introducing Unemployed Skilled Workers," and "Instructions on Carrying out Workers' Spare-Time Education" discussed at this meeting were improved. Among them, the labor-capital relations issue was discussed for a longer time, and the gains were also greater.

Minister Li pointed out: "Developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" is the general policy of new democratic economic construction, and also the general policy of the Central People's Government's labor policy. In order to effectively change the status of workers in production, state-owned enterprises must do a good job in the factory management committee and implement democratic management. In private enterprises, a new labor-capital relationship of democracy, equality, and mutual benefit should be established through contracts. Because the foundation of the old labor-capital relationship in which capitalists relied solely on oppression and coercion to rule workers has been destroyed by the people's revolution. If a new new-democratic labor-capital relationship is not established to replace it, private enterprises will not be able to improve production. The specific manifestations of the new relationship are: first, signing collective contracts, labor contracts, and collective agreements; and second, establishing labor-capital consultation meetings. Labor-capital consultation meetings can not only supplement the inadequacies of collective contracts, but more importantly, enable the management of the capital side to obtain a new method to replace the old management method of relying on oppression and coercion. Under our new democratic regime, on the one hand, capitalists should not and cannot continue to use the old management methods of the past. On the other hand, the working class does not need to adopt the strike struggle methods of the past to protect their legitimate interests, but can adopt new methods of negotiation, consultation, and requesting mediation and arbitration by the labor bureau to achieve this goal. Labor-capital consultation meetings do not infringe upon the capital side's management rights and ownership of the enterprise, but only enable the capital side to adopt new management methods, adopt democratic consultation methods, and absorb the opinions of the workers to give play to the labor enthusiasm of the working class and improve production. At present, production cannot be improved in places where new labor-capital relations have not yet been established. This should attract the attention of both labor and capital, especially the capital side. Minister Li said: We believe that new labor-capital relations will definitely be established, because this is conducive to the development of production, and is in line with the interests of the capital side and the interests of the working class.

　　毛主席、朱总司令亲临指示
    全国劳动局长会议闭幕
    李立三阐述劳动政策总方针
    【新华社二十一日讯】历时两周的全国劳动局长会议已于二十日闭幕。在闭幕会上，除全国劳动局长会议代表外，尚有全国邮政、电信工会代表大会全体代表参加。毛主席、朱总司令亦到会，受到全体代表的热烈欢迎。朱总司令并作了简短致词。劳动部李立三部长在闭幕词中指出，由于出席会议的各地劳动局长、工会代表与工商业者代表共同努力，使这次会议讨论的“工会暂行法”、“关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示”、“省市劳动局暂行组织通则”、“各市劳动介绍所组织通则”、“失业技术员工登记介绍办法”、“关于开展工人业余教育的指示”等草案益臻完备。其中尤以劳资关系问题讨论时间较长，收获也较大。
    李部长指出：“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”是新民主主义经济建设的总方针，也是中央人民政府劳动政策的总方针。为了切实改变工人在生产中的地位，公营企业必须做好工厂管理委员会的工作，贯彻管理民主化。在私营企业中则应建立民主的平等的两利的契约的新劳资关系。因为资本家单靠压迫强制来统治工人的旧的劳资关系的基础已被人民革命摧毁了，如果不建立起新的新民主主义的劳资关系来代替，私营企业便无法搞好生产。新关系的具体表现，一为签订集体合同、劳动契约以及集体协议，一为设立劳资协商会议。劳资协商会议不仅可以补充集体合同之不足，而且更重要的是使资方的经营管理获得一个新的方法，来代替依靠压迫强制的旧的管理方法。在我国新民主主义政权下，一方面，资本家不应该也不可能沿用过去的旧管理方式，另方面，工人阶级也不必要采取过去那种罢工斗争的方式来保护自己的正当利益，而可以采用交涉、谈判协商和请求劳动局调解仲裁的新方法来达到这一目的。劳资协商会议并不侵犯资方的经营管理权及其企业所有权，只是使资方采取新的管理方式，采用民主协商方法，吸收工人方面的意见，以发挥工人阶级的劳动积极性，搞好生产。目前，凡新的劳资关系尚未建立的地方，生产都不能搞好，这应引起劳资双方特别是资方的注意。李部长说：我们相信新的劳资关系一定会建立起来，因为这是有利于发展生产的，是符合于资方利益也符合于工人阶级利益的。
