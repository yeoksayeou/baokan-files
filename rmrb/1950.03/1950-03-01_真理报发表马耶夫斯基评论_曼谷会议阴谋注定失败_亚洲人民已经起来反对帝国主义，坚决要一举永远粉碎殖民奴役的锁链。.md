Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: TASS Moscow, 26th: *Pravda* political analyst Mayevsky commented on the Bangkok conference of American diplomats from Asian and Pacific countries, stating: Before the conference, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed by General Bradley, toured Japan and the Hawaiian Islands, where they discussed secret U.S. military plans and preparations in the Pacific.

The *New York Times* stated that the main task of the Bangkok conference was to find ways to consolidate U.S. policy on the Asian continent. This task was formulated in view of the failure of the adventurous policies of U.S. imperialism in the Far East, mainly in China, and the stormy development of the national liberation struggle of the Asian people.

One of the main items on the agenda of the Bangkok conference was the organization of military blocs of reactionary regimes in Asia. According to newspaper reports, the countries that the United States intends to bring together in this group include those countries where the forces of British imperialism are still very strong, such as India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as those countries that cater to the United States, such as Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Bao Dai group in Indochina, the puppet Syngman Rhee "government" in South Korea, and the remnants of the Kuomintang forces in Taiwan. According to the plans of American policymakers, the aggressive Pacific alliance should become a tool for the United States to combat the national liberation movements of the Asian people and a direct continuation of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty.

It is no accident that the United States plans to have Japan play the main role in this group. MacArthur is rushing to remilitarize Japan. However, Jessup is still not confident about the durability of the status of American puppets in Far Eastern countries. The American diplomats at the Bangkok conference expressed alarm in this regard and advocated greater support for anti-people regimes in Asia.

Everyone knows that U.S. imperialism is going all out in this regard. The United States has recognized the puppet Bao Dai, and they have thrown a new loaf of dollar bread to the South Korean executioner Syngman Rhee. In January of this year, the remnants of the Kuomintang forces in Taiwan received seventy-five American tanks in addition to other equipment, and they are expected to receive two hundred tanks in February.

The United States is drafting a "small" Marshall Plan for Asia and stipulating that "assistance" will be given to these countries according to the harsh conditions of the European Marshall Plan type. This plan is used to economically enslave Asia. The "small" Marshall Plan is a means for U.S. monopoly capital to continue its aggression against the economies of Asian countries.

The so-called "new" policy of U.S. imperialism in Asia discussed at the Bangkok conference is still that old policy of colonial enslavement, that is, a policy of aggression and war. It is doomed to failure, because the Asian people who have risen up against the imperialist aggressors are firmly determined to shatter the chains of colonial enslavement once and for all, and to defend their freedom and independence.

    曼谷会议阴谋注定失败 
    亚洲人民已经起来反对帝国主义，坚决要一举永远粉碎殖民奴役的锁链。
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：真理报政治分析家马耶夫斯基评论美国驻亚洲和太平洋国家的外交人员的曼谷会议称：会议召开之前，以布莱德雷将军为首的美国联合参谋长曾游历日本和夏威夷群岛，他们研讨了美国在太平洋的秘密军事计划和准备工作。
    纽约时报说，曼谷会议的主要任务，是寻觅办法以巩固美国对亚洲大陆的政策。这个任务是鉴于美国帝国主义的冒险政策在远东、主要是在中国的失败，和亚洲人民的民族解放斗争的暴风疾雨似的发展而制定的。
    曼谷会议议程上的主要项目之一，是组织亚洲各国反动政权的军事集团。据报纸的消息：美国打算纠合在这个集团内的有那些英国帝国主义的势力仍很强大的国家，例如印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、缅甸、马来亚、澳大利亚和新西兰，以及那些逢迎美国的国家，例如泰国、菲律宾、印尼、印度支那的保大集团、南朝鲜的傀儡李承晚“政府”和台湾的国民党残余力量。根据美国决策人士的计划，侵略性的太平洋联盟应该成为美国打击亚洲各国人民民族解放运动的工具和侵略性北大西洋公约的直接继续。
    美国计划使日本充任这个集团的主要角色并不是偶然的。麦克阿瑟正在急忙使日本重新军事化。但是，耶塞普对于远东各国的美国傀儡的地位的持久性仍不能放心。曼谷会议的美国外交人员对这方面表现出惊恐，并主张对亚洲各反人民政权予以更大的支持。
    大家都知道，美国帝国主义在这方面正拚其全力以赴。美国已承认傀儡保大，他们给南朝鲜的刽子手李承晚抛下了一块新的美元面包。在今年一月，台湾的国民党残余除了其他装备之外，又获得七十五辆美国坦克，预料他们在二月间会得到二百辆坦克。
    美国正在拟定亚洲的“小”马歇尔计划，并规定按照欧洲马歇尔计划类型的苛刻条件给这些国家“援助”。这个计划是用来在经济上奴役亚洲的。“小”马歇尔计划乃是使美国垄断资本能以继续侵略亚洲各国经济的手段。
    曼谷会议上讨论的美国帝国主义在亚洲的所谓“新”政策，依然是那个旧的殖民奴役政策，这就是侵略和战争的政策。它是注定了要失败的，因为已经起来反对帝国主义侵略者的亚洲人民，坚定地决意一举永远粉碎殖民奴役的锁链，并保卫他们的自由与独立。
