　　Sea Storm Report
    By Jiao Fuchun
    Some guessed that they probably encountered enemies on the way or that the raft had an accident. But the company commander said, "Actually, it's not certain. Maybe they've already held a memorial service for us back home, but aren't we still alive?"
    Rain on the island was often continuous. Liu Hongbin, the squad leader of the first squad, led Liu Hanchun to dig for wild grass on the mountain. Liu Hanchun weakly said, "Squad leader, it's no use digging, we're going to starve to death anyway!" The squad leader said, "Old Liu! We can't say that. We must seek survival from death. Digging for one more day means we can live for one more day. If we don't dig at all, we would have died seven or eight days ago. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De in Jinggangshan, and the Red Army during the Long March, survived by digging for grass. Don't be afraid, the Party and the higher-ups won't forget us, we will definitely be saved." Liu Hanchun said, "Yes! I often think, can the higher-ups forget about us? So I think we won't die." Life became more and more difficult. The vegetables, sweet potato leaves, and stems on the isolated island were all eaten, and finally even the sweet potato leaves pressed by excrement were picked up and eaten.
    Comrade Li Ye, who was in charge of cooking, fell ill. Liu Hongbin sat beside him and said, "There's nothing to eat here, Old Li! I can only come and talk to you a few more words every day! I'll take over your work during this time."
    We can't keep waiting like this, we must think of a final solution.
    On the 18th, the third Party branch committee meeting was held, and three paths were decided: first, to eliminate the bandits on the eastern island and capture a boat to go home. Even if we die fighting, it's better than waiting to starve to death here; second, to send someone to deliver a message again; third, to make individual wooden rafts, all tied with ropes, floating in the water, dragging everyone back. The first path had already been discussed among the soldiers. We will not wait for the neighboring bandit island to attack. Instead we will lure them to attack.
    These three methods were discussed in detail by the whole platoon. Deputy Platoon Leader Xie's opinion was: "Fight! Fight! Fight! Whoever doesn't fight is a coward!" He disagreed with the third path, saying, "People floating in the water in the dead of winter will turn into icicles even if they get home." Chen Zhongxin also agreed to fight, "There's nothing to eat here, and if we don't fight, in a few days, we won't need the enemy to defeat us, the wind will knock us down? If we fight, we can capture prisoners, boats, guns, bullets, rice, and steamed buns, and we'll even be reported on, it's both glorious and respectable!" As a result of the discussion, it was decided to take the first path.
    The work of shipbuilding began, and all available planks and poles were gathered together. Letters of challenge were sent to the Party branch committee from squad to squad and from individual to individual.
    The idea that the person who delivered the message has died is wrong.
    When Zhang Lixue and the others left, the wind and current were against them, and they had to pull the raft into the water before they could steer. Two sailors rowed, and the two of them steered. Although they tried hard to row northwest, they were actually going east. The large wooden rudder could not be steered because of the resistance of the water buoyancy. Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang thought irritably, "It's unlucky from the start!" Without a rudder, the raft had to drift with the current.
    Thankfully, the wind and current turned at midnight, all to the northwest, and the boat advanced rapidly in the direction of hope. Gradually, Jinshan Island, only a dozen miles from home, came into view, and closer, the car lights of the Huanhai Highway were clearly visible. Although their two wet legs were numb with cold, they were very happy in their hearts. Little Li said, "Platoon Leader! We will definitely be home by dawn, and we will be happy to death when we see our families." Zhang Lixue puffed on his sweet potato leaf cigarette, so happy that he couldn't hold the pipe.
    However, unfortunately, the worst northwest wind came again at four o'clock, and the tide receded, and the raft not only couldn't move forward, but instead retreated. Zhang Lixue ordered the boatmen to row hard to the north, but the sailors were out of breath and it was still ineffective. The boat drifted eastward. The next morning, it was decided to drop anchor and wait for the wind to turn, but the wind not only didn't turn, but became stronger and stronger, with black clouds all over the sky. "It will be terrible if it rains!" he thought, and it was indeed terrible. Around two o'clock in the afternoon, it started to rain, and overnight, their butts were all sitting in the water, but their upper bodies still retained some warmth, but this time, the only dry spot was also soaked.
    In the afternoon, the anchor rope broke, and the wind and waves were even bigger than the day of the accident. The raft completely lost its independent ability to move, and was subjected to the ups and downs of the wind and waves. Giant waves tens of feet high threw the raft up and down, and the four people all held tightly to a sturdy wooden pole. Later, the compass, rudder, and other things on the boat were all thrown off. Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang said, "Tie yourselves to the boat with ropes, in case of an accident." The raindrops brought by the storm hit the face like needles, and Zhang Lixue burrowed his body into the water. Covering his whole body with water seemed warmer, just like covering wheat with snow to prevent it from freezing to death. The wind and waves raged continuously for a day and a night. They hadn't eaten or drank for two days and two nights, and were very thirsty. Seawater was not good to drink. Zhang Lixue used both hands to catch the rainwater flowing from the hat and drink it. The hands of the two sailors also developed a string of blisters.
    They couldn't see an island, didn't know east, west, north, or south, and drifted aimlessly in the water for three or four days.
    On the fourth night, they suddenly heard birds singing in the air. The sailor said, "Great, there's an island!" But Zhang Lixue couldn't hear anything. He was so hungry that he was like a dead man, lying motionless on the raft board, his feet swollen like fermented circles from being soaked in water. When Little Li saw this, he burst into tears, and the two sailors also cried. Zhang Lixue opened his eyes and managed to sit up, saying, "Don't cry, I won't die for another half day." Little Li cried even more sadly. Zhang Lixue used all his strength to stand up, glared with his eyes sunken in their sockets, and said sternly, "Little Li! Are you afraid of death?" Little Li said to the platoon leader with tears in his eyes, "Platoon leader, I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid you'll die, and I won't be able to complete the task, and besides, it doesn't matter if we die, but won't the comrades on the island be finished too?"
    It dawned, and suddenly they spotted an island ahead. The raft gradually approached, and suddenly they saw plainclothes men on the mountain. The platoon leader's heart skipped a beat, they might be the enemy. He asked the sailor, "What place is this?" The sailor said, "It might be ×× Island (enemy territory)!" Zhang Lixue broke free from the numbness formed by cold and hunger, and pulled out his Mauser pistol. He thought, "It's over! This time the mission cannot be completed. Party! Comrades! We're going to fight." He told Little Li, "Now is our chance to sacrifice! Little Li, get ready, fight, and save a bullet for suicide!" Little Li said, "Okay! Platoon leader! I will definitely die with you!" The sailor, however, bowed to the heavens and the sea god, praying for God's blessing. (To be continued) (With picture)

　　海上风暴报告
    矫福纯  作
    有的揣测很可能路上遇到敌人或筏子出了事。但连长又说：“其实也不一定，大概家里给咱的追悼会也早开过了，可是咱们不是还活着吗？”
    岛上雨水经常绵绵不断。一班副刘洪宾领着刘汉春在山上挖野草。刘汉春无力的说：“班副，反正挖不挖都挡不了饿死！”班副说：“老刘！不能这样说，我们要死里求生，多挖一天就能多活一天，如果根本不挖，那七八天以前就该死了。毛主席、朱总司令在井岗山，红军在长征中，就是这样挖草挖活过来了。不要怕，党和上级不能忘掉咱，咱们一定能得救”。刘汉春说：“是啊！我也常想，上级还能忘了咱们吗？所以我想我们死不了的。”生活愈来愈艰难，孤岛上的菜、地瓜叶、梗都吃光了，最后连大便压的地瓜叶也拾来吃了。
    做饭的李业同志病了，刘洪宾坐在他身旁说：“这里什么吃的也没有，老李！我只能每天来多和你说几句话！这时期工作我代替你。”
    不能这样等待下去，必须想出最后的办法。
    十八日，第三次支委会又举行了，决定了三条道路，第一：去消灭东面岛上的土匪，捉船回家，不消灭拼死也比在这等着饿死强；第二：再派人送信，第三：做个人木筏子，都用绳拦上，在水中飘着，把大家拖回去。第一条道路，早已在战士们中谈论的，邻近匪岛不来攻，我们去诱惑他们来。
    这三个办法全排展开讨论，谢排副的意见是：“打！打！打！谁不打是熊！”他不同意第三条路说：“十冬腊月的人在水里飘，能到家也要变成冰棍。”陈忠新意见也是赞成打，“在这没得吃，再不打等几天不用敌人打，叫风也打倒了啦？打，能捉到俘虏、船、枪、子弹、大米、馒头，回去还会报上，又光荣又体面！”讨论的结果，决定走第一条路。
    造船的工作开始了，一切可利用的本板、杆子，都凑集起来，班与班、个人与个人的挑战信一封封送到支委会。
    认为送信的人已经死了的想法是错误的。
    张立学他们走的时候，风和流都是相逆的，要拉到水里才能按舵。两个水手摇橹，他俩按舵，虽然用力向西北摇，但实际是在往东走，大木舵受水浮力的阻挠怎么也按不上，张排副火剌剌的想：“一上来就是这样的不顺当！”筏子没了舵，只得随流飘荡。
    可喜，半夜风和流都转了，全向西北，小船向着希望的方向迅速前进了。逐渐的，离家只有十几里的金山岛望到了，再近，环海公路的汽车灯已十分清楚。他们虽然两条湿腿冻的发麻，但心中是十分高兴，小李说：“排副！天亮一定能到家，见了家里的人能快活死。”张立学嘴里抽着他的地瓜叶子烟，喜得含不住烟袋。
    可是，不巧得很，四点多钟，最坏的西北风又来了，潮水也退了，筏子不但进不动，相反后退了。张立学命令船夫，用劲向北摇，水手累得上气不接下气，仍是无效，船一流正东方向飘去。第二天上午决定抛锚，等风转再走，可是风不但不转，反而越来越大，满天一片黑云，“落雨才糟糕咧！”他想，果然糟糕得很。约摸下午二点，下起雨来，一夜间他们的屁股以下都是坐在水里的，但上身还保有点暖气，这一来，仅有的一点干地方也湿透了。
    下午锚绳断了，风浪比失事那天都大，木筏完全失去自己独立的动作能力，任受风浪的颠沛，数丈高的巨浪，把筏子抛上拉下，四个人都紧紧抱住一棵牢固的木杆，后来，船上的指南针、舵等都被甩掉了。张排副说：“都用绳子把自己绑在船上，防备万一。”暴风带来的雨点，打到脸上像针扎一样，张立学把身子钻在水里。全身以水遮风，似乎水里温暖一些，这和麦子拿雪盖不被冻死是一样的。风浪连续猖狂了一昼夜，他们两天两夜没有吃喝了，口渴得很，海水不好喝的，张排副用两只手接着从帽盖上流下的雨水喝，两个水手的手也磨起了一串血泡。
    他们看不到一个岛，不知东西南北，毫无目的地在水里飘了三四天。
    第四天的夜里，忽听空中有鸟叫，水手说：“好啦，有岛子啦！”但是张立学什么听不到，他饿得像死了一样，躺在筏板上一动不动，两只脚被水泡涨的像发酵的圈子一样。小李一看，便呜呜的哭起来，两个水手也哭起来。张立学睁开眼，好容易坐起来，说：“不用哭，我一半天死不了。”小李哭得更悲伤，张立学用尽吃奶的劲，站了起来，瞪着两只陷在眼眶中的眼，厉声说：“小李！你怕死吗？”小李流着泪对排副说：“排副，我不是怕死，我怕你死了，我完不成任务，再说咱死不要紧，岛上的同志们不是也完了吗？”
    天亮了，突然发现前面一个岛。筏子逐渐靠近了，忽然发现山上有便衣。排副心一怔，可能是敌人。问水手：“这是什么地方？”水手说：“可能是××岛（敌人地方）！”张立学挣脱了全身又冷又饥形成的麻木，拔出了匣子枪。他想：“完了！这一次的任务是不能完成了，党！同志们！我们要拼了。”他告诉小李：“现在是我们牺牲的机会了！小李，准备好，拼上，留一粒子弹最后自杀！”小李说：“好！排副！我一定和你死在一起！”水手却向老天爷，海魂作揖，祈祷上天保佑。（三续）（未完）（附图片）
