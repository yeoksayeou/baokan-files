Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th, TASS dispatch: Last year, 645 new animal breeding stations and veterinary stations were opened in the livestock breeding areas of the Soviet Union. The veterinarians and animal breeding experts at these stations provide free assistance to collective farms and state-owned farms in taking care of livestock. Due to improvements in animal breeding and veterinary services, livestock morbidity has decreased, and the reproduction rate has increased. National scientific research institutes and experimental centers have achieved great success in researching the nature of germs and inventing new methods to prevent infectious diseases in farm livestock. The production of medicines, instruments, disinfectants, and serums has been organized on a large scale. Soviet animal breeding experts have invented effective methods for livestock breeding and feed cultivation. All agricultural research institutes have set up special training classes for collective farm livestock breeders to popularize these scientific inventions. In 1949, nearly 700,000 animal breeding experts and poultry breeding experts graduated from these training classes.

　　苏联大规模开办饲养站兽医站
    牲畜生殖率大大增高
    去年一年内即训练将近七十万饲养专家
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：去年，在苏联牲畜饲养地区开办了六百四十五个新的动物饲养站和兽医站。这些站里的兽医和动物饲养专家，免费帮助集体农场和国营农场照顾牲畜。由于动物饲养和兽医业务的改进，牲畜患病率已经降低，生殖率则已增高。全国各科学研究院和各实验中心，在研究病菌的性质和发明新方法防御农场牲畜传染病等方面，获得了巨大的成就。医药、仪器、消毒剂和血清的生产，都大规模地组织起来了。苏联动物饲养专家已发明了牲畜饲养和饲料培植的有效方法。所有农业研究所都给集体农场牲畜饲养者设立了专门训练班，以普及这些科学发明。在一九四九年，有将近七十万个动物饲养专家和家禽饲养专家从这些训练班卒业。
