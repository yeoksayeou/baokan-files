Why Does the Yangquan State-Owned Coal Mine Retain the "Batou" System?
    By our reporter, Lin Li

    This newspaper published a report on the 21st about the Yangquan State-Owned Coal Mine failing to meet its production plan and the continued existence of the "batou" system. Before publication, the article was shown to the responsible comrades of the Yangquan Mining District Party Committee, the Yangquan Mining Bureau, and the mine's trade union. After reading it, the Party Committee immediately organized a working group, including two Party Committee members and six capable cadres, to go to the Fourth Mine to understand the truth and conduct two careful discussions and studies in a row. This serious and responsible attitude is very good. Although their understanding of several issues is not yet consistent, and the investigation is mainly limited to the "batou" system, they have initially found the answer to why the "batou" system exists to this day and the fundamental reason for the repeated failures of production tasks. The reporter now wants to publish the results of their observations.

    Why has the "batou" system in the Yangquan Mine been able to survive to this day, even though Yangquan has been liberated for three years? This is because the party and government leading cadres in Yangquan have not substantially recognized that "batou" is a feudal system of exploitation. On the contrary, they believe that "batou" are technical workers and a force that can be relied upon to develop production. From this understanding, a series of errors arose. The mine recruited workers by relying on large team leaders (i.e., what was called "batou" before liberation, the same below). They also relied on large team leaders to manage workers. Even things like paying wages and buying grain from cooperatives were handled by the large team leaders. Workers' work was controlled by them, their food and lodging were arranged by them, and the purchase of tools, lamp oil, and wage evaluation were all the responsibility of the large team leaders. The mine only collected coal at the time. The miners call this relationship "selling coal," meaning that the relationship between the workers and the mine is only realized through the large team leaders. Due to the erroneous understanding of the large team leaders, the mine unreasonably stipulated that "for every cart (0.6 tons) of coal produced, the large team leader would receive an extra tael of rice" in addition to the already high wages of the large team leaders. This method of "the group works, the team leader benefits" is obviously extremely unreasonable, so that the income of the large team leaders is even more than that of the "batou" in the past. It is completely wrong for the large team leaders not to work, but the factory allowed it to show "respect" for them, which has become a legitimate system. The workers are extremely dissatisfied with this and have raised many opinions without any effect. The workers sarcastically said that the large team leaders "are white-faced kiln blacks" and that "they are technical talents who don't hold hoes." The workers also wrote their protests on coal carts: "The Fourth Mine Director's thinking is impenetrable, and he shouldn't have used the large team leaders so muddle-headedly."

    In recent years, the production of the Yangquan Mine has relied on large team leaders, and the Party and the trade union of the mine have also been built on these people. According to Comrade Ren Puzhai, Secretary of the Yangquan Mining District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, they were once proud to have developed some large team leaders into Party members (the general idea). Even unremoulded large "batou" like Su Gentang were absorbed into the Party and designated by the Party Committee as a member of the General Branch Committee of the mine. Administratively, Su Gentang was also promoted to "General Consul," a position second only to the mine director, and controlled the power under the pit. The grassroots organizations of the trade union are basically built on the large team leaders. To this day, many trade union group leaders are still concurrently held by large team leaders. Trade union dues are "deducted" by the large teams, and workers collectively refer to the dues as "union tax." Last spring, the Yangquan Mining District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China found that many resolutions of the mine could not be implemented, the production plan could not be grasped, and even the mine could not decide on the allocation of labor. They had doubts about the section chiefs and team leaders who were promoted from "batou." Despite their doubts, the problem was not solved. Only the conclusion was drawn that "it is okay to rely on them to develop production, but it is fundamentally wrong for the Party and the trade union to rely on these people." (Secretary of the Party Committee) In fact, there are more than 370 party members in the mine (including cadres transferred from the old liberated areas), accounting for about 10% of the total number of employees. Thirteen of the 57 large team leaders have become Communist Party members, which means that 24% of the large team leaders have infiltrated the Party. After the publication of this newspaper's editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," the Yangquan Mining District Party Committee did not study it in depth in connection with the local specific situation. On the contrary, they believed that the failure to complete the production task was due to insufficient reliance on technical workers (referring to the "batou"). Therefore, they further proposed relying on technical workers (referring to the "batou") to develop production. This completely violates the spirit of relying on the working class to develop production repeatedly put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Worker's Daily's two editorials on opposing the "batou" system were a powerful warning to Yangquan, but the problem has not been solved. The Yangquan Mining District Party Committee has not yet realized that the large team leader system in Yangquan Mine is the "batou" system. At a meeting of the Party Committee attended by the reporter, some comrades of the Party Committee consulted newspapers from various places to find the definition of the "batou" system. They have been emphasizing that the Yangquan "batou" system is "special."

    According to the reporter's understanding, the person in charge of Yangquan Mine is wholeheartedly trying to do a good job. They also have a considerable understanding of the situation of the large team leaders. The Secretary of the Yangquan Mining District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China once showed the reporter the investigation of the large team leaders last year, which contained records of workers being bullied by large team leaders, how much wages and rice were embezzled by certain large team leaders, etc. There are also estimates of the role of large team leaders in production, and the pros and cons of preserving large team leaders for production are compared. However, they did not analyze these relationships from a class perspective. They regarded many problems as individual, accidental phenomena, or blamed the lack of scientific management system of industrial affairs. Therefore, they could not recognize the essence of the "batou" system, let alone clearly put forward the policy of opposing the "batou" system.

    Secondly, some leading comrades in the Yangquan mining area lack a sense of discipline. Therefore, many systems already stipulated in the mine are implemented very loosely. In many respects, there are even no systems. For example, workers do not register when they come to the mine to work, and do not ask for leave when they are absent or go out. To this day, no one can know the exact number of workers in the mine. The reporter once checked the employee attendance statistics, and the number of people on the form fluctuated, and the output also fluctuated. How can the person who makes the production plan be able to grasp the labor force and guarantee the successful completion of the production plan? In order to overcome this chaotic phenomenon, the Yugong Mine in the mining area stipulated in December last year that "those who have not been to work for five consecutive days will be fired." In early March, a member of the mine trade union asked for leave and did not return after the deadline. The mine wanted to enforce discipline, but was strongly opposed by the director of the trade union. According to Comrade Zhang Hongzhen, deputy director of the mine, after a quarrel over this matter, the discipline was invalidated. The mine once stipulated that workers should pass through the staff's hanging card (indicating that they have started work) and handing in card (indicating that they have finished work) system when they go to and from work. This can ensure working on time and prevent false reporting of black labor. The trade union cadres of Yangquan insisted that this was the bourgeois viewpoint of not believing in the working class, and said that the mine did not understand that it is now a new democratic society. From then on, it was changed to workers hanging up their own cards when they went to work and handing in their own cards when they got off work, which greatly facilitated the large team leaders to falsely report black labor. In February, excluding the Spring Festival holiday, there were only 24 days. The first team leader of the Fourth Mine actually took 32 days of wages. The mine paid wages on a team basis. The large team leaders eating black labor actually ate the workers' wages. Many workers therefore quit and went to find jobs elsewhere. The first team had 27 workers last year, and now there are only four old workers left. The "batou" system increased the mobility of workers and the destruction of labor discipline.

    Again, the relationship between local party and government agencies and the Mining Bureau is not coordinated. Let's not mention the historical issues for the time being, but from the current point of view, the mine complained that the local authorities interfered too much in administration (such as not going through the Mining Bureau for the New Year holiday, but sending notices directly to the mines). The local authorities said that the mine did not contact them enough. Especially the trade union issue, the local government wants to unify the mine trade union, and the mine trade union wants to establish an industrial trade union. In order to clarify the "batou" system, the local party and the local trade union organized an investigation team, and the Mining Bureau and the mine trade union organized a working group to understand the situation in the same mine at the same time. However, the local government did not make good use of the mine's investigation materials; the local government convened a situation report meeting and a research meeting on the "batou" issue of the Fourth Mine, but the mine did not participate, or sent minor cadres to listen. The mine once advocated launching a vigorous struggle against the "batou" system, while the local government believed that it was only necessary to reorganize the labor organization. The Party, government, trade union, and the Youth League of each mine are also not united. Especially the Yugong Mine, administratively has opinions on the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League, and the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League express dissatisfaction with the administration. There are bad phenomena of mutual disrespect and mutual discrimination between the deputy mine directors, and between the Party and the trade union. The creation of this disunity is related to the large team leaders sowing discord.

    The Secretary of the General Branch of the Fourth Mine said: When Su Gentang was a member of the General Branch Committee, he often said how bad the Party Committee was at the mine, and how wrong the mine was to the Party Committee, which gradually promoted the bad relationship between the mine and the Party Committee of the Fourth Mine. This should arouse our high vigilance.

    Finally, another reason why the mine's work has not been done well is that the superior lacks inspection and the subordinate does not summarize. In the face of such a major event as the failure to complete the production plan in 1949, the superiors did not investigate the reasons and check the responsibilities. The comrades below are almost living a muddle-headed life. When they fail, they do not look for lessons; when they succeed, they do not summarize experience. Like some serious problems that this newspaper has already revealed on the 21st, the Mining Bureau has not yet checked them, and the Yangquan Party Committee has only done preliminary research. The production task of the mine in March is very important. In addition to completing the production plan for March, it is also necessary to make up for the deficiencies in January and February. However, as of March 15, only 27,784 tons of the original planned 67,799 tons of coal had been completed, which is far from the planned figure. The success or failure of March is the decisive moment for the first quarter plan of this year. If the plan for the first quarter fails, the second and third quarters will enter the "off-season" of coal mine production, and the task will be more difficult to complete. Then, there is a danger of repeating the mistakes of last year this year. For such a major matter that is fundamentally related to the lifeline of national industrial production, the competent authorities should seriously check it and help the mine to achieve rapid and effective improvement.

　　阳泉国营煤矿为什么保留把头制？
    本报记者  林里
    本报二十一日发表了报道阳泉国营煤矿没有完成生产计划及至今尚存在把头制度的新闻。该文在发表前，曾交中共阳泉工矿区党委会、阳泉矿务局及矿工会等负责同志过目。党委看了以后，立即组织了包括两位党委委员、六位得力干部的工作组，前往第四矿了解真象，并一连做了两次慎密的讨论研究。这种认真严肃的态度是很好的。目前他们对若干问题的认识虽然尚不一致，而且调查的主要还仅限于把头制问题，但是对于把头制为何存在至今，以及生产任务屡遭失败的根本原因，已经初步地找到了答案。记者现在愿就自己观察的结果，发表出来。
    为什么阳泉解放已经三年，阳泉矿的把头制度竟能保存到现在呢？这是因为阳泉的党政领导干部实质上没有认识把头是一种封建的剥削制度，相反的，竟认为把头都是技术工人，是发展生产可依靠的力量。并由此得出了“离开他们煤矿闹不好”的错误结论。由这一认识出发，就产生了一系列的错误。矿方招收工人，依靠大组长（即解放前所说的把头，下同）。管理工人，也依靠大组长。甚至像发工资，到合作社买粮食这样的事情，也由大组长转手。工人做工由它支配，食宿由它按排，买工具、买灯油、评工资，统统由大组长负责。矿方只是到时收煤。矿工把这种关系叫做“卖炭”，就是说，工人和矿方的关系只是通过大组长而实现的买卖关系，由于对大组长认识的错误，所以矿方曾在大组长已经很高的工资之外，又毫无道理地规定“每出一车（零点六吨）煤，额外给大组长一两米”。这种“大伙劳动，组长得利”的办法，显然是极不合理的。以致大组长的收入比过去把头的收入还要多。大组长不劳动是完全不应该的，但厂方为了表示对他们的“尊重”，也就听之任之，无形中变成了合法的制度。工人对此极为不满，曾经提过不少意见，毫无效果。工人就讥讽说：大组长“是白脸窑黑。”“人家是不拿镢把的技术人材。”工人并且把他们的抗议写在煤车上：“四矿矿长思想打不通，不该糊里糊涂用上了大组长。”
    几年来，阳泉矿的生产依靠大组长，该矿的党和工会也曾经建筑在这些人的基础上。据中共阳泉矿区党委书记任朴斋同志谈，他们当时曾为发展了一些大组长为党员而骄傲（大意如此）。像苏根堂那种没有改造过的大把头也被吸收到党内，并被党委指定为该矿总支委员会委员。在行政上，苏根堂还被提拔为地位仅次于矿长的“总领事”，操纵坑下大权。工会的下层组织，基本上也是建筑在大组长身上。至今不少工会小组长还由大组长兼任。工会会费由大组“扣”，工人统称会费为“会税”。去年春天，中共阳泉矿区党委发觉矿方许多决议不能贯彻，生产计划不能掌握，甚至矿方对于劳力配备都不能决定，曾经对于从把头提拔起来的股长、队长发生了怀疑。怀疑尽管怀疑，问题并未解决，只是得出了一个：“依靠他们发展生产还可以，但党和工会停留在这些人身上则是根本错误的”的结论。（党委书记语）其实，该矿现有党员三百七十多名（老区调来的干部在内），约占职工总数百分之十左右。而该矿五十七个大组长中，有十三个成了共产党员，就是说，百分之二十四的大组长钻到了党内。本报“学会管理企业”的社论发表后，阳泉矿区党委并没有连系当地具体情况深入学习，反而认为：生产任务没完成，是由于依靠技术工人（指把头）不够，于是更进一步地提出依靠技术工人（指把头）发展生产。这就完全违背了中共中央一再提出的依靠工人阶级发展生产的精神。工人日报两次关于反对把头制的社论，对阳泉曾是一个有力的警告，然而问题还未解决，阳泉矿区党委这时还没有认识阳泉矿的大组长制就是把头制。在记者参加的一次党委委员会议上，党委的某些同志曾经翻阅各地报纸，寻找关于把头制的定义，他们一直强调阳泉把头制是“特殊”的。
    据记者了解，阳泉矿的负责人是一心一意想把工作做好的。对于大组长的情况，他们也有相当的了解。中共阳泉矿区党委书记曾把去年对大组长情况的调查给记者看，那上面有某某工人受了大组长的气，某某大组长贪污了多少工资米等等的记载。对于大组长在生产中的作用也有估计，并把保存大组长对生产的利弊也作了对比。但是他们没有用阶级观点去分析这些关系，他们把许多问题看成个别的、偶然的现象，或者诿过于工务管理制度的不够科学，因而不能认识把头制的本质，更不能明确提出反对把头制度的方针了。
    其次，在阳泉矿区某些领导同志中，缺乏纪律观念。因此，该矿已经规定的许多制度执行得是很松懈的。在许多方面甚至于没有制度。例如：工人来矿做工不报名，缺勤外出不请假。直到如今，没有人能够知道该矿工人的确实数目。记者曾经查看过员工出勤统计表，表上的人员忽多忽少，产量也跟着忽高忽低，订生产计划的人不能掌握劳动力，怎么能保证生产计划圆满完成呢？为克服这种混乱现象，该矿区裕公矿曾于去年十二月份规定“连续五天不上班者开除”。三月初旬，该矿工会某委员请假逾期未归，矿方要执行纪律，受到工会主任的强烈反对。据该矿副矿长张鸿珍同志谈：双方为此事争吵了一顿之后，纪律无形中作废了。矿方曾经规定了工人上班、下班时经过职员的挂牌（表明上工了）交牌（表明下工了）制度。这样可以保证按时做工，防止假报黑工。阳泉工会干部，硬说这是不相信工人阶级的资产阶级观点，说矿方不了解现在是新民主主义社会。从此以后，改为工人上班自己挂牌、下班自己交牌，给大组长们假报黑工大开方便之门。二月份除去春假只有二十四天，第四矿第一组大组长竟拿了三十二天的工钱。矿方发工资是以组为单位，大组长吃黑工实际上是吃了工人的，许多工人因此不干了，到别处找职业去了。第一组去年有二十七个工人，现在只有四个老工人了。大组长制增加了工人的流动性和对劳动纪律的破坏性。
    再次，地方党政机关与矿务局的关系是不协调的。历史上的问题暂且不提，仅就目前来看：矿上嫌地方机关干涉行政过多（如年关放假不通过矿务局，把通告直接下到各矿场去）。地方上则说矿上和他们联系不够。特别是工会问题，地方要统一矿工会，矿工会要成立产业工会。为了弄清把头制问题，地方党与地方工会组织了调查组，矿务局与矿工会组织了工作组，在同一时间到同一矿上了解情况。然而矿上的调查材料地方上不好好运用；地方上召集了情况汇报会与四矿把头问题研究会，矿上也不参加，或者派次要干部去听听。矿上曾经主张响亮地提出开展反把头制的斗争，地方上则认为只要改组劳动组织就可以了。各矿的党、政、工、团之间也不团结。尤其是裕公矿，行政上对党工团有意见，党工团对行政上表示不满。正副矿长之间、党与工会之间，都存在着互不尊重、互相歧视的恶劣现象。这种不团结现象的造成，与大组长的挑拨是非有关。
    第四矿总支书记谈：苏根堂任总支委员时，常在矿上说党委如何不好，到党委那里则说矿上如何不对，逐渐促成第四矿矿方和党委之间的关系不好。这是应该引起我们高度警惕的。
    最后，该矿工作没有作好的另一个原因，是上级缺乏检查，下级不做总结。像一九四九年没有完成生产计划那样重大的事件，上级竟没有追究原因，检查责任。下面的同志几乎是糊里糊涂过日子。失败了，不寻找教训；成功了，不总结经验。像二十一日本报已经揭露的一些严重问题，矿务局直到现在还没有检查，阳泉党委也只做了初步研究。该矿三月份的生产任务十分重大，除了要完成三月份的生产计划之外，还要补足一、二两月之不足。但到三月十五日，原定六万七千七百九十九吨的产煤计划，仅只完成了二万七千七百八十四吨。距计划的数字尚远。三月份的成功与失败，是本年度第一季计划的决定关头，倘若第一季度的计划失败，第二、三季度将要进入煤矿生产的“淡月”，任务更难完成。那么，今年又有重蹈去年覆辙的危险。对于这种关系国家工业生产的根本命脉的大事情，主管机关应该认真加以检查，帮助该矿求得迅速、确实的改进。
