　　Twenty-three Years of Hard Struggle
    ——Remembering Female Communist Party Member Wang Shulan
    Shan Qiao
    Wang Shulan, an old Communist Party member from the period of the Great Revolution and the wife of martyr Mao Zemin (Mao Zemin was Chairman Mao's fourth younger brother and was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Xinjiang), has persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for twenty-three years since joining the Chinese Communist Party in 1926, enduring the terroristic suppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the trials of a difficult life. When Chairman Mao frequently propagated to the poor farmers in his hometown of Xiangtan during the early revolutionary activities, she was influenced by Chairman Mao's revolutionary ideas and actions, and gradually cultivated a revolutionary consciousness. After joining the Communist Party, she actively led the women's liberation movement in her hometown. She held meetings and propagated everywhere, calling on women to rise up against feudal oppression and exploitation, and organized a women's federation, which quickly grew to more than 900 members. She became one of the leaders of the women's liberation movement in Xiangtan County.
    In 1927, the "April 12th" Incident occurred, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits betrayed the revolution, hunting down and killing revolutionary elements everywhere. Wang Shulan and five other Communist Party members were also arrested and imprisoned in Changsha on May 11th of the same year. After being arrested, Wang Shulan consistently demonstrated the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member who was firm and unyielding, and remained unmoved by the enemy's threats and inducements. The enemy even threatened her with the death penalty. Those arrested with her were anxious and wept for her. But she calmly said to those imprisoned with her, "For a Communist Party member, to die gloriously and to die greatly is the most valuable thing. When the enemy wants to kill me, you must not cry, crying only shows your weakness." When the Red Army attacked Changsha in 1930, she and other arrested comrades escaped from prison together.
    After the Red Army left Changsha, the reactionaries frantically hunted down and killed revolutionary elements again. Communist Party members who persisted in their work in Hunan cleverly retreated into underground activities, and Wang Shulan therefore lost contact with the Party. This caused her great distress. In order to avoid persecution by the reactionaries, she traveled back and forth between Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha, and Xiangtan. In 1937, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, and she thought, "My daughter has grown up and should go to the front line." She tried to have a friend take her only daughter, Mao Yuanzhi, to Yan'an. Before leaving, she earnestly told her daughter, "After arriving in Yan'an, you must study hard, obey the needs of the work. If they need you to carry a gun, you carry a gun; if they need you to go to the front line, you go to the front line."
    In 1938, she finally restored her Party membership in her hometown of Shaoshan Village. Her task was to establish a secret communication station in the Shaoyang and Linwu areas with another Communist Party member. At that time, her life was extremely difficult, often without enough to eat or wear. A comrade gave her a cotton-padded coat, which she wore for five whole years, completely covered in patches. When there was no food to eat, she went door to door begging. She once said to the comrade who worked with her, "Communist Party members should not care about life. The more difficult it is, the more we can understand the cruelty of the enemy, and the more we must seize the opportunity to do our work." Later, she learned to cut clothes by using waste paper and helped others with their work to maintain her livelihood. In the autumn of 1946, she had a serious illness and almost died because she had no money for treatment. Although she was often in a state of hunger and cold, poverty and illness, she always persisted in her work and never became discouraged. She and the other comrade who worked with her met every fifteen days to review their thoughts and work, and encourage each other. She often said, "The revolution has a future, it is bright and great. I have been in prison, can't I endure these hardships?"
    In the autumn of 1947, she heard the news of the People's Liberation Army's victorious counter-offensive, which made her extremely excited. From then on, their scope of work expanded even more. In addition to transportation and liaison work, they also went deep into the masses to carry out propaganda and education. Under the guidance of the higher-level Party, they also organized a guerrilla team, and she personally led the guerrilla team to deliver letters.
    After the liberation of Southern Hunan, her ten years of arduous transportation and liaison work came to an end. The guerrilla team took this hardworking and meritorious revolutionary veteran into the army. She is fifty-five years old this year, but for the first time in twenty-three years, she is living such a stable life, and for the first time, she is wearing new coarse cloth clothes without patches. She said, "The revolution has been victorious, and there are more things to do. What I have done is not enough. In the future, I plan to go to the factory to learn how to work. We must work hard to build after the victory."

　　艰苦奋斗二十三年
    ——记女共产党员王淑兰
    山乔
    大革命时期的老共产党员，毛泽民烈士的夫人王淑兰（毛泽民系毛主席的四弟，在新疆被国民党反动派杀害。），从一九二六年加入中国共产党起，二十三年来，一直在敌后坚持斗争，历尽了蒋匪帮的恐怖镇压和艰苦生活的磨练。当毛主席于初期革命活动中在家乡湘潭经常向贫苦农民宣传时，她受了毛主席的革命思想行动的影响，逐渐培养了革命的意识。她参加共产党后，就在家乡积极领导妇女解放运动。她到处开会宣传，号召妇女们起来反对封建压迫和剥削，并组织了妇女联合会，很快地发展会员九百多人。她成了湘潭县妇女解放运动的领袖之一。
    一九二七年“四一二”事变，蒋匪背叛革命，到处捕杀革命分子。王淑兰和其他五位共产党员也于同年五月十一日在长沙被捕入狱。被捕后，王淑兰始终表现了共产党员坚贞不屈的优秀品质，对敌人的威胁利诱毫不动摇。敌人曾以死刑来威吓她。一起被捕的人为她焦虑而流泪。但她却泰然地对和她一同入狱的人说：“共产党员只要死得光荣，死得伟大，就是最有价值的。敌人要杀我的时候，你们千万不能哭，哭只是表示自己的软弱。”等到一九三○年红军攻入长沙，她和其他被捕的同志就一起逃出了监狱。
    红军离长沙后，反动派又疯狂地捕杀革命分子。坚持湖南工作的共产党人很巧妙地退入地下活动，王淑兰因此失掉了党的关系。这曾给她以很大的苦恼。她为了躲避反动派的迫害，辗转往返于上海、武汉、长沙、湘潭等地。一九三七年，抗日战争爆发，她想：“女儿长大了，应该上前线。”她就设法托朋友将她唯一的女儿毛远志带到延安。临走前她谆谆嘱咐她女儿说：“到延安以后，一定要努力学习，服从工作需要，需要你背枪，你就背枪；需要你上前线时，你就上前线。”
    一九三八年，她终于在故乡韶山村恢复了党籍。她的工作任务是和另外一位共产党员在邵阳、临武一带建立秘密通讯站。那时她的生活极其艰苦，经常吃不饱，穿不暖。一个同志送她一件棉袄，她整整穿了五年，补钉都打满了。没有饭吃的时候，她就去沿门乞讨。她曾对同她工作的那位同志说：“共产党员不应计较生活，越艰苦就越能体会敌人的残酷，也就越要抓紧做工作。”以后，她利用废纸学会了剪裁衣服，帮别人作活，以维持生活。一九四六年秋天，她得了一次重病，当时没钱医治，几乎死去。虽然她经常处在受饥挨冻、贫病交迫的情况下，但她始终坚持工作，从不灰心丧气。她和同她工作的另一同志每隔十五天会面一次，检讨思想和工作，并互相勉励。她常说：“革命是有前途的，是光明的，伟大的。我监狱都坐过了，难道这些苦还不能忍受吗？”
    一九四七年秋天，她听到人民解放军胜利反攻的消息，这使她兴奋非常。从此他们的工作范围越发扩大了，除交通联络工作外，还深入群众，展开宣传教育。在上级党的指导下，他们又组织了一支游击队，她并亲自替游击队带路送信。
    湘南解放后，她的十年艰苦的交通联络工作始告结束。游击队把这位劳苦功高的革命老人接到部队里来。她今年已五十五岁了，但二十三年来，还是第一次过着这样安定的生活，第一次穿上没有补钉的新粗布衣服。她说：“革命胜利了，要作的事情更多。我所做的还很不够。今后我打算到工厂去学习做工，胜利了更得艰苦地建设。”
