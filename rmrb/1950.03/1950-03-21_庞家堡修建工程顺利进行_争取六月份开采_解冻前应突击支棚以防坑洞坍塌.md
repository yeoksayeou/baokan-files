　　Pangjiabao Construction Project Proceeds Smoothly; Strive for Mining in June; Shore Up Supports Before the Thaw to Prevent Cave-Ins
　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily on the 12th, the construction project at the Longyan Iron Mine's Pangjiabao mining area is proceeding smoothly. To strive for mining to begin in June of this year, with an annual output of 80,000 tons of ore, construction is currently being vigorously carried out. The construction work at the mine began on September 15th of last year and, as of February 25th of this year, considerable achievements have been made. The 15-kilometer road from Zhao Chuan to the mountaintop has been fully repaired. More than 200 new rooms have been built. Eighty-five percent of the old pits and tunnels have been repaired, and more than 500 supporting structures have been erected in the tunnels to further ensure the safety of workers. In terms of electromechanical aspects: a total of 17.5 kilometers of various lines have been erected, using more than 42,000 meters of wire, bringing light back to all the tunnels throughout the mountain. In addition, 21 water pumps, two 300-horsepower winches, 18 mine cars, 43 pneumatic drills, welding machines, and other miscellaneous items have been repaired. This year, except for the ore transportation road, which is not planned for repair, no other construction projects are expected to pose a problem. Currently, all employees are continuing to actively repair air compressors and various machine parts, laying ore transportation tracks, clearing accumulated water and waste rock from the tunnels, quarrying stone, and preparing for civil engineering work to begin in early April after the thaw, including building houses and installing running water pipes.
　　During the construction process, the workers' active efforts and the engineering and technical personnel's in-depth involvement in the tunnels and on-site, combined with the workers, are the main reasons for the smooth restoration of the project. When repairing the 300-horsepower winch in the eastern part, electromechanical worker Comrade Wei Guangfeng continued to work through the pain despite his hands being swollen with frostbite. Comrades in the water supply team, in order to repair the machines as soon as possible, generously took out their own shirts and new towels, tearing them up to wipe the motors. Zhang Wenzhong, a mining worker who previously had a relatively low level of awareness, has also transformed under the education of the trade union and the influence of everyone, and is now actively working and has been promoted to deputy production team leader. Engineers and technicians have also stepped out of the office, going deep into the tunnels to personally observe and provide technical guidance to the workers on supporting the tunnels. As a result, the tunnel repair tasks have been overfulfilled month after month.
　　The main problems existing in the construction of the mine, in addition to the need to quickly find ways to solve the railway transportation and power supply issues, are the urgent and immediate need to address the shoring up of supports and reinforcing of the tunnel entrances to prevent collapse after the thaw. There are no fewer than dozens of places where the tunnels have been in disrepair for many years and are on the verge of collapse. If immediate rescue measures are not taken, not only will previous efforts be wasted, but the subsequent restoration and mining will also be seriously affected. In addition, high attention should also be paid to workers' personal and environmental hygiene and food, which are related to workers' health. In February, the number of workers (especially on the night shift) who became ill due to eating cold food and drinking cold water increased compared to January, which is a serious problem. Currently, the mine's leadership is working with the Xuanhua Municipal Party Committee's work team to discuss appropriate solutions.

　　庞家堡修建工程顺利进行
    争取六月份开采
    解冻前应突击支棚以防坑洞坍塌
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报十二日消息：龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场，修建工程顺利进行。为争取今年六月开始采矿，年产矿八万吨，现正继续大力修建中。该矿的修建工作从去年九月十五日开始，至今年二月二十五日止，已获不少成绩。由赵川至山顶的十五公里公路已全部修复。新房修建起二百余间。旧有坑洞、隧道已修复百分之八十五，并在坑道中支棚棚子五百余架，使工人安全有了进一步的保障。在机电方面：共架各种线十七公里半，用线四万二千余米，使全山各坑道已重放光明。另修好水泵二十一部，三百马力绞车两部，矿车十八部，风钻四十三部，焊子机及其他零活等。今年除尚线运矿路不准备修复外，其他各项修建工程预计均不成问题。现全体职工正继续积极装修压风机与各种机件，铺修运矿道，清除坑巷积水废石开山取石，准备四月初解冻后，即开始土木工程，修建房舍，安装自来水管等。
    在修建过程中，工人的积极努力及工程技术人员深入坑道、现场，与工人相结合，是使工程顺利修复的主要原因。修理东部三百马力绞车时，机电工魏光丰同志，把手冻肿了还咬着牙干。水道组同志为早日修复机器，毫不吝惜地将自己的衬衣、新毛巾拿出，撕碎擦马达。一向觉悟性较差的采矿工张文中，也在工会教育及大家影响下转变过来，积极努力，现已被提为生产副组长。工程师、技术员也走出了办公室，深入坑道亲自观察，从技术上指导工人棚棚子。因此坑道修复任务月月超过完成。
    该场修建中存在的主要问题，除铁路交通、电源供应等应速设法解决外，当前刻不容缓、急需马上着手进行者，则是坑内、洞口的支棚、打旋，以防解冻坍塌。因坑道年久失修，眼看即将坍塌者不下数十处，如不立予急救，不但前功尽弃，并将严重影响到日后的修复、开采。此外对工人的个人、环境卫生及伙食等有关工人健康问题，亦应提起高度注意。二月份工人（尤其是夜班）因吃凉饭、喝冷水而闹病者，较一月份增多，这是个严重问题。现该场领导上正协同宣化市委工作组，研讨妥善解决中。
