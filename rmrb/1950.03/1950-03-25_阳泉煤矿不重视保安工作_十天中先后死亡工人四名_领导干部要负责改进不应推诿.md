(Reported by reporter Lin Li) The Yangquan State-owned Coal Mine suffered the unfortunate deaths of four workers in the ten days from March 4th to March 14th. These unfortunate incidents were mainly caused by the mine's neglect of safety work. In the Yugong Mine, affiliated with the Mining Bureau, a rock fall on March 4th crushed and killed masonry worker Kong Xinyuan. On the 9th, tunneling worker Xu Guangshun mistakenly entered the Five Lanes, where methane gas had been detected a month earlier, igniting the gas and dying from burns. On the morning of the 12th, Wang Miaoxiao, a recovery worker at the Fourth Mine, was struck in the waist by a piece of coal weighing over 800 pounds, and died that evening after treatment proved ineffective. On the morning of the 14th, loader Liu Yingchun was hit by a train on his way to work, his legs were crushed, and he died from head injuries. Some of these four workers met their deaths due to their own carelessness (such as Liu Yingchun), but the main reason was that the mine was very negligent in its safety work. For example, methane gas was discovered in the Yugong Mine a month earlier, and it should have been immediately ventilated and evacuated, or the passages blocked to prevent people from mistakenly entering. However, none of these necessary measures were taken, only a "No Entry" sign was hung at the entrance of the lane. Before Wang Miaoxiao and Kong Xinyuan met their deaths, workers reported the situation of "possible danger" to the security personnel, but they ignored it. What is especially intolerable is the behavior of Xu Xinwen, the team leader in charge of contracting. When workers reported to him that there were cracking sounds from the roof of the mine, he heartlessly said: "If you get hurt, the public has a hospital, if you get crushed to death, they'll give you a coffin, I earn wages, I don't care about that." Some safety workers do not reflect on this serious phenomenon. In their written reports to the Mining Bureau, they almost all wrote: "Due to personal carelessness, died on duty." According to Bureau Chief Bai Youzhi, they emphasized "personal carelessness" to push the responsibility onto the dead. Even more absurd is the claim of some administrative heads, who say that too much emphasis has been placed on "safety first," and that safety personnel are afraid of being punished and dare not work. Their reason is: "Once an accident occurs, safety workers do not distinguish responsibility, and first ask for punishment..." On March 11th, the reporter went to the Yugong Mine and witnessed Deputy Mine Director Zhang Hongzhen complaining that the trade union workers did not do enough to educate the workers, while the trade union workers blamed the administration for not paying attention to safety work. They shirk responsibility by blaming each other. The reporter believes that this is not a serious and responsible attitude towards the lives of workers, and it is not because "safety first" is emphasized too much, but because it is emphasized too little, or only mentioned in words. It is hoped that the person in charge of the mine will not be blinded by some irresponsible clamoring, and should, according to the current actual situation, further implement the education of "safety first," and seriously come up with some practical and effective methods to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents.

　　阳泉煤矿不重视保安工作
    十天中先后死亡工人四名
    领导干部要负责改进不应推诿
    【本报讯】记者林里报道：阳泉国营煤矿从三月四日到十四日的十天中，先后发生死亡工人四名的不幸事件。这些不幸事件主要是因为该矿不重视保安工作而引起的。该矿矿务局所属裕公矿，三月四日因顶石下落，砸死砌?工人孔辛元。九日掘进工人徐光顺，误入早于月前就发现了瓦斯的五道巷，燃着瓦斯，烧伤而死。十二日上午，第四矿回采工王妙小被一块八百多斤重的梆煤打在腰部，诊治无效当晚身死。十四日早晨，装车工人刘映春于上班途中，被火车撞倒，轧断两腿、摔伤头部而亡。这四位工友有的是因为本人不慎（如刘映春）而遇难，但主要原因，是该矿十分疏忽保安工作。如裕公矿早于月前就发现了瓦斯，理应立即通风疏散，或堵塞通口免人误入。但是，这些必要的措施全没有做，只在巷口挂了一个“禁止通行”的牌子。王妙小、孔辛元遇难前，均有工人向保安人员报告“恐出危险”的情况，然而他们不加理睬。尤其不能容忍的是包车大组长徐新文。当工人向他报告窑顶有劈拍声的情况时，他竟毫无心肝地说：“碰伤了公家有医院，砸死了发棺材，我赚的是工钱，管不着那回事。”一些保安工作者对这种严重现象不做检讨，他们在给矿务局的书面报告中，几乎都写着：“本人不慎，因公而亡”。据该局局长白犹之谈：他们强调“本人不慎”是想把责任推到死人身上了事。更荒谬的是某些行政负责人，他们竟说保安第一喊得太多了，保安人员怕判罪而不敢工作了。他们的理由是：“一出事故，保安工作者不分责任，首先自请处分……”三月十一日记者至裕公矿，目睹张鸿珍副矿长埋怨工会工作者对工人教育不够，工会工作者则责备行政上不注意保安工作。他们在相互埋怨中推诿责任。记者认为这不是对工人生命严肃负责的态度，更不是因为保安第一喊得太多，而是喊得太少，或只喊工作。希望该矿负责人不要为一些不负责的叫嚷所蒙蔽，应根据当前实际情况，进一步贯彻保安第一的教育，认真想出一些切实有效的办法，防止类似事件的发生。
