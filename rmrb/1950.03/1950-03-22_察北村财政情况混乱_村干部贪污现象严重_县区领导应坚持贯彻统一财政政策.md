According to the Chahar Daily News on March 19th: The method of unified revenue and expenditure for village finances has been implemented for nearly a year, but many counties in the Chabei Special District have not yet implemented it at the village level. There is rampant arbitrary apportionment and extremely serious corruption and waste at the village level. Incomplete statistics from Kui Daotai Village, Shangyi County, Shuiqu Village, Shangdu County, and Wujiawan and Xiaoheishatu Villages, Huade County alone show that last year, village cadres embezzled and wasted more than 20,530 jin of grain including millet, wheat, and naked oats, greatly increasing the burden on the masses. In Shuiqu Village, with 137 households and 67 qing of land, each mu was burdened with an average of more than half a jin of millet in addition to the public grain and local grain that should have been borne last year. Kui Daotai Village illegally apportioned five times from January to October last year, collecting 114 shi and four dou of naked oats, which were spent completely illegally. Paper cigarettes alone were purchased 27 articles and eight boxes, expending 23 shi of naked oats. Village cadres expensed meal fees in the village when they went to the district for meetings, to natural villages for meetings, and when primary school teachers helped with work; they tried to embezzle everywhere when collecting public grain and local grain, distributing preferential treatment grain for military families, and receiving village funds. In Yangjiayingzi Village, Dahulun District, Zhangbei County, one shi and five dou of preferential treatment grain for military families were received from the district, but only five sheng were distributed, and the rest was all embezzled. Some primary school teachers in the village also muddied the waters and grabbed a handful. A primary school teacher in Da Gonsi Village, Shangdu County, forcibly demanded "comfort" of two da shi of naked oats from the masses. Zhao Yunchuan, a primary school teacher in Erhuofang Village, had the village cultivate 50 mu of land for him. In short, in the counties of the Chabei New District, the legacy of corruption, waste, and extortion by "village office personnel" during the enemy and puppet regime is still relatively common and serious. Some county and district cadres turn a blind eye to this, even thinking that "it's nothing for village cadres to eat and drink a little." They are indifferent to such major issues related to the suffering of the people and the construction of production. More seriously, some district cadres also muddied the waters and took petty advantages. Last November, the Huade Fifth District Office bought four dog skins from Baiyin Erji Village for only 3,000 yuan each. As a result, the village subsidized the price at eight dou of naked oats per skin. Tangjiayingzi Village, Baoyuan, gave gifts to the district twice last year during the Mid-Autumn Festival and the New Year, spending a total of six shi, eight dou, and five sheng of naked oats. This gave village cadres more opportunities to embezzle and waste. The county and special commissioner's leadership have also failed to attach importance to this ideologically and conduct timely and in-depth inspections. The finance department has no one specifically responsible for village finances. The unified revenue and expenditure work of village funds is only limited to the administrative procedures of collection and distribution; publicity and education to the masses is insufficient, and the masses have not been mobilized as the foundation of the unified system. Therefore, after the implementation of the unified revenue and expenditure system for village funds, some places not only did not reduce the burden on the masses but increased it, because after the masses paid the local grain, although the county issued funds to each village every month, the village cadres still apportioned as usual. These serious chaotic phenomena have been somewhat changed since the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office held a meeting of county finance section chiefs last December. Some counties have begun to rectify, but it is still far from enough. Leaders at all levels in Chabei should still strengthen this work.

### 察北村财政情况混乱  村干部贪污现象严重  县区领导应坚持贯彻统一财政政策

　　察北村财政情况混乱  村干部贪污现象严重
    县区领导应坚持贯彻统一财政政策
    【本报讯】据三月十九日察哈尔日报消息：村财政实行统筹统支办法将近一年，察北专区不少县份仍未贯彻到村，村里乱摊乱派，贪污浪费现象极其严重。仅据尚义县奎道台村，商都水渠村和化德武家湾，小黑沙土四村不完整的统计：去年村干贪污、浪费小米、小麦、莜麦等粮两万零五百三十余斤，大大加重了群众负担。水渠村一百三十七户，六十七顷地，去年除应负担的公粮、地方粮外，每亩平均又增加了小米半斤多。奎道台村去年一至十月份非法摊派了五次，敛莜麦一百一十四大石四斗，完全非法开支。仅纸烟一项即买了二十七条零八盒，开支莜麦二十三大石。村干部到区开会，到自然村开会，小学教员帮助工作，都要在村里开支饭费；征收公粮、地方粮，发放优军粮，领村经费，处处都要设法贪污。张北县大囫囵区杨家营子村，从区领回优军粮一石五斗，只发了五升，其余全部贪污。有些村的小学教员，也混水摸鱼，乱抓一把。商都县大公司村小学教员，硬向群众要“慰劳”莜麦两大石。二伙房村小学教员赵云川，让村给代耕五十亩地。总之，在察北新区的县份里，敌伪统治时“村办公人员”贪污、浪费、横征暴敛的遗毒还较普遍而严重地存在着。有些县、区干部，对此视若无睹，甚至认为“村干部吃点喝点不算什么。”对这样有关人民苦痛及生产建设的大事漠不关心。更严重的是某些区干部也混水摸鱼，占小便宜。化德五区区公所去年十一月从白银耳基村买狗皮四张，每张只给了三千元，结果村里按每张八斗莜麦贴了价。宝源唐家营子村去年中秋节、年节两次都给区里送礼，共花莜麦六石八斗五升。这就多给了村干贪污浪费的机会。县、专署领导上对此也没有从思想上重视起来，进行及时深入地检查。财政部门对村财政没有专人负责。村经费统筹统支工作只停留在征收与分发的事务手续上；对群众宣传教育不够，没有把群众发动起来，作为统筹制度的基础。因此，村经费统筹统支制度实行后，有些地方不但没有减轻反而加重了群众负担，因为群众交纳了地方粮以后，县里虽每月给各村照发经费，但村干部还是照旧地摊派。这些严重的混乱现象，在察北专署去年十二月各县财政科长会议以后，已有所转变，有些县已开始整理，但还很不够，察北各级领导仍应加强这一工作。
