　　Restoring the National Economy and the "Old Renewed" Method
    ·Chen Jiakang·
    After we visited Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland and other People's Democratic countries, as well as the economic construction of the Soviet Union, in the second half of 1949, several comrades simultaneously discovered a method in the work of restoring the national economy, which can be called the "old renewed" method.
    What is "old renewed"? It means using the old foundation to rebuild new buildings, using old materials to create new things. Since the revolution has taken place, since victory has been achieved, why not build everything completely new? Why "take a step back" and engage in "old renewed"? This is not a step back, but a step forward. Because after a great revolution, after a great war, the entire social property and wealth will inevitably be destroyed and wasted, and large-scale new construction cannot be carried out immediately. According to the historical law of production and construction, a recovery phase is usually required. For example, after the end of foreign armed intervention and the civil war in the Soviet Union in 1920, it was not followed by large-scale national industrialization, but a transition to the peaceful work of restoring the national economy (1921-1925). Another example is the new five-year plan (1946-1950) implemented by the Soviet Union after the Second World War, which was called the Five-Year Plan for the Restoration and Development of the National Economy. During the period of restoring the national economy, both manpower and material resources are still insufficient. The old property and old wealth in front of us, although destroyed and wasted, can still be used. Therefore, a method of "old renewed" is devised to catch a breath and accumulate material strength. At this historical juncture, being overly ambitious often leads to mistakes.
    We first visited Warsaw. The restoration of Warsaw was done using the "old renewed" method. Polish comrades told us that this method was learned from the Soviet Union. Later, we visited Stalingrad, and indeed, the "old renewed" method was used. For example, a large building, with half of it destroyed, can be repaired and transformed, and it will still be useful. Even if it is completely destroyed, leaving only a foundation, this foundation should be used, because a foundation can often save a large amount of construction costs. We visited the Red October Tractor Factory in Stalingrad. This factory experienced fierce battles, was subjected to artillery fire and bombing, and was occupied by the German army. Most of the factory buildings collapsed, and most of the machines were damaged. After the liberation of Stalingrad, Soviet comrades used the "old renewed" method to restore the factory in three months, and its output now exceeds that before the war. In Warsaw, we also saw a method of "old renewed." Houses were destroyed, and the streets were full of bricks and tiles. Even transporting this pile of waste materials would require a large amount of funds. Polish comrades came up with a solution: first use a machine to grind these bricks on the spot, and then use a brick-making machine to manufacture new bricks from these old materials, which are both strong and durable.
    The "old renewed" method can be used not only to restore destruction and heal war wounds, but also in general restoration and construction work. For example, we visited a ten-year middle school in Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Its school building was an old building that was used as a cavalry stable by the German invaders. The best university in the Soviet Union, Moscow University, still uses the building of its founder Lomonosov, plus additional buildings. It is not as beautiful as Tsinghua and Wuhan Universities. There are tens of thousands of students, and until recently, it was too crowded, so they started adding new school buildings.
    This is of course not to say that everything in the Soviet Union is "old renewed" and there is no completely new construction. The Soviet Union has plenty of completely new buildings, new roads, new factories, and new mines. I am just saying that the Soviet Union generally adopted the "old renewed" method during the period of restoring the national economy from 1921 to 1925, and even at that time, there was still some completely new construction. Today, the Soviet Union mainly adopts the policy of completely new construction, but under certain conditions, it still does not abandon the "old renewed" method. The Soviet Union first had old machines, then new machines. Today, we can still see new and old machines being used together in Soviet factories. The Soviet Union first used old carriages, then new carriages. Today, we can still see new and old carriages being used together on Soviet railways. The Soviet Union first had old ships, then new ships. Today, we can still see new and old ships being used together on Soviet rivers. In people's daily lives, there were first old houses, then new houses. We see new and old houses being used together. First there was old furniture, then new furniture. We see new and old furniture being used together. In a word, "old renewed" is the most effective transitional method.
    There is also a special situation where the "old renewed" method must be adopted. This is to preserve the historical and cultural traditions. For example, the construction of Moscow is "old renewed." The ancient Kremlin, the ancient buildings, and the ancient churches, which are related to the Russian national cultural traditions, have all been preserved. Why preserve these things? Why not tear them down completely? Don't these things represent feudal rule? Weren't these things built by the Tsar? Yes, these were built by the Tsar, but the Tsar didn't do it himself; they were still built by the working people. These things represent feudal rule on the one hand, and the fruits of labor of the people on the other. Now the Tsar's autocracy has long been overthrown. The fruits of labor of the people are still taken back by the people and preserved as a permanent memorial!
    Not only material resources can be "old renewed," but also talents. In fact, talent is also a kind of material force. In the Soviet Union, Pavlov and Michurin are typical examples of the "old renewed" of talents. Today, we see that the Soviet Union's new talents, new experts, and new intellectuals have been cultivated. At the same time, we also see that the transformed old talents, old experts, and old intellectuals are still old but vigorous, working hard together with the new talents, new experts, and new intellectuals.
    I remember during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Tao Xingzhi in Chongqing was worried about oil, salt, firewood, and rice every day, and he also planned to run Yucai School and the Social University. The tighter the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang oppressed him, the more excited he became. While talking, he found a bombed-out house in the city, simply repaired it, and found several houses in Beibei. So Yucai School and the Social University were established. Mr. Tao used the "old renewed" method throughout his life in running Xiaozhuang Normal School and the Shanghai Gongxue Troupe, which shows that financial difficulties cannot kill those who can truly do things.
    Our Chinese proletariat's revolutionary ranks, in Jiangxi, in Yan'an, and in various liberated areas, have all adopted the "old renewed" method. But it was during the war, not during peaceful construction. Based on the experience of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the "old renewed" method must still be temporarily adopted during the period of peaceful construction. At the beginning of the founding of our People's Republic of China, there were financial difficulties and funding difficulties. However, as long as we do not plan too much, and do not implement tomorrow's or even the day after tomorrow's plans ahead of schedule today, then, using the old foundation can indeed rebuild new buildings, and using old materials can indeed create new things. And it can indeed win the victory of restoring and developing the national economy.

### 恢复国民经济与旧翻新办法

　　恢复国民经济与旧翻新办法
    ·陈家康·
    当我们于一九四九年下半年先后参观过匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、捷克斯拉夫、波兰等人民民主国家，以及苏联的经济建设之后，几个同志同时发现在国民经济恢复工作中有一种办法，可以叫做旧翻新办法。
    什么叫旧翻新呢？就是利用旧基础，翻造新建筑，利用旧材料，翻造新事物。既然革命了，既然胜利了，为什么不样样来它一个全新建设，竟作“退一步”之想，来搞旧翻新呢？这不是退一步，这正是进一步。因为在一次大革命之后，在一次大战争之后，整个社会财产和财富，必然遭受破坏和荒废，而不能立即举办大规模的全新建设。按照生产建设的历史规律，通常都需要一个恢复阶段。例如苏联在一九二○年外国武装干涉和国内战争结束之后，接着并不是大规模的国家工业化，而是过渡到恢复国民经济的和平工作时期（一九二一至一九二五年）。又例如苏联在第二次世界战争之后所进行的新五年计划（一九四六至一九五○年）就叫做恢复和发展国民经济的五年计划。而在恢复国民经济时期，人力物力，两样仍感不足。摆在面前的旧财产，旧财富，虽然遭受破坏和荒废，又仍然可以利用，于是想出一条旧翻新办法，以便喘过一口气来，以便积蓄物质力量。在这个历史关键上，好大喜功，每每误事。
    我们先参观华沙，华沙的恢复是用旧翻新办法。波兰同志告诉我们，这种办法是从苏联学来的。后来我们参观斯大林格勒，果然用的是旧翻新办法。譬如一所大建筑，打掉了半截，修复起来，改造一下，仍然顶用。即令全部打垮了，只剩下一个地基，也应利用这块地基，因为一块地基，每每可以节省一大笔建筑费。我们参观过斯大林格勒红十月拖拉机制造厂。这个工厂经过了残酷的争夺战，遭受过炮火轰炸，德军占领，最大部分厂房坍塌了，最大多数机器残坏了。斯大林格勒解放之后，苏联同志就用旧翻新的办法，把这个工厂在三个月内恢复起来，现在出产量超过战前。在华沙，我们还看见过一种旧翻新的办法。房屋破坏了，条条街都是砖头瓦块。连搬运这堆废料，都需要一大笔经费。波兰同志想出一条办法，先用一副机器当场将这些砖头磨碎，然后用一副制砖机将这些旧材料制造新砖，又结实，又耐用。
    旧翻新办法，不仅在恢复破坏、医治战争创伤方面可以使用，在一般恢复建设工作中，同样可以使用。例如我们在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国首都基也夫（即基辅）参观过一个十年制中学，其校舍就是一座旧建筑，德寇占领时，曾用为骑兵马厩。苏联最好的学府——莫斯科大学，仍然是利用其创办人罗曼诺索夫当时的建筑，加上添补的建筑，并不及清华和武汉等大学优美，现有成万学生，直到最近，实在拥挤不开，才着手添修新校舍。
    这当然不是说在苏联一切都是旧翻新，而没有全新建设。苏联有的是全新建筑，全新道路，全新工厂，全新矿场。我只是说苏联在一九二一至一九二五年国民经济恢复时期一般采用旧翻新办法，而且，即使在当时，也并非没有全新建设。今天苏联主要采取全新建设方针，然而在一定条件下，仍不放弃旧翻新办法。苏联先有旧机器，后有新机器，今天我们在苏联工厂中还可看见新旧机器同时并用。苏联先用旧车厢，后有新车厢，今天我们在苏联铁路上，仍可看见新旧车厢同时并用。苏联先有旧船舶，后有新船舶，今天我们在苏联河道上，仍可看见新旧船舶同时并用。在人民日常生活中，先有旧房屋，后有新房屋，我们看见新旧房屋同时并用。先有旧家具，后有新家具，我们看见新旧家具同时并用。总而言之一句话，旧翻新是一种最能奏效的过渡办法。
    还有一种特殊情况，也非采用旧翻新的办法不可。这就是为了保留历史文化传统。例如莫斯科市的建设，便是旧翻新。古老的克里姆宫，古老的建筑，古老的教堂，有关俄罗斯民族文化传统的，都保留下来了。为什么要保留这些东西呢？为什么不完全拆掉呢？难道这些东西不是表示封建统治吗？难道这些东西不是沙皇叫做的吗？不错，这是沙皇叫做的，然而这不是沙皇亲手做的，这仍然是劳动人民亲手做的。这些东西一方面表示封建统治，另一方面还表示人民群众的劳动果实。现在沙皇专制老早打倒了。人民群众的劳动果实仍然由人民群众收回，保留下来，做个永远的纪念吧！
    不仅物力可以旧翻新，人才同样可以旧翻新。实际上，人才也是一种物质力量。在苏联，巴甫洛夫、米邱林就是人才旧翻新的典型例子。今天，我们看见苏联的新人才，新专家，新知识分子都培养起来了。同时，我们还看见改造过了的旧人才，旧专家和旧知识分子，仍然老当益壮，与新人才，新专家，新知识分子在一道，共同努力。
    记得抗战期间，陶行知先生在重庆每天为油盐柴米发愁，还要计划办育才学校，办社会大学，国民党反动统治压迫越紧，他越兴致勃勃。说着说着，他在城内找着一座炸塌了的大房子，简单修理一下，又在北碚找着几幢屋子，于是育才学校、社会大学都办起来了。陶先生平生办晓庄师范，办上海工学团，一贯都用旧翻新办法，足见经费困难究竟困不死真能办事的人。
    我们中国无产阶级的革命队伍，在江西，在延安，在各解放区，都采用过旧翻新的办法。但都是战争时期，不是和平建设时间。证之苏联和东欧人民民主国家的经验，在和平建设时期，仍得暂时采用旧翻新办法。我们中华人民共和国成立之初，财政是有困难的，经费是有困难的。然而，只要我们不失之于计划太大，不把明天的甚至后天的方案提早到今天实行，那么，利用旧基础，的确能翻造出新建筑，利用旧材料，的确能翻造出新事物。也就的确能争取恢复和发展国民经济工作的胜利。
