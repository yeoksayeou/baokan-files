　　Major Inspection Conducted on Beijing-Suiyuan Railway
    Serious Embezzlement and Waste Discovered; Frequent Accidents Due to Negligence
    Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau Conducting Supervision and Handling

　　[Special Dispatch from our newspaper] Our reporter Li Yi reports: Serious embezzlement, waste, smuggling, and accidents due to negligence have recently been discovered on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. These phenomena have attracted the attention of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, which dispatched sixty-six on-duty cadres on January 15th to conduct a major work inspection in the Nankou, Zhangjiakou, and Datong sections of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. According to preliminary inspection reports, in the sections of the Beijing-Suiyuan line inspected by the inspectors, from Nankou to Jining, a distance of approximately 500 kilometers, there exists considerable embezzlement, smuggling, waste, and many preventable accidents due to negligence. According to a report from the Zhangjiakou inspection team, among the twenty-four employees of the Zhangjiakou Transportation Section who frequently travel with the trains and have been interviewed, none were not involved in smuggling silver, opium, acetic acid (used to make the narcotic heroin) during the first half of last year. A train attendant named Wang Jinliang engaged in smuggling on every trip. After the launch of the production and savings campaign on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway in July last year, smuggling decreased but was not eradicated. Most noteworthy is that these employees secretly contacted each other along the route and colluded with private merchants. Take the attendant Lu Dongyuan as an example. Based in Zhangjiakou, Lu frequently traveled between Beijing and Datong, transporting opium and silver dollars from Datong, Yanggao, Zhangjiakou, and other places to Beijing, and heroin and acetic acid from Beijing back to those places. His partners were distributed in Datong, Yanggao, Tianzhen, Chaigoubu, Zhangjiakou, Beijing, and other places, totaling nineteen people. Last year, the total number of smuggled goods was 405 taels of opium and heroin, 51 pounds of acetic acid, and 755 silver dollars.

    While smuggling existed, so did embezzlement and theft. Among the twenty-two employees of the Zhangjiakou Transportation Section who had undergone self-criticism, eleven had stolen goods from trains, ranging from food and cloth to cement, and as small as eggs and eggplants. Yu Dazhen and Liang Zhongcai, clerks at Luowenzao Station, even sold two bags of sorghum lost by the train for their own gain.

            Some Employees Engage in Smuggling, Colluding with Private Merchants to Enrich Themselves at Public Expense

    In Fengzhen and Jining Stations, in the Suiyuan area of the western section of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, embezzlement, smuggling, and dereliction of duty can be said to have reached their peak. Su Fuyi, the stationmaster of Jining Station, joined the private-run Dacheng Freight Yard as a "labor shareholder." After the lifting of the plague blockade in November last year, a large number of carload shipments accumulated at the station, but Su Fuyi privately agreed with Dacheng Freight Yard to accept the yard's less-than-carload shipments in stages and stations. Dacheng Freight Yard charged less-than-carload merchants less-than-carload freight rates (which at the time were about twice as high as carload freight rates) but shipped the goods as carload due to collusion with stationmaster Su Fuyi. Su Fuyi thus obtained "gifts" such as heroin, mooncakes, and fruit from Dacheng Freight Yard. At Fengzhen Station, freight clerk Su Peiyuan used his work to monopolize and exploit private merchants through the Heji Freight Yard opened by his father. When Heji Freight Yard shipped goods, invoices could be obtained without seeing the goods, and only a few of the lightest pieces were weighed. According to regulations, items over ten kilograms should be advanced for calculation, but the freight clerk erased the number 73 kilograms. This is a supreme manifestation of embezzling for personal gain, and the form it takes is more concealed and not easily detected for a while.

    At Luowenzao Station, eight out of ten employees in the entire station were involved with local prostitutes, and gambling was frequent in the station, with prostitutes accompanying them. Switchman Zhang Qinglong caused the train to stop outside the station because he participated in gambling during his shift. The ticket seller slept on duty, making it impossible for passengers to buy tickets and board the train. Peasants' sheep that ran into the station were slaughtered by employees. Merchants loading and unloading goods at the station often had to pay two fees, one to the station and one to the loading and unloading team. In December alone last year, the six loading and unloading workers at the station earned a total of more than 2 million RMB.

    All of the above is not the style that employees of the people's railway should have. The people's railway absolutely does not allow such bad and illegal behavior to exist. The Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, in view of its serious damage to the transportation cause of the people's motherland, has given these derelict employees the punishment they deserve.

            Negligence by a Few Employees Leads to Serious Loss of Assets

    In the past year, there were a total of 448 traffic accidents in the Nankou and Zhangjiakou sections, with a total loss of more than 250,000 jin of millet. Among them, in the 229 accidents in the Nankou section alone, 38 were man-made and therefore completely avoidable accidents. In the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, in the past year, losses caused by collisions and vehicle conflicts within the depot and broken couplers due to the carelessness of a few employees accounted for more than 60% of the total value of the 219 accidents. On August 8th last year, driver Hao Wenbin was driving train 445 from Chaigoubu towards Datong. Before the train entered the main line in the station, he failed to look back frequently and was negligent for a moment, causing the 25th and 26th cars of the train to derail and overturn, causing casualties. On May 5th last year, a driver from the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot drove from Kangzhuang towards Zhangjiakou. When passing the Xuanhua water supply station, he did not personally measure the water in the water tank, but only let the fireman take a casual look and thought that there was enough water, so he did not add water. As a result, the train stopped at Ningyuan Station, 15 li away from Zhangjiakou, because the water was used up.

            Long Train Stop Times at Stations Cause Low Turnover Rates for Freight Cars

    From January 1st to 15th of this year, Zhangjiakou Station on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway sent a total of 1,513 empty and loaded freight cars, including 1,277 carload shipments. According to the bureau's regulations, each car exceeded the transfer time by 1.7 hours. There were 236 less-than-carload freight cars, and according to the bureau's regulations, each car exceeded 19 hours. The two items totaled more than 6,654 hours. Calculated at 100 jin of millet per car hour, the total waste of millet due to the extended stay of freight cars in transit at the station in half a month was 665,400 jin. The reason for the excessive stop time is objectively due to the fact that the station has fewer loaders and lower work efficiency, but the main reason is that the leaders of the station have adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the stopped vehicles. The stationmaster said in his self-criticism: "If there is no accumulation of goods in the freight yard and no accidents occur in the station, my responsibility is fulfilled, and the stop time has nothing to do with me." What a muddled concept! Little does he know that extending the stay of freight cars will, on the contrary, reduce the turnover rate of freight cars, increase transportation costs, and, most importantly, at a time when the national railway vehicles are still in short supply, many important materials cannot be transported in time due to the lack of vehicles, but Zhangjiakou Station has lost more than 6,000 car hours in half a month due to the irresponsibility of the leadership. How much condemnation should this receive from the people!

            Nankou Station Neglects Traffic Safety; Most Turnouts Do Not Meet Standards

    After inspecting 94 turnouts at Nankou Station, the Nankou inspection team found that only four met the standards set by the section itself. One hundred and seven places had shallow wheel flange grooves on the turnout side lines. The connecting rod of the No. 2 turnout in the materials factory was detached from the switch rail, and the opening width of the switch rail was as wide as 180 mm in some places and as narrow as not being able to pass a car in others. The lack of materials is certainly one reason, but the negligence of the leaders of Nankou Station regarding traffic safety is also intolerable. From July 4th to November 9th last year, traffic accidents occurring on turnouts within Nankou Station reached as many as eleven times.

    The major inspection campaign on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway is still ongoing, and the problems discovered are being resolved one by one. Zhu Yunsheng, the Deputy Director of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, has already departed to various stations to implement specific supervision.

　　京绥铁路进行大检查
    发现严重贪污浪费  责任事故屡次发生
    张家口铁路分局正予督导处理
    【本报特讯】本报记者李翼报导：京绥铁路最近发现了严重的贪污、浪费、走私现象及责任事故。这些现象已引起张家口铁路分局的注意，并已于一月十五日起抽调了六十六名在职干部，分赴京绥路南口、张家口、大同三段，举行工作大检查。根据初步检查报告，在检查者走过的自南口至集宁约五百公里的京绥线部分车站中，存在着相当严重的贪污、走私、浪费及完全可以避免的许多责任事故。据张家口检查组报告，该组与张家口车务段已经进行过谈话的二十四名经常随车出动的员工，在去年上半年，无一不从事白银、烟土、醋酸（制毒品白面用）等走私活动。一名王金亮之列车服务员，每次出动，均行走私。去年七月京绥路开展生产节约运动之后，走私现象减少，但并未根绝。最值得注意的，是这些员工在沿线暗中互相联络，且与私商勾结。以服务员卢东源为例，卢以张家口为基点，经常来往于北京、大同之间，由大同、阳高、张家口等地带往北京的是烟土、白洋，由北京带回的是白面、醋酸，与其合伙者分布于大同、阳高、天镇、柴沟堡、张家口、北京等地，共十九人，去年走私总数，计烟土、白面四百零五两，醋酸五十一磅，白洋七百五十五元。
    与走私同时存在的，是贪污和偷窃事件。张家口车务段已做过反省的二十二个员工中，有十一名偷过列车上的货物，大至食粮、布匹、洋灰，小至鸡蛋、茄子。罗文皂车站职员于大真、梁重才，竟将列车遗失之两袋高粱，出卖肥己。
            部分员工从事走私  勾结私商假公肥己
    在京绥路西段绥远境内之丰镇、集宁两车站，贪污、走私、渎职事件，可以说是发展到了顶点。集宁车站站长苏傅义，以“人力股”加入私营达成货栈。去年十一月防鼠疫封锁解除后，整车货物聚集于该车站者极多，而苏傅义却与达成货栈私订了分期分站承受该栈的零担货物。达成货栈以零担运费收运零担商之货物（零担运费当时约高于整车货运费一倍），却因与站长苏傅义相勾结而以整车托运。苏傅义从而由达成货栈方面获得了白面、月饼、水果等“礼物”。在丰镇车站，货物员苏培元，借其工作之便，与其父开设之和记货栈，垄断、剥削私商。和记货栈发货，不见货可以得到发票，许多货品中，只抽几件份量最低的过磅。按规章，十公斤以上者应提进计算，但该货物员却将七十三公斤的数字抹掉，这是贪污肥己的一种最高表现，其所采取的形式较为隐蔽，且一时不易发觉。
    在罗文皂车站，全站员工十分之八与当地野妓为伍，站内经常聚赌，聚赌时还要野妓陪伴。转辙员张庆隆，因当班期间参与赌博，致使列车停止于站外。售票员当班睡觉，使旅客无法买票上车。农民的羊跑入车站，竟被员工宰杀。客商在该站装卸货物，经常要出两份钱，一份给站方，一份给装卸队。单去年十二月份，该站六个装卸工，即共得人民币二百余万元。
    以上这一切，均不是人民铁路的员工应有的作风，人民的铁路是绝不允许这种恶劣的非法行为存在的。张家口铁路分局鉴于其对人民祖国交通事业的严重破坏性，业已给予这些渎职的员工以应受的处罚。
            少数员工疏忽大意  招致资财严重损失
    去年一年中，南口、张家口两段行车事故共四百四十八件，损失总值在二十五万斤小米以上，其中单南口段二百二十九件事故中，人为的因而是完全可以避免的事故占三十八次。张家口机务段，去年年一年内，因少数员工疏忽大意，而招致的段内机车冲撞，车辆冲突，车钩破损等损失，占全部事故二百十九次损失总值的百分之六十以上。司机郝文斌，去年八月八日，开四四五次车由柴沟堡向大同方面行驶，车在站内驶入正线之前，未能频频回顾，一时疏忽，致列车之第二十五、六辆车脱线颠覆，造成人员死伤。去年五月五日，张家口机务段一司机，由康庄方面开车至张家口，过宣化给水站时，自己未亲眼测量水柜存水，只由司炉随便一看，以为水还够，即未上水，至距张家口十五华里之宁远车站，因水用完，而告停车。
            站上停车时间长  货车周转率降低
    本年一月一日至十五日，京绥路张家口车站共发送空重货车一千五百十三辆，其中整车一千二百七十七辆，照局方规定之中转时间，每车超过一点七小时。零担货车二百三十六辆，照局方规定，每车超过十九小时。两项合计共超过六千六百五十四小时，每一车小时以一百斤小米计算，半个月内因货车中转留站时间延长，总共浪费小米为六十六万五千四百斤。停车时间过长的原因，客观上是由于该站装卸工较少，工作效率低，而主要的是因为该站的领导人对于停站车辆采取了一种不负责任的态度。该站站长反省时说：“货场不积货，站内不出事故，我的责任就尽到了，停车时间与我无关”。这是多么糊涂的观念啊！殊不知，由于货车留站时间的延长，相反的会使货车周转率降低，运输成本增高，而最重要的是当此全国铁路车辆尚不敷使用之时，许多重要物资因车的缺乏不能及时输送，而张家口车站却因为领导上的不负责任，在半个月内即损失了六千多个车小时，这该受到人民多大的谴责啊！
            南口站忽视行车安全  大部分道岔不合标准
    南口段检查小组，于检查了该站九十四付道岔之后，发现仅有四付合乎该段自订的标准。车站侧线道岔轮缘槽浅者一百零七处。材料厂二号道岔拉杆与尖轨脱离，尖轨开口宽度有的竟达一百八十公厘，有的窄到不能过车。材料的缺乏固然是一个原因，而南口车站领导人对于行车安全的疏忽，亦是不可容忍的。去年七月四日至十一月九日，南口站内行车事故发生于道岔上者，即达十一次之多。
    京绥路的大检查运动还在继续进行，发现的问题正在一一解决，张家口铁路分局副局长朱芸生，已于日前出发至各站实行具体督导。
