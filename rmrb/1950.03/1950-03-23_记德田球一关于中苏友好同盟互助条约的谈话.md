　　Record of Tokuda Kyuichi's Conversation on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance

　　The day after the full text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was published, i.e., February 16th, I, as a reporter, visited General Secretary Tokuda at the Japanese Communist Party headquarters in Yoyogi, Tokyo, to inquire about his views.

　　When I arrived, General Secretary Tokuda was in a meeting, but he immediately and gladly received me, shook my hand with his large hand, and gave the following answers to my questions.

　　Reporter: What is your party's view on the recently published Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance?

　　Tokuda: I believe that this Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements have the greatest impact on the world in the current international situation. The reasons are as follows:

　　First, the war instigators of capitalist countries, who once spread rumors that the Soviet Union was engaging in imperialist aggression against the People's Republic of China, have now been completely discredited. The treaty shows how enthusiastically the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are ensuring lasting world peace and the complete independence of all nations. In particular, the Asian nations are very excited about being liberated from their long-suffering colonial and semi-colonial status and establishing a great and strong fortress for the struggle for independence and peace. Especially we Japanese, because there are still reactionary forces in our country who dream of reviving imperialism, and these reactionary forces are colluding with international monopoly capital and its lackeys, the war instigators, feel particularly responsible in this regard. We vow to cleanse the enemies of all nations and the enemies of peace as soon as possible.

　　Second, we are also very excited that the Japanese reactionary forces, along with international monopolists, clamored that "because of the existence of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, Japan has little hope of fully reconciling with the Allied powers of World War II in the short term," have now been exposed; and the powerful conditions for a full reconciliation in the short term according to the Potsdam Declaration, which we have been looking forward to, are now in place. The Japanese people will realize that only the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the countries we can truly rely on most.

　　Third, on the one hand, the Changchun Railway, Dalian, and Lushun Port are returned to China, and all the properties received from Japan are returned to the Chinese government without compensation. In addition, a loan of 300 million US dollars is provided to sincerely assist the revival of the People's Republic of China – this attitude of the Soviet Union concretely practices the主張 of Marxism-Leninism. On the other hand, countries that receive Marshall Plan assistance are forced into bankruptcy; this is a clear contrast. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union supplies China with all kinds of industrial products that are truly needed, with an annual interest rate of only one percent, and the repayment terms are also very favorable; this is completely different from the practices among capitalist countries.

　　This policy provides a bright and concrete program for all nations in the world, especially the nations of the Far East, which have recently been liberated from colonial or semi-colonial status and established people's republics. This will inevitably raise the enthusiasm for revolution and form a great leap forward.

　　Reporter: Article 1 of the treaty emphasizes measures to deal with aggression by Japan or other countries allied with Japan. Therefore, Japan's position in Asia will be closely watched in the future. What is your party's view on this?

　　Tokuda: The provisions of Article 1 of this treaty are a major blow to the obstacles to world peace that are actually occurring in Japan. This will give the Japanese reactionary forces and the international monopoly capital that supports them the most embarrassing pain. On the contrary, the general public believes that this has given great support to the impending people's democratic revolution. The decisive battle between these two forces in Japan will make rapid progress in the future. This decisive battle between these two forces is at a watershed: either Japan will become a base for the Third World War, or it will become a major factor in a great leap forward in the world revolution. We deeply feel that this responsibility is heavy, and we must promote Japan's position as an important base for the world revolution.

　　Reporter: Regarding this treaty, not to mention the Democratic Liberal Party of Japan, but the so-called right-wing socialists also seem to express opposition or dissatisfaction?

　　Tokuda: The right-wing socialists believe that this Sino-Soviet treaty is incomprehensible, but they also seem to express opposition to the Pacific Alliance, claiming that they can maintain peace by standing in a neutral position. This is nothing more than confessing that they are actually slaves of international monopoly capital trying to dominate the world. This attitude of theirs proves that they have long become the most ferocious enemies of the working people, with the working class as the vanguard. In fact, their influence among the people is gradually disappearing.

　　Reporter: This treaty will rapidly promote China's economic development. But I think Japan, which cannot be self-reliant without trade with China, will only increase its economic difficulties if the current situation remains unchanged. What do you think?

　　Tokuda: This treaty and the two agreements will enable China's future revival to develop extremely rapidly, and give us a great impetus to realize trade with Japan as soon as possible. Our party hopes to quickly promote full reconciliation, and hopes to trade freely not only with China, but also with Korea and the Soviet Union. Only in this way can Japan's revival be assisted. At present, Japan's trade is trapped in the abyss of despair due to being increasingly driven into a colonial state. To reverse this crisis, there is only the method of reconciliation with Japan pointed out by this Sino-Soviet treaty.

　　At this point, General Secretary Tokuda ended his conversation on the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, and then made the following remarks on the issue of overseas Chinese in Japan:

　　It is said that overseas Chinese in Japan have recently fallen into a very difficult situation, with unfortunate events such as deaths on the streets, family suicides, and bankruptcies constantly occurring. On the one hand, the Japanese government collects taxes without mercy, and at the same time, it completely fails to provide them with all welfare facilities such as employment security offices and unemployment relief funds and educational loans for the unemployed and the poor. What is even worse is that Chinese, Koreans and foreigners are discriminated against after being distinguished by foreign investment ordinances. Our party will continue to work for these overseas Chinese in Japan in the future. Secondly, it is also said that during the war, the Hanaoka Incident occurred in Akita Prefecture, where 416 Chinese prisoners of war were brutally murdered, and their remains are still scattered everywhere. The Japanese government has not taken any countermeasures and ignored it. This behavior is absolutely unforgivable from a humanitarian point of view. Our party will cooperate with the Overseas Chinese in Japan to solve this problem.

　　记德田球一关于中苏友好同盟互助条约的谈话
    东京华侨民报记者  郑新之
    中苏友好同盟互助条约全文发表之次日、即二月十六日，记者赴东京代代木日本共产党总部访问德田总书记，叩询他的意见。
    记者到时，德田总书记正在开会，但他立刻欣然接见，伸出巨大的手和记者握手，并对记者提出的问题作如下的答复。
    记者：对于这次发表的中苏友好同盟互助条约，贵党看法如何？
    德田：我认为这个中苏友好同盟互助条约和两个协定，在目前国际情势下，是给全世界最大影响的东西。理由有如下三点：
    第一，资本主义各国的战争挑拨者们，曾经造谣苏联在对中华人民共和国作帝国主义的侵略，现在因此而丢尽颜面了。该条约表示了苏联和中华人民共和国是如何热心于确保世界永久和平和各民族的完全独立。特别是亚洲各民族对于从长期受苦的殖民地、半殖民地状态下解放出来，并建立起了为独立和平而斗争的，伟大而强固的堡垒这件事，感到非常兴奋。尤其我们日本人，因为国内仍然存在着梦想复活帝国主义的反动势力，而这个反动势力又和企图支配世界的国际独占资本及其走狗战争挑拨者们相勾结，在这一点上特别感到负有责任。我们立誓早日清扫各民族的敌人及和平的敌人。
    第二，我们而且非常兴奋：日本反动势力曾和国际独占资本家们一道叫嚣过什么“因苏联和中华人民共和国的存在，日本已很难有希望与第二次世界战争时期的同盟国在短时期内全面媾和”，现已受到揭破；而我们所盼望在短时期内按照波茨坦宣言全面媾和的有力条件，也已具备。日本人民将觉悟到，只有苏联和中华人民共和国，才是我们真正最可依靠的国家。
    第三，一方面是：归还中国长春铁路、大连、旅顺口，并将从日本手中所接收的一切财产无偿地归还中国政府。此外，更贷款三万万美元诚心诚意援助中华人民共和国的复兴——苏联这种态度，具体地实践了马克思、列宁主义的主张。另一方面却是：获得马歇尔计划援助的国家，被迫陷入破产状态；这就是一个显明的对比。根据这一次的协定，苏联供给中国以真正需要的各种工业生产品，年利仅一厘，而偿还条件也非常优惠；这与资本主义各国相互间的作法是完全根本不同的。
    这种政策，对于今后新由殖民地状态或半殖民地状态解放出来成立人民共和国的全世界各民族，尤其是远东各民族，提示一种光明的具体纲领，这势必使革命的热情高涨，而形成大的跃进。
    记者：条约的第一条强调对付日本或与日本同盟的其他国家的侵略的措置。因此，今后日本在亚洲的地位，将受到很大的注视。关于这点，贵党见解如何？
    德田：这个条约第一条的规定，对于实际上在日本发生着的世界和平的障碍，是一个重大的打击。这对于日本反动势力和支持着他的国际独占资本，势将给予一个最难堪的苦痛。与此相反，一般人民却相信这已给予行将到来的人民民主主义革命以巨大的支援。日本今后这两个势力的决战，将有飞跃的进展。这种两个势力的决战，正处在一个分水岭上：或者是日本将成为第三次世界战争的据点，或者成为世界革命一大跃进的重大因素。我们痛感这个责任重大，并且必需促使日本的地位成为世界革命的重大据点。
    记者：对于这个条约，除了日本的民主自由党自不用说，而所谓社会党右派，也似乎表示反对或表示不满吧？
    德田：社会党右派认为这个中苏条约不可解，但对于太平洋同盟一说，又似乎表示了反对的立场，声言能够站在中立地位保持和平。这不外在招供实际上他们是企图支配世界的国际独占资本的奴仆。他们这种态度，证明他们早已变成以工人阶级为先锋的劳动人民的最凶恶的敌人。事实上，他们在人民中的影响，已日渐消失了。
    记者：这个条约，将飞跃地促进中国的经济发展事业。但我以为没有对中国的贸易便无法自立的日本，如果目前状况原封不动，只有日益增大经济的困难。尊见以为如何？
    德田：这个条约和两个协定，将使中国今后的复兴有极其急速的发展，并且给予我们以一个很大的推动力，使对日贸易将能尽快地实现。我党热望迅速促进全面媾和，并热望非但能和中国，而且也和朝鲜及苏联自由贸易。只有这样，才能扶助日本复兴。目前，日本的贸易，因日益被驱入殖民地状态而陷进了绝望的深渊。要扭转这种危机，只有这个中苏条约所指出的对日媾和办法。
    至此，德田总书记结束了有关中苏同盟条约的谈话，继而对留日华侨问题作如下的谈话：
    据闻，留日华侨最近已陷入非常困窘的状况，其中不断有路毙、全家自杀及破产等不幸事件发生。而日本政府一方面毫不容情地征收赋税，同时且对他们完全不进行失业者和贫困者的职业安定所和失业救济金、教育贷款等一切福利设施。尤有甚者，并以外资政令等将中国人、朝鲜人和外国人区别后施行差别待遇。我党今后仍将为这些留日华侨而努力。其次，又据闻：战争期间在秋田县曾发生花冈事件，有四百一十六名中国俘虏惨遭虐杀，其遗骨至今仍四处散乱，日本政府对此竟不作任何对策，置之不理。这种行为，就是从人道观点看也绝对不可宽恕。我党将与在日华侨合作，努力解决这个问题。
