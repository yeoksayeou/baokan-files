　　Zhangjiakou City Supplements Collection of Goods Tax
    Overfulfills Task
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily News on March 24th: The Zhangjiakou City Tax Bureau's clearing of the market and supplementary collection of goods tax, which began on February 22nd and ended on March 7th, has been overfulfilled. The tax payment exceeded the original task by slightly less than 120 percent. The main reasons for the achievement were, first, the strictness of inspection and management, which reduced loopholes. In-depth inspection methods were adopted for key industries, with detailed checks based on declaration forms. In this inspection work, not only were the tax evasion phenomena of public and private merchants and various tricks of concealing materials discovered, but also the inspection business was improved a step further. The supplementary tax levied through inspections of taxable but untaxed goods accounted for slightly less than 7.9 percent of the actual tax paid in this supplementary goods tax collection. In addition to inspection, in management, not only was the minimum distribution volume stipulated, but also the control over flower certificates was very strict. For example, the verification stamps for fabrics were stamped with the words "fabrics" to prevent merchants from misusing flower certificates to evade taxes. Secondly, careful review of the supplementary tax goods, flexible control of prices, reduction of errors, and increase in tax revenue. Merchants with large inventories were invited to bring goods to the bureau, and various methods were used to study and determine reasonable tax-paying prices. Organizing forces to urge the declaration of supplementary taxes, expose illegal acts of merchants, and explain policies and supplementary tax methods, and answer merchants' questions, is the third reason for overfulfilling the task of supplementary collection of goods tax. In short, publicity and inspection in tax work are indispensable and powerful guarantees for implementing policies, reducing tax evasion, and completing tasks.

　　张市补征货物税
    超额完成任务
    【本报讯】据三月二十四日察哈尔日报消息：张家口市税务局清理市场补征货物税，自二月二十二日开始截至三月七日已超额完成，纳税额超过了原任务的百分之一百二十弱。获得成绩的主要原因，首先是因稽征与管理的严格，减少了漏洞。对重点行业采取了深入的稽查方法，根据申报表细细查点。在这次稽查工作中，不仅发现了公私商号的逃避税收现象及隐匿物资的种种花样，同时也使稽查业务提高了一步。用稽查的方式查出应税未税的货物而进行补税的，约占这次补征货物税实有纳税额的百分之七点九弱。除稽查外，在管理上不但规定最低分运量，而在花证上掌握的很紧。如布匹的查验证上加盖“布匹”字样戳记，防止了商人乱用花证偷漏税的现象发生。其次是对补税货物精密审核，机动掌握价格，减少了错误，增加了税收。存货较多的商户均被邀拿货到局，用各种方法研究以期确定合理的完税价格。组织力量一面督促申报补税，揭发商人不法行为，一面解释政策和补税办法，解答商人的疑难，是这次超额完成补征货物税任务的第三个原因。总之，在税收工作上的宣传与稽查，是贯彻政策减少偷漏户完成任务必不可缺少的有力保证。
