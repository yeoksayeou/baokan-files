[Reported by our correspondent Kang Weizhong] The various production preparations of a certain Corps of the People's Liberation Army have been largely completed. Starting from the 20th of this month, the various armies of the Corps held grand commencement ceremonies, thus starting a vigorous large-scale production campaign.

　　Cultivated Area: Over 122,500 Mu, Net Profit Estimated: Over 15,500,000 Jin of Millet

　　The production preparation work of the Corps began in December of last year. The Corps Headquarters estimated in advance that under the conditions of the country's financial difficulties this year, the state could not implement large-scale investment in military production. Therefore, it was decided that this year's production task should focus on reliable agricultural production and water conservancy construction projects, combined with various industrial and sideline productions. Undertaking water conservancy projects with labor can accumulate some agricultural production funds, and engaging in diversified sideline production can supplement the inadequacy of military expenses. The production committees at all levels of the Corps actively carried out production preparations in accordance with this spirit. In terms of agricultural production, the cultivated area of the entire Corps has been determined to be 122,572.7 mu, with irrigated land accounting for about 40 percent. Because of the large amount of irrigated land, the required investment is also larger. The water lifting equipment, electric motors, water pumps, diesel engines, and animal-drawn water carts, and manual waterwheels used for irrigation of irrigated land have been purchased, and seeds and fertilizers have been fully prepared. It is estimated that after deducting production costs this year, a net profit of more than 15,525,290 jin of millet can be obtained.

　　Assisting Local Governments in Water Conservancy Projects

　　The Corps also invested part of its strength in this year's spring water conservancy project. The Corps has now reached an agreement with the North China and Hebei Water Conservancy Engineering Bureaus to assist local governments in repairing the Hai River, Xin Kai River, Shi Bei River, Luan River, Ji Yun River, Shuang Cheng River, Chao Bai River, and Sanggan River, etc. These projects require a total of 1,817,000 workdays, and a net profit of 10,924,680 jin of millet can be obtained. In addition, according to the specific production conditions of the garrison, the armies have opened 12 brick kilns, 2 lime kilns, 5 fishing and crab farms, 1 iron factory, 2 pastures, 9 salt drying fields, and 1 each of paper mills, flour mills, egg processing workshops, cigarette factories, and coal kilns. According to preliminary estimates, the annual output will be more than 58.48 million bricks, 17.87 million jin of lime, 1.319 million jin of fish, and some other products. In order to improve their lives, the troops made full use of manpower and material resources to extensively launch vegetable planting, pig raising, sheep raising, chicken raising, and fishing, and also opened tofu workshops, sauce and vinegar workshops, slaughterhouses, and woven bag factories to engage in sideline production.

　　Principles for the Distribution of Production Dividends: Individual: 40 percent, Production Unit Discretionary Funds: 20 percent, Expanded Reproduction: 20 percent, Agricultural Tax: 20 percent.

　　In order to implement the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, the Corps implemented the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, and decided to fairly and reasonably distribute production dividends. It has been drafted that in agricultural production, in addition to production costs, individuals will receive 40 percent of the net profit, the production unit will retain 20 percent as discretionary funds, 20 percent will be invested in expanded reproduction, and 20 percent will be paid to the state as agricultural tax. The net profit of sideline businesses, workshops, and other collective productions will also be implemented according to the principle of profit distribution in agricultural production. In terms of organizational leadership, units above the Corps' divisions have established production committees to grasp the direction of production, review production plans, and inspect the implementation of production plans. Production cooperatives have been established at all levels above the regiment, and production economic committees have been established within the company. Under the leadership of the production committee and the business guidance of the superior cooperative, the production cooperatives have actively promoted various production preparations in recent months, and have achieved great results. Last winter, a certain army braved the severe cold and mobilized all officers and soldiers to beat brambles and weave baskets, preparing tools for digging rivers and carrying soil in advance; a certain division has collected 4 million jin of manure in two months, enabling agricultural preparation work to be completed ahead of schedule. Some units have now started production. A certain division has sown 5,000 mu of spring wheat. A certain army earned a surplus of 1.3 million jin of millet from transportation and purchased 130 additional carts; the salt field of a certain army has begun digging ditches, and the woven bag factory has begun production.

　　Commander Yang's Instructions: Pay Attention to Military-Civilian Relations, Pay Attention to Technical Issues

　　In order to make the army's production better this year, Corps Commander Yang once instructed the entire army: (1) Maintain a solemn military life in production so that the army will not become lax in discipline; (2) Pay attention to military-civilian relations, ensure that there is no competition with the people for profit, no commercial activities are carried out, and no actions are taken that are detrimental to the people and the country. Leading cadres at all levels must consciously and deliberately lead the troops to give the people necessary and possible care and assistance, and pay attention to helping the local poor and families of revolutionary martyrs and cadres; (3) Ensure the physical health of the troops, eat well, rest well, and pay attention to sanitation facilities; (4) Emphasize attention to technical issues, unite experts, technicians, and experienced farmers, and open more technical training classes to popularize technology; (5) Units that do not directly participate in production should pay attention to completing guard work and stand guard vigilantly at their posts at all times.

　　人民解放军某兵团
    生产计划的准备工作
    【本报讯】记者康伟中报道：人民解放军某兵团的各种生产准备工作已大体完成。自本月二十日起，兵团各军分别举行隆重的开工典礼，从而开始了热火朝天的大生产运动。
  垦地面积  十二万二千五百余亩  纯益估计  一千五百余万斤小米
    该兵团的生产准备工作，从去年十二月就开始了。兵团司令部事先估计到在今年国家财政困难的条件下，国家不可能对部队生产实行大规模的投资，因此决定今年的生产任务是以有把握的农业生产与水利建设工程为重点，同时结合各种工业和副业生产。以劳力包揽水利工程可积蓄一部分农业生产资金，多方面的搞副业生产又可补助部队经费之不足。兵团各级生产委员会根据这个精神，积极进行了生产准备工作。在农业生产方面，全兵团垦地面积已确定为十二万二千五百七十二亩七分，水地占百分之四十左右。由于水地多，所需投资也较大。现水地灌溉所用的扬水设备、电动机、抽水机、柴油机及马拉水车、人力水车等已购置妥当，种子及肥料已准备齐全。估计今年除去生产成本外，可得纯益一千五百二十五万二千九百多斤小米。
  协助各地政府兴修水利工程
    该兵团并以一部力量投入今年水利春修工程。现兵团已与华北、河北两水利工程局商妥，协助当地政府兴修海河、新开河、石碑河、滦河、蓟运河、双城河、潮白河及桑乾河等河，这些工程共需一百八十一万七千个工，可得纯益一千零九十二万四千六百八十斤小米。此外，各军根据驻地具体的生产条件，已开设砖窑十二座，石灰窑两座，打鱼蟹场五处，铁工厂一处，牧场两处，晒盐场九处，纸厂、面粉厂、蛋坊、烟厂、煤窑各一处。初步估计，全年可生产砖五千八百四十八万余块，石灰一千七百八十七万斤，鱼一百三十一万九千斤及其他产品一部。各部队为了改善生活，充分利用人力物力，广泛地发动种菜、养猪、养羊、养鸡、打鱼，并开设豆腐房、酱醋房、屠宰房、织草袋厂等，从事副业生产。
  生产红利分配原则  个人：百分之四十，生产单位机动金：百分
        之二十，扩大再生产：百分之二十，农业税：百分之二十。
    为了贯彻毛主席指示的精神，该兵团执行了公私兼顾的原则，决定公平合理地分配生产红利。已拟定在农业生产上除生产成本外，所获纯利个人得百分之四十，生产单位留百分之二十为机动金，投入扩大再生产百分之二十，向国家交纳百分之二十的农业税。副业、作坊及其他集体生产的纯益，亦按农业生产分红的原则执行。在组织领导方面，该兵团师以上的单位均已成立了生产委员会，掌握生产方向，审定生产计划，检查生产计划的执行。团以上各级已成立起生产合作社，连内成立生产经济委员会。生产合作社在生产委员会的领导和上级社的业务指导下，几个月来积极推动各种生产准备工作，成绩很大。某军在去冬冒着严寒，发动全体指战员打荆条编筐，提早准备好挖河扛土的工具；某师两个月已拾粪四百万斤，使农业准备工作能提前完成。有些单位现已开始生产，某师已播种春麦五千亩，某军从运输中盈余一百三十万斤小米，添购大车一百三十辆；某军的盐场已开始挖沟，草袋厂已开始生产。
    杨司令员指示  注意军民关系  注意技术问题
    为了使今年部队的生产搞的更好，该兵团杨司令员曾向全军指示：（一）在生产中必须保持严肃的军事生活，不使部队因此纪律废弛；（二）注意军民关系，除保证不与民争利，不进行商业性活动，不作对人民对国家不利的事情外，各级领导干部必须自觉地有意识地领导部队给人民以必要和可能的照顾帮助，注意帮助当地的贫苦烈军干属；（三）保证部队体力健康，吃得饱，休息得好，注意卫生设备；（四）强调注意技术问题，注意团结专家技师和老农。多开技术训练班，使技术普及起来；（五）不直接担任生产之部队，注意完成警备工作，随时警惕地站在岗位上。
