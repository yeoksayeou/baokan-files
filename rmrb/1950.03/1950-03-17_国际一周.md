    The Great International Significance of the Soviet Elections
    On March 12, the Soviet people victoriously held the second post-war election of the highest organ of state power in the socialist country—the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, unanimously voting in favor of the time-tested candidates nominated by the alliance of party members and non-party members. The Soviet people re-elected Marshal Stalin and his close comrades-in-arms, the most outstanding representatives of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, to the Union Council and the National Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, once again granting them enormous trust and supreme power, enabling them to continue to lead the Soviet people in the struggle to build a communist society, and to lead the people of the world in the struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy.
    The entire process of the Soviet elections demonstrated to the world the indestructible unity of the Soviet people in politics and spirit. And the great leader of all mankind, Stalin, is the banner of this power. Marshal Stalin led the Soviet people, after the October Revolution, to complete the socialist transformation, making the Soviet Union a powerful industrialized and collectivized agricultural country; during the Patriotic War, he defended the fruits of socialist construction, protecting them from the threat of fascist enslavement; in the post-war years, he rapidly healed the wounds of war, winning huge new achievements in industrial and agricultural production, creating spiritual and material conditions for the Soviet people to live a better and more prosperous life. Therefore, this great name—Stalin—is inseparably linked with the thoughts and emotions, hopes and courage, work and life of the Soviet people.
    The entire process of the Soviet elections showed the world the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system and the strong and unconquerable power of the Soviet state. The Central Committee of the CPSU's letter to voters, and the speeches delivered by Shvernik, Voroshilov, Malenkov, and Molotov at the voters' meetings, unanimously used irrefutable facts to illustrate that this powerful socialist country has the most advanced and vibrant social and state system in the world. This system has enabled the entire national economy of the Soviet Union to greatly exceed the pre-war level of 1940, and some important sectors have even greatly exceeded the targets of the Five-Year Plan; this system has enabled the living standards of the Soviet people to continue to improve, with workers' income in 1949 increasing by 24 percent compared to 1940, and farmers' income increasing by 30 percent; this system has also enabled the cultural, scientific, and technological levels of the Soviet people to continuously rise, and Soviet scientists have solved the secrets of atomic energy. Due to the great victories in all aspects of economic construction and cultural construction, the national strength of the Soviet Union, including its armed forces, has grown to an unprecedented level.
    The entire process of the Soviet elections showed the world the consistent principle of the Soviet Union's adherence to a policy of peace. Stalin pointed out that the socialist system and the capitalist system can coexist simultaneously, and that in the competition between the two systems, socialism will ultimately win. Therefore, the Soviet Union needs international peaceful cooperation—solid and lasting peace, and broad and friendly cooperation. The candidates of the alliance of party members and non-party members, especially Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms, clearly reiterated that this important instruction is still followed by Soviet foreign policy today. But the Soviet Union is not a pacifist, the Soviet Union is not afraid of any threats. The candidates of the alliance of party members and non-party members unanimously stated to all voters that the Soviet government, loyal to the cause of peace, will take all measures to participate in various actions and plans to prevent a new war.
    The victorious outcome of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will undoubtedly guarantee the Soviet Union's rapid march towards new victories in building a communist society, and guarantee that the peace, democracy, and socialism camp, organized on an international scale, will more forcefully strike at the aggressive forces of imperialism.
  Support the Peace Proposals of the Standing Committee
    In order to implement the spirit of the declaration of the second plenary session in November last year, the executive bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace organized a delegation in late February to deliver appeals to the parliaments of various countries, putting forward two proposals for universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The delegation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, which arrived in Moscow, was warmly and sincerely welcomed by the Soviet people. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was the first to give a satisfactory reply to the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace's appeal to defend peace. The two proposals in the appeal are completely in line with the Soviet Union's unwavering desire to eliminate all hotbeds of war and consolidate world peace. This shows that the Soviet Union's peace policy has gained widespread support from the people of the world.
    At the same time, US imperialism refused to allow the delegation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to enter the country. Not long ago, under pressure from the American people's desire for peace, US imperialist elements once spread the smokescreen of negotiations with the Soviet Union, attempting to alleviate the dissatisfaction of the American people. Truman once stated that "perhaps it would not be a bad idea to send Vinson to the Soviet Union to inform the Soviet Union of America's peaceful intentions." Republican Senator Smith, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Connally, and former Republican presidential candidate Stassen also put forward proposals for negotiations with the Soviet Union. But when the American people further demanded that action be taken to promote friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and international peaceful cooperation, the American warmongers panicked. They not only stopped talking about "US-Soviet talks" and the "Vinson mission to the Soviet Union plan," but also, in such a rude and unreasonable manner, used the despicable means of refusing visas to prevent the delegation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, which was expected by millions of American people, from entering the United States. Is it not clear that what US imperialist elements need is not peace, but war, and that the rhetoric they created about negotiations with the Soviet Union is false?
    However, this does not indicate the strength of US imperialism, but only indicates that it is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and only indicates that it feels fear and unease in the face of the growing forces of peace. This cannot hinder the development of the peace movement; on the contrary, the American people are using a more resolute struggle to support the peace proposals of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.
    Accelerating the "Americanization" of the Republic of Indonesia
    The Republic of Indonesia, which was established at the end of December last year according to the "Hague Agreement," is undergoing significant changes: the forces of Dutch imperialism are rapidly being weakened, and the forces of US imperialism have gradually taken a dominant position. US Ambassador to Jakarta Cochrane—the director of the Hague Round Table Conference—is today the supreme authority and actual ruler of the Republic of Indonesia. Dutch High Commissioner Hirschfeld has become his assistant and supporting role. The Sukarno-Hatta group is increasingly openly selling out and implementing the aggressive policies of US imperialism.
    According to reports from various sources, the "Americanization" of the Republic of Indonesia is progressing at an alarming rate. After Sukarno issued the New Year's message of "warmly welcoming foreign investment," a large number of agents of American monopoly capitalists, led by Fox, swarmed into Indonesia like locusts, seizing patents for plantations, large enterprises, and so on. The US Export-Import Bank has granted the Hatta government a political loan of 100 million yuan. Wall Street has decided to use Indonesia as the main target of the "Point Four Program." Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Sastro assured Truman on February 22 that private US investment in Indonesia would not be subject to any restrictions. US aggressors not only want to economically exploit Indonesia, but also believe that "Indonesia is the most legitimate country in need of military assistance" (USIS). A delegation from MacArthur's headquarters has already secretly negotiated with the Hatta government in Jakarta, proposing to conduct "military surveys" and "strategic measurements."
    US imperialism is increasingly openly kicking aside its partner—the Netherlands—and wants to directly control Indonesia. The recently developing "dissolution of regional states movement" is an important step for US imperialism to further strike at Dutch forces through the Sukarno-Hatta group. As is well known, the current Republic of Indonesia consists of sixteen units, of which all except the Republic of Indonesia are puppet regional states established by the Dutch colonial authorities, the so-called "federalists." Before and after the Hague Round Table Conference, the "federalists" played a considerable role in resisting the "republicans" of Sukarno and Hatta. In the Hatta government, the "federalists" are still the most reliable supporters of the Dutch colonial authorities. Under the instructions of Cochrane, the general agent of US imperialism in Indonesia, the Sukarno-Hatta group launched the "dissolution of regional states movement," and the puppet leaders of various important regional states were forced to resign one after another. Sukarno officially announced the cancellation of the three "autonomous regions" of East Java, West Java, and Madura on the 9th. The dissolution of regional states clearly means the further weakening of the aggressive forces of Dutch imperialism in Indonesia.

    苏联选举的伟大国际意义
    苏联人民已经在三月十二日胜利地举行了社会主义国家最高权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃的战后第二次大选，一致投票拥护党与非党联盟所提出的久经考验的候选人。苏联人民把斯大林大元帅和他的亲密战友们，把工人、集体农民和知识分子的最优秀的代表们，再度选入了苏联最高苏维埃的联盟院和民族院，再度给予巨大信任和最高权力，使他们继续为领导苏联人民建设共产主义社会而斗争，为领导全世界人民争取持久和平与人民民主而斗争。
    苏联选举的全部过程，向全世界表现了苏联人民在政治上精神上不可摧毁的团结力量。而全人类的伟大领袖斯大林则是这种力量的旗帜。斯大林大元帅领导苏联人民，在十月革命以后，完成了社会主义的转化，使苏联成为强大的工业与农业集体化的国家；在爱国战争期间，保卫了社会主义建设的果实，免受法西斯奴役的威胁；在战后年代，又迅速医治了战争创伤，赢得工农业生产的巨大新成就，给苏联人民创造了更美好、更富裕的生活的精神条件和物质条件。因此这个伟大的名字——斯大林，就与苏联人民的思想和情感、希望和勇气、工作和生活，不可分离地联系在一起。
    苏联选举的全部过程，向全世界显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性以及苏维埃国家强盛而不可被征服的力量。联共中央的告选民书，什维尔尼克、伏罗希洛夫、马林科夫和莫洛托夫先后在选民大会上所发表的演讲，一致以无可争辩的事实，说明这个强大的社会主义国家，乃是具有世界上最先进的和最有生气的社会与国家制度。这个制度使苏联整个国民经济大大超过战前一九四○年的水平，有些重要部门甚至已大大超过五年计划的目标；这个制度使苏联人民的生活水平继续提高，一九四九年工人收入比一九四○年增加百分之二十四，农民收入增加百分之三十；这个制度也使苏联人民的文化、科学、技术水平不断上升，苏联科学家已解决了原子能的秘密。由于经济建设和文化建设各方面的巨大胜利，苏联的国力，包括武装部队在内，已强大到前所未有的程度。
    苏联选举的全部过程，向全世界表明了苏联坚持和平政策的一贯原则。斯大林曾指出，社会主义制度和资本主义制度可以同时并存，而在两种制度的竞赛中，社会主义将获得最后胜利。因此苏联需要国际和平合作——巩固的持久和平，广泛的友好合作。这次党与非党联盟的候选人，特别是斯大林的最亲密的战友们，明确地重申这一重要训示今天依然为苏联的外交政策所遵循。但苏联并不是和平的绥靖主义者，苏联不害怕任何威胁。党与非党联盟的候选人，一致向全体选民表示，忠于和平事业的苏联政府将采取一切方法，参加各种行动和计划，以防止新战争。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举的胜利结果，无疑将保证苏联迅速走向建设共产主义社会的新胜利，保证在国际规模上组织起来的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，将更为有力地打击帝国主义的侵略力量。
  拥护和大常委会的和平建议
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的执行局，为贯彻去年十一月间第二届全体会议宣言的精神，于二月下旬组织代表团，分别向各国议会递送呼吁书，提出普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器的两项建议。抵达莫斯科的和大代表团，受到苏联人民盛大和真诚的欢迎。苏联最高苏维埃对于和大常委会保卫和平的呼吁书，首先给予满意的答复。呼吁书中的两项建议，完全符合于苏联要消灭一切战争温床，巩固世界和平这一始终不渝的愿望。这就说明了苏联的和平政策，已经获得了全世界人民的广泛支持。
    与此同时，美帝国主义却拒绝了和大代表团入境。不久以前，美帝国主义分子在美国人民渴望和平的压力下，曾一度散播对苏谈判的烟幕，企图借此缓和一下美国人民的不满情绪。杜鲁门曾表示“也许派文森到苏联去，将美国和平意图告知苏联的想法是不坏的”。共和党参议员史密斯、参院外交委员会主席康纳利以及前共和党总统竞选人史塔生等，也提出了对苏谈判的建议。但当美国人民进一步要求采取行动以促进对苏友好关系与国际和平合作的时候，美国的好战分子却着慌了，他们不仅不谈什么“美苏会谈”、“文森使苏计划”，并且，那样蛮悍无理，以拒绝签证的卑劣手段，不让正为千百万美国人民所期待着的和大代表团进入美国境内。美帝国主义分子所需要的不是和平，而是战争，它们所制造的对苏谈判言论的虚伪性，这难道还不明白吗？
    然而，这并非表示美帝国主义的强大，只是表示它外强中干，只是表示它在日益增长的和平力量面前感到恐惧不安。这更不能阻碍和平运动的发展，恰恰相反，美国人民正以更坚决的斗争，来拥护和大常委会的和平建议。
    加速“美国化”的印尼合众国
    去年十二月底根据《海牙协议》所产生的印尼合众国，正在发生显著的变化：荷兰帝国主义的势力迅速的被削弱着，美帝国主义的势力已逐渐居于统治的地位。驻雅加达的美国大使柯契伦——海牙圆桌会议的导演人，今天是印尼合众国的最高权威和实际统治者。荷兰高级专员赫什菲德则变成了他的助手和配角。而苏加诺、哈达集团则日益明显地卖身投靠，执行着美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    据各方面的消息显示：印尼合众国的“美国化”，正以惊人的速度在推进着。苏加诺发表了“热烈欢迎外国投资”的元旦文告之后，以福克斯为首的大批美国垄断资本家代理人，像蝗虫一般地涌往印尼，攫取种植园、大企业等等专利权。美国进出口银行已给予哈达政府以一亿元的政治性信用贷款。华尔街决定以印尼作为“第四点计划”的主要对象。而印尼驻美大使沙斯特罗则于二月二十二日向杜鲁门保证：美国在印尼的私人投资将不受到任何限制。美国侵略分子不仅要从经济上榨取印尼，并且认为“印尼是一个需要军事援助的最合法的国家”（美新处）麦克阿瑟总部的参谋团代表已经在雅加达与哈达政府秘密谈判，提出进行“军事调查”与“战略测量”的要求了。
    美帝国主义越来越露骨地要一脚踢开它的小伙伴——荷兰，要直接控制印尼。最近正在发展中的“邦区解消运动”，是美帝国主义通过苏加诺、哈达集团进一步打击荷兰势力的一个重要步骤。如所周知，构成目前印尼合众国的，共有十六个单位，其中除了印尼共和国以外，都是由荷兰殖民当局一手扶植起来的傀儡邦区，即所谓“联邦派”。在海牙圆桌会议前后，“联邦派”曾起了抵制苏加诺、哈达的“共和派”的相当作用。在哈达政府中，“联邦派”依然是荷兰殖民当局最可靠的支持者。苏加诺、哈达集团在美帝国主义在印尼的总代理人——柯契伦的指使之下，策动“邦区解消运动”，各重要邦区的傀儡首长被迫纷纷辞职，苏加诺并于九日正式宣布取消东爪哇、西爪哇和马都拉三个“自治邦”。邦区的解消，显然意味着荷兰帝国主义在印尼侵略势力的进一步削弱。
