　　Italian Calabria Province
    Farmers' Land Occupation Movement Expands
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 15th] TASS, Rome, March 15th: Bossi, General Secretary of the Italian Agricultural Workers' Union, told a reporter from Unità that the scale of the farmers' land occupation movement in Calabria Province (southern Italy) is expanding daily.
    The farmers in this province are not only fighting for their own bread, but are fully aware of the need for land reform, the elimination of the manorial system, and the ability to use the forces of labor and capital to change Calabria's economy. All the farmers understand this need, so they show unprecedented combative unity and solidarity.
    Bossi continued: The poverty of the majority of the peasant masses is the main reason why other economic sectors cannot develop. Now everyone has recognized that landlords occupying vacant land are their common enemy.
    When poor farmers occupy the land of landlords, middle and even wealthy farmers show their solidarity with the former, lending them farm tools and seeds, and donating money to relief funds. This not only creates consistency in the actions of various trade union organizations, but also creates the prerequisites for organizing a united front among various parties with different political views within the Calabria region.

　　意加拉勃利亚省
    农民占地运动扩大
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社罗马十五日讯：意大利农业工人联合会总书记博西向团结报记者称：加拉勃利亚省（意大利南部）农民占地运动的规模，已日益扩大。
    该省的农民不只为他们自己争取面包，而是完全意识到需要土地改革，消灭庄园制度，并让劳动和资本的力量，能够用来改变加拉勃利亚的经济。全体农民明白这种需要，因此表现了空前的战斗性的统一和团结。
    博西继称：占人口压倒多数的农民大众的贫困，是其它经济部门不能发展的主要原因。现在每一个人都已认清占有空地的地主，是他们的共同敌人。
    当贫苦农民占领地主的土地时，中等农民甚至富裕农民都表现了他们和前者的团结，借给他们农具和种籽，并且捐款作救济基金。这不但造成各工会组织的行动的一致，并且为加拉勃利亚区内政治见解不同的各方面，造成了组织联合阵线的先决条件。
