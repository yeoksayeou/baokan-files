　　How to Consolidate Winter School Achievements and Persist in Mass Education Work?
　　Editor's Note:
　　When winter schools in various places come to an end, they should conduct necessary summaries under leadership. The experiences published in this newspaper today are worthy of reference for various localities. The purpose of our summarizing the work of winter schools is to consolidate existing achievements and further improve the cultural and political level of the masses. The experience of running winter schools in Shandong and other places proves that as long as they are closely combined with the life interests of the masses and truly serve production, our winter schools or civil schools will surely receive the great support of the masses. The masses will voluntarily transform winter schools into year-round schools. We hope that all localities will carefully summarize the work of winter schools and launch discussions on the important issue of how to persist in mass education work during the Great Production Movement, ideologically raise the consciousness of farmers, and better promote the production movement in the future.

　　如何巩固冬学成绩  坚持群众教育工作？
    编者按：
    各地冬学在结束的时候，都应有领导地进行必要的总结。今天本报发表的几篇经验是值得各地参考的。我们总结冬学工作的目的是为了巩固已有的成绩，进一步提高群众的文化政治水平。山东等地办冬学的经验证明：只要同群众生活利益有着密切的结合，真正是为生产服务，那么，我们的冬学或是民校便一定会得到群众极大的拥护。群众便会自愿地使冬学转为常年学校。我们希望各地认真总结冬学工作，并对今后如何在大生产运动中坚持群众教育工作，从思想上提高农民觉悟，以更好地推动生产运动这一重要问题展开讨论。
