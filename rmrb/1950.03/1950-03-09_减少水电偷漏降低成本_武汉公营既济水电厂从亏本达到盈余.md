Reducing Water and Electricity Theft and Leakage Reduces Costs
    Wuhan's Publicly Operated Jiji Water and Electricity Plant Achieves Profitability from Losses
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th) Wuhan's largest publicly operated Jiji Water and Electricity Plant has gone from consistently losing money to being highly profitable. In June and July of last year, the plant lost more than 300 million RMB, while in the three months from November of last year to January of this year, profits reached more than 2.1 billion RMB. This significant turnaround in the Jiji Water and Electricity Plant's business is mainly due to reduced water and electricity theft and leakage, and lower production costs. For example, in the past, personnel at the water and electricity plant emphasized that the alum feeding machine could not use domestically produced white alum, but with the suggestion and promotion of workers, the alum feeding machine was finally modified to use domestic alum, thereby reducing water production costs. Workers in the plant's boiler room spontaneously launched a competition to save coal. Many workers crushed coal and mixed it with water before starting work. As a result, 2,400 tons of coal were saved in January of this year compared to before liberation. Of major importance in reducing costs was the inspection of water and electricity theft and leakage. The water and electricity departments have systematically organized worker's spare time service teams to check water and electricity theft and leakage. In September of last year, more than 600 places of theft and leakage were found. According to statistics from January of this year, water leakage has been reduced by 20% compared to before liberation, while electricity leakage has been reduced by 60%. Before liberation, the Wuhan Jiji Water and Electricity Plant was a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise of the Song Ziwen faction and was the main source of water and electricity for hundreds of large and small public and private industries and nearly one million citizens in Hankou and Hanyang. Due to poor management, water and electricity theft and leakage had been serious for years. Some water pipes and water meters had been leaking for three or four years without anyone addressing it. The amount of coal burned per kilowatt-hour was frequently over 2 kilograms.

### 减少水电偷漏降低成本  武汉公营既济水电厂从亏本达到盈余

　　减少水电偷漏降低成本
    武汉公营既济水电厂从亏本达到盈余
    【新华社武汉八日电】武汉规模最大的公营既济水电厂已从经常亏本做到大有盈余。去年六、七两月该厂亏蚀人民币三亿余元，而在去年十一月至今年一月的三个月中盈余达到人民币二十一亿余元。既济水电厂这一营业上的重大转变，主要是由于减少了水电偷漏和降低了生产成本所致。如过去水电厂人员强调下矾机不能用国产白矾，但在工人的建议和推动下，终于将下矾机改装成能用国矾，制水成本因而降低，电厂锅炉房工人自动发起节省燃煤的竞赛，许多工人上班前便把煤块捣碎搀水，今年一月份因此比解放前节省煤二千四百余吨。对减低成本有重大作用的是检查水电偷漏，水电两课曾有计划地组织检查水电偷漏的工余服务队。去年九月份即查出偷漏的地方六百余处。据今年一月份的统计。水的偷漏比解放前减少了百分之二十，电的偷漏则减少了百分之六十。按武汉既济水电厂解放前为宋子文系的官僚资本企业，是汉口、汉阳数百家大小公私工业和近百万市民需用水电的主要来源，由于经营不善，历年水电偷漏现象严重，有的水管、水表漏坏了三四年之久却无人过问；每度电的燃煤量，经常在二公斤以上。
