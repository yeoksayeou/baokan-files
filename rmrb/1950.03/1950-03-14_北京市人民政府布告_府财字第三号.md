Beijing Municipal People's Government Proclamation
Municipal Finance No. 3

1.  The deadline for collecting the winter property tax for 1949 has long passed; the deadline for collecting the spring property tax for 1950 is approaching. It has been decided to collect both seasons together. All businesses must pay at the various People's Banks and their temporary entrusted locations by May 5th after receiving the notification. Late payments will be penalized. We hope all taxpayers will prepare early or pre-purchase tax grain coupons so that they can pay on time.

2.  For this combined collection of two seasons, a single notification will be issued. All property owners and managers must report any property transfers, changes in usage, or address changes to the tax sub-bureaus in their respective districts by the end of March. Failure to report by the deadline will result in assessment and taxation based on the original records.

3.  The taxpayer is the property owner. If the property rights are unclear or the house is ownerless, the current user shall temporarily pay the tax. No excuses will be accepted to shirk this responsibility, in order to fulfill the people's tax obligations and guarantee fiscal revenue.

4.  Payment notifications will be delivered by post. No owner, householder, current user, or manager may refuse or return them without good reason.

5.  The total amount of the two seasons' property tax listed on the payment notification, plus the 30% surcharge for sanitation and education, will be converted to local currency by the People's Bank at the day's grain price. Those holding tax grain coupons can use them at a rate of one jin of grain per coupon.

6.  Property tax collection will now be entirely handled by the Municipal Taxation Bureau. If taxpayers have any questions, they can contact the tax sub-bureaus in their respective districts. The addresses of the tax sub-bureaus and their temporary jurisdictions for property tax collection are announced as follows:

    First Tax Sub-bureau: 41 Wangzhima Hutong, Third District; responsible for the entirety of the First and Third Districts.

    Second Tax Sub-bureau: 21 Jiu Xingbu Street, Second District; responsible for the entirety of the Third, Seventh, and Fourth Districts.

    Third Tax Sub-bureau: 4 Muchang Hutong, Eighth District; responsible for the entirety of the Eighth and Tenth Districts.

    Fourth Tax Sub-bureau: Old Zhimeilou, Meishi Street, Ninth District; responsible for the entirety of the Ninth, Twelfth, and Eleventh Districts.

    Eighth Tax Sub-bureau: 6 Sanzuo Bridge, Fifth District; responsible for the entirety of the Fifth and Sixth Districts.

7.  We hope everyone will comply.

Mayor: Nie Rongzhen
