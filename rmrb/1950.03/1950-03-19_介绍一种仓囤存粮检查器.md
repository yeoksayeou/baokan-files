　　Introducing a Grain Storage Inspector
    Yao Huipu
    The newspaper has published news several times about the spoilage of public grain in storage due to overheating, and the amount of damage is considerable. This is mainly because our public grain keepers lack experience in storage. The overheating of grain is mostly due to the difficulty in inspecting the central part of the stored grain. I think the method of inspecting stored grain needs to be studied. I have carefully read the inspection method of Liban Village in Sheng County, Zhejiang, published in the People's Daily on February 26th. That method is imperfect, because if the cloth on the tip of the bamboo falls off midway, it will not achieve the purpose of inspection. I know of a tool for inspecting warehouses that is more convenient to use than the aforementioned tool and is also easy to manufacture. Now I introduce it to comrades who manage public grain for reference. Manufacturing method: Use a thick iron pipe with a diameter of about one inch to make a hollow conical body about seven or eight inches long (as shown in the figure). At a distance of about four inches from the tip, open a rectangular small hole of more than one inch long. Install a valve (also made of thick iron) on this hole. The valve shaft is located at "A", and a small part of the upper part of the door "B" should protrude. "C" is a wooden pole, the length of which is optional. When using it, whether on the top or side of the stored grain, just close the valve and insert it into the grain to the required depth. After that, pull it out, and the protruding part "B" of the valve will be blocked by the grain particles and will naturally open, and the grain particles will flow into it. After pulling it out, inspecting the grain inside will let you know the internal condition of the stored grain. This method has been tried and the results are very good. This tool can be made by bicycle repair workers and general ironworkers. Comrades who manage public grain can try it.

　　介绍一种仓囤存粮检查器
    姚卉圃
    报纸上几次刊出公粮在库内发热损坏的消息，并且损坏数量相当大。这主要是因为我们的公粮保管者还缺乏保管经验的原故。粮食的发热，大半是因检查存粮的中心部分不容易。我认为检查存粮的方法，是需要研究的。我曾注意地读了二月二十六日人民日报所登载浙江嵊县里板村的检查方法，那种方法是不完善的，因为竹尖上的破布如果中途脱落，就不能达到检查的目的。我知道一种检查仓囤的工具，使用起来较上述工具便利，并且也容易制造，现在介绍给管理公粮的同志们参考。制法：用直径约一英寸的厚铁管做成约七、八英寸长的中空圆锥形体（如图），在距尖端约四寸的地方，开一长英寸余的长方小洞。这洞上按一活门（也用厚铁），门轴位于“甲”，门的上方“乙”处应使突出一小部分。“丙”为木杆，长短随意。使用时，不论在存粮的上方或侧方，只要把活门关好插入粮内，至所需深度后，向外一拔，活门突出部“乙”为粮粒所阻，自然张开，粮粒流入其中，拔出后检查其中的粮食就可以知道存粮内部如何了。这种方法曾经试用，结果很好。这种工具，修理自行车的工人和一般铁工都可以做，保管公粮的同志们可以试用。
