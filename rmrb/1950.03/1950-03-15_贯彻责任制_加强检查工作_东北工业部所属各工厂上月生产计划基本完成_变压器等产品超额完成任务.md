　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: Factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department basically completed their production plans for February, with some products exceeding the plan. Among the thirty-seven major products, transformers exceeded the plan by 45 percent, electrolytic copper by 44 percent, paper by 40 percent, cement production by 25 percent, raw coal by 11 percent, gasoline by 16 percent, and machine tools by 6 percent. Other products such as pig iron, coke, electricity generation, electric motors, bicycles, concentrated sulfuric acid, and rubber products also exceeded the plan.

　　In January, more than half of the factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department failed to complete their planned tasks. The production plan for February was also higher than that of January. In addition, due to the Spring Festival holiday, workers in most factories and mines only worked for 21 days. Therefore, at the beginning of February, the Northeast Industrial Department instructed all units to implement the responsibility system ideologically, organizationally, and institutionally, strengthen inspection work, and ensure the completion of the February production plan. Leaders of various bureaus and companies personally went to the affiliated mines and factories to conduct work inspections, and took concrete measures to overcome difficulties, finally completing the doubly arduous production task.

　　贯彻责任制·加强检查工作
    东北工业部所属各工厂上月生产计划基本完成
    变压器等产品超额完成任务
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿二月份已基本上完成了该月的生产计划，有的产品并已超过计划。在三十七种主要产品中，变压器超过计划百分之四十五，电解铜超过计划百分之四十四，纸张超过百分之四十，水泥生产超过计划百分之二十五，原煤超过计划百分之十一，汽油超过计划百分之十六，工作母机超过计划百分之六，其他炼铁、焦炭、发电量、电动机、自行车、浓硫酸、橡胶制品等皆超过计划。
    东北工业部所属各厂矿在一月份曾有半数以上的单位未完成计划所规定的任务，而二月份的生产计划却又高于一月份计划，加上春节假日，除少数部门外，一般厂矿工人实际只工作二十一天。为此，东北工业部于二月初即指示各单位要从思想上、组织上、制度上贯彻责任制，加强检查工作，切实保证二月份生产计划的完成。各局和各公司的领导人员又亲赴所属矿厂进行了工作检查，并采取具体措施，克服困难，终于完成了加倍艰巨的生产任务。
