　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Since March 11th, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has been organizing migration to the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan for agricultural production. As of March 17th, five batches of tricycle workers, totaling 625 households and 2,483 people, have safely arrived in Suiyuan, receiving care and welcome from the local government and people. To properly resettle the migrants, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government instructed the seven counties of Fengzhen, Jining, Longsheng, Wudong, Liangcheng, Xinghe, and Taolin last winter to reserve better-quality land for allocation to the migrants coming from Beijing this spring. It also repeatedly instructed the aforementioned seven counties to make various preparations. Each county, following these instructions, has established reception stations in county towns and appropriate villages to handle reception, transfer, and distribution work. Local villagers have also been organized to prepare housing and some furniture. Counties farther from the railway line have prepared vehicles to transport the elderly, infirm, women, children, and luggage. Prior to the departure of the five batches of migrants from Beijing to Suiyuan, cadres from the province were sent to Beijing to receive and transport them. The Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Tricycle Workers' Union also dispatched personnel to assist with the escort. Upon arrival in Suiyuan, the local people and students lined up to welcome them, waving red flags, dancing the Yangge, and shouting slogans. Village governments allocated housing and provided grain loans on the same day. The tricycle workers were deeply moved by the government's meticulous care. Zhang Ming, a tricycle worker from the Fourth District, upon arriving in Liangcheng, said to those escorting them: "When I was in Beijing, I knew that pedaling a tricycle had no future, but I was worried that coming to Suiyuan might not be good either. Now I understand. From now on, I must work hard in production to repay the People's Government and Chairman Mao!"

　　京市三轮车工人五批安抵绥远
    受到当地政府、人民热烈照顾
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府自本月十一日开始移民察、绥两省，从事农业生产，截至本月十七日止，先后已有三轮车工人五批共六百二十五户，二千四百八十三人安抵绥远，受到当地政府与人民的照顾和欢迎。绥远省人民政府为了妥善安置移民，曾于去年冬天指令丰镇、集宁、龙胜、武东、凉城、兴和、陶林等七县，留下质量较好的土地分配给今年春天来自北京的移民，并数次指示上述七县作好各种准备工作。各县根据指示均已于县城及适当村庄普遍设立了招待站负责招待，转送及分发等工作，并组织各村居民准备了房屋和部分家具，距离铁路线较远的几县还准备了车辆接运老弱妇孺和行李。前此五批移民离京去绥时，均有该省干部来京接运，北京市人民政府和三轮车工会也派了工作人员协同护送。到达绥远时，该地人民和学生高举红旗扭着秧歌呼着口号排队迎接，各村政府当天就分配了房屋，贷给了口粮。三轮车工人对政府的这种周密的照顾深受感动。四区的三轮车工人张明到达凉城后，对护送他们的人说：“我在北京时明知蹬三轮没前途，但却耽心到绥远来，也未必好；现在我才明白了。今后一定要努力生产，报答人民政府和毛主席！”
