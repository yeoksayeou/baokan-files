　　North China, Northeast China and other places
    Train more than 8,000 delivery personnel
    Improve maternal and infant hygiene and reduce infant mortality
    [Report from this newspaper] According to comprehensive reports from various sources: Since last autumn, North China, East China, and parts of Shandong Province have successively held midwifery training classes to train new rural midwifery personnel and transform old midwives, and have made preliminary achievements in reducing infant mortality and improving maternal and infant hygiene work. According to incomplete statistics: In the North China region, Hengshui, Tongxian, and Tianjin special districts in Hebei Province, Xingxian special district in Shanxi Province, and Pingyuan and Chahar provinces, a total of more than 5,300 midwifery personnel were trained; In the nineteen counties of the six northeastern provinces, a total of 2,839 midwifery personnel were trained by the end of last year. The Lunan Administrative Office District and Weihaiwei and Yantai cities in the Jiaodong District of Shandong Province have all conducted midwifery training classes on a trial basis.
    The newly trained old and new delivery personnel returned to their villages, adopted new delivery methods, and implemented disinfection, which greatly reduced the deaths and illnesses of infants and puerperae. For example, in 38 villages in the eighth district of Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, 103 babies delivered using the new method, except for one monster, two miscarriages, and two dystocias, were all healthy. A survey in Tonghua County, Liaodong Province, showed that 51 old midwives had previously delivered a total of 240 children, of which only 128 survived; while the midwifery personnel who graduated from the first phase in the county delivered 414 children (including 8 cases of dystocia and transverse presentation), and except for individual cases where death occurred immediately after birth due to maternal illness, most were very healthy. In the seventh district of Huilan County, the province, after eight midwives were trained in a town, they delivered 62 babies within a month after returning, and none of them suffered from convulsions. After Li, an old woman in the sixth district, was trained, she delivered 18 babies, four of whom were pseudo-dead, and she resuscitated them all with artificial respiration. Another old woman, Shao, who had not been trained, threw away three pseudo-dead babies (locally known as "grass confused"), so Shao also requested training. Village cadres wrote to the Women's Federation of Huilan County and said: "The training classes you are running are truly liberating women!"
    At the same time, the trained midwifery personnel gained preliminary physiological and hygiene knowledge, and after returning, they carried out publicity, which played a great role in breaking feudal superstitions and improving maternal and infant hygiene in rural areas. Some also promoted maternal and infant hygiene education through methods such as taking apprentices, holding women's symposiums, and making family visits, which were welcomed by the majority of women. For example, in Hailun County, Liaodong Province, 170 midwives who were trained in two phases competed with each other to become models on the condition of taking apprentices. Midwives in the five districts of the county cooperated with trained midwives to hold hygiene lectures every five days in villages as units, and women in the villages who were unwilling to attend meetings were also happy to listen to the lectures.
    Most of the trained midwifery personnel in various places are old midwives in rural areas, and the rest are women cadres and young women intellectuals. The training time is generally seven days to half a month, mainly teaching new delivery methods, disinfection methods, breaking superstitious ideas and correcting various unhygienic and unscientific habits; at the same time, teaching general hygiene knowledge to protect mothers and babies. Some areas have also established relatively long-term midwifery schools to train professional midwifery personnel, and use them as the backbone to carry out extensive transformation of old midwives and promote maternal and infant hygiene work.
    Experience has proven that when transforming old midwives, it is best to first select old midwives with better composition, upright style, and not too old age for training; when mobilizing them to enroll, it is necessary to open up their thinking and eliminate concerns such as "being afraid of paying delivery taxes after training" and "being afraid of becoming government officials", and appropriately take care of their production. For women cadres and young women intellectuals, it is necessary to persuade and educate them to make them understand the importance of delivery work and eliminate their wrong understanding such as "delivery is an inferior thing". It is best to cite the comparison of the number of deaths between new and old delivery methods for education. Some training classes mobilize old midwives to count the number of deaths of children they have delivered in the past; or inspire mothers who have given birth to many children and are infertile to tell the stories of the deaths of their babies in the past, which can motivate the learning enthusiasm of the trainees. In teaching, it is necessary to take care of the trainees' ability to accept, and it is best to use more discussions to inspire students - especially old midwives with many years of experience - to speak first, and then study them one by one, point out their usable experience, and criticize their wrong methods; in particular, it is necessary to make them ideologically value the importance of disinfection and break various superstitious legends. Use more pictures, models and real objects to help students understand and remember when lecturing. If there is an opportunity, it is best to enable students to visit new delivery methods or do internships. Medical terms should be minimized and replaced with common names familiar to students. At the end of the training class, it is necessary to prepare disinfection medicines and cotton wool, etc., and mobilize students to buy them back to avoid difficulties in purchasing after returning home. In addition, local governments and organs should give support and help to the trainees who return home, solve their specific difficulties, and make them achieve good results to influence the masses and gradually improve rural maternal and infant hygiene work.

### 华北、东北等地  训练八千余接产人员  改进妇婴卫生婴儿死亡率减低

　　华北、东北等地
    训练八千余接产人员
    改进妇婴卫生婴儿死亡率减低
    【本报讯】综合各方报道：华北、华东各地和山东省的部分地区，去秋以来纷纷举办助产训练班，培养新的农村助产人员和改造旧接产妇，在减低婴儿死亡率，改进妇婴卫生工作上已有初步成绩。据不完全材料统计：华北区的河北省衡水、通县、天津三个专区，山西省兴县专区以及平原、察哈尔两省，共训练了助产人员五千三百余人；东北六省的十九个县，到去年年底共训练了助产人员二千八百三十九人。山东省的鲁中南行署区和胶东区的威海卫、烟台两市，都试办了助产训练班。
    受过训练的新旧接产人员回村后，采用了新的接生法和施行消毒，大大地减少了婴孩、产妇的死亡和病患。如河北省涿县八区三十八个村，以新法接生的一百零三个婴孩，除一个怪胎、两个小产与两个难产之外，其余都很健康。辽东省通化县调查：五十一名旧产婆以前共接生二百四十个小孩，只活了一百二十八个；而该县第一期毕业的助产人员，接产小孩四百一十四个（内有难产、横产八个），除个别的因母亲有病生下即死亡外，一般均很健壮。该省惠兰县七区一个镇有八名接产妇受训之后，回去一月内接生六十二个小孩，没有一个患抽疯的。六区受训后的李老太太，接生十八个小孩，其中四名是假死，她都用人工呼吸法把孩子救活了。另外一个邵老太太未受训，接了三个假死（当地俗通叫“草迷”）的孩子都被扔掉了，因此邵老太太也要求受训。村干部们写信给惠兰县妇联说：“你们开这样的训练班，这才是真正解放妇女呢！”
    同时，受训的助产人员获得了初步的生理、卫生知识，回去以后展开宣传，对破除农村中的封建迷信思想，改善妇婴卫生等起了很大作用。有的还以带徒弟、开妇女座谈会、作家庭访问等方式，推广了妇婴卫生教育，受到广大妇女的欢迎。如辽东省海伦县两期受训的接产妇一百七十人，回去之后，均以带徒弟为条件互相比赛争取模范。该县五个区的助产士配合受训接产妇，以村为单位举行每五天一次的卫生讲座，村里不愿意开会的妇女，也高兴来听讲。
    各地受训的接产人员，大部分是农村的旧接产妇，另有一部分妇女干部和青年妇女知识分子。训练时间一般为七天至半个月，主要授以新的接生方法、消毒方法，并打破迷信思想与纠正各种不卫生不科学的习惯；同时，教以保护母亲与婴孩的普通卫生常识。有的地区则办了比较长期的助产学校，训练专业助产人员，以她们为骨干去进行广泛的改造旧接产妇与推动妇婴卫生工作。
    经验证明：在改造旧接产妇时，首先最好选择成份较好，作风正派，年龄不太大的旧接产人员受训；动员其入学时要打通其思想，消除“怕受训后要交接产税”、“怕成为官家人”等顾虑，并适当照顾其生产。对妇女干部与青年妇女知识分子，则必须说服教育，使其明了接产工作的重要，消除其“接产是下流事”等错误认识。最好举出新旧接产法死亡数字的对比来进行教育。有的训练班发动旧接产妇统计自己过去接生小孩的死亡数字；或启发多生不育的母亲讲述过去自己婴孩死亡的事迹，都能激励受训人员的学习情绪。在教学上，要照顾受训人员的接受能力，最好多用讨论，启发学员——特别是有多年经验的旧接产妇——先讲，然后逐条研究，指出其可用的经验，批判其错误的方法；尤其要使她们在思想上重视消毒的重要，打破各种迷信传说。讲课时多用图画、模型与实物来帮助学员的了解与记忆。如有机会最好使学员能参观新法接生或作实习。医学上的名词术语应尽量少讲，改用学员们所熟习的通称。训练班结束时，要准备消毒药品与药棉等，动员学员买回去，以免学员回家后购买困难。此外，当地政府、机关要给受训回家的学员以支持帮助，解决其具体困难，使其做出良好的成绩，以影响群众，逐渐改进农村的妇婴卫生工作。
