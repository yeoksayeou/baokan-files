Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th: As the election day for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union draws nearer, the Soviet election campaign is nearing its end, and election preparations are intensifying. Currently, voters across the country are holding rallies with their representative candidates in a spirit of solidarity. Soviet leaders such as Shvernik, Shkiryatov, and Poskrebyshev, Soviet trade union leader Kuznetsov, Soviet Marshals Budyonny, Vasilevsky, and Sokolovsky, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Vavilov, and many other candidates have delivered speeches at rallies in several Soviet cities.

Kuznetsov delivered a speech to workers at the Red October Factory in Stalingrad, praising the restoration work in Stalingrad and discussing the world peace movement.

	The Ever-Growing Welfare of the Soviet People is Due to the Great Thought of Lenin and Stalin
	Leonov Delivers Speech to Voters

In the city of Belebei in the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, voters held a rally with their representative candidate, Poskrebyshev. Poskrebyshev analyzed the imperialists' plots of war preparation and plunder to the voters. The rally with voters and the famous Soviet writer Leonov was filled with enthusiasm. Leonov described his impressions of visiting several countries and participating in many peace conferences and meetings to the voters, saying: "Compared with the ever-increasing welfare of the Soviet people, the ulcers hidden under the superficial prosperity of capitalist society are becoming more and more obvious to all progressive mankind. The governments of capitalist countries are trying to rely on criminal acts to save their system from extinction. In a short period of history, we have transformed a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. We do not conceal these transformation methods, which are the Soviet state system, peaceful labor, and the socialist principles of production and distribution. Our people thank the great thoughts of Lenin and Stalin for all this. All honest people in the world understand this today."

Soviet voters demand that their representative candidates maintain constant contact with the voters, that they always and unwaveringly understand the policies of the Bolshevik Party, and that they spare no effort to fight for the further prosperity of the socialist country.

　　苏联各地选民与候选人团结一致举行集会
    选举准备工作正日趋紧张
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：由于苏联最高苏维埃选举日一天天迫近，苏联的选举运动已近尾声，而选举的准备工作，则日趋紧张。目前，全国各地的选民都在团结一致的精神下，和他们的代表候选人举行集会。苏联的领袖们如什维尔尼克，施基利亚托夫和波斯克列比舍维，苏联工会领袖库兹涅佐夫，苏联元帅布琼尼、华西列夫斯基和索科洛夫斯基，苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫及其他许多候选人，都已在苏联若干城市的集会上发表了演说。
    库兹涅佐夫在斯大林格勒红十月工厂对工人发表演说，赞扬斯大林格勒的恢复工作，并讲述了世界和平运动。
            苏联各族人民福利不断增长  应感谢列宁斯大林伟大思想
            李昂诺夫对选民发表演说
    在巴什基尔自治共和国的贝列贝伊城中，选民和他们的代表候选人波斯克列比舍维举行集会。波斯克列比舍维向选民分析了帝国主义的备战与掠夺阴谋。选民和苏联名作家李昂诺夫的集会上洋溢着热情，李昂诺夫对选民描述他访问过的若干国家，参加过多次和平大会与和平会议的印象称：“对照着苏联各族人民日益增长的福利，资本主义社会的用外表的繁荣掩饰起来的溃疡，越来越明显地呈现在全体进步人类的眼前了。资本主义国家的政府妄图仰仗犯罪作恶来挽救它们的制度免于灭亡。在短促的历史时间内，我们已把落后的农业国转变为强有力的工业国，我们并不隐秘这些转变方法，那就是苏维埃国家制度、和平劳动以及社会主义的生产与分配原则。我国人民为这一切而感谢列宁和斯大林的伟大思想。全世界一切诚实的老百姓今天都已经明白这个了。”
    苏联选民要求他们的代表候选人和选民经常保持联系，要求他们随时随地坚定不移地了解布尔什维克党的政策，并要求他们不遗余力地为社会主义国家更进一步的繁荣而斗争。
