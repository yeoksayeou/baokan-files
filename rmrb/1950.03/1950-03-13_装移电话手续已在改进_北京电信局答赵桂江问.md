　　Improvements Made in Telephone Installation Procedures: Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Responds to Zhao Guijiang's Inquiry

To the Editor:

    We saw the letter of opinion "Telephone Bureau Work Needs Improvement" from Comrade Zhao Guijiang of the News Photography Bureau Printing Factory, published on page six of your newspaper on March 9th. We are very grateful and pleased, and immediately conducted an inspection based on this fact. After our review, we believe that the handling of installation, removal, and relocation of telephones within the city requires procedures such as investigation, design, notification, fee collection, and construction. This process can prevent errors and confusion. This workflow is necessary, and every staff member must follow this system step by step. According to recent circumstances, cases similar to those reported are not common, because we are constantly striving to overcome delays that may occur during the process. However, it is still not enough to meet the needs of users, so the current workflow still needs to be studied and improved.

    Recently, we have been studying the experience of the Northeast Telecommunications Bureau and combining it with our own situation to reform the workflow system and procedures. After this reform, the handling procedures have been simplified significantly. We believe that similar incidents will not occur again in the future under normal circumstances.

    Currently, our procedure for handling telephone installation and relocation is as follows: After receiving the user's application (which can be sent to the Bureau by mail or applied for in person at the Changdian business office), we will send someone to survey the line at the location specified by the user. Based on the survey results, we will issue a payment order to the user. After we have surveyed the line, users should prepare the fee and pay it immediately at the Bureau's Changdian business office upon receiving the notification. The Bureau can then dispatch workers for installation. This cooperation will improve efficiency. If you have any questions, you can call "05" or 3-4200 or 3-0900 for inquiries.

### 装移电话手续已在改进  北京电信局答赵桂江问

　　装移电话手续已在改进  北京电信局答赵桂江问编辑同志：
    三月九日贵报第六版上披露了新闻摄影局印刷厂赵桂江同志《电话局工作要改进》的意见函，我们见到后非常感激和高兴，立刻根据这一事实进行了检查。经我们检讨的结果，认为本局在处理市内电话装、撤、移机等业务上需要经过调查、设计、通知、收费、施工等手续。这样在处理过程中可以避免发生错误和紊乱的现象。这种工作程序还是必要的，每一位经办人员都必需按照这一制度逐步进行。根据最近的情况，按装电话类似报载的情况还不多见，因为我们随时都在抓紧时间克服在处理过程中可能造成的延搁；虽然如此，但对用户的需要来说还是有些不够，所以现行的工作制度尚有加以研究改进的必要。
    最近我们已经进行研究，根据东北电信局的经验配合我们的情况，就工作制度、处理手续加以改革。经过这一改革，在处理手续上又简化了许多。我们相信今后在正常的状态下是不会再有类似的事件发生的。
    目前我们处理装移电话的手续是在接到用户的声请后（可以写信寄给本局，也可以亲身到厂甸营业处声请），即派人到用户指定的地点勘查线路，根据勘查的结果，开单送请用户缴费。用户在我们查线以后，应即准备费用，接到通知单立刻到本局厂甸营业处缴付，本局即可派工前往按装。如此两相配合可使效率更加提高。如遇有疑问，可随时拨叫“○五”或三·四二○○或三·○九○○号电话查问。
