A Brief Discussion on Opera Reform
    Ma Shaobo

    The key to completing the historical task of opera reform lies in relying on the masses of performers. Therefore, leading opera reform requires skillfully organizing and uniting the broad masses of performers to work together. The entire opera community is a revolutionary force for old dramas. We must select heroes from within this force, lead everyone, point out the direction, provide them with methods, and guide them to create things that can be tested by the masses. This way, with mass production and continuous revisions, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Opera reform work can then become a guided, popular mass movement. Otherwise, relying solely on a few individuals will not suffice.

    Mobilizing the opera community follows the same principles as general mass movements, primarily relying on awareness, not orders. Therefore, in leadership, we must avoid impatience and simplification, and instead, guide gradually, raise levels step by step, and be prepared to wait when necessary. On the ideological front, issuing orders is certainly an easy method, but not the best one. Many issues can be resolved within the movement itself.

    The central problem of old opera reform is the script. Both creation and revision are important, but currently, we should particularly focus on revision. Writing original scripts is excellent and should be encouraged and supported, but under current conditions, the production rate will not be very high. Compared to the actual needs, it will be a "drop in the bucket" and cannot solve the problem immediately. The public need is extremely urgent and should be met as much as possible. The facts do not allow us to engage in meticulous refinement. The requirements of opera reform are: first, to accept outstanding heritage; second, to eliminate feudal toxins. This is two sides of the same task. One-sidedly emphasizing one side or denying the other is wrong. The process of metabolism is long-term and extremely delicate and subtle. On the one hand, new dramas should draw nourishment from the artistic heritage; on the other hand, old scripts should be appropriately revised and retained as traditional performance programs. Both sides should advance in parallel, but to meet the current urgent needs, we must emphasize revision even more.

    Old operas that are harmful to the people, such as the worst old operas that promote feudal obscenity and poison like "Cui Ping Shan," "Killing the Son for Retribution," "Guo Ju Buries His Son," "The Great Coffin Splitting," etc., must be banned or revised. Only a small portion of old operas should be banned. Most should be revised. Currently, due to insufficient conditions, or a large portion are harmless or less harmful, we will not touch them for the time being, and revise the most needed ones first. The review standards need to be unified, but can be flexibly applied according to the actual situation in each region. Places or troupes that have already made progress should consolidate their existing progress and continue to advance, without looking backward. Some regions have banned too many operas, and some even adopt a method of banning performances on a rotating basis, which is inappropriate. For example, operas like "Battle of Wancheng" should not be banned. Simply modifying the erotic parts of the play would make it a relatively educational play. Some places even include "Meeting of Heroes," "Three Slaps on the Palm," "Fan Jiangguan," "Catching and Releasing at an Inn," "Peacock Flies Southeast," and other plays in the banned list, which is even more inappropriate. All plays that reflect historical situations and enlighten the audience's wisdom, even if they have some feudal elements, but give more wisdom and less feudal elements, such as "Meeting of Heroes," should not be overly demanding at present. Some believe that kneeling movements in the play are "feudal" and shouting "Oh Heavens" is "superstitious," which is not a historical materialist view. "Xiangmei Temple" was rejected because of some superstitious elements, resulting in the erasure of Huang Chao's uprising. In fact, plays like "Xiangmei Temple," "Wen Qiao Makes Trouble in the Government," and "Qingfeng Pavilion," can be made usable by slightly modifying the superstitious parts. There is no need to injure the whole for a small flaw.

    In order to promote and improve work, opera criticism should be enthusiastically carried out; however, the new things that are revised or created are still in a nascent state today. Works in the early stage of reform are inevitably rough and flawed; but this is not to be feared. Don't pour cold water on them, because the basic aspects are good. Although there are individual cases of very bad revisions, the general revisions are always better than no revisions. We should not worry about naivety, because naivety is much better than decay, because it will always grow. Old operas need to be revised, and new operas also need to be continuously revised. As long as we help patiently, overcome shortcomings, welcome progress, consolidate progress, and promote progress, even if the progress is small, we must affirm and promote it. Not to mention Shang Xiaoyun and Xiao Bai Yushuang's efforts in opera reform, Tan Fuying performed "The Fisherman's Hatred" and is rehearsing "Little Ao Mountain," and Xiao Cuihua performed "A Spirit Overwhelms Mountains and Rivers" and is rehearsing "Pine and Cypress Evergreen." Compared to the past, hasn't there been great progress? Creating an atmosphere of performing dramas that are beneficial to the people will also lay the cornerstone for "taking it to the next level" for the future of opera reform, which has a very good effect. Therefore, even small progress should be sincerely welcomed.

　　略谈戏曲改革
    马少波 	
    完成戏曲改革工作这一历史性的任务，主要在于依靠艺人群众。因此领导戏曲改革，必须善于组织与团结广大的艺人，一齐动手。全国戏曲界都是旧剧革命的队伍，从这里面选拔英雄，带领大家，指明方向，给他办法，有指导的搞出东西来，到群众中去考验。这样大量生产，不断修改，可以事半功倍。戏曲改革工作，才可成为有指导的群众普及运动。不然，只是依靠几个人是不行的。
    发动戏曲界群众和一般群众运动的规律是同样的，主要的是依靠觉悟，不是依靠命令。因此在领导工作上不能急燥，简单化，必须循循善诱，逐步提高，必要时还必须善于等待。在思想战线上，下命令究竟是容易的办法，而不是最好的办法。有好些问题完全可以在运动中解决的。
    旧剧改革的中心问题是剧本问题。创作和修改都很重要，但目前应特别着重于修改。自己编是很好的，应该鼓励扶助；但以目前条件，生产率不会太高，与现实需要相比，“杯水车薪”，不能立刻解决问题。群众需要极为迫切，应想法满足，事实不允许我们精雕细琢。戏曲改革的要求：一是接受优秀遗产；一是消灭封建毒素。这是一个任务的两面。片面的强调那一面；或者否定那一面，都是错误的。新陈代谢的过程是长期的，而又是极其细致微妙。一方面创作新剧从艺术遗产中吸取养料，另一方面将旧剧本适当地加以修改作为传统的演出节目保留下来，这样双方并进，而为适应目前迫切需要，又必须更着重修改。
    对于人民有害的旧剧，如提倡封建淫毒的“翠屏山”“杀子报”“郭巨埋儿”“大劈棺”等等最坏的旧剧，必须加以禁止或修改。禁演的只是旧剧中的一小部分。大部分要改，目前因条件不足或者还有一大部分无害或害少的暂时不去动它，尽最需要改的先改。审查标准需要统一，但可根据各地实际情况而灵活运用。已经前进一步的地方或剧团，要巩固既有进步，继续进步，不要向后看齐；有的地区禁剧过多，甚至有的采用按期禁演的办法，是不妥的。例如“战宛城”一类的戏，不应禁演，只消把剧中色情部分修改一下，就是一出较有教育意义的戏了，有的地方甚至连“群英会”“三击掌”“樊江关”“捉放宿店”“孔雀东南飞”等剧也在禁例，更为不妥。凡是反映历史情况，启发观众智慧的剧，虽然有些封建成份，但是给人的智慧多，封建成份少，如“群英会”等，目前不必苛求，有的认为剧中有跪拜的动作是“封建”，喊声“天哪”是“迷信”，这不是历史唯物主义的看法。“祥梅寺”因有些迷信成份而被否定，结果把黄巢起义也勾销了。其实像“祥梅寺”“问樵闹府”“青风亭”一类的戏，把迷信部分稍加修改就是可用的戏，不必因小疵而伤大体。
    为了推动和提高工作，应该热烈开展戏曲批评；不过修改或创作的新东西，今天还是一种萌芽状态，改革初期的作品，粗糙，有缺点，都是难免的；但是这不足害怕，不要泼冷水，因为基本方面是好的，虽然也有个别的改的很糟，但是一般的改的总比不改的要好，我们不要耽心幼稚，幼稚比腐朽要好的多，因为它总是要成长起来的。旧戏要改，新戏也要不断的改，只要我们以耐心帮助，克服缺点，欢迎进步的态度，巩固进步，推动进步，那怕进步是微小的，也要肯定和发扬它；尚小云、筱白玉霜在戏曲改革上的努力不用说，谭富英演出了“渔夫恨”，又在排“小鳌山”，小翠花演出了“气盖山河”，又在排演“松柏长青”，比起过去，不也有了很大的进步么？造成演对人民有益的戏剧的风气，对于戏曲改革的将来也打下“更上一层楼”的基石，是有着很好的作用的。所以那怕是微小的进步，也应该表示诚挚的欢迎。
