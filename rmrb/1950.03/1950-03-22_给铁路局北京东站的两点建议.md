　　Two Suggestions for the Beijing East Railway Station from the Railway Bureau
　　I. In addition to announcing train numbers and times over the loudspeaker in the waiting room, some music and songs should be added.
　　II. Since sleeper tickets are stipulated to be sold only three hours before departure, on the evening of February 27th, I was queuing the entire time, with ten people in front of me. When it was my turn, I was told, "The tickets are sold out." I think that even though there are few third-class sleeper berths, there are definitely more than ten third-class sleeper berths on a train. When were the rest of those tickets sold? I hope that the ticket selling time will be strictly adhered to in the future. (Feng Xinmin, Music Department, Normal University)

　　给铁路局北京东站的两点建议
    一、候车室内除去在扩音机内报告车次时间外，应添些音乐歌曲等。
    二、睡铺票既然规定一律在开车前三小时始售，但是在二月二十七日晚，我一直在排着队，我的前面排着十个人，结果到我这里说“票已没有了”。我觉得三等睡铺虽然少，但是一列车的三等睡铺绝不止十个，其余的那些张是在什么时候卖了？希望以后严格遵守卖票时间。（师大音乐系  冯信民）
