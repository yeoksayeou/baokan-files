Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th. (TASS Moscow, June 6th) Soviet voters have been holding meetings in various constituencies with candidates for the Supreme Soviet for several days. These meetings prove the indestructible unity of the Soviet people and the Bolshevik Party.

Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Pervukhin and Yefremov, Soviet Marshal Malinovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Zone of Germany, Army General Chuikov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus, Gusarov, and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, Bagirov, all delivered speeches at the preliminary election meetings. Lysenko, President of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said at a farmers' rally in the Odessa region: "There is nothing happier than winning the trust of the Soviet people. I guarantee to contribute all my strength to the Party of Lenin and Stalin. In our country, the development of the most progressive Michurin agricultural science and biology is coordinated with practical socialist agriculture, with the aim of reducing the labor of collective farmers and state farm workers, and enabling the forces of nature to be utilized by our agriculture."
    
    Fadeyev's Speech Endorses the Sino-Soviet Treaty

In the Chkalov region, the famous Soviet writer Fadeyev said to the voters in his speech: "The Soviet people, collective farmers, and intellectuals are working gloriously, and the international status of the Soviet Union has also been greatly consolidated. The Soviet Union has gained the support of the People's Democratic countries that have embarked on the road of socialist construction and the support of all progressive mankind. The Soviet state has concluded a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with the victorious People's China, which has a population of nearly 500 million. Concluding a treaty with People's China is one of the most extraordinary historical events. The existence of a democratic, peace-loving Germany and its friendship with the Soviet Union constitute a reliable guarantee for peace in Europe."

In Putivl, an ancient city north of Kharkov, voters warmly welcomed Kovpak, a hero of the Patriotic War and an outstanding politician from a poor peasant background. During the German fascist occupation, the guerrillas led by Kovpak were active from Putivl to the Carpathian Mountains. His bravery won the trust and support of the voters.

In Riga, the capital of the Latvian Republic, the famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg met with voters. As the voters pointed out at the meeting, Ehrenburg's name is well known and loved by all those who love peace. The voters will be happy to elect this person who has always served the people with his pen.

　　苏各地选民与候选人连日集会
    显示人民与党坚强团结
    李森科向选民讲演保证对党贡献全力
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联选民连日在各选区与最高苏维埃候选人举行会议，这些会议证明了苏联人民与布尔什维克党的不可摧毁的团结。
    苏联部长会议副主席别尔乌辛和叶非列莫夫、苏联元帅马林诺夫斯基、德境苏占区总司令陆军上将崔可夫、白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会书记古沙罗夫，阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会书记巴吉罗夫等均在预选会议上发表了演讲。全苏农业科学院院长李森科在敖德萨州的农民集会上演讲称：“再没有什么比赢得苏维埃人民的信任更幸福的了。我保证以全力贡献给列宁、斯大林党。在我国，最进步的米丘林农业学与生物学的发展，是实际和社会主义农业相配合的，其目的在减轻集体农民与国家农场工人的劳动，使自然力量能为我国农业所利用。”
            法捷耶夫演讲  拥护中苏缔约
    在契卡洛夫州，苏联著名作家法捷耶夫向选民演说称：“苏维埃人民、集体农民和知识分子光荣地工作着，苏联的国际地位也已大大地巩固了。苏联获得了业已走上社会主义建设道路的人民民主国家的支持和全体进步人类的支持。苏维埃国家已和拥有将近五亿人口的、胜利的人民中国缔结了友好同盟互助条约，与人民中国缔结条约，乃是最不平常的历史事件之一。民主的爱好和平的德国之存在和它与苏联的友谊，构成了欧洲和平的可靠保证。”
    在哈尔科夫以北的古城普蒂夫尔选民们在会议上热烈欢迎爱国战争的英雄、贫农出身的杰出政治家科夫巴克。在德国法西斯占领期间，科夫巴克率领的游击队活跃在普蒂夫尔到喀尔巴阡山，他的英勇获得了选民的信任与拥护。
    在拉脱维亚共和国的首都——里加，苏联名作家爱伦堡和选民们见面。正如选民们在会议上所指出的，爱伦堡的名字为一切爱好和平事业的人们所熟知和爱戴，选民将高兴地选举这位一直用笔枪为人民服务的人。
