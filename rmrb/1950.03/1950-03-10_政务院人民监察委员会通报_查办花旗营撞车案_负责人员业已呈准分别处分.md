　　People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council Issues Notice
    Investigation and Handling of the Huqiying Train Collision Case
    Responsible Personnel Have Been Approved for Disciplinary Action
    [Xinhua News Agency News] The People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council recently issued a notice on the handling of the Huqiying Station train collision on the Jinpu Railway line of the Jinan Railway Bureau. The full text is as follows:

            I. Losses and Aftermath of the Train Collision:

    On January 23 of this year, military train No. 2404 heading north from Pukou collided head-on at 5:06 AM with freight train No. 301 heading south and stopped at Huqiying Station. Six cars overturned, the locomotive was slightly damaged, and 16 cadres and students from the Communications Detachment of the Second Field Army died and 46 were injured (10 of whom were seriously injured). The delay in operation time was 12 hours and 29 minutes.

    After the collision, the Jinan Railway Bureau and Bengbu Sub-Bureau sent rescue trains, doctors, and responsible cadres to the scene for rescue. The injured were sent to Puzhen Hospital for treatment. The deceased were placed in coffins, a memorial service was held, and they were buried on the spot. Bereaved family members were given condolences and the injured were comforted. General Su Yu of the East China Military Region, the Political Department and Headquarters of the Third Field Army, the Nanjing Municipal Government, the Nanjing worker and student representatives, the Ministry of Railways, the Jinan Railway Bureau, and the supervision team of the Supervisory Committee visited the hospital to express their condolences.

            II. Causes of the Incident:

    A. Direct Causes:

    (1) The main cause of this incident was that switchman Wang Jinfa of the station disobeyed orders and switched the track incorrectly. After the previous train passed, he telephoned the deputy station master on duty, Zhou Zhenqing, to ask if No. 301 would depart. Because Zhou had not received an order from the dispatcher, he did not give a clear answer. Wang Jinfa then arbitrarily opened one track (the track for No. 301 to stop on) to wait for No. 301 to depart. Soon after, Deputy Station Master Zhou received an order to meet train No. 2404 again and immediately notified Wang Jinfa by telephone, but Wang did not switch the track back to the second track in the correct position. Then station worker Jin Bingyuan verbally told Wang Jinfa that train No. 2404 would meet again, but Wang only cared about warming himself by the fire and never switched the track back, which led to this serious train collision. After train No. 2404 entered one track, stoker Wang Congyun fortunately noticed a train opposite and told the driver to apply the emergency brake, otherwise the damage would have been even more serious.

    (2) Station worker Jin Bingyuan, when using hand signals to guide train No. 2404, although he notified Wang Jinfa that the trains would meet again, he did not confirm the sign after passing the switch and blindly led the train into the station.

    (3) Deputy Station Master Zhou Zhenqing, when receiving the order that train No. 2404 had departed from Puzhen, was only busy using the interlocking device to get the token and did not personally confirm the switch sign. When he could not get the token, he sent Yao Bingming to take over the train, but did not clearly instruct him to confirm the switch sign, which was also an important cause of the train collision.

    (4) Station worker Yao Bingming, who replaced Deputy Station Master Zhou to take over the train, could have quickly confirmed the sign and discovered that the switch sign was wrong, and corrected it in time. Because the worker was careless in his duty, he did not discover that the switch was wrong until he walked onto the platform, but it was too late.

            Workers' Disobedience, Irresponsibility and Bureaucratic Style are the Causes of the Disaster

    B. Indirect Causes:

    (1) Huqiying Station Master Shi Rongle was usually irresponsible in his work. He knew that Jin Bingyuan was not qualified to perform hand signal work, but he agreed to employ him. He did not actively supervise and urge the extension of the station track and the repair of the signal machine. He opposed political study and was not united with the deputy station master, so he did not inspect the work of Zhou Zhenqing's shift. After the train collision, he did not make a self-criticism, but instead gloated, saying, "This is the result of Deputy Station Master Zhou leading political study."

    (2) Wang Yan and Zhang Bin, the station masters on duty before and after the Pukou car allocation, were irresponsible in their work. When Wang Yan was on duty, the dispatcher ordered No. 2404 to be prepared before 18:00 on the 22nd, but the worker neither checked the vehicles nor requested the dispatcher to allocate vehicles when he found that No. 2404 did not have enough vehicles, and did not allocate the existing 35 vehicles. He passed the task to Zhang Bin, delaying the departure time of No. 2404. After Zhang Bin took over the shift, he knew that there were still six vehicles missing, but he did not actively find a way, and it was not until 1:15 AM on the 23rd that he hastily completed the assembly. When assembling the train, he did not consider the safety of long-distance travel and mixed large and small cars, which aggravated the damage during the collision.

    (3) Li Wenbin, the station master on duty in Puzhen, failed to implement the bureau's order for advance notice of train meetings at previous stations. Wang Zhen, the dispatcher of the Bengbu Dispatching Office, did not pay enough attention to military transport and did not notify the Puzhen station master to inform the train crew of the meeting at Huqiying. Wang Tingzhen, the deputy director of the dispatching office, emphasized trouble and did not implement the bureau's order for advance notice of train meetings.

    (4) Wang Xiaoyi, the chief of the Transportation Section, had a serious bureaucratic style in his leadership of the stations. He concealed information from his superiors and protected his subordinates, causing accidents to occur continuously in the section. Within a few days after the Huqiying train collision, a rear-end collision occurred between train No. 121 and a small tram between Dongge and Huqiying. Wang Hongzhi, the chief of the Transportation Section of the Bengbu Sub-Bureau, usually lacked supervision and inspection of the implementation of regulations by the stations.

    (5) Tan Guisen, the chief of the Puzhen Engineering Section, had a bureaucratic style. He failed to supervise and complete the track extension project in time, which could have been completed with ballast. When the track was extended, the telecommunications section was notified to move the signals, but it was not notified to restore them when the track was restored. Li Guangde, the supervisor of Puzhen, presided over the track extension project, and did not actively strive for completion even though there were conditions. He did not inform the telecommunications section to restore the signals when the track was restored, which was also related to the train collision.

    (6) Fang Fuyi, a line worker at Huqiying, was irresponsible for maintaining telecommunications. Deputy Station Master Zhou called him three times when the interlocking device malfunctioned, but he disobeyed the order and did not come. Zhai Honglu, the chief of the Signal Section of the Bengbu Telecommunications Section, did not actively study and solve the problem of subordinates asking for instructions to restore the interlocking station protection signal machine, and delayed it until after the incident, when it was restored. This affected traffic safety. Yu Zhonghao, the supervisor of the Puzhen Sub-station, did not execute the order to weld the wires, which was related to the failure of the interlocking device this time.

            Many Important Shortcomings Still Exist in the Management Work of the Jinan Railway Bureau

    III. Leadership Issues:

    In the past year, the Jinan Railway Bureau has completed the arduous task of repairing railways and military transportation under very difficult conditions, and there have been many improvements in management. However, according to the materials investigated by the committee this time, the bureau still has many important shortcomings in management that need to be resolved urgently.

    A. Insufficient attention is paid to the transportation work of small stations. The small stations lack core leadership and the situation is not well understood. Due to the poor foundation, train collisions, rollovers, and derailments occur continuously at the small stations. Although a campaign to eliminate accidents has been launched, there has been little progress until now (for example, Pukou Station had seven major accidents in January. A train collision occurred at Xinpu Station on September 18 last year; a train derailed at Danzi Station on November 18; another train collision occurred at Longwangmiao on the 19th; two trains nearly collided at Guandian on December 2; a train collision occurred at Jiulonggang on the 8th; on January 28, two trains nearly collided head-on at Lijiazhuang Station due to an incorrectly switched track; a similar accident occurred at Liuquan Station on the 30th; and a small tram was damaged between Huqiying and Dongge on the 31st, etc.).

    B. Insufficient work is being done to unite and transform retained employees. Before the unified management of the Jinan Railway Bureau, some places were unable to start with mobilizing employees to review their thinking and work and improve their political awareness and work efficiency. Instead, they adopted the methods of class struggle in the countryside to handle employee relations, creating disunity among employees. The Jinan Railway Bureau focuses too much on the shortcomings of retained employees and the work of actively transforming them is poor. Retained employees generally show that they are perfunctory in their work and emotionally opposed to veteran cadres. In addition to the many irresponsible phenomena mentioned above, for example, the station master of Dongge telegraphed Wuyi Station after the Huqiying accident, saying: "There has been a train collision at Huqiying, and the station master on duty is a Communist Party member!" For another example, when the Bengbu Sub-Bureau held a station master meeting to study the elimination of accidents and improvement of transportation management, most of the station masters had many concerns, remained silent, and made very few self-criticisms and suggestions for improvement. Senior employees at Pukou Station are irresponsible in their work, the deputy station master on duty for car allocation sleeps with the workers, and the employees do not study, transmit, or handle bureau orders seriously.

    C. New unified regulations have not been formulated, and strict supervision and inspection of the serious implementation of the old regulations in various places has not been carried out. Some temporary regulations are also unclear, which has caused confusion and can easily lead to accidents. For example, after the Longwangmiao train collision, the Jinan Railway Bureau issued Order No. 5404: "Operational personnel have the obligation to use all opportunities and time that do not affect train operation to transmit orders or announcements, and this obligation should be regarded as a responsibility." A joint letter from the Transportation Department and the Locomotive Department of the Jinan Railway Bureau on July 16 last year stated: "In order to facilitate use along the way, large and small vehicles with air pipes can be mixed, and should be handled in accordance with the distance to the arrival station and the location of the switch tracks to be picked up and dropped off." The above wording is very vague and can be used as an excuse by irresponsible people. Secondly, when implementing the reward and punishment system, it failed to mobilize the broad masses of employees to conduct in-depth reviews and corrections in good coordination with the business and accidents. Moreover, some felt that "there are few rewards and many punishments," and some believed that "light rewards and not heavy punishments are like waste," which had little effect on stimulating work efficiency, and labor discipline was not well established. Furthermore, working hours do not take fatigue into account. Because the Pubeng section implements a two-shift system, each shift works continuously for 24 hours, plus half an hour for roll call and two hours for study, and there are many vehicles coming and going, it is difficult to rest during work, which causes excessive fatigue.

    D. The Communist Party organizations, trade union organizations, and youth league organizations have not been able to work under the unified goal of ensuring the completion of transportation tasks, and the coordination of work between various business departments is not close enough, and this phenomenon also exists in the campaign to eliminate accidents.

    E. The principles of fast, safe, and accurate train operation cannot be specifically applied in various regions. In the area under the jurisdiction of the Bengbu Sub-Bureau, the equipment is poor and the organization and awareness of the employees are not high enough. Emphasis is placed on speed, while safety is ignored.

    F. Due to difficult material conditions, the station and locomotive equipment are poor, and the transportation tasks are heavy, resulting in vehicle congestion, which is prone to accidents. For example, train No. 2404 had no headlights, and train No. 301 had no dimming device; within the jurisdiction of the Bengbu Sub-Bureau, each small station generally has only two tracks, making it difficult to pass trains, and the signal machines at each station are mostly incomplete, resulting in vehicle congestion and road blockages.

    IV. Proposed Disciplinary Actions:

    Based on the understanding and analysis of the incident, in order to educate all employees and improve work, the following personnel will be given the following treatment:

    A. The following relevant personnel have been submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and will be given disciplinary action by official order.

    (1) Wang Jinfa, Zhou Zhenqing, Shi Rongle, Jin Bingyuan, and Yao Bingming will all be dismissed from their positions and sent to judicial organs for legal punishment.

    (2) In addition to the approval of the Ministry of Railways to record demerits once for Chen Dafan, Director of the Jinan Railway Administration, Gui Peng, Political Commissar, Niu Zhu, Director of the Transportation Department, and Zhao Guodong, Director of the Bengbu Sub-Bureau, Zhao Huanwen, Deputy Director of the Jinan Railway Bureau, should also be recorded demerits once.

    (3) Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan and Deputy Minister Lü Zhengcao have made significant achievements in restoring railway and transportation work over the past year. After this incident occurred, they immediately took effective measures and made deep self-criticisms, valued responsibility, and requested disciplinary action on their own initiative. It was decided to give Minister Teng and Deputy Minister Lü a criticism. Zhen Tao, Deputy Director of the First Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who directly manages transportation business, was given a warning.

    B. The following personnel have been submitted to the Government Administration Council to order the Ministry of Railways to impose appropriate disciplinary actions based on the severity of the fault.

    Wang Xiaoyi, Wang Hongzhi, Wang Yan, Zhang Bin, Wang Zhen, Wang Tingzhen, Li Wenbin, Zhai Honglu, Yu Zhonghao, Fang Fuyi, Tan Guisen, Li Guangde.

    C. Stoker Wang Congyun was responsible in his work. He acted decisively during the Longwangmiao train collision. He discovered the accident early this time, which reduced the damage of the accident. It is recommended that the Ministry of Railways give him an appropriate reward.

　　政务院人民监察委员会通报
    查办花旗营撞车案
    负责人员业已呈准分别处分
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会顷发出处理济南铁路局津浦线花旗营站撞车事件通报，全文如下：
            一、撞车事件损失及善后情形：
    本年一月二十三日，由浦口北上之二四○四次军车，于五点零六分与停在花旗营站之三○一次南下货车发生正面冲突。翻车六辆，机车稍有损坏，二野军大电讯支队干部及学员死十六人，伤四十六人（其中重伤十人）。延误运行时间十二时二十九分。
    撞车后济南路局及蚌埠分局即先后派救援列车、医生和负责干部前往营救。伤员送往浦镇医院治疗，死者用棺木成殓，举行追悼，就地葬埋，并抚恤烈属，慰问伤员。华东军区粟裕将军、三野政治部、司令部、南京市府、二野驻宁办事处、南京工人学生代表、铁道部、济南路局、监察委员会监察小组等，先后前往医院慰问。
            二、事件原因：
    甲、直接原因：
    （１）此次事件主要为该站转辙工王金发不听命令，将道岔扳错所致。该员于前次列车通过后，曾电话问值班副站长周祯清三○一次是否开车，周因没接到调度所之命令，未明确答复。王金发即擅将一股道（即通三○一次停车之道）开通，等候三○一次车开出。不久周副站长接到再会二四○四次车的命令，即电话通知该员，但王并未将道岔扳回二股正位。继由站员金炳元以口头告诉王金发再会二四○四次车，王只顾烤火，始终未将道岔扳回，因此发生此严重撞车事件。当二四○四次车进入一股道后，幸由司炉王从云发觉对面有车，即告司机下死闸，否则损伤更严重。
    （２）站员金炳元，前往用手信号引二四○四次车时，虽曾通知王金发再会车，但经过转辙器未确认标志，亦未问王金发是否将道岔扳正，竟盲目引车进站。
    （３）值班副站长周祯清，当接到二四○四次车由浦镇开出之命令后，只忙于用闭塞器要牌，未亲去确认转辙器标志，于要牌不得时，曾派姚炳明代替接车，但未明确嘱咐确认转辙器标志，亦为撞车事件之重要原因。
    （４）站员姚炳明代替周副站长接车，若迅速确认标志，发觉转辙器标志错误，亦能即时纠正，因该员马虎职守，直至走上月台，始发现道岔不对，为时已晚。
            工作人员不听命令不负责任和官僚主义作风是肇祸原因
    乙、间接原因
    （１）花旗营站长施荣乐，平时工作不负责任，明知金炳元不能担任手讯号工作，又同意任用。对该站延长股道，修复信号机，均不积极督催。反对政治学习，与副站长闹不团结，因而对周祯清班工作不加检查。撞车事件发生后，不作自我检讨，反而幸灾乐祸，说：“这是周副站长领导政治学习的结果”。
    （２）浦口配车前后值班站长王彦、张滨，工作不负责任。王彦值班时，调度所命令二十二日十八点前将二四○四次编好，但该员既不清查车辆，在发现二四○四次车辆不够时，亦未及时请调度所调拨车辆，现有三十五辆亦不编配，即将任务推交张滨，延缓了二四○四次开出时间，张滨接班后知尚差车六辆，也不积极设法，直迟至二十三日一时十五分乃草率编成。在编车时未考虑长途行车安全，竟将大小车混合编挂，加重撞车时损伤恶果。
    （３）浦镇值班站长李文斌，未执行前站会车预告之局令。蚌埠调度所调度员王震，对军运重视不够，亦未通知浦镇站长转告乘务员在花旗营会车。该调度所副主任王庭珍，强调麻烦，不执行会车预告之局令。
    （４）车务段长王肖沂，对各站的领导存在着严重的官僚主义作风，对上级隐瞒，对下级包庇，致令该段事故不断发生。花旗营撞车后不数日，又在东葛花旗营间，发生一二一次车与小电车追撞事件。蚌埠分局运输科长王洪志，平时对各站执行规章缺乏督促检查。
    （５）浦镇工务段长檀桂森，有官僚主义作风，对有石碴能完成之延长股道工程，未督促及时完成。延长股道时已通知电务段移动号志，股道复原未再通知其恢复。浦镇监工员李广德主持延长股道工程，虽有条件亦未主动争取完成。股道复员，又不告知电务段恢复号志，亦与撞车事件有关。
    （６）花旗营帮线匠方福义对维护电讯不负责任。周副站长于闭塞器发生故障时，三次呼唤，违命不到。蚌埠电务段号志股长翟鸿陆，对下级请示恢复连锁护站信号机问题，不积极研究解决，拖延至事件发生后，始修复。影响行车安全。浦镇分驻所监工员俞忠浩，不执行电线焊接命令，对此次闭塞器故障有关。
            济南路局的管理工作仍存在许多重要缺点
    三、领导上的问题：
    一年来济南路局在各种条件十分困难的情况下，完成了抢修铁路与军事运输之艰巨任务，管理上亦有很多改进。但根据这次本委调查的材料看，该局在管理上至今仍存在许多急待解决的重要缺点。
    甲、对小站运输工作重视不够。各小站既缺乏核心领导，情况亦多不了解，由于基础较差，各小站不断发生撞车、翻车、脱线等事故，虽布置过消灭事故运动，但直到现在进步不大（如浦口站一月份即发生七件重大事故。去年九月十八日发生新浦站撞车；十一月十八日担子站发生列车脱线；十九日又发生龙王庙撞车；十二月二日管店两列车险遭冲突；八日九龙岗列车冲突；一月二十八日李家庄站又因扳错道岔，两列车险遭正面冲突；三十日柳泉站又发生类似事故；三十一日在花旗营、东葛间撞坏小电车等）。
    乙、对留用职员的团结改造工作做的不够。济南路局统一管理前，有些地方不能够很好的从发动职工检讨思想与工作，提高政治觉悟与工作效率着手，反而采取农村阶级斗争的办法，处理职工关系，造成职工不团结的现象。济南路局对留用职员，多看其缺点，积极改造工作差。留用职员普遍表现工作敷衍塞责，情感上和老干部对立，除前述许多不负责现象外，如东葛站长在花旗营事故发生后，电告乌衣站称：“花旗营撞车了，值班站长是共产党员啊！”再如蚌埠分局召开站长会议，研究消灭事故改善运输管理，多数站长顾虑颇多，表示沉默，毫无自我检讨，提出改进办法很少。浦口站高级职员工作不负责任，配车值班副站长与工人商同睡觉，职员对局令不研究、不传达、处理表现应付。
    丙、新的统一的规章未制定，亦未严格督促检查各地认真执行旧规章，有些临时规章亦欠明确，因此造成混乱，容易发生事故。如龙王庙撞车事件后，济南路局颁布五四○四号命令：“运转有关人员有利用一切不致影响列车运行之机会与时间传达命令或预告之义务，此义务应视同责任。”济南局运务处和机务处去年七月十六日联函称：“为了便于沿途挂用，有风管之大小型车辆，可以混挂，并应按照到达站之远近及摘送岔道之位置顺序办理之。”上列语意均十分含糊，为不负责任者所借口。其次在执行奖惩制度时，未能发动广大员工，将业务及事故很好配合，进行深入的检讨纠正，而且有的感觉“奖少罚多”，有的认为“奖轻罚不重形同浪费”，对刺激工作效率作用不大，劳动纪律未能很好建立。再则工作时间亦未照顾疲劳，由于浦蚌段施行两班制，每班连续工作二十四小时，再加半小时点名，两小时学习，来往车辆又多，工作中很难休息，因此造成过度疲劳。
    丁、共产党组织、工会组织、青年团组织与行政管理机关未能在保证运输任务完成的统一目标下进行工作，各业务部门工作之配合亦不够密切，在消灭事故运动中亦有此现象。
    戊、行车迅速、安全、准确原则，各地区不能具体运用。蚌埠分局辖区内，设备较差，员工组织性与觉悟性亦不够高，强调迅速，而忽视安全。
    己、由于物资条件困难，车站与机车设备均差，加之运输任务繁重，车辆拥挤，易于发生事故。如二四○四次列车无头灯，三○一次列车无减光器；蚌埠分局管辖内，各小站一般地均只有两股道，错车困难，各站讯号机设置多不齐全，致形成车辆拥挤，道路堵塞。
    四、议处意见：
    根据事件情况的了解与分析，为了教育全体职工，改进工作，对下列人员，分别予以如下之处理：
    甲、下列有关人员已呈准政务院，予以明令处分。
    （１）王金发、周祯清、施荣乐、金炳元、姚炳明五人均予以撤职、送司法机关依法惩办。
    （２）除追认铁道部给济南铁路管理局局长陈大凡，政委桂蓬，运务处长牛渚、蚌埠分局局长赵国栋各记大过一次之处分外，济南路局副局长赵焕文亦应记大过一次。
    （３）铁道部部长滕代远，副部长吕正操等一年来在恢复铁路及运转工作上有显著成绩。此次事件发生后，立即采取有效措施，并作深刻的自我检讨，重视责任，自请处分，决定予滕部长、吕副部长以批评处分。直接管理运输业务之铁道部第一运输局副局长甄陶，予以警告处分。
    乙、下列人员已呈准政务院饬令铁道部分别过失轻重，酌予适当之处分。
    王肖沂、王洪志、王彦、张滨、王震、王庭珍、李文斌、翟鸿陆、俞忠浩、方福义、檀桂森、李广德。
    丙、司炉王从云，工作负责，前在龙王庙撞车时，行动机警，本次撞车，及早发现，使事故损害得以减轻，建议铁道部酌予奖励。
