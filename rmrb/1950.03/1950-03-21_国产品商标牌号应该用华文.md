　　Domestic Brand Names Should Use Chinese Characters
    I saw an advertisement on page six of the People's Daily from the joint state-private owned Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. I noticed that most of the brand names of their cigarettes are in English, so I would like to offer a small suggestion regarding this. I remember that as far back as March or April of last year, the government issued an order requiring that all trademarks and brand names of state-owned enterprises must be in Chinese. The company's advertisement also contains the phrase "Smoking famous domestic cigarettes is supporting the development of people's enterprises"; since they are domestic cigarettes, why not use our Chinese characters? Therefore, I sincerely hope that all of our domestic products (not just this company, there are many others like this), except for export goods, should use Chinese characters entirely for their trademarks, which would be more appropriate.

　　国产品商标牌号应该用华文
    我看到人民日报第六版的广告里有一家公私合营的南洋兄弟烟草公司的广告，我看到他们所出产的香烟的牌子大部分用的是英文，所以我想对这一点提出一个小意见。记得远在上年三四月间政府曾经颁布过一个命令，所有一切公营企业的商标、牌号，均须用华文。该公司在广告中亦有“爱吸国产名烟就是支持人民企业的发展”等语；既是国产纸烟，为什么不用我们中国文字呢？因此，我甚希望凡是我们的国产品（不光是这一家还有很多的也是这样），除出口货以外，仍应以完全用中国的文字做商标较为合宜。
