To the Editor:

    Regarding the letter from reader Lu Xizhi published on page six of your newspaper on the 21st: concerning the opinions that private radio stations should examine their own programs, our station raised this for discussion in a business meeting, and believes that the point made refers to our station. Mr. Lu pointed out that this month our station broadcast "Severing the Lineage" twice, and that its content contained feudal superstitious elements, which is completely correct. Our station neglected a serious examination of the program content, resulting in a bad impression on the audience. We should strengthen the ties with our fellow actors and actresses in the future, and work hard to improve the content of our programs. At the same time, we hope the masses will give us more criticism and help.

　　华声广播电台接受听众批评编辑同志：
    你报二十一日第六版登载读者陆希治先生来函：关于私营电台应检查自己节目的意见，我台曾在业务会中提出检讨，认为所指确系我台。陆先生所指本月我台放过两次《断后》内容含有封建迷信成分的意见，完全正确。我台疏忽了对节目内容的认真检查，以致给予听众恶劣印象。我们今后应加强与演员同志间的连系，努力改善节目内容。同时希望群众给我们更多的批评和帮助。北京华声广播电台
