Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to today's Worker's Daily, since the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Administration launched the rationalization proposal campaign, it has received twenty major and minor rationalization proposals related to improving production efficiency, extending locomotive lifespan, and safety and hygiene in three months. After being adopted and implemented by the administrative organization, production work has been greatly improved. Li Shengyan, the foreman of the mechanical group, created a grinder for locomotive cylinders and steam chests, greatly improving the efficiency of repairing cylinder and steam chest leaks. In the past, when cylinders and steam chests needed repair, they had to be sent to a railway factory, which took about two months. Calculating with each locomotive hauling more than forty carriages and traveling an average of 355 kilometers per day, the loss was enormous in two months. After Li Shengyan created the new tool, the locomotive depot can repair it itself, and it only takes four days. Gao Zhensheng, the foreman of the foundry, created a method of refining copper by using a cupola furnace in combination with a copper melting furnace, increasing the amount of copper refined from 600 kilograms per day to 1,500 kilograms, meeting and exceeding the needs of the locomotive depot. Moreover, the cost per furnace is reduced by 5.5 million yuan compared to the past. In terms of improving efficiency, Meng Xianwu's newly invented automatic pipe cutting machine is twenty times more efficient than manual labor. The emphasis placed on the rationalization proposal movement by the administrative, Communist Party branch, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot is one of the important reasons for the development of the movement. The depot chief and the trade union standing committee jointly organized a rationalization proposal committee, with the depot chief serving as the chairman and the trade union production committee member specifically in charge of collecting rationalization proposals. The depot chief is responsible for helping workers overcome difficulties encountered when submitting rationalization proposals. The Communist Party branch and the Communist Youth League also mobilized Party members and League members to actively participate in this movement. Among the workers who put forward rationalization proposals, Party members and League members account for about half.

The Worker's Daily published an editorial today on the promotion of rationalization proposals, pointing out that rationalization proposals are still a new issue for general factories and enterprises in Guannei (areas inside the Shanhaiguan Pass), and there is a lack of experience. However, judging from the initial results of the rationalization proposal movement in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, it has proved that under the new democratic regime led by the working class, the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses is a great and infinite potential force. The problem lies only in how administrative managers and trade union workers can discover and utilize it. The editorial called on administrative and trade union personnel to listen to the opinions of the masses, go deep into the working masses, lead them to study production problems, proceed from reality, and encourage them to put forward various suggestions for improving and increasing production. These suggestions, regardless of size, should be treated with a welcoming, serious, and responsible attitude, and studied. Correct ones should be implemented, and incorrect ones or those that are difficult to implement for the time being should be explained, and should not be left aside. All rational suggestions that have been adopted and are effective should be given not only honorary commendation and awards, but also material rewards that are commensurate with the actual value of their suggestions. The editorial pointed out that the rationalization proposal movement in the industrial departments of Northeast China, under the direct influence and help of advanced Soviet experience, has had a significant effect on industrial production in Northeast China. At present, the workers and staff in the major departments of Guannei have been largely organized. Therefore, rationalization proposals are no longer just feasible in Northeast China, but are an important task that should be promoted throughout the country.

　　丰台机务段开展合理化建议
    生产效率骤增节省大量成本
    工人日报著论要求各地倡行
    【新华社二十三日讯】据今日此间工人日报载，天津铁路管理局丰台机务段自开展合理化建议运动以来，三个月中出现了有关提高生产效率、延长机车寿命、安全卫生等合理化建议大小二十件，经行政机构采纳实行后，已使生产工作大大改进。机械组工长李圣言创造了机车汽缸和汽室的削正器各一种，使修理汽缸汽室泄漏的工作效率大大提高。过去汽缸、汽室需要修理时必须送入铁路工厂，需时两月左右，以每台机车挂车皮四十多节、平均日行三百五十五公里计算，两个月内损失极大。李圣言创造了新工具后，机务段自己即可修理，而且只需四天时间。翻砂间工长高振声创造了用化铁炉与化铜炉配合炼铜，使炼铜量由过去的每日六百公斤增到一千五百公斤，满足并且超过了机务段的需要量，而且每炉成本较过去节省了五百五十万元。在提高效率方面，以孟献武新发明的自动切管机而论，其效率较使用人力提高了二十倍。丰台机务段行政、共产党支部、工会和青年团等领导方面对于合理化建议运动的重视是使运动开展的重要原因之一。该段段长与工会常委会共同组织了合理化建议委员会，由段长任主任委员，工会生产委员专管合理化建议的搜集。段长负责帮助工人克服提出合理化建议时所遇到的困难。共产党支部和青年团亦发动党员团员积极参加这一运动。在提出了合理化建议的工人中，党员团员约占半数。
    工人日报今日就提倡合理化建议一事发表社论指出，合理化建议对关内一般工厂企业来说还是一个新问题，而且缺乏经验：但就丰台机务段初步开展合理化建议运动的效果来说，已证明在工人阶级为领导的新民主主义政权下，工人群众的积极性和创造性是一个伟大无穷的潜在力量，问题只在于行政管理人员和工会工作者如何去发掘与运用。社论号召行政与工会人员倾听群众意见，深入工人群众，领导他们研究生产问题，从实际出发，鼓励他们提出改进与提高生产的各种建议；并对这些建议，不论大小，均应采取欢迎的、严肃的、负责的态度，加以研究，正确的执行，不正确或一时难以办到的应予以解释，而不能搁在一边不理。凡被采纳并行之有效的合理建议，除予以名誉表扬与奖励外，应按其建议的实际价值，予以应得的物质奖励。社论指出：在苏联先进经验直接影响与帮助之下的东北工业部门的合理化建议运动，已对东北工业生产发生了重大的作用；目前关内各主要部门的工人职员业已大部组织起来，因此，合理化建议已经不只是东北可行而是全国都应该倡行的重要工作了。
