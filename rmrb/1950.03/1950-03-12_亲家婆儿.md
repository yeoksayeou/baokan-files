　　Little Guo was about to give birth, and her mother-in-law happened to fall ill. Little Guo's husband, Shuangquan, worked in the district and hadn't been able to come home to see her for several days. Little Guo's mother-in-law asked the father of Little Shun, who lived in the front yard, to take a cart to fetch her own mother to take care of her during the postpartum period.

　　Little Guo's maternal home was near the city walls, which could be considered a newly liberated area, unlike Little Guo's husband's home, which was a base area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Little Guo's mother, a widow, was hard of hearing and didn't pay much attention to outside affairs. Although the city had been liberated for two years, she hadn't seen much of the new world. This was her first time staying at her daughter's home.

　　Little Guo was having her first child, and it was a difficult labor. She felt a twisting pain in her stomach and her head was swelling. Her mother stewed two eggs for her to drink. Her mother sat on the kang with Little Shun's mother, watching Little Guo's difficult labor. Little Guo's mother was a little impatient, and Little Shun's mother comforted her, saying, "First births are all like this, don't be afraid."

　　Little Guo's mother stayed by her daughter's side until dawn when Little Guo finally gave birth to the child. Little Shun's mother helped Little Guo's mother clean up the mess on the kang, saying, "This was still quick; when I gave birth to Little Shun for the first time, that was really difficult! It took a whole day." Little Guo's mother didn't answer, always pouting as if someone owed her two hundred coins. Little Shun's mother knew she was hard of hearing, so she said loudly, "Little Guo's mother-in-law has been looking forward to the baby for a long time! This is great." Little Shun's mother cleaned up, then looked at the child, and said with a smile, "The baby is really handsome, with bright eyes." Little Guo's mother sat by the stove, making egg drop soup for Little Guo, muttering to herself. Little Shun's mother listened for a while, then said, "Little Guo's mother-in-law has a really good temper, she treats Little Guo like her own daughter. She told others, 'After the new year, we'll have food, clothes, and a place to live, my child will marry a wife, and I'll become a mother-in-law! I won't act like a traditional mother-in-law, the world has changed, young people are progressing fast, my old brain is slow to turn...'." Little Shun's mother looked at Little Guo's mother: "Today's daughters-in-law are really different from when we were daughters-in-law, they are really lucky."

　　After Little Guo's mother fed the eggs to Little Guo, Little Guo said to her mother, "I feel a little flustered." Little Shun's mother added, "Drinking the eggs will calm you down." Seeing that everything was fine, she said, "I'm going back to rest, you rest too, you haven't slept all night!"

　　By this time, it was already broad daylight. Little Guo closed her eyes and snored lightly. The child moved around in the quilt, breathing heavily, occasionally squeaking a few times. After a while, it seemed to fall asleep too. Only Little Guo's mother couldn't sleep, her stomach churning with anger, tossing and turning, constantly thinking wildly, constantly complaining: "How can this be! The daughter-in-law is in confinement, and not even a relative comes to visit, doesn't even ask if she needs anything!"

　　★　★　★

　　Two days later, Shuangquan returned from the district. Shuangquan's mother sat up from the kang, her hair disheveled, her face yellow and waxy. "Mother! Is your illness better?" Shuangquan asked, looking at his mother. "My illness is almost better, I can eat now!" Shuangquan was very happy to hear this and said, "After you get better, you need to rest more!" Shuangquan's mother, seeing her son's happy appearance, suddenly said, "Your wife gave birth the night before last, go and see her, I've been sick these past few days and couldn't take care of her. Anyway, everything was prepared long ago, and her mother is there. I was just about to send you a message, it's good you came, go and see her!"

　　Little Guo's mother was in the room cooking rice porridge for Little Guo. Hearing someone pushing the door open, she frowned and asked, "Who is it?" Shuangquan said outside, "It's me." Little Guo's mother quickly walked over, moved the chair propping up the door, and opened the door. Seeing it was her son-in-law, she seemed to be stopping him, saying, "She's only a few days into confinement, it's not good to see strangers!" Shuangquan smiled without caring, saying, "There's no such superstitious nonsense." After a while, Little Guo's mother asked her son-in-law, "Hmph! She gave birth to a little girl with the first child." Shuangquan said, "In this day and age, aren't boys and girls the same!" Then, Shuangquan asked about the situation these past few days. Little Guo's mother was full of resentment and started scolding him when she saw her son-in-law: "Hmph! I've never seen such a daughter-in-law in confinement, lying in bed and not even a soul to be seen. You're not at home, so that's one thing, but aren't there other people besides you?" Shuangquan explained, "It just happened that my mother is also sick! Otherwise, I would have come earlier." "What a coincidence!" Little Guo's mother didn't believe a word of it: "Alas! I'm just an old woman, running around doing everything, and besides, things aren't complete, and besides..." "Alright! Alright!" Little Guo shouted loudly at her mother's deaf ears from inside the quilt: "Mother! Go and pull back the oilcloth in the yard!" Little Guo's mother answered "Okay" and left.

　　Shuangquan asked his wife, "Why is your mother always in that mood?" Little Guo said, "Mother is hard of hearing, she's never been to a meeting her whole life, she always believes in the old ways, alas! There's no way!" Shuangquan asked again, "Are you short of anything at home?" Little Guo said, "We're not short of anything, your mother prepared all the food and supplies a month ago, don't listen to my mother's nonsense, that rigid mind, she only feels that the mother-in-law is not as good as her own mother. Let me ask you, is your mother's illness getting better?" "Much better?" Shuangquan said, then walked to the side of the kang, lifted a corner of the quilt and gently poked the baby's face, saying, "It's not small," then wrapped them up in the quilt, and sat back down on the chair.

　　Little Guo's mother pulled the oilcloth back and put it on the kang, muttering to herself: "How can one person take care of everything, confinement is not like ordinary times,... never seen anything like this..." Little Guo, hearing this from inside the quilt, didn't know whether to be angry or laugh: "Mother! Are you crazy? If you don't want to stay here, go back to our house, don't just keep muttering like that, it sounds bad to others! You don't come here often, you don't know how people are, don't always look at people with old eyes..." Shuangquan added, "If my mother wasn't sick, she would have come long ago! She must be very anxious." Shuangquan, seeing his mother-in-law crying with a sad face, said, "My mother is not the kind of person who doesn't do things properly, you have to think positively, you can't..." Shuangquan hadn't finished speaking when Little Guo's mother interrupted, "Alright! Alright! So it's my fault, is that alright?" As she spoke, she began to cry sadly, wiping her tears with her sleeve, saying, "You young people don't understand anything, it's always been like this for generations." Shuangquan persuaded her in every way until she stopped talking.

　　★　　★　　★

　　Two more days passed, and Little Guo's milk hadn't come in yet, and what little there was wasn't enough for the baby to eat, so Shuangquan's mother brought her daughter, Yinfeng, over.

　　Yinfeng had always been good to Little Guo. Hearing that Little Guo's child had no milk to eat, she said to her mother, "Your little grandson can already eat solid food, let him eat that, and let my sister-in-law's child eat my milk, and I'll leave when my sister-in-law's milk comes in." Shuangquan's mother was very happy to hear her daughter's words: "That's why I called you here, if we found someone to coax the child, the child wouldn't be comfortable, and it would cost money, this way we can save a lot of trouble." But Little Guo's mother didn't like the sound of Yinfeng coming. She said to Little Guo, "You're letting your sister-in-law come to coax your child? They can't even bear to find someone, this family is really stingy!" Little Guo was instantly delighted when she heard that Yinfeng was coming to coax the child: "It's so much better that my sister is coming, it's more reassuring to have our own people, Mother! My sister and I are very close!" "Hmph!" Little Guo's mother snorted and glared at her, saying, "Silly child, you think everyone is a good person, how many good sister-in-laws are there? Isn't she just being sent by your mother-in-law, isn't this so they don't have to spend money?" Little Guo was extremely anxious when she heard this: "Mother! How can you say such things? You..."

　　Before she could finish speaking, someone pushed the door open. Little Guo saw it was Yinfeng and called out, "Sister is here!" "I'm here! How are you?" Yinfeng said as she climbed onto the kang, looking at the child: "Come on! Let her eat first!" Yinfeng held the child in her arms, and Little Guo looked at Yinfeng and asked, "Sister, where is my little nephew?" "Playing with his grandmother!" Yinfeng said! "He's big enough, just give him a steamed bun to eat!" Yinfeng chatted with Little Guo while coaxing the child, talking about childbirth, and about going to winter school! Little Guo said, "Having a child means I can't focus on production." "You call this participating in production?" Yinfeng said, sticking out her tongue playfully, and handed the sleeping child to Little Guo, saying, "You'll get tired talking for so long, hold the child and rest!" Little Guo's mother, sitting beside them, had been angry, but watching the close bond between the two sisters, she felt a sweetness in her heart. Just as she was about to interject, Yinfeng turned her head and said intimately, "Auntie! You must be tired these past few days, my mother said that you've been taking care of everything by yourself. It's just bad timing, my mother is also sick, so you'll have to work a few more days." "It's nothing! It's nothing!" Little Guo's mother suddenly didn't know what to say: "It's not hard, it's my own daughter, it should be like this, I'm just worried that the child has nothing to eat!" Yinfeng said, "I told my mother a long time ago, I'll leave when my sister-in-law's milk comes in." Little Guo's mother said, "Will your mother-in-law allow it?" Yinfeng said with a smile, "Why wouldn't she? Things are different now than before! Things are better now, the mother-in-law treats the daughter-in-law as her own daughter, and the daughter-in-law treats the mother-in-law as her own mother." Little Guo's mother listened, her eyes smiling into two crescents.

　　After Yinfeng had been there for a while, she went to her mother's room. Little Guo's mother said to Little Guo, "That Yinfeng is really sensible." Little Guo pretended to be spoiled and said, "Hmph, you only know that now, you were scolding her just now, when my mother-in-law gets better and comes to see me, you should open your mind." Little Guo's mother was speechless, sitting there blankly, like a piece of wood.

　　After a day, Little Guo's mother-in-law recovered from her illness and came to see her daughter-in-law. As soon as she entered the door, she said to Little Guo's mother, "Mother-in-law, I'm so sorry that you had to endure these days for me, I really feel bad about it." Little Guo's mother also said, "It's the same no matter who takes care of her." "Mother! Are you better?" Little Guo asked, getting up from the quilt. Little Guo's mother-in-law walked over, looked at her granddaughter, and carefully wrapped her up. Little Guo said, "Mother! Your complexion hasn't recovered yet, you should rest more!" Little Guo's mother-in-law said, "As long as your health is strong, I'm happy, I'm just afraid that you won't be strong after giving birth." Turning to Little Guo's mother, she said, "We're both getting old, we can't do anything, as long as we see these young people doing well, we're happy in our hearts, mother-in-law, don't you think so?"

　　No one knows what was going on, Little Guo's mother didn't say a word: she just felt that her mother-in-law was too intimate!

　　亲家婆儿
    翟树雷
    小果就要生孩子，她的婆婆偏偏闹起病来。小果的男人双全在区上工作，好些天也顾不得家来看看。小果婆婆便托前院住的小顺的爹，套车去接了亲家婆儿来服侍月子。
    小果娘家是城根子附近，也算是个新解放的地区。不像小果婆家是抗日战争时的根据地。小果的娘，一个寡妇老婆子，耳朵又聋不济的，很少打听外面的事，虽说城里解放了二年咧，新的世道，她可还没有见识多少。这回到闺女家来住，还是第一次。
    小果是头生，挺难产的，肚里一股劲拧着痛，头也有点发涨。她娘给她炖了两个鸡蛋让她喝了。她娘跟着小顺的妈坐在炕头上，看着小果那副难产的样儿，她娘有点沉不住气，小顺的妈便安慰她说：“头生孩子，都是这样，甭害怕。”
    这会小果的娘守着闺女，一直到冷清明儿，小果才算把孩子生下来。小顺的妈帮着小果的娘，一边收拾炕上的脏东西，一边说：“这还算利索呢：我头一回生小顺时，那才难呢！整整闹了一天。”小果的娘没有答腔，老是噘着个嘴像谁短她二百钱似的。小顺妈知道她耳力不强，就大声说：“小果婆婆早就盼望着娃娃呢！这下子可好了。”小顺的妈收拾清了以后，便端详着那小孩子，笑嘻嘻地说：“模样长的真俊，明眉大眼的。”小果的娘，坐在炉台边，给小果合泡鸡蛋，嘴里嘟嘟嚷嚷的，小顺的妈听着听着，便开了口：“小果婆婆那脾气可真好，成天把小果当闺女看待，人家给别人说：翻身后，有吃有穿有住，俺孩儿又娶上媳妇，俺也当上婆婆啦！俺可不拿婆婆的架儿，世道变了，年轻人进步快，俺这老脑子转的挺慢……。”小顺的妈看了看小果的娘：“现在的媳妇跟咱们当媳妇那阵可真不同了，人家他们这伙年青人才算有福气呢。”
    小果的娘，把鸡蛋喂着小果吃后，小果向她娘说：“心里稍发点慌。”小顺的妈接着说：“喝了鸡蛋定定神就好了。”他看着没有事了便说：“我回去歇歇，你也歇歇吧，一宵没合眼啦！”
    这时天已经大亮了。小果合着眼轻轻的打着鼾，小孩在盖着的被窝里直动弹，呼吃呼吃的，断不了伊呀伊呀的吱喽几下子，呆了会儿，似乎也睡着了，唯独小果的娘说啥也睡不着，肚子气的古乘乘的反来复去的，一个劲胡思乱想，一个劲的埋怨：“那有这样的！媳妇坐了月子，连个亲近人踏踏门槛都没有，也不问问缺啥短啥！”★  ★  ★
    过了两天，双全从区上回来，双全的娘从炕上坐起来，披散着头发，脸上黄腊腊的，“娘！你的病轻点了吧！”双全看着娘问。“病快好了，这几天能吃饭啦！”双全听了很喜欢，随着又说：“病好了，以后可要多歇着点哩！”双全的娘看着儿子喜欢的样子，忽然说：“你媳妇前天晚上养了，你快去看看吧，这几天我闹着病也顾不上她，反正东西早就预备下了，她娘也在那儿，我正说给你捎个信，你来的正好，你快去看看吧！”
    小果的娘正在屋里给小果熬米饭，听着有人推门，便皱着眉头问了声：“是谁？”双全在外面说：“是我。”小果的娘赶紧走过去，把顶着门的椅子挪开，把门开开，见是女婿，像是阻拦的样子说：“才几天的月子，见生人可不好！”双全毫不在意的笑着说：“那有那些迷信的俗讲究呢？”呆了会儿，小果的娘问女婿说：“哼！头生就添了个小妮子。”双全说：“这年头男女还不是一样！”接着：双全便问起这几天情况来，小果的娘正装着一肚子闷气，见了女婿就数落起来：“哼！俺就没有见过这样的媳妇坐月子，人都躺在炕上了连个人毛也没见，你不在家，那甭说了，除了你没别人啦？”双全便解释：“真是赶了个巧，俺娘也病着哩！要不早来了。”“真巧！”小果的娘根本就不信这一套：“唉！光剩我这么一个老婆子里里外外的都得跑，再一说，东西也不全，再一说……”“得啦！得啦！”小果在被窝里冲着娘的聋耳朵使劲喊了一嗓子：“娘！你去把院里那块油布拉回来吧！”小果的娘答了一个“是”便去了。
    双全问他媳妇：“你娘怎老是那脾气？”小果说：“娘聋着个耳朵，成年到辈子不开个会，总是认那套老理呗，唉！真没法！”双全又问：“家里短啥不短？”小果说：“啥也不短，头一个月咱娘就把吃的用的预备好了，甭听俺娘瞎嘟念，那死脑筋，光觉着婆婆不如自个儿的亲娘。我问问你咱娘的病轻点没有？”“轻多了？”双全说着：便走到炕边，掀开一点被窝轻轻捅了捅小孩的脸蛋说：“个可不小，”说着把被窝给她们裹好，又坐到椅子上。
    小果的娘，把油布拉回来，放在炕上，嘴里嘟嘟念念的：“一个人那能顾得开，坐月子不比平素，……没见过这样的……”小果在被窝里听着气也不是，笑也不是：“娘！你疯了不是？你不愿意在这呆着，就上咱家去，光这么嘟念，让人家听了多不好！又不常上这来，你知道人家怎么样，你别光用老眼光看人……”双全也接着说：“俺娘要不是有病，早来啦！她心里还不知道怎样着急呢！”双全看着丈母娘哭丧着脸，便又说：“俺娘不是那种办事不利亮的人，你老人家也得向好处想，你不能……”双全还没有说完，小果的娘便接上了腔：“得啦！得啦！就是我不好还不行？”说着说着便伤心的哭起来，她用衣襟一边儿擦泪，一边儿说：“你们年轻人懂啥，多少辈子都是这样儿。”双全说好说歹的劝她，一直到把她说的不言声才走了。
    ★      ★     ★
    又过了两天，小果的奶水还没有下来，有个三口两口的也不够吃，双全的娘便把闺女银凤接了来。
    银凤平常和小果就挺好，听说小果的孩子没奶吃，便和娘说：“你那小外甥已经能吃东西了，叫他吃东西，奶叫嫂嫂的小孩吃，啥时嫂嫂的奶水下来了，我啥时走。”双全的娘听了闺女的话，特别高兴：“叫了你来就是为这，若是找个人哄，孩子又不舒贴，又得花钱，这样可就省了大事了。”可是小果的娘听说银凤来了，却觉得不是味儿，她向小果说：“让你那小姑子来给你哄孩子来啦？连个人也舍不得找，这家子人家可真是扣索呀！”小果一听银凤来哄孩子，心眼里立时痛快的了不得：“妹妹来了那可好多了，自己人多踏实，娘！我跟妹妹可好着哩！”“哼！”小果的娘鼻子眼出着气白楞着眼说：“傻孩子，你拿谁都当好人，小姑子可有几个好东西？还不是你婆婆叫来的，这不是不用花钱吗？”小果一听这句话急得什么似的：“娘！你怎么说出这样的话？你……”
    她的话还没有出口，就有人推门进来，小果一看是银凤，便喊着“妹妹来了！”“来啦！你好吧！”银凤说着便爬在炕上，看着小孩：“来吧！先让她吃吃吧！”银凤把小孩抱在怀里，小果看着银凤问道：“妹妹：小外甥在那儿哩？”“跟着他姥姥玩哩！”银凤说！“他大了，拿个馍馍喂着吃就行啦！”银凤一边哄着小孩，一边和小果聊着，聊生产，聊上冬校的事！小果说：“弄了个孩子连生产也不能好好搞啦。”“你这也算搞生产啊！”银凤挑皮的笑着吐了吐舌头，把睡的甜眯眯的孩子递给小果说：“说话工夫大了你累，你搂着孩子歇歇吧！”小果的娘，在旁边坐着，本来是气呼呼的，眼看着人家姐妹俩那种亲密的劲儿，心里也甜丝丝的，才要插口，银凤却转过头来，亲近的说：“大娘！你这几天可累了，听俺娘说，就光你一个人照应。事情赶的真巧，俺娘也病了，你还得多费几天心呢？”“没啥！没啥！”小果的娘一下子倒不知说什么好了：“这受啥累，自己闺女，该这样的，就是愁孩子没的吃！”银凤说：“我早给俺娘说过，啥时嫂嫂奶下来了，俺啥时候走。”小果的娘说：“那你婆婆行喽？”银凤笑着说：“怎么不行？现在跟从前可不一样啦！现在好了，婆婆把儿媳妇看做亲闺女，媳妇也把婆婆当亲娘看待。”小果的娘听着，喜欢的两只眼笑成了两个月牙。
    银凤拉了一阵，便到娘屋去了，小果的娘向小果说：“人家银凤真懂事。”小果故意装着娇里娇气的样儿：“哼，才知道，刚才你还骂人家，等到俺婆婆好了，来看我，你也就该开脑筋了。”说的小果的娘闭口无言，呆呆的坐在那儿，像一块木头似的。
    呆了一天，小果婆婆的病好了，来看媳妇，一进门，便向小果娘说：“亲家婆儿，你替我受了这些天的累，我心里真过意不去。”小果的娘也说：“谁照应也是一样。”“娘！你好了？”小果在被窝里爬起来问。小果的婆婆走到跟前，看了看孙女，又小心的裹好。小果说：“娘！你的脸色还没有复原，还是多歇几天吧！”小果的婆婆说：“只要你们身子骨儿都结结实实的就好，俺就是怕你生了孩子身子不结实。”回头向小果的娘说：“咱们都上了年纪，啥也不行了，只要看着他们年轻人好好的，心里就高兴，亲家婆儿，你说是不是？”
    也不知道是怎么回事，小果的娘，连一句话也没有说：她只觉得她的亲家婆儿太亲近了！
