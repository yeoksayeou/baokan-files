Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: According to returned Overseas Chinese from South Korea, the South Korean Li Seung-man puppet government is viciously persecuting Overseas Chinese in South Korea. As early as last autumn, the Li Seung-man government, using the pretext of smuggling by Chinese merchants, sealed up Chinese merchants' warehouses, and goods successively imported by Chinese merchants were also detained by South Korean customs. In mid-December of last year, Li Seung-man personally issued a statement to exclude Overseas Chinese. Subsequently, the puppet Ministry of Trade revoked the insurance permits, warehouse permits, and trade permits of Chinese merchants. At the end of last year, the Li Seung-man government, again using the excuse of "implementing land reform," announced that Overseas Chinese had no right to own or lease land, and all land owned or leased by Overseas Chinese in South Korea would be confiscated. Real estate bought by Overseas Chinese from the Japanese during the Japanese occupation era was also entirely confiscated by the Li Seung-man government. On January 22nd of this year, the Li Seung-man government summoned Chinese merchants traveling between Hong Kong and Incheon, South Korea, to a meeting. More than 40 Chinese merchants who attended were all arrested. Many of those arrested were severely tortured. One arrested person from Tongshun Store in Incheon was blinded in one eye by special agents using electric shocks. In this plunder by the Li Seung-man government, many Chinese merchants suffered great losses, and some had to close down. A number of Kuomintang secret agents remaining in South Korea colluded with the Li Seung-man government to persecute ordinary Overseas Chinese. Some Kuomintang secret agents have been hired by the Li Seung-man government to specifically persecute Overseas Chinese.

　　李承晚傀儡迫害华侨
    【新华社北京五日电】据由南朝鲜归国华侨谈：南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府凶恶地迫害南朝鲜华侨。早在去年秋天，李承晚政府即以华商走私为借口，查封了华商仓库，华商陆续进口的货物亦为南朝鲜海关扣押。去年十二月中旬李承晚更亲自发表谈话排斥华侨，接着伪贸易部即撤销了华商的保险许可、仓库许可及贸易许可。去年年底，李承晚政府又借口“实行土地改革”，宣布华侨无分地或承租土地之权，华侨在南朝鲜所有土地或承租土地均将没收。华侨在日本统治时代由日人手中买得之房产亦全遭李承晚政府没收。今年一月二十二日李承晚政府召集往返香港和南朝鲜仁川间的华商开会，到会华商四十余人全遭逮捕，被捕者很多人被严刑拷打，仁川同顺店一被捕者为特务人员施用电刑瞎掉一只眼睛。在李承晚政府这次掠夺中，许多华商受极大损失，有的则只好停业。留在南朝鲜的一部分国民党特务分子则与李承晚政府勾结在一起，对一般华侨实行迫害。有些国民党特务分子已为李承晚政府所雇用，专门迫害华侨。
