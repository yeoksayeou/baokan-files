Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th. The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its sixth administrative meeting on the 7th, as an expanded meeting. Attending were 45 individuals, including committee members and heads of subordinate committees, departments, bureaus, offices, banks, academies, and divisions, with 880 cadres from various agencies attending as observers. Chairman Peng Dehuai presided over the meeting. The meeting began with a briefing by Committee Member Jia Tuofu, who had returned from the National Finance Conference in Beijing, regarding the "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work." He pointed out: As long as we resolutely implement the Central Committee's decision on unified financial work, any difficulties facing us will definitely be gradually resolved. We must always remember the telegram that Chairman Mao sent to the cadres and people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region last year, maintain a spirit of hard struggle, and all difficulties will be readily solved. However, in our implementation of the decision on unified national financial and economic work, we will encounter various obstacles. This requires us to mobilize the masses, combine leadership with the masses, and give serious criticism to departments and individuals who do not implement the decision; in severe cases, disciplinary sanctions will be imposed in order to achieve the decision of unified national financial and economic work. Committee Member Yang Mingxuan then spoke. In his speech, he criticized the extravagant and wasteful behavior of a few staff members. Committee Member Bai Rubing, in his speech, listed disorganized and undisciplined phenomena in certain areas, such as disregarding state tax revenue, arbitrarily increasing or decreasing public grain, misappropriating tax funds, and using public grain. He especially criticized the Weinan sub-district for arbitrarily deciding to use state funds without the approval of higher-level governments, as well as certain agencies for purchasing cars without authorization.

Finally, Chairman Peng Dehuai spoke on the significance of the Government Administration Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work, and the ways to overcome obstacles in implementing the decision. He said: We should unconditionally, resolutely, and thoroughly implement the Government Administration Council's decision. Today, we are in a new period of unprecedented national unity, and our financial and economic work must immediately shift from decentralized operations to unified management in order to complete the historical task of building a prosperous and strong new China. Chairman Peng emphasized: Some comrades believe that extravagance and waste are economic issues rather than political issues, which is incorrect. Is it not a serious political issue when staff members in a national regime waste state financial resources, increase the fiscal deficit, and affect the people's lives? If our revolutionary comrades are infected with this shameful and hateful ideology and habits, and harm the interests of the people, it is a criminal act. Therefore, we must be vigilant, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, practice frugality, and maintain a simple style of working hard together with the laboring people. Only in this way can we guide the people towards a happy and healthy new society. If a Communist Party member engages in extravagance, waste, and corruption, then he has lost the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member. He is not qualified to bear the glorious title of the vanguard of the proletariat, and should also be subject to government legal sanctions and party disciplinary action. Chairman Peng also criticized the phenomenon of extravagance and waste that began to grow after the establishment of the Northwest situation in August last year, and sharply criticized the serious mistake of individual staff members succumbing to the temptation of the corrupt life of the bourgeoisie in the cities, pursuing enjoyment, and unconsciously surrendering to the corrupt lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. He pointed out: In order to ensure the implementation of the Central Government's decision, we must wage an irreconcilable struggle against extravagance, waste, corruption, departmentalism, and bureaucracy. All departments should establish inspection systems and conduct in-depth inspections of their work. Every Communist Party member and non-Party friend participating in the work of state organs should examine themselves and have the responsibility to examine others, and eliminate various obstacles in our implementation of the decision on unified financial and economic work.

　　西北军政委员会举行扩大会议
    坚决执行财经统一决定
    彭德怀主席强调严禁铺张浪费
    【新华社西安十日电】西北军政委员会第六次行政会议于七日举行扩大会议。出席的有各委员及所属各委员会、部、局、署、行、院、厅负责人四十五名，列席各机关干部八百八十名。会议由彭德怀主席主持，会议首先听取自北京参加全国财政会议归来的贾拓夫委员关于“统一国家财政经济工作的决定”的传达。他指出：只要我们坚决执行中央关于统一财政工作决定，存在我们面前的任何困难都一定能够逐渐得到解决。我们要永远记住去年毛主席给陕甘宁边区干部和延安人民的电文，保持艰苦奋斗作风，一切困难将会迎刃而解。但是，在我们执行统一国家财经工作的决定中，将会遇到各种阻力。这就要求我们发动群众，使领导与群众结合起来，对不执行决定的部门与个人，轻则给以严正批评，重则予以纪律制裁，以求实现统一国家财政经济工作的决定。继由杨明轩委员发言。他在发言中批评少数工作人员铺张浪费的行为。白如冰委员在发言中列举某些地区不重视国家税收、随意增减公粮、挪用税款、动用公粮等的无组织无纪律现象，并特别批评渭南分区不经上级政府批准、随意决定动用国家钱财，与某些机关不经批准擅自购买汽车等行为。
    最后由彭德怀主席就政务院统一国家财政经济工作决定的意义，克服执行决定中阻力的途径等问题发言。他说：我们应当无条件地，坚决地，彻底地执行政务院的决定。今天我们处在国家空前统一的新时期，我们的财经工作必须立即由分散经营转向统一管理，才能完成建设繁荣富强的新中国的历史任务。彭主席强调指出：有的同志认为铺张浪费是经济问题而不是政治问题，这是不对的。难道一个国家政权中的工作人员，浪费国家财力，增加财政赤字，影响人民生活，还不是严重的政治问题吗？我们的革命同志，如果沾染上这种可耻可憎的思想习惯；危害人民利益，便是一种罪恶的行为。因之我们必须警惕，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，节衣缩食，保持和劳动人民共艰苦的朴素作风。只有这样，我们才能引导人民走向康乐的新社会。如果共产党员有了铺张浪费和贪污腐化的行为，那就失去了作为共产党员的起码条件，他没有资格承当无产阶级先锋队的光荣称号，同时还应受政府法律的制裁和党内纪律的处分。彭主席又批判了去年八月西北大局奠定以后开始潜滋暗长的铺张浪费的现象，尖锐地批评了个别工作人员在城市中经不起资产阶级腐化生活的引诱，追求享受，在不知不觉中向资产阶级腐化生活方式投降的严重错误。他指出：为了保证实施中央政府的决定，我们要向铺张浪费、贪污腐化、本位主义、官僚主义作不调和的斗争。各部门应建立检查制度，深入检查工作。凡是参加国家机关工作的每个共产党员和党外朋友应都检查自己，并有责任检查别人，清除我们执行统一财经工作决定中的各种阻力。
