　　【News from this newspaper】The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council convened its first executive committee meeting on the 22nd. During the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Beijing First Workers' Congress, which took production as the central task, a three-month work plan for the trade union was discussed and formulated, and standing committee members were elected.

　　In the three-month work plan for the trade union, the first task for public enterprises is to mobilize workers to deeply discuss production plans, and based on these plans, organize and mobilize employees to strive to reduce costs and improve quality. This will serve as the practical content for carrying out democratic management in factories and the fighting goal for launching production competitions. It was generally believed that the conditions for establishing and improving factory management committees in major public factories in Beijing are in place. This work should be started first to mobilize workers to better discuss production plans, sign collective contracts, and launch production competitions. In the process of establishing management committees, formalism should be prevented, and after establishment, existing major problems in the factory that are necessary and possible to solve should be discussed and resolved. However, problems should be grasped at the core, studied, and solved one by one. Avoid discussing a large number of issues at once, resulting in none being well-resolved or effectively implemented. Regardless of whether the management committee is established or improved, the factory employee representative meeting must first be held effectively. When solving problems and educating the masses, the work objectives must be very clear, and the steps and methods must be based on the actual situation of each factory. Regarding the signing of collective contracts, if it is currently not possible to sign a factory-wide collective contract, it can start from partial, preliminary aspects, or a single production task. Relevant current production tasks and necessary and possible welfare issues should be clearly stipulated in the contract. In factories where production competitions can be launched, employees must be mobilized to first strive for new records in reducing costs and improving quality. At the same time, workers' inventions, innovations, and rationalization proposals should be encouraged, promoting the care of machines and conservation of raw materials, and continuously creating new records. To this end, appropriate reward and punishment measures and systems must be formulated simultaneously. The main tasks for private factories, handicraft workshops, porters, shop assistants, and workers in cultural and educational unions are to consolidate organizations and conduct education in a planned manner, and continue to sign labor-capital collective contracts or temporary agreements to implement the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. In private factories, there are plans to select factories with relatively normal production, where workers have been selected to participate in factory management, and where collective contracts stipulate bonus incentives for exceeding quotas, to study and launch production competitions to gain experience. In addition, the municipal trade union council itself is preparing to adjust its leadership structure in a planned manner, strengthen departmental work, change its work style, focus on key tasks, gain experience, and promote the overall situation to ensure the completion of the above tasks.

　　At the meeting, Comrades Peng Zhen and Liu Ren emphasized that the central problems in Beijing's production are currently cost and quality. The cost of many factory products is too high, and the quality is too poor, making it difficult to sell the produced goods. If improvements are not made, it will be difficult to have better development prospects. The main goal of trade union work in the future should be to improve production, reduce costs, and improve quality. This should be used as the main standard for checking trade union work. In this way, if the trade union thinks of ways to improve production, and the factory director takes the initiative to solve workers' welfare problems, the goals of the trade union and the administration will be aligned, and the relationship will naturally improve. Only when production is improved can workers' welfare problems be guaranteed.

　　京市总工会召开首届执委会
    制定三个月的工会工作计划
    动员职工减低成本提高质量
    会上选出常务委员二十一人
    【本报讯】北京市总工会于二十二日召开第一次执行委员会。会中，根据本市首届工人代表大会以生产为中心任务的决议精神，讨论和制订了今后三个月的工会工作计划，并选举了常务委员。
    在今后三个月的工会工作计划中，对公营的工作，首先是发动工人深入讨论生产计划，依据生产计划，组织动员职工为减低成本、提高质量而努力。并以此为开展工厂民主管理的实际内容，与开展生产竞赛的斗争目标。大家认为，北京各大公营工厂中，建立和健全工厂管理委员会的条件是具备的。目前应首先展开这一工作，以便发动工人更好的讨论出生产计划，进行签订集体合同及开展生产竞赛。在成立管理委员会的过程中，要防止形式主义的偏向，成立后要讨论解决工厂中现存的必要和可能解决的重大问题。但问题要抓住中心，一个个的研究解决，不要一讨论一大堆，结果使任何问题也不能很好的解决或切实执行。不论管委会的是否建立或健全，首先必须将工厂职工代表会议开好，在解决问题与教育群众时，工作目标要十分明确，步骤与方法要切实根据各厂实际情况。关于签订集体合同，如当前还不可能订全厂性的集体合同时，可由部分的、初步的，或一件生产任务开始。有关当前的生产任务与必要而可能解决的福利问题均应在合同中明确规定。在已具备开展生产竞赛运动的工厂，必须动员职工首先为力求减低成本，提高质量的新纪录而开展竞赛。同时要鼓励起职工的创造发明与合理化建议，进行爱护机器和节约原料，并为此不断造成新的纪录。为此，必须同时制定适当的奖惩办法与制度。在私营工厂、手工业作坊、搬运、店员、文教等工会中的工作，主要是有计划的巩固组织与进行教育，并继续签订劳资集体合同或临时协议，以贯彻发展生产、劳资两利政策。在私营工厂中，并计划选择生产情况较正常及工人已选派代表参加工厂管理并有集体合同且规定了超额奖励的工厂，研究开展生产竞赛，以取得经验。另外在市总工会本身，并准备有计划地调整领导机构，加强部务工作，改变工作作风，有重点地进行工作，取得经验，推动全体，以保证上述任务的完成。
    在会议中彭真、刘仁同志着重指出：北京市在生产中的中心问题目前是成本和质量问题。很多工厂的产品，成本太高，质量太坏，生产的东西不好销售；如不力求改进，就难有更好的发展前途。今后工会工作的主要目标就是要搞好生产，减低成本，提高质量。并以此作为检查工会工作的主要标准。如此，工会多在生产上想办法，厂长多主动解决工人福利问题，工会和行政的目标一致，关系自然就可以搞好。只有生产搞好了，工人的福利问题才可以得到保证。
