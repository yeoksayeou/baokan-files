Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th—The Central People's Government Ministry of Education issued instructions on March 12 regarding persisting in education work in disaster areas. The full text is as follows:

This spring, education in many regions across the country is being severely affected by famine. The people in the disaster areas are prioritizing saving lives, and the situation is extremely tense and difficult. If educators do not have a full understanding of the disaster situation and the government's disaster relief policies, and if they do not make the greatest determination to adopt a set of methods suitable for the specific circumstances to persist in working in the disaster areas, it will result in education being divorced from reality, a large number of schools collapsing, students dropping out of school, and teachers scattering. This will create extreme difficulties for future restoration and development of education. To this end, we offer the following points, hoping that all localities will earnestly implement them:

  Persist in School Education and First Serve Production and Disaster Relief

    1. The central task of the people in disaster areas is production for self-relief. Education work in disaster areas should first serve production and disaster relief. Educational authorities at all levels in disaster areas must fully recognize this and promptly shift their focus and the content and methods of their work. Educators should first make themselves qualified propagandists and organizers to mobilize the masses to implement production and disaster relief, and persist in school education, adopting educational content and methods suitable for the disaster situation, mobilizing and organizing students to produce, and reducing the burden on student families. In severely affected areas, if schools really cannot be maintained, educators should immediately switch to conducting propaganda among the masses and organizing production, leading the masses to fight against famine arduously and bravely. All apathy, panic, pessimism, disappointment, or evasive attitudes and actions are wrong and should be prevented and overcome.

  Adapt to Disaster Area Conditions, Combining Learning with Production

    2. According to the experience of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, in general disaster areas, as long as we can combine learning and production well, that is, both organize students to learn and organize students to produce, solving some of the students' living difficulties; learning time can be flexibly stipulated (such as taking half-day classes, morning, afternoon, and evening schools, two-headed schooling system, two-part system, etc.), so that learning does not hinder family production; educational subjects are streamlined to two or three main subjects (such as Chinese and arithmetic); in this way, schools can generally gain the support of the masses and can be maintained. Some have even increased the number of students because the school effectively organized production (such as Hebei Province). This approach to persisting in education in disaster areas mainly relies on the teachers' high level of awareness and their enthusiasm for serving the people, close ties with the masses, and a working style that starts from reality. These experiences should be widely promoted in all schools in disaster areas.

  Preserve Teachers, Preserve Schools, to Facilitate Restoration

    3. Currently, there is a phenomenon of large-scale school closures and teachers being displaced in disaster areas. This is a serious problem for education in disaster areas, and leading authorities in all localities should pay close attention to it. The central issue here is how to effectively preserve teachers so that when the disaster situation eases, schools can be restored in a timely manner. The method adopted by Hebei Province of transferring teachers from severely affected areas to teach in non-disaster areas in a planned manner, or sending them to normal schools for rotational training, is good. When it is absolutely necessary to change careers, efforts should be made to ensure that teachers remain working in their villages and districts in the capacity of teachers. Local governments must treat teachers in disaster areas with great concern, handling matters in a planned and led manner, and opposing the phenomenon of leaders letting them fend for themselves without regard. Schools in disaster areas should be maintained as much as possible, and should not be closed unless absolutely necessary; if they are closed, their buildings and equipment must be preserved and not destroyed or allowed to be lost. As for merging schools, it is generally not suitable for the dispersed environment of rural areas; students who live far away will inevitably affect their ability to help with family production if they attend school, and the result of merging schools is equivalent to closing them. Therefore, this method should generally not be adopted.

  Educate Students and the People to Practice Thrift and Promote Fraternity and Mutual Assistance.

    4. The Government Administration Council instructed: The people in non-disaster areas should practice thrift and promote the spirit of fraternity and mutual assistance to help disaster areas. All educational leading authorities, down to every school, every teacher, and every student, should follow this instruction, and launch a planned movement for thrift and disaster relief, implement the spirit of fraternity and mutual assistance in education, caring for the people in disaster areas as if they were their own brothers and sisters, and strengthen students' new moral education of loving the people, loving the motherland, loving labor, and caring for public property through disaster relief work. Schools at all levels should add education about the disaster situation and the fight against famine to their regular curriculum. Schools near disaster areas should organize teachers and students to visit disaster areas and serve the disaster victims. Other schools should send letters of sympathy and condolences to the governments, farmers' associations, and schools in the disaster areas, and send books, newspapers, and relief supplies to express their deep concern for their compatriots in the disaster areas. Educational leading authorities and schools at all levels should regard this work as a political and ideological education of great significance, include it in their work agenda, and set it as an important item for checking work achievements.

  Commend Models, Popularize Experience

    5. According to preliminary understanding, although the situation in disaster areas this year is very serious and difficult, most of our educators are able to persist in their struggles, and many teachers are serving the disaster victims with hardship and dedication, being loved by the masses in disaster areas; they have made many innovations in combining production and disaster relief with education in their persistence in their educational positions. We call on all educators in disaster and non-disaster areas to learn from them, emulate them, greatly promote the spirit of not fearing difficulties and working hard, and engage in the construction of education in the new China. We instruct the educational administrative organs at all levels in disaster areas to earnestly investigate such model educators, commend and reward them, and popularize their good experiences in a timely manner in order to achieve the goal of persisting in education in disaster areas.

### 中央人民政府教育部发布指示  坚持灾区教育工作

　　中央人民政府教育部发布指示
    坚持灾区教育工作
    【新华社北京十三日电】中央人民政府教育部三月十二日发布关于坚持灾区教育工作的指示。全文如下：
    今年春季全国有不少地区的教育受着灾荒的严重影响。灾区人民是救命第一，情况十分紧张和困难。教育工作者如果对灾情和政府的救灾政策没有充分的认识，如果不下最大决心采用一套适合具体情况的办法在灾区坚持工作，那就会产生教育脱离实际、大量学校垮台、学生失学、教师星散的结果，就会造成今后恢复与发展教育的极大困难。为此，我们提示下列各点，望各地切实执行：
  坚持学校教育并首先为生产救灾服务
    一、灾区人民的中心任务是生产自救。灾区的教育工作首先应该为生产救灾服务。灾区各级教育机关对此必须充分认识，及时地转变自己的注意重点和工作的内容与方法。教育工作者首先应使自己成为动员群众实行生产救灾的称职的宣传者和组织者，并坚持学校教育，采取适合灾情的教育内容与方法，发动和组织学生生产，减轻学生家庭负担。在重灾区，学校实在不能维持时，教育工作者应立即转入向群众进行宣传和组织生产的工作，艰苦和勇敢地带领群众和灾荒作斗争。一切麻木不仁、仓皇失措、悲观失望或逃避困难的情绪和行动都是错误的，应该防止和克服。
    适应灾区情况学习结合生产
    二、根据河北、平原两省经验，在一般的灾区，只要我们能使学习和生产很好地结合，即既组织学生学习，又组织学生生产，解决学生一部分生活的困难；学习时间能灵活规定（如采取半日班，早、午、夜校，两头上学巡回制，二部制等），使学习不妨害家庭生产；教育科目精简到二、三门主课（如国语、算术）；这样，学校一般地就能得到群众的拥护，也就能维持下来。有的还因学校有效地组织了生产，学生不但不减，反有增加（如河北省）。这样坚持灾区教育的做法，主要依靠教师们的高度自觉，以及他们为人民服务的热忱，与群众密切联系和一切从实际出发的工作作风。这些经验，一切灾区的学校都应广泛推行。
    保存教师保存学校以便恢复
    三、目前灾区已经发生了学校大批停闭和教师流离失散的现象。这是灾区教育的严重问题，各地领导机关对此应十分注意。这里问题的中心是如何有效地保存教师，以便于灾情减轻时，就能及时地恢复学校。河北省实行将重灾区的教师，有计划地转移到非灾区去教书，或送师范学校轮训的办法是好的。在迫不得已，必须转业时，也应尽可能争取教师仍以教师名义留在本村本区工作。各地政府对灾区的教师必须以十分关心的态度，有计划有领导地处理，反对领导上任其自流不理不管的现象。灾区学校应尽一切可能予以维持，非到万不得已不要停闭；如若停闭，也须保存其房屋设备，不得破坏或任其散失。至于合并学校，一般不适合农村分散的环境；路远的学生入学，势必影响他们帮助家庭生产，结果并校也就等于停闭。所以一般地不应采取这项办法。
    教育学生和人民，厉行节约，发扬友爱互助。
    四、政务院指示：非灾区的人民应该厉行节约，发扬友爱互助的精神，帮助灾区非灾区的一切教育领导机关，直到每一学校，每一教师，每一学生都应遵照这一指示，有计划地展开节约救灾运动，在教育中贯彻友爱互助精神，关心灾区人民如同关心自己的兄弟姊妹一样，并通过救灾工作，加强学生爱人民、爱祖国、爱劳动、爱护公共财物的新道德教育。各级学校，应在正常的课程中，加进关于灾区情况以及和灾荒斗争的教育。临近灾区的学校，应组织教师学生参观灾区，为灾民服务。其他学校应向灾区的政府、农会、学校通信慰问，送书报送救济品等，表示对灾区同胞的亲切关怀。各级教育领导机关和学校，应将这一工作看作有巨大意义的政治思想教育，列入自己的工作日程，并定为检查工作成绩的重要项目之一。
  表扬模范  普及经验
    五、据初步了解，今年灾区情况虽然很严重很困难，但我们多数教育工作者却能坚持奋斗，其中并有不少教师艰苦卓绝，可歌可泣地为灾民服务，为灾区群众所爱戴；他们在坚持自己的教育岗位中对生产救灾与教育的结合，已有很多的创造。我们号召灾区与非灾区的一切教育工作者，向他们学习，向他们看齐，大大发扬不怕困难、艰苦奋斗的精神，从事新中国教育的建设。我们责成灾区各级教育行政机关，切实调查此类模范教育工作者，予以表扬和奖励，并及时普及他们的良好经验，以达到坚持灾区教育的目的。中央人民政府教育部
