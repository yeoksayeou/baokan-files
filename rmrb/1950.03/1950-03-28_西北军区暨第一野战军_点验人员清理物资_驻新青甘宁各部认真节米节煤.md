Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 26th - The Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have begun the work of verifying personnel and clearing materials, and continue to implement the spirit of thrift, achieving good results. Since the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to unify national financial and economic work, the corps and armies of the Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army have successively established verification committees and material clearing committees to carry out the work of verifying personnel, clearing warehouses, and streamlining institutions. Lanzhou City established a ten-member verification committee on March 5, with Wang Shitai, Political Commissar of the Gansu Military Region and a certain corps, and Yan Kuiyao, Chief of Staff of the First Field Army, serving as director and deputy director respectively, to carry out the verification of organs and troops in Lanzhou City. The organs and troops in the city have now been preliminarily verified. Since February 1, the troops under the Northwest Military Region have responded to the call of the Northwest Military and Political Committee to "save one tael of rice per person per day" to conserve and relieve disasters. A certain regiment stationed in Xinjiang saved 1,236 jin of rice in seven days under extremely difficult circumstances, and provided relief to 74 impoverished families. Various units have freed up horses for production. A certain corps saved more than 14,000 horses; a certain unit stationed in Ningxia organized its own livestock to transport coal, which can save more than 180 million yuan (old currency). All agencies above the division level in the entire military region have implemented collective office work, food and lodging, and extracted miscellaneous service personnel for production. Many troops have begun to grind their own flour. A certain unit stationed in Qinghai used to exchange wheat for flour, but now plans to repair a water mill to grind flour, which can save more than 11,000 shi of grain throughout the year, enough for the unit to eat for more than a month. The units have also studied and reformed stoves and kangs (platform beds) to save coal. After improving the stove and kang, the Fourth Company of a certain unit reduced coal consumption from 2.5 jin per person per day to only 0.55 jin per person per day. In order to prevent electricity waste, the Political Department of a certain corps put forward the "three no" slogan: no lights before dark, no lights when people are not present, and no lights after going to bed.

　　西北军区暨第一野战军
    点验人员清理物资
    驻新青甘宁各部认真节米节煤
    【新华社兰州二十六日电】人民解放军西北军区暨第一野战军已开始进行点验人员和清理物资的工作，并继续贯彻节约的精神，获得良好的成绩。自政务院及中共中央指示统一国家财经工作后，西北军区和第一野战军各兵团及军已先后成立了点验委员会和物资清理委员会，进行点验人员、清理仓库和精简机构等工作。兰州市已于三月五日成立以甘肃军区兼某兵团政委王世泰、第一野战军参谋长阎揆要分任正副主任的十人点验委员会，执行兰州市机关部队的点验事宜。现该市机关部队已初步点验完毕。西北军区所属各部队从二月一日即响应西北军政委员会“部队每人每天节约一两米”的节约救灾的号召。驻新疆某团在极度困难的环境下，七天即省米一千二百三十六斤，共救济七十四家贫苦群众。各部已腾出马匹投入生产，某兵团即省出一万四千余匹；驻宁夏某部自己组织牲口驮煤，可省人民币一亿八千余万元。全军区师以上机关均实行集体办公、食宿，抽出杂勤人员进行生产。许多部队都开始自己磨面。驻青海某部过去用麦换面，现拟自修水磨磨面，全年可省粮食一万一千余市石，够该部一个多月的吃粮。各部又研究改造炉炕，以节省烧煤。某部四连改进炉炕后，由每人每天烧煤二斤五两，省到每人每天仅烧五两半。某兵团政治部为防止用电浪费，提出天不黑不点灯、人不在不点灯、睡觉后不点灯的“三不点”口号。
