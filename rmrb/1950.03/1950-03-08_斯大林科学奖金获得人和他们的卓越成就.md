　　Stalin Prize Winners and Their Outstanding Achievements
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Soviet scientific workers who won the Stalin Prize have achieved outstanding results. According to TASS dispatches: Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, stated: Soviet astronomers have made new achievements in studying the origin, composition, and evolution of celestial bodies; physicists have analyzed molecular vibration processes and studied the characteristics of high-speed rotating electrons; in mathematics, there are important works on geometry and the application of differential equation theory in elasticity; in architecture, there are works on liquid crystals that are of great importance to salt-based metallurgical processes; in chemistry, there are studies on the nitration of hydrocarbons and on absorption, plastics, research on the combustion process of carbon, and explanations of the truth about the manufacturing process of photographic sensitive emulsions, showing great progress in theoretical chemistry. Regarding the history of science, there are three excellent works: "History of Russian Chemical Technology and Chemical Industry," "History of Russian Microscopes and Microscopic Research in the 18th Century," and "History of Russian Electrical Technology."
    Kaftanov, Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union and Vice Chairman of the Stalin Prize Committee for Science and Inventions, stated: Soviet scientists' research on the principles of elasticity and plasticity in metallurgy and mechanics is extremely important for industrial development, including the study of the thermal properties of water vapor under high pressure and high temperature completed under the leadership of Professor Timroth. The oldest Soviet geologist, Okhruchev, the author of "History of Geological Research in Siberia," received the prize, and biologists also received prizes for their research on increasing livestock breeding rates. The winners also include anthropologist Gerasimov, who invented a new theory of reconstructing faces based on skulls; anthropologist Okladnikov, who discovered Paleolithic human bone fossils and utensils; historical linguist Kiselev (one of the three Soviet scholars who came to China to lecture) and his book "Ancient History of Southern Siberia"; historian Basik and his book "Nomadic Periods of the Three Peoples," which discusses the ancient history and development of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian peoples.
    The winners in the Soviet medical field include: Professor Bogoraz and his book "Restorative Surgery," who has achieved remarkable results in treating underdeveloped organs, bone setting, and surgical methods for treating paralysis; the late Professor Deyanarise was posthumously awarded the Stalin Prize for his successful solution to the treatment of bronchial fistulas. Professor Stuyko's book "Surgical Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis" summarizes his rich achievements of more than 30 years. Professor Bubrichenko's book discusses postpartum infections and their treatment: Professor Andriyev has been using long-term sleep to treat internal diseases for six years, and has achieved effectiveness in treating ulcers, high blood pressure, and other diseases with this method, breaking the popular view that long-term sleep can only treat mental illnesses.
    The winners also include: Baisurova, an agronomist from Kazan, who cultivated naked rye that can resist frost in winter and drought in summer; Krasichikov, a Tajik breeder, cultivated a cotton variety that increased fiber production by 23%; DieDieLieFu cultivated a northern variety of sweet cherry that previously only grew in the south. Designers and workers of agricultural machinery factories, such as Volkov, manufactured cotton picking machines, which can do the work of forty cotton pickers per day; Kuchichev of the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute invented a three-horsepower small tractor for orchards or tobacco fields; Ukrainian breeder Kirichenko cultivated the Lebedinskaya dairy cow, whose products are no less than the world's best Kostromskaya cow; Kazakh collective farmers cultivated new breeds of sheep; veterinarian Ivanov invented a typhoid vaccine for young animals, which has been applied to animal husbandry.

　　斯大林科学奖金获得人和他们的卓越成就
    【新华社北京七日电】苏联荣获斯大林的奖金科学工作者成绩卓异。综合塔斯社电讯：苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫谈称：苏联天文学家在研究天体的起源、组成及演变过程上获有新的成就；物理学家分析了分子震动过程，并研究高速转动的电子的特性；数学方面有几何学的重要著作及弹性体力学中微分方程式理论的应用；建筑学上有对盐基冶金过程有巨大重要性的液体结晶的著作；化学方面，则有碳氢化合物的硝化和关于吸收、塑胶的研究，关于碳的燃烧过程的研究和关于照相感光乳剂制造过程的真象的解释，显示理论化学的极大进展。关于科学史的则有“俄罗斯化学工艺与化学工业史”，“十八世纪俄罗斯显微镜与显微镜研究史”，和“俄罗斯电气技术史”等三部优异的著作。
    苏联高等教育部部长兼科学与发明斯大林奖金委员会副主席卡夫坦诺夫谈称：苏联科学家在冶金和机械学的弹性与可塑性原理上的研究，对工业发展极为重要，这包括了第姆罗特教授领导下所完成的高压与高温下水蒸气的热的性能的研究。苏联最老的地质学家“西伯利亚地质研究史”的作者奥赫鲁切夫获得奖金，生物学家在增加牲畜繁殖率方面的研究也获得了奖金。获奖者还有人类学家捷拉西佐夫，他发明根据头骨再造脸型的新理论；人类学家奥克兰尼科夫，他发现了旧石器时代的人骨化石及器皿；历史语言学家吉谢列夫（按即系来我国讲学的三位苏联学者之一）及其著作“西伯利亚南部古代史”；历史学家巴西克及其著作“三民族各游牧时期”，他论述了俄罗斯、乌克兰和白俄罗斯人民古代史及其发展。
    苏联医学界获奖人有：波哥拉兹教授及其著作“恢复性外科学”，他在医治发育不全的器官，接骨正骨及医治瘫痪的手术方法上成绩卓著；已故的德雅纳里赛教授因曾成功地解决了枝气管瘘的治疗而被追赠斯大林奖金。斯陶伊科教授的著作“肺结核病的外科治疗”，总结了他三十余年的丰富成果。布布里欠科教授的著作论述产后传染及其治疗：安德里也夫教授应用长期间睡眠医治内部病症已有六年，并以此方法医治溃疡、血压高及其他病症上获得的效验，打破了长期睡眠只能医治精神病症的流行观点。
    获奖人还有：喀山的农学家巴伊朱罗娃，她培育出能在冬季抗霜夏季抗旱的裸麦；塔吉克选种学家克拉西契科夫培育了增产纤维百分之二十三的棉花品种；迭迭列夫培育了以前仅在南方生长的甜樱桃的北方变种。农业机器厂的设计师和工人伏尔科夫等人制造了摘棉机，每天可作四十个摘棉工人的工作；农业机器研究所的库齐切夫发明用于果园或烟草地的三马力小拖拉机；乌克兰育种学家基里琴科培育了列比丁斯卡娅乳牛，产品不亚于世界最优的科斯特罗斯卡娅牛；哈萨克集体农民培育出新种绵羊；兽医伊凡诺夫发明的供幼兽用的抗伤寒症疫苗，已应用于牧畜业。
