    Congress Allocates Funds for Biological and Chemical Warfare Research
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] The American Army Department is actively strengthening its heinous research and preparation for germ and poison gas warfare. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 17th: The US Army Department, in addition to constantly publicizing the progress and importance of biological and chemical warfare, has recently requested Congress to allocate 10 million US dollars to establish new chemical corps equipment, 6 million US dollars for biological warfare research, and nearly 10 million US dollars for chemical corps research expenses. The dispatch also stated that the Army is strengthening its biological and chemical offensive and defensive tactics, and believes that this is only part of secret warfare. This shows that the US Army Department is still researching other secret weapons for large-scale slaughter of mankind.
