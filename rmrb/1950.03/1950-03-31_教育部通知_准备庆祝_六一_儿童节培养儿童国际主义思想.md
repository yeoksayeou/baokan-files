　　Ministry of Education Notice
    Preparing to Celebrate "June 1st" Children's Day to Cultivate Children's Internationalist Ideology
    Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has issued a notice on celebrating "June 1st" Children's Day to announce the abolition of the old "April 4th" Children's Day and the establishment of the new "June 1st" Children's Day. The full text is as follows:
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has decided to change the Children's Day to June 1st every year. The original June 1st was designated as International Children's Day by the International Democratic Women's Federation Council at its meeting in November 1949. It has a profound and significant meaning for cultivating children's internationalist thought and enhancing the friendship of children from all countries.
    Now the Chinese people have overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved unprecedented great victories, and established the People's Republic of China and their own Central People's Government. The children of our people, our new generation, have become the little masters of the new China and have established fraternal and close relationships with the children of the working people all over the world. In order to cultivate the internationalist thinking of the majority of children, we should, in accordance with the regulations of the State Council of the Central People's Government, regard the June 1st International Children's Day as our country's Children's Day and abolish the old "April 4th Children's Day."
    Schools across the country should hold celebrations on this year's June 1st Children's Day in various ways suitable for local children, and expand publicity about the persecution of Chinese children by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and educate children with internationalist ideas by comparing the living conditions of children in colonial and semi-colonial countries with those in socialist and new democratic countries.
    From now on, the celebration of Children's Day should be held on June 1st every year. It is hoped that schools across the country will follow this.

　　教育部通知
    准备庆祝“六一”儿童节培养儿童国际主义思想
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府教育部为宣布废除旧的“四四”儿童节规定新的“六一”儿童节，顷发表关于庆祝“六一”儿童节的通告。全文如下：
    中央人民政府政务院曾决定将儿童节改定在每年的六月一日。原来六月一日，是国际民主妇联理事会在一九四九年十一月开会时决定的国际儿童节日。它对于培养儿童们的国际主义思想，增进各国儿童们的友谊，有着深长而重大的意义。
    现在中国人民已经推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，取得了空前伟大的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国和自己的中央人民政府。我全国人民的子女，我们新生的一代，作了新中国的小主人，并且与全世界劳动人民的儿童，建立起兄弟般的亲密关系。为了培养广大儿童的国际主义思想，我们应该遵照中央人民政府政务院的规定，将六一国际儿童节作为我国的儿童节，而废除旧的“四四儿童节”。
    全国各地的学校，在今年的六一儿童节，应用各种适合于当地儿童的方式，举行庆祝，并扩大宣传帝国主义及国民党反动派曾对中国儿童们的迫害，并以殖民地半殖民地国家的与社会主义国家、新民主主义国家的儿童生活情况的对照，以国际主义的思想教育儿童们。
    今后儿童节的庆祝，应定在每年六月一日举行，希全国各地学校遵照办理。
