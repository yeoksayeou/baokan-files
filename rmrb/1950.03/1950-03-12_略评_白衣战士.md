　　A Brief Review of "White-Clad Warriors"
　　Zou Difan
    "White-Clad Warriors" is a film that sings the praises of figures of light.

    This film is different from ordinary films. It doesn't use bizarre and tortuous stories or scenes of joys and sorrows of male and female love to set off these new people. It simply uses work and life, that is, the work and life of the field medical team, to portray the firm and brave image of the "white-clad warriors." Their work and life take the real course of the War of Liberation as the background. I think this is the reason for its success.

    The entire film firmly grasps this point:

    For example, at the beginning of the film, the Kuomintang sabotages the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and attacks the Liberated Areas, forcing the People's Liberation Army to transfer. How is the field medical team doing their work?

    Let's first listen to this dialogue:

    Political Commissar: "This transfer is an emergency. We must be especially considerate of the suffering of the wounded and sick, ensure food and drink on the road, and safely reach our destination."

    Associate: "Okay, we will definitely complete the task!"

    Political Commissar: "Captain Zhuang, are there any difficulties?"

    Zhuang Yi: "No difficulties."

    The subsequent scenes are of the night and the wind and rain, the muddy mountain roads where the field medical team members escort the wounded to other places. We see Zhuang Yi carrying a lantern, illuminating the stretcher team.

    The field medical team is transferring under the pursuit of the Kuomintang army and the air raids of airplanes. The successful transfer of the field medical team also proves the success of the PLA's transfer. As the strategy pointed out, the strongholds are lost, but the people are retained. The strongholds can still be captured. This was also the case in the early stage of the three-and-a-half-year War of Liberation.

    What is shown during this period? Mainly the combination of the medical team and the people, the brave behavior of the medical team members in rescuing the wounded under all difficult conditions, etc.

    When the film lens shows the counter-offensive declaration in the newspaper, the war adopts positional warfare, fighting hard battles, and seizing bunkers. The medical team members are also working in such a battlefield.

    Afterwards, we see Captain Zhuang accepting the medal. There she sincerely says: "I think this way, if it weren't for you (referring to the People's Liberation Army), how could we come to this beautiful city, this beautiful building to attend a meeting!"

    People see that the person speaking these words is a captain who was injured while rescuing the wounded during the transfer of the team, braving the bombing of enemy planes; a captain who fell ill due to overwork during positional warfare; such a heroic figure who "rescues the dying and heals the wounded and practices revolutionary humanitarianism," but who treats her glory so plainly and modestly. People will be educated by her extremely short statement.

    Then came the greater march. At this time, the team is not only different from the past transfer situation in terms of equipment, but also the soldiers' conviction in victory is more firm. The accompanying music is a bright and brilliant march.

    Moreover, if you are not a careless viewer, the characters in it should be seen as being in real life. Needless to say, all the medical operations, the way the medical team gets along with the soldiers and the people, make you feel close to the real heroes of our time, and even small movements, you should see how the actors are integrated into the personality of the new people. For example, after Captain Zhuang is injured, she leaves the room at night to see the ward. Before leaving the room, a small movement, turning down the light, this small movement shows such a heroine in many ways.

    Secondly, I think this is one of the films that can be truly accepted by the people. Basically, of course, because this film shows a part of the War of Liberation that is inseparable from the people, but attention should also be paid to some of the director's techniques in handling the shots. In particular, many contrasting pictures powerfully stimulate your impression. For example: during the transfer period, when enemy planes attack, the People's Liberation Army can only dodge, but during positional warfare, anti-aircraft guns aim at enemy planes. For example, the Kuomintang home-returning corps hangs looted chickens and ducks on horseback, but the medical team's cooks transport their own chickens for the wounded. For example, the Kuomintang's horses step on children, but the medical team carries the wounded, their footsteps stepping on the muddy ground. For example, when entering positional warfare, on the march, Yang Mingqing, with only one arm left, shakes hands with many people, while the Kuomintang soldiers with two arms raise their guns to surrender. For example, when the wounded are in a bad mood and misunderstandings occur with the newly joined medical staff, the educational work for both the wounded and the new team members, etc. Undoubtedly, this direct contrast is easiest for the public to accept.

    The War of Liberation shown in the film is an education for all people who have not directly participated in the battle. The service spirit of the medical staff shown in this film should be able to shock those who are lazy at work and numb in their minds. This film shows a heroic model of collectivism, which can ideologically enable us to take a step forward. Of course, there are still some shortcomings in the structure of the script, but we should affirm its educational significance.

### 略评“白衣战士”

　　略评“白衣战士”
    邹荻帆
    “白衣战士”是一部歌颂光明人物的影片。
    这部影片，和一般影片是不同的，它并没有用离奇曲折的故事，以及男女爱情的悲欢离合的场面来衬托这些新人，它只是用工作和生活，那就是野战医疗队的工作与生活，来刻画出“白衣战士”坚毅勇敢的形象。他们的工作与生活是以真实的解放战争的历程作为背景的。我以为这就是它的成功的原因。
    全部影片，是紧紧抓住这一点的：
    譬如电影一开始时，是国民党破坏政协决议，进攻解放区，人民解放军被迫转移，这是一个艰苦阶段。野战医疗队是怎样在做他们的工作呢？
    我们先听这种对话：
    政委：“这次转移，情况紧急，要特别体贴伤病员的痛苦，保证路上的饮食，安全达到目的地。”
    协理员：“好的，我们一定完成任务！”
    政委：“庄队长，有什么困难吗？”
    庄毅：“没有什么困难。”
    以后的镜头是黑夜和狂风急雨，泥泞的山路上野战医疗队员们，护送伤员转移到他地去。我们看见庄毅提着马灯，在照着担架队。
    野战医疗队，是在国民党军的追击及飞机的空袭下转移，从野战医疗队转移的成功，也正证明着解放军转移的成功。正如战略上所指明的，据点失去，人保留着，据点依然是可以夺取过来的，三年半解放战争的初期也就是如此。
    就在这一段时期中表现了什么呢？主要是医疗队和人民结合的情形，医疗队员在一切困难条件下抢救伤员的勇敢行为等。
    当电影镜头出现了报纸上的反攻宣言后，这时战争采取了阵地战，打硬仗，夺地堡，医疗队员也就是在这样的战地在工作。
    过后我们又看到庄队长接受奖章的姿态，在那里她真诚地说：“我倒是这样想，若是没有你们（指解放军），我们哪能到这漂亮的城市，这漂亮的大楼来开会呢！”
    人们看到讲这话的人是一个在队伍转移时，冒着敌机的轰炸，因为抢救伤员而受过伤的队长，在打阵地战时，因为工作疲劳而病倒过的队长，是这样一个“救死扶伤实行革命的人道主义”的英雄人物，但又是这样平白而谦虚地对待自己的光荣。人们是会从她的这句极其简短的语句里受到教育的。
    接着是更大的进军。这时的队伍不只是在装备上与过去转移情况不同，而且战士们对胜利的确信也表现得更加坚定了。配合的音乐是光明灿烂的进行曲。
    而且如果你不是一个粗心的观客，这里面的人物应该看到是怎样在真实的生活中。不用说那一切医疗的手术，那医疗队与战士和人民相处的情形，使你觉得是接近了我们时代的真实的英雄，而且即使微小的动作，你也该看到演员是怎样溶进在新人们的人格中，譬如庄队长伤后，夜晚离房去看病房，在离房之前一点小的动作，把灯火扭小，这一点小动作是多方面表现了这样一个女英雄的。
    其次，我以为这是真正能为人民大众接受的电影之一。基本上当然因为这部影片是表现了与人民不可分离的解放战争的一部分，但是也应该注意到导演处理镜头的一些手法。特别是很多对比的画面，很有力地在激动你的印象，举例来说：譬如在转移时期敌机来袭时，解放军只有闪避，而当阵地战时，高射炮却瞄准敌机了。又譬如国民党还乡团在马背上挂着抢劫的鸡鸭，医疗队的炊事员却为了伤员将自己喂养的鸡运走。又譬如国民党的马蹄从孩童的身上踏过，医疗队却抬着伤员脚步踏着乱泥。又譬如进入阵地战时，在进军的路上，只剩下一只手臂的杨明清和很多人握手，而两只手臂的国民党军却双手举枪就俘。又譬如当伤员因情绪不好，与新参加工作的医疗员发生误会时，对伤员与新队员同时的教育工作等。无疑的，这种直接对比的表现，对大众是最易于接受的。
    影片上所显示的解放战争，对一切没有直接参加过战斗的人们是一种教育。这影片上所显示的医疗员的服务精神，应该能够使工作懒惰、思想麻痹的人受到震撼，这影片显示了集体主义的英雄典型，这是在思想上能够使我们提高一步的。当然，在剧本的结构方面，它还存在一些缺点，但我们应该肯定它的教育意义。
