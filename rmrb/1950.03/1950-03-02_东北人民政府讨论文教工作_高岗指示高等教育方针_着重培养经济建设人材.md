　　Northeast People's Government Discusses Cultural and Educational Work
    Gao Gang Issues Instructions on Higher Education Policy, Emphasizing the Training of Personnel for Economic Construction
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches from] Northeast: The Northeast People's Government held its fifth administrative meeting on the tenth of this month. The meeting discussed the cultural and educational work in the Northeast region. Chairman Gao Gang pointed out in his final summary of the meeting: The central task of the Northeast at present is economic construction. Economic construction is the material foundation of cultural construction. Only a cultural construction upsurge based on an economic construction upsurge is truly powerful and sustainable. In order to accomplish the task of economic construction, the current policy of higher education in the Northeast is to focus on training personnel for economic construction (especially industrial construction personnel) to serve economic construction. To this end, it is necessary to develop higher education in a planned and step-by-step manner. The educational tasks and enrollment plans of colleges and above should be unified and stipulated based on the principles of streamlining and standardization, and students should be enrolled in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner. Attention should be paid to the quality of students, and the quality of teachers must also be improved. At present, the focus of higher education in the Northeast region is to run industrial universities and industrial technical schools well. The Cultural and Educational Committee and the Education Department of the Northeast People's Government should strengthen their leadership in the teaching principles, plans, and academic systems of various specialized schools. As for the daily administrative leadership, the relevant departments should be responsible for running their respective schools well. The heads of various departments must pay attention to this work and conscientiously run the schools under their jurisdiction well. The Ministry of Education should establish a supervisory system to strictly inspect the teaching situation in schools in various places.
    Regarding the issue of opening workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools, Chairman Gao Gang pointed out: We must run them, and we must seize the time to do it. At present, the main target of training should be cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds and industrial workers with a considerable level of education. The Northeast Ministry of Education should make concrete plans and be responsible for leadership. Regarding the literacy campaign, pilot projects can be carried out with emphasis at present, and they should be linked to local production units and mass organizations, and carried out cautiously and steadily to gain experience so that they can be promoted in the future.
    The meeting discussed the "Decision on the Current Higher Education Work in the Northeast Region," the "Decision on Establishing Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools," the "Decision on Conducting Literacy Campaigns on a Trial Basis to Improve Mass Culture," the "Provisional Regulations on the Organizational Work Network of Cultural Networks," the "Provisional Measures for Supporting, Rewarding, and Reorganizing Private Middle Schools," and the "Instructions on Developing Technical Schools" and other documents. The Cultural and Educational Committee and the Education Department were instructed to revise them according to the opinions discussed at the meeting, and then submit them to the Central People's Government for approval and implementation after being reviewed by the Northeast People's Government.

    【本报讯】东北消息：东北人民政府于本月十日举行第五次行政会议。会中讨论了东北区文化教育工作问题。高岗主席在会议最后总结中指出：东北当前的中心任务是经济建设。经济建设是文化建设的物质基础。只有在经济建设高潮基础上的文化建设高潮才是真正的、有力量的，才能持久。为了完成经济建设这一任务，目前东北高等教育的方针就是着重培养经济建设人材（特别是工业建设人材），为经济建设服务。为此，必须有计划有步骤地发展高等教育，应根据精干与正规化的原则，统一规定专科以上学校的教育任务与招生计划，有计划、有重点、有步骤地招收学生。要注意学生质量；教员质量亦必须提高。目前东北区高等教育的重点，是办好工业大学、工业技术专门学校。对各种专科学校，东北人民政府文教委员会和教育部要在教学方针、计划、学制上加强领导；至于经常行政业务领导，则责成各该有关部门负责。各部首长必须看重这一工作，切实把所属学校办好。教育部应建立督学制，严格检查各地学校教学情况。
    关于开办工农速成中学问题，高岗主席指出：我们一定要办，并且要抓紧时间去作。目前培养对象主要应是工农出身的干部及有相当文化程度的产业工人。由东北教育部具体筹划，负责领导。关于识字运动，目前可有重点地进行试办，并应与当地生产单位、群众组织相联系，谨慎地、稳当地进行，取得经验，以便将来推广。
    会议讨论了：关于东北区目前高等教育工作的决定，创办工农速成中学的决定，试行开展识字运动提高群众文化的决定，文化网的组织工作网要试行条例，扶持、奖励、整理私立中学暂行办法，以及关于发展技术学校的指示等文件。并责成文教委员会和教育部根据会议讨论意见进行修正，经东北人民政府审核后再报请中央人民政府核准施行。
