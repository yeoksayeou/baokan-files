　　Beijing State-Owned Department Store's Second Store Opens
　　Citizens Eager to Buy
　　[Beijing News] The second store of the Beijing State-Owned Department Store's First Branch has been very popular with citizens since its opening on the 5th of this month, and shoppers have been very enthusiastic. The store is located at the former site of the Zhongyuan Company on Wangfujing Street. Daily necessities such as enamelware, food, and sneakers are generally sold with a profit margin of only 5% to 10%. On the first day of opening, sales reached more than 100 million yuan, with more than 6,000 customers. The masses are reflecting that this is truly a people's store, no longer filled with the luxury goods favored by a few, as was the case with the Zhongyuan Company in the past.
　　In addition: The company is preparing to extensively expand consignment sales in a portion of the rear building of the First Branch that has been vacated, in order to support manufacturers' production.

　　京国营百货公司第二商场开幕
    市民踊跃购货
    【北京讯】北京市国营百货公司第一门市部第二商场，自本月五日开幕以来，颇受市民欢迎，前往购货者十分踊跃。该商场设在王府井大街中原公司旧址，所售搪瓷、食品、球鞋等日用品一般只取利润百分之五至百分之十，开幕的第一天售款即达一亿多元，户头六千多。群众都反映；这才是人民的商店，再不像过去中原公司那样充满了少数人所爱好的奢侈品了。
    又：该公司腾出的第一门市部后楼一部分，准备大量展开代销，扶植厂商生产。
