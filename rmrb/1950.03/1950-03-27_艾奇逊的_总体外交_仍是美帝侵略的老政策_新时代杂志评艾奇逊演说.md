　　Acheson's "Total Diplomacy" is Still the Old Policy of American Imperialist Aggression
    *New Era* Magazine Reviews Acheson's Speech
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th] TASS, Moscow, March 23rd: The *New Era* magazine recently published an article by Rovinsky, commenting on Acheson's recent speeches in Washington, San Francisco, and Berkeley, stating: Acheson had to make a great fanfare because the State Department's bankrupt and disastrous policy had been thoroughly understood by millions of Americans. This is what Acheson's Republican enemies, as well as many of his Democratic friends, are openly talking about.

　　Relying entirely on military strength, "creating situations of strength," and preparing for a "life-and-death struggle" - this is the ABC of "Total Diplomacy" as explained by Acheson himself.

　　Acheson's analysis of the world situation in support of his "seven points" is crudely fabricated according to primitive formats.

　　Acheson's speech is full of distortions of facts and attempts to reverse black and white. No matter what label Acheson attaches to this "Total Diplomacy," it is still the old policy of American imperialism's force, economic expansion, and military aggression. In his recent speech, Acheson did not even mention the Soviet Union's unconditional proposal to ban atomic weapons and establish strict international control to ensure the enforcement of the ban. It is easy to understand why he maintains such cautious silence on this point: his "Total Diplomacy" aims to implement the notorious "Baruch Plan," which in practice means establishing control by American monopoly capital over the atomic energy production of various countries.

　　The conditions put forward in Secretary of State Acheson's seven "decrees" indicate that the cornerstone of the diplomatic policy of the American rulers remains aggression, and aggression on a scale even greater than before. This shows that the drafters of these conditions have not understood a single thing, nor learned a single lesson. They are still drawing inspiration from Forrestal (the late US Secretary of Defense, who went mad due to continuous failures in his anti-Soviet policy and finally committed suicide by jumping off a building in the early summer of last year), still fantasizing that they can wave existing atomic bombs and hypothetical hydrogen bombs to force the Soviet Union and the entire socialist and democratic camp to submit to them. However, enough time has passed for them to realize that the policy of coercion and threats does not work against the Soviet Union.

### 艾奇逊的“总体外交”仍是美帝侵略的老政策  新时代杂志评艾奇逊演说

　　艾奇逊的“总体外交”仍是美帝侵略的老政策
    新时代杂志评艾奇逊演说
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：新时代杂志顷刊载罗文斯基所撰文章，评论艾奇逊最近在华盛顿、旧金山与巴克莱三地发表的演说称：艾奇逊不得不大放厥词，因为国务院已经破产的、易于招致灾难性的政策，已经为千百万美国人民洞悉无遗了。这就是艾奇逊的共和党敌手，以及他的许多民主党的朋友正在公开谈论的事情。
    完全依靠军事力量，“创造有实力的情况”，准备“生死斗争”——这就是艾奇逊本人阐明的“总体外交”的三字经。
    艾奇逊为了支持他的“七点”而对世界局势所作的分析，是按照原始的格式粗制滥造出来的。
    艾奇逊的演说充满了对事实的歪曲与颠倒黑白的企图。这种“总体外交”无论艾奇逊贴上什么标签，它仍然是美国帝国主义的武力、经济扩张与军事侵略的老政策。艾奇逊在他最近的演说中，竟然没有提及苏联的无条件禁用原子武器，建立严格的国际管制以保证禁令的执行等建议。他为什么对这一点保持谨慎的沉默，是很容易了解的：他的“总体外交”目的在实行臭名昭彰的“巴鲁区计划”，这个计划实际上意味着建立美国垄断资本对各国原子能制造的管制。
    国务卿艾奇逊的七点“律令”中提出的条件表明：美国统治者的外交政策的基石，仍然是侵略，而且是规模比以前更加大的侵略。这说明了这些条件的拟制者没有懂得一点事情，没有学到一点教训。他们仍然从福莱斯特尔（已故美国国防部长，他因反苏政策连续遭受失败而发疯，终于去年夏初跳楼自杀身死。）那里吸取灵感，还在幻想他们可以挥舞现有的原子弹和假想中的氢弹来迫使苏联与整个社会主义与民主阵营向他们屈膝。但是，过去的时间已足够使他们认识高压和威胁的政策，对苏联是不起作用的。
