　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th – More than 400 literary and art workers from Wuhan and Hubei Province are going to the countryside and factories to launch a literary and art movement in rural areas and factories. Since the closing of the Central South China Literary and Art Work Conference on February 10th, literary and art workers in various parts of Central South China have been actively carrying out various arrangements and preparations for going to the countryside and factories, in accordance with the literary and art work policy of "facing the factories, facing the countryside, popularization first, and taking root first." Literary and art workers participating in rural work have also studied land reform policies in advance, establishing the idea of resolutely serving the peasants. More than 200 cadres from units such as the Central South China Literary Work Troupe, the Zhongyuan University Literary Work Troupe, and the Central South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Wuhan have gone to Henan and Jiangxi provinces to participate in land reform and rent reduction movements.

More than 100 literary and art workers from units such as the Literary Institute of Zhongyuan University in Wuhan, the Central South China Literary Work Troupe, and the literary and art work team affiliated with the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have successively gone deep into factories to help workers and staff organize literary and art activities. The literary and art workers sent by the Wuhan Municipal People's Education Center to the Shenxin Textile Factory in the city, in addition to helping workers organize literary and art activities, also created more than 100 comic strips reflecting the production and life of workers. These pictures were enthusiastically welcomed by the workers.

　　武汉及鄂省文艺工作者
    四百多人下乡下厂
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】武汉市和湖北省文艺工作者四百多人下乡下厂，展开农村和工厂的文艺运动。自二月十日召开的中南区文艺工作会议闭幕后，中南区各地的文艺工作者即根据“面向工厂、面向农村，普及第一、生根第一”的文艺工作方针，积极进行下乡下厂的各种布置和准备工作。参加农村工作的文艺工作者，事先并进行了关于土地改革政策的学习，确立了坚决为农民服务的思想。武汉的中南文艺工作团、中原大学文艺工作团和中南区文学艺术界联合会等单位的干部二百余人，已经分头到河南、江西两省参加土地改革和减租运动。湖北省的湖北文艺工作团一百多人也将于最近赴该省黄冈、浠水等地，开展农村文艺工作。武汉中原大学文艺学院、中南文艺工作团、武汉市总工会筹委会所属文艺工作队等单位的文艺工作者一百余人则已先后深入工厂，帮助工人、职员组织文艺活动。武汉市人民教育馆派往该市申新纱厂的文艺工作者，除了帮助工人组织文艺活动外，并创作了一百多幅反映工人生产和生活的连环图画，这些图画受到工人们的热烈欢迎。
