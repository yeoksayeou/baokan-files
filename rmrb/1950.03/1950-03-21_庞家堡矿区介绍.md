Introduction to Pangjiabao Mining Area
    Chang Hai
    The Pangjiabao Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine is located 42 kilometers northeast of Xuanhua Station in Chahar Province and belongs to Longguan County. According to the survey report of the "North China Development Co. Research Bureau" of the Japanese invaders from August 20 to September 27, 1942, the mine was discovered in 1913 by Anderson, a German consultant to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining of the Beijing government, in conjunction with a Danish person named McKee, while surveying the Xinyao Iron Mine (belonging to Longguan, 76 kilometers north of Xuanhua Station). The ore deposit belongs to sedimentary rock, sandwiched between Proterozoic siliceous rock layers and siliceous limestone layers. The ore layer is approximately 7.8 kilometers long, with reserves of over 190 million tons, and an annual output of 2 million tons, which can be mined for a hundred years.
    Due to the continuous infighting of the warlords of the Northern Warlord government and the corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang regime, this treasure was never developed. After the July 7th Incident, in order to supply the military needs of their war of aggression, the Japanese invaders used the blood and sweat of countless Chinese compatriots to build modern electrical equipment such as substations, fan rooms, pump rooms, horse-powered railways, tramways, and high-line ore transportation lines, and built the Jing绥 Railway (Xuanhua) Pang (Pangjiabao) branch line to intensify the plunder of this rich resource. At the peak of the Japanese occupation, there were 25,000 workers, with a daily output of 6,000 tons of ore.
    In August 1945, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the area was liberated by the People's Liberation Army. This valuable national defense resource then belonged to the people. However, before long, the area was occupied by the Kuomintang bandit army, which carried out wanton destruction. Houses and machines were destroyed, and tunnels collapsed, turning Pangjiabao into a desolate mountain ruin. At the end of 1948, the area was liberated again. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the destruction of the mine was first stopped, and then active restoration and reconstruction were carried out. Up to now, 85 percent of the old ore transportation roads, tunnels, and ore bins have been repaired. Most of the old water pumps have also been repaired, and many other mining tools such as tramways, motors, mine cars, and pneumatic winches have also been repaired. In 1950, in addition to vigorously carrying out restoration and reconstruction, efforts were also made to produce 80,000 tons of ore.
    The Pangjiabao Mine is divided into three parts: East, Central, and West. According to the Japanese survey (as before), the length of the ore layer is: East 2900 meters, Central 2400 meters, and West 2500 meters. The average thickness of the ore layer is: East 3.28 meters, Central 3.05 meters, and West 2.48 meters. The ore is divided into kidney-shaped (commonly known as grape-shaped) and fish-egg-shaped (commonly known as "red" and "sand," the iron content of the former reaches 62.9 percent, and the latter is at least 52.31 percent, with an average of over 55 percent, with kidney-shaped being the best. According to experienced geological and mining experts, such a rich mine is rare in the world. It is not difficult to predict that Pangjiabao minerals will play an important role in the industrial construction of New China and will contribute its glorious achievements.

　　庞家堡矿区介绍
    长海
    龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场，位于察省宣化车站东北四十二公里处，为龙关县属。据日寇“北支开发会社调查局”一九四二年八月二十日至九月二十七日之调查报告书载，该矿系一九一三年，北京政府农矿部顾问——德人安得森协同丹麦人麦奇参，于测查辛窑（龙关属，宣化车站北七十六公里）铁矿归途中发现。该矿床属水成岩，夹于原生代矽岩层与矽质石灰岩层之间，矿层长度共约七点八公里，埋藏量在一亿九千万吨以上，年产二百万吨，可供百年开采。
    由于当时的统治者——北洋军阀们连年混战，和国民党政权的腐败无能，这一宝藏始终未得开发。七七事变后，日寇为供应其侵略战争的军事需要，用无数中国同胞的血汗，建造起变电所、风机房、水泵房、马机道、电车道、高线运矿道等近代电气设备，并修建京绥铁路（宣化）庞（家堡）支线，加紧掠夺这一富源。日寇统治最盛时，工人达两万五千，日产矿砂六千吨。
    一九四五年八月，日寇投降，该地为人民解放军所解放，这一宝贵的国防资源，乃为人民所有。但为时不久，该地即为国民党匪军侵占，任意进行破坏，房屋机器被毁，坑道坍塌，庞家堡遂变成了一片荒山废墟。一九四八年年底，该地重获解放，在共产党及人民政府领导下，首先制止了对矿山的破坏，继即积极进行恢复与重建。到现在已将旧有运矿道、坑道、隧道、矿槽等修复达百分之八十五。旧有水泵亦大多修复，其他电车道、马达、矿车、风钻绞车等采矿用具，也修复很多。一九五零年除以大力进行修复重建外，并争取产矿八万吨。
    庞家堡矿场分东、中、西三部。据日人调查（同前）矿层走向长度为：东部二九○○公尺，中部二四○○公尺，西部二五○○公尺。矿层平均厚度：东部三点二八公尺，中部三点零五公尺，西部二点四八公尺。矿石分肾状（俗云葡萄状）鱼卵状（俗称米砂“红”二种，含铁量最高达百分之六二点九，最低为百分之五二点三一，平均在百分之五十五以上，以肾状为佳。据有经历的地质、采矿专家们观测，如此富矿，在世界上亦鲜有。不难预计：庞家堡矿产，在新中国工业建设路途中，将起着重要作用，并将贡献出其光辉的成就。
