　　A Good Book
    On "Reference Materials for Stevedore Trade Union Work"
    Wang Chun
    Compiled by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Published by Workers' Publishing House
    An excerpt from this book (by Comrade An Lifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Stevedore Trade Union) has already been published in the Beijing Worker's Daily (March 12, 14, 15). The entire book is a compilation of five "situation investigations," twelve "work reports," five "collective contracts," and two "work summaries," along with five appendices. It totals 150,000 words. The content primarily consists of materials from the Tianjin Stevedore Trade Union. The purpose of compiling this book is clearly stated in the preface written by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions: "Investigation and research (which is the foundation for determining guidelines, tasks, and policies), requests for instructions and reports, and summarizing experiences are three important links and steps in doing any significant work well. The situation of stevedores is more complex than that of workers in other sectors, our understanding of the stevedores' situation is more unfamiliar than our understanding of other sectors, and experience in stevedore trade union work is even more lacking. ... Therefore, we have compiled this booklet, centered on the materials from the Tianjin Stevedore Trade Union, according to the three main items of investigation and research, requests for instructions and reports, and experience summaries."
    This is a good book! It specifically tells us about the complex circumstances of Chinese social life. Let's first copy a vivid description of a type of old stevedore organization called *jiaohang* (porters' guilds) for everyone to see:
    "Their secret organization is called 'Zaiqian de' (Those in the Sign). They usually disperse into various *jiaohang*, and don't do much work, specializing in ruling the workers and preparing for fights. When disputes occur among them, the bosses immediately call back all of those 'Zaiqian de' to discuss fighting. They make signs according to the number of people, writing the words 'death' and 'life' on the signs. When they go to fight, they ask everyone to draw a sign. Those who draw the sign with the word 'death' must die during the fight. If they can't beat the other side, they kill themselves, and the bosses file a lawsuit claiming that the others killed them. Relying on 'black lawyers' and the bosses spending money, they demand that the other side pay with their lives. However, the family of the person who commits suicide is provided for by the entire *jiaohang*. They also collude with the Black Flag Gang. Whoever offends them will have the Black Flag Gang help them fight and kill (before the July 7th Incident, the bosses had a conflict with worker Zhai Da, so they killed a worker themselves and insisted that Zhai Da killed him, using money to buy Zhai Da's death in prison). Now, the godson of the overall boss, Guo Wanchun, named Wang Haishan, is the captain of the Black Flag Gang, specializing in helping them do things."
    As you can see, this is a real thing, and it exists in Tianjin. The most abhorrent aspect of this feudal organization is that their bosses openly divided the country's land into their own "spheres of influence. Merchants, factories, and warehouses within their scope had to use their transportation services, and were not allowed to hire others!" Anyone who dared to hire outside would be subject to a " 'crossing-the-street fee' or 'toll' according to the rules, which would not be less than the cost of hiring. Otherwise, they would not be allowed to leave, or they would be subject to fighting." To avoid trouble, merchants had to obey the rules. And the amount of freight was controlled by the *jiaohang* bosses.
    Internally, they practiced feudal rule and feudal exploitation. "Foreign affairs and liaison were handled by the bosses. Workers had no activity other than providing labor for them to drive." Of the freight fees obtained, "the bosses, who were few in number and did not work, got more than 80 percent! And the workers, who worked hard and were numerous, got very little... so the workers' lives were extremely poor." "Even more, there were bosses who contracted work, and the workers' income depended solely on the bosses' rewards."
    These bosses were also the lower-level foundation of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, so they were mostly members and agents of the Kuomintang. Ba Yanqing, the chairman of the Tianjin Pseudo-Transportation Industry Professional Association, was a member of the Kuomintang's Tianjin Municipal Party Committee. Qu Changrong, the executive director, was the head of the Sanmiao *jiaohang*. In September of the year before last, he was transferred to Nanjing by the Social Work Group of the pseudo-Social Affairs Bureau for training. Xing En'yu and Wang Xuefu, subordinates of Qu Changrong, as well as "these leading bosses, are all in the Green and Red Gangs. The overall head of the Green and Red Gangs is Wang Jinquan. Wang Xuefu is also a plainclothes team member of the pseudo-Tianjin Garrison Command." Wang Xuefu once said: "Killing two people, not sharing the money for three days!" During the bandit-puppet era, they all used the name of the group to handle the Kuomintang's pseudo-National Assembly elections. After liberation, they naturally intensified their espionage activities to sabotage us.
    These bosses carved up territories, enslaved workers, colluded with bandits and puppets, hindered commerce, and even practiced hereditary succession and murder for hire, becoming the darkest and most reactionary feudal forces in the cities and docks. As a result of their feudal rule and cruel exploitation, on the one hand, it gave the stevedores the bad influence of trade unionism, and on the other hand, it forced the hungry and helpless stevedores to do evil. "Rickshaw pullers... after agreeing on a fare, would demand more upon arrival; young workers would not return to the factory at night, gathering to gamble, extort, and so on. Even more, there were members of the Black Flag Gang who used pulling rickshaws as a cover to engage in fraud and theft."
    Tianjin has been liberated for more than a year, and eliminating feudal organizations and feudal bosses, overcoming the workers' guild consciousness, and establishing a new stevedore trade union is an extremely arduous struggle. Our Tianjin Stevedore Trade Union, under the guidance of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, with the assistance of the People's Government, public security departments, trade agencies, and the broad masses of workers, citizens, and industrialists and merchants, has achieved victory after a year of investigation, organization, and struggle. They are based on Chairman Mao's working methods, and they have achieved great achievements and experience. These achievements and experiences should be accepted and utilized by everyone. The middle two parts of this book describe the course of the struggle and the achievements in great detail. I hope that not only trade union workers, but also anyone who is willing to understand Chinese society more specifically, will read this book and learn their working methods.

### 一本好书  谈“搬运工人工会工作参考资料”

　　一本好书
    谈“搬运工人工会工作参考资料”
    王春
    中华全国总工会编  工人出版社出版
    这本书的一篇摘要（中国搬运工会全国委员会主席安力夫同志作），已在北京工人日报（三月十二、十四、十五）发表。全书是汇印的五个“情况调查”、十二个“工作报告”、五个“集体合同”和两篇“工作总结”，还有附录五种。总计十五万言。内容主要是天津搬运工会的材料。编辑这书的宗旨，在中华全国总工会写的序言上说得很明白：“调查研究（这是确定方针任务与政策的基础）、请示报告、总结经验，是作好任何一种比较重大工作的三个重要环节与步骤。搬运工人的情况比较其他部门的工人更为复杂，我们对于搬运工人情况的了解比较对其他部门的工人更为生疏，关于搬运工会工作经验则更加缺乏。……为此我们就以天津搬运工会的材料为中心，按照调查研究、请示报告与经验总结等三个主要项目，编了这个小册子。”
    这是一本好书！它具体地告诉了我们中国社会生活的复杂情况。先抄一段关于旧搬运组织里边的一种叫做脚行的生动的叙述让大家看：
    “其秘密组织名为‘在签的’，平时分散到各个脚行中去，也不大做工，专统治工人和准备打架。如他们之中发生纠纷时，头子们即把他们‘在签的’悉数调回去，讨论打架。按人数造成签子，签上写上死活二字；临去打时叫大家抽签，抽住死字的，即打时一定要死的，如打不过人家，即自己把自己杀死，头子们去打人命官司，就说是人家打死的。仗着‘黑律师’和头子们花钱，也要叫人家偿命。但自杀的这个人的家属供给，由整个脚行负责。并和黑旗队勾连。谁要得罪了他们，就叫黑旗队帮助他们打架和杀人（在七七事变前头子们和工人翟大不合，他们就自己杀了个工人，硬说是翟大杀的，用钱把翟大买死在狱里）。现在总头郭万春的干儿子名王海山，是黑旗队的大队长，专帮助他们作事。”
    大家看，这是真实的事，这就存在于天津。这种封建组织最可恶的地方，是他们的头子们公然把国家的土地分割为自己的“势力范围，在其范围内之商民、工厂、货栈，运输物资，必须由其运输，不准另雇他人！”谁敢外雇，“如经发现，照规矩索‘过街钱’‘买路钱’，其数目也不小于雇用费；否则不准拉走或打架斗殴。商民为了免除麻烦，只好遵从规矩。而运费多寡，遂操诸脚行头之手。”
    在其内部，则实行封建统治与封建剥削，“对外交涉事务连络，均由头子负责，工人除出劳力供驱使外，别无活动”。所得运费，“头子人数少，不劳动，反得百分之八十以上！而工人劳动，人数多，反得数甚微，……所以工人生活穷苦异常”。“更有头子包工，工人所得，仅凭头子赏与”的。
    这些头子们也就是国民党反动统治的下层基础，所以他们大都又是国民党的委员和特务。天津伪运输业职业公会的理事长巴延庆，是国民党天津市党部委员。常务理事屈长荣，是三庙脚行的头子，前年九月，经伪社会局社工组调往南京受训。屈长荣手下的邢恩玉、王学富，以及“为首的这几个头子，均在青、红帮。青红帮总头是王金泉。王学富又是伪天津警备司令部便衣队，”王学富曾这样说过：“打死两人，打着三天不分钱！”他们在匪伪时代，都假借团体名义，包办国民党的伪国大选举。解放后自然是加紧特务活动，破坏我们。
    这些头子们就是这样割据地盘，奴役工人，勾结匪伪，妨碍商业，而且子孙世袭，买命杀人，成为城市、码头上最黑暗最反动的封建势力。由于他们的封建统治和残酷剥削的结果，一方面又给了搬运工人以行会主义的坏影响，一方面则逼使饥寒无告的搬运工人也大都为非作歹。“三轮车工人……坐车说好车价，下车强要增多；青年工人夜不回厂，集聚赌博，强拉勒索，层出不穷。更有以拉三轮为名，实则是进行欺骗、盗窃的黑旗队分子”。
    天津解放已经一年多了，消灭封建组织与封建头子，克服工人的行会意识，建立新的搬运工人工会，这是一件异常艰苦的斗争。我们的天津市搬运工会，在中华全国总工会的方针指导下，取得人民政府、公安部门、贸易机关以及广大的工人、市民和工商业者的协助，经过一年的调查、组织和斗争，现在是已经胜利了。他们根据的是毛主席的工作方法，他们取得了很大的成绩与经验，这些成绩与经验，应该为大家所接受与运用。关于斗争的经过和成绩的报导，此书的中间两部分讲的非常详细。我希望不只工会工作者，就是一般愿意更多更具体了解中国社会的人，也读一下这本书，并且学习他们的工作方法。
