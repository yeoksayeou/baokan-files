A Gas Explosion Occurred at the State-Owned Henan Yiluo Coal Mine
The Central Supervisory Committee Has Sent Personnel to Investigate
Coal Mines in Various Regions Should Raise Serious Vigilance

[Reported by this newspaper's reporter Chen Baisheng] A tragic gas explosion and fire occurred at the Henan Yiluo Coal Mine, resulting in the deaths of 130 miners and injuries to 47 miners (accounting for more than one-half of all miners at the mine).

At approximately 6:00 PM on February 27th, when more than 300 miners were mining underground, a fireball was discovered erupting from an eastern roadway opening in the mine. Workers went to extinguish the fire. The fireball suddenly exploded, causing coal blocks to collapse, filling the mine with smoke and blocking ventilation. After the incident, above-ground employees immediately used manual ventilation to rescue the trapped workers, and half of the miners were saved from disaster. The mine is currently intensifying its efforts to handle the aftermath for the deceased and injured miners and provide medical care.

After this incident occurred, the relevant authorities attached great importance to it. The Industrial Department of the Central-South Region immediately sent personnel to the mine to investigate the cause of the incident. Upon hearing the report, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Labor, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions formed an Yiluo Coal Mine Accident Investigation Team and went to the scene of the accident on the 8th to conduct an investigation. The Central People's Supervisory Committee has also dispatched a inspection team composed of Peng Da and two others, which departed on the 10th of this month to inspect the mine's management situation, investigate the cause of the fire, study the painful lessons learned, and propose solutions for handling the aftermath, in order to inform the whole country, raise the vigilance of coal mining areas across the country, and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

It is reported that the Yiluo Coal Mine is located 35 kilometers east of Luoyang City, Henan Province, and is a relatively important coal mining area on a branch line of the Longhai Railway. The mine was originally a provincial-operated coal mine in Henan and was converted to state-owned through the Central-South Region Coal Industry Conference last December. The mine's safety equipment is very rudimentary, and mining is semi-manual and semi-mechanized. The mine has more than 300 workers and produces approximately 200 tons of coal per day.

Editor's Note: Recently, unfortunate incidents have occurred frequently in mines across the country, especially coal mines, causing significant losses to state property and workers' lives, which should arouse our serious vigilance. This gas explosion at the state-owned Henan Yiluo Coal Mine has once again caused significant losses. The specific cause of the fire is still under investigation and the results will be announced soon. However, even this preliminary and brief report of the incident is enough to arouse the high attention of mines across the country. Mines in various regions must earnestly find ways to improve leadership and management methods, inspect safety equipment conditions, and strive to prevent the continued occurrence of such unfortunate events.

　　国营河南宜洛煤矿发生瓦斯爆炸事件
    中央监察委员会已派员查究
    各地矿厂亟应提起严重警惕
    【本报讯】记者陈柏生报道：河南省宜洛煤矿发生煤气爆炸失火惨案，死亡矿工一百三十名，伤矿工四十七名（占该矿全体矿工二分之一以上）。
    在二月二十七日下午六时许，当三百余矿工正在井下采煤时，发现井下东边行道口处有火球喷出，工人乃去救火。火球突然爆炸，煤块塌下，矿坑中烟雾弥漫，空气堵塞不能通风。事件发生后，井上员工立即用人力通风，抢救被难工友，半数矿工得免于难。现该矿正在加紧进行死伤工友善后及医疗工作。
    此事件发生后，各有关当局极为重视。中南区工业部当即派人前往该矿调查事件发生原因。中央燃料工业部、劳动部、中华全国总工会等机关闻报，即组成宜洛煤矿事故检查组，于八日前往出事地点进行调查。中央人民监察委员会亦已派彭达等三人组成检查小组，于本月十日前往出事地点检查该矿管理情况，追究失火原因，研究惨痛的经验教训，并提出善后处理办法，以便通报全国，引起各地矿区的警惕，防止类此事件的重复发生。
    按宜洛煤矿在河南洛阳城东三十五公里之处，为陇海路支线上一个较重要煤矿区。该矿原为河南省营煤矿，经去年十二月中南区煤业会议通过改为国营。矿中安全设备十分简陋，为半手工半机器开采。该矿共三百余工人，每天产煤量约二百吨。
    编者按：近来全国各地矿厂，特别是煤矿，屡次发生不幸的事件，使国家财产和工人生命遭受重大损失，应该引起我们严重的警惕。此次国营河南宜洛煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件又一次地造成了重大的损失。该矿失火的具体原因，虽然正在查究，不久即将有结果公布。但从这一事件的初步简略报道中，已经足以唤起各地矿厂的高度注意。各地矿厂亟应切实设法改善领导与管理方法，检查安全设备情形，努力防止此种不幸事件的继续发生。
