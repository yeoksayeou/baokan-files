    Women's Consciousness Reaches Unprecedented Heights, Actively Working and Striving for Production
    [Our Newspaper] After the land reform movement in various villages of the fourteen districts around Beijing, women's consciousness has reached unprecedented heights, and they are actively participating in work and production. During the land reform movement, most women participated in elections, class designation, and land redistribution like men; and waged heroic struggles against landlords, local bullies, and feudal forces. According to statistics from nine villages, 1,001 women have joined farmers' associations or peasant groups, 34 have been elected as peasant representatives or members of farmers' associations, and 73 have been elected as leaders of peasant groups. Zuo Hongrong, a woman from Yinghaizhuang, was elected as a peasant representative during the land reform. She worked actively, and after the land reform, she was elected as the deputy director of the farmers' association and was honorably approved to join the Party. During the land reform movement, 52 women from 23 villages were approved to join the Party, and 138 women joined the New Democratic Youth League. After the completion of the land reform, most women actively participated in sideline and agricultural production. In the whole district, 201 women from 19 villages directly participated in boiling saltpeter. In villages such as Xiyanwo and Nanyangzhuang, most women were making shoe soles. In Huaifang and Nanyuan Town, many women participated in weaving mats, and they played a significant role in self-reliance through production. Currently, 155 women are participating in the work-relief projects of digging canals and harnessing rivers. The women who have been allocated land are even more actively participating in agricultural production.
