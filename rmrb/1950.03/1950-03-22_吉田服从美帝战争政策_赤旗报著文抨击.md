Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, *Red Flag*, published an article on the 16th denouncing the transport of war supplies from Japan to Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and South Korea, as well as Japan's participation in the construction of American military bases on Okinawa. The newspaper also criticized the Japanese government for currently doing its utmost to revive the war industry.

*Red Flag* stated that the Potsdam Declaration prohibits Japan from rearming and becoming a military base, prohibits the revival of war industries, prohibits providing foreign military assistance, and prohibits engaging in the transportation of war materials or Japanese people participating in the construction of military bases outside of Japan. However, war supplies are now being transported to Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and South Korea, and the Japanese government ignores Japanese companies and workers participating in military construction projects in Okinawa. This violates the Potsdam Declaration and is an action against the Soviet Union and New China, as well as an abandonment of the peace policy.

*Red Flag* clearly declared: We are determined to fight against this war preparation by the Yoshida government and to strive for peace.

　　吉田服从美帝战争政策
    赤旗报著文抨击
    【新华社二十一日讯】据美联社东京讯：日本共产党机关报赤旗报十六日撰文抨击从日本运送战争供应品往台湾、东南亚和南朝鲜，及日本参加冲绳岛的美国军事基地建设工程。该报并斥责日本政府现正尽力使战争工业复活。赤旗报称，波茨坦宣言禁止日本重新武装和变为军事基地，禁止复活战争工业，禁止给外国军事援助及从事运输战争物资或日本人参加日本国外军事基地的建设。但是，战争供应品现在却正运往台湾、东南亚和南朝鲜，同时日本政府无视日本公司与日本工人参加冲绳的军事建设工程，这是违反了波茨坦宣言，是反对苏联和新中国以及废弃和平政策的行动。赤旗报明确地宣称：我们坚决地要为反对吉田政府这种战争准备和为争取和平而斗争。
