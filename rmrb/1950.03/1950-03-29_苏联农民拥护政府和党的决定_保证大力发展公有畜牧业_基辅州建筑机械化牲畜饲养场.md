Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th: TASS reports: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Communist Party Central Committee's decision on the implementation procedures for the three-year plan for developing livestock breeding has been warmly supported by collective farmers and state farm workers. On the 24th, mass rallies were held in many collective farms in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other allied republics, where collective farmers pledged to achieve new developments in publicly owned animal husbandry.

The Kaganovich Collective Farm in Kiev Oblast has nearly completed all the quotas stipulated for the final year of the three-year plan. The Red Guerrilla Collective Farm in Kiev Oblast, famous for its highly developed animal husbandry, has exceeded its quotas for increasing livestock numbers and livestock product productivity. Currently, the construction of a large-scale mechanized livestock farm is underway. The construction of the water supply system has been completed, and the trenches, heating, and water supply stations are nearing completion. All production processes on the farm will be powered by electricity. In the Kazakh collective farms, where livestock breeding is the main agricultural sector, livestock are being moved from winter pastures to spring pastures, and the breeding season for cattle and sheep has arrived. People are enthusiastically welcoming the decision of the government and the Party. The decision has also quickly spread to all villages and pastures in Kyrgyzstan.

    基辅州的卡冈诺维奇集体农场，差不多已完成了三年计划最后一年所规定的一切定额。因畜牧业的高度发展而出名的基辅州红色游击队集体农场，已超过其增加牲畜头数及增加牲畜产物生产率的定额。目前，正在完成规模宏大的机械化牲畜饲养场的建设工程。用水供应系统的建设工程已经竣工，沟渠、暖气和自来水站正在完成。饲养场的一切生产过程将用电力进行。在以牲畜饲养为农业主要部门的哈萨克集体农场，正在把牲畜从冬季畜牧场驱至春季牧场，牛羊繁育期已经来临，人们正以高涨的热情迎接政府与党的决定。决定也飞快地传到了吉尔吉斯的一切村庄和牧场上。
