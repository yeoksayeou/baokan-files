　　"The Meeting at the Elbe"

　　The film "The Meeting at the Elbe" depicts the two worlds on the east and west banks of the Elbe River, and the Soviet and American occupation zones of the city of Aldenshtadt, after the defeat of Nazi Germany.

　　In the Soviet occupation zone on the east bank, the Soviet Union helped the German people to eliminate Nazi bandits, destroy munitions factories, restore production, promote the national culture of the German people, and establish a new, democratic, and peaceful Germany. In the American occupation zone on the west bank, the United States "inherited" Hitler's policies, intensifying the plunder and oppression of the German people. From this, we see the stark contrast between the peaceful and democratic foreign policy of the socialist Soviet Union and the aggressive and plundering foreign policy of imperialist America. Such a serious theme is presented in this film with vivid and interesting imagery.

　　There is no third way between the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the imperialist camp headed by the United States. "The Meeting at the Elbe" illustrates this point through the story of scientist Dr. Gitterliher. Initially, Gitterliher was a "middle-of-the-roader" who hated both the Nazis and the Soviets, and he refused to give the patent for his invention, the "Sky Blue Crystal," to the Soviet Union. However, after witnessing the different lives of the German people in the two occupation zones, he resolutely chose a path between the two worlds and sided with the Soviet Union. This is the path of the German people, and it is also the path of the people of the world.

　　"The Meeting at the Elbe" also shows that in imperialist countries, it is only a small number of Wall Street bosses and warlords who attempt to provoke war, while the vast majority of the people love peace. Major Gill, the garrison commander of the American occupation zone of Aldenshtadt, was removed from his post and sent back to the United States for trial because he was friendly with Kuzmin, the garrison commander of the Soviet occupation zone of Aldenshtadt, and inadvertently disrupted the American spies' conspiracy. When he said goodbye to Kuzmin at the Elbe bridgehead, he spoke the words that millions of American soldiers wanted to say: We met as allies, lived as neighbors, and parted as friends, and we hope never to meet again as enemies!

　　《易比河会师》
    “易比河会师”这部电影，表现了德国纳粹被打垮后，易比河东西两岸、阿尔登什塔城苏美两占领区的两个世界。
    在东岸苏联占领区，苏联帮助德国人民肃清纳粹匪徒，毁掉军火工厂，恢复生产，发扬德国人民的民族文化，建立民主和平的新德国。在西岸美国占领区，美国“继承”了希特勒的政策，加紧掠夺、压迫德国人民。从这里，我们看到了社会主义苏联和平、民主的对外政策和帝国主义美国战争、掠夺的对外政策间的强烈对比。这样一个严肃的主题，在这部影片上以生动有趣的形象表现了出来。
    在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营与以美国为首的帝国主义阵营之间，是没有第三条道路的。“易比河会师”用科学家吉特里贺博士的故事说明了这一点。吉特里贺起初是一个恨纳粹也恨苏联的“中间分子”，他拒绝把他发明的“天蓝色水晶体”的特许证给苏联。但是在他亲眼看见了两个占领区德国人民不同的生活后，毅然在两个世界中选择了道路，倒向苏联。这是德国人民的道路，也是全世界人民的道路。
    “易比河会师”又表现了，在帝国主义国家里，妄图挑拨战争的只是华尔街的少数老板和军阀，而广大人民是爱好和平的。阿尔登什塔城美国占领区卫戍司令吉尔少校，因为和阿城苏联占领区卫戍司令库兹明友好，而无意中破坏了美国间谍阴谋活动，便被撤职并送回美国受审。当他在易比河桥头和库兹明道别时，说出了千千万万美国士兵要说的话：我们相见时是盟军，相处是邻居，别离时是朋友，希望永远不要成为敌人而再相见！
