　　Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill and other Factories:
    Cadre Overlap and Excessive Meetings Affect Production and Hygiene
    Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Proposes Improvement Measures
    It is reported by Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 22nd: In some factories in Tianjin, excessive meetings and the fact that production cadres hold multiple positions have greatly hindered production and affected the health and economic life of workers. According to statistics, Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill held a total of 62 meetings of administrative, trade union, Communist Party branch, and Communist Youth League organizations in one month. Tianjin Fittings Factory No. 1 held 28 meetings in ten days, with each Communist Party member spending an average of 2.20 hours per day in meetings. The situation is even more serious for some cadres. A Communist Party branch committee member who also served as the Communist Youth League branch secretary at Tianjin Fittings Factory No. 1 attended 22 meetings in ten days. A standing committee member of the trade union at the private Danhua Match Factory attended five meetings in one day, spending seven and a half hours, of which three and a half hours were during production time. Many meetings were held without attendees being punctual, lacking preparation, and cadres speaking at length, resulting in significant time wastage. The excessive number of meetings has seriously affected production and reduced the income of some workers. Zhu Jianying, a grade-A female worker (and trade union committee member) at the private Yitang Rubber Factory, did not reach half of the standard output of rubber shoes in January. Sun Liming, a grade-B worker at the same factory, saw her monthly output decrease by nearly 10% after becoming a trade union cadre. The lives of many worker cadres have been adversely affected as a result. They often say: "Once you become a cadre, you can no longer be a production model!" As a result, some highly efficient workers are unwilling to become cadres.

    The excessive overlap in cadre positions is also a serious problem. Qi Yusong, the head of the nail department at Tianjin Steel Plant, holds eight positions concurrently. Zhu Shuying, a female worker at the Danhua Match Factory, holds seven positions concurrently. Almost every factory has individuals holding four or five positions. This not only affects production but also harms the health of workers.

    The main reasons for the above phenomena are the serious formalism and bureaucracy in the leadership of public factories, the failure to truly recognize that production is the overriding central task, the failure to deeply understand the demands of the masses, and the inability to systematically cultivate and promote cadres from the continuously emerging production activists. As a result, various tasks can only be placed on the existing few cadres. At the same time, administrative, Communist Party branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations operate mechanically according to their respective organizational systems, failing to understand the importance of unified leadership, avoiding meeting duplication, adequately preparing before meetings, and controlling time during meetings. In January, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed its subordinate Party organizations to streamline meetings and reduce cadre overlap, stipulating that each Party member or Communist Youth League member should not hold more than two positions; and that Communist Party members in the Communist Youth League organization should withdraw from the work of the Communist Youth League, except for those who are necessary. However, to date, most factories have not seriously implemented this. To this end, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued another instruction, ordering Party organizations at all levels to continue to implement the previous decision; and specifically stipulating the number and duration of various Party and Youth League meetings each month. At the same time, it suggested that trade unions not hold more than four meetings per month, each not exceeding one hour. In addition, the instruction also suggested that administrative, trade union, Communist Party branch, and Communist Youth League organizations within factories establish coordination meetings to promptly resolve production and other issues; but each meeting should not exceed fifteen minutes.

### 津市中纺五厂等工厂  干部兼职会议多  影响生产和卫生  中共天津市委提改进办法

　　津市中纺五厂等工厂
    干部兼职会议多  影响生产和卫生
    中共天津市委提改进办法
    【新华社天津二十二日电】天津市部分工厂因会议繁多，生产干部身兼数职，大大妨害了生产并影响职工的健康和经济生活。据统计：天津中纺五厂的行政、工会、共产党支部及青年团的各种会议一月共达六十二次。天津装具一分厂曾在十天内开过二十八次会议，每个共产党员平均每天要花两点二十分钟的时间来开会。就某些干部来说，情形更为严重。天津装具一分厂的共产党支部委员兼青年团支书，十天共开了二十二个会。私营丹华火柴厂工会常委一天开了五个会，用去七个半小时，其中三个半小时是属于生产时间。不少会议召开时，与会者不遵守时间，缺乏准备，干部们讲话又长，因此时间浪费很大。会议的繁多，已严重地影响了生产，并减少了一些职工的收入。私营义堂橡胶厂甲级女工朱剑英（工会委员），一月份所完成的胶鞋达不到标准产量的一半。该厂乙级工人孙丽明自当工会干部后，每月产量即降低了近百分之十。不少的工人干部的生活并因而发生困难。他们常说：当了干部，再无法做生产模范了！为此，有些生产效率很高的工人都不愿意当干部。
    干部兼职过多，也是一个严重问题。天津制钢总厂丝钉部主管齐玉松身兼八职，丹华火柴厂女工朱淑英身兼七职，而一人兼四、五个职务者，则几乎各厂都有。这样不仅影响了生产，而且也损害了职工的健康。
    发生上述现象的主要原因是公营工厂的领导方面存在着严重的形式主义、官僚主义作风，没有真正认识到生产是压倒一切的中心工作，没有深入了解群众的要求，不能有计划地在不断涌现的生产积极分子中培养、提拔干部，结果只能将各种工作压在原有的几个干部身上；同时行政、共产党支部、工会、青年团等又机械地按照各自的组织系统办事，不知道统一领导、避免会议重复、会前充分准备、会上掌握时间的重要性。中共天津市委曾于一月间指示所属各级党的组织精简会议、减少干部兼职，规定每一个党员或青年团员不得担任两种以上职务；青年团组织中的共产党员除必要者外，一律退出青年团的工作等。但迄目前为止，多数工厂仍未认真贯彻执行。为此，中共天津市委最近再次发出指示，责成各级党的组织继续贯彻上次决定；并具体规定每月党和团的各种会议的次数与时间，同时建议工会不要使工会会议每月超过四次，每次不要超过一小时。此外，指示并建议工厂内的行政、工会、共产党支部、青年团等组织相互建立碰头会，以及时解决生产及其他问题；但每次时间不得超过一刻钟。
