Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS Moscow, 1st: The Truth Daily recently published an editorial on the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to once again reduce state retail prices for food and manufactured goods, stating: This epoch-making decision of the Party and Government most vividly reflects the Stalinist concern for the welfare of the working people. The entire activity of the Party of Lenin and Stalin is only selfless service to the people; there is no interest of the Party higher than the interest of the people. This is precisely why our great Party has won the infinite trust and sincere love of the people.

As is well known, since the abolition of the rationing system at the end of 1947, food and consumer goods have been reduced in price three times. As a result of the first price reduction in December 1947, the people saved nearly 86 billion rubles in a year. As a result of the second price reduction in March 1949, the people saved about 71 billion rubles again in a year. As far as the third price reduction in state-owned trade is concerned, the people will save at least 80 billion rubles a year as a result of this price reduction. After the state-owned trade reduces prices, the collective farm market and cooperative trade will then implement almost equal price reductions, and all the people will save at least 11 million rubles a year as a result. Socialism is unimaginable without the daily care of the state for the welfare of the people. This is the immutable law of development of socialist society.

The reason why another price reduction is possible is based on the achievements of our country's industry and agriculture in 1949, and on the increase in labor productivity and the reduction in production costs. In the four years of the post-war five-year plan, not only was the pre-war production level reached, but it was actually exceeded. All sectors of our national economy are advancing confidently. And this means that the welfare of the Soviet people is growing at the same steady pace.

The third price reduction is the largest in the post-war era. All working people will benefit greatly from this price reduction.

Referring to the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers that, starting from March 1, 1950, the exchange rate between the ruble and foreign currencies will no longer be calculated on the basis of the US dollar, but will be changed to a more stable gold standard based on the gold content of the ruble, the Truth Daily said: The currency reform implemented by the Soviet Union in December 1947 eradicated the adverse consequences of World War II on currency circulation and restored the full value of the Soviet ruble. The abolition of the rationing system, which was implemented simultaneously with the currency reform and the substantial reduction in consumer goods prices (implemented three times between 1947 and 1950), has further consolidated the ruble, increased the purchasing power of the ruble, and also increased the exchange rate between the ruble and foreign currencies.

The situation in the capitalist world is completely different. Currencies in Western countries continue to fall and are being devalued. Consumer prices are rising in the United States, inflation continues on this basis, and the purchasing power of the dollar is greatly reduced.

The stark contrast between the two worlds and the two economic systems is revealed with all its strength. In socialist countries, the welfare of the people is gradually improving, and life is becoming more prosperous and more beautiful every year. In capitalist countries, unemployment is increasing, millions of working people are doomed to poverty and hunger, and the living standards of the people are constantly declining.

In order to overcome the growing economic crisis at the expense of the masses of the people, capitalists, for example, the US government does not hesitate to destroy large quantities of food in order to maintain high retail prices to please the monopoly capitalists, while millions of people are suffering from hunger.

Millions of working people in capitalist countries have no work or food, they are homeless, while the profits of monopoly capitalists are expanding mythically.

The Soviet people proudly feel the great superiority of Soviet society, and they understand that thanks to the tireless concern of our father and friend, the great Stalin, for the needs of the working people, our people have achieved epoch-making achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party.

After the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on another price reduction was broadcast yesterday, grand rallies were held by working people in various enterprises, institutions, and collective farms.

Soviet workers expressed their warm gratitude to the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin for their tireless concern for the welfare of the people, and they also expressed their firm determination to respond to this concern with new labor achievements, with further unwavering efforts to increase labor productivity. Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of workers in Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, the Donets Basin, Baku, Riga, and other industrial centers of the Soviet Union undertook further production guarantees.

These heartfelt words express the emotions and thoughts of millions of working people, and express their patriotic desire to further increase their labor productivity for the happiness of our great motherland and for the vital interests of the Soviet people.

The Truth Daily concluded: The Soviet people are more closely united around the Communist Party, around the great Comrade Stalin, to meet the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Voters voting for candidates from the Party and the non-Party alliance is voting for the great Party of Lenin and Stalin, for the prosperity of our socialist motherland, for the further improvement of the material welfare of our people, and for a happier, more beautiful, and more cultured life for the Soviet people.

　　真理报论减低物价决定
    党与政府这一划时代的决定，最生动地反映对劳动人民福利的斯大林式的关怀
    两个世界两个经济制度的鲜明对比，以全部力量显露出来。在社会主义国家，人民生活每一年都能更丰裕与更美满。在资本主义国家，人民生活水平在不断下降。                          
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：真理报顷发表社论，论述苏联部长会议及联共中央委员会关于再度减低食品及制成品国家零售价格的决定称：党与政府这一划时代的决定，最生动地反映了对于劳动人民福利的斯大林式的关怀。列宁、斯大林党的全部活动只是对于人民的忘我服务，党没有什么利益高于人民的利益。这正是我们伟大的党何以赢得了人民的无限信任与赤诚爱戴的理由。
    众所周知，自一九四七年末期废除了配给制以来，食品与消费品已实行了三次减价。由于一九四七年十二月第一次减价的结果，人民在一年当中节省了将近八百六十亿卢布。由于一九四九年三月第二次减价的结果，人民在一年当中又节省了大约七百一十亿卢布。单就国营贸易第三次减价而论，人民在一年当中将因这一减价而至少节省下八百亿卢布。国营贸易减低价格后，集体农场市场及合作社贸易将继而实行几乎相等的减价，全体人民在一年当中将因此至少节省下一千一百万卢布。人民的福利要是没有得到国家的日常关怀，那么社会主义是不可想像的。这便是社会主义社会不变的发展法则。
    再度减低价格之所以成为可能，是以我国工农业一九四九年的成就，是以劳动生产率的增加及生产成本的减低为基础的。在战后五年计划的四年当中，不仅达到了战前生产水平，而且实际上还超过了战前生产水平。我国国民经济一切部门正满怀信心地向前迈进。而这就意味着苏联人民的福利正在同样稳步地增长。
    第三次减价是战后年代中最大的一次。全体劳动人民将从这次减价而获得很大利益。
    论及苏联部长会议关于自一九五○年三月一日起，不再以美元为本位来计算卢布与外币的兑换率，而按卢布所含黄金数量，改用更稳定的金本位这一决定时，真理报称：一九四七年十二月苏联所实行的货币改革，根绝了第二次世界大战在货币流通上的不良后果，并恢复了苏联卢布的全部价值。与货币改革及消费品价格的大大减低（在一九四七——五○年间共实行了三次）同时实行的废除配给制，已使卢布更形巩固，提高了卢布的购买力，也提高了卢布与外币的兑换率。
    资本主义世界的情况则截然不同。西方国家的货币继续跌价且正在贬值。美国的消费品价格在上涨，通货继续在这一基础上膨胀，美元的购买力正在大减。
    两个世界两个经济制度的鲜明的对比，以全部力量显露出来。在社会主义国家，人民的福利在逐步增进，且每一年都使得生活更丰裕与更美满了。在资本主义国家，失业在增加，千百万劳动人民被注定了要遭受贫困与饥饿，而人民的生活水平在不断下降。
    资本家为图以牺牲人民大众来克服日益增长的经济危机，例如，美国政府毫不迟疑地毁坏大量食品，以保持高昂的零售价格来取悦于垄断资本家，而千百万人民却受着饥饿。
    资本主义国家千百万劳动人民既无工作亦无食物，他们无家可归，而垄断资本家的利润却神话般地膨胀着。
    苏联人民骄傲地感觉到苏维埃社会的巨大优越性，他们了解由于我们的父亲和朋友伟大的斯大林对劳动人民需要的不倦关切，我国人民在共产党领导下获得了划时代的成就。
    苏联部长会议及联共中央委员会关于再次减低价格的决定在昨天广播后，各企业各机关和各集体农场的劳动人民都举行了盛大的集会。
    苏联工人表示热烈感激共产党、苏维埃政府和斯大林同志对人民福利的不倦关切，他们还表示他们坚定的决心，即以新的劳动业迹，以进一步坚定不移地提高劳动生产率来回答这种关怀。昨天，莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌拉尔、顿尼兹盆地、巴库、里加和苏联其他工业中心的成千成万工人承担了进一步生产的保证。
    这些出自心坎的言词，表示出千百万劳动人民的情绪和思想，表示出他们对于为了我们伟大祖国的幸福，为了苏联人民的切身利益而进一步增加其劳动生产率的爱国心愿。
    真理报结语写道：苏联人民更加紧密地团结在共产党、团结在伟大的斯大林同志周围，来迎接苏联最高苏维埃选举。选民们投票选举党与非党联盟候选人，就是投票拥护列宁和斯大林的伟大的党，拥护我们社会主义祖国的繁荣，拥护我国人民物质福利的进一步增进，拥护苏联人民的更幸福、更美满与更有文化的生活。
