　　During the People's Liberation War, after our army annihilated the Kuomintang bandit army's 74th Division, it took the initiative to withdraw from Meng Lianggu. In Han Village, at the foot of Meng Lianggu Mountain, which was occupied by the enemy, Han Guixiang, an eighteen-year-old probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party, bravely rescued a seriously wounded political instructor of our army from the battlefield.

　　Under the enemy's extremely strict search and blockade, the entire Han Guixiang family, regardless of any difficulties, persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines under the leadership of their superiors, and healed the instructor and sent him back to the front line.

　　With the support of the Kuomintang bandit army, the local tyrant landlords took the opportunity to return to their hometowns, oppress the people again, and discuss with the bandit army a plan to wipe out our army in one fell swoop. The puppet village chief inadvertently told Guixiang about this plan. Guixiang rushed to our local armed forces overnight to report the emergency. At this time, Han Guixiang was approved as an official member of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and was ordered by her superiors to return to Han Village to rectify the organizational life of the Party. Our army then waited for the opportune moment to prepare to attack the enemy and protect the wheat harvest.

　　Soon after, the enemy learned about Guixiang's sheltering of our army instructor, and arrested Guixiang and her younger brother Bao'er, and shot Guixiang's grandmother. After Guixiang was arrested, she was subjected to brutal torture by the enemy, but she was brave and unyielding, severely rebuking the enemy, making them embarrassed. Just as the enemy was about to kill Guixiang and her brother, our armed forces stormed into the village, annihilated the enemy, and saved their lives.

　　Guixiang demonstrated the noble and great qualities of the Chinese people. This new type of person is constantly emerging in the revolutionary struggle under the education and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　They grow up among the people and are flesh and blood with the people. They are the glory of the Chinese people, they are the glory of the Party.

    在人民解放战争中，我军歼灭了国民党匪军七十四师后，即主动撤离孟良崮。在被敌人占领的孟良崮山脚下的韩家庄，十八岁的中国共产党女候补党员韩桂香奋不顾身地从战场上救回来一个受了重伤的我军政治指导员。
    在敌人极严密的搜查和封锁下，韩桂香一家老小，不顾任何艰难困苦，在上级领导之下，坚持敌后斗争，并且把指导员医好送回前线。
    在国民党匪军支持下，恶霸地主趁机返乡，重新欺压人民，并与匪军商讨一网打尽我军的计划。伪村长无意中把这计划，告诉了桂香。桂香星夜赶往我地方武装部队告急。这时，韩桂香被批准为光荣的中国共产党正式党员，并奉上级命令，返回韩家庄整顿党的组织生活。我军即等待时机成熟，准备出击敌人，保护麦收。
    不久，桂香掩护我军指导员事被敌人知道，敌人便逮捕了桂香及其弟弟保儿，并枪杀了桂香的老祖母。桂香被逮捕后，在敌人严刑拷打下，英勇不屈，痛斥敌人，使敌人狼狈不堪。正在敌人要杀害桂香姐弟之时，我武装部队攻入村中，歼灭了敌人，挽救了她二人的生命。
    桂香表现了中国人民崇高伟大的品质。这种新的人物，在中国共产党的教育和培养下，不断地在革命斗争中涌现出来。
    他们生长在人民中，与人民骨肉相关。他们是中国人民的光荣、他们是党的光荣。
