Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, March 25th: Factories in the Dalian-Lushun area are gradually strengthening their safety equipment and employee welfare. Currently, most of the lathes in the area's factories have been fitted with safety covers, and where possible, the highly dangerous belt-driven lathes are being replaced with electrically driven automatic lathes. The Dalian Guanghe Machinery Factory is now vigorously manufacturing this type of automatic lathe to meet the needs of various factories. Most of the lathes at the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory have been fitted with protective covers, and safety nets have also been installed on the dock bridge panels. Eye-catching signs have been posted throughout the workshops and dangerous areas. The factory stipulates that cranes must not lift components exceeding their weight capacity. All factories have increased protective facilities for workplaces involving high temperatures and chemical irritants. Workers engaged in such production are given health care wages and special work clothes that are higher than those of general workers. The factories' trade unions are also mobilizing workers to widely propose reasonable suggestions for safety equipment. In terms of employee welfare, according to statistics, 55 cooperatives, 72 bathhouses, 49 barber shops, 116 canteens, 10 nurseries, and 54 hospitals and clinics have been opened throughout the area. In the two years since the establishment of the Dalian Workers' Hospital, more than 135,000 employees and their families have received free or reduced-price medical treatment. The Dalian Dock has built a "Red Star Building" for more than 500 single workers. The facilities, including a canteen, library, entertainment room, and cooperative, are relatively complete. The dock has also established a nursing home for elderly workers.

    【新华社大连二十五日电】旅大地区各工厂的安全设备和职工福利工作正逐步加强中。现该区大多数工厂中的车床，都装上了安全盖，并尽可能把危险性很大的皮带牵引的车床改为电滚牵引的自动车床。大连广和机械厂现正大力制造此种自动车床，以供各厂需要。大连修船造船厂车床大部安装了护盖，坞间桥板亦已安设保险网，车间及危险场所遍贴引人注意的标志，该厂规定吊车不得吊载超过重量的机件。各厂对从事高温度及带有化学刺激性的工作场所，都增加了保护设施。从事此种生产的工人，均发给了多于一般工人的保健工资及特种工作服。各厂工会亦同时发动工人广泛提出有关安全设备的合理建议。职工福利工作方面，据统计，全区现已开办了五十五个合作社，七十二个浴池，四十九个理发处，一百十六个食堂，十处托儿所，五十四处医院和医疗所。旅大职工医院成立以来的两年中，得到免费和减价医治疾病的职工及其家属即有十三万五千余人。大连码头为五百多名独身工人修建一座“红星楼”。其中食堂、图书室、娱乐室、合作社等设备均较完善。该码头并为老年工人设立了一所养老院。
