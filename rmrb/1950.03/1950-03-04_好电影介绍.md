    In Human World

    "In Human World" depicts the struggle history of the great Soviet writer Gorky.
    Gorky worked as an apprentice in his childhood and lived a very hard life. Not only did he have to do heavy work in the shop, but he also had to do many trivial things for the master's family, and he was often punished by the master for some small things. Even so, he insisted on reading in his spare time, regardless of the "master's" opposition.
    He once worked as a small servant washing dishes in the kitchen of a ship, and also had the opportunity to read many books. But his time in such a good environment was short-lived, and he was squeezed out by others. He lived a wandering life. He tried his best to help others when they were in trouble. Finally, he became the banner of proletarian revolutionary literature.

    本片是根据苏联文学家奥斯特洛夫斯基的小说改编的。它描写了保尔柯察金一生的生活，和这个同时代的社会变革。苏联十月革命后，国内外反动派勾结在一起，想摧毁年青的苏维埃政权。这时，保尔柯察金为了保卫祖国，争取自由和人类解放，在艰苦的困难下，进行了不屈不挠的斗争，而锻炼成钢铁般的战士。
    这本小说是原作者根据亲身经历而写出的，所以很生动逼真。
