　　Guarantee Workers' Study Time!
　　Our Correspondent Zhou Yaodong
　　Workers from the iron workshop, coking oven, and blast furnace of the Ironmaking Plant at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have set up three literacy classes themselves.
　　The iron workshop literacy class was established in August last year. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 12:00 to 1:00 PM (including lunchtime) is the fixed study time, divided into beginner and intermediate levels. Twenty-nine people participate in the study, accounting for two-thirds of the workers in the entire workshop. The early and middle shift literacy classes at the coking oven were established in September last year, with a total of sixty-five participants, divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, studying for one hour before work each day. These two literacy classes were suspended in November. The blast furnace literacy class at the Ironmaking Plant was organized twice. The first time was from July to August last year, with a total of twenty students. It was suspended due to the factory's "Iron Inspection Movement," where the factory initiated voluntary labor; it was reorganized in September with three classes and a total of one hundred students, starting with literacy, studying for one hour of spare time after each iron tapping, once a day. At the end of the year, production volume increased, time was limited, and it had to be suspended again.
  Self-select teachers, solve the organization leadership and teaching materials, classroom problems yourself.
　　These literacy classes were completely initiated by the workers themselves. After a year of political education since liberation, their awareness has improved, and they are eager to improve their education. One worker in the iron workshop said, "If we don't study culture, we will lag behind in all aspects." When the literacy class was established, the workers solved many problems themselves. Without teachers, they elected "little teachers." For example, the two "little teachers" in the early shift literacy class at the coking oven only had four or five years of education. They and the literacy class leader (also elected by the workers) jointly organized a group to study how to lead the study, solve some problems in teaching, strengthen pre-class preparation, and study together whenever they had time. Therefore, they not only taught well, but also made rapid progress themselves. In terms of the organization and leadership of the literacy class, the workers went through group discussions and elected a class leader, group leader, and study secretary to lead the study. Attendance is taken before each class, leave must be requested for absences, and exams are held every ten lessons. In addition, there are also regular self-criticism meetings to review problems in learning. Party and League members also played a certain role in learning, taking the lead actively and ensuring learning with their exemplary actions. Sometimes the trade union also provided guidance and assistance.
  Seize learning anytime, anywhere. Significant achievements in two months
　　The classrooms for the literacy classes were sometimes borrowed from the on-site offices and the union’s rooms; some were in the machine room, using a small blackboard from a display board. They sat on small stools, bricks, and wooden blocks, and gathered together to take classes. The curriculum was Mandarin, using the Workers' Literacy Textbook published by the Workers' Daily. Some classes also included arithmetic. Because the teachers in the literacy class are also workers, they can connect the literacy teaching with the actual lives of the workers, so that the workers can experience it more deeply and remember it more firmly from their own lives. Workers have poor memory, so they emphasize more practice. They often hold teaching method research meetings. Because they are all workers, there are no worries about expressing opinions, and they say whatever they have to say, so that the teachers can lecture based on everyone's opinions. The workers have a very high enthusiasm for learning. The trade union supplied them with some waste paper and chalk, and each of them ordered a small notebook and carried a piece of chalk in their pocket. Students and teachers work together, and practice writing whenever they have time; if they don't know, they ask. Students also frequently ask each other questions, encouraging everyone's learning enthusiasm. Comrade Gao Mantang, a worker at the coking plant, is already forty-one years old, and has never been absent from learning. He practices writing with chalk whenever he has time, and can also help others. In learning, the workers showed the loving spirit of unity and mutual assistance.
　　The entire learning time was only two or three months, but their learning achievements were great. In the iron workshop literacy class, in two months and twenty hours of study, the workers who were originally illiterate can now recognize up to two hundred characters and at least one hundred characters, and can also write them down; they have learned addition and subtraction in arithmetic. In the coking oven literacy class, in three months and twenty-five hours, the illiterate workers completed the first volume of the Workers' Literacy Textbook, and the intermediate class can write simple short articles. In the last test of the blast furnace literacy class, 53 people participated in the exam, 37 scored above 90, 5 scored above 80, 8 scored above 60, and only 7 failed. Most of the students can write simple receipts. Because they recognize some characters, their enthusiasm for learning is even better. One worker said, "In the past, I simply ignored some notices and announcements on the blackboard newspaper, because I was blind and it was useless to look. After recognizing a few characters, I paid special attention to looking at them, and wrote down the unfamiliar characters and asked others. Not only can I make progress, but I also understand some things."
  Reasons for Literacy Class Stoppage Obligatory Overtime Too Many Meetings Learning Time Not Guaranteed
　　Why did the three literacy classes collapse after a period of persistence? Mainly because the pace of production and learning was not consistent, and the time was not well divided and coordinated. When the Iron Inspection Movement came, there was obligatory overtime, and there was no time to study, so it had to be interrupted. When the Ironmaking Plant increased production to 330 tons, the workers' labor intensity reached its peak, and they were so tired after work that they couldn't even straighten their backs. In addition, there were too many meetings. The iron workshop held more than six meetings every week, each lasting at least two hours and up to four hours, plus eight hours of production, it was difficult to continue learning. The trade union also did not provide good specific leadership, and reasonable guarantees were not given for learning time. The workers' most urgent request is that a certain guarantee can be given for learning time.
　　Currently, the above problems have attracted the attention of the factory's Party, government, trade union, and League organizations, and they are studying to guarantee workers a certain amount of study time and have organized a workers' spare-time refresher school, which will start classes soon.

### 保证工人的学习时间！

　　保证工人的学习时间！
    本报通讯员  周耀东
    石景山钢铁厂机修场的铁工房、炼焦炉、炼铁厂高炉三处工人，自己办了三个识字班。
    铁工房识字班于去年八月成立。每星期一、三、五中午十二时至一时（午饭时间在内）为固定学习时间，分初、中两级学习。参加学习的二十九人，占全房工人三分之二。炼焦炉早、中两班识字班于去年九月成立，共有六十五人参加，分初、中、高三级，在每日上班前学习一小时。这两处识字班均于十一月停顿。炼铁厂高炉识字班曾前后组织了两次。第一次是去年七月至八月，共有学员二十人，中间因厂中搞“检铁运动”，厂方发动了义务劳动，即自行停顿；九月间又重新组织起三个班，共有学员一百人，从识字开始学习，学习是在每日出铁后的一小时空余时间，一天上课一次，年底生产量增加，时间有限，又只得停顿。
  自选教师，自己解决组织领导和教材、教室问题。
    这几个识字班完全是工友自发搞起来的。他们经过解放后一年来的政治教育，觉悟提高了，迫切要求提高文化。铁工房一个工友讲：“再不学习文化，各方面都要落后了”。识字班成立时，工友们自己想办法解决了许多问题。没有教员，他们就选举了小先生。如炼焦炉早班识字班的两名小先生，只有四、五年文化程度。他们和识字班的班长（也是工人选出的）共同组织了一个小组，研究如何领导学习，解决教学中一些问题，加强课前准备，随时随地有空就在一起研究。因此，他们不仅教得很好，本人进步也很快。在识字班的组织领导方面，工友们经过了小组讨论，选出了班长、小组长和学习干事来领导学习。每次上课以前点名，有事要请假，每讲十课就举行考试。除此以外还有定期的检讨会，检讨学习中的问题。党、团员在学习中也起了一定的作用，积极带头，以自己的模范行动来保证学习。有时候工会也给予指导和帮助。
  随时随地抓紧学习两月时间成绩显著
    识字班的教室，有的是借用现场的办公室和分工会的房子；有的在机器房里，借用揭示牌一块很小的黑板。他们坐在小板凳上、砖头木块上、围在一起就上课了。学习课程是国语，用工人日报出版的工人识字课本。有的班附带学习算术。识字班的教师，因为自己也是工人，能联系工友的实际生活来教识字，使工人从切身生活中体会得更深刻，记的更踏实。工人记忆力较差，他们就强调多练习。他们经常开教学方法研究会，因为都是工友，提意见一点也没有顾虑，有什么说什么，使教师根据大家的意见来讲课。工友们的学习情绪很高。工会供给了他们一部废纸和粉笔，他们每个人都订了一个小本子，口袋里装着一根粉笔。学生和老师同在一起干活，有空就练习写；不会就问。学员和学员也是经常提问题，鼓励着大家的学习情绪。炼焦厂的高满堂工友，已经四十一岁了，在学习中从来也没有缺过席，有空就用粉笔练习写，还能帮助别人。在学习上，工友们表现了团结互助的友爱精神。
    整个学习时间只是两三个月的光景，他们的学习成绩却很大。铁工房识字班在两个月二十小时的学习中，原来不识字的工友现在最多的能识二百个字，最少的一百字以上，还都会写下来；算术学会了加减法，炼焦炉识字班在三个月二十五小时中，不识字的工友学完了工人识字课本第一册，中级班会写简单的小文章。高炉的识字班最后的一次测验，有五十三人参加了考试，有三十七人是九十分以上，五个人是八十分以上，八个人是六十分以上，只有七个人不及格。大部分学员会写简单的收条了。正因为他们识了一些字，学习情绪就更好了，一个工友说：“过去黑板报的一些通知和布告，我就干脆不理，因为我是睁眼瞎，看也是白搭工。识了几个字以后，我就要特别的注意要看看，不认识的字就记下来，再去问别人。不单能够进步，也明白了一些事情。”
  识字班停顿原因  义务加班  开会太多  学习时间  没有保证
    三个识字班为什么坚持了一个时期后又垮台了呢？主要由于生产同学习步调没有一致，时间没有很好的划分开和相互配合起来。检铁运动来了就搞义务加班，没有学习时间，只得中断。炼铁厂在增产量到三百三十吨时，工人劳动强度已到了顶点，下班以后累得连腰也直不起来。再加以会议太多，铁工房每星期开过六次会，每次最少二小时，最多四小时，加上八小时生产，就很难学习下去。工会也没有很好的给予具体领导，学习时间没有给予合理的保证。工人最迫切的要求，就是在学习时间上能有一定的保证。
    目前，上述问题已引起该厂党、政、工、团方面的注意，正研究保证工人一定的学习时间，并组织了工人业余补习学校，不久即可上课。
