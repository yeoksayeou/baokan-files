Xinhua News Agency, Sverdlovsk, 3rd: On March 1st, the district election meeting was held at the Lunacharsky State Opera House here. Voters met their candidate for representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Shvernik.

    A total of 1,500 representatives of the working people and various public organizations from the 17th constituency of the Nationalities Council of the Supreme Soviet of Sverdlovsk attended the meeting. The theater hall, decorated for the festival, was packed.

    Amidst great enthusiasm, the participants of the meeting elected the Politburo of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), headed by Stalin, as the honorary presidium of the meeting.

    Korunov, the electoral supervisor of the 55th sub-constituency, declared on the podium: The Soviet people, with great joy, nominated Comrade Stalin, the wise leader and mentor of the working people, as the first candidate of all the people. (A storm of long-lasting applause) Our people have unanimously nominated Comrade Stalin’s loyal comrades-in-arms as candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik, the great Stalin's faithful student and comrade-in-arms, has agreed to be a candidate for representative of the 17th constituency of Sverdlovsk to the Soviet of Nationalities. (Loud applause)

    The speaker described Comrade Shvernik as an outstanding leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, who dedicated all his energy to striving for the happiness of the working people.

    Professor Pushkareva, Doctor of Chemistry, then spoke on behalf of the scientists of Sverdlovsk.

    She said: The students and scientists of the Ural Kirov Institute of Technology have unanimously nominated Comrade Shvernik, the loyal comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin, as their candidate for representative of the 17th constituency of Sverdlovsk to the Soviet of Nationalities. From Comrade Shvernik, we see a brilliant example of selfless service to our motherland. On behalf of the scientists of this city, I extend my sincere greetings to Comrade Shvernik and thank him for agreeing to serve as a candidate for representative of the 17th constituency of Sverdlovsk. We will unanimously vote for him on election day. Voting for Comrade Shvernik means voting to support our beloved Bolshevik Party, the great leader and mentor of the Soviet people, Comrade Stalin, and to support the new upsurge of our socialist motherland.

    The electoral supervisors of the various sub-constituencies spoke one after another, calling on voters to unanimously vote on election day for the candidates of the inviolable Stalinist alliance of party members and non-party members.

    As the meeting drew to a close, Shvernik, candidate for representative to the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech amidst the enthusiastic welcome of the audience.

    Shvernik’s speech was as follows:

    Comrades! Let me express my deep gratitude to you and to all the voters of the Sverdlovsk constituency for nominating me as a candidate for representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the highest organ of power of the Soviet socialist state. (Applause)

    Your trust in me is first and foremost a trust in the party of Lenin and Stalin, a trust in its unshakable prestige won in the heroic struggle to establish a government of workers and peasants, in the struggle for the freedom and happiness of the working people, and in the struggle for the victory of socialism in our country. (Applause)

    This trust places a great responsibility on me in my activities, towards the workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and towards the Communist Party.

    As for myself, I wish to assure you that I will strive to earnestly practice the trust that the voters have placed in me. In all my work, I will act according to the instructions of our wise leader and mentor, the loyal comrade-in-arms of Lenin and the successor to his cause, Comrade Stalin. (Applause)

    To fulfill the lofty task of a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics without shame in action is a great fortune for every Soviet citizen.

    In the last election, our Bolshevik Party called upon voters to vote for candidates of the alliance of Communists and non-Party members. This call of the Party received a heartfelt and unanimous response from millions of Soviet people, who voted for the candidates of the Stalinist alliance. The Soviet People place unlimited trust in the Communist Party, because many years of experience have convinced them of: the accuracy and consistency of the Lenin-Stalin policy, which is in line with the most vital interests of the workers, peasants and intellectuals, because the entire immeasurable activity of our Party is a selfless service to the people. (Applause)

    The elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are an extremely moving demonstration of the moral and political unity of our people, the boundless power and strength of the Soviet socialist state.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the working class and the peasantry completed the Great October Socialist Revolution (which was completed with the victory of the Soviet regime), restored the productive forces shattered by the imperialists and the civil war, realized the industrialization of the country, and on this basis united the small farmers into collective farms, guaranteeing our country's socialist victory. (Applause)

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people defended the freedom, honor, and independence of the country in the Great Patriotic War against the German fascists and Japanese imperialist aggressors.

    In this victorious war, the Soviet Union demonstrated the great vitality of the Soviet system and the moral and political unity of the people educated by the Bolshevik Party, headed by Comrade Stalin. (Applause)

  National Economy in All Sectors Has Been Developed on a Large Scale

    In the four years since the last elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, all sectors of our national economy have been developed on a large scale, thus strengthening the Soviet state and its international prestige in solving all the problems facing the world.

    During this period, the Soviet people worked enthusiastically to complete the Stalinist post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule, to restore our destroyed areas, and to further develop heavy industry and railway transportation (this is the supreme task), to restore the pre-war level of industry and agriculture, in order to greatly exceed this level. (Applause)

    The Party and the government mobilized all the forces of our people to revitalize the regions that had been damaged in the war against the German fascist aggressors. The serious consequences of the war have been eliminated in the first year of the Stalinist five-year plan.

    In the post-war years, the Soviet people have achieved remarkable victories in all aspects of economic and cultural construction.

    The expanded 1949 state plan has been exceeded by three percent as a whole. As a result, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union increased by 20 percent compared to 1948, and by 41 percent compared to the pre-war 1940. (Applause)

    The production of milled iron equaled 119 percent of 1948. In the fourth quarter of 1949, the production levels stipulated in the last year plan of the Stalinist five-year plan have been exceeded in rolled metal, coal and petroleum production, and other key industrial products. (Applause)

    The 1949 state plan for supplying the national economy has been completed, which has greatly improved the supply of raw materials, fuel, electricity, and equipment to various economic sectors.

    With the completion of the post-war five-year plan, factories, manufacturing plants, and housing construction have also increased. Within the fourth year of the post-war five-year plan, 5,200 large-scale state-owned industrial enterprises have been restored, reconstructed, and put into operation. (Applause) More than 72 million square meters of living space have been built or repaired, and in rural residential areas, 2.3 million houses have been built or repaired. (Applause) In order to meet all our needs, we must further increase industrial production levels. Under the leadership of the Lenin and Stalin party, the Soviet people will complete the prosperity of socialist industry in a short period of time, and thereby improve all aspects of the economic and cultural life of Soviet society. (Applause)

  Socialist Agriculture Has Made Great Achievements

    In the post-war period, socialist agriculture has made great achievements. Collective farms and Soviet farms have expanded the cultivated area, improved the cultivation of fields and the care of crops, and improved the level of agricultural technology.

    In 1949 alone, machine and tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms obtained two to three times more tractors, trucks, and agricultural machinery than in the pre-war 1940. (Applause)

    Thanks to the selfless efforts of collective farmers, and many undertakings completed by the party and the government -- technically arming agriculture, and implementing various agricultural measures based on scientific achievements, our country's grain problem has been completely resolved. The total harvest of grain in 1949 reached 7.6 billion poods. (Applause)

    The increase in grain harvests has enabled our collective farms and state farms to eliminate backwardness in animal husbandry. The decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on the three-year plan for the development of public collective farm state farm high-yielding livestock breeding played a decisive role in this regard.

    The working people of socialist agriculture are victoriously implementing the decisions of the party and the government.

    In 1949, collective farms increased the number of public livestock, greatly exceeding the pre-war 1940 levels, and improved the quality of purebred livestock. (Applause)

    Collective farmers and agricultural experts are fighting with great enthusiasm to realize Stalin's plan to transform nature. By 1950, the afforested area already completed reached 590,000 hectares, and vast areas are ready for future afforestation. In agriculture, pasture and crop rotation systems are being adopted victoriously, and ponds and reservoirs are being built. All of this provides collective farms and state farms with favorable conditions for obtaining stable harvests and guarantees the unprecedented prosperity of socialist agriculture.

    In the development of the creative initiatives of the broad masses, the working people of socialist agriculture must more resolutely fight to consolidate collective farms and state farms, to produce richer products for the consumption of our people, and to guarantee the agricultural raw materials needed by our industry.

    Soviet science has made great progress in the post-war years. It has contributed to the country with rich new discoveries and inventions of great importance in improving the technical and economic levels of Soviet productive forces.

    In contrast to capitalist countries, our science and technology serve the interests of the people, not the interests of a few capitalists, who use scientific discoveries and inventions to intensify the oppression of the working people for their own exploitative purposes.

  The Party and Government Constantly Improve the People's Living and Cultural Standards

    In our country, the steady development of industrial and agricultural production enables the party and the government to constantly improve the people's living and cultural standards. The Soviet state's daily concern for improving the living and cultural standards of workers, peasants, and intellectuals is a law of socialist society's development.

    This year, the party and government implemented a new, third reduction in state retail prices for food and manufactured goods.

    As a result of the price reductions, the people of our country will save at least 110 billion rubles each year. The reduction in prices for food and manufactured goods has once again increased the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble, increased the real wages of workers and staff, and also increased the income of farmers. Due to the price reductions, the expenses for purchasing manufactured goods have been reduced, while the state's purchase price for agricultural products remains unchanged.

    The Soviet Union's achievements are due to the selfless efforts of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, who have achieved new victories in improving industrial and agricultural production, increasing labor productivity, and reducing costs, and also due to the Communist Party's constant and tireless concern for the Soviet people under the direction of Comrade Stalin, the creator of happiness for all nationalities. (Applause)

    Comrade Stalin's name is inseparable from our entire lives, and from the construction, consolidation, and development of the Soviet socialist state, the elimination of exploitation of man by man, the elimination of unemployment, poverty, and destruction. Whereas unemployment, poverty, and destruction are inescapable, constant companions of the capitalist economic system.

  Great Prospects for Communist Construction Unfold Before Us

    The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has unfolded great prospects for communist construction before the working people of our country.

    On February 9, 1946, at the election meeting of the Stalin constituency in Moscow, Comrade Stalin, when talking about long-term plans, said: "...Regarding long-term plans, our party intends to organize another strong upsurge in our national economy, which will enable us to increase our industrial level to, for example, three times that of pre-war industry. We must pay attention to ensuring that our industry can produce 50 million tons of milled iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil each year."

    Inspired by their achievements, the Soviet people are selflessly fighting to further develop their national economy, science, technology, and art. Soviet patriotism is an inexhaustible source of strength for our people, which is manifested in the large-scale socialist competition that has become widespread throughout the country, and in the methods of organized labor of communism in socialist society.

    Our country's creative initiatives and the labor enthusiasm of the masses are generating new advanced and efficient working methods, which are universal to all sectors of the economy and culture. The government and the party extensively encourage workers, peasants, and experts, because of their achievements and successes in work, they are given the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and awarded orders and medals. In some industries, a bonus system has been adopted as an encouragement for long service and flawless work.

    The peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are bravely following the Bolshevik Party -- which is leading the Soviet people to fight for the implementation of the great Stalinist plan to guarantee the development of our country's productive forces, the further improvement of our people's welfare, and the unprecedented promotion of socialist culture.

    The Soviet people are enthusiastically fighting to implement these plans, which specifically embody the teachings of our leader, mentor, and friend, Comrade Stalin. (Applause)

    Our country's achievements are undeniable. But we should not be complacent. As is well known, complacency often leads to arrogance and self-satisfaction, which can hinder our further progress.

  Use Criticism and Self-Criticism to Resolutely Struggle Against Shortcomings

    The Soviet people must constantly increase their achievements in developing industry and agriculture, increasing labor productivity, and striving to reduce production costs, and must resolutely struggle against shortcomings in work, using the methods of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism.

    In mobilizing the Soviet people to complete the tasks facing our country, the Bolshevik Party is always successful, because it always uses the time-tested and infallible method of self-criticism in its work.

    The genius of the great Stalin has transformed our country -- formerly backward in technology and economy -- into the most advanced industrial country in the world, and has led it onto the broad road of communist construction.

    With their historic victory in the Great Patriotic War against Fascist Germany and Imperialist Japan, the Soviet people liberated the people of Europe from the shackles of fascism and encouraged them to rise up and fight against their enslavers.

    The liberated peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania have overthrown the bourgeois landlord regimes in their countries and have firmly embarked on the road of socialism.

  The Revolutionary Victory of the Chinese People Has Strengthened the People's Democratic Front

    The victory of the people's revolution won by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of China under the leadership of the Communist Party and the establishment of the German Democratic Republic have strengthened the strength of the people's democratic front.

    The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries are cooperating and assisting each other closely in the struggle for the peace, security, and independence of all nationalities. (Applause)

    The conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as the agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, and on loans to the People's Republic of China -- all of which are based on respect for national sovereignty -- constitute a historically significant contribution to the consolidation of the democratic cause.

    Today, there is no force in the world that can pull the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries that have embarked on the road of socialism back to capitalism. (Applause)

    We live in the Stalinist era of struggle for communism, in which the socialist front led by the Soviet Union represents an unconquerable force opposed to the capitalist camp.

    In the Soviet Union, industrial and agricultural production is increasing day by day, people's welfare is increasing, and people's purchasing power is increasing.

    In view of the decline in the purchasing power of the US dollar, the US dollar is no longer a stable benchmark for calculation, and therefore the gold standard is used as the benchmark for the official exchange rate of the Soviet ruble, which provides proof of the increase in our country's national strength.

  The Soviet Ruble Is the Most Stable Currency in the World

    The purchasing power of the ruble is higher than its official exchange rate. Therefore, from today onwards, the Soviet government has no longer used the US dollar as the benchmark to stipulate the exchange rate between the ruble and foreign currencies. Instead, it has used the more stable gold as the benchmark for calculating our country's ruble. (Long applause)

    The Soviet ruble will be the most solid and stable currency in the world, because it is guaranteed by the further development of the Soviet national economy. (Applause)

    In capitalist countries, a devastating economic crisis -- and all the steps taken by the imperialists to escape the crisis have proven powerless in its face -- is inevitably coming.

    The Marshall Plan, designed to weaken the impact of the economic crisis, has also proven to be ineffective. In the Marshallized countries, the living standards of the working class are gradually decreasing, unemployment is increasing, and the working masses are becoming absolutely and relatively impoverished. Even according to extremely incomplete materials, there are now more than 40 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in capitalist countries.

  Expose All the Warmongers Without Exception

    In order to weaken the destructive impact of the imminent crisis, the Anglo-American imperialists are attempting to launch a new imperialist war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    The Soviet Union, which has said "peace for the whole world" since its founding, is pursuing a consistent Lenin-Stalin policy of peace with all countries: a policy of exposing all the warmongers without exception.

    This Stalinist policy for the peace and security of all nationalities is winning the sympathy of the working people of all capitalist countries for socialism, because this policy is in line with the most vital interests of all progressive mankind.

    The people's struggle for peace and cooperation between nations will surely achieve comprehensive success, because this progressive movement is led by the Soviet Socialist Republics Union, inspired by the great Stalin. (Applause)

    The Soviet people are greeting the election day of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union with new production victories and new welfare obtained due to the increase in the country's and the people's wealth.

    The Soviet people, convinced of the correctness of the Leninist-Stalinist policy pursued by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), are selflessly loyal to Comrade Stalin, and are moving forward with confidence, pointing out the road to a bright future to the working people of all countries. (Applause)

    In its letter to all voters (including male and female workers, male and female farmers, members of the Soviet Army and Navy, and Soviet intellectuals), the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls on the Soviet people to vote for the candidates of the Stalinist alliance of party members and non-party members.

    In a few days, the Soviet people will vote for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics Union.

    I am confident that the people of the Urals will elect the candidates of the Stalinist alliance who can truly fight for the victory of communism in our country. (Stormy and long applause)

    As a member of the great Lenin and Stalin party, I will do my best to fight for the consolidation of the Soviet socialist state, and for our country's communist victory. (Applause)

    Long live the great Soviet people! (Applause)

    Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) – the organizer of communist victory! (Applause)

    Long live the Soviet Socialist Republics Union!

    For the happiness and joy of the Soviet people and all progressive mankind, long live our wise leader, mentor, and friend, the great Stalin! (Stormy, long applause. All stand. The band plays the Soviet national anthem)

    The participants passed a telegram to all candidates for the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in the 17th constituency of Sverdlovsk.

    The participants passed a telegram to Comrade Stalin with great enthusiasm.

　　斯维德洛夫斯克选区选民大会上
    什维尔尼克发表演说
    按照英明的领袖斯大林的指示行事，保证努力实践选民们的信托。

    同志们！让我向你们和斯维德洛夫斯克选区提名我为苏维埃社会主义国家最高权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的全体选民们表示深深的感谢。（鼓掌）
    你们对我的信托，首先就是对列宁和斯大林党的信托，对它在建立工农政权的英勇斗争中、在争取劳动人民的自由和幸福与争取我国社会主义胜利的斗争中所赢得的不可动摇的威信的信托。（鼓掌）
    这种信托使我在我的活动上，对工人、农民和知识分子，对共产党负有重大的责任。
    至于我自己，我愿向你们保证我将努力实践躬行选民们对我的信托。在我的全部工作中，我将按照我们英明的领袖和导师、列宁的忠诚战友及他的事业的继承者斯大林同志的指示行事。（鼓掌）
    在行动上毫无愧色地履行苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃代表的崇高任务，对于每一个苏联公民是一种很大的幸运。
    我们的布尔什维克党在上次选举中，曾号召选民们投票选举共产党与非党联盟候选人。党的这一号召得到了千百万苏联人民衷心一致的响应，他们投票选举了斯大林联盟候选人。苏联人民对共产党付以无限的信任，因为许多年的经验，已使他们信服：符合于工人、农民和知识分子最切身之利益的列宁——斯大林政策的正确性和一贯性，因为我党的全部无可衡量的活动就是对人民的一种忘我的服务。（鼓掌）
    苏联最高苏维埃的选举，是我国人民道德上和政治上的团结，苏维埃社会主义国家的无穷无尽的力量与实力的极其动人的示威。
    在共产党（布尔什维克）的领导下，工人阶级和农民完成了伟大的十月社会主义革命（它以苏维埃政权的胜利而臻于完成），恢复了为帝国主义者及内战所瓦解的生产力，实现了国家的工业化，并在此基础上把小农团结到集体农场中，保证了我国社会主义的胜利。（鼓掌）
    在共产党的领导下，苏联人民在对德国法西斯与日本帝国主义侵略者的伟大爱国战争中，保卫了国家的自由、荣誉和独立。
    在这一胜利的战争中，苏联显示了苏维埃制度的伟大生命力，和以斯大林同志为首的布尔什维克党所教育的人民在道德上与政治上的团结。（鼓掌）
  国民经济一切部门已大规模发展起来
    自上次苏联最高苏维埃选举以来的四年当中，在共产党的领导下，我国国民经济的一切部门已大规模地发展起来，因而加强了苏维埃国家及其在解决世界各国所面对的一切问题时的国际声誉。
    在这一时期，苏联人民曾热情地工作，以争取先期完成斯大林战后五年计划，恢复我国被破坏的地区，进一步发展重工业和铁路运输业（这是至高无上的任务），恢复工业和农业的战前水平，以便大大地超过这一水平。（鼓掌）
    党与政府为复兴在对德国法西斯侵略者的战争中受到损害的地区，动员了我国人民的一切力量。战争的严重恶果已在斯大林五年计划的第一年中消除了。
    在战后的年月中，苏联人民在经济和文化建设各方面都获得了显赫的胜利。
    扩大了的一九四九年国家计划已整个地被超过百分之三，结果，苏联全部工业总产量较一九四八年增加百分之二十，较战前一九四○年增加百分之四十一。（鼓掌）
    铣铁生产等于一九四八年的百分之一百一十九。在一九四九年第四季，斯大林五年计划最后一年计划所规定的生产水平，在辗金属、煤与石油生产及其他首要工业品方面已被超过。（鼓掌）
    一九四九年供应国民经济的国家计划业已完成，这使得经济各部门的原料、燃料、电力及装备的供应得以大大改善。
    随着战后五年计划的完成，工厂、制造厂与房屋建筑也增加了。在战后五年计划第四年内，已有五千二百座大规模的国有工业企业修复、重建和开工。（鼓掌）已经建筑或修复了七千二百万余方公尺的居住面积，并且在农村居民区，建筑或修复了二百三十万幢房屋。（鼓掌）为了满足我们的一切需要，我们必须更提高工业生产水平。在列宁、斯大林党的领导下，苏维埃人民将在短时期内完成社会主义工业的繁荣，并从而提高苏维埃社会的经济与文化生活的各方面。（鼓掌）
  社会主义农业获极大成就
    在战后时期，社会主义农业已获得极大的成就。集体农场与苏维埃农场业已扩大了耕作的面积，改进了田地的耕种与作物的照料，并提高了农业技术的水平。
    仅仅一九四九年，机器与拖拉机站，集体农场与国家农场就获得了较战前一九四○年多两倍到三倍的拖拉机、载货汽车和农业机器。（鼓掌）
    由于集体农民忘我的努力，和党与政府所完成的许多事业，——在技术上武装农业，并实施了依据科学成就的各种农业措施，我国的谷物问题业已完全解决。一九四九年谷物的总收获量已达七十六亿普特。（鼓掌）
    谷物收获量的提高又使我们的集体农场与国家农场得以消灭养畜业方面的落后现象。苏联部长会议和苏联共产党（布）中央委员会关于发展公有的集体农场国家农场多产牲畜饲养业三年计划的决定，在这方面起了决定作用。
    社会主义农业的劳动人民，正在胜利地执行党与政府的决定。
    一九四九年，集体农场增加了公有牲畜头数，并大大地超过战前一九四○年水平，和改进了纯种牲畜的品质。（鼓掌）
    集体农民与农业专家正在以巨大的热情为实现改造自然的斯大林计划而斗争。到一九五○年，业已完成的造林面积已达五十九万公顷，并有广大地区准备就绪，以便将来造林。在农业方面，正在胜利地采用牧草与作物轮种制，并正在建筑池塘与蓄水池。所有这一切，给集体农场与国家农场提供了获得稳定丰收的有利条件，并保证社会主义农业的空前繁荣。
    在发展广大群众的创造性创议当中，社会主义农业的劳动人民必须更坚决地为巩固集体农场与国家农场、为我国人民的消费而生产更丰富的产品，并为保证我国工业所需要的农业原料而斗争。
    苏维埃科学在战后数年来已有了极大进步。它以丰富的，在提高苏维埃生产力的技术与经济水平方面具有巨大重要性的新发现与发明，贡献给国家。
    和资本主义国家相反，我们的科学与技术是为人民的利益服务，而不是为少数资本家服务的，资本家为了他们自己的剥削目的，而利用科学上的发现与发明，以加紧压迫劳动人民。
    党与政府经常改善人民的生活与文化水平
    在我国，工业与农业生产的稳步发展，使得党与政府能够经常改善人民的生活与文化水平。苏维埃国家对提高工人、农民与知识分子的生活与文化水平的日常的关心，乃是社会主义社会发展的规律。
    今年，党与政府实行了新的第三次减低食品与制成品的国定零售价格。
    由于减价的结果，我国人民每年将至少节省一千一百亿卢布。食品与制成品的减价，再次提高了苏维埃卢布的购买力，增加了工人与职员的实际工资，也增加了农民的收入。由于减低了价格，购买制成品的开支是减少了，而国家收买农产品的价格却不变。
    苏联之所以获得这一切成就，是由于工人、农民与知识分子忘我努力的结果，他们在提高工业与农业生产，提高劳动生产率和减低成本等方面获得了新的胜利，而且也是由于共产党在各族人民幸福的创造者斯大林同志指示之下对苏维埃人民的经常不衰地关心的结果。（鼓掌）
    斯大林同志的名字是和我们全部生活分不开的，和苏维埃社会主义国家的建设、巩固与发展，消灭人对人的剥削，消灭失业、贫困与毁灭是分不开的。而失业、贫困与毁灭却是资本主义经济制度的躲避不开的、经常的伙伴。
    在苏联，社会主义社会生活的各方面正在迅速地发展，而在资本主义国家，阶级矛盾正愈来愈尖锐，生产与贸易额正在下降，失业在增加，数以百万计的劳动人民陷于贫困与饥饿。
    伟大的共产主义建设远景展开在面前
    社会主义在苏联的胜利，在我国劳动人民面前展开了共产主义建设的伟大远景。
    一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科斯大林选区的选举会议上，斯大林同志在谈到长期计划时说：“……关于长期计划，我们党拟组织我国国民经济的又一次强有力的高涨，这将使我们能够提高我们的工业水平，譬如说到战前工业的三倍。我们必须注意使我们的工业每年能够生产五千万吨的铣铁、六千万吨的钢、五亿吨的煤和六千万吨的石油”。
    为自己的成就所鼓舞的苏维埃人民正在忘我地为进一步发展他们的国民经济、科学、技术与艺术而斗争。苏维埃的爱国主义乃是给与我国人民以力量的无穷无尽的源泉，这爱国主义表现在已经普遍全国的广大规模的社会主义竞赛，和社会主义社会中共产主义的组织劳动的方法上。
    我国的创造性的创议和群众的劳动热潮，产生着新的先进的高效率的工作方法，这个普遍于经济与文化的一切部门。政府和党广泛鼓励工人、农民与专家们，因为在工作中的成就与成功，他们得到了社会主义劳动英雄的称号，并且被授予了勋章和奖章。在若干工业中，采用了奖金制度，做为对长时服务和无瑕疵的工作之鼓励。
    苏联各族人民正勇敢地追随着布尔什维克党——它正领导着苏联人民为保证我国生产力的发展，我国人民福利进一步增进和社会主义文化空前发扬的伟大斯大林计划之实现而斗争。
    苏联人民正热情地为执行这些具体表现出我们的领袖、导师和朋友斯大林同志之教训的计划而斗争着。（掌声）
    我国的成就是不容置辩的。但是我们不应引以自满。众所周知，自满往往产生出自负和沾沾自喜，而这些是会妨碍我们进一步前进的。
  利用批评与自我批评向缺点进行坚决斗争
    苏联人民必须在发展工业与农业、提高劳动生产率和努力减低生产成本上不断地增加他们的成就，并且必须和工作中的缺点进行坚决的斗争，这里要利用布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的方法。
    在动员苏联人民完成我国所面临的任务上，布尔什维克党永远是成功的，因为它在工作中总是采用久经考验百试不爽的自我批评的方法。
    伟大斯大林的天才已经把我国——以前在技术与经济上是落后的——变成了世界上最前进的工业国，并且已经把它领上共产主义建设的康庄大道。
    苏联人民以他们在对法西斯德国和帝国主义日本所进行的伟大爱国战争中所获得的历史性胜利，从法西斯的羁绊下解放了欧洲人民，并且鼓励他们起而和他们的奴役者进行斗争。
    解放了的波、捷、匈、罗、保、阿尔巴尼亚诸国人民，已经推翻了他们国内的资产阶级地主政权，并且已经稳固地踏上社会主义的大道。
  中国人民的革命胜利加强了人民民主阵线
    中国的工人、农民和知识分子在共产党领导下所赢得的人民革命的胜利和德意志民主共和国的成立，加强了人民民主阵线的力量。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家为争取各族人民的和平、安全与独立，它们彼此正亲密地合作与互助着。（掌声）
    苏联与中华人民共和国的友好同盟互助条约以及关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定和关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定之缔结——这些全是基于尊重民族主权而缔结的——构成了对巩固民主事业有历史意义的贡献。
    今天，世界上没有任何力量能够把苏联和已经走上社会主义大道的人民民主国家再拉回资本主义。（掌声）
    我们活在为共产主义斗争的斯大林时代，在这个时代里，以苏联为首的社会主义阵线代表着和资本主义阵营相对立的、不可征服的力量。
    在苏联，工业与农业生产与日俱增，人民福利在增进而人民购买力在提高。
    鉴于美元购买力之下降，现在美元已非稳定的计算本位，因之改用黄金为苏联卢布官定兑换率的计算本位，这提供了我国国力增涨的实证。
  苏联卢布是世界上最稳定的货币
    卢布的购买力已高于其官定兑换率。因此，从今天起，苏联政府已经不再以美元为本位来规定卢布与外币的兑换率。而改用更稳定的黄金作为我国卢布的计算本位了。（长时间掌声）
    苏联卢布将是世界上最巩固最稳定的货币，因为它有苏联国民经济的进一步发展作为保障。（掌声）
    在资本主义国家中，毁灭性的经济危机——帝国主义者为逃避危机所采取的一切步骤在它的面前都已证明无能为力——是无可避免地来临了。
    为削弱经济危机的冲击而设计的马歇尔计划，也已经证明是无效的了。在马歇尔化了的国家中，工人阶级的生活水准正逐步降低，失业在增加而劳动群众正在变为绝对的和相对的贫穷。甚至根据极不完备的材料，在资本主义国家中，现在已经有了四千万以上的失业者与半失业者。
  把战争贩子一个不剩地全部暴露出来
    为了削弱即将来临的危机的毁灭性冲击，英美帝国主义者正在试图发动反对苏联与人民民主国家的新的帝国主义战争。
    从建国伊始就说过“全世界和平”的苏联，正在奉行着始终如一的和所有国家和平的列宁——斯大林政策：把战争贩子一个不剩地全部暴露出来的政策。
    这个为了各族人民和平与安全的斯大林政策，正为社会主义赢得了所有资本主义国家的劳动人民的同情，因为这种政策是符合于一切进步人类最切身的利益的。
    人民为争取和平与民族间合作的斗争一定会获得全面的成功，因为这一进步运动是由伟大斯大林所鼓舞的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟所领导的。（掌声）
    苏联人民正以新的生产胜利和由于国家与人民的财富之增加而获得了的新的福利，来迎接苏联最高苏维埃选举日。
    确信联共（布）党所奉行的列宁斯大林政策之正确性的苏联人民，忘我地忠诚于斯大林同志，并且正充满信心地前进着，向各国的劳动人民指明了通往光芒万丈的将来的道路。（掌声）
    联共（布）党中央委员会在其告全体选民（包括男女工人、男女农民、苏联陆海军人员及苏联知识分子）书中，号召苏维埃人民投票选举斯大林的党与非党联盟的候选人。
    还有几天，苏联人民就要投票选举苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃代表了。
    我确信乌拉尔的人民将选那些真正能够为我国共产主义之胜利而斗争的斯大林联盟的候选人。（暴风雨般的长时间掌声）
    作为伟大的列宁与斯大林党的一个党员，我将竭尽全力来为苏维埃社会主义国家之巩固与我国共产主义之胜利而斗争。（掌声）
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！（掌声）
    苏联共产党（布）——共产主义胜利的组织者万岁！（掌声）
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    为了苏联人民和一切进步人类的幸福与快乐，我们的英明领袖、导师与朋友伟大的斯大林万岁！（暴风雨般、长时间的掌声。全体起立。乐队奏苏联国歌）
    与会者通过了给斯维德洛夫斯克第十七选区苏联最高苏维埃民族院全体候选人的电文。
    与会者以极大的热情通过了向斯大林同志致贺的电文。
