　　Beijing搬运 Workers
    Denounce "Lobbying" Ringleaders
    Unanimously Demand Severe Punishment for Feudal Thugs
    [Beijing News Agency] On the morning of March 17th at approximately 8:00 AM, Beijing搬运 workers held a denunciation meeting at the Qianmen West Railway Station to condemn the feudal gang leaders Liu Deren, Jin Wenquan, Diao Sunlu, and others. Over 800 workers attended.

    Non-chief criminal elements will not be prosecuted if they repent and reform or change professions.
    The meeting was presided over by Chief Bai of the Police and Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau. In his opening remarks, he pointed out: "These feudal thugs colluded with the reactionary rulers during the periods of Japanese occupation and Kuomintang reactionary rule to oppress and exploit the workers. We have been oppressed by the feudal exploitation system for so many years! Now, our workers have been liberated. Today, we should expose the crimes of these thugs and bullies without reservation, so that the government can punish them." Then, one after another, the accusers rushed to the stage, painfully recounting how these thugs and bullies oppressed and exploited them. Wang Zhan'kui said: "In the past, we earned 25 cents for carrying a piece of luggage, but they didn't lift a finger and took 15 cents. They settled accounts every ten days, and the money was never enough. They were so ruthless! We suffered in silence because they had connections with the 'officials.' If anyone disagreed with them, they would be locked up or beaten for nothing. Liu Shiqi was beaten to death by Liu Deren with a shovel, but in the end, Liu Deren got away with it." Li Wenju said: "I drove a cart for Liu Deren for several years. He got rich and took a concubine, but I couldn't even afford a decent piece of clothing all year round. After liberation, he didn't allow us to join the union. Anyone who joined the union was fired." The crimes of Jin Wenquan and Diao Sunlu were also revealed by the masses one by one. The venue was filled with anger. Slogans such as "Thoroughly eliminate feudal bullies!" and "Demand the government to severely punish them!" rose and fell, and thousands of eyes stared intently at the three feudal thugs standing beside the stage. Comrade Peng Siming of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said in his speech: In the past, workers in Chaoyangmen were not allowed to搬运 things to Qianmen, but only allowed to work in a certain circle. This not only prevented our workers from uniting, but also hindered the smooth flow of goods transportation. This is the result of the feudal gang organization's separate division and exploitation, which we cannot tolerate. He also said: All of us workers must unite and fight against the remnants of "Lobbying," and report those who continue to do evil. Worker representative Su Jingsheng said: "The government has cleared out the bad elements for us. All of us workers must unite well and work hard to produce. We must guarantee the smooth flow of freight in Beijing." Government representative Wu, Deputy Director of the Third Division of the Public Security Bureau, said in his speech: "The government will definitely accept everyone's demands and severely punish these gang leaders, but as long as ordinary members and secondary members bow their heads to the people, honestly repent and reform, or change their professions, the government will never pursue the past." The denunciation meeting lasted until twelve o'clock before it ended. After the meeting, the Qianmen pedicab workers said: "What is liberation? In the past, the 'Lobbying' people could speak, but we couldn't. Now we can speak and are not afraid of them. This is called liberation." (Attached picture)

　　京市搬运工人
    控诉“搂包”首恶
    一致要求严惩封建流氓
    【京市新闻处讯】京市搬运工人于三月十七日上午八时许，在前门西车站举行控诉封建行头恶霸大会，控诉“搂包”首恶刘德仁、金文泉、刁荪禄等三人，到会工人群众八百余人。
  非首要流氓分子只要悔过自新或改业转业，政府决不追究既往
    大会由公安局警法科白科长主持，他在致词中指出：“这些封建流氓，过去在日寇统治时期，国民党反动统治时期，他们都和反动的统治者相互勾结来压迫工人，剥削工人。封建的剥削制度压迫我们已经多少年了！现在，咱们工人已经解放了。今天我们应该把这些流氓恶霸的罪行，毫无保留地诉说出来，好让政府来惩治他们。”接着，一个又一个的控诉者紧接着跑上台去，沉痛地追诉着这些流氓恶霸是如何的压迫他们，剥削他们。王展魁说：“过去俺们搬一件行李得二角五分，他们动也不动却要分去一角五，十天结回账，钱还不给够数，你说他们多狠呀！俺们受了气还不敢言语，他和“官家”有联络，谁给他不对词，就关谁，或者揍你一顿也白挨。刘示启是刘德仁拿铁锹打死的，结果弄来弄去刘德仁还是落得个没事。”李文举说：“咱给刘德仁赶了几年车，他发了财，讨了小老婆，咱却一年到头搂不到一件好衣服穿。解放后他还不许咱参加工会，谁要参加工会他就不要谁。”金文泉、刁荪禄的罪行也一件件的被群众揭露了出来。会场上充满了愤怒，“彻底消除封建恶霸！”“要求政府严办！”的口号总是此起彼伏，千百只眼睛圆睁睁地注视着站在台旁的三个封建流氓。市总工会彭思明同志在讲话中说：过去朝阳门的工人不许搬东西到前门来，只准在一定的圈子里活动，这样不但使我们工人不能团结，而且也妨碍货物运输的流畅，这是封建流氓组织分别割据剥削的结果，是我们不能容许存在的现象。他又说：我们全体工人要团结起来，向“搂包”的残余现象作斗争，检举继续作恶的分子。工人代表苏景生说：“政府给我们清除了坏分子，我们全体工人要好好地团结起来，努力生产，我们要向北京市的货运畅通提出保证。”政府代表公安局三处武副处长在讲话中说：“政府一定会接受大家的要求，严办这些流氓头子，但对一般分子和次要分子只要向人民低头，老老实实悔过自新或改业转业，政府决不追究既往。”控诉大会一直开到十二点才结束，会后前门排子车工人说：“什么叫翻身？早先‘搂包’们能说话，咱们不能说，现在咱们能说话，不怕他了，这就叫翻身。”（附图片）
