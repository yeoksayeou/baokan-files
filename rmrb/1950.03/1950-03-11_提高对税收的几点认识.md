　　Several Understandings to Improve on Taxation
    廖季立
    At present, the New Democratic economic construction has begun, and the whole country requires a stable currency. Without it, neither the economic system nor the financial system can develop normally. And the taxation system is precisely an important weapon to stabilize the currency and make the economic and financial systems develop normally. This is the experience of the Soviet Union's founding, and it is also the problem facing China's financial and economic system today.
    The fact is obvious that liberating Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, supporting nine million military, government, and educational personnel, and focusing on economic recovery are tasks that the Central People's Government must complete in 1950. These tasks cannot be changed. To ensure the completion of these tasks, there are only two ways out in terms of financial resources: either increase currency issuance or increase tax revenue (including agricultural tax). One of the two must be chosen. Other methods are not important. Increasing currency issuance, as is well known, will not only increase the burden on the broad masses of the people and the accompanying suffering in life, but will also continue to prolong the chaos in the market and hinder the normal development of the economy. This road cannot be taken and will not work. Therefore, increasing tax revenue has become an important link in the current financial and economic work.
    Many comrades echo the opinions of some capitalists in the city, believing that the current urban tax revenue is excessive and cannot be increased any further. I don't know from which aspect this is viewed? If we compare with the Kuomintang, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang's central tax revenue in the mainland (excluding Northeast China) in 1936 was more than 810 million silver dollars, not including miscellaneous taxes, local taxes, and surcharges; while our national tax revenue in 1950 (including Northeast China) (excluding agricultural tax), if we remove the part levied from public enterprises, its income may not exceed this number. Moreover, whether taxation is justified does not depend on the amount, but on whether it is "taken from the people and used for the people," and whether it is "taken reasonably and used appropriately." The Kuomintang's tax revenue was used to suppress the people and destroy production, while our tax revenue is used to support the People's Liberation War and develop production. This is the fundamental difference between the two. If we say that after several years of war, China's economic situation is far worse than before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and light taxes are needed to restore the national economy, but if Taiwan is not taken down, the major cities on the mainland will still be subject to enemy blockade and bombing. If we do not invest heavily in the industrial and mining production, railways, and shipping that have been destroyed by the enemy, how can we quickly recover? What do we rely on for these expenses if not normal tax revenue? Lao Tzu's so-called "governing by non-action" is just a reactionary fantasy. It is not realistic to demand the restoration of production with light taxes. This statement is objectively beneficial to the enemy, large capitalists, and speculators, but harmful to the broad masses of working people.
    Many comrades do not object to levying taxes on private enterprises, but believe that it is unreasonable to levy taxes on state-owned enterprises, because state-owned enterprises belong to the state, and there is no need to levy taxes again. This view only has one side of the truth, but not the whole picture. In essence, this is an irresponsible attitude towards the operation and development of state-owned enterprises. In principle, the New Democratic economy is the sum of the state-owned economy, the private economy, and the cooperative economy. Therefore, the source of New Democratic finance should also be the combination of taking from the private sector and taking from the public sector. The private economy certainly has the obligation to pay taxes, and the state-owned economy also has the obligation to pay taxes. With the development of the state-owned economy, its proportion and importance of taxation will increase even more. The contribution of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China to finance has already far exceeded that of private enterprises. Furthermore, in terms of specific circumstances, the taxation of state-owned enterprises has many functions and benefits: it can strengthen the sense of responsibility for operating state-owned enterprises, and make them quickly move towards enterprise and economic accounting systems; it can encourage everyone to save funds, so that the capital turnover of state-owned enterprises can be greatly improved; it can enable the government to plan to regulate and expand the reproduction of state-owned enterprises; it can subsidize the insufficient national financial revenue and gradually become the main force in finance. Therefore, the central government's decision to tax state-owned enterprises this time is very necessary and timely.
    Many comrades also believe that tax work is just about collecting taxes, purely administrative work, without policy or principles, so this work is not important. If we say that our people's government has a series of policies for the development of the New Democratic economy, then the taxation system is precisely a concrete link in this series of policies. Therefore, we are not just collecting taxes for the sake of collecting taxes. We must follow the following principles to ensure financial revenue, help stabilize the currency, and make the economic and financial systems move towards normal development: First, encourage the vigorous development of the economy that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; second, restrict and ban the economy that is not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood; third, protect the domestic public and private economy, and resist the economic aggression of imperialism; fourth, regulate capital and adjust the imbalance of wealth between classes. There is no doubt that the importance of these effects will be fully and surely demonstrated in a few years. If we do not see this point, and hold old and contemptuous views on tax work, we will make mistakes in our work.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has pointed out: "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that completing this year's tax revenue plan is an important link in overcoming financial difficulties and realizing the 1950 budget. Therefore, it is the responsibility of party committees at all levels to... overcome the erroneous view of underestimating tax work that exists in the minds of cadres, so as to ensure the complete completion of this year's tax revenue plan." Let us work hard! Change the incorrect understanding of taxation, raise our awareness, and strive to complete this year's tax revenue plan!

　　提高对税收的几点认识
    廖季立
    目前新民主主义经济建设已经开始，全国要求有一个稳定的货币。没有它，不论经济制度与财政制度，都不能正常发展。而税收制度恰恰是使货币稳定，使经济财政制度走向正常发展的一个重要武器。苏联建国的经验是如此，今天中国财经制度上面临着的问题也是如此。
    事实很明显，解放台湾、西藏与海南岛，养活军政公教人员九百万人，及经济上的重点恢复，是中央人民政府在一九五○年必须完成的任务。这些任务是不能改变的，为保证这些任务的完成，在财政来源上只有两个出路：或者是增加通货发行，或者是增加税收（包括农业税）收入，二者必居其一。其他的办法都不是重要的。增加通货发行，如众所周知，不但将增加广大人民的负担，与随之而来的生活痛苦；而且会继续延长市场的混乱现象，阻滞经济的正常发展。这条路是不能走也是走不通的。因此增加税收就成为目前财经工作中的重要环节。
    有许多同志附和着城市中某些资本家的意见，认为现在城市税收过量，不可能再增加。不知这是从那个方面来看？如果说与国民党比较，国民党在抗战前，除东北外，仅关内中央正税收入，一九三六年计收折银元八亿一千余万元，杂税、地方税与附加尚未计算在内；而我们一九五○年全国（连东北在内）税收（不包括农业税）如除去征之于公营企业者外，其收入亦未必超过此数。而且税收的是否正当，不决定于轻重，而决定于是否“取之于民，用之于民”，是否“取之合理，用之得当”。国民党的税收用于镇压人民，破坏生产，而我们的税收则用于支持人民解放战争，用于发展生产，这是两者基本不同所在。如果说，经过若干年战争以后，中国经济情况已大不如抗战以前，需要轻税使国民经济得到恢复。但台湾不打下，大陆上各大城市仍时受敌人的封锁和轰炸。被敌人所破坏的工矿生产和铁道，航轮等，不大量投资，如何能迅速恢复？这些开支不依靠正常的税收收入，又依靠什么？老子所谓“无为而治”不过是一个反动的幻想。要求用轻税来恢复生产是不合现实的。这种说法客观上是对敌人，大资本家与投机商人有利，而对广大劳苦群众有害的。
    还有许多同志不反对向私营企业征税，但认为对国营企业征税是不合理的，因国营企业就是国家的，没有再加征税的必要。此种看法只有一面的道理，而不是全面的。实质上这是对国营企业的经营与发展采取不负责任的态度。从原则上讲，新民主主义经济是国营经济、私营经济与合作社经济的总和。因此新民主主义的财政来源也应该是取之于私与取之于公二者的相互结合。私营经济固然有纳税的义务，国营经济同样也有纳税的义务。随着国营经济的发展其纳税的比例与重要性更将增大，东北国营企业对财政上的贡献，即已远过私营企业。再从具体情况来讲，国营企业的征税，其作用与好处是很多的：它可以加强经营国营企业的责任心，使它迅速地走向企业化与经济核算制度；可以鼓励大家节省资金，使国营企业资金周转大大提高；可以使政府有计划地调剂与扩大国营企业的再生产；可以补助国家财政收入的不足，逐渐成为财政上的主要力量。因此，此次中央决定国营企业的征税，是非常必要与切合时宜的。
    还有许多同志认为税收工作只是收税，纯粹事务工作，没有政策性与原则性的，因此这一工作是不重要的。如果说，我们的人民政府对新民主主义经济发展是有一系列的政策的话，那末税收制度恰是这一系列政策的一个具体环节。因此我们不是光为征税而征税，必须要在下列原则下来保障财政收入，帮助通货稳定，使经济财政制度走向正常发展的途径：第一、鼓励有利于国计民生的经济大量发展；第二、限制与取缔不利于国计民生的经济；第三、保护国内公私经济，抵制帝国主义的经济侵略；第四、节制资本，调整阶级间财富的不平衡。不用怀疑，这些作用的重大，不要经过几年的时间就会充分与确实地证明出来。如果我们看不到这点，对税收工作抱着陈旧的与轻视的观点，我们就将要在工作中犯错误。
    中共中央已经指出：“中共中央认为完成今年的税收预定计划，是克服财政困难和实现一九五○年概算的重要环节，因此责成各级党委务必……克服干部思想上存在着的轻视税务工作的错误观点，以保证今年税收计划的全部完成。”让我们努力吧！改变对税收的不正确认识，提高我们的觉悟，为完成今年的税收计划而奋斗！
