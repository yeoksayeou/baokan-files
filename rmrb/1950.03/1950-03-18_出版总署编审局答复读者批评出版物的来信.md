To the People's Daily People's Garden Group, and forwarded to the Zhengding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Liu Zhao of Beijing, Li Shudao of Shanghai, Wen Kui of Zhangjiakou, and Wang Lianbao of Pingshun County:

　　(1) Your transmittal of four readers' letters criticizing publications on February 6th is acknowledged with thanks.

　　(2) The letters from Wen Kui, Xu Yuan, and Li Shudao, among others, regarding the criticisms of the dictionaries published by Chunming and Beixin bookstores, have been previously noted. In addition to sending copies of these opinions to the respective bookstores, the Bureau will retain the letters for reference when writing book reviews.

　　(3) Wang Lianbao's letter criticizing the old lunar calendar is well received. This year's calendars were not prepared in time and were distributed too late, so the circulation of old folk calendars is still unavoidable. This is a long-term process of education and transformation. Next year, we should plan and prepare earlier. We are responding accordingly. Please convey the above opinions to the readers and extend our gratitude.

　　With best regards!
　　Publication Administration Editorial Bureau of the Central People's Government
　　March 8th.

　　出版总署编审局答复读者批评出版物的来信
    人民日报人民园地组并转中共正定县委会、北京刘昭、上海李书导、张家口文魁、平顺县王连保诸先生：
    （１）二月六日转来读者批评出版物的来信四件，敬悉。
    （２）文魁许元李书导等三函，其中对于春明及北新两书店所刊辞典的批评，前已有人指出，本局除将此项意见抄寄各该书店外，并将来函留本局供撰写书评时参考。
    （３）王连保来函批评旧历书的意见很好，今年的历书因为我们准备不及，发行太迟，民间旧历书的发现还是难免的，这也是一个长期教育改造的过程，来年我们应有计划的早作准备。相应函复，希将以上意见转达读者，并代致谢忱，是荷。
    此致敬礼！中央人民政府出版总署编审局启
        三、八。
