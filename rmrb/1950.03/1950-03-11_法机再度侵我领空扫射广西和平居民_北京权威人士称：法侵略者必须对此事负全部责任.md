Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. According to delayed news from Guangxi: On February 1st of this year, French planes invaded our airspace from Vietnam and strafed wantonly in Shangshi Township, Jin'ai Village, and Jiaocetun, all under the jurisdiction of Pingxiang County in Guangxi Province, killing one and injuring one local resident. Note: As early as December 14th of last year, five French planes had already invaded our airspace and circled for reconnaissance over Ningming County in Guangxi. The unreasonable behavior of French planes repeatedly violating Chinese airspace and strafing peaceful Chinese residents has aroused great indignation in Beijing. Authoritative sources here say that the French aggressors must bear full responsibility for the strafing incident.

    【新华社北京十日电】据广西迟到消息：本年二月一日曾有法国飞机由越南侵入我国领空，在广西境内凭祥县属上石乡、津隘村、叫册屯等地肆虐扫射，当地人民死一伤一。按：早在去年十二月十四日，即已发生过法国飞机五架侵入我国领空在广西宁明县上空盘旋侦察的事件。法国飞机一再侵犯中国领空，并扫射中国和平居民的无理行为，已引起北京各方的极大愤怒。此间权威人士称：法国侵略者必须对扫射事件负全部责任。
