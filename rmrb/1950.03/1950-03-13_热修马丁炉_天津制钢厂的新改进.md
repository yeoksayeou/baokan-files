　　Hot Repair of Open-Hearth Furnace
　　——New Improvement at Tianjin Steel Plant
　　The front wall of the open-hearth furnace at Tianjin Steel Plant showed signs of damage at the end of last year. At the beginning of this year, after inspection by Soviet experts, it was determined that repairs were necessary. It was suggested that the previous method of cold repair after shutting down the furnace should be changed to hot repair to shorten repair time and increase steel production.

　　At that time, some workers felt that repairing the wall without shutting down the furnace, when steel blocks melted into liquid in the furnace with temperatures of over 1,000 degrees Celsius, was simply unimaginable. Other workers believed that since Soviet experts had proposed hot repair, they might have had such experience in the Soviet Union, so it was worth a try.

　　Soviet experts explained that the fire in the furnace could be turned down, but not extinguished, and a temporary heat-insulating wall could be built inside the furnace with fire bricks before repairing the front wall. Encouraged and guided by them, the workers recognized the benefits of hot repair and changed their skeptical attitude.

　　At 2:30 PM on January 7th, steelmaking was stopped and wall repair began. Because the furnace bottom was uneven, waste steel and limestone were first used to level the furnace bottom, and then the temporary heat-insulating wall was built.

　　Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the workers braved the high heat, using long-handled fire shovels and large tongs to send bricks one by one into the furnace to build the wall. As it neared completion at 10 PM, it was suddenly discovered that the western part of the heat-insulating wall had a tendency to fall backward. It turned out that there were waste pipes in the waste steel underneath; in the empty places, they softened when encountering high heat, the bottom sank, and the wall finally collapsed.

　　If people did not enter the furnace to work, rebuilding it would take five hours. While the Soviet experts were anxiously trying to find a remedy, Pan Changyou, the open-hearth furnace foreman, volunteered. He soaked all his cotton clothes, gloves, shoes, socks, and hat in cold water and stepped into the furnace to lay bricks. At this time, the furnace temperature was as high as 700 degrees Celsius, and the bricks had turned red. Driven by Pan Changyou, workers Chen Zuoxiang, Yang Xien, and 16 others also entered the furnace one after another to take turns repairing the wall. Employees not on duty also came to help pass bricks. Under these tense circumstances, the rebuilding of the heat-insulating wall was completed in about an hour.

　　At 8 AM on the 8th, the entire front wall was repaired, and the gas elbows at both ends and the northwest and southwest corners were also repaired.

　　When the temporary heat-insulating wall was finally dismantled, in order to speed up completion and minimize damage to the fire bricks, the workers on the open-hearth furnace entered the furnace a second time and moved the fire bricks out one by one. The bottom fire bricks were particularly hot because they were bonded to the waste steel, but under the leadership of Pan Changyou, the fire bricks were finally taken out. The furnace repair task was completed at 11:30 AM. The total furnace repair time was 21 hours. Compared with shutdown repair, this saved five-sixths of the time and greatly increased production. The workers completed the task under these difficult conditions and received high praise from the Soviet experts: "With such workers in China who are not afraid of difficulties, nothing is impossible to accomplish!"

　　Except for problems with the roof and bottom of the open-hearth furnace, the hot repair method can generally be used. For example, when the gas nozzle was damaged on January 18th, as soon as the furnace stopped, the workers braved the high heat to dismantle the wall. Yang Cuifang, the chief engineer of the open-hearth furnace, tried to block the flaming outlet with the furnace door so that the bricklayers could approach for repairs. The project, which used to take three days, was completed in 11 hours and 50 minutes.

　　To thank the experts for helping them improve their technical level and giving them many new experiences, the workers wrote a thank-you note on red satin, signed by all the workers on the open-hearth furnace and the person in charge of the workshop, and presented it to the Soviet experts as a souvenir.

　　This incident further strengthened the confidence of all employees in completing the 1950 production task and deepened the profound friendship between the employees and the Soviet experts!

### 热修马丁炉——天津制钢厂的新改进

　　热修马丁炉
    ——天津制钢厂的新改进
    天津制钢厂马丁炉的前墙，在去年底已经呈显损坏情况。今年年初，经苏联专家检查结果，认为应加修理。并建议把以往停炉冷修的办法，改为热修，以缩短修理时间，增加钢的产量。
    当时，一部分工人认为在摄氏一千多度的炉子里，钢块进去都要化成水的情况下，不停炉修墙，简直不可想像。另一部分工人则认为苏联专家既然提出热修的办法，在苏联可能有过这样的经验，不妨试试。
    苏联专家解释说，可将炉中的火关小，但不熄灭，再用火砖在炉内垒一道临时隔热墙，再修前墙。工人们在他的鼓舞和指导下，工人们认识热修的好处，转变了怀疑的态度。
    一月七日，下午二时三十分停止炼钢，开始修墙。因炉底凸凹不平，先用废钢及石灰石铺平炉底，然后再垒临时隔热墙。
    工友们在苏联专家指导下，冒着高热，先用长柄的火铲和大钳子将砖一块块的送进炉子垒墙。到夜晚十时将近完成时，突然发现隔热墙西部有后倒趋势。原来下面所垫的废钢内有废管子；在空虚的地方，遇高热软化，底部下陷，墙终于倒塌。
    人如果不进入炉里工作，重垒一次需要五小时。苏联专家正在着急设法补救时，马丁炉领班潘长有自报奋勇。把棉衣、手套、鞋袜、帽子等全部冷水浸湿，挺身进入炉内垒砖。这时炉温高达七○○度，砖都变红了。在潘长有的带动下，工人陈作祥、杨锡恩等十六人也相继进去，轮替修墙。不在班的职工也来帮助递砖。在这种紧张情况下，一小时左右完成了重垒隔热墙。
    八日上午八时，全部前墙修竣，并修复了两端的煤气弯头及西北、西南两转角。
    最后拆除临时隔热墙时，为了加速完成，并尽量不使火砖损坏，马丁炉上的工友们二次进入炉内，把火砖又一块块的搬出来。底部火砖因与废钢粘合，温度特高，但在潘长有的带动下，终于将火砖拿出来。于上午十一时三十分完成修炉任务。计全部修炉时间共二十一小时。较停炉修理节省六分之五的时间，大大增加了生产。工人们在这种艰苦的条件下完成任务，获得苏联专家的大加赞许：“中国有这样不怕困难的工友，将无事不可完成！”
    马丁炉的修理，除了炉顶炉底发生毛病外，一般都可采用热修法。如一月十八日煤气喷出口损坏，炉子刚停，工友们便冒着高热动手拆墙，马丁炉主管工程师杨萃芳设法用炉门将冒火口堵住，使瓦工能接近修理，过去需时三天的工程，结果用十一小时五十分便修好了。
    工友们为感谢专家帮助他们提高了技术水平，使他们得到好多新的经验，乃用红缎子写一谢词，由马丁炉全体工友及工场负责人联名签字送给苏联专家以作纪念。
    这件事更加强了全体职工完成一九五○年生产任务的信心，也加深了职工们与苏联专家间深厚的友谊！
