　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiongyai, 29th—In the Qiongyai liberated areas, studying culture has become a conscious demand of the masses. Elementary schools, night schools, and literacy classes have been widely established in many townships and villages throughout the area. For example, in Fanyang Township, Ledong County, there are now nine public and private elementary schools, twenty-four night schools and literacy classes, with a total of 1,062 farmers participating in learning, accounting for three-quarters of the township's population. Among them, only the central elementary school is run by the government; the rest of the elementary schools, night schools, and literacy classes are established by the farmers themselves, with the government only providing teachers and textbooks. Due to the extensive development of cultural and educational work, the level of consciousness and production enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly improved. Not only have learning pledges and hygiene pledges been established in various villages, but also production discipline.
　　The reason why cultural and educational work in the Qiongyai liberated areas has achieved the above-mentioned results is mainly because the leading organs have carried out patient enlightenment and education in advance. The majority of the Qiongyai liberated areas are inhabited by the Li people. Because they had been deceived and fooled by the Kuomintang reactionaries and a small number of feudal Li chiefs for a long time, they still had some concerns about many measures of the People's Government in the early days of liberation. For example, when the People's Government began to run schools, some of them believed that the government ran schools to "recruit people into the army" and that "studying is to become a public servant." Therefore, they adopted a set of methods to deal with the "old government" by hiring some people from each village to study. Therefore, the People's Government first conducted universal explanations among students and their parents, village representatives, and farmers' associations, and timely eliminated their concerns. In order to encourage the masses to send their children to school, the People's Government not only taught students to read in public schools but also educated students to help with household production. Many students who could read more and made rapid progress at school actively helped with housework at home. At the same time, the People's Government used public elementary schools as the foundation for promoting the literacy movement and opened night schools or literacy classes in nearby rural areas. When the masses realized the benefits of studying culture, they all asked the government to help them run schools.

　　琼崖人民学习文化
    政府大力启发黎族人民学习
    【新华社琼崖二十九日电】在琼崖解放区，学习文化已经成为群众自觉的要求。全区的许多乡镇和村庄已经普遍地建立了小学、夜校和识字班。如乐东县的番阳乡，全乡现有公私立小学九所，夜校、识字班二十四处，参加学习的农民共达一千零六十二人，占全乡人口的四分之三。其中除了中心小学一所是政府办的以外，其余小学、夜校和识字班都是农民自己开办的，政府只供给教员和课本。由于文化教育工作的广泛开展，群众的觉悟程度和生产积极性已大大提高。各村庄不但订立了学习公约、卫生公约，还订立了生产纪律。
    琼崖解放区的文化教育工作所以获得上述的成绩，主要是由于领导机关在事先进行了耐心的启发教育。琼崖解放区大部分是黎族人民，由于他们曾长期受了国民党反动派和少数封建黎首的欺骗、愚弄的影响，所以在解放初期对于人民政府的许多措施还存在着某些顾虑。如在人民政府开始举办学校时，他们有的就认为政府举办学校是为了“要人当兵”、“读书是变公家人”，于是就采取了应付“老政府”的一套办法，由各村雇一些人去读书。因此人民政府首先便在学生和学生家长、各村代表和农会中，进行了普遍的解释，及时地消除了他们的顾虑。人民政府为了鼓励群众送子弟入学，在公立学校中不但教学生识字，而且教育学生帮助家中生产。许多在学校识字多、进步快的学生，在家中都积极地帮家里干活。同时，人民政府并以公立小学作为推广识字运动的基础，在附近农村开办夜校或识字班。当群众认识到学习文化的好处后，都纷纷要求政府帮助他们办学校。
