　　Uniting, Transforming, and Elevating Traditional Chinese Medicine
	Ministry of Health Invites TCM Practitioners for Discussions
	Beijing Prepares to Establish TCM Association
　　[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, in order to unite practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and raise the scientific and technical level of existing TCM, convened a symposium for TCM practitioners on February 27th. Attendees included TCM doctors Zhao Shuping, Yu Daoji, Pan Zhaopeng, and twenty others, as well as doctors Meng Zhaowei, Li Tao, and Li Jiahe, who have a long-standing research interest in TCM, and Peng Zemin, a member of the Central People's Government, who was invited to attend and provide guidance. At the meeting, Peng Zemin first listed the facts of how TCM had been persecuted by imperialism in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and within China, explaining that it was impossible for TCM to be elevated under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past. He pointed out that today TCM is different and should unite and cooperate with all medical personnel under the leadership of the People's Government to guarantee the health of the people. Li Dequan, Minister of the Ministry of Health, pointed out in her speech: TCM practitioners are spread throughout every region of China. They have a close historical relationship with the Chinese people, a considerable number, and a certain mass base; therefore, the Ministry of Health attaches particular importance to the issue of TCM. She called on TCM practitioners to abandon prejudices, accept new things, learn scientific knowledge, use scientific methods, cooperate with Western medicine, and strive to enrich and transform themselves, and serve the people faithfully. Subsequently, Huang Dingchen, Director of the Medical Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Health, explained that the government plans to transform the North China College of Traditional Medicine into a TCM advanced studies college, to serve as a school for absorbing experience and setting an example for the whole country. The TCM doctors present unanimously expressed their support for the government's call and willingness to accept scientific knowledge and unite with TCM practitioners across the country to move forward together. Pan Zhaopeng said, "The past governments never cared about us. The former National Medicine Hall only used the name to raise the status of individuals. Today, the People's Government values us, and the people need us, so we should work hard to do more for the people. Moreover, we must engage in criticism and self-criticism in order to progress." Regarding the issue of academic research, Wei Longxiang said, "We must break feudal superstitions, there should be no selfish secret recipes, and we must transform TCM knowledge into popular, scientific knowledge." Many others expressed their personal opinions. The meeting also resolved to establish a preparatory committee for the Beijing TCM Association and passed a motion to appoint the TCM and Western medicine doctors attending the symposium as preparatory committee members, and elected Zhao Shuping, Pan Zhaopeng, and Yu Daoji as conveners of the preparatory committee.

　　团结改造提高中医
    卫生部邀中医座谈
    京市筹组中医学会
    【本报讯】中央人民政府卫生部为了团结中医，提高现有中医的科学技术水平，特于二月二十七日召开了中医座谈会。到会的有中医师赵树屏、于道济、潘兆鹏等二十人，及对中医学术素有研究的医师孟昭威、李涛、力嘉禾等三人，中央人民政府委员彭泽民亦应邀出席指导。会上，彭泽民首先列举过去中医在香港、台湾以及国内受到帝国主义迫害的事实，说明过去在国民党反动政府统治下，中医是不可能得到提高的。他指出：今天中医不同了，中医应该在人民政府的领导下，与一切医药人员团结合作，来保证人民的健康。卫生部李德全部长在讲话中指出：中医遍布在中国的每个地区。他们与中国人民有历史上的密切关系，有相当大的数量，也有一定的群众基础，因此卫生部对于中医问题特别重视。她号召中医：要抛弃成见，接受新的东西，学习科学知识，利用科学方法；并与西医合作，努力充实自己，改造自己，忠实地为人民服务。其后，卫生部医政局局长黄鼎臣说明政府拟将华北国医学院，改为中医进修学院，作为吸取经验示范全国的学校。到会各中医师均一致表示拥护政府的号召，愿意接受科学知识，团结全国中医一道前进。潘兆鹏说：“过去的政府从来是不管我们的。过去的国医馆，也只是利用名义提高私人的地位。今天人民政府重视我们，人民需要我们，我们就应该很好地为人民多作一些工作。而且我们要展开批评与自我批评，才能进步。”关于学术研究问题，魏龙骧说：“我们要打破封建的迷信，不该有自私的秘方，要把中医学识改造成为大众的、科学的学识。”其他很多人都发表了个人的意见。会上并决议成立北京中医学会筹备委员会；通过以出席此次座谈会的中西医师为筹备委员，并推举了赵树屏、潘兆鹏、于道济三人为筹委会的召集人。
