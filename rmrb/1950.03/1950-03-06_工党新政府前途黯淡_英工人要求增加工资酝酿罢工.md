Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: The British Labour Party, which won only a slight majority in the recent election, announced its new cabinet list on the evening of February 28th after deciding to form a government alone. Prime Minister Attlee, Deputy Prime Minister Morrison, Foreign Secretary Bevin, Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, Home Secretary Ede, President of the Board of Trade Wilson, Minister of Labour Isaacs, and Minister of Health Bevan all remained in their positions; the more significant changes were: Griffiths replaced Jones as Colonial Secretary, as Jones had been abandoned by voters for implementing bloody colonial suppression policies in Malaya and West Africa; former Secretary of State for War Shinwell was transferred to the position of Minister of Defence, and former Minister of Food Strachey succeeded him as Secretary of State for War; former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Dalton was transferred to the position of Minister of Town and Country Planning.

As Attlee indicated, the new cabinet will follow the policies of the past four and a half years, namely, relying on the United States, opposing the Soviet Union, protecting the interests of big capital, and suppressing workers' demands – the same conservative policies. After the election results were announced, various commentators pointed out that the Labour Party's future path would inevitably involve seeking compromise with the Conservative Party in order to prolong its existence. Indeed, according to a United Press report on the 2nd, after its formation, the Attlee cabinet decided to abandon the Iron and Steel Nationalization Act, passed by Parliament last October as an election gesture, and would not undertake any further nationalization in order to ease the opposition from the Conservative Party.

How to respond to the workers' demands for cuts in military spending, increased wages, and the genuine implementation of nationalization plans and social welfare programs, while also satisfying the Conservative Party's demands that the Labour Party completely abandon its "socialist" banner, is a dilemma currently facing the Labour Party's right-wing leaders. In addition, an unprecedentedly large military budget must be submitted to the House of Commons within a month. Therefore, even the Labour Party's Daily Herald had to admit that the Labour government's lifespan would not be too long.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: The Labour Party leaders, who had just survived the election struggle, immediately encountered a movement by workers demanding wage increases. According to a United Press report, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with over two million members, has proposed that members vote on a strike to support the demand for a general wage increase of one pound per week. Fifteen hundred dockworkers in London went on strike on the 2nd. Automobile workers are also brewing strikes demanding wage increases. According to a Central News Agency report, 400,000 railway workers had long ago put forward the demand for a minimum weekly wage of five pounds. Engineering workers in Chatham, a shipbuilding town in southeastern England, held a march less than forty-eight hours after the election ended, demanding a wage increase of one pound. The Trades Councils Federation of Lancashire and Cheshire unanimously protested "profiteering obtained by suppressing workers' living standards" at its meeting this week.

### 工党新政府前途黯淡  英工人要求增加工资酝酿罢工

　　工党新政府前途黯淡
    英工人要求增加工资酝酿罢工
    【新华社北京五日电】于此次选举中仅获微弱多数的英国工党，在决定单独组阁之后，已于二月二十八日晚宣布新阁名单。首相艾德礼、副首相莫里逊、外相贝文、财相克利浦斯、内相伊迪、商务大臣威尔逊、劳工大臣伊萨克斯、卫生大臣比万等，一律照旧；较大的变动是：以葛里菲斯继琼斯出任殖民大臣，琼斯因在马来亚及西非执行血腥的殖民地镇压政策已遭选民抛弃；原陆军大臣辛威尔调任国防大臣，而由原粮食大臣斯特拉彻继任陆军大臣；原任兰开斯特大法官达尔顿调任城乡计划大臣。
    如艾德礼所表示的，新阁将一本四年半来的政策，即投靠美国、反对苏联、卫护大资本的利益和压制工人要求的保守党政策。大选揭晓以后，各方评论曾经指出，工党今后的路线，必然更求与保守党觅致妥协，以便苟延残喘。果然，据合众社二日电报道，艾德礼内阁在组成之后，即决定放弃去年十月作为竞选姿态在国会通过的钢铁国有化法案，并不再作任何进一步的国有化，以缓和保守党的反对。
    如何应付工人方面关于削减军费、增加工资和真正贯彻国有化计划以及社会福利事业的要求，同时又满足保守党方面关于工党应完全丢开“社会主义”招牌的要求，乃是工党右翼领袖们目前左右为难的事情。此外，空前庞大的军事预算，又得在一个月以内向下院提出。因此，甚至连工党的每日先驱报，也不得不承认工党政府的寿命不会太长。
    【新华社北京五日电】刚刚渡过了选举斗争的工党领袖们，立刻就遇到了工人们要求增加工资的运动。据合众社消息：拥有二百多万会员的机器工人工会，已提议会员表决罢工，以支持每周普遍增加工资一镑的要求。伦敦的一千五百名码头工人，已于二日罢工。汽车工人也在酝酿着要求增加工资的罢工。另据电通社消息：四十万铁路工人老早就提出了每周工资最低五英镑的要求。英格兰东南部造船城茶坦姆的机器工人，在选举结束之后不到四十八小时，即举行游行，要求增加工资一英镑。兰开夏和柴郡的工会联合会理事会，本星期开会时一致抗议“抑低工人生活水准而获致的暴利”。
