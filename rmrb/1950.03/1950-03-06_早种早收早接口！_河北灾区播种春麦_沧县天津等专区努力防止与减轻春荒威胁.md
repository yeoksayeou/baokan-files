　　“Sow Early, Reap Early, Connect Early!”
    Hebei Disaster Areas Plant Spring Wheat
    Cangxian and Tianjin Regions Strive to Prevent and Mitigate Spring Famine Threats
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to sow early-maturing crops to prevent and mitigate the threat of spring famine, most counties in the Cangxian and Tianjin regions of Hebei Province have begun planting spring wheat. The Central People's Government allocated 2.1 million jin of relief grain to the Cangxian region at the beginning of last month, and it was fully distributed to the counties by the 6th of last month. The Cangxian region also provided spring wheat seeds on loan at the same time. By the 8th, the counties under the Cangxian region, including Qingxian, Huanghua, Cangxian, Jianguo, and Xianxian, had loaned out 520,000 jin of spring wheat seeds, and Qingxian had distributed all of it to the households. The masses in the above counties are very eager to plant spring wheat. Most farmers say: "If you don't act in the seventh and eighth nines, you'll be wringing your hands in the ninth nine." Also, because most of the land in the disaster area is wet and will be difficult to sow after thawing, farmers in Qingxian, Huanghua and other counties took advantage of the frozen ground to sow ten days ago. Currently, 14 households in Niuzhuang, Huanghua County, have taken advantage of the frozen ground to plant 110 mu. The masses in Majiaqiao and other villages in Qingxian County are also actively planting. The Tianjin region also loaned all the wheat seeds to the counties around the 10th, and farmers in Wen'an, Baodi and other counties are also actively planting. In order to lead the farmers of the county to plant spring wheat in a timely manner, the Baodi County Government and the Baodi County Committee of the Communist Party of China determined that the period from the 20th to the end of last month would be a concentrated week of activity. Five county committees have led 94 cadres from their offices to various districts to inspect the distribution of grain and the integration of organization and production, and actively lead the masses to plant spring wheat. At the same time, the leading organs of the county government, in addition to sending people to the countryside to specifically help the masses to plant, also organized agricultural assistance and planting teams, with the county chief as the captain, divided into five teams, to help the masses to plant during the rest time from 3 pm to 4 pm every day. At present, the masses in various districts have taken active action under the slogan of "Sow Early, Reap Early, Connect Early." On the 21st, more than 4,000 people in the first district were engaged in planting wheat, and more than 3,800 mu of "ninth nine wheat" were planted on that day.

　　“早种早收早接口！”
    河北灾区播种春麦
    沧县天津等专区努力防止与减轻春荒威胁
    【本报讯】为播种早熟作物防止与减轻春荒威胁，河北省沧县、天津两专区大部县已开始播种春麦。中央人民政府于上月初先后拨发沧县专区的二百一十万斤救济粮，已于上月六日全部分配到县。沧县专区又将春麦种同时贷下。到八日止，沧县专区所辖青县、黄骅、沧县、建国、献县等已贷发春麦种五十二万斤，青县已全部贷发到户。上述各县群众对种春麦很迫切，大部农民说：“七九、八九不动手，一到九九干搓手。”又因灾区大部地湿，化冻后就不好播种，所以在十日前，青县、黄骅等县农民即趁冻播种。现黄骅县牛庄十四户农民已趁冻种上一百一十亩。青县马家桥等村群众也正在积极播种。天津专区也于十日前后将麦种全部贷到县里，现文安、宝坻等县农民也在积极进行播种。宝坻县政府和中共宝坻县委会，为了领导全县农民及时播种春麦，确定上月二十至月底为突击周。五个县委已带机关干部九十四人分赴各区检查粮食发放与组织生产结合工作，并积极领导群众进行播种春麦。同时县政府各领导机关，除派人下乡具体帮助群众进行播种外，又组织了助耕播种队，以县长为队长分组五个分队，每日下午三点至四点休息时间，帮助群众进行播种。现各区群众已在“早种早收早接口”的口号下，积极行动起来。二十一日，一区即有四千余人从事种麦，当日即播种“九九麦”三千八百余亩。
