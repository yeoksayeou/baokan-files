　　Democratic Management Improves Production
    Beijing Garment General Factory Establishes Factory Management Committee
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Garment General Factory held a meeting of worker representatives at 2:00 PM on the 24th of last month. After democratic elections, the Factory Management Committee was formally established. At the meeting, the representatives unanimously understood that the establishment of the Factory Management Committee was to improve production. Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized in his speech that the only task of the Management Committee and the trade union was to improve production. He pointed out: The production problem is the most basic and effective way to solve all problems. If production is improved, other issues such as wages and benefits can be properly resolved. Regarding the powers and relationships between the Management Committee, the Worker Representative Congress, and the factory director, Vice Chairman Xiao Ming also made a brief explanation. Subsequently, the factory director, Li Zuobin, gave a detailed report on the factory's current production tasks, hoping that worker representatives and the Management Committee could deeply discuss and provide opinions. Finally, the conference elected Song Youxin and 12 others as members of the Factory Management Committee.
