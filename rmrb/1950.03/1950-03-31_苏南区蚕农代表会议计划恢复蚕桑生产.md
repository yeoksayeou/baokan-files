　　Suzhou-Southern Region Silkworm Farmer Representatives Meeting Plans to Restore Silkworm Production
    [From our paper] According to the Liberation Daily, the Suzhou-Southern Region Silkworm Farmer Representatives Meeting (held in the middle of this month), representing 150,000 silkworm farming households in Suzhou-Southern region, passed the 1950 Silkworm Production Plan, laying the foundation for this spring's silkworm rearing work. The main purpose of the meeting, as pointed out by the Secretary-General of the Congress, was to mobilize silkworm farmers to actively raise silkworms and complete the 1950 silkworm production task. The general guiding principle of the 1950 silkworm production plan passed during the meeting for the Suzhou-Southern Region is: to actively unite and organize the vast number of silkworm farmers, to maintain the existing production level as much as possible, and on the basis of the existing level, strive to restore production in a planned and step-by-step manner. The specific tasks are: to require the production of 130,000 *shi dan* of fresh cocoons throughout 1950, to promote 600,000 sheets of spring and autumn silkworm eggs (including 150,000 sheets of loaned eggs), and to promote 2 million mulberry seedlings. To produce: 20 million grafted mulberry seedlings, 1 million seedlings grown from seed, 23,000 sheets of original silkworm eggs, and 1.2 million sheets of ordinary silkworm eggs.
