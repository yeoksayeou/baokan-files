    (Thirty-seven)
    Niang was already asleep, holding Jinbao. When Cui Cui saw Niang, her face couldn't help but turn red, and she felt an indescribable sadness. She looked at the rotten box on the ground, the box containing Gengen's blood-stained clothes. She felt that she had done something wrong to Gengen, and felt extremely ashamed. She looked at the box, tears streaming down her face.
    (Thirty-eight)
    After this, Cui Cui received several more guests. When Gui Cai found out, he looked for Cui Cui several times. Cui Cui tried to commit suicide by hanging herself to avoid him. Gui Cai became angry and had his henchmen spread rumors about Cui Cui all over the village. At this time, Cui Cui was no longer in control of her own fate. Previously, she had only received passing travelers as guests; soon, some young people from the village also started to visit.
    (Thirty-nine)
    The following autumn, the Japanese devils invaded. Liu Gui Cai welcomed the Japanese devils into his home, waving the Rising Sun flag. Relying on the enemy's power, he began to show off his authority to the villagers again.
    (Forty)
    A bunker was built in front of Diantou Village, and the enemy demanded young girls from the village. At that time, Gui Cai was the village head, and he forced Cui Cui to be sent to the bunker. Jinbao was left in the care of the blind grandmother.

    金宝娘
    邢琏画
    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （三十七）
    娘已抱着金宝睡着了。翠翠见了娘，脸不由的红了，心里说不出的难受。她看看地下的烂箱子，箱子里藏着根元的血衣。她觉得她作了一件对不起根元的事，而感到极大的羞辱，看看箱子，呆呆地流泪。
    （三十八）
    这以后，翠翠又接了几回客人。贵财知道了，找了翠翠几次。翠翠寻死上吊不接待他。贵财火了，就使狗腿子们在村里到处给翠翠传名。这时翠翠便身不由己了，先前只是接过往的外路客人；不久本村一些青年人也来往上了。
    （三十九）
    第二年秋天，日本鬼子打进来了。刘贵财打着膏药旗把日本鬼子接到家里。仗着敌人的势力，他又向村里人显威风起来。
    （四十）
    店头村前边安了个碉堡，敌人向村里要花姑娘。那时，贵财当村长，他逼着把翠翠送上了碉堡。金宝留给了瞎奶奶照管。
