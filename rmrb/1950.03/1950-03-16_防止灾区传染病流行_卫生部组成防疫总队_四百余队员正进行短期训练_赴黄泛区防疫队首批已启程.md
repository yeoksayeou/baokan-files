　　To prevent infectious disease outbreaks in disaster areas, the Ministry of Health has formed an anti-epidemic task force of over 400 people. The plan is to provide them with short-term political and professional training, and then send them to work in the disaster areas. The training class held its opening ceremony at 1:00 PM on the 13th. Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai, Vice Minister of Health He Cheng, and others attended. At the meeting, Minister Xie delivered a report on the disaster relief work. He pointed out that today's disaster relief work is a mission to reverse history. In Chinese history, there have always been years of famine after every war, and this disaster was unavoidable and very serious. However, today is different. The People's Government has the power to reverse this historical precedent, and has already reversed most of it. Minister Xie gave a detailed report on the disaster situation in various places and the government's disaster relief measures, and called on the anti-epidemic task force to gloriously complete the historical task of fighting disease. Subsequently, Vice Minister He Cheng introduced many past experiences in overcoming difficulties in health work. He pointed out that the conditions for today's anti-epidemic work are much better than in the past, and that there is experience from anti-epidemic work in the Northeast and North China, so there should be full confidence in engaging in this work. The meeting proceeded in a serious and joyful atmosphere.
