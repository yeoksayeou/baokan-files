Normal University Communist Youth League Committee Established; Membership Reaches Over 300

[This newspaper's report] The work of the Communist Youth League at Normal University has rapidly developed in the past six months. At the beginning of last semester, there were only 196 members. By the end of February this year, it had grown to 365 members, with an additional 23 Youth League friends. To adapt to objective needs, the school's Communist Youth League General Branch Committee has been expanded into a League Committee, with three General Branch Committees established according to the original departments of Liberal Arts, Science, and Education. On the 11th of this month, a general meeting of all League members was held, reporting on the work summary of the past six months and electing the League Committee and General Branch Committee members. In the discussion of Normal University's reform and reviewing lessons, the Communist Youth League, in coordination with the administration, initially corrected the ideological confusion. The vast majority of League members have initially established a worldview of serving the people. The academic performance of League members has also generally improved. For example, the overall average grade of League members in the second grade of the Nursery Department has increased from 78 points to 87 points. Others, such as League members serving in the Student Union, half-day schools, and night schools, have all demonstrated enthusiasm in their work and have overcome difficulties. Due to the good performance of League members in their studies and work, the relationship between the League and the masses has also improved significantly compared to the past. After reviewing and correcting the errors of closed-doorism within the League, a large number of students actively requested to join the League, strengthening the League's ranks.

　　师大团委会成立  团员已达三百余
    【本报讯】半年来师大青年团的工作迅速开展。上学期开始时，只有团员一百九十六人。到本年二月底已发展至三百六十五人。另有团友二十三人。为了适应客观的需要，该校团总支委员会已扩大为团委会，按原来文、理、教三院，成立三个总支委员会。并于本月十一日召开了全体团员大会，报告了半年的工作总结，选举了团委和各总支委员。在讨论师大改革和温课当中，青年团配合行政，初步地纠正了思想上的混乱状态。绝大多数团员，初步建立了为人民服务的人生观。团员们的学习成绩也普遍的提高了。例如保育系二年级的团员的各科总平均成绩，已由七十八分提高到八十七分。其他如在学生会、半日学校及夜校服务的团员们，在工作当中表现都很积极，并且克服了工作上的困难。由于团员在学习上工作上良好的表现，团群关系也较过去改善了许多。当检讨出团内关门主义的错误后，有大批的同学，积极要求入团，壮大了团的队伍。      （师大通讯组）
