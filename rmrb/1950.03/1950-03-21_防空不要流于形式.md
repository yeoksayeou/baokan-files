　　Prevent Air Defense from Becoming a Mere Formality
    In order to prevent the air defense work of our people's capital from becoming a mere formality, I offer the following suggestions:
    I. The government should regularly inspect air defense and fire prevention equipment. If any equipment is found to be substandard, its owners should be ordered to complete the minimum necessary equipment, taking into consideration their living conditions.
    II. The capacity of air raid shelters must be sufficient to accommodate the number of people in the relevant government office, school, factory, shop, and residence. For example, if a factory has 50 employees, its air raid shelter should not only accommodate 20 people. In addition, air raid shelters must be covered. Otherwise, after rain and when the weather clears, if enemy planes attack, the air raid shelter will be full of rainwater, causing great difficulty. Furthermore, after a bomb explodes, there is a blast wave. If the distance is very close, even if one is hiding in an air raid shelter, the ears and eyes are easily injured. A cover can prevent this.

　　防空不要流于形式
    为了不使我们人民首都的防空工作流于形式起见，我提出几点意见：
    一、政府应定期检查防空设备及防火设备，发现不合格者，斟酌其生活状况，令其完成最低限度的必要设备。
    二、防空壕的设备必须能容下该机关学校工厂商店以及住户的人数为度，例如某一工厂的职工为五十人，而该工厂的防空壕仅能容二十人。另外防空壕上必须加盖，否则雨后天晴，如敌机来袭，恰是防空壕内雨水已满，殊为困难。并且炸弹爆炸后有一种暴风，如距离很近，虽躲在防空壕内耳目亦易受伤，加盖即可防止。
