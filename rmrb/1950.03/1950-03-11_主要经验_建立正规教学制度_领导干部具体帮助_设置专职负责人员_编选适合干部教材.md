　　Main Experience
    Establishing a Formal Teaching System, Leadership Cadres Providing Specific Assistance, Setting up Dedicated Personnel, Compiling Suitable Teaching Materials for Cadres
    The main experiences of various places in running spare-time schools in the past year are as follows: (1) Because the nature of spare-time schools is different from that of general schools, they must be run as formally as possible. There must be a clear teaching policy to complete a certain teaching plan within a certain period, and regulations on the school system, courses, examinations, promotion, demotion, and graduation should be formulated so that students have a certain goal and have the confidence to achieve the purpose of improving their cultural level within a certain period. (2) The importance attached to and specific assistance provided by leading cadres of various agencies is also the key to running spare-time schools well. Responsible cadres of agencies should not only actively assist in preparing for schools and mobilize cadres to actively enroll, but also provide various conveniences in their work, closely cooperate with schools, examine the learning situation and difficulties of cadres, and regard promoting and assisting the work of spare-time schools as one of the regular leadership tasks. (3) Spare-time schools must have dedicated personnel in charge to ensure the regularization of teaching. Spare-time schools in Tangshan, Baoding, and other places have full-time deans of academic affairs or principals, which plays a significant role in grasping teaching plans and regularly solving all school problems. (4) The curriculum and teaching of spare-time schools must be suitable for the work experience of cadres. Some textbooks for general elementary schools are not entirely applicable and must be compiled separately.

    建立正规教学制度  领导干部具体帮助  设置专职负责人员  编选适合干部教材
    一年来各地开办业余学校的主要经验有如下几点：（一）由于业余学校性质与一般学校不同，因此必须尽可能地办到正规化，要有明确的教学方针，在一定时期内完成一定的教学计划；并规定学制、课程、考试、升降级、毕业升学等制度，使学员有一定的目标，有信心在一定期间内达到提高文化的目的。（二）各机关领导干部的重视与具体帮助，也是办好业余学校的关键。机关负责干部不仅要主动地协助筹办学校，动员干部积极入学，并应在工作上给以种种方便，与学校密切配合，考察干部学习情况与困难问题，把推动和帮助业余学校的工作，作为经常领导任务之一。（三）业余学校必须有专人负责，以保证教学的正规化。唐山、保定等地业余学校，都设有专职的教务主任或校长，对掌握教学计划和经常解决学校的一切问题有很大作用。（四）业余学校的课程与教学，必须适合干部的工作经验，一般小学的教材有些不尽适用，必须另行编选。
