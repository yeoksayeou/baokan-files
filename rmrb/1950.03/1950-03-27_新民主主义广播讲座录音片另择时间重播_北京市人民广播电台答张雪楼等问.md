To Comrades Zhang Xuelou and Ning Lin:

Thank you for your concern and suggestions regarding broadcasting work. Regarding the questions you raised, this station answers them separately as follows:

I. The broadcast lecture series on the study of *On New Democracy* was established by the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government to cooperate with universities in Beijing and Tianjin in studying *On New Democracy* this semester. The main content is to answer questions that arise during the study in various schools. The date and time were decided by the Ministry of Education in consultation with the administrative heads of various schools based on the political study plan of each university for this semester, and it is now difficult to change. In order to facilitate other listeners to listen, this station has already rebroadcast the recording of the report by Vice Minister Qian Junrui of the Ministry of Education on March 18th at 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM on March 21st and 22nd. In the future, recordings of each report will be rebroadcast at another time.

II. Regarding the issue of installing loudspeakers in public places in the city, the service station of this station is currently planning. After selecting a suitable location, it will be realized as soon as possible. The service station was established not long ago, and experience is still lacking, and various systems are not yet perfect. In the future, we will strive to strengthen our work. The task of the service station is to find ways to solve the technical difficulties of listeners in this city in receiving broadcasts. Listeners from all walks of life can contact the service station at any time. The address of the service station is 74 Wangfujing Street. Telephone 5-5055, 5-5577.

　　新民主主义广播讲座录音片另择时间重播
    北京市人民广播电台答张雪楼等问张雪楼、宁琳二位同志：
    感谢你们对广播工作的关心和建议。关于你们提出的问题，本台分别答复如下：
    一、新民主主义论学习广播讲座，是中央人民政府教育部高等教育司为配合京津两地各大学在本学期内学习新民主主义论而设的。主要内容是解答各校学习中发生的问题。日期及时间是教育部根据各大学本学期政治学习计划召集各校行政负责人讨论决定的，现在很难更改。本台为了便利其他听众收听，已将三月十八日教育部钱俊瑞副部长报告的录音在本月二十一、二十二日两天中午一时至一时四十五分重复播送。今后每次报告的录音都将另择时间重播。
    二、关于在市内各公共场所装设扩音器问题，本台服务站正在筹划中。选妥适中地点后，当早日实现。服务站成立时间不久，经验还很缺乏，各种制度未臻完善，今后当努力加强工作。服务站的工作任务，就是设法解决本市听众收听广播的技术困难。各界听众可随时与服务站接洽。服务站地址在王府大街七十四号。电话五·五○五五，五·五五七七。
