Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th: *Pravda* published a lengthy article by Viktorov entitled "Acheson's 'Total Diplomacy' Serves Aggressive Policies."

Viktorov points out that recently, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has been making speeches almost incessantly. The author explains this clamorous behavior with the following facts: the aggressive and adventurous policies of the United States, aimed at launching a new war, have greatly alerted the broad masses of the American people; the past and present failures of American diplomacy have aroused growing dissatisfaction in some of the highest ruling circles. The author details Acheson's speech on March 16th, which discussed the evolution of Soviet-American relations. Acheson delivered this speech in Berkeley, California, and gave it the title "American-Soviet Friction."

Viktorov writes that Acheson's speech, particularly his "Total Diplomacy," intended to replace the absolutely weak and impotent "atomic diplomacy," demonstrates that the harsh lessons of life have not influenced the leaders of American foreign policy. Acheson's adoption of the tactic of blaming others in an attempt to evade responsibility for the international tense atmosphere is clearly inappropriate, and therefore it is not surprising that all such attempts have met with miserable failure.

Acheson's speech clearly shows that the "Total Diplomacy" he announced not only signifies the continuation of the aggressive course of American foreign policy, but even the intensification of this course. Acheson said: "Whether we can achieve our goals cannot be determined solely by our desire to seek peace, but must be supported by strength." From these words alone, it can be seen how much his hypocritical talk about the U.S.'s willingness to participate in sincere efforts aimed at seeking peaceful solutions is worth.

In Acheson's speech, there is a section that discusses several issues that he believes reflect the most important differences between the United States and the Soviet Union.

In this section, the unwillingness of the American ruling circles to resolve outstanding international issues is particularly evident.

The first issue concerns the formulation of treaty terms with Germany, Austria, and Japan. Everyone knows that the reason there is no peace treaty with Germany now is due to the policies of the United States and other Western European countries. They are brutally violating the Potsdam Agreement and continuing to implement policies aimed at dismembering West Germany. Based on their plan to turn West Germany into an anti-Soviet springboard, the United States and Western countries are not concluding a peace treaty, but are forcing West Germany to accept the Bonn puppet "government," the Ruhr Statute, and occupation statutes, attempting to perpetuate the occupation regime and ensure the long-term presence of occupation forces in the West German region.

When talking about the peace treaty with Japan, Acheson tried to portray the obstruction of the treaty's conclusion as being due to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to recognize the interests of countries that are not members of the Council of Foreign Ministers. This kind of statement is nothing but a brazen lie.

The second issue Acheson discussed was the use of force in international relations. Even here, Acheson revealed his true colors. In order to divert people's attention from the United States' use of power politics in international relations and the United States' arrogant interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Acheson slandered the Soviet Union, insisting that the Soviet Union violated the Yalta Agreement.

If we are to talk about the use of force, American policy is full of such examples, and it daily brutally interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, forcing them to accept the will of the United States, rendering the national sovereignty and economic independence of the countries under the "Marshall Plan" non-existent.

The third issue concerns policy towards the United Nations. The "crime" that Acheson added to the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union follows a "policy of obstruction" in the United Nations, backfired on Acheson himself, because the policy of obstruction is precisely the characteristic of Acheson's policy.

The next section of Acheson's speech is titled "Attempts to Undermine Existing Governments." In this section, Acheson dug out the lie about the Soviet Union "exporting revolution" from the moth-eaten pile of anti-Soviet slander. Needless to say, Acheson did not offer reasons or evidence to confirm this provocative fabrication, because such reasons simply do not exist. The lies he dragged out have long been exposed beyond doubt.

Viktorov pointed out that it is not difficult to guess the meaning and purpose of Acheson's defamatory statement. He wants to find some excuses to justify the policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

In one of his recent speeches, Mr. Acheson declared that the diplomatic goals of the United States cannot be achieved through agreements, and therefore he concluded that strength is essential to achieve the goals pursued by American policy. This is the main guideline of Acheson's foreign policy.

Everything Acheson said proves the same thing: he has no concrete proposals aimed at supporting and consolidating peace. This explains why Acheson continuously praises "Total Diplomacy." "Total Diplomacy" is actually no different from "Atomic Diplomacy," that is, diplomacy based on pure strength and the use of pressure, intimidation, and threats. But it is well known that the policy of pressure and threats is not applicable to the Soviet Union and many other countries that can defend their national sovereignty and independence.

Viktorov wrote in conclusion: In contrast to this foreign policy, the Soviet Union pursues a consistent policy of peace. The Soviet government puts forward proposals every year aimed at supporting and consolidating peace and ensuring the security of all countries and universal peace. This policy of the Soviet Union is supported by millions of people in all countries around the world because it is in line with the vital interests of all peace-loving countries and the interests of all mankind.

### 艾奇逊的“总体外交”服务于侵略政策  真理报载维克托罗夫论文

　　艾奇逊的“总体外交”服务于侵略政策
    真理报载维克托罗夫论文
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报刊载维克托罗夫所撰长文，题为《艾奇逊的“总体外交”服务于侵略政策。》
    维克托罗夫指出，近来，美国国务卿艾奇逊几乎是不断地发表演说。作者以下列事实说明这一叫嚣行动：美国的旨在发动新战争的侵略性冒险政策，已使美国广大人民大大警觉；美国外交过去和现在的失败已经在某些最高级统治集团中引起日益增长的不满。论文作者详叙艾奇逊在三月十六日发表的专论苏美关系的演说。艾奇逊在加利福尼亚州的巴克莱发表这篇演说，并给它加上一个《美苏磨擦》的题目。
    维克托罗夫写道，艾奇逊的演说，特别显然是打算用来代替绝对虚弱无力的“原子外交”的“总体外交”，说明生活的严酷的教训对美国外交政策的领袖并没有发生影响。艾奇逊采取归罪于人的手法，企图推脱国际紧张气氛的责任，是显然不适当的，因此这一切企图全都遭到惨败，是不足为奇的。
    艾奇逊的演说清楚地表明：他所宣布的“总体外交”，不但意味着美国外交政策的侵略方针的继续，而且甚至意味着这一方针的强化。艾奇逊说：“我们是否能达到我们的目的是我们争取和平的愿望所无法单独决定的，而必须以实力来支持”，由他自己这句话就可以看出，他所说的美国准备参加旨在寻求和平解决的诚意努力的假惺惺的话，能值几个钱。
    在艾奇逊的演说中有一部分谈及他认为反映了美苏之间最重要的分歧的几个问题。
    在这一部分中，美国统治集团之不愿解决国际未决问题显得特别明显。
    第一个问题是关于厘定对德奥日三国的和约条款。大家知道现在所以还没有对德和约，是由于美国和其他西欧国家的政策。它们粗暴地破坏波茨坦协定，并且继续执行旨在肢解西德的政策。美国和西方国家依据它们的把西德变成反苏跳板的计划，不是缔结和约，而是强迫西德接受波恩傀儡“政府”，鲁尔法规和占领法规，图使占领政权长时存在下去，并保证占领军长期在西德地区驻扎。
    在谈到对日和约时，艾奇逊力图把事情说成是和约缔结之受到阻挠，是由于苏联不愿承认和约与非外长会议会员国国家的利害关系。这一类说法不过是厚颜的谎言。
    艾奇逊谈论的第二个问题是关于在国际关系上武力之使用。甚至在这里，艾奇逊也显出了原形。艾奇逊为了转移人们对美国在国际关系上使用强权政治和美国强横干涉其他国家内政的注意力，就诽谤苏联，硬说苏联违犯雅尔塔协定。
    如果我们要谈及使用武力的话，美国的政策充满了这样的例子，并且天天凶横干涉其他国家的内政，强迫他国接受美国的意旨，使“马歇尔计划”的国家的国家主权与经济独立荡然无存。
    第三个问题是关于对联合国的政策。艾奇逊加在苏联身上的，说苏联在联合国中遵循着“阻挠政策”的“罪名”，反过来打了艾奇逊自己一记耳光，因为阻挠政策正是艾奇逊的政策的特色。
    艾奇逊演说的下一段题名“企图破坏现存政府”。在这一段里，艾奇逊从虫蛀了的反苏诽谤废纸堆中掘出了关于苏联“输出革命”的谎言。不用说，艾奇逊没有举出理由也没有举出证据来证实这个挑拨性的捏造，因为这样的理由是根本不存在的。他所拖出来的谎言早就被揭露无遗了。
    维克托罗夫指出：不难猜出艾奇逊的诽谤声明的意义和目的。他想找一些遁辞来辩护干涉其他国家内政的政策。
    艾奇逊先生在他最近几篇演说的一篇中宣称：美国的外交目的无法通过协议而达到，因此就认定：为要达到美国政策所追求的目的，实力是必不可或缺的。这就是艾奇逊外交政策的主要方针。
    艾奇逊所说的一切，都证明同样一件事：他没有任何以支持和巩固和平为目的的具体建议。这就说明为什么艾奇逊连续不断地赞颂“总体外交”。“总体外交”实际上是与“原子外交”毫无不同的，也就是凭借单纯的实力与使用压力、恫吓手段及威胁手段的外交。但众所周知：压力与威胁的政策对于苏联和许多其他能够保卫其国家主权与独立的国家是不适用的。
    维克托罗夫在结语时写道：和这种外交政策相反，苏联实行着一贯的和平政策。苏维埃政府每年都提出旨在支持和巩固和平并能确保各国安全与普遍和平的建议。苏联的这种政策得到全世界一切国家千百万人民的支持，因为它符合各爱好和平国家的切身利益和整个人类的利益。
