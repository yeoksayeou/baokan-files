Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has recently received reports of infectious diseases occurring in various regions. It has dispatched epidemic prevention personnel and allocated epidemic prevention drugs to carry out prevention and control, investigation, and publicity work. In January, plague occurred in Lianjiang, Suixi, and other areas of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province. In addition to rushing 1 million doses of plague vaccine to the area, the Ministry of Health also dispatched 154 personnel from the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Team, carrying a large number of drugs, equipment, and propaganda materials to the epidemic area to assist in prevention and control. Plague also occurred in six counties, including Yan Hai, Fuqing, and Putian in Fujian Province, and Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province, during the same period. In the plague-stricken areas of Fujian Province, the personnel of the "Southeast Plague Prevention Office," which was taken over by the Provincial People's Government, were carrying out prevention and control work, and the Ministry of Health dispatched Samula, the captain of the Inner Mongolia Epidemic Prevention Team, and others to assist. In Zhejiang Province, in addition to the five brigades of the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters taken over by the Provincial People's Government that had been dispatched to the Wenzhou epidemic area, the Ministry of Health also dispatched a portion of the epidemic prevention staff from the Shanghai Quarantine Station to assist, and also transported a batch of plague vaccine. In addition, in order to prevent the recurrence of plague in Chahar and Inner Mongolia, the Ministry of Health began preparing to establish the Chahar-Mongolia Plague Prevention Institute last month in order to regularly carry out rat extermination, flea extermination, preventive injections, and investigation and research.

　　Many areas have recently discovered smallpox. Epidemics have occurred in Xinjiang's Dihua, southern Sichuan Province, Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, Gaoping in Shanxi Province, Runan in Henan Province, the Central and Southern Shandong District, Wuhu in southern Anhui, Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, Shantou in Guangdong, as well as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other cities, and parts of Northeast China. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has successively allocated approximately 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine to various regions, which can be used to vaccinate nearly 20 million people, and has also issued instructions on prevention and control methods.

　　In addition to plague and smallpox, acute epidemics have occurred in Xiangyang and Zaoyang in Hubei Province, and epidemic meningitis and diphtheria have also been found in Xinyang, Luoyang, and Shanxian in Henan Province, and typhus has also been found in Central and Southern Shandong and Inner Mongolia. The Ministry of Health has dispatched medical personnel and allocated drugs to assist in prevention and control in various regions. In order to strengthen epidemic prevention forces, the Ministry of Health has ordered a large number of serums and vaccines from the Dalian Health Research Institute and the Beijing Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Office, and plans to establish a Kala-azar Prevention Institute within half a year, stationed in the Kala-azar epidemic areas on both sides of the Yellow River. In areas where typhus and relapsing fever are prevalent, mobile flea extermination teams will be organized to carry out regular prevention and treatment work. The Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters under the Ministry will expand its organization to assist local health authorities in carrying out general health work during normal times, and will serve as a mobile force for prevention and control when epidemics occur.

    派遣医务人员调拨防疫药品   
    大力协助各地防治疫病
    【新华社北京三日电】中央人民政府卫生部最近接获各地发生传染病的报告，都已分别派出防疫人员和拨运防疫药品前往进行防治和调查宣传工作。一月份，广东省雷州半岛的濂江、遂溪等地发生鼠疫，卫生部除赶运鼠疫生菌苗一百万人份前往供用外，并调派东北防疫队人员一百五十四人携带大批药品、器材和宣传品赶赴疫区协助防治。福建省延海、福清、莆田等六县和浙江省温州市也在同时期内先后发生鼠疫。福建省发生鼠疫地带系由该省人民政府接管的“东南鼠疫防治处”人员在进行防治工作，并由卫生部调派内蒙防疫队长萨木拉等人前往协助。浙江省除省人民政府接管的防疫总队五个大队已派往温州疫区工作外，卫生部并调派上海检疫所一部分防疫工作人员前往协助，同时还运去鼠疫生菌苗一批。此外，为了预防察北、内蒙的鼠疫再起，卫生部已于上月开始筹备建立察蒙鼠疫防治所，以便经常地进行捕鼠灭蚤、预防注射和调查研究等工作。
    各地最近发现天花的地区很多。新疆的迪化、四川省南部、河北的石家庄等地、山西的高平、河南的汝南、山东的鲁中南区、皖南的芜湖、江西的南昌、广东的汕头以及京、津、宁、沪、武汉等市和东北部分地区，均有疫情。中央人民政府卫生部已先后拨发各地牛痘苗共约三十万打，可供近二千万人接种牛痘之用，同时并分别指示了防治方法。
    除鼠疫、天花之外、湖北襄阳、枣阳一带曾发生急性流行病，河南信阳、洛阳、陕县等地也曾经发现流行性脑膜炎和白喉，鲁中南和内蒙也发现斑疹伤寒。卫生部已分别派遣医务人员和调拨药品协助各地防治。为了充实防疫力量，卫生部已在大连卫生研究所和北京天坛防疫处订制了大批血清和疫苗，并计划在半年内筹建黑热病防治所，分驻黄河两岸黑热病流行地区。在斑疹伤寒和回归热流行地带，则将组织巡回灭蚤队，经常进行预防与治疗工作。该部所辖中央防疫总队将扩大组织，平时协助地方卫生机关进行一般的卫生工作，疫病发生时即作为机动力量进行防治。
