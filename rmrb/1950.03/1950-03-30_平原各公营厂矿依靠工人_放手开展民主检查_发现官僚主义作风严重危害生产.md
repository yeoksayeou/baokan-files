　　Plains Public Factories and Mines Rely on Workers
    Boldly Carry Out Democratic Inspection
    Discovering Bureaucratic Work Style Seriously Endangering Production
    [Our Newspaper News] Special Correspondent Mao × reports: In the democratic inspection movement in the factories and mines under the Pingyuan Provincial Industrial Corporation, some factories clarified the idea of relying on the working class, accepted workers' rationalization proposals, and absorbed workers to participate in factory management, so they were able to be creative in production and work, and smoothly complete or even exceed the plan; conversely, some factory and mine leaders did not rely on mobilizing workers to complete production tasks, and were busy with administrative work all day long, neither studying production management nor caring about workers' welfare, so production could not be improved, costs could not be reduced, and tasks could not be completed. The former, such as the Xinxiang Oil Mill, due to the absorption of five technicians including Yang Lianfeng and Ren Jingsheng to participate in the factory management committee, and acceptance of workers' opinions, changed the tooth-moving mechanism on the cotton hulling machine in January, so that the hulled cotton skin did not carry raw materials. Therefore, the oil production in January reached 59,024.5 jin, and the average oil production rate increased to 12.14%. In February, after research, a steaming pot was added to fully cook the oil. As a result of the technological improvement, the average oil production rate for the entire month continued to increase to 14.375%, exceeding the original plan requirement of 13.75%, and the production efficiency increased by 41.82% compared with January. The cost per jin of oil was reduced by 5.5 liang of millet, and the total cost reduction for the month was equivalent to 20,809 jin of millet. In the inspection of the Tongfeng Flour Mill, workers put forward 141 constructive opinions, established a workers' representative meeting and a factory management committee, and summarized the work since the resumption of work through democratic appraisal of models. The enthusiasm of workers for production has been greatly improved. Workers transformed the bran cart, changing the 24-eye wire cloth to 32-eye, replaced the bran brush, and reduced the weight of the No. 34 round sieve, and clarified the flour path. As a result, the cost decreased month by month, and the flour yield increased from 72% to 79-80%, with a maximum of 81%; the hourly output increased from 80 bags to 120 bags, an increase of 50%; the processing cost per 100 jin of wheat decreased from 6.06 jin of wheat to 4.78 jin. Although the factory has not yet reached the original planned quota requirements, because it has inspired the enthusiasm of workers for production, both the output and quality have been significantly improved. The Pingyuan Machinery Factory has improved the efficiency of the baking furnace by 124% compared with the previous one, and the efficiency of the water pipe production in the sand casting department has increased by 24% compared with the previous one, due to the readjustment of labor organization and the reduction of labor waste and loss. Therefore, the baking furnace completed the production task in February three days ahead of schedule, and other departments have completed the plan on time. For example, after the Xin Zhuang Coal Mine's factory management committee accepted workers' opinions and implemented a three-shift work system, the total coal production in January and February was 13,717 tons, exceeding the original plan of 10,000 tons by 37.17%. After the Duli Coal Mine changed to three-shift production, the cost per ton of coal was reduced by 3 jin of millet.
    As for the Anyang Match Factory, due to serious bureaucracy in the leadership, the manager's office was busy with administrative work all day long, relaxing production management, and not paying attention to workers' hygiene, resulting in a monthly increase in the number of sick workers. According to statistics for 20 days in February, the number of sick workers reached 206, accounting for 5% of the total number of workers in the factory, and an average of more than 10 workers took sick leave every day. Although the factory completed the plan in terms of quantity in January and February, the production efficiency and cost were far from the requirements, and the waste of materials was also very serious. The average labor productivity of the factory in January was 0.415 boxes, and it fell to 0.375 boxes in February; the cost per box in January was equivalent to 161 jin of millet, that is, each box of matches lost 11 jin of rice, and although it decreased to 149 jin in February, each box of matches still lost 7 jin of rice. Before the Xiaoxitian Coal Mine implemented piece-rate wages, it lacked precise investigation and research on the production situation, and hastily formulated excessively low production standards. It did not carry out in-depth mobilization among the workers, nor did it ask for instructions and approval from the higher authorities. As a result, the workers had concerns in their minds, fearing that they would exceed the standards, thereby limiting the improvement of production. In addition, such as the Purun Flour Mill and the Xinxiang Hydropower Plant, because the leadership style was not democratic and they did not pay attention to mobilizing workers, the production management was also very chaotic, and the production work could not be improved.

　　平原各公营厂矿依靠工人
    放手开展民主检查
    发现官僚主义作风严重危害生产
    【本报讯】特约通讯员毛×报导：平原省实业公司所属各厂矿，在民主检查运动中，有的厂明确了依靠工人阶级的思想，接受工人合理化建议，并吸收工人参加工厂管理，便能够在生产工作上有所创造，并顺利完成甚至超过计划；反之，有的厂矿领导上不依靠发动工人完成生产任务，整天忙于事务工作，既不钻研生产管理，也不关心工人福利，因此生产无法提高，成本无法减低，任务也不能完成。前者如新乡榨油厂，由于吸收了杨连奉、任景生等五个技术工人参加工厂管委会，并接受工人意见，在一月份改换了克皮机上的搬牙，使克出的棉皮不夹带原料，因而一月份产油量达五九、○二四·五斤，平均产油率提高到百分之一二·一四。二月份又经过研究增加了蒸糁锅，使油料完全蒸熟，由于改进技术的结果，全月平均产油率继续提高到百分之一四·三七五，超过原计划要求产油率一三·七五的标准，且生产效率较一月份提高了百分之四一·八二，每斤油的成本则较前减低小米五两半，全月共减低成本折小米二○、八○九斤。通丰面粉厂在检查中，工人提出建设性意见一四一条，建立了工人代表会及工厂管理委员会，并经过民主评奖模范，总结了复工以来的工作，工人生产积极性大大提高。工人改造了麸皮车，把二十四眼钢丝布，改变为三十二眼，改换了麸皮刷，并减轻三十四号圆罗重量，又把面路分清，因而成本逐月降低，制粉率由百分之七二提高为百分之七九——八○，最高达百分之八一；每小时产量则由八十袋增到一二○袋，增加百分之五十；每百斤麦加工费由六·○六斤小麦，降为四·七八斤。该厂虽尚未达原计划定额要求，但因为启发了工人生产积极性，产量质量都得到显著提高。平原机器厂因重新调整了劳力组织，减少了劳动力的浪费和损失，烘炉工作效率较前提高百分之一百二十四，翻砂部造水车管子效率比前提高百分之二十四，因而二月份生产任务，烘炉提前完成了三天，其他部门均已按时完成计划。如辛庄煤矿由于工厂管理委员会接受工人意见，实行三班工作制后，一二月份共产煤一三、七一七吨，较原计划一○、○○○吨，超过百分之三七·一七。都里煤矿改三班生产后，每吨煤成本降低小米三斤。
    至于安阳火柴厂，则由于领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，经理办公室整天忙于事务工作，放松生产管理，对工人卫生亦不加注意，致病号逐月增加。二月份二十天统计，病号竟达二○六人之多，占全厂工人百分之五，平均每天有十个以上工人因病请假。该厂一、二月份虽在数量上完成计划，但生产效率与成本均距离要求甚远，材料浪费也很严重。该厂一月份每工生产率平均为○·四一五箱，二月份又跌到○·三七五箱；一月份每箱成本合小米一六一斤，即每箱火柴赔十一斤米，二月份虽降为一四九斤，每箱火柴仍赔七斤米。小西天煤矿在实行计件工资以前，对生产情况缺乏精密的调查研究，即草率的制定了过低的生产标准，既未在工人中深入动员，又未向上级请示批准，就草率推行，结果工人思想上有顾虑，怕超过标准，因而限制了生产的提高。此外如普润面粉厂，新乡水电厂等，因为领导作风不民主，不重视发动工人，因而生产管理上也很混乱，生产工作不能提高。
