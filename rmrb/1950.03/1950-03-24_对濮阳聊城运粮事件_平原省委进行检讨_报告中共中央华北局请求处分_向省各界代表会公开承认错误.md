Regarding the mistakes in the grain transport incident that occurred in the Puyang and Liaocheng regions of Pingyuan Province last winter, the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee has submitted a report of self-criticism to the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau on the 19th of this month. The full text of the report is as follows:

The errors in the grain transport incident in Puyang, Liaocheng, and other regions of Pingyuan Province last winter were mainly the result of bureaucratic leadership on the part of our Pingyuan Provincial Committee and insufficient attention to the grain transport work. The grain transport incident in Puyang, Liaocheng, and other regions caused significant losses to the Party and the people. According to the investigation, four people died, 355 livestock died, and 59 livestock were injured or sick. This significant loss is extremely distressing.

During the autumn grain collection last year, although the Pingyuan Provincial Committee and the Pingyuan Provincial Government jointly studied and arranged the autumn grain collection methods and issued instructions, they did not pay attention to the work of grain storage and warehousing and did not discuss or arrange it at all. The Provincial Committee simply believed in its thinking that grain storage work was the business work of the Provincial Government and a purely technical work. It failed to recognize that grain storage was the most important key to completing the autumn grain collection task and failed to realize that the transition from decentralized storage in rural areas to centralized storage was a major mass movement related to 16 million people across the province. Therefore, the Provincial Committee did not care about or pay attention to this work, nor did it assist the Provincial Government in arranging this work, resulting in the grain transport work falling completely into a state of laissez-faire, causing extremely chaotic phenomena and causing undue losses to the masses.

After the Provincial Committee discovered this serious mistake, although it urged the Party Group of the Provincial Government and the Puyang and Liaocheng Prefectural Committees to examine and deal with this wrong event, it did not take a truly serious and responsible attitude to thoroughly investigate and deal with it, nor did it report it to the North China Bureau in a timely manner because it was not sufficiently aware of the seriousness of this incident. This demonstrates our serious lack of organization and discipline. It was not until the North China Bureau repeatedly urged and criticized us that we gradually realized the seriousness of this wrong incident and began to deal with it in a serious and responsible manner.

The mistakes in the Pingyuan Provincial grain transport incident have caused irreparable losses to the Party and the people. In order to correct this error, in addition to the Provincial Committee having held in-depth self-criticism meetings, publicly admitting errors to the people at the representatives' conference, and suggesting that the Provincial Government compensate the masses for their losses (which has now been done), we hereby request the North China Bureau to punish us.

　　对濮阳聊城运粮事件
    平原省委进行检讨
    报告中共中央华北局请求处分  向省各界代表会公开承认错误
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局收到了中共平原省委员会于本月十九日所作的关于去年冬季该省濮阳专区及聊城专区运粮事件错误的检讨报告一件。报告全文如下：
    去年冬季平原省濮阳、聊城等地区所发生的运粮事件错误，主要是由于我们平原省委员会领导上的官僚主义及对运粮工作重视不够的结果。濮阳、聊城等地区的运粮事件，使党和人民遭受重大损失。据清查结果，共死四人，死牲口三百五十五头，伤病牲口五十九头。这个重大损失是极堪痛心的。
    去年秋征时，虽然平原省委会与平原省政府曾共同研究和布置了秋征办法，并发了指示，但对粮食入仓工作则未注意，根本未讨论布置。省委会在思想上简单地认为粮食入仓工作是省政府的业务工作，是一个单纯的技术工作，而未认识到粮食入仓是完成秋征任务的最重要关键，未认识到由分存农村到集中入仓是关系到全省一千六百万人民的一个重大的群众性行动。因此，省委会就未关心和注意这一工作，也未协助省政府布置这一工作，以致使运粮工作完全陷于自流，产生极大的混乱现象，使群众遭到不应有的损失。
    省委会发现这一严重错误后，虽曾督促省政府党组及濮阳、聊城地委检查和处理这一错误事件，但由于我们对这一事件的严重性认识不足，故未能采取真正严肃认真的态度，予以彻底追究和处理，亦未向华北局及时报告。这表现了我们的严重的无组织无纪律现象。直至华北局一再督促批评，我们才逐渐认识这一错误事件的严重性，才开始以严肃认真的态度来处理它。
    平原省运粮事件错误，已造成了党和人民不可弥补的损失。为纠正这一错误，除省委已开会深入检查反省，在各界代表会向人民公开承认错误，并建议省政府赔偿群众损失（现已赔偿）外，特请华北局给我们处分。
