Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: A compilation of TASS Moscow dispatches: The working people of the Soviet Union are holding rallies, warmly congratulating the election of deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Workers, farmers, and intellectuals are unanimously rejoicing over the glorious victory won by the Stalin Party and Non-Party League on March 12th, and are unanimously declaring their determination to build communism with wholehearted labor.

    Hundreds of factories in Moscow held various rallies and celebrations. A female worker from a cutting tool factory, Roginova, said at the meeting: "I am a mother of two children, and my husband sacrificed himself in the Great Patriotic War. If it were in a capitalist country, we would probably have starved to death long ago, but the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government have enabled me to nurture and educate my children. My salary is high, and I live well. I know that my life will be even better in the future." Larkin, a lathe operator at the Moscow Leibsi Factory, said: "We unanimously voted in the election to support the wise policies of the Bolshevik Party. After the election, we will begin work with new achievements."

    Many factories have already completed the obligations undertaken in preparation for the election and will begin work with new achievements
    The personnel of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory have already completed the obligations undertaken in preparation for the election ahead of schedule. Recently, they saved one million kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than a thousand tons of coal, and a lot of metal and raw materials. The craftsman Kovalenko created a world record in labor productivity. Until recently, stamping 560 crankshafts per shift was considered an insurmountable record, but Kovalenko produced more than 600 crankshafts in one shift. The Dimona Manufacturing Plant has produced many machines exceeding the Five-Year Plan. Moscow's tire factory completed twice the obligations undertaken for the election. To celebrate the election, inventors at the Ilyich Factory, the largest machine industry factory in the Soviet Union, put forward more than 240 suggestions, some of which have already been implemented, saving approximately three million rubles annually.

    Leningrad workers are holding competitions for greater technical progress in industry. Workers at the Red Sormovo Factory said: "Strengthening and increasing the power of the Party and Non-Party League is the sacred responsibility of each of us." Similar reports are coming from factories and manufacturing plants in the Urals, coal mines in Karaganda and Donets, from Estonia and other regions of the Soviet Union. Soviet farmers are celebrating the victory of the Party and Non-Party League with new achievements in work. Collective farmers in Rostov's Khassak have pledged to achieve a bumper harvest of grain. Many collective farms have pledged to harvest at least 120 poods of wheat per hectare. Salimssakov, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Republic, wrote in Izvestia: These days, the people of Uzbekistan are expressing with extraordinary strength their boundless love and gratitude to the great Russian people, the elder brother in this equal and harmonious family. With their lofty and selfless help, the people of Uzbekistan have achieved unprecedented progress, and have obtained a prosperous, happy, and joyful life.

    数以百计的莫斯科工厂举行了各种集会与庆祝会，削切器制造厂女工罗吉诺娃在会上说：“我是两个孩子的母亲，丈夫已在伟大的爱国战争中牺牲了。要是在资本主义国家，我们怕早已饿得半死了，布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府却使我能够培育和教养我的孩子。我的工资很多，生活得很好。我知道将来我的生活会过得更好。”莫斯科赖卜西工厂的镟工拉尔金说：“我们在选举中全体一致投票来拥护布尔什维克党的英明政策。在选举后我们要以新的成就开始工作。”
    筹备选举时所承担的义务  许多工厂皆已先期完成将以新的成就开始工作
    莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的人员，已先期完成在筹备选举时承担的义务。在最近时期，他们节约了一百万千瓦时的电力，一千多吨煤，许多金属和原料。工匠科瓦伦柯在劳动生产率上创造了世界纪录。直到最近，每班压印五百六十个曲柄轴被认为是不可逾越的纪录，科瓦伦柯却在一班生产了六百个以上的曲柄轴。狄莫纳制造厂已生产了许多超过五年计划的机器，莫斯科的轮胎工厂完成为选举而承担的义务之两倍。为庆祝选举，苏联机器工业中最大的伊列西伊工厂的发明者提出二百四十多种建议，若干建议已经实施，每年可节省约三百万卢布。
    列宁格勒工人正为工业上更大的技术进步而举行竞赛。红色索尔莫伏工厂工人说：“加强并增大党与非党联盟的力量，是我们每一个人的神圣责任。”同样的报道正从乌拉尔的工厂与制造厂、卡拉干达和顿尼兹的煤场、从爱沙尼亚和苏联其他区域纷纷传来。苏联农民以工作上的新成就来庆祝党与非党联盟的胜利。在罗斯托夫的哈萨克集体农民已经保证要使谷物丰收。许多集体农场保证每公顷至少要收一百二十普特的小麦。塔吉克斯坦的集体农场正在为本年丰收、为乡间的进一步繁荣与文化进步而不懈地工作着。乌兹贝克共和国科学院院长撒里姆萨科夫在消息报写道：这些天来，乌兹贝克人民以非常的力量来表示他们对这个平等相处大家庭中的长兄——伟大的俄罗斯人民的无限热爱与感谢。在他们的崇高与无私的帮助下，乌兹贝克人民获得了前所未有的进步，获得了繁荣、幸福和快乐的生活。
