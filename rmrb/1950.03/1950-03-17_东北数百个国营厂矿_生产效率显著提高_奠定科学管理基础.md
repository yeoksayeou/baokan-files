Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 15th. The "Create New Production Records" movement, launched in hundreds of state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China, has greatly improved the labor productivity of these factories and mines, and has laid a solid material foundation for the establishment of scientific management. According to statistics from the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government: more than two-thirds of the factories and mines under the department have created more than 19,940 new personal and collective records in the past five months or so. The average labor productivity of these factories and mines in the three months from October to December last year increased by 13% compared with the first month of the New Record Movement (September); if compared December with June, it increased by 32.83%. That is to say, with the same amount of equipment and manpower, the New Record Movement has created about one-third more wealth for the country, thereby reducing costs and ensuring the completion of last year's production and construction plan.

　　东北数百个国营厂矿
    生产效率显著提高  奠定科学管理基础
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北数百个国营厂矿开展的创造生产新纪录运动已极大地提高了各该厂矿的劳动生产率，并且给建立科学管理打下牢靠的物质基础。据东北人民政府工业部的统计：该部所属三分之二的厂矿过去五个多月中，先后创造的各种个人的和集体的新纪录，即有一万九千九百四十余件。各该厂矿在去年十月至十二月三个月的平均劳动生产率，比新纪录运动第一个月（九月）提高了百分之十三；若以十二月与六月相比，则提高了百分之三十二点八三。这也就是说，在数量相同的设备和人力条件下，经过新纪录运动，多为国家创造了约三分之一的财富，从而减低了成本；保障了去年生产修建计划的完成。
