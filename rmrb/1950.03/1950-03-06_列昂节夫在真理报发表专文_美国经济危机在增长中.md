　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: TASS Moscow, March 4th: Leontief published an article in Pravda titled "The US Economic Crisis is Growing," stating: The United States is increasingly caught in the net of economic crisis.

　　As is well known, the economic crisis in the United States has been growing since the autumn of 1948. The results of increased post-war production in American industry, achieved at the expense of the general economic recession in other capitalist countries, mainly Western European countries, vanished in the autumn of 1948.

　　Leontief pointed out: American monopolies have subordinated the entire domestic and foreign policy of the United States to their crazy plan to seize world hegemony. The unlimited arms race and the policy of preparing for a new war have caused the US economy to develop in a deformed and one-sided manner, which inevitably leads to the increasing sharpness and destructive impact of the economic crisis. The rulers of the United States and their profit-seeking economists are doing everything possible to glorify this adventurous policy as a panacea for saving the crisis. The malignant arms race is euphemistically called compensation for government expenses. This malignant arms race diverts more and more productive forces from peaceful uses, making a further decline in people's purchasing power inevitable, and thus predetermining the special sharpness and depth of the crisis in the near future. A large part of the employed people in the United States are directly forced to serve the aggressive war preparations of US imperialism. Many sectors of American heavy industry are now mainly maintained by government military orders. In the aviation industry, three-quarters of all products are absorbed by the War Department. However, no matter how fanatical these warmongers are, their tricks still cannot block the road to economic crisis.

　　To illustrate his conclusion, Leontief cited some figures from a recent report by the United Nations Secretariat on the survey of the world economic situation. This survey report showed that the national income of the United States in 1949 decreased by 2 billion US dollars compared with the previous year. In 1949, the number of fully unemployed people almost doubled compared to the previous year, and the number of partially unemployed people increased by 111 percent. At the beginning of this year, there was a further increase in unemployment. According to figures released by the US Department of Commerce, the number of unemployed people increased by 991,000 in January alone.

　　The heinous nature of the dying capitalist system is vividly reflected in the following fact: on the one hand, millions of people are tragically destined to suffer from hunger, and on the other hand, material wealth, especially food worth billions of dollars, is deteriorating and being destroyed.

　　American monopolies are transferring the entire burden of the crisis to the shoulders of the working people, and are trying to maintain the unprecedented high level of profits they have plundered. The largest automobile monopoly, General Motors, announced on January 17 that the company's profits for 1949 reached 600 million US dollars. No enterprise company in American history has ever earned such a huge profit in one year.

　　Regardless of the rampant rule of police terror, the proletariat used its tried-and-true weapon—strikes—to attack manufacturers' attempts to plunder.

　　American monopolies hope to find a way out of the predicament in foreign adventures. American imperialists are following in the footsteps of their Hitler predecessors, creating and provoking new world wars. However, they are far from being able to save this decaying capitalist system; on the contrary, they can only make it closer to its inevitable demise.

　　Leontief emphasized in his conclusion: Against the backdrop of the decaying capitalist economy, the scene of a victorious socialist country is even more magnificent. In socialist countries, there is no such thing as an economic crisis. There, people work freely for the common good, and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people has become a law. The third reduction of prices in the Soviet Union, which vividly demonstrates the care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government for the welfare of the people, the adoption of the gold standard for the exchange rate of the ruble, and the increase in the exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies—all of these most powerfully and vividly demonstrate the extreme superiority of socialism.

    美国经济危机在增长中
    美帝正在步希特勒的后尘，制造新的世界战争，但它远不能挽救腐朽透顶的资本主义制度，只能更加接近灭亡。                  
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：列昂节夫在真理报发表题为《美国经济危机在增长中》的专文称：美国愈来愈陷入经济危机的罗网中。
    如所周知，美国的经济危机，自一九四八年秋季起便一直在增长中。美国工业以其他的资本主义国家，主要是西欧国家的普遍经济衰退为代价而达到的战后生产增加的成果，在一九四八年秋天就烟消云散了。
    列昂节夫指出：美国的垄断企业已经使美国整个的内政与外交政策从属于他们争取世界霸权的疯狂计划。无限度的军备竞赛与准备新战争的政策，使美国经济产生畸形的单方面的发展，因而就必然会有日益增长的经济危机的尖锐性和破坏影响。美国的统治者和利令智昏的经济学家们，千方百计地想把这种冒险政策当作挽救危机的万应灵丹而加以颂扬。恶性的军备竞赛被美其名为补偿政府费用。这种恶性军备竞赛使愈来愈多的生产力离开和平用途，使人民购买力的进一步下降成为不可避免，并从而预定了危机在最近将来特别尖锐与深刻的不可避免性。美国的很大部分的在业人民，被直接强迫去为美帝的侵略性的战争准备服务。很多美国重工业部门，现在主要是靠政府的军事订货维持。在航空工业中，全部出品的四分之三被陆军部吸收去。但是，不管这些战争煽动者如何热狂，而他们的诡计仍然不能堵塞走向经济危机的道路。
    为了说明他的结论，列昂节夫引证了联合国秘书处最近发表的关于世界经济情势调查报告中的一些数字。这一调查报告显示美国一九四九年度的国民收入比上年减少二十亿美元。在一九四九年，完全失业者的数目几乎比前一年增加一倍，部分失业者的数目，增加了百分之一百一十一。在本年年初，失业有进一步的增长，据美国商务部发表的数字，仅在一月份内，失业的人数即增加了九十九万一千人。
    垂死的资本主义制度的罪大恶极的性质，极生动地反映在下列事实中：一方面，千百万人民悲惨地注定挨受饥饿，另一方面，物质财富首先是价值亿万美元的食物，在败坏着和被毁坏着。
    美国垄断企业把危机的全部重担转嫁到劳苦大众的肩上，竭力保持它们所掠夺的利润的空前的高度水准。最大的汽车垄断企业通用汽车公司在一月十七日宣布：该公司一九四九年度的利润达六亿美元。在美国历史上没有任何一个企业公司在一年之中赚过这样的巨额利润。
    无产阶级不顾猖獗的警察恐怖的统治，使用了它的屡试不爽的武器——罢工，来攻击制造商的剽窃企图。
    美国垄断企业希图在对外的冒险中找到走出绝境的途径。美国帝国主义者正在步他们的希特勒前辈的后尘，制造与挑拨新的世界战争。然而，他们远不能挽救这腐朽透顶的资本主义制度，相反的，只能使它更加接近于不可避免的灭亡。
    列昂节夫在结语中着重指出：在腐朽着的资本主义经济的衬托下，胜利的社会主义国家的景象是更加壮观了。在社会主义国家里，不知道有经济危机。在那里，人民为公共利益而自由劳动，劳动人民生活水准的不断提高，已经成为规律了。生动地表明共产党和苏联政府关怀人民福利的苏联物价第三次减低，卢布兑换率改用金本位，以及卢布对外币的兑换率的提高——这一切，都最有力地与最鲜明地表现了社会主义的极端优越性。
