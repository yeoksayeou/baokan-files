To the Editor:

　　Having read the report in the People's Daily on March 13 concerning the explosion at the state-owned Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan, we are deeply saddened!

　　According to reports, the mine's safety equipment is very rudimentary, and it uses a semi-manual, semi-mechanized method of extraction. This is the evil legacy left to us by the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang for decades. It is indeed a fact that our country's finances are very difficult today. However, I suggest that we would rather practice strict economy in other areas (things that can be postponed should definitely be postponed) than pursue economy in the safety equipment of industrial and mining areas, because this is directly related to the lives of workers and the loss of large amounts of national wealth!

　　The facts mentioned in the Worker's Daily editorial "Struggle against Bureaucracy and Feudal Remnants in Mine Management" also call for the Supervisory Committee and relevant departments to send a large number of personnel to various factories and mines to investigate specific materials and take effective solutions based on the actual situation. In order to collect workers' opinions and understand the situation more widely, I suggest that worker mailboxes be generally set up in industrial and mining areas throughout the country. This will surely lead to the reflection of some real situations.

### 建议工矿区设工人信箱

　　建议工矿区设工人信箱编辑同志：
    三月十三日看到人民日报所载国营河南宜洛煤矿爆炸事件，我们甚为悲痛！
    据报道称，该矿安全设备十分简陋，且系半手工半机器的开采方法，这是国民党腐败统治几十年来的“德政”遗留给我们的恶果。我们国家今天财经十分困难确是事实。但我建议我们宁可在别的方面特别厉行节约（该缓办的事情一定要缓办），而不应在工矿的安全设备上追求节约，因为这是直接连系到工人的生命问题和大批国家财富的损失！
    工人日报发表的“和矿山管理上的官僚主义与封建残余作斗争”的社论里所说的事实，也希望监察委员会与各有关部门派大批人员到各个工厂与矿山去调查具体的材料，针对实际情况加以有效的解决。为了更广泛地搜集工人的意见及了解情况，我建议在全国各工矿区普遍设立工人信箱，这样一定可以得到一些真实情况的反映。
