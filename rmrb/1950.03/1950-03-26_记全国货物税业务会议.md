Record of the National Commodity Tax Business Conference
    By our reporter Lu Chaoqi

    The National Commodity Tax Business Conference convened by the State Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance this time has achieved great results. This is because it has reached a consensus on the interim regulations on commodity tax, and following the instructions of the Central Finance and Economics Committee and the Ministry of Finance to "unify procedures, facilitate businesses and the people, plug loopholes, and increase tax revenue," it has formulated unified procedures. However, at the beginning of the conference, the opinions of representatives from various regions still differed on many minor procedural issues. After heated debates and discussions, they finally reached a consensus. The following is a brief introduction to two important issues discussed at the conference:

  I. Under the principle of simplifying procedures, is it currently possible to abolish "goods ticket traveling with the goods"?

    This was the most hotly debated issue at the conference. Some representatives had different opinions, but the majority of comrades believed that tickets are a powerful weapon to prevent tax evasion and should be as strict as possible. If the system of goods tickets traveling with the goods is abolished, it would be impossible to prevent smuggling and tax evasion, which would not only fail to guarantee tax revenue but also fail to protect legitimate industrial and commercial operators. Finally, everyone discussed and reached a consensus that abolishing the ticket system is the future direction of progress. The Soviet Union currently does not have any ticket system. However, at present, the individual economy still accounts for a large proportion in our country, and tax evasion is difficult to eliminate before the vast majority of commodities have developed to standardization. At the same time, if the system of goods tickets traveling with the goods is abolished, although the tax bureau can reduce some manpower and material resources, it will be difficult to identify taxed and untaxed goods during inspection, which will inevitably lead to item-by-item inspection, and even unpacking item-by-item. This will only increase the trouble for taxpayers. Therefore, in the current stage, in order to guarantee tax revenue, prevent unscrupulous merchants from tax evasion, and protect legitimate industrial and commercial operators, the system of goods tickets traveling with the goods cannot be abandoned. For goods produced domestically, centrally and easily controlled, it can be considered to partially abolish goods tickets traveling with the goods nationwide. In the future, as the economy develops, the tax collection procedures can be simplified day by day. However, simplifying it in one region alone, although it facilitates the exchange of materials within the region, it increases obstacles to the exchange of materials between regions, resulting in more adverse effects. Therefore, instead of dividing by region, it should be divided by individual goods. For example, currently, cement, glass, tungsten, antimony, records, and other types of goods can be selected for a trial run without goods tickets traveling with the goods, and then gradually promoted after gaining experience.

  II. Can preferential treatment be given to cigarettes during valuation?

    Among various taxable goods, cigarettes have a higher tax rate and the largest tax base, which is more important for completing tasks. Moreover, rural cigarettes are mostly produced by the masses through manual labor. Therefore, some representatives at the conference had conflicting mentalities. Some said: "The cigarette tax is too high. If it is really implemented, the cigarettes in our province will definitely be defeated." This understanding only sees its own corner and fails to consider the issue from a comprehensive perspective. Currently, the situation of the national cigarette industry is that the production and sales of machine-made cigarettes have been greatly affected by the counterfeit and illicit production, shoddy manufacturing, fake brands, and tax evasion of manual cigarettes in various regions. Taking the Central South China region as an example, according to market conditions statistics, manual cigarettes account for about one-half, while the tax collected from manual cigarettes is less than 4% of the tax on machine-made cigarettes. Last December, due to the reverse flow of tax-evading manual cigarettes into Shanghai, machine factories in Shanghai manufactured a large number of hand-cranked cigarette machines in the autumn and winter last year, which is still flowing freely, resulting in a great threat to Shanghai's machine-made cigarettes. The production of machine-made cigarettes in Wuhan decreased by 60,000 cases in 1948 compared to 1949, because the sales were seized by tax-evading manual cigarettes. This situation not only causes significant losses in tax revenue, but also violates the principle of encouraging advanced machine production. If this situation continues, it will definitely lead to the unemployment of urban professional cigarette workers, which is much more serious than the secondary industry transition of rural manual cigarettes. Therefore, it is necessary to start from a comprehensive perspective, overcome the small difficulties in individual regions, and avoid the big difficulties nationwide.

    Another problem is that individual regions give preferential treatment to the cigarette industry during valuation in order to sell more cigarettes in their own regions, which will打击 other regions' cigarette industry. As a result, it will inevitably lead to you giving preferential treatment, and I will also give preferential treatment. The total national consumption is fixed. If the number of cigarettes sold cannot be increased, no one can sell more. On the contrary, everyone will fail to complete their tasks. Based on these circumstances, everyone overcame the regional perspective of individual comrades and the one-sided "benevolent government" perspective, and unanimously realized that the government's formulation of commodity tax conditions, listing manual cigarettes and machine-made cigarettes as the same tax rate, is completely correct. We implement the government's policy, and the government is naturally responsible. Therefore, it was resolved that the valuation of cigarettes in any region should be based on the actual price, and should not violate the policy and arbitrarily give preferential treatment. It also put forward the opinion of strengthening the management of manual cigarettes, so as not to打击 advanced machine production due to tax evasion. This opinion was endorsed and passed by all the representatives.

### 记全国货物税业务会议

　　记全国货物税业务会议
    本报记者  陆超祺
    这次中央财政部税务总局召集的全国货物税业务会议，由于对货物税暂行条例，有了一致的认识，并遵照着中央财委会、财政部“统一手续，便利商民，堵塞漏洞，增加税收”的指示，拟订了统一的手续法。所以这次会议是有很大收获的。但在会议开始时，各地代表的意见，在许多细琐的手续问题上还保有一些距离，但经过热烈争论研讨后，终于取得了一致的意见，兹将会议上两个重要问题简单介绍于下：
  一、在简化手续的原则下，目前是否可废除“货票同行”？
    这是在会议中争论最热烈的一个问题。有些代表曾有不同意见，但大多数同志认为票照是防止偷漏的有力武器，应该愈严密愈好。如果废除了货票同行制度，就无法防止走私漏税，这不但不能保证税收，也保护不了正当的工商业者。最后大家讨论出一致的意见，认为废除票照制度是将来进步的方向。现在苏联即没有什么票照制度。但是目前我国个体经济还占很大部分，绝大多数商品尚未发展到标准化以前，偷漏现象是很难杜绝的。同时如果废除了货票同行制度，在税局方面虽可以减少一些人力物力，但是在查验方面，对已税未税货品不易识别，必致形成了逐件查验，甚至逐件拆包查验的方式。这样对纳税人将要更增加了麻烦。所以在现阶段中，为了保证税收，防止奸商偷漏，并保护合法纳税工商业者起见，目前仍不能放弃货票同行的制度。其在国内产制集中易于控制的货物，则可考虑在全国部分地废除货照同行，以后随着经济的发展而稽征手续亦可日趋简化。但在某一地区单独加以简化，虽然在区内便利了物资交流，而对区与区间的物资交流却反而增加了阻碍，招致更不良的影响。因此不采取从地区上分，而从个别货品上分。如目前可选择水泥、玻璃、钨、锑、唱片等数种试行货票不同行，待获得经验后，再陆续推广。
  二、对卷烟在评价时是否可以照顾？
    在各种应税货物中，卷烟税率较高，税源最大，对完成任务关系亦较重要，又以农村的卷烟多系群众手工生产，因此在会议上有个别代表存在着矛盾的心理。有的说：“卷烟税太高，若真的执行，我们省的卷烟定会被打垮了。”这种认识是仅仅看到自己的角落，并未能由全面来考虑问题。目前全国卷烟工业的情况，由于各地手工卷烟冒牌私制、滥造、假花、偷税，大大影响了机制卷烟工业的产销。以华中南区来说，按市面情形统计，手工卷烟约占二分之一，而收到的手工卷烟税，还不及机制卷烟税的百分之四。上海去年十二月份由于偷税的手工卷烟向上海倒流，去年秋冬上海机器工厂，大量制造手摇烟机，尚在自流，结果上海机制遭受很大威胁。武汉市的机制卷烟在四八年比四九年减产了六万箱，原因是销路被偷税的手工烟夺去了。这种情形不仅在税收上有重大的损失，并且也不合奖励进步机器生产的原则。这种情况，若任其继续下去，定会引起城市职业卷烟工人的失业，那就比农村手工卷烟的副业转业更严重得多了。因此必须从全面出发，克服个别地区的小困难，避免全国的大困难。
    另一个问题，是个别地区，为了使本区烟多销，就对卷烟业在评价时给以照顾，那就会打击了其他区域的卷烟工业，结果必致你也照顾，我也照顾。整个全国的消费量是固定的，如果销烟数增加不了，谁也多销不了。相反的，大家都完不成任务。大家根据这些情况，克服了个别同志的地区观点及片面的“仁政”观点，一致认识到政府制定货物税条件，将手工卷烟和机制卷烟列为同一税率，是完全正确的。我们贯彻执行政府的政策，自然由政府负责。因此决议任何地区对卷烟评价均应按实际价格评定，不能违反了政策，任意加以照顾。并提出了对手工卷烟加强管理的意见，不使其因偷税而打击了进步的机器生产。这个意见，为全体代表拥护通过了。
