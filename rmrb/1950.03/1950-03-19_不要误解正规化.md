　　Do Not Misunderstand Regularization
　　Wang Kejin
　　In the situation of nationwide victory, the transition from rural areas to cities and the need to undertake new construction in all work aspects, requires all departments to move onto a unified track. Therefore, the issue of overcoming guerrilla-style work methods and establishing regularized work systems is put before every comrade. However, what is regularization? Some comrades do not fully understand its specific content, leading to the following deviations in implementation:

　　First, in the public enterprises and organizations that have been taken over, there has been insufficient criticism of the old work systems. It is believed that they constitute scientific regularization, and they are fully retained, resulting in low work efficiency and complicated procedures, becoming a stumbling block to increased production. For example, a certain hospital (Editor's note: The specific hospital should be clearly identified so that it can quickly make corrections) has a staff of over 200 but can only accommodate 100 inpatients, with two and a half people caring for one patient. A single diagnosis and treatment requires too many procedures, such as a prescription needing the signatures of seven or eight staff members, including interns, formal doctors, attending physicians, directors, dispensers, pharmacists, and nurses. The staff is busy all day with complicated procedures, but the actual problems of the patients are not being addressed in a timely manner. If this is considered scientific regularization, then work efficiency cannot be improved, and the country's financial expenditure will be too high!

　　Second, some departments, in order to implement "regularization," have established some unnecessary and complicated work systems, dividing work that one person could do into several parts in the name of "scientific division of labor." To achieve "personal responsibility," the size of the organization is expanded, and redundant personnel are added, preventing the principle of streamlining from being implemented. For example, at the Taiyuan Department Store, illiterate farmers go to shop and ask the staff about the price of a certain item. The staff merely points them to the price tag. To buy one daily necessity, one must fill out a purchase order. If buying five items, one must fill out five purchase orders, then go to the cashier to pay, get a receipt, and then go to pick up the goods. Often, many people are crowded together, waiting two or three hours to get a receipt. Time is very precious to the working people in the city, so people value their labor production time and would rather pay a higher price to buy things at private stores. Therefore, private merchants often use simple procedures as a means of competing with public stores.

　　Third, some public enterprises, in order to simplify procedures, do not provide service to the working people but instead benefit speculative merchants. For example, the Shanxi Cigarette Sales Office, in order to avoid wasting work time counting bills, stipulated that they would only accept bundles of bills taken from the bank with the bank teller's stamp, and would not accept loose bills. They forgot that the working people do not have the means to withdraw money from the bank to buy cigarettes. This makes it difficult for the working people to buy cigarettes from public organs, forcing them to endure the intermediate exploitation of private merchants.

　　From the few examples cited above, it can be seen that there are problems in some departments' understanding and implementation of regularization. Regularization is for saving time, simplifying procedures, and improving efficiency. If implementing regularization increases redundant personnel, makes procedures more complicated, and lowers work efficiency, then it is not scientific. However, some of our comrades do not understand this from the essence and often fall into formalism, thinking that establishing some complicated systems, processing things through multiple procedures, and listing many kinds of forms and documents is called "regularization" and "scientific division of labor." This is a misunderstanding and a deviation.

　　不要误解正规化
    王克锦
    在全国胜利的形势下，从乡村转入城市，一切工作要进行新的建设，各部门工作都要走上统一的轨道，因此克服游击作风建立正规化工作制度的问题就提在每一个工作同志的面前。但什么是正规化？有些同志对它的具体内容不够了解，致在执行中发生以下几种偏向：
    一、接收过来的公营企业及机关中，对旧有的工作制度批判不够，认为那就是科学的正规化，全部保留下来，致工作效率提不高，手续繁复，形成提高生产的绊脚石。如某医院（编者按：究竟是那个医院，应明白指出，使得这个医院能够很快的改正。）编制二百多人，只能收容一百个住院的病号，合两个半人照顾一个病人，诊疗一次病要经过过多的手续，如从开一张处方到取回药来要经过见习医生、正式医生、主治医生、主任、调剂、司药、药剂师、护士等七八个工作人员签名，工作人员整日忙在繁杂的手续中，病人的实际问题反而得不到及时的解决。如果认为这是科学的正规化，那么工作效率是无法提高，国家的财政开支也太大啦！
    二、有的部门为了执行“正规化”，订了一些不必要的繁杂的工作制度，把一个人可以做的工作，说是为了“科学分工”，机械的分成几部分。为了“专人负责”，扩大编制，增加冗员，使精简原则不能贯彻。如太原百货公司，不识字的农民去购物，问职员某货什么价钱，职员却指给他去看牌价。买一件日用品，要开一个购货单。如果买五件，就要开五个购货单，然后再去交款处交钱，开了单据后再去取货。常常拥挤许多人，等两三个小时开不上单据。时间对城市的劳动人民是非常宝贵的，所以一般人珍贵他们的劳动生产时间，就宁愿出较高的价钱到私人商店去买东西，因此私商常以手续简便作为与公营商店的竞争手段。
    三、也有的公营企业为了手续简便，就不照顾为劳动人民服务，反使投机商人得利。如山西纸烟推销处，为了怕数票子耽误工作时间，就规定了一条：要收从银行取出来的有银行出纳盖章的成捆票子，不收零乱钞票。他们忘记了劳动人民是没力量为了购纸烟去银行提款的。这就使劳动人民不容易在公营机关买到纸烟，只得忍受私商的中间剥削。
    从上面随便举出的几个例子，可以看出在某些部门对正规化的了解和执行是有毛病的。正规化是为了节省时间、手续简便、效率提高。如果因为执行正规化增加了冗员，手续更繁复，工作效率更降低，那就不是科学的。可是我们有某些同志不从本质上去认识，往往陷于形式主义，认为定下一些繁复的制度、处理事物经过多次手续，表格单据列了许多种，就叫“正规化”，就叫“科学的分工”，这是一种误解和偏向。
