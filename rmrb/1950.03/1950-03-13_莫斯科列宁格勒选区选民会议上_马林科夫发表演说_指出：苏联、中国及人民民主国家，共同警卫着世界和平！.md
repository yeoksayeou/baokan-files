Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS dispatch of the 10th: Malenkov delivered a speech at the voters' meeting in the Moscow Leningrad electoral district on the 9th. The speech is as follows:

Comrades! The election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet will be held on March 12th. We all believe that the citizens of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will unanimously vote for the candidates of the Party and non-Party alliance. (Applause)

The Soviet people participate in the election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet with the firm belief in the correctness of the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, which aim at further developing all sectors of our national economy, gradually improving the material welfare of the working people, and ensuring peace throughout the world. (Applause)

Undoubtedly, our people will demonstrate on March 12th their close unity around their own Communist Party and Soviet government. (Applause)

It has been four years since the last election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet. During these four years, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have achieved tremendous victories in all aspects of socialist economy and culture.

The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have achieved great victories in economic and cultural aspects.

Comrade Stalin, in his speech at the voters' meeting in the Moscow Stalin electoral district on February 9, 1946, outlined the Communist Party's work plan for the near future. He said: "As you know, these plans are laid down in the new Five-Year Plan that is about to be adopted. The main task of the new Five-Year Plan is to revive our devastated areas, restore industry and agriculture to pre-war levels, and then surpass this level to a considerable extent. In addition to abolishing the rationing system in the near future, special attention will be paid to expanding the production of consumer goods, reducing the prices of all commodities to raise the living standards of the working people, and extensively organizing various scientific research institutions that can fully utilize our scientific forces."

Restoring the economy destroyed by the war was the urgent task that our Party had to solve after the victorious end of the war. We had to devote ourselves in a short time to restoring the destroyed cities, villages, factories, manufacturing plants, railways, and large-scale agricultural work.

As early as during the war, when towns and villages temporarily occupied by the enemy were liberated, work had begun to restore the areas once occupied by the German invaders. However, this work developed on a particularly large scale after the war. In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the scale of basic construction projects in the occupied areas accounted for 37 percent of all basic construction projects in the Soviet national economy. Now, the restoration of economic, cultural, and service organizations in these areas has been largely completed.

In the fourth quarter of 1949, the total industrial output in these areas reached 106 percent of the pre-war 1940 level.

By the end of 1949, the production of coal, electricity, tractors, cement, superphosphate, and other types of industry in these areas had exceeded pre-war levels.

In the devastated areas, metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building factories, coal mines, mines, power stations, and thousands of light industrial and food industrial enterprises have been restored. It is important to point out that industrial reconstruction is being carried out on the basis of modern technology and with due attention to the latest achievements in science and engineering. The restored enterprises are equipped with sophisticated and highly efficient equipment. Along with the restoration of industry in these areas, new factories and manufacturing plants are also being built on a large scale.

Great achievements have also been made in the restoration of agriculture.

In the occupied areas, the total output of grain, sugar beets, flax, sunflower seeds, potatoes, and other crops in 1949 exceeded pre-war levels. All machine and tractor stations have been restored, and many new stations have been established.

In the destroyed areas, the network of schools, higher education institutions, cultural institutions, and hospitals has been rapidly restored. The network of primary, seven-year, and secondary schools has not only been restored but has also been greatly expanded. In 1949, the number of students in higher education institutions reached 248,000, and in technical schools, it reached 407,000, which greatly exceeded the number of students in higher education institutions and technical schools in 1940.

In 1949, the number of hospital beds in these areas was 26,000 more than in 1940. The number of doctors increased by 23,000 compared to pre-war levels.

Because many towns and villages were razed to the ground by the enemy, restoring housing in the occupied areas became a huge and complex task. However, by the end of 1949, 90 percent of the housing in the towns had been restored. Since liberation, the total area of houses repaired and newly built in cities and workers' residential areas in areas affected by war disasters has exceeded 58 million square meters, and approximately 3 million houses have been repaired and newly built in rural residential areas.

Several important production sectors exceeded the Five-Year Plan targets

As a result of the completion of the plans for the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the entire Soviet national economy has greatly exceeded the pre-war 1940 level. The Soviet Union's total industrial output in 1949 exceeded the 1940 level by 41 percent. By the end of 1949, industry was producing at a level higher than that stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1950. Several important sectors of the national economy have greatly exceeded the targets of the Five-Year Plan.

The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the output of steel and rolled metal in the steel industry in 1950 should exceed the pre-war level by 35 percent. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 1949, the production of rolled metal exceeded the 1940 level by 47 percent, while the output of steel exceeded it by 37 percent. The output of non-ferrous metals has also increased significantly.

According to the Five-Year Plan, the coal output in the Donets Basin should be restored to pre-war levels and should exceed this level in 1950. In the fourth quarter of 1949, the coal output in the Donets Basin had already reached the 1940 level, while the total coal output of various coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry reached the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1950.

The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the oil output in 1949 should reach pre-war levels and should exceed this level by 14 percent in 1950. In fact, the oil output in the fourth quarter of 1949 exceeded the 1940 level by 16 percent.

In terms of electrification, the Five-Year Plan stipulates that electricity production in 1950 should increase by 70 percent compared to 1940. This goal is close to being achieved. Electricity production in 1949 exceeded the 1940 level by 62 percent.

The production of machinery and equipment has greatly increased compared to pre-war levels. In 1949, the output of tractors was nearly three times that of 1940, automobiles nearly twice, combines nearly two and a half times, metallurgical equipment four times, electric motors two and a half times, and excavators ten times. The output of steam turbines, locomotives, train cars, spinning machines, looms, and other equipment has greatly increased. Great achievements have also been made in the chemical, timber, and paper industries, in the building materials industry, and in other sectors of the national economy.

The production of consumer goods has greatly increased during the post-war Five-Year Plan period. Compared to 1945, the output in 1949 has increased by 2.7 times for woolen fabrics, 2.2 times for cotton fabrics, 2.9 times for silk fabrics, 2.1 times for linen fabrics, 4.1 times for hosiery, 2.6 times for leather shoes, more than 1.5 times for meat, 2.8 times for butter, 2.5 times for vegetable oil, 1.7 times for fish, 4.4 times for sugar, and 3 times for soap. In the past period, the working people engaged in agricultural production have also achieved significant successes.

The law of the Five-Year Plan stipulates that the main task of agriculture is to maximize the output and harvest of agricultural products on the basis of greatly improving agricultural efficiency and widely utilizing the achievements of advanced agricultural science and technology.

Overall, the Soviet Union's huge agricultural production in 1949 exceeded the pre-war 1940 level. The total grain harvest in 1949 increased to 7.6 billion poods, which exceeded the 1940 level and almost reached the production volume stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1950. The harvest of cotton, flax, sunflower seeds, and potatoes also greatly exceeded pre-war levels.

The achievements of socialist industry have made it possible to greatly improve agricultural technology equipment during the post-war Five-Year Plan period, which ensured the further improvement of the mechanization level of agricultural labor. From 1946 to 1949, the industrial sector produced more than 430,000 tractors (based on 15 horsepower per unit), 48,000 combines, and many other machines needed for agriculture.

At the end of 1948, the Party and the government adopted a plan to plant protective forests, implement pasture crop rotation, and build ponds and reservoirs to ensure bumper harvests every year in the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union. These plans are now being successfully implemented. By the end of 1949, 590,000 hectares of protective forests had been planted, and an additional 100,000 hectares of land had been prepared for planting next year.

Based on the achievements in increasing grain production, the Party and the government also stipulated the task of maximizing the development of animal husbandry for all collective farm peasants and state farm workers. This task is the central issue of the Party and the government in developing agriculture.

In April 1949, the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted a three-year plan for developing animal husbandry in collective farms and state farms from 1949 to 1951. This plan stipulates the program for developing animal husbandry in collective farms and state farms, ensures the further and massive improvement of the welfare of collective farms, and makes it possible to meet the people's increasing demand for meat, fat, milk, and dairy products, as well as the light industry's demand for wool, leather, and livestock products.

The working people engaged in agriculture are implementing the three-year plan for developing animal husbandry with great enthusiasm and have already achieved great successes. In 1949, approximately 72,000 collective farm livestock breeding stations and 48,000 collective farm chicken and duck breeding stations have been organized. In 1949, the number of livestock on collective farms increased as follows compared to 1948: 21 percent for edible and dairy cattle (including a 27 percent increase in cows), 78 percent for pigs, and 19 percent for sheep and goats. The number of chickens and ducks doubled. In 1949, the livestock in state farms belonging to the Soviet Ministry of State Farms also increased: 13 percent for edible and dairy cattle, 46 percent for pigs, and 12 percent for sheep and goats.

People's lives continue to improve

Compared to 1940, in 1949: the income of employees increased by 24 percent, the income of farmers increased by 30 percent, and the expenses of state subsidies and allowances to the people more than doubled.

The achievements that have now been made in industry and agriculture have ensured the increase in our national income and have made it possible to greatly improve the material conditions of workers, farmers, and intellectuals. In 1949, the Soviet national income, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 36 percent compared to 1940. The wages of employees have increased, and the income of farmers in collective farming, family plots, and individual economy has also increased.

In the past period, the prices of consumer goods have been reduced three times. The people benefited approximately 86 billion rubles from the first price reduction, an additional approximately 71 billion rubles from the second price reduction, and the people will benefit at least 110 billion rubles from the most recent third price reduction. As a result of the price reductions, the real wages of employees have greatly increased, and the expenses of farmers for purchasing manufactured goods have decreased.

Caring for the welfare of the people, caring for the improvement of their material and cultural level, this is the unchanging law of socialism.

Comrade Stalin said: Under the socialist Soviet national economic system, the distribution of national income is not for the purpose of enriching the exploiting classes and their large number of parasitic servants, but for the systematic improvement of the material conditions of workers and farmers and the expansion of socialist production in urban and rural areas.

In the Soviet Union, the material security of employees is not limited to wages, and the material security of farmers is not limited to agricultural income. In our country, the people also receive subsidies, social insurance fees, pensions, free medical assistance, access to sanatoriums and rest homes, free or low-cost childcare facilities, subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers, free education and facilities for improving skills, student subsidies, and other subsidies and allowances at the expense of the state. All employees have at least two weeks of paid leave paid for by the state. In 1949, the total amount of the above-mentioned subsidies and allowances obtained by the people at the expense of the state exceeded 110 billion rubles, which is almost twice as much as in 1940. On the whole, the income of employees in 1949, calculated at comparable prices per individual worker, was 24 percent higher than in 1940, while the income of farmers increased by 30 percent per individual farmer.

Our country has no unemployed people.

On the contrary, the number of employees is increasing year by year. In 1949, the number of employees increased by 15 percent compared to 1940.

During the years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, great achievements have also been made in all aspects of socialist culture. By the end of 1949, there were more than 36 million people studying in schools at all levels, technical schools, and other specialized educational institutions. The network of medical institutions has been expanded. A large number of projects are being completed in housing construction.

In accordance with the tasks stipulated by Comrade Stalin, much work has been done in building new scientific research institutions and training experts in the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan. In 1949, the number of scientific research institutions increased by half compared to 1940, while the number of scientific workers almost doubled. The training of new scientific workers has been organized on a large scale. In 1949, 1,115 scientific research institutions and higher education institutions were training scientific workers, while before the war, only 678 scientific institutions and higher education institutions were training graduate students.

The network of higher education institutions has been expanded in accordance with the needs of the national economy. The number of students in higher education institutions, including correspondence students, reached 1,128,000, exceeding the number of students before the war by 316,000.

The total number of experts who graduated from higher education institutions and technical schools in 1949 and have joined the national economy increased by 68 percent compared to 1940.

This is how the tasks stipulated by Comrade Stalin in his historically significant speech on February 9, 1946, have been completed. (Stormy applause)

The Soviet Union's great victory proves the superiority of the socialist system

The victory that our working people have gained in restoring and further developing the national economy once again vividly illustrates to the world the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. All honest people see what tremendous power and inexhaustible energy the Party of Lenin and Stalin has inspired in our people.

The ruling groups of bourgeois countries seek to conceal from the broad masses the truth about the continuous improvement of the living standards of the Soviet working class and all working people. But what can they offer to counter these well-known facts of Soviet life—like the growing development of the socialist economy that knows no economic crisis, like the complete elimination of unemployment, the continuous increase in real wages, equal pay for equal work for men and women, large-scale social insurance, free medical assistance, vacation system, and the state's care for children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers?

Because they cannot refute these indisputable facts, our enemies rely on the most clumsy fabrications and deceptions. Their nonsense about the so-called "forced labor" existing in the Soviet Union is a good example. Judging by the facts: the official representatives of the US and British governments, as well as the reactionary leading groups of the AFL, CIO, and the Supreme Council of the British TUC, actively participated in this movement. The ruling groups of the United States and Britain paid special attention to this provocative adventure. The purpose of all kinds of rumor-mongers, hired hacks, and spies is not difficult to discern. They urgently need to divert the attention of the general public from the growing crisis of the capitalist world economy, which is accompanied by a sharp decline in the living standards of the working masses, massive unemployment, and increased poverty.

Not only our Soviet people but also all honest men and women abroad know that the free, constructive, and creative labor of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals is the basis of the prosperity and development of our socialist country and the basis for the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the working people.

Under the Soviet system, workers do not work for exploiters, but for themselves, for their own class, for society. Stalin said: "Here, the worker does not feel despised, does not feel lonely. On the contrary, the working person feels himself to be a free citizen of his country, in a sense, a figure in society. Moreover, if he works well and contributes to society to the best of his ability, then he is a labor hero and enjoys glory."

Precisely because the labor of the Soviet people is free, their productivity can increase so rapidly and continuously. Greater labor productivity makes it possible to reduce the cost of industrial and agricultural production, thereby ensuring the possibility of reducing prices and gradually improving the welfare of the working people.

The socialist system of national economy is far superior to the capitalist system: its purpose is to realize an era of happiness for human life in the world as soon as possible; on the other hand, capitalism has long become a brake on the development of human society and a dying social system; the capitalist system irrationally wastes productive forces and the lives of millions of people, and is destined to condemn an increasingly large number of the masses to semi-starvation, poverty, and destruction.

At the beginning of 1950, unemployment tightly gripped about 45 million people in all capitalist countries. According to official statistics, the total number of unemployed people in the United States in January 1950 reached 4.5 million, which is 1.7 times more than in October 1948. In addition, at the end of 1949, there were 10 million semi-unemployed people in the United States, that is, people whose working hours per week were insufficient. Thus, even US official statistics admit that the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the United States has exceeded 14.5 million. However, if we take into account the revised numbers of official unemployment figures by the US trade unions, as well as the unemployed classified by the US Bureau of Statistics as "employed but without work," then the actual number of unemployed people in the United States is close to 18 million.

In the competition between the two systems, socialism will surely win

Therefore, the free creative and constructive labor in socialist countries is in stark contrast to the forced unemployment in capitalist countries.

Let those hired hacks try to "prove" that millions of citizens in the United States do not work out of their "own free will." Let them try to prove that the unemployed in the United States and other capitalist countries are not forced to be unemployed. In response to those false propaganda about "forced labor" in the Soviet Union, we can tell those foreign slanderers: "Don't bother talking about others, it's better to look back at yourselves." (The audience was excited and applauded thunderously)

This is the truth of the matter, this is the fact, and it cannot be avoided. Slander is useless. Honest people can see which side the truth is on.

We are moving forward along our path with full confidence, consolidating our socialist motherland day by day.

The task lies in: we Soviet people should work better and better, we should systematically improve our labor productivity, we should organize our work in the best possible way in factories, manufacturing plants, mines, fields, laboratories, in every corner of our vast country, in every zone and front of the great socialist construction. These are the primary things now. And this will ultimately enable us to win the greatest competition between the two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system.

Lenin repeatedly emphasized that the fundamental task of the proletarian revolution is to increase labor productivity. Lenin, in his thesis "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," wrote: "In every socialist revolution, after the proletariat has solved the problem of seizing power, and the task of expropriating the exploiters has been largely completed, it is necessary to put the fundamental task of creating a social system that is superior to capitalism at the forefront; this fundamental task is to increase labor productivity, and therefore (and for this) there must be a better labor organization."

The task we have to undertake is: to maximize the superiority of socialism by systematically improving labor productivity and by socialist organization that is better and greater than capitalism.

Comrade Stalin said: In order to make our Soviet society more prosperous, it is necessary to "make our country have that labor productivity that exceeds the labor productivity of advanced capitalist countries."

Pay attention to exposing shortcomings in work in order to eliminate them in time

Comrades! After giving correct evaluations of achievements, it is also necessary to be able to see, notice, and expose the shortcomings in our work in order to eliminate them in time. It is impossible to achieve successful progress without constant and unremitting struggle against these shortcomings. It is particularly important now to wage a resolute struggle against those who are disloyal to their responsibilities. Unfortunately, some people in our society have been stained with this stain of disloyalty to their work. Among us, there is a type of worker who is usually called a "rice-eating loafer" in colloquial terms. This worker does not think about the damage his work will suffer. He did not think about how much harm and loss our common cause suffered because of his unserious and disloyal attitude towards the responsibility entrusted to him.

Now is the time to raise this issue with the greatest determination, that is, to struggle against slovenly work manifested in all aspects and to struggle against people stained with this stain that is unworthy of socialist society. Whether working in industry, agriculture, science, culture, or art—all of us Soviet people must pay attention: any work that is entrusted to us must be completed well, carefully, and without damage. Constantly improving the quality of work, severely criticizing slovenly and disloyal attitudes towards work, this is our duty. It is not allowed to hide and ignore these disgraceful phenomena in our lives, no matter who they may involve. They must be exposed, made public, and end this shameful thing as soon as possible. Comrades! Along with the outstanding achievements of our socialist motherland is the growing strength of the democratic and socialist forces of the world.

The great victory of the Chinese people is the mark of 1949 The People's Democratic countries of Europe have
Steadfastly embarked on the road of building a socialist society

The people of many countries have steadfastly embarked on the road of building a socialist society. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Albania have made considerable progress on this road.

1949 was marked by the historically significant victory of the Chinese people over the joint forces of the Kuomintang and the American reactionaries. The German Democratic Republic was born in the heart of Europe.

Within the capitalist countries, democratic forces are also growing. The general crisis of the capitalist system is deepening day by day. The pace of mankind moving towards communism is accelerating more and more.

So, what does the capitalist camp use to counter this unstoppable movement of our time? Nothing but the US plan to establish world hegemony, nothing but the preparation for another world slaughter whose devastating consequences will exceed World War II.

The logic of American monopoly capitalists is very simple. They imagine this: if their pockets are full of dollars, then this makes the United States fully capable of becoming the "guardian" of all mankind and makes the United States fully capable of seizing world leadership. The entire post-war aggressive policy of the American ruling group has developed according to this "logic."

This is particularly evident in the attitude towards the fate of Germany.

In accordance with the decision of the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union has consistently followed the line aimed at realizing the political and economic unity of Germany and the line aimed at establishing a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. However, the ruling groups of the United States and Britain, with the support of the French ruling group, violated the Potsdam decision and followed the line aimed at eliminating the German state and the line aimed at using the reactionary fascist and revanchist forces in Germany to turn West Germany into an arsenal and strategic bridgehead against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

The past few years have shown that the US and British ruling groups' agreement to pass the Potsdam Program was extremely superficial and hypocritical. In fact, they had no intention of solving the German problem in the spirit of the obligations they had undertaken. The actual policy of the United States and Britain towards Germany had a clear anti-Potsdam nature from the beginning. Britain, the United States, and France, which have divided Germany, are pushing Germany back a century, that is, pushing Germany back to a period when it was not a nationally unified country.

Now, everyone understands what practical consequences the policies of the American ruling group have caused not only in West Germany but also throughout Western Europe. In France, as a result of the implementation of the Marshall Plan, the economy is becoming increasingly disordered and increasingly destructive. The French aircraft industry is in a difficult situation. Due to lack of orders, aircraft factories are closing down one after another. At the same time, France is purchasing aircraft from the United States in accordance with the Marshall Plan. American merchants are buying French automobile factories at low prices, where they assemble vehicles from parts shipped from the United States. The textile industry is declining because large quantities of American-made textiles are being imported into France duty-free. The French tobacco industry is consciously in a difficult situation; American "benefactors" who cannot find a tobacco market in their own country are sending American tobacco to France as "aid" stipulated by the Marshall Plan. As is well known, grape planting and winemaking occupy an important position in France, and the French people never need imported wine. On the contrary, France itself is a supplier of wine to many countries. However, American merchants, as "aid" to the French people, ordered the French government to accept large quantities of wine stipulated by the Marshall Plan. France, like all Marshallized countries, is now deprived of the opportunity to freely buy and sell what it needs economically. As a result of economic disorder, the number of unemployed people in France has almost doubled in the past two years.

Britain, the main partner of the United States, has not escaped the common fate of all Marshallized countries. The US government, through the Marshall Plan Agency, restricted the types of goods supplied to the People's Democratic countries, thereby greatly reducing Britain's trade with these countries. Americans not only determined the sales market for the British government but also determined the purchase market for it. The competition of American industry based on the Marshall Plan caused a decline in the production of British machinery manufacturing plants. The British economy is withering due to the evil disease of dollar shortage, while American merchants are doing everything they can to exacerbate Britain's dollar crisis.

In Belgium, during the implementation of the Marshall Plan, the production of coal, mill iron and steel, cement, textiles, and cotton fabrics declined. The United States is exporting large quantities of coal to countries that used to buy Belgian coal, thereby harming Belgium's national interests. Therefore, Belgium's coal exports have been greatly reduced. What's more, despite the accumulation of a large amount of mined but unsold coal, Belgium had to import coal from other countries under the terms of the Marshall Plan. This situation has caused a sharp increase in the number of unemployed miners and a crisis in the Belgian coal mining industry. The textile industry is also feeling the difficulty. Due to the large import of American textiles, the production of Belgian textiles has greatly declined. According to official materials, the number of unemployed people in Belgium increased from 95,000 in April 1948 to 339,000 in January 1950.

In Italy, several industries are also declining. A considerable portion of industrial enterprises only operate at 45%–50% of their production capacity. Equipment, supplies, and products that are convenient to manufacture in Italian factories are shipped from the United States. Rolled metal is being imported into Italy, while several Italian steel plants are reducing production. Shipbuilding is shrinking because, according to the Marshall Plan, Italy must purchase a large number of ships from the United States. Under the pressure of the Marshall Plan implementation agency, a series of Italian enterprises are being purged and sold to the United States.

Utilizing the subordinate position of Marshallized countries, the United States is gradually extending its hand to the colonies of Western European countries. According to the latest report from the US Department of Commerce on trade between the United States and overseas territories of Marshall Plan countries in 1948, US exports to French African colonies increased by 6.8 times compared to 1938, to the Belgian Congo by 24 times, to British Malaya by 7.3 times, and to Indonesia by 1.3 times. In the United States, a special committee composed of representatives of several of the largest American banks has even been established to "comfort" France's overseas territories. The representatives of financial capital in the aforementioned committee have already begun to establish branches of their companies in French colonies and are expanding their asset investments there.

The result of the Marshall Plan's implementation The independence of Western European countries has been stripped away

So, what has the Marshall Plan brought to Western European countries and their people? As a result of the implementation of the Marshall Plan, Western European countries are gradually being deprived of their national independence. Western European countries, which have become markets for American second-hand goods, are now forced to reduce several major sectors of their national industries in order to expand the market for American industry. The ever-increasing American economic crisis and the Marshall Plan have been imported into Western European countries, and accompanying this crisis is its direct partner—unemployment and poverty of the working masses. The United States is using the Marshall Plan to turn Western Europe into a military strategic bridgehead for American aggression. Under the pressure of American aggressors, Marshallized countries are expanding their military budgets and are frantically arming themselves.

In France, military spending increased from 179 billion francs in 1946 to 300 billion francs in 1948, accounting for 35% of the total budget expenditure for 1948. In 1949, France's military spending reached 800 billion francs. In Italy, the budget for 1949-50 stipulated appropriations for military purposes totaling 301.3 billion lire, accounting for one-third of the entire national budget. In Britain, military spending for 1949-50 accounted for 30% of all budget expenditures. Sweden's current military spending is eight times that of pre-war. The United States' spending for military purposes irrefutably proves the aggressive nature of American policy.

Good people of the world resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression

As is well known, the total amount of the US national budget for 1949-1950 has been approved at $41.9 billion. The budget stipulates direct military expenditures of $14.3 billion, exceeding direct military expenditures in the 1938-1939 budget by 13.9 times. However, military expenditures should also include the so-called "international affairs and finance" expenses related to aggressive foreign policy and the so-called "development of natural resources" expenses that directly belong to the production of atomic weapons and other military measures. Counting the aforementioned expenses and war pensions together, military expenditures in the budget reached $28.4 billion, or 68% of the entire budget.

It should be pointed out here that the US budget for 1949-1950 only stipulated $3.2 billion for public health, education, housing construction, etc., accounting for 7.6% of all national expenditures, of which education expenses were only $400 million, accounting for less than 1% of the budget.

According to the message of US President Truman on the budget for 1950-1951 published on January 9, 1950, the US government intends to spend more than $32 billion, almost 76% of its entire budget, for its own armed forces (including the cost of producing atomic bombs) and for implementing the policy of organizing aggressive military blocs and arming the countries participating in these blocs.

The Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Aggression Pact are further means of expanding and strengthening the network of military bases. Under the guise of "helping" Marshallized countries to rebuild and construct ports, roads, airports, and other military strategic objects, the United States is actually engaged in battlefield preparation in Western European countries.

The policy of American aggressors clearly proves the correctness of Lenin's thesis that "due to the oppression of financial oligarchies and the elimination of free competition, the political characteristics of imperialism are thorough reaction and increasingly aggravated national oppression..."

The good people of the world, including the American people, resolutely condemn the policy of American aggressors. This policy is manifested in suppressing the national freedom and independence of all ethnic groups, in the arms race, and in preparing for new wars.

The Soviet Union adheres to a policy of peace

Will not give up all methods and is prepared to actively participate in all plans, measures and actions to prevent new wars and defend peace.

The Soviet Union offers resolute resistance to the aggressive camp. The Soviet Union's unwavering policy of peace is supported and endorsed by all progressive mankind.

The evidence of the aggressors' crimes is conclusive and cannot be denied, so they attempt to use malicious propaganda against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries to justify the arms race they have already launched. They slander the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, vilifying them as enemies of peace.

What is there to say about the absurd claim that the Soviet Union has non-peaceful ambitions? We have always shown the world with actions that the Soviet people are engaged in socialist construction, are pursuing a peace-loving policy and do not want war (applause).

Let the aggressors and the self-serving rumor-mongers who carry out their orders arbitrarily clamor against the Soviet Union! We will still tirelessly and unwaveringly pursue a consistent policy of peace (lasting applause). The Soviet government proposed last year that the five great powers—the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union—conclude a treaty to strengthen peace. The aggressors hindered this proposal and then continued to adhere to the position of instigating new wars. In response to the adventurist policy of the aggressors, regardless of their political views and beliefs, we declare to all honest political and social leaders: they can rely on the Soviet Union as the most resolute opponent of new wars and as a faithful, genuine, and unwavering supporter of world peace (long applause).

We firmly believe that the aggressive policy of the war instigators will end in shameful failure.

The Soviet Union and our close friends in Asia—China—and the People's Democratic countries of Europe maintain close friendship, guard and will continue to resolutely guard peace, unite the people who support peace, and expose the adventurous policies of the warmongers (long applause).

Because the Soviet government, which stands for universal peace, will not give up all methods to ensure further efforts for peace and is prepared to actively participate in all plans, measures and actions to prevent new wars and defend peace (stormy applause).

Comrades! In conclusion, let me express my deep gratitude to you, and through you to all voters in the Leningrad constituency of Moscow, for your trust in me

　　莫斯科列宁格勒选区选民会议上
    马林科夫发表演说
　　指出：苏联、中国及人民民主国家，共同警卫着世界和平！
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：马林科夫九日在莫斯科列宁格勒选区选民会议上发表演说，讲词如下：
    同志们！苏联最高苏维埃选举将于三月十二日举行。我们大家都相信，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的公民们将一致投票选举党与非党联盟的候选人。（鼓掌）
    苏维埃人民参加苏联最高苏维埃选举，深信共产党与苏维埃政府的政策的正确性，这一政策目的在于进一步发展我国国民经济的各部门，逐步提高劳动人民的物质福利，并保证全世界的和平。（鼓掌）
    毫无疑义，我们人民将在三月十二日表明他们紧密地团结在他们自己的共产党和苏维埃政府的周围。（鼓掌）
    自从上届苏联最高苏维埃选举以来，到现在已经有四年了。在这四年当中，苏维埃人民在共产党的领导下，已在社会主义经济与文化各方面赢得了巨大的胜利。
  共产党领导下的苏联人民，在经济、文化各方面赢得巨大胜利。
    斯大林同志曾于一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科斯大林选区的选民会议上发表演说，概述了共产党最近将来的工作计划，他说：“就像你们所知道的，这些计划订在即将通过的新五年计划中。新的五年计划的主要任务乃是复兴我国被破坏的地区，恢复工业与农业到战前的水平，然后在多少相当大的程度上超过这个水平。除了将于最近将来取消配给制以外，将特别注意扩大消费品的生产，以减低一切商品的价格来提高劳动人民的生活水平，并广泛组织能充分发挥我国科学力量的各种科学研究机关。”
    恢复被战争破坏了的经济，乃是我党在战争胜利结束之后必须解决的紧急任务。必须在短时间内致力恢复被破坏了的城市、村庄、工厂、制造厂、铁路与农业的大规模工作。
    早在战争期间，当暂时被敌人占领的城镇与乡村解放了的时候，就已着手恢复曾被德寇占领的地区了。但是，这种工作在战争结束后，就在特别大的规模上发展起来。在五年计划头四年当中，被占领过的地区的基本建设工程，其规模占苏联国民经济的全部基本建设工程的百分之三十七。现在，这些地区的经济、文化与服务机关的恢复工作已大体完成。
    在一九四九年第四季，这些地区的工业总产量已达战前一九四○年水平百分之一百零六。
    到一九四九年末，这些地区的煤、电力、拖拉机、水泥、酸性磷酸盐及其他种类的工业生产量，已超过战前水平。
    在遭受破坏的地区，冶金、化学、与机器制造厂、煤矿、矿山、电力站、成千个轻工业企业与食品工业企业，已告恢复。指出这一点是重要的，这就是在现代化技术的基础上和对科学与工程学方面的最新成就予以适当的注意来从事复兴工业。已恢复的企业都有完善的具有高度效力的装备。随着这些地区的工业的恢复，新工厂与制造厂也在大规模建筑中。
    在农业的恢复方面，亦已获得了巨大的成就。
    在被占领过的地区，一九四九年谷物、甜菜、亚麻、葵花子、洋芋及其他农作物的总产量已超过了战前水平。所有的机器与拖拉机站已恢复了，而且成立了许多新站。
    在被破坏的地区，学校、高等教育机关、文化机关与医院网已迅速恢复。初小、七年制学校与中等学校网不仅已经恢复，而且已经大大地扩大了。一九四九年高等教育机关的学生人数达二十四万八千，在技术学校的达四十万七千，这大大地超过了一九四○年高等教育机关和技术学校的学生人数。
    一九四九年这些地区的病床数目较一九四○年多二万六千。医生较战前增加二万三千人。
    由于许多城镇和村庄被敌人夷为平地，使恢复被占领地区的房舍成为一桩巨大而复杂的任务，但到一九四九年年底，各城镇中百分之九十的房舍已告恢复了。解放以来，在遭受战争灾害地区的城市和工人住宅区修复和新建的房舍，总面积共计五千八百万平方公尺以上，而在乡村居民区已经修复和新建了约三百万栋房屋。
  若干重要生产部门  超过五年计划目标
    由于完成了战后五年计划头四年计划的结果，苏联整个国民经济已大大地超过战前一九四○年的水平。苏联一九四九年全部工业总产量超过一九四○年水平百分之四十一。到一九四九年年底，工业已按照比五年计划为一九五○年规定的还要高的水平而进行生产。国民经济的若干重要部门已大大超过五年计划的目标。
    五年计划规定一九五○年钢铁工业的钢与辗金属产量超过战前水平的百分之三十五。实际上，一九四九年第四季辗金属的生产就超过一九四○年水平的百分之四十七，而钢的产量则超过百分之三十七。非铁金属的产量同样已大为增加。
    根据五年计划，顿尼兹盆地的煤产量要恢复到战前水平，并且要在一九五○年超过这一水平。在一九四九年的第四季，顿尼兹盆地的煤产量就已经达到一九四○年的水平，而采煤工业部各煤坑的整个煤产量则达到了五年计划为一九五○年所规定的水平。
    五年计划规定一九四九年石油产量要达到战前水平，并在一九五○年超过这一水平的百分之十四。实际上，一九四九年第四季的石油产量就超过一九四○年的百分之十六。
    在电气化方面，五年计划规定一九五○年的电力生产要比一九四○年增加百分之七十。这一目标已接近于完成。一九四九年电力生产超过一九四○年的百分之六十二。
    机器与装备的生产较战前大为增加。一九四九年拖拉机的产量几为一九四○年的三倍，汽车几为两倍，联合机几为二倍半，冶金设备四倍，电动机两倍半，掘凿机十倍。蒸气透平、机车、火车厢、纺机、织机和其他装备已大为增加。在化学、木材和造纸工业中，在建筑材料业和国民经济的其他部门中，也获得了伟大的成就。
    战后五年计划期间消费品的生产大大地增加了。与一九四五年相较，一九四九年的产量，毛织物已增加二·七倍，棉织品二·二倍，丝织品二·九倍，麻织品二·一倍，袜类四·一倍，皮鞋类二·六倍，肉类一倍半以上，牛油二·八倍，植物油二·五倍，鱼类一·七倍，糖类四·四倍，肥皂三倍。在过去这一时期中，从事农业生产的劳动人民也获得了重大成就。
    五年计划的法律，规定农业的主要任务是，在大大提高农业效率与广泛利用进步农业科学与技术成就的基础上，最大量地增加农业品的产量和收获量。
    整个地说来，一九四九年苏联巨量的农业生产已超过战前一九四○年的水平。一九四九年全部谷物的收获已提高到七十六亿普特，这数字已超过一九四○年的水平，而且几乎达到了五年计划所规定的一九五○年的生产量。棉花、亚麻、葵花子和马铃薯的收获量也大大超过了战前水平。
    社会主义工业的成就，使战后五年计划期间有可能大大地提高农业技术设备，这保证了农业劳动机械化水平进一步的提高，在一九四六年至四九年，工业部门生产了四十三万多部拖拉机（以十五匹马力为一部）、四万八千部联合机以及许多其他农业上所需要的机器。
    一九四八年年底，党和政府通过了种植防护林、实行牧草作物轮种制、建筑池塘和蓄水池，以保证苏联欧洲部分的草原地带和森林草原地带年年丰收的计划。这些计划现在正在成功地实现着。到一九四九年年底，防护林已种植了五十九万公顷，此外已准备好十万公顷土地准备来年种植。
    在谷物生产增加所达成就的基础上，党和政府并规定了全部集体农场农民和国营农场工人最大量地发展牲畜业的任务。这一任务是党和政府在发展农业方面的中心问题。
    一九四九年四月，苏联部长会议及联共（布）党中央委员会通过了在一九四九年至一九五一年发展集体农场和国家农场牲畜业的三年计划。这个计划规定了发展集体农场和国家农场牲畜业的纲领，保证了集体农场福利的进一步的大量增进，并且使得满足人民对肉、脂肪、牛奶和乳品的日益增加的需求以及轻工业对羊毛、皮革、和畜类产品的需求成为可能。
    从事于农业的劳动人民正以极大的热情在实现着发展牲畜业的三年计划，并且已经获得了巨大成就。一九四九年，约有七万二千个集体农场牲畜饲养站和四万八千个集体农场鸡鸭饲养站已经组织起来了。一九四九年，集体农场上牲畜的数量较一九四八年有如下的增加：食用与乳用牛百分之二十一（其中母牛增加百分之二十七），猪百分之七十八，绵羊与山羊百分之十九。鸡鸭数增加了一倍。一九四九年，苏联国家农场部所属国家农场的牲畜也增加了：食用与乳用牛百分之十三，猪百分之四十六，绵羊与山羊百分之十二。
  人民生活继续提高
    一九四九年与一九四○年比较：职工收入增百分之廿四  农民收入增百分之三十  国家给人民的津贴补助等费用多出两倍。
    工业与农业方面现已获得的成就，保证了我国国民收入的增加，并使工人、农民和知识分子的物质条件之大大改进成为可能。一九四九年，苏联国民收入，以比较价格计算，较一九四○年增加了百分之三十六。职工的薪资增加了，农民在集体耕作与家庭园地方面和个人经济方面的收入也已增加。
    在过去一段时期内，消费品的价格曾三次减低。人民从第一次减低物价获益约八百六十亿卢布，从第二次减低物价又额外获益约七百一十亿卢布，而从最近第三次减低物价人民将至少获益一千一百亿卢布。由于减低物价的结果，职工的实际工资已经大大地增加了，而农民为购买制成品的支出减少了。
    关怀人民的福利、关怀他们的物质与文化水平之提高，这是社会主义的不变的法则。
    斯大林同志说：在社会主义的苏联国民经济制度下，国民收入的分配并不是为了使剥削阶级及其大批寄生从仆发财致富，而是为了有系统地改进工人与农民的物质条件和扩大城乡的社会主义生产。
    在苏联，职工的物质保障并不仅限于工资，而农民的物质保障也不仅限于农业收入。在我国，人民并在国家的开支项下得到津贴、社会保险费、养老金、免费医疗帮助、住疗养院和休憩所的便利，免费或低费的儿童保育机关、多子女母亲和单身母亲的津贴、免费教育和提高技术的便利、学生的津贴、以及其他津贴和补助费。所有的职工都有至少两星期的由国家出钱的假期。一九四九年，人民在国家开支的款项下获得的上述津贴与补助费，其总数已超过一千一百亿卢布，这个数目较一九四○年几乎多两倍。整个说来，一九四九年的职工收入以比较价格按单个工人计算，较一九四○年高出百分之二十四，而农民的收入按单个农民计算增加了百分之三十。
    我国没有失业者。
    相反地，职工人数年年都在增加。一九四九年，职工人数较一九四○年增加了百分之十五。
    战后五年计划的年代中，在社会主义文化的各方面也同样获得了巨大的成就。到一九四九年年底，在各级学校、技术学校和其他专门教育机关学习的，有三千六百万人以上。医药机关网已经扩大。在房舍建筑上正在完成大批的工程。
    按照斯大林同志所规定的任务，在战后五年计划的头四年中，在建设新的科学研究机关与训练专家方面，已做了许多工作。一九四九年科学研究机关的数目已较一九四○年增加半倍，而科学工作者则几乎增加了两倍。已经大规模地组织了新科学工作者的训练。一九四九年有一千一百一十五所科学研究机关和高等教育机关训练着科学工作者，而战前则仅有六百七十八所科学机关和高等教育机关训练研究生。
    高等教育机关网已按照国民经济的需要而加以扩充。高等教育机关的学生，包括函授学生在内，达一百一十二万八千，超过战前学生数目三十一万六千人。
    一九四九年从高等教育机关和技术学校毕业并已参加国民经济工作的专家总数，较一九四○年增加百分之六十八。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日那次具有历史意义的演说中所规定的任务，就是这样来完成的。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
  苏联的巨大胜利证明了社会主义制度的优越性
    我国劳动人民在恢复与进一步发展国民经济中所得到的胜利，再度生动地向全世界说明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。一切诚实的人民都看到列宁和斯大林的党已在我国人民中激发了怎样巨大的力量，怎样源源不绝的精力。
    资产阶级国家的统治集团力求对广大群众隐瞒苏联工人阶级和全体劳动人民生活水平不断提高的真相。但他们能拿出什么来与苏维埃生活这些众所周知的事实——像不知有经济危机的社会主义经济的日益发展，像失业的完全消灭，实际工资的不断增加，男女同工同酬，大规模的社会保险，免费的医药援助，休假制度，国家对儿童、孕妇和哺乳母亲的关怀等——相抗衡呢？
    因为驳不倒这些无可争辩的事实，我们的敌人便依赖最拙劣的捏造和欺诈。他们胡说什么苏联存在着所谓“强迫劳动”，这就是很好的例子。根据事实判断：美国和英国政府的官方代表以及美国劳联、产联和英国职工大会最高委员会反动的领导集团，积极参加了这一运动，美国和英国的统治集团特别重视这一挑衅性冒险。各种各样的造谣者、受雇的无聊文人和奸细们的目的，是不难洞悉的。他们亟需减低人民大众对资本主义世界经济日益增长的危机的注意，这种危机是与劳动群众生活水平的猛烈下降、大规模失业和贫困的增加伴随而来的。
    不但是我们苏联人民，而且外国一切诚实的男女都很知道，工人、集体农民和知识分子的自由的、建设性的、创造性的劳动，是我们社会主义国家的繁荣与发展的基础，是劳动人民物质福利不断增进的基础。
    在苏维埃制度下，工人不是为剥削者而工作的，却为自己、为自己的阶级、为社会而工作。斯大林曾说：“在这里，工人不会感到被藐视，不会感到孤独。相反的，做工的人感觉自己是他的国家的自由公民，从某种意义上说来，是社会上的人物。而且，假如他工作得很好，并尽其所能贡献于社会，那么，他就是劳动英雄，并享有光荣。”
    正因为苏联人民的劳动是自由的，所以他们的生产率才能这样迅速地不断提高。更大的劳动生产率使工、农业生产成本得以减低，从而保证了减低物价的可能，并使劳动人民的福利得以逐步增进。
    国民经济的社会主义制度大大地优于资本主义制度：其目的在使人类生活幸福的纪元早日在世界上实现；而另一方面，资本主义则早已成为人类社会发展的制动机，成为垂死的社会制度了；资本主义制度毫无理性地浪费着生产力和千百万人民的生命，注定了越来越广大的人民群众的半饥饿、贫穷和灭亡。
    一九五○年年初，失业紧紧抓住了一切资本主义国家里约四千五百万人民。据官方统计，美国在一九五○年一月全失业人数达四百五十万，这就比一九四八年十月多一点七倍。此外，在一九四九年年底，美国还有一千万半失业者，即每周工作时间不够的人。这样，甚至美国官方统计都承认美国失业与半失业的人数已经超过一千四百五十万人。然而，假若考虑到美国工会对官方失业数字的修正数目，以及美国统计局所划为“有职业而无工作”一类的失业者，那么美国实际失业人数将近一千八百万人。
  在两种制度竞赛中社会主义必获胜利
    所以社会主义国家里自由创造性的建设性的劳动，便与资本主义国家里被迫失业成了显明的对比。
    让那些御用文人们尝试着“证明”美国千百万公民都是出于他们“自己的自由意志”而不工作吧。让他们尝试着证明美国以及其他资本主义国家里的失业者都不是被迫失业吧。为答复那些关于苏联“强迫劳动”的虚伪宣传，我们可以告诉那些国外的中伤者们说：“不要费心谈论人家了，不如回顾一下自己吧。”（全场振奋、掌声雷动）
    这便是事情的真象，这是事实，是无法闪避的。诽谤是没有用的。诚实的人民看得出来真理是在那一边的。
    我们满怀信心地沿着我们的道路前进，一天一天地巩固着我们社会主义的祖国。
    任务在于：我们苏联人民应该愈加好地工作，应该有步骤地提高我们的劳动生产率，应该在工厂、制造厂、矿山、田地、实验室中、在我们幅圆广阔的国家的各个角落、在伟大的社会主义建设的各个地带和各个阵线上，精益求精地组织我们的工作。现在这些是首要的。而这归根结底将使我们能够在两种制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度——的最伟大的竞赛中获得胜利。
    列宁再三强调说：无产阶级革命的基本任务正是要提高劳动生产率。列宁在他的论文《苏维埃政权的当前任务》中写道：“在每一个社会主义革命中，当无产阶级已经解决了夺取政权的问题，剥夺剥削者的任务在大体上已经完成之后，必然把创造那优于资本主义的社会制度的基本任务，提到最前位；这个基本任务就是提高劳动生产率，因此（并且为此）就要有更好的劳动组织。”
    我们所要承担的任务是：以有步骤地提高劳动生产率，以社会主义较资本主义更好的、更大的组织性来最大限度地利用社会主义的优越。
    斯大林同志说：为了使我们的苏维埃社会更加繁荣，必须要“使我国有超过先进资本主义国家的劳动生产率的那种劳动生产率”。
  注意揭露工作缺点以便及时消灭它们
    同志们！把成就予以正确的评价后，同时也必须能够看出、注意到和揭露出我们工作中的缺点，以便及时消灭它们。没有和这些缺点进行经常不懈的斗争，则不可能获得成功的进展。现在和对自己的责任抱不忠实的态度作坚决斗争，这是特别重要的。不幸的是，在我们的社会中也有人染上了这种不忠实于自己工作的污点。在我们中间，有一种在俗话上通常就叫做浑饭吃的工人。这种工人没有想到他的工作会遭受损坏的事情。他没想到由于他对于所交付给他的责任采取不认真和不忠实的态度而使我们的共同事业遭受了多少伤害与损失。
    现在正是用最大决心提出这个问题的时候了，这就是和表现在各方面的疲蹋工作进行斗争，和染有这种不配于社会主义社会的污点的人进行斗争。不管是在工业、农业、科学、文化、或是艺术方面工作——我们全体苏联人民一定要留意：凡是交给我们的工作一定要好好地、谨慎地、没有损坏地予以完成。经常改进工作质量、严峻地批评对工作的疲蹋、不忠实的态度，这是我们分内的责任。不允许隐藏和漠视我们生活中的这些不光彩现象，不管它们会牵连到谁。必须把它们揭露出来，把它们公之于众人面前并且尽速结束这种丢脸的事情。同志们！与我们社会主义祖国的卓越成就俱来的，就是全世界民主与社会主义力量的日益成长壮大。
  中国人民的伟大胜利是一九四九年的标志  欧洲人民民主国家已
        坚定地走上建设社会主义社会的道路
    许多国家的人民已坚定地走上了建设社会主义社会的道路。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚，已在这条路上有了可观的进展。
    一九四九年是以中国人民对国民党和美国反动派联合力量的具有历史意义的胜利为标志的。德意志民主共和国在欧洲的心脏诞生了。
    在各资本主义国家内部，民主力量也正在成长中。资本主义制度的总危机一天天加深。人类向共产主义迈进的步调，正越来越加速。
    那么，资本主义阵营用什么来和我们时代的这一抑制不住的运动相抗衡呢？没有别的，不过是美国建立世界霸权的计划，不过是准备其毁灭性后果将超过第二次世界大战的另一次世界屠杀。
    美国垄断资本家的逻辑是非常简单的。他们这样想像：假如他们的荷包塞满了美元，那么，这就使美国完全有能力去变成全人类的“监护人”，使美国完全有能力去攫夺全世界的领导权。美国统治集团的全部战后侵略政策，就是按照着这种“逻辑”发展的。
    这一点在对德国命运的态度上，表现得尤其明显。
    苏联按照着波茨坦会议的决定，始终如一地遵循旨在实现德国的政治与经济统一的路线，遵循旨在建立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国的战线。而美国和英国的统治集团在法国统治集团的支持下，违反波茨坦决定，遵循旨在消灭德意志国家的路线，遵循旨在利用德国反动的法西斯与复仇主义力量、把西德变成对付苏联和人民民主国家的兵工厂和战略桥头堡垒的路线。
    过去几年已说明美国和英国统治集团的同意通过波茨坦纲领，是极其表面和假惺惺的。实际上它们完全不想按照它们所承担的义务的精神去解决德国问题。英美对德国的实际政策，一开头就具有明白的反波茨坦性质。已使德国分裂的英国、美国和法国，正在使德国后退一个世纪，这就是使德国退回到不是一个举国统一的国家的时期。
    现在，大家都明白：美国统治集团的政策不但在西德而且在全西欧造成了怎样的实际后果。在法国，由于马歇尔计划的实行，经济正越来越紊乱，越来越破坏。法国的飞机工业正处在困难的境地。由于缺乏定货，飞机制造厂正在纷纷倒闭。同时，法国却按照马歇尔计划而向美国购买飞机。美国商人正在以低价收买法国汽车工厂，他们在这些厂里把自美国运来的零件装成车辆。纺织工业正在凋落，因为大批美造纺织品正免税输入法国。法国烟草工业自觉处境困难；在本国找不到烟草市场的美国“恩人”正在把美国烟草送往法国，作为马歇尔计划规定的“援助”。如所周知，栽种葡萄和酿酒业在法国占重要地位，法国人民永远不需要进口的酒。相反，法国本身乃是许多国家的酒的供应者。但是，美国商人作为对法国人民的“援助”，命令法国政府接受马歇尔计划所规定的大量酒类。法国和所有马歇尔化的国家一样，现在被剥夺了自由买卖它在经济上所需要的东西的机会。由于经济上紊乱的结果，近两年来，法国失业人数增加了将近二倍。
    美国的主要伙伴英国，也没有逃掉一切马歇尔化国家的共同命运。美国政府通过马歇尔计划机构，限制供给人民民主国家的货物种类，从而大大减少了英国对这些国家的贸易。美国人不仅给英国政府确定了销售市场，而且给它确定了购买市场。美国工业在马歇尔计划的基础上进行的竞争，使英国器械制造工厂的生产下降。英国经济患了美元缺乏的恶疾而萎靡不振，而美国商人却正在竭尽其全力加剧英国的美元危机。
    在比利时，在马歇尔计划实行期间，煤、铣铁和钢、水泥、纺织品与棉织品的生产下降了。美国正在输出大量的煤斤到那些过去一直是购买比利时煤的国家去，从而损害了比利时的国家利益。因此，比利时煤的出口已大为减少。尤有进者，尽管积存有大量开采了的但还没有售出的煤斤，在马歇尔计划条款之下，比利时不得不从其他国家输入煤。这种情况造成了矿工失业人数的激增和比利时煤矿工业的危机。纺织工业也感到处境的困难。由于美国纺织品的大量输入，比利时纺织品的生产已大大下降。根据官方材料，比利时失业人数自一九四八年四月的九万五千人增加到一九五○年一月的三十三万九千人。
    在意大利，若干工业也在下降。相当大一部分工业企业只开动了它们生产能力的百分之四十五——百分之五十。在意大利工厂里制造起来很方便的装备、供应品与生产品，却从美国运来。辗金属正在输入意大利，而意大利若干钢铁厂则正在减缩生产。造船业正在萎缩中，因为按照马歇尔计划，意大利必须从美国购买大量的船只。在马歇尔计划执行机构的压力下，一系列的意大利企业正被肃清的肃清，出卖给美国的出卖给美国。
    利用马歇尔化国家的从属地位，美国正逐渐地把它的手伸到西欧国家的殖民地上。根据美国商务部关于一九四八年美国与马歇尔计划国家海外领地间贸易的最新报告，美国对法属非洲殖民地的输出额较一九三八年增加了六·八倍，对比属刚果增加了二十四倍，对英属马来亚增加了七·三倍，对印尼增加了一·三倍。在美国，甚至还成立了一个由美国几家最大银行的代表所组成的专门委员会，来“慰勉”法国的海外领地。上述委员会的金融资本的代表已经开始在法国殖民地设立了他们公司的分公司，并且正在那里扩大他们的资产投资。
  马歇尔计划执行的结果  西欧国家独立被剥夺
    那么，马歇尔计划给西欧国家和他们的人民带来了什么呢？由于马歇尔计划执行的结果，西欧国家正在逐渐地被剥夺着他们的国家独立。已经变成了美国旧货市场的西欧国家，为了给美国工业扩大市场，现在又被迫缩减他们民族工业中的若干主要部门。日渐增涨的美国经济危机和马歇尔计划一道已经被输入到西欧国家，而伴随着这种危机的还有它那直接的伙伴——劳动群众的失业和贫穷。美国利用马歇尔计划，将西欧变为美国进行侵略的军事战略桥头堡垒。在美国侵略者的压力下，马歇尔化的国家正在扩大他们的军事预算，并且正在疯狂地武装自己。
    在法国，军费自一九四六年的一千七百九十亿法郎增至一九四八年的三千亿法郎，占一九四八年度预算总开支的百分之三十五。在一九四九年，法国的军费达八千亿法郎。意大利的一九四九——五○年度的预算中规定用于军事用途的拨款，达三千零十三亿里拉，占整个国家预算的三分之一。在英国，一九四九——五○年度的军费占全部预算开支的百分之三十。瑞典目前的军费为战前的八倍。美国用于军事用途的开支，无可争辩地证明了美国政策的侵略性质。
    世界各国善良人民坚决反对美帝侵略
    如所周知，美国一九四九——一九五○年度国家预算总额已被批准为四百一十九亿美元。预算规定直接军事支出为一百四十三亿美元，超过一九三八——一九三九年度预算中的直接军事支出十三·九倍。但是，在军事支出中还应加上那些与侵略性外交政策有关的所谓“国际事务与财政”费用和直接属于生产原子武器及其他军事措施的所谓“开发天然资源”费用。把上述费用以及战争抚恤费算在一起，预算中的军事支出便达二百八十四亿美元或者占全部预算百分之六十八。
    在这一点上应该指出：美国一九四九——一九五○年度预算对公共卫生、教育、房屋建造费等等只规定了三十二亿美元，即占全部国家支出的百分之七·六，其中教育费则只有四亿美元，即不足预算的百分之一。
    根据一九五○年一月九日所发表的美国总统杜鲁门关于一九五○——一九五一年预算的咨文，美国政府为它自己的武装部队（包括生产原子弹的费用），为执行组织侵略性军事集团的政策、武装参加这些集团的国家，打算耗款三百二十亿美元以上，几占其全部预算百分之七十六。
    马歇尔计划和北大西洋侵略公约，是扩大并加强军事基地网的进一步手段。在伪称“帮助”马歇尔化国家重建和建设港口、公路、机场和其他军事战略物的托词下，美国实际上正在西欧各国从事战场的准备。
    美国侵略者的政策清晰地证明了列宁的论题的正确性，即“由于金融寡头政治的压迫和自由竞争的消灭，帝国主义的政治特色是彻头彻尾的反动和日益加剧的民族压迫……。”
    世界各国的善良人民包括美国人民在内坚决地谴责美国侵略者的政策。这一政策表现在压制各族人民的民族自由和独立，表现在军备竞赛和准备新战争上面。
  苏联坚守和平政策
    将不放弃以一切方法，并准备积极参加一切计划、措施和行动，防止新战争，保卫和平。
    苏联对侵略阵营予以坚决的抵抗。苏联坚守不渝的和平政策得到一切进步人类的拥护与支持。
    侵略者的罪证确凿，无法辩解，于是他们就企图用反苏和反人民民主国家的恶意宣传，来替他们所已发动的军备竞赛制造口实，他们诽谤苏联和人民民主国家，诋毁它们为和平的敌人。
    对于指责苏联具有非和平性质的野心这一荒谬言论还有什么可说呢？我们一直以行动向全世界表明：苏联人民正从事社会主义建设，正奉行爱好和平的政策并且不要战争（鼓掌）。
    让侵略者和执行他们的命令的唯利是图的造谣生事者任意对苏联叫嚣吧！我们仍将不倦不懈，坚守不渝地奉行一贯的和平政策（经久的鼓掌）。苏联政府去年曾建议五强——美、英、法、中、苏——缔结加强和平的公约。侵略者阻挠了这个建议，以后并继续固守挑拨新战争的立场。为了答复侵略者的冒险主义政策，不分其政治见解与信仰如何，我们向一切正直的政治与社会领袖宣布：他们可以信赖苏联为新战争的最坚决的反对者，为全世界和平的忠实的、真正的与始终不渝的支持者。（长久的掌声）。
    我们坚信战争挑拨者的侵略政策将以可耻的失败告终。
    苏联与我们在亚洲的挚友——中国及欧洲的人民民主国家保持亲密的友谊，警卫着并且将继续坚决地警卫着和平，团结拥护和平的人们并揭露战争贩子的冒险政策（长时鼓掌）。
    由于普遍和平的苏联政府将不放弃以一切方法保证和平的更进一步的努力，并准备积极参加一切计划、措施和行动，来防止新战争和保卫和平。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！在结束时，让我向你们，并通过你们向莫斯科的列宁格勒选区全体选民表示我深深地感谢你们对我的信任，提名我为苏联最高苏维埃代表的候选人。
