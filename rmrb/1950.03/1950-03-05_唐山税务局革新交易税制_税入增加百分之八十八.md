　　Tangshan Tax Bureau Reforms Transaction Tax System
    Tax Revenue Increases by 88 Percent
    [Our Newspaper] The Tangshan Tax Bureau's reform of the transaction tax system not only benefits merchants and the people but also increases tax revenue by 88 percent compared to before liberation. Tangshan City is a distribution center for most mountain goods in eastern Hebei Province and a hub for material exchange between Beijing, Tianjin, and the Northeast. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government's tooth taxes on grain, livestock, mountain goods, vegetables, chicken and duck eggs, salt, and vermicelli were all contracted out by local bullies and gentry, who pocketed the profits at every level. Farmers and merchants suffered severe extortion and exploitation. After liberation, the Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau first abolished the Kuomintang's tax contracting system and eliminated the collection of taxes on vegetables, chicken and duck eggs, salt, and vermicelli. Livestock, grain, and mountain goods, being bulk commodities, required management and were converted to transaction taxes, collected directly by the tax bureau. To eliminate past malpractices, the tax bureau organized, registered, educated, and reformed the brokers. Except for a few who were purged, most were issued "Transaction Agent" (i.e., broker) badges and entered into covenants and disciplines. In their work, in addition to establishing a secret reporting system, cultivating key personnel, and conducting planned inspections of transaction agents, they also regularly held meetings or individual talks, using self-criticism and mutual supervision methods, which yielded great results. For example, the transaction agents in the livestock market, recognizing the need to serve the people, revealed in inspections that 19 individuals had accepted money from buyers and 9 had colluded with livestock dealers to deceive buyers and sellers. After such rectification and education, the malpractices of "eating commissions," "taking heads," and "covering positives" were overcome, and three sellers of livestock with improper origins (stolen or swindled) were discovered. After this rectification, the transaction tax increased significantly compared to the past. Although the tax rate was the same at 3 percent before and after liberation, the revenue from livestock alone, after deducting 30 percent commission for transaction agents from the tax revenue, exceeded the revenue during the Kuomintang reactionary government period by 88.35 percent (note: based on a comparison of the average monthly figures for November 1948 and 1949). In addition, by establishing transaction markets for livestock, grain, cotton, and mountain goods in conjunction with the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Monopoly Corporation, and organizing a management committee, the phenomenon of farmers and small traders being unable to sell their goods after several days of mobile transactions was overcome. Even buying and selling in shops was no longer subject to deception by shopkeepers, large merchants, and brokers.

　　唐山税务局革新交易税制
    税入增加百分之八十八
    【本报讯】唐山税务局改革交易税制，不仅做到便商利民，而且使税入较解放前增加百分之八十八。唐山市为河北省东部大部山货的集散地，京津与东北物资交流的枢纽。解放前国民党反动政府在此所征粮食、牲畜、山货、青菜、鸡鸭蛋、盐、粉条等牙税，均由豪绅转包，层层中饱，农民商贩受着严重的勒索剥削，解放后，该市人民政府税务局，首先取消了国民党的包税制度，并废除了青菜、鸡鸭蛋、盐、粉条的征收。牲畜、粮食、山货因系大宗，须加管理，改征为交易税。由税局直接征收。为铲除过去积弊，税局对牙纪进行了组织、登记、教育、改造，除个别的洗刷外，一般均发给了“交易员”（即牙纪）证章，订立了公约、纪律。在工作中，除建立密报，培养骨干，有计划的进行对交易员的检查外，并经常不断地召开会议或个别谈话，用自我检查及互相监督的办法，收到了很大效果，如牲畜市场的交易员，认识了为人民服务，在检查中有十九个人说出过去接受了买主的钱，九个与牲畜贩子合伙作买卖欺骗买方与卖方。经过这样整理教育，克服了“吃合子”、“拿头”、“盖阳”等弊病，并发现了三个牲畜来源不正当的卖主（偷骗来的）。经过这番整理，使交易税较过去大有增加，在解放前后同为百分之三的税率，但仅牲畜一项除由税款中提给交易员百分之三十佣金外，税入超过了国民党反动政府时期百分之八十八点三五（按：系根据一九四八年十一月及一九四九年每月平均数比较）。此外，由于结合工商、公安两局及专卖公司建立牲畜、粮食、棉花、山货、交易市场，组织管理委员会，克服了过去农民、小贩流动交易几天卖不了的现象。即在店内买卖，也不再受店栈、大商贩子及牙纪的欺骗了。
