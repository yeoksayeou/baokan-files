　　Following Surprise Audits by the Tax Bureau
    False Accounting and Tax Evasion Uncovered in Kaifeng
    Facts Prove Industrial and Commercial Tax is Not Heavy
    [This Report] According to the Henan Daily news on March 20th: In order to understand the true burden of industrial and commercial tax and to investigate whether it is indeed heavy, the Kaifeng Municipal Tax Bureau dispatched 36 cadres on the 7th of this month, carrying inspection certificates, and in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, carried out surprise audits with a focus.

    Among the 21 households in 11 industries audited this time, it was found that 80% had false accounts, and some businesses even had more than two sets of false accounts. For example, Tongfeng Department Store in the department store industry initially produced two sets of false accounts on two occasions during the inspection. It was not until a purchase ledger and some letters and receipts related to goods entering and leaving the store were found in a hat box on a counter shelf that the store admitted to having genuine accounts. Shunxingzhen Silk and Cloth also initially produced a set of false accounts. Later, when the store’s "diary" and "unaccounted slips" (i.e., slips that had not been entered into the accounts) for goods arriving from Shanghai were found in the gap of the interior wall of the store’s counter and in a pile of messy papers, the store admitted to having false accounts, but excused themselves by claiming that "the real accounts were burned," and refused to hand them over. Some merchants used various methods to hide their account books, attempting to evade and refuse inspection. For example, "Jixingjiu" Department Store stuffed its account books into a hole in the wall, covering it with calligraphy and paintings; Fuyuan Grocery Store hid its account books on the ceiling and under the bedding; but they complained that the tax bureau cadres "should not rummage through boxes and cabinets." Others (such as Yixinglong in the porcelain and iron industry, and Xietai Chang in Xiangguo Temple) threw their account books out of the window or took them outside to tear them up.

    A small number of law-abiding businesses with genuine and accurate accounts readily produced their account books and assisted the tax bureau cadres in the inspection. For example, Shanhe Bookstore and Yufeng Department Store took out their real accounts from the beginning; Taihe Pharmacy and Huayang Pharmacy also proactively explained that the two sets of accounts, when viewed together, formed a complete account. These law-abiding merchants believe that the tax bureau’s audit is completely correct and necessary. They hope that the government will give due punishment to those illegal merchants who fabricate false accounts in an attempt to evade taxes.

    The materials obtained from this audit are sufficient to demonstrate that the industrial and commercial tax in Kaifeng is not heavy, and that some businesses have not paid the tax they should have paid. For example, the Southern Paper Industry was previously the most vocal in claiming that "taxes are heavy," but this audit has powerfully proven that this "claim" is incorrect. For example, when inspecting the accounts of Yumaonan Paper Store, it was found that most of the goods were not recorded in the accounts. Last year, four boxes of stationery, a printing press, a set of printing type, and a portion of ink and newsprint that came from Shanghai were not entered into the accounts. However, even based on his false accounts, the store’s total industrial and commercial tax burden last year was only 2.1% of the total turnover. Similarly, Liji in the pigment industry accounted for only 1.8%. Shops that make false accounts generally conceal a great deal. For example, Shunxingzhen Silk and Cloth concealed fifty boxes of dyes, forty-seven boxes of batteries, and dozens of enamelware and fabrics that arrived last November. The difference between the true and false purchase accounts of Tongfeng Department Store was more than half. For example, the genuine account of June 11th last year recorded: "Purchased five dozen flowered socks." But the false account only recorded two dozen.

    In the genuine accounts found in this audit, the general burden accounts for about 5% of turnover, and there are some cases of disproportionately light or heavy burdens. For example, the burden of Shanhe Bookstore in the winter and autumn seasons last year accounted for only 0.98% of its total turnover. The annual burden of Taihe Pharmacy accounted for 4.2% of its total annual turnover, Huayang Pharmacy accounted for 4.4%, and Yufeng Department Store accounted for 6.1%. Based on these circumstances, the Municipal Tax Bureau is currently studying how to handle the situation.

### 经税务局突击查账后  开封查获假账漏税  事实证明工商业税并不重

　　经税务局突击查账后
    开封查获假账漏税
    事实证明工商业税并不重
    【本报讯】据三月二十日河南日报消息：开封市税务局为了解工商税真实负担情况，以考察究竟重不重的问题，曾于本月七日，抽调三十六名干部，携带检查证，会同公安局，有重点的实行突击查账。
    在这次查到的十一业二十一户中，发现百分之八十是假账，有些商号的假账甚至竟多到两套以上。如百货业同丰百货商店，在开始检查时，两次拿出两套假账，直到在该店内柜房的货架上的帽盒内查出一本进货账和一些有关进出货物的信件、单据等时，该店才承认有真账。绸布业顺兴振开始时也拿出一套假账，后来，在该店柜房内墙隙中和乱纸堆中找出该店的自上海来货的“日记本”和“未账底”（即没有登账的底子）时，该店也才承认是假账，但却借口“真账烧了”，不肯交出。部分商人以各种方法隐藏账本，企图逃避拒绝检查。如百货业“极星久”把账簿塞在墙洞内，用字画遮着；复元杂货庄把账簿藏在顶棚上和床褥下；但他们反称税局干部“不应该翻箱倒柜”。另有一些商人（如瓷铁业义兴隆、相国寺协泰长），却把账簿从窗口中扔出去，或带到室外撕掉。
    少数守法真正账目确实的商号，则都很坦然地很快的把账簿拿出来，帮助税局干部检查。如山河书店、裕丰百货商店，一开始就把真账拿出来；太和药房和华洋药房也都主动说明：两套账合起来看，是一部完全的账。这些守法商人，他们认为：税局的查账是完全正确而且是必要的。他们希望政府对于那些捏造假账企图逃税的非法商人，给以应得的处罚。
    从这次查账所获得的材料中，已能够充分说明：开封市的工商税是不重的，而且部分商号并没有纳到他应纳的税额。如南纸业是过去叫喊“税重”最厉害的一业，但在这次查账中，却有力地证明了这种“叫喊”是不正确的。如豫茂南纸店，在查到他的账目时，竟大部分货物都没有记账。去年，他从上海来的四箱文具，一部印刷机，一套铅字和一部分油墨、新闻纸等都没有入账。可是，就依他的假账计算，去年该店全部工商税负担，也不过占营业总额的百分之二点一。类似这样情况的，还有颜料业利记仅占百分之一点八，造假账的商店，一般隐瞒极大，如绸布业顺兴振，去年十一月来的五十箱颜料、四十七箱电池和数十件搪瓷，布匹等都没有入账。同丰百货商店的真进货账与假进货账则悬殊一半以上。如该店去年六月十一日的真账中记：“进花菜女袜五打。”而假账中却只记两打。
    在这次查到的真账中，一般的负担约占营业额的百分之五左右，部分的也有畸轻畸重现象。如山河书店去年冬秋两季的负担仅占其营业总额的百分之○点九八，太和药房的全年负担，占其全年营业总额的百分之四点二，华阳药房占百分之四点四，裕丰百货商店则占百分之六点一。根据这些情况，市税局正在研究处理中。
