To the Editor:

　　On the afternoon of the 25th of this month, I went to the Beijing Department Store on Wangfujing Street to buy something. Before leaving, due to a moment of carelessness, I lost 50,000 yuan in banknotes on the glass counter of the company. Afterwards, I returned to the original place to inquire, and I was grateful to the salespersons Li Weijun and Bao Xiling for safekeeping it. In order to be cautious and avoid any unexpected events, they expressed their willingness to continue to keep it for another day. Finally, on the afternoon of the 26th, the money was returned to me intact.

　　保管顾客丢失的钞票
    李伟君包锡玲值得表扬编辑先生：
    在本月二十五日的下午，我到王府井大街北京百货公司去买东西，临走的时候，因一时疏忽，把五万元的钞票丢在该公司的玻璃柜台上。事后回到原处询找，承蒙营业员李伟君、包锡玲二同志代为保管，他们为了慎重避免发生意外情事起见，表示愿意再继续保管一天，终于二十六日下午，该款便原封退还本人了。 北大宋钟铭  三月二十七日
