Xinhua News Agency, 30th - A crisis has recently occurred in the Vietnamese Bảo Đại puppet government, which is supported by American and French imperialism. According to a report from the Electric Communications Agency: the "ministers" of Defense and Education, along with the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the Bảo Đại "government" resigned on the 25th. The three resigning "ministers", who are extremely right-wing and pro-American, expressed their dissatisfaction in a letter to Bảo Đại, stating that the "government" had not implemented even a single one of their plans, and that they had "done nothing for the reconstruction of the 'nation'". On the 27th, pro-government newspapers in Paris expressed great unease about the crisis in the Bảo Đại puppet government. In a special article, the semi-official Parisian newspaper "Le Monde" also reflected the anxiety of French officials regarding Bảo Đại's "failure to live up to expectations".

　　保大“政府”发生危机
    亲美“部长”辞职
    【新华社三十日讯】美、法帝国主义所扶植的越南保大傀儡政府，最近发生危机。据电通社报道：保大“政府”中的国防、教育部长与外交部副部长，已于二十五日辞职。属于极端右倾和亲美的三个辞职“部长”，在给保大的信中表示他们的不满称，“政府”对他们的计划甚至一点也未能实行，而且“对于‘国家’的重建毫无所为”。二十七日，巴黎各亲政府报纸对保大傀儡政府的危机甚感不安。巴黎半官方的《世界报》在一篇专文里，也反映了法国官方对保大“不孚众望”的不安。
