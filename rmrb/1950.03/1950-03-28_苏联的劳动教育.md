Soviet Labor Education

I. The Significance of Labor in Communist Education

Socialist society is built on the solid foundation of emancipated, creative, and highly productive physical and intellectual labor. In the Soviet Union, labor is the sacred duty of every citizen, and at the same time a glorious, courageous, and honorable undertaking. "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work" – this is the basic law of socialism. Each citizen's individual ability and individual labor determine his position in society. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, the most important task of educating and nurturing the growing generation is to train them to engage in glorious, organized, and fruitful labor for the happiness of the socialist motherland.

A.C. Makarenko emphasized: "Correct Soviet education, if it is a non-labor education, is unimaginable... In educational work, labor should be one of the most fundamental components."

To educate students in and for labor means: to cultivate their love and respect for labor; to train their ability and habits to work in a planned and tenacious manner; to form a conscious socialist attitude towards labor; to cultivate a certain degree of practical labor experience; to enable students to understand the basic knowledge of modern production and technology in industry and agriculture; to teach young students to value the constructive labor of the Soviet people, both physical and intellectual, to encourage them to participate in labor as much as possible, and to study and prepare enthusiastically for future labor activities.

Labor has educational significance and plays a significant role in the development of students' physical and moral strength, and in the formation of the entire moral outlook, will, and character of a growing person.

In the process of labor, one can exercise the body, cultivate the spirit of perseverance, diligence, indomitable will, and discipline, and develop the ability to use time in a planned and economical way, and to work rationally and in an organized manner.

Suitable, conscious, and creative labor (intellectual and physical) can provide satisfaction and joy due to the achieved results, and make the energy and tension used by a person pleasant. Rest after such labor is a true pleasure and a source of motivation for new activities. Therefore, labor is the best means to prevent and overcome apathy, negativity, and laziness.

Labor elevates a person's moral sentiments, makes him accustomed to carefully treating labor instruments, tools, and products, valuing books and other items of spiritual and material culture, respecting laborers of any occupation, and hating parasites, exploiters, idlers, cowards, and dandies. In the process of collective intellectual labor in schools, suitable participation in social work, and various types of labor cooperation in school-adjacent plots, laboratories, and practice factories, comradeship-like mutual relations and friendship between students occur and develop, and the characteristics of collectivism are cultivated.

The significance of labor's moral education has long been recognized by the most famous classical scholars in educational science and was particularly emphasized by the great Russian educator K.D. Ushinsky.

His educational legacy contains specialized scientific research on this issue. But Ushinsky had the illusion that only "truly and indeed free labor" could "serve as the source of human value," and therefore, it is an irreplaceable means of moral education. Ushinsky's progressive illusions can only be realized under the conditions of eliminating human exploitation. Only under the conditions of socialist society, in the Soviet communist education system, did labor obtain its true educational significance in the formation of the personality of a growing person.

II. Methods and Means of Labor Education in Schools

The beginning of labor education should start long before children enter school – from an early age, children become interested in various kinds of labor around them and are willing to help adults in family life, which is reflected in children's play. This natural desire of children to engage in labor activities they can do must be encouraged and developed as much as possible.

Under the correct educational equipment of the family and early childhood education institutions, children can learn to independently complete various suitable tasks, such as taking care of themselves, drawing, sculpting, making very simple toys and other products with paper, cardboard, and wood. Children must be thoroughly accustomed to tidying up their own space, folding bedding, caring for indoor flowers and plants, wiping dust, mopping floors, sweeping snow on roads near the house, and so on.

Cultivating children's spirit of labor autonomy, introducing them to people's labor activities in an amiable manner, inspiring them to respect adults' labor, and teaching them to cherish their clothes, food, and other things created by human labor, then a solid foundation for labor education is laid.

Labor Education in the School Learning Process

With children's entry into school, a new and particularly important stage of their labor education begins.

Learning is the basic labor activity of school-age children. Therefore, teaching is the main means of educating students with the necessary labor qualities. However, this will only happen if teachers consciously and skillfully use classroom and extracurricular assignments for this purpose.

Lessons that cannot prompt all students to pay close attention to the progress of the assignment and actively participate in it, and that cannot awaken and cultivate students' thinking, may cause students to be passive and generate indiscipline.

The content of school teaching and extracurricular educational work itself, in its ideological direction, should promote the formation of correct labor views, inspire students' deep respect for laborers, and the desire for labor.

In order to cultivate students' learning and labor views, the connection between what is being learned and life should be revealed concretely and appropriately from the very beginning. Children of all ages have a great interest in life.

Some courses, such as botany, physics, and chemistry, their school progress plans and teaching methods, should stipulate in advance that students theoretically and practically understand the general principles of technology and modern agricultural and industrial production technology. The correct arrangement of teaching the above subjects should plan to hold excursions and visits with students: to nearby farms, agricultural machinery stations, power stations, factories, manufacturing plants, and organize students' practical work in laboratories, practice factories, and fields. All of this helps to solve the tasks of technical education in schools and is an integral part of students' labor education.

Throughout the entire teaching process, efforts should be made to explain the conscious and creative labor that the Soviet people are realizing in all fields of socialist construction, in order to arouse children's desire to become complete inheritors of the great cause. Using the advanced workers of our country as examples, tell the children how heroes are made and how the future heroic qualities are cultivated from childhood in the process of tenacious labor.

When arming students with knowledge of a subject, children should be made aware of the lives and activities of the hard workers in that science, who are models of tenacious and tireless labor.

Along with the cultivation of the recognition of the importance of labor, the ability and habit of normal labor must also be cultivated, and the ability to use effort must be cultivated.

The correct combination of interest and effort in teaching and education can be achieved by applying methods such as keeping children in a state of active mental and volitional tension and not allowing them to grasp the essence of a subject superficially. Discovery methods, experimental methods, students' self-study, and laboratory work – these methods are very important for developing students' initiative.

In connection with the cultivation of effort, attention should also be paid to the significance of the teacher's ability to attract the whole class in class, and not just individual students, to be active, which is very important.

Homework given to students to do at home, which is almost every lesson, can become an irreplaceable means of systematically training every student's effort and cultivating labor habits if they are arranged correctly. However, for this, it is necessary to estimate the possibility of students handling their homework independently, and to have a correct allocation of family courses. Homework that is too easy, which a student can complete without any tension and effort, and homework that is too difficult, which is obviously beyond his ability, will undermine students' interest in work and their trust in their own strength – these are equally inappropriate from the point of view of labor education.

When the teacher understands each of his students and adopts individual methods for students in the teaching process, the teacher may often propose appropriate topics, teaching materials with appropriate content and weight, which students need to overcome, although it requires very intense effort, but does not exceed his potential possibilities.

Excessive workload causes excessive tension of strength, which produces an unpleasant situation of extreme fatigue during work; from this point, a strong stimulus arises, which can turn into aversion to work and laziness over time.

According to the degree of ability that students have gained to handle certain homework independently, homework can be gradually complicated in content and gradually increased in quantity.

Regularly and strictly checking the completion of students' homework at home, taking care of the efforts and enthusiasm shown by students in order to achieve certain results, giving a fair and objective evaluation of students' work, is an indispensable condition for systematically training students in diligence, hard work, and labor habits.

The most important thing is to cultivate students' habits of working in a planned, daily, non-skipping, non-slackening, non-impulsive manner.

It is often seen that students can sometimes show extraordinary effort in a very short period of time, but they are not accustomed to systematic labor. Such students can "diligently" study for exams and "compensate" for the entire year's neglect in order to obtain satisfactory or good grades, but they cannot engage in systematic labor.

If the teacher only calls on the student to answer once or twice in a semester, and does not ask him in the remaining time, allowing him to be at ease, then this gives lazy students the full possibility to do nothing when not called on, and he cannot get used to working normally on a daily basis. If parents do not pay attention to students' preparation of homework at home, and teachers do not often check or do not fully check all students' homework at home, then this equally gives some students the opportunity to "slack off" again and again, and this can easily turn into the bad habit of shock work.

The task is: by relying on the interest and initiative of the inspired children, to thoroughly educate them in the school years and cultivate their valuable habits of constant effort, systematic work, and daily organized labor.

Labor habits are one of the most important prerequisites for creative labor. A.C. Makarenko correctly said: "Creative labor is only possible when the deep-rooted habits of labor effort have been cultivated, and when any work will not be considered unpleasant (if there is some meaning in the work). Those who treat work with fear, those who are afraid of feeling effort, are completely impossible to have creative labor..." And in our socialist country, any labor can and must be creative.

Students Participate in Physical Labor Suitably

Within the limits of their strength and possibilities, and in complete consistency with the school's teaching tasks, students should, in connection with taking care of their own lives, studies, and students' public affairs, participate suitably in various possible physical labor – at home, at school, in the Young Pioneers, and in the Youth League organization.

In order to realize the connection between teaching and life, for students to apply the knowledge they have gained to practice, to cultivate the ability and habits to use simple tools, and the ability and habits to perform the basic forms of manual labor, to teach children to work not only with their brains, but also with their hands – various practical operations should be carried out in the school's laboratory, on the school-adjacent fields, in technical groups, manual and home economics groups, and school factories, or in specially equipped workshops. Many teachers of various subjects (language and literature, history, geography, biology, physics, etc.) should successfully attract students to make self-made teaching aids – charts, maps, models, sculptures, various instruments, collections, specimens, and so on. Students help repair all the school's physical teaching aids and teaching equipment with their own labor, repair and bind books in the school library, help the school with electrification and radio equipment, equipment necessary for travel and sports equipment, repair school premises, paint desks and blackboards in summer, decorate classrooms, sew curtains and awnings, make frames for portraits and pictures, green the area near the school, build sports fields, set up gardens near the school, and so on.

In many schools, outside of the learning plan, in the form of considerable groups and other extracurricular activities, the interests and hobbies of individual students can be taken care of, and conditions can be created to organize students' work with various labor forms – such as thick paper work and binding work, woodworking and fitter work, sewing, several kinds of agricultural labor, electrical technology, radio technology, and so on.

Within the scope of possibility, workshops or factories suitable for simple woodworking and preliminary metal processing and electrical technology work need to be established inside (or near) the school.

General education schools cannot and should not take training students in a certain profession within a certain labor sector as their task. However, the practical labor operations organized within the school with the general purpose of general education should be carried out under the guidance of teachers or appropriate technical teachers, according to a certain plan and program, and should take into account the age possibilities of the students, connect them with the knowledge they have acquired in the school, and arm them with the minimum labor skills.

Schools should encourage children to participate suitably in family life labor at home, but at the same time, do not allow individual students (often girls) to be overly burdened with family obligations that affect their studies. The minimum and most necessary daily life work, tidying up beds and rooms, washing dishes, heating food, etc. – does not require too much time, and it is necessary for every member of the laboring family to do it. Parents should be told about the educational significance of attracting children to take care of their own lives. It is absolutely not permissible for Soviet students to despise "rough work," to escape it themselves, or for parents not to allow them to engage in the labor obligations of daily life at home, and to become idlers. In future independent life – in life, in further study after graduating from middle school, in production, in the army – the skills of taking care of one's own clothes and preparing simple food, etc., are beneficial to students. Regarding the labor of trivial matters of life as the responsibility and fate of women in society, as "petty things" is one of the harmful prejudices produced by the capitalist system and the status of women in bourgeois society.

Krupskaya said in her own essay "Should Boys Be Taught to Do 'Petty Things?'": "Boys and girls should both learn everything that is economically necessary, and do not think that doing this is not worthy of themselves."

Of course, here we cannot ignore the natural differences and characteristics of students of different genders in family labor. Boys are willing to do things that are heavier in life labor, such as: chopping wood, making stoves, fetching water, and so on. Girls are suitable for life labor that requires precision, careful decoration, and aesthetic flair. However, this division of labor is very relative. The youth of both sexes in Soviet schools should have "skilled hands," practically understand life's "trivia," be good at adapting to any material conditions at home, on the road, and in new places, and should not feel helpless and have an unwarranted fear of inconvenience for an independent person.

Students Participate in Socially Beneficial Labor

In the work of students' labor education, their suitable participation in various socially beneficial productive labor and social work has special significance.

In the years of the Great Patriotic War, the students of our schools, young Soviet patriots, completed many important socially beneficial undertakings: participating in agricultural labor, helping collective farms, collecting metal objects and useful wild plants, helping the families of front-line workers, helping hospitals, participating suitably in air defense work, and so on. The experience of the school's work in these years of our people's great test and heroic feats proves how great the ideological and educational significance of socially beneficial labor is for students. In peacetime, socially beneficial labor should also be carried out in other ways, in a way that is completely subordinate to the school's teaching tasks.

Students participate in various socially beneficial undertakings through the Young Pioneers and Youth League organizations in the school. Such as the collection of wild edible foods and medicinal plants, the extermination of pests in collective farm fields, the capture of birds, afforestation, etc., these socially beneficial labors have been widely developed in schools. The students of our schools do their best to help collective farms harvest during the summer vacation. The students of schools help rural reading rooms, district cultural palaces, district local museums, nearby libraries, and other cultural and educational institutions. During the election period of Soviet power organs, recreational activities are carried out in various constituencies. Schools organize ski propaganda teams and other propaganda teams in nearby residents in connection with current political movements. Students conduct meteorological observations in meteorological stations near their schools under the guidance of teachers, study the soil and natural resources of the region in the local soil groups of their schools, and engage in selection and other work in the experimental areas of young museum groups; and at the same time, use the results of their observations to serve the surrounding residents, improve the harvest of local fields, vegetable gardens, and orchards, and improve local industry.

Young Pioneers among students organize "Timur teams," volunteering every day to provide the necessary life services for the families of Soviet soldiers and guerrillas who sacrificed in the battles for the freedom and independence of our motherland, as well as for the families of those who were disabled in the Patriotic War. Young Pioneers among students assist the work of nurseries, playgrounds, and children's palaces. In these places, the Soviet government educates the children of parents who died at the hands of brutal fascist bandits with special care. Young Pioneers among students also collect books for children, make toys, set up cheerful fir trees, and so on.

Students in Soviet schools participate in various socially beneficial labors with great enthusiasm. We cultivate in children the habit of contributing their strength, knowledge, and skills for the benefit of society, thereby cultivating their love for labor and their practical habits for social work. However, this is only meaningful when socially beneficial labor is properly organized and educationally purposeful.

Organizing students' socially beneficial labor should start from the basic and principled point of view, which is that it should be subordinate to the tasks of teaching and education in schools.

When choosing socially beneficial labors that students of all grades can participate in, the age characteristics of their physical and intellectual development, and the level of their social awareness should be taken into account. It should be ensured that the work performed by the children is completely suitable, interesting, and recognizable for them.

Participating in socially beneficial labor should promote the comprehensive development of students – physical, intellectual, and moral.

Protecting and consolidating students' health and caring for their physical development should not be manifested in the establishment of "warm" conditions and pampering and spoiling children. On the contrary, children's physical strength is exercised in labor. This exercise method is rational, consistent training, gradual adaptation to any weather and environment, and practice in performing various labors.

Students' socially beneficial labor should have educational significance, should promote students to apply the knowledge they have gained in school to practice, promote the expansion of horizons, the increase of beneficial knowledge, and intellectual development.

When organizing students' socially beneficial labor, one must be good at combining the collective principles in work with the enthusiasm of each participant's individual efforts.

Students' social work should be carried out according to a well-thought-out plan. This plan should be explained to the participants, or formulated with them, so that everyone can understand it. Social groups should summarize and evaluate the work done, and inform the collective of this summary and evaluation, in order to develop students' social activities and improve the quality of their future socially beneficial labor.

Socially beneficial labor should not only rely on "activists" in schools; it should absorb as many students as possible in various age-acceptable degrees and ways.

Labor and Discipline

Cultivating students' socialist labor attitude means cultivating their conscious labor discipline and cultivating their sense of responsibility for fulfilling their learning obligations and social obligations. The older the students, the higher this sense of responsibility should be, and the stricter the labor discipline should be.

In an environment lacking daily and strict control, in an environment where students escape the prescribed requirements and are not punished for slackening their obligations, phenomena of irresponsibility, laziness, leisure, and idleness are easy to appear. If a student has not been working well, does not work hard, hopes for "luck," and only "talks" with him endlessly, sends a classmate to help him, and conducts chronic "supplementary assignments" with him, without taking effective measures to force him to work, this will have a negative and bad influence on those students who violate learning obligations and the surrounding students.

Labor education in schools means making students accustomed to voluntarily and conscientiously completing the work they have done (academic and social) and making them accustomed to stubbornly overcoming the difficulties they encounter. To achieve this, only the teachers, principals, Young Pioneer leaders, and students' social organizations of the school very carefully pay attention to the execution of the work undertaken by each student, require them to complete it within the specified time with a certain quality, fairly evaluate each completed work, and at the same time strictly rebuke that dishonest and irresponsible situation. In the most serious situation, such as some students' indiscipline in work damaging the collective's credibility, or possibly disrupting major public measures, the collective's public opinion should be used to severely criticize such wrongdoers.

On the one hand, the initiative peculiar to our children, teenagers, and young students, and the constant desire to love activities, and on the other hand, the glorious position that labor occupies in the Soviet Union – this creates many very good conditions for students' labor education. Therefore, Makarenko's principle is completely correct. He does not advocate taking certain reward and punishment measures within the scope of labor. He said: "The labor task and its solution should itself satisfy children and make them feel happy. Recognizing his work as excellent work is the best reward for his labor." This is an ideal topic to strive for: to make labor itself attract students and stimulate their initiative. When a public opinion is established in the collective surrounding labor (academic and social), labor becomes a means of public recognition. In the practice of schools, it is well known that there are many occasions: absorbing a student to engage in a certain public obligation in the collective, entrusting him with a certain public task – this is the best means of expressing recognition, and at the same time gives him a good influence.

In schools, labor should be raised to such a height that depriving a student who is negligent of his academic and social obligations of the task of social labor assigned to him and the glorious right to participate in the execution of a certain socially beneficial undertaking can be used as one of the effective punishment measures for him. The experience of the educational work of the outstanding Soviet educator Makarenko and many advanced teachers in our schools proves the great effectiveness of this educational influence method, and the condition is to organize appropriate public opinion in the student collective.

In this way, the formation of communist labor views of students throughout the entire teaching process; the combination of interest and effort in learning; the correct organization of students' independent work; the carrying out of academic and extracurricular practical operations that cultivate students' practical labor skills and habits; the stimulation of students' labor effort and initiative in the daily intellectual and physical labor of schools, families, and social groups; the adoption of systematic supervision and objective evaluation of the execution of all work; the cultivation of students' habits of normal and organized labor; the establishment of public opinion in the student collective on the issue of labor discipline and social obligations; the reward of creative independence; the initiative of students in any kind of work – these are the basic methods and means of students' labor education in Soviet schools, and also the basic methods and means of training them to engage in creative productive labor as worthy citizens of the Soviet state in the future.

　　苏联的劳动教育
    一、劳动在共产主义教育中的意义
    社会主义社会是建筑在解除了剥削的、创造性的、高度生产的体力劳动和智力劳动的牢固基础之上的。在苏联，劳动是每一个公民的神圣义务，同时又是光荣、勇敢、荣誉的事业。“各尽所能，按劳取值”——这便是社会主义的基本法则。每一个公民的个人能力和个人劳动决定他在社会上的地位。因此，在苏联，教育和培养正在成长着的一代之最重大的任务，就是训练他们为了去从事光荣的、有组织的、有成果的劳动，以谋社会主义祖国的幸福。
    Ａ·Ｃ·马卡连科曾强调说：“正确的苏维埃教育，如果是一种非劳动的教育乃是不能想像的……在教育工作中，劳动应当是最基本的成分之一。”
    在劳动中和为劳动而教育学生，这意味着：要培养他们对于劳动的爱好与尊敬；锻炼他们有计划地及坚韧地工作之能力与习惯；形成自觉的社会主义的劳动态度，培养他们一定限度的实际劳动的经验；使学生们认识在工业和农业中现代生产和技术的基本知识；教导青年学生们重视苏维埃人民的体力和智力的建设性的劳动，使他们尽力参加劳动，热心学习和准备从事未来的劳动活动。
    劳动具有教育的意义，并在学生们的体力和道德力量的发展中，在一个正在成长着的人的全部道德面貌、意志和性格的形成中起着很大的作用。
    在劳动的过程中，能锻炼身体，培养坚忍、刻苦、不屈不挠、遵守纪律的精神，造成善于有计划地和经济地利用时间，合理地和有组织地去工作。
    适力的、有意识的、创造性的劳动（智力的与体力的），可以因达到的结果而得到满足、提供一种欢乐，并使一个人所使用的精力和紧张成为愉快的事。这样一种劳动之后的休息，乃是一种真正的快乐和新的活动动机的源泉。因此，劳动乃是防止和克服无生气、消极、怠惰现象的最好手段。
    劳动使一个人的道德情感变得高尚，使他惯于小心地对待劳动的器具、工具和生产品，重视书籍以及其他精神文化和物质文化的物品，尊重任何一种职业的劳动者，仇视那些寄生虫和剥削者、游手好闲的人、懦夫和花花公子。学校里集体智力劳动、适力地参加社会工作，学校附近地亩上、实验室和实习工厂里各种类型劳动合作等之过程中，便发生并发展学生之间的同志般的相互关系和友爱，便养成集体主义的特质。
    劳动的道德教育的意义，早经教育科学中最著名的古典学者们所承认，而且为伟大的俄罗斯教育学家Ｋ·Ｄ·乌申斯基所特别着重地强调过。
    他的教育学的遗著中，对于这个问题，有专门的科学研究。但乌申斯基曾幻想，只有“真正而确实自由的劳动”，才能“作为人类价值的源泉”，因之，它是道德教育之不可更易的手段。乌申斯基这些进步的幻想，只有在消灭了人剥削人的条件之下，才能实现。劳动在社会主义社会的条件下，在苏维埃共产主义教育制度中，方获得了自己在一个成长着的人的个性形成中的真实的教育的意义。
            二、学校中劳动教育的方法和手段
    劳动教育的端绪，远在儿童入学以前便应当有了，——儿童从幼年起就对于周围的各种各样的劳动发生兴趣，愿在家庭生活中帮助成人，这反映在儿童的玩耍中。儿童的这种想从事自己可以作的劳动活动之天然愿望，必须尽力地予以鼓励和发展。
    在家庭及幼稚教育机关的正确的教育设备之下，儿童可以学会独立地完成各种适力的工作，诸如照看自己、描画、塑型、用纸、纸板、木头制造极简单的玩具和其他制品。要彻底地使小孩子惯于整理自己的地方，铺折被褥，照护室内的花木，揩拭尘埃，擦地板，打扫房屋附近道路上的积雪以及其他等等。
    培养儿童的劳动的自动精神，以和蔼可亲的方式使他认识人们的劳动活动，启发他尊敬成人的劳动，教导他爱护自己的衣服、食品及其他凡人类的劳动所创造的东西，这时劳动教育的坚固基础便奠立起来了。
            学校学习过程中的劳动教育
    随着儿童的入学，他的劳动教育的一个新的和特别重要的阶段便开始了。
    学习是学龄儿童的基本的劳动活动。因此，教学就是教育学生以必要的劳动品质之主要手段。但是，这只有在教师有意识地并技巧地利用课堂作业及课外作业于此目的的场合，才会发生作用。
    不能促使全体学生非常注意地注视作业进程并积极地参加其中的功课，不能唤醒和培养学生思想的功课，便可能引起学生消极，产生无纪律性。
    学校教学和课外教育工作的内容本身，在其思想方向上应当促使正确的劳动观点之养成，启示学生对劳动者的深深尊敬以及劳动愿望。
    为了培养学生这样的学习观点和劳动观点，应当从第一步起便具体地适当地在他们面前揭开所学习的东西与生活之联系。儿童在各个年龄阶段中对于生活都有极大的兴趣。
    有些课程，如像植物学、物理、化学，它们的学校进度计划和教授法，应预先规定在理论和实践上使学生认识工艺学和现代农业及工业生产技术之一般原理。上述各项科目的教学之正确布置，要预定同学生一块举行游览参观：到附近的农场、到农业机器站、电力站、工厂、制造厂，并组织学生们在实验室、实习工厂及田地里的实习作业。所有这一切都有助于解决学校中工艺教育的任务，而是学生劳动教育的一个组成部分。
    在全部教学的过程中，应当竭力说明苏维埃人民在社会主义建设的一切领域中正在实现的自觉的和创造性的劳动，以唤起儿童们的成为伟大事业的完备继承者之热望。应当以我们国家的先进的劳动者为例，告诉孩子们，英雄是怎样长成的，未来的英雄特质，是如何从童年起，在顽强的劳动过程中养成的。
    在以某科目的智识来武装学生们的时候，应当使孩子们认识该种科学中的勤劳者的生活和活动，他们乃是顽强及不疲倦的劳动的模范。
    随着劳动重要性认识的养成，还必须培养正常劳动的才能与习惯，培养使用努力的才能。
    应用这样一些方法，比如使儿童保持思想和意志积极紧张的状况，不容许浮光掠影地表面地把握某科目之本质，就可以做到教学和教育中兴趣与努力的正确结合。发见法，试验方法，学生们的自修，实验室作业——这些方法，对于发展学生的积极性都是非常重要的。
    与培养努力相联系，也要注意到教师在上课时吸引全班，而不仅只是个别学生积极活动之能力的意义，这是很重要的。
    给学生回家作的功课，几乎每课都有，如能将它们正确地布置，则这可能成为有系统地训练每一个学生努力和培养劳动习惯之不可代换的手段。但是，为了这，需要估计学生独立自主地处理功课的可能性，而对家庭课程有正确的调配。过分容易的功课，一个学生不需要任何紧张努力就可以完成，另外，过分难的，显然是力不能胜的功课，将会破坏学生们对于工作的兴趣和对于自己力量的信任——从劳动教育的观点来看，这些同样都是不妥的。
    教师了解自己的每一个学生，并在教学过程中对于学生采用个别的办法，这么一来，教师便可能常常提出适当的课目，具有适当的内容与分量的教学材料，学生为了克服它，虽需要非常的紧张努力，但并不超过他的潜在的可能性。
    过度的负荷引起力量之过分紧张，就产生工作时的极度疲倦的不愉快情形；从这一点就会产生一种强烈的刺激，这种刺激随着时间的流转便能转为厌恶工作，懒惰。
    按照学生所获得独立处理一定功课的能力之程度，功课可在内容上渐渐复杂，而且分量上渐渐增大。
    正规而严格地检查学生家内功课的完成情形，照顾学生为了取得一定成绩而作的努力和所表现的热心，对于学生的工作给以公正而客观的评价，这就是有系统的训练学生们用功，勤劳、劳动习惯之不可缺少的条件。
    最主要的，就是培养学生们有计划地、逐日地，不跳跃，不松懈，不冲动地工作的习惯。
    常常可以看到：学生们有时候能够在很短的时间内表现出非常的努力，然而，对于有系统的劳动，却不习惯。这样的学生，能够在临考之前“孜孜”于功课，能够“补偿”整个一年来所疏忽了的，以取得满意的或者是很好的评定，但是他们却不能够有系统地从事劳动。
    假如教师在一季内只召唤学生回答一两次，而在其余的时间，并不去问他，听其安然自在，那么，这就给懒惰的学生以充分的可能，使他在非召唤的时候什么都不做，而他也不能习于正常地逐日地工作。假若家长在家里不注意学生们准备功课，而教师们又不时常检查或不全部检查所有学生们在家庭中的作业，那么，这同样地给其中若干学生一次再一次地“偷懒”的机会，而且这会很容易地转变成突击工作的恶劣习惯。
    任务是在于：借凭所启发的儿童的兴趣和积极性，以彻底的教育的方法，在学校中学习的年代中，养成他们经常努力，有系统地做事的珍贵的习惯，进行日常的有组织的劳动的习惯。
    劳动习惯乃是创造性劳动的一个最重要的前提。Ａ·Ｃ·马卡连科完全正确地说：“创造性的劳动，只有在劳动努力的深固习惯已经养成的时候，在任何工作不会被认为是不愉快的时候（若工作中有着某种意思），才是可能的。那些对待工作怀着畏惧的人，那些害怕努力感觉的人，是完全不可能有创造性的劳动的……”而在我们社会主义国家内，任何劳动都可能而必须是创造性的。
            学生们适力地参加体力劳动
    学生们在自己的力量和可能性的限度之内以及在与学校的教学任务完全一致的情形下，应当与照顾自己生活，与学业，与学生的公共事业相联系，适力地参加各种各样可能作的体力劳动——在家里，在学校里，在少年先锋队里，在青年团组织里。
    为了实现教学与生活之间的连系，为了学生们应用所得知识于实践，为了培养使用简单工具的能力与习惯以及执行手工劳动基本形式的能力与习惯，为了教给儿童们不仅用脑力，而且用双手工作，——这就应当在校内实验室中，在学校附近田地上，在技术小组，手工和家政小组及学校工厂或者是在特别装设的工作间中，从事各种实习的作业。各种科目（语文及文学、历史、地理、生物、物理及其他）的许多教员，应当成功地吸引学生们去制作自造的教具——图表、地图、模型、塑型、各种仪器、采集、标本及其他等等。学生们以自身的劳动来帮助修理学校所有的实物教具和教学设备，修理和装订学校图书馆的书籍，帮助学校电气化和无线电装备，旅行所必需的设备及运动器具，修理学校处所，在夏季油漆课桌及黑板，装饰教室，缝制窗帘和帐子，制造画像和图片的框架，绿化学校附近地区，建设运动场，在学校附近布置花园及其他等等。
    在很多学校里，可以在学习计划以外，以相当的小组及其他种课外校外活动的方式，照顾个别学生的兴趣和嗜好，造成用各种劳动形式组织学生作业的条件——如用厚纸工和装订工、木工和钳工、缝纫、若干种农业劳动、电工技术、无线电技术等等。
    在可能范围之内，校内（或学校附近）需要建立工作间或适于作简单木工和初步金属加工，电工技术工作的工厂。
    普通教育学校不能而且也不应当把在一定劳动部门内训练学生某种职业作为自己的任务。但是，校内所组织的抱着一般普通教育目的的实习劳动作业，应当在教师或适当的技术教师指导之下，按照一定的计划和纲领进行，并应当照顾到学生们的年龄的可能性，联系他们在学校中所获得的知识，而以最小限度的劳动技能武装他们。
    学校应当鼓励儿童在家庭里，适力地参加家庭的生活劳动，但同时不要让个别学生（常常是女孩子们）过度担负家中的义务而影响学习。最小限度的最必需的日常生活工作，整理床铺及房间、洗涤食具、煮热食物等等，——不需要过多时间，而对于劳动的家庭的每一个成员都是必要作的。应当向家长说明吸引儿童们照顾自己生活的教育意义。绝对不许可苏维埃学生轻视“粗笨工作”，自己逃避或由父母不让从事家中日常生活的劳动义务，而变成游手好闲的人。在未来的独立的生活中——在生活中，在中学毕业后的进一步学习中，在生产中、在军队中——照料自己的衣物和准备简单的食物等等技能，对于学生们是有好处的。把生活琐事的劳动看作是社会上女性的责任和命运，当作“婆婆妈妈的事情”乃是由资本主义制度和资产阶级社会里妇女地位所产生的有害的偏见之一。
    克鲁普斯卡亚在她自己的论文《应不应该教男孩子们学做“婆婆妈妈的事情？”》中说：“应当使男孩子、女孩子同样学习经济上所必要的一切，而不要认为作这件事情对于自己是不值得的。”
    当然，在这里不能够抹煞性别不同的学生在家庭劳动中的天然差别与特点。男孩子们，愿意做生活劳动中比较笨重一点的事情，如像：劈柴、生炉、提水等等。女孩子们，适合于做那种需要精确、细心装饰和有美学风趣的生活劳动。但是，这种分工，都是非常相对的。苏维埃学校的两性青年，都应当具有“技巧的双手”，实际地了解生活“琐事”，善于适应家中、道路上、新地方的任何物质条件，不应感到束手无策及一个独立的人不应有的对于不方便的害怕。
            学生们参加社会有益劳动
    在学生们的劳动教育的工作中，他们适力地参加各种各样的社会有益的生产劳动和社会工作，具有特别重大的意义。
    在伟大的卫国战争的诸年，我们学校的学生们，年青的苏维埃爱国者，完成了很多重要的社会有益事业：参加农业劳动，帮助集体农庄，收集金属物和有用处的野生植物，帮助前线工作者的家庭，帮助医院，适力地参加防空工作及其他等等。学校在我们人民伟大考验和英勇功绩的这些年代中的工作经验，证明社会有益劳动对于学生们具有何等伟大的思想教育的意义。在和平时期，社会有益劳动也应当用另外的方式，完全服从于学校教学任务的方式来进行的。
    学生们通过校内少先队和共青团的组织，参加各种社会有益事业。如像野生的可食食物和药用植物之采集、捕灭集体农场田地上的害虫，捕捉鸟类、造林等，这些社会有益劳动，在学校里，都得到了群众性的展开。我们学校的学生们，在暑假期内，尽力帮助集体农场收割，学校的学生们帮助农村阅览室、区立文化宫、区立地方博物馆、附近图书馆和其他文化教育机关工作。在苏维埃政权机关选举时期，在各选举区进行文娱活动。学校在附近居民中举办与当前政治运动相联系的滑雪宣传队及其他宣传队。学生们在教师指导之下，在自己学校附近的气象台中，进行气象观测，在自己学校的地方风土小组中，研究土壤和本区的天然富源，在青年博物小组的实验区内，从事选种及其他工作；而同时利用自己观察的结果，来给周围居民服务、提高本乡田地、菜园和果园的收获，提高地方工业。
    学生中少先队员们，组织“铁木儿队”，志愿每天为那些在争取我们祖国的自由和独立的战斗中牺牲的苏维埃战士及游击队家庭，以及在卫国战争中残废了的人们的家庭，作它们所必需的生活上的服务。学生中少先队员们，协助托儿所、操场和儿童之宫的工作，在这些地方，苏维埃政府以特别的关切，教育那些死于凶残的法西斯强盗们之手的双亲的子女们，学生中少先队员们还给孩子们搜集书籍，制造玩具，设置愉快的枞树及其他等等。
    苏维埃学校的学生们，以极大的热情，参加各种各样的社会有益劳动。我们使儿童习于贡献出自己的力量，知识和技能，以利于社会，从而培养他们对劳动的热爱，培养他们对社会工作的实际习惯。但是，这只有在社会有益劳动正确地组织起来和合乎教育目的的时候，才有意义的。
    组织学生们的社会有益劳动，要从基本的、原则上的观点出发，这便是说，它应当服从于学校内教学与教育的任务。
    在选择那些各年级学生都能参加的社会有益劳动的时候，应当顾及到他们的体力发展和智力发展的年龄特点，顾及到他们的社会意识的水平。应当保证，儿童们所执行的工作，对于他们是完全适力的，有趣的和可认识的。
    参加社会有益的劳动，应当促使学生们全面的发展——体力的、智力的和道德的。
    保护和巩固学生们的健康，对他们体力发展的关心，不应当表现在“温暖”条件的建立和对儿童的娇养溺爱。相反的，儿童的体力是在劳动中锻炼出来的，这种锻炼的方法是合理的一贯的训练，逐渐的适应于任何天气和环境，练习执行各种各样的劳动。
    学生们的社会有益劳动要具有教育的意义，应当促进学生们把在学校里获得的智识应用到实践，促进眼界的增阔、有益智识的增多，智力的发展。
    在组织学生们的社会有益劳动的时候，要善于把工作中的集体原则与每个参加者的个人努力的热情结合起来。
    学生们的社会工作，应当按照深思熟虑过的计划来进行。这个计划要给参加者解释明白，或者同他们一道拟定，要使他们每一个人都能理解。社会团体对作过的工作要作总结，并加以评价，把这种总结和评价通知集体，借以发展学生们的社会活动，提高他们在以后的社会有益劳动中的质量。
    社会有益劳动，在学校里，不应当仅仅只靠“积极分子”；应当尽可能以各种年龄可接受的程度和方式，把全校学生都吸收进去。
            劳动与纪律
    培养学生们的社会主义劳动态度，就是说培养他们的自觉的劳动纪律，培养他们具有实现自己学习义务和社会义务的责任感。年龄愈大的学生，这种负责意识也就应当愈高，劳动的纪律也就应当愈严格。
    在缺乏日常的和严格管制的环境中，在学生逃避所规定的要求、对于自己义务懈怠而不受责罚的环境中，不负责，懒惰，消闲和无所事事的现象，是很容易出现的。要是一个学生一直不好好地工作，不紧张努力，希冀“侥幸”，而只是无止境地和他“谈话”，派一个同学帮助他，和他进行慢性的“补充作业”，不采取有效的办法去迫使他工作，这就会对于那些违犯学习义务的学生，以及周围的学生们，发生一种消极恶劣的影响。
    学校里的劳动教育意味着使学生们习于自愿而切实地完成所作的（学业的和社会的）工作，并使学生习于顽强地克服所遭遇的困难。要达到这一点，只有学校的教师们，校长，少先队组长，学生的社会组织，非常细心地注视每一个学生对于他所担当的工作之执行情形，要求他们在指定的期限内以一定的质量完成它，公正地评价每件已经完成的工作，同时严格地责斥那种不诚实和不负责任的情形。在最严重的情形下，比如有些学生在工作中的无纪律性败坏了集体的信用，或者可能破坏了重大的公共措施，对于这种犯过错的人，应当利用集体的舆论予以特别严厉的斥责。
    一方面，我们的儿童们、少年们、青年学生们所特有的积极性，经常爱好活动的愿望，另一方面，劳动在苏联所占的光荣的地位，——这对学生们的劳动教育就创造了许多非常良好的条件。因此，马卡连科的原则是完全正确的，他不主张在劳动范围内采取某种奖励和惩罚的办法。他说：“劳动任务及其解决，本身就应当使小孩子心满意足，以致于感到快乐。承认他的工作是优良的工作，乃是对他的劳动之最好的报酬。”这是一个应当致力的理想的论题：使劳动本身吸引学生们，激发他们的积极性。当围绕着劳动（学业的和社会的）而在集体中建立起一种公共舆论的时候，劳动便成为公共承认的手段了。在学校的实践中，众所周知，有很多场合：吸收一个学生去从事集体中的某种公共的义务，委托他某一种公众的任务，——这是表现认可的一种最好的手段，而同时给他一种良好的影响。
    在学校里，劳动应当提到这样的高度，就是对于一个对自己的学业和社会义务玩忽的学生，剥夺授予他的社会劳动的任务和参加执行某种社会有益事业的光荣的权利，可作为对他的有效的惩罚办法之一。卓越的苏维埃教育学家马卡连科和我们学校许多先进教师们的教育工作经验中的很多例子，都证明了这种教育影响办法之巨大效力，其条件是在学生集体中组织适当的舆论。
    这样，学生们在整个教学过程中共产主义劳动观点的形成；学习中兴趣与努力之结合；学生独立工作之正确的组织，那些培养学生们实际劳动技能和习惯的学业和课外实习作业之进行，在学校、家庭和社会团体的日常的智力和体力劳动中对学生劳动努力积极性之刺激；对执行一切工作采取有系统的监督和加以客观的评判；学生们对正常而有组织的劳动的习惯之养成；学生集体中对于劳动纪律和社会义务问题的公众舆论之建立；创造性的独立精神之奖励；学生在任何一种工作中的主动精神，——这就是苏维埃学校中学生劳动教育之基本方法与手段，也是训练他们在未来作为苏维埃国家的当之无愧的公民从事创造性的生产劳动之基本方法与手段。
