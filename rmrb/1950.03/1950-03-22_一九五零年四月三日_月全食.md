The Total Lunar Eclipse on April 3, 1950
    Chinese Astronomical Society, Popular Astronomy Society manuscript

    A total lunar eclipse will be visible in our country on the morning of April 3rd. At 3:09 AM (Central Standard Time; those in the Longshu time zone should subtract one hour; the following times are the same), the moon will begin to enter the Earth's umbra. This is called "first contact." At 4:30 AM, the moon will be completely obscured by the Earth's shadow, called "totality." When the moon is in the center of the Earth's shadow, it is called "mid-eclipse," which will be at 4:44 AM. At 4:59 AM, the moon will begin to reappear and exit the Earth's shadow, called "emergence." At 6:19 AM, "final contact" will occur, and the moon will completely leave the Earth's umbra. The eastern parts of our country will not be able to see the final contact because the moon will have already set around 6:00 AM, but the main stages will be visible. In the western provinces such as Shaanxi and Sichuan, the entire process can be observed.

    In ancient China, the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses was considered an "ominous sign" and was given special importance. There are many records in ancient books, and there are various folk tales about "the Heavenly Dog eating the moon." Therefore, whenever there was a lunar eclipse, people would bang gongs, hit basins, and set off firecrackers, supposedly to scare away the "Heavenly Dog" and make it spit out the moon. In fact, lunar and solar eclipses are caused by the relative positions of the moon, Earth, and sun. The moon revolves around the Earth, reflecting sunlight to emit light. The Earth and the moon both cast a long shadow on the side facing away from the sun. When the moon enters the Earth's shadow, sunlight is blocked from reaching the moon, so the moon gradually darkens, eventually disappearing, thus producing a lunar eclipse. Conversely, when the moon moves between the sun and the Earth, and the moon's shadow falls on the Earth, a solar eclipse occurs. At the same time, we know that a lunar eclipse must occur on the full moon day (the 15th day of the lunar month), while a solar eclipse occurs on the new moon day (the 1st day of the lunar month). However, because the Earth's orbital plane and the moon's orbital plane are not on the same plane, solar and lunar eclipses do not occur every new and full moon.

    During a total lunar eclipse, the lunar surface is not completely dark but has a slightly reddish-copper color. This is because some sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere and is projected onto the lunar surface. This has nothing to do with the moon's surface itself. Moreover, the atmosphere makes the Earth's shadow less clear, making it difficult to accurately determine the beginning and end times of a lunar eclipse. Therefore, lunar eclipses have little scientific value compared to the importance of solar eclipses.

　　一九五零年四月三日“月全食”
    中国天文学会、大众天文社稿
    四月三日清晨，我国可见到一次月全食。三时九分（中原标准时，在陇蜀时区的请减去一小时，以下都这样）月球开始进入地球的黑影，这时叫“初亏”；四时三十分月球完全被地影遮住叫“食既”；当月球走在地影中央时叫“食甚”，那时是四时四十四分；四时五十九分月球开始露面走出地影，这时叫“生光”；六时十九分“复圆”，月球完全脱离了地球黑影。我国东部各地都来不及看到复圆，因为月球已在六时左右下山了，但主要的过程都可看到。在西部陕西、四川等省则可以看完整个经过。
    我国古代对日月食的发生认为是“不祥之兆”而特别重视，古书上的记载很多，民间也有种种“天狗吃月亮”的传说，所以每逢月食时，有人敲锣、打盆、放爆竹等，据说这能吓走“天狗”让它吐出月亮还给我们。其实月食和日食是因为月球、地球、太阳三者间的相对位置产生的。月球绕地球运行，反射太阳光而发光，地球和月球在背着太阳的一面都拖着一个很长的黑影。当月球走进地影时，太阳光被阻不能照到月球上，这时月球就由圆而缺，以至于无了，这样产生了月食。相反地月球走到太阳和地球中间，月影落在地上，就发生日食。同时我们知道月食必定是发生在望日（阴历每月十五），而日食是在朔日（每月初一）发生。但因为地球轨道面和月球轨道面并不都在同一平面上，所以并不是每个朔望都有日月食的现象。
    月全食时，月面并不完全黑暗，略带紫铜色，这是由于一部分日光经过地球大气层，照射到月面上所引起的。这和月面本身没有关系，而且大气层使地影不很清楚，月食始末时间也就很难精确测定，所以月食在科学上的价值很少，不如日食的重要。
