　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th: TASS, Moscow, March 4th: Comrade Zhudakov, a member of the Stalin Prize Committee for Science and Invention, recently stated: The great Stalin's instruction to not only catch up with but also surpass foreign science and technology is now being successfully implemented in the Soviet Union. The achievements of the scientific workers who have won the Stalin Prize this time prove this point. The rolling mill for producing rails and steel beams manufactured by the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant surpasses similar machines at home and abroad in terms of productivity, original design, high degree of mechanization, and automatic operation. Under the leadership of Chief Designer Kovalev of the Leningrad Metal Plant, the world's largest new type of hydraulic turbine has been designed for the Dnieper River Power Station. The use of this turbine has proven to be far superior to that of the United States. The new "hose" welding method has been widely introduced into the machinery manufacturing industry. This welding method saves 30% to 40% of electricity and greatly increases labor productivity. Soviet inventors have realized the ideal of prospecting for oil by exploring the gas in oil layers. The highly sensitive tools invented by scientists and engineers can detect oil and determine the size of oil layers based on the movement of gas in the oil layers. For the first time in the world, gas exploration has been theoretically proven. Engineer Klezer and others designed television machinery superior to existing foreign ones. Personnel at the Yaroslavl Film Studio, under the leadership of Dagir, the inventor of Soviet sound films, invented a new method of film recording. The powerful rotary cement kiln built under the leadership of engineer Pokov is of great significance for accelerating and improving the quality of reconstruction and construction work. Other inventions that save manpower and increase labor productivity include new excavators and loaders for loading stones excavated from vertical shafts.

　　成功地实现了斯大林的指示  苏联科学发明超过外国
    新式辗机、德聂伯河电力站新式水力透平、电视机械、气体勘察等均大大胜过了外国
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：苏联科学与发明斯大林奖金委员会委员朱达科夫顷称：伟大的斯大林关于不仅要赶上外国科学和技术而且还要超过它们的指示，现在正在苏联成功地实现中。这次荣获斯大林奖金的科学工作者的成就，便证明了这一点。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂制造了一种生产铁轨和钢梁的辗机，就其生产率、独创的设计、高度的机械化和自动操作来说，都超过苏联国内外同类的机器。在列宁格勒五金工厂总设计师哥瓦列夫的领导下，已为德聂伯河电力站设计出世界上最大的新式水力透平，这种透平的使用证明已大大地胜过了美国。新的“软管”电焊法已广泛地介绍到机器制造业中。这种电焊法节省用电百分之三十至四十，并大大地增加了劳动生产率。苏联发明家已实现了由油层瓦斯勘察石油的理想，科学家和工程师所发明的感应很强的工具，已能根据油层中瓦斯的运行来探察石油和决定油层的大小，世界上气体勘察第一次得到理论上的证明。工程师克列泽尔等人设计了优于外国现有的电视机械。雅洛林电影摄制研究院的人员，在苏联有声电影发明家达吉尔的领导下，发明了新的电影录音法。工程师波可夫领导下所建造的强力转动水门汀窑，对加速和改进重建和建筑工作的质量，具有重大意义。其他节省人力和提高劳动生产率的发明有新式掘凿机，装载垂直矿井掘出石块的装载机等等。
