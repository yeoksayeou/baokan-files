　　Reader's Letters
　　Editor's Note: Our newspaper has continuously published some reader's letters, which has greatly helped the improvement of various tasks. We welcome everyone to write to us about problems in their work and life as much as possible, and we hope that relevant departments will pay attention to replying to these letters.
　　Raise Vigilance and Strengthen Air Defense Work Editor Comrades:
　　I have a few suggestions for air defense work, please forward them to the Beijing Air Defense Headquarters, and I hope all businesses, institutions, and residents will pay attention.
　　1. The previous alarm sound was too small, and many places could not hear it clearly, or even hear it at all. I hope that alarm devices can be established in each public security sub-bureau, so that they can sound simultaneously when there is an alarm.
　　2. The Telecommunications Bureau should set up an air defense inquiry desk to facilitate inquiries from citizens.
　　3. Many institutions, shops, residents, etc., have paper strips pasted on their glass, only for aesthetic purposes, and do not understand that the purpose of pasting paper strips is to prevent broken glass from hurting people during air raids. I hope you will pay attention to correcting this. Zhang Zhaohe
　　Please introduce the experience of saving coal Editor Comrades:
　　We are very interested in the report on the second page of your newspaper on February 27 about the cook Wang Wenshan of a certain division directly under the North China Military Region inventing a new method of burning coal, which saves half the amount of coal used. We are willing to absorb this experience so that the amount of coal burned in our canteen can be reduced. We would like to visit that division on the ground. I hope you can convey our opinions to the comrades in charge of cooking in that division.
　　All the catering staff of the Student Canteen of Tsinghua University
　　Editor's Note: Please ask the comrade in charge of cooking in a certain division to tell us the specific method, and please ask the comrade in charge of the division to reply to the visit question raised in this letter.
　　Logging Should Pay Attention to Forest Protection Editor Comrades:
　　There was a Xinhua News Agency dispatch on the "People's Garden" on March 1, reporting on the situation of a certain unit of our Fourth Field Army logging in Luofu Mountain in Zengcheng County, Guangdong; however, the article did not mention how to protect seedlings and renew the forest. Therefore, I have some thoughts on this:
　　Forests like Luofu Mountain mentioned in the article, which are "shaded by trees, with towering ancient trees, and rarely visited by people for logging," are not many in our country, so we should develop them well. However, the article did not mention how to cultivate after logging, and how to protect seedlings during the logging process. I think this is one-sided logging, which loses the true meaning of production.
　　Therefore, I suggest that the troops should combine logging with forest protection and regeneration in the future, so that the wood produced in the mountain can be continuously supplied and become a treasure trove of national wealth forever.
　　Yang Ruixiang, Sixth Forestry Sub-bureau, Shanxi Province
　　Editor's Note: We have forwarded this letter to the Fourth Field Army.

　　读者来信
    编者按：本报连续发表了一些读者来信，这对于各方面工作的改进，有着很大的帮助。欢迎大家把工作、生活中的问题尽量写给我们，并希各有关部门，对这些信件注意答复。
    提高警惕，加强防空工作编辑同志：
    我对防空工作有几点建议，请转达北京防空指挥部，并希各商号、机关、住户注意。
    一、以前的警报声音太小，很多地方听不清，甚至听不见。希望在各公安分局建立警报器，在有警报时，可以同时响。
    二、电信局应设防空询问台，以便市民询问。
    三、有许多机关、商店、住户等玻璃上贴的纸条，只图美观，而不了解贴纸条是为了空袭时防止震碎玻璃伤人。希注意纠正。    张朝和
  请介绍节省烧煤的经验编辑同志：
    我们看到二月二十七日贵报第二版所载关于华北军区直属某师炊事员王文善发明新烧煤方法，用煤量节省二分之一的工作报导，很感兴趣，愿意吸取这个经验，使我们膳团的烧煤的数量能够减少。我们想实地到那个师内去参观一次。希望你们能把我们的意见转达给该师负责炊事工作的同志。
    清华大学学生膳团全体膳食工作者
    编者按：请某师炊事工作的负责同志，将具体方法告诉我们，并请该师负责同志答复这封信所提出的参观问题。
    采伐应注意护林编辑同志：
    三月一日“人民园地”上有一篇新华社通讯，报导我解放军第四野战军某部在广东增城县的罗浮山采伐山林情形；但文中却没有提及怎样保护幼株与更新。故我对此有点感想：
    像文中所说罗浮山这样“林荫蔽日，古木参天，从来很少有人上山采伐过”的森林，在我国是不多的，我们便应予以很好的开发。但文中对采伐之后怎样培养，及在采伐过程中怎样保护幼株等，都没有说到。我以为这是片面的采伐，是有失生产的真意的。
    因此，我建议该部队今后采伐应该与护林及更新相结合，以使该山所生的木材源源不断，永为国家财富的宝库。
      山西省林业第六分局杨瑞祥
    编者按：我们已将这封信转给第四野战军。
