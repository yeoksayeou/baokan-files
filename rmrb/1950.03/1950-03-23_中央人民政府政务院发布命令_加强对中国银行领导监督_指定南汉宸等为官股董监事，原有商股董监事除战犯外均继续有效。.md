Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in order to strengthen the leadership and supervision of the People's Government over the Bank of China and to promote the development of the bank's business, issued the following order today:

　　The shares of the Bank of China, in addition to one-third being commercial shares, have two-thirds invested by the state, making it a public-private joint venture bank. Now that the whole country has been liberated and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has long been established, the state investment in the bank should naturally be owned by the Central People's Government. In order to strengthen the leadership and supervision of the People's Government over the bank, Nan Hanchen, Cao Juru, Ma Yinchu, Hu Jingyun, Sha Qianli, Zhang Hanfu, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Shaoyu, Gong Yinbing, Ji Chaoding, Zhan Wu, Sun Xiaocun, Zheng Tieru and other thirteen people are specifically designated as government shareholder directors of the bank. He Xiangning, Chen Jiageng, Situ Meitang, Xu Dixing, and Li Shizhang are designated as five government shareholder supervisors.

　　The original commercial shareholder directors and supervisors of the Bank of China, except for war criminals, shall remain valid. The bank should convene a board meeting in the short term to promote the development of its business.

　　This order.
      Premier Zhou Enlai
