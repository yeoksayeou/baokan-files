[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently issued a proclamation deciding that, effective immediately, the business of supervising and certifying real estate deed prices, previously handled by the public security police stations, will be uniformly transferred to the Real Estate Exchange. When the Municipal Government promulgated the "Draft of the Temporary Measures for Deed Tax in Peiping Municipality" last September, it stipulated that: "Anyone establishing a contract after the promulgation of the deed tax measures must obtain an application form and deed paper from the police station in the location of the property. The detailed boundaries, quantity, and price of the real estate must be filled out. In addition to inviting the seller's neighbors and the intermediary to stamp the deed as witnesses, it must also be supervised and certified by the police station. If the properties do not belong to the same area, they must be supervised and certified by the police stations of both parties, and then the deed tax must be paid according to the various tax rates stipulated in Article 4 of the Temporary Measures for Deed Tax." The new measures stipulated this time are: "Whenever citizens buy, pawn, or exchange real estate rights transferring, after the contract is established, they must obtain an application form from the city's Real Estate Exchange, fill it out in detail, and have it supervised and certified by the Real Estate Exchange with a supervision and certification stamp. Then, they should go to the Municipal Finance Bureau to pay the deed tax according to regulations. Otherwise, the Finance Bureau will not process the tax deed procedures for uncertified deeds."

　　京房地契价归房地产交易所监证
    【北京讯】京市人民政府顷发出布告，决定自即日起将过去公安派出所监证房地契价之业务统一划归房地产交易所办理。去年九月市府颁布“北平市契税暂行办法草案”时，曾规定：“凡在契税办法公布后成立契约者，须向产业所在地之派出所领购声请书及契纸。详细填写房地四至、数目及价格，除邀请卖主四邻及中证人于契纸盖章作证外，并须经派出所作监证。产业不属同一地区者，须经两方派出所作监证，然后依照契税暂行办法第四条规定之各种税率交纳契税”。此次规定的新办法是：“凡市民买、典及交换房地产权迁转时，于成立契约后，须向本市房地产交易所领取声请书详细填写，并经房地产交易所监证加盖监证戳记后，再赴市财政局照章缴纳契税，否则，未经监证的契件，财政局不予办理税契手续。”
