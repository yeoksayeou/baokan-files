　　Normal University
　　Beijing National Normal University held a production work and organization discussion meeting on the 15th. At the meeting, Ding Haochuan conveyed the Ministry of Education's production plan, pointing out that everyone should establish their labor and mass viewpoints through production. Therefore, this is not only a production course, but also a political course.
　　The Physics Department, Art Department, Nursery Department, and Educational Technology Center formed a production planning committee to plan industrial production. It has a chemical engineering department, an art department, a printing department, a laundry and weaving department, a tofu workshop, and a flour milling department. The heads of each department were elected on the same day, and production work began.

　　Jiaotong University
　　The Beijing Management Institute of China Jiaotong University established a production committee on the 16th, with departments for management, planning, technology, and labor organization. More than 80% of the students in the school signed up to participate in production; all the female students participated. The production committee sent responsible comrades to Nanyuan to survey the land on the 22nd, and work will begin soon. (Jiaotong University Beijing Institute Communications Group)
　　Beijing Normal
　　Beijing Normal's after-school production has begun. The land for cultivation on campus has been turned over and is about to be sown. The students sifted out the stones and coal cinders from the ground and replaced them with good soil.
　　For suburban production, one or two classes of students go every afternoon. Most of the farm tools were borrowed from home by students from the city. The students' production enthusiasm is very high, and they guarantee not to "start strong and finish weak."
　　(Beijing Normal Communications Group Yang Yinfang)
　　Since the Beijing Normal Broadcasting Group launched a campaign last week for teachers and students to listen to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station's youth program in their spare time, many people have gathered in front of the loudspeaker after lunch every day, waiting to listen to the broadcast. When Ding Haochuan spoke about "Talking to Young Friends About Family Issues" and Qian Junrui spoke about "The Historical Characteristics of the Chinese Revolution," the students listened very carefully, and some even took notes. Because listening to the radio can assist learning and improve political awareness, a craze for listening to the radio has now been created at Beijing Normal.

　　First Middle School
　　The Municipal First Middle School improved the students' meals and set up a tofu workshop. It officially "opened for business" on the 19th. The students scrambled to push the mill and carry water. That day, 28 catties of beans produced a total of 51 catties of tofu (all sold out on the same day), and 128 servings of soy milk, all of which were provided to boarding students the next morning. Now, they are preparing to make soy milk coupons, which can be used to drink soy milk. Each soy milk coupon sells for 100 to 150 yuan.
　　(First Middle School Communications Group)
　　Second Middle School
　　After several days of mobilization and deliberation, the Second Middle School Production Committee has successfully completed the work of exchanging labor and combining production with education. In terms of labor exchange, three workers, including Chen Hansheng, voluntarily proposed to go to the fields, and their positions were shared by students and other workers. In terms of combining learning with production, teachers of physics, chemistry, and biology, agricultural technicians, and students with agricultural knowledge jointly organized a research group to study soil, fertilization, planting, and cultivation. Teachers of music, sports, and art also began to study new topics that combine practical labor with learning. On the afternoon of the 22nd, more than 60 students in Class 1 of the first year completed their first day's production plan in three hours by opening up one mu of wasteland.
　　(Second Middle School Communications Group)
　　Third Middle School
　　Every classroom in the Municipal Third Middle School is equipped with a loudspeaker, which will be used to carry out recreational activities.
　　The land for production in this school has been allocated outside Dongzhimen. Although it is far from the school, the students' enthusiasm is still very high. Each class takes turns going to production during afternoon self-study. (Municipal Third Middle School Communications Group)
　　Fourth Middle School
　　The Municipal Fourth Middle School is relentlessly implementing air defense. Air raid shelters have been dug by the students, and they are now pasting paper strips on the glass windows. First-aid equipment has also been prepared, and teachers and students have raised their vigilance very high.
　　(Fourth Middle School Communications Group)
　　Fifth Middle School
　　In order to effectively improve students' learning, the Municipal Fifth Middle School recently purchased a large number of books, a set of physics experimental instruments, and two of the latest world maps and People's Republic of China maps for each class.
　　Also, literary and artistic activities have been quite active recently, and many people have signed up for piano practice classes.
　　(Hao Chengying)
　　Ji High
　　The Hebei High School General Branch of the Communist Youth League was re-elected on the 18th. In the last semester, the school's Communist Youth League carried out New Democracy studies and other movements. Due to the exemplary role of the League members, the number of League members increased from 118 to 354; however, there was a lack of ideological education for the League members, and the organizational life was not strict enough. The above shortcomings will be overcome in the future.
　　(Ji High Communications Group Wang Ruilin)
　　All the students of Hebei High School are repairing and paving the large playground. The playground area is 2,800 square meters. This project will save the school more than 2,500 catties of millet. (Ji High Communications Group Zhai Yun)
　　Yu Ying
　　The work of the Communist Youth League in Yu Ying Middle School has made great progress. At the beginning of the last semester, there were only more than 100 League members in the school, but now there are 407, accounting for one-quarter of the total number of students in the school; it has become a powerful guarantee for uniting teachers and students and studying regular courses well. This semester, the Yu Ying League General Branch, in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities, is preparing to establish a League Committee. On the 18th, the League Committee was elected at a general meeting of all League members, and the Yu Ying League Committee was officially announced.
　　(Yu Ying Communications Group)
　　Yi Wen
　　In order to take care of and understand the health of the students, the Yi Wen Middle School has contacted the Beijing-Tianjin Anti-Tuberculosis Association to give preferential treatment to students for collective examinations and X-ray fluoroscopy, with a cost of 3,000 yuan per person. At present, more than 150 students have signed up for the examination.
　　(Yi Wen Communications Group)
　　Hui Wen
　　The Hui Wen General Branch of the Communist Youth League conducted a general branch re-election on the 20th. At the re-election meeting, Xu Yongjiang of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and Zhang Shiji of the Hui Wen Party Branch reported on "The Central Task of Communist Youth League Members in Schools" and "The Purpose of the Re-election."

　　学校生活
    师大
    北京国立师范大学十五日召开了生产工作及组织谈话会。会上由丁浩川传达了教育部的生产计划，指出大家要通过生产来建立自己的劳动观点与群众观点。所以这不但是一门生产课程，同时也是一门政治课程。
    物理系、美工系、保育系、电教馆并组成一生产计划委员会，计划工业生产。设有化工部、美工部、印刷部、洗衣与缝织部、豆腐坊与磨粉等部。当日即推定出各部的负责人，开始进行生产工作。

    交大
    中国交通大学北京管理学院十六日成立了生产委员会，下设管理、计划、技术、劳动组织等部门。全校报名参加生产的同学占全校同学的百分之八十以上；女同学全部参加了。生产委员会于二十二日曾派负责同志到南苑分地处察勘，最近即可展开工作。（交大京院通讯组）
    北师
    北师的课余生产已开始。校内耕地土已翻好，即将撒种。同学们把地里的石头煤渣都筛去，换上了好土。
    郊外生产，每日下午都有一两班同学去。农具多是本市同学由家借来的。同学们的生产情绪都很高，保证不“虎头蛇尾”。
        （北师通讯组杨荫芳）
    北师广播小组自上周发动师生在课余收听北京市人民广播电台青年节目以来，每天午饭以后，很多人都聚到扩音机前等候着听广播。当丁浩川讲“和青年朋友们谈谈家庭问题”和钱俊瑞讲“中国革命的历史特点”的时候，同学们都非常用心地听着，有的还记了笔记。因为听广播可以辅助学习，和提高政治认识，现在北师已经造成了听广播的热潮。

    一中
    市立一中改善同学伙食，设了一个豆腐房。十九日已正式“开市”。同学都争先恐后地推磨、挑水。那天二十八斤豆子共出了豆腐五十一斤（当天已全部卖出），和豆浆一二八份，第二天早晨全部供给住宿同学喝了。现在准备制豆浆券，凭券来喝。豆浆券每张卖一百元至一百五十元。
    （一中通讯组）
    二中
    二中生产委员会经过数日的动员、酝酿，已胜利完成了变工及结合生产配合教育的工作。在变工方面，陈汉生等三个工友自动提出到田里去，他们的职务则由同学和其他工友分担。在学习生产结合方面，物理、化学、生物等先生、有农业技术工友和有农业知识的同学联合组织了研究小组，研究土壤、施肥、种植、培养等；音乐、体育、美术等先生也结合生产开始研究配合实际劳动学习的新课题。二十二日下午，初三一班六十余人，三小时中便完成了第一天的生产计划开了一亩荒地。

    冀高
    青年团河北高中总支部，已于十八日改选。本校青年团在上学期开展新民主主义学习，及其它运动中，由于团员的模范作用，团员由一一八人发展到三五四人；但是缺乏团的思想教育，组织生活过的也不够严密。上述缺点将会在今后获得克服。
        （冀高通讯组王瑞麟）
    河北高中全校同学正修垫大操场。操场面积为两千八百平方公尺。这一工程将节省学校开支小米二千五百余斤。（冀高通讯组翟芸）
