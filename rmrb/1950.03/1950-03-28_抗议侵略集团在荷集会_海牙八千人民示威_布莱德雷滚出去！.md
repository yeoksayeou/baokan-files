　　Protesting Aggressor Group's Meeting in the Netherlands
    Eight Thousand People Demonstrate in The Hague
    "Bradley Get Out!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 27th] According to TASS, The Hague, 26th: The representatives of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states are currently holding a series of military meetings in The Hague, which have been met with resolute protests from the broad masses of the Dutch people. Eight thousand working people in The Hague held a demonstration. Their placards read: "Down with military meetings!" "Bradley get out!" "No foreign generals, no anti-Soviet war!" "Long live peace!" The police brutally dispersed the demonstrators.
    Many delegations of women representing Amsterdam, Utrecht, Hilversum and other cities came to The Hague, expressing their resolute opposition to war preparations and demanding an end to the war-mongers' meetings.
    The Dutch Communist newspaper *De Waarheid* published an article by de Groot, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, exposing the military talks in The Hague. De Groot wrote: Army and navy generals are discussing in The Hague a plan to adopt a world war in preparation against the Soviet Union. They chose the Netherlands, hoping to find here "a place in Western Europe where those plans could be drafted." However, they miscalculated. The majority of the Dutch people say "no" to the warmongers. This can be clearly proved by the incidents of refusing to unload American military supplies. In various gatherings, the Dutch working people oppose war plans and resolutely support peace. This will inevitably make the generals in The Hague understand that they are not dealing with pawns, but with living people who desire peace.

　　抗议侵略集团在荷集会
    海牙八千人民示威
    “布莱德雷滚出去！”
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社海牙二十六日讯：侵略性的北大西洋公约会员国的代表们目前正在海牙举行的一连串军事会议，已遭受荷兰广大人民的坚决抗议。海牙八千劳动人民举行了示威游行。他们的标语牌上写着：“打倒军事会议！”“布莱德雷滚出去！”“不要外国将军们，不要反苏战争！”“和平万岁！”警察残酷地驱打示威者。
    许多代表阿姆斯特丹、乌得勒支、希尔佛萨姆及其他城市的妇女的代表团来到海牙，表示她们对备战的坚决抗议，并要求终止战贩们的会议。
    荷共真理报刊载荷兰共产党总书记德·格鲁特揭露海牙军事会谈的文章。德·格鲁特写道：陆海军将军们在海牙商量采用准备反对苏联的世界战争的计划。他们选择了荷兰，希望在这里找着“西欧能够草就那些计划的地点”。可是，他们估计错了。大多数荷兰人民向战争贩子们说：“不”。这由拒卸美国军火的事件中就可以清楚地得到证明。在各种集会中，荷兰劳动人民反对战争计划，并坚决地拥护和平。这必然会使在海牙的将军们懂得：他们所要对付的不是小卒，而是渴望和平的活生生的人民。
