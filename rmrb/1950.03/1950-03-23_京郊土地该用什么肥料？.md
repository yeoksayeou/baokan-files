　　What Kind of Fertilizer Should Be Used for the Land Around Beijing?
    Question: We want to increase grain production, but buying fertilizer is too expensive. We used fertilizer powder in the past, but it burned the crops. Is there any other way?
         (Zhang Lingui)
    Answer: Now, to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer, in addition to promoting farmers' traditional fertilizer accumulation habits and accumulating large amounts of fertilizer every year, we must promote the use of city manure in the countryside, that is, transporting urban excrement to the countryside. The black mud dug out of the sewers is also a good fertilizer. Cooperatives can also buy oil cakes from the Northeast for everyone, or buy ammonium sulfate from the Yongli Chemical Industries in East China. Encouraging everyone to raise more livestock is also a good way. You say buying fertilizer is too expensive. We investigated the situation. Currently, the cheapest fertilizer in Beijing that can be bought with money, in terms of both price and fertilizer content, is still human manure. Now, 30 catties of corn can buy 1,000 catties of manure. If used on one mu of wheat land, it can yield an additional 50 to 60 catties. So, it is not expensive.
    The reason why the fertilizer powder you used in the past burned the crops was probably because you didn't use it properly.
    Chemical fertilizers, according to the fertilizer content, can be divided into three types: nitrogenous fertilizers, phosphatic fertilizers, and potash fertilizers. The most common and frequently used nitrogenous fertilizer is ammonium sulfate, which is commonly known as fertilizer powder. The most common phosphatic fertilizer is superphosphate (bone meal contains a lot of this), and the most commonly used potash fertilizer is potassium sulfate. Which of these should we use? This depends on what the soil lacks.
    The soil near Beijing is most deficient in nitrogen fertilizer, followed by phosphate fertilizer, while potash fertilizer is not very deficient. If using chemical fertilizers, you can use ammonium sulfate, applying 20 to 40 catties per mu, in two or three applications. In addition, add 10 to 20 catties of superphosphate or bone meal per mu. These fertilizers should be used before planting. In addition to applying chemical fertilizers, you should also apply some manure, which is both economical and will not deteriorate the soil.

　　京郊土地该用什么肥料？
    问：我们想多打粮食，可是买肥料太贵；过去用过肥田粉，反而把庄稼烧坏了。有什么别的办法没有？ 
         （张林桂）
    答：现在我们要想解决肥料不足这个问题，除了发扬农家旧有的积肥习惯，每年大量地积存肥料以外，要提倡城粪下乡，就是把城市里头的粪便运到乡下去。下水道中挖出的黑泥，也是很好的肥料。还可以由合作社替大家到东北去买油饼，或者往华东永利硫酸铵厂去买硫酸铵。鼓励大家多养牲口也是好办法。你说买肥料太贵，我们调查了一下情况，现在北京要花钱买而且可能买到的肥料，从价钱和肥分两方面来说，还是以人粪最便宜。现在用三十斤玉米就可以买到一千斤粪肥。如果用在一亩小麦地上，比不上肥的可以多收五六十斤。这样算起来，也就不贵了。
    你们过去用肥田粉把庄稼烧坏了，大概是用的不得法。
    化学肥料，按所含的肥分，可以分作氮质肥料、磷质肥料和钾质肥料三种。最普通而常用的氮质肥料是硫酸铵，也就是平常说的肥田粉。磷质肥料最普通用的是过磷酸钙（骨粉中含有很多这种东西），钾质肥料最常用的是硫酸钾。这几种我们究竟应该用那一种才合适呢？这就要看地里缺的是什么才能决定。
    北京附近的土地最缺乏的是氮肥，其次是磷肥，钾肥却不怎么缺。要是用化学肥料的话，可以用硫酸铵，每亩地可以上二十斤到四十斤。分两三次上。另外每亩地再加上十斤到二十斤的过磷酸钙，或者用骨粉也可以。这些肥料，都要在栽种以前使用。除了上化学肥料以外，还应该上一些粪肥，这样既经济、又不会使地质变坏。
