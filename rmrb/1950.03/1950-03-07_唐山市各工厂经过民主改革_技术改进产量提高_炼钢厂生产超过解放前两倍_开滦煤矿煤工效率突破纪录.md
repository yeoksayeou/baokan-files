　　Tangshan Factories Undergo Democratic Reform; Technical Improvements Increase Production
    Steel Plant Production More Than Doubles Pre-Liberation Levels
    Kailuan Coal Mine Coal Workers' Efficiency Breaks Records
    [Our Dispatch] After initial democratic reforms last year, the production volume of public and private factories and mines in Tangshan City increased month by month. By the end of the year, all factories and mines had exceeded pre-Liberation production levels.
    Tangshan is one of the most famous industrial areas in the country. The city has eleven enterprises and one hundred twenty-one small and medium-sized factories, including railway, postal and telecommunications, coal mine, steel, cement, brick and tile, power generation, textile, paper making, flour milling, printing, chemical, oil refining, brewing, dyeing and washing and other production departments, with more than 82,700 employees. Before the liberation of Tangshan in December 1948, the city's industry and mining were largely paralyzed under the Kuomintang bandit gang's counter-revolutionary civil war policy and the cruel oppression of bureaucratic capital. The Kailuan Coal Mine, which had been mined for more than 70 years, was also in a state of semi-paralysis, with operations suspended for one day after every three days of work due to poor sales and accumulated debts. The Huaxin Textile Factory, with more than 30,000 spindles and more than 500 looms, changed from two shifts, day and night, to a single shift due to insufficient raw material supply. Other small and medium-sized factories were also in a state of decline or semi-shutdown.
    After the liberation of Tangshan, under the unified leadership of the Military Control Commission, relevant departments concentrated their efforts to open up urban-rural relations to solve the crisis of unsalable products. At the same time, workers were called upon to grit their teeth and overcome difficulties to maintain production. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, due to the rapid restoration of transportation, the city's industrial production turned to a period of recovery. Subsequently, in April and May, factories launched "Red May" production competitions. In June and July, a campaign for conservation and a democratic movement to reform unreasonable systems were launched, thus gradually raising workers' awareness and increasingly correcting their attitude toward labor. In July and August, continuous rain and floods severely affected the city's industry. However, thanks to the workers' heroic rescue and active recovery efforts, factories had returned to normal production by October, and production efficiency had increased significantly. If the average monthly production index of the state-owned steel plant in 1948 is 100, then in December of last year, the output of cast steel was 320.5, steel bars production was 390.85, and refractory materials were 383.25. After workers researched and improved technology, the rate of defective steel was reduced to 2.6 percent. The main tasks of the railway factory were to repair locomotives and manufacture passenger and freight cars. Taking the monthly output in 1948 as the base, in December of last year, locomotive repairs were 104.3 percent, newly built passenger cars were 316.9 percent, and freight cars were 115.3 percent. The number of workdays was inversely proportional to the production base: locomotive repairs used labor equivalent to 70.4 percent of 1948, new passenger car production used labor equivalent to 46.1 percent, and freight car production used labor equivalent to 24 percent. The total power supply of Tangshan Power Plant of North China Electric Power Company in December last year exceeded the average monthly supply in 1948 by 15 percent. In joint public-private and private enterprises, production has also generally increased. The Kailuan Coal Mine's normal production situation before the War of Resistance Against Japan was an annual output of 5 million tons, an average monthly output of 417,000 tons, and a coal worker efficiency of 900 to 1,000 kilograms. The average monthly output for November and December of last year was 435,000 tons, which reached the production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan and exceeded the monthly output of 355,832 tons during the Kuomintang rule by 24 percent. The average coal worker efficiency has reached 1,005 kilograms, breaking the production record of the past nine years. The ceramics industry, Tangshan's main specialty product, has also recovered and developed considerably. Among them, electrical porcelain and sanitary ware are particularly prominent. The total monthly output value of the public-owned Qixin Porcelain Factory in 1948 was equivalent to 171,493 kilograms of millet. In November last year, the total output value was equivalent to 332,718 kilograms of millet, exceeding the pre-Liberation level by 95 percent. The average monthly output of Huaxin Textile Factory in 1948 was 989,204 pieces of cloth and 1,528,229 pieces of yarn. In December of last year, cloth production exceeded the pre-Liberation level by 32 percent, and yarn production exceeded it by 7.6 percent. The production situation of other private enterprises, except for cement production, which has not yet approached pre-war levels due to supply and demand relations, is unprecedented since the liberation of Tangshan. The number of various machine parts repaired and manufactured by the machinery and iron industry in October was three times the average monthly number since June.
    The rapid recovery of the city's industrial production and its exceeding of pre-Liberation levels is mainly due to the increased awareness of the working class, the active improvement of tools and the improvement of production technology, the correction of labor attitudes and the strengthening of production discipline education. Factories and mines have enthusiastically launched democratic reform movements in conjunction with the development of production movements, partially abolishing the corrupt and unreasonable systems left over by the Kuomintang, such as Kailuan's abolition of the foreman's counter and mine police system's oppression, which sucked the workers' blood and sweat, and initially adjusted the unreasonable phenomenon of excessively disparate wages for employees. Huaxin Textile Factory, Railway Factory, and others abolished the "body search" system that insulted workers. The ceramics industry abolished the illegal exploitation of kiln class (the wages for burning cylinders are distributed on a loan system, where the capitalists first pick the good cylinders after firing, and the rest are distributed to the workers proportionally). Tangshan Electric Power Company and Desheng Porcelain Factory adjusted personnel, etc. As a result, workers' awareness has been raised, and new labor attitudes have begun to be established. As a female worker at Huaxin Yarn Factory said: "In the past, women worked because they were forced by life and did not understand why they were producing, so they did not do their work well. Now everyone knows that they are the masters, they are no longer searched after leaving the factory, their children are taken care of, and they can say anything they want, so they are all active in production." In the past year, workers in the city have made 113 major inventions and imitations, and new tools and machine parts have been modified, which have solved many production difficulties. For example, the five-ton two-pull high-voltage suspension battery, which Qixin Porcelain Factory hired German technicians to research for many years without success, can now be manufactured in large quantities. The wind brake machine, which the railway factory has always relied on imports, can now be manufactured by itself. The electric brick rolling machine (for making refractory bricks) created by Li Chunmao and Zhou Fengtong of Desheng Porcelain Factory produces 17,000 bricks per day, which is 1,140 percent more than the 1,500 bricks per day produced by the manual machine in the past. After eight trial repairs, workers at the steel plant repaired the Bessemer furnace, which had not been successfully tested during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule, and can directly produce steel from iron, solving the difficulty of purchasing steel materials, and producing a furnace of steel every 40 minutes, increasing the output several times.

　　唐山市各工厂经过民主改革
    技术改进产量提高
    炼钢厂生产超过解放前两倍
    开滦煤矿煤工效率突破纪录
    【本报讯】唐山市公私营工厂矿山，去年初步实行民主改革后，生产量逐月上升，至年底各厂矿均已超过解放前生产水平。
    唐山是全国著名的工业区之一，全市有十一个企业单位，一百二十一个中小工厂，包括有铁路、邮电、煤矿、钢铁、洋灰、砖瓷、发电、纺织、造纸、制粉、印刷、化学、制油、酿酒、染洗等生产部门，拥有职工八万二千七百余人。一九四八年十二月唐山解放前夕，该市工矿业在国民党匪帮反革命内战政策和官僚资本的残酷压榨下，大部陷于停顿。开采七十多年的开滦煤矿，因运销不畅，积煤欠资，亦陷于开工三天停工一天的半停顿状态。具有三万余纱锭，五百余台布机的华新纺织厂，因原料供应不足，将日夜两班改为一班制。其他各中小工厂也都处于萎缩或半歇业状态。
    唐山解放后，在军管会统一领导下，各有关部门集中全力打通城乡关系，以解决产品滞销的危机；同时号召工人咬紧牙关克服困难，以维持生产。京、津解放后，由于交通迅速恢复，该市工业生产即转入恢复时期。继于四、五月间各工厂展开了红五月的生产竞赛运动；六、七月间又开展了节约运动和改革不合理制度的民主运动，因而工人觉悟逐渐提高，劳动态度日益端正。七、八月间霪雨连绵，洪水为灾，该市工业受严重影响。但由于工人英勇抢救，积极恢复，十月份各厂即已恢复正常生产，且生产效率显著提高。国营炼钢厂若以一九四八年每月平均生产指数为一百，则去年十二月铸钢产量为三百二十点五，钢条生产为三百九十点八五，耐火器材为三百八十三点二五。工人研究改进技术后，次钢并减少到百分之二点六。铁路工厂主要任务是修理机车和制造客、货车，以一九四八年月产量为基数，则去年十二月修理机车为百分之一百零四点三，新造客车为百分之三百十六点九，货车为百分之一百十五点三。工作日则与生产基数成反比例：修理机车用工相当一九四八年百分之七十点四，新制客车用工相当百分之四十六点一，货车用工相当百分之二十四。华北电业公司唐山发电厂去年十二月供电总量已超过一九四八年平均月供量的百分之十五。在公私合营和私营企业中，生产亦普遍提高。开滦煤矿按抗战以前年产五百万吨，每月平均产煤四十一万七千吨，煤工效率九百至一千公斤为正常生产情况。按去年十一、十二两月平均产量为四十三万五千吨，已达抗战以前生产水平，超过国民党统治时代月产三十五万五千八百三十二吨的百分之二十四。煤工效率总平均已达一千零五公斤，突破了九年来的生产纪录。陶瓷业为唐山主要特产，亦有相当的恢复和发展。其中尤以电瓷和卫生器皿为显著。公营启新磁厂一九四八年月产总值折合小米十七万一千四百九十三公斤，去年十一月生产总值折合小米三十三万二千七百十八公斤，超过解放前百分之九十五。华新纺织厂一九四八年平均月产布九八九、二○四件，产纱一、五二八、二二九件。去年十二月产布超过了解放前的百分之三十二，产纱超过百分之七点六。其他私营企业的生产情况除水泥生产因供求关系尚未接近战前水平外，其余均为唐山解放以来所未有。机器铁工业十月份修造的各种机件的数量，相当于六月以来每月平均数量的三倍。
    该市工业生产得以迅速恢复并超过解放前生产水平，主要是由于工人阶级觉悟的提高，积极改良工具提高生产技术，端正劳动态度和加强生产纪律教育的结果。各厂矿结合着生产运动的开展都热烈的开展了民主改革运动，部分的取消了国民党遗留下来的腐败的不合理的制度，如开滦取消了吸吮工人血汗的包工大柜和矿警制度的压迫，初步调整了职工工资过于悬殊的不合理现象；华新纺织厂、铁路工厂等取消了侮辱工人的“搜身”制；陶瓷业取消了窑课（烧缸的工资是分贷制，烧出后资方先挑好缸，其余的再与工人按比例分配）的非法剥削；唐山电业公司、德胜磁厂则调整了人事等。因而工人觉悟随之提高，新的劳动态度开始树立。正如华新纱厂女工说：“从前女人作工是为生活所迫，不懂生产为什么，工作也不好好干。现在大家都知道自己是主人了，出厂也不搜腰包了，孩子有人看管，有啥话也都可以说，所以生产都积极了。”一年来该市工人的主要发明和仿造、改造的新工具、机件就有一百十三种之多，解决了生产上的许多困难。如启新磁厂聘请德国技师研究多年而未成功的五吨二拉力高压悬垂电瓶，现在已能大量制造。铁路工厂向来依赖国外输入的风闸机，现在也可自己制造。德盛磁厂工人李春茂、周凤桐创造的电力轧砖机（制耐火砖的）日出砖一万七千块，比过去人力机每天轧砖一千五百块增加百分之一千一百四十。炼钢厂工人经过八次试修，把日寇和国民党统治时代没有试验成功的贝斯麦炉修好，可以直接由铁炼钢，解决了购买钢料的困难，并且四十分钟出一炉钢，提高产量数倍。
