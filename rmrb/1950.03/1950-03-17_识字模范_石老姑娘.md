　　Literacy Model "Old Lady Shi"
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Huangfu Jin

　　Her four children are all industrial workers. She is the top student in the women's literacy class. She supervises the entire family's learning. She says: "It is not okay not to labor well, and it is not okay not to study well."

　　In Taiyuan, I visited the forty-six-year-old literacy model "Old Lady Shi." She is the mother of Li Wang, a worker at a railway factory, and her husband, Li Fengming, was an old worker who passed away five years ago. In the past, people often wrote her name as Li Shi Shi, but when she signed up for the women's literacy class this time, she called herself "Old Lady Shi." Because she is a model student and was also elected as a district women's representative and neighborhood representative, everyone knows that "Old Lady Shi" is Li Wang's mother.

　　At 11:30 AM on March 1st, after the factory workers finished their shift, Li Wang led me to his home to visit his mother. What impressed me the most was her robust physique and the straightforward language and expressions that matched it. Li Wang pointed to the slate, chalk, books, pencils, and notebooks on the windowsill and said, "These are my mother's learning tools." He then pointed to the chalk writing on the wall and said, "These are the capital numbers written by my mother." His mother also said excitedly, "When I become literate, my whole family will be considered to have opened their eyes!" She counted on her fingers and talked about the family's studies: "This is my eldest child (referring to Li Wang), who studied for a few years when he was young, and his cultural level is the highest in the family. His wife, Li Xiuzhen, works in the same factory as him and attends the factory's literacy class. People say she is very exemplary. The eldest daughter is called Jin Cheng, she is eighteen years old, and the second daughter is called Jin Lan, she is fifteen years old. They both work in a chemical factory and participate in factory learning. Our family thinks Jin Cheng is the smartest; she stopped going to school when she was eleven, and she relies entirely on reading books and asking people. Now everyone says she's equivalent to a higher elementary school graduate. There is also a youngest child called Jin Bao, who goes to Beiguan Elementary School with me. I am in the literacy class, and he is in the second grade. He is greedy for play every day and doesn't want to put his heart into studying. To be honest, the reason why I, at such an old age, still want to study and become literate is to supervise them!"

　　At this time, I wanted to see her academic performance. She readily picked up the literacy textbook from the kang and flipped through it, saying, "The first volume has been completed. The second volume will only start after the school term begins, but I have already read ten or so lessons." Since the women's literacy class was started at Beiguan Elementary School, she has been going to school every day from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, and she hasn't missed a single class in the past few months. Although her housework is very busy (such as buying things, cooking, making coal mud, sewing clothes...), she takes advantage of any free time she has to read and write. She said: "At first, I couldn't even write the 'woman' character properly; I made up my mind, and I wrote it eight or ten times, wrote one well, and then wrote another. I wrote it well on the slate, and then I used a pencil to write it on paper. Now I can arrange the strokes evenly for even the most difficult characters." As she spoke, she took out a handbag. The first thing she took out was a small tin can, which contained an eraser, several pencil stubs, and a magnifying glass (which can enlarge the characters three or four times). The second thing she took out was a large roll of waste paper, which was filled with pencil and pen writing on both sides. The third thing she took out was her notebook and reference book (Worker's Literacy Textbook). She gave me a notebook that was already filled with writing. What surprised me was that the first page still had crooked large characters, but by the second half, it had become very neat small regular script. And in addition to the characters in the literacy textbook, she also wrote many political terms and slogans: such as "Bureaucratic Capitalism," "Petty Bourgeoisie," etc. She noted "Old Lady Shi" at the end of almost every page. Now, from not knowing a single character, she can already write five or six hundred characters from memory. She scored ninety-seven points on the winter vacation test and was the top student in the entire women's literacy class.

　　Here is a question: Why is she so enthusiastic about learning? She has a painful memory:

　　Her husband became a factory apprentice at the age of eleven. They were both from Beijing. For the sake of livelihood, they went to Taiyuan, then from Taiyuan to Baotou, Datong, and then back to Taiyuan, looking for factory work everywhere, but it was the same suffering everywhere. Because they already had five children at that time, although her husband was a skilled and technical worker in the locomotive department, he could not support the family. She herself set up a small stall at the factory gate to sell food. They felt the inconvenience of not being literate and decided to send their children to school, saving every penny to pay their tuition, but in the end, they all dropped out of school. The Japanese implemented "security reinforcement," and the workers ate black beans every day. Her husband died of illness in 1945 due to overwork and the epidemic! After her husband became ill, the factory immediately washed their hands of it. She burned incense and kowtowed every day, begging for gods and medicine, but it was all "in vain." This was a great shock to her. After the liberation of Taiyuan, their lives were guaranteed, and her eldest child became a cadre in the engineering department. Her daughter joined the Youth League, and she herself became a district representative. She said happily: "White flour won't fall from the sky, it's not okay not to labor well; it's not okay not to study well." Therefore, after work every evening, their whole family studies together, and everyone helps her to become literate, and they also discuss politics, studying until ten o'clock. After the children go to sleep, she tidies up the books, papers, and pens that everyone has left behind before officially starting her self-study. She studies until eleven o'clock every day. Li Xiuzhen—her daughter-in-law—often tells people: "One morning, I woke up and saw my mother draped in clothes, sitting in bed, busy with something. When I got up to take a look, it turned out that she was holding a slate and writing!"

　　识字模范“石老姑娘”
    本报特约通讯员  皇甫瑾
    她的四个儿女都是产业工人。她是妇女识字班的第一名好学生。她督促着全家的学习。她说：“不好好劳动不行，不好好学习也不行。”
    在太原，我拜访了四十六岁的识字模范“石老姑娘”。她是铁路工厂工人李旺的母亲，丈夫是老工人李凤鸣，已死去五年了。过去人常写她的名字叫李石氏，这次她报名参加妇女识字班的时候，自称为“石老姑娘”。因为她是学习模范，又被选为区妇女代表兼闾代表，所以提起“石老姑娘”四个字，谁都知道就是李旺的母亲。
    三月一日上午十一时半，工厂下工后，李旺引着我到家去拜访他的母亲。使我印象最深的，是她健壮的体格和与此相称的爽直的语言和表情。李旺指着窗台上的石板、粉笔、书本、铅笔和笔记本说：“这是我母亲的学习用具。”又指墙上的粉笔字说：“这是我母亲写的大写数字。”他母亲也很兴奋的说：“我要识了字，俺全家就算都睁开眼了！”她弯着手指头，谈起全家人的学习：“这是我大孩子（指李旺），小时念过几年书，一家的文化数他高。媳妇李秀珍，和他在一个厂做工，参加厂里识字班，人家说她很模范。大女孩叫晋成，十八岁，二女儿叫晋兰，十五岁，她俩都在化学厂做工，都参加工厂学习。俺一家数晋成心眼灵，她十一岁就不上学了，全凭自己看书、问人，如今人人说她顶个高小程度。还有一个最小的孩子叫晋保，和我都上北关完小学习，我在识字班，他在二年级，每天光贪耍，不想好好用心。我这么大年纪还要念书识字，实在说，也就是为着督促他们啊！”
    这时，我想看看她的学习成绩，她顺手从炕头上拿起民校识字课本来，翻了翻说：“第一册已讲完了。第二册开学后才开讲，可是我已念了十来课了。”自从上北关完小办起妇女识字班来，她每天下午一点钟到两点半，都要上学，几个月来，没有缺过一次课。虽然她的家务很忙（如买东西、做饭、弄煤泥、缝补衣服……），但抓个空子，她就看书写字。她说：“我开头连妇女的‘女’字也写不周正；我下了狠心，十次八次的写，写好一个，再写一个。在石板上写好了，就用铅笔在纸上写，现在很难写的字，我都能摆匀笔划了。”说着，她拿过一个手提包来，第一次取出来的是一个小洋铁筒，里边装着一块橡皮、几个铅笔头、还有一个放大镜（可扩大字形三四倍）。第二次取出的是一大卷废纸，在废纸的正面和反面，挤满了铅笔字和钢笔字。第三次取出来的，是她的笔记本和参考书（工人识字课本）。她把一个已经写满了的本子送给了我。使我惊讶的是第一页还是歪歪扭扭的大字，到后半部，已成了很整齐的小楷了。而且除了识字课本的字以外，还写了许多政治名词和口号：如“官僚资本主义”、“小资产阶级”等，差不多在每页的末尾，都注上“石老姑娘”四个字。现在她由一字不识，已能默写五六百字。寒假测验考了九十七分，是全妇女识字班的第一名。
    这里有一个问题，为什么她会这样热心的学习呢？她有一段痛苦的回忆：
    她的丈夫十一岁就当了工厂学徒。她们都是北京人。为了生活，她们到了太原，又从太原到包头、大同，然后又返回太原，到处找工厂做工，可是那里也一样受熬煎。因为那时已有了五个孩子，丈夫虽是机关车部一个熟练而有技术的工人，可是养活不了家。她自己就在工厂门口摆小摊子卖饭。她们感到不识字的不便，决心要让孩子们上学，自己省吃俭用，给他们掏学费，可是最后还是都失了学。日本人实行“治安强化”，工人天天吃黑豆，她丈夫因劳动过度，又遇瘟疫流行，不幸在一九四五年病死了！丈夫得病之后，工厂马上甩手不管。她每天烧香叩头，求神拜药，但一切都是“白搭”，这对她是一个很大的刺激。太原解放后，他们的生活有了保障，大孩子当了工务课的干部。女儿参加了青年团，她自己也当了区代表。她很高兴的说：“老天下不来白面，不好好劳动不行；不好好学习也不行。”因此每天晚上下班后，她们全家在一起学习，大家帮助她识字，还讨论政治，一直学到十点钟。孩子们都睡觉了，她把大家丢下的书本、纸、笔整理好以后，才正式的开始自习。每天是学习到十一点钟才罢。李秀珍——她的儿媳妇——常告人说：“我有一天早上醒来，看见我母亲披着衣服，坐在被窝里不知忙个什么。起来一看，原来她正抱着石板写字呢！”
