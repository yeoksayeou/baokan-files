　　This Spring's Afforestation
    Liang Xi
    This afforestation is the first since the liberation of mainland China, the first since the eradication of the evil forces of imperialism, feudal warlords, and comprador capitalists, and the first since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people, on independent and autonomous land, using their own labor for their own benefit to plant trees – its significance is greater than any other time.
    (1) Using Afforestation to Welcome the Spring of New China: The plan for a mountain lies in its forests, and the plan for a year lies in spring. Spring brings us vibrant life, transforming all things from old to new, from death to life, from yellow to green, representing unlimited prospects. It is not like the cold, despondent, bleak, and withered winter. It sends to nature the Grain Rain and Pure Brightness, the fine dew and sweet rain, the thriving of living things. If winter represents the perished old China, then the myriad things of spring symbolize the people of New China.
    New China itself is the spring of the people. In the frozen land, people felt dryness, tastelessness, coldness, and ruthlessness, looking forward and preparing to welcome the new spring every day. Now we have longed for it and welcomed it. Spring is truly before the people's eyes. People warmly welcome it, which is not a problem. The problem is: in what way should we welcome it? From the standpoint of forestry workers, we believe it is best to show it with facts. Let us be spirited, bring forth our strength, seize the opportunity, and, in line with the season, quickly and actively establish beautiful forests on the barren mountains and wastelands repeatedly destroyed by feudal lords and imperialists, to change the old face of our rivers and mountains and create a new environment for nature. This is a glorious task.
    As mentioned earlier, the newly born and the young will replace the old and the withered. Yes, this is the law of nature's development. However, people cannot wait for nature; they must strive for nature, promote nature, and thus transform nature. An inch of time is worth an inch of gold. Spring afforestation should be done early. The experience gained by afforestation workers in the field is worth our attention.
    This does not mean that afforestation is limited to spring. There are more opportunities for afforestation outside of spring, and sometimes the results are better than in spring. For example, in western Hebei, the survival rate of spring afforestation is 80%, while in the rainy season it is 90%. Similarly, in Chahar, the survival rate in spring is 70%, in the rainy season 80%, and in autumn around 90%. As for the South, there are more afforestation opportunities outside of spring.
    However, spring afforestation still occupies an important position throughout the country. Moreover, spring is the beginning of the year. The spirit is all in the beginning. Especially this year, we are fortunate to encounter the first spring after the founding of the People's Republic of China. We should create, among thousands upon thousands of seedlings, a large, complete, and most memorable annual ring that represents the history of plant growth, not the history of social development.
    (2) Using Afforestation to Reduce Natural Disasters: The year 1949 was the year with the most and greatest disasters in recent decades. The facts tell us, warn us, and teach us to immediately fight nature—afforestation. Otherwise, we will be swallowed by sand and water.
    According to the trend of nature, mountain soil would originally move downwards continuously, but due to the coverage of grass and trees, the soil and rocks are protected, thus extending the change of terrain indefinitely. Barren mountains are different. Without ground cover, there is no protection, and fertile soil is lost year by year. So, the mountains are full of sand, the ground is full of sand, the sky is full of flying sand, and the water flowing is also full of sand.
    Because the water is full of flowing sand, rivers and seas are turning yellow. The sand content of the Yellow River and the Liu River in western Liaoning reaches up to about 50%. Because the river is half water and half sand, the river water half flows and half stagnates, and the river channel is half open and half blocked, constantly changing its course, causing floods. As far as the Yellow River is concerned, historical records are very clear: there are about four breaches every ten years. Some say that the average annual loss, calculated at pre-war prices, is about 25 million silver dollars. And the great flood of 1949 inundated 100 million mu of cultivated land nationwide, reduced grain production by 120 billion jin, and created 40 million disaster victims. This is a serious warning: China's afforestation cannot be delayed any longer. The ancients said: "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will human life last?" This means that the river will never be clear. However, to eliminate or reduce floods, the river must be cleared, and theoretically, the river can be cleared completely or partially, depending on the mountains and forests at the source and in the basin. At this forestry business conference, the task of foresters mentioned in the report by representative Sun Linfu included "turning the Yellow River into a green river," which coincides with what I thought a few years ago in Chongqing. At that time, I said in the "Lin Zhong" publication: "The Yellow River flows with green water, and the barren land turns into green mountains." I hope that New China will carry out large-scale and rapid afforestation to prove our ideals.
    Due to the accumulation of sand and soil on the ground, from Chahar through Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, to Xinjiang, sand dunes are everywhere, and the land is barren and the people are poor. Among them, the deserts of Xinjiang are even more vast. Farmland, forest land, and pasture land only account for 4.1% to 4.5% of the province's total area, and more than 95% of the land is covered by sand and not easily utilized (representative Sima Yi's report). The area of sandy land in Xinjiang is almost equal to four Sichuan provinces, or twelve Jiangsu provinces. Although the above is not entirely man-made, historical deforestation is also one of the root causes.
    If the sand and soil in the Northwest and North are always fixed and do not move, then the sand damage would only be limited to this area. However, due to constant sunshine and wind, flying sand continues to spread far, creating a terrible "southward shift of the desert," and sand disasters are spreading widely. Representative Sun Linfu said: There are four "many" things in the Northwest: many winds, many sands, many wastelands, and many disasters, and the many winds and sands are continuous throughout the year. This is the front-line scene of flying sand. Representative Huang Shu said: The wind and sand in Xinle County, Hebei Province, are very harmful. On April 4, 1949, a strong wind blew for a day, and more than 190,000 mu of wheat and pea fields in the county were damaged. This is the rear of flying sand. As a result of the desert shifting southward, the Chinese population has also gradually developed southward with the changes of history. The prosperous capital thousands of years ago is very desolate today, and the rear of sand damage thousands of years ago has become the front line today. How terrible is this! Fortunately, Chinese history has completely reversed, otherwise, if the mountains and forests continue to be destroyed and the desert continues to shift southward, where will the Chinese people go?
    In short, we must start from spring, from this spring, and actively carry out afforestation, do what we say, to reduce China's disasters.
    (3) Using Afforestation to Prepare Industrial Resources: The more progress China makes, the more modern it becomes, the more industrialized it becomes, and the more it moves towards construction, the more timber it needs. Although developed industrial countries have steel, plastics, and various other man-made products that can replace wood, the use of wood is still increasing. This has been the trend in the past twenty years.
    We can get a general idea by looking at the timber trade relations between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States in 1937. Britain is a country lacking timber. Its forest land, including Ireland, only accounts for 4% of the total area, and its industry is developed, so it needs timber very much and must import it from foreign countries. The Soviet Union is near Britain. In terms of timber resources, it ranks first among the world's five major timber producers, surpassing Canada, the United States, Finland, and Sweden. In terms of harvesting, transportation, and the timber industry, the Soviet Union is also the most highly mechanized, surpassing Canada and the United States, and can produce a large amount of lumber every year. However, in 1937, Soviet timber accounted for 21.5% of the total amount of coniferous lumber imported by Britain from overseas, which was less than the 24.1% imported from Finland. What is the reason for this? According to British foresters, the Soviet Union's several five-year plans after the revolution promoted emerging industries and expanded the use of timber. Despite using highly mechanized methods for harvesting, transportation, and processing, it still could not produce enough timber to export abroad in addition to meeting domestic needs. Similarly, because the United States needs a lot of timber for its own industry, the amount of timber it imported to Britain in 1937 only accounted for 2.5% of Britain's total imports.
    From this, it can be seen that the consumption of timber is directly proportional to the development of construction projects. Mainland China was liberated not long ago, and the military affairs in the interior have just ended, but the need for timber has been urgently placed on the agenda, and the future is even more imaginable. Let’s just talk about railway sleepers: last year, 90% of the 3.5 million cubic meters of timber produced in Northeast China was used for sleepers, of which 70% was supplied to Guan Nei (the area within the Shanhaiguan Pass), and 20% was left in the Northeast. The total length of existing railways in our country, including Taiwan and Hainan Island, is 26,857 kilometers. Assuming that a sleeper is placed every two feet, there are more than 40 million railway sleepers nationwide. Assuming that the service life of sleepers is five years and one-fifth is replaced every year, then according to the existing railways, more than 8 million sleepers are needed every year. Next is wood pulp: according to the report of the preparatory committee of the first national paper conference of the Ministry of Light Industry, it is estimated that within five years, the amount of paper consumed by each person per year in China will increase to 1.5 kilograms (now it is only 400 grams), then the annual demand for paper will be 600,000 tons, therefore, 650,000 tons of pulp are needed. Among these 650,000 tons of pulp, 200,000 tons are mechanical wood pulp, requiring 600,000 cubic meters of timber, and 200,000 tons are chemical wood pulp, requiring 1 million to 1.2 million cubic meters of timber, totaling 1.6 million to 1.8 million cubic meters of timber per year. Therefore, the output of pulp in New China is certainly a problem, but the timber required for pulp is an even bigger problem. In addition, mine timber, utility poles, matchsticks, etc., are all in short supply.
    Therefore, from 1950 onwards, the amount of timber used will inevitably increase with the development of industry. To supplement the consumption of timber, afforestation must be carried out immediately without hesitation.
    Welcoming the new, rescuing from disasters, and supplying industrial timber are just a few examples. In addition, the importance of forests to New China is too numerous to mention. In this great era, I think no one doubts the need to emphasize afforestation. What is doubtful is that China has 3.92 billion mu of suitable land for afforestation, but this year's afforestation plan will probably create no more than 1.6 million mu (excluding hillside closure for forest cultivation). At this rate, I wonder how many years it will take to green China? Yes, we also have this feeling. However, we are not discouraged. Our hope lies in the future. From a national perspective, this year is still the first year to start from scratch on a weak forestry foundation. Chairman Mao said: "The Long March has taken the first step." We are just about to lift one foot, and we haven't started walking yet. However, this step must be taken, and we must be careful in taking it. Why? Because it is the first step! Because it is the first step on the long march.

　　这一次的春季造林
    梁希
    这一次造林，是中国大陆解放以后的第一次，是帝国主义和封建魔王以及大买办互相结合的恶势力消灭以后的第一次，是中华人民共和国成立以后的第一次。中国人民，在独立自主的土地上，为自己的利益，用自己的劳力来造林，其意义比任何一次重大。
    （一）用造林来迎接新中国的春天：一山之计在于林，一年之计在于春。春，替我们带来了活泼的生命，使万象由旧而新，由死而生，由黄而青，表示着无限的前程。它不像冬天一样的冷酷，消沉，肃杀，凋零。它送给大自然界的，是谷雨和清明，是嘉露和甘霖，是生物的欣欣向荣。如果说，冬天代表灭亡了的旧中国，那么，春天的万事万物，就象征着新中国的人民。
    新中国本身就是人民的春天。在冰天雪地里，人们曾感觉到干燥无味和冷酷无情，天天盼望，天天准备迎接新春。现在已经盼到了，迎到了，春天真在人们的眼前，人们热烈地欢迎，是不成问题的，问题是在：用何种方式欢迎？站在林业工作者的立场，我们以为最好用事实表现，提起精神来，拿出力量来，抓紧机会，针对时令，迅速地，积极地，在被封建主和帝国主义一再破坏了的荒山荒地上，建立起美丽的森林，为河山改变旧面貌，为大自然创造新环境。这是一种光荣的任务。
    前面说，新生的和年青的东西，会代替老死的和枯黄的。是的，这是大自然发展的规律。不过，人们不能等待自然，人们必须争取自然，促进自然，从而改造自然。韶光一刻值千金，春季造林宜乎早，造林工作者从实地所得的经验，值得我们重视的。
    这不是意味着造林仅限于春季。春季以外，造林的机会还多，并且成绩有时还比春季好。例如冀西，春季造林的成活率百分之八○，雨季百分之九○，又如察哈尔，春季成活率百分之七○，雨季百分之八○，秋季百分之九○左右。至于南方，春季以外，造林机会更多。
    然而春季造林，在全国还是占着重要的地位。而且，春天是一年的开始，一鼓作气，精神全在最初。尤其是今年，千载一时地幸逢中华人民共和国成立后的第一个春天，我们应该在千千万万棵苗木中，造成一个表示植物生长史，不表示社会发展史的最圆满最完全最值得纪念的大年轮。
    （二）用造林来减少灾荒：一九四九年是最近数十年来灾荒最多最大的一年，事实告诉我们，警戒我们，教我们立即和大自然斗争——造林，不然，我们会被砂和水吞没。
    依照大自然的趋势，山土本来不断地会向下方移动的，而由于草木之被覆，土石得到一重保障，地形的改变因而无限期地延长。荒山可不同了，既无地被，便无保护，沃土逐年流失。于是满山是砂，满地是砂，天空飞的是砂，水中流的又是砂。
    由于水中饱含流砂，所以江，河，海都成黄色。黄河和辽西柳河的含砂量，最高达百分之五十左右。因为河中半水半砂，所以河水半流半滞，河道半通半塞，时时改变流向，造成水灾。就黄河而论，历史记载得很清楚，大约每十年有四次决口，有人说，每年平均损失，按战前物价计算，约二千五百万元硬币。而一九四九年的大水灾，全国被淹耕地一万万亩，减产粮食一百二十万万斤，产生灾民四千万人。这是一个严重的警告：中国造林不容再缓了。古人说：“俟河之清，人寿几何？”这是说，河是永远不会清的。然而要免除或减少水灾，河是必须要澄清的，而且照理论讲，河是可以全部或局部澄清的，这，只要看河源与流域的山林如何。这次林业业务会议，在孙麟符代表的报告中所提出的林业家任务内，有“把黄河变成绿河”一句话，这与我几年前在重庆时所想的不谋而合。那时，我在《林钟》刊物上说过：“黄河流碧水，赤地变青山”。但愿新中国大量地迅速地造林，来证实我们的理想罢。
    由于地面上砂土的堆积，所以从察哈尔起，经绥远，宁夏，甘肃，直到新疆，都是砂碛弥漫，地瘠民贫。就中，新疆的沙漠，浩瀚更甚。农地，林地和牧草地只占全省总面积之百分之四·一到四·五，其余百分之九五以上之土地，被砂掩盖而不易利用（司马益代表报告）。新疆砂地的面积，几乎等于四个四川，或等于十二个江苏。以上所说，虽然不全是由人工造成，然历史性的森林摧残，也是祸根之一。
    假如西北和北方的砂土永远固定而不动，那么，砂害也不过限定这一带罢了。无奈时时日晒，风吹，飞砂不断远扬，造成了可怕的“砂漠南移”，沙灾于是广泛地蔓延。孙麟符代表说：西北有四多，风多砂多，荒地多，灾害多，而风砂之多，则更终年不断。这是飞砂的前线景象。黄舒代表说：河北新乐县风砂为害甚大，一九四九年四月四日刮了一天大风，全县十九万多亩麦田和豌豆地都遭到灾害。这又是飞砂的大后方景象。沙漠由北南移的结果，中国人口亦随历史的变迁，有逐渐向南发展的趋势，数千年前繁华的京都，今天已非常荒凉，数千年前砂害的大后方，今天竟变成前线，这是何等可怕！而幸，中国历史完全扭转了，不然，山林继续破坏，砂漠继续南移，中国人将往何处走？
    总而言之，我们必须从春天起，从这一个春天起，积极造林，说做就做，以减少中国的灾荒。
    （三）用造林来准备工业资源：中国越进步，越近代化，越工业化，越向建设方面迈进，则需要木材越多。尽管工业发达的国家，有钢和塑料以及其他各种人造品可以代替木材，而木材的用途还是有增无减。这是最近二十年来的趋势。
    我们只要看一九三七年英、苏、美三国的木材贸易关系，就可以得到一个大概。英国是一个木材缺乏的国家，它的林地面积包括爱尔兰在内，只占总面积之百分之四，而工业又发达，所以需要木材甚切，必需由外国输入。苏联在英国的附近，论木材资源，它占着世界五大木材生产国之第一位，为加拿大，美国，芬兰和瑞典四国所不及。论采运与木材工业，则苏联又是最高度的机械化，胜过加拿大与美国，每年可以生产大量的制材。然而一九三七年英国从海外输入之针叶树制材的总量中，苏联材占百分之二一·五，反比芬兰材输入量的百分之二四·一为少。这是什么原因呢？据英国林学家说：苏联革命后几个五年计划，促进了新兴工业，扩张了木材用途，尽管用高度机械化的方式来采运和加工，还不能在满足本国需要之外，有过多的木材输出国外。同样，美国也因为本国工业需要木材甚多，所以一九三七年输入英国的材量，只占英国的总输入量之百分之二·五。
    由此可见，木材之销费量，与建设事业之发达成正比例。中国大陆解放不久，内地军事刚刚结束，而木材的需要，已迫切地列在日程单上，此后更可想而知。单说铁路枕木：去年东北木材产量三百五十万立方米之中，有百分之九○作枕木之用，就中，百分之七○供给关内，百分之二○留在东北。我国现有铁路包括台湾和海南岛在内，总长二六，八五七公里，假定每隔二英尺布置一根枕木，则全国铁路枕木共有四千多万根。假定枕木寿命五年，每年换五分之一，则照现成的铁路计算，每年已需要八百多万根。次说木浆：据轻工业部首届全国纸张会议筹备会报告，估计五年之内，中国每人每年消耗纸量增加到一·五公斤（现在只四○○公分），则年需纸张六○万吨，因此需纸浆六五万吨。此六五万吨纸浆中，有二○万吨是机械木浆，需木材六○万立方米，有二○万吨是化学木浆，需木材一○○万至一二○万立方米，每年共需木材一六○万至一八○万立方米。所以，新中国的纸浆产量，固然是一个问题，而纸浆所需的木材，问题更大。此外，矿木、电杆、火柴杆等，到处都感到供不应求。
    所以，从一九五○年起，木材用量，必跟着工业的发展而增加。为补充木材的消耗量起见，也必须即时造林，不容迟疑。
    迎新，救灾荒，供给工业用材，不过举出数端而已。此外，森林对于新中国之重要性，还书不胜书。在这个大时代里强调造林，我想没有人怀疑，所可疑者，中国宜林地有三十九亿二千万市亩，而本年度之造林计划，恐至多不过造成一百六十万市亩（封山育林在外），照这样的进度，不知何年何月才能绿化全中国？是的，我们也正有此感。不过，我们并不气短，我们的希望在后来，从全国范围内说，今年还是在薄弱的林业基础上从头做起的第一年。毛主席说过：“万里长征走完了第一步”。我们现在一只脚刚刚要提起，还没有走。然而这一步一定要走的，一定要留神走的。为什么？因为是第一步！因为是万里征途上的第一步。
