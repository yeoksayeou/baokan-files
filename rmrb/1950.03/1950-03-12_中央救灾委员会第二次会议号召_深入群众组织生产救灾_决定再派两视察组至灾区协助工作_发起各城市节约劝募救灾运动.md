Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th: The Central Disaster Relief Committee held its second meeting today. In addition to the heads of relevant central departments, the heads of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Liberated Areas Relief General Association attended. The meeting was chaired by Vice Premier Dong Biwu, and the organizational rules of the Central Disaster Relief Committee were adopted. After hearing reports from Vice Premier Dong and the Ministry of Interior on the current disaster relief situation, the meeting unanimously agreed that although the disaster situation in some areas has shown a tendency to stop developing due to intensified work, the disaster situation in some areas is still very serious. The disaster relief policy has been repeatedly instructed by the Central People's Government, and most areas have clarified it. The Central People's Government has now allocated a large amount of grain and rushed it to the disaster areas. Therefore, the main issue now is how to deeply organize the masses and carry out production for disaster relief in various places. In order to further understand the disaster situation and the progress of disaster relief work, and to assist in promoting disaster relief work in various places, the meeting decided to organize two more inspection teams, led by Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the People's Supervisory Committee, and Wu Xinyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Interior, to Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, and Pingyuan and Northern Anhui, respectively. The meeting believes that since the launch of the economy and disaster relief campaign, the movement of saving two liang or one liang of rice in various agencies and troops has achieved considerable results and is continuing. This movement should be extended to the masses from all walks of life to strengthen support for the disaster areas. Finally, the representative of the All-China Women's Federation attending the meeting proposed launching a city-wide economy and fundraising disaster relief campaign, which was unanimously approved by the meeting. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the Liberated Areas Relief General Association and other units were designated to initiate and coordinate this movement with all parties.

　　中央救灾委员会第二次会议号召
    深入群众组织生产救灾
    决定再派两视察组至灾区协助工作
    发起各城市节约劝募救灾运动
    【新华社北京十一日电】中央救灾委员会于今日举行第二次会议，除中央各有关部门负责人外，并有全国总工会、全国青联、全国妇联、解放区救济总会等单位负责人出席。会议由董必武副总理主持，通过了中央救灾委员会组织简则。会议听取了董副总理及内务部关于目前救灾情况报告后，一致认为：目前灾情虽然在有些地区由于加紧深入工作，有停止发展的趋势，但有些地区灾情仍很严重。救灾方针经中央人民政府一再指示，各地多已明确。中央人民政府现又拨出大批粮食，赶运至灾区。故今后主要是各地如何深入组织群众，进行生产救灾问题。为了进一步了解灾情及救灾工作状况，协助推动各地救灾工作，会议决定再组织两个视察组，由人民监察委员会刘景范副主任及内务部武新宇副部长分别率领，一赴山东、苏北，一赴平原、皖北。会议认为：自发起节约救灾运动以来，各地机关部队节约二两米、一两米运动，已收不少成绩，并正继续进行。这种运动应推广到各界群众中去，以加强支援灾区。会议最后由全国妇联出席会议代表提议发起各城市节约劝募救灾运动，当经会议全体同意，并推定全国总工会、全国青联、全国妇联、解放区救济总会等单位发起，协同各方面组织这一运动。
