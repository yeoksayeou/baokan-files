Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: According to a TASS report from The Hague: The Dutch people are protesting the Dutch authorities' outrageous act of insulting the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress on February 28th.

The delegation of the World Peace Congress came to the Netherlands to present peace proposals to the country's parliament. The delegation included members of parliament from Italy and France. When they approached the Dutch Parliament Building on February 28th, Dutch police brazenly and unreasonably arrested them and took them to the police station. During the "interrogation," they were subjected to the utmost humiliation. They were detained in the police station for almost twenty-four hours without food. On the evening of March 1st, the Dutch authorities expelled them from the country.

The working people of Amsterdam held a meeting on the evening of February 28th, resolutely protesting the Dutch authorities' barbaric treatment of the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress.

　　荷兰反动政府害怕和平
    竟无理侮辱和大代表团     
    各地劳动人民愤慨抗议
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰人民抗议荷兰当局于二月二十八日侮辱世界和平大会常设委员会代表团的暴行。
    和大代表团到荷兰来，是为了向该国国会提出和平建议。代表团中有意大利和法国的国会议员。当他们于二月二十八日走近荷兰国会大厦时，荷兰警察竟然蛮横无理地将他们拘捕到警察局去。在“讯问”时，极尽侮辱之能事。他们在警局被拘禁了几乎二十四小时，而且不给东西吃。三月一日晚，荷兰当局将他们逐出国境。
    阿姆斯特丹的劳动人民，已于二月二十八日晚举行大会，坚决抗议荷兰当局对待世界和平大会常设委员会代表团的野蛮态度。
