　　越南文协中央执委会
    电中苏等国文艺工作者致敬
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十日讯：越南文艺工作者协会中央执行委员会于上月初举行第三次扩大会议时，曾向中、苏、朝、波、捷、罗、匈与德意志民主共和国等友好国家的文艺工作者通电致敬。电文称：越南文艺工作者热烈欢呼越南与各兄弟国家间外交关系的建立。我们非常满意于能够看到兄弟国家的人民，团结在一个阵营里，保卫由苏联领导的世界和平与民主。这个历史性事件也开辟了我们友好民族间的文化关系的新纪元。由于将来我们各国间的文化与代表团的互相交换，各国人民的文化定将日渐兴隆。越南和你们国家的文艺工作者，一定能在动员世界人民以粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗们的侵略阴谋上，得到成功，并能胜利地消除帝国主义者正在世界各地强加于人民的愚昧和麻醉的文艺。
