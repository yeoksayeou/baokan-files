Regarding the Publication of Photographs

On February 15th, the first page of the Changjiang Daily published a huge photograph of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, and Marshal Stalin and Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to commemorate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. However, it made an extremely crude mistake: substituting the photograph of another person for that of Vyshinsky. The same mistake had already occurred once on January 23rd when the newspaper published Vyshinsky's rebuttal of Acheson's statement. After discovering these errors, the newspaper decided to issue a correction and apology in the paper and publish the photograph of Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the same time.

The photograph of Chairman Mao published by the newspaper on February 15th was also not strictly selected, replacing a suitable photograph with an unsuitable one. On February 17th, the newspaper again mistakenly used a portrait of Zhukov as a portrait of Chuikov.

On March 5th, the first page of the Nanjing Xinhua Daily published a photograph of Chairman Mao when reporting the news of Chairman Mao's return to Beijing. The original photograph faced to the right, but the editorial department, for the sake of arrangement, "conveniently" flipped the photograph over, making it face to the left. As a result, this photograph did not conform to Chairman Mao's appearance.

These errors tell every newspaper that: First, the editorial department must have specialized personnel to manage photographs, who should be constantly responsible for the collection, appraisal, photography, reproduction, registration, plate-making, and printing of photographs. Second, editors and proofreaders should not only be responsible for the text on the newspaper but also for the photographs and illustrations.

　　关于刊登照片
    二月十五日长江日报第一版为刊载中苏友好同盟互助条约而刊出了毛主席与周恩来总理、斯大林大元帅与维辛斯基外长的巨幅照片时，犯了一个极其粗鲁的错误：把另一个人的照片代替了维辛斯基的照片。同一的错误在一月二十三日该报登载维辛斯基驳斥艾奇逊声明时已经发生过一次。该报在发现了这些错误以后，已经决定在报纸上更正和道歉，并将维辛斯基外长的照片同时刊登出来。
    二月十五日该报所刊毛主席照片也没有经严格的选择，把不适当的照片代替了适当的。二月十七日该报又把朱可夫的画像借用作崔可夫的画像。
    三月五日南京新华日报第一版在刊载毛主席返抵北京的消息同时，刊出了毛主席的照片。这张照片本来是面向右方的，该报编辑部为了排列的需要，却“方便”地把照片翻了过来，使之面向左方。结果这张照片就与毛主席的面容不符合了。
    这些错误告诉每一个报纸的：编辑部第一，编辑部必须有管理照片的专门人员，他应当经常负责照片的收集，鉴定、摄制、复制、登记，制版和付印；第二，编辑和校对人员不但应当负责报纸上的文字，而且应当负责报纸上的照片和图画。
