　　Romanian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ana Pauker, wrote an article in Izvestia commemorating the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Romanian democratic government, stating: The democratic fruits of Romania were nourished by the blood of Soviet soldiers and Romanian communists. The Romanian reactionaries, colluding with the king, landlords, and capitalists, and incited by American and British imperialists, prepared a rebellion, attempting to seize these fruits. The Communist Party guarded the interests of the working people, consolidated relations with the Soviet Union, and, as a result of the unwavering determination and unity of the democratic forces, overthrew two reactionary governments with a majority in four months (referring to the successive overthrow of the Sanatescu and Rădescu governments from December 1944 to March 1945), and established a democratic regime on March 6, 1945, permanently eliminating the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and landlords. In commemorating this day, we must be vigilant against the conspiracies of the American and British warmongers against our country and world peace. Our vigilance should be directed against the exploiters in urban and rural areas who have not yet been eliminated, and also against the Titoist spy agencies of American and British imperialism.

　　纪念民主政府建立五周年
    罗京举行盛会
    格罗查讲苏军解放罗国意义
    【新华社北京八日电】综合塔斯社消息：罗京布加勒斯特于六日举行庆祝罗马尼亚战胜反动派及建立以格罗查为首的民主政府的五周年纪念大会，罗总理格罗查及工人党总书记乔治乌——德治等均出席。格罗查讲演指出：苏军解放罗国，使罗马尼亚人民有可能成立了民主政府。并称：罗马尼亚工人党是罗马尼亚人民共和国的领导力量，它在罗马尼亚人民所获得的成就中起着决定性的作用。大会一致通过向斯大林大元帅致敬电。
            波克撰文指出：要警惕美英战贩破坏和平阴谋
    罗马尼亚部长会议副主席兼外交部长安娜·波克在消息报撰文纪念罗马尼亚民主政府成立五周年称：罗马尼亚的民主果实是以苏军战士和罗马尼亚的共产党员的鲜血滋润成长的。罗马尼亚反动派曾纠合国王、地主、资本家，在美英帝国主义者的煽动下准备叛乱，妄图攫取这些果实。共产党警卫了劳动人民的利益，巩固了对苏关系，由于民主力量坚定不移和团结的结果，在四个月内推翻了两个反动派占多数的政府（按指一九四四年十二月至一九四五年三月先后推翻沙那德斯库与拉杰斯库的两届政府），在一九四五年三月六日建立了民主政权，永久消灭了资产阶级和地主的独裁。在纪念这个日子时，我们要警惕美英战争贩子对我国和世界和平的阴谋，我们的警觉性应针对着尚未消灭的城乡剥削者，也应针对着美英帝国主义的铁托特务机关。
