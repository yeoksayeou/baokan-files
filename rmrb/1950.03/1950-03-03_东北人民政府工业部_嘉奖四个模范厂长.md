Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th – The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government recently issued a circular commending four model factory directors for their outstanding performance in managing factories. Among the four commended factory directors, She Ping, director of Harbin Cement Plant, Dong Chen, director of Jilin Shixian Paper Mill, and Liu Tianda, director of Andong Paper Mill, each received a First-Class Medal, while Ding Hong, director of Benxi Xiaotun Cement Plant, received a Second-Class Medal.

Under the leadership of Director She Ping, the output and quality of cement at the Harbin Cement Plant have continuously improved, creating a new record last year that exceeded the quality standards of the puppet Manchukuo by two times. Over the past two years, the plant has trained a large number of cadres, solving the cadre needs of the Cement Company in restoring and taking over the South Manchurian cement plants. The plant pays close attention to professional learning, and many workers have learned elementary algebra in their cultural studies.

The Shixian Paper Mill, led by Dong Chen, began to preliminarily implement quota management in August last year and, based on the actual situation, formulated regulations for protecting machinery safety, managing raw material consumption, inspecting product quality, and compiling workshop reports and statistics, enabling the plant's management to quickly get on the right track. After launching the new production record movement in October last year, the plant correctly implemented a piece-rate and time-based bonus wage system, further increasing the enthusiasm of the workers, resulting in a large increase in paper production. In the past, wooden steaming vats could only steam more than thirty tons of raw materials per day, but now they can guarantee more than fifty tons per day. Dust and other impurities in the plant's pulp have also been reduced by 80% compared to the past, improving the quality of the paper.

Liu Tianda, director of Andong Paper Mill, paid attention to uniting with trade union cadres and Party branch members in his work, closely cooperating to improve production equipment, and constantly promoting the development of the new record movement. As a result, the plant achieved a performance exceeding the production plan by 15% last year.

The Xiaotun Cement Plant, thanks to Director Ding Hong's dedicated study of advanced Soviet factory management experience and his ability to unite technical personnel and workers, achieved success in increasing production and reducing costs.

　　东北人民政府工业部
    嘉奖四个模范厂长
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北人民政府工业部最近通报嘉奖管理工厂成绩优良的四位模范厂长。被嘉奖的四个厂长中，哈尔滨水泥厂长射平、吉林石岘造纸厂长董晨、安东造纸总厂厂长刘天达各获一等奖章一枚，本溪小屯水泥厂厂长丁鸿获二等奖章一枚。哈尔滨水泥厂在厂长射平的领导下，水泥的产量和质量不断提高，去年创造了超过伪满质量标准二倍的新纪录。两年多来，该厂曾培养出大批干部，解决了水泥公司在恢复与接收南满各水泥厂时的干部需要。该厂对业务学习抓得很紧，许多工人在文化学习方面已学到了小代数。董晨领导的石岘造纸厂于去年八月间就开始初步实行了定额管理，并按照实际情况，订定了保护机械安全、原材料消耗管理、产品质量检查、车间表报统计等制度，使该厂管理迅速走向正轨。去年十月间开展创造生产新纪录运动后，该厂又正确实行了计件与计时超额奖励工资制，使工人的积极性益加提高，纸的产量因以大增。过去蒸原料的木釜，每天仅能蒸出三十多吨，现在每日可保证蒸出五十吨以上。该厂纸浆中的尘埃等杂质，亦较过去减少了百分之八十，提高了纸的质量。安东造纸总厂厂长刘天达在工作中注意和工会干部及党的支部团结一致，密切配合改进生产设备，不断地推动了新纪录运动的发展，因此，该厂去年得到了超过生产计划百分之十五的成绩。小屯水泥厂由于厂长丁鸿用心学习先进的苏联管理工厂经验，并善于团结技术人员和工人，获得了提高生产和降低成本的成绩。
