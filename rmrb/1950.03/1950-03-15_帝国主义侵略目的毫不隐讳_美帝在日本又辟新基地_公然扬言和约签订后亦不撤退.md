Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th: According to TASS Tokyo, March 13th: The United States Navy Department announced the opening of an air base for naval aircraft in Oppama (approximately 35 miles southeast of Tokyo) within the Yokosuka Naval Base area. A detachment of Marines will be stationed at this base. At the ceremony marking the commencement of operations at Oppama base, Yoe, Commander of the US Far East Naval Air Force, stated: Oppama will be an important component of the US naval facilities in the Far East.

According to Associated Press, the order issued by the US occupation authorities to the officers and men at Oppama base stated: "Their work is to support the policies of the Supreme Commander (referring to MacArthur)." The US Navy Department claimed: The United States hopes to retain Oppama base as its "major Far East outpost" after the treaty is signed (United Press). This shows that the US imperialists have made no secret of their aggressive aims in establishing military bases in Japan.

　　帝国主义侵略目的毫不隐讳  美帝在日本又辟新基地
    公然扬言和约签订后亦不撤退
    【新华社北京十四日电】据塔斯社东京十三日讯：美国海军部宣布在横须贺海军基地区内的追滨（按在东京东南约三十五英里）开辟了一个海军飞机用的空军基地，一队海军陆战队将驻扎在这个基地。美国远东海军空军司令约埃在开始使用追滨基地的典礼上称：追滨将是美国在远东海军设施的一个重要的组成部分。
    另据美联社讯，美国占领当局对追滨基地官兵所下的命令称：“他们的工作是支持最高统帅（指麦克阿瑟）的政策”。美国海军部则声称：美国希望在和约签订后保留追滨基地作为它的“远东主要前哨”（合众社）。这表明美帝国主义分子已毫不隐讳他们在日本建立军事基地的侵略目的。
