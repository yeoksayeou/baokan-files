　　Fengtai Locomotive Depot Achieves 200,000 Kilometers of Accident-Free Operation During Safety Operation Month; Crew Members' Sense of Responsibility Universally Improved
    [Our Newspaper] In the safety operation month, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot created an unprecedented glorious new record of 200,000 kilometers of safe operation from February 4th to March 7th. In the past, the depot's safe operation was generally 50,000 to 60,000 kilometers, and even at its highest, it did not exceed 70,000 to 80,000 kilometers. The achievement this time is mainly due to a focused inspection of the causes of past accidents, the determination of methods to improve work, and the increased sense of responsibility of the crew members. In the past, crew members focused on locomotive maintenance and neglected safety. They only paid attention to "speed" and not to "stability." In addition, leading cadres did not pay close attention to the work, did not establish standard operating procedures for crew members, and rewards and punishments were not strict or timely, so crew members' work was lax, and accidents easily occurred. In response to the above shortcomings, in-depth education was conducted among the crew members, and fifteen standard operating procedures for crew members were formulated; and an inspection team composed of the depot chief, operations director, and driver instructors, etc., conducted spot checks at various stations day and night. For example, the depot chief deliberately set the signal machine at Langfang to an insufficient degree to examine whether the crew members confirmed the signal and to observe the speed of the train approaching the station. Before train No. 1820 departed, driver instructor Yu Ziqi closed one of the air pumps to check whether the crew members' inspection of the locomotive was thorough. Due to the strengthening of the crew members' sense of responsibility and vigilance, crew members created many exemplary deeds during the safety operation month. For example, on February 15th, when train No. 727 was being watered and cleaned at the Tianjin Locomotive Depot, the fire hook was stuck on the grate and could not be removed. Coincidentally, they received an order to take train No. 726 back to Fengtai. At that time, it was close to the departure time. In order to ensure on-time departure, stoker Wang Kun braved the high heat and crawled into the ash box, using a hand hammer to knock out the fire hook, finally allowing the train to depart on time. Another example is that when train No. 7597 was shunting at Zhoukoudian, the locomotive injector suddenly stopped supplying water. At that time, there were no locomotives at Liulihe, and the train from Fengtai could not arrive in time. Han Zhechang and others, the water pump drivers of the Liulihe car depot, rushed to repair it late at night after hearing the news, thus preventing an accident.
    To celebrate the establishment of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the depot is now launching a second 200,000-kilometer safety campaign. The locomotive crews, train operators, and others throughout the depot are actively formulating their respective plans and proposing guarantee conditions, and their morale is extremely high.

　　丰台机务段在安全运转月中
    行车廿万公里无事故
    乘务员工作责任心普遍提高
    【本报讯】丰台机务段在安全运转月中，由二月四日到三月七日，创造了安全运行二十万公里的空前光辉新纪录。过去该段安全运行一般是五、六万公里，最高也超不过七、八万公里。这次成绩的获得，主要是由于着重的检查了过去发生事故的原因，确定了改进工作的方法，并提高了乘务员的责任心。过去由于乘务员偏重于机车的保养，忽视安全。只注意“快”，不注意“稳”。再加上领导干部对工作抓的不紧，没有制订乘务员标准工作制度，奖罚不严明不及时，所以乘务员工作散漫，容易发生事故。针对上述缺点，在乘务员中进行了深入的教育，制订了十五条乘务员标准工作制度；并由该段段长、运转主任、司机指导等组成检查小组，不分昼夜，深入各站抽查。如该段长在廊坊故意将信号机落的不够度数，以考察乘务员对信号是否确认，并观察列车近站速度。司机指导于志淇在一八二○号开车前，将风泵关闭一个，以检查乘务员对机车的检查是否周密。由于加强了乘务员的责任心和警惕性，在安全运转月中乘务员们创造了许多模范事迹。如二月十五日，七二七号列车在天津机务段正在上水清炉时，火钩卡在炉条上，怎么也下不来了，偏巧接到命令，担任七二六次开回丰台。当时距发车时刻已近，为保证正点开车，司炉王琨冒高热钻入灰箱，用手锤把火钩打出，终于使列车正点开出。又如七五九七次列车在周口店调车时，机车注水器突然上不来水，那时琉璃河已没有机车，而丰台来车又赶不上，琉璃河车房水泵司机韩哲昌等闻讯，深夜赶往抢修，因而没有造成事故。
    为庆祝天津铁路局北京分局的成立，该段现又发动第二个二十万安全公里。现全段的机车组、行车员等正在积极制订各自的计划和提出保证条件，情绪极为高涨。（陈以福）
