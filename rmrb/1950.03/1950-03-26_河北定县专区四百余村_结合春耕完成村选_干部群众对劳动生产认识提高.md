Hebei Dingxian Special District Four Hundred Villages
Complete Village Elections in Conjunction with Spring Plowing
Cadres and Masses Increase Understanding of Labor Production

[Report from this newspaper] In Dingxian Special District, Hebei Province, democratic movements were carried out in conjunction with spring plowing. As of the 18th, according to statistics from ten counties including Dingxian and Anguo, 439 villages had elected village people's representative conferences and produced village people's governments. Seven districts have completed key demonstration district elections. Currently, with the exception of some disaster-stricken villages in Lixian and Raoyang, democratic movements have been universally launched in various counties. The characteristic of this movement is that it is closely integrated with spring plowing production, and production has become the practical content of building political power. The publicity for democratic political construction in counties such as Xingtang and Wuji clearly stated, "Democratic political construction is to better lead future production." In Wuji's Yao Village, voters originally only planted 160 mu of cotton. After understanding the policies through political construction publicity, the cotton fields increased to 212 mu. When voters in Anping and Xingtang discussed candidates, the first condition was active labor and the ability to lead the entire village in production. This has improved the thinking of cadres, party members, and the masses. Everyone believes that "labor is glorious" and "not laboring is shameful." In the newly elected People's Representative Conference of Xin'anzheng Village in Anping, the first thing they enthusiastically discussed was the village's production increase plan and the difficulty of having few draught animals (37 animals and over 1,000 mu of land needing spring plowing). Everyone agreed that only by inserting shares and mutual assistance, and exchanging manual labor for animal power, could spring plowing be completed, and they discussed mobilization and organization methods. Now, the 1,722 mu of land in the entire village has been harrowed once, laying the foundation for spring plowing and sowing. The voters said, "This election was a good one." However, in the combination of spring plowing and political construction in the entire region, some villages still have the following problems that urgently need to be solved: (1) The publicity for the democratic movement is not enough. Therefore, some cadres and party members believe that during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the land reform period, we were the ones who charged forward, and now we don't need it. Some believe that it is okay to elect the masses, but they are afraid that they will not be able to do the job. They don't believe in the power of the masses. Some masses believe that it is better to do less than more, and paying public grain is equivalent to being a "free king." Or they are afraid of delaying their own production. (2) Being too eager for quick results. Dujiazhuang Village in Shenze County completed the village election in three days. Village cadres tried to save trouble by designating village representatives to handle mass discussions and hastily passed the election. Zhang Village in Xinle County started voting before the masses were mobilized, and as a result, they did not succeed in electing even after two attempts. The Second District of Raoyang believes that there is a contradiction between political construction and spring plowing production, resulting in the bias of building political power first and producing later. (3) Not enough extensive mobilization of women to participate in the election. In some village elections, women asked men or parents to vote on their behalf. Some women are afraid that they will not be able to do the job if they are elected.

The main reason for the above biases is that the publicity and education are not thorough, and the cadres and masses have not yet realized the importance of democratic construction and its close relationship with production. To this end, on March 17, the Special Commissioner's Office Education Section held a special study and discussion at the Education Section Chiefs Conference of various counties, and issued instructions to widely carry out publicity for the democratic movement.

### 河北定县专区四百余村  结合春耕完成村选  干部群众对劳动生产认识提高

　　河北定县专区四百余村
    结合春耕完成村选
    干部群众对劳动生产认识提高
    【本报讯】河北定县专区春耕中结合开展了民主运动，至十八日，据定县、安国等十个县统计，四百三十九村均已选举出村人民代表会，并产生了村人民政府，七个区完成重点示范区选。目前，除蠡县、饶阳一部灾村外，各县均普遍展开民主运动。这一运动的特点是密切结合了春耕生产，生产变成建政的实际内容。行唐、无极等县民主建政的宣传，明确提出“民主建政是为了把今后的生产领导的更好。”无极姚村选民原仅种棉一百六十亩，经过建政宣传了解了政策后，棉田增加到二百一十二亩。安平、行唐选民讨论候选人，第一个条件就是积极劳动，能领导全村生产。这样即把干部、党员、群众思想提高了一步，大家都认为一劳动是光荣”、“不劳动是耻辱”。安平新正村在新选出的人民代表大会上，首先热烈讨论了全村增产计划与耕畜少的困难（三十七头牲口，一千余亩地需要春耕），大家一致认为只有插伙互助，人工换畜力才能完成春耕，并讨论了发动组织办法。现在全村一千七百二十二亩地普遍耙过一次，打下了春耕播种的基础，选民们说：“这回选举的好”。但在全区春耕结合建政中，仍有个别村存有以下急待解决的问题：（一）民主运动宣传做的不够，因此有的干部党员认为在抗日战争及土地改革时期，都是我们打冲锋，现在用不着了。有的认为选上群众也好，就怕他干不了。不相信群众力量。一些群众则认为多一事不如少一事，纳了公粮等于“自在王”。或怕耽误自己的生产。（二）急于求成，深泽县杜家庄三天就完成村选，村干部图省事，指定村代表包办群众讨论，草率通过。新乐县张村因群众没有发动起来就开始投票，结果选了两次也没有选成。饶阳二区认为建政与春耕生产有矛盾，产生先建政，后生产偏向。（三）广泛发动妇女参加选举做的不够，有的村选举时，妇女叫男人或家长给捎着投票。有的妇女怕选上自己干不了。
    发生以上偏向的主要原因，是宣传教育不深入，还没有使干部群众认识民主建设重要，与生产紧密结合的关系。为此，三月十七日专署教育科在各县教育科长会议上，专题作了研究讨论，并发出广泛开展民主运动宣传的指示。
