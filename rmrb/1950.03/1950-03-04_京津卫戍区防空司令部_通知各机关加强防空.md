　　Beijing-Tianjin Garrison Command Air Defense Headquarters
    Notifies All Agencies to Strengthen Air Defense
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to strengthen air defense, the Air Defense Headquarters of the Beijing-Tianjin Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army has issued a special notice. The notice first states: The U.S. and Chiang, enraged by the disastrous defeat of their war against the Chinese people, are attempting to retaliate against us with aircraft. Shanghai, Nanjing and other places have already been bombed. It is estimated that the range of enemy aircraft bombing may expand to other major cities. Therefore, all our agencies should pay serious attention, overcome complacency, and make air defense preparations in advance. The following specific items are stipulated:
    1. All leading agencies (especially air defense units, military agencies, etc.) should establish a 24-hour duty system, with dedicated personnel using dedicated air defense telephones to transmit air defense intelligence.
    2. Immediately repair air raid shelters and trenches. Do not be negligent or perfunctory.
    3. Pay attention to night-time light control and set up light shields.
    4. Improve the fire fighting organization.
    5. Organize and preserve archives, documents, seals, and important materials.
    6. Each warehouse agency should organize a guard team to prevent enemy sabotage.
    The notice also instructed the heads of all agencies to be responsible for checking the preparatory work, organizing and mobilizing all comrades to establish air defense organizations and conduct drills.
