　　Introduction to the Post-War German Workers' Movement
    Compiled by Cai Yingping
    After being liberated from the demonic rule of Hitler, the German working class, through five years of struggle, has become a powerful force in defending world peace and people's democracy, and is the main foundation of the German Democratic Republic under the leadership of President Pieck.
    Imperialists are most afraid of the unity of the world's working class. They try every means to attack and divide the progressive World Federation of Trade Unions. In West Germany, they try their best to split the German workers' movement, using various means to prevent the establishment of unified German trade unions, in order to maintain their exploitation and rule in West Germany.
    When Hitler fell, the German workers were very disorganized, and the trade union organizations were also very scattered. However, with the active help of the Soviet Union and the World Federation of Trade Unions, it achieved great development a year later, and the workers' awareness has been greatly improved.
    In the Soviet occupation zone of East Germany, after liberation, workers organized the "Free German Trade Union Federation," composed of the central organizations of eighteen industrial trade unions in the Soviet occupation zone and Greater Berlin. By the end of 1947, this federation had 4.5 million members. Under the leadership of the federation, the working class actively participated in political and production construction activities, assisted in eradicating the foundations of fascism and militarism, abolished the old system of capitalist monopoly and land property, and strived to achieve a unified organization of the working class within the country. Therefore, it repeatedly urged the restoration of trade union contacts between the occupation zones.
    With the help of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the trade unions in the occupation zones held their first joint meeting in mid-1946 to discuss the reconstruction and unification of German trade unions. After that, they met every three months, which had a great influence on the direction of the German labor movement, and made the relationship between the German labor movement and the World Federation of Trade Unions closer.
    This aroused great fear among the American and British reactionaries. On January 6, 1947, Green, the reactionary leader of the American Federation of Labor, demanded that the State Department take action to prevent German trade unions from participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions. Subsequently, the U.S. State Department issued a directive to General Clay, then in the U.S. occupation zone, ordering him to prohibit the federation of trade unions in the occupation zone from interfering with the organizational and financial independence of its member trade unions. This was clearly a measure to prevent the establishment of a unified trade union federation. In order to split the German workers' movement, the American Federation of Labor also specially set up a bureau in Germany to support the Social Democratic leader Schumacher and his lackeys in carrying out sabotage activities.
    These attempts were unsuccessful. The German workers still responded to the decisions and calls of the World Federation of Trade Unions' Council meeting in Prague in June 1947 to unite the national trade union organizations, participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions, and jointly fight against imperialism and fascist remnants.
    From October 21 to 23, 1947, the German trade unions held the sixth meeting between the occupation zones in Babimont, deciding to convene a national German trade union congress in the spring of 1948.
    In February 1948, the trade unions in the occupation zones held the seventh joint meeting in Dresden, mainly to discuss the issue of "convening a workers' congress." Various reactionary pressures followed. A spokesperson for the U.S. occupation zone military said: "Any German trade union that wants to join an international organization must obtain the consent of the occupation authorities." Some reactionary trade union representatives in the meeting tried their best to prevent the representatives from reaching any agreement, and tried to obstruct the discussion of establishing a unified trade union. Later, seeing that the situation was not good, most of the attending representatives demanded the establishment of a national unified trade union. They then suggested that each province send twenty representatives to the congress, instead of sending representatives according to the proportion of trade union members in each region. The reactionaries thought that if representatives were selected according to the proportion of trade union members, there would be 4.5 million members in the Soviet occupation zone, but only 3.5 million in the entire West Germany, which they obviously could not control. If the province is used as a unit, then West Germany has eleven provinces, each sending twenty people, a total of two hundred and twenty representatives. East Germany only has six provinces, and at most one hundred and forty representatives including the Greater Berlin region, so it is easier to control.
    The meeting finally refuted the traitor's suggestion, overcame other obstacles, and passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a national unified trade union central committee. This committee has the right to prepare for the convening of the All-German Workers' Congress.
    The American and British reactionaries, seeing that their German trade unionist lackeys could no longer continue to use deceptive cooperation to achieve their divisive goals, tore off their masks, and in August 1948, they banned the holding of inter-zone trade union meetings, and arbitrarily organized a so-called "Three-Zone Trade Union Federation" in the U.S., British, and French occupation zones. On the other hand, through their representatives in the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Kalai, Diggen, and Kubers, they obstructed the World Federation of Trade Unions from helping the German trade unions to unify.
    By the beginning of 1949, it was difficult for the trade unions in the German occupation zones to unify and organize. Although the workers in West Germany held strikes and demonstrations to oppose the division of the trade unions, the imperialist occupation authorities suppressed the workers, preventing them from further contacting the World Federation of Trade Unions and the world labor movement through a unified national trade union central organization.
    In view of this, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions met in February last year, amended the resolution of the Prague Conference in 1947, and decided to admit German trade unions as members zone by zone (referring to the occupation zones). This decision struck at the conspiracy of the British and American reactionaries to alienate the relationship between the German trade unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions, and strengthened the connection between the German workers and the workers of all countries.
    Soon, the "Free German Trade Union Federation" in the Soviet occupation zone officially became a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The "Free German Trade Union Federation" is organized according to industrial principles. After its establishment in 1945, it organized "factory councils" in factories and enterprises. In 1948, in order to adapt to the new situation and the requirements of developing production, it abolished this organization and replaced it with "factory trade union committees" to avoid the drawbacks of multiple leadership and work duplication.
    The "Free German Trade Union Federation" unites nearly five million members, regardless of the workers' political, religious, gender, or racial differences, actively participates in eradicating the remnants of fascism and militarism, participates in progressive social and economic reforms, restores the economy, improves workers' lives, and strives for the democratic unification of the motherland and world peace.
    Today, the working class and laboring people of East Germany have become the masters of various mines, factories, banks, insurance companies, and other large enterprises. The property of the big bourgeoisie and war criminals has been confiscated. Therefore, the workers' labor attitude and work enthusiasm are also very different. Production competitions are being launched everywhere, striving to complete and exceed the state's production plan.
    This production competition movement gained tremendous development in 1948, with thousands of workers being involved in this movement batch by batch. The workers of the famous Zeiss glass factory, Gresen heavy machinery factory, and Lila chemical factory, etc., all proposed guarantees to exceed the completion of the production plan. Workers from various factories challenged each other to promote the completion of the government's 1948 production plan. In the main industrial sectors, the plans were exceeded.
    Following the completion of the plan, the East German democratic government put forward a two-year plan to rebuild and develop the national economy of the Soviet occupation zone, and stipulated a plan to truly increase workers' wages in 1949-1950. This plan was universally and warmly supported by the workers. The trade union was the first to respond to the government's call, guaranteeing the completion of the plan, and it guaranteed this with active work.
    According to newspaper reports in January this year, in 1949, the laboring people of East Germany completed 104% of last year's production plan. Industrial production increased by 21% in one year. Compared with 1948, last year's production increased by 72% in the metallurgical industry, 41% in the machinery industry, 45% in the electrical equipment industry, 88% in the paper industry, and 23% in the precision instrument and optical instrument industry. The railway, highway, and waterway transportation plans were completed ahead of schedule. Food supply has been greatly improved, and prices have been reduced three times in one year. The volume of trade has increased fivefold. The public trade sector has developed smoothly. Real wages have increased.
    In production, the trade union actively supports the piece-rate wage system, and approves of the progressive bonus system for surplus production in major enterprises and factories. In this way, the workers' income will be in line with their labor contribution.
    In addition to promoting production, the Free German Trade Union Federation regularly carries out cultural and educational activities and technical learning among workers. Workers often watch dramas, listen to music, publish wall newspapers, and set up factory libraries, etc. The trade union also sends young trade union activists to study in university worker's special training classes, and all expenses are paid by the trade union.
    In addition, the trade union systematically trains its work cadres. Tens of thousands of cadres are trained in central trade union schools and local trade union schools. In addition to publishing a daily newspaper, a weekly newspaper, and a monthly magazine, the trade union also runs a special magazine for workers in public enterprises. The trade union runs these publications to enable workers and cadres to understand the theory, historical development, and changes in the status of the working class in the German workers' movement.
    At present, the East German workers' movement is not only combined with production and construction and healing war wounds, but also with the lofty tasks of striving for national unity, democracy, eradicating fascist remnants, and jointly defending world peace. Therefore, it firmly opposes the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, opposes the American and British imperialism turning West Germany into a springboard for the Third World War, and opposes the actions of imperialism and its lackeys in West Germany to split the German working class. With the cooperation and help of the working class all over the world, the German working class is able to complete its important tasks.

　　战后德国工人运动介绍
    蔡英平编译
    德国工人阶级从希特勒恶魔统治下解放出来以后，经过五年的斗争，已成为保卫世界和平与人民民主的一支强大的力量，也就是目前在皮克总统领导下的德意志民主共和国的主要基础。
    帝国主义者最害怕世界工人阶级的团结。他们想尽一切办法打击与分裂进步的世界工联，在西德，他们则极力分裂德国的工人运动，用各种手段阻止德国统一的工会成立，以维持他们在西德的剥削和统治。
    在希特勒倒台时，德国的工人很是涣散，工会组织也很散漫，但在苏联与世界工联的积极帮助下，一年后获得了巨大的发展，工人的觉悟性提高了不少。
    在东德苏军占领区里，解放之后，工人就组织了“自由德国工会联合会”；由苏占领区和大柏林的十八个产业工会的中央组织组成，这个联合会的会员在一九四七年底有四百五十万。在联合会领导之下，工人阶级积极参加了政治与生产建设活动，协助铲除法西斯与军国主义的基础，废除了资本家的垄断和土地财产的旧有制度，并努力求得国内工人阶级的统一组织。因此它三番五次促使恢复各占领区间的工会联系。
    在世界工联的帮助下，各占领区的工会在一九四六年中举行了第一次联席会议，讨论德国工会的重建与统一问题，之后，隔三个月集会一次，对德国工运的走向统一起了很大影响，而且使德国工运与世界工联之间的关系日趋密切。
    这样引起了美英反动派极大的恐惧。一九四七年一月六日，美国劳工联合会的反动头子格林，要求国务院采取行动，以阻止德国工会参加世界工联。随即，美国务院发一个指令给当时的美占领区克莱将军，要他下令不准占领区的工会联合会干涉所属会员工会的组织与财政的独立。这显然是阻止统一工会联合会成立的一种措施。为了分裂德国工人运动，美国劳工联合会更在德国特别设立了一个局，支持社会民主党的领袖舒马赫及其走狗们进行破坏活动。
    这些企图并没有成功。德国工人还是响应世界工联于一九四七年六月在布拉格召开的理事会的决定和号召，把全国的工会统一组织起来，参加世界工联，共同向帝国主义和法西斯残余斗争。
    一九四七年十月二十一至二十三日，德国工会在巴比蒙举行了第六次占领区间的会议，决定在一九四八年春召开全德工会代表大会。
    一九四八年二月，各占领区的工会，在德勒斯登召开了第七次联席会议，主要讨论“召开工人代表大会”的问题。各种反动的压力相继而来。美占领区军方发言人这样说：“任何德国工会要参加国际组织，必须获得占领当局的同意。”有些反动的工会代表在会议中竭力不让代表们达到任何协议，尽量阻挠讨论建立统一工会的问题。后来看看情势不妙，出席代表大多数都要求成立全国统一工会，他们便建议每省出二十个代表出席这个大会，而不是按各地区工会会员的比例来出代表。反动派在想，若按照工会会员比例选代表，在苏占区有四百五十万会员，在整个西德却只有三百五十万，他们显然控制不了。倘若按照省作单位，那么西德有十一省，每省出二十人，共可有二百二十个代表，东德却只有六省，连大柏林区在内，最多只能出一百四十个代表，那么比较容易控制。
    会议终于驳斥了工贼的建议，并克服了其他障碍，通过决议，号召成立全国统一的工会中央委员会。这委员会有权准备全德工人代表大会的召开。
    美英反动派眼看到他们在德国的工贼走狗再没有办法继续用欺骗性的合作姿态以达其分裂的目的，于是扯破假面具，在一九四八年八月禁止区间工会会议的召开，并擅自在美英法占领区中组织了一个所谓“三区工会联合会”。另外一方面，他们经过在世界工联执行局中的代表卡莱、狄根、和库柏尔斯，阻挠世界工联帮助德国工会统一的活动。
    到一九四九年初，德国各占领区的工会已难于统一组织，虽然西德工人举行罢工示威以反对工会的分裂状态，但帝国主义占领当局镇压工人，不让工人经过统一全国的工会中央组织更进一步和世界工联与世界工运联系。
    有鉴于此，世界工联执行委员会在去年二月开会，修改了一九四七年布拉格会议的决议，决定一区一区（指占领区）地吸收德国工会作会员。这个决定，打击了英美反动派企图离间德国工会与世界工联关系的阴谋，并加强了德国工人和各国工人间的联系。
    不久，苏占领区里的“自由德国工会联合会”便正式成为世界工联的一员了。
    “自由德国工会联合会”是按照产业原则组织起来的，在一九四五年成立以后，它在工厂企业里组织“工厂理事会”，在一九四八年为了适应新的情况与发展生产的要求，便取消了这种组织，代之以“工厂工会委员会”，以避免多头领导与工作重复的弊病。
    “自由德国工联”不问工人在政治、宗教、性别、种族上的区别，团结了近五百万会员，积极参加铲除法西斯和军国主义的残余，参加进步的社会改革与经济改革，恢复经济，改善工人生活，并为祖国的民主统一与世界和平而奋斗。
    今天，东德的工人阶级和劳动人民已成为各矿区、工厂、银行、保险公司及其他大企业的主人。大资产阶级和战争罪犯的财产已被没收。因此，工人们的劳动态度和工作热情也大大不同了。各地都展开了生产竞赛，为了完成并超过国家的生产计划而努力。
    这个生产竞赛运动在一九四八年间获得巨大的发展，成千成万的工人一批一批地卷进这个运动。著名的蔡司玻璃工厂，格瑞生重机械厂，利拉化学工厂等的工人，都提出超过完成生产计划的保证。各厂工人相互挑战，推动完成政府的一九四八年生产计划。在主要的工业部门中，都超过完成计划。
    紧随着计划的完成，东德民主政权提出了一个重建与发展苏占区的国民经济的两年计划，并规定在一九四九——一九五○年中真正提高工人工资的计划。这个计划普遍地受到工人们热烈的拥护。工会首先响应政府的号召，保证计划的完成，它以积极的工作保证了这一点。
    据今年一月份报纸的报导，在一九四九年中，东德劳动人民已完成去年生产计划百分之一○四。工业生产在一年中上升了百分之二十一。和一九四八年比较，去年的生产在冶金业中增加了百分之七十二，机器业百分之四十一，电工器材业百分之四十五，制纸业百分之八十八，精确仪器和光学仪器业百分之二十三。铁路、公路及水路运输计划都提早完成。食物供应大为改善，一年中，物价减低三次。贸易量增加五倍。公营贸易部门顺利发展。实际工资增加了。
    在生产中，工会积极拥护计件工资的制度，并赞成在主要企业和工厂中，对于超额的生产采取累进的奖金制。这样，会使得工人的收入与他们的劳动贡献相符合。
    自由德国工联除了推动生产外，经常地在工人中展开文化教育活动与技术学习。工人们时常看戏、听音乐、出版墙报，并设立工厂图书馆等。工会并保送年青的工会活动分子到大学工人专修班去学习，费用一概由工会支付。
    除此之外，工会又有计划有步骤地训练其工作干部。成千近万个干部，在中央职工学校与地方职工学校中受训练。工会除了出版一份日报，一份周刊与一份月刊之外，且特为公营企业工人办一份杂志。工会办这些刊物，使工人与干部们了解德国工人运动的理论，历史发展，和工人阶级地位的变化。
    目前东德工人运动不仅和生产建设、医治战争创伤结合起来，而且更和争取全国统一、民主、肃清法西斯残余、共同保卫世界和平的崇高任务相结合。因此它坚决反对侵略性的北大西洋公约，反对美英帝国主义把西德变为第三次世界大战的跳板，反对帝国主义及其在西德的走狗分裂德国工人阶级的行动。在全世界工人阶级的配合与帮助下，德国工人阶级是能够完成它的重大任务的。
