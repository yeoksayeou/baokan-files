Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd—The "New York Times," mouthpiece of Wall Street financial magnates in the United States, published an article on the 4th of this month encouraging the Kuomintang remnant bandits to carry out air and sea harassment against our country. The newspaper said: "Although this method (referring to the remnant bandits' air and sea harassment) has some shortcomings, its effect on destroying the CCP's economy is beyond the expectations of ordinary people. 'President' Chiang has effectively exerted the power of his naval and air forces." According to a dispatch from the bandit Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 19th, MacArthur is also "closely watching" the activities of the Kuomintang remnant bandits harassing the Chinese coast.

　　美帝鼓励残匪骚扰我国海空
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国华尔街财阀的喉舌《纽约时报》于本月四日著文鼓励国民党残匪对我国进行海空骚扰。该报说：“这种方法（按指残匪的海空骚扰）虽有若干缺点，惟其破坏中共经济的效果，则出乎一般人士预料之外。蒋‘总统’已使他麾下的海空军有效地发挥它们的威力。”另据匪中央社东京十九日电透露：麦克阿瑟也正在“密切注视”国民党残匪骚扰中国沿海的活动。
