Paying Attention to Technology and Working Hard on Research
Sujiatun Sandpaper Quality Improved
[By Our Newspaper] The Shenyang Sujiatun Abrasives Factory, through the diligent research and improvement of operational techniques by its technicians, has significantly improved the quality of its sandpaper. Since the factory started production in March of last year, the quality of sandpaper has been consistently poor; it would stick together when exposed to moisture and exhibited a tendency to shed grit. After sandpaper from Shanghai was sold to various parts of Northeast China last December, the factory's products became unsellable. Under this objective stimulus, the factory began to emphasize technological improvement. In addition to suspending production in the sandpaper department, a research group composed of engineers, technicians, and experienced veteran workers was formed to diligently study the problem. Through the combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience, new operating methods have been obtained in one month, through twelve consecutive tests. The product quality has been significantly improved, creating a new level of abrasive technology.

　　重视技术努力钻研
    苏家屯砂纸质量提高
    【本报讯】沈阳苏家屯砂轮厂经技工努力研究，改进操作技术，砂纸质量已显著提高。该厂自去年三月开工以来，砂纸质量一贯不佳，一经潮湿就粘到一起，且有掉砂现象。去年十二月间上海砂纸销到东北各地后，该厂之产品即无法销售。在这种客观刺激之下，该厂开始重视技术改进，除停止了砂纸部的生产外，并由工程师、技术员和有经验的老工人等组成研究组，苦心钻研。由于理论知识和实际经验相结合，在一个来月中，经十二次连续试验，已经获得了新的操作方法，产品质量已显著提高，创造了新的砂轮技术水平。
