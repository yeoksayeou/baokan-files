　　Elected Model for the Third Time
    ——On Comrade Liu Zhou, Special-Class Model Cook of North China People's Revolutionary University
    Comrade Liu Zhou is from Lingqiu County, Shanxi Province, forty-eight years old this year, and of tenant farmer origin. Since joining the revolutionary work in March 1946, this is the third time he has been elected as a model worker. Due to Comrade Liu's consistent loyalty and honesty, hard work, unity and friendship towards comrades, and excellent work style of striving for simplification and frugality in work, he was first elected as a model in the Ping Shan Party School in September 1948, and a second time in the Tianjin Branch of the Revolutionary University in July 1949.

    Comrade Liu gets up the earliest every day and goes to bed the latest; he is always paying attention to the work in the kitchen, with a high sense of responsibility and proactive creativity. He often carefully studies how to leaven dough and has never once steamed a bad bun; his coal burning technique has been studied especially well. The entire kitchen serves around four hundred and fifty to six hundred people, averaging about four hundred pounds of coal burned per day, less than one pound per person; in kitchens serving roughly the same number of people, some burn eight or nine hundred pounds per day, and others six or seven hundred pounds. Comparing this, by burning two hundred pounds less than other kitchens per day, six thousand pounds could be saved each month, saving the people such a large amount of expense. Comrade Liu has put a lot of thought and research into this contribution. Originally, each stove had six grate bars, but he thought they were too sparse, so he added another one to reduce coal leakage; he doesn’t stoke the fire randomly, but when fire is needed, he uses the fire hook to gather the surrounding coal towards the middle, and the fire blazes vigorously; at the same time, the fire is never idle, always used to make something, such as boiling water. Once the water boils, he immediately transfers it to the back pot, and then boils the second pot of water; the method of adding coal is also very precise: only put it on the mouth of the stove, and the wind draws it in, the fire attacking the bottom of the pot perfectly. In short, Comrade Liu often considers how to improve the stove. Recently, he raised the grate bars farther from the pot and reduced the size of the firebox, so that the firepower is even greater and coal is saved even more.

    In addition to saving coal, Comrade Liu is also very prominent in saving other materials. He can carefully grasp the number of people eating, study the eating patterns, accurately measure and weigh, and put in the right amount of rice and flour according to the number of people, without any waste. He is also very responsible in caring for public property, washing and tidying up all kinds of furniture regularly, and repairing them automatically at any time, such as wooden troughs, water storage pool pipes, rice washing pools, stoves... none of which were not repaired by himself or with his participation. Comrade Liu humbly accepts other people's opinions and also responsibly criticizes others. When he first arrived at the kitchen last year, there was disunity among the comrades. Through his help and the influence of his personal example, the kitchen has now achieved unity. He has a correct work attitude and political stance, recognizing that this is serving the people and not working for money. He said, "Working well is serving the people well. Wherever the work needs me, I will go. Everything must be worthy of the people!" When his apron was damaged, he did not ask the public to provide a new one, but used the money he had saved to make a new one, fully demonstrating the spirit of a revolutionary worker who does not care about personal gains or losses.

    In short, Comrade Liu Zhou is praised by the comrades in labor, economy, hygiene, and unity. Comrade Xiao Gao, a cook in the kitchen, said: "He is really qualified to be a model, he does a really good job, not just pretending. He has the spirit of bearing hardships and standing hard work, he is better than everyone else!" The administrator said: "He works steadily, not only is he personally active, but he can also motivate everyone!"

　　第三次当选模范
    ——记华北人民革命大学特等模范炊事员刘洲同志
    刘洲同志是山西陵邱县人，今年四十八岁，雇农出身；自一九四六年三月参加革命工作以来，这次已是第三次当选为模范了。由于刘同志一贯的忠诚老实、吃苦耐劳，对同志团结友爱，对工作力求精简节约的优良作风，一九四八年九月第一次在平山党校被选为模范，一九四九年七月第二次在革大天津分校被选为模范。
    刘同志每天起的最早，睡的最晚；时时刻刻都在注意着厨房里的工作，有着高度的责任心和积极的创造性。他经常细心研究发面从来没有蒸坏过一次馒头；烧煤技术更研究得特好。全灶一共四百五、六十个人吃饭，平均每天约烧四百斤左右，每人平均不到一斤；在人数大约相同的灶里，多者每天烧八、九百斤，少者六、七百斤，这样一比较，按每天比旁的灶少烧二百斤来说，每月就该少烧六千斤，为人民节省了这么大的一笔开支。在这一贡献上，刘同志是费了很多思索和研究的，原来每个灶是六根炉条，他看见太稀了，于是再加上一根，使其少漏煤；不随便乱通火，到用火时将火钩把四周围的煤向当中一收，火就熊熊的旺盛起来了；同时火总是没有闲着的时候，都是利用来作了东西的，如烧开水，水一开，马上就掏到后锅，接着又烧第二锅开水；添煤的方法也很精细：只放在灶的口子上，风力往里抽，火恰好攻在锅底。总之，刘同志经常考虑着如何改进炉灶的问题，最近他又把离锅较远的炉条抬高了一些，炉膛也缩小了一些，这样火力就更加大了，烧煤也更省了。
    刘同志除省煤外，在节省其他物资上也是很突出的，他能细心掌握吃饭人数，研究吃饭规律，确实过斗过秤，按人数下米发面，没有过浪费的现象。在爱护公物上也是非常尽责的，把各种家具经常洗刷收拾得好好的，随时自动的修理，如木槽、蓄水池的管子、淘米水池子、炉灶…，无一样不是他自己动手或参加修理好的。刘同志虚心接受别人意见，也负责的批评别人。他去年刚到该灶时，同志之间闹不团结，经过他的帮助和以身作则的影响，现在该灶已达到团结了。他有着正确的工作态度和政治立场，认识了这是为人民服务而不是为钱而工作，他说：“好好的工作就是好好的为人民服务。工作需要我到那里就到那里，凡事要对得住老百姓啦！”围裙坏了，不向公家要，把自己节省下来的钱作来穿，充分表现了革命工作者不计较个人利害的精神。
    总之，无论在劳动、节约、卫生、团结上，刘洲同志都受到同志们的赞扬，该灶炊事员小高同志说：“他确实够当模范，工作真好，一点不虚，有吃苦耐劳的精神，什么都数他强！”管理员同志说：“他工作踏实，不但个人积极，还能带动大家！”
