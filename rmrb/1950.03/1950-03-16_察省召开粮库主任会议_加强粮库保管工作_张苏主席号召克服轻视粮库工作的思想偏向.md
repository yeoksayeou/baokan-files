The Chahar Province Holds Grain Depot Directors' Conference
    Strengthen Grain Depot Storage Work
    Chairman Zhang Su Calls for Overcoming Ideological Tendencies of Underestimating Grain Depot Work
    [This newspaper reports] (By our reporter Lin Hong): In order to strengthen grain storage work, the Chahar Provincial Grain Bureau specially convened a provincial grain depot directors' conference from March 6th to 12th. More than 110 people attended the meeting, including the directors of district depots, central branch depots, and branch depots. During the meeting, Provincial Chairman Zhang Su attended and delivered a speech. He pointed out some ideological problems existing among grain depot cadres today: such as feeling that grain work has no "future," that the status of grain depot cadres is low, and that the responsibilities they bear are great, making them prone to punishment, etc., which are all extremely incorrect understandings. He asked everyone to overcome the idea of underestimating grain work, strictly adhere to the system, and strive to store grain well; to fight against the guerrilla habits existing in some areas and the chaotic phenomenon of grabbing public grain haphazardly. He emphasized that doing a good job in grain storage is completing a very important political task. After seven days of reports and discussions, the representatives at the meeting ideologically recognized that grain work is an important part of the national financial work, and the central link of grain work is storage work; that today, it is not yet possible to universally establish modern new-style warehouses, and to store grain well, we must mainly rely on the active efforts of grain depot cadres at all levels and think of more methods. Based on this spirit, the meeting made the following decisions to strengthen grain storage work: First, grain depot cadres at all levels should clearly establish the view of cherishing state property and resolutely completing the task of grain storage; Second, combine regular inspections of accounts and cleaning of warehouses to conduct ideological inspections and launch a struggle against corruption and waste, in order to establish a style of hard work and integrity; Third, grain depots at all levels should strictly adhere to the system and implement the provisions of the State Council's unified national financial and economic instructions regarding the Ministry of Finance's unified allocation and use of public grain. In the future, without the allocation order of the superior grain depot, no individual or organization may privately use public grain; Fourth, establish a regular inspection and reporting system, study relevant grain storage techniques and methods, and should also grasp and understand the nature of various grains, pay attention to seasonality, and conduct timely inspections or turning and drying of grains to prevent grains from becoming insect-infested or rotten; Fifth, establish a grain storage committee, do a good job in the relationship with the masses in the villages where the grain depots are located, so that grain storage work becomes a mass work, and should be vigilant, strengthen night defense, so that grain theft incidents do not occur. In addition, clear provisions were made regarding strengthening the ideological and political education of cadres, and that grain depots above the central branch depot should accept the dual leadership of the superior grain depot and the government at the same level.

　　察省召开粮库主任会议
    加强粮库保管工作
    张苏主席号召克服轻视粮库工作的思想偏向
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：为加强粮食保管工作，察哈尔省粮食局特于三月六日至十二日召开全省粮库主任会议。出席会议者有各区库、中心分库及分库的库主任等共约一百一十余人。会议进行中，省府张苏主席曾出席讲话，他指出今天粮库干部中间存在的一些思想问题：如觉得粮食工作没有“前途”，粮库干部的地位低，而担负的责任又很大，容易受处分等，都是极不正确的认识。他要求大家克服轻视粮食工作的思想，应严格坚持制度，努力把粮食保管好；与某些地区存在的游击习气及对公粮乱抓一把的紊乱现象作斗争。并着重说明，作好粮食保管工作，就是完成了一件很重要的政治任务。会议经过七天的报告与讨论，与会代表在思想上已经认识到：粮食工作是全国财政工作的一个重要部分，而粮食工作的中心环节则是保管工作；在今天普遍建立近代化的新式库房还不可能，要把粮食保管好，主要依靠各级粮库干部积极努力，多想办法。会议根据这一精神，对于加强粮食保管工作作了如下的决定：第一、各级粮库干部应明确树立爱护国家财产，坚决完成粮食保管任务的观点；第二结合定期的检查账目及清理仓库，进行思想检查，展开反贪污浪费斗争，以树立艰苦廉洁的作风；第三各级粮库应严格坚持制度，贯彻政务院颁布的统一国家财政经济指示中关于财政部统一调配使用公粮的规定，今后凡没有上级粮库的拨付命令，任何人或任何机关不得私自动用公粮；第四建立经常的检查报告制度，学习有关粮食保管的技术与方法，并应掌握了解各种粮食的性质，注意季节性，作到及时检查或倒仓翻晒，使粮食不致生虫或腐烂；第五建立粮食保管委员会，搞好粮库所在村的群众关系，使粮食保管工作成为群众性的工作，并应提高警惕，夜间勤加防守，使粮食偷盗事件不致发生。此外对于加强干部的思想政治教育，及中心分库以上的粮库应接受上级粮库和同级政府的双重领导等，均作了明确的规定。
