　　Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on
    Disciplining Comrades Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng
    Comrades Gao Zhaoqing and Cui Daosheng are formal party members and currently serve as deputy directors of the No. 2 Electrical Machinery Repair Factory of the Telecommunications Bureau. The factory experienced continuous theft incidents at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Comrades Gao and Cui did not pay attention to the clues provided by the masses. Cui Daosheng even conducted private inspections of the factory's dormitory. Gao Zhaoqing even prevented worker Dai Pinzhen from leaving the factory, causing great dissatisfaction among the workers. Such behavior, restricting personal freedom and violating the policies of the government and the Party, is absolutely intolerable by Party discipline. Considering that Comrades Gao and Cui have already conducted profound self-criticism in the Party member meeting and mass meeting, admitted their mistakes, and sincerely requested correction, they are hereby given a public warning as a disciplinary action.
    Their mistakes and the disciplinary action will be published in the newspaper to educate party members.

　　中国共产党北京市委员会关于
    处分高兆庆崔道生二同志的决定
    高兆庆、崔道生二同志，系正式党员，现任电信总局第二电机修配厂副厂长，该厂于去年底及今年初连续发生偷盗事件，高、崔二同志对群众提供线索，不加重视，崔道生竟私自进行厂内宿舍检查，高兆庆竟不准工友戴聘珍出厂，引起工人群众极大不满。此种限制人身自由、违反政府和党的政策的行为，是党纪所绝不容许的。兹念高、崔二同志已在党员大会和群众大会迅速进行了深刻的反省承认了自己的错误，并诚恳要求改正，特给予当众警告的处分。
    并将其错误和处分在报纸公布，以教育党员。
