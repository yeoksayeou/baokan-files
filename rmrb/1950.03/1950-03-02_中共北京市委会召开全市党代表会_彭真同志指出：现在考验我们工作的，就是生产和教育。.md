The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Holds City-Wide Party Representative Conference
	Comrade Peng Zhen Points Out: Production and Education Are Now the Test of Our Work.
	[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a city-wide Party Representative Conference around the Spring Festival to review the work of 1949 and discuss the guidelines and tasks for 1950. The conference opened on February 14th.
	After five meetings and two group discussions, it concluded on the afternoon of the 21st. Three hundred and thirty-four representatives attended, including Party member representatives from various agencies, factories, schools, Party committees, and branches in Beijing. The venue was filled with charts and graphs showcasing Beijing's production and construction achievements over the past year and the targets for the 1950 production and construction plan, fully demonstrating the achievements and direction of the work of the entire Party and the people of Beijing. From these charts, one can see that the great people's capital is advancing towards the path of production and construction.
	After the opening of the conference on the 14th, Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, first reported on the work of the past year and the central tasks for this year. He made a detailed and profound summary and review of the achievements and shortcomings of various aspects of work in the past year. On the issue of work style, Comrade Peng Zhen specifically pointed out to Party workers: it is necessary to humbly and cautiously unite and cooperate with non-Party members and serve the people diligently. It is necessary to closely connect Party members with the people, strictly prevent the emergence and infection of bureaucratic work styles, and not turn work units into yamen detached from the masses. Regarding the central tasks for this year, Comrade Peng Zhen repeatedly emphasized that "production is our overriding central task for 1950," and how Party members and members of the Communist Youth League should work together with workers and all citizens to strive for the completion of this central task. After analyzing the situation of the recovery and development of production in Beijing since its liberation a year ago, he pointed out that the central task for this year is to follow the development direction of last year and make production grow by an inch, two inches, and as much as possible. He proposed that this year's tasks are: to put great effort into doing a good job in state-owned production; to manage factories with scientific and precise calculations; to formulate production plans; to implement democratic management; to establish collective contracts; and to launch the New Record Movement; wages should be paid according to work, and bonuses should be given for exceeding quotas. For private enterprises: first, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over the production direction and technological improvement of private enterprises; second, it is necessary to strengthen support for industries that are beneficial to the people; third, conditions permitting, production competitions should be launched in private factories. He pointed out that the conditions for launching production competitions in private enterprises are, first, industries that are beneficial to the people; second, workers must participate in factory management, and at the same time, collective contracts must be signed, and wages must be paid according to work, with increasing rewards for exceeding quotas. Comrade Peng Zhen called on agencies and schools to launch production movements, improve livelihoods through production, and organize the production of cadres' families to solve the living difficulties of cadres' families. At the end of his report, he repeatedly emphasized: "We have talked a lot about production, but it doesn't matter if we talk a lot. We should talk about it ten thousand times, and if ten thousand times is not enough, we should talk about it ten thousand and one times. Supporting the war relies on production, improving the people's lives relies on production. All our work in Beijing should be centered on production, and should be carried out around production. Production is our overriding central task for 1950!"
	On the 15th, Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary and Director of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee, reported on the work and tasks of the Party, and made detailed reviews on issues such as Party development, Party member education, cadre work, Party-mass relations, and the division of labor between Party and government. He determined that this year's central task of the Party is to ensure that all aspects of work are done well, especially production. He called on Party members to learn technology and factory management in their production posts.
	After group discussions by the representatives and two consecutive plenary speeches, the representatives, based on the spirit of this report, conducted heated criticism and self-criticism on work, systems, and work styles, and expressed unanimous approval of the two reports. On the 21st, Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, made a summary of the conference. After summarizing the opinions of the representatives and answering questions from various aspects, he especially called on Party cadres to improve their culture, learn professional skills, study economics, learn technology, and factory management. He finally pointed out that the Party must use various forms to conduct criticism and self-criticism regularly and continuously. In the past, during the war, what tested us was the work of expanding the army, public grain, war support, disaster relief, and so on. Now, the form of testing us is different. What tests our work now is production and education. It is necessary to use various forms such as Party openness, Party representative meetings, people's representative meetings, and mass representative meetings to review work, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and continuously improve the work of the Party.

　　中共北京市委会召开全市党代表会
    彭真同志指出：现在考验我们工作的，就是生产和教育。
    【北京讯】中国共产党北京市委员会在春节前后召开了全市党的代表会议，检讨一九四九年的工作，讨论一九五○年的方针和任务。会议于二月十四日开幕。
    经五次会议和两次小组讨论，于二十一日下午闭幕。出席代表三三四人，包括北京市各机关、工厂、学校、党委和支部的党员代表。会场四周满挂北京市一年来生产建设的图表和一九五○年生产建设计划的指标，充分显示全党和全北京市人民工作的成就与努力的方向；从这些图表，可以看出伟大的人民首都正在向生产建设的大道迈进。
    十四日会议开幕之后，首先由市委书记彭真同志报告一年来的工作和今年的中心任务。他对过去一年各方面工作的成绩和缺点，作了详尽深刻的总结和检讨。在工作的作风问题上，彭真同志特别向党的工作人员提出：要谦虚谨慎的和党外人士团结合作，为人民当勤务员。要密切党员与人民的联系，严防官僚主义作风的产生和习染，不要把工作机关变成脱离群众的衙门。关于今年的中心任务，彭真同志反复强调说明，“生产就是我们一九五○年压倒一切的中心任务”，如何进一步来恢复发展北京的生产，及党员团员如何和工人与全体市民一齐为着这个中心任务的完成而努力。他分析了北京解放一年来在生产上恢复与发展的情况之后，指出今年的中心任务，是按照去年的发展方向，使生产长一寸、长两寸，长得愈多愈好。他提出今年的任务是：要用很大的力量把公营生产搞好，管理工厂要有科学的精密计算，要制订生产计划，要实行民主管理，要订立集体合同，要开展新纪录运动；工资应按劳取值，超额给奖。对私营企业：第一、要增强对私营企业的生产方向和技术改进的领导；第二、要加强扶植对人民有利的工业；第三、有条件的发动私营工厂的生产竞赛。他指出在私营企业发动生产竞赛的条件，首先是对人民有利的工业；其次是工人必须参加工厂的管理，同时必须订立集体合同，实行工资的按劳取值，超额报酬递增。彭真同志号召机关和学校展开生产运动，从生产中来改善生活，并组织干部家属生产来解决干部家属的生活困难。他在报告结束时，反复强调：“生产这句话讲的很多了，讲得多不要紧，应该讲一万次，一万次不够就该讲一万零一次。支援战争靠生产，改善人民生活靠生产，我们北京市的一切工作，要以生产为中心，要围绕着生产来进行，生产就是我们一九五○年压倒一切的中心任务！”
    十五日会议由市委副书记兼组织部长刘仁报告党的工作和任务，对党的发展、党员教育、干部工作、党群关系、党政分工等问题都作了详尽的检讨，确定今年党的中心工作是保证把各方面工作搞好，特别是把生产搞好。他号召党员们在生产岗位上学习技术，学习工厂管理。
    经过代表们的分组讨论和一连两次大会的发言，代表们根据这个报告的精神，在工作上、制度上、作风上进行了热烈的批评与自我批评，并对这两个报告表示一致的赞同。二十一日由市委书记彭真同志作会议总结，他总结了代表们的意见并解答了各方面的问题之后，特别号召党的干部提高文化、学习业务，学习经济，学习技术和工厂管理。他最后指出：党必须利用各种形式经常不断地进行批评与自我批评。在过去战争期间，考验我们的是扩军、公粮、战勤、救灾等等工作，而现在考验我们的形式是不同了，现在来考验我们的工作的，就是生产和教育。要利用党的公开，党的代表会议，人民代表会议，群众代表会议等各种形式来检讨工作进行批评与自我批评，来不断改进党的工作。
