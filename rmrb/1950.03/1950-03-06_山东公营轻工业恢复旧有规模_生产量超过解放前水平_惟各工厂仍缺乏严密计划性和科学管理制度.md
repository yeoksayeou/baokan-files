　　Shandong Publicly Owned Light Industry Restores Old Scale; Production Exceeds Pre-Liberation Levels, But Factories Still Lack Strict Planning and Scientific Management Systems

　　[This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency: Shandong Province's publicly owned light industry has now restored its old production scale and has increased production beyond pre-liberation levels. In the textile industry, Qingdao China Textile factories have increased production by about 25% compared to pre-liberation levels, while Jinan Chengda, Renfeng, and other yarn factories have more than doubled production. The flour industry has increased production by more than 50%; the paper industry has more than doubled production; in the rubber industry, automobile tire production has more than doubled; and mechanical belts and rubber hoses have increased tenfold. The production of the chemical industry and matches has also increased compared to pre-liberation levels.

　　Shandong Province's main publicly owned light industry factories are distributed in the cities of Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Zhoucun, including eighteen factories under trusteeship and two joint public-private enterprises, totaling more than sixty, including textiles, flour, vegetable oil, matches, paper, rubber, pigments, pharmaceuticals, soap, clothing, and ice-making factories.

　　Qingdao City is the main base of Shandong's publicly owned light industry. The Qingdao China Textile Company's spindles account for about 80% of the total number of publicly owned yarn factory spindles in Shandong Province. The Qingdao Rubber Company's equipment scale also occupies an important position in the national rubber industry. Qingdao City was liberated in June of last year. Because the People's Government clearly made restoring production the center of all work at that time, and promptly solved the difficulties of lacking industrial raw materials and fuel, all factories fully resumed work in less than ten days after the city's liberation. Afterwards, through clearing materials, organizing and educating workers, launching production and conservation campaigns, and other work, the production landscape was renewed, and the enthusiasm of the working class was greatly enhanced. According to statistics, within eight months after the city's liberation, workers and technicians in the light industry and municipal enterprises proposed more than 170 relatively important creations and improvements, which became important factors for increasing production and reducing costs in various factories. For example, the output of 12-pound cloth per machine per ten hours in the weaving department of the China Textile Yarn Factory increased from 28 yards in June of last year to the current 40 yards, breaking the highest record in three years. At the same time, the rate of secondary cloth decreased from 10% to below 5%. A particularly significant improvement is that the supply of domestic cotton has accounted for more than 60% of China Textile's total cotton consumption, whereas before liberation, more than 77% of the cotton used depended on foreign cotton. Workers at the Qilu Vegetable Oil Factory also modified six oil presses, increasing the daily oil production of each machine by one time.

　　The publicly owned light industry factories in Jinan and Xuzhou, which were liberated successively in the autumn and winter of the year before last, initially saw a significant increase in production when they resumed work because the workers were relatively active in production. However, later, due to the existence of closed-doorism and one-sided welfare viewpoints in trade union work, as well as the tendency of extreme democratization in administrative management, there was a period of relaxed labor discipline and reduced production efficiency. The yarn production of Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory decreased from 1,320 pieces in March of last year to 820 pieces in July. In September of last year, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions conveyed the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' resolution to "organize the working class within one year." The Provincial People's Government's Production Department also convened a provincial conference on publicly owned light industry, which criticized the administrative leadership and trade union organizations of various factories for failing to cooperate well and centering their work on developing production. It also proposed and implemented work such as streamlining and economizing, setting operating standards and work standards, and gradually establishing an economic accounting system. At the same time, trade union work cadres also earnestly overcame the tendency of closed-doorism, successively absorbing 80% of workers into trade union organizations, and relying on them to carry out material inventory work in various factories, establishing a detailed inventory system for raw materials, establishing factory management committees, re-establishing labor discipline and reward and punishment systems, and some factories even adopted a piece-rate bonus wage system. After these improvements, production work began to get on the right track. The daily yarn production of Jinan Chengda Yarn Factory increased from 26 pieces in September of last year to 30 pieces. Jinan Flour Factory's hourly flour production in October of last year increased by 35% compared to September. Xuzhou Oil Factory's oil production from October to December of last year also increased from 12 slots to 14 slots.

　　The current problems in the production of Shandong's publicly owned light industry factories are the lack of strict planning, the lack of scientific management systems in the receipt, dispatch, and storage of raw materials, resulting in serious waste and high costs. At the same time, the established factory management committees are largely a formality. The factory director conferences of various industries convened by the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Production Department in February have conducted inspections on the above-mentioned problems and are preparing to improve business management in a planned way.

　　山东公营轻工业恢复旧有规模
    生产量超过解放前水平
    惟各工厂仍缺乏严密计划性和科学管理制度
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：山东省公营轻工业现已恢复了旧有的生产规模，并使生产量超过了解放前的水平。纺织业方面，青岛中纺各厂比较解放前约增产百分之二十五，济南成大、仁丰等纱厂则增产一倍以上；面粉业增产百分之五十多；造纸业增产一倍以上；橡胶业方面汽车胎增产一倍多；机械带、胶管增产十倍；化学工业和火柴的产量也比解放前提高了。
    山东省公营轻工业的主要工厂，分布于青岛、济南、徐州、周村诸市，包括代管的十八个厂和公私合营的两个厂，共有六十多个，其中包括纺织、面粉、植物油、火柴、造纸和橡胶、颜料、制药、肥皂、被服、制冰等厂。
    山东公营轻工业的主要基点是青岛市。青岛中纺公司所有纱锭约占山东全省公营纱厂纱锭总数的百分之八十。青岛橡胶公司的设备规模在全国橡胶工业中亦占着重要地位。青岛市系于去年六月解放，由于当时人民政府明确以恢复生产为一切工作的中心，并及时解决了工业原料和燃料缺乏的困难。所以全市解放不到十天，工厂便全部复工。以后经过清理物资，组织教育工人，开展生产节约运动等工作，使生产面貌一新，工人阶级的积极性也大为提高。据统计，该市解放后八个月内轻工业和市政企业方面由工人和技师们提出的较为重要的创造和改进，即有一百七十多件，成为各厂增加产量、减低成本的重要因素。如中纺纱厂织布部十二磅布每台十小时的产量即由去年六月份的二十八码增至目前的四十码，打破了三年来的最高纪录。同时次布率由百分之十降至百分之五以下。尤其有意义的改进是国产棉的供应已占到中纺全部用棉量的百分之六十以上。而在解放前所用棉花百分之七十七以上是依赖外棉。齐鲁植物油厂工人也改制了六部榨油机，使每部机的每日产油量提高一倍。
    前年秋冬间相继解放的济南、徐州的公营轻工业各厂，在解放初期因工人生产比较积极，复工时产量均有显著增加；但以后曾因工会工作上存在着关门主义和片面的福利观点以及行政管理有极端民主化的偏向，以致有一时期中发生劳动纪律松懈、生产效率降低的现象。济南仁丰纱厂的产纱量即由去年三月份的一千三百二十件降为七月份的八百二十件。去年九月山东省总工会传达了全国总工会“一年内把工人阶级组织起来”的决议；省人民政府生产部也召开了全省公营轻工业会议，对各厂的行政领导和工会组织未能很好配合和以发展生产为中心工作的错误作了批判，并提出和实行了整编节约、规定经营标准和工作标准、逐步建立经济核算制等工作。同时，工会工作干部也认真克服关门主义偏向，陆续吸收了百分之八十的工人参加了工会组织，并依靠他们在各厂普遍展开物资清理工作，建立了原材料的详细盘存制度，成立了工厂管理委员会，重新订立劳动纪律和奖惩制度，有些厂更采用了超额奖励工资制。经过这些改进后，生产工作始步入正规。济南成大纱厂去年九月间的每日产纱量由二十六件增至三十件。济南面粉厂去年十月份每小时产粉量比九月份提高了百分之三十五。徐州油厂去年十月至十二月产油量亦由十二槽增到十四槽。
    目前山东公营轻工业工厂生产中的问题是缺乏严密的计划性，原料物资的收发保管工作中缺乏科学的管理制度，因而浪费现象仍重，成本较高；同时已建立的工厂管理委员会大部流于形式。二月中山东省人民政府生产部先后召开的各业厂长会议，已对上述问题进行了检查，并准备有计划地改进经营管理工作。
