Xinhua News Agency, 24th: According to Jinan Dazhong Daily, technical workers at the Jinan Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory's research lab, having begun to change their impractical and unrealistic working style, have made considerable contributions in improving operational methods and resolving technical difficulties arising from adapting to existing raw materials and equipment in the two months of December and January. Due to improvements in operational methods, the production cost of phosphoric acid has been reduced by 45.4%, saving 470,000 yuan per day. While the purity of ferric phosphate has been improved, production costs have also been reduced by using some ferric sulfate to replace sulfuric acid and iron powder. In the past, the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory had a large stockpile of potassium nitrate that could not be sold and was not used internally. Now, thanks to the efforts of the technical workers, the factory can use this batch of potassium nitrate to manufacture urgently needed potassium chlorate. Sodium carbonate, one of the raw materials for manufacturing monosodium phosphate, has been proven by the research lab's experiments to be replaceable by locally produced, inexpensive sodium sulfate. According to statistics, this can save 30% of sulfuric acid and 90% of sodium carbonate, not only reducing the raw material cost of producing monosodium phosphate by 27.7%, but also simplifying production procedures and reducing labor costs. In the past, the technical workers at Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory rarely went to the actual production process to identify problems and did not promptly resolve technical difficulties in production. They often could not decide what work should be done based on existing raw materials, equipment, and economic value. For example, from 1946 to 1949, the research lab tested more than 100 projects, of which less than 50 were formally implemented in production. Others were either not needed in production or were stopped midway due to difficulties in the experiments. These failed experiments often took six months to a year, costing a great deal and not solving practical problems in production. Since last November, when the factory's administrative leadership called on technical workers to find experiment topics in production, use local materials, make plans according to conditions, and use flexible research methods, the factory's technical personnel have begun to pay attention to practical problems in production and have achieved significant results in a short period of time. This has also greatly strengthened their confidence in closely integrating future research and experimentation with production.

　　济南新华药厂工作改进
    磷酸成本降低一半
    【新华社二十四日讯】据济南大众日报载，济南新华药厂研究室的技术工作者由于开始改变好高鹜远、不切实际的工作作风，在十二月和一月两个月中，已在改进操作法、解决为适应现有原料设备而产生的技术困难等方面有了相当的贡献。由于操作法的改进，磷酸的生产成本已减低了百分之四五·四、一天可以节省四十七万元。与磷酸铁的纯度得到改进的同时，生产成本也因为改用一部分硫酸铁来代替硫酸和铁粉而降低了。过去新华药厂的仓库里存有大量硝酸钾卖不出去，自己又用不上。现在由于技术工作者的努力，该厂已可利用这一批硝酸钾来制造急需的氯酸钾。作为制造第一磷酸钠的原料之一的炭酸钠，经研究室的实验证明可用附近出产的价廉的硫酸钠来代替。据统计这可节省硫酸百分之三十、炭酸钠百分之九十，不仅生产第一磷酸钠的原料成本可降低百分之二七·七，而且生产手续简便，工资成本也可降低。过去新华药厂的技术工作者很少到生产实际过程中去发现问题，没有及时解决生产中的技术困难，往往不能根据现有的原料设备等条件以及经济价值的大小等来决定应做的工作。如研究室从一九四六年到一九四九年中，总计试验项目一百多种，其中正式提到生产上的不足五十种。其他不是生产上不需要，便是试验中发生困难中途停止。这些失败的试验，往往费时半年到一年，费用既大，又没有解决生产中的实际问题。自去年十一月该厂行政领导部门提出技术工作者到生产中去找试验题目，就地取材，根据条件做打算，研究方法机动灵活等号召后，该厂技术人员们才开始重视了生产中的实际问题，并在短时期内获得显著成绩，同时也大大加强了今后研究试验工作与生产紧密结合的信心。
