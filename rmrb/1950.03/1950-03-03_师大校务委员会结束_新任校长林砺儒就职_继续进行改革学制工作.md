The End of the Normal University School Affairs Committee, New President Lin Liru Takes Office
Continuing the Reform of the Academic System
[Our Newspaper] The National Normal University School Affairs Committee concluded yesterday (the 2nd), and the new President Lin Liru took office at the same time. Since the last semester, the university has been conducting research on reforming the academic system under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, and has completed preliminary work. It has now been decided to change the School Affairs Committee system, which has been in place since the takeover, to a presidential system, in order to continue the second phase of improvement work. Yesterday, more than 1,400 faculty, students, and staff of the university held a grand gathering. After the announcement of the end of the School Affairs Committee and the inauguration of the new president, Vice Minister of Education Wei Que spoke. He first pointed out that education should be carried out in accordance with the needs of the revolution. He specifically explained that the new direction of the Normal University is to grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to move towards the direction of the people; the task of the Normal University is to train middle school teachers for New China. He said that the research of profound knowledge should not be viewed in isolation from teaching methods, but should be viewed dialectically, because good educators must have a good foundation of knowledge, so the research of knowledge should not and cannot be separated from teaching methods. Vice Minister Wei further helped the students correct some incorrect ideas, such as not wanting to be a teacher and coming to the Normal University for schooling at public expense. Jiao Juyin, the representative of the United Association of Education Workers of the Normal University, said, "I represent the trade union to welcome President Lin and support the correct policy of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education on the reform of the Normal University; at the same time, I guarantee to work hard in teaching and production, and under the guidance of the administration." Finally, student representative Dai Hao, on behalf of all the students of the Normal University, extended a warm welcome to the new president. President Lin Liru said in his inaugural speech that the future teaching work of the Normal University will follow the instructions of the Ministry of Education, and should be based on the basic principles of planned teaching and purposeful learning to complete the new and important tasks.

　　师大校务委员会结束  新任校长林砺儒就职
    继续进行改革学制工作
    【本报讯】国立师范大学校务委员会于昨（二）日结束，新任校长林砺儒同时就职。该校自上学期起，即在教育部领导下进行研究改革学制，已完成了初步工作。现决定将接管以来的校务委员会制改为校长制，以继续进行第二阶段的改进工作。昨日该校师生员工一千四百余人举行了盛大的集会。会上宣布校务委员会结束与新任校长就职之后，教育部韦悫副部长讲话：他首先指出：教育是要配合革命的需要来进行的。他具体地说明：师大的新方向是要掌握马列主义与毛泽东思想，走向人民的方向；师大的任务是培养新中国的中等师资，训练：不要把高深学问的研究和教学方法孤立起来看，而应该辩证地来看。因为好的教育工作者必须有好的学问作基础，所以学问的研究不应也不能与教学法分离的。韦副部长更帮助同学纠正一些不正确的思想，如不愿当教师及为公费而到师大来上学等。师大教育工作者联合会的代表焦菊隐说，我代表工会欢迎林校长及拥护中央人民政府教育部对师大改制的正确政策；同时保证在教学与生产中、在行政的指导下好好进行工作。最后由学生会代表戴昊同学代表全体师大的同学向新校长致热烈的欢迎。林砺儒校长在就职讲演中说：师大今后教学工作的进行，将遵照教育部的指示，应该以有计划的教和有目的的学为基本原则，来完成新的重大任务。（师大通讯组）
