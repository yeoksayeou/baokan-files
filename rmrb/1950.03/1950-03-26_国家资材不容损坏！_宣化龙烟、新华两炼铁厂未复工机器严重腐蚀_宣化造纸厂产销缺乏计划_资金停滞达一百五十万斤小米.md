National Resources Must Not Be Damaged!
	Xuanhua Longyan and Xinhua Iron and Steel Plants' Un-restarted Machinery is Severely Corroded.
	Xuanhua Paper Mill Lacks Production and Sales Planning.
	Capital is Stagnant, Reaching 1.5 Million Jin of Millet.
[This newspaper, Xuanhua, 23rd dispatch] Special correspondent Li Yi reports: Under the general principle of prioritizing restoration, how to properly protect all kinds of machinery and equipment in factories and mines that are currently unable to be restored, and prepare early for future full restoration and use, is one of the most noteworthy issues in industrial construction. The Xuanhua Longyan and Xinhua Iron and Steel Plants, which possess fifteen 20-ton iron-smelting furnaces and once produced more than 250 tons of pig iron per day, are in an extremely dangerous state due to the lack of active protection of mechanical equipment, leaving them to natural corrosion. In these two iron and steel plants, from ore furnaces and hot blast stoves to winches and other machinery, are covered in rust and completely unrecognizable. In the Xinhua Iron and Steel Plant, two winches and their motors have been eroded by rain and snow for more than a year due to the shedding of lead roofing. If this situation is allowed to develop, the future restoration of the two iron and steel plants will suffer major difficulties. The Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant is one of the iron and steel industries in North China with excellent development conditions. Among the two iron and steel plants, except for the Longyan Iron and Steel Plant, whose hot blast equipment is outdated and needs to be modified to meet scientific use, so the restoration of production may take a longer time, the coking and iron-smelting equipment of the Xinhua Iron and Steel Plant is generally relatively complete and easier to restore. Xuanhua is less than 240 kilometers west of the Datong Coal Mine, which contains a large amount of coking coal, and only 43 kilometers east of the Pangjiabao Iron Mine, which has the largest iron sand reserves in our country. Under such circumstances, in order to fully utilize the existing iron-smelting equipment in the future, spending a certain amount of resources and manpower to actively protect and organize the existing mechanical equipment, such as oiling the existing machinery and repairing the partially collapsed winch room, has significant positive significance.
[This newspaper, Xuanhua, 22nd dispatch] Reporter Li Yi reports: The Xuanhua Paper Mill, affiliated to the North China Paper Company of the Ministry of Light Industry, which officially resumed work at the end of last year, has blindly engaged in production, resulting in an inventory of more than 10,000 reams of various types of paper, causing capital stagnation of 1.5 million jin of millet. This urgently needs to attract the attention of the responsible department. According to the person in charge of the factory, the main reason for the above-mentioned serious situation is that the factory lacks meticulous planning for the entire production process; and there is no clear prediction of how to sell products. In January of this year, the person in charge of the factory devoted most of their time to the purchase and transportation of raw materials, but they knew very little about the market demand for paper. Since February, after sending people to promote sales along the Jing-Sui Railway, as of the middle of this month, the number of paper sold is less than 200 reams. The reason is that the various types of paper produced by the factory, such as newsprint used by ordinary flatbed presses, have dull colors and insufficient toughness due to impure raw materials and improper matching, so although the selling price is only three-quarters of its cost, it is not welcomed by users. The main problems facing the factory are improving papermaking technology, vigorously improving paper quality, and reducing production costs. At the same time, it is also hoped that the North China Paper Company will quickly find a way to unify the transportation and sales of the factory's products, and assist the factory in changing the current situation of stagnant capital turnover. (Note: The Xuanhua Paper Mill is one of the large-scale factories in North China that uses machines to make paper. Currently, one Fourdrinier paper machine is running, which can produce more than 160 reams of newsprint per day.)

　　国家资材不容损坏！
    宣化龙烟、新华两炼铁厂未复工机器严重腐蚀
    宣化造纸厂产销缺乏计划
    资金停滞达一百五十万斤小米
    【本报宣化二十三日讯】特派记者李翼报导：在重点恢复的总方针下，如何妥善保护目前暂无力恢复之厂、矿各类机械设备，并为未来充分恢复使用及早准备，是工业建设上最值得注意的问题之一。拥有十五部二十吨炼铁炉，日产生铁曾达二百五十吨以上之宣化龙烟、新华两炼铁厂，由于机械设备缺乏积极保护，任凭自然腐蚀，已处于极危险状态。该两炼铁厂，自熔矿炉、热风包到绞车等机械，均已铁锈丛生，面目全非。新华炼铁厂有两部绞车及其电机，因屋顶铅皮脱落，遭雨雪侵蚀已达一年以上。此种情况如任其发展，将使未来两炼铁厂之恢复遭受重大困难。按宣化炼铁厂是华北区具有优良发展条件的钢铁业之一。两炼铁厂中，除龙烟炼铁厂因热风设备陈旧，需加改装，以符科学使用，因而恢复生产可能需时较长外，新华炼铁厂之炼焦炼铁等设备，大体尚称完整，恢复较易。宣化西距蕴藏有大量粘结性煤炭之大同煤矿不及二百四十公里，东距我国蕴藏铁砂最多之庞家堡铁矿场仅四十三公里。在这样情况下，为了未来充分利用已有之炼铁设备，花费一定数量的资材、人力，设法积极保护、整理现有各项机械设备，如将现有机械涂油及修补已局部坍塌之绞车房等，是有着重大的积极意义的。
    【本报宣化二十二日讯】记者李翼报导：去年末已正式复工的轻工业部华北造纸公司所属宣化造纸厂，由于盲目进行生产，致库存各类纸张一万余令，使资金因而停滞不得运用者达一百五十万斤小米。亟应引起主管部门注意。据该厂负责人谈称，造成上述严重情况的主要原因，是厂方对于整个生产过程缺乏周密计划；对于产品销路如何亦无明晰预见。本年一月份，该厂负责人大部时间致力于原料的购买与运输等，但对于市场纸张需求情况却很少了解。二月以来，经派人至京绥沿线推销，截至本月中旬，售出纸张为数尚不及二百令。原因是该厂所出各类纸张，如普通平板机所用的新闻纸等，由于原料不纯，配合不当，致纸色灰暗，韧性不足，故其出售价格，虽仅为其成本的四分之三，亦不为用户所欢迎。摆在该厂面前的主要问题，乃是提高造纸技术，大力改进纸张质量，减低生产成本。同时亦望华北造纸公司尽速设法统一运销该厂产品，协助该厂改变目前资金周转停滞的情况。（按：宣化造纸厂系华北区使用机器造纸之大型工厂之一，目前开动一部圆网式造纸机，日可产新闻纸一百六十余令。）
