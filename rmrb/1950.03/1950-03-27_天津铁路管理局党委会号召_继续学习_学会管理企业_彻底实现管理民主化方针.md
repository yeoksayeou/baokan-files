　　The Party Committee of the Tianjin Railway Administration Calls For Continued Study of "Learn to Manage Enterprises" to Thoroughly Realize the Policy of Management Democratization

[Our Newspaper] The Party Committee of the Tianjin Railway Administration held an enlarged meeting on the 13th and 14th of this month. Based on the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," the meeting specifically discussed the work of implementing management democratization throughout the railway. After listening to a report from Deputy Director Liu Jianzhang of the Administration on the work of the Road Management Committee, the Party Committee believed that after nearly a year of publicity, education, and organizational work on the Tianjin Railway, Management Committees had been established in 51 factories, sections, and stations. It had absorbed 638 (according to statistics from only 47 Management Committees) worker and staff backbone members to participate in enterprise management, enabling the Management Committees to play a considerable role in improving railway transportation, with the Fengtai Locomotive Depot and 10 other units achieving the best results. However, there are currently 22 production units that have not yet established Management Committees. In the ideological style of some leading cadres, there is still bureaucracy, and they even distrust the power of the workers, using the excuse that "employees' old habits have not been completely eliminated" to delay the establishment of Management Committees (such as the Tianjin Materials Factory). Even in the established Management Committees, a few have not played a role in discussing and deciding on major work, and the section chiefs and factory directors are still issuing orders. Most of the responsible cadres in the Administration's various departments have not paid attention to the work of the Management Committees. For example, the director of the Engineering Department mistakenly believed that "the Management Committee is an organization led by the Party and the Trade Union," so the administration did not pay enough attention. Director Liu of the Telecommunications Department has never cared about the work of the Management Committees in various sections in his daily work. The Party Committee believes that one of the important reasons is that the leading cadres' thinking is not clear. At the same time, it also pointed out that this kind of thinking is inconsistent with the policies of the Party and the government, and the whole Party must resolutely and quickly correct it. To this end, the Party Committee decided to further carry out publicity and education work on relying on the working class to implement management democratization among all Party member cadres throughout the railway, calling on all Party members to continue to study in depth the editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," overcome bureaucratic thinking and style, and thoroughly transform the management system of railway enterprises. Newspapers will also be used to conduct criticism and self-criticism of bureaucratic thinking and style in railway enterprises.

### 天津铁路管理局党委会号召  继续学习“学会管理企业”彻底实现管理民主化方针

　　天津铁路管理局党委会号召
    继续学习“学会管理企业”彻底实现管理民主化方针
    【本报讯】天津铁路管理局党委会，于本月十三、十四两日举行扩大会议，根据人民日报“学会管理企业”的社论，专门讨论了全路实行管理民主化的工作。党委会在听取了管理局刘建章副局长关于全路管委会工作情况的报告以后，认为天津铁路上经过将近一年的宣传教育与组织工作，已在五十一个厂、段、站内建立起管委会，并且吸收了六百三十八个（只据四十七个管委会的统计）工人和职员骨干分子参加企业的管理，使管委会在提高铁路运输上起了相当大的作用，其中以丰台机务段等十一个单位成绩最好。但目前尚有二十二个生产单位没有建立管委会。在部分领导干部的思想作风上，还存在着官僚主义，甚至不相信工人群众的力量，借口“职工们旧习气未能彻底消除”而拖延管委会的成立（如天津材料厂）。即使在已成立的管理委员会中，也有少数的并未起讨论和决定重大工作的作用，依然只是段长、厂长命令行事。在管理局各处负责干部中，多数也没有重视管委会工作，如工务处于处长误认为“管委会是党和工会领导的机构”，因而行政上没有充分注意。电务处刘处长在日常工作中，一直没有关心过各段管委会的工作。党委会认为：其重要原因之一，就是领导干部思想不明确。同时并指出：这种思想是与党和政府的政策不相符的，全党必须坚决迅速纠正。为此党委会决定：在全路党员干部中进一步开展依靠工人阶级实行管理民主化的宣传教育工作，号召全体党员继续深入学习“学会管理企业”的社论，克服官僚主义的思想作风，彻底改造铁路企业的管理制度。并运用报纸，对铁路企业中的官僚主义思想作风，进行批评与自我批评。
