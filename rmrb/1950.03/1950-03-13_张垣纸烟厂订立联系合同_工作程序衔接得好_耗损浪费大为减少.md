The Zhangyuan Cigarette Factory under the Department of Industry of Chahar Province formally signed linkage contracts on the 4th of this month in order to overcome certain disconnections in the production process. At the beginning of the preparation, some workers had many incorrect views on the linkage contracts: some believed that signing contracts was "restricting themselves." Some were afraid of "taking responsibility," such as the packaging room, which stated: "We still have to pick out the bad cigarettes sent by the rolling room, which affects the completion of the packaging task." The rolling room stated: "The tobacco shreds sent by the cutting room are not up to standard in terms of dryness and humidity, and there are too many impurities; the heating in the workshop is also insufficient, which affects the cigarette standard," and a series of other problems. The Party, government, and labor union leaders of the factory conducted systematic and specific research in the workshops to dispel the workers' concerns and incorrect views, and widely solicited the opinions of technicians and skilled workers. At the same time, they educated the workers with facts, improving their understanding of linkage contracts. Subsequently, heated discussions were launched in various workshops, with group meetings held to discuss group production plans, propose mutual guarantees and required conditions, and initially formulate contract conditions. Then, the factory management committee, labor union, and other organizations discussed the matter many times and drafted a contract draft. The draft was then distributed to various workshops and further discussed, supplemented, and revised at the general meeting of all employees, so that the contract could fully concentrate the opinions of the workers and promote their production enthusiasm.

Since the formal signing of the linkage contracts, the past problems of disconnection in various work procedures have been gradually overcome. For example, the cutting room guarantees a daily output of 3,751 kilograms of tobacco shreds, with clear standards for the thickness and dryness of the tobacco shreds. On the basis of the above tobacco shreds standard, the rolling room also guarantees the specifications and quantity of the cigarettes, reducing the paper consumption rate to 1.6% (the average consumption last year was 4.26%), and the number of defective products per machine per day does not exceed 700. The packaging room also guarantees to pack the cigarettes of the day within one day, at most not exceeding one and a half days. Due to the correct implementation of the linkage contracts, many wasteful phenomena have been reduced. (Zhang Yi, Ji Ming)

　　张垣纸烟厂订立联系合同
    工作程序衔接得好  耗损浪费大为减少
    【本报讯】察省工业厅所属张垣纸烟厂，为克服生产过程中的某些脱节现象，已于本月四日正式签订联系合同。在开始酝酿时，部分工人对联系合同有很多不正确的看法：有的认为订合同就是“约束自己”。有的怕“负责任”，如包装室则提出：“卷烟室送来的坏烟我们还得拣，影响完成包装任务。”卷烟室提出：“调切室送来烟丝，干湿度不合标准，杂的东西太多；工作间暖气也不够，都影响烟支标准”等一系列的问题。该厂党、政、工领导上为打破工人的顾虑和不正确的看法，深入车间作了系统地具体研究工作，并广泛征求了技工、熟练工人的意见，同时以事实在工人中进行教育，提高了他们对联系合同的认识。继而在各车间展开热烈的酝酿，多次召开小组会讨论小组生产计划，提出互相保证和所要求的条件，初步订出合同条件，再由工厂管委会、工会等多次讨论，拟成合同草案。然后又发到各车间，在全体职工大会上再加讨论、补充修正，使合同能够充分集中工人群众的意见，以发扬工人们的生产积极性。
    自正式签订联系合同后，过去存在各工作程序不衔接的症结，均已逐步得到克服。如调切室保证日出烟丝三千七百五十一公斤，烟丝粗细和干湿度均有明确标准。卷烟室在上述烟丝标准基础上，也保证烟支的规格和数量，使盘纸耗损率降到百分之一点六（去年平均耗损是百分之四点二六），每日每台机车废品不超过七百支。包装室也保证了一天内装完当天的烟支，最多不超过一天半。由于联系合同的正确实现，因而减少了很多浪费现象。（张毅、季明）
