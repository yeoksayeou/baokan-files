　　Sujiatun Abrasive Wheel Factory
    Zero Defective Products in February

    [This Newspaper reports] The firing team of the Sujiatun Abrasive Wheel Factory created a new record of zero defective products in February. In the past, this team fired twelve or thirteen kilns of abrasive wheels or oilstones each month, with defective products accounting for 10 percent of the total. In order to reduce costs and improve quality, the entire team held a meeting to review and investigate the reasons. The main reason was that individual workers lacked a strong sense of responsibility and did not pay attention to mastering the firing operation methods, resulting in uneven firing and increased defective products. After a detailed discussion at the meeting and education for the workers with a weak sense of responsibility, none of the thirteen kilns of abrasive wheels fired in February had any defective products, and everyone's production enthusiasm was extremely high.

　　苏家屯砂轮工厂
    二月份无一废品
    【本报讯】苏家屯砂轮工厂烧成班，二月份创造了没有废品的新纪录。该班过去每月烧十二、三窑砂轮或油石，废品总占百分之十。为降低成本，提高质量，全班工人曾集会检讨，追究其原因，主要是个别工人责任心不强，不注意掌握烧火操作法，火烧的不均，致废品增多。经过会议详尽讨论，对责任心不强的工人进行了教育，结果二月份烧十三窑砂轮中，没有一个废品，大家生产情绪极高。
