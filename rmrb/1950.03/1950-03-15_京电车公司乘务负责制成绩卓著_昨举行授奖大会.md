　　Beijing Tram Company's Responsibility System Achieves Remarkable Results
    Award Ceremony Held Yesterday
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Public Tram Company held its November-December 1949 Responsibility System performance award ceremony and ring road mobilization rally at the company's auditorium yesterday (the 14th) at 3:00 PM. Over two hundred employees and representatives from various award-winning units attended.
    The venue was solemnly decorated and filled with joy. At the meeting, representatives from the administration, the trade union, and guests spoke successively. The company's manager, Wang Zhenwu, personally awarded prizes to the seventeen model crew groups and thirty-one model workers selected by the evaluation committee. When these model workers received their awards, the entire workforce applauded enthusiastically and shouted slogans, expressing their determination to emulate the model workers.
    Since the implementation of the crew responsibility system in November and December of last year, the company has achieved remarkable results in these two months. Due to the workers' increased sense of responsibility for the vehicles, the failure rate dropped rapidly from 21% to 8%, and gradually changed from major failures to minor failures. Ticket revenue and mileage have also increased relatively, while incidents of cancellations, delays, and accidents have been greatly reduced. These are concrete manifestations of the achievements made after the implementation of the crew responsibility system. For example, the 18th crew group, which won the special award this time, is a typical example. This group never had a single breakdown in the fifty days of implementing the crew responsibility system. They worked actively and responsibly, never had any accidents, and had a very good attitude towards passengers. In the speeches of the administration, the trade union, and the workers, it was unanimously emphasized that the achievement of this time was mainly due to the unity and efforts of all staff. Manager Wang Zhenwu said, "Our award this time is based on everyone's common progress. This crew responsibility system shows that our workers' awareness has generally improved, and everyone has taken a step forward." He also called on all employees to implement the spirit of this crew responsibility system into the ring road movement and continue to work hard to complete the new tasks assigned by the higher authorities. He said, "The basic spirit of our change in the ring road route this time is to facilitate the citizens, further seek benefits for the citizens of Beijing, and gain the trust of the citizens. Changing the ring road will naturally still have difficulties, such as the fourth tram line being single-track, but we must give play to the workers' class consciousness to overcome these difficulties. The success or failure of this ring road is a political test for our working class." Mu Zexian, the director of the Industry Bureau, called on workers to complete ten tasks: strive for passengers; increase mileage; ensure on-time running; reduce breakdowns; save electricity; no collisions or accidents; no cancellations or delays; good attitude, no missed tickets; keep vehicles clean; establish proper driving standards. When the workers spoke freely, they all expressed their determination to strive to be models next time and promised to complete the task of changing the ring road this time.

　　京电车公司乘务负责制成绩卓著
    昨举行授奖大会
    【本报讯】北京市公营电车公司昨（十四）日下午三时在该公司大礼堂举行一九四九年十一、十二两月份乘务负责制考绩发奖暨实行环路动员大会。出席职工及各受奖单位代表二百余人。
    会场布置庄严隆重，充满喜气。在会上，行政、工会、来宾都相继讲话，并由该公司经理王镇武亲自向这次被评委会选出的十七个模范乘务组和三十一位模范工作者授奖。当这些模范工作者受奖时，全场职工热烈鼓掌，欢呼口号，表示要向模范工作者看齐。
    自去年十一、十二两月实行乘务负责制以来，在两个月当中该公司获得了显著成绩。由于工人们加强了对车辆的责任心，使坏车率由百分之二十一迅速减至百分之八，并且逐渐由大坏改为小坏。在票款收入和行车公里上也相对增加，而脱班、迟到、事故等现象则大为减少。这些都是实行乘务负责制后获得的成绩的具体表现。如这次荣获特奖的第十八乘务小组即是一个典型的例子。该组在实行乘务负责制的五十天中，从未坏车一次，工作积极负责，行车从未发生任何事故，对乘客态度也很好。在行政工会以及工人讲话中，都一致强调这次成绩的获得，主要是由于全体工作人员的团结和努力的结果。王镇武经理说：“我们这次的奖励是建筑在大家共同进步的基础上。这次的乘务负责制，说明我们工人的觉悟都普遍提高，大家都进了一步。”他并号召全体职工要把这次乘务负责制的精神贯彻到环行运动中去，继续努力完成上级所给与的新任务。他说：“我们这次要改变环行路线的基本精神是为了便利市民，进一步为北京市民谋福利，并取得市民对我们的信任。改变环行自然还有困难，如第四路电车是单轨，但我们要发挥工人阶级的自觉性来克服这些困难。这次环行得好坏是对我们工人阶级的政治考验。”工业局长牟泽衔号召工人完成十项任务：争取乘客；增加行车公里；保证走正点；减少坏车；节省电流；不撞车不肇祸；不脱班不迟到；态度好、不漏票；车辆保持清洁；建立正当司运标准。工人们自由讲话时，一致表示要争取在下次做模范。并保证完成这次改变环行路的任务。
