[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau, in light of recent accidents occurring in warehouses in various locations, and to ensure air defense, fire prevention, anti-espionage, and mold prevention during the mold season to avoid accidental losses of state property, has, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, Fire Brigade, and other relevant units, organized a warehouse inspection team. Over the past two weeks, they have inspected the equipment and general management of warehouses belonging to several specialized branch companies in Beijing. To quickly study and resolve some of the problems discovered during the inspection process, the Municipal Commercial Bureau convened a joint meeting of the heads of storage and transportation sections and warehouse directors from various specialized companies in Beijing on the 25th at the bureau.

At the meeting, Zhang Jincheng, Deputy Director of the Commercial Bureau, first summarized and reported on the results of the inspection, pointing out several urgent problems that need to be resolved: First, the allocation and use of warehouses are unreasonable. For example, three grain warehouses are far exceeding their reasonable capacity, which will cause serious difficulties and dangers in storage. Also, while the department store's warehouses are insufficient, with some warehouses full to the point of goods being placed in the yard, others are quite empty. If these warehouses are comprehensively classified, adjusted, and used according to the nature of the existing items, some difficulties can be resolved. Second, a clear storage system should be established. With the development of state-owned trade, state goods will inevitably be stored centrally. Therefore, various systems such as warehouse receiving and dispatching systems, inspection systems, warehouse rules, assessment and reward/punishment systems, and rotation and leave systems urgently need to be established, but currently, various companies are not paying enough attention to this. Third, storage methods should be improved. Stacking goods in some warehouses not only wastes space and looks messy but also lacks a scientific method, making it difficult for managers to grasp the complete situation of the goods in a timely manner. In the future, item distribution maps should be set up according to category and consolidation, and if items are related to natural conditions, it is best to have explanations so that they can be monitored at any time. Higher levels should also pay attention to this in advance when allocating items. Fourth, cadres should be appropriately allocated. Storage should be the central task of the warehouse, but currently, storage personnel in grain warehouses account for only about one-tenth of the total number of employees in the warehouse. Sometimes, one storage worker is responsible for storing a large amount of grain, making it difficult to conduct timely inspections for mold, insects, ventilation, and rain protection. When allocating cadres, the number of storage personnel required for the entire warehouse should be determined according to the individual's general work ability and a reasonable allocation should be made, and storage should be rationally divided according to the type and nature of the goods. At the same time, leaders should also find ways to supplement warehouse management staff. Fifth, a strict inspection system should be established. Currently, only the Grain Branch Company has established three systems: personal inspection by storage cadres, regular daily inspections by the storage and transportation section, and occasional mixed inspections by various company units. Other companies have not paid enough attention to this. In the future, each warehouse should strictly implement entry standards, and items should be properly sorted before being put into the warehouse. In addition, inspection record systems and reporting systems should be implemented.

In addition to the above five issues, Deputy Director Zhang also explained the following three points of attention: In terms of mold prevention, timely research on turning over stockpiles and moisture-proof measures should be conducted. In terms of anti-espionage, close contact with the troops, the government, and the masses should be maintained. In terms of air defense and fire prevention, vigilance should be strengthened, and not just in form. Individual warehouses that do not have sufficient water sources and fire-fighting equipment must be resolved as soon as possible.

After Deputy Director Zhang's report, the heads of storage and transportation sections and warehouse directors from various specialized branch companies spoke one after another, fully agreeing with the Commercial Bureau's summary of the inspection of the warehouses, believing that this type of inspection is very necessary.

The meeting finally decided that each warehouse should formulate specific plans to strengthen equipment and management as soon as possible and submit them to the competent authorities for approval and implementation.

　　加强防空防火防特防霉
    京市检查仓库设备及其管理工作
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府商业局鉴于近来各地仓库时有意外事件发生，为注意防空、防火、防特及在霉季中防霉工作，避免国家资财遭受意外损失，曾会同公安局、消防大队等有关单位组织仓库检查小组，在过去两周中分别检查了京市几个专业分公司所属仓库的设备及一般管理工作。为迅速研究解决在检查过程中所发现的一些问题，市商业局并于二十五日召集京市各专业公司储运科长及仓库主任在该局举行联席会议。会上，商业局张锦城副局长首先总结报告了这次检查结果，他指出了目前迫切需要解决的几个问题：一、仓库的分配、使用不合理。如有三个粮库都超过合理容量很多，因之在保管上便会有严重困难和危险；又如百货公司的仓库虽已不足，有的库很满，甚至把货放在院里，但也有的库却很空，如将这些仓库就现存物品的性质全面分类调整使用，还是可以解决部分困难的。二、应建立明确保管制度，由于国营贸易的开展，国家货物必将集中保管，因此各种制度如仓库收发制度、检查制度、仓库守则、考核奖惩制度、更替休假制度等，亟需建立，而目前各公司都还注意不够。三、储存方式应该改善。有的仓库码堆货物不但浪费地方，显得很乱，没有科学方法，主管人员很难及时掌握物品的全部情况。此后应按类归并设置物品分布图，其物品与自然条件有关系的，最好能有说明，以便随时掌握。上级在拨进物品时，事先也应注意到此点。四、干部应适当分配。保管应作为仓库的中心任务，但现在粮库的保管人员只占全库总人数的约十分之一，有时一个保管员负责保管极多的粮食，很难及时进行发霉、生虫、通风、防雨等的检查。分配干部应按照个人一般工作能力，定出全库所需保管人员数字，作合理的分配，并应按照物品种类、性质进行合理分工的保管。同时，领导上也应设法补充仓库管理工作人员。五、应建立严格检查制度。目前除粮食分公司已建立了保管干部个人负责检查，储运科派人每日到库定期检查一次，及公司各单位临时进行混合检查等三种制度外，其他公司还注意不够。各库今后应做到严格实行入库标准，并要事先对物品妥善整理，然后入库，此外，实行检查记录制度，报告制度等。除了以上五个问题外，张副局长并说明下面三点应注意事项：在防霉方面，应及时研究倒囤、防潮的设置；在防特方面，应注意与部队、政府、群众密切联系；在防空、防火方面，要加强警惕，不要只重形式，个别仓库水源及消防器材尚准备不够的，必须早日解决。张副局长报告后，各专业分公司储运科及仓库负责人纷纷发言，完全同意商业局对各仓库进行检查的总结意见，认为这种检查是很必要的。会议最后决定，各仓库应尽速制订加强设备及管理工作的具体计划，报请主管机关批准实施。
