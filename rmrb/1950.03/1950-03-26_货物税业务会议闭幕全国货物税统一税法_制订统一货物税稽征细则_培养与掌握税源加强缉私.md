　　[This Newspaper News] Reporter Lu Chaoqi reports: In order to implement the unified tax law and achieve complete consistency in the steps and procedures of specific implementation, the National Goods Tax Business Conference convened by the State Taxation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Finance was held in Beijing from February 26th to March 13th. Twenty-eight representatives from the taxation bureaus of major administrative regions and major cities across the country attended the meeting. The central task of the meeting was to study and draft uniform national collection regulations based on the Goods Tax Regulations promulgated by the Government Administration Council and the experience of various regions in collecting goods tax. After reflecting on the situation in various regions and extensively exchanging experiences during the meeting, the representatives reached a consensus on the understanding of the Goods Tax Regulations. For example, the scope of taxable goods and whether a certain item should be taxed or not were clearly defined at the meeting. Previously, in some individual regions, there were instances where one region (Region A) believed that a certain good, such as fruit candy, should be taxed, while another region (Region B) believed it should not. For example, Region A believed that yellow paper should be taxed as ordinary paper, while Region B believed it should be taxed as superstitious paper. This situation will no longer exist in the future. More importantly, the meeting formulated a draft of uniform national goods tax collection regulations. In the future, the procedures for collection, declaration, use of certificates, and distribution standards will be unified nationwide.

　　For example, the issue of certificate usage was hotly debated at the meeting. The majority opinion was that simplifying the certificate system is the direction of the development of goods tax. Currently, the distribution procedures can be waived for certain specific commodities on a trial basis. However, in general, under the current situation where the individual economy still accounts for a large proportion and commodities are not yet standardized, abolishing the current distribution procedures would inevitably lead to item-by-item inspection during inspection. As a result, it would not only be difficult to check for tax-evading goods, but also merchants would feel even more inconvenienced. After careful study, the meeting reached a consensus, unified the certificate system, and overcame the phenomenon that occurred in the past where Region A did not issue distribution certificates due to inconsistent regulations, while Region B detained goods during inspection. In order to plug loopholes and increase tax revenue, the meeting also formulated strict measures based on the experience of various regions. In the past, some regions did not pay enough attention to inspection and anti-smuggling work, and the work was not strict enough. In addition, the various collection procedures were not unified, which allowed a few unscrupulous merchants to evade taxes. The state finances suffered losses, and the legitimate taxpayers in industry and commerce did not receive full protection. This time, on the one hand, consistency was achieved in various procedures; on the other hand, there was also extensive discussion on strengthening inspection and anti-smuggling issues. After exchanging the anti-smuggling methods and the experience of cultivating and mastering tax sources in various regions, and based on the Soviet experience introduced by experts and with reference to China's specific situation, detailed measures were formulated. It is expected that significant progress will be made in plugging loopholes and increasing tax revenue.

　　货物税业务会议闭幕全国货物税统一税法
    制订统一货物税稽征细则
    培养与掌握税源加强缉私
    【本报讯】记者陆超祺报道：为了贯彻统一的税法，在具体执行的步调手续上完全取得一致，中央财政部税务总局召集的全国货物税业务会议已于二月二十六日至三月十三日在北京举行，出席会议的有各大行政区全国各大城市税务局代表二十八人。会议的中心任务，是根据政务院公布的货物税条例和各地征货物税的经验，研究草拟全国统一的稽征细则。代表们在会议中反映了各地情况并广泛的交换了经验后，对于货物税条例在认识上已取得了一致。例如应税货物的范围、究竟某种东西该征不该征，在会议中得到了明确的结论。以前个别地区有时对一种货物如水果糖甲地认为应该征，乙地认为不应该征。比如黄表纸甲地认为应按普通纸类征税，乙地又认为应按迷信纸类征税。这种情形今后就不会存在。更重要的是会议制订了统一的货物税稽征细则草本。今后在稽征、报运、票证使用分运标准等手续上全国都要一致。
    例如票照使用问题，在会议上曾经过热烈的争论，结果大多数意见认为简化票照制度是货物税发展方向。目前对某些具体商品已可试行免去分运手续。但一般的说，在目前个体经济仍占很大部分，商品尚未标准化的情况下，废除了现行的分运手续在查验时必定形成了逐件查验。结果不仅不易查验漏税货物，而且在商民也会感到更加不便。经过细密研究，会议取得了一致的意见，统一了票照制度，克服了过去因各地规定未能一致而发生甲地不发分运照，而乙地在查验时又要扣货的现象。对于堵塞漏洞增加税收，会议中也根据了各地的经验，拟订严密的办法。以往由于检查缉私工作有些地区还不够重视，作的还不够严密，加上各项稽征手续上又未能统一，这样就给少数不法商人钻空子偷税，国家财政上既受到了损失，同时合法纳税的工商业，也就是没有得到了充分的保护。此次一面在各种手续上取得了一致；一面对加强检查缉私问题上也有广泛的讨论，把各地查缉办法及培养与掌握税源的经验，互相交流以后，又根据专家介绍的苏联经验，参照我国具体情况，订出了详密的办法。预料在堵塞漏洞增加税收上将有显著开展的。
