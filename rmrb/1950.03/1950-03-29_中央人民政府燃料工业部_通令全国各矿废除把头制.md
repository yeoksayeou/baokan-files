Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government fully agrees with the suggestion of the National Coal Miners' Union Representative Conference to abolish the Ba Tou system and issued a circular on the 21st of this month to abolish the Ba Tou system. The circular states:

　　The National Coal Miners' Union Representative Conference suggested that the Ministry completely abolish the Ba Tou system. The Ministry believes that this resolution is timely and fully agrees. It is hereby ordered that all mines nationwide, where the Ba Tou system of contracting labor has been superficially abolished but remnants are still retained, should be thoroughly eliminated immediately; those that remain completely unchanged should be thoroughly abolished immediately. Former Ba Tous shall not hold administrative management positions in the mines; those whose crimes are obvious and hated by the masses can be prosecuted by workers through legal procedures. Personnel employed by the original Ba Tous should be reviewed and retained or transferred based on the opinions of the workers and masses, considering whether their past behavior was upright and whether they have production experience. Workers and staff with technical experience and prestige among the masses should be boldly promoted to administrative management positions in order to implement the policy of democratic management and enterprise management, rapidly restore and develop the coal mining industry, and successfully complete the production tasks for 1950. The General Coal Mine Management Bureaus of major administrative regions, the Coal Mine Management Offices, and the Mining Bureaus not under the jurisdiction of the Management Bureaus should promptly formulate specific implementation measures and report the measures and experiences in implementation to the Ministry at any time.

    通令全国各矿废除把头制
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部完全同意全国煤矿工会代表会议废除把头制度的建议，并于本月二十一日发出通令，废除把头制度。通令称：
    全国煤矿工会代表会议建议本部彻底废除把头制，本部认为此项决议适合时宜，完全同意。兹特明令全国各矿凡对包工把头制度业已表面废除而其残余仍有保留者，应即彻底肃清；其原封未动依然存在者，应即彻底废除。原来把头不得在矿场担任行政管理工作；其罪恶昭彰群众痛恨者，工人可经过法律手续提出控告。原把头所雇用人员，应根据工人群众意见视其过去行为是否端正及其有无生产经验，分别审查留用或调用。对于在技术上有经验在群众中有威信的工人及职员，应大胆提拔到行政管理的岗位上来，以贯彻管理民主化及经营企业化的方针，迅速恢复与发展煤矿事业，顺利完成一九五○年的生产任务。各大行政区煤矿管理总局、各煤矿管理处及各不属于管理局的矿务局，应迅即定出具体执行办法，并将办法及在执行中的经验随时报部为要。
