　　Heroic Struggle of Jiangxi Working Women
　　As early as twenty-three years ago, under the personal education and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the working women of Jiangxi participated in various tasks and struggles of the land revolution movement just like the men, and achieved political, economic, and cultural liberation from the heroic struggle. In order to assist the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army) in winning the victory of the revolutionary war, in addition to actively completing production tasks in the rear, they also bravely went to the front line to deliver food to the troops, carry stretchers, deliver bullets, and care for the wounded. They encouraged and personally sent their husbands and sons to join the Red Army and directly fight against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang cruelly carried out five encirclements and suppressions against the Central People's Revolutionary Base, the women of Xingguo County worked day and night with their troops to launch a tenacious struggle against the enemy. During these arduous and great years, the husbands, sons, and sisters of Jiangxi's working women shed countless blood and sweat for the revolution.

　　After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist Japan in 1934, the women of the Jiangxi revolutionary base, who had been living free and happy lives, fell into new disasters. After occupying the Jiangxi revolutionary base, the Kuomintang fascist beasts forced all women who had freely married during the revolutionary period to implement a "price matching" system, "pricing" them from thirty to forty silver dollars based on their age and appearance and selling them. In Changgang, Sigang, and other four villages in Xingguo County alone, more than fifty freely married working women were "priced." The bandit gangs forced the families of Red Army soldiers to "remarry." In Xixi, Tangbei, and other four villages in Xingguo County alone, according to incomplete statistics, the young wives of twenty-eight Red Army soldiers were forcibly sold by the local reactionary regime.

　　Under the devastation and plunder of the Kuomintang reactionary government's exorbitant taxes and levies and the conscription of men, the rural economy of Jiangxi fell into bankruptcy, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. Many poor peasants were forced to sell their two- or three-year-old children to be "child brides" or "waiting-for-husband brides" (that is, marrying a girl to a male child before or just after birth). Therefore, it was common for a "waiting-for-husband bride" to be seventeen or eighteen years old, while her husband had just been born, or for a boy to be fifteen or sixteen years old, while his "child bride" was only a two- or three-year-old infant who had just been adopted. According to statistics, 52 out of 93 households in Deng Village, Nanchang County, had child brides and waiting-for-husband brides, creating an extremely unreasonable phenomenon in the rural marriage system. In addition, they were also subjected to rape, humiliation, and occupation by local despots and the Kuomintang bandit army. Xiao Jiabi, the bandit leader of Suichuan County, in addition to selling thirteen Red Army wives and children for one hundred to two hundred silver dollars each, also occupied more than twenty women from good families as his wives, concubines, and slaves.

　　Although the Chiang bandit gang was so arrogant and rampant, the women's confidence in the Red Army's return was not shaken in the slightest. In Zhugang Village near Ruijin City, there was a sixty-three-year-old Red Army mother, Liu Yangshi. Fifteen years ago, she sent her eldest son, Liu Shengfu, to join the Red Army and follow Chairman Mao on the Long March. She then exchanged her family's large ox for a small one and exchanged fifteen yuan and five jiao of Red Army banknotes, which she put into a bamboo tube and hid under the eaves. She often said, "When I see it, it's like seeing the Red Army and seeing Chairman Mao." Although time passed year after year, her hair turned white and her ears became deaf, but she had a strong faith: "The Red Army will definitely return." After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, many women still sent their husbands and sons to join the people's guerrillas in southern Jiangxi, Hunan-Jiangxi, and northeastern Jiangxi to continue fighting the enemy. Li Xiangxiang, a female hygienist in the guerrilla unit active in the Wuling Mountains of southern Jiangxi, rescued twelve guerrilla fighters from the front line in fifteen minutes. Women in Maoping Village, Hengfeng County, launched an anti-rape struggle against the bandit army. Seven or eight women twice used scissors and bedding to stab and suffocate two bandit soldiers to death and sent the captured guns to the guerrilla unit. Many revolutionary comrades and descendants of revolutionaries safely survived countless searches and pursuits by the enemy under the protection and concealment of the broad masses of working women. For example, Comrade Deng Hong, the current Director of the Department of Agriculture of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, was chased, searched, and surrounded by the enemy several times when he was doing secret work in Liling, but he safely survived under the painstaking cover of the women. Liu Bojian, the deceased Director of the General Political Department of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, had a child named Bao'er, who was only two years old at the time of the Long March. At that time, the Red Army entrusted him to an old lady in Wuyangwei Village, Ruijin County, to raise. For fifteen years, this old lady used all her heart to hide Bao'er and raise him to adulthood, leaving Comrade Bojian a revolutionary descendant. The People's Government, in order to reward the old lady, allocated twenty dan of grain to her to settle down and will continue to give her preferential treatment for her contribution to the revolution.

　　After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River at the end of April last year, the working women in the old liberated areas of northeastern Jiangxi first launched a wave of support for the front line. Wherever the People's Liberation Army went, the women actively carried out tasks such as boiling tea and delivering water, preparing houses and grain, cooking, sewing clothes, caring for the sick and wounded, and offering condolences to the troops, as enthusiastically as they had supported the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in the past. Then, many women sent their husbands and sons to participate in various revolutionary tasks. Xie Heyu, an old female Communist Party member in Xingguo County in her fifties, sent two sons to join the Red Army during the land revolutionary war. After the Red Army's Long March, she secretly kept her party membership card and looked forward to the Red Army's early return every day. When she learned while bedridden that the People's Liberation Army – the original Red Army – had returned to her, she was extremely happy. She immediately asked her daughter-in-law to carry her to the district government to visit her comrades who had been separated for a long time. After returning home, she called her only seventeen-year-old grandson to her and said, "I made revolution, your father made revolution, and you should also make revolution." Then she sent her grandson to the People's Government to participate in the work.

　　After the liberation of the entire territory of Jiangxi, the women actively participated in the work of suppressing bandits, opposing local despots, reducing rent, collecting grain, and producing for disaster relief. In the suppression of bandits, many women in northeastern Jiangxi actively sent their sons and persuaded their husbands to join the local armed forces. The movement to oppose local despots and reduce rent in dozens of counties such as Nanchang, Fengcheng, Jinxian, Suichuan, and Tonggu was rapidly developed due to the active participation of women. When fighting the big local despot Wang Keming in Zhuling Township, Guangfeng County, women accounted for 48 percent of the mass meeting. In the grain collection work, women in various places actively participated in evaluation, checking for hidden fields, urging grain delivery, and delivering grain. Lei Duodi, a working woman and county representative of the women's association in Xiaosi Township, Fourth District, Fengcheng, not only took the lead in paying her own grain but also actively organized other women to urge others to deliver grain on time. In the production for disaster relief movement, more than 180 women in Jinxian County participated in the construction of the Fuxing Dike, and each person was able to complete more than one and a half earthworks every day. After the autumn grain collection, the women in Xinfeng Town, Nancheng, immediately organized a weaving group, earning wages of thirty-eight shi and four dou of grain in thirty days. Due to the active participation of women in production to overcome the famine, the production for disaster relief movement in various parts of Jiangxi gradually deepened.

　　The working women of Jiangxi, who have initially gained liberation, are now actively展开ing cultural learning. Women's literacy classes have begun to be organized in some rural areas of Fenyi, Xingguo, Xinjian, Nanchang, Fengcheng, and other counties.

　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the liberated working women of Jiangxi have once again begun to live a life of complete equality with men in political, economic, and cultural affairs and have gradually established their own women's organizations. According to incomplete statistics from the three districts of Nanchang, Yuanzhou, and Shangrao alone, more than 45,200 working women have already been organized. In the Shangrao district, women's organizations have been established and developed in 2,029 out of 2,200 or more bao. The working women of Jiangxi, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, will surely exert greater strength in the great cause of building a new China in the future and in building a new Jiangxi – a new and happy homeland. 【Xinhua News Agency】

### 英勇斗争的江西劳动妇女们

　　英勇斗争的江西劳动妇女们
    江西的劳动妇女，远在二十三年前，即在中国共产党和毛主席的亲自教育和培养下，与男子们一样地参加了土地革命运动中的各项工作和斗争，从英勇的斗争中取得了政治上、经济上和文化上的解放。为了协助工农红军（即人民解放军前身）争取革命战争的胜利，她们除在后方积极完成生产任务外，还勇敢地到前线去给部队送饭、抬担架、送子弹、看护伤员。她们鼓励并亲自送自己的丈夫、儿子参加红军，直接去和蒋介石匪帮作战。当蒋介石匪帮残酷地向中央人民革命区进行五次围剿时，兴国县的妇女们，更是不分昼夜地配合着自己的军队向敌人展开了顽强的斗争。在这些艰苦伟大的岁月里，江西劳动妇女们的丈夫、儿子以及自己的姐妹们，曾为革命流了无数血汗。
    一九三四年中国工农红军北上抗日后，过着自由幸福生活的江西革命区妇女，从新陷入重重灾难中。国民党法西斯野兽们在侵占了江西革命区以后，对在革命时期自由结婚的妇女，一律强迫实行“配价”制度，根据妇女年龄、容貌“配价”三十到四十块银元，加以贩卖。仅兴国县长岗、泗纲等四个村，即有五十多个自由结婚的劳动妇女被“配”了“价”。对红军家属匪帮们强迫她们重新“改嫁”。仅兴国县新溪、塘背等四个村不完全统计：即有二十八个红军战士的年轻妻子被当地反动政权所强迫卖掉。
    在国民党反动政府的苛捐杂税、抓丁抓夫等苛政的摧残和掠夺之下，江西农村经济陷于破产，人民生活困苦不堪，很多贫苦农民被迫将自己两、三岁的儿女卖给人家去做“童养媳”或“望郎媳”（即男的尚未生下，为其娶媳等待之）。因此，常有望郎媳已十七、八岁，她的丈夫才刚出生；或男的已十五、六岁，他的童养媳才是刚收养来的两三岁的婴儿。据统计，南昌县邓村九十三户人家中即有五十二户有童养媳与望郎媳，造成农村婚姻制度的极不合理现象。此外，她们更遭受着恶霸地主及国民党匪军的奸淫凌辱和霸占。遂川县的匪首萧家璧除以一百至二百银元卖掉红军妻子、儿女十三名外，还霸占了二十多个良家妇女为其妻妾和奴婢。
    虽然蒋匪帮是那样的狂妄和横行，但妇女们盼望红军回来的信心并没有丝毫动摇过。瑞金城附近的竹岗村，有个六十三岁的红军妈妈刘杨氏，她十五年前将她的长子刘声富送入红军跟着毛主席参加了长征后，即将她家的大牛换成小牛，换回十五元五角红军钞票装到竹筒里，藏在屋檐角下。她常说：“我看见它，就像看见了红军，看见了毛主席一样。”时光虽然一年一年地过去了，她头发白了，耳朵聋了，但她有着一颗坚强的信心：“红军一定会回来的。”许多妇女在红军北上抗日后，仍送丈夫、儿子参加赣南、湘赣、赣东北的人民游击队，继续坚持与敌作战。活动在赣南五岭山上的游击队里的女卫生员李祥香，在十五分钟内即从火线上救出十二名游击队员。横峰县毛坪村的妇女，并向匪军展开反强奸斗争，七八个妇女曾两次以剪刀、被服刺死、闷死两个匪兵，并将所缴枪支送给了游击队。许多革命同志和革命的后代，在广大劳动妇女的保护、隐藏下，安全地渡过了敌人无数次的搜捕和追击。如现任江西省人民政府的农业厅厅长邓洪同志，过去在醴陵一带做秘密工作时，曾数次遭到敌人的追击、搜捕和包围，但都在妇女们千方百计的掩护下，安全渡过。已故的工农红军总政治部主任刘伯坚同志的孩子豹儿，长征时才两岁，红军当时曾把他托咐给瑞金县武阳围村的一个老太太抚养。十五年来，这位老太太用尽心机将豹儿隐蔽起来并扶养成人，给伯坚同志留下了革命后代。人民政府为奖励这位老太太，曾拨发粮食二十担给她安家，并因她对革命有功，将继续予以优待。
    去年四月底人民解放军渡江后，赣东北老解放区的劳动妇女，首先掀起支援前线的热潮。解放军所到之处，妇女们均积极进行烧茶送水、准备房屋粮草、做饭、缝衣、看护伤病员、慰问部队等工作，像支援从前的工农红军一样地热烈。接着，很多妇女即又送夫送子参加各种革命工作。兴国县五十多岁的女共产党员谢和育老太太，土地革命战争时期送走了两个儿子参加红军，红军长征后，她即将党证隐密的保存好，并天天盼望着红军能早些回来。当她在卧病中知道人民解放军——原来的红军已回到了她那里时，她高兴极了，她马上叫媳妇背着她到区政府去看望久别重逢的自己的同志。回家后，即把她唯一的十七岁的孙子叫到面前说：“我革命，你父亲革命，你也应该革命。”随后就把孙子送到人民政府参加了工作。
    江西全境解放后，妇女们又积极地参加了剿匪、反恶霸、减租、征粮和生产救灾等工作。在剿匪中，赣东北很多妇女踊跃送子劝夫参加地方武装。南昌、丰城、进贤、遂川、铜鼓等数十个县的反恶霸、减租运动，由于妇女们的积极参加而使运动迅速开展起来。广丰县珠岭乡斗争大恶霸王克明时，妇女即占到会群众的百分之四十八。征粮工作中各地妇女又积极参加了评议、查黑田、催粮、送粮等工作。丰城四区小泗乡的劳动妇女、妇女会县代表雷多第，在征粮中不但自己争先缴纳，并积极组织其他妇女推动别人按时交粮。在生产救灾运动中，进贤县一百八十多位妇女参加了修筑复兴堤的工作，每个人每天皆能完成一个半以上的土方。南城新丰镇的妇女们在秋征结束后，又立即组织纺织组，三十天中得工资三十八石四斗谷。由于妇女积极参加生产渡荒，江西各地生产救灾运动逐渐深入。
    初步得到翻身的江西劳动妇女，目前正积极展开文化学习。分宜、兴国、新建、南昌、丰城等县部分农村，已开始组织了妇女识字班。
    解放后的江西劳动妇女，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，又重新开始过着在政治上、经济上、文化上与男子们完全平等的生活，并逐渐建立了妇女自己的组织。目前仅据南昌、袁州、上饶三个分区不完全统计：已经组织起来的劳动妇女已有四万五千二百余人，上饶分区在二千二百多个保中，已有二千零二十九个保建立与发展了妇女组织。富有光荣革命传统的江西劳动妇女，在今后建设新中国的伟大事业中、在建设新的江西——新的幸福的家园中，必将发挥出更大的力量。【新华社】
