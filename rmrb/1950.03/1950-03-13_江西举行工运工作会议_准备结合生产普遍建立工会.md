Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 12th: The Jiangxi Provincial Labor Union Work Conference was held from the 22nd to the 28th of last month. The conference summarized the development of labor union work in various regions since October of last year and put forward work tasks for the next four months. Before October of last year, there was a serious tendency of closed-doorism in the province's labor union work. For example, the Nanchang City Labor Union did not develop a single member from June to the end of September of last year. The province's labor union work was also limited to a few large cities and industrial and mining areas such as Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Jingdezhen, and Pingxiang, and was not universally carried out throughout the province. After the provincial labor union work conference in October of last year discussed the national labor union work conference's work policy of "everyone running labor unions" and "basically organizing the province's working class in about a year," labor union work in various regions gradually began to develop. As of now, seven cities and thirty-seven counties in the province have established labor unions or labor union preparatory committees, developing more than 50,000 members. Major cities have universally opened employee training classes and worker night schools, training more than 3,700 worker cadres and activists. The general labor union preparatory committee also held a worker cadre school with more than 400 people in the middle of last month.

The main problem currently existing in Jiangxi Province's labor union work is that organizational work is still very slow. The more than 50,000 workers and staff members who have been organized in the province account for less than one-tenth of the total number of more than 700,000 employees in the province. Secondly, labor union work has not been closely integrated with production work. To this end, the conference put forward two specific requirements for the future labor union work in Jiangxi Province: First, before the "May Day" holiday this year, all major cities in the province must establish formal labor unions and develop membership to 50 percent of the total number of employees. The remaining counties, cities, districts, and towns that have not established labor unions must also organize labor unions before April and June of this year, respectively. Second, labor unions in all public and private enterprises should focus on developing production as their work center and should pay attention to running worker welfare undertakings while improving production.

### 江西举行工运工作会议  准备结合生产普遍建立工会

　　江西举行工运工作会议
    准备结合生产普遍建立工会
    【新华社南昌十二日电】江西省工运工作会议于上月二十二日至二十八日召开，会议总结了去年十月份以来各地工会工作的发展情况，并提出了今后四个月内的工作任务。去年十月以前，该省工会工作中曾存在着严重的关门主义偏向，如南昌市工会自去年六月至九月底，没有发展一个会员。全省工会工作也只限于南昌、九江、吉安、景德镇、萍乡等少数大城市和工矿区，没有在全省范围内普遍展开。去年十月全省工会工作会议讨论了全国工会工作会议关于“大家办工会”和“在一年左右把全省工人阶级基本上组织起来”的工作方针后，各地工会工作始逐步开展。截至目前为止，全省已有七个市和三十七个县成立了工会或工会筹委会，发展会员五万余人，各较大城市已普遍开办职工训练班和工人夜校，先后培养了三千七百多名工人干部和积极分子，总工会筹委会亦于上月中旬举办了四百多人的工人干部学校。
    江西省的工会工作目前存在的主要问题是组织工作进行仍很迟缓。全省现已组织起来的五万余工人职员，还不到全省职工总人数七十余万的十分之一。其次工会工作也还没有和生产工作密切结合起来。为此，会议对今后江西省的工会工作提出了两项具体要求：一、在今年“五一”节前，全省各主要城市要成立正式工会，发展会员到职工总数的百分之五十。其余未成立工会的县、市和区、镇，也要分别于今年四月和六月以前把工会组织起来。二、各公私营企业工会应以发展生产为工作中心，并应在提高生产中注意举办工人福利事业。
