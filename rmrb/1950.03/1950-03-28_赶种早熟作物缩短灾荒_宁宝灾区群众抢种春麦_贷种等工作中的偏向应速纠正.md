　　Rush to Plant Early-Maturing Crops to Shorten Famine
    Ningbao Disaster Area Masses Rush to Plant Spring Wheat
    Deviations in Seed Loans and Other Work Should Be Corrected Quickly
    [Our Newspaper Despatch] Reporter Li Wen reports: In order to rush to plant early-maturing crops and shorten the famine, the masses in the Ning (He) Bao (Di) disaster area of Hebei Province continue to rush to plant spring wheat. The Ningbao area has many rivers and low-lying land. The autumn flood last year was severe, and all autumn crops were submerged. Most areas did not plant winter wheat. In order to shorten the famine, before the spring wheat sowing season arrived, the Ning and Bao Disaster Relief Committees instructed all districts to prepare for spring planting, issue seed loans and food rations early, and earnestly resolve the specific difficulties of disaster victims in sowing spring wheat. When the spring sowing season arrived and the floodwaters had receded, the Disaster Relief Committee clearly put forward the slogan "Sow early, harvest early, connect early." It instructed that in non-flood-protected villages (i.e., villages not surrounded by concrete) or semi-flood-protected villages, efforts should be concentrated on rushing to plant spring wheat in conjunction with sideline production. It also universally convened representative meetings of village clusters and villages to conduct special discussions to promote this work. In the rushing-to-plant movement, village cadres and Communist Party members in many villages played a leading and organizing role for the masses. Zhao Tingshan and Liu Jiwang, Party members in Luxinzhuang, Seventh District of Baodi, knew that the weather was warm during the day and the ground was thawing, which was not suitable for sowing. Therefore, they led the masses to sow at night with lanterns, planting 200 mu of wheat in three nights. Zhang Fenglin, a Party member and cadre in Shuangzhuang, First District of Ninghe, first united four people to help each other plant 22 mu of wheat in one day. Under his influence and mobilization, the number of people joining in mutual aid planting increased to six groups the next day. Zhang Yunxiang, a female cadre in Xiaoqiezizhuang, Second District, delivered manure in the morning and pulled the plow to plant wheat in the afternoon, influencing 37 women to go to the fields to spread manure and pull the plow. Seeing this situation, all the men and women in the village went to the fields together, solving the difficulty of lacking animal power. Liu Fulin, a poor peasant in Liuzhuangzi, Sixth District, who is already 70 years old, saved food and clothing before planting wheat and exchanged his saved grain for seeds. With the government's loan assistance, he planted five mu of spring wheat. As of mid-March, according to statistics from seven districts including the first, third, and fifth districts of Ninghe, more than 85,000 mu of spring wheat had been sown. Currently, the disaster victims in the two counties are continuing to rush to plant under the slogan of "free up a piece of land and plant a piece of land."
    The following deviations have occurred in the sowing work in the Ningbao disaster area: First, the wheat seeds issued as loans were not strictly inspected in advance. The seeds were impure and of poor quality. Twenty to thirty percent of them failed to sprout after sowing, seriously harming the interests of the disaster victims. Second, a small number of district cadres (such as the cadres in the Eighth District of Baodi) did not recognize the urgent demand of the masses in the disaster area to sow early-maturing crops. They did not have a sufficient understanding of the seasonal nature of sowing, and they were afraid that the masses would eat the wheat seeds, so they issued the seeds late, which reduced the sown area in the entire district by several thousand mu. Third, when mobilizing labor mutual aid in some villages, they one-sidedly emphasized taking care of the widowed and orphaned households, allowing the mutual aid groups to cultivate land for the widowed and orphaned households without compensation, which affected the enthusiasm of the masses for production. These deviations have been discovered, some have been overcome, and some are being overcome.

　　赶种早熟作物缩短灾荒
    宁宝灾区群众抢种春麦
    贷种等工作中的偏向应速纠正
    【本报讯】记者力文报道：为赶种早熟作物，缩短灾荒，河北省宁（河）宝（坻）灾区群众继续抢种春麦。宁宝地区，河多地洼，去秋水灾严重，全部秋禾被水淹没，绝大部分地区未种上秋麦。为了缩短灾荒，宁、宝灾区委员会，在播种春麦季节到来前，即指示各区做好春种准备工作，早日发放种籽贷粮，认真解决灾民播种春麦中的具体困难。春播季节到来，水浆业已下撤，灾区委员会即明确提出“早种早收早接口”的口号。指示在非浐村（即不被水泥包围的村）或半浐村，应结合副业生产，集中力量抢种春麦，并普遍召开了一片村和村的代表会，进行了专门讨论，推动这一工作的进行。在抢种运动中，许多村庄的村干部、中共党员，起了带头和组织群众的作用。宝坻七区路新庄党员赵廷山、刘继旺知道白天气候暖地翻浆，不宜播种，便带领群众，打着灯笼，趁冻进行夜种，三夜种麦二百亩。宁河一区双庄党员干部张凤林首先团结四个人，一天互助种麦二十二亩，在他的影响和发动下，第二天插伙种麦者增至六个组。二区小茄子庄女干部张云香，午前送粪，午后拉耠子种麦，影响三十七个妇女下地撒粪拉耠子。全村男女看见这种情形，一齐下地，解决了缺乏畜力的困难。六区刘庄子贫农刘福林已七十岁了，种麦前省吃节用，把节省的粮食换成籽种，加上政府贷粮扶助，种上了五亩春麦。截止三月中旬，据宁河一三五等七个区统计，已播种春麦八万五千余亩。现两县灾民正在“脱出一块地种上一块地”的口号下，继续紧张抢种。
    宁宝灾区播种工作中曾发生以下偏向：一、对贷发的麦种，事前未进行严格检验，籽种不纯，质量太坏，播种后有百分之二十到三十不能出苗，严重损害了灾民利益；二、少数区干部（如宝坻八区的干部）未认识灾区群众播种早熟作物的迫切要求，对播种的季节性认识不足，怕群众吃掉麦种，束手束脚地晚发种籽，相差两天，使全区播种面积减少数千亩；三、部分村庄发动劳动互助时，片面强调照顾孤寡户，让互助组无代价地给孤寡户耕种，影响了群众生产积极性的发挥。这些偏向已被发现，有的已经克服，有的正在克服中。
