Xinhua News Agency, March 27th—The National Warehouse Material Inventory Committee of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government held its first plenary session on March 25th. The meeting stipulated that the period from May 16th to 31st would be the inventory period, and all relevant departments must complete preliminary clearing work before May 15th. Based on the experience gained from the inventory of material warehouses in the southern and northern railways from November of last year to February of this year, the meeting decided to strengthen pre-inventory publicity and education and preparation work, establish training classes for counting personnel, and organize the most experienced technicians and engineers to participate in the counting teams, so that investigation, registration, and valuation can be carried out simultaneously. The meeting unanimously agreed that mobilizing cadres at all levels to actively participate in the counting work and creating a widespread and enthusiastic material counting campaign is an important condition for ensuring the smooth completion of the counting work. Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out at the meeting that the main purpose of inventorying warehouse materials is to solve the problem of material supply, and the focus should be on sorting materials, handling dead stock and waste materials, and the principle should be to avoid freezing materials and hindering normal production. On the one hand, we should distinguish between consumables, spare parts, finished products, semi-finished products, repairable waste materials, and dead stock, etc.; on the other hand, we should find ways to ensure that materials can still be collected at any time while clearing the warehouse.

　　铁道部全国仓库物资清查委员会首次全会
    决定掀起清查物资运动
    滕部长指出清查目的在于解决材料供应
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府铁道部全国仓库物资清查委员会已于三月二十五日举行第一次全体委员会议。会议规定五月十六日至三十一日为进行清查期间，五月十五日以前各有关部门必须完成初步清理工作。会议并根据去年十一月至今年二月间清查南方、北方铁路材料仓库的经验，确定加强事前宣传教育和准备工作，成立清点人员训练班，组织最有经验的技术人员、工程师参加清点工作队，以便调查、登记、估价同时进行。会议一致认为：动员各级干部积极参加清点工作，造成普遍热烈的清点材料运动，是保证清点工作顺利完成的重要条件。滕代远部长在会上指出：清点仓库物资的主要目的在于解决材料供应问题，重点应放在整理材料，处理呆料和废料，并应以避免冻结材料和妨害正常生产为原则。一方面分清消耗品、备品、成品、半成品、可修用的废料、呆料等，一方面设法在清理仓库的同时，仍可随时具领材料。
