　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th. The National Forestry Business Conference convened in Beijing by the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government, lasting ten days, concluded on the 9th.
    Minister Liang Xi delivered a report at the meeting on the current forestry situation in China and the specific work plan for this year. Minister Liang pointed out in his report that China's forest area accounts for only five percent of the land area (according to Soviet experience, it should be thirty percent to avoid natural disasters), thus frequent floods and sandstorms occur. More seriously, in most areas, the destruction and indiscriminate logging of forests has not yet stopped. At the same time, the current timber reserves are far from enough to meet the urgent needs. Therefore, Minister Liang pointed out that the current forestry work policy should focus on universal forest protection as the main task, while selecting key areas for planned afforestation. The specific work plan for this year is: (1) Understanding the situation and implementing key surveys; (2) Closing hillsides for afforestation on 4.5 million mu; (3) Collecting 3.6 million jin of seeds; (4) Cultivating 470 million seedlings; (5) Afforesting more than 1.15 million mu; (6) Planting 400 million trees; (7) Logging 3.88 million cubic meters of timber; (8) Preparing to develop forest resources in the Greater Khingan Mountains. In his report, Minister Liang also provided clear opinions on issues such as forest rights, rewards for afforestation on barren mountains and land, forest protection and logging, forestry organization structure and leadership relations, and cadre training.
    Vice Minister Li Fanwu called on everyone in his closing speech to rely on the masses and to combine national interests with the interests of the masses; he asked leaders at all levels to give appropriate importance to forestry work, and to study hard and improve their work.

　　全国林业业务会议闭幕
    梁希指示当前工作方针：普遍护林，重点造林。
    【新华社北京十一日电】中央人民政府林垦部在京召开的全国林业业务会议，历时十天，已于九日闭幕。
    梁希部长在会上做了关于目前我国林业情况和今年具体工作计划的报告。梁部长在报告中指出：我国森林面积只占土地面积百分之五（据苏联的经验，要百分之三十才能免除天灾），因此经常发生水患的灾害和风沙。而更严重的情况是：大部地区至今还没有停止破坏和滥伐森林的行动。同时目前的木材蓄积量远不够供应当前急迫的需要。因此，梁部长指出：当前的林业工作方针，应以普遍护林为主要任务，同时选择重点有计划地进行造林。今年具体工作计划是：（一）了解情况，实行重点调查；（二）封山育林四百五十万亩；（三）采种三百六十万斤；（四）育苗四亿七千万株；（五）造林一百一十五万多亩；（六）植树四亿株；（七）采伐木材三百八十八万立方米；（八）筹备开发大兴安岭森林资源。梁部长在报告中对林权问题、奖励荒山荒地造林，护林伐木、林业组织机构及领导关系和干部训练等问题，都提供了明确的意见。
    李范五副部长在闭幕词中号召大家要依靠群众，要把国家利益与群众利益结合起来；要求各级领导干部对林业工作有适当重视，并努力学习，改进工作。
