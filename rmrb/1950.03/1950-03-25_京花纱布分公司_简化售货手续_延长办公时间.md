　　Beijing Floral Cotton Cloth Branch
    Simplify Sales Procedures and Extend Office Hours
    [This newspaper's dispatch] To meet the needs of citizens and organizations for spring clothing, the Beijing Floral Cotton Cloth Branch's stores have decided to extend business hours from the previous 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily to 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM. It is further stipulated that Sunday business will continue as usual in March. The sales method has also been changed to limit white cloth to five bolts or less, with no limit on colored cloth. For those with genuinely large needs, they can negotiate in person and solutions will be provided as appropriate. At the same time, procedures have been simplified compared to before. Those purchasing five bolts of cloth or less can pay and pick up the goods at the time. Those purchasing more than five bolts can first pay at the People's Bank and pick up the goods with the receipt, to achieve a large supply for the entire city.
    The Beijing Yarn and Cloth Exchange has also changed to allowing customers to enter and purchase goods at will, with no quantity restrictions, to universally supply the needs of citizens.
