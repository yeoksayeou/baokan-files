　　Implement Teaching Guidelines Combining Industrial Construction
    Beijing-Tianjin Universities Reform Science and Engineering Courses
    Preliminary Draft Revised and Distributed to Relevant Parties for Discussion
    [Our Newspaper] (Reporter Jin Feng) Report: Since liberation, the courses of various departments in science and engineering colleges of universities across the country have largely remained unchanged. As a result of the old education policies, there are still many unreasonable aspects of science and engineering courses. The most important is that the teaching objectives of each department are not clear, the curriculum is disconnected from industrial construction, and the content is too empty, abstract, and complicated, which seriously affects learning outcomes and students' health. Therefore, in the last semester, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government issued a call to streamline science and engineering courses. Universities in Northeast, North China, and even East China generally streamlined their courses, temporarily resolving some learning difficulties. However, due to the lack of thorough planning and unified pace during the streamlining process in each school, most only achieved "simplification" without "refinement." At the beginning of March this year, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government invited some professors from science and engineering colleges of universities in Beijing and Tianjin to hold a forum, which determined the principles, steps, and specific methods for curriculum reform. First, eight curriculum reform groups were established for the main departments of science and engineering colleges, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and chemical engineering. Conveners were appointed for each group. It was stipulated that the conveners should sort out the preliminary draft of the curriculum reform based on the materials provided by each school in mid-March, convene the curriculum reform group to discuss and revise it, and send it to relevant agencies and schools for discussion. The curriculum reform group would then create a second draft based on this, distribute it to various agencies and schools for discussion again, and finally revise it into a curriculum reform draft to be submitted to the Ministry of Education. The aforementioned work was stipulated to be completed before the end of April.

    Currently, teachers and students in relevant departments of each school have discussed and solicited preliminary opinions from relevant agencies, and submitted various proposals to the conveners of each group to sort out into preliminary drafts. Each curriculum reform group held a discussion meeting simultaneously on March 19th and completed the revision of the preliminary draft. In the curriculum reform drafts of the eight academic departments, the teaching tasks of each department were determined, and the names of the required public courses, required departmental courses, required group courses, and elective courses were detailed. The content and weekly study hours (some even specify the hours for lectures, experiments, and self-study) were included, and most stipulated that students' weekly study hours should not exceed sixty hours. The curriculum reform drafts of each department mostly proposed strengthening internships to comply with the teaching guidelines of combining science and engineering curriculum with production and construction. In order to adapt to the national industrial construction strategy of regional division of labor and prioritized development, the drafts also mostly pointed out that each school department should select one or two key areas for development, or adopt group study methods.

    Currently, the preliminary drafts of curriculum reform for each department have been distributed to relevant business departments, such as the Financial and Economic Committee, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and universities across the country that have these departments, to widely solicit opinions and organize discussions.

　　实现结合工业建设的教学方针
    京津大学改革理工课程
    初步草案修订完毕分送有关方面讨论
    【本报讯】记者金凤报道：解放以来，各地大学理工学院各系课程大多维持原状。而由于旧教育方针实施结果，理工学院课程不合理之处仍然甚多，最主要者为各系教学方针任务不明确，课程教学与工业建设脱节，内容尤多失之过于空洞抽象，繁杂，严重影响了学习效果及学生健康。因而上学期中央人民政府教育部即提出精简理工学院课程的号召，东北、华北以至华东各地大学的理工学院，普遍进行了精简课程，暂时解决了一部分学习上的困难。但由于各校进行精简时缺少周密的计划和统一的步调，大多数只做到了“简”而不“精”。今年三月初，中央人民政府教育部即邀请了京津各大学理工学院一部分教授举行座谈，确定了课程改革的原则、步骤和具体办法。首先就理工学院的主要科系成立了数学、物理、化学、地质、电机、机械、土木、化工等八个课改小组，推定了各组的召集人。并规定召集人须于三月中旬根据各校供给的资料整理出课改的初步草案，召开课改小组讨论修正，送有关机关及各校讨论，课改小组据此作成第二草案，再分送各机关学校讨论，最后修正为课改草案提交教育部。上述工作规定于四月底前完成。
    现各校有关各系师生已讨论并征求了有关机关的初步意见，提出了各种提案，送交各组召集人整理为初步草搞。各课改小组已于三月十九日同时举行讨论会，修改完成了初步草案。八个学系的课改草案中，确定了各该系的教学任务，详细载明了公共必修、系必修、分组必修及选修课的名称。内容及每星期学习时数（有的更分别说明上课、实验及自学时数），大多数并规定了学生每周学习时数不超过六十小时。各系课改草案中，大多提出加强实习，以求符合于理工学院课程教学结合生产建设的教学方针。为了适应工业建设在全国范围内采取地区分工，有重点发展的办法，草案中又多指出各校系应择定一、二重点发展，或采取分组学习办法。
    现各系课程改革的初步草案已分送各有关业务部门，如财经委员会、重工业部、燃料部、交通部、铁道部、水利部、中国科学院等机关及全国设有该系的大学广泛征求意见，组织讨论中。
