　　"Learning to Manage Enterprises" Must Be Integrated with Reality
    Datong Mining Bureau Inspects Waste
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Management cadres of various mines and factories under the Datong Mining Bureau studied the People's Daily editorial "Learning to Manage Enterprises," and in connection with their actual work, conducted inspections and reflections, discovering that there were still considerably serious phenomena of waste in the various mines and factories. Based only on the inspection of eight projects, the waste of manpower and materials was equivalent to 84,000 catties of millet. The reasons for the waste were mainly the "large-scale operation" mentality existing among some management cadres, and technical empiricism, lacking a meticulous work attitude. For example, individual leading cadres of the machine factory only liked to talk about expanding the factory's plans, without paying attention to studying the elimination of unreasonable phenomena in production. According to January statistics: the factory should have had 7,908 workdays, but the actual attendance rate was only 64.4 percent, wasting 4,050 catties of millet, calculated at 15 catties per workday. The material warehouse used a lot of pine wood transported from afar to make unimportant boxes and cabinets, of which 2,600 cubic feet were issued to the general affairs section alone, while there was no pine wood when it was needed for projects that absolutely required it. The Dongda Alley tunneling project of the Tongjialiang Mine was not accurately calculated, and the alley was curved and not straight. Although it was discovered later, it was not corrected in time. As a result, the slope was too steep, and another 60 meters of roof had to be picked again, wasting 3,300 catties of millet. The Yongdingzhuang Mine's ditch repair was poorly planned, wasting 17,576 catties of millet. The installation of aerial ropeway budgeted 75 bags of cement, but only 8 bags were actually needed. To this end, the Datong Mining Bureau plans to summarize preliminary learning experience, use actual materials as educational content, and arrange for the entire mine to study the "February 7th" editorial, creating a movement to improve production efficiency and oppose corruption and waste.

　　“学会管理企业”要结合实际
    大同矿务局检查浪费
    【本报讯】大同矿务局所属各矿厂管理干部学习人民日报“学会管理企业”社论，并联系实际工作进行检查和反省，发现各矿厂仍然存在相当严重的浪费现象。仅据八项工程的检查，即浪费人力与物资折合小米八万四千斤。造成浪费的原因：主要是在某些管理干部中，存在着“大摊铺作”的思想，和技术上的经验主义，缺乏精打细算的工作态度。如机器厂的个别领导干部，只喜欢高谈扩大工厂的计划，而不注意研究消灭生产中的不合理现象。据一月份统计：该厂应出勤工为七千九百零八个，实际出勤率仅占百分之六四·四，每工以十五斤计，浪费小米四千零五十斤。材料库把很多从远方运来的松木，作了不关重要的箱柜，其中发给总务科就达二千六百方，而到非用松木不可的工程时，则没有了松木。同家梁矿东大巷掘进工程，没有经过精密计算，巷道弯曲不直，后虽已发现，而未及时纠正，结果坡度太大，又重新挑顶六十米，浪费小米三千三百斤。永定庄矿修水沟，计划不周，浪费小米一万七千五百七十六斤。按装高车预算洋灰七十五袋，实际用八袋就够了。为此，大同矿务局，计划总结初步学习经验，以实际材料为教育内容，布置全矿学习“二七”社论，造成提高生产效率，反对贪污浪费的运动。
