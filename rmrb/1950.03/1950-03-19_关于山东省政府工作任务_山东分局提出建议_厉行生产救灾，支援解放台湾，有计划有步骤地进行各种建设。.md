Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th: Fu Qiutao, Deputy Secretary of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee, presented suggestions to the first Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference on the work tasks of the Shandong Provincial People's Government on behalf of the Shandong Branch.

He first succinctly outlined the future work tasks of the Shandong Provincial Government, saying: "According to the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the instructions of the East China Military and Political Committee on work tasks, and the specific conditions of our province, our work tasks are: to mobilize and organize the strength of the people of the province, vigorously implement production and economy, provide disaster relief and prepare for famine, overcome current financial difficulties, continue to support the East China Front, assist the main forces in liberating Taiwan, and eliminate the remaining enemy forces; and, based on needs and possibilities, to continue to carry out various political, economic, cultural, and military constructions in a planned and step-by-step manner; in all these construction works, economic construction should be the central task; we should unswervingly focus on cities and actively carry out industrial construction, but at present, we must first overcome disasters, complete land reform, and restore and develop agricultural production."

Subsequently, he put forward suggestions on specific work tasks related to disaster relief and famine preparedness, land reform, economic recovery and development (including agriculture, industry, commerce, cooperatives, finance, transportation, fisheries, salt industry, finance, etc.), cultural, educational, and health construction, military construction, and democratic construction.

Regarding disaster relief and famine preparedness, governments at all levels must, in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, make the implementation of production for disaster relief the primary task at present. In all disaster areas, it is necessary to vigorously organize the masses to carry out production for disaster relief movements, doing everything possible to prevent starvation, abandonment of land, and reduction of livestock, and requiring the cessation of fleeing from famine. In non-disaster areas, attention should be paid to organizing the masses to save and prepare for famine through the restoration and development of production. The guiding principle for disaster relief should be based on self-reliance through production and mutual assistance among the people, combined with government assistance; emphasis should be placed on overcoming disasters through the restoration and development of production.

Regarding land reform: Although land reform has been carried out in about 72 percent of the areas in Shandong Province, there are still many outstanding cases in these areas that need to be dealt with, and about 28 percent of the areas have not yet carried out land reform. Therefore, it is necessary to combine production for disaster relief and strive to complete the task of land reform throughout the province this year.

Regarding economic recovery and development: The agricultural production policy should focus on recovery. In old areas, it is required to improve the production level by one step compared with last year. In areas with better conditions, strive to increase it by 10 percent. New areas are required to maintain the existing production level, and areas with better conditions are required to increase it slightly. Disaster areas are required to overcome disasters and lay the foundation for production. The central tasks of agricultural production this year are to increase grain production and expand the cotton planting area. In terms of industry, in accordance with the unified plan of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, on the existing basis, we should continue to restore, consolidate, transform, and improve them in a planned, step-by-step, and differentiated manner. Special attention should be paid to restoring and developing heavy industries such as coal mines and electric power, but at the same time, we must restore and develop all light industries and handicrafts that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood as much as possible.

Regarding military construction: We should continue to strengthen the work of supporting the front and cooperate with the main forces to completely eliminate the remaining enemies and strive to complete the liberation of Taiwan. At the same time, we should strengthen coastal defense construction.

Regarding democratic construction: People's representative conferences have been generally convened in various cities and counties in Shandong. In the future, we must, in accordance with the organizational regulations for people's representative conferences at the city and county levels promulgated by the Central People's Government, hold meetings on schedule to discuss and promote work, and improve the people's democratic government organs at all levels; once land reform is thoroughly realized and the local people are fully organized, general elections should be held immediately to convene the local people's congresses.

　　关于山东省政府工作任务
    山东分局提出建议
    厉行生产救灾，支援解放台湾，有计划有步骤地进行各种建设。
    【新华社济南十七日电】中共中央山东分局副书记傅秋涛，代表山东分局向山东省首届各界人民代表会议提出关于山东省人民政府工作任务的建议。
    他首先扼要地提出今后山东省政府的工作任务说：根据中国人民政协共同纲领与华东军政委员会关于工作任务的各项指示及本省的具体情况，我们的工作任务是：动员与组织全省人民的力量，厉行生产节约，救灾备荒，克服当前的财政困难，继续支援华东前线，协助主力部队解放台湾，肃清敌人残余势力；并依据着需要与可能，有计划、有步骤地继续进行各种政治的、经济的、文化的、军事的建设；在所有这些建设工作中，又应以经济建设为中心；既应坚定不移地以城市为重点，积极地进行工业建设，但在目前又必须首先战胜灾荒，完成土地改革，恢复和发展农业生产。
    接着，他提出了关于救灾备荒、土地改革、恢复与发展经济（包括农业、工业、商业、合作社、金融、交通运输、渔盐业、财政等方面）、文化教育卫生建设、军事建设、民主建设等项具体工作任务的建议。
    关于救灾备荒，各级政府必须根据中央人民政府及华东军政委员会的指示，把贯彻生产救灾当为当前的首要任务。在一切灾区要大力组织群众进行生产救灾运动，尽一切可能做到不饿死人、不荒地、不减少牲口，并要求达到停止逃荒。在非灾区要从恢复与发展生产中注意组织群众节约备荒。救灾的方针应以生产自救、社会互济为主，结合政府协助；强调从恢复与发展生产中来克服灾荒。
    关于土地改革：山东全省已进行土地改革地区虽达百分之七十二左右，但这些地区还有许多悬案需要继续处理，而未进行土地改革的地区尚有百分之二十八左右。为此，必须结合生产救灾，争取于今年内在全省完成土地改革的任务。
    关于恢复与发展经济：农业生产方针应以恢复为主，在老区要求比去年生产水平提高一步，条件较好地区争取提高一成；新区要求保持现有生产水平，条件较好地区争取略加提高；灾区要求克服灾荒，奠定生产基础。今年农业生产的中心任务是增产粮食与扩大植棉面积。工业方面，应根据中央人民政府及华东军政委员会的统一计划，在现有基础上，有计划、有步骤、有分别地继续加以恢复、整理、改造与提高，特别要注意恢复与发展煤矿、电力等重工业，但同时又必须尽可能地恢复与发展一切有益于国计民生的轻工业以及手工业。
    关于军事建设：应继续加强支援前线工作，配合主力兵团彻底肃清残余敌人，为完成解放台湾而斗争。同时，应加强海防建设。
    关于民主建设：山东各市、县业已普遍召开过各界人民代表会议；今后必须根据中央人民政府颁布的市、县各界人民代表会议组织通则，按期开会讨论与推动工作，健全各级人民民主政权机构；一俟土地改革彻底实现，当地人民已有充分组织时，应即实行普选，召开当地人民代表大会。
