Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th. The first National Electricity Conference convened by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government concluded successfully on the 2nd, after twelve days. At the meeting, the representatives from various regions unanimously agreed with the basic principles for the national electricity work in 1950 proposed by Minister Chen Yu in his report: to ensure safe power transmission throughout the year, and to prepare for key construction of power supply equipment required for industrial production in the next two to three years. The meeting finally adopted the following resolutions as the goals for this year:

	I. Overhaul Work: It is essential to strictly criticize the erroneous and outdated thinking of ensuring safe power transmission by increasing equipment and reducing output. It must be recognized that only by thoroughly implementing planned periodic overhauls can we guarantee safe power transmission and restore equipment effectiveness. Therefore, this year, each region should organize unified overhaul organizations to concentrate the use of manpower and resources in the entire region, complete 100% of the overhaul tasks for machines, boilers, lines, and other equipment this year, and improve the output of existing equipment to the level required for this year's production.

	II. Production Work: (1) This year, the national power generation must increase by 20.3% compared to last year, the standard coal consumption should be reduced by 11.8%, the in-plant power consumption should be reduced by 19%, and the line loss should be reduced by 24.2%, in order to achieve the goal of saving 107 million catties of millet. (2) The utilization rate of equipment this year must be increased by 20.8% compared to last year. Therefore, a strict electricity management system must be established. Local power plants should sign contracts with local factories and mines according to their actual needs, stipulating the time and quantity of electricity consumption, and implement a preparation fee system. (3) All factories should reform the old production organization, implement strict division management and a dedicated person responsible system, and should formulate unified technical and management regulations.

	III. Basic Construction: This year's construction task is to prepare for the electricity required for industrial production development in the next two to three years. However, the state's finances are still in difficulty, so only key construction can be carried out. In addition, it is necessary to overcome egalitarianism and departmentalism, and transfer a portion of generators to areas lacking industrial power.

	IV. Security Work: Last year, power plants and transmission lines in various places were repeatedly subjected to serious organized and planned sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, raising political vigilance to more closely protect the people's power plants is a major political task for electricity workers. All localities must formulate specific security measures and strictly implement them.

In addition, the conference also made specific regulations on cultivating and using engineering cadres, strengthening employee education, and unifying organizational leadership.

The conference reviewed typical reports from various regions and selected Xiaofengman, Qingdao, Tianjin, Tangshan, Qishuyan, Nanjing and other power plants with achievements in five categories: safe power generation, democratic reform, overhaul creation, saving coal consumption, and anti-bombing, and suggested that the Ministry of Fuel Industry give awards.

In his concluding report at the closing meeting, Minister Chen explained the conference resolutions. He emphasized that the various quotas and standards set by the conference are very low. Our equipment utilization rate is only about 40% of the Soviet standard, and what we are going to save this year is only 107 million catties of millet. Therefore, it is not enough to complete the task this year. We must mobilize all employees to strive to exceed the task!

　　全国电业会议确定今年奋斗目标
    保证全年安全发送电并准备重点建设两三年内工业所需电力
    【新华社北京四日电】中央人民政府燃料工业部所召开的第一次全国电业会议历时十二天，已于二日圆满闭幕。会上，各地代表一致同意陈郁部长在他的报告中所提出的一九五○年全国电业工作的基本方针：即保证全年安全发送电，并准备有重点地建设两三年内工业生产所需的电源设备。会议最后通过了以下数项决议，作为今年的奋斗目标：
    一、检修工作：必须严格批判以增加设备及减少出力来保证安全发送电的错误的陈旧思想，必须确认只有彻底实行有计划的定期检修，才是保证安全发送电和恢复设备效能的最基本方法。因此今年各地区应分别组织统一的检修机构，以集中使用全区的人力物力，百分之百地完成本年度机器、锅炉、线路等设备的检修任务，使现有设备的出力提高到今年生产所需要的水准。
    二、生产工作：（１）今年全国发电量须较去年增加百分之二○·三，标准煤耗应减低百分之一一·八，厂内自用电应减少百分之一九，线路损失应减少百分之二四·二，以达到节省小米一亿零七百万斤的目标。（２）今年设备的利用率须较去年提高百分之二○·八。因此就必须建立严格的用电管理制度。各地电厂应与当地厂矿用户按其实际需要订立合同，规定用电时间和数量，并实行收取准备费制度。（３）各厂应改革旧有的生产组织，实行严格的分场管理与专人负责制，并应订出统一的技术与管理规章。
    三、基本建设：今年的建设任务是准备今后两三年内工业生产发展所需的电力。但目前国家财政尚有困难，故只能作重点建设。此外，必须克服平均主义和本位主义思想，抽调一部分发电机到缺乏工业用电的地区去。
    四、保卫工作：去年各地发电厂及送电线路屡次遭受反革命分子有组织有计划的严重破坏，因此提高政治警惕性以更严密地保卫人民电厂是电业职工当前的重大政治任务，各地必须订出具体的保卫办法严格执行。
    此外，会议在培养与使用工程干部、加强职工教育和统一组织领导等方面亦均分别作了具体规定。
    会议曾审查了各地的典型报告，并按安全发电、民主改革、检修创造、节省煤耗及反轰炸等五类分别选出小丰满、青岛、天津、唐山及戚墅堰、南京等有成绩的电厂，建议燃料工业部给予奖励。
    闭幕会议上陈部长作总结报告时曾对会议决议加以说明，他强调称：会议规定的各种定额标准是很低的，我们的设备利用率还只及苏联标准的百分之四十左右，我们今年所要节省的只有一亿零七百万斤小米，因此今年只完成任务是不够的，我们必须动员全体职工为超过任务而努力！
