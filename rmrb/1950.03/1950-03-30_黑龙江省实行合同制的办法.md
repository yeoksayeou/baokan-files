　　Measures for Implementing the Contract System in Heilongjiang Province
(1) Make thorough preparations before signing a contract: First, conduct in-depth investigations and research to understand the types, output, quality, technical conditions, and transportation conditions of local sideline production, the source of raw materials, whether the state purchases them, whether they have export value, and the sales situation in local and foreign markets. Second, conduct precise cost accounting to understand the cost prices of various sideline products and the prices farmers hope for, local and foreign market prices, and state purchase prices, plus transportation, loss reduction, and personnel expenses. This is an important link in signing and implementing contracts. However, we must prevent cooperative cadres from having the bias of "not doing anything without profit," and mainly consider whether it is beneficial to the country, the people, and the development of production. Otherwise, if contracts are signed blindly without cost accounting, either the cooperative will lose money or the farmers will suffer. For example, the Suihua County Federation of Cooperatives signed a contract with the bank to purchase 300,000 jin of wheat seeds and was responsible for storing them until the spring plowing to distribute agricultural loans, with a handling fee of 50 yuan per jin. However, after calculating the personnel expenses for purchasing, the cost of storage tools and mats, and the weight loss in winter, they would lose hundreds of millions of yuan. Third, before signing a contract, we must understand the situation of both the producer and the purchaser, whether the producer has prepared raw materials, has the production capacity, can deliver the goods on time, and guarantee a certain quality, and whether the purchasing party can supply the payment in time, otherwise it will affect the credit of the cooperative and the turnover of funds. For example, the Suihua County Federation of Cooperatives signed a contract with a flour mill to purchase wheat, but because the flour mill could not supply cash, the county federation of cooperatives had to advance 2.4 billion yuan, and the flour mill only returned it after more than a month, which caused the cooperative to suffer a great loss.
(2) The content of the contract should include the quantity, quality, price, delivery and payment time (in installments), method, and location of the sideline products to be purchased and sold, as well as the preferential rate for the cooperative, and the method of being responsible for loss reduction, etc. At the same time, it should be clearly stipulated that there should be certain compensation fees and late fees for untimely payment and delivery, so that both parties signing the contract will abide by their promises. Regarding the price and quality of the products, depending on the specific situation, they can be divided into two types: "flexible contracts" and "fixed contracts." A "flexible contract" means that the price is based on the quality grade of the goods at the time of delivery and follows the market price. A "fixed contract" means a certain quality and a certain price. The contract price signed with state-owned stores sometimes adopts the principle of rising but not falling, so that the cooperative does not suffer losses. In order to prevent both parties from suffering losses in price, it is generally better to sign short-term contracts. A method of paying in installments and delivering goods in installments should be set. Generally, when signing purchase and sales contracts with the state and farmers, half or one-third of the price should be paid upon signing, and all payments should be made after more than half of the goods have been delivered. Do not pay all the payments upon signing the contract, as this is very beneficial to supporting farmers' sideline production and cooperatives. Both parties should carefully consider before signing the contract, and once signed, they should abide by their promises and ensure the quality stipulated in the contract, and should not cut corners. We oppose the bias of cooperatives (or lower-level cooperatives) attempting to take advantage of state-owned stores (or higher-level cooperatives), using state funds for speculation and profiteering, failing to fulfill contracts, and failing to deliver goods on time.
(3) The method of signing contracts and the issues that should be paid attention to: First, the contract should preferably be a linked purchase and sales contract from state-owned stores to counties, districts, villages, and production teams and households. County and district federations of cooperatives and state-owned stores can sign from top to bottom after investigation and research, but villages and districts and the masses must sign from bottom to top based on the production and sales situation of the masses, first with the masses and production teams, and then with the district cooperative to sign purchase and sales contracts, otherwise it will become an administrative order and an assigned task. Moreover, contracts can only be signed through economic organizations, based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and cannot be forced. It is wrong for county federations of cooperatives to sign purchase and sales contracts with district and village administrative cadres, as this will inevitably lead to administrative assignments. Second, the key to widely developing contract signing and implementation lies in villages, teams and production groups. If the village or team has not signed a contract with the group and farm households, everything is empty. Villages and teams must combine the signing of purchase and sales contracts with the organization of sideline occupations. Cooperatives should cooperate with district and village cadres to grasp typical examples to promote the overall situation. Therefore, the size of the contract should be determined according to the situation. Secondly, it is necessary to prevent villages and teams from failing to go deep into the masses to organize sideline production after signing contracts with district and county teams, and treating the advance payments of the contract as "loans," "relief," or speculation and profiteering. Third, after signing the contract, cadres of county, district, village, and team must go deep down to closely check and urge, understand the production situation, and ensure timely delivery of goods. They cannot think that everything is fine after signing the contract. Those who cannot guarantee production, such as hooligans, should not be contracted with.

### 黑龙江省实行合同制的办法

　　黑龙江省实行合同制的办法
    （一）在订合同之前要做好充分的准备工作：第一、要进行深入的调查研究，了解当地副业生产种类、产量、质量、技术条件、运输条件，原料来源，国家是否收购，是否有出口价值，本地和外地市场销售情况。第二、精密进行成本核算，了解各种副业产品的成本价格和农民希望的价格，本地外地市场价格，国家收购价格，再加运输、损耗减量、人员开支等，这是订立和实现合同的重要环节。但这中间要防止合作社干部“无利不干”的偏向，主要应看对国家对人民对发展生产是否有利，否则如无成本核算盲目的订合同，不是合作社赔本就是农民吃亏。如绥化县联社与银行订立合同，代购麦种三十万斤，负责保管到春耕发放农贷时，每斤手续费五十元，但事后计算收购时人员开支保管工具席子费用，一冬的减量即要赔本上亿元。第三、订合同前必须了解产购双方情况，生产者原料准备，生产能力，是否能按时交货，保证一定质量，收购方面货款是否能供应及时，否则即会影响合作社的信用和资金周转。如绥化县联社与火磨订代购小麦合同，由于火磨现款供应不上，结果县联社垫压了资金二十四亿，火磨一个多月才还上，合作社吃了很大的亏。
    （二）关于合同内容，应包括购销副业产品的数量、质量、价格、交货付款（或农民需要的实物）的时间（分几期），办法，地点，及对合作社的优待比率，及减量损耗负责办法等，同时应明确规定货款及交付不及时要有一定的赔偿费和延迟费，使签定合同双方互守信用。关于产品的价格和质量按具体情况，可分为“活口合同”与“死口合同”两种，“活口合同”即按交货时货物的质量等级作价随行就市，“死口合同”即一定质量一定价格，与国家商店订立合同价格，有的采取随涨不随落，不使合作社吃亏。为了使双方在价格上不吃亏，一般以订立短期合同较好。定出分期付款给价，分期交货办法，一般与国家和农民订购销合同，一签字先交定价一半或三分之一，交货一半以上即全部给价付款，不要一签定合同即全部给价付款，这对扶助农民副业生产与合作社好处很大。在签定合同前双方应慎重考虑，一经签字即应互守信用，保证合同上规定的质量，不能偷工减料。反对合作社（或下级合作社）企图占国家商店（或上级合作社）便宜，利用国家资金投机倒把从中渔利，不履行合同，不按时交货的偏向。
    （三）订合同的方法和应注意的问题：第一、合同最好是从国家商店县、区、村社到生产小组和户，订立联系购销合同。县区联社和国家商店可经过调查研究自上而下订立，但村社和区社与群众即必须自下而上根据群众产销情况，首先与群众和生产小组订，然后再与区社订购销合同，否则就会变成行政命令和摊派任务。而且订合同只能是通过经济组织，本自愿两利原则，不能勉强订。县联社与区村行政干部订购销合同是不对的，他必然形成行政摊派。第二、广泛开展订合同和实现合同的关键在村社和生产小组，如村社没有和小组、农户订合同，一切都是空的。村社必须把订立购销合同与组织副业结合起来，合作社应与区村干部配合起来，抓住典型推动全面，因此合同的大小均应根据情况决定。其次要防止村社与区县社订合同后，不深入群众组织副业生产，把合同预支的定款作为“贷款”“救济”或投机倒把。第三、订合同后县区村社干部必须深入下去抓紧检查督促，了解其生产情况，保证按期交货，不能认为订了合同即万事大吉。对生产无保证的，如二流子即不与他订。
