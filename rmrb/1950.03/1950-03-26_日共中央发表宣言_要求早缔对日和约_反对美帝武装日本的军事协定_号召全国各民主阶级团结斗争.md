The declaration firmly opposes any military agreement that turns Japan into a military base and drives the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder. It also demands the immediate withdrawal of the occupation forces after the conclusion of the peace treaty.

　　In its declaration, the Japanese Communist Party denounced the reactionary Yoshida government for "serving foreign imperialism." The declaration called on all democratic classes who hope for the independence of the Japanese nation to unite and form a people's front to fight together.
