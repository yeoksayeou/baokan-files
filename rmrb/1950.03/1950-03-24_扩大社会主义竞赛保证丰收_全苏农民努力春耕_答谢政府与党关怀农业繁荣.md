　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th: The Soviet Union's collective farmers enthusiastically support the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party regarding spring plowing. Collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms in Ukraine have also held mass rallies, assuring Stalin that they will carry out spring sowing in an exemplary manner and strive to cultivate for a bumper harvest. Maltyanov, chairman of the famous "Chapayev" collective farm in Voronezh Oblast, stated: The government and the Party's decision is our fighting program. News from Novorossiysk, Rostov, Smolensk, Kuban, Uzbekistan and other places stated: Collective farmers and workers of state farms and machine and tractor stations unanimously believe that the decision expresses the government and the Party's new concern for agricultural prosperity. Farmers across the country have proposed expanding socialist competition to ensure a bumper harvest in 1950.
    The Labor Daily editorial pointed out: The great socialist competition movement that flourished in the Soviet countryside during the Supreme Soviet election campaign is continuing to expand. Trade union organizations must support and develop this mass competition, provide specific guidance adapted to local conditions, and establish thorough mass management in all aspects of preparing for spring sowing.

    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联各地集体农民热烈地拥护苏联部长会议和联共中央关于春耕的决定。乌克兰的集体农场、机器与拖拉机站和国营农场并纷纷举行群众大会，向斯大林保证以模范的方式进行春播，保证努力耕耘以期丰收。佛罗内州著名的“夏伯阳”集体农场主席马尔特雅诺夫称：政府和党的决定便是我们工作的战斗纲领。来自诺佛罗西斯克、罗斯托夫、斯摩棱斯克、库班、乌兹贝克斯坦等地的消息称：集体农民和国营农场及机器与拖拉机站的工人，一致认为决定表示了政府和党对于农业繁荣的新的关怀。全国农民都提出了扩大的社会主义竞赛，保证一九五零年丰收。
    劳动报社论指出：苏联农村在最高苏维埃选举运动中蓬勃开展了的巨大的社会主义竞赛运动，仍在继续扩展着。工会组织必须支持并发展这种群众性的竞赛，提供具体的、适应各地情况的指导，而且在筹备春播的各方面建立周密的群众管理。
