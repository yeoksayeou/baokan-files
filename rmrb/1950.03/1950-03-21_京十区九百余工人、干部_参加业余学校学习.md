　　Over 900 Workers and Cadres in Beijing's Tenth District Participate in Spare-Time School Studies
    [Reported by this newspaper] The opening ceremony of the workers and cadres spare-time school in Beijing's Tenth District was officially held on the 17th. Since the resolution of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference to develop spare-time schools, the district has been actively preparing for this work since the beginning of March. This time, 846 students participated in the placement exams, including workers from 27 public and private factories in the district and cadres from 8 government offices, along with more than 100 illiterate people who did not take the placement exam, totaling over 900 people. The entire school is divided into 25 classes (20 elementary classes and 5 intermediate classes). The school affairs committee is composed of nine relevant units in the district, with District Head Han Linguang serving as the principal. At the opening ceremony, Principal Han pointed out the importance of learning and the attitude students should have, explaining that without a certain level of education, it would be difficult to better improve production technology and improve work. The workers and cadres participating in the study were in high spirits. Hu Qi, a female worker from the newly built glass factory, said: "Today we can study culture here, which was exchanged for by the blood of revolutionary martyrs. We must cherish this learning opportunity, otherwise we will be too sorry for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." (Ma Zhixin and Xu Xing, Tenth District)

　　京十区九百余工人、干部  参加业余学校学习
    【本报讯】京市第十区工人、干部业余学校于十七日正式举行开学典礼。自京市第二届各界人民代表会议决议开展业余学校后，三月初，该区即积极进行筹备工作。这次参加编班考试的学员有八四六人，其中包括该区二十七个公私营工厂的工人及八个机关的干部，连同没有编班的一百多个文盲共九百余人。全校共分二十五班（初级二十班，中级五班）。校务委员会是由全区有关的九个单位组成，区长韩林光任校长。在开学典礼大会上，韩校长指出了学习的重要性及学员应有的态度，说明若没有一定的文化程度，是很难更好地提高生产技术和改进工作的。参加学习的工人、干部们的情绪至为高涨。新建玻璃厂的女工胡琦说：今天我们能在这里学文化，是革命先烈们用鲜血换来的，我们一定要珍重这个学习机会，不然就太对不起共产党和毛主席了。（十区马志新、许行）
