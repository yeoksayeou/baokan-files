Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: In order to realize its conspiracy of long-term occupation of Japan under the "unproclaimed peace" plan, the U.S. government has arbitrarily allowed Japan to participate in international conferences. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on February 24th, the U.S. government has notified the member states of the Far Eastern Commission that the U.S. government has authorized MacArthur to send Japanese representatives to any international conference that invites them, and to abide by any agreements reached at the conference. A U.S. Information Service dispatch on February 27th stated: MacArthur, according to temporary instructions given to him by the U.S. government, has the right to allow Japan to participate in "technical" international agreements, conventions, and conferences. If Japan is invited, and MacArthur believes it is "beneficial to the occupation," Japan can participate in the agreements, conventions, and conferences. MacArthur will also "guide" the Japanese government in fulfilling any "obligations" it undertakes according to his policies.

A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters bluntly stated regarding this new measure, which followed the U.S.'s permission for Japan to establish consulates abroad: "This is a further implementation of the U.S. policy of peace with Japan without a treaty" (Agence France-Presse, February 24th). Prior to this, a United Press dispatch on February 12th quoted so-called Washington "diplomatic observers" as claiming that because it was impossible to convene a separate peace conference with Japan, "the United States will not engage in concluding a peace treaty with Japan, but will directly plan for peace for Japan."

　　在“不宣而和”阴谋下美帝擅准日本参加国际会议
    【新华社北京七日电】美国政府为了实现在“不宣而和”计划下长期占领日本的阴谋，已擅自允许日本参加国际会议。据法新社东京二月二十四日电，美国政府已通知远东委员会各会员国，美国政府已授权麦克阿瑟可以派遣日本代表参加任何邀请他们的国际会议，并遵守会议所达成的任何协定。美国新闻处二月二十七日电称：麦克阿瑟根据美国政府给他的临时指示，有权准许日本参加“技术性”的国际协定公约和会议。如果日本被邀请，且麦克阿瑟认为“对占领有利”，日本就可参加协定、公约和会议。麦克阿瑟并将“指导”日本政府履行按其政策所承当的任何“义务”。
    麦克阿瑟总部发言人对于美国紧接着允许日本在外国设立领事馆之后而来的这一新措施，直言无讳地说：“这是美国对日本不缔约而和的政策的进一步的实施”（法新社二月二十四日电）。在此以前，合众社二月十二日电曾引所谓华盛顿“外交观察家”声称：由于无法召开单独的对日和会，“美国将不从事于缔结对日和约，而迳为日本和平筹划”。
