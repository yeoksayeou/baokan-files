　　Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory Union Achieves Success by Focusing on Production

[Report from our newspaper] Since clarifying the correct policy of focusing on production, the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory Union, affiliated with the Chahar Provincial Department of Industry, has effectively promoted union work and the movement to create new production records. After the factory started operation on August 1st of last year, the union work was trapped in the quagmire of bureaucratism for nearly half a year, busy with "welfare" all day long. The leadership of production was limited to abstract appeals and mobilization. Therefore, the production enthusiasm in each workshop was not high, and the workers' morale was not normal. After the Zhangjiakou Municipal Workers' Congress in December last year, although it began to clarify the importance of focusing on production, it did not know where to start. Until mid-January, with the help of the factory branch and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the union cadres focused on the No. 4 and 5 cigarette machines in the cigarette rolling workshop. First, they assisted drivers Yu Chaopin, Ji Shuming, and others to actively study and improve their skills in the spirit of "people not leaving the machine, the machine not leaving the people," so that the average consumption of cigarette rolling paper was reduced from 4.26% last year to 1.467%. The emergence of this new record was praised and encouraged by all parties. The union seized this example and immediately carried out education among the staff and workers, and promoted the experience to various workshops and groups. The production and savings record-breaking movement in the factory gradually unfolded.

After the movement gradually unfolded, it more significantly exposed that the union's organizational work could not keep up with the needs of the movement. Therefore, six branch unions were established in various workshops, and 47 members from various departments were elected, solving the problem of union cadres holding too many concurrent positions, which seriously affected production. For example, the packaging workshop had nearly 200 workers, but in the past, only Zhang Xiulan (a female worker), a member of the factory union, was in charge. Because union work took up too much time, it not only seriously affected her wage income (piece-rate wages), but also made her work poorly. Since the establishment of the branch union in the workshop and the election of seven members, various necessary meeting systems and formal leadership relationships have been established. Zhang Xiulan's production has not only not been affected, but also all her work has made significant progress.

With the improvement of the union's work, it also promoted the vigorous development of the movement. When the administration arranged the production tasks for the first quarter, the union immediately led the members to widely discuss in production team and workshop meetings, and put forward specific plans to ensure the completion of the tasks. Due to the close guarantee of semi-finished product specifications and quantities between various processes and the establishment of liaison contracts, it laid a more solid foundation for creating collective new records. According to preliminary statistics at the end of February, the production plan was exceeded by more than 330 boxes of cigarettes, and nearly 500,000 jin of millet were saved in rolling paper, tobacco leaves, etc., reducing the total cost by more than 7%.

To cooperate with the in-depth development of the movement, the union's work is extremely active. Blackboards and bulletins of various content are generally set up in each workshop to reflect the production situation and experience in a timely manner; in the mixing, cigarette rolling, and packaging workshops, "daily production progress comparison tables for each group" and "product quantity, quality, and consumption comparison tables for each group" have been established, which vigorously encourages the enthusiasm of the staff and workers.

　　张垣纸烟厂工会面向生产已获成绩
    【本报讯】察哈尔省工业厅所属张垣纸烟厂工会工作，自明确了面向生产的正确方针后，有力的推进了工会工作和创造生产新纪录运动。该厂自去年八月一日开工后，在近半年内，工会工作一直陷于事务主义的泥坑，终日忙于“福利”，对生产的领导仅限于抽象的号召和动员，因此各车间生产劲头不大，工人情绪不够正常。去年十二月张市工代会后，虽然开始明确了面向生产的重要，但又不知从何下手。直至一月中旬，在工厂支部和市总工会的帮助下，工会干部以卷烟室四、五号机车为工作重点，首先协助司机于朝品、纪书明等四人，以“人不离车，车不离人”的精神积极钻研改进技术，使卷烟盘纸由去年百分之四·二六的平均耗损量减低到百分之一·四六七。这一新纪录的出现，受到各方面的表扬和鼓励。工会抓住这一实例，立即在职工中进行教育，把经验推广到各车间、小组，该厂生产节约创纪录运动因此逐步展开。
    运动逐步开展后，更显著暴露出工会组织工作赶不上运动需要。因此在各车间建立了六个分工会，选出各部门委员四十七人，解决了工会干部兼职过多，严重影响生产的偏向。如包装室近二百工人，过去只有厂工会委员张秀兰（女工）一人领导，因工会工作占用时间过多，不仅严重的影响她工资收入（计件工资），并且工作也做不好。该室自建立分工会，选出七名委员后，建立了各种必要的会议制度和正规领导关系，张秀兰的生产不但不受影响，各项工作均有显著进步。
    随着工会工作的改进，同时更促进了运动蓬勃开展。当行政上布置第一季生产任务后，工会即领导会员在生产小组、车间等会议上广泛讨论，纷纷提出保证任务完成的具体计划。由于各工序间密切保证了半成品规格和数量，订立了联系合同，因此更加打下创造集体新纪录的基础。据二月底初步统计，超过原订生产计划增产烟三百三十余箱，节省盘纸、烟叶等折小米将近五十万斤，减低总成本量百分之七强。
    配合运动的深入展开，工会工作极为活跃。在各车间普遍设立各种内容的黑板报及喜报，及时反映生产情况和经验；在调切、卷烟、包装室，建立了“各组逐日生产进度比较表”、“各组产品数量、质量、耗损量比较表”，有力的鼓舞了职工们的工作积极性。
