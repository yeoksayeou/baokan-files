　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: Labor bureaus in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Northeast and other provinces, as well as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Taiyuan and other cities, have been working hard to handle labor relations in the past six months, and have gradually brought the current labor relations to normal and gained experience.

　　Due to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government before liberation, workers suffered from heavy exploitation and oppression by the capitalists, and the labor-capital contradiction was sharp. Therefore, in the early days of liberation, workers were generally dissatisfied with the capitalists, demanding to organize trade unions, improve treatment, increase wages, and abolish unreasonable systems. These spontaneous demands and struggles are completely understandable, but there were also some over-left actions and excessive demands. At the same time, the capitalists, who had long exploited the workers, were deeply deceived by the Kuomintang's propaganda and misunderstood the policies of the People's Government, and were generally fearful and uneasy. Some made promises to the workers' demands, but were passive in production, secretly withdrawing capital, maintaining appearances, or exaggerating difficulties under the pretext of poor business, demanding to dismiss workers and reduce production.

　　In this situation, trade union workers patiently carried out propaganda and education to the workers, and began to organize workers and establish trade unions, so that workers had a more correct understanding of the meaning of the policy of "both labor and capital benefit, develop production" and their status as masters of the country after liberation. On the other hand, the government's labor bureau and industry and commerce bureau also widely carried out policy propaganda to the capitalists, so that the capitalists gained a preliminary understanding of the government's policies and gradually dispelled their fear and uneasiness. However, with the removal of this fear, some capitalists took a counter-offensive against the workers, deliberately misinterpreted the policies out of context, provoked workers' solidarity, dismissed or attacked worker representatives and activists, hindered workers from organizing trade unions, or reduced workers and lowered wages under the pretext of financial difficulties, and canceled workers' benefits, attempting to carry out illegal struggles by "legal" means, thus making labor-capital disputes serious and production decline in these factories or shops. However, some capitalists truly implemented the policies, actively united with the workers, and reasonably improved the workers' treatment, so that the production in these factories and enterprises was increasingly improved and increased.

　　At this time, the local labor bureaus further publicized the policies and began to mediate labor disputes. However, the mediation work in various places was initially solved one by one in a handicraft manner, which was very laborious and ineffective. Later, many regions adopted the method of summoning labor and capital parties with similar disputes, explaining policies, and collective mediation, and the effectiveness was improved accordingly. At the same time, local governments successively promulgated interim measures for the procedures for handling labor disputes, so that there was something to follow in the mediation work. The business system of the mediation work itself was also established accordingly, such as application registration, issuing mediation letters, and mediation records. Since the signing of the collective labor contract of the Beijing State Pharmaceutical Industry in July last year, the mediation of labor disputes has obtained a more complete method, and labor-capital collective contracts have begun to be signed throughout the country. The signing of labor-capital collective contracts has enabled labor-capital relations to be adjusted in an organized and planned manner. In industries where collective contracts have been signed, labor-capital disputes have been greatly reduced, and production has been rapidly restored and developed accordingly.

    处理劳资关系取得经验   
    签订集体合同后，劳资纠纷大减，生产随之恢复与发展
    【新华社北京二十七日电】山西、山东、河南、东北等省及北京、天津、上海、青岛、太原等城市劳动局半年来努力处理劳资关系的结果，已使目前劳资关系逐渐走上正常，并取得了经验。
    由于解放前国民党政权的反动统治，工人受尽资方苛重剥削与压迫，劳资双方尖锐对立，因而解放初期，工人普遍对资本家心怀不满，要求组织工会，改善待遇，提高工资，取消不合理制度。这些自发要求与斗争是完全可以理解的，但也发生过一些过左行动和过高要求。与此同时，资本家因曾长期压榨工人；又深受国民党欺骗宣传，对人民政府的政策发生误解，普遍恐惧不安。有的一面对工人的要求满口应承，一面则对生产消极，暗地抽资，维持门面，或借口营业不振，夸大困难，要求解雇工人，缩小生产。
    在此情况下，工会工作人员即向工人进行耐心的宣传教育，并开始组织工人，成立工会，使工人对“劳资两利、发展生产”的政策以及解放后自己成为国家的主人翁地位的意义有了比较正确的认识。另方面，政府劳动局、工商局也向资方广泛进行政策宣传，使资本家对政府政策获得初步了解，逐渐解除恐惧与不安。但随着这种恐惧心理的解除，有些资本家却向工人采取反攻，有意断章取义地曲解政策，挑拨工人团结，解雇或打击工人代表和积极分子，阻挠工人组织工会，或借口资金困难，裁减工人，降低工资，取消工人福利，企图以“合法”手段进行非法斗争，因而使这些工厂或商号中劳资纠纷严重，生产低落。但也有一些资本家，真正执行政策，主动地与工人团结，合理改善工人待遇，因而在这些工厂企业中的生产也就日益改善和提高起来。
    在此时期，各地劳动局乃进一步宣传政策，同时着手劳资争议之调处。但各地调处工作起初还只是一件一件地手工业方式地来解决，费力很大，收效不多。其后，有不少地区则采取召集同类性质纠纷的劳资双方，讲解政策，集体调解，效力随之提高。同时，各地政府复先后颁发了劳动争议调处程序暂行办法，使调处工作有所遵循。调处工作本身的业务制度也随之建立，如申请登记、发调解书及调解笔录等。至去年七月北京市国药业劳资集体合同签订后，劳资纠纷的调处获得了更完善的方法，全国各地都随着开始签订劳资集体合同。劳资集体合同的签订，使劳资关系得以有组织有计划地调整，凡已签订集体合同的行业，劳资纠纷大大减少，生产随之迅速恢复与发展。
