Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: Experiences from various local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations demonstrate that establishing regular propaganda and educational work for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is the key to consolidating the organization and expanding and deepening pro-Soviet friendship activities.

When local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations began their work last year, they widely conducted propaganda and education on internationalism, greatly increasing membership. Especially after the establishment of the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in October last year, membership grew even more rapidly, exceeding two million by the end of January this year. This represents a threefold increase in four months, and the number of people participating in organized Sino-Soviet friendship activities nationwide has reached over ten million to date. However, most local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations have focused on temporary activities and neglected to establish regular work, leading to the organization becoming a mere formality and various activities failing to continue in depth. Some local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations even have almost no work other than holiday activities. The membership of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association generally reflects: "What do we do after joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association? Joining or not joining makes no difference!"

Some localities, due to improving their regular work, have seen the consolidation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organization, and mass pro-Soviet friendship activities have gradually deepened. The Lushun-Dalian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a notable example. Since March of last year, the association reviewed past deviations and determined the policy of developing the organization from consolidation, focusing on propaganda and education, and establishing regular work. Within last year, it published over 500,000 copies of regular publications, pictorials, and series promoting Sino-Soviet friendship, and held clubs, training classes, report meetings, seminars, weekly lectures, exhibitions, get-togethers, reading groups, mobile libraries, visiting groups, Russian night schools, broadcast lectures, music and dance night schools, and film screenings, attracting a total of over 4.7 million participants. In these regular activities, the Lushun-Dalian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organization was gradually consolidated and developed. According to statistics at the end of last year, membership reached over 240,000, an increase of more than 70% compared to the previous year. The Beijing and Zhangjiakou Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations also began to establish regular work after January this year. In addition to organizing members to listen to lectures and reports, conduct study discussions, screen films, exhibit pictures, and hold Russian night schools and broadcast lectures, the general branch of the Beijing 13th District Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also launched a "One Book Movement," collecting 450 books related to Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union from members, and organizing exchanges for reading. The Zhangjiakou Sino-Soviet Friendship Association published 1,000 copies of "Sino-Soviet Friendship" learning materials and is preparing to establish a "Sino-Soviet Cultural Service Center" and reading room. Based on the development and deepening of work, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is striving to develop 50,000 new members this month.

According to the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association: The current working policy of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations throughout the country is generally to greatly develop the organization, but in order to truly achieve voluntary participation and avoid the organization becoming a mere formality, it is necessary to expand and deepen mass pro-Soviet friendship activities and establish regular work centered on propaganda and education. Therefore, the tendency of some local Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations to not flexibly utilize various activity methods and simply carry out some temporary activities such as holiday commemorations must be corrected in a timely manner.

　　中苏友协迅速发展会员已超过二百万
    建立经常的宣传教育工作，是扩大与深入对苏友好活动的关键
    【新华社二十五日讯】各地中苏友好协会工作的经验证明：建立中苏友好协会的经常的宣传教育工作，是巩固中苏友好协会组织，扩大与深入对苏友好活动的关键。
    当去年各地中苏友好协会开始工作时，均曾广泛进行了有关国际主义的宣传教育工作，大量发展了会员，尤其自去年十月中苏友协总会成立后，会员发展更为迅速，至今年一月底已超过二百万人，即于四个月内增加了两倍，全国参加有组织的中苏友好活动的人数迄今已达一千万以上。但是，多数地方中苏友好协会因偏重于临时性活动，忽略建立经常工作，以致使组织流于形式，各种活动不能继续深入。甚至有些地方中苏友好协会除节日活动以外，几乎没有什么工作。中苏友好协会的会员群众普遍反映：“加入中苏友协做些什么呀？入会不入会还不是一样！”
    若干地方由于健全了经常工作，中苏友好协会组织随之巩固，群众性的对苏友好活动得以逐渐深入。旅大中苏友好协会即为显著例子。该会自去年三月即检讨了过去的偏向，确定了从巩固中发展组织的方针，以宣教工作为重点，建立经常工作。去年一年内共出版宣传中苏友好的定期刊物、画报与丛书五十万余册，举办俱乐部、训练班、报告会、座谈会、星期讲座、展览会、联欢会、读书会、流动图书馆、参观团、俄语夜校、广播讲座、音乐舞蹈夜校及放映电影等，共吸收了四百七十余万人参加这些活动。在这些经常性的活动中，旅大中苏友好协会组织随之逐步巩固与发展。据去年底统计，会员已达二十四万余人，较上年度增加了百分之七十以上。北京与张家口中苏友好协会亦自今年一月以后开始建立经常工作。除组织会员听演讲报告，进行学习讨论，放映电影，展览图片，举办俄文夜校及广播讲座外，北京十三区中苏友好协会总支会并发动“一本书运动”，由会员中募集了有关中苏友好与学习苏联的图书四百五十册，有组织地交换阅读。张家口中苏友好协会出版“中苏友谊”学习材料一千册，并筹设“中苏文化服务社”与阅览室。在工作开展与深入的基础上，北京中苏友好协会正在争取在本月份内发展五万新会员。
    据中苏友好协会总会方面表示：目前全国各地中苏友好协会的工作方针，一般地还是大量发展组织，但为了真正作到自愿参加并避免组织流于形式，必须扩大与深入群众性的对苏友好活动，建立以宣传教育工作为中心的经常工作。因此，有些地方的中苏友好协会组织不去灵活地运用各种各样的活动方式，而单纯地进行一些节日纪念等临时性活动的偏向，须及时纠正。
