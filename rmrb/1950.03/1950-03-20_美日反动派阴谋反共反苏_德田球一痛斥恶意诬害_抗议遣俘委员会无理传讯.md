　　Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: According to a Tokyo dispatch by TASS on the 18th, the Special Committee on Prisoner Repatriation of the Japanese Senate began questioning Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, on the 16th, investigating whether Tokuda had requested the Soviet Union to delay the repatriation of "reactionary elements" among Japanese prisoners of war. This question was raised to the committee by a specially selected group of so-called "Rising Sun" group of returned prisoners of war not long ago. According to reports, before the questioning began, 500 representatives from the press and other people gathered in the committee's conference room. In his speech, Tokuda emphasized that the Soviet TASS news agency has officially refuted the news that the Japanese Communist Party requested not to repatriate "reactionary elements." Tokuda asked the committee chairman Okamoto: "I demand an explanation, on what grounds does the Senate raise this question again?" According to reports, the conference room "experienced temporary chaos." This is natural because there is no material to support the accusations made by the self-proclaimed "Rising Sun" group. These accusations were fabricated by the Japanese reactionary group on the orders of the American occupation authorities and have obvious provocative purposes. The committee members raised some mythical "other people who were repatriated" in an attempt to accuse Tokuda. However, their speeches aroused angry shouts from reporters and audience members. The committee chairman ordered some audience members to leave the conference room. The Tokyo press pointed out that "Tokuda was completely dominant at the committee meeting," putting the committee members who attempted to accuse Tokuda in a very embarrassing position.
　　According to Kyodo News Agency Tokyo: On March 15th, the Japanese Communist Party protested to Sato Naotake, Speaker of the Senate, regarding the provocative behavior of the Special Committee on Prisoner Repatriation of the Japanese Senate in summoning Tokuda Kyuichi based on slander. They also issued a statement pointing out that the committee's summons this time demonstrated a barbaric and unreasonable attitude, exposed a profound political conspiracy, and was also an intentional anti-Soviet provocation. This conspiracy is part of a planned anti-Soviet and anti-communist action by the Yoshida Cabinet and reactionary forces. The JCP Diet members also issued a statement on the 16th regarding the summons of Tokuda, condemning the Special Committee on Prisoner Repatriation for maliciously using the rules of the Diet and trampling on human rights.

　　美日反动派阴谋反共反苏
    德田球一痛斥恶意诬害
    抗议遣俘委员会无理传讯
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社十八日引东京消息称：日本参议院遣俘特别委员会于十六日开始传讯日共总书记德田球一，调查所谓德田曾否要求苏联从缓遣回日本战俘中的“反动分子”。这个问题系由一特别挑选出来的所谓“旭日”集团的回国战俘在不久前向该委员会提出的。据消息称，在未开始传讯前，已有五百名报界代表及其他人士聚集于委员会的会议室中。德田在其发言中着重指出：苏联塔斯社已正式驳斥，所传日本共产党要求不要遣回“反动分子”的消息。德田对该委员会主席冈本称：“我要求解释，根据什么理由，参院又提出这个问题。”据消息称，会议室曾“发生暂时的混乱”。这是很自然的，因为没有任何材料足以支持那个自命为所谓“旭日”的集团所提的控诉，这个控诉乃是日本反动集团按照美国占领当局的命令制造的，具有明显的挑拨性的目的。该委员会的委员们提出某种神话似的“其他被遣送回国的人”，企图对德田提出控诉。但是，他们的发言在记者及旁听人中引起了愤怒的喊声。委员会主席命令若干旁听人离开会议室。东京新闻界指出：“德田在委员会的会议上完全处于优势”，使那些企图对德田提出控诉的委员们，处于很难堪的地位。
    另据共同社东京讯：日本共产党十五日对日本参议院遣俘特别委员会利用谰言，传讯德田球一的挑拨行为，向参院议长佐藤尚武提出抗议，并发表声明，指出该委员会这次的传讯，表现了蛮横无理的态度，暴露出深刻的政治阴谋，同时也是有意的反苏联的挑拨行为。这种阴谋是吉田内阁和反动势力有计划的反苏反共行动的一部分。日共国会议员团十六日亦对传讯德田事发表声明，谴责遣俘特别委员会恶意利用国会规章，蹂躏人权。
