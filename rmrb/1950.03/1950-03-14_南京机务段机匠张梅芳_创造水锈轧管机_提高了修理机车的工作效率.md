Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 13th:

　　Zhang Meifang, a mechanic at the Nanjing Depot of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, has created a water rust rolling machine, significantly improving locomotive repair technology. In the past, when repairing locomotives at the depot, the more than 170 large and small flues inside the boiler needed to have their ends cut off, and workers would use hammers to knock off the water rust on the tubes one by one. It took about 80 minutes to knock off the rust from each large flue and about 15 minutes for a small flue. Cutting the flue heads with a lathe took another 14 minutes for each one. This was not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also easily damaged the flues due to excessive hammering. After more than two months of research, mechanic Zhang Meifang used scrap iron to create a water rust rolling machine weighing over 300 kilograms. This machine uses electricity to drive the removal of rust and the cutting of the tube heads simultaneously. Using this machine, a large flue only takes 11 minutes, and a small flue takes 5 minutes, greatly improving work efficiency.

    【新华社南京十三日电】沪宁铁路南京机务段机匠张梅芳创造了水锈轧管机，使修理机车技术大大提高一步。该段过去修机车时，锅炉内的一百七十余个大小气管，均须轧断气管两头，由工人用铁锤一根一根地敲掉管上水锈。大气管敲掉水锈每根约需八十分钟，小气管约需一刻钟；气管头用车床锯轧，每轧一个又需时十四分钟。这样不但耗费时间和劳动力，且往往因敲击过重而容易损坏气管。机匠张梅芳经两个多月的研究，利用废铁制成了一件重约三百余公斤的水锈轧管机。此机利用电力发动，可以同时去锈和轧掉管头。利用这一机器工作，大气管只需十一分钟，小气管需五分钟，因而大大提高了工作效率。
