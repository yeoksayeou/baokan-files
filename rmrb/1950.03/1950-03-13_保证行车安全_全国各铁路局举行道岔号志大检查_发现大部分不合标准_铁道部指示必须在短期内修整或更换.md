　　Guaranteeing Safe Train Operation
    National Railway Bureaus Conduct Extensive Inspection of Turnouts and Signals
    Finding Most Substandard
    Ministry of Railways Directs Immediate Repair or Replacement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th] According to the order of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, railway bureaus across the country conducted a nationwide inspection of turnouts and signals on the 25th of last month. The purpose of this inspection was to ensure safe train operation and prevent accidents. The inspection results revealed that most of the turnouts and signals in various railway bureaus did not meet the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. The Northeast Railway Bureau inspected 8,873 sets of turnouts, of which 3,077 sets were substandard. Of the 1,115 sets of turnouts under the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Bureau, as many as 1,109 sets were substandard. Only a small portion of these were due to a lack of materials, making repairs difficult at the time, while the vast majority could have been repaired to meet the standards, but were not. For example, of the 172 turnouts in the South and North stations of Shijiazhuang, only 103 were substandard due to material reasons, while 593 could have been repaired but were not. The Ministry of Railways has now instructed the bureaus to complete the repair of turnouts that can be repaired in the short term, and to improve repair and manufacturing capabilities as much as possible in order to repair or replace substandard turnouts.

    铁道部指示必须在短期内修整或更换
    【新华社北京十二日电】全国铁路局根据中央人民政府铁道部的命令，于上月二十五日举行了全国道岔及号志大检查。这次检查的目的是保证行车安全，防止事故发生。检查结果，发现各路局的道岔及号志大部分不合铁道部规定的标准。东北铁路总局检查了八千八百七十三组道岔，其中有三千零七十七组不合标准。太原局管辖内一千一百十五组道岔中，更有一千一百零九组不合标准。其中只有一小部分是材料缺乏，一时难以修整的，而绝大部分则是可以修整合于标准的，但未修整。如石家庄南、北两站的一百七十二个道岔中，因材料关系不合标准的仅有一百零三处，可以修整而没有修整的则有五百九十三处。铁道部现已指示各局，必须在短期内将可以修整的道岔修整完毕，并尽可能提高修造能力，以便修理或更换不合于标准的道岔。
