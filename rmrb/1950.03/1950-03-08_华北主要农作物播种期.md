Sowing dates for crops vary greatly due to climate, environment, and variety. Often, places only a few miles apart may have drastically different sowing conditions. One location may be perfectly suitable for sowing, while the other is already too late, or vice versa. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively state that a certain date in a certain month is universally the optimal sowing time for any crop. However, there is an optimal period and periods close to the optimal. By using these flexibly, calculating yields and economic value, and deciding which crop to plant, one can have an 80% certainty of success by grasping the inherent规律性regularity. We believe that both farmers and cadres leading production should have a precise understanding of sowing dates. Based on our investigations and farm experiments, we will now provide a brief introduction to the sowing dates of major crops for reference in various regions:

　　One, Spring-Sown Crops

　　Spring-sown crops include barley, peas, spring wheat, hyacinth beans, naked oats, etc. Their sowing period is in the spring and they mature in the summer. Due to regional climate differences, the planting of these spring-sown crops varies from place to place. For example, in central Hebei, barley is mostly planted, with a small amount of spring wheat. In the western Hebei mountains, some barley, peas, and hyacinth beans are planted, and naked oats are also planted in some areas. In northeastern Shanxi and southern Chahar, spring wheat, naked oats, barley, and peas are mostly planted, while in northern Chahar, naked oats and spring wheat are mostly planted.

　　Among these crops, hyacinth beans are planted the earliest. In western Hebei, some are sown as early as the Jingzhe (惊蛰Awakening of Insects) solar term, and at the latest by the Vernal Equinox.

　　In western and central Hebei, barley and spring wheat are mostly sown a few days before the Vernal Equinox, and at the latest by the Qingming (清明Tomb-Sweeping Day) Festival. In southern Chahar and northeastern Shanxi, sowing should be completed after Qingming and before Guyu (谷雨Grain Rain). In northern Chahar, due to the cold climate, there is still spring frost during the Guyu season, so the sowing period should be around the Beginning of Summer.

　　The sowing period for peas in western Hebei is mostly after the Vernal Equinox, and at the latest a few days after Qingming. In southern Hebei, sowing must be completed before the Beginning of Summer. The sowing period for naked oats in Chahar Province is mostly before the Beginning of Summer. Generally, in warm plains areas, there are still sowings after the Beginning of Summer and Grain Full.

　　In general, spring-sown crops have a shorter growing period. In many places, they are also early-stage crops, and millet and other crops are sown in the later stage. Therefore, whether it is barley or peas, efforts should be made to sow early because their growing period is short and their optimal sowing period is also very short. Furthermore, the seedlings of these crops are resistant to cold and do not require high temperatures during their growth period. Excessively high temperatures are detrimental to their growth and maturity. Therefore, the sowing period for spring-sown crops should be "rather too early than too late."

　　Two, Cotton

　　The optimal sowing period for cotton, regardless of Chinese cotton or American cotton, is generally five days before and after the Beginning of Summer. The saying "Sow early during Guyu, late during Grain Full, and cotton is just right at the Beginning of Summer" is correct.

　　The sowing period range for cotton is about one month, from Guyu to Grain Full. Generally, farmers prefer to sow American cotton early, while Chinese cotton can be delayed a little. However, according to farm experiments, the opposite is true: it doesn't matter if American cotton is sown later, but if Chinese cotton is sown late, the yield is greatly reduced. We divided the sowing period into the following stages and conducted a two-year experiment on the sowing period of Chinese and American cotton. The solar terms in the spring of these two years were:

　　April 1st April 8th (Guyu) April 15th April 22nd (Beginning of Summer) April 29th

　　May 6th (Grain Full) May 13th May 20th (Grain in Ear) May 27th June 3rd (Summer Solstice). The results showed that the optimal period for American cotton was from April 15th to May 13th, during which the highest yield was achieved. Sowing after May 20th resulted in a lower yield. Sowing on April 1st and April 8th resulted in good seedling growth, but due to the cold climate, there were fewer seedlings, and the yield was not very high. Sowing on May 27th and June 3rd was too late, resulting in a much lower yield.

　　The optimal sowing period for Chinese cotton is from April 15th to April 29th, with a larger yield. Sowing on May 6th resulted in a sharp decrease in yield, and sowing after May 13th resulted in a very low yield. Sowing on April 1st and April 8th also resulted in fewer seedlings due to the cold weather, and the yield was lower than that of May 13th. Therefore, we advocate that when the sowing period for cotton in various regions is later, it is better to plant American cotton than Chinese cotton. If it is an irrigated area, proper irrigation during the seedling stage to promote seedling development will result in a yield that is almost the same as early sowing. Several years of experience have yielded the same conclusion.

　　Three, Sesame

　　The sowing period for sesame can be as early as Guyu and as late as a few days after Grain in Ear, with a sowing period of nearly fifty days. However, its optimal period is from the Beginning of Summer to seven or eight days after Grain Full. Both late-maturing and early-maturing varieties can be sown. If sowing is done after the wheat harvest, then only early-maturing varieties can be planted. General late-maturing varieties cannot be planted.

　　Four, Sorghum

　　The sowing period for sorghum is generally from the Beginning of Summer to five days before Grain in Ear. However, sorghum seedlings do not require much water. If sown during Qingming, the weather is still cold, and the starch of the seeds is easily decomposed and rotted due to prolonged expansion. Farmers call this seed "powder destruction." However, if sorghum is sown late, it can be said that there will be a poor harvest nine out of ten years because sorghum requires a high temperature during flowering and maturity. The local saying "Sorghum in the dog days basking in rice" means that sorghum flowering and grain formation should be in the dog days. After the Mid-Autumn Festival in the north, fog often occurs, which greatly affects the pollination and grain setting of sorghum. Light fog results in sparse grain setting, while heavy fog results in no harvest. Therefore, we believe that the sowing period for sorghum is between the Beginning of Summer and Grain Full. However, in low-lying areas, it is necessary to sow earlier to avoid flooding, with Guyu being the appropriate time. Some say that white sorghum has strong adaptability and can be sown later. In our observations, we also feel that there is such a tendency, and we hope that various regions will pay attention to it.

　　Five, Corn

　　The sowing period for corn is as early as Guyu and as late as ten days after the Summer Solstice, with a period of more than sixty days. Due to the different varieties, the restrictions on the sowing period are also different: general late-maturing varieties such as "White Marestail," "Yellow Marestail," and "Large Golden Yellow" corn can be sown as early as Guyu and no later than Grain Full. Because their growing period is relatively long, they must be sown early. Second-crop corn can still be sown ten days after Grain in Ear, and "Sixty-Day Home" and "Little Badger Leg" corn can still be sown ten days after the Summer Solstice without being considered late. Generally speaking, it is better to sow corn early.

　　Six, Millet

　　Among the crops in North China, millet has the longest sowing period and is the most difficult to determine because the varieties are complex and greatly affected by the environment and other factors. According to records from various places, its sowing period is from Qingming to a few days after Lesser Heat, with a sowing period of about one hundred days. Which season is best for sowing? It varies from place to place. Now, let's take the experimental results of the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Second Farm – Lingshou Farm as a reference:

　　Millet Drought-Resistant Sowing Period Results

　　Sowing Period Yield per mu (jin) Difference (compared to Summer Solstice)
　　Guyu 147.9 jin Less 28 jin
　　Beginning of Summer 158.9 jin Less 17 jin
　　Grain Full 173.5 jin Less 2.4 jin
　　Grain in Ear 171.8 jin Less 4.1 jin
　　Summer Solstice 175.9 jin 0
　　Lesser Heat 132.0 jin Less 43.9 jin

　　From the above results, the optimal sowing period for millet can be said to be from Grain Full to Summer Solstice.

　　Due to natural environmental factors, there are also earlier or later sowings in addition to the above optimal period. For example, seeds are broadcast sown on reclaimed land before Guyu. The reason is that the wasteland slopes are overgrown with weeds, and early sowing can allow for early growth, avoiding weeds and water damage. The millet varieties used in these areas must be late-maturing and have characteristics such as drought resistance, strong stems, and resistance to wind. Early-maturing varieties are not suitable.

　　In dry areas, sowing must be delayed due to late rainfall.

　　Some places plant "Frozen Millet" (also known as Ghost Millet), which involves reclaiming wasteland before autumn and scattering millet seeds in early winter, which germinate and emerge in the following spring. According to this method, some say that it can advance the maturity period and improve quality, but our experiments have shown that it cannot be advanced.

　　Frozen Millet Experiment Results

　　Millet Variety Treatment Heading Period
　　Early-Maturing Red Millet Frozen Millet Seed July 1st
　　Unfrozen Millet Seed July 1st
　　Medium-Maturing Qu 5 Frozen Millet Seed July 9th
　　Unfrozen Millet Seed July 9th
　　Late-Maturing 811 Frozen Millet Seed July 11th
　　Unfrozen Millet Seed July 11th

　　From the above results, it is impossible for frozen millet to mature earlier. The reason is that frozen millet only puts the seeds in the ground, and there is no physiological change. It is no different from storage in a warehouse, so there is no effect of promoting early maturity. Moreover, when the weather warms up in the spring, the temperature is suitable for germination and emergence, making it easy to suffer from spring frost and wither. We have sown millet before Qingming and it froze to death because millet does not have the cold resistance of wheat, broad beans, etc., so this method is not very suitable.

　　Seven, Beans

　　① Soybeans and Black Beans

　　The sowing period for soybeans and black beans is the same, with the earliest being Guyu and the latest being the Summer Solstice. Because the growing period is short, the stems are short and the pods are sparse. The saying "Bean harvest requires tall plants" means that a good soybean harvest requires tall stems. The growth habits of beans are different from those of millet, etc. In the event of delayed rainfall, it is best not to sow black beans and soybeans.

　　② Mung Beans

　　The sowing period for mung beans is relatively long, from Guyu to before Lesser Heat. In western and central Hebei, they are mostly used as intercrops in millet fields. Also, because they mature early, some grains can still be harvested at a later time. However, it is best to sow after Grain Full and Grain in Ear. If sowing is done after the Summer Solstice, it is best to use early-maturing varieties (such as "Hairy Mung Bean," "A Handful of Snow," etc.).

　　③ Cowpeas

　　The sowing period for cowpeas is shorter than that of mung beans. They can be sown as early as Guyu and as late as a few days after the Summer Solstice. The optimal period is from the Beginning of Summer to a few days after Grain in Ear. Cowpeas sown after the Summer Solstice have short vines and sparse pods, cannot fully develop, and the yield is much lower.

　　Eight, Broomcorn Millet and Foxtail Millet

　　The sowing period for broomcorn millet and foxtail millet is no earlier than Grain Full and can be delayed until Lesser Heat. Early sowing of broomcorn millet will not result in a good harvest. The reason is that broomcorn millet and foxtail millet encounter high temperatures during flowering and grain setting, which hinders fruit formation. Farmers call this "heat yellowing." Late sowing reduces the chance of "heat yellowing." Due to the different varieties, there are also some differences in the sowing period. For example, "Ladle Head," "Large Willow Branch Broomcorn Millet," "Black Foxtail Millet," and "Yellow Foxtail Millet" can be sown after Grain Full. If sowing is done around Lesser Heat, "Small Broomcorn Millet" and "Small Foxtail Millet" are more suitable. In southern Chahar and northern Yanbei, regardless of early-maturing or late-maturing varieties, most are sown around Grain in Ear. The reason is that these areas are mostly single-cropping systems. In central and western Hebei, they are mostly double-cropping systems.

　　Nine, Sweet Potatoes (Yams)

　　Sweet potatoes are divided into seedling planting and vine cutting. The timing of seedling planting depends on how early the seedlings are grown. Generally, the earliest first transplanting of sweet potato seedlings is six days before the Beginning of Summer, and the latest is Grain in Ear. Because the seedlings are relatively thin and weak by this time, and the weather is hot, it is not easy for them to survive, so vine cutting is better than planting seedlings.

　　The timing of vine cutting depends on how early the seedlings are cultivated. Recently, some people have specialized in cultivating seedlings, and the vines of the earliest planted seedlings can be cut as early as Grain in Ear with intentional fertilization and irrigation. Drought-resistant seedlings can only be cut around the Summer Solstice. Therefore, the earliest restriction on vine cutting is no earlier than Grain in Ear, and the latest can be a few days after Lesser Heat. The saying "No potatoes seen in the heat" means that sweet potatoes should no longer be planted by Lesser Heat. Some farmers plant and insert seedlings before the Second Dog Day. Although they can produce some, it is not as appropriate as planting other crops.

　　Generally speaking, it is better to plant sweet potatoes early, whether planting seedlings or cutting vines, because sweet potatoes have a relatively long growing period, and giving them sufficient time to develop will result in a good harvest.

　　华北主要农作物播种期
    马矍翁
    作物的播种期，因气候、环境及品种等的关系，有极大的差别，常有近只十数里的地方，甲地尚适于播种，乙地则已失之过晚；或者是乙地播种适宜时期，甲地则认为过早。因此，任何一种作物若确定其某月某日播种适期，让一律通用，是不可能的。不过他有适期，有前后接近适期，灵活运用，计算收量与经济价值，决定种植那一种作物，抓住他的规律性，就可能有百分之八十的把握。我们觉得无论农民和领导生产的干部，对播种期问题，都应当有精密的了解。现在就我们的调查和农场的试验，对于主要作物的播种期，作一简单的介绍，以供各地的参考：
            一、春播作物
    春播作物包括大麦、豌豆、春小麦、扁豆、莜麦等。他的播种期在春季，成熟在夏季，因地域气候的关系，各地对以上几种春播作物的种植也不一样。如冀中则大部种大麦，间有少量春麦；冀西山地则大麦、豌豆、扁豆都种一些、莜麦有的地方也种一些；晋东北，察南大多地区种春小麦、莜麦、大麦、豌豆等，察北就多数种莜麦和春小麦了。
    在这几种作物里边，种的最早的当属扁豆，冀西种扁豆，有在惊蛰就下种的，最迟不过春分。
    冀西冀中各地，播种大麦和春小麦，多在春分前几天播种，最迟不过清明。在察南，晋东北则在清明后谷雨前要播完，察北则因气候寒冷，谷雨节季还有春霜，播种期要在立夏前后。
    豌豆的播种期在冀西多在春分后种，至迟可到清明后几天。在冀南，则在立夏前要种好。莜麦的播种期，在察省多在立夏前播完。一般平原暖和地区，立夏、小满后还有种的。
    总起来说，春播作物的生长期较短，在很多地方，又是前期作物，下期还要播种谷黍等，所以无论大麦豌豆等，要争取早播，原因是他的生长期短，他的播种适期也很短。还有这些作物的幼苗抗寒力强，在生长期间不需要高的温度，过高的温度对他的生长及成熟有碍。因此，春播作物的播种期，应该是“宁失之早，勿失之迟”。
            二、棉花
    各地棉花的播种适期，不论中棉美棉，都以立夏前后五几天最好。所谓“谷雨早，小满迟，立夏的棉花正当时”，这句话是正确的。
    棉花的播种期范围，前后约一月，即由谷雨至小满。一般农民对美棉播种多喜欢提早，中棉倒可延迟一些。但是根据农场试验，恰与这个说法相反，就是美棉晚播些没关系，中棉晚播，则收量减低很多。我们分了下列的几个播种期，实行了二年中美棉播种期的试验。两年中春季节气是：
    四月一日  四月八日（谷雨）四月十五  四月二十二（立夏）  四月二十九
    五月六日（小满）  五月十三日  五月二十（芒种）五月二十七  六月三日（夏至）结果是美棉的最适期，为四月十五至五月十三日，在此时期内播种的，产量最高；五月二十以后种的，产量就差一些，四月一日和四月八日种的，苗子长的很好，但是因为气候冷，出苗很少，收量也不很高。五月二十七和六月三号，因为过晚，收量也就低的多了。
    中棉的播种最适期，为四月十五至四月二十九，产量较大，到五月六日播种的，产量即陡减；五月十三日以后播种的，产量就极少了。四月一日和四月八日，也是因为天气寒冷，出苗较少，产量亦较五月十三者为低。因此我们提倡各地种棉时期晚一些的时候，宁种美棉勿种中棉，若系灌溉地区，在幼苗时期，适当灌溉，促其幼苗发育，则收量与早期播种的相差无几，几年来经验与此结论还相同。
            三、芝麻
    芝麻的播种期可早自谷雨，晚至芒种后三几天，有将近五十天的播种期。不过它的适期，可从立夏起至小满后七八天，晚熟种早熟种皆可播种。若在麦收后播种，那就非种早熟的品种不可了，一般的晚熟种就不可能播种了。
            四、高粱
    高粱的播种期一般的从立夏起始，至芒种前五几天止。不过高粱出苗不需要多的水分，若在清明播种，天气尚冷，种子经长期的膨胀，其淀粉易起分解而腐烂。农民所谓种子“粉毁”，就是这个原因。但是高粱晚种，可说十年九不收，原因是高粱在开花成熟时，需要的温度较高，乡谚“伏里高粱晒米”就是说高粱开花结粒要在伏天才好。北方一到中秋后即常发生雾，雾对高粱的受粉结实很受影响，轻则结粒稀少，重则颗粒不收。所以我们认为高粱的播种期是在立夏前后到小满前后这个期间。但在低洼地区为避免水淹须早播一些，以谷雨前后为适。有的说白高粱适应性强，晚播还可以，在观察中我们也觉得有这样的倾向，希望各地注意一下。
            五、玉米
    玉米的播种期早自谷雨，晚至夏至后十日，有六十多天的日期。因为品种的不同，播种期的限制也两样：一般的晚熟种像“白马牙”、“黄马牙”、“大金黄”等玉米，早可自谷雨起，晚不过小满。因为它的生长期比较长，必须早种才行。二桩玉米到芒种后十天还可播种，“六十日还家”和“小獾腿”到夏至后十天播种还不算晚。一般的说玉米是早种好一些。
            六、谷子
    在华北农作物中，谷子的播种期比较是最长，而最难确定的一种，原因是品种复杂，受环境及其他的影响最大。它的播种期根据各地的记载，由清明到小暑后几天，有一百来天的播种期。究竟是那一季节播种好？各地不同。现在我们拿原晋察冀边区第二农场试验——灵寿场试验结果作个参考：
    谷子抗旱播种期结果
    播种期              每亩收量（斤）          相差（与夏至较）
    谷雨                一四七·九斤            少二十八斤
    立夏                一五八·九斤            少一十七斤
    小满                一七三·五斤            少二·四斤
    芒种                一七一·八斤            少四·一斤
    夏至                一七五·九斤            ○
    小暑                一三二·○斤            少四三·九斤
    从上面这个结果看来，谷子播种的适期可以说由小满到夏至。
    因自然环境关系，除上述适期外，还有提早或延迟的。如开荒地在谷雨前即有撒播种子的。原因是荒坡杂草繁茂，早播可及早生长，可免去杂草和水害。在这些地区所用的谷种必须是晚熟种及具有抗旱、秆劲直、不怕风等的特性。早熟种是不适宜的。
    旱地区因降雨过迟，不得不延迟。
    有的地方种“冻谷”（又名鬼谷），即在秋前开荒地，于冬初的时候，将谷种撒上，来春即发芽出土。照这样种，有的说可提早成熟期及提高品质，但据我们的试验，证明是不能提早的。
        冻谷实验结果
    谷子品种                  处理          抽穗期
    早熟红谷              经冻谷种          七月一日
                          未冻谷种          七月一日
    中熟曲５              经冻谷种          七月九日
                          未冻谷种          七月九日
    晚熟八一一            经冻谷种          七月十一日
                          未冻谷种          七月十一日
    从上面结果看来，冻谷能提早成熟是不可能的，原因是冻谷仅是把种子放在地里，生理上没受到变化，他和仓库存放没什么分别，因此没发生提高早熟的作用。并且来春天暖，温度一适宜就发芽出苗，易遭春霜而萎死。我们在清明前播种过谷子，曾冻死，即因谷子没有麦子扁豆等的耐寒力，因此这个办法不大适宜。
            七、豆类
        ①黄豆和黑豆
    黄豆和黑豆的播种期相同，最早谷雨，最晚不过夏至。因为生长期短，杆矮荚稀，俗谚“豆收长桔”，就是说大豆收获好须有高长的杆子。豆的生长习性，是不同于谷黍等，在降雨迟的时候，顶好不要播种黑豆和黄豆。
        ②绿豆
    绿豆的播种期比较长，由谷雨至小暑前。在冀西冀中多做为谷田中之补植作物。也因为他成熟早，晚些时间还能收些粮食。可是最好小满芒种后播种。过夏至后播种，顶好是早熟种（如“毛绿豆”、“一捧雪”等）。
        ③豇豆
    豇豆的播种期比绿豆短一些，早亦可自谷雨，晚可在夏至后几天。适期自立夏到芒种后几天。在夏至后播种的则蔓短荚稀，不能充分发育，收量就少的多。
            八、黍稷
    黍稷的播种期，最早不过小满，最迟可延至小暑。黍子早种是不会丰收的。原因是黍稷在开花结粒时一遇高温妨碍结实。农民叫他“热黄”。晚播则比较“热黄”的时候少一些。因为品种的不同播期也有些差别，如“笊篱头”“大柳枝黍”“黑稷”“黄稷”在小满后即可播种。若在小暑前后，则以“小黍”“小稷”比较适宜些。在察南、雁北一带，无论早熟晚熟种则多在芒种前后播种。原因是此地区多为一熟制。在冀中冀西各地多为二熟制的后作。
            九、甘薯（红薯）
    红薯分栽秧和插蔓两种，栽秧期的迟早，得看薯苗育出来的迟早。一般甘薯育苗第一次移栽最早在立夏前六几天，最晚到芒种。因为到这时候秧苗已较为细弱，再以天气炎热，成活不易，栽秧苗就不如插蔓了。
    插蔓的迟早，须待秧苗培育的迟早，近来有人专培植秧，蔓就是将最早栽的秧苗，加意施肥灌溉，可早在芒种即能剪蔓，旱地秧苗则在夏至前后才可能剪蔓。因此插蔓期限制最早不过芒种，最晚可在小暑后几天。俗谓“暑不见薯”就是说到小暑就不要再栽种甘薯了。有的农民在二伏前栽插秧，虽说能结一些，但比种其他作物来就不大合宜了。
    一般的说甘薯无论栽秧苗和插蔓以早栽为佳，因为甘薯的生长期比较长，给他充分时间的发育才能丰收。
