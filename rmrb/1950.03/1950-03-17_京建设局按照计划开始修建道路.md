　　【Beijing News Agency News】In order to facilitate public transportation, connect industrial centers, open up important trunk lines, and meet the needs of the working people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau has formulated this year's road construction plan based on the specific situation and this year's financial situation. The plan emphasizes both maintenance and new construction. In addition to selectively repairing severely damaged asphalt roads, concrete roads, and macadam roads, a portion of new roads will also be built. The new roads planned for construction this year include: the Jingmen Highway connecting the Shijingshan Industrial Zone and the Mentougou Mining Area, the road from Jianguomen to the eastern suburbs industrial area, the East and West Biaobeihutong (east to the industrial area), as well as main roads in the inner and outer city, Beixinqiao to Gulou, Sifabu Street, Old Xingbu Street, Wo Fo Si Street, Chongwai Avenue, Guangqumen to Suanshiko, North and South Gouyan roads, etc. In addition, because a section of Andingmen Avenue is connected to the Chengde National Highway, the traffic volume is very large, and it is also related to promoting trade between urban and rural areas, it was decided this year to change the macadam road to asphalt macadam road, and to expand the road width from eight meters to twelve meters. Another seventeen important hutong dirt roads connecting with the main roads will also be improved, and various low-grade road surfaces such as cobblestones or coal slag will be constructed.
　　After this plan was approved by the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Construction Bureau has started work according to the plan. As of yesterday (16th), construction has started in five places, namely: (1) The reconstruction project of the northern section of Beigouyan macadam road has been completed 80%, and it is expected to be completed in late this month. (2) Andingmen Avenue: The project of changing the macadam road to asphalt macadam road and widening it has now completed 25% of the entire project. (3) The reconstruction of Beixinqiao to Gulou into asphalt macadam road and widening project started on the 8th of this month and is expected to be completed by the end of May. (4) The East and West Biaobeihutong macadam road project has now been completed 99% and will be completed on the 21st of this month. (5) The Sifabu Street asphalt macadam road project started on the 10th of this month and is expected to be completed by the end of next month.

　　京建设局按照计划开始修建道路
    【京市新闻处讯】为了便利公共交通，连系产业中心，打通重要干线，适应劳动人民的需要，京市人民政府建设局已根据具体情况和今年的财政状况，拟定本年度道路工程计划。该计划以保养与新修并重为原则，除将破坏严重的沥青路、洋灰路、石碴路择要修补外，并新修一部道路。今年拟新修的，计有：通石景山工业区及门头沟矿区的京门公路，建国门至东郊工业区道路，东西裱褙胡同（东通工业区）以及内外城干路，北新桥至鼓楼、司法部街、旧刑部街、卧佛寺街、崇外大街、广渠门至蒜市口、南北沟沿等路。此外，安定门大街一段因与承德国道衔接，交通量很大，又与促进城乡贸易有关，今年决由石碴路改为沥青石碴路，并将路宽由八公尺展为十二公尺。另一部与干路衔接的重要胡同土路计十七条亦予以改善，拟修筑为卵石或煤碴等各种低级路面。
    这一计划经北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议通过后，建设局已依照计划展开工作，截至昨（十六）日止已有五处开工，计：（一）北沟沿北段石碴路翻修工程，已完成百分之八十，预计本月下旬即可完工。（二）安定门大街：石碴路改为沥青石碴路及展宽工程，现已完成全工程百分之二十五。（三）北新桥至鼓楼改筑沥青石碴路及展宽工程，于本月八号开工，预计五月底可以完工。（四）东西裱褙胡同石碴路工程，现已完成百分之九十九，本月二十一日即可完工。（五）司法部街沥青石碴路工程，已于本月十日开工，预计下月底可以完工。
