　　Municipal Technical High School Combines Internships with Production
    Improve Skills and Subsidize Internship Costs
    [This newspaper reports] In addition to actively participating in agricultural production, students at the Beijing Municipal Senior Industrial School will engage in industrial production to improve their professional skills and combine theory with practice. The school originally had a mechanical factory and a chemical factory for internships. Last year, combined with their professional internships, students successively produced over 2,800 jin of wrought iron wheels, steam pipe caps, and wrought iron hooks for the Tram Company, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, and private Yonggu Glue Factory and Huatai Chemical Factory, as well as 330 copper gate bases, 2 shredding machines, 2 fans, 1 leather belt, and various other parts and processing jobs. The total profit was nearly 4,900 jin of millet, which solved part of the internship costs; the students also learned a lot of skills from it. This semester, the school does not plan to take outside work for industrial internships. Second and third-year students plan to produce one six-foot lathe for characters and seven nut machines in the mechanical factory; in the paint department of the chemical factory, they plan to produce two tons of fish oil, two hundred boxes of various lead oil, one thousand kilograms of various blended paint, and five hundred jin of various enamel paint (for sale) each month. Through internship production, on the one hand, professional skills can be improved, and on the other hand, part of the internship tools and internship costs can also be solved.
