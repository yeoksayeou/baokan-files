    The representatives rushed over to comfort her. The head of the representatives, Tian Laoda, said: "Liu Guicai will be handed over to the People's Court for trial. His crimes are too numerous; he not only harmed Jin Baoniang's family, but also served as a traitor during the Japanese occupation and as a spy during the Kuomintang era, harming countless people!" Everyone decided to allocate land for Jin Baoniang's family of three and temporarily lend her several dou of grain.

    After the struggle session, Lao Ma was transferred to work in the county. The following summer, a farmer in his thirties or forties, carrying a white cloth bundle, came to look for Lao Ma. When he saw Lao Ma, he asked: "Are you Lao Ma from the work team? I am Jinbao's father." Lao Ma said in surprise: "Wasn't it said that you were dead?" He said: "That year I escaped to work as a long-term laborer for someone, and I didn't make anything after ten years of work. I heard that after the liberation of my hometown, Liu Guicai was overthrown, so I begged my way back." Then he handed the cloth bundle to Lao Ma and said: "This is a pair of shoes made for you by Jin Baoniang; they have also come." Lao Ma refused to take them no matter what, and hurriedly asked: "Where are they?"

    They were almost at the South Gate when they saw Jinbao from afar, standing on a high place and shouting: "Lao Ma! Lao Ma!" Lao Ma walked over and saw Jin Baoniang, her face glowing, wearing a neat set of new clothes. Lao Ma asked them: "How are things?" Jin Baoniang said happily: "We have everything now, we have been allocated a house and land. The crops are growing very well!" She also pointed to the donkey tied under the tree and said: "Look, we even bought a donkey. We owe this good fortune to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for today." ——The End

    金宝娘
    邢琏画
    （根据马烽小说：“一个下贱的女人”）
    （四十八）
    代表们忙过去安慰她。代表主任田老大说：“刘贵财要交人民法庭审判。他的罪恶太多了，不光害了金宝娘一家；日本人在时他当汉奸，国民党时代又当特务，害了多少人啊！”大家决定分给金宝娘三口人的地，并暂时借给她几斗粮。
    （四十九）
    开完斗争会，老马就被调到县上工作。第二年夏天，有一个三四十岁的农民，手里提着白布包，来找老马。他见了老马便问：“你就是工作团的老马吗？我是金宝的爹。”老马吃惊的说：“不是说你死了吗？”他说：“那年逃出去给人家当长工，干了十来年，甚也没闹下。听说家乡解放后，把刘贵财斗倒了，我才讨着饭回来。”随后他把布包遞给老马说：“这是金宝娘给你做的一双鞋，她们也来了。”老马无论如何也没要，急忙问：“她们在那里？”
    （五十）
    他们快到南门跟前，老远就看见金宝，站在高处叫喊：“老马！老马！”老马走过去，只见金宝娘满面红光，穿着整齐一身新衣服。老马问她们说：“光景怎样？”金宝娘高兴地说：“什么都有了，分了房，分了地。庄稼长的也挺好！”又指着树底下拴着的驴说：“你看还买下一头驴。这光景多亏共产党毛主席才有了今天。”       ——完
