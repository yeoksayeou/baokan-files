　　People's Grant-in-Aid Democratic Appraisal Completed at Beijing No. 2 Boys' Middle School

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The democratic appraisal of people's grants-in-aid at Beijing Municipal No. 2 Boys' Middle School was completed on the 13th, 14th, and 15th of this month. Two new methods were created in this review to ensure the smooth and rapid completion of this work. First, find typical cases and hold separate discussions. In the past, when reviewing grants-in-aid, each class adopted the method of grade directors providing guidance and students discussing each applicant one by one. Due to the different political awareness of the students and the different situations of the classes, the appraisal standards for senior and junior high schools were inconsistent, or even different between two classes in the same grade, causing dissatisfaction among the students. Furthermore, if 20 or 30 people in a class applied, it would take a week to discuss each one, and the students would feel tired and bored, with some saying, "My studies have fallen behind; let's finish the appraisal quickly!" This also led to the tendency of being strict at the beginning of the appraisal and perfunctory towards the end. To overcome the above shortcomings, the method adopted this semester was to first formulate a standard by the review committee, divide the applicants in each class into three categories: A, B, and C, write them on the blackboard, and then have each student group select the most qualified and the least qualified for discussion. This gave the students a unified standard, and then they discussed in groups (formed by people in the same dormitory or those who were most familiar with each other). This allowed the discussion to progress from one hour per person to ten minutes per person; at the same time, the standards of each class were the same, and the standards before and after were also the same. Finally, a meeting was held to check the results.

　　Second, in classes with higher political awareness, the method of self-reporting within the group was adopted, that is, three to five relatively familiar students formed a group, and the students in the group helped the applicant understand the situation of other truly needy students, allowing them to compare themselves, and at the same time inspiring the applicant's self-awareness. This method has been tested and is relatively successful. Originally, six students in the third year of senior high school applied, and three of them have voluntarily withdrawn.

　　This review work not only avoided procrastination but also overcame the "leftist" tendencies of the previous semester (such as some classes asking students to sell their watches, bicycles, etc.), and achieved the principle of ensuring that truly poor students receive assistance.

### 京市男二中人民助学金  完成民主评定

　　京市男二中人民助学金
    完成民主评定
    【本报讯】北京市立男二中民主评定人民助学金，已在本月十三、十四、十五三天中完成。这次审评中创造了两个新的方法，使这一工作得以顺利迅速完成。一、找典型，分别集会进行讨论。过去审评助学金时，各班都是采用级主任辅导、同学一一讨论申请人的办法。由于同学的政治觉悟不同，班级的情况不同，而发生了高初中评定尺度不一，甚或同级两班都不同的现象，引起同学的不满。再者，若一班有二、三十人申请，一讨论就得一星期，同学们都有疲乏、厌烦的感觉，有人说：“我的功课都拉下了，快评完得了！”这样也就产生了在评定时前者紧、后者粗枝大叶的偏向。为克服上述缺点，本学期采用的方法，是先由审查委员会拟定一个标准，各班把申请人分成甲、乙、丙三种，写在黑板上，由同学各组中找出一个最合标准的和一个不合标准的展开讨论。使同学有一个化一的标准，再分组进行讨论（由一斋中或比较最熟识的几个人组成小组）。这样可以从一小时讨论一个，进到十分钟讨论一个；同时各班尺度一样，前后尺度也一样了。最后再集会检查一下。
    二、在政治觉悟较高的班级则采取了在小组内自报的方法，即由三、五个比较熟识的同学组成小组，小组的同学帮助申请人了解其他真正困难的同学的情况，让他自己比较，同时启发申请人的自觉性。这个方法经试验是比较成功的。高三原有六个同学申请，其中有三人已自动放弃了。
    这次审评工作不但避免了拖拉现象，同时克服了上学期“左”的偏向（如有的班让同学卖掉表、自行车等），作到了使真正贫苦的同学得到补助的原则。（男二中通讯组）
