Readers' Opinions on This Newspaper

To the Editor:
    After reading "Don't Misunderstand Regularization" by Wang Kejin in the People's Garden on March 19th, I felt it was a reminder to us. Our factory also has some similar biases as he pointed out. However, we have too little experience with regularization, and we hope to introduce several regularized or relatively regularized enterprises. I think this would be a really good thing for those of us who do enterprise work.
  Zhang Xianqin, Shentou Power Plant, Boshan, Shandong

To the Editor:
    Regarding what should be published more in the People's Daily, I collected some opinions, and everyone believes: (1) More news about people's democratic countries should be reported, with systematic introductions; (2) More reports on local situations should be published, especially in newly liberated areas, such as Guangdong and Sichuan; (3) There should be space dedicated to guiding study.
    We are organizing a mass letter-writing campaign to mobilize everyone to write to the People's Daily about their own problems and opinions on the work of government agencies in various aspects.
      Bai Rong, Beijing Fourth People's Education Center

To the Editor:
    I hope the People's Daily will publish more book reviews and articles on methods and experiences in ideological remolding.
    Liu Jinbo, Teacher, Hufangqiao Adult Night School

    --We very much welcome the above suggestions. Comrade Xianqin hopes to introduce the experience of regularized enterprises. Some reports have been published in the past, and we will make more efforts to report them in the future, and we hope that enterprises will write more about their experiences in regularization. We will try our best to publish more articles on discussing learning problems, new book reviews, and texts related to ideological remolding in the future.

专栏：

　　读者对本报的意见编辑同志：
    我读了三月十九日的人民园地作者王克锦的一篇《不要误解正规化》后，觉得对我们是一个提示。我们厂里也有部分类似他所指出的偏向。但我们对正规化的经验太少了，希望能介绍几个正规化的或比较正规化的企业，我想对我们做企业工作的人来说，确是一件好事。
  山东博山神头发电厂张先钦编辑同志：
    对于人民日报应多登些什么东西，我征集了一下意见，大家认为：（一）应多报导些人民民主国家的消息，并作有系统的介绍；（二）应多登些各地情况的报道，尤其是新解放地区，如广东、四川等地；（三）应有指导学习的篇幅。
    我们正在组织群众性的写信运动，发动大家把自己的问题，对政府各机关各方面工作的意见，写给人民日报。
      北京市第四民教馆白融编辑同志：
    我希望人民日报多登一些新书介绍及对于思想改造方面的方法和经验的文字。虎坊桥成人夜校教员刘金钵
    ——对以上的建议，我们非常欢迎。先钦同志希望介绍正规化的企业的经验，过去报上是登过一些的，今后当更努力报道，并希望各企业把自己正规化的经验多多写给我们。讨论学习问题、新书介绍及有关改造思想的文字，今后当尽力多刊载。
      （编者）
