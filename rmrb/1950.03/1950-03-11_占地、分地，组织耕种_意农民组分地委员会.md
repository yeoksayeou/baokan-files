    Italian Farmers Form Land Distribution Committees
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th] The land occupation movement of farmers in southern Italy is expanding daily. According to a Rome dispatch from the Electronegative News Agency on March 2nd: over 30,000 farmers and farm laborers are participating in the land occupation movement. In Calabria, they have occupied 20,000 hectares of uncultivated land. The farmers include not only those belonging to the farm workers' union of the General Confederation of Labor under the leadership of the Communist Party, but also peasant leaders of the Christian Democratic Party. The farmers have also elected representatives to form "Land Distribution Committees" to carry out the work of land occupation, distribution, and organization of cultivation. A TASS dispatch on the 5th, citing the Italian Communist Party's "Unità," reported that sixty "Land Distribution Committees" have been established in the Calabria region. The Land Distribution Committees are composed of ten to fifteen representatives, regardless of political or religious beliefs. This new form of struggle has made the farmers more united and organized.
    Another TASS dispatch on the 5th reported: The Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, has submitted a written inquiry to the government and the lower house, demanding that the government state what steps it intends to take to meet the demands put forward by the Calabria Farm Workers' Union, especially regarding the transfer of landlords' wasteland to landless peasants.

　　占地、分地，组织耕种
    意农民组分地委员会
    【新华社北京九日电】意大利南部农民的占地运动日益扩大，据电通社罗马二日消息：参加占地运动的农民和农场工人共有三万余人，在加拉勃利亚区已占据了二万公顷未耕种的土地。农民们不仅有共产党领导下的总工会的农场工人工会所属的农民，并且也有基督教民主党农民领袖参加。农民们并自己选出代表组成了“分地委员会”，进行占地、分配和组织耕种的工作。塔斯社五日电引意共团结报载：加拉勃利亚区已有六十个地方设立了“分地委员会”。分地委员会由十到十五个不分政治或宗教信仰的代表组成。这个新的斗争形式，使农民们更加团结和组织起来。
    另据塔斯社五日消息：意总工会书记维多里奥已将质问书一件，分别递交政府和下院，要求政府表示打算采取什么步骤，来满足加拉勃利亚农业工人工会所提出的要求，特别是关于将地主的荒地转移给无地农民的要求。
