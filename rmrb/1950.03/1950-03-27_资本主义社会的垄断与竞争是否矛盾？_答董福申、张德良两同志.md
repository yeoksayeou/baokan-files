　　Are Monopoly and Competition Contradictory in Capitalist Society?
　　——A Reply to Comrades Dong Fushen and Zhang Deliang
　　Zhang Yu
　　Regarding the question of whether there is competition within monopoly organizations in capitalist society, you ask whether Xue Muqiao's "Political Economy," page 97, which states, "Thus, competition within the monopoly organization is completely eliminated," contradicts A. Leontiev's "Political Economy," page 116 (page 288 in the cadre reader edition), which states, "Even within monopoly combinations, fierce struggles occur. Although enterprises that previously competed and were hostile to each other are now united in cartels, syndicates, or trusts, they still continue to struggle with each other, only changing the method of struggle. Everyone wants to seize more profits from the jointly operated monopoly organization. The forms of struggle within monopoly organizations are often extremely secretive, and only during particularly tense times is this struggle exposed to the outside world," and Xue's book, page 100, which states, "When capitalist society develops from free competition to monopoly, will competition between capitalists be completely eliminated? Impossible. Monopoly not only does not eliminate competition, but also intensifies it." In my opinion, they are not contradictory.
　　Because, in my opinion, Xue's statement on page 97, "Thus, competition within the monopoly organization is completely eliminated," refers entirely to the "trust" type of the most rigorous monopoly organization.
　　Because the "trust" is a more advanced monopoly organization than the syndicate, that is, the organization of the most rigorous monopoly capital. After the originally independent enterprise organizations join the trust, they completely lose their organizational independence. They form a huge trust, and each organization participating in the trust becomes a member of the trust. Their various organizations are uniformly managed by a board of directors of the trust, that is, the management rights of all enterprises participating in the trust are concentrated and unified in the unified organization of the trust's board of directors. Each originally independent enterprise, after joining the trust, becomes a member enterprise that has lost its independence. Each originally independent entrepreneur now loses the qualification of an independent entrepreneur and becomes a shareholder of the trust. When the trust is established, each receives a certain number of shares, and the trust management bureau distributes profits to the shareholders periodically according to the size of the shares. Therefore, the enterprises participating in the trust, due to its unified management organizationally, cannot have internal competition like syndicates (a syndicate is a joint sales agency established by various enterprises for unified commodity sales; sometimes raw material purchases must also be handled by the syndicate. The enterprises participating in the syndicate only lose their commercial independence, and their production independence is still preserved. Therefore, competition in production can still occur between the enterprises participating in the syndicate, i.e., within the syndicate, and each enterprise must compete for increasing production shares and seizing more profits. As for cartels, they are a lower-level form of monopoly organization. It is only a union of various enterprises in a certain production sector. Each enterprise participating in this union fully maintains its independence, so it cannot eliminate competition, which is even more obvious).
　　However, this does not mean that everything is peaceful within the trust and that there are no struggles. Not at all. Although competition is impossible within the trust, struggles not only exist but are even more intense. The competition between individual entrepreneurs who were originally independent is now concentrated in the struggle among several major shareholders or shareholder giants within the trust for the position of director, supervisor, or member of the board of supervisors of the trust, and it manifests as their struggle for control or leadership of the trust.
　　Therefore, in summarizing "Competition and Monopoly," regarding the characteristics of the entire monopoly organization, A. Leontiev said: "Fierce struggles also occur within monopoly organizations. Although enterprises that previously competed and were hostile to each other are now united in cartels, syndicates, or trusts, they still continue to struggle with each other, only changing the method of struggle. Everyone wants to seize more profits from the jointly operated monopoly organization. The forms of struggle within monopoly organizations are often extremely secretive, and only during particularly tense times is this struggle exposed to the outside world." (Note: The text used in this section has been modified with reference to Zhang Zhongshi's translation of Leontiev's "Elementary Textbook of Political Economy," page 338, so it differs slightly from the translation on page 288 of the Liberation Press edition.) Xue Muqiao also said: "When capitalist society develops from free competition to monopoly, will competition between capitalists be completely eliminated? Impossible. Monopoly not only does not eliminate competition, but also intensifies it." (Xue's book, page 100) This is fundamentally correct, whether from the perspective of within monopoly organizations or between monopoly groups.
　　Therefore, in my opinion, there is no contradiction between Xue's book and Leontiev's book, or between the different sections of Xue's book. Xue's page 97 refers to the internal workings of trusts, while what A. Leontiev and Xue say on page 100 refers to the entire monopoly organization. I wonder what you two think?

　　资本主义社会的垄断与竞争是否矛盾？
    ——答董福申、张德良两同志
    张鱼
    关于资本主义社会的垄断组织内部有没有竞争的问题，你们问薛暮桥著《政治经济学》第九十七页所说“这样，独占（即垄断）组织内部的竞争便完全消灭。”与列昂节夫著《政治经济学》第一一六页（在干部必读版则为二八八页）所说“垄断联合内部，也发生剧烈的斗争。以前互相竞争、互相仇视的各企业，现在虽联合在卡特尔、新迪加或托拉斯里，彼此间仍是继续斗争，只不过换个斗争方法而已。谁都想从合办的垄断组织当中多攫取一些利润。垄断组织内部的斗争形式，往往是极其隐秘的，只在特别紧张时，这种斗争才暴露到外面来。”以及薛著前书一○○页所说“资本主义社会从自由竞争发展到独占的时候，资本家与资本家的竞争是不是会完全消灭呢？不可能的。独占不但没有消灭竞争，且使竞争更加剧烈。”是否矛盾？依我看来，它们是并不矛盾的。
    因为薛著第九十七页所说“这样，独占（即垄断）组织内部的竞争便完全消灭”一节，依我看来，乃是完全指的“托辣斯”这种最严密的垄断组织而言的。
    因为“托辣斯”是比新迪加更加进一步的垄断组织，也就是最严密的垄断资本的组织。原来各自独立的各个企业组织参加了托辣斯以后，就完全失去了它组织上的独立性，它们组成为一个巨大的托辣斯，各个参加托辣斯的组织都变成为托辣斯的一个成员，它们的各个组织都由一个托辣斯的董事会来统一管理，即参加托辣斯的全体企业，其管理权都集中统一在托辣斯董事会的这个统一的组织手里。各个原来独立的企业，参加托辣斯以后就成了失去独立性的会员企业，各个原来独立的企业主，现在失去了独立企业主的资格，变成了托辣斯的股东，他们当托辣斯成立时，各得股票若干，托辣斯管理局就依股份的大小，对股东按期分配利润。因此参加在托辣斯内的各企业，由于它组织上的统一管理，不可能发生像新迪加似的内部竞争（新迪加是各个企业为统一商品贩卖而设立的一个共同贩卖机关，有时原料购买也须通过新迪加之手，参加新迪加的各企业，只丧失它们商业上的独立性，生产上还都保存它们的独立性，所以参加新迪加的各企业间，即新迪加内部仍然可以发生生产上的竞争，各企业都要为增加生产份额更多攫取利润而发生竞争。至卡德尔，它是更低级的垄断组织形式，它只是某一生产部门中各个企业的联合，每一家参加这联合的企业都完全保持着它们的独立，所以它不能消灭竞争，是更显然的事情）。
    但是，这也并不是说托辣斯内部就太平无事，没有了斗争了。完全不是的。在托辣斯内部虽然竞争是不可能了，但是斗争不但存在，而且更为剧烈了。过去各自独立的个别企业家间的竞争，现在集中表现为托辣斯内部几个大股东或股东巨头为了争夺托辣斯的董事或理事监事地位的斗争，表现为他们为了争夺对托辣斯的控制权或领导权的斗争了。
    所以在总结“竞争与垄断”时，就整个垄断组织的特点，列昂节夫说：“垄断组织内部也发生剧烈的斗争。以前互相竞争，互相仇视的各企业，现在虽成立卡特尔、新迪加或托辣斯以后彼此间仍是继续斗争，只不过换个斗争方法而已。谁都要想从合办的垄断组织当中多攫取一些利润。垄断组织内部的斗争形式，往往是极其隐秘的，只在特别紧张时，这种斗争才暴露到外面来。”（按本节应用文字因参照张仲实译列著政治经济学初学读本三三八页，故与解放社版二八八页译文略有不同）薛暮桥也说：“资本主义社会从自由竞争发展到独占时候，资本家与资本家的竞争是不是会完全消灭呢？不可能的。独占不但没有消灭竞争，且使竞争更加剧烈。”（薛著一○○页）这不论从垄断组织内部，或从垄断集团和垄断集团间说来，基本上都是正确的。
    所以薛著与列著间及薛著前后间的说法，依我看来并不矛盾。薛著九十七页是指托辣斯内部而言，列昂节夫所说的与薛著一○○页所说的乃是指整个垄断组织而言的。不知您两位的意见以为如何？
