　　People in the Unliberated Areas of Qiongyai Eagerly Await Liberation
　　·Li Shuo·
　　For the past twenty-three years, the people of Qiongyai have suffered from the persecution, slaughter, and exploitation by the bandit gangs. The flames of resistance have been burning continuously. The people in the vast liberated areas are closely united around the Qiongyai Column of the People's Liberation Army, and are now strengthening their struggle against the remnant bandits to support the People's Liberation Army, preparing with excitement to welcome the arrival of the cross-sea army. The people in the unliberated areas are placing their only hope on the People's Liberation Army.
　　After the liberation of Guangzhou, the defeated bandits fled in a panic to Taiwan and Hainan Island. This group of stray dogs brought another, and final, disaster to the people of Hainan Island. Haikou and all the towns and cities in the unliberated areas are crowded with these fleeing remnant bandits and their families. They seize civilian houses everywhere, occupy schools, and use bundles of "silver dollar notes," which have become worthless paper, to forcibly buy things, using one silver dollar note to forcibly buy ten catties of meat (but actually not even one catty can be bought), and some simply rob. In the villages near Haikou and Wenchang County, Qiongyai, groups of three or five bandit soldiers forcibly dig up peasants' taro and vegetables. The peasants dare not even let the bandit soldiers see leftover food, otherwise it will be snatched and eaten clean. Robberies occur in Haikou city every day, and the streets are filled with stalls, all selling clothes and utensils robbed by the bandit soldiers. The Kuomintang bandit leaders want the bandit army to "rely on its own efforts," openly encouraging their subordinates to rob; the food and drink for the self-defense forces in the bandit township governments are all to be "figured out by themselves." Therefore, the bandit army, whether "regular" or "local," solves its problems by robbing. Last November, the bandit 32nd Army, from Qiongdong County to Wanning and Lingshui, surrounded every city it reached and forcibly robbed the goods of merchants and peddlers. The bandit Guangdong Security Brigade and the bandit 32nd Army and 64th Army openly reaped and stole much of the rice paddies of the people of Wenchang County, Ding'an, and Chengmai during the autumn harvest last year. The "local" bandit army disguised themselves as bandits at night to surround and loot villages, or robbed merchants' property on the road.
　　In addition to open robbery and theft, the bandit gangs exploit the people through various "donations and taxes." In addition to various "regular taxes," the land tax in kind requires the payment of six dou and five sheng of grain per mu, as well as self-government fees, conscription fees, gun purchase funds, "ID card" fees, fortification construction fees, supplementary rice and grain for the security team, supplementary rice and grain for the self-defense force, military uniform money, military shoe money, etc.; recently, they have been issuing "public bonds" on a large scale, with Lingshui County alone being assigned 50,000 silver dollars. The people are forced to sell their land, cattle, horses, and houses to "pay taxes," and those who cannot afford to pay are looted, and after all their belongings are robbed, they are still arrested by the bandit army and ransomed. Whether they have paid the tax or not, the result is always the ruin of their families and the death of their members.
　　The prices of goods in the unliberated areas of Qiongyai are soaring. One silver dollar cannot buy four sheng of rice or one yard of cloth. Due to the obstruction of the remnant bandits, Qiongyai's local products cannot be sold outside, and betel nuts, coconuts, rubber, etc., have fallen to the point where they are not even worth the cost. Those who rely on planting and transporting these local products cannot maintain their livelihoods. Not only do merchants in small cities have no business to do, but even stores in larger cities like Haikou are going bankrupt and closing down. The people refuse to use the silver dollar notes issued by the bandit gangs, and market transactions are all conducted using Hong Kong dollars, silver dollars, and copper coins.
　　In order to make a last-ditch struggle, the remnant bandits are frantically arresting young people in the unliberated areas to serve as soldiers. "Catching pigs" (meaning grabbing people like pigs and dragging them away) happens almost every day. Several people suddenly grab you, cover your head with a sack, and drag you to the bandit's lair, shave your head, put on a military uniform, and you are considered "enlisted." In Haikou alone, five or six hundred students, shop assistants, civil servants, and farmers were captured and "enlisted" in November last year. The bandit 32nd Army surrounded and captured people in the towns of Qiongdong, taking advantage of the bustling market, and escorted them onto bandit ships to Taiwan for "training." In October and November last year, more than 2,000 innocent young people were captured and taken to Taiwan. In the countryside, the bandit local troops surround villages and capture people every night. Those who are unwilling to serve as soldiers have to redeem themselves with money, usually at least one hundred silver dollars, or even five or six hundred dollars. Many people are captured three or four times, resulting in complete bankruptcy. The bandit gangs also force the people in the unliberated areas to build the "Boling defense line," dig trenches, and build fortifications. The people's coconut trees are cut down, the door panels are taken away, and the bricks and tiles that the people bought to build houses are taken away, and they also have to pay a huge sum of "construction fees." In order to "blockade" the coast, the bandit army "requisitioned" many merchant ships and forbade fishing boats from going to sea. Millions of people who live by the sea can no longer go out to sea to fish. Some fishermen who risk going out to sea to fish often have their fishing boats sunk by the bandit army's planes and ships. The bandits also forced the people in the unliberated areas to buy guns, with each village being assigned to buy twenty or thirty to forty or fifty guns, with an average of more than ten silver dollars of "gun purchase fees" to be paid by each household.
　　Under this persecution, the people in the unliberated areas place their only hope on the People's Liberation Army, and they firmly believe that they will soon be liberated. At the end of last year, the Qiongyai People's Liberation Army liberated Lingkou, Nanzha, Wupo and other places in Ding'an County, which were areas long ruled by the bandit gangs, and were referred to by the bandit gangs as "granaries." When the People's Liberation Army arrived, the broad masses of the people were overjoyed to see the strict mass discipline of the People's Liberation Army and the spirit of the People's Government serving the people. During the Lunar New Year, the markets were crowded with liberated people, and they spent their first happy year peacefully.
　　Even under the strict suppression and surveillance of the bandit gangs, the people in the unliberated areas enthusiastically responded to the People's Liberation Army's call for borrowing grain, joining the army, and organizing labor teams, preparing to welcome the cross-sea army. The people in the counties of the unliberated areas sent people to the liberated areas to recognize and borrow large amounts of grain. When they handed over the stolen and transported grain, they said: "We would rather eat taro, but we must give the rice and grain to the army, just to quickly eliminate this gang of bandits." They also actively participated in the labor teams. Three counties organized more than 30,000 labor teams to prepare to serve with the army. Many local elders actively sent their children to join the army. An old gentleman in a certain county heard that there was an opportunity to join the army, and immediately sent his son, saying: "It is time for revenge, do not miss the opportunity." When the peasants are working in the fields, as long as they hear the sound of artillery fire, they are calculating: "It's coming soon! It's coming soon!"

　　琼崖待解放区人民渴望解放
    ·李硕·
    琼崖人民在这二十三年来，受尽了匪帮的迫害、屠杀和压榨。反抗的怒火也一直燃烧着。广大解放区的人民，紧紧地团结在人民解放军琼崖纵队的周围，现在更加强对残匪的斗争来支援人民解放军，以兴奋的心情准备迎接渡海大军的到来。待解放区的人民更是把唯一的希望寄托在人民解放军的身上。
    广州解放后，溃匪狼狈地逃往台湾和海南岛。这一批丧家犬给海南岛的人民带来了又一次也是最后一次的灾难。在海口和一切待解放区的市镇上，挤满了这些逃来的残匪和眷属。他们到处霸占民房，占驻学校，用成捆的成了废纸的“银元券”强买东西，用一元银元券强买十斤肉（实际上还买不到一斤），有的干脆就抢。海口附近及琼崖文昌县的乡村中，匪兵三五成群，强挖农民的莳芋和蔬菜。农民连剩饭剩菜都不敢给匪兵看见，否则就会被抢吃一光。海口市天天都发生抢劫，街上摆满了地摊，全是匪兵抢来的衣服用具。国民党匪首们要匪军“自力更生”，公开鼓励部属去抢劫；各乡匪乡公所中自卫队的吃用，全部是要“自己想办法”。因此，匪军不论是“正规的”或“地方的”，都用抢来解决问题。匪三十二军去年十一月，从琼东县到万宁、陵水，每到一个市就用兵包围起来，强抢商人小贩的东西。匪广东保安旅和匪三十二军、六十四军，在去年秋收期间，公开地抢割了岸县、定安、澄迈人民许多禾稻。“地方”匪军到夜晚就化装土匪围村洗劫，或者是上路抢劫商人的财物。
    匪帮们除了明抢暗劫以外，就是用各种名义的“捐税”来剥削人民。除了各种“正税”外，田赋征实每亩就要缴纳六斗五升谷，还有自治费、壮丁费、购枪款、领“身份证”费、筑堡垒费、保安队附加米粮、自卫队附加米粮、军衣代金、军鞋代金等等；最近又在大派“公债”，仅仅陵水一个县就派了五万银元。人民被迫卖了田地、牛马、房产来“缴税”，交不起的人就被洗劫，东西全部被抢光后，还要被匪军逮捕勒赎。不管是交了税的或没有交的，结果总是落得家破人亡。
    琼崖待解放区的物价更是飞涨不已。一个银元买不到四升米或一码布。由于残匪的阻挠，琼崖的土产无法外销，槟榔、椰子、橡胶等都跌到不够本钱。靠种植和运输这些土产的人，都无法维持生活。不但小城市的商人没有生意可做，就像：海口这些较大城市的商店也纷纷破产倒闭。人民对匪帮发行的银元券都拒绝使用，市场交易都是用港币、银元，铜币。
    残匪为了作最后挣扎，在待解放区疯狂地逮捕青年当兵。各地几乎天天发生“捉猪仔”（就是像捉猪一样的把人抓走）的事情。几个人一下子将你捉住，用麻包盖着头，拉到匪窝里，剃光了头，穿上军衣，就算“入伍”了。去年十一月一个月，海口就有五六百学生、店员、公务员、农民被抓“入伍”。匪三十二军在琼东的各个城镇，都是趁着闹市的时候包围捕捉，捉到就押上匪舰送到台湾“受训”。去年十、十一两个月，就有二千多无辜青年被抓到台湾去。在乡村，匪地方部队每晚都围村捉人。不愿当兵的，只好用款来赎，普通至少要一百银元，甚至要五六百元不等。有不少人被捉三四次，结果弄到完全破产。匪帮还驱使人民筑“伯陵防线”，挖战壕，筑堡垒。人民的椰子树被砍倒了，门板被拿去了，人民买来做屋子用的砖瓦木料都拿走了，还要交出一笔数目巨大的“工事费”。为了“封锁”沿海，匪军“征用”了许多商船，不准渔船下海。千万靠海过活的人民，再不能出海捕鱼。有些渔民冒险出海捕鱼，渔船常被匪军的飞机和舰船击沉。匪徒们还强迫待解放区人民购买枪枝，一个村庄要摊购二三十枝至四五十枝，平均每户人家要付出十块银元以上的“购枪费”。
    待解放区的人民在这种迫害下，把唯一希望寄托在人民解放军身上，他们坚信不久就可以得到解放。去年底，琼崖人民解放军解放了定安县的岭口、南闸、乌坡等地，这些地方是匪帮长期统治的地区，是匪帮们所称的“谷仓”。当人民解放军到来时，广大人民见到人民解放军的严明的群众纪律，人民政府为人民服务的精神，无不欣喜万分。在旧历年关，市上挤满了解放了的人民，他们安安乐乐地过了第一次的快乐年。
    待解放区的人民即使在匪帮严厉镇压监视下，仍热烈地响应人民解放军借粮、参军、组织民工队的号召，准备迎接渡海大军。待解放区各县的人民，派人到解放区认借了大量的粮食。他们交借偷运出来的粮食时说：“我宁可吃莳芋，也要把米粮给大军吃，只求赶快消灭这一帮土匪。”他们还积极参加民工队。某三个县就组织了三万多人的民工队，准备随军服务。很多地方的父老积极送子弟参军。某县一个老先生听说有参军的机会，马上把他儿子送去，并且说：“是报仇的时候了，不要错过了机会。”农民们在田里工作时，只要听见了炮声，他们就盘算着：“快了！快了！”
