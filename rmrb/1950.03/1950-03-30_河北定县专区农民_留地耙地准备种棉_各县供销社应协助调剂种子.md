    Farmers in Ding County Special District, Hebei,
    Reserve Land and Harrow in Preparation for Planting Cotton
    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Counties Should Assist in Adjusting Seed Supply
    [Our Newspaper] Farmers in Ding County Special District, Hebei, are reserving land and harrowing in preparation for planting cotton during the spring plowing season. However, there is a shortage of cotton seeds, which must be prepared as soon as possible. According to statistics from 34 villages in Anguo, Shenze, and other counties, 30,094 mu of cotton fields have been reserved, accounting for 30% to 40% of the total land. To prevent spring drought and retain moisture, farmers in parts of Boye, Li County, Wuji, Anguo, and Anping have harrowed their cotton fields once. Farmers in various regions are preparing seeds. For example, farmers in 32 villages in Shenze, Ding County, Anping, and other counties have prepared 36,211 jin of good seeds. However, this is not enough for the allocation to the reserved cotton fields.

    The three villages of Xiguan in Shenze, Nanliujiazhuang, and Dongxiaofeng have reserved a total of 2,700 mu of cotton land and have prepared 8,500 jin of cotton seeds. According to the required amount, there is still a shortage of more than 4,000 jin of cotton seeds. To support farmers in planting cotton, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Xingtang, Wuji, Li County, Anguo, and other counties have loaned the prepared high-quality cotton seeds to the masses. By the 10th, the Anguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative had loaned 17,350 jin out of its 400,000 jin of cotton seeds. The Li County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also launched a campaign on March 1st for members and non-members to exchange seed cotton for cotton seeds, and has already exchanged 75,000 jin.

    Currently, although preparations for planting cotton have been underway in various counties in the district, in order to ensure the effective realization of the cotton production increase task, it is still necessary to: (1) Strengthen leadership in preparing for cotton planting. According to reports from individual counties to the special commissioner's office, there is a lack of confidence in completing this year's cotton planting task. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of cotton planting preparations during spring plowing, conduct in-depth propaganda, dispel the masses' concerns, and check the cotton planting plans of each village and household, and mobilize Party members and labor models to take the lead. (2) Rapidly prepare cotton seeds and rapidly issue loans. Although cotton seeds have been prepared in various counties, Qu Yang and Shenze still do not have enough for their own counties' needs. Although the special district supply and marketing cooperative has helped the two counties to adjust supplies from Ding County and Wuji, this has not yet been implemented. Most counties have not yet begun to issue loans to the masses. If attention is not paid to improving this situation as soon as possible, it will inevitably be impossible to complete the sowing quantity when the time comes. Therefore, each county should check the preparation of cotton seeds, immediately adjust supplies, quickly issue loans, and mobilize the masses to buy and exchange on their own, so as to successfully complete the preparation of cotton seeds before the Qingming Festival.

### 河北定县专区农民  留地耙地准备种棉  各县供销社应协助调剂种子

　　河北定县专区农民
    留地耙地准备种棉
    各县供销社应协助调剂种子
    【本报讯】河北定县专区农民，在春耕中纷纷留地耙地，准备种棉。但棉籽不足，须及早准备。据安国、深泽等县三十四村统计，已留出棉田三万零九十四亩，占总地数百分之三十至四十。为防止春旱，保持水分，博野、蠡县、无极、安国及安平部分地区，农民已将棉田耙过一遍。各地农民正在准备种籽，如深泽、定县、安平等县三十二村农民，已准备好良种三万六千二百十一斤。但还不够所留棉田的分配。
    深泽西关、南刘家庄、东小封三村共留棉地二千七百亩，已备好棉种八千五百斤，按需要量还差棉籽四千多斤。为扶植农民种棉，行唐、无极、蠡县、安国等县供销社，已将准备的优等棉籽向群众贷发。安国县供销社的四十万斤棉籽，至十日已贷下一万七千三百五十斤，蠡县供销社亦于三月一日起，发动社员非社员用籽棉换棉种，已换出七万五千斤。
    目前，种棉准备在该区各县虽已进行，但为保证增产棉花任务切实实现，还必须：（一）加强种棉准备的领导。根据个别县份向专署的报告，对完成今年种棉任务信心不高。这必须在春耕中，加强种棉准备的领导，深入宣传，打消群众顾虑，并检查各村户种棉计划，发动党员、劳动模范的带头。（二）迅速准备棉籽，迅速贷发。棉籽各县虽已准备，但曲阳、深泽尚不够本县所需。专区供销社虽帮助该两县从定县、无极调剂，但还未执行。大部县份还未开始向群众贷发。这个情况如不及早注意改进，势必到时不能完成播种数目。因此各县应对棉籽的准备加以检查，立即调剂，迅速贷发，并发动群众，自己买换，以便清明节前胜利完成棉籽的准备。
