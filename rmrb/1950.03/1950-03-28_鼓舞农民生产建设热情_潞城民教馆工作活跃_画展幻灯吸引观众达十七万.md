　　Inspire Farmers' Production and Construction Enthusiasm
    Lucheng People's Education Center Actively Works
    Art Exhibition and Slide Show Attract 170,000 Viewers
    [Report from this newspaper] In the past year, the Lucheng County People's Cultural Center in Shanxi Province, in coordination with production and construction and the current central tasks, has launched a variety of cultural propaganda activities in urban and rural areas and has achieved great success. The center was established in early January last year. Thanks to the attention of the leadership and the assistance of all parties, it overcame the difficulties of lack of manpower and material resources, and created a variety of cultural propaganda activities such as slide shows, picture exhibitions, small-scale art troupes, and ballad singing teams, which inspired the production and construction enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. In particular, picture exhibitions and slide shows attracted the most viewers. The center's picture exhibition began preparations in April last year. It hired art teachers from senior primary schools, folk art workers, and students from medical schools to draw 47 current affairs cartoons, production charts, maps of the Liberation War situation, and charts of midwifery hygiene; later, in coordination with the needs of each period, it successively added summer epidemic prevention charts, commentaries on the White Paper and current affairs paintings celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China, "Prevention of Plague," and "Removing the Hat and Weaving Braid" drawings, a total of 40 pictures, plus purchased physiological anatomy charts and those donated by the county committee of the Chinese Communist Party, for a total of 108 pictures. At first, they were exhibited at temple fairs in various districts; after October, they were taken to various rural areas by small-scale art troupes for exhibition. As of January 24 this year, they have been exhibited in the urban area and 54 villages and towns, with 111,186 viewers, equivalent to 93 percent of the county's population. During the exhibition, they were divided into three parts: current affairs, production, and health, and sometimes the agricultural center cooperated to exhibit related agricultural production charts, specimens, and improved agricultural tools, waterwheels, and other physical objects. Each department was equipped with interpreters, or teachers and students from local schools, doctors, and others were invited to serve as interpreters. The exhibition had a great impact on the masses. Each exhibition was very crowded, and the audience patiently listened to the explanations of the interpreters, and some even asked questions for clarification. Some farmers copied down the method of preventing black穗 disease, such as soaking seeds in warm water; in October, the "Living Bottom Carrier," created in this county, was exhibited at the temple fair in the city. Many farmers said after seeing it: "This method is very good. With it, women and children can deliver manure. We must go back and make one." After watching the current affairs exhibition, the farmers reflected: "This is easier to understand than just listening to the newspaper." In particular, many women watched the midwifery hygiene charts several times, which increased their new knowledge of midwifery hygiene.

    The center's slide show began preparations in March last year, and has successively drawn more than 500 slides related to production, current affairs, political education, and health. As of January 24, it has been shown 89 times in the city and 55 villages, with 58,920 viewers. Slide shows in rural areas are highly valued by cadres, some of whom request that they be shown in conjunction with large meetings, and sometimes villages compete to request them to be shown. During the screenings, some county and district cadres helped with the arrangements and served as commentators. The "Bayin Society" and primary school teachers and students in various villages assisted the screening team in adding music and singing, making the slide shows colorful and interesting, which further increased the audience's interest. The masses reflected that watching slide shows is "better than watching a play."

    In order to regularly hold picture exhibitions and show slides in the countryside, the center established a small-scale art troupe in September last year, consisting of six young people with a considerable foundation in literary and artistic work; it also organized folk artists to form a ballad singing team. They all underwent short-term political training and went to the countryside to carry out cultural propaganda work in forms that the masses liked to hear and see, and were welcomed by the masses.

    The staff of the center also used their spare time to renovate the dilapidated houses in the center and established a reading room. The room has more than 400 books and magazines collected, more than ten kinds of newspapers subscribed to or donated by various places, and various charts on current affairs, production, health, and science are arranged according to the season. The average number of people reading in the room every day is about 30, and about 40 books are borrowed.

    In addition, the center assisted the masses in the urban area to organize 30 study groups, established a mass blackboard newspaper, organized a "Lantern Riddles Meeting" during the Spring Festival, and also did some mass service work such as "asking about things" and "writing on behalf of others."

　　鼓舞农民生产建设热情
    潞城民教馆工作活跃
    画展幻灯吸引观众达十七万
    【本报讯】山西潞城县人民文化馆，在过去一年中，配合生产建设和当前中心工作，在城乡各地展开了多种多样的文化宣传活动，获得了很大成绩。该馆成立于去年一月初。由于领导上的重视与各方面的协助，克服人力物力缺乏的困难，创设了幻灯、画片展览、小型文工队、鼓词队等多种文化宣传活动，鼓舞了广大人民的生产建设热情。特别是画片展览和幻灯吸引观众最多。该馆的画片展览于去年四月开始筹备。聘请高小美术教师、民间美术工作者、以及医生学校员生等绘制了四十七幅时事漫画、生产挂图、解放战争形势图和接产卫生挂图；以后配合各时期需要，陆续添增了夏季防疫挂图、评白皮书和庆祝中华人民共和国成立的时事画、“防鼠疫”、“掏帽缏”等图画四十幅，加上购买的和中共县委会赠送的生理解剖挂图等，共已有画片一百零八幅。起初在各区的庙会展览；十月以后，又由小型文工队携赴各地农村展览，截至今年一月二十四日止，曾在城区和五十四个村镇展出，观众达十一万一千一百八十六人，相当于全县人口的百分之九十三。展览时分为时事、生产、卫生三部陈列，有时并由农业馆配合展出有关农业生产的挂图、标本以及改良的农具、水车等实物。各部都配置解说人员，或请当地学校师生、医生等担任解说。展览会对群众影响很大，每次展出都很拥挤，观众耐心地听解释人员的说明，有的并提出问题请求解答。有的农民看了温汤浸种等防止黑穗病的方法之后，特地把它抄记下来；十月间在城内庙会上展览了本县创造的“活底驮”，很多农民看了之后说：“这办法顶好，有了它妇女小孩们都能送粪了。要回去照做一个。”看了时事展览，农民们反映：“这可比光听报纸好懂。”特别是接产卫生挂图，许多妇女连续来看几次，增加了她们许多接产卫生的新知识。
    该馆的幻灯于去年三月间开始筹设，已陆续绘制有关生产、时事、政治教育和卫生等方面的幻灯片五百余幅，截至一月二十四日止，已在城内和五十五个村庄共放映八十九次，观众达五万八千九百二十人。幻灯在农村中，极为干部所重视，有的要求结合开大会放映，有时各村争着要求去放映。放映时，有的县区干部帮助布置并担任解说员。各村“八音会”和小学师生等，协助放映队加配音乐和唱歌，使幻灯有声有色，更增加了观众的兴趣。群众反映：看幻灯“比瞧戏还好”。
    为了经常下乡举办画片展览和放映幻灯等，该馆于去年九月成立了小型文工队，由六名有相当文艺工作基础青年组成；又组织民间艺人成立了鼓词队。他们都经过了短期的政治训练，分赴农村以群众所喜闻乐见的形式进行文化宣传工作，都为群众所欢迎。
    该馆工作人员并以业余劳动整理了破烂的馆内房屋，成立了阅览室。室内有募集的书籍杂志四百余册，由各地订阅或赠阅的报纸十余种，并按季节布置了时事、生产、卫生、科学等各种挂图。每日到室阅览人数平均约三十人，借出书籍约四十册。
    此外，该馆协助城区群众组织了三十个学习小组，建立了大众黑板报，并在春节组织了“灯虎会”，还作了一些“问事”“代书”等群众服务工作。
