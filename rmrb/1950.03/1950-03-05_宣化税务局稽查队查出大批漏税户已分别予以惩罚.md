According to the Chahar Daily News: The Xuanhua City Tax Bureau Investigation Team discovered a large number of tax evasion cases from last year this month and have issued punishments accordingly. Among them, 36 businesses were found to have evaded stamp tax, including Deyisheng Leather Workshop, Jiyuanxiang Grain Store, Lihua, and Xinli Tile and Wood Factory, with a total of 2,938,790 yuan evaded. Deyisheng, Jiyuanxiang, and four other households evaded the most tax. In addition to ordering them to pay the back taxes, the Tax Bureau also imposed fines of 20 to 30 times the evaded amount. The remaining households were ordered to publish confessions in the newspaper and pay the back taxes. 59 businesses were found to have concealed and evaded grain transaction tax, including Yusheng Grain Depot, Jichengyong, and Wanjuxiang, with a total of 2,582.1 shi of grain evaded. Yusheng, Jichengyong, and two other households evaded the most tax and were fined one to five times the evaded amount. The remaining households were ordered to pay the back taxes. In total, 4,029,574 yuan in transaction tax was recovered, and 1,676,864 yuan in fines were collected. This inspection shows that there were many tax loopholes last year. The reason for this is that the tax officials were busy with daily affairs and neglected inspection and anti-smuggling work. This inspection is only the beginning of anti-smuggling efforts, and comprehensive and in-depth work needs to continue.

　　宣化税务局稽查队查出大批漏税户已分别予以惩罚
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报消息：宣化市税务局稽查队，于本月查出去年大批偷漏税户，已分别予以惩罚。其中偷漏印花税者计有德义盛皮坊、集源祥粮行、利华、新立瓦木工厂等三十六家，共偷漏税款二百九十三万八千七百九十元。其中以德义盛、集源祥等六户偷税最多。税务局除令其补税外，并处以二十倍至三十倍之罚金。其他各户令其登报悔过，补交税款。隐瞒偷漏粮食交易税者有裕生粮栈、积成永、万聚祥等五十九家，共有二千五百八十二石一斗粮食漏税。以裕生、积成永等四户偷税最多，均分别处以一倍至五倍之罚金，余下各户令其补税。总计此次共补纳交易税四百零二万九千五百七十四元，缴罚金一百六十七万六千八百六十四元。从这次的检查，说明去年税收漏洞甚多。究其原因，系担任税收的工作人员终日忙于事务，疏忽检查缉私工作所致。这次检查不过是缉私的开始，全面深入的工作尚需继续进行。
