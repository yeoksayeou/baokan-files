　　Production Discipline Lapses, Mine Safety Neglected
    Gas Explosion Occurs in Dalian Well of Longfeng Coal Mine, Fushun, Northeast China
    27 Casualties and Serious Production Losses; Relevant Personnel Have Been Severely Punished

    [This newspaper's report] According to the Workers' Daily, a gas explosion occurred on the 3rd of this month in the Dalian well of the Longfeng Coal Mine in Fushun, Northeast China. All the shoring of 350 meters collapsed, and there were two cave-ins, resulting in the death of 15 workers and injuries to 12 (all new workers). This caused the coal production of Longfeng Mine to drop from 1,500 tons per day to 900 tons, affecting the project progress by one month.

    The accident occurred due to the violation of safety regulations by management and workers, the laxity of production discipline, and disunity among cadres. When the Repair Section of the Engineering Division of the pit sent people to work in newly opened sites, they often did not obtain the consent of the Safety Section, nor did they notify the Safety Section in advance. After inspection, the Safety Section believed that a certain site had high levels of gas and should stop work. They put up a barrier and prohibited passage, but Wang Lianbi, the head of the Repair Section, arbitrarily led workers to remove the barrier and proceed with the work. Furthermore, the Safety Section did not record or report the gas situation according to safety regulations after checking it. Many workers, even the heads of the safety teams, did not understand the safety regulations. Workers could freely enter and exit the pit entrance without any inspection (the bureau ordered that inspections at the pit entrance be strengthened); moreover, the number of people going down each shift was unknown, and it was unknown whether any prohibited items were brought in. Fan Chuanxin, the head of the Engineering Division of the pit, and Wang Shixian, the deputy head, were mutually exclusive. The relationship between Wang Lianbi, the head of the Repair Section, and Zhang Zhenyuan, the head of the Safety Section, and the two heads of the Engineering Division, Fan and Wang, was also poor. The workers were courted by them, forming small cliques.

    In the past, the mine's trade union did not pay enough attention to safety in the pit. The trade union did not systematically educate workers and staff about safety and labor discipline. Before the accident, workers such as Lü Jinting had repeatedly raised concerns with the administration about the excessive amount of gas and the difficulty of operations, but these concerns were not resolved. The trade union was completely unaware of this.

    After the accident, Fan Chuanxin, the head of the Dalian Engineering Division, was dismissed and handed over to the People's Court for failing to stop the violations of engineering regulations and failing to report to higher authorities. Deputy head Wang Shixian and Wang Lianbi, head of the Repair Section, were punished with dismissal and salary reduction. Zhang Zhenyuan, head of the Safety Section, and Liu Ming and Fei Guangtai, the head and deputy head of the Longfeng Mine, each received a major demerit. Zhang Liancai and Zhu Fuhai, the head and deputy head of the safety team, and other relevant personnel each received a minor demerit.

    The person in charge of the Longfeng Mine's trade union is seriously divorced from the masses and should bear considerable responsibility. The issue of punishment is currently under investigation.

    Editor's note: Northeast China's coal mines have made achievements in restoring production in the past three years, exceeding production targets every year. Although there have been improvements in safety issues year by year, the situation is still very serious. In 1949, the seven state-owned coal mines under the Northeast Coal Mining Bureau and the Fushun and Benxi coal mines had a total of 9,229 accidents, resulting in 12,451 injuries and 291 deaths. Among the casualties, the number of deaths caused by gas explosions was the highest. In particular, there have been three major accidents in succession since this year: the gas explosion in the Dalian well of the Longfeng Mine in Fushun on February 3, a responsibility accident, resulting in 27 deaths and injuries; the responsibility accident in the Da Shujian [Great Vertical Shaft] of Benxi on February 5, resulting in 6 deaths; and the accident in the Fuxin Mine in mid-February, resulting in 29 deaths and 15 injuries. The accidents not only caused significant casualties but also greatly affected production.

　　生产纪律废弛忽视矿井安全
    东北抚顺龙凤煤矿搭连井发生瓦斯爆发事件
    伤亡二十七人生产损失严重  各有关人员已受到严厉处分
    【本报讯】据工人日报报导：东北抚顺龙凤煤矿搭连井，于本月三日发生瓦斯爆发事件。三百五十米的棚子全部倒塌，两处冒顶，死工人十五名，伤十二名（都是新工人）。使龙凤矿产煤从日产一千五百吨降低到九百吨，影响工程进度一个月。
    事故的发生，是由于管理人员和工人经常违犯保安规程，生产纪律废弛和干部之间不团结造成的。该坑工程股修理系派人到新开的场子工作时，往往不经保安系同意，事先也不通知保安系。保安系经过检查，认为某场瓦斯大，应停止工作，并钉上栏杆，禁止通行，而修理系长王连壁竟任意率领工人将栏杆撤掉，进行工作。再如保安系检查了瓦斯情况，不记录，不按保安规程报告。更有许多工人，甚至连保安班长也不了解保安规程。工人可以随便出入坑口，毫无检查（局令坑口要加强检查）；而且每班下去了多少人也不知道，有没有带进违禁品也不知道。该坑工程股长范传信和副股长王士贤互相排斥。修理系长王连壁与保安系长张振元，工程股范、王二股长之间关系搞得也不好。工人被他们拉拢，形成小集团。
    该矿工会过去对坑内安全重视也是不够的。工会对工人职员没有有系统地进行安全教育和劳动纪律的教育。事故发生前，吕金廷等工人因瓦斯量过多，作业困难，曾多次向行政提出意见，但没得到解决。而工会对这事则毫无所知。
    事故发生后，搭连工程股股长范传信因对违犯工程等现象不加制止，又不报告上级，已被撤职，交人民法院法办。副股长王士贤，修理系王连壁受到撤职降薪处分。保安系长张振元，龙凤矿正副矿长刘明、费广太各记大过一次。保安班正副班长张连财、祝福海和其他有关人员各记小过一次。
    龙凤矿工会负责人严重脱离群众，应负相当责任，处分问题正在研究中。      
    按：东北煤矿三年来在恢复生产上是有成绩的，每年都超过了生产任务。在保安问题上，虽逐年有改进，但仍很严重。一九四九年，东北煤矿局所属七个国营煤矿和抚顺、本溪煤矿，共发生事故九·二二九次，伤一二·四五一人，死亡二九一人。在伤亡事故中，以瓦斯爆发而死者为最多。特别是今年以来，已连续发生三次大事故：二月三日抚顺龙凤矿搭连井瓦斯爆发，发生责任事故，死伤二十七人；二月五日本溪大竖井发生责任事故，死六人；二月中旬阜新矿发生事故，死二十九人，伤十五人。事故的发生，不仅造成重大伤亡，而且影响生产甚大。
