　　How to Reduce Production Costs?
　　Chernov
　　The cost of production - this is all the capital consumed by various enterprises in manufacturing various products, that is, the cost of production. The cost of a product includes: the value of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity consumed in the entire production; repair costs (wear and tear and repair costs of machines and equipment, repair costs of production buildings); wages paid; workshop and entire enterprise management costs, and the cost of the factory selling the produced products. Therefore, the level of product cost is determined by the degree of rational application of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, the load and use of equipment, the level of labor productivity, the correct establishment of the wage system based on the quality and quantity of labor, and the size of administrative management and daily consumption. Ultimately, the cost level is determined by the extent of savings and the most effective use of funds possessed by the enterprise. The cost of production is a collective concept. It is formed by the sum of the manufacturing costs of individual manufactured goods, that is, each type of product.

　　In the Soviet Union, reducing production costs is the foundation of socialist accumulation of wealth and the most important source of expanding reproduction (that is, production that develops along an upward straight line).

　　In the socialist economy of the Soviet Union, reducing product costs has special significance, because the lower the cost of production, the more funds are liberated in the enterprise and also in the entire country for the expanded reproduction of socialist industry. Therefore, Soviet socialist enterprises are always concerned about reducing costs, or, as it is generally said, are concerned about making a profit (that is, not losing money). By ensuring the rationalization of production, they not only compensate for their consumption, but also obtain the profits stipulated by the plan. The cost of production in industrial enterprises is determined by the level of technology and production organization. Usually, the level of product cost is lower in advanced enterprises with advanced modern technology, and higher in enterprises with outdated equipment, backward engineering processes, and poor labor organization.

　　The conditions that determine the level of product cost and the factors that reduce cost are multifaceted. Any change in the production process will affect the increase or decrease in manufacturing costs. The individual factors that affect the reduction of product cost have different meanings and effects for different industrial sectors. They vary depending on the nature of the expenses used for production. In the most general form, all consumption in all industrial sectors can be divided into: living labor costs (workers' wages) and material consumption, or social labor consumption (this cost in the cost is expressed as the amount of raw materials, fuel, electricity repair costs, etc.).

　　Let us look at the basic factors that affect changes in production costs!

　　　　Labor Productivity
　　The growth of labor productivity is, without exception, the decisive leading factor in reducing costs in all industrial sectors.

　　Reducing costs by increasing labor productivity is only possible when the growth rate of labor productivity is faster than the increase in wages. That is to say, in addition to the increase in the average wage of each worker (daily, monthly, yearly), the wages consumed on each product should be reduced accordingly due to the systematic inspection of outdated production quotas.

　　In socialist countries, working people themselves are concerned about how to improve labor productivity and reduce production costs. They are concerned because they work for themselves, not for capitalists.

　　　　Consumption of Materials
　　With the development of labor technology and equipment, the amount of living labor required is reduced, and the material consumption part in the composition of production costs increases accordingly. The composition of material consumption includes: raw materials, semi-finished products, main materials and auxiliary materials, fuel, electricity, steam, water, machine repair costs, construction equipment costs, and tool damage costs. There are many ways to improve the use of material resources. The main ones are listed below: Reduce the consumption quota of materials for each finished product. For example, reduce the consumption of materials used in the production of ships, carriages, locomotives, lathes, etc.; reduce the consumption of yarn used for each meter of cloth, increase the yarn output of cotton; reduce the consumption of coke used for forging each ton of steel, etc.

　　Reducing the consumption of raw materials per finished product is achieved through changes in engineering processes, due to rationalization or the elimination of waste (saving), and through the improvement of production organization. The quality of raw materials, materials and fuels also clearly affects the improvement of material resource application. For example, coal with less ash and moisture can reduce the consumption of coke in steelmaking production and extend the life of the furnace. Good fiber quality ensures the production of strong threads. With strong threads, it is guaranteed that the weaving machines in the textile factory will work without stopping, and a smaller amount of waste and a reduction in defective products can be obtained.

　　In addition to reducing the consumption quota of raw materials and materials per finished product, significant savings can also be achieved by reducing the various wastes of raw materials and materials. For example, in order to reduce the consumption quota of materials on each machine, in addition to reducing the weight of the machine, significant savings can also be obtained by reducing the waste of materials (shavings, chips), etc.

　　Production does not always stay in one place. Its technology, engineering organization are changing, and the design of products is also changing. All changes in the consumption quota of raw materials and materials for each finished product are generally reflected very late. The quota lags behind life and often appears to be outdated. For example, there are often the following situations: the current quota allows the total test products, that is, unprocessed parts, to be five times, ten times, or fifteen times more than the processed parts. All these various things are completely turned into waste debris, such as shavings and chips. In addition, in order to process these parts, it takes more time, electricity, oil, tools and other things, so it cannot but affect the increase in product prices. Using various necessary metals in this way to make them suitable for a certain size (according to width, narrowness, thickness, length) or a certain style (square, round, angular, and triangular iron, etc.) in order to prepare various parts plays an important role in reducing the consumption of materials and raw materials, and thus affects the reduction of production costs.

　　Reducing costs also relies on reducing losses due to waste in the production process of products, and fighting against defective products, which opens up great possibilities for reducing costs. The Soviet Union has achieved great success in this regard.

　　The level of finished product cost, to a large extent, is governed by the extent to which the so-called waste is rationally used and turned into fully valuable products. Many factories are filled with metal (old factory equipment, various parts, raw material residues, etc.). Factory leaders often do not see the wealth that can be applied to the business.

　　In the waste that falls into the garbage, some materials that can be used to produce daily necessities very smoothly are discarded. Applying these wastes can also increase commodity circulation and help significantly reduce the cost of the main types of production. In individual production, the possibility of replacing precious types of non-ferrous metals with other types of metals and bakelite is a major factor affecting the reduction of production costs. The mutual substitution of raw materials and materials is widely used in Soviet industry.

　　For example, alcohol made from potatoes costs five or six times less than alcohol made from grains. This shows the significance of which raw material is used in the production of each product.

　　Shortening the distance of cargo transshipment and applying local raw materials are of great significance for reducing costs. To facilitate the explanation of this situation, the glass factory of the Sino-Soviet Joint Venture Far East Electric Power Company can be taken as an example. During the Japanese control period, the sand used to supply glass was transported from Japan, because there was no such sand in the Liaodong Peninsula. Now, the factory is made entirely of local sand. Instead of sand, quartz stone is used, which is extremely surplus in the Liaodong area. Obviously, supplying raw materials from other places is inevitably particularly expensive. In this way, I have come to know the most important factors affecting the level of product cost.

　　　　Administrative and Sales Expenses
　　Enterprise management, joint-stock company management, and the sale of manufactured products and the consumption of turning them into currency are also included in the total cost of production. Including direct consumption and factory management consumption in the cost of production is the total factory cost. Adding the expenses of the joint-stock company and sales expenses, then this cost is different from the factory cost, which is called commercial cost. All these management and sales expenses are composed of two types of expenses:

　　A. Includes the supply of administrative management agencies and sales agencies (joint-stock companies, transportation, cargo handling, etc., staff salaries, travel expenses, transportation expenses, etc.).

　　B. Material consumption: office and stationery, materials for repairing office buildings and their repair costs, etc.

　　The issue of the level of management fees must be specifically resolved based on each individual situation. There is no ready-made formula for reducing management fees. The basic principle boils down to the following: the level of management fees on each product must be much lower than other types of expenses. In many cases, although the scale of production has increased, the absolute total amount of administrative management fees must be reduced. This reduction is achieved due to the following circumstances: by streamlining some redundant organizational links, by reducing redundant personnel (removing redundant account reporting, reducing redundant transportation operations, and many other factors). This must save materials and accelerate the turnover rate of commodity production. Roughly calculated, salaries account for 60% of the total management and sales expenses, and material consumption accounts for about 40%.

　　From this, it can be understood that the stricter the enterprise leader treats the reduction of the number of personnel in the management and commercial agencies, the more able he is to reduce the portion of management fees in the general total of the enterprise's production costs.

　　However, external factors not only affect production costs, but their significance is also not small. First, obtaining parts that have already been manufactured from other factories (for example, gearboxes, frames, carriages, motors, etc. in automobiles); second, the price level of raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity, etc. required by the enterprise has changed.

　　Changes in prices and transportation taxes can cause corresponding changes in the production costs of enterprises.

　　All these issues that have been examined are first and foremost to formulate a plan to mobilize the internal reserves of the enterprise. This plan is the organizational and technical plan of the enterprise, and based on this plan, a plan to reduce the cost of production is made.

　　It is also very appropriate to point out that due to the creativity and initiative of workers, employees, and engineering and technical personnel, production costs can be greatly reduced by using the rationalization proposals they put forward. In the Soviet Union, this creative initiative is manifested in the social review and competition of production and labor organization. These reviews provide a large number of rationalization proposals. The implementation of these proposals improves the production efficiency of the enterprise and affects the reduction of production costs.

　　怎样降低生产品的成本？
    契尔诺夫
    生产品的成本——这是各个企业一切消费在制造各项生产品上的资金，也即是生产的费用。生产品的成本包括：消耗在整个生产中的原料、材料、燃料、电力的价值；修理费（机器和装备的耗损和修理费用，生产用建筑物的修理费）；支付的工资；车间和整个企业管理的费用，以及工厂销售所生产的产品的费用。所以产品成本的水平是受原料、材料、燃料、电力的合理化的应用之程度，受载重多少和装备的使用，受劳动生产率水平和按劳动质与量付工资制度的正确建立与否，并受行政管理和日常消费的大小来决定。成本的水平，归根究底，是受企业所拥有的资金的节约和最有效的使用程度来决定的。生产品的成本，是一个集合概念。它是由个别的制成品，也即是由每一种生产品的制造费用的总和所形成的。
    在苏联，降低生产成本，是社会主义积累财富的基础，是扩大再生产（即是沿着上升的直线发展的生产）的最主要的泉源。
    在苏联社会主义经济中，产品成本的降低有特殊的意义，因为生产品成本愈低，在企业中，并且也同样在整个国家里，就有更多的资金被解放出来用于社会主义工业的扩大再生产之上。因此，苏联的社会主义企业，永远是关心降低成本，或是如一般人所说的，是关心赢利（即不亏损）的事情的。靠了生产合理化的保证，他们不仅补偿了自己的消耗，并且得出了计划所规定出的利润。工业企业生产品成本，受技术及生产组织的水平所决定。通常生产品成本的水平，在具有高等近代技术的先进企业里是较低的，而在装备陈旧和工学过程落后以及劳动组织不好的企业里就高些。
    决定生产品成本水平的条件和降低成本的因素，是多方面的。在生产过程中，任何的变动，都会影响到制造费用的增多或减少。影响产品成本降低的个别因素，对于各不相同的产业部门，是有不同的意义和作用的。他们是要看用于生产上的费用的性质如何而变动的。在一切工业部门里的一切消费，在最一般的形态上，是可以划分为：活的劳动费（工人工资）和材料消费，或社会劳动消费（成本中的这种费用，表现为原料、燃料、电力修理费用等等的支额）。
    让我们看看影响生产品成本变化的基本因素吧！
            劳动生产率
    劳动生产率的增长，毫无例外的是一切工业部门中降低成本的有决定意义的主导因素。
    靠提高劳动生产率来降低成本，只有在劳动生产率的增长速度比工资的增加要快时才有可能。这就是说，除了每个工人平均工资（每日、每月、每年）的增加以外，消耗于每件生产品上的工资，应当由于系统的对已经陈旧的生产定额的检查，而随之低降。
    在社会主义国家内，劳动人民自己关心如何提高劳动生产率，并且也关心降低生产品成本。他们之所以关心，是因为他们是为自己而工作，而不是为资本家而工作。
            物材的消费
    随着劳动技术装备的发展，活的劳动的需要量也随之缩减，在生产品成本组成中的物材消费部分随之增加。在物材消费中的组成包括：原料、半制品、主要材料及补助材料、燃料、电力、蒸汽、水、机器修理费、建筑设备费和器具的损坏费等。物质资材使用的改善方法，是有多种多样的。兹将其主要的列举如下：降低每件成品所消耗的物材定额。譬如减少用在船只、车厢、火车头、车床等等生产之上的物材消费；减少用于每公尺纱布上的纺纱消费，增加棉花的纺纱出产；减少锻炼每吨钢所用焦炭消费等等。
    降低每件成品物材消耗额，是经由工学过程改变，是由于合理化或浪费被消除（节约）以及用生产组织的改善的办法而达到的。原料、物材和燃料的质量，也很明显的影响到物质资源应用的改善。譬如，含有灰质水分较少的煤，可以减少在炼钢生产中焦炭的消费，延长熔矿炉的使用。纤维的质量好，就保证出产结实的线。有了结实的线，因而保证在纺织工厂中纺织机上不停的工作，可以得出较少量废物和缩减成品中的废货。
    除了减低每件生产品的原料及物材定额的消耗之外，同时，由于缩减原料材料的各种浪费，也可以达到很大的节约。譬如，为了降低在每个机器上物材消耗的定额，除了减轻机器的重量之外，同时由于物材浪费（刨屑、切屑）等的减少，也可以得到很大的节约。
    生产不是永远停留在一个地方的。它的技术、工学的组织是变动的，制品的设计也是在变动的，一切变动在每件成品的原料和材料的消耗定额里，一般是反映得极晚的。定额是落后于生活的，经常显得是陈旧了。譬如，经常有下列的情形：目前的定额容许全部试制品，即是未加工的零件，比较加工的零件多五倍、十倍、十五倍。所有这各种各样的东西完全变做废屑，类如刨屑、切屑之类。此外，为了对这些零件加工，就要用更多的时间、电力、涂油、工具及其它东西，于是就不能不影响产品价格的提高。这样使用各种必需的金属，使它们适合一定的大小（按宽狭、粗细、长短）或一定的样式（方的、圆的、有角的和三棱的铁等等），以便准备各种的零件，在缩减物材和原料的消费上，起着重要的作用，因而也就影响到生产品成本的降低。
    降低成本，也是靠减少生产品生产过程中由于废货而来的损失，与对废制品进行斗争，这为降低成本开辟了极大的可能性。在这个问题上，苏联获得了极大的成绩。
    成品成本的水平，在颇大的程度上，是要受所谓废屑的合理化使用及使它们变为充分价值的生产品的程度如何所左右的。许多工厂为金属所充塞着（旧的工厂装备、各种零件、原料的残余等等）。工厂的领导者，常常看不到那些可能应用到事业中去的财富。
    在落于垃圾中的废屑里，被抛弃着一些可以很顺利的生产出日用品的材料，应用这些废屑，还可增加商品流转，也可以帮助显著降低生产品主要种类的成本。在个别生产中，用别的金属种类，电木代替有色金属的贵重的种类的可能性是影响生产成本降低的重大因素。原料，材料的互相代替，在苏联工业里是被极广泛的采用着。
    譬如，从马铃薯中制出的酒精，就比从五谷中制出的酒精成本要低五、六倍。由此可见，在每个生产品生产中，采用那一种原料，是有着怎样的意义。
    缩短货物转运的距离和应用本地原料，对降低成本有着重要的意义。为了便于解释这种情况，可以举中苏合营远东电业股份公司的玻璃厂为例。在日本统制时期，供应制玻璃的砂是从日本运来的，因为在辽东半岛没有这种砂子。在现在，工厂则是完全用本地砂子做的。代替砂子的，是利用石英石，这种石头在辽东区内是极为过剩的。很显然的，从其它地方来供应原料，是难免要特别贵的。这样，我就认识了影响生产品成本水平的最重要的因素。
            行政管理和销售费用
    企业管理，股份公司的管理，以及制成品的销售和变成货币的消费，也是包含在整个的生产品成本之内的。将直接消费及除此之外的工厂管理之消费，包括在生产品成本之中，就是全工厂的成本。再加上股份公司的费用及销售费，那末这种成本，就与工厂成本有区别，这叫做商业成本。所有这些管理费及销售费是由两种费用组成的：
    甲、包括行政管理机构和销售机关的给养（股份公司、运输、货物装卸等等，工作人员薪俸，出差费、舟车费等等）。
    乙、物材的消费：事务和办公文具、修理办公处建筑的物材和它的修理费等等。
    管理费的水平问题，必须根据每个个别的情况来具体的解决。降低管理费的现成公式是不存在的。基本的原理归结如下：在每件生产品上的管理费水平，一定比其他种类的费用大大的低。在许多情形下，虽然生产规模增大了，行政管理费的绝对总额却必须降低。这种降低，是由于下列情形而达到的：用精简掉一些冗赘的机关环节，用缩减冗赘的人员（去掉多余的帐目呈报，减少多余运输的运转以及其它许多的因素）。这件事一定能节省资材和加速商品生产率的周转率。大概算起来，管理费和销售费总额之中，薪俸占百分之六十，物资消费约占百分之四十。
    由此可以明白，企业领导者愈是严格对待缩减管理机关和商业机关的人员数额，就愈能够降低该企业生产品成本一般总数中的管理费的一部分。
    但是，外界的因素不仅影响生产品成本，其意义也是不小的。第一、从其他工厂获得早已制造好了的零件（譬如，汽车中的变速器、框架、车箱、马达等）；第二、企业所需的原料、材料、燃料、电力等等价格水平起了变化。
    价格和运输税的变更，可以引起企业生产品成本相应的变更。
    所有这些被考察了的一系列问题，首先是要拟制一个动员企业内部后备力量的方案。这个方案，就是企业组织上和技术上的计划，根据这个计划再制出降低生产品成本的计划。
    指出下列的事情也是很应当的，即由于发挥工人、职员、工程技术工作人员的创造的积极性的结果，经由利用他们提出的合理化建议的办法，也可以使生产品成本大为降低。在苏联，这个创造的积极性，表现在生产和劳动组织的社会检阅里和竞赛里。这些检阅提供了大量的合理化建议。这些建议的实现，就提高了企业的生产效能，并影响到生产品成本的降低。
                                                  （张泽民译）
