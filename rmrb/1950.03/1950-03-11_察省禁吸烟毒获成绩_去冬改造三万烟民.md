Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th: The people's governments at all levels in Chahar Province have achieved success in reforming smokers by adopting methods that enlighten smokers' awareness, combined with strict administrative management and education. In the past, as a result of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and the Japanese imperialists' policy of poisoning and narcotizing the people, a total of about 100,000 people in the province became addicted to opium. Since the beginning of last winter, various parts of the province have launched a campaign to reform smokers in conjunction with winter production. According to incomplete statistics, more than 30,000 smokers have been reformed. From November of last year to the beginning of January of this year, Ying County established a total of 150 opium cessation centers. Among the 870 people who entered the centers to quit smoking, 552 have already quit and left the centers to participate in agricultural production. The methods used in various places to reform smokers generally involve recalling and calculating the differences in life and status before and after smoking, enlightening smokers' awareness, and enabling them to voluntarily reform themselves. Cadres of the work team in Guqianpu Village, Yangyuan County, mobilized Zhao Cai and other four people who were determined to quit smoking to explain the harms of smoking with their own experiences at the village's general meeting of smokers and their determination to reform with the help of the government. At the meeting, they initiated the establishment of an opium cessation center, and 27 people immediately signed up to enter the center to quit smoking. After entering the center, on the one hand, they themselves discussed and formulated the discipline for quitting smoking, stipulating guarantees not to steal or eat tobacco, not to leave the center casually, etc. On the other hand, cadres of the work team mobilized the families of smokers to go to the opium cessation center to persuade and provide spiritual encouragement to the smokers, prompting them to be determined to quit. Currently, 48 smokers in the village have successfully quit and left the center.

　　察省禁吸烟毒获成绩
    去冬改造三万烟民
    【新华社张家口九日电】察哈尔省各地人民政府由于采取启发烟民觉悟，结合严格的行政管理和教育的方法，改造烟民工作获得成绩。该省过去由于国民党反动统治和日本帝国主义实行毒化麻醉政策的结果，共约有十万人染上了吸食鸦片的不良嗜好。去年入冬以后，该省各地结合冬季生产，掀起了改造烟民的运动。据不完全统计，已改造烟民达三万余人。应县从去年十一月至今年一月初，共成立戒烟所一百五十处，入所戒烟的八百七十人中，已有五百五十二人戒绝出所，参加农业生产。各地改造烟民的方法，一般是用回忆和算账来比较吸烟前后生活和地位，启发烟民觉悟，使其自愿地改造自己。阳原县谷前堡村工作组干部，发动决心戒烟的赵才等四人，在全村烟民大会上以亲身经历的事实说明吸烟的害处，和在政府帮助下进行改造的决心。会上即发起成立戒烟所，当场就有二十七人自动报名入所戒烟。戒烟者入所后，一方面由他们自己商定戒烟的纪律，规定保证不偷烟吃、不随便出所等。另一方面由工作组干部发动烟民家属到戒烟所进行规劝和精神上的鼓励，促使烟民决心戒绝。现该村已有四十八个烟民戒净出所。
