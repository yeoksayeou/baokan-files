　　A New Era for Financial and Economic Work
    Remembering the National Financial Conference in February
    Chang Jiang

　　The National Financial Conference in February was a historic meeting for China's financial and economic work. From then on, our financial and economic work entered a new era, that is, a new era from decentralized management to basically centralized and unified management. After the establishment of the Central People's Government on October 1 last year, various units under the Financial and Economic Commission of the State Council held a series of professional meetings, enabling the Central People's Government to have a basic understanding of all aspects of the national financial economy. The February meeting was a summary of this series of professional meetings. In the words of Comrade Chen Yun, it was "the finishing touch."

　　The financial and price situation in January this year was better than in the same period last year. However, the financial expenditure in that month exceeded the figure predetermined in the 1950 budget, and the financial revenue in that month failed to collect according to the budget. Due to this situation, coupled with the fact that most of the national income is in the hands of local governments at all levels, payment is inconvenient, and the issuance of national currency has to be increased. If this situation continues, the financial deficit will increase substantially, and new major fluctuations will occur in finance and prices, which will have extremely adverse effects on our national economy and people's lives. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council decided to take serious steps to change this situation. From February 13th to 25th, the Financial and Economic Commission convened a national financial conference to discuss how to solve this financial difficulty. The "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" and other relevant decisions passed by the State Council of the Central People's Government on March 3 are the results of the National Financial Conference in February.

　　The decision of this financial conference is fully in line with the greatest interests of the people of the whole country, because it guarantees the most important demands of the people of the whole country in 1950 in terms of finance and economy. What are the most important demands of the people of the whole country in 1950? The first is to liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island and Tibet, to complete the liberation of the whole country and realize peace throughout the country. The liberation of Taiwan is of great importance to the economic recovery of the southeastern coastal provinces and the Yangtze River area. The conference decided to give sufficient guarantees for this war expense. The second is to guarantee the living and working expenses of approximately nine million military and government personnel nationwide. The reason why there are so many military and government personnel is because it includes a large number of people from the old army and old agencies. It is Chairman Mao's brilliant policy to take over the old army and old personnel as a whole and gradually educate and transform them so that they can gradually shift to production. It is completely correct and must be resolutely implemented. There is no doubt that feeding 9 million people is a huge financial burden, but it is a burden that must be borne. The national finance must bear it. The third urgent task is to transport grain for disaster relief and fully guarantee the supply of food to major cities. The fourth task is to focus on restoring economic and cultural undertakings. The conference made sufficient plans for these tasks. The method to accomplish the above four tasks is not to take the path of "vicious inflation" that the enemy hopes for, but to strive for a rough balance of financial revenue and expenditure and a rough stability of finance and prices. The conference repeatedly discussed how to solve the problem of balancing financial revenue and expenditure, balancing currency withdrawal and issuance, and balancing supply and demand of materials, and the results of the research showed that these three balances are all possible.

　　Where does the possibility of achieving these three balances lie? It exists in the fact that expenditures can still be saved, revenues can still be rectified, and the basic condition for guaranteeing the above two – unifying the national financial revenue and expenditure management – has also become possible.

　　Where else can expenditures be saved? If the falsely estimated and falsely reported number of people is verified, if people who can be separated from production can return to production as much as possible, and if things that can be postponed can be postponed as much as possible, it is entirely possible to reduce considerable expenses. In terms of revenue, what else can be rectified? If the public grain is guaranteed to be collected, and the tax revenue, which accounts for more than half of the national financial cash expenditure, can be handled conscientiously, all state-owned enterprises will collect industrial and commercial taxes and recover a certain profit, all state-owned factories will recover depreciation fees, and the national warehouses will be carefully cleared, this will exceed the 1950 financial budget revenue forecast. To implement the above two points, it is necessary to unify the national financial and economic work. Can it be done? Everyone feels that it can be done: First, our country is a people's country led by the Communist Party, and there will be no feudal separatism in politics. All local people's governments unconditionally support the Central People's Government; second, we already have relatively convenient transportation conditions, which are enough to connect most areas relatively closely; third, our financial and economic work has already been unified in terms of policies, monetary system, tax laws, etc., so there is a basis for further unifying revenue and expenditure now.

　　The conference fully estimated the difficulties in implementing the unified national financial and economic work. Difficulties may come from three aspects: First, some localities and departments may demand more expenditures, because they want to do many things, that is, they want to "revive everything," which contradicts the requirement of saving expenditures. Second, some people advocate not collecting taxes or collecting less taxes, because they have abstract "benevolent government" views, which contradicts the rectification of income. Third, some localities and some departments require more "flexibility" in their economy, which contradicts the requirements of centralization and unification. Moreover, there are indeed some small difficulties in the work progress when switching from long-term decentralization to unification immediately. Therefore, some people who are familiar with the financial history of old China doubt whether we can overcome these difficulties in a short period of time to implement the unified plan. The conference resoundingly answered their doubts: The central and local people's governments led by the Communist Party can completely achieve this unity; all opinions that are not in line with the central government's new financial policy can be completely convinced.

　　The decision of the February meeting was very solemn. Before making the final decision, the representatives carefully studied the basic situation of the national financial revenue and expenditure, trade, food, finance, and other aspects, as well as the political and military situation related to this. Not only the general situation was studied, but also the situation of each region, each major issue, and even the cash revenue and expenditure of each quarter and each month was studied. The decision of the conference was based on these basically accurate calculations.

　　The representatives of the conference, the financial leaders of the major administrative regions, went back after "slapping the board" like concluding a deal at the exchange. However, although they "slapped the board," everyone knew that things were not easy, and what followed would be a struggle, a tense struggle to turn possibility into reality. However, the financial leaders of various places are very confident in the conference's decision. They said: "Only by doing this can the problem be completely solved."

　　The representatives are responsible for the results of the meeting. The facts of the past half month are: all parts of the country have been acting to implement the correct resolutions of the February meeting.

　　财经工作的新时期
    追记二月全国财政会议
    长江
    二月全国财政会议是新中国财政经济工作的历史性的会议。从此以后，我们的财经工作进入了一个新时期，即由分散经营到基本上集中统一的新时期。去年十月一日中央人民政府成立以后，政务院财经委员会所属各单位曾经举行过一系列的专业会议，使中央人民政府对于全国财政经济各方面的情况有了基本的了解，二月会议则是这一系列专业会议的总结，照陈云同志的话，则是“画龙点睛”。
    今年一月的金融物价情势，比去年同期为好。但是，这一月的财政支出，却超过了一九五○年概算中所预定的数字，而这一月的财政收入则未能按概算收齐。由于这种情况，加以国家收入大部掌握在各级地方政府手中，支付不便，国家通货的发行不能不增加起来。如果让这种情况继续下去，财政赤字就会大量增加，金融物价就会发生新的大波动，我们的国家经济和人民生活，都会遭受极端不利的影响。政务院财经委员会决定采取严重的步骤来转变这种局面。从二月十三日至二十五日，财经委员会召集了全国财政会议，来讨论如何解决这一财政困难问题。三月三日中央人民政府政务院通过的“关于统一全国财政经济工作的决定”及其他有关决定，即是二月全国财政会议的结果。
    这次财政会议的决定，是完全符合于全国人民最大利益的，因为，它在财政经济上保证满足全国人民在一九五○年最主要的要求。全国人民在一九五○年最主要的要求是什么呢？首先是解放台湾、海南岛和西藏，以完成全国的解放，实现全国的和平。台湾的解放，对东南沿海各省及长江一带的经济恢复关系很大。会议对于这一项作战费决定给以充足的保证。第二是保证全国大约九百万军政人员的生活与工作费用。军政人员之所以有这样多，是因为这里面包括了由旧军队旧机关过来的一个不小的数目。对于旧军队旧人员一概包下来，逐步加以教育改造，使之逐步转入生产，这是毛主席的英明政策，是完全正确和必须坚决执行的。毫无疑义，九百万人吃饭是一个巨大的财政负担，然而这是非有不可的负担。全国财政所必须负担的。第三个迫切任务是运粮救灾，与充分保证各大城市粮食的供给。第四个任务是有重点地恢复经济与文化事业。会议对于这几项任务都作了足够的筹划。完成上述四项任务的方法，不是采取敌人所盼望的“恶性通货膨涨”的道路，而是以力争财政收支大体平衡与金融物价大体稳定为条件的。会议曾经反复讨论如何解决平衡财政收支、平衡通货吐纳、平衡物资供求的问题，而研究的结果认为这三种平衡都可能作到。
    达到这三种平衡的可能性存在在什么地方呢？存在于支出还可能节约，收入还可能整顿，而保障上述两者的基本条件——统一全国财政收支管理,也已经有可能实现。
    支出方面还有什么可以节约呢？如果把虚估与虚报的人数核实了，能够不脱离生产的人尽可能回到生产中去，而且把可以缓办的事尽可能缓办，减少相当大的开支是完全可能的。在收入方面，还有什么可以整顿呢？如果公粮保证收齐，而占全国财政现金支出一半以上的税收，能认真办理，公营企业一律收工商业税，并收回一定利润，公营工厂一律收回折旧费，又仔细清理全国的仓库，这就可以超过一九五○年财政概算的岁入预计。要实行上面两条，必须统一全国财政经济工作。能不能办到呢？大家觉得可以办到的：第一，我们的国家是共产党领导的人民国家，在政治上不会有封建割据，各个地方人民政府都是无条件拥护中央人民政府的；第二，我们已有相当便利的交通条件，足以把绝大部分地方比较密切地联系起来；第三，我们的财经工作已经在政策、币制、税法等方面统一起来了，所以现在进一步把收支统一起来是有基础的。
    会议曾经充分估计到实行统一全国财政经济工作的困难。困难可能来自三个方面：第一，有些地方和部门可能要求多开支，因为他们想办很多事，就是想“百废俱兴”，这就与节约支出的要求相矛盾。第二，有些人主张不收税或少收税，原因是他们有抽象的“仁政”观点，因而与整顿收入相矛盾。第三，有些地方和有些部门要求自己在经济上多“机动”，因而与集中统一的要求相矛盾。而且从长期分散立刻转到统一，在工作进度上的确存在一些小困难的。因此，有些熟悉旧中国财政历史的人，怀疑我们能否在短期内战胜这些困难，来贯彻统一的方案。会议响亮地回答了他们的疑问：共产党领导的中央与地方人民政府是完全可以实现这种统一的；所有与中央新财政政策不相符合的意见，都是完全可以说服的。
    二月会议的决定是很郑重的，在未作最后决定前，代表们仔细地研究了全国的财政收支、贸易、粮食、金融等各方面的基本情况，以及与此有关的政治军事情况。不仅研究了大体的情况，而且研究了每一个地区、每一个主要问题、以至于每一季每一月的现金收支情况。会议的决定，是以这些基本上确实的计算为基础的。
    会议代表们，各大行政区的财政负责人，是和交易所成交一样“拍”了“板”回去的。不过，他们虽然“拍”了“板”，谁也知道，事情并不是轻而易举的，跟着来的将是一场斗争，一场变可能性为现实性的紧张的斗争。然而，各地财经负责同志对会议决定都很有信心。他们说：“只有这样做，才能彻底地解决问题。”
    代表们对于会议的结果是负责的。半个月来的事实是：全国各地已经在纷纷为实现二月会议的正确决议而行动起来了。
