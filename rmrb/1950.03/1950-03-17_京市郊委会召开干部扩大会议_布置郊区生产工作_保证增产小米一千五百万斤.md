Beijing News Agency Report: The Beijing Municipal People's Government Suburban Work Committee, in order to launch the agricultural production campaign in the Beijing suburbs this year, began holding an expanded meeting of district and village cadres from yesterday (the 16th) to deploy and discuss suburban production work for this year. The meeting is scheduled for three days. Yesterday was the first day of the conference, with over 1,200 attendees, including district and village cadres from various districts, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Municipal Cooperative, and the Municipal Cooperative Bank of the Central People's Government. The meeting was presided over by Zhou Fengming, Director of the Municipal Suburban Work Committee. Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended, provided guidance, and delivered a report to the conference. It was announced at the meeting that the agricultural production task for the Beijing suburbs this year is to "increase production by 10% on the existing base," which requires the entire suburbs to produce 170,437,333 jin of millet this year. This will bring the total output of the existing 1,044,978 mu of cultivated land in the suburbs to an increase of 15,494,303 jin of millet compared to the normal total output (154,943,030 jin of millet). The specific tasks for completing the production increase are as follows: 1. Organize labor mutual aid. 2. Universally develop supply and marketing cooperatives. 3. Strengthen sideline production. 4. Build water conservancy projects, increase irrigation, and prevent floods. 5. Increase the application of fertilizer. 6. Promote improved varieties. 7. Protect and increase livestock. 8. Launch a mass pest control campaign. 9. Solve the difficulty of some farmers lacking agricultural tools and promote new agricultural tools. 10. Provide loans to solve the difficulties of some farmers lacking seeds, draft animals, and food.

In his report, Chai Zemin pointed out that the plan formulated by the Municipal Suburban Work Committee was developed after repeated research and multiple revisions by relevant parties, and it possesses the conditions for successful completion. However, the main issue remains that all cadres in the suburbs should systematically lead the liberated farmers, unite people from all walks of life in the suburbs to overcome difficulties, and make every effort to mobilize and organize themselves to guarantee the completion of this overriding central task of 1950—production! Chai Zemin also gave a detailed explanation of each of the ten specific tasks, emphasizing that organizing labor mutual aid is the basic direction for our leadership of rural production because this can improve productivity and gradually guide the scattered individual economy towards collectivization. However, the principles of voluntariness and equivalent exchange must be firmly grasped when organizing labor mutual aid. Supply and marketing cooperatives are a good bridge for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and we must massively and universally develop them this year to strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance. Finally, he called on Communist Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres to play a leading role in the production campaign, just as they do in any other work, and strive to be production models. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. Today, district and village cadres from various districts will conduct discussions in their respective districts.

    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会为了开展今年京郊农业大生产运动，特自昨（十六）日起召开郊区区、村干部扩大会议，布置与讨论今年郊区生产工作。会议定期三天。昨为大会第一日，出席各区区、村干部及中央人民政府农业部、水利部、市合作社、市合作银行等单位代表共一千二百余人。会议由市府郊委会主任周凤鸣主持。中共市委会郊委书记柴泽民出席指导并向大会作了报告。会上宣布了今年北京市郊区的农业生产任务是“在现有基础上增产一成”，即要求全郊区今年生产小米一亿七千零四十三万七千三百三十三斤，使全郊区现有耕地一百零四万四千九百七十八亩的总产量较常年总产量（小米一亿五千四百九十四万三千零三十斤）增产小米一千五百四十九万四千三百零三斤。完成增产任务的具体工作有下列十项：一、组织劳动互助。二、普遍发展供销合作社。三、加强副业生产。四、兴修水利、增加灌溉并防止涝灾。五、增施肥料。六、推广优良品种。七、保护与增添牲畜。八、开展群众性的除虫防害运动。九、解决部分农民缺乏农具的困难，推广新农具。十、发放贷款解决部分农民缺乏种籽、耕畜与食粮的困难。柴泽民在报告中指出：市府郊委会所制定的这个计划是经过有关方面反复研究、多次修改后所制定的，它具备着胜利完成的条件；但主要的问题仍在郊区全体干部应有计划地领导翻了身的农民，团结郊区各阶层人民克服困难，尽一切努力动员起来，组织起来，来保证完成这一九五零年的压倒一切的中心任务——生产！对于十项具体工作，柴泽民也逐项作了详细的说明，并着重指出组织劳动互助是我们领导农村生产的基本方向，因为这样作可以提高生产力，可以把分散的个体经济逐步导向集体化，但是组织劳动互助时必须切实掌握自愿等价的原则。供销合作社是城乡物资交流的良好的桥梁，今年我们一定要大量的普遍的加以发展，以加强城乡互助。最后他号召共产党员、青年团员与村干部在生产运动中也要像在其他任何工作中一样起带头作用，争取作生产模范。会议于下午四时休会。今日各区区、村干部分别在各该区进行讨论。
