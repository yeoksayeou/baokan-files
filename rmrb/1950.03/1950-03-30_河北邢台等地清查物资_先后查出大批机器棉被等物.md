In order to overcome national financial and economic difficulties, the Xingtai Special Office in Hebei Province began to carry out inventory work on old materials in mid-February and has discovered a batch of materials. As of now, according to statistics from Xingtai Chengguan District, Wei County, Longyao, and Neiqiu alone, a total of 11 sewing machines, 3 boxes of machine parts, 3 cotton gins, 6 diesel engines, 2 English typewriters, and many other clothing and utensils have been cleared out. The value of these items can be converted to more than 70,000 catties of rice. Recently, Hou Louzi Village in Xingtai County cleared out 200 cotton quilts, and Beizu Village in Shahe cleared out 1,521 catties of old cotton wadding. Other counties are also carrying out inventory work and plan to conduct a major inspection of "buried materials" in April. (Hua, Zhen, Fei)
