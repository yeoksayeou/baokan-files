Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 19th: The first Hubei Provincial Farmers' Representative Congress was held in Wuchang from March 5th to 15th. A total of 964 farmer representatives from various regions attended. Lin Biao, Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, and Zhang Nanxian, Vice Chairman, both attended and delivered speeches. Li Xiannian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, also attended to participate in the guidance. At the meeting, representatives from various regions listened to reports from leaders of the Central-South Region and Hubei Province, clearly understood the current situation and the principles and tasks of the peasant movement, and conducted thorough discussions in conjunction with the experience of rural work in various regions. The congress elected Liu Jianxun, Deputy Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Cheng Tan, the former director of the preparatory committee of the Farmers' Association, and 75 others as executive members of the Hubei Provincial Farmers' Association, formally establishing the Hubei Provincial Farmers' Association. The congress also adopted the organizational charter of the Farmers' Association and the resolution of the Farmers' Representative Congress. The resolution of the congress pointed out that the rural areas of Hubei are currently in a season of spring famine and spring plowing, and the vast number of farmers are affected by the lack of food, which affects the smooth progress of spring plowing and production. In order to overcome the spring famine and do a good job in spring plowing, the primary task of farmers throughout the province is to widely carry out the rent reduction movement, and at the same time, vigorously organize farmers to carry out spring plowing and production, and respond to the call of the Hubei Provincial People's Government to increase grain production by ten catties per *dou* of land (*dou* is a unit, referring to the land using one *dou* of seeds). The resolution believes that universally and rapidly organizing farmers throughout the province is a basic condition for farmers to stand up. Before the autumn harvest this year, the province should develop six million male and female Farmers' Association members to strengthen the ranks of farmers, and through the Farmers' Association, transform the rural grassroots government, establish militia armed forces, so as to thoroughly realize the people's democratic dictatorship, suppress counter-revolutionaries, protect the vested interests of farmers and defend production. The resolution calls on farmers throughout the province to strive to improve their political consciousness and organizational level, and actively prepare for the land distribution reform movement after the autumn harvest this year.

    【新华社汉口十九日电】湖北省首次农民代表大会于三月五日至十五日在武昌举行。出席各地农民代表共九百六十四人。中南军政委员会主席林彪、副主席张难先都到会讲话。湖北省人民政府主席李先念亦到会参加指导。会上，各地代表们听取了中南区和湖北省各领导机关首长的报告，明确认识了目前的形势和农民运动的方针和任务，并结合各地农村工作的经验进行了充分的讨论。大会选出了中共湖北省委副书记刘建勋、原农民协会筹委会主任程坦等七十七人为湖北省农民协会执行委员，正式成立了湖北省农民协会。大会并通过了农民协会的组织章程和农民代表大会的决议。大会决议指出：目前湖北农村正处于春荒与春耕季节，广大农民因缺乏粮食而影响了春耕生产的顺利进行。为了渡过春荒、做好春耕工作，全省农民当前的首要任务是广泛地开展减租运动，同时应大力组织农民进行春耕生产，响应湖北省人民政府每斗田（单位，即使用一斗种籽的土地）增产十斤粮食的号召。决议认为：普遍迅速地把全省农民组织起来，是农民翻身的基本条件，在今年秋收前，全省要发展六百万男女农民协会会员，以壮大农民的队伍，并通过农民协会改造乡村基层政权，建立民兵武装，以彻底实现人民民主专政，镇压反革命分子，保护农民的既得利益和保卫生产。决议号召全省农民努力提高自己的政治觉悟与组织程度，积极准备今年秋收后的分配土地的改革运动。
