　　We Vote
　　·By Ehrenburg·
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th] TASS Moscow dispatch: The Pravda published on the 12th a thesis by the famous writer Ehrenburg entitled "We Vote," stating: On March 12th, the Soviet people voted for the honor, independence, and freedom of their motherland. Our people will never live according to the orders of foreign countries. It is futile for Mr. Truman to try to intimidate us, and it is also futile for Mr. McMahon to try to bribe us. The energy of our people has been tested by steel, and this test was not in meetings, not in sports competitions, nor in reviews, but in the battles of Rzhev, Leningrad, Stalingrad, the Dnieper River, and the Oder River. We do not need the instructions of the ignorant slave owners of South Carolina, and we are not afraid of the grocer peddlers across the Atlantic, even if they are not here to sell respectable garters but disreputable bombs.
　　We are voting for peace, and in doing so, we are protecting all people, including the American people, from further devastating massacres. Our ranks are numerous and increasing daily. While those gentlemen in the White House and the lunatic asylum are performing black magic and brandishing bombs, they have lost 500 million people. If they continue with that black magic and cultivate plague germs, they will lose more than 500 million people.
　　Ehrenburg continued: They talked a lot about "world government." But even among themselves, they cannot reach an agreement. France and Italy cannot reconcile, nor can Britain and France, and even Tennessee and Illinois cannot agree. Savage hatred for other nations drives them; some burn black people, some abuse Jews, some insult Puerto Ricans, and some persecute Poles and Italians. We despise their hatred, their segregation, and their pride. We vote for the friendship of all Soviet citizens, for the great motherland of our people, praised in many languages.
　　Ehrenburg concluded: We have many candidates, and we know who we are voting for; we know each of them very well. But wherever we vote, we are voting for that great, most outstanding person who steered our ship through the storm and brought us to the happy, evergreen shore—Stalin.

　　我们投票
    ·爱伦堡·
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十二日刊载名作家爱伦堡的题为“我们投票”的论文称：在三月十二日，苏联人民为他们的祖国的荣誉、独立和自由而投票。我国人民永不会遵照外国的命令来生活。杜鲁门先生想要恫吓我们是徒然的，麦克马洪先生想要贿赂我们也是徒然的。我国人民的精力曾受到钢铁的考验，这种考验不是在会议上、不是在运动竞赛中，也不是在检阅中受到，而是在尔热夫、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、德聂伯河和奥得河的诸战役中受到的。我们不需要南加罗林纳州的愚昧无知的奴隶主的指示，我们并不害怕大西洋彼岸的杂货小贩，即使他们不是来推销可尊敬的吊袜带而是推销不受尊敬的炸弹的话。
    我们投票拥护和平，我们这样作就是保卫所有的人民，包括美国人民在内，使他们不再遭到毁灭性的大屠杀。我们的队伍是众多的，而且逐日在增加中。当那些白宫和疯人院的绅士们表演着黑色的魔术和挥舞着炸弹的时候，他们却失掉了五万万人。假若他们继续要那黑色的魔术和培育鼠疫菌的话，他们就要失去不止五万万人了。
    爱伦堡继称：他们谈了一大堆“世界政府”。但甚至在他们内部也不能达到协议。法国与意大利不能和好，英国与法国也是如此，甚至田纳西州和伊利诺斯州也都不能一致。对于别的民族的兽性仇恨驱策着他们，有的人烧死黑人，有的人虐待犹太人，另有一些人侮辱波多黎各人，还有一些人则迫害波兰人和意大利人。我们蔑视他们的仇恨、他们的隔离制度和他们的骄傲。我们为全体苏联公民的友爱而投票，为我国人民以许多种语言所歌颂的伟大祖国而投票。
    爱伦堡结语称：我们有许多的候选人，我们知道我们投谁的票，我们对他们当中的每一个人都很了解。但无论在那里投票，我们都在投票拥护那一个驾驶我们的船渡过暴风雨、把我们带到幸福的常绿的彼岸的伟大的、最优秀的人——斯大林。
