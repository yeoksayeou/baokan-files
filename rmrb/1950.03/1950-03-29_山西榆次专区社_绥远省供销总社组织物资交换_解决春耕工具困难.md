The Shanxi Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized the exchange of production materials lacking in both regions for spring plowing, in order to promote spring agricultural production. To solve the difficulty of lacking livestock during spring plowing, the Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative specifically organized the supply and marketing cooperatives of its subordinate counties to go to various producing areas in Suiyuan Province to purchase livestock. The Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to solve the difficulty of a lack of agricultural tools for its members, sent people to the Yangquan mining area to order ironware. To actively help the Suiyuan side complete its mission, the Yuci Special District Cooperative sent a special person to the Yangquan Supply and Marketing Cooperative on the 5th of this month to convene a meeting of county and village cooperatives. More than 40 people from Heshun, Xiyang, Pingding, Yuci, Yushe, Yangquan and other county and village cooperatives attended the meeting. In addition to conducting specific research on the livestock purchase plans of each county and the bank loan situation, the meeting also addressed the ideological concerns of cadres from various counties, such as fear of bandits, fear of high prices, and fear of wasting travel expenses without making a purchase. In particular, those who had experienced similar situations in the past had even greater concerns. After Director Li of the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Manager Du of the Cooperative Goods Station used facts to explain that the environment and social order in Suiyuan Province had undergone fundamental changes after liberation, and introduced the current situation in various parts of Suiyuan Province, these ideological concerns were resolved. Secondly, based on the types of livestock needed by each county and the producing areas of various livestock in Suiyuan Province (such as good horses, donkeys, and cattle produced in the Houtao area, and good mules produced in Jining, Fenzhen, etc.), the specific steps for the purchase were determined, and the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative was responsible for helping to handle the matter.

In addition, the Suiyuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative successively ordered 240,000 jin of wrought iron and 15,000 iron shovels from the Yangquan Supply and Marketing Cooperative, totaling 320,000 jin of millet. It was determined that the county cooperatives would withdraw the funds from the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative within ten days at the Yangquan listed price. Furthermore, a livestock purchasing team of 40 people from various county and village cooperatives was formed to go to Suiyuan, including 15 experienced old farmers and livestock brokers. They were divided into five groups and set off from Yangquan on March 7th. The grain and funds they carried could buy about 400 head of various livestock, and it was estimated that the task could be completed in one month.

In this way, not only were products exchanged between the two places, satisfying the actual needs of both, but also more than 7 million yuan in remittance fees were saved (calculated at 10 per mille), and the relationship between the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Yuci Special District Cooperative was strengthened, laying a good foundation for future material exchange between the two places.

　　山西榆次专区社  绥远省供销总社组织物资交换
    解决春耕工具困难
    【本报讯】山西榆次专区供销社与绥远省供销总社互相交换两地春耕中所缺乏的生产资料，以推动春耕生产。榆次专区供销社为解决春耕中牲口缺乏困难，特组织所属各县供销社，赴绥远省各产地购买牲口。绥远省供销总社则为解决社员农具缺乏困难，派人赴阳泉工矿区订购铁货。榆次专社为积极帮助其完成任务，于本月五日派专人到阳泉供销社召开了各县社及村社会议。参加会议者有和顺、昔阳、平定、榆次、榆社、阳泉等县、村社共四十余人。会议除按照各县购买牲口计划，与银行贷款情况作了具体研究外，并解决了各县干部怕土匪、怕价大、怕买不住白吃盘费等思想顾虑；特别是有些过去发生过类似情形者顾虑更多，经绥省总社李科长、合作货栈杜经理等用事实说明了解放后的绥省，环境和社会秩序已有了根本变化，并介绍了绥省目下各地情况后才解决了这些思想顾虑。其次根据各县所需牲口种类及绥省各种牲口之产区（如后套一带产好马，驴，牛，吉宁、汾镇等地产好骡子。）具体确定了进行购买步骤，并由绥省供销总社负责帮助办理。
    此外绥远供销总社向阳泉供销社先后订购熟铁二十四万斤、铁锹一万五千张，共合小米三十二万斤，确定十日内按阳泉牌价折款由各县社到绥省供销总社提款。并由各县社、村社共四十人组成了赴绥购牲口队，其中有有经验的老农和牲口牙纪十五人同往，编为五个小组，于三月七日由阳泉动身出发。所带粮款计可买各种牲口四百头左右，预计一个月可完成任务。
    这样，既交流了两地产品，满足了两地实际需要，节省了双方汇费七百余万元（按千分之十计算），并密切了绥远省总社和榆次专社之间关系，打下了今后两地物资交流的良好基础。
