　　Bourgeois Sham Democracy: Indian Version; New Indian Constitution Violates People's Interests
    "New Era" Publishes Article Criticizing Colonial Nature of Indian Constitution
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th] TASS, Moscow, 18th: "New Era" magazine published a paper by Yershov, stating that the recently passed Indian constitution is against the interests of the people. The paper points out that this constitution is based on the same foundation as all other bourgeois constitutions, namely the preservation of the mainstays of capitalism—the private ownership of land, forests, factories, workshops, and other means and instruments of production; the exploitation of man by man and the existence of exploiters and the exploited; the instability of the lives of the working masses and the extravagance of the few who live without working, etc. The author believes that the permanent private ownership of the means of production, in the current situation, is tantamount to attempting to perpetuate the colonial system of the Indian economy. The Indian constitution does nothing to prevent foreign monopoly capitalists, Indian big bourgeoisie, and feudal landlords from exploiting the working people. However, it restricts the right of the working people to fight against this exploitation. Article 23 of the Constitution authorizes government authorities to "enforce compulsory service for public purposes," which is to use scabs to break strikes.
    Article 19 of the Constitution does mention the freedoms of speech, assembly, and association, but it stipulates that the exercise of these freedoms "shall not affect the exercise of any existing laws," thus canceling all these freedoms.
    India has formally declared itself a federal state united by twenty-eight states. But this union is by no means a voluntary union. The states do not have the right to freely withdraw from the federation. All major administrative issues are to be decided by the central government, and the central government also has the power to take over the administration of any state if it is in a "serious emergency." Ten states have no elected bodies and are administered by representatives of the central government. Nine are ruled by princes in native states (or alliances of native states), who retain their imperial rights.
    The constitution does not recognize the equality of languages, but imposes Hindi on the whole country, although 220 million people in the country do not understand this language. The constitution declares that English—the language of Indian oppressors—will remain the official language of the country (other than Hindi) for the next fifteen years, although less than one percent of the total population speaks English.
    Yershov went on to discuss the undemocratic procedures for organizing legislative bodies. Only the House of Representatives and the legislative assemblies of the states are elected by the people. Half of the second chamber—the Senate—is appointed by the President, and half is elected by two-tiered elections. The inequality between the two houses of parliament, between the legislative assembly and the legislative assemblies of the states, and the undemocratic methods of composition of the Senates at all levels make them centers of reaction and obstruction of progress. The President also has a decisive vote on legislative affairs. He can veto any bill passed by both houses and send it back for reconsideration. The President has the power to declare emergency measures, thus suspending the exercise of the constitution and abolishing existing civil liberties.
    The author describes this constitution as an Indian version of bourgeois sham democracy. He asks the reader to note another feature that clearly demonstrates the true nature of the Indian constitution. India has been declared an "autonomous democratic republic," but, as already pointed out, the monarchy is still preserved in more than one-third of the republic's territory—within the native states. Yershov pointed out that there is nothing historically similar to this republic with several monarchies existing within it.
    In conclusion, the paper asks the reader to pay attention to India's subordination to Britain, as it is a member of the "British Commonwealth," which obliges the Indian government to always "consult" with London on foreign policy issues and participate in imperialist conferences, and must undertake many obligations that violate the interests of all ethnic groups in India. Yershov also cited the prominent fact that British people and British agents are densely populated in the Indian government agencies and the Indian army headquarters.

### 资产阶级假民主的印度版印新宪违反人民利益  《新时代》著文评印宪中殖民制度性质

　　资产阶级假民主的印度版印新宪违反人民利益
    《新时代》著文评印宪中殖民制度性质
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：新时代杂志刊载叶尔绍夫论文，表明最近通过的印度宪法是反对人民利益的。论文指出，这一宪法是根据其他所有资产阶级的宪法所根据的同一基础，即保存资本主义的主要倚靠——土地、森林、工厂、作坊以及其他生产手段与工具的私人占有制；人对人的剥削与剥削者和被剥削者的存在；劳苦大众的生活不稳定，不事劳动而生活安定的少数人的穷奢极侈等等。作者认为，生产手段的永久私人占有，在目前状况下，是等于企图使印度经济的殖民制度永久保持下去。印度宪法一点也没有妨碍外国垄断资本家，印度大资产阶级和封建地主剥削劳动人民。然而它却限制劳动人民与这种剥削进行斗争的权利。宪法第二十三条授权政府当局“实行为公众目的的强迫服务”，那便是利用工贼来破坏罢工。
    宪法第十九条确是说到了言论、集会及结社的自由，然而该条却规定对于这些自由的运用，“应不影响任何现存法律的行使”，因而取消了所有这些自由。
    印度已正式宣布为二十八个邦联合的联邦国家。但是这种联合绝不是自愿的联合。各邦并没有自由退出联邦的权利。行政上的一切重大问题都要由中央政府决定，而如果处在“严重的紧急状态”，中央政府也有权接管任何一邦的行政。十个邦没有任何民选的机构，而由中央政府的代表来管理。九个是土邦（或土邦联盟）中的王公统治者们，都保留了他们的帝王权利。
    宪法不承认语言的平等，而把印度语强加诸予全国，虽然全国有二亿二千万人不懂这种语言。宪法宣布英语——印度压迫者的语言——在今后十五年内，仍为该国（印度语以外）的正式语言，虽然会说英语的人不到全人口的百分之一。
    叶尔绍夫继之论及组织立法机关的不民主程序。只有众议院和各邦的立法议会是民选的。第二院——参议院一半是由总统指定的，一半是由两级选举选出的。议会两院间、立法议会与各邦的立法议会间的不平等，以及各级参院组成的不民主方法，使它们成为反动与阻碍进步的中心。总统对立法事务还享有决定权。他可以否决甚至两院都通过的任何法案并将其驳回重行考虑。总统有权宣布紧急措施，因而停止宪法的行使和废除现有的公民的自由。
    作者描写这部宪法为资产阶级假民主的印度版。他要求读者注意清楚表明印度宪法真正性质的另一特点。印度已被宣布为“自主的民主共和国”，但是，正如业已指出的，君主政体仍保留在三分之一以上的共和国领土——各土邦之内。叶尔绍夫指出，历史上还没有与这种存在着几个君主国的共和国相同的东西。
    在结语中，论文要求读者注意印度对英国的附属性质，因为它是“不列颠联邦”的一员，这就使印度政府在外交政策问题上永远有与伦敦“磋商”和参加帝国主义会议的义务，并且必须承担许多违背印度各族人民利益的义务。叶尔绍夫还引证了特出的事实：印度的政府机关与印度军队统帅部中，密布着英国人和英国的代理人。
