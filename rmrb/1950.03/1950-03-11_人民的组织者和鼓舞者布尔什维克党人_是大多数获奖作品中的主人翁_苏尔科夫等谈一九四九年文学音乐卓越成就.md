Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th (TASS dispatch from March 8th): Surkov, Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, recently spoke about the Stalin Prizes in Literature and Art, stating that the novels awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949 are all works loved by Soviet readers. The Bolsheviks, the organizers and ideological inspirers of the masses, are the protagonists in most of the award-winning works. Babayevsky's "Light Over the Land" is a novel about collective farmers. Lovova's "Meadow in the Forest" is one of the first literary works describing Stalin's plan for transforming nature. Kazakevich's novel "Spring on the Oder" reveals the qualities of Soviet soldiers in the Great Patriotic War with great skill. In Vishnevsky's play "The Unforgettable Year 1919," the author recreates an outstanding stage in the heroic struggle to defend the fruits of the October Revolution, and Stalin embodies the immense organizational and inspiring power of the Bolshevik Party, which is inseparable from the people. Mikhalkov's play "I Want to Go Home" addresses a sharp international political theme, depicting the crimes of imperialist representatives as the Soviet people strive to bring back Soviet children abducted by the Hitlerite bandits. Many award-winning poems are about the struggle against warmongers and exposing the bestiality of modern imperialism, such as the collection of poems "Two Lands" by the Azerbaijani poet Rustam. Winners in children's literature include Vasilenko's novel "Little Star," which depicts the life and work of elementary school students, and Musatov's novel about collective farms, "Stochali."

Hrennikov, Secretary-General of the Soviet Composers' Union, stated that a decisive shift occurred in the development of Soviet music in 1949. The sense of reality in the life of socialist society, and the portrayal of the life of socialist society with popular and simple images, are characteristics of most musical works. The winners include composers of various styles and nationalities. Shostakovich, who won the award for "Song of the Forests," had been criticized two years earlier for serious errors of formalism, and these works are his response to those stern criticisms. "Song of the Forests," with the Stalin plan for transforming nature as its theme, is known for its optimism and its bright sense of the world. The winners include a group of young composers, including Ukrainian composer Zhukovsky's vocal work "Glory to My Motherland," Azerbaijani young composer Yangirov's "Beyond the Aras River," Moldavian composer Nyaga's "Triumphal Song" and "Stalin's Song," and Latvian Ivanov's Sixth Symphony. Pianist Richter, Red Army Choir Director Alexandrov, and dancers Virsky, orchestra conductor Vinogradov, singers Babayev, Mamidov, and Koskov also won awards.

　　人民的组织者和鼓舞者布尔什维克党人
    是大多数获奖作品中的主人翁
    苏尔科夫等谈一九四九年文学音乐卓越成就
    【新华社北京十日电】综合塔斯社八日讯：苏联作家协会副总书记苏尔科夫顷谈斯大林文学艺术奖金称：一九四九年创作中荣获斯大林奖金的小说，都是苏联读者所喜爱的作品。人民大众的组织者和思想鼓舞者布尔什维克党人，是大多数获奖作品中的主人翁。巴巴也夫斯基的《大地之光》是写集体农民的小说。洛芙娃的《森林里的草地》是描述斯大林改造自然计划的第一批文学作品之一。卡萨基维奇的小说《奥德河之春》，以伟大的技巧显露了爱国战争中苏军战士的品质。在维施涅夫斯基的剧本《难忘的一九一九年》中，作者把保卫十月革命果实的英勇斗争史中的一个杰出阶段重现出来，并从斯大林身上表现了与人民有不可分的布尔什维克党的巨大组织力量与鼓舞力量。米哈尔科夫的剧本《我要回家》，以尖锐的国际政治为主题，描写苏联人民争取被希特勒匪徒所拐走的苏联儿童归国时帝国主义代表们的罪行。许多获奖的诗篇是关于反对战争贩子的斗争及揭露现代帝国主义的兽性的，如象阿塞拜疆诗人鲁斯塔姆的诗集《两个国度》。儿童文学得奖者有华西伦科的描写小学生生活与工作的小说《小星星》，慕萨托夫关于集体农庄的小说《斯托查利》。
    苏联作曲家协会秘书长赫连尼科夫谈称：苏联音乐的发展，在一九四九年发生了决定性的转变。社会主义社会生活的现实感，以及用大众化的简单形象来描绘社会主义社会的生活，是大部分乐曲的特性。获奖者包括各种不同风格和不同民族的作曲家。因《森林之歌》而获奖的萧斯塔科维奇，在两年前曾被批评犯有形式主义的严重错误，而这些作品就是他对那些严正批评的回答。《森林之歌》以斯大林改造自然计划为题材，以其乐观、对世界的光明感见称。获奖者包括一批青年作曲家，内有乌克兰作曲家儒科夫斯基的声乐《光荣归于我的祖国》，阿塞拜疆青年作曲家扬吉罗夫的《阿拉斯河的彼岸》，摩尔达维亚作曲家尼亚加的《凯歌》和《斯大林之歌》，以及拉脱维亚的伊凡诺夫的第六交响乐。钢琴家里契特尔，红军歌舞团团长亚历山德罗夫，及舞蹈家维尔斯基、乐队指挥维诺格拉多夫、歌手巴巴耶夫、马米多夫和科丝科夫等人亦均获奖。
