　　Lenin and Stalin established a complete doctrine of socialist revolution and colonial national revolution. One of the cornerstones is the leading role of the proletariat in these two major revolutions. "Only the proletariat can become -- Lenin wrote -- a fighter for a thorough struggle for democracy, and only under such conditions can the proletariat become a victorious fighter for the struggle for democracy, that is, the peasant masses are united in its revolutionary struggle." (Note 1)
    The great October Socialist Revolution was victorious because it was led by the revolutionary working class of Russia and its politically experienced vanguard -- the Bolshevik Party; it was victorious because the Russian working class had an important ally in the revolution in the form of the poor peasants, who constituted the vast majority of the Russian peasant population. The experience of the Russian revolutionary struggle is of great significance for the national liberation struggles of the peoples of various colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries.
    The achievements of the post-war national liberation movement, especially the historical victory of the Chinese people in destroying the Kuomintang reactionary group and creating the People's Republic of China, is a very vivid portrayal of the victory of Lenin and Stalin's doctrine of colonial national revolution, the doctrine of the leading role of the proletariat in this revolution.
    The Stable Era of Oppressing Colonies Has Passed Since the October Revolution
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that after the Great October Revolution, the stable era of exploiting and oppressing colonies and dependent countries had passed, and the era of revolutionary liberation of colonies and dependent countries had arrived, the era of awakening of the proletariat in these countries, the era of the proletariat leading this revolution. "...The October Revolution opened a new era, that is, the era of the alliance of the people of all oppressed countries in the world with the proletariat and the colonial revolution under the leadership of the proletariat." (Note 2)
    The Great October Socialist Revolution broke the chains of colonial national oppression in Tsarist Russia and equally liberated all the oppressed nationalities of our country. "Precisely because the colonial national revolution in our country was led by the proletariat and carried out under the banner of internationalism, the nationalities that were once despised and enslaved have, for the first time in human history, risen to the position of truly free and truly equal nationalities, and set an example to inspire all oppressed nationalities in the world." (Note 3) The oppressed nationalities of various colonial and semi-colonial countries have obtained the support and reliable friend of the Soviet Union in their anti-imperialist struggle.
    After the Great October Socialist Revolution, the national liberation movements of the oppressed nationalities gradually strengthened, constantly shaking the rear of imperialism. Comrade Stalin made a classic determination of the general crisis of capitalism, pointing out that one of the basic signs of its characteristics is: "The imperialist war and the victory of the Soviet revolution disrupted the imperialist system in the colonies and dependent countries, the authority of imperialism in these countries has been damaged, and it no longer has the power to dominate these countries as before." (Note 4)
    The struggle of the nationalities of Southeast Asia, the Near East, and Africa for freedom and independence against imperialist oppression shows different forms and scales in different countries. This difference is determined by: the comparison of class forces within these countries, the degree of their industrial development, the level of consciousness and organization of the proletariat, the struggle of the proletariat for leadership in the national liberation movement and for allies, primarily the achievements of the struggle to win over the peasants who make up the majority of the population in the colonies and semi-colonies.
    Between the two world wars, China occupied a major position in the revolutionary movement of oppressed nations.
    The Chinese Revolution is Characterized by the Struggle Between Two Lines
    Comrade Stalin paid great attention to the revolutionary issue in China. He instructed that the characteristics of the Chinese revolution are the struggle between two lines: the path of the national bourgeoisie, which attempts to defeat the proletariat, compromise with imperialism, and jointly oppose the revolution, in order to end the revolution by establishing capitalist rule; the other path is the path of the proletariat, which seeks to cast aside the national bourgeoisie and consolidate its leadership, leading hundreds of millions of working masses in cities and rural areas to overcome the resistance of the national bourgeoisie, in order to achieve the complete victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and gradually guide this revolution onto the track of socialist revolution.
    Completing these tasks of striving for and consolidating the leadership of the proletariat, carrying out the democratic revolution, and creating conditions for socialist construction requires a long and arduous struggle.
    In this struggle, the Chinese Communist Party relied on the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and relied on the great historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). On the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the birth of the CCP on July 1, 1949, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, wrote in an essay entitled "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "We want to fight against enemies at home and abroad, inside and outside the Party. Thank you Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, they gave us weapons. This weapon is not a machine gun, but Marxism-Leninism. ...The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese did not know Lenin and Stalin, let alone Marx and Engels. The sound of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the whole world and also helped China, using the proletarian world view as a tool to observe the destiny of the country, re-examine their own problems, and take the path of the Russians -- that is the conclusion." (Note 5)
    The basic pillar of foreign imperialism in China was the feudal warlords. Foreign imperialists used these or those warlords to expand their spheres of influence in China. Feudal remnants ruled China, intensifying military oppression and bureaucratic autocracy. In order to please foreign capital, the reactionary government stifled national industry. The Chinese industrial bourgeoisie, which had considerably increased its capital and expanded production during the First World War, was in a position of opposition to foreign imperialists. At that time, imperialists preferred to use comprador commercial capital for their own enterprises. Under these conditions, the national bourgeoisie stood in the ranks of the united front against imperialist and feudal warlord groups for its own interests.
    The anti-feudal bureaucratic oppression, anti-warlord, and anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of workers and peasants in China began precisely after the Russian October Revolution and the end of the First World War. In 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was formed, and the following year it led the workers' strike struggles. This struggle had great political significance. If the Chinese Communist Party did not establish powerful organizations of the broad proletariat in the first step of its activities, if these organizations -- first of all, trade unions -- were not under the leadership of the Communist Party, if the Communist Party failed to gain the position of leader in the worker movement and lead it forward along the revolutionary road, along the road of its alliance with socialism, then the proletariat's leadership in the Chinese revolution would be impossible. In June 1923, the Third National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party decided that the Party should join the Kuomintang. At this time, the Communist Party had substantial experience in the revolutionary leadership of the worker movement. Thereafter, in 1924, the Kuomintang National Congress passed Sun Yat-sen's proposal to include farmers and workers as Kuomintang members. In this way, a foundation was created in China for establishing a united front against foreign imperialism and reactionary warlords.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that the conclusion of a united front with the national bourgeoisie in the first stage of the colonial revolution does not mean that the Communists should not sharpen the struggle of workers and peasants against landlords and the national bourgeoisie, and that the proletariat should abandon its independence, even to the slightest extent, even for a minute. "Only under that circumstance, only under that condition can the united front have revolutionary significance, that is, if it does not hinder the Communist Party from carrying out its own political and organizational independent work, organizing the proletariat as an independent political force, arousing the peasant class against landlords, and openly organizing workers and peasants' revolution, thus preparing the conditions for the proletariat's leadership." (Note 6)
    The Chinese proletariat consolidated its ranks and tempered itself in the struggle of alliance strikes against foreign capital, and at the same time struggled to expand its influence among the broad masses of laborers. The proletariat's party, its progressive and organized ranks, grew and consolidated. If in 1925 the Chinese Communist Party had 2,000 members, then in 1927 the Chinese Communist Party had increased to 60,000 members. In these years, the Chinese Communist Party led extremely large-scale alliance strike battles; the Party has achieved a special increase in the number of trade unions. If the representatives attending the first Chinese Trade Union Congress initiated by the CCP in 1925 represented 2.3 million organized workers in China, then in 1927 the workers participating in trade union organizations had reached 3 million. The revolutionary movement attracted hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants. Finally, the Communist Party was able to absorb entire regiments and divisions of the people's army into its ranks, "...the Chinese Communist Party was able to turn this ideal of the proletariat's leadership from a wish into a fact during this period..." (Note 7) -- Stalin wrote.
    The success of the Communist Party in striving for the proletariat's leadership in the national liberation movement, which differs from other countries, is due to the weakness and disorganization of the Chinese bourgeoisie. The large national bourgeoisie feared the scale of the revolutionary movement of laborers and turned to the counter-revolutionary camp. The bourgeoisie relied on the assistance of foreign imperialists in an attempt to stop the revolution at the "first step" in order to immediately strangle it. However, the Chinese bourgeoisie, who seized state power by relying on foreign imperialists, failed to stop the Chinese revolution.
    The Chinese Proletariat Leads the Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Feudal Revolution
    "If the characteristics of the first stage are that the spearhead of the revolution is mainly directed against anti-imperialism, then the characteristics of the second stage are the fact that the revolution mainly directs its spearhead against internal enemies, first of all against feudal lords and the anti-feudal system." (Note 8)
    Undermining the comprador national bourgeoisie, the agents of British and American imperialism, and conducting a brutal struggle against them was an extremely important task of the Chinese working class in the second stage of the revolution. The Chinese revolution entered a higher form of its development, the form of land revolution. The land revolution took on extremely broad dimensions and greatly frightened the petty bourgeoisie intellectuals represented by the Wuhan government of the Kuomintang, who also turned to the counter-revolutionary camp. This marked a temporary failure of the revolution. "But therefore -- Comrade Stalin instructed -- it unites the broad masses of peasants and urban poor more closely around the proletariat, and thereby creates a foundation for the proletariat's leadership." (Note 9)
    Based on the peasant guerrilla warfare movement under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, tens of millions of Red Army soldiers were established, and the initial bases of democratic power emerged in China. At the First All-China Soviet Congress representing 60 million people, the new democratic regime of China -- the Soviet regime -- was established in November 1931. The new institutions of revolutionary power were institutions of uprising against the existing regime of the Kuomintang, institutions of struggle for a new, democratic regime. At the same time, they were also institutions for carrying out the bourgeois democratic revolution and the land revolution in China, a revolution that was far from complete. In its struggle against the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang, the new, democratic regime became a powerful revolutionary center of gravity for all progressive elements in the country. After Japan invaded China, the Chinese Red Army reorganized itself into the People's Liberation Army in order to establish and consolidate the national united front, and became the main force in the struggle against the Japanese occupiers.
    During the Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, the democratic regimes established in the areas liberated from the Japanese occupiers by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and guerrilla forces were the regimes of the entire people. It gained the trust and support of not only the people of the democratic regions, but also the entire Chinese people. Industrial enterprises in the liberated areas were turned into the property of the entire people; peasants acquired land; the power of capitalists, landlords, and foreign imperialists was liquidated; the alliance of laboring classes among the people, led by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, became the basic leading force. For the first time, the Chinese people believed through their own experience that the people's democratic regime truly represented themselves.
    The Leading Strength of the Chinese Working Class Has Passed the Test of History
    By the end of World War II, the scope of leadership of the Chinese Communist Party had expanded to eighteen liberated areas with a population of 140 million. The Communist Party has won the great prestige and respect of the majority of the people in the country. The leadership of the Chinese working class and its leadership over the peasants have not only been won, but also passed the test of history.
    In the process of the land revolution launched by the Chinese Communist Party in the vast Chinese territory, the leading role of the proletariat in the national liberation struggle was enhanced, and its influence among the peasant masses increased. At this stage of the Chinese revolution, the Communist Party attracted not only the proletariat and peasants, but also the democratic strata of the national bourgeoisie to the struggle for the democratization of the country.
    Between the two world wars, China occupied the vanguard position in the revolutionary movement of the people of all colonies and semi-colonies. But at that time, the imperialist chains also formed many other weak links, in which serious threats were posed to the rule of the imperialists. During this period, the national liberation movement of the Indian people reached its peak.
    The Indian proletariat accounted for a larger number of the colonial countries. If the total number of industrial workers in China in 1927, according to Chinese survey data, did not exceed 1.5 million, then in the same year the Indian urban proletariat had exceeded 3.5 million. Just as in China, it was not only industrial workers who participated in the national liberation struggle in India. Hundreds of millions of peasants, millions of handicraftsmen in small factories and workshops, dockworkers, coolies, rickshaw pullers, and other urban poor became active participants in the mass revolutionary struggle, and of course, the better organized and disciplined industrial workers were the snipers of this struggle.
    The Indian proletariat has actively participated in alliance strike struggles since the end of the 19th century, that is, much earlier than China, and these struggles often turned into political struggles. In 1905, Indian textile workers held a strike to oppose the capitalists' attempt to extend working hours. In 1906, Bengal railway workers launched a political general strike; in May 1907, Punjab railway workers refused to transport troops sent by British imperialism to suppress peasant riots. In 1908, Lenin wrote about the political general strike of Indian textile workers: "Even in India, the proletariat has grown to conscious political mass struggle." (Note 10)
    The Indian Proletariat Has Become an Independent Political Force
    The Indian worker movement achieved a broad scale from 1918 to 1922. Along with the unprecedentedly powerful strikes in India, there were mass demonstrations and labor conferences. After workers' demonstrations in the city of Amritsar (in northern India, near Kashmir, now belonging to Pakistan -- translator) were subjected to bloody shootings in 1919, the national liberation movement spread throughout the country. During the revolutionary climax of 1930-1932, and on the eve of the Second World War, the proletariat of India began to become an independent political force. The scope of the Indian peasant movement also expanded. From 1919 to 1922, and from 1930 to 1932, peasant movements held armed uprisings in a series of places, destroying landlord property and confiscating landlord grain. The Indian people gave a serious blow to the rear of the capitalist system, and their struggle helped the international proletariat to disrupt the imperialist camp.
    However, the Indian revolutionary movement was far behind the Chinese revolutionary movement in terms of its scale and achievements. The Indian working class did not achieve the same achievements as the Chinese working class in the struggle for its own leadership in the revolutionary movement. In the struggle for its own leadership in the revolutionary movement, the Indian working class encountered a very strong opponent in the form of British imperialism, which used every means within its command to oppress and split the national liberation movement.
    British imperialism adopted cruel and bloody terror and all means of suppression to oppose the national liberation movements of the nationalities of colonies and semi-colonies, and at the same time widely used bourgeois national reformism. National reformism -- whose representatives in colonies and semi-colonies are the national bourgeoisie -- like all reformism, rejects the revolutionary road of liberating the country from imperialist oppression. National reformists deceive laborers, asserting that it seems to be possible to reach freedom and independence by gradually realizing reforms.
    The Valuable Experience of the Chinese Revolution
    After years of struggle, the Chinese Communist Party achieved the smashing of national reformism and the isolation of its representatives -- the national bourgeoisie and the urban petty bourgeoisie -- from the broad masses of the working class and peasants. "....The national bourgeoisie -- Mao Zedong wrote in the above-mentioned paper -- cannot serve as the leader of the revolution, nor should it occupy the main position in the state power. The reason why the national bourgeoisie cannot serve as the leader of the revolution and should not occupy the main position in the state power is because the socio-economic position of the national bourgeoisie stipulates their weakness, their lack of foresight, their lack of sufficient courage, and that many people are afraid of the masses. Sun Yat-sen advocated "arousing the masses" or "supporting the workers and peasants." Who will "arouse" and "support" them? Sun Yat-sen meant the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. But this is impossible in fact. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of revolution failed. What is the reason for this? In the age of imperialism, the bourgeoisie cannot lead any real revolution to victory. That is the reason. Our twenty-eight years are very different. We have many valuable experiences. A party with discipline armed with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin that adopts the method of self-criticism and links with the masses of the people. An army led by such a party. A united front of various revolutionary classes and factions led by such a party. These three are the main experiences. These are all what distinguish us from our predecessors. Relying on these three, we have achieved basic victory. We have gone through a tortuous road. We have struggled against opportunist tendencies within the Party, both right and left." (Note 11)
    Remnants of Indian Social Reformism Still Play a Role
    National reformism has never had such a powerful influence in China as in India. The power of the Chinese big bourgeoisie had been strengthened during the Northern Expedition and the period of KMT-CPC cooperation. But when it betrayed the national revolution and openly turned into the reactionary agents of British and American imperialism, this power immediately disappeared. At the same time, a considerable number of Chinese petty bourgeoisie and middle class who were oppressed by imperialism and huge bureaucratic capital gradually became closely connected with the revolutionary united front led by the CCP.
    National reformism in India began to consolidate and expand its power since the establishment of the National Congress in 1885. The alliance of free elements among the Indian bourgeoisie and landlords attempted to consolidate their economic positions within the scope of the colonial oppression system through gradual reforms, and to convince the masses of the "inappropriateness" of revolutionary struggle. The Indian national bourgeoisie spread the delusion of reaching independence through the road of reform and the possibility of "decolonization by the hands of imperialists," and preserved its influence among the laboring masses in India.
    As early as 1925, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the bourgeoisie of India had been divided into revolutionary and compromise factions, and the compromise elements of the bourgeoisie had been able to basically reach a compromise with imperialism. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the compromise elements in the Indian bourgeoisie allied with imperialism to oppose the workers and peasants of their own country. "A revolutionary victory cannot be achieved without breaking this alliance. But in order to break this alliance, it is necessary to focus fire on the compromising national bourgeoisie, expose its rebellious behavior, liberate the laboring masses from its influence, and systematically prepare the conditions necessary for the proletariat's leadership. In other words, in a colony like India, it is necessary to prepare for the proletariat to advance to the leadership position in the liberation movement, and step by step remove the bourgeoisie and its spokespersons from this sacred position. The task is to form a revolutionary anti-imperialist alliance and guarantee the proletariat's leadership in this alliance." (Note 12)
    Comrade Stalin taught that the independence of the Communist Party "should be the basic slogan of the advanced elements of communism, because only the Communist Party can prepare and realize the proletariat's leadership." (Note 13) At that time, the Communist Party had not yet been formed in India. The Worker-Peasant Party formed in 1925 was the first organization to unite the various communist groups in India at that time, but this organization included representatives of petty bourgeoisie intellectuals, including left-wing social reformists. Social reformists, agents of the national bourgeoisie, infiltrated the working class, talking about democracy and socialism, attempting to make the working class accept the influence of the national bourgeoisie. The influence of social reformism was manifested in the activities of Indian communist organizations, the organization of trade unions, and their leadership policies. Factional struggles occurred within individual groups that joined the Worker-Peasant Party organization. The expulsion of the traitor Roy, who instigated factional struggle within the party, in 1928 improved the situation. However, the remnants of social reformism continued to play a role after that. After the Indian trade union organization was founded from 1912 to 1920, bourgeois elements and social reformists among them immediately took the leading position, and they implemented a compromise policy. The Indian trade union movement split in 1929. In 1931, three leading centers of trade unions were formed domestically: the All-India Trade Union Federation led by right-wing reformists, the All-India Trade Union Congress under "left" leadership, and the Red Trade Union Congress, which unified the revolutionary organizations of the Indian proletariat. The split of the Indian worker movement clearly showed the further development of the Indian laborers' anti-imperialist struggle, which was characterized by organizational unsoundness.
    At the end of 1933, a unified Communist Party was established in India by uniting the various communist groups that had been established previously. Since then, the Indian working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, began to enter the political arena as an independent force, and for the first time, in essence, carried out an anti-bourgeois struggle for leadership in the national liberation movement. In 1935, the Red Trade Union Congress and the All-India Trade Union Congress merged to form the Indian United Trade Union Congress, and the strength and scale of the domestic trade union movement greatly increased. The growth of the Communist Party's power among the masses alarmed the British imperialists and their lackeys in the Indian bourgeoisie. In 1934, the Indian Communist Party was declared illegal.
    On the eve of World War II, the Indian revolutionary struggle surged again. The strike movement included broad masses of workers, and capitalists were often forced to concede. Workers in the Bengal jute industry, Kanpur textile workers, railway workers, etc. held strikes. In the struggle, the working class tempered itself into the most organized and powerful force in India's anti-imperialist forces. The ideal of the Communists to establish an anti-imperialist united front in India aroused resonance and support among the vast majority of oppressed laborers. In 1936, a new peasant alliance was born, basically under the leadership of the Communists.
    The CPI's Anti-Imperialist United Front Gained Resonance from the Working People
    In 1942, after eight years of long-term underground survival, the Communist Party became legal. The openness of the Communist Party and the consolidation of its ties with the masses contributed to the growth of the Party and the consolidation of the organization. The number of party members increased from 4,000 in 1942 to 16,000 in 1943. The First National Congress of the Indian Communist Party was held in 1943, and the Congress confirmed that the Party's influence had become extremely strong, not only among workers, but also among peasants and intellectuals.
    However, the old leadership of the Communist Party had not yet been liberated from the influence of reformism, which was manifested in the Party's policies during World War II. The "Mountbatten Plan" regarding the division of India and the recognition of the dominions of India and Pakistan was nothing but an agreement between British imperialism and the upper strata of the Indian bourgeoisie, a new form of economic and political dependence of these dominions on British imperialism. Initially, the leadership of the Indian Communist Party assessed it as a way of "moving forward," without seeing it as a new form of British imperialism attacking the Indian people. After India was divided into two dominions, the party leadership decided to support Nehru's bourgeois government and the "rationality" of forming a national united front "from Gandhi to the Communists." This reformist line was discussed at the Second Indian Communist Party Congress held from February to March 1948 and overturned with firm criticism.
    This is the development of the struggle for the working class to win the leading role in the national liberation movement in the two major countries of the East between the First and Second World Wars and at the end of the Second World War. Under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin's theory on colonial national liberation, the working class, headed by the Communist Party, became the main force in the struggle of hundreds of millions of people in China and India for national freedom and independence.
  Soviet International Prestige Increased After the Second World War
    After the Second World War, the rise of the Soviet Union and its international prestige grew incalculably. The great victory of the Soviet people in the Patriotic War confirmed to the world with new strength that socialism surpasses capitalism. The operations and victorious conclusions of the Soviet army expanded the cracks in the world system of imperialism; a series of countries in Central and Southeast Europe -- the People's Democratic countries on the road to building the foundations of socialism -- broke out of these cracks. The anti-imperialist revolutionary front of oppressed nations gained stronger support than before.
    The Soviet Union, which exposed the aggressive policies and sinful actions of the Anglo-American group to the world, and its assistance and support to the rapid development of the national liberation struggle of the colonies and dependent countries is of inestimable significance. The Soviet army, which expelled the Japanese invaders from Manchuria and North Korea, prevented the imperialists from interfering in these areas and prevented the counter-revolutionary forces from seizing power there. In this way, the Soviet people not only liberated the people of China and Korea from the shackles of the Japanese invaders, but also laid the conditions for the formation and consolidation of people's democracy in China and North Korea.
    "If there were no Soviet Union, -- Mao Zedong wrote -- if there were no victory of the anti-fascist Second World War, especially knocking down Japanese imperialism for us, if there were no emergence of various new democratic countries, if there were no oppressed nations of the East rising to struggle, if there were no struggle between the popular masses within the capitalist countries of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, etc. and the reactionary factions ruling them, if there were no comprehensive combination of all these, then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would certainly be many times more than now. Under such circumstances, could we win? Obviously not. If we win, it will be impossible to consolidate." (Note 14)
    Imperialist Camp Contradictions Are Extremely Sharpened
    The incomparable intensification of the imbalanced development of the imperialist countries and the inevitable new sharp contradictions, disputes, and controversies among them are of great significance for the national liberation movement in the colonies and semi-colonies after the Second World War. American imperialism, which made a fortune from the war and the blood of the people, attempted to change the world to adapt to the changes in the balance of imperialist forces after the Second World War. In the struggle to lay the foundation for its world rule, American monopoly capital often contradicted the interests of the imperialist plunderers who had been weakened after the war. The main contradiction in the imperialist camp -- the contradiction between British and American imperialism -- has become extremely sharpened.
    During the war, Britain's relations with its colonies weakened; during the war economy, it depended on the United States for supplies of food and industrial products. After the war, although British imperialism returned to its colonies, it encountered the expanded American forces there. American capital increasingly extensively penetrated the countries of the British Empire; in their trade, the United States now occupies almost the same position as Britain. The United States does not let Britain out of the shackles of financial and economic dependency, and gradually takes away the control of the colonies from its hands, driving it out of its previous "spheres of influence" and demoting it to its own servants. The colonial throne of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands is increasingly shaking, and the "Marshallization" of the major European imperialist suzerain states is increasingly turning them into the vassals of the United States. Nevertheless, the British, French, Dutch, and Belgian imperialists are still opposed to the proliferation of American capital in their colonies, and attempt to consolidate their inherent position in the colonies. All this caused the extreme instability and extreme vulnerability of the entire front of imperialism in the colonies. At the same time, the imperialists, under the protection of the American imperialists, are unanimous when it comes to suppressing the liberation movements of the oppressed nations.
    The Second World War gave the national industries of the colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries an opportunity for development. The expansion of industrial production in the colonial world during the war was conditional, on the one hand, cutting off the import of essential food and daily necessities from the suzerain state. On the other hand, the military raw materials and other needs that the suzerain state needed for combat were enhanced. This prompted the colonies to develop mining, raw material industries, and build military factory bases belonging to the imperialists in the raw material producing areas. At the same time, it also increased the number of workshop-style small industries, and gave rise to family industries and handicrafts. However, although certain industries in many colonies and dependent countries have developed, they are still in a colonial state as in the past. "This is the special method of imperialism -- that is, developing industry in the colonies in order to tie it to the suzerain state, to the ropes of imperialism." (Note 15)
    The development of industry in the colonies and semi-colonies has the characteristics of being deformed and biased. But at the same time, it also caused the growth of the national proletariat. The Indian proletariat has increased by almost one million. At the same time, a process of strong differentiation of the peasant class occurred in the colonies, expanding the agricultural proletariat.
    Imperialism Colludes with Comprador Bourgeoisie to Intensify Extraction of Wealth
    During the war, the colonies and semi-colonies of imperialism absorbed a large amount of wealth, and the residents of the colonies were trapped in hunger and death.
    The imperialist powers -- the suzerain states intensified the plunder and exploitation of the colonies, further sharpening the contradictions within these colonies and semi-colonies. The imperialists attempted to expand their social base in the colonial countries and strengthen their wooing of the large national bourgeoisie to their side as tools for them to extract wealth and more broadly enslave the colonial people. Under the help of the imperialists, the local big bourgeoisie ruling groups became the center of the anti-democratic struggle in the colonies and semi-colonies. These national bourgeoisie groups, in some countries, such as in India and China, with the support of the imperialists, became huge monopolistic, comprador alliances.
    China's "four big families" -- Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Lifu, Song Ziwen, and Kong Xiangxi -- are a vivid example of this kind of monopolistic alliance. In Kuomintang China, all political and economic power belonged to them. With the help of American imperialism, they concentrated huge amounts of capital and natural resources in their own hands. They not only adopted capitalist methods, but also pre-capitalist methods of exploitation. They have become extremely typical representatives of huge financial capital closely combined with state organs and foreign capital.
    Like China's, India's monopolistic alliance also gained huge profits during the war, enhancing its economic strength. Although the commanders of Birla, Tata, Dalmia, and other companies did not express opposition to the resolutions of the anti-British conference, in essence they were and still are the agents and allies of British capital in India. The Indian big bourgeoisie is beneficial to the rule of foreign imperialists in India. It is concerned about engaging in anti-people movement struggles with the help of British imperialism. For its own class interests, it betrayed the national liberation struggle. The Indian bourgeoisie helped the British imperialists establish a system in India after the war that, in the form of superficial "independence," still retained the colonial exploitation of the residents by British monopoly capital unchanged.
    The close combination of the large national bourgeoisie and foreign imperialism also occurred in other colonies and dependent countries. The compromising bourgeoisie group is the enemy and stifler of the national liberation movement of the oppressed nationalities. They and the imperialists organized domestic wars against the progressive democratic forces of their own countries.
    The Democratic Anti-Imperialist Front in the Colonies is Developing and Growing
    After the Second World War, the proletariat in many colonies and semi-colonies has been recognized as the leader of the national liberation movement. In the colonies and dependent countries, the liberation of laboring peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie from the influence of the big bourgeoisie will develop and is developing at a rapid pace. Now the Communist Parties in many semi-colonial and colonial countries -- Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and others -- unite the various strata of the broad masses of people under their leadership in the democratic anti-imperialist front.
    The victorious people of hundreds of millions of Chinese people -- the people -- are at the forefront of the revolutionary national liberation movement. The reactionary feudal bourgeois Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, supported by American imperialism, immediately plunged China into a bloody domestic war after the Second World War. The Kuomintang government rejected the democratization of China proposed by the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties, which represented the interests of patriotic groups of the proletariat, laboring peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and middle-class national bourgeoisie. This demand of the people attacked the working class and its leader -- the Communist Party, the protector of its interests -- the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In 1946, the Kuomintang army equipped by the United States outnumbered the People's Liberation Army three times. But in less than two years, Chiang Kai-shek's basic forces were crushed. By June 1949, the Kuomintang army had lost more than 5.5 million people. Nearly 60% of China's population has been liberated from the feudal, bourgeois, reactionary Kuomintang government. By October 1949, the vast majority of the people of China had been liberated, and on October 1, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed, and the Central People's Government headed by Communist leader Mao Zedong was elected. The years-long struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the working class completed a great historical victory. 475 million residents on the earth were liberated from the oppression of imperialism and began to move towards the road of socialism.
    The decisive factors for these victories of the Chinese people are the leadership role of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tempered in combat. The Chinese Communist Party, following the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, achieved the uniting of the Chinese people around the working class, around the revolutionary People's Liberation Army, and crushed the anti-people and anti-national betrayal policies of the Kuomintang reactionary group.
    The Foundation of the National United Front is the Worker-Peasant Alliance
    The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have won the respect, support, and admiration of the entire people. A national united front, unprecedented in history in terms of breadth and depth, was established in the country, uniting workers, peasants, the urban petty bourgeoisie, ethnic minorities, and certain strata in the middle class of industry and commerce. The Chinese petty bourgeoisie and middle class were oppressed and squeezed out by the reactionary big bourgeoisie landlord class and the Kuomintang regime in the hands of monopoly capital. The petty bourgeoisie and middle class had no or very little relationship with imperialism. This is why this bourgeoisie, defined by Mao Zedong as the "true national bourgeoisie," joined the united front to fight against domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism. The foundation of the national united front is the alliance of the working class and the laboring peasants under the leadership of the working class.
    "Overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries -- Mao Zedong wrote -- mainly depends on the strength of these two classes. The transition from new democracy to socialism mainly relies on the alliance of these two classes. The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the most foresight, is selfless, and has the most revolutionary thoroughness. The entire revolutionary history proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail. With the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed. In the age of imperialism, no other class in any country can lead any real revolution to victory.

　　殖民地人民民族解放运动中工人阶级的领导作用
    马斯连尼科夫著  周同译
    列宁与斯大林树立了社会主义革命的与殖民地民族革命的完备学说。其基石之一是这两大革命中的无产阶级的领导作用。“只有无产阶级能成为——列宁写道——为民主主义彻底斗争的战士，只有在那样的条件下无产阶级才能成为为民主主斗争的常胜战士，即农民群众联合于其革命斗争中。”（注一）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命之所以胜利，是因为在该革命中是以俄罗斯的革命的工人阶级与其富于政治战斗经验的先锋队——布尔什维克党为首的；它所以胜利，是因为俄罗斯的工人阶级在革命中有贫农这一重要同盟者，而贫农则是俄国农民人口中的绝大多数。俄国革命斗争的经验对于各殖民地半殖民地与附属国的人民之民族解放斗争具有巨大意义。
    战后民族解放运动的成就，特别是摧毁了国民党反动集团，创建了中华人民共和国的中国人民的历史的胜利，乃是列宁、斯大林的殖民地民族革命学说，无产阶级在这一革命中的领导作用的学说的胜利之极其鲜明的写照。
    十月革命后压迫殖民地的稳定时代业已过去
    斯大林同志曾指示出，伟大的十月革命之后，对殖民地与附属国剥削与压迫的稳定时代已经过去了，到来了的是各殖民地与附属国的解放革命时代，是这些国家的无产阶级觉醒的时代，是无产阶级领导这个革命的时代。“……十月革命开辟了一个新时代，即世界各被压迫国人民与无产阶级联盟并在无产阶级领导下进行殖民地革命的时代。”（注二）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在沙俄打断了殖民地民族压迫的锁链，并一视同仁地解放了我国的各被压迫民族。“正因为殖民地民族革命在我国是由无产阶级领导和在国际主义旗帜下进行的，所以素被贱视的民族，素被奴役的民族，也就破天荒第一次在人类史上升到了真正自由和真正平等的民族地位，并以身作则来鼓舞着全世界一切被压迫民族。”（注三）各殖民地与半殖民地国家的被压迫民族在反帝斗争中获致了苏联这一支助与可靠的友人。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命后，各被压迫民族的民族解放运动逐渐增强，经常地振撼着帝国主义的后方。斯大林同志对资本主义的总危机作了经典的断定，指出其特性中的基本标志之一为：“帝国主义战争与苏联革命的胜利紊乱了殖民地与附属国内的帝国主义制度，帝国主义在这些国家内的权威已被损毁，它已再没有力量像以往那样宰割这些国家了。”（注四）
    东南亚，近东与非洲各殖民地与附属国各民族的为自由与独立反对帝国主义压迫的斗争，显示了各不同国度内的各不同的形式与规模。这个不同是被决定于：这些国度内的阶级力量之对比、它们的工业发展程度、无产阶级的自觉力与组织力水平、无产阶级争取民族解放运动中的领导权及争取同盟者，首先是争取组成殖民地与半殖民地大多数人口的农民的斗争之成就的。
    在一二两次世界大战之间，中国在被压迫民族的革命运动中间，占了主要地位。
    中国革命的特点是两条路线的斗争
    斯大林同志非常注意中国的革命问题。他曾指示中国革命的特点是两条路线的斗争：民族资产阶级道路，这条路是企图击破无产阶级，和帝国主义妥协，共同来反对革命，以便于用建立资本主义的统治来终止革命；另一条路是无产阶级的道路，其追求的目的是把民族资产阶级抛在一边并巩固自己的领导权，领导城市与农村的亿万劳动群众来克服民族资产阶级的反抗，以便达到资产阶级民主革命的彻底胜利，进而逐渐将此革命引上社会主义革命的轨道。
    争取并巩固无产阶级的领导权，遂行民主革命并为社会主义建设创造条件，完成这些任务是需要长期并顽强的斗争的。
    中国共产党在这一斗争中，依靠了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，依靠了联共（布）的伟大的历史的经验。在一九四九年七月一日中共诞生二十八周年纪念，中共中央主席毛泽东在《论人民民主专政》一篇论文中写道：“我们要和国内外党内外的敌人作战。谢谢马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，他们给了我们以武器。这武器不是机关枪，而是马克思列宁主义。……中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁、斯大林，也不知道马克思、恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题，走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”（注五）
    外国帝国主义在中国的基本支柱是封建军阀。外国帝国主义者们利用这些或那些军阀们在中国进行扩张自己的势力范围的斗争。封建残余统治了中国，他们加重军事压迫与官僚专横。反动的政府为了取悦外国资本，而窒息了民族工业。当第一次世界大战年代相当地增加了自己的资本扩大了生产的中国工业资产阶级，是处在与外国帝国主义者对立的地位。帝国主义者在当时为了自己的企业，是宁愿利用买办的商业资本的。在这些条件下，民族资产阶级为了自己的利益站在反帝反封建军阀集团的统一战线的斗争行列内。
    工人与农民的反封建官僚的压迫，反军阀与反帝的革命斗争在中国恰开始于俄国十月革命与第一次世界大战终了之后。一九二一年中国共产党组成了，第二年它便领导了工人的同盟罢工斗争。这一斗争曾具有巨大的政治意义。如果中国共产党于其活动的第一步不建立广大无产阶级的有力的组织，如果这些组织——首先是职工联合会不在共产党的领导下，如果共产党未能获致为工人运动中的首脑并领导它依着革命的道路、依着它与社会主义联合的道路前进，则无产阶级在中国革命中的领导权是不可能的。一九二三年六月中国共产党第三次代表大会决议党加入国民党，此时共产党已有了对工人运动的革命领导的充实经验。此后，一九二四年国民党代表大会通过了孙逸仙的容纳农、工为国民党员的提议，这样，在中国创造了为建立反对外国帝国主义与反动军阀的统一战线的基础。
    斯大林同志指出，在殖民地革命的第一阶段上和民族资产阶级缔结统一阵线绝非标志着：共产党人不应该使工农反对地主与民族资产阶级的斗争尖锐化、无产阶级应该放弃自己的独立性，即使是最少的程度，即使是一分钟。“只有在那种情形之下，只有在那种条件之下统一战线才能有革命意义，就是假使它并不妨碍共产党进行自己政治的与组织的独立工作，组织无产阶级为独立的政治力量，唤起农民阶级反对地主，公开组织工人与农民的革命这样来为无产阶级的领导权准备条件。”（注六）
    中国的无产阶级在反对外国资本的同盟罢工斗争中巩固了自己的队伍并锻炼了自己，同时为扩大自己在广大劳动群众中的影响而斗争。无产阶级的党、他的前进的与组织的队伍成长并巩固了。如果一九二五年中国共产党有二千党员，那末一九二七年中国共产党的党员已增到六万了。在这几年中共产党领导了规模极大的同盟罢工战斗；党已获致把职工联合会的数量特别增加。假如一九二五年中共发起的中国第一次职工代表大会出席的代表们代表了二百三十万中国的组织工人，那末在一九二七年参加职工会组织的工人已达三百万人了。革命运动吸引了中国的亿万农民。最后共产党竟能把整团、整师的人民军队吸收到自己这方面来，“……中国共产党竟能在这个时期中把无产阶级领导权的这个理想从愿望变成事实。……”（注七）——斯大林写道。
    共产党在民族解放运动中争取无产阶级领导权的斗争之获致成功之所以异于他国者，是由于中国的资产阶级软弱与没有组织。大的民族资产阶级恐惧劳动者的革命运动的规模，转往反革命阵营。资产阶级依靠着外国帝国主义者的援助企图把革命停止于“第一步”，以便于随即扼杀它。但是依靠外国帝国主义者而攫得了国家政权的中国资产阶级却未能停滞中国革命。
    中国无产阶级领导着反帝反封建革命
    “假使第一阶段的特点是革命的尖头主要针对着反帝国主义，那末第二阶段的特点就是这一个事实：革命把自己的尖头主要针对着反对内部敌人，首先是反对封建领主，反封建制度。”（注八）
    瓦解英、美帝国主义代理者的大买办民族资产阶级并与之作残酷斗争乃是中国工人阶级在革命的第二阶段的极其重要的任务。中国革命进入其发展的高级形势，土地革命形势。土地革命采取了极宽泛的尺度并也十分吓怕了以国民党武汉政府为代表的小资产阶级的知识分子，他们也转往反革命阵营了。这标志了革命遭受了暂时的失败。“但是因此——斯大林同志指示道——它就把广大农民群众与城市贫民更紧密地团结到无产阶级的周围，并以此为无产阶级的领导权创造了基础。”（注九）
    在中国共产党领导下的农民游击战争运动的基础上，千千万万的红军建立起来了，民主政权的最初根据地在中国产生了。在代表六千万人的第一次全中国苏维埃代表大会上，于一九三一年十一月成立了中国的新民主主义政权——苏维埃政权。革命政权的新机构是起义反对国民党的现存政权的机构，是为新的、民主政权斗争的机构。同时它们也是在中国实行资产阶级民主革命、土地革命的机构，此一革命尚远未完成。新的、民主的政权在其反对反革命的国民党的斗争中，对全国一切前进分子成了威力十足的革命的引力中心。日本进犯中国后，中国红军为了建立并巩固民族统一战线，曾经改组为人民解放军，并变为反日本占领者斗争的主要力量。
    当一九三七到一九四五年中日战争期间，由中国人民解放军与游击部队从日本占领者手中解放出来的地区，其上所建立的民主政权是全人民的政权。它获到了不只是民主区域的而且是全中国人民的信任与拥护。工业企业在解放区内转为全人民的财产；农民获得了土地；资本家、地主与外国帝国主义的政权被清算了；以在共产党领导下的工人阶级为首的人民中的劳动阶层的联盟，成了基本领导力量。中国人民首次以自己的经验相信人民民主政权真代表着自己。
    中国工人阶级的领导力量已通过了历史的考验
    第二次世界大战将终时，中国共产党的领导范围已扩张到拥有一亿四千万人口的十八个解放区。共产党赢得了全国多数人民的巨大威信与尊敬。中国工人阶级的领导权与其对农民的领导力量不只是已被争取到，而且通过了历史的考验。
    在广大的中国领土上由中国共产党所领导展开了的土地革命过程中，提高了无产阶级在民族解放斗争中的领导作用，增长了它在农民群众中的影响。在中国革命的这一阶段上，共产党不仅把无产阶级与农民而且也把民族资产阶级中的民主阶层也吸引到争取国家民主化的斗争中来。
    中国在一二两次世界大战之间，占各殖民地与半殖民地人民的革命运动中的前锋地位。但那时帝国主义锁链也形成了许多其他弱的环节，在这些弱的环节中对帝国主义者的统治产生了严重的威胁。在此一时期印度人民的民族解放运动达到了高峰。
    印度的无产阶级在数量上占各殖民地国家中较多的一位。如果一九二七年中国产业工人总数，据中国调查资料，不超过一百五十万人，则在同年印度城市无产阶级已超过三百五十万人。恰如在中国一样，在印度参加民族解放斗争的不只是产业工人。亿万农民、小制造厂、做坊的千百万手工业者、码头工人、苦力、人力车夫与其他城市贫民均成为群众革命斗争的积极参加者，当然更有组织有纪律的产业工人是该斗争的狙击兵。
    印度无产阶级自十九世纪末，亦即颇早于中国，已积极地参加了同盟罢工斗争，这些斗争常变为政治斗争。一九○五年印度纺织工人举行了罢工，反对资本家延长工作时间的企图。一九○六年孟加拉铁路工人揭起了政治性的总罢工；一九○七年五月旁遮普（Punjab）铁路工人拒绝运输英帝国主义派往镇压农民暴动的军队。一九○八年列宁关于印度纺织工人的政治总罢工写道：“即在印度，无产阶级已成长到自觉的政治性的群众斗争了。”（注十）
    印度无产阶级已成为独立的政治力量
    一九一八到一九二二年印度工人运动已获致广大规模。与印度空前有力的大罢工同时，产生了群众示威游行与劳动者大会。一九一九年阿木利塞尔城（Amritsar在印度北部，临近克什米尔现属巴基斯坦——译者）工人示威游行遭受血的射击后，民族解放运动普及了全国。在一九三○——一九三二年革命高潮的时期，以及在第二次世界大战的前夕，印度的无产阶级开始成为独立的政治力量。印度农民运动的范围也扩张了，一九一九——一九二二年、以及一九三○——一九三二年农民运动已在一系列地方举行武装起义，破坏地主财产，没收地主谷物。印度人民给资本主义体系的后方以严重打击，其斗争帮助了国际无产阶级搅乱了帝国主义的阵营。
    但印度的革命运动就其规模与成就讲是远落于中国革命运动之后的。印度工人阶级在革命运动争取自己的领导权的斗争，没有得到像中国的工人阶级那样的成就。印度工人阶级在革命运动中争取自己的领导权时遇到了不列颠帝国主义这样极强的敌手，它在其指挥所及的范围内用尽一切方法来压迫并分裂民族解放运动。
    不列颠帝国主义采用残酷与血腥的恐怖及一切镇压手段来反对殖民地与半殖民地各民族的民族解放运动，并于同时广泛地利用资产阶级的民族改良主义。民族改良主义——在殖民地与半殖民地中其代表者为民族资产阶级——和一切改良主义一样，拒绝从帝国主义压迫下解放国家的革命道路。民族改良主义者欺骗劳动者，肯定着以逐渐实现改良的方法似乎就能够到达自由与独立。
    中国革命的宝贵经验
    中国共产党经过了多年的斗争，达成了粉碎民族改良主义并把它的代表者——民族资产阶级与城市小资产阶级——与工人阶级与农民广大群众隔离起来。“………民族资产阶级——毛泽东于上引的论文中写道——不能充当革命的领导者，也不能在国家政权中占主要的地位。民族资产阶级之所以不能充当革命的领导者，和所以不应当在国家政权机关中占主要地位，是因为民族资产阶级的社会经济地位规定了他们的软弱性，他们缺乏远见，缺乏足够的勇气，并且有不少的人害怕民众。孙中山主张“唤起民众”，或“扶助工农”，谁去“唤起”和“扶助”呢？孙中山的意思是说小资产阶级及民族资产阶级。但这在事实上是办不到的。孙中山的四十年革命是失败了，这是什么原因呢？在帝国主义时代，资产阶级不能领导任何真正的革命到胜利，原因就在此。我们的二十八年，就大不相同。我们有许多宝贵的经验。一个有纪律的有马、恩、列、斯的理论武装的采取自我批评方法的联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶层各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是主要的经验。这些都是我们区别于前人的，依靠这三件，使我们取得了基本的胜利。我们走过了曲折的道路。我们曾和党内的机会主义倾向作斗争，右的和左的。”（注十一）
    印度社会改良主义残余势力仍起作用
    民族改良主义在中国从未曾有像在印度那样的有力的影响。中国大资产阶级的势力曾于北伐及国共合作时期增强。但当它叛变了民族革命并公开地变为英美帝国主义的反动代理人之后，这个势力马上就消失了。同时数量可观的被帝国主义与巨大的官僚资本压迫的中国的小资产阶级与中产阶级亦逐渐和中共领导的革命统一阵线紧密地联接起来。
    民族改良主义在印度是自一八八五年国民会议成立后而开始巩固并扩展其势力的。印度资产阶级与地主中的自由分子联盟企图在殖民地压迫制度的范围里、以渐进改良的方法来巩固其经济阵地，并使群众相信革命斗争的“不适当”。印度民族资产阶级传播着以改良道路到达独立与“用帝国主义者的手反殖民地化”的可能的妄想，在印度劳动群众中保存了势力。
    还在一九二五年斯大林同志就指出印度的资产阶级已分裂为革命派与妥协派，资产阶级的妥协分子已能够在基本上和帝国主义取得妥协。斯大林同志关于这个着重指出印度资产阶级中的妥协分子和帝国主义结盟，来反对本国的工人与农民。“不打破这个联盟，革命胜利是不能达到的。但是为了打破这个联盟，须要集中火力反对妥协的民族资产阶级，揭穿它的叛逆行为，从它的影响下把劳动群众解放出来，并系统地准备为无产阶级的领导权所必需的条件。换句话说，是这样，即在像印度这样的殖民地内，准备使无产阶级进向解放运动中的领袖地位，一步复一步地从此一神圣地位铲除资产阶级与其发言者。任务是要组成革命的反帝联盟并保证此联盟中的无产阶级领导权。”（注十二）
    斯大林同志教导着，共产党的独立性“应该是共产主义的前进分子的基本口号，因为只有共产党能够准备并实现无产阶级的领导权。”（注十三）当时印度尚未组成共产党。一九二五年组成的工农党是联合当时印度国内的各共产主义集团的第一个组织，但该组织中包括了小资产阶级知识分子的代表，其中还有左派社会改良主义者。民族资产阶级的代理人社会改良主义者钻进了工人阶级里，高谈民主主义与社会主义，企图使工人阶级接受民族资产阶级的影响。社会改良主义的影响表现于印度共产主义组织的活动上、职工会的组织与其领导政策上。加入工农党组织中的个别集团内发生了派别斗争。一九二八年开除了在党内鼓动派别斗争的叛徒罗易，使情势好转。但是社会改良主义的残余此后仍起作用。印度职工组织自一九一二至一九二○年奠基之后，资产阶级分子及其中的社会改良主义者马上就取得了主脑地位，他们实行妥协政策。一九二九年印度职工运动发生分裂，一九三一年国内组成了三个职工的领导中央：以右派改良主义者为首的全印度职工工会联合会、“左”派领导下的全印度职工联合大会与统一印度无产阶级各革命组织的红色职工大会。印度工人运动的分裂明显地说明了印度劳动者反帝斗争的进一步发展，这个斗争带有组织不健全的特点。
    一九三三年年末，在印度联合前此产生的各共产主义集团成立了统一的共产党。自此时起，印度的工人阶级在共产党的领导下开始以独立的力量步入政坛，实质上、首次为民族解放运动中的领导权进行反资产阶级斗争。一九三五年红色职工大会与全印度职工大会合并组成印度统一职工大会，国内职工运动的力量与规模大大地增强了。在群众中共产党的力量的增长惊动了英帝国主义者与印度资产阶级中的他们的走狗。一九三四年宣布了印度共产党是非法的。
    第二次世界大战前夕印度革命斗争又高涨了。罢工运动包括了广大工人群众，资本家时时被迫而让步。孟加拉制麻工业工人、加布尔纺织工人、铁路工人等举行罢工。工人阶级在斗争中把自己锻炼成为印度反帝力量中的最有组织与威力的队伍。共产党人的在印度建立反帝统一战线的理想，在绝大多数被压迫的劳动者间唤起了共鸣与赞助。一九三六年诞生了基本上在共产党人领导下的新的农民联盟。
    印共反帝统一战线获得劳动人民共鸣
    一九四二年经过了八年长期的地下生存、共产党变成了合法的。共产党的公开与它和群众联系的巩固促成了党的成长与组织的巩固。党员的数量自一九四二年的四千到一九四三年发展到一万六千人。一九四三年印度共产党第一次全国代表大会召开，大会确认了党的影响已异常强大，不只是在工人中，而且在农民与知识分子中。
    但是共产党的旧领导还未从改良主义的影响下解放出来，这个影响表现在第二次世界大战时党的政策上。关于分割印度以及关于承认印度与巴基斯坦自治领的条文之“蒙巴顿计划”不是别的，正是英帝国主义与印度资产阶级的上层分子的协定，是这些自治领依属于英帝国主义的经济的与政治的新形式。最初印度共产党的领导评定它是某一“前进一步”的方式，而没有把它看成为英帝国主义向印度人民进攻的新形式。印度分成两个自治领后，党的领导决议支持尼赫鲁的资产阶级政府及从“甘地到共产党人”组成民族统一战线的“合理性”。此一改良主义路线为一九四八年二月到三月间开的第二次印度共产党代表大会讨论并以坚决的批评推翻了。
    这就是第一、二两次世界大战间及第二次世界大战末东方两大国家的工人阶级在民族解放运动中争取领导作用的斗争之发展经过。在列宁、斯大林关于殖民地民族解放的学说指导下的以共产党为首的工人阶级、于中、印两国亿万人民的争取民族自由与独立斗争中成了主力。
  二次世界大战后苏联国际威信增长
    第二次世界大战后苏联的隆兴与国际威信难以计算地增长起来。在卫国战争中苏维埃人民的伟大胜利以新的力量向全世界证实了：社会主义凌驾于资本主义之上。苏军的作战与胜利的总结扩大了帝国主义的世界体系之裂口；从此裂口脱出了中欧与东南欧一系列国家——迈向建设社会主义基础的道路的人民民主国家。被压迫民族的反帝革命战线获得了较以前更强大的支擎。
    向全世界揭穿英美集团的侵略政策与罪恶行动的苏联，它对各殖民地与附属国的民族解放斗争之迅速发展上所给与的援助与支持实具有难以评价的意义。从满洲与北朝鲜驱逐了日本侵据者的苏军预防了帝国主义者对这些地区的干涉并阻碍了反革命势力在那里攫得政权。这样、苏联人民不只是把中、鲜人民从日本侵略者的枷锁中解放出来，并在中国与北朝鲜奠定了为人民民主制之组成与巩固的顺利条件。
    “假如没有苏联的存在，——毛泽东写道——假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，对于我们说来特别是打倒了日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们的反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要多几多倍，在这样情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。”（注十四）
    帝国主义阵营矛盾异常尖锐化
    各帝国主义国家的发展不平衡性之无比强化与随之而来的无可避免的它们中间的新的尖锐的矛盾、纠纷与争议，对于第二次世界大战后殖民地与半殖民地民族解放运动具有巨大意义。从战争与人民鲜血上发了横财的美帝国主义，企图适应第二次世界大战后帝国主义势力对比的变化来改变世界，美国垄断资本在为奠定其世界统治的斗争中经常与战后衰弱了的帝国主义掠夺者们的利益发生矛盾。帝国主义营垒中的主要矛盾——英美帝国主义的矛盾——异常尖锐化起来了。
    在战争期间英国与其殖民地的关系消弱了；在战时经济中它依赖美国粮食与工业品的供应。战后英帝国主义虽然重返它的殖民地，但它在那里遇到了已形扩张了的美国势力。美国资本日益广泛地钻入不列颠帝国的各国中；在他们的贸易中美国现已差不多就占着如英国的地位。美国不把英国从财政经济附庸的羁绊内放出去，并逐渐自其手中夺去殖民地的管制权，把它从以前的“势力范围”内赶出去，并贬它为自己的臣仆。法国、比利时、荷兰的殖民地宝座日益动摇，各主要欧洲帝国主义宗主国之“马歇尔化”日益把他们变为美国的藩属。虽然如此，英、法、荷、比帝国主义者还在反对美国资本繁殖于它们的殖民地内，并企图于殖民地中巩固自己的固有地位。所有这些引起了殖民地中帝国主义的全部阵线之极端不稳定并异常脆弱。同时，各帝国主义者在美帝国主义者的庇护下当触及镇压各被压迫民族解放运动时却是一致的。
    第二次世界大战给各殖民地、半殖民地与附属国的民族工业发展以机会。战时殖民地世界中工业生产的扩大是有条件限制的，一方面、断绝了自宗主国必需的食粮与日用必需品的输入。另方面宗主国为作战所必需的军事原料与其他需要则在增强。这促使殖民地发展采矿，原料工业，在原料出产地建设属于帝国主义者的军事工厂基地。同时，也增加作坊式的小型工业的数量，产生了家庭工业与手工业。但是，在许多殖民地与附属国中的某些工业虽然发展，却和往昔一样仍处于殖民地的状态。“这是帝国主义的特别方法——即在殖民地中发展工业，是为了把他系于宗主国、帝国主义的绳索上。”（注十五）
    殖民地与半殖民地内工业的发展具有畸形及偏向的特点。但同时它也引起了民族无产阶级的增长。印度无产阶级差不多增加了一百万人。同时在殖民地中发生了农民阶级强烈分化的过程，扩大了农业无产阶级。
    帝国主义勾结买办资产阶级加紧吸榨财富
    大战期间帝国主义的殖民地与半殖民地吸取去大量财富，殖民地居民被陷于饥饿与死亡。
    帝国主义列强——宗主国加紧对殖民地的掠夺与剥削，更尖锐化了各该殖民地与半殖民地内的矛盾。帝国主义者企图扩大他在殖民地国家内的社会基础，加强拉拢大民族资产阶级到他们那方面去，作为他们吸榨财富与更广泛奴役殖民地人民的工具。地方大资产阶级统治集团在帝国主义者的帮助下成了殖民地与半殖民地中的反民主斗争的中心。这些民族资产阶级集团在某些国家里、如在印度与中国，在帝国主义者的支持下变成了巨大的独占的、买办的联合。
    中国的“四大家族”——蒋介石、陈立夫、宋子文与孔祥熙——就是这种独占联盟的鲜明例子。在国民党的中国中一切政治权与经济权都属于他们。他们由于美帝国主义的援助把巨大资金与自然财源均集中于自己的手中。他们不只是采用资本主义的，而且还采用资本主义以前的剥削方式，他们已成为和国家机关及和外国资本紧密结合的巨大金融资本的极典型的代表。
    印度的独占联合也和中国的一样于战时获得了巨利，增强了他的经济力量。毕尔拉、塔塔、达尔米亚等公司的指挥者对反英大会的决议，虽未曾表示反对，但在实质上他们曾是并依然是英国资本在印度的代理人与同盟者。印度大资产阶级对于外国帝国主义者在印度的统治是有利的。它关切着借助于英帝国主义从事反人民运动斗争。它为了自己的阶级利益背叛了民族解放斗争。印度资产阶级帮助英帝国主义者于战后在印度建立一种制度，在表面“独立”的形式下，依然保留着英国独占资本对居民的毫未变易的殖民地性的剥削。
    大民族资产阶级与外国帝国主义的紧密结合也发生在其他各殖民地与附属国内。妥协的资产阶级集团是各被压迫民族的民族解放运动的敌人和窒息者。他们和帝国主义者组织国内战争反对本国的前进的民主力量。
    各殖民地民主反帝阵线在发展壮大
    第二次世界大战后许多殖民地与半殖民地的无产阶级已被认为民族解放运动的领导者。在各殖民地与附属国内劳动农民与城市小资产阶级自大资产阶级影响下的解放会以并正在以急骤的速度发展着。现在共产党在许多半殖民地及殖民地国家中——越南、缅甸、马来亚、印尼及其他——把广大人民的各阶层统一于其领导下的民主反帝阵线。
    在东方数亿中国人民——人民胜利者走在革命的民族解放运动的前列。在美帝国主义支持下的反动的封建的资产阶级蒋介石反动集团，于第二次世界大战后，立刻就把中国推入血腥的国内战争。国民党政府拒绝了代表无产阶级劳动农民与小资产阶级及中等民族资产阶级的爱国集团的利益的中国共产党与其他民主党派所提出的中国民主化。这一人民的要求，向工人阶级及其领袖——共产党、其利益的保护者——中国人民解放军进攻。一九四六年由美国装备的国民党军队在数量上超过人民解放军三倍。但不到二年，蒋介石的基本力量已被击碎。到一九四九年六月国民党军队丧失了五百五十万人以上。中国将近百分之六十的人口已从封建、资产阶级的反动的国民党政府下被解放出来。截至一九四九年十月中国绝大多数的人民已被解放，十月一日宣布成立了中华人民共和国，选举了以共产党领袖毛泽东为首的中央人民政府。在工人阶级领导下的中国人民的多年斗争完成了伟大的历史胜利。地球上的四亿七千五百万居民从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来，开始向社会主义的道路迈进。
    中国人民的这些胜利的决定因素是在战斗中锻炼出来的中国共产党的领导作用，中国共产党依着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，获到把中国人民团结于工人阶级的周围，于革命的人民解放军周围，粉碎了国民党反动集团的反人民的、反民族的背叛政策。
    民族统一阵线基础是工农联盟
    中国共产党与人民解放军获致了全体人民的敬戴、拥护与爱慕。在国内建立了就广度与深度言为前史所未有的民族统一战线，此一战线联合了工人、农民、城市小资产阶级、少数民族与工商业的中产阶级中的某些阶层。中国的小资产阶级与中产阶级遭受了反动的大资产阶级地主阶级与握在垄断资本手中的国民党政权的压迫与排挤，小资产阶级与中产阶级没有或很少有与帝国主义有关系，这就是此一资产阶级、按毛泽东所作的定义为“真正的民族资产阶级”及加入反国内反动分子与外国帝国主义斗争的统一战线的原因。民族统一战线的基础是在工人阶级领导下的工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟。
    “推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，——毛泽东写道——主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利。在帝国主义时代，任何国家的任何别的阶级，都不能领导任何真正的革命达到胜利。中国民族资产阶级曾经多次领导过革命，都失败了，就是证明。”（注十六）
    中国革命胜利确证列宁斯大林学说的卓见
    中国革命的胜利又一次确证了列宁、斯大林的关于殖民地民族革命与这一革命中无产阶级领导权的必要之学说的卓见。
    战后印度民族解放运动的高涨也基于无产阶级在人民的民族解放运动中日益争取到领导作用。
    第二次世界大战后，印度民族资产阶级在群众中的影响已大见衰落，工人阶级的影响与力量则日益扩张。印度共产党员已增到九万人；共产党人在工、农与城市小资产阶级中巩固了自己的阵地与威信。人数约有八十万的全印度职工大会、已近八十万人的全印度农民组织以及全印度学联和其他前进的联盟与组织均处于共产党的影响下。
    一九四八年内印度发生了一千六百多次罢工。其中一大部分均带有政治性。罢工与工人的运动是反资产阶级对工人阶级的生活水平与政治权的进攻，反对反工人的立法，反对取消物价管制法与赋给政府非常权利的法案，反对迫害印度共产党的行为等等。
    由于工人阶级与其领袖——共产党——的领导作用，在越南的民族解放运动也获得成就，越南人民进行反对被美国统治集团所教唆与支持的法帝国主义。在缅甸也有无数游击军队活动着。在菲律宾进行着反对美帝国主义殖民者的游击战争，印尼与马来亚继续着为人民独立的武装斗争。所有这些都不是偶然的、自然爆发的，而是工人阶级与共产党领导下的人民群众的有组织与自觉的反帝与反国内反动分子的斗争。
    印尼民族解放斗争在复杂条件下行进着。在共产党的领导下印尼游击队不只是在爪哇与苏门答腊，并在印尼其他各岛上进行着反荷兰军的不屈不挠的武装斗争。
    无产阶级领导作用是殖民地革命胜利的关键
    在战争与其终结后的年月里，各殖民地与半殖民地民族解放运动中的无产阶级领导作用的巩固是决定该运动的广大规模与其决定性胜利的因素。
    在殖民地世界的所有国家中，无产阶级把农民阶级、知识分子、城市小资产阶级与部分民族资产阶级团结于自己的周围，这部分民族资产阶级是为自殖民地压迫下解放、为民族独立与自由进行反对帝国主义的。同时共产党进行坚决的不调和的反帝国主义的代理者的民族改良主义的斗争，这些改良主义者是企图一方面向各国的民族解放运动的个别队伍中以及殖民地与半殖民地民族解放运动中另一方面向国际民主阵营与社会主义阵营中打入一个楔子。美帝的仆从们——贝文与勃鲁姆——为了拯救殖民地帝国的彻底毁灭，以播散叛逆的口号“第三条路线”的方法来毒害战斗中的殖民地人民的意识。各殖民地与半殖民地国家的共产党揭穿这个企图，与之进行不调和的斗争。“不但中国，——毛泽东写道——全世界也一样，不是倒向帝国主义，就是倒向社会主义，绝无例外。中立是伪装的，第三条道路是没有的。”（注十七）中国人民于多年的斗争过程中得到结论，即成功的极重要的条件：“联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民共同奋斗。这就是联合苏联、联合欧洲各新民主主义国家，联合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国际的统一战线。”（注十八）
    毛泽东“一边倒”道理的伟大
    忠实于国际主义传统的中国共产党及其他殖民地、半殖民地与附属国的共产党，给在国内建立恐怖、诱骗、奸细制的铁托法西斯反动集团、外国帝国主义的间谍们的雇佣奸细与蛊惑者们以可耻烙印。
    苏联人民于中国的民主主义之崇高胜利中看到马列主义的不可战胜的力量之凯旋。他们庆祝在工人阶级领导下的中国人民的伟大与长期斗争的历史总结——中华人民共和国成立。苏联政府首先承认了新生的中华人民共和国政府。
    进一步团结殖民地与半殖民地的各民族于共产党领导的并在列宁、斯大林旗帜下前进的工人阶级周围，是肃清帝国主义的殖民地奴役与压迫体系而斗争的胜利保证。
