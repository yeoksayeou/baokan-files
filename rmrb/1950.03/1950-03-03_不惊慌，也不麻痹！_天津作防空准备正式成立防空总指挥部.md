Don't Panic, But Don't Be Numb!
    Tianjin Makes Air Defense Preparations and Formally Establishes Air Defense Headquarters
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The people of Tianjin have been seriously alarmed by the bombings of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Qingdao by the Kuomintang bandit remnants under the command of the American imperialists, who have become violent after suffering crushing defeats in their aggression against China. In order to protect the country's production and construction, and to protect their own lives and property, they are actively carrying out various air defense works.
    On March 1st, the Tianjin Air Defense Headquarters was formally established. The headquarters immediately promulgated the "Air Defense Regulations" as well as air defense signals, air defense traffic control, and other measures.
    The air defense committees of some public and private factories have also been organized, and the protection of important machinery and equipment and the protection of personnel safety are underway. Many factories have prepared cellars, dug air-raid shelters, added fire extinguishers, buckets, sand, blackout curtains, etc., and have begun to remove flammable materials.
    Hospitals have established rescue organizations and prepared emergency medicines and necessary stretchers.
    Schools have also established various protection organizations. Movie theaters have begun to add fire extinguishers and assign special personnel to manage the emergency exits.
    The Tianjin Daily published an editorial entitled "Don't Be Numb, Don't Panic, Prevent Enemy Air Raids," pointing out that "complacent thoughts" and a numb attitude still exist; many government organs, enterprises, and schools have not actively acted, or although they have some air defense equipment, it does not meet the requirements. The newspaper called on the Communist Party members in Tianjin to demonstrate their responsibility to the people and the country and to be models for the masses in the anti-bombing struggle; and called on the glorious workers and students of Tianjin, who have always been the main force of the Tianjin people in overcoming difficulties and completing the political tasks of each period, to quickly organize themselves and carry out various preparations for air defense and rescue.

　　不惊慌，也不麻痹！
    天津作防空准备正式成立防空总指挥部
    【本报讯】天津人民对于侵略中国着着惨败而狂暴起来的美帝国主义指挥下的国民党残匪对上海、南京、杭州、青岛的轰炸，引起了严重警惕，他们为了保卫国家的生产建设，保卫自己的生命财产，正积极地进行着各种防空工作。
    三月一日天津市防空总指挥部正式成立。该部立即颁布了“防空规则”以及防空信号、防空时交通管制等办法。
    一部分公私营工厂的防空委员会也组织起来了，重要机器设备的防护工作，和人员安全的防护工作都正在开始。许多工厂已经准备好了窑窖，挖了防空壕，添置了灭火器、水桶、砂土、遮光帘等等，并开始清除易燃物品。
    医院里成立了救护组织，准备了救急药品及必要的担架。
    学校里也成立了各种防护组织。电影院开始添置灭火器，派专人管理太平门。
    天津日报以《不麻痹，不惊慌，预防敌机侵袭》为题，发表了社论，指出“太平思想”，麻痹观念还是存在的；许多机关企业学校还没有积极动作起来，或虽有一些防空设备，还不合要求。该报号召天津市的共产党员，发挥对人民对国家负责的态度，在反轰炸斗争中要做群众的表率；并号召一向是天津人民克服困难，完成每一时期政治任务的主力军——光荣的天津工人和学生们，迅速组织起来，进行防空与救护等各项准备工作。
