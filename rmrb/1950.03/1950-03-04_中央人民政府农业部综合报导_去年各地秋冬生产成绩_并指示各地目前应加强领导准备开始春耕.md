　　Comprehensive Report by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
    Achievements of Autumn and Winter Production in Various Regions Last Year
    Instructions to All Regions to Strengthen Leadership and Prepare to Start Spring Plowing
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued a comprehensive report on the achievements of wheat planting, autumn plowing, and winter production in various regions in 1949, and pointed out various matters that should be noted in the preparation for spring plowing. Regarding wheat planting: In the autumn of 1949, there was a lot of rain and the land was wet, which was suitable for wheat planting. Many areas suffered from floods last autumn and experienced poor harvests, leading to grain shortages for farmers. In order to alleviate the grain shortage, all regions seized the opportunity to plant wheat, resulting in an expansion of wheat fields. For example, the planting area in Hebei Province was 25.3 million mu (including some spring wheat) the year before last. Last year, the planting area reached 32.23 million mu, exceeding the year before last by approximately 27.3%. According to statistics from eight provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Jiangxi (with Jiangsu and Anhui being estimated figures), a total of 242.06 million mu of wheat was planted, accounting for 42.3% of the total cultivated land area of 568.38 million mu in these eight provinces. In areas severely affected by floods, a considerable amount of land has not yet been drained. Efforts are being made to drain the water this spring, and a batch of spring wheat may be planted. In Hebei Province, wheat yellow dwarf disease occurred the year before last. According to a survey of 16 villages in Qingyuan County with severe yellow dwarf disease, the affected area reached 75%, and diseased seedlings accounted for 30%. Measures are currently being taken to prevent and control the disease.
    All regions implemented intensive cultivation and meticulous farming in wheat fields, which was improved compared to 1948. In old liberated areas, fertilizer application was generally increased by about 10%. For example, the average fertilizer application in Shanxi Province reached 40 to 50 dan per mu. In terms of cultivation, wheat fields in Shanxi were plowed more than twice on average, most areas in Hebei were plowed twice, and Pingyuan and Shandong were plowed once. In terms of pest and disease control, Shandong carried out seed replacement, seed soaking, and the use of clean manure to prevent wheat bunt. Shanxi carried out seed soaking to prevent wheat diseases, with 30% to 70% of seeds being soaked in 15 counties including Changzhi. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions also purchased arsenolite and arsenolite concentrate, ferrous sulfate, and other agents to provide farmers with insecticides to kill mole crickets. In cotton-producing areas, cotton fields were planned and reserved in conjunction with cotton price policies. In disaster areas, vigorous efforts were made to drain water, lend wheat seeds, and plant large amounts of wheat, which stabilized the emotions of disaster victims.
    Regarding autumn plowing: Before and after wheat planting, the provinces in North China conducted autumn plowing under leadership. Banks provided loans for plowing cattle. Leading organs at all levels personally inspected and solved problems. The number of draft animals increased in various regions, and labor-pulling plows, hoeing, labor-animal cooperation, and exchange of grass and fodder were organized to overcome the difficulty of the lack of draft animals, and the task of universal plowing once was generally completed. In Hebei Province, the area plowed once reached 87.2%, Suiyuan reached 83%, and the old liberated areas of Shanxi were universally plowed once, with new liberated areas reaching 70%. It is estimated that the universal plowing in the entire North China region reached more than 85%, exceeding the 74% in 1948 by 11%. However, there are imbalances in various regions. For example, universal plowing in Qinyang County, Pingyuan Province, only reached 38%. Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei only reached 63%. Shandong reached 47%. And Luzhongnan only reached 18%. Therefore, organizing land cultivation this spring is still a serious task.
    The main reasons for achieving the above results are that the war in these areas has ended, and livestock and manpower can be widely mobilized and投入into the production movement. After years of pest control lessons, the masses have realized the importance of autumn plowing. In addition, leading organs in various regions attach great importance to this work. The old liberated areas have transferred many cadres to go deep into the field to inspect and promote the work. For example, the deputy commissioner of Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi and the deputy secretary of the local committee of the Communist Party personally went to the countryside to inspect and promote the work.
    Secondly, the leadership seriously helped the masses organize labor-pulling plows, hoeing, labor-animal cooperation, exchange of grass and fodder, lent large amounts of wheat seeds and agricultural agents, and organized technical cadres to go to the countryside to guide seed soaking, etc. These measures ensured the completion of the wheat planting and autumn plowing tasks.
    In terms of winter production, various regions have also made considerable achievements. For example, in agricultural production, various regions have taken various effective measures to ensure the successful completion of this year's grain and cotton production increase tasks. Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar in North China, as well as Subei and Shandong in East China, have all made considerable achievements. First of all, it is manifested in fertilizer accumulation. According to statistics from 41 counties including Changzhi in Shanxi, this year's fertilizer application can be increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year (the average fertilizer application last year was about 45 dan in old liberated areas and 34 dan in new liberated areas). At the same time, attention has been paid to the quality of fertilizer. Various regions have also helped families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to accumulate fertilizer, requiring them to achieve the average amount of fertilizer application on their cultivated land. In terms of fertilizer sources, urban manure has been valued by various regions. For example, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua in Chahar Province organized the transportation of a large amount of garbage and manure to the countryside. In Shajiazhuang, Wanquan, 45 households dug out more than 260 carts of manure from Wanquan in less than a month. Beijing plans to lend 20 million catties of dried manure from the city to farmers in the suburbs. Areas around Jiangsu actively dug river mud to prepare large amounts of fertilizer. In terms of water conservancy, Hebei Province has a plan to dig 50,000 wells, promote 70,000 waterwheels, and expand paddy fields by 1.5 million mu, which is being actively carried out. Currently, 1,716 brick kilns are rushing to burn well bricks, and 344 waterwheel factories are rushing to manufacture waterwheels. Various counties are organizing the lending of waterwheels and well-digging work. Cheng'an County had already dug 530 wells by late November last year. Shanxi's million-mu winter irrigation plan had reached 690,000 mu by the end of December. Pingyuan's Jiyuan, Boai, and other counties have completed 29 large and small drainage rivers. The second phase of the Yi River diversion project in Subei, the Shu River diversion project in Shandong, the repair of dikes in northern Anhui, the repair of breaches in Poyang Lake in Jiangxi, Dongting Lake in Hunan, and Jianghan in Hubei have all begun. In terms of repairing and replenishing agricultural tools, the supply and marketing cooperative in Shanxi Province used 9 million catties of rice to manage and support the famous Yincheng and Yangquan ironware agricultural tool industries in North China, which have been greatly developed. According to statistics from the Huguan area near Yincheng, the number of large and small blast furnaces has increased from five last year to 34 this year, an increase of nearly seven times. 19 counties in Shanxi Province have added 100,000 pieces of agricultural tools. The plans of Chahar Province to produce 140,000 pieces of agricultural tools and Pingyuan Province to increase agricultural tools by 1 million pieces are all being actively carried out. The close combination of winter production and spring plowing preparation work, as well as the insufficient attention paid to spring plowing preparation work in some areas, should still be noted by the leadership in various regions.
    There has been great development in winter sideline production and disaster relief.熬硝in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and Northeast China, fishing in Hebei, Pingyuan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei, the output of medicinal materials, walnuts, ironware, and sulfur in Shanxi, the transportation of grain, hunting, and the output of oil and hemp skin in Northeast Chahar and Suiyuan, the transportation of grain in northern Shaanxi, and the production and marketing of local products such as土布, reed mats, and willow weaving in Hebei and Pingyuan have gradually been launched. This year's sideline production shows a brand-new feature, that is, the state-owned economy uses the method of signing contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to organize farmers' small-scale production, and gradually transitions from a wartime self-sufficient economic system to a more organized and planned economic system that adapts to domestic and foreign market needs. This contract system has begun to be launched in Northeast China, North China, Shandong, and other places, which has strongly promoted production and at the same time guaranteed the lives of most disaster victims. However, due to the enemy's blockade, the lack of recovery of domestic purchasing power, and the establishment of new urban-rural relations, there are still problems such as sluggish sales of sideline products and local products, and the lack of raw materials for certain productions. For example, it is difficult to promote the sales of local products and sideline products in Shandong. If the sales problem is solved, 1 billion to 1.5 billion catties of millet can be recovered, which can solve the livelihood problems of disaster victims. The sales of reed mats and土硝in the disaster areas of Hebei have also stagnated. Although the sales of土布in Gaoyang are not a problem, the lack of foreign yarn prevents it from being fully produced. At the same time, there is still blindness in sideline production. For example, the leadership of Huiji County in Bohai District, Shandong, lacked investigation and research, and blindly developed oil mills in peanut-producing areas (four districts), exceeding market demand, and was forced to shut down.
    At present, the development of winter production and spring plowing preparation work is unbalanced. Generally, in new liberated areas and non-disaster areas, there are more deployments and calls, and less specific organization and inspection, thus forming a spontaneous phenomenon. In the old liberated areas and disaster areas, there are still individual regions where the leadership does not pay enough attention, is busy with other work, and relaxes leadership, such as Liangshan County in Pingyuan. Some areas lack clear direction, such as Northeast China, which only mentions sideline production and not agriculture, while some areas only pay attention to agriculture and ignore sideline production. Some areas still have blindness, do not investigate, do not research, and formulate plans subjectively without regard to the national market and the needs of the masses. The above-mentioned deviations should be brought to the attention of the leadership in various regions and corrected quickly in the work. Now that the Spring Festival has passed, spring plowing preparation should be carried out immediately. How to closely combine winter sideline production with spring plowing preparation work, and also properly carry out sideline production during spring plowing, should also be brought to the attention of the leadership in various regions for research.

　　中央人民政府农业部综合报导
    去年各地秋冬生产成绩
    并指示各地目前应加强领导准备开始春耕
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部于最近综合报道一九四九年各地种麦、秋耕与冬季生产的成绩，并指出春耕准备工作中应注意的各种事项。在种麦方面：一九四九年秋季雨多地湿，宜于种麦。去秋不少地区因水灾歉收，农民缺粮。各地为了缩短粮荒，均抓紧种麦，因而麦田面积均有扩大。如河北省前年播种面积为二千五百三十万亩（包括部分春麦），去年播种达三千二百二十三万亩，超过前年约百分之二十七点三左右。据河北、山西、平原、山东、江苏、安徽、河南、江西八省的统计（其中江苏、安徽为估计数），共种麦二万四千二百零六万亩，占该八省总耕地面积五万六千八百三十八万亩的百分之四十二点三。水灾严重地区尚有相当数量的土地未能脱水，今春正努力排水，可能种一批春麦。河北省小麦前年秋发生黄疸病，据清苑县黄疸严重的十六村调查，病害面积达百分之七十五，病苗占百分之三十，现正在设法防治中。
    各地麦田实行精耕细作，均较一九四八年提高。在老区一般增施肥料一成左右，如山西省平均施肥量达每亩四十至五十担。在耕作上，山西麦地平均耕过两遍以上，河北大部耕两遍，平原、山东均耕了一遍。在病虫害防治上，山东为防止小麦腥黑穗病，进行了换种浸种与改用净粪。山西为防治小麦病害进行了浸种，长治等十五个县浸种达百分之三十至七十。各地供销社并购置信石及信石精、黑矾等药剂，供给农民毒杀蝼蛄；在棉产区结合了棉价政策，有计划的留下棉田，在灾区大力进行排水，贷发麦种，大量种麦，安定了灾民情绪。
    在秋耕方面：种麦前后华北各省都有领导的进行了秋耕。银行贷发了耕牛贷款。各级领导机关亲自检查解决问题。各地耕畜增加了，并组织了人拉犁、刨地、人畜变工、草料换工，克服了耕畜缺乏的困难，大体上完成了普耕一遍的任务。河北省普耕一遍的面积达百分之八十七点二，绥远达百分之八十三，山西老区均普耕一遍、新区达百分之七十。估计华北全区普耕在百分之八十五以上，超过了一九四八年百分之七十四的百分之十一。但各地区均存在不平衡现象，如平原省沁阳县普耕只达百分之三十八。河北唐山专区只达百分之六十三。山东达到百分之四十七。而鲁中南只达百分之十八。因此今春组织耕地，还是一个严重的任务。
    取得以上成绩的原因，主要是由于这些地区的战争业已结束，畜力人力能普遍动员，投入生产运动，群众经过多年虫害教训，已体会到秋耕的重要。加以各地领导机关均极重视，老区都抽调不少干部深入检查推动工作，如山西长治专区副专员、中共地委副书记都亲自下乡检查推动。
    其次是领导上认真帮助群众组织了人拉犁、刨地、人畜变工、草料换工、贷发了大量麦种与农业药剂，并组织技术干部下乡指导浸种等等。这些措施就保证完成了种麦与秋耕的任务。
    在冬季生产方面，各地也做出不少的成绩。如在农业生产方面：各地为了保证今年粮棉增产任务的胜利完成，曾经采取了各种有效措施。华北区的山西、河北、察哈尔及华东区的苏北、山东等地，都取得了不少成绩。首先表现在积肥方面，山西长治等四十一个县的统计，今年能较去年增施肥料一、二成（去年平均施肥量约为老区四十五担，新区三十四担），同时已开始注意了肥料的质量。各地并帮助烈军工属积肥，要求使他们的耕地达到平均施肥量。在肥源方面，城粪下乡已为各地所重视，如察省张家口、大同、宣化三市，组织了大量的垃圾粪便下乡。万全沙家庄四十五户不到一个月即自万全掏出大粪二百六十多车。北京市计划将市内粪干二千万斤，贷给郊区农民。江苏一带积极挖河泥，准备了大量的肥料。在水利方面，河北省打井五万眼，推广水车七万辆，扩大水田一百五十万亩的计划，正在积极进行。现已有一千七百十六座砖窑赶烧井砖，三百四十四个水车工厂赶制水车。各县正组织贷水车与打井工作，成安县在去年十一月下旬，即已打井五百三十眼。山西百万亩冬浇计划，到十二月底已达六十九万亩。平原济源、博爱等县已完成大小利涝河二十九道（排水河）。苏北导治沂河，山东导沭二期工程，皖北修理堤坝，江西鄱阳湖、湖南洞庭湖的溃堤及湖北江汉溃堤的修整，均已动工。在修理与补充农具上，山西省供销社以九百万斤米，经营与扶植华北著名的荫城与阳泉铁货农具业，该两地铁货农具业得到很大的发展。即以荫城附近壶关区的统计看来，大小方炉已由去年的五座增至今年的三十四座，增加几达七倍。山西省有十九个县已新增农具十万件。察省生产农具十四万件及平原省增加农具百万件的计划，均在积极进行中。各地领导上对于冬季生产与春耕准备工作的密切结合及部分地区对春耕准备工作的重视不够，还是须要注意的问题。
    在冬季副业生产与救灾方面，已有很大发展。河北、平原、山东、东北等地的熬硝，河北、平原、江苏、安徽、湖北等地的捕鱼，山西的药材、核桃、铁货、硫磺的输出，东北察绥的运粮、打猎及油料与麻皮的输出，陕北的运粮，河北、平原的土布、织席、柳编等手工业生产与土产运销等，都已逐渐开展起来。在今年的副业生产中，表现了一个崭新的特点，即国营经济用与供销社签订合同的办法，把农民的小生产组织起来，由战时自给自足的经济体系，逐渐过渡到适应国内外市场需要的、比较有组织有计划的经济体系。这种合同制已开始在东北、华北、山东等地开展起来，有力地推进了生产，同时保证了大部灾民的生活。但是由于敌人的封锁，国内购买力没有恢复，及新的城乡关系正在建立之中，因此副业生产品与土产品一般的还存在着销路停滞，及某些生产的原料缺乏等问题。如山东土产与副业品推销困难，如解决了销路问题，即能挽回小米十至十五亿斤，可解决灾民生活问题。河北灾区的苇席，土硝销路亦曾停滞。高阳一带土布虽推销不成问题，但洋纱缺乏，因而不能充分生产。同时副业生产上还存在着盲目性，如山东渤海区惠济县领导上缺乏调查研究，盲目的在产花生地区（四区）发展油坊，超过了市场需要，因而被迫停业。
    目前冬季生产及春耕准备工作的运动发展不平衡，一般在新区在非灾区，还是布置号召多，具体组织检查少，因而形成自流现象。在老区及灾区仍有个别地区领导上重视不够，忙于其他工作，放松领导现象，如平原的梁山县等地。有些地区方针不够明确，如东北只提副业，不提农业，有些地区只注意了农业，而忽视了副业，有些地区仍然存在着盲目性、不调查、不研究、不根据国家市场及群众需要，而主观的制定计划。以上各种偏向，亟应引起各地领导的注意，在工作中迅速纠正。现春节已过，应即进行春耕准备，如何能使冬季副业生产与春耕准备工作密切结合，并在春耕中还能适当的进行副业生产，也是应当引起各地领导注意研究的问题。
