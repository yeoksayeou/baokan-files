The right half will be exchanged at banks for government bonds with half the original face value. Bank deposits are also ordered to be processed in accordance with the above method. According to Reuters: Business in Indonesia was almost at a standstill on the 20th, and all markets were in a state of chaos. Some people refused to cut their banknotes in half.
