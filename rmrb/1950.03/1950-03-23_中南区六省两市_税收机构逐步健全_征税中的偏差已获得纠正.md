Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd—The tax work in the six provinces and two cities of the Central and Southern District has achieved significant results after half a year of efforts to rectify it from June to December last year.

The tax institutions in various provinces and cities in the Central and Southern District were gradually established on a very weak foundation. It was only two months after the liberation of Wuhan that the Central China Tax Bureau (now renamed the Central and Southern Tax Administration) was established to uniformly lead the tax work in the entire district. After the first Central China Tax Conference in early August last year, tax institutions at all levels were established throughout the district according to the administrative system. At present, there are six provincial tax bureaus, two directly-administered municipal tax bureaus, forty-six special district tax bureaus, two hundred and eighty-one county and city tax bureaus, and eight hundred and seventy-three tax offices (excluding tax bureaus and offices under Guangdong and Guangxi).

Due to the different times of liberation in various regions, most of the tax work cadres initially came from rural areas to the cities, and the tax system contained guerrilla warfare tactics and rural viewpoints. For example, Henan Province initially abolished all old tax laws of the Kuomintang and completely disrupted the old tax institutions. In the collection of business tax, it ignored investigation and research, and ideologically held the erroneous view of "relying on small merchants, uniting with medium merchants, and打击large merchants," thus causing uneven burdens that were excessively heavy or light, increasing the concerns of industrialists and merchants, and affecting the due fiscal revenue. After the provincial tax conference in early September last year, the leading organs vigorously corrected it. Wuhan and Jiangxi and Hunan provinces temporarily used the old tax system and made necessary modifications to ensure the completion of tax revenue tasks.

Based on the preliminary discussion at the first Central China Tax Conference in early August last year and with reference to the experience of trial implementation in various places, the former Central Plains Provisional People's Government successively promulgated the Interim Measures for the Collection of Central China Goods Tax, Temporary Commercial Tax, Stamp Tax, Real Estate Tax, Entertainment Tax, and Feast Tax, and their implementation details on September 21 and October 20 last year. Thus, the tax system of the Central and Southern District was initially unified. After the promulgation of all the above tax laws, the implementation in various places was generally good. However, some deviations also occurred in the collection of temporary commercial tax and goods tax. For example, in some places in Henan Province, there was unequal burden, with fixed merchants paying taxes while itinerant merchants did not, and serious tax evasion. In Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, temporary commercial taxes were pre-collected from purchasing merchants or intercepted from transportation and sales merchants. The evaluation of cigarettes in Xuchang and Kaifeng, Henan, was not properly controlled, which once caused considerable losses to both fiscal revenue and factory production. These deviations have been corrected after several circulars issued by the former Central China Tax Bureau and by sending personnel to various places to provide assistance.

After the establishment of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, the Central China Tax Bureau was renamed the Central and Southern Tax Administration, and tax laws and tax regulations were implemented in accordance with those promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government. There are currently more than 20,000 tax cadres in the district, but the overall quality is relatively poor. Therefore, how to enrich the number of cadres and improve the quality of cadres is still a problem that urgently needs to be solved.

The experience of tax work in the Central and Southern District proves that to do a good job in tax work, it is necessary to: 1. Obtain the attention and supervision of leading organs at all levels. For example, serious tax evasion was discovered in Henan Province before September last year. After the provincial government checked the cadres' view of neglecting taxation and corrected the deviation, tax revenue gradually increased month by month. 2. Tax authorities at all levels must strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting to higher levels, strictly implement the tax revenue plan, and overcome all tendencies of anarchism and indiscipline. 3. Tax work cadres must strengthen political and business learning, regularly investigate and study the business and burden situation of urban industrialists and merchants, correct the so-called "benevolent government" viewpoint, and closely connect with the masses.

### 中南区六省两市  税收机构逐步健全  征税中的偏差已获得纠正

　　中南区六省两市
    税收机构逐步健全
    征税中的偏差已获得纠正
    【新华社汉口二十二日电】中南区六省两市的税收工作，经过去年六月至十二月半年间的努力整顿，已获得显著成绩。
    中南区各省市的税收机构，是在极薄弱的基础上逐渐建立起来的。武汉解放两个月后，才成立了华中税务总局（现已改称为中南税务管理局），以统一领导全区税务工作。去年八月初首届华中税务会议后，全区按行政系统先后建立了各级税务机构。现在计有六个省税务局，两个直辖市税务局，四十六个专区分税务局，二八一个县市税务局，八七三个税务所（两广下属税务局、所未计在内）。
    由于各地区解放时间先后不一，税收工作干部大部分系由农村初入城市，税收制度中存在着游击主义的作风和农村观点。如河南省一开始就废除了国民党一切旧税法，全部打乱了旧税收机构，且在征收营业税方面忽视了调查研究，思想上存在着“依靠小商，团结中商，打击大商”的错误观点，因而造成畸重畸轻、负担不公的现象，增加了工商业者的顾虑，也影响了应有的财政收入。去年九月初该省税务会议后，领导机关才大力予以纠正。武汉市和江西、湖南两省则暂时沿用旧税制并予以必要的修改，确保了税收任务的完成。
    根据去年八月初首届华中税务会议初步讨论的结果，并参照各地试行的经验，前中原临时人民政府于去年九月二十一日及十月二十日先后颁布了华中货物税、临时商业税、印花税、房地产税、娱乐税、筵席税等各项征收暂行办法及其施行细则，至此中南区税收制度乃初告统一。所有上项税法颁布后，各地执行情况大体良好。但征收在临时商业税及货物税方面也曾发生一些偏差，如河南省有些地方曾发生座商收税而行商不收税的负担不公和严重漏税的现象。湖南、湖北、江西等地或预征采购商，或拦征运销商的临时商业税。河南许昌、开封卷烟评价未予适当掌握，曾一度使财政收入及厂商生产都受相当损失。这些偏向经前华中税务总局几度通令和派员分赴各地帮助后都已得到纠正。
    中南军政委员会成立后，华中税务总局已改称中南税务管理局，税法、税则均根据中央人民政府政务院颁布者执行。全区税收干部目前有两万多人，但一般质量都较差。因此，如何充实干部数量、提高干部质量仍是目前亟须努力解决的问题。
    中南区税收工作的经验证明：要搞好税收工作，必须做到：一、取得各级领导机关的重视与监督，如去年九月前河南省曾发现严重的漏税现象，经省府检查了干部的轻视税收的观点，纠正偏向后，税收就逐月递增。二、各级税务机关对上级必须严格执行请示报告制度，严格执行税收计划，克服一切无政府、无纪律的倾向。三、税收工作干部，必须加强政治与业务学习，经常调查研究城市工商者经营和负担情况，纠正所谓“仁政”观点，并密切联系群众。
