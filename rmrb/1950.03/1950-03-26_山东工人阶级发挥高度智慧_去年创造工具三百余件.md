Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 24th. The working class in Shandong's state-owned enterprises has demonstrated great creativity, making significant contributions to the production front. According to statistics from some state-owned enterprises in Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Boshan and other cities, over 350 kinds of materials and tools were created and imitated in 1949 alone. Among them, the successful imitation of a 40-turn indexing plate for manufacturing equal gears by the Fourth Factory of the Jinan Mechanical Industry Bureau solved the equipment difficulties of the factory and the needs of various enterprises under the Shandong Heavy Industry Department. The successful manufacturing of carbon rods by the Electrical Materials Factory of the Boshan Xihe Coal Mine partially solved the source of calcium carbide required in the coal mine. After a year of exploration, workers and staff of the sulfuric acid plant of the Jiaodong Longling Mining Company realized the replacement of the original manual ore roasting furnace with a mechanical ore roasting furnace, which increased the efficiency of ore roasting by 36% and reduced the risk of poisoning for workers. Liu Qingxiang, the leader of the fitter group of the Second Factory of the Jinan Mechanical Industry Bureau, successfully manufactured a lapping machine for plates (tools for measuring templates), which solved the factory's shortage of plates. Wang Linghai, a special-class model worker of the Xuzhou Locomotive Depot of the Jinpu Railway, has completed four creative and important improvements to materials and tools since April last year. Wang Linghai was also elected as a representative of the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference because of these achievements.

The workers are selfless in completing their creative work. Liu Qingxiang, who created the plate lapping machine, collapsed and fell ill in bed, but he still held the drawings in his hand; unable to stand steadily, he still insisted on installing the nearly completed machine himself. The workers of the sulfuric acid plant of Jiaodong Longling Mining Company suffered three failures in creating the mechanical ore roasting furnace, but the workers' working enthusiasm remained unabated, and the last time they completed the furnace repair work ten days ahead of the original schedule. In order to consolidate and universally promote the creativity of workers, major enterprises in Shandong are now preparing to launch a rationalization proposal campaign in a planned manner and provide rewards.

　　山东工人阶级发挥高度智慧
    去年创造工具三百余件
    【新华社济南二十四日电】山东公营企业工人发挥创造性，在生产战线上贡献很大。据济南、青岛、徐州、博山等市部分公营企业的统计，在一九四九年中创造和仿造的物料和工具即达三百五十多种。其中济南机械工业局第四厂仿造的制造等量牙轮的四○转分度盘获得成功，解决了该厂设备上的困难和山东重工业部所属各企业的需要。博山西河煤矿电料厂制造炭精棒获得成功，部分地解决了煤矿中所需的电石来源。胶东珑玲矿业公司硫酸厂工人和职员，经一年的摸索，实现了以机械焚矿炉代替原来的人工焚矿炉，使焚矿的效率提高百分之三十六，并减除了工人中毒的危害。济南机械工业局第二厂钳工组组长刘庆祥制造对板（测量样板的工具）的对板精磨机成功，解决了该厂对板缺乏的困难。津浦铁路徐州机务段工人特等功臣王岭海，自去年四月以来，已经完成对于物料和工具的四次富有创造性的重要改进。王岭海并因这些功迹被选为山东省人民代表会议的代表。
    工人们为完成自己的创造工作是奋不顾身的。创造对板精磨机的刘庆祥累倒病在床上，手里仍拿着图样；站立不稳，仍坚持要自己去按装即将完成的机器。胶东珑玲矿业公司硫酸厂工人在创建机械焚矿炉时，曾遭受三次失败，但工人的工作情绪始终不懈，最后一次较原规定提前十天完成了修炉工作。为巩固并普遍发挥工人的创造性，现山东各大企业正准备有步骤地展开合理化建议运动，并进行奖励。
