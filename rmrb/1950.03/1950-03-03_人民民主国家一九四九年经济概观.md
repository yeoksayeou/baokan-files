Economic Overview of People's Democratic Countries in 1949
Translated by Qiu He

The People's Democratic countries have now summarized their general economic work in 1949, and the results of this work demonstrate new and significant successes in the economic life of these countries.

In Poland, 1949 marked the completion of the first three-year economic plan. The country's working class gloriously fulfilled their duties, completing the plan two months ahead of schedule on November 1st. In November and December, Poland's industry performed even better. The most important industrial sectors—coal, iron and steel, electricity, construction, chemicals, and cotton textiles—completed their 1949 plans ahead of the scheduled period. As a result, the total value of industrial products in 1949 exceeded the level of the last few years before the war by 75 percent. Today, Poland's industrial production per capita has increased two and a half times compared to pre-war levels, while agricultural production has increased by 12 percent. During the three-year plan period, workers' real wages also doubled, increasing by 27 percent compared to pre-war levels.

Between 1946 and 1949, the ranks of the Polish working class increased by 1.1 million, or 40 percent. Industrialization is the main goal of the new six-year economic plan that the Polish people began implementing on January 1st of this year. They call this six-year plan Poland's transformation into socialism. The completion of this plan will make industrial production per capita about five times the pre-war level. The people's living standards will be raised to twice the pre-war level.

The working people of Hungary completed their three-year national economic plan in two years and five months. In many industrial sectors, such as coal mining, metallurgy, chemicals, and rubber industries, their plans were completed as early as mid-December. In the process of successfully implementing the three-year plan, Hungarian factories began to produce items from new production sectors, such as heavy machine tools, seagoing ships, Dzerzhinsky tractors, tractor plows, and cameras.

At the end of December, the Council of Ministers passed a resolution proposed by the Hungarian Workers' Party on the further nationalization of industry and transportation. Factories employing more than ten workers, as well as enterprises belonging to foreign capital, were nationalized. Experience has shown that these enterprises belonging to foreign capitalists often serve as cover for foreign spies and saboteurs. The new five-year plan will transform Hungary, currently dominated by agriculture, into a country dominated by industry; and the nationalization of these enterprises belonging to foreign capital will be an important factor in promoting the completion of the five-year plan.

The working people of Czechoslovakia completed the 1949 plan—the plan for the first year of the five-year plan—month by month. As early as December 8th, news of the completion of the 1949 plan by various industrial sectors was reported in the newspapers. Prime Minister Zápotocký announced on December 4th that the working people of the Czechoslovak Republic, as a whole, had already realized the plan for the first year of the five-year plan. On January 1, 1950, 102 percent of the plan had been completed.

Czechoslovakia's recently announced 1950 national economic plan calls for greatly raising the level of all economic sectors. For example, the amount of work in the construction industry is stipulated to increase by 41 percent compared to the 1949 figure. State-owned farms and machine and tractor stations will also proceed according to plan.

In Romania, the second anniversary of the founding of the Republic was celebrated on December 30th, coinciding with the completion of the 1949 national economic plan.

The National Assembly has already adopted the 1950 national economic plan, which will lay the foundation for the first five-year plan. The total value of Romania's industrial production is stipulated to increase by 37 percent this year compared to 1949. Along with the massive increase in industrial output, the production of several foods will increase by more than 60 to 70 percent. The area planted with rice, cotton, and flax will increase by 35 to 50 percent compared to last year. In 1950 alone, the people's living standards are stipulated to increase by 15 percent.

On January 11th, the working people of Albania celebrated the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Republic with jubilation, summarizing the completion of the 1949 plan and the economic development achievements of the past four years. Last year's industrial output reached 431 percent of the 1938 level. The planting of crops has exceeded 165 percent of the pre-war level, while livestock breeding has exceeded 190 percent. There have also been great achievements in the development of public education, health, culture, and art. Before the war, the number of students was only 58,000, which increased to 181,000 in 1949. The country's first institution of higher education—the Educational Institute—has already opened.

Bulgaria and Korea have also achieved great success in production. The People's Republic of China has made great progress in restoring the economy destroyed by the war. In all People's Democratic countries, foreign trade is increasing, and finances are becoming increasingly consolidated.

The working people of the People's Democratic countries are proud of their economic achievements and overjoyed at the improvement of their living standards. They begin another year of labor with confidence. The working people in capitalist countries are threatened by unemployment, wage cuts, high living costs, or other living difficulties; while the working people of the People's Democratic countries do not have these threats. Close economic cooperation with the powerful socialist country—the Soviet Union—as well as close economic cooperation between the People's Democratic countries, economic development strictly in accordance with plans, and the heroic labor efforts of workers and peasants, guarantee further development and achievements in the construction of socialism in the People's Democratic countries.

　　人民民主国家一九四九年经济概观
    秋禾译
    人民民主国家现在业已总结了她们在一九四九年的一般经济工作，这些工作的结果证明了这些国家在经济生活上新的和巨大的成功。
    在波兰，一九四九年标志第一个三年经济计划的完成。该国的工人阶级光荣地克尽了他们自己的职责，在十一月一日，提前两个月完成了计划。在十一月和十二月间，波兰共和国的工业，有更良好的表现。最主要的工业部门——煤、铁和钢、电力、建筑、化学与棉织业——在预定的时期前完成了它们一九四九年的计划。因之，一九四九年工业生产品的总值，超过了战前最后几年的水平的百分之七十五。今日波兰每一人口的工业生产额已较战前增高了两倍半，而农业生产额则增加了百分之十二。在三年计划时期中，工人的实际工资也加倍了，它较战前的水平增加了百分之二十七。
    在一九四六年和一九四九年间，波兰工人阶级的队伍，增加了一百一十万或百分之四十。工业化是今年一月一日波兰人民开始实施的新的六年经济计划的主要目标。他们称这个六年计划为波兰的转变为社会主义的计划。此计划的完成将使每一人口的工业生产额约为战前的水平的五倍。人民的生活程度将提高为战前之两倍。
    匈牙利的劳动人民，在两年另五个月的时间内，完成了他们的三年国民经济计划。在许多工业部门中，如煤矿、冶金、化学及橡胶工业，早在十二月中旬，就完成了它们的计划。在三年计划顺利实现的进程中，匈牙利的工厂开始制出新的生产部门的物品，如重机器制造工具、航海用的船舶、第则尔拖拉机、拖拉犁地机和照相机等。
    十二月底，部长会议通过了由匈牙利工人党提出的关于工业和运输业更进一步国有化的决议。雇佣十个工人以上的工厂，以及属于外国资本的企业，都收归国有。经验证明这些属于外国资本家的企业，常为外国间谍和破坏者的掩护。新的五年计划，将把目前农业占优势的匈牙利，转变为工业占优势的国家；而这些属于外国资本的企业之收归国有，将是促进五年计划完成的一个重要因素。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民，逐月地完成了一九四九年的计划，——五年计划的头一年的计划。早在十二月八日，各工业部门的完成其一九四九年的计划的消息，即已见诸报端。萨波托斯基总理于十二月四日宣布：捷克斯洛伐克共和国的劳动人民，就整个来说，业已实现五年计划之第一年的计划。在一九五○年一月一日的时候，已完成了计划的百分之一○二。
    捷克斯洛伐克最近公布的一九五○年国民经济计划，号召在一切经济部门都大大地提高其水平。例如，建筑工业的工作数量规定要较一九四九年的数字增加百分之四十一。国营农场以及机器和拖拉机站，也将按照计划进行。
    在罗马尼亚，十二月三十日庆祝共和国成立的二周年纪念，恰逢一九四九年国家经济计划的完成。
    国民大会业已通过了一九五○年的国家经济计划，该计划将为第一个五年计划打下基础。罗马尼亚的工业生产总额，规定今年要较一九四九年增加百分之三十七。与工业品产额的巨大增加同时，若干食物将增加百分之六十至百分之七十以上。种植米、棉和亚麻的面积，将较去年增加百分之三十五至百分之五十。仅在一九五○年中，人民的生活水准规定要提高百分之十五。
    阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，一月十一日狂欢地庆祝共和国成立四周年纪念之际，总结了一九四九年计划的完成以及过去四年来经济发展上的成就。去年的工业产量计达一九三八年之水平的百分之四百三十一。农作物的种植已超出战前水平的百分之一百六十五，而牲畜饲养则超出百分之一九○。在公共教育、卫生、文化、艺术等的发展上，同样也有巨大的成就。在战前，学生数目仅有五万八千，在一九四九年已增为十八万一千。该国的第一所高等教育机关——教育学院——已经开学了。
    保加利亚和朝鲜，在生产上，也获得很大的成就。中华人民共和国在恢复战争所破坏了的经济上，也有大的进步。在一切人民民主国家中，对外贸易在增加着，而财政也日趋巩固。
    人民民主国家的劳动人民，正以他们的经济成就而自豪，对他们生活程度之改进则兴高采烈。他们满怀信心地开始另一年的劳动。资本主义国家内的劳动人民受失业、工资削减、生活费高涨、或其他生活困难所威胁；而人民民主国家的劳动人民却没有这些威胁。与强大的社会主义国家——苏联——的亲密经济合作以及各人民民主国家彼此间的紧密经济合作，严格遵照计划进行的经济发展，以及工人和农民的英勇的劳动努力，保证人民民主国家在社会主义的建设中将有更进一步的发展和成就。（译自《新时代》一九五○年第三期）
