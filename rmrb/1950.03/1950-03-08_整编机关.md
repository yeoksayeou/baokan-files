　　Streamlining Government Agencies
    The experience of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government in streamlining its agencies provides useful reference for all units of our Central People's Government, as well as for the newly organized military and political committees of the major administrative regions and their subordinate departments, when organizing their agencies. The experience of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee in streamlining points out:
    First, all our government agencies are agencies that practically serve the people. Although a brilliant vision of the new China's construction is unfolding before us, and in the future there must be a precise division of labor in government agencies, and each department must have a large number of government workers, from the current situation of the state's financial resources, human resources, and the actual situation of the existing work, it is not immediately necessary nor is it possible to establish a perfectly complete government organization, nor is it possible to immediately adopt a very detailed division of labor. We must distinguish the importance and urgency of the business, and set up institutions and allocate cadres with emphasis. The internal levels of the agency should not be too many, and appropriate attention should be paid to the flexible use of cadres to adjust the difficulty of lack of backbone. Also, attention must be paid to overcoming the abnormal phenomenon of uneven busyness and leisure of some cadres. This is also a way to prevent the spread of bureaucratic work style in the agency.
    Secondly, the method of organizing agencies should be to equip as many staff members in the business areas of the agency as possible, and reduce staff members in the administrative affairs area. The staffing of administrative affairs personnel in some agencies is still too large and must be reduced as much as possible. As long as we pay attention to simplifying procedures, implement reasonable organization in work and life (such as running cooperative canteens, implementing a public service system for offices, etc.), we can greatly reduce the staffing of administrative personnel.
    Thirdly, streamlining government agencies should be combined with rectifying the work style of government agencies and rectifying the learning system of government agencies. That is, we must pay attention to the training and improvement of cadres in a planned way, and methods such as "taking apprentices", going to the countryside to help with land reform for a period of time, and agency spare-time schools can all be adopted.
    Streamlining government agencies cannot be regarded as routine business, and its political significance must be recognized, that is, we must fight to reduce national financial expenditures, strengthen the efficiency of agency work, and more effectively train cadres.

### 整编机关

　　整编机关
    中央人民政府政法委员会整编机关的经验，对于我们中央人民政府各单位、及各大行政区新组织的军政委员会及其所属各部门，在组织机关时，是有用的参考。政法委员会整编的经验指出：
    第一，我们一切政府机关，是为人民实际办事的机关。在我们前面，虽然已展开着新中国辉煌建设的远景，将来在政府机关中必须有精细的分工，各部门均须要有大量的政府工作人员。但从目前国家财力、人力以及现有工作实际情况来说，并不立刻需要而且也不可能建立起十分完备的政府机构，也不可能立刻采取十分细密的分工。必须分别业务的轻重缓急，有重点地设置机构和编配干部。机关内部层次不宜太多，并要适当地注意干部的机动使用，以调剂骨干缺乏的困难。且须注意克服部分干部忙闲不均的畸形现象。这也是防止机关官僚主义作风蔓延的一个办法。
    其次，组织机关的方法，要尽量多配备各该机关业务方面的工作人员，减少行政事务方面的工作人员。现在有些机关的行政事务人员的编制还是过大，必须力求缩减。只要注意简化办事手续，实行工作上与生活上的合理组织（如办合作食堂，实行办公室公共服务员制等），完全可以大大减少事务人员编制的。
    第三，整编机关应与整顿机关工作作风和整顿机关学习制度相结合。即必须有计划地注意干部的培养与提高，采取“带徒弟”的方式、下乡帮助土地改革一个时期的方式，以及机关业余学校等方式都是可以采用的。
    整编机关，不能看作是例行公事，必须认识它的政治意义，即必须为减少国家财政开支，加强机关工作效率，与更有效地培养干部而斗争。
