　　Reading Three Novellas Including "New Things Done in a New Way"
    Mao Dun

    After happily and carefully reading "New Things Done in a New Way," "Thirty Work Points," and "The In-Laws," I would like to write down my thoughts.

    Among these three novellas, I like "New Things Done in a New Way" the most. All three novellas share common advantages: in terms of content, they express the changes in the thinking of farmers in old liberated areas through ordinary daily life, and depict the prosperity and joy of rural life after land reform. In terms of form, they are all tightly structured, vividly portray characters, and use refined language. However, among these three, "New Things Done in a New Way" must be considered the best, both in terms of content and form. My reasons for making such an assessment are as follows:

    First, the theme of "New Things Done in a New Way" is production and thrift, which is expressed through the old custom of having dowries when marrying off daughters and taking in daughters-in-law. The author selected this typical subject matter from rural daily life, which shows his keen sense and ability to focus on things that people don't pay much attention to. Because of this, we have a sense of freshness when reading this work. The author's other short story, "Thirty Work Points," also writes about production, but it is not as light and natural as "New Things Done in a New Way."

    Second, "New Things Done in a New Way" can be said to be flawless in terms of technique from beginning to end. This is a short story with a very high level of technical skill. Some short stories nowadays are essentially shortened novellas, a condensed account of life's events rather than a cross-section of life. "New Things Done in a New Way" is a perfectly handled cross-section of life, from which we can clearly see "the old is disappearing, and the new is growing." Of course, "Thirty Work Points" and "The In-Laws" also depict cross-sections of life, but even though they are both writing about cross-sections of life, it must be said that "New Things Done in a New Way" is much more skillful in terms of technique. Let's compare the opening two paragraphs of "Thirty Work Points" and "New Things Done in a New Way":

    The first two paragraphs of "Thirty Work Points" use nearly three hundred words to describe the situation. In a short story of about three thousand words, it is not very economical to spend three hundred words at the beginning on a rather dry description of the situation. The third paragraph, "At the party branch meeting, branch secretary Gao Laosuo called on party members to play a guaranteeing role and arranged for Da Guo to lead Er Ni to sow seeds." This can be regarded as introducing the protagonist of the story to the reader, but the theme is still not clearly pointed out. We must read the entire fourth paragraph before we can taste something of its meaning.

    "New Things Done in a New Way" is different. Its opening sentence, "Two days before Wang Guide was transferred to work in the district, the elders on both sides, seeing through their children's minds, were willing to hold the wedding," is very powerful. This sentence brings up the whole story. Moreover, it starts by saying that the elders on both sides were willing to hold the wedding, but then a conflict arises, and the article has its ups and downs. Following this opening sentence is a retrospective narration of more than two hundred words, giving an account of the couple who are about to get married. These two hundred words are full of imagery with narration and commentary. "The young couple often work together before they get married, which is really a new thing!"—This sentence in the mouths of the old women not only clarifies the affection of the "young couple," but also brings out the words "new thing," but the "new thing" here is not yet related to the topic; this is a foil first.

    Comparing the opening two paragraphs of these two novellas, it can be seen that the latter's ability to attract people lies in avoiding plain narration and in having editing.

    Third, if we compare these two novellas as a whole, I also think that "New Things Done in a New Way" is superior to "Thirty Work Points."

    First, let's talk about "New Things Done in a New Way." The whole novella has three chapters. The first chapter unfolds the story, the second chapter reaches the climax of the story, and the third chapter ends the story—the problem is solved. The outlines of these three chapters are extremely clear, but the writing is not rigid at all. The first chapter unfolds the story, first writing about Fenglan's and her father's different opinions (regarding dowry), and concluding with Fenglan persuading her father. The text turns from Fenglan's unwillingness to have a dowry to her father's wanting to sell the calf to buy a dowry, and finally culminates in Fenglan wanting the calf to be her dowry. The writing is tortuous and rhythmic, while also drawing out the faces of the father and daughter. However, the second chapter starts with a new head, directly writing about Wang Guide and his mother. The words in this chapter are extremely economical and very layered. First, write about Wang's mother getting angry, creating a twist, and then pointing out the topic. After a considerable amount of maneuvering, it concludes with Wang's mother reluctantly being persuaded. Here, Wang's mother's reluctant persuasion echoes Fenglan's father's being persuaded (also somewhat reluctantly) at the end of the first chapter, but the writing style is different. Finally, in the third chapter, the problem is solved. In addition to writing about the atmosphere of the wedding venue, Wang's mother is still the focus of the description in the whole chapter. The image of this character is written very clearly and three-dimensionally.

    Now let's look at "Thirty Work Points." This novella is divided into four chapters. The author certainly divided the unfolding of the story into layers, but whether looking at the whole story or each chapter, it always feels that the arrangement of the details is not very appropriate. It's as if some materials should have been discarded but weren't, and some that should have been developed weren't. A lot of space is used to write about Er Ni (the protagonist), but Er Ni's image is not very clear.

    Fourth, if we must find a weakness in "New Things Done in a New Way," then I think the general atmosphere of the wedding venue at the beginning of the third chapter is written a little worse. In general, when writing this kind of lively scene, it is necessary to write it in a complex and orderly manner, with both a bird's-eye view of the whole scene and "close-ups" of individual corners and characters. The author has achieved orderliness, but it is not complex enough. There are individual "close-ups," but we are not shown the whole picture. It is not very difficult to achieve a relatively perfect level of writing lively scenes. As long as the author has a wide-ranging vision and makes some arrangements before writing, it will be done. And judging from the talent shown by the author of "New Things Done in a New Way" in this novella, he can do it.

    The above is my opinion on "New Things Done in a New Way." These remarks, which are entirely from a technical point of view, are dispensable in the first place. However, the other side of the issue is that since we want to grasp the techniques, we might as well talk about the techniques occasionally. Therefore, I still wrote it out. As for pursuing techniques to the point of getting into a dead end, that is a bias and not worth emulating. I hope this short article does not have any bad side effects.

### 读《新事新办》等三篇小说

　　读《新事新办》等三篇小说
    茅盾
    十分高兴而且仔细地读过了《新事新办》、《三十张工票》和《亲家婆儿》以后，我愿意写下我的读后感。
    这三篇小说中间，我最喜欢的，就是《新事新办》。三篇小说有它们共同的优点，在内容方面，是从平凡的日常生活中表现了老解放区农民思想的变化，表现了土改后的农村生活的兴旺和愉快，在形式方面，都能做到结构紧凑，形象生动，文字洗炼。然而这三篇中间，无论从内容或从形式看，又不能不推《新事新办》为最佳。我所以作这样的估价，理由如下：
    一、《新事新办》的主题是生产节约，是通过了嫁女娶媳得有陪送这一个旧习惯来表现了这主题的；作者从农村的日常生活中选取了这一典型性的题材，足见他的感觉锐敏，能从人家不大注意的地方着眼，也就因为了这一点，我们读这作品时有清新之感。作者的另一短篇《三十张工票》也写了生产，可就不及《新事新办》写的那样轻灵而自然。
    二、《新事新办》在技巧上可说是从头至尾无懈可击。这是一篇技术水准很高的短篇小说。现在有些短篇小说严格说来实在是缩紧了的中篇，是一篇生活的流水账的节略而不是生活的横断面。《新事新办》却是处理得很完美的一幅生活横断面，从这横断面中，清楚地给我们看到“旧的正在消逝，新的正在成长。”自然，《三十张工票》和《亲家婆儿》写的也是生活横断面，但同样是写生活横断面，却不能不说《新事新办》在技巧上是高明得多了。试以《三十张工票》和《新事新办》的开头两段作一比较：
    《三十张工票》开头第一二两段用了将近三百字叙述情况。在三千字左右的短篇中，开头就花费了三百字的相当干燥的情况叙述，这是不大经济的。第三段“党支部会上，支部书记高老锁号召党员起保证作用，并布置叫大国带领二妮点种”。这算是把小说的主人公引见给读者了，可是主题仍然点得不够明晰。我们一定要读完第四段，这才辨出点味儿来。
    《新事新办》可就不同了。它开篇的那一句，“王贵德头打调到区里工作的前两天，两边的老人看透了闺女儿子的心思，就愿意把喜事办了。”就很有力。这一句就带起了全篇。而且先说两边老人就愿意把喜事办了，下文却闹了蹩扭，文章这才有波澜。接着这开篇的一句的，是二百多字的回叙，把快要结婚的一对来个交代，这二百多字夹叙夹议，多么富于形象。“没过门的小俩口常在一块作活，真是个新事儿！”——老大娘们嘴里这一句既点明了“小俩口”之情投意合，又带出“新事儿”三字，但是这里的“新事儿”还不是扣着题目的，这是先来一个陪衬。
    比较了这两篇小说的开头两段，就看得出后者之所以能引人入胜就在于避免平铺直叙，在于有剪裁。
    三、再把这两篇小说整个作一比较，我也以为《新事新办》胜过了《三十张工票》。
    先说《新事新办》。全篇共三章，第一章展开故事，第二章故事到达顶点，第三章，故事结束——问题得到解决。这三章眉目极为清楚，可是写来一点不呆板。第一章展开故事，先写凤兰和她父亲的意见（关于陪送）不同，而以凤兰说服了父亲作结。从凤兰之不要陪送，转到父亲想卖掉小牛买陪嫁，终于归结到凤兰要小牛代嫁妆，行文曲折而有致，同时又把父女两人的面貌画了出来。可是第二章却另提头，直写王贵德和他的母亲了。这一章的文字极经济，又极有层次。先写王母生气，故作曲笔，然后点出本题。又经过了相当的腾挪，然后以王母之勉强被说服了作结。在这里，王母之勉强被说服与第一章末了凤兰父亲之被说服（也有几分勉强）遥遥相对，但笔法是两样的。最后，第三章，问题解决，全章除写结婚会场的气氛而外，王母仍是描写的焦点。这一个人物的形象写得非常清晰而且是立体的。
    现在再看《三十张工票》。这篇小说共分四章，作者对于故事的展开当然也分了层次，可是，无论就全篇看，或就各章看，总觉得细节目的安排不很妥贴，好象一堆素材该舍弃的没有都舍弃，该发挥的没有都发挥；用不少笔墨写二妮（主人公），但二妮的形象并不怎样鲜明。
    四、如果一定要在《新事新办》身上找弱点，那么，我以为第三章开头结婚会场的一般气氛是写得差一点的。大凡写这种热闹场面，既要写得错综，又要条理分明，既要有全场的鸟瞰图，又要有个别角落及人物的“特写”；作者做到了条理分明，却不够错综，有了个别的“特写”，却没有给我们看到整个画面。写热闹场面要做到比较完善的地步，并不顶难。只要作者在下笔以前，眼光四射，先有一番布置就得了；而从《新事新办》的作者在这篇小说内所表现的才能看来，他是可以做到的。
    以上就是我对于《新事新办》的一点意见。这些全从技巧方面来研究的话，本来是可有可无的，不过，问题的另一面是，既要把握技巧，也就不妨偶尔谈谈技巧，因此我还是写了出来。至于追求技巧，乃至钻进牛角尖，则是偏向，不足为训；我希望这篇短文不至于发生不好的副作用。
