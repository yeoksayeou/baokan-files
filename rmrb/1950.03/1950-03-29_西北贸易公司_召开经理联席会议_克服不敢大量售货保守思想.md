　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 27th—The joint meeting of managers of the Northwest Trading Company, lasting eleven days, concluded on the 21st. The meeting adopted the Northwest Trade Work Business Plan for 1950, as well as five proposals regarding financial systems, organizational structure, commercial administration, and the training and allocation of cadres. The meeting criticized the erroneous views of some cadres who believed that "cash in the treasury reduces the company's funds, which will affect business" and the conservative thinking of disregarding the overall situation and not daring to sell large quantities of materials. The meeting repeatedly discussed issues related to enterprise-based management, such as economic accounting, scientific management, setting staffing quotas, and using limited resources to maximize their effectiveness. It determined that trade companies at all levels should unconditionally promote an overall perspective and implement trade policies during enterprise-based management, to prevent any possible purely profit-driven viewpoints. In order to rapidly specialize the trade sector, the meeting decided to immediately begin reorganizing or merging some local trade institutions, and to establish various specialized companies in major cities in the Northwest in a focused and systematic manner.

　　西北贸易公司
    召开经理联席会议
    克服不敢大量售货保守思想
    【新华社西安二十七日电】西北区贸易公司经理联席会议，历时十一天，已于二十一日结束。会议通过了一九五○年西北贸易工作业务计划，以及关于财政制度、组织机构、商业行政管理、干部的培养与配备等五个方案。会议批判了某些干部认为“现金入库，公司资金减少，会影响业务”的错误观点和不顾全局、不敢大量抛售物资的保守思想。会议反复讨论了经济核算、科学管理、定员定额以及使用少数资力发挥最大作用等有关企业化经营的问题，并确定各级贸易公司在企业化经营中，应无条件地发扬整体观念，执行贸易政策，以防止可能发生的单纯利润观点。为使贸易部门迅速专业化，会议决定即着手改组或合并部分地方的贸易机构，有重点有步骤地在西北各大城市分别建立各种专业公司。
