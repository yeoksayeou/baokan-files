From a Novel, a Look at a Tendency in Literary Creation

To the Editors:

　　I have a few comments after reading Comrade Fang Ji’s short story "Let Life Become Better" in the fifth issue of the recently published People's Literature, Volume 1.

　　The story goes as follows: In an old liberated area, there is a young and beautiful peasant girl from a poor peasant family who has a good voice and can perform in operas. Her name is Xiaohuan, nicknamed "One Blossom." She likes to play with the boys in the village, and almost all the young men are attracted to her. Cadres and older people have opinions about her. When the village establishes a poor peasant league and elects committee members, the boys elect her, but an "old man" satirizes this, and it is not approved. She is stimulated by this and becomes restrained, no longer interacting with the boys. But without her in the poor peasant league, the young people "can't get excited." When it comes time to mobilize for military service, even though the Party branch uses various methods to mobilize, no young people, including some Party members, sign up. A village cadre realizes that the problem "lies with Xiaohuan," and talks to her. "Soon, the conscription movement in the village is launched vigorously." A man named "Daqun" is the first to sign up. "In just two days... the task was exceeded at once."

　　At the send-off rally for those joining the army, Xiaohuan boldly declares that she only has love for Daqun, and refutes people's slander of her, saying, "I am poor and have a hard life, but does my heart have to be bitter too?" "I like to play, have fun, and make noise, but it's just because I feel stifled and want to live life happily." With that, she "giggles," and "her laughter, like silver bells, ripples in the spring sunshine, so that everyone in the audience can't help but laugh with her. Especially the young men and women, as if Xiaohuan had spoken their minds for them, laugh particularly loudly..."

　　I seriously doubt: Why does the author of this work incorrectly exaggerate the power of a so-called young and beautiful girl in people's social and political life to such an extent? Taking the conscription movement as an example, is the political consciousness of our emancipated peasants to voluntarily join the army less than the effect of a pretty girl? Is the educational and political organizational leadership that our Party has long conducted among the peasants in the countryside also less effective than what a pretty girl can achieve? Is the author's description in line with the facts? I think the idea of this work is wrong and should be criticized and corrected.

With best regards!

Comrade Hao Tong:

　　"Let Life Become Better" is a bad work. Your suspicion and criticism of this work are entirely appropriate.

　　Regarding this work, even from the title, we can know that the author is expressing this theme: "The distribution of land and the elimination of feudal exploitation" has occurred, but feudal ideas and customs still bind the younger generation, preventing them from living a better life. These shackles should be eliminated, and in fact, they "will be slowly eliminated; but these will be a bit slower."

　　However, it should be said that the author's attempt to express this theme has failed. In fact, he wrote about something else. His novel exaggerates the role of a girl in the conscription movement to such an extent that it completely negates the political significance of peasants joining the People's Liberation Army! The Party's political and organizational mobilization force is far less than the power of a pretty girl!

　　Undoubtedly, this is a distorted depiction of people's political life and the social role of women by a lover-supremacist or a Freudian.

　　Unfortunately, this distortion is actually a rather common tendency in our country's current literary creation. Comrade Fang Ji's work is not the most prominent representative of this tendency. It is just one example of many works with this tendency. We can also cite many novels, ballads, dramas, and movies that use similar or even more serious erroneous views to interpret life. In these works, women seem to be merely "lovable people," merely lovers or objects of love or objects of sexual desire, and from this arises all kinds of tragicomedies. This incorrect attitude and "interest" of certain literary authors towards women's lives can also explain why there is a certain degree of popularity for works about prostitutes. Of course, many women were indeed treated by the exploiting classes merely as objects of love or sexual desire. But, first, this era has changed. Women are gaining a completely new status, and a completely new attitude towards women and towards the entire social life is taking the leading position. The observation, expression, and propaganda efforts of new writers should be used in this aspect, should be used to promote new viewpoints and criticize old viewpoints. Second, even when describing the era when certain women were merely treated as objects of love or sexual desire by certain exploiters, the task of the writers was not to focus on observing, expressing, and promoting this aspect of this era, because this was not its truly important aspect, and even women's lives at that time had more important aspects.

　　Taking this opportunity, we hope that the literary writers of New China, especially the Communist Party writers, will treat women with a new and correct attitude, treat social life, including women, and use it to educate the people. It is now time to do such work!

With best regards.

### 从一篇小说看文艺创作中的一种倾向

1950-03-12

专栏：

　　从一篇小说看文艺创作中的一种倾向编辑同志：
    看到新近出版的人民文学第一卷第五期上方纪同志的一篇短篇小说“让生活变得更美好罢”，我有一点意见。
    故事的内容是：老解放区农村里有一个贫农家的姑娘，年青，美丽，嗓子好，会演戏。她名叫小环，绰号“一枝花”。她喜欢和村里的男孩子们玩，差不多所有的年青小伙了们都被她吸住了。干部和老年人都对她有意见。村里成立贫农团，选举贫农团委员，男孩子们选举她，被一“老头”讽刺，没有通过。她受了刺激，从此收敛，不再和男孩子们往来。可是贫农团里没有她，年青人都“提不起劲”。到动员参军的时候，党的支部虽然用了各种方式动员，年青人，包括有些党员在内，报名的人却一个也没有。一位村干部知道问题就“在小环身上”，找小环谈了话。“不久，该村的参军运动就轰轰烈烈开展起来了。”当中有一名叫“大群”的首先报了名。“只两天功夫……一下子就超过了任务。”
    在欢送入伍的大会上，小环大胆地宣布她只和大群有爱情，并且驳斥人们对她的污蔑说：“我人穷命苦，难道心也得苦？”“我好玩，好乐，好闹，也不过是心里闷，想把日子过痛快一点罢了。”这样，她自己“咯咯地笑起来了”，“笑声像银铃一样荡漾在春天的太阳下，以致全场人都不得不跟着她笑起来了。尤其是那些青年男女们，像是小环替他（她）们说出了心里的话，笑得特别响亮……”
    我很怀疑：这篇作品的作者，为什么把一个所谓年青美丽的姑娘在人们的社会政治生活中所发生的力量，不正确地夸大到这样的地步呢？就以参军运动来说，难道我们翻身农民自动参军的政治觉悟还比不上一个漂亮姑娘所发生的作用吗？难道我们党在农村中长期对农民所进行的教育和政治上组织上的领导作用，也还不如一个漂亮姑娘所起的作用吗？作者这样地描写是合乎事实的吗？我认为这篇作品的思想是错误的，应该加以批判与纠正。此致敬礼！郝彤郝彤同志：
    “让生活变得更美好罢”是一篇不好的作品。你对这篇作品的怀疑与批评是完全应该的。
    对于这篇作品，单从标题上看，也可以知道作者是在表达这么一个主题思想：“平分土地，消灭了封建剥削”，但封建的思想和风俗习惯，还束缚着年青的一代，使他们不能生活得更美好。这些束缚应该消除，而且事实上也是“会慢慢消灭的；不过这些要比较慢一点罢了”。
    可是，应当说，作者表现这一主题的企图是失败了，他实际上是写了旁的事物。他的小说把一个姑娘在参军运动中的作用夸大到这种地步，以至把农民参加解放军的政治意义完全打消了！党的政治的和组织的动员力量，远不及一个漂亮姑娘的力量！
    毫无疑问，这是一种恋爱至上主义者或弗洛依德主义者对于人民政治生活和妇女社会作用的歪曲描写。
    很可惜，这种歪曲，竟然还是我国目前文艺创作中的一种颇为普遍的倾向。方纪同志的这篇作品还不是这种倾向的最突出的代表。它只是带有这种倾向的许多作品中的一个例子罢了。我们还可以举出不少的小说、鼓词、戏剧和电影是用类似的或者更严重的错误观点来解释生活的。在这些作品中，妇女似乎仅仅是“可爱的人”，仅仅是恋爱者或恋爱的对象或性欲的对象，并由此而产生了种种悲喜剧。某些文艺作者的这种对于妇女生活的不正确的态度和“兴味”，同样可以说明目前关于妓女的作品何以有一种程度的流行。当然，不少的妇女确曾被剥削阶级仅仅当作恋爱的或性欲的对象。但是，第一，这个时代已经发生了变化。妇女正在取得完全新的地位，对于妇女和对于整个社会生活的完全新的态度正在取得领导地位。新的作家的观察、表现和宣传的精力是应当用在这个方面，是应当用来宣传新的观点而批判旧的观点的。第二，就在描写某些妇女仅仅被某些剥削者当作恋爱的或性欲的对象的那种时代的时候，作家的任务也并不是要着重观察、表现和宣传这个时代的这一个侧面，因为这也并不是它的真正重要的侧面，而且就是那时的妇女生活，也有更重要的侧面。
    借着这个机会，我们希望新中国的文艺作家们，特别是共产党员的作家们，用新的正确的态度来对待妇女，对待包括妇女在内的社会生活，并用以教育人民。做这样的工作，现在是时候了！此致敬礼。
