    Shanxi Provincial Epidemic Prevention Team Plans to Inoculate 200,000 Head of Draught Animals
    [Report from this newspaper] According to a notice issued by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture on March 9th: In order to prevent the occurrence of livestock epidemics in the spring, Shanxi Province has decided to draw 84 technical cadres from the Veterinary Prevention Institute and students from the Veterinary Training Class to form an epidemic prevention team to focus on carrying out livestock epidemic prevention work in various special districts and counties. Last year, eleven counties including Xiyang, Heshun, and Zuoquan in the province experienced a widespread outbreak of bovine emphysema, with 1,500 cattle dying in Xiyang, Heshun, and Qinshui counties alone. In addition, seven counties including Wutai and Dingxiang continuously experienced anthrax last year, resulting in the deaths of 162 draught animals and 2,200 sheep. Based on past epidemic occurrences, the main focus this spring is on preventing bovine emphysema, anthrax in horses, mules, donkeys, and cattle, and rinderpest. The provincial epidemic prevention team will go to 37 counties where epidemics are expected to occur, inoculating 206,000 head of draught animals. At the same time, local veterinarians will be organized to prevent other livestock epidemics, and they will cooperate with local cadres to carry out propaganda and education work on the prevention of livestock epidemics. The provincial epidemic prevention team is scheduled to depart on March 16th and has been assigned inoculation areas and tasks.
