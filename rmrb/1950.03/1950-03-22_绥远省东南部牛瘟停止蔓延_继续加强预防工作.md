[Reported by this newspaper] Rinderpest occurred in eleven counties including Jining and Xinghe, and four banners including Zheng Hong and Zheng Huang, in eastern and southern Suiyuan Province in December last year. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government immediately dispatched 54 veterinary personnel to rush to various places for treatment. After two and a half months of efforts, the spread of rinderpest has now stopped. During this outbreak, it is estimated that more than 1,000 cattle died. 1,700 sick cattle were cured, and rabbit-adapted virus vaccinations were administered to 40,000 cattle. Currently, in addition to the original veterinary prevention and treatment personnel continuing to carry out preventive vaccination work in various places, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, in order to eradicate rinderpest, has decided to carry out preventive vaccinations on all 350,000 cattle in the province. Based on this prevention and treatment experience, and in conjunction with this year's livestock production increase plan, the following measures have been taken systematically: (1) Instructing administrative cadres at all levels to closely cooperate with veterinary personnel, constantly pay attention to the epidemic situation, and provide information quickly and accurately, overcoming the past tendency of paralysis and lack of attention to rinderpest. Veterinary personnel must also conduct more investigations, understand more, and actively unite with administrative cadres. (2) Ensuring that propaganda and mobilization work is done well. According to the situation in various places, different forms of propaganda can be used (such as oral persuasion, cartoons, pamphlets, ditties, clapper talks, dramas, etc.) to break the masses' superstitions and prevent saboteurs from spreading rumors and obstructing vaccination work. (3) Mobilizing and organizing rural women and children to set up rinderpest inspection stations to assist the government in conscientiously implementing epidemic area blockades and isolating diseased livestock. (4) In addition to strengthening the existing epidemic prevention station in Jining, eastern Suiyuan, epidemic prevention stations will also be added in Ulanqab League, Yikezhao League, Wuyuan, and Helin. (5) Promoting grass storage, building pens, and improving feeding management methods. (Suiyuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry)

　　绥远省东南部牛瘟停止蔓延
    继续加强预防工作
    【本报讯】绥远省东部、南部之集宁、兴和等十一县及正红、正黄等四旗，去年十二月先后发生牛瘟，绥远省人民政府当即赶派兽医人员五十四名，分赴各地抢治。经过了两个半月的努力，目前牛瘟已停止蔓延。此次牛疫，计死亡牛千头以上，经治好的病牛有一千七百头，并为四万头牛施行了兔化毒预防注射。现在，除原有兽医防治人员仍在各地继续进行预防注射工作外，绥远省人民政府为了根绝牛疫，已决定把全省三十五万头牛全部施行预防注射，并根据此次防治经验，结合本年畜产增殖计划，有步骤地采取了以下措施：（一）指示各级行政干部与兽医人员密切配合，经常注意疫情，迅速而确实地提供情报；克服过去麻痹和不重视牛疫的偏向。兽疫人员更须要多调查、多了解，主动地和行政干部团结。（二）要保证把宣传动员工作做好，按照各地情况，可利用各种不同的宣传方式（如口头说服、漫画、小册子、小调、快板、话剧等），打破群众的迷信，并防止破坏分子造谣阻碍注射工作。（三）动员并组织农村妇女、儿童，设立牛疫检查站，以协助政府认真实行疫区封锁和疫畜隔离。（四）除加强已设立的绥东集宁的防疫站外，并增设乌盟、伊盟、五原、和林等防疫站。（五）提倡储草、搭圈、改进饲养管理方法。（绥远省农林厅）
