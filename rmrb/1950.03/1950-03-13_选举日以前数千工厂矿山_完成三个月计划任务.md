Thousands of Factories and Mines Complete Three-Month Production Plan Before Election Day
    The Soviet people are also greeting the election of the Supreme Soviet with a new wave of labor enthusiasm. News of victories in work has been pouring in from all over the country. From collective farms on the Pacific coast to Moldavia, from oil fields in Baku to factories in Leningrad and Riga, thousands of factories, mines, and oil field workers have already completed their three-month production plan before election day. The personnel of the power plant, who first nominated Stalin as a candidate for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, are working hard to complete the entire five-year plan's production volume before the 12th.
    On March 11, the Soviet Pravda and other major newspapers published editorials calling on voters to go to the polls on election day to elect candidates from the Stalin Party and the non-Party alliance. Pravda published an editorial titled "Everyone Go to the Polls on Election Day," stating: March 12 is the election day of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, a day of great victory for the Soviet people. On this day, millions of voters will go to the polling stations to elect candidates from the Stalin Party and the non-Party alliance. On this great holiday, the Soviet working people will show the world their infinite loyalty to the Lenin-Stalin Party, their love for the great leader and mentor, the creator of people's happiness—their own Stalin.

　　选举日以前数千工厂矿山
    完成三个月计划任务
    苏联人民同时以新的劳动热潮来迎接最高苏维埃的选举。全国各地均传来了在工作中获得胜利的消息。从太平洋岸到摩尔达维亚的集体农场，从巴库的油田到列宁格勒和里加的工厂，数千个工厂、矿山与油田的人员，业已完成了他们要在选举日前完成三个月计划的任务。首先提名斯大林为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的电力工厂人员，正在努力于十二日前完成全部五年计划的生产量。
    三月十一日，苏联真理报及其他各大报均发表社论，号召选民们都在选举日去投票选举斯大林党与非党联盟的候选人。真理报以《选举那天大家都去投票》为题，发表社论称：三月十二日是苏联最高苏维埃的选举日，是苏联人民伟大胜利的日子。千百万选民将在这一天前往投票站选举斯大林党与非党联盟的候选人。苏联劳动人民在这一大节日，将向全世界表明他们对列宁——斯大林党的无限忠诚，他们对伟大领袖与导师、人民幸福的创造者——他们自己的斯大林的热爱。
