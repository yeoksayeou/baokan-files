　　Chahar Province's January Tax Revenue
    Completes Over 90% of the Task
    Datong City Exceeds 49%
    [From Our Newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily News of March 19th: In January, Chahar Province's tax revenue, encompassing ten categories including transaction tax, goods tax, industrial and commercial tax, temporary business tax, stamp tax, and slaughter tax, collectively completed more than 91.3% of the planned collection target. Furthermore, Zhangjiakou City, Datong City, and the Chahar South Special District completed the outstanding amounts of industrial and commercial tax and license tax from December of last year. The completion rates are as follows: Datong City exceeded its original assigned target by 49.7%, the Chahar South Special District exceeded its original assigned target by slightly less than 3.2%, the Chahar North Special District completed slightly less than 87.7% of its assigned target, Zhangjiakou City completed 77.4%, the Yanbei Special District only completed 74.8%, and Xuanhua City completed 74.4%.
    Judging from the degree of completion by the various special districts and city tax bureaus, Datong City ranked first, while Zhangjiakou City, the Yanbei Special District, and Xuanhua City performed the worst. The reason for Datong City's success is that its bureau frequently organized cadres to read and study relevant tax revenue directives, thereby making the cadres more proficient in tax revenue operations. In addition, they focused closely on the political education of cadres, ensuring that each cadre's work morale was consistently high, and their work was also relatively thorough. Zhangjiakou City demonstrated sluggishness and a lack of initiative in its work. For example, regarding this supplementary collection of goods tax, the bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce scheduled the deployment of the goods tax for February 15th, but it actually didn't begin until February 20th. After the Provincial Tax Bureau understood this situation, it immediately dispatched seven cadres to assist in this work, and the supplementary collection officially began in early March.

　　察省一月份税收
    完成任务九成以上
    大同市超过百分之四十九
    【本报讯】据三月十九日察哈尔日报消息：察省一月份税收，在交易税、货物税、工商业税、临时营业税、印花税、屠宰税等十种中，共完成预定征收任务的百分之九一·三以上。此外张家口市、大同市及察南等三个专区并完成了去年十二月份工商业税、牌照税的尾欠数字。完成任务的情况是：大同市超过原分配任务百分之四九·七，察南专区超过原分配任务百分之三·二弱，察北专区完成分配任务百分之八七·七弱，张家口市完成百分之七七·四，雁北专区只完成百分之七四·八，宣化市完成百分之七四·四。
    由各专、市税务局完成的程度来看，以大同市为第一，张家口市、雁北专区、宣化市为最差。大同市能够完成的原因，该局在领导上经常组织干部阅读研究有关税收的指示文件，因之干部在税收业务上比较熟练；另外对干部政治教育抓得很紧，每个干部工作情绪经常饱满，在工作上亦比较深入。张家口市在工作上表现拖拉，不够主动。如这次补征货物税，该局与工商联合会预定二月十五日布置货物税，实际上要等到二月二十日才开始，省税务局了解这一情况后，立即派七名干部来协助这一工作，于三月初才正式开始补征。
