Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th. The Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union's method of establishing a mutual aid fund has proven to be an effective measure for resolving the unexpected financial needs of its employees. In December of last year, the bureau's trade union's first member representative congress approved the establishment of a mutual aid fund and established a mutual aid committee. The method stipulates that those willing to participate in the mutual aid society will store one "real unit" per month as a mutual aid fund, for a temporary period of six months. Anyone with financial needs due to childbirth, marriage, illness, accidental disaster, death of a direct relative, or other special circumstances may borrow from this mutual aid fund. The amount of the loan is determined based on the specific situation, after review by the member group, and generally should not exceed one hundred "real units." In special major events, it should not exceed two hundred "real units." After the loan is made, it will be deducted from the borrower's monthly salary in installments over two to six months. If an employee dies, those participating in the mutual aid fund will also donate an additional five per thousand of their monthly salary. Currently, 1,291 employees are participating, accounting for more than 96% of the total number of employees in the bureau. The total amount of mutual aid funds loaned due to the death of employees or their direct relatives or due to accidental disasters has reached 3,610 "real units." Initially, there were deviations in the mutual aid fund's lending process, such as democratic group discussions and branch opinions becoming mere formalities, and the mutual aid committee's average use of the mutual aid fund. After the mutual aid committee reviewed the situation, the lending method was revised, and the lending amounts and scope were clearly defined. After the loan is made, the mutual aid committee will also publish the applicant's loan situation in detail to solicit the opinions of the masses for joint supervision.

　　南京电讯局工会
    设立互助基金
    职工福利进一步获保障
    【新华社南京二十八日电】南京电讯局工会设立互助基金的办法，已被证明是解决职工们意外的经济需要的有效措施。去年十二月该局工会第一次会员代表大会通过了设立互助金的办法，并成立了互助委员会。办法规定，愿意参加互助会的，每人每月存储一个折实单位作互助基金，时间暂以六个月为限。凡因生育、结婚、疾病、意外灾害、直系亲属死亡及其他特殊经济困难者，即可借贷此项互助金。借贷数目根据具体情况先经会员小组审查确定，一般不得超过一百个折实单位，特殊重大事件，亦不得超过二百个折实单位。借贷后在二个至六个月内在贷款人的月薪中分期扣还。如有职工死亡，参加互助金者每人还另外捐助月薪的千分之五。现在参加的职工已有一千二百九十一人，占全局职工总人数的百分之九十六以上；因职工或其直系亲属死亡或遭受意外灾害而贷出的互助金总计达三千六百一十个折实单位。互助基金的借贷最初曾发生民主小组评议和分会签注意见流于形式和互助委员会对互助基金平均使用等偏向，经互助委员会检讨后，借贷办法已予修正，明确规定了借贷数字和范围。贷款后互助委员会并将申请人贷款情形详细公布，征求群众的意见，由大家来共同监督。
