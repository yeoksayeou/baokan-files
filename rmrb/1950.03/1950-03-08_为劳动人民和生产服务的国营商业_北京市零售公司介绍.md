　　State-Owned Commerce Serving the Laboring People and Production
    Introduction to Beijing Retail Company
    Wei Jin
    Since its establishment in March of last year, the Beijing State-Owned Grain Company has directly supplied grain to working citizens with the assistance of cooperatives, grain consignment stores, and grain retail stores (operated by the grain company). However, due to the inability of cooperatives to quickly establish widespread organizations, they could only supply grain to approximately 300,000 members. Grain consignment stores (operated concurrently by private merchants) engaged in numerous malpractices in the sale of grain (such as deceiving and exploiting the masses through adulteration, substitution, purchase restrictions, and using small scales), seriously damaging the relationship between state-owned trade and the masses, causing significant losses to state trade, and preventing the masses from benefiting. Although there were state-owned grain retail stores at the time, their limited organization prevented them from supplying more grain to the citizens. Consequently, the state-owned grain company had to wholesale grain on the market, supplying citizens through private merchants, which allowed some unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to stir up trouble, hoarding and refusing to sell grain wholesaled by the grain company at fair prices, driving up prices, and fueling price increases. In particular, during the price fluctuations in mid-November of last year, unscrupulous merchants engaged in large-scale speculation and manipulation. At that time, a large quantity of grain sold by the grain company was raised by unscrupulous merchants to double the wholesale price (for example, flour, with a wholesale price of 22,500 yuan per bag, was raised to a retail price of 45,000 yuan) and was still difficult to buy. This not only caused significant losses to state grain but also threatened the lives of the broad masses of working citizens. In order to eliminate speculation, stabilize prices, and ensure that state grain effectively supplies the broad masses of working citizens, stabilize the people's lives, and restore and develop production, the government decided to establish a large number of retail organizations to specifically supply citizens with grain and essential goods. Thus, the Beijing Retail Company was established in mid-November of last year with the help of all parties.

    The first principle of the Retail Company's business policy is to widely establish retail organizations. Second, to appropriately control prices. On the one hand, to enable citizens to buy grain at fair prices, and on the other hand, not to affect the development of legitimate industry and commerce. Third, to control grain transportation and processing, so that the quantity, type, and quality of grain meet the needs of the masses. Fourth, to improve business methods, simplify grain purchase procedures, eliminate "official" thinking, patiently solicit customers, and make business hours as convenient as possible for the masses. According to the above policies, the Retail Company established fourteen business offices, one hundred and thirty-four grain retail stores, thirty cotton cloth retail and consignment stores, and two hundred and fifty-one coal briquette consignment stores in Beijing.

    Due to the correct implementation of the above measures, the Retail Company gradually contacted the masses and consolidated its retail position. Since the opening of the Retail Company, according to statistics from December of last year and January of this year, an average of more than 6 million jin of grain was supplied each month. In February, the supply of grain even reached 11 million jin. Compared with the more than 2.1 million jin of grain supplied by the retail stores operated by the grain company before the establishment of the Retail Company, i.e., in October of last year, the supply capacity has increased by two to five times. In addition to the supply of cooperatives to their members and the direct supply of grain by the grain company to some institutions and schools, the state grain supply to working citizens accounts for about 50% to 60% of the city's population, thus the Retail Company actively controls the grain retail market.

    The retail prices set by the Retail Company play a leading role in the market. For example, the market prices were once chaotic during the Retail Company's holiday on the first and second days of the Lunar New Year. On the third day of the Lunar New Year, the Retail Company began business and set grain prices, and market prices immediately fell. For example, flour had risen from 80,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan; after the grain price was posted, it fell to 90,000 yuan. Sorghum and millet had risen from 1,400 yuan to 1,800 yuan; after the grain price was posted, it fell to 1,400 yuan. Mutton had risen from 7,000 yuan to more than 9,000 yuan; after the grain price was posted, it fell to more than 7,000 yuan. "Smoking Pipe" brand cigarettes had risen from 30,000 yuan to 41,000 yuan; after the grain price was posted, it fell to 35,000 yuan. The prices of all essential goods are in line with the Retail Company's posted prices. The Retail Company's posted prices have become the reasonable standard prices for essential goods in the retail market.

    According to the work of the Beijing Retail Company during this period, the establishment of the Retail Company is indispensable for the management of markets in large and medium-sized cities. It ensures that state grain is directly and effectively supplied to the broad masses of working citizens, protects their lives, and in turn protects the restoration and development of production. It also assists the grain company in controlling market prices: the grain company controls wholesale prices, and it controls retail prices, powerfully打击打击打击打投投机投机投机商人投机商人商人, and stabilizes market prices. Its future development, in addition to operating grain, coal, cloth, and salt, can also operate department stores, so that the supply of essential goods for the broad masses of working citizens will be better guaranteed.

　　为劳动人民和生产服务的国营商业
    北京市零售公司介绍
    维进
    北京市国营粮食公司，去年三月成立以来曾经先后经过合作社、粮食代售店、粮食零售店（粮食公司经营的）的协助，把国家粮食直接供应劳动市民。但是，由于合作社不能很快普遍建立组织，仅能供应约三十万社员的粮食。粮食代售店（系私商兼任）经售粮食曾发生许多毛病（如以掺假、巧替、套购、小秤等欺骗剥削群众），严重地破坏了国营贸易与群众的关系，使国家贸易吃亏很大，群众得不到实惠。当时虽有国营粮食零售店，因组织不普遍亦不能更多的供应市民粮食。以致国营粮食公司不得不将粮食在市场批发，通过私商供应市民，于是一些奸商便趁机兴风作浪，将粮食公司以公道价格所批发的粮食，囤积拒售，哄抬物价，助长物价上涨。特别是在去年十一月中旬物价波动时，奸商大肆投机操纵。当时粮食公司出售的大批粮食，竟被奸商把零售价格提高到批发价的一倍（如面粉，批发价每袋二万二千五百元，零售价竟提高至四万五千元）还不容易买到。不但使国家粮食损失很大，且使广大劳动市民的生活感受威胁。政府为取缔投机，稳定物价，使国家粮食真正有效地供应广大劳动市民，以安定人民生活，恢复发展生产，乃决定大量建立零售组织，专门负责供应市民粮食及生活必需品，于是北京市零售公司在去年十一月中旬，得到各方面的帮助，建立起来了。
    零售公司开展业务方针的第一条，就是普遍建立零售组织。第二，适当掌握价格。一方面使市民能以公道的价格买到粮食，一方面又不影响正当工商业的发展。第三，掌握粮食调运和加工，使粮食的数量、种类、质量适合群众需要。第四，改善经营方法，简化购粮手续；去掉“官办”思想，耐心招徕主顾；营业时间，尽可能做到适应群众的需要。根据上述方针，零售公司在北京共设了十四个营业处，粮食零售店一百三十四个，花纱布零售店和代售店三十个，煤球代售店二百五十一个。
    零售公司由于正确执行上述措施，逐渐联系群众，巩固零售阵地。零售公司开业以来，据去年十二月和今年一月的统计，每月均供应粮食六百余万斤。二月份供应粮食更达一千一百万斤。这和零售公司成立以前即去年十月份，由粮食公司经营的零售店供应粮食二百一十余万斤相比较，供应能力增加了二倍至五倍之多。加上合作社对于社员的供应，及粮食公司直接对一些机关学校的供应，国家粮食供给于劳动市民的占全市人口约百分之五十至六十，因而零售公司主动地掌握了粮食零售市场。
    零售公司所规定的零售价格在市场起着领导作用。如春节初一、初二日零售公司休假，市场物价曾经一度混乱。初三日零售公司开始营业，规定粮食牌价，市场物价随即回落。如面粉曾由八万元涨到十二万元；粮价挂牌后，落到九万元。高粱、小米曾由一千四百元涨到一千八百元，粮价挂牌后，落到一千四百元。羊肉曾由七千元涨到九千余元，粮价挂牌后，落到七千余元，烟斗牌纸烟曾由三万元涨到四万一千元，粮价挂牌后，落到三万五千元。一切生活必需品的价格，均向零售公司的牌价看齐。零售公司的牌价，成为零售市场生活必需品合理的标准价格。
    根据北京零售公司这一段工作看来，零售公司的设立，是大、中城市管理市场所不可缺少的。它保证把国家粮食直接有效地供应广大劳动市民，保障他们的生活，进而保障生产的恢复与发展。它并协助粮食公司掌握市场价格：粮食公司掌握批发价格，它掌握零售价格，有力地打击投机商人，稳定了市场物价。它的发展前途，除了经营粮食、煤、布、盐以外，还可以经营百货，使广大劳动市民的生活必需品的供应，将得到更好的保证。
