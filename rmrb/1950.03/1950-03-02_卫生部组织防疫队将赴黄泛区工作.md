The Ministry of Health Organizes Epidemic Prevention Team to Work in the Yellow River Flood Area

[This newspaper report] The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has organized a new epidemic prevention team, which will go to the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan and northern Anhui in early March to carry out epidemic prevention and medical work. The Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan and northern Anhui includes more than 20 counties with a population of more than six million. In 1938, the Kuomintang reactionary government broke the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou, turning this vast area into a swamp. After Huayuankou was closed in the winter of 1946, the Yellow River returned to its old course. Millions of disaster victims returned to their homes that had been flooded by the river for many years, and suffered the ravages of the Kuomintang reactionary government and two years of waterlogging, drought, and insect plagues. After liberation, the State Council of the Central People's Government designated the Financial and Economic Committee, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, and the Ministry of Health to form the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee to coordinate disaster relief, recovery, and epidemic prevention work in the Yellow River flood area. Recently, the Ministry of Health convened a special meeting for this purpose and decided to send an epidemic prevention team to work in the Yellow River flood area. The team includes 100 staff members, led by Dr. Li Hemin of the Central Institute of Health. They are preparing for the departure. It is expected that the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee will allocate 3 million jin of wheat as medical expenses.

　　卫生部组织防疫队将赴黄泛区工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府卫生部组织了一个新的防疫队，将于下月初旬赴豫东、皖北的黄泛区进行防疫和医疗工作。豫东、皖北的黄泛区包括二十余县，人口六百余万。一九三八年，国民党反动政府在花园口掘开黄河堤，使此广大地区沦为泽国。一九四六年冬花园口合龙后，黄河仍回故道。数百万灾民回到被河水冲渍多年的家园，又遭受了国民党反动政府的蹂躏与两年来的水旱虫灾。解放以后，中央人民政府政务院指定由中央财经委员会、内务部、水利部、农业部、林垦部和卫生部会商组成黄泛区复兴委员会，统筹黄泛区救灾、恢复和防疫工作。最近，卫生部为此召集了专门会议，决定派防疫队前往黄泛区工作。该队包括工作人员一百人，由中央卫生实验院李河民大夫任队长。正准备出发前的工作。预计要由黄泛区复兴委员会拨发三百万斤小麦，作为医药费用。
