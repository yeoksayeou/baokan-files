Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The West German people's movement to strive for democratic unification and world peace is growing day by day. According to a report by the Telegraph Agency on the 14th, the people of Hesse Province in the American occupation zone held a peace demonstration, resolutely opposing the rearmament of West Germany by US imperialism. Factories, organizations and parties in the province are actively preparing for the peace conference to be held on May 7th. According to a TASS report on the 16th, the "League for German Unification" has been established in Munich to guide the work in Bavaria Province. Hamburg, an important industrial city in the British occupation zone, has also established a "Committee for Peace" with representatives from all walks of life, and is carrying out its work. West German youth have enthusiastically responded to the call of East German youth, and are actively fighting for a democratic and unified Germany.

    At the same time, the Western occupying authorities are also strengthening their suppression measures. According to TASS reports on the 17th and 18th, the British military court has illegally sentenced Haullander, the secretary of the Communist Party of Lower Saxony, and Sterczebach, the editor of the "People's Voice" newspaper. They were tried for defending the interests of the working people and opposing the British occupying authorities' illegal dismantling of West German enterprises. The British military court also illegally arrested and interrogated Leimann, a member of the state parliament. This matter has aroused great anger and protest from the German people. Tens of thousands of people in Hamburg gathered in front of the British military office to demonstrate, demanding the release of Leimann and the revocation of the shameful verdict. The Central Plenary Session of the German Socialist Unity Party also passed a resolution demanding the immediate revocation of the shameful verdict and calling on the people to support it.

　　反对美帝重新武装西德
    西德和平运动日益开展
    汉堡人民抗议英帝非法逮捕审讯
    【新华社二十九日讯】西德人民争取民主统一与世界和平的运动，正日益开展中。据电通社十四日报道，美占区黑森省的人民举行了和平示威大会，坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装西德。该省各工厂、社团与党派，正积极筹备五月七日召开的和平大会。另据塔斯社十六日消息，慕尼黑已成立“争取德国统一联盟”，以指导巴伐利亚省的工作。英占区的重要工业城市汉堡，也成立了各界人民代表参加的“争取和平委员会”，并在展开工作中。西德青年已热烈响应东德青年的号召，积极为争取民主统一的德国而斗争。
    与此同时，西方占领当局也在加强镇压措施。据塔斯社十七、十八日消息，英国军事法庭已非法判决下萨克森州共产党书记豪楞德尔与《人民之声》报主笔斯特柴巴赫，他们是因保卫劳动人民利益与反对英国占领当局非法拆卸西德企事而受审的。英国军事法庭并非法逮捕与审讯该州议员莱曼。此事已激起德国人民的莫大愤怒与抗议。汉堡成千成万的人民齐集英军办事处门前示威，要求释放莱曼并撤销可耻的判决。德国统一社会党中央全会也通过决议，要求立即撤销可耻的判决，并号召人民予以声援。
