　　Fengtai Locomotive Depot Yang Kezhen
    Successfully Modified Two Types of Air Compressors
    [This Newspaper] Yang Kezhen, a mechanical foreman at Fengtai Locomotive Depot, drawing on years of practical work experience and diligently studying technology, successfully modified vertical and horizontal air compressors, and self-made Walschaerts valve gear washers, making significant contributions to improving production and saving expenses. Yang Kezhen is an old worker in his forties who suffered greatly under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. After liberation, his class consciousness rapidly increased, and he actively studied and improved machinery in various ways. Previously, he was awarded the honorary title of Third-Class Meritorious Person at the Tianjin Railway Bureau commendation conference for successfully trial-producing air compressor spring plates, saving the country a lot of expenses. Recently, he has continuously created and improved several kinds of machinery: The vertical air compressor at the Langfang Water Supply Station used to require three boilers to barely drive it. After Yang Kezhen carefully studied it during major repairs and appropriately modified the wrong valve gear port, the result was that one boiler could be saved, and two boilers could drive it. According to February statistics, this saved a total of 127 tons of coal. The horizontal air compressor at the station vibrated severely during operation due to the damage to the ball cage, which seriously affected the work. Recently, after careful study by Yang Kezhen, only a one-inch iron plate was added in the middle of the old ball cage, and the test run showed that it was exactly the same as a new one. According to Yang Kezhen, it can be guaranteed to continue to be used for more than ten years. Due to Yang Kezhen's successful manufacture of Walschaerts valve gear washers, the original repair man-hours can be reduced by two-thirds, and the mechanical efficiency can be enhanced.

　　丰台机务段杨克珍
    改修两种打风机成功
    【本报讯】丰台机务段机械工长杨克珍，积多年实际工作经验，苦心钻研技术，改修立式打风机、卧式打风机，自制华氏抽水机瓦路洗子成功，对提高生产，节省开支贡献极大。杨克珍是四十多岁的老工人，过去受尽了国民党反动统治的欺压，解放后阶级觉悟迅速提高，多方积极研究改进机械。前此因试制打风机弹簧片成功，节省国家很多开支，在天津铁路局庆功大会上荣获三等功臣的光荣称号。最近又连续创造和改进了几种机械：郎坊给水所之立式打风机，过去用三个锅炉方勉强带动，经杨克珍在大修时经过细心研究，将错汽门瓦路口改修适当，结果可节省一个锅炉，用二个锅炉即可带动。据二月份统计，这样共省煤一二七吨。该所卧式打风机，因球架子损坏，平日运转摆动得很厉害，严重影响工作。最近经过杨克珍的细心研究，仅在旧球架子中间加了一英寸的铁板，试车结果完全和新的一样。据杨克珍谈：可保证继续使用十几年。由于杨克珍制造华氏抽水机瓦路洗子成功，可较原来修理工时节省三分之二，并可增强机械效率。（丰台机务段颜景文）
