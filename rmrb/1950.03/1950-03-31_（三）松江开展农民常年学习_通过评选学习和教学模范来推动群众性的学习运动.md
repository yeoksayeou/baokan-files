　　(III) Songjiang Launches Year-Round Farmer Learning
    Promoting Mass Learning Movements Through Selection of Learning and Teaching Models
    [Report from this Newspaper] In order to consolidate the existing achievements of winter schools, summarize learning experiences, and systematically transform winter schools into regular learning organizations for farmers, Songjiang Province convened village, district, and county-level model winter school award conferences in early March. A total of 1,528 model students, 391 model teachers, and 187 model cadres were awarded throughout the province. From March 20th to 23rd, the Provincial People's Government convened a provincial literacy movement award conference, attended by 139 model students and teachers from winter schools in various counties. At the meeting, exemplary reports were first made, introducing model deeds, followed by a discussion of this year's learning plan. The plan stipulates that on the basis of winter schools, farmers will be organized for regular learning, ensuring that all participants will know 1,000 characters by the end of the year. Learning methods will be flexibly applied according to the seasons, divided into three stages throughout the year: spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest. During spring plowing, learning can be combined with production teams, with decentralized learning, where the learning group leader receives characters from the teacher and assigns them to students for study. After the first weeding is completed, concentrated learning can be conducted for a period, summarizing the learning of this stage, holding exams and awarding prizes. Decentralized learning will then be conducted again during the second weeding.
    At the meeting, models from various regions spontaneously launched challenges. Huang Guizhen, a model from Hulan County, proposed when challenging Shi Chengfa, a provincial special-class model: By the end of the year, she will not only become a learning model but also a production model. Subsequently, more than 20 people took the stage to challenge Shi Chengfa; models who did not take the stage also wrote challenge letters one after another.
    On the last day of the conference, Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, personally awarded prizes to all the models and presented glorious flowers to five special-class models. The Director of the Provincial Department of Education called on everyone at the closing ceremony to learn from the special-class models; after returning, they should tell the local masses about the experiences and learning methods introduced at the conference, so that the masses can participate in learning and achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy. At the same time, everyone should actively lead the masses to overcome difficulties, combine learning with production, and create various methods to promote learning.

　　（三）松江开展农民常年学习
    通过评选学习和教学模范来推动群众性的学习运动
    【本报讯】松江省为巩固冬学现有成绩，总结学习经验，并有计划地把冬学转为农民经常性的学习组织，各县已于三月上旬先召开了村、区、县三级奖励冬学模范大会，全省共有一千五百二十八名模范学员、三百九十一名模范教师，一百八十七名模范干部受到奖励。三月二十日至二十三日，该省人民政府又召开了全省识字运动奖励模范大会，出席此次会议的有各县冬学模范学员和教师一百三十九人。会上首先作了典型报告，介绍了模范事迹，继即讨论了今年的学习计划。计划中预定在冬学基础上，组织农民进行经常的学习，保证全体参加学习的人到年底都识一千字。学习的方式按季节灵活运用，全年分春耕、夏锄、秋收三个阶段进行。春耕时可结合生产小组，进行分散的学习，由学习小组长向教员领字布置学员学习。铲完头遍地又可集中学习一个时期，并总结此一阶段的学习，举行考试及奖励。到铲二遍地时再行分散学习。
    会议上，各地模范自发地展开挑战。呼兰县模范黄桂珍向省特等模范石成发挑战时提出：她到年底不但要当上学习模范，还要当上生产模范。接着有二十余人登上主席台向石成发挑战；没上台的模范也纷纷写了挑战书。
    大会最后一日，由省人民政府冯仲云主席亲自给全体模范授奖，并为五名特等模范戴光荣花。省府教育厅长在大会闭幕式上号召大家向特等模范看齐；回去以后要把大会上介绍的经验与学习方法告诉当地群众，使群众都参加学习，以达消灭文盲的目的。同时，要大家积极带领群众克服困难，结合生产进行学习，创造出各种办法来推动学习。
