　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th: Since liberation, with the development of various social reforms in Central China, women – especially working women – have actively participated in rural social reforms, production for disaster relief, urban construction, and other work, contributing significantly. At the same time, their work has also improved women’s economic lives and raised their political and social status.

　　Before liberation, the vast number of working women in rural Central China lived inhuman lives under the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal landlords. Tens of thousands of young women were raped and abused by bandits and bullies. In the rural areas of Henan, there was an even more sinful trend of selling and seizing widows. Many peasant women, whose husbands were either conscripted by the Chiang bandit gang or lost due to famine, were bought, sold, and abused by landlords and bullies. Women who resisted such violence were humiliated or killed. In the cities, women also lived miserable lives. Some dock women in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, were still required to carry heavy goods even during pregnancy, while their wages were reduced by 20% by the bosses. The working hours of women in the knitting and homespun industries in Changsha, Hunan, were as long as sixteen or seventeen hours a day, seriously damaging their health. Moreover, at the Anjiang No. 1 Cotton Mill, many female workers suffered from lung diseases due to poor sanitation. In addition, most urban intellectual women were economically dependent, had no freedom of marriage, and were constantly threatened by unemployment and lack of education.

　　After liberation, enlightened and educated by the People's Government and the Communist Party, the oppressed women rapidly raised their consciousness and organized themselves. In Henan Province alone, one million working women participated in their own organizations under the leadership of the People's Government last year. In the agricultural associations in the areas of the province where land reform has been implemented, more than 30% of the members are women. Women's organizations in Jiangxi Province have also developed rapidly. By October of last year, preparatory committees for women's federations had been established in Nanchang, Jiujiang, Shangrao, Jingdezhen, and other cities. By December, according to incomplete statistics from the rural areas of the three districts of Nanchang, Shangrao, and Yuanzhou, more than 45,000 women had participated in their own organizations. In Changsha, Hunan Province, more than 3,000 women have been organized into the production departments of clothing factories, sack factories, and production cooperatives in the past six months. In Wuhan, more than 10,000 female workers (one-third of the city's 30,000 female workers) had been organized by December of last year. Currently, more than 2,000 of the 9,000 female workers in the city's 26 factories are participating in study. Under their influence, the intellectual women of Wuhan have also been well organized, establishing 17 night schools and study groups. In addition, women in Xiaogan and Xiangyang districts and Wuchang County in Hubei Province are also beginning to organize.

　　Like men, once women are organized, they immediately form a strong social force, playing a huge role in various tasks. The working women in the rural areas of Henan Province showed great courage in land reform, creating many model deeds and becoming an active force in land reform work. These women also enjoy the same rights as men, receiving a share of land and achieving economic independence. With the development of the struggle, they not only demanded the complete elimination of the feudal system but also put forward new demands such as freedom of marriage, family democracy, learning culture, and participating in political activities. Rural women actively participated in sentry duty, guiding the way, delivering intelligence, and scouting out the enemy during the suppression of bandits, and assisted the troops in capturing bandits. Female workers, intellectual women, and housewives in Wuhan have played a significant role in the work of taking over the pseudo-trade unions, rejecting silver dollars, supporting the army on August 1st, signing collective labor-management contracts, and promoting public bonds since liberation. Under the education of the organization, the class consciousness of the female workers in the city has greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. The female workers of the No. 1 Cotton Mill overcame the difficult conditions of "old machines and shortage of raw materials," increasing the yarn output from 80 sets (400 pounds per set) per day to 150 sets.

　　With the important role that women play in economic and political life, the social status of women has been greatly improved. For example, among the fourteen union preparatory committee members elected by the workers in Changsha, seven were female workers. All the village chiefs of the ten natural villages in Changsong Township, Anlu County, Hubei Province, are women. Seven working women from Henan Province were elected to attend the National Women's Congress held in Beijing in March of last year, gaining the support and love of the masses. In Lushan County, Henan Province, many women have also been promoted to leadership positions in county, district, and township-level governments and agricultural associations, and many of them have been admitted to the Communist Party.

　　华中妇女地位提高
    积极参加土地改革生产建设     
    河南省百万妇女已组织起来
    【新华社汉口七日电】华中各地解放后，随着各种社会改革工作的开展，妇女群众——特别是劳动妇女——积极地参加农村社会改革、生产救灾、城市建设等工作，贡献了很大的力量。在工作中也同时改善了妇女们的经济生活，提高了她们的政治和社会地位。
    解放前，华中广大农村劳动妇女，在国民党反动派和封建地主的迫害下，长期地过着非人的生活。成千成万的青年妇女遭受到匪徒、恶霸的奸淫蹂躏。在河南农村中更有一种卖寡妇和抢寡妇的罪恶风气。很多因被蒋匪帮抓丁抓走丈夫或因灾荒失去丈夫的农妇，被地主恶霸买卖和蹂躏。反抗这种强暴的妇女就会被凌辱或杀死。在城市里，妇女们也同样过着悲惨的生活。江西赣州市有些码头女工，就是在怀孕期间也仍须挑运沉重的货物，而所得的工资却要被老板扣去十分之二。湖南长沙的针织业和土布业女工，每日的工作时间竟长达十六、七小时，严重的损害了女工们的健康。而在安江第一纱厂，更因卫生设备太差，许多女工都患了肺病。此外，城市知识妇女，也大部分经济不独立，婚姻不自由，失业、失学的阴影也随时在威胁着她们。
    解放后，被压迫的妇女们经人民政府和共产党的教育启发后，觉悟迅速提高，纷纷组织起来。河南省在去年一年中，即有一百万工农妇女在人民政府的领导下参加了自己的组织；在该省已实行土地改革的地区的农会里，其中有百分之三十以上的会员是妇女。江西省的妇女组织也得到了迅速的发展，去年十月，南昌、九江、上饶、景德镇等市已建立妇联筹委会。到十二月，据南昌、上饶、袁州三个分区农村中的不完全统计，即已有四万五千多个妇女参加了自己的组织。湖南省长沙市，半年来有三千多个妇女在被服厂、麻袋厂和生产合作社的生产部门中组织起来。武汉市的女工在去年十二月里就有一万多人（占全市三万女工的三分之一）已组织起来；现全市二十六个工厂九千多女工中，有二千多人参加了学习。在她们的影响下，武汉市的知识妇女也很好地组织起来，成立了十七个夜校和学习小组。此外，湖北省孝感、襄阳分区和武昌县的妇女也正在开始进行组织。
    跟男子一样，妇女们一经组织起来，就立刻形成为一支壮大的社会力量，在各种工作中，发挥了巨大的作用。河南省农村的劳动妇女，在土地改革中，表现很勇敢，创造了不少模范事迹，成为土地改革工作中的一支积极的力量。这些妇女也和男子享受着同样的权利，分得了一份土地，获得了经济的独立。随着斗争的开展，她们不仅要求彻底消灭封建制度，而且更提出了婚姻自主、家庭民主、学习文化、参加政治活动等新的要求。农村妇女在剿匪时积极地参加站岗、带路、送情报、侦察敌情等工作，并协助部队捉拿土匪。武汉市的女工、知识妇女和家庭妇女在解放以来的接收伪工会、拒用银元、八一劳军、订立劳资集体合同、推销公债等工作中都起了很大的作用。该市女工们在组织的教育下，阶级觉悟大为提高，生产积极性大为增加。第一纱厂的女工，克服了“机器旧、原料缺”的困难条件，使纱产量由每日八十台（每台四百磅）增加到一五○台。
    随着妇女们在经济和政治生活中所起的重大作用，妇女们的社会地位也大大提高。如长沙市工人所选举的十四名工会筹备委员中，其中当选的女工就有七名。湖北安陆县长松乡的十个自然村的村长全是由妇女担任。河南省有七个劳动妇女，曾被选出席去年三月在北京召开的全国妇女代表会，获得了广大群众的拥护和爱戴。河南鲁山县也有许多妇女被提拔到县、区、乡各级政权和农会中担任领导工作，其中且有不少已被吸收参加共产党。
