　　苏联人民购买力大增
    莫斯科中央百货公司顾客增达一倍
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电：莫斯科中央百货公司在三月份前二十天内的销售量，生动地证明了物价的减低已大大地增加了苏联人民的购买力。该百货公司经理巴拉赫年科夫说：二月份该公司的顾客每天平均为八万人，而三月份平均增加到十四万至十五万人。每日平均贸易额增加了百分之四十七，某些物品甚至比这还要高。例如该公司在减价前“卡普隆”（苏联的尼隆）袜子每天销售一千零八十三双，而在减价后已增加到二千八百四十七双；减价前皮鞋每天销售一千七百三十双，减价后销售了三千三百九十二双；减价前无线电收音机每天销售十八个，减价后销售了九十六个；手表与怀表减价前每天销售七十五个，减价后销售二百六十三个；减价前缝纫机每天销售十九架，减价后销售八十五架。顾客们的需要不仅是基于他们的爱好和要求，并且也基于苏维埃工业产品品质的优良。
