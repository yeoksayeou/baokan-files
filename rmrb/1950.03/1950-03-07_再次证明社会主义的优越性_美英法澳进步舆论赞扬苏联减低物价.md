Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th. A summary of TASS reports: Progressive public opinion in France, the United States, Britain, and Australia unanimously praised the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on reducing prices and the decision of the Council of Ministers on increasing the ruble exchange rate.

The French Communist Party newspaper, *l'Humanité*, published a speech by Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the French Communist Party, at a mass meeting in Bagnolet, Seine, stating: "This is a brilliant example demonstrating that the Soviet Union is continuously increasing production and improving the living standards of the working masses in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. While the decadent capitalist old world is trapped in heavy contradictions and sees a terrible war as the only way out of these contradictions, the socialist world once again proves its superiority and effectively helps to defend peace."

The American Communist Party newspaper, *The Daily Worker*, in an editorial titled "Socialism Thrives," pointed out the sharp rise in prices in the United States since the abolition of price controls and stated: "The socialist economy is different; it is for human welfare and not for the profits of one percent of the population. In the astonishing socialist victory of the Soviet Union, we can see why the Soviet leaders are so confident in promoting peaceful competition between the two social systems. They are willing to let the people decide on their social system based on the results."

The British Communist Party newspaper, *The Daily Worker*, commented: "These decisions by the Soviet government and the Communist Party prove that the anti-Soviet rumors about the Soviet standard of living are malicious slander. These anti-Soviet elements have to admit that the real wages of Soviet workers have doubled in three years. During the same three years, the real wages of British workers have decreased. The value of the Soviet ruble has increased, while the British pound has depreciated."

The Australian Communist Party organ, *Tribune*, commented: "The devaluation of the pound sterling and many other currencies linked to the pound under American pressure indicates a reduction in the real wages of workers in those countries that the United States is providing so-called economic assistance to. Only in the Soviet Union have post-war prices tended to fall, and now, through greatly increased production, prices have been reduced, greatly increasing real wages and raising the value of the currency."

### 再次证明社会主义的优越性  美英法澳进步舆论赞扬苏联减低物价

　　再次证明社会主义的优越性
    美英法澳进步舆论赞扬苏联减低物价
    【新华社北京六日电】综合塔斯社消息：法、美、英、澳进步舆论，一致赞仰苏联部长会议与苏联共产党关于减低物价和部长会议关于提高卢布兑换率的决定。
    法共人道报刊载法共总书记多列士在赛纳省巴尼欧举行的群众大会上的讲演称：“这是辉煌的例证，说明苏联在不断地增加生产和提高苏联与人民民主国家劳动群众的生活水平。当腐朽的资本主义旧世界陷于重重的矛盾中，并把可怖的战争看成摆脱矛盾的唯一出路之时，社会主义世界再次证明了它的优越性，且有效地帮助了保卫和平。”
    美共工人日报在题为“社会主义欣欣向荣”的社论中指出美国自物价管制取消以来物价的猛烈上涨，并称：“社会主义经济则与此不同，它是为了人类福利而不是为了占人口百分之一的人的利润。在苏联惊人的社会主义胜利中，我们可以看出苏联领袖为什么如此有信心地力促两个社会制度间的和平竞赛。他们愿意让人民根据结果，自己来决择他们的社会制度。”
    英共工人日报评称：“苏联政府和联共党的这些决定，证明了反苏派关于苏联生活水准的谣言，只是恶意的诽谤。这些反苏派不得不承认，苏联工人的实际工资在三年内已增加了一倍。在同样的三年中，英国工人的实际工资却减少了。苏联卢布的价值增高了，英国的英镑却贬值了。”
    澳大利亚共产党机关报论坛报评称：“在美国压力之下，英镑和许多其他与英镑有关的货币的贬值，表示在那些美国正给予所谓经济援助的国家中工人实际工资的减少。只有在苏联，战后物价已趋下降，而现在通过大为增加了的生产，又使物价减低而大大增加了实际工资和提高了货币的价值”。
