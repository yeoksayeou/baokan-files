　　[This Newspaper] reports: Yi Qingyuan, Chief of the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau, and Zhu Yunsheng, Deputy Chief of the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau of the Tianjin Railway Administration, sent a letter to this newspaper on the 9th of this month, reporting on the self-criticism made by the leadership of the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau regarding the "Serious Corruption and Waste Discovered in the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Inspection" revealed by this newspaper on March 4th. The original letter stated:

　　After inspecting the work on the Beijing-Suiyuan Line, our Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau's leadership conducted a self-criticism. The People's Daily's short commentary on March 4th, "Raise Awareness and Discipline," further elevated our ideological level. We have organized all railway employees to study this short commentary from the People's Daily in conjunction with the problems discovered during the inspection. Under the call for a thorough economy drive across the entire Tianjin Railway Administration, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway has deeply unearthed instances of corruption and waste. Since these facts pertain to problems discovered during the January inspection, some have already been overcome and corrected by the time they were published in the People's Daily, while others are in the process of being rectified. Some were discovered by the leading organs, while others were exposed by the employees themselves. However, all the serious phenomena exposed by the thorough inspection serve as an excellent test for the leadership of the sub-bureau. This demonstrates that, both in the past and present, the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau's leadership has seriously suffered from, and continues to suffer from, bureaucracy. Although we have constantly strived to improve, the facts prove that in the past, our inspections of such incidents were inadequate, and our handling was not timely, resulting in the failure to expose many phenomena such as waste and smuggling early enough to educate all employees, causing significant losses to state property. This proves that we lack political acumen and still harbor complacency. Second, we have not yet learned to manage enterprises and still possess a certain degree of "guerrilla habits" that have not been overcome. This thorough inspection has further educated us on how to improve the work on the Beijing-Suiyuan Line. In addition to strengthening education for railway employees, we have decided: First, to strengthen key leadership, consolidate the eastern section, and focus on the western section; to strengthen investigation and research, as well as organization and planning in our work. Second, to improve the inspection system, continue to go deep into the lower levels, and strengthen discipline. Third, to strengthen the leadership of the Management Committee, unite all railway workers and staff, and learn to manage railway enterprises, in order to continuously improve leadership, transform our style, and increase production and transportation, to answer the people's hopes for us.

　　京绥路严重贪污浪费现象
    张家口铁路分局已作检讨
    决加强领导并健全检查制度
    正副分局长致函本报报告
    【本报讯】天津铁路管理局张家口分局分局长易清源、副分局长朱云生本月九日致函本报，报告张家口分局领导上对三月四日本报揭露的“京绥路大检查发现严重贪污浪费”的检讨。原函称：
    我们张家口铁路分局检查了京绥线工作后，领导上曾作了检讨。三月四日人民日报发表“提高觉悟性与纪律性”的短评，把我们的思想水平，更加提高了一步。我们已组织全路员工结合检查中发现的问题学习人民日报的这篇短评。京绥路在天津铁路管理局全路节约大检查的号召下，深入发掘了贪污浪费现象。这些事实，因系一月份检查出来的问题，在人民日报发表时，有些早已克服改正，有些正在纠正。有的是领导机关检查出来的，有的是过去存在现经员工自己揭发出来的。但大检查所暴露的一切严重现象，对于分局的领导，则是一个很好的考验。这说明：不论过去与现在，张家口分局在领导上，都严重的存在过与仍然存在着官僚主义。我们虽不断努力改进，但事实证明，过去对这类事件检查不周，处理不及时，致许多浪费走私等现象未及早揭发以教育全体职工，使国家财产蒙受很大损失。这证明我们在政治上缺乏锐敏性，还存有麻痹现象。第二，还没有学会管理企业，存在着某种程度的“游击习气”未被克服。这次大检查，进一步教育了我们应如何改进京绥线工作。我们除对铁路员工加强教育外，决定：第一，加强重点领导，巩固东段，突击西段；加强调查研究与工作中的组织性，计划性。第二，健全检查制度，继续深入下层，加强纪律性。第三，加强管委会的领导，团结全路工人职员，学会管理铁路企业，以求不断地改进领导，转变作风，提高生产运输，来回答人民对我们的希望。
