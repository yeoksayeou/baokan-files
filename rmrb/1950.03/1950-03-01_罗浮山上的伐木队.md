　　Logging Team on Mount Luofu
　　Guo Erzuo
　　The logging production team, consisting of more than 800 people from a directly subordinate unit of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, arrived in the Mount Luofu area near Zengcheng, Guangdong on January 11th. After properly dividing the logging areas, they officially started logging on the 14th.
　　Mount Luofu is covered with shady trees and ancient towering trees, and very few people have ever gone up the mountain to log. There are various kinds of trees here, the large ones are too big to embrace, and the small ones are also twenty or thirty years thick. The target of the logging team is pine wood.
　　In the morning, as the sun just rose from the east, this strong production team cheerfully poured onto the mountain. In order to increase work efficiency, they made a reasonable division of labor: half of the people were responsible for logging; half of the people cut the branches on the trees, and were also responsible for transporting the wood to the troops' station. Under the encouragement of Chairman Mao's production call, the commanders and fighters were full of production enthusiasm. The sound of logging resounded throughout the mountains and forests. In hard work, although there were not enough houses in the mountains and it was very difficult to eat vegetables, no one complained. The firewood team of the headquarters, a group of eleven cadres, challenged the soldiers: Comrade Wang Jing, who came from the Southern Workers' Troupe, had never done any work before, but now he is working hard, felling fifteen large trees a day, and has been praised by the superiors. The soldiers were afraid of falling behind, and they also challenged each other. Thus, a vigorous production competition was enthusiastically launched in the mountains and forests.
　　The cooking class of the political department's production team has only three cooks. In order to ensure that the comrades on the mountain eat and drink well, after finishing frying dishes and cooking, they also hurried to cook thin porridge and send it to the mountain in shifts. When the comrades of the artillery battalion who stayed at home heard the news that the logging team had worn out their shoes, they immediately launched a shoe donation craze. Many comrades said: "I would rather not wear shoes than let them work barefoot on the mountain!" Comrade Gao Mingxin, a young comrade from the battalion headquarters, donated his only pair of replacement shoes. In one day, the entire battalion donated a total of eighty-two pairs of shoes, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the logging team.
　　Due to the lack of logging knowledge and experience, the initial results were not very great. After everyone carefully studied, absorbed experience from each other, and improved the logging technology, the results gradually increased. For example, the first day, the communications squad of the political department only felled twenty-five trees, but the next day it increased to fifty-seven trees.
　　According to the current logging rate, each food unit (about forty or fifty people) can fell 200,000 catties of wood before the Spring Festival. The thickest of the felled trees are used for making boards, the medium-sized ones are used as timber, and the small ones are used as firewood or for charcoal burning.
　　The logging team on Mount Luofu is working hard. They produced a large amount of wood, which was transported to Guangzhou from waterways and land routes, providing materials for construction projects and also improving the lives of the troops.

　　罗浮山上的伐木队
    郭尔作
    人民解放军第四野战军某部直属队八百余人组成的伐木生产队，一月十一日到达了广东增城附近的罗浮山区，把采伐地区划分妥当，十四日就正式动工伐木了。
    罗浮山上到处林荫蔽日，古树参天，从来很少人上山采伐过。这里有着各种各样的树木，大的一人抱不拢，小的也有二、三十生的粗。伐木队采伐的目标是松木。
    早晨，当太阳刚刚从东方升起的时候，这枝强壮的生产队伍，就愉快地涌上山来。为了增高工作效率，他们进行了合理的分工：一半人专管伐木；一半人砍树上的枝条，同时负责将木料运往部队的驻地。在毛主席生产号召的鼓舞下，指战员们充满着生产的热情。丁丁的伐木声，响遍了整个山林。在辛勤的劳动中，虽然山里房子不够住，吃菜又很困难，却没有一个人叫苦。司令部打柴队，十一个干部编成的一个组，向战士们提出了挑战：由南工团来的王镜同志，从来没干过活，现在也使劲的干，一天伐倒十五棵大树，获得了上级的表扬。战士们唯恐落后，也都互相提出挑战。于是如火如荼的生产竞赛，就在山林中热烈开展起来。
    政治部生产队炊事班只有三个炊事员，为了保证山上同志吃喝得好些，忙完炒菜做饭，还赶着熬稀粥，轮班往山上送。炮兵营留在家里的同志，当听见伐木队把鞋子都磨坏了的消息时，立刻掀起了献鞋热潮。许多同志说：“我宁可不穿鞋，也不能让他们在山上赤脚干活！”营部小同志高明信，把仅有的替换鞋也捐献出来。一天内，全营总共献出八十二双鞋子，大大地鼓励了伐木队的情绪。
    由于缺乏伐木的知识和经验，起初成绩不很大，经过大家细心研究，互相吸收经验，改进了砍伐的技术，成绩便逐渐增加起来。如政治部通讯班第一天只伐倒二十五棵树，第二天就增加到五十七棵。
    照现在伐木的速率，每个伙食单位（约四、五十人）在春节前可伐木二十万斤。所伐的树木最粗的制板片，中型的用作木料，细小的作木柴或烧炭。
    罗浮山上的伐木队在紧张地工作着。他们生产了大批木材，从水路、陆路，源源运到广州，替建筑工程供给了材料，也使部队改善了生活。
