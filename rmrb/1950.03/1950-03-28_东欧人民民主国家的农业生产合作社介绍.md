　　Introduction to Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Eastern European People's Democratic Countries
    Eastern European People's Democratic countries are currently carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture. All People's Democratic countries have established state-owned farms. Poland, which has the largest development scale, has established more than 5,600 state-owned farms, including three types: grain production, seed improvement, and livestock breeding. State-owned farms are socialist enterprises. On the one hand, they supply the country with abundant harvests, and on the other hand, they use their advanced management methods as a demonstration for improving agricultural production.
    In addition to state-owned farms, the most widely adopted measure for agricultural transformation in Eastern European People's Democratic countries is the development of agricultural production cooperatives, organizing individual farmers into cooperative farms. As is well known, the rural areas of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries have rapidly increased by millions of small and medium-sized farmers due to land reform, and they have not yet broken away from conservative and backward management methods. Therefore, various cooperatives that are easier for farmers to understand and accept, such as supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives, were first developed in various countries' rural areas. These cooperatives were quickly welcomed by farmers and widely developed. For example, the Polish Farmers' Mutual Aid League now has 30,000 cooperatives; in Albania, the members of the cooperatives and their families amount to 902,000 people, nearly 90 percent of the total population; and Romania has more than 5,600 consumer cooperatives. Cooperative organizations have educated farmers, and the great achievements of state-owned farms have demonstrated the superiority of socialist agriculture, enabling some middle and small farmers to gradually and voluntarily unite their scattered land and use machinery for joint cultivation.
    In the process of establishing agricultural production cooperatives, the leadership and assistance of the governments and Communist and Workers' Parties of the People's Democratic countries have played a decisive role. They paid attention to helping cooperative farmers consolidate farm management and operation, improve labor discipline, and stipulate the standards for labor days, etc., and led the farmers in fierce struggles with the rich peasants. The government extensively established machine and tractor stations, and helped cooperative farmers with livestock, seeds, and fertilizers. As a result of the operation, the harvest volume of the cooperatives has been greatly increased, generally 25 to 30 percent higher than individual management. This has more powerfully encouraged farmers to participate in joint cultivation. In particular, since last year, the production cooperatives in various countries have been developing rapidly. For example, Poland had only 40 production cooperatives a year ago, but this March it has surged to 698. Bulgaria, which has the most successful operation of cooperatives, now has 1,605 labor cooperative farms. Hungary has established 587 production cooperatives.
    Agricultural production cooperatives in Eastern European People's Democratic countries have many different forms. For example, in Poland and Romania there are land co-cultivation societies, in Poland and Czechoslovakia there are agricultural machinery joint-use cooperatives, and in Hungary there is also a production cooperative with joint cultivation and individual harvesting. Although the management methods of these cooperatives are different, the farmers who participate in the cooperatives still retain their own private ownership of a portion of land. They use the land as "stock" and distribute a portion of the cooperative's income according to the quality and size of the land. For example, most cooperatives in Poland distribute 60 to 70 percent of their income to members according to labor days, 20 to 25 percent according to the quality and quantity of land joined in the cooperative, and 10 to 15 percent according to the value of farm tools and livestock joined in the cooperative. Cooperatives prohibit rich peasants from participating and prohibit employing workers.
    In addition to the above-mentioned various primary forms of agricultural production cooperatives, the People's Democratic countries have also developed and established advanced forms of cooperative farms—collective farms. The United Agricultural Cooperative in Poland belongs to this category. In the farm, land and important production tools are collectively owned. The cooperative sets aside 30 percent of its income as a fixed fund, and the rest is distributed to members only according to labor days. Romania established 56 collective farms from July to September last year, and 47 more this spring. The state exempted the farm from taxes for the first two years, and stipulated that the farm should cooperate with the national economic plan, adopt scientific methods, and improve farmers' technical and cultural levels. The earliest cooperative farm in Albania was established three years ago. The country has now established 58 farms.

　　东欧人民民主国家的农业生产合作社介绍
    东欧各人民民主国家目前正在进行农业的社会主义改造。各人民民主国家都建立了国营农场。发展规模最大的波兰，已建立五千六百多个国营农场，包括谷物生产、种子改良和养育牲畜等三种类型。国营农场是社会主义的企业，它一面以丰富的收获供给国家，一面又以其先进的经营方式，作为改进农业生产的示范。
    除了国营农场之外，目前东欧各人民民主国家在农业改造中最广泛采取的措施，还是发展农业生产合作社，把个体农民组织到合作农场里去。如所周知，东欧人民民主国家的农村，都曾因土地改革而迅速增加了千百万的中小农，他们都还没有脱离保守落后的经营方式。因此，各国在农村中首先发展了各种较易为农民了解和接受的，如供销、消费等合作社。这些合作社迅速受到农民的欢迎并广泛发展起来。例如波兰的农民互助联盟现在已有三万个合作社；阿尔巴尼亚参加合作社的社员连同家属达九十万二千人，将及全人口百分之九十；罗马尼亚有五千六百多个消费合作社。合作社组织教育了农民，加以国营农场的巨大成就所显示的社会主义农业的优越性，使得若干中、小农民渐次自愿把分散的土地联合起来，使用机械进行共同耕作。
    在农业生产合作社的建立过程中，人民民主国家的政府和共产党与工人党的领导与帮助，起了决定性的作用。它们注意帮助了合作农民巩固农场的管理与经营，提高了劳动纪律，规定了劳动日的标准等，并领导农民和富农进行了激烈的斗争。政府广泛建立了机器与拖拉机站，并以牲畜、种籽、肥料等帮助合作社农民。经营的结果，合作社的收获量大大提高，一般都高出个体经营的百分之二十五至三十。这就更有力地鼓励了农民参加共同耕作。特别是从去年以来，各国的生产合作社都在迅速发展。例如波兰在一年以前只有四十个生产合作社，今年三月已激增至六百九十八个。经营合作社最具成绩的保加利亚，现在已有一千六百零五个劳动合作农场。匈牙利已建立了五百八十七个生产合作社。
    东欧人民民主国家的农业生产合作社有多种不同的样式，例如在波兰和罗马尼亚有土地共耕社，在波兰和捷克有农业机械共同使用合作社，在匈牙利还有一种共同耕作、个别收割的生产合作社等等。这些合作社的经营方式虽各各不同，但参加合作社的农民都还保有自己一份土地的私有权。他们以土地作为“股票”，并按土地的质量和大小，分配合作社的一部分收益。例如波兰大多数合作社以其收入的百分之六十至七十按照劳动日分配给社员，百分之二十至二十五按加入合作社的土地的质量和数量分配，百分之十至十五按加入合作社的农具和牲畜的价值分配。合作社禁止富农参加，并且禁止雇工。
    除了上述各种初级形式的农业生产合作社外，人民民主国家也发展建立了高级形式的合作农场——集体农场。波兰的联合农业合作社便属这一类。在农场里，土地和重要生产工具都归公有，合作社以其收入的百分之三十划作固定基金，其余只按劳动日分配给社员。罗马尼亚在去年七月到九月成立了五十六个集体农场，今春又成立了四十七个。国家豁免了农场最初两年的税款，并规定农场要与国民经济计划配合进行工作，采用科学方法，提高农民技术文化水平等。阿尔巴尼亚最早的一个合作农场，成立已届三年。该国现在已建立了五十八个农场。
