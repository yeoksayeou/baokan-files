　　Lucheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shanxi, Seizes the Season
    To Sell Agricultural Tools at Low Prices to Support Spring Plowing
    [Our Dispatch] The Lucheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province is seizing the season to purchase a large number of agricultural tools and insecticides, vigorously cooperating with spring plowing production. The county cooperative began preparations for cooperating with spring plowing production in mid-January. After the village cooperatives under its jurisdiction formulated plans for the agricultural tools needed for spring plowing, the county cooperative signed contracts with the Huangnian Casting Plow Factory, the Tiangong Village Oil Pressing Factory, and the Licheng County Cooperative to order more than 7,000 pieces of agricultural tools of various sizes and more than 15,000 catties of fertilizer. In late February, after the county cooperative attended the Changzhi Special District Party Congress and the Special District Cooperative Conference, it inspected the work of assisting the masses in winter production and decided that this spring's business would focus on strengthening production increase and seedling protection work and preventing natural disasters. It then ordered 30 head of livestock from the Changzhi Special District Cooperative and signed exchange contracts with the Huguan, Lingchuan, Changzhi, and Jincheng county cooperatives to exchange 1,000 plowshares, 3,000 catties of peanut seeds, and 7,000 catties of millet for 4,500 catties of black alum insecticide, 1,000 catties of asphalt, 50 catties of red alum, and more than 600 pieces of agricultural tools such as seed drills and plowshares. In addition, it also proposed a sum of funds to help the iron and wood tool factory rush to manufacture more than 450 pieces of agricultural tools such as stake wood rakes and cart surrounds. Currently, the county cooperative has formulated sales methods for various agricultural tools and insecticides, stipulating that they should be sold at 8% to 10% lower than market prices. It has also notified village cooperatives to sign purchase and sale contracts with it as needed. At the same time, it plans to use the old temple fairs to publicize and exhibit various agricultural tools in a planned way, allowing the masses to purchase freely.
