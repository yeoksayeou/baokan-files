Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th: The China Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a meeting today, and bid farewell to Committee member Xiao San, who is going abroad to attend the Swedish meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. Those present included Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Vice-Chairmen Liu Ningyi and Shen Yanbing, and committee members in Beijing Fan Wenlan, Peng Zemin, Qian Junrui, Xiao San, Chen Jiakang, Ma Xulun, Situ Meitang, Zhu Kezhen, Ma Sicong, Cheng Yanqiu, Ye Qisun, Li Dequan, Shao Lizi, Xu Deheng, and others, totaling dozens of people.

Guo Moruo Speaks: Asks Xiao San to Convey the Chinese People's Determination and Strength in Defending Peace to the World

The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Guo Moruo. He pointed out that since the establishment of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace on October 3rd of last year, we have basically completed the military war on the mainland domestically, and internationally, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been signed. This situation has further strengthened the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. The reactionary face of American imperialism has become increasingly blatant during this period, frantically opposing peace, and today it has even become so arrogant as to refuse representatives of the World Peace Congress to enter the country, and consider the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons as "arrogant." Chairman Guo also pointed out that the madness of American imperialism shows its apparent strength but inner weakness, approaching a crisis. At the same time, due to the existence of this imperialist madness, the work of defending peace is even more urgent today. We Chinese people have unparalleled determination and great strength in this regard. Today, we bid farewell to Representative Xiao San who is going abroad to participate in the Swedish meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, to ask Representative Xiao San to convey the determination and strength of our Chinese people to the world.

Liu Ningyi and Chen Jiakang Report on the General Situation of Peace Movements in China and the World: Point Out That the Peace Camp Has Absolute Confidence of Victory

Subsequently, Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi and Committee member Chen Jiakang gave reports on the general situation of the Chinese people's movement to defend world peace and the world's movement to defend peace. Liu Ningyi pointed out that the Chinese people's movement to defend world peace has become a widespread and in-depth movement throughout the country. All one hundred and forty members of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace have separately participated in the practical work of politics, economy, culture, education, and mass movements in various regions. He also pointed out that the world peace camp already has more than one billion organized people, and we are absolutely confident of winning the victory in the struggle for world peace and democracy. Chen Jiakang reported that the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 was warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world, and the world unanimously believes that this is a decisive event in defending world peace. He also described the great improvement in the living standards of the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries last year, and the rapid expansion of democratic and progressive organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Youth, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the International Union of Students, all of which showed that the world's peace forces had a leap and powerful development in 1949.

At the meeting, Vice-Chairman Shen Yanbing and committee members Ma Xulun, Qian Junrui, Xu Deheng, and Li Dequan expressed warm farewells to Representative Xiao San for going abroad. In his reply, Representative Xiao San said that under the supervision of the people of the whole country and all the committee members, he must carefully and humbly convey the hope and determination of the entire Chinese people to defend world peace to the world.

Finally, the meeting unanimously passed the resolution on the establishment of the committee's organization and the list of candidates for the working committees of each group, and the telegram to the US Congress protesting the unreasonable refusal of representatives of the World Peace Congress to enter the country.

　　我国保卫世界和平大会委员会举行会议
    欢送萧三代表到瑞典去  出席世界和大常委会议
    【新华社北京八日电】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会今日举行会议，并欢送该会委员萧三代表出国出席世界和平大会常设委员会的瑞典会议。到有中国保卫世界和平大会主席郭沫若、副主席刘宁一、沈雁冰及在京委员范文澜、彭泽民、钱俊瑞、萧三、陈家康、马叙伦、司徒美堂、竺可桢、马思聪、程砚秋、叶企孙、李德全、邵力子、许德珩等数十人。
    郭沫若讲话：请萧三把我国人民保卫和平的决心与力量传达到世界去
    大会首先由郭沫若主席讲话。他指出自去年十月三日中国保卫世界和平大会成立以来，在国内我们基本上完成了大陆上的军事战争，在国际间有了中苏友好同盟互助条约的订定。这一形势使以苏联为首的世界和平阵营更为壮大。而美国帝国主义的反动面目在这一期间也越来越露骨，疯狂地反对和平，今天甚至狂妄到了这样的地步：拒绝世界保卫和平大会的代表入国，而认为缩减军备和禁止原子武器为“狂妄”。郭主席又指出，美帝国主义的疯狂，正是显示了它的外强中干，迫近危机。同时，由于帝国主义这种疯狂性的存在，保卫和平的工作在今天就更迫切了。我们中国人民在这方面是有无比的决心和伟大的力量的。我们今天欢送萧三代表出国参加世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的瑞典会议，就是要请萧三代表把我们中国人民的这种决心与力量传达到全世界去。
    刘宁一陈家康报告我国和世界和运概况  指出和平阵营有绝对胜利把握
    接着由刘宁一副主席及陈家康委员分别作了关于中国人民保卫世界和平运动和全世界保卫和平运动概况的报告。刘宁一指出，中国人民的保卫世界和平运动已在全国各地成为一种广泛而深入的运动。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会的一百四十名委员都已经分头参加到政治、经济、文化、教育、群众运动各方面各地区的实际工作中去。他并指出，世界和平阵营已具有十万万以上有组织的人民，我们争取世界和平民主斗争的胜利是绝对有把握的。陈家康报告一九四九年中华人民共和国的成立受到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎，全世界一致认为这是保卫世界和平的有决定意义的事件。他又叙述了去年苏联及人民民主国家人民经济生活水平的大为提高，世界工联、青联、妇联、学联等民主进步组织的迅速扩大，都显示了在一九四九年世界和平力量有了飞跃而强大的发展。
    在会上沈雁冰副主席及马叙伦、钱俊瑞、许德珩、李德全等委员都对萧三代表的出国表示热烈欢送。萧三代表在答词中说：他在全国人民和各委员的督促之下，他一定要谨慎谦虚地把全中国人民保卫世界和平的希望与决心传达到世界去。
    会议最后一致通过了该会的机构设立与各组工作委员会人选名单的决议案和向美国国会抗议无理拒绝世界和平大会代表入境的通电。
