　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, to prevent engineering responsibility accidents during the spring thaw period due to loose subgrades of newly built lines, issued an urgent order to all bureaus on the 27th of last month. The order instructed responsible personnel at all levels in charge of engineering work in each Railway Administration and Sub-bureau to inspect problematic sections and urgent engineering issues along the lines by accompanying trains, starting from March 1st. At the same time, each bureau should review the current speed limits on each line based on line conditions to ensure safe train operation. For sections with loose subgrades, temporary slow-downs should be enforced if immediate reinforcement is not possible. The track patrol system of each work area (i.e., the inspection teams of the new track maintenance method) should be firmly established before the 10th of this month. The chief of the engineering department of each bureau is responsible for checking the implementation of the track patrol system. In addition, the order also specified various specific track maintenance tasks that each bureau should immediately undertake.

    保证春溶时期行车安全  防止发生工务责任事故
    【新华社北京四日电】中央人民政府铁道部为防止春溶时期因新修线路路基松软以致发生工务责任事故，已于上月二十七日对各局发出紧急命令。命令责成各管理局和分局担当工务工作的各级负责人员自三月一日起随车察看各线的不良地段和急须解决的工务问题。同时各局应根据线路情况，对各线现行限制速度加以审查，保证行车安全。对于路基松软地段，如不能立即补强，则规定临时慢行。各工区巡道制度（即新养路法的包检班）应在本月十日以前确实建立起来。巡道制度执行的情况由各局工务处长负责检查。此外，命令还规定了各局应即刻进行的各项具体的养路工作。
