　　American Imperialism Supports Japanese Zaibatsu
    Publicly Declares No Intention to Dismantle Large Japanese Banks
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th] The American occupation authorities in Japan frankly admitted that they want to preserve the rule of Japanese monopoly capital. In a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on the 1st, British Commonwealth representative Hodgson, fearing the adverse effects on Britain of the American support for Japanese Zaibatsu, accused MacArthur of not dissolving the large Japanese banks and revealed that eight Japanese banks control 80% of Japan's industrial and economic life. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Associated Press on the 9th, MacArthur Headquarters has issued a statement openly admitting that MacArthur "has no intention of carrying out drastic reforms to dismantle the large Japanese banks," which means that he has no intention of changing his policy of supporting the rule of Japanese monopoly capital. The statement also retorted to the British representative's accusations, saying that in Britain, eight banks control 80% of Britain's economic life; in Canada, three banks control 75% of Canada's economic life; and in Australia, seven banks control 70% of Australia's economic life.
