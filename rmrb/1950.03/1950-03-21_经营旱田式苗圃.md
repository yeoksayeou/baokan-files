Operating Dryland Nurseries
    Wang Lin, Xu Chengwen
    Forestry construction and development work mainly involves two aspects: one is to manage existing forests, rationally harvest, and utilize them; the other is to plant trees to eliminate barren mountains and wasteland, in order to achieve wind and sand prevention and soil and water conservation. In mountainous and barren areas, planting through sowing is the main method. Along riverbanks, dikes, beaches, sandy wastelands, northwest grasslands, and some mountainous areas, we must vigorously organize and mobilize the masses to plant trees. However, the cultivation and supply of saplings must be resolved in advance; otherwise, it will be a case of achieving half the result with twice the effort, or laboring in vain. In the past, tree planting in Chahar used saplings transported from Zhangjiakou, which not only incurred huge transportation costs, but also resulted in the saplings drying out and dying. Therefore, we must first build nurseries and cultivate a large number of high-quality saplings to meet the needs. However, past nurseries had many shortcomings. We must, based on the current objective conditions of manpower and resources, operate "dryland" nurseries to produce a large number of excellent saplings for afforestation. The operating method of this type of nursery is: find a place of appropriate size near the afforestation area, regardless of whether it is flat land, mountain land, or sandy, alkaline, or barren land, and cultivate and harrow it. Do not create ridges. If water is convenient, it can be watered in advance. Use strip sowing methods, like planting crops, to sow the seeds in the nursery, but not too densely. The soil cover should be four to five times the size of the seeds. Too deep or too shallow is not suitable. In order for the seedlings to emerge easily, do not compact the soil cover. Weed two or three times in summer. Autumn is the best time for sowing, because the ice and snow seal the ground, and the seeds can be protected from birds and animals. After the winter cold stimulation underground, the seedlings will germinate better than those sown in spring. Sowing in early spring and before the rainy season is also possible. Propagation by cuttings is also best in autumn. For general afforestation saplings, transplanting is not necessary. For example, locust and Amorpha fruticosa can be planted in the autumn of the same year or the spring of the following year. Because these one-year-old small saplings are easy to lift and transport, and afforestation is simple, nursery land and a large amount of operating expenses can be saved. Moreover, their branches and trunks are small, there is less damage when lifting saplings, and they do not require much water after planting, so the survival rate is also high. When planting trees, plant two seedlings in each hole. If half of them survive, all of them will have surviving seedlings. Conversely, if large saplings are used, it is difficult to lift them, transporting them is labor-intensive, there is more root damage, the wounds are larger, they require more water, and the crowns are tall and easily swayed by the wind, making it difficult for them to survive. However, this does not apply to experimental nurseries and saplings used for roadside trees.
    The seeds required for operating dryland nurseries should preferably be native tree species. In North and Northwest China, the main ones are poplar, willow, Ailanthus altissima, elm, locust, ash, Melia azedarach, Robinia pseudoacacia, oriental arborvitae, Pinus tabuliformis, Pyrus betulifolia, and Lespedeza bicolor. Each person can manage about ten acres of this type of nursery.
    In 1950, the national plan was to build 32,000 mu of nurseries. If all places take dryland nurseries as the direction, the area can be increased by more than doubled, or more than half of the manpower can be saved, and a large amount of funding can be saved. Now we put forward the dryland extensive nursery for reference in various places, and we hope that forestry workers will provide more opinions.

　　经营旱田式苗圃
    王林·许成文
    林业建设与发展工作主要分两方面：一为整理与管理已有森林及合理采伐利用，一为造林消灭荒山荒地，以达防风防沙及保持水土之效。在山荒地区以播种造林为主，在河岸、堤滩、沙荒地、西北草原及部分山地，须大力组织群众发动群众进行植树造林。但树苗的培养与供给，须事先解决，否则事倍功半，或徒劳无功。以前察北植树，苗木由张家口运往，不仅运费浩大，且苗木风干，悉数死去。为此必须先营建苗圃，培育大量苗木，以供需用。但以往苗圃缺点很多，我们必须根据现今人力物力的客观条件，经营“旱田式”苗圃，以生产大量优良苗木，供应造林。这种苗圃的经营方法是：在接近造林地区，不论平地、山地或沙、碱、荒地，找一块大小适当的地方，加以耕耙，不作畦，水源方便，可事先浇水，用条播方法，像种庄稼一样将种子种到圃里，但不可过密。覆土以种粒大小的四至五倍为度，过深过浅均不适宜，为了子芽容易出土，覆土万勿踏实。夏季除草两三次。下种时节，以秋季为最好，因为冰雪封地，种子可免鸟兽啄食，在地下经过冬季寒冷刺激，翌年发芽比春季播种者好。早春及雨季前下种亦可，插条养苗亦以秋季为佳，用作一般造林苗木，不须移植。如洋槐、紫穗槐等，当年秋季或翌年春季，即可出圃造林。因这种一年生小苗，起苗搬运省工，造林简易，可节省苗圃地与大量经营费。且其枝干小，起苗时伤害少，栽植后需要水分不多，成活亦大。造林时每穴栽双株，若成活一半，全部即可有成活苗株。反之，若用大苗，则起苗难，搬运费工，伤根多，伤口大，需水多，树冠高大，易被风摇，不易成活。但试验苗圃与供行道树用之苗木，不在此限。
    经营旱田式苗圃所需种子，以当地原有树种为佳。在华北与西北地区，主要为杨、柳、椿、榆、槐、白腊、苦楝、洋槐、侧柏、油松、杜梨、胡枝子等。这种苗圃，每人可经营十亩左右。
    一九五○年全国计划营建苗圃三二、○○○亩，如果各处均以旱田式苗圃为方向，则可增大一倍以上的面积，或节省一半以上的人力，并可节省大批经费。现提出旱田式粗放苗圃，资各地参考，更希林业工作者多多提供意见。
