Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Telegram: Soviet newspapers published articles commemorating the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Economic and Cultural Cooperation.

　　　　Established a modern national industry and mechanized transportation industry
　　Razgovorov wrote in Izvestia on February 28: The friendship between Mongolia and the great socialist country and the frequent and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union play a huge and decisive role in the achievements of the Mongolian people. Thanks to Soviet economic assistance, the Mongolian People's Republic has established a national industry equipped with modern technology and a mechanized transportation industry. Now, Mongolia has a number of large enterprises, such as the Ulan Bator Industrial Complex and meat packing plant, the Nalaikh coal mine, and the machine-building factory. These large enterprises are the pride of the Mongolian people. The New Ulan Bator Railway, newly built with Soviet assistance, opened to traffic last year. Mongolia's main economic sectors, animal husbandry and agriculture, are systematically using the latest achievements of Soviet agricultural biology to improve the productivity of livestock products and create abundant feed sources. From 1940 to 1948 alone, the amount of livestock products available for sale on the market doubled.

　　The Mongolian People's Republic's Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Cultural Development (from 1948 to 1952), adopted in 1947, has further advanced the number of livestock and their productivity. In 1950, 5 million to 6 million hectares of arid desert will be irrigated. This measure creates new and enormous possibilities for the further development of animal husbandry.

　　　　A real reform has been carried out in culture, and education has developed rapidly.
　　With the consolidation of the independent economic foundation of the Mongolian People's Republic, a real reform has also been carried out in culture. Mongolia had a large number of illiterates before the revolution, but now it has 412 schools providing comprehensive education, 14 technical schools, three higher education institutions, as well as eight national newspapers, 19 local newspapers, and 14 magazines. In addition, there are 640 clubs and entertainment venues, 72 libraries, 63 cinemas, and mobile film projection teams.

　　　　The Soviet Union has always unswervingly defended Mongolia's right to participate in the United Nations.
　　On the international stage, the Soviet Union has always unswervingly defended the right of the Mongolian People's Republic to participate in the United Nations, and has repeatedly exposed the attempts of American and British imperialists to use this organization to achieve their goals of interfering in Mongolia's internal affairs. The friendship between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union has strengthened Mongolia's international status. Thanks to the victory of the Chinese people and the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic now has China as a friendly neighbor. In the joint statement of the Soviet and Chinese governments, the independence of the Mongolian people was reaffirmed.

　　The Soviet-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, like other treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, is conducive to the cause of peace and international security. This treaty is an obstacle to preventing new ambitious people who attempt to dominate the world from realizing their cunning conspiracies.

　　The further consolidation of Soviet-Mongolian friendship is a reliable guarantee for the Mongolian People's Republic to advance victoriously along the road of socialist construction.

　　在苏联经常而无私的帮助下
    蒙古经济文化建设成就巨大
    苏联各报撰文纪念苏蒙缔约四周年
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科电：苏联报纸撰文纪念苏蒙友好互助条约和经济与文化合作协定缔结的四周年。
            建立了现代化的民族工业和机械化的运输业
    拉兹哥伏洛夫于二月廿八日在消息报上写道：蒙古与伟大的社会主义国家之间的友谊及苏联的经常而无私的帮助，在蒙古人民的成就中，起着巨大而有决定性的作用。由于苏联的经济援助，蒙古人民共和国建立了以近代化技术装备的民族工业，并建立了机械化的运输业。现在，蒙古已有了若干大企业，诸如乌兰巴托尔的工业联合企业和肉类包装工厂、纳拉伊哈的煤矿及机器制造厂等。这些大的企业就是蒙古人民的骄傲。在苏联的帮助下新建筑的新乌兰巴托尔铁路，已于去年通车。蒙古的主要经济部门畜牧业以及农业，正在采用苏联农业生物学的最新成就，进行着有系统的运动，以提高畜牧业产物的生产率，并创造丰足的饲料来源。仅在一九四○年到一九四八年间，可供市场出售的牲畜产品，就增加了一倍。
    一九四七年所通过的蒙古人民共和国国民经济与文化发展的五年计划（自一九四八年至一九五二年），使牲畜的头数及其生产率又向前进了一步。一九五○年将要灌溉五百万到六百万公顷干涸的沙漠。这一举措为进一步发展畜牧业创造新的巨大的可能性。
            文化进行了真正的改革，教育事业突飞猛晋。
    随着蒙古人民共和国独立的经济基础的巩固，在文化方面也进行了真正的改革。蒙古在革命前文盲众多，而现在，却有着四百十二所进行全面教育的学校、十四所技术学校、三所高等教育机关，以及八种全国性的报纸、十九种地方性报纸和十四种杂志。另外，还有六百四十处俱乐部和娱乐场所、七十二处图书馆、六十三家电影院和流动电影放映队。
            苏联始终不渝维护蒙古参加联合国的权利
    在国际舞台上，苏联始终不渝地维护着蒙古人民共和国参加联合国的权利，并在联合国各机构中屡次揭露美英帝国主义者企图利用这一机构来达到其干涉蒙古内政的目的。蒙古人民共和国和苏联的友谊，已强固了蒙古的国际地位。由于中国人民的胜利和中华人民共和国的宣告成立，蒙古人民共和国现在已有了中国这个友好的邻邦。在苏中两国政府的联合声明中，蒙古人民的独立重新得到了保证。
    苏蒙友好互助条约，就像苏联和其他人民民主国家缔结的其他条约一样，有利于和平与国际安全事业。这一条约是阻止妄图称霸世界的新野心家实现其狡猾阴谋的一个障碍。
    苏蒙友谊的进一步巩固，乃是蒙古人民共和国胜利地沿着社会主义建设的道路前进的可靠保证。
