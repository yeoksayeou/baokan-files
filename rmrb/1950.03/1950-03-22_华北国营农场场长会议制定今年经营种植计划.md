Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened the first North China State Farm Directors' Meeting from February 22nd to 26th. Participants included the heads of the Beijing Suburbs and Bohai Reclamation Bureaus, the directors of state farms in North China, and cadres from the Ministry of Agriculture, totaling over 30 people. The meeting summarized the work of state farms in North China in 1949 and formulated the management and planting plans for each farm this year. In 1949, there were eight state farms in North China: Shuangqiao, Fengtai, Nanyuan, Huangcun, Jiheng, Boai, Chabei, and Huanghua, with a total cultivated area of over 92,000 mu and 70 tractors. These state farms played a significant demonstration role in the development of agricultural production in various regions last year. The meeting decided that, in addition to building new farms in Gaoli (Bohai area), Baoding, Guangrao (Shandong), Suiyuan, and the Yellow River flooded area this year, no more new farms should be built in other areas. The basic tasks of each state farm this year are to learn business management and cultivate cadres. In terms of business management, the meeting decided to implement scientific management methods, organize production rationally, implement an economic accounting system to reduce costs and increase yields; and establish a farm management committee and hold regular farm affairs meetings. The existing organizational structure of the farm should be simplified to establish a reasonable management organization focused on the farming team. In terms of planting, the meeting decided that planting plans should be formulated according to the objective conditions of each farm's soil quality, environment, etc., to determine its development direction. For example, Chabei Farm should focus on developing animal husbandry, Gaoli Farm should plant more rice, and other farms should plant more wheat, cotton, and coarse grains. In order to improve soil quality, each farm should implement a crop rotation system. In addition, the meeting decided that Gaoli Farm should be a key demonstration farm in North China because it has electric water lifting equipment and other mechanical equipment.

　　华北国营农场场长会议制定今年经营种植计划
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府农业部于二月二十二日至二十六日召开了华北区第一次国营农场场长会议。参加者有京郊、渤海两农垦管理局负责人、华北区各国营农场场长及农业部干部等共三十余人。会议总结了一九四九年华北区各国营农场的工作，并制定了今年各农场的经营和种植计划。一九四九年华北区共有双桥、丰台、南苑、黄村、冀衡、博爱、察北、黄骅等八个国营农场，耕地面积共九万二千余亩，拖拉机七十部。这些国营农场对去年各地农业生产的发展起了相当大的示范作用。会议决定今年除在高里（渤海区）、保定、广饶（山东）、绥远、黄泛区等地增建农场外，其他地区不再多建新场。各国营农场今年的基本任务是学会经营管理和培养干部。在经营管理方面，会议决定实行科学的管理方法，合理地组织生产，实行经济核算制，以减低成本，提高产量；同时建立农场管理委员会和经常召开场务会议。农场现有的组织机构应实行简化，建立以耕作队为重心的合理的经营机构。在种植方面，会议决定：应根据各农场土质、环境等客观条件，制定种植计划，决定其发展方向。如察北农场应以发展畜牧为主，高里农场应多种水稻，其他各场多种麦棉杂粮。为改良土质，各场均应实行作物轮作制。此外，会议决定高里农场因有电力扬水设备和其他机械设备，应为华北的重点示范农场。
