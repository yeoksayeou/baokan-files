　　Beijing Municipal News Office Correction
    The phrase "Qi Shouyao (Court Judge)" in the news "Municipal Government Pays Attention to Corruption, Embezzlement, and Dereliction of Duty Cases" issued by this office yesterday was a mistake, and should have read "Qi Shouyao (Court Trainee Judge)." We hereby correct it.
    Also, in the same news item and in the news item "Four Corrupt Officials Dismissed and Disciplined," "Wang Chong" was a mistake for "Wang Zhong." This is corrected as well.
        (Both published on page one of this newspaper on March 30th)

    本处昨日所发“市府注意贪污腐化渎职案件”新闻内“齐寿曜（法院审判员）”为“齐寿曜（法院学习审判员）”之误，特此更正。
    又，该项新闻及“四贪污腐化人员被撤职处分”新闻中“王冲”误为“王仲”，一并更正。
