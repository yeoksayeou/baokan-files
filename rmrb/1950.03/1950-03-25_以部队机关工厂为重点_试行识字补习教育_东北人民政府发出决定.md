　　Focusing on Military Units, Government Agencies, and Factories
    Pilot Literacy Supplementary Education
    Decision Issued by the Northeast People's Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] The Northeast People's Government, in light of the completed land reform in the Northeast region, the commencement of production and construction, and the masses' enthusiastic demand for higher cultural levels, has decided to systematically carry out mass literacy campaigns and after-school supplementary education, and has issued a decision on piloting literacy campaigns and after-school supplementary education for this purpose.

    The decision stipulates that, starting in 1950, the Northeast will focus on piloting literacy education to gain experience, in order to gradually promote literacy campaigns and eliminate illiteracy in the future. The focus will be on the military, government agencies, and factories; in rural areas, only a few villages and settlements with better harvests, a good foundation in winter schools, and strong leadership should be selected for pilot programs. The target audience will mainly be workers, peasants, and soldiers between the ages of fifteen and forty.

    The decision determines that the literacy campaign should focus on literacy and cultural learning, with the standard generally set at recognizing 1,000 commonly used characters. Textbooks should emphasize the implementation of ideological and political education, and the issue of teachers must follow the mass line, implementing the method of "people teaching people." The organizational form of the literacy campaign should be adapted to local conditions, based on the masses' production, living conditions, and requirements. Study time must utilize production downtime, while the military should use spare time from training and production. For cadres, soldiers, and workers and peasants who already know around 1,000 characters, the decision stipulates that after-school supplementary schools should be established for them, divided into primary and secondary school classes according to their level, and gradually transformed into specialized worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools. Regarding the funding of the literacy campaign, the decision stipulates that the cost of training teachers will be covered by the overall education budget, while the cost of kerosene, chalk, and other expenses will be borne by the masses. The cost of factory literacy campaigns will be covered by the factory's cultural and educational expenses. The funding for after-school supplementary schools will be the responsibility of the military, government agencies, and education administrative departments.

    试行识字补习教育
    东北人民政府发出决定
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】东北人民政府根据东北地区已经完成土地改革，着手生产建设，群众热烈要求提高文化水平的情况，决定有准备有步骤地开展群众识字运动与业余补习教育，并为此发布关于试行开展识字运动及业余补习教育的决定。
    决定规定，东北自一九五零年起，有重点地试行开展识字教育，取得经验，以便将来逐步推广识字运动，扫除文盲。重点放在部队、机关、工厂；在农村里只宜选择若干收成较好、有良好冬学基础而又有较强领导的村屯为试点。对象以十五岁到四十岁的工农兵为主。
    决定确定识字运动以识字、学习文化为内容，其标准一般定为识一千个常用字，在课本中注意贯彻思想政治教育，教员问题必须走群众路线，实行“以民教民”的办法。识字运动的组织形式，应因地制宜，根据群众的生产、生活条件和要求来决定。学习时间必须利用生产空闲来进行，部队里则利用操练和生产的余暇来进行。对于已经识到千字左右的干部、士兵及工农群众，决定规定应为他们另办业余补习学校，按程度分为小学班和中学班，逐步转成专设的工农速成中学。对于识字运动的经费问题，决定规定：训练教员的费用，在总的教育经费中开支，灯油、粉笔等费用开支则由群众解决。工厂识字运动费用，由工厂的文教费用开支。业余补习学校的经费，则由部队、机关及教育行政部门负责。
