[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Dazhong, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Student Union, delivered reports at the Second Beijing Municipal Student Congress on the afternoon of the 18th.

In his report on learning issues, Zhang Dazhong first stated: The main achievement of student work last semester was laying the foundation for learning, with students studying diligently on their own.

Secondly, due to the victorious development of the situation and the establishment and strengthening of political education, students have made great progress in their ideology and politics. At the same time, teachers have also made some improvements in teaching methods and have begun to pay attention to students' welfare.

The main task in the future is to unite teachers and students under administrative leadership and learn regular courses well, including political courses.

Zhang Dazhong pointed out: The central content of New Democratic learning is to learn regular courses well. Other activities such as extracurricular production, cultural and sports activities, and social services are also for the purpose of improving learning. The purpose of learning is to cultivate oneself into useful talents for the construction of the New Democratic state. Regular courses refer to the courses prescribed by the school, including political courses. Political courses should not be placed in opposition to cultural courses. In the situation where the whole country is about to be completely liberated and the construction of the country is about to be launched on a large scale, students' demands for learning are very urgent. However, on the other hand, the old educational system and curriculum cannot be fundamentally reformed in time. In this situation, we should learn honestly and critically. Not only should we learn the courses that have been reformed, but we should also learn other courses that have not yet been fundamentally transformed with a critical attitude. Reforming the curriculum and the educational system is a long-term task and can only be realized gradually. Impatience and rashness are inappropriate. Moreover, the main force for reform is educational administration. Relying solely on students is not enough. However, students can reflect their opinions and assist the government in carrying out the work.

Regarding the issue of teacher-student unity, he said: The vast majority of teachers are eager to make progress, and students should respect them and jointly carry out New Democratic learning. As for individual teachers who oppose the truth and poison young people, of course, we cannot blindly respect them.

It is appropriate to make suggestions to teachers, but it should be done after research and consideration, and with a humble and sincere attitude.

Learning assistance must be based on self-study and teacher guidance, and adopted on a voluntary basis.

When talking about the issue of learning assistance, Zhang Dazhong said: The main difference between the new and old educational methods does not lie in whether it is "collective" learning, holding group meetings all day long; individual hard work and learning regular courses well is also not "individualism." Learning assistance must be based on self-study and teacher guidance, and adopted on a voluntary basis. Only by learning well oneself can one help others.

He said: The principles of learning organizations should be conscious, voluntary, and have working content. A certain organization can only play a certain role. The currently existing overly collectivized learning methods and compulsory organizational forms should be gradually reformed under leadership, and learning organizations should be developed according to the needs of various courses, organized under the principle of voluntariness.

Finally, Zhang Dazhong encouraged the students to cultivate themselves into builders and masters of the new China, and put forward the following four directions for effort: (1) Morality: have revolutionary morality – love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property; (2) Intellect: learn production knowledge and class struggle knowledge; (3) Physique: have a healthy body; (4) Group: learn from the working people and serve the working people.

　　京市二届学代会上
    团北京工委副书记张大中
    关于学习问题报告
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团北京市工作委员会副书记张大中及北京市学生联合会主席古奇踪十八日下午在京市学生二届代表大会上分别作了报告。
    张大中在学习问题的报告中首先说：上学期学生工作的主要成绩是打下了学习的基础，同学们自己认真地进行学习。
    其次，由于形势的胜利发展及政治教育的建立与加强，同学们在思想上、政治上有了很大的进步。同时，教师们在教学方法上也有了一些改进；并开始注意同学们的生活福利。
  今后主要任务是要在行政领导下，师生团结，学好包括政治课在
        内的正课。
    今后同学们的主要任务是在行政领导下，师生团结，学好正课。
    张大中指出：新民主主义的学习的中心内容是学好正课，其他的如课余生产，文娱体育，社会服务等活动也是为了把学习搞好。学习的目的，则是为了把自己培养成为新民主主义国家建设中的有用人材。正课是指学校所规定的课程，包括政治课在内。不应把政治课与文化课对立起来。在全国即将全部解放、国家建设工作即将大规模展开的形势下，同学们学习要求很迫切；但另一方面，旧的学制、课程还来不及根本改革。在这种情况下，我们应该老老实实地、批判地学习。不但已经改革的课程要学，就是其他尚来不及根本改造的课程也要以批判的态度来学习。改革课程、学制是一件长期的工作，只能逐步实现。急躁和草率都是不妥当的。并且，改革工作的主要力量是教育行政。单纯依靠学生是不行的。但同学们可以反映自己的意见，协助政府进行。
    关于师生团结的问题，他说：最大多数的教师都是要求进步的，同学们应尊重他们，共同开展新民主主义的学习。至于如有个别教师反对真理，毒害青年，那当然就不能盲目地去尊敬他们。
    向教师提意见是应当的，但要经过研究考虑，并采取虚心和诚恳的态度。
  学习互助必须建立在自学和教师指导的基础上，采取自愿方式。
    张大中谈到学习互助的问题时说：新旧教育方法的区别主要的不在于是否“集体”学习，整天开小组会；个人努力钻研，学好正课，也不就是“个人主义”。学习互助必须建立在自学和教师指导的基础上，采取自愿的方式。只有自己学好，才能帮助别人。
    他说：学习组织的原则应该是自觉自愿的和有工作内容的。一定的组织，只能起一定的作用。目前存在的过分集体化的学习方法与带有强迫性的组织形式，应该有领导地逐步加以改革，发展根据各种课程的需要，在自愿原则下组织起来的学习组织。
    最后，张大中勉励同学们培养自己成为新中国的建设者和主人翁，并提出下列四个努力方向：（一）德：有革命的道德——爱祖国，爱人民，爱劳动，爱科学，爱护公共财物；（二）智：学习生产知识与阶级斗争知识；（三）体：有健康的身体；（四）群：向劳动人民学习，为劳动人民服务。
