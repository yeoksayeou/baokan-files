　　Spittle Cannot Change the Truth
    Ma Fanto
    “...Moscow's stores from early morning,
     Customers crowded like the eve of a big holiday.
     People across the country are jubilant,
     Celebrating the third post-war price reduction...”
     To the "New York Times," "US officials,"
     This news is more terrifying than the plague!
     "What to do? My God!"
　
     Hurry to lie, intensify the rumors—
     This one says, "Clearly fabricated!"
     That one says, "Purely propaganda!"
     Some insist, "Just playing with numbers."
     Some are self-comforting: "Just a change in bookkeeping."
     Some are still coy: "Considerable doubt here about this measure."
     There is also one called "avoiding direct comment": "Purely theoretical, artificial..."
     There are also big officials who can't sing in harmony,
     Slapping each other with crisp slaps.
     Acheson says the benefits of price reduction and ruble appreciation "tend to be offset,"
     Snyder says, "Have already been offset!"
　
     Competing with each other in the skills of deceiving the people,
     Whistling through the graveyard at night, to bolster their courage.
     But spittle, tears, Goebbels' logic...
     Everything cannot change the truth,
     This is the stark contrast:
     In the Soviet Union—prices are reduced, and national income is greatly increased,
     In the United States—prices rise, and national income declines rapidly;
     In the Soviet Union—workers live more abundantly and happily,
     In the United States—fifteen million unemployed workers;
     In the Soviet Union—the government and the Party give the people endless benefits, fatherly care,
     In the United States—greedy rulers give the people cold war, arms expansion, poverty, and hunger...
　
     People all over the world are excited to hear this good news,
     Only the warmongers in Washington are disappointed and hate it!
     Goering and Himmler would pick up their guns upon hearing of culture and democracy,
     Truman and Acheson lose their courage upon hearing of peace and prosperity!

　　唾沫改变不了真相
    马凡陀
    “……莫斯科各商店从清早起，
     顾客像大节日前夜一样拥挤。
     全国各地人民兴高采烈，
     庆祝战后第三次的物价减低……”
     对《纽约时报》、“美官方人士”说来，
     这消息比瘟疫还要可怕！
     “怎么对付哟？我的上帝！”
　
     赶快撒谎，加紧造谣——
     这个说，“显然是虚构！”
     那个道，“完全是宣传！”
     有的硬说，“只不过是玩弄数字。”
     有的在自我安慰：“仅是记帐上的改变。”
     有的还扭扭捏捏：“此间对此措施颇为怀疑。”
     还有一种叫做“避免作直接评论”：“纯粹是理论上的，人为的……”
     还有大官儿们唱不成双簧，
     彼此打着清脆的耳光。
     艾奇逊说，减价和卢布增值的利益“有抵销之势”，
     施奈德说，“已经抵销了！”
　
     互相竞赛欺骗人民的技俩，
     夜行坟场吹口哨，壮壮自己的胆。
     但唾沫、眼泪、戈倍尔的逻辑术……
     一切都改变不了真相，
     这就是鲜明的对比：
     在苏联——物价减低，国民收入大大增加，
     在美国——物价上涨，国民收入迅速下降；
     在苏联——工人生活得更丰裕，更美满，
     在美国——失业工人一千五百万；
     在苏联——政府和党给人民的是无穷的福利，慈父般的关怀，
     在美国——贪欲无餍的统治者给人民的是冷战、扩充军备、贫穷和饥饿……
　
     全世界人民听到这好消息都兴奋，
     只有华盛顿的战争贩子失望痛恨！
     戈林、希姆莱一听见文化、民主就端起手枪，
     杜鲁门、艾奇逊一听见和平繁荣就失胆丧魂！
