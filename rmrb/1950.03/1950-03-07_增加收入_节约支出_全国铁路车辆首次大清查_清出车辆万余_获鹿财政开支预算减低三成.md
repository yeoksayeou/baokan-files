    First Nationwide Railway Car Inventory
    More Than 10,000 Cars Found; Huolu County Reduces Financial Expenditure Budget by 30%
    Of the cars found, 2,720 can be immediately put into production, potentially increasing national income by the equivalent of over 775,000 catties of millet per day. The majority of the damaged cars can be repaired and used, significantly increasing income and saving expenses for the country.

    [Special Dispatch] The first nationwide railway car inventory was successfully completed within five hours, from 9:00 to 14:00 on February 5th. The inventory revealed 10,117 more cars than originally estimated by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. This represents more than one-fifth of the Ministry's original estimate. Among them, 2,720 cars can be immediately put into operation, increasing the number of turnaround cars by 731.18 per day; estimating the daily income value of each turnaround car at 1,061 catties of millet, this could increase national income by the equivalent of over 775,000 catties of millet per day. The remaining damaged cars can mostly be repaired or combined for repair; this will greatly increase national financial income and save on the expense of manufacturing new cars (these figures have not yet been statistically compiled). In addition, this inspection allowed the Ministry of Railways to understand, for the first time, the detailed number of each type of car nationwide (e.g., in terms of tonnage, how many of each type are there, from 5 tons to 90 tons in fifteen categories; in terms of axles, how many of each type are there, from two axles to seven axles in six categories). This lays the foundation for the Ministry of Railways to accurately manage the nationwide use of cars, precisely calculate turnover rates, and gradually achieve planned transportation and precise maintenance work in the future.

    The Ministry of Railways conducted thorough ideological mobilization and meticulous preparations before this inspection. The preparation work began on January 10th and lasted for twenty days. On January 12th, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan personally presided over a meeting of representatives from various railway bureaus responsible for car inventory. At the meeting, in addition to ideological mobilization and the determination of specific organizational methods, technical regulations, and reporting formats, a field test was conducted at Fengtai Station, establishing a standard inspection time of three minutes and eighteen seconds per car. Subsequently, through ideological mobilization by the railway administration, the Communist Party branches within the railway system, and the railway trade union, everyone's understanding of cherishing national resources and the need to complete the arduous transportation and front-line support tasks of 1950 was enhanced. The Ministry of Railways also instructed the heads of various railway bureaus, sections, and stations to personally lead this work. To carry out this work, inspection committees and inspection teams were established at all levels, from the Ministry of Railways down to the sections and stations. The Tianjin Bureau alone organized more than 220 inspection teams, with the participation of over 600 cadres. The Ministry of Railways dispatched 36 cadres to various locations to supervise the work. Many Soviet experts personally went to the field to provide guidance.

    Huolu County Government, finding its expenditure budget too large, re-examined it, made careful calculations, prioritized urgent matters, eliminated waste, and reduced the budget figure by nearly one-third.

    [Special Dispatch] Our newspaper's special correspondent in Huolu, Hou Yong, reports: The Huolu County Government's Local Finance Committee implemented a policy of living within its means and making careful calculations, reducing the financial expenditure budget by 30%.

    The local financial budget of Huolu County, Hebei, was discussed twice. The first time, due to a lack of sufficient ideological mobilization, all departments assumed that because the local grain levy this year was high, all undertakings could be revitalized, resulting in very large budgets. Although the auditing agencies studied and reduced a portion, the various items were not carefully examined. For example, regarding education expenses, last year teachers' salaries averaged 110 catties of grain per month, while this year's actual expenditure, according to the special commissioner's office, increased to an average of 165 catties per month, yet the budget was set at 200 catties per month. There were many other similar situations, resulting in the budget exceeding the levied grain amount by 270,000 catties. Although this budget had not yet been approved by higher authorities, its sheer size demonstrated a tendency towards waste. After discovering this problem, the county government decided to re-examine the financial budget. Before the review, the spirit of living within its means and various forms of waste were communicated to the responsible cadres of each department, proposing slogans such as "budgets should be realistic" and "make careful calculations and eliminate waste." First, discussions were held among leading cadres to achieve ideological consensus, and then the second Local Finance Committee meeting was convened to re-examine the budget based on the aforementioned spirit. Overlapping and unnecessary expenses and parts that could be postponed were all cancelled. For example, the river management fee originally budgeted for 190,000 catties of grain; however, as this budgetary expense should be planned uniformly by the special commissioner's office, it was completely cancelled. Village-level primary schools are, in fact, funded by the villages themselves, but the education budget included 200,000 catties of rice for the construction of village-level primary schools, which was also cancelled after review. The construction of the Martyrs' Pagoda can be postponed due to the current difficulties in the people's lives. After discussion, this budget item was also completely cancelled. Secondly, some production enterprises can gradually become self-sufficient under the principle of enterprise-based management. For example, the farm nursery originally budgeted for 140,000 catties of rice, but after careful calculations, only 60,000 catties were needed. After review, the entire Huolu budget was reduced by 1,160,000 catties of rice, with the new budget accounting for only 70% of the original budget, and the allocation was also more reasonable. Everyone felt satisfied. In addition, the county's Finance Committee also decided to strengthen the collection of public property rent in Chengguan and to clear up past local financial accounts to strengthen local construction. Currently, over 6,000 catties of rice have been collected from public property rent, and other measures to improve finance are also underway. (Editor's note: This news item written by Comrade Hou Yong was sent in January and contains very insightful policy perspectives. To coincide with the February financial meeting, we have kept it until now to publish it. The shortcoming of this article is that it does not specify the date of the county's Finance Committee meeting.)

　　增加收入·节约支出
    全国铁路车辆首次大清查     
    清出车辆万余  获鹿财政开支预算减低三成
    清出的车辆中，二千七百廿辆即可投入生产，每日可为国家增加收入值小米七十七万五千余斤。破损的大部可以修补使用。可增加大批收入、节省大批开支。                            
    【本报特讯】全国铁路首次车辆大清查工作，于二月五日九时到十四时五小时内胜利完成。清查结果各地较中央人民政府铁道部原统计的车辆共多出一万零一百十七辆。占铁道部原统计车辆总数五分之一强。其中立刻能够投入生产者即达二千七百二十辆，每日可增加周转车数七三一点一八辆；每个周转车每日收入价值以小米一○六一斤估计，每日即可为国家增加收入小米七十七万五千余斤。其余破损车辆，大部分可以修补或合并修造使用；这一方面可为国家增加大批财政收入，并能节省制造新车的开支（此等数字尚未作出统计）。此外，这次检查使铁道部了解了从来没有了解的全国车辆种类的详细数目（如：以吨位来说，从五吨到九十吨的十五种中每种有多少；以轴数来说，从二轴到七轴的六种中每种有多少），给铁道部今后高度掌握全国运用车辆、精确计算周转率，逐步作到计划运输和精确的检修工作，打下了基础。
    铁道部对于这一检查工作，事前是作了充分的思想动员和周密的准备工作的。准备工作从一月十日即已开始，共进行了二十天。铁道部滕代远部长曾于一月十二日亲自主持了各路局负责清查车辆代表会议，会上除作了思想动员并决定了具体组织清查办法、技术规定、表报格式等而外，又到丰台车站作了实地试验，作出一辆车需用三分十八秒的标准清查时间。此后又经过铁路行政、铁道系统共产党支部、铁道工会各系统的思想动员，提高了大家对爱护祖国资材和必须完成一九五○年繁重的运输和支援前线任务的认识。铁道部并责成各路局、段、站长亲自领导这一工作。为了进行这一工作，从铁道部一直到各段站均建立了各级清查委员会和清查小组。仅天津局即组织了清查小组二百二十余个，参加干部达六百余人。铁道部抽出三十六个干部到各地督导工作。许多苏联专家均亲赴现场指导。
    获鹿县政府发现开支预算太大，重新审查，精打细算，分别缓急，杜绝浪费，缩小了预算数字几近三分之一。
    【本报特讯】本报获鹿特约通讯员侯永报导：获鹿县政府地方财政委员会，实行量入为出，精打细算，使财政支出预算减少百分之三十。
    河北获鹿县编制地方财政预算时，曾经讨论过两次。第一次因缺乏足够的思想动员，各部门都以为今年地方粮征收的多，可以百废俱兴，因此造的预算都很庞大。虽经审查机关研究缩减了一部分，但仍没有精细地审查各种项目。如教育经费，去年教员薪金平均每月一百一十斤，今年实际开支按专署规定增至平均每月一百六十五斤，而预算却造了每月二百斤。其他类似情况还很多，结果预算比应征的粮数超过二十七万斤。虽然这种预算还未经上级批准，但其为数庞大，也就表现了一种浪费的倾向。县政府发现这个问题后，决定重新审查财政预算。审查前先把量入为出的精神及各种浪费情形，向各部门负责干部作了传达，提出“预算要切合实际”，“精打细算，杜绝浪费”等口号。首先在领导干部间进行酝酿，取得了思想上的一致，然后召开第二次地方财政委员会，根据上述精神重新审查预算。先把重叠不应开支的及可以缓办的部分全部取消。如：治河费原预算粮食十九万斤；但此项预算费用应由专署统一筹划，故全部取消。村级初级小学，事实上系由各村筹办，预算的教育费中却又列入村级初级小学修建费二十万斤米，经过审查也取消了。修建烈士塔，因今年群众生活困难可以缓办。经过讨论，这一项预算也全部取消。其次，某些生产事业可在企业化经营的方针下做到逐步自给，如农场苗圃原预算十四万斤米，经精打细算后只须六万斤。获鹿全部预算经审查共减少了一百一十六万斤米，新预算仅占原预算的百分之七十，而且分配亦比较合理。大家都感满意。此外该县财政委员会并决定加强征收城关公产房租工作，清理过去地方财政款项，以加强地方建设。现公产房租已收米六千余斤，其他改进财政措施亦正进行中。（编者按：侯永同志所写这篇新闻系一月份寄来的，是很有政策观点的新闻，我们为了配合二月财政会议，故留到现在才发表。此稿的缺点是没有说明该县地方财委会开会的日期。）
