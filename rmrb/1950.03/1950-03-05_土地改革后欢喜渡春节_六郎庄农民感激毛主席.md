After Land Reform, Jubilant Spring Festival: Farmers of Liulangzhuang are Grateful to Chairman Mao
Xiaodong

The early spring fields appear so bright and clear. The morning sunlight warmly shines on Liulangzhuang.

This is a larger administrative village near Haidian Town in the western suburbs of Beijing, with more than 450 households and a population of more than 2,200. Not long ago, this village completed land reform. The liberated farmers spent their first Spring Festival after liberation in boundless joy, and the village was filled with a festive atmosphere.

The village farmers' association office was bustling with activity. Young men and women crowded the room, and the sound of laughter could be heard outside the door. After Xiao Li from the Suburban Work Committee introduced the reporter to Lao Liu, the staff member in the office, the simple farmers immediately greeted the reporter warmly. Then, we started chatting like we were holding a symposium.

Dong Shuhua, the youth league secretary, a young girl with rosy cheeks and healthy skin, said frankly: "This time our Chairman Mao did a lot for us in the Soviet Union. We must work hard in production to be worthy of Chairman Mao. For example, if we harvested two dan of grain last year, we must harvest more than two dan this year. Now the Communist Party has also established winter literacy classes for us. In the past, no one cared whether we were literate or not. If the people in our village don't study culture and improve their politics, they will really let Chairman Mao down."

Yang Fengzhen, the daughter of a farmhand who had just been allocated land, said: "In the past, we women had no status. When you worked for the landlord, he was unhappy if you were a woman. Our whole family sold our strength for a lifetime, and we didn't even have a piece of land the size of a ditch. But after this land reform, Chairman Mao gave us poor people land. This year, we have land, and we also received 250 jin of rice. Our joy and gratitude to Chairman Mao cannot be expressed with just a few empty words. We must grow more grain and live a good life."

Another farmer, Yang Naikang, rushed to say: "We haven't seen Chairman Mao in person yet. This time Chairman Mao returned to Beijing, but we have already completed land reform. In addition to reporting to Chairman Mao our successful completion of land reform, everyone also wants to see Chairman Mao and ask him for suggestions on our village's production."

Zhang Shuqin, a 23-year-old young woman, also said with a blushing face: "Chairman Mao's policies are really good. In the past, the young people in our village had no connection with each other and took care of themselves. Now that we are liberated, we are all united in production and study, and our strength has increased and our knowledge has broadened. If we don't work hard in production and study, we will let Chairman Mao down."

Liu Cungang, a farmhand, said excitedly: "I am illiterate and haven't read the newspaper. When I heard that Chairman Mao had taken a long trip to the Soviet Union, I figured he went to discuss things with our Soviet friends to get us machines to engage in large-scale production. I was so happy!"

Wang Zhenjie also stood up and said: "Chairman Mao is so old, yet he traveled so far for the sake of us ordinary people, traveling tens of thousands of miles. We must be conscientious in our production this time to be worthy of our Chairman Mao."

The little girl Yang Fengzhen pouted and said: "Before the Communist Party came to our village, our family couldn't even get enough to eat. When we farmed for the landlord in the fields, he would give you pig feed, let alone think about eating dumplings!"

Zhang Shuqin added: "Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union this time and did a lot for our people. We must do a good job in large-scale production to be worthy of Chairman Mao and the Soviet Union's help to us. The folks in Liulangzhuang must strive to be labor heroes and engage in production competitions." Then, she happily touched a new piece of clothing she was wearing and hurriedly said to the reporter: "We couldn't even afford a new piece of clothing every year for the New Year, but this year we have new clothes and we ate dumplings. And my father-in-law, who is over seventy years old, sold his strength to the landlord in the fields for a lifetime, and he never thought he would have a piece of land to cultivate himself. This time, after the land reform, he was also allocated eleven mu of paddy fields. His gratitude to Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart cannot be expressed."

Leaving the office, the reporter went to visit an old farmhand, Yang Youshan. He warmly and kindly invited the reporter into his house. While pointing to the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the front wall, he said sincerely and kindly to the reporter: "Look, since liberation, I have enshrined Chairman Mao. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, would we have this house to live in today? Would we have land to cultivate? I worked as a hired laborer for others, eating bean cakes and cornbread for half my life. I never thought I would have this liberated year to eat boiled dumplings and even slaughter a pig, and my family ate several pounds of meat." He excitedly pointed to his heart and said: "If we don't put Chairman Mao here, what kind of farmer are we? Without Chairman Mao, old Yang wouldn't have today. Now that the land has been distributed, the things we produce are no longer the landlord's. Our family must work hard and produce more. When our Chairman Mao returns from the Soviet Union, we must report to him on the production situation."

On the way back from Liulangzhuang, Guo Wenzhu, the capable director of the Farmers' Association, kindly urged the reporter to bring the hearts of the liberated farmers in his village to Chairman Mao, and to tell Chairman Mao when he returned from the Soviet Union.

　　土地改革后欢喜渡春节  六郎庄农民感激毛主席
    晓东
    初春的原野显得是那么爽朗。清晨的阳光温暖地照在六郎庄。
    这是北京西郊海甸镇附近一个较大的行政村，住着四百五十多户人家，两千二百多人口。不久以前，这村子里才完成了土地改革。翻身的农民在无比的欢欣中渡过了翻身后第一个春节，村子里充满了过节的喜气。
    在村农会办公室里，显得是那么热闹。年青的男男女女拥了一屋子，谈笑声一直传到门外来。郊区工作委员会的小李向办公室里那位工作人员老刘介绍后，朴实的农民们立刻亲切地和记者打招呼。接着，我们便像开座谈会似地畅谈起来。
    青年团支书董淑华，一个红红脸蛋有着健康的肤色的年青姑娘，爽朗地说：“这次咱毛主席去苏联替咱干了好多事，咱一定要好好生产才对得起毛主席。好比去年打两担谷子，今年就一定打两担以上。如今共产党给咱们还成立了冬学识字班，过去根本就没有人管咱识字不识字。咱村的人要是再不好好学习文化提高政治，真对不起毛主席。”
    家里刚刚分到土地的雇农女儿杨凤贞说：“在过去咱们妇女就没有地位。给地主干活，他看你是女的就不高兴要。我们全家大小卖了一辈子力气，就连块沟嘴儿（水道）大的地都没有。可是这回一经过土地改革，毛主席给咱们穷人分了地。今年过年，我们家里有了地，还分到二百五十斤大米。我们的高兴和对毛主席的感激可不是光说几句空话就算了，一定要多打粮食，把日子过好。”
    另一个农民杨乃堪抢着说：“我们还没看见过毛主席真人，这回毛主席回到北京，我们却已完成了土地改革，我们除了要向毛主席报告报告我们这次胜利完成土改的工作，大伙儿还想见见毛主席，让他给咱村的生产提个意见。”
    二十三岁的年轻妇女张淑琴也红着脸说：“毛主席领导咱们的政策可真好，过去咱们村里的这些青年谁跟谁也没个连系，自个儿管自个儿。这会解放了，我们大伙都团结在一起生产、学习，力量也大了，见识也多了。我们大家要是再不好好努力生产和学习，就对不起毛主席了。”
    雇农刘存纲兴奋地说：“我不识字，也没看过报。我一听毛主席这次到苏联去了一大趟，就捉摸着是跟咱苏联朋友去商量，给咱弄机器好搞大生产，我心里可甭提多么高兴啦。”
    王振杰也站起来说：“毛主席这大岁数了，为咱老百姓走这远一趟路，来回上万里，可真不容易。咱们这回对生产一定要尽心，才对得起咱毛主席。”
    小闺女杨凤真鼓着小嘴说：“以前共产党没来咱村，我们家里连吃都吃不上，在地里给地主种地，他就拿喂猪的豆饼给你吃，更甭提还想吃顿饺子啦！”
    张淑琴又说：“毛主席这回去苏联给咱人民办了好多事回来，咱们一定要搞好大生产才对得起毛主席和苏联对咱们的帮助。六郎庄的老乡们一定要争做劳动英雄，搞生产竞赛”。接着她又高兴地摸着身上穿着的一件新衣服急忙向记者说：“每年过年咱连件新衣服都穿不上，可是今年新衣服也有了，饺子也吃上了。还有我老公公活了七十多岁，在地里给地主卖了一辈子力气，他从来也没有想到自己还会有块地种。这次土地改革，他也分到了十一亩水地，他老人家从心窝里对毛主席的感激可是说不清啦。”
    记者从办公室走出来，又去拜访了一位老雇农杨友山。他是那么热情亲切地把记者招待到他的屋里去。他一面指着正面墙上挂着的毛主席像片，一面向记者诚恳而亲切地说：“您看，我自从一解放，就把毛主席给供上了。要不是有了毛主席，咱今天那会有这房子住？那会能分到地种？我给人家做雇工，吃了半辈子的豆饼、窝窝头，想不到也有这个翻身年让我吃顿煮饺子，还杀了个小猪，家里吃了几斤肉。他兴奋地连连指着自己的心窝说：“咱要不把毛主席搁在这儿，那还算个什么农民呢？没有毛主席，咱老杨就没有今天。这回土地分到了，生产的东西再不是地主的了，咱一家人一定好好干活，多多生产，等咱毛主席从苏联回来，咱一定要给他报告报告生产情况。”
    从六郎庄回来的路上，那位精干的农会主任郭文注亲切地叮嘱着记者，一定把他村里翻身农民对毛主席感激的心带去，等毛主席从苏联回来了的时候转告给毛主席。
