　　Restoring and Developing Beijing's Commerce
　　Wang Jing
　　After being transformed and reformed following liberation, Beijing's commerce has gradually recovered and is developing. This is due to favorable conditions such as the People's Government's policy of protecting national industry and commerce, defeating the dumping of goods and control of the market by imperialists, the gradual restoration of transportation, and the opening of trade relations between urban and rural areas and domestically and abroad. Any commerce that benefits the lives of the broad masses of people, promotes trade between urban and rural areas or imports and exports, and meets the needs of industrial and agricultural production has gradually prospered; conversely, it has declined.

　　Firstly, looking at the number of commercial households: last year, a total of 5,434 households applied to open businesses (4,898 approved), and 1,996 applied to close (1,559 approved). Closures accounted for only 29.8% of openings. Comparing this with the period before liberation, we can see the overall development situation: In 1946, closures accounted for 48.4% of openings; in 1947, closures accounted for 47.2% of openings; in 1948, closures accounted for 61% of openings (the above data are based on statistics from the Kuomintang's puppet Social Bureau). The total number of commercial households last year was 27,470 in March, which increased to 30,572 in December. Among them, the number of households engaged in fuel, grain, oil, salt, non-staple food, and cultural and educational supplies increased the most, with coal shops increasing by 28%, grain stores and warehouses increasing by 19.9%, oil and salt stores and butcher shops increasing by 20.7%, and bookstores and stationery shops increasing by 18.5%. Generally speaking, the capital, trade volume, and number of shop assistants in various industries have also increased. For example, the total grain reserves of rice and flour businesses were about 5 million jin in 1948, but reached more than 10 million jin in 1949, and have now reached more than 15 million jin in 1950. In addition, households related to trade, such as cart inns, auto repair shops, vehicle material shops, copper and iron shops, and special handicraft product purchasing stations, have also increased compared to before.

　　On the other hand, some industries that are not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have declined significantly. Under the guidance of the Municipal People's Government, some of these industries have already changed their business, and some are being reorganized. For example, a total of 105 shops selling gold and silver ornaments, jewelry, jade, and antiques have closed or changed their business. Some department stores mainly selling imported goods have already closed, and those that have not closed are also doing poorly. Under today's economic conditions, this phenomenon does not represent the decline of commerce; on the contrary, it represents the progress of commerce, because colonial-style commerce serving a small number of people is bound to be eliminated. Another fact is that the cloth business is also not doing well. The cloth business is an industry related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so why is it not doing well? According to Gao Shouxin, the chairman of the Cloth Industry Association, "More than 80% of our cloth shops sell slow-moving goods such as silk, hemp silk, and Shanghai woolen cloth. Slow-moving goods cannot be sold, and capital cannot be turned over. Although 20% of our business is in cloth, it is still not enough to cover monthly expenses." They also know that facing the peasants and selling cloth to the Northwest and Northeast would have sales and profits, but based on the above situation, they have difficulties. This is a temporary phenomenon in the process of reorganization.

　　Private banks and money shops in the financial industry, under the leadership and control of the government, have reduced speculation and developed legitimate business: at the end of March last year, the city's financial industry had only 108 million yuan in deposits, which had increased to 9.885 billion yuan by the end of December. Looking at the figures for deposit and loan business: at the end of June last year, loans accounted for only 76% of deposits, and at the end of December, loans accounted for only 59% of deposits, tightening ordinary commercial loans and credit loans.

　　In summary, Beijing's commerce since liberation has been in a state of recovery and development, and those that are not suitable for the people's livelihood are also being reorganized or changing their business. This is a normal and reasonable progressive phenomenon. There are still some difficult problems in the reorganization and change of business, such as industries that do not meet the needs of the people, wanting to change their business but not knowing what industry to change to and how to operate; some industries that are not doing well, due to the large number of personnel and large expenses, often cause labor-capital disputes; some capitalists are still negative about operating legitimate business, reducing operations, and withdrawing funds for speculation. These are all urgent problems to be solved. Therefore, the Municipal Commercial Bureau should strengthen guidance, guide industries that do not meet the needs of the people to change their business, and strengthen those that meet the needs of the people, so as to develop trade between urban and rural areas and coordinate with industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, efforts should be made to guide idle funds into production. State-owned commercial enterprises should also strengthen the leadership of private businesses through business, such as the Grain Company organizing private businesses to purchase wheat in the Northwest, and the Cotton Yarn and General Merchandise Company wholesaling cotton yarn and general merchandise to private businesses, which is very necessary.

### 恢复发展中的北京市商业

　　恢复发展中的北京市商业
    王敬
    解放后的北京市商业经过改造、转变，已逐渐恢复并走向发展。这是因为在人民政府保护民族工商业政策下，打垮了帝国主义的倾销商品和控制市场，逐渐恢复了交通，打开了城乡内外贸易关系等有利条件下形成的。凡是有利于广大人民生活，能促进城乡或出入口贸易，适合工农业生产需要的商业，都由恢复渐趋繁荣；反之，就日渐萧条没落。
    首先从商业户数来看：在去年申请开业的共五千四百三十四户（批准四千八百九十八户），申请歇业的一千九百九十六户（批准一千五百五十九户），歇业仅占开业的百分之二十九点八。如果和解放前比较一下，就可以看出总的发展情况：一九四六年歇业占开业的百分之四十八点四，一九四七年歇业占开业的百分之四十七点二，一九四八年歇业占开业的百分之六十一（以上根据国民党统治时伪社会局的统计资料）。去年的商户总数，三月为二万七千四百七十户，到十二月便增加到三万零五百七十二户。其中以经营燃料、粮谷、油盐副食品、文化教育用品等户增加最多，计煤铺增加百分之二十八，粮店、粮栈等增加百分之十九点九，油盐店、肉铺等增加百分之二十点七，书店、文具纸张店等增加百分之十八点五。各行业的资金、贸易额和店员人数等，总的说起来，也是增加了，如米面粮业一九四八年各户存粮总额约五百万斤，一九四九年则达一千多万斤，一九五○年已存到一千五百多万斤了。此外，和贸易有关的如大车店、汽车行、车辆材料行、铜铁铺、特种手工艺品收购所等户，也都较前增多。
    另外一方面，一些无利于国计民生的行业便显著萧条了。这些行业在市人民政府指导下，有的已经转业，有的正在改组。如金银饰物、珠宝玉石及古玩等商店，歇业或转业者共一百零五户，以经营舶来品为主的百货店有的已经歇业，没歇业的营业也都不好。这种现象在今天经济条件下，不能代表商业的衰落，反之却正表示商业的进步，因为殖民地性的为少数人服务的商业是必然被淘汰的。另外一个事实是布业的营业也不好，布业是有关国计民生的行业为什么营业也不好呢？从布业公会理事长高守信的话中可以看出，他说：“我们布店里百分之八十以上是绸缎、麻绸和上海线呢等冷货，冷货卖不出去，资金周转不过来，虽然百分之二十经营布，每月仍不够开支。”他们也知道面向农民，经营布到西北和东北去，是会有销路利润的，但是基于以上情形，就有了困难，这是改组过程中的一种暂时现象。
    金融业的私营银行钱庄在政府领导和管制下，减少了投机，发展了正当的营业：去年三月底全市金融业仅有存款一亿零八百万元，到十二月底已增到九十八亿八千五百多万元。从存放款业务数字来看：去年六月底放款只占存款的百分之七十六，十二月底放款只占存款数字百分之五十九，紧缩了普通商业放款和信用贷款。
    综合以上情况来看，解放以来的北京商业是在恢复和发展中，不适于国民生计的，亦正在改组或转业。这是一种正常而合理的进步现象。在改组和转业中仍存在一些困难问题，如不适合人民需要的行业，想转业不知应转何业，怎样去经营；一些营业不好的行业，因人员多、开支大，常引起劳资纠纷；部分资本家对经营正当商业仍表消极，缩小经营，抽出资金投机，这些都是当前亟待解决的问题。因此，市政府商业局应加强指导工作，对不适合人民需要的行业，引导其转业；对适合人民需要的要加强，以发展城乡贸易，配合工农业生产。同时设法诱导游资投向生产。国营商业也应通过业务，协助政府加强领导私商，如粮食公司组织私商到西北采购小麦，花纱布和百货公司批发给私商纱布和百货等，是很必要的。
