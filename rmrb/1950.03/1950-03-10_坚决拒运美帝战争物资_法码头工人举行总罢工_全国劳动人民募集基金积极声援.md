Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th: Paris dispatch: As the first batch of military supplies allocated to France by the United States under the "Military Aid" Act is about to arrive, the movement of French dockworkers refusing to load and unload munitions is continuing to expand. On the 4th, under the call of the French General Confederation of Labor, dockworkers in Bordeaux, Calais, Dunkirk, and ports across the country, as well as ports in Algiers, North Africa, held a 24-hour protest general strike, despite the authorities' suppression. Dockworkers in Rouen, disregarding the threat of wage cuts, also refused to unload the "Lyon Ville" ship, which was about to transport a large number of military equipment.

Simultaneous with the dockworkers' movement to refuse unloading munitions, workers in other industries in France are experiencing increasingly high anti-war and wage increase strike movements. According to the French Metalworkers' Federation's estimate reported by TASS, on March 6th, approximately 500,000 people across the country participated in the metalworkers' strike.

The strike held by Paris underground tram and bus workers on the 6th has brought traffic in the French capital to a standstill. The strike by all employees of Air France and the strike held at沃莱·部尔日 and other airports on the 4th of this month have interrupted the entire air transport system. In addition, 40,000 construction and carpentry workers, more than 20,000 chemical workers, and more than 20,000 textile workers in the Lille district also held strikes.

Urban and rural working people in France are raising funds for the strikers to show their support. Municipal councils in various cities have also decided to donate funds to assist the striking workers. The municipal councils of Marseilles and Asnières, a suburb of Paris, have decided to donate 15 million francs as a fund for the strikers. Six municipal councils in the departments of Seine and瓦斯 have also donated 11 million francs. Several municipal councils have also decided to provide strikers and their families with free meals, milk, and shoes.

　　坚决拒运美帝战争物资
    法码头工人举行总罢工
    全国劳动人民募集基金积极声援
    【新华社北京九日电】巴黎讯：当美国根据“军事援助”法案拨交法国的首批军事物资即将到达之时，法国码头工人拒绝装卸军火的运动正继续扩大。四日，在法国总工会的号召下，波尔多、加莱、敦刻尔克和全国各港口以及北非阿尔及尔各港口的码头工人，不顾当局的镇压，举行了二十四小时的抗议性总罢工。卢昂的码头工人亦不顾削减工资的威胁，拒绝起卸即将运到大批军事装备的“里昂维尔”号轮船。
    与码头工人拒卸军火运动同时，法国其他各业工人反战与要求增加工资的罢工运动，也日益高涨。据塔斯社引法金属工人联合会估计，三月六日，全国各地约有五十万人参加金属工人的罢工。
    巴黎地下电车与公共汽车工人于六日举行的罢工，已使法首都交通陷于停顿。法国航空公司全体职工的罢工及沃莱·部尔日和其他各飞机场于本月四日举行的罢工，已使整个空运为之中断。此外，四万建筑业及木工工人，两万多化学工人及里尔区两万余纺织工人也举行了罢工。
    法国城乡劳动人民正在替罢工者募集基金，以示声援。各城市的市政委员会也决定捐款援助罢工工人。马赛和巴黎近郊阿斯尼尔两地的市政委员会已决定捐一千五百万法郎作为罢工者的基金。塞纳和瓦斯两省内的六个市政委员会也捐了一千一百万法郎。若干市政委员会并决定免费供给罢工者和他们的家属膳食、牛奶和鞋子。
