　　Guarantee Completion of This Year's Tax Revenue Task
    Kaifeng Has Sufficient Tax Sources
    [This Newspaper’s Report] According to the Henan Daily on March 20th: To ensure the successful completion of this year's tax revenue task, the Kaifeng Municipal Tax Bureau has made a tax revenue estimate for 1950. On March 7th, after the provincial tax conference specifically allocated tax revenue tasks to each special district and city, the quota for Kaifeng City increased two and a half times compared to last year. Some cadres in the bureau felt that "the task is too heavy and difficult to complete." In particular, only 5.5 million jin of wheat was collected in January and February of this year, which is far from the target, further increasing this sense of blindly complaining about the burden. On March 8th, in order to understand the actual burden on businessmen in the city, the bureau sent people to conduct surprise inspections of accounts. In eleven industries and twenty-one households, it was found that 80% of the accounts were fake. Based on the real materials learned from this account inspection, it proved that the businessmen who originally shouted about heavy taxes were mostly trying to evade their burdens. At the beginning of this month, they began to study tax sources and calculate income. Currently, there are more than 50 cigarette factories in the city, producing 170 to 220 cartons of cigarettes daily. Based on the lowest number (170 cartons), it is estimated that in the next ten months, the cigarette production and sales tax alone can collect 20.4 million jin of wheat. According to last year's collection situation of industrial and commercial taxes and the conclusions drawn from recent account inspections, it is estimated that it will not be difficult to complete the expected task. For temporary commercial tax, commission tax, stamp tax, etc., from the repeatedly discovered tax evasion cases, it is estimated that commission tax evasion is at least 30%, and stamp tax evasion is 40%. In the future, as long as tax cadres strengthen the elimination of tax evasion, this year's income will greatly increase compared to last year. After such calculations, most cadres in the bureau have increased their confidence in completing this year's tax revenue task.

　　保证今年税收任务完成
    开封税源充足
    【本报讯】据三月二十日河南日报消息：为保证今年税收任务的胜利完成，开封市税务局已作出一九五○年的税收概算。三月七日，省税务会议具体分配了各专、市的税收任务后，汴市配额较去年增加两倍半。该局部分干部觉得“任务太重，不易完成。”尤其今年一、二两月份仅征起小麦五百五十万斤，距离任务很远，更增加了这种盲目叫重情绪。三月八日，该局为了解本市商人的确实负担情况，即派人突击查账，在十一业二十一户中，发现百分之八十都是假账。根据这次查账所了解到的真实材料，证明原来叫喊税重的商人，大都是希图逃避负担。本月上旬开始研究税源，计算收入；目前，本市共有烟厂五十多家，每天可出产纸烟一百七十箱到二百二十箱，按最低数（一百七十箱）计算，估计今后十个月，仅卷烟产销税一项即可征收小麦二千零四十万斤。工商税按照去年的征收情形和最近查账所得出的结论，估计亦不难完成预期的任务。临时商业税收、行佣税、印花税等，从屡次查获的漏税案件中，估计行佣税最少偷漏百分之三十，印花税偷漏百分之四十，今后只要加强税收干部杜绝偷税漏税，今年收入将会较去年大大增加。经过这样的计算后，该局大部分干部对完成今年的税收任务信心均已提高。
