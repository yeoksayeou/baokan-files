　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in order to protect legitimate salt merchants, safeguard the interests of the masses, and guarantee national salt tax revenue, has sent a directive to all major administrative regions and directly administered municipalities to strengthen the management of indigenous salt. It is reported that currently, some local people's governments are advocating mass scraping and sun-drying of indigenous salt for production and disaster relief, leading to a sharp increase in the production of indigenous salt. According to preliminary statistics, the daily amount of indigenous salt boiled in the coastal areas of the Tangshan sub-district alone is more than 100,000 jin. This method is undoubtedly beneficial for disaster relief, but from a comprehensive perspective, it is extremely harmful. Because these indigenous salts flood the market in large quantities and are sold at low prices, hindering the business of legitimate salt merchants and damaging national treasury revenue, which violates the overall salt management policy and affects the annual fiscal task. It will also create new difficulties for the future gradual cessation of these indigenous salt flats and helping salt farmers to switch to other occupations. To this end, the Government Administration Council has specifically telegraphed all major administrative regions and directly administered municipalities to conduct thorough inspections. In areas producing indigenous salt, local governments must assist salt affairs organs in strengthening the management of indigenous salt. Salt flats that have already been shut down should not be restored, and cadres and the masses should be persuaded to think of more production methods in other areas. In addition, it has been decided that local people's governments will provide appropriate relief within their capabilities to indigenous salt households who are experiencing extreme difficulties in their lives due to the cessation of indigenous salt boiling and require relief.

　　政务院电令各地加强管理土盐
    维护正当盐商保证国家收入
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府政务院，为保护正当盐商，维护群众利益及保证国家盐税收入，已电令各大行政区及直辖省市加强土盐管理。据息：现在个别地区人民政府，因生产救灾提倡群众刮晒土盐，致使土盐产量骤增，据初步统计，仅唐山分区沿海一带每日熬制土盐数量即在十万斤以上，此种办法对于救灾不无好处，但从全面来说则极有害，因这些土盐大量涌进市场，贱价销售，既妨害正当盐商营业，且使国库收入受到损蚀，违背整个盐务管理方针，影响全年财政任务；对将来逐渐停废这些土盐滩地，帮助盐民转业，亦必增加新的困难。为此，政务院特电令各大行政区各直辖省市彻底进行检查，在出产土盐地区，当地政府必须协助盐务机关加强土盐管理，已经停废的滩地，不宜再行恢复，说服干部和群众，应从其他方面多想生产办法。此外并决定对于因停止熬制土盐而生活十分困难必须救济的土盐户，将由当地人民政府在可能范围内酌予设法救济。
