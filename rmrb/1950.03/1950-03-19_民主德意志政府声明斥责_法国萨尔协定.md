Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th. With the endorsement of the United States, France and the so-called "Saar Autonomous Government" have signed an agreement to openly annex the Saar. This illegal act, which violates the Potsdam Agreement, has aroused resolute opposition from the German people. According to TASS, the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the 13th, vehemently denouncing the "French Saar Agreement" as "a huge act of coercion by the Western powers against the German people," and declared: "The German people do not recognize now, nor will they ever recognize in the future, the separation of the Saar region from Germany and its annexation by French imperialism."

According to Agence France-Presse, the so-called "French Saar Agreement" was signed in Paris on the 3rd by French Foreign Minister Schuman and "Saar Government" Chairman Hoffmann. According to the agreement, France enjoys mining rights, railway management rights, and other privileges in the Saar's mineral deposits economically. Politically, the French representative in the Saar enjoys the power of veto over the measures taken by the "Saar Government." In this way, France will establish complete colonial rule in the Saar under the guise of "autonomy." In the negotiations on the Saar issue, US imperialism played a despicable double game: on the one hand, it supported France's demands to infringe upon the interests of the German people, as a condition for the French government to be more submissive to the United States; on the other hand, the United States instigated its West German puppet Adenauer to oppose it, apparently intending to use the contradictions between France and Germany to help it strengthen its control over Western European countries.

　　民主德意志政府声明斥责“法国萨尔协定”
    【新华社十八日讯】在美国的认可下，法国与所谓“萨尔自治政府”签订协定，公开吞并萨尔。这一破坏波茨坦协定的非法行为，已引起德国人民的坚决反对。据塔斯社柏林讯，德意志民主共和国政府于十三日发表声明，力斥“法国萨尔协定”为“西方强权反对德国人民的巨大强制行为”，并宣称：“德国人民现在不承认，将来也决不承认萨尔区脱离德国及其被法国帝国主义所吞并”。
    据法新社讯，所谓“法国萨尔协定”，系法外长舒曼与“萨尔政府”主席豪福门于三日在巴黎所签订。根据该协定，在经济上，法国享有萨尔矿藏的开采权、铁路管理权及其他种种特权。在政治上，法国驻萨尔代表对“萨尔政府”所采取的措施，享有否决权。这样，法国将在“自治”的幌子下，在萨尔建立完全的殖民地统治。在萨尔问题的谈判中，美帝国主义曾玩弄卑鄙的两面手法：一方面支持法国侵害德国人民利益的要求，作为法国政府对美国更加驯服的条件，另一方面美国又唆使其西德傀儡阿登纳出来反对，显欲利用法德的矛盾，以助其加强对于西欧国家的控制。
