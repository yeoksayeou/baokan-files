　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Hangzhou, Qingdao, Nanning and other places are strengthening air defense measures. Since the bandit planes, under the command of American imperialism, indiscriminately bombed Hangzhou City on February 21st, all organs, factories, schools, and residents' committees in the city have universally established air defense organizations, and all public and private factories have universally installed air defense equipment. An expanded anti-bombing propaganda campaign was conducted throughout the city on February 26th. The city, with the Health Bureau and Public Security Bureau as the main bodies, established a general rescue station and fire fighting organization, and compiled all public and private hospitals, clinics, and doctor teams into fifty air defense rescue stations. The city's fire fighters conducted exercises and newly installed fire trucks and hydrants. Many factories automatically installed power generation equipment after the power supply was cut off, and some factory workers manually shook machines to continue maintaining production. The First Machinery Production and Sales Joint Office concentrated twelve member factories to establish a general factory to maintain production. People from all walks of life responded to the bandit planes' atrocities by continuing to oversubscribe to public bonds. According to statistics on the 11th of this month, out of the 1.74 million shares of public bonds subscribed in the city (the original allocated amount was 1.5 million shares), one million shares have been paid for.
    The Youth Air Defense Command has issued orders for light control, and the Public Security Bureau is conducting extensive anti-bombing propaganda and mobilization among citizens. Major enterprises have dug air raid shelters, organized rescue stations and patrol teams, and thoroughly inspected fire-fighting equipment. Organs and groups have also established guard squads to inspect and strengthen air defense, fire fighting, and other equipment.
    Nanning City, Guangxi Province, has begun air defense preparations. The city's Garrison Command and the Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a proclamation stipulating measures such as air raid signals, construction of air raid shelters, light control, fire fighting, rescue, and prevention of saboteurs.
    Furthermore, people from all walks of life in Fuzhou City are donating money, food, and clothing to express sympathy and aid the disaster victims who were bombed on the 4th of this month.

    加强防空措施
    公私工厂普遍装置防空设备对市民广泛进行反轰炸宣传
    【新华社二十日讯】杭州、青岛、南宁等地加强防空措施。自二月二十一日匪机在美国帝国主义指挥下滥炸杭州市后，全市各机关、工厂、学校、居民委员会即普遍成立了防空组织，各公、私工厂普遍装置了防空设备。二月二十六日全市进行了反轰炸扩大宣传。全市以卫生局和公安局为主体成立了救护总站和消防组织，并将各公、私医院、诊疗所、医师小组等编成五十个防空救护站。全市消防人员进行了演习，并新装置了消防汽车和水龙头。许多工厂在电源断绝后，都自动装置了发电设备，有的工厂职工以人力摇动机器来继续维持生产。第一机器产销联合处，将十二个会员厂集中起来设立总厂维持生产。各界市民以继续超额认购公债来回答匪机暴行。据本月十一日的统计，全市认购公债的一百七十四万分中（原分配额为一百五十万分），已有一百万分缴了款。
    青年防空指挥部已发布灯火管制的命令，公安局对市民广泛进行反轰炸宣传动员。各大企业单位都挖了防空壕，组织救护站和巡逻队，彻底检查了消防工具。各机关、团体也纷纷成立了警卫班，检查和加强防空、消防等设备。
    广西南宁市已进行防空准备。市警备司令部和市公安局发出布告，规定防空讯号、修建防空壕、灯火管制、消防、救护、防范破坏分子等措施。
    又讯：福州市各界人民正纷纷捐款、捐粮和衣物，慰问救助本月四日被炸的灾民。
