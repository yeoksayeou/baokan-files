　　Dagu Chengzi Village Raises Funds for Education; Northeast Education Department Sends Letter of Encouragement
    Corrects Third District Government of Xinmin for Misinterpreting Policy
    [Report from this newspaper] According to a report in the Northeast Daily on the 25th, the Northeast People's Government Education Department sent a letter on the 17th to the cadres of Dagu Chengzi Village, Third District, Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, encouraging the villagers' behavior of understanding the country's current financial difficulties, voluntarily tightening their belts, and raising funds to run schools. At the same time, the department instructed the Liaoxi Provincial Education Department to criticize the Third District Government of Xinmin County for misinterpreting policies and hindering the people from raising funds to run schools.
    In Dagu Chengzi Village, Third District, Xinmin County, there was an elementary school during the puppet Manchukuo period, which was later forcibly merged by the local tyrant landlord of the neighboring Zhangjingbaozi Village. The village is more than two *li* away from Zhangjingbaozi, separated by a river and a ditch, making it inconvenient for children to attend school, resulting in many children dropping out. After liberation, the villagers voluntarily established a school. Last year, although the village did not have a bumper harvest, the farmers still tightened their belts, developed sideline production, and voluntarily bore all the expenses of the village's complete elementary school (six classes, seven teachers, and 283 students), and were able to pay on time. This spring, the villagers have even greater confidence in running the school well. However, the local district government misinterpreted the "consolidation and improvement" policy and ordered the advanced classes of the village's elementary school to merge with Zhangjingbaozi Elementary School, believing that the villagers' voluntary burden of the school's expenses was a "disguised apportionment." The villagers repeatedly petitioned the district government, jointly signing and stamping their requests for approval to establish advanced classes. The district government repeatedly delayed and prevaricated, causing the school to be open for more than ten days, and more than eighty advanced students in the village were still unable to attend school. The villagers sent representatives to the Xinmin County People's Government for instructions, but no clear solution was obtained. Therefore, the village sent representatives again, carrying an application jointly signed and stamped by all the villagers, to the Northeast People's Government Education Department for instructions. The department immediately sent personnel to the local area to investigate and learned that the village's fundraising for education was indeed out of the villagers' own volition. At a mass meeting of more than 300 people, liberated peasants recounted the pain of not being able to attend school in the past and unanimously stated that, on the premise of not hindering spring plowing production, they vowed to run the village's elementary school well by tightening their belts. The Xinmin County Magistrate also expressed his agreement to the village establishing a complete elementary school. After understanding the village's situation, the Northeast People's Government immediately sent a letter to the aforementioned responsible cadres in Dagu Cheng, encouraging the villagers' behavior of raising funds for education and approving the advanced classes of the village's elementary school. At the same time, it instructed the Liaoxi Provincial Education Department to urge Xinmin County to help Dagu Chengzi Village Elementary School solve the difficulty of insufficient teachers, and to strictly criticize the Third District Government of Xinmin County for misinterpreting policies. The Northeast Daily also published a short commentary titled "Reward the People for Running Schools." The short commentary pointed out: The policy of focusing on consolidation and improvement in education work in the old liberated areas this year is determined based on the state's financial expenditure and the quality of existing school education. But this does not mean that the government does not allow the people to run schools; on the contrary, the government rewards the people for running schools. The Northeast People's Government promulgated "Interim Measures for Supporting, Rewarding, and Consolidating Private Middle and Primary Schools" last month, rewarding the people for running schools under the principles of need and willingness. The short commentary said: "The enthusiasm of the people of Dagu Chengzi Village in running schools is worthy of praise, and the people of all localities should be called upon to learn from the village."

　　大古城子村集资兴学  东北教育部致函鼓励
    纠正新民第三区政府曲解政策
    【本报讯】据东北日报二十五日消息：东北人民政府教育部于十七日致函辽西省新民县第三区大古城子村的干部，鼓励该村人民体谅国家当前财政困难，自愿节衣缩食，集资办学的行为；同时该部指示辽西省教育厅，批评曲解政策，阻碍人民集资兴学的新民县第三区区政府。
    新民县第三区大古城子村在伪满时原有小学一所，后被邻村章京堡子的大地主恶霸强行合并。该村距章京堡子有二里多远，中隔一河一沟，子弟入学不便，很多儿童因此失学，解放后，该村人民乃自动建立学校，去年该村虽然收成不丰，但农民仍节衣缩食，开展副业生产，自愿负担该村完小的全部经费（六个班，七名教员，学生二八三名），并能按时开支。今春该村群众办好学校的信心更高。但当地区政府曲解“巩固与提高”的方针，命令该村小学高级班与章京堡子小学合并，认为该村群众自愿负担学校的经费是“变相摊派”。该村群众曾屡次联名盖章向区政府请求批准设立高级班，区政府一再拖延推诿，致使学校已开学十余日，该村高级学生八十余名仍不能就学。该村群众为此曾派代表到新民县人民政府请示，亦未得明快解决。因此，该村又推派代表并携带全村人民联名盖章的申请书向东北人民政府教育部请示。该部即派员赴当地调查，得悉该村集资兴学确出于群众的自愿。在三百余人的群众大会上，翻身农民诉述过去不能上学的痛苦，一致表示在不妨碍春耕生产的原则下，誓以节衣缩食来办好该村的小学。新民县县长亦表示同意该村设立完全小学。东北人民政府于了解村子情况后，即致函大古城上述负责干部，鼓励该村人民集资办学的行为，批准该村小学的高级班。同时指示辽西省教育厅，着其督促新民县帮助大古城子村小学解决教员不足的困难，并对曲解政策的新民县第三区区政府予以严格批评。东北日报亦以“奖励人民办学”为题发表短评。短评指出：本年老解放区教育工作以巩固与提高为主的方针，是根据国家财政开支的情况及现有学校教育的质量而决定的。但这决不是说政府不许人民兴办学校；相反的，政府奖励人民办学。东北人民政府曾于上月间颁发“扶植、奖励、整理私立中、小学校暂行办法”，奖励人民在需要与自愿原则下办学。短评说：“像大古城子村人民群众那样热心兴办学校，是值得表扬的，应号召各地人民群众向该村学习。”
