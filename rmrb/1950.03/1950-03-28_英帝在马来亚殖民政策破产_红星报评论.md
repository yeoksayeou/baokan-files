Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th: Red Star newspaper commentators emphasize the bankruptcy of British colonial policy in Malaya. He writes: The British colonialists have been waging war in Malaya for more than eighteen months, but their scheme to crush all resistance by the Malayan people has been defeated. Britain has 120,000 strong army, air force, tank corps and navy participating in the operation. The colonialists used extremely cruel means to shoot, hang, and torture thousands of Malayan patriots to death. More than 10,000 people have been thrown into prisons and concentration camps, 10,000 people have been deported, and hundreds of villages have been destroyed into rubble. The Labor government has spent 150 million pounds to eliminate the Malayan people, an amount that is almost one-fifth of Britain's direct military appropriation for 1950.

Despite the enormous advantages in manpower and equipment, the British aggressors have not defeated the heroic Malayan National Liberation Army.

Regardless of the demands of the broad masses of the British people to end the colonial war against Malaya, the Labor government has launched a month-long "mopping up" campaign, and rushed the 26th Infantry Brigade from Hong Kong, and flew a squadron of Lincoln bombers from the United Kingdom to reinforce the combat troops. However, this bloody "mopping up" will suffer a shameful defeat like their previous operations. The policy of the British Labor Party leaders to continue the colonial war in Malaya exposes them as direct pawns and slaves of the monopoly capitalists of the "City" of London.

　　英帝在马来亚殖民政策破产  红星报评论
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：红星报评论员着重指出英国在马来亚殖民政策的破产。他写道：英国殖民者在马来亚发动战争以来，已经渡过十八个月以上，但他们打碎马来亚人民抵抗的一切计谋已遭失败。英国有十二万强有力的陆军、空军、坦克队和海军都参加了作战。殖民者用非常残酷的手段将数千名马来亚的爱国者枪毙、吊死和折磨死。约有一万余人被投入监狱和集中营，一万人被驱出国境，数百个村庄被毁成瓦砾。工党政府曾花费了一亿五千万英镑来消灭马来亚人民，这个数目几乎是英国一九五○年直接军事拨款的五分之一。
    尽管在人力和装备上有巨大的优越条件，但是，英国侵略者并没有击溃英勇的马来亚民族解放军。
    工党政府不顾英国广大人民的结束对马来亚殖民战争的要求，更发动为期一个月的“清剿”运动，并从香港赶紧派来第二十六步兵旅，又从英国飞来林肯轰炸机中队，以增援作战部队。但是，他们这种血腥的“清剿”，仍将像他们以前历次的行动一样遭到可耻的惨败。而英国工党领袖在马来亚继续殖民战争的政策，却暴露了他们是伦敦“城”的垄断资本家的直接走狗和奴仆。
