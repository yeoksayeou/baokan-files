Hurry to Pay Vehicle License Tax!
　　Beijing to Conduct City-Wide Vehicle License Inspection for Ten Days
    [Beijing News] The Municipal Taxation Bureau has decided to begin a city-wide inspection of vehicle license usage starting from the 10th. Since the commencement of the 1950 first half-year vehicle license tax collection in Beijing on February 1st, vehicle users have generally been paying taxes well. As of March 6th, the Beijing Taxation Bureau has received tax payments equivalent to over 3.14 million jin of millet. As for the small number of vehicles that have not yet paid taxes, they should seize the opportunity on this last day (today, the 9th) to go to the respective taxation sub-bureaus to pay taxes according to regulations. Otherwise, once discovered after the deadline, they will be punished according to regulations. The collection of vehicle license tax in Beijing was originally scheduled to end at the end of February, and penalties should have been imposed after the deadline. However, due to the impact of the Spring Festival on payment, the Taxation Bureau extended the payment period based on the actual situation. As for the 20% penalty added to the tax paid by users on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, the Municipal Taxation Bureau has now decided to issue a notice to all taxation sub-bureaus to refund the full amount separately. Those who paid taxes during those three days can bring their original receipts to the original taxation sub-bureau to receive a refund starting from the 10th. In addition, there are two types of animal-drawn carts, those with rubber tires and those with iron tires, with a significant difference in their carrying capacity. The original tax amount was the same for both, at 100 jin. After the Taxation Bureau submitted a request to the Central Taxation Administration for approval, it has been decided to reduce the tax amount for large iron-wheeled carts to 50 jin (those few animal-drawn iron-wheeled carts that have already paid 100 jin will be refunded 50 jin). As for commercial vehicles and three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws owned by vehicle factories, the Municipal Taxation Bureau has approved payment in installments due to the difficulty of paying the tax all at once. Half should be paid before the end of February, and the other half before March 15th.

　　快纳牌照税！
    京市车辆牌照定十日普遍检查
    【北京讯】市府税务局决定自十日起开始全市车辆使用牌照的普遍检查。京市一九五○年上半年车辆使用牌照税自二月一日开征以来，各种车辆使用者纳税情形一般还好，到三月六日止，京市税务局收到税款共折小米三百一十四万余斤。至于少数尚未上税的车辆，应抓紧今（九）日最后一天的机会，去各税务分局照章纳税。否则，逾期一经查出，即按章处罚。京市使用牌照税的开征，原定于二月底截止，过期本应处罚，后因春节期间影响缴纳，税务局乃根据实际情形，延长了缴款期限。至于在三、四、五日三天对使用者上税所加百分之二十的罚款，市税务局顷亦已决定通令各税务分局如数分别退还，在该三天内上税者可持原收据于十日起至原上税分局退款。另外，兽力货车中有胶轮与铁轮两种，其载重量相差很多，而原定纳税额同为一百斤，后经税务局呈请中央税务总局批准，已决定将铁轮大车税额减为五十斤（少数兽力铁轮车已缴一百斤者，退回五十斤）。至于营业汽车及车厂子所有的三轮车、人力车，因一次纳税感到困难，市税务局已准予分期缴纳，二月底以前缴一半，三月十五日以前缴一半。
