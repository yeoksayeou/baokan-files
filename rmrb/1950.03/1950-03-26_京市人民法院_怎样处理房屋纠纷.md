    How the Beijing Municipal People's Court
    Handles Housing Disputes

    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In the Beijing Municipal People's Court's case statistics from March 18 to December 31, 1949, housing cases accounted for a significant proportion, totaling 2,603 cases, representing 41% of all civil cases. In the early days of Beijing's liberation, some citizens did not understand the People's Government's housing policy, mistakenly believing that just as land was being equally distributed in the countryside, houses would also be equally distributed in the cities. Furthermore, enemy agents maliciously spread rumors, resulting in very chaotic relationships between landlords and tenants. On May 16th of last year, the Military Control Commission issued a public notice addressing housing issues, clearly defining the protection of homeowners' ownership rights and the right to obtain legitimate profits, while also protecting tenants' legitimate use during the lease period. This dispelled the ideological concerns of parties involved in housing disputes, encouraging them to establish normal lease relationships through litigation. Consequently, housing cases sharply increased in June and July, nearly doubling.

    Based on the 1,680 housing cases handled by the People's Court over a ten-month period (including 919 cases resolved through mediation and judgment, and 761 cases withdrawn or dismissed after persuasion), the disputes can be classified into the following types based on their nature:

    Lease Disputes

    The first category is housing lease disputes, including disputes arising from rent increases, rent reductions, subletting, rent arrears, and lease expiration, accounting for 63% of all cases. Among these, rent arrears disputes were the most common, accounting for half. Rent arrears disputes were mostly caused by the fact that, after several rounds of exploitative "currency reforms" by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, rents had become too low, leading landlords to demand rent increases and refuse to accept rent payments. Alternatively, disputes arose because rents were calculated based on flour in the past, resulting in excessively high rents that tenants could not afford, leading them to request rent reductions and refuse to pay rent.

    Ownership Disputes

    The second category is housing ownership disputes, including issues related to buying and selling, redemption, commercial base rights, the houses of leading war criminals, and housing speculation. These disputes mainly involved undetermined housing ownership, illegal seizure of enemy property, speculation in housing for profit, old practices of "mortgaging for three and selling for four" in housing transactions, leading to outstanding payments and delays in delivery, or disputes arising from the inconsistency between the ownership of storefronts and commercial bases.

    Eviction Disputes

    The third category is eviction disputes. Landlords and tenants agreed to hand over the house, but disputes arose during the handover process regarding the repayment of past deposits (including unreasonable deposits), excessively high moving expenses, how to convert rents deposited in the puppet court, and compensation for housing repair expenses incurred by the tenant during the lease period.

    When handling housing disputes, the People's Court, based on the fundamental spirit of protecting urban housing and encouraging private construction as outlined in the May 16th Military Control Commission's public notice on housing issues, abolished various unreasonable practices, such as excessively high deposits (i.e., deposits exceeding one month's rent) and "rotten upon entry" deposits, as well as various bad habits when renting a house, such as "one tea, one rent, one cleaning." Some tenants took advantage of "depositing" rent in puppet courts, post offices, and banks to live in houses for free, while the landlord still bore the cost of housing repairs and property taxes. The People's Government did not recognize this extremely unreasonable phenomenon and still treated it as rent arrears. However, for tenants who had "deposited" a large amount, to minimize their economic losses, this "deposit" was treated as a factual matter, and the amount they were required to repay was reduced appropriately when determining the amount of rent arrears to be made up.

    Rent, Eviction, and Moving Expenses

    For housing disputes caused by rent amounts, the opinions of both parties are first respected, and they are allowed to negotiate freely and convert the rent into kind. If an agreement cannot be reached, the court will make an appropriate judgment based on the economic situation of both parties and the size, condition, and location of the house. New lease contracts or judgments of compensation reached through court mediation are all converted into kind. For tenants with long-term rent arrears, they are generally also converted into kind at the time of the arrears.

    Regarding requests for eviction or moving expenses, the court first determines whether the landlord's purpose for eviction meets the eviction conditions and whether it affects the development of urban industry and commerce, not making moving expenses a prerequisite. The existence and amount of moving expenses are determined based on the economic capacity of the landlord and tenant and the length of time they have lived in the house.

    Sub-Landlord Issues

    The People's Government, in principle, does not recognize sub-landlords, as they generally engage in intermediary exploitation. If disputes arise, the People's Court will facilitate the direct establishment of a new lease contract between the tenant and the landlord.

    In terms of working methods, the People's Court has adopted: 1. Court trials; 2. On-site trials (combining on-site investigation and trial by the district public office); 3. Collective trials: systematically summoning parties involved in similar cases, having judges explain policies and regulations, using typical cases for judgment, and educating and encouraging the parties to discuss and study and solve problems themselves.

    More Mediation Than Judgments

    Over the past year, the People's Government has achieved results in protecting urban housing. First, it implemented the spirit of the Military Control Commission's housing public notice through trials, negated the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of unilaterally protecting "tenants," clarified the malicious propaganda of enemy agents, and established normal lease relationships. Second, in handling housing cases, the court emphasized mediation (more mediation than judgments), conducted patient persuasion and education, and united both landlords and tenants. Third, it learned the method of trial following the mass line. Experience has shown that combining efforts with district public offices, going deep among the masses, and conducting on-site investigation and trial can not only handle matters more properly but also effectively improve work efficiency. However, some deviations have also occurred in handling specific cases. For example, when determining rent amounts, a few cadres mistakenly regarded the "poor man's viewpoint" as a class viewpoint, viewing the relationship between landlords and tenants as a landlord-tenant relationship, setting rents too low, and neglecting the policy of "protecting urban housing and encouraging private construction," resulting in slow resolution of cases and a backlog of over 1,000 cases.

### 京市人民法院  怎样处理房屋纠纷

　　京市人民法院
    怎样处理房屋纠纷
    【京市新闻处讯】在北京市人民法院一九四九年三月十八日至十二月三十一日的案件统计中，房屋案件占了很大的比重，计共收案二千六百零三件，占全部民事案件的百分之四十一。北京解放初期，由于一部分市民还不了解人民政府的房屋政策，以为农村平分了土地，城市也就会平分房屋；加以奸特恶意造谣，所以房屋出租人和承租人之间的关系非常混乱。去年五月十六日军管会公布解决房屋问题的布告，明确了保护房屋所有人的所有权和正当利润的取得，同时也明确了保护房客在租赁期间的正当使用。使存有房屋纠纷的当事人，扫除了思想顾虑，敢于通过诉讼来建立正常的租赁关系。因此在六、七月间房屋案件陡然上增几达一倍。
    根据人民法院十个月间所处理的一六八○件房屋案件（其中包括调解判决的九一九件，经说服撤销或停止诉讼的七六一件）中，按照纠纷的性质可分为以下几种类型：
    租赁纠纷
    第一类，房屋租赁纠纷：包括因增租、减租、转租、欠租和租约期满五种情形所引起的纠纷，共占全部案件百分之六十三。其中又以欠租纠纷最多，占二分之一。欠租纠纷大都是由于过去经过国民党反动派几次搜刮性的“币制改革”，租金已变得过低，出租人要求提高房租并拒收租金，或因过去以面粉计租，订的过高，房客拿不起，请求减租，并欠租不缴而引起的。
    所有权纠纷
    第二类，房屋所有权的纠纷：包括买卖、回赎、铺底权、首要战犯的房屋和房屋倒把等问题。这类纠纷主要的是房屋所有权未确定，或非法冒领敌产，从事房屋倒把图利，或买卖房屋时沿用旧习“典三卖四”发生欠价和交房迟延的问题，或因铺面与铺底的所有权不一致而引起争执。
    收房纠纷
    第三类，收房纠纷：房主收房，房客同意交房，但在收房过程中发生过去付出之押租（包括不合理的押租）如何偿还，搬家费索得太高，提存于伪法院租金如何折算等问题，以及房客在租赁期间对房屋修建费用之赔偿问题等。
    在处理房屋纠纷时，人民法院是根据五月十六日军管会关于房屋问题布告的保护城市房屋，奖励私人修建的基本精神，废除各种不合理的现象，如过高的押租（即超过房租一个月的押租）和“进门烂”的押租，以及租房时的种种恶习如“一茶一租一打扫”等。有的房客借“提存”伪法院、邮局、银行的租金白住房子，而房屋修建费和房产税仍由房主负担，对这一种极不合理的现象，人民政府不予承认，仍以房客欠租论。但对“提存”较多的房客，为使其经济上少受损失，把这种“提存”当作一种事实看待，在核定补交欠租时，酌量令其减少补交数额。
    租额、收房、搬家费问题
    因租额而引起的房屋纠纷，则首先尊重双方的意见，由双方自由协议，折合实物，如协议不成，则由法院根据双方经济情况及房屋的大小、好坏、位置所在地，予以适当的判决。经法院调解成立的新租赁契约或判决的赔偿，一律按实物折算，对一些长期欠租的房客，一般的也按照当时实物折算。
    对要求收房或索搬家费问题，首先根据房主收房的用途是否合乎收房条件，是否影响发展城市工商业决定，不是以搬家费为先决条件。搬家费有无和多少，则视房主房客的经济能力和住房的时间长短决定。
  二房东问题
    二房东的问题：人民政府原则上不承认二房东，因为二房东一般都是居间剥削。如果发生了纠纷，人民法院便促使房客和房主直接订立新租赁契约。
    在工作方式方法方面，人民法院曾采用过：一、法庭审判；二、赴区就审（这是结合区公所就地调查和审判）；三、集体审判：有计划地传集同类型案件的当事人，由审判员讲解政策法令，采用典型案件判决，教育和促使当事人自己进行讨论研究，解决问题。
    调解多于判决
    一年来，人民政府在保护城市房屋方面是有成绩的，首先它通过审判贯彻了军管会房屋布告精神，否定了国民党反动派的片面保护“房客”的政策，澄清了奸特的恶毒宣传，建立起正常的租赁关系；其次在处理房屋案件时，法院重视调解工作（调解多于判决），进行了耐心的说服教育，团结了主客双方；再次是学会了走群众路线的审判方法。经验证明，结合区公所，深入群众，就地调查审判，不但可以把事情办得更妥当，而且也是提高工作效率的有效办法之一。但在处理具体案件中，也曾发生一些偏差，如在核定租额时，少数干部把“穷人观点”误作阶级观点，把房主房客的关系看作地佃关系，租额订的过低，忽略了“保护城市房屋，奖励私人修建”的政策，致案件解决迟缓，积案达一千余起。
