Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th: The Lüda Democratic Women's Federation is actively assisting the Lüda Administrative Office's plan to basically eliminate illiteracy in the entire region within two years. Coordinating with the Lüda Literacy Campaign Committee, they have mobilized and organized more than half of the illiterate women in the region to participate in literacy learning. According to statistics, there are approximately 190,000 illiterate women in the Lüda region. As of October 1949, more than 129,000 women in the region had participated in literacy learning. Now, most of them can recognize four to five hundred characters, and the most advanced can recognize one thousand five to six hundred characters. Many women who previously did not know a single character have now learned to write simple letters.

Due to the long-term benighted rule of feudal forces, most women in Lüda had many doubts about literacy. Most rural women felt that learning or not learning, they still have to eat. Older women believed that they were already halfway through their lives, and there was no point in studying. Some women were also worried that they would not be able to learn and would be embarrassed. Therefore, in addition to general appeals, in-depth organizational and mobilization work was needed to encourage them to participate in literacy learning. To this end, village and neighborhood women cadres and activists went to the homes of women who were unwilling to participate in learning to persuade and mobilize them; or adopted indirect mobilization methods, appealing to young people in peasant youth schools to mobilize their wives and sisters to attend school; or directly urging husbands to mobilize their wives to attend school. Many production models or learning models in various places felt that their wives' failure to participate in learning was too backward and not beneficial to themselves or their families, so they mobilized their wives to attend school. Women cadres also patiently persuaded and educated husbands or mothers-in-law who prevented women from attending school, which yielded good results.

In the process of mobilizing women to become literate, if patient persuasion and mobilization methods were not used, but rather coercive methods were adopted, the result would inevitably be failure. For example, individual areas adopted a household registration method by the village head. At first, the women were afraid of being punished if they did not go to school, so they went to cope with it, but after a few days, they stopped going. Some areas adopted methods such as fining them light bulbs or soybean oil if they did not go to school, which also did not work. These shortcomings have been gradually corrected in the continued development of the literacy movement.

In order to enable women to concentrate on literacy learning, it is also necessary to solve various specific difficulties for women, such as taking care of children and watching the house. The Lüda Democratic Women's Federation has adopted the following effective methods:

(1) Regarding the issue of childcare: Several empty houses can be found in the village to establish simple nurseries. The Literacy Movement Committee can mobilize elderly women who are not suitable for learning to voluntarily take on the work of caring for children; or organize elderly women beyond the learning age to form childcare groups; organize young intellectual women to take care of children for women with children attending literacy classes, while helping illiterate women learn; women attending literacy classes can find their own childcare providers, or the neighborhood Literacy Movement Committee can mobilize elderly women to take care of children, with the women in school exchanging work and helping each other; mothers attending literacy classes can help each other, taking turns caring for children, or dividing into morning and evening shifts, taking turns learning and caring for children.

(2) Regarding the issue of watching the house, organize non-school-age children to watch the door at home; use the time when husbands are at home to organize women to study, etc.

Experience has proven that wherever specific difficulties for women are resolved, women actively attend school, and literacy achievements also show significant progress. For example, in Jiangxi Village, Lüshun, before the organization of nurseries, the average number of women attending school each day accounted for 60% of all students; since the organization of simple nurseries, the number of students attending school each day has reached 95%. Another example is the women's literacy class in Xiangyi Village, Xishanqu District, Dalian County. After the establishment of a simple nursery, the number of students increased from 100 to 300; the literacy achievements of women with children also improved as a result, increasing from recognizing 20 to 30 characters per month to recognizing about 100 characters.

In order to solve the problem of teaching materials for women's literacy classes, the Lüda Democratic Women's Federation published four popular readers for working women: "New Daughter's Classic," "Common Knowledge of Obstetrics," "Women's Textbook," and "How to Be a Good Member." In teaching, each women's literacy class can generally combine with the central work of the government at that time. For example, when mobilizing women to participate in production, the literacy class combines literacy with explaining the significance and importance of women's participation in labor. Last winter, the Lüda Democratic Women's Federation organized 90% of the labor force in the entire Lüda region to participate in rural winter production work. Using literacy classes to mobilize and educate played a significant role.

There are still about 70,000 illiterate women in the Lüda region who have not participated in learning. Most of these people have not yet been persuaded, and some have not been able to enroll due to objective difficulties that have not been resolved, such as livelihood problems, many children, busy housework, or illness. In the future, the Democratic Women's Federation will continue to mobilize in depth and effectively solve the specific difficulties of women's enrollment, so that women who have not yet attended school can voluntarily and actively participate in learning.

　　争取两年内基本消灭文盲
    旅大十三万文盲妇女大部已学会四五百字
    【新华社北京六日电】旅大民主妇女联合会积极协助旅大行署的两年内基本消灭全区文盲的计划，配合旅大识字运动委员会，动员和组织了全区半数以上的妇女文盲参加识字学习。据统计：旅大全区有妇女文盲约十九万人，截至一九四九年十月止，全区参加识字学习的妇女已达十二万九千余名，现在大部分都能识四五百个字，最多的识到一千五六百字。很多以前一字不识的妇女，今天已经学会了写简单的书信。
    由于过去长期地受封建势力的愚昧统治，旅大一般妇女对识字问题是有很多疑虑的。大部分农村妇女觉得学习也是吃饭，不学习也是吃饭；年纪大一些的妇女则认为自己半辈子了，念书还有啥用处；也有些妇女顾虑自己学不会，怕丢人。因此，发动她们参加识字的学习，除了一般的号召外，还需要进行深入的组织动员工作。旅大村坊妇女干部和积极分子为此都深入到不愿参加学习的妇女家中去进行说服动员工作；或采取间接动员的办法，在农民青年民校内号召他们动员自己的妻子、姊妹上学；或者直接督促丈夫动员他的妻子上学。各地有不少的生产模范或学习模范，感到自己的媳妇不参加学习，太落后了，对自己对家庭都不利，就动员自己的妻子上学。对阻拦妇女上学的丈夫或翁婆，妇女干部也耐心地进行了说服教育工作，收到很好的成效。
    在动员妇女识字的工作过程中，如果不是用耐心的说服动员的办法，而是采取强迫命令的方式，结果必然失败。如个别地区采用闾长挨户登记办法，妇女们开始时因顾虑不去上学就要受处罚，所以还去应付一下，但过几天便不去了。有的地区采用不上学就罚灯泡、豆油等办法，也行不通。这些缺点在识字运动的继续开展中都逐渐得到纠正。
    为了使妇女能安心学习识字，还必须解决妇女们的各种具体困难。如看管孩子，看家等。旅大民主妇女联合会曾采用了如下几种有效的办法：
    （一）关于看管小孩的问题：可在村里找几间空房子，创办简便托儿所，由识字运动委员会动员不适合学习年龄的老大娘自愿担任看孩子的工作；或组织超过学习年龄的老太太成立托儿小组；组织青年知识妇女，替上识字班有孩子的妇女看孩子，同时帮助文盲妇女学习；由参加识字班的妇女自己找看孩子的对象，或由坊识字运动委员会动员老太太看管，与入学的妇女换工互助；由参加识字的母亲互助，轮流看孩子，或分早晚两班，轮流学习和看孩子。
    （二）关于看家的问题，组织非学龄儿童在家里看门；利用丈夫在家的时间，组织妇女学习等。
    经验证明：凡是解决了妇女具体困难的地方，妇女就积极上学，识字成绩也有显著的进步。例如旅顺江西村，在没有组织托儿所前，每天妇女上学的平均数占全部学员的百分之六十；自从组织了简便托儿所后，每天上学的学员达百分之九十五。又如大连县西山区香一村的妇女识字班，从成立了简便托儿所后，学员由一百名增至三百名；有孩子的妇女识字成绩也因此提高，由一个月识二三十个字提高到识一百个字左右。
    为了解决妇女识字班的教材问题，旅大民主妇女联合会出版了《新女儿经》、《助产常识》、《妇女课本》、《怎样做个好会员》等四种劳动妇女通俗读本。在教学上各妇女识字班一般都能结合当时政府的中心工作。如动员妇女参加生产时，识字班便结合识字说明妇女参加劳动的意义和重要性。去年冬天旅大民主妇女联合会组织了全旅大地区百分之九十有劳动力的妇女参加农村冬季生产的工作。利用识字班进行动员和教育曾起了很大作用。
    旅大地区现在还有约七万妇女文盲没有参加学习，这些人大部分是因为思想尚未打通，也有一部分由于客观上的困难未能得到解决，如生活问题、孩子多、家务事忙或因病等原因，不能入学。今后民主妇女联合会将继续深入动员，切实解决妇女入学的具体困难，使还没有上学的妇女能自愿地积极参加学习。
