　　【Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 21st】The Worker's Cause newspaper reports that the Tito gang has taken violent coercion and terror measures against the famous Macedonian revolutionary poet Markovski. Markovski is one of the creators of the Macedonian literary language. Since the spring of 1948, Markovski has been held under unhealthy house arrest, resulting in him contracting tuberculosis and subsequently becoming paralyzed. His wife has been unemployed since 1948, her health is also very poor, and the children are suffering from hunger. Tito's agents in Macedonia are persecuting him because Markovski's poems reflect the Macedonian people's struggle against fascist enslavers and against the oppression of imperialists and capitalists. The Tito gang is attempting to physically destroy Markovski.

　　法西斯凶焰嚣张
    铁托迫害诗人
    【新华社讯】塔斯社索非亚二十一日电：工人事业报报道称：铁托伙帮对著名的马其顿革命诗人马尔科夫斯基采取暴力强制和恐怖措施。马尔科夫斯基系马其顿文学语言的创造者之一。自从一九四八年春以来，马尔科夫斯基便在有损健康的情况下被软禁起来，结果他患了肺结核病，随后又瘫痪了。他的妻子自一九四八年以来就失了业，她的身体也很不好，孩子们都在忍受饥饿。在马其顿的铁托代理人，因为马尔科夫斯基的诗反映了马其顿人民反对法西斯奴役者和反对帝国主义与资本主义者的压迫的斗争，便迫害着他。铁托伙帮企图在肉体上摧毁马尔科夫斯基。
