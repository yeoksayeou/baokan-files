　　Beijing People's Art Theatre to Strengthen Cultural and Recreational Tutoring Work

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Based on its Spring Festival work experience, the Beijing People's Art Theatre will continue to strengthen its cultural and recreational tutoring work for various factories, schools, and mass organizations. During the Spring Festival, the theatre sent many cadres to unions and mass organizations in the Inner Second and Inner Fourth Districts, as well as Mentougou, Shijingshan and other places, to provide tutoring. Special emphasis was placed on tutoring the Beijing Municipal Winter Vacation Student Art Study Class, enabling the more than 200 participating students to improve both ideologically and technically. In order to enable various mass organizations to better carry out cultural and recreational activities, the theatre will further expand its tutoring work, especially going deep into the factories.

　　京人民艺术剧院将加强文娱辅导工作
    【本报讯】北京人民艺术剧院根据春节工作经验，将继续加强对各工厂、学校、群众团体的文娱辅导工作。春节期间该院曾派出不少干部到内二、内四两区及门头沟、石景山等地的工会和群众团体中进行辅导工作。特别对京市寒假学生文艺学习班作了重点辅导，使二百多位参加学习的同学们在思想上、技术上都提高了一步。该院为了使各群众团体能更好地开展文娱活动，将进一步展开辅导工作，特别要深入到各工厂去。
