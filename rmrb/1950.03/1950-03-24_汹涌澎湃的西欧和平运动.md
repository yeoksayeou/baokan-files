　　The Surging West European Peace Movement
    By Mal'nikov, translated by Chen Youwei
    The beginning of 1950 is marked by a new upsurge in the peace movement of people of all countries in the world. In capitalist countries, the striking feature of the movement for peace is that the people are taking concrete and practical actions to oppose the war preparations of American and Western European imperialists. The working people of Western European countries are responding with practical actions to the agreements signed by the ruling blocs of Western European countries regarding American military "aid." They are refusing to produce and unload munitions that are being used to prepare for a new war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The peace advocates in capitalist countries know that the effectiveness of their efforts to fight for peace depends on the extent to which their actions for peace can be concretized and the extent to which they can call on the masses to participate. Therefore, the leaders of progressive forces in France, Italy, and other countries are calling for greater practical action to stop the war.
    In his speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Thorez called on the French working people to "organize practical actions to oppose the material preparations for an anti-Soviet war and to oppose the continuation of the war in Vietnam." On January 31, Italian Communist Senator Sereni, in a speech in Ancona, also emphasized: "Logically speaking, the struggle for peace should not be limited to assuming obligations; it must become practical and action-oriented, directly opposing the threat of war and the new massacres."
    The movement of dockworkers and other port workers refusing to unload American munitions is the most vivid manifestation of the concrete and effective form taken by the working class and all working people in their struggle against the preparations for a new war. This is in no way similar to the futile accusations and pacifist appeals of the leaders of pseudo-socialists (who have tried to limit the peace movement by this). The warriors for peace and democracy know that only the participation of all the people without exception in the actions of the struggle for peace, only the desire of hundreds of millions of people for peace turning into united concrete actions to crush the plans of the aggressors, can stop the activities of this group of crazy warmongers.
    The movement initiated by French dockworkers and other port workers refusing to unload American munitions is of great significance for the struggle for peace waged by the working people of Western European countries. The dockworkers of Saint-Nazaire were the first to announce their decision to refuse to unload American munitions. This was followed by dockworkers and sailors in the ports of Marseille, Bordeaux, Lorraine, Nantes, La Rochelle, Dunkirk, Le Havre, Cherbourg, and North Africa. In these ports, workers have formed "Joint Action Committees" to coordinate the actions of peace advocates in French cities.
    The joint action of dockworkers in Le Havre and Dunkirk and railway workers in Lille (part of the Artois region) is an excellent example. A trainload of war materials, which had been refused by dockworkers in Le Havre and Dunkirk to be loaded onto ships bound for Vietnam, was intended by the French authorities to be rerouted elsewhere. However, when the train stopped at the Lille station en route, the local railway workers prevented it from being transferred to other seaports.
    The dockworkers and other port workers in France are supported by the broad masses of the people. Funds have been raised nationwide to assist the dockworkers of Saint-Nazaire, who have been unemployed for several months but are still determined to refuse to unload war materials. The courageous struggle of the dockworkers, sailors, and other workers in France is an inspiring example for all peace fighters in capitalist countries.
    The movement initiated by French dockworkers and other workers has been warmly echoed by the working people in Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and other capitalist countries. In Italy, workers in Ancona and Genoa immediately responded to the movement initiated by the dockworkers of Saint-Nazaire, France. Then dockworkers in Ligurian coastal ports such as La Spezia, Imperia and Savona, Naples, Venice, and other cities also joined. Peace advocates in Livorno held a large-scale demonstration. The dockworkers and other workers of the city, following the example of the workers of Ancona, Genoa, and other ports, refused to unload war materials in the port. In early February, all the workers in the ports along the Ligurian coast, together with the leaders of their national trade union federation and the opposition in parliament, held a meeting in Genoa. The decisions made at this meeting demonstrated the workers' unwavering determination to refuse to unload American "aid" in the form of munitions to Italy.
    Dockworkers in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Zaanstad also joined the movement, refusing to unload American military aid to the Netherlands, and called on all Dutch port workers to follow their example. Dockworkers in other Dutch ports responded to this call. Workers in Dutch shipping companies, in response to the call of workers in the three largest ports in the Netherlands, firmly declared: "We support the movement initiated by the dockworkers; for the sake of our families, wives, and children, we need peace, bread, and happiness. That is why we demand a halt to the unloading of American munitions shipped to the Netherlands under the aggressive Atlantic Pact."
    The resolute and courageous actions of port workers, dockworkers, and sailors in Saint-Nazaire, Dunkirk, Ancona, Genoa, Amsterdam, and many other seaports in Western European countries are a response to the new acts of aggression by warmongers in Western European countries. The signing of the U.S. military aid to Europe agreement in Washington, the passage of U.S. strategic plans by the so-called North Atlantic Alliance Committee, and the aggressive statements by leading figures in the U.S. ruling bloc—President Truman, Defense Secretary Johnson, Secretary of State Acheson, and others—all indicate that the danger of war has recently increased.
    The working people of Western Europe and the world are responding to these acts of aggression by intensifying their struggle for peace.
    More importantly, practical action has generally become the basic form of struggle for peace-loving people in opposing the instigators of a new world war. This form of struggle promotes the unity of peace advocates and enhances the vigilance and combat effectiveness of the anti-imperialist camp. The anti-imperialist camp, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, unswervingly and consistently defends democracy, and safeguards the peace and security of the people.

　　汹涌澎湃的西欧和平运动
    马尔尼科夫作  陈有为译
    一九五○年的开始，是以世界各国人民争取和平运动的新高涨为标志的。在资本主义国家中，争取和平运动的显著的特点，就是人民以具体的与实际的行动来反对美国与西欧帝国主义者的准备战争。西欧各国的劳动人民，以实际的行动来回答西欧诸国统治集团所签订的关于美国军火“援助”的协定。他们拒绝生产与卸运那些用来准备进行侵略苏联与人民民主国家的新战争的军火。
    资本主义国家中的和平拥护者知道，他们为和平而斗争的努力之效果，是取决于他们的争取和平的行动能具体化到什么程度，能号召群众参加到什么范围。因此法国、意大利与其他国家的进步力量的领袖们，就号召以更大的实际的行动来制止战争。
    多列士在法共中央委员会全会上的演说中，号召法国劳动人民“组织实际的行动来反对反苏战争之物质上的准备，并反对继续在越南战争”。一月三十一日，意大利共产党参议员塞兰尼在安科纳演说时，也着重地指出：“照理讲，争取和平的斗争绝不是止于担负义务而已；必须变成为直接反对战争威胁、反对新屠杀的实际与行动”。
    码头工人与别的港口工人们拒绝卸运美国军火的运动，是工人阶级与所有的劳动人民进行反对新战争准备的斗争所采取的具体有效的形式的最生动的表现。这与伪社会主义者的领袖们的徒然的责言及和平主义的请求（他们曾经企图以此来限制和平运动）是毫无相同之点。和平与民主的战士们知道，只有全体人民一无例外地参加争取和平斗争的行动，只有亿万广大的人民争取和平的想望变成为团结具体的行动以粉碎侵略者的计划，才能制止这一批疯狂的战争贩子的活动。
    由法国码头工人与别的港口工人所发动的拒绝卸运美国军火的运动，对于西欧各国劳动人民进行争取和平的斗争，有着重大的意义。首先宣布拒绝卸运美国军火决定的是圣那最尔的码头工人。接着响应的就是马赛、波尔多、洛林、南特、罗舍尔、敦刻尔克、哈佛尔、瑟堡与北非洲各港口的码头工人与海员。在这些港口中，工人们已组成了“联合行动委员会”，使法国各城市的和平拥护者的行动能互相配合。
    哈佛尔与敦刻尔克的码头工人与里泰尔（阿台区的一部分）铁路工人的联合行动就是一个极好的例子。已被哈佛尔与敦刻尔克码头工人所拒绝装上轮船运往越南的一车战争物资，法国当局想把这一列车改开他处，但当列车途中停留在里泰尔站的时候，该地的铁路工人就阻止它将这一列车物资转运到别的海口去。
    法国的码头工人与其他港口工人受到广大人民的支持。全国已在募集基金来援助圣那最尔的码头工人，他们虽然已失业达几个月仍坚决地拒绝卸运战争物资。法国码头工人、海员与其他工人们勇敢的斗争，对于资本主义各国中所有的和平斗士们，是一个具有鼓舞作用的榜样。
    法国码头工人与其他工人们所发起的运动，已为意大利、荷兰、比利时、挪威与其他各资本主义国家内的劳动人民所热烈响应。在意大利，安科纳与热那亚的工人立刻响应了法国圣那最尔码头工人所发起的运动。于是力古利安沿岸的港口如斯培西亚、英比利亚与萨瓦那、那不勒斯、威尼斯与其他城市的码头工人也参加了。利伏诺的和平拥护者举行了一次大规模的示威游行。该市的码头工人与别的工人，跟着安科纳、热那亚与其他口岸的工人的榜样，拒绝卸运在该港的战争物资。二月初，力古利安沿岸港口所有的工人，与他们的全国工会联合会的领袖和议会中的反对派在热那亚举行了一次会议。这次会议所作出的决定，表明了工人们拒绝卸运美国“援助”意大利军火的不可动摇的决心。
    阿姆斯特丹、鹿特丹与泽丹的码头工人，也参加了这个运动，拒绝卸运美国“援”荷的军火，并号召全荷兰的港口工人一致照他们的榜样。荷兰其他港口的码头工人们响应了这个号召。荷兰航运公司的工人，在响应荷兰三个最大港口的工人的号召时，他们坚决的宣称：“我们支持码头工人所发起的运动；为了我们的家庭与妻儿我们需要和平、面包与幸福。这就是我们为何要求停止卸运侵略性的大西洋公约中所规定的美国输至荷兰的军火。”
    圣那最尔、敦刻尔克、安科纳、热那亚、阿姆斯特丹与许多其他西欧各国海港的港口工人、码头工人与海员们的坚决与勇敢的行动，是对西欧各国战争贩子们新侵略行动之答复。华盛顿的美国军火援欧协定之签字，所谓北大西洋联盟的委员会之通过美国战略计划，美国的统治集团领导人物——总统杜鲁门、国防部长詹森、国务卿艾奇逊与别的人们——的侵略主义的声明，所有这些都表示战争危险近来已增长了。
    西欧与世界各国的劳动人民，就以加紧他们争取和平的斗争，来回答这些侵略的行动。
    尤有进者，实际的行动已经普遍地成为和平的热爱者在反对新世界大战挑拨者时的基本的斗争形式了。这种斗争的形式，促进了和平拥护者们的团结，提高了反帝国主义阵营的警惕性与战斗性。反帝国主义阵营在苏联领导之下，不屈不挠地始终一贯地保卫着民主，维护着人民的和平与安全。
