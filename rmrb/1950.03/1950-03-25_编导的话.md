　　Director's Words

    When the Huabei University Arts Troupe No. 3 was reorganized into the Chinese People's University Arts Troupe, we received instructions from President Cheng to perform a play with the theme of "Sino-Soviet Friendship" upon the establishment of the new "Chinese People's University," because the school's main task was to cultivate talents for the construction of New China, and "learning from the Soviet Union" was one of the important topics in construction.
    This topic was very large and broad, especially to write such a subject into a dramatic form in a very short time, which was a difficult task for us. In order to facilitate the collection of materials, I went to the Northeast on January 10th and stayed in Shenyang for two days. The result was that this problem had been basically solved, and a hot new record creation movement was unfolding. So I went to Dalian, and only in the Changchun Railway Factory did I find some materials about "Soviet Comrades in China." After two weeks of visits and research, I was fortunate to receive assistance from the administration, Party, Youth League, and trade union of the Railway Factory in various aspects. They valued this work as much as they valued their own work, especially the worker comrades. In addition to talking late into the night every day, they even talked about everything they knew during their lunch breaks. On the night I left, a worker comrade even ran a long way to the station and asked me very caringly: "...Is there anything you are not clear about? We can't express ourselves well and haven't told you everything we know, I'm afraid we can't help you complete the task..." Their sincere enthusiasm and attention to literary and artistic work surprised me and gave me unparalleled encouragement and strength.
    I returned to Beijing at the end of January. The comrades in the troupe went to the Changxindian Railway Factory to study in preparation for rehearsing this play, and only returned to the troupe on February 11th. In this gap, I hastily wrote the script, and it was completely finished on the 14th. During this writing time, I felt the workers' hopes and encouragement for me at all times. At the same time, I also felt the comrades' help and care, which shared a lot of my piecemeal work, allowing me to get fourteen or fifteen hours of writing time every day. At the same time, they constantly provided me with some relevant material documents and discussions, which increased my confidence, courage, and methods to complete the task.
    After the comrades finished their summary of going to the factory, they discussed the script, and the Art Committee also initially read the script. The revision and mimeographing were completed on the 18th before rehearsals began.
    In deciding on roles and rehearsals, we also encountered many difficulties. Because most of our troupe members graduated from political classes, they had no foundation in business, were young, and had little time. We planned to perform when the school started, so we had to do everything possible to "catch up with the task." Sure enough, many active comrades appeared at the mobilization meeting before the work began, launching a challenge competition to create new records, and setting many covenants and plans. Most of the comrades were able to memorize the lines the day after receiving the script, analyze the thoughts and feelings of each unit's purpose of the role, and conduct detailed rehearsals. At the same time, they also demonstrated a high degree of creativity and mutual assistance in the actors' mutual aid groups. They also gained a lot from those studies, exercises, and connections with the factory life experience. Therefore, we were able to hold the first dress rehearsal on March 11 as scheduled, and received guidance from the leaders of the school, the Ministry of Culture, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Drama Academy, which were modified before today's performance.
    Because our study of "internationalism" is still very insufficient, and our research on the issue of Sino-Soviet friendship is still very poor, we inevitably handle such a theme of criticizing old, conservative empiricism and narrow nationalism, learning internationalism, improving class consciousness, and using the proletarian ideological methods, viewpoints, and positions to view Sino-Soviet relations in a very superficial or even inappropriate way, but we are confident that we have the determination to humbly learn and demand improvement. Therefore, we warmly hope that comrades and gentlemen can give us frank criticism, so that this play can still play a role in the construction of our New China.

　　编导的话
    李超
    当华大文工三团结束改成中国人民大学文工团时，接到成校长的指示要在新的“中国人民大学”成立时演出一个“中苏友好”内容的戏，因为学校主要的任务是培养新中国的建设人材，而在建设中“向苏联学习”又是重要课题之一。
    这题目很大又很广泛，尤其是把这样一个题材通过戏剧形式在很短的时间写出来，在我们是一件困难的事。为便于收集材料，于一月十日到东北去，在沈阳住了两天，得到的结果是这问题基本上已经解决了，而正在展开火热的创造新纪录运动中，于是到大连去，在中长路铁路机厂才找到了些关于“苏联同志在中国”的材料，经过两个星期的访问研究，幸亏得到铁路机厂行政、党、团、工会，在各方面的帮助，他们重视这一工作像重视他们自己的工作一样，尤其是工人同志们，除了每天晚上谈到深夜外，甚至连中午吃饭的时间，他们还在讲述着他们知道的一切。当我离开的那夜晚还有个工人同志老远的跑到车站上很关心的问我：“……你还有什么不清楚的吗？我们不会说话还没有把我们知道的都告诉你，怕不能帮你完成任务……”他们这种真挚的热情和对文艺工作的重视，使我惊奇，也给我无比的鼓舞和力量。
    在一月底回到了北京，团里的同志为了准备排这个戏，到长辛店铁路机厂去学习，到二月十一日才回团，就在这个空当里我草草的写好了这个剧本，到十四号算是完全脱稿了。在这写作的时间里时时刻刻的感到工人同志们对我的希望和鼓励，同时也感到同志们对我的帮助和照顾，分担了我很多零星工作，使我每天能得到十四五个钟头的写作时间，同时更不断的供给我一些有关这体材的素材文件和讨论，使我增加了完成任务的信心勇气和办法。
    同志们作完了下工厂的总结后，讨论了这剧本，艺术委员会也初步的读完了这剧本，连修改油印到十八号才开始排练。
    在决定角色和排练上，我们也同样存在着不少困难，因为我们团成员多半是从政治班毕业出来的同志，在业务上既无基础年龄又轻而且时间很短、打算在学校开课时演出，所以就不能不想尽一切办法来“赶任务”。果然在这工作开始前的动员会上出现了不少积极同志，发动了挑战竞赛创造新纪录的运动，订下了不少公约和计划。大半同志在接到剧本的第二天就能把台词背下来，分析角色每个单元目的的思想感情进行细排，同时在演员的互助小组中也发挥了高度的创造和互助精神，从那些研究练习与联系下工厂的生活体验上也收获了不少，所以我们能够如期的在三月十一日举行了初次彩排得到了学校和文化部、中苏友协以及戏剧学院的首长们的指导，加以修改才有今天的演出。
    由于我们对“国际主义”的学习还非常不够，对中苏友好的问题还研究的很差，所以免不了把这样一个批判旧的保守的经验主义和狭隘的民族主义思想学习国际主义提高阶级觉悟用无产阶级的思想方法观点立场来看中苏关系的主题，处理的很肤浅甚至不当，但是我们自信我们有虚心学习与要求改进的决心。所以我们热望同志们先生们能给我们不客气的指正，使这个戏还能在咱这新中国的建设中起一点作用。
