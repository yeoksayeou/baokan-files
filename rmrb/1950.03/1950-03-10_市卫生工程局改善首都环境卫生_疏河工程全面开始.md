　　Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau Improves Capital's Environmental Sanitation
　　River Dredging Project Fully Underway

　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau has formulated a work plan for dredging rivers and lakes throughout the city this year. This is part of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's municipal construction plan for this year. This plan has been approved by the Second Session of the Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference, and the bureau is now fully launching the work according to the plan.

　　The river and lake system of Beijing originates from Yuquan Mountain. One branch passes through the North Long River, Kunming Lake, and Long River; the other branch passes through the Jin River and merges with the Long River outside Xizhimen. Part of it enters the city and is distributed in Shichahai and the Three Seas, and part of it surrounds the city as the moat. Finally, it converges outside Dongbianmen and enters the Tonghui River (i.e., the Grain Transport River). As a result of the long-term reactionary rule of the enemy and puppets, these rivers and lakes have been silted up for many years, the sluice gates are in disrepair, the water volume is insufficient, mosquitoes are breeding, and they are dirty and unbearable, seriously damaging the health of the people of Beijing. Based on this situation, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau plans to dredge a total of 62,321 meters of the Jin River, Long River, Tongzi River, Jade Belt River, and the moat this year, and excavate Beihai, Zhonghai, and Nanhai to make them a complete river and lake system. In addition, efforts will be made to develop water sources to ensure water supply. In order to complete the huge project of dredging the Three Seas before the rainy season, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau has completed the dredging of the drainage canal of the Three Seas from the Rizhige Gate through Zhongshan Park, Tiananmen, to the east end of Changpu River, and the river section from outside Dongbianmen to Qingfeng Gate. Starting from the first of this month, the dredging project of the moat section inside Dongbianmen to the east of Qianmen Water Gate (Yuhe Dark Ditch Entrance) will also begin, so as to facilitate the drainage after the dredging project of the Three Seas begins. As for the work of developing water sources, in addition to dredging the spring pool in Yuquan Mountain, the bureau plans to drill ten machine wells along the Jin River and Long River. After the machine well project is completed, the daily water output can reach 24,000 cubic meters, plus the regulation of water storage in Kunming Lake, the water supply problem during the dry season in June can be solved. After the water supply is sufficient, the part of the sewer that still injects into the moat of Qian Sanmen can be flushed in time, solving the worry of water accumulation and corrosion. In addition, in order to flexibly dispatch the water volume, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau also plans to repair old sluice gates or rebuild new-style sluice gates.

　　市卫生工程局改善首都环境卫生
    疏河工程全面开始
    【北京讯】京市人民政府卫生工程局已制定本年度疏浚全市河道湖泊的工作计划。这是北京市人民政府今年度市政建设计划中的一部分。此计划业经各界人民代表会议第二届第二次会议通过，该局现已根据计划全面展开工作。
    京市河湖水系发源于玉泉山，一支经北长河、昆明湖和长河；一支经金河于西直门外和长河会合后，一部入城分布于什刹海及三海，一部环城为护城河，最后又于东便门外会合，入通惠河（即运粮河）。由于敌伪长期反动统治的结果，多年以来这些河湖就已淤塞，闸门失修，水量不足，蚊虫繁殖，肮脏不堪，严重地损害着京市人民的健康。卫生工程局根据此种情况，拟于今年将金河、长河、筒子河、玉带河及护城河共长六万二千三百二十一公尺全部疏浚，并掏挖北海、中海、南海，使成为一完善的河湖系统。此外，并设法开发水源，保证供水。卫生工程局为了争取在雨季以前完成疏浚三海的浩大工程，已将由日知阁闸经中山公园、天安门、至菖蒲河东头段的三海排水渠及东便门外至庆丰闸段河道疏浚完了。本月一日起并开始前三门护城河东便门内至前门迤东水关（御河暗沟口）段的疏浚工程，以便于三海疏浚工程开始后易于泄水。至开发水源的工作，该局除疏浚玉泉山泉池外，拟在金河、长河沿岸，凿机井十座。凿机井工程完成后，每日出水量可达二万四千立方公尺，再加上昆明湖蓄水的调剂，六月枯水期的供水问题当可获得解决。供水充足后对部分下水道仍注入前三门护城河的，可以按时冲刷，解决了积水腐蚀之虑。此外为了调度水量灵活，卫生工程局并计划整修旧有水闸或改建新式闸水。
