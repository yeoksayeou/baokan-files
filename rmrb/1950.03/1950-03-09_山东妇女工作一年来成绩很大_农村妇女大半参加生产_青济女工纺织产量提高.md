Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th: Shandong Province's women's work has greatly developed in the past year. More than 90% of the cities and counties in the province have established women's organizations. One of the central contents of Shandong's women's work is to mobilize and organize women to participate in production. In rural areas, women have become an indispensable force in agricultural production. According to statistics, 60% to 70% of women in Shandong participate in agricultural production. Many of them have learned production techniques and are responsible for the main labor. In fifteen counties in the Lunan District, more than 9,600 women have learned seed soaking techniques. In Jiaodong, women who are responsible for the main labor in the autumn harvest account for 30% to 40%. Last year, several areas of Shandong suffered from floods, droughts, and insect pests, and women's contributions to production and disaster relief were enormous. For example, in Dezhou County, Bohai District, more than 55,000 women participated in fighting cotton aphids; many women in Jinan City and Bohai District directly participated in the Yellow River control project; and women in 26 counties in the Lunan District also dried 48.65 million catties of dried vegetables in preparation for weathering the famine. In addition, a considerable number of women in various places participated in sideline production such as cotton ginning, wool spinning, and fish basket weaving. The role of female workers in urban factories in production has also been demonstrated in various places. For example, in Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory, the output of cloth woven by female workers in September last year exceeded the highest record during the Kuomintang rule and the Japanese occupation. In Qingdao No. 9 Textile Factory, female workers used to produce more than 100 catties of waste cotton per day in the drawing process, but now it has been reduced to 20 catties. Most of the female workers have joined the trade union, with more than 95% in Jinan and 80% in Qingdao. In addition, many urban women's federations also launched production groups for poor working women last year, making military uniforms, shoes, socks, and repairing waterways, using work-for-relief methods to solve the livelihood problems of some poor working women. Some places organized temporary clothing factories last winter. In Jinan and Qingdao alone, 6,000 street family women participated in the production of temporary clothing factories. Yantai City has organized women to embroider, make lace, and weave hairnets through cooperatives, which has also solved the livelihood difficulties of some women.

            Attention to Protecting Women's Rights and Strengthening Maternal and Child Health Welfare

    Protecting women from feudal persecution and increasing maternal and child health welfare are also important contents of Shandong's women's work. Women in Shandong have suffered heavily from feudal oppression. Until last year, according to statistics from ten counties in the Bohai District in half a year, as many as 140 women committed suicide or were killed. Last August, the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation made a strict self-criticism at a meeting of women cadres for the past shortcomings in not paying enough attention to this issue, and made special discussions and arrangements. Since then, various places and relevant departments have gradually attached importance to this issue. According to statistics from two cities and eight counties in the Lunan District, 221 cases of protecting women's rights have been resolved successively. The Provincial Women's Federation and other relevant departments have also paid more attention to maternal and child welfare work than in the past. The number of nurseries in the province has increased from 16 to 40, including 10 factory nurseries. Now, except for the No. 6 Textile Factory, which has no statistics, the remaining nurseries have accommodated 877 children. Midwife training institutes have been held in rural areas to gradually improve rural women's health work. In addition, Jinan City, through the textile trade union representative meeting, also specifically stipulated the handling methods for female workers' illness, menstrual leave, and childbirth issues. The Municipal Trade Union has established a female workers' hospital. Qingdao and Jinan factories have also generally abolished the body search system for female workers.

    In addition, the women's federations in some cities also carry out education and publicity work for women. For example, after the women's representatives conference in Qingdao, it used forums, lectures and other methods to conduct policy and situation education for women from all walks of life; and published the "New Qingdao Women" bi-monthly. Xuzhou City organized health lectures in the Nurses Association to explain women's health issues. Yantai used training classes, remedial classes, etc. to unite some unemployed and out-of-school women and female medical staff, and conducted political and professional education for them.

    The main shortcomings of Shandong's women's work in the past year are that in organizing rural women and urban family working women to produce, many cadres have neglected the actual situation. Instead of how to organize and lead them under the existing living conditions, they simply hoped to immediately open factories in the cities and restore the manual weaving that had been effective in the past but has now been replaced by urban machine production in the countryside, thus reducing the due effect of organizing women to participate in production due to impracticality. Regarding maternal and child welfare work, many places have not fully paid attention to it. The above-mentioned shortcomings are being gradually corrected by Shandong Women's Federation organizations.

### 山东妇女工作一年来成绩很大  农村妇女大半参加生产  青济女工纺织产量提高

　　山东妇女工作一年来成绩很大
    农村妇女大半参加生产
    青济女工纺织产量提高
    【新华社济南八日电】山东省的妇女工作一年来有很大的发展。全省现已有百分之九十以上的市、县建立了妇女组织。山东妇女工作的中心内容之一是发动和组织妇女参加生产。在农村，妇女已成为农业生产中一支不可轻视的力量。据统计，山东各地有百分之六十至七十的妇女参加了农业生产。其中不少妇女学会了生产技术担负了主要劳动。在鲁中南区十五个县中，即有九千六百多个妇女学会了浸种。胶东妇女在秋收秋种中，担负主要劳动的妇女占百分之三十到四十。去年山东若干地区遭受水旱虫等灾害，妇女在生产救灾中的贡献是巨大的。如渤海区德平县即有五万五千多妇女参加打绵虫；济南市和渤海区的不少妇女并直接参加了治黄工程；鲁中南二十六个县的妇女还晒了四千八百六十五万斤干菜，准备渡荒。此外各地妇女参加弹棉花、纺羊毛、编鱼篓等副业生产的为数亦不少。城市工厂中女工们在生产中的作用，亦已在各地显示出来。如济南仁丰纱厂，去年九月份女工织布的产量，就超过国民党统治和日寇时期的最高纪录。青岛中纺九厂女工过去并条每天出废棉一百多斤，现已减至二十斤。女工们大部分参加了工会，在济南有百分之九十五以上，在青岛也有百分之八十。此外许多城市中妇联会去年还发动贫苦家庭劳动妇女组织生产小组，做军衣、鞋、袜和修水道，用以工代赈的办法，解决了部分贫苦家庭妇女的生活问题。有的地方在去年冬季组织了临时被服厂。仅济南、青岛两地，参加临时被服厂生产的即有六千个街道家庭妇女。烟台市曾通过合作社组织妇女绣花、作花边、织发网等，也解决了部分妇女的生活困难。
            注意保障妇女权利  加强妇婴卫生福利
    保障妇女不再受封建迫害与增进妇婴卫生福利工作，亦是山东妇女工作的重要内容之一。山东妇女受封建压迫很重，直到去年为止，据渤海区十个县半年中的统计，自杀和被害的妇女竟有一百四十人。去年八月省民主妇女联合会在妇女干部会议上曾对过去对此问题重视不够的缺点作了严格的自我批评，并作了专门的讨论和布置。此后，各地和有关部门对这一问题即逐渐重视。据鲁中南区二个市、八个县的统计，已先后解决了保护妇女权利的问题二百二十一件。省妇联会及其他有关部门对妇婴福利工作亦较过去重视。全省托儿所已由十六所增加至四十所，内工厂托儿所有十所。现除中纺六所无统计外，其余各所已收容儿童八百七十七名。在农村中曾举办产婆训练所，以逐步改进农村妇女卫生工作。除此，济南市通过纺织工会代表会议，还具体规定了女工生病、例假、生育等问题的处理办法。市工会已办了一所女工医院。青岛、济南工厂并已普遍废除了对女工的检身制度。
    此外，有些城市的妇联会还对妇女进行教育宣传工作。如青岛市在各界妇女代表会议后，利用座谈会、讲演等方式，向各界妇女进行政策和形势教育；并出版了《新青岛妇女》半月刊。徐州市在护士学会中组织了卫生演讲，讲解妇女卫生问题。烟台用办训练班、补习班等方式，团结了一些失业失学妇女和女医务人员，对她们进行了政治和业务教育。
    一年来山东妇女工作的主要缺点是在组织农村妇女及城市家庭劳动妇女生产问题上，许多干部忽略了实际情况，不是如何在原有的生活条件下加以组织领导，而是单纯地希望在城市中马上开办工厂，在农村中恢复过去曾有效果而现在已为城市机器生产所代替了的手工纺织，因而使组织妇女参加生产的工作因不切实际而减低了应有效果。关于妇婴福利工作，不少地方尚未充分予以重视。上述缺点正经山东妇联组织逐步注意纠正中。
