Strengthen the Work of Eliminating Traitors and Counter-revolutionaries
    Li Zhuang

    The cracking of the Chiang Kai-shek gang's spy case by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau on February 26 once again illustrates the fact that the Kuomintang spies' sabotage of New China is becoming increasingly tense and acute; our task of fighting the enemy on the hidden front is becoming increasingly meticulous and complex. Under the rule of the people's democratic government, there is no room for spies to stand. The public security organs of the people's governments at all levels resolutely implement the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which states "It is necessary to suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause, as well as other incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders," and have devoted great efforts to eliminating traitors and counter-revolutionaries. In the past year alone, our public security organs in major cities such as Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Qiqihar, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Guilin, Chengdu, Taiyuan, Fuzhou, and Dihua have cracked more than 50 secret Kuomintang radio stations. In June of last year in Shenyang, the People's Government Public Security Bureau skillfully cracked a huge American spy case headed by the Japanese Sasaki; recently in Shanghai, the People's Government Public Security Bureau quickly arrested and, with the approval of the Military Control Commission, executed Luo Binggan, the chief Kuomintang bandit spy who directed air raids on targets for the bandits' planes; in other cities and vast rural areas throughout the country, many special agents and bandits have been successively arrested. This means that the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agents lurking in and dispatched to the mainland are being subjected to destructive blows, and the people's democratic order has been established and is being consolidated throughout the country.

    However, as Chairman Mao instructed us long ago: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will attempt to restore [their power] in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." After suffering destructive blows, the special agent bandits have by no means ceased their activities, but have adopted more cunning ways of lurking and concealing themselves. They changed their names, disguised themselves in various ways, infiltrated religious superstitious groups, and even penetrated our interior to gather intelligence and spread rumors. For example, the bandit Ji Zhaoxiang, who was recently arrested in Beijing, infiltrated the epidemic prevention team and used the name of epidemic prevention to gather various intelligence information. Once the time is ripe, these lurking and concealed special agent bandits will carry out various acts of sabotage: burning factories, blowing up railways, poisoning and assassinating, and so on. Beijing and Northeast China, among other places, have experienced many sabotage incidents by special agents. After their faces have been exposed and they cannot hide or lurk anymore, the special agent bandits flee to mountainous areas and rural areas (especially new areas), or become political bandits, attacking government agencies, killing, arson, and robbery, or use the weaknesses of the government's work and the lack of political experience of some backward masses to create rumors, incite incidents, and disrupt social order. Recently, both the US and Chiang Kai-shek officials have publicly announced that they will "strengthen their understanding of Communist China" and "strengthen their enemy rear work against the Communist Party," which is the enemy's confession of preparing to strengthen special agent sabotage and deserves our serious vigilance.

    It should be pointed out that losing vigilance and ignoring the activities of special agents is terrible, but as long as we raise our vigilance, the activities of special agents under the supervision of the people are not terrible. We already have an effective public security agency to deal with these heinous special agents. The arrest of the bandit Ji Zhaoxiang this time is a vivid and educational example. The Beijing Public Security Bureau conducted a thorough investigation of the Ji bandit's situation, gaining insights into all the enemy's activities. Then, with the strong help of the people, the enemy was accurately struck with swift action, and the masterminds and accomplices of this spy case were all arrested. The American-made radio, pistol, and various documents used by the Ji bandit were all seized on the spot, and the special agents were speechless and pleaded guilty. So, where is the problem now? The problem is that there are quite a few people who, consciously or unconsciously, think: mainland China has been basically liberated, the revolution has been successful, the world is at peace, and the remaining few special agents are just clowns jumping around, so they can rest easy. As a result, some staff members of the agency have relaxed their attention to keeping state secrets, and they casually reveal secrets in conversations, phone calls, and letters. They are careless about the receipt, dispatch, transfer, and safekeeping of documents. Staff members of an agency in Beijing even lost their document bags when buying things in the market. Some factories and enterprises neglect security work, important machines are unguarded, and anyone is allowed to enter and spy at will. Some of the people, because they have not been educated in anti-espionage, do not report suspicious people and events to the relevant authorities, and do not get to the bottom of rumors. If these phenomena are allowed to continue, then our construction cause will suffer many unnecessary and serious losses.

    In order to support the revolutionary war to finally eliminate the Kuomintang remnant bandits, consolidate the revolutionary order, and complete the major task of economic construction, in addition to the public security organs continuing to work hard, the broad masses of people should also be mobilized to actively support this struggle. It is necessary to explain to cadres and the masses: Special agents are spying on us and sabotaging us at any time and any place, and we cannot be paralyzed in the slightest; as long as everyone is vigilant and takes necessary measures, and everyone participates in the work of eliminating traitors and counter-revolutionaries, special agents will definitely be eliminated. In organs, troops, and factories, a set of security work systems should be established, a habit of keeping state secrets should be cultivated, suspicious elements should be investigated, and those who have contributed to or made mistakes in the anti-special agent struggle should be rewarded or punished. The publicity and education of the people should be strengthened so that they understand that eliminating traitors and counter-revolutionaries is their own business and an important task to protect their lives and property. Powerful publicity, coupled with appropriate organizational work, will attract the people to the anti-espionage struggle.

    For special agents, we still adopt the policy of "the ringleaders must be dealt with, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." For special agents who recognize that the final demise of Chiang Kai-shek is imminent and do not want to be buried with Chiang Kai-shek, they are allowed to repent and start anew, report and register with the public security organs, and the People's Government will certainly give them a way to start anew. Among them, those who report bandit situations or assist the People's Government in handling major cases with merit will certainly be allowed by the People's Government to offset their crimes with meritorious service and will be rewarded. For the ringleaders who are obsessed and stubborn to the end and resolutely hostile to the people, the People's Government will certainly give them severe suppression. Suppression is not empty talk. The arrest of the Ji bandit is a clear example.

### 加强锄奸反特工作

　　加强锄奸反特工作
    李庄
    北京市人民政府公安局二月二十六日破获的蒋匪间谍特务案，再一次说明了这样一个事实，即蒋匪间谍对于新中国的特务破坏，越来越紧张越尖锐；我们在隐蔽战线上对敌斗争的任务，越来越细致越复杂了。在人民民主政权统治下，是不容许特务分子立足的。各地人民政府公安机关坚决执行人民政治协商会议共同纲领中“必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子”的规定，用很大力量进行了锄奸反特工作。仅去年一年中我公安机关在上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、济南、青岛、汉口、桂林、成都、太原、福州、迪化等大城市，破获蒋匪秘密潜伏电台达五十余部之多。去年六月在沈阳，人民政府公安机关巧妙地破获了巨大的以日人佐佐木为首的美国间谍案；最近在上海，人民政府公安机关迅速地逮捕了并经军管会批准处决了替匪机指示轰炸目标的国民党匪帮特务首恶罗炳干；在全国其他城市及广大农村中，均有不少特务匪徒相继落网。这就是说：国民党匪帮潜伏在和派遣到大陆上的特务分子，正在遭受着歼灭性的打击，在全国范围内，人民民主秩序已经确立，并且正在巩固着。
    但是，正如毛主席早就指示我们的：“帝国主义和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要放松自己的警惕性。”特务匪徒们在遭受歼灭打击之后，他们绝没有停止活动，而是采取了更巧妙的潜伏隐蔽活动的方式。他们改名换姓，多方伪装，混入宗教迷信团体，甚至打入我们内部，刺探情报，散布谣言。例如最近在北京被捕的计兆祥匪徒，他就曾经钻入防疫队内，利用防疫名义，刺探各种情报。一旦时机成熟，这些潜伏隐蔽的特务匪徒就进行各种破坏活动：焚烧工厂，爆破铁路，放毒刺杀等等。北京和东北等地，已经发生过不少特务破坏事件。特务匪徒在其面目已经暴露，无法潜伏隐蔽之后，就逃到山地和农村（特别是新区），或则成为政治土匪，袭击政府机关，杀人放火，拦路行劫，或则利用政府工作的弱点和一部分落后群众的没有政治经验，制造谣言，煽动事变，扰乱社会秩序。最近，美蒋官方都公开宣布要“加强对于共产党中国的了解”、“加强对于共产党的敌后工作”，这就是敌人准备加强特务破坏的自供，值得我们严重警惕。
    应该指出：丧失警惕性，忽视特务活动是可怕的，但是只要我们提高警惕性，那么，在人民监视下的特务活动并不是可怕的。我们已经有了一个有效的公安机构来对付这些罪恶滔天的特务分子。这次计匪兆祥的被捕就是一个生动而有教育意义的例子。北京公安机关对于计匪的情况进行了周密的调查，洞悉敌人一切活动情况。然后在人民群众有力地帮助之下，以敏捷的行动，准确地打击敌人，使这个特务案的主、从犯全部落网。计匪使用的美造电台、手枪及各种文件均被当场搜出，特务分子们哑口无言，低头服罪。那么，现在的问题在那里呢？问题在于有不少的一部分人，他们在思想上有意无意地认为：中国大陆已经基本解放，革命已经成功，天下已经太平，剩下几个特务不过是小丑跳梁，满可以高枕无忧了。于是，某些机关工作人员就放松了对于保守国家机密的注意，他们在谈话中、电话中、信件中，随意泄漏秘密。他们对于文件的收发、传递、保管漫不经心，北京某机关的工作人员甚至发生过在市场上买东西丢掉文件包的事情。某些工厂和企业机关忽视保卫工作，重要机器无人看守，允许随便什么人进出窥视。某些人民群众因为没有受防奸的教育，看见可疑的人物和事情不向有关机关报告，听到谣言也不追根究底。如果听任这些现象继续下去，那么，我们的建设事业就将会遭受许多不必要的严重的损失。
    为了支援最后消灭国民党残余匪帮的革命战争，为了巩固革命秩序，完成经济建设的重大任务，除了公安机关必须继续努力之外，还应该发动广大群众积极支持这一斗争。要向干部和群众说明：特务在随时随地窥伺我们，破坏我们，我们丝毫不能麻痹；而只要大家警惕起来，采取必要措施，人人参加锄奸反特工作，特务是一定能被肃清的。在机关、部队、工厂中，应该建立一套保卫工作制度，养成保守国家机密的习惯，审查可疑的分子，奖惩在反特斗争中有功、有过的人员。对于人民群众更应加强宣传教育，让他们懂得锄奸反特是自己的事情，是保护自己生命财产的重要任务。有力的宣传，加上适当的组织工作，就会把人民群众吸引到反特务斗争中来。
    对于特务分子，我们仍然采取“首恶者必办、胁从者不问、立功者受奖”的政策。对于认清蒋匪最后灭亡在即、不愿蒋匪替作殉葬者的特务分子，允许他们悔过自新，向公安机关报告登记，人民政府一定给予重新作人之路。其中报告匪情或协助人民政府处理重大案犯有功者，人民政府一定允许其将功折罪，并给以奖励。对于执迷不悟、顽固到底、坚决与人民为敌的首恶分子，人民政府一定给以严厉的镇压。镇压不是空话，计匪的被捕，就是一个明显的例子。
