Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a directive on spring plowing production on the 10th. The full text is as follows:

	Spring has arrived. In order to complete the national agricultural production plan for 1950, governments at all levels should effectively and urgently seize the time, not miss the farming season, and organize spring plowing production work from all aspects. The Government Administration Council requires all people's organizations, not only farmers' organizations, but also women's, youth's, workers', and cultural organizations, to be united and urgently mobilized to participate in this work. For this purpose, the following decisions are made:

	1. In newly liberated areas, all government workers, during the spring plowing period, should make organizing the masses for spring plowing production their top priority. All work should be subordinate to spring plowing production, and efforts should be made to do a good job in the first spring plowing work after liberation. In addition, it must be clearly announced: First, before the distribution of land is implemented, the landlords' land still belongs to the landlords. It is still legal for landlords to collect rent from farmers after legally reducing rent, and farmers should still pay rent to landlords. Second, the right to harvest is guaranteed to all those who cultivate the land. If landlords have self-cultivated land in addition to renting out land, the right to harvest from their self-cultivated land is also protected, but landlords must not take this opportunity to forcibly take back the land rented to farmers. In the future, when land is distributed, the harvest from the landlords' self-cultivated land and the rent collected after legally reducing rent will also not be confiscated and distributed. Third, it is not allowed to abandon land. Those who abandon land will be punished by the People's Government, and others may be recruited to cultivate it, and the right to harvest is guaranteed to the cultivators. Fourth, in order to ensure timely cultivation, the land of fleeing landlords, the land confiscated from local bullies, and the land that is not managed by anyone, including investment, rent collection, and payment of public grain to the government, will be managed by the local People's Government on behalf of the owners, and will be cultivated by the original farmers. The distribution of land rights will be resolved later when land is distributed. Fifth, in order to take into account the difficulties faced by farmers in terms of production funds, the People's Government should issue agricultural loans in a planned manner, but all agricultural loans should be lent for means of production, such as draft animals, farm tools, and fertilizers, and should not be lent for currency or living materials. In addition, rural lending relationships should be developed. For lending relationships established after liberation, the interest rate should be freely agreed upon by both parties, and there should be borrowing and repayment. The government should recognize such new lending relationships as legal. Sixth, the People's Government does not prohibit hired labor in agricultural operations, even after the distribution of land is implemented. The demands of hired workers for improving their lives should be kept within reasonable limits, and employers must not reduce production or lay off hired workers under any pretext. Seventh, reward diligent cultivation, improve technology, and increase yields. When collecting grain, the burden should not be increased on land where yields have increased due to diligent cultivation and technical improvements. Eighth, strictly prohibit all destructive acts, such as slaughtering draft animals, destroying farm tools, felling trees, and demolishing buildings. Violators will be severely punished.

	2. In old liberated areas, continue to implement the policy of organizing in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, oppose unequal exchange, coercion, and spontaneous tendencies in mutual aid and labor exchange. Advocate becoming prosperous through labor and becoming rich through production. Oppose the lazy thinking of not engaging in production, "poverty is glorious," and "relying on struggle to eat." Public grain should be collected in proportion to the normal annual yield of the land, that is, the portion increased due to diligent cultivation and good organization should not be collected, in order to reward intensive cultivation, improve technology, improve soil quality, and increase production.

	3. Disaster areas will inevitably face many difficulties in spring plowing. In addition to implementing the Government Administration Council's instructions on production and disaster relief in order to overcome the spring famine, some grain should be saved from production and relief grain in a planned manner for consumption during spring plowing. People's governments, state trade agencies, and cooperatives at all levels should adjust seeds and help disaster areas in a planned manner. The reduction of livestock in disaster areas is already very serious, and methods should be immediately found to solve the difficulty of lacking fodder in order to preserve livestock and use them for spring plowing. Special attention must be paid to ensuring timely spring plowing, and vegetables and early-maturing crops should be planted as much as possible to shorten the famine. Mobilize those who have fled the famine to return home for spring plowing as soon as possible. The land left behind by those who cannot return must also be cultivated by others under appropriate conditions to ensure that it is not abandoned.

	4. In addition to the amount of agricultural loans already allocated and issued in the central government budget, local people's governments should strive to economize within the scope of the national overall financial budget and within their approved budgets, and draw a portion of grain and funds from the expenditure items after the summer harvest or autumn harvest in a planned manner to issue agricultural loans. Agricultural loans should be issued with emphasis and should be premised on benefiting production. There must be borrowing and repayment. Equal distribution and relief viewpoints are both wrong and should be corrected.

	5. Stipulating correct price policies for agricultural products and guaranteeing their implementation is one of the important keys to determining the relationship between the People's Government and farmers. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council is instructed to stipulate and announce reasonable parity ratios for major agricultural industrial raw material crops in a certain quantity and a certain specification for topping public grain.

	6. The work of helping and organizing the spring plowing production of revolutionary martyrs, military, and worker dependents should be earnestly inspected. In addition to rewarding and organizing their participation in spring plowing production, for some revolutionary martyrs, military, and worker dependents who are indeed poor and have no labor force, the system of contracted cultivation and other methods should be promoted according to the local labor situation to ensure that their land does not fall into a semi-abandoned state. People's governments at all levels should also provide as much assistance as possible to the production of local stationed troops.

	7. During the busy spring plowing season, service mobilization should be avoided as much as possible. In addition to areas where all war service has been expressly ordered to be stopped, areas that still have support-the-front war service tasks should also make good support-the-front transportation in a planned manner in advance as much as possible, so as to reduce war service to a minimum during spring plowing and put the greatest strength into spring plowing and sowing.

	8. In leading spring plowing production in various places, People's Representative Conferences, Farmers' Representative Conferences, especially Township Farmers' Representative Conferences, should be fully utilized to carry out mobilization and organization. All village cadres and labor heroes should actively take the lead in production and play an exemplary and promoting role.

	The above points must be guaranteed to be effectively implemented by local people's governments in accordance with local specific conditions, and immediately mobilized to set off a mass production upsurge on the basis of last year's autumn plowing movement and the expansion of winter plowing area, and truly guarantee the victorious completion of the 1950 agricultural production task.

　　中央人民政府政务院发布指示
    紧张动员组织春耕
    完成农业生产计划
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府政务院十日发布关于春耕生产的指示，全文如下：
    春季已到，为完成一九五○年国家所规定的农业生产计划，各级人民政府应该有效地紧张地抓紧时间，不误农时，从各方面组织春耕生产的工作。政务院要求所有人民团体，不仅农民团体，而且妇女的青年的工人的文化的团体，都一致紧张地动员起来，参加这一工作。为此，特作如下决定：
    一、在新解放区，所有政府工作人员，在春耕期间，应以组织群众春耕生产为第一要务，一切工作均应服从春耕生产，努力做好解放后的第一个春耕工作。此外，必须明确宣布：第一，未实行分配土地之前，地主的土地仍归地主所有，地主在依法减租后向农民收租仍然是合法的，农民仍应向地主交租。第二，保障一切耕种土地者收获的权利，地主除出租土地外，如仍有自耕部分土地者，其自耕部分土地的收获权利亦在保障之列，但地主不得借此强迫收回出租给农民的土地。今后实行分配土地时，对地主的自耕部分和依法减租后的收租部分的收获物，亦不予没收分配。第三，不许荒废土地。如有荒废土地者，人民政府得给以处分，并得招人耕种，而保障耕种者的收获权利。第四，为求及时耕种，凡逃亡地主的土地，没收恶霸分子的土地，及无人管理的土地，包括投资、收租、向政府缴纳公粮在内，均由当地人民政府代管，并由原来耕种的农民耕种之。其地权的分配留待以后分配土地时再行解决。第五，为顾及农民生产资金之困难，人民政府应有计划地发放农贷，但所有农贷均应贷给生产资料，如耕畜、农具和肥料，而不应贷给货币或生活资料。此外，应发展农村借贷关系，凡解放后成立之借贷关系，利率由双方自由协议，并应有借有还。此种新的借贷关系，政府应承认其为合法的。第六，对农业经营中的雇佣劳动，人民政府并不禁止，即在实行分配土地以后亦不禁止。雇工改善生活的要求应适可而止，雇主亦不得借故缩小生产，解雇雇工。第七，奖励勤劳耕作，改良技术，以增加产量。征粮时对因勤劳耕作及技术改良而产量增高的土地，不得增加负担。第八，严禁一切破坏行为，如宰杀耕畜、破坏农具、砍伐树木、拆毁建筑物等，违者严加惩处。
    二、在老解放区，继续在自愿互利的原则下贯彻组织起来的政策，反对互助变工中的不等价交换，强迫命令和自流倾向。提倡劳动发家，生产致富。反对不事生产、“贫光荣”和“靠斗争吃饭”的二流子思想。公粮应按土地常年应产量比例征收，即不征收其因勤劳耕作和善于组织而增产的部分，以奖励精耕细作，提高技术，改良土质，增加生产。
    三、灾区春耕困难必多，除贯彻政务院生产救灾的指示以便渡过春荒外，并应有计划地从生产中从救济粮中积存一些粮食准备春耕时吃用。各级人民政府、国家贸易机关和合作社均应有计划地调剂种籽，帮助灾区。灾区的牲口减少已很严重，应即设法解决草料缺乏的困难，以保存牲口而使用于春耕。尤须注意保证春耕及时，并尽量播种蔬菜与早熟作物，以缩短灾荒。动员逃荒外出者早日回家春耕。其不能返回者所丢下的土地，亦须在适当条件下交别人耕种，保证不使荒废。
    四、除中央人民政府预算中所已分配发放的农贷数额外，各地人民政府应在国家整个财政概算范围内，在批准的自己的预算内，力求撙节，并有计划地从夏收后或秋收后的支出项下抽出一部粮款，发放农贷。农贷应有重点地发放，并应以有利生产为前提，必须有借有还。平均使用与救济观点都是错误，应加纠正。
    五、规定正确的农产品的价格政策并保证其实行，这是确定人民政府对农民关系的重要关键之一。责成政务院财政经济委员会规定并公布主要农产工业原料作物在一定数量和一定规格顶交公粮的合理比价。
    六、对帮助与组织烈、军、工属春耕生产的工作，应认真地加以进行检查，除奖励并组织其参加春耕生产外，应对某些确实贫苦而又无劳动力的烈、军、工属，根据各地劳动力情况推行包耕制等办法，保证他们的土地不致陷于半荒芜的状态。各级人民政府对当地驻军的生产，也要尽可能地多方协助。
    七、春耕农忙期间，要尽量避免勤务动员，除业已明令停止一切战争勤务的地区外，仍有支前战勤任务的地区，亦应尽可能地事先有计划地把支前运输作好，以便在春耕中把战争勤务减至最小限度，而以最大力量投入春耕播种。
    八、各地在领导春耕生产中，应充分运用人民代表会议、农民代表会议，特别是乡农民代表会议进行动员和组织，所有乡村干部和劳动英雄们，均应积极带头生产，起模范作用和推动作用。
    上述各点，各地人民政府务须根据当地具体情况，保证切实执行，并立即动员起来，在去年秋耕运动以及冬耕面积扩大的基础上，掀起群众性的生产热潮，确实保障一九五○年农业生产任务的胜利完成。
      总理  周恩来
        一九五○年三月十日
