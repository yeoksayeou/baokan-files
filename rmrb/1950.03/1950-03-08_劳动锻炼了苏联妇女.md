　　Labor Hardened Soviet Women
    Liang Shan
    Soviet women, like men, are actively participating in the construction of all sectors on the labor front. For them, who have been liberated and have a high degree of political consciousness, labor has become an indispensable part of their lives, just like air, sunshine, water... Women throughout the Soviet Union are striving for their great political goal—building an ideal communist society.

    Today, women have positions in all labor sectors in the Soviet Union. Millions of women are shouldering leadership roles in industries and enterprises. More than 250,000 women serve as engineers and technicians, so this is no longer a rarity in the eyes of Soviet people. Many women serve as stationmasters, engineers, and section leaders on the railways; half of these experts have received formal higher or secondary specialized education; during the war, nearly one million women were engaged in railway work. Women also participate in water and air transport; there are many women among the civilian aircraft pilots. Soviet women are an even greater force in the countryside. According to statistics from November 1948, there are now more than 15,000 female farmers serving as chairmen and vice-chairmen of collective farms; 350,000 are in charge of field work teams; more than 25,000 serve as drivers of tractors and combines or lead tractor driving teams; and nearly 700 female collective farm members have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for achieving high yields.

    In the Soviet Union, women use their tireless labor to consolidate and develop the economy of the Soviet state. Before, during, and after the war, Soviet women made immeasurable contributions to the expansion of socialist industry and collectivized agriculture. During the anti-fascist war, they became famous throughout the world, along with their country, for contributing immense strength to the great victory over the common enemy of mankind: on the front lines, Soviet women experienced the victorious path of bloody struggle, defeating the German invaders alongside men, and destroying their nests. After the war, 120,000 women received combat medals, and another 62 women were awarded the glorious title of Hero of the Soviet Union; in the rear, they tenaciously overcame all the difficulties imposed by the enemy, selflessly worked in factories and collective farms, and helped the army obtain all the materials needed for the war.

　　劳动锻炼了苏联妇女
    梁山
    苏联妇女在劳动战线上，和男人一样，正积极地参与一切部门的建设工作。对于获得了解放并具有高度政治觉悟的她们来说，劳动已经像空气、日光、水………一样，成了她们生活中不可缺少的成分。全苏联妇女都在为着她们远大的政治目标——建设理想的共产主义社会而努力。
    现在，全苏联各个劳动部门，都有妇女的位置。千万个妇女担负了工业和企业中的领导工作。妇女充当工程师和技师的已超过二十五万人，所以这事在苏联人看来已经不是什么稀罕的了。不少妇女担任着铁道上的站长、工程师和段领导人等职务；她们中有一半专家，是受过正规的高等或中等专门教育的；在战时，从事铁路工作的妇女将近一百万人。妇女也参加水运和空运事业，民用飞机的驾驶员，就有很多的妇女。苏联妇女在农村中，更是一支巨大的力量。据一九四八年十一月的统计：现有一万五千多个女农民，担任着集体农庄的正、副主席；负责田野工作队的有三十五万人；充当拖拉机与康拜因机的驾驶员或领导拖拉驾驶队的，有两万五千人以上；由于获得高度丰收而得到社会主义劳动英雄称号的集体农庄女庄员，则将近七百名。
    在苏联，妇女以不倦的劳动，来巩固与发展苏维埃国家的经济。战前、战时与战后，苏联妇女在壮大社会主义工业和集体化的农业中，都作出了难以衡量的功绩。在进行反法西斯战争时期，她们因在战胜人类公敌的伟功中，付出了巨大力量，而和她们的国家同样名扬天下：在前方，苏联妇女经历了流血斗争的胜利路程，与男子并肩击败了德寇，并捣毁了他们的巢穴。战争结束后，十二万妇女获得了战斗勋章，另有六十二名妇女更荣获苏联英雄的光荣称号；在后方，她们曾顽强地克服敌人给予的一切困难，奋不顾身地在工厂和集体农场中进行劳动，帮助军队获得一切战时所需的物资。
