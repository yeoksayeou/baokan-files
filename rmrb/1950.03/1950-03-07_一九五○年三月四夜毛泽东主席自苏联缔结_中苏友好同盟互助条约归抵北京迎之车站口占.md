　　Impromptu Poem at the Beijing Train Station Welcoming Chairman Mao Zedong Back from the Soviet Union After Concluding the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on the Fourth Night of March, 1950
    Ma Xulun
    The spring night of ten thousand households rings with firecrackers, (Note) National anthem and music overflow with joyous sound;
    Chairman returns from afar with no gifts to offer, eager to step forward to welcome and ask after his well-being.
    Note: The day after the Lantern Festival in the Lunar Calendar

    One book surpasses breaking through ten thousand layers of encirclement, the two nations united in heart to extinguish the flames of war;
    The luggage is not valuable with hidden gold and jade, but only brings back the two words of peace.

    China and the Soviet Union join hands to protect peace, welcomed by all, feared by all ghosts;
    Two red candles are raised high, illuminating the world with brightness.

　　一九五○年三月四夜毛泽东主席自苏联缔结
    中苏友好同盟互助条约归抵北京迎之车站口占
    马叙伦
    万户春宵炮竹鸣，（注）国歌和乐溢欢声；
    主席远归无献物，争前迎候问安宁。
    注：时正农历正月元宵后一日
    一书胜破万重围，两国同心熄战机；
    行装不贵藏金玉，但带和平二字归。
    中苏协力障和平，人尽欢迎鬼尽惊；
    红烛两条高举起，照来世界并光明。
