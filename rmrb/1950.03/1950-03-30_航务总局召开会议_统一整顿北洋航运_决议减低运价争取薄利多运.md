　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th: The Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government held a Northern Shipping Route Transportation Conference in Tianjin from the 18th to the 25th, to study the unified rectification of Northern shipping and strengthen the exchange of materials between the Northeast, North China, and East China regions. More than 30 representatives from the Northeast Maritime Administration Bureau, the North China Maritime Bureau, and state-owned shipping companies and relevant maritime administrative agencies from major ports such as Yantai, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Dalian, and Tianjin attended the meeting. In accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's decision to unify national maritime work, the meeting thoroughly studied issues such as reducing shipping costs, lowering freight rates, unifying the organization of Northern shipping, opening regular shipping routes, and improving shipping management, and formulated eight resolutions regarding the 1950 Northern Shipping Plan. The resolutions stipulate that freight standards for routes between ports should be unified, with the principle of small profits and large turnover and lower than railway freight rates as the basis for determining freight rates. In addition, the resolutions also made specific provisions for unified organization of transportation, unified allocation of ships, unified port management, as well as improving ship management, implementing economic accounting systems, and implementing transportation responsibility systems. Currently, the main problem in Northern shipping is that there are more ships than cargo. One reason is that freight rates are too high, generally three to five times higher than railway freight rates; the other is that there are no fixed routes and regular liners in each port, and there is a lack of connection between port authorities and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After the Northern Shipping Conference, the above problems should be resolved.

　　航务总局召开会议
    统一整顿北洋航运
    决议减低运价争取薄利多运
    【新华社天津二十九日电】中央人民政府交通部航务总局于十八日至二十五日在天津召开北洋航线运输会议，研讨统一整顿北洋航运，加强东北、华北、华东各区间的物资交流问题。出席会议的有东北航务总局、华北航务局及烟台、青岛、连云港、大连、天津等各主要港口国营航运公司及有关航务行政机关代表三十余人。会议根据中央统一全国航务工作决定的精神，详尽地研讨了减低航运成本、减低运价、统一北洋航运组织、开辟定期航线及改善航运管理等问题，并制定了关于一九五○年度北洋航运计划的八项决议。决议规定各港区间航线应统一运费标准，以薄利多运、低于铁路运价为确定运价的原则。此外决议对统一组织运输，统一调配船舶、统一港务管理以及改善船舶管理、推行经济核算制，实行运输负责制等问题亦作了具体规定。按目前北洋航运中的主要问题是船多货少。其原因一是运价过高，一般运价超过铁路运价三倍到五倍；一是各港口无一定航线和定期班轮，各港务局和招商局之间缺乏联系。北洋航运会议后，上述问题当可获得解决。
