	Rushes to Produce 9,000 Summer Uniforms – Neat, Meticulous, and Up to Standard
	[Our Newspaper] The women workers of the sewing department of the Beijing Women's Cotton Weaving Factory, directly under the Beijing Women's Federation, have put forward the slogan "Guarantee that the People's Liberation Army does not wear shoddy clothes" and are actively rushing to produce summer uniforms. On January 20th, the factory contracted to produce 9,000 sets of summer uniforms for soldiers from the North China Military Region Supply Department Clothing General Factory. When the work began, the workers did not pay enough attention to quality. The finished products generally had some minor problems, such as crooked collars, inconsistent widths of the front placket, and uneven pleats on the cuffs. After the North China Military Region Logistics Department Supply Department Clothing General Factory pointed out the shortcomings, they humbly accepted and studied ways to improve. At that time, the workers proposed, "We must immediately correct the problems and ensure that the quality fully meets the prescribed standards." Thanks to the efforts of the workers, the quality has generally improved. The factory has now completed 6,200 sets, and the results of the inspection by the Supply Department show that they have achieved 100% of the prescribed standards. The finished products meet the regulations in terms of size and specifications, and the sewing is particularly neat and meticulous. At present, the factory workers have proposed that not only must the quality meet the standards, but they also guarantee to complete the task on schedule.

　　保证解放军不穿坏衣服
    京妇女棉织厂
    赶制夏服九千套整洁细密合规格
    【本报讯】京市妇联直属妇女棉织工厂缝纫部工友们，提出“保证解放军不穿坏衣服”的口号，积极赶制夏服。该厂在一月二十日包制了华北军需部被服总厂战士夏服九千套。当工作开始时，职工们对质量尚不够重视，所制出的成品中一般的都有些小毛病，如领子上的不正，前襟明牌两头宽窄不一，袖口打折打得不均等。经华北军区后勤军需部被服总厂检查指出缺点后，她们都虚心地接受并研究了改进办法，当时职工们提出“我们一定马上纠正毛病，且要把质量做到完全合于规定的标准样式”。在职工的努力下，质量普遍提高。现在该厂已完成六千二百套，经军需部检查结果，认为已做到百分之百的规定标样。成品在尺码和规格上均合规定，缝制更特别整洁细密。目前，该厂职工提出不但质量要合标准，并保证按期完成任务。
