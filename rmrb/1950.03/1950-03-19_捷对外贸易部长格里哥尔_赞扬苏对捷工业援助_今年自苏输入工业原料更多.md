Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th Dispatch from Electric News Agency: Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Minister Gregor, who returned after signing the 1950 Soviet-Czechoslovak trade agreement with the Soviet Union, wrote in the Red Rights newspaper on the 16th: The Soviet Union's shipment of machinery to our country has made the United States' discrimination against our country a useless weapon. The Soviet Union is willing and able to transport goods that certain capitalist countries refuse to transport to us, and the quality of Soviet machinery is often superior to that of capitalist countries. Gregor emphasized: In 1949, the industrial raw materials transported by the Soviet Union to Czechoslovakia accounted for most of Czechoslovakia's total industrial needs. The quantity of industrial raw materials delivered in 1950 is even greater. If Czechoslovak industry does not have these raw materials, it will be impossible to continue production.

    赞扬苏对捷工业援助
    今年自苏输入工业原料更多
    【新华社十八日讯】电通社布拉格讯：在苏联签订了一九五○年苏捷换货协定后回国的捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部长格里哥尔，十六日在红色权利报撰文称：苏联以机器运交我国，已使美国对我国的歧视成为一种毫无作用的武器。苏联愿意而且能够输送为若干资本主义国家拒绝输送给我们的货物，而且苏联机器的质量，经常优于资本主义国家的产品。格里哥尔强调称：一九四九年，苏联运交捷克斯洛伐克的工业原料，占捷克斯洛伐克全部工业所需的大部。一九五○年工业原料运交的数量更大，如果捷克斯洛伐克工业没有这些原料，势将无法连续生产。
