　　Feiger Visits Liulang Village in the Suburbs of Beijing, Touring the New Countryside After Land Reform
[Our Newspaper] World Democratic Youth League representative and Secretary-General of the French Republican Youth League, Leo Feiger, visited Liulang Village in the suburbs of Beijing, a new countryside after land reform, on the 10th. Hundreds of farmers welcomed him along the road with gongs and drums, shouting slogans. At the mass meeting, young farmers of Liulang Village enthusiastically presented Feiger with the water chestnuts and lotus roots they had harvested. A small discussion was held where Feiger introduced the situation of the French youth's struggle, and the farmers also spoke about their situation before and after liberation. Before leaving, Feiger also visited four families who were previously poor peasants and farm laborers.
