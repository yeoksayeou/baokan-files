Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: The reactionary authorities in the Philippines are intensifying their anti-Chinese atrocities. According to a dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Manila on the 4th, the Philippine government has launched a movement against the so-called "illegal" residence of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, attempting to expel 50,000 overseas Chinese from the country. Any overseas Chinese deemed by the Philippine government to have "expired visas" or "improper documents" will be ordered to leave the country. On March 3rd, twelve overseas Chinese were arrested. The Philippine government is also attempting to take the opportunity to extort money from overseas Chinese. The same source revealed that the Philippine Immigration Bureau, on the grounds that forcing 50,000 overseas Chinese to leave the country "would be too costly," plans to collect a huge "public debt" of 2,000 Philippine pesos (equivalent to 1,000 US dollars) from each overseas Chinese traveling to the Philippines for a short period before their "visas expire."

　　菲反动当局加紧排华  竟企图驱逐五万华侨
    【新华社北京七日电】菲律宾反动当局加紧排华暴行。据国民党中央社马尼拉四日电：菲律宾政府已展开反对华侨所谓“非法”居留菲境的运动，企图驱逐华侨五万人离境。凡被菲政府认为“签证满期”或“证件不当”的华侨，都将被勒令出境。本月三日，已有十二名华侨被捕。菲律宾政府并图乘机对华侨进行敲诈。同上消息透露，菲移民局以强迫五万华侨出境“需费太大”为理由，拟在华侨“签证满期”以前，向每一短期旅菲的华侨，征收菲币两千元（合一千美元）的巨额“公债”。
