　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou: After being organized in the rural social reform movement, rural working women in Hubei Province have played a significant role in supporting the front lines, autumn grain requisition, and rent reduction against local tyrants. According to statistics, 300,000 working women across the province have joined farmers' associations, and preparatory committees for democratic women's federations have been established in most special districts, cities, and counties. Organized rural women have actively participated in supporting the front lines, busily grinding military grain, helping soldiers sew and wash clothes, caring for the wounded and sick, assisting men in repairing bridges and roads, and making military shoes. Women in Yunyang Special District alone made 20,000 pairs of military shoes.

　　During the autumn grain requisition, women also actively participated in unearthing hidden land and delivering public grain. In Lishan County, under the leadership of the female village chief Gao Qingting, they launched a legitimate struggle against landlords who concealed land and unearthed more than 100 mu of hidden land. In Yingcheng Fourth District, in Shuangdun Township, a woman from Menqian Village reported all the hidden land of the landlords in the village during the reasonable burden struggle, leading to a complete victory. More than 70 women from Sui County crossed twelve rivers to deliver public grain to warehouses eighty li away.

　　Women have also not lagged behind in the fight against local tyrants and rent reduction. When 29 bao (a unit of local administration) in Jiangling County jointly struggled against the bandit leader and local tyrant landlord Wang Guobiao, many women braved the rain to attend the struggle meeting with their children and accused the tyrant of his crimes. In Wuchang, Hanyang, Yingshan, and other places, when men went out to work, women organized themselves to carry out rent reduction struggles. In the struggle, they exposed the landlords' deceptive behaviors, such as attempting to issue empty IOUs and feigning poverty, forcing the landlords to implement rent refunds and reductions in accordance with government regulations.

　　In addition, women have begun to combine production with learning culture, such as recognizing the characters for "spinning thread" while spinning thread and learning the characters for "weaving cloth" while weaving cloth, closely integrating learning with application.

　　湖北省各地农民协会组织
    卅万劳动妇女参加
    积极支援战争进行社会改革
    【新华社讯】汉口消息：湖北省农村劳动妇女在农村社会改革运动中组织起来后，已在支援前线、秋季征粮和反恶霸减租等工作中起了重大作用。据统计，全省已有三十万劳动妇女参加了农民协会，大部专区、市、县已先后成立了民主妇联筹备委员会。有组织的农村妇女们积极地参加了支援前线的工作，她们紧张地进行着赶磨军粮、帮助战士缝洗衣服、看护伤病员、协助男子修桥补路、做军鞋等工作，仅郧阳专区的妇女即做了军鞋两万双。在秋季征粮中，妇女们也积极地参加了挤黑田和送公粮的工作。礼山县一个村在女村长高清庭领导下，向瞒田地主展开合法斗争，并挤出黑瞒田一百多亩；应城四区双墩乡门前村一个妇女在合理负担斗争中将全村地主的黑田都报了出来，因而使斗争获得全胜。随县七十余名妇女涉过十二道河，将公粮送到离她们八十里以外的仓库中去。在反恶霸和减租斗争中，妇女们也不落后。江陵县二十九个保联合斗争匪首恶霸地主王国彪时，许多妇女冒雨抱着孩子前来参加斗争大会，并向大会控诉恶霸的罪行。武昌、汉阳、应山等地男人们出外做工时，妇女们就组织起来进行减租斗争，在斗争中她们揭破了地主企图开空欠条和装穷等欺骗行为，迫使地主按照政府规定实行退租和减租。另外，妇女们并与生产结合开始学习文化，如纺线时就认“纺线”，织布时就学“织布”等字，使学和用密切结合起来。
