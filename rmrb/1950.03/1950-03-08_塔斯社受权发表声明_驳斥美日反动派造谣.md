TASS, Moscow, March 5th: A Japanese radio station, followed by a report from Reuters of Great Britain, released a piece of information claiming: Several former Japanese prisoners of war repatriated from the Soviet Union declared in the Japanese Diet that the Soviet government, at the request of the Japanese Communist Party, delayed the repatriation of "reactionary elements" among the Japanese prisoners of war.

TASS is authorized to declare: This absurd piece of information is a malicious fabrication.
