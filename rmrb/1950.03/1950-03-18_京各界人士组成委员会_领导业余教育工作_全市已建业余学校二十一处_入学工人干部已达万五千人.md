　　Beijing News Agency: The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, at its first meeting last November, passed a resolution to establish formal spare-time schools for workers and cadres in Beijing. This work, after more than two months of active preparation, is now being widely carried out. The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently issued invitations to Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, Vice Chairman Liu Ren, Liao Mosha of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xiao Ming, Liu Laifu, and Zu Tiangong of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Weng Dujian, Hou Junyan, and Xue Chengye of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, Mou Zexian of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, Ma Guangdou of the Municipal Bureau of Labor, Yang Bozheng of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Zhang Xiaomei of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, Qian Duansheng and Wen Hanjiang of the Beijing Municipal Education Workers' Union, and others, to attend a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 2:00 PM on the 16th to formally establish the Beijing Municipal Spare-Time Education Work Committee. This committee will uniformly lead the city's spare-time education work, determine the direction, and review work plans. The meeting decided to appoint the invited individuals as members of the committee and elected Wu Han as the Chairman, and Liao Mosha, Weng Dujian, Liu Laifu, and Zhang Xiaomei as Vice Chairmen.

　　After Wu Han and Liao Mosha reported on the preparatory work, the committee members discussed issues such as the direction, academic system, teachers, leadership relationships, and school establishment methods. Comrade Peng Zhen also explained the purpose, direction, curriculum, methods, and development prospects of establishing formal spare-time schools. He particularly pointed out: The purpose of these schools is to improve the cultural level of workers and cadres. Only by improving the cultural level can we improve political theory and production technology. If we want to industrialize the country, we need both machinery and equipment and cadres. We need cadres with culture, technology, and experience. We must improve the current workers and cadres in terms of culture, thereby improving them politically, theoretically, and technically. We must cultivate a large number of engineers, technicians, and managers among factory workers and cadres. We must use these schools as the foundation for cultivating construction talents.

　　Twenty-one formal spare-time schools have already been established in Beijing: nine of them have started classes, and twelve are in the process of examination and class placement. The total number of enrolled students is over 15,000, with industrial workers accounting for two-thirds and government cadres accounting for one-third. Currently, there are two levels: elementary and intermediate. The elementary level is equivalent to the sixth grade of elementary school and is tentatively set to graduate in three years, with three semesters per year and six hours of class per week. The courses are Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge. The intermediate school is divided into two systems, A and B. System A graduates in three years, and System B graduates in four years. The courses are Chinese, mathematics, physics and chemistry, natural history, and history and geography. Textbooks for the formal spare-time schools are compiled and selected by specialized personnel hired by the Spare-Time Education Work Committee Preparatory Committee. The elementary textbooks consist of twenty-four volumes for Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge. The intermediate textbooks are selected from the junior high school textbooks of Xinhua, Sanlian, and Kaiming bookstores. Teachers in the spare-time schools are divided into full-time and part-time teachers. Full-time teachers are qualified teachers from ordinary schools, and part-time teachers are cadres and staff from various factories and government agencies. They are all paid according to the salary standards of ordinary primary and secondary schools. Currently, one hundred and six qualified teachers have been registered, and seventy of them have been assigned to teach in various schools. There are currently three types of organizational forms for spare-time schools: The first type is those independently established by large factories, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Spare-Time School, which has more than 2,300 students (which started on March 12 and is scheduled to start classes on April 1). The People's Printing Plant Spare-Time School, which is currently being prepared, has already received applications from 3,000 students. The second type is joint spare-time schools jointly established by small factories or government agencies, such as the Dongcheng Five Factories Joint Spare-Time School. The third type is spare-time schools established by district, with students including workers and government cadres. The administrative work of the spare-time schools independently established by factories is led by the school committees organized by the Party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations of the factories. The spare-time schools established by district are jointly organized by the district government, the district labor union, and other parties to form a school committee. In addition to the twenty-one schools that have already been established, other units are also preparing to build schools. According to the overall plan, the end of April is set as the first stage of establishing spare-time schools, to consolidate the schools that have already been established, and then carry out the second phase of school construction.

    吴晗、廖沫沙报告筹备工作后，到会委员对方针、学制、教员、领导关系、建校方式等问题进行讨论，彭真同志并说明开办正规业余学校的目的、方针、课程、方法和发展前途，他特别指出：这种学校的目的，是要提高工人和干部的文化水平，只有提高了文化水平，才能提高政治理论和生产技术。我们要使国家工业化，一方面是要有机器设备；另一方面要有干部。要有有文化、有技术、有经验的干部，要使现在的工人和干部在文化上提高，从而使他们在政治上、理论上和技术上提高，我们要在工厂工人和机关干部中培养大批的工程师、技师和管理人员。要把这种学校作为培养建设人材的基础。
    北京市的正规业余学校，现在已经建立的有二十一校：其中开学开课的九校，正在考试编班的十二校。入学的总人数达一万五千多人：其中产业工人占三分之二、机关干部占三分之一。现在设初级和中级两种：初级相当于小学六年的程度，暂定三年毕业，一年分三个学期，每周上课六小时，课程为国语、算术、常识；中级学校分甲、乙两种制度，甲种三年毕业，乙种四年毕业，课程为国文、数学、理化、博物、史地。正规业余学校教材，经业余教育工作委员会筹备会聘请专门人员编选，初级课本，国语、算术、常识共二十四册，中级课本，选用新华、三联、开明三书店的初中课本。业余学校的教员分专任和兼任两种：专任教员是聘请合格的普通学校教员，兼任教员由各工厂机关的干部和职员担任，一律按普通中小学的薪资待遇。现在已经登记合格的教员有一百零六人，分发各校任课的已有七十人。业余学校的组织形式目前有三类：第一类是各大工厂单独开办的，如石景山钢铁厂业余学校有学员两千三百余人（已于三月十二日开学，定四月一日上课），正在筹备中的人民印刷厂业余学校报名的学员已达三千人；第二类是各小工厂或各机关联合开办的联合业余学校，如东城五厂联合业余学校；第三类是按城区分区开办的业余学校，学员包括工人和机关干部。各工厂单独开办的业余学校，由工厂的党政工团组织校委会，领导学校行政工作。分区设立的业余学校由区政府、区工会和各方面合组校委会。除已经建立的二十一个学校以外，还有其他单位正在筹备建校。根据整个计划准备到四月底截止，作为建立业余学校的第一个阶段，把已经建立的学校加以巩固，然后进行第二期建校工作。
