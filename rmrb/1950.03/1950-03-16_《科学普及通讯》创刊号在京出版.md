[Report from this newspaper] The Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has published a monthly journal, "Science Popularization Newsletter," in order to widely mobilize natural science workers, young students, and cultural cadres of workers, peasants, and soldiers from all over the country who are in production, healthcare, national defense, education, research, and other positions to participate in science popularization work. It is hoped that this publication will facilitate the exchange of work experience, discuss working methods, and inspire everyone's enthusiasm for engaging in science popularization work, so that this work becomes a mass movement, truly achieving the point where "everyone who knows science must teach someone who does not," and universally improve the scientific level of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
