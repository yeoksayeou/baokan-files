    Taiyuan Railway Bureau Plants One Million Trees
    [From Our Newspaper] To respond to the Ministry of Railways' call to launch a railway greening campaign to protect roadbeds and develop production, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and the Taiyuan Railway Trade Union jointly issued a notice, mobilizing all railway employees to complete the planting of one million trees from March 21st to April 10th. It is stipulated that suitable trees should be planted on both sides of the roadbed, beyond eight meters from the center of the track, according to different soil types. To ensure a survival rate of over 90%, in addition to specific instructions on planting methods, a personal responsibility system has been established, requiring each track maintenance worker to plant and keep alive at least eighteen trees.
