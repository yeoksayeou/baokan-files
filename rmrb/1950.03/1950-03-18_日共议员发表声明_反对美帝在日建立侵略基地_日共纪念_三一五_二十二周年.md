　　Japanese Communist Party Legislators Issue Statement
    Opposing US Imperialist Establishment of Aggression Bases in Japan
    Japanese Communist Party Commemorates 22nd Anniversary of the "March 15th Incident"
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 17th] The Japanese Communist Party has strongly criticized the US occupying forces' sinister scheme to jointly construct military bases on Okinawa Island with Japan. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party legislators issued a statement in the Diet on the 14th, denouncing the US recruitment of Japanese contractors to participate in the construction of US military bases on Okinawa Island, stating that Japanese participation in military construction projects violates the Potsdam Declaration, which stipulates the demilitarization of Japan. According to the United Press, US Army engineers announced on the 13th that they had "invited 19 Japanese contractors to fly to Okinawa Island on the 14th to bid on construction projects worth millions of dollars" to make the island one of the important US military bases. The US military's Okinawa District engineer representative in Tokyo revealed that the scope of cooperation with Japan in building bases would be expanded in the future and said that "more construction plans will be publicly solicited for bids soon."
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 17th] The Japanese Communist Party held a memorial meeting in Tokyo on the 15th for the 22nd anniversary of the "March 15th Incident," a bloody suppression of the revolution by Japanese reactionaries. According to the United Press, a huge banner reading "Oppose the Establishment of Bases in Japan" was hung at the venue. JCP Politburo member Sanzō Nosaka delivered a speech amidst cheers from the crowd, stating that the aggressors threatening Japan's future and world peace are plotting a third world war. He called on the Japanese people not to let the aggressors colonize Japan and not to let the aggressors maintain military bases in Japan after the signing of a peace treaty. Nosaka also pointed out that socialist countries are on the rise, while capitalist countries are in decline.
    The "March 15th Incident" is the anniversary of the large-scale terrorist suppression of the Japanese Communist Party by the Japanese reactionary ruling class 22 years ago. In the 1928 Japanese general election, the Labor-Farmer Party, influenced by the JCP, participated in the election and won more than 200,000 votes. The Tanaka Cabinet, representing the Japanese ruling class, was greatly shocked and launched a nationwide frenzied roundup of Japanese revolutionary people at 5:00 am on March 15th, with thousands of JCP members arrested by the police.

　　日共议员发表声明
    反对美帝在日建立侵略基地
    日共纪念“三一五”二十二周年
    【新华社十七日讯】日本共产党抨击美国占领军与日本共同建筑冲绳岛军事基地的罪恶勾当。据路透社东京讯：日本共产党议员于十四日在国会发表声明，对美国招用日本包工赴冲绳岛参与美国建筑军事基地的工程一事，予以斥责称：日本人参与军事建设工程，违反了规定使日本非军事化的波茨坦宣言。据合众社报道，美国陆军工程师曾在十三日宣布：他们已“邀请十九名日本包工，于十四日飞赴冲绳岛进行投标，承包价值千百万美元的建筑工程”，以使该岛成为美国的重要军事基地之一。美军冲绳区工程师驻东京代表透露以后将扩大与日本合作建筑基地的范围，并表示“不久将有更多建筑计划公开征求投标”。
    【新华社十七日讯】日本共产党十五日在东京举行日本反动派血腥镇压革命的“三一五”二十二周年纪念会。据合众社报道，会场悬挂巨幅“反对在日本建立基地”的长条标语。日共政治局委员野坂参三在群众欢呼声中发表演说称：威胁日本的将来及世界和平的侵略者，正在阴谋策划第三次世界大战。他号召日本人民不要让侵略者把日本殖民地化，不要让侵略者在和约签订后在日本保有军事基地。野坂并指出：社会主义国家正在上升，而资本主义国家却正在没落中。
    按“三一五”是二十二年前日本反动统治阶级向日本共产党实行大规模恐怖镇压的纪念日。一九二八年日本大选时，在日共影响下的劳动农民党参加竞选，获得二十万选票之多。代表日本统治阶级的田中内阁大为震骇，就在三月十五日清晨五时，对日本革命人民发动了全国性的疯狂大检举，被警察逮捕的日共党员达数千名之多。
