　　Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company
    Saves Over 4,000 Jin of Millet in February
    [Our Dispatch] The Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company achieved remarkable results in conservation during February, saving over 4,000 jin of millet. To effectively promote conservation, the company established a conservation committee in early February. Subordinate units formed conservation groups, individuals developed conservation plans, and challenges were launched among themselves. Due to the widespread mobilization of the masses, regular expenses alone were reduced by over 3,900 jin of millet in February, and telephone expenses were reduced by over 1,000 jin. Work efficiency also improved significantly. For example, in the past, only 300 bolts of cloth could be packaged and 100 pieces packed daily, but now this has increased to 500 bolts of cloth and 180 pieces packed daily. During the same period, the system and procedures for requisitioning items also created the use of requisition slips and the exchange of old for new, which played a certain role in eliminating waste. The main shortcomings at present are that the effort is tight at the beginning but slackens later, and there is insufficient supervision and inspection. Some individual departments (such as the kitchen) have not yet been involved in this campaign. These are all issues that deserve great efforts to overcome in the future.

　　北京花纱布分公司
    二月份节米四千余斤
    【本报讯】北京花纱布分公司二月份节约成绩显著，共节省小米四千余斤。该公司为了有效地推动节约，曾于二月上旬建立了节约委员会，所属各单位成立了节约小组，个人制订了节约计划，相互展开挑战。由于比较普遍地发动了群众，故二月份只经常费一项就节约了小米三千九百余斤；电话费节约了一千余斤。而工作效率亦有显著提高，如整装和打包，过去每天只能整布三百匹，打包百件，现在则提高到每日整五百匹，打包一百八十件的水平。同一时期，在领用物品的制度和手续上，也创造了使用领物单和以旧易新的办法，在杜绝浪费上起了一定的作用。目前的主要缺点是前紧后松和督促检查不够，个别部门（如伙房）还未能投入这一运动，这些都是值得今后大力克服的。
