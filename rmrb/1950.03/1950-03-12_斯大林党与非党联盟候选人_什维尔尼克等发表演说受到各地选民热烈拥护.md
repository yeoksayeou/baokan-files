Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 11th dispatch: TASS, Minsk dispatch: Voters in the Minsk city electoral district held a grand meeting on the 7th with their candidate for the Union Chamber of the Supreme Soviet, Marshal of the Soviet Union Voroshilov. Stakhanovite workers from the Voroshilov Machinery Factory, Stalin Prize-winning poets and artists, scientists, Red Army generals, and many others spoke enthusiastically in support of Voroshilov and called on voters to vote for him. The congress enthusiastically passed a congratulatory telegram to Stalin, the best friend of the Belarusian people.

　　Voroshilov delivered a lengthy speech amidst constant applause and cheers. He first thanked the voters for their trust in him and said that this honor should be attributed to the great Stalin.

　　Voroshilov stated: People who live and work in the Stalin era are incredibly fortunate. Lenin and Stalin, geniuses who inherited the cause of Marx and Engels, have turned the great doctrines of Marxism into living reality.

　　Voroshilov recounted the great victory of the Soviet people in saving the world from the barbarous rule of fascism during the Great Patriotic War and described how the Soviet Union today, for the first time in history, has a long common border with friendly fraternal nations. He said: These achievements have great political and international significance and were obtained by our heroic people under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party. Although we suffered great sacrifices in the war, we have today achieved great accomplishments in the recovery, improvement, and growth of the national economy. When discussing the achievements of industry and agriculture in the first four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, Voroshilov specifically highlighted the achievements of Belarus, which had been occupied by the German fascists, saying: The heroic people of Belarus have restored enterprises, cities, and collective farms as if they were new. The output of many industrial products, such as peat and cement, has greatly exceeded pre-war levels, and the harvest of important crops has reached pre-war levels. Four hundred and fifty thousand houses and thousands of cultural institutions have been built in collective farms. Only under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party could the wounds of war be healed in such a short time. Today in the Soviet Union, one in five people is studying in school. This is our greatest achievement; the dreams of the old days have become a reality.

　　In his speech, Voroshilov declared that if imperialism dares to launch a third world war, the dying existence of capitalism will come to an end!

　　Voroshilov continued to discuss the achievements of Soviet literature, art, and scientific inventions, and said: Soviet science has solved the secrets of atomic energy, and the Soviet Union has its own atomic bomb, thereby ending the atomic blackmail of the imperialists. When discussing the international situation, Voroshilov spoke of Lenin and Stalin's instructions regarding the possibility of the long-term coexistence of socialism and capitalism, and said that this consistently expresses the hope of the Soviet people to ensure peace and security for mankind. Voroshilov quoted Stalin's open letter to Wallace in May 1948, saying: The simultaneous existence of two systems and the peaceful settlement of differences between the Soviet Union and the United States are not only possible but also absolutely necessary. The Soviet Union's foreign policy and diplomatic actions have invariably followed these instructions. Voroshilov said: Comrade Stalin said in his report to the 17th Congress of our Party: "We advocate and uphold the cause of peace, but we are not afraid of threats. Those who dare to invade us will be met with crushing retaliation, teaching them not to stick their pig snouts into our Soviet garden again." Today, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are in full bloom, but the pig snouts, despite the warnings, have not only not become extinct in this world, but their malicious howls can still be heard across the ocean. The capitalist world has fallen into a serious economic crisis, and the imperialist reactionaries are using the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, supporting the revival of fascism, the Tito spy organization, and other means to save capitalism and realize the world domination of American and British imperialism. But the progress of history is relentless. Comrade Stalin warned the imperialists at the 17th Congress of our Party: "There is no doubt that a second war against the Soviet Union will lead the aggressors to complete defeat, and will cause revolutions in several countries in Europe and Asia and the destruction of the bourgeois-landlord governments in those countries." The results of the Second World War confirmed the predictions of our great leader Stalin to the slightest detail. If imperialism ignores the lessons of history and imposes a third world war on mankind, there is no doubt that this war will end the dying existence of the capitalist world. The guarantee of this is the power of the Soviet Union, the fraternal cooperation of the peoples of all countries advancing along the socialist road, the Communist Party tempered in battle, and the great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

　　Voroshilov concluded his speech amidst stormy cheers and shouts of "Hurrah," saying: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls for the continued strengthening of the Soviet armed forces. Long live our glorious Soviet army! The Soviet voters, who have been integrated into a unified Stalinist team to accomplish their noble tasks, will vote for the candidates of the Party and the Non-Party League in the election. Let me merge my love for Stalin with your deep feelings. Long live the glorious people of Soviet Belarus! Glory to Stalin!

　　斯大林党与非党联盟候选人
    什维尔尼克等发表演说受到各地选民热烈拥护
    【本报讯】据新华社北京十一日电：塔斯社斯维德洛夫斯克讯：此间选民在三月一日和他们的最高苏维埃民族院代表候选人什维尔尼克会晤。许多科学家在会上发言，热烈拥护什维尔尼克并号召投他的票。大会在热情高涨中通电斯大林致敬。
    什维尔尼克在大会上发表讲演，向选民表示感谢，并保证将实践选民对他的信托。（什维尔尼克演说全文，见明日本报第五版）
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社明斯克讯：明斯克市选区的选民，七日和他们的最高苏维埃联盟院代表候选人、苏联元帅伏罗希洛夫举行盛大集会。伏罗希洛夫器械制造厂的斯塔哈诺夫式工人，斯大林奖金获奖诗人和艺术家，科学家，红军将领等多人发言热烈拥护伏罗希洛夫并号召选民投他的票。大会热烈通过给白俄罗斯人民最好的朋友斯大林的贺电。
    伏罗希洛夫在不断的掌声与欢呼声中发表长篇演讲。他首先感谢选民对他的信任，并称这种荣誉应归功于伟大的斯大林。
    伏罗希洛夫称：生活和工作在斯大林时代的人们有无比的好运，继承马克思和恩格斯事业的天才——列宁和斯大林，已把马克思主义的伟大学说变为活生生的现实。
    伏罗希洛夫追述在伟大爱国战争中，苏联人民从法西斯野蛮统治下拯救了全世界的伟大胜利，并叙述苏联今天在历史上第一次与友好的兄弟民族有着绵长的共同边境。他说：这些成就有重大的政治的和国际的重要性，是我们英勇人民在列宁——斯大林党的领导下获得的。虽然我们在战争中遭受了巨大牺牲，但今日已在国民经济的恢复、提高与增长上获得巨大成就。伏罗希洛夫在讲述战后五年计划头四年中工、农业的成就时，特别提出曾被德国法西斯占领的白俄罗斯的成就称：白俄罗斯英雄的人民已使企业、城市和集体农场恢复得和新的一样。许多工业出品如泥炭、水泥等，已大大超过战前水平，重要农作物的收获已达战前水平，学校和学生的人数已超过战前水平，集体农场中已建筑了四十五万幢房屋和数千所文化机关。只有在布尔什维克党的领导下，才能在这样短的时间医好战争创伤。今天在苏联，每五个人中就有一个人在学校里学习，这是我们最伟大的成就，旧时代的梦想已成为现实了。
    伏罗希洛夫演说帝国主义如敢发动第三次世界大战，资本主义垂死的存在就要结束！
    伏罗希洛夫继讲述了苏联文学艺术和科学发明方面的成就，并称：苏联科学已解决了原子能的秘密，苏联有自己的原子弹，从而结束了帝国主义者的原子讹诈。在讲述国际形势时，伏罗希洛夫讲到列宁和斯大林关于社会主义与资本主义可能长期并存的指示，并称这一贯地表达了苏联人民要确保人类和平与安全的希望。伏罗希洛夫引证斯大林一九四八年五月答复华莱士的公开信中所说：两种制度的同时存在以及苏联与美国间分歧意见的和平解决，不仅是可能的，而且也是绝对必要的。苏联的外交政策和外交行动，便是始终不变地遵循着这些指示。伏罗希洛夫说：斯大林同志在我党第十七次代表大会的报告中曾说：“我们是主张并拥护和平事业的，可是我们并不害怕威胁，那些敢于侵犯我们的人，就会受到粉碎性的还击，教训他们以后再也不敢把猪鼻子伸到我们苏维埃花园里来。”现在苏联和人民民主国家正在百花怒放，但猪鼻子却不顾警告，不但没有在这世界上灭绝，并且远隔重洋还听得到它恶意的嗥叫。资本主义世界已陷入严重的经济危机，帝国主义反动派不择手段地用马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约、扶植法西斯复活、铁托间谍机关等等，来挽救资本主义并实现美英帝国主义的世界统治。但历史的前进是无情的，斯大林同志在我党第十七次代表大会上警告帝国主义者说：“毫无疑问地，反对苏联的第二次大战将使侵略者们走向完全失败，将引起欧亚两洲若干国家的革命和那些国家中资产阶级——地主政府的毁灭”。第二次世界大战的结果，毫厘不爽地证实了我们伟大领袖斯大林的预见。如果帝国主义不顾历史教训，把第三次大战加诸人类，毫无疑问这次大战将结束资本主义世界垂死的存在。这一点的保证就是苏联的威力，沿着社会主义道路前进的各国人民的兄弟般的合作，在战斗中久经锻炼的共产党和伟大的领袖与导师斯大林同志。
    伏罗希洛夫在暴风雨般的欢呼与乌拉声中结束其演讲称：苏联共产党中央委员会号召继续加强苏联武装部队，我们光荣的苏联军队万岁！为完成崇高任务已溶成一支统一的斯大林主义的队伍的苏维埃选民，将在选举中投党与非党联盟候选人的票。让我把我对斯大林的敬爱和你们深厚的感情溶合起来吧，苏维埃白俄罗斯的光荣人民万岁！光荣归于斯大林！
