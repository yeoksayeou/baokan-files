    Integrate Technical Research with Mass Production
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Agricultural Technology Work Conference successfully concluded on the 9th. In order to study and improve agricultural technology work and assist in completing the grain and cotton production increase plan, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened the North China Agricultural Technology Work Conference in Beijing from February 24th. Attendees included: responsible technical cadres from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the North China Agricultural Experiment Station, the agricultural departments and farms of the five provinces of North China, as well as representatives from the Northeast and Northwest, professors from agricultural universities, model farmers, and veteran peasants, totaling more than 180 people. Soviet agricultural experts also attended. The conference lasted two weeks. After introducing the work situation in various places, group discussions (technical administration, experimental research, breeding and promotion, pest and disease control, animal husbandry, fruit trees, etc. in six groups), regional discussions, reviewed past work, determined the policy of closely integrating experimental research work with the production of the peasant masses, formulated a plan for the reasonable adjustment of technical administrative institutions, and appropriately resolved the coordination and division of labor among experimental research, technical promotion, and administrative work. A specific plan for popularizing improved varieties (main crops) and preventing and controlling pests and diseases in the North China region over five years was drafted. In the summary report, Deputy Minister Yang particularly pointed out: Everyone should thoroughly implement the spirit of the conference among all technical workers and the peasant masses. In the future, it is necessary to organize forces to lead technical improvement work as a mass movement. He also emphasized that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the political study of technical personnel and the study of Michurin's theory in order to better serve the people. In his closing remarks, Minister Li also instructed everyone that production and disaster relief are still extremely important in agricultural work, and we must redouble our efforts to help farmers in disaster areas overcome the famine.
