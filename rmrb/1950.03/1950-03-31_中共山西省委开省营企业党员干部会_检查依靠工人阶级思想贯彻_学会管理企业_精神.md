Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Taiyuan: The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of Party member cadres from provincial-owned companies, factories, and mines from the 4th to the 7th of this month. The meeting focused on reviewing the erroneous concepts of democratization of management in the minds of cadres in various factories and mines. This is the beginning of Shanxi Province's state-owned industrial and mining enterprises examining and improving their business management in accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises." The meeting indicated that the main obstacle to the thorough realization of democratization of management is the insufficient understanding of relying on the working class among cadres in various factories and mines. There are 56 state-owned enterprises in the province, but only 25 have established factory management committees and employee representative assemblies, and among these, 12 are merely formalities. Regarding the issue of democratization of management, various confused understandings exist among cadres in factories and mines: some believe that workers are "backward" and can only be relied upon after a long period of education; some believe that only a small portion or only certain matters can be relied upon; others believe that implementing democracy is too troublesome and inefficient; and some even believe that the bourgeoisie "managed" factories well without relying on workers, and there would be no harm in using this method if we have no other choice. The existence of the above-mentioned confused ideas has prevented many serious abnormal states in Taiyuan's general state-owned enterprises from being overcome quickly. During the discussion, many cadres made self-criticisms of the confused ideas that existed. Finally, Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a conclusion. In his conclusion, he pointed out that the root cause of these confused ideas is that many cadres do not understand the essential difference between people's enterprises and bourgeois enterprises, and do not understand that mobilizing workers to participate in management is the most reliable guarantee for running people's enterprises well.
    Simultaneously with the publication of the above news, the Shanxi Daily published an editorial, pointing out that in order to improve the management of factories and enterprises, in addition to requiring all cadres in factories and enterprises to follow the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" and clearly establish the concept of relying on the working class, the following three points must be specifically achieved: (1) Quickly and effectively establish factory management committees and employee representative assemblies to implement a democratic management system; (2) In the process of implementing democratization of management, systematically and purposefully strengthen the education of employees to improve their political awareness and cultural level; (3) Enterprise administration should regularly care about production safety equipment and employee welfare. The editorial emphasized that the idea of not relying on the working class is closely linked to the work style of bureaucracy, so it is necessary to strengthen criticism and self-criticism to overcome the bureaucratic work style. The Communist Party, Youth League branches, trade unions, and administration in factories must unite and resolutely overcome uncoordinated tendencies and make unremitting efforts for a common goal.

　　中共山西省委开省营企业党员干部会
    检查依靠工人阶级思想贯彻“学会管理企业”精神
    【新华社二十九日讯】太原讯：中国共产党山西省委会于本月四日至七日召开的省营公司、厂、矿的党员干部会议，曾着重地检讨了目前各厂矿干部思想中对于管理民主化的错误观念。这是山西省公营工矿企业根据人民日报的“学会管理企业”社论的精神来检查和改进企业经营管理工作的开始。会议表明：管理民主化彻底实现的主要障碍是各厂矿干部对于依靠工人阶级认识不足。全省省营企业有五十六个单位，但成立了工厂管理委员会和职工代表会的仅二十五个单位，其中尚有十二个是流于形式。对于管理民主化问题，各厂矿干部中存在着种种糊涂认识：有的认为工人“落后”，必须经过长期教育后才能依靠；有的认为只能依靠一小部分或是只有某些事才能依靠；也有的认为实行民主太麻烦，做事不痛快；甚至还有人认为资产阶级不依靠工人也“办好”了工厂，我们在没有办法的情况下，用一下这种办法也没有什么坏处。上述种种糊涂观念的存在就使得太原一般省营企业中许多严重的不正常状态未能迅速得到克服。在讨论中不少干部曾对存在着的糊涂思想作了自我批评。最后，由中共山西省委副书记赖若愚作结论。他在结论中指出这些糊涂观念的根源是许多干部不懂得人民企业与资产阶级企业的本质的区别，不懂得发动工人参加管理是办好人民企业的最可靠的保证。
    与发表上述消息同时，山西日报发表社论，指出要使工厂企业经营管理工作提高一步，除了要求工厂企业中一切干部依照人民日报的“学会管理企业”社论的精神，明确树立依靠工人阶级的观念外，必须具体做到以下三点：（一）迅速地切实地建立工厂管理委员会和职工代表会，实行民主的管理制度；（二）在实施管理民主化过程中，有系统有计划地加强对职工的教育，以提高其政治觉悟与文化水平；（三）企业行政应经常关心生产安全设备及职工福利。社论着重指出，不依靠工人阶级的思想与官僚主义的工作作风是密切结合着的，因此必须加强批评与自我批评，克服官僚主义作风。工厂中共产党、青年团的支部、工会和行政必须团结一致，坚决克服不协调倾向，为着共同的目的作不懈的努力。
