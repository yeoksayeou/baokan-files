Reforming Teaching Work at Beijing Normal University
    Chao Yongguang · Li Zhong

    Organization and Leadership of Learning
    Organizing teachers' learning is one of the central aspects of reforming teaching at present. After the start of the semester last semester, Beijing Normal University established a Learning Committee under the personal leadership of the school principal, responsible for leading the teachers' learning. In terms of learning content, it shifted from general political study in the previous semester to a combination of political and professional study, gradually permeating political theory into teaching to achieve the goal of reforming teaching, and strengthening the political and ideological education of teachers through professional study. In terms of methods, individual study was the main focus, combined with enlightening reports, summary reports, and group discussions. For the convenience of self-study, the school specially set up a teacher's study room, which contained many books, newspapers, and magazines for reference at any time. Teachers spent their spare time reading and preparing lessons there, making it everyone's "second home."

    Changes in Teaching Attitude and Perspective
    Organizing teachers' learning is not simply about teaching techniques or general political theory, but about transforming teaching through professional and political study—first and foremost, the transformation of teaching perspectives and attitudes. Generally speaking, teachers at Beijing Normal University have undergone fundamental changes in their teaching attitudes after a year of study. For example, an art teacher who had taught for twenty years, lecturing on *Dream of the Red Chamber* for twenty years (in his own words), would only come to class, leave after class, and had not entered the auditorium for many years. Now, not only does he not lecture on *Dream of the Red Chamber* in class, but he has also become one of the most active members of the faculty, treating the school as his own, serving as a grade leader, staying with the students every day, and not even going home on Saturdays. Another example is a music teacher who had worked very hard in teaching in the past, but not only did he not receive encouragement from the administrative side, but he was also ridiculed by the reactionary administration. Now, because he received enthusiastic help and encouragement from the administrative leaders, he was greatly moved. He said, "Now is the time for me to truly dedicate myself to the cause." Not only did he work hard in teaching, but he also led students to personally repair the organ, create xylophones, and enrich teaching aids.

    In terms of teaching viewpoints, concepts such as "education for education's sake," "educational aloofness," "education to save the country," and employment viewpoints have gradually changed, and they are ideologically preparing to apply new viewpoints to the curriculum. Math and science teachers have also realized that math and science also serve politics.

    Professional Improvement and Transformation
    In professional study, on the one hand, we arranged documents such as "Transforming Our Learning" and "Smashing the Old System," calling on everyone to transform the teaching methods that were divorced from the past and reality in the spirit of consistency and combination of theory and practice. On the other hand, we extensively solicited students' opinions on the curriculum, held forums for student representatives from all grades, held forums for teachers from the affiliated primary school, and conveyed Minister Qian's summary report at the National Education Workers Conference.

    Due to the study of theory and current educational policies, and due to the extensive and in-depth opinions of students and teachers of the affiliated primary school on the current curriculum, an atmosphere of reforming the old education has been created at Beijing Normal University today. Teachers deeply feel that they will not be able to keep up with the development of the objective situation if they do not study hard. As one teacher said, "In the past, I never prepared carefully for teaching, but students never raised any opinions; now I spend several times more time preparing lessons than before, but students have more opinions, which shows that students' learning attitude is serious today." A teacher who teaches measurement statistics, because most students reflected that the subject was not practical at present, therefore, in the discussion of the curriculum for the next semester, he automatically advocated that the subject should be cancelled.

    Existing Problems and Several Experiences
    From the process of leading teachers' learning and reforming teaching, we deeply realize that this is an arduous and meticulous task. First of all, teaching viewpoints cannot be changed all at once. Many teachers are still unable to truly listen to others' opinions with an open mind. For example, a Chinese teacher refused students' reasonable request to teach some punctuation marks and practical writing, thinking that it was too superficial and not worth teaching. Some teachers generally accept the theory of reforming teaching, but are not easily receptive when it comes to the specific transformation of a certain course.

    Secondly, the difficulty of teaching materials may not be solved for a while. The teaching materials for many courses are still old and do not meet the current needs, and our teachers are limited by their political level and cannot conduct criticism. Even if there are more suitable teaching materials, teachers often swallow them whole and are unable to make full use of them for education, or even do a very bad job.

    Thirdly, even if the political level is sufficient, it is not enough if the cultural level is not sufficient. One teacher is in this situation, and as a result, students reflect that there is too much politics in the teaching, which has become a political class and is not very welcomed.

    Therefore, in principle, we are sure that reforming teaching is necessary, but due to the limitations of many current conditions, we cannot be impatient, and we must also act prudently on specific issues.

　　北师改造教学工作
    晁涌光·李中
    学习的组织和领导
    组织教员学习是目前改造教学的中心环节之一。北京师范上学期开学以后，在该校校长亲自领导之下成立了学习委员会，负责领导教员的学习。在学习的内容上，由前学期一般的政治学习进入政治和业务结合的学习，逐渐把政治理论渗透到教学上，达到改造教学的目的，并通过业务学习加强对教员的政治思想教育。在方式上以个人学习为主，结合着启发报告、总结报告和小组讨论进行。为了自学的方便，学校特别设置了一个教员学习室，里边有很多书报杂志，以备随时查阅。教师们课余都到那里读书和准备功课，成为大家的“第二家庭”。
    教学态度和观点的改变
    组织教员学习不是单纯的教学技术或一般政治理论的学习，而是通过业务和政治的学习改造教学——首先是教学观点与教学态度的改造。一般的说，北师的教员经过一年的学习，在教学态度上已起了根本变化。如美术教师过去教了二十年书，讲了二十年的红楼梦（用他自己的话），上课才来，下课就走，许多年来没有进过礼堂的门。现在不仅上课不讲红楼梦，而且成为教师中最积极的一员，把学校当作自己的，做了级任，天天与学生在一起，甚至星期六也不回去。又如音乐教师过去在教学上也很努力，但不仅得不到行政上的鼓励，反而受到反动行政当局的冷讽热嘲。现在因为得到行政领导上热情的帮助和鼓励，受了很大感动。他说：“现在真正到了我鞠躬尽瘁的时候了”。不仅教学努力了，而且领导学生亲自修理风琴，创作木琴，充实教具。
    在教学观点上，“为教育而教育”、“教育清高”、“教育救国论”及雇佣观点等已逐渐改变，从思想上准备将新观点运用到课程中去。数理教员也已认识到数理也是为政治服务的。
    业务上的提高和改造
    在业务的学习上，我们一方面布置“改造我们的学习”、“打碎旧的一套”等文件，号召大家在理论与实践一致和结合的精神下改造过去与现实脱离的教学方法。另一方面普遍的征求同学对课程的意见，召开各年级学生代表座谈会，召开附小教员座谈会，传达钱部长在全国教育工作者会议上的总结报告。
    由于理论和当前教育政策的学习，由于学生及附小教员对现在课程广泛深入的提意见，今天在北师改造旧教育的空气已经造成了，教师们深深感到不努力学习将不能赶上客观形势的发展。如某先生说：“过去我教书从没仔细准备过，但学生没提过意见；现在我准备功课比过去多花几倍的时间，而同学的意见倒多起来了，这说明同学们今天的学习态度是认真了。”教测验统计的某先生，由于大多数同学反映该科在目前不切合实际需要，因此在讨论下学期课程时，他自动主张将该科取消。
  现存问题与几点体验
    从领导教员学习和改造教学的过程中，我们深深体验到这是一件艰苦而细腻的工作。首先是教学观点不能一下子改变过来。许多教师还不能真正虚心地听取别人的意见。如某国文先生不答应学生要求讲授一点标点符号和应用文的合理要求，认为那太浅，不值一讲。有的教师虽一般的接受改造教学的理论，但遇到对某种课程的具体改造时则不易接受。
    其次，教材的困难一时恐怕还不能解决。许多课程的教材仍是旧的，不适合目前的需要，我们的教师又限于政治水平，不能进行批判。即有较适合的教材，教员也多是生吞活剥，不能充分运用进行教育，甚或进行得很坏。
    第三，即使政治水平够，但文化水平不够也不行。有一位先生就是这种情形，结果在进行教学时学生反映政治太多，成了政治课，也不甚表欢迎。
    所以，改造教学在原则上我们是肯定非改造不可，但由于目前许多条件的限制，使我们不能急躁，在具体问题上也要审慎行事。
