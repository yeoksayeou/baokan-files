The Saar Question

　　The Saar is located in southwestern Germany, with an area of 1,924 square kilometers and a population of 880,000. The Saar is one of Germany's important industrial areas. It is estimated that the Saar has coal reserves of 9 billion tons. Before the war, the annual coal production was 15 million tons, accounting for more than 6% of Germany's total production. The Saar's steel industry is also well-developed. Before the war, the annual steel production was 2 million tons, accounting for about 10% of Germany's total production. The capital of the Saar is Saarbrücken, an important industrial city.

　　After World War II, the Saar was incorporated into the French occupation zone. Since then, the French occupying authorities have set up their own customs posts, controlled currency, and economically turned the Saar into a province of France. At the same time, the United States used it as a means of manipulating capitalists in both France and Germany. As early as April 1947, the United States and Britain violated the Soviet-American-British-French four-power agreement on German issues and unilaterally concluded an agreement with France, imposing a so-called "temporary statute" on the Saar, stipulating that the Saar had so-called "political autonomy," while economically it was incorporated into France. On February 19, 1948, the United States, Britain, and France officially announced that the Saar was completely incorporated into France economically. The price France paid was accepting the US and British rule over the Ruhr, agreeing to reduce demands for reparations from Germany, and participating in the joint occupation zone.

　　On the one hand, the United States announced its support for France's demands on the Saar. On the other hand, it instigated its West German lackeys to come forward and oppose France's demands. The United States attempts to use this double-dealing tactic to confuse public opinion, manipulate France, encourage German revanchism, and drive French and German capitalists to jointly implement a greedy plan of American big capital, which is to combine the Ruhr, Saar, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, the heart of Central Europe's heavy industry, into a large military-industrial base under American control, to serve its ultimate goals of plunder and military expansion.

### 萨尔问题

　　萨尔问题
    萨尔位于德国的西南部，面积有一千九百二十四方公里，人口有八十八万。萨尔是德国的重要工业区之一。据估计：萨尔的煤藏量达九十亿吨，大战前，煤的年产量为一千五百万吨，约为全德总产量的百分之六强。萨尔的钢铁业也很发达，战前，年产钢二百万吨，约占全德总产量的百分之十。萨尔的首府是萨尔布律根，为一重要工业城市。
    第二次大战以后，萨尔划入法占区。从那时以来，法国占领当局即自设关卡，控制货币，在经济上把萨尔变成法国的一个省。同时，美国则把它作为操纵法德两国资本家的手段之一。早在一九四七年四月间，美英两国即违反苏美英法四国关于德国问题的协议，和法国单独成立协定，给萨尔强加一个所谓“临时法规”，规定萨尔有所谓“政治自主”，而在经济上则并入法国。一九四八年二月十九日，美英法三国又正式宣布萨尔在经济上完全并入法国。法国作为代价的是接受了美英对鲁尔的统治，并同意减少对德赔偿的要求和参加联合占领区。
    美国一方面宣布支持法国对萨尔的要求，另一方面，却又唆使它的西德从仆出面，反对法国的要求。美国企图用这种两面手法，迷惑舆论，摆布法国，鼓励德国的复仇主义，驱使法德资本家一起执行美国大资本的一个贪婪的计划，即是把鲁尔、萨尔、洛林及卢森堡这一中欧重工业的心脏地带合而为一，变成美国控制下的一大兵工基地，以符其掠夺及军事扩张的最终目的。（新华社）
