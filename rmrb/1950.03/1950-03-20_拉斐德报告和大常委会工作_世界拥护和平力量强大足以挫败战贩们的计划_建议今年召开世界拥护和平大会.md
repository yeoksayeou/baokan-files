　　Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 19th: TASS reports: John Lafargue, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Congress for Peace, delivered a report on the activities of the Standing Committee of the World Congress for Peace since its last meeting at the meeting on the morning of March 16th. Lafargue said: At the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress for Peace held in Rome in October 1949, two basic factors that characterize the current situation were discussed. The first of these two factors is the consolidation of the peace movement in all countries, and the second is the accelerated preparation for war, which is particularly evident in the expansion of armaments and the entry into force of military pacts. Lafargue pointed out: Although the strengthening of the peace front does weaken the forces for war, this by no means implies that the danger of war has been lessened. Until the warmongers are finally forced to retreat in the face of the forces of peace, we will always have this growing danger as we fight for peace. At the Rome meeting, we advocated consistently expanding the peace movement and giving it an indestructible force capable of forcing the warmongers to bow to peace. This is to advocate to the parliaments of all countries to discuss our peace proposals, which are supported and endorsed by all nations. In the initial stage, we set ourselves the following two goals: disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, which are necessary conditions for dealing with problems peacefully.

　　After Lafargue drew the audience's attention to the current state of the arms race in capitalist countries, he pointed out: The continuous arms race in capitalist countries is leading to a new war. The arms race was the precursor to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars. Lafargue said: War provocateurs are now employing new scare tactics, touting the threat of so-called "super bombs" everywhere, just like selling goods. Lafargue pointed out: According to the Washington Post of the United States, there is a germ warfare experimental station in the suburbs of Washington, and Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, one of the main Japanese war criminals who was engaged in preparing for germ warfare, recently "mysteriously disappeared." All of this proves that the possibility of launching a germ warfare exists, just like the possibility of atomic warfare.

　　Lafargue pointed out: In view of the imminent danger of a new war breaking out, increasingly broad strata of society are shocked and uneasy about it. People who were silent not long ago are now shouting to defend peace. In the United States, fifteen hundred physicists have called on President Truman to pursue a different policy. Peace advocates in various countries are stepping up their anti-war activities. The struggle for peace is now taking on new forms. The working class is making a resolute contribution to this struggle. Dockworkers in France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands refuse to unload arms. Other workers are following their heroic example. Railway workers refuse to transport arms, industrial workers refuse to manufacture arms, and the people support this movement.

　　Lafargue continued: The Standing Committee now includes representatives from the national peace committees of fifty-two countries and maintains contact with democratic organizations in twenty-nine other countries. Before the Rome meeting of the Committee, nineteen countries had already held peace congresses. Since the Rome meeting, eight more countries have held congresses, and eleven more countries are currently preparing for such congresses. Currently, a broad movement for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons is underway in more than forty countries. The peace movement is rapidly developing in Italy, Central European countries, France, the Soviet Union, China, Japan, India, Australia, Africa, the Near East, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Argentina and Canada. However, in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and some Scandinavian countries, the peace movement has not developed in accordance with all the possibilities available in these countries. He emphasized that we believe this is due to incorrect estimates of the danger of war, the means of fighting against war, and the nature of our movement itself. Lafargue said that it is now necessary to loudly announce to everyone: "War can be avoided." War must be avoided, and there are powerful forces in the world sufficient to thwart the plans of the warmongers. Our movement is the spokesman for this great force. He proposed that the Standing Committee recommend convening a new World Congress for Peace this year.

　　In conclusion, Lafargue stated: The forces for peace are constantly growing. The liberation of China, the proclamation of the German Democratic Republic, and the tremendous growth of the peace movement in almost all countries allow us to assert that almost half of the world's population has now joined the great struggle for peace. Never in human history has there been a movement as large as the movement for peace. What people have dreamed of for centuries has now become possible. We will jointly win the victory in this battle—the noblest of all battles. At that time, the day of human friendship and affection will dawn all over the world!

　　拉斐德报告和大常委会工作
    世界拥护和平力量强大足以挫败战贩们的计划
    建议今年召开世界拥护和平大会
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会总书记约翰·拉斐德，于三月十六日上午的会议上，发表了关于世界拥护和平大会常设委员会自上次会议以来的活动的报告。拉斐德说：在一九四九年十月在罗马举行的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的会议上，曾经讨论过作为目前形势之特性的两个基本因素。这两个因素中的第一个，是一切国家中和平运动的巩固，第二个是加速准备战争，这特别表现在扩充军备与军事公约的生效上。拉斐德指出：虽然和平阵线的加强的确削弱了战争方面的力量，但是这绝不意味着战争危险就已告减轻。在战争贩子没有最后被迫在和平力量的面前退却以前，我们在为和平而斗争时，将始终有着这种日渐增长的危险。在罗马会议上我们曾倡议始终不渝地扩大和平运动，并且使它具有一种能够迫使战争贩子向和平低头的不可摧毁的力量。这就是向各国议会倡议，讨论我们的为一切民族所支持与赞成的和平建议。在最初阶段，我们给自己定出了下列两个目标：裁减军备与禁止原子武器，这是以和平方式处理问题的必要条件。
    拉斐德在请听众注意到目前在资本主义国家中所进行的军备竞赛的情形后指出：资本主义各国不断的军备竞赛，正导向新的战争。军备竞赛曾是第一次与第二次世界大战爆发的前驱。拉斐德说：战争挑拨者目前正采用新的吓诈，就象推销商品一样地到处大吹大擂所谓“超级炸弹”的威胁。拉斐德指出：据美国的华盛顿邮报称，在华盛顿近郊，就设有一个细菌实验站，而曾从事准备细菌战的主要日本战犯之一的石井四郎中将，最近却突然“神秘地失踪了”。所有这一切证明目前存在着发动细菌战的可能性，就象原子战的可能性一样。
    拉斐德指出：鉴于新战争爆发的迫近的危险，社会上愈来愈广泛的阶层都为之震惊不安。不久以前还是保持沉默的人们，现在也在高呼保卫和平了。在美国，有一千五百位物理学家要求杜鲁门总统奉行另一种政策。各国的和平拥护者们都在加紧他们的反战活动。争取和平的斗争，现在已经采取新的方式。工人阶级对于这一斗争正作着坚决的贡献。法国、意大利、比利时与荷兰的码头工人，拒绝卸运军火。其他工人也效法他们的英勇榜样。铁路工人拒绝运输军火，产业工人拒绝制造军火，人民也都支持这一运动。
    拉斐德继称：现在常设委员会包括有五十二个国家全国和平委员会的代表，并与其他二十九个国家的民主组织保持接触。在委员会罗马会议以前，已经有十九个国家举行了拥护和平大会。罗马会议以后又有八个国家举行了大会，现在还有十一个国家正在筹备这样的大会。目前裁减军备和禁止原子武器的广泛运动，正在四十多个国家里进行。和平运动在意大利、中欧各国、法国、苏联、中国、日本、印度、澳大利亚、非洲、近东、巴西、委内瑞拉、古巴、阿根廷和加拿大迅速发展。但是，在某些国家里，如英国、美国和一些斯堪的纳维亚国家，拥护和平运动却没有按照这些国家里所有的可能性发展起来。他着重指出，我们以为这是由于对战争危险、反抗战争的斗争手段以及我们运动的性质本身，存在着不正确的估计。拉斐德说，告诉所有的人：“战争是可以避免的”，现在已有高声宣布的必要了。战争必须予以避免，而且世界上已有强大的力量足以挫败战争贩子们的计划。我们的运动就是这一伟大力量的发言人。他提出常设委员会建议在今年召开新的世界拥护和平大会。
    拉斐德在结论中称：和平的力量正在不断增长。中国的解放、德意志民主共和国的宣告成立，以及差不多所有国家里和平运动的巨大成长，使我们可以断言，现在几乎全世界一半的人口已参加了争取和平的伟大斗争。人类历史上从不曾有过象争取和平运动这样壮大的运动。人们几世纪以来所梦想的东西，现在已经变成可能的了。我们将共同赢得这个战斗的胜利——这是一切战斗中最崇高的战斗。那时，人类亲睦友爱的日子将在全世界破晓！
