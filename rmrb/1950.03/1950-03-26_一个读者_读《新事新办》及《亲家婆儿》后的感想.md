    Reflections of a Reader After Reading "New Things Done in a New Way" and "The Mother-in-Law"
    Yu Shu
    The 39th issue of "People's Literature" published two short stories, "New Things Done in a New Way" by Gu Yu and "The Mother-in-Law" by Zhai Shulei. These are works by two unknown literary workers, yet they have considerable achievements, leaving a deep impression on us after reading them.
    As the editor's note says, these two short stories "through the realistic and vivid depiction of rural life and customs, show the contradictions and changes between the old and new things, the old and new ideas in the old liberated areas: the old is disappearing, and the new is growing." Judging from these two works, this editor's note is appropriate.
    "New Things Done in a New Way" describes the growth of a new atmosphere in the countryside through the simple story of whether the woman should bring dowry in the marriage of Wang Guide and Fenglan, and also gives a good explanation of the old customs.
    Fenglan's father originally planned to sell some grain to buy dowry for his daughter, and later planned to sell the calf to buy more dowry, but all were rejected by Fenglan, the "production model," precisely because: "In these days of liberated people, who doesn't have a cabinet or wardrobe, what's the use of those things? They can't plow the fields or pull the plow. Besides, where would you wear fancy clothes? It's not like before, when a daughter-in-law didn't work in the fields for three years. We have to work in the fields as soon as we enter the family, who has time to apply powder and rouge? Guilde is a district cadre, he wouldn't allow it either..."
    What about Guilde? His mother said, "Her family is so rich, but there's no dowry at all..." Although Guilde explained it, the old lady was unhappy. When the villagers asked why the new daughter-in-law didn't bring a dowry, she "stammered and couldn't say anything, and hid away, blushing."
    However, the old customs and old ideas that the elderly cannot completely abandon are solved in a new way—the calf is regarded as a dowry. On the one hand, it avoids unnecessary waste, and on the other hand, it solves the problem that Guilde's family originally had no livestock. "Responding to economy" and "engaging in production" are well resolved in this "newly done" wedding. Guilde's mother is also happy with this new dowry. The new society has taught them to "become rich through production," and of course, they are happy to use production tools as dowry. She changed from "stammering" to "being so happy that she just wanted to laugh."
    The transformation of the old customs here is described vividly and specifically. Through it, readers can see how farmers in the new countryside value production. Although the elderly still retain some old customs and old ideas, the new methods naturally change these old customs and old ideas.
    Slightly different from Guilde's mother is the mother of Xiaoguo in "The Mother-in-Law." She is an old widow who "hasn't seen much" of the new world. When her daughter Xiaoguo is about to give birth, the mother-in-law happens to get sick and comes to the daughter's family to take care of her during childbirth, but she is "always pouting her mouth as if someone owes her two hundred coins," always complaining that Xiaoguo's mother-in-law doesn't treat her daughter well. When Xiaoguo explains that it's not the case, she "wipes her tears with the edge of her clothes and says, 'You young people don't understand anything, it's been like this for generations.'"
    The facts told her that things that were "like this for generations" are different now. The relationship between the sisters-in-law is so close, and the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is also very considerate. Her old vision began to lose its effectiveness. On the contrary, "her happy eyes smiled into two crescent moons," "she only felt that her mother-in-law was too close."
    The story is also very simple, just describing some rural customs and habits, but it points out: the old is disappearing, and the new is growing!
    There is no doubt that these two works are pleasant and lovely to read.
    Of course, these are not perfect works. These two short stories basically tell readers two fresh and happy things; however, the description of the characters and the more reasonable and perfect development of the story are still somewhat lacking. For example, the description of the qualities and characteristics of Guilde, the district cadre, in "New Things Done in a New Way" is insufficient. In "The Mother-in-Law," it is also unreasonable that Xiaoguo's mother is "rarely interested in outside affairs" even after two years of liberation in the city, and her mind hasn't changed at all. Although she is a bit deaf, her daily life must involve contact with the masses, and she cannot be completely isolated from the surrounding world. At the same time, the final transitions in the two works are too fast and somewhat abrupt, especially Xiaoguo's mother, who held onto her prejudices for a long time and quickly changed her mind after seeing only a few scenes. The description is still not enough.
    Although there are still some shortcomings, it cannot be denied that they are quite excellent works, especially the familiarity with rural affairs and rural language, which can only be gained through experiencing rural life.
    At the same time, we must not forget that the two authors are still unknown literary workers today, and there are many such literary workers scattered among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are working with unparalleled enthusiasm, so they must be discovered, helped, promoted, and cultivated. This is a major task in the current literary work, and neglecting this point will harm the development of the literary movement.
    In the past, due to being in a scattered environment, this aspect of work was not given enough attention, that is to say, not enough help was given to a large number of young literary workers. In the future, in the process of building a new China, literary work, as part of the people's cause, plays a huge role in education and propaganda. Therefore, we ask the literary circles to pay attention to this aspect of work, and at the same time, we hope that the party committees at all levels in factories, rural areas, and the army will care for this group of young literary workers and actively help and cultivate them.

    读《新事新办》及《亲家婆儿》后的感想
    曰术
    《人民文艺》第三十九期刊载了谷峪的《新事新办》及翟树雷的《亲家婆儿》两个短篇创作。这是两个不知名的文艺工作者的作品，然而它却有相当优秀的成就，读后使我们留下了深刻的印象。
    正如编者按语中所说，这两个短篇“通过农村生活与风习的真实生动的描写，显示出老解放区农村中新旧事物、新旧思想之间的矛盾和变化：旧的正在消逝，新的正在成长。”从这两个作品来看，这段按语是恰当的。
    《新事新办》通过王贵德与凤兰结婚中女方有没有陪送这个简单的故事，描写出农村中一种新气象的成长，同时对旧习俗也作了很好的说服。
    凤兰的爹原来盘算着粜多少粮食，给闺女买什么嫁妆，后来又盘算把小牛卖掉，再买陪送，然而都被“生产模范”的凤兰拒绝了，正因为：“这年头翻身的人家儿，谁没个柜子橱的，那东西有啥用？不能耕地，不能拉犁，再说花衣裳上那穿？现在可不象从前，做媳妇三年不下地，咱到人家门就得下地生产，谁还有工夫擦粉抹胭脂的？贵德是个区干部，他更不让这么办，……”
    贵德呢？他娘说：“她娘家过的那么富裕，就一点陪送也没有……”虽经贵德加以解说，但老人心里是不愉快的，当乡亲们问起新媳妇为什么没有陪送时，她就“张口结舌的说不上个什么来，硬着耳根子臊着躲开了”。
    然而，为老年人所还不能完全抛开的旧习俗旧思想，是以一个新的方法解决了——把小牛当作了陪送，一方面免得作多余的浪费，另一方面又替贵德家解决了原来没有牲口的问题，“响应节约”和“搞生产”在这个《新事新办》的婚礼里是获得了很好的解决。贵德的娘对这新的嫁妆也是喜悦的，新社会教育了她们“生产发家”，拿生产工具来作陪送，当然是欢欣的。她由“张口结舌”变成了“乐得光想笑”。
    这里面对旧风气的转变，描写得很生动、具体，透过它，读者可以看出新农村里的农民是如何重视生产，老年人虽然还残留着一些旧习俗旧思想，但新的办法使这些旧习俗旧思想自然而然地改变了。
    和贵德的娘略有不同的《亲家婆儿》里的小果的娘，她是个对新世道“没有见识多少”的老寡妇，在她女儿小果要生孩子的时候，偏偏婆婆闹起病来而到了亲家的家里，来照顾女儿的生孩子，但是她“老是噘着嘴象谁短她二百钱似的”嘟嘟念念的，总是嫌小果婆婆待女儿不好，小果解释不是那么回事时，她“用衣襟一边儿擦泪，一边儿说：‘你们年轻人懂啥，多少辈子都是这样儿。’”
    事实告诉了她“多少辈子都是这样儿”的事，现在却不一样，姑妇间多么亲热，婆媳间也很体贴，她的旧眼光开始失掉效用了，相反地，“喜欢的两只眼睛笑成了两个月牙”，“她只觉得她的亲家婆儿太亲近了”。
    故事也非常简单，只不过描写了一些农村中的风俗习惯，然而它是指出了：旧的正在消逝，新的正在成长！
    毫无疑问，这两个作品，读后是感到亲切和可爱的。
    当然，这也并不是完善无缺的作品。这两个短篇基本上是告诉了读者两件新鲜、愉快的事情；而对于人物的描写，故事更合理完美的发展，还嫌有些不够的地方，譬如《新事新办》中对区干部贵德的品质特点的描写是不够的，《亲家婆儿》里的小果的娘对城里解放二年，而她还是“很少打听外面的事”，脑筋一点也没有变，这也不太合理，虽然她有些耳聋，但她日常生活必然要接触群众，不能把她与周围世界完全孤立起来。同时，两个作品对最后的转变也太快，有些突然，尤其是小果的娘，抱了好久的成见，看到很少几个场面就迅速换脑筋，是描写得还是不太够的。
    虽然还存在一些缺点，但不能否认它们是相当优秀的作品，特别是对农村事物和农村语言的熟悉，是体验了农村生活才能有此收获的。
    同时，不能忘记，两个作者在今天都还是不知名的文艺工作者，而这一类散布在广大工农兵群众中的文艺工作者，数量是很多的，他们是以无比的热忱在工作着，因此，必须来发现、帮助、提拔和培养他们。这是当前文艺工作中一个主要任务，对这一点忽视是有损于文艺运动的发展的。
    过去由于处于分散的环境下，因而对这方面的工作没有好好重视，也就是说，对大量青年文艺工作者的帮助是不够的。今后，在新中国的建设过程中，文艺工作当作人民事业的一部分，它在教育和宣传上是起着巨大作用的，所以我们要求文艺界重视这方面的工作，同时希望在工厂、农村、部队的各级党委，关心这批青年文艺工作者，积极帮助和培养他们。
                                  一九五○，三，二十一，写于南京。
