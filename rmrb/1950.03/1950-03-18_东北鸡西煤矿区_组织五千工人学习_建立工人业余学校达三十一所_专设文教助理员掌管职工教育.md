　　Northeast Jixi Coal Mining Area
    Organizes Five Thousand Workers to Study
    Establishes Thirty-One Workers' Spare-Time Schools; Appoints Special Cultural and Educational Assistants to Manage Employee Education
    [Our Newspaper] Special Correspondent Lü Yingcai reports: The worker education work in the Northeast Jixi Coal Mining Area has greatly developed. All eight units in the mining area have now established thirty-one employee spare-time schools, with a total of one hundred and two classes. A total of five thousand seven hundred and twenty-one people are participating in the study, accounting for thirty-seven percent of the total number of people in the mining area (15,475). Each coal mining area of the major mines in the district is equipped with cultural and educational assistants, who are specially responsible for employee education. The electrical and mechanical transport workers, mining and excavation workers, and staff of each mine have organized three different types of study classes: electrical and mechanical workers generally have a considerable cultural foundation, so technical learning is the main focus, with politics and culture as supplementary; mining and excavation workers have a lower level of education, so cultural learning is the main focus, with politics and business as supplementary; staff focus on political learning, followed by business learning. All workers' study classes uniformly use the two types of worker textbooks compiled by the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions; electrical and mechanical workers also add drawing, mathematics, and other learning materials. In addition to the cultural and educational assistants, the teachers of the study classes are mostly local primary school teachers and staff and workers with higher levels of education. The study time is determined according to the work situation. For example, engineering and electrical workers study in the morning; pit mining and excavation workers study in the morning, afternoon, and evening depending on their work shifts.
    In the past year, the learning achievements of the general machinery plant and the electrical and mechanical sections of various mines have been better. Because these workers live in concentrated areas, work an eight-hour day, and have a good cultural foundation. Seventy percent of the people in the electrical and mechanical departments of each mine participate in the study, and the general machinery plant reaches eighty-eight percent. Forty-one percent of the students in the general machinery plant's cultural class (formerly illiterate) can now write simple notes and read the Worker's Daily; thirty-five percent have learned one hundred to two hundred and fifty characters and have learned two-digit multiplication at the same time; the rest of the students have learned at least fifty characters. Fewer pit mining and excavation workers participate in the study (accounting for nineteen percent of all mining and excavation workers), and their learning achievements are also worse. In the past year, about twenty-five percent of those who participated in the study learned more than three hundred characters from being illiterate; most people recognized between fifty and three hundred characters; about twenty percent of the people still recognized less than fifty characters, most of whom were older workers.
    In addition to improving their cultural level, workers' political awareness and enthusiasm for labor have also increased with study. The workers of the general machinery plant have the best academic performance, and they are also the most active in carrying out the new record movement. After studying, many workers broke feudal, superstitious, and fatalistic ideas; they initially grasped internationalist thought and broke some of the wrong perceptions of the Soviet Union that had existed in the past due to enemy and puppet deception. When workers mention the Soviet Union, they affectionately call it "Big Brother Soviet Union". On Stalin's 70th birthday, workers from various mines held warm celebrations.
    Based on the experience of the past year, to run formal worker education well, the following issues must be paid attention to:
    The Party, government, labor union, and Youth League must cooperate closely and allocate the time for various tasks appropriately.
    First, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leadership in the mining area must attach importance to worker learning, cooperate closely, and allocate the time for various tasks appropriately, otherwise, it will hinder the normal progress of learning. Individual mines have not done well in this regard. For example, some mines separated the cultural learning of Party and Youth League members from the cultural learning of the masses last autumn, and put forward the slogan "Eliminate illiteracy within the Party within the year." As a result, the masses' learning lost its core, and the study classes collapsed. Some mines held meetings during study time when openly establishing the Party, which caused the study classes to be suspended for more than a month. Then, new Party members took Party classes, which affected the reorganized study classes. The masses are very dissatisfied. Some mine administrative cadres use study classes to convey work-related matters, speak a lot during class, and take up a long time for workers to study, making workers feel that they cannot learn anything in class, which affects their learning enthusiasm.
    Second, to organize workers to study, it is necessary to implement the spirit of education serving production and to promote it through organization in a planned way. In the past, the Jixi Coal Mine completely left worker education to a small number of cultural and educational cadres. As a result, although they were extremely busy, the results were not significant. Some mines transferred cultural and educational cadres to other work, such as serving concurrently as pit secretaries, and as secretaries of the rationalization proposal committee. As a result, they were busy with their concurrent duties and had no time to engage in worker education. In addition, in mobilizing and organizing workers to enroll, it is also necessary to carry out ideological education through organization to inspire workers to learn consciously. If the organization simply emphasizes voluntary enrollment, learning often cannot be sustained.
    Third, the teaching materials for miners' learning should be supplemented according to the conditions of the mining area. In the first half of last year, the study classes of Jixi Coal Mine did not have fixed teaching materials. Some used primary school textbooks, etc., which workers were not interested in learning. After unified use of the teaching materials compiled by the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions after September last year, these textbooks were compiled for factory workers, and some of the content was not very suitable for miners, especially underground workers. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement according to local conditions.
    Fourth, to run formalized, long-term spare-time schools, it is necessary to establish a set of step-by-step systems, such as calling the roll on time, asking for leave if you cannot attend class, regular testing, and regular upgrading. Facts have proved that students with a more complete learning system also have better results. Some spare-time schools did not adhere to a certain system, making learning cold and hot at times, and the progress was abnormal.
    Fifth, the teacher plays a major role in the success or failure of the spare-time school. The Jixi Mining Area did not pay enough attention to hiring teachers. Some teachers had a low level of education and could only read the text aloud when lecturing, and the teaching effect was not great. Part-time teachers have less time to prepare lessons, and the leaders should often conduct ideological leadership and pay attention to inspection to avoid affecting workers' learning.

　　东北鸡西煤矿区
    组织五千工人学习
    建立工人业余学校达三十一所  专设文教助理员掌管职工教育
    【本报讯】特约通讯员吕英才报道：东北鸡西煤矿区的工人教育工作已有很大发展，全矿区八个单位，现已建立职工业余学校三十一处，计一百零二班，参加学习的共五千七百二十一人，占全矿总人数（一五四七五）的百分之三十七。该区各大矿的每个采煤区，均设置了文教助理员，专门掌管职工教育。各矿机电运输工、采掘工与职员分别组织了三种不同的学习班：机电工人因一般有相当的文化基础，以技术学习为主，政治、文化为副；采掘工人因文化程度均低，以文化学习为主，政治、业务为副；职员则着重政治学习，其次为业务学习。各工人学习班统一采用东北总工会和哈尔滨市总工会所编的两种工人课本；机电工人另加制图、数学等学习材料。学习班的教员除由文教助理员担任外，多聘请当地小学教员和文化程度较高的职员、工人兼任。学习时间按工作情况而定，如工务、机电工人在早晨学习；坑口采掘工人则依其上班前后分在早、午、晚学习。
    过去一年中的学习成绩，以总机厂及各矿机电股较好。因为这些工人居住集中，而且是八小时工作制，文化基础也较好。各矿机电部门参加学习的人数达百分之七十，总机厂则达百分之八十八。总机厂的文化班（原为文盲）学员，有百分之四十一，已能写简单的条子，看工人日报；百分之三十五学会一百至二百五十字，同时学会了两位乘法；其余学员最少的也认了五十个字。坑口采掘工人参加学习的较少（占全部采掘工人的百分之十九），学习的成绩也较差，一年中由文盲学会三百字以上的约占参加学习人数的百分之二十五；大部分人认识了五十字至三百字；约有百分之二十的人还认字在五十个以下，这些多是年龄较大的工人。
    除文化程度的提高外，工人的政治觉悟与劳动热情亦随学习而提高。总机厂工人的学习成绩最好，在开展新纪录运动中也最活跃。许多工人经过学习，打破了封建、迷信、命运思想；初学掌握了国际主义思想，打破了过去因受敌伪欺骗而对苏联所存的一些错误认识。工人们提起苏联，都亲切地称为“苏联老大哥”。在斯大林七十寿辰时，各矿工人都举行了热烈的庆祝会。
    根据一年来的经验，要办好正规的工人教育，必须注意下列几个问题：
    党政工团必须密切配合  适当分配各项工作时间
    第一、矿区的党、政、工、团领导上要重视工人学习，密切配合，适当地支配各种工作的时间，否则将妨碍学习的正常进行。个别矿在这方面作得较差。如有的矿去年秋天把党、团员的文化学习和群众的文化学习分开，提出“年内消灭党内文盲”的口号，结果群众学习失去了核心，学习班因之垮了。有的矿在公开建党时，在学习时间内开会，学习班因之停课一个多月。接着新党员上党课，又影响了重新组织起来的学习班。群众很不满意。有的矿行政干部利用学习班传达工作上的事情，在上课时讲很多话，占去工人很长的学习时间，使工人感到上课学不到什么东西。影响了工人的学习情绪。
    第二、组织工人学习，要贯彻教育为生产服务的精神，要有计划地通过组织去推动。过去鸡西煤矿曾把工人教育完全让少数文教干部去作，结果他们虽然忙得一蹋糊涂，收效还是不大。有的矿则把文教干部拉去作别的工作，如兼坑口秘书、兼合理化建议委员会秘书等，结果使他们忙于所兼的职务，无暇搞工人教育工作。此外，在动员、组织工人入学上，也需要通过组织进行思想教育，启发工人自觉地学习。如果组织上单纯强调自愿上学，学习每每不能坚持。
    第三、矿山工人学习的教材，要按照矿区情况加以补充。去年上半年，鸡西煤矿各学习班没有固定的教材，有的就用小学课本等，工人学起来不感兴趣。去年九月以后统一用哈尔滨市总工会所编的教材，但这些课本是以工厂工人为对象而编的，对矿山工人，特别是井下工人，有些内容不很适合，因此需要根据当地情况加以补充。
    第四、要办好正规化的从长远打算的业余学校，要建立一套按步就班的制度，按时点名，不上课要请假，定期测验，定期升级等。事实证明，学习制度比较健全的，学员的成绩也较好。有的业余学校因未坚持一定的制度，使学习时冷时热，进行不正常。
    第五、业余学校成绩的好坏，教员起主要的作用。鸡西矿区在聘请教员方面注意不够，有的教员文化低，讲课时只能按课文往下念，教学的效果不大。兼职教员因为准备功课的时间少，领导上要经常对他们进行思想领导，注意检查，以免影响工人的学习。
