　　Further Proof of the Anglo-French Governments' War Preparations Policy
    Actually Resist the Delegation for World Peace
    People of Both Countries Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] TASS, Paris, March 14th: The Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace has issued a communique protesting the French government's refusal to allow Soviet writer and committee member, Alexander Korneychuk, to continue his stay in France. The Standing Committee pointed out: This decision by the French government proves its intention to infringe upon the activities of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace Standing Committee, an organization which is the center of powerful solidarity for hundreds of millions of peace fighters worldwide. All honest people throughout the world will regard this measure as further proof of a policy of preparing for war.
    The delegation of the France-USSR Friendship Association's Paris branch visited the Ministry of the Interior on the 13th and lodged a strong protest against both the refusal to allow Korneychuk to continue his stay in France and the ban on the sale of the Soviet magazine "New Times" in France.
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] TASS, London, March 14th: Members of the delegation from the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to England have arrived in London, where they will submit the Standing Committee's appeal to the British House of Commons. However, Soviet and Hungarian representatives, including Simonov, from the delegation were unable to come because the British government refused to issue them entry visas. British Prime Minister Attlee also notified the British Peace Committee, expressing a firm refusal to meet with the delegation. The British people are now preparing to launch a mass movement to urge the House of Commons to support the delegation.

　　法英政府备战政策又一证明
    竟抗拒和大代表团
    两国人民提出抗议
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会顷为法国政府不许该委员会委员苏联作家高涅楚克继续在法国停留一事，发表公报，表示抗议。常委会指出：法国政府这一决定，证明它意图侵害作为全世界亿万和平战士强大团结之中心的组织——世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的活动。全世界正直的人们都将认为这一措施是准备战争政策的又一证明。
    法苏友好协会巴黎分会的代表团则于十三日往访内政部，对不许高涅楚克继续在法国停留以及禁止苏联杂志新时代在法国销售两事，同时提出强硬抗议。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十四日讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会赴英代表团团员已抵伦敦，他们将向英国国会下院递交常设委员会的呼吁书。但代表团中苏联与匈牙利代表西蒙诺夫等，因英国政府拒发入境签证而未能同来。英国首相艾德礼并通知英国和平委员会，表示断然拒绝接见代表团。英国人民现正准备发动一个促使下院支持代表团的群众运动。
