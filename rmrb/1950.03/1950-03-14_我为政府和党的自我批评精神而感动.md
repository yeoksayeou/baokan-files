　　I am Moved by the Spirit of Self-Criticism of the Government and the Party
　　Li Ying

　　In the past few days, we have intimately experienced the political style of the new China and witnessed the fresh face of the new democratic society under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　From the serious waste of state assets by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the corruption and responsibility accidents on the entire Jing-Sui Railway line, the chaotic grain transportation of the Puyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the train collision in Huqiying, and even the remnants of the feudal marriage system in the old liberated areas, all these illustrate the malfeasance of bureaucracy. However, the Party and the Central Government never conceal it, let alone avoid treatment for fear of disease. The People's Daily has published editorials in recent days criticizing bureaucracy for causing significant losses to the country and the people. It calls on working cadres to improve their awareness and discipline. What is particularly gratifying here is that it is full of the spirit of self-examination, especially for the Party member cadres who are responsible for the above-mentioned incidents, and they are given strict education and criticism. For example, when criticizing the "hard-working bureaucracy" of the manager and military representative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, it said: "This kind of bureaucracy is not unwilling to work, but is working very hard; it is not idle, but busy; it is not pursuing personal enjoyment, but is struggling hard." But spending all day "busy" and "hard-working" falls into the "abyss of pragmatism," becoming detached from "practical work and the lives of the masses." The former North China Enterprise Department and China Steel Company made the same mistake without prior policy instructions. In the Puyang grain transportation incident, the editorial emphasized that it was the Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the local CCP Prefectural Committee that neglected the state's finances and the people's lives, lacked a mass perspective, did not have kind concern for the working people, and lacked a spirit of self-criticism, resulting from "lack of training." In the handling of the major inspection of the Jing-Sui Railway line and the Huqiying incident, it was particularly emphasized that the repeated mistakes of the retained personnel were due to insufficient leadership from the Party and administrative sides, which should be examined. In the editorial "Correctly Solving the Marriage System Problem," it reminded to "conduct education against the feudal marriage system among rural areas, especially rural cadres and Party members."

　　What do these all illustrate? The Party and the government are responsible for every bit of the people's affairs, and Party member cadres who make mistakes must be punished first. Isn't the case of Lin Zi'an, the director of the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau shortly after liberation, still fresh in the minds of the people?

　　Following these events, the Central Government announced the nationwide vehicle inventory and the document on unified financial and economic institutions. The construction of the new China is no longer a "distant vision." The Party and the Central Government are so responsible to the people and full of such a spirit of self-criticism and self-blame. We cannot leave such a Party and such a government at any time. Let us work even harder to welcome a life of freedom, peace, happiness, and well-being. I also hope that comrades who have been criticized by the newspaper and have made mistakes will also openly examine and correct their mistakes with a happy mood so that they can do more work for the people's cause.

　　我为政府和党的自我批评精神而感动
    李婴
    几天来我们亲切的体验了新中国的政风，也看见新民主主义社会在中国共产党领导下的新鲜的面目。
    由石景山钢铁厂严重浪费国家资财，京绥全线贪污与责任事故，濮阳专署运粮的混乱现象，花旗营的撞车事件，连老区残存的封建婚姻制度，这些都说明着官僚主义在作祟，但党和中央，绝不掩饰，更不讳疾忌医。人民日报针对上面的问题，连日发表社论痛斥官僚主义造成国家人民的重大损失。并号召工作干部提高觉悟性和纪律性，这里面特别值得令人欣慰的，是充满了自我检讨的精神，尤其对上述事件发生负责领导的党员干部，更予以严格的教育和批评，如指责石钢厂经理和军代表的“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义”时说：“这种官僚主义，不是不肯工作，而是很努力工作，不是闲，而是忙，不是追求个人享受，而是在刻苦奋斗。”但终日“忙忙碌碌”，“辛辛苦苦”就陷入“事务主义的深渊”。就跟“实际工作，和群众生活”脱离。前华北企业部和华钢公司，事先没有方针指示也同样犯了这种错误，濮阳运粮事件中，社论更着重提出那是专署和该地中共地委忽视了国家财政和人民的生活，缺乏群众观点，对劳动人民不亲切关怀，没有自我批评精神，“缺少锻炼”所致。在京绥全线大检查和花旗营事件的处理中，特别着重地指出，留用人员的迭犯错误，是党和行政方面领导的不够，应该检讨。在“正确解决婚姻制度问题”的社论中，提醒要“在农村中特别是农村干部与党员中进行反对封建婚姻制度的教育。”
    这些都说明什么呢？党和政府对人民一点一滴都要负责的，党员干部犯了错误，要首先受到责罚。解放不久张家口铁路局长蔺子安事件，不是还新鲜地记在老百姓的脑子里吗？
    紧接着这几天中央公布了全国车辆大清查，和统一财政经济机构的文件，新中国的建设已非“远景”。党和中央对人民这样的负责，充满这样自我批评和责己的精神，我们时时刻刻不能离开这样的党，这样的政府。让我们更加紧工作，来迎接自由、和平、幸福、康乐的生活。我也希望为报纸所批评了的犯有错误的同志也同样以愉快的心情公开检讨并改正自己的错误，以便更好地为人民事业而作更多的工作。
