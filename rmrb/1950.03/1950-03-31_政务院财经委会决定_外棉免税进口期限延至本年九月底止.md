    Extension of Tax-Exempt Import Period for Foreign Cotton to the End of September This Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 30th] The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council has decided to extend the effective period of the tax-exempt import regulations for foreign cotton. Previously, in order to ensure the supply of cotton for textile use throughout the country and encourage public and private manufacturers to organize the import of foreign cotton, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council stipulated that from January 1st to the end of March this year, all foreign cotton imported by public and private manufacturers through the ports within the customs area would be exempt from import tax. Now that the term of this tax-exemption regulation has expired, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has decided to extend the aforementioned tax-exempt import regulation for foreign cotton to remain effective until the end of September this year, in order to encourage public and private manufacturers to continue organizing the import of foreign cotton.
