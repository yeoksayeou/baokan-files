　　Chahar Daily Publishes Short Commentary
    Calling on People's Representatives from All Walks of Life to Supervise Administrative Staff
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chahar Daily published a short commentary on March 13th stating: At the second People's Representatives Conference of Yanggao County, thirteen county and district cadres, including Sun Shan, the CCP District Secretary of the Second District, who were dedicated to their duties and worked diligently, were commended; Sun Pei, the district chief who neglected his duties, was punished. This is an example of the People's Representatives Conference of the county supervising administrative staff and earnestly implementing policies and decrees.
    Why was Sun Pei punished? First, as the district chief of the People's Government, he should not have violated the forest protection policy. Second, his style was too bad, beating the masses, beating village cadres, and beating people's representatives. What a terrible style this is! Third, after the incident occurred, he did not honestly conduct self-criticism, but instead distorted the facts to deceive his superiors, attempting to shirk responsibility. The above-mentioned serious acts of anarchism and indiscipline are absolutely not allowed by the People's Government. Therefore, it is very correct for the people's representatives to criticize and accuse him, and for the government to decide to remove him from his post.
    The higher-level government has repeatedly emphasized the protection of forests and the opposition to coercive commandism, and the newspapers have repeatedly criticized the phenomenon of forest destruction. Why did Comrade Sun Pei, the district chief who was implementing the policies of the People's Government, commit the serious act of destroying forests and beating the masses? Did he not know the government's policies? There is no other reason to explain this except that he was completely irresponsible for the interests of the people and had no regard for the law. The timber needed by the 209th Division's production unit should be purchased with money and should not be demanded from the district. The district government has the right to refuse this unreasonable request; because the responsibility of governments at all levels is to implement government policies and decrees, and they must be very serious in the face of the laws and disciplines of the People's Government, and have the determination and perseverance to fight against any destructive phenomena. Comrade Sun Pei's mistake lies in abandoning his sacred duties, causing serious losses. This should be a lesson for all administrative personnel.
    The powers of the people's representatives, in addition to explaining and conveying the resolutions of the representative conference to the people and assisting the government in implementing the resolutions, are also to represent the people in supervising government staff, so that they earnestly implement all government policies and decrees. If any cadres are found to have illegal acts, dereliction of duty, bureaucracy, coercive commandism, etc., the representatives have the right and responsibility to raise criticisms at the representative conference, and even suggest that the government give them the punishment they deserve. By doing so, government staff can implement government policies and decrees under the direct supervision of the people. All bad styles and bad phenomena that deviate from the people and violate policies will be quickly exposed and effectively corrected. Supervising administrative personnel through people's representatives is an effective way for the People's Government to overcome bureaucracy and closely connect with the masses. All localities should consciously promote the practices of the Yanggao People's Representatives Conference. At the same time, this kind of supervision should not only be raised at the representative conference, but also be promptly reflected to the government during the adjournment.

### 察哈尔日报发表短评  号召各界人民代表  监督行政工作人员

　　察哈尔日报发表短评
    号召各界人民代表  监督行政工作人员
    【本报讯】察哈尔日报于三月十三日发表短评称：阳高县二次各界人民代表会议上，奖励了埋头苦干忠于职守的二区中共区书孙善等县区干部十三人；处分了失职区长孙培。这是县各界人民代表会议监督行政工作人员，切实执行政策法令的例证。
    为什么处分孙培呢？第一、他身为人民政府的区长，不该破坏护林政策。第二、他的作风太坏，打群众、打村干部、打人民代表，这是多么恶劣的作风啊！第三、事情发生了，他不老老实实地进行自我检讨，反而歪曲事实欺骗上级，企图推脱责任。以上严重的无政府无纪律的行为，是人民政府绝对不允许的，因此人民代表们对他加以批评指责，政府决定给予撤职处分就是非常正确的。
    上级政府对保护林木，反对强迫命令作风都曾三令五申，报纸也一再批评破坏林木现象，而身为执行人民政府政策的区长孙培同志，为什么竟然发生破坏林木殴打群众的严重行为呢？难道他不知道政府的政策吗？这除了他对人民利益毫不负责，目无法纪以外，是没有别的理由可以解释的。二○九师生产所需要的木料，是应该拿钱购买的，不应该向区里去要。区政府有权拒绝这种无理要求；因为各级政府的责任是执行政府的政策法令，在人民政府法纪面前必须是十分严肃的，要有与任何破坏现象斗争的决心与毅力。孙培同志的错误，就在于放弃了自己神圣的职责，造成严重损失，这应成为所有行政人员的教训。
    人民代表的职权，除了向人民解释传达代表会的决议，协助政府贯彻决议外，就是要代表人民监督政府工作人员，使其切实执行政府的一切政策法令。凡发现干部有违法失职、官僚主义、强迫命令等行为者，代表们就有权利有责任在代表会议上提出批评，以至建议政府给以应有的处分。这样做，就可以使政府工作人员，在人民的直接监督下，执行政府的政策法令。一切脱离人民违犯政策的坏作风、坏现象，便会得到迅速地揭发和有效的纠正。通过人民代表监督行政人员，这是人民政府克服官僚主义密切与群众联系的有效办法。各地应有意识地推广阳高各界代表会议的作法。同时这种监督，不仅应在代表会上提出，而且应该在闭会期间及时向政府反映。
