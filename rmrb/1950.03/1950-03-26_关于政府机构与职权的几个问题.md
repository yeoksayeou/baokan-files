Several Questions Regarding Government Agencies and Powers

(1) Question: Can the People's Supervisory Committee supervise higher-level and same-level agencies?

Answer: Article 19 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "People's supervisory organs shall be established in people's governments at and above the county and city levels to supervise whether state organs at all levels and various public officials are performing their duties, and to correct illegal and derelict organs and personnel among them. The people and people's organizations have the right to accuse any state organ and any public official of dereliction of duty to the People's Supervisory organs or the People's judicial organs.” Therefore, the staff of the Government Administration Council and public officials of the same level are no exception. As for the methods and procedures for the Supervisory Committee to conduct supervision on these agencies and public officials, separate regulations will be formulated. In addition, Article 28 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government stipulates: "The Supreme People's Procuratorate shall bear the highest procuratorial responsibility for the strict observance of laws by government agencies, public officials, and the national people." This will play a role in ensuring the work of the People's Supervisory Committee.

(2) Question: The Ministry of Justice and the Legislative Affairs Commission are both under the Government Administration Council. Are the legislative, judicial, and administrative powers not separated?

Answer: The doctrine of the separation of legislative, judicial, and administrative powers is a traditional theory of capitalist countries. It is nominally "separation," but in reality, it is manipulated by the big bourgeoisie in order to rule the people. The People's Government does not adopt this hypocritical form. According to Article 12 of the Common Program: "The supreme organ of state power is the National People's Congress. During the adjournment of the National People's Congress, the Central People's Government is the highest organ for exercising state power." This shows that the power of a people's democratic state cannot be mechanically divided and separated into legislative, judicial, and administrative powers. However, this is not weakening democracy but is effectively guaranteeing democracy. Because the National People's Congress, the highest organ of state power, like other people's congresses at all levels, is also produced by the people through universal suffrage.

The Government Administration Council, according to Article 5 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, is the "highest executive organ of state administration" under the leadership of the Central People's Government. The Ministry of Justice and the Legislative Affairs Commission, like other ministries and commissions of the same nature, are executive organs under the leadership of the Government Administration Council. The division of responsibilities between the Ministry of Justice and the Legislative Affairs Commission will be specifically stipulated in the organizational regulations of the respective ministries and commissions.

(3) Question: Does the Supreme People's Court have a system at each level? What is the difference in its powers from the Ministry of Justice?

Answer: According to Article 26 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government: "The Supreme People's Court is the highest judicial organ in the country and is responsible for leading and supervising the judicial work of people's courts at all levels." This shows that the functions and powers of the Supreme People's Court are to handle, lead, and supervise judicial work. As for judicial administrative work, it shall be presided over by the Ministry of Justice in accordance with Article 18 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government. The specific differences in functions and powers will be stipulated in the organizational regulations of the respective courts and ministries.

(4) Question: Article 4 of the Common Program stipulates that the people have the right to vote and to be elected according to law. Do they have the right to recall?

Answer: According to Articles 12 and 13 of the Common Program: "People's congresses at all levels shall elect people's governments at all levels," and "Before the convening of the National People's Congress elected by universal suffrage, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference shall exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress." Furthermore, according to Article 5 of the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "If a participating unit or representative or member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference violates the Organic Law, the Common Program, or major resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the circumstances are serious, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference or the National Committee may, depending on the severity of the circumstances, give warnings, replace representatives, revoke the qualifications of members, or revoke the participation of units.” Based on the above provisions, and referring to the actual situation of people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences held in urban and rural areas across the country, it is clear that the people not only have the right to elect or be elected into people's government committees at all levels, but also have the right to replace representatives, revoke the qualifications of members, or revoke the participation of units through people's political power organs at all levels.

As for the people's governments at all levels that exercise people's political power at all levels, they certainly have the right not only to appoint public officials, but also to remove public officials.

Therefore, the "right of recall" exercised indirectly by the people through the people's political power organs does not need to be listed in parallel with the people's universal and directly exercised right to vote and to be elected.

(5) Question: What is the difference between the People's Public Security Forces and the People's Police? Why was the police station changed to the Public Security Bureau?

Answer: The past police stations (which were also called public security bureaus) and the police were used by the reactionary ruling class to suppress the people. The current public security forces, public security bureaus, and police are used by the people to serve themselves. We have public security forces and people's police. The former is under the command of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission (but the People's Government's public security departments may be authorized to command them); the latter is under the command of the People's Government's public security departments.

The reason for changing the police station to the Public Security Bureau is that the people in the liberated areas have always called their organs that maintain social order and stability the public security departments. As for "police," because it is more familiar to the urban people, it is still used, but it is prefixed with the word "People's" to distinguish it from the police who served the reactionary ruling class in the past.

### 关于政府机构与职权的几个问题

专栏：询问与答复

　　关于政府机构与职权的几个问题
    （一）问：人民监察委员会能否监察上级及同级机关？
    答：中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十九条规定：“在县市以上的各级人民政府内，设人民监察机关，以监督各级国家机关和各种公务人员是否履行其职责，并纠举其中之违法失职的机关和职员。人民和人民团体有权向人民监察机关或人民司法机关控告任何国家机关和任何公务人员的失职行为。”那末，政务院工作人员及其同级公务人员自属不能例外。至监委会对此等机关及公务人员进行监察工作的方式及程序问题，当另行规定。此外，中央人民政府组织法第二十八条规定：“最高人民检察署对政府机关、公务人员和全国国民之严守法律，负最高的检察责任。”这对于人民监察工作，是会起保证作用的。
    （二）问：司法部和法制委员会同隶属于政务院，立法、司法、行政是否三权不分？
    答：立法、司法、行政三权鼎立的学说，是资本主义国家的传统理论，名为“鼎立”，实际皆由大资产阶级一手操纵，以便统治人民。这种虚伪的形式是人民政府所不采取的。依共同纲领第十二条规定：“国家最高政权机关为全国人民代表大会。全国人民代表大会闭会期间，中央人民政府为行使国家政权的最高机关。”这就表明：人民民主国家政权是不能按立法、司法、行政机械地割裂并鼎立起来的。但这决不是减弱民主而正是有效地保证了民主。因为全国最高政权机关的全国人民代表大会，和其他各级人民代表大会一样，也是由人民用普选方法产生的。
    政务院，依中央人民政府组织法第五条规定，是在中央人民政府领导下的“国家政务的最高执行机关”，而司法部和法制委员会，和其他同性质的部会一样，又是在政务院领导下的执行机关。至于司法部和法委会的职责的划分，当分别在该部、会的组织条例中具体规定。
    （三）问：最高法院是否有其逐级系统？与司法部在职权上有何区别？
    答：依中央人民政府组织法第二十六条规定：“最高人民法院为全国最高审判机关，并负责领导和监督全国各级审判机关的审判工作。”这说明最高人民法院的职权是处理、领导及监督审判工作。至于司法行政工作，则应依中央人民政府组织法第十八条规定，由司法部主持。职权具体区别，将于各该院、部的组织条例内规定。
    （四）问：共同纲领第四条规定人民依法有选举权与被选举权，是否有罢免权？
    答：依共同纲领第十二，十三两条规定：“各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府”，“在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以前，由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行全国人民代表大会的职权。”又依中国人民政治协商会议组织法第五条规定：“中国人民政协的参加单位或代表或全国委员会委员，如有违反人民政协的组织法、共同纲领或主要决议而情节严重者，得由中国人民政协全体会议或全国委员会视其情节严重的程度，分别予以警告、撤换代表、撤销委员资格或撤销参加单位等处分。”本以上规定，并参照目前在全国城乡所举行的各界代表会、农民代表会的实际情形，可以明了：人民不仅有权选举或被选入各级人民政府委员会，并且经过各级人民政权机关还有权撤换代表、撤销委员或撤销参加单位。
    至于行使各级人民政权的各级人民政府，当然不仅有权任用公务人员，也有权撤换公务人员。
    因此，人民经由人民政权机关而间接行使的“罢免权”，无须和人民普遍的、直接行使的选举权与被选举权并列出来。
    （五）问：人民公安部队与人民警察有什么不同？为什么警察局改为公安局？
    答：过去的警察局（也曾叫过公安局）和警察，是反动统治阶级用来镇压人民的。现在的公安部队，公安局和警察，是人民用来给自己服务的。我们有公安部队，也有人民警察。前者受中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会统率（但人民政府公安部门得受权指挥）；后者受人民政府公安部门统率。
    改警察局为公安局，是因为解放区人民向来称自己维持社会安宁秩序的机关为公安部门。至于“警察”，因为对城市人民比较习惯，所以也还沿用，不过上冠“人民”二字，以区别于过去为反动统治阶级服务的警察。
