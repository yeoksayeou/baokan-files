Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th: To improve the production efficiency of railway factories and formulate implementation measures for the enterprise management of railway factories, as well as necessary technical standards, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened a national railway factory affairs meeting in Beijing from the 6th to the 11th. More than 140 people attended the meeting, including factory directors, deputy factory directors, experts, engineers, labor heroes from railway factories across the country, and representatives from various units of the Ministry of Railways. The meeting discussed the work tasks for 1950, initially formulated the implementation measures for enterprise management of railway factories, accounting subjects, temporary detailed rules for the classification of machine, passenger, and freight car overhaul procedures, temporary measures for the management, use, and overhaul regulations of mechanical equipment, and decided to gradually move towards enterprise-oriented management methods. At the meeting, Li Menghou, Director of the Factory Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, gave a work summary report for 1949. He pointed out that the factory affairs work in 1949 did not complete its tasks. Among them, locomotive repair and manufacturing only reached 77% of production capacity, passenger car overhaul reached 80.5%, and freight car overhaul reached 78%. This was due to the serious bureaucratic style of the leading organs. Although work plans were made, there was little inspection, and the on-site situation was not well grasped, resulting in the failure of each factory's production capacity to be fully utilized. Shi Zhiren, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, called on everyone in his speech to unify technical standards, and all engineers and technicians should learn from Soviet experts and workers. Before the meeting concluded, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways, gave a report to the conference. He pointed out that the most important task at present is to repair locomotives and vehicles. The leaders of each factory should carefully register and inventory existing materials and spare parts to solve the current difficulties in repairing vehicle materials. Regarding the failure of most factories to complete their production tasks, Minister Teng requested the leaders of each factory to conduct in-depth self-criticism and establish a strict inspection system in the future, and to publicly criticize or even impose appropriate punishments on those who are derelict in their duties. He also proposed to pay attention to improving and upgrading technology. Finally, he called on all factories to move towards enterprise management and implement a strict economic accounting system to achieve the goals of reducing costs and improving production efficiency.

　　提高铁路工厂生产效率
    铁道部召开铁路厂务会议
    制定办法迈向企业化
    【新华社北京十三日电】中央人民政府铁道部为提高铁路工厂的生产效率，制定铁路工厂企业化施行办法及必要的技术标准，特于六日至十一日在北京召开全国铁路厂务会议。参加会议的有全国各铁路工厂厂长、副厂长、专家、工程师、劳动英雄及铁道部各单位的代表共一百四十余人。会议讨论了一九五○年的工作任务，初步制定了铁路工厂企业化施行办法、会计科目、机客货车检修修程分等暂行细则、机械设备管理使用及检修规程暂行办法，并决定了有步骤地走向企业化的经营方式。会上铁道部厂务局长李梦吼作了一九四九年工作总结报告。他指出，一九四九年厂务工作没有完成任务，其中机车修造只达成生产能力的百分之七十七，客车检修达成百分之八十·五，货车检修达成百分之七十八。这是由于领导机关存在着严重的官僚主义作风，工作虽作了计划，但很少检查，同时也没有很好地掌握现场情况，以致使各厂生产能力未能充分发挥。铁道部副部长石志仁在讲话中号召大家做到统一技术标准，所有的工程师和技术员应向苏联专家学习，向工人学习。会议结束前，铁道部部长滕代远向大会作了报告。他指出：当前最重要的工作是修理机车和车辆。各厂领导人员应详细登记清点现有的材料备品，以解决目前修车材料的困难。对于大部分工厂未能完成生产任务一事，滕部长要求各工厂的领导人员深刻检讨，并应在今后建立严格的检查制度，对失职者进行公开批评以至应得的处分。他并提出要注意改进和提高技术。最后他号召各工厂要向企业化迈进，实行严格的经济核算制，以达到减低成本，提高生产效率的目的。
