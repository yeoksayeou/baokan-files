Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th: The Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, reported on the 11th that Vietnamese Foreign Minister Hoang Minh Giam, in a statement to the press regarding the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, stated: The Sino-Soviet Treaty is the concrete crystallization of the genuine friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China. The Soviet Union's assistance to the new China is in stark contrast to the so-called "aid agreements" concluded between capitalist countries within the framework of the Marshall Plan. The agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Dalian, and Lushun clearly demonstrates the Soviet Union's respect for China's national sovereignty and the spirit of friendly cooperation between the two countries based on equality.

Hoang Minh Giam pointed out that the Sino-Soviet Treaty will effectively help the Chinese people build a prosperous and strong democratic new China at an early date. This proves that the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union can completely develop its economy with its own strength without relying on imperialist countries. At the same time, the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty marks a decisive step in safeguarding peace and security in the Far East. The alliance of these two brotherly countries unites nearly 700 million people across vast territories from Europe to Asia, forming a powerful fortress against the expansionism of the imperialists.

　　越外长赞扬中苏条约
    这条约的缔结是保卫远东和平与安全的决定性步骤的标志
    【新华社北京十四日电】越南通讯社北越十一日讯：越南外交部长黄明鉴顷就中苏友好同盟互助条约对报界发表谈话称：中苏条约为苏中两国人民间真正友谊的具体结晶。苏联给新中国的援助，与资本主义国家间在马歇尔计划范围内缔结的所谓“援助协定”，是一个尖锐的对比。关于中国长春铁路、大连和旅顺口的协定，明白地显示出苏联对中国在国家主权的尊重和两国间基于平等的友好合作精神。
    黄氏指出：中苏条约将有效地帮助中国人民早日建设富强的民主的新中国。这证明苏联领导的民主阵营能够完全不依靠帝国主义国家，而用他们自己的力量来发展其经济。同时，中苏条约的缔结，乃是保卫远东和平与安全的决定性步骤的标志。这两兄弟国家的同盟，团结了从欧洲到亚洲的广大领土上将近七亿的人民，形成反对帝国主义者的扩张主义的强大堡垒。
