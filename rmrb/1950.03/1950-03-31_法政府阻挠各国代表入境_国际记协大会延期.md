　　French Government Obstructs Entry of Delegates from Various Countries
    International Association of Journalists Congress Postponed
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 30th] The Third Congress of the International Association of Journalists, originally scheduled to be held in Paris on March 27th, has been postponed due to the unreasonable obstruction by the French government.

    According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on March 29th, citing a report from Paris by Pravda reporter Zhukov: Because the French authorities refused to issue an entry visa to Mr. Hronek, the Secretary-General of the International Organization of Journalists and a journalist from Czechoslovakia, and even felt it unnecessary to respond to journalists from Poland and Romania and some other countries who applied for entry visas, the French Journalists' Union had to raise this issue at the Executive Committee of the International Association of Journalists, namely, that the congress must be postponed so that it can be held in another country in the future. The French Journalists' Union also held a press conference for this purpose on the 28th. Mr. Hermann, the Secretary-General of the union, announced at the meeting that due to the impolite interference of the French authorities, the International Association of Journalists Congress could not be held in Paris, and French journalists were deeply indignant at this behavior of the French government. Mr. Florrier, a member of the Standing Committee of the French Journalists' Union, pointed out at the press conference that the International Association of Journalists participated in the movement to defend peace and was prepared to participate actively. This situation made all those who attempted to use newspapers as weapons for war preparation uneasy. Florrier declared that protests against the French authorities' rude actions in prohibiting the convening of the journalists' congress in Paris were constantly being sent from various countries. The journalists who attended the press conference unanimously signed and issued a protest against the French government's undemocratic measures.

　　法政府阻挠各国代表入境
    国际记协大会延期
    【新华社三十日讯】原定于三月二十七日在巴黎召开的国际记者协会第三次代表大会，由于法国政府的无理阻挠，已决定延期。
    据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电引真理报记者朱可夫巴黎通讯称：由于法国当局拒发入境签证给国际新闻记者协会秘书长、捷克斯洛伐克新闻记者赫朗尼克，而且，甚至还认为不必答复保、罗新闻记者及申请发给入境签证的其他某些国家的新闻记者，因此，法国新闻记者工会便不得不在国际记协执行委员会上提出这一问题，即必须延期举行代表大会，俾使代表大会将来能在其他国家举行。法国新闻记者工会并为此于二十八日举行了记者招待会。该工会秘书长赫尔曼在会上宣布：由于法国当局的无礼干涉，国际新闻记者代表大会已不能在巴黎举行，法国记者对法国政府的此种行为，深感愤慨。法国新闻记者工会常务委员佛黎叶在记者招待会上指出：国际记协参加了拥护和平的运动，并且还准备积极地参加。这种情形就使所有企图利用报纸作为备战武器的人坐卧不安。佛黎叶宣称，反对法国当局禁止在巴黎召开新闻工作者代表大会的无礼举动的抗议，正由各国不断发来。参加记者招待会的记者们一致签名发出反对法国政府采取此种反民主措施的抗议书。
