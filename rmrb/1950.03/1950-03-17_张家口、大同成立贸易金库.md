Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 16th—In order to implement the Central People's Government's decision to unify national financial and economic work, trade treasuries in Zhangjiakou and Datong cities, Chahar Province, were established on the 10th and 12th respectively. Starting from the 10th, cash from various specialized companies in Zhangjiakou has begun to be deposited into the treasury. On the 9th of this month, Sha Qianli, Vice Minister of Trade of the Central People's Government, convened a meeting in Zhangjiakou with over 40 leading cadres, including the heads of the Commercial Bureaus of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces and the managers of various state-owned trading companies, to discuss the establishment of the treasuries. It was decided that branch treasuries would be established in Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Gui Sui cities in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, directly under the leadership of the Central General Treasury. Starting from the 11th, 12th, and 15th, respectively, the various state-owned trading companies in Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Gui Sui must deposit the cash from daily sales into the treasury on a daily basis. Companies in Zhangjiakou should start clearing their existing cash on the 10th and deposit it into the treasury on the 11th. Starting on the 12th, the Zhangjiakou treasury will begin implementing the system of reporting to the Central Government daily. The various trade branches or trade work groups in the Chahar South, Chahar North, and Yanbei special districts must also deposit the cash from daily sales into local banks for safekeeping and report it to the branch treasury; in areas without banks, it should be transferred to the branch treasury every three to five days. As for the working capital and expenses required by the various specialized companies, plans must be drawn up daily and cash will be allocated separately after approval by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. The business plans for the various state-owned trading companies for March will also be re-examined and revised, and implemented after approval by the respective specialized general companies.
