On the Nationalization of British Industry
By Gede Na, translated by Lin Hai

One constantly hears British Labour Party propagandists saying, "We workers are now the ruling class," and boasting that most of British industry has been "socialized," wanting to use this as proof. One also hears more "socialization" from the Conservatives, who attempt to confuse all kinds of enterprise controls and attack them indiscriminately. And, regardless of all past experience, they also want the term "socialization" to frighten the people.

The fact is that monopoly capitalism has already given industry a highly developed social form of production, and the Labour government has nationalized some monopolies and is in the process of nationalizing the steel industry.

However, it is deceptive to say that these nationalized industries are socialist industries. Socialization will bring about a completely new production relationship in land or industrial production. But the workers employed in the nationalized industries have not changed their status.

In the Communist Party's election manifesto, "The British Road to Socialism," it is clearly stated: "Operating these industries is only for the purpose of giving profits to their former owners." Indeed, under state protection, guaranteeing that the former owners can obtain profits is the first thing these industries have to pay, while the exploitation of workers continues as before.

The talk of a so-called mixed economy is used to cultivate the illusion that Britain can gradually transition from capitalism to socialism.

The increase in productivity is for the purpose of conducting trade wars at home and abroad, which does not bring any long-term benefits to the British people. Production efficiency is important for prosperity, but prosperity can only be guaranteed if this efficiency is coordinated with social needs and the planned distribution of industrial products.

Limited nationalization plans, as proposed by the Labour Party, may reduce the scope of monopolies, but do not harm the power of monopolies and cannot bring about any fundamental changes in the British economy.

The Communist Party's proposal to immediately nationalize Britain's basic industries would be a real challenge to the power of monopoly capitalism.

Simultaneously nationalizing nautical engineering, shipbuilding, ship repair, and shipping industries would enable the adjustment of the planned development of all nautical industries.

Nationalizing the main sectors of the engineering industry to produce and supply modern equipment to mines, railways, power generation, gas construction, and food production would promote the planned development of these industries.

Applying the same principle to the textile industry and other industries, then achieving a comprehensive plan for a prosperous Britain would no longer need to be discussed abstractly, but could become a plan that is immediately put into practice.

In short, the most important thing is that nationalization should have a new meaning, so that it is actually socialization. Make all workers feel interested in how to make industry fully efficient and highly productive. This means that the management of industry will be something that technicians and workers are equally interested in. Development plans will be a concern for everyone in the industry. Technicians and workers, through their trade unions, fully participate in development plans.

Putting such a plan into practice immediately is a serious and urgent task for the British people. For a country like Britain that relies on imported food to supply its people and imported raw materials to supply its industry, it is utterly foolish to hand over our destiny to private monopoly capital.

In the capitalist trade situation, Jia Yi's warning that the dollar crisis may accompany us for the rest of our lives is not an exaggeration. But Jia Yi forgot that there is a way out of the British crisis—the road to socialism, which can only be found when the socialization of industry is put into practice.

Establishing our own socialized industry will make us truly interested in production efficiency. It will also make us interested in the socialized industries of other countries, making us friendly with the Soviet Union and other countries that practice socialist economies.

Relying on imports from the dollar area will become a thing of the past, and the balance of the dollar will not need to become a long-term problem, as Jia Yi described. The British crisis can be solved by applying socialist principles, and the prospect of raising the living standards of the British working people can be foreseen soon.

　　论英国产业国有化
    格德纳作  林海译
    人们老是听到英国工党的宣传家说什么“我们工人现在是统治阶级了”，还吹嘘着说英国大部分工业已经“社会主义化”了，想以此为证。人们亦从保守党处听到更多的“社会主义化”，他们这些人企图把各种企业控制都混淆起来，一律予以攻袭。并且，不管过去一切经验，他们还想“社会主义化”这个名辞，会把老百姓吓倒。
    事实是，垄断资本主义已给工业以生产的高度发展的社会形式，而工党政府则对某些垄断资本收归国有，对于钢铁工业亦正在进行国有化中。
    但是，如果说这些国有化的工业就是社会主义化的工业，那是骗人的。社会主义化将使土地上或者工业上的生产有一种完全新的生产关系。可是雇用在国有化工业中的工人并没有改变他们的地位。
    在共产党的竞选宣言“英国的社会主义道路”上，明白地说道：“经营这些工业只是为了给它们从前的主人们以利润。”实在地，在国家保护之下，保证那些从前的业主可以获得利润，这是那些工业首先要付出的，而对工人的剥削却还是和从前一样地继续着。
    所谓混合经济的奇谈，是用来培植英国可以从资本主义逐渐过渡到社会主义的这种幻想。
    生产力之增加为着在国内外进行贸易战争，这对英国人民并没有带来什么长远的利益。生产效率对繁荣是重要的，但只有这种效率是配合着社会的需要以及工业产品的有计划的分配，繁荣才能有保障。
    有限度的国有化计划，如工党所建议者，虽然也许会削减垄断的范围，但并不损及垄断的力量，对英国经济也不能引起什么根本变化。
    共产党建议的立即将英国基本工业收归国有，却将是对垄断资本主义的力量的一个真正的挑战。
    同时将航海工程、造船、修船和航运业收归国有，将可能调整所有航海工业的有计划的发展。
    工程工业之主要部门收归国有，以生产及供给近代新式设备给矿山、铁路、发电、煤气建筑业和粮食生产，这就会促进这些工业的有计划发展。
    应用同一原则于纺织业和其他工业，那末达到一个繁荣英国的全面计划，便不再需要抽象地去谈论它，而是可以变成一个即刻付诸实施的计划了。
    总之，最重要的，是国有化应具有一种新的意义，使它实际上是社会主义化。使所有工人，对于如何使工业有充分的效率和高度的生产力，自己感到兴趣。这意味着，工业的管理，将是技师和工人同样感到兴趣的事情。发展的计划，将为工业中每个人所关心。技师和工人，通过他们的工会，充分参加发展计划。
    使这样一个计划立即付诸实施，是英国人民的一个严重的紧急任务。倚赖输入的粮食以供给人民，输入的原料以供给工业如英国者，把我们的命运交给私人垄断资本，那是全然愚蠢的。
    在资本主义的贸易情况中，贾伊警告说美元危机可能将伴随我们一辈子，这并不是夸张的。但贾伊忘记了英国危机有一条出路——社会主义的道路，只有工业社会主义化付诸实行才能够找到出路。
    建立我们自己的社会主义化工业，将使我们对生产效率有真正的兴趣。它还将使我们对其他国家的社会主义化工业感到兴趣，使我们和苏联以及其他实行社会主义经济的国家友好。
    倚赖美元地区进口将成过去，美元的平衡，便用不着成为长期的问题，如贾伊所描写那样。英国的危机可以应用社会主义原则来予解决，并且可以预见不久英国劳动人民提高生活水准的前景。（译自《英国工人日报》）
