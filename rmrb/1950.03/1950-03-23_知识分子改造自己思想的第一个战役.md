　　The First Battle for Intellectuals to Remold Their Ideology
　　·Peng Qingzhao·
    Intellectuals rely on the masses and the organization to remold their ideology; however, the main thing is to rely on themselves. They must lay out their thoughts and history before the masses, and take the lead in conducting systematic self-criticism. Doing it this way, old ideological consciousness will definitely resist, and will have to go through a rather fierce inner struggle. Therefore, some pain is unavoidable, but in the end it will make you feel the pleasure of having taken a bath.

    Many comrades, when they first began to use the weapon of theory to remold themselves, simply took documents discussing ideological issues (such as Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism") and compared them simply with themselves, saying: "I have this problem. I don't have this problem. I have a little bit of this one..." just like elementary school students adding plus and minus signs on a test paper. As for how serious the problems they said they had were, to what extent they violated the interests of the people, how much they harmed themselves, where they came from, and how to work hard to correct them in the future, they didn't think about any of that. As for the problems they said they didn't have, they didn't even think about them.

    A step further than this is to reflect carefully according to the document, listing specific facts, and digging out certain problems discussed in the document from one's own thinking. But they still couldn't figure out how many other problems they had, couldn't systematically understand themselves, and couldn't find a clue about the direction of future efforts. At this time, because they were beginning to "see through" themselves, they were generally unable to be calm and objective, and many comrades often had a feeling of "collapse" at this stage. Later, with the mutual inspiration and help of comrades, new perspectives were gradually established, and they gradually overcame this difficulty.

    Following the above step, some comrades went further and put down the documents and books, picked up the basic viewpoints they had learned, and made a major reckoning of their own thinking from a historical perspective. This applies the basic viewpoints learned from books to the analysis of one's own ideological reality, making it gradually concrete, overturning one's original set of standards for judging right and wrong, good and evil, and establishing new standards.

    In this kind of major reckoning, for those who feel their history is "radiant," it's better to start by reckoning with their own history. In the past struggles of the people against imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, did you decorate the old society as a "moralist," "entrepreneur," "philanthropist," or a free and unrestrained "literary figure"? Or did you really stand on the side of the people and oppose the old society? If you also opposed the old society, what was the motive? How much testing did you undergo? How much of a place did your achievements occupy in the entire people's struggle? Asking yourself these questions can peel off the brilliance that confuses you from your history, and make you step from the clouds to the ground.

    There is another type of person who has another kind of burden in their thinking, which needs to be cleared up first, namely, conceit about good qualities: such as "justice," "enthusiasm," "unyielding spirit," and so on. Many of these people have a bellyful of grievances, because they were originally self-proclaimed "upright people" of the old society (the "upright people" of the landlord class or the petty-bourgeoisie), and after coming to the revolutionary ranks, they thought they would be valued. Who knew that after they came, some people who seemed "unrighteous" to them actually ran ahead of them? (This is not surprising to us, because their so-called "unrighteousness" is mostly some details in life, and when they come to the new society, the environment changes and it is not difficult to correct them. Some of these people have even lower origins, and it is easier for them to accept the truth in terms of ideology and politics.) This kind of person should think calmly: How much testing have your good qualities undergone in the past? How much harm would these "sense of justice" and "enthusiasm," etc., do to the revolution and the people if they were not placed on the basis of correct class viewpoints? In the revolutionary struggle, what should be the noblest qualities? (Loyalty to the people's cause, the people's standpoint, organization, discipline, contact with the masses, etc.).

    When we tear off the "brilliant" skin from ourselves, we begin to come into contact with our own essence. If our essence is very ugly, then don't turn your head to the side, but face it squarely, and go further to analyze what dirty things you have been contaminated with from your class background, the social life you have lived, and the education you have received. Analyze your past political thought, outlook on life, morality, and other standards for distinguishing right from wrong, good from evil, and beauty from ugliness from your past behavior and thoughts. Moreover, it is not enough to just turn it over in your mind, but also to list detailed facts so that comrades can all analyze and recognize the social and class nature of these thoughts (the essence of thoughts) and their systematic context. This will prevent you from arbitrarily labeling yourself (arbitrarily saying that you have landlord thinking or liberalism, etc.), and you will see the ugliness and harm of these old ideas more clearly, and your emotions will easily turn around, and you will begin to hate and discard those bad ideological consciousnesses. At the same time, you will be able to see the things worth learning from revolutionary comrades and the working people, and you will not only want people with high cultivation to help you. This is the real beginning of your own ideological transformation. After winning the first battle in the ideological struggle, you will naturally grow in the masses and in the revolutionary ranks, and then be thoroughly transformed in the long-term revolutionary work.

　　知识分子改造自己思想的第一个战役
    ·彭庆昭·
    知识分子改造自己的思想，要靠群众、靠组织；但是，主要的还是靠自己。要把自己的思想和历史在群众面前摊开来，并且自己带头作系统的检查。这样来做，旧思想意识一定要抵抗，要经过一番相当激烈的内心斗争，因而免不了有些痛苦，但最后会使你感到洗了澡的愉快。
    许多同志，在开始使用理论的武器来改造自己的时候，只是拿着谈思想问题的文件（如毛主席的《反对自由主义》），简单地和自己对比，说：“这条毛病我有。这条毛病我没有。这一条我有一点点……。”就像小学生在测验卷子上填加减号一样。至于他说有的毛病，严重到什么程度，因而违反人民利益到了什么程度，危害自己到了什么程度，来源如何，以后怎么下工夫改正等等，都没有去想。至于他说没有的毛病，更是不去想了。
    比这进一步的，就按照文件细致地反省，列举具体事实，把文件上论述的某些毛病，从自己思想上挖掘出来。但是此外自己还有多少毛病却摸不清，对自己还不能系统的了解，对以后的努力方向也还摸不到头绪。这时情绪上因为是开始“识破”自己，所以大都不能冷静客观，许多同志到了这个阶段常常有“垮台”的感觉。以后，在同志之间互相的启发帮助下，新的观点渐渐建立，就会渐渐渡过这一难关。
    接着上述的一步，有的同志就更进而放下文件书本，拿起学到的基本观点，把自己的思想从历史上来一个大清算。这使书本上学到的基本观点，运用到分析自己的思想实际中去，使它逐渐具体化，推翻自己原有的一套评是非善恶的标准尺度，建立起新的标准尺度。
    这种大清算，在谈起自己的历史觉得“光彩照人”的人，不妨就先算算自己的历史。过去在人民与帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的斗争中，自己是作为“道德家”、“事业家”、“慈善家”，或是放荡不羁的“骚人墨客”，妆点了旧社会呢？还是真的站在人民这一边，反对了旧社会？如果你也反对了旧社会，动机又是什么？经受过多大考验？你的功绩在整个人民斗争事业中占了多大位置？这样追问自己一下，就能把迷惑自己的光彩，从自己历史上剥掉，使自己从云雾里踏到地面上来。
    还有一种人，思想上有另外一种包袱，要先清算，就是自负品质好：如“正义”、“热情”、“硬骨头”等等。这类人很多有一肚子不平之气，因为他们原是自命为旧社会的“正派人”（地主阶级的、或小资产阶级的“正派人”），到革命队伍以后，满以为会受到重视的，谁知道来了以后，原来某些在他看来并不“正派”的人，反倒跑到了他的前头。（这在我们看来并不奇怪，因为他的所谓“不正派”，大都是一些生活上的细节，到了新社会，环境一变，并不难改正。这类人有些出身更低，思想上、政治上，更容易接受真理。）这种人要平心地想一想：自己这些好品质过去受过多大考验？这些“正义感”“热情”等等，如果不放置在正确的阶级观点的基础上，对革命、对人民为害有多大？在革命斗争中，最高贵的品质究竟应该是什么？（对人民事业的忠心、人民的立场、组织性、纪律性、联系群众等等）。
    当我们把“光辉”的表皮从我们身上撕下来了的时候，就开始接触到自己的本质了。如果自己的本质是很难看的，那也不要把头扭到旁边，而要正视它，并且再进一步，开始从自己的阶级出身，以及所过的社会生活，所受的教育，来分析自己被浸染了一些什么脏东西。从过去自己的行为和思想，分析自己过去的政治思想、人生观、道德观，和其他一些分辨是非善恶美丑的标准。而且，光在脑子里转转也还不够，还要列举详细的实事，让同志们都来分析，认清这些思想的社会性、阶级性（思想的本质）及其脉络系统。这就不至于随便给自己扣帽子（随便说自己是地主思想或自由主义等等），自己对这些旧思想的丑恶与祸害也比较看得真切，情绪上也就容易转过来，开始厌恶而且丢掉那些坏的思想意识了。同时，也就能看到革命同志们和劳动人民值得自己好好学习的地方了，不至于光想要修养很高的人来帮助自己。这就是自己思想真正改造的开端。取得了思想斗争的这第一次战役的胜利之后，自己在群众中，在革命队伍中就能很自然地生长，进而在长期革命工作中得到彻底的改造。
