　　Yin Bingyan's Work in the Company Branch
    Organized by Lei Wen
    The following is Comrade Yin Bingyan's report at the organizational work conference of a certain division and regiment's eighth company, directly under the North China Military Region.

    The Eighth Company of a certain regiment of a certain division directly under the North China Military Region was originally a company with poor work. Comrade Yin Bingyan was assigned to this company to serve as a political instructor. He was initially unwilling to go, but after the work was determined, he resolutely obeyed the organization's assignment and was determined to improve the work of this company. At that time, his wife was alone at home, living in difficult circumstances, and about to give birth. She wrote to him asking him to return, but he was not affected by this in his work mood. He tried every means to improve the branch work of this company. With the help of the superior party committee, the situation of the Eighth Company greatly changed. Now all comrades in the company are striving to make progress, and the fourteen who were previously slower in progress have also made progress. When the branch leadership makes a call, the entire company responds. The enthusiasm for learning is very strong, and most of the allowance money is spent on buying learning materials. The division party committee has called on the entire division to launch a campaign to learn from Comrade Yin Bingyan. And clearly pointed out: 1. Learn from Comrade Yin Bingyan's spirit of working with peace of mind, obeying the organization, and conscientiously implementing resolutions. 2. Learn from Yin Bingyan's democratic style of contacting the masses and uniting cadres, and his spirit of adhering to principles. 3. Learn his method of resolutely implementing resolutions and checking resolutions. 4. Learn his method of ideological leadership, etc.

            The Branch Secretary Must Use His Brain to Come Up With Ideas and Be Good at Listening to the Opinions of the Masses

    The basic problem of branch work is to make the branch the highest leading body of the company, while consolidating the administrative functions of administrative cadres in the company. The branch's task is first to implement the resolutions of the higher authorities in accordance with the actual situation of the company. To do this, the branch secretary must use his brain more. For example, in the second month of training last year, the regimental committee resolved that cadres should attach importance to cultural learning, improve teaching methods, and pay attention to learning effectiveness. But the cadres of our company said, "There is no time." Is there really no time? I said that as long as we break the cadres' superficial practice of going deep into the grassroots, there will still be time. In the past, in our company, if the company commander did not visit the classes every day, he was afraid that the instructor would criticize him for not going deep into the grassroots. If the instructor didn't do this, he was afraid that the company commander would raise objections. In fact, the role of this kind of "going deep into the grassroots" is very small. If this time is saved, there will be time for learning. After discussing this matter with the cadres of several other companies, we reached a consensus that we should have a purpose when going deep into the grassroots in the future. Daily trivial tasks should be handled as much as possible during extracurricular activities, taking the soldiers' review time to organize cadre learning, focusing on cultural learning. This kind of learning has been going on from the second month of training until now. In addition, to strive for study time, we must strengthen the work of the duty officer and get rid of bureaucratism. Of course, we must tell the duty officer how to do big things, and let him boldly do small things according to principles. For example, after we cadres of several companies studied these problems, we took them to the branch committee for discussion, and the implementation was not bad. This shows that the branch secretary must first use his brain to consider the resolutions of the higher authorities and come up with his own ideas, otherwise, it will be called everyone to discuss without preparation, the purpose is not clear, and the problem will not be solved. But one person's opinion is not necessarily correct. After discussing it with several cadres, it is more confident. Otherwise, the company cadres and branch committee members will have disagreements at the branch committee meeting, which will make it difficult for other branch committee members to express their opinions. A core force should be formed among the main company cadres in the company. Once, the division transferred fourteen stronger soldiers to the artillery battalion, and party committees at all levels emphasized that good soldiers should be transferred. But if this problem is not first made the thinking of several company cadres consistent, then it is easy for someone to engage in departmentalism at the branch committee meeting. After our discussion, we smoothly implemented the resolution of the higher authorities.

            Ideological Leadership is the Guarantee for the Implementation of Branch Resolutions

    Ideological leadership is a major issue for the implementation of branch resolutions. Because the ideological situation below is not necessarily fully in line with the resolution, and there may even be places of resistance. The branch must strengthen ideological leadership to solve this problem. For example, to maintain a long-term training sustained and vigorous enthusiasm, the company leadership must first patiently help and educate comrades who are slow to make progress. Because ideological leadership is to improve everyone's awareness, if the company leadership only sees the advantages of comrades who are making rapid progress and does not see the strengths of comrades who are making slow progress, they will not be able to jump out of the circle of simply using activists, and the inspiration for those who are slow to make progress will not be great, and it will not be possible to universally improve everyone's ideological awareness. The soldier Yang Guangzhong heard that the current revolution is only "the first step of the Long March," he felt that there was no way out, wanted to commit suicide, did not apply medicine to his sores, and evaded training. Previously, the company felt that he should have been washed away long ago, and the class also stimulated him. Later, when he returned from recuperation, we changed our methods, gave him a welcome, and patiently helped him. Yang Guangzhong's thinking changed, and he felt that everyone treated him differently than before. He automatically examined himself at the class meeting and challenged his comrades, guaranteeing that he would not cause any problems. At that time, the company also wrote a play about him to praise his transformation. This shows that a person's transformation is often connected with the leadership's understanding. When the leadership's understanding of comrades who are making slow progress changes, he is more likely to change.

    Secondly, it is very important to improve the party's internal group life. Active group work can immediately discover, report, and solve problems. This cannot be called formalism. Of our company's fifteen party groups, except for the group of logistical personnel of the company headquarters, which is a little worse, they can all work actively and solve problems. It has basically formed the leadership core within the class.

    The third method of implementing resolutions is through military-political meetings, first grasping the cadres at the squad level, and conducting education work based on the branch's resolutions, combined with the ideas in the squad that conflict with the resolutions. For example, to prevent the problem of desertion, first conduct a review at the meeting of cadres above the deputy squad leader. Once the ideological problems of the cadres themselves are resolved here, the work will be easier to do.

    The fourth method of implementing resolutions is to mobilize the masses through the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee. For example, after the branch resolution inspires everyone's enthusiasm for learning, the deputy political instructor leads the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee to read aloud to everyone during roll call or meal times the military-political questions and answers that have already been answered in normal times, as well as who asked them and how they answered them, pointing out the bad ones and promoting the good ones. More than 500 copies were read in a month, which played a great role in coordinating with political classes and military education.

            Methods of Checking the Implementation of Resolutions: Branch Secretary Personally Goes Deep Into the Groups for Inspection; Convening Branch Committee Members to Report;
        Branch Committee Holds Regular Reviews

    Timely inspection of the implementation of resolutions is also very important. Since the rectification, we have established a branch committee record book, and we handle things according to this and check according to this. We have three methods for checking resolutions: one is to personally go deep into the groups to see the situation of completing the resolutions; one is to convene branch committee members to report; and one is for the branch committee to conduct regular reviews, mainly reviewing the implementation of the division of labor of the branch committee itself once every half month. The above three methods are combined with each other, because if you only go to see for yourself, time does not allow it, and if you only listen to reports, you will commit bureaucratism.

    The current shortcomings of the branch are:

    1. There is still not enough strong criticism at the branch committee meetings.

    2. There are still deviations in the understanding of the relationship between the branch committee and the branch general meeting. At the branch general meeting, it has not been possible to seriously conduct a comprehensive summary report, listen to everyone's opinions and criticisms, only know that the strength of party members is great, and tasks can be completed with one mobilization, there is a purely using point of view, and there is the idea of putting the branch committee above the branch general meeting.

    3. Not enough conscious cultivation and development of party members. For example, many activists appeared among the liberated soldiers of the Pingjin Campaign, but there was not enough research on how to cultivate and develop them.

            Division of Labor and Cooperation Collective Leadership

    The branch committee must discuss issues comprehensively, and cannot discuss ideological issues today and ideological issues tomorrow. Taking our company as an example, military education, ideological leadership, strengthening the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, carrying out sports, improving food, and large economic expenditures are all discussed. Every Friday night, the branch secretary and branch committee members meet to determine what issues to solve at the branch committee meeting tomorrow. And divide the topics for everyone to prepare speeches. Only in this way can they prepare opinions based on the actual situation of their platoon and squad. The advantage of doing this is that it changes the phenomenon of coming to the meeting just to receive tasks. At the very least, he has to talk about the opinions he has prepared. During the discussion, the opinions that the main cadres have discussed in advance cannot be encircled, because their opinions are not necessarily complete. We must be good at adopting everyone's opinions. The branch secretary takes notes of everyone's speeches during our meetings, summarizes the good ones, and criticizes and explains the incorrect ones. In addition, there must be a center for making resolutions, otherwise, everyone will be confused when the meeting is over and will not know where to start. For example, after the complete liberation of North China last year, the idea of demobilization and transfer to civilian work grew in the troops. The branch clearly put forward the call: The open and hidden enemies have not been completely eliminated, and the southward army is climbing mountains and ridges to fight. We must establish the idea of always being a combat team. And put forward the idea of working hard to learn and become truly versatile people's soldiers. With a clear call, everyone will do according to this goal. Immediately following is the division of labor. We have a large division of labor and a small division of labor. The large division of labor is fixed: the company commander is responsible for education and mastering the system; the political instructor is responsible for ideological leadership, branch work, and political education; the deputy political instructor leads the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee; and the deputy company commander is responsible for improving food and managing the logistical personnel of the company headquarters. The small division of labor is to divide up the temporary things in the usual meetings and do them separately. Division of labor also requires cooperation. I personally have an experience that when I feel awkward in my work, it is very helpful if someone points out a clear way to me. Conversely, the same is true for others. In the past, the deputy company commander ran into a snag with the quartermaster when improving food. We told him about the quartermaster's background and characteristics, and told him what methods to use to control the quartermaster. Later, the deputy company commander did a very good job and was very happy. Division of labor also requires mutual assistance. Sometimes I replace the company commander when he is not at home for military class. Everyone helps each other to supplement when making summaries, and the opinions are more complete.

    The whole company responded to the branch's call, and the enthusiasm for learning is very strong.

　　阴炳彦的连队支部工作
    雷文整理
    下面是阴炳彦同志在华北军区组织工作会议上的报告。
    人民解放军华北军区直属某师某团八连，原是一个工作较差的连队。阴炳彦同志被分配到这个连去担任政治指导员。他本不愿去，但在工作确定后，便坚决的服从组织分配，并下决心把这连的工作搞好。当时他妻子一人在家，生活困难，又要生孩子，写信要他回去，但他没有被这影响到工作情绪。他想尽各种办法，改进这个连队的支部工作。加上上级党委的帮助，八连的情况大大改变。现在全连同志都努力追求进步，原先进步比较慢的十四个人现在也都进步了。支部领导上提个号召，全连都能响应。学习情绪很旺盛，津贴费大都买了学习用具。该师师党委已号召全师展开学习阴炳彦同志运动。并明确指出：一、学习阴炳彦同志安心工作，服从组织，认真执行决议的精神。二、学习阴炳彦联系群众，团结干部的民主作风和坚持原则的精神。三、学习他坚决贯彻决议检查决议的方法。四、学习他思想领导的方法等。
            支部书记要用脑子出主意并善于听取群众意见
    支部工作的基本问题是要使支部成为连队的最高领导机关，同时巩固行政干部在连队中的行政职权。支部的任务首先是根据连队实际情况贯彻上级决议。要作到这一点，支书就得多用脑子。比方去年练兵第二个月，团委决议要干部重视文化学习，改进教学方法，注意学习效果。但我们连的干部们却说：“没有时间。”究竟有没有时间呢？我说只要打破干部形式上的深入下层的作法，时间还是有的。过去我们连里，要是连长每天不到班里转转就怕指导员批评说不深入下层。指导员不这么作，也怕连长提意见。其实这种“深入下层”的作用是很微小的。如果把这个时间誉出来就有了学习时间了。这事跟其他几个连干部研究后取得了一致意见，都认为今后深入下层时要有目的。日常琐碎事务工作尽量用课外活动时间去处理，拿战士复习时间，组织干部学习，以文化学习为主。这种学习从练兵第二个月到现在都坚持下来了。另外要争取学习时间就得加强值班员的工作，摆脱事务主义，当然大事要告诉值班员怎么做，小事就要放手让他大胆地根据原则去做。像上面这些问题，先由我们几个连干部研究后，再拿到支委会上去讨论，执行还不错。这说明支书对上级决议要先用脑子考虑，自己拿个主意，不然叫大家毫无准备地讨论，目的不明确，问题也得不到解决。但一个人的意见不见得对，经过几个干部商讨就比较有把握。不然连干部支委在支委会上闹分歧，就使其他支委们不好发表意见了。在连里几个主要连干部应该形成个核心力量。有一回师里调十四个强些的战士到炮兵营去，各级党委都强调要调好战士去。但是这问题如不先使几个连干部思想一致，那么在支委会上就容易有人闹本位主义。我们经过讨论后就很顺畅地执行了上级决议。
            思想领导是贯彻支部决议的保证
    对贯彻支部决议，思想领导是个大事。因为下面思想情况与决议不见得完全符合，甚至可能有抵触的地方。支部必须以加强思想领导去解决这个问题。比如要保持长期整训的持久旺盛情绪，连队领导上首先要耐心帮助教育进步慢的同志。因为思想领导是要提高大家的觉悟，连队领导上如果只看到进步快的同志的优点，看不到进步慢的同志的长处，就跳不出单纯使用积极分子的圈子，对于进步慢的启示就不大，也就不能普遍提高大家的思想觉悟。战士杨广忠听说现在的革命才是“万里长征走完第一步”，他认为没出路了，想自杀，生疮不上药，逃避整训。先前连里认为早该洗刷他，班里也刺激他。后来他休养回来，我们改换了办法，来了个欢迎，并耐心帮助他。杨广忠思想转变了，他觉得大家对待他和以前不一样了，自动在班务会上检讨了自己，并向同志们挑战，保证不闹任何问题。当时连里还把他编了戏，表扬他的转变。这说明一个人的转变同领导上的认识常是相连着的，领导上对进步慢的同志的认识转变了，他就容易转变。
    其次健全党内小组生活是很重要的一环。小组工作活跃就能即时发现、汇报、解决问题。这不能称之为形式主义。我们连十五个党的小组，除连部勤杂人员小组差些外，都能主动工作，解决问题。基本上已经形成了班内的领导核心。
    贯彻决议第三个办法是通过军政会议，首先抓住班一级的干部，根据支部决议，联系班里与决议抵触的思想进行教育工作。如防止逃亡问题，首先在副班长以上的干部会上进行检讨，干部本身的思想问题在这里搞通了，工作就好搞了。
    贯彻决议第四个办法是通过革命军人委员会发动群众。如支部决议启发大家学习情绪后，副政指领导革命军人委员会把平时军政问答中已经答出来的以及问过谁、谁怎样答的，利用点名或吃饭时念给大家听，指出不好的，发扬好的。一个月就念了五百多份，对讲政治课和军事教育配合上起了很大作用。
            检查决议执行的方法：支书亲自深入小组检查；召集支委汇报；
        支委会定期检讨
    及时检查决议的执行也是很重要的。自整训以来我们就建立了支委会记录本，按照这个办事，也按着这个检查。我们检查决议有三个办法：一是亲自深入到小组去看完成决议的情形；一是召集支委汇报；一是支委会定期检讨，半月一次主要是检讨支委本身执行分工情形。以上三种办法是互相结合的，因为光亲自去看，时间不允许，光听汇报，就要犯官僚主义。
    支部现存的几个缺点是：
    一、支委会上强有力的批评还不够。
    二、支委会和支部大会的关系，认识上还有偏差。在支部大会上还没有作到认真地进行全面总结报告，听取大家意见和批评，只知道党员力量大，一动员就能完成任务，有单纯使用的观点，有把支委会放在支部大会上面的思想。
    三、有意识地培养发展党员不够，如平津战役的解放战士中出现了许多积极分子，没很好研究如何培养发展。
            分工合作  集体领导
    支委会讨论问题要全面，不能今天讨论是思想问题明天讨论还是思想问题。拿我们连来说，军事教育、思想领导、加强革命军人委员会、开展体育、改善伙食、大的经济开支等都讨论。每逢星期五晚上，支书和支委们碰碰头，确定好明天开支委会解决甚么问题。并把题目分给大家准备发言。只有这样才能让他们根据本排、班的实际情况准备意见。这样做的好处是把开会就是来受领任务的现象改变了，最低限度他得把自己准备的意见讲讲。在讨论时还不能让几个主要干部事先讨论好的意见圈圈套住，因为他们的意见不见得完整。必须善于采纳大家的意见。我们开会时大家的发言，支书都记下，把好的归纳起来，不正确的进行批评和解释。另外，作决议得有个中心，不然散会时稀里糊涂，不知从那头作起。比方去年华北完全解放后，部队中复员转业的思想滋长。支部便明确提出号召：公开的和隐蔽的敌人还没有完全消灭，南下大军正在爬山越岭打仗，我们要树立永远是战斗队的思想。并提出努力学习，练成真正文武双全的人民战士。明确了号召，大家就照着这个目标做。紧跟着就得分工。我们有大分工和小分工。大分工是固定的：连长负责教育和掌握制度；政治指导员负责思想领导、支部工作、政治教育；副政指领导革命军人委员会；副连长负责改善伙食和对连部勤杂人员的管理。小分工则是平时碰头中的临时事情也分头去干。分工还得合作。我个人有个体验，自己在工作中觉得蹩扭了，这时若是旁人给指出个明道来，帮助很大。反过来别人也是一样。过去副连长为改善伙食碰了特务长的钉子。我们就把特务长这个人的出身、特点，给他讲了，告诉他用甚么方法去掌握特务长。以后副连长作的很不错，心里挺高兴。分工还要互相协助，有时上军事课连长不在家我就去代替。作总结时大家互相帮助补充，意见就圆满得多了。（附图片）
    全连响应了支部号召，学习情绪很旺盛。
