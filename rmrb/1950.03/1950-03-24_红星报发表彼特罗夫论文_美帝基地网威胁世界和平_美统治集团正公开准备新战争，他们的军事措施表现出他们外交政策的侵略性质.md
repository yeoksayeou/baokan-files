Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 22nd: The Red Star newspaper published a thesis by Petrov entitled "American Military Bases—A Threat to the Peace and Security of All Nations," stating: The US ruling clique is openly preparing for a new world war. The military measures they are implementing clearly demonstrate the aggressive nature of their diplomacy. These measures include establishing and expanding a network of US naval and air force bases around the world.

The Pacific region, with its vast sources of strategic raw materials and cheap labor, has aroused the interest of Wall Street monopolies, making it one of the areas where American intrusion is particularly prominent. During wartime and in the post-war period, the United States built approximately 200 naval and air force bases there, in addition to the bases already existing in the Pacific.

The United States extensively utilizes the Japanese bases it occupies in Japan. The United States occupies Japan and transforms it into its military bridgehead in the Far East, blatantly violating the Potsdam Conference resolutions and the subsequent Far Eastern Commission resolutions.

A typical example of the Wall Street monopolies' predatory policy in the Pacific region is the American rule in the Philippines, an island nation occupying a favorable military-strategic location in the western Pacific.

US Imperialism Vainly Attempts to Use Taiwan as a Major Stronghold to Intimidate the Growing Asian National Liberation Movement

In the post-war period, the American imperialists regarded Kuomintang China as the main base for establishing their hegemony in Asia. However, the victory of the Chinese people over the bankrupt Kuomintang clique and foreign imperialists declared the complete failure of the American plans in China. As the American imperialists successively lost the positions they had seized in China, they expanded military construction in Taiwan. The United States built new airports and naval bases there. Foreign newspapers have pointed out that the US ruling clique intends to use Taiwan as one of their main strongholds, from which they can intimidate the growing Asian national liberation movement.

American imperialists are very active in the Mediterranean. According to newspaper reports, Franco has handed over several Spanish naval bases to his Washington guardians, and the reconstruction and refitting of these naval bases are being carried out under the guidance of the US Naval Delegation. Franco is also happy to hand over the country's territory for the use of the US Air Force. The United States is also engaged in expansion in Italy, with air and naval bases being established on Italian territory.

On the African coast of the Mediterranean, the United States has transformed the Mellaha airfield in Tripoli into its air force base. According to newspaper reports, the United States is attempting to sign an agreement with France to gain the right to station troops in strategically important areas of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.

As for the Near East and Middle East countries, the New York Post has admitted that the United States intends to establish a series of military bases on a vast stretch of land, from Iran and Turkey to Egypt.

American imperialists are also persistently trying to expand the US military base network to countries in the Atlantic region. For example, for this purpose, they have surveyed several locations in the British Isles (original unclear) that interest them; in 1948, with the consent of the British government (which has handed over the fate of Britain to the American army), several British airports were handed over to the US Air Force Command.

Since the end of World War II, the American rulers have shown an increasing desire to expand the American military base network in the North Atlantic and the Arctic. The Canadian Minister of National Defence was forced to admit in Parliament that some airports on Canadian territory are still used by the American Command and managed by American military forces. The attempt to obtain more bridgeheads in the North Atlantic has determined the activities of American imperialism in Iceland and Greenland.

The United States has many bases in almost every Latin American country.

Petrov wrote that the existence of American naval and air force bases, spread all over the globe, constantly reminds people of the threat to peace represented by the predatory plans of American imperialism. They provide obvious proof of the aggressive policies of American warmongers, who harbor mad plans to seize world hegemony.

    美帝基地网威胁世界和平
    美统治集团正公开准备新战争，他们的军事措施表现出他们外交政策的侵略性质
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：红星报发表彼特罗夫题为《美国的军事基地——对各国和平与安全的威胁》的论文称：美国统治集团正在公开准备新的世界战争。他们所实施的军事措施，清楚地表现出他们外交政策的侵略性质。在这些措施中，包括在世界各地建立和扩大美国海空军基地网。
    太平洋区域因有战略原料与廉价劳动的巨大来源，引起了华尔街垄断企业的兴趣，因而，它是美国的侵入特别显著的地区之一。在战时以及战后，除了太平洋原来已有的基地之外，美国又在那里建筑了大约二百个海空军基地。
    美国在日本广泛地利用它所占领的日本基地。美国占领着日本，并把日本变成它在远东的军事桥头堡，横暴地违反了波茨坦会议的决议和后来的远东委员会的决议。
    华尔街垄断企业在太平洋区域的掠夺政策的典型，是美国在菲律宾的统治，这个岛国在太平洋西部占有有利的军事战略位置。
    美帝妄图利用台湾作为主要据点来威吓日益增长的亚洲民族解放运动
    在战后时期，美国帝国主义者把国民党中国当作建立他们在亚洲霸权的主要基地。然而中国人民对破产的国民党集团与外国帝国主义者的胜利，宣布了美国在中国的计划完全失败。当美国帝国主义者接连失掉他们在中国所攫取的阵地时，他们就在台湾扩大军事建筑。美国在那里建筑了新的机场和海军基地。外国报界曾指出：美国统治集团打算利用台湾作为他们的主要据点之一，从这个地方，他们可以威吓日益增长的亚洲民族解放运动。
    美国帝国主义者在地中海甚为活跃。据报纸消息：佛朗哥已把西班牙的若干海军基地交给他的华盛顿监护者，这些海军基地的重建与改装设备的工作，正在美国海军代表团的指导下进行。佛朗哥同样欣然地把该国的领土交给美国空军使用。美国亦正在意大利从事扩张，空军和海军基地正在意大利的领土上建立起来。
    在地中海的非洲海岸上，美国已把的黎波里的麦拉哈机场，变为它的空军基地。据报纸消息：美国企图与法国签订一项协定，使它获得在突尼西亚、阿尔及利亚及摩洛哥的战略重要地区驻军的权利。
    至于近东与中东各国，纽约邮报已承认：美国打算在广大的土地上建立一连串的军事基地，自伊朗和土耳其起，迄埃及为止。
    美国帝国主义者并坚持地试图把美国军事基地网扩张到大西洋地区各国。例如，为了这个目的，他们曾考查了英伦三岛（原文不清）使他们感兴趣的若干地点；一九四八年在英政府（它已把英国的命运交给美国军队）的同意之下，英国若干机场已交给美国空军指挥部。
    自从二次世界大战结束以来，美国的统治者们一直表现日益希望扩大在北大西洋和北极的美国军事基地网。加拿大国防部长在议会中被迫承认：在加拿大领土上仍然有一些机场由美国指挥部使用，并由美国军事部队管理。在北大西洋取得更多桥头堡的企图，决定了美国帝国主义在冰岛与格陵兰的活动。
    美国在几乎一切拉丁美洲国家内有许多基地。
    彼特洛夫写道，布满了全球的美国海空军基地的存在，经常地使人想起美国帝国主义掠夺计划所代表的对和平的威胁。它们提供了美国战争贩子的侵略政策的明显证明，而美国战争贩子是怀着夺取世界霸权的疯狂计划的。
