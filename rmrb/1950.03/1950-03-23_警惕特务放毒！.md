To the Editor:

　　Recently, we discovered multiple cases of Kuomintang spies poisoning wells in the fifth district of Fugou County, Henan Province, and arrested three poisoners. Fortunately, these incidents were discovered early, and no one was harmed. We believe that as the Kuomintang bandit gang's armed forces are defeated, they will strengthen the activities of lurking spies to continue to be enemies of the people. Such incidents may also occur elsewhere; therefore, we specifically write down the details and send them to you for publication to raise everyone's vigilance.

　　At the end of February, in the Jifu Li area of our district, villagers discovered two beggar-like people suspiciously pacing around the well, constantly peering around. When the villagers stepped forward to question them, they looked flustered and spoke evasively. As a result, half a catty of yellowish-brown poison, resembling rabbit droppings, was found on them. In Hou Xie's home, a farmer in San Suo Lou Village near Dige, a fifty-year-old poisoner was also caught, with seventeen packets of bright red poison on him. The villagers put the poison in water to test it, and the water foamed and bubbled, as if boiling. The villagers then used the poisoned water to make steamed buns to feed a dog, and the dog died three hours after eating the buns. Poisoning phenomena have also been discovered in Cuiqiao Town.

　　The district government has now notified all townships to pay attention to preventing spies from poisoning, and other places should also pay attention.

### 警惕特务放毒！

　　警惕特务放毒！编辑同志：
    最近我们河南扶沟县第五区发现国民党特务在井内放毒事件多起，并捉住放毒犯三人。尚幸这些事情发现得早，没人遭害。我们想，在国民党匪帮武装力量被打垮而加强潜伏特务活动继续与人民为敌的时候，这种事情在别的地方也会发生；所以特地把经过情形写出来，寄给你们发表，以提高大家的警惕。
    二月末，在本区集富李一带，有村民发现两个乞丐似的人，鬼鬼祟祟地在井旁踱来踱去，并且不时向四外窥视。村民上前盘问，他们两个神色慌张，言语支吾；结果，在他们身上搜出草黄色、像兔子粪似的毒药半斤。在底阁附近三所楼村农民侯协家中，也捉住了一个五十岁的放毒犯，身上有大红色毒药十七包。村民把毒药放到水里试一下，水翻花作声，沸腾起来；村民又把毒水做成馍来喂狗，狗吃了馍三个钟头后便死了。另外在崔桥镇也发现有放毒现象。
    现在区政府已通知各乡注意防止特务放毒，其他地方也应该注意。
          赵克俭、李莲塘
