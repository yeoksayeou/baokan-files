Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th (via TASS): On March 12th, the Soviet capital Moscow and the entire country, amidst a joyous festive atmosphere, held elections for the highest organ of state power—the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. According to regulations, the elections were to begin at 6:00 AM on the 12th, but many polling stations were already crowded with voters before 6:00 AM, eager to cast their ballots for the candidates from the League of Communist Party members and non-Party individuals. The earliest to hold elections in the country were the residents of Cape Dezhnev, the northernmost point in northeastern Siberia. When they began voting at 6:00 AM on the 12th, it was still 8:00 PM on the 11th in Moscow. In the Stalin electoral district of the capital, where the great leader of the working people, Stalin, was a candidate, all voters had cast their ballots by noon. In the Molotov electoral district of the capital, where Molotov was a candidate, and the Krasnaya Presnya electoral district, where Shtirova was a candidate, 100% of the voters had cast their ballots by 2:00 PM.

As the heroic city of Leningrad awoke, it was adorned with flags, slogans, and portraits, looking brand new. Life in this city began even earlier than usual today. At exactly 6:00 AM, many workers who had participated in Stakhanovite overtime shifts during the night went directly from the factory to the various polling stations located in magnificent buildings, without even going home to rest. Due to the extreme enthusiasm of the voters, by 5:00 PM, 99.4% of the city's voters had cast their ballots, and in many electoral districts, all voting had been completed. Molchiku, a steelworker from the Kirov factory, said after voting: "I—an ordinary worker—have today cast my vote for the candidates from Stalin's League of Party Members and Non-Party Individuals, for peace and communism, for the happiness of the working people."

In the countryside, Soviet peasants enthusiastically participated in the elections. From the western border to the Far East, every village was filled with great enthusiasm and joyful songs. In villages near the border in the Rovno Oblast, all voters had cast their ballots. In Lithuania, voting in all villages was nearly completed by noon.

In the cities and villages of eastern Siberia, the elections were conducted like a celebration. The streets of Irkutsk were crowded with people early in the morning, and by noon, all voters in some polling stations had cast their ballots. In Vladivostok, some voters arrived at the polling stations as early as 5:00 AM. Voting in all electoral districts of Vladivostok was extremely enthusiastic.

To facilitate voting for voters who were traveling, small electoral districts were established on Soviet ships and trains. The Soviet ship "Ilyich," sailing near Singapore, also held voting at 6:00 AM local time and completed it by 7:00 AM. On the Vladivostok-Moscow railway line, passengers on the seventh express train began voting at 6:00 AM local time, and a large number of passengers had cast their ballots within half an hour.

    苏联各地区选民踊跃投票
    选举党与非党联盟候选人
    【新华社北京十三日电】综合塔斯社消息：三月十二日，苏联首都莫斯科及全国各地在万分欢腾的节日气氛中，举行国家最高权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃的选举。选举规定于十二日晨六时开始，但许多投票处早在六时以前即挤满了前往投票选举联共党与非党联盟代表候选人的选民。全国最早举行投票的是苏联东北部最北角上的威伦岬的居民。当他们于十二日晨六时举行投票时，莫斯科还是十一日晚上八时。在莫斯科以劳动人民伟大领袖斯大林为候选人的首都斯大林选区，全体选民在中午时都已投完了票。以莫洛托夫为候选人的首都莫洛托夫选区及以什蒂罗娃为候选人的红普列斯尼亚选区，至下午二时，百分之百的选民都投了票。
    当英雄的列宁格勒城醒来时，它已被旗帜、标语和画像打扮得锦簇一新。这个城市的生活今天比平时开始得更早些。六时整，许多在夜间参加斯塔哈诺夫式加班的工人，下工后还没有回家休息即迳自工厂前往设在华丽大厦中的各个投票处。由于选民投票的极度踊跃，至下午五时止，全市百分之九十九点四的选民都投完了票，不少选区，已全部投票完毕。基洛夫工厂炼钢工人莫尔齐区在投票后说：“我——一个普通工人，今天为了和平与共产主义，为了劳动人民的幸福，已投了斯大林党与非党联盟候选人的票。”
    在农村中，苏维埃农民踊跃参加选举。从西部边疆到远东，每个村庄都洋溢着高度的热情与快乐的歌声。在罗夫州靠近边界的村庄中，所有选民都已投了票。在立陶宛，所有村庄的投票，在中午时投票已近结束。
    在西伯利亚东部的城市与乡村中，选举像庆祝节日一般地进行。伊尔库茨克街道上清早就挤满了人群，到中午时，若干投票处全部选民已投完了票。在海参威，有些选区的选民在清晨五时就赶到了投票处。海参威所有选区的投票情形都极为热烈。
    为了便利在旅途中的选民的投票，苏联轮船与火车上都建立了小选举区。航行在新加坡附近的苏轮伊里奇号，也于当地六时举行了投票，并于七时投完了票。在海参威——莫斯科铁路线上，七次快车上的旅客们于当地上午六时开始投票，半小时内，大批旅客们都投完了票。
