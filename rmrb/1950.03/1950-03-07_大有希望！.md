Great Prospects!

　　This newspaper publishes two important financial news items today. One is that the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has cleared out more than 10,000 vehicles; the other is that Huolu County has automatically reduced its budget by 30 percent. These two news items indicate that our fiscal revenue contains the possibility of increasing, and our expenditure contains the possibility of saving. The example of the Ministry of Railways is merely a sub-item in the inventory of warehouses in terms of central fiscal revenue; the example of Huolu is merely one county out of more than 2,000 counties nationwide. If this situation appears on a large scale in all aspects of national fiscal revenue and expenditure items, it will change the face of national finance.

　　What does the experience of the Ministry of Railways in clearing vehicles tell us? A basic experience is that in the state institutions we took over, which had been under the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang for a long time, a large number of materials were buried and wasted. If we grasp the situation of these materials and convert them into fiscal revenue and production capital, it will greatly help the country's financial and economic situation. The key lies in clearing and checking. If we do not check, we cannot understand the situation of these materials and cannot change this wasteful phenomenon. It must be pointed out that in the past two years, after we took over a large number of cities, many institutions have not done enough in the work of clearing the materials they received. Most of them stopped at the general reception work without carefully and deeply checking. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government is one of the earliest established, strongest, and most successful units among the various ministries of the Central People's Government, yet more than 10,000 vehicles were not discovered after a year in 1949. This fully reflects the depth of corruption in the old Kuomintang bureaucratic institutions we took over. If we do not carry out in-depth inspection work, we cannot fully understand the situation. In 1949, when the Ministry of Railways was completing the transportation tasks in the north, there were still many goods that could not be transported due to insufficient vehicles, while on the other hand, more than 2,000 usable vehicles were not used in a planned manner. There are many warehouses in major cities across the country, especially in places like Shanghai where warehouses are concentrated. The results of clearing them up will definitely be amazing. The experience of the Ministry of Railways also shows that such clearing work cannot be completed casually. It must have extensive and in-depth mobilization work, specific organizational work, and be led by the highest responsible cadres to be completed. Some units assign the work of clearing materials to general cadres, or even mainly rely on the old personnel in the original Kuomintang institutions. This cannot solve the problem.

　　Huolu County's automatic reduction of the county budget for 1950 by 30 percent is a major event. Although we do not yet know whether the final audit result of the county's budget is completely correct, it is already worthy of attention from all localities based on the materials reported. Because, when the county government finally audited the budget, it basically grasped several basic principles of preparing the budget, thereby greatly reducing expenditures. The first principle is that local budgets must be "living within one's means," unlike the central budget, which must combine "living within one's means" and "spending according to income." Therefore, the local budget can only be how much money there is, how much to do, the question is to maximize the effectiveness of these funds. That is, in the central government's budget, all departments should also carefully consider the spirit of living within one's means in each department's budget. The second principle is to distinguish between priorities and urgencies, rather than "undertaking everything at once." For example, martyrs' towers, etc., can be postponed, so don't do them immediately. The third is to clarify responsibilities and avoid duplication. Taking the county government as an example, the expenses required for matters that should be handled by the superior (prefecture) or lower (village) government agencies should be budgeted separately by them, and should not be included in the county government's budget. The same should be true in peer-level agencies. The fourth principle is to verify. How much money is needed is how much money it is, do not overestimate, do not falsely report. For example, the new standard for teachers' salaries in the county is an average of 165 catties per person per month, so it should not be reported as 200 catties. Units that should be enterprise-oriented, such as nurseries, should be budgeted as enterprises, and should not be included in the administrative budget.

　　The above two things are just an example, which is what Chairman Mao said at the fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2 last year: "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope."

　　The decision on unifying national financial and economic work passed by the State Council of the Central People's Government on March 3 has clear provisions on the methods of clearing materials and saving expenditures, which will be universally implemented in all localities and departments across the country. The two facts mentioned here all appeared before the announcement of this decision by the State Council. This powerfully proves from the two aspects of clearing materials and saving expenditures that the State Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work is completely achievable and completely capable of being realized. As long as all localities and departments across the country learn from this good experience and work together, we will definitely be able to fully implement the decision of the State Council and overcome the financial difficulties and the chaotic and wasteful phenomena in financial and economic work.

### 大有希望！

　　大有希望！
    本报今日发表两个重要的财经消息。一个是中央人民政府铁道部清查出一万多车辆；一个是获鹿县预算自动核减了百分之三十。这两个消息表示：我们财政收入方面包含着增加的可能；支出方面包含着节约的可能。铁道部的例子不过是中央财政收入方面清理仓库一项中的一个子目；获鹿的例子不过是全国二千余县中之一个县而已。如果这种情况大量出现在全国财政收支项目的各方面，就将改变国家财政的面貌。
    铁道部清查车辆的经验告诉我们什么呢？一条基本经验是：我们所接收的长期被国民党腐败统治的国家机构中，有大批物资在埋藏着、浪费着。如果掌握了这些物资的情况，并把这些物资转为财政的收入与生产的资本，对于国家的财政经济情况必大有帮助。而关键即在于清理检查。如果不加以检查，我们就不能了解这些物资情况，就不能改变这种浪费现象。必须指出，近两年来，我们接管了大批城市之后，许多机关对于所接收的物资的清查工作是作得不够的。多半停止于一般的接收工作，而没有仔细深入进行检查。中央人民政府铁道部是中央人民政府所属各部中成立较早、基础较强、成绩较大的单位，尚且有一万多个车辆经过一九四九年一年的时间而未被发现。这可以充分反映我们所接收的旧国民党官僚机构腐败之深。如果我们不进行深入的检查工作，是不能全部了解情况的。铁道部一九四九年在完成北方的运输任务时，曾因为车辆不足，还有不少货物不能运走，而另一方面则有二千多辆可用的车辆未被有计划地使用。全国各大城市有许多仓库，特别像上海那样仓库集中的地方，清查起来，结果一定是惊人的。铁道部的经验同时表明，这样的清查工作，不是随随便便可以完成的，而必须有广泛与深入的动员工作、具体的组织工作，并由最高负责干部亲自领导，才能完成。有些单位把清理物资工作交给一般干部去作，甚至主要依靠原国民党机关中旧人员去作。这样，是不能解决问题的。
    获鹿县自动核减一九五○年县预算百分之三十，是一件大事。虽然我们还不知道该县预算最后审核的结果，是否完全正确，但就已经报导出来的材料看，已经值得各地重视。因为，该县政府在最后审核预算时，基本上掌握了编制预算的几个基本原则，因而使支出大为减少。第一个原则是地方预算必须是“量入为出”，不似中央预算必须以“量入为出”与“量出为入”相结合。那么，地方预算只能是有多少钱，办多少事，问题在于尽量使这些钱的效力加大。即在中央政府预算中，各部门也应当仔细考虑各该部预算中量入为出这个精神。第二个原则是分别轻重缓急，而不是“百废俱举”。比方，烈士塔等是可以缓办的，就不要马上就办。第三是分清责任、避免重复。以县政府来说，凡是上级（专署）或下级（村）政府机关所应当办的事，其所需的经费即应由他们分别去作预算，而不要再列在县政府的预算内。在平级机关里也应当如此。第四个原则是核实。需要多少钱，就是多少钱，不要虚估，不要虚报。如该县教员薪金的新标准，平均每人每月一六五斤，就不应报二百斤。苗圃等应当企业化的单位，就应当作企业化预算，不应一律编入行政预算之内。
    以上两件事不过是一个例子，就是毛主席在去年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上所说的：“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的”的例子。
    中央人民政府政务院三月三日所通过的关于统一全国财经工作的决定，其中对于清理物资和节约支出的办法均有明确的规定，即将在全国各地方各部门普遍执行。这里所说的两件事实都是在政务院这一决定公布前出现的。这就从清理物资与节约支出两个方面有力地证明了政务院统一全国财政经济决定，是完全应当实现，完全能够实现的。只要全国各地方各部门，学习这种好的经验，一致努力，我们就一定能够完满地执行政务院的决定，克服财政困难和财经工作中的混乱浪费现象。
