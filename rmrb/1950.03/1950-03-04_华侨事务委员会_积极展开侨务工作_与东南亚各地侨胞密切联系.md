Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: Since its establishment in November last year, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government has been actively working on assisting in the remittance of overseas Chinese funds, publicizing to and connecting with overseas Chinese, and handling returned overseas Chinese students. After the liberation of Guangdong and Fujian, in order to facilitate overseas Chinese to support their relatives in China, the Commission helped the People's Bank of China and the Bank of China collect relevant information on overseas remittances and assisted in formulating temporary management measures for overseas remittances in Guangdong and Fujian provinces to stabilize the lives of overseas Chinese relatives. When the People's Victory Discount Public Bonds began to be issued, He Xiangning, Chairman of the Commission, and Commissioners Situ Meitang, Peng Zemin, Cai Tingkai, and Chen Qiyuan successively broadcast speeches to overseas Chinese, calling on them to actively subscribe to the bonds. In order to deeply understand the situation of overseas Chinese in various places, the Commission has now established close contact with overseas Chinese democratic newspapers in Southeast Asia and established regular communications. As the number of overseas Chinese students returning to China increases, the Commission invited representatives from relevant agencies and organizations on January 31 to hold a symposium on the issue of schooling for returned overseas Chinese students, and decided that the Student Union would assist the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in handling the matter. Since January, the Commission has sent special personnel to receive overseas Chinese students arriving in Beijing one after another and solve their enrollment problems separately.

    积极展开侨务工作
    与东南亚各地侨胞密切联系
    【新华社北京三日电】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会自去年十一月成立以来，在协助沟通侨汇、对侨胞的宣传和联系及处理回国华侨学生等方面都已积极展开工作。当广东、福建解放以后，为便利侨胞接济国内侨眷，该会即帮助人民银行和中国银行搜集有关侨汇资料、协助制订粤、闽两省的管理侨汇暂行办法，以安定侨眷生活。人民胜利折实公债开始发行时，该会主任委员何香凝、委员司徒美堂、彭泽民、蔡廷锴、陈其瑗等，先后向海外侨胞广播演说，号召侨胞踊跃认购公债。该会为了要深入了解各地侨胞情况，该会目前已和东南亚各地华侨民主报纸取得密切联系，建立了经常通讯。由于回国华侨学生日多，该会曾于一月三十一日邀请有关机关、团体的代表，举行了归国侨生就学问题座谈会，决定由学生联合会协助华侨事务委员会负责办理。一月以来，该会派专人招待陆续到京侨生，并分别解决其入学问题。
