　　Beijing News: The Beijing Performing Arts Circle Association held a get-together for female performers and female family members of the performing arts circle at the Dazhong Amusement Park at 9:00 AM on February 28th. Nearly 200 people attended. Fang Hua of the Literature and Art Division of the Bureau of Culture and Education, Feng Shiliang of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, Che Nai'gang of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles Preparatory Committee, and three students from the Women's Production and Education Institute also attended. In addition to performances by Gu Rongfu, Wei Xikui, Guan Xuezeng (performing "Four Persuasions"), and Quick-Hands Liu (performing magic tricks), there was also free discussion. The female performers unanimously agreed that they had suffered all kinds of oppression and restrictions in the old society, and that women had only truly been liberated and gained a real position in society after liberation. Sun Yanqin of the performing arts circle said: "I was sold to the owner of a brothel as an adopted daughter in the past and made a living by singing; I was only liberated after I voluntarily went to the Education Institute to study. I am grateful to the People's Government for their concern. I will no longer be oppressed by the old society." Tang Yuying, a student at the Women's Production and Education Institute, said: "I used to be a singer, and I was reduced to prostitution due to the oppression and deception of the old society. I was no longer oppressed after the brothels were closed. After studying and reforming, I have become a new woman of the new society." Feng Shiliang, the representative of the Women's Federation, pointed out: "Sisters suffered all kinds of oppression and pain in the old society, and they have only been liberated now. We must study hard and work hard." Lian Kuoru of the performing arts circle said: "We must improve our performing arts work in the future and strengthen education, first of all, educate ourselves, and then we can educate the broad masses of the people." Finally, Wei Xikui and Cao Baolu called on the performing arts circle to prepare more than 20 new programs related to women for performance on International Working Women's Day on March 8th to show their celebration.

　　京曲艺界女艺员举行联欢会
    【北京讯】京市曲艺界公会于二月二十八日上午九时在大众游艺社举行曲艺界女艺员和女家属联欢会。到会近二百人。文教局文艺处方华、市民主妇联冯世亮、文联筹备会车乃刚等均出席；妇女生产教养院的学员也有三位参加。会上除由顾荣甫、魏喜奎、关学增等表演“四劝”、快手刘表演戏法外，并有自由讲话。女艺员们一致认为她们在旧社会中受到种种压迫与束缚，解放以后，妇女们才真正翻了身，在社会上才真正有了地位。曲艺界孙艳琴说：“我过去被卖给妓院的老板作养女，一直以卖唱为生；自从我自愿地到教养学院习后，才得到了解放。我感谢人民政府对我的关切。我再也不受旧社会的压迫了。”妇女生产教养院学员唐玉英说：“我从前也是卖唱的，由于旧社会的压迫与诱骗而沦为妓女。妓院封闭后，我才不再受压迫了。经过学习与改造，我变成了新社会的新妇女。妇联代表冯世亮指出：“姊妹们在旧社会下是受尽压迫与痛苦，现在才得到解放，我们只有好好学习好好工作才对。”曲艺界连阔如说：“我们今后要把曲艺工作搞好，应加强教育，首先是教育自己，然后才能教育广大的人民。”最后，魏喜奎、曹宝禄号召曲艺界要准备二十余段新的有关妇女的节目在“三八”国际劳动妇女节演出，以示庆祝。
