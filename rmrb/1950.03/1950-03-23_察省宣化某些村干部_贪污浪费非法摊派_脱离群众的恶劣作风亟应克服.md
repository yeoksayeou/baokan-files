From our newspaper: According to a report in the Chahar Daily on March 14th, serious embezzlement and waste by some village cadres were discovered in the Huashaoying District of Xuanhua County during the land reform. Illegal apportionment by village cadres occurred in twelve villages including Beidazhuangkou. The apportionment of millet in the North and South Dazhuangkou villages alone reached 342 shi and 5 dou. Most of the apportioned grain was embezzled and wasted by the cadres. According to statistics from five villages including Xiguanzhuang, cadres collectively embezzled 607 shi and 3 dou of millet. South and North Dazhuangkou set up kitchens for lavish eating and drinking, greatly increasing the burden on the people. For example, a farmer surnamed Bai in South Dazhuangkou sold his fur coat because he could not pay the grain. The method of embezzlement was to apportion grain based on land, vehicles, and livestock, and to report false accounts. For example, the accounts of Xiguanzhuang included "Tofu jerky eaten by District Cadre Fan Zhengdong," but Fan Zhengdong had never eaten in that village. In addition, some cadres extorted the masses under various pretexts. For example, village chief Zuo Mingzhu and three others in Yiduquan Village, on the pretext that Zuo Dexi had a large gun, extorted two liang of opium, six shi of millet, and four sheep. Village chief Qiao Huaizhen and others in Beidazhuangkou asked for ten jin of naked oat flour and three sheng of millet from relatives from Huaian who came to visit their village; and forced Sun Wencai, who sold dried apricots, to give them fifteen jin of dried apricots. The masses reacted very badly, directly damaging the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses, and the policies could not be well implemented. After the leaders of the district discovered these problems, in addition to sending the main culprits, Yuan Jinliang and others, to the government for legal processing, and dismissing the bad cadres An Decheng, Zuo Mingzhu, and others, they also proposed the following measures for the future: (1) Oppose bureaucracy, and district cadres should regularly conduct in-depth inspections of their work, and solve problems in a timely manner. (2) Regularly conduct education among the masses to raise their awareness and expose illegal elements. (3) Elect village governments and thoroughly reform village organizations. Those with serious circumstances will be dismissed and dealt with according to law. Those with lighter circumstances will be reformed and educated. (4) Launch a prize-giving campaign to establish a good revolutionary work style for cadres and truly become servants of the masses.

　　察省宣化某些村干部
    贪污浪费非法摊派
    脱离群众的恶劣作风亟应克服
    【本报讯】据三月十四日察哈尔日报消息：宣化县化稍营区，在土改中，发现若干村干部严重贪污浪费现象；北大庄科等十二个村庄，发生村干部向群众非法摊派现象。仅南、北大庄科两村摊派小米就达三百四十二市石五斗。摊派的米多被干部贪污浪费。据西官庄等五个村统计：干部集体贪污小米六百○七石三斗。南、北大庄科成立伙房大吃大喝，大大的加重了人民负担。如南大庄科一姓白的农民，无法交粮而卖了皮袄。贪污方法是按地亩、车辆、牲口摊粮，并报假账。如西官庄账上有“区干部范正东吃的豆腐干”，实际上范正东并未在该村吃过饭。此外，有的还借口敲诈群众，如益赌泉村长左明珠等四人，借口左德喜有一支大枪，敲诈大烟二两，小米六石，羊四只。北大庄科村长乔怀珍等，向到他村走亲戚的怀安人要莜面十斤、小米三升；向卖杏干的孙文财逼要杏干十五斤。群众反应很坏，直接损害了党与政府在群众中的威信，而政策也不能很好贯彻。该区领导上发现这些问题后，除将首要分子袁金亮等四人送政府依法处理，将坏干部安德成、左明珠等撤职外，并提出今后措施：（一）反对官僚主义，区干部要经常深入检查工作，发现问题，及时解决。（二）经常向群众进行教育，提高群众觉悟，检举违法分子。（三）选举村政权，彻底改造村组织。对情节严重者撤职法办。较轻者，改造教育。（四）开展评奖运动，树立干部革命的优良作风，真正成为群众的勤务员。
