     Tianjin Public Security Bureau Works Responsibly
    ·Mr. Li Shuyun Writes to Express Gratitude·
    I live in the urban area of Jining City, Shandong Province. Because a debtor, Xu, was in Tianjin, he promised last spring to sell his house to repay the debt. I sent a letter to urge him in October last fall, but the letter was returned because he had sold the house and moved. Our area has suffered from a severe famine, and my family of ten is currently without means of support. After a long period of consideration, I decided in January of this year, with little hope, to write to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation into Xu's whereabouts. On February 8th, I received a reply from the Xinzhuang Police Station in Tianjin, detailing the date and location of Xu's move, as well as the price of his house sale. This is truly something unimaginable in the old society. I then thought that difficulties were multiplying. Although I knew the situation, I was still unable to go to Tianjin to demand repayment. Even if I borrowed money to go, I was afraid that he would resort to trickery and move again. Therefore, I wrote to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau again, requesting them to help recover the debt. On March 4th, I received a notice from the Police and Legal Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau, stating that Xu had been summoned on February 28th and guaranteed to repay the debt by the end of the lunar January. This truly made me feel the government's concern for the people. As the largest commercial port in North China, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, a people's security agency, has a considerable workload. However, even for matters concerning people not under its jurisdiction, it still promptly listened to their requests and properly handled them in a timely manner. This high level of mass perspective and responsible work spirit is worthy of praise and emulation. This allows me to see the new atmosphere of New China and its bright and promising future. Furthermore, this provides a good lesson to lawbreakers: as long as they do something that violates the interests of the people, no matter where they hide, they will not escape the net of the people's law.
      Jining City, Li Shuyun

    ·李书韵君来信表示感谢·
    我住在山东济宁市城区，因天津有一债务人许某，去春应允售出住房清还账款。秋天十月函催，已售房他迁，原信退回。敝处灾荒严重，目前居家十口生活无着，经长时考虑，至本年一月于无望中，决定去信天津公安总局，请求调查许某消息。于二月八日，果然由天津辛庄派出所将许某迁移日期、地点以及其售房价格等详情函复。这真是在旧社会中梦想不到的。我继思困难丛生，虽知其情况，而仍无力赴津索取；即使借贷前往，亦恐其故弄狡狯再行他迁。因之又去函天津公安总局，请求代为催讨。于三月四日接到公安局警法科通知，已于二月二十八日，传讯许某负保于阴历一月底还清。这真使我感到了政府对人民的关心。以华北第一大商港，人民治安机关公安总局事情相当繁重，对于这虽不是其所管地区人民的事，依然及时听取其请求，并及时代为妥善办理。这种高度的群众观念，以及工作负责的精神，是值得表扬与学习的。这使我看到新中国的新气象，与其前途的光明远大。更进一步的，这给予不法分子一很好的教训，只要做了违犯人民群众利益的事，无论躲至何方，亦逃不出人民的法网。
