　　"Extremely Arrogant" - Reading the Newspaper
　　Ling Yan
　　The U.S. State Department issued a "statement" on March 3rd, forbidding the delegation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace (including French painter Picasso, British Deputy Dean of Canterbury Johnson, and ten others) from going to the United States to appeal for peace to the U.S. Congress, to demand disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons. U.S. House Representative and one of the Democratic Party leaders, McCormack, even clamored that the idea of the U.S. Congress accepting peace appeals was "extremely arrogant."

　　Here is a typical example of "extremely arrogant"—a Mr. James Mangan in Chicago, U.S.A., applied to the Illinois Attorney General for registration, demanding to be the owner of the entire sky, including planets and comets; moreover, the Attorney General registered it for him without hesitation, because U.S. law recognizes that whoever first discovers any land, that place can belong to him. He also wrote to the UN Secretariat, requesting permission to speak at the UN General Assembly as a representative of the "Sovereign Space Nation." Naturally, the UN Secretariat was unable to give him a satisfactory answer, so he held a press conference, declaring: "From now on, no one on Earth is allowed to go to the moon or any planet without Mangan's consent! Especially not the Russians." - Only in an arrogant country, under arrogant laws, and in an arrogant atmosphere could such an arrogant "arrogant person" be bred! Dreaming of enslaving the whole world isn't exciting enough, so they dream of putting iron chains on every planet!

　　The arrogant, on the one hand, want to chain all the people of the world to their arms manufacturing machines, working day and night, and on the other hand, they plan to release the tigers that the people have captured with endless suffering, countless lives, and blood, to help them eat people again. MacArthur, who has become the supreme emperor of Japan, has not only sheltered Japanese germ warfare criminals like Hirohito, but now he has decided to release all the Japanese war criminals sentenced to imprisonment and life imprisonment by the Far East Military Tribunal in stages. In order to prepare for a new war and obtain assistants, he disregards the prestige of the Allied Far East Military Tribunal and is hostile to the interests of the people of various countries who have suffered from the Japanese war of aggression; isn't this another instance of "extremely arrogant"? If he thinks he can do it, he might as well dream of calling the soul of Hideki Tojo, who has been executed, back to Tojo's corpse to make him stand up again!

　　There are too many examples of the "extremely arrogant" U.S. officials; they are either crazy or arrogant. Last year, that James named Forrestal went crazy out of fear of peaceful forces and committed suicide by jumping off a building; and now, this James named Mangan is so arrogant that he wants to prevent peaceful ideas from spreading to planets outside the Earth as early as possible. But their partners say that those who ask for peace are "arrogant." - Naturally, in the eyes of people in the madhouse, people outside the madhouse are all madmen.

　　“狂妄极了”——读报随笔——
    凌燕
    美国国务院三月三日发表“声明”，不许世界拥护和平大会代表团（包括法国画家皮加索、英国坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊等十二人）到美国去向美国国会呼吁和平，去要求裁减军备、禁止原子武器。美国众院议员民主党的党魁之一考米克甚至叫嚣着说：要美国国会接受和平呼吁的想法真是“狂妄极了”。
    这里有一个“狂妄极了”的典型——美国芝加哥城有一位叫做杰姆斯·毛根的先生，他向伊里诺州的检查长申请备案，要求作为整天空包括行星、彗星的所有人；而且，检查官毫不迟疑的给他备了案，因为美国法律承认：凡是第一个发现任何土地的人，这地方就可以属于他。他还写信给联合国秘书处，要求准许他以“主权太空国家”代表的身份到联合国大会讲话。自然，联合国秘书处没有能够给他以满意的答复，于是他就举行记者招待会，宣称：“今后地球上不论何人如未得毛根同意，绝对不许到月球或任何星球上去！特别是俄罗斯人。”——狂妄的国度中、狂妄的法律下、狂妄的空气里，才孳生出了如此狂妄的“狂妄家”！奴役全世界的梦做得还不够过瘾，还梦想把铁锁链套上每一个星球！
    狂妄者一方面想把全世界人民都用锁链拴到他们制造军火的大机器上日夜不停的作工，一方面又打算把人民经历无尽辛酸付出无数生命和鲜血才捉住的老虎都放掉帮他们再来吃人。成为日本太上皇的麦克阿瑟，一手庇护了日本细菌战犯裕仁等还不算，现在竟又决定把远东军事法庭已经判处有期徒刑和无期徒刑的日本战犯分期全部释放。为了准备新战争获得助手，不顾盟国远东军事法庭的威信，敌视曾受日本侵略战争的灾祸的各国人民的利益；这不又是“狂妄极了”的一个实例吗？假若他以为他能够做到，他未始不梦想把已处死刑的东条英机的灵魂再唤回东条的尸体上使他重新站立起来吧？
    美国官员们“狂妄极了”的例子是太多了，他们除了发疯，就是狂妄。去年，姓福莱斯特的那位杰姆斯因为害怕和平力量而发疯以至跳楼自杀；而今，这位姓毛根的杰姆斯则狂妄到想要及早阻止和平思想传到地球以外的星球上去。而他们的伙伴却反说要求和平的人“狂妄”。——自然，在疯人院里的人的眼睛里，疯人院以外的人都是疯子。
