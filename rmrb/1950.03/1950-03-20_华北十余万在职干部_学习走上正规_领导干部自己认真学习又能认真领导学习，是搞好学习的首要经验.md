　　More Than 100,000 On-the-Job Cadres in North China
    Study Enters Regular Phase
    Leading Cadres' Own Diligent Study and Competent Leadership of Learning Are the Primary Experiences for Successful Learning

    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Over the past year, on-the-job cadres in various parts of North China have achieved considerable success in their studies and have gained some experience in the process, laying the foundation for further development of the cadre study movement this year.

    Since the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on On-the-Job Cadre Education" at the end of 1948, on-the-job cadres in various parts of North China have been swept up in a wave of learning. Over the past year, according to preliminary statistics from Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces, approximately 69,800 cadres at or above the county level regularly participated in theoretical study, approximately 45,300 cadres participated in spare-time cultural schools, and even more district-level cadres used mutual assistance, self-study, and other methods to conduct cultural study. In terms of study organization, various localities have established formal study systems such as testing and attendance. Cadres in agencies above the county level can also adhere to the system of studying for two hours a day. In the past year, most of the cadres at the county level and above with higher theoretical levels have completed their studies of "A Brief History of Social Development" and "Political Economy," and have initially mastered the basic theoretical knowledge of the laws of social development. Personnel with lower theoretical levels have also completed "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and other books, and have a more systematic understanding of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution. Many of the cadres with lower cultural levels, some of whom were originally illiterate, have been able to recognize three to five hundred characters after cultural study, and some can even write simple letters and work reports. In particular, the scientific and cultural knowledge of cadres who participated in spare-time cultural refresher schools has improved significantly. In addition, in the past year, various localities have combined their studies with new situations and tasks, and have organized the study of Xinhua News Agency editorials such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," urban policies, critiques of the White Paper, "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," People's Political Consultative Conference documents, and other documents, which has also greatly improved the policy level of general cadres, thereby improving their work.

    Over the past year, various agencies have gained some important experience in organizing on-the-job cadre study. The first is the issue of leadership in study. Experience has shown that where leading cadres themselves can study diligently and lead study competently, cadre study is done better. Otherwise, this work cannot be carried out smoothly. Second, appropriately classifying and grouping cadres according to their different levels and learning abilities is an important condition for successful study. In last year's study, some cadres mistakenly regarded participation in study organizations as a political privilege, and had a mentality of aiming too high, demanding to be placed in groups that were beyond their level and ability. As a result, they could not digest or delve into their studies, which made the learning less effective. Third, to ensure that cadres study well, theoretical study must be combined with current affairs and policy study in a planned manner, and the two should be allocated time appropriately and carried out concurrently.

　　华北十余万在职干部
    学习走上正规
    领导干部自己认真学习又能认真领导学习，是搞好学习的首要经验
    【新华社讯】华北各地在职干部学习去年一年来已获得相当成绩，在学习中取得了一些经验，为今年进一步开展干部学习运动打下了基础。
    自一九四八年年底中共中央华北局宣传部发布“关于在职干部教育决定”后，华北各地在职干部均卷入了学习的热潮。去年一年来，据河北、察哈尔、山西、平原四省的初步统计，经常参加理论学习的县级以上干部约有六万九千八百余人，参加业余文化学校学习的干部约有四万五千三百余人，其他采用互助、自修等办法进行文化学习的区级干部则为数更多。在学习组织上，各地均建立了测验、考勤等正规的学习制度。县以上机关干部也能坚持每日学习两小时的制度。去年一年中，县级以上理论水平较高的干部大都学完了《社会发展简史》和《政治经济学》，初步地掌握了社会发展规律的基本理论知识；理论水平较低的人员也学完了《中国革命与中国共产党》等书，对中国社会和中国革命也有了较有系统的认识；文化水平较低的有不少原来是文盲的干部，经过文化学习以后，已能认识三、五百个字，有的甚至能写简单的信件和工作报告。特别是参加业余文化补习学校学习后的干部，他们的科学文化知识更有显著的提高。此外，去年各地的学习中并结合新的形势和任务，有组织地学习新华社社论“将革命进行到底”、城市政策、评白皮书、“论人民民主专政”、人民政协文献等文件，也大大提高了一般干部的政策水平，从而改进了工作。
    一年来各机关在组织在职干部学习中获得了一些重要的经验。首先是学习的领导问题，经验证明，那里的领导干部自己能认真学习又能认真领导学习，那里的干部学习就做得较好。否则，这个工作就无法顺利开展。其次，按照干部不同的水平和学习能力适当地编级分组，这是搞好学习的重要条件。去年的学习中，有的干部曾错误地把参加学习组织看作政治待遇，存在着好高骛远的思想，要求编在为自己的水平和能力所不及的组里，结果在学习中啃不动，钻不进，这样就使学习收效不大。第三，要使干部学习得好，必须将理论学习与时事政策学习有计划地结合起来，两者应该适当地分配时间，兼顾进行。
