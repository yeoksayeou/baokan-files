Workers at the Capital Garment Factory Exclaim:
    "Making Production a Success is an Honor to Meet Chairman Mao!"

    These days, the workers of Garment Factory No. 2 seem particularly active and energetic. Every day they are inquiring about the news of Chairman Mao's return from the Soviet Union, calculating the date of Chairman Mao's arrival in Beijing according to the journey.

    One day during the lunch break, a group of lively young workers happily ran to the trade union office to discuss how they would welcome and celebrate Chairman Mao's return. The reporter was also happy to participate in their conversation and saw the ardent love of the workers of New China for their great leader.

    Wang Deshan, the director of the trade union, first shouted: To welcome Chairman Mao, we must do a good job in production. Only by doing a good job in production will it be an honor to meet Chairman Mao. This time Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union to do such a great thing for the Chinese people, signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and signed two agreements, which have countless benefits for the people. We workers are not just talking about being grateful to Chairman Mao. We must work hard to improve production.

    Young female worker Tong Shuqi said: I feel that this time Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union to sign the new Sino-Soviet treaty, which is of great practical help to our Chinese working class. Imperialism has suffered a major blow. The construction of New China has another layer of guarantee. Our Chinese working class must work harder and use production to thank our Chairman Mao and our Soviet friends.

    Another worker, Qi Xiuying, also rushed to say: In the past, my understanding of Sino-Soviet friendship was not clear. After reading the new Sino-Soviet treaty, I realized more clearly that the Soviet Union is our true good friend. We must thank Chairman Mao for his great contributions to the people and thank the Soviet Union for its help. It is not enough to just hold a celebration meeting. We must work harder to complete and exceed our production tasks, and quickly refuel to support the liberation of Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, and build a new China.

    Female worker Zuo Shuyun said: When Chairman Mao went abroad, the reactionaries at home and abroad spread many rumors, but now Chairman Mao has returned with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and two agreements signed. No one believes the rumors made by the reactionaries at home and abroad. Some people who did not have a clear understanding of the Soviet Union in the past now understand the great friendship and help of the Soviet Union to China. We must learn from the great internationalist spirit of our Soviet friends.

    Cao Zixiang, who never expressed her opinions, spoke this time. She said that last time at the celebration of the founding of the Central People's Government, she squeezed for a long time but failed to see Chairman Mao. This time, she must see Chairman Mao. She said that she is thirty-four years old. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could she have the opportunity to go to the workers' school to study at such an old age.

    At the other end of the office, another worker shouted loudly: Chairman Mao will definitely bring back more revolutionary experience to China when he returns to Beijing this time. Our China doesn't have to worry anymore, and will soon embark on the road to industrialization.

    Wang Deshan, the director of the trade union, gave the reporter a letter to be forwarded to Chairman Mao. The letter said: Dear Chairman Mao: We cheer for your great achievements and celebrate your great achievements. We must stand on our own work posts, under your wise leadership and with the brotherly assistance of the great Soviet Union, give full play to our enthusiasm and creativity, develop our production, and build our democratic, independent, free, happy and fulfilling New China.

### 首都被服厂工人们高呼：“搞好生产，见了毛主席才光荣！”

　　首都被服厂工人们高呼：
    “搞好生产，见了毛主席才光荣！”
    这几天被服二厂的工人特别显得活跃有精神。每天他们都在打听着毛主席从苏联回来的消息，按着路程计算着毛主席到北京的日期。
    一天中午休息的时间，一群活泼的年青工人欢欣地跑到工会办公室里讨论着毛主席回来他们怎么欢迎和庆祝的事情。记者也高兴地参加了他们的谈话，看到了新中国工人对自己伟大领袖的热烈敬爱。
    工会主任王德山首先喊着：要欢迎毛主席，我们就得把生产搞好，只有搞好生产，见了毛主席才光荣。这次毛主席去苏联给咱中国人民办了这样大的好事情，订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，又订了两个协定，对人民有说不尽的好处。我们工人感激毛主席不是空说说就算了的，一定要大家努力把生产搞好。
    年轻的女工佟树琦说：我感到这次毛主席去苏联订了中苏新条约，对我们中国工人阶级的实际帮助是太大了。帝国主义受了一次大的打击。新中国的建设又多了一层保证。我们中国工人阶级一定要加油干活，用生产来感谢我们的毛主席和我们的苏联朋友。
    另一位工人齐秀瑛也抢着说：过去我对中苏友好认识不清。这回看了中苏新条约，更认识清楚了苏联是我们的真正好朋友。我们要感谢毛主席这种对人民的大功劳，感谢苏联对我们的帮助，可不是光开个庆祝会就能完了的。一定更要努力完成和超过我们的生产任务，赶快加油支援解放台湾、西藏、海南岛，建设一个新中国。
    女工左淑云说：毛主席出国时，国内外反动派放了许多谣言，可是现在毛主席订下中苏友好同盟互助条约和两个协定回来了。国内外反动派再造谣也没人相信了。有一些以前对苏联认识不清的人现在也明白了苏联对中国的伟大友谊与帮助了。我们一定要学习苏联朋友的伟大的国际主义精神。
    从来不发表意见的曹紫香这次也说话了，她说上次在庆祝中央人民政府成立的大会上，挤了半天也未能看见毛主席，这回一定要看看毛主席。她说她活了三十四岁了，要不是毛主席，她这么大年纪，可怎么还会有机会又上工人学校去学习。
    在办公室的那一头，另一位工人响亮地喊起来了：毛主席这次回到北京来一定会给咱中国带回了更多的革命经验，咱们中国再不用发愁，很快就要走上工业化的大道。
    工会主任王德山，交给记者一封信转给毛主席，信上说：亲爱的毛主席：我们为您的丰功伟绩来欢呼，为您的丰功伟绩来庆贺。我们要站在我们自己的工作岗位上，在您的英明领导下，在伟大的苏联兄弟般的援助下，发挥我们的积极性与创造性，来发展我们的生产，来建设我们民主、独立、自由幸福美满的新中国。
