　　Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class Enlightens the Consciousness of the Working Class: Great Achievements in the Speaking Bitterness Movement
    Delineating boundaries, consolidating unity, establishing the idea of the worker-peasant alliance; 90% of trainees apply to join the Communist Party.
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class has adopted the method of "speaking bitterness" to conduct historical materialism education for trainees, achieving great results and important experiences. The fourth session of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class, which conducted this education, had a total of 1,300 trainees, all of whom were employees of various public factories and enterprises in Beijing. The main courses of the training class were several basic issues of historical materialism and the Constitution of the Communist Party of China. After five weeks of study, the "speaking bitterness" movement was launched throughout the training class.

    In the process of conducting historical materialism education, the trainees initially studied labor creating the world, class struggle, and Marxist-Leninist theories of the state, further awakening them ideologically. They saw the strength of their working class and consciously broke the shackles imposed on their minds by various idealist and religious superstitious ideas. These idealist and religious superstitious ideas were once prevalent among workers. According to the training class's statistics, out of 1,064 industrial workers, 590 believed in ghosts and gods, and 671 believed in fate. In the study of class struggle and Marxist-Leninist theories of the state, the workers understood the laws of social development from the historical changes of the five modes of production, thus recognizing that the current people's democratic regime in China is led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and recognized the great historical task of the working class in revolution and construction.

    In the process of learning, they naturally realized the exploitation and oppression they had suffered from the reactionary ruling class in the past, thus arousing infinite hatred for imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries as their concentrated manifestation. Thus, the "speaking bitterness" movement was brewing and preparing among the trainees.

    Brewing the "speaking bitterness" meant they were learning to use historical materialism to analyze their life experiences, digging out all kinds of facts about past exploitation, oppression, and insults from the bottom of their hearts, analyzing them from a class perspective, and then telling them to each other in front of everyone.

  Unleashing the Speaking Bitterness Movement After Inner Struggle

    This "speaking bitterness" movement did not break out fully all at once. It was a process of inner struggle. Initially, some people saw others speaking bitterness, but they did not dare to speak, did not want to speak, and felt it was "shameful" to tell. Some people thought: "Suffering is self-inflicted, suffering is very useless, and it is even more useless to speak bitterness after suffering. Why talk about things that have already passed?" At the beginning of the "speaking bitterness," people generally spoke about things that had already passed, and some unimportant bitterness; the most painful and unwilling to say were often selling children, wives and sisters being raped, being insulted, etc., some of which they had never even told their parents or wives. After the mutual enlightenment of the workers, using bitterness to induce bitterness, repeated brewing; from the speaking bitterness of the group, the speaking bitterness of the whole class, it developed into the speaking bitterness of the entire school of 1,300 people, and then back to the class or group to carefully analyze it, and recognize the bitterness spoken at the conference from a class perspective.

    When the "speaking bitterness" reached its climax, the workers broke through all ideological obstacles and poured out the pain in everyone's heart, intertwined into a picture of the entire working class under the exploitation and rule of the enemy, a picture stained with blood and tears. Every worker's hatred converged into the hatred of the entire working class, surging and unstoppable. The workers' "speaking bitterness" mainly focused on the cruel rule and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. According to the training class's statistics on 1,064 industrial workers, under the rule of Japanese imperialism, 1,054 people had been beaten and scolded by Japanese troops, Japanese secret agents, and military police, and their wives and daughters had been raped; 198 people had been subjected to tortures such as being灌凉水 (forced to drink cold water), 压杠子 (pressed with a pole), electric shocks, rolling on a nail board, and sitting on a tiger bench, and being抓去当苦工 (forced into hard labor). Under feudal oppression, 462 of the 1,064 industrial workers had gone bankrupt and fled to the city to work due to the oppression and exploitation of landlords. That is to say, nearly half of our industrial workers were originally peasants who went bankrupt due to the oppression and exploitation of landlords. Bureaucratic capitalism, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, was even more the mortal enemy of the working class. Among the 1,064 industrial workers, 536 people had been beaten and scolded by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, police, military police, secret agents, bureaucrats, home-returning corps, etc., and their wives and daughters had been raped; 244 people had been subjected to various tortures in Chiang Kai-shek's courts, prisons, and military police teams. However, these figures alone are far from fully demonstrating the inhuman lives of the working class under reactionary rule. The political oppression and economic exploitation and plunder inflicted on the working class by the reactionary class enemy were indescribably cruel. In the past, coal miner Hao Zhenguo and his father both worked in the Mentougou coal mine and only received two catties of sorghum per day. His mother starved to death. His younger sister, who was over one year old, was burned to death by the fire, leaving only one small leg and one small arm because no one was taking care of her. The younger sister of female worker Zhao Shulan of the clothing factory was thrown into the river by her mother, who was forced by hunger and cold, and the child stretched out her head and shouted "Mommy" in the river. Wang Shouliang, a worker at the Liulihe Cement Factory, killed a Japanese because the Japanese insulted his wife, but was sentenced to death by the Kuomintang. Such examples are endless.

    From the workers' "speaking bitterness," another side of the workers' lives runs through, which is the workers' persistent struggle against the enemy. Among these struggles, there were strikes and slow-downs led by the underground organizations of the Communist Party of China and spontaneous actions by workers. At the "speaking bitterness" conference, railway worker and Communist Party member Zhao Tongbin told everyone: he and eight other comrades fought against the Japanese invaders under the rule of Japanese imperialism, stole various equipment to assist the anti-Japanese base areas, were arrested by the Japanese invaders, and were subjected to tortures such as electric chairs, pressing with poles, and being bitten by foreign dogs. The enemy also put boiled grass bags on Zhao Tongbin's body, and when they were揭下来 (peeled off), his skin was festering and falling off, but they never yielded, showing the great and staunch spirit of the working class. Finally, some were sent to Japan by the enemy to do hard labor, and continued to struggle; some were released after suffering all kinds of torture, and still insisted on fighting against the enemy.

  Speaking Bitterness Combined with Settling Exploitation Accounts, the Movement Becomes More In-depth and Extensive

    In order to make the "speaking bitterness" movement more widespread and in-depth, the training class adopted a method of combining "speaking bitterness" with settling exploitation accounts. At the beginning, the workers calculated the amount of wages deducted and plundered by the Kuomintang reactionary government and various bureaucratic institutions and speculative merchants before liberation. The amount was astonishing. Only after liberation did the people's government and cooperatives take various measures to protect workers' wages from being affected by price fluctuations and various intermediate exploitations, and to ensure the actual income of workers' wages as much as possible. Zhao Yulin, a worker in the old road team, has the same basic salary now as in the past. His current monthly salary is 352 catties of millet, which can buy five and a half bags of flour. However, when he worked from the 19th year of the Republic of China to the 26th year of the Republic of China, his monthly salary was five yuan, which could only buy two bags of flour. During the eight years of Japanese occupation, his monthly salary was twelve yuan, and during the three years of Kuomintang rule, his monthly salary was thirty-nine yuan, both of which could only buy one bag of flour. However, according to the experience of the training class, after calculating this exploitation account, the trainees should be further taught Marx's theory of surplus value. To make the workers thoroughly understand the truth that labor creates the world and creates wealth. After understanding the theory of surplus value, the workers should be clearly told that the wages of public factories now, although not all of the value created by the workers' labor, they only get a part of it, and the rest belongs to the country led by the working class itself. This is to accumulate funds for their own country and carry out expanded reproduction. For the future happiness of the entire working class and other working people, workers should consciously build a new democratic and even socialist society with the glorious fruits of labor.

    Through the "speaking bitterness" movement, the class consciousness of all workers has been raised, class boundaries have been drawn, and the class unity of workers has been strengthened. The phenomena of mutual incomprehension and disunity caused by different production areas, units, different production conditions, guild gang ideas, and mainly the enemy class's discord, have been completely eliminated after "speaking bitterness". Through the "speaking bitterness" of workers from peasant backgrounds, the workers understand the suffering of the peasants under the exploitation and oppression of feudal landlords, and thus the idea of the worker-peasant alliance is firmly established among the workers.

    Through the "speaking bitterness" movement, the workers generally expressed their gratitude and love for their own political party of the working class—the Communist Party of China. Worker Zhang Tingxun said: "We proletarian working people are like motherless children. Since we have Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party, it is like we have found our own mother. I will always follow the Communist Party." Once the workers recognize the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party and themselves, they urgently demand to join their vanguard. Among the 1,070 workers in the training class, 90% applied to join the Party. After public discussion, the Party committee decided to approve the admission of 334 awakened workers into the Party and held an admission ceremony. It is estimated that in the end, 70% to 80% of the awakened workers can be approved to join the Party.

    Experience tells us that "speaking bitterness" should not be for the sake of "speaking bitterness." After the peasants "speak bitterness," they consciously organize themselves to carry out land reform and eliminate the feudal system. After the soldiers "speak bitterness," they swear revenge in front of the spirits of their relatives who were victimized, and bravely kill the enemy to liberate the suffering people. The workers' "speaking bitterness" is to consolidate the unity of the working class and to fight for the final liberation of the entire working class and the working people, and on the basis of the awakening of the working class, to improve their production enthusiasm and build a new country of the people with their great labor achievements.

　　北京市委干训班启发工人阶级觉悟
    诉苦运动成绩巨大
    划清界线、巩固团结、树立工农联盟思想，百分之九十学员申请加入共产党。
    【本报讯】中共北京市委干部训练班采取诉苦的方法，向学员进行历史唯物主义的教育，获得很大的成绩和重要的经验。进行此项教育的北京市委干训班第四期共有学员一千三百人，都是北京市各公营工厂、企业的职工。训练班的主要课程是历史唯物主义的几个基本问题及中国共产党党章。经过五个星期学习之后，即在整个训练班中展开了诉苦。
    在进行历史唯物主义的教育中，学员们初步学习了劳动创造世界、阶级斗争与马列主义的国家学说，思想上进一步觉醒了。他们看清了自己所属的工人阶级的力量，自觉地起来打破各种唯心论以及宗教迷信思想所加于他们思想上的枷锁。而这些唯心论的、宗教迷信思想，在工人中曾是普遍存在的。根据训练班的统计，在一千零六十四个产业工人中，迷信鬼神的有五百九十人，迷信命运的有六百七十一人。在阶级斗争与马列主义的国家学说的学习中，工人们从历史上五种生产方式的变迁认识了社会发展的规律，因而也就认识了今天中国人民民主的政权是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的，认识了工人阶级在革命和建设中的伟大历史任务。
    在学习的过程中，他们自然而然地觉悟到过去所受反动统治阶级的剥削和压迫，因而激起了对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义及其集中表现的国民党反动派的无穷仇恨。于是在学员中就酝酿着和准备了诉苦运动。
    酝酿诉苦就是他们学习运用历史唯物主义去分析自己一生的经历，把过去所受的剥削、压迫和侮辱的各种事实一件件从心底翻腾出来，用阶级观点加以分析，然后在大家的面前互相诉说出来。
  经过内心斗争展开诉苦运动
    这种诉苦运动并不是一下子就全面爆发的。这是一个内心斗争的过程。最初，有的人看见别人诉苦，而自己不敢诉，不愿诉，嫌说出来“寒伧”。有的人则认为：“受苦是自己找的，受苦就很窝囊人，受了苦还诉苦更窝囊。已经过去的事了说它做什么？”就在开始诉苦的时候，一般地总是先说些早已过去了的苦，说一些不重要的苦；最痛心最不愿意说的苦往往就是卖儿鬻女，妻妹被强奸，自己受侮辱等等，有些甚至对自己的父母妻子都没有说过的。经过工人的互相启发，以苦引苦，反复酝酿；由小组的诉苦，全班的诉苦，发展到一千三百人的全校诉苦，然后再回到班或小组去加以仔细的分析，把大会上所诉的苦从阶级的观点去加以认识。
    当诉苦达到高潮的时候，工人们冲破了一切思想障碍，滔滔不绝地倾诉了每个人内心的痛苦，交织成整个工人阶级在敌人的剥削和统治下一幅血泪斑驳的图景。每一个工人的仇恨，汇合成整个工人阶级的仇恨，汹涌澎湃而不可遏止。工人的诉苦主要集中在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残酷统治与压迫上。根据训练班在一千零六十四个产业工人中所作的统计，在日本帝国主义的统治下，曾被日本军队、日本特务和宪兵打骂、强奸妻女的就有一千零五十四人；受过日本帝国主义灌凉水、压杠子、上电刑、滚钉板、坐老虎凳等酷刑以及被抓去当苦工的有一百九十八人。在封建压迫下，一千零六十四个产业工人中因受地主压迫剥削破产而逃进城市作工的就有四百六十二人。就是说，我们有将近一半的产业工人原是受地主压迫剥削而破产的农民。以蒋介石为首的官僚资本主义更是工人阶级的死敌。在一千零六十四个产业工人中，受过蒋介石的军队、警察、宪兵、特务、官僚、还乡队等等打骂及强奸妻女的就有五百三十六人；在蒋介石的法庭、监狱、宪兵队里受过种种酷刑的有二百四十四人。但是，仅仅这些数字，还远不能完全表明工人阶级在反动统治下所过的非人生活。反动的阶级敌人所加于工人阶级的政治压迫以及经济的剥削掠夺，其情况的惨酷是无法形容的。过去，门头沟煤矿工人郝振国和他的父亲两人做工，每天只得两斤红高粮。母亲活活饿死了。一岁多的小妹妹因无人照管，被火烧得只剩下一条小腿和一条小胳膊。被服厂的女工赵淑兰的小妹妹被饥寒所迫的母亲抛进河里，小孩子在河里还伸出头来喊叫“妈妈”。琉璃河水泥厂工人王守亮，因日本人侮辱他的妻子，他杀死了日本人，反被国民党判成死刑。像这样的例子，是说也说不尽的。
    从工人的诉苦当中，贯穿在工人阶级的生活的另一面，则是工人阶级坚持不懈地和敌人作斗争。在这些斗争当中，有中国共产党地下组织所领导的以及工人自发的罢工、饿工等斗争。在诉苦大会上，铁路工人共产党员赵同斌向大家诉说：他和其他八个同志在日本帝国主义统治下与日寇斗争，偷出各种器材援助抗日根据地，被日寇逮捕，受过坐电椅、压杠子、洋狗咬等酷刑。敌人还把煮开了的草包披到赵同斌身上，揭下来时满身皮肉都溃烂脱落了，但他们始终不屈，表现了工人阶级伟大的坚贞精神。最后有的被敌人送到日本做苦工，仍然继续进行斗争；有的在受尽了各种酷刑之后被释放出来，也仍然坚持和敌人作斗争。
  诉苦与清算剥削账相结合，运动更加深入广泛
    为了使诉苦运动进行得更加广泛和深入，训练班曾采取了诉苦和清算剥削账相结合的办法。开始时，工人们计算在解放以前被国民党反动政府以及各种官僚机构、投机商人所克扣、剥夺去了的工资数额。这个数目是惊人的。只有解放以后，人民政府和合作社才采取了各种方法使工人工资不受物价波动的影响和各种中间剥削，尽可能保证工人工资的实际所得。老道班工人赵玉林，过去和现在都是同样的底薪。他现在每月工资三百五十二斤小米，可买五袋半面。但是他在民国十九年上班至民国二十六年，每月工资五元，只可买两袋面。在日寇八年统治时期他每月工资十二元，在国民党统治的三年期间每月工资三十九元，均仅能买一袋面。但是根据训练班的经验，算这个剥削账之后，还应该进一步使学员懂得马克思关于剩余价值的学说。使工人彻底认识劳动创造世界、创造财富的道理。在懂得剩余价值的学说之后，应当明白告诉工人，现在公营工厂的工资，虽不是工人劳动所创造的价值的全部，他们只获得了其中的一部分，其余一部分则归于工人阶级自己所领导的国家，这是为了自己的国家积累资金，进行扩大再生产。为了整个工人阶级及其他劳动人民将来的幸福，工人应该自觉地以劳动的光辉成果来建立起新民主主义直到社会主义的社会。
    经过诉苦运动，提高了全体工人的阶级觉悟，划清了阶级界线，加强了工人的阶级团结。过去由于不同的生产地区、单位，不同的生产条件，行会帮派思想以及主要是阶级敌人的挑拨离间所造成的互不了解和互不团结的现象，在诉苦以后，就完全消除了。通过农民出身的工人的诉苦，使工人了解在封建地主剥削压迫下的农民的痛苦，因而在工人中巩固地树立了工农联盟的思想。
    经过诉苦运动，工人普遍表现了对工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党的感激和热爱。工人张廷勋说：“我们无产阶级劳动人民像一个无娘的孩子，自从有了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席和共产党，我们好像找到了亲娘一样。我要永远跟着共产党走。”工人一旦认识了共产党和自己血肉相连的关系以后，便迫切要求参加到自己的先锋队里来。在训练班的一千零七十个工人中，即有百分之九十的人申请入党。经过群众公议，由党委决定批准吸收了三百三十四人入党，并举行了入党仪式。估计最后可批准百分之七十至八十的觉悟工人入党。
    经验告诉我们，诉苦不应是为诉苦而诉苦。农民诉苦之后，自觉地组织起来进行土地改革，消灭封建制度。战士诉苦之后，在自己被害的亲人灵前宣誓复仇，为解放受苦受难的人民而英勇杀敌。工人的诉苦则是为了巩固工人阶级的团结以及为了整个工人阶级和劳动人民的最后解放而进行斗争，并在工人阶级觉悟的基础上，提高其生产积极性，以其伟大的劳动成果来建设人民自己的新国家。
