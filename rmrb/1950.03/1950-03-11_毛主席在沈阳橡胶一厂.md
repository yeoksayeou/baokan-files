　　Chairman Mao, who had just returned from handling a great happy event for the people of the whole country, visited the Shenyang Rubber Factory without sparing any effort while passing through Shenyang. During the visit, Chairman Mao shook hands with Li Yannian, a worker operating the vulcanizing machine, and carefully inquired about the method of rubber compounding from worker Sun Yuanqing.

　　As a result, the names of Li Yannian and Sun Yuanqing quickly spread throughout the factories in the Tiexi industrial district. Many factory workers rushed to find Li Yannian and Sun Yuanqing after getting off work. They enviously shook Li Yannian's hand that had been shaken by Chairman Mao and asked him about the scene at the time. Li Yannian said excitedly: "I am so happy! Chairman Mao is truly the leader of our working class! At that time, I saw that my hands were so dirty, and I was still hesitating, but Chairman Mao had already stretched out his hand." Sun Yuanqing also happily said to the workers: "Talking to Chairman Mao is like talking to your own relatives. Even now, I can still remember his kind tone."

　　After seeing Chairman Mao, worker Zhao Guizhi forgot to take her work ticket and ran home to tell her whole family about seeing Chairman Mao with her own eyes. Some veteran technical workers were very moved when they talked about Chairman Mao carefully asking them about each production process. Labor hero Jiang Wanhe did not even eat dinner that day because he did not see Chairman Mao. Later, he said: "Just watch, when we achieve results, we can also go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao."

　　After Chairman Mao left, each workshop in the factory held a forum. Worker Guan Peihua said at the meeting: "Chairman Mao went to the machine, shook hands and talked with us workers intimately. This has never happened in Chinese history." In order to commemorate the glory of Chairman Mao's personal visit, the workers have created a "Production Small Newspaper" published every two days. The workers wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and published it in the inaugural issue of the newspaper. The letter said: "When you left, you said that our factory was doing 'very good, very good'. We must maintain this honor and strive to complete the annual production plan by November this year." [Xinhua News Agency]

　　毛主席在沈阳橡胶一厂
    聂眉初
    才替全国人民办了一件大喜事回来的毛主席，路过沈阳时又不辞辛苦地到沈阳橡胶一厂去参观。毛主席在参观的时候，曾和操纵硫化机的工人李延年握了手，并向工人孙元清细心询问关于配胶的方法。
    于是，李延年和孙元清的名字便很快地传遍了铁西工厂区的各个工厂。好些厂的工友们一下班就赶来找李延年、孙元清。他们羡慕地握着李延年那只被毛主席握过的手，问他当时的情景。李延年很兴奋地说：“我太高兴啦！毛主席真正是咱们工人阶级的领袖！当时我看着自己的手那样的脏，正犹疑着呢，可是毛主席已经把手伸过来了。”孙元清也快乐地向工人们说：“和毛主席讲话就像和自己的亲人谈话一样，直到现在，我还会记得他那和蔼的口气。”
    工友赵贵芝在见到毛主席那天下班后，连工票都忘记拿就跑回家去，把亲眼看到毛主席的事情告诉全家大小。有些老技术工人谈起毛主席细心地向他们询问每个生产过程时，都非常感动。劳动英雄蒋万和因为没有看见毛主席，那天连晚饭都没有吃，后来他说：“瞧着吧，等我们干出成绩来，还可以上北京去见毛主席呢。”
    毛主席走后，厂里的各车间都开了座谈会，工友关佩华在会上说：“毛主席到机器旁边，和我们工人亲密地握手、谈话，这是中国历史上从没有过的事。”工人们为了要纪念毛主席亲临参观的光荣，已创办了一个每两天一期的《生产小报》。工人们写了一封给毛主席的信在小报的创刊号上发表，信里说：“你临走时说我们工厂搞得“很好，很好”，我们一定要保持这个荣誉，争取在今年十一月内完成全年的生产计划。”【新华社】
