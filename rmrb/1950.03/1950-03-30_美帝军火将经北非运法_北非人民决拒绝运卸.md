　　Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: As so-called "military aid" materials have already departed from the United States and are about to arrive in North Africa, the North African people have launched a movement to refuse the unloading of arms.
    
    The first batch of American "military aid" materials consists of forty-six fighter and bomber aircraft allocated to France, loaded onto the French aircraft carrier "Dixmude," which sailed from Norfolk, USA, on March 18. These aircraft are scheduled to be unloaded at the port of Bizerte in French North Africa, and then flown directly to France across the Mediterranean. According to a United Press report on the 17th, a spokesman for the French Embassy in the United States announced: "The reason why the 'Dixmude' does not sail directly to France is to 'avoid possible sabotage by dockworkers.'"
    
    However, according to a TASS report, after the news of the "Dixmude's" departure spread, a mass protest meeting was held in Bizerte on the evening of the 24th. Bizerte port workers have passed a resolution to prevent the unloading of arms and war materials. The refusal movement in the port of Tunis in French North Africa is even more widespread. Dockworkers in the port held a protest strike on the 22nd, and flour mill workers followed suit on the 24th, deciding never to unload American war materials. Peace advocates in Tunis also held a meeting and passed a resolution declaring that Tunisian patriots and democrats will actively support workers who refuse to unload war materials. The "Tunisian Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom" also issued a protest and called on the working people of Tunisia to refuse to unload war materials.
    
    According to the United States Information Service, the second batch of "military aid" materials, consisting of four "Super Fortress" bombers allocated to Britain, left the United States for Britain on the 20th. The ten billion dollars in arms allocated by the United States to the vassal states of the North Atlantic Group under the so-called "Federal Mutual Assistance Act of 1949" have also been concentrated and are awaiting shipment.

　　美帝军火将经北非运法
    北非人民决拒绝运卸
    【新华社二十九日讯】当所谓“军援”物资已自美国启运并即将到达北非之际，北非人民已发动拒卸军火运动。
    美国的第一批“军援”物资是拨与法国的四十六架战斗机与轰炸机，由法国航空母舰“狄克斯姆德”号装载，于三月十八日自美国诺福克港开出。这批飞机预定在法属北非比塞大港起卸，然后越过地中海迳飞法国。据合众社十七日消息，法国驻美大使馆发言人曾宣布：“狄克斯姆德”号所以不直驶法国，是为了要“避免码头工人可能的破坏。”
    但是，据塔斯社报道，当“狄克斯姆德”号开行的消息传出以后，在二十四日晚间，比塞大即召开了抗议的群众大会。比塞大港工人已通过决定，要阻止起卸军火和战争物资。法属北非突尼斯港的拒卸运动更加广泛，该港码头工人于二十二日、面粉工人于二十四日先后举行了抗议罢工，决定决不起卸美国战争物资。突尼斯港和平拥护者并举行大会，通过决议，宣布突尼斯的爱国分子与民主分子，将积极支持拒绝卸运战争物资的工人。突尼斯“争和平与自由战士协会”亦发出抗议，并号召突尼斯劳动人民拒卸战争物资。
    另据美国新闻处讯：“军援”物资第二批，系拨交英国的“超级空中堡垒”轰炸机四架，已于二十日离美飞英。美国根据所谓“一九四九年联邦互助法”而拨付北大西洋集团各仆从国家的十亿美元军火，亦均已集中待运。
