Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 12th: The Workers' Daily reported that the Enterprise Management Committees organized in state-owned and publicly owned enterprises in Northeast China largely exist in name only and urgently need improvement. According to the report, 683 factories and mines in Northeast China have established Factory Management Committees, among which a small number have played a significant role in improving production and management. However, most still exist in name only, and many problems remain to be resolved regarding the attitude of administrative and trade union departments towards the Management Committees and their mutual relationships.

　　A small number of relatively sound Factory Management Committees are represented by the Andong Paper Mill. The Management Committee of this factory has truly become a powerful leadership institution in the factory headed by the factory director. The administrative, trade union, Communist Party branch, and Communist Youth League branch have established close ties through the Management Committee. Major issues in production, such as the New Record Movement, production quotas, the signing of collective contracts, and reward and punishment work, are discussed and decided by the Management Committee before being promoted and implemented. This avoids the problem of various organizations within the factory not communicating with each other and doing their own thing, truly concentrating all efforts on production. In December of last year, the factory's output increased by 13% compared to the quota. The product cost for the entire year was reduced by 14.4 billion Northeast currency. Over the past year, 39 worker cadres have been promoted. At the Heavy Machinery Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the factory director made a self-criticism regarding undemocratic work styles at the Management Committee meeting. The enthusiasm of all employees in the factory was aroused, and more than 80 suggestions for improving production and management were put forward. Similar situations have also occurred in Fushun Vehicle Factory, Changchun Tram Company, Mudanjiang Railway Station, and other units.

　　However, most factories' Management Committees exist in name only. For example, among the institutions under the four salt industry sub-bureaus in Northeast China, 31 Management Committees and employee representative meetings have been established, but only five or six are playing a role, and some of them still have problems of being inconsistent in their work. Among the 114 trade unions directly under the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, 89 factories have established Management Committees, but most also exist in name only. The organization of some Management Committees is not in line with the resolutions made at the Sixth National Labor Congress in 1947. For example, the Harbin Railway Factory Management Committee has 21 members, all of whom are cadres at or above the section chief level. Many factories' Management Committees do not care about the daily interests of the workers. For example, workers in the Fushun Longfeng Mine do not have heating in their homes in winter, and there is half an inch of frost on the walls. Workers raised their concerns to the Management Committee but did not receive timely and serious resolution. Some Management Committees even fail to value the good suggestions of workers regarding production. Workers at the Jilin Locomotive Depot said: "Small opinions are overcome, big opinions have difficulties, and medium-sized opinions are ignored, so we might as well not raise them."

　　The main reason why the Management Committees exist in name only is that the administrative personnel of enterprises have not truly recognized the policy of relying on all workers and staff to run enterprises well and still have a bureaucratic work style. The director of a factory in Shenyang once submitted a plan to the Machinery Bureau to manufacture 200 rock drills without discussing it with the Management Committee, and as a result, even 80 machines were not completed. Another reason is that the trade union has not actively participated in the work of the Management Committee. Some trade union cadres take a bystander's attitude towards the Management Committee, simply holding meetings as a matter of routine. Individual factory trade union cadres even take an opposing attitude towards the administrative side.

　　In order to overcome the above deviations and make cadres at all levels of trade unions aware of the necessity of implementing democratization of factory management, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on the 3rd of this month, instructing the Cultural and Educational Departments of trade unions at all levels to organize the study of the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" published on February 6th, combine it with the specific circumstances of each factory, conduct thorough reviews, so as to assist factory administrative cadres in managing factories better.

### 东北国营公营工厂  管委会大部流于形式  行政工会亟应切实检讨认真改进

　　东北国营公营工厂
    管委会大部流于形式
    行政工会亟应切实检讨认真改进
    【新华社北京十二日电】据此间工人日报报道，东北国营、公营企业所组织的企业管理委员会大部分流于形式，亟应改进。据该报载称：目前东北有六百八十三个厂矿单位成立了工厂管理委员会，其中少数工厂管委会已在改进生产和管理上发挥了显著作用，但大部分仍流于形式，工矿中行政、工会等方面在对管委会的态度和相互间的关系上仍存在许多亟待解决的问题。
    少数较健全的工厂管理委员会可以安东造纸厂为代表。该厂的管委会现已真正成为工厂中以厂长为首的有力的领导机构。该厂的行政、工会、共产党的支部和青年团支部之间，已通过管委会建立了密切的联系。生产中的重大问题如新纪录运动、生产定额、订立集体合同以及奖惩工作等，都由管委会讨论决定后推动执行。这样就避免了厂内各种组织间互不通气自行一套的毛病，真正把一切力量集中在生产方面。去年十二月份该厂产量较定额提高了百分之十三。去年全年产品成本减少了东北币一百四十四亿。一年来并提拔了工人干部三十九名。在鞍山钢铁公司重机厂，经厂长在管委会上对不民主的工作作风作了检讨，全厂职工积极性提高，提出了八十多条有关改进生产和管理工作的意见。类似情形，在抚顺车辆厂、长春电车公司、牡丹江车站等单位中也都发生过。
    但是，大部分工厂的管委会流于形式。如东北四个盐业分局所属机构已建立三十一个管委会和职工代表会，起作用的只有五六个，其中有些在工作上还存在着忽冷忽热的毛病。沈阳市总工会直属的一百十四个工会的工厂中，有八十九个工厂建立了管委会，也是流于形式的居多。有些管委会的组织并与一九四七年第六次全国劳动大会所作的决议不相符合。如哈尔滨铁路工厂管委会有二十一名委员，且都是科长级以上的干部。不少工厂的管委会不关心工人群众的日常利益。如抚顺龙凤矿工人的住房冬天不生火，墙上挂着半寸厚的霜。工人提意见到管委会，未得到及时认真的解决。甚至工人关于生产的好的建议，有些管委会也不予重视。吉林机务段工人说：“小意见叫克服，大意见有困难，不大不小就不理，干脆别提。”
    管委会流于形式的主要原因，是企业行政人员对依靠全体工人职员办好企业的方针没有真正认识，还存在着官僚主义作风。沈市某厂厂长曾不经管委会讨论就向机械局提出制凿岩机二百台的计划，结果八十台也没有完成。另一原因是工会没有主动地积极参加管委会工作，有些工会干部对管委会采取旁观者的态度，照例开会便算完事，个别工厂的工会干部甚至对行政方面采取对立态度。
    为克服上述偏向，使各级工会干部认识实行工厂管理民主化的必要性，东北总工会文教部已于本月三日发出通知，责成各级工会文教部组织学习二月六日北京人民日报《学会管理企业》的社论，结合各厂具体情况，切实检讨，以便协助工厂行政干部，把工厂管理得更好些。
