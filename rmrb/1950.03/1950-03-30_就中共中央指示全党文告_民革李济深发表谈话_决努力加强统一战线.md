Xinhua News Agency, March 29th:

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued the following statement regarding the CPC Central Committee's instructions issued to all party members on March 25th to strengthen unity with democratic figures and the broad masses:

After reading this document, I had the following thoughts:

First, in order to correct the tendencies of closed-doorism and sectarianism in some areas, the CPC Central Committee specifically quoted two important documents by Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong to educate all party members, requiring them to unite millions of activists around themselves, "listen to the opinions of non-Party members, not only to educate non-Party members, but also to learn from non-Party members." This spirit of trusting the masses and being responsible to the masses is the basic spirit of a revolutionary party undertaking historical tasks. We, the democratic parties dedicated to the revolutionary united front, should "look inward" in response to the call of the CPC. Now and in the future, we should make greater efforts than in the past, first examine ourselves, to cooperate with the leadership of the proletariat party, and complete our due tasks in the process of revolutionary construction. Our understanding of theory and practical experience requires more learning from the CPC than the CPC needs to "learn" from us. We can only contribute to the CPC after we first learn from the CPC.

Second, one of the main experiences of the Chinese revolution is the establishment of a revolutionary united front under the leadership of the proletarian party. The expansion and contraction of the united front has become a sign of the advance and retreat of the revolutionary struggle. This can be clearly seen in the various stages of the past 30 years of revolutionary history. Now that the revolution has succeeded, the great and arduous task ahead is to build a new China. In this task, the united front is of even greater importance. The CPC Central Committee has consistently adhered to this correct policy. This instruction is issued to unite non-Party masses more broadly, and its significance lies in further expanding and developing the united front.

Third, our "Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang" should also take this opportunity to conduct a self-examination: Although our comrades have done some small things in inheriting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary traditions and participating in the revolutionary united front, there is no reason to be complacent. Now we should make greater efforts to expand our role to cooperate with and strengthen the united front. Therefore, we cannot have narrow closed-doorism or a petty bourgeois style, considering ourselves as advanced; on the contrary, we must be good at uniting the majority of enlightened and progressive Kuomintang members, sincerely exchanging all opinions that are conducive to the revolution with them, so that they can also contribute their strength to the construction of a new China. This spirit is what we should comprehend from this document of the CPC.

### 就中共中央指示全党文告  民革李济深发表谈话  决努力加强统一战线

　　就中共中央指示全党文告
    民革李济深发表谈话  决努力加强统一战线
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深就中共中央三月二十五日对全体党员发布的加强团结民主人士及广大群众的指示发表谈话如下：
    我读了这个文告以后，发生了下面几点感想：
    一、中共中央为了纠正一部分关门主义与宗派主义的偏向，特别摘引了斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席两个重要文件来教育全体党员，要求他们团结千百万积极分子于自己的周围，“倾听非党员的意见，不仅是要教导非党员，而且要向非党员学习”。这种信赖群众和对群众负责的精神，乃是一个革命政党担当历史任务的基本精神。我们献身于革命统一战线的民主党派，应当对于中共的号召“反求诸己”。我们在现在以及将来应当拿出比过去更大的努力，首先检讨自己，来配合无产阶级政党的领导，在革命建设过程中，完成我们应尽的任务。我们对于理论的认识和实际的经验，需要向中共学习的地方较之中共需要向我们“学习”的地方，不知要多出若干倍。我们唯有首先学习中共，然后才能有所贡献于中共。
    二、中国革命的主要经验之一，乃是在无产阶级政党领导下建成革命的统一战线。统一战线的扩大与缩小成为革命斗争前进与后退的标志。这是在过去三十年革命的历史各阶段中可以清楚见到的。现在革命成功了，此后伟大而艰巨的任务是建设新中国。在这一任务中，统一战线是有更大的重要性的。中共中央一贯坚持这一正确政策。这次发出指示，要更广大地团结非党员群众，其意义就在更扩大更发展统一战线。
    三、我们“民革”也要借此来作一个检讨：我们同志在继承中山先生革命的传统和参加革命统一战线的过程中，虽然尽了一些微末的力量，但丝毫没有可以自满的理由。现在我们应当作更大的努力，扩大我们的作用，来配合及加强统一战线。因此，我们不可以有狭隘的关门主义，小家气的作风，以先进者自居；相反，我们要善于团结多数的开明进步的国民党分子，诚恳地和他们交换一切有利于革命的意见，使他们也能对建设新中国贡献出他们的力量。这种精神是我们从中共这个文告中所应当领会到的。
