　　Fadeyev's Speech:
    We Have Entered an Era Where Peace Can Truly Be Defended
    [Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 21st] TASS reports: Fadeyev, head of the Soviet Peace Committee delegation, delivered a speech at a mass rally for peace in Stockholm on the 18th. He first conveyed the warm greetings of the Soviet Peace Committee to the progressive intellectuals and all upright people of Sweden who support peace, and especially to the ordinary people of Sweden, because they are the mainstay of peace. Fadeyev pointed out: "It is the labor of the ordinary people that lays the foundation for all true culture. It is they, the ordinary people, who first maintain the best national traditions and national independence. And they are now the true advocates of humanity, because most of the privileged figures of our time have abandoned humanity, while humanity has always existed in the hearts of the people, just as sparks exist in flint. Under certain circumstances, this spark will burst out very powerfully. There are many reasons to believe that we are living in such an era." After denouncing the arms race and war propaganda currently being carried out by imperialist countries, Fadeyev pointed out: Never in history has there been a time when it was so necessary to unite the lofty spiritual strength of ordinary people in all countries to resist these decadent, misanthropic war efforts. Fadeyev pointed out that he was proud to be a citizen of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the most powerful and reliable force for peace. After Fadeyev ridiculed the clumsy rumors of imperialist elements that the Soviet Union threatens peace and even threatens countries like Sweden, he listed facts to show that the Soviet Union has strived tirelessly for peace since its birth, and explained that the foundation of the multinational Soviet Union is equality and mutual respect among all nations, large and small. Fadeyev finally emphasized: "We have already entered an era in which the unity of all upright people who defend peace can truly defend peace. Good people, if provoked, can also be terrible. The people of all countries will respond to attempts to launch a new war by severely punishing the war instigators. Let the war instigators remember this."

　　法捷耶夫演说：
    我们已进入真正能够保卫住和平的时代
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：苏联拥护和平委员会代表团团长法捷耶夫，十八日在斯德哥尔摩拥护和平的群众大会上发表演说时，首先对瑞典拥护和平的进步知识分子和一切正直的人民转达苏联拥护和平委员会的热烈敬意，特别向瑞典的普通人民致敬，因为他们正是和平的中流砥柱。法捷耶夫指出：“是普通人民的劳动，奠定了一切真正的文化的基础。是他们普通人民首先保持最优良的民族传统与民族独立。而且他们现在是真正的人道的拥护者，因为我们这个时代大部分的特权人物已弃绝人道，而人道却始终存在于人民的心坎之中，正如火花存在于火石之中一样。在某种情形之下，这火花会非常有力地迸发出来。有许多理由足以使人相信我们正生活在这样的时代里。”法捷耶夫在痛斥帝国主义国家目前正在进行的军备竞赛与战争宣传后指出：历史上从来不曾有一个时期像现在这样需要团结一切国家普通人民的崇高的精神力量，来反抗这些腐朽的、憎恶人类的战争努力。法捷耶夫指出，他以身为苏联的人民而自豪，因为苏联是最强大与最可靠的和平力量。法捷耶夫嘲笑帝国主义分子说苏联威胁和平，也威胁甚至像瑞典这样的国家的拙劣谣言后，历举事实说明苏联自其诞生之日起即为和平而奋斗不懈，说明多民族的苏联的立国基础，就是各大小民族平等与互相尊重。法捷耶夫最后强调指出：“我们业已进入一切保卫和平的正直人们的团结真正能够保卫住和平的时代。善良的人们如果被激怒了，也会是可怕的。各国人民是会用严惩战争贩子的办法来回答发动新战争的企图的。让战争贩子们记住这一点吧。”
