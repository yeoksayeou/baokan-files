[This newspaper’s report from Pingyuan Province on February 26th:] During the winter of 1949, the Puyang Special District of Pingyuan Province caused extremely severe losses to peasants transporting public grain. It has been confirmed that four grain-transporting peasants died, five were injured, more than one hundred draft animals died, and many grain carts were damaged.

Several grain stations were overcrowded with people and animals, lacking water and grass, and sleeping in the frozen wilderness. Grain could not be received in time or was not received at all, resulting in the deaths of four grain-transporting peasants, injuries to five, the deaths of more than one hundred livestock, and considerable damage to carts.

The main reason for these severe losses was the extreme lack of importance attached to the transportation of public grain by the Puyang Special District CCP Committee and the Commissioner's Office. When the Commissioner's Office convened a grain transportation meeting, neither the Prefectural Committee Secretary nor the Commissioner attended; they did not personally lead or specifically organize this work. Consequently, serious chaos occurred during grain transportation. For example, counties required to deliver grain to the Yuancun Grain Station did not proceed according to the original plan. Nanle and Qingfeng counties postponed their grain delivery dates. Puyang County vaguely stipulated that "the allocated amount should be delivered in two batches," and some districts in the county allowed grain-transporting peasants to set off early, even mobilizing all manpower and animal power to rush the transportation. As a result, the receiving stations were filled with vehicles, people and animals were crowded together, and grain could not be weighed in time. Essential supplies for grain transporters, such as fodder stations and hot water stations, were not prepared in advance, causing serious difficulties in the lives of the grain-transporting peasants. Livestock also lacked care. As a result, in Puyang County alone, which delivered grain to the Yuancun Station, two grain-transporting peasants died, and fifty livestock died. The situation at the Daokou Grain Station was also very bad. Initially, the Commissioner's Office only decided that a secretary of the Commissioner's Office would be responsible for leadership, but the secretary privately went home and delegated the task to the warehouse keeper. When a large number of grain-transporting vehicles arrived, no one received the public grain. The grain station had a backlog of as many as 278 carts. The situation at the Chu Wang Grain Station was even worse. After deciding on grain transportation, the Commissioner's Office temporarily decided to build a bridge before transporting grain, but the Commissioner's Office only arranged for the bridge to be built and did not notify them to slow down the grain transportation. The peasants still transported the grain according to the original schedule. Because the grain receiving personnel were completely unprepared, the grain-transporting peasants and livestock were forced to sleep in the frozen wilderness for several days before they could return home. Some grain station cadres disregarded the suffering of the grain-transporting peasants sleeping in the snow and ice and heartlessly "worked according to schedule"!

After such a serious problem occurred, the Puyang Commissioner's Office, the Puyang CCP Committee, and the Grain Company did not deeply reflect on it. Deputy Commissioner Li Lige even said, "Livestock cannot withstand the wind, snow, freezing, and starvation because they lack training." Some people also believed that the reason livestock died was because "selling meat is much more profitable than selling livestock." Some even believed that the owners let their livestock die in order to get high compensation from the government. Although the Pingyuan Provincial Government had conducted an inspection within two months of the above-mentioned incidents, it had not taken appropriate action as of February 26. The North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee has ordered the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the CCP to conduct a swift review and handle the matter and to publish the results publicly in the newspaper.

### 濮阳中共地委及专署忽视运粮工作  运粮中发生混乱现象  农民遭受极严重损失  中共中央华北局令平原省委迅即检讨处理

　　濮阳中共地委及专署忽视运粮工作
    运粮中发生混乱现象  农民遭受极严重损失
    中共中央华北局令平原省委迅即检讨处理
    【本报讯】据本报所得二月二十六日平原省消息称：一九四九年冬季，平原省濮阳专区在运输公粮中，曾使运粮农民遭受了极严重的损失。已查清运粮农民死四人，伤五人，运粮牲畜死亡百余头，运粮大车亦损坏不少。
    几个粮站人畜拥挤，缺水缺草，露宿冰天雪地；粮食不能及时接收或无人接收，以致运粮农民死四人、伤五人，牲畜死百余头，大车损坏不少。
    造成这种严重损失的主要原因，是濮阳专区中共地委及专署对于公粮运输工作极不重视。专署召开运粮会议时，地委、专员均未出席参加，他们更未亲自领导和具体组织这一工作。于是运粮中就发生了严重的混乱现象。例如：按规定须向元村粮站交粮的各县，都未按照原定计划进行。南乐、清丰两县推迟了交粮的时间；濮阳县笼统规定“按布置数字分两批交完”，该县有些区让运粮农民提前起程，甚至动员全部人力畜力抢运。结果收粮站屯满车辆，人畜拥挤，粮食不能及时过秤。运粮人马所需的草料站、开水站等，事先均未准备，致运粮农民的生活，发生严重困难。牲畜亦缺乏照管。结果仅向元村站交粮的濮阳一县运粮农民即死亡二人，牲畜死亡五十头。道口粮站的情形也很坏，最初专署只决定由一专署秘书负责领导，该秘书又私自回家，把任务交给管库员代理。大批运粮车辆到达时，竟无人接收公粮。该粮站曾积压大车二百七十八辆之多。楚旺粮站情形更糟，专署在决定运粮之后，临时决定先架桥后运粮，但专署只布置了架桥，并未通知缓运公粮。农民仍按原定时间把粮食运到。收粮人员因毫无准备，使得运粮农民与牲畜在冰天雪地中露宿数天，始得回家。有些粮站干部不顾运粮农民在冰雪中露宿的痛苦，依然毫无心肝地“按时办公”！
    这样严重的问题发生后，濮阳专署、中共濮阳地委与粮食公司均未深刻反省。而该专署副专员李立格同志竟说：“牲口顶不住风雪冻饿死亡，是牲口缺乏锻炼。”还有人认为牲口所以死亡，是因为“卖肉比卖牲口有利得多”。还有人甚至认为，牲口主让牲口死了，是想得到政府的高价赔偿。上述事件发生后两个月内，平原省府虽已进行过检查，但直到二月二十六日还未进行适当处理。中共中央华北局已令中共平原省委迅速进行检讨处理，并须将结果公开在报上发表。
