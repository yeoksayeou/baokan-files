Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th—The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its fifth administrative meeting on the 1st. At the meeting, Committee Member Wang Ziyi, in response to the situation where most organizations were large and even overlapping, proposed the following principles regarding the organization and staffing of units affiliated with the Military and Political Committee: 1. Based on the urgent needs of current (one quarter or one year) work; 2. Taking into account the number of cadres and economic strength; 3. Adjusting and merging overlapping institutions; 4. Separating administrative and business institutions, and changing business-oriented institutions into enterprises. The meeting unanimously approved the above principles. Chairman Peng Dehuai made a brief speech on staffing and the working style of government personnel. Chairman Peng strictly demanded that the organizational structure and staffing of all departments must be streamlined. It should be implemented practically and step-by-step, according to the needs of the work, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, with plans and steps; do not force next year's work to be done this year, and do not establish institutions now that will only be needed next year. Regarding the issue of work style, Chairman Peng put forward Article 18 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which stipulates that "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must practice a clean, simple, and revolutionary working style of serving the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from the masses of the people," and demanded that every government worker faithfully implement it, and thoroughly investigate the phenomena of extravagance, waste, and even corruption that exist in some departments.

    【新华社西安六日电】西北军政委员会于一日举行第五次行政会议。会上，王子宜委员根据多数机关组织庞大，甚至重叠的情形，提出了关于军政委员会所属各单位的组织机构和人员编制的原则：一、依据目前（一季或一年）工作迫切需要；二、照顾到干部数量和经济力量；三、调整及合并重叠机构；四、行政机关和事业机关分开，把事业性的机关改为企业化。会议一致赞成上述编制原则。彭德怀主席曾就编制及政府人员工作作风等问题作简要讲话。彭主席严格要求各部门的组织机构和人员编制，必须力求精简。应根据工作任务的需要，分别轻重缓急，有计划有步骤地踏踏实实地去实行；不要把明年的工作勉强拿到今年来做，不要把明年才需要的机构在现在来建立。关于工作作风问题，彭主席提出人民政协共同纲领第十八条，“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污、禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风”的规定，要求每个政府工作人员忠实执行，并彻底检查一些部门中存在着的铺张、浪费、甚至贪污的现象。
