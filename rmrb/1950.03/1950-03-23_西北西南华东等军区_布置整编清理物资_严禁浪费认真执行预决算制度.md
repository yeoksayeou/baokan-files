Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The Northwest, Southwest, East China and other military regions of the People's Liberation Army are, according to the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on this issue, arranging reorganization, inventory of materials, and prevention of waste. Some units have already uncovered serious waste and violations of discipline.

The Northwest Military Region and the Front Committee of the First Field Army issued a decision to establish the All-Army Supreme Reorganization Committee and Materials Inventory Committee, with Yan Kuiyao, Chief of Staff of the Military Region and the First Field Army, and Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department, serving as chairmen respectively, responsible for the reorganization and materials inventory work of the entire army. It is also stipulated that reorganization committees and materials inventory committees must be established in agencies above the regimental level to be responsible for counting and verifying the consumption, false reports, and estimated figures of existing personnel, horses, and vehicles in various agencies and units. A detailed list of materials from each unit must be prepared and reported level by level, strictly prohibiting the expansion of establishments and immediately stopping the phenomenon of agencies adding personnel and opening training classes without approval. Existing family members of the troops who have the ability to work should be assigned work as much as possible; those who cannot work should be organized to participate in production. The decision calls on the entire army to conscientiously implement the budget and final accounting system, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, step up production and economization, and ensure that each person completes the task of producing and saving three shi of millet throughout the year.

The Southwest Military Region held a meeting on the 7th of this month, presided over by Deputy Commander Li Da, with the heads of various departments directly under the Military Region, to discuss specific methods for implementing the State Council's decision and the CCP Central Committee's notice. According to the reports of preliminary inspections by various departments, it was found that due to repeated calculations and incorrect estimates, the budget was over-estimated by 80,000 people. Taking the Eastern Sichuan Military Region as an example, the estimated number of defecting troops was more than 40,000 more than the actual number. Two regiments of a certain unit cooperated in combat, and both parties made duplicate budgets. Deputy Commander Li pointed out that verifying the number of personnel in the entire army is the key to implementing the State Council's decision and the Central Military Commission's instructions, implementing reorganization, saving expenses, and overcoming the current national financial difficulties, and must be accurate and error-free. On the basis of verifying the number of people, it is also necessary to examine the establishment and personnel, streamline agencies, and extract unnecessary personnel to strengthen local work. The logistics and communications departments should also consider formulating plans for the implementation of enterprise-ization in the units under their jurisdiction where it should be implemented. The Military Region Headquarters has telegraphed the heads of various armies to personally take charge and conscientiously do a good job in reorganization, counting, and inventory work, which will be checked and reviewed by the Military Region Headquarters.

The logistics departments of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army began to conduct material inventories after the All-Army Logistics Work Conference in January this year, and found a large number of useful materials. Now, according to the instructions of the State Council, they are conducting in-depth inspections and have found that the leadership of some units still has a bureaucratic style, lax and paralyzed administrative management, and there is a lack of organization and discipline in their work. There is a lack of an overall concept of unified, centralized, and strict enforcement of the system. For example, some units have neither accurate statistics nor serious inspections of personnel, horses, weapons, vehicles, ammunition, etc., and there is a perfunctory style of "waiting for instructions and acting accordingly" from top to bottom. Some units have "small treasuries" that are not reported to higher authorities, or they claim more and report less. Individual units have many unnecessary materials that are not turned over to higher authorities, but are allowed to be discarded and damaged. Phenomena such as mold, theft, and loss often occur in warehouses. Recently, a factory of the Ordnance Department produced thousands of signal flare shells that did not meet the standards, causing a great waste of materials. The Motor Vehicle Regiment of the Transportation Department had an incident in which a cadre privately borrowed 8 million yuan of public funds in violation of discipline. A certain transportation office lost 2.5 million yuan of public funds. Many units only shouted the slogan "Love the People's Motherland's Property" in vain, without delving into practical work. The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Logistics Department has issued a call, requiring all personnel in the logistics department, especially financial personnel, to thoroughly examine their work in accordance with the basic spirit of the State Council's decision, overcome and correct the past errors of going their own way, spending money casually, and disregarding the overall situation. Individual serious waste and corruption must be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. Every cadre in the logistics department should take this decision and a series of related documents of the State Council as the central focus of current study. The central task of the logistics department's political work in March is also to fully ensure the implementation of this work and study.

　　西北西南华东等军区
    布置整编清理物资
    严禁浪费认真执行预决算制度
    【新华社二十一日讯】人民解放军西北、西南、华东等军区，正根据中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”和中共中央关于这一问题的指示，布置整编、清理物资、杜绝浪费的工作；有些单位并已查出严重浪费和违犯纪律的现象。
    西北军区暨第一野战军前线委员会发出决定，成立全军最高整编委员会和物资清理委员会，由军区兼第一野战军参谋长阎揆要、政治部主任甘泗淇分别担任主任委员，负责全军整编和物资清理的工作。另规定团以上各级机关，均须成立整编委员会和物资清理委员会，负责点验、核实各机关部队现有人员、马匹和车辆等的消费、虚报和估计的数字，将各单位物资造具清册逐级转报，严禁扩大编制，立即停止各机关不经批准自行添招人员及招开训练班的现象。部队中现有家属有工作能力者，尽量分配工作；不能工作者，组织参加生产。决定中号召全军认真执行预算、决算制度，坚决反对铺张浪费，加紧生产节约，保证每人全年完成生产节约小米三市石的任务。
    西南军区本月七日由副司令员李达主持召开军区直属单位各部首长会议，讨论具体执行政务院决定及中共中央通知的办法。据各部初步检查后汇报的情况，发现因计算重复和估计的不正确，多预算了八万人。以川东军区为例，各部对于起义部队的人数，估计数较实有数多了四万余人。某部两个团配合作战，双方都作了重复的预算。李副司令员指出：核实全军人数是执行政务院决定及中央军委指示，贯彻整编节省开支，渡过目前国家财政困难的关键所在，必须要作到精确无误；在核实人数的基础上，还要审定编制、人员，紧缩机关，抽出不必要的人员加强地方工作；后勤和通讯部门并应考虑所辖各单位中应该实行企业化的就要订出实行的计划。军区司令部已电令各军首长亲自负责，认真作好整编、点验、清查等工作，由军区司令部负责检查和审核。
    华东军区和第三野战军后勤部门，在今年一月全军后勤工作会议后，已开始进行清查物资的工作，查出了大批有用的物资；现在根据政务院的指示进行深入检查，发现若干单位领导方面仍存在着官僚主义作风，行政管理上松懈、麻痹，工作中存在着无组织、无纪律的现象，缺乏统一集中严格执行制度的整体观念。例如有些单位对人员、马匹、武器、车辆、弹药等，既无精确统计，也不认真检查，由上而下存在着“等因奉此”的敷衍作风；有些单位有“小金库”，不向上级报告，或多领少报；个别单位有许多用不着的物资不往上缴，任其抛置损坏；仓库中霉烂、失窃、遗失等现象常有发生；最近军械部某厂造出的数千发信号弹弹壳不合标准，造成很大的物资浪费；运输部汽车团曾发生干部私借公款八百万元的违犯纪律的行为；某运输处丢失公款二百五十万元；许多单位仅空喊“爱护人民祖国财产”口号，没有深入到实际工作中去。后勤部中国共产党委员会已发出号召，要求后勤部门全体人员，特别是财政工作人员，要根据政务院决定的基本精神，来深入检查工作；克服与纠正以往存在的各自为政、随便开支、不顾整体的错误现象；对个别严重浪费、贪污现象，必须彻底追究责任，严予处分。后勤部门的每个干部，要以政务院的这个决定和有关的一系列文件作为目前学习的中心。三月份后勤部政治工作的中心任务也是全力保证这一工作和学习的贯彻。
