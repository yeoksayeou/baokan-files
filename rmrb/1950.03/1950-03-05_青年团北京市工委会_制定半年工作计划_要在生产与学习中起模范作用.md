[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League recently held its fourth plenary meeting to discuss and approve the work plan for the first half of 1950 (before the summer vacation) and changes in the heads of various departments. The plan stipulates the following three basic tasks for this stage:

(1) Because the Youth League is an assistant to the Communist Party and the People's Government, and a reserve force of the Party. The central task of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC in 1950 is to vigorously restore and develop production, and develop cultural, educational, and municipal construction undertakings that serve the working people. The Municipal Committee of the League should, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the League and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, unite the youth and cooperate with the people of the city to give full play to the active role of the youth in completing these tasks.

(2) The League should vigorously strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education of the Youth League members in the process of completing the tasks of Party and government construction. In the year since liberation, it has mainly cooperated with all aspects of the Party and government to carry out extensive political and ideological education for the youth masses, which has achieved great results. Now there are 26,000 League members, and organizations have been established in factories, rural areas, schools, and government agencies. Therefore, internal education must be strengthened in the future, that is, on the one hand, theoretical education and basic knowledge education of the League should be strengthened, and on the other hand, learning should be carried out appropriately in combination with actual struggles. It is necessary to improve the life of the branch, improve the working level and working ability of the branch, so that the active role of the League can be better played.

(3) In addition to strengthening its work among labor youth and intellectual youth, the Youth League should also strengthen its ties with the broad masses of unorganized youth on this basis, and unite them to participate in production and learning. Strengthen the ideological education of the mass line, and further strengthen the connection between the League and the youth masses.

Based on these basic tasks, the following specific tasks are determined:

(1) Youth League members in schools must cooperate with administrative and Party branch student unions to unite teachers and students and study regular courses well (including political courses). They should play a model role, promote students' learning and ideological progress, and reflect opinions on teaching (pay attention to methods). Do a good job in extracurricular production, run cooperatives with emphasis, and improve students' nutrition. Appropriately organize extracurricular recreational and entertainment activities (must limit time, streamline meetings). League members must become models of working together and practicing democracy in the work of the student union.

The Municipal Committee of the League must strengthen contact with the administrative departments of schools, and should cooperate with educational administration to help improve the level of political courses. League members should play an active role in improving the relationship between League members and their families.

(2) Factory Leagues must cooperate with the Party, government, trade unions, and adult workers to play an active role in signing collective contracts, implementing democratic management, and in production competitions to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. Strengthen technical learning (technical learning classes can be held in cooperation with the Party, government, and trade unions, and apprenticeship contracts can be signed), and appropriately promote the formulation of personal technical learning plans for young workers. When the administration calls for and has formulated a production plan, a personal production plan for young workers can be formulated. Strengthen political and cultural learning (actively participate in political learning organized by trade unions and spare-time schools in factories throughout the city), and take care of the immediate concerns of young workers' lives and welfare.

League members should become active members of trade unions. The League must strengthen contact with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Strengthen the leadership of League organizations in private factories. Continue to establish and expand organizations in factories and mines where the League has not been established and where its strength is weak. Strengthen the work of praising and encouraging League members who are active in production.

(3) After the completion of land reform, the work of the League in suburban rural areas is mainly to respond to the Party and government's call for production and strengthen youth's cultural learning. Improve work, strengthen organizational leadership, and give play to the role of the League. Strengthen the Party's leadership and influence among peasant youth.

(4) League members in government agencies must strengthen ideological education and professional study, unite the youth to improve work efficiency, and develop a style of criticism and self-criticism to ensure the completion of administrative work.

(5) Focus on establishing and developing Young Pioneers teams, and study the working methods and roles of the teams. Promote the distribution of "Beijing Young Pioneers."

(6) Focus on holding symposiums or representative meetings of youth from all walks of life. Investigate and study the situation of unorganized youth, and strengthen guidance and contact with unemployed and out-of-school youth. Prepare to suggest that the Preparatory Committee of the Democratic Youth Federation convene a city-wide youth representative conference in the near future to establish the Youth Federation.

(7) Organizational exclusivism has been basically overcome, and the slogan of "actively developing" is generally stopped. Organizational life must promote democracy (trial opening of League member representative meetings with emphasis). Strengthen organization and discipline, establish an appropriate system of rewards and commendations, combined with criticism and self-criticism. Cultivate cadres in a planned way, and strengthen League members' education on Party building.

(8) Vigorously do a good job in League member education and general propaganda and education work. Establish propagandists (branch instructors) to carry out regular round-robin education on basic knowledge of the League and ideological issues of youth (the content of "Beijing Youth" is mainly combined with this work). Regularly hold general youth lectures. Strengthen cultural and artistic activities.

Regarding the work of the Municipal Committee of the League:

(1) The central task is to help the work of the lower-level League committees, and we must "give more and ask for less." In addition to giving the following directions and tasks, we should also give specific methods for completing the tasks, tell them how to avoid or correct deviations, and explain what are the principles and what can be used flexibly. And we must check the work and make a summary. Therefore, it is necessary to change the general call method of work, and when assigning tasks, we must focus on experiments and then promote them. (2) Give play to the role of the organization and clarify the division of labor. (3) Establish a system.

　　青年团北京市工委会
    制定半年工作计划
    要在生产与学习中起模范作用
    【北京讯】中国新民主主义青年团北京市工委会于日前召开第四次全体会议，讨论通过一九五○年上半年（暑假前）工作计划及各部负责人的变动。计划中规定了这一阶段的三项基本任务为：
    （一）因为青年团是共产党与人民政府的助手，是党的后备军。中共北京市委一九五○年的中心任务是大力恢复与发展生产，发展为劳动人民服务的文教事业与市政建设。团市工委应在团中央及中共北京市委领导下，团结青年，配合全市人民在完成这些任务中，发挥青年的积极作用。
    （二）团要在完成党政建设任务中，大力加强青年团员的马列主义教育。解放后一年来，主要是配合党政各方面进行了青年群众的广泛的政治思想教育，收到了很大效果。现在团员已达二万六千，在工厂、农村、学校、机关都已建立了组织。因此今后必须加强团内教育，即是一方面要加强理论教育及团的基本知识教育，另一方面，要适当结合实际斗争进行学习。必须健全支部生活，提高支部工作水平及工作能力，才能更好地发挥团的积极作用。
    （三）青年团除主要应加强在劳动青年与知识青年中进行工作，并应在此基础上加强与广大无组织青年的联系，团结他们参加生产和学习。加强群众路线的思想教育，进一步密切团与青年群众的联系。
    根据这些基本任务，并确定了下列具体工作：
    （一）学校内青年团员须配合行政及党支部学生会，团结师生，学好正课（包括政治课）。应发挥模范作用，推动同学的学习及思想进步，对教学方面反映意见（注意方式）。搞好课余生产，有重点地办好合作社，改善同学营养。适当组织课外康乐文娱活动（须限定时间，精简会议）。团员在学生会的工作中须成为协同大家一起工作与实行民主的模范。
    团市工委须加强与学校行政方面的联系，并应配合教育行政帮助提高政治课水平。团员在改善团员与家庭关系中应起积极作用。
    （二）工厂团须配合党政工会和成年工人在一起，在订立集体合同、实行民主管理以及在提高产量质量减低成本的生产竞赛中起积极作用。加强技术学习（可配合党政工会举办技术学习班及订立师徒合同），并适当推广制订青工个人技术学习计划。在行政号召并已制订生产计划时，则可以订立青工个人生产计划。加强政治文化学习（积极参加工会举办的政治学习及全市各厂的业余学校），照顾青工生活福利等切身问题。
    团员应成为工会的积极会员。团须加强与总工会的联系。
    加强私营工厂团的领导。在没有建团及力量薄弱的厂矿，继续建立与扩大组织。加强对生产积极团员的表扬鼓励的工作。
    （三）郊区农村团的工作，在土改完成后，主要是响应党政的生产号召与加强青年文化学习。健全工作，加强组织领导，发挥团的作用。加强党在农民青年中的领导与影响。
    （四）机关团员须加强思想教育与业务学习，团结青年提高工作效率，发展批评与自我批评的作风，以保证行政工作完成。
    （五）有重点建立与发展少年儿童队，研究队的工作方式与作用。推广“北京少年儿童”的发行。
    （六）有重点地召开各界青年座谈会或代表会。调查研究无组织青年情况，加强对失业失学青年的指导与联系。准备建议民主青联筹委会在较近时期内召开全市青年代表大会，成立青联。
    （七）组织上关门主义已基本克服，一般停止提“积极发展”的口号。组织生活须发扬民主（有重点试开团员代表会议）。加强组织性纪律性，建立适当的奖励与表扬制度，结合批评与自我批评。有计划地培养干部，加强团员关于党的建设教育。
    （八）大力搞好团员教育及一般宣教工作。建立宣传员（支部教员），进行经常轮回的团内基本知识及青年思想问题的教育（“北京青年”内容主要与这一工作结合）。经常举办一般的青年讲座。加强文化艺术活动。
    关于团市工委机关工作，决定：
    （一）中心任务为帮助下级团委工作，须“多给少要”。除了给下面以方针任务，还应给以完成任务的具体办法，告以如何避免或纠正偏向，说明那些是原则，那些可以灵活运用。并须检查工作做出总结。因此，须改变一般号召的工作方式，在布置任务时须以重点试验，然后再推广。（二）发挥组织的作用，明确分工。（三）建立制度。
