　　State-owned enterprises in Northeast China have undergone significant changes in their production landscape after this New Production Record campaign. First and foremost, the most prominent feature is the continuous emergence of a large number of advanced producers, which has further stimulated the production enthusiasm of all workers and staff. Currently, among the more than 170 major factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry, over 50,000 new record creators have emerged, the vast majority of whom have close ties with the working masses and are leaders in overcoming difficulties in production. Some factories and mines also organize these advanced producers through forms such as employee representative meetings, workshop production meetings, and advanced producer meetings, making them the backbone of production and ensuring the regular improvement of labor productivity. The technical conservatism and guild mentality that previously existed among the employees of various factories and mines have also been greatly reduced, and the phenomenon of some backward elements ridiculing progressive elements has almost disappeared. The coordination of administration, Communist Party organizations, trade unions, and New Democratic Youth League work in various factories and mines has also become further closer as a result.

　　Breaking Outdated Technical Standards
　　Promoting New Quota Work

　　Secondly, due to the continuous deepening of the New Production Record campaign, many shortcomings exposed in the production organization and management systems of various enterprises have also been improved. This mainly involves breaking outdated technical standards and promoting new quota work. The rational resolution of this issue is a fundamental key to improving production. In the past, general technical quotas were generally based on the puppet Manchukuo level and so-called "theoretical standards," but most factories and mines had no idea of the actual production capacity at present. The development of the New Record campaign has enabled factories and mines to find a correct quota theory of "being between the new records created by advanced workers and the naturally existing technical standards, and being achievable by ordinary employees under normal and active conditions," and gradually determined the main and secondary quotas. According to statistics from 116 factories and mines, 36 of them have fully implemented new quotas, 16 have partially implemented new quotas, and the remaining factories and mines will initially complete basic quota work before the end of March. Many factories and mines have also appropriately changed their original wage systems due to the establishment of new quotas. For example, the Andong Paper Mill has implemented an excess reward system, the Shiyan Paper Mill has implemented a seven-level wage system, and the Hegang Coal Mine has implemented a piece-rate bonus system, which are generally more reasonable.

　　Improving Production Organization
　　Giving Full Play to Effectiveness

　　Many factories and mines that were previously affected by chaotic production organization have also been continuously adjusted in this campaign. For example, after the Hegang Coal Mine changed from a decentralized production method to a centralized production method, both machinery and labor were fully utilized, and the tunneling efficiency was four times higher than before. The Jixi Coal Mine adopted a collective shift system at the pit entrance, which greatly reduced the number of absences. Production reward systems and finished product inspection systems, which were previously lacking in various factories and mines, have now been generally established. While improving the above systems and organization, many management cadres of enterprises have also learned how to fully utilize equipment, how to eliminate the phenomenon of waiting for work and materials, and how to cooperate with relevant departments, which is of great significance to the entire economic construction.

　　Overcoming Various Difficulties
　　Continuing to Promote the Movement

　　The great initiative of creating a New Production Record campaign by workers in Northeast China is gradually advancing by overcoming all kinds of difficulties. Before July of last year, there were two basic situations in state-owned enterprises throughout Northeast China: one was that although most factories and mines had resumed work, labor productivity was generally very low; the other was that due to the unfamiliarity of most cadres with enterprise management, serious waste was caused. Therefore, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government decided in July to launch a mass anti-waste campaign to implement the economic accounting system. The Third Machinery Factory of the Machinery Administration saw the emergence of advanced workers led by Zhao Guoyou and others in this campaign, who created new records of increasing production efficiency by more than five times. This event attracted the attention of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast People's Government. Therefore, the "Create New Production Record Campaign" was affirmed as the best form to continue the anti-waste struggle, and it was decided to organize a high tide of economic construction through this. However, this movement encountered various obstacles from the very beginning. On the one hand, there was ideological resistance from some cadres, technicians, and workers, such as thinking that "production is abnormal" and "the organization is not sound" and that new production records could not be developed. On the other hand, there were deviations caused by some leaders who did not grasp the movement well, such as creating new records apart from production tasks and only paying attention to quantity but not quality. After the launch of the campaign, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, in addition to constantly preventing and correcting the above shortcomings and deviations, also adopted the method of signing contact contracts after carefully studying the unbalanced development of the movement in various places, mainly the phenomenon of mutual disconnections between various production processes, in order to overcome this and ensure the completion of the overall production tasks; at the same time, it also promptly raised the issues of changes in production organization and management systems, the utilization of institutions and equipment, wages and quotas, and the supply of raw materials, which are closely related to the movement, and required cadres at all levels to solve them effectively, thus ensuring the continued advancement of the movement.

　　At present, the Create New Production Record campaign is roughly forming three types: The first type is factories and mines where the movement is relatively in-depth and sound, such as Andong Paper Mill, Hegang Coal Mine, Shenyang Weaving Factory, Benxi Cement Plant, etc., where workers, technicians, staff, and leading cadres have been involved in the movement, from the increase of labor intensity to the improvement of technology, the quality and quantity of products are valued, and thus the monthly output of finished products is rapidly increasing. However, the number of these factories and mines is still not large. The second type is that although the development of the movement is still unbalanced, it has also achieved great results, such as further strengthening leadership, which can make the movement healthier. At present, there are the most factories and mines of this kind. The third type is that the movement has not been well launched or has been launched but is progressing slowly, and there are more shortcomings. At present, this type of factory and mine is a minority.

　　From Increasing Labor Intensity Primarily
　　To a Variety of New Records

　　As far as the nature of the new records that have been created is concerned, the number of new records for increasing labor intensity is the largest, followed by improving technical operations, and production safety and inventions are the least. As far as the number of people creating new records is concerned, the proportion of workers is the largest, and the number of technical management personnel is relatively small. Although the development trend of the entire record-breaking movement has always been in an unbalanced state, it has shown that: from individual new records to collective new records, from simply workers creating new records, to gradually including more technical management personnel in creating new records, from new records mainly focused on increasing labor intensity to a variety of new records.

　　Since late December of last year, the number of new records that have appeared in various places has decreased relatively, which is a manifestation of the deepening of the movement. Because from this period onwards, it is much more difficult to create a variety of new records with greater value than to create new records that increase labor intensity. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry pointed out that the future New Record campaign should consolidate and maintain existing gains on the basis of the widespread establishment of new labor attitudes among the working masses, and lead this movement in a more planned and step-by-step manner, so that the quality, quantity, raw material consumption, safety, equipment utilization, and all other aspects of various products can exceed the puppet Manchukuo standards and be maintained regularly. In the current period, the center of factory and mine production management work is to universally establish and strengthen the production responsibility system and determine all or major technical quotas through the New Record campaign to solve the problems of unclear responsibilities and lack of strict plans that are widespread in industrial management.

　　五个月创新纪录近二万件  涌现先进生产者五万余名
    东北的国营企业经过这次生产新纪录运动以后，生产面貌起了重大的变化。首先，最显著的特点是大批先进生产者的不断涌现，推动了全体工人职员进一步发挥生产积极性。目前工业部所属一百七十多个比较主要的厂矿内已涌现的五万余名新纪录创造者，绝大部分是和工人群众有密切联系的，他们在生产中都是克服困难的带头者。有些厂矿并通过职工代表会、车间生产会议、先进生产者会议等形式，将这些先进生产者加以组织，使他们成为生产中的骨干，保证了劳动生产率的经常提高。各厂矿职工中过去所存在的技术保守观念与行会观点也大大减少，某些落后分子讽刺进步分子的现象几已绝迹。各厂矿中行政、共产党组织、工会和新民主主义青年团工作的配合亦因此进一步密切起来。
    打破陈旧技术标准
    推进新的定额工作
    其次，由于生产新纪录运动的不断深入，各该企业在生产组织和管理制度上暴露出的缺点，也有许多得到了改进。这主要是打破了陈旧的技术标准，推进了新的定额工作。这一问题的合理解决是提高生产的基本关键。过去一般的技术定额，普遍是以伪满水平和所谓“理论标准”作依据，但对于目前实际的生产能力，大部厂矿都是心中无数。新纪录运动的开展，使各厂矿找到了“介乎先进者所创造的新纪录与现在自然存在的技术标准之间，而为一般职工在正常积极条件下所能达到的”这一正确的定额理论，逐步确定了主要与次要的定额。根据最近一百一十六个厂矿统计，其中已全部实行新的定额的即有三十六个，部分实行新的定额的有十六个，其余各厂矿也将于三月底前初步完成基本定额工作。不少厂矿，由于新的定额的确定，还适当地改变了原有的工资制度。如安东造纸厂实行了超额奖励制，石砚造纸厂实行了七级工资制，鹤岗煤矿实行了计件超奖制等，一般也都比较合理。
    改进生产组织
    充分发挥效能
    过去曾因生产组织混乱而影响生产的许多厂矿，在这次运动中，也不断做了调整。如鹤岗煤矿由分散的生产方法改变为集中的生产方法后，使机械和劳动力都得到充分的发挥，掘进效能比前提高四倍。鸡西煤矿采用了坑口集体上下班制度，欠勤人数亦大为减少。以前各厂矿所缺少的生产奖励制度、成品检查制度等，现在都已普遍建立。与改进上述制度和组织同时，许多企业的管理干部还学到了如何充分运用设备，如何消除等工待料现象及如何与各有关部门配合工作等的办法和经验，这对整个经济建设具有极重要的意义。
    排除各种困难
    继续推进运动
    创造生产新纪录运动这一东北工人的伟大创举，是在排除种种困难中逐步前进的。去年七月以前，整个东北的国营企业曾经存在着两种基本情况：一是大部分厂矿虽已复工，可是劳动生产率普遍很低；一是由于大多数干部不熟悉企业管理，造成严重的浪费。因此东北人民政府工业部曾于七月间决定了开展群众性的反浪费运动，以贯彻经济核算制。机械管理局第三机械厂在这个运动中出现了以赵国有等为首的先进工人，创造了提高生产效率五倍以上的新纪录。这一事件，引起了中共中央东北局和东北人民政府的重视。于是“创造生产新纪录运动”便被肯定为继续反浪费斗争的最好形式，并决定以此来组织一个经济建设的高潮。可是这个运动从一开始即遇到各种阻碍。一方面是某些干部、技术人员和工人的思想抵抗，如认为“生产不正常”、“机构不健全”不能开展生产新纪录等。另一方面则是由于某些领导人员对运动掌握不好所产生的偏向，如脱离了生产任务来创造新纪录，只顾数量不注意质量等。东北人民政府工业部与东北总工会在运动开展后，除了不断防止和纠正以上这些缺点和偏向外，对于各地运动发展的不平衡现象，主要是各生产工序之间发生互不衔接的现象，也在经过认真研究后，采取了订立联系合同的办法加以克服，以保证总的生产任务的完成；同时更及时提出了与运动有密切关联的生产组织与管理制度的改变问题、机构与设备的运用问题、工资与定额问题、原材料的供应问题等，要求各级干部予以切实解决，这样就保证了运动的继续前进。
    目前创造生产新纪录运动大致形成三种类型：第一种是运动比较深入和健全的厂矿，如安东造纸厂、鹤岗煤矿、沈阳织布厂、本溪水泥厂等，那里的工人、技术人员、职员和领导干部都已卷入运动之中，由劳动强度的提高进到技术的改进，产品的质量和数量都被重视，因而每月的成品量迅速增加。但这些厂矿为数仍然不大。第二种是运动的发展虽然尚不平衡，但也获得了很大的成绩，如进一步加强领导，即可使运动走向健全。目前这种厂矿最多。第三种是运动还未很好发动或即已发动而进程很慢，缺点也较多。这种厂矿目前是少数。
    从提高劳动强度为主
    转为多种多样新纪录
    如从已创造的新纪录的性质看，则以提高劳动强度的新纪录为数最多，改进技术操作等次之，生产保安及创造发明等最少。如从创造新纪录的人数看，以工人的比例最大，技术管理人员为数较少。整个创纪录运动的发展趋势，虽然一直处在不平衡的状态之中，但却显示了：从个别的新纪录逐渐向集体的新纪录方面发展，从单纯的工人创造新纪录，逐渐向包括更多技术管理人员的新纪录方面发展，从提高劳动强度为主的新纪录逐渐向多种多样的新纪录方面发展。
    从去年十二月下旬以后，各地所出现的新纪录的数量相对减少，这是运动走向深入的表现。因为从这个时期开始，要求创造价值更大的多种新纪录，是比创造提高劳动强度的新纪录困难得多。所以工业部指出：今后的新纪录运动，应在工人群众普遍建立了新的劳动态度的基础上，来巩固和保持已有的收获，并更有计划更有步骤地领导这一运动，使各种产品的质量、数量、原材料消耗、安全、设备运用等一切方面，都能超过伪满标准，并保持经常。在目前时期，则厂矿生产管理工作的中心是通过新纪录运动，普遍建立和加强生产责任制，确定全部或主要的技术定额，来解决现在工业管理中普遍存在的责任不明和缺乏严密计划等问题。
