Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 15th: The People's Liberation Army's bandit suppression troops in southwestern Gansu and eastern Qinghai have vigorously launched work to clear out bandits. Over the past four months, the bandits in the aforementioned areas have been basically eliminated or defeated. It is expected that the remaining bandits will be completely wiped out before the spring plowing. According to preliminary statistics, from October of last year to January of this year, our suppression troops annihilated more than 11,600 bandits in total, and killed several Qinghai bandit leaders such as Ma Ying and Han Hairu. Twenty-five Gansu bandit leaders, including Gao Shan, Ma Ba Wa, and Ma Xueliang, expressed remorse and have successively led their remaining bandit forces to surrender. Since mid-September last year, when our main forces advanced into the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and the Ningxia area, the remnants of the Hu Ma bandit troops and local habitual bandits in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia colluded with feudal forces and roamed around, which was quite rampant. The Ma Ying bandit force even once invaded Huangzhong and Menyuan in eastern Qinghai. At the beginning of our suppression work, due to insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the bandit situation, there was a general sense of underestimation and麻痹, thinking that "Hu Zongnan, Ma Bufang's hundreds of thousands of troops have been wiped out, what are these few bandits?" In addition, some soldiers held shrinking viewpoints, thinking that "it is not worth being killed for suppressing bandits after the revolution has been won." Therefore, the troops did not carefully study the characteristics of the bandit situation and the rules of bandit activities, and lacked sufficient preparation before the bandit suppression battles. In addition, some mistakes occurred in the implementation of ethnic policies, so no major blows were dealt to the bandits. After October of last year, the suppression troops thoroughly carried out ideological mobilization and earnestly studied the bandit suppression policy of combining suppression and appeasement and ethnic policies. Starting from December last year, our suppression troops vigorously carried out mass work, publicized the policies of the People's Government, exposed the shameless rumors of special agents, and implemented the policy of combining military and political affairs and combining suppression and appeasement in the process of suppression, so that the roaming bandits in various places were finally annihilated, and the stubborn bandit leaders were isolated. The main reasons for our bandit suppression troops to achieve the above major victories are: First, every battle must be prepared. After the troops have thoroughly clarified the bandit situation, they immediately dispatch troops in several directions, launching a sudden attack and giving the bandits no chance to breathe. At the same time, we adopted steps such as suppressing first and then appeasing, appeasing first and then suppressing, and suppressing and appeasing at the same time to disintegrate the bandit masses and force the remaining bandits to surrender to us. Second, in areas where bandit activities are rampant and where Hui and Han ethnic groups live together, the bandit suppression troops immediately launched mass work after the battle,慰问 and rescued the affected people, and mediated disputes between the Hui and Han ethnic groups, so that the Hui people understood that the Liberation Army is not an army of one ethnic group, but an army of all ethnic groups. Through these publicity efforts, we enhanced the people's class consciousness, so that the people of all ethnic groups actively assisted our army in eliminating the remaining bandits. Third, we resolutely implemented the policy of ethnic unity, using examples to cooperate with policies to carry out publicity. When suppressing bandits, we strictly distinguished between bandits among the Hui people and the Hui people; at the same time, we earnestly educated the Han people to overcome the thinking of 大汉族主义; for the Hui people who did not understand our policies and attached themselves to the bandits, we tried to win them over to return home for production through various social relationships. At present, the revolutionary order in southwestern Gansu and eastern Qinghai has been rapidly established, and the residents who fled in the past to avoid banditry have returned to their hometowns to prepare for spring plowing.

　　甘肃西南部青海东部
    团结人民剿灭土匪  革命秩序迅速建立
    贯彻剿抚兼施方针与民族政策
    【新华社兰州十五日电】人民解放军第一野战军剿匪部队在甘肃西南部及青海东部大力展开清剿土匪工作，四个月来已将上述地区股匪基本上消灭或击溃。残留股匪预期在春耕前即将彻底肃清。据初步统计，去年十月至今年一月我进剿部队共歼灭土匪一万一千六百余名，击毙清海匪首马英、韩海如等多名。甘肃股匪头子高山、马八娃、马学良等二十五人，表示悔过，已先后率领残余匪部投降。自去年九月中旬我军主力分别挺进甘肃河西走廊及宁夏地区时、甘肃、青海、宁夏残留的胡马匪军与地方惯匪、封建势力相勾结，四处流窜，颇为猖獗。股匪马英部并一度侵陷青海东部湟中、门源等地。我进剿部队在展开剿匪工作之初，由于对匪情严重性认识不足，普遍存在着轻敌麻痹思想，以为“胡宗南、马步芳几十万军队都被消灭了，这几个土匪算得了什么”。另外，在部分战士中则存在着畏缩观点，认为“革命胜利了为剿匪被打死不值得”：因而部队没有好好研究匪情特点及土匪活动规律，在剿匪战斗前缺乏充分准备，加之在执行民族政策时亦发生了若干错误，以致未能予股匪重大打击。去年十月以后，各进剿部队深入地进行了思想动员，并认真学习剿抚兼施的剿匪政策和民族政策等。从去年十二月开始，我进剿部队即大力开展群众工作，宣传人民政府各项政策，揭露特务无耻谣言，在进剿过程中则实行军政结合、剿抚兼施的方针，使各地流窜股匪终于相继就歼，顽固匪首陷于孤立。我剿匪部队取得上述重大胜利的主要原因是：一、每战必有准备，部队在确实弄清匪情后立即数路出动，突然合击，不予匪以喘息机会。同时并采取先剿后抚、先抚后剿、边剿边抚等步骤，瓦解匪众，并迫使残匪向我投降。二、在土匪活动猖獗和回汉民族杂居的地区，剿匪部队在战斗后立即展开群众工作，慰问、救济受灾人民，调解回汉民族纠纷，使回民了解到解放军不是那一个民族的军队、而是各族人民自己的军队，通过这些宣传工作来提高群众阶级觉悟，从而使各族人民主动协助我军肃清残匪。三、坚决执行了民族团结政策，用实例配合政策进行宣传，在剿匪时，严格将回族中之土匪与回民加以区别；同时认真教育汉民克服大汉族主义的思想；对不了解我政策附匪的回民通过各种社会关系，争取其回家生产。现甘肃西南部及青海东部地区的革命秩序已迅速建立，过去为避免匪患逃亡的居民纷纷返乡准备春耕。
