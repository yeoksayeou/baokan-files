　　Celebrating the Conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty
    Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Massively Recruits Members
    [Beijing News] The Beijing branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, responding to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters' suggestion to massively recruit members during the celebration and promotion activities of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty, has decided to strive to recruit 50,000 new members in March. The main target of this development is workers, as the association's development among workers in the past has not been widespread. After the announcement of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty, the association has widely carried out various celebration and promotion activities. In March, it further printed propaganda outlines such as "Understanding Sino-Soviet Friendship" and "Introduction to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," combined with the work of issuing membership cards, to carry out widespread publicity. In addition, it organized regular lecture meetings, held weekly from this week onwards, with responsible cadres from each branch or representatives participating in the lectures, and then printed and distributed the lecture drafts to members for study and discussion. Through these publicity and educational activities, the association consolidates existing organizations on the one hand and massively develops new members on the other. The association has also contacted the trade union to assist in the work of recruiting members.

　　庆祝中苏缔结新条约
    京市中苏友协大量发展会员
    【北京讯】中苏友好协会北京分会，响应中苏友好协会总会在中苏新约庆祝宣传活动中大量发展会员的建议，决定于三月份争取发展五万新会员。此次发展对象主要是工人，因该会过去在工人中的发展尚不普遍。该会于中苏新约公布后，即已广泛开展了各种庆祝宣传活动，三月份更印发了“对中苏友好的认识”及“中苏友好协会介绍”宣传提纲，结合发会员证的工作，普遍宣传。此外，又组织了定期讲演会，自本周起每周举行，由各支会负责干部或派代表参加听讲，事后再将讲演稿印发会员，进行学习讨论。通过这些宣传教育活动，一面巩固既有组织，一面大量发展新会员。该会并已与工会取得联系，协助发展会员工作。
