　　Prepare for Pest Control
　　Xi Fengzhou

　　Over the years, agricultural production has suffered significant losses due to the continuous occurrence of various insect pests. Therefore, the masses in various regions are very eager to eradicate pests. The main types of insect pests that occurred last year included locusts, aphids, armyworms, rice stem borers, mole crickets, red spiders, and cutworms. The affected areas not only spread to North China, East China, and Central South China, but also saw considerable pest outbreaks in parts of Northeast and Northwest China. Now that the "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects) solar term has passed, various insect pests will gradually emerge. How to prepare for pest control and prevent reduced yields in leadership becomes a major task. To do a good job in pest control, prevention should be carried out before the pests occur. Past experience tells us that those areas that are prepared for pest control beforehand can prevent or reduce pest disasters. In particular, neglect regarding locusts, aphids, and armyworms can lead to significant losses.

　　Areas that experienced pest infestations last year are likely to experience them again this year. Insect pest inspection work should be carried out in a timely manner to inform local people to prepare actively, be vigilant, and organize manpower in a planned way to carry out tasks such as digging up eggs, collecting eggs, digging up pupae, and killing larvae.

　　Wasteland is also a breeding ground for pests. To eliminate pests, it is necessary to clear weeds and eliminate wasteland. Last year, many soil locusts occurred in some areas of North China. According to research results, locusts are particularly numerous in grassy beaches, mountain slopes, graveyards, field edges, ditches, and land borders, all because of the abundance of grass. For example, in the Bohai area of Shandong, the Yellow River flooded area of Henan, and the Pingyuan-Huxi area, there is a lot of wasteland, and the pest infestation is quite serious. As the saying goes, "More grass turns into insect nests," which is exactly the case.

　　Although chemical pesticides and equipment can be fully utilized for pest control, these items are expensive and in short supply, and cannot solve the basic problem of pest control at present. Therefore, it is very important to absorb the local methods and experiences of pest control from various regions. In fact, in many areas, the masses have created many valuable pest control experiences during the pest control movement. These experiences need to be promoted.

　　It is necessary to strengthen pest control leadership and pest control technology research. In the origin of locusts or severely affected areas with perennial pest infestations, insect pest investigation and research should be carried out according to the actual local conditions, and preparations for pest control should be completed. Before and after the occurrence of insect pests, an intelligence network should be organized to grasp the occurrence of insect pests, observe the occurrence patterns and characteristics of insect pests according to different regions and seasons, and prepare to find the weaknesses of insect pests in order to achieve the purpose of prevention and control. In the past, the pest control headquarters established in various regions played a great role in the pest control movement. This year, in the pest-affected areas, such temporary pest control institutions should be restored and established according to the needs of pest control work, so as to be responsible for organizing mobilization work and leading the masses to carry out pest control struggles when pest infestations arrive. Because large-scale pest control work is a mass movement, it is necessary to rely on the power of the broad masses, organize them, and complete pest control preparations and carry out pest extermination work.

　　Pest control work should not only pay attention to organizational leadership, but also carry out necessary scientific and technical guidance and summarize mass pest control experience, so that pest control science and technology and the actual experience of the masses are closely integrated. In pest control science and technology, attention should be paid to how to study the characteristics and patterns of insect pests to prevent their occurrence. When insect pests have already occurred, how to improve pest control technology and timely exterminate them to reduce crop losses and waste of manpower and material resources.

　　做好治虫准备工作
    席凤洲
    历年以来，由于各种虫害不断发生，农业生产上所受到的损失是很大的。因此各地群众要求扑灭害虫也非常迫切。去年虫害所发生的种类，最主要的有蝗虫、蚜虫、粘虫、稻螟虫、蝼蛄、红蜘蛛、土蚕等。为害的地区不仅蔓延到华北、华东、华中南各地区，即在东北、西北部分地区，也有不少虫害发生。现在“惊蛰节”已过，各种害虫将逐渐发生。在领导上如何准备扑灭虫害，防止减产，就成为一件大事。治虫工作要做得好，在虫子未发生以前，首先要进行预防。过去的经验告诉我们：那些地区治虫工作事前有准备，那些地区就能防止虫灾或减少虫灾。特别是蝗虫、蚜虫、粘虫的为害，稍一疏忽，即会遭到很大的损失。
    凡是去年发生过虫害的地区，今年还可能再次发生。应该及时进行虫害检查工作，告诉当地群众，积极准备，提高警惕，有计划的组织人力，进行刨卵、采卵、刨蛹、捕杀幼虫等工作。
    荒地也是害虫发生地，要消灭虫害，必须清除杂草，消灭荒地。去年华北部分地区发生了不少土蝗，据研究结果，凡是草滩山坡、坟地、地头、壕沟、地边，蝗虫就格外多，全是因为草多的原因。如山东渤海区，河南黄泛区，平原湖西专区，有不少荒地，虫害就相当严重。俗说“草多变虫窝”，就是这个道理。
    治虫所用的化学药品和器械，虽然也可充分去利用，但这些东西价钱贵，数量少，在目前还不能解决治虫基本问题。因此多吸取各地治虫土办法及经验，是非常重要的。事实上，不少地区，在治虫运动中，群众已经创造出来很多宝贵治虫经验。这些经验都需要去推广。
    要加强治虫领导工作与治虫技术研究工作。在蝗虫的发源地，或历年发生虫害的严重地区，应根据当地实际情况，进行虫害调查研究，完成防治虫害的准备工作。在虫子发生前后，应组织情报网，掌握虫害发生情况，按照不同的地区和季节，观察虫害的发生规律及特性，准备找寻害虫的弱点，以达到防除的目的。过去各地成立的除虫指挥部，在除虫运动中，曾发挥了很大作用。今年在虫害地区，要根据除虫工作的需要，恢复与建立这种临时性的除虫机构。以便在虫害到来时，负责组织动员工作，领导群众进行除虫斗争。因为大规模的除虫工作，是一个群众运动，必须依靠广大群众力量，组织起来，完成除虫准备及进行捕杀虫害等工作。
    除虫工作，不仅要注意组织领导，还要进行必要的科学技术指导与总结群众除虫经验，使除虫科学技术和群众的实际经验很紧密的结合起来。在除虫科学技术需要注意的，是如何研究虫害的特点和规律，以防止虫害发生。当虫害已经发生后，如何提高除虫技术及时扑灭，以减少作物损失和人力，物力的浪费。
