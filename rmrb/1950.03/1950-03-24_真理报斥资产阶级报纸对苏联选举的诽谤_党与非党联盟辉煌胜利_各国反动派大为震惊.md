Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th (TASS): *Pravda*'s commentator, analyzing the bourgeois newspapers' slanders against the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections, pointed out that the glorious victory obtained by the League of Party and Non-Party Members in the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections has greatly shocked the reactionaries and forces of war. In order to conceal the superiority of the socialist system and Soviet democracy from the people of capitalist countries, they have greatly distorted and slandered it. The fact that nearly 100% of Soviet voters participated in the election, and an equally high percentage of voters elected candidates from the League of Party and Non-Party Members, is an unprecedented fact in bourgeois parliamentary politics. The bourgeois newspapers have carried out arrogant slander against this, but the Soviet election system itself refutes these slanders. Soviet law guarantees the secrecy of the vote. In this election, 30,000 voters voted against the candidates of the League of Party and Non-Party Members, and they could not be subjected to any retaliation, as is the case in capitalist countries. The bourgeois newspapers discredited the high consciousness of Soviet voters, saying there was a "lack of political seriousness." This provocation cannot damage the joyful and inspiring mood of Soviet citizens, who are advancing from one achievement to another. On the contrary, these achievements have made the bourgeois propagandists frown.

The bourgeois propagandists shamelessly measure Soviet life by their own standards. They do not want to admit that the Soviet people enjoy the highest form of democracy, in which all the people truly participate in the composition of the highest organs of state power. They attempt to slander the voting system and the compilation of the list of candidates for the two chambers of the Soviet, saying that Soviet voters "cannot decide on candidates" and that Soviet voters "have no choice because there is only one candidate on the list." They attempt to obliterate the facts that Soviet candidates are nominated by public organizations and then undergo thorough and careful discussions at mass meetings, and finally obtain the consent of voters at the congress. These facts are unimaginable in capitalist countries.

Soviet society has eliminated exploitation, and the people are the masters of the country, with common interests. The Communist Party represents the common interests of the people. This well illustrates the harmony and unity of the election. This is in stark contrast to the internal class contradictions in capitalist countries and the division of the ruling class groups vying for power.

The bourgeois newspapers say that "Soviet elections decide nothing," which precisely exposes their own anxiety. They are clearly aware that the results of the Soviet elections have solved many major problems. The Soviet people have voted in favor of peace and in favor of communism, and have shown political unity around the Bolshevik Party and Stalin. The Soviet Supreme Soviet election was conducted under the slogan of loyalty to universal peace and the construction of communism in the Soviet Union. The weakness of the bourgeois propaganda machine's slander of the glorious achievements of socialist democracy lies precisely in this.

　　真理报斥资产阶级报纸对苏联选举的诽谤
    党与非党联盟辉煌胜利
    各国反动派大为震惊
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报评论家分析资产阶级报纸对苏联最高苏维埃选举的诽谤，指出苏联党与非党联盟在苏联最高苏维埃选举中所获得的辉煌胜利，已使反动派和战争力量大为震惊。他们为在资本主义国家人民面前掩盖社会主义制度的优越性及苏联的民主，就大肆歪曲诽谤。苏联几近百分之百的选民参加了选举，并有同样高的百分率的选民选举了党与非党联盟候选人，这是资产阶级议会政治中闻所未闻的事实。资产阶级报纸对之进行了狂妄的毁谤，但苏联选举制度本身驳倒了这些谰言。苏联法律保障投票的秘密，这次选举中三万个投票反对党与非党联盟候选人的选民，而他们不可能像在资本主义国家一样，受到任何报复。资产阶级报纸诋毁苏联选民的高度自觉，说什么“缺乏政治严肃性”，这种挑衅丝毫不能破坏从一个成就迈向另一个成就的苏联公民的欢欣鼓舞的心情，相反地，这些成就却使得资产阶级宣传家们一个个愁眉苦脸。
    资产阶级宣传家厚颜地以自己的尺度来衡量苏联的生活，他们不想承认苏联人民享受着最高形式的民主，在这种民主下面，全体人民都真正参加国家最高权力机关的组成。他们企图诬蔑投票制度和苏维埃两院候选人名单的编纂，说什么苏联选民“不能决定候选人”，苏联选民“没有选择权，因为名单上只有一个候选人”，他们企图抹杀这些事实，即苏联候选人由公众组织提名后，在群众大会上经过周密审慎的讨论，最后才能在大会上得到选民的同意。这些事实在资本主义国家本来是不可想像的。
    苏维埃社会消灭了剥削，人民是国家的主人，有着共同的利益，而代表人民共同利益的就是共产党。这就很好地说明了选举的和谐一致。这和资本主义国家内部的阶级矛盾，统治阶级集团为争权夺利而四分五裂的情形刚刚相反。
    资产阶级报纸说什么“苏联选举决定不了什么”，这恰恰暴露了他们自己的焦虑。苏联选举结果解决了许多重大问题，这一点他们是清楚知道的。苏联人民已投票拥护和平，拥护共产主义，并表明了在政治上一致团结在布尔什维克党和斯大林的周围。苏联最高苏维埃选举是在忠于普遍和平、在苏联建设共产主义的口号下进行的。资产阶级的宣传机关对社会主义民主辉煌成就的诽谤的软弱无力，原因亦即在此。
