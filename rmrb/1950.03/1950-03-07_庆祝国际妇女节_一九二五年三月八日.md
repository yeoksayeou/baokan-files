　　Celebrating International Women's Day
    ——March 8, 1925
    Stalin
    No great movement of the oppressed in human history can do without the participation of working women. Working women are the most oppressed among all the oppressed. They never have been and cannot be bystanders on the road to liberation. The slave liberation movement, as everyone knows, has produced hundreds and thousands of female martyrs and heroines. In the ranks of those fighting for the emancipation of serfs, there were tens of thousands of peasant women. The revolutionary movement of the working class is the most powerful of all liberation movements of the oppressed masses. Therefore, it is not surprising that it attracts millions of working women under its banner.
    International Women's Day is a symbol of the invincibility of the working-class liberation movement and a harbinger of its great future.
    Working women – female workers and peasant women – are the great reserve army of the working class. This reserve army accounts for exactly half of the population. Whether the women's reserve army supports or opposes the working class will determine the fate of the proletarian movement, the success or failure of the proletarian revolution, and the success or failure of the proletarian regime. Therefore, the primary task of the proletariat and its advanced team – the Communist Party – is to carry out a resolute struggle to liberate women – female workers and peasant women – from the influence of the bourgeoisie, to conduct political education among female workers and peasant women under the banner of the proletariat, and to organize them.
    International Women's Day is a means of winning the working women's reserve army to the side of the proletariat.
    But working women are not just a reserve army. Under the correct policies of the working class, they can and should become a real army of the working class against the bourgeoisie. To train the working women's reserve army into an army of working women and peasant women, so that they can act side by side with the great army of the proletariat – this is the second and decisive task of the working class.
    International Women's Day should become a means of transforming working women and peasant women from the reserve army of the working class into the active army of the proletarian liberation movement.
    Long live International Women's Day!

　　庆祝国际妇女节
    ——一九二五年三月八日
    斯大林
    人类历史上被压迫者的任何一次伟大运动，都非有劳动妇女的参加不可。劳动妇女是一切被压迫者当中最受压迫的。她们从不是也不能是留在解放运动的大道边的旁观者。奴隶解放运动，大家知道，曾经涌现了成百成千的女殉难者和女英雄。在争取农奴解放的战士队伍中，也有成万的农妇。工人阶级的革命运动，是被压迫群众的一切解放运动中最强大的运动。因之，它把数百万劳动妇女吸引在自己的旗帜下面，这是不足为奇的。
    国际妇女节乃是工人阶级解放运动不可战胜之标志和其伟大前程之前驱。
    劳动妇女——女工和农妇，乃是工人阶级的伟大后备军。这个后备军正好占人口之一半。妇女后备军是拥护工人阶级还是反对工人阶级，——无产阶级运动的命运，无产阶级革命的成败，无产阶级政权的成败，将依此而定。所以，无产阶级及其先进队伍——共产党的头一个任务，就在于进行坚决的斗争，把妇女——女工和农妇从资产阶级的影响下解放出来，在无产阶级的旗帜之下，对女工和农妇进行政治教育，并且把她们组织起来。
    国际妇女节是争取劳动妇女后备军站到无产阶级方面的一种手段。
    但劳动妇女，不仅是后备军而已。她们在工人阶级的正确政策之下能够成为而且应当成为工人阶级的一支真正的军队，以反对资产阶级。把劳动妇女后备军锻炼成为一支工农妇女军，使之与无产阶级的大军并肩行动，——这就是工人阶级的第二个和决定性的任务。
    国际妇女节应成为一种把工农妇女从工人阶级的后备军变成为无产阶级解放运动的现役军之手段。
    国际妇女节万岁！
