Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 19th: The Chongqing Military Control Commission Industry Department, in accordance with the Central People's Government's decision on investigating warehouses, has ordered all public factories to inventory materials in order to eliminate the phenomenon of national property being damaged and destroyed, a legacy of the Kuomintang's corrupt rule. According to preliminary inspections from the 6th to the 14th of this month, a large amount of materials that had been abandoned for a long time during the Kuomintang rule were discovered. Although some factories have been taken over for more than three months, and the Industry Department has successively allocated 1.5 billion yuan to various factories to build warehouses, the persons in charge of these factories have consistently failed to pay serious attention to the work of protecting and cleaning up materials, resulting in a large amount of important materials still being scattered in open spaces, with no one caring about them. The 21st Arsenal has 3,480 tons of important steel materials, 238 machines, and 68 boxes of Japanese reparations materials (mostly machines) stored in the open air. In addition, there are at least more than 3,000 tons of scattered but usable scrap iron and steel. At the Egongyan branch of the factory, many steel materials were buried by mud, and many have rusted. The waste of materials at the 29th Arsenal is even more serious. The finished steel materials exposed in the open air amount to 4,000 tons, some of which have been exposed for as long as seven or eight years and have become rusted and damaged. In addition, more than 200 tons of important materials scattered in various places include carbon rods, steel wire ropes, water pipes, boiler tubes, etc., a steam engine of 8,000 horsepower, a blast furnace blower of 250 tons, and four cranes of 20 tons and 60 tons, as well as important components such as rolling steel bars. In some factory buildings, many waste shells have not been safely disposed of.
    The above-mentioned serious phenomena, after preliminary inspection and cleanup, have aroused the attention of various factories and achieved significant improvements. The 21st Arsenal has moved 3,480 tons of steel materials indoors, and concentrated 1,270 tons of scrap steel, which was transported to the 29th Arsenal as steelmaking raw materials. The 29th Arsenal has also dismantled dangerous shells for safe disposal, and finished steel materials are being moved into warehouses one after another, and important machines have also begun to be cleaned up. The material cleanup work of other public factories and mines is continuing.

    开始清查仓库物资  发现大量被弃器材
    【新华社重庆十九日电】重庆市军管会工业部已遵照中央人民政府关于清查仓库的决定，命令各公营工厂清点物资，以消灭国民党腐败统治遗留下来的国家财产被损毁破坏的现象。据本月六日至十四日初步检查结果，发现大批在国民党统治时期即被长期抛置的物资，而若干工厂虽已接管三个多月，且工业部已先后拨款十五亿给各厂修建仓库，但这些工厂的负责人对爱护和清理物资的工作，却始终未予严重注意，以致大量重要物资至今仍散置空场，无人过问。二十一兵工厂露天堆存的重要物资有钢料三千四百八十吨，机器二百三十八部及日本赔偿物资六十八箱（多系机器），另有零散但可利用的废铁废钢至少有三千余吨。该厂鹅公岩分厂，很多钢料被泥土淹埋，不少已经生锈。二十九兵工厂物资浪费的情况更为严重。露置空场的成品钢料即达四千吨。其中有暴露已达七八年之久因而锈烂损毁者。此外散失各地的重要物资尚有炭精棒、钢丝绳、水管、锅炉管等二百余吨，八千匹马力蒸汽机一部，二百五十吨炼铁炉鼓风机一部及二十吨与六十吨吊车四部和轧钢棍等重要机件。有些厂房内则很多废炮弹尚未加以安全处理。
    上述严重现象，经过初步检查和清理后，已引起各厂重视，得到显著改进。二十一兵工厂已将钢料三千四百八十吨移入室内，并集中废钢铁一千二百七十吨，运二十九兵工厂作为炼钢原料。二十九兵工厂亦已将危险之炮弹拆卸加以安全处理，成品钢料陆续移入库房，重要机器亦已开始清理。其他各公营厂矿的物资清理工作，正继续进行中。
