Yancheng Prefecture has a total of seven counties, and six of them have now started study in the county-level directly affiliated organizations. During this period, cadre study in various counties and districts was affected by water management and land reclamation, with large numbers of cadres departing, and generally did not take place. For example, the entire Eleventh District of Jianyang did not hold any study discussion meetings, and they reported that they couldn't study because there were too few people at home.

As for the leadership of on-the-job cadre study, most comrades in many county and district committees are members of the study committee, but they are not concerned about leading the study, and they have consistently stood outside the study circle. The study committees or responsible comrades at all levels rarely summarize and solve problems in the study, and even if they did some in the past, they just copied and recited from the books, and dared not develop and connect with actual work and thinking. Most counties have not even done this, which makes the study movement unable to improve, and some problems that are vaguely understood in the study cannot be solved. This is the biggest problem existing in the on-the-job cadre study, and it has not been overcome yet!

According to the experience gained from more than half a year of carrying out the study, to make the study develop and persist for a long time, it must be led by the leaders, guaranteed by the branch, and establish a normal life and work system. The reason why the on-the-job cadre study in Fudong can be done better is mainly because the county party committee took the lead in studying. Secondly, with the guarantee of the branch, the consciousness of on-the-job cadre study is guaranteed. To open up the thinking of study, in addition to general mobilization and appeals, it is necessary to combine serious criticism and self-criticism in the party's organizational life. Only by carrying out ideological struggle in the study can the normality of the study mood be guaranteed and a correct learning attitude be established. This has been proven by the reports of various counties and the experiences of the directly affiliated organs of the prefecture. In order to do a good job in study, it is necessary to master an accurate work and life system. This is a necessary condition for study. Only with a formal work system and life system can the contradiction between work and study and the tendency of事務主義 be overcome.

The general study process of various organs in the Yancheng area goes through three steps: reading and chatting, posing questions for discussion, and drawing conclusions. These three are indispensable; in the past, we have also taken many detours in this regard and gained many experiences and lessons, which are manifested in the following specific issues: (1) The relationship between reading and discussion: In the past, in many places, we spent more time on discussion than reading, or mechanically grasped the two steps of reading and discussion, which often made the content of the discussion meeting without a focus, rambling, and everyone felt boring. For example, the Sheyang County Government once stipulated that a ten-day study period would require eight or nine days of discussion. The directly affiliated organs of the prefectural committee once mechanically stipulated that reading in the morning and discussing in the evening, often because the life system was not strict and the time was muddled, there was no good reading, and the discussion was started in the evening. This made the discussion completely meaningless. Our research believes that the correct way to master this is: read well in advance, think well in the reading and raise questions to find problems, and then organize discussions. The leading study organs should flexibly grasp according to the actual situation and not mechanically divide the study steps. (2) The relationship between group discussion and large group discussion: The bias we found in the past is that, for example, the Yancheng County Government used large group discussion as the only way to solve problems for a period of time. At the beginning, there were sixty or seventy people attending the meeting, but gradually it was reduced to twenty or thirty people. Only a few activists monopolized the meeting, and most people held the attitude of "listening to the meeting" and "watching the meeting." Other Liandong districts also had similar phenomena, which became a formalistic learning method. We believe that large group discussions must be held when there are heated debates in the group and it is difficult to solve the points of divergence. Only then can large group or conference discussions be used, which can easily arouse everyone's learning mood and gradually develop heated debates in an atmosphere of concentrated will and tense emotions, to achieve the goal of finally solving the problem. (3) How to prepare for the central speech: We have also made many biases, such as a study branch directly under the special office. They had a key person to prepare the central speech, but ignored the leadership of the general comrades to prepare, and in the discussion, the central speaker always spoke first, creating a dependence of everyone, thinking that someone has already prepared it specially anyway, why should we bother to find trouble?! This also produces a kind of illusion for some study committee leaders; thinking that it is not necessary to prepare the central speech at the study discussion meeting, such as the study branch of the organization department of the prefectural committee, proposed to cancel the preparation of the central speech, and returned to the general unprepared and meaningless study discussion meeting. We believe that the best method is to combine key preparation with general preparation. Comrades with high level should be assigned to prepare a question to give specific help to the general comrades. The general comrades can make comprehensive preparations. During the discussion, the general comrades should speak universally first, organize debates, and finally the central speaker should speak to supplement and analyze and correct some erroneous arguments. (4) The method of raising questions: For example, the Jianyang Study Branch formulated a number of specific questions according to the focus of study in each period and arranged the study, which we think is flawed. Because the leaders put forward too specific study questions too early to arrange the study, the study of the cadres below (especially the cadres with low level) will be restricted, and it will be difficult to develop the study thinking. According to the experience of various places, the more correct way is to adopt the method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, that is, first requiring each group to organize reading well, focusing on solving some ideological doubts, and then the leaders summarizing a number of specific research questions according to the actual ideological situation and study progress, and taking them down for discussion, which is more enlightening for cadre study.

The issue of combining theory with practice: At present, there is a more common tendency of reciting articles without paying attention to understanding, let alone connecting with reality. The counties reflected that everyone copied notes from each other during study and recited answers (mostly cadres with poor standards). These comrades have a very good spirit of study, but because this method is an old way of rote learning, they are often very depressed in their emotions. For example, some comrades in Fudong reflected that they forgot it after a month of reciting, and many comrades have wrong views on the connection between theory and practice, thinking that only studying documents related to the work of their own departments can be connected. The so-called method of connecting theory with practice must first have a good understanding of the document, and then connect with practice step by step, applying abstract theory to the analysis of specific facts. For example, Fudong's promotion of the economic policy of the commune is connected to the understanding of stabilizing market prices, and the Dongkan branch's study of the economic cooperative policy can be connected to the transformation of the cooperative, which are all good examples.

### 盐城地委宣传部领导在职干部学习的经验

　　盐城地委宣传部领导在职干部学习的经验
    盐城专区共七个县，现已有六个县的县直机关搞起学习。各县区干部学习，在这一期间由于治水兴垦影响，干部大批出发，一般都没有进行。例如建阳十一区全部未开过学习讨论会，他们反映家里人少学不起来。
    至于在职干部领导上，大部分县区不少同志身为学委，恰对领导学习不关心，自己一贯站在学习圈外。各级学委会或负责同志，很少对学习中的疑难问题做总结进行解决问题，过去即使做了些的，也只是照书抄念，不敢加以发挥连系实际工作和思想。而大部县则连这一点也未见做到，致使学习运动不得提高，学习中存在着若干似懂非懂的问题得不到解决，这是在职干部学习存在着的最大问题，至今尚无法克服！
    根据半年多开展学习以来的经验证明，要使得学习能够开展并长期的坚持下去，必须是领导带头、支部保证和建立正常的生活与工作制度。阜东在职干部学习能够搞得比较好一些，主要原因是该县县委带头来学。其次有了支部保证，即是在职干部学习的自觉性有了保证。打通学习思想，除一般动员号召以外，必须结合党的组织生活上的严肃批评与自我批评。只有开展学习上的思想斗争，才能保证学习情绪的正常性，树立起正确的学习态度。这是各县汇报上及地专直属机关经验都证明了的。为了搞好学习，必须掌握准确的工作生活制度。这是学习的必须条件，只有正规的工作制度和生活制度，才能克服工作与学习的矛盾和事务主义的偏向。
    盐城地区各机关一般学习的过程是经过三个步骤：阅读漫谈，出题讨论，作结论。这三个是缺一不可的；过去我们在这方面，亦走过不少弯路，得到不少经验教训，表现在如下具体问题上：（一）阅读与讨论关系上：过去我们不少地方讨论时间多于阅读，或机械掌握阅读与讨论两个步骤，往往使讨论会的内容毫无重心，东扯西拉，大家都感觉枯燥无味，例如射阳县府，曾有一个时间，规定一个十天的学习阶段，便要讨论上八九天。地委直属机关曾有一个时间，机械规定着早上阅读晚上讨论，往往早上或因生活制度不严时间一混过去，并没有很好阅读，晚上也就抓起讨论了。这样使讨论完全变成无意义的事情。我们研究的结果，认为正确掌握的方法：应事先很好阅读，在阅读中很好思索提出疑问发现问题，然后才可组织讨论。领导学习机关要根据实际情况灵活掌握，不要机械分学习步骤。（二）小组讨论与大组讨论关系上：我们过去发现的偏向是，例如盐城县府有一个时期，运用大会讨论当作解决问题的唯一办法，到会初六十多人，渐次减到二三十人，发言时只有少数积极分子在会场上包办，大多数人抱着“听会”与“看会”态度。其他涟东区亦有过类似这种现象，变成了形式主义的学习方法。我们认为，进行大组讨论，一定要在小组有热烈争论，发现分歧点难得解决时始用大组或大会讨论，才易引起大家的学习情绪，逐渐在大家意志集中情绪紧张的空气下，开展起热烈的争论，达到最后解决问题目的。（三）如何准备中心发言的问题：我们也犯过不少的偏向，如专署直属某学习支会，他们有了重点准备中心发言人，便忽略了领导一般同志去做准备，在讨论时每次都是中心发言人首起发言，造成大家依赖思想，认为横竖已有人专门准备，我们又何必去找麻烦哩？！由此亦产生某些学委会领导同志的一种错觉；以为在学习讨论会上，准备中心发言人是没有必要的，如地委组织部学习支会便提出取消准备中心发言人，仍然回复到一般化的无准备无意味的学习讨论会中去了。我们认为最好的方法是重点准备与一般准备相结合，水平高的同志分工准备一个问题，以便给一般同志以具体帮助，一般同志可作全面准备，讨论时先由一般同志普遍发言，组织争论，最后中心发言人发言，进行补充分析，改正某些错误论点。（四）提问题的方法：例如建阳学习分会根据每一时期学习重点，拟成若干具体问题，进行布置学习，我们认为是有缺点的。因为领导上过早的拟出过于具体的学习问题来布置学习，会使下面干部学习（尤其是水平低的干部）受到束缚，学习思想不易开展。根据各地经验比较正确的是采取从群众中来到群众中去的办法，即是首先要求各小组很好地组织阅读，有重点地解决若干思想疑问，然后领导上依据实际思想状况及学习进度归纳成若干具体的研究问题，拿到下面讨论，对干部学习更有启发的作用。
    理论联系实际问题：目前较普遍的存在背诵条文不注意理解，更不能联系实际的教条主义的偏向。各县反映，大家学习时相互抄录笔记，背诵答案（大半是水准差的干部）。这些同志的学习精神是很好的，但是由于这种方式是一种旧的死读书方式，因而他们情绪上常是很苦闷的，如阜东个别同志反映，背上一个月就忘记了，并有不少同志对理论与实际联系存在错误看法，认为学习与本部门工作有关的文件才能联系。所谓理论与实际联系的方法，必须首先很好的理解文件，再一步一步地联系实际，将抽象的理论应用到分析具体的事实中去，如阜东推进社学习经济政策联系到认识稳定市场物价，东坎支会学习了经济合作社政策，能联系到改造合作社，都是很好的范例。
