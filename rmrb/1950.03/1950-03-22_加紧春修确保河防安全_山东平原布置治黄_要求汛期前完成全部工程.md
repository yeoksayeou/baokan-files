　　Step Up Spring Repairs to Ensure River Defense Safety
    Shandong and Pingyuan Deploy Yellow River Management
    Requiring Completion of All Projects Before Flood Season
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] As the Yellow River spring repair period is approaching, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government recently held a Yellow River management work conference, and the Shandong Provincial People's Government also issued instructions on Yellow River spring repairs.
    The Pingyuan Provincial Yellow River management work conference was held from the 7th to the 13th of last month. The conference determined this year's Yellow River management task as: raising the embankment line by 1.5 meters above last year's highest flood level, and raising the dam foundation by 1 meter above last year's highest flood level. In order to complete this task, the conference also stipulated the following measures: (1) Implement a contract system, while absorbing as many disaster victims as possible to participate in embankment repairs; (2) In the spirit of "selecting the essential and the dangerous," carry out repairs in order of priority; (3) In addition to the transportation brigade being responsible for stone transportation, organize private boats to jointly transport it; (4) Implement the abolition of people-built embankments and earnestly manage the dike river string ditches; (5) Universally establish dike protection organizations and strictly enforce the dike protection covenants; (6) Assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for the safekeeping of materials and implement budget and final account systems; (7) Strengthen the cultural, political, and technical learning of cadres and workers.
    The Shandong Provincial People's Government issued instructions on Yellow River spring repairs in early this month, requiring the completion of all spring repair projects before the flood season, in order to gain greater initiative in flood control and ensure the safety of river defenses. The instructions first pointed out: It is necessary to prevent complacency among cadres and the masses due to the victory in Yellow River management last year, and to recognize that although the Yellow River management work in the past three years has achieved certain results and experience, the crisis of river defense still exists as long as the fundamental problems have not been resolved. Therefore, cadres and the masses must clearly recognize the important significance of this year's spring repairs. Secondly, regarding the issue of spring repairs combined with disaster relief, the instructions pointed out: It is necessary to correctly grasp the meaning of "work relief." The purpose of Yellow River spring repairs is to strengthen embankment projects. This is the greatest interest of the people along the Yellow River. Therefore, disaster relief must be subordinate to the project, and the consolidation of the project must not be ignored by simply thinking about relieving disaster victims. The two should be well integrated, and no deviation is allowed. Finally, the instructions pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership in spring repairs. People's governments at all levels in the Yellow River area and the Yellow River River Affairs Bureau should jointly organize a spring repair headquarters to specifically lead the smooth progress of spring repair work.

　　加紧春修确保河防安全
    山东平原布置治黄
    要求汛期前完成全部工程
    【新华社二十日讯】由于黄河春修期即将到来，平原省人民政府在最近召开治黄工作会议，山东省人民政府也发出关于黄河春修的指示。
    平原省的治黄工作会议系于上月七日至十三日举行，会议确定了今年的治黄任务为：将堤线较去年最高洪水位提高一点五公尺，坝基较去年最高洪水位提高一公尺。为了完成这个任务，会议并规定以下几项措施：（一）实行包工制，同时尽量吸收灾民参加修堤；（二）本“择要择险”精神，分别主次进行修整；（三）石料运输除由运输大队负责外，并组织私船共同运输；（四）贯彻废除民埝，认真治理堤河串沟；（五）普遍建立护堤组织，严格执行护堤公约；（六）设专人负责保管物料，并执行预算、决算制度；（七）加强干部和工人的文化、政治，技术的学习。
    山东省人民政府于本月上旬发出了关于黄河春修的指示，要求在汛期前完成全部春修工程，以求在防汛中取得更大的主动，确保河防的安全。指示首先指出：必须防止干部和人民群众因去年治黄胜利而产生的麻痹思想，要认识到三年来的治黄工作虽获得了一定的成绩和经验，但在治本问题未得解决以前，河防危机始终存在。因此，干部、群众必须明确认识今年春修的重要意义。其次，关于春修结合救灾问题，指示指出：必须正确掌握“以工代赈”的意义，黄河春修的目的是为加强堤防工程。这是沿黄人民的最大利益。因此，救灾必须服从工程，不能单从救济灾民着想而忽略工程的巩固，两者应很好地结合起来，不容许有任何偏差。最后，指示指出：在春修中必须加强组织领导，沿黄河地区各级人民政府和黄河河务局应共同组织春修指挥部，以具体领导春修工作的顺利进行。
