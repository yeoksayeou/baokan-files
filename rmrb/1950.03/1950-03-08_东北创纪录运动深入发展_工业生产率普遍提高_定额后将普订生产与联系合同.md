　　Northeast's Record-Breaking Movement Deepens
    Industrial Productivity Universally Increases
    Production Quotas to be Set and Production Contracts Widely Adopted
    [This dispatch from Shenyang] Reporter Ai Fang reports: The new record-breaking movement in Northeast industrial production, which began last October, has achieved great success in the past five months, pushing Northeast economic construction into a new era. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department, as of the end of December 1949, the number of people creating new production records in various factories and mines had reached 50,799, including workers in industries such as steel, machinery, coal mining, electricity, textiles, and non-ferrous metals. In Fushun alone, 12,808 workers created new records. The number of record-breakers in factories under the Anshan Iron and Steel Company also reached 9,003. Outstanding individuals such as Zhao Guoyou, Zhang Shangju, Dang Huian, Li Qingxuan, and Zhao Guanghe emerged during the movement. They achieved significant results in inventing and improving tools and improving operating techniques. In the past, machining a pulley took an estimated sixteen hours of work. After improving his tools, machinist Zhao Guoyou created a record of one hour and sixteen minutes, and Tong Junshan surpassed Zhao Guoyou with thirty-seven minutes. Zhao Guanghe of the Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory, after long and painstaking research, successfully trial-produced emery, solving the essential raw material problem for grinding wheels in industrial construction. This provided the prerequisite for the factory to complete this year's production and construction tasks, winning him a special award and a prize of 3 million Northeast currency (equivalent to 30 million old Northeast currency) from the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government. Li Qingxuan of the Hegang Coal Mine invented a slotting drill and a reciprocating transport vehicle. The slotting drill not only shortened the drilling time for coal mining but also saved 37.5% of detonators and 48% of gunpowder per meter of tunneling. In the past, the daily output of No. 1 blast furnace in the Iron Smelting Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was 400 tons. After improving equipment and operating techniques, the output reached 550 tons on November 5 last year, and finally increased to 620 tons, breaking the pseudo-Manchukuo standard. After miners Zhao Zhongdong of Fuxin Mine and workers of Xi'an Coal Mine improved the stacking and thick seam mining methods, coal mining efficiency was greatly improved, and material consumption was reduced by 3% to 4%. Yu Xueshan of the Shenyang Farm Implement Factory created a new record for improving quality and successfully trial-produced red alloy bushings (bearing bushings on tractor crankshafts), replacing white alloy bushings, increasing production efficiency by 150 times. In terms of saving and reducing costs, the Fushun Firebrick Factory adopted workers' reasonable suggestions and used refractory bricks instead of burnt powder, saving over 177.79 million yuan (equivalent to 1.7779 billion old Northeast currency). According to statistics from the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department, the 244 factories and mines had a total of 959 inventions and creations and 2,944 technical operation improvements. Although these inventions and technical improvements accounted for only 20% of all new records, their value is significant.
            Compared to June of last year December productivity increased by 32%
    In the new record-breaking movement, due to the increased class consciousness of the vast number of workers and the establishment of a new attitude towards labor, the efficiency of machine production was more fully realized, thus enabling some production units to more reasonably determine production quotas or create conditions for quota setting. More importantly, some experience in determining quotas was explored. In the process of setting quotas, many problems in labor organization and machine allocation were discovered, and the causes and solutions for unreasonable phenomena such as work stoppages and waiting for materials were found, making production organization more scientific and reasonable. On this basis, units such as the Shenyang Machine Fifth Factory and Third Factory implemented continuous operation methods, which not only improved production efficiency but also accelerated capital turnover. With the help of Soviet experts, the most advanced production management methods were used to establish and improve various reporting systems. Many factories have already established contact contracts for workshops and teams. Individual factories and mines have also gained initial experience in trying out collective contracts. As factories and mines continue to create new records, the productivity of Northeast industry has generally increased. According to a preliminary survey by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, the productivity in November or December 1949 increased by 32.83% compared to June of the same year. If the average figure for the second half of the year is compared with June, it increased by 12.72%. As a result, production costs were greatly reduced, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. According to incomplete statistics (less than half of all mines and factories), 14,857 new records in various factories and mines created a value of 68.55 billion yuan (equivalent to 688.5 billion old Northeast currency) in four months. Due to the great achievements of the new record-breaking movement, it will further accelerate the development of Northeast industrial construction this year.
            Some factories and mines pursue quantity and neglect quality
    However, there are still some shortcomings and errors caused by sloppy work in the new record-breaking movement. The main problems are neglecting production quality, lax labor discipline, and some factories and mines breaking away from production tasks and plans to create new records. For example, in order to increase the number of steel tapping times, the Anshan Steel Plant shortened the smelting time from eight to ten hours to five hours and fifteen minutes, which not only resulted in poor quality but also damaged the furnace roof and shortened its lifespan. Some mines, or some parts of some mines and factories, excessively pursued product quantity, resulting in a decline in quality and an increase in scrap and rework rates. Shenyang Machine First Factory and Benxi Machinery Factory created many new records in October and November last year, but failed to complete their production plans, which is an unreasonable phenomenon. In December last year, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, while pointing out that the new record-breaking movement in various factories and mines should establish different priorities according to different situations, proposed that some factories and mines should pay special attention to quality. On January 31 this year, it also issued a "Decision on Ensuring Improved Quality and Establishing a Strict Inspection System," stating: "All so-called new records that violate technical operating procedures, damage machines, or produce unqualified products are harmful and useless. They cannot be considered new records." In addition to strictly paying attention to quality, in order to overcome imbalances in the movement, administrative and trade union leaders in each factory and mine are planned to lead the general adoption of linkage contracts in the first quarter (January, February, and March) of 1950. Collective contracts will also be piloted in individual factories and mines with the necessary conditions to gain experience.
    The Northeast new record-breaking movement has developed to the present stage, and has moved from a vigorous stage to a new period requiring further improvement. This means further determining reasonable quotas, establishing production and collective contracts, implementing the economic accounting system, eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and ensuring the accurate completion of national plans.

### 东北创纪录运动深入发展  工业生产率普遍提高  定额后将普订生产与联系合同

　　东北创纪录运动深入发展
    工业生产率普遍提高     
    定额后将普订生产与联系合同
    【本报沈阳特讯】记者艾方报导：去年十月开展的东北工业生产新纪录运动，五个月来获得巨大成绩，使东北经济建设推向一个新的时期。根据东北人民政府工业部不完全的统计材料，截至一九四九年十二月底，各厂矿创造生产新纪录的人数即已达五万零七百九十九人，包括钢铁、机械、煤矿、电业、纺织、有色金属等产业部门职工。只抚顺一地，即有一万二千八百零八个职工创造了新纪录。鞍山钢铁公司所属各厂创纪录者亦达九千零三人。运动中涌现了像赵国有、张尚举、党会安、李庆萱、赵广和等杰出的人材。他们在发明和改进工具、改进操作技术方面，获得显著成绩。过去车一个塔轮估工十六小时，车工赵国有在改进工具后，创造一时十六分钟的纪录，而佟俊山则以三十七分钟超过赵国有。苏家屯砂轮工厂赵广和，经过长期苦心研究，试炼金钢砂成功，解决了工业建设上不可缺少的砂轮原料，给该厂完成今年生产建设任务创造了前提条件，荣获东北人民政府工业部特等奖及奖金三百万元（合东北币三千万元）。鹤岗煤矿李庆萱发明掏槽钎子和往复式运输车。掏槽钎子不仅缩短了采煤打眼时间，并使每米掘进节省雷管百分之三十七点五，节约火药百分之四十八。鞍山钢铁公司炼铁部一号高炉过去每日产量是四百吨，经改良设备及操作技术之后，去年十一月五日产量即达到五百五十吨，最后增至六百二十吨，突破了伪满标准。阜新矿工赵仲冬和西安煤矿工人改进堆积式和厚煤层采煤法以后，采煤效率大大提高，材料消耗减少百分之三至百分之四。沈阳农具厂于学山，创造提高质量的新纪录，试制赤色合金瓦（拖拉机曲轴上的坐瓦）成功，代替了白色合金瓦，生产效率提高一百五十倍。在节约降低成本方面：抚顺火砖厂采纳工人合理建议，以耐火砖代替烧粉后，节约了一亿七千七百九十余万元（合东北币十七亿七千九百余万元）。根据东北人民政府工业部统计，二百四十四个厂矿的发明创造共有九百五十九件，改进技术操作的有二千九百四十四件。这些创造发明和技术改进，虽然只占其全部新纪录的百分之二十，但其价值是很大的。
            去年十二月份与六月份比较  生产率提高百分之三十二
    在创新纪录运动中，由于广大职工的阶级觉悟提高，树立了新的劳动态度，机器生产效能得以较充分的发挥，因而在某些生产单位中，便能较合理的确定生产定额，或给定额工作创造了条件；更重要的，是摸索出了一些确定定额的经验。在进行定额工作中，发现了劳动组织、机器配备中的很多毛病，找出了造成停工待料等不合理现象的原因和克服办法，使生产组织得以更加科学合理。在这个基础上，沈阳机器第五厂、第三厂等单位都实行了连续作业法，不但生产效率提高了，资金周转也加快了。在苏联专家帮助之下，运用了最先进的生产管理方法，建立和改善了各种表报制度。不少厂子已经订立车间、小组的联系合同。个别厂矿并已取得试订集体合同的初步经验。由于各厂矿不断创造出新纪录，东北工业的生产率已普遍提高。根据东北人民政府工业部的初步调查，一九四九年的十一月或十二月，与同年的六月份作比，生产率提高了百分之三十二点八三。如以下半年平均数字和六月份比，则提高百分之十二点七二。因之生产成本大大降低，为国家创造了大量财富。据不完全统计（不足全数矿厂的二分之一）各厂矿一万四千八百五十七件新纪录，四个月创造的价值是六百八十五亿五千万元（合东北币六千八百八十五亿元）。由于创新纪录运动获得了以上的伟大成绩，这会更加速东北今年工业建设的发展。
            某些厂矿追逐数量  产生忽视质量偏向
    但新纪录运动中，也还存在一些缺点，和工作潦草所造成的错误。主要是忽视生产质量，劳动纪律不严格，和有些厂矿脱离生产任务与计划来创新纪录。如鞍山炼钢厂，为了增加出钢次数，每次熔炼时间由八至十小时缩短为五点十五分，结果不仅质量不好，且使炉顶受损，寿命缩短。某些矿厂，或某些厂矿的某些部分，过分追求产品数量，致使质量下降，废品和退修率增加。沈阳机器一厂和本溪机械厂，去年十月和十一月创造了很多新纪录，但未完成生产计划，这是不合理的现象。去年十二月间，东北人民政府工业部，在指出各厂矿新纪录运动应根据不同情况确立不同重心中，即提出了某些厂矿应特别注意质量。今年一月三十一日又作了“关于保证提高质量建立严格的检查制度的决定”，指出：“一切破坏技术操作规程，损坏机器，或产品不合格的所谓新纪录，都是有害无益的。都不能成为新纪录。”除严格注意质量外，为了克服运动中的不平衡现象，一九五○年第一季度（一、二、三月份）各厂矿计划中，都规定行政和工会要领导普遍订立联系合同。在个别条件具备的厂矿，并试行集体合同，以取得经验。
    东北新纪录运动发展到现在，已由轰轰烈烈的阶段，进到一个需要提高一步的新时期，这就是：进一步确定合理定额，订定联系合同和集体合同，贯彻经济核算制，消灭无人负责现象，保证国家计划准确的完成。
