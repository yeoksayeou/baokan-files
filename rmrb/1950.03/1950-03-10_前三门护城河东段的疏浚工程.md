The Dredging Project of the Eastern Section of the Qian Sanmen Moat
　　Xiang Bo
　　The upstream of the Qian Sanmen Moat is the West Moat, which enters the city through the Xibianmen Water Gate, passes Xuanwumen, Qianmen, and Chongwenmen, and exits the city at the Dongbianmen Water Gate into the Tonghui River, with a length of more than 7,000 meters. Along these 7,000-plus meters, there are more than 170 large and small sewage outlets. If the upstream of this river had a sufficient water volume to regularly inject and flush, the impact of these sewage discharges on environmental hygiene would not be significant. However, due to the poor water supply from the Yuquan Mountain source upstream and years of disrepair, most of the riverbed is silted up, turning this river into a drainage channel for sewage, or rather, a large open ditch. Coupled with residents along the river casually dumping sewage, the river channel has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and a source of infectious diseases. During the reactionary government's rule, no one paid attention to these issues, and no one thought about the health of the tens of thousands of working people along the river. Now, the People's Government has formulated a systematic city-wide river and lake dredging plan based on specific conditions, and this river is also part of the dredging effort. The Sanitary Engineering Bureau has, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Government, started work on March 1st to dredge the section of the river from the Qianmen East Water Gate to Dongbianmen.
　　In addition to dredging the riverbed (bottom) and adjusting the slope appropriately, this dredging project of the Qian Sanmen Moat will also widen the river channel in some areas where it has been narrowed by garbage blockage. At the same time, a sluice gate will be added at the Xibianmen Water Gate, where the West Moat enters the city, so that the section of the West Moat from Xizhimen to outside Xibianmen will regularly store clean water and periodically open the gate to flush the Qian Sanmen Moat river channel within the city, ensuring that no sewage remains in the city. This will not only change the city's environmental hygiene, but also solve the sewage drainage problem. The entire dredging plan was originally scheduled to start on March 1st, but because farmers in the 13th District lacked fertilizer before the Spring Festival and requested the government to start work during the agricultural slack season, the government advanced the start of the section from outside Dongbianmen to Qingfeng Gate based on this request. It took a total of three days to complete it before the Lunar New Year. In order to cooperate with the dredging project of the Three Seas and facilitate drainage, work has now continued on the section from Dongbianmen to the Qianmen East Water Gate.
　　The biggest difficulty after the start of the project was how to quickly drain the river water and reduce the inflow of upstream water. To solve this problem, the first step was to clear the Dongbianmen Water Gate outlet, which had not been dredged for thirteen years. The "Water Gate" is a hole left under the city wall for drainage, with iron grates both inside and outside. Each iron bar is more than three inches in diameter and very strong, making it impossible to open. The gaps in the middle are also difficult for people to squeeze through. Because it hadn't been dredged for more than a decade, the cave was filled with mud, weeds, and water, reaching half a person's depth. In addition, there had been some strange rumors about this cave in the past, and people were hesitant to enter. Li Changlu, the captain of the West Zhongjie team and a rickshaw puller, saw this situation and resolutely took off his clothes and squeezed through the iron grate. After clearing the water gate, the drainage problem was solved. But the next thing to solve was the blockage of the outlets of the Yuhe Underground Ditch, Suzhou Hutong, and Paozi River. These outlets were all major trunk ditches with a large amount of outflow, and several attempts to block them all failed. Finally, methods such as blocking during the day, releasing water after work in the evening, and adding sub-ditches (drainage ditches) were used, and work could barely be carried out. After overcoming these two difficulties, the project gradually unfolded according to plan.
　　Most of those participating in this dredging project were farmers from the 13th District, about 2,200 people. They were divided into eight teams based on the location of their homes and worked in eight sections. The teams were further divided into groups, each with twelve to fifteen people, who elected their own group leader and team leader. They were all organized by the district government, and most of them had participated in the upstream dredging project of the Tonghui River before the Spring Festival and had some experience in digging rivers. The leadership adopted a system of tiered responsibility. The construction site did not directly command the workers or assign tasks to the workers, but rather went through the team leaders and group leaders, which avoided the chaotic phenomenon of workers being overwhelmed. Any deviations found during the work could also be corrected immediately. The division of labor between the construction site and the district government was as follows: the district government was responsible for issuing wages and organizing workers, while the construction site was responsible for technical guidance, which saved the engineers and supervisors a lot of energy and allowed them to focus on the progress of the project and the promotion of the plan. The organization and propaganda group of the Sanitary Engineering Bureau often used free time to explain the significance of digging the river and how the project would be implemented in order to strengthen worker education and improve workers' technical knowledge and work enthusiasm.
　　During the project, some teams had experienced the deviation of wage egalitarianism, which was promptly corrected. Now, some teams have adopted the method of dividing the wages equally and then taking out the remainder to publicly reward workers who are active and perform well. Some team leaders and group leaders also adopted the attitude of "foremen" in the past, walking around, strolling around, pointing and shouting, leaving the workers at a loss. At the cadres' meeting, the district government proposed corrections and mobilized team leaders and group leaders to take the lead in doing the work.
　　Although there are still many difficulties in the work, especially in recent days when the weather has been cold and the ice formed by the soil and water of the riverbed and river channel has not yet melted, this has not hindered the progress of the project. The workers have linked this project to the welfare of the working people themselves, and they are generally very active. It is estimated that this project will be completed today (the 10th).

　　前三门护城河东段的疏浚工程
    向勃
    前三门护城河的上游是西护城河，由西便门水关进城，沿宣武门、前门、崇文门出东便门水关入通惠河，长七千余公尺。在这七千多公尺中，共有一百七十多个大小下水道排水口。假如这条河上游能有充分的水量经常注入冲刷，这些污水的灌入对环境卫生的影响是不大的；但由于上游玉泉山水源供水贫乏及河道多年失修，大部淤塞，使这条河变成了一条又臭又脏的下水道的排水渠，或者说是一条大的明沟。再加以沿河住户随便倾倒污水，使河道成了蚊虫的滋生所在，传染病的发生根源。在反动政府统治时期，是没有人注意这些，没有人想到沿河成万劳动人民的健康的。现在人民政府已经根据具体情况拟定了系统的全市河湖疏浚计划，这一条河也是疏浚的一部分；卫生工程局已经遵照市府的指示，从三月一日起开工掏挖前门迤东水关到东便门一段河道。
    这次前三门护城河的疏浚工程，除了将河床（河底）疏浚、坡度调整合适外，并将部分被垃圾堵塞，河道变窄地方重新展宽。同时并在西护城河入城地方——西便门水关，添设水闸，使西直门到西便门外的西护城河段，经常存贮净水，按时提闸冲刷城内前三门护城河河道，保证城内不存污水。这样不单市内环境卫生随之改变，下水道排水问题也获解决。整个疏浚计划原定三月一日开工，但是因为春节前十三区农民缺少肥料，要求政府利用农闲动工，政府根据这项要求便将东便门外到庆丰闸段提前开工。共用了三天功夫于旧历年前已完竣。为了配合三海的疏浚工程，易于泄水，现已继续在东便门至前门迤东水关段开工。
    工程开始后最大的困难是如何引导河水迅速排出与减少上游来水。解决这个问题，首先要将十三年没有掏挖过的东便门水关出水口挖通。“水关”就是为泄水在城墙下留的洞口，内外都有铁篦，每根铁条直径有三寸多，十分坚固，无法打开，中间空隙也很难钻过人去。由于十几年来没有掏挖，洞中积满污泥、乱草，连泥带水有半人多深。再加以对这个洞过去曾有一些奇奇怪怪的谣传，人们都踌躇不敢进入。西中街队队长三轮车工人李长禄见到这情况，便毅然脱光衣服，从铁篦缝中挤了进去。挖通水关以后，排水问题解决了。但跟着要解决的是御河暗沟口、苏州胡同、泡子河等出水口的堵塞工作。这几个出水口都是主要的干沟，出水量很多，几次堵塞工作全都失败。最后用白天堵上、晚上下工放水和添挖子沟（泄水沟）等方法，总算可以勉强工作了。这两个困难克服后，工程就按照计划逐步展开。
    参加这次疏浚工程的，大部是十三区的农民，约有二千二百余人。按他们住家的地点分为八个队，分在八个段工作。队的下面编为小组，每组十二人到十五人，自己选出组长和队长。他们都是经过区政府组织起来的，其中大部参加过春节前通惠河上游的疏浚工程，对挖河有些经验。领导是采取分层负责的制度。施工所不直接指挥工人或向工人布置工作，一切都通过队长、组长，这样避免了工人手忙脚乱的混乱现象，工作当中发现偏差也可即时纠正。施工所与区政府的分工是：发放工款与组织工人由区政府负责，技术指导由施工所负责，这样使得工程师及监工人员节省很大精力，可以全力放在工程的进行与计划的推动上。卫生工程局的组宣组，为了加强工人教育，提高工人技术知识和工作情绪，常利用空暇讲述挖河的意义及工程如何实施等。
    在工程进行当中，有的队曾发生过工资平均主义的偏向，已及时纠正，现在有的队已采用工款平分后，将尾数拿出当众奖给工作积极，成绩好的工人的办法。还有部分队长、组长，曾以过去“当工头”的态度，东走走，西遛遛，指指喊喊，使工人不知所措。在干部会上，区政府提出纠正，并动员队长、组长带头动手工作。
    虽然工作中还有许多困难，尤其是近几天来天气较冷，河床及河槽的土水凝成的冰块还没有溶化，但这并未妨碍了工程的进行。工人们已把这项工程和劳动人民自身的福利联系起来了，一般地都十分积极。预计这项工程今（十日）天即可完工。
