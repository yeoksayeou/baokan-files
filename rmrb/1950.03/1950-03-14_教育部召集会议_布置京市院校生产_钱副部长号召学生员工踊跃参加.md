　　Ministry of Education Convened a Meeting
    To Deploy Production in Beijing Universities
    Vice Minister Qian Calls on Students and Staff to Participate Enthusiastically
    [This newspaper reports] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a preparatory meeting for production in Beijing's colleges and universities on the morning of the 13th of this month in the conference room of the ministry. Those present included the deans, secretaries-general, heads of student unions of various colleges and universities in Beijing, as well as representatives from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, totaling more than 50 people. At the meeting, Vice Minister Qian Junrui of the ministry first spoke. He explained that given the current financial difficulties of the country, the students' lives are relatively hard, their nutrition is insufficient, and their living conditions need to be improved. There are two ways to improve this situation: the first is to increase people's scholarships and raise salaries, which is not possible at present; the second is for everyone to engage in production themselves. He then referred to the experiences of the old liberated areas and the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War, proving that it is possible to improve living standards through production in schools. Secondly, he emphasized that production can not only improve living standards, but also strengthen the body and enhance the concept of labor. Therefore, production should be an important part of the educational curriculum. Finally, he called on all students and staff with a general level of health to voluntarily and enthusiastically participate in the production front, to create wealth for society, improve their own lives, and to overcome the many difficulties in production with a fighting spirit. Afterwards, Comrade Zhao Fan of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party introduced the experience of how to solve various difficulties in organizing production. Then, everyone discussed how to organize mobilization and overcome difficulties, and decided that each university should immediately organize a production committee to mobilize and organize students and staff to immediately start planting vegetables, and immediately begin to acquire land, prepare agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers and other work. The meeting adjourned at half past twelve.

    钱副部长号召学生员工踊跃参加
    【本报讯】中央人民政府教育部本月十三日上午于该部会议室召开京市专科以上各院校生产筹备会议。到会有各院校教务长、秘书长、学生会负责人及中共北京市委会、北京市新民主主义青年团工作委员会等单位代表，共五十余人。会上首先由该部钱俊瑞副部长讲话。他说明在目前国家财政困难的情况下，同学们的生活较苦，营养不够，生活需要改善。改善办法有两个：第一是增加人民助学金，提高薪给，这在目前办不到，第二是大家动手搞生产。继而他根据过去老解放区和苏联在伟大爱国自卫战争时期的经验证明在学校中用生产改善生活是可能的。其次他着重指出生产不但可以改善生活，而且可以锻炼身体，加强劳动观念。因此生产要作为教育业务内容重要的一部分。最后他号召一切有一般健康水平的学生员工，志愿地踊跃参加生产战线，为社会创造财富，改善自己的生活，并用战斗的精神克服生产中的许多困难。继由中共北京市委会赵凡同志，介绍如何解决组织生产中各种困难的经验，接着大家讨论了如何组织动员与克服困难的办法等问题，决定各大学立即组织生产委员会，动员和组织学生和员工，立即动手种菜，并立即着手领土地，制备农具、籽种、肥料等工作。会议至十二时半始散。
