Tax Revenue Increases Month by Month

Key is the Responsible and Conscientious Tax Workers

[This newspaper dispatch] Since its establishment in November last year, the Tianjin Third Tax Bureau has conscientiously grasped tax work, ensuring the collection of all due taxes, and striving to simplify the tax system and collection procedures to achieve fair and reasonable burdens. It has achieved considerable success in four months. From the perspective of tax revenue figures, the actual revenue in December last year exceeded the budget by 86 percent, and the revenue in January this year increased by 105 percent compared to December. If the temporary income of salt merchants' excessive profit tax in that month is excluded, it still increased by 33 percent compared to December. February only had 28 days, including four days of Spring Festival holidays. In addition, merchants did little business around the Spring Festival, and there were few major transactions before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. However, according to preliminary statistics, the revenue in February is no less than the equivalent of January's revenue in terms of millet.

Several major items of the bureau's regular income: such as the business tax, increased by 116 percent in December compared to November, and by 28 percent in January compared to December. Wharf usage fees increased by 110 percent in December compared to November, and by 44 percent in January compared to December. Since December, the revenue has far exceeded the revenue of any previous month last year. Stamp tax increased by 68 percent in January compared to December, exceeding the city's stamp tax revenue in any previous month. For example, June of last year was the peak period for stamp tax revenue, but the bureau's revenue in January exceeded that of June last year by 42 percent. In terms of business tax, the number of withholding merchants in the third bureau's jurisdiction only accounts for one-third of the city's total withholding households, but the business tax revenue in January is already close to the city's total revenue of this tax in ordinary months. (The above-mentioned percentage increases are all calculated in terms of millet.)

In-depth Inspection to Develop Tax Sources and Collect All Due Taxes

The reason for the increase in tax revenue is mainly due to the bureau's in-depth work, discovering problems, developing tax sources, and collecting all due taxes.

In November last year, in view of the large loopholes in the stamp tax and business tax in the past, inspections of these two taxes were launched. In terms of business tax, it was discovered that the Western medicine industry in District 1 was failing to withhold business tax when purchasing goods from merchants. With the assistance of the industry association, a declaration and tax payment was conducted, totaling 81,608,472 yuan. Before the inspection, the daily revenue in District 1 was 6-7 million yuan, but after the inspection, it rose daily to 14-15 million yuan by the end of November. Before the inspection, the daily revenue in District 4 was 2-300,000 yuan, but after the inspection, it increased to 7-800,000 yuan. In addition, it was discovered that the pig bristle company was failing to withhold tax on the purchase of goods from merchants. Collection began on December 26, with an average daily revenue of about 2 million yuan, and a revenue of 60,412,690 yuan in January. Among the 125 customs declaration companies in the city, 48 declared tax evasion, totaling 36,263,320 yuan in back taxes. Since then, customs declaration companies have often come to the bureau to inquire about tax withholding matters. In terms of stamp tax, in a demonstration inspection in District 1, 48 households were inspected, and a total of 63 violations were discovered through horizontal inspection. Among them, in addition to the Daye Cotton Cloth Shop, which established accounts before and after, and still refused to tell the truth after education, the evaded stamp tax was fined 50 times and 40 times respectively, totaling 4,039,850 yuan. For general merchants, education was conducted, new stamp tax schedules and tax rates were widely distributed, publicity was conducted by industry, and a regular inspection system was established in each district. Tax revenue rose daily. For example, before the inspection, the daily revenue in District 1 was about 6 million yuan, and the revenue in District 4 was more than 300,000 yuan. By the end of November, District 1 increased to more than 10 million yuan per day, and District 4 increased to more than 700,000 yuan.

Tax Evaders Actively Pay Back Taxes, Resulting in Daily Revenue Increases - Tax Evasion Phenomena Still Exist, Further Improvements Should be Made

As the work gradually deepened, some previously unnoticed loopholes were discovered. For example, the English names of lists (Invoices) used in the import and export industry are in fact the nature of shipping invoices, which have been missed in the past. After the bureau repeatedly explained the significance of the stamp tax and presented the legal basis and specific opinions to the superior for consideration, the Finance Committee approved the following method for paying back taxes: Those who missed sticking before June 10 will be calculated and paid back in RMB according to the exchange rate at the time of export. Those who missed sticking after June 10 will be paid back according to the exchange rate on December 25. After December 25, it will be calculated according to the exchange rate on the day of tax evasion, and must be paid in full by the end of February. As of the end of February, 412 households have paid back taxes of 2,721,067,534 yuan.

In January, inspections were also conducted on the securities, import and export, banking, and warehouse industries. In addition to the missing stamps on import and export lists, there were also several types of documents in the securities industry that were not stamped due to unclear nature. Banks automatically listed all vouchers and came to the bureau to inquire about stamping methods. Only the stamping situation in the warehouse industry was extremely chaotic. After the consignment of goods was sold, most of them did not issue invoices, did not issue silver money receipts, and did not issue receipts for commissions and rent received from each household, or the receipts were not stamped. The settlement statements were also not stamped as required. After inspection, only eight households such as Meifeng Hou and Xinsheng He paid back taxes of 83,842,213 yuan. Among them, Meifeng Hou alone paid back more than 15 million yuan.

When collecting the property tax for the second half of 1949, it was found that in the past, there were a total of 35,261.5 rooms of undeclared houses and 4,542.5 rooms of falsely reported grades, equivalent to 756,836.86 jin of millet. According to the statistics of the first, fifth, and tenth districts alone, the increased income was a total of 290,700 jin of millet.

In terms of banquet, entertainment, and slaughter taxes, the revenue has also increased. Only in the banquet tax, after calling for declaration and back payment, 51 households made declarations, and the total tax payable was 16,529,695 yuan.

From the above problems, although there are reasons such as adjusting tax rates (such as stamp tax) that increase tax revenue, the adjustment of the starting point for business tax and stamp tax reduces revenue. The continuous increase in revenue of the bureau in recent months is mainly due to in-depth work, discovery of problems, responsible and conscientious cadres, and in-depth publicity. At present, the phenomenon of stealing and evading taxes is still quite prevalent in individual industries. In the future, we must continue to vigorously carry out publicity and education work, so that everyone can deeply understand the spirit of taxation and consciously abide by it. In addition, we must also strengthen inspection work, so that those illegal merchants who disregard national tax revenue and seek personal gain will be supervised by the masses and sanctioned by government laws. In terms of tax work, we should simplify procedures, facilitate merchants and benefit the people, and strive to achieve fair and reasonable burdens. (Li Zhouxing)

　　天津市第三税务分局
    税收数字逐月增加
    关键是税收工作者认真负责
    【本报讯】天津税务第三分局自去年十一月成立以来，认真掌握税收工作，把应收的税保证收齐，努力做到简化税制及稽征手续，达到负担的公平合理，四个月中获得了不少成绩。从税收数字上看，去年十二月份的实际收入超过预算的百分之八十六，今年一月份收入较十二月份又增加百分之一百○五。如把该月临时收入之盐商过份利得税除外，仍较十二月增加百分之三十三。二月份只有二十八天，其中有四天春节放假，加以商人春假前后不作生意，旧历正月十五以前大项交易很少，但二月份收入根据初步统计，并不少于一月份之收入折米数字。
    分局经常收入几个主要项目：如行商税，十二月份收入较十一月增加百分之一百一十六，一月份收入较十二月增加百分之二十八。码头使用费十二月较十一月增加百分之一百一十，一月较十二月增加百分之四十四。自十二月起，收入已远超过去年任何月份之收入。印花税一月份较十二月增加百分之六十八。超过过去历月全市印花税的收入。如去年六月份为印花税收入最旺时，但该分局一月份收入即较去年六月超过百分之四十二。行商税方面，三分局辖区内代扣商户只占全市代扣户的三分之一，但一月份行商税收入已快赶上过去普通月份全市该税收入。（以上所谓增加百分之几都是以小米计算）
  深入检查开辟税源把应收的税都收齐
    税收所以增加，主要是该分局深入工作，发现问题，开辟税源，把应收的税都能收齐。
    去年十一月里因鉴于过去印花、行商二税的漏洞很大，展开了这两种税的检查工作。在行商方面，发现了一区西药业收买行商货物漏扣行商税。在该业公会协助下，进行了申报补税，共补八一、六○八、四七二元。一区在检查前每日收入六七百万元，检查后至十一月底逐日上升达一千四五百万元。四区检查前由每日收入二三十万元，检查后增为七八十万元。此外又发现猪鬃公司收买行商货物未扣税。于十二月二十六日开始征收，每日收入平均二百万元左右。一月份收入六○、四一二、六九○元。全市报关业一二五户中，申报漏税者四十八户，共补税三六、二六三、三二○元。自此后报关业常有人来局询问扣税事宜。印花税方面，在一区示范检查中，检查了四十八户，由于横线检查，共发现六十三个违章案件，其中除大业棉布庄设立前后帐，经教育后仍坚不吐实，漏印花税分别处以五十倍及四十倍之罚金四、○三九、八五○元外，对一般商户则进行教育，并广泛发给新印花税税目税率表，分行业进行宣传，并在各区树立经常检查制度，税收逐日上升，如在检查前一区每日收入六百万元左右，四区收入三十余万元。至十一月底一区增为每日一千余万元，四区增为七十余万元。
    漏税户纷纷补缴使收入逐日上升  漏税现象还不少应再改进
    由于工作的逐渐深入，发现了过去一些没有注意到的漏洞。又如进出口业所用之清单英名（Invoice）即是发货票性质，过去一直漏花。后经该局再三解释印花税之意义，并提出法令根据与具体意见呈请上级考虑，后经财委会批准按下列办法补税：凡在六月十日以前漏贴者按出口当时外汇牌价折成人民币计算补税，六月十日以后漏贴者按十二月二十五日牌价补税。十二月二十五日以后则按漏税当日牌价折合计算，限二月底补齐。截至二月底，已有四一二户补税二、七二一、○六七、五三四元。
    一月份又进行了证券、出进口、银钱、货栈等四业的检查，除进出口清单漏花外，证券业也有几类单据因性质不明未贴花，银行自动将所有凭证列表来局询问贴花办法，唯有货栈业贴花情形极为紊乱，代客卖货成交后，大部不开发票，不开银钱收据，收到各户佣金栈租也不开收据，或开据不贴花，结帐单也未按规定贴花，经检查仅美丰厚、新盛和等八户即补税八三、八四二、二一三元。其中仅美丰厚一户即补一千五百余万。
    在征收一九四九年下半年房捐工作时，查出过去漏报房屋的，据不完全统计共三五、二六一·五间，虚报等级四、五四二·五间，折米七五六、八三六·八六斤。仅据一、五、十区三个所的统计，增加收入共小米二九○、七○○斤。
    在筵席、娱乐、屠宰等税方面，收入均有增加。仅筵席税在号召申报补税后，有五十一户进行申报，应纳税款共一六、五二九、六九五元。
    从上面的问题看，虽然有调整税率（如印花税）等原因使税收增加，但行商、印花税等起征点的调整则使收入减少。该分局几个月来收入能够不断增涨，主要仍由于工作深入，发现问题，干部认真负责，宣传的深入。目前个别行业中，偷漏的情形仍相当普遍的存在着，今后必须继续大力展开宣传教育工作，使大家深刻了解税收精神，自觉遵守。另外也必须加强稽查工作，使那些不顾国家税收，贪图私利的不法商人，受到群众的监督及政府法令的制裁。在税收工作方面则应简化手续，便商利民，尽量做到负担公平合理。（李周行）
