　　Tito Sells Out National Resources
    In Exchange for a New American Loan
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: Washington Dispatch: The U.S. Export-Import Bank granted Tito a new loan of twenty million U.S. dollars on the first of the month. This loan was begged for by Tito from the United States last December. According to a French Press Agency dispatch from the first of the month, quoting Gaston, president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank: Yugoslavia will use the loan to purchase raw materials and manufactured goods from the United States, and in 1950 will export raw materials such as steel, zinc, and lead to the United States worth thirty million to thirty-five million U.S. dollars. A Telepress Agency message pointed out: This loan illustrates that the United States is prepared to intensify the establishment of a war base in Yugoslavia, and at the same time, Yugoslavia's debt to the United States has made American monopoly capitalists the de facto masters of Yugoslavia's natural resources. American newspapers also openly stated when commenting on the loan: "In terms of obtaining super-profits in colonies, Yugoslavia is one of the best investment locations."

　　铁托出卖国家资源
    换得美一笔新贷款
    【新华社北京七日电】华盛顿讯：美国进出口银行一日贷予铁托一笔新贷款，总数为二千万美元。这笔贷款是铁托在去年十二月间向美国乞求的。据法新社一日电引美国进出口银行总裁加斯顿表示：南斯拉夫将以贷款向美国购买原料和生产品，而在一九五○年对美输出价值三千万到三千五百万美元的钢、锌、铅等原料。电通社消息指出：这次贷款说明美国准备加紧建立南斯拉夫的战争基地，同时南斯拉夫欠美国的债务已使美国垄断资本家成为南斯拉夫天然富源的实际主人。美国报纸评论贷款时也公开表示：“就以在殖民地获取超额利润而言，南斯拉夫是最好的投资地之一。”
