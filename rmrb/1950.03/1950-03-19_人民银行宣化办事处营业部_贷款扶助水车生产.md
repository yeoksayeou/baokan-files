　　People's Bank of Xuanhua Office Business Department
    Loans to Support Waterwheel Production
    [This Newspaper] The People's Bank of Xuanhua Office Business Department loaned 120 million yuan to support the Chahar Agricultural Implement Factory in producing waterwheels, in order to develop agricultural production. The Chahar Agricultural Implement Factory has more than 60 employees, specializing in manufacturing agricultural implements such as waterwheels, plowshares, hoes, and iron shovels. Previously, the factory was commissioned by the Zhangjiakou Water Conservancy Promotion Society to make 100 waterwheels. Due to lack of funds, it was unable to purchase raw materials, and had requested a loan from the Xuanhua Bank Business Department. In order to support agricultural production, the department granted two loans of 120 million yuan (including 53,200 jin of millet calculated at its cash value) around February. The Chahar Agricultural Implement Factory used these funds to purchase 10,000 jin of three-point round iron, 71 tons of scrap iron from machinery, 31 tons of coke, 221 sheets of lead-iron plate, and all kinds of miscellaneous raw materials from Beijing. Construction of waterwheels began on March 4, and more than 40 waterwheels have now been completed.

    贷款扶助水车生产
    【本报讯】人民银行宣化办事处营业部贷款一亿二千万元，扶植察南农具厂生产水车，以发展农业生产。察南农具厂共有职工六十余人，专制水车、犁铧、锄头、铁锹等农具。该厂前为张家口水利推进社定做水车一百辆，因资金缺乏，无力购买原料，曾向宣化银行营业部要求贷款。该部为扶植农业生产，于二月份前后二次贷给人民币一亿二千万元（内有折实小米五万三千二百斤）。察南农具厂乃利用此项资金，由北京购买三分圆铁一万斤，机器废铁七十一吨，焦炭三十一吨，铅铁板二百二十一张及一切零星原料材料。于三月四日开工制造水车，现已做好四十余辆。
