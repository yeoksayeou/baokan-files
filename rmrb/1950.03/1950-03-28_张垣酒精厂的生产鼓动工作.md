　　Production Mobilization Work at Zhangyuan Alcohol Factory
　　·Hu Zhe·
　　From the moment you enter the gate of the alcohol factory until you reach the last workshop, you get a significant feeling: the propaganda and mobilization work of the alcohol factory is closely integrated with production. The raw materials department has written on the large white wall facing you:
　　“Shake the cart diligently, prepare the materials carefully,
　　Don't waste a single grain!"
　　The boiler room also prominently displays:
　　“Watch the fire diligently, burn carefully,
　　Save coal and report the merits!”
　　The factory has established eight blackboards in six workshops, each recording new production achievements in a timely manner to encourage the production enthusiasm of the workers. For example:
　　“Look!
　　On the evening of the 24th, comrades Zhang Zhicheng, Zhang Yuxi, and Sun Tingku of the distillation room, worked together, operated carefully, and extracted 98.4 catties of alcohol from every ten stones of mash (the previous record was 90 catties).
　　Comrades, rise up! Strive for 27,000 catties of alcohol!"
　　The factory compiles production news into a quick report every day and writes it on the blackboard. If the production target is completed or exceeded, or a new record is broken, a bulletin of victory and a wall newspaper are immediately published. Even at twelve o'clock at night, efforts must be made to post the bulletin of victory, or it must be posted before the workers go to work the next day, so that the workers can get new strength to encourage everyone's production mood when they go to work in the morning. For example, the production bulletin of victory on March 5th was written like this:
　　“Create! Create! Create again!
　　New! New! New again!
　　To celebrate the successful conclusion of the Party Congress,
　　1305 catties of alcohol were produced on March 5th, with a product rate of 28.37%.
　　We must strive for more and higher new records."
　　The factory also has a production increase/decrease chart and a defect statistics chart, marking the daily production quantity of each machine or each person with red and blue lines, so everyone is concerned about their own production performance. When the production numbers increase, the whole team is very excited; if the production numbers suddenly decrease, everyone actively studies the reasons, which greatly promotes production.
　　It can be seen from the above the importance of production mobilization work. But what experience does it give us?
　　1. With the launch of the production movement, production mobilization work must keep up closely. The form of propaganda should be lively, diverse, and concise. Once established, it must be improved and consolidated.
　　2. As the movement continues to move forward, there will be many praiseworthy deeds in each workshop or department every day. For this reason, cultural and educational officers must be established in each trade union group, and a cultural and educational committee must be established to be responsible for the propaganda and mobilization work of each workshop in a unified manner. The committee members also have clear and specific division of labor, and carry out work separately under unified leadership and planning.
　　3. To do a good job in production mobilization work, the first decision depends on the importance attached to it by the leading cadres of the Party, government, and trade union, and at the same time, it should be closely integrated with the production cadres. For example, the factory's production mobilization work is very active because the leaders' thinking is clear and unified and all aspects actively cooperate. The factory director also takes the lead and often writes articles himself. The head of the engineering section is the trade union's blackboard newspaper officer, and he publishes the production figures and production realities he has mastered on the blackboard newspaper in a timely manner.

　　张垣酒精厂的生产鼓动工作
    ·胡哲·
    从走进酒精厂大门直到最后一个工作室，给人们一个显著的感觉：酒精厂的宣传鼓动工作和生产是密切结合着的。原料部在迎面大白墙上写着：
     “勤摇车，细造料，
     一粒粮食也不丢掉！”
    锅炉房也在显著的地位写着：
    “勤看火，细心烧，
    节省煤，报功劳！”
    该厂六个工作室里建立了八块黑板报，每块黑板报上都及时的记载着新的生产成绩，以鼓舞工友们的生产热情。例如：
    “请看！
    二十四日晚，蒸馏室张志诚、张玉喜、孙廷库三同志，同心协力，细心操作，每十石醪流出酒精九八·四斤（过去最高纪录九十斤）。
    同志们，起来！为两万七千斤酒精而奋斗！”
    该厂每天把生产中的消息，编成快报，写在黑板上。如果完成与超过了生产任务，或突破了新纪录，马上出喜报、出墙报，即使在夜间十二时，也得争取把喜报贴出去，或在第二天工人上班之前一定要贴好，使工人早晨上班时，能得到鼓励大家生产的情绪的新力量。例如三月五日的生产喜报是这样写的：
    “创！创！再创！
    新！新！再新！
    为庆祝党代会议胜利的成功，
    三月五日产酒精一三○五斤，产品率为百分之二八·三七。
    我们要争取更多更高的新纪录。”
    该厂并设有生产升降表和废品统计表，把每天每台机器或每一个人的生产数量，用红蓝线标帜着，所以每一个人都关心着他自己的生产成绩。生产数字增加了，同班都非常兴奋；如果生产数字突然降低了，大伙就积极研究原因，推动生产的力量很大。
    从上面可以看出生产鼓动工作的重要性。但它给我们一些什么经验呢？
    一、随着生产运动的发动，生产鼓动工作就必须紧紧赶上去。宣传形式要活泼、多样、简明，既经建立，则必须健全与巩固起来。
    二、当运动继续向前发展，每个车间或部门，每天都会有很多值得表扬的事迹。为此必须在每一个工会小组内建立文教干事，成立文教委员会，统一负责各车间的宣传鼓动工作。各委员间并有明确具体分工，在统一领导和计划下，分别进行工作。
    三、要做好生产鼓动工作，首先决定于党政工领导干部的重视，同时，并应和生产干部密切结合。例如该厂由于领导思想明确统一，各方面积极配合，所以生产鼓动工作非常活跃。该厂长并起带头作用，经常自己写稿。工务科长是工会黑板报干事，他将所掌握的生产数字及生产实情及时的在黑板报公布出来。
