Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 17th: The direct units of the Southwest Military Region, responding to the call of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have more deeply implemented the streamlining and thrift campaign. According to incomplete statistics, in the past month, the direct units of the military region have streamlined over a thousand cadres and staff members to strengthen grassroots work or participate in local work, and released 798 military horses to replenish transportation institutions. Since the People's Liberation Army entered Chongqing, some cadres in the agencies have had erroneous ideas such as departmentalism and emphasis on enjoyment. There were many people eating but few working in the agencies, bringing the loose work and lifestyle of the countryside to the city, and there were even instances of extravagance and waste. In response to this situation, the leading officers of various departments of the military region established streamlining committees, and the Military Administration Department of the headquarters specially added a barrack property management section to stipulate a standard of three cubic meters of housing per person for general staff, and first adjusted housing. Before the adjustment, ideological mobilization was carried out, and the slogans of "three comparisons" (comparing with comrades at the front, comparing with disaster-stricken people, and comparing with units with poor housing) and "three preparations" (preparing for no water and electricity, no furniture, and preparing to sleep on the floor) were put forward. In adjusting the structure and streamlining personnel, everyone was called upon to assume the task of being a fighting force and a working force forever, with one person doing the work of three; not only to reduce expenses to "cut expenditures," but also to find ways to carry out production to "increase revenue." Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Jichun, Li Da and other generals of the Southwest Military Region took the lead by setting an example and not establishing official residences. Under the personal leadership and exemplary role of the leaders of the military region, all units launched in-depth inspections. In adjusting housing, they were able to adhere to the principle of "squeezing" to free up some housing for other units to live in. With the adjustment and concentration of housing in various units, the catering units were also merged. The headquarters and the Military Administration Department merged seven canteens into two, reducing 219 service and miscellaneous personnel. At the same time, a collective office system was established, stipulating that units below the section level should not set up separate offices, and the heads of each department should also work together in a centralized manner. This not only reduced unnecessary personnel and improved work efficiency, but also greatly saved on material resources. After the Cipher Department changed from decentralized office to collective office, the original 24 messengers were reduced to only 11. In early February, all units responded more enthusiastically to the call to save expenses, actively participating in various labor and transportation work, carrying rice and firewood themselves, seven or eight li for those nearby, and more than ten li for those far away; in addition, they also participated in the construction of roads and the repair of houses and furniture, saving a great deal of expenses. The Logistics Department's Transport Regiment built its own sheds, saving 1.6 billion yuan. Now, according to the State Council's instructions on unifying national financial and economic work, all units are further carrying out inspections and streamlining work.

　　西南军区直属队实行整编节约
    工作效率显著提高
    【新华社重庆十七日电】西南军区直属队响应中共中央西南局的号召，更深入地贯彻了整编节约工作。一个月来据不完全统计，军区直属队共精简干部和工作人员千余人用以加强基层工作或参加地方工作，腾出军马七百九十八匹，补充到运输机构里去。自解放军进驻重庆以来，某些机关干部曾存在有本位主义、讲享受等错误思想，机关内吃饭人多，做事人少，把农村散漫的工作、生活方式搬到城市，个别还有铺张浪费的现象。针对这种情况，军区各部负责首长成立了整编委员会，司令部军政处特别增设营房财产管理科，规定一般人员住房每人三方公尺的标准，首先进行调整房屋。在调整前，进行了思想动员，提出了“三比”（与前方同志比，与受灾人民比，与房子差的单位比）和“三准备”（准备没有水电、家具和准备睡地板）的口号。在调整机构精简人员中，号召大家担负起永远是战斗队同时又是工作队的任务，一个人要做三个人的事；不仅要减少开支来“节流”，同时要设法进行生产来“开源”。西南军区首长刘伯承、邓小平、张际春、李达诸将军首先以身作则，不设公馆。在军区首长的亲自领导和模范作用下，各单位都展开了深入的检查，在调整房屋时，都能本着“挤一挤”的原则，腾出一些房屋来让别的单位住。随着各单位住房的调整和集中，伙食单位也进行了合并。司令部、军政处就由七个伙房合并为两个，减少了事务勤杂人员二百一十九名。同时又建立了集体办公制度，规定科以下单位不单设办公室，各部首长也都集中办公。这样，不仅减少了不必要的人员，提高了工作效率，同时在物力上也大大节省。机要处由分散办公改为集体办公后，原有通讯员二十四人，现在只用十一个人就行了。二月初各单位更热烈响应节省开支的号召，积极参加各种劳动和运输工作，自己背米、扛柴，近者七八里，远者十余里；此外，并参加修筑公路、修补房屋家具，都节省了一笔很大的开支。后勤部辎重团自己动手修建车棚，节省人民币十六亿。现在各单位根据政务院的统一国家财经工作的指示，进一步展开检查和整编工作。
