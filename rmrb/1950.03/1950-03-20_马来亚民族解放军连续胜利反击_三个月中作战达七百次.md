　　Malayan National Liberation Army Continues Victorious Counterattacks
　　700 Operations in Three Months
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch] The Malayan National Liberation Army is responding to the British colonial authorities' planned so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" with increasingly fierce counterattacks. According to British and American news agencies, late on the night of March 12th, the Malayan National Liberation Army surrounded and attacked security police stationed in northwestern Malaya, killing eight security police and "volunteers." On the 14th, the Liberation Army again attacked a police escort team in the Kuantan area of Pahang, killing four policemen. In the Ipoh area of Perak, the Liberation Army also raided a factory of the British colonialists. On the 16th, on the road from Kuala Lumpur to Bentong, the Liberation Army ambushed a British "Royal Film Company" camera crew that had come specifically to film British military operations, injuring seven cameramen and escorting police. According to the British Information Office: When British Colonial Secretary Dugdale reported on the situation in Malaya in the House of Commons on the 16th, he admitted that guerrilla forces and British troops had fought more than 700 times in the past three months. The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Singapore on the 14th, also believed that the Malayan guerrillas' series of victorious counterattacks were "a mockery of the British 'Anti-Bandit Month.'"
　　Due to repeated military defeats, Britain is withdrawing troops to reinforce Malaya. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Singapore on the 14th, Britain will withdraw the 26th Gurkha Infantry Brigade (an Indian mercenary force forcibly conscripted) from Hong Kong and the Royal Air Force's No. 57 Squadron "Lincoln" bombers from Britain to fight in Malaya. The latter took off on the 15th. Meanwhile, TASS, London, 16th dispatch quoting the "Daily Telegraph" reported: Among the more than 400,000 Malayan "volunteers" recently forcibly conscripted by the British colonial authorities, 25,000 have been forced to participate in the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" operations. After the "Anti-Bandit Month," they will continue to serve and be at the disposal of the authorities.

　　马来亚民族解放军连续胜利反击
    三个月中作战达七百次
    【新华社十九日讯】马来亚民族解放军正以愈来愈炽烈的反击，来回答英殖民当局策划的所谓“反匪月”。据英美通讯社消息，本月十二日深夜，马来亚民族解放军曾围袭驻扎马来亚西北部的保安警察，击毙保安警察及“志愿兵”八名。十四日，解放军复袭击在彭亨关丹地区的警察护送队，击毙警察四名。在霹雳怡保地区，解放军并突击了英殖民者的工厂。十六日，由吉隆坡去班通的路上，解放军伏击了专为摄取英军作战影片而来的英国“皇家影片公司”的摄影队，击伤摄影员及护送队警察七名。据英国新闻处讯：英殖民地事务大臣杜格达尔十六日在下院报告马来亚形势时，承认过去三个月中游击队和英军共作战七百次以上。美联社在新加坡十四日消息中也认为马来亚游击队一连串的胜利反击，“是对英国‘反匪月’的嘲笑”。
    由于军事上的不断遭受挫败，英国正在抽调兵力，增援马来亚。据美联社新加坡十四日消息，英国将从香港抽调第二十六廓尔卡步兵旅（按系被强迫征募的印度雇佣兵），从英国抽调皇家空军“林肯”号第五十七中队轰炸机，前往马来亚作战，后者已于十五日起飞。同时，据法斯社伦敦十六日电引“每日电讯”报道：英殖民当局最近强迫征调的四十余万马来亚“志愿军”中，已有两万五千人被迫参加所谓“反匪月”的作战。在“反匪月”结束后，他们仍将继续服役，听候调遣。
