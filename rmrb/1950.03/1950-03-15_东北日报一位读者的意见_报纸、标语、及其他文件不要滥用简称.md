　　An Opinion from a Reader of the Northeast Daily: Don't Misuse Abbreviations in Newspapers, Slogans, and Other Documents
    I read the article "On Correcting Several Technical Problems in News Writing" in the "News Work" section on page five of the January 4th People's Daily in Beijing. It explained the problems with using abbreviations in news and pointed out the necessity of "correcting this chaotic phenomenon in language and writing." However, we still frequently find such inappropriate abbreviations in newspapers or other documents. To give a few examples: in the "Social Services" section of the Northeast Daily on January 6th, there was a headline like "Artillery × Division Actively Participates in Labor, Dongrong Engineering Company Sends Letter of Thanks." Here, "Artillery × Division" originally refers to the Artillery Division No. ×, and "Dongrong Engineering Company" is the Northeast Veterans Engineering Company. If one does not see the full name of the organization later in the letter, it is easy to mistake Dongrong Engineering Company for an ordinary company name. Other examples include shortening "utilizing waste" to only "util-waste," and "economic construction" to only "econ-construct." Some work reports even abbreviate "education plan" to "edu-plan." Additionally, slogans printed by the Shenyang Municipal Government Health Bureau not only invented the incomprehensible abbreviation "fluid-brain" for "epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis," but also used incorrect punctuation, which easily leads to misunderstandings. The New Year's slogans screened at the Shenyang People's Cinema on New Year's Day wrote "Liberation warriors" instead of "People's Liberation Army soldiers," which greatly deviates from the original meaning. I suggest that comrades engaged in news and propaganda work pay attention to this phenomenon and correct it at any time.

### 东北日报一位读者的意见  报纸、标语、及其他文件不要滥用简称

　　东北日报一位读者的意见  报纸、标语、及其他文件不要滥用简称
    读一月四日北京人民日报第五版“新闻工作”有《关于纠正新闻文字中几种技术上的通病》一文，说明了新闻中使用简称等毛病所在，并指出“必须改正这种语言文字上的混乱现象”。但是这种不适当的简称，我们还随时在报纸上或其他文件上发现。随便举几个例子，如：一月六日东北日报“社会服务”中有这样的标题“炮×师积极参加劳动、东荣工程公司去函致谢”。这里的“炮×师”原是指炮兵第×师，“东荣工程公司”系东北荣誉军人工程公司。如不看书信后面机关全称，很容易把东荣工程公司当做一个普通的公司名称。其他如“利用废物”只写“利废”，“经济建设”只写“经建”；甚而有的工作报告中，把“教育计划”缩写为“教计”；其他像沈阳市政府卫生局印发的标语，不但把“流行性脑膜脊髓炎”杜撰不通地缩写为“流脑”，同时标点也点错，易使人发生误解。沈阳人民电影院元旦那天放映的新年标语中都把“解放军战士”写为“解放战士”，这就和原义大相迳庭。建议作新闻工作和宣传工作的同志们注意这种现象，随时纠正。
