　　On Truman's Plan for Developing Backward Areas
    By Luoka, translated by Fu Ying

    Comrade Luoka is the General Secretary of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba. This article exposes the economic aggression of American imperialism against Latin American countries and reveals the essence of Truman's Point Four Program. The original was translated from Spanish into English and published in the American Communist Party's organ "Political Monthly" last November.

    In his message to the US Congress on January 20, 1949, Truman, amidst shameless and loud slander against communism and the Soviet Union, put forward his "bold" plan, which he boasted would help develop backward areas of the world.

    This plan is the fourth point of the US President's proposed policy to the Congress for the United States "to fight against communism." Therefore, it is worth talking about the other three points as well.

    First, attacking the principle that resolutions of the United Nations Security Council require the unanimous consent of the five major powers; advocating taking steps to accept new countries that obey American commands as members of the United Nations, in order to expand American control over the United Nations General Assembly; and finally, turning the United Nations into a tool for the United States to carry out political aggression and seize world hegemony.

    Second, continue the Marshall Plan; strive to eliminate "obstacles" to international commerce, that is, to eliminate obstacles to American control of world trade.

    Third, ratify the North Atlantic Treaty and provide participating countries with credit loans to arm them.

    The "bold" plan in the fourth point to develop backward areas must be seen in close connection with the above three points. They are all parts of the same imperialist policy. This imperialist policy aims to seize world hegemony and prepare for a war to establish its world hegemony.

    In his message and in the propaganda of imperialist pawns everywhere, Truman made it sound as if the United States—the United States under the rule of monopoly capitalists—proposed to take responsibility for developing backward countries (these countries are backward precisely because of imperialist policies) in order to improve the living standards of their people.

    To make it sound believable, Truman described the economic situation of "backward countries" quite realistically. He said, "More than half of the people in the world live in poverty. They are hungry. They are plagued by disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty not only threatens themselves but also threatens the more prosperous regions." He then set the ostensible goal of this plan, carefully concealing the real purpose—exploitation and imperialist monopolization. The ostensible goal of this plan, according to him, is:

    "…We must embark on a new, bold program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas."

    These words have been proven to be lies by the daily realities we see in Latin American countries—the savage oppression and insatiable exploitation of South American countries by American monopoly capitalists and rulers—the United Fruit Company, Standard Oil, Chase Bank, stock brokerage firms, etc. Nevertheless, the major mouthpieces of the ruling classes of Latin American countries regard Truman's words as sincere and use Truman's words to justify American generosity and the altruism of American rulers.

    If actual behavior proves that what is said is a lie, then these words are not worth a penny.

    The purpose of Truman's plan to develop backward areas, which he has repeatedly stated, is proven to be a lie every day by the reality we experience in Latin American countries, and by the actions taken by the American government towards Latin America.

    What American imperialists and their government are trying to implement is openly contradictory to what they say they want to do: to "help" backward countries develop their economies, establish industries, and improve their living standards.

    American imperialists and the Truman government have interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American countries to maintain the semi-colonial economic system prevalent in Latin American countries, to thwart all attempts to develop independent economies, and to strengthen the monopoly of foreign capital over the markets and sources of raw materials of Latin American countries.

    The United States has used various pressures to prevent trade between Latin American countries, trade between them and European countries, and especially trade between them and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The purpose of all American efforts is to make the international trade of Latin American countries pass through or be controlled by American trusts and monopoly organizations; in this regard, they have achieved great success. Take Cuba, for example, when Cuba wanted to buy beef from Argentina, the American embassy threatened to ban Cuban products from being exported to the United States, because Argentine livestock suffered from foot-and-mouth disease. If Cuba bought Argentine beef, there was a risk of spreading the disease in the United States when Cuban products were imported into the United States. Cuba could not buy beef from Argentina. However, a few months later, the US Army announced the purchase of Argentine beef.

    The United States has used and is using all the methods at its disposal to undermine the efforts of Latin American countries to establish and develop their own shipping and air transport systems. To give an example. The Gran Colombia Merchant Marine Company, jointly founded by Venezuela, Ecuador, and Colombia, has been fiercely attacked by American shipping monopolies and American government agencies.

    Various minor industries newly established in some Latin American countries are constantly being hit by the United States. Many enterprises established by Latin American countries to diversify their production have been destroyed by the United States. For example, in Cuba, before the end of World War II, the US government proceeded to demolish the Nicarolo Nickel Company's factory, leaving two thousand workers unemployed. The same is true for factories that manufacture dried vegetables.

    The United States has used so-called international trade treaties to force Latin American countries to lower tariffs on American products; however, Latin American products are subject to American quotas and other restrictions.

    In Latin American countries, a small number of light industries that developed considerably during the war were destroyed by American monopoly enterprises using dumping methods. The packaging, glass, textile, leather, and shoe industries are examples of this. In Cuba, most textile factories were forced to close due to competition from American industries and textiles manufactured in Japan (occupied by the United States).

    The United States has never provided any financial assistance to Latin American countries to develop their domestic enterprises. On the contrary, the US government has used the financial needs of some countries to extort concessions that are extremely harmful to their economies and infringe upon their national sovereignty. For example, Mexico wanted to borrow money from the United States to improve its nationalized oil industry. In order to obtain this loan, Mexico promised to lease a rich oil field to Pauley (a close friend of Truman), so that he could facilitate the matter. US government officials hinted that the fact that the Mexican Communist Party and Lombardo's influence were printed on the Mexican election ballots would hinder loan negotiations. The Mexican government then refused to print the Mexican Communist Party on the election ballot and disqualified all members of the People's Socialist Party led by Lombardo in Congress. The United States also suggested that Mexico should devalue its currency, and the Alemán government reduced the statutory exchange rate of the Mexican peso to 8.75 pesos to the dollar.

    After Mexico did all this, a minor official of the US State Department published a letter stating that the US government would not lend money to Mexico, but suggested that Mexico cancel the nationalization of oil and hand it back to foreign private monopoly enterprises for exploitation. After this letter was published, Mexico had no choice but to abandon all negotiations regarding the loan.

    In Cuba, negotiations on US loans and investments are also underway today. According to news about the loan, this loan is in accordance with the American line, which is deeply hated by Latin American countries. In order to obtain this new loan (which will add new burdens to the people), the Cuban government has promised to abolish the laws that protect Cuban technicians and workers with priority employment rights, reduce salaries, abolish the regulations that require consideration of seniority when promoting or dismissing workers, and abolish the regulations that require sufficient reasons and government approval for dismissing workers. These are the conditions demanded by the United States before considering the loan request.

    Instead of supporting the development of Cuban shipping, the United States is forcing Cuba to sign a navigation and residence treaty that monopolizes Cuba's coast to American coastal vessels and turns the entire Cuba into an American colony.

    American interests in Cuba lie in increasing the mechanization of sugar production, reducing sugar prices to benefit American companies, and promoting the planting of quinine instead of jute. If Truman's Point Four Plan is implemented in Cuba, these will be its only goals, and its only result will be to make Cuba more dependent on the American market and strengthen the semi-colonial nature of the Cuban economy.

    Truman's Point Four Plan has the same goals and will have the same results for other countries in Latin America.

    Our responsibility is to expose the nature of the "bold" plan to develop backward areas. Our responsibility is to fight against all attempts by imperialism to further colonize our economies. Our responsibility is to work harder to unite the strength of the entire nation to jointly defeat the policies and oppression of imperialism, to save our industries from being destroyed by American competition, and to promote the cause of national liberation.

    Each attack by imperialists on the economies of Latin American countries provokes greater and more widespread resistance.

    The imperialists' actions against the Gran Colombia Merchant Marine Company have sparked demonstrations in Colombia.

    The conspiracy to hand over Brazilian oil to American trusts has sparked the Brazilian people's resistance struggle, with the participation of increasingly broader strata, and this struggle is being carried out under the banner of the heroic Communist Party led by Prestes.

    In Guatemala, the banana workers' struggle against the American United Fruit Company and the United Fruit Company's contempt for government laws and decisions have aroused the indignation of the entire nation.

    In Mexico, the conditions put forward by the United States to the Alemán government's request for a loan have aroused widespread and lasting protests throughout the country.

    In Cuba, the attempt to infringe upon the rights of Cuban technicians for the benefit of American enterprises has aroused strong opposition from students and business professors. Regarding the loan, after our Socialist People's Party met with Dr. Grau to discuss this matter, the struggle against this loan has greatly expanded. In all these struggles, the intense anti-foreign sentiments of the masses are manifested: hatred of foreign oppression and a desire for national liberation.

    If we know how to combine these various struggles, if we know how to explain the true meaning of current events and imperialist actions to the people, we will be able to defeat the imperialists' oppression plans, truly help the development of our backward countries, and open the road to complete national liberation.

　　论杜鲁门开发落后地区计划
    洛卡著  福英译
    洛卡同志是古巴人民社会党的总书记。此文暴露美帝对拉丁美洲诸国的经济侵略，揭穿杜鲁门的第四点计划的本质。原文由西班牙文译成英文，登载于去年十一月出版的美国共产党机关刊物《政治月刊》上。
    杜鲁门在一九四九年正月二十日向美国国会宣读其谘文，在无耻的高声诬蔑共产主义与苏联当中，提出其自吹为帮助世界落后地区开发的“大胆”计划。
    这一计划，是美国总统向国会提议的美国“向共产主义作战”的政策的要点的第四点。因此，值得把其他的三点也讲一讲。
    第一，攻击联合国安全理事会的决议需要五强一致的原则；主张采取步骤以接受那些听从美国指挥的新国家为联合国会员，以扩大美国对于联合国大会之控制；最后，把联合国变成美国进行政治侵略和夺取世界霸权之工具。
    第二，继续马歇尔计划；努力消除国际通商的“障碍”，这即是说，消除对美国控制世界贸易的障碍。
    第三，批准北大西洋公约，并给予参加北大西洋公约的国家信用贷款，使它们武装起来。
    第四点开发落后地区之“大胆”计划，必须与上述三点密切连系起来看。它们是同一帝国主义的政治的诸部分。这一帝国主义的政治，是要夺得世界霸权，并准备为建立其世界霸权的战争。
    杜鲁门在他的谘文中，以及各地帝国主义走卒们在其宣传中，都把这个问题讲得好像美国——在独占大资本家统治之下的美国——提议由它负责开发落后国家（这些国家之所以落后正是归因于帝国主义的政治）以提高其人民的生活标准。
    为要说得使人信以为真，杜鲁门把“落后国家”的经济情况描写得颇为切合事实。他说，“世界的人民有一半以上是生活穷困。食不果腹。受疾病所侵害。他们的经济生活是原始的和老死一方的。他们的贫困不仅威胁及他们自己，也威胁及比较繁荣的地区。”他于是定下了这一计划的表面上的目标，而小心翼翼地把真正的目的——剥削与帝国主义的独占化——掩蔽起来。这一计划的表面上的目标，据他所说，是：
    “……我们必须着手于一个新的大胆的计划，使我们的科学的进步与工业的进步，能用来改进和发展落后的地区。”
    这些话，已由美国独占资本家及统治者——联合水果公司、美孚石油公司、大通银行、股票证券公司等等对南美诸国的野蛮压迫和无厌剥削这些每天的实际行为所证明其为谎言了。虽然如此，拉丁美洲诸国的本国统治阶级的主要机关报，都把杜鲁门的话视为真心诚意的，并以杜鲁门的话来证明美国的慷慨与美国统治者的利他主义。
    如果实际行为证明所讲的话是些谎言，那么，这些话便不值一文钱。
    杜鲁门三番四次所说的他的从事开发落后地区的计划之目的，每天都由我们在拉丁美洲诸国所经验到的现实、由美国政府对拉丁美洲所采取的行动，证明是谎言了。
    美国帝国主义者以及其政府所企图实行的，与所说的要“帮助”落后国家发展其经济、设立工业、并提高其生活标准，是公然相矛盾的。
    美国帝国主义者及杜鲁门政府曾经干涉拉丁美洲诸国的内政，以维持盛行于拉丁美洲诸国的半殖民地的经济制度，以挫折一切要发展独立的经济之企图，以加强外国资本对拉丁美洲诸国的市场及原料来源之独占。
    美国曾经利用各种压力以阻止拉丁美洲各国相互之间的贸易、它们与欧洲诸国之间的贸易、尤其是它们与苏联及人民民主国家之间的贸易。美国的一切努力之目的，是要使拉丁美洲诸国的国际贸易都经过美国托拉斯和独占机关或受其控制；在这一点上他们已有很大的成就。例如，说古巴吧，当古巴要向阿根庭购买牛肉时，美国大使馆威吓说要禁止古巴产品输往美国，因为阿根庭牲口患蹄与嘴的病，古巴既买阿根庭的牛肉，古巴产品输入美国，就有在美国散布此病之危险。古巴乃不能向阿根庭购牛肉。可是，几个月之后，美国陆军却宣布购买阿根庭的牛肉。
    拉丁美洲诸国努力要建立和发展其自己的海运和空运的系统，美国却曾经使用而且正在使用其力所能及的一切方法来破坏。举一个实例来说。委内瑞拉、厄瓜多尔、和哥伦比亚所合力创办的大哥伦比亚商船公司，就遭受美国航运大独占公司及美国政府机关所猛烈攻击。
    拉丁美洲一些国度中刚创办的各种次要的工业，被美国不断打击。拉丁美洲诸国为要使其生产多样化而设立的许多企业，都被美国所毁灭。例如古巴，第二次世界大战尚未结束美国政府就进行拆毁尼加洛镍公司的工厂，使二千工人失业。对于制造干菜的工厂，也是如此。
    美国曾经利用所谓国际通商条约，强迫拉丁美洲诸国降低对美国产品所征的关税；可是，拉丁美洲诸国的产品却受美国配额及其他的限制。
    拉丁美洲诸国中，有少数的轻工业在战争时期有相当发展的，美国独占企业用倾销方法将其毁灭。包装物品、玻璃、纺织、皮革、鞋子等工业就是如此。在古巴，大多数的纺织厂，因受美国工业以及日本（美国占领的）制造的纺织物之竞争，被迫关闭。
    美国从没有给予拉丁美洲国家任何金融援助以发展其本国的企业。恰恰相反，美国政府曾利用某些国家的金融上的需要，勒索得一些对它们的经济极有害的让步，并侵害它们的国家主权。例如，墨西哥要向美国借款以改进其国有化了的石油工业。为要获得此一借款，墨西哥答应租借一丰富的油田给鲍莱（杜鲁门的密友），使他会从中促成此事。美国政府官员暗示说，墨西哥选举票上印有墨西哥共产党以及龙巴都的影响，将有碍借款之谈判。墨西哥政府于是拒绝在选举票印上墨西哥共产党，并取消国会中龙巴都所领导的人民社会党的全体议员的资格。美国又建议墨西哥应将其货币贬值，阿尔曼政府乃把墨币法定汇兑率降低为八·七五比索兑换一美元。
    墨西哥做了这一切之后，美国国务院的一个小官员发表了一封信，说，美国政府不借款给墨西哥，而建议墨西哥取消石油之国有化，把石油再交给外国的私人独占企业去剥削，此信发表后，墨西哥只得放弃一切关于借款的谈判。
    在古巴，今天也在谈判美国借款和投资。根据关于借款的消息，这一借款是依照美国一贯的路线，为拉丁美洲诸国所深恶的。为要得到此新借款（此新借款将加重人民的新负担），古巴政府答应取消以优先雇用权来保护古巴技术人员与工人之法律，减低薪水，取消提拔工人或解雇工人时须照顾服务年期之规定，取消开除工人要有充分理由并须由政府批准之规定。这一些，是美国所要挟的在考虑借款请求以前的条件。
    美国并不是赞助古巴航运的发展，而是强迫古巴签订这样的一个航海居住条约，该条约把古巴的沿海变成美国驶行沿海的轮船所独占的地区，并把古巴全国变成美国的属地。
    美国在古巴的利益，是在于提高糖的生产的机械化、减低糖的价格使美国的大公司得利，并促进种植奎宁以代替黄麻。如果杜鲁门的第四点计划实施于古巴，这一些就是其唯一的目标，而其唯一的结果就是使古巴更加依靠美国市场，并加强古巴经济的半殖民地性。
    杜鲁门的第四点计划，对于拉丁美洲的其他国家，其目标也是如此，其结果也将是如此。
    我们的责任是把开发落后地区的“大胆”计划的性质揭露出来。我们的责任是向帝国主义要使我们的经济更殖民地化的一切企图作战。我们的责任是更加努力团结全民族的力量共同来击败帝国主义的政治和压迫，来挽救我们的工业使其不被美国的竞争所毁灭，来促进民族解放事业。
    帝国主义者对于拉丁美洲诸国的经济之攻击，每次都引起更大的和更广泛的反抗。
    帝国主义者对大哥伦比亚商船公司的行为，引起了在哥伦比亚的示威。
    要将巴西石油交给美国托拉斯之阴谋，引起了巴西人民之反抗斗争，参加斗争的阶层日益扩大，而这斗争是在勃勒斯特所领导的英勇的共产党的旗帜之下进行的。
    在危地马拉，香蕉工人之反对美国联合水果公司的斗争以及联合水果公司之蔑视政府的法律和决定，引起了全国人民的愤慨。
    在墨西哥，美国对阿尔曼政府请求借款所提出的条件，引起了全国广泛的和持久的抗议。
    在古巴，为美国企业利益而侵害古巴技术人员的权利之企图，引起了学生们和商科教授们之猛烈反对。关于借款，在我们的社会主义人民党与格劳博士会谈此事之后，反对此一借款之斗争就非常扩大。在这一切的斗争中，都表现出民众的反对情绪之猛烈：仇恨外国的压迫，热望获得民族解放。
    如果我们知道如何把这些各种各样的斗争结合起来，如果我们知道把目前事件与帝国主义行动的真正意义向民众讲明白，我们就能够击败帝国主义者的压迫的计划，真正地帮助我们的落后国家的发展，并打开民族完全解放之道路。
