　　Improving Awareness and Discipline
　　-- A Review of the Major Inspection of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway

    The preliminary work inspection report of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway published in our newspaper today shows that serious and adverse conditions existed on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, causing huge and undue damage to our national transportation industry. This lesson should be a serious warning to the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway and all other state-owned and public enterprises.

    There are two basic reasons for the formation of this adverse phenomenon: First, the political awareness of a small number of employees of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway is not high enough. They do not understand the status of the working class in New China and the relationship between the working class and the people's state-owned enterprises. Therefore, they have adopted wrong behaviors such as embezzlement, theft, smuggling, and irresponsibility towards their state-owned enterprises. Second, the leadership at all levels of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway has not done enough to carry out political education for the employees of the railway, especially in understanding the situation below and promptly handling some mistakes and criminal behaviors. As a result, the concept of discipline has not been universally established among the employees, and a small number of backward employees dare to disregard discipline, which has aggravated the losses to the national transportation industry.

    Through this inspection, we must carry out universal and in-depth class education among all employees of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, so that every employee knows their status and relationship with the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. The employees of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway made significant contributions in the struggle against Kuomintang rule and the restoration of transportation after liberation. This is the glory of all employees of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. However, a small number of employees have been poisoned by the corrupt ideas and work styles of the Kuomintang reactionary rule era, and mistakenly treat the railway after liberation with the same attitude as they treated the railway under Kuomintang rule. Now our railway is no longer a tool for the reactionaries to exploit and oppress the people, but a tool to faithfully serve the people. If there is no Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, how can the grain from Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, the coal from Datong, the rich ore from the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, and the fur from Inner Mongolia be transported east to serve the cities of Beijing and Tianjin? If there is no Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, how can the industrial products needed by the Chahar and Suiyuan areas be transported west for the consumption of the people of Chahar and Suiyuan? Our working class occupies a leading position in the people's democratic country, and the working class is completely in the position of master in all state-owned enterprises. Can we take irresponsible and destructive actions such as theft against our own cause? Taking irresponsible and destructive actions such as theft against the people's own cause is not only a shame, but also a criminal behavior that must be punished. All employees of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway should resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against this wrong thinking.

    In order to correct this adverse phenomenon in a timely manner, the leading organs at all levels of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway should, in addition to strengthening education for employees, establish a style of going deep into the grassroots, conducting serious inspections, and strictly enforcing discipline. Only in this way can various losses be reduced or completely avoided, and the self-awareness of a small number of backward employees can be accelerated. In fact, some of the serious phenomena on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway have occurred recently, and some have existed for a long time. Before this major inspection, the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau already knew about some of the situations, but did not recognize their seriousness, and therefore did not take strict corrective measures. Due to the lax inspection by the superior leading organs, the reports from various stations and sections either downplayed these serious situations or did not mention them at all, thus putting the leading organs in a state of blindness and paralysis. This phenomenon of not understanding the situation below and letting things drift must be resolutely corrected. This major inspection should be the starting point for the transformation of the leadership style of the entire Beijing-Suiyuan Railway.

    We hope that the major inspection of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway can have satisfactory results, and can therefore promote the work of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway a step further. At the same time, we also hope that the leading organs of other railways will pay attention to inspecting their own work, and prevent all adverse phenomena from growing in secret.

### 提高觉悟性与纪律性——评京绥铁路大检查

　　提高觉悟性与纪律性
    ——评京绥铁路大检查
    本报今日发表的京绥铁路初步工作检查报告，表示京绥铁路曾经存在着严重的恶劣情况，使我们的国家运输事业受了巨大的不应有的损害。这个教训应为京绥铁路及其他所有国营公营企业所严重警惕。
    形成这种恶劣现象的基本原因有二：第一，京绥铁路中有少数员工的政治觉悟性还不高，还不了解工人阶级在新中国的地位以及工人阶级与人民国家国营企业的关系，因而对自己的国营企业采取贪污、偷盗、走私、不负责任等错误行为。第二，京绥铁路的各级领导机关对于该路员工的政治教育工作，还作得不够深入与普遍，特别是还未能深入了解下面情况，及时处理一些错误与犯罪行为，因而未能在员工中普遍建立起纪律观念，使少数落后员工敢于目无纪律，加重了国家运输事业的损失。
    通过这一次的检查，我们必须在京绥路全体员工中进行普遍与深入的阶级教育，使每一个员工都知道自己的地位，以及与京绥路的关系。京绥路员工在反对国民党统治与解放后恢复交通的斗争中，曾经有过重大贡献，这是京绥路全体员工的光荣。但现在少数员工却受了国民党反动统治时代腐败思想作风的遗毒，错误地用过去对待国民党统治下的铁路的态度，来对待解放以后的铁路。现在我们的铁路已不再是反动派用来剥削与压迫人民的工具，而是忠实地为人民服务的工具了。察绥两省的粮食、大同的煤矿、宣化龙烟铁矿的富砂、以及内蒙一带的皮毛，如果没有京绥路，怎样能东运为京津各城市服务呢？察绥一带所需要的工业品，如果没有京绥路，又怎能西运供察绥人民的消费呢？我们工人阶级在人民民主国家中居于领导地位，一切国营企业中，工人阶级完全处于主人翁的地位，我们能够对于自己的事业采取不负责任与偷盗等破坏行动吗？对于人民自己的事业，采取不负责任与偷盗等破坏行为，不但是耻辱，而且是必须惩处的犯罪行为。京绥路全体员工应当坚决与这种错误思想作不调和的斗争。
    为了及时纠正这种恶劣现象，京绥路各级领导机关除应对员工加强教育之外，应当建立深入下层、认真检查与厉行纪律的作风。这样才能减少以至完全避免各种损失，并因而加速少数落后员工之自觉。事实上，京绥路这种严重现象，有些是新近发生，有些是早已存在。张家口铁路分局在此次大检查前，已经知道了一些情况，而未认识到它的严重性，因而未采取严格的纠正办法。由于上级领导机关检查不严，各站与各段的报告中，对于这些严重情况，或则轻描淡写，或则根本不谈，于是使领导机关陷于盲目麻痹的状态。这种不了解下情，放任自流的现象，必须坚决纠正。这次大检查就应当是京绥路全线转变领导作风的起点。
    我们盼望京绥路大检查能够有完满的结果，能因此把京绥路的工作向前推动一步。我们同时也盼望其他铁路的领导机关注意检查自己的工作，要防止一切恶劣现象在暗中滋长。
