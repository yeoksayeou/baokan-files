Serious Embezzlement and Malpractice Occurs in the Huailai County Cooperative of Chahar Province
National Loss of 16,000 Jin of Millet
Principal Culprit Zhang Guisheng Has Been Sent to the Government for Legal Punishment

[Charnan News] According to a report in the Chahar Daily on March 14th: Zhang Guisheng, the former business section chief of the Huailai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, has been involved in embezzlement and malpractice, causing a loss of 16,720 jin of millet in national wealth over the past six months. The details are as follows:

Last November, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative acted as an agent for the Grain Company to purchase grain. He only issued IOUs for 4,000 jin of rice (through the accountant) and then withdrew 1.8 million yuan to send his brother to Beijing for business. In September, he privately lent a cadre from the Dagu District one shi and one dou of rice money, without recording it in the books or issuing any receipts. In July, when the Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought trees in his village, he privately took a large cart of timber home. He used two of the public carts to send crabapples to Beijing for his brother, with round-trip expenses equivalent to one shi and four dou of rice.

Private Collusion and Self-Serving Practices

Last June, he used the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's stamp to send a letter to the Chicheng County Cooperative, recommending his friend (a private merchant) to buy soybeans, recording it in the Huailai Supply and Marketing Cooperative's current account. In July, he borrowed another 200,000 yuan (at a rice price of 105 yuan per jin) from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's cash to a private merchant. In August, when buying fruit, the market price was seven dou of rice per load, but he bought it in his own village at a price of one shi of rice per load, buying more than 70 loads in total, overspending 21 shi and eight dou of rice. In the same month, he gave his friend two bags of millet flour, without paying for it or recording it in the books. He used the cooperative's assets to advance three shi of rice to the private merchant Yang Shichang for business. In April, he also gave his friend 240 jin of naked oats on credit. During the epidemic prevention period, when cloth prices rose, he drafted the next day's price in the business section and then asked Secretary Huang from the bank to buy half a bolt of gray foreign cloth at the current day's price at the store (Note: Secretary Huang should also conduct a thorough self-criticism).

Disregard for Organization, Terrible Work Style

Zhang Guisheng was originally a landlord. He joined the revolutionary work in 1947 and although he served as a district security officer and an industrial and commercial officer, his landlord class ideology has not changed in the slightest. He has no concept of serving the people at all. Therefore, after he became the chief of the business section of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative last April, he started a small faction, opposed the leadership, and showed off everywhere. For example, when Yang Dexiang of the cooperative was criticized and removed for poor conduct, he opposed it. When the leadership criticized him, he quibbled. He has no regard for the organization, looks down on the leadership, and engages in embezzlement and malpractice at will, to the point of becoming irredeemable.

The Cooperative Leadership Turns a Blind Eye, Giving Zhang Guisheng Opportunities for Corruption

In addition, the bureaucraticism and lack of responsibility of the cooperative's leadership provided him with great convenience. For example, the director of the cooperative, Qiao Peiyu, and the deputy director, Zhang Hongru, were disunited and shirked responsibility in their work. Last autumn, Qiao went to Tianjin to sell fruit; while Zhang went to the countryside to organize agricultural loans, not returning to the cooperative for more than a month. The cooperative affairs meetings were not held for more than half a year. The lives and work of the staff within the cooperative were mixed together, and loans were made at the original price, so not only was their life very good, but there was also a lot left over. In winter, each person spent two shi of millet to make twill cotton clothes. The leadership turned a blind eye to Zhang Guisheng's various behaviors, neither investigating nor reporting, allowing it to develop. Jiang Zhongtang, the chief of the accounting section, did not stop Zhang Guisheng from embezzling public funds and selling materials on credit before the fact, and did not report it afterwards. Therefore, the Charnan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative decided that, in addition to ordering Zhang Guisheng to return all embezzled and misappropriated materials within a time limit and sending him to the government for legal action, the director and deputy director of the cooperative would each be given a major demerit; the chief of the accounting section will be given a criticism as punishment.

　　察省怀来县社发生严重贪污舞弊
    国家损失小米万六千斤
    主犯张桂生已送政府依法惩办
    【察南讯】据三月十四日察哈尔日报消息：怀来县供销社前业务股长张桂生，贪污舞弊，半年多来使国家财富遭受损失达一万六千七百二十斤小米。其经过事实如下：
    去年十一月供销社给粮食公司代购粮食，他只打了四千斤米的白条（经会计手）就支款一百八十万元，给其兄去北京作买卖。九月间私自借给大古城区干部一石一斗米的钱，既没记账，又没有单据。七月间供销社在他村买树，他私自拉回家木料一大车。用公家两辆大车给他哥往北京送海棠果一次，来往脚费合米一石四斗。
    私人拉拢假公济私
    去年六月用供销社戳记，给赤城县社去信介绍他朋友（私商）买大豆，记怀来供销社往来账。七月间从供销社现款中又借给私商二十万元（米价一百零五元一斤）。八月买水果时，市价是七斗米一驮，他到他自己村每驮果按一石米去买，共买七十余驮，多花米二十一石八斗。同月给他朋友机粉两袋，既未给钱，也没出账。他从社内资财中，给私商杨士昌垫米三石让其作买卖。四月又赊给他朋友莜面二百四十斤。防疫期间布价上涨时，他在业务股拟好了次日价格后，再找银行黄秘书到门市部按本日价格买去灰洋布半匹（按：该黄秘书亦应深作检讨）。
    目无组织作风恶劣
    按张桂生出身是个地主，于一九四七年参加革命工作，虽曾任过区治安员、工商科员等职，但其地主阶级思想意识，则毫未改变，丝毫没有为人民服务思想，因此他去年四月到供销社任业务股长后，就闹小派别，反对领导，到处显示自己。如该社杨德祥作风不好被洗刷，他则反对。领导上对他提出批评，他狡辩。目无组织，看不起领导，肆意贪污舞弊。以至发展到不可挽救。
    该社领导上视若无睹予张桂生贪污以机会
    此外，该社领导上的官僚主义，缺乏责任心，给他以极大便利。如该社主任乔配瑜和副主任张鸿儒不团结，工作上互相推诿，去年秋季乔贩果子住天津；而张则下乡组织农贷，一个多月不返社。半年多不开社务会议。社内人员生活与业务混在一起，用贷均按原价，因此不但生活很好，且剩余很多，冬季每人花两石小米做斜纹布的棉衣。领导上对张桂生的种种行为视若无睹，既不追查，又不报告，任其发展。会计股长蒋中堂，对张桂生挪借公款、赊借物资，事前不制止，事后不报告。为此，察南专区供销社决定：除限期令张桂生缴清所有贪污舞弊之物资，并送政府法办外，该社正副主任亦分别各记大过一次；会计股长则予以批评之处分。
