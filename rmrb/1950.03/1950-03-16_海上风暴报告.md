　　Report on a Sea Storm
　　By Jiao Fuchun
　　Reprinted from the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" of March 9th and 11th

　　On the morning of December 5th of last year, something astonishing happened to a unit of the People's Liberation Army conducting naval exercises off the coast of a certain place.
　　In ×× Bay, which is accustomed to stirring up trouble, the wind howled and giant waves rolled. The boat carrying the platoon led by Gao Wenbin, the commander of the 9th company of a certain regiment, was swept away by a storm. There were forty-two people on board.
　　After the incident, the regiment and battalion sent ships to search everywhere, but after searching for seven or eight days, there was no news. Everyone in the military headquarters thought, "They're done for." But they all held onto a faint hope: "Maybe they will come back." The branch, the regimental committee, and the battalion committee expressed their willingness to accept punishment from higher authorities for this matter.
　　Battalion Commander Sun Guangjian often ran to the coastal highway at night, lighting piles of fires. Facing the boundless ocean, he sighed, "Maybe they are still alive. It would be best if they drifted to an island, without enemies, with civilians. But it's been more than ten days, what are they eating? I'm afraid they'll starve to death…" Lying on his bed at home, he couldn't sleep, and familiar faces revived in his mind. Forty-two lively young men, all good soldiers, Company Commander Gao, Platoon Leader Zhao, Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang, Deputy Platoon Leader Xie, Qi Xiqian… They were all heroic soldiers tested in the war. For the liberation of Taiwan, they were practicing hard on the sea day and night, their clothes almost always wet, sweat seeping out, seawater seeping in… They were finished before they even got a chance to participate in the attack on Taiwan! How painful!
　　When the 9th Company lined up, the position of the first platoon was empty. The first platoon's dormitory was empty and desolate. Comrades looked at the slogans on their wall: "Actively train soldiers, not afraid of hardship, make contributions to the liberation of Taiwan!" They deeply missed their comrades whose survival was uncertain.

　　At sea, the wind was getting stronger and stronger, and it was impossible to open one's eyes while standing on the boat. Waves more than two zhang high threw the small boat to the crests of the waves, and the unsteered boat vibrated and swayed in the wind and waves. The vast majority of the platoon fell seasick, some vomiting up all their food and water, then vomiting up excrement, and when they ran out of excrement, they vomited up bloody clumps. The cabin was filled with a stuffy, fishy stench, and even those who weren't seasick were vomiting.
　　"There's a hole in the middle cabin!" someone suddenly shouted.
　　Deputy Platoon Leader Xie rushed up, took off his shoes, and used his bare foot to plug the hole, while telling others to quickly bail water out with rice bowls. The sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member made him seem nailed there, not moving at all. The boat traveled more than twenty li thanks to the plug made by his foot.
　　In the end, Deputy Squad Leader Zhang had a good idea, taking down a pickaxe handle, wrapping it with cotton, and plugging the hole. Deputy Platoon Leader Xie breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Thanks, old brother, for liberating me."
　　The wind and waves weakened. The company commander ordered the anchor to be dropped, but the anchor rope was broken again.
　　In the struggle against the raging waves, Company Commander Gao encouraged himself: "The composure of the commander is strength, must remain calm. If there is chaos, the lives of forty-two people will be over!" So he sat on the boat calmly, puffing on a cigarette. The soldiers occasionally poked their heads out to look at the company commander, who was still smoking, and then lay down with peace of mind.
　　At dusk, the boat drifted to a lonely island.
　　Deputy Platoon Leader Xie led four people to search the island: the island was one li long from east to west, one hundred meters wide from north to south, two mountain peaks, steep cliffs on all sides, only two paths, one family, father and son, planting two mu of sweet potatoes…. The company commander ordered Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang to take the third squad to watch the boat, and eat a meal of sweet potatoes tonight, and wait for the wind to calm down tomorrow to return.
　　Just as they were about to eat, the sound of machine gun fire suddenly rang out. The machine gun squad discovered that it was fired by an enemy ship two li away to the south. Without waiting for orders from above, a burst of machine gun fire drove the ship away. Based on the situation, the company commander judged that three sides of this island were surrounded by enemies.
　　Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Lixue was ordered to take the third squad plus a machine gun to camp on the east and west mountain peaks to serve as sentries. They were given one of the four tattered quilts carried on the boat. They divided it up, found a place sheltered from the wind on two sides, and sat down side by side. Ten people stretched their legs together and covered themselves with the tattered quilt. Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang sat on the outermost side. Ten people squeezed tightly together, but the quilt couldn't solve the problem at all. Some simply stuck their legs under other people's legs to keep warm. Later, they stacked their legs like piles of firewood, and the one on top would wake up from the cold and switch legs with the one on the bottom, taking turns using their legs as a blanket.
　　The night passed peacefully. The next morning, just as they were about to leave, they suddenly discovered that the boat had been rolled up by the waves and crashed into the reefs, and was in a terrible state. This was a major tragedy. The company commander regretted his numbness and carelessness, not paying attention to the protection of the boat. What to do? There was no other way but to stay on the island temporarily. If they were to stay, there would be many problems: eating, sleeping, enemy attacks, controlling the morale of the troops…
　　But in the heart of every revolutionary soldier, there is always such a firm belief—the team led by the Communist Party has no insurmountable difficulties.
　　Based on the actual situation, the cadres estimated that there was a solution. First, if the enemy attacked again, lure them to land and annihilate them to seize their boat; second, there are civilians on the mountain, they must have civilian boats coming and going; third, the superiors will definitely look for them. However, the unanimous opinion was that these were just hopes, and they must prepare for the most difficult situation.
　　As needed by the environment, the organizational form also changed. The artillery team became the cooking team, because on this deserted island, eating became a matter of paramount importance, so the platoon leader personally took charge. The machine gun squad was divided into three groups, attached to the rifle squads, and stationed in three places. The civilians' small thatched hut served as the kitchen and the general headquarters, while each of the other squads built a grass shed for lodging.
　　The platoon leader collected all the matches from the platoon and kept them himself. That night, they began to eat thin gruel, made from one-third sweet potato shreds and two-thirds sweet potato leaves, with water. From then on, they had two meals a day.
　　Whether the soldiers were on sentry duty or picking sweet potato leaves, they were constantly looking towards the northwest. As long as they spotted a sail on the sea, it would cause a burst of ecstasy. But their calls went unanswered, and they quickly disappeared again.
　　Three days passed, and our boats, civilian boats, and enemy boats did not come. The morale of a few individuals began to fluctuate.
　　The first temporary Party branch committee meeting was held on the third day. The meeting decided to call on all Party members to carry forward the fine tradition and learn from Comrade Chen Shan's indomitable spirit.
　　"Comrade Chen Shan, with one leg, persisted in the Culai Mountains for more than a year. Can't we persist to victory with forty-two pairs of legs today? The Red Army crossed the Long March eating leather belts. Can't we endure the difficulties today by drinking thin porridge?" The twenty Communist Party members all recalled Comrade Chen Shan's difficult experiences and resolutely expressed their support for the branch's resolution, uniting the masses and persisting to victory. "It can still be eaten for another day!" said the machine gun deputy gunner, pointing to the machine gun belt. Everyone laughed. (To be continued)

　　海上风暴报告

    转载三月九日和十一日上海“解放日报”
    是去年十二月五号的上午，解放军某部在某地海边进行海航演习的部队，发生了一件惊人的事情。
    习惯兴风作浪的××湾，风呼呼的叫，巨浪翻滚着。某团九连连长高文宾带着的一排，所乘的那只船被暴风卷走了。全船共有四十二人。
    事情发生后，团、营派船到处寻找，整整找了七、八天没有一点音信。军部里的人谁都想着：“完了”。但都怀着一个渺茫的希望：“也许他们还会回来”。支部、团委、营委为了这件事，表示愿受上级的处分。
    营长孙光俭，常在夜间跑到环海公路上，燃起一堆堆的火，他面对着滔滔无际的海洋，叹息着：“也许他们还活着。顶好能飘到一个岛子上，没有敌人，有老百姓才好呢。可是十几天了，他们吃什么？怕饿也饿死了。……”他回家躺在铺上，反复也睡不着，一个个熟悉的面孔，在眼前复活起来。四十二个活蹦乱跳的小伙子，他们都是好战士，高连长、赵排长、张排副、谢排副、齐喜千……他们都是在战争中考验了的英勇战士，为了解放台湾，他们又日日夜夜苦练在海面上，衣服几乎经常是湿的，里面的汗水向外渗，外面的海水向里浸……打台湾还未捞着参加就这样的完了！多么痛心！
    九连站队时，一排的位置是空的。一排的宿舍是空荡荡的，战友们看着他们墙头的标语：“积极练兵不怕苦，解放台湾立功劳！”都深深的怀念着存亡未卜的同志们。
    ×       ×        ×    ×
    一排在海上，这天风越刮越紧，站在船上连眼也睁不开。两丈多高的浪，把小船抛到浪尖，失去掌握的船在风浪中任其震动摇幌。一排绝大部分同志晕倒了，有的饭水吐干了，吐屎水，屎水吐空了，吐血饼子，船舱内充满一片闷热的腥臭味，不晕船的也呕吐了。
    “中舱破了个洞！”有人忽然喊道。
    谢排副不顾一切的爬起来，跑过去，把鞋子一脱，用赤脚塞住了洞口，一面叫人上去，用饭盆赶紧往外掏水。共产党员的责任心使他像被钉在那里一样，一动也不动。船就靠他这个脚做的塞子，走了二十多里路。
    最后还是张班副的好主意，把一只镐头的棒搞了下来，缠上棉花，把洞口塞住了。谢排副松了口气说：“亏你老兄把我解放了。”
    风浪弱了。连长命令抛锚，锚绳又被折断了。
    在和狂暴巨浪斗争中，高连长鼓励着自己：“指挥员的沉着就是力量，千万要镇静。要是一乱动，四十二条命就完啦！”于是他不动声色的坐在船上吧嗒吧嗒的抽烟，战士们不时的伸出头看着连长，还在抽烟，便安心的躺下。
    黄昏，船飘到一个孤岛。
    谢排副带领四个人搜索的结果：全岛东西一里长，南北百米宽，两个山顶，四面陡壁，只两条通路，一户人家，父子二人，种二亩地瓜……。连长命令张排副带三班看船，今晚买一顿地瓜吃，待明日风平队回。
    他们正要吃饭，忽然响起了机枪声。机枪班发现是南面二里地以外一只敌船打的。他们没等上级命令，一阵机枪，把船打跑了，连长根据情况的判断，这个岛的三面都是敌人。
    张立学排副奉命带三班加一挺机枪到东西山头露营，担任警戒。船上带的四条破被，他们分到一条，在一个两面遮风的地方膀排膀坐下来，十个人把腿伸在一起，盖上那条破被，张排副坐在最外面。十个人紧紧挤在一起，那条被根本解决不了问题，有的就干脆把腿插到别人腿底下取暖，后来一个插一个同垛木柴一样架成了腿架子，架在最上空的冻醒了就把腿换到最底下，轮流着把腿当被盖。
    一夜平安无事的过去，第二天早晨正要走，忽然发现船被海浪卷起撞在礁石上，已破乱不堪。这是一件最大的悲哀，连长悔恨自己麻木大意，未注意船的保护。怎么办呢？除了暂住在岛上，没有第二条道路可走。要住下，问题就多了，吃饭、睡觉、敌人的攻击，部队思想的掌握………
    但在每个革命战士心中，永远有这样一个坚定的信念——共产党领导的队伍没有克服不了的困难。
    干部们根据实际情况，估计是有办法的，第一、敌人再来攻击诱其登陆歼敌夺船；第二、山上有老百姓绝不能独存孤岛，一定有民船来往；第三、上级一定要找。然而一致的意见这些仅是希望，还必须向最困难处着想。
    随着环境的需要，组织形式也改变了。炮组变炊事组，因为在这荒岛上，吃饭成了天大的事，故由排长亲自掌握。机枪班分成三组，附给步枪组，分三处驻扎。老百姓的小茅屋作伙房和总的指挥部，其他每班搭一草棚住宿。
    排长收起了全排的洋火，自己保存，当晚便开始吃稀粥，由三分之一的地瓜丝掺三分之二的地瓜叶，加水作成，以后每天两顿。
    战士们在放哨也好，在摘地瓜叶也好，时时刻刻都张望着西北方向，只要在海面发现一只帆，也便引起一阵狂喜。叫叫不应，它们都很快的又消逝了。
    三天过去了，我们的船、民船、敌人的船都没有来。个别人的情绪也有些波动起来。
    第一次临时党的支部委员会在第三天举行了，会上决定号召全体党员发扬优良传统，并学习陈善同志的百折不挠精神。
    “陈善同志一条腿，在徂徕山坚持一年多，今天我们四十二双腿坚持不到胜利吗？红军吃皮带渡过了长征，我们今天喝稀饭还不能熬过困难吗？”二十个共产党员都回忆着陈善同志艰苦的经历，都坚决表示拥护支部决议，团结群众，坚持到胜利。“它还可以吃一天呢！”机枪副射手，指着机枪的转带说。大家都笑了。（未完）
