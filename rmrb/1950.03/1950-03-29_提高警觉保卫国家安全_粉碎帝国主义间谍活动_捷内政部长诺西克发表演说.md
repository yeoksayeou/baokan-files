　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 25th: Czech Minister of Interior Nosek recently delivered a speech in the National Assembly's Defense and Security Committee, stating: Foreign imperialist blocs are sending spies, saboteurs, and terrorists to Czechoslovakia, and are attempting to obstruct our country's socialist construction and the consolidation of the people's democratic system by exploiting all reactionary remnants and all enemies of the Czech Republic to engage in activities that endanger the country.

　　Nosek cited facts to expose the conspiracies of Western imperialist ruling groups, stating: In March and May of 1949, security organs uncovered two anti-state armed rebellion conspiracies, proving that British spy Wildisch (an official at the British Consulate in Prague) and British agent and traitor Ababa were related to the first conspiracy. It was also proven that participants in the second conspiracy included British spy Major Prokesh. State security organs also uncovered the espionage activities of American spy engineer Cohen, the espionage activities of French military attaché Colonel Hélio, and the economic espionage center headed by the American counselor in Prague, Gain. In addition, other spies were uncovered, namely representatives from Denmark, Canada, and the Netherlands, and it has been proven that these people were united in their activities and established a unified intelligence agency of American and British imperialists dedicated to opposing people's democratic countries, primarily the Soviet Union. These uncovered spy centers and agents attempted to turn Czechoslovakia into a base for their criminal activities.

　　Nosek emphasized the necessity of raising vigilance, pointing out: The Czechoslovak State Security Force has made great achievements in exposing anti-state conspiracies and the espionage activities of international imperialism, and in fighting against criminal activities. He also pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the political work of the State Security Force and the political education of its personnel. It is also necessary to promote new cadres from the working class to strengthen the State Security Force.

　　提高警觉保卫国家安全  粉碎帝国主义间谍活动
    捷内政部长诺西克发表演说
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社布拉格二十五日讯：捷克斯洛伐克内政部长诺西克，顷在国民议会国防与保安委员会中发表演说称：外国的帝国主义集团派遣间谍、破坏者和恐怖分子到捷克来，并且利用一切的反动残余和捷克的一切敌人来从事危害国家的活动，从而企图阻挠我国的社会主义建设和人民民主制度的巩固。
    诺西克引用事实，暴露西方帝国主义国家统治集团的阴谋活动称：在一九四九年三月和五月，保安机关破获了两起反国家的武装暴动的阴谋，证明英国间谍维尔第施（英国驻布拉格领事馆官员）和英国特务与叛徒阿巴瓦与第一次阴谋有关，也证明了第二次阴谋的参加者包括有英国间谍普罗凯施少校。国家保安机关还破获了美国间谍工程师郭恩的间谍活动，法国军事参赞艾里奥上校的间谍活动，和以美国驻布拉格的参赞盖恩为首的经济谍报中心。此外，还破获了另外一些间谍，那就是丹麦、加拿大和荷兰的代表们，并已证明这些人联合一致进行活动，并且成立了一个统一的、专为反对人民民主国家而主要是反对苏联的美英帝国主义者的特务机关。这些被破获的间谍中心与特务，企图把捷克斯洛伐克变为他们的罪恶活动的基地。
    诺西克着重指出提高警觉的必要性，并指出：捷克斯洛伐克国家保安队在揭破反国家阴谋及国际帝国主义的间谍活动上，在和罪恶活动进行斗争上，已有很大的成绩。他又指出，必须加强国家保安队的政治工作及其人员的政治教育。从工人阶级中提拔新干部来加强国家保安队，也是必要的。
