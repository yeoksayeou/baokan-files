Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 13th: The winter repair project on the Yangtze and Huaihe River main embankments in northern Anhui has concluded. A total of 8,270,000 cubic meters of earthwork has been completed, accounting for 35.2% of the total project of 23,500,000 cubic meters. The winter repair project on the Yangtze and Huaihe River main embankments commenced in early December last year, with over 360,000 civilian laborers working on the embankments. During the embankment repair process, government cadres at all levels actively led the civilian laborers in repairing the embankments. For example, when Suxong County was repairing an 8,800-meter long project, Lin Ran, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Suxong County Committee, and cadres and Communist Party members at all levels, braved the severe cold and took the lead in entering the water, greatly moving the civilian laborers. As a result, they overcame all difficulties and completed the task of throwing 400,000 cubic meters of sand in just over ten days, firmly establishing the foundation of the embankment and ensuring the smooth progress of the embankment repair work. In order to solve the difficulty of a lack of engineering personnel, administrative cadres in various counties generally received engineering training. The Secretary of the CPC Tongcheng County Committee and cadres in various districts and villages learned basic engineering knowledge such as how to transport soil, tamp the earth, extract soil, and make slopes. As a result, the engineering work in the county generally met standards and was praised by the Anqing Special District Embankment Repair Headquarters. This winter repair project was closely integrated with disaster relief work, implementing work-for-relief to mobilize and organize disaster victims to work on the embankments; disaster-stricken people accounted for 80% to 90% of the 360,000 civilian laborers. Each civilian laborer could receive three and a half to four catties of grain for carrying one cubic meter of soil. In addition to solving the livelihood problems of most of the disaster victims, a large amount of work grain was saved and invested in sideline production. For example, 22,000 civilian laborers in Funan County saved more than one million catties of work grain and opened oil mills and flour mills to carry out sideline production. According to incomplete statistics from Anqing Special District, the winter repair solved the livelihood difficulties of 300,000 disaster victims in the district. During the winter repair, labor emulation campaigns were also widely launched, combined with political and cultural education work. More than 5,000 embankment repair heroes emerged in two districts of Tongcheng County, effectively ensuring the completion of the winter repair project. During the embankment repair, the peasant associations and Communist Youth League organizations also made great progress. According to statistics from Huaining County, among the civilian laborers participating in the embankment repair, more than 4,900 new peasant association members and more than 100 Communist Youth League members were developed, and more than 3,000 activists were discovered and cultivated, laying a solid foundation for future rural work. The main shortcomings in this winter repair were: some areas one-sidedly emphasized disaster relief and neglected engineering, resulting in waste of public grain and unstable engineering. In addition, in some areas, administrative cadres and technical cadres did not cooperate closely enough, resulting in the project not meeting standards. The special districts are now summarizing the experience of the winter repair project in order to prepare for a larger spring repair project.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 13th: More than 34,000 farmers in Hunan Province are actively carrying out the Datong Lake flood storage and reclamation project. Datong Lake is located in the central part of Dongting Lake. The south, west, and north sides of the lake are land, and the east mouth is connected to Dongting Lake. There are 103 embankments belonging to Yuanjiang, Nanxian, and Xiangyin counties around the lake. Due to the high siltation of the east mouth, the lake water cannot be discharged, causing the Yangtze River flood to pour into the lake last year, submerging 300,000 mu of land along the lake. Therefore, the Datong Lake flood storage and reclamation project is actually related to the safety of the lives and property of the people on both banks of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, especially the 400,000 people living near the lake in Yuanjiang, Nanxian, and Xiangyin counties. Before liberation, the people in the lake area had organized themselves several times to build transverse embankments at the east mouth, but they were unsuccessful due to the sabotage of the Kuomintang reactionary government and local bullies. After liberation, the Hunan Provincial Provisional Government formulated a plan for building embankments and digging canals in Datong Lake, deciding to build transverse embankments at the east mouth to close the lake mouth, making it a huge reservoir that can store the floodwaters inverted from the Yangtze River to eliminate flood disasters in various places in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In normal times, the stored water will be used to irrigate farmland. At the same time, the plan also stipulates that two channels should be dug in the east and west of the lake to drain water into Dongting Lake using natural slopes, in order to save the submerged embankment fields and increase the area of reclamation on the high beaches in the lake. After this plan was approved by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau established the Datong Lake Flood Storage and Reclamation Project Office, mobilizing more than 34,000 civilian laborers in Nanxian, Xiangyin, and Yuanjiang counties to start embankment repair and canal digging work in mid-January. During the project, the main responsible cadres of the three counties personally led this work, and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army also came from Changsha to participate in the river digging. The civilian laborers launched labor emulation campaigns with each other, greatly improving work efficiency. By early February, 40% of the transverse embankment project had been completed, and the drainage project had also begun. The entire project is expected to be completed before the end of this month.

　　皖北长江淮河冬修工程完成八百万公方
    湖南三万农民修筑大通湖
    【新华社合肥十三日电】皖北境内长江、淮河两大干堤的冬修工程已经结束。共计完成土方八百二十七万公方，占全部工程二千三百五十万公方的百分之三十五点二。长江、淮河两大干堤的冬修工程系于去年十二月上旬动工，上堤民工达三十六万余人。在修堤过程中，各级人民政府工作干部均积极领导民工修堤。如宿松县修筑长达八千八百公尺的工程时，中共宿松县委副书记林燃和各级干部及共产党员不顾严寒，带头下水，给民工们极大感动，因而克服了一切困难，十余天即完成四十万公方的抛沙任务，扎好了堤基，使修堤工作顺利进行。为了解决工程人员缺乏的困难，各县行政干部普遍受了工程训练，桐城县中共县委书记和各区乡村干部都学会了如何上土、打硪、取土、作坡等基本工程知识，因而该县工程一般都做到合乎标准，曾得到安庆专区修堤指挥部的表扬。此次冬修工程并与救灾工作密切结合进行，实行以工代赈，动员和组织灾民上堤；三十六万民工中受灾群众即占百分之八十到九十。每个民工挑一方土可得三斤半到四斤粮食，除解决了大部灾民的生活问题外，并节余大批工粮，投入副业生产。如阜南县二万二千民工即节余工粮百余万斤，开办油坊、粉坊，进行副业生产。另据安庆专区不完全的统计，该区因冬修而解决了三十万灾民的生活困难。各地在冬修中又普遍开展立功运动，并结合进行了政治、文化教育工作，桐城县两个区涌现出修堤功臣五千余人，有力地保证了冬修工程的完成。在修堤中，农会、青年团组织也有很大发展。据怀宁县统计在修堤民工中共发展农会会员四千九百余人、青年团员一百余人，发现与培养积极分子三千余人，为今后农村工作打下了有力的基础。此次冬修中主要偏向为：个别地区片面强调救灾，而忽视工程，发生浪费公粮与工程不巩固的现象。另外有些地区行政干部与技术干部互相配合不够密切，致使工程达不到标准。现各专区正总结冬修工程经验，以便迎接更大的春修工程。
    【新华社长沙十三日电】湖南省三万四千余农民正积极进行大通湖蓄洪垦殖工程。大通湖位于洞庭湖中部，该湖的南、西、北三面都是陆地，东口与洞庭湖相通，环湖有沅江、南县、湘阴三县的一百另三个垸子，因东口淤高，湖水无法排泄，致使去年长江洪水注入湖中，淹没了沿湖三十万亩土地。因此，大通湖的蓄洪垦殖工程，实关系着长江中、下游两岸人民，特别是沅江、南县、湘阴三县滨湖的四十万人民的生命财产的安全。解放前滨湖地区人民曾经先后数次自动组织起来，修筑东口横堤，但在国民党反动政府和恶霸地主的破坏下，都未成功。解放以后，湖南省临时政府即制定了大通湖筑堤开渠计划，决定在东口修筑横堤，将湖口封闭，成为一个巨大的蓄水库，可将长江倒灌的洪水放入湖内，以消灭长江中、下流各地的洪水灾害；平时则将蓄水灌溉农田。同时，计划中并规定在该湖东西挖掘两条渠道，利用自然坡度向洞庭湖排水，以救出被淹垸田和增加湖内高滩垦殖面积。这个计划经中央人民政府水利部批准后，省府水利局即成立了大通湖蓄洪垦殖工程处，在南县、湘阴、沅江三县动员了三万四千多名民工，于一月中旬开始修堤挖渠工作。在工程进行时，三县的主要负责干部都亲自领导这一工作，解放军某部也从长沙赶来参加挖河。民工们相互展开了劳动竞赛，工作效率大为提高。到二月初，横堤工程已完成百分之四十，排水工程也已开始，全部工程预计可于本月底以前完成。
