    Overcoming Learning Difficulties of Miners
    Xi'an Coal Mine Establishes Pithead Schools
    Promoting Production Directly Through Widespread Worker Participation in Part-Time Study
    [Report from this newspaper] The Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine has adopted the method of establishing pithead spare-time schools to overcome the difficulties in spare-time learning for miners caused by inconsistent working hours and dispersed work areas. This has gradually put worker spare-time learning on a regular footing, absorbing 51 percent (4,782 people) of the mine's workers to participate in learning, and directly promoting production.

    Since March of last year, worker spare-time education has gradually been launched at the mine. However, in the first six months, the attendance rate and learning enthusiasm of the night school students showed fluctuating trends. By August and September, many night schools were on the verge of shutting down. The main reason for this was that the miners' work was in three rotating shifts, while the night school stipulated that the first and third shifts study from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, and the second shift studied at noon. The first-shift workers needed to go home to eat and rest after a day of labor, and the third-shift workers had to go to work after studying and sleeping for less than three hours, so fewer and fewer people attended school. Moreover, workers changed shifts every seven days, disrupting their learning and hindering regular study. In addition, learning was unorganized and unplanned, with night schools and various training classes running concurrently, making the union's leadership of learning scattered and powerless, and teachers were few and overworked. In the movements of evaluating merits, checking waste, etc., cultural and educational work was not integrated with various production movements, and some mines occupied the night school's learning time, which also affected the workers' learning.

    In order to solve these problems, the mine first conducted research in the second and third pits of the Dacheng Mine, absorbed the workers' opinions, and decided to change the past fixed-time centralized learning into pithead spare-time schools. The learning time was changed to follow the shift, with each shift studying for one hour before starting work, and then collectively entering the pit to work. In order to unify the leadership of learning, each mine established a pithead learning committee to overcome the phenomenon of disorganization and lack of planning. The learning committee was responsible for organizing, planning, and inspecting learning, and each member had a clear division of labor and specific responsibilities. Students were organized into detachments according to residential areas, and each detachment had a detachment leader. In the past, night school teachers were part-time elementary school teachers; now, cadres and workers in the class were elected as teachers. Each of the three shifts in each pithead school selected one cultural, political, and technical teacher. Because the teachers are cadres, staff, or workers who work in the same shift, they can follow the shift and the course.

    After the establishment of pithead schools, the number of workers participating in learning gradually increased. By December of last year, the entire mine had established 11 pithead schools and 5 night schools, totaling 62 classes, with 4,782 students. This broke the past shortcomings of being unable to organize a large number of workers for learning on a small scale, and also solved the difficulty of insufficient teachers. In the past few months, not only has great progress been made in improving workers' cultural, political, and technical levels, but it has also directly promoted production. For example, the experience of Yue Decai's team in the second pit of the Dacheng Mine in creating a new record for track laying was disseminated in the pithead school, increasing the efficiency of each shift in the entire pit from one meter to more than three meters. After discussing safety regulations in each mine, the vigilance of employees was strengthened and accidents were reduced. After discussing labor discipline, the unorganized phenomenon of workers not observing discipline was overcome. Since the organization of pithead schools, workers have been eating on time, lining up to go to work, and reducing lateness and absenteeism. In addition, because most of the pithead workers participated in learning, any notices or instructions from the mine can be explained in a few minutes before and after class, avoiding the need to find cadres and then workers layer by layer to hold meetings, wasting manpower and time, as in the past.

    The current problems in the mine's worker education are, first of all, that teachers must be improved. The teachers selected from cadres, workers, and staff in each pithead school have fewer difficulties in teaching technical courses and elementary-level cultural courses, but have many difficulties in teaching intermediate-level and advanced-level cultural courses. Therefore, the mine is now focusing on running elementary-level classes, with intermediate-level classes as secondary, and advanced-level classes have not yet been established in some places. In improving the teaching staff, it is also not easy for teachers to meet together for meetings and research due to shift work. To solve this problem, there will be two methods in the future: (1) Strengthen the pithead learning committee's research on teaching methods and content to improve the teaching staff. (2) Hire a full-time teacher for each school.

    Secondly, there were not many spare rooms in each pit, and it was difficult to find classrooms after splitting into classes. Now some pits temporarily separate larger rooms with screens for classes, and some temporarily build wooden houses. In the future, it will be necessary to build a batch of strong and durable pithead worker school classrooms in the pits. In addition, most of the workers participating in learning at the mine do not yet have textbooks. This is also a problem that urgently needs to be resolved uniformly.

　　克服矿山工人学习困难
    西安煤矿设坑口学校
    大多数工人参加业余学习，直接推动了生产
    【本报讯】东北西安煤矿采取建立坑口业余学校的办法，克服了矿山工人业余学习中因工作时间不一致与工作地区分散而影响学习的困难，使工人业余学习逐渐走上正规化，吸收了全矿工人的百分之五十一（四千七百八十二人）参加学习，并直接推动了生产。
    该矿自去年三月以来，工人业余教育逐渐开展。但在开始的半年中，各夜校学员出席率及学习情绪呈现忽高忽低的现象，到八、九月时，很多夜校陷于停顿。其主要原因是因为煤矿工人的作业是三班轮流，而夜校规定一、三两班在晚上六点至八点学习，二班在中午学习。头班工友劳动了一天需要回家吃饭休息，三班工友参加学习后，回家睡不到三小时就要上班，所以上学的人愈来愈少。而且，工人每七天倒班一次，倒班后学习就乱了，妨碍正规学习的进行。此外，学习无组织无计划，夜校和各种训练班同时并办，使工会对学习领导分散无力，教员少忙不过来；在评功、检查浪费等运动中，文教工作未和各种生产运动结合起来，有些矿占用了夜校的学习时间，这也影响了工人的学习。
    为解决这些问题，该矿首先在大成矿二、三两坑进行研究，吸收了工人的意见，决定将过去的定时集中学习改成坑口业余学校，学习时间改成随班走，利用坑口闲房子上课，每班上班前学习一小时，学习完集体入坑工作。为了统一领导学习，各矿成立了坑口学委会，以克服无组织无计划现象。学委会负责组织、计划、检查学习，各委员明确分工，各有专责。学员按住宅区编为分队，每分队有分队长。过去夜校的教师是由小学教员兼任的；现在改为选举班内的职员及工人当教师。每个坑口学校的三个班每班选文化、政治、技术教员各一人。由于教员是在本班内工作的干部、职员或工人，这样可以跟班走、跟课走。
    坑口学校设立以后，参加学习的工人逐渐增加，到去年十二月，全矿建立了坑口学校十一处，夜校五处，共六十二班，学员达四千七百八十二名，打破了过去小手小脚地不能组织大量工人学习的缺点，同时也解决了教员不够的困难。几个月来，不独在提高工人文化、政治、技术水平上收到了很大成绩，而且直接推动了生产，如大成矿二坑岳德才组创送道新纪录经验，在坑口学校传播以后，使全坑各班效率都由一米提到三米多。各矿讲了保安规则以后，就加强了职工的警惕性，减少了事故；讲了劳动纪律后，克服了工人不守纪律的无组织现象。自组织坑口学校以来，工友们按时吃饭，整队上班，减少了迟到和欠勤的。此外，因为坑口工人大多数参加了学习，矿上有什么通知指示，在讲课前后几分钟就能讲完，免得像过去一般必须找干部，再找工人一层层的开会，浪费人力和时间。
    目前该矿工人教育中存在的问题，首先是教师必须提高，各坑口学校由干部、工人、职员中选出的教员，讲技术课及初级班的文化课困难较少，而讲中级、高级班的文化课困难很多。因此，该矿现在以办初级班为重点，中级班为副，高级班有地方暂时还未设立。在提高师资中，由于倒班的原因，教师们碰在一起开会研究也不容易。为解决此问题，今后有两种办法：（一）加强坑口学委会对教学方法及教学内容的研究来提高师资。（二）每个学校聘请一名专任教员。
    其次各坑口原来闲房子不多，在分班以后教室难找。现在有的坑临时将较大的房子做了些屏风隔开来上课，有的临时搭了木板房子。今后需要在坑口建立一批坚固耐久的坑口工人学校教室。此外，该矿大部分参加学习的工人还没有课本。这也是急待统一解决的问题。
