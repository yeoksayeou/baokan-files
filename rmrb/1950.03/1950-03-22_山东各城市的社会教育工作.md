Xinhua News Agency Report:

Social education work in various cities of Shandong Province has seen significant development over the past year. According to incomplete statistics, there are now 465 workers' spare-time schools across the province, with 59,194 students, of whom industrial workers account for four-fifths; 205 mass night schools, with 9,881 students; and 88 women's literacy classes, with 5,490 participants. In addition, radio stations, blackboards, street publicity, people's cultural centers, libraries, social service centers, and various exhibitions have been used to conduct publicity and education work among citizens, all of which have yielded significant results. In Jinan City alone, there are four libraries and cultural centers, which lend out an average of more than 6,060 books each month; 11 mass reading rooms, with an average of 320 people regularly participating in learning each day. More than 100,000 citizens visited the four provincial industrial, agricultural, People's Liberation Army achievements, and Soviet women's life picture exhibitions held in January.

Large Cities Universally Establish Workers' Night Schools

Since the liberation of major cities such as Jinan, Xuzhou, and Qingdao in Shandong, emphasis has been placed on employee education in the cities. The trade unions in each city, through the trade union system, have independently organized night schools in large factories. Qingdao City has now formed 78 workers' night schools, with 15,237 students. In Jinan City, factories have 18 workers' night schools, with 7,574 employees participating in learning. The education bureaus of each city instructed middle and primary schools and people's education centers to unite with the district government working groups to organize night schools for private enterprise workers, dispersed workers, and shop assistants. The two people's education centers in Qingdao City opened 17 night school classes, with 896 students; 47 municipal primary schools and 3 middle schools opened 96 adult night school classes, 19 women's literacy classes, and 29 children's classes, with a total of 6,573 students. Jinan City organized 54 night school classes, with more than 2,460 workers and shop assistants participating in learning. Among these night schools, 743 people have graduated after three months of study.

The establishment of night schools in various places has been relatively easy to address in terms of teaching materials and funding due to the importance attached to leadership. The Qingdao City Education Bureau has compiled and printed 140,000 copies of workers' cultural textbooks; teachers are mostly trade union cadres and middle school students. Jinan City also organized lectures for teachers; most schools organized management committees through democratic elections; and preliminary regular systems such as examinations, tests, roll calls, and leave applications have been established. Teaching focuses on cultural learning centered around the recovery and development of production, with cultural literacy education as the main focus and political current affairs as the supplement; classes are organized and grouped according to students' levels. In addition to dividing into nine classes, the Qingdao Zhongfang No. 9 Factory Night School also formed workshop literacy classes and mutual aid learning groups based on production teams. The Qingdao Cangkou Night School achieved good results in teaching because it implemented democratic management, full-time teachers, and a fixed curriculum system. The Qingdao Dagang People's Education Center organized 100 women students to study while making matchboxes for production, earning 2,250 kilograms of grain in two months, solving the difficulties of the people's lives and powerfully consolidating the learning organization. Each night school also organized singing teams and drama troupes to make the learning life more active. After half a year of study, the cultural level of workers and women in various places has been significantly improved. The original illiterates in Jinan City Workers' Night School can now recognize 150 Chinese characters after half a year of study, and the most can recognize 400 characters; a quarter of the students can write simple letters and diaries. After studying, employee students also played an active leading role in production and trade union organization, and participated more extensively in social activities. Students from the 18 night schools in Jinan City once served as representatives to participate in the Municipal People's Congress and the National Shop Assistants Conference, and made a general announcement afterwards, which greatly helped the awakening education of employees. After studying the labor-capital policy, the employees and students in each school gave play to the enthusiasm of production, thus improving work efficiency. For example, the daily output of employees and students of Jinan Victory Match Factory increased from 31 boxes of matches in August to 46 boxes in December. Of the 3,312 students in 46 spare-time schools in Jinan City, 1,825 have joined the trade union and 260 have joined the Youth League.

In addition, attention is paid to mobilizing and helping workers to study in terms of library reading. There are 21 libraries and reading rooms in Jinan and Qingdao, with a collection of 34,000 new books. The number of readers in Qingdao has increased every month, and has exceeded 176,000 in the past six months. The reading objects are mostly students and staff, and workers are in the third place, and they often read current affairs and policy documents. The Jinan City Cultural Center has organized more than 100 book borrowing and reading groups, regularly holds reader symposiums, exchanges reading experiences and discusses issues; and conducts mobile reading in various factories; cooperates with club work, organizes reading evenings, and conducts political education for workers and students through commemorative festivals and wall newspaper exhibitions. The drama group goes deep into the factories to help workers carry out cultural and recreational activities. It has now helped workers organize more than 20 factory drama troupes and clubs, and formed a drama and music research association. Dezhou City is organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, Trade Union, Youth Federation, Women's Federation, etc. There are six employee night schools, one women's literacy class, and twelve blackboards, which regularly carry out education and publicity on news, production, criticism, commendation, and answering questions.

Special Attention was Paid to Transforming Old Artists, Old Folk Arts, and Drama and Film Work

The social education work in various cities paid special attention to uniting and transforming old artists, old folk arts, and drama and film work. Xuzhou City established various forms of learning and meeting systems in theaters, book stalls, and teahouses, and conducted democratic and current affairs education for old artists. Two sessions of opera research classes were opened, and opera adaptation groups were organized to give play to the enthusiasm of artists. Jinan City has banned the performance of old dramas that promote feudal superstition, and helped the First Theater rehearse adapted Peking operas such as "The Fisherman's Hate" and "Chuang Wang Enters Beijing." The political consciousness of old artists is gradually increasing. The Jinan artists took the initiative to participate in the work of supporting the front line in the Huaihai Campaign and participated in the work of donating money; some drama troupes have implemented democratic management and established regular political and cultural learning systems. In Qingdao City, eight cinemas have screened 39 Soviet films in the past six months, with 600,000 viewers; 71 old films, with 300,000 viewers, and the audience of progressive films is gradually increasing.

Qingdao City used photos, comic strips, physical charts and other materials on a large scale to organize four exhibitions on Soviet construction, Qingdao liberation, American imperialist atrocities, and health and epidemic prevention, with 100,000 viewers. Through the exhibition of photos of Soviet socialist construction, the masses had a further understanding of the Soviet Union; especially the atrocities of American imperialism in Qingdao, which made the masses have a better understanding of the faces of American imperialist aggressors. More than 57,000 people have visited the city's specialty museum and aquarium in the past six months.

In addition to the above achievements, the social education work in various cities in Shandong has had the following shortcomings in the past year: (1) In the development of social education work, the mutual connection and organic cooperation of various agencies are not enough, and there is a phenomenon of each doing its own thing. Some cities still lack unified leadership. Therefore, there is no unified plan for night school teaching. Some focus on politics, and some focus on culture. (2) Teaching cannot be combined with the actual lives of workers. For example, there is no more formal school system and curriculum in employee spare-time schools. Teaching cannot be in-depth, and there is no in-depth understanding of workers' lives in factories. Therefore, it is impossible to link teaching with the actual situation of workers. Teachers are also mostly not fixed, and there is not enough understanding between teachers and students, so the effect of teaching unity cannot be achieved. (3) Teaching materials have not yet been systematized. Some mix politics and culture; some teaching progress is unplanned. Some classes and groups are forcibly unified without taking into account the level and requirements of students, so that the power of learning organizations has not been well used to promote learning. Under the guidance of the Education Department of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, various social education departments are gradually paying attention to correcting the above shortcomings.

　　山东各城市的社会教育工作
    【新华社讯】山东省各地城市社会教育工作，一年来有很大的发展。据不完全统计，现全省各城市已有工人业余学校四百六十五处，参加学习的人数有五万九千一百九十四人，其中产业工人占五分之四；群众夜校二百零五处，学员九千八百八十一人；妇女识字班八十八处，参加学习的有五千四百九十名。此外并利用广播电台、黑板报、街头宣传、人民文化馆、图书馆、社会服务处和举办各种展览会等，对市民进行宣传教育工作，都收到很大成效。仅济南市就有图书馆、文化馆四处，平均每月借出书籍六千零六十余册；群众阅览室十一处，每天平均有三百二十人经常参加学习。一月中举办的四次全省工业、农业、解放军战绩和苏联妇女生活画片展览会前往参观的市民达十万人以上。
    大城市普遍设立工人夜校
    山东自济南、徐州、青岛等大城市先后解放以后，即重视城市的职工教育。各市职工会通过工会系统，先后在大型工厂中自力组织夜校。青岛市现在已组成工人夜校七十八处，学生一万五千二百三十七人。济南市各厂有工人夜校十八处，参加学习的职工有七千五百七十四人。各市教育局指示各中、小学和人民教育馆联合各区区政府工作组，组织私营企业工人、分散工人、店员等夜校。青岛市两所民众教育馆开办夜校十七班，学生八百九十六人，四十七所市立小学和三所中学开办了成人夜校九十六班、妇女识字班十九处、儿童班二十九处，共有学员六千五百七十三人。济南市组织了五十四个夜校班，有工人、店员二千四百六十余人参加学习。徐州市开办了二百七十七个固定夜校，学员有一千二百○一人。在这些夜校中并有经过三个月学习的七百四十三人毕业。
    各地开办夜校由于领导上重视，教材和经费问题比较容易解决。青岛市教育局编印了工人文化课本十四万册；教师多由工会干部和中学学生担任。济南市并组织了教员讲座；各校多数采用民主选举的方式，组织了管理委员会；初步地建立了正规的考试、测验、点名、请假等制度。在教学上是围绕恢复与发展生产开展文化学习的中心，教学内容以文化识字教育为主，政治时事为辅；按学生程度编班分组，进行学习。青岛中纺九厂夜校除划分九个班外，并以生产小组为单位组成了车间识字班和互助学习小组。青岛市沧口夜校由于实行了民主管理、专任教员和固定课程制度以后，教学效果获得很好的成绩。青岛大港民教馆组织一百个妇女学员，一面学习，一面糊火柴盒进行生产，两个月赚粮二千二百五十斤，解决了一部分群众生活的困难，有力地巩固了学习组织。各夜校并组织歌咏队、剧团，使学习生活趋于活跃。各地工人、妇女经过半年学习后，文化程度显著提高。济南市工人夜校原来的文盲，经半年学习后现已能识一百五十个生字，最多的能识四百个字；有四分之一的学员已能写简单的信和日记。职工学员学习以后在生产和组织工会方面也起了积极带头作用，并更广泛地参加了社会活动。济南市十八个夜校里的学员，曾经充任代表参加市各界人民代表会议和全国店员会议后，作了普遍传达，对职工的觉悟教育帮助很大。各校职工学员学习了劳资政策，发挥了生产的积极性，因而也提高了工作效率。如济南市胜利火柴厂职工学员八月份每日出三十一箱火柴，十二月份增加至四十六箱。济南市四十六处业余学校三千三百一十二个学员中，已有一千八百二十五名参加了工会，二百六十人参加了青年团。
    此外，在图书阅览方面，注重动员和帮助工人学习。济南、青岛图书馆、阅览室共二十一处，藏新书三万四千册。青岛阅读人数每月增加，半年来已逾十七万六千名以上，阅读对象以学生、职员为最多，工人占第三位，经常阅读时事、政策文件。济南市文化馆，已组织借书阅览小组一百余个，经常召开读者座谈会，交流读书心得和讨论问题；并在各工厂开办巡回阅览；配合俱乐部工作，组织读书晚会，和通过纪念节日举办壁报展览，对工人和学生进行政治教育。戏剧组则深入工厂，帮助工人开展文化娱乐活动。现已帮助工人组织了工厂剧团和俱乐部二十余个，并组成了戏剧音乐研究会。德州市由市教育局、职工会、青联、妇联等组织了职工夜校六处、妇女识字班一处、黑板报十二处，经常进行新闻、生产、批评、表扬和解答问题的教育宣传。
  特别注意了改造旧艺人、旧曲艺和戏剧电影工作
    各地城市的社会教育工作，特别注意团结和改造旧艺人、旧曲艺和戏剧电影工作。徐州市在各剧院、书棚、茶社建立了各种不同形式的学习与会议制度，对旧艺人进行了民主、时事教育。开办了两期戏曲研究班，组织了戏曲改编组，以发挥艺人的积极性。济南市已禁演了宣传封建迷信的旧剧，帮助第一剧场排演了“渔夫恨”、“闯王进京”等改编京剧。旧艺人的政治觉悟正日渐提高，济南艺人在淮海战役中，主动地参加支援前线的慰问工作；参加献金工作；有的剧团已实行民主管理，建立了经常的政治和文化的学习制度。青岛市八个电影院半年来放映苏联影片三十九部，观众达六十万人；旧影片七十一部，观众三十万人，进步影片的观众逐渐增加。
    青岛市大规模利用照片、连环画、实物图表等组织关于苏联建设、青岛解放、美帝暴行和卫生防疫等展览会共四次，观众达十万人。通过苏联社会主义建设照片的展览，使群众对苏联有了进一步的认识；尤其是美帝在青岛的暴行，使群众对美帝侵略者的面目有了更进一步的认识。该市特产馆和水族馆，半年来前往参观的人数在五万七千人以上。
    一年来山东各地城市社会教育工作除获得以上成绩外，尚存在以下一些缺点：（一）在开展社会教育工作中，各机关的互相联系有机配合不够，存在着各自为政的现象。有的城市尚缺乏统一的领导。因此，在夜校教学上就没有统一的计划，有的偏重政治，有的偏重文化。（二）教学不能结合工人生活的实际。如职工业余学校中尚没有较正规的学制、课程，在教学上不能深入，没有深入工厂了解工人生活，因此也就不能在教学上联系工人实际。教员也多不固定，师生间了解不够，不能收教学合一之效。（三）教材还没有系统化。有的政治与文化混合；有的教学进度无计划。有些分班编组强求统一，而没有照顾到学生的程度和要求，以致未很好地运用学习组织力量来推动学习。上述缺点，在山东省人民政府教育厅的指导下，各社教部门正逐步注意纠正中。
