Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 6th -- In the Lüda area, women have become an important force in economic and cultural construction. Currently, more than 21,000 women in Lüda are participating in industrial production, accounting for 18 percent of the total number of workers in the area. Among them, 2,411 female workers are engaged in electrical, lathe, shipbuilding, foundry, chemical, spinning, driving and other work in heavy industrial sectors, and like their male counterparts, they have achieved excellent results in various production competitions and new record-breaking movements. Thanks to the method devised by female worker Bi Guizhi, the output of the fishing net factory has increased by 60 percent. Since the implementation of female worker Li Shirong's rationalization proposal in the second shift of the Dalian Textile Factory, the output of cloth has increased by 18 percent. Last year, women accounted for 59 of the 855 industrial production models in the Lüda area, and one was selected as a labor hero. In terms of participating in agricultural production, women in Lüda have been widely mobilized. Of the more than 96,800 rural women with labor power in the area, 86,365 participated in production last year. They not only engage in auxiliary labor such as soil beating, but also begin to master agricultural production technology. In Lushun, only 35 women held plows during the spring plowing last year, but by the autumn plowing, the number had increased to 344. Currently, 40,000 women in the area have joined mutual aid groups, and 21, including Zhang Guilan and Yin Yuerong, have been selected as labor heroes and models. In addition, women in Lüda are particularly active in sideline production such as raising chickens and pigs, collecting wild vegetables, and gathering seaweed for famine relief.
    In the literacy campaign widely carried out in the Lüda area, women are active participants. According to statistics, 130,000 women in the area have participated in this movement. At the Lüda Literacy Model Award Conference held last year, women accounted for 218 of the 551 model students; and 60 women were selected as model mass teachers. At present, they can generally recognize four to five hundred to more than a thousand characters, and 9,800 women in Lushun City have learned to write, keep accounts, and read newspapers, accounting for 30 percent of all women literacy students. In order to transform the old-style midwives and train new obstetricians, the Lüda Women's Federation has planned and held health lectures, and organized rural women's health teams to carry out publicity and education on fertility and daily hygiene. As women's participation in production work increases, childcare is also developing. At present, 16 formal nurseries have been established in the area, with 643 children receiving education and care.

　　旅大区廿四万妇女参加经济文化建设
    涌现英雄模范三百余名
    【新华社大连六日电】在旅大地区，妇女已成为经济、文化建设中的一支重要力量。目前旅大妇女参加工业生产的已达二万一千余名，占全区工人总数的百分之十八。其中有二千四百一十一名女工在重工业部门中从事电气、车床、修船、翻砂、化学、旋盘、驾驶等工作，并且也同男工一样地在历次生产竞赛和创造新纪录运动中创造出优异的成绩。渔网工厂由于采用了女工毕桂芝想出的方法，使产量提高了百分之六十。大连纺织工厂二班自实行了女工李世荣的合理化建议后，布的产量即提高了百分之十八。去年旅大全区八百五十五名工业生产模范中，妇女占五十九名；并有一名被选为劳动英雄。在参加农业生产方面，旅大妇女已普遍动员起来。全区有劳动力的九万六千八百余个农妇中，去年就有八万六千三百六十五人参加了生产。她们不仅从事打土等辅助劳动，而且开始掌握农业生产技术。旅顺去年春耕时只有三十五名妇女扶犁，到秋耕时即增加到三百四十四人。现全区已有四万妇女参加了互助组，其中张桂兰、阴月荣等二十一名且被选为劳动英雄模范。此外旅大妇女们从事养鸡、养猪、采野菜、赶海菜备荒等副业生产的，则尤其普遍。
    在旅大区普遍开展的识字运动中，妇女是积极的参加者。据统计全区已有十三万妇女参加了这一运动。去年举行的旅大识字奖模大会上，全部五百五十一名模范学员中，妇女就占了二百一十八名；并有六十名妇女被选为模范群众教师。目前，她们一般地都能认得四、五百个到一千多个字，旅顺市并有九千八百名妇女学会书写、记账，看报，占全部妇女识字学员的百分之三十。为了改造旧的收生婆，培养新的接生人员，旅大妇联总会曾有计划地举办了卫生讲座，并组织了乡村妇女卫生队，作生育和日常卫生的宣传教育。由于妇女们参加生产工作的日益增多，儿童保育事业也正在开展中。现全区已设立正规的托儿所十六处，有六百四十三个孩子在里面受着教养。
