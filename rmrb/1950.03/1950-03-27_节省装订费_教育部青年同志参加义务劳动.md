　　Saving Binding Costs
    Youth Comrades from the Ministry of Education Participate in Voluntary Labor
    [This Newspaper's Report] To commemorate World Youth Week, the young working comrades of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government organized a voluntary labor activity of binding newspapers on Sunday (the 26th). Among the eighty-three young working comrades who participated in this voluntary labor, there were Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and non-Party and non-League young comrades. They worked enthusiastically and intensely for two and a half hours, resulting in the binding of more than two hundred bound volumes of newspapers for the Ministry of Education's library, saving the binding cost of five hundred jin of millet. Vice Minister Qian Junrui praised this outstanding voluntary labor in the department's production bulletin on the same day, saying: "Today's voluntary labor points out a working path for our Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and all staff. That is: forgetting personal interests, using the spirit of collectivism, and serving the people intensely and happily in a specific task. All our work should learn from this example."
