　　According to a report from the Gongbei Customs of Guangdong: "At 12:25 AM on the 6th of this month, our customs anti-smuggling vessel Xinghai, in accordance with navigation regulations, with red and green lights on, was patrolling the sea at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta. When it reached the vicinity of Coloane, Macau, the Portuguese troops suddenly and without any reason opened fire with dense artillery, hitting the Xinghai vessel with more than 200 bullets, causing considerable damage. Sailor Shi Chengji had his left middle finger shot off. At that time, our other vessel, the Luxun, was anchored offshore and was also fired upon by the Portuguese troops. In addition, there were about a hundred fishing boats anchored there, and they were also hit by stray bullets, injuring many fishermen. In order to ensure the safety of the fishing boats, we did not retaliate in any way." This provocative and violent act by the Portuguese troops is clearly to protect smuggling and deliberately massacre the Chinese people, making them enemies of the Chinese people. Since our army liberated South China, the Portuguese side in Macau has repeatedly harbored bandits, secret agents, and smugglers, infringed upon our country's sovereignty and interests, and engaged in provocative acts hostile to our country, which has become increasingly serious recently. This time, they even fired on our customs patrol boats, injuring our personnel. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life in the capital were extremely outraged.

　　澳门葡军包庇匪特走私
    竟射击我缉私关艇
    首都各界闻讯愤慨万分
    【新华社二十三日讯】据广东拱北海关报告：“本月六日夜十二时二十五分，我海关缉私艇星海号，按照航行规定，着红绿灯向三角洲口海上出巡，至澳门路环附近，葡军竟无故突然以密集炮火我向射击，星海号艇中机弹二百余发，损坏颇重，水手石成基左手中指被击断。当时，我另一艇鲁迅号在海外抛锚，亦遭该葡军射击。另在该处尚泊有渔船约百余只，竟亦受流弹袭击，受伤渔民甚多。为照顾渔船安全，我未有任何还击。”葡军此种挑衅暴行，显系包庇走私，并有意屠杀中国人民，与中国人民为敌。自我大军解放华南后，葡方在澳门包庇匪特私枭走私、侵犯我国主权及利益、敌视我国之挑衅行为，已屡见不鲜，近更变本加厉；此次竟射击我缉私关艇，伤我人员。消息传来，首都各界人士莫不愤怒万分。
