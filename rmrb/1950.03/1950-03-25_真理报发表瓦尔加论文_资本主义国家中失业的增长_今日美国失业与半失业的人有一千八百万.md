Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th (TASS): *Pravda* published an article by Varga entitled "The Growth of Unemployment in Capitalist Countries." In this article, he wrote: Since the decline of American industry began in the autumn of 1949, the number of unemployed in capitalist countries has been rapidly increasing. According to official (and very incomplete) statistics, the total number of unemployed in the United States increased from 2.7 million in January 1949 to 4.5 million in January 1950. In January of this year alone, the number of unemployed in the United States increased by almost one million (that is, from 3,489,000 in December of last year to 4,480,000). In other capitalist countries, with the worsening of the economic crisis, the number of unemployed has also greatly increased compared to the end of 1948. In Belgium, West Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, the number of unemployed has doubled; in France, it has increased two-fold, and so on.

However, it would be absolutely wrong to regard unemployment in capitalist countries as merely the result of a growing crisis, as merely a temporary phenomenon. Capitalism and unemployment are inseparable. The plight of the unemployed is terrible. Long-term unemployment plunges millions of people into hunger and misery, turns formerly skilled workers into paupers, and then brings infectious diseases and high mortality rates among the workers.

The sad fate of the unemployed weighs heavily on employed workers, making them constantly fear for tomorrow. Those who have jobs today are always in danger of becoming unemployed tomorrow.

Only when millions are slaughtering each other and millions more are manufacturing munitions for this slaughter can capitalist society provide workers with jobs! But even then, not all workers have jobs. Take the United States as an example. According to official statistics, there were more than one million unemployed in 1943 and 700,000 fully unemployed in 1944; but the actual numbers were much larger. The post-war period is characterized by the fact that unemployment figures are concealed even more carefully than in the past. To prove this, Varga analyzed the statistics of unemployment in the United States and concluded that the army of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed in the United States today is not 4.5 million, as officially stated, but 18 million.

Varga wrote: The rapid increase in the number of unemployed in capitalist countries last year will continue this year. The economic crisis in capitalist countries is maturing, which is particularly clear in the case of the United States.

Since the role of the United States in the economy of the capitalist world is so great, the development of the crisis within its borders cannot but cause the development of crises in other capitalist countries, many of which have not yet recovered their economies after the war.

The number of unemployed in the capitalist world today, together with the semi-unemployed, is about 45 million; obviously, this number will increase further. This huge army of unemployed clearly proves that capitalism has completely declined and that the capitalist system is a major obstacle to any progress. Only by eliminating this system and replacing it with a new socialist system is it possible to eliminate forever the incurable diseases of capitalism, such as the anarchy of production, crises, and unemployment.

Only socialism—as has been proven by the great experience of the Soviet Union—can guarantee every worker the conditions to work for the welfare of society and for a prosperous and civilized life.

　　真理报发表瓦尔加论文
    资本主义国家中失业的增长
    今日美国失业与半失业的人有一千八百万
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：真理报刊载瓦尔加一篇以《资本主义国家中失业的增长》为题的论文，他在该文中写道：自从一九四九年秋季美国工业的衰落开始以后，资本主义国家的失业人数已在急速地增加着。根据官方（这是很不完全的统计）称：美国全部失业者自一九四九年一月的二百七十万增加到一九五○年一月的四百五十万。单单今年一月份内，美国失业人数就差不多增加了一百万人（按即由去年十二月的三百四十八万九千增至四百四十八万人）。在其他资本主义国家，随着经济危机的恶化，失业人数比一九四八年末也大为增加。在比利时、西德、日本、荷兰、瑞士各国，失业人数已增加了一倍；在法国则已增加了两倍等等。
    然而，如果把资本主义国家的失业认为只是正在成长中的危机的结果，认为只是暂时的现象，那就绝对错误了。资本主义与失业是分不开的。失业者的处境是可怕的。长期的失业使千百万的人民陷于饥饿和悲惨的境地，把以前的熟练工人变成了穷汉，随后又把传染病与高度死亡率带到工人中间。
    失业者的可悲命运沉重地压着在业工人，使他们老是恐惧着明天。今天有工作的人们总是处于明天要成为失业者的危险中。
    只有当几百万人在互相屠杀而另有几百万人在为这一屠杀制造军火时，资本主义社会才能给工人以工作！但是，即使在那个时候，也不是所有工人都有工作的。举美国为例，根据官方统计，一九四三年就有一百万以上的人失业，一九四四年有七十万全失业者；但是实际数字要大得多。战后时期的特征是：失业数字比过去隐瞒得更厉害了。为证明这一点，瓦尔加分析了美国失业人数的统计，并得出结论说：今日美国全失业和半失业的大军，不是如官方发表的四百五十万，而是一千八百万。
    瓦尔加写道：资本主义国家去年失业人数的急速增加，在今年仍将继续下去。资本主义国家的经济危机正在成熟，这一点在美国这个例子中特别清楚地显出来了。
    由于美国在资本主义世界的经济中所起的作用是如此巨大，其国内危机的发展就不能不引起其他资本主义国家危机的发展，这些国家中有很多在战后还没有恢复它们的经济。
    现在资本主义世界中的失业人数连同半失业者在内约有四千五百万；显然，这个数字将更进一步地增加。这支庞大的失业军清楚地证明了资本主义已完全没落，证明了资本主义制度是任何进步的大障碍。只有清除这个制度而代以新的社会主义制度，才可能永远消灭诸如生产的无政府状态、危机和失业等资本主义的不治之症。
    只有社会主义——像已被苏联的伟大经验所证明了的那样——才能保证每一个工人为社会的福利，为繁荣的文明生活而工作的条件。
