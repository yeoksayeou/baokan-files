　　Tianjin Second Tax Bureau
    Focuses on Inspecting Trade Tax
    Businesses in Violation and Those Evading Taxes Have Paid Back Taxes
    [This newspaper dispatch] To prevent tax evasion and strengthen management, the Second Tax Bureau of the Tianjin Tax Bureau has conducted focused surprise inspections of warehouses and businesses that withhold trade taxes, and has achieved considerable results and experience. The bureau has jurisdiction over six districts, with 1,272 withholding warehouses. Due to the large number of households and the complexity of the situation, the bureau adopted a method of focused inspection in November and December of last year to prevent tax evasion and illegal operations, inspecting a total of 341 businesses. As a result, 192 households were found to have evaded taxes. The methods of tax evasion varied widely, such as: 1. Withholding taxes without paying them, embezzling the funds, or only paying a portion. 2. Under-deducting or not deducting trade taxes to attract trade business through tax evasion. 3. Delaying the payment of taxes or changing the transaction date to make a profit. 4. Rounding down the transaction amount so that each transaction is below the taxable threshold. 5. Colluding with traders to underreport the full amount when paying taxes at the border, and the warehouse does not deduct the difference in tax after the transaction. 6. Claiming that taxable goods after the transaction were taken away by the customer. 7. Engaging in illegal operations, receiving and paying interest. 8. Operating privately without obtaining a business license. 9. Engaging in business outside the scope of their license. 10. Having two sets of books, or combining the front and back books, or using temporary notes and recording them later.
    Due to careful planning and the conscientious work of the inspectors, this inspection revealed that the 192 businesses in violation should pay a total of 118,354,616 yuan in back taxes; 106,599,740 yuan has now been paid into the treasury. Furthermore, because this focused inspection was aimed at educating general illegal businesses, it had a great impact. Many warehouses in mid-December voluntarily declared and requested to pay back taxes without penalty. Of the 309 households that voluntarily declared, 53 had evaded taxes, and the amount of back taxes due was 13,006,891 yuan; 24 households have now paid back taxes, amounting to over 9 million yuan.
    The targets of the bureau's inspection are divided into three categories: 1. Those with information reported by the public. 2. Those who pay less tax and are suspected of tax evasion. 3. Those who are suspected of violations discovered during the inspection. The inspection methods are also treated differently depending on the situation. Special attention should be paid to strict inspections of businesses that use a mixture of new and old accounting methods and those with front and back books.
  Experience in Preventing Tax Evasion: Publicize Policies, Strictly Inspect, Organize the Masses to Expose and Report
    In the course of this inspection, some experience was gained in preventing tax evasion. The first is to overcome the past phenomenon of not going deep enough into the work. For example, when inspecting the Huaxing Warehouse in the Second District, six cadres were assigned to investigate for three days, which truly had the effect of punishing one as a warning to a hundred. This caused some households to voluntarily declare and pay back taxes, and to request to understand the tax policies of the People's Government. The tax bureau then, based on the facts of the inspection, revealed the tricks of warehouse tax evasion at several meetings of withholding trade tax warehouses, while publicizing tax policies to educate general businessmen, and reiterating the government's leniency policy, calling on all households to confess and voluntarily report. The combination of publicity and inspection resulted in 309 households voluntarily declaring tax payments or back taxes. The second is to organize the warehouses in a step-by-step and planned manner according to the actual situation. Organize them into small groups of 15 households by region, democratically elect a group leader, and establish an internal meeting reporting system to regularly study tax policies and issues related to withholding trade taxes. Tax cadres are assigned to manage segments, each leading about 100 households (7-8 small groups), regularly understanding the situation, similar to the nature of resident factory workers. If a household is found to be suspected of tax evasion, an investigation and study is conducted. At the same time, a mass reporting system is established, first relying on organized masses such as shop assistants' unions and pedicab workers. When inspecting warehouses, it is necessary to combine the efforts of the Public Security Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Bureau to implement a unified inspection. This can not only identify tax evaders, but also clear out hidden landlord-gangster elements within the warehouses, and correct illegal out-of-scope operations.

　　天津税务第二分局
    重点检查行商税
    违章及漏税商户已补纳税款
    【本报讯】天津市税务局第二分局为防止漏税，加强管理，对代扣行商税的货栈和商户，进行了重点突击检查，已获得相当成绩和经验。该分局共辖六个区，有代扣行栈一二七二户。由于户数多，情况复杂，该局为防止偷漏税款及违章经营，在去年十一、十二两月份中，便采取重点检查的方式，共检查了商户三四一家，结果发现有偷漏税款情形者达一九二户。其偷税方式五花八门，如：一、扣税不缴，中饱私囊，或仅缴一部分。二、少扣或不扣行商税，以偷税来招揽行商生意。三、延期缴纳税款，或改变交易日期以牟取利润。四、将交易额化整为零，使每笔交易都不足征税点。五、串通行商在境口纳税时不报足数，行栈交易后，亦不扣差额税。六、交易后应纳税的货品，诡称客商取去。七、非法经营，收付利息。八、不领营业证照，私自营业。九、业外经营。十、具有两套账，或前后账合一，或临时记条，事后作账。
    这次检查，由于事先计划周密，检查人员工作认真，查出违章商户一九二家中，共应补纳税款一一八、三五四、六一六元；现已纳库一○六、五九九、七四○元。又由于这次重点检查旨在教育一般不法商户，故影响很大，许多行栈在十二月中旬曾纷纷自动申报，请求补税免罚。计自动申报的三○九户中，漏税者五三户，应补税款一三、○○六、八九一元；现已补缴纳库者二四户，税额九百余万元。
    该局检查的对象分三种：一、有群众检举资料者。二、缴款较少有偷漏嫌疑者。三、检查中临时发现有违章嫌疑者。检查方式亦依不同情况，分别对待。特别对设有新式簿记与旧式账混用之商户和有前后账的商户，应进行严格检查。
  防止漏税经验：宣传政策严格检查  组织群众揭发检举
    在此次检查过程中，获得了一些防止漏税的经验。首先是克服了过去工作不深入现象，例如在二区查华兴栈时，即调干部六人查了三天，真正收到了惩一警百之效。使有的户自动申报补税，并要求了解人民政府的税收政策。税务局遂根据检查的事实，分别在几次代扣行商税的行栈会议上，揭发了行栈漏税的花样，同时宣传税收政策以教育一般商人，并重申政府的宽大政策，号召各户坦白自报。宣传检查结合进行，结果便陆续有三○九户自动申报纳税或补税。其次是根据实际情况，有步骤、有计划地把货栈组织起来。按地区每十五户编为一小组，民主选出组长来，建立内部会议汇报制度，经常研究税收政策，及代扣行商税问题。并指定了税工干部分段管理，每人约领导百户左右（七八个小组），经常了解情况，类似驻厂员性质。发觉某户有漏税嫌疑，即进行调查研究。同时，还建立了群众性的检举，首先是依靠有组织的群众如店员公会、三轮车工人等。在检查货栈时要结合公安分局及工商分局，实行一元化的检查。这样不仅可以查出漏税者，还可以清查出货栈内潜伏的地主流氓分子，并可纠正非法的业外经营。
