The task of introducing foreign revolutionary literary masterpieces to China is important and arduous. The influence of this work is broad and profound, so those who undertake this work—translators and publishers—must be extremely serious and treat it with the utmost responsibility and conscientiousness.

However, recently some publishers have printed and distributed things that are poorly translated and full of errors. Feng Zou's "Complete New Translation of How the Steel Was Tempered" published by Shanghai Chaofeng Publishing House is an example.

I carefully read it from beginning to end, but the first sentence on the first page confused me: "The exercises assigned to you before the festival, those who have finished them, stand up and take a look."

I didn't understand who was standing up, and what they were standing up to look at. I had to check the original Russian text. I found that the meaning of the original was "Before the festival, those of you who came to my house to recite the lessons, stand up!" As for the phrase "...the exercises assigned to you, those who have finished them..." there isn't even a shadow of it in the original text.

Same page, sixth line - "Father Vasily's eyes spied on the postures of the four boys"; why did Father Vasily have to "spy"? Was he afraid of these four elementary school students? And what does it mean to "spy on...postures"?

But the original actually says: "Father Vasily's small eyes focused on these four little figures."

Same page, ninth line, "Rascal," is translated as "This is not allowed."

Even more ridiculous is the tenth line on the same page: "Doesn't smoke, nonsense, damn it, who crushed the tobacco shreds in the dough and scattered them here?" Readers, imagine, tobacco shreds in the dough, crushed by someone, what a strange thing! In fact, the original is "You scoundrels, you don't smoke, so who scattered the tobacco in the dough?"

Fifteenth line, the priest is checking their pockets. So: "Three children began to turn their bags over and put them on the table." How can bags (clothing pockets) be placed on the table? Looking at the original, it is actually: "Three children began to take things out of their pockets and put them on the table."

Sixteenth line, the original is: "The priest carefully checked every seam of their pockets, wanting to find traces of tobacco..." But this translator translates it as "The priest squinted his eyes, wanting to find a bit of tobacco crumbs...".

Eighteenth line: "Beast, why are you always standing there making faces?" This is the priest scolding his elementary school students. The original is "Why are you standing there like a wooden doll?" The translator's imagination and reasoning power here are too amazing. How could a student facing a major disaster dare to "make faces"? He could only be frightened "like a wooden doll."

This "Complete New Translation of How the Steel Was Tempered," which is three hundred and forty pages long, has a total of eighteen lines on the first page. In addition to the errors pointed out above, there are many other errors, such as "neck" translated as "chest," "looking at" translated as "patrolling," "pierced" translated as "injected," "Okay, now let's take a look" translated as "Now it's clear," "shirt" translated as "coat," etc., plus random additions and alterations, there are more than twenty errors in total. It's simply wrong line after line, with multiple errors per line.

Chaofeng Publishing House's printing and distribution of such a poor translation proves that it is completely irresponsible to the author and readers. Adding a boastful translator's postscript at the end is even more inappropriate!

From this poor translation, we see that the philistine's miasma of seeking profit only still exists in today's publishing industry. This miasma must be cleared away.

　　潮锋出版社出版的所谓“全部新译本”《钢铁是怎样炼成的》
    朱子平
    把外国的革命文艺名著介绍到中国来的工作，是重要而艰巨的。这种工作的影响是广大而深入的，所以担当这种工作的人——译者和出版者——必须十分严肃，拿出最大的负责态度和认真的精神来对待它。
    但是近来有些出版者却把译笔拙劣错误百出的东西印行出来。上海潮锋出版社的冯驺译“全部新译本钢铁是怎样炼成的”就是个例子。
    我细心地从头读下去，但第一页第一行第一句就令我莫明其妙：“在节日前交给你们做的练习题，做好了的，站起来看看。”
    我不明白是谁站起来，站起来看看什么。我只好拿俄文原本核对一下。我发现原文的意思是“在节日前，你们到过我家里背课的人，站起来！”至于“……做的练习题，做好了的……”这些字句，原文里连个影子也没有。
    同页第六行——“瓦西里神父的眼睛在四个男孩子的姿态上窥视着”；为什么瓦西里神父要“窥视”呢？难道他怕这四个小学生么？而且“在……姿态上窥视”，这究竟作何解释？
    但原文其实是“瓦西里神父的小眼睛集中在这四个小人物身上。”
    同页第九行“无赖”，被译成“这是不允许的。”
    更滑稽的是同页第十行：“不吃烟，胡说，他妈的，是谁把面酵里的烟丝，捏碎散在这儿呢？”读者试想，面酵里的烟丝，被人捏碎了，这是什么怪事呀？其实原文是“混账东西，你们不抽烟，那么是谁把烟丝撒在面酵里的？”
    第十五行，神父检查他们的衣袋了。于是：“三个小孩开始把袋子翻了过来，放在桌子上。”袋子（衣袋）怎样可以放到桌子上呢？再看原文，却是“三个孩子开始把口袋里的东西拿出来放在桌子上。”
    第十六行，原文是：“神父细心检查他们的口袋的每一条缝，想发现烟丝的痕迹……”但是这位译者译成“神父紧?着眼睛，想找出一点烟草屑……”。
    第十八行：“畜生，为什么老是摆着鬼脸站着呢？”这是神父骂他的小学生的话。原文是“你干么木偶似地站在那儿？”这儿译者的想象力和推理力也太惊人了，一个大祸临头的小学生还敢“摆着鬼脸”么？他只能吓得“木偶似地”了。
    这个全文三百四十页的“全部新译本钢铁是怎样炼成的”第一页，一共十八行，除了前面指出的错误之外，还有许多错误，如“脖子”译成“胸膛”，“看着”译成“巡视着”，“穿透了”译成“注射着”，“好，现在我们倒来看看”译成“现在明白了”，“衬衫”译成“上衣”等等，加上胡乱添改的，一共有二十多处。简直是行行有错，一行数错。
    潮锋出版社把这样低劣的译品印行出来，证明对作者和读者完全不负责任。后边还加了一篇大吹其牛的译后记，更是不应该的！
    从这个低劣的译品，我们看到了今天出版界依然存在着惟利是图的市侩的乌烟瘴气。这种乌烟瘴气是必须加以廓清的。
