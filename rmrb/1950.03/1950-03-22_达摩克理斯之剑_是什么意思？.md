　　What is the meaning of "The Sword of Damocles"?
    Question: In the first part of Malenkov's report at the Moscow celebration of the October Revolution last year: "The sword of poverty and unemployment, like Damocles, does not hang over the heads of the Soviet people." What does this mean? (General Association of In-Service Cadre Study Committee, Suiyuan Province)
    Answer: Damocles is a transliteration of Damocles, a person from Syracuse (located on the southeast coast of Sicily) in the fourth century BC. Damocles was flattering King Dionysius I, so the king hosted a banquet for him, but he hung a sharp sword over Damocles' head with a horsehair, making Damocles feel threatened and unable to enjoy the meal in peace. The original meaning of this典故 (allusion) is to show that one can never have a moment of peace in front of the emperor. Malenkov used this sentence in his report to illustrate that the Soviet people are not threatened by poverty and unemployment.

　　“达摩克理斯之剑”是什么意思？
    问：去年莫斯科庆祝十月革命节大会上马林科夫报告的第一部分内：“没有达摩克理斯的贫穷与失业之剑悬在苏联人民头上。”这是什么意思？（绥远省在职干部学习委员会总会）
    答：达摩克理斯系Damocles之译音，是纪元前四世纪，塞拉库斯地方（位于西西里岛东南海岸）的一个人。达摩克理斯向国王丁尼修斯一世献殷勤，国王就设宴款待他，可是，却在达摩克理斯头上用一根马尾悬利剑一把，使达摩克理斯时感威胁，不能安心享受这顿美餐。这个典故原意是表示在皇帝面前决不能有一刻安逸。马林科夫报告中借用这句话，是说明苏联人民没有贫穷与失业的威胁。
