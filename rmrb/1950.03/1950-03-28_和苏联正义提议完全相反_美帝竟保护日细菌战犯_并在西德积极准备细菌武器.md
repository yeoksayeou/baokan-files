　　Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Moscow Radio on the 24th, citing a Reuter dispatch from New York, reported: MacArthur Headquarters has agreed to protect former Japanese Army Generals Shiro Ishii, Kasahara Shiko, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, the notorious Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals whom the Soviet government proposed to be tried by an international tribunal. They visited MacArthur Headquarters, and senior U.S. military officials received them well, declaring that the U.S. military will rely on cooperation with them in the future. U.S. officers also told them that MacArthur expressed great interest in their military experience and the results of their bacteriological warfare research. At the same time, they were told that MacArthur Headquarters had decided to provide them with security guarantees, and for this purpose, they would be directly protected by the U.S. military police.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: TASS, The Hague, March 26th: According to a report in the Dutch Communist Party newspaper "De Waarheid," the United States is conducting preparations for bacteriological warfare in West Germany. Some bacteriologists, biochemists, and chemists working in West German scientific institutes are engaged in special research under the command of the U.S. Department of the Army. The U.S. falsely claims that this work is commissioned by the Medical Department of the Army, which is the same method used by Japan. Among them are Dr. Lan and Professor Felix, members of the Tübingen Biochemical Institute, who are engaged in research to promote the growth medium of toxic bacteria. Dr. Fies, a member of the same institute, is ordered to study the fastest-growing group of bacteria. It is well known that Dr. Seiss, a lecturer at the Hamburg Chemical Institute, is developing new heart poisons. The United States provides German bacteriologists with equipment, chemicals, and money to engage in their criminal activities.

　　和苏联正义提议完全相反
    美帝竟保护日细菌战犯
    并在西德积极准备细菌武器
    【新华社二十七日讯】据莫斯科二十四日广播引电通社纽约消息：麦克阿瑟总部已答应保护前日本陆军将领石井四郎、笠原辛雄、若松次郎与北野政藏，他们四人是苏联政府提议组织国际法庭进行审判的恶迹昭彰的日本细菌战犯。他们拜谒过麦克阿瑟总部，美军高级官员曾予以很好的接待，并宣称美军将来指靠与他们的合作。美国军官并且告诉他们，麦克阿瑟对于他们的军事经验和研究细菌战的成果表示极大兴趣。同时又告诉他们，麦克阿瑟总部已决定给予他们以安全的保证，为此目的，并将直接由美国军事警察特别保护他们。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社海牙二十六日讯：据荷兰共产党机关报“真理报”报道，美国正在西德进行细菌战争的准备工作。在西德科学研究所工作的一些细菌学家、生物化学家和化学家，奉美国陆军部之命，正在从事特别研究。美国伪称这项工作是陆军部军医处所委托的，这种掩饰手段正是日本的手法。就中有杜平根生物化学研究所所员兰博士与费里克斯教授，他们从事研究促进毒性细菌生长的媒介的工作。同所所员费斯博士奉令研究繁殖最速的一群细菌。众所周知，汉堡化学研究院讲师赛许博士正在调制新的心脏毒剂。美国供给德国细菌学家以装备化学品与金钱从事他们的罪恶活动。
