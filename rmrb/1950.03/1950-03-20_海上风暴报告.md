　　Sea Storm Report
　　By Jiao Fuchun

　　Everything on land gradually became clear. The plainclothes men disappeared, and they gradually approached the other corner of the island.

　　Little Li suddenly jumped up and said, "Great! Our own people!" Little Li shouted with all his might. The comrades on the shore had already spotted the cap badges of the two of them and kept waving to them. Zhang Lixue collapsed as if he had cramps.

　　× × × ×

　　The Second Section of the Military Headquarters received a telegram from the × Army × Division forwarded by the Corps: "A platoon of the × Regiment lost at sea while sailing to × Island dispatched two people to deliver a message, who have reached our division's position."

　　The news quickly reached the regiment, battalion, and company. The phones in the regiment kept urging the battalion one after another: "Get ready, go quickly!" Battalion Commander Sun was busy here and there checking nautical charts, sending people, calling the communication soldiers, getting boats and plainclothes, and ordering the baking of sesame cakes...

　　According to the map orientation, the ship sent out found the island on the first day, but could not see anyone and dared not rashly climb up.

　　The next day, they landed again to search, searching every stone crevice, but finally found a pickaxe, a bullet box, and a shoe.

　　The searchers were discouraged. Everyone guessed: "They were probably annihilated by the enemy." But there was no sign of battle on the island, no corpses, no bullet casings.

　　On the 19th, Zhang Lixue and Li Youyu returned to the military headquarters.

　　The chief of the Second Section told them the search results. Everyone's hearts contracted as if touched by ice, and their minds were dizzy.

　　"A bullet box and a shoe... it's over, they must have fought on the east side of the island. I knew someone advocated fighting to the end when we left, the whole platoon must have sacrificed. It's hateful that I was delayed in the water for four days and four nights..." Zhang Lixue sat down and began to feel heartbroken.

　　The section chief asked, "What did you eat these days?"

　　Zhang Lixue said, "We ate the old man's two mu of sweet potatoes!"

　　"What? There's an old man?" The section chief asked in surprise.

　　Zhang Lixue raised his head and said, "Yes! A father and son!" The section chief hurriedly took out a roll of nautical charts and asked, "The small house is over there."

　　Zhang Lixue felt slightly relieved, "It's on the west side!"

　　"Oh! Probably wrong. The island we searched definitely had no small house and no people."

　　Based on his four days and nights of drifting experience, Zhang Lixue could roughly remember the location of the island in his mind. His eyes also glanced at the nautical chart. He estimated the location of the boarding point, then to the northwest, then to...landing...finally he pointed to an island: "Is it here?"

　　The section chief took a closer look. North × Island was close to another island to the south called South × Island. The section chief asked, "Did you see another island to the south?"

　　He said, "About three li away there is another island." Zhang Lixue confirmed that the difference between North × Island and South × Island was just the words "north" and "south."

　　Battalion Commander Sun took Zhang Lixue's hand and boarded the ship that was about to leave immediately.

　　The forty people's soldiers had not sacrificed; they were still completely alive and preparing for battle.

　　On the fifteenth day, he saw a boat sailing towards them and thought it was an enemy boat. The sallow-faced and emaciated comrades perked up when they heard about the battle and entered their positions. Soon, two more boats were found slowly approaching from the northwest. The company commander told everyone: "It looks like the enemy is up to no good today. Coming from our direction, this must be a conspiracy. Comrades! Today is the chance to capture a boat!"

　　The ship from the northwest gradually approached, waving small red flags and blowing horns. Some people were half-believing: "Could it be our own ship?" But upon closer inspection, the people on the ship were all in plainclothes, and everyone concluded they were bandits. The boat from the north had sailed to the southeast, and the boat from the northwest was getting closer and closer. The command was passed down in the fortifications: "Prepare!" The guns were cocked, the grenades were pulled, ready to capture the boat.

　　The two boats approached the island and circled around. After a while, everyone seemed to hear a faint voice: "Old Gao! Old Gao!" followed by: "Little Zheng! Little Zheng!" This was calling Company Commander Gao and his communication soldier. Company Commander Gao stood up from the fortifications and took a closer look, and couldn't help but shout: "Ah, isn't that the battalion commander on the boat?" Company Commander Gao ran and shouted: "Our battalion commander is here, our battalion commander is here!" The soldiers all jumped out of the fortifications and ran towards the battalion commander one by one.

　　The battalion commander looked at the comrades with long hair and sunken eyes, and his tears were even harder to stop.

　　Gao Wenbin tightly held Battalion Commander Sun's hand, and his first sentence was: "Battalion commander, it's all my fault as the company commander!" The battalion commander said: "It's all my fault as the battalion commander." When soldier Wang Juxiang heard that the battalion commander was here, he jumped up, forgetting about the grenade on his hand, which fell to the ground and smoked white. He picked it up and threw it far away, where it exploded.

　　The six hundred catties of rice they brought were given to the old man, who was so grateful that he didn't know what to say. He shed tears. Suddenly he thought of the bandits. He said: "The bandits will come to rob after you comrades leave!"

　　Farewell to the old man, the whole platoon quickly boarded the ship. Battalion Commander Sun went over to shake hands with everyone one by one, and everyone lowered their heads in sorrow. Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang took out things and distributed them one by one, saying: "Comrades, smoke first to sober up!" Everyone grabbed the sweet potato leaves in cloth bags and threw them into the sea. Then they distributed oranges, sugarcane... The ship sailed towards "home." The old man on the island waved that small axe and said: "It has done a great job! It has done a great job!"

　　The ship gradually moved away from the island. Company Commander Gao said: "We have been on the island for a full half month!" The battalion commander said: "I feel like it was longer than half a year!" The company commander said: "I counted the days one by one."

　　The enemy fired machine guns in the distant east, and the tracer tips dragged red lines across the sky. The soldiers happily said: "The enemy is setting off firecrackers to send us off!"

　　As they were about to land, the battalion commander ordered all the signal flares they had brought to be fired into the air, red, purple, and white, dazzling and bright. This was a signal of victorious return, the light illuminating the sea, illuminating the high sky, illuminating the hearts of the forty-two people's soldiers, and illuminating our bright and splendid future.

　　February 18, 1950, in Shanghai

　　The battalion commander came by boat to pick them up. The soldiers all jumped out of the fortifications and ran towards the battalion commander one by one.

　　海上风暴报告
    矫福纯  作
    陆上的一切逐渐的明朗起来，便衣不见了，他们逐渐靠近岛的另一角。
    小李忽然跳了起来说：“好了！自己的人哪！”小李用尽了所有的力量喊了一句，岸上的同志们早已发现他们二人的帽徽，向他们不断招手。张立学这时像抽了筋一样瘫倒了。
    ×      ×        ×        ×
    军司令部二科接到兵团转来的×军×师一份电报：“上×岛因航海失事的×团一个排，派出二人送信，已达本师阵地。”
    消息迅速的到达团、营和连，团里的电话一个跟着一个的催营：“准备好了，快去！”孙营长东一头西一头的忙着查海图派人，叫通讯员，搞船和便衣，又下命令烙烧饼……。
    按照地图方位，派出去的船，第一天岛是找到了，但看不见人影，不敢冒失的爬上去。
    第二天又登陆找，搜索部部队石硼缝也找遍了，最后找到一把洋镐，一个子弹箱和一只鞋。
    寻找的人心都冷了。大家猜测：“大概被敌人歼灭了。”可是岛上并无丝毫战斗迹象，没有尸体，没有弹壳。
    第十九号，张立学、李友玉回到了军部。
    二科长把寻找结果告诉了他们。大家的心像触到冰一样立即收缩了，脑子昏昏沉沉的。
    “一个子弹箱和一只鞋……完了，他们一定是到东面岛上拼了。我知道临走时就有人主张去拼上，全排都牺牲了。可恨我在水里耽误了四天四夜……。”张立学一坐下去，就伤起心来。
    科长问道：“你们这些日子吃什么？”
    张立学说：“吃那家老百姓的二亩地瓜！”
    “怎么？还有一家老百姓？”科长惊奇的问。
    张立学抬起了头说：“是！爷儿俩！”科长急忙拿出了一卷海图，追问道：“小房在那边。”
    张立学心里略略安了一下，“在西头！”
    “噢！大概错了。我们找的那个岛决无小房和人家。”
    张立学凭他四昼夜的飘流体验，在他脑中的那岛的位置，大体还能记得，他的眼也瞅上了海图，他约摸着上船地点，后来到西北，又到………登陆………最后他指到一个岛上：“是不是这里？”
    科长仔细一看，北×岛紧靠着南面还有一岛叫南×岛。科长问道：“你们看南面再有没有岛了。”
    他说：“大约有三里还有一岛。”张立学证实了，南北×岛是差在上下两字上。
    孙营长拉着张立学的手登上了立即要开走的船。

    四十个人民战士并没有牺牲，他们还完全活着，并准备着战斗。
    第十五天，他看到一只船向他们开来，都以为是敌人的船。面黄饥瘦的同志们听说战斗，抖擞起精神进入阵地。不久，西北面又发现两只船徐徐开来，连长告诉大家：“看样子今天敌人是要搞鬼了，从我们方向来，这一定是阴谋，同志们！今天捉船的机会到了！”
    西北面的船逐渐靠近了，在船上摆着小红旗，吹着号，有人半信半疑：“莫非是自家的船？”可是再近一点看，船上的人全是便衣，大家断定是土匪。北面的船已开到东南面，西北的船也愈靠愈近。工事里传下了口令：“准备！”枪顶上了顶门火，手榴弹拉出了弦，准备捉船。
    这两只船靠近岛子，也围着转开了，片刻，大家似乎都听到：“老高呵！老高呵！”的微弱声音，接着又是：“小郑啊！小郑啊！”这是喊高连长和他的通讯员，高连长从工事里站起来定睛一看，情不自禁的喊出：“啊船上那不是营长吗？”高连长一面跑一面喊：“咱们营长来了，咱们营长来了！”战士们都从工事跳出来，一个个向营长跑去。
    营长看看长头发，凹眼睛的同志们，眼泪更难止住。
    高文彬紧拉着孙营长的手第一句话就是：“营长，全怨我当连长的不好！”营长说：“都怨我当营长的不好。”一班战士王举祥听说营长来了，高跳起来，套在手上的手榴弹都忘了，掉在地下冒白烟，他拾起来向远方扔去爆炸了。
    把带来的六百斤大米，给了老百姓，老头感激的不知说什么才好，他流泪了。忽然他想起土匪，他说：“同志们走后，土匪要来抢的！”
    别了老翁，全排迅速的上船，孙营长一个个的过去握手，握着谁都难过的低下头。张排副拿着东西一个个的分了说：“同志们先抽烟醒醒！”大家抓出了装在布袋的地瓜叶，抛到海中。然后分橘子、甘蔗……。船向着“家”的方向开去。岛上老头挥摇着那把小斧头说：“它有功啊！它有功啊！”
    船逐渐远离岛，高连长说：“在岛上整整半月了！”营长说：“我觉得比半年还长！”连长说：“我是一天一天的算着过日子。”
    敌人在遥远的东方打起了机枪，曳光尖拖着一条条的红线在空中飞过。战士们欢乐的说：“敌人放鞭炮欢送我们了！”
    快要登岸了，营长命令把所带的信号弹都打在空中，红的、紫的、白的，晃晃耀眼，这是胜利荣归的信号，光彩照亮了大海，照亮了高空，照亮了四十二个人民战士的心，照耀着我们光辉灿烂的前途。

    营长乘船来接他们。战士们都从工事跳出来，一个个向营长跑去。
