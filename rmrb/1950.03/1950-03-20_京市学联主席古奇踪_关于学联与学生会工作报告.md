　　Beijing Municipal Student Federation Chairman Gu Qizong
    Report on the Work of the Student Federation and Student Union
    [Further News] The following is an abstract of the report by Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Student Federation, on the work of the Student Federation and Student Union:
    The central task of the student union is to do a good job in studying New Democracy. In 1950, the work of student unions in various schools should include the following four items:
    Four Tasks of the Student Union
    (1) Promoting Learning: The main task is to call on students to carry out the study of New Democracy and learn their regular courses well. The reform of the academic system and curriculum must be led by the People's Government's educational authorities. Improvements in teaching methods and exchanges of learning experiences can be provided to teachers and students through various means organized by the student union. In addition, lectures, seminars, visits, and trips can be appropriately organized, but they should be conducted without hindering learning and in a way that helps with the study of regular courses. (2) Organize students to engage in spare-time vegetable production to improve nutrition, so that students have sufficient energy to study. Under the leadership of the school administration, we must mobilize students to participate as much as possible on a voluntary basis, think of more ways, work together, and persevere. (3) With the assistance of the school administration, appropriately organize extracurricular cultural, recreational, sports, and social service activities. These activities should be combined with learning as much as possible, and should not become a burden on learning. (4) Cooperate with the school administration to hold parent-teacher conferences or home visits, etc., to help improve the relationship between students and their families.
    Organizational Form of the Student Union
    The organizational form of the student union should not be too complicated. Each class and grade should elect representatives in proportion to the number of people to form a representative assembly, which will determine the guidelines and tasks for a semester and elect an executive committee. The executive committee can convene representative meetings attended by cadres from each class and grade to discuss regular work and promote a democratic style. The work of the student union should be carried out under the close cooperation and guidance of the school administration and teachers. Representative meetings should invite them to attend and provide guidance, or cooperate with the school to convene teacher-student representative meetings.

    关于学联与学生会工作报告
    【又讯】北京市学联主席古奇踪关于学联与学生会工作的报告的摘要如下：
    学生会的中心任务是搞好新民主主义的学习。一九五○年各校学生会的工作应有下列四项：
    学生会的四项工作
    （一）推动学习：主要是号召同学开展新民主主义的学习，学好正课。关于学制、课程的改革，必须人民政府教育机关领导进行。对教学方法的改进和学习经验的交流可通过学生会组织用各种方式提供给教师和同学。此外可适当组织讲演、座谈、参观、旅行等活动，但要在不妨碍学习，并且对于学习正课有帮助下进行。（二）组织同学搞好课余种菜生产以改善营养，使同学有充足精力进行学习。我们要在学校行政的领导下，在自愿原则下尽量动员同学参加，大家多想办法，共同努力，坚持下去。（三）在学校行政的协助下，适当组织课外文娱、体育及社会服务活动。这些活动应尽量与学习相结合，而不要成为进行学习的负担。（四）配合学校行政，举行恳亲会或家庭访问等，协助改进同学与家庭的关系。
    学生会组织形式
    学生会组织形式不应过于繁复。各班、级按人数比例推出代表组成代表大会，决定一学期方针与任务，选举执委会。执委会可召开由各班、级干事参加的代表会议，讨论经常工作，发扬民主作风。学生会工作应在学校行政及教师的密切配合与指导之下进行。代表会议应请他们列席指导，或与校方配合，召开师生代表会议。
