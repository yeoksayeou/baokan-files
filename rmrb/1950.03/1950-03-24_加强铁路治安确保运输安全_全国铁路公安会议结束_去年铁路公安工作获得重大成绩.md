    [By Our Reporter] To determine the organizational structure of railway public security departments and to deploy public security work for 1950, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened a National Railway Public Security Conference in Beijing from March 6th to 15th. It was clearly stated that railway public security departments are an integral part of the railways and are administratively under the leadership of the Minister of Railways. The staffing must be streamlined to reduce expenditure and maximize work efficiency. At the meeting, Feng Ji, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, reported on the summary of railway public security work last year. He pointed out that the railways have basically established law and order, ensuring the safety of military transportation and passenger and freight transportation, and have achieved considerable success in mobilizing the masses to protect the railways. Last year, 17 enemy and puppet railway special party branches were disbanded, and 191 enemy agent cases were solved (according to statistics from Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Shanghai), and 12 radio stations were seized. In addition, 3,353 drug offenses and 5,313 theft offenses were solved; in the Northeast, 119 cases of privately carrying sulfur and explosives, 772 cases of stealing railway equipment and stealing public grain, and 424 cases of reporting corruption were investigated. The perpetrators involved in the above cases were dealt with according to the severity of their circumstances. At the meeting, Minister Teng and Vice Minister Wu of the Ministry of Railways, and Vice Minister Yang of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government all attended and spoke, unanimously pointing out the importance of public security work in the Ministry of Railways and the entire economic construction, calling on everyone to work with peace of mind, strive to study and improve themselves, and further promote the spirit of relying on the masses to protect the railways, and complete the glorious task of protecting the railways.
