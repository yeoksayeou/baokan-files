[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to promote students' after-school production and improve their living standards, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Guiding Production in Government Offices established a School Production Guidance Committee in late February. This committee is responsible for guiding after-school production in all universities and middle schools in the city. Fewer units are involved in the university sector; however, in the middle school sector, as of now, 74 public and private middle schools have established school production committees and begun organizing after-school production. The School Production Guidance Committee, based on specific circumstances, has coordinated with relevant authorities to secure 1,200 mu of land in the suburbs for distribution to various schools for vegetable cultivation. Land handover and measurement work has already begun, and cultivation will commence within days. To accommodate female students and younger students, efforts will be made to allocate land closer to the city to girls' middle schools and junior high school students. For expenses such as well-digging, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizer that schools cannot cover, the government will provide loans to help resolve them.

The majority of middle school students in this city need improved nutrition and better health. The only good way to solve this problem now is to rely on students' own production. This is how the old liberated areas solved it in the past. After the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference called for the development of school production, students in various schools have shown great enthusiasm. Among the aforementioned 70-plus schools, the proportion of students signing up to participate in production is generally above 90%. However, there are also a few schools where the administration does not pay enough attention to this issue and adopts a perfunctory attitude, considering this work an "extra burden." This thinking should be quickly corrected. Agricultural production in schools, mainly vegetable cultivation, will appropriately improve middle school students' nutrition and health conditions after the harvest, and their labor perspectives and labor habits will also be cultivated at the same time.

　　改善学生生活培养劳动观点
    京各中学组织课余生产
    各校学生情绪高涨踊跃报名
    【京市新闻处讯】京市机关生产指导委员会为了推动学生课余生产，改善学生生活，已于上月下旬成立学校生产指导委员会，负责指导全市大中学校课余生产。大学部分单位较少；中学部分截至目前止，已有公私立中等学校七十四校分别成立了学校生产委员会，开始组织课余生产。学校生产指导委员会已根据具体情况，与有关机关在郊区接洽好土地一千二百亩分配各校，以便从事种菜。现已开始接管、丈量工作，日内即可进行耕种。为了照顾女生及年幼学生，将尽可能作到将距城较近的土地分与各女中及初中学生使用。至打井、农具、种子、肥料等所需款项，各校不能解决者，政府将以贷款帮助解决。
    本市中等学校学生大部需要提高营养、增进健康，现在解决这个问题惟一的好办法，是依靠学生自己生产。过去老解放区即是这样解决的。北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议号召开展学校生产后，各校学生情绪很高，前述七十余校中签名参加生产的学生，一般都在百分之九十以上。但也有少数学校，行政上对这问题不够重视，采取敷衍态度，认为这项工作是一种“额外负担”，这种思想应该迅速予以纠正。学校进行农业生产，主要是种菜，收成后，中学生的营养及健康状况将得到适当改善，他们的劳动观点及劳动习惯亦会同时培养起来。
