　　Irresponsible Storage by City and County Warehouses
    Serious Losses of Public Grain in Rehe Province
    Amount to a Staggering 1.89 Million Jin in One Year
    [Our Dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily, the 1949 public grain storage work in Rehe Province suffered from serious theft, embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and a lack of organization and discipline, resulting in an astounding loss of 1.89 million jin of public grain to the state. In twenty-one counties and banners (excluding Chengde City) in the province, there were as many as eighteen incidents of theft. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 196,832 jin of public grain was stolen. In Jianping County alone, 84,667 jin of public grain was stolen. In terms of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, there were already eighty-four people who embezzled public grain, with twenty-two in Luanping County alone. In Jianping County alone, six embezzlers embezzled 143,129 jin of public grain. Currently, a total of over 327,600 jin of embezzled public grain has been verified. In addition, the unauthorized use of public grain was also very serious. For example, Lingyuan County used 251,300 jin of public grain without authorization, and Qinglong used 211,934 jin. It is estimated that thirteen counties and banners privately used a staggering 1,029,786 jin of public grain. At the same time, due to poor storage, the amount of moldy and rotten public grain in twenty-one counties and banners reached 340,936 jin. In total, the province lost more than 1,895,000 jin of public grain in 1949, causing an astounding loss of state wealth. The Northeast Daily published a short commentary on this, suggesting that local governments should strengthen their leadership over grain work, conduct thorough inspections, and give due punishment to bad elements.

　　各市县保管仓库不负责任
    热河公粮损失严重
    一年来竟达百八十九万斤
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：热河省一九四九年公粮保管工作存在严重的偷盗、贪污、渎职及无组织无纪律现象，造成国家一百八十九万斤公粮的惊人损失。该省二十一个县市旗（承德市在外）被偷盗的竟有十八处之多，据不完全统计共被盗去公粮十九万六千八百三十二斤。仅建平一县即被偷盗公粮八万四千六百六十七斤。在贪污渎职方面，已有八十四名贪污公粮人员，滦平一县即有二十二名；只建平一县六名贪污分子即贪污公粮十四万三千一百二十九斤。现在已查明贪污的公粮共计三十二万七千六百余斤。另外不经批准，随便动用公粮现象亦非常严重。如凌源一县即动用公粮二十五万一千三百余斤；青龙动用二十一万一千九百三十四斤。计十三个县旗私自动用公粮竟达一百零二万九千七百八十六斤。同时因保管不良，以致霉烂的公粮，在二十一个县旗中已有三十四万零九百三十六斤。总计全省一九四九年共损失公粮一百八十九万五千余斤，造成国家财富惊人损失。东北日报对此曾发表短评，建议当地政府亟应对粮食工作加强领导，深入检查，并给予坏分子以应有的惩处。
