　　Industrial and Commercial Tax Rice Price: 1,300 Yuan per Jin
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau has determined that the rice price for industrial and commercial tax payments for the second half of 1949 is 1,300 yuan per jin, which is 50 yuan lower than the treasury rice price of 1,350 yuan today (31st). It has also been decided that this price will not change during the payment period. Industrial and commercial businesses that have paid their taxes in advance and overpaid due to the higher rice prices in the past few days can bring their original receipts to the various tax bureaus for a refund. Furthermore, the Municipal Tax Bureau, in order to accommodate the difficulties faced by industrial and commercial operators in making concentrated payments of seasonal taxes, previously entrusted the People's Bank of Beijing to sell tax-deductible rice coupons on its behalf. However, now that the industrial and commercial tax and property tax payment period is underway, taxpayers can directly go to the bank to make payments without having to go through an extra procedure. Therefore, the sale of these rice coupons will be suspended from today.

　　工商业税款米价  每斤一千三百元
    【京市新闻处讯】京市一九四九年下半年度工商业税缴款米价，已经市税务局核定每斤为一千三百元，较今（三十一）日金库米价一千三百五十元低五十元。并决定在缴款期内不再变动。凡已提前缴了税款的工商户，其因前几日米价高而多缴的部分，可持原收据至各税务分局退款。又市税务局前为照顾工商业者集中缴纳季节性税款的困难，曾委托本市人民银行代售税款折米券，日前因正值工商业税及房产税纳库期间，纳税人已可迳赴银行缴款，无须多费一道手续，故此项折米券自即日起暂停出售。
