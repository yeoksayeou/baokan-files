　　Ministry of Finance and State Taxation Administration Commends
    Northeast Tax Revenue Exceeds Target
    Key lies in strengthening leadership and inspection, overcoming the view of underestimating tax revenue, and simplifying internal procedures.
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Lu Chaoqi reports: According to the tax revenue reports of the Northeast Tax Administration for January and February, the region's tax revenue in January exceeded the original target by 61.84 percent, and February exceeded it by 32.45 percent. Looking at the task completion of various provinces and cities in January, Rehe Province exceeded the original target by 129.55 percent, Harbin City exceeded it by 105.11 percent, and Anshan City exceeded it by 90.5 percent. In addition, cities such as Shenyang, Benxi, and Fushun, as well as provinces such as Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, Longjiang, and Liaoxi, all exceeded the target by 38 to 82.35 percent. For this reason, the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration of the Central People's Government specially circulated the experience of the Northeast's tax revenue work in January and February to tax authorities at all levels across the country, calling on tax workers at all levels to learn from the Northeast's experience and emulate the Northeast's tax revenue work.
    From the Northeast region's tax revenue exceeding the target in January and February, the following four points of experience were obtained: (1) To complete and exceed the task, it is necessary to strengthen the inspection and supervision of lower-level tax authorities. In order to truly grasp the situation and help lower levels solve difficult problems, the Northeast Tax Administration transferred a group of cadres to participate in the meetings of directors of provincial and municipal tax bureaus, and went deep into counties and cities to specifically help them overcome difficulties and deploy tasks. This not only improved the cadres' confidence in completing tasks, but also enabled them to report situations to higher levels in a timely manner. (2) The amount of tax revenue collected depends on the efforts of the tax authorities and whether the Party and government responsible cadres lead the tax work as a central task. If tax personnel work hard and the leading organs grasp tightly, all resistance will be overcome, tax evasion will be reduced, and tax revenue will increase; conversely, if the cadres' conditions are poor, or the work mood is abnormal, and the leading organs do not grasp tightly, the work resistance will be great, and the tax revenue will decrease. For example, Andong City, which has 5,925 industrial and commercial households, collected the largest amount this time due to the municipal government's real emphasis on tax work, assisting the tax bureau in mobilization in many ways, and the tax cadres' conscientious work, approximately equivalent to slightly less than one-third of Shenyang, which has 29,000 industrial and commercial households, a little more than one-third of Harbin, which has 23,500 industrial and commercial households, and more than three and a half times that of Changchun, which has 10,000 industrial and commercial households. Initially, the Northeast Tax Administration thought that the city's burden might be too heavy, and sent people to investigate twice, but the results proved that the city's industrial and commercial burden in January and February averaged only 12.8 percent, which had not yet reached the level that should be levied. (3) It is necessary to overcome the view of underestimating tax revenue. Generally, cadres in the Northeast region have attached great importance to tax revenue work. The main key to overcoming cadres' underestimation of tax revenue is the importance attached to tax revenue work by Party and government organs from top to bottom, and the universal strengthening of leadership. Last year, the Northeast Bureau, the Northeast People's Government, and the Ministry of Finance issued instructions on strengthening tax revenue work, and the responsible cadres of each province personally grasped the leadership, and many county and mayors personally participated in the collection committee, thus reversing the general cadres' view of underestimating tax revenue. Breaking through false accounts, taking the initiative in social opinion, and launching discussions and criticisms at the People's Representative Conference are effective ways to overcome capitalists' complaints about heavy burdens. When Liaodong Province's Andong City collected industrial and commercial income tax in February last year, it originally planned to collect 600 million Northeast currency, but merchants complained about the heavy burden and organized petitions. After repeated investigations by the tax bureau, false accounts were broken through. Facts proved that those who organized the petitions were the industrial and commercial households with the largest false accounts. The capitalists had nothing to say. After obtaining reliable materials, it was arranged to collect 5 billion, and the result was not only exceeded, but the merchants said it was reasonable. Jilin City broadcast the materials of false accounts and tax evasion on the radio, reported them at the representative meetings of all sectors, and launched discussions and criticisms. Farmer Wang Fenlin said: "Farmers' burden accounts for 20 percent of the output, and there are war services, preferential treatment for military families, and helping veterans." He also exposed instances of tax evasion in various districts on the spot, and proposed that farmers pay grain and silver taxes, unite as one, and support national economic construction, which moved the entire audience. (4) Simplifying internal procedures, reducing internal staff, and sending most of the capable cadres to do external work, strengthening anti-smuggling inspections, and changing the past work style of most cadres sitting high in the agency, busy with paperwork and affairs, are also important reasons for overfulfilling the tax revenue task.

　　财政部税务总局通报表扬
    东北税收超过任务
    关键在于加强领导检查，克服轻视税收观点，简化内部手续。
    【本报讯】记者陆超祺报道：根据东北区税务管理局一、二两月份的税收报告，全区一月份税收已超过原定任务的百分之六一·八四，二月份超过百分之三二·四五。从各省市一月份完成的任务来看，热河省超过原定任务的百分之一二九·五五，哈尔滨市超过百分之一○五·一一，鞍山市超过百分之九○·五。此外，沈阳、本溪、抚顺等市及辽东、吉林、松江、龙江、辽西等省，均超过百分之三八至八二·三五。为此，中央人民政府财政部税务总局特将东北一、二两月税收工作的经验，通报全国各级税务机关，号召各级税务工作人员学习东北经验，向东北税收工作看齐。
    从东北区一、二两月超过任务的税收工作中，得到以下四点经验：（一）要完成并超过任务，必须加强对下级税务机关的检查与督促。东北区税局为了确实掌握情况，帮助下级解决困难问题，曾抽调一批干部参加各省市税务局长会议，并深入到县市去，具体帮助他们克服困难，布置任务。这不仅提高了干部完成任务的信心，而且能及时向上级反映情况。（二）税收的收多收少，取决于税务机关人员的努力程度和党、政负责干部是否把税收工作作为中心工作来领导。如果税务人员努力工作，领导机关抓的紧，一切阻力便会克服，偷漏税就会减少，税收就会增多；反之，如果干部条件差，或者工作情绪不正常，领导机关抓的不紧，工作阻力大，税收就要减少。例如，拥有五千九百二十五户工商业的安东市，因为市政府真正重视税收工作，多方面协助税局动员，以及税收干部工作认真，所以此次征收的数字最多，约相当于拥有二万九千工商户的沈阳的三分之一弱，为拥有二万三千五百工商户的哈尔滨的三分之一强，超过拥有一万工商户的长春的三倍半。最初东北税务管理局以为该市的负担可能过重，曾先后两次派人去调查，结果证明该市一、二两月的工商负担平均只达百分之一二·八，还没有达到应征的程度。（三）必须克服轻视税收观点。东北区一般干部已很重视税收工作。克服干部轻视税收观点的主要关键，是党政机关自上而下的重视税收工作，普遍加强领导。去年东北局、东北人民政府和财政部曾对关于加强税收工作分别发出指示，各省负责干部均亲自掌握领导，很多县、市长亲自参加征收委员会，因而扭转了一般干部轻视税收的观点。突破假账，在社会舆论上争取主动，在人民代表会议上展开讨论批评，这是克服资本家喊重的有效办法。辽东省安东市去年征收二月工商业所得税时，原布置征六亿元东北币，商人喊重，组织请愿。后经税局反复调查，突破假账。事实证明，组织请愿的，都是假账最大的工商户。资本家无话可说。取得可靠材料后，布置征五十亿元，结果不仅超过而且商人反说合理。吉林市将假账瞒税材料，在电台广播，在各界代表会议上报告，并展开讨论批评。农民王芬林说：“农民负担占产量的百分之二十，并有战勤、优待军属、帮助荣军等。”他并当场揭发各区瞒税实例，提出农民交粮银纳税，团结一致，支援国家经济建设，全场均为之感动。（四）简化内部手续，减少内勤人员，把大部得力干部去做外勤工作，加强缉私检查，改变过去大部分干部高坐机关，忙于文牍及事务的工作作风，也是超额完成税收任务的重要原因之一。
