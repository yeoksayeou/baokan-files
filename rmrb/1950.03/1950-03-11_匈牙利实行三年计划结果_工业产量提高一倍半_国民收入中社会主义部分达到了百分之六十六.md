Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th: TASS, Budapest, March 5th: The Hungarian Workers' Party organ, Free People's Daily, recently published an article by Vas, Chairman of the State Planning Bureau, discussing changes in Hungary's national income, stating: Hungary's national economy at the end of the Three-Year Plan was originally targeted to increase by 82.3 percent compared to 1946-47, but exceeded the plan, increasing by 97 percent. Therefore, the national income in the final year of the Three-Year Plan (1949) had already exceeded the pre-war level by 24 percent. In the period from 1925-26 to 1938-39, Hungary's national income only increased by 28 percent, while during the Three-Year Plan period, it increased by an average of 32 percent per year.

Under the socialist economic system, a large portion of the national income comes from large-scale industry. During the Three-Year Plan, industrial output increased by one and a half times. In 1938, industry provided 35.3 percent of the national income; in 1946-1947, it was 35.7 percent; and in 1949, it increased to 49.2 percent. Agricultural production also progressed rapidly, increasing by 60 percent during the plan's implementation. Agriculture's percentage of the national income has decreased from 34 percent in 1938 to 27.2 percent in 1949, which is entirely in line with the Hungarian government's policy of national industrialization.

As a result of nationalization, by the end of 1949, large-scale industry, the lending system, transportation, foreign trade, and wholesale trade were all completely controlled by the state. One-third of retail trade was also controlled by the state and cooperatives. Many farmers participated in agricultural production cooperatives. Now, the socialist sector accounts for 17.8 percent of all arable land, pastures, grasslands, and forests. As a result of all this, the socialist sector reached 66 percent of the national income in the final year of the Three-Year Plan. This figure vividly illustrates that the Hungarian working people are victoriously advancing on the road to socialism.

　　匈牙利实行三年计划结果
    工业产量提高一倍半
    国民收入中社会主义部分达到了百分之六十六
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社布达佩斯五日讯：匈牙利工人党机关报自由人民报顷刊载国家计划局主席瓦斯的论文，论述匈牙利国民收入的变化称：匈牙利国民经济在三年计划终了时原定要比一九四六——四七年增加百分之八十二点三，结果超过计划，增加了百分之九十七。因此，三年计划的最后一年（一九四九年）中的国民收入，已超过战前水平百分之二十四。在一九二五——二六年到一九三八——三九年的时期中，匈牙利国民收入仅增加了百分之二十八，而在三年计划期间，却每年平均增加百分之三十二。
    在社会主义经济制度下，大部国民收入来自大规模工业，三年计划中工业产量提高了一倍半。一九三八年，工业提供了国民收入百分之三十五·三，在一九四六——一九四七年，是百分之三十五·七，而在一九四九年，则增至百分之四十九·二了。农业生产也迅速进展，在计划执行过程中，提高了百分之六十。农业在国民收入中的百分比，已从一九三八年的百分之三十四降到一九四九年的百分之二十七·二，这完全和匈牙利政府所奉行的国家工业化政策相符合。
    由于国有化的结果，到一九四九年底，大规模的工业、贷款制度、运输业、对外贸易和批发贸易，都已完全为国家所控制。三分之一的零售贸易也为国家和合作社所控制。许多农民参加了农业生产合作社，现在，社会主义部分已占全部可耕地、牧场、草场和森林的百分之十七·八。这一切的结果，使三年计划最后一年国民收入中社会主义部分达到了百分之六十六。这个数字生动地说明了匈牙利劳动人民正向社会主义的道路胜利前进。
