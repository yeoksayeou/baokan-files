　　Thoroughly Investigate the Major Embezzlement Case
    Changjiang Daily Short Commentary
    Recently, Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin, retained employees of the Wuhan branch of the Huazhong Department Store, embezzled more than 200 million yuan of public funds and have now been sent to the People's Court for prosecution. This is the largest embezzlement case discovered in the Central South region and should arouse high vigilance among responsible comrades and all staff members of our agencies.
    Embezzlement is a serious crime of corruption and damage to state property. At a time when the entire country is shifting to peaceful construction and the state's finances are extremely difficult, the defeated enemies are trying to use various methods to sabotage and create disturbances, hoping to cause us to suffer failures in economic construction; therefore, any corruption, waste, and extravagance will harm the people and benefit the enemy. Xu Zhiping and others, taking the risk, embezzled and violated the law, and there is no doubt that they must be severely punished by the people's law.
    At the same time, this incident also shows the extreme political paralysis and disorganization of the Wuhan Department Store branch's leadership. They did not pay attention to timely inspection and management education of retained personnel, nor did they have strict economic revenue and expenditure systems. When the criminal acts of these criminals were discovered, they did not actively inspect their work. After materials worth hundreds of millions of yuan were stolen, the company did not notice it, and it was still confessed by the criminals themselves. From this, it can be imagined that there must be many problems in the company's work. The Municipal People's Government and the company's higher-level competent authorities should conduct a thorough inspection of the company's work.
    All of our comrades, especially those engaged in economic work, should also learn from this lesson, pay attention to saving and inspection work, launch a struggle against embezzlement and waste, strengthen the education of all staff members in cherishing state property, establish various systems, and establish a style of being dedicated to duty and being honest and impartial.

### 彻查贪污巨案  长江日报短评

　　彻查贪污巨案
    长江日报短评
    最近，华中百货公司武汉分公司留用职员徐志平、镇沛霖等贪污公款达二亿多元，现已送人民法院究办。这是中南区屡有发现的贪污案中最大的一次，应引起我各机关负责同志及全体工作人员的高度警惕。
    贪污行为是堕落腐化与损害国家财产的严重犯罪行为。当此全国转入和平建设，国家财政经济非常困难的时候，失败的敌人正图利用各种方法进行破坏捣乱，想使我们在经济建设中遭受失败；因此任何贪污腐化，铺张浪费，都将损害人民，有利于敌人。徐志平等甘冒不韪，贪污枉法，毫无疑问，必须受到人民法律的严厉制裁。
    同时，这一事件，也说明了武汉百货分公司领导方面政治上极度麻痹与工作的紊乱，没有注意及时检查和进行对留用人员的管理教育，也没有严格的经济收支制度，当发现这些罪犯的贪污行为时，也未积极检查其工作，价值上亿元的物资遭受偷窃损失后，该公司亦并未发觉，还是由罪犯口中供出来的。由此可以想见，该公司工作中存在的问题一定很多，市人民政府与该公司上级主管机关应对该公司工作进行彻底检查。
    我们全体同志，特别是经济工作同志，亦应接受此次教训，注意节约和检查工作，展开反贪污浪费的斗争，加强对全体工作人员的爱护国家财产的教育，建立各种制度，树立克尽职守与廉洁奉公的作风。
