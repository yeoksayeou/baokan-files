A Brief Discussion of Differences of Opinion Within the Party
    By Stalin
    Translated by Cao Baohua and Zhang Qi
    The book "A Brief Discussion of Differences of Opinion Within the Party" is Stalin's essay on the relationship between the spontaneous workers' movement and socialist consciousness. It was written in 1905. It clarifies the great significance of socialist consciousness for the workers' movement, and at the same time calls on everyone not to unilaterally exaggerate the role of ideology, and not to forget the conditions of economic development and the role of the workers' movement. Together with Lenin's historically significant "What Is To Be Done?", it is a model work in the treasure house of Marxism. (Base price three yuan)
