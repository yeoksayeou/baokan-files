　　Over 14,000 Disaster-Stricken People from Hebei Relocated to the Northeast and Properly Settled

　　Under the joint leadership of the Northeast and Hebei Provincial People's Governments, over 14,500 disaster-stricken people from Hebei were successfully relocated to the Northeast by the end of last year.

　　When the disaster-stricken people entered the Northeast, they were warmly welcomed and cared for by local governments and people along the way. After the disaster-stricken people arrived in Heilongjiang and Songjiang, the local authorities were prepared and immediately resettled them, sending large carts to greet them, asking about their well-being, and helping to carry luggage and hold children. When they arrived in the villages, heated brick beds and firewood were already prepared, and they received land allocated by the local People's Government and warmly donated clothing and food from the masses. As a result, the disaster-stricken people were quickly able to start production.

　　For this, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, sent a telegram to the Northeast People's Government and people from all walks of life in Heilongjiang, expressing his gratitude.

　　河北万四千余灾民移至东北妥善安置
    在东北与河北两地人民政府协同领导下，河北一万四千五百余灾民，已于去年年底胜利地移至东北。
    当灾民们进入东北境内时，沿途受到当地政府及人民的热烈欢迎与照顾。灾民们到达黑龙江与松江等地后，当地均有准备地立即予以安置，派大车迎接，问寒问暖，帮助背行李、抱小孩。到村里时，炕席烧柴早就准备好了，并得到当地人民政府分配的土地与群众热烈捐助的衣粮，于是灾民们很快便能够进行生产。
    为此，河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席，特致电东北人民政府及黑龙江各界人民，表示谢忱。
