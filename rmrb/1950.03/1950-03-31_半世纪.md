　　Half a Century
    H. Ehrenburg

    I vaguely remember how this century was born: in the shop's beautiful windows were large X's, and the adults were talking loudly about "historic days," their faces flushed as they shouted, "A toast to the new century!" Grey-white horses stood stiffly on the snowy street corners, pulling carriages. In the warm houses on the southern bank of the Moscow River, merchant wives were already snoring. In the smoky and foul-smelling factory dormitories, workers were having nightmares even in their sleep. Dandies, grain speculators, gendarme cavalry officers, lawyers, white-haired factory owners, and young white-shirted students① all rushed to "Yar" and "Strelna" to celebrate the beginning of the century. Students in Bronnaya (a district of Moscow) drank beer, arguing until their voices were hoarse, singing, "From distant lands." A solitary female student read Chernyshevsky all night long.

    And far from Moscow, in the village of Shushenskoye in Siberia, Lenin also stayed up all night: he was busy drafting the plan for the first workers' newspaper, *Iskra* (The Spark). Perhaps he said to himself more than once: "A single spark can start a prairie fire..." Russia was silent, and no one could guess what emotions were stirring within it.

    When "Russia" was mentioned, Western bourgeois would give a forced smile. The silence of this enigmatic country, its size, and the stories of "nihilists" made him a little uneasy. He knew that Russia had a remarkable and unique writer—Count Tolstoy. But the Western bourgeois was not particularly fond of literature; he was much more concerned with loan interest and swaggering Cossacks.

    The rich welcomed the new century with high spirits. Paris, London, Berlin, New York, grand hotels were filled with clinking glasses. But people harbored ulterior motives: fighting for the last few slices of cake. France clashed with Britain in Sudan. Japan annexed Korea. Italy invaded Abyssinia. The United States seized islands in the Pacific Ocean.

    In the New Year, Britain declared war on South Africa, and the Boers fought heroically. London gentlemen were concerned about the fate of young Winston Churchill, who had been captured by the Boers. The gentlemen celebrated the new century with a new invention: they put Boer wives and children into concentration camps.

    Not to be outdone by the British, the Americans greeted the new century by completely destroying Philippine villages: they massacred Filipinos who did not want to taste the glory of being trampled under the feet of benevolent Americans and rose up in resistance.

    Disturbing news came from China: this ancient country was being divided into spheres of influence by robbers; the people rose up in resistance, this resistance, known as the "Boxer Rebellion," began on the eve of the new century. Diplomats agreed to organize a "punitive" army commanded by Waldersee. Punishing China: the Prussian aristocrat, the French Radical, Nicholas Romanov②, the London gentleman, the Japanese samurai, the Chicago businessman—who didn't want to?

    They could still unite for war, but not for peace. The International Conference was held at the Hague. Diplomats talked grandly about the need to limit armaments, but things were limited to talk, while armaments expanded more and more.

    The world of money seemed unshakable. True, the streets of French cities had trembled under the singing of "The Internationale" and the volleys of the punitive army. But the French bourgeois knew that General Galliffet, who had bathed the Paris Commune in blood, was sitting in the government next to the "socialist" Millerand. The French bourgeois still stood firm, he could get excited about the military's wrongful conviction of the innocent Dreyfus, he could applaud poets who praised chaos: he believed that the order he created was permanent. True, Liebknecht and Bebel declared that the number of Social Democratic votes was increasing. But every self-respecting German citizen firmly believed that those who voted for Liebknecht and Bebel would loyally go to war for the Kaiser and Krupp. True, strikes were constantly occurring in the United States, against the newly emerging "Steel Trust." But who did the businessman not worship money and the person with the most money—John Pierpont Morgan, the head of the "Steel Trust"?

    They: emperors and livestock dealers, bankers and colonizers, the elderly Queen Victoria and the young cotton kings, the bloodthirsty Muslim King Abdul Hamid and the killer weapons manufacturer Schneider, the French usurer and the Russian district nobility marshal, moralists in brothels and humanitarians in the colonial office—all these ghosts of the old era welcomed the new century with confidence. Emperor Franz Joseph③ recalled the past when he dealt with the storm of 1848, thinking that his apostolic empire would never be threatened again. *Le Figaro* wrote: "If the nineteenth century was the age of communist thugs and terrorist actions, the twentieth century will be the age of friendly coexistence between employers and workers."

    Magnificent automobiles appeared on the streets of many capitals, and although horses were startled, the spirits of businessmen were lifted. Zola said, "The new means of transportation will bring the peoples of all countries closer and eliminate the danger of war." But Ford was not enthusiastic about bringing people closer, but about increasing his wealth: he pioneered the continuous production of automobiles. The Edison Company contributed a clever invention to various state governments: the electric chair for executions.

    The clocks of Westminster Abbey, the Winter Palace, John Pierpont Morgan's palatial mansion, and "Cafe de Paris," where Paris stock exchange brokers dined, struck twelve. Emperor Wilhelm shouted: "Celebrate the new century!"—"Celebrate the new century!" Goloremykin④ echoed, "Celebrate the new century!" Mr. John Pierpont Morgan helpfully chimed in.

    The world, which people with copper stench all over them thought would last forever, began to stir at the beginning of this century: the fifth year proved that the Russian people did not sell their conscience, they did not want to replace the stupid and greedy landlord with the greedy and stupid factory owner.

    They kept dividing the cake, but they never divided it well. The Kaiser greatly admired Morocco, and he also coveted Ukraine. Washington got hold of Latin America. Franz Joseph coveted Bosnia⑤. The Italo-Turkish War broke out, followed by the First and Second Balkan Wars. Finally—the World War; Poland was fragmented, bloody battles were fought for "the little house at the ferry crossing," Belgium and France were scarred, the Battle of Verdun, the snow of the Carpathian Mountains was soaked with Russian blood—eight million lives were destroyed here. That's how they started the new century.

　　半世纪
    Ｈ爱伦堡
    我依稀记得这个世纪诞生的情形：店铺子漂亮的橱窗中写着老大的Ｘ字，大人们高谈阔论着“历史的日子”，脸孔红醺醺地叫着“为新世纪干杯”。马车上灰白的马僵立在积雪的街头转角上。莫斯科河南岸温暖的住宅中，商人太太已经打着鼾声了。乌烟瘴气发着恶臭的工场宿舍中，工人在睡梦中也做着恶梦。纨裤子弟、粮食投机商、宪兵骑兵军官、律师?白发的工厂老板、年青的白里子学生①都赶到“雅尔”和“斯特列尔那”去庆祝世纪的肇始。勃隆纳（莫斯科的一个区）的学生喝着啤酒，到声嘶力竭了还争论不休，唱着：“来自遥远的国家”。一个孤独的女学生读了巧尔尼雪夫斯基整整一夜。
    而远离莫斯科，在西伯利亚的苏申斯克村，列宁也是整夜没有睡：他忙着草拟第一张工人报纸《火花报》的计划。也许他不止一次地对着自己说：“星星之火可以燎原……”。俄罗斯沉默着，谁也猜不准它心中荡漾着什么感情。
    提起“俄罗斯”，西方的布尔乔亚就要假笑了。这个谜样的国家的沉默、它的规模、以及什么“虚无党人”的故事，使他有点不安。他知道俄国有一个卓越而奇特的作家——托尔斯泰伯爵。但西方的布尔乔亚不是特别爱好文学，他对借款的利息和雄纠纠的哥萨克要关心得多了。
    有钱人兴高采烈地迎接新世纪。巴黎、伦敦、柏林、纽约，高贵的大饭店中觥筹交错。人们的心中则怀着鬼胎：为最后几片蛋糕而打架了。法国在苏丹和英国发生了冲突。日本并吞了朝鲜。义大利侵入了阿比西尼亚。美国霸占了太平洋上的岛屿。
    新年中，英国宣布对南菲洲作战，布尔人英勇抗战。伦敦的绅士们关心被布尔人俘去的青年温斯顿·邱吉尔的命运。绅士们用新发明庆祝新世纪：他们把布尔人的妻子和孩子关进了集中营。
    美国人不让英国人专美于前，以彻底毁灭菲律宾的村落迎接新的世纪：他们屠杀了不想体味被踏在仁慈的美国人脚下怎样荣耀而起来反抗的菲律宾人。
    中国传来了不安的消息：这个古老的国家被强盗分成了势力圈；人民起来反抗，这次被称为“拳匪作乱”的反抗在新世纪前夜就开始了。外交家商定了组织以瓦德西为统帅的“讨伐”军。讨伐中国：普鲁士的贵族、法国的激进党人、尼古拉·罗曼诺夫②、伦敦的绅士、日本的武士、芝加哥的商人那个不想啊。
    他们为战争还可能联合起来，为和平却不可能了。海牙举行了国际会议。外交家奢谈限制军备的必要，但事情以说说为限，而军备则越扩越大了。
    金钱的世界似乎是不可摇撼的。不错，法国城市的街道曾经在《国际歌》的歌声和讨伐军的排炮下颤栗过。但法国的布尔乔亚知道把巴黎公社浸在血泊中的迦利番将军就在政府中坐在“社会主义者”米利哀朗的旁边。法国的布尔乔亚还站得很稳，他可以为了跋扈军人枉判无辜的特莱夫斯而激动起来，他可以向颂赞混沌的诗人喝采：他相信他创造的秩序是垂之永久的。不错，李卜克奈特和倍倍尔宣称社会民主党的选票日益增多了。但每个有自尊心的德国市民深信投李卜克奈特和倍倍尔票的人都会忠心耿耿地为恺撒和克虏伯而赴战。不错，美国不断发生罢工，反对新起的“钢铁托辣斯”。但是生意人那个不膜拜金元和拥有最多金元的人——“钢铁托辣斯”的首脑约翰·潘胖特·摩尔根。
    他们：皇帝和牲畜贩子、银行家和殖民者、高龄的维多利亚女皇和年青的纱花大王、渴血的回教国王阿布杜尔·哈米特和杀人武器制造家施奈德、法国的高利贷者和俄国县城的贵族团长、妓院中的道学家和殖民部中的人道主义者——所有这些旧时代的幽灵都怀着信心迎接新的世纪。佛朗茨—约瑟夫大帝③回想应付一八四八年风暴的往事，心忖此后他的使徒帝国再也不会遭到任何威胁了。《费迦罗报》写道：“如果十九世纪是共产暴徒和恐怖行动的时代，二十世纪将是雇主和工人友好共处的时代了。”
    许多首都的街道上出现了威风凛凛的汽车，虽然马骇得一跳，但生意人的精神却抖擞起来。左拉说：“新的交通工具将使各国人民接近起来，消弭战争的危险。”但福特热中的不是使人民接近，而是增加自己的财富：他创始了汔车的连续生产。爱迪生公司向各州政府贡献了聪明的发明：行刑用的电椅。
    威斯敏斯德大教堂、冬宫、约翰·潘胖特·摩尔根的富丽堂皇的公馆以及巴黎交易所经纪人在那里晚餐的“巴黎咖啡馆”的时钟打了十二下了。德皇威廉高呼：“庆祝新世纪！”——“庆祝新世纪！”高烈密金④应声答道，“庆祝新世纪！”约翰·潘胖特·摩尔根先生服务周到地附和着。
    满身铜臭的人以为永久不变的世界，在这个世纪一开始时就动荡起来了：第五年证明俄国人民没有出卖良心，他们不想用贪婪而又愚蠢的工厂老板去代替愚蠢而又贪婪的地主。
    他们一直分着蛋糕，却始终分不好。恺撒非常欣赏摩洛哥，他还垂涎着乌克兰。华盛顿把拉丁美洲弄到了手。佛朗茨——约瑟夫倾倒着波斯尼亚⑤。爆发了义（大利）土（耳其）战争，接着发生了第一次和第二次巴尔干战争。最后——世界大战；波兰支离破碎，为“摆渡口的小屋子”进行血战，比利时和法兰西疮痍满目，凡尔登大战，喀尔巴阡山的雪渗透俄罗斯的血——八百万生命在这里毁灭。他们这样开始了新的世纪。
