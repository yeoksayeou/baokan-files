Through People's Congresses, Extensively Promote Policies
	Xingtai District Actively Engages in Spring Planting
	Must Overcome Neglect of Leadership, Labor Mutual Aid

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xingtai District, Hebei, conducted a spring planting production inspection throughout the district on the 14th of this month. Spring planting has begun throughout the district. For example, in Wujiazhuang Village, all 800 mu of wheat fields have been harrowed once. In Baiquan Village, 17 out of 27 households have finished plowing their land. In Dongwang Village, 80% of the village's land has been harrowed. Throughout the district, 31 villages have planted more than 38,000 trees, and 37 villages have planted 80,000 hemp plants. Most villages in the district have finished delivering manure. In terms of sideline occupations, the cooperative community federation and village communities have arranged seat-for-grain exchanges with the masses, organizing women to weave 20,000 mats in exchange for 280,000 jin of millet. How was spring planting production launched throughout the district? (1) Through district people's representative conferences and village people's representative conferences, the government's various policies of rewarding production and getting rich were widely publicized, mobilizing villages and households to formulate spring planting production plans. In the production plans of each village and household, a common characteristic is evident: universal attention is paid to intensive cultivation, increasing fertilizer, and planting large quantities of cash crops. For example, in eight villages, including Baiquan, Wangkuai, and Tangjiazhuang, 580 mu of cotton were planted last year, and this year's plan is to plant 1,580 mu. This area was originally not accustomed to planting hemp seeds, but this year it is also planned for each person to plant eight to ten plants. The masses reflected: "Planting special crops is a win-win situation. We can benefit, and we can also contribute to the country's industrialization." (2) The leading role of party members and cadres has greatly promoted production. When mobilizing the masses to plant hemp, the fifteen party members of Dongwang Village were the first to complete the plan, and seven of them exceeded the plan, promoting the planting of 1,700 hemp plants in the whole village. Party members in Xiaowang Village, carrying more than seven jin of hemp seeds, visited households one by one, solving the seed shortage difficulties of 30 households, enabling the whole village to complete the plan of planting 1,558 hemp seeds. (3) Cooperatives support mass production. The Wangkuai Village Cooperative organized its members to weave 3,250 mats, and the Dongwang Village Cooperative organized its members to weave 650 mats, which greatly benefited the members. With the support of the district cooperative, the cooperatives in each village also prepared hemp seeds, cotton seeds, and fertilizers to solve the seed difficulties of the members. The members said: "This year's production will not be difficult." Therefore, in the spring planting work, the number of village cooperatives in the district increased from seventeen to twenty-three. However, there is a serious shortcoming in the current spring planting production in the district: the district and village authorities do not pay enough attention to the leadership of labor mutual aid. The masses already have many spontaneous small-scale mutual aid groups, but the cadres do not provide leadership. The masses ask the cadres: "When will we organize mutual aid?" The cadres say: "This matter is still under consideration." To complete the production increase plan and enable farmers to get rich, it is necessary to organize, and it is hoped that the district will pay close attention to this work.

### 通过人代会广泛宣传政策  邢台一区积极春耕  应克服轻视领导劳动互助

　　通过人代会广泛宣传政策
    邢台一区积极春耕
    应克服轻视领导劳动互助
    【本报讯】河北邢台一区于本月十四日，进行全区春耕生产检查，全区春耕已展开。如武家庄全村麦地八百亩，已普遍耙了一遍。百泉村二十七户中，已耕完地的十七户。东汪村耙完的地占全村土地百分之八十。全区已有三十一村植树三万八千多棵，三十七村栽大麻八万棵，全区大部分村庄已送完粪。副业方面，合作社区联社与村社与群众订席换粮，组织了妇女编席二万领，换回小米二十八万斤。全区春耕生产是怎样展开起来的？（一）通过区各界人民代表会与村人代会，广泛宣传政府奖励生产、发家致富的各种政策，发动村、户订出春耕生产计划。在各村与各户的生产计划中，表现出一个共同的特点：即普遍注意了精耕细作，增加肥料，及大量种植经济作物。如百泉、王快、唐家庄等八个村，去年种棉五百八十亩，今年计划种棉一千五百八十亩。这里本来不习惯种大麻籽，今年也计划每人点种八棵到十棵。群众反映：“种特种作物是一举两得的事，咱能得利，还能使国家工业化。”（二）党员与干部的带头作用，推动生产甚大。发动群众点种大麻时，东汪村十五个党员首先完成计划，并有七人超过计划，推动了全村点大麻一千七百棵。小汪村党员拿着七斤多麻籽，挨户访问，解决了三十户缺种籽困难，使全村完成点种麻籽一千五百五十八棵计划。（三）合作社支持群众生产。王快村合作社组织社员编席三千二百五十领，东汪村组织社员编席六百五十领，使社员收益很大。各村合作社并在区社扶植下，准备了大麻籽、棉籽与肥料，解决社员种籽困难。社员说：“今年生产可不困难了。”因此在春耕工作中，全区村合作社由十七个发展到二十三个。但目前在该区春耕生产中存在一个严重缺点：就是区村对劳动互助的领导很不重视。群众已有许多自发的小型互助组，干部没有领导。群众去问干部：“什么时候组织互助？”干部说：“这事还没有酝酿。”要完成增产计划，使农民发家致富，必须组织起来，望该区切实重视这一工作。（邢台地委会王周南、张玉美、郭明惠）
