【This Newspaper Special Dispatch】Reporter Tian Liu reports: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, one of North China's important steel centers, has stopped the serious waste of state property after a major inspection last autumn and winter. Valuable equipment abandoned for many years has been sorted out, and production has begun to improve.

            Plaza Piled with Valuable Equipment, Exposed to Wind and Rain, Corrosion
    The situation at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant before the inspection was very serious. There, serious waste of state property existed. For example, in the 36,000 square meter plaza of the second material area, valuable equipment, blast furnace parts, various types of steel, entire boxes of machines, air blowers, cement mixers, and lathes were piled up, exposed to wind, rain, corrosion, and rust. Equipment covering an area of 11,800 square meters had not even been inventoried. Even equipment stored in warehouses suffered huge losses due to dilapidated and leaky warehouse buildings. The full extent of the loss of state property is still being calculated and inspected as the various materials are being inventoried and sorted. However, it can be determined that the loss is unusually serious and enormous. According to verifiable figures alone, the model room lost 15% of its models, with the cost of labor and materials amounting to over 8,000 *jin* of millet. The first material area lost over 8,000 liters of various oils and over 15,000 *jin* of salt. The waste of water and electricity was even more alarming. Last August, the plant's water loss reached 45% of the total water intake. These situations were confirmed by multiple inspections of the plant by the State Council Financial and Economic Committee, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and other agencies in September, October, and November of last year.

            Main Reasons for the Losses
    The plant's leading cadres failed to provide due care for state property, did not prioritize their work, simply sat in their offices drafting plans, and did not value reasonable suggestions from employees.

    The reason that such serious losses occurred at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was, of course, due to objective reasons such as the serious chaotic situation left over from history. However, the fundamental and main reason was that after the leading cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant took over the factory in the past year, they subjectively failed to provide due care for these state properties and failed to make the greatest possible human effort to overcome the serious chaotic situation existing in the factory in a timely manner. This caused the waste to drag on for a long time. At the beginning of last year, the plant drafted a housing repair plan. In May, it drafted a materials sorting plan. However, the former included everything from the construction of factory buildings to the repair of dormitories, from the bricklaying of blast furnaces to the repair of plank boxes and toilets, without any justification or prioritization, causing the higher authorities to believe that it was a generally premature plan and not approve it. The "Materials Sorting Plan" was similar to the "Housing Repair Plan". All items related to materials sorting, such as drafting plans, revising systems, numbering codes, and defining names, were listed, but there was no emphasis on sorting the valuable equipment and machines abandoned in the plaza. Even according to this plan, it would not be possible to complete the sorting of the equipment in the plaza until the end of June this year. This kind of "plan" and approach that did not prioritize things was the result of not attaching importance to the valuable equipment abandoned in the plaza. Until August and September of last year, the plant's engineering department, which was directly responsible for materials sorting and storage, was still planning to "reprint the compilation of material names" and "adjust the names," in fact, keeping the materials sorting work stuck in the office drafting "plans" and "numbering codes" for a long time. Last summer, when the warehouse leaked, the plant again "sorted the materials inside the warehouse" without prioritizing things. In fact, many of the items in the warehouse were broken and worthless, while there was a large amount of valuable equipment and machinery in the open-air plaza. Last May, after a fire in the plant's laboratory, employees made many reasonable suggestions, including suggestions on how to quickly sort out the materials scattered everywhere, but these good opinions were not valued by the responsible cadres of the plant.

            Did Not Learn How to Manage the Enterprise
        Chaotic Production Organization and Financial System; Work Lacked Planning and Center
    Due to unclear production thinking, lack of production experience, and unwillingness to humbly learn from employees, the plant's production organization and financial systems were very chaotic. Work lacked planning and had no center. There were no or extremely incomplete cost accounting and budget systems, product specifications and inspection systems, and reward and punishment systems. This caused great damage to the plant in terms of production, equipment procurement, and finished product sales. For example, because there was no strictly responsible acceptance system when purchasing equipment, items worth more than 3,600 *jin* of rice were purchased from June to August last year but could not be used. Because of the lack of product specifications and inspection systems, rework, wasted labor, and material loss often occurred. Because there was no accurate cost accounting, maintenance costs unrelated to production were also included in the production costs, which increased the price of the products and made it difficult to sell them.

            Unclear "Production First" Thought
        Busy All Day But Not Busy in the "Right Way," Becoming "Hardworking Bureaucrats"
    The above shortcomings and errors are the result of serious wallowing in routine matters and bureaucracy. The plant's manager and military representative both used a "seal-stamping" secretary, but they still could not escape from the office, spending their days busy with meetings, instructions, and dealing with all the problems that came to them. They were very busy, but they were not busy in the "right way." As the plant pointed out when reviewing its own work: they became hardworking bureaucrats—in a word, the plant leadership, due to a lack of a clear "production first" thought, caused the entire plant's work to lose its direction. As a result of the entire plant losing its direction, there were many unprincipled phenomena. Disunity occurred between superiors and subordinates, between new and old cadres, between staff and workers, and between the Communist Party branch, the factory's administrative organization, and the trade union. There were even unprincipled personnel disputes. Without direction and without a leadership core, of course, a good factory could not be run.

            Superior Management Not Strict Enough, Education Not Enough, Further Encouraging the Blindness of the Plant
    Secondly, the North China Iron and Steel Company and the former North China People's Government Enterprise Department did not provide sufficient policy guidance to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which further increased the plant's blindness. The North China Iron and Steel Company's leadership of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant over the past year only played a liaison role in connecting the top and bottom. It rarely actively, earnestly, and deeply inspected, urged, and helped the plant's work. It did not provide strict criticism of the plant's serious waste of state property in a timely manner and did not try its best to help the plant improve this serious situation. Instead, it believed that this was an unavoidable phenomenon and pushed the responsibility to historical and objective reasons. This laissez-faire work attitude inevitably formed objectively an encouragement, encouragement, or at least tacit approval of the continued existence of this serious situation. The former North China People's Government Enterprise Department did not strictly manage the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, did not provide enough assistance and education, and its leadership of the plant remained in an extremely passive position. It rarely actively inspected work, assigned tasks, and specifically helped the plant solve difficulties. For example, the old enterprise structure, which seriously hindered the rapid development of the people's enterprise, was left intact for too long. The plant has been liberated for more than a year, but the cadres have not been determined. In a large factory with four or five thousand workers, only a few cadres have officially fixed positions, and the rest are temporarily acting. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is one of the important steel industrial centers in North China, but the former North China Enterprise Department did not seriously hold a special meeting during its term to study the policy issues related to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. These are all bureaucratic styles of wallowing in routine matters.

            After a Major Inspection Last Winter
    Security Measures for Machinery and Equipment Strengthened, Materials Classified, Inventoried, Concentrated, and Placed in Warehouses, Various Systems Began to Be Established
    After the Financial and Economic Committee sent personnel to inspect in August and September and the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government thoroughly inspected the plant in October, these serious phenomena attracted widespread attention from relevant parties. Under the direct leadership and specific assistance of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant conducted a strict self-criticism. In mid-November, the plant's administrative organization, Communist Party branch, and trade union jointly formed an inspection team and conducted an emergency major inspection of the entire plant. All affiliated factories universally cleaned machines and swept factory buildings. Since then, there has been great progress in the security measures for machinery and equipment, and phenomena that were previously commonplace but actually extremely dangerous have been corrected in a timely manner. It is particularly worth mentioning the work on materials sorting. As of the end of February this year, all materials have been basically sorted out. Important parts, machines, and various materials have been classified, concentrated, placed in warehouses, inventoried, and recorded. Some have been numbered according to category and cards have been made, and some have been wiped clean of dirt and rust, coated with oil for anti-corrosion. Heavy equipment that could not be stored in warehouses has also been concentrated according to category and padded with waste sleepers or covered with sheds for protection. According to statistics, more than 5,000 tons of machinery and equipment, more than 10 million various parts, and more than 3.5 million pieces of refractory bricks in more than 540 types have been rectified.

    In terms of the financial system, in addition to completing the settlement of old accounts for the entire year at the end of last year, a budget system, batch cost accounting, and cost accounting system, and a material reimbursement and inventory system have been established since this year. In terms of engineering, a regular inspection system for machine tools, an inspection and analysis system for raw materials entering the factory, and a product inspection system have also been established. In terms of factory management, various systems are also being established separately. First of all, starting from January this year, the past unreasonable "paid leave for personal affairs" (taking personal leave and still receiving wages) and other systems were abolished, and nine regulations such as "leave" and "rewards and punishments" have been drafted and are being submitted to higher authorities for instructions.

            Significant Progress in Production in January, but Great Fluctuations in February
        Still Need Hard Work in the Future
    These improvements have been reflected in production. In January, the plant's iron-smelting plant and coking plant exceeded their production plans and created new production records, which was the result of combining the enthusiasm of workers and the advanced technology of Soviet experts. However, the plant's overall production leadership work is still not done well enough and cannot fully guarantee the stable increase in production results. The plant's daily production records in February showed huge fluctuations. The iron-smelting plant, which exceeded its plan in January, not only failed to exceed its established plan in February, but also failed to complete the plan. As of February 23, the plant's cast iron pipe plant had only completed a little more than 68% of its original plan. This shows that the plant still needs to make hard efforts to move towards a stage of sound production.

　　石景山钢铁厂领导干部曾有事务主义官僚主义作风
    严重浪费国家资财  检查后已整顿纠正
    【本报特讯】记者田流报导：华北重要钢铁中心之一的石景山钢铁厂，经过去年秋冬间大检查后，严重浪费国家资财的现象业已停止，多年弃置的宝贵器材已分别整理，生产工作已开始有了起色。
            广场堆满贵重器材  任其风吹雨淋腐蚀
    石景山钢铁厂在检查前的情况是很严重的。那里，存在着严重的浪费国家资财的现象。例如在第二材料区三万六千方公尺的广场上，堆满了贵重器材、炼铁炉炉件、各种型钢和整箱的机器以及送风机、洋灰搅拌机和车床等，任其风吹雨淋腐蚀生锈。其中有一万一千八百方公尺面积的地面上的器材，竟尚未清点入账。即使在仓库里存放着的器材，也因库房败坏坍倒漏雨招致了巨大损失。国家资财的全部损失究竟到什么程度，因各种器材正在清点整理和检查，尚无法算出确实数字；但这种损失的异常严重和巨大是可以断定的。仅据有数可查的就有模型室损失模型百分之十五，其工料费一项就损失小米八千余斤；第一材料区损失各种油八千余立升，盐一万五千余斤。水电浪费更属骇人，去年八月该厂水的损失量即达全部引水量的百分之四十五。这些情况，已为去年九、十、十一三个月内政务院财经委员会、重工业部等机关对该厂多次的检查而得到了证实。
            遭受损失的主要原因
    该厂领导干部未给国家财产以应有的爱护，工作不分轻重缓急，只是坐在办公室里拟计划，而且未重视职工合理建议。
    石景山钢铁厂之所以发生如此严重的损失，固然有其历史遗留下来的严重混乱局面等客观原因，但基本的主要的原因却是石景山钢铁厂的领导干部在过去一年中接管了这个工厂之后，在主观方面，首先没有对这些国家财产给以应有的爱护，对于该厂存在的严重混乱现象没有尽人为的最大力量及时加以克服。这就使这种浪费现象长期地拖延下来。去年初，该厂解放后曾拟订了房屋修建计划；五月间，又拟过材料整理计划。但前者从建设厂房到修缮宿舍，从炼铁炉砌砖工程到修理铺板箱柜厕所等统统包括在内，没有说明理由，也未分出轻重缓急，致使上级以为是一般地过早提出的计划而未予批准。“整理材料计划”也和“房屋修建计划”相似，所有关于材料整理的项目如订计划、改制度、编号码、定名称……统统列上了，就是没有强调整理广场上弃置的贵重器材、机器等。即按照该项计划来做，也要到今年六月底才能将广场上的器材整理完毕。这种不分轻重缓急的“计划”和作法，是对弃置在广场上的贵重器材未加重视的结果，直到去年八、九月份，直接负责材料整理保管工作的该厂工务处，还在计划着“复印材料名称汇编”、“调整名称”等，事实上是将整理材料工作长期地停留在办公室里拟“计划”与“编号”上面。去年夏季仓库漏雨，该厂又不分轻重缓急地“整理仓库里面的材料”，其实仓库里不少是破烂不值钱的东西，而露天广场上却有大批贵重的器材和机器。去年五月，该厂化验室失火后，职工们曾提出很多合理建议，其中就有应如何迅速整理四散各处器材的建议，但这些很好的意见，并未被该厂负责干部所重视。
            没有学会管理企业
        生产组织财务制度混乱  工作缺乏计划没有中心
    由于生产思想不明确，又没有生产经验，且不肯虚心向职工学习，使该厂生产组织与财务制度等方面，都非常混乱。工作缺乏计划，没有中心，对于成本计算与预决算制度、产品规格与验工制度、奖惩制度等都没有或极不完备。这就使该厂在生产上、器材采购上及成品销售上均受到很大的损害。譬如因为采购器材时没有严格负责的验收制，去年六至八月份就有价值三千六百余斤米的物品买来而不能用。因为缺乏产品规格和验工制度，也常常发生返工、费工、损料的现象。因为没有精确的成本计算，将与生产无关的维护费也计算在生产成品中，提高了产品的价格，而造成产品推销的困难。
            “生产第一”思想不明确
        整天忙却没有忙在“门道”上成了“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者”
    上述缺点与错误的产生，是严重的事务主义与官僚主义的结果。该厂经理和军代表都用了一个“盖章”秘书，但他们仍不能从办公室脱出，整日忙着开会、批示、应付找上门来的一切问题。忙是很忙了，但没有忙在“门道”上。正像该厂检讨自己工作时指出的那样：成了辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者——一句话，该厂领导上由于缺乏“生产第一”的明确思想，便使得该厂全部工作迷失了方向。全厂失了方向的结果，无原则的现象就多起来了。上下级之间、新老干部之间、职员与工人之间，共产党支部、工厂行政组织与工会之间，都发生不团结的现象，甚至发生无原则的人事纠纷。既无方向，又无领导核心，当然办不出好工厂来。
            上级管理不严格教育不够  更加助长了该厂的盲目性
    其次，华北钢铁公司与前华北人民政府企业部对石景山钢铁厂的方针领导是很不够的，因而更增加了该厂的盲目性。华北钢铁公司一年来对石景山钢铁厂的领导，仅起了一种承上启下的连络作用，很少主动地、认真地、深入地去检查、督促和帮助该厂的工作。该厂存在着如此严重的浪费国家资财现象，也没有及时地给予严格的批评，并想尽一切办法帮助该厂改善这种严重情况；反而认为这是不可避免的现象，把责任推到历史的客观的原因上去。这种放任的工作态度，必然形成客观上助长、鼓励、最少是默许此种严重情况继续存在。前华北人民政府企业部对石景山钢铁厂管理不严格，帮助和教育不够，对该厂的领导停留在极其被动的地位，很少主动去检查工作、布置任务和具体帮助该厂解决困难。如对严重妨害人民企业迅速发展的旧企业机构原封不动地拖得太久；该厂解放经年，但干部尚未确定，拥有四、五千工人的大工厂，名正言顺固定职位的干部仅数人，其余都是临时暂代的。石景山钢铁厂为华北重要的钢铁工业中心之一，但前华北企业部期内，并未认真地举行专门会议，研究有关石景山钢铁厂的方针问题。这些都是事务主义和官僚主义的作风。
            去冬进行大检查后
    机器设备保安措施加强  器材分类清点集中入库  各种制度开始建立起来
    去年八、九月间，财委会派员检查及十月间中央人民政府重工业部对该厂彻底检查后，这些严重现象才引起有关方面的普遍注意。在重工业部直接领导与具体帮助下，石景山钢铁厂进行了严格的检讨。十一月中旬该厂行政组织、共产党支部及工会联合组成检查团，又进行了全厂紧急大检查，所属各厂普遍进行擦揩机器、清扫厂房。从此，对机器设备的保安措置上有了很大的进步，过去习以为常的而实极危险的现象也及时作了纠正。特别值得提出的是关于资材整理工作。截至今年二月底止，全部资材已基本上整理完毕，重要的机件、机器及各种器材已分类集中入库、清点入账，有的已按类编号制出卡片，有的已擦揩污锈涂油防腐，不能入库的笨重器材也按类集中起来，并用废枕木垫起，或上面搭起席棚保护起来。据统计已整顿的机器、器材达五千余吨，各种机件一千余万件，耐火砖五百四十余种三百五十余万块。
    在财务制度方面，除于去年底完成全年旧账结算外，并从今年起建立起预决算制度、分批成本会计和成本会计制度、材料报销盘存制度等。在工务方面也建立起机器工具的定期检查制度，原材料入厂检查分析化验制度、产品检查制度等。在工厂管理方面，各种制度也正分别建立，首先从今年一月起废除了过去不合理的“有资事假”（请事假还要拿工资）等制度，并草拟出“请假”“奖惩”等九种条例，正向上级请示中。
            一月份生产有显著进步  二月份却又有很大波动
        今后还须艰苦努力
    这些进步，已经反映到生产上面。一月份该厂所属炼铁厂、炼焦厂分别超过了生产计划和创造了生产新纪录，这是职工劳动积极性与苏联专家先进技术相结合的结果。但该厂全面的生产领导工作还作得不够，还不能完全保证生产成绩的稳定上涨。该厂二月份每天的生产纪录表现着巨大的波动。一月份曾经超过计划的炼铁厂，二月份不但超不过既定计划，且完不成计划。该厂的铸管厂至二月二十三日止，仅仅完成原计划百分之六十八多一点。这说明该厂还须作艰苦努力，才能走上健全生产的阶段。
