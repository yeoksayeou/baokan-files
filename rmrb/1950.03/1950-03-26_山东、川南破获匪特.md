Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Bandit and special agent organizations of the Kuomintang remnants have been successively cracked in Shandong, southern Sichuan, and other places. After a long period of investigation, the public security organs of Shandong Province cracked a special agent organization of the bandit "Ministry of National Defense, 11th Pacification District, Shandong Guerrilla Detachment Headquarters" in Qingdao, Jinan, Zibo, and other places from early January to the end of February. The main culprits, including pseudo-commander Liu Hongsheng, deputy commander Wu Hongwen, director of the political department Shi Chunxi, chief of general staff Jia Chunmao, and detachment leader Ma Xuewu, were captured. Two radio stations and electrical materials, intelligence documents, seals, commissions, weapons, and ammunition were seized. According to the confessions of Liu and others, this organization was directly arranged and appointed by bandit Liu Anqi, commander of the 11th Pacification Headquarters of the bandit Ministry of National Defense, before the Chiang bandit gang fled from Qingdao. The plan was to use scattered soldiers, vagrants, and former staff members as development targets in traffic lines and ports, mountainous areas. It was based on gangs, Taoist sects, and local bullies as its social base, to organize reactionary armed forces to carry out so-called "enemy rear guerrilla warfare" and various sabotage activities. After the liberation of Qingdao, Liu and others were distributed along the Jiaoji Railway to carry out activities, waiting for opportunities to sabotage transportation and mines; and secretly set up radio stations to report to the Taiwan remnants.

The public security organs in southern Sichuan also cracked the Chiang bandit "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army" special agent organization in Luxian County on the 19th and 20th of last month. The "First Route, Third General Detachment Commander" Zhang Weizhi, "Twelfth General Detachment Commander" Zhang Boqing, "Thirteenth General Detachment Deputy Commander" Liu Junru, and others of the organization were captured, and weapons, ammunition, and a telegram were seized. According to Zhang and others, this organization was formed by bandit Mao Renfeng, the person in charge of the pseudo "Ministry of National Defense Confidential Bureau," under the order of Chiang thief before he fled Chongqing, in an attempt to carry out the so-called "mainland guerrilla warfare" in the newly liberated areas of Southwest China.

In addition, the Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau recently arrested Li Gongfan, the Kuomintang special agent ringleader and "Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Anti-Communist National Salvation Army." Before Yu Chengwan and Li Mi's remnant bandit troops of the Kuomintang bandit army were completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in southern Yunnan, bandit Li was the primary element planned in advance to carry out so-called "guerrilla activities." After receiving the order, he sneaked into Chongqing from the Yunnan-Vietnam border, gathered bandits to carry out special agent activities, and was finally captured.

　　山东、川南破获匪特
    【新华社二十三日讯】山东、川南等地，相继破获国民党残匪特务组织。山东省公安机关经长期侦察后，于一月初至二月底在青岛、济南、淄博等地破获匪“国防部第十一绥区鲁游击支队司令总部”特务组织。捕获主犯伪司令刘洪生、副司令吴洪文、政治部主任史纯熙、总参谋长贾春茂及支队长马学武等。缴获电台两部及电器材料、情报、戳记、委任令、武器弹药等。据刘犯等供称：该组织系蒋匪帮自青岛逃窜前由匪国防部十一绥署司令刘安琪直接布置和委派的，计划在交通沿线及海口、山区地带，以散兵、游勇、旧职人员等为发展对象，以帮会、道门及恶霸分子等为其社会基础，组织反动武装，进行所谓“敌后游击”及各种破坏活动。刘犯等于青岛解放后，即分布于胶济铁路沿线一带进行活动，伺机破坏交通运输和矿山；并密设电台，与台湾残匪通报。
    川南公安机关亦于上月十九、二十两日在泸县破获蒋匪“忠义救国军”特务组织。捕获该组织“第一路第三总队司令”张微之、“十二总队司令”张伯卿、“十三总队副司令”刘俊儒等，并搜出武器、弹药及电报一部。据张匪等供称：该组织系蒋贼逃离重庆前命伪“国防部保密局”负责人毛匪人凤布署组成，企图在西南解放区进行所谓“大陆游击战争”。
    又重庆市公安局最近亦逮捕了国民党特务匪首“西南反共救国军总司令”李公藩。李匪是国民党匪军余程万、李弥残部在滇南被人民解放军全歼前所预为布置的阴谋进行所谓“游击活动”的首要分子。他奉命后由滇越边境潜来重庆，纠合匪徒进行特务活动，终于落网。
