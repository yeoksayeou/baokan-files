　　The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee
    Calls for a Spring Plowing Campaign
    Requiring Rural Branches to Guarantee 100% Implementation of the Provincial Government's Mobilization Order. Communist Party Members Should Become the Most Active Elements in Production.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily News: The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee issued a call on the 15th of this month regarding the launch of the spring plowing campaign, stating: "The Awakening of Insects has passed, and the Spring Equinox is approaching. Our province's spring plowing is about to begin in full swing. This is the most important key to completing our province's annual increase of three million shi of grain. Therefore, striving to complete spring plowing is the most important task for the rural party and all farmers at present. The Provincial People's Government has issued a spring plowing mobilization order to the entire province, and our party committees at all levels must immediately mobilize, mobilize all party members to lead the masses, and ensure the full implementation of this mobilization order."
    The Provincial Committee requires party committees at all levels to tightly grasp the central links of cultivating, harrowing, seed soaking, and seed selection, and the key points of supporting the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, workers, and the disabled, disaster victims, and newly liberated peasants, unify the thinking, steps, and strength of all departments of the Party, government, military, and people, and conduct timely major inspections and major assaults to create a vigorous spring plowing movement throughout the province.
    The Provincial Committee requires each rural branch to guarantee 100% implementation of the Provincial Government's mobilization order in your village; requires each party member to become the most active element in production and leading production, and at least lead three to five peasant households to organize, allocate labor to help each other, and carry out agricultural activities such as seed soaking, cultivating, harrowing, and pest control. It is also necessary to widely and deeply publicize the Party's policies, focusing on explaining to the masses that the People's Government guarantees all legitimate property rights and land rights, rewards hard work for prosperity, and will never increase the burden on the part produced by diligence. Special attention should be paid to exposing rumors at any time, dispelling all concerns, and creating a new atmosphere in rural areas of getting rich through hard work and boldly developing one's family!
    The Provincial Committee calls on all members of the Communist Youth League and labor heroes and models to continue to promote your exemplary leading role, mobilize all farmers, eliminate all concerns, work hard, and live a good life.
    The Provincial Committee calls on all male and female farmers to mobilize together, respond to the Provincial Government's mobilization order, complete the spring plowing task, and strive to increase the average grain production by eight shi per person for the whole year!

    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报消息：中共察哈尔省委于本月十五日，发出关于开展春耕运动的号召称：惊蛰已过，春分来临。我察省春耕即将全面展开。这是完成我省全年增产三百万市石粮食最重要的关键。因此，努力完成春耕，是目前农村党和全体农民最重要的任务。省人民政府已向全省发出了春耕动员令，我各级党委必须立即动员起来，发动全体党员带领群众，保证这一动员令的全部实现。
    省委要求各级党委，要紧紧的抓住耕地、耙地、浸种、调种等中心环节，和扶助烈、军、工属、灾民及新翻身农民的重点，统一党、政、军、民各部门的思想、步调和力量，进行适时的大检查和大突击，以造成全省轰轰烈烈的春耕运动。
    省委要求每个农村支部，要保证省府动员令在你村百分之百的实现；要求每个党员成为生产和领导生产中最积极的分子，至少需带动三、五户农民组织起来，拨工互助，进行浸种、耕地，耙地、除害虫等农业活动。并要广泛深入地宣传党的政策，着重向群众说明：人民政府保障一切合法的财权、地权，奖励劳动致富，因勤劳而增产的部分，绝不增加负担。特别要注意随时揭破谣言，解除一切顾虑，造成农村中劳动致富、放手发家的新气象！
    省委号召全体青年团员及劳动英雄模范，继续发扬你们的模范带头作用，把全体农民发动起来，去掉一切顾虑，努力劳动，过好光景。
    省委号召全体男、女农民一致动员起来，响应省政府的动员令，完成春耕任务，为全年每人平均增产八市斗粮食而奋斗！
