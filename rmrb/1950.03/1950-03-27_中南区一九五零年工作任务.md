Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Central South Military and Political Committee, based on Chairman Lin Biao's report, resolved to adopt the Central South Region's work tasks for 1950 (approved as amended by the 23rd Administrative Meeting of the Government Administration Council on March 10, 1950). The full text is as follows:

The first plenary session of the Central South Military and Political Committee listened to Chairman Lin Biao's report on the Central South Region's work tasks for 1950. After careful and detailed discussion, it unanimously agreed that this report fully complied with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the instructions of the Central People's Government, and the actual situation and needs of the region. The following resolution is hereby passed based on Chairman Lin's report:

  I.  Shifting the Focus of Work from Military Affairs to the Economy and Preparing for and Implementing Land Reform.

    A fundamental change has taken place in the situation in the Central South Region. Our focus of work has shifted from military affairs to the economy and the preparation for and implementation of land reform. This change is mainly due to the rapid victory of the Liberation War. The People's Liberation Army, entering the Central South Region, with the cooperation of the nationwide victory and the extremely enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people; under the direct and indirect uprising response of Generals Cheng Qian, Chen Mingren, Zhang Zhen, Tang Shengzhi, Wu Qiwai, and their units, as well as other democratic groups and revolutionary figures; especially under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, gave full play to the heroic and selfless fighting spirit. In less than six months of formal combat, the enemy's regular army of 600,000 and local armed forces of 500,000 (including teams, bandits, vagrants, constabulary, etc.) existing in the Central South mainland were completely eliminated and resolved by means of combat and peaceful means. Since then, all of the mainland territory of more than 1.14 million square kilometers has been liberated. The situation in the Central South has changed from a state of war to a state of peace. Our organization and work have shifted from dispersion to unity. This is a historic change. During this period, as mentioned in the report of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, we closely followed the development of the war and rapidly and orderly completed huge organizational tasks such as taking over cities, collecting grain for support, opening up the countryside, and communicating urban-rural relations, and achieved great achievements. In the cities, after eliminating the main enemies, industry and commerce have begun to recover. The working class and other people's masses have begun to consciously organize themselves around the production movement and participate in the national construction cause. In the vast rural areas of the six provinces in the region, campaigns to suppress bandits and oppose local bullies and reduce rent have been launched one after another, and the movement to pay public grain has been completed and is being completed. By the end of last December, the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan alone had annihilated 230,000 bandits and reorganized 150,000 vagrant armed forces. It is estimated that in areas with a population of more than 30 million, the rural government has been initially transformed due to the widespread democratic movement against local tyrants and evil gentry. People's representatives conferences and worker-peasant representative conferences have been held in urban and rural areas throughout the region, and a broad scale of unity among various democratic strata has been initially formed. All of these have created many favorable conditions for us to continue to move forward.

    On the other hand, however, a small number of remaining enemies are carrying out a dying struggle. The remaining bandits entrenched on Hainan Island are still trying to use imperialist forces to establish a lair there, preparing for the so-called "waiting for an opportunity to attack the mainland." In the newly liberated areas of western Hunan and the two Guangdongs, there are still nearly 150,000 bandit armed forces left behind by the enemy. Secret agents lurking in various places are still constantly carrying out sabotage activities. At the same time, the vast majority of the masses in the new areas have not yet been mobilized and organized, and the rural governments in the vast majority of areas have not yet been transformed. The wounds suffered by the urban and rural economy have not yet recovered. Approximately ten million people are affected by famine. There are financial difficulties and a shortage of cadres. These are all difficulties that must be overcome on our road to effort. Only by overcoming these difficulties can we lay a solid foundation for the six provinces of the Central South.

    In the coming year, there are many things we should do, but the most important ones should be: (1) eliminating the remaining enemies and consolidating national defense forces; (2) production and construction; (3) preparing for and implementing land reform; (4) rectifying finances and practicing thrift; (5) establishing a people's representative conference system, expanding unity and consolidating people's power; and (6) culture, education and cadre training. We must mobilize cadres and people throughout the region to victoriously complete these six specific tasks with the same spirit of hard struggle as in wartime.

  II. Eliminate the Remaining Enemies on Hainan Island, Eliminate Bandits, and Consolidate National Defense Forces.

    This year's military tasks first and foremost involve organizing the Hainan campaign to eliminate the remaining enemies on Hainan Island. Although the enemy is small in number and has lost its fighting spirit, because we are fighting across the sea, we will inevitably encounter certain difficulties, requiring full and thorough preparations in advance to achieve the glorious victory of the final battle.

    Secondly, we must quickly eliminate the bandit armed forces, striving to completely wipe out the remaining 150,000 bandits in the region within three to six months. Today's bandits are mostly composed of Kuomintang reactionaries and secret agents, and therefore are extremely reactionary politically. However, they have lost their support and fighting spirit. As long as the troops responsible for bandit suppression can cooperate with local authorities, unify plans, correctly implement the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service," and adopt a combination of military suppression and political offensives, combining flexible tactics with "troops working as work teams," helping local people solve their production and living difficulties, and mobilizing the masses to search for scattered bandits and crack down on bandits and local bullies, we can quickly eliminate the bandits.

    After the concentrated enemies are eliminated, scattered and hidden enemies still exist. The people throughout the region must be vigilant at all times and must combine with mass movements to organize mass armed security work (workers' pickets, militias, self-defense forces, etc.) and eliminate traitors in factories and rural areas. At the same time, the government's public security departments and judicial and procuratorial organs should be strengthened in order to give all counter-revolutionary elements the necessary blows and suppression in a timely and effective manner, ensuring the order of the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Although the war in the Central South region has basically ended victoriously, the field armies in the Central South region must still shoulder the glorious task entrusted by the Central People's Government and the Central Military Commission of defending the South China defense line. Therefore, the field armies in the Central South region must continue to improve and strengthen in terms of quality. In addition to a small number of field armies being transformed into local armies or public security forces to undertake local security tasks, the rest must be uniformly organized into national defense forces under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Central Military Commission. The entire army must take advantage of the post-war peaceful period to intensify training, learn modern combat experience, improve political and cultural levels, strengthen the new patriotic ideological education of all commanders and fighters, and conscientiously complete the training tasks assigned by the Military Commission. The army of the people's motherland is always a combat team, and it is extremely wrong to ignore or misunderstand this point. However, in 1950, in addition to the troops that still have to perform combat missions, other field armies and local armies must also take on the tasks of work teams and production teams according to different situations and conditions. They must strictly abide by Chairman Mao's and the Central Military Commission's instructions on troop production in 1950 and make significant achievements in order to reduce national financial expenditures, reduce the people's burden, and partially improve the living standards of the troops.

    The people and governments throughout the region must make the greatest efforts to help the construction of the national defense forces, carry forward the fine tradition of military-civilian cooperation in the past, cherish and respect soldiers, give preferential treatment to military families, resettle and care for honorary soldiers and families of martyrs, and improve the social status of the people's army in many ways, ensuring the continuous improvement of its combat effectiveness, in order to strengthen the forces defending the people's democratic dictatorship.

    In addition to the national defense forces, local armies, and public security forces, various localities must also systematically pay attention to and develop the people's armed forces that do not leave production, establish a militia system, establish leadership structures and work rules from top to bottom, and strengthen education and training in a planned manner, fostering their concept of loving the people's motherland and a new spirit of heroism, and taking on the task of protecting production and consolidating local security.

  III. Overcoming Various Difficulties to Carry Out Production and Construction.

    After we have won victory and peace, economic construction will become our most basic and long-term struggle task. At present, we must immediately start to heal the wounds of war, overcome various difficulties, and prepare to move towards the path of national industrialization step by step. The Central People's Government has formulated a portion of production and construction plans, ordering all parts of the country to earnestly implement them. In order to implement the central plan, the Central South Region must also have its own specific local plans suitable to local conditions. At present, we have many favorable conditions, such as winning peace, unity, and democracy, abundant material and human resources, a broad market, and the coordination of national production. These conditions will certainly play a permanent role. However, there are also many difficulties, such as the original production base being very weak and becoming even more dilapidated after being ravaged by the reactionary government for a long time, the rural productive forces not yet being liberated from the shackles of the feudal system, and the well-known financial straits. Although these difficulties can all be overcome, they can play a temporary role. Therefore, when we propose construction plans, we must take into account both future development and current difficulties. Only by being realistic and advancing step by step can we achieve good results. Here are just a few suggestions for reference when formulating plans:

    (1) This year's production and construction should mainly strive for recovery, while not giving up seeking partial development on the basis of recovery.

    (2) In restoring production, we must pay attention to restoring industry, but in industry, we must currently focus on light industry. The main projects should be: the textile industry, the oil pressing industry, the flour industry, the paper industry, the sugar industry, the cigarette industry, the ceramics industry, the leather industry, and other manufacturing industries related to these. According to the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, in addition to focusing on strengthening state-owned enterprises, we must also adequately and appropriately help private enterprises and develop necessary handicrafts. Heavy industry should adopt a focused recovery approach, first completing the steel and non-ferrous metal production plans required by the central government. Existing important state-owned factories should initially resume production on the existing basis, and coal mine production should be resumed conditionally. Necessary power equipment should be restored and newly built as needed. Based on the principle of "using light industry to support heavy industry," we should make light industry self-sufficient and profitable as much as possible, in order to accumulate capital and gradually develop heavy industry.

    (3) We must use our greatest strength to restore agriculture. The level of agricultural production has fallen by 30% compared to before the war, and we should strive to gradually restore it, at least maintaining the current level without further decline, as the overall goal. At the same time: (1) We should combine with special product procurement plans to increase the production of special crops such as cotton, tea, peanuts, tung oil, ramie, tobacco, sugarcane, and other side businesses such as animal husbandry, silk reeling, fishing, and salt production. (2) We should build water conservancy projects. We should immediately use the winter slack season to build ponds, dig canals, repair embankments, and dredge ditches according to local conditions to carry out flood prevention, drainage, and water storage projects. According to the plan of the Central Ministry of Water Resources, we should complete the 1950 Yangtze River water conservancy equipment on schedule. Special funds should be allocated in the local budget to promptly complete the supplementary water control plans of each province. (3) We should provide disaster relief to disaster areas, help local victims produce, overcome the spring famine, universally complete spring plowing and sowing, and eliminate uncultivated land.

    (4) In order to restore industry and agriculture, we must first immediately restore and develop transportation and commerce. We must accelerate the circulation of commodities and stabilize finance. Repair old ships and salvage sunken ships. Complete the highway construction designated by the central government. Complete the trade import and export plan. Complete the three tasks of public grain tax collection and public bonds. Encourage private investment in industry. Encourage factories to move inland. Develop cooperative undertakings with focus (especially urban consumer cooperatives and rural supply and marketing cooperatives), support legitimate commerce, and ban illegal business. Adjust industrial and commercial taxes.

    In order to achieve the above requirements, a series of effective measures must be taken. The more important aspects of these measures should be: paying attention to the leadership of urban work, strengthening work among workers, striving to organize the entire working class within one year, systematically carrying out worker education work, and gradually improving the wage system and welfare undertakings, so that their lives can be guaranteed, their political awareness can be gradually improved, and their enthusiasm can be fully demonstrated, in order to ensure the realization of the production plan. At the same time, we must pay attention to correctly handling labor-capital relations, overcome biases, and adopt methods such as stipulating collective contracts and arbitrating labor-capital disputes to achieve the goals of "both labor and capital benefiting" and "developing production." In terms of public economic management, we should emphasize the implementation of economic accounting, saving raw materials, improving production efficiency, and establishing a democratic management system under centralized leadership, uniting workers and technical talents, and achieving the four major goals of "large output, good quality, low cost, and wide sales" as instructed by Chairman Mao. In rural areas, work should be carried out in accordance with the principle stipulated in the Common Program that "land reform work in newly liberated areas should be combined with the restoration and development of agricultural production." From now on, during the transitional period of implementing anti-bullying and rent reduction, the following should be announced:

    (1) Landlords and rich peasants who rent out land should be allowed to collect rent according to law after implementing the "two-five rent reduction" according to law, and peasants should also pay rent according to the new rent rate after the rent reduction.

    (2) Freedom of employment is allowed, and wages are negotiated by both parties.

    (3) Freedom of lending is allowed, interest rates are negotiated by both parties, and loans should be repaid. When land reform is implemented, debt relations established after the establishment of the local people's government are not abolished.

    (4) Landlords are prohibited from selling and dispersing land on the pretext of land reform, and it is strictly forbidden to slaughter cattle, destroy production tools and houses, arbitrarily seize tenants, or abandon land. If they are unable to cultivate themselves, they should rent it to others to cultivate, ensuring that whoever cultivates it will harvest it. Encourage wasteland reclamation, and stipulate that newly reclaimed wasteland is exempt from burden for five years, and cultivated wasteland is exempt from burden for three years.

    (5) Labor income should be protected. If land ownership is transferred due to the implementation of land reform after the land is sown, the original tenant's right to benefit from the current season should remain unchanged, and distribution should be carried out as much as possible according to the original cultivation, and more should be taken from the rich and less from the poor.

    (6) Agricultural tax should be paid according to the reasonable burden system. If there are unreasonable phenomena in the burden, such as being too light or too heavy, extra levies, concealing black land, or shifting the burden, they can report the facts to the local government and request adjustment and handling.

    The implementation of these regulations aims to appropriately stabilize rural production relations, so that all strata can concentrate on production without violating the farming season. Spring plowing is coming soon, so we must immediately start and lead the masses to carry out preparatory work, laying a foundation for this year's agricultural harvest. A good harvest this autumn will greatly increase our strength to overcome difficulties. We must strive to achieve it. However, there is an unavoidable difficulty in this year's spring plowing, which is the famine phenomenon in some areas. Local governments must organize the production self-rescue work of the disaster-stricken areas in a timely and effective manner. On the one hand, they should organize the masses to crack down on bandits and special agents who take the opportunity to make trouble and disrupt production, and ensure the people's production order. On the other hand, they should vigorously combine water conservancy and transportation construction with the transportation of grain and mountain goods, implement work-for-relief, launch social mutual assistance, promote social frugality, and issue spring plowing loans to help the victims overcome the spring famine, complete spring plowing, and strive to achieve the requirements of not starving people to death and not abandoning land.

  IV. Preparing for and Implementing Land Reform, Consolidating the Worker-Peasant Alliance.

    In 1950, the rural social reform movement centered on preparing for and implementing land reform will become the most enormous and arduous task on our entire work agenda. Only by completing this step well and as quickly as possible can we create the necessary conditions for developing productive forces and national industrialization, and can we further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance. The Common Program stipulates that "in areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, the peasant masses must be mobilized to establish peasant organizations, and to realize the principle of 'land to the tiller' through steps such as clearing out bandits and bullies, reducing rent and interest, and distributing land." In accordance with this provision and the specific conditions of the Central South Region, the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong should begin preparing now, striving to start distributing land in the winter of this year and the spring of next year, and complete it within the next year, but only implement "two-five rent reduction" before the autumn of 1950, without distributing land. Henan has been preparing for more than a year and can start distributing land this spring, striving to complete it before the spring plowing of next year. Guangxi and other parts of other provinces should first eliminate banditry, continue to reduce rent and oppose local bullies, and decide on the time to implement land distribution after the autumn harvest of 1951, depending on the development of the work.

    Land reform is the second major struggle of the people's democratic revolution. Without full preparation, the expected victory cannot be achieved. This year, in addition to areas where land distribution has already begun, other areas should regard preparing for land reform as a central task that runs through all periods and tasks throughout the year. The bandit suppression, anti-bullying, rent reduction, and production movements carried out in different areas and at different times should all revolve around this requirement, gradually and systematically mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses, and after suffering and "tracing the roots of poverty," organizing peasant self-education movements, improving peasant awareness, expanding peasant organizations, and establishing a strong peasant revolutionary force, preparing the necessary mass foundation for land reform. It is necessary to convene people's representatives conferences and district and township peasant representatives conferences universally, abolish the baojia system and establish rural democratic governments, unite the majority of the people, and establish a strong political guarantee for land reform. It is necessary to cultivate a large number of peasant leaders in a planned manner, promote local cadres, and train old cadres, new cadres, and township cadres once to several times in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, helping them learn policies, familiarize themselves with the new environment and new working methods, and correct their erroneous views and methods, in order to strengthen and improve the leadership of the peasant movement. After this meeting, each province should formulate its own practical implementation plans and specific schedules for the above tasks, effectively concentrate forces, and complete each item on schedule. The time for land distribution cannot be delayed any further, so preparation work must be stepped up.

    The enemy's reactionary rule has been overthrown, the revolutionary cause has achieved victory throughout the country, and the people throughout the country have their common regulations – the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Major and favorable changes have taken place in rural class relations. Under this new situation, we should require land reform work to be carried out faster and better, and make the whole process smoother. As long as the policies are clear and the methods are appropriate, we can greatly reduce many obstacles and difficulties and shorten the working process under the general principle of relying on the poor peasants, uniting the middle peasants and all other anti-feudal elements, eliminating the feudal exploitation system in a differentiated and step-by-step manner, and developing agricultural production, strictly distinguishing between the enemy, ourselves, and our friends, treating all kinds of enemies differently, and using legal means to fight. Therefore, we should formulate our land reform methods according to the following principles:

    (1) The entire economic interests of the middle peasants (including the well-to-do middle peasants) must never be infringed upon when distributing land and other means of production.

    (2) resolutely protect industry and commerce, and do not infringe upon the industry and commerce run by landlords for any reason.

    (3) Intellectuals, freelancers, and other democratic people should be won over, united, and helped to progress, and strive to make them stand on the side of the peasants.

    (4) After the landlord's land property is confiscated, everyone should be left with the same share of land and means of production as the peasants, and labor reform should be implemented to make them engage in production; the practice of "kicking them out of the house" and "chasing after the land wealth" should be prohibited.

    (5) Saboteurs should be handed over to the government for punishment according to law, and lawless and resistant elements among the landlords should be cracked down on; but it is strictly forbidden to beat and kill people indiscriminately, and welcome should be expressed to enlightened people who automatically take the lead in advocating and implementing laws and regulations.

    (6) We must pay attention to protecting production, encourage production, prohibit any destructive acts against production, and immediately use all conditions to support the production of poor peasants.

    (7) Specific issues that should be paid special attention to in the southern provinces, such as handling overseas Chinese land, ethnic minority land, tea mountains, bamboo mountains, tung oil mountains, fir mountains, fish ponds, sand fields, salt fields, forests, orchards, water conservancy facilities, etc., should be studied and properly regulated as soon as possible.

    (8) The peasants' association, that is, the people's congress or representative conference of peasants at all levels and the committees elected by them, should become the legal enforcement agencies for reforming the land system. The peasants' association should abide by and implement government laws and regulations, promote democracy, organize and lead the peasant masses to carry out anti-feudal struggles, and complete land reform in a step-by-step manner.

    Carrying out work according to these policy principles can form a rural anti-feudal united front, minimize all kinds of obstruction and sabotage, and make the peasant's land reform movement develop in a led and orderly manner. However, it must also be understood that land reform is a revolutionary cause that changes the historical system, and after all, it will encounter all kinds of resistance. Without the enthusiastic revolutionary actions of millions of people, it is impossible to imagine the so-called smooth completion. The principles we have put forward are to give the masses action pointers, so that the masses can give full play to their own strength and smoothly complete this revolutionary task. It is not to limit the mass movement and reduce the scale of the mass movement. The People's Government and the Peasants' Association must mobilize the masses in accordance with the above principles, and cannot replace mass actions with simple administrative orders, let alone use various excuses to cancel mass revolutionary actions. We must oppose wrong policies and oppose the state of anarchy and indiscipline, but we must also implement correct policies and give full play to the masses' initiative and enthusiasm. Only through the congress or peasant representative conference, leading the masses, uniting themselves, consciously implementing the correct policies, using democratic and legal means, carrying out anti-feudal struggles in the political, economic, and ideological aspects, and defeating all kinds of resistance from feudal forces, can the peasant class complete its historical task of "seeking liberation by itself" under the guarantee of the people's democratic dictatorship. We must both smoothly and as quickly as possible realize land to the tiller, in order to develop production and construction; and we must also, through this historical reform, guide the peasant masses to further awaken and organize themselves, so that they become a powerful political force in the revolutionary alliance of the people's democratic dictatorship, and participate in the various construction undertakings of the new China in an organized manner. This is a complete and indivisible requirement of our work in rural areas today. If there is any deviation, our revolutionary cause will inevitably suffer losses, so we must pay attention to preventing it.

  V. Rectifying Finances, Practicing Thrift.

    This year, one of the difficulties that needs to be overcome with the greatest effort is financial difficulty. Last year was also difficult, but with the support of the people throughout the region who cherished the country and actively contributed, and the military and government personnel who cherished the people's strength and saved money, the difficulty was overcome. This year, it still needs to be overcome in the same way.

    From the regional financial budget presented at this meeting, it can be understood that it is formulated in accordance with the national financial plan and the regional situation. Its basic spirit is also a combination of living within one's means and matching income with expenditure, tightening expenditures as much as possible to minimize the increase in the people's burden, and at the same time extracting money from the difficulties for construction. Therefore, this revenue and expenditure plan must be completed, and the three tasks of public grain tax collection and public bonds must be organized with great effort, otherwise it will cause new difficulties.

    It should be explained to all sectors of the people that the burden imposed on the people by the state cannot be said to be light under today's conditions, but it also cannot be said to be too heavy because it has not exceeded the people's ability to bear it. When collecting public grain in the previous year, there were voices from some people in the countryside calling it heavy. As a result of sending people to check, the central problem was discovered. It was not a universal problem of being heavy, but a problem of being too light or too heavy, with light and heavy burdens in all strata. Although this is unavoidable under our current working conditions, it is also not good. In the future, whether in urban or rural areas, the burden method should be improved. The government should start researching and formulating a more reasonable tax rate based on the principle of reasonable burden. When the people know the meaning of the government's burden of "taking from the people and using it for the people," and can promote democracy and have a fair method, they can be happy to contribute and be brave to contribute.

    Practicing thrift is another important aspect of ensuring the revenue and expenditure plan. The financial expenditure policy today is: any item that is not included in the plan, and can be stopped or postponed, must be resolutely stopped or postponed. The effective way to use money in finance is to use it in a focused and planned manner. Trying to do everything at once will accomplish nothing. Secondly, it is necessary to emphasize financial unity. Unity can save money, because business plans are unified and the economy is unified. Doing things separately will inevitably increase new difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a unified system, reorganize institutions, verify the number of people, and unify revenue and expenditure to ensure the realization of the financial plan. Finally, the largest expenditure in the budget is the supply of military and government personnel. Therefore, if military and government personnel can strive to save a part, and can find ways to produce and be self-sufficient in a part, it will save the country and the people a large amount of money for construction undertakings. 1.5 million PLA soldiers have formulated a plan that, depending on the tasks and conditions of the garrison, each person should produce 150 to 1,000 catties of grain to solve a part of their own supply. They should be encouraged to persist in realizing this. Local personnel should also find more ways to carry out amateur production under possible conditions. This year, everyone must endure difficulties, maintain our tradition of hard struggle, be meticulous in planning, live frugally, and resolutely stop the style of corruption and waste. Under today's circumstances, corruption and waste are crimes, they are enemies of the people, and in addition to being subject to disciplinary sanctions, the broad masses must be educated, and the concept of cherishing the property of the people's motherland must be improved, creating a spiritual resistance to corruption and waste, so that those who hold wrong ideas can correct them as soon as possible. At the same time, concrete measures must be taken to prevent the loss and destruction of state property. In particular, it is necessary to prevent the loss and damage of public grain.

  VI. Establishing a System of People's Representative Conferences, Expanding Unity, and Consolidating People's Power.

    In order to implement various production and construction undertakings and social reform work, it is necessary to establish a system of people's representative conferences at all levels, expand unity, and consolidate people's power.

    In 1950, it is necessary to universally convene people's representatives conferences in provinces, cities, and counties, and peasant representatives conferences in districts and townships, and fix them as a system to be implemented on time, in order to expand the mass base of the people's democratic power and strengthen the unity between various revolutionary strata. Within the three months of this spring, all counties and cities that have not convened people's representatives conferences must convene one, and places that have already convened one must convene another one. In the next year, provincial levels must convene one to two times, and each county and city must convene one approximately every three months; district and township levels must conscientiously and universally convene peasant representatives conferences, abolish the baojia system at the right time, and elect rural people's governments through peasant representatives conferences. The powers at the provincial, city, and county levels must all elect and consult the Consultative Committee through the people's representative conference in a prepared manner, and when conditions permit, exercise the powers of the People's Congress, implement elections, and establish a local joint government. At the same time, it is also necessary to earnestly carry out the adjustment of cadres, establish systems, improve working methods, and gradually improve the power structure, so as to concentrate revolutionary forces to carry out local economic and cultural construction and social reform work, and consolidate the gains already achieved.

    Secondly, in this year, the majority of the people, especially the basic masses such as workers, peasants, and other laborers, women, and youth, must be organized. Trade unions, peasant associations, and youth and women's organizations must be improved and expanded. The government must do its best to help and support various people's organizations in terms of politics and improving working conditions. It should also learn to rely on the masses to implement policies and laws.

    The establishment of the Military and Political Committee shows that the people's democratic united front in the Central South Region has been further formed organizationally. The task in the future should be to further strengthen unity and expand unity. For this purpose, it is necessary to effectively help all members participating in the united front to accelerate their own progress, always be vigilant against all the enemy's conspiracies to sow discord, and increase the degree of close cooperation with each other. When jointly discussing and handling various matters, an open and honest attitude should be adopted, even if this may cause some differences and disputes. As long as these differences and disputes are for solving the principled issues related to the current interests of the people, rather than for trivial non-principled issues, then it will be beneficial and harmless.

    In the Central South Region, there are ethnic minorities such as Hui, Yi, Miao, Yao, Zhuang, and Li. During the Liberation War, they stood with the People's Liberation Army and enthusiastically fought against the Chiang bandit army. We must strengthen the principle of national mutual assistance in accordance with the Common Program, unite them, educate them, and train a large number of their cadres in accordance with their special living conditions and customs. Then, according to their degree of awareness and organization, we will help them gradually implement social reform and construction work, so as to change from the oppressed and backward state of the past into a progressive nation. In addition to ethnic minorities, there are also nearly ten million overseas Chinese, who are also an important force in building the motherland. Various methods must be taken to further unite and organize them to participate in the construction of the motherland in various ways.

    Unity must be strengthened between the upper and lower levels of governments at all levels. Local governments at all levels must strictly abide by the unified systems, laws, regulations, and construction plans of the central government and higher-level governments. If there are different opinions, suggestions can be put forward, but they cannot be modified or abolished without authorization. Therefore, the system of requesting instructions and reporting must be strictly implemented to enhance contact and ensure unity. At the same time, higher-level governments should pay attention to promoting democracy, listen to the useful opinions of lower-level governments, take care of their practical difficulties, and solve the problems they request instructions on in a timely manner, in order to continuously improve leadership, strengthen unity, and establish the necessary conditions for unified concentration. In terms of responsibilities, it is necessary to clarify the division of labor. As far as our Central South Region is concerned, matters that are suitable for centralized handling should be handled by the Military and Political Committee; matters that are suitable for local handling, the Military and Political Committee can make principled decisions and hand them over to local handling to give play to local initiative.

    In addition, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, we must also pay attention to establishing close contact and cooperation with all friendly neighboring regions, pay more attention to learning from their experience in construction and reform work, and strive to support each other in economic, political, and military aspects, in order to complete all the tasks given by the Central People's Government.

  VII. Developing Culture and Education, Training Cadres.

    In 1950, existing schools must be maintained and restored as much as possible, and the old education system should be reformed in a prepared and step-by-step manner in accordance with the Ministry of Education's plan. At the same time, two or three worker-peasant middle schools should be established as new educational experimental schools to create experience and set examples. The training and transformation of existing teachers and the training of new teachers must also be strengthened to meet the needs. Private middle schools should be rectified in accordance with the Ministry of Education's policy.

    After freeing themselves from the long-term and heavy oppression and exploitation of the reactionary rule, the masses of the people in the Central South Region will gradually increase their cultural demands with the development of economic construction and social reform movements. Therefore, a national, scientific, and mass cultural and educational popularization movement should be launched in a prepared manner, so that the broad masses can be liberated from the ideological influence of the reactionary classes and further establish new ideas and new morals of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property. For this purpose, spare time schools for workers, staff, youth, and women should be established, old dramas should be transformed, new dramas should be promoted, literary and artistic creation should be encouraged, and the news, publishing, and broadcasting industries should be strengthened. Academic research should be encouraged, and scientific centers, museums, and libraries should be restored and maintained in a planned manner, and revolutionary literature and other historical documents should be collected in a timely manner. Closely combined with the rural social reform movement, mass ideological enlightenment movements should be carried out, winter schools should be held in the winter slack season, and literacy education should be promoted. All opportunities should be used to educate people of all strata in urban and rural areas throughout the region on land reform and production construction, mobilizing the masses to recognize the current difficulties, overcome the difficulties, and complete the tasks. Cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union should be organized, the Soviet Union's construction experience should be introduced, and efforts should be made to consolidate and develop the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, strengthen internationalist education, and expand cooperation between the peoples of all nations in the world. In addition, attention should also be paid to promoting public health education and national sports, promoting the development of health construction undertakings, preparing the necessary medical personnel and equipment, effectively preventing and eradicating epidemics, and improving people's health.

    At present, all provinces feel that there are too few cadres and their quality is not high, which is one of the major difficulties in all work, and it must be seriously resolved. In this regard, the first thing to focus on is to train and promote a large number of new cadres. This year, each province (city) should train and promote a sufficient number of worker-peasant cadres through cadre training classes, people's representative conferences, and various mass

　　中南区一九五零年工作任务
    【新华社二十六日讯】中南军政委员会根据林彪主席的报告，决议通过之中南区一九五○年的工作任务，（一九五○年三月十日政务院第二十三次政务会议修改批准）全文如下：
    中南军政委员会首次全体会议，听取了林彪主席关于中南区一九五○年工作任务报告，并经过慎重细密的讨论之后，一致认为这一报告，完全符合于人民政协共同纲领与中央人民政府指示，以及本区实际情况与需要。兹根据林主席报告通过如下决议：
  一  工作重心，由军事方面转到经济方面和准备与实行土改。
    中南区形势已经发生了一个根本的变化。我们的工作重心，已由军事方面转到经济方面和准备与实行土地改革方面了。这个变化主要是由解放战争的迅速胜利所引起的，进入中南区的人民解放军，在全国胜利形势的配合，与广大人民极其热情的支援之下；在程潜、陈明仁、张轸、唐生智、吴奇伟等将军与其所部，以及其他民主团体、革命人士直接间接起义响应之下；特别是在毛主席的英明领导之下，高度发挥了英勇忘我的战斗精神。正式作战时间还不到六个月，就将存在于中南大陆的敌人正规军六十万，地方武装五十万（包括团队土匪游杂宪兵等），以战斗方式与和平方式全部消灭解决。从此，一百一十四万多平方公里的全部大陆国土，获得解放了。中南形势，已由战争状态变为和平状态了。我们的组织和工作，已由分散走向统一了。这是一个历史性的大变化。在此时期内，即如中原临时人民政府报告中所讲到的，我们紧随着战争的发展，曾迅速而有秩序地完成了接管城市、征粮支前、开辟乡村、沟通城乡关系等巨大的组织工作，并取得巨大成就。在城市，把主要敌人消灭之后，工商业已开始恢复，工人阶级及其他人民群众，已经围绕生产运动开始自觉地组织起来，参与了国家的建设事业。在全区六省广大乡村，均先后发起了剿匪反霸及减租运动，并完成了和正在完成着缴纳公粮运动。至去年十二月止，只豫、鄂、赣、湘四省即已歼灭土匪二十三万，收编游杂武装十五万。约计三千万人口以上地区，由于普遍开展了反对豪强恶霸的民主运动，大部初步改造了乡村政权。全区各城乡都先后召开了各界人民代表会议，工人农民代表会议，各民主阶层之间一个广大的团结规模已经初步形成。所有这些，都为我们继续前进创造了许多有利条件。
    但在另一方面，少数残余敌人正在进行垂死的挣扎。盘据在海南岛的残匪，还企图借帝国主义势力，在那里建立巢穴，准备所谓“待机向大陆进攻”。在湘西、两广这些新解放区，还有敌人遗留的近十五万土匪武装，潜伏于各地的特务分子，还在不断进行破坏活动，同时广大新区的绝大多数群众尚未发动组织起来，绝大部分地区的乡村政权还未获得改造。城乡经济所受的创伤还未恢复。约有千万人口地区又发生灾荒。财政困难、干部缺乏。这些都是在我们努力的道路上必须克服的困难，只有克服了这些困难，才能打下中南六省巩固的基础。
    在今后一年内我们应做的事情是很多的，但其中最主要的应该是：（一）肃清残敌，巩固国防力量；（二）生产建设；（三）准备与实行土地改革；（四）整顿财政，厉行节约；（五）建立人民代表会议制度，扩大团结巩固人民政权；（六）文化教育与培养干部等六项具体任务，必须动员全区干部和人民，拿出像战争时期一样艰苦斗争精神去胜利完成它。
  二  消灭海南岛残敌，消灭土匪，巩固国防力量。
    今年在军事方面的任务，首先就是组织海南作战，消灭海南岛上的残余敌人。敌人虽已为数不多，斗志丧失，但因为我们是渡海作战，还不免遭受一定的困难，需要事前有充分周密的准备，来取得最后一战的光荣胜利。
    其次，就是迅速消灭土匪武装，须争取在三个月至半年时间内将全区残存的十五万土匪完全肃清。今天的土匪，大部是国民党反动分子特务分子主持组成的，因而政治上是极其反动的，但他们已失却凭依，丧失斗志，只要我们担负剿匪任务的部队，能协同地方，统一计划，正确执行“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策，采取军事清剿与政治攻势相结合，灵活的战术与“部队工作队化”相结合的方法，帮助当地群众，解决其生产与生活困难，发动群众搜剿散匪打击通匪恶霸，即能将土匪迅速肃清。
    集中的敌人消灭之后，分散的隐蔽的敌人还是存在的，全区人民，必须随时提高警惕，并须结合群众运动，在工厂中农村中，组织群众性的武装保卫工作（工人纠察队、民兵、自卫队之类）和除奸工作，同时应强化政府公安部门与司法检察机关，以便及时而有效地给一切反革命分子以应有的打击和镇压，确保人民民主专政的秩序。
    战争在中南地区虽已基本上胜利结束，但中南地区的野战军，还要担负中央人民政府及中央军委所赋予的保卫华南国防线的光荣任务，因此，中南地区的野战军，须从质量上继续提高与加强，除少数野战军将转化而为地方军或公安部队担负地方治安任务外，其余都要统一编制为中央人民政府中央军委领导下的国防军，全军必须乘战后和平时期，加紧整训，学习现代作战经验，提高政治文化水平，加强全体指战员新的爱国主义思想教育，切实完成军委所赋予的整训任务。人民祖国的军队永远是一个战斗队，忽视或误解这一点是万分错误的。但是在一九五○年，除开尚须担负作战任务的部队外，其他不论野战军、地方军，还要根据不同情况不同条件，兼负工作队、生产队的任务，严格遵照毛主席及中央军委一九五○年部队生产指示，做出显著的成绩，以减少国家财政开支，减轻人民负担，部分地改善部队生活。
    全区人民与政府必须尽最大努力，帮助国防军的建设，发扬过去军民合作的优良传统，爱护与尊重军人，优待军属，安置抚恤荣誉军人与烈属，从多方面提高人民军队的社会地位，保障其战斗力的不断提高，以加强捍卫人民民主专政的力量。
    除国防军、地方军、公安部队之外，各地还要随着群众运动及土地改革的开展，系统地注意与发展不脱离生产的人民武装，建立民兵制度，自上而下地确立领导建制，工作章则，有计划地加强教育训练，发扬其爱护人民祖国的观念和新的英雄主义精神，担负保卫生产、巩固地方治安的任务。
  三  克服各种困难进行生产建设
    在我们赢得胜利与和平之后，经济建设工作，即将成为我们最基本的与长期的斗争任务。在现时，我们就必须立即动手医治战争创伤，克服各种困难，准备一步一步地向着国家工业化的道路前进。中央人民政府已订妥一部分生产建设计划，责令全国各地切实执行。中南区为执行中央总计划，还须有它自己具体的适合本地情况的地方性计划，现时我们已具备着许多有利条件，如赢得和平统一与民主，如物力人力的雄厚，有广大的市场，有全国生产的配合等，这些条件一定会起其永久性的作用；但同时也有许多困难，如原有生产基础甚为薄弱，在反动政府长期摧残后益显残破，如农村生产力尚未从封建制度的束缚下获得解放，如人人所知的财政支绌情形，这些困难虽都是可以克服的，但却能起其暂时性的作用；因此，我们在提出建设计划时，既须照顾将来发展，又须照顾现在困难，唯有实事求是，逐步前进，才能取得良好效果。这里只提出以下几点意见，用作制订计划时的参考：
    （一）今年的生产建设，主要要求应该是争取恢复，同时不放弃在恢复的基础上求部分发展。
    （二）在恢复生产中须注意恢复工业，但在工业中，目前又须着重轻工业，其主要项目应该是：纺织业、榨油业、面粉业、造纸业、制糖业、纸烟业、陶瓷业、皮革业以及与此有关联的其他制造业。按公私兼顾原则，除必须着重加强公营企业外，还须足够而适当地帮助私人企业，并发展必要的手工业。重工业则应采取有重点的恢复方针，首先完成中央所要求的钢铁与有色金属生产计划，现有重要国营工厂应在现有基础上初步恢复生产，有条件地恢复煤矿生产。依据需要恢复与新建必要的动力设备。本“以轻养重”原则，尽可能使轻工业保本自给并获得利润，以积累资本，逐渐发展重工业。
    （三）必须用最大力量去恢复农业，农业生产水平比战前下降百分之三十，应争取其逐步恢复，至少要维持现有水平不再下降，作为总的目标。同时：（１）应结合特产收购计划，增产特种作物如棉花、茶叶、花生、桐油、苎麻、烟叶、甘蔗及其他副业如牧畜、缫丝、渔盐等项。（２）应兴修水利。即时利用冬闲，因地制宜开塘掘渠，修堤疏沟，进行防水、排水、蓄水工程。按中央水利部计划，如期完成一九五○年度的长江水利设备。地方预算中应筹拨专款，及时完成各省治水补充计划。（３）应救济灾区，帮助当地灾民生产，渡过春荒，普遍完成春耕播种，消灭熟荒。
    （四）为恢复工业与农业，必须先即时恢复与发展交通运输和商业。须加速商品流转，稳定金融。修理旧船，打捞沉船。完成中央指定的公路修建。完成贸易出入口计划。完成公粮税收公债三项任务。奖励私人投资工业。奖励内迁工厂。有重点的发展合作事业（特别是城市消费合作社与乡村的供销合作社），扶植正当商业，取缔非法营业。调整工商税收。（⑴⑵）
    为实现上述要求，必须采取一系列的有效办法，这些办法，比较重要的几个方面，应该是：重视对城市工作的领导，加强在工人中的工作，争取于一年内把全部工人阶级组织起来，有系统地进行工人教育工作，逐步改良工资制度与福利事业，使他们的生活能获得保障，政治觉悟能逐步提高，高度发挥其积极性，以保证生产计划的实现。同时必须注意正确的处理劳资关系，克服偏向，采用订定集体合同仲裁劳资争议等办法，实现“劳资两利”“发展生产”的目的。在公营经济管理方面，应强调实行经济核算，节约原料，提高生产效率，建立集中领导下的民主管理制度，团结工人与技术人才，做到毛主席所指示的“产量大，质量好，成本低，销路广”四大目标。在农村方面应依照共同纲领规定“在新解放区土地改革工作均应与恢复和发展农业生产相结合”的方针去进行工作。从现时起，在实行反霸减租的过渡时期，即应宣布：
    （１）出租土地的地主富农，在依法实行二五减租之后，应允许其依法收租，农民也应于减租后依新租率交租。
    （２）允许雇佣自由，工资由双方自议。
    （３）允许借贷自由，利率由双方自议，并应有借有还。在实行土改时，凡当地人民政府建立后的债务关系，不在废除之列。
    （４）禁止地主借故变卖与分散土地，并严禁其宰杀耕牛，破坏生产工具及房舍，不得无故夺佃，不得荒芜土地。自己无力耕种时，应租让他人耕种，保证谁种谁收。奖励开荒，并规定生荒在五年，熟荒在三年内免除负担。
    （５）保护劳动所得，田地下种后，如因实行土改，土地所有权有所转移时，原耕户本季收益权仍应维持不变，并应尽可能按原耕实行分配，并实行抽多补少，抽肥补瘦。
    （６）农业税按合理负担制度实行缴纳。负担中有畸轻畸重，额外派款，隐瞒黑地，转嫁负担等不合理现象时，得据实向当地政府申诉，请求调整处理。
    实行这些规定，以求适当稳定农村生产关系，使各阶层均能安心生产，不违农时。春耕即将到来，必须立即动手，领导群众进行准备工作，为今年农产品的收获打下一个基础。今秋能有一个好收成，就会大大增加我们克服困难的力量。必须努力争取。但在今年春耕中却有一个不容忽视的困难，这就是部分地区的灾荒现象。各地政府必须及时而有效地组织被灾区的生产自救工作。一方面要组织群众，打击乘机作乱破坏生产的土匪特务分子，保证人民的生产秩序，一方面应大力结合水利交通建设，与粮食山货之运输，实行以工代赈，发动社会互济，提倡社会节约，并发放春耕贷款，帮助灾民渡过春荒，完成春耕，争取实现不饿死人，不荒芜土地的要求。
  四  准备与实行土地改革，巩固工农联盟。
    在一九五○年，以准备和实行土地改革为中心的农村社会改革运动，将成为我们全部工作日程中最巨大而又最繁重的任务。只有很好而又尽可能迅速地走完这一步骤，才能为发展生产力与国家工业化创造必要的条件，才能使人民民主专政在工农联盟的基础上更加巩固起来。共同纲领规定“凡尚未实行土地改革的地区必须发动农民群众，建立农民团体，经过清除土匪恶霸，减租减息和分配土地等项步骤，实现耕者有其田”。依照这一规定及中南区具体条件，湘、鄂、赣、粤四省即应于现在开始准备，争取于今冬明春开始实行分配土地，于明年一年内完成，但在一九五○年秋季以前只实行“二五减租”，不分配土地。河南已经过一年多准备工作，即可于今春开始分配土地，争取于明年春耕以前完成。广西及其他各省部分地区，则应先肃清匪患，继续减租反霸，依工作发展情况，在一九五一年秋收以后，再行决定实行分配土地的时间。
    土地改革乃是人民民主革命的第二场严重斗争。没有充分的准备，是不能获得预期胜利的。在今年除业已开始分配土地的地区外，其他各地皆应将准备土地改革作为贯穿全年各时期与各项工作的一个中心任务。在不同地区不同时间所进行的剿匪反霸减租生产运动，都应围绕这个要求，逐步而有系统地发动群众，组织群众与武装群众，经过诉苦、“追穷根”，组织农民自我教育运动，提高农民觉悟，扩大农民组织，建立一个强大的农民革命队伍，为土地改革准备必要的群众基础。必须普遍地召开各界人民代表会议，和区乡农民代表会议，废除保甲制度建立乡村民主政权，团结大多数人民，为土地改革建立有力的政治保障。必须有计划地培养大批农民领袖，提拔本地干部，并于春夏秋三季分别将老干部、新干部及乡干部，普遍训练一次至数次，帮助他们学习政策，熟悉新的环境和新的工作方法，纠正其错误观点和错误方法，以加强与提高对农民运动的领导力量。在此次会议后，各省皆应就上述各项任务，订出自己切实的实施计划与具体日程，有效的集中力量，逐项如期完成。分配土地的时间，已不容再事推迟，因此，准备工作就必须加紧进行。
    敌人反动统治业已推翻，革命事业业已在全国取得胜利，全国人民业已有了他们的共同法规——人民政协共同纲领。乡村阶级关系业已发生了重大的有利变化，在这种新情况下，我们应要求土地改革工作，进行的更快些更好些，使其整个过程更加顺利些。只要政策明确，方法适当，在依靠贫农，团结中农及其他一切反封建分子，有区别地有步骤地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产这个总原则下，严格分清敌我友界线，有区别地对待各种敌人，采取合法的方式进行斗争，必能大大减少许多阻力与困难，而使工作过程缩短。因此应根据下列一些原则来制订我们土地改革的办法：
    （一）在分配土地及其他生产资料时，中农（包括富裕中农在内）全部经济利益绝不能侵犯。
    （二）坚决保护工商业，不得以任何借口，侵犯地主兼营的工商业。
    （三）知识分子，自由职业者，其他民主人士，应本争取和团结帮助其进步的方针，争取他们与农民站在一边。
    （四）地主土地财产没收之后，应给每人留下与农民同样一份土地和生产资料，并实行劳动改造，使其从事生产；“扫地出门”与“追地财”的作法应予禁止。
    （五）破坏分子应交政府依法惩处，地主中违法顽抗的分子应予打击；但必须严禁乱打乱杀，而对于自动以身作则倡导执行法令的开明人士，则当表示欢迎。
    （六）必须注意保护生产，奖励生产，禁止对生产的任何破坏行为，并应即时利用一切条件支持贫农生产。
    （七）在江南各省所应特殊注意的具体问题如处理华侨土地、少数民族土地、茶山、竹山、桐山、杉山、鱼塘、沙田、盐埕、森林、果园、水利设备等等皆应早作研究，妥善加以规定。
    （八）农民协会，即各级农民代表大会或代表会议及其所选出的委员会，应成为改革土地制度的合法执行机关，农民协会应遵守与执行政府法令，发扬民主，组织与领导农民群众进行反封建斗争，有步骤地完成土地改革。
    根据这些政策原则去进行工作，就可以结成农村反封建统一战线，将各种阻挠与破坏减少至最低限度，而使农民的土地改革运动有领导有秩序地开展起来。不过，还须了解：土地改革乃是一个改变历史制度的革命事业，毕竟要遭遇到种种的抵抗，没有千万群众热烈的革命行动，所谓顺利完成，是无法想像的。我们所提的这些原则，是为了给群众以行动指针，便于群众发扬自己的力量，去顺利完成这一革命任务。而不是为了限制群众运动，减弱群众运动规模。人民政府及农民协会必须按照上述原则去发动群众，而不能用单纯行政命令去代替群众行动，更不能采取各种借口，取消群众革命行动。我们必须反对错误的政策，反对无政府无纪律状态，但又必须执行正确政策充分发挥群众的自动性与积极性。只有经过代表大会或农民代表会议，领导群众，团结自己，自觉地执行正确政策，运用民主合法方式，开展政治、经济、思想各方面的反封建斗争，战胜封建势力的各种抵抗，才能使农民阶级，在人民民主专政制度的保障底下，完成其“自求解放”的历史任务。我们既须要顺利而又尽可能迅速地实现耕者有其田，以发展生产建设；又须要经过这一历史改革，引导农民群众进一步觉悟起来与组织起来，使他们成为人民民主专政的革命联盟中一个强大的政治力量，有组织地参加新中国的各项建设事业。这就是我们今天在农村工作中一个完整而不可分割的要求。假如有所偏废，将不免使我们的革命事业遭受损失，故须注意防止。
  五  整顿财政，厉行节约。
    在今年，需用最大力量努力克服的一个困难，就是财政困难。去年同样也是困难，但在全区人民爱护国家踊跃输将，军政人员爱惜民力省吃俭用的支持之下，困难渡过去了，今年还需要同样渡过它。
    从提出于此次会议的本区财政概算书可以了解，它是依据全国财政计划及本区情况订定的，它的基本精神也是量入为出与量出为入相结合，一面紧缩开支，尽可能少增加人民的负担，一面又要从困难中抽出钱来进行建设，因此这个收支计划，是不能不完成的，公粮税收公债三项任务是必须用大力组织进行的，否则将引起新的困难。
    应向各界人民说明，国家所加在人民身上的负担，按今天条件讲不能说轻，但因其并未曾超过人民的负担能力，也不能说太重。在上年度征收公粮时，曾引起乡村中若干人士叫重的呼声，派人检查的结果，发现了中心问题，不是普遍的重，而是畸轻畸重，各阶层中都是有轻有重，这在我们当前工作条件下，虽然是难免的，但也是不好的。今后不论城市与乡村，都要把负担办法加以改善，政府应依据合理负担原则，开始研究订定一个比较合理的税率。当人民知道了政府负担“取之于民用之于民”的意义，又能发扬民主，有一个公道的办法，就可以做到乐于出而又勇于出了。
    厉行节约，是保证收支计划的另一个重要方面。今天的财政开支方针，是：凡不订入计划的，能不办或缓办的就坚决不办或缓办。财政上有效的用钱方法，就是有重点的有计划的使用，百废俱举就会一事无成。其次，必须强调财政统一，统一才能节约，因为事业计划是统一的，经济是统一的，各自为政必增加新的困难，因此必须统一确立制度，整编机构，核实人数，统一收支，保证财政计划的实现。最后，预算中最大的开支是军政人员的供给，因此，军政人员能努力节省一部分，能想办法生产自给一部分，就会给国家人民省出一大批钱来用于建设事业。一百五十万解放军已订出计划，根据任务与驻地的不同条件，每人要生产一百五十斤至一千斤粮食，解决自己一部供给，应该鼓励他们坚持实现。地方人员也应多想办法在可能条件下进行业余生产。在今年，大家都必须忍受困难，保持我们艰苦斗争的传统，精打细算，节衣缩食，坚决制止贪污浪费作风。在今天情况下贪污浪费就是犯罪，就是人民的敌人，除必须予以纪律制裁外，还须教育广大群众，提高爱护人民祖国财产的观念，造成对贪污浪费分子的精神抵制，使那些抱有错误想法的人们及早改正。与此同时，又须采取具体措施，防止国家财产的损耗与破坏。尤其要防止公粮的损失毁坏。
  六  建立人民代表会议制度，扩大团结，巩固人民政权。
    为实行各项生产建设事业与社会改革工作，必须建立各级人民代表会议制度，扩大团结，巩固人民政权。
    在一九五○年，必须普遍地召开省市县的各界人民代表会议和区乡农民代表会议，并固定成为按时执行的制度，以扩大人民民主政权的群众基础，加强各个革命阶层间的团结。今春三个月内，凡未开各界人民代表会议的各县市，必须召开一次，已开过的地方须再开一次。今后一年内省级须开一次至两次，各县各市每三个月左右召开一次；区乡两级则须认真普遍地召开农民代表会议，适时废除保甲制度，由农民代表会议选举乡村人民政府。省、市、县各级政权，均须有准备地经过人民代表会议，选举协商委员会，并于条件允许时，执行人民代表大会职权，实行选举，建立地方性的联合政府。同时还须认真进行调整干部，确立制度，改进工作方法，把政权机构逐步健全起来，借以集中革命力量开展当地经济文化建设与社会改革工作，巩固既得胜利。
    其次，在今年一年内，必须把人民群众的大多数，尤其是工人、农民及其他劳动者与妇女青年等基本群众组织起来。必须健全与扩大工会，农民协会，及青年妇女团体。政府对于各种人民团体，必须在政治方面、改善工作条件方面，尽力予以帮助支持。并应学会依靠群众贯彻执行政策法令。
    军政委员会的成立，说明在中南区人民民主统一战线已在组织上进一步形成，今后的任务，应该是进一步加强团结与扩大团结。为此目的，必须有效地帮助一切参加统一战线的成员，加速自己的进步，随时警惕敌人一切挑拨离间的阴谋，增进相互密切合作的程度。在共同协商与办理各种事情时，应该采取开诚布公坦白直陈的态度，即使因此而可能产生一些分歧与争论，只要这些分歧与争论是为了解决与当前人民利益有关的原则问题，而不是为了无关紧要的非原则问题，则将是有益无害的。
    在中南区，有回、彝、苗、徭、僮、黎等少数民族，他们在解放战争中，曾和人民解放军站在一道，热情地进行了对蒋匪军的斗争。我们必须依据共同纲领中加强民族互助原则，依据他们特殊的生活条件风俗习惯，团结他们，教育他们，大批训练他们的干部，然后依照他们的觉悟与组织程度，帮助他们逐步实行社会改革与建设工作，以便从过去那种受压迫的落后的状态中改变成为一个进步民族。除少数民族外，还有近千万的华侨，同样是建设祖国事业中的一个重要力量，也须采取各种办法进一步团结与组织他们用各种方法参加祖国建设。
    在各级政府上下之间必须加强统一团结。各级地方政府必须严格遵守中央政府与上级政府的统一的制度法令与建设计划。有不同意见可以提出建议，而不可擅自修改或废置不行。因此应严格执行请示报告制度，增强联系，保证统一。同时上级政府应注意发扬民主，听取下级有益的意见，照顾其实际困难，及时解决其所请示的问题，以期不断改进领导，加强团结，建立统一集中的必要条件。在职责上需要明确分工，就我中南区内部讲，宜于集中办的事项，即应由军政委员会办理；宜于归各地办理的事项，军政委员会即可做出原则决定，交地方办理，以发挥地方积极性。
    此外，在中央人民政府统一领导下，我们还必须注意与一切友邻区取得密切的联系与配合，多注意学习他们建设与改革工作的经验，在经济、政治、军事各方面努力相互支援，以期完成中央人民政府所给予的一切任务。
  七  开展文化教育，培养干部。
    在一九五○年内，必须尽可能将现有学校维持与恢复起来，并应遵照教育部计划，着手将旧的教育制度有准备有步骤地加以改革，同时举办两三个工农中学作为新教育实验性学校，以创造经验，树立楷模。还须加强原有教员的训练改造与新教员的培养，以应需要。对私立中学，则应按教育部方针加以整顿。
    中南地区人民大众，于摆脱反动统治长期惨重的压迫剥削之后，随着经济建设与社会改革运动的发展，其文化要求，必将逐渐高涨起来。因此应有准备地开展一个民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育普及运动，使广大群众能从反动阶级的思想影响下解放出来，进一步树立爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的新思想新道德。为此目的，应开办职工、青年、妇女业余学校，改造旧剧，推广新剧，奖励文艺创作，加强新闻出版广播事业。奖励学术研究，有计划的恢复与维持科学馆、博物馆、图书馆，及时收集革命文献及其他历史文献。密切结合乡村社会改革运动，开展群众思想启蒙运动，利用冬闲举办冬学，推行识字教育。利用一切机会向全区城乡各阶层人民进行土地改革与生产建设的教育，动员群众认识当前困难，并克服困难，完成任务。组织中苏文化交流，介绍苏联建设经验，努力巩固与发展中苏人民之间的友谊团结，加强国际主义教育，扩大全世界各民族人民之间的合作。此外还须注意提倡公共卫生教育与国民体育，推广卫生建设事业，准备必要的医务人才与医药器材，有效地防止瘟疫，扑灭瘟疫，增进人民健康。
    目前各省均感干部数量太少，质量不高，这是全部工作中重大困难之一，必须认真加以解决。在这方面，首先要着重努力实现的是培养提拔大批新干部。各省（市）在今年应经过干部训练班、人民代表会议及各种群众组织，训练提拔足够数量的工农干部，参加国家的管理与建设事业。与此同时仍应继续过去吸收与培养青年知识分子、技术人材、专门人材的方针。现有短期革命大学及其他大学，应注意培养专才，以应今后大生产运动的急需。对已接收的旧军政人员，则应按毛主席和中央政府的指示全部包养下来，认真加以训练改造，争取其中的大多数成为人民的干部。老干部及其他的在职干部，则应注意组织他们进行学习，进一步提高其水平，除有计划的抽调轮训外，还要确立一个经常的在职干部学习制度。举办机关学校、业余补习学校，实行学习奖励，建立考核制度。文化水准较高的着重理论、政策与业务学习；文化水平低的则还应着重文化学习。以老干部带头示范，组织所有在职干部展开一个学习运动，使干部水平普遍提高一步，我们的工作也就会完成得更其顺利些。
      八
    一九四九年，我们曾在军事战线上取得胜利。一九五○年我们必将在建设与社会改革战线上取得新的胜利。虽然摆在我们面前的任务还是极其繁重的，前进途中的困难依然是很多的，但由于我们有毛主席与中央人民政府的正确领导，有各民主阶层之间的良好团结，还有其他许多比过去任何时期都为有利的条件，只要我们能谨慎艰苦地进行各种工作，将全区一万万以上勇敢而又勤劳的人民大众组织起来，将他们伟大的创造力充分发挥出来，这些困难将会一一克服，中央人民政府所给予的各种任务将会胜利完成并努力超过，这是可以完全肯定的。让我们依照我们既定的胜利日程开始前进吧！
