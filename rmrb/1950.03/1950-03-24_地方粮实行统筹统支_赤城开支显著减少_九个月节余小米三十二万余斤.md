　　Local Grain Implements Unified Management of Revenue and Expenditure
    Chicheng's Expenditures Significantly Reduced
    Surplus of Over 320,000 Jin of Millet in Nine Months
    Adhering to the System of Timely Grain Storage Based on Vouchers to Open Up Cadres' Thinking
    Implementing Frugal Practices for District and Village Office Supplies
    Unified Issuance of Supplies in Kind
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to the Chahar Daily News on March 21st: After Chicheng County implemented unified management of revenue and expenditure for local grain, from April to December of last year, the county's expenditure surplus was 323,944 jin of millet, accounting for slightly less than 36% of the original budget of 900,000 jin. The village expenses of the county's 276 administrative villages had a surplus of 19,253 jin of millet, accounting for 33.5% of the original budget. At the beginning of the unified management of revenue and expenditure for local grain in the county, cadres and the masses had resistance. The masses feared the difficulty of paying at once and feared that after paying at once, they would still have piecemeal burdens. Cadres feared being constrained by the strict system. Based on this situation, the county leadership conducted policy education on unified management of village funds among county, district, and village cadres and the masses, implementing the financial policy of "centralized unity" and the idea of long-term construction. At the same time, ideological education against village localism was carried out among village cadres and the masses, and it was emphasized that after the implementation of unified management, no extra levies were allowed. The masses not only had the right to refuse to pay but also had the right to report and supervise. At the same time, the actual benefits of unified management were explained, and a relatively sound budget and final accounting system was established. For all operating expenses and temporary expenditures, the competent departments adhered to the budget system. Temporary necessary expenditures in districts and villages also adhered to the system of prior budget application and approval. The phenomenon of "reporting after acting" was basically eliminated.
    Each district adhered to the monthly report system to the county, so the county could grasp more accurate revenue and expenditure figures. In addition, a relatively strict grain depot system was established. Local grain depots in each district adhered to the system of timely grain storage and allocation based on vouchers, preventing excess spending, misappropriation, and unnecessary expenditures, and further eliminating corruption and waste. Therefore, the expenditures in all aspects were reduced. Unified management of village funds started in April. Before implementation, two things were done: Education on frugal calculation was conducted for village cadres to overcome the wrong idea of "not feeling sorry for spending public money." A thorough review of the old financial revenue and expenditure of each village was carried out. The county's nine months of experience proved that this was the foundation for the unified management of village funds. If the old financial revenue and expenditure cannot be cleared up, the masses will be dissatisfied, and it will leave an excuse for destroying the new system, which will affect the persistence and consolidation of the unified management system. At the beginning, village funds were issued in rice, but the results of the April experiment showed that many problems occurred due to the different conditions of cadres in each district. Some districts only focused on adhering to reimbursement procedures and did not pay attention to reviewing the standards of actual expenditures and the prices of goods. For example, Dushikou District insisted that villages report office expenses and original receipts every month, otherwise, they would not be given grain. As a result, some village cadres said they would not spend money because they had little education and could not prepare budgets and final accounts. Some villages could not receive things in time, and some things had to be spent, so they incurred debts and borrowed. These villages suffered losses after exchanging rice for money due to rising prices. For example, Yunzhou Village spent 17.5 jin of millet to buy 28 sheets of hemp paper in April, but at market prices, 17.5 jin of millet could buy 60 sheets. Individual villages spent freely and took the opportunity to report more. For example, Yousuobao Village bought three brushes in April. In response to the above situation, the county conducted special research and decided to change from issuing rice to issuing supplies in kind in May. The specific method was as follows: Village expenses were uniformly controlled by the county and received and distributed by the district on behalf of the county. Hemp paper, brushes, ink, etc., under the village office expenses, were uniformly purchased by the county finance department and distributed in kind according to the size of the village. Newspapers were also subscribed to by the county uniformly. In this way, each village no longer needed to prepare a budget, reducing many administrative procedures. At the same time, due to centralized purchasing, prices were also cheaper. As for all temporary necessary expenditures in the village, it was necessary to adhere to the system of prior budget application and post-event final accounting with a list of items attached. In the implementation process, certain improvements were made based on the opinions of each village. For example, it was still inconvenient to issue rice for lamp oil expenses in small villages in the mountains, so it was later changed to issuing oil, and necessary adjustments were made according to the complexity of the work and the amount needed in each village. After this method was implemented, the burden on the masses was reduced compared to before, and they became more supportive and trusting of the government. Many people said, "You really know how to manage!"

### 地方粮实行统筹统支  赤城开支显著减少  九个月节余小米三十二万余斤

　　地方粮实行统筹统支
    赤城开支显著减少
    九个月节余小米三十二万余斤
    坚持按时入库凭条拨粮制度打通干部思想
    实行精打细算区村办公用具
    统一核发实物
    【本报讯】据三月二十一日察哈尔日报消息：赤城县地方粮统筹统支后，自去年四月至十二月，全县开支节余小米三十二万三千九百四十四斤，占原预算九十万斤的百分之三十六弱。全县二百七十六个行政村的村经费，即节余小米一万九千二百五十三斤，占原预算的百分之三十三点五。该县在地方粮统筹统支工作开始，干部群众都有抵抗情绪，群众怕一次缴困难，怕一次缴了还要零碎负担；干部则怕制度严格了受蹩。该县领导方面根据这一情况，对县、区、村干部与群众中进行了村款统筹统支的政策教育，贯彻“集中统一”的财政方针和长期建设思想。同时在村干部与群众中，进行反对村本位等思想教育，并强调提出：实行统筹后，不许另有摊派，群众不但有权拒纳，而且有权检举和监督。同时说明统筹的实际好处，建立了比较健全的预决算制度。凡属事业费及临时开支，各主管部门均坚持了预算制度，区、村临时必要开支，也都坚持了事先预算请示批准制度。“先斩后奏”的现象基本上肃清了。
    各区对县均坚持了月报制度，因此县里能掌握住较准确的收支数字。另外，还建立了比较严格的粮库制度：各区地方粮库，均坚持了按时入库及凭条拨粮的制度，防止了浮支、挪用及不必要的开支，更杜绝了贪污浪费。因此，使各方面的开支都缩小了。村款统筹是从四月份开始的。在未实行前先作了两件事情：对村干部进行精打细算的教育，克服了“花公家钱不心疼”的错误思想。对各村旧的财政收支进行了彻底清理。该县九个月的经验证明，这是村款统筹统支工作的基础。旧财政收支清理不了，不但群众不满，而且也给破坏新制度留下了借口，就会影响统筹制度的坚持与巩固。村款开始是发米，但四月份实验结果，由于各区干部条件不同，曾发生了不少问题。有的区只着重坚持报销手续，不注意审查实物开支标准及物品价额。如独石口区硬叫村里每月报办公费计算和原始单据，否则就不发给粮食。因此有些村干部由于文化程度低，不会造预决算就说我们不花了。有些村由于不能及时领到东西，而村里有些又是非花不可的，就发生了赊欠与挪借。这些村领米变钱后，由于物价上涨而吃亏。如云州村四月份买麻纸二十八张，就用了小米十七斤半，但按市价有十七斤半小米就能买六十张。个别村放手开支，趁机多报。如右所堡村四月份即买毛笔三支。针对上述情况，县里又专门进行了研究，确定从五月份将发米改为发实物。具体办法如下：村经费由县统一掌握，由区代领转发。村办公费项下之麻纸、笔墨等，由县财政科统一购买，按村大小统一发实物。报纸也由县统一代订。这样各村即不再造预算，减少了许多事务手续。同时，由于集中购买，物价也较便宜。至于村中一切临时必要开支，则必须坚持事先预算请示、事后造决算连清单一起报账的制度。在实行中又根据各村意见作了某些改进，如灯油费发米，山沟小村仍觉不便，后来改成发油，根据各村工作的繁简，需用的多少，又进行了必要的调剂。这个办法实行后，群众负担较前减轻，对政府就更加拥护与信任，许多人都说：“你们真会过日子！”。
