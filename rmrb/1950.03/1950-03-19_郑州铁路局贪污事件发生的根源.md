Root Causes of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Embezzlement Incident
By Our Reporter Chen Ji

Last November, a major embezzlement case occurred at the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. In the project of building sixteen water towers for the bureau, some former employees colluded with contractors to arbitrarily raise the bid prices, causing the bureau to lose more than 8 million jin of the people's wheat. This reporter went to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to understand the reasons for this incident and found that the bureau had many undesirable and bad ideological work styles.

Pei Baoren, the chief of the construction section of the engineering division of the Zhengzhou Bureau, who was directly responsible for reviewing this project, was originally a former employee who fled to Hangzhou before liberation and was sent back from Hangzhou. He was a very unprincipled person. When he was responsible for reviewing the bid prices, he colluded with the contractors and engaged in fraud. He deliberately pretended not to know about the obvious questions in the contracting. After the incident was discovered, he defended the contractors everywhere, saying that prices were high at the time and the price of steel bars was too high. In fact, the steel bars were purchased by the bureau itself and were not included in the contracting. The contractor's bid price, excluding the steel bar item, was still 969,200 jin of wheat per water tower, which was 68% higher than the original estimate. Although prices were high at that time, and the price of materials was higher than that of wheat, it could not be 68% higher. At the same time, in the contract signed between the bureau and the contractor, it was stipulated that the scaffolding and formwork used in the project should be handed over to the contractor. In fact, these two materials were purchased by the bureau with 7,211,200 jin of wheat; after use, they should have belonged to the bureau. However, Pei Baoren, who reviewed the bid prices, simply gave them to the contractors for free. The responsible personnel of the Zhengzhou Bureau did not pay attention to the review beforehand, nor did they check and discover afterwards this kind of lawless and criminal behavior of defrauding the people's railway property. After the bid was determined and before the contract price was decided, the chief of the engineering division of the bureau simply put a stamp on the budget sheet and forwarded it to the director. The director did not study it either, and approved it with a stamp as usual. The contracting project for sixteen water towers was decided in such a muddled way. Before the contractors sought this lucrative business opportunity, several contractors in Shanghai bought a large amount of steel bars, raised the price of steel bars, and manipulated the market, causing the price of steel bars to rise sharply. Fortunately, our construction workers in Shanghai wrote to the Central Financial and Economic Commission, reporting this situation. In early January of this year, under the instruction of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, the Ministry of Railways supervised and urged the Zhengzhou Bureau to investigate this matter. Only then did the Zhengzhou Bureau begin to pay attention, conduct inspections, discover the above situation, and immediately start handling it.

Why did such a serious incident occur? The person in charge of the engineering division of the bureau said: "At that time, the Ministry of Railways allocated 18.4 billion yuan, and prices fluctuated several times a day. We were afraid that the currency would depreciate, so we all wanted to spend the money as soon as possible." With this mentality, when contracting this project, they hurriedly paid 50% of the construction funds to the contractors; they only thought that the currency would depreciate, but did not review the bid prices of the cunning contractors. They never calculated the accounts carefully. For example, the bid price of the water tower stipulated that the unit price per cubic meter of foundation earthwork was 95 jin of wheat; but after accurate calculation, at most 15 jin would be enough. 80 jin of wheat were over-calculated per cubic meter of earth, and with 800 cubic meters of earth per water tower, a total of 1,024,000 jin of wheat were over-calculated for sixteen water towers. Another example: the bid price for the machine parts and fuel consumption of the foundation pile was completely unreasonable. Since the contractor listed the labor cost of driving piles, it was obviously driven by manual labor. Then, in manual pile driving, where did the cost of machine parts and fuel consumption come from? The bureau did not discover this muddled account, so it was impossible to find out the malpractice.

This bureaucratic work style of not understanding the situation below and not studying the actual situation is widespread in the entire Zhengzhou Bureau. Therefore, in terms of engineering construction, it manifested itself in serious shortcomings and a chaotic situation of disorganization and lack of planning, and corrupt elements and speculative merchants were able to take advantage of the situation. For example, in the plan to build sixteen water towers, it was originally planned to build a water tower in Dangshan; but according to later understanding, Dangshan already had a 100-ton brick base water tower that could still be used. As a result, work was temporarily suspended after the contract was awarded. Another example: two locomotive depots were built simultaneously in the Zhengzhou area last year, one built by the railway bureau and the other built by the locomotive department (only one was enough), and the location selection was extremely inappropriate, which was the biggest waste. Examples of such corruption and waste are countless in the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. It is a common and serious problem, not only in the engineering department, but also in other departments. In the past, several cases of corruption and waste existing within the scope of the bureau were exposed, but they were not thoroughly and clearly given the due punishment, so that evil practices prevailed, causing serious losses to state property.

In the past year, the bureau has done a lot of work, such as rushing to repair railway lines, supporting the million-strong army going south, large-scale repair of railway lines, tidying up Zhengzhou Station, clearing blockages, and the gradual progress of transportation efficiency, all of which have achieved good results. However, because the leadership style has improved very little, these achievements cannot be consolidated and continued in depth. The chief of the engineering division of the bureau said that they are busy with instructions and reports all day long, grabbing a handful of this and touching a bit of that, dealing with this pile and another pile comes, taking care of the near and losing the far, taking care of this and losing that, taking care of the top and losing the bottom, sometimes busy until one, two, or three in the morning, or even all night, and still not getting anything done. They are all dragged down by various trivial matters. In the specific work leadership of the Zhengzhou Bureau, there has been a phenomenon of no one being responsible for a long time. The old bureaucratic style of "approved", "obey", and "follow" permeated from top to bottom, the work was chaotic and disorganized, without a plan, without a center, without steps, not reporting the situation to the top, and not solving problems for the bottom. In this way, before the rainy season last year, they could not grasp the central link of road maintenance work. As a result, when the rainy season came, accidents occurred frequently on the Jinghan and Longhai lines, resulting in serious blockages.

Due to the prevalence of bureaucracy, the bureau's affiliated institutions lacked political atmosphere, righteousness could not be promoted, evil prevailed, and the work of the institutions was lax and slack. To this day, there are still intolerable phenomena such as teasing female employees in the office and keeping old opera troupes (singing poisonous old operas) all year round. The person in charge of the bureau turned a blind eye to these phenomena. The education of former employees is also extremely inadequate. The Zhengzhou Bureau has been established for two years, and some employees still have an attitude of perfunctoriness and neglect of duty. They engage in factionalism, open strife and veiled struggle, and arrange for personal affairs. Some backward elements, seeing active employees working enthusiastically, even sarcastically say: "No matter how hard you work, you are just a 'slave'; we are like this, and in a few years, we will still be 'talents'." These backward elements adopt a two-faced attitude of "showing off on all sides, hiding from the top and not hiding from the bottom" towards the cause of people's railway construction. They neither seek progress nor work hard. They are very conservative in technical business and extremely resistant to new things. And the person in charge of the Zhengzhou Bureau lacks serious education and transformation work for these backward personnel and their ideological work styles. A few corrupt and backward elements, seeing an opportunity, unscrupulously committed evil. Therefore, the occurrence of the water tower incident was by no means accidental.

　　郑州铁路局贪污事件发生的根源
    本报记者  陈迹
    去年十一月，郑州铁路管理局发生了一个重大的贪污案件。在该局修建十六座水塔的工程中，由于某些旧职员和包商勾结任意抬高标价，致使路局损失人民的小麦八百多万斤。记者曾至郑州铁路局了解这一事件的发生原因，发现了路局方面存在着许多不应有的恶劣的思想作风。
    直接审查这项工程的郑州局工务处工事股股长裴保仁，本来是在解放前逃往杭州，从杭州被遣送回来的旧职员，为人极不正派。他负责审查标价时，与包商勾搭，通同作弊，对于包工中极其明显的疑问，故意装作不知道。事件发现以后，他还处处替包商辩护，说什么当时物价高涨，钢筋价格太高。其实钢筋是由路局自己购买的，没有列在包修中。包商的标价除去钢筋一项，每座水塔尚要小麦九十六万九千二百斤，竟比原来概算超出百分之六十八。虽然当时物价高涨，材料比小麦的价钱为高，但是总不能高出百分之六十八。同时在路局和包商签定的合同里，规定工程所用的脚手板和模型板交给包商。事实上，此两项材料本是路局以七百二十一万一千二百斤小麦购制的；用完以后，理应归路局所有。但是审查标价的裴保仁却偏偏把它们白送给包商。对于这种无法无天骗取人民铁道财产的罪恶行为，郑州局负责人员事先既未注意审核，事后也未检查发现。当投标确定以后和决定包价以前，该局工务处处长只是在预算表上盖一手章，就转呈给局长。而局长也没研究，照例盖章批准。十六座水塔包修工程，就这样糊糊涂涂地作了决定。在包商谋取这笔发财生意以前，有几家包商在上海大买钢筋，抬高钢筋价格，操纵市场，钢筋价格骤然猛涨。幸而我们上海的建筑工人写信给中央财经委员会，报告了这种情况。今年一月上旬，铁道部在中央财委会指令下，督责郑州局追究此事，郑州局才开始注意，进行检查，发现了上述情况，并即着手处理。
    为什么发生了这种严重的事件呢？该局工务处负责人说：“当时铁道部拨来一百八十四亿元，物价一日波动数次，我们怕货币贬值，都有急于花钱的要求。”他们以这种心理，包修这项工程时，急急忙忙地就把工款的百分之五十，发给了包商；他们只想到货币会贬值，却没有审查狡猾包商的标价。他们从没有细细地算一下账。比如水塔的标价，规定基础土方每立方单价是小麦九十五斤；但经确实计算，最多只需十五斤就够了。每方土多算小麦达八十斤，每座水塔以八百土方计算，十六座共多算小麦一百零二万四千斤。又如：基础木桩的机件和油料消费一项标价，完全是不合理的。包商既然列出打木桩的工价，显然是用人工打桩，那么在人工打椿中，那来机件和油料消费的费用呢？该局没有发现这笔糊涂账，所以也就无从找出弊病了。
    这种不了解下情、不研究实际情况的官僚主义作风，在整个郑州局中是普遍存在的。因此，在工程建设方面就表现了无组织无计划的严重的缺点和紊乱的局面，贪污分子及投机奸商乃得乘机袭入。比如在修建十六座水塔的计划中，原拟定在砀山建一座水塔；但据后来的了解，砀山原有一百吨砖座水塔还可使用。以致发包之后，又临时停工。又如：郑州地区去年同时修筑两个机车库，铁路局修一个，机务处自修一个（只有一个就够用了），位置选择又极不适当，这是最大的浪费。像这些贪污浪费的例子，在郑州路局是不胜枚举的，是普遍而又严重的问题，不仅工务部门如此，其他部门也不亚于工务部门。过去该局所属范围内存在的贪污浪费案件，曾被揭发数起，但并未彻底地明确地给以应有的处分，以致邪气成风，给国家财产造成了严重的损失。
    去年一年来，该局曾做了不少的工作，诸如抢修线路，支援百万大军南下，大规模补修线路，整理郑州车站，清理堵塞，以及运输效率的逐渐进步，都有好的成绩。但是由于领导作风改进很少，所以这些成绩也就无法巩固和继续深入。该局工务处长说，他们整天忙批示，赶报告，东抓一把，西摸一下，处理了这一堆，又来了另一堆，顾近失远，顾此失彼，顾上失下，有时忙到夜里一点、两点、三点，甚至通宵，还没有忙出个名堂来。他们都被各种枝枝节节的琐事拖住了。郑州局在具体工作领导上，曾经长期存在无人负责的现象。自上而下地弥漫着旧的一套“核准”、“遵办”、“照办”的官僚文牍作风，工作上忙乱无章，无计划、无中心、无步骤，对上不报告情况，对下不解决问题。这样，在去年雨季以前，他们就不可能抓住养路工作的中心环节。因而雨季到来，京汉、陇海两路事故层出，产生了严重的堵塞情况。
    由于官僚主义的作崇，就使得该局所属机构内缺乏政治空气，正气不能升扬，邪气占了上风，机关工作散漫松懈，至今尚存在着在办公室内调笑女职员，曾经长年养着旧戏班子（唱的都是有毒的旧戏）的不可容忍的现象，该局负责人对于这些现象是熟视无睹的。对旧职员的教育也极为不够。郑州局成立两年了，有些员工中还存在着敷衍塞责，“国事管他娘”的态度。他们闹派别，明争暗斗，安排私人。有些落后分子，看见积极职工热情工作，竟然讽刺地说：“你们干来干去，最多是个‘奴才’；我们就是这样，再过几年，还是个‘人才’。”这些落后分子对待人民铁路建设事业是采取“四面见光，瞒上不瞒下”的两面态度，既不求进步，也不好好工作，在技术业务上十分保守，对新事物极端抵抗。而郑州局负责人对待这些落后人员及其思想作风缺乏严肃的教育改造工作。个别腐化落后的分子，见有机可乘，大肆为非作恶。因而，水塔事件的发生绝不是偶然的。
