The basic spirit of labor-capital mutual benefit is to protect the rights and interests of workers while also taking into account the reasonable and legitimate profits of capitalists.

In the past six months, labor bureaus in various provinces and cities have gained the following basic experiences in mediating labor-capital disputes: First, mediation is not unprincipled reconciliation, nor is it taking a "peace at any price" attitude. Instead, it should be based on the position of mutual benefit for both labor and capital, ensuring the workers' due rights and interests while also taking into account the appropriate profits of the capitalists, in order to achieve the goal of unity and production. Except for revealing and criticizing unreasonable capitalists and using arbitration, for capitalists who can still implement policies, patient reasoning and persuasion should be used based on policies and regulations to make them voluntarily reach an agreement. Second, dispute resolution should be based on facts, conduct investigation and research, listen to both parties' opinions as much as possible, and discuss with relevant departments such as trade unions and industry associations to find the crux of the problem, clarify right and wrong, and handle them separately. Any subjective or careless approach will lead to improper handling. Third, political issues should be distinguished from labor-capital relations issues, and the two should not be confused. Labor-capital disputes must be mediated and decided first, and political issues should be handed over to relevant authorities for handling. Fourth, the mass line should be followed. Each mediation should invite people from the trade union and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to participate, so that workers can research and discuss with each other, and both parties can persuade the capitalists. This can not only quickly and reasonably resolve disputes, but also educate everyone. Fifth, for complex disputes or those involving the business of relevant government departments, the relevant competent departments should be invited to jointly judge the situation, unify understanding, and solve the problem together. Sixth, after the dispute is resolved, both parties should be urged to implement the decision, thereby checking the correctness of the decision, correcting deviations at any time, and summarizing experience to improve work. In addition, there are still some shortcomings in the dispute resolution work in various places. For example, some cadres do not have a correct understanding of policies and often treat capitalists in the same way as landlords are struggled against in rural areas, or simply issue orders, causing dissatisfaction among capitalists. Some cadres have an unclear understanding of the labor-capital mutual benefit policy, believing that labor-capital mutual benefit means equal sharing, treating labor and capital equally, without understanding that workers have historically suffered severe exploitation and oppression by capitalists. Therefore, the basic spirit of labor-capital mutual benefit is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers, restrict the excessive exploitation of capitalists, and at the same time take into account their reasonable and legitimate profits. Some cadres do not distinguish between speculative capitalists and capitalists who abide by laws and regulations and engage in production that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods and obtain appropriate profits. In some places, trade unions or trade union cadres take over the mediation work, without concentrating on resolving it in the labor bureau, forming a chaotic situation. Therefore, it should be clarified that trade unions can only represent workers in negotiating with capitalists and should not stand between workers and capitalists to mediate. Mediation and arbitration are the tasks of the labor bureau, but the labor bureau must work in close contact with the trade union.

　　劳资两利基本精神是保护劳动者权益
    同时照顾资方合理正当利润
    半年来，各省市劳动局在调处劳资纠纷的工作中，已取得以下基本经验：其一，调解不是无原则的调和，不是采取和事老的态度，而应当站在劳资两利的立场，保证工人应得权益，同时照顾资方适当利润，以达团结生产的目的。除对蛮不讲理的资方应予揭露批判并使用仲裁外，对尚能执行政策的资方，则应根据政策法令耐心地评理说服，使其自愿地达到协议。其二，调处纠纷应实事求是，进行调查研究，尽量听取双方意见，并与有关部门如工会和同业公会等共同商讨，才能找出问题的症结，弄清是非，分别处理。任何主观主义、粗枝大叶的作法都将调处不当。其三，应将政治问题与劳资关系问题区别开来，不能混为一谈。劳资纠纷须首先调处，作出决定，政治问题则送交有关机关处理。其四，要走群众路线，每次调解均邀请工会与工商业联合会派人参加，使工人得以互相研究商讨，使双方能说服资方，这样不但能迅速合理地解决纠纷，而且使大家多得教育。其五，情况复杂的纠纷或牵涉到政府有关机关部门业务时，则应邀请各该主管部门，共同判断情况，统一认识，共同解决。其六，纠纷调处后要督促双方执行，从而检查决定的正确性，发现偏差随时纠正，并总结经验提高工作。此外，各地调处工作中尚有若干缺点，例如有些干部对政策了解不正确，往往用农村斗争地主的方式来对待资本家，或简单命令行事，引起资方不满。有些干部对劳资两利政策认识不清，以为劳资两利就是半斤八两，对劳资双方等同齐观，而不了解工人历来受着资本家苛重的剥削和压迫，因此，劳资两利的基本精神为保护劳动者的正当权益，限制资本家的过分剥削，同时照顾其合理正当的利润。有些干部对投机倒把的资本家与遵守法令进行有益于国计民生的生产而获取适当利润的资本家不加分别处理。有些地方工会或工会干部包办代替调处工作，不集中到劳动局解决，形成混乱状态。因此应明确工会只能代表工人与资方谈判协商，不应站在工人和资本家之间来进行调解，调解与仲裁均为劳动局任务，但劳动局须与工会取得密切联系进行工作。
