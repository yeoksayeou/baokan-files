This is a pair of American-made shackles. In this concentration camp of murder, American imperialism's instruments of slaughtering patriotic people are everywhere. On the blood-soaked ground, piles of handcuffs and fetters can be found everywhere.

Living coffin - one type of killing instrument.

This is American-made electrocution equipment used to kill patriotic people, destroyed by enemy agents before their escape.

Guard posts and alarm bells were densely distributed within a 30-li radius of the Sino-American Special Technical Cooperative Organization. The bell rang every ten minutes, and each sentry post echoed each other, creating a terrifying impression to prevent those being watched from escaping.

This is a panoramic view of the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperative Organization" (a concentration camp for the massacre of patriotic and progressive people) jointly organized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and American imperialism.
