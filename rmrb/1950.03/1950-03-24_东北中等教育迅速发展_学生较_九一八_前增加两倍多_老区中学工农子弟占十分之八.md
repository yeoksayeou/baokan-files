Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 22nd: Northeast China's rapidly developing secondary education now boasts 270 middle schools with over 150,000 students. Compared to the period before the "September 18th Incident," the number of schools has increased by 10.6%, and student enrollment has surged by 270%. While the number of schools has decreased compared to the puppet Manchukuo era, the student population has more than doubled. The proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds has also significantly increased. According to incomplete statistics, children of poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants account for over 51% of the total number of students in middle schools in the old revolutionary base areas, while children of workers account for 36%, and children of revolutionary cadres account for 0.99%. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, there are over 9,100 middle school students, of which over 60% are children of working people. Currently, to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, secondary education in various regions is being consolidated and improved on the basis of restoration and development. At the same time, efforts are continuing to expand the enrollment of working-class and peasant youth and children, and to establish short-term secondary schools for workers and peasants, as well as spare-time supplementary education for workers, in order to cultivate a large number of construction talents from worker and peasant backgrounds for the country.

Over the past four years, Northeast China's secondary education has, as a result of implementing the policy of integrating education with practice, implementing the policy of transforming and cultivating intellectuals, and focusing on political education, established a relatively solid ideology of serving the people and a revolutionary outlook on life among students in the old revolutionary base areas. Students in the new liberated areas, after more than a year of transformation, have also initially established an ideology of serving the people and a more correct attitude towards learning.

Linking with the Liberation War and land reform to train a large number of revolutionary cadres. Serving production and construction, moving towards standardization.

The development of secondary education in Northeast China can be roughly divided into two stages: The first stage was from the winter of 1945 to the summer of 1948, and its main characteristic was that education work was linked to the Liberation War and land reform. At that time, to meet objective needs, schools adopted short-term training courses and compiled some new textbooks to replace textbooks with reactionary content. In this stage, all schools focused on winning over and transforming educated youth as the center of education work, and carried out political education in coordination with the land reform movement. In total, from the spring of 1947 to the summer of 1948, 26,000 students participated in revolutionary work or entered cadre schools. The second stage is from the autumn of 1948 to the present, and its main characteristic is to shift education to serve production and construction. The central task of education is to cultivate junior cadres and primary school teachers, and to prepare reserves for colleges and universities. At the same time, the establishment of a regular education system was proposed. Under this new policy, Northeast China's secondary education has taken a big step forward in the past year. All schools have shifted from short-term training courses to regular schools, from focusing on political classes to focusing on cultural classes (cultural classes account for 90%), and have overcome the chaos of lacking plans and systems. They have begun to establish systems for commencement, examinations, promotion, and demotion, and have formulated education plans, which has greatly improved the teaching enthusiasm of teachers and students, and teaching achievements have made significant progress. However, there are still many difficulties and shortcomings in secondary education work in various regions. The main problems are that students' cultural levels are low and uneven, and the quality and quantity of teachers are insufficient. The shortcomings in education methods are that education plans and teaching progress are not realistic, the curriculum is heavy, and there are too many extracurricular activities, which make teachers and students too busy and affect normal teaching. At the same time, on the one hand, teachers still seriously have the simple injection-style education method, and on the other hand, some schools overemphasize "self-study guidance," ignore the role of teachers, and let students freely discuss in class without guidance, resulting in laissez-faire. Individual schools overemphasize collective mutual assistance among students, forming a bias of "filling in and making up," which puts a heavy burden on students with excellent grades.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the Fourth Education Conference of the Northeast People's Government last September decided that the basic policy of school education is to consolidate and improve existing achievements, lay the foundation for further development, and prepare for the arrival of the high tide of economic and cultural construction. The meeting also discussed effective ways to improve the quality of school education. In October, after the Ministry of Education issued the decision on improving secondary education work, various schools began to make appropriate adjustments to students' levels, grouping students with poor levels to provide remedial education, or holding remedial classes before enrollment and temporarily extending the study period. In order to improve the level of teachers, various provinces and cities have adopted intensive training, rotational training, and the establishment of a learning system for on-the-job teachers in the past semester, and universally implemented observation and teaching, achievement exhibitions, and on-site visits to learn political and teaching skills in order to master and improve their own skills. Last year, in terms of streamlining the curriculum, various regions also had some uniform regulations: for example, the weekly teaching time should not exceed 30 hours, and the average weekly extracurricular social activity time should be 6 hours, and it should be carried out in coordination with classroom education. This regulation gives teachers sufficient time to prepare lessons and grade homework, and students also have sufficient time to study on their own. In addition, there have been many improvements in teaching methods in various schools. For example, attention has been paid to the connection between theory and practice, especially in natural sciences, and the use of object teaching has been widely used. Teachers and students in various schools use their spare time to make and collect specimens, models, charts, etc., and visit factories and rural areas for on-site visits, which have benefited a lot.

　　东北中等教育迅速发展
    学生较“九一八”前增加两倍多  老区中学工农子弟占十分之八
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】迅速发展中的东北中等教育，现有中学二百七十所，学生达十五万余人，较“九一八”前，学校增加了百分之十点六，学生增加了百分之二百七十；与伪满时期相较虽学校数量减少，但学生数却增加了一倍以上。学生成份中，工农子弟的比重亦显著增加。根据不完全统计：老区中学学生总数中贫、雇、中农子弟占百分之五十一强，工人子弟占百分之三十六，革命干部子弟占百分之零点九九。如黑龙江省共有中学生九千一百余名，其中劳动人民的子弟已占百分之六十以上。现为适应大规模经济建设的需要，各地中等教育正在恢复与发展的基础上进行巩固与提高的工作，同时，并继续扩大招收工农青年及工农子弟和创办工农速成中学及工人业余补习教育，为国家培养大批工农出身的建设人材。
    过去四年中，东北中等教育由于执行了教育与实际结合、并贯彻了改造与培养知识分子的政策、抓紧政治教育的结果，现在老区的学生中已建立起较坚固的为人民服务的思想和革命的人生观；新区的学生经过一年余的改造，亦已初步树立为人民服务的思想和较正确的学习态度。
  联系解放战争与土地改革，训练大批革命干部。服务生产建设，
        走向正规化。
    东北中等教育的发展，大致可分为两个阶段：第一阶段是从一九四五年冬到一九四八年夏，其主要特点是教育工作与解放战争及土地改革相联系。那时，为适应客观需要，学校采取了短期训练班方式，同时编辑了一部分新教科书，以代替有反动内容的课本。在这一阶段中，各学校均确定争取和改造知识青年为教育工作的重心，配合当时土地改革运动的开展，进行政治教育。总计在一九四七年春至一九四八年夏这一期间，参加革命工作及升入干部学校的学生达二万六千人。第二阶段为一九四八年秋至现在，其主要特点是使教育转为生产建设服务，教育的中心任务是培养初级干部与小学教员，并为专科以上学校准备后备军；同时提出建立正规教育制度。在此新方针下，一年来东北中等教育已前进了一大步。各学校都由短期训练班方式转向正规学校，从以政治课为主转为以文化课为主（文化课占百分之九十），并克服了缺乏计划与制度的混乱现象，开始建立了始业、考试、升降级等制度，并制订了教育计划，使教员与学生的教学积极性大为提高，教学成绩有显著进步。但各地中等教育工作中还存在很多困难与缺点，主要是学生文化程度低而不齐，师资质量差，数量也不够。在教育方法上的缺点则是教育计划与教学进度不切实际，课程繁重，课外活动太多，以致教员、学生过分忙碌，影响了正常的教学。同时，一方面，教员中还严重地存在着单纯注入式的教育方法，另一方面，则有些学校过分强调“自学辅导”，忽视教员的作用，在上课时让学生自由讨论，而不加指导，以致放任自流。个别学校则在学生中过分强调集体互助，形成“填平补齐”的偏向，使成绩优良的学生负担很重。
    为克服上述缺点，去年九月东北人民政府第四次教育会议曾决定学校教育的基本方针是巩固与提高现有成绩，为进一步发展打下基础，以为经济、文化建设高潮的到来作好准备工作。会议并讨论了提高学校教育质量的有效办法。十月，教育部颁布了关于提高中等教育工作的决定后，各学校即开始在学生程度上作适当调整，将程度差的学生编组给以补习教育，或在入学前开办补习班和暂时延长修业期限等。各省、市为提高师资的水平，在上一学期多采取了集训、轮训和建立在职教师的学习制度，普遍实行观摩教学、成绩展览会及实地参观等办法，进行政治与教学业务的学习，以求精通和改进自己的业务。去年在精简课程方面，各地也有若干统一规定：如每周授课时间不超过三十小时，每周课外社会活动时间平均六小时，并配合课堂教育进行。这一规定使教员有较充分时间准备功课和批改作业，学生也有了充分时间自习。此外，各学校在教学法上亦有不少改进。如开始注意理论与实际的联系，特别是在自然科学方面，广泛地利用了实物教学。各校师生利用课余时间制作和搜集标本、模型、图表等，并赴工厂、农村实地参观，都得益很大。
