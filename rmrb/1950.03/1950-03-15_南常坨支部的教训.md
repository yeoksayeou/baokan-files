The lesson of the Nanchangtuo Branch

　　The Nanchangtuo Village Branch in the eighth district of Leting, Hebei, retreated and evaded in the face of a serious famine, abandoning its leadership in production for self-salvation. The county and district committees adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards this, failing to provide timely criticism, education, and specific assistance. It was not until February 3rd that the county party secretary went to the village to resolve the issue.
    Nanchangtuo Village is close to the Luan River and suffered flooding last year. The entire village of 705 people averaged only 13 jin of grain per person, and the disaster was extremely serious. At that time, the village branch not only failed to step forward and lead the masses in production for self-salvation but, like the masses, was frightened by the disaster. The fifteen party members were not united, and eight of them went to Lulong to beg for food. The branch secretary only engaged in personal production and even asked the district committee, saying, "We're not doing it anymore, choose someone else, we're going to the city to engage in production." The village chief (probationary party member) had enough grain to eat for four months and didn't care about others. All the party members were pessimistic, believing that there were many difficulties in production, and that begging required no capital and was the only way out. It was not until February 3rd that County Party Secretary Wang Min'an went to the village to hold a branch meeting to discuss how to lead the masses in production for self-salvation. Branch Secretary Peng Dianqin even said, "Production is doing well, 48 households are begging, and they can earn 300 jin of sweet potatoes per day, plus two sheng of rice porridge." When the idea of engaging in textiles was proposed, he said, "The elderly can't weave, and the young don't know how." The Communist Youth League also completely abandoned the task of uniting the masses for production and self-salvation, rigidly emphasizing learning, requiring three hours of study after returning from begging. At the same time, there was a bureaucratic work style among the county and district leaders. The district only provided general leadership to the village and did not actively and proactively come up with ways to specifically organize the masses for production and self-salvation. Village cadres emphasized that begging was better than production, and district cadres did not provide patient explanations. As a result, the number of households begging in the village increased to 72.
    Thus, the serious situation of the disaster in the village continued to exist. The village's sideline production never got off the ground. Most of the 68 male laborers relied on going to the Lulong area to beg for sweet potatoes; most of the women had nothing to do except for some weaving, mainly relying on selling things and begging for food. Currently, their clothes are about to be sold out, and it is difficult to beg, so many people have run out of food. The thoughts of the disaster victims are very confused. Some resigned themselves to fate and passively waited: such as Liang Laohe who said: "If heaven doesn't give us food, what can we do?" Others were "taking it one day at a time, dealing with each step as it comes." Some pinned their hopes on the empty assumption that "vegetables will be growing in the fields in a few days." Still, another thought was purely relying on government relief, a very typical saying was: "Anyway, the government guarantees that no one will starve to death, relief will come sooner or later." Furthermore, some of the masses, due to lack of livelihood, developed a world-weary idea of ​​"it's better to die than live." For example, Han Shuxia's mother said at the meeting: "Let me starve to death! Anyway, I've lived long enough."
    After County Party Secretary Wang Min'an discovered these problems, he immediately began to correct the village branch's erroneous thinking and helped them to formulate a plan: 1. Start all the machines and spinning wheels in the village, with the county providing loans for foreign yarn to purchase finished products. 2. Men dig up tree roots. Women make shoes to sell. Everyone gets to work, no idle households. 3. Immediately provide assistance to needy households and support production.
    In order to promote the work, the Tangshan Special District Production Relief Committee published this material in the production bulletin. And put forward the following opinions: 1. The county should conduct in-depth and specific leadership in the village, equip strong cadres to go deep into each household and group, mobilize production, cultivate backbones, and learn from experience to promote and influence the entire village. 2. Quickly eliminate the passive waiting mentality among the masses and enhance confidence in production for self-salvation. 3. Overcome the formalistic leadership methods of only investigating, filling out forms, and not doing specific organizational work. We must solve practical problems for disaster victims in the organization of production. 4. Strengthen education for village cadres and appropriately solve the production and life problems of village cadres, so as to promote and consolidate the village's production for self-salvation. 5. Conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of every village and household throughout the county to see if there are villages similar to Nanchangtuo Village, so as to seize specific leadership and carry out production for self-salvation.

　　南常坨支部的教训
    河北乐亭八区南常坨村支部，在严重的灾荒面前退缩逃避，放弃对生产自救的领导。县委区委对此采取官僚主义态度，未及时批评教育，也未作具体帮助。直到二月三日县委书记才到该村解决这一问题。
    南常坨村靠近滦河，去年遭受了水灾。全村七百零五人平均每人仅打粮食十三斤，灾情十分严重。当时该村支部不但没有挺身而起领导群众生产自救，反和群众一样的为灾荒所吓倒。十五个党员闹不团结，其中八个人到卢龙去要饭。支部书记只搞个人生产还到区委会要求说：“我们不干了，另选别人吧，我们到城里搞生产去。”村长（候补党员）自己有粮能吃四个月，不管别人。所有党员都是眼前漆黑一团，认为搞生产困难多，就是要饭不用本钱，是唯一的出路。直到二月三日县委书记王民安同志到该村召开支部会，研究如何领导群众生产自救时，支书彭殿勤还说：“生产搞的不错，四十八户要饭，每日可收入白薯三百斤，还有二升米的粥。”提出搞纺织时，他说：“年老的不织，年青的不会。”青年团也根本放弃团结群众生产自救的工作任务，死板地强调学习，要饭回来还得消耗三个钟头去学习。同时县区领导上存在官僚主义作风。区上对该村只是一般化的领导，不积极主动的想出办法具体组织群众生产自救。村干部强调要饭比搞生产好，区干部也不作耐心解释。因此，全村要饭户曾发展到七十二户。
    这样，该村灾情的严重情况一直存在。村里的副业生产始终没搞起来。男劳动力六十八人，多半靠到卢龙一带去要白薯；妇女除部分纺织外，大部无活做，主要是靠卖东西和要饭吃。目前衣物即将卖光，要饭又不好要，不少人都断了顿。灾民思想非常混乱。有的是听天由命，消极等待：如梁老合说：“老天爷不给饭吃，有啥办法？”有的是“过一天少一天，对付一步是一步。”有的是把希望凭空寄托在“不几天地里就出菜了”。还有一种思想是单纯依赖政府救济，一种很典型的说法是：“反正政府保证不饿死一个人，早晚得救济。”再有一部群众由于生活无着，产生“活着不如死了好”的厌世思想。如韩树霞的母亲在会场上就这样说：“饿死就饿死吧！反正活够了。”
    这些问题，经县委书记王民安同志发现后，即开始纠正了村支部的错误思想，并帮助他们订出了计划：一、动起全村机子和纺车，由县贷给洋纱收买成品。二、男人刨树根。妇女做鞋卖。人人都动手，户户无闲人。三、立即接济困难户，扶植搞生产。
    唐山专区生产救灾委员会为了推动工作，把这个材料在生产通报上发表了。并提出以下几点意见：一、县对该村应深入具体领导，配备有力干部深入到一户、一组，发动生产，培养骨干，吸取经验，以推动和影响全村。二、迅速消灭群众中消极等待思想，提高生产自救的信心。三、克服只调查、填表、不作具体组织工作的形式主义的领导方法，要在组织生产中给灾民解决实际问题。四、对村干部加强教育，并适当解决村干部的生产及生活问题，以便推动和巩固村的生产自救工作。五、在全县范围内进行普遍深入逐村逐户的检查，看是否还有类似南常坨村的村子，以便抓紧具体领导，开展生产自救。
