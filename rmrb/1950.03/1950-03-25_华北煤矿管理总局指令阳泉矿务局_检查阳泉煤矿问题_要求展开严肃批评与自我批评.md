　　North China Coal Mine Management Bureau Directs Yangquan Mining Bureau
    Investigate Problems at Yangquan Coal Mine
    Demands Serious Criticism and Self-Criticism
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The North China Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, on the 23rd, directed the Yangquan Mining Bureau to investigate the production problems existing in the Yangquan State-owned Coal Mine. The bureau and the North China State-owned Coal Mine Trade Union have formed an inspection team and are going to Yangquan to conduct on-site inspections. The full text of the North China Coal Mine Management Bureau's instructions to the Yangquan Mining Bureau is as follows:
    It has been found that the "People's Daily" on the first page of the 21st of this month published: "Serious problems exist in the Yangquan State-owned Coal Mine," "Feudal foremen exploit workers," "Production plans have repeatedly failed," "The root cause is that the mine's leading cadres do not know how to rely on the workers," etc. After receiving this news, the General Bureau immediately convened relevant departments to discuss it, and unanimously agreed that the reported materials were indeed in line with the actual situation. We give strong support to Yangquan Mine's future transformation of this unreasonable production management system, and it also has profound educational significance for other mines.
    The General Bureau repeatedly pointed out at the coal industry conference in September 1949 that feudal foreman remnants still existed in Yangquan and other mines, that they did not rely on workers, and that production was manipulated by the foremen. It was also proposed that democracy must be developed, foremen must be abolished, workers' awareness must be raised, and workers must control production themselves. Minister Chen also emphasized in his concluding remarks to the conference that "to do a good job in production, we must rely on the workers." However, certain individual leading cadres of Yangquan Mine resisted this idea, believing that production was impossible without the group leaders (who are the renamed foremen). This erroneous view persisted until January 1950, when the General Bureau convened another meeting of the heads of various mining bureaus to specifically discuss how to implement democratic management, rely on workers, and resolutely eliminate the remnants of feudal foremen. It was clearly pointed out that this phenomenon was more serious in Yangquan, Jingxing, and Jiaozuo.
    After this meeting, the responsible cadres of the various mining bureaus were ideologically prepared and formulated this work in their work plans. However, past mistakes have caused significant losses in production. Although the Yangquan Mining Bureau has included the elimination of foreman remnants as a major task in its four-month work plan for 1950, there are still ideological concerns about reviewing past mistakes, feeling that as long as the mistakes are corrected, there is no need to review them, otherwise it will cause personnel disputes and hinder future work. This view is also very wrong, and is clearly surrendering and compromising to erroneous thinking. It is not good for people, oneself, or the work. It must be known that to correct a wrong job, one must first review the error, recognize the error, and trace the root cause of the error in thinking, so that the foundation of the corrected new work can be strong and clear.
    Therefore, the Yangquan Mining Bureau is specifically instructed to immediately start arranging this work after receiving this order, convene various cadre meetings above and below the well, absorb good workers to participate, and launch serious criticism and self-criticism. Conduct an in-depth review with reference to the materials of your mine in the People's Daily, and report the results of the review to the General Bureau in writing. As for how to develop democracy and eliminate the remnants of foremen in the future, the General Bureau and the preparatory committee of the North China Coal Mine Trade Union will issue joint instructions separately.
    [Another dispatch] The North China State-owned Coal Mine Administration and the North China State-owned Coal Mine Trade Union have now formed a Yangquan problem inspection team with six staff members. Led by Comrade Dong Xiuqing, director of the trade union, they are going to Yangquan Coal Mine for specific assistance and on-site inspection.

　　华北煤矿管理总局指令阳泉矿务局
    检查阳泉煤矿问题
    要求展开严肃批评与自我批评
    【本报讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部华北煤矿管理总局，于二十三日指令阳泉矿务局，检查阳泉国营煤矿生产上所存在的问题。该局与华北国营煤矿工会，并已组成检查组，前往阳泉实地检查。华北煤矿管理总局对阳泉矿务局的指令，全文如下：
    查本月二十一日人民日报第一版刊载：“阳泉国营煤矿存在严重问题”，“封建把头剥削工人”“生产计划屡遭失败”“根本原因该矿领导干部不知依靠工人”等，总局接获这一消息后，立即召集有关部门人员进行讨论，一致认为报导材料确合实际。对阳泉矿今后改造这种不合理的生产管理制度给予有力支持，对其他矿厂亦有深刻的教育意义。
    总局曾在一九四九年九月煤业会议上，一再指出阳泉等矿，迄今尚存在封建把头残余，不依靠工人，生产操纵在把头手中。并提出一定要开展民主，撤销把头，提高工人觉悟，由工人自己掌握生产等。陈部长在大会总结中也强调这一点“要想搞好生产必须依靠工人”。但阳泉矿的某些个别领导干部，思想抵触，认为离开大组长（就是把头的改名）是不能生产的。这一错误观点，一直延至一九五○年一月，总局又召开各矿务局局长会议，专门讨论了如何实行民主管理，依靠工人，坚决肃清封建把头残余，明确指出阳泉井陉焦作这种现象较为严重。
    经过此次会议，各矿务局负责干部，在思想上有了准备，在其工作计划中制定了这一项工作。但以往的错误，已使生产受到重大损失。阳泉矿务局在一九五○年四个月工作计划中，虽已将肃清把头残余提为主要工作，但对以往错误的检讨，思想上尚有顾虑，觉得只要改错，即可不必检讨，否则会惹起人事纠纷妨碍今后工作。这种看法也是十分错误的，显然是向错误思想投降妥协。对人对己对工作均无好处。必须知道从一件错了的工作上改正过来，必须首先检讨错误，认识错误，追究错误思想根源，才能使改正的新工作基础，有力而又明确。
    因此特指令阳泉矿局接令后，立即着手布置这一工作，召开井上井下各种干部会议，吸收好的工人参加，展开严肃的批评与自我批评。参照人民日报对你矿的材料进行深入的检讨，并将检讨的结果书面报告总局为要。至于今后如何开展民主，肃清把头残余，总局与华北煤矿总工会筹委会另有联合指示。
    【又讯】华北国营煤矿管理局与华北国营煤矿工会，现已组成有六位工作人员参加的阳泉问题检查组。由该工会主任董秀清同志率领，前往阳泉煤矿作具体帮助与实地检查。
