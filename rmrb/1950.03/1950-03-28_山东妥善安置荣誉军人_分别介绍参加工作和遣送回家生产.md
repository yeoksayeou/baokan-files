Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 27th: Shandong Province has achieved preliminary results in the education and resettlement of honored servicemen. From April of last year to February of this year, a period of nine months, the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Honored Servicemen successively received a total of 38,319 honored servicemen. After treatment, recuperation, and short-term study, over 2,600 have participated in work in front-line and rear-area troops; over 500 have been introduced to work in local areas; over 23,000 are studying in various honored servicemen schools within the province; and approximately 12,000 are still undergoing treatment, recuperation, or are being transferred to various regions for resettlement.

　　Honored servicemen initially generally experienced pessimism and despair after being wounded, with many concerns. Honored servicemen schools, addressing their ideological situation, first strengthened political education, enhancing their political consciousness through grievance sessions, and conducted current affairs studies and education on new district policies. After a certain period of political education, they generally overcame pessimism and further solidified their class stance and the idea of serving the people, thus achieving great success in production, disaster relief, and serving the masses. In May of last year, honored servicemen in various regions helped farmers harvest over 1.3 million mu of wheat under the call of their superiors.

　　Honored servicemen generally actively participate in labor production after returning home. According to statistics from eleven counties in Jiaodong: among 7,559 honored servicemen, 6,319 participated in agricultural production, 292 engaged in handicrafts, 198 engaged in fishing, 24 engaged in salt production, 33 engaged in transportation, and 69 served as primary school teachers, with a total of 94% of the honored servicemen participating in production; in addition, 26 are attending middle school. Some disabled honored servicemen are also engaged in sideline production such as making straw hat braids, twisting straw ropes, and spinning yarn.

　　Honored servicemen in rural areas also actively participated in rural political power and supported the front lines. In the first half of 1949, 1,491 honored servicemen in twelve counties including Rongcheng and Rushan in Jiaodong participated in rural political work, with 95 serving as village chiefs and 171 as heads of farmers' associations. According to current statistics, 6,000 honored servicemen throughout Jiaodong have participated in village political work. In terms of production supporting the front lines: 95 honored servicemen labor models emerged in Rongcheng County, Jiaodong; in Xujia Village, Yexian County, under the leading influence of seven honored servicemen, 180 households paid their public grain in full in one day.

　　Local governments at all levels attach great importance to absorbing honored servicemen to participate in local work and actively help them solve various difficulties. According to statistics from Jibei, Zou County, and Sishui County in Luzhongnan: after 302 honored servicemen were demobilized, they received 6,606 mu of land and 409 rooms. The marriage problems of 222 honored servicemen in the Nishan Special Zone of Luzhongnan were resolved with the assistance of local governments and mass organizations. The work of masses helping honored servicemen with farming has become widespread, but due to the increased political awareness and production enthusiasm of the honored servicemen, substitute farming has gradually decreased. For example, in Rushan County, 117 mu of land belonging to sixteen honored servicemen was farmed by others last year, but this year only 20 mu is being farmed by others.

　　The students of the honored servicemen schools enthusiastically responded to the call to conserve and provide disaster relief. For example, the Third Honored Servicemen School saved more than 63,000 jin of grain in February to help disaster victims, and the students also voluntarily donated large quantities of shoes, socks, towels, etc., to the disaster victims. Students from honored servicemen schools in various regions helped disaster victims organize mutual aid groups for production and launched production for self-salvation. The disaster victims were extremely moved to see that even though the honored servicemen were missing arms and legs, they were still so actively helping them with production. Many people changed their thinking of simply relying on government relief and planned to carry out production for self-salvation.

　　The work concerning honored servicemen in Shandong Province also has some shortcomings: some individual cadres in some regions do not have a sufficient understanding of the work concerning honored servicemen, and some are not responsible enough in handling honored servicemen, neither educating them nor appropriately allocating work after receiving them, causing long delays and consequently leading to low morale among the honored servicemen. These shortcomings have been noted by the Shandong Provincial People's Government and are being addressed and corrected.

　　山东妥善安置荣誉军人
    分别介绍参加工作和遣送回家生产
    【新华社济南二十七日电】山东地区教育和安置荣誉军人的工作已有初步成绩。自去年四月至今年二月这九个月中，山东省荣誉军人管理局先后共接收了荣誉军人三万八千三百十九名。经治疗、休养和短期学习后，参加前后方部队工作的有二千六百余名；介绍参加地方工作的有五百余名；在省内各荣誉军人学校学习的有二万三千余名；尚在继续治疗、休养或转送各地区分别安置者约一万二千余名。
    荣誉军人负伤后最初一般地产生了悲观失望情绪，顾虑很多。荣誉军人学校针对他们的思想情况，首先加强政治教育，经过诉苦会提高他们的政治觉悟，并进行时事学习和新区政策教育。经过了一定时期的政治教育后，他们一般地都克服了悲观情绪，进一步地坚定了阶级立场和为人民服务的思想，因此在生产、救灾、为群众服务等各方面都有很大的成绩。去年五月间各地荣誉军人在上级号召下帮助农民割麦一百三十多万亩。
    荣誉军人回家后一般都能积极参加劳动生产。据胶东十一县的统计：七千五百五十九位荣誉军人中，参加农业生产的有六千三百十九人，作手工业生产的有二百九十二人，作渔业生产的一百九十八人，作盐业生产的二十四人，作运输生产的三十三人，当小学教员的六十九人，总共参加生产的占荣誉军人全数的百分之九十四；另外还有二十六人进中学念书。一些残废了的荣誉军人，也从事作草帽辫、搓草绳、纺纱等副业生产。
    荣誉军人在乡村中还积极地参加了乡村政权和支援前线的工作。一九四九年上半年，胶东荣城、乳山等十二县，有荣誉军人一千四百九十一人参加了乡村政权工作，内有九十五人任村长，一百七十一人当了农会会长。据现在的统计，全胶东有荣誉军人六千人参加了村政权工作。在生产支援前线方面：胶东荣城一个县就出现了荣誉军人劳动模范九十五人；掖南县徐家村的一百八十户人家，在七名荣誉军人带头影响下，一天内就缴完了公粮。
    各级地方政府都很重视吸收荣誉军人参加地方工作，并且积极帮助他们解决各种困难。据鲁中南济北、邹县、泗水三个县的统计：三百零二名荣誉军人复员后，得到土地六千六百零六亩，房子四百零九间。鲁中南尼山专区有二百二十二名荣誉军人的婚姻问题，在当地政府和群众团体协助下，得到解决。群众帮助荣誉军人代耕的工作，已普遍做到，但由于荣誉军人政治认识和生产情绪的提高，代耕也逐渐减少。如乳山县十六名荣誉军人的耕地中去年代耕的有一百十七亩，今年代耕的只有二十亩。
    荣誉军人学校的学员们都热烈地响应节约救灾的号召，如第三荣誉军人学校在二月份节约了六万三千多斤粮食救助灾民，学员们个人也自动捐出大批鞋、袜、毛巾等送给灾民。各地的荣誉军人学校学员们，帮助灾民组织生产互助组，展开生产自救。灾民们看见他们缺胳膊少腿还这样积极帮助他们搞生产，极为感动，很多人改变了单纯依赖政府救济的思想而作生产自救的打算。
    山东省的荣誉军人工作也存在着一些缺点：有些地区个别干部对荣誉军人工作认识还不够，有的在处理荣誉军人的方法上不够负责任，接收后既不教育、又不适当地分配工作，长期拖延，因而使荣誉军人情绪低落。这些缺点，在山东省人民政府发现后，已注意予以克服和纠正。
