　　Henan Holds Tax Work Conference
    Determines This Year's Tax Policy
    Resolves to Strengthen Tax Collection and Launch Anti-Tax Evasion Struggle
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Henan Daily News of March 17th: In order to overcome financial difficulties, guarantee the realization of this year's provincial financial revenue and expenditure budget, and correctly implement the new tax law promulgated by the central government, the Henan Provincial People's Government Taxation Bureau convened the province's second tax work conference on February 23rd. The conference lasted for twelve days and concluded on the 7th of this month. Attendees included the directors of special district and municipal taxation bureaus, as well as the directors of key county and city taxation bureaus, totaling more than 20 people. The conference listened to a report by Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, on the current situation and work tasks. Ji Jinzhang, Deputy Director of the Provincial Government's Finance Department and Director of the Taxation Bureau, conveyed the resolutions of the National Tax Conference. This conference basically resolved the issue of unifying ideas on tax policy, exchanged work experiences from various regions, and studied issues such as improving institutions, allocating cadres, strengthening tax collection, blocking loopholes, and increasing tax revenue, laying the foundation for the smooth development of tax work in the future.

    Correct Implementation of Tax Policy
    Industry and Commerce Has Developed
    The conference first summarized the province's tax work last year, which achieved significant results and experiences in recovery and rectification. It played a certain role in overcoming national financial difficulties, withdrawing currency from circulation, and stabilizing financial prices. According to statistics from July to December, last year's tax revenue exceeded the original task assigned by the Central China Taxation Administration by 50%, totaling 43,944,925,590 yuan, equivalent to 149,977,660 kilograms of wheat. Zhengzhou exceeded its task by 178.3%, and the completion rates of Shangqiu, Xuchang, Luoyang and other special districts were also above 100%. The conference pointed out that these achievements were accomplished under the direct leadership and assistance of party and government organs at all levels, and the active and responsible efforts of all cadres. In the implementation process, the policy of "industry lighter than commerce, necessities lighter than luxuries" was followed, thus enabling the proper development of legitimate industry and commerce. The conference also criticized several shortcomings and deviations that existed in tax work over the past year. Among individual cadres, there was a lack of clarity in tax policy thinking, unfamiliarity with business, indiscriminate taxation in violation of tax laws, and phenomena of corruption and dereliction of duty. Another serious problem in the work was tax evasion. According to reports from various localities, this tax evasion accounted for more than 60% of the province's tax revenue. In addition, some cadres held a purely "benevolent governance" view towards the tax payments of industrialists and merchants, blindly believing the cries of individual industrialists and merchants that taxes were too heavy, and wanting to reduce the task. In the democratic appraisal during taxation, the leadership lacked in-depth understanding and control, and in individual areas, there was a deviation of small households squeezing out large households, and large households bullying small households, resulting in unfair burdens and uneven distribution.

    Strive to Make the Burden Fair and Reasonable
    Ensure Tax Payments are Deposited on Time
    Based on the above situation, the conference adopted the following tax work policy for 1950: 1. In terms of policy: A. In the implementation of various tax laws, all regulations of the higher authorities (i.e., various tax laws) should be implemented. Taxes that should be collected must be collected, and taxes that should not be collected must not be collected indiscriminately. Strive not to miss any taxes, and oppose the tendency of disorganization and indiscipline in the implementation of policies. B. In industrial and commercial tax collection, it is necessary to earnestly achieve guided democratic appraisal, adjust scores based on evidence, eliminate the deviation of small households squeezing out large households and large households bullying small households, so that the burden is fair and reasonable, and the goal of economic prosperity is achieved. 2. In terms of methods: Improve various systems, oppose corruption and waste, strengthen tax collection methods, launch a struggle against tax evasion, complete tasks, and ensure that tax payments are deposited on time. 3. In terms of cadres and institutions: Improve institutions, allocate cadres, and conduct rotations to improve policy theory and business technology.

    As for the progress of work, the establishment of systems, the training and allocation of cadres, as well as the correction of deviations and the conduct of anti-evasion struggles, the conference also made specific plans and arrangements, and allocated this year's tax tasks based on the concentration, dispersion, and abundance of tax sources in various parts of the province. The conference unanimously stated that as long as the decrees issued by the Central People's Government, the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, and the Provincial Government are correctly implemented, and the tax policy is implemented, the province's huge tax tasks this year will definitely be guaranteed to be completed.

　　河南召开税务工作会议
    确定今年税收方针
    决加强稽征工作展开反漏税斗争
    【本报讯】据三月十七日河南日报消息：为克服财政困难，保证今年全省财政收支概算的实现，并正确贯彻中央颁布的新税法，河南省人民政府税务局于二月二十三日召开的全省第二届税务工作会议，历时十二天，已于本月七日结束。出席会议者有专区、市税务局长，及重点县市税务局长共二十余人。会议听取了省府吴芝圃主席关于目前形势与工作任务的报告，省府财政厅副厅长兼税务局长纪锦章传达了全国税务会议的决议。此次会议基本上解决了统一税收政策思想，交流了各地区工作经验，研究了健全机构，配备干部，加强稽征，堵塞偷漏，增加税收等问题，给今后打下了顺利开展税务工作的基础。
    正确执行税收政策
    工商业得到了发展
    会议首先总结了全省去年税收工作，在恢复整顿中获得了重大成绩与经验。对克服国家财政困难，回笼货币，稳定金融物价起了一定的作用。去年税收，据七月至十二月的统计：完成额即超过原华中税务总局分配任务的百分之五十，计收入四三、九四四、九二五、五九○元，折合小麦一四九、九七七、六六○斤，郑州超过任务百分之一百七十八点三，商邱、许昌、洛阳等专区的完成额也在百分之百以上。这些成绩，大会指出系在各级党政机关直接领导、帮助，与全体干部积极负责努力下完成的。在执行中掌握了工业轻于商业、必需品轻于奢侈品的政策，因此使正当的工商业得到了发展。会议也将过去一年来税收工作中存在着的若干缺点与偏向进行了批判。在个别干部中，税收政策思想模糊，业务不熟练，不按税法滥征，和贪污渎职现象。另一工作上严重存在着的问题，为偷税漏税问题。据各地汇报了解，此项偷漏即占全省税收的百分之六十以上。另外有些干部对工商业者纳税，存在单纯的“仁政”观点，盲目地听信个别工商业者的叫喊税重，想把任务减低。在征税时对民主评议一点，领导上缺乏深入了解掌握，个别地区发生小户挤大户，大户欺小户的偏向，因之，产生了负担不公，畸轻畸重的现象。
    务使负担公平合理
    保证税款按时入库
    会议根据以上情况，通过了一九五○年税收工作方针如下：一、在政策方面：甲、在各种税法的执行中，应贯彻执行上级的一切规定（即各种税法），该收的必收，不该收的不乱收；争取不漏税，反对在执行政策上的无组织、无纪律倾向。乙、在工商业税收上要切实做到有领导的民主评议，有根据的调整分数，消灭小户挤大户，大户欺小户的偏向，使负担公平合理，达到繁荣经济之目的。二、在方法上：健全各种制度，反对贪污浪费，加强稽征方法，开展反漏税斗争，完成任务，并保证税款按时入库。三、干部与机构方面：健全机构，配备干部，并进行轮训，在政策理论上、业务技术上提高一步。
    至于工作的进行，制度的建立，干部的培养与配备，以及纠正偏向，进行反偷漏斗争等问题，大会亦均作了具体的计划与布置，并根据全省各地税收的税源的集中、分散、丰裕情况，分配了今年税收任务。大会一致表示只要正确地执行中央人民政府、中南军政委会及省政府所发布的法令，贯彻税收政策，就一定能保证完成今年全省巨大的税收任务。
