Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. The East China Military and Political Committee passed instructions on the 21st regarding preparatory work for land reform. Based on the State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions on land reform and public grain collection in newly liberated areas, the instructions require the East China region (excluding Taiwan) to complete the task of land reform within the next two years. The instructions point out that in the new areas of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces, and parts of Fujian province, after this year's autumn harvest, land distribution can begin in areas where land reform preparations have been completed and the masses' awareness and organization have reached the required level. In the aforementioned provinces, if, at that time, there are still certain areas where preparations, mass awareness, and organization are insufficient, or where there is bandit harassment, the provincial and administrative region people's governments will decide whether or not to distribute land in 1950, and wait until after the autumn harvest of 1951 to distribute land. The instructions also emphasize that all preparatory steps related to land reform must be closely integrated with production and disaster relief, as well as preparations for famine. The instructions also stipulate that the following tasks should be completed rapidly during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of this year: (1) Investigate the rural situation in the new areas; (2) Before the autumn harvest, each province should, in batches, concentrate county, district, and township-level cadres and work teams to conduct education on land reform; (3) Universal publicity and education on land reform policies should also be carried out for people of all strata; (4) Leading personnel of provincial, administrative region, special district, and county-level leading organs should personally lead the typical experimental work of land reform; (5) At the beginning of this year's autumn grain collection, cadres participating in land reform must go to the countryside to carry out autumn grain collection and land reform work; (6) In some areas where bandits have not yet been completely eliminated, bandits should be quickly suppressed; where rent reduction has not yet been carried out, rent reduction should be implemented immediately; (7) Localities should reform some district and township-level regimes with impure elements during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. The instructions finally point out that in order to ensure the implementation of land reform policies and the orderly conduct of land reform, leading organs at all levels must concentrate their efforts, strengthen the work of peasant associations and the leadership of land reform, and resolutely overcome any phenomena of acting on one's own and anarchic indiscipline in land reform.
