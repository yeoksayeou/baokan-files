　　Beijing Convenes Private Factory Owners' Symposium
    Discussing Detailed Rules for Aiding Unemployed Workers

    [Beijing News] The preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium on the 4th with more than 100 private factory heads to discuss the implementation of the municipal government's trial detailed rules for aiding unemployed workers. Since the municipal government promulgated the trial detailed rules, only more than 100 households have paid the February relief fund so far. Among private industries, 22 industries such as carpets and knitting have not yet started. At the symposium, the heads of various factories first raised the problems encountered in the implementation, and then Wan Yi, deputy director of the Labor Bureau, answered them separately. He explained that this decree was passed by the First Session of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference and was formulated after repeated and careful consideration by the government. After its promulgation, most factory owners and workers in private factories were able to recognize that this was conducive to the development of production, enabling factories and workshops to obtain reasonable improvements in management and appropriately protect the lives of workers. However, some factory owners do not have a correct understanding, regarding the payment of the relief fund as a burden, and even regarding this money as a part of the government's financial revenue. In fact, judging from the number of payments, state-owned factories account for 76 percent of the total, while private factories account for only 24 percent. The proportion of the number of people who may be laid off is the opposite. According to preliminary statistics, private factories account for 75 percent of the total number of layoffs. The funds paid by state-owned factories will mostly be used for unemployed workers in private factories, which shows the class friendship between workers. At the same time, the relief fund collected by the government is far from enough to meet the needs of unemployed workers. This year, the municipal government plans to subsidize this expenditure with more than 2 million catties of millet. The relationship between public and private sectors reflected in this figure fully demonstrates that the government is making great efforts to help various factories solve the difficulties in developing production. Then, Deputy Director Wan answered the following questions raised by representatives of various industry associations in the implementation: First, regarding the scope of implementation, all factories and workshops employing more than 10 people are included. Assistant managers are not counted because they are capitalists or representatives of capitalists. As for shop assistants in a business unit, they should be treated the same as ordinary workers. Apprentices are part of the workers and are also included. If the apprentices themselves have very little wages and cannot pay the relief fund, it can be treated as an individual problem and handled appropriately by the Labor Bureau. Second, regarding the actual wage issue, since the current wage payment methods in various industries are not yet unified, the items cannot be mechanically stipulated and must be based on the specific circumstances of wage payments in each factory and workshop, including various actual incomes. For example, the food expenses provided by the factory should be included. Third, regarding the issue of union members and non-members, this relief measure is a government decree, and regardless of whether the workers are union members, they are all eligible for relief; of course, there should be no difference when paying the relief fund. Finally, Deputy Director Wan called on the heads of various trade associations to earnestly and quickly convey the spirit of this method and implement government decrees well in order to promote the development of the capital's production undertakings.

　　京召集私营厂商座谈会
    讨论救济失业员工细则
    【北京讯】北京市工商联合会筹委会于四日召集一百多私营工厂负责人举行座谈会，讨论市府颁布的救济失业员工试行细则的执行问题。自市府颁布该试行细则后，已缴纳二月份救济基金的至今仅有一百多户。私营行业中，地毯、针织等二十二行业还未开始。座谈会上首先由各厂负责人提出执行中发生的问题，然后由劳动局副局长万一分别予以解答。他说明这个法令是经过第二届第一次北京市各界人民代表会议通过，政府一再慎重考虑而制定的。颁布以后，在私营工厂中大部分厂方和工人都能认清这是从有利于发展生产出发，使工厂作坊获得合理改善经营，并适当保障工人生活。但有个别的厂方认识还不够正确，把缴纳救济基金看成是负担，甚至看成这笔钱是政府一部分财政收入。实际上从缴纳数字上看，公营工厂占总数的百分之七十六，私营工厂仅占百分之二十四。而可能解雇的人数则比例相反，据初步统计，私营工厂要占解雇总数的百分之七十五。公营工厂所缴纳的基金将多数用于私营工厂失业员工，这说明工人之间的阶级友爱。同时，政府所收来的救济基金远不足以解决失业员工的需要。市府今年概算中要以二百多万斤小米来补助这笔开支。从这数字中所表现的公私关系，充分说明了政府是以大力帮助各工厂解决发展生产中的困难的。接着万副局长就各业公会代表在执行当中所遇到的问题，作如下的解答：第一、关于执行范围，凡雇佣十人以上的工厂、作坊均包括在内。经副理因是资方或资方代表，故不计算在内。至于一个企业单位内的店员，则应同一般工人同等看待。学徒是工人的一部分，也包括在内，其中学徒本人工资很少，无法缴纳救济金的，可做为个别问题，由劳动局适当处理。第二、关于实际工资问题，由于目前各业工资支付形式还不统一，不能机械规定项目，须按各工厂、作坊支付工资的具体情况，包括各项实际收入。例如厂方供给的伙食费等即应包括在内。第三、关于工会会员与非会员问题，这一救济办法是政府的法令，不管工人是否工会会员，均在被救济之列；缴纳救济基金时，当然也不应有差别。最后万副局长号召各同业公会负责人认真、迅速传达这个办法的精神，很好地执行政府法令，以利首都生产事业的发展。
