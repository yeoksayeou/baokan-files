Ministry of Finance Notifies North China Provinces and Cities to Stop Using Local Grain Coupons

[Our Newspaper] To facilitate the central government's control over grain storage in North China and to overcome the chaotic situation in public grain payment, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government has issued a notice to provinces and cities directly under the central government, deciding to abolish local grain coupons. The notice stipulates that the local grain coupons issued by the provinces directly under the central government in the past will be discontinued from April 1 of this year and will be recalled within a limited time. After the local grain coupons are discontinued, the food expenses for government agencies and organizations at all levels and their staff working in the countryside will be paid in full. If there is a difference due to the different grain prices in various places, the original agency will be responsible for resolving it. For preferential treatment grain for military dependents, pensions grain, infant care grain, and those who must use grain coupons, the provinces should prepare a budget and submit it to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for approval, and the central grain coupons should be issued uniformly for exchange at the grain depot.

　　财政部通知华北各省市
    停止使用地方粮票
    【本报讯】中央人民政府财政部为了便利中央掌握华北各地粮库存粮情况，克服公粮支付上的紊乱现象，特向中央直辖各省市发出通知，决定废止地方粮票。通知内规定：过去中央直辖各省发行之地方粮票，自本年四月一日起，一律停止使用，并限期收回。地方粮票停使后，各级政府机关、团体下乡工作人员伙食，改为全部发款，其因各地粮价不一，发生折差时，由原机关负责解决。至优待军属粮、抚恤粮、婴儿保育粮、必须使用粮票者，由省造报预算送中央人民政府财政部核定，统一发给中央粮票向粮库兑取。
