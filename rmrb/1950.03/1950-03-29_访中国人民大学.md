Visiting Renmin University of China
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

　　In the spring of 1950, at Renmin University of China, the first new-type regular university established in the new China's capital, more than half of the 1,600 students were revolutionary cadres and advanced workers. This is one of the profound changes in social relations that occurred in China after the change of power – the working people will be gradually trained to become new-type intellectuals, entering the field of highly developed cultural and scientific knowledge, and becoming the backbone of the new China's construction.

　　In the past, there were also many workers and peasants who, after training and cultivation in the revolutionary ranks, possessed a considerable level of education. But only today, when the working people have completely grasped political power, is it possible for the People's Government to cultivate intellectuals from among the workers and peasants on such a large scale.

　　In the old society, the working people had no opportunity to receive school education. Li Fenglian, a student in the Factory Management Department of Renmin University of China – a labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and an executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, was the daughter of a farmhand in Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province. Her father worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord from the age of eight, but he still couldn't support his wife and children. Li Fenglian's mother starved to death. Li Fenglian was sold to a landlord's family as a child bride at the age of twelve. How could she even think about going to school and getting an education! Now, Li Fenglian is sitting in the classroom of Renmin University of China, talking to the reporter about her experiences and her urgent desire to learn cultural and scientific knowledge. She pointed to the scar on her cheek where her mother-in-law hit her with a broken bowl, her right palm where the bone was broken, and the nail on her right middle finger that had rotted off and grown back. These are the marks left on her body by the old society. She said with emotion: "The old society left me with a body full of injuries, but I recovered quickly in the revolutionary ranks. The old society made me an illiterate, which really harmed me!" From the day she joined the revolution, Li Fenglian had a strong desire to learn culture. When she was fifteen, she was once assigned to manage the food for thirty people. When she went to the street to buy vegetables, she didn't know the way and couldn't keep track of the accounts, so she had to wrap a piece of vegetable leaf in a piece of paper and make dozens of marks for the vegetable account, and wrap a pinch of salt in a piece of paper and make dozens of marks for the salt account. Li Fenglian sighed and said, "At that time, I realized that the suffering of the poor in the old society also had this aspect!" Like Li Fenglian, there are many similar examples among the hundreds of worker-peasant cadres and workers at Renmin University of China who were deprived of the right to study from an early age simply because they were the children of poor peasants and workers. But like Li Fenglian, after joining the revolution and under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party, they overcame all difficulties to learn basic cultural knowledge, and were admitted to the first People's University of the new China, happily enjoying the right to higher education and studying specialized knowledge.

　　This right was won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China through tenacious and unyielding struggle. They, these students who are now studying at Renmin University – nearly three hundred cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than eight years, and nearly five hundred cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years – have also participated in these battles. Yu Baohe, of the Department of Diplomacy, has fourteen years of Party membership and eighteen years of work experience, and persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle and the People's Liberation War in the Northeast for seventeen years, until the entire Northeast was liberated. Li Rongchun, also of the Department of Diplomacy, joined the Red Army at the age of fourteen and participated in the Long March, passing through snowy mountains and grasslands, and participated in the construction work of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the first anti-Japanese democratic base area, and grew up with the expansion of the Red Army. Li Fenglian and Li Caihai, of the Factory Management Department, used the working class's heroic and selfless labor to manufacture hand grenades and military uniforms in the rear of the base area under extremely difficult material conditions to supply the front line. Feng Jinzhang, also of the Factory Management Department, has thirteen years of Party membership and fifteen years of work experience, and led urban workers in struggles in the enemy-occupied areas and was imprisoned and forced to do hard labor… These people, in order to pave the way for the working people to embark on a happy life, have fought with astonishing hardship in the past ten or twenty years; now, with the arrival of the period of peaceful construction, in order to better shoulder the task of national production and construction, they are learning new skills.

　　They said: "We want to learn, only to work better." This simple sentence fully demonstrates the noble qualities of the working people. They never take credit for themselves and are never satisfied with past achievements. Yu Baohe, whose face was pale due to long-term arduous combat, said: "Chairman Mao told us: 'Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle', so we must intensify our study of new things in order to continue to serve the people effectively." Feng Jinzhang is the director of the No. 1 Printing Factory in Shanghai. He said that modern enterprise management and complex cost accounting are completely different from what he was familiar with in the mountains in the past, and now he "must start from scratch." This is the conclusion he has drawn for himself. Li Fenglian participated in the Chinese people's delegation to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. In the Soviet Union, she saw and heard many extremely important experiences and methods of production and construction, but she could not record them all. She further realized that the limitation of her cultural level affected her contribution to the Party and the people. "We must study," this is also her conclusion. She said, "After studying factory management for two years, I will know a lot about production management. Even if I become a female worker in the future, I will be able to make suggestions to the leadership on improving work." Although their current cultural level is still relatively low, we have every reason to believe that these heroes who have overturned the feudal mountain of old China for thousands of years and eradicated Chiang Kai-shek's twenty-two years of dictatorial rule will make miracles and heroic deeds in their studies as they did in the revolutionary war, when they are determined to complete their studies as a political task of combat. We have every reason to believe that the first batch of worker-peasant intellectuals cultivated in the new China, after they have mastered cultural and scientific knowledge, will play a more active backbone role in the construction of the new China.

　　访中国人民大学
    本报记者  金凤
    一九五○年春，在新中国首都创立的第一个新型正规大学——中国人民大学，入学的一千六百多学生中，革命干部和先进工人占二分之一以上。这是中国社会关系在政权改变后所发生的深刻变化之一——劳动人民将被逐步培养成为新型知识分子，进入高度发达的文化科学知识的领域，成为新中国建设中的骨干。
    在过去，也有过不少的工农劳动人民，经过革命队伍中的锻炼和培养，具有了相当的文化水平。但只有到了今天，劳动人民已完全掌握了政权，人民政府才有可能这样大规模地来培养工农劳动人民的知识分子。
    在旧社会里，劳动人民是没有机会受到学校教育的。中国人民大学工厂管理系学员李凤莲——陕甘宁边区的劳动英雄，中华全国总工会和中华全国民主妇联的执行委员，过去的陕西靖边县的一家雇农的女儿。她父亲打八岁起就给地主扛长活，到头来还养不活自己的老婆和孩子。李凤莲她娘活活饿死了，李凤莲十二岁上就被卖到地主家里当童养媳，那里还说得上进学校受教育！现在，李凤莲却坐在中国人民大学的课室里，对记者谈着她的经历和迫切要求学习文化科学知识的愿望。她指着颊上被她婆婆用破碗劈打的疤痕，她的被打断了骨的右手掌，她的烂掉了又重新长出来的右手中指甲，这些是旧社会印在她身上的一块块烙痕，她感慨地说：“旧社会留给我一身的伤，到了革命队伍中倒是很快地养好了，而旧社会让我当了个睁眼瞎子可着实坑害了我！”李凤莲从参加革命的那一天起，就有着学习文化的强烈要求。她在十五岁的时候，有一次被分派着管理三十几个人的伙食，她上街去买菜时，不认得路又记不上帐，她就只得用一张纸包上一片菜叶划上几十道道做菜帐，一张纸包上一撮盐划上几十道道做盐帐。李凤莲叹息着说：“那时候，我才认识到穷人在旧社会里吃的苦头还有这一面！”和李凤莲一样，仅只因为是贫雇农和工人的孩子，因此从小就被剥夺了念书的权利的，在中国人民大学的几百个工农干部和工人中，正有着不少同样的例子。但他们也都和李凤莲一样，在参加了革命以后，在共产党的教育培养下，毕竟克服了一切困难学习了初步的文化知识，考进了新中国第一所人民大学，幸福地享受着高等教育、学习专门知识的权利。
    这权利，是中国人民在中国共产党领导下，经过顽强不屈的战斗争取来的。他们，这些今日进入人民大学学习的一部分学生——将近三百的参加革命工作八年以上的干部，和将近五百的参加革命工作三年以上的干部，也都是参加了这些战斗的。外交系的于保合，有着十四年的党龄和十八年的工作历史，曾经在东北坚持抗日斗争和人民解放战争十七年，直到东北全境解放。也是外交系的李荣春，十四岁参加红军长征，经过雪山草地，参加了首席抗日民主根据地陕甘宁边区的建设工作，随着红军的壮大而长大起来。工厂管理系的李凤莲和李才海，曾以工人阶级英勇忘我的劳动，在物质条件十分困难的情况下，在根据地后方制造着手榴弹和军服供应前线军需。也是工厂管理系的冯锦璋，有着十三年的党龄和十五年的工作历史，在敌占区领导着城市工人进行斗争，被关在牢里做过苦役……。这些人，为着铺平劳动人民走上幸福生活的道路，在过去的十年、二十年中曾以惊人的艰苦战斗着；现在，随着和平建设时期的到来，为了更好的担负国家的生产建设工作，他们又在学习新的本领。
    他们说：“我们要学习，只是为了更好地工作。”这样一句朴素的语言，充分表现了劳动人民高贵的品质。他们绝不居功，绝不满足于过去的成就。那因长期艰苦的作战而显得面色苍白的于保合说：“毛主席告诉过我们：‘我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了’，因此我们必须要加紧学习新的事物，才能使自己继续有效地为人民服务。”冯锦璋是上海印制厂一厂厂长，他说近代化的企业管理、复杂的成本计算，已完全不是他过去在山沟里所熟悉的那一套，现在“必须从头学起”。这是他对自己所下的结论。李凤莲参加了中国人民庆祝苏联十月革命纪念节的代表团，在苏联，看到和听到许多极其重要的生产建设的经验和方法，但是无法一一记下来，她更进一步地认识到由于文化水平的限制，影响到自己对党对人民的贡献。“必须学习”，这也是她的结论。她说：“学了两年工厂管理，知道了许多管理生产的知识，就是将来当一个女工，向领导上提个改进工作的意见也在行”。尽管他们现在的文化水平还比较低，但在他们决心以学习当做战斗的政治任务来完成时，我们有十分的理由相信这些曾经扳倒了旧中国几千年来的封建大山，铲除了蒋介石二十二年的独裁统治的英雄们，他们会在学习上做出他们在革命战争时的奇迹和英雄行为。我们有十分的理由相信，新中国培养的第一批的工农知识分子，他们掌握了文化科学知识后，将在新中国的建设事业中起着更积极的骨干作用。
