People's Bank of Xingtai Office
    Supports Oil Mills to Help Plant Cotton
    [This newspaper reports] The People's Bank of Xingtai Office is vigorously supporting the production of the oil mill industry, concentrating a large amount of oil cake to help farmers with spring plowing, and has formulated a six-month work plan. In order to increase agricultural fertilizer, the office provided loans to the oil industry. In the past three months, it has supported 725 oil mills, accounting for 41.5% of the total number of oil mills in the area. The method adopted is to provide loans in kind and order goods, and borrowers repay oil cake on schedule. At present, various counties have concentrated oil cake, totaling more than 11 million jin of various oil cakes, exceeding the original plan by more than 1.8 million jin. In order to accelerate the turnover of national funds and absorb idle funds from the masses into production, it has been decided to supply fertilizer directly to farmers who really lack fertilizer in three ways: selling, lending, and bartering. In addition to deciding to lend out more than 7,058,000 jin in kind, the rest will be sold during the spring cotton planting and fertilization season in order to meet the seasonal fertilizer needs and play a role in stabilizing cake prices.
    In addition, the provincial branch allocated 540,000 jin of millet to the area for well drilling. After research, arrangements have been made. Xingtai, Nangong, and other eleven counties plan to build and repair 4,460 new and old wells in combination with private capital. The actual loan for each new well shall not exceed one-third of the total cost. The county agricultural science water conservancy group and the bank will jointly be responsible for preparing well-drilling materials, completing this task before wheat harvesting, and organizing distribution and inspection in a timely manner. The provincial bank also allocated 215,800 jin of millet to the area to increase and repair agricultural tools. According to the degree of agricultural tool shortage in various places, it will focus on supporting agricultural tool manufacturers (such as blacksmiths, iron and wood factories) to actively produce, and then lend the products to farmers. However, the agricultural tools must be guaranteed to meet the requirements of the masses: strong, durable, and inexpensive. Since the number of draught animals in the area is insufficient and the source is difficult, it has been decided that after the fertilizer loan work is completed, each sub-branch will withdraw possible funds to lend to counties, districts, villages, and private livestock dealers who transport livestock, and go to livestock-producing areas to transport back livestock and lend them to farmers who lack draught animals. The district plans to transport back 2,210 draught animals in the first half of the year, and 1,149 draught animals will be transferred to farmers after being transported and loaned.

　　人民银行邢台办事处
    扶植油坊帮助植棉
    【本报讯】人民银行邢台办事处，大力扶植油坊业生产，集中大量油饼，帮助农民春耕，并订出半年工作计划。该处为增加农业用肥料，贷款给油业，三个月来共扶持油坊七百二十五座，占该地总油坊数的百分之四十一点五。方式上采取折实贷款订货办法，贷户按期偿还油饼。日前各县已将油饼分别集中，共有各种油饼一千一百余万斤，超出原计划一百八十万余斤。为加速国家资金周转，及吸收群众游资投入生产起见，确定以卖、贷、换三种方式把肥料直接供给真正缺肥的农民。除决定以七百零五万八千余斤采用贷实折实方式贷出外，其余均留在春季植棉施肥季节售出，以便适应季节性的肥料需要，并可起平抑饼价的作用。
    又省分行拨给该区打井的资金计小米五十四万斤，经研究后，已作布置。邢台、南宫等十一县，计划结合私资打修新、旧井四千四百六十眼，每眼新井贷实不得超过全部费用三分之一。由县农业科水利组及银行共同负责准备打井物资，在麦前完成此项任务，并及时组织发放与检查。省行还拨与该区增修农具资金小米二十一万五千八百斤，按各地农具缺乏程度有重点地扶持农具制造者（如铁匠炉、铁木工厂），使其积极生产，再将产品贷给农民。但农具须保证合乎群众要求：坚实、耐用、价廉。由于该区耕畜数量不够，来源亦困难，故确定在贷肥工作完成后，各支行抽出可能运用的资金贷给贩运牲口的县、区、村社或私人牲口贩，到产畜地区去贩回牲口，贷给缺少耕畜的农户使用。全区上半年计划贩回耕畜二千二百一十头，经过贩运转贷给农户的耕畜有一千一百四十九头。（邵艺武、丁太然）
