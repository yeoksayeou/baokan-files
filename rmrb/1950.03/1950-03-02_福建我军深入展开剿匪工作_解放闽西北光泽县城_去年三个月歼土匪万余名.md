Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th: The bandit suppression troops in Fujian liberated Guangze County Town in northwestern Fujian on the morning of the 17th, killing and capturing more than 60 bandits including bandit battalion commanders.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th: After the complete liberation of the Fujian mainland, the various units of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Military Region actively launched the work of suppressing bandits. In the three months of September, October, and November last year, a total of more than 10,300 bandits were eliminated in the entire region, and a large number of various weapons were seized. At present, the struggle to suppress bandits in the area is continuing to deepen. The organized bandits in Fujian Province were a reactionary armed force that the Kuomintang bandit gang planned to leave behind before its destruction. These reactionary armed forces colluded with local habitual bandits and feudal forces, roaming in organized groups and harming the people. According to estimates at the time, there were more than 130 large and small bandit gangs throughout the province, with more than 40,000 bandits; some bandit gangs even controlled a few county towns such as Yong'an and Sanyuan in western Fujian (which have now been recovered by our army), continuing their reactionary rule. After the complete liberation of the Fujian mainland, our army immediately vigorously launched the work of suppressing bandits. In the early stage of the suppression campaign, due to the purely military viewpoint of some troops and the neglect of political disintegration and mobilizing the masses, the results of suppressing bandits were not significant. It was not until this deviation was gradually corrected in November last year that the work of suppressing bandits in the entire region began to make significant progress. For example, the number of bandits eliminated by the Second Military Sub-district (Nanping area) in November last year exceeded more than twice the total number of bandits eliminated in September and October. Under our powerful political offensive, Wan Huayu, the bandit county magistrate of Shaowu and Xu Shi, as well as Huang Qin'an and Xu Dong, the bandit leaders in the Keyang mountainous area, surrendered with their troops and weapons one after another. At present, most of the bandits in Yongtai and Minqing in eastern Fujian have been eliminated, and the people's power has been rapidly established; the navigation of the Minjiang River, which was once harassed by bandits, has also been unimpeded. Farmers in some areas of Jian'ou, with the assistance of the local government, have organized anti-bandit armed forces. A certain corps of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fujian, in order to further eliminate bandits, mobilize the masses, and establish local revolutionary order, has decided to organize working teams of 3,000 cadres above the squad level from its subordinate units before the end of February this year to go deep into the countryside to carry out work; and to use a part of the field army as the backbone for building local armed forces.

　　福建我军深入展开剿匪工作
    解放闽西北光泽县城   
    去年三个月歼土匪万余名
    【新华社福州二十六日电】福建剿匪部队十七日晨解放闽西北之光泽县城，毙俘匪大队长以下六十余名。
    【新华社福州二十四日电】人民解放军福建军区各部队于福建大陆全部解放后，积极展开清剿土匪工作。去年九、十、十一三个月中全区共歼匪一万零三百余名，缴获各种武器甚多。现该区剿匪斗争正继续深入开展。福建省的成股土匪，是国民党匪帮在覆灭前有计划留下的一部反动武装，这些反动武装和当地惯匪、封建势力相勾结，成股流窜，为害人民。据当时估计，全境大小股匪达一百三十余起，拥有匪众四万多人；部分股匪并控制了闽西永安、三元等少数县城（现已为我军收复）继续其反动统治。我军于福建大陆全部解放后，当即大力开展清剿土匪工作，在进剿初期由于部分部队存在着单纯的军事观点，忽视了政治瓦解和发动群众的工作，因而剿匪成绩不大。直到去年十一月此种偏向逐步纠正后，全区剿匪工作始有显著进展。如第二军分区（南平地区）去年十一月份歼匪人数即超过九、十月份歼匪总数两倍以上，而在我强大的政治攻势下，邵武等县匪县长万华屿、许士及柯洋山区匪首黄勤安、徐东等均相继率部携械投降。现闽东永泰、闽清一带股匪大部肃清，人民政权已迅速建立；一度被匪滋扰之闽江航运亦已畅通无阻。建瓯部分地区农民并在当地政府协助下，纷纷组织了防匪武装。现驻福建之人民解放军某兵团为进一步肃清土匪、发动群众、建立地方革命秩序，已决定于本年二月底前由所属各部队中抽调班以上干部三千人组织工作队，深入农村展开工作；并以一部野战部队作为建设地方武装的骨干。
