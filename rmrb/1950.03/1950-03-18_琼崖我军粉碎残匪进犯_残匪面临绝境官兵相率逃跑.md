Xinhua News Agency, Qiongyai, 17th—The entire army and people of the Qiongyai Liberated Area have basically crushed the large-scale incursion launched by the Qiongyai Kuomintang remnant bandits since January. In early January, the remnant bandits began to invade the border areas of Baisha, Ledong, and Baoning in the Qiongyai Liberated Area, as well as the liberated areas of Danxian, Lingao, Chengmai, and Xinmin counties in western Qiong. The 59th Division and 268th Division of the Fourth Army, and parts or most of the 152nd Division and 321st Division of the 63rd Army, and all of the Riot Police Regiment, gathered at the bandit strongholds in southern Qiong and launched an attack on Baisha and Ledong on January 15, and even penetrated into the territory of Baoning County. However, under the successive resistance of the army and people in the liberated area, the bandits who invaded Ledong County did not dare to advance further when they reached Qiongyaipo, south of Ledong City, and finally fled back in panic on the 24th. The bandit troops who infiltrated Baoning County suffered more than a hundred casualties and many scattered under the continuous counterattacks of the People's Liberation Army and local militia in coordination. A certain village militia captured seven bandit soldiers alive. The bandit troops who invaded the area have been severely hit and fled in a panic on the 12th of this month.

In western Qiong, the remnant bandits of the 64th Army, gathered in strongholds such as Heshe, Daxing, and Luoji, launched fierce attacks on the front line of Mupaishi, Meizhuishan, and Guangcun Township on the border between Danxian and Lingao in January and February. The Qiongxi People's Liberation Army and local armed forces killed and wounded more than 80 bandit soldiers in the Sixing Village area of Mupaishi, and killed and wounded more than 40 bandit soldiers near Sucun. The 151st Division of the 62nd Army and parts of the 2nd Security Division, in order to cooperate with the bandit troops in Dan and Lin, began to infiltrate Leidong Township in Qiongcheng County and Jiaxundong in Xinmin County. Our army killed and wounded more than 20 remnant bandits of the 151st Division in the resistance. The two battalions of the 2nd Security Division that invaded Leidong Township were also intercepted and attacked by our local armed forces. The bandit army retreated after suffering heavy casualties. Another group of bandit troops who infiltrated Jiaxundong were also forced to flee back towards Xinxing City under the tenacious attacks of our militia.

Xinhua News Agency, Qiongyai, 17th—Facing a desperate situation, the remaining bandit troops in Qiongyai are engaged in internal strife, with officers and soldiers fleeing one after another, completely in a state of panic. Recently, Zhao Lin, the commander of the 32nd Bandit Army, has been dismissed by the bandit leader Xue Yue for "negligence of defense"; the Bandit Teaching Division has been "ordered to disband" due to internal instability; and more than a dozen officers below the division commander have also been arrested and imprisoned for "colluding with the enemy" due to internal strife. The pessimistic and war-weary sentiment caused by the desperate situation in the bandit army has spread from the lower levels to the upper levels. Lao Zhixiong, the commander of the 175th Regiment of the 90th Division of the Fourth Bandit Army, resigned due to "pessimism" about the "situation" and feigned illness; the deputy commander of the 286th Bandit Division has also abandoned his post and fled. The flight of lower-level officers and soldiers in the bandit army is also increasing day by day. Since the 20th Provisional Division of the bandits fled to Qiongyai from the mainland, desertions have been occurring every day. Recently, 452 of the 769 members of the 59th Regiment of the division have deserted. Since the Lin Mang troops of the Fourth Bandit Column fled to Qiong from the Guinan area, 519 people have fled one after another before and after the reorganization, including 74 lieutenant-level officers.

　　琼崖我军粉碎残匪进犯
    残匪面临绝境官兵相率逃跑
    【新华社琼崖十七日电】琼崖解放区全体军民已经基本上粉碎了琼崖国民党残匪一月份以来的大规模进犯。一月初旬，残匪开始向琼崖解放区白沙、乐东、保宁的边沿地带及琼西方面的儋县、临高、澄迈、新民等县解放区进犯。集结在琼南方面匪据点的第四军五十九师、二六八师，六十三军一五二师、三二一师各一部或大部日税警总团全部于一月十五、扑犯白沙、乐东，且一度深入我保宁县境。但在解放区军民节节阻击下，犯乐东县境之匪于侵至距乐东城南部到琼崖坡时，即不敢继续前进一步，终于二十四日仓皇回窜。向保宁窜扰之匪军在人民解放军与当地民兵配合连续予以反击下，伤亡百余名，溃散者甚多。某村民兵即生俘匪军七名。向该地进犯匪军连续遭受严重打击后已于本月十二日狼狈撤逃。
    琼西方面，集结于和舍、大兴、洛基等据点之残匪六十四军一、二月间向我儋县、临高边境之木排市、美赘山、光村乡一线猛犯，琼西人民解放军和地方武装，于木排市四行村一带毙伤匪军八十余名，并在苏村附近毙伤匪军四十余名。匪六十二军一五一师及保二师各一部，为配合儋、临方面之匪军行动，开始向我琼澄县之雷东乡及新民县之加训洞一带窜扰。我军在阻击中毙伤匪一五一师残部二十余名。进犯雷东乡之匪保二师二个营，亦遭我地方武装阻截打击。匪军在死伤甚众后撤退。窜犯加训洞之另部匪军，在我民兵顽强进击下，亦被迫向新兴市方面回窜。
    【新华社琼崖十七日电】面临绝境的琼崖残余匪军，内部互相倾轧，官兵相率逃亡，完全处于皇皇不可终日的情况中。最近，匪卅二军军长赵琳已为匪首薛岳以“疏忽防务”的罪名撤职；匪教导师已因内部不稳“奉命解散”；另有师长以下十余名军官亦因内部倾轧被为“勾结敌人”而被捕下狱。匪军中由于面临绝境所造成的悲观厌战情绪，已由下层蔓延到上层。匪第四军九十师一七五团团长劳治兄，因对“时局”表示“悲观”而装病辞职；匪二八六师副师长，亦已弃职潜逃。匪军下层官兵相率逃亡也日甚一日，匪暂二十师自大陆逃抵琼崖以后，每日不断发生逃亡现象，最近该师五十九团全团七百六十九人中，就有四百五十二人逃亡；自桂南区逃命来琼的匪第四纵队林芒部，于改编前后就相继逃跑了五百一十九名，内尉级军官有七十四名。
