A summary of TASS reports: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party passed a resolution on "March 8th" International Women's Day. The resolution expresses deep conviction that Polish women will continue to increase their achievements and consciously participate in Poland's socialist construction, fighting alongside the working class and all the Polish people for Poland's prosperity and lasting peace. Polish women now have broad opportunities to participate in all aspects of the country's social, economic and cultural life. The resolution also states that the number of women working in industry is two and a half times that of pre-war. Seven thousand five hundred women have been promoted to team leaders, foremen, workshop managers and enterprise managers. The number of female union members has reached 1.2 million, and more than 22,000 women have been elected to the leading bodies of the unions.

The Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party sent a letter to the Hungarian Democratic Women's League on the eve of March 8th, thanking Hungarian women for their assistance in national reconstruction, the implementation of the Three-Year National Economic Plan, and the construction of socialism. It also called on women to participate more actively in political activities and production work.

At the women's conference in the "Vlafka" factory in Krosz, the 35,350 participating working women unanimously expressed their determination to over-fulfill the 1950 economic plan to fight for peace. By the end of last year, the number of women engaged in industry in Romania was 230,000, compared with 183,000 in 1948. Women are also actively participating in the country's political and social life. Two women are ministers, 31 are members of the National Assembly, three are advisors to ministries, one is the president of a specialist college, and 27 are university professors. Approximately 40,000 women hold important positions in trade union organizations, approximately 7,500 women are people's jurors, and more than 6,000 women participate in the management of cooperative societies.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th. A summary of TASS reports: Women in Germany and Austria are enthusiastically preparing to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day.

In Germany, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party issued an appeal to all women in the German Democratic Republic, pointing out that the constitution of the German Democratic Republic has ensured equal rights for women and men. Women are now working with all patriotic forces of the German people to vigorously oppose the division of Germany, oppose the enslavement of West Germany, oppose the establishment of mercenary armies in West Germany to serve Anglo-American imperialism, and vigorously strive to establish a unified, democratic, peace-loving and independent Germany. The proclamation calls on women to "actively participate in the struggle waged by the National Front of Democratic Germany."

The Austrian Democratic Women's League issued a call stating that on this year's International Women's Day, Austrian women will express their determination to fight for peace, for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria, for Austria's complete independence, against any military blocs, against the construction of military bases in our country, and against the organization of new armies. The proclamation calls on all Austrian women to consolidate the ranks of peace advocates and actively participate in the commemoration of March 8th, striving for peace, happiness and freedom.
