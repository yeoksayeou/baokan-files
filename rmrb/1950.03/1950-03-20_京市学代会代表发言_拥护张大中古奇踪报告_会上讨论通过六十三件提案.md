　　Beijing Student Congress Representatives Speak
    Endorsing Zhang Dazhong and Gu Qizong's Remarkable Achievements Report
    Sixty-Three Proposals Discussed and Passed at the Meeting
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the representatives of the Second Beijing Student Congress discussed the reports of Zhang Dazhong and Gu Qizong on the evening of the 18th and the morning of yesterday (the 19th) (for the main points of the reports, see another article), they held a general meeting for speeches at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The representatives unanimously agreed with the two reports and expressed their willingness to bring the guidelines and methods proposed in the reports back to their schools for implementation.

    Regarding the issue of studying core subjects well: The representative of the Seventh Group said: During the discussion, it was clarified that all courses prescribed by the school are core subjects; however, in learning, for courses that cannot be fundamentally reformed in time, a critical attitude should be adopted. Many middle school representatives believed that one of the reasons why students felt overburdened in the past was the lack of planning in their studies. The Eleventh Group suggested that the teaching and research departments of each school should study the weight of each course.

    Regarding the issue of unity between teachers and students: The meeting reflected the method of students at Peking University Medical College carefully providing feedback to professors after class, which improved teaching methods and strengthened the unity between teachers and students; however, some schools forced teachers to participate in morning exercises, group meetings, and other activities, which did not help learning.

    Regarding extracurricular production: Representatives generally believed that it was a good way to improve students' lives. The main problems at present are to consolidate students' enthusiasm for production, strengthen their labor perspective, and not be afraid of fatigue, dirt, or long distances. The Tsinghua representative guaranteed in his speech to do a good job in production in a planned and honest manner. Some private middle schools do not pay enough attention to extracurricular production administratively. The congress believed that students in these schools should strive for the administration to take the lead in assuming responsibility as soon as possible. The Third Group suggested that each school should pay attention to thrift while carrying out production. The representative of the Agricultural University said: This kind of work should be well organized and more technical skills should be learned from farmers.

    After the representatives spoke, the congress discussed the proposals. All sixty-three proposals submitted by the schools were approved or supplemented according to the review opinions. The congress also discussed the revision of the constitution.

    The agenda for today's congress is as follows: continue to discuss the constitution in the morning, typical reports, and elect the second executive committee. Announce the election results in the afternoon, the executive committee takes office, and the closing ceremony. In the evening, all members will participate in the World Youth Week evening party jointly organized by the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Municipal Student Federation.

　　京市学代会代表发言
    拥护张大中古奇踪报告
    会上讨论通过六十三件提案
    【本报讯】北京市学生第二届代表大会代表们经过十八日晚和昨（十九）日早晨分别讨论张大中和古奇踪的报告后（报告要点见另条），昨天上午十时举行大会发言。代表们对这两个报告一致表示同意，并愿把报告中所提出的方针和办法带回学校去贯彻实现。
    关于学好正课的问题：第七组代表说：在讨论中明确了所有学校规定的课程都是正课；但在学习中，对于还来不及根本改革的课程，则要采取批判的态度。许多中学代表认为过去同学感到负担太重的原因之一，是学习的计划性不够。第十一组则建议各校由教导处把各种课程的份量加以研究。
    关于师生团结问题：会上反映了北大医学院同学在课后慎重地给教授提意见的办法，改善了教学方法，加强了师生团结；有些学校的同学勉强要先生参加早操、小组会等活动，则对学习没有什么帮助。
    关于课余生产：代表们都认为是改善同学生活的很好的办法。目前主要问题是巩固同学生产情绪，加强劳动观点，不要怕累、怕脏、怕路远。清华代表在发言中保证有计划地、老老实实地搞好生产。有些私立中学，行政上对课余生产不够重视，大会认为这些学校的同学应该争取行政上赶快负起领导的责任。第三组建议各校进行生产的同时，要注意节约。农业大学的代表说：做这种工作要组织的好，要多向农民学习技术。
    代表发言后，大会进行提案讨论。各校所提六十三件提案，均分别依照审查意见通过或加以补充后通过。大会并讨论了会章修改问题。
    今日大会议程为：上午继续讨论会章，典型报告及选举第二届执委会。下午宣布选举结果，执委就职，闭幕式。晚上全体参加团市工委与市学联联合举办的纪念世界青年周晚会。
