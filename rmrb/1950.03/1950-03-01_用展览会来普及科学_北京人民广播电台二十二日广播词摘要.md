The Chinese people, oppressed by feudalism and imperialism in the past, were cut off from science. Only a small number of bureaucrats, landlords, and compradores could enjoy the fruits of science. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the viewpoints of the vast majority of scientific workers have changed. On the one hand, they demand progress for themselves, and on the other hand, they are willing to do things beneficial to the people, that is, willing to serve the people. Furthermore, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference defines "love of science" as one of the national virtues, which shows the importance the Central People's Government attaches to science. However, to make the people love science, we must first make them understand what science is. Moreover, in order to break superstition, establish a dialectical materialist worldview, improve health, and improve production technology, it is also necessary to popularize scientific knowledge to the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the work of popularizing science is extremely important at present.

How to carry out the work of popularizing science? Natural science is the knowledge of the struggle for production, and its research object is the things of nature. Therefore, science education cannot rely solely on writing, especially since many working people in China have not yet mastered the weapon of writing. Therefore, using concrete things to carry out the work of popularizing science can be said to be the most direct and effective method. Displaying physical objects for the audience to learn is something that socialist countries like the Soviet Union have always valued. Scientific institutions such as science museums, museums, and cultural palaces have permanently displayed many pictures, models, specimens, and objects for people to visit throughout the year. The establishment of these types of institutions requires considerable funding and several years of preparation to realize. In China, the science museums during the Kuomintang era were mostly simple and small in scale, existing in name only. As for museums, they were mostly limited to displaying historical relics, and we hardly had a museum of science and technology. In order to make up for these shortcomings, we can only use exhibitions, taking physical objects and performances to carry out the work of popularizing science education. Although this exhibition method is temporary, it can be adapted to the time and place and used flexibly. If it is arranged properly and promoted well, it will definitely attract a large number of viewers in a short period of time, and the educational effect obtained will not be small.

In the past six months, some large-scale exhibitions related to science have been held in various parts of the new China, such as the Dalian Industrial Exhibition in the autumn of last year, the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition in the winter, and the Shanghai Agricultural Exhibition in January of this year. They have all been supported by a large number of viewers and have played a good role in improving production enthusiasm and improving industrial and agricultural technologies. I believe that similar exhibitions will be held successively throughout the country.

Now let's talk about the Beijing Spring Festival Science Knowledge Exhibition currently on display. This is an exhibition organized by the Science Popularization Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture and held by more than 30 relevant scientific institutions, groups, and schools in Beijing. The location of the exhibition is in Changdian, outside Hepingmen in Beijing, and it borrows a large auditorium and ten classrooms of the Affiliated Middle School of Normal University as the venue.

During the preparation period, we sought opinions from various parties and decided that the content of this exhibition should be as practical as possible, acceptable to the general public, and serve the general public. Because Changdian is the cultural and entertainment center for Beijing citizens and farmers in the nearby suburbs during the Spring Festival and has a history of two or three hundred years, and many of those who visit Changdian are women, a large exhibition room was set up as the Women and Children's Health Group. In order to meet the needs of many people who are currently studying the history of social development, an "From Ape to Man" exhibition group was set up. Basic scientific knowledge such as physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and psychology are related to production and daily life, and there is also a need to take this opportunity to popularize it. Hence, there is a general science group. The design, drawing, manufacturing, assembly, arrangement, and overall coordination of the exhibits of each group are all presided over by a designated preparation unit. This is a rather heavy and intensive task, but all departments completed it as scheduled. It is impossible to accurately estimate how many people were mobilized during the preparation work before the exhibition. Roughly estimated, it was definitely no less than 500 people, and more than 1,000 people participated in the work during the exhibition period, which shows that this is a mass work. We express our gratitude for the support of these many scientific workers. Without their cooperation, this exhibition would not have been possible. At the same time, we can also suggest to other institutions preparing to organize exhibitions that mobilizing the masses is the only way.

Since the opening of the exhibition, the number of viewers has been over 7,000 every day, and many people are unable to enter the venue on the same day due to the limited capacity of the venue. On the one hand, we should apologize that the venue is too small; on the other hand, the public's eagerness to learn touches us. At the same time, it can also be seen that the exhibition is a very good weapon for popularizing science, and it is hoped that natural science workers who are enthusiastic across the country can make full use of it.

　　用展览会来普及科学
    ——北京人民广播电台二十二日广播词摘要
    袁翰青
    在封建主义和帝国主义压迫下的中国人民过去是与科学绝缘的；科学的成果只有少数官僚、地主、买办之类的人能享受。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，绝大部分的科学工作者的观点改变了，他们一方面自己要求进步，同时愿意做一些于人民有益的事，也就是愿意替人民服务。而人民政协的共同纲领把“爱科学”定为国民公德之一，这可见中央人民政府对于科学的重视。可是要使人民爱科学，必须先使人民懂得什么是科学；并且为了破除迷信，建立辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，增进健康，提高生产技术，也需要将科学知识普及到广大的人民。所以科学普及的工作在目前是十分重要的。
    怎样进行科学普及工作呢？自然科学是生产斗争的知识，它的研究对象是自然界的物。因此，科学教育是不能单靠文字的，何况目前中国还有很多劳动人民没有能掌握文字这一项武器；所以利用具体的物来进行科学普及工作可说是最直接而且最容易收效的方法。用实物陈列起来，供观众的学习，这在社会主义国家的苏联是一向重视的。长期陈列了许多图画、模型、标本、实物让人终年可以参观的就是科学馆、博物馆、文化宫之类的机构。这一类机构的建立需要相当多的经费和好几年的筹备方才能实现，而在我们中国，以前国民党时代的科学馆多是因陋就简，规模很小，徒有其名。至于博物馆多系限于陈列一些历史上的文物，我们几乎没有一所科学工艺方面的博物馆。为了弥补这些缺陷，我们只有用展览会的方式，拿实物和表演来进行普及科学教育的工作。这种展览会的方式虽是临时性的，但是能够因时因地制宜，灵活地运用；如果布置得当，宣传的好，一定能在短时期间吸引大批的观众，所得的教育效果是并不太小的。
    半年以来，在新中国的各地方曾举行了一些与科学有关的规模不小的展览会，如像去年秋季的大连工业展览会，冬季的天津工业展览会和本年一月间上海的农业展览会，都得到广大的观众的拥护，对于提高生产热情，改进工农技术，起了相当好的作用。我相信，和这些相类似的展览会在全国各地一定会陆续举办的。
    我们现在谈一谈目前正在展出的北京春节科学知识展览会，这是由中央文化部科学普及局组织了北京的三十多个有关的科学机关、团体和学校所举办的一个会。展览会的地点在北京市和平门外的厂甸，借用了师范大学附属中学的一个大礼堂和十个教室作为会场。
    在筹备期间，我们征求了多方面的意见，决定这个展览会的内容要尽量做到切合实际，能为一般人民大众所接受，为一般人民大众来服务。因为厂甸是北京市民以及近郊农民春节的文娱中心，已有两三百年的历史，而逛厂甸的很多是妇女，所以布置了一个大的陈列室，作为妇幼卫生组。又为了满足当前许多正在学习社会发展史的人的要求，设了一个“从猿到人”展览组。而基本科学知识为物理、化学、生物、地理、心理之类，很多与生产和日常生活有关，也有借这个机会来普及的必要，于是乎有一个一般科学组。各组展览品的设计、绘图、制造、装配、布置和整个的配合，都有推定的筹备单位来主持。这是一个相当繁重，突击性的任务，可是各部门都如期完成了。在展出之前的筹备工作究竟动员多少人无法确切的统计，大体的估计，决不在五百人以下，而展出期间参加工作的人员有一千多，可见这是一个群众性的工作。我们对于这许多科学工作者的支持，表示谢意。没有他们的合作，这次展览会是不可能的。同时，我们也可以向其他准备筹办展览会的机构建议，发动群众是唯一的办法。
    展览会开幕以来，每天观众都在七千人以上，还有许多人限于会场容量不能当天入场参观。一方面我们应当抱歉，场地太小了；另一方面群众求知心的恳切使我们感动。同时也可以看出，展览会这一种形式对于普及科学工作是一个很好的武器，希望各地热心的自然科学工作者都能充分地运用。
