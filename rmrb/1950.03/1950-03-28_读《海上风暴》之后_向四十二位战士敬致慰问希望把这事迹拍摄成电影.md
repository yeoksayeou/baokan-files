After Reading "Storm at Sea"
To the Forty-Two Warriors, We Extend Our Condolences, Hoping to Film This Deed

To the Editor:
    I was extremely excited when I saw "Storm at Sea" published in the People's Daily on March 16th. Every day I longed for the newspaper, and even when eating and sleeping I was thinking about our forty-two people's warriors. Sometimes the newspaper was late, and I was very anxious, as if something was terribly wrong. One day, two days passed! It was not yet finished, and I was constantly sweating, worried, and silently praying: May our dear warriors return safely! I didn't feel relieved and jump for joy until I finished reading it on March 20th. After reading this report, I have these feelings: ① Only our People's Liberation Army—Chairman Mao's troops—can display such heroic and tenacious spirit to overcome all difficulties and a spirit of great fearlessness. ② This report further demonstrates the determination of each of our commanders and fighters to hate the enemy with a common hatred, and their will to wipe out the remaining enemies. They do not avoid any hardship and take risks to actively prepare for the sea crossing operation to annihilate the remaining bandits. That is why they encountered this heroic deed of a storm at sea, which was almost an unexpected disaster and worthy of praise.
    Have Company Commander Gao Wenbin and his platoon of forty-two people's warriors recovered their health? I am constantly thinking about them, please convey my sincere condolences! And I hope you can tell us about their recent situation.

To the Editor:
    Recently, the People's Daily continuously published Comrade Jiao Fuchun's report "Storm at Sea." I was very moved after reading it. I feel that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarding the coast, especially Gao Wenbin, the company commander of the 9th Company of a certain regiment, and his forty-two brothers, truly endured all hardships and overcame difficulties with unparalleled tenacious spirit. In a very difficult environment, they were still full of unwavering belief in victory, fully demonstrating the essence of the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party. This spirit is worth learning by each of us. Now there are still a few cadres in our various organs and troops who are making trouble over enjoying treatment and other issues, which is not right. I suggest that this story be made into a movie or drama to educate the people and the army.

　　读《海上风暴》之后
    向四十二位战士敬致慰问希望把这事迹拍摄成电影编辑同志：
    当我看到三月十六日人民日报刊载的《海上风暴》以后，极为兴奋。每天渴望着报纸，甚至吃饭睡觉也在思念着我们的四十二个人民战士。有时报纸来的迟些，心中着急的很，惶惶不安得什么似的。一天两天的过去啦！还不见续完，天天捏着一把汗，提心吊胆着，时时默祷着：亲爱的战士们平安的归来吧！直到三月二十日把它读完，心中才如块石头落了地，喜欢的蹦跳。我看了这篇报告，有这样感觉：①只有我们人民解放军——毛主席的队伍，才会有这样英勇顽强战胜一切困难、大无畏精神表现。②由这个报告更可看出我们每个指战员同志们的敌忾同仇的决心，和誓灭残敌的意志。不避一切艰困，冒险犯难，为完成歼灭残匪而积极准备渡海作战的动作，所以才遭遇了这次险遭不测、可歌可泣的海上风暴的英勇事迹。
    现在高文宾连长这一排四十二个人民战士身体复原了吧？时在念中，请代为敬致慰问之忱！并希将他们的近况告诉我们。
    山西省行政干校秦达生编辑同志：
    最近人民日报连续发表矫福纯同志的报告《海上风暴》一文，我看了以后很受感动。我觉得守卫海防的人民解放军的战士们，特别是某团九连连长高文宾和全排四十二个弟兄们，他们真是以无比顽强的精神忍受一切艰苦克服困难。他们在十分艰苦的环境中，仍然充满着顽强胜利的信念，完全表现了共产党领导下人民解放军的本质。这种精神是值得我们每个人学习的。现在我们各机关和部队中还有少数干部，闹享受待遇等问题，是不应该的。我建议将此故事制成电影或戏剧，用他来教育人民，教育军队。
