Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th: According to a Dentsu News Agency dispatch from New York: Eichelberger, advisor on Far Eastern Affairs to the U.S. Army Department, declared in New York on the 3rd that the United States must allow Japan to remilitarize. He said: To remilitarize Japan is "America's moral responsibility." Eichelberger, who once served as commander of the U.S. Eighth Army stationed in Japan, is currently acting as MacArthur's spokesman in the United States. Whitney, head of the MacArthur Headquarters' Japanese Government Affairs Section, is already implementing the American plan to establish a Japanese police force of approximately 400,000 men. This police force is the core of a new Japanese army.
