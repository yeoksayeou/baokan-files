Under the protection and indulgence of MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the US occupation forces in Japan, the majority of Japanese war criminals have been at large from the beginning, not arrested or tried, and the war criminals who have been arrested or sentenced have also been released from prison one after another. One of the main purposes of MacArthur's measure is to use them as accomplices to the United States in helping the Kuomintang bandits slaughter the Chinese people.

As early as the second half of 1947, under the arrangement of the United States, Japanese war criminal Hideki Tojo, who had served as the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, and Ayukawa Gisuke, a military industry tycoon and former president of the Manchuria Heavy Industries Corporation, who had just been released from Sugamo Prison by MacArthur, disguised themselves as "special immigrants" and went to Taiwan on two ships to plan the construction of military bases in Taiwan and assist the United States in training Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. In March 1948, Song Ziwen, the former "Director of Pacification for Southern China" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, upon "introduction" by MacArthur, hired Japanese war criminal Horiuchi Kano, former minister to the Wang Jingwei puppet government, and Yamada Tadashi, another Japanese financial magnate, as consultants.

Okamura Yasuji, one of the important Japanese war criminals who invaded China and former commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army, served as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor after Japan's surrender, plotting the criminal war against the Chinese people. When the Kuomintang's bandit nest in Nanjing was in danger last January, MacArthur colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang, and the Kuomintang bandit gang came forward to declare Okamura Yasuji innocent and released him, sending him back to Japan. After Okamura was released and returned to Japan, under the direction of MacArthur, he recruited Japanese troops for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Cao Shicheng, the head of the first group in charge of military affairs of the Chiang Kai-shek's delegation in Japan, often sent personnel to contact Okamura and engage in recruiting Japanese to Taiwan to help Chiang Kai-shek's bandits fight. The Tokyo correspondent of the American Christian Science Monitor, based on materials from "Allied" and Chiang Kai-shek's senior military officers, also confirmed that Okamura Yasuji was one of the main figures planning to use Japanese troops to participate in the Chinese war.

In addition to Okamura Yasuji, many Japanese war criminals who were released by MacArthur and under his protection were engaged in recruiting so-called "Japanese volunteer soldiers," including General Neji Okamura, former commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Kodama Yoshio, former chief of the Japanese Navy's special agency in Shanghai, and Yokoyama Yuui, a well-known fascist member of the "Black Dragon Society." General Neji Okamura arrived in Taiwan as early as last July. According to a report in the Japanese magazine "Shinsō" on January 1st of this year: In the conspiracy to recruit soldiers for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, Okamura Yasuji, General Neji Okamura, and Tsuji Masanobu, a special agent who had worked in the Second Section of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army Headquarters, were responsible for the main organization work; Kodama Yoshio, fascist soldier Mikami Taku, Lieutenant General Sumida Harukata, former commander of the Japanese army in Shanxi, and Major General Yamaoka Michitake, chief of staff of his First Army, were responsible for recruiting soldiers; Kodama Yoshio, Navy Colonel Sakata Akimori, and Sakata Seisei were responsible for capital planning; Lieutenant General Sato Genichi (Chinese name "Zuo Xuanlong"), former head of the Kaifeng Special Agency, was responsible for purchasing weapons; and Uchiyama Kanzō and Yamada Junzaburō were responsible for lobbying, gathering, and contacting people in various parts of Japan. In addition, there were a large number of Japanese war criminals who "formed special relationships" with the Kuomintang remnants in the troop-recruiting conspiracy. In the former army system (all major general level) there was: Imai Takeo, chief of the general staff of the China dispatch army, Tanaka Ryukichi, Kawaki Yoshitaro, Maeda Masami, Watanabe Wataru, etc.; In the former special agent system there was: Okada Yoshimasa, Fuke Shunichi, Kawaguchi Tadatatsu, etc.; In the former intelligence system for China there was: Kitahara Tatsuo, Kusano Fumio, etc.; In the former diplomatic system there was: Miura Yoshiaki, Consul General in Hankou, Suma Yakichirō, Consul General in Nanjing, Tsuchida Yutaka, Minister to Beijing, Iwai Eiichi of the intelligence agency, etc. Shidehara Kijūrō, the current supreme advisor to Shigeru Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party, Ichirō Hatoyama, former president of the Seiyukai and president of the Liberal Party, the predecessor of the Democratic Liberal Party, Ken Inukai, former economic advisor to the Wang Jingwei puppet government, Fusanosuke Kuhara, former secretary-general of the Seiyukai and military industry tycoon, Shozo Murata, former ambassador to the Philippines and representative of the Sumitomo zaibatsu, and Yuui Yokoyama, a fascist, also participated in the conspiracy to recruit "Japanese volunteer soldiers." The magazine also pointed out that General Kazushige Ugaki, the former Governor-General of Korea and an active supporter of the war of aggression against China, was also involved in the troop-recruiting activities.

In order to recruit "Japanese volunteer soldiers," Wu Tiecheng, Chiang Kai-shek's "news advisor" Dong Xian Guang, and Chiang Kai-shek's "Supply Commander of the Southeast Military and Political Office" He Shili personally visited Japan one after another between August and December last year. Wu Tiecheng also met with MacArthur and Yokoyama Yuui. Now, even Japanese officials openly admit the crimes of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, and Japanese war criminals colluding with each other to fight against the Chinese people. According to a United Press report on November 12th last year, Japanese Prosecutor-General Toshikichi Ueda, in response to questioning by members of the House of Representatives, admitted that "some Japanese volunteers have actually gone to Taiwan to participate in the Kuomintang army."

Among the so-called "Japanese volunteer soldiers," many are Japanese air force personnel. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on September 12th last year quoted a "certain anonymous well-informed person" as saying: "Two hundred Japanese air force 'volunteers' have gathered in Taiwan, preparing to participate in the war against the CCP." The dispatch also revealed that Chiang Kai-shek had formulated a plan to recruit Japanese aviators to come to China to participate in the war when he was in Hangzhou in April last year, and later Chiang Kai-shek allocated 12 million US dollars as funds for the plan. Senior officials of the US occupation authorities also openly admitted that Japanese war criminals organized Japanese air force personnel to help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter the Chinese people. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on December 2nd last year stated: "A senior official of the occupation authorities said: The news that former senior army officers stationed in Taiwan are organizing a foreign air force unit of Japanese to fight for the Kuomintang is true." This news proves that the recent heinous crimes of US-made bandit planes frantically bombing our liberated areas and slaughtering peaceful residents were carried out with the direct participation of the "Japanese volunteer soldiers" supported by the US occupiers and organized by Japanese war criminals.

### 麦克阿瑟指使日本战犯  继续侵华的罪行

　　麦克阿瑟指使日本战犯  继续侵华的罪行
    在美国驻日占领军统帅麦克阿瑟的包庇纵容下，日本大多数战犯自始就逍遥法外，未遭逮捕审讯，而已被捕或判决的战犯，也陆续被释出狱了。麦克阿瑟这一措施的主要目的之一，在于要利用他们作为美国帮助国民党匪帮屠杀中国人民的帮凶。
    早在一九四七年下半年，在美国的布置下，日本侵华要犯、曾任日本驻台湾总督的长谷川清，就和刚被麦克阿瑟从巢鸭监狱释放出来的军需财阀、前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介等人，即曾伪装“特别移民”，分乘两船前往台湾，策划建筑台湾的军事基地，并协助美国训练蒋匪军队。一九四八年三月，前蒋匪“华南绥靖主任”宋子文经麦克阿瑟的“介绍”，聘请日本战犯前驻汪逆精卫伪政府公使的堀内干城和另一名日本财阀要员山田忠为顾问。
    日本重要侵华战犯之一、前中国派遣军总司令冈村宁次，在日本投降后，一直充任蒋匪介石的顾问，策划反对中国人民的罪恶战争。去年一月在国民党南京匪巢危急时，麦克阿瑟又与国民党匪帮狼狈为奸，由国民党匪帮出面宣布冈村宁次无罪开释，送回日本。冈村被释返日后，在麦克阿瑟的指使下，即为蒋匪招募日军。蒋匪驻日代表团主管军事的第一组组长曹士澄，即曾经常派员与冈村联络，从事招募日人到台湾帮助蒋匪作战。美国基督教科学箴言报的驻日记者，根据“盟军”及蒋匪高级军官处的材料，也证实冈村宁次是计划利用日军参加中国战争的主要人物之一。
    除了冈村宁次以外，许多经过麦克阿瑟释放并在其卵翼下的日本战犯，均在从事招募所谓“日本志愿军”的勾当，其中包括前华北派遣军司令根本博，前日本海军部在上海的特务机关长儿玉誉志夫，著名“黑龙会”法西斯分子横山雄伟等。根本博且早于去年七月即已抵达台湾。据今年一月一日日本《真相》杂志报道：在为蒋匪募兵的阴谋活动中，冈村宁次、根本博和曾在日本侵华派遣军总司令部第二课工作的特务辻政信等人担任主要的编组工作；担任招兵的是：儿玉誉志夫、法西斯军人三上卓、前驻山西日军司令官澄田?四郎中将及其第一军参谋长山冈道武少将；担任资本筹划的是：儿玉誉志夫、佐宅田秋海军大佐和阪田诚盛等；担任收购武器的是：前开封特务机关长佐藤玄一中将（华名“左玄龙”）等；担任在日本各地从事游说、纠合与联络的是：内山完造和山田纯三郎等。此外，在募兵阴谋活动中与国民党残匪“结成特殊关系”的日本战犯，为数极多，前陆军系统中（都是少将级）有：驻华派遣军总参谋长今井武夫、田中隆吉、川木芳太郎、前田正实、渡边渡等；前特务机关系统中有：冈田芳政、福家俊一、川口忠笃等；前对华情报系统中有：北原龙雄、草野文男等；前外交系统中有：汉口总领事三浦义秋、南京总领事须磨弥吉郎、驻北京公使土田丰、情报机关的岩井英一等。现任吉田茂的民主自由党最高顾问币原喜重郎，前政友会总裁、民主自由党的前身自由党总裁鸠山一郎，前汪逆伪政府的经济顾问犬养健，前政友会干事长、军需财阀久原房之助，前驻菲律宾大使、住友财阀代表之一村田省藏，以及法西斯分子横山雄伟等，也参加了招募“日本志愿军”的阴谋活动。该杂志并指出：侵华战争的积极支持者、前朝鲜总督宇垣一成也与募兵勾当有关。
    为了招募“日本志愿军”，吴匪铁城，蒋匪“新闻顾问”董显光，及匪“东南军政长官公署供应司令”何世礼，曾先后在去年八月至十二月间亲自赴日活动。吴匪且曾与麦克阿瑟和横山雄伟会商。现在关于美、蒋与日本战犯相互勾结对中国人民作战的罪行，就连日本官方人士也公然承认不讳。据合众社去年十一月十二日电，日本政府检察长植田俊吉在答复众议员质询时，承认日本“若干志愿兵实际上已赴台湾参加国民党军”。
    在所谓“日本志愿军”中，有许多是日本空军人员。合众社去年九月十二日东京电引“某匿名消息灵通人士”谈话称：“已有两百名日本空军‘志愿兵’在台湾聚集，准备参加对中共作战”。该电并透露：蒋匪介石去年四月间在杭州时即已制定招募日本航空员来华参战的计划，后来蒋匪即拨出一千二百万美元作该计划的资金。美国占领当局的高级官员也公开承认日本战犯组织日本空军人员帮助蒋匪屠杀中国人民。合众社去年十二月二日东京电称：“一位占领当局高级官员说：前日本驻台湾高级陆军军官正进行组织日本人的外国空军大队为国民党作战的消息，是真实的。”这个消息证明，最近美制匪机疯狂轰炸我解放区屠杀和平居民的滔天罪行，是在美国占领者所支持的、日本战犯所组织的“日本志愿军”的直接参预下进行的。
