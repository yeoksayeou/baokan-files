　　Party Work at the 70th Arsenal Bogged Down in Unprincipled Disputes
    (Report One)
    By Our Reporter Shang Kai
    The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the 70th Arsenal in Beijing, abandoned the Party's leading role in production, seriously neglected that the main content of the factory branch work is to guarantee and supervise the completion of production tasks, and spent all day arguing over some unprincipled issues, turning the entire Party organization into a club, causing huge losses to production. The General Branch Committee of the factory has not yet fully realized the seriousness of the error.
    The 70th Arsenal was a Kuomintang military industrial manufacturing factory before liberation. It now has a total of 1,700 employees, 170 Party members, and 200 Youth League members, of which about 30 have relatively long Party membership (all are the factory's leading backbone). The Party's foundation is good. Last September, the factory stopped military production and switched to producing machine parts such as water pumps, taps, and dies. After the Party went public in July, the Party's foundation gradually expanded, and the branch was changed to a general branch, with five branches under it. Chen Chi served as the secretary of the general branch, and Jia Xiaodong (military representative) and five others served as members of the general branch committee, some concurrently serving as branch secretaries. Because the branch did not understand that Party work should revolve around production in its Party building and Youth League building work, its work lost its direction and fell into unprincipled disputes. Many problems that urgently needed to be solved inside and outside the Party were delayed for a long time and have not been resolved to this day. For example, at the North China Workers' Representative Conference in April last year, it was proposed to establish a factory management committee to implement the democratization of factory management. However, the military representative and the general branch of the factory used the excuse that the masses were not sufficiently aware, and that there was not enough brewing and education, etc., and have not established it to this day. After the factory switched industries last September, due to workers' unfamiliarity with the new production technology and unreasonable labor organization, production efficiency was very low. In order to stimulate workers' production enthusiasm, a small number of administrative cadres hastily implemented an excess bonus system. Beforehand, they had neither established a scientific and complete industrial system and strict inspection system, nor determined various quotas in the production process. As a result of this implementation, the quantity of products increased rapidly, some exceeding 100% to 200%; while the quality of products dropped sharply. The specification of the water pump with 120 pounds of pressure, some dropped to 80 pounds. At the same time, due to the lack of work-hour records in each department, the workers' production achievements were evaluated by everyone based on their usual performance, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers and affected their production enthusiasm. Later, when it was discovered that the implementation of excess bonuses was biased, the military representative did not comprehensively consider the fundamental way to correct the bias, but was busy convening inspection personnel to hold meetings and formulate detailed rules for the inspection system. In fact, without fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of Party members and workers and without establishing a complete industrial system, the inspection system cannot be accurately implemented. This inspection system has been implemented for three months, but no effect has occurred. The problem has not been solved to this day.
    The unsatisfactory situation existing in the factory is inseparable from the shortcomings of the leadership of the Party's general branch and the military representative. After Chen Chi, secretary of the general branch, arrived at the factory last April, without a comprehensive investigation and research, he concluded that "the masses have basically not been mobilized," criticizing the trade union as "running the trade union while sitting in the house." However, he could neither provide practical examples nor put forward specific opinions, which caused dissatisfaction among everyone. Party work became even more disconnected from production, and branch meetings were often without content and lacked preparation. Sometimes, when a meeting was held, Chen Chi himself did not know what to discuss, and everyone temporarily thought of a few questions to talk about, and often disagreed on some minor issues, so it rarely formed any resolutions. Criticism and self-criticism were not carried out either.
    When discussing the establishment of a factory management committee, because they lacked the idea of relying on workers to restore production, and did not recognize the importance of the factory management committee, they did not actively study how to establish it from the process of strengthening Party work and improving workers' awareness. Instead, some said, "The masses' awareness is very poor." Some said, "The masses' awareness is just not enough." Some even mistakenly believed that the establishment of the factory management committee was only a matter for the Party and the trade union. They argued over these opinions, but did not study the specific steps for establishing the factory management committee.
    Similarly, in a general branch meeting, when talking about the issue of production management, because everyone did not understand production management, and did not conduct investigation and research, and did not understand how to establish and improve various systems step by step at that time, some vaguely proposed, "A set of systems must be established." Some then said, "The system is not established in one day, it must be done slowly." However, several months have passed, and the system has still not been soundly established. They have been arguing repeatedly over this issue.
    When discussing the issue of wage adjustment, they did not conduct a comprehensive investigation and research beforehand, and did not understand how many people's wages were unreasonable. When the meeting was held, some said, "Most of the wages in the Second Department are unreasonable." Some then said, "Only a few of the wages in the Second Department are unreasonable." They had no materials as a basis, argued for a long time, and no one could convince anyone.
    Due to abandoning leadership over production, the general branch became weak and incompetent, had very low prestige among the masses, and its work was very passive. Li Benzeng, a member of the general branch committee, said, "Our general branch has never solemnly studied production or the work of the trade union or the Youth League. Even the joint meeting of branch secretaries cannot be convened on time." When dealing with the issue of year-end bonuses, because the masses' awareness was underestimated, the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League shirked responsibility from each other. As a result, no one mobilized or explained to the workers, and instead mistakenly issued double pay as the year-end bonus, which accounted for 20% of the monthly salary.
    After Chen Chi, secretary of the general branch, hit a snag, he became passive and discouraged. Whenever a production meeting was held, he always used headaches, having to go to the municipal party committee, or writing some report as an excuse not to participate. He himself neither understood production nor patiently studied, completely forgetting what responsibilities the branch secretary in the factory should bear for production. At the general branch meeting, when someone mentioned issues related to production leadership, he said, "This is an administrative matter, don't talk about it here."
    Recently, the Air Defense Committee was established. When discussing how to dig air-raid shelters, the administration advocated mobilizing workers to dig in their spare time, while the trade union advocated stopping production during production time to dig. Comrade Chen Chi is also a member of the Air Defense Committee, but he does not understand in what way the general branch should guarantee and supervise the completion of this task, so as to protect the factory and workers' safety, and prevent production from suffering losses. He allowed everyone to argue at the meeting, but he himself could not put forward any opinions, and the air-raid shelter has not been dug to this day. The general branch also does not urge. Similarly, opinions also differed between the trade union and the administration on the issue of organizing a rescue team and the issue of conducting worker education. The secretary of the general branch did not express any opinions on these issues, and let them drift.
    The General Branch Committee has lost its core leadership role and has become a formality. The military representative, Jia Xiaodong, often handles some important matters on his own. For example, last winter, the issue of distributing half a ton of heating coal to each worker, but the higher authorities stipulated that those living in collective dormitories should not be given (originally supplied by the public). Jia Xiaodong neither passed it through the general branch nor explained and mobilized among the workers through the trade union, but simply implemented it with administrative orders. This bureaucratic style caused great misunderstanding among the workers, and even led to a meeting for petitioning.
    The general branch has not studied the work of the trade union. The Party group in the trade union has never reported to the general branch. The work steps of the trade union and the general branch are often inconsistent. Once, the trade union, according to the instructions of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, carried out internationalist education among the workers. The general branch separately arranged for Party members to study the Party constitution and program, and no one cared about the other.
    The New Democratic Youth League also does not respect the leadership of the Party. Zhang Ziwen, a member of the general branch committee and secretary of the Youth League general branch, has never reported the work of the Youth League to the Party general branch. Once, according to the instructions of its superiors, the Youth League general branch wanted to universally launch the signing of apprenticeship contracts and carry out the study of young workers. The Party general branch committee disagreed with their approach, believing that it should be carried out with a focus, but the Youth League general branch arranged it through its own organization on its own initiative. Later, it failed, and the Party general branch did not pay any attention to it.
    The above is only one aspect of the "Party Life" reporter's investigation into the Party work of the 70th Arsenal, indicating that the Party's leadership in the factory has a very serious situation, which urgently needs to be addressed by relevant parties. In January of this year, Sun Guoliang of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, participated in a general branch meeting. At the meeting, the members of the general branch committee reported the situation and opinions to him. Sun Guoliang took notes of these materials and took them away, but there has been no follow-up to this day. According to the reporter's understanding, the members of the factory's general branch committee also have many opinions on this. I hope it will be resolved soon.

　　七十兵工厂党的工作陷入在无原则纠纷中
    （报告之一）
    本报记者  商恺
    北京七十兵工厂中共总支委员会，放弃了党对生产的领导作用，严重地忽视了工厂支部工作的主要内容是保证与监督生产任务的完成，而终日为一些无原则的问题争吵不休，整个党的组织成了俱乐部，使生产受到巨大损失。而该厂总支委至今尚未完全觉悟到错误的严重性。
    七十兵工厂，在解放前是一个国民党的军工制造工厂。现共有职工一千七百余人，党员一百七十人，团员二百人，其中党龄较长的约三十余人（全是该厂领导骨干），党的基础是好的。去年九月该厂停止军工生产，转业生产水泵，丝锥，板牙等机器零件。七月党公开后，党的基础逐渐扩大，支部改为总支，下设五个分支，陈池任总支书，贾晓东（军代表）等六人为总支委员，有的并兼任分支书。由于支部在建党、建团等工作中，不懂得把党的工作围绕着生产来进行，致使工作迷失方向，陷于无原则纠纷。使许多党内外迫切需要解决的问题长期拖延，至今未得解决。例如在去年四月华北职工代表会上，即提出了建立工厂管理委员会，实行工厂管理民主化。但该厂军代表和总支都借口群众觉悟不高，酝酿教育不够等等，直到今天还没有成立。去年九月工厂转业后，由于工人对新的生产技术不熟练，劳动组织不合理，生产效率非常低下。少数行政干部，为了刺激工人生产情绪，草率地实行了超额给奖制。他们在事前既没有建立科学的完整的工务制度与严密的检验制度，又没有在生产过程中确定各种定额。这样实行的结果，产品数量迅速增高，有的超过了百分之一百到二百；而产品质量则急剧下降，规格为一百廿磅压力的水泵，有的竟降低到八十磅。同时各所因缺乏工时记录，工人的生产成绩，由大家根据每人平日表现来评奖，引起工人不满，反而影响了生产情绪。等到后来发现实行超额给奖有偏向，军代表也没有全面地考虑纠正偏向的根本办法，只是忙于召集检验人员开会，拟定检验制度细则。实际上在没有充分地发动党员和工人的生产热情和没有建立一套完整的工务制度以前，检验制度是无法精确执行的。这一检验制度实行了三个月，并未发生什么效果。至今问题尚未解决。
    该厂存在的这种不能令人满意的状况，是和党总支、军代表领导的若干缺点分不开的。去年四月总支书陈池到厂后，未经全面地调查研究，就对该厂工作做出结论说：“群众基本没有发动。”指责工会是“坐在屋里办工会”。但既举不出实际例证，又提不出具体意见，引起大家的不满。党的工作与生产更加脱节，支部会议常常是没有内容与缺乏准备。有时候开会了，陈池自己也不知道要讨论什么，大家临时想几个问题谈谈，又常常在一些枝节问题上意见分歧，因此很少形成过什么决议。也没有开展批评与自我批评。
    讨论成立工厂管理委员会的时候，由于他们缺少依靠工人恢复生产的思想，对工管会的重要性认识不够，因此不去积极研究如何从加强党的工作提高工人觉悟的过程中来建立，反而有的说：“群众觉悟很差。”有的说：“群众觉悟只是不够。”有的更错误地认为建立工管会只是党和工会的事。他们就为这些意见争吵起来，而不去研究工管会成立的具体步骤。
    同样的，在一次总支会议上，谈到生产管理的问题，因为大家都不懂生产管理，又没有调查研究，不了解当时应如何有步骤地去建立与健全各种制度，因此有的笼统的提出：“必须建立一套制度。”有的便说：“制度不是一天建立的，必须慢慢的来。”可是几个月过去了，制度仍然没有健全地建立起来。他们为了这个问题，只是反复地吵个不休。
    讨论调整工资问题时，他们事前都不作全面的调查研究，不了解有多少人的工资不合理，到开会时，有的说：“二所工资大部分不合理。”有的便说：“二所工资只有少数不合理。”他们都没有材料作根据，争吵了半天，谁也说服不了谁。
    由于对生产放弃领导，总支变得软弱无能，在群众中威信很低，工作十分被动。总支委李本曾说：“我们总支从没有郑重地研究过生产或工会、青年团的工作。连分支书联席会也不能按时召集。”在处理年终奖金问题时，因为过低估计群众觉悟，党、政、工、团互相推诿，结果是谁也不向工人动员解释，反而错误地将占月薪百分之二十的年终奖金发成了双薪。
    总支书陈池碰了钉子后，便消极自馁。每逢开生产会议，他总是以头疼、要到市委去、或者是写什么报告等作借口而不肯参加。他自己既不懂生产，又不耐心地去学习，完全忘记了工厂中的支部书记对生产应负什么责任。在总支会上，有人提到有关生产领导等问题时，他便说：“这是行政上的事，不要在这里谈。”
    最近防空委员会成立了，当讨论到如何挖防空壕时，行政上主张在工余发动工人去挖，工会则主张在生产时间停工去挖。陈池同志也是防空委员之一，但他不懂得总支应以什么方式保证并监督完成这一任务，以保护工厂及工人安全，使生产不受损失。在会上任大家争吵，他自己则提不出意见，防空壕至今尚未挖成。总支也不督促。同样在组织救护队的问题，进行工人教育的问题，工会和行政的意见也发生分歧。总支书对这些问题，却不表示任何意见，听其自流。
    总支委员会失去了核心领导作用，变为形式。军代表贾晓东有些重要的事情也就常常自行处理。例如：去年冬天给每个工人发半吨烤火煤的问题，但上级规定住集体宿舍的不发（原由公家供给）。贾晓东既未通过总支，又未通过工会在工人中进行解释动员，便单纯的用行政命令去执行，这种官僚主义作风，引起工人很大的误会，甚至要开会请愿。
    总支没有研究过工会工作。工会中的党组也从来未向总支作过汇报。工会和总支工作步调常不一致。有一次工会根据市总工会指示，在工人中开展国际主义教育。总支却另外布置党员学习党章党纲，谁也不管谁。
    新民主主义青年团也不尊重党的领导。总支委兼团总支书记张子文，也从未向党总支汇报过团的工作。有一次团总支根据其上级指示，要普遍发动签订师徒合同，和开展青工学习。党的总支委不同意他们这种做法，认为应有重点的进行，但是团总支便自行通过自己的组织布置下去，后来失败了，党总支也不予过问。
    以上所述，只是“党的生活”记者在调查七十兵工厂党的工作中的一个侧面，说明该厂党的领导存在着十分严重的情况，急应引起有关方面注意解决。今年一月间北京市委组织部孙国良，曾参加了一次总支会议。会上总支委员们把情况和意见报告给他，孙国良将这些材料记下带走后，至今尚未见下文。据记者了解，该厂总支委员对此也颇有意见。希望早日解决。
