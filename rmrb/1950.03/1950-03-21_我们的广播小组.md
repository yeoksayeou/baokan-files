　　Our Broadcasting Group
    Li Pengfei, Fourth Branch of the Beijing National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union

    Our broadcasting group was officially established on January 3rd, with the help and guidance of Comrade Yu Xiang from the shop assistants' work group of the Second District Trade Union Office. It has a total of fifty members, divided into three broadcasting groups, each group electing one leader and two recorders. Every evening at nine o'clock, the group leader convenes the members of the group, everyone sits together, and the recorder reads aloud the records of the day's radio listening in detail. The group leader raises questions based on the content, and everyone begins to discuss. At first, during discussions, everyone looked at each other, feeling it was really boring.

    Later, we became more and more interested in listening to the radio. After discussing the "Situation of Implementing the Telegraph Contract System" spoken of by Comrade Hu Zhiqing of the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the comrades of the galenical pharmacy department of the first trade union group connected it to their own work. Previously, because no one was specifically responsible for preparing medicinal materials, it often delayed the supply for retail sales, or it was rushed at the last minute, causing a frantic mess. Everyone humbly discussed this shortcoming and unanimously decided to learn from the "division of labor responsibility system of the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Tianjin Railway Bureau." The result of implementation overcame the shortcomings of the work, the production volume was greatly increased, and the work also appeared to be more orderly.

    After listening to the new record creation movement of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the production and savings situations of other factories, everyone's work attitude began to change. They became more enthusiastic in their work and also paid attention to conservation. The storeroom of the galenical pharmacy department used to be covered in dust and the goods were often damaged. After a thorough cleaning by everyone, as well as the proper storage of all goods, and regular management and sunning, the room remained clean and well-ventilated, and the goods no longer suffered any damage. Because production increased, our welfare also improved according to the provisions of the labor-capital collective contract. Our workers in the cutting medicine department, pill department, prepared medicine department, and business department, because of the improvement of class consciousness, overcame the previous laxity phenomenon. These many facts are inseparable from listening to the radio. Now all our members are still studying what methods to use to unite and urge the capitalists to formulate production plans.

    Listening to the radio has become the most important task in our daily life. The radio plays a guiding role in our learning and production; listening to the radio has improved our working methods, raised class consciousness, learned new songs, and learned many things. In a word, the benefits of listening to the radio are endless.

　　我们的广播小组
    北京市国药业工会第四分会  李鹏飞
    我们广播小组，在二区工会办事处店员工作组于祥同志的帮助指导下，在一月三号正式建立起来了。共有组员五十人，分编成三个广播小组，每组选出组长一人，记录员二人。在每天晚上九点钟的时候，由组长召集本组组员，大家坐在一起，由记录员把当天收听广播的记录，详细的念给大家听，组长根据内容提出问题，大家开始讨论。起先讨论的时候大家你看看我，我看看你，觉着实在没劲。
    后来，我们对收听广播就越来越有兴趣了。在讨论天津铁路局北京电报所胡志清同志讲的“实行电报包台制的情形”以后，工会第一组生制药部的工友同志，连系到自己的工作。以前制药材，因为没有专人负责，所以常常耽误供应门市售卖，或者是临时赶制，弄得手忙脚乱。大家都很虚心的讨论出这个缺点，一致决议学习“天津铁路局北京电报所的分工负责制”，实行的结果，克服了工作的缺点，生产量大大的提高了，工作也显得有秩序了。
    听了石景山钢铁厂创造新纪录运动和其他厂子的生产节约情形，大家的劳动态度开始改变，干起活来都卖劲了，对于节约方面也注意了：生制药部的货房，以前是尘土狼籍货物常有损坏，经过全体的大扫除，以及所有货物的适当的存置，和定期的管理晒晾，在屋内保持着整洁和空气流通，货物不再受到一点损失。因为生产提高了，根据劳资集体合同的规定，我们的福利也改进了。我们切药部，丸药部，成药部，营业部工友，都因为阶级觉悟的提高克服了以前的散漫现象，这许多事实都跟收听广播是分不开的。现在我们全体会员还在研究用什么方法团结并督促资方，订立生产计划。
    收听广播已经成为我们日常生活中最重要的一件工作，广播对我们的学习和生产都起了指导的作用；收听广播，改进了我们的工作方法，提高了阶级觉悟，学会了新歌曲，知道了许多事，一句话，收听广播的好处说不完。
