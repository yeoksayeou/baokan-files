    Resolving the Livelihoods of Some Disaster Victims
    [Report from this newspaper] Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: Since January, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Cooperative, in response to the province's severe disaster situation, has vigorously carried out a production self-relief movement. According to investigations, 1.5 million of the 9 million disaster victims in Hebei province are living in extreme difficulty. The most severely affected areas are Ninghe, Baodi, and Tianjin counties in the Tianjin Special District, Yutian in the Tangshan Special District, and Ji County in the Tong County Special District. To implement the policy of production for self-relief, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Cooperative, through supply and marketing business, organized cooperatives in various regions. On the one hand, it actively promoted the sale of existing products of disaster victims, and on the other hand, it supplied production raw materials to organize disaster victims to produce, exchanging them for essential daily necessities, thereby partially solving the livelihood problems of disaster victims. At the same time, it laid a favorable foundation for the development of cooperative business. In terms of organizing textile production, according to statistics from Ji County, Xianghe, Sanhe, and Yutian counties, 32,200 looms have been restored, 15,043 pieces of foreign yarn and 18,299 jin of local thread have been supplied, and 84,533 bolts of local cloth have been purchased. It is estimated that the masses can gain a net profit of 1,957,500 jin of millet from weaving production. Based on a consumption of half a jin of grain per person per day, this can sustain more than 20,000 people for three months. According to statistics from Tangshan, Tianjin, Cang County, Tong County, and Baoding five special districts in February, a total of 1,175,746 bolts of local cloth produced in disaster areas were sold through local cooperatives and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Cooperative, and disaster victims can obtain a profit of 12,000,000 jin of coarse grain. If each person consumes half a jin of grain per day, this can solve the livelihood of more than 260,000 people for three months. The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Cooperative has also achieved success in supporting the production of mats by disaster victims. Up to now, a total of 159,160 mats have been purchased in the Tong County, Tianjin, and Baoding special districts, and mat weavers have obtained a net profit of 46,023 jin of grain. With the support of the cooperatives, the saltpeter industry has also been further developed. According to statistics from Ji County, Xianghe, and Shunyi counties in the Tong County Special District, Anxin County in the Baoding Special District, and Wen'an County in the Tianjin Special District, a total of 573 saltpeter pots have been organized, with 25,927 people participating in saltpeter boiling. In January, cooperatives purchased more than 4.33 million jin of saltpeter. To ensure the sale of saltpeter, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Cooperative has signed a contract with the North China Chemical Company to purchase 30 million jin of saltpeter on its behalf. In terms of fishery production, in Anxin and Wen'an counties alone, 7,829 fishing households have been organized, and 13,325 people are currently engaged in fishing. In addition, a large number of straw hat braids, pockets, fish, shrimp, medicinal materials, and other items have been purchased through cooperatives in disaster areas, totaling 19,680,000 jin of coarse grain, which has solved the livelihood problems of many disaster victims.
