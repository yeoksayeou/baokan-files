    Frantically Persecuting the People of Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, facing its doom, is inflicting frantic persecution on peaceful residents of Taiwan. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 15th, citing talks with people from Taiwan, the Kuomintang remnant bandits recently secretly arrested 300 people in Taiwan. Before and after this, the bandit gang also carried out mountain area sweeps, forcibly confiscating civilian self-defense firearms, and forcibly "organizing and training" fishermen in coastal counties. According to a dispatch from the Taiwan bandit "New Agency" on the 28th of last month, the Taiwan bandit police department will also conduct a comprehensive household registration check throughout Taiwan starting on April 2nd.
