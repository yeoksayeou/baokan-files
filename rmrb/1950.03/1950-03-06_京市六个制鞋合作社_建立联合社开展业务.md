　　Six Shoe-Making Cooperatives in Beijing
    Establish Joint Cooperative to Develop Business

    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Shoe-Making Cooperative Joint Cooperative is one of the joint cooperatives among the thirty-three production cooperatives in the capital. Since its establishment in mid-January, it has contracted a large number of leather shoes and cloth shoes, and its business has rapidly developed. After two months of creation and experimentation, it has achieved considerable success in developing production cooperative business and has set an example in organizing production cooperative joint cooperatives.

    The joint cooperative is composed of six shoe-making production cooperatives: Xinping Road, Daji Lane, Anyuan Hutong, Dong'an, Taipusi Street, and Women's Friendship. It has a total of 362 members and four production teams. Although these production cooperatives are different from each other, they all have weak capital, lack technology, and find it difficult to develop business. In addition, because the work cannot be sustained, there is a common phenomenon of doing and stopping, and some cannot even maintain themselves. Moreover, due to insufficient manpower and resources, they dare not contract large quantities of work even when there is work. As a result, they form: "Anxious when there is work, and anxious when there is no work." Under these circumstances, the cooperatives generated a demand to organize a joint cooperative. Later, with the advocacy and promotion of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the joint cooperative was quickly established.

    After the establishment of the joint cooperative, the funds for purchasing materials were solved by the shares subscribed by each member cooperative (50 kilograms of millet per share, with each member cooperative subscribing to at least five shares), plus the loan from the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank of China's Beijing Branch, and the 1.1 billion yuan deposit received from contracting 10,000 pairs of leather shoes and 50,000 pairs of cloth shoes. After jointly contracting a large number of shoes, the business of each member cooperative turned to prosperity. In February, Daji Lane Cooperative undertook more than 600 pairs of leather shoes, which was three times higher than the monthly output from December of last year to January of this year. The business of Xinping Road Cooperative and other cooperatives has also developed after the establishment of the joint cooperative.

    The development of the joint cooperative's business has also driven 241 unemployed workers in various districts to establish four shoe-making production teams (distributed in the first, ninth, tenth, and thirteenth districts). Because the joint cooperative needs a large number of custom-made cowhides, some unemployed workers also automatically formed a leather-making production cooperative. In addition, a military-affiliated shoe factory, two military-affiliated lining factories, and a hemp rope production cooperative in the third district have also become active.

            Organization and System of the Joint Cooperative
    The highest authority of the joint cooperative is the members' representative assembly (composed of representatives elected by all member cooperatives in proportion to the number of people). The daily work is led by the council elected by the assembly. The functions of the council are: to formulate business and production plans, to hire and dismiss technical and management personnel, and to deploy and inspect work, etc. The representative assembly also elects a board of supervisors to supervise the council's implementation of resolutions.

    The distribution of the joint cooperative's surplus is decided by the members' assembly. Those with good work efficiency and product quality are rewarded after being evaluated by employees and members of each cooperative and approved by the board of supervisors. When the joint cooperative has losses, it is compensated with public accumulation funds, shares, etc.

            Three Advantages
    According to the initial operating experience, there are the following advantages after organizing the joint cooperative. (1) Due to the concentration of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, it is convenient for the leadership of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the support of the National Bank, and it is possible to contract orders in large quantities and continuously. (2) Because the products must have certain specifications, it can promote the standardization of products in each production cooperative, which is convenient for opening up sales. (3) Because the joint cooperative implements unified planning of materials, unified contracting, and unified processing, a lot of manpower can be saved in business. Unified cutting of leather shoe uppers (processing) can save three inches of leather per pair compared to decentralized cutting (decentralized cutting requires about four feet and three inches of leather per pair, while unified cutting only requires four feet). Based on the joint cooperative's contract of 10,000 pairs of leather shoes, it can save 3,000 feet of leather uppers.

    The joint cooperative has provided a lot of help to each member cooperative and has been unanimously supported by each member cooperative. There is a phenomenon of haggling over the high or low profits of one's own unit, which needs to be educated and corrected. (Jin Yu)

　　京市六个制鞋合作社
    建立联合社开展业务
    【本报讯】北京制鞋合作社联合社，是首都三十三个生产合作社中的一个联合社。从一月中旬建立以来，即承包了大量的皮鞋、布鞋，业务迅速得到开展。经过两个月的创建实验，在开展生产合作社业务上获得相当成就，并且在组织生产社联合社中作出一个榜样。
    该联合社是由新平路、大吉巷、按院胡同、东安、太仆寺街、妇女联谊等六个制鞋生产社组成的。共拥有三百六十二个社员和四个生产小组。这些生产社虽然各有不同，但都是资金薄弱，缺乏技术，业务难得开展。又因来活不能持续不断，普遍有时做时停的现象，有的甚至不能维持。更因人力、资力不足，有活时也不敢大批承包。结果形成：“有活也着急，无活也着急”。在这种情况下，各社产生了组织联合合作社的要求。后经市供销总社倡导和推动，联合社便很快的成立了。
    联合社建立后，各社员社应征的股金（小米五十斤为一股，每社员社至少认五股）加上人民银行北京分行合作部的贷款，再加上承包一万双皮鞋和五万双布鞋收进的十一亿元定货款，购料的资金随之得到解决。联合承包大量鞋子后，各社员社的业务随之转向繁荣。大吉巷社在二月份中承做了六百多双皮鞋，较去年十二月至今年一月的月产量增高三倍。新平路社等社的业务，也在联合社成立后得到发展。
    联合社业务的发展，又带动各区失业工人二百四十一名成立了四个制鞋生产小组（分布在一、九、十、十三四个区）。由于联合社需要大量定制牛皮，又一部分失业工人也自动组成了制革生产合作社。另外，三区原有的一个军属制鞋工厂、两个军属隔褙工厂和麻绳生产合作社，也都随着活跃起来。
            联合社的组织与制度
    该联合社的最高权力机关是社员代表大会（由全体社员社按照人数比例选举代表组成）。日常工作则由大会选出之理事会领导。理事会的职权为：制定业务与生产计划，聘任及解雇技术、经理人员，布置与检查工作等。代表大会并另选监事会，负责监督理事会对决议的执行。
    联合社的盈余的分配由社员大会决定，对工作效率与产品质量较好者经职工与各社社员分别评定，监事会通过后予以奖励。联合社有亏损时，以公积金、股金等补偿。
            三个优点
    根据初期经营的经验，组织联合社以后有以下几个优点。（一）由于人力、物力与财力的集中，便于供销总社领导，便于国家银行扶植，可以大批地连续地承包定货。（二）因为产品必须有一定的规格，所以可以促使各生产社产品渐趋标准化，便于打开销路。（三）因为联合社实行统筹材料统一承包和统一加工，在业务上可以节省很多人力。皮鞋面皮统一划料（加工），比分散划料每双可省皮三寸（分散划每双需皮约四尺三寸，统一划只需四尺）。以该社这次承包的一万双皮鞋计算，可节省面皮达三千尺。
    联合社对各社员社的业务有很多帮助，得到各社员社的一致拥护。时有斤斤计较本单位利润高低的现象，需要教育纠正。（靳羽）
