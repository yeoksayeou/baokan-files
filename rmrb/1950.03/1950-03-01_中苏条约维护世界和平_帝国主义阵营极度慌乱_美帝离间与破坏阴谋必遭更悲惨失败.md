Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th: The publication of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the other two important agreements has caused great shock and extreme panic in the imperialist camp headed by U.S. imperialism. It is interesting to examine this reaction from the comments of the imperialist countries' news agencies and newspapers.

Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th, honestly admitted that the Sino-Soviet Treaty and agreements are a just and equal cooperation. The telegram said: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty is undoubtedly an extremely important document. These two countries with the largest populations in the world will devote themselves to international political cooperation and foresee military cooperation when they encounter war threats from the East." The two countries, China and the Soviet Union, "not only signed a treaty that has nothing in common with the famous unequal treaties previously signed between China and Western countries, but the most important thing is that the Soviet Union abandoned all its rights to the Manchurian Railway and the port of Lushun, and China obtained all the buildings and other equipment in Dalian." The telegram believes that this treaty brings the socialist countries' "respect for the independence, integrity and sovereignty of the great Asian people to a climax, so this treaty will inevitably become a powerful weapon for anti-colonial propaganda." U.S. Senator Ferguson, a notorious aggressor, also had to admit that the treaty and agreements concluded between China and the Soviet Union "can only be interpreted as beneficial to China." However, the imperialists, who are accustomed to aggression, are unwilling to understand why there is such equal and friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and why there is such sincere and selfless assistance. Therefore, after admitting that the Sino-Soviet Treaty is a truly equal treaty, Agence France-Presse nervously exclaimed: "This is too good to be true." United Press International, Washington, 15th, also reported that U.S. officials also insisted on the "unbelievable" attitude of "this is too good." These precisely show that the imperialists have become complete idiots to equal international relations because of their aggressive nature.

The nature of the Sino-Soviet Treaty's firm maintenance of world peace is also undeniable by bourgeois public opinion. Agence France-Presse, Chenggong Lake, 16th, said that some United Nations personnel believe that the Sino-Soviet Treaty should be listed as a document of the regional agreement type that fully complies with the United Nations Charter and aims to "maintain international peace and security." And it believes that the treaty has "indisputable reputation" (according to Paris Humanité). Associated Press, London, 16th, said that foreign diplomats stationed in Moscow cannot but pay attention to the provision in the Sino-Soviet Treaty regarding "participating in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security."

It is precisely because of these indisputable and just nature of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and agreements that the U.S. imperialists feel that this is a heavy blow to the U.S. policy of aggression in the Far East. The U.S. aggressor Ferguson unreservedly admitted: "This alliance seriously hit our (referring to the United States) position in Asia. The published treaty is very effective propaganda and will be effective throughout the Far East." (United Press International, Washington, 15th) Ferguson sadly admitted that the U.S. slander about the Soviet Union as an "aggressor country" is no longer "tenable." Associated Press, Washington, 15th, said that the Sino-Soviet Treaty "dismantled the U.S. policy toward China," saying that Acheson had placed the "foundation of the U.S. policy toward China" on alienating Sino-Soviet relations, but now this hope has failed. The Associated Press also reported that the spirit of equality and friendship expressed in the Sino-Soviet Treaty is "particularly attractive" to the Japanese, worrying that the treaty's insistence on the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan will "encourage Japanese national sentiment and influence this sentiment to support the leadership of the Communist Party, and may eventually try to create a situation where the U.S. forces withdraw from Japan." (Associated Press, San Francisco, 19th) Reuters, Frankfurt, 16th, said that a German newspaper admitted that the U.S. government has "greatly misjudged" the political development in Asia for several years, and "it is difficult to escape the burden of this misjudgment of the development in Asia for several years." Precisely because of these reasons, the literary beggars of U.S. imperialism exclaimed that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and agreements is the "biggest transformation" and the "darkest nightmare," and that it means "the giant wheel of the world situation is rotating on the Moscow-Beijing axis."

In order to cover up their inner worries and anxieties, the imperialists deliberately adopted a contemptuous attitude towards the Sino-Soviet Treaty and fabricated rumors. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said at a press conference on the 15th that "the whole world does not know all the facts," and that "the new treaty is only the beginning of China's difficulties." U.S. President Truman made an even more absurd and ridiculous statement on the 16th. He said: "He did not read the full text of the treaty, but Acheson's position is excellent." (Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th) But the Washington Post admitted: "It is ineffective to try to obscure the fact of the amazing diplomatic victory recently obtained by Mao Zedong and Stalin in Moscow. The State Department sadly acknowledged that this is a fact." (According to Paris Humanité, 17th) Associated Press, San Francisco, 19th, also said: "If the Western world continues to merely despise the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it may tragically deceive itself. ... The Western world has a habit of always thinking that when it first takes care of its own needs, the rest of the world will patiently wait for the Western world, if it is willing to. Now we can consider the price that history has set for this habit." Of course, the imperialists will not be reconciled to their failure. United Press International, Washington, 17th, quoted Washington diplomatic sources as saying: "The United States will intensify its efforts to alienate the Soviet Union from the CCP and the Soviet Union from other Asian peoples who seem to be quite sympathetic to the Kremlin. This 'ideological struggle' will be an important move recommended by Acheson and Truman to send Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and his colleagues to inspect the diplomatic situation." Associated Press, Washington, 24th, revealed that this "ideological struggle" will be carried out through espionage. The telegram quoted Merchant, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, as saying: "In order to obtain reliable intelligence," U.S. intelligence agencies will "strengthen their strongholds in all countries bordering China, the entire periphery from Southeast Asia to the Near East and Africa." But it can be determined that this stupid action of U.S. imperialism can only enhance the vigilance and anger of the Chinese and Asian people, and cause the United States to suffer a more miserable failure.

　　中苏条约维护世界和平  帝国主义阵营极度慌乱
    美帝离间与破坏阴谋必遭更悲惨失败
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他两项重要协定的公布，在以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营中引起了极大的震动，并使其陷于极度慌乱的境地。从帝国主义国家通讯社和报纸的评论来考察一下这种反应是有兴味的。
    法新社巴黎十五日电比较老实地承认了中苏条约和协定是一种正义和平等的合作。该电说：“中苏条约无疑地是一个极为重要的文件，这两个世界上人口最多的国家，将致力于国际间的政治合作，并预示两国在遭遇来自东方的战争威胁时的军事合作。”中苏两国“不仅签订了一个与中国先前和西方国家间签订的著名不平等条约没有丝毫共同之处的条约，而且最主要地是苏联放弃它对满洲铁路及旅顺港口的一切权利，中国并且获得大连的一切建筑及其他一切设备。”该电认为这个条约使社会主义国家“对伟大的亚洲人民的独立、完整和主权的尊重达到最高潮，因此这个条约必然会成为反殖民地宣传的强有力武器。”美国著名侵略分子参议员福开森亦不能不同样承认：中国和苏联所缔结的条约和协定“只能解释为对中国是有利的”。然而习惯于以侵略为目的的帝国主义者，对于中苏之间为什么会有这种平等友谊的合作，为什么会有这种真诚无私的援助，是不愿意理解的。所以，法新社在承认了中苏条约是真正平等的条约之后，接着就神经质地大叫说：“这太好了，使人不能相信它是真的。”合众社华盛顿十五日电报也道说：美国官员同样坚持着“这太好了”的“不相信”态度。这些正表示了帝国主义者因为侵略成性而对平等的国际关系成为完全的白痴。
    中苏条约的坚决维护世界和平的性质，同样是资产阶级的舆论所不能否认的。法新社成功湖十六日电说：某些联合国人士认为中苏条约应列为完全附合联合国宪章的以“维持国际和平或安全”为目的的区域协定一类文件内。并认为该条约有“无可置喙的声望”。（据巴黎人道报载）美联社伦敦十六日电说：驻莫斯科的外国外交官员们不能不重视中苏条约中关于“参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动”的规定。
    正是由于中苏条约及协定这些不可辩驳的正义性质，所以美国帝国主义者就觉得这是对美国在远东的侵略政策的一个沉重打击。美国侵略分子福开森毫不隐晦地承认：“这个同盟严重地打击了我们（指美国）在亚洲的地位。已公布的条约是非常有效的宣传，在全远东都会发生效力。”（合众社华盛顿十五日电）福开森伤心地承认美国关于苏联“侵略国”的造谣已经“不能成立”。美联社华盛顿十五日电说：中苏条约“拆了美国对华政策的台”，说艾奇逊曾把“美国对华政策的基础”放在离间中苏关系上，但现在这种希望已经落空。美联社并报道称：中苏条约所表现的平等友好精神对日本人“特别有吸引力”，担心条约坚持及早缔结对日和约会“鼓励日本人的民族情绪并影响这种情绪赞成共产党的领导，并可能力图最后造成一种美国势力退出日本的情况。”（美联社旧金山十九日电）路透社法兰克福十六日电称：一家德国报纸承认美国政府几年来对亚洲的政治发展“大大判断错了”，而“逃脱这个几年来对亚洲发展判断错误的重担是困难的”。正因为这些缘故，美帝国主义的文丐们就惊呼中苏条约及协定的签订是“最大的转变”和“最黑暗的噩梦”，是表示“世界局势的巨轮在莫斯科——北京轴上旋转”。
    帝国主义者为掩盖其内心的忧惧不安，曾故意对中苏条约采取轻视态度，并制造谰言。美国务卿艾奇逊曾在十五日举行的记者招待会上说什么“全世界都没有知道全部事实”，说什么“新约不过是中国困难的开端而已”。美总统杜鲁门则于十六日发表了一个更为荒唐可笑的谈话。他说：“他没有读到条约的全文，但艾奇逊的立场是绝佳的。”（法新社华盛顿十六日电）但华盛顿邮报却承认说：“企图掩没毛泽东和斯大林最近在莫斯科获得的惊人的外交胜利这一事实，是无效的。国务院方面伤心地承认了这是一个事实。”（据巴黎人道报十七日载）美联社旧金山十九日电也说：“西方世界如果继续仅仅卑视中苏条约，也许会悲惨地欺骗了自己。……西方世界有一个习惯，总以为在它首先照顾自己的需要时，世界其余部分会耐心地等待西方世界，如果愿意的话。现在可以考虑一下历史对这种习惯所定的价格了。”当然，帝国主义者对于他们的失败是不会甘心的。合众社华盛顿十七日电即引华盛顿外交人士的话说：“美国将加紧努力离间苏联与中共以及苏联与似乎颇为同情克里姆林宫的其他亚洲人民。这种‘思想斗争’将是艾奇逊与杜鲁门派去视察外交情势的无任所大使耶塞普及其同僚所建议的重要的一着”。美联社华盛顿二十四日电则透露这种“思想斗争”将以间谍活动来进行。该电引美国负责远东事务助理国务卿帮办麦谦特的话说：“为了获得可靠的情报”，美国谍报机关将“加强中国边界一切国家中的据点，全部外围从东南亚直到近东和非洲”但可以断定，美帝国主义这种愚蠢行动，只能增强中国及亚洲人民的警惕和愤怒，并使美国遭受更悲惨的失败。
