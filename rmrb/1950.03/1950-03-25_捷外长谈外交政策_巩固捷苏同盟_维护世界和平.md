Xinhua News Agency, Prague: TASS reported that Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Široký, in a speech on foreign policy before the National Assembly's Foreign Policy Committee on the 21st, stated that the primary task of Czechoslovak foreign policy is to struggle for the safeguarding of world peace. The Soviet Union's peace policy has made the peace camp immensely strong, and this resolute and consistent peace diplomacy will surely defeat the imperialist diplomacy aimed at launching a war against the Soviet Union and against all progressive forces. The task of our foreign policy is to constantly consolidate and promote our alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union, thereby thwarting the imperialist war plans.

It is noted that the resignation of former Czech Foreign Minister Clementis was approved on the 14th. Czech President Gottwald has accepted Prime Minister Zápotocký's recommendation and appointed Deputy Prime Minister Široký as Foreign Minister.
