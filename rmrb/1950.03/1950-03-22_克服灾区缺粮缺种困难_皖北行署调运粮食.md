Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th. Under the national and East China region's unified grain allocation plan, grain transfer work in the Northern Anhui region is proceeding actively. The Northern Anhui Grain Transfer Headquarters was established in late February and formulated a transportation plan that includes both external transfer and internal allocation. To this end, the Transportation Department of the Northern Anhui Administrative Office has instructed the Huai River and Chaohu Navigation Bureaus to establish five offices on the main transportation lines in Sanhe City, Fuyang, Liu'an, Zhengyangguan, and Chaohu, and organized the necessary armed escort. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this task, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office has also formulated reward and punishment regulations. Relevant leading organs are sending cadres to participate in this work one after another. The Administrative Office's Grain Bureau dispatched more than 150 cadres to Sanhejian, the border area between Henan and Anhui on the upper reaches of the Huai River, on the 13th to form a grain transportation office to receive grain transferred from Henan Province to Northern Anhui. The Administrative Office recently sent personnel to Sanhe City in the Chaohu region to establish a transfer station from there to Shucheng, organizing forces to survey transportation lines to strengthen the transfer. The internal transfer plan in Northern Anhui is also being carried out in conjunction with production and disaster relief work. Among them, a part of the grain transferred from the Fuyang region to the severely affected Su County region has been shipped by both land and water routes. Comprehensive transfer work is being organized and prepared. The implementation of this transfer plan will overcome the food and seed shortages in the disaster areas of Northern Anhui, stabilize grain prices, and enable the people to carry out spring plowing smoothly.

　　克服灾区缺粮缺种困难
    皖北行署调运粮食
    【新华社合肥二十日电】在全国及华东区统一调剂粮食计划下，皖北区粮食调运工作正积极进行中。皖北调运指挥部早在二月下旬即已成立，并制定了包括外调接运及内地调剂的运输计划。皖北行署交通处为此已指令淮河、巢湖两航务管理局在主要运输线上建立三河市、阜阳、六安、正阳关和巢湖等五个办事处，并组织了必要的护运武装。皖北行署为保证此一任务的顺利完成，且制定了奖惩条例。各有关领导机关正陆续派出干部参加此项工作。行署粮食局已于十三日派干部一百五十余名赴淮河上游豫皖交界的三河尖组成运粮办事处，以接运自河南省调拨来皖北的粮食。行署近又派员前往巢湖专区的三河市建立该处至舒城一线的接交站，组织力量，勘定运输线，以加强调运。皖北内地的调运计划也在结合生产救灾工作进行中。其中由阜阳专区调拨至重灾区宿县专区的粮食一部已由水陆两线启运。全面的调运工作正在组织准备中。此项调运计划的实现，将克服皖北灾区的缺粮、缺种困难，并稳定粮价，使人民得以顺利进行春耕。
