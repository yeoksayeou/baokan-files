Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th. Delayed news: The People's Liberation Army marched into Northwest Sichuan in mid-January, and by February 9th, had liberated Wenchuan, Li County, Mao County, and Songpan counties. People from Jinghua (formerly Suijing) and Maogong counties also sent representatives to Mao County to welcome the People's Liberation Army; thus, all six counties in Northwest Sichuan were liberated. The Western Sichuan Administrative Office has now established a special administrative office in Mao County, and the people's governments of each county have also been established. On the 4th of this month, people from all walks of life in Mao County held a celebration of the liberation and the establishment of the People's Government. More than 2,000 people attended the meeting. A lantern parade was held at night. The marching crowd shouted slogans such as "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Citizens throughout the city were jubilant and excited, and the scene was unprecedented.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th. The People's Liberation Army units of the Western Sichuan Military Region are actively suppressing bandits. In the ten days from February 26th to March 7th, they annihilated more than 5,800 bandits and special agent armed forces. Currently, there are basically no organized bandits in Wenjiang, Guanxian, Pixian and other areas, and on both banks of the Minjiang River.

At the beginning of the liberation of the Western Sichuan region, bandit and special agent activities were very rampant. Most of the bandit leaders were special agents who had received specialized training in the so-called "guerrilla classes" established before the collapse of Hu Zongnan's bandit troops. They gathered habitual bandits and some reactionary local armed forces, as well as scattered soldiers and stragglers, and organized so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" and other counter-revolutionary armed forces. They robbed and sabotaged everywhere, murdered our local cadres, and attacked small units passing on our communication routes. In order to stabilize social order and protect the people in spring farming production, the People's Liberation Army began a comprehensive suppression of the remaining bandits in the area on February 26th. They successively carried out joint encirclements and suppressions in Pixian, Guanxian, Shuangliu, Xinjin, Wenjiang and other counties, as well as in the area between Xinfan and Chengdu, annihilating the bandit "Wen, Pi, Guan Three County Headquarters" and all its subordinates, as well as a part of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" entrenched in the above-mentioned areas, killing and wounding 648 bandits including the bandit chief "Wen, Pi, Guan Three County Commander" Chen Pu-zang and Deputy Commander Huang Cheng-zhu, and capturing 5,158 bandits including the "Guan, Wen, Pi County Deputy Commander" Zhu De-cheng, Chief of Staff Chen Da-zhou, and Wenjiang Self-Defense Corps Commander Dai Wen-bing. Four war defense guns, one mortar, 39 light and heavy machine guns, 962 rifles and other spoils of war were seized.

　　川西北汶川等六县解放
    专署及各县人民政府成立
    川西军区十天剿灭土匪五千八
    【新华社成都十九日电】迟到消息：人民解放军于一月中旬向川西北进军，至二月九日先后解放汶川、理县、茂县、松潘四县。靖化（原绥靖）、懋功两县人民继亦派代表到茂县欢迎人民解放军前往，川西北六县乃告全部解放。现川西行政公署已在茂县建立专署，各县人民政府亦已成立。本月四日茂县各界人民曾召开庆祝解放暨人民政府成立大会，参加大会者有两千余人。入夜举行提灯游行，游行队伍沿途高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“人民解放军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号，全城市民欢欣鼓舞，盛况空前。
    【新华社成都十九日电】人民解放军川西军区部队积极清剿土匪，自上月二十六日至本月七日十天中，共歼灭土匪及特务武装五千八百余人。现温江、灌县、郫县等地区及岷江两岸基本上已无股匪。
    川西地区解放之初，土匪特务活动甚为猖獗，匪首大部是在胡宗南匪部溃灭前设立的所谓“游击班”受过专门训练的特务分子，他们纠集惯匪与一些反动的地方武装以及散兵游勇，组织所谓“反共救国军”等反革命武装，到处抢劫破坏，并杀害我地方工作干部，袭击我交通道上过往的小部队。人民解放军为安定社会秩序，保护人民进行春耕生产，乃于二月二十六日开始对该地区残匪实行全面清剿，先后在郫县、灌县、双流、新津、温江等县，以及新繁、成都间地区进行合击围剿，歼灭匪“温、郫、灌三县总指挥部”及其所属全部以及盘踞上述地区之“反共救国军”匪一部，计毙伤匪首“温、郫、灌三县总指挥”陈匍臧、副总指挥黄承柱等以下六百四十八人，俘匪“灌、温、郫县副总指挥”祝德成、参谋长陈大周、温江自卫总队总队长戴文炳等以下五千一百五十八人。缴获战防炮四门，迫击炮一门，轻重机枪三十九挺，长短枪九百六十二枝，及其他战利品甚多。
