　　Dutch Imperialism Delays Troop Withdrawal Date
    Attempts to Continue Control of Indonesia
    Hatta Relies on American Imperialism to Oppress Small Puppet States; The Indonesian "Westerling Affair" Temporarily Concludes
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] The contradictions between the Indonesian Hatta government, backed by American imperialism, and Dutch imperialism are becoming increasingly apparent. According to a Jakarta dispatch: The Indonesian government has launched a campaign to dissolve the puppet states fostered by Dutch imperialism, in order to weaken Dutch control over Indonesia. Indonesian President Sukarno signed an "emergency law" on the 8th to "clean up" the various political and administrative units within Indonesia, stipulating that the United States of Indonesia will be merged from the original sixteen states into four political units: the Republic of Indonesia, the State of East Sumatra, the Autonomous State of West Borneo, and the Autonomous State of East Indonesia (Celebes and its neighboring islands). As early as January, the puppet leaders of East Java, Madura, and West Java's Pasundan (the location of the "Westerling Affair") were forced to resign one after another under the pressure of the Hatta government, and the Hatta government sent commissioners to take over the government. At the same time, Dutch imperialism is trying to delay its troop withdrawal date in order to maintain its control over Indonesia. According to an Associated Press Jakarta dispatch: Dutch authorities, citing "technical difficulties" as an excuse, announced on the 13th that the scheduled completion date for the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia would be delayed by three months (according to Dutch Prime Minister Drees, who announced last November that Dutch troops stationed in Indonesia would be completely withdrawn within six months after the "transfer of sovereignty" on December 27th, i.e., before the end of June this year). Dutch Deputy Minister of the Army, Andries, said that "most" Dutch troops would be withdrawn from Indonesia before the end of September.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] The so-called "rebellion" conspiracy of the "Westerling troops" orchestrated by Dutch aggressors in West Java on January 23rd to strengthen their control over Indonesia has temporarily ended under the pressure of American imperialism. According to United Press and Associated Press reports: Westerling "fled" from Indonesia to Singapore on the night of February 22nd aboard a Dutch naval aircraft, and on February 26th, the British authorities in Singapore "arrested" him for illegal entry. The day after the "Westerling Affair" broke out (January 25th), the US State Department immediately exerted pressure on the Netherlands, believing that "the nature of the disturbances was very serious" and threatening that the United Nations Indonesian Commission, which is controlled by the United States, was ready to "assist" in this situation at any time (United Press). At the same time, the Dutch aggressors who instigated the "rebellion" partially achieved their conspiracy to strengthen control over the Indonesian army and its government, as the Hatta government had agreed on February 4th to "reorganize the Dutch-Indonesian army and security units as soon as possible" (Aneta News Agency). In order to avoid causing American intervention, the Dutch aggressors temporarily withdrew and planned Westerling's "escape."
    The Indonesian government had requested the British authorities to extradite Westerling, but the British authorities in Singapore refused, announcing that Westerling would be "deported" after one month in prison, effectively sending him back to the Netherlands. According to Agence France-Presse citing Singapore sources, Westerling has been placed under the protection of the Dutch consulate.

　　荷帝拖延撤兵日期
    力图继续控制印尼
    哈达依靠美帝压迫小傀儡邦  印尼“威斯特灵事件”暂告收场
    【新华社十八日讯】以美国帝国主义为靠山的印尼哈达政府与荷兰帝国主义之间的矛盾日益明显。据雅加达消息：印尼政府已展开解消由荷兰帝国主义所扶植的傀儡邦的运动，以削弱荷兰对印尼的控制力量。印尼合众国总统苏加诺已于八日签署一项“清理”印尼内部各政治与行政单位的“紧急法”，规定印尼合众国将由原有的十六邦合并为四个政治单位，即：印尼共和国、苏东邦（东苏门答腊）、西婆罗洲自治邦及东印尼自治邦（西里伯斯及其邻近各岛）。而早在一月间，东爪哇、马都拉和“威斯特灵事件”的爆发地点西爪哇巴巽丹三邦的傀儡首长，即已在哈达政府的压力下被迫先后辞职，由哈达政府派出专员前往接管政权。与此同时，荷兰帝国主义正力图拖延其撤兵日期，以保持其对印尼的控制力量。据美联社雅加达讯：荷兰当局以“技术困难”为借口，十三日宣布从印尼撤退荷兰驻军的预定完成日期，将延迟三个月（按荷兰总理德里斯曾于去年十一月宣布，驻印尼的荷军定于十二月二十七日“移交主权”后六个月内，即今年六月底以前撤完）。荷兰陆军部副部长安德里斯称：“大多数”荷军将在九月底以前撤出印尼。
    【新华社十八日讯】荷兰侵略分子为加强控制印尼而于一月二十三日在西爪哇策动的所谓“威斯特灵部队”的“叛乱”阴谋，已在美帝国主义压力下暂告收场。据合众社、美联社消息：威斯特灵已于二月二十二日夜乘荷兰海军飞机，由印尼“逃”往新加坡，二月二十六日新加坡英国当局以非法入境罪加以“逮捕”。在“威斯特灵事件”爆发后第二天（一月二十五日），美国国务院即出面向荷兰施用压力，认为“骚乱的性质非常严重”，并扬言为美国一手控制的联合国印尼委员会，准备随时对这种情势加以“协助”（合众社）。同时策动“叛变”的荷兰侵略分子，因哈达政府在二月四日已同意“尽早改编荷印军与保安大队”（安尼塔社），部分达到了加强控制印尼军队及其政府的阴谋。为避免引起美国的干涉，荷兰侵略分子乃暂时收场，并为威斯特灵策划“逃跑”之计。
    印尼政府曾要求英国当局引渡威斯特灵，但新加坡英国当局已予拒绝，宣布威斯特灵监禁一个月后“应予驱逐出境”，实际上是把他送回荷兰。据法新社引新加坡消息称：威斯特灵已被置于荷兰领事馆的保护下。
