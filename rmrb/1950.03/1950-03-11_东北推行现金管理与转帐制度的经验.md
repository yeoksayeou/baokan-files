　　Northeast's Experience in Implementing Cash Management and Transfer System
    Northeast accepted the Soviet experience and began implementing the cash management and transfer system in April 1949. Over the past year, it has achieved great results, which are worth learning from its experience and lessons.
    In the spring of 1949, Northeast had basically entered a period of peaceful construction. At that time, in order to restore production, it was necessary to continue investing. At that time, transactions between public enterprises had to be done in cash, so a large number of banknotes had to be issued. Before March, prices had risen by 60 percent. For this reason, Northeast decided to issue public bonds and implement cash management, and organize three centers. Under the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee, a General Accounting Bureau was established. This General Accounting Bureau is the center for internal transfer and the center for supplying funds. The Industrial Department also has an accounting bureau to carry out internal transfers. On the other hand, cash management measures were promulgated, clearly stipulating that cash must be deposited in the Northeast Bank, and the bank has become the cash center.
    After the implementation of cash management and transfer system in Northeast, it has had great gains: First, due to cash management, most of the funds were deposited in the bank. Before this, the Northeast Bank mobilized only 2 trillion in deposits through business means. However, since the implementation of cash management, cash must be returned, and deposits reached more than 6 trillion in December. These more than 6 trillion were mostly supplied to the General Accounting Bureau for investment in production. Without cash management, if these more than 6 trillion of funds did not return to the bank, more banknotes would have to be issued to invest in production. Second, due to the promotion of the transfer system, the General Accounting Bureau's transfer was six times the amount of cash. If there were no transfers at all, six times more cash would be needed, which would undoubtedly increase issuance. According to the report of Zhu Lizhi, Director of the General Accounting Bureau, it can be said that one yuan is used as six yuan. Third, the Northeast Bank specially selected the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Railways, the General Post Office, the General Taxation Bureau, the Monopoly Bureau, and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which have the largest cash income and expenditure, to deeply establish contracts for agency collection and payment, and agency remittance and settlement. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company completely abolished more than 40 large and small treasuries, and the bank directly acted as an agent for collection and payment. The bank has become the general cashier of these state-owned enterprises. Anshan Iron and Steel Company saved hundreds of people by canceling the large treasury, and more than 40 small treasuries, saving a total of hundreds of cashier personnel. The Anshan office of the Northeast Bank only used a dozen people to handle these tasks, including the payment of salaries for 36,000 people. Because the Anshan office controlled the cash and promoted transfers, the transfer was 32 times the amount of cash in November. This is a very successful attempt. The contracts signed by the Northeast Bank are basically of two types: One type is to sign contracts with currency recovery departments and use the agency general treasury method to quickly concentrate cash in the central cities of Northeast, such as the income of the financial department, and the income of the commercial, transportation, and public utility departments, which is the basic way for the state to recover currency, and the agency general treasury can achieve the work of managing cash and concentrating cash in one fell swoop. This helps the finances a lot, ensuring that no additional currency is issued due to poor reflux. One type is to sign contracts with large industrial units with more cash payments, such as signing contracts with Anshan Iron and Steel Company, acting as an agent treasury, and performing cashier duties. The bank can save cash as much as possible in the actual process, promote transfers, and control funds. Grasp the departments with high income with one hand, and grasp the departments with high expenditure with the other. This key in-depth approach is worth learning.
    Vice Chairman Li Fuchun believes that the promotion of cash management, the transfer system, and public bonds greatly contribute to the stability of prices in Northeast. Prices have basically entered stability since April. On the other hand, the funds of various enterprises in Northeast have basically no longer been lacking or interrupted. Therefore, the result of Northeast's promotion basically achieved the role of expanding investment and consolidating currency.
    In the process of implementation in Northeast, there are several characteristics and problems that are being discussed. First, the implementation of cash management is gradual. The cash management measures promulgated in March 1949 only stipulated that "the cash held by each unit shall not exceed the prescribed amount (the specific amount shall be separately prescribed by the Financial and Economic Committee according to different periods and different situations.)" Only on November 15, 1949, it was stipulated that "any public enterprise, institution, or cooperative shall not keep cash exceeding the amount of daily expenses within three days of the unit." At the same time, the scope of strict restrictions was limited to Northeast-level organs and enterprises in March 1949, and it was stipulated in November that it should be expanded to the provincial and municipal levels, and all organs, enterprises, and cooperatives are generally bound by cash management. In 1949, because the measures in March were not clearly stipulated, it was easy to have difficulties in implementation. At the same time, there was no sufficient publicity and mobilization beforehand, and no inspection methods were stipulated afterwards. Therefore, even in Shenyang, the First Machinery Factory had never opened an account at the bank until November, and the smelting plant had 420 million yuan in its own inventory, and only 350 million yuan in bank deposits. Therefore, cash management is not comprehensive and has not achieved 100% results. On January 10, 1950, the Northeast People's Government more clearly stipulated that "to strengthen cash management, all cash of all public enterprises and institutions must be deposited in the local Northeast Bank, and no cash shall be retained privately, exceeding the amount of the same day's use (those without a bank in the local area shall not exceed half a month to one month's use), and those who violate it shall be dealt with as financial discipline." Second, the center of the transfer is the General Accounting Bureau. The General Accounting Bureau is the material supply and cash supply center. Therefore, the transfer is not linked to credit, but to supply. The difference transferred down by the bank is a loan, and a credit request must be made in advance, but the General Accounting Bureau does not need this. Therefore, the transfer of the General Accounting Bureau is difficult to predict and is passive. It is only after the account is transferred down that it is known that a certain factory has spent more money. This investment is passive and cannot be planned in advance. The General Accounting Bureau absorbed more than 5 trillion in deposits from the bank and had to pay interest to the bank; however, the enterprises did not pay interest to the Accounting Bureau, and the appropriations did not need to be returned. The Accounting Bureau solved the funds, raw material supply, and finished product sales between the enterprises, and achieved great results. However, the funds invested by the Accounting Bureau cannot be distinguished as long-term investment or short-term credit; the enterprises cannot distinguish whether this is working capital or revolving capital. Therefore, long-term construction tasks and production tasks are not easy to distinguish, which affects the completion and supervision of long-term construction tasks and production tasks. At the same time, the General Accounting Bureau also designed transfer tools, two types, namely, salary coupons and railway transportation checks, and another is the electricity bill check within the Industrial Department. The largest item in the cash expenditure of enterprises in Northeast (about 70% to 80%) is wages. In May 1949, the General Accounting Bureau issued salary coupons, which initially accounted for 60% of the wages, and later reduced to 40%. These salary coupons stipulate that only goods can be purchased in state-owned stores or cooperatives, which is to force currency to be recovered through state-owned stores. Railway freight checks were also issued to the Ministry of Commerce and various factories to pay freight to the Ministry of Railways. Within the Industrial Department, there are also electricity bill checks, which are specifically used to pay electricity bills. These are all specialized transfer tools, which are very helpful for saving cash and saving issuance. However, because the goods in state-owned stores cannot necessarily fully meet the requirements of employees, bathing, hairdressing, and buying vegetables and meat cannot be supplied, so salary coupons are sometimes sold to merchants as a tool to purchase goods from state-owned stores. Therefore, to ensure the completion of the salary coupon task, it is necessary to further develop state-owned commerce to cooperate. The transportation bill and electricity bill checks circulate very smoothly, completing the purpose of saving cash. Third, the settlement in Northeast is three-dimensional. Under the General Accounting Bureau, each department sets up accounting offices to carry out internal settlement, and each bureau sets up accounting offices to carry out internal settlement. For example, if a bill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company needs to be cleared, it must go through the accounting office of the Iron and Steel Enterprise Administration Bureau, and then be transferred from the bureau to the accounting office of the department, and then transferred from the department to the General Accounting Bureau, which often takes three or several months, because the Accounting Bureau has no agencies in various places and cannot carry out flat settlement. (There are still some liquidation bureaus in the industrial departments of the Soviet Union's transfer, but they are not enterprise units, but institutions for preliminary liquidation.)
    The achievements of cash management in Northeast are very huge, and it has played a great role in consolidating finance, stabilizing prices, absorbing funds, and investing in production. In January 1950, Northeast further abolished the General Accounting Bureau, and the Northeast Bank will bear the task of the entire cash center, transfer center, and credit center. This will accept the experience of the General Accounting Bureau and further strengthen cash management and the transfer system. From the experience of one year of implementation, Northeast has realized that this is the path that the New Democratic Bank should take, from the free deposit of banks and enterprises to the mandatory deposit and credit, so Northeast believes that this is an important reform of the credit system and enterprise management, not a simple measure.

　　东北推行现金管理与转帐制度的经验
    东北接受了苏联的经验，自一九四九年四月开始实行现金管理和转帐制度，一年以来，有了极大的成绩，很值得我们来学取其经验与教训。
    东北在一九四九年春天，已基本上进入和平建设，当时为了要恢复生产，势须继续投资，当时公营企业之间的买卖，都要用现金，因此要发大量票子。在三月以前物价上涨了百分之六十。为此东北便决定发行公债，和实施现金管理，组织三种中心。东北财经委员会之下，成立了总会计局。这个总会计局，是内部转帐的中心，同时又是供给资金的中心。工业部内部又有会计局，进行内部转帐。另一方面颁布了现金管理办法，明确规定了现金必须存入东北银行，银行已经成为现金中心。
    东北推行现金管理和转帐制度以后，便有极大的收获：第一、由于现金管理，大部资金存到了银行。在这以前东北银行用业务的方式，动员来的存款不过二万亿。但是自实施现金管理后，现金必须回笼，十二月份存款达六万余亿。这六万余亿大都供给总会计局投入生产。如果没有现金管理，这六万亿头寸不回到银行来，势将多发行以投资生产。第二、由于转帐制度推行，总会计局转帐为现金的六倍，假定完全不转帐的话，便要多用六倍的现金，这无疑的要增加发行。据总会计局朱理治局长报告，这可以说是一元顶了六元用。第三、东北银行特别选择了现金收入最多的商业部、铁道部、邮电总局、税务总局、专卖总局和开支最大的鞍山钢铁公司，深入的订立了代理收付、代理汇解的合同。如鞍山钢铁公司，大小金库四十几个完全取消，由银行直接代理收付。银行成为这些国家企业的总出纳。鞍山钢铁公司取消了大金库省下一百多人，小金库四十几个，总共节省了出纳人员好几百人。东北银行鞍钢办事处仅用十几个人，便代理了这些工作，包括了代发三万六千人的薪水。由于鞍办掌握了现金，推行转帐，十一月份，转帐为现金的三十二倍。这是非常成功的尝试。东北银行所订合同基本上有两类：一类是替货币回笼部门订合同、运用代理总金库的方式，迅速集中现金到东北的中心城市，如财政部门的收入，和商业、运输，公用部门的收入，是国家收回货币的基本方式，代理总金库，一举达到管理现金与集中现金的工作。这对财政帮助很大，保证不致因回流不畅增发通货。一类是替现金支付较多的大工业单位如与鞍钢订立合同，代理金库，执行出纳，银行可以在实际过程中，尽量节省现金，推行转帐，掌握资金。一手抓住收入多的部门，一手抓住支出较多的部门。这种重点深入的做法，值得学习。
    李富春副主席认为现金管理，转帐制度和公债之推行大有助于东北物价之稳定，物价自四月以后即基本上进入安定。另一方面东北各企业的资金，基本上便再没有缺乏或中断的情形了。因此，东北推行的结果，基本上达到了扩大投资和巩固货币的作用。
    东北实施的过程中，有几个特点与问题，正在进行研讨。第一、现金管理的实施，是逐步的。在一九四九年三月颁布的现金管理办法中，仅规定“各单位所存现款，不得超过规定数目（具体数目由财经委员会按不同时期不同情况分别规定之。）”一九四九年十一月十五日才规定“任何公营企业机关合作社自己保存现金不得超过该单位三天内日常开支金额。”同时受严格约束的范围，一九四九年三月份规定只限于东北一级机关、企业，十一月份才规定扩大到省市一级，受现金管理一般约束的是全部机关、企业、合作社。一九四九年由于三月份的办法没有明白规定，执行的时候，便易生困难。同时事前未经充分的宣传与动员，事后也没有规定检查的办法。因此即在沈阳，到十一月份第一机械厂竟从来没在银行开过户头，冶炼厂自己库存四亿二千万元，银行存款仅三亿五千万元。因此现金管理不是全面的，尚未收百分之百的成绩。到一九五○年一月十日，东北人民政府更明确规定“加强现金管理，所有一切公营企业及机关现金均须存在当地东北银行，不得私自保留现金，超过当日的使用量（当地无银行者，不得超过半月到一月之使用量）违者以财政纪律议处。”第二、转帐的中心在总会计局，总会计局是物资供应现金供应中心，因此转帐没有与信贷联系，而与供给联系。银行转下来差额是贷款，必须事先进行信贷请求，而总会计局却无需乎此。因此总会计局的转帐是难以预计的，是被动的，转下帐来才知道某厂是多用了钱，这种投资是被动的，无法事前计划的。总会计局向银行吸收了五万多亿存款，要付利息给银行；但是各企业并不向会计局付息，拨款也无需乎归还。会计局解决了各企业间的资金，原料供给，与成品推销，有很大的成绩。但是会计局所投入资金，无法分出是长期投资，还是短期信贷；各企业单位也无法分辨这是流动资金抑是周转资金。因此长期建设任务与生产任务，便不易分清，影响了长期建设任务与生产任务的完成与监督，同时总会计局又设计转帐工具，有二种，即是工薪券和铁路运输支票，另一种是工业部内部的电费支票。东北各企业现金支出之中最大的项目（约为百分之七十至八十）是工资。一九四九年五月总会计局发行工薪券，在工资中最初占百分之六十，后来减为百分之四十。这工薪券规定只准在国营商店或合作社买货，这是强制通货经国营商店回笼。又发行了铁路运费支票，给商业部及各工厂作为运费付给铁道部。在工业部内部又有电费支票，专付电费。这都是专门的转帐工具，对于节省现金节省发行，很有帮助。但是由于国营商店的货色不一定能完全满足职工要求，要洗澡理发要买青菜肉类都还不能供应，因此工薪券有时被卖到商人手中，作为向国营商店套购物资的工具。因此保证工薪券之完成任务，尚须国营商业进一步的发展加以配合。运费支票与电费支票流通非常顺利，完成了节省现金的目的。第三、东北的结算是立体式的，总会计局之下，各部设立会计处进行内部结算，各局又设立会计处进行内部结算。例如鞍钢一笔帐要清算，必须经过钢铁企业管理局的会计处，由局再转部的会计处，由部转总会计局，时间往往三几月，因为会计局在各地无机构，不能平面的进行结帐。（苏联的转帐，也还存在一些工业部门的清算局，但不是企业单位，而是进行初步清算的机构。）
    东北推行现金管理的成绩，是非常巨大的，对巩固金融，安定物价，吸收资金，投资生产，起了很大作用。一九五○年一月东北更进一步，取消总会计局，由东北银行负担整个的现金中心、转帐中心、信贷中心的任务，这将接受总会计局的经验，进一步的强化现金管理与转帐制度。东北由一年执行的经验，已体会到这才是新民主主义银行应走的途径，由银行与企业的自由往来存款，变为强制的存现与信贷，因此东北认为这是信贷制度企业管理的重要改革，不是一件简单的措施。（转载银行月刊）
