[This newspaper reported] Song Luoxue, a farmer from Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, and a model Communist Party member, recently sent a letter to this newspaper in response to the call of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to ensure the completion of the cotton and grain production increase plan, reporting his new plan to increase grain production this year. Comrade Song Luoxue was awarded the Model Communist Party Member Certificate by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (when Mancheng was formerly under the jurisdiction of Chahar Province) and the Production Model Medal by the Chahar Provincial People's Government and the Mancheng County People's Government. His plan is well-formulated and worthy of study by everyone. This newspaper asks Comrade Song Luoxue to regularly inform us of the progress of production in Songjia Village and the problems in local production in the future. The letter, with minor changes to individual words and sentences, is as follows:
To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

I am Song Luoxue from Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province. I am a Communist Party member. I attended the provincial economic conference in January, listened to Chairman Yang's report, and also participated in the labor hero model symposium held by the Provincial Party Committee. This meeting made me understand that if we want to build the country well, we must develop production. I further realized that production work is more important than anything else. Recently, the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of our Party called for ensuring the completion of the government's cotton and grain production increase plan. I resolutely respond to the call of the higher authorities and am determined to lead the peasants to do a good job in production.

We have already held branch party member meetings, plenary cadre meetings, and mass meetings in the village to publicize various policies to encourage production and the production increase guidelines for 1950, which has raised the production enthusiasm of the masses in the whole village. Now every household in our village is making a production increase plan for 1950. I also first convened a family meeting and formulated this year's production increase plan.

My family has six people, my wife and four children. The eldest child is eighteen years old this year, the second is twelve years old, and the other two are under four years old. In total, we have two male laborers and one female laborer. We cultivate 18.6 mu of land (including 7.7 mu of irrigated land) and jointly raise a donkey with my brother. We feed two pigs. We share a large cart with others and have a weaving machine and a spinning wheel each.

The allocation of crops: we plant 6 mu of cotton, 2 mu of Chinese yam, 1 mu of peanuts, 4 mu of millet (including 2 mu of Japanese millet), 4 mu of corn (planting 2 mu of Mayab corn), and the remaining 0.6 mu is planted with vegetables. We choose good varieties to plant.

Choose good seeds, apply more fertilizer, dig wells and ditches, plow and hoe more, and improve technology.

Fertilization: In order to accumulate more fertilizer, we opened a vermicelli workshop at the beginning of last winter and fed three large pigs. Later, because the vermicelli could not be sold, I changed careers after returning from the meeting and organized a wood factory to make agricultural tools and earn money to buy sesame cakes to feed the pigs. In any case, we must ensure that we feed two large pigs all year round. And we diligently feed the pigs and pad the pens to ensure that we accumulate more than 160 carts of fertilizer in the spring. We have already transported 85 carts to the fields (cotton, peanut, and yam fields). The average is 8.5 carts of fertilizer per mu. Each mu exceeds the normal amount by 4.5 carts (according to the statistics of 1947, 1948, and 1949, an average of 75 carts of fertilizer were accumulated each year, only 4 carts per mu).

Expand the area of water conservancy: The wells in my field are deep and small, and waterwheels cannot be used. Now I am preparing to dig a well with my neighbor Song Luoqin and others, according to one waterwheel. Expand the original 7.7 mu of paddy fields by one mu. And clear the bottom of the 156-zhang drainage ditch of the four neighboring households to prevent floods.

Achieve intensive cultivation and careful work: All the land has been serially plowed, cultivated, and harrowed once after last autumn, but this spring it will still be serially plowed and harrowed once, so that moisture can be preserved. Ensure that all land is cultivated three times and harrowed four times, and ensure that cotton is hoeed six times and repaired in a timely manner. Yam (irrigated land) nine times, peanuts twice, millet four times, corn three or four times, and three mu of dry wheat is hoeed twice. Three mu of irrigated wheat, irrigated and hoeed three times each. The technique of hoeing should also be improved a step further.

Prevention and control of diseases and insect pests: In order to improve seeds and prevent the occurrence of diseases and insect pests, field selection of seeds is carried out for various crops. Especially for cotton, large, white cotton flowers with five petals should be selected in the field to further improve the quality of cotton. When sowing, ensure that corn and millet are soaked 100% using the "two openings and one cooling" method. Regularly check the fields, and eliminate insect eggs immediately when they are found. If diseases are found, treat and prevent them in time to reduce the occurrence and spread of diseases. And when harvesting in autumn, various crops are selected in the field to gradually improve the seeds.

According to the above methods, if there are no unexpected disasters, my family's harvest will exceed any previous year.

The output of various crops should exceed the normal year.

Estimate: Each mu of cotton can produce more than 160 jin (a total of 1,000 jin from six mu), exceeding the normal year by 60 jin per mu. Six mu can produce 1,000 jin of cotton, equivalent to 330 jin of ginned cotton (exceeding the normal year by 132 jin), 55 jin of ginned cotton per mu (exceeding the normal year by 21 jin), exceeding the requirement of 29 jin. Each mu of peanuts can produce 500 jin, the same as last year. Each mu of wheat can produce 128 jin, increasing by 16 jin per mu compared to the normal year. Each mu of Chinese yam can produce 2,500 jin, exceeding the normal year by 1,300 jin per mu. Each mu of Japanese millet can produce 260 jin, exceeding the normal year by 73 jin per mu. Each mu of corn can produce 245 jin, exceeding the normal year by 51 jin per mu (the so-called normal year refers to the three years of 1947, 1948, and 1949). If crops such as yam and peanuts are converted into grain, four jin of yam are converted into one jin of grain, and one jin of peanuts produces eleven liang of kernels, and each jin of kernels is exchanged for one and a half jin of grain, the annual grain production can reach 4,975 jin, an increase of 1,590 jin compared to the normal year (normal year production is 3,385 jin), equivalent to an increase of 132 jin per mu compared to the normal year.

In addition, all family members have also made their own plans. My wife makes clothes, spins, weaves, and feeds pigs. She saves firewood for daily burning, ensures that no one is hired, and participates in picking cotton and harvesting in autumn. The eldest son transports more than 300 carts of soil for making adobe and padding pens. And he helps others, pressing two circles (20 carts) of green manure in summer.

The whole family is harmonious, united in production, and fully uses large and small labor forces, and leads the masses to produce.

A plan inspection system has also been established. Starting from February, a family meeting is held once a month to check the degree to which each person has implemented the plan, and to conduct criticism and commendation to achieve family harmony and united production. If there are no unexpected disasters this year, we will build three new houses next year and gradually move towards a life of plenty. My responsibility is to also lead the masses to produce. I have now helped seven households make family plans and led more than 30 households to make plans. I believe that under the leadership of the People's Government and the Party, we can complete the production increase plan and live a good life.

　　河北满城生产模范宋洛学
    响应政府和党的号召  来函报告增产新计划
    深耕细作保证今年增产粮食千五百余斤
    宣传与组织群众家家户户订计划
    【本报讯】河北省满城县宋贾村农民，模范共产党员宋洛学，最近致函本报，响应中央人民政府与中共中央保证完成棉粮增产计划的号召，报告自己今年增产粮食的新计划。宋洛学同志在满城前属察哈尔省的时候，曾获察哈尔省中共党委模范共产党员奖状、察哈尔省人民政府与满城县人民政府生产模范奖章。他的这个计划订得很好，值得大家学习。本报要求宋洛学同志今后经常把宋贾村生产进行情形和当地生产中的问题告诉我们。来信除个别字句稍有更改外，全文如下：人民日报编辑部：
    我是河北省满城县宋贾村人，我是共产党员。我一月里参加了省里的经济会议，听了杨主席的报告，又参加了省委召开的劳动英雄模范座谈会。这会议使我明白了要想把国家建设好，非发展生产不行，更进一步认清了生产工作比什么都重要。最近中央人民政府和我党中央又号召保证政府棉粮增产计划完成，我坚决响应上级号召，决心领导农民把生产搞好。
    我们已在村里召开了支部党员大会、全体干部会议和群众大会，宣传了奖励生产的各种政策和一九五○年的增产方针，提高了全村群众的生产情绪。现在我村家家户户在作一九五○年的增产计划。我并首先召开了家庭会议，订出了今年的增产计划。
    我家六口人，我与老婆和四个孩子，大孩今年十八岁，二的十二岁，那两个都四岁以下。共合两个男劳动力，一个女劳动力。种地十八亩六分（内有水浇地七亩七分），与我兄弟合养一头驴。喂两口猪。与人家伙有大车一辆，织布机纺车各一。
    作物的分配：种二比棉六亩，洋山药二亩，花生一亩，谷子四亩（内有日本谷二亩），棒子（即玉米）四亩（种二亩马芽棒子），剩下的六分地种菜。都选优良品种种。
  选好种，多施肥，打井挖沟，多耕多锄，改良技术。
    施肥：为了多积肥，去年冬初就开了粉房，喂大猪三个。后因粉条卖不出去，我开会回来就转业组织了一个木厂，作农具，赚钱买麻饼喂猪。无论如何要保证常年喂着两个大猪。并且勤喂猪勤垫圈，保证春天积肥一六○多车。现在已运到地里（棉、花生、山药地）八十五车了。平均每亩上肥八车半。每亩超过常年四车半（据一九四七、四八、四九年三年统计，平均每年共积肥七十五车，每亩只四车）。
    扩大水利面积：我地里的井深又小，水车用不上，现在和地邻宋洛勤等联合准备打井一眼，按水车一辆。把原有七亩七分水田扩大一亩。并把四家地邻的一百五十六丈泄水沟清底，以防水患。
    作到精耕细作：全部土地已在去年秋后串（即耠）、耕、耙了各一遍，但是今春还是要串、耙一遍，这样可以保存水分。保证全部土地作到耕三耙四，并保证棉锄六遍，修理适时。山药（水浇地）九遍、花生二遍、谷四遍、玉米三四遍，三亩旱麦锄二遍。三亩水麦，浇锄各三遍。锄地技术也要提高一步。
    防除病虫害：为了改良种子和防止病虫害的发生，各种作物都进行田间选种。特别是棉花，要在田间选五个瓣的大朵白棉花，使棉花质量更加提高。下种时，保证玉米、谷子百分之百用两开一凉的方法浸种。常到地里检查，发现虫卵，马上消灭。发现病害及时治防，减少病发生和传延。并在收秋时，各种庄稼都在田间选种，使种子逐渐改良。
    照以上作法，如无意外灾害，我家的收成将超过以往任何一年。
    各种作物产量，都要超过常年。
    估计：每亩棉花可产一百六十多斤（六亩共产一千斤），每亩超常年六○斤。六亩共产棉一千斤，合皮棉三百三十斤（超常年一三二斤），每亩出皮棉五五斤（超常年二一斤），超过二十九斤的要求。每亩花生可产五○○斤，与去年同。每亩麦子可产一二八斤，每亩比常年增产一六斤。每亩洋山药可产二五○○斤，每亩超常年一三○○斤。每亩日本谷可产二六○斤，每亩超常年七三斤。每亩棒子可产二四五斤，每亩超常年五一斤（所说常年是指一九四七、四八、四九年三年）。如果把山药、花生等作物都折成粮食，山药四斤折粮一斤，花生一斤出仁十一两，每斤仁换粮食一斤半，全年可产粮四千九百七十五斤，比常年增产（常年产三三八五斤）一五九○斤，合每亩比常年增一三二斤。
    除此外，全家人也都各作了自己的计划，我老婆做衣服，纺花织布喂猪，日常烧柴要节省，保证不雇人，并参加摘棉花、秋收。大儿自己运打坯、垫圈的土三百多车。并与别人互助，在夏季压绿肥两圈（二十车）。
  全家和气，团结生产，大小劳动力充分使用，并带动群众生产。
    还规定了检查计划制度，从二月份起每月开家庭会一次，检查每个人实行计划的程度，进行批评表扬，达到全家和气，团结生产。如果今年无意外灾害，明年盖三间新房，逐渐走向丰衣足食。我的责任还要把群众带动起来生产。现在已帮助七户作出了家庭计划并带动三十多户作出计划。我相信在人民政府和党的领导下，我们能完成增产计划，过好日子。
        满城县宋贾村  宋洛学
