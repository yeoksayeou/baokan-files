　　Irrational Use of Elementary School Textbooks: Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education Has Initially Corrected It
　　Letter from Elementary School Students' Parents Editor:
　　We are the parents of elementary school students, and our children are all studying in junior elementary school. Since liberation, the school has been doing a great job in all aspects, but the distribution of textbooks is somewhat unreasonable. For example, last semester, they were supposed to study Books 1, 3, 5, and 7, but they were given Books 1, 4, 6, and 8. It was originally autumn and winter, but the first volume of the national language textbook was all about spring and summer. The arithmetic for the second, third, and fourth grades was even more unsuitable for the children's level. We asked the teachers about this, but their answers varied. For example, the principal said: This is a unified city-wide regulation. Some teachers said: The higher authorities are asking us to study it, and it will be changed later. Some teachers also said: This has been researched by many experts and is guaranteed to be correct. Although we were still very suspicious, we felt that it could be changed for the next semester, so we didn't mention it again. But we didn't expect that the beginning of this semester would be even more confusing. At first, we were asked to buy Books 2, 5, 7, and the new Book 8, but in less than two days, we were asked to exchange them for Books 2, 3, 5, and 7. Originally, it was for spring and summer, but the books talked about north winds and ice and snow. When we asked the school, the school authorities replied with "order from the Bureau." This not only makes the content inconsistent with reality, but also makes students in the second, third, and fourth grades take a step backward, and it is even unclear whether the fourth graders can graduate. We have always been very concerned about our children's education, but we are really laymen in these matters, so we have to ask you to answer the following:
　　(1) Beijing is undergoing large-scale construction in various fields and making rapid progress. Educational work is also being emphasized. But why are elementary school textbooks still so chaotic? Especially since Beijing is an ancient cultural capital with hundreds of thousands of elementary school students, why is no one paying attention to this matter?
　　(2) What are the standards for printing and distributing elementary school textbooks in Beijing? What is the basis for the experts' research? Is this considered following the mass line?
　　(3) Will we still study Books 1, 4, 6, and 8 next semester? If this continues (it has already been a year), it will really harm the children.
　　These things are really incomprehensible. Some parents and teachers we know are not very satisfied. I am afraid this has become a regret for the entire elementary school community!
　　Several Elementary School Students' Parents
　　Reply from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Education
　　We recently received a letter from several elementary school students' parents, inquiring about the regulations regarding elementary school textbooks. Here are the answers to the inquiries:
　　(1) Elementary schools in this city originally started in the fall. Last semester (i.e., the second half of 1949), junior textbooks should have used Books 1, 3, 5, and 7, and senior textbooks should have used Books 1 and 3. We followed the instructions of the North China Elementary Education Conference and adopted the new textbooks reviewed and approved by the former North China People's Government Ministry of Education. However, the new textbooks were only suitable for classes starting in the spring. In order to adapt to the season, the junior level was changed to Books 1, 4, 6, and 8, generally raising it by one volume, except for the first volume. The senior level still used Books 1 and 3. The new textbooks were compiled based on the original textbooks from the North China Liberated Areas. They are suitable for the rural environment and adapted to the level of older children in rural areas. At first, we only instructed the schools to delete a few lessons in the first volume of the junior level that were not suitable for the season, and kept the other volumes unchanged, neglecting the children's level. Because raising it by one volume is equivalent to moving it forward by one semester, students generally felt that the texts were deep, the new words were many, the workload was heavy (many lessons), and the proportion of rural knowledge was large. For this reason, we organized teachers to study the textbooks, make deletions and additions, and overcome these difficulties. The textbook problem was largely solved.
　　(2) Last semester, in order to finish the textbooks according to the schedule, the teachers had to work very hard, and the students ate a lot of things without digesting them. This semester, i.e., the first half of 1950, after several studies and consultations with various schools, it was decided to correct this. The junior Chinese language textbooks will use Books 2, 3, 5, and 7, and the arithmetic textbooks will still use Books 2, 4, 6, and 8. In this way, the texts may be shallower, so it is necessary to review the textbooks from last semester (senior textbooks will still use Books 2 and 4). The main purpose of doing this is to take care of the children's level so that they can accept and digest it.
　　(3) Next semester (i.e., the second half of 1950), the junior textbooks will use Books 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the senior textbooks will use Books 1 and 3. The content will be deleted, revised, and supplemented to make it suitable for the season and the needs of the city. From then on, our textbooks will be connected with the students' level, and the progress will be unified. The fall semester system will not be changed.
　　Currently, we have not yet compiled a complete set of textbooks. They are all selected from the old liberated areas, and some places are not applicable to large cities. In this transition period, there are bound to be many inappropriate things. Now the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government is studying the editing work. It is hoped that parents and educators who are enthusiastic about education will provide more opinions on elementary school textbooks in order to improve the editing work.

### 小学课本用得不合理  京文教局已初步纠正

专栏：询问与答复

　　小学课本用得不合理  京文教局已初步纠正
    小学生家长的来信编辑先生：
    我们是小学生的家长，自己的几个孩子全在初小读书。解放以后学校各方面办的都挺令人满意，唯课本发行的有些不合理。比如上学期该念一、三、五、七册却发的一、四、六、八册。本来是秋天和冬天，国语第一册却都是说的春夏的事，二、三、四年级的算术就更不合小孩程度了。我们为这事去问过先生，可是其说不一。如校长说：这是全市统一规定。有的先生说：上级正叫我们研究呢，以后要改好的。也有的先生说：这是经过多少专家研究的，保准没错。心里虽然还很怀疑，可是也觉得下学期可以改好了，所以没有再提。但没想到这学期一开学，叫人更闹不清了。起初叫买二、五、七册和新八册书，不到两天又叫另换二、三、五、七册。本来是春夏用的，书上却讲的是北风冰雪之类。问学校，学校当局又以“局方命令”答对。这样不但内容不合实际，并且二、三、四年级学生反倒退了一步，更不知四年级能不能毕业了。我们几个历来是很关心自己子女求学的，对这些事又实在外行，只好求你们答复一下：
    （一）北京各种工作都大兴建设，日进千里，教育工作提得也很高，可是为什么小学课本还这么纷乱呢？特别咱北京是个文化古都，小学生几十万，对这事情为什么没人经心呢？
    （二）到底北京市印发小学课本的标准是什么呢？专家们根据什么研究的呢？这是不是算走群众路线呢？
    （三）下学期是不是还念一、四、六、八册？若再继续下去（已一年了）可真把小孩子们害苦了。
    这些事情实在叫人猜不透，我们所知道的一些家长和先生都不大满意，这恐怕成了全市小学界的遗憾呢！
      几个小学生家长
  北京市人民政府文教局的答复
    近接几位小学生家长来信，询问关于小学课本的规定。现就询问意见解答如下：
    （一）本市小学原为秋季始业，上学期（即一九四九年下半年）初级课本应该用一、三、五、七册，高级应该用一、三册。我们遵照华北小学教育会议的指示，采用了前华北人民政府教育部审订的新课本。但新课本只适用于春季始业的班次。为适应季节，因此初级改用一、四、六、八册，除第一册外，普遍提高一册。高级则仍用一、三册。新课本是根据原华北解放区的课本编成的，它适合农村环境，并适应农村年龄较大儿童的水平。起初我们仅令各校将初级第一册中有几课不合季节者删去，其余各册都不动，忽略了儿童的程度。因为提高一册亦即提前一学期，所以学生普遍感到课文深、生字多、分量重（课数多）、农村知识比重大等困难。为此，我们便组织教师，研究课本，加以删改与补充，克服这些困难。教材问题才大体上得到解决。
    （二）上学期为了按进度讲完课本，就使得教师费劲很大，而学生吃了很多东西没有消化。这学期，即一九五○年上半年，经过几次研究，并征求了各学校的意见，决定纠正，初级国语采用二、三、五、七册，算术仍用二、四、六、八册。这样一来，课文可能浅些，所以要复习上学期的课本（高级课本仍用二、四册）。这样做，主要的为了照顾儿童程度，使他们能够接受和消化。
    （三）下学期（即一九五○年下半年），初级课本用一、三、五、七册，高级用一、三册。内容则加以删改补充，使适合季节及城市需要。从此就会使我们的课本和学生的程度衔接起来，并使进度划一。秋季始业的学制并不变更。
    目前我们还没有编出一套完整的课本，都是从老解放区选来的，有些地方不适用于大城市。在这过渡的时期，难免有许多不适当之处。现在中央人民政府教育部，正在研究编辑工作。尚希热心教育的学生家长及教育界人士，多提供一些对小学课本的意见，以便改进编辑工作。
