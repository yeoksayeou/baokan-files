Mr. Sun Yat-sen's unfulfilled aspirations have been inherited, developed, and victoriously realized by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. However, old China was ravaged and trampled upon for decades by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the traitor of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, colluding with imperialism. Today, the revolution has just been victorious, and the war has not yet completely ended. There are still many difficulties in the future. We should continue to fight under the call of "complete victory to consolidate victory," strive to support the front, strive to liberate Taiwan and Tibet quickly, complete the liberation of all of China, work hard to overcome financial and economic difficulties, restore and develop production, and move towards the bright future of building a new China. Representatives from all walks of life delivered speeches one after another. Shao Hengqiu, Standing Committee member of the Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, in his speech, on behalf of the democratic parties in Nanjing, strongly condemned the crimes of the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek for betraying Mr. Sun Yat-sen and poisoning the people.

Zhang Kai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, stated in his speech: We must step up preparations to liberate Taiwan in order to complete the glorious task of finally eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandits. Gao Jun, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union, Chen Minzhi, professor of Nanjing University, Wang Ziyu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other representatives of various groups stated: They will respond to the call of the People's Government, assist the People's Government in overcoming difficulties, build a new Nanjing, and build a new China, to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen with practical actions.
