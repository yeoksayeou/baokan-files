　　Ministry of Agriculture Reports
    Preparation for Spring Plowing Already Showing Results
    All parts of the country, especially the old revolutionary base areas, are actively accumulating manure, repairing water conservancy and agricultural implements, and increasing livestock.
    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government reports: Since last winter, the whole country has universally launched preparations for agricultural production. As of now, all parts of the country, especially in the old liberated areas, have achieved considerable success, making ample preparations for spring plowing and sowing.
    Accumulating Manure and Delivering Fertilizer: Old areas have accepted the task of increasing fertilizer application by 15% this year and have universally launched a manure accumulation campaign. In Changzhi, Yangqu, Yicheng and forty other counties in Shanxi Province, manure accumulation has averaged 32 dan per mu, accounting for 75% of the 1950 manure accumulation plan. Given the seven months remaining until the autumn harvest, the annual plan will be exceeded. In Hebei Province, a mass movement has formed in general areas. Since last winter, Cangxian, Handan, and most counties in Baoding have accumulated more than one large cart of manure per mu. In Shexian, sixty villages have accumulated 3,966,600 dan of manure in two months, enough for two-thirds of the total acreage (30 to 40 dan per mu). Tangyin, Wuzhi, and Linxian counties in Pingyuan Province have also accumulated more than 2.5 million dan. Incomplete statistics from Chahar Province show that 1,184,560 carts have been accumulated. Northern Jiangsu is also actively striving to increase production by 10% this year by accumulating and applying fertilizer. Henggang Township in Sheyang averages 12 dan of lime and ash fertilizer per mu, a fourfold increase compared to the previous year. In the Jiaodong area of Shandong, manure accumulation has become a regular habit for farmers in the Donghai and Beihai regions. Urine is used to water wheat fields. According to statistics from 364 villages, 31,778 mu of wheat fields have been watered. In addition, various regions have paid special attention to organizing urban manure to go to the countryside. For example, the suburbs of Beijing will loan 20 million jin of dried manure from Beijing to farmers. From October to December last year, the Shanghai Suburban Agricultural Preparations Committee helped farmers buy 16,357 carts of manure, reducing intermediate exploitation and increasing the fertilized area by 1,785 mu. In Xinxiang County, Pingyuan Province, masses in the suburbs go to the city to carry manure. The Second District has organized 790 people, each carrying 750 dan. At the same time, manure has been delivered in various regions. Hebei generally completed 70% of deliveries, while Baoding completed 90% or all deliveries.
    Water Conservancy: Whether in old areas, new areas, or disaster areas, the work of repairing canals, digging wells, improving waterwheels, building dikes and embankments, and opening ponds and dams has been universally launched. Shanxi Province has now completed the converging works for the dry and wet embankments of the Fen River, Wenshan Valley River, Xiao River, and Hutuo River. By the end of January, 750,000 mu of land had been winter-watered in the province, reaching 75% of the watering plan. In 72 villages in seven counties including Licheng, 50 new canals of various sizes have been built, exceeding the original plan by 38. In addition, in six counties including Tunliu, 102 waterwheels have been repaired, and 409 wells have been dug. Hebei Province has dug 2,300 new wells, and 1,716 brick kilns are rushing to fire well bricks. 344 waterwheel factories are rushing to manufacture waterwheels, having already produced 17,712 waterwheels. The survey of 14 channels in the three districts of Dingxian, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang has been completed and construction is being studied, striving to start construction in early March. Shandong Province has universally launched mass water conservancy projects and is piloting the Embroidery River Canal and Black Dragon Pool irrigation projects. The former draws water from the Embroidery River to irrigate 37,000 mu of land, while the latter can store 370,000 cubic meters of water and has now been completed, able to irrigate 3,000 mu of land. The first phase of the Shandong Province's Shu and Yi River harnessing project has been completed. The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has undertaken large-scale farmland water conservancy, saving 40,000 mu of good farmland from flooding. The repair of the breached dikes around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province and the Jianghan Dike in Hubei Province has been completed. Jiangxi Province constructed the Anfu Canal, and the entire project was completed at the end of last year, benefiting 13,000 mu of land, with an average annual increase of more than one shi per mu.
    Improving Agricultural Implements: Provinces have made planned, large-scale repairs to agricultural implements. Shanxi Province has universally mobilized the masses to repair them. Statistics from 19 counties including Wutai and Wuxiang show that 100,000 agricultural implements have been completed. The province's supply and marketing cooperative is also using 9 million jin of rice to operate and support the famous Yincheng and Yangquan ironware agricultural implements industries in North China. Statistics from the Huguan area near Yincheng show that the number of large and small furnaces has increased from 5 last year to 34 this year. Chahar Province has manufactured 140,000 agricultural implements. Pingyuan Province is working hard to complete the plan to increase agricultural implements by one million. In 78 villages in the Cangxian and Baoding regions of Hebei Province, iron and wood factories are supported to mobilize the masses to repair agricultural implements, and 6,692 large agricultural implements such as carts, plows, and harrows have been repaired.
    Increasing Livestock: 50 counties including Pingshun and Taigu in Shanxi Province have purchased 11,728 head of cattle, mules, donkeys, and horses. In Qinyang, 21,522 head have been bred and conceived in seven counties. This spring, Shandong Province established 69 public breeding stations and 5 livestock farms with 601 breeding animals, providing mating services for the masses' female livestock at low prices. According to statistics, 33,315 head of female livestock have been mated and 85,284 head of young livestock have been bred in the province.
    Disease Prevention and Control: Wheat yellow dwarf disease is very serious near Baoding in Hebei Province, and the masses have been mobilized to collect diseased seedlings and graze livestock, with great results. In Anci Dabeiyin Village, 220 mu also suffered from yellow dwarf disease, accounting for a quarter of the area. Most of the diseased plants have been collected, and preparations are being made to hoe the wheat immediately after thawing.
    In addition, in disaster areas, attention is being paid to purchasing and lending early-maturing crop seeds and starting sowing. A total of 3 million jin of millet have been issued for spring wheat lending in the disaster areas of Hebei, with 960,000 jin lent to the Cangxian region and 1.15 million jin lent to the Tangshan region. Qingxian, Huanghua, Jianguo, and Wenan counties in the province began to organize mutual assistance between people and animals for sowing before the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, various places are making a concentrated effort to rush planting. Yangliuqing planted 500 mu in two days. To prevent wheat smut disease, agricultural farms in various regions and counties are, as instructed by the provincial government, going to the countryside to guide warm water or chemical disinfection, and this task is nearing completion.

    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部报导：自去冬以来，全国普遍开展了农业生产的准备工作，截至目前，全国各地，尤其在老解放区，已取得不少成绩，为春耕播种作了充分的准备。
    积肥送粪：老区各地均接受今年增施肥料百分之十五的任务，普遍开展了积肥运动。山西省长治、阳曲、翼城等四十三个县，积肥已平均每亩三十二担，占一九五○年积肥计划的百分之七十五。按目前至秋收尚有七个月的积肥时间，全年将超过计划。河北省在一般地区已形成群众运动。自去冬以来沧县、邯郸、保定大部县积肥已超过每亩一大车。涉县六十个村两个月来积肥三百九十六万六千担，够上总亩数的三分之二（每亩三十至四十担）。平原的汤阴、武陟、林县三个县也积了二百五十万担以上。察哈尔省不完全统计已积一百一十八万四千五百六十车。苏北地区也积极为今年增产一成而努力积肥施肥。射阳横港乡平均每亩垩到十二担灰粪，较前年增加四倍。在山东胶东的东海和北海专区积肥已成为农民的常年习惯，并以尿浇麦田，据三百六十四个村的统计，已浇麦田三万一千七百七十八亩。此外各地并特别注意了组织城粪下乡，如京郊即将北京市内的粪干二千万斤贷给农民。上海市郊农筹会自去年十月至十二月帮助农民买大粪一万六千三百五十七车，减轻中间剥削，增加了肥田面积一千七百八十五亩。平原省新乡县市郊群众到城内担粪，二区已组织了七百九十人，每人担七百五十担。同时各地已经送粪，河北各地一般送完百分之七十，保定专区已送完百分之九十或全部。
    水利方面：不论老区新区或灾区，普遍的展开了修渠、打井、增修水车，筑堤筑圩、开塘打坝等水利工作。山西省全省现已完成汾河、文山谷河、潇河、滹沱河的干埝与湿埝的合口工程，至一月底全省冬浇地七十五万亩，已达浇地计划的百分之七十五。黎城等七县七十二个村，新建大小渠五十条，超过原计划三十八条。此外，屯留等六县，修水车一百零二架，打井四百另九眼，河北省已打新井二千三百眼，并有一千七百一十六座砖窑赶烧井砖，三百四十四个水车工厂赶制水车，已制出水车一七七一二辆。定县、保定、石家庄三专区的十四处渠道已勘察完毕，现正研究施工，争取三月上旬施工。山东省各地普遍展开群众性的兴修水利工程，并试办绣惠渠与黑龙潭灌溉工程，前者引绣江河水灌溉，可灌田三万七千亩，后者能蓄水三十七万方公尺，现已完工，能灌田三千亩，该省导沭整沂第一期工程业已完成。浙江省水利局兴办大型农田水利，使四万亩良田免受水灾。湖南省洞庭湖的滨湖溃堤及湖北江汉堤的修整均已完工。江西省兴修安福渠，全部工程，去年年底已经完成，受益田一万三千亩，每亩每年平均可增产一市石余。
    增修农具：各省对于农具，已作有计划的大规模的修置。山西省普遍发动群众修理，该省五台、武乡等十九县统计完成农具十万件。该省供销社并以九百万斤米经营与扶植华北著名的阴城与阳泉铁货农具业，以阴城附近的壶关区的统计看，大小方炉已由去年的五座增到今年三十四座。察哈尔省已制造了十四万件农具。平原省正在为完成增加农具百万件的计划而努力。河北省沧县保定两专区七十八个村扶持铁木工厂发动群众修理农具，已修好大车、犁、耙等大农具六千六百九十二件。
    增殖牲畜：山西省平顺、太谷等五十个县已购买牛、骡、驴、马一万一千七百二十八头。沁阳七县配种受胎者二万一千五百二十二头。山东省今春各地建立公营种畜站六十九处，畜牧场五处，种畜六百零一头，低价为群众母畜交配。全省据已交配母畜三万三千三百一十五头，繁殖幼畜八万五千二百八十四头。
