　　On Self-Criticism
    Stalin
    This article is part of a report made by Stalin at a meeting of activists of the Moscow organization of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on April 15, 1928. The report was entitled "On the Work of the Joint Plenum of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission" and was divided into four parts: (1) On Self-Criticism, (2) The Grain Procurement Problem, (3) The Shakhty Affair, (4) General Conclusions. The full text is published in Volume 11 of Stalin's Collected Works, printed by the Soviet State Publishing Bureau in 1949.
——Editor

    A characteristic of the plenum's work, the discussions at the plenum, and the resolutions of the plenum is the fact that the plenum's work was conducted from beginning to end under the banner of vigorous self-criticism. Not only that, but there was not a single issue at the plenum, not a single speech, that did not include criticism of the shortcomings in our work, and self-criticism of our organizations. Criticism of our shortcomings, honest and Bolshevik self-criticism of the Party, the Soviets, and the economic work organs—this is the general color of the plenum's work.
    I know that there are some people in the Party ranks who generally dislike criticism, especially self-criticism. These people, whom I can call "varnished" communists, often grumble and wave away self-criticism: Hey, it's that damn self-criticism again, exposing our shortcomings again—can't you just let me live in peace? Clearly, these "varnished" communists have nothing in common with the spirit of our Party, with the spirit of Bolshevism. So, because of the existence of this sentiment among those who are far from enthusiastically welcoming self-criticism, we must ask: Do we need self-criticism, where does self-criticism come from, and what are the benefits of self-criticism?
    Comrades, I believe we need self-criticism as much as we need air and water. I believe that without it, without self-criticism, our Party cannot advance, cannot expose our sores, and cannot eliminate our shortcomings. And our shortcomings are still numerous. This must be openly and honestly admitted.
    The slogan of self-criticism cannot be considered a new slogan. It is the foundation of the Bolshevik Party. It is the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Since our country is a country of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and there is only one party leading the dictatorship of the proletariat, namely the Communist Party, which does not and cannot share power with other parties—then, if we want to move forward, shouldn't we expose and correct our own mistakes? Isn't it clear that no one else will expose and correct our mistakes? Isn't it clear, comrades, that self-criticism should be one of the major forces driving us forward?
    The slogan of self-criticism has gained particularly strong development in our Party since the 15th National Congress. Why? Because after the 15th National Congress eliminated the opposition, a new situation was created within the Party that we cannot ignore.
    What is new about the situation? It is that we no longer have, or hardly have, an opposition. It is that because of the ease with which we achieved victory over the opposition, and this (i.e., victory) is in itself a very significant benefit to the Party, there is a danger that complacency, self-righteousness, and a desire to rest on our laurels can develop within the Party. And what does resting on our laurels mean? It means: to bury our forward movement. And in order to prevent this from happening, we need self-criticism, but not the kind of malicious and essentially counter-revolutionary self-criticism conducted by the opposition, but honest, open, and Bolshevik self-criticism.
    The 15th National Congress of our Party recognized this situation and put forward the slogan of self-criticism. Since then, the tide of self-criticism has risen higher and higher, and has left its mark on the work of the April Plenum of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission.
    It would be strange if our enemies, domestic and foreign enemies, used our shortcomings, shouting loudly: Ah, things are not going well with those Bolsheviks. It would be strange if we Bolsheviks were afraid of all this. The strength of Bolshevism lies precisely in the fact that they are not afraid to admit their mistakes. Let the Party, let the Bolsheviks, let all honest workers and laborers in our country expose the shortcomings in our work, the shortcomings in our construction, let them point out the ways to eliminate our shortcomings, so that there will be no more stagnation, poor performance, or corruption in our work and our construction, and so that all our work, all our construction will improve day by day and move from success to success. This is the main thing now. Besides, let the enemies babble about our shortcomings—such small matters cannot and should not embarrass us Bolsheviks.
    Finally, there is another situation that prompts us to conduct self-criticism. I am referring to the issue of the masses and the leaders. Recently, some special relationship between leaders and the masses has begun to form here. On the one hand, a group of leaders has been singled out and historically formed here, and the prestige of these leaders is rising higher and higher, and this group is so high that it is almost unattainable by the masses. On the other hand, the working-class masses, especially the general working masses, are improving very slowly. They are beginning to squint and look up at their leaders from below, and are often afraid to criticize their leaders.
    Of course, the fact that a group of leaders who have risen very high and have great prestige has formed here is in itself a great achievement of our Party. Obviously, it is unimaginable to lead a large country without such a group of prestigious leaders. However, the fact that the leaders leave the masses when they rise, and that the masses begin to look at their leaders from below and dare not criticize them, cannot but create a certain danger of the leaders becoming detached from the masses and the masses leaving the leaders.
    This danger can lead to the result that the leaders become proud and think that everything they do is right. What good can it do if the upper-level leaders become proud and begin to look down on the masses? Obviously, there will be no other result than the destruction of the Party. But we want to move forward and improve our work, not to destroy the Party. It is precisely in order to move forward and improve the relationship between the leaders and the masses that we must constantly open the door to self-criticism, and we must give the Soviet people the possibility to "curse" their leaders, criticize them when they make mistakes, so that the leaders do not become proud and the masses do not leave the leaders.
    Sometimes people confuse the issue of the masses and the leaders with the issue of promoting cadres. Comrades, this is wrong. What is being said here is not about promoting new leaders, although this matter deserves the serious attention of the Party. What is being said here is about preserving the leaders who have already been promoted and have prestige, and establishing a constant and unbreakable link between them and the masses. What is being said here is about organizing the broad public opinion of the Party, the broad public opinion of the working class, through criticism and self-criticism of our shortcomings, as a lively and vigilant spiritual supervision, which highly prestigious leaders, if they want to maintain the trust of the Party and the trust of the working class, should carefully listen to.
    In this sense, the significance of our Party's Soviet newspapers is indeed immeasurable. In this sense, we cannot but welcome the lead taken by *Pravda* in organizing the "Worker-Peasant Inspection Column" to conduct systematic criticism of the shortcomings in our work. However, efforts must still be made to make the criticism serious and profound, and not superficial. In this sense, we should also welcome the lead taken by the *Komsomolskaya Pravda* in boldly and courageously attacking the shortcomings in our work.
    Sometimes people scold critics, saying that their criticism is not perfect, saying that the criticism is sometimes not 100% correct. Often people demand that every point of criticism should be correct, and if the criticism is not correct on every point, they begin to scold and curse.
    Comrades, this is not correct. This is a dangerous mistake. As soon as you try to make this demand, you will shut the mouths of tens of thousands of workers, worker correspondents, and rural correspondents who are willing to correct our shortcomings but sometimes are not good at expressing themselves correctly. This is a dead end, not self-criticism.
    You should know that workers are sometimes a little afraid to tell the truth about the shortcomings in our work. They are a little afraid, not just because they will be "beaten up" for it, but because they are afraid that people will "laugh" at them for not criticizing perfectly. How can ordinary workers and ordinary peasants, who have experienced the shortcomings of our work and our plans in their own lives, logically argue their criticism? If you demand that their criticism be 100% correct, then you will eliminate any possibility of criticism from below, any possibility of self-criticism. So I think that even if the criticism contains only 5% to 10% of the truth, then even this kind of criticism should be welcomed, carefully listened to, and the sound core should be seized. I repeat: otherwise, you will have to shut the mouths of tens of thousands of people who are loyal to the Soviet cause, because they do not yet have enough experience in their criticism work, but the truth itself is coming out of their mouths.
    It is precisely in order not to suppress self-criticism but to develop it, it is precisely for this reason that we must carefully listen to any criticism from the Soviet people, even if this criticism is sometimes not completely correct. Only under these conditions can the masses be convinced that they will not be "beaten up" for imperfect criticism, nor will they be "ridiculed" for some errors in their criticism. Only under these conditions can self-criticism have a true mass character and a true mass appearance.
    It goes without saying that we are not talking about "any kind" of criticism here. The criticism of counter-revolutionaries is also criticism. But the purpose of this criticism is to slander the Soviet regime, destroy our industry, and undermine the work of our Party. Obviously, we are not talking about this kind of criticism here. We are not talking about this kind of criticism, but about criticism from the Soviet people, which aims to improve the organs of the Soviet regime, improve our industry, and improve the work of our Party and trade unions. We need criticism in order to consolidate the Soviet regime, not to weaken it. It is precisely in order to consolidate and improve our cause, it is precisely for this reason, that the Party has issued the slogan of criticism and self-criticism.
    If self-criticism is carried out correctly and honestly, then what do we expect from the slogan of self-criticism in the first place, what results can this slogan give us? This slogan should give us at least two results. First, it should raise the vigilance of the working class, sharpen the attention of the working class to our shortcomings, promote the correction of these shortcomings, and make any "accidents" in our work impossible. Second, it should raise the political consciousness of the working class, develop their sense of ownership of the country, and promote the training of the working class in managing the country.
    Have you noticed that not only the Shakhty affair, but also the grain procurement crisis of January 1928, were "accidents" for many of our comrades? The Shakhty affair is particularly noteworthy in this regard. A group of counter-revolutionary bourgeois experts worked for five years, receiving instructions from anti-Soviet organizations of international capital. For five years, our organizations wrote and issued all kinds of resolutions and instructions. Of course, our coal industry is still rising after all, because the Soviet economic system is so vibrant and powerful that, regardless of our lack of brains and our mistakes, regardless of the destructive work of the experts, our coal industry is still victorious. For five years, this group of counter-revolutionary experts carried out sabotage work in our industry, blowing up boilers, damaging turbines, and so on. But we sat there, safe and sound. As a result, "suddenly," like a bucket of cold water—the Shakhty affair happened.
    Comrades, is this normal? I think this is very abnormal. Holding the helm, opening your eyes and looking, but seeing nothing, until the situation pulls our noses to bump into some disaster—this is not equal to leadership. Bolshevism does not understand leadership in this way. To lead is to foresee. And foreseeing is never an easy thing, comrades.
    It is one thing for a dozen or twenty leading comrades to watch and discover the shortcomings in our work, while the working masses are unwilling or unable to watch and discover the shortcomings. Here, there is every assurance that some shortcomings will be missed and not all shortcomings will be discovered. It is another thing for hundreds of thousands and millions of workers to watch and discover the shortcomings in our work together with a dozen or twenty leading comrades, expose our mistakes, participate in the overall construction effort, and point out ways to improve things. Here, there is more assurance that no accidents will happen, that bad phenomena will be discovered in time, and that measures will be taken in time to eliminate these phenomena.
    We must handle things in such a way that the vigilance of the working class can be developed without being suppressed, so that millions of workers can participate in the common cause of socialist construction, so that millions of workers and peasants, not just a dozen or twenty leaders, can watch the progress of our construction with their eyes wide open, point out our mistakes, and bring them to light. Only under these conditions will there be no "accidents" happening here. But in order to do this, we must develop criticism of our shortcomings from below, we must create mass criticism, and we must accept and implement the slogan of self-criticism.
    Finally, in connection with the implementation of the slogan of self-criticism, on the issue of improving the cultural strength of the working class, on the issue of cultivating the working class's skills in managing the country, Lenin once said:
    "What we lack most—is culture, is the ability to manage. ... The New Economic Policy fully guarantees us the possibility of building the economic foundation of socialism in the economic and political aspects. The question "only" is the cultural strength of the proletariat and its vanguard."
    What does this mean? This means that one of the main tasks of our construction is to cultivate the skills and abilities of the working class to manage the country, manage the economy, and manage industry.
    If we do not give play to the strength and abilities of the workers, if we do not give play to the strength and abilities of the outstanding members of the working class to criticize our mistakes, point out our shortcomings, and promote our work, then can we cultivate these skills and this ability among the working class? Obviously not.
    Then what is needed in order to give play to the strength and abilities of the working class and the general laborers, and to enable them to acquire the skills to manage the country?
    For this, first of all, it is necessary to honestly and Bolshevik-style implement the slogan of self-criticism, to honestly and Bolshevik-style implement the slogan of criticism from below of the shortcomings and errors in our work. What does it mean if workers take advantage of the possibility to openly and directly criticize the shortcomings in the work, improve our work, and promote our work? This means that the workers become active participants in the leadership of the state, the economy, and industry. And this cannot but raise the workers' sense of ownership of the country, raise their enthusiasm, their vigilance, and their culture.
    The issue of the cultural strength of the working class is one of the decisive issues. Why? Because among all the ruling classes that have existed so far, the working class, this ruling class, occupies a somewhat special and not very favorable position. All the classes that have occupied the ruling position so far—slave owners, landlords, capitalists—were also wealthy classes at the same time. They had the possibility to teach their children the knowledge and skills necessary for management. The working class differs from these classes in that it is a poor class, it did not have the possibility to teach its children the knowledge and skills for management in the past, and it has only now, after acquiring political power, acquired this possibility.
    This is among the reasons why the issue of our cultural revolution is so urgent. It is true that the Soviet working class has achieved more in this area in its ten years of rule than the landlords and capitalists did in a hundred years. But the international and domestic situation is such that the achievements we have made are far from enough. Therefore, all means that can raise the level of development of the cultural strength of the working class, all means that can facilitate the cultivation of the skills and abilities of the working class to manage the country and industry—all such means, we should make the most of.
    But from all the above, it can be concluded that the slogan of self-criticism is one of the most important means of developing the cultural strength of the proletariat and cultivating the management skills of the working class. From this comes another reason why the implementation of the slogan of self-criticism is a vital task for us.
    Generally speaking, these are the reasons that require us to treat the slogan of self-criticism as an urgent slogan.
    Therefore, it is not surprising that the work of the April Plenum of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission was carried out under the banner of self-criticism.

### 论自我批评

　　论自我批评
    斯大林
    本文系斯大林一九二八年四月十五日在联共（布）莫斯科组织的积极分子会议上所作的报告的一部分。该报告题名为“论中央委员会和中央监察委员会联合全会底工作”，共分四部分：（一）论自我批评，（二）粮食采办问题，（三）沙赫亭事件，（四）总的结论。全文载苏联国家出版局一九四九年印行的斯大林全集第十一卷。               
               ——编者
    全会工作中的特点，全会讨论和全会决议的特点，就是这个事实：全会的工作从始到终是在激烈的自我批评的标志下进行的。不仅如此，在全会上没有一个问题，没有一次发言，是不带有对我们工作缺点的批评，不带有我们组织的自我批评的。对我们缺点的批评，诚实的和布尔什维克的对党、对苏维埃、对经济工作机关的自我批评——这就是全会工作的一般色彩。
    我知道，在党的队伍中有些人一般不喜欢批评，尤其不喜欢自我批评。这些人，我可以称之为“涂了漆的”共产党员，时常咕噜着，挥开自我批评：嘿，又是这该死的自我批评，又是揭露我们的缺点——可不可以让我安静地活下去呢？显然地，这些“涂了漆的”共产党员与我们党的精神、与布尔什维主义的精神是毫无共同之处的。于是，由于那些远不热忱欢迎自我批评的人们有了这种情绪存在，所以我们便要问一问：我们是否需要自我批评，自我批评是从什么地方来的，而且自我批评有什么好处？
    同志们，我认为我们需要自我批评，就像需要空气和水一样。我认为：没有它，没有自我批评，我们党就不能前进，就不能揭露我们的脓疮，就不能消灭我们的缺点。而我们的缺点还很多。这是必须公开和诚实地承认的。
    自我批评口号不能算作新的口号。它是布尔什维克党的基础。它是无产阶级专政统治的基础。既然我国是无产阶级专政的国家，而领导无产阶级专政的则只有一个党，即共产党，共产党是不把而且不能把政权分给其他政党的，——那末，如果要想前进，我们自己就应当揭露和纠正自己的错误，这难道还不明白吗？再没有人来揭露和纠正自己的错误，这难道还不明白吗？自我批评应当是推动我们向前发展的重大力量之一，同志们，这难道不明白吗？
    自我批评口号在我党第十五次代表大会以后获得了特别强有力的发展。为什么呢？因为从第十五次代表大会消灭了反对派以后，在党内便造成了一种我们不能不加以重视的新的情况。
    情况的崭新之处是什么呢？就是我们再也没有或几乎再也没有反对派了，就是由于容易地取得了对反对派的胜利，而这（即胜利）本身对于党是极重大的好处，所以在党内便能造成高枕而卧、安然自在、闭眼不看我们工作缺点的危险。
    容易地取得对反对派的胜利，这对于我们党是极大的好处。但它自身包藏着特别的缺点，就是党能被自满的情绪、被自以为是和高枕而卧的情绪所渗透着。而高枕而卧是意味着什么呢？这是意味着：葬送我们的前进运动。而为了不使这种事情发生，我们便需要自我批评，但不是反对派所进行的那种恶意的、实质上是反革命的自我批评，而是诚实的、公开的、布尔什维克的自我批评。
    我党第十五次代表大会估计到了这个情形，提出了自我批评口号。从此自我批评的浪潮便日益高涨起来，在中央委员会和中央监察委员会四月全会的工作上也刻上自己的标记。
    怕我们的敌人、国内敌人和国外敌人利用我们的缺点，大声叫喊：呵，他们布尔什维克那里并不是百事顺遂，——那就奇怪了。我们布尔什维克要怕这一切——那就奇怪了。布尔什维主义的力量也正在于：他们不怕承认自己的错误。让党、让布尔什维克、让我国一切诚实的工人和劳动分子来揭露我们工作中的缺点、我们建设中的缺点吧，让他们指出消灭我们缺点的途径，以便我们工作中和我们建设中不再有停滞、糟糕、腐败的现象，以便我们的全部工作、我们的全部建设一天天地改善并且从成功走到成功吧。现在主要的就是这个。此外就让敌人去胡聊我们的缺点吧——这样的小事情是不能而且不应当使我们布尔什维克窘困的。
    最后，还有一种情形，促使我们要进行自我批评。我指的是群众与领袖的问题。最近在我们这里开始造成了领袖和群众间的某些特殊关系。一方面，在我们这里划分出了、从历史上形成了一个领导者集团，这些领导者的威信愈来愈高地上升着，而且这个集团高得几乎是群众所达不到的了。另一方面，工人阶级群众，首先是一般劳动群众，提高得非常地慢，他们开始眯着眼睛从下向上看自己的领袖，而且往往怕批评自己的领袖。
    当然，我们这里形成了一个上升得很高和有很大威信的领导者集团，——这个事实本身就是我们党很大的成绩。显然地，没有这样一个有威信的领导者集团存在，要领导很大的一个国家是不可想像的。但是，领袖们在上升时候便离开群众，而群众则开始从下向上地看着自己的领袖而不敢批评他们，——这个事实便不能不造成领袖脱离群众和群众离开领袖的某种危险。
    这个危险能造成这样的一种结果，即领袖骄傲起来，自以为一切都对。上层领导者骄傲起来，开始瞧不起群众，这能有什么好处呢？显然地，除了使党灭亡而外，是不会有别的结果的。可是我们却愿意前进和改善自己的工作，而不是要使党灭亡。正是为了前进并改善领袖和群众间的关系，就必须时时刻刻开放自我批评的门户，必须给苏维埃人们以可能性来“咒骂”自己的领袖，犯了错误就批评他们，使得领袖不骄傲而群众不离开领袖。
    有时候人们把群众和领袖问题与提拔干部问题混为一谈。同志们，这是错误的。这里所说的不是提拔新的领袖，虽然这件事情是值得党严重注意的。这里所说的是保存已经提拔起来的和有威信的领袖，建立他们与群众之间经常的和牢而不破的联系。这里所说的是凭着对我们缺点的批评和自我批评，去组织党的广泛舆论、工人阶级的广泛舆论，来作为生动的和警醒的精神上的监督，而极有威信的领袖，如果他们要保持党的信任、工人阶级的信任，就应当细心地倾听这些意见。
    在这个意思下，我们党——苏维埃的报刊的意义的确是不可估计的。在这个意思下，不能不欢迎《真理》报之首倡组织“工农检查栏”来进行对我们工作缺点的有系统的批评。不过还必须努力使批评严肃而且深刻，不要浮光掠影。在这个意思下，也应该欢迎《共青真理》报之首倡热烈和勇敢地攻击我们工作的缺点。
    有时候人们责骂批评者，说他们的批评并不是十全十美的，说批评有时候不是百分之百地正确。往往人们要求批评每一点都应该是正确的，而如果批评不是每一点都正确的，他们便开始叱责、谩骂起来。
    同志们，这是不正确的。这是危险的错误。只要把这个要求试提出来，你们就会塞住成千成万愿意纠正我们的缺点但有时候还不善于正确地表达自己意思的工人、工人通讯员、农村通讯员的口。这便是死路，而不是自我批评。
    你们应当知道：工人们有时候对于我们工作的缺点有点怕说实话。他们有点怕，不只是因为他们因此会“挨揍”，而且是因为他们怕人们“笑”他们批评得不完全。在自己身上体验到我们工作和我们计划的缺点的普通工人和普通农民，怎么能井井有条地论证自己的批评呢？如果你们要求他们的批评百分之百正确，那末你们就会消灭任何来自下面的批评的可能性、任何自我批评的可能性。所以我认为：即令批评只包括着百分之五到百分之十的真理，那末就是这种批评也应该欢迎，细心地倾听，抓住其中健全的核心。我重说一遍：要不然的话，你们就得把成千成万忠心于苏维埃事业的人们的口塞住，因为他们在自己的批评工作中还没有足够的经验，但是真理本身是从他们的口中说出来的。
    正是为了不压制自我批评而把它展开起来，正是为了这个，就必须细心地听完苏维埃人们的任何批评，即令这个批评有时候并非完完全全都是正确的。只有在这些条件下，才能使群众确信：他们不会因为不完善的批评而“挨揍”，也不会因为他们批评有某些错误而被“嘲笑”。只有在这个条件下，自我批评才能具有真正的群众性质和真正的群众面貌。
    不言而喻，这里所讲的并非“任何种类的”批评。反革命者的批评也是批评。但这种批评的目的是毁谤苏维埃政权，破坏我们的工业，瓦解我们党的工作。显然地，这里所讲的不是这种批评。我们所讲的不是这种批评，而是来自苏维埃人们的批评，是其目的在于改善苏维埃政权机关、改善我们工业、改善我们党和职工会工作的批评。我们须要批评是为了巩固苏维埃政权，而不是为了削弱它。正是为了巩固和改善我们的事业，正是为了这个，党才颁布了批评和自我批评口号。
    如果自我批评执行得正确和诚实，那末我们对自我批评口号首先期望些什么呢，这个口号能给我们什么结果呢？这个口号应当至少给我们以两个结果。第一，它应当提高工人阶级的警惕性，把工人阶级对我们缺点的注意力尖锐化起来，促进这些缺点的改正，并且使我们工作中任何的“意外”成为不可能。第二，它应当提高工人阶级的政治修养，发挥他们的国家主人翁感觉，并且促进工人阶级管理国家的训练。
    你们是否注意到：不仅沙赫亭事件，而且一九二八年一月的粮食采办工作危机，对于我们很多同志都是“意外”？在这一方面特别值得注意的是沙赫亭事件。一批反革命的资产阶级专家工作了五年，从国际资本的反苏组织接受指令。五年来我们的组织写出了和发出了各种各样的决议和指令。当然，我们石炭工业的事业到底还在上升着，因为苏维埃经济体系是如此生气勃勃和强大有力，以致于不管我们的没脑子和我们的错误，不管专家们的破坏工作，我们的石炭工业毕竟还是胜利了。五年来这批反革命专家在我们的工业里进行了危害工作，炸毁炉锅，破坏透平等等。我们却坐着，安然无事。结果“突然”，像冷水浇头一样——发生了沙赫亭事件。
    同志们，这是正常的吗？我想这是非常不正常的。掌着船舵，睁眼看着，但什么也看不见，一直到情况把我们的鼻子拉去碰上什么灾难——这并不等于领导。布尔什维主义不是这样理解领导的。要领导就必须预见。而预见总不是容易的事情，同志们。
    一二十个领导同志注视和发现我们工作中的缺点，而工人群众则不愿意或不能够注视和发现缺点，——这是一回事。这里有一切把握可以断定一定会看漏一些缺点，发现不出所有的缺点。几十万和几百万工人同一二十个领导同志一起注视和发现我们工作中的缺点，揭露我们的错误，参加总的建设事业并指出改善事情的途径，——这是另一回事。这里更有把握可以断定不会有意外发生，不良的现象将及时发现，并且将及时采取办法来消灭这些现象。
    我们必须这样地处理事情，以便工人阶级的警惕性能获得发展而不致被压制，以便千百万工人都来参加社会主义建设的共同事业，以便千百万工人和农民，而不只是一二十个领导者，刮目注视我们建设的进程，指出我们的错误并把它们拉到日光下来。只有在这个条件下，在我们这里才不会有“意外”发生。但是为了能做到这点，我们就必须展开来自下面的对我们缺点的批评，我们就必须造成群众性的批评，我们就必须接受和实现自我批评口号。
    最后，与实行自我批评口号相联系，关于提高工人阶级文化力量问题，关于培植工人阶级管理国家的技能问题，列宁曾经说过：
    “我们所缺乏的主要东西——是文化，是管理的本领。……新经济政策在经济方面和政治方面完全给我们保证了建立社会主义经济基础的可能。问题“只是”在于无产阶级及其先锋队的文化力量。”
    这是什么意思呢？这就是说，我们建设的主要任务之一是培植工人阶级管理国家、管理经济、管理工业的技能和本领。
    如果我们不发挥工人的力量和能力，不发挥工人阶级优秀分子的力量和能力来批评我们的错误，指出我们的缺点并推动我们的工作，那末我们能不能在工人阶级中间培养这些技能和这种本领呢？显然是不可能的。
    那末需要什么，才能发挥工人阶级和一般劳动者的力量和能力，并使他们能获得管理国家的技能呢？
    为了这个，首先就须要诚实地和布尔什维克式地实行自我批评的口号，诚实地和布尔什维克式地实行从下面对我们工作缺点和错误的批评的口号。如果工人利用公开和直接地批评工作缺点、改善我们工作和推动我们工作的可能，这是意味着什么呢？这是意味着：工人们变为国家、经济、工业领导事业的积极参加者。而这就不能不提高工人的国家主人翁感觉，提高他们的积极性、他们的警惕性、他们的文化。
    工人阶级文化力量问题是有决定意义的问题之一。为什么呢？因为在至今存在的一切统治阶级中，工人阶级这一统治阶级是占有一种稍为特别的和不很有利的地位。至今曾占过统治地位的一切阶级——奴隶主、地主、资本家——同时又是富有的阶级。他们有教自己子弟以管理方面所必需的知识和技能的可能。工人阶级与这些阶级的区别就中是在于：它是贫穷的阶级，它从前没有教自己子弟以管理方面的知识和技能的可能，而且它只在现在，在取得政权后，才获得了这种可能。
    我们文化革命问题之如此迫切，就中便在于这一点。诚然，苏联工人阶级在其十年统治中在这方面的成就，比地主和资本家一百年的要大得多。但国际和国内的形势是这样：我们所作到的成绩还远远不够。因此，凡是能提高工人阶级文化力量发展水平的手段，凡是能便利于培养工人阶级管理国家和工业的技能和本领的手段——凡是这样的手段，我们都应当尽量地利用。
    但是从上述的一切可以得出结论说：自我批评口号是发展无产阶级文化力量、培养工人阶级管理技能的最主要手段之一。由此又得出一个理由，说明实现自我批评口号是我们生命攸关的任务。
    一般讲来，责成我们把自我批评口号当作迫切口号的理由就是如此。
    因此，中央委员会和中央监察委员会四月全会的工作是在自我批评的标志下进行的，这就毫不足怪了。
                              （曹葆华、毛岸青译）
