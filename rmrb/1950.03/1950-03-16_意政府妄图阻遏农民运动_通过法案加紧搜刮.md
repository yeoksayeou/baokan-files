Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 14th: As the broad masses of farmers' land occupation movement rapidly develops, the Italian Council of Ministers was forced to pass two bills, attempting to halt the continued expansion of the movement by "partially satisfying" the farmers' demands.

According to TASS, Rome, March 12th, the Italian Council of Ministers has approved a bill regarding an annual allocation and expenditure procedure of 120 billion lire, to be used for "developing" the economies of backward regions in Southern Italy, including land reclamation, irrigation projects, and road construction. The Gasperi government decided to increase taxes to make up for a large portion of this allocation; therefore, the prices of certain consumer goods, such as fuel, tobacco products, sugar, and coffee, have already increased accordingly.

Unità commented: "This is a severe blow to the working people's living budget. The government wants to extract almost half of the so-called 'investment fund' from the people, which is unprecedented."

At the same time, due to the pressure from the farmers' movement to seize land, the Council of Ministers decided to submit an emergency bill to the parliament before the fully promised "land reform" is implemented. It proposes to transfer approximately 500,000 hectares of land belonging to landowners in the Fucino area of Sardinia, the Lucania region, and certain other areas, in advance, for distribution to the farmers.

　　意政府妄图阻遏农民运动
    通过法案加紧搜刮
    【新华社十四日讯】在广大农民的占地运动迅速开展下，意大利部长会议被迫通过两个法案，企图以“部分满足”农民要求的方法来阻止运动的继续扩大。
    据塔斯社罗马十二日讯，意部长会议已批准关于每年一千二百亿拨款及开支程序的法案，将该款作为“发展”南意落后地区的经济，包括开垦荒地，灌溉工程和修筑道路等等。加斯贝利政府决定增加税收来弥补此项拨款的大部分，因此，若干消费品如燃料、烟草制品、糖、咖啡的价格已随着增加。
    团结报评称：“这是对于劳动人民生活预算的严重打击。政府要想自人民身上搜刮出几乎一半的所谓‘投资基金’，这是史无前例的事情。”
    同时，由于农民争取土地运动的压力，部长会议决定了在预先应允的全盘“土地改革”尚未实施之前，向议会提出紧急法案，建议把萨丁岛上福齐诺地方的路坎尼亚区及若干其他地区属于地主的约五十万公顷土地，先行让渡，以分配给农民。
