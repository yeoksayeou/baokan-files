Against Vulgarizing the Slogan of Self-Criticism
    Stalin
    Originally published in Pravda on June 26, 1928, and now included in Volume 11 of the Complete Works of Stalin, published in 1949. There was no Chinese translation in the past. It is specially published for our reference when carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Editor
    The slogan of self-criticism cannot be regarded as something that is transient and fleeting. Self-criticism is a special method, a Bolshevik method of educating party cadres and the working class in the spirit of revolutionary development in general. Marx said long ago that self-criticism is a method of consolidating the proletarian revolution. As for self-criticism within our party, its beginning can be traced back to the emergence of Bolshevism in our country, that is, to the earliest days when Bolshevism was born as a special revolutionary faction in the workers' movement.
    As everyone knows, Lenin, as early as the spring of 1904, when Bolshevism was not yet an independent political party but was working with the Mensheviks within a single Social Democratic Labor Party, Lenin at that time already called on the party to conduct "self-criticism and ruthless exposure of its own shortcomings." Lenin wrote at that time in his pamphlet "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back":
    "They (i.e., the enemies of Marxism – Stalin's note) gloat over our disputes, rejoice; they naturally try to distort things for their own purposes, quoting individual chapters and verses from my pamphlet which deals with the shortcomings of our party. However, the Russian Social Democrats have long been battle-tested and weathered storms; they will not be disturbed by these petty pricks, but will continue their work of self-criticism, ruthlessly exposing their own shortcomings, which are bound to be overcome as the workers' movement grows. Let the enemy gentlemen try to show us a picture of the real situation within their 'party' – even slightly resembling the picture provided by the records of our Second Congress!" (Volume 6, page 161)
    Therefore, those comrades who believe that self-criticism is a transient phenomenon, a fad that, like any other fad, will soon pass, are completely wrong. In fact, self-criticism is an inseparable and constantly used weapon in the Bolshevik arsenal, a weapon inseparably linked to the nature of Bolshevism itself, to its revolutionary spirit.
    Sometimes people say: self-criticism is a good thing for a party that has not yet taken power, because it has "nothing to lose," but self-criticism is dangerous and harmful for a party that is already in power, because there are many hostile forces around it, and the enemy can use its exposed shortcomings against it.
    That is not right. That is completely wrong! On the contrary, it is precisely because the Bolsheviks are already in power, precisely because the Bolsheviks may become arrogant due to the achievements of our construction, precisely because the Bolsheviks may not see their own shortcomings, thus facilitating the enemy's actions – precisely because of this, self-criticism, especially now, especially after seizing power, is particularly necessary.
    Is it not clear that self-criticism, which aims to expose and eliminate our mistakes and shortcomings, can only facilitate the cause of Bolshevism's struggle against the enemies of the working class under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat? Lenin foresaw these characteristics of the situation after the Bolsheviks seized power, and in his pamphlet "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," written in April-May 1920, he wrote: "A party's attitude towards its own mistakes is one of the most important and reliable criteria for judging how earnest the party is and how it fulfills in practice its obligations towards its class and the toiling masses. To admit a mistake frankly, to disclose its reasons, to analyze the circumstances which gave rise to it, and to discuss meticulously the means of correcting it – that is the earmark of a serious party; that is how it should perform its duties, and how it should educate and train the class, and then the masses." (Volume 25, page 200)
    Lenin was a thousand times correct when he said at the Eleventh Party Congress in March 1922: "The proletariat is not afraid to admit that in the revolution it did this thing excellently and did not do that thing well. All revolutionary parties which have hitherto perished, perished because they grew arrogant, failed to see where they lacked strength, and feared to speak of their weaknesses. But we shall not perish, because, we do not fear to speak of our weaknesses and shall learn to overcome them."
    There is only one conclusion: without self-criticism, there is no correct education of the party, the class, and the masses – there is no Bolshevism.
    Why has the slogan of self-criticism gained particular importance precisely now, precisely at the current historical juncture, precisely in 1928?
    Because the sharpening of class relations, both domestically and abroad, has become more evident now than it was a year or two ago.
    Because the sabotage of the class enemies of the Soviet regime, who use our shortcomings and our mistakes to oppose our working class, has been revealed more clearly now than it was a year or two ago.
    Because the lessons of the Shakhty Affair and the "cunning plans" of rural capitalists to deal with grain procurement, coupled with the errors in our work plans, cannot and should not pass without leaving a trace for us.
    We must quickly get rid of the mistakes and shortcomings revealed by the Shakhty Affair and the difficulties in grain procurement if we want to consolidate the revolution and be prepared to deal with the enemy.
    We must quickly expose our shortcomings and errors that have not yet been exposed but undoubtedly exist, if we do not want to be caught off guard by all sorts of "accidents" and "incidents" and make the enemies of the working class happy.
    Delay here is tantamount to facilitating the enemy's actions, deepening our shortcomings and errors. But to achieve all this, it is impossible without launching self-criticism, without strengthening self-criticism, without involving millions of working class and peasant masses in discovering and eliminating our shortcomings and errors.
    Therefore, the April Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission was completely correct when it stated in the resolution on the Shakhty Affair:
    "The most important condition for ensuring the successful completion of all the planned measures should be the genuine implementation of the 15th Congress's slogan of self-criticism."
    But to launch self-criticism, it is first necessary to overcome many obstacles that stand before the party. Belonging to this category of obstacles are the cultural backwardness of the masses, the lack of cultural strength of the proletarian vanguard, our stubborn conservatism, our "Communist airs," and so on. However, one of our most serious obstacles – if not the most serious – is the bureaucratism in our organs. This refers to the bureaucrats in our party, state, trade union, cooperative, and other organs. This refers to those bureaucrats who live off our shortcomings and mistakes, who fear mass criticism and mass supervision like fire, who hinder us from launching self-criticism, who hinder us from getting rid of our shortcomings and our errors. Bureaucratism in our organs cannot be regarded as merely a matter of officialdom and red tape. Bureaucratism is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's influence on our organizations. Lenin was right when he said:
    "We must realize that the struggle against bureaucracy is an absolutely indispensable struggle, and that it is as intricate as the task of combating petty-bourgeois spontaneity. Bureaucratism has become such a canker in our state organism that it is mentioned in the Party Program itself, and this is because it is connected with petty-bourgeois spontaneity and its dispersion." (Volume 26, page 220)
    If we really want to launch self-criticism and get rid of the canker in our construction cause, then we should wage a more tenacious struggle against bureaucratism in our organizations.
    We should more tenaciously arouse millions of workers and peasant masses to carry out criticism from below, to implement supervision from below, as the main antidote to bureaucratism.
    Lenin was right when he said:
    "If we want to combat bureaucracy, we must enlist the participation of the lower ranks"... because "what other method is there of abolishing bureaucracy than by enlisting workers and peasants?" (Volume 25, pages 495, 496)
    But in order to "enlist" the participation of millions of masses, it is necessary to develop proletarian democracy in all mass organizations of the working class, and first and foremost within the party itself. Without this condition, self-criticism is equal to zero, an empty shell, empty words.
    We do not need just any kind of self-criticism. We need a kind of self-criticism that raises the cultural level of the working class, develops its fighting spirit, consolidates its confidence in victory, increases its strength, and helps it become the true master of the state.
    Some people say: since there is self-criticism, there is no need for labor discipline, and it is possible to abandon work and just chat about anything. This is not self-criticism, but a mockery of the working class. Self-criticism is needed not to undermine labor discipline, but to consolidate labor discipline, to make labor discipline a conscious labor discipline, capable of resisting petty-bourgeois laxity.
    Others say: since there is self-criticism, there is no longer any need for leadership, and it is possible to leave the helm and let everything go on the "natural course of things." This is not self-criticism, but a disgrace. Self-criticism is needed not to relax leadership, but to strengthen leadership, to transform leadership on paper and without prestige into lively and truly prestigious leadership.
    But there is also another kind of "self-criticism," which is to undermine party spirit, discredit the Soviet regime, weaken our construction, corrupt economic cadres, disarm the proletariat, and cause idle talk about degeneration. The Trotskyist opposition called on us yesterday to engage in this kind of "self-criticism." Needless to say, the party has nothing in common with this "self-criticism." Needless to say, the party will oppose this "self-criticism" with all its strength and all its means.
    It is necessary to strictly distinguish that destructive, anti-Bolshevik "self-criticism" that is alien to us from our own, Bolshevik self-criticism, the purpose of which is to cultivate party spirit, consolidate the Soviet regime, improve our construction, strengthen our economic cadres, and arm the working class.
    The movement to strengthen self-criticism only began a few months ago. We do not yet have enough material to make a preliminary summary of this movement. However, it can already be said that this movement has begun to produce its own good results.
    It is undeniable that the tide of self-criticism is beginning to grow and expand, increasingly encompassing broad strata of the working class and involving them in the cause of socialist construction. Even such facts as the activity of production conferences and temporary supervision committees illustrate this point.
    Indeed, there are still people who attempt to shelve the well-founded and verified instructions of production conferences and temporary supervision committees, and the most resolute struggle must be waged against this attempt, because its purpose is to dispel the workers' interest in self-criticism. But there is hardly any reason to doubt that this kind of bureaucratic attempt will cause the rising tide of self-criticism to recede without a trace.
    It is also undeniable that, as a result of self-criticism, our economic cadres are beginning to catch up, are more vigilant, and are beginning to treat economic leadership issues more seriously, while our party, Soviet, trade union, and any other cadres are becoming more sensitive and better able to meet the demands of the masses.
    Indeed, it cannot be assumed that democracy within the party and general worker democracy has been fully realized in the mass organizations of the working class.
    But there is no reason to doubt that this cause will move forward as the movement continues to develop.
    It is also undeniable that, as a result of self-criticism, our newspapers have become more active and lively, and our newspaper staff, such as the worker correspondent organization, has begun to become a significant political force.
    Indeed, our newspapers often still skim the surface, and have not yet learned to move from individual comments to more in-depth criticism, and from in-depth criticism to generalizations, indicating what achievements our construction has gained as a result of criticism. But there is hardly any doubt that this cause will move forward in the further progress of the movement.
    However, it must be pointed out that, in addition to these advantages, our movement also has some shortcomings. This refers to the distortion of the slogan of self-criticism, which has occurred now, at the beginning of the movement, and if we do not refute it now, it will create the danger of vulgarizing self-criticism.
    (1) First of all, it must be pointed out that some newspaper organizations are beginning to show a tendency to shift the movement from a factual criticism of the shortcomings of our socialist construction to an advertising-style shouting against various extreme phenomena in personal life. This may be difficult to believe. However, unfortunately, it is a fact.
    Take the "Labor Regime" newspaper, the organ of the Irkutsk District Committee and District Executive Committee (Issue 128), as an example. There, you will see that an entire page is scattered with various advertising-style "slogans": "Sexual promiscuity is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie," "Drinking a glass will make you drink another," "Love your own thatched cottage, love your own cow," "Robbers of bedding for two," "Guns that don't fire," and so on. I ask, what does this "critical" shouting, worthy of the "Stock Exchange" magazine, have in common with Bolshevik self-criticism aimed at improving our socialist construction? It is very possible that the author of these advertising-style articles is a Communist. It is possible that he fiercely hates the "class enemies" of the Soviet regime. But here he has gone astray, vulgarized the slogan of self-criticism, and is speaking in a voice that is not of our class – it is impossible to doubt this.
    (2) Secondly, it must be pointed out that even those newspaper organizations that can generally carry out correct criticism – even they sometimes go astray in criticizing for the sake of criticism, turning criticism into a game, causing agitation. Take the "Communist Youth League Truth" newspaper as an example. Everyone knows the merits of the "Communist Youth League Truth" newspaper in launching self-criticism. But take the recent issues of this newspaper and look at the "criticism" of the leaders of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, a whole series of impermissible satires on this topic. I ask, who needs this kind of "criticism"? What else can it give us besides damaging the reputation of the slogan of self-criticism? Why is this "criticism" needed, if attention is paid to the interests of our socialist construction, and not to cheap agitation aimed at winning the laughter of the philistines? Of course, self-criticism needs all kinds of weapons, including "light cavalry." But does this mean that the light cavalry should become reckless cavalry?
    (3) Finally, it must be pointed out that many of our organizations have a definite tendency to turn self-criticism into a means of slandering our economic workers, a means of discrediting them in the eyes of the working class. In fact, some local organizations in Ukraine and Central Russia have launched direct slander against our excellent economic workers, and their only crime is that they cannot guarantee 100% freedom from error. If this is not the case, then how can we understand the decisions of local organizations to dismiss these economic workers, which have no binding force, but are clearly aimed at discrediting them? If this is not the case, then how can we understand that criticism is criticism, but economic workers are not allowed to answer the criticism? Since when have we started to pass off the "Shemyakin trial" (unfair trial – translator's note) as self-criticism?
    Of course, we cannot demand that criticism be 100% correct. If criticism comes from below, then even if this criticism is only 5-10% correct, we should not despise it. But can it be concluded that we should demand that economic workers guarantee 100% freedom from error? Is there anyone in the world who can guarantee 100% freedom from error? Is it so difficult to understand that cultivating economic cadres takes years and years, and that the attitude towards economic workers should be the most cherished and caring attitude? Is it so difficult to understand that we need self-criticism not to slander economic cadres, but to improve and strengthen them?
    Please criticize the shortcomings in our construction, but do not vulgarize the slogan of self-criticism, do not turn it into a tool for advertising exercises to write these topics: "Robbers of bedding for two," "Guns that don't fire," and so on.
    Please criticize the shortcomings in our construction, but do not damage the reputation of the slogan of self-criticism, do not turn it into a kitchen for creating cheap agitation.
    Please criticize the shortcomings in our construction, but do not distort the slogan of self-criticism, do not turn it into a tool for slandering our economic workers and any other workers.
    Most importantly: do not replace mass criticism from below with "critical" empty talk from above, let the working class masses be involved in this cause, let them show creative initiative in correcting our mistakes and improving our construction cause. Pravda, page 146, June 26, 1928.

### 反对把自我批评口号庸俗化

专栏：

　　反对把自我批评口号庸俗化
    斯大林
    原文第一次发表于一九二八年六月二十六日真理报，现刊载于一九四九年出版的斯大林全集第十一卷。过去是没有过中译文的。特刊出以供我们开展批评与自我批评时的参考。    编者
    不能把自我批评口号看作一种转瞬过去的和倏忽即逝的东西。自我批评是一种特殊的方法，是以革命发展的精神一般来教育党的干部和工人阶级的布尔什维克方法。马克思早就说过：自我批评是巩固无产阶级革命的方法。至于说到我们党内的自我批评，那末自我批评的开端是在我国布尔什维主义出现开始时起的，即在布尔什维主义作为工人运动中一种特别的革命派别而诞生出来的最初几天起的。
    大家知道，列宁还在一九○四年春天，当布尔什维主义还不是一个独立的政党，而是与孟什维克一起在一个社会民主工党内工作时，——大家知道，列宁在那时候就已经号召党进行“自我批评和无情地揭露自己的缺点”。列宁那时候在自己的小册子“进一步，退两步”里曾经这样写道：
    “他们（即马克思主义者的敌人——斯大林注）看见我们的争论，就幸灾乐祸起来，洋洋得意；他们为着自己的目的，自然竭力想断章取义，摘引我这本专论我们党的种种缺点的小册子中的个别章句。可是，俄国社会民主党人已经久历战斗，饱受风霜，决不会被这区区针刺所惊扰，却能够不管这些针刺，而依然继续其自我批评的工作，无情地揭露自己的缺点，这些缺点是一定和必然会因工人运动增长而被克服的。让敌人老爷们试拿出他们“党”内的真实情况的图画——那怕就是稍微近似于我们第二次代表大会记录所提供的图画——来给我们看看吧！”（第六卷，第一六一页）
    因此，一些同志认为自我批评是转瞬过去的现象，是一种时髦品，它与普通任何时髦品一样一定很快就会过时的，——这些同志是完全错误了。其实自我批评是布尔什维主义武库中不可分割的和经常运用的武器，这个武器与布尔什维主义的性质本身、与它的革命精神是不可分离地联系着的。
    有时候人们说：自我批评对于还没有执政的党是好东西，因为它“无物可失”，然而自我批评对于已经在执政的党却是危险和有害的，因为在其周围有许多敌对的势力存在着，而敌人是可以利用它的被揭露出来的缺点来反对它的。
    这是不对的。这是完全不对的！相反地，正因为布尔什维克已经在执政，正因为布尔什维克由于我们建设的成绩会傲慢起来，正因为布尔什维克会看不到自己的缺点，因而会便利于敌人的勾当——正因为这样，所以自我批评，特别在现在，特别在取得了政权以后，是尤其需要的。
    自我批评是以揭露和消灭我们的错误、我们的缺点为目的，——自我批评在无产阶级专政条件下只能便利于布尔什维主义反对工人阶级敌人的斗争事业，这难道还不明白吗？列宁曾经估计到布尔什维克取得政权后这些情况的特点，他在一九二○年四月——五月自己所著的“共产主义运动中的‘左倾’幼稚病”小册子里写道：“一个党对于本身错误所持的态度，就是测验这个党的严肃性及其对本阶级和劳动群众所负义务的真正执行程度的最重要最可靠的尺度之一。公开承认错误，揭露错误的原因，分析产生错误的环境，仔细讨论改正错误的方法——这才是严肃的党的标志，这才是党对自己义务的执行，这才是对阶级、以至于对群众的教育和训练。”（第二十五卷，第二○○页）
    列宁是千倍地正确的，当他一九二二年三月在第十一次党代表大会上说：“无产阶级不怕承认它在革命中把什么什么做得很好，而把什么什么没有做到。一切至今灭亡了的革命党之所以灭亡，就是由于傲慢而看不见自己的力量在什么地方，害怕说出自己的缺点。而我们是不会灭亡的，因为我们不怕说出自己的缺点，能学会克服这些缺点。”
    结论只有一个：没有自我批评，就没有对党、对阶级、对群众的正确教育——就没有布尔什维主义。
    自我批评口号，为什么正好在现在，正好在当前的历史关头，正好在一九二八年获得了特别紧要的意义呢？
    因为现在比一两年前更鲜明地显露出了无论在国内方面或国外方面的阶级关系的尖锐化。
    因为现在比一两年前更鲜明地揭露出了苏维埃政权的阶级敌人之破坏工作，他们利用我们的缺点、我们的错误来反对我国工人阶级。
    因为沙赫亭事件的教训和农村资本主义分子“对付采办粮食的巧计”再加上我们工作计划的错误，对于我们是不能而且也不应当无影无踪地一下过去的。
    必须赶快摆脱沙赫亭事件和采办粮食工作困难所揭露出来的我们的错误和缺点，如果我们要巩固革命和有准备地对付敌人的话。
    必须赶快揭露我们那些还未被揭露出来的但毫无疑问是存在着的缺点和错误，如果我们不愿意被各种各样的“意外”和“偶然”事件弄得手足无所措而使工人阶级的敌人高兴的话。
    迟缓在这里就等于便利我们敌人的勾当，加深我们的缺点和错误。但是要作到这一切，不展开自我批评，不加强自我批评，不把千百万的工人阶级群众和农民群众卷入来发现与消灭我们的缺点和错误，是不可能的。
    因此，中央委员会和中央监察委员会四月全会是完全正确的，当它在关于沙赫亭事件的决议中说道：
    “保证顺利完成所拟定的一切措施之最主要条件，应当是真正实现第十五次代表大会的关于自我批评的口号。”
    但是要展开自我批评，就首先必须克服许多摆在党面前的阻碍。属于这一类阻碍的便是群众文化的落后，无产阶级先锋队文化力量的缺乏，我们的顽固保守，我们的“摆共产党员架子”等等。然而我们最严重的阻碍之一——即使不是最严重的阻碍——乃是我们机关中的官僚主义。这里所讲的是在我们党的、国家的、职工会的、合作社的以及其他的机关里的官僚主义分子。这里所讲的是这样的一些官僚主义分子，他们靠我们的缺点和错误过活，害怕群众批评和群众监督就像害怕火一样，妨碍我们展开自我批评，妨碍我们摆脱自己的缺点和自己的错误。不能把我们机关里的官僚主义看作只是一种官场习气和文牍主义。官僚主义是资产阶级对我们组织的影响的表现。列宁说得很对：
    “必须使我们懂得：与官僚主义作斗争是绝对必要的斗争，它就像与小资产阶级自发性作斗争的任务一样复杂。官僚主义在我们国家机构里已成了有这样一种意义的脓疮，以致于我们的党纲也说到它了，而这正是因为它与小资产阶级自发性及其蔓延相联系的。”（第二十六卷，第二二○页）
    如果我们真想展开自我批评和摆脱我们建设事业底脓疮，那就应当更加顽强地进行斗争来反对我们组织里的官僚主义。
    我们应当更加顽强地唤起千百万工人和农民群众来进行从下而上的批评，来实行从下而上的监督，以作为对付官僚主义的主要药剂。
    列宁说得很对：
    “如果我们想与官僚主义作斗争，我们就应当吸引下层群众来参加”……因为“不吸引工人和农民来参加，还有其他什么办法可以废止官僚主义呢？”（第二十五卷，第四九五、四九六页）
    但是为了“吸引”千百万群众来参加，就必须在工人阶级一切群众组织里，而首先在党本身内部展开无产阶级的民主。没有这个条件，自我批评便等于零，一个空架子，一句空话而已。
    我们所需要的并不是任何一种自我批评。我们所需要的是这样的一种自我批评，这种自我批评提高工人阶级的文化程度，发挥它的战斗精神，巩固它的胜利信心，增加它的力量，帮助它成为真正的国家主人。
    有些人说：既然有了自我批评，就无须劳动纪律了，就可以丢开工作而把什么都胡聊一阵了。这不是自我批评，而是对工人阶级的嘲笑。需要自我批评，并不是为了破坏劳动纪律，而是为了巩固劳动纪律，为了使劳动纪律成为自觉的劳动纪律，能抵拒小资产阶级的散漫性。
    另一些人则说：既然有了自我批评，那就不再需要领导了，就可以离开舵而让一切去走“事物的自然轨道”了。这不是自我批评，而是可耻。需要自我批评，并不是为了放松领导，而是为了加强领导，为了把纸上的和没有威信的领导变成生动的和真正有威信的领导。
    但是也有另外一种“自我批评”，它是破坏党性，使苏维埃政权丧失威信，削弱我们的建设，腐化经济工作干部，解除无产阶级武装，引起关于蜕化的胡聊。托洛茨基反对派昨天正是叫我们从事这种“自我批评”。不用说，党与这种“自我批评”是根本没有共同之处的。不用说，党是要用一切力量、一切办法来反对这种“自我批评”的。
    应当严格地把那与我们绝缘的、破坏性的、反布尔什维克的“自我批评”与我们的、布尔什维克的自我批评区别开来，我们的自我批评的目的是培植党性，巩固苏维埃政权，改善我们的建设，增强我们的经济干部，武装工人阶级。
    加强自我批评的运动仅仅在几个月前才开始。我们还没有材料足以给这一运动作出初步的总结。然而现在已经可以说这一运动开始产生自己良好的结果了。
    不可否认：自我批评的浪潮正开始成长和扩大，日益囊括工人阶级广大阶层并把它们卷入社会主义建设事业。即令是这样的一些事实，如生产会议和临时监督委员会的活跃，也说明了这一点。
    的确，还有人企图把生产会议和临时监督委员会的有根据的和审查过的指示束之高阁，必须作最坚决的斗争去反对这种企图，因为它的目的是打掉工人对自我批评的兴趣。可是几乎没有根据可以怀疑：这一类官僚主义的企图将使高涨着的自我批评浪潮无影无踪地退落下去。
    也不可否认：由于自我批评的结果，我们的经济工作干部开始赶上来了，较为警惕了，开始较为严肃地对待经济领导问题了，而我们党的、苏维埃的、职工会的以及任何其他的干部则开始较为锐敏了，较能满足群众要求了。
    的确，不可认为：党内的民主和一般工人的民主已经在工人阶级群众组织里完全实现了。
    但是没有根据可以怀疑：随着运动的继续展开，这个事业是会向前推进的。
    也不可否认：由于自我批评的结果，我们的报刊成为了更加活跃和生动的报刊，而我们的报纸工作人员队伍，类如工人通讯组织，已经开始变成重大的政治力量了。
    的确，我们的报刊往往还是浮光掠影，它还没有学会从个别的评述进到比较深刻的批评，而从深刻的批评进行概括批评的结果，表明由于批评的结果我们建设方面获得了什么样的成绩。但是几乎不能怀疑：这个事业在运动进一步的进程中是会向前推进的。
    然而必须指出：除了这些优点以外，我们的运动还有一些缺点。这是指对于自我批评口号的歪曲，这些歪曲在现在、在运动的开端便发生了，如果我们现在不给以反驳，就会造成把自我批评庸俗化的危险。
    （一）首先必须指出：一些报刊组织开始表现出这种趋向：把运动从对我国社会主义建设的缺点的实事求是的批评方面转移到反对个人生活的各种极端现象的广告式的叫喊方面。这也许很难使人相信。然而可惜这却是事实。
    就以《劳动政权》报、伊尔库斯克区委和区执委的机关报（第一二八期）作例子吧。你们在那里会看到整整的一版都散布着各种广告式的“口号”：“性生活的放纵是资产阶级的表现”，“喝了一杯会使你再喝一杯”，“自己的茅屋爱自己的牛”，“两人睡觉床铺的强盗们”，“没有响的枪”，诸如此类等等。试问这些无愧于《证券交易人》杂志的“批评的”叫喊与布尔什维克的以改善我们社会主义建设为目的的自我批评有什么共同之点呢？十分可能，这些广告式的文章的作者是共产党员。可能，他剧烈地仇恨苏维埃政权的“阶级敌人”。但是在这里他走入了迷途，把自我批评口号庸俗化，以不是我们阶级的声音讲话，——这是不可能怀疑的。
    （二）其次必须指出：甚至于那些一般讲来能够进行正确批评的报刊组织——甚至于它们有时候也走上为批评而批评的迷途，把批评变成一种游戏，引起激动。就拿《共产主义青年团真理报》作例子吧。大家都知道“共产主义青年团真理报”在展开自我批评上的功绩。但是把这个报最近几期拿来，看一看对全苏联职工会中央会议领导人物的“批评”，一整系列的对这个题目的不可容许的讽刺。试问谁需要这种“批评”呢？除了毁坏自我批评口号的声誉以外，它还能给我们什么东西呢？为什么需要这种“批评”呢，如果是注意我们社会主义建设的利益，而不是注意在于博得市侩们一笑的贱价的激动？当然，自我批评需要有一切种类的武器，连“轻骑兵”也在内。但是难道由此可以作出结论说：轻骑兵应当成为轻率的骑兵吗？
    （三）最后必须指出：我们的好些组织有这种确定的倾向：把自我批评变为中伤我们经济工作人员的手段，变为使他们在工人阶级面前丧失威信的手段。事实上，乌克兰和中央俄罗斯的某些地方组织曾经掀起了对我们优秀经济工作人员的直接中伤，而他们的全部罪过就是在于他们不能保证百分之百地不犯错误。如果不是这样，那末怎样来了解地方组织关于把这些经济工作人员撤职的决议呢，这些决议并没有任何约束力，而分明是指望使他们丧失威信。如果不是这样，那末怎样来了解：批评是批评了，而又不让经济工作人员回答批评呢？从什么时候起我们这里开始把“谢牟亚克裁判”（不公平的裁判。——译者注）冒充自我批评呢？
    当然，我们不能要求批评百分之百地正确。如果批评是从下而上来的，那末即使这个批评只是百分之五——十正确，我们也不应当加以轻视。但是难道可以作出结论说：我们应当要求经济工作人员保证百分之百地不犯错误吗？难道世界上有保证百分之百不犯错误的人吗？难道很难了解：培养经济工作干部需要几年又几年，对经济工作人员的态度在我们这里应该是最爱惜和关心的态度？难道很难了解：我们需要自我批评不是为了中伤经济工作干部，而是为了改善和加强他们？
    请批评我们建设中的缺点吧，可是不要把自我批评口号庸俗化，不要把它变成作广告练习用的工具来写这些题目：“两人睡觉床铺的强盗们”，“没有响的枪”等等。
    请批评我们建设中的缺点吧，可是不要毁坏自我批评口号的声誉，不要把它变成制造廉价激动的厨房。
    请批评我们建设中的缺点吧，可是不要歪曲自我批评口号，不要把它变成中伤我们经济工作人员及任何其他工作人员的工具。
    最主要的是：不要以从上而下的“批评的”空谈来代替从下而上的群众性的批评，让工人阶级群众卷入到这个事业中来，让他们在改正我们的错误方面、在改善我们建设事业方面表现出创造的主动性吧。真理报，第一四六页，一九二八年六月二十六日。
