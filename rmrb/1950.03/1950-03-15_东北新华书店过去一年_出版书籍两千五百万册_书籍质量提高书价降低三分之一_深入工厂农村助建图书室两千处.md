Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 13th: The publishing industry in Northeast China has developed rapidly. The Northeast General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, in coordination with economic construction work, published more than 25 million books last year. Among them, 35 were directly related to economic construction, 32 were theoretical books, and 362 were new and reprinted versions of other books. Textbooks, magazines, etc. for primary and secondary schools, workers, and peasants amounted to more than 19 million copies. The content and printing quality of the published books have improved compared to 1948. The price of books has also been reduced by one-third, alleviating a considerable burden on readers. In terms of distribution, in addition to supplying students, government cadres, and educated youths in various regions with books in a timely manner, it also provided a cultural diet for the vast number of workers and peasants. In urban distribution work, methods such as telephone book purchases and sending people to factories to help establish library reading rooms were adopted. In rural distribution work, efforts were also made to take the initiative to deliver winter school reading materials and a large number of popular reading materials, New Year pictures, and almanacs to rural areas. In conjunction with the winter school movement, more than 2,000 small rural libraries were established, and approximately one million copies of popular peasant readers were sold.
    The Northeast General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore recently held a branch meeting. According to the publishing plan of the Central People's Government's General Administration of Publications, the tasks for publishing work in Northeast China in 1950 were determined. In terms of publishing work, the first priority is to publish books about typical experiences in factory and enterprise management, introducing the advanced experiences of Soviet construction. The second is to closely coordinate with political tasks and the study of theoretical and professional knowledge by cadres. The third is to publish supplementary reading materials, popular reading materials, children's reading materials, and books to coincide with commemorative festivals related to culture and education. The planned publishing quantity will be more than one and a half times the publishing quantity in 1949, and the quality will also be improved and enhanced. In terms of distribution work, according to the publishing policy, the goal is to achieve planned, purposeful, and proactive distribution, maintain close contact with libraries, cultural centers, clubs, etc. in various regions, and pay attention to focused distribution work during certain periods and accelerate the turnover rate of distribution. In addition, attention should also be paid to helping and uniting private bookstores to jointly do a good job in the people's publishing industry.
