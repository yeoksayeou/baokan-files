　　Martyr Luo Shiwen's Posthumous Poem
    (Martyr Luo Shiwen was a member of the Chinese Communist Party and former Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the CCP. This poem was written by Comrade Luo Shiwen in the Baigongguan prison in Chongqing on October 18, 1946, when he was about to be executed.)
     The mountains and rivers of the motherland are magnificent,
     All hearts look forward to spring.
     Heroes boast of unity,
     Who will laugh at them later?
