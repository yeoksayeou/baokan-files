    Inside the Bombing
    Plans, planes, bombs—all American. Pilots and bombardiers—Americans. Nationalists—only nominal and following orders.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd] Because of the repeated failures of the American imperialist aggression schemes in China, American imperialism has decided to command the remaining Nationalist bandit gangs to expand the bombing of our major cities. The recent bombings of Nanjing, Hangzhou, Qingdao and other places, following Shanghai, are part of the joint bombing plan by American schemers and Nationalist remnants. It is reported that the bandit gang is building a new airport on Daishan Island in the Zhoushan Islands with American assistance. In addition, American aggressors are actively planning to use South Korea as an air base for the Nationalist air force in order to direct the Nationalist air force to bomb our major cities in Northeast China and North China. The bandit gangs, rewarded by the United States for "meritorious" bombing, have declared that they will bomb Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, Fuzhou and other places. In order to support the bandit bombing, the United States continues to transport aircraft to the bandit gang, twenty-five of which recently arrived in Taiwan. In fact, the inside story of the bombing is this: the plan—is American; the planes—are American; the bombs—are American; the pilots and bombardiers—part American, part Japanese, and Japan is under American control; the Nationalists only serve in name, the markings on the planes, and some personnel who follow orders. It is precisely because of this that American imperialists openly cheered the bandit gang's atrocities of bombing peaceful residents of Shanghai, even though the bombing deliberately damaged a small portion of American property. On February 11th, the United Press Washington dispatch lavishly praised the "effectiveness" of the bandit air force bombing, and said that "China's air force today seems to make the U.S. government feel apologetic for its contemptuous criticism of Chinese pilots." Recently, Kirk, the famous American aggressor and former commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, who arrived in Taiwan from the United States to carry out conspiracies, boasted in a speech to the bandit air force at the Chiayi Air Force Base in Taiwan on February 13 that the bandit air force's bestial behavior of bombing the people of Shanghai would "be recorded in history" and ordered them to "exert greater effectiveness." After Qingdao was bombed on February 27, the United States Information Service admitted in a message on the same day that the bombing was carried out by American-supplied aircraft, and threatened that Qingdao should be included in the "danger zone" because it "is within easy reach of American-made bombers from Taiwan." All of this allows people to see the bloody face of the American commander from the criminal bombings of the bandit gang.

    轰炸的内幕
    计划、飞机、炸弹——都是美国的驾驶员和轰炸员——美国和日本的国民党——只担任名义和听从命令                      
    【新华社北京二日电】因为在中国的侵略阴谋着着失败，美国帝国主义决定指挥残余国民党匪帮扩大对我各大城市的轰炸。最近南京、杭州、青岛等地继上海之后受到轰炸，即是美国阴谋家和国民党残匪合作轰炸计划的一部分。据息，匪帮正由美国帮助在舟山群岛中的岱山岛建立新的机场。此外，美国侵略者正在积极策划利用南朝鲜为国民党空军基地，以便指挥国民党空军轰炸我东北及华北各大城市。因轰炸“有功”而受美国奖励的匪帮已扬言将轰炸北京、天津、汉口、重庆、福州等地。为了支持匪帮轰炸，美国正继续将飞机运给匪帮，其中的二十五架已于最近运抵台湾。事实上轰炸的内幕是这样：计划——是美国的；飞机——是美国的；炸弹——是美国的；驾驶员和轰炸人员——一部分是美国的，一部分是日本的，而日本是在美国的控制之下；国民党只担任名义、飞机上的标志，以及一部分听命令行事的人员。正是因为如此，美国帝国主义者才公开对匪帮轰炸上海和平居民的暴行表示欢呼，虽然轰炸故意损害了一小部分美国人的财产。二月十一日，合众社华盛顿电曾大肆歌颂匪空军轰炸的“效力”，并说什么“中国的空军今天似乎要使美政府对中国飞行员所作的藐视性批评感觉得抱歉”。最近由美抵台湾进行阴谋活动的美国著名侵略分子、前美西太平洋舰队司令柯克，二月十三日在台湾嘉义空军基地对匪空军演讲时，竟忘形地吹嘘匪空军轰炸上海人民的兽行将“垂诸史册”，并命令他们“发挥更大效力”。二月二十七日青岛被炸后，美国新闻处当日消息中即承认这是美国所供给的飞机轰炸的，并威胁说从台湾至青岛“为美制轰炸机航程范围所易及者”，因此青岛应划入“危险区”。所有这些，都使人们从匪帮的罪恶轰炸中看到了美国指挥官的血腥面孔。
