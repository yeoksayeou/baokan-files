　　Procedures for Establishing a School in This City

Mr. Jing Xin:
　　The procedures for establishing a supplementary school or vocational school in this city are as follows: first, apply for registration with the Cultural and Educational Section of the district office in the area where you are located. After the district Cultural and Educational Section has investigated and understood the situation, they will forward it to the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education for processing. As for the qualifications that the applicant should possess, although there are no rigid regulations at present, generally speaking, they must have a considerable level of education or have undergone various professional training.

　　在本市成立学校的手续景新君：
    在本市成立补习学校或职业学校的手续，可先向所在地区公所文教科申请登记，经过区文教科的调查了解，再由他们转呈到市政府文教局处理。至于申请人应具备之条件，现在虽没有硬性规定，但一般来说必需具有相当的文化水平或经过各种专业训练。
