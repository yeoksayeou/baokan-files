　　Shanghai Private Factories Relocating Internally

　　Production and Sales Achieve Smooth Development; People's Government Provided Strong Assistance for Factory Relocation

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st] Under the call of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to smash the enemy's blockade, more than 20 private factories in Shanghai have, in the past six months, relocated all or part of their production to the inland, and have achieved smooth development in production and sales. Among the relocated factories, Meile Printing Factory, Kangle Tobacco Factory, Great Wall Pencil Factory (partial), and Universal Underwear Knitting Factory (partial), among seven others, relocated to Tianjin. Asia Electric Factory, Xin'an Electric Motor Factory, and Kailing Electric Motor Factory have established offices in Tianjin to carry out factory construction. Part of the Shanghai Pencil Factory relocated to Beijing to establish a branch factory. China Standard Pencil Factory established a branch factory in Harbin. Central Chemical Glass Factory relocated to Shenyang. Huafei Tobacco Factory, Longhua Tobacco Factory (partial), and others relocated to Zhengzhou. Xin Xin Hong Ji Match Factory and part of Zhengming Match Factory relocated to Kaifeng for joint operation. Part of Guoxin Textile Factory relocated to Xuzhou. Xinyi, Renhe, Shenghua, and Tianfeng four pharmaceutical factories relocated parts of their operations to Nantong to establish the Subei United Pharmaceutical Factory. Rongfeng Textile Factory relocated 4,000 spindles to Taizhou, Subei. The People's Government has provided great assistance for the relocation of these factories, such as providing them with information on raw materials and market conditions in various regions, and encouraging them to conduct on-the-spot investigations. In January of this year, the Ministry of Railways promulgated preferential measures for internally relocated factories, allocating vehicles to transport the machinery and equipment of internally relocated factories at half price. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government allocated special ships to transport equipment for Xinyi, Shenghua, and other four pharmaceutical factories. The Henan Provincial People's Government also formulated preferential measures for internally relocated factories in December of last year, providing appropriate adjustments and considerations in terms of land, buildings, loans, and property taxes. The factory sites and power issues of Longhua and Huafei Tobacco Factories, Zhengming and Xin Xin Hong Ji Match Factories, which relocated to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng last year, were all resolved by the Henan Provincial People's Government. The Longhua Tobacco Factory also received two loans from the People's Government, which solved the difficulty of construction costs for building houses. In addition, local public and private enterprises have also adopted various cooperative methods to help internally relocated factories solve funding and factory site problems. For example, the China Standard Pencil Factory has cooperated with the Harbin Enterprise Company, which is jointly operated by public and private sectors. The Central Chemical Glass Factory is jointly operated with the state-owned Shenyang Glass Factory. The Kangle Tobacco Factory is cooperating with the Tianjin private Xinxing Steel Refining Factory.

　　The factories that have relocated to the inland and have already started production are all experiencing smooth production and sales. For example, after the Shanghai Pencil Factory established a factory in Beijing, the cost was greatly reduced due to low raw material, fuel, and labor costs. Currently, the output has increased from 171 baskets of pencils per day at the end of last year to 250 baskets. The Xin'an Electric Motor Factory received a large number of orders from the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Tianjin Paper Company at the beginning of its factory construction. The Universal Underwear Knitting Factory has shipped 600 dozens in the past two months and sold them all. After the Kangle Tobacco Factory started production, the daily output increased from five boxes to nine boxes, and more than 2,000 boxes of products have been sold to various regions. After the Longhua Tobacco Factory started production, the daily output was about 20 boxes, and the number of workers in the factory has now increased to more than 120. The China Standard Pencil Factory has increased its monthly output from 5,000 baskets to 10,000 baskets. The Great Wall Pencil Factory also has a monthly output of 10,000 baskets, and sales are brisk. The Central Chemical Glass Factory and Huafei Tobacco Factory also have brisk sales.

　　In order to oppose bandit aircraft bombing and overcome the difficulties of power supply, the private Kailing Electric Motor Factory, which had originally decided to relocate to Tianjin to establish a branch factory, the Jishi Cigarette Factory, which is relocating to Zhengzhou, and the Quanchang Zhengji Match Stick Factory, which is relocating to Qinhuangdao, are now actively carrying out relocation work. In addition, the private Xinhe Yarn Factory and Dayunlong Tobacco Factory have also decided to relocate to Zhengzhou, and Jinghua Glass Factory has decided to relocate to Qingdao.

　　上海内迁私营工厂
    产销均获顺利发展  人民政府曾大力帮助迁厂
    【新华社上海一日电】在中共中央华东局粉碎敌人封锁的号召下，半年来上海已有二十余家私营工厂全部或部分迁至内地生产，并在产销方面获得顺利发展。内迁工厂中美乐印刷厂、康乐烟厂、长城铅笔厂（部分）、寰球内衣织造厂（部分）等七家迁至天津。亚洲电业厂、新安电机厂、开灵电机厂已在天津成立办事处进行建厂工作。上海铅笔厂部分迁至北京设立分厂。中国标准铅笔厂在哈尔滨建立了分厂。中央化工玻璃厂迁至沈阳。华菲烟厂、龙华烟厂（部分）等迁至郑州。新新宏记火柴厂和正明火柴厂一部分迁至开封合营。国信纺织厂部分迁至徐州。信谊、人和、生化、天丰四药厂部分迁至南通创办苏北联合药厂。荣丰纺织厂将四千纱锭迁至苏北泰州。人民政府对于这些工厂的迁移，曾给予很大的帮助。如供给他们以各地原料和市场的情况，鼓励他们进行实地考察。今年一月铁道部颁布了内迁工厂优待办法，拨出车辆以半价运输内迁工厂的机器设备。上海市人民政府曾拨专轮为信谊、生化等四药厂运送器材。河南省人民政府亦于去年十二月制定内迁工厂优待办法，在土地、建筑物，贷款、房地税等问题上，予以适当的调剂和照顾。去年迁往郑州、开封的龙华、华菲烟厂、正明、新新宏记火柴厂的厂址和动力问题，都是由河南省人民政府解决的。龙华烟厂，并得到人民政府的两次贷款，解决了建造房屋的开办费用的困难。此外，当地公、私营企业亦采取各种合作办法帮助内迁工厂解决资金和厂址问题。如中国标准铅笔厂即曾得到公私合营的哈尔滨企业公司的合作。中央化工玻璃厂与公营沈阳玻璃厂合营。康乐烟厂与天津私营新兴炼钢厂合作。
    迁往内地已经开工的各厂，产销均很顺利。如上海铅笔厂在北京设厂以后，因原料、燃料、人工低廉，成本大减，目前产量已自去年底每天产笔一百七十一箩增至二百五十箩。新安电机厂在建厂之初，就得到中央人民政府燃料工业部及天津造纸公司的大批定货。寰球内衣织造厂两个月来出货六百打全部售出。康乐烟厂开工后，由日产五箱增至九箱，产品推销各地已有两千余箱。龙华烟厂开工后，日产约二十箱，现该厂工人已增至一百二十余人。中国标准铅笔厂，已由月产五千箩增至一万箩。长城铅笔厂月产亦达一万箩，销路畅旺。中央化工玻璃厂、华菲烟厂销路亦均畅旺。
    为了反对匪机轰炸，克服电力供应的困难，原已决定迁天津设分厂的私营开灵电机厂，迁郑州的吉士卷烟厂，迁秦皇岛的全昌正记火柴梗片厂，现均积极进行迁移工作。此外私营信和纱厂、大运隆烟厂亦决定迁往郑州，晶华玻璃厂决定迁往青岛。
