Hebei Province's Last Year's Tax Revenue Work
    Provincial Total Exceeds Target, Many Regions Fail to Complete
    Some Cadres' "Light Tax" Ideology Urgently Needs to be Overcome
    [This newspaper dispatch] Reporter Lu Chaoqi reports: Hebei Province's total tax revenue for last year has exceeded the task stipulated by the Second North China Financial Conference by 3.2%. If it were not for the serious "light tax" ideology existing among some cadres, the achievements would have been even greater. As of the end of January, the task completion status (excluding liquor tax) for the four cities and ten special district tax bureaus in the province is as follows: Shijiazhuang exceeded the original assigned task by 26%, Tongxian Special District exceeded by 32.4%, Shijiazhuang Special District exceeded by 9.7%, Tianjin and Baoding Special Districts each exceeded by 7%, of which Baoding only completed 98.2%, Qinhuangdao only 96.4%, Tangshan only 91.7%, and other special districts only completed 75% to 96%.
    The reason why Hebei Province was able to exceed the target in general is due to four main reasons, in addition to the fact that most areas in the province were liberated earlier, the work foundation in various aspects was better, and most tax cadres worked hard: (1) Cities and most special commissioner's offices and counties often use meetings of representatives from all walks of life and meetings of industrial and commercial circles to explain tax policies, and report on tax issues at cadre meetings, so that the government's tax policies can be implemented among the masses. (2) The transaction tax is generally levied. Most of Hebei Province is a rural environment, and farmers sell agricultural products or purchase daily necessities at lower-level market transactions. Therefore, the source of transaction tax has generally become the largest tax source in various special districts. For example, the transaction tax revenue in Tongxian Special District accounts for 51% of the total task, Baoding Special District accounts for 48%, and Dingxian Special District, Shijiazhuang Special District, and Hengshui Special District all account for more than 42%. In terms of the entire province, transaction tax revenue accounts for 25% of total revenue, and together with industrial and commercial taxes, they are the province's two major tax sources. According to local experience, the main link in collecting transaction tax is to strengthen market management and the education of traders. Most of the province's more than 2,500 markets have established market management committees. If the organization of the committee is sound, it will play a great role in managing market transactions, maintaining order, mediating disputes, managing and educating traders, collecting transaction taxes on behalf, and inspecting tax evasion. For example, in Cangxian Special District, which governs two towns, nine counties, and 352 markets, after reorganizing the market management committee in November last year, transaction tax revenue increased by 28.3% compared with October.
    (3) In the collection of industrial and commercial taxes, cities, counties, and towns have implemented the mass line and adopted the method of combining typical investigations with democratic appraisal. These are the two main links in the collection of industrial and commercial taxes and cannot be neglected. During the appraisal, each industry generally appraises the burden score separately, and then repeatedly discusses it in a concentrated manner to ensure that the appraisal is reasonable. However, the leadership must grasp the typical household materials of each industry so that it can take the initiative in conducting leadership and avoid the phenomenon of "large squeezing small," "small squeezing large," or "squeezing the middle from both ends" during the appraisal. Local experience proves that every time industrial and commercial taxes are collected, industrialists and businessmen shout about the burden being too heavy in an attempt to evade the burden. However, as long as their actual affordability is thoroughly investigated, this attempt can be defeated without being attacked. For example, when Baoding City collected the third quarter's industrial and commercial taxes, many capitalists shouted that the burden was too heavy. However, after the provincial government, provincial party committee, provincial tax bureau, municipal tax bureau and other agencies organized an inspection team to conduct an investigation and proved that the actual burden was less than the burden they should bear, the shouting disappeared. When collecting the fourth quarter's industrial and commercial taxes, based on the third quarter's burden and adjusted according to the seasonal ups and downs, the collection was completed in just over ten days.

    Control the distribution centers of goods Strengthen anti-smuggling to prevent tax evasion
    (4) Most areas have initially paid attention to inspection and anti-smuggling and prevention of tax evasion. The main links in inspection and anti-smuggling are to control goods distribution centers such as railway stations, post offices, hostels, and warehouses, and to clean up the market with a focus. In their inspection work, all localities have discovered that merchants have serious tax evasion and tax evasion. For example, the income from various tax evasions and supplementary taxes investigated and dealt with by the Shijiazhuang City Tax Bureau throughout the year accounted for more than 7% of the city's total task completion.
    Generally speaking, the industrial and commercial taxes borne by industrialists and businessmen last year were not heavy. According to the statistical results of typical materials from four cities: the average annual burden of 13 households in 13 industries in Shijiazhuang City accounted for 22.2% of net profit, the average summer and autumn burdens of nine households in five industries in Qinhuangdao accounted for 24.4% of net profit, and the average summer and autumn burdens of 18 households in 18 industries in Tangshan accounted for 2.6% of net profit (all of the above are calculated in millet). The average burden of six households in five industries in Baoding from January to September accounted for 13.1% of net profit (the above is calculated in currency according to the regulations of the original North China People's Government).

　　河北省去年税收工作
    全省合计超过总额  不少地区并未完成
    部分干部轻税思想亟应克服
    【本报讯】记者陆超祺报道：河北省去年全省税收合计总额已超过原华北二届财政会议所规定的任务百分之三·二。如果不是因为部分干部中存在严重的轻税思想，成绩将会更大。该省四个市，十个专区税务局截至一月底止完成任务（酒税不在内）的情况是：石家庄超过原分配任务的百分之二六，通县专区超过百分之三二·四，石家庄专区超过百分之九·七，天津、保定专区各超过百分之七，其中保定只完成百分之九八·二，秦皇岛只百分之九六·四，唐山只百分之九一·七，其他专区都只完成了百分之七五至九六。
    河北省总的方面所以能够超额完成任务，除该省大部分地区解放较早，各方面工作基础较好以及大部税务干部努力外，主要有四个原因：（一）各市及大部分的专署、县常借各界代表会议、工商界会议解释税收政策，在干部会议上报告税收问题，因此，能使政府的税收政策贯彻到群众中去。（二）普遍开征交易税。河北省大部分是农村环境，农民出卖农产品或购买日用必需品，都在下层的集市交易。所以交易税的税源普遍成为各专区的最大税源，如通县专区的交易税收占总任务的百分之五一，保定专区占百分之四八，定县专区、石家庄专区、衡水专区等都占百分之四二以上。以全省来说，交易税收入占总收入的百分之二五，与工商业税同为该省两大主要税源。根据各地的经验，征收交易税的主要环节是加强集市管理和交易员的教育。该省二千五百余个集市中，大部分已成立集市管理委员会。如果委员会的组织健全，对于管理集市成交，维持秩序，调解纠纷，管理和教育交易员，代征交易税，检查偷税漏税等工作都起很大的作用。如沧县专区所辖的二个镇，九个县，三五二个集市，经去年十一月份整理集市管理委员会后，交易税收入比十月份增加百分之二八·三。
    （三）各市、县、镇在征收工商业税中，都贯彻了群众路线，采取典型调查结合民主评议的方法，这是征收工商业税的两个主要环节，不可偏废。评议时，一般先由各行业分别评议负担分数，然后再集中反复讨论，务使评议合理。但领导上必须掌握各行业的典型户材料，在评议时才能主动地进行领导和避免“大挤小”、“小挤大”或“两头挤中间”的现象。各地经验证明：每次征收工商业税时，工商业家都有叫喊负担过重企图逃避负担的情形。但只要深入调查其确实的负担能力，这种企图即可不攻自破。如保定市在征收第三季工商业税时，很多资本家都叫喊负担过重。但经省府、省委、省税务局、市税务局等机关组织检查团进行调查，证明其实际负担数还少于其应负担数以后，叫喊声也就没有了。在征收第四季工商业税时，以第三季负担为基础，按季节淡旺加以调整，在短短的十多天内就征收完毕。
    控制货物集散场所  加强缉私防止漏税
    （四）大部地区初步注意了稽查缉私、防止漏税工作。稽查缉私的主要环节是控制火车站、邮局、客栈、货栈等货物集散地和有重点地清理市场。各地在稽查工作中，都发现商人有严重的偷税、漏税行为。如石家庄市税局全年查缉各种漏税及补税的收入，占该市完成总任务的百分之七强。
    一般来说，工商业家去年负担的工商业税是不重的。根据四个市的典型材料的统计结果：石家庄市十三个行业的十三户全年负担平均占纯利的百分之二二·二，秦皇岛五个行业的九个户夏、秋两季负担平均占纯利百的分之二四·四，唐山十八个行业的十八个户夏、秋两季负担平均占纯利的百分之二·六（以上均以小米计算）。保定五个行业的六个户一至九月负担平均占纯利的百分之一三·一（以上按原华北人民政府的规定，以货币计算）。
