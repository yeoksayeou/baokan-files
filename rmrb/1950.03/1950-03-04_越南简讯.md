　　Vietnam Briefs

    The decree of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on reducing rent by 25 percent is being smoothly implemented in South Vietnam. Many landlords have implemented rent reductions in accordance with the rent reduction decree. Xuan Quang Province in Vietnam held a land distribution meeting in early February. The meeting resolved to distribute six properties formerly occupied by the French colonialists to local poor peasants. The meeting also discussed plans for developing production.
    Government departments in the Fourth War Zone of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are launching a wave of studying policies and revolutionary theory. The purpose of the study is to improve the political and theoretical foundation of civil servants in all departments, so that they can understand the urgent tasks under the new situation.
