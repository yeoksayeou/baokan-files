　　Strictly Check Bureaucracy
    Today, this newspaper published the situation before and after the major inspection of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. This fact clearly illustrates the harm of bureaucracy and shows that only through serious inspection can we expose and correct the errors of bureaucracy and improve our work.

    Bureaucracy is not just a form of "being idle all day long and doing nothing." This kind of bureaucracy is obvious. It is not easy for this kind of bureaucracy to openly survive and develop under the People's Government. What is prone to occur and breed in the revolutionary ranks is another kind of bureaucracy, that is, the kind of "hardworking bureaucracy" admitted by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in its self-criticism. This kind of bureaucracy is not unwilling to work, but works very hard; it is not idle, but busy; it does not simply pursue personal enjoyment, but is often hardworking. The masses with little political experience tend to "admire" this kind of "hardworking" staff and even take it as their own learning goal. If the leading organs do not conduct in-depth research, they are likely to be deceived by these "busy" and "hardworking" phenomena and relax their attention to this kind of bureaucracy.

    Why is it still "bureaucracy" after being "hardworking"? Because the essence of bureaucracy is being detached from reality and the masses. "Being idle all day long" is, of course, being detached from reality and the masses. However, if those who are "hardworking" and "busy" all day long are trapped in the abyss of事務ism (roughly translated as preoccupation with administrative details) and know nothing about the basic problems in actual work and the lives of the masses, and work blindly and piecemeal, no matter how hard they work, they are essentially still bureaucrats.

    "Hardworking bureaucracy" is the main tendency in the work style of our cadres at this stage. It is the most harmful and should attract the attention of all Party members and cadres. Why didn't the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant pay sufficient attention to so much valuable data for a long time, and why did the former North China People's Government Enterprise Department and the North China Iron and Steel Company not have policy instructions for such an important factory? Is it that they don't value the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant? No, they generally pay attention, but daily affairs absorbed all or most of their energy, and as a result, they abandoned or relaxed the most important problems, thus causing serious consequences.

    The method of opposing bureaucracy, in addition to general education, is mainly inspection—systematic, focused, in-depth, and public inspection. Only through inspection can we expose serious shortcomings and errors in our work, can those who commit bureaucratic problems be shocked, can we guide them to analyze the reasons for committing bureaucratic problems, and take practical measures to improve their work. The work of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has made significant progress after inspection, which is a good example.

    In all our work departments, we should conduct good inspections to see if there is bureaucracy, and in particular, we should pay attention to checking for "hardworking bureaucracy."

### 严格检查官僚主义

　　严格检查官僚主义
    本报今日发表了石景山钢铁厂大检查前后情况，这一个事实，很清楚地说明了官僚主义的危害，说明了只有认真的检查，才能揭发与纠正官僚主义的错误，改进我们的工作。
    官僚主义并不只是“饱食终日、无所用心”这样一种形式，这种官僚主义是显而易见的。这种官僚主义不容易在人民政府下公开生存和发展。在革命队伍中容易发生和繁殖的是另外一种官僚主义，即石景山钢铁厂自我检讨时所承认的那种“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义”。这种官僚主义不是不肯工作，而是很努力工作；不是闲，而是忙；不是一味追求个人享受，而往往是刻苦奋斗。政治经验不多的群众，往往会“崇拜”这种“辛辛苦苦”的工作人员，甚至以之作为自己学习的目标。领导机关如果不深入研究，很可能被这些“忙忙碌碌”、“辛辛苦苦”的现象所蒙蔽，放松了对这种官僚主义的注意。
    “辛辛苦苦”了，为什么还是“官僚主义”呢？因为官僚主义的本质是脱离实际与脱离群众，“饱食终日”，当然是脱离实际与脱离群众的；然而终日“辛辛苦苦”、“忙忙碌碌”的人，如果他陷于事务主义的深渊，对于实际工作中与群众生活中的基本问题毫无所知，盲目地、枝枝节节地工作，不管他如何辛苦，实质上仍然是官僚主义。
    “辛辛苦苦的官僚主义”是现阶段我们干部作风中主要倾向，为害最大，应引起全体党员与干部的注意。石景山钢铁厂为什么对于这样多的宝贵资料长期没有加以充分的注意，而前华北人民政府企业部与华北钢铁公司对于这样重要的工厂为什么也没有方针指示呢？是不是他们都不重视石景山钢铁厂呢？不是的，他们也一般地注意的，但是，日常事务吸着了他们全部或大部分精力，结果他们把最主要的问题放弃或放松了，于是造成了严重的后果。
    反对官僚主义的方法，除一般教育之外，主要就是检查，有系统的、有重点的、深入的、公开的检查。经过检查才能揭露工作中严重的缺点和错误，才能使犯官僚主义毛病的人触目惊心，才能引导他们去分析犯官僚主义毛病的原因，并采取实际改进工作的办法。石景山钢铁厂经过检查之后，工作有了很显著的进步，就是很好的例证。
    在我们一切工作部门中，都应当好好检查，看看有没有官僚主义，特别是要注意检查有没有“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义”。
