The Ministry of Interior Affairs Cares for Spring Ploughing Production
Circular Orders Suspension of Transferring Remains of Martyrs' Families

[News from this newspaper] To avoid affecting the spring ploughing production of the masses, the Ministry of Interior Affairs of the Central People's Government issued Order Nei You No. 87 on March 9th, stipulating that all transfers of the remains of martyrs should be temporarily suspended from March 15th (the date of resumption of transfers will be notified separately). During the suspension period, those family members of martyrs who request transfer of remains can be politely persuaded to postpone the transfer, and no transfer permits or fees should be issued. Those who have been permitted to start the transfer before March 15th and have obtained the transfer procedures will still be transferred according to the methods for transferring the remains of martyrs.

　　内务部照顾春耕生产
    通令暂停烈属运灵
    【本报讯】中央人民政府内务部，为避免影响群众春耕生产，特于三月九日，发出内优字第八七号命令，规定自三月十五日起暂时一律停止转运烈士灵柩（准予起运日期，另候通知）。在停运期间，对烈属请求起运者，可婉言劝其暂缓搬运，并不得发给运灵证件及费用。在三月十五日以前已许其起运而取得运灵手续者，仍按烈士运灵办法转运。
