　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th: The state of Tianjin's industrial production in February is as follows: most public factories completed or exceeded their production plans; the output of private factories was slightly lower than in January. In February, public factories in Tianjin launched or continued to promote production emulation campaigns. Some factories also carried out commendation of meritorious workers and model workers, or began to implement a system of fixed quotas and responsibilities, as well as a bonus system for exceeding quotas, praising and rewarding a large number of production activists. These activities became a powerful factor in completing the February production plans. The total yarn output of the factories under the Tianjin Textile Company exceeded the planned output by more than 5%, and the cloth output exceeded it by more than 4%. The rate of first-class cloth also exceeded the company's stipulated standard of 96%. Although the Tianjin Steel Plant spent fifteen days repairing the open-hearth furnace, the output of steel ingots still caught up with the level of January; the output of rolled steel and wire rod completed this month's production plan, which was 20% higher than January. The output of sodium sulfide at the Weixin Chemical Plant exceeded the original plan by 51%, and the output of sulfide green exceeded it by 50%, with improved quality as well. The output of transformers at the No. 1 Electrical Factory exceeded the original plan by 66%. At the same time, workers at the Tianjin Refractory Materials Factory created high-alumina bricks with a fire resistance of over 1800 degrees Celsius; after workers at the Tianjin Steel Plant switched to new methods of production, the output of electrodes increased fivefold. In the private factory sector, some factories have followed the example of the Dongya Enterprise Company in establishing labor-management consultation meetings, beginning to abolish the humiliating body search system and further improve labor-management relations. Dongya Company's sack output in February increased by 11% compared to January. The output of flat glass at the Yaohua Glass Factory has also completed its plan. However, the output of most private factories was slightly lower than in January; the main reasons were that workers' production enthusiasm was relatively relaxed around the Spring Festival and the number of requests for leave increased. The use of inferior raw cotton in February by the Beiyang, Hengyuan, and Dasheng Cotton Mills was also a reason for the decrease in output.

### 天津市二月份工业生产  公营厂大部超过计划

　　天津市二月份工业生产
    公营厂大部超过计划
    【新华社天津五日电】二月份的天津工业生产情况是：公营工厂大部完成或超过了生产计划；私营工厂的产量较一月份则略有降低。天津各公营工厂在二月份内均曾开展或继续推进了生产竞赛运动，有些工厂并进行评功评模范工作，或开始实行定员负责制和超额奖励制，表扬和嘉奖了大批的生产积极分子。这些工作，成为二月份完成生产计划的有力因素。天津中纺公司所属各厂纱的总产量超过计划产量百分之五强，布的产量超过百分之四强，正布率也超过了该公司百分之九十六的规定标准。天津制钢厂虽因修理马丁炉化费了十五天的时间，但钢锭的产量仍追上了一月份的水平；轧钢、盘条的产量则完成了较一月份尚高百分之二十的本月生产计划。维新化学厂硫化碱的产量超过原计划百分之五十一，硫化青超过百分之五十，质量亦有提高。电工一厂变压器的产量超过原计划百分之六十六，同时，天津耐火器材厂工人并创制了耐火度在一千八百度以上的高铝砖；天津制钢厂工人改用新法制造后，电极使产量提高了五倍。私营工厂方面，有些厂已继东亚企业公司之后成立了劳资协商会议，开始废除了侮辱工人人格的搜身制度，进一步改进了劳资关系。东亚公司二月份的麻袋产量较一月份提高了百分之十一。耀华玻璃厂的平面玻璃产量也已完成计划。但是多数私营工厂的产量，均比一月份略有降低；主要原因是春节前后工人生产情绪较为松懈、请假人数增多。北洋、恒源、达生三纱厂二月份中使用次等原棉生产，亦是使产量减低的原因。
