New Look of Agriculture in Heilongjiang
    ——On the Heilongjiang Provincial Agricultural Exhibition
    Wang Zuntao

    Recently, Heilongjiang Province held an agricultural exhibition. Agricultural labor models and others who visited the exhibition have become increasingly confident in the province's goal of producing 17.8 million shi of grain this year. The exhibition used vivid and practical facts to show everyone that Heilongjiang Province, as the granary of the Northeast, already possesses excellent conditions for increasing production after land reform and two years of the Great Production Movement.

    Grain output increases year by year.

    Grain output is obviously increasing year by year with the expansion of cultivated land area and the improvement of cultivation techniques. In 1949, the cultivated land area reached 38,578,000 mu, an increase of 1,776,000 mu compared to 1948. Although the province suffered from natural disasters last year, it still harvested 14,641,721 shi of grain, an increase of 1,112,441 shi compared to 1948. According to this proportion, the planned output for the province's 39,600,000 mu of cultivated land in 1950 is only 610,000 tons less than the highest level of 45 million mu in 1943.

    The majority of farmers paid widespread attention to fertilization and intensive cultivation in last year's agricultural production. In 1949, the area cultivated (weeding) and hoed (earthing up) in the province created an unprecedented record, with more than 75 percent of the total cultivated land area being cultivated and hoed three or more times. Wang Jiude, a farmer in Xinjian Village, Qing'an County, fertilized all 35 mu of his land twice and harvested 32 shi and 3 dou of grain. Compared with the output of ordinary farmers, this increased by nearly double. The Wang Zhongyou model team in Dedu County cultivated 270 mu of land, and because they paid attention to fertilization and were meticulous and timely in summer weeding, they averaged one shi of grain per mu, exceeding the normal yield by 88.2%. These achievements attracted the attention of the audience at the exhibition. However, there are many such examples in Heilongjiang Province. Changing backward and crude seed selection methods and promoting scientific new seed selection methods have been gradually accepted by farmers since 1949 under the advocacy of governments at all levels. Ding Fu, a farmer in Qingshi Village, Dedu, led everyone in field selection of grain seeds, and the village's millet averaged one shi per mu. In the past year, in addition to the government's active purchase and exchange of improved varieties, the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station has also focused its efforts on purifying and propagating improved varieties and developing new varieties. It is expected that the purification of major crop varieties such as wheat and soybeans will be achieved throughout the province within three years.

    Technical transformation work, like vigorous new shoots, is growing.

    The improvement of cultivation has broken through the circle of outdated and backward technology, and the work of technical transformation is growing like vigorous new shoots. In the entire province, in just the past one or two years, 23 types of improved agricultural tools have been created by hardworking farmers. The Nehe seeder, which has been identified and promoted by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, is the result of the meticulous creation of Xu Youcai, a farmer in Nehe County, with the help of the county's Agricultural Experiment Station. The Fumin weeder manufactured by the Keshan Fumin Iron Factory saves labor in weeding and can also earth up at the same time, which has been universally praised by labor models. This year, the province will promote more than 8,000 of these improved agricultural tools. Soviet-made new-style horse-drawn agricultural machinery will also be used in key pilot projects this year in a planned manner.

    The water conservancy projects in various areas along the river in 1949 were quite moving. The photos recorded the real tragedy of the rural areas on both sides of the Tao'er River that suffered from floods in 1948, but more models and charts depicted the great achievements in flood control last year. The province mobilized 1.7 million river workers to repair dikes and dig ditches, and organized joint flood prevention, reducing the area affected by floods from 280,000 qing in the previous year to more than 1,000 qing last year. What farmers were equally grateful for last year, along with leading water management, was the work of preventing and controlling animal epidemics. Thanks to the government's organization of a large number of veterinarians to go to the countryside, the number of horses that died from mange has dropped from 304 in 1948 to 36 last year.

    Labor mutual aid has played a huge promoting role

    The achievements in various aspects of agricultural production are inextricably linked to the effectiveness of organization. Without the leadership and promotion of labor mutual aid organizations, it is difficult to achieve agricultural improvement. By leveraging the power of organization, labor efficiency has been improved, cultivation methods have been improved, and the cultivated area has also been expanded. The Wang Zhijian production team, a special-class model in Nehe County, obtained a harvest equivalent to medium-grade land under inferior land conditions, and opened up eight qing of wasteland. The Li Jinzhang team harvested 50 shi of grain per labor force, which was 20 shi more than the single-handed labor force. The many model production mutual aid groups that continue to emerge fully demonstrate with their facts of intensive cultivation and more grain production that organization is not only a way to overcome the difficulty of animal power, but also a great way to get rich.

　　黑龙江农业新面貌
    ——记黑龙江省农业展览会
    王遵佗
    最近黑龙江省举行了一次农业展览会，参观了这个展览会的农业劳动模范和其他的人们，都愈益加强了对今年全省争取产粮一千七百八十万石的信心。展览内容以生动实际的事实告诉了大家，作为东北谷仓的黑龙江省，在土地改革后又经过了两年的大生产运动，现在已经具备了优越的增产条件。
    粮食产量，一年比一年增加。
    粮食的产量，随着耕地面积的扩大与耕作技术的提高。显然是一年比一年增加。一九四九年的耕地面积达到三千八百五十七万八千亩，较一九四八年增加一百七十七万六千亩。去年虽一度遭受天灾，但全省仍打粮一千四百六十四万一千七百二十一石，比一九四八年增加一百十一万二千四百四十一石。按照这个比例，一九五○年全省耕地面积三千九百六十万亩的计划产量，距离一九四三年最高水平四千五百余万亩的产量，相差只有六十一万余吨了。
    广大农民在去年农业生产中，已经普遍地注意施肥和精耕细作。一九四九年全省铲（锄草）趟（培土）的面积创造了空前的纪录，三铲三趟以上的达到总耕地面积的百分之七十五强。庆安县新建村农民王久德种三十五亩地，全部上两遍粪，打了三十二石三斗粮。这与一般农民的产量比较，增加了将近一倍。德都县王忠有模范小组计种二百七十亩地，由于注意上粪，夏锄时又细致、又及时，平均每亩打粮一石，超过常年产量八十八点二。这些事迹在展览会上都引起了观众的注意。但这种事例在黑龙江省内还有许多。改变落后粗糙的选种方法，提倡科学的新选种方法，从一九四九年起在各级人民政府倡导下，逐渐被农民接受了。德都青石村农民丁富领导大家进行田间采选谷种，全村谷子平均每亩打了一石。一年来，除人民政府积极收购和交流优良品种以外，省农事试验场还以主要力量进行着纯化繁殖优良品种和育成新品种的工作。预计三年内将在全省范围内达到小麦、大豆等主要作物品种的纯化。
    技术改造工作像茁壮的新芽，正在成长。
    耕作的提高冲破了陈腐落后的技术圈子，技术的改造工作像茁壮的新芽，正在成长。全省仅在最近一、二年内，从辛勤的农民手中，就已创造了改良农具二十三种。经省农林厅鉴定推广的讷河号播种机，就是讷河县农民徐有才在该县农事试验场帮助下的精心创造。克山福民铁工厂制造的福民号锄草机，锄草省工又能同时培土，得到了劳动模范的普遍称赞。今年全省将要推广这些改良农具八千余台。苏联制的新式马拉机械农具也将在今年有步骤地重点试用。
    一九四九年沿河各地的治水工程是相当动人的，照片纪录了一九四八年洮儿河两岸农村遭受水灾的真实惨状，但更多的模型和简表描绘出去年治水防汛的巨大成绩。全省动员了一百七十万河工修堤挖沟，组织联防防汛，使遭受水灾的面积由前年的二十八万垧降至去年的一千余垧。去年一年中，与领导治水同样为农民感激的是防治畜疫的工作。由于政府组织大批兽医下乡，因长癞而死亡的马匹，已由一九四八年的三百零四匹，降至去年的三十六匹。
    劳动互助组织起了极大的推动作用
    农业生产中各方面成绩的获得，与组织起来的功效有着不可分离的关系。没有劳动互助组织的领导与推动，农业的提高是难以实现的。由于发挥了组织起来的力量，劳动效率提高了，耕作方法改善了，耕地面积也扩大了。讷河县特等模范王志俭生产小组在劣等土地的条件下，得到了中等土地的收获量，并且开了八垧荒地。李金章小组每个劳动力打粮五十石，较单干的劳动力多打了二十石。不断涌现的许多模范生产互助组，都以他们精耕细作多打粮的事实充分说明，组织起来不但是克服畜力困难的办法，而且是发家致富的大道。
