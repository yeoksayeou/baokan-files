　　Improve Tricycle Registration Procedures!
　　Editor:
　　We are a group of tricycle workers, and we have a few opinions on this tricycle registration, which we hope can be disclosed for the reference of relevant authorities.
　　Our registration location is in Ma Xiang Hutong, Xizhimen Street. Judging from the registration situation yesterday and today, we feel that there are many inconveniences in the procedures.
　　Yesterday (the 3rd), we all rode our tricycles to Ma Xiang Hutong early in the morning, dragging our vehicles and queuing up. We didn't get an inspection certificate until after noon. We dragged the tricycles out of the crowd and queued up again in the courtyard, waiting for inspection. However, just when it was almost our turn, the staff announced, "The porcelain plates are gone, bring your vehicles again tomorrow." At that time, it was only 3:30 in the afternoon, so we had to go back. Some of our companions in front of us had their vehicles inspected, but because they didn't have porcelain plates, they were told to bring their vehicles back the next day. They requested, "Since the vehicle has been inspected, it is not necessary to bring the vehicle again." However, the staff refused, and after repeated arguments, they got the reply: "You can bring it if you want, or don't if you don't." Today we rode our vehicles again, and there were already more than thirty people in front. When it was almost noon, the staff announced, "Only thirty people will be registered today, and the rest will come tomorrow." This adds trouble for us. Who knows if we will have good luck with registration tomorrow? We rent the vehicles every day, and we have to pay the base fee, let alone the food and drink for our families. Therefore, we believe that the registration procedures should be:
　　1. First, issue inspection certificates, numbered on the certificate, stipulating that they must be collected within three or five days. Set up more windows for issuing certificates.
　　2. The day after the deadline for collecting certificates, announce the daily inspection numbers, times, and locations in the People's Daily. Tricycle drivers only need to see their inspection certificate number to ride their vehicles to the inspection on the specified date, so that they don't have the pain of going every day and failing to get inspected. If you are worried that the tricycle drivers don't read the newspaper, you can also ask the Public Security Comrades to broadcast at the street corners with loudspeakers.
　　3. On the same day as the vehicle inspection, the porcelain plates can be issued to the vehicles with no problems.
　　The above three methods are very simple and easy to implement. In this way, the inconveniences we are currently encountering can be completely avoided, and the staff will no longer feel headaches in maintaining order and the chaos of the work.
　　If there is another registration next time, we suggest that it is best to work jointly with the Tax Bureau, and complete the donation and tax procedures and the license plate issuance at one time. As long as you prepare more in advance, this is not difficult to do.

### 改进三轮车登记手续！

　　改进三轮车登记手续！编辑先生：
    我们是一群三轮车工人，对这次办理三轮车登记有几点意见，希望能够披露，以供有关当局参考。
    我们的登记地点，是在西直门大街马相胡同。从昨天和今天的登记情形看来，深感手续上有许多不方便。
    昨天（三日）我们一早就各自蹬车到达了马相胡同，拖着车排着队，一直到中午以后才领得一张检验证。我们把车从人群里拖了出来，又到院子里重新排队，等候验车。可是，快轮到我们时，工作人员却宣布说：“瓷牌没有了，明天再带车来验”。那时，还只是下午三时半，我们只好回去。在我们前面有几位同伴，车是验过了，但也因没有瓷牌，要他第二天拖着车再去领。他们要求：“既已验过了车，就可以不必再带车来”。可是工作人员却不准，经再三争执，才得到：“你们爱拖来就拖来，不爱拖来就作罢”的答复。今天我们又蹬着车去，前面已有三十多个人，排到快近中午的时候，工作人员却宣布：“今天只登记三十名，其余的明天再来。”这样，就给我们增加麻烦。谁知道明天是否能碰上登记的好运气呢？我们每天租的车，是照例要车底钱的，何况一家老小的吃喝呢？因此，我们认为，在登记的手续上，应该：
    一、先领检验证，证上编号，规定三天或五天领完。发证时多设几个窗口。
    二、领证截止后的第二天，在人民日报上公布每日检验的号数、时间和地点。蹬三轮车的人，只要看清他的检验证号码，即可在所规定的日期内蹬车去检验，不致有天天去天天验不上的痛苦。如果耽心三轮车夫不看报，还可以请公安同志在各十字街口用扬声筒广播。
    三、在验车的同一天，即可同时对无问题的车发给瓷牌。
    以上这三个办法，很简单易办。这样我们目前所遇到的不方便既可以完全免掉，而工作人员也不致再感到维持秩序的头疼和工作的杂乱了。
    如果下一届要登记，我们建议最好与税务局联合办公，一次就把捐税的手续和领牌照的手续办完。只要在事前多加准备，这是不难办到。
