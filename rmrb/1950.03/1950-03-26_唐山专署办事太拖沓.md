Tangshan Prefecture Office Works Too Slowly
　　A case involving the return of wrongfully confiscated industrial and commercial property has been shuffled back and forth between county government, commissioner's office, provincial government, and special brewing company a total of nine times. After further discussion and investigation, it remains unresolved after more than four months.
　　Editor:
　　I am a communications officer from the 198th Division, originally from Heizha Village, Leting, Hebei. About eight li from my home, in Hujiazhai Town, there is a Yongheshun distillery and general store co-invested by twelve shareholders, with my father, Wei Xinran, as the manager. The capital was 709.5 shares (each share being approximately 300+ jin of corn). My family held 120 shares. The shareholders' class composition was: eight landlords, two middle peasants, one rich peasant, and one poor peasant.

　　Business began in 1941. During the land reform in eastern Hebei in June 1947, the general store's goods and burlap sacks were distributed to the peasants. In January 1948, the machinery, such as a rice mill, an eight-horsepower diesel engine, and brewing tinware, were taken over by the cadres of the special brewing company led by Liu Zhiyi (the former county head of Leting) of the Ludong Special District (i.e., the area south of the Beining Railway, now merged into Tangshan Prefecture).

　　Due to the severe flooding in eastern Hebei, I took leave last November to deal with family matters. I went to the Industry and Commerce Section Chief of Leting County Government to request the return of the distillery's property. The Section Chief replied, "It was directly confiscated by the Prefecture Office," and referred me to the Prefecture Office. The Industry and Commerce Section Chief of the Prefecture Office believed that it could be returned according to the policy of not infringing on industry and commerce. However, because there were many shareholders, it needed to be investigated whether they were all at home. He then referred me back to the County Government. After certifications from various villages, all twelve shareholders were present. The County Government agreed to return it to the original owners and referred me back to the Prefecture Office. However, Director Wang of the Prefecture Office Secretariat said, "The distillery was taken over by the provincial special brewing company, so you need to go to the province." He then referred me to the Provincial Department of Commerce. The Provincial Department of Commerce did not understand the situation and referred me back to the Prefecture Office for handling. The Prefecture Office then referred me to the special brewing company. After talking with Director Lu of the Tangshan special brewing company, it was decided that it needed to be discussed with the province before handling. Later, Director Lu returned from the province and told us, "We have already handed it over to the Prefecture Office. Please go to the Prefecture Office to handle it." At this time, my leave expired and I returned to the unit, entrusting someone to handle the matter. After a Section Chief Yao of the Prefecture Office talked with the agent, he said that an investigation was needed and that we would be notified later. It has now been four months. My unit's political department has sent three official letters to the Tangshan Prefecture Office, urging them to deal with the matter, but they have been like stones sinking into the sea, never receiving a reply. Letters sent by my family to the Tangshan Prefecture Office are also not answered. Now the unit is busy with the Great Production campaign, and I am unwilling to take leave again. Please help me to have the relevant authorities resolve this.

　　Editor's Note: The issue raised by reader Shi Ping demonstrates that the division of responsibilities among our administrative organs is not yet clear enough, leading to the "referral" of the party concerned back and forth without resolution. At the same time, it also shows that some staff members of some organs still have an irresponsible attitude towards the people and have very low work efficiency, so that "investigations" are carried out, but in the end, there is no news.

　　We hope that the Tangshan Prefecture Office will resolve this specific issue quickly and publicly respond to Shi Ping's request. At the same time, we hope that agencies with similar situations will pay attention to this problem.

### 唐山专署办事太拖沓

　　唐山专署办事太拖沓
    有一件发还被错误没收的工商业的事，在县政府、专员公署、省政府、专烧公司等机关之间，转来转去，达九次之多，再经过讨论、调查，四个多月了还没解决。
        编辑同志：
    我是一九八师的通讯干事，原籍河北乐亭黑垞村人，在距我家八里路胡家垞镇由股东十二人合资，我父亲魏欣然作经理开有永和顺烧锅杂货店。股本是七百零九个半股（每股一石玉米约计市斤三百多斤）我家股是一百二十个。股东成份：地主八家、中农两家、富农一家、贫农一家。
    营业系于一九四一年开始。一九四七年六月间，冀东进行土改，杂货业的货物以及麻袋等物被农民分了，机器如：碾米机、八马力柴油机、烧酒锡器……等在一九四八年一月间由冀东路南专区（即北宁路以南地区，现已并入唐山专区）刘志一（原乐亭县长）带领专烧公司的干部接收过去。
    由于冀东水灾严重，去年十一月我请假回家处理家庭生活。我找乐亭县政府工商科长，请求发还烧锅店产业，当时工商科长答复：“是专署直接没收的。”把我介绍到专署。专署工商科长认为，按不侵犯工商业政策可以发还。但由于股东多，是否都在家需要调查。又把我介绍到县政府。经过各村的证明，十二个股东都在。县政府的意见同意发还原主，把我又介绍到专署。可是专署秘书室王主任说：“烧锅店是被省的专烧公司接收过去，需要到省。”又把我介绍到省商业厅。省商业厅不了解情况，又把我介绍回专署处理。专署又把我介绍到专烧公司。经唐山专烧公司路主任谈，需要到省讨论后再处理。后来路主任从省里回来，告诉我们说：“我们已交到专署了，你们到专署办理吧。”此时我假满回到部队，托一个人代理这事。经专署一位姚科长和代理人谈，需要调查，容后通知。现在已有四个月了，我部政治部曾给唐山专署去了三封公函，催问处理情况，可是如石沉大海，始终没有回信。家里给唐山专署去信，也不答复。现在部队正忙于大生产，我也不愿意再请假。请你们帮我转有关机关解决。
      一九八师政治部史平（原名魏殿科）
    编者按：读者史平所提出的问题，表现了我们的行政机关间职责的划分还不够明确，以至把当事人“介绍”来“介绍”去，依然不得解决。同时，也表现了一些机关工作人员尚存在着对人民不负责的态度，工作效率很低，以至于“调查”来“调查”去，最后渺无消息。
    我们希望唐山专署从速解决并公开答复史平所提的这个具体问题。同时，希望有同样情形的机关注意这个问题。
