Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: Pravda published an editorial on the 12th stating: Today is a great festival for the entire Soviet Union. The heroic, victorious, and creative Soviet people are electing the highest organ of power in their country—the Supreme Soviet. Our people's boundless love for the socialist motherland and their strong unity with the Communist Party are vividly manifested in the election campaign. The Soviet people nominated Stalin as the first candidate for representative and nominated the comrades-in-arms of the great Stalin—the leaders of the Party and the government—as candidates. The candidates of the Stalinist Party and the Non-Party League are all loyal patriots of the Soviet Union who have won the high trust of the people through self-sacrificing efforts for the victory of communism.
　　Today, the Soviet people are going to the polls with joy to fulfill their glorious responsibility. At this solemn moment, they recall with justifiable pride the glorious path of victory that the Soviet people have experienced under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party. Today, voters are casting their votes for the candidates of the Party and non-Party members in order to further consolidate and prosper our glorious socialist motherland. Voters are casting their votes for the candidates of the Party and non-Party League for the improvement of the welfare of our people and for a happier and more fulfilling life for the Soviet people.
　　The capitalist world is in chaos and panic. Overseas imperialists, intoxicated with the dream of world hegemony, are trying to ignite the flames of a new war. The bourgeoisie wants to find a way out of the economic panic in military adventures and shift the burden of panic onto the shoulders of the working people. Unemployment and poverty of the broad masses are increasing. Our great socialist motherland is guiding all working people to the lighthouse of the road to happiness. Today, millions of working people in capitalist countries are increasingly recognizing that there is only one road to freedom and happiness, and that is the road of socialism. Voters vote for the candidates of the Party and the Non-Party League, which is also a vote in support of the Soviet Union's wise Stalinist foreign policy, in support of lasting peace between nations, and in support of the expansion and consolidation of the international front of peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　斯大林党与非党联盟候选人
    赢得苏联人民高度信任
    真理报在选举日发表社论
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日真理报发表社论称：今天是苏联全国的伟大节日。英雄的、胜利的、富于创造性的苏联人民，正在选举他们国家的最高权力机关——最高苏维埃。我国人民对于社会主义祖国的无限热爱，以及他们与共产党的强固的团结，生动地表现在选举运动中。苏联人民提名斯大林为第一名代表候选人，并提名伟大斯大林的战友——党与政府的领袖们为候选人。斯大林党与非党联盟的候选人都是为了共产主义的胜利，而以自我牺牲的努力赢得人民高度信任的苏维埃忠诚的爱国者。
    今天，苏维埃人民怀着愉快的心情到投票站去执行他们光荣的责任。在这庄严的时刻，他们怀着正当的骄傲，追忆着苏维埃人民在列宁——斯大林党的领导下，所经历的光荣的胜利的道路。今天选民们投党与非党候选人的票，就是为了我们光荣的社会主义祖国的进一步巩固与繁荣。选民们投党与非党候选人的票，就是为了我国人民福利的增进、为了苏维埃人民的更幸福和更美满的生活。
    资本主义世界正陷于混乱和恐慌。海外帝国主义者们沉醉于世界霸权的迷梦，企图煽起新战争的大火。资产阶级想在军事冒险之中找寻摆脱经济恐慌的出路，并将恐慌的重担转嫁到劳动人民肩上。广大群众的失业和贫困在增加着。我们伟大的社会主义祖国却指引着全体劳动人民走向幸福之路的灯塔。今天，资本主义国家里千百万的劳动人民正越来越认清了：通向自由和幸福的道路只有一条，这便是社会主义的道路。选民们投票选举党和非党联盟候选人，也便是投票拥护苏联英明的斯大林外交政策，拥护国际间的持久和平，拥护国际和平、民主及社会主义阵线的扩大与巩固。
