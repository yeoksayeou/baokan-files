　　Political and Legal Affairs Committee and Affiliated Departments:
    Streamline Organization, Strengthen Work Efficiency
    Prioritize Key Personnel Allocation Based on Workload
    [Our Newspaper] The Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and its affiliated departments have made some achievements in reorganizing agencies and strengthening work. Since the beginning of January this year, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee and its affiliated departments have conducted multiple studies and adjustments to their organizational structures. In the initial studies, it was found that some agencies had very large organizational plans, failing to allocate cadres with a focus on the importance and urgency of tasks while also considering manpower and financial resources. Moreover, the structure was large and had many layers. For example, from departments and bureaus down to sections, offices, and units, to the staff members and clerks doing specific work, there were as many as five levels. Additionally, some divisions of labor were inappropriate, creating mutual constraints, uneven workloads, inflexible work operations, and relatively reduced efficiency. Some agencies had more administrative staff than professional staff. Most cadres were busy with administrative affairs, while few were truly engaged in professional work, which inevitably weakened professional capabilities and work effectiveness. Furthermore, new cadres generally accounted for two-thirds of the workforce, lacking intermediate-level backbone personnel, which partially resulted in a situation where superiors were busy while subordinates were idle, and there was a disconnect between the upper and lower levels.
    In response to this situation, in accordance with the principles of streamlining and the current needs and possibilities, appropriate reorganizations have been carried out after multiple studies.
    This reorganization is not simply for the purpose of reducing redundant personnel. Although one of the goals of streamlining is to save expenses, the more important aspect is to strengthen work. Therefore, the focus of this reorganization is on: consolidating institutions, reducing layers, strengthening professional capabilities, and improving work efficiency. The specific implementation is as follows:
    1. Allocate cadres with a focus on the importance and urgency of tasks and the source of cadres, and pay attention to the flexible use of personnel. For example, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee's agencies transferred a group of cadres engaged in documentation and administrative work from various departments and sections to participate in the professional work of the Counselor's Office. Additionally, through various means, leading cadres from the General Office and other departments were organized to participate in professional research work. For example, the Ministry of Justice adopted a method of collective research and approval of reports by department-level cadres to solve the difficulties of handling cases solely by the responsible sections and departments.
    2. Below the General Office and department level, generally only sections are established, and departments are temporarily not established (such as the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Legislative Affairs Committee, and the Ministry of Justice). Although some departments have the title of director above the section level, for the sake of convenience, the working institutions of the departments are not actually established, and the departments and the General Office work together in a centralized manner (such as the Political and Legal Affairs Committee). Sections with similar tasks and small workloads are merged; generally, units below the section level are eliminated. In this way, not only is the organization streamlined, but also the concentration and flexible use of strength is achieved, which improves work efficiency.
    3. Inspections were conducted to "oppose the old ways of working in government agencies," and various systems were re-established. Administrative work was simplified, and appropriate personnel were transferred to professional research work. This also streamlined the organization of administrative agencies and relatively expanded and enriched the organization of professional agencies. In addition, there are many more personnel that can be streamlined. For example, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee's agencies originally had ten messengers. After this reorganization, it was proposed to make full use of urban postal services and telephones. After a half-month trial, the messenger team voluntarily proposed reducing six people. Secondly, due to the establishment of a dormitory management system and the simplification of office service work, the number of service personnel generally does not exceed one to ten compared to the number of cadres. Those who are redundant will be properly安置 or ordered to participate in spare-time training classes according to the actual situation.
    4. Due to the lack of backbone personnel in the political and legal departments, methods such as "taking on apprentices," going to the countryside for practical training, and organizing spare-time learning in agencies were adopted to cultivate worker-peasant and young intellectual cadres, in order to rapidly improve their political and cultural levels. Although a small portion of the actual number of personnel is not currently necessary, they should not be reduced but should remain within the organization for further cultivation.
    After reorganization according to the above spirit, although a considerable number of cadres were drawn to participate in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing (the Political and Legal Affairs Committee alone drew one-fourth of its cadres to the countryside, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice also drew a portion), due to the reduction of layers, simplification of procedures, and the organization of on-the-job cadre learning, work has begun to improve. Facts have proven that after work efficiency improves, it will inevitably enable the organization to gradually become more streamlined.

### 政法委员会及所属各部会  精简编制加强工作效率  按照工作轻重缓急有重点配备干部

　　政法委员会及所属各部会
    精简编制加强工作效率   
    按照工作轻重缓急有重点配备干部
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院政法委员会及其所属各部会对于整编机关，加强工作，已取得一些成绩。自今年一月开始，政法委员会及所属各部即对其编制进行了多次的研究调整。在研究中，最初发现有些机关编制计划很大，未能根据业务轻重缓急并照顾人力财力条件有重点地配备干部。而且架子大，层次多，如厅、司之下所设处、科、股，到做具体工作的科员、办事员，便有五级之多。加以有些分工不适当，互相牵制，忙闲不均，工作运转不灵，效率相对减低。有些机关行政事务人员多于业务工作人员。多数干部忙于行政事务，真正做业务工作的人少，必然削弱业务和工作效能。此外，新干部一般是占三分之二，缺少中级骨干，部分地产生了上忙下闲，上下脱节的现象。
    针对此种情况，按照精简原则及目前的需要与可能，经过多次研究，进行了适当的整编。
    此次整编，不是单纯地为了裁减冗员。精简的目的之一虽然是为了节省开支，但更其重要的是加强工作。因此，这次整编的着眼点是放在：紧缩机构，减少层次，加强业务和提高工作效率。其具体实施是：
    一、按照工作的轻重缓急与干部来源，有重点地配备干部；并注意人员的机动使用。例如政法委员会机关在各处、科抽调一批从事文牍及行政工作的干部参加参事室的业务工作外，并通过各种方式将办公厅及其他处负责干部组织到业务研究工作中去。例如司法部采取司级干部集体研究批答报告的办法，解决单由主管科司批办的困难。
    二、办公厅及司级以下，一般暂设科、不设处（如政法委员会、法制委员会及司法部）。有些部门在科以上虽有处长名义，但为办事便利，实际上不设处的工作机构，处与办公厅集中办公（如政法委员会）。工作相近、业务不多的科，加以合并；科以下一般地取消了股。如此，不但精简了编制，而且做到集中与机动地使用力量，提高了工作效率。
    三、进行了“反对机关工作老一套”的检查，重新建立了各种制度。简化事务行政工作，抽调适当人员转到业务研究工作方面去。这样也就紧缩了行政机构编制，相对地扩大与充实了业务机构的编制。此外，还有许多人员可以精简。例如政委机关原有通讯员十人，此次整编提出充分利用城市邮政及电话等办法，经半月试行后，通讯班便自动提出减少六人。其次，因建立宿舍管理制度，并精简办公室勤务工作，服务员人数与干部人数相比，一般不超过一与十之比，多余者依实际情形予以适当安置或令其参加业余学校补习班。
    四、由于政法部门工作骨干的缺乏，为培养工农及青年知识分子干部，采用了“带徒弟”、下乡锻炼和组织机关业余学习等方式，以求迅速提高政治、文化水平。实际编制人员有一小部分虽非目前必需，但不宜裁减，仍应留在编制之内加以培养。
    根据以上精神加以整编后，虽抽出相当多的干部参加京郊土改（仅政法委员会本机关即抽出了四分之一干部下乡，内务、司法两部也抽出一部），但由于层次减少、手续简化，并组织了在职干部学习，工作已开始提高。事实证明：工作效率提高之后，必然可使机构逐渐更加精简。
