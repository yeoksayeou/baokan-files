　　Decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
    Expansion of Tianjin-Guan District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau
    [By Our Staff Reporter] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has decided to expand the Tianjin-Guan District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau into the Bohai Agricultural Reclamation Bureau. After a year of restoration and development, the reclamation scope of the Tianjin-Guan District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau has gradually expanded, reaching Shanhaiguan in the north and the mouth of the Yellow River in the south. It has now established the Gaoliquan and Huanghua state-owned farms, eleven agricultural zone farms including Junliangcheng and Xiaozhan, the Jiyunhe District Tractor Station, and the Junliangcheng Electric Motor Straw Bag Factory. Recently, in order to expand alkali wasteland reclamation and strengthen agricultural affairs leadership, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has decided to expand the Tianjin-Guan District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau into the Bohai District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau. It also instructed that, in order to take care of the farmers' lives in the agricultural reclamation area and balance the burden, farmers' land use fees and electricity surcharges should be abolished, and only water conservancy management fees should be collected. In addition, the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the Cooperative Bank have allocated 20 million catties of millet as the bureau's 1950 in-kind loan expenses. The bureau is now actively preparing agricultural loans, and the estimated loan amount is: more than 15 million catties of bean cake, more than 6 million catties of ammonium sulfate, 630 large barrels of diesel, more than 140,000 catties of spring wheat seeds, more than 19,000 catties of cotton seeds, and more than 7.2 million catties of manure (first batch). Special care will be given to farmers in disaster areas during the loan disbursement. At present, the Spring Festival has passed, and each farm has conveyed the 1950 production plan to the farmers, and is actively surveying the land to prepare for spring plowing.

    津沽区农垦管理局扩大
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部决定：津沽区农垦管理局扩大为渤海农垦管理局。津沽区农垦管理局经过一年来的恢复与发展，垦殖范围已逐渐扩大，北迄山海关，南至黄河口。现已建立高里圈、黄骅两国营农场，军粮城、小站等十一个农区农场，蓟运河区拖拉机站与军粮城电机草袋厂。近日中央人民政府农业部为了扩大碱荒垦殖加强垦务领导，特决定将津沽区农垦管理局扩大为渤海区农垦管理局。并指示：为照顾该农垦区农民生活及平衡负担，取消农民土地使用费及电气垫费等负担，只收水利管理费。另外中央农业部及合作银行还拨小米两千万斤，作为该局一九五零年度的实物贷放费用。现该局正积极准备农贷，预计贷放数量为：豆饼一千五百余万斤，硫酸錏六百余万斤，柴油六百三十大桶，春麦种十四余万斤，棉籽一万九千余斤，大粪（第一批）七百二十余万斤。贷放时对灾区的农民特别加以照顾。目前春节已过，各农场已将一九五零年生产计划传达给农民，并积极清丈土地准备进行春耕。
