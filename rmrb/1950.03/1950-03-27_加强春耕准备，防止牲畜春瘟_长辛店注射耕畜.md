　　Strengthen Spring Ploughing Preparations, Prevent Spring Cattle Plague
    Changxindian Inoculates Draught Animals
    [This newspaper dispatch] In order to strengthen spring ploughing preparations and prevent spring cattle plague, 1,056 head of livestock in the Changxindian area have been inoculated with preventative vaccinations. The Beijing Municipal Government epidemic prevention team arrived in the area on the 16th of this month and immediately went to the countryside to administer vaccinations. To ensure quick and convenient inoculation, the work was divided into four groups operating in Changxindian Town, Zhaoxindian, Liuxiayu, and Zhangguozhuang. Before the epidemic prevention team arrived in the villages, each village held widespread forums with livestock owners for publicity and mobilization. Because in the past the masses did not have the habit of inoculating livestock, there were two ideological concerns at the beginning: one was the fear of harming the livestock; the other was the fear that after the vaccinations, the livestock would not be able to work immediately, delaying production. After repeated explanations by district and village cadres that the vaccinations would definitely not harm the livestock or delay work, and with cadres taking the lead in vaccinating their own livestock, the livestock owners' ideological concerns were dispelled, and inoculation began. Out of a total of 1,317 head of livestock in the thirteen villages and one town in the district, 1,056 head were inoculated in three days, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of livestock in the district. Of the 261 head of livestock that were not inoculated, some were out transporting goods, and others could not be inoculated because they were pregnant.
    Because the publicity was relatively thorough, the masses were generally satisfied and considered it a good thing. Yu Wanqing of Changxindian Town said: "This inoculation of livestock is a great benefit. In the past, livestock would get sick every spring. Last year, my livestock got sick, and it took fifty catties of millet worth of medicine to cure it. This vaccination is beneficial for livestock epidemic prevention."

　　加强春耕准备，防止牲畜春瘟
    长辛店注射耕畜
    【本报讯】加强春耕准备，防止牲畜春瘟，长辛店区一千零五十六头牲畜已注射防疫针。京市府防疫队于本月十六日到区，当天即下乡注射。为注射迅速与方便，共分长辛店镇、赵辛店、留霞峪、张郭庄四组进行。注射疫苗有牛瘟和炭疽（俗称黄病）两种。防疫队未到村前，各村曾普遍召开牲口主座谈会进行宣传动员。因为过去群众没有给牲口注射的习惯，开始时有两种思想顾虑：一种是怕将牲口打坏了；一种是怕打过针后，牲口当时不能干活，耽误生产。经区村干部再三说明决打不坏也耽误不了干活，并由干部带头将自己的牲口注射后，才解除了牲口主的思想顾虑，开始注射。全区十三个村一个镇共有牲口一千三百一十七头，三天时间即注射了一千零五十六头，占全区牲畜总数的百分之八十。未注射的二百六十一头牲畜中，一部分是出门跑运输了，另一部分因为有了驹，不能注射。
    由于宣传比较深入，群众一般都很满意，认为这是一件好事。长辛店镇于万庆说：“这次给牲口注射好处大了，过去牲口一到春天即闹病，去年我的牲口病了，吃了五十斤小米的药才治好。这次打针对牲口防疫是有利的。”
