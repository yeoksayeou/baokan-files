　　Fully Utilizing Power Generation Equipment to Reduce Waste
    National Power Generation Could Increase by One and a Half Times
    Central Fuel Department Proposes Six Improvement Measures
    【Xinhua News Agency, 16th】Currently, there are several irrational and wasteful phenomena in the national electricity industry. If these can be overcome, the national power generation can be increased by more than one and a half times. According to statistics from the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry: currently, industrial electricity consumption is lacking in various places, while the equipment and electricity generated by power plants nationwide are not fully utilized. According to a preliminary investigation by the Northeast Electric Power Administration, the power plants under its jurisdiction alone have more than 45,000 kilowatts of intact generators that are not being used. This equipment capacity is almost equivalent to that of the largest Shijingshan Power Plant in North China. It is estimated that there must be a lot more surplus power generation equipment scattered in power plants and public enterprises, factories, and mines across the country, which are either complete or can be used with minor repairs.

    Not only that, but the power generation equipment currently in use is also not being fully utilized. This is reflected in: the conservative thinking of electricity cadres and poor power supply management, resulting in the failure to fully utilize power generation equipment.

    I. Equipment output is lower than the original equipment capacity: Last year, power plants in Northeast, North, and East China had better maintenance results due to earlier liberation and higher awareness among workers, but the annual average maximum output of the equipment only accounted for 65.1% of the original equipment capacity. This year, it is planned to increase this to 78.8%, but there is still 21.2% of equipment efficiency that has not been realized. The reason why equipment output cannot be rapidly increased is that some electricity cadres still have conservative thinking and incorrect technical viewpoints. They emphasize that the machines are old and only passively wait for new machines, rather than actively improving them through maintenance and increasing equipment output. They also have a safety-first power generation viewpoint, but they only believe that generating less power is safer, rather than simultaneously ensuring both increased output and safe power generation through planned maintenance. In addition, some cadres still have capitalist economic viewpoints, believing that increasing output to the original equipment capacity is not economical and should be stopped at a certain economic output point; they do not realize that if more factories can be supplied with production power and other various industrial productions can be developed, it would be more economical for the entire country and society.

  Currently, the equipment utilization rate is far from the reasonable level that can be achieved, and various losses are still extremely large.

    II. Equipment utilization rate is very low: This is a very serious problem at present. Calculated by time, the average utilization rate of power plants in North China last year was the highest in the country, but it only accounted for 28.4% of the total time in the year. This year, the average utilization rate of equipment in power plants across the country is planned to increase to 29.7%, but it is still far from the reasonable standard that can be achieved. Compared with Soviet standards, it is only about 40%. If the utilization rate can be increased to the due standard, the increase in electricity generated by public power plants in Northeast, North, and East China alone would exceed 1.3 times the planned electricity generation this year, which is equivalent to building a new power plant with a capacity of hundreds of thousands of kilowatts. The reason why the equipment could not be fully utilized last year was the large number of accidents, but the more important problem was poor power supply management. In the past, local electricity management bureaus lacked strict planned management for electricity consumption, so that the load was not evenly distributed over the 24 hours of the day, and the electricity consumption of each household was concentrated in a few hours, forming a high peak load, a low average load, and a small amount of electricity sold.

    III. Various losses are still very large: Last year, 3,668 accidents occurred in Northeast and North China, of which 2,124 occurred in Northeast, resulting in a loss of more than 11 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. If this electricity were used to mine coal, it could yield more than 470,000 tons of coal, which is enough for all thermal power plants in Northeast China for half a year. Accidents continue to occur this year. After the No. 6 unit of the Shijingshan Power Plant exploded and was repaired, it was discovered that the machine had been sabotaged again, but some cadres in the plant did not immediately carry out defense and inspection work and were politically paralyzed. In addition, in individual areas, self-consumption of electricity and line losses are still very serious, and in some areas, self-consumption of electricity and line losses exceed 50% of the power generation.

    Strengthen the responsibility of workers, improve management, conduct regular maintenance, and individual power plants reach 100% of the original equipment capacity.

    According to the research results of the Central Fuel Industry Department, the ways to overcome the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena are: First, strengthen the sense of responsibility for cherishing and caring for the property of the country and the people, conduct a comprehensive survey of power generation equipment, and report surplus equipment to the central government for unified allocation and rational use. Second, break the conservative thinking in technology and the incorrect viewpoint on safe power generation, and confirm that only by carrying out planned regular maintenance can equipment efficiency be improved and safe power generation be guaranteed. Third, establish a planned regular maintenance system and a special responsibility system for operation, maintenance, and management, so as to improve equipment efficiency through thorough maintenance and ensure no accidents occur. Fourth, establish a strict power supply management system. Local electricity management bureaus should sign electricity consumption contracts with local users, adjust the electricity consumption and time of each household, and implement a standby fee system (i.e., progressive charging for users' excessive electricity consumption) to encourage factories to use electricity at night. This will reduce peak loads and increase electricity sales. For this reason, it is necessary to conduct good publicity and explanation work among users so that they also understand the importance of using electricity in a planned way. Fifth, overcome bureaucracy and political paralysis, and further mobilize and organize the masses of workers to prevent sabotage by special agents. Sixth, continue to mobilize the masses of workers and the people in the electricity consumption area to carry out the anti-theft electricity movement, save and use factory self-use electricity economically, and repair lines to reduce various losses. In this way, equipment efficiency can be gradually improved and various losses can be reduced. Therefore, the amount of electricity generated nationwide can be increased by more than one and a half times the planned output in 1950, even without adding new equipment.

    Facts have proved that the above methods can be implemented. At present, individual power plants in some areas have achieved good results. For example, the power supply capacity of the No. 3 boiler in Tianjin No. 1 Plant used to be 5,000 kilowatts. After maintenance, it can now supply 10,000 kilowatts, which fully reaches the original equipment capacity. In the past, the maximum output of Qingdao Power Plant's equipment was less than half of the equipment capacity. After a long period of planned maintenance, it has now reached 100% of the original equipment capacity. Xiaofengman Power Plant has mobilized all employees to ensure uninterrupted power supply for one minute, and has established various safe operation systems in management and operation, achieving a new record of continuous power generation for 160 days without accidents. Fushun Power Plant has implemented a standby fee system based on the highest load, which has increased the load factor and increased electricity sales.

### 充分利用发电设备减少浪费  全国发电量可增一倍半  中央燃料部提出六项改进办法

　　充分利用发电设备减少浪费
    全国发电量可增一倍半
    中央燃料部提出六项改进办法
    【新华社十六日讯】目前全国电业中尚存在着若干不合理与浪费现象，如能加以克服，则全国发电量即可提高一倍半以上。据中央人民政府燃料工业部统计：目前各地工业用电均感缺乏，而全国发电厂的设备及所发电度均未完全利用。据东北电业管理局初步调查结果，仅该局所属各发电厂中即有完好的发电机四万五千千瓦以上未加使用。这些设备容量，几乎等于华北最大的石景山发电厂。估计散在全国各地发电厂及公营企业、工厂、矿山中的多余发电设备，完整的、或稍加检修即可使用的，一定还很多。
    不仅如此，即目前已使用的发电设备亦没有充分利用。这表现在：电业干部的保守思想与供电管理不善，致使发电设备未得充分利用。
    一、设备出力低于原设备容量：去年东北、华北、华东三地的发电厂因解放较早，职工觉悟高，检修成绩较好，但设备的全年平均最大出力亦仅占原设备容量的百分之六五·一。今年计划提高到百分之七八·八，但仍有百分之二一·二的设备效能没有发挥。设备出力之所以不能迅速提高，由于在有些电业工作干部中尚存在着保守思想与不正确的技术观点。他们强调机器陈旧，只是消极地等待新机器，不积极从检修上去改进，并提高设备出力。他们也有安全发电观点，但只认为发电少即比较安全，而不是从有计划的检修上去同时保证提高出力与安全发电。此外，在有些干部中还存在着资本主义的经济观点，认为出力提高到原设备容量并不经济，应停留在某一经济出力点上；而不知如果能供给更多的工厂以生产动力，发展了其他各种工业生产，对整个国家社会来说是更经济的。
  目前设备利用率距可以达到的合理水平很远，各种损耗仍然极大。
    二、设备利用率很低：这是目前很严重的问题。以时间计算，去年华北区各发电厂的平均利用率在全国是最高的，但亦只占全年时间的百分之二八·四。今年全国各发电厂设备平均利用率计划要提高到百分之二九·七，但仍然距离可以达到的合理水准很远。与苏联标准相比，只及百分之四十左右。如果能把利用率提高到应有的标准，则仅以东北、华北、华东三地公营发电厂合计，其增产电度即可超过今年计划发电量的一·三倍，亦等于新建了一个几十万千瓦的发电厂。去年所以不能充分利用设备的原因是事故多，但更主要的问题是供电管理不善。过去各地电业管理局对于用电缺乏严格的计划管理，以致每天二十四小时的负荷不平均，各户用电集中在几小时内，形成尖头负荷很高、平均负荷很低与卖电量很少的现象。
    三、各种损耗仍然很大：去年东北、华北两地发生事故三千六百六十八次，其中东北占二千一百二十四次，计损失电力一千一百万度以上。如用以开采煤矿，可得燃煤四十七万余吨，足够全东北火力发电厂半年之用。今年事故仍不断发生。石景山发电厂六号机发生爆炸修好后，再度发现机器被破坏时，而该厂有些干部尚不立刻进行防卫与检查工作，政治上十分麻痹。此外在个别地区，自用电与线路损失还很严重，有的地区自用电与线路损失竟超过发电量百分之五十以上。
    加强职工责任心，改善管理，定期检修，个别发电厂达到原有设备容量的百分之百。
    据中央燃料工业部研究结果，克服上述种种不合理现象的办法是：第一、加强爱护与关心国家人民财产的责任心，进行发电设备的全面调查，将多余设备呈报中央，以便统一调配合理使用。第二、打破技术上的保守思想与不正确的安全发电观点，确认只有进行有计划的定期检修，才能提高设备效能，保证安全发电。第三、要建立有计划的定期检修制度与运转、维护、管理等方面的专责制度，以便从彻底检修中提高设备效能，并保证不出事故。第四、建立严格的供电管理制度，各地电业管理局应与当地用户订立用电合同，调整各户用电量与用电时间，并实行收取准备费制度（即用户超额用电时累进收费），鼓励工厂深夜用电，这样便能压低尖头负荷，增加卖电量。为此必须在用户之间进行很好的宣传解释工作，使他们也了解有计划地用电的重要性。第五、克服官僚主义与政治上的麻痹现象，进一步动员与组织职工群众防止特务破坏。第六、继续动员职工群众与用电区人民进行反窃电运动，节省与经济使用厂内自用电及整修线路，以减少各种损耗。这样便能逐渐提高设备效能，减少各种损失。因而全国范围内的发电量，即在不增加新设备的条件下，亦可比一九五○年计划产量增加一倍半以上。
    事实证明以上办法是可以实行的，目前个别地区发电厂已获得很好的成绩。如天津一厂三号锅炉过去的供电能力为五千千瓦，经检修后，现已能供给到一万千瓦，完全达到了原有的设备容量。青岛发电厂设备过去最大出力不到设备容量的一半，经长期有计划的检修后，现在已达到原有设备容量的百分之百。小丰满发电厂由于动员了全体职工来保证一分钟不停电，同时在管理上、操作上订出各种安全运转制度，达到连续发电一六○天不出事故的新纪录。抚顺发电厂实行了依照最高负荷收取准备费制度，已使负荷率提高，卖电量增加。
