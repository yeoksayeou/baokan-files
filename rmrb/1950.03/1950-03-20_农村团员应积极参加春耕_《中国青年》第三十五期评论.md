Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League's official publication, "China Youth," issue 35, published a commentary titled "Rural Communist Youth League Members Should Actively Participate in Spring Plowing." The text is as follows:

　　In last year's agricultural production work, the general rural Communist Youth League members played a very large and active role. According to a survey of 925 villages by the Chahar Province Chanan League Committee, 5,254 League members participated in labor allocation groups, planted 262,748 trees, collected 916,940 jin of fertilizer, and selected 178,484 jin of seeds. Especially in the absence of animal power, 4,893 League members organized people to pull plows for harrowing, achieving 95% of autumn harrowing (the original plan was 80%).

　　Spring plowing is approaching, which is the beginning of this year's agricultural production. Rural League branches should, under the leadership of the Party Committee and the higher-level League Committee, conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization within and outside the League. They should more systematically and organizationally promote their active role in production, uniting the broad masses of youth and adults to fully invest in the spring plowing movement. This is currently the central task of the rural League.

　　Old Liberated Area rural League branches should summarize the achievements and experiences of winter production and, based on the unified village spring plowing plan, formulate practical plans for the League's involvement in spring plowing. League members must first overcome the lax thinking that they have already prepared for spring plowing in winter production and can wait until spring plowing begins to take action. They should actively mobilize young men and women to participate in spring plowing, and children should also take on tasks such as leading cattle, making mud bricks, and picking vegetables.

　　Improving farming techniques is an important part of increasing yields. Therefore, League branches should organize young people to study agricultural techniques and humbly learn production experience from labor heroes and model workers. However, they must also give play to the spirit of youth in accepting new things, promote new farming methods such as intensive cultivation, seed selection and soaking, and good farming methods, and set an example with practical actions to break the conservative ideas of ordinary farmers and improve agricultural technology.

　　Communist Youth League members should actively participate in mutual aid and labor exchange, organize manure collection and fertilizer accumulation, exchange seeds, and repair agricultural tools. They should play a backbone role in cultivating land on behalf of military dependents and the families of revolutionary martyrs who lack labor, and influence young people and adults to work together. In general, it is not appropriate to organize young people to work separately. Existing youth mutual aid organizations should be helped and improved according to the actual situation, rather than simply being ordered to disband.

　　For delinquent youth, we must patiently educate and reform them and absorb them into mutual aid. Last year, the Luan County Communist Youth League reformed more than 40 delinquent youths. It is incorrect and detrimental to production to consider them backward, fail to educate them, or even exclude them.

　　We should try our best to persist in learning during spring plowing, maintaining and developing the achievements learned in various studies. Under the principle of not hindering production, with League members as the backbone, we should lead the broad masses of youth to maintain evening schools, noon schools, or establish study groups based on mutual aid teams, studying in the gaps between labor.

　　In disaster areas, the League should actively publicize the policy of self-reliance through production. First of all, it is necessary to persuade families to overcome the idea of ​​waiting for and relying on the government to borrow seeds and fertilizers, and to participate in mutual aid and mutual relief through their own active actions, and rush to plant early-maturing crops such as spring wheat, barley, peas, and various vegetables. League branches should call on young people inside and outside the League to participate in repairing rivers and ditches to overcome the spring famine by providing work as a form of relief; transform out-of-season sideline production into timely and agriculture-related sideline production, and develop sideline industries according to local conditions. It is necessary to recognize that the fundamental way to overcome disasters is agricultural production.

　　In the new areas, some of the masses are not clear about the production policy and have fears of eating from a "common pot," so they dare not work boldly. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on educating young people to break their worries and recognize that organizing production on the basis of voluntariness and mutual benefit is stronger than working alone. Organizing can overcome the difficulties of insufficient human and animal power, and can produce more grain. It is necessary to mobilize young people to actively participate in the spring plowing movement, and pay attention to absorbing activists to establish the Communist Youth League during the movement.

　　农村团员应积极参加春耕
    ——《中国青年》第三十五期评论
    【新华社十九日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关刊物《中国青年》第三十五期发表题为“农村团员应积极参加春耕”的评论。文如下：
    在去年农业生产工作中，一般的农村团员，起了很大的积极的作用。根据察哈尔省察南团地委九百二十五个村调查，就有团员五千二百五十四人参加拨工组，植树二十六万二千七百四十八棵，压肥九十一万六千九百四十斤，选种十七万八千四百八十四斤，特别是在无畜力的情况下，有团员四千八百九十三人组织人拉犁进行刹地，使秋刹地达到百分之九十五（原计划刹地百分之八十）。
    目前即将春耕，这是今年农业生产的开端，农村团应在党委和在上级团委领导下，在团内外进行广泛深入的宣传动员，要更有计划地有组织地发扬在生产中的积极作用，团结广大青年与成年人一道，全力投入春耕运动中去。这是目前农村团的中心任务。
    老区农村团应总结冬季生产成绩与经验，并根据全村统一的春耕计划，制定出切合实际的团在春耕中的计划。团员要首先克服认为在冬季生产中对春耕已作了准备，到春耕开始再动手的懈怠思想。应该积极动员男女青年群众参加春耕，儿童也应把牵牛打泥块拾菜等工作担负起来。
    提高耕作技术是增加产量的重要一环，因此团支部要组织青年研究农业技术，虚心向劳动英雄、生产模范学习生产经验。但是，又必须发挥青年接受新事物的精神，提倡新的农作法，如精耕细作，选种浸种，以及好的农作方法，并以实际行动作出榜样，打破一般农民的保守观念，以提高农业技术。
    青年团员要积极参加互助变工，组织送粪积肥，调换籽种，修理农具，在给无劳动力或缺劳力的军工烈属代耕中，起骨干作用，并影响青年与成年，一道进行。一般情况下组织青年单独搞一套是不妥当的。对已有的青年变工组织，应根据实际情况，予以帮助和改进，而不是简单的下命令解散。
    对于二流子青年，要耐心教育改造，并吸收他们参加互助。去年滦县青年团改造了四十多个二流子。如认为他们落后，不加以教育，甚至排斥，那是不正确的作法，是对生产不利的。
    在春耕中应尽量坚持学习，保持并发展在各种学习中所学得的成果。在不妨碍生产的原则下，以团员为骨干，带动广大青年，保持上夜校、午校，或以互助组为单位建立学习小组，在劳动空隙中学习。
    灾区的团，应积极宣传生产自救政策，首先要说服家庭克服等待和依靠政府借种籽肥料的思想，以自己的积极行动参加互助互济，赶种早熟农作物，如春麦、大麦、豌豆及各种蔬菜。团支部要号召团内外青年参加修浚河道，以工代赈克服春荒；把不合季节的副业生产转为适时的与农业有关的副业生产上去，要因地制宜发展副业，要认清战胜灾荒的根本办法是农业生产。
    在新区，部分群众对生产政策不清楚，存在怕吃大锅饭的思想，不敢大胆劳动，因此要着重教育青年打破顾虑，认识在自愿两利基础上组织起来生产，比单独干强，组织起来就可以克服人畜力不足的困难，并可以多打粮食。要发动青年积极参加春耕运动，在运动中注意吸收积极分子建立青年团。
