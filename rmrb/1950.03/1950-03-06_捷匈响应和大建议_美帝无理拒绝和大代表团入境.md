    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: TASS reported: The Czechoslovak National Assembly discussed the suggestion by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, calling on national parliaments to strengthen the defense of peace, in late February. Prior to the discussion, the Vice-Chairman of the National Assembly, Mrs. Hodinová, reported that the National Assembly had received 5,088 peace resolutions sent from people's organizations, factories, and villages across the country.
    The National Assembly passed a resolution supporting the pronouncement of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The National Assembly also requested: the cessation of imperialist arms expansion, condemnation of instigators of new wars, prohibition of atomic weapons, cessation of colonial wars in Vietnam and Malaya, cessation of the restoration of fascism in West Germany and the policy of restoring West Germany as a military base in Central Europe, and the conclusion of a Great Power Pact. The National Assembly requested the United Nations to implement these principles in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter.
    The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic also convened a meeting in late February to discuss the pronouncement of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The Hungarian Council of Ministers, headed by Dobi, the delegation of the National Committee of the Hungarian Peace Movement, headed by Iopolu, and the delegation of the National Assembly, headed by Drahos, all participated in the meeting. The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, on behalf of all working people and the National Assembly of Hungary, guaranteed its support for the proposals in the pronouncement of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: TASS, New York: While progressive American writers, artists, and educators were actively preparing to welcome the World Peace Delegation, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 3rd, unreasonably refusing to issue entry visas to the delegation.

    Note: The World Peace Delegation, which was preparing to go to the United States, is one of the delegations sent by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to various countries. The purpose of the delegation's visit to the United States was to present proposals to the U.S. Congress regarding the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The delegation included the Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, the famous French painter Picasso, and the British university professor Aubel, among others.
