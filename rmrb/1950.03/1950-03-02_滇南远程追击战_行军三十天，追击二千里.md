　　Long-Distance Pursuit Battle in Southern Yunnan
    Marching for Thirty Days, Pursuing for Two Thousand Li
    A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entering Yunnan, in coordination with fraternal units, completely annihilated the bandit 8th Army and 26th Army in a pursuit of more than two thousand li in thirty days. This unit departed from Baise County, Guangxi, on January 6th, beginning a continuous forced march of more than one hundred and twenty li per day. When they arrived at Ameng Street in Guangnan County town on the 12th, they received news that Hekou, an important border town in southern Yunnan, had been liberated by a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army and local people's armed forces, and that the enemy, having their escape route cut off, wanted to escape from Mengzi by plane. Everyone was extremely anxious, fearing that the enemy would escape. They slept for less than four hours that night, and continued to advance in the middle of the night, planning to travel two hundred and forty li in one day. They left behind heavy artillery, heavy machine guns, and bulky objects, and launched a lightly armed assault, bypassing the enemy's outposts and directly penetrating the enemy's heart. On the 15th, they captured Mengzi County town and the airport. Some of the enemy's planes at the airport took off in a hurry, some were shot down as soon as they took off, and some were captured by our army before they could escape. The bandit army did not expect the Liberation Army to arrive so quickly. From Baise to Mengzi there were fifteen stations, each station at least ninety li. They estimated that the Liberation Army would not arrive until at least ten days later. However, the swift action of this steel pursuit force captured this group of remnants in nine days and nine nights. Some of the bandit 26th Army were gathering for a meeting, and some were eating, and they were captured in such a confused manner. The scattered bandit troops around them, because they lost contact, also surrendered to the People's Liberation Army one after another. The bandit 8th Army, which was preparing to escape to Hainan Island by plane, saw that the situation was unfavorable, turned around and ran, trying to cross the Yuan River to Simao to escape by plane. "See where you can escape!" The Liberation Army immediately launched another four-hundred-li raid. Gejiu, Jianshui, Shiping and other places were successively liberated. The soldiers marched day and night, chasing after them. They had not slept for seven days. At first, the soldiers were still calculating the distance by one hundred and thirty, one hundred and sixty, and two hundred and forty li, but later they simply stopped counting and chased desperately. After climbing Huangmao Ridge, which could not be reached even after a whole night, some soldiers were so hungry and exhausted that they fell asleep on the side of the road. When the people behind woke them up, they quickly caught up with the team. Everyone encouraged each other, and finally annihilated the enemy in front of the iron chain bridge of the Yuan River on January 24. They captured the bandit army's Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Yao and many other high-ranking bandit officers. Only more than two thousand people from the bandit 8th Army escaped across the Yuan River. The commanders and fighters vowed not to leave any future troubles, and continued to pursue in coordination with the local armed forces, crossing mountains, passing through malaria-infested areas, chasing through Mojiang City, and all the way to the territory of Zhenyuan County. On February 6, the escaped remnants obediently surrendered. By this time, the remaining bandits in Yunnan had been completely wiped out.

　　滇南远程追击战
    行军三十天，追击二千里
    进入云南的人民解放军某部，配合兄弟部队，在三十天内追击两千多里，将匪第八军与二十六军彻底歼灭。这支部队于一月六日由广西百色县出发，开始了每天一百二十里以上的连续急行军。当他们十二日到达广南县城的阿猛街时，得到滇南边境要地河口已为第四野战军某部和当地人民武装解放，敌人因逃路已断，想从蒙自坐飞机逃走的消息。大家急得直跳，唯恐让敌人逃走了。当夜睡了不到四个钟头，半夜里就继续前进，预定在一天内赶二百四十里路。不带大炮，重机枪和笨重物件都留在后面，轻装突击，绕过敌人的前哨部队一直插入敌人的心脏。十五日就打下了蒙自县城和飞机场。飞机场中敌人的飞机，有的慌忙起飞，有的刚一起飞就被击落，有的来不及飞逃就被我军缴获。匪军根本没有料到解放军来得这样快，由百色到蒙自是十五个驿站，每站至少九十华里，他们估计解放军至少要十天以后才来得了。可是这支钢铁追击部队神速的行动，九日九夜就将这批残匪抓住了。匪二十六军有的集合在开会，有的在吃饭，就这样糊里糊涂地当了俘虏。周围的零星匪军因为失去联络，也陆陆续续向人民解放军投降。准备坐飞机逃往海南岛的匪第八军，见势头不妙，扭头就跑，想窜过元江到思茅坐飞机逃走。“看你往那里逃！”解放军紧接着又来个四百里的奔袭战。个旧、建水、石屏等地陆续解放，战士们不分昼夜，兼程追击，七天没有睡觉。起初战士们还一百三、一百六、二百四地计算着里数，后来干脆就不计了，拼命地追击。爬过一夜还上不到顶的黄毛岭后，有的战士实在是饥饿疲劳不堪，倒在路旁鼾然睡去，等后来的人叫醒了他时，他又迅速地赶上队伍。大家互相鼓励，终于一月二十四日在元江的铁索桥跟前把敌人消灭了。俘虏了匪陆军副总司令汤尧和其他匪高级军官多人。匪第八军只有两千多人逃过元江。指战员们发誓不要留后患，又配合地方武装继续追赶，翻越大山，穿过瘴疗区，追过墨江城，一直追到镇沅县境，二月六日，漏网的残匪乖乖地投降了。云南成股残匪至此已全部就歼。
