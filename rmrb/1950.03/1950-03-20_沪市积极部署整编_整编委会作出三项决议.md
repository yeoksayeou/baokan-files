Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 17th: The Shanghai Municipal Establishment Committee was established on the 10th and is now actively deploying reorganization in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work. Li Yu is the director of the committee, and Zhou Lin and Zhang Chengzong are the deputy directors. The committee held two meetings on the 10th and 13th, making three resolutions: (1) Establish an ideological foundation: All units are required to thoroughly study the relevant instructions and documents on establishment, grasp the basic spirit of streamlining institutions, improving work efficiency, and saving financial expenditures. (2) Clarify the establishment policy: The establishment should be combined with the transformation of institutions, the rectification of ideology, the needs of work and development, and the rational allocation of personnel. (3) Pre-determined steps: The first step is to establish organizations and collect materials. Branches should be established in major units, and groups can be established in each unit. All units must submit accurate statistics of the existing number of personnel, positions, vehicles, and existing organizational system charts to the Municipal Establishment Committee on March 17th and 18th. The second step is to determine staffing levels, determine establishments, carry out reorganization, and check for unreasonable phenomena such as overlapping institutions, redundant personnel, unscientific division of labor, mutual restraint, uneven workload, and disconnection between higher and lower levels. The heads must be responsible for absorbing personnel from various departments and offices and party branches to participate, promote democratic discussion, and propose new establishment plans based on current work, combined with development needs, and in accordance with the spirit of establishment. Before the establishment is determined, any increase or decrease in personnel must be suspended. If necessary, the reasons must be clearly stated and approved by the Municipal Establishment Committee before any increase or decrease can be made; strictly prohibit arbitrary additions or reductions. Redundant personnel will be concentrated for training and await unified allocation. Currently, the main focus is on studying new and reasonable institutional issues. For retained personnel, the policy of taking them all in and transforming and rationally using them step by step will be resolutely implemented.
