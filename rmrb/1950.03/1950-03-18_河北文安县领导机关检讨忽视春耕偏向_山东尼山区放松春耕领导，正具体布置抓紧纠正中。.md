　　【Our Newspaper News】The Wen'an County Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province conducted a work inspection at the end of February and discovered that the county-level leading organs had a tendency to only pay attention to sideline production and relax leadership in agricultural production, which affected the development of spring plowing work in the county. Wen'an County has low-lying terrain, and perennial water accumulation covers one-third of the area. Therefore, floods are the biggest obstacle to the local people's production. Last year's flood was severe. At that time, the county-level leading organs promptly grasped the leadership of the masses in production and self-salvation, and launched a variety of handicraft production based on different regions and different situations. According to statistics in early January, several major sideline productions organized more than 50,100 people, and the remaining disaster victims also engaged in various sideline productions. Except for more than 10,000 disaster victims who still have no appropriate way to overcome the famine, most of the disaster victims have a guarantee to overcome the famine. Now the distribution of disaster relief grain and loan grain has also been largely completed. However, after this inspection, it was found that the county leading organs have a tendency to relax leadership in agricultural production. In the spring production, in addition to specific instructions on planting spring wheat, organizing forces to rush planting, and inspection, the county only generally arranged other spring plowing preparations, and did not promptly carry out inspection and supervision. The county is expected to build more than 40,000 rice paddies, a large number and a tight schedule, so that only 50,000 catties of rice seeds have been prepared so far. The county supply and marketing cooperative is expected to prepare 1,000 catties of garlic seeds, which has just begun, and other early-maturing seeds have also just begun to be prepared. The leadership of agricultural production in various districts and villages is also extremely inattentive. The Fifth District could originally plant 7,500 mu of barley, but only 2,000 mu were planted by February 26. Lu Zhuangzi in the district could have planted 50 mu of barley, but because the leadership was not grasped tightly, the land is now back-slurry (the ground has thawed) and cannot be sown. Now many people in the eastern part of the First District are automatically weeding wheat. After the county-level leading organs discovered this serious situation through work inspection, the county government has instructed various districts to take different remedial measures according to different situations. At the same time, the county's main cadres have personally gone to the countryside to inspect and lead the masses in spring plowing.

    【Our Newspaper News】According to the Dazhong Daily, although all parts of the Ni District of Shandong have generally begun harrowing the land and some have begun plowing, many counties and districts have relaxed their thinking on leading spring plowing, which has affected the progress of spring plowing. Various counties are studying how to overcome shortcomings. Since the deployment of spring plowing production, the counties have generally carried out publicity, but the importance and mastery are not universal enough, so the progress of spring plowing is extremely uneven, and the progress of most counties and districts is very slow. The main reasons are:
    1. The counties and districts with more autumn plowing last year have a sense of complacency, thinking that spring plowing is not as important as disaster relief. For example, in Ziyang County, because 90% of the land was plowed in winter last year, and the masses have now begun harrowing the land, the leadership believes that there is no problem with spring plowing. The Gangshan District Party Committee Secretary said: "Our district has plowed 60% of the land in winter, and the remaining part can be completed anyway." Many district party committee secretaries in Zou County, Qufu and other counties said: "Spring plowing is not as difficult as disaster relief," so they separated disaster relief from spring plowing, and focused on the disaster relief side. 2. Production education for all strata is not yet sufficient, so some rich peasants are afraid of land reform and are still waiting to be dealt with, some middle peasants have concerns about production, and some poor peasants are still waiting to be distributed land. 3. Households with cattle still have concerns, saying "they can't be busy." Therefore, most of the current joint plowing is only in villages where the cattle protection policy is well implemented.
    Because there are still the above problems in spring plowing, the promotion of spring plowing work in these counties is extremely slow. The local CCP District Committee has instructed the county committees to quickly discuss and grasp the leadership of spring plowing.

　　河北文安县领导机关检讨忽视春耕偏向
    山东尼山区放松春耕领导，正具体布置抓紧纠正中。
    【本报讯】河北省文安县县政府、中共县委会在二月底进行工作检查，发现县级领导机关存在只注意副业生产，放松农业生产领导的偏向，以致影响全县春耕工作的开展。文安县由于地势低下，常年积水面积达三分之一。因此水灾是当地群众生产上最大障碍。去年水灾严重，当时县级领导机关及时抓紧领导群众生产自救，并根据不同地区不同情况，发动了多种多样手工业生产。据一月初统计：几种主要副业生产，即组织起群众五万一百余人，其余灾民也进行各种副业生产。全县除有万余灾民尚无适当办法渡荒外，绝大部分灾民已有了渡过灾荒的保证。现在赈粮贷粮亦已大体发完。但经过这次检查，发现县领导机关存在放松农业生产领导的偏向。在春季生产中，县里除对种春麦作了具体指示、组织力量突击抢种与检查外，对其他春耕准备只一般地布置了，未及时进行检查督促。全县预计打稻池子四万余个，数目大而时间紧迫，致至今才准备好五万斤稻种。县供销社预计准备一千斤蒜籽，现在才开始进行，其他早熟种籽也刚开始准备。各区村对农业生产的领导也极不注意。五区本来能种七千五百亩大麦，但至二月二十六日才种上二千亩。该区鲁庄子本可种五十亩大麦，因未抓紧领导，现地里反浆（地开冻了）已不能播种。现在一区东部不少群众正自动进行锄麦。县级领导机关经过检查工作发现这一严重情况后，县府已指示各区，根据不同情况采取不同补救办法。同时县级主要干部已亲自下乡检查、领导群众春耕。（中共文安县委会刘光、李泽民、李顺亭、张文祺）
    【本报讯】据大众日报消息：山东尼山区各地虽已普遍开始耙地，部分开始耕地，但不少县区对领导春耕思想松懈，影响了春耕的进展。各县正在研究克服缺点。该区自布置春耕生产后，各县一般均进行了宣传，但在重视与掌握上还不够普遍，因此春耕进度极不平衡，大部县区进度很慢。主要原因是：
    一、去秋冬耕多的县区，存在麻痹思想，认为春耕不如救灾要紧。如滋阳县因去年已冬耕百分之九十，群众现已开始耙地，领导上就认为春耕已无问题。岗山区分委书记说：“咱区已冬耕百分之六十，剩下的这一点怎么着也能完成了。”邹县、曲阜等县不少分区委书记说：“春耕没救灾那么难”，因此将救灾与春耕割裂开来看，偏重了救灾的一面。二、对各阶层的生产教育还做得不够，因此有的富农害怕土改，还在等着处理，有的中农生产存在着顾虑，有的贫农还在等着分地。三、有牛户还存有顾虑，说“忙不了”。因此现在上犋的多半只是护牛政策贯彻好的村。
    由于在春耕中还存在以上问题，致这些县份对春耕工作推动极为缓慢。当地中共地委已指示各县委迅速讨论抓紧对春耕的领导。
