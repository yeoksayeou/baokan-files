[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its fourth plenary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th. The meeting accepted all the resolutions of the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference and instructed the Municipal Government General Office to forward each case to the relevant departments. These departments are to draft specific implementation plans and schedules, which the Municipal Government will then supervise and inspect on time. All resolutions from the first and second sessions of the first People's Representatives Conference should also be re-examined for their implementation status. Those recently implemented must be reported in writing on a case-by-case basis, and those not yet implemented should be continued and completed within a specified timeframe. The meeting heard and discussed Vice Mayor Wu Han's work report on the inspection committee of the Health Bureau, and Secretary-General Xue Zizheng's summary report on the Second Session of the Second People's Representatives Conference. The meeting exchanged views on the re-division of administrative districts in Beijing's urban and suburban areas, as well as the draft regulations for the organization of district people's representative conferences, and approved the list of personnel appointments for three newly established Beijing institutions: 1. Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, 2. Beijing Municipal People's Supervision Committee, 3. Beijing Municipal Enterprise Corporation. After the meeting, committee members personally inspected the drainage and river works in the moats of the former three city gates, Longxu Ditch, Jin River, and Chang River, both inside and outside the city.
