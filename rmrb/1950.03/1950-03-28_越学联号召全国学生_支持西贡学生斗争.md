　　Vietnamese Students' Federation Calls on Students Nationwide
    Support Saigon Students' Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 26th] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, March 26th: Nguyen Thuong, Chairman of the Vietnamese Students' Federation, sent a telegram to Saigon students on March 22nd, expressing full support for their struggle against American interference in Indochina, and calling on students across Vietnam to fully support this struggle.
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 25th] TASS, London, March 25th: The weekly "New Statesman and Nation" commented on the demonstrations held by Saigon students in Vietnam to protest the arrival of American warships in Saigon waters, stating: "Today, American policy in Asia is so unpopular that the arrival of their fleets or military supplies can no longer be welcomed anywhere in East Asia." The journal continued: "American support for Bao Dai is a desperate struggle to seize Cochinchina, which America now sees as the only possible land and naval base on the Asian continent. For the past four years, the Vietnamese resistance war has defeated the attempt by 150,000 French troops to reoccupy Vietnam. American support for Bao Dai will be like its support for Chiang Kai-shek, it will increase the determination of the Vietnamese people to fight for their national independence."

　　越学联号召全国学生
    支持西贡学生斗争
    【新华社二十七日讯】越南通讯社北越二十六日讯：越南学生联合会主席阮常于三月二十二日致电西贡学生，对他们反对美国干涉印度支那的斗争表示充分支持，并号召越南全国学生全力支持这一斗争。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日讯：《新政治家与民族》周刊评论越南西贡学生为抗议美舰开抵西贡海面而举行的示威称：今天美国对亚洲的政策，是如此地不得人心，他们的舰队或军事供应品的到达，再也难以受到东亚任何地方的欢迎。该刊继称：美国支持保大，是为了攫取交趾支那而作的绝望挣扎，美国现在把交趾支那看作是亚洲大陆上唯一而可能的一个陆海军基地。过去四年来，越南的抗战击败了十五万法军重占越南的企图。美国支持保大将和支持蒋介石一样，它将增加越南人民为其国家独立而斗争的决心。
