　　Shanghai Era Press Published "Sagan's Spring"
　　Ling Yin
　　Some time ago, I saw a translated novel called "Sagan's Spring," a famous Soviet work, translated by Wang Zhonghuan and published by Shanghai Era Press. I read it alongside the English and French translations, originally intending to learn something by comparing them, but unexpectedly discovered many errors in it. I believe that translation should be faithful to the original author and responsible to the readers, so I am pointing out some of the errors in this book for everyone's reference, and I sincerely hope that the translator and publisher will be vigilant and make corrections.
　　In my comparison, I found that the translation is entirely based on the English translation, so I will use the English translation as the basis for my comments.

　　(1) Page 1 of the translation: "And Mount Klitye is a treacherous mountain range that harbors avalanches..." This statement is really puzzling. What does this mountain range harbor that is "born of avalanches"? In fact, the original text is like this:
　　"Mount Klitye, a cunning mountain range that always hides some collapsing snow blocks..."

　　(2) Page 4 of the translation: "At the end of the 1890s, Sagan was only then listed in the national official documents as a rural residence." The meaning seems to be that Sagan had already been registered in the national "official documents" (what are "official documents"?), but in the wrong column, and was later listed as a "rural residence." But the original text is:
　　"It was not until the end of the 1890s that Sagan was included in the official table of rural residences."

　　(3) Page 5 of the translation: "Other villages, many people have written standard descriptions for them..." What are "standard descriptions"? But the original text is simply:
　　"Those villages, many others have written articles to praise them..."

　　(4) Page 6 of the translation: "I returned to Sagan once in 1933, at that time I decided I would become a painter." What is "decided I would"? Such wording is truly distressing, but the original text is not difficult, just a simple sentence: "Almost became a painter."

　　(5) Page 9 of the translation: "On Kisha's side, he expressed deep dissatisfaction with the various methods handled by the rural Soviet, clearly indicating that he was unwilling to conceal his ambition." The meaning of this sentence in the original text is: "On Keiso's (i.e., Kisha's) side, he did not approve of the village Soviet's methods of managing affairs, and clearly did not want to conceal this fact." The translator not only made a mistake but also arbitrarily added "ambition," causing readers to have a bad misunderstanding of Keiso's character.

　　(6) Page 26 of the translation: "He turned his body informally..." But the original text is: "People turned him around informally..." Subject and object are reversed, completely mistaken.

　　(7) Page 37 of the translation: "Listening to everything with the discerning eyes of a farmer." It is strange to listen to everything with your eyes. In fact, the original text is: "Seeing everything with the sharp eyes of a farmer."

　　(8) Page 38 of the translation: "A good farmer cannot only raise a dog and not care about a cow." This aphorism probably means that a good farmer cannot only raise a dog and not raise a cow; if you want to raise a dog, you should raise a cow even more, right? But this is a "proverb" fabricated by the translator. The original text is very ordinary:
　　"A good farmer wouldn't even keep a dog there, let alone a cow!"

　　(9) Page 41: "He doesn't think of any way for this family." The original text is: "He doesn't care about this house, or anything else..."

　　(10) Page 46: "You must remember that a melancholy Sagan person encountering sunny weather is a rare phenomenon." So a melancholy Sagan person only encounters rain all year round? How strange! The original text is like this:
　　"It is a very rare phenomenon for a melancholy Sagan person to appear on a sunny day."

　　(11) Page 59: "This is not Rashid's lack of affection for relatives." So Rashid has a lot of affection for relatives! In fact, it's the opposite. It should be translated as:
　　"In any case, Rashid did not have the weakness of familial affection."

　　(12) Page 67: "This girl twisted her sleeping body, and then made a snoring sound on the pillow, and after a while, opened her eyes." The translator probably thought that people must snore when they sleep, so this girl must snore when she sleeps. In fact, the original text is:
　　"The girl turned to the side and rubbed her nose in the pillow for a while before opening her eyes."

　　(13) Page 97: "Kisha spent all his time on the playing field, from early morning until night." It seems like he is a person who only knows how to play and spends all his time on the playing field. But the original text is:
　　"Keiso spent all his time in the fields, from morning to night."

　　(14) Page 105: "He drank the goat's milk angrily; he cursed himself." Drinking and cursing at the same time, how lively! But the original text is:
　　"He angrily gulped down the goat's milk and scalded himself."

　　The above are just a few obvious examples that I picked out at random. The errors in the entire book are countless. For example, "containing profound meaning" is translated as "contempt" (page 13). "Formal lumberjack" is translated as "normal lumberjack" (page 44). "Express letter" is translated as "a fiery letter" (page 54), "Isn't this enough?" is translated as "Have you figured it out?" (page 55). "The only person who stayed awake all night" is translated as "A person was so excited during this night." Such examples are too numerous to list. There are twelve errors in the translation of the eleven lines on the first page, which is really serious.

　　In addition, the translator's language is still that of the old intellectuals, divorced from the language of the people. For example, the affectionate nickname for a writer, "the writing man," is translated as "litterateur," which has special class connotations, and "rural residents" is translated as "peasants," which has contemptuous connotations, and so on. It is impossible to convey the thoughts and feelings of the people of socialist countries by translating Soviet literary works in this kind of language. Language issues are an important issue in the translation of literary works, and we should pay more attention to them, but I won't say much about it now.

### 上海时代书局出版的《萨根的春天》

　　上海时代书局出版的《萨根的春天》
    凌茵
    前些日子，看到一本唤作《萨根的春天》的翻译小说，是苏联的一部名著，译者是王仲桓，由上海时代书局出版。我对着英译本和法译本读了一下，原意是想对照着学习一些东西，不料却在里面发现了许多错误。我觉得翻译应该忠实于原作者，应该对读者负责，所以把这书的错误指出一些来，供大家参考，并且深望那位译者及出版者有所警惕和改正。
    在对照中我发现译文完全是根据英译，所以现在亦以英译为根据来说。
    （一）译文第一页：“而克立其山又是蕴藏了雪崩时生的一座阴险的山岭，……”这话实在费解。这座山蕴藏了雪崩时生的什么呢？其实原文是这样的：
    “克立其山，一座老是隐藏着一些崩落的雪块的狡滑的山岭，……”
    （二）译文第四页：“在上世纪九十年代之末，萨根方才在国家的公文书中，列入为农村居地。”意思仿佛是萨根早已登记在国家的《公文书》中（什么叫《公文书》呀？），不过登错了栏，后来才列入《农村居地》。而原文则是：
    “直到九十年代末，萨根才被计入官方的农村居地表内。”
    （三）译文第五页：“其他的乡村，已有很多人为他们标准写述……”，什么“标准写述”呀？但原文不过是：
    “那些乡村，有许多别人写文章来表扬它们……”。
    （四）译文第六页：“我在一九三三年间回到过萨根一次，当时我决将成为一个画家。”什么是“决将”呢？这样的文字真叫你苦恼，但是原文却不艰深的，不过是：“差点儿成一个画家了”这样一句简单的话。
    （五）译文第九页：“在基沙这一方面，他对乡苏维埃所处理的各种办法，深表不满，显然地表示他不愿意掩饰他的雄心。”这句原文的意思是：“在克伊索（即基沙）这方面，他不赞成村苏维埃管理事务的方法，并且显然不想把这一事实掩饰起来。”译者弄错不说了，还擅自加上什么“雄心”，使读者对克伊索的性格发生不良的误解。
    （六）译文第二十六页：“他不拘礼节地把身体旋转……”而原文却是：“人们不拘礼节地把他转过身来……”宾主倒置，完全弄错。
    （七）译文第三十七页：“以一个农民精明的眼光静听着一切。”用眼光来听一切，是很奇怪的。其实原文却是：“用一个农民的锐利的眼光看到了一切。”
    （八）译文第三十八页：“一个好农夫不能只养一条狗，而不顾一条牛。”这个警句大约是说一个好农夫不能只养狗不养牛，既要养狗就更应养牛吧？但这是译者杜撰的“谚语”。原文却是很平常的：
    “一个好农夫连狗也不肯养在那儿，不用说一条牛啦！”
    （九）第四十一页：“他对这个家，一点也不想什么办法。”原文却是：“他对这所房子，或别的什么，一点都不介意……”。
    （十）第四十六页：“你须记着一个忧郁的萨根人遇到了晴朗的天气，是一件希有的现象。”那么一个忧郁的萨根人终年只是遇到阴雨了？多奇怪的事呢？原文却是这样的：
    “在晴天有忧郁的萨根人出现，是非常稀有的现象。”
    （十一）第五十九页：“这并不是拉希德对亲戚的情谊淡薄。”那么拉希德对亲戚很有情谊罗！其实弄反啦。应译为：
    “无论如何，拉希德并没有亲族的私情这种弱点。”
    （十二）第六十七页：“这姑娘扭转睡体，又在枕上发出了一阵鼾声，一会儿，把她的眼睛张开来。”大概译者以为人睡了一定要打鼾，所以这位姑娘睡了一定也非打鼾不可。其实原文是：
    “这姑娘侧过身来，又把鼻子埋在枕头里揉擦了一会，才把眼张开。”
    （十三）第九十七页：“基沙在球场上花费了他所有的时间，从清早起一直到夜晚。”好象他是一个只晓得玩，把时间都花费在球场上的人。但原文却是：
    “克伊索把全部时间都花费在田地上，从清晨到夜晚。”
    （十四）第一○五页：“他愠怒地喝着羊奶；他就自己咒骂自己。”一面喝，一面骂，很热闹的啊？不过原文却是：
    “他愤怒地大口喝着羊奶，烫了自己。”
    以上只是随手举出的几个明显的例子。全书的错误是多得不堪，例如：把“含有深意”译成“鄙视”（十三页）。把“正式的伐木工”译成“正常的伐木人”（第四十四页）。把“急信”译成“火热的一封信”（第五十四页），把“这些还不够吗？”译成“是不是你已弄清楚了？”（第五十五页）。把“惟一彻夜不眠的人，”译成“一个人在这夜间这样兴奋。”诸如此类，不胜枚举。第一页共十一行的译文就有十二处的错误，实在是严重得很了。
    此外，译者的文字还是旧知识分子的，脱离人民的文字。例如，把对作家的一个亲昵的绰号“写字的人”译成含有特殊阶级意味的“文人”，把“农村居民”译成含有轻鄙意味的“乡民”等等。用这种文字来翻译苏联文艺作品，是不可能传达出社会主义国家的人民的思想感情的。语言问题是翻译文艺作品上的一个重要问题，值得我们多多注意，但是现在且不多说了。
