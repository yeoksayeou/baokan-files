　　The experience of the Xinping Road Shoemaking Cooperative:
    Using technical workers as the backbone; Implementing democratic management; Establishing a set of business operation systems.
    [Beijing News] The experience of the Xinping Road Shoemaking Production Cooperative, one of the constituent units of the Beijing Shoemaking Cooperative Joint Association, proves that if a production cooperative wants to be run well, it must use technical workers as its backbone, implement democratic management, and establish a complete business operation system. The cooperative was established in June last year, jointly initiated by the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the District Government's District Women's Work Group. Its members were mostly unemployed workers and housewives. The purpose was to solve their own livelihoods and subsidize their families. At that time, there were forty-nine members with sixty-one shares, totaling 305 jin of millet. It also obtained a loan of 4.5 million yuan and ten bolts of white cloth from the Cooperative Bank, and began production in early July. At that time, they lacked business experience and had no production plan. Most of the funds were used to buy furniture, thus reducing production funds. At the same time, most of the members did not understand that they must make their products suitable for general consumers, especially the needs of the working people, in order to promote sales and win the market. They blindly wanted to fight against private merchants, changed the original plan of making Mao Di canvas shoes, and began to make Chongfu呢 Qiancengdi shoes. Due to poor management and insufficient production technology, the cost was high and the product quality was low, making them difficult to sell. In July, they produced eighty pairs of shoes and only sold three; in August, they produced 129 pairs and only sold twenty-nine, and the funds could not be turned over. In addition, the democratic spirit was not implemented in production management, which caused widespread dissatisfaction among the members, and sixteen members withdrew from the cooperative, causing production in September to be in a state of semi-paralysis. In late September, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative discovered these problems and emphasized: "Production must face the masses, and management must promote democracy." It sent cadres to help them adjust the organization, convene member meetings, organize member groups, and elect management personnel for the cooperative. During this stage, a total of forty-five members were developed. In terms of business, due to improved management methods, calculated product costs, took the initiative to take samples to various places to find customers, and solicited opinions on the products, the business developed after October, undertaking more than 13,500 pairs of cotton shoes and leather shoes for units such as Ge Da, the Public Security Bureau, and the Military Supplies Department. During this period, the members were busy making shoes and did not pay attention to scientific division of labor and production management, which resulted in the failure to purchase raw materials in time for the order for five thousand pairs of leather shoes, which was affected by price fluctuations; when purchasing leather, they were deceived by unscrupulous merchants, and more than 10,000 feet of leather were short of more than 1,300 feet; in addition, negligence in warehouse management caused the stock of shoe uppers to be short of 500 pairs. In total, this loss was about 27,000 jin of millet, which seriously hit the business that had just started. After these two lessons, the cooperative reviewed the reasons for the failure and came to several experiences: 1. The establishment of a production cooperative must be based on technical workers; 2. Promote democratic management; 3. Implement scientific management and pay attention to cost accounting; 4. The cadres of the production cooperative must have both production and business knowledge. Therefore, in January of this year, the cooperative reorganized its organization, established various systems such as division of labor and responsibility, labor discipline, accounting, and vouchers. In order to increase production funds and ensure uninterrupted production, they also called on members to invest more shares. Now the cooperative has 145 members, 465 shares, totaling 2,325 jin of millet. Under the leather shoe and cloth shoe system, there are seven production groups, each group selecting a group leader to be responsible for distributing work and inspecting work. After joining the Joint Association in mid-January, the issue of funds and contracting work has become more guaranteed, so now the members' work enthusiasm is very high. Many people get up early and work late to rush to work. Preliminary achievements have also been made in improving technology and saving raw materials. For example, from the previous fifty stitches per square inch of shoe sole, it is now possible to sew seventy stitches; from the previous six pairs of shoes per yard of cloth, it is now possible to make seven pairs. In January, a total of 5,500 pairs of cloth shoes and 1,000 pairs of leather shoes were produced, with a net profit of 7.6 million yuan. The cooperative has now set a production plan for the first half of this year, with an average monthly production of 10,500 pairs of cloth shoes and 2,000 pairs of leather shoes. With a profit of half a jin of millet per pair, the profit for half a year will be 37,500 jin of millet. In addition to making up for last year's losses, a profit of more than 10,000 jin of millet can still be obtained.

　　新平路制鞋合作社的经验：
    以技术工人做骨干；实行民主管理；建立一套业务经营制度。
    【北京讯】北京市制鞋合作社联合社的组成单位之一——新平路制鞋生产合作社的经验证明：一个生产合作社要想办好，必须以技术工人为骨干，实行民主管理，建立完整的业务经营制度。该社成立于去年六月，由市供销总社结合着区政府区妇女工作组共同发起组成，成员多是失业工人、家庭妇女。目的是解决本人生活和补助家庭。当时有社员四十九人，社股六十一股，合小米三百零五斤。又向合作银行贷款四十五万元和十匹白布，七月初开始进行生产。当时缺乏经营经验，没有生产计划，大部分资金买了家具，而缩小了生产资金。同时多数社员不了解必须使自己的产品适合于一般消费者，尤其是劳动人民的需要，才能推广销路争取市场，只是盲目的想和私商斗争，改变制做毛底帆布鞋的原定计划，开始便做冲服呢千层底鞋。由于经营不好，生产技术不够熟练，致使成本高，产品质量低劣，推销不出去。七月份生产八十双鞋，只卖掉三双；八月份生产一百二十九双也只卖掉二十九双，资金无法周转。再加上生产管理方面未贯彻民主精神，所以引起社员普遍不满，并有十六个社员退了社，使九月份的生产陷于半停顿的状态。九月下旬，市供销合作总社发觉这些问题后，即强调指出：“生产必须面向群众，管理必须发扬民主。”并派干部去帮助他们调整组织，召开社员大会，组织社员小组，选举了合作社的管理人员，又吸收了有技术的工人入社。在这一阶段内，共发展社员四十五人。在业务方面，由于改善了经营方法，计算好产品的成本，主动的拿着样品到各处寻找订户，并征求对产品的意见，所以在十月以后业务获得发展，承做了革大、公安局、军需部等单位一万三千五百多双棉鞋和皮鞋。在此期间，社员都忙着做鞋，没有注意到科学分工和生产管理，致使五千双皮鞋的订款，没有及时买到原料，受到物价波动的影响；在购买皮料时，又受了奸商的欺骗，一万多尺的皮料，短了一千三百多尺；再加上对仓库管理的疏忽大意，使库存的鞋帮又短了五百双。总计这次损失约为两万七千多斤小米，使刚才抬头的业务又受到严重的打击。经过这两次教训，该社检讨了失败的原因，并得出几点经验：一、建立生产社必须以技术工人为骨干；二、发扬民主管理；三、实行科学管理，注意成本核算；四、生产社的干部必须兼备生产和经营业务的知识。所以在今年元月，该社又重新整顿了组织，建立了分工负责、劳动纪律、会计、传票等各种制度。为了增加生产资金，不间断生产，又号召社员多入股，现在该社已有社员一百四十五人，社股四百六十五股，合小米两千三百二十五斤。在生产皮鞋和布鞋的系统下，又设有七个生产小组，每组选出组长，负责分配活计和检查工作。一月中旬加入联合社之后，资金与包活问题更加有了保障，所以现在社员的工作情绪都很高。很多人都起早贪黑的赶着做工。并且在提高技术节省原料等方面也收到初步成绩。如从前纳鞋底每方寸约纳五十针，现在能纳七十针；从前每码布能做六双鞋，现在能做七双。一月份共生产了布鞋五千五百双，皮鞋一千双，净获利七百六十万元。该社现已订出今年上半年的生产计划，平均每月可生产一万零五百双布鞋和两千双皮鞋，每双利润按半斤小米计算，半年可获利三万七千五百斤小米，除了弥补去年的损失，尚可获利一万多斤小米。
