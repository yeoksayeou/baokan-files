　　U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Economic Aggression
    Attempts to Turn Japan into an "Asian Factory"
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 17th] While actively arranging for Japan to become a base for launching a new war, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its economic aggression plan to turn Japan into an "Asian factory." The "Southeast Asia Delegation," jointly organized by the U.S. government and MacArthur Headquarters in January to "investigate" trade between Japan and Southeast Asian countries and the supply of food to Japan, recently returned to Japan. Led by Mr. Anjous, Director of the Foreign Agricultural Relations Department of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the delegation visited Thailand, Singapore, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and the Philippines to conduct "investigations."

    According to a statement released by the "investigation team" in Tokyo on March 14th, quoted by the Associated Press, Japanese industrial products controlled by U.S. monopoly capital will be dumped into Southeast Asian countries in large quantities. The statement said: "There are now good signs for establishing new trade and expanding existing trade agreements between Japan and its Asian neighbors." An official at MacArthur Headquarters said: "Several such trade agreements have already been signed." At the same time, Anjous revealed the U.S. economic aggression plan of "capital from the United States, technology from Japan, and raw materials from Southeast Asia." Summarizing the results of the "investigation," he said: "Japan can provide technical assistance to many regions in need of industrial and economic 'revival,' while these regions can supply Japan with raw materials and much-needed food" (United Press).

　　美帝加紧进行经济侵略
    图变日本为“亚洲工厂”
    【新华社十七日讯】与积极布置使日本成为发动新战争基地的同时，美帝国主义正加紧进行变日本为“亚洲工厂”的经济侵略计划。一月间由美国政府和麦克阿瑟总部联合组织的赴东南亚各国“调查”对日贸易和对日食粮供应的“东南亚代表团”，已于最近返回日本。该团在团长美国农业部对外农业关系司司长安竹斯的率领下，曾历经泰国、新加坡、马来亚、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰以及菲律宾等地，进行“调查”。
    据美联社引“调查团”三月十四日在东京发表的声明透露，为美国垄断资本所控制的日本工业生产品，将向东南亚各国大量倾销。该声明称：“对于日本与其亚洲邻国之间建立新的贸易和扩大目前的贸易协定一事，现在已有良好的迹象”。麦克阿瑟总部一官员则称：“这样的贸易协定已签订了好几个”。同时，安竹斯吐露了“资本美国、技术日本、原料东南亚”的美国经济侵略方案。他在总结“调查”结果时说：“日本能给许多需要工业与经济‘复兴’的地区以技术援助，这些地区则能供应日本原料和极感需要的食粮”（合众社）。
