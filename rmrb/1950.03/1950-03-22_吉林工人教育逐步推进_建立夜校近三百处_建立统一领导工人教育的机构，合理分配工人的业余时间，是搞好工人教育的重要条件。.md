　　Jilin Worker Education Progresses Steadily
    Establishing Nearly 300 Night Schools
    Establishing an organization to uniformly lead worker education and rationally allocating workers' spare time are important conditions for doing a good job in worker education.
    [Our report] The Cultural and Educational Department of the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions reports: Since February of last year, various parts of Jilin Province have generally begun to pay attention to and strengthen worker education, especially worker cultural education. Regarding teaching content, in old liberated areas and some larger enterprises with normal production, cultural education is generally the focus, combined with political and technical education. In semi-old liberated areas, new areas, and enterprises that have not yet entered normal production, some still focus on or conduct more political education, while others began to focus on cultural education in the second half of the year. Worker learning organizations, in areas or enterprises where cultural education is the main focus, generally adopted the form of night schools (larger state-owned and public-private joint enterprises establish night schools on an enterprise basis, while smaller state-owned, public-private joint, and private enterprises form them based on region or street). Each night school has begun to teach in classes divided by the students' levels and has also piloted some regular night schools, gaining some initial experience. According to incomplete statistics, 288 night schools focusing on cultural learning have been established throughout the province, with more than 19,000 students, accounting for approximately 25% to 30% of illiterate and semi-literate workers in the province. In Jilin City, the number of workers enrolled has reached 54% of illiterate and semi-literate workers.
    The main achievements of worker education over the past year are that the class consciousness of workers has been generally further improved, a new work attitude has been basically established, high labor enthusiasm and creativity have been brought into play, and relatively clear understandings have been gained regarding public-private relations, labor-capital relations, the Party and the People's Government, national and internationalist ideology, especially regarding studying the Soviet Union. At the same time, due to the gradual improvement of workers' lives, cultural life has become much more active than before, and workers have begun to urgently demand cultural and technical learning, laying the foundation for future standardized worker spare-time education.
    The main shortcomings of the past year: First, some regions and enterprises failed to clearly grasp the direction of worker education. After the initial political education, they did not transition to focusing on cultural education in a timely manner, thereby affecting the implementation of workers' cultural learning plans and failing to meet workers' learning needs. In terms of political education, generally speaking across the province, there was no relatively complete plan in the past, lacking foresight and initiative, with learning often based on whatever was available. Teaching materials were not unified, and there was no system. In addition, some regions spent a lot of effort on street worker night schools but did not pay more attention to worker learning in larger state-owned and public-private joint enterprises. Even in larger public-private joint enterprises, night schools were not organized on an enterprise basis, but workers from these enterprises were organized into street night schools. Due to the inconsistent working hours of public-private joint and private enterprises, worker learning was affected. Second, many night schools cannot maintain regular learning. Some have very high learning enthusiasm at the beginning, but after some time, they gradually slacken and even collapse. After rectification, they become tense for a while, and then gradually loosen again, in such a cyclical fluctuation, affecting the normal progress of learning. For example, the provincial-run match factory's worker night school held seven opening ceremonies throughout the year. Some night schools, after the previous term ended, could not start the next term, forming an interruption, and learning was not connected. These results stem from two causes: On the one hand, some enterprises still have formalism in worker education, not starting from the actual needs of workers, but eager for quick success and seeking a temporary sensation, or overemphasizing standardization when conditions are not yet ripe, even adopting methods such as "not allowing workers to go home after work" to force workers to learn; or occupying one hour of production time for learning, which hinders production and affects the wage income of piece-rate workers, so learning cannot be sustained. Conversely, some enterprises cannot guarantee workers' learning time, and learning is often disrupted when production is tight, there are many meetings, or work is busy. In many enterprises, workers' learning time is squeezed out due to crash production, Party building, Youth League building, discussions of labor protection issues, and the signing of various contracts.
    According to the experience of Jilin City, a unified organization for leading worker education should be established in cities, jointly composed of the Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Trade Union Cultural and Educational Department, the government education department, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation. The Party Committee Propaganda Department is responsible for overall leadership, the Trade Union Cultural and Educational Department is responsible for specific work, and the government, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation provide strong assistance and close cooperation. Its tasks mainly include grasping the implementation of educational guidelines, formulating unified educational plans, and unifying the strength and pace of various departments. This can overcome many difficulties in worker education. Regular worker spare-time schools should be vigorously promoted in the future, but not hastily. They should be carried out with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner. More importantly, workers' learning time should be adequately guaranteed. At the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions Cultural and Educational Work Conference held last December, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions proposed a suggestion: The enterprise administration should not occupy more than two hours of employees' spare time per week. Learning can be conducted four days a week (two hours each day), two days can be used for administrative and Party and Youth League meetings, etc., and one day for rest. It is hoped that this suggestion can be submitted to the Party and government for approval and promulgation as soon as possible.

　　吉林工人教育逐步推进
    建立夜校近三百处
    建立统一领导工人教育的机构，合理分配工人的业余时间，是搞好工人教育的重要条件。
    【本报讯】吉林省总工会文教部报导：自去年二月以来，吉林省各地一般地开始注意与加强了工人教育，特别是工人文化教育工作。在教学内容上，老区和一部分生产正常的较大企业中，一般以文化教育为主，结合进行政治教育与技术教育；在半老区、新区以及尚未进入正常生产的企业中，有的仍然着重于或比较多地进行政治教育，有的在下半年开始以文化教育为主。工人的学习组织，在以文化教育为主的地区或企业中，一般地采用了夜校的形式（规模较大的国营、公营企业，以企业为单位成立夜校，规模较小的国营、公营和私营企业，则依区域或街道组成）。各夜校已开始按学员程度分班教学，并试办了一部分正规夜校，也取得了一些初步经验。据不完全统计：全省已建立以文化学习为主的夜校二百八十八处，有学员一万九千余人，约占全省文盲、半文盲工人的百分之二十五到三十。吉林市则入学工人已占文盲、半文盲工人的百分之五十四。
    一年来工人教育工作的主要收获，是工人的阶级觉悟已有了普遍的进一步的提高，基本上建立了新的劳动态度，发挥了高度劳动热情与创造性，对于公私关系、劳资关系、党和人民政府、国家与国际主义思想，尤其是对学习苏联等问题有了比较明确的认识。同时，由于工人生活的逐渐改善，文化生活较前大大活跃，工人们开始迫切要求文化学习与技术学习，为今后正规化的工人业余教育创立了基础。
    一年来的主要缺点：第一，有的地区与企业中对工人教育的方针未能明确掌握，经过了初期政治教育之后，未适时地转入以文化教育为主，因而影响工人文化学习计划的贯彻执行，且与工人的学习要求不相符合。在政治教育方面，就全省来说，过去一般是没有比较完整的计划，缺乏预见性和主动性，多是来了什么学什么，教材不统一，没有系统。此外，有的地区对街道工人夜校花了不少力气，但没有更多地注视到较大的国营公营企业中的工人学习。甚至在较大的公营企业中，不以企业为单位组织夜校，而把这些企业中的工人组织到街道夜校中去。由于公私营企业的工作时间不一致，影响了工人学习。第二，许多夜校不能坚持经常的学习。有的是开始时学习情绪很高，过了一些时间便渐渐松懈以至垮台，经过整顿又紧张一些时候，以后又逐渐松下去，如此循环起伏，影响了学习的正常进行。如省营火柴厂的工人夜校，全年举行了七次开学典礼；有的夜校则是上期结业后，下期不能开学，形成中断，学习连接不上。这些结果是从两种原因产生的：一方面有的企业中对工人教育还存在着形式主义，不是从工人的实际需要出发，而急于求成，追求一时的轰轰烈烈，或者条件尚未成熟就过分强调正规化，甚至采取“下工后不准回家”的方法强迫工人学习；或占用一小时生产时间来进行学习，既妨碍生产，又使计件工人的工资收入受影响，因此学习不能坚持。相反的，有些企业则不能保证工人的学习时间，每每在生产紧张、会议多、工作忙的时候把学习搞垮了，不少企业中因为突击生产、建党、建团、讨论劳保问题、订各种合同等把工人的学习时间挤掉了。
    根据吉林市的经验，在城市中，应建立统一的领导工人教育的机构。由党委宣传部、工会文教部、政府教育部门及青年团、妇联等共同组成；党委宣传部负责总的领导，工会文教部负责具体工作，政府、青年团、妇联等给以大力帮助与密切配合。它的任务，主要是掌握教育方针的执行，制订统一的教育计划，统一各个部门的力量与步调。这样可以克服工人教育中许多困难。对于正规化工人业余学校，今后要大力推行，但不能性急，应当有重点地有步骤地进行。更重要的，是工人的学习时间应有适当保证，去年十二月东北总工会召开的文教工作会议上，东北总工会曾提出建议：企业行政占用职工的业余时间，每星期不得超过两小时。每星期中，可以四天（每天两小时）进行学习，两天为行政与党、团开会等之用，一天休息。希望这一建议能尽速提交党和政府批准公布。
