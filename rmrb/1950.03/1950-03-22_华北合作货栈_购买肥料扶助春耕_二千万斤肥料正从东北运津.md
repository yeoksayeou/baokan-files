　　North China Cooperative Depot
    Purchases Fertilizer to Support Spring Plowing
    20 Million Jin of Fertilizer Being Shipped from Northeast to Tianjin
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Cooperative Depot is vigorously supporting spring plowing by purchasing over 24 million jin of fertilizer on behalf of cooperative societies in various regions, and has also entered into sales contracts with various fertilizer factories in Tianjin. The depot, in light of the severe disasters in North China last year, where in some areas such as Hengshui and Xingtai, disaster victims used animal manure, tree leaves, wheat straw, and other materials that could be used as soil fertilizer as fuel, and although the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative promptly provided disaster victims with over 50,000 tons of coal in order to preserve spring plowing fertilizer, the locally stored fertilizer alone was clearly insufficient for the needs of this spring's large-scale production. Therefore, the North China Cooperative Depot purchased fertilizer on behalf of various regions in order to prepare early and benefit rural spring plowing. By early March, the amount of fertilizer registered for purchase by various regions had reached 27 million jin, and the depot purchased 10 million jin of soybean cake from the Northeast, and in cooperation with the Cooperative Department of the Tianjin People's Bank Branch, purchased another 10 million jin, which are now being continuously shipped to Tianjin. At the same time, the depot also purchased over 4 million jin of oil cake from various public and private oil mills in Tianjin. In addition, the depot organized major fertilizer factories through the Tianjin Fertilizer Industry Union and entered into sales contracts with them; the contracts stipulated that manure must not be adulterated or mixed with inferior materials, breaking the long-standing bad habit of mixing 60% cinder ash. It has already sold 1.55 million jin of manure on their behalf. Cooperative societies in various regions have expressed satisfaction with the quality of the fertilizer. (Zou Jun)

　　华北合作货栈
    购买肥料扶助春耕
    二千万斤肥料正从东北运津
    【本报讯】华北合作货栈大力扶助春耕，代各地合作社购买肥料二千四百余万斤，并与津市各粪厂订立代销合同。该栈鉴于去年华北各地灾情严重，有些地区如衡水、邢台一带，灾民将牲口粪及树叶、麦秸等可作土粪的原料当作燃料，后虽经河北省供销总社及时贷给灾民煤五万余吨，以期保存春耕肥料，但仅靠本地所存肥料显然不敷今春大生产之需。为此，华北合作货栈乃代各地购买肥料，以便及早准备，以利农村春耕。只三月初各地登记购买肥料者已达二千七百万斤，该栈乃从东北购买豆饼一千万斤，并与天津人民银行分行合作部联合再购买一千万斤，现正络续运津。同时该栈又在津市向各公私营油厂购油饼四百余万斤。此外该栈并通过天津市粪业工会将各大粪厂加以组织，并与之订立代销合同；合同内规定大粪不准掺杂混蒙，把历年来掺百分之六十炉灰的恶习打破。现已代其销出大粪一百五十五万斤。各地合作社对肥料质料均表满意。（邹郡）
