Huiwen Middle School Plans to Closely Integrate Production with Learning

[This newspaper dispatch] Beijing News: Huiwen Middle School in Beijing has formulated a production plan that closely integrates with learning. The plan is divided into four parts: In terms of planting, of the thirty-five mu of land allocated, seven or eight mu have already been planted with spring wheat and need continued cultivation, while the rest will be used to grow vegetables. The varieties will be determined according to the season, generally including Chinese cabbage, potatoes, spinach, etc. In terms of management, experienced workers and teachers will be hired to provide specific guidance. Four teachers and two workers have already been hired. On the 17th, the principal and others visited the production area to inspect the site; Mr. Pu Ke Gang drew up the plans and calculated the acreage to allocate work. For practical needs, the school plans to purchase a waterwheel to use the wells on the land for irrigation. It is also preparing to mobilize students to build two small houses on the land for taking care of the fields and storing tools. The organizational work mainly involves mobilizing students, allocating labor and production tools. The plan specifically addresses the issue of integrating production with learning, not only ensuring that production does not hinder learning but also further making production beneficial to learning. The school's biology teacher plans to lecture on the process of seed germination and growth, and methods for preventing insect pests. The geography teacher plans to lecture on soil and climate, and the chemistry teacher will talk about the hard and soft properties of water and their relationship to plants. Turning going to the countryside for production into a laboratory for class. The above plan is divided into planning, management, organization, and learning departments under the school's production committee which are responsible for implementation.
This plan has greatly encouraged the students' production enthusiasm and confidence. Now, in addition to more than a thousand people signing up to participate in off-campus production, the on-campus land is being fully developed under the leadership of Mr. Xu, the clerk.

　　汇文中学拟订计划生产学习密切结合
    【本报讯】京市汇文中学已拟定与学习密切结合的生产计划。该计划分为四部：种植方面，所分到的三十五亩地内，除有七、八亩原已种好春麦尚待继续培养外，其余均种植菜蔬。品类则按季节而定，大致为白菜、土豆、菠菜等。经营方面，聘请有经验的工友、老师做具体指导。现已聘就四位老师，两位工友。十七日校长等曾到生产区实地察看；由浦克刚先生画好图样，统计亩数，以分配工作。为了实际需要，校方计划购买水车一架，利用地里的水井灌溉。并准备发动同学，在地内建筑小房两栋，做为照顾田园、保管工具之用。组织工作主要是发动同学，分配劳动力和生产工具。该计划特别提出生产与学习结合的问题。不但使生产不妨碍学习，且要进一步使生产有利学习。该校生物学先生准备讲种子发芽生长过程，及虫害预防方法。教地理的先生准备讲土壤、气候，教化学的先生则讲水的软硬性质与植物的关系。把下乡生产变为上课的实验室。上述计划分由该校生产委员会下设的计划、经营、组织、学习四部负责执行。
    这一计划大大鼓舞了同学们的生产情绪和信心。现在除一千多人签名参加校外生产外，校内则由事务员许先生领导，把可耕之地全部开辟。
