　　Introduction to the Soviet Supreme Soviet Election Law

　　On January 9th of this year, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union announced the Election Law of the Supreme Soviet. The election law makes comprehensive and detailed provisions for the election system, voter lists, electoral districts, election committees, procedures and methods for nominating candidates, voting procedures and methods, and determining election results, in order to ensure that Soviet voters fully exercise their universal, equal, and direct right to vote, and elect their representatives by secret ballot.
　　　　Electoral Districts, Election Committees, Representative Candidates
　　According to the Soviet Constitution, the Soviet of the Union is elected according to electoral districts, with one electoral district established for every 300,000 residents, and one representative elected for each electoral district. In this election, a total of 671 electoral districts were established for the Soviet of the Union. The electoral districts for the Soviet of Nationalities are composed according to the following proportions: each Union Republic has 25 districts, each Autonomous Republic has 11 districts, each Autonomous Region has 5 districts, and each National District has 1 district. Each electoral district elects one representative. In this election, a total of 631 electoral districts were established for the Soviet of Nationalities.

　　The election law stipulates that the election committee shall be composed of representatives of trade union organizations of workers and staff, cooperative organizations, communist party organizations, youth organizations, representatives of various cultural, technical, and scientific societies and other public organizations and legally registered labor people's societies, as well as representatives produced at workers and staff congresses of factories and institutions, representatives of active military personnel in the armed forces, representatives produced at collective farm, village, and rural area peasant congresses, and representatives of workers and staff of state-owned farms.

　　Public organizations and labor people's societies, such as communist party organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, youth organizations, and cultural societies, all have the right to nominate candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　Candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet can only be voted on by voters within one electoral district. That is to say, voters in one electoral district cannot elect representative candidates from other electoral districts.

　　Representative candidates cannot serve as members of the district election committee handling matters related to the election of the Soviet of the Union or the Soviet of Nationalities, nor can they serve as members of the sub-district election committee to which the electoral district where they are nominated as representative candidates belongs.
　　　　 Suffrage, Eligibility for Election, Polling Places

　　According to the Soviet Constitution, all Soviet citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of race, sex, religious belief, educational qualification, length of residence, social origin, property status, or past activities, have the right to participate in the election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, except for those who are mentally ill or have been deprived of electoral rights by a court judgment. All Soviet citizens who have reached the age of twenty-three can be elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. All citizens participate in elections on an equal footing, with each person having one vote. Women enjoy the same rights as men and have the right to vote and be elected; citizens serving in the armed forces also enjoy the same right to vote and be elected. Candidates are nominated by electoral district, and the relevant expenses for the election are paid by the state.

　　All Soviet citizens with the right to vote are included in the voter list. No one may be included in more than one voter list. The voter list is compiled by the executive committee of the workers' representative Soviet at all levels, and the voter list in the armed forces is compiled and signed by the commander. After the list is compiled, it must be posted thirty days before the election for review, and voters are guaranteed to be able to see these lists. If there are any inaccuracies in the list, voters may submit a statement, and the responsible Soviet must respond within three days; if the declarant disagrees with this response, they may also file a complaint with the People's Court, and the court's judgment is final.

　　To facilitate voters who relocate before election day, it is stipulated that they may send a certificate of the right to vote to the responsible Soviet to indicate "relocation," and they can be included in the voter list after submitting the certificate to their new residence.

　　Several polling places are usually established in each electoral district to carry out work. The polling place is established by the executive committee of the workers' representative Soviet. Usually, one polling place is established in areas with 1,500 to 3,000 residents. However, for remote areas, special circumstances, and voters traveling, more polling places are established to facilitate their exercise of the right to vote. In small villages with 300 to 500 residents, if the distance to the election center exceeds ten kilometers, a separate polling place may be established; in remote areas of eastern and northern Soviet Union, a polling place may be established for 100 or more residents, and in mountainous and nomadic areas of the northern Soviet Union, a polling place may be established for 50 or more residents. Polling places can be established in hospitals, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, and homes for the disabled with no fewer than 50 voters. Vessels sailing on election day or long-distance passenger trains with no fewer than 25 voters can establish polling places to receive ballots from voters with "certificates of the right to vote."

　　The polling place must be established one and a half months before the election so that every voter knows in advance where they will participate in voting, checks whether they have been accurately included in the voter list, and raises all questions related to the election.
　　　　Election Procedures

　　According to the election law, the election of the Supreme Soviet must be held on the same day throughout the Soviet Union and must be held on a non-working day. Voters vote on election day from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. local time.

　　On election day, the chairman of the district election committee shall, in the presence of the members of the committee, check the ballot box and voter list in the prescribed form at 6:00 a.m., seal the ballot box with the committee's seal, and then invite voters to vote.

　　Each polling place has a specially designated room or a partitioned cubicle for voters to fill out their ballots. While voters are filling out their ballots, anyone (including members of the election committee) is prohibited from entering the room except for the voter.

　　When a voter arrives at the polling place, they shall present a certificate, a certificate from a collective farm, or a membership card from a trade union. After verifying the certificate and the voter list and marking the voter list, the voter can receive the official ballot. The voter leaves the name of the candidate they want to elect on the ballot, circles out the remaining names, and then puts the ballot into the ballot box. Voters who cannot fill out the ballot themselves due to illiteracy or physical disability have the right to invite any other voter to enter the room to fill out the ballot on their behalf.

　　Election propaganda is prohibited during voting.

　　Representatives of public organizations and labor people's societies and representatives of the press have the right to visit the room when the district election committee counts the votes. Candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union who receive an absolute majority of votes (that is, more than half of the total number of valid votes determined in the electoral district) are considered elected.

　　If the number of ballots is less than half of the number of voters eligible to vote in the district, the district election committee shall record the facts and immediately notify the central election committee. In this case, the central election committee shall designate a new election to be held within two weeks after the election.

　　Anyone who obstructs Soviet citizens from freely exercising their right to vote and be elected by means of violence, deception, threat, or bribery shall be subject to a sentence of deprivation of freedom for up to two years.

　　Soviet personnel or members of the election committee who forge election documents or intentionally misreport the number of votes shall be subject to a sentence of deprivation of freedom for up to three years.

　　苏联最高苏维埃选举法介绍
    今年一月九日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团公布了最高苏维埃选举法。选举法对选举制度、选民名单、选举区、选举委员会、候选人提名程序及办法、投票程序及办法，和确定选举结果等项，作了周密详尽的规定，以保障苏联选民充分行使其普遍、平等、直接的选举权，并用秘密投票方法选出他们的代表。
            选区、选举委员会、代表候选人
    根据苏联宪法，苏维埃联盟院按照选区选举，每三十万居民成立一个选区，每一选区选举代表一人。这次选举中联盟院共成立了六七一个选区。民族院的选区根据如下比例组成：每一加盟共和国有二十五区，每一自治共和国有十一区，每一自治州有五区，每一民族区有一区。每一选区选出代表一人。这次选举中民族院共成立了六三一个选区。
    选举法规定：选举委员会由工人与职员的工会组织、合作社组织、共产党组织、青年组织的代表，各种文化、技术与科学会社及其他公共组织和依法登记的劳动人民会社的代表，还有工厂与机关的工人与职员大会上产生的代表，部队中现役军人的代表，集体农场、村庄与乡村地区农民大会上产生的代表，国营农场的工人与职员代表等组成。
    公共组织和劳动人民的会社，如共产党组织、工会、合作社、青年组织及文化会社等，均有权提名苏联最高苏维埃代表的候选人。
    最高苏维埃代表候选人，仅能由一个选区内的选民投票表决。这就是说，一个选区的选民不能选举别个选区的代表候选人。
    代表候选人不能充任办理苏维埃联盟院或苏维埃民族院选举事宜的区选举委员会委员，也不能充任其被提名为代表候选人之选区所属的分区选举委员会的委员。
            选举权、被选举权、选举处
    根据苏联宪法，不分种族、性别、宗教信仰、教育资格、居住期限、社会出身、财产状况及过去的活动如何，凡年满十八岁的苏联公民，均有权参加苏联最高苏维埃代表的选举，只有精神病患者和被法庭判决褫夺选举权者除外。凡年满二十三岁的苏联公民，都可当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。所有公民均以平等地位参加选举，每人有一票选举权。妇女享有与男子同等的权利，有选举与被选举权；在部队中服役的公民也享有同等的选举与被选举权。候选人按选区提出，进行选举的有关费用，概由国家支付。
    凡有选举权的苏联公民，都编入选民名单中。任何人不得编入一个以上的选民名单。选民名单由各级劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会编制，部队中的选民名单则由指挥员编造签名。名单编造完竣后，须在选举前三十日张贴，以供周览，并保证选民都能看到这些名单。如名单中有不正确处，选民得提出声明书，负责的苏维埃须在三日内答复；如声明人不同意这种答复，还可以向人民法庭提出控诉，而以法庭判决为最后决定。
    为便利在选举日前迁居的选民，规定他们可以投票权证明书送请负责的苏维埃注明“迁出”，在新居住地缴验证明书后即可编入选民名单。
    在各选区内通常设立若干选举处，以进行工作。选举处由劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会负责成立。通常在一千五百到三千居民的地区设立一个选举处。但对于边远地区、特殊情况以及在旅行中的选民，则设立更多的选举处，以便利他们行使选举权。在凡有居民三百至五百人的小村，如到选举中心地的距离超过十公里，即可单独设立选举处；在苏联东部和北部偏远地区，一百居民以上即可设立选举处，在北部山区和游牧区，五十居民以上即可设立选举处。在选举人不少于五十人的病院、产科医院、疗养院、残废院内，都可以设立选举处。凡有选举人二十五人以上而于选举日适在航行中的轮船，或长距离旅客列车，都可以设立选举处，接收有“投票权证明书”的选民的选票。
    选举处须在选举前一个半月成立，使每一个选民预先知道他将在那里参加投票，检查他是否无误地编入了选民名单，及提出有关选举的一切问题。
            选举程序
    按照选举法规定，最高苏维埃的选举，全苏联须在同一天内举行，并须在非工作日举行。选民在选举日从当地时间午前六时起，至午后十二时为止，进行投票。
    在选举日，区选举委员会主席于午前六时在各委员面前，按照规定形式检查票箱和选民名单，用委员会的印记封闭票箱，然后请选民投票。
    各选举处都特辟房间，或布置分隔开来的小室，以供选民填写选票。在选民写票时，除投票人外，禁止任何人（包括选举委员会委员在内）入室。
    选民到达选举处时，应出示证明书，或集体农场的证件，或职工会的会证，待验明证件及选民名单，并在选民名单上标明记号之后，选民即可领取正式选票。选民在选票上留下他要选举的候选人的名字，圈掉其余的名字，然后将选票投进票箱。凡因不识字或身体上的残废而不能亲自填写选票的选民，有权邀请任何其他选民进去代为填写选票。
    进行投票时，禁止选举宣传。
    在区选举委员会点票室内计算投票数目时，公共组织和劳动人民会社的特派代表及新闻界代表，有权到室中参观。凡获得绝对多数选票（即在选区被确定有效投票总数中获得半数以上的选票）的苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人，即认为当选人。
    如选票数少于该区有权投票的选民人数的一半，该区选举委员会应记录实情，立即通知中央选举委员会。在此种情况下，中央选举委员会应指定于选举后的两星期以内举行新选举。
    凡用暴力、欺骗、威胁或贿赂手段，阻挠苏联公民自由行使其选举权及被选举权者，将受两年以下的褫夺自由的处分。
    凡伪造选举文件或蓄意虚报票数的苏维埃人员或选举委员会委员，将受三年以下的褫夺自由的处分。
