To Comrades Cong Zhanjie, Zhang Zemin, Zhang Buzeng, Yue Fa, Zhao Yushu, and Yan Ling:

    The answers to your inquiries are as follows:

    Since liberation, the People's Government of Beijing has begun registering unemployed personnel. However, because most of the unemployed in the city are unwilling to work in the countryside, there have been many registrations but few actual solutions in the past year. Nevertheless, the People's Government is still handling this work, adopting a method of individual registration and individual solutions. If you want to register, you can apply at any time to the Social Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, located at Nanwei Hutong, Xisi North.

To Comrades Liu Dequan, He Ming, and Hao Jianmin:

    Since August 24th of last year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has been processing immigration to Chahar and Suiyuan, with plans to move 5,000 people to Suiyuan and 10,000 people to Chahar. Since the 11th of this month, the transfer to Suiyuan has begun, and five batches have been transferred as of the 17th, totaling 2,500 people. This work is still ongoing. Transfers to Chahar have also begun since the 20th. If you are determined to engage in agricultural production and settle down in the Northwest, you can quickly register at your local district office, and you can leave within three to five days after registration. As for workers going to the Northeast, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has also contacted the Benxi Coal and Iron Company and is temporarily introducing 500 ordinary workers to participate in loading, unloading, and transportation work. Registration for workers going to the Northeast is also being handled simultaneously by the district offices.

    However, the above immigration is limited to citizens of Beijing. Those going to the Northwest must bring their families, as single individuals will face more difficulties that are difficult to solve.

### 北京仍在办理移民察绥  失业市民仍可到主管机关申请登记

　　北京仍在办理移民察绥
    失业市民仍可到主管机关申请登记丛占介、张泽民、张布增、越发、赵玉书、燕苓诸先生：
    兹将你们所询的问题，一并解答如下：
    北京市自从解放以后，人民政府就开始办理失业人员登记。但因为都市里的失业人员，大都不愿意下乡工作，一年来登记者多，而实际获得解决者少。虽然如此，这项工作，人民政府至今仍在办理，采取个别登记、个别解决的办法。你们如要登记，可随时到西四北南魏胡同北京市人民政府民政局社会科去申请。刘德全、鹤鸣、郝健民先生：
    从去年八月二十四日开始，北京市人民政府即办理移民察绥工作，预计移到绥远五千人，移到察哈尔一万人。从本月十一日起，去绥远的已开始移送，截至十七日已经移送了五批，一共是两千五百人。这项工作，现仍在继续办理。从二十日起，并已开始向察哈尔移送。你们如果有决心到西北从事农业生产安家立业的，可以赶快到自己居住地区的区公所去登记，登记以后三五天里就可以起身。至于到东北去的工人，北京市人民政府民政局也已与本溪煤铁公司接洽妥，暂时介绍给他们五百个普通工人，去参加装卸和运输工作。这个去东北的工人登记，各区区公所也正在同时办理着。
    不过，以上移民，都只限于北京市市民。而去西北的，并须携有家属，因为独身的人去了会有较多的困难不好解决。
