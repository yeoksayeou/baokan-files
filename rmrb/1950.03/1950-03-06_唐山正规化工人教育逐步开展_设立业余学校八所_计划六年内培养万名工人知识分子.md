　　Tangshan Gradually Carries Out Regularized Worker Education
　　Eight Part-time Schools Established
　　Plan to Train 10,000 Worker-Intellectuals in Six Years
　　[This Newspaper’s News] Under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, major public and private factories and mines in Tangshan have established eight regularized worker part-time schools (hereinafter referred to as "worker schools") since November of last year. There are a total of 3,720 students. The students in each school are progressing rapidly in their studies. For example, the first-grade students in the primary school of the Tangshan Railway Factory worker school, who were originally illiterate, have learned more than 300 characters and addition, subtraction, and three-digit multiplication after three months of study. It is expected that within six years, the educational level of the illiterate workers who enroll can be raised to the level of junior high school graduation.
　　After the liberation of Tangshan, the trade unions in various factories and mines widely carried out initial political education among the workers and partially established some cultural learning organizations. In order to meet the demands of the vast number of workers to continue to systematically improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions decided to organize large-scale regularized worker part-time schools. These were first established at the Railway Factory, Huaxin Textile Factory, and other places. The plan is to gradually promote them and train 10,000 worker-intellectuals within six years. In order to centralize the leadership of worker education in the city, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Education Bureau, and some responsible cadres of factory and mine worker schools formed the Municipal Worker Education Committee. They uniformly stipulated the educational guidelines, academic system, and teaching materials of the worker schools, and formulated an educational plan. It was decided that worker schools should be established separately in larger public and private factories and mines, and worker schools should be jointly organized by smaller factories. The funding for the worker schools is paid from the trade union's cultural and educational funds. Each worker school has a principal and a director of studies, each of whom is concurrently held by the party, government, and trade union leaders of the factory or mine; in addition, there are vice principals and vice directors of studies, who are concurrently held by full-time teachers. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has uniformly recruited 43 full-time teachers for each worker school. Experience has proven that hiring full-time teachers is an important factor in running worker schools well. For example, the teachers of the worker study classes previously run by the Huaxin Textile Factory and the Railway Factory were mostly part-time. Because they were busy with their work, they did not have enough time to prepare lessons, and they were often absent, which affected the workers' enthusiasm for learning. Moreover, part-time teachers could only teach classes in the evening, so workers on night shifts could not participate in learning. Since there have been full-time teachers, these difficulties have been resolved. Teachers have ample time to prepare lessons and correct student assignments; class times are divided into day and night shifts, with the same progress, and workers can continue to study as usual after switching shifts day and night. Full-time teachers can also go deep into the workshops to tutor workers in their studies, which greatly improves the workers' learning effectiveness. However, at present, the trade union's cultural and educational funds are limited, and full-time teachers cannot be assigned to all worker schools. The remedy is to carefully select candidates when hiring part-time teachers, requiring them to prepare and attend classes on time, and to ask for leave and arrange for substitute teachers in advance when they are absent due to unforeseen circumstances.
　　The academic system of the worker schools is divided into three sections: junior high school, senior primary school, and junior primary school, each with three grades. Junior and senior primary schools graduate in one and a half years each, and junior high school graduates in three years. Each school divides classes according to the current cultural level of the workers after testing. At present, most worker schools only have junior and senior primary school sections. Only the Railway Factory worker school has added a middle school section, and the Huaxin Textile Factory worker school has established a middle school preparatory class. Recently, Kailuan Tangshan Coal Mine is also preparing to establish a middle school section. In order to take care of the unevenness of the students' levels in various subjects, each worker school has adopted a mixed class system. For example, some students study Chinese in the third grade of junior primary school, while arithmetic is in the second grade.
　　The primary school curriculum of the worker schools focuses on Chinese and arithmetic. After graduating from junior primary school, the Chinese level is required to be able to read newspapers and express one's own thoughts in simple words; arithmetic learns the four arithmetic operations of integers and decimals. After graduating from senior primary school, the requirements are: to be able to write fluent manuscripts, learn the arithmetic operations of fractions, percentages, and proportions, and be able to make simple statistical charts; in addition, complete senior primary school natural science, geography, and preliminary political theory. Junior high school requires reaching a level equivalent to that of ordinary junior vocational and technical schools. According to the situation of the past three months of classes, these requirements are completely achievable. Because most workers have rich life experience and production knowledge, and their comprehension is very strong. Some workers, although illiterate, can give a very moving speech; although they do not recognize Arabic numerals, they can perform simple calculations. Moreover, they all have a high enthusiasm for learning.
　　Each worker school generally plans to teach for 24 weeks every six months. Classes are held five days a week, two hours a day; two days a week are reserved for workers to handle housework or party, government, trade union, and youth league meetings, so that everyone can study with peace of mind.
　　The administrative departments of various factories and mines have made appropriate solutions to the various difficulties encountered by workers in their studies. For example, at the Huaxin Textile Factory worker school, many students live far from home, and it is inconvenient to travel back and forth in the dark. The factory has specially repaired two dormitories that can accommodate 400 workers. At the same time, the trade union and the cooperative canteen have agreed to increase the supply of coarse grain meals, which has solved the food and lodging problems of the studying workers.

　　唐山正规化工人教育逐步开展
    设立业余学校八所   
    计划六年内培养万名工人知识分子
    【本报讯】在中共唐山市委宣传部与市总工会的领导下，唐山各规模较大的公私营厂矿，自去年十一月起建立了八所正规化的工人业余补习学校（以下简称工校）。共有学员三千七百二十人。各校学员学习进步很快。如唐山铁路工厂工校初小一年级学员，原为文盲，经三个月学习后，已认识了三百多个字，学会了加减法和三位数字的乘法。预计六年之内，可使入学文盲工人的文化程度提高到初中毕业水平。
    唐山市解放后，各厂矿工会都在工人中广泛进行了初期的政治教育，并部分地设立了一些文化学习组织。市委与市总工会为满足广大工人要求，继续有计划、有系统地提高工人政治、文化和技术水平，乃决定举办大规模的正规化的工人业余补习学校。首先在铁路工厂、华新纺织厂等处开办。计划逐步推广，在六年内培养出一万名工人知识分子。为了集中领导全市的工人教育，市总工会文教部、市委宣传部、市教育局和一部分厂矿的工校负责干部，组成了市工人教育委员会。统一规定了工校的教育方针、学制和教材，制订了教育计划。确定在规模较大的公私营厂矿单独设立工校，小厂联合举办工校。工校经费由工会文教费内开支。每一工校设校长和教务主任各一人，由该厂矿的党、政、工负责人兼任；另设副校长和副教务主任，由专任教员兼任。各工校曾由市总工会统一招聘了四十三名专任教员。经验证明，聘用专任教员是办好工人学校的重要因素。如华新纺织厂与铁路工厂过去办的工人学习班的教员多是兼任。因为他们工作忙，没有充分时间准备教课，又时常缺席，影响了工人的学习情绪。而且兼职教员只能在晚间上课，因此夜班工人无法参加学习。自从有了专任教员以后，这些困难都解决了。教员有充裕时间准备功课和修改学员作业；上课时间分昼夜两班，进度相同，工人昼夜换班后仍可照常学习。专任教员还可深入车间辅导工人学习，大大提高了工人的学习效果。但目前工会文教费有限，还不能在全部工校都设专任教员。补救的办法是在聘请兼任教员时慎择人选，要求其能有准备地按时上课，因故缺席时必须请假并预先请好代课人。
    工校的学制，分初中、高小、初小三部，各设三个年级。初、高小各一年半毕业，初中三年毕业。各校按工人现在文化程度，经过测验分班。目前多数工校都只有初小、高小两部。仅铁路工厂工校增设了中学部，华新纺织厂工校设立了中学预备班。最近开滦唐山煤矿亦在筹备成立中学部。为了照顾学员各科程度的不平衡，各工校采取了混合上课制，如有的学员学习国文在初小三年级，而算术则在二年级。
    工校小学课程以国文、算术为主。初小毕业后要求国文程度达到能读报并可以运用简单文字表达自己的思想；算术学会整数、小数四则运算法。高小毕业则要求：能写通顺的稿件，学会分数、百分数、比例的运算法并能作简易统计图表；此外，学完高小自然，地理和初步的政治理论。初中要求达到相当于普通初级职业技术学校的水平。根据三个月来的上课情形，这些要求是完全可以实现的。因为一般工人都有丰富的生活经验和生产知识，理解力很强。有的工人虽然不识字，但可以说出一篇很动听的演讲词；虽然不认识亚拉伯字，也可作简单的计算。而且他们都有很高的学习热情。
    各工校一般计划每半年授课二十四周。每周上课五天，每天上课两小时；每周留两天作为工人处理家务或党、政、工、团开会的时间，这样可以使大家安心学习。
    各厂矿行政上对工人学习中的各种困难，已作了适当解决。如华新纺织厂工校，很多学员离家很远，黑夜来往不便。该厂特修了两处可容工人四百多人的宿舍，同时，工会与合作社食堂商定，增办粗粮伙食，解决了学习工人的食宿问题。
