    "A Crucial Move"
    Yan Ling
    The forces of Asian countries striving for national independence and people's liberation are so closely united, and the Soviet Union's policy of defending world and Far Eastern peace is so widely understood by the people of Asian countries. The power of these awakened people is so great that the American imperialists know that if they cannot divide the friendly relations between the peoples of Asian countries and between them and the Soviet Union, their plot to invade Asia and use Southeast Asia as a base for aggressive war will be fundamentally impossible to realize. Therefore, as revealed by the Associated Press dispatch on the 17th, the United States will intensify its efforts to alienate the Soviet Union from China and other Asian peoples. This is "a crucial move recommended by Jessup, an ambassador-at-large sent by Acheson and Truman to inspect the diplomatic situation, and his colleagues."
    How much of a role will this "crucial move" play? The people of Asia are able to give the American imperialists a clear answer. The people of Asia will now first see the determination and strength of the Soviet Union and New China to defend peace in the Far East from the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, and further strengthen their friendship with the Soviet Union and New China. While officials in the US embassies in Southeast Asia responsible for propaganda are still planning "how to break the misconceptions and misunderstandings of Americans in Asian countries," the work being carried out by officials responsible for other affairs is bound to leave these "propaganda officials" in a difficult position, unable to sell their plans. People can see clearly who is bringing arms to the reactionaries of Asian countries to suppress the people, who is releasing and sheltering Japanese war criminals, and whose planes and bombs have killed thousands upon thousands of people in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. This will only further strengthen the Chinese people's boundless hatred for American imperialism and its running dogs, and this blood debt will soon be demanded.
    This "move" indeed "crucially" exposes the hideous face and desperate struggle of the American imperialists.

### “重要一着”

　　“重要一着”
    燕凌
    亚洲各国争取民族独立、人民解放的力量是如此紧密地团结，苏联保卫世界与远东和平的政策是为亚洲各国人民如此广泛地了解，这觉醒了的人民的力量是如此巨大，使美帝国主义者知道，它如果分割不了亚洲各国人民间其及与苏联之间的友谊关系，它侵略亚洲和以东南亚为侵略战争基地的阴谋就根本无法实现。所以，如合众社十七日电所透露的，美国将加紧努力离间苏联与中国及其他亚洲人民，这是“艾奇逊与杜鲁门派去视察外交情势的无任所大使耶塞普及其同僚所建议的重要一着”。
    这“重要一着”会起多大作用呢？亚洲人民是能够给美国帝国主义一个清楚的答复的。亚洲人民现在首先会从中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定中看到苏联和新中国保卫远东和平的决心与力量，而更加加强他们与苏联和新中国的友谊。美国驻东南亚各使馆负责宣传的官员还在计议“如何打破亚洲各国对美国人的谬见与误解”，而负责另外的事务的官员正在进行的工作却必然地使这些“宣传官员”们狼狈不堪，无从售其计。人们都看得清清楚楚，是谁在把军火带给亚洲各国反动派去镇压人民，是谁释放与庇护了日本战犯，是谁的飞机和炸弹杀死了上海、南京、杭州成千成百的人民。这只有更增强中国人民对美帝国主义及其走狗的无边仇恨，而且很快就要索回这一笔血债的。
    这“一着”确实“重要”地暴露了美帝国主义者狰狞的面孔和绝望的挣扎。
