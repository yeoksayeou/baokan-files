Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th: The Central South Military and Political Committee held its fourth administrative meeting on the 18th. Those present included Vice Chairmen Deng Zihui and Zhang Nanxian, as well as responsible leaders from various committees, departments, bureaus, and banks, totaling twenty-nine people. The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Deng. First, they listened to a work report from Chen Manyuan, Vice Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, on the province's work in suppressing bandits, collecting grain, spring plowing and overcoming famine, and training cadres in the three months since liberation. This was followed by a report from Vice Chairman Zhang Nanxian on the work progress of the Central South Region's Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Committee since its establishment. Next, the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee reported on the disaster relief work of governments at all levels in the Central South Region over the past six months, stating: Based on the spirit of the instructions from the State Council of the Central People's Government, various places in the Central South actively organized grain and seed loans, distributed relief grain, and organized disaster victims to use labor as relief, carrying out disaster relief measures such as damming breaches, repairing dikes, and draining water, successfully overcoming the winter famine. At present, the spring famine in the Central South Region is still quite serious. According to incomplete statistics, the affected areas include 171 counties, with a disaster-stricken population of over 10 million. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to continue to implement the various instructions of the State Council and the Central South Military and Political Committee regarding disaster relief work, lead the masses to resolutely overcome the spring famine, and prevent the summer famine, so as not to affect the entire financial and economic construction and social order. In his speech, Vice Chairman Deng Zihui clearly pointed out: The disaster relief policy is to mobilize the masses to produce for self-relief, with the main methods being to implement rent reduction, clear up the accumulated grain in community granaries, appropriately adjust the burden of public grain, systematically organize farmers to repair dikes and transport grain, implement labor as relief, and launch social mutual assistance and a thrift and disaster relief movement. Emergency relief will be implemented in areas with severe disasters. Finally, the meeting listened to a detailed report from the person in charge of the Heavy Industry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee on the emergency handling of the accident at the Yiluo Coal Mine.

    【新华社汉口二十日电】中南军政委员会于十八日举行第四次行政会议。出席副主席邓子恢、张难先及各委、部、署、局、行负责首长共二十九人。会议由邓副主席主持，首先听取了广西省人民政府副主席陈漫远关于该省解放后三个月来剿匪、征粮、春耕渡荒、培养干部等方面的工作报告，以及张难先副主席关于中南区禁烟禁毒委员会成立以来工作经过的报告。会议继由中南军政委员会民政部负责人报告半年来中南区各级人民政府的救灾工作称：中南各地曾根据中央人民政府政务院的指示精神，积极举办贷粮贷种，发放救济粮，并组织各地灾民，以工代赈，进行堵口、修堤、排水等救灾措施，胜利地渡过了冬荒。目前中南区春荒仍相当严重，据不完全统计，受灾区域计一百七十一县，受灾区人口约在一千余万以上。因此今后必须继续贯彻政务院、中南军政委员会有关救灾工作的各项指示，领导群众坚决战胜春荒，防止夏荒，以免影响整个财政经济建设和社会秩序。邓子恢副主席在发言中明确指出：救灾方针为发动群众生产自救，主要办法为实行减租、清理义仓积谷、适当调整公粮负担，有计划地组织农民修堤运粮、实行以工代赈，并发动社会互助和节约救灾运动。在灾情严重地区则实行紧急救济。最后，会议听取了中南军政委员会重工业部负责人关于紧急处理宜洛煤矿发生事故的详细报告。
