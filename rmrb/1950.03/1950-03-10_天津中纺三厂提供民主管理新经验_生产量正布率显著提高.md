Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th: According to the Workers' Daily here, the Tianjin Textile Company's No. 3 Mill has provided valuable experience in how to properly implement democratic management. Over the past year, the mill has gradually improved and enriched the organization and work of the Factory Management Committee, making it a truly effective body for centralizing the opinions of the workers and solving major problems in the factory. The Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill has established two sessions of the Factory Management Committee in the past year. The first session of the Factory Management Committee was established on April 25th of last year. Prior to this, the factory had successively handled the corruption of personnel from the puppet trade union and cooperative, reformed and adjusted the old personnel structure, and established the Workers' Representative Assembly and the Trade Union Preparatory Committee, initially raising the workers' level of awareness and laying a certain foundation for the establishment of the Factory Management Committee. However, due to the lack of experience of the leading cadres of the factory takeover team at the time, and the administrative side's insufficient understanding of the policy of relying on the working class to run the factory and the importance of the Factory Management Committee, the first session of the Management Committee was not sound enough. When electing members of the Management Committee, in-depth and universal publicity and explanation work was not carried out, and most of the representatives elected were small workers without technical skills; some were afraid to speak at the meetings for fear of taking responsibility; others raised many trivial issues. The administrative side did not seriously implement some of the resolutions of the Management Committee, and there was insufficient coordination with the trade union in some work. Despite this, the first session of the Management Committee still did a lot of important work, such as running training classes, rotating and training more than 600 workers; organizing more than 200 inspection-free groups through the trade union, abolishing the humiliating body search system for workers; promoting the old technician Yu Shihui to be the foreman of the steel wire maintenance department, and improving the production of the department, etc. During this period, the workers demonstrated their initiative in production, the staff received education on opposing bureaucracy and following the mass line in their work, and the administrative side's idea of not believing in the power of the workers also underwent great changes. All of these laid a considerable foundation for the work of the second session of the Management Committee.

　　　　Established a sound Management Committee, concentrating many rationalization proposals.

The second session of the Management Committee was established in early September last year. Having learned from the lessons of the previous session, experienced and skilled veteran workers and loyal and capable workers were elected as members of the Management Committee through a prepared and well-considered general election. As a result, the prestige of the Management Committee among the workers greatly increased, and the workers' enthusiasm for improving production management also greatly increased. In the twelve meetings held after the establishment of the second session of the Management Committee, the most outstanding work was the concentration of 130 rationalization proposals put forward by the workers, which were studied by engineering personnel and designated as formal working methods. In the nine meetings of the Management Committee from September to December last year, a total of 99 proposals were discussed, including 63 relating to factory management and technical improvement, and 13 relating to workers' welfare. Only four proposals were rejected, three of which were rejected after discussion at the meeting, and one of which was withdrawn by the proposer. The factory director reached a consensus with the other members of the Management Committee and did not use the veto power vested in him by the factory director responsibility system at all.

The factory's Management Committee has established a set of working systems and methods. When the Management Committee holds a meeting, the factory director serves as chairman, first reporting on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting and new instructions from higher authorities, and then discussing the proposals. Each meeting of the Management Committee is well prepared. Before the Management Committee meeting, the members regularly submit the collected proposals to the Secretary of the Management Committee, who organizes and distributes them to the members, and then solicits opinions from the workers, so that the discussion of each proposal by the Management Committee can be fully prepared. Because the preparation is more adequate, the discussion is also more in-depth. Each resolution of the Management Committee is announced to the entire factory as an administrative order, and is also communicated to the workers by the trade union system. The Standing Committee of the Management Committee is composed of the administrative, CCP branch, and trade union leaders who participate in the Management Committee, and meets once a day to exchange information on the production situation and work pace in each workshop in a timely manner and to resolve temporary problems.

The establishment of regular workshop review meetings and workers' representative meetings is an important organizational form of democratic management.

In addition to the Management Committee, the factory has also established regular workshop review meetings and workers' representative meetings, both of which are important organizational forms of democratic management. The workshop review meetings are held every two weeks. At the beginning, the main content of the meetings was to raise opinions to the factory leaders, but later it gradually shifted to production meetings, regularly discussing and solving some problems in the workshop production. The factory's workers' representative meeting is held once a month, the main content of which is the trade union's work report, the factory director's report on the production situation, and the arrangement of the next month's work.

The effect of democratic management on improving production is extremely significant. Taking the cloth factory as an example, during the Kuomintang rule, each machine produced about 43 yards per day, and the first-class cloth rate was at most less than 89 percent; now the average daily output per machine is about 45 yards, with a maximum of nearly 49 yards, and the first-class cloth rate has reached more than 98 percent. From September to December last year, the total value of workers' savings reached more than 280 million yuan. This has greatly reduced the cost of the factory's products.

The main problems existing in the democratic management work of the No. 3 Cotton Mill are: the democratic spirit needs to be further deepened. For example, not enough attention is paid to female workers. Female workers account for 40 percent of the total number of workers in the factory, but there is only one female worker representative in the Management Committee, who was later elected as a replacement. There are not many proposals from female workers, the Management Committee does not solicit opinions from the workers widely enough, and the communication of the Management Committee's resolutions is sometimes too late and not in-depth enough. The workers' representative meeting does not have time to discuss the factory director's report and the trade union's work report. In addition, issues such as planning to cultivate and promote worker cadres, strengthening the unity between workers and staff, and actively running workers' welfare undertakings within the scope of possibility, especially how to rely on the masses of workers to gradually transform the original unreasonable and implement a scientific management production system, remain to be improved by the factory in the future.

　　天津中纺三厂提供民主管理新经验
    生产量正布率显著提高
    【新华社北京九日电】据此间工人日报载，天津中纺公司第三厂已在如何做好管理民主化工作方面提供了值得重视的经验。该厂近一年来逐渐健全和充实了工厂管理委员会的组织和工作，使管委会真正成为有效地集中工人群众意见和解决工厂中重大问题的机构。天津中纺三厂一年以来已成立了两届工厂管理委员会。第一届工厂管委会系于去年四月二十五日成立。在此以前，该厂曾先后进行了处理伪工会和合作社人员的贪污事件，改革和调整了旧的人事机构以及建立职工代表会与工会筹备委员会等工作，初步提高了工人的觉悟程度，给建立工厂管理委员会做了一定程度的准备工作。但是由于当时工厂接管组领导干部缺乏经验，行政方面对依靠工人阶级办工厂的方针和工厂管理委员会的重要性认识不足，因此第一届的管委会是不够健全的。选举管委会委员时，没有进行深入普遍的宣传解释工作，选出的代表多系小工，没有技术；有的在会上不敢发言，怕负责；有的则是提了很多琐碎问题。行政方面对管委会的有些决议也不认真实行，在某些工作上也和工会不够协调。尽管这样，第一届管委会仍做了许多重要工作，如举办训练班，轮训了六百多个工人；通过工会组织了二百多个免检小组，废除侮辱工人的搜身制度；提拔了老技工于世惠做钢丝保全部领班，改进了该部的生产等。在这期间，工人在生产中表现了自己的积极性，职员在工作中又受到了反对官僚主义作风和走群众路线的教育，行政方面不大相信工人力量的思想也有了很大的转变。这些都给第二届管理委员会的工作打下了相当的基础。
            成立了健全的管委会，集中了很多合理化建议。
    第二届的管委会于去年九月初成立。由于接受了上届的教训，经过有准备有酝酿的普选，有经验有技术的老工人和忠实、有能力的工人被选为管委会委员。因此，管委会在工人中的威信大为提高，工人对改进生产管理的积极性亦大增。在第二届管委会成立后的十二次会议中，最突出的工作是集中了工人提出的合理化建议一百三十件，并经过工程人员研究，把这些建议规定为正式的工作法。在去年九月到十二月的九次管理委员会会议中，共讨论了九十九件提案，其中有关工厂管理和技术改进的六十三件，关于工人福利的十三件。被否决的提案仅有四件，其中三件是会议讨论后否决，一件是提案人撤消了原议。厂长都和管委会其他委员取得了一致的意见，完全没有使用厂长负责制中所赋予的否决权。
    该厂管委会已建立了一套工作制度和方法。管委会举行会议时，厂长任主席，首先由厂长报告上次会议决议的执行情况和上级新的指示，然后讨论议案。每次管委会的召开是经过很好的准备。在管委会开会以前，各委员定期将搜集的提案交给管委会秘书，由其整理后分发各委员，然后再到工人中征求意见，使管委会对各项提案的讨论能经过充分的准备。由于准备较充分，讨论亦较深刻。管委会的每次决议，一方面作为行政命令公布全厂，一方面由工会系统向工人传达。管委会的常委会由参加管委会的行政、中共支部与工会的负责人组成，每天接头一次，及时交换各车间生产情况和工作步调以及解决临时性的问题。
    建立了定期的车间检讨会议和职工代表会议，这是管理民主化的重要组织形式。
    除了管委会外，该厂还建立了定期的车间检讨会议和职工代表会议，这两种会议都是工厂管理民主化的重要组织形式。车间检讨会议每两周举行一次，开始时会议的主要内容是向工厂领导上提意见，以后已逐渐转为生产会议，定期讨论解决车间生产中的一些问题。该厂的职工代表会议是每月举行一次，主要内容是工会报告工作，厂长报告生产情况，布置下月工作。
    管理民主化对于改进生产的效果是极显著的。以布厂为例，国民党统治时每机每日生产四十三码左右，正布率最多不到百分之八十九；现在每机每日平均产量为四十五码左右，最高有近四十九码的，正布率则达到百分之九十八以上。去年九月到十二月工人节约总值达二亿八千多万元。这就使该厂产品成本大大减低。
    中纺三厂管理民主化工作中目前存在的问题主要是：民主精神还待进一步深入贯彻。如对女工注意即很不够。全厂工人中女工占百分之四十，管委会中只有一个女工代表，还是后来补选的，女工的提案也不多，管委会征求工人意见也不够广泛，管委会决议的传达也有过迟和不深入的现象。职工代表会议没有时间讨论厂长报告和工会工作报告。此外，有计划地培养提拔工人干部、加强工人职员间的团结以及在可能范围内主动地办好工人福利事业等问题，特别是如何依靠工人群众逐渐地改造原来的不合理的和实行科学的管理生产制度问题，尚有待于该厂在今后努力改进。
