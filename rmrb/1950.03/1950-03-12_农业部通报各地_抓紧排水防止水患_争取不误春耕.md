Ministry of Agriculture Issues Circular to All Regions
　　Hasten Drainage to Prevent Floods and Strive Not to Delay Spring Planting
　　[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued the fourth "Agricultural Situation Circular" on the 10th, requiring all regions to hasten drainage and be vigilant against floods. The circular stated: In the Suxian sub-district of northern Anhui province in the East China region, from January 27th to February 14th, continuous rain and snow caused the water levels of various rivers to rise sharply. Due to a lack of preparedness, 120,000 mu of wheat fields were flooded. The masses are currently being organized to dig ditches for drainage, as well as organize sideline production to carry out disaster relief work. Due to the heavy rain and snow last year in various regions, a large amount of rainwater was sealed in the ground after freezing. Now it has begun to thaw. If inspection and prevention are not carried out in a timely manner, major rivers may experience sudden rises in water levels, causing floods. In areas with accumulated water, local governments should hasten drainage work to strive not to delay spring planting.

    抓紧排水防止水患  争取不误春耕
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部于十日发出第四号“农情通报”，要求各地抓紧排水，谨防水患。通报称：华东区皖北宿县分区，自一月二十七日至二月十四日，不断雨雪，各河水位猛涨，未及防范，淹没麦地十二万亩。现正组织群众，挖沟排水，并组织副业生产，开展救灾工作。各地区由于去年雨雪甚多，结冻后有多量雨水封存地内，现已开始解冻，如不及时检查防范，各大河可能引起水位暴涨，发生水灾。在有积水的地区，当地政府应抓紧排水工作，争取不误春耕。
