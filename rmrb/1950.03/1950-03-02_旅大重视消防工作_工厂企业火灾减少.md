Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: Lüda reports: Compared to 1948, Lüda's factories and enterprises made significant progress in fire prevention in 1949. Last year, there were 28 fires in factories and enterprises in the Lüda area, a decrease of 43.7% in number and 92% in value of losses compared to 1948. The reasons for this progress are: First, the higher leading organs attached importance to fire prevention work in enterprises and factories, and organized two fire prevention inspections of various enterprises and factories throughout the year. Through the inspections, they corrected the侥幸 (jiǎoxìng - lucky) mentality and麻痹 (mábì - numb) ideology of some cadres, and supplemented the fire prevention equipment in various factories and enterprises. Second, fire prevention organizations were strengthened within each enterprise and factory, safety committees were established, and off-production self-defense fire brigades, as well as on-production voluntary firefighters and workshop fire prevention groups, were set up; some factories also established inspection, night duty, and patrol systems. Third, mass fire prevention education was conducted by using spare time and various meeting times to enable workers and staff to understand fire prevention and firefighting knowledge. During the winter fire prevention period, fire prevention knowledge was printed into cartoons and slogans and distributed to various occasions in enterprises and factories, and newspapers and radio stations were used to widely publicize the key points of winter fire prevention. Fourth, the Public Security Bureau regularly dispatched firefighters to major factories to strengthen the education of self-defense fire brigades, and ran training courses to cultivate fire prevention cadres for various enterprises and factories.

　　旅大重视消防工作  工厂企业火灾减少
    【新华社北京二十六日电】旅大讯：与一九四八年比较，旅大工厂企业一九四九年的消防工作有了显著的进步。去年旅大区工厂企业中发生的火灾有二十八次，比一九四八年在次数上减少百分之四三·七，在损失价值上则减少百分之九二。这种进步的原因是：一、高级领导机关重视企业工厂中的防火工作，一年中曾组织了两次对各企业工厂中的防火检查，通过检查纠正了部分干部的侥幸心理与麻痹思想，并充实了各工厂企业中的防火设备。二、在各企业工厂内部加强防火组织，建立安全委员会，设有脱离生产的自卫消防班，以及不脱离生产的义务消防员和车间消防小组；有的工厂里还建立了检查、夜间值班与巡逻等制度。三、利用业余和各种会议时间，进行群众性的防火教育，使工人、职员懂得防火常识与消防常识。在冬防期间，又将防火常识印制成漫画、标语，散发到企业工厂的各个场合，并利用报纸和广播电台，广泛地宣传冬防要点。四、公安局经常抽调消防队员到各主要工厂，加强对自卫消防班的教育，并开办训练班，给各企业工厂培养消防干部。
