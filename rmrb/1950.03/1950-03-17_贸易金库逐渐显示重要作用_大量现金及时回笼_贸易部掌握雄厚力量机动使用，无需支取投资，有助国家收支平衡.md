Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Since the establishment of the Trade Treasury, its important role in the national financial economy has gradually become apparent within ten days; at the same time, the shortcomings that were expected to occur have indeed occurred and need to be gradually improved. After the establishment of trade treasuries in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Changsha, Kaifeng and other places on the 7th, as of the 14th, the remaining cash in the treasury, in addition to the cash successively allocated by the Ministry of Trade, was 190 billion yuan, of which 50 billion yuan had been turned over to the state treasury by the Ministry of Trade to perform the task of withdrawing currency from circulation.

One of the increasingly significant achievements of the central government is that the Ministry of Trade of the People's Government can at any time understand and grasp the cash strength of its subordinates and use it flexibly. In the past ten days, the allocated cash has been concentrated on the operation of grain and cotton yarn, because according to the overall assessment, the needs in these two areas are more urgent. In the past, these cash were scattered and preserved in the hands of various regional and professional companies, with both regional and professional distinctions, making such flexible allocation impossible.

Overcoming the Blindness of Cash Input into the Market, Promoting Careful Planning by Various Professional Companies

At that time, in order to cope with the relatively urgent needs in grain and cotton yarn as at present, the Ministry of Trade could only overdraw from the bank, which would inevitably increase the issuance of currency. Moreover, when various companies freely put these cash into the market, they often brought great blindness, disrupting their own ranks. Now, this blindness and chaos have been guaranteed to be overcome due to the establishment of the treasury.

Judging from the situation in the past ten days, since the cash of various regions and companies is turned over to the treasury at any time, the Ministry of Trade can temporarily not withdraw investment from the Ministry of Finance this month, and can still carry out work smoothly, and can timely perform the financial task of withdrawing currency from circulation. Originally, according to the original plan before the National Financial Conference last month, the Ministry of Trade could withdraw an investment from the Ministry of Finance in March, the amount of which was equivalent to 200 million catties of millet. Later, the National Financial Conference decided to temporarily stop the allocation of this fund to tighten state treasury expenditures. It can be seen that the trade treasury system has a very important significance for balancing national income and expenditure.

Another achievement is that this trade treasury system has prompted various professional companies to re-examine their original business plans and financial plans, making these plans more accurate and practical. In the past, they each controlled cash and could freely circulate it, so they were often not very thorough when formulating plans.

Various Regions are Still Not Paying Enough Attention to Expanding Sales Volume and Accelerating Cash Recovery

At the same time, some shortcomings have also been discovered. One of the shortcomings that has already emerged is that some units tend to expand their own needs for cash and reduce the number of withdrawals when re-ordering their plans, in order to reserve room for maneuver. For example, the cash required by the North China Fur Company's revised plan is more than 260% larger than the original plan. Various regions and companies are very active in urging the higher authorities to allocate cash as soon as possible; but the figures they handed over to the treasury are not large enough, and some are even very small, which shows that they are not paying enough attention to the responsibility of expanding the sales volume of goods to accelerate cash recovery. The persons in charge of these companies do not understand that if various regions and companies do not actively recover cash and expand the number of deposits into the treasury, the central Ministry of Trade will not have sufficient cash to allocate in a timely manner. Therefore, strict inspection and strengthening unified concepts are very important for the working cadres of various trade organs.

Another shortcoming is that the procedures for reporting by banks at all levels in various regions are relatively slow, which affects the Ministry of Trade's ability to use these deposited cash in a timely manner, affecting the turnover of funds. In addition, the bank's daily business hours are short, and it is completely closed on Sundays, which prevents some cash from being deposited into the treasury in a timely manner. This problem needs to be studied jointly by the Ministry of Trade and the People's Bank of China in order to find a solution.

### 贸易金库逐渐显示重要作用  大量现金及时回笼  贸易部掌握雄厚力量机动使用，无需支取投资，有助国家收支平衡

　　贸易金库逐渐显示重要作用
    大量现金及时回笼
    贸易部掌握雄厚力量机动使用，无需支取投资，有助国家收支平衡
    【新华社十六日讯】贸易金库开始建立以来，十天之内，对国家财政经济的重要作用已逐渐显示；同时事先预料可能发生的缺点也确已随之发生，有待逐步加以改进。北京、天津、上海、汉口、保定、石家庄、唐山、张家口、济南、长沙、开封等地贸易金库于七日开始先后建立后，截至十四日止，入库现金除由贸易部陆续拨出者以外，尚剩余现金一千九百亿元，其中五百亿元已由贸易部解缴国库，执行回笼任务。
    中央日渐显著的成果之一，是人民政府贸易部能够随时了解和掌握所属的现金力量，而予以机动使用。十天来拨出的现金，集中使用在粮食与花纱布的经营上，因为根据全局的衡量，这两方面的需要较为迫切。而在过去，这些现金是分散保存在各个地区各个专业公司手中，既有地区之别，又有专业之分，不可能这样灵活调度。
  克服现金投入市场盲目性，促使各专业公司周密计划
    那时为了应付像目前粮食与花纱布方面这样比较迫切的需要，贸易部就只能向银行透支，因此势必增加货币的发行。而且当各公司把这些现金自由地投入市场的时候，往往带着很大的盲目性，以自乱阵营。致现在，这种盲目性和混乱现象，由于金库的建立，已获得了克服的保证。
    照这十天的情形看，由于各地各公司的现金随时入库上缴，本月份内贸易部可以暂时无需向财政部支取投资，仍能顺利进行工作，并且能够及时执行回笼货币的财政任务。本来，按照上月全国财政会议以前原定的计划，三月份内贸易部可向财政部支取一笔投资，其数额金折合小米达二亿斤之巨。后来，全国财政会议决定这笔资金暂时停止拨付，以紧缩国库支出。由此可见贸易金库制度对平衡国家收支，确有极为重大的意义。
    另一个成果是这个贸易金库制度促使各专业公司重新审定了自己原来的业务计划和财务计划，使这些计划更加精确和切合实际。因为过去他们各自掌握了现金，可以自由周转，制订计划时就往往很不周密。
    各地对扩大销货量，加速现金回笼，注意仍很不够
    与此同时，若干缺点也发现了。已经显露的缺点之一是有些单位在重订他们的计划时，往往扩大自己对现金的需要而缩小回笼的数字，以预留机动的余地。如华北皮毛公司重订的计划所需的现金，比原定的计划扩大了百分之二百六十以上。各地各公司对催促上级火速拨付现金一事十分积极；而他们自己交入金库的数字却不够大，有的甚至交得非常少，这说明他们对扩大货物的销售数量以加速现金回笼的责任，注意得很不够。这些公司的负责人不了解：如果各地区各公司不积极回笼现金，扩大入库上缴的数量，中央贸易部就不可能有充分的现金及时下拨。因之，严格检查和加强统一观念，对各贸易机关工作干部来说是很重要的。
    另一个缺点是各地若干银行逐级上报的手续较为迟缓，影响贸易部不能及时使用这些入库的现金，影响资金的周转。此外，银行每天营业时间较短，星期日更是完全不营业的，致使有些现金不能及时入库。这个问题有待于贸易部与人民银行共同研究，以求得解决。
