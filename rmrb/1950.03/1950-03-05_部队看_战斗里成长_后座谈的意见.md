　　Opinions from Troops on "Growing Up in Battle" After Seeing the Play
		I. Aviation Department
	Zhou Ping (Propaganda and Education Section Chief): The play was very effective and of great educational significance to the troops. Everyone was very satisfied after seeing it. The soldiers' meetings, the cook's expressions, and the relationships between officers and soldiers were all very realistic. It touched on many issues - regularization, discipline, class friendship, always being a fighting force, etc. Therefore, everyone thought it was good after seeing it. However, the idea of always being a fighting force was not developed enough. In my opinion, it seems to focus on class hatred, three generations of hatred, leading to fighting for the revolution. The theme is not profound enough. In the dialogue between the battalion commander and the political instructor, it was not explained why he didn't miss his wife. The emotions during the meeting between the couple were not so straightforward. The conversation between the couple lacked emotional expression. It seems like the woman was very progressive, which might not be realistic. It would be better if the woman was reluctant and the man persuaded her.
	Lu Qian: This play showed how the struggle arose and what goals it wanted to achieve. Watching this play increased the audience's class hatred, and they felt that not fighting was not an option. It felt oppressive at the beginning, but relaxed later. There was the idea of always being a fighting force, and the spirit of liberating the whole country. The portrayal of the soldiers' lives was particularly rich: the relationship between soldiers and leaders, the soldiers' straightforwardness, that's how the front-line troops are. Stone's writing was good. The father's criticism of his son in the third act was very touching, it didn't feel like watching a play, it was life. As for the actors, the battalion commander played well, he had the flavor of a peasant when he was a peasant, and the flavor of a cadre when he was a cadre. The battalion commander's wife played well, when she was fighting the traitor, she couldn't bring herself to hit him, and the audience was cheering her on, it was very lifelike. Shortcomings: Before the old man ate the alum, it was too bland, the ideological struggle was not strong, so the audience wasn't too impressed by his death. The old man's movements were too fast, sometimes not like an old man's movements. The mother of Black Egg should have had older makeup at the end, more yellow and thin to show the oppression she suffered for thirteen years. The sets and lighting were good, but some soldiers' necks were not made up, red face, white neck. The red and white flags for communication should not be covering Sihai's face. It's hard to command with those things in the way.
	Comrade A: The most successful performance was the three children, the character development was consistent from the second act to the third. Also the battalion commander was good. The old man was strong, but his attitude didn't have to be so hard. He should have struggled more when he died. There wasn't much crying after he died, people in the countryside cry a lot when someone dies.
	Comrade B: We watched this play with full attention, without getting tired. Class hatred was deeply understood by everyone. Stone's mother didn't hit the landlord because she was too heartbroken, in fact, it would be better if she had hit him. Shortcomings: The battalion commander wasn't afraid of the landlord at all before joining the army, which is not very realistic, he should have begged a little, and only set the fire when that didn't work, the impression would be more profound. Stone's request to be in the assault team emphasized revenge for his mother, it seemed overemphasized. The cook's request to go to the battlefield was a good starting point, but it was also good that the battalion commander didn't let him go, the battalion commander should have explained it to the cook in detail.
	Comrade C: Felt it was even more exciting than watching a movie. On the way back, everyone was talking about the play, it was very effective in inspiring class hatred, and suitable for our current ideological situation. It was educational for cadres with personal and family problems. It showed the education of battlefield discipline and prisoner discipline to new comrades, and Sihai handing over his party membership fee before being wounded and killed was very educational for backward party members. Shortcomings: The old man's death by eating alum was not well portrayed, the content should have been reported to the audience beforehand. The party's cultivation was not clearly expressed, and the political instructor's work was not shown enough.
	Comrade D: Zhao Stone running to become an assault team member, and the signaler shouting after him, could easily expose the target. It wasn't clear how Sihai got shot. After eating, there should have been an inspection of one's own equipment. After the assault team took the enemy's position, they should have dispersed their forces, not crowded together. The political instructor should have learned about Zhao Stone after he joined the army. There should have been a battle mobilization before the battle. The battalion commander's makeup was too young, because ten years had passed.
	Comrade E: Stone should lead everyone in the assault, not take care of the wounded.
		II. Guard Battalion (Battalion Headquarters)
	Comrade A: This play is very suitable for combat troops to watch, it has great educational significance. Like "Have you taken revenge?" "Yes - no, Sihai's revenge has not been taken!" The meaning refers to the revenge of the broad masses of the people has not been taken. In battle, passing by one's own home and not being able to go back for a reunion, such things happen, so that the audience can learn from the people in the play. The final continued battle, the mother and son still can't reunite, that meaning is great, the soldiers are moved (for the liberation of the people). After watching this play, confidence in work was established, and morale was improved.
	Comrade B: After watching it, I felt that dying by poisoning was not good, it seemed too cowardly. The final capture of the landlord did not show the power of the masses, the masses should have given a denunciation speech before sending him away.
	Battalion Commander Feng: This play has a very clear class viewpoint and is of deep educational significance to the troops. The villainous landlord forcing the couple to separate was very touching. The hatred for the Yang family (landlord) was expressed in the struggle, the masses' hatred for Yang Mazi was fierce, but the hatred for Yan Xishan was not obvious. The entire enemy's oppression of the people was not expressed enough; it seemed like it was just Yang Mazi alone, not the entire old society. After Zhao ran away, Zhao's wife and son escaped from the village, their suffering in the following ten years should have been described, to further increase the hatred. After liberation, a scene should be added to show the comfort received by the family, to show how glorious the military family is, this is what the soldiers are most concerned about. It's not enough to just say the military family is glorious, how is it glorious? (Like the play "Great Celebration," it has a very good impact on the troops)
	Political Commissar Li: The old man should not have died by eating alum. According to the old man's strong personality, he should have resisted, then suffered some torture (such as scolding the landlord and being beaten), been injured, plus resentment, then dying would be better. Stone was chattering when the squad meeting was being held, it seemed a bit unserious. It is possible for the company's signaler to be playful, but the battalion headquarters signaler should not stay in the squad for so long; also, Stone had only joined recently, he wouldn't be so familiar with everyone. We didn't see our civilian porters on the battlefield, they should have appeared to show how much the people hate the enemy and how much they support us.
	Comrade C: Add a scene at the end showing the masses' enthusiasm and support for the father and son after the battle. The old landlord should be put in the puppet regime, as some kind of person in charge.
	Comrade D: It was so coincidental that the kid ran into his father, but how did he not know it was his kid when they met? Some comrades felt it was a bit mysterious. The time was too rushed, that is also possible. The father and son both have a "reckless" energy, which does make them seem like father and son.
		III. Guard Battalion (Third Company)
	Deputy Company Commander: After Zhao Gang ran away, how did Yang Mazi force his wife and son to leave? It wasn't shown. It had no beginning. How did he occupy his land? The process of the lawsuit should be made clear to the audience. Who handled the lawsuit? How was the judgment made? How did Tie Zhu end up in the coal mine before joining the army? After Black Egg joined, there was no reflection on him being wounded in that battle, how he stayed in the hospital? Some people thought he was a new recruit.
	Soldier: If you watch this play many times, you can understand it clearly, but if you only watch it once, some places are confusing and you can't see the beginning and end. I really want to watch it in detail stage by stage. The plot should be reported before the opening.
	Soldier: It should show the close relationship between the people and the army after liberation, and the joy after fighting Yang Mazi. At the end, only the soldiers are singing, should the villagers also sing a section, and close in a very tense atmosphere.
	Soldier: The actors are very skilled, the actress playing the wife and the actor playing the old man are very skilled, Stone and Black Egg also played well, Stone's three stages were well portrayed.
	Instructor: The play is good, it suits the soldiers' tastes, the actors' skills are also good, and the sets are good too (like the environment of Taiyuan). After becoming a battalion commander, his attitude, every move, was very straightforward and direct. What I'm not satisfied with is that there was no struggle against Yang Mazi afterwards. It would be good to add a scene of the mother and son suffering, but that would make the scenes too chaotic, so it's better not to add it. It's not necessary to add several scenes about Tie Zhu's history, it would be too chaotic, but when the political instructor asks him, he should talk in more detail, because he is a main character, and the audience wants to know more about him.
	Soldier: Yang Mazi went to see the old man while he was dying, I think that since he ate alum to die, he didn't need to say so much to the landlord, the landlord could have said more.
	Soldier: Stone wanted to be in the assault team, the battalion commander didn't answer, he was unhappy, then he let him go, and he smiled, that was needed, but I felt that smiling too much was unnatural.

### 部队看“战斗里成长”后座谈的意见

　　部队看“战斗里成长”后座谈的意见
            一、航空处
    周平（宣教股长）：这戏演出的效果很好，对部队的教育意义很大，大家看了很满意，战士开会，炊事员的表情，官兵关系都很真实。接触到的问题很多——正规化、纪律、阶级友爱、永远是战斗队等。因之看了以后，觉得好。但永远是战斗队这一思想，觉得发挥得不够，我看来似乎是以阶级仇恨为主题，三代仇恨，引到为革命战斗，主题不够深刻化。营长与教导员对话中未说明为什么不想自己的老婆。夫妻见面时感情上不是那么干脆的，夫妻之间的谈话，感情表现不足，好像女的很进步似的，恐不大现实；如女的留恋，男的说服，会更好。
    陆倩：这戏表现了斗争是怎么引起的，要到达什么目的。看了此戏，增加观众的阶级仇恨，感到不打仗真是不行。前面感到压抑，后来轻松了。有永远是个战斗队的思想，有解放全国的气概。表现战士生活特别丰富：战士与首长的关系，战士的直爽，前方部队就是这样。石头写的好。第三幕父亲批评儿子很动人，不像是看戏，这是生活。演员方面，营长演得好，当农民时有农民味，当干部有干部味。营长妻演得好，在打汉奸时，打不下去，观众替她使劲，很有生活。缺点：老头吃矾以前，太平淡，思想斗争不强，所以他死后，观众印象不太深，老头在动作上太快，有时不像老头的动作了。黑蛋之母最后的化装应当老一些，要黄瘦一些表示受反动的压榨十三年。布景灯光好，化装上有些战士脖子未化装，红脸白脖子。通讯的红白旗不应当蒙在四海脸上。这样指挥起来便没有工具了。
    某同志：演的最成功的是三个小孩，第二个到第三个，性格表现得很一致。再即是营长好。老头刚强，但态度不必太硬。死的时候折腾的应利害些。死后没怎么哭，乡下死了人是哭得很厉害的。
    某同志：我们看这戏精神始终贯注，不厌倦，阶级仇恨让大家领会的很深。石头他娘没有打地主，是因为伤心过度了，其实，打了反而不好。缺点方面：营长参军前对地主毫不畏惧，不太现实，应哀求一下，不行才放火，印象会更深刻。石头要求突击时强调为母亲报仇，似乎强调得过度。炊事员要求上战场，出发点好，营长不叫他上战场也好，营长应详细向炊事员作一解释。
    某同志：觉得比看电影还带劲。回来路上，大家统谈这戏，在启发阶级仇恨上很有作用，适合我们今天思想情况。对闹个人问题，家庭问题的干部有教育。对新同志表现了战场纪律的教育，俘虏纪律的教育，四海受伤阵亡前交党费，对落后党员很有教育。缺点：老头吃矾死，表现不够，事前应把内容给观众报告一下。党的培养表现得不明确，教导员的工作表现得不多。
    某同志：赵石头跑去当突击队，通讯员在后头那么喊，容易暴露目标。四海挂花说得不明显，怎么挂的花呢？吃完饭后出发，应对自己武装进行一个检查。突击班既夺下敌阵地，应分配开兵力，不要太拥挤，要散开。赵石头入伍后，教导员应进行一番了解。战斗前应有一战斗动员。营长的化装太年青了，因为已过了十年了。
    某同志：石头应率领大家进行突击，不能照顾伤号。
            二、警卫营（营部）
    某同志：这戏极适合战斗部队看，教育意义大。如“报仇了没有？”“报了——不，四海的仇还没有报哩！”意思是指广大人民的仇还没有报。战斗中，路过自己家中不能回去团圆，这样事是有的，使观众向剧中人学习。最后的继续战斗，母子又不得团圆，那意义大，战士们感动了（为了解放人民）。看了这戏，树立了工作信心，提高了情绪。
    某同志：我看了以后，感到服毒死不好，好像太窝囊。最后抓住地主没有表现群众的威力，群众应控诉一段再送走才好。
    冯营长：这戏阶级观点很明确，对部队教育意义深。恶霸逼迫得夫妻离别，很感动人。斗争中对杨家（地主）的仇恨是表现出来了，群众对杨麻子仇恨厉害，而对阎锡山的仇恨不明显。整个敌人对人民的压迫，表现得不够；似乎只杨麻子一个人，而不是整个旧社会。赵跑出后，赵妻携子逃出村去，以后的苦处，十年光景，应当描写一下，更增加仇恨。解放后应加一幕戏表现家属得到的安慰，表现军属怎么样光荣，这是战士们最关心的。光说军属光荣，怎么光荣呢？（如大庆功这戏，给部队很好影响）
    李政委：老头不应该吃矾死，按老头个性的刚强，应当反抗，之后，受点苦刑（如骂地主，而遭殴打），受了伤，加上蹩气，这样死就更好些。正开班务会时，石头就喳喳唬唬，略嫌不够严肃。连部的通讯员还有可能去顽皮，营部通讯员去班里时间便不应逗留那么长；再说石头刚参加不久，也不会那么熟悉。战场上看不到咱们的民工担架，应出现一下，表现人民对敌人如何仇恨，对我如何拥护支持。
    某同志：后面增加上在战斗后，群众对他们父子俩的热情、拥护。应把地主老头按在伪政权里，当个什么负责人。
    某同志：他小子跟他父亲碰得那么巧，既碰见了，怎么就不知是他小子？有的同志感到有点玄虚。时间太仓促，也有可能。父子俩都有股子“二杆子”劲，倒是很像父子俩。
            三、警卫营（三连）
    副连长：赵刚跑了以后，杨麻子怎么逼他母子出去？没表现。没有头。不知怎么把他的地霸占了？打官司的经过，应使观众了解。官司是谁处理的？怎么判断的？铁柱参军前，是怎么下的煤窑？黑蛋参加后，没有反映他在那个战斗负伤的，怎么住的院？有人以为他是新入伍的。
    战士：这个戏，如看的次数多，就能明了了，如只看一次，有些地方就闹不清，看不出头绪。很想一个阶段一个阶段的看详细些。开幕之前应报告剧情。
    战士：应表现解放后老百姓与军队的亲密联系，和斗争杨麻子后的快乐。末尾光战士们唱歌，是否也让老乡唱一段，在很紧张中闭幕。
    战士：演员们很熟练，演老婆的与演老头的都很熟练，石头和黑蛋也都演的好，石头的三个阶段表现的好。
    指导员：剧是好的，适合战士口味，演员技术也好，布景也好（如太原的环境）。当了营长之后，态度一举一动，很爽快直接了当。感到不满足的是以后没有斗争杨麻子。如再加上母子受苦一幕当然好，但又使幕太乱了，不如不加。铁柱的历史不必要加几幕戏，加了就乱了，不过教导员问他时，他应当谈得详细一些，因为他是一个主角，观众希望多了解些。
    战士：老头正在死时，杨麻子又去了，我认为既吃矾死，就不必与地主说那么些话，可以让地主多说些话。
    战士：石头想当突击队，营长不答复，不高兴，后来叫他去了，他笑了，是需要的，但我感到笑的太多了就不自然了。
