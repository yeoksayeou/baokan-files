　　Rolling Wheat Fields
　　Jiao Peigui
　　Before the Anti-Japanese War, the work of rolling wheat fields was done in many areas. Later, due to the shortage of manpower and draught animals during the war, some areas gradually stopped. As a result, wheat production was affected. Now that the vast areas of the country have shifted from war to production and construction, with the rising tide of agricultural production increase across the country, the promotion of intensive cultivation, rolling wheat fields should be restored and emphasized.
　　　　　　Benefits of Rolling Wheat Fields
　　1. After the wheat seedlings are rolled, the nodes close to the roots are in close contact with the soil, and new roots can grow on the nodes, strengthening the ability of the wheat roots to absorb nutrients and water, so the wheat seedlings can grow well.
　　2. With more new roots, the roots can be stabilized, and the wheat plants will naturally not easily fall over.
　　3. When the winter climate is warm, the stems and leaves grow too luxuriantly, but the roots are underdeveloped. If they are not rolled and suppressed, the wheat seedlings are likely to wither if they encounter drought in the spring.
　　4. When the ground freezes in winter, the water in the ground freezes and expands, and the wheat seedlings rise with the soil. As a result, the ends of the wheat roots are broken. If they are not rolled in time to fix the roots in the soil and promote growth, the wheat seedlings are likely to wither in the spring.
　　5. Between winter and spring, geese and crows often dig up wheat seedlings in wheat fields, causing great harm. If the wheat field is rolled, the soil surface is firm, and the wheat roots are numerous, so it is not easy for geese and crows to dig them out.
　　6. After rolling, the soil particles are finely crushed, the ground is firm, and the moisture in the soil is easily maintained, which has the effect of enhancing drought prevention. Especially in arid, windy or sandy land, rolling is indispensable.
　　7. After rolling, all the soil clods are crushed, and the ground is flat, which is more convenient for hoeing and harvesting wheat.
　　　　　　Methods and Timing
　　The method of rolling wheat fields is generally to have people or livestock pull a roller (that is, a roller) and roll back and forth in the wheat field in sequence. Ordinary land can be rolled once, and it is better to roll twice if it is sandy soil. Rolling time: If it is done once, it is best to do it after the ground thaws (that is, after the beginning of spring). If it is rolled twice, roll it once when the ground is about to freeze in early winter, and then roll it again after it thaws.
　　The climate has been warm this winter. If rolling is not carried out, spring wheat may not grow well. Farmers in various places should pay more attention and generally carry out rolling.

　　滚压麦田
    焦培桂
    滚压麦田工作，抗战以前，在很多地区都做。后因战争中，人力耕畜不足，有些地区渐渐停止。因而麦产受到影响。现在全国广大地区已由战争转入生产建设环境，在全国农业增产的声浪中，提倡精耕细作，滚压麦田应该恢复与重视的。
            麦田滚压的好处
    一、麦苗经过镇压后，接近根部的节，和土壤密接，节上就可发生新根，加强麦根吸收养分和水分的能力，麦苗生长，自可良好。
    二、新根增多了，根部就可稳固，麦株自然也就不容易倒伏。
    三、冬季气候温暖时，茎叶生长过茂，根部反而发育不良，如不滚压抑制，春季稍遇天旱，麦苗容易枯死。
    四、冬季地冻时，地内水分冻结膨胀，麦苗随土壤高起，因之麦根末端拔断，若不及时滚压，使根部固着土内，增进生长，春季麦苗就容易枯死。
    五、冬春之间，大雁、乌鸦常在麦地刨食麦苗，为害很大。麦田若经滚压，土面紧实，麦根又多，大雁、乌鸦就不容易刨出。
    六、滚压后土粒细碎，地面紧实，土内湿气容易保持，有增强防旱的功效。尤其在干旱多风或砂性土地，滚压工作更不可缺少。
    七、滚压后土坷垃全被压碎，地面平坦，对锄麦割麦工作都较便利。
            方法和时间
    麦田滚压的方法，普通都是人或牲口拉一辊轴（就是滚子），在麦田往返挨次滚压，普通地滚一次就可，若为砂性土，滚两次更好。滚压时间：如举行一次，以地面开冻后（即立春以后）行之最宜。若压两次，在初冬地要冻时，先滚一次，开冻后再滚一次。
    今冬气候温暖，如不举行滚压，春麦子恐怕生长不好。各地农民应多加注意，普遍举行滚压。
