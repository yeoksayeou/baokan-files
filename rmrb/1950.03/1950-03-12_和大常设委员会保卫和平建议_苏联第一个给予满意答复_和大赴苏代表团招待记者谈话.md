　　World Peace Council Standing Committee's Proposal for Peace
    The Soviet Union First to Give Satisfactory Reply
    WPC Delegation to the Soviet Union Holds Press Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th] TASS, Moscow: The World Peace Council Standing Committee delegation to the Soviet Union held a press conference on March 8th, after submitting the peace appeal to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Representatives of the Soviet Peace Committee, representatives of the Soviet press, and foreign journalists attended the press conference.
    In response to a journalist's question about the delegation's impression of the Soviet Union after fulfilling its mission, the head of the delegation, Faccio, said: The Soviet Union is the first country to give a clear answer to the Standing Committee's proposal to defend peace. Faccio pointed out that the delegation had submitted the Standing Committee's appeal to the speakers of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies of Italy and the speaker of the French National Assembly. The delegation had attempted to submit this appeal to the Dutch Parliament, but was deported. In Belgium, the delegation was forced to mail the Standing Committee's appeal to Parliament. As for the United States, the U.S. Embassy in Paris even refused to grant members of the delegation U.S. entry visas. Faccio pointed out with satisfaction that the response of the leaders of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union gave reason to be filled with hope.
    Wen Youzhang's Talk Points Out That American Democracy and Freedom Have Been Eliminated, and Warmongers' Arrogance is High
    Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Committee, mentioned the U.S.'s refusal to grant entry visas to members of the delegation, saying: There is no longer any freedom in North America. In Canada, if peace advocates want to hold a meeting in a certain house, the police have the right to close that house. Wen Youzhang continued: I think we can say correctly and without error that democracy and freedom have been eliminated in the United States, and the warmongers are arrogant. In the United States, the struggle for peace has become a struggle for civil liberties and civil rights.
    Kent, an American artist and member of the delegation, emphasized that he praised the Soviet capital and its clean streets with envy when talking about the warm welcome the delegation received in Moscow.
    Roach, an American member of the delegation, said in response to questions from reporters that his opinions differed in some respects from those of Wen Youzhang and Kent. Roach attempted to gloss over the fact that the United States had launched the so-called "Cold War" and made the United States and the Soviet Union equally responsible for the current state of bilateral relations. However, in answering other questions, Roach said that he believed that the U.S. State Department's refusal to issue visas to the WPC delegation was its fault. Roach also admitted that the recent slanderous trials of the leaders of the American Communist Party were a serious violation of civil liberties.
    American Journalist Steele's Speech: The Peace Movement in Various Countries is Growing Stronger Day by Day; Warmongers' Obstruction is Ineffective
    Steele, an American journalist and member of the delegation, said in response to a question about the progress of the peace movement in the United States: Despite all the obstacles and conspiracies of the warmongers, the peace movement is growing stronger day by day. He said that in the United States, the peace movement takes many forms, and many organizations participate in it. I don't want to minimize the difficulties we all face - the active participants in the struggle for peace. Great pressure is being put on us, but I am convinced that 99 percent of Americans long for peace.
    Mamadou, Chairman of the French Black African Peace Committee, Senator Russo of Italy, and Deputy de la Vequerie of France, who were also members of the delegation, also spoke at the meeting about the development of the peace movement in their respective countries.

　　和大常设委员会保卫和平建议
    苏联第一个给予满意答复
    和大赴苏代表团招待记者谈话
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员赴苏代表团三月八日在向苏联最高苏维埃递交和平呼吁书后，举行了记者招待会。出席招待会者有苏联拥护和平委员会代表、苏联新闻界代表和外国记者等。
    代表团团长法奇在回答新闻界所提该团在执行其使命后对苏联印象如何的问题时说：苏联是第一个对常设委员会保卫和平的建议给予明确回答的国家。法奇指出：代表团已把常设委员会的呼吁书递交给意大利参、众两院的议长和法国国民议会议长。代表团曾试图把这一呼吁书递交荷兰议会，但却被驱逐出境。在比利时，代表团被迫把常设委员会的呼吁书邮寄给议会。至于美国，驻巴黎的美国大使馆竟拒绝给代表团团员以美国的入境签证。法奇满意地指出，苏联最高苏维埃领袖们的答复，使人有理由满怀希望。
    文幼章谈话指出美国民主自由已经消灭无存战贩气焰高涨
    加拿大和平委员会主席文幼章提到美国拒予代表团团员以入境签证一事说：北美洲现在再也没有自由了。在加拿大，假如和平拥护者要在什么屋子里举行会议的话，警察就有权封闭那所房子。文幼章继说：我以为我们可以正确无误地说，民主自由在美国已经消灭无存，而战争贩子却气焰高涨。在美国，争取和平的斗争，已变成了争取公民自由和公民权利的斗争。
    代表团团员之一、美国艺术家肯特强调说起代表团在莫斯科所受到的热情欢迎，他以羡慕的心情称颂苏联首都及其洁净的市街。
    代表团美国团员罗奇在答记者问时，说他的意见在某些方面与文幼章及肯特不同，罗奇企图放过美国发动所谓“冷战”的事实，而使美国和苏联对两国关系的现状负同等责任。但是在回答其他问题时，罗奇说：他认为美国国务院拒发和大代表团以入境签证，是它的过错。罗奇并承认：最近对美国共产党领袖诬蔑的审讯，严重侵犯了公民自由。
    美记者斯蒂尔致词各国和平运动正在日益壮大战贩阻碍无效
    代表团团员、美国新闻记者斯蒂尔回答关于和平运动在美国的进展说：尽管战争贩子的一切阻碍与阴谋，但和平运动正在日益壮大。他说，在美国，和平运动采取着多种多样的形式，并且有许多组织参加这一运动。我不想把我们大家——为和平而斗争的积极参加者——所面临的困难说小。大的压力正加在我们头上，但是我确信百分之九十九的美国人，是渴望和平的。
    代表团团员，法属黑人非洲和平委员会主席马马杜、意参议员鲁素、法议员德·拉·魏基利等，也在会上讲述了各该国和平运动发展的情况。
