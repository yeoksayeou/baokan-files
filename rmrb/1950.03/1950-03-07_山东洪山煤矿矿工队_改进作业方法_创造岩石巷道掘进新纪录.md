Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th: The mining team of Shan San Well in Hongshan Coal Mine, Shandong, has created a new record in rock tunnel excavation. In the past 25 days of last month, they excavated a total of 182.9 meters, exceeding the records of 86 meters per month at the Benxi Coal and Iron Company Coal Mine Department in Northeast China and 120 meters at the Jiawang Coal Mine in Xuzhou. The horizontal tunnel project of Shan San Well in Hongshan Coal Mine started last year, and the average monthly excavation was only 40 meters until January this year. Now, due to the emergence of the new record, the project will be completed half a year ahead of schedule. The emergence of this new record is the result of the mining team's improved operation methods. In the past, the deepest blasting holes were only one meter deep. After improvement, they were deepened to 1.6 meters. The number of blasting holes in one explosion also increased from about 14 or 15 to about 20. At the same time, they carefully studied the changes in the rock after blasting and improved the position and angle of the blasting holes, so that the amount of excavation per explosion increased from 60 to 80 centimeters to 1.4 meters. The working procedures have also been improved. In the past, after the explosion, the broken rocks had to be transported away before drilling holes. Now, efforts have been made to carry out drilling and stone transportation simultaneously, which greatly shortens the time interval between two explosions. In terms of labor organization, there is a clear division of labor for drilling, loading, transporting, and blasting, and close cooperation has been achieved, which has improved work efficiency. The mining team uses a wind drill to drill an eye in an average of nine minutes, loading a two-and-a-half-ton car of stones has been reduced from nine minutes to four minutes, transporting a stone truck back and forth in the roadway once takes nine minutes, and the entire process of blasting (loading, detonating, and exploding) only takes five minutes. In this way, the number of explosions per 24 hours has increased from two or three in the past to seven or eight now. The highest excavation record per 24 hours has reached as much as 8.7 meters.

### 山东洪山煤矿矿工队  改进作业方法  创造岩石巷道掘进新纪录

    改进作业方法
    创造岩石巷道掘进新纪录
    【新华社济南六日电】山东洪山煤矿山三井矿工队创造了岩石巷道掘进的新纪录。在上月二十五天内共掘进了一八二·九米，超过了东北本溪煤铁公司煤矿部每月掘进八十六米和徐州贾汪煤矿一百二十米的纪录。洪山煤矿山三井水平巷道工程从去年开始，到今年一月，每月平均掘进不过四十米。现在由于新纪录的出现，该项工程将提前半年完成。这一新纪录的出现，是该矿工队改进了作业方法的结果。过去按放炸药的炮眼最多挖到一米深，改进后加深至一·六米；一次爆炸的炮眼数也由十四、五个增加到二十个左右；同时，他们详细研究了爆破后岩石所起的变化，改进了炮眼按放的位置和角度，使一次爆破的掘进量，由六十至八十公分增加为一·四米。工作程序也有了改进。过去爆炸后，要先将炸碎的岩石运走再行打眼，现在已设法做到打眼和运石工作同时进行，使得两次爆炸间的时间距离大为缩短。在劳动组织方面，打眼、装车、搬运、发炮等均有了明确的分工，并做到紧密配合，工作效率也提高了。该矿工队用风钻打一个眼平均要九分钟，装满二吨半重的一车石头由九分钟减为四分钟，在巷道中来回搬运石车一次要九分钟，发炮的全部过程（装炮、点炮、爆炸）只要五分钟，这样，每二十四小时的爆破次数就由过去的二、三次增加为现在的七、八次。每二十四小时最高掘进纪录已达到八·七米之多。
