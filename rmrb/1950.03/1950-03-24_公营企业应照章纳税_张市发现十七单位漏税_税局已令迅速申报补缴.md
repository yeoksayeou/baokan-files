State-Owned Enterprises Should Pay Taxes According to Regulations
　　Zhangjiakou Discovers Seventeen Units Evading Taxes; Tax Bureau Orders Prompt Declaration and Payment

　　[This Newspaper’s News] According to a March 19th report in the Chahar Daily: The Zhangjiakou City Tax Bureau, during an inspection of tax evasion, discovered serious tax evasion by state-owned enterprises and production units of government agencies, affecting the completion of tax revenue tasks. According to the results of the city's inspections from March 3rd to 5th, the main units found to be evading taxes included the Zhangjiakou Egg Products Branch Company and sixteen other units. The tax evasion situations are as follows: The Egg Products Branch Company evaded taxes on thirteen bundles of hemp paper, the Fur Company on two boxes of brick tea, the Xinghua Flour Mill on thirty-nine bolts of cloth, the Yuxing Construction Company on forty bolts of cloth and five reams of glazed paper; as of the inspection, none of these had declared and paid the taxes. Secondly, those who declared and paid taxes after being discovered included the Jianye Store with over two thousand bolts of cloth (said to be stored by the 20th Army), ten large boxes of cigarettes, and over eighty bars of soap. There were also cases of delayed reporting and unauthorized resale, such as the Water Company storing over six hundred and sixty bolts of cloth, knowing that taxes should be paid, but in order to evade taxes, secretly selling two hundred and forty bolts. After being discovered, the responsible comrade of the company even tried to shirk responsibility, calling the Tax Bureau and saying, "You go find the cloth buyers!" The State-Owned Grain Company sold one hundred and forty bags of flour to the Yanqing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative before the new year, also without paying taxes. On March 6th, cadres from the Yanqing County Cooperative came to Zhangjiakou to transport the flour, but could not transport it due to unpaid taxes, and the company adopted an attitude of irresponsibility after the goods were shipped, refusing to pay taxes. After being discovered by the Tax Bureau, a certain cadre of the company even said to the comrades of the Tax Bureau with dissatisfaction: "Your actions will inevitably destroy the enterprise sector!" The products of the Prison Flour Mill have never been taxed. After the city's leading organs learned of this, they notified them to pay taxes, but have not yet paid. The Xinhua Tannery underreported one hundred and seventy various hides. The People's Construction and Lumber Factory originally had six bolts of Wufu cloth, seventy bolts of Gaoyang cloth, and two hundred and seventy-one bolts of Gaoyang blue cloth, but only reported one hundred and thirty-eight bolts to the Tax Bureau, evading taxes on two hundred and nine bolts.

　　All of the above tax evasion households have seriously undermined the tax revenue policy and affected the state's financial income. The Chahar Daily published a short commentary pointing out: "The reason why they have this behavior, we believe: is not that they do not understand the government's tax revenue policy, the root lies in: the selfishness of some cadres and the anarchic and undisciplined thinking at play. They seem to think that: the state's policies are for the people to abide by, and they are 'public servants' and can ignore them. This erroneous ideology and style of work directly hinders the progress of tax revenue work and affects the state's financial income. In order to ensure the completion of tax revenue work, this ideological obstacle must be cleared in state-owned enterprises and production units of government agencies." The City Tax Bureau has now ordered all tax-evading units to promptly declare, otherwise, they will be severely punished according to regulations.

　　公营企业应照章纳税
    张市发现十七单位漏税  税局已令迅速申报补缴
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报三月十九日消息：张家口市税务局在检查偷漏税中，发现公营企业和机关生产单位有严重地偷税漏税现象，影响税收任务的完成。根据该市三月三日至五日稽查结果，发现偷漏税的主要单位有张家口蛋品分公司等十七个单位。漏税情形如下：蛋品分公司有十三捆麻纸漏税，皮毛公司两箱砖茶，兴华面粉厂布三十九匹，玉兴建筑公司布四十匹，油光纸五领，到检查时为止都还未申报补税。其次经查出后申报补税的，有建业商店的布二千多匹（据说是二十兵团存的），香烟十大箱，肥皂八十多条。还有拖延不报私自转卖的，如自来水公司存布六百六十多匹，明知应征税，但为偷税，私自卖出二百四十匹，经查出后，该公司负责同志还想推脱责任，给税务局打电话说：“你们去找买布户吧！”国营粮食公司，年前卖给延庆县供销社面粉一百四十袋，也未纳税，延庆县社干部于三月六日来张市运面，因未纳税不能运走，而该公司抱着推出货不管的态度，不予补税。经税务局查出后，该公司某干部还带着不满的情绪向税务局的同志说：“你们这样作非把企业部门摧垮不可！”监狱面粉厂的产品，始终未纳税。市领导机关知道后，通知他们纳税，到现在还未补税。新华制革厂少报各种皮子一百七十张。人民建筑制材厂原存五福布六匹，高阳布七十匹，高阳青布二百七十一匹，只向税务局报了一百三十八匹，偷税二百零九匹。
    以上这些偷漏税户，都是严重地破坏了税收政策，影响国家财政收入的。察哈尔日报为此特著短论指出：“他们之所以有这种表现，我们认为：并非他们不懂得政府的税收政策，根源就在于：部分干部的本位主义思想和无政府无组织思想作怪。他们似乎认为：国家的政策是要人民来遵守的，自己是‘公家人’，可以不遵守。这种错误的思想作风，就直接阻碍了税收工作的进行，影响国家的财政收入。为保证税收工作的完成，必须在公营企业与机关生产单位中，扫清这种思想障碍。”现市税务局已令各偷漏税单位迅速申报，否则，照章严惩。
