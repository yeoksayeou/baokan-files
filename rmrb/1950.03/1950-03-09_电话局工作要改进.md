To the Editor:

I believe the work of the Beijing Telephone Bureau still needs improvement. Recently, because we are building a factory, we need to install a telephone (location at No. 5 Yard, North of Cheng'en Temple). However, we sent an official letter to the Telephone Bureau on the 23rd of last month, and after waiting for four days, the bureau sent someone to check the line. After the line inspector returned, we waited until March 2nd to receive the payment notice. We sent the payment within three hours of receiving the notice. But today (3rd) when we called to ask, "When will the installation be done?" the bureau replied, "It will take another five days to install." We are not clear about the reason, but according to the line inspector, the main reason for their slow work is the insufficient integration of engineering and business (i.e., the back-and-forth procedures), with too many formalities. The engineering side is very fast. If this is indeed the case, we believe that the responsible comrades of the bureau must earnestly study and review this. Learn from the experience of telephone bureaus in various northeastern cities (where installations generally take only two or three days). Otherwise, this will cause a great loss to our work and will not keep up with the needs of economic construction.

### 电话局工作要改进

　　电话局工作要改进编辑同志：
    我认为北京电话局的工作尚须改进。最近我们因为在建设工厂，须装设一个电话（地点在承恩寺北大五院）。但我们上月二十三号就给电话局去了公函，等了四天，该局才派人来查线路。查线的回去后，等到三月二号交款通知书才送来。我们在接到通知后的三小时内就把款送去了。但今日（三日）去电话问：“何时能来装？”该局回答：“再有五天才能去装。”原因我们不清楚，不过据查线的工友说：他们工作慢的主要原因是工务和业务（即来回办手续的）结合不够，手续太多。工务上是很快的。如果确实是这样，我们认为该局负责同志必须认真负责加以研究和检讨。学习一下东北各城市电话局的经验（东北一般都是两三天就能装上）。不然，这样会使工作受很大损失，就赶不上经济建设的需要。
