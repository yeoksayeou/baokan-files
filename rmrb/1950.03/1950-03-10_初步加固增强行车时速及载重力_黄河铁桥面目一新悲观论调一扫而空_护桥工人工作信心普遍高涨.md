Preliminary Reinforcement Increases Driving Speed and Load Capacity
The Yellow River Iron Bridge Takes on a New Look, Sweeping Away Pessimistic Views
Bridge Maintenance Workers' Confidence Soars

[Our newspaper's Zhengzhou special dispatch] Reporter Chen Ji reports: The long-neglected and dilapidated Yellow River Iron Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, after preliminary reinforcement, has significantly increased its driving speed and load capacity, powerfully shattering the pessimistic view that "the Yellow River Iron Bridge is beyond repair and cannot continue to be used." The Yellow River Iron Bridge has exceeded its warranty period by thirty years. In the past, during the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, the Yellow River Bridge never underwent maintenance or repair work, resulting in severe damage to the bridge foundation, bridge piers, and bridge beams, with warped bridge deck rails and decayed sleepers, reducing the driving speed to five kilometers per hour. The bridge was widely recognized as "beyond repair." Passengers were also apprehensive when trains passed over the Yellow River Bridge, viewing it as a daunting journey. Most bridge engineering technicians and the workers managing the bridge also said, "What's the point of using such an old thing? Why repair it?" They placed their hopes on "building a new bridge" and adopted a dismissive and passive attitude towards the maintenance of the Yellow River Bridge. At the end of last year, when the Beijing-Hankou Railway was about to be fully restored and opened to traffic, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, in order to ensure traffic safety and increase driving speed, hired Soviet experts to conduct a thorough on-site survey of the Yellow River Iron Bridge. The Soviet experts believed that the bridge could continue to be used after appropriate reinforcement. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau formally established the Yellow River Iron Bridge Engineering Section in February this year, specifically responsible for the bridge's maintenance work. At the same time, employees were mobilized to lay guard rails and replace sleepers to avoid traffic accidents; over 1,000 cubic meters of rubble were thrown to protect the bridge foundation and bridge piers. After preliminary reinforcement, the driving speed of the bridge immediately increased from five kilometers to fifteen kilometers, and the traction force doubled. The entire bridge took on a new look. The pessimistic view that the Yellow River Bridge could not continue to be used and that its load capacity could not be increased was also swept away. When the reporter interviewed Xu Yu'en, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch on the south bank of the Bridge Engineering Section, he recalled the situation of the bridge last year, saying, "At that time, everyone thought that the Yellow River Bridge could no longer be used, and everyone did not pay attention to the maintenance of the Yellow River Bridge." Now, the workers' work enthusiasm has generally increased, and they are actively establishing inspection groups and repair groups to be responsible for regular maintenance work. They said that the bridge is their own home and their own property, and they must never be indifferent to it as they were in the past. When trains pass over the Yellow River Bridge, the workers are nervously waiting on the bridge, carefully checking the bridge's condition. The farmers near the Yellow River Bridge also said that it was the first time in thirty or forty years that they had seen the Yellow River Bridge change its appearance. When the reporter interviewed Zhengzhou Railway employees and engineers, they unanimously stated, "As long as we maintain it well and pay attention to reinforcement work, it doesn't matter if the Yellow River Bridge is used for another eight or nine years." In order to further improve the condition of the Yellow River Bridge, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has recently formulated a plan for overhauling the Yellow River Bridge, so as to repair the Yellow River Iron Bridge before the Ministry of Railways' reinforcement engineering design arrives. The plan proposes a total of seventeen repair tasks, such as storing 10,000 cubic meters of rubble to protect the dikes on both sides of the Yellow River, replacing decayed wooden trestles, changing single-layer military beams to double-layer military beams, adding bolts between each row and each layer of military beams, replacing steel rails, painting steel beams, and tidying up the bridge deck, etc. The Yellow River Bridge Engineering Section's trade union is now organizing the workforce to ensure the completion of the reinforcement plan.

　　初步加固增强行车时速及载重力
    黄河铁桥面目一新悲观论调一扫而空
    护桥工人工作信心普遍高涨
    【本报郑州特讯】记者陈迹报导：年久失修的京汉路黄河大铁桥，经过初步加固，行车时速及载重力均显著增加，有力地打破了“黄河铁桥已经无可救药，不能继续使用”的悲观论调。黄河大铁桥已经超过保固期限三十年。过去在国民党腐败统治时期，黄河桥从无养护修检工作。致桥基、桥脚、桥梁受到严重损毁，桥面轨道歪曲，枕木腐朽，行车时速降至五公里。该桥早被公认为“不可救药”的了。火车通过黄河桥时，乘客亦提心吊胆，视为畏途。一般桥梁工程技术人员及管理该桥的工人们也说：“这样旧的东西，用它干啥？修它干吗？”都把希望寄托在“修建新桥”上面。对黄河桥的养护工作，采取轻视和消极的态度。去年底，京汉路即将全线修复通车时，中央人民政府铁道部为保证行车安全，提高行车速率，曾聘请苏联专家实地周详勘查黄河铁桥。苏联专家认为该桥经过适当加固后，仍可继续使用。郑州路局乃于今年二月正式成立黄河铁桥工程段，专门负责该桥保养工作。同时发动员工铺设护轮轨，更换枕木，以避免行车事故；抛投一千余立方公尺片石，以护桥基桥脚。经过初步加固后，该桥行车时速即由五公里提高到十五公里，牵引力提高一倍。全桥面目一新。认为黄河桥不能继续使用，不能增加载重力的悲观论调，亦一扫而空。记者访问桥工段南岸中共支部书记许玉恩，他回忆去年桥梁的情形时说：“那时候，大家都以为黄河桥不能再用了，大家对于黄河桥的保养工作也就没有重视。”现在工人们的工作情绪普遍高涨，正积极成立包检组和包修组，负责进行经常的养护工作。他们说桥就是自己的家，自己的财产，决不能再像过去那样不关心它了。列车通过黄河桥时，工人们都紧张地守候在桥上，周详地检查桥梁状况。黄河桥附近的农民们也说，三四十年来第一次看见黄河桥变了样了。记者访问郑州铁路员工和工程师时，他们一致表示：“只要好好养护，注意加固工作，黄河桥再使用八九年也没有关系。”郑州路局为进一步改善黄河桥状况，最近又拟定了大修黄河桥的计划，以便在铁道部的加固工程设计未到之前，修理黄河铁桥。该项计划共提出十七项修理工作，如储藏片石一万立方公尺，保护黄河两岸岸堤，抽换腐朽木排架，改单层军用梁为双层军用梁，加增军用梁各排各层间的螺栓，抽换钢轨，油漆钢梁，整理桥面等等。黄河桥桥工段工会，现正组织员工力量，保证完成该项加固计划。
