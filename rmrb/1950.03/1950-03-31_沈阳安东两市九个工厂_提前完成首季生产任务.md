Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 30th: Nine factories in Shenyang and Andong cities have completed or exceeded their first quarter production tasks ahead of schedule. As of March 20th, the Shenyang No. 5 Textile Factory had exceeded its first quarter production task, producing an extra 10,000 bolts of cloth, with quality also exceeding the prescribed standards. The main reason for the factory's early completion of the task was that the factory's administrative leadership grasped the central link, organized workers to concentrate their efforts on installing machines, enabling the spindles to start 13 days ahead of schedule and the looms to start 8 days ahead of schedule. The Shenyang Smelter also completed its full quarter production plan ahead of schedule. In February's production, the factory completed the entire month's production task in 15 days. In March, through the efforts of all cadres and workers, a new record of exceeding the entire month's plan in 13 days was created, with crude copper exceeding by 86.6% and electrolytic copper (finished product) exceeding by 26.7%. The Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Factory had completed its first quarter production task by the 18th of this month; by the 22nd, it had overproduced by 10 spiral lathes. In addition, the six factories that completed and exceeded the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule are the Nail Making Factory No. 1 under the Shenyang Automotive General Factory, the Shenyang Battery Factory, the Shenyang Paper Mill, the Hardened Oil Field under the Chemical Plant, the Andong Paper Mill, and the Liaodong Provincial State-run Danhua Match Factory.
