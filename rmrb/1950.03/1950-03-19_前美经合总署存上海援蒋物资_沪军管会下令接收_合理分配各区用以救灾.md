Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 18th: The Shanghai Military Control Commission, at the request of the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee, issued an order on the 16th to seize all supplies stored in Shanghai by the former United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office, which were intended to aid Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in carrying out the civil war. These supplies will be used for emergency production and disaster relief. The East China Production and Disaster Relief Committee and the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee are responsible for inventorying these supplies and formulating a distribution and usage plan, which will be submitted to the East China Military and Administrative Committee for approval before implementation. Note: Since the liberation of Shanghai, the负责人 [person in charge] of the former UNRRA China Office in Shanghai has repeatedly proclaimed their willingness to use these supplies for disaster relief. In reality, they have been using this as a pretext to establish special organizations and continue to interfere in China's internal affairs, sitting idly by as the supplies rot and deteriorate, and consistently refusing to hand them over to Chinese relief organizations for genuine relief purposes. In light of the urgent needs of disaster victims, the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee recently sent representatives to negotiate repeatedly with the负责人 of the UNRRA office regarding the use of these supplies. The负责人 raised various conditions that interfered with internal affairs, leading to fruitless negotiations. Therefore, the Shanghai Military Control Commission accepted the request of the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee and ordered the complete seizure of these supplies, handing them over to the East China Production and Disaster Relief Committee and the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee for rational distribution to various disaster areas for disaster relief.

　　前美经合总署存上海援蒋物资
    沪军管会下令接收
    合理分配各区用以救灾
    【新华社上海十八日电】上海市军事管制委员会，根据上海市生产救灾委员会的请求，已于十六日下令接收前美国经济合作总署中国分署存放在沪市的曾图用以援助蒋匪进行内战的全部物资，作为紧急进行生产救灾之用。华东生产救灾委员会和上海生产救灾委员会，已负责清理此项物资并拟定分配使用计划，呈请华东军政委员会核准后实行。按：自上海解放后，上海前美国经济合作总署中国分署负责人，虽曾屡次宣传愿将该项物资用于救灾，实则假借名义，企图建立特殊组织，继续干涉中国内政，致坐视物资霉烂损耗，始终不肯交与中国救济团体作真正救济之用。上海市生产救灾委员会鉴于灾民紧急需要，近曾推派代表向该分署负责人一再交涉使用该项物资，该负责人又提出干涉内政的种种条件，致交涉毫无结果。因此上海市军管会乃接受上海市生产救灾委员会的请求，下令将该项物资全部予以接收，交华东生产救灾委员会和上海生产救灾委员会合理地分配各灾区作为救灾之用。
