[Beijing News] Beijing Bus Company's Sixth Route (Guang'anmen to Ciqikou) began a trial collective contract on February 1st. After joint efforts by workers and management to implement it, ticket revenue has now exceeded the level before the contract by an average of 7%, making Route 6 a model route for the entire company.

Route 6 is the most difficult route to drive due to its narrow and uneven roads. Active elements among the company's drivers and station staff, in order to ensure the completion of the 1950 production plan, launched several groups, voluntarily requesting to operate Route 6 for the long term in order to prevent the problem of inconsistent service on the route. After the company received their request to take responsibility for Route 6, it immediately agreed and encouraged them. The trade union also convened a general meeting of all route personnel, reporting the challenge from some workers to take responsibility for Route 6. Many drivers, ticket sellers, station staff, and others immediately signed up to participate. Finally, fourteen contract groups (twenty-eight people), plus four station staff, two liaison officers, and two coal stokers, were organized to jointly take responsibility for Route 6 buses. After discussion, everyone made the following guarantees to the company: no breakdowns; no missed fares; no more than five minutes between buses; avoid accidents; reduce malfunctions; be courteous to passengers; save fuel and materials; and set the mileage and cost for minor, medium, and major repairs. The management also guaranteed: appropriate personnel coordination and fixed personnel, with no easy changes; the establishment of a vehicle inspection, maintenance, and repair system; timely supply of materials, tools, and fuel; and complete facilities at both terminals. The management also proposed a reward system for exceeding the task: for example, exceeding by 10% would result in a reward of 10% of the excess; exceeding by 20%, a reward of 15%; exceeding by 30%, a reward of 20%; exceeding by 40%, a reward of 30%, and so on. The collective contract is valid for three months, starting from February 1st. Since its implementation, it has achieved punctual departures, accurate intervals, reduced malfunctions and accidents, and a significant increase in ticket revenue. (Hu Guangjin)

The transformation of trade union work is the foundation for the conclusion of collective contracts and the progress of work.

[This newspaper reports] The work of the Beijing Bus Company has seen many improvements since February. Taking Route 6 as an example, in late January, there were an average of two or three accidents per day, sometimes as many as four or five. In the first half of February, there were none. Due to the reduction in accidents, the time interval between vehicles has become more normal, the number of passengers has increased, and operating revenue has also increased by 18%. Fuel consumption is 34% lower than before. The workers also automatically use their rest time to repair vehicles in order to avoid delaying service. Under their influence, the No. 14 truck (tractor) has also entered into a contact agreement with them to ensure punctual departures for Route 6 every morning, which has also improved work efficiency. Now all routes are considering the conclusion of collective contracts.

The direct cause of the improvement in the company's work is the promotion of collective contracts. However, the foundation for the emergence of collective contracts is that the trade union work has a clear "production first" policy, overcoming the simple welfare mentality. The company's trade union preparatory committee previously had an unclear work policy. It shouted empty slogans about welfare, paid little attention to production, and engaged in unprincipled disputes with the management, so it played a very small role in production. After the re-election of the CCP branch in the company in early December last year, it was decided to focus on improving trade union work, implementing democratic elections, and formally establishing the trade union. In mid-December, the Party branch assisted the trade union preparatory committee in conducting worker education, enlightening class consciousness, and implementing the central idea of doing a good job in production. After in-depth discussions in various groups, the members initially understood the nature and tasks of the trade union and proposed to convene a workers' representative meeting to formally establish the trade union. The criteria for representatives were also based on a good attitude towards labor and achievements in production. After a three-day representative meeting, the future work policy was clarified, mainly to improve production. On the basis of developing production, welfare will be gradually improved. After a large number of activists with ties to the masses were elected, the face of the trade union changed. Subsequently, the management announced the 1950 production plan, requiring a surplus of one million jin of millet this year (last year there was a loss). The new trade union immediately called on everyone to work hard to ensure the completion of this plan. At this time, the workers' thinking had undergone a great change. In the past, they only complained that the trade union was not doing enough on welfare work. Now they say, "Pancakes don't fall from the sky. If we work hard and earn more money, everyone's welfare will improve!" Everyone is thinking all day long, "How can we increase the number of buses, reduce accidents, and increase revenue?" Route 6 is narrow and uneven, with many buses, prone to accidents, far from the company, requiring early departures and late returns. In the past, no one wanted to go there, but now many activists have voluntarily organized themselves, asking to take responsibility for it and run this route forever. Then many more people responded enthusiastically. The route has fourteen buses, requiring twenty-eight drivers and ticket sellers, but more than sixty people signed up. Then, they concluded a collective contract with the management, making several specific guarantees to each other. In this way, the work improved even faster.

　　北京公共汽车公司试订集体合同收效
    做到准时出车事故减少  营业收入增百分之十八
    【北京讯】北京公共汽车公司第六路（广安门到磁器口）于二月一日开始试订集体合同后，经工人与行政方面共同努力执行，现在票款收入平均已超过订合同前的百分之七，使六路成为全公司的模范路。
    六路路面狭窄不平，是最难行驶的一路。公司里车路司机和站员的积极分子为了保证完成一九五零年的生产计划，就发动了几个小组，自动要求长期行驶六路，以防止六路行车时多时少的毛病。公司接到他们要包行六路的要求后，马上同意并予以鼓励。工会也召开了全体车路人员大会，报告一部分工人要包六路的挑战。当场又有许多司机、售票、站员等报名参加。最后组成十四个包乘小组（二十八人），另加四个站员，两个联络员，和两个加柴工人，组织起来，共同包行六路公共汽车。大家讨论后，向公司提出保证：不抛锚；不漏票；两车间隔不过五分钟；避免事故；减少故障；对乘客和蔼；节省燃料材料；定出碎修、中修、大修的里数和费用。行政方面也保证：人事配合恰当、人员固定，不轻易变动；建立车辆检修、保养、换修的制度；及时供给材料、工具和燃料；两端站上要设备完善。行政方面并提出超过任务的奖励制度：例如超过了百分之十，就提出超过部分的百分之十来奖励；超过百分之二十，提奖百分之十五；超过百分之三十，提奖百分之二十；超过百分之四十，提奖百分之三十，余类推。集体合同有效期间三个月，从二月一日实行，实行以来，已经做到了准时出车，间隔准确，减少了故障和事故，并使票款收入显著增多。（胡光锦）
    工会工作的转变，是订定集体合同与工作进展的基础。
    【本报讯】北京市公共汽车公司的工作，二月份以来有不少改进。以第六路说，一月份下旬每天平均出两三次事故，多至四、五次。二月上半月则一次都没发生。由于事故减少，车辆的时间间隔趋向正常，乘客增多，营业收入也增加百分之十八。燃料比以前少用百分之三十四。工友们并自动利用休息时间检修车辆，以免耽搁行车。在他们影响下，十四号卡车（曳引车）为保证六路每晨准时出车，即与之订立联系合同，也提高了工作效率。现在各路都在酝酿订立集体合同。
    该公司工作获得改进，直接的原因是集体合同的推动。但集体合同产生的基础，则是工会工作有了明确的“生产第一”方针，克服了单纯福利思想。该公司工会筹委会，以前工作方针是不明确的。空喊福利，很少注意生产，又与行政方面闹无原则纠纷，因此在生产上起作用很小。去年十二月初，公司内中共党的支部改选后，决定以改进工会工作为重点，实行民主选举，正式成立工会。十二月中旬，党的支部协助工会筹委会进行工人教育，启发阶级觉悟，并贯彻搞好生产的中心思想。经各小组深入讨论，会员们初步认识了工会的性质与任务，即提出要召开工人代表会，正式成立工会。代表的条件，也以劳动态度好和生产有成绩为主。经过三天代表会议，明确了今后的工作方针，主要是提高生产。在发展生产的基础上，逐渐改进福利。当大批和群众有联系的积极分子当选后，工会面貌便改观了。接着，行政上宣布了一九五○年的生产计划，要求今年盈余小米一百万斤（去年亏了本）。新工会即号召大家为保证完成此一计划而努力。此时，工人思想已有极大转变。过去他们光嫌工会对福利工作做得不够，现在他们说：“天上掉不下烙饼来。咱们努力干，挣钱多了，大伙福利就会改善！”大家都整天考虑：“怎样才能多出车，减少事故，增加收入”。第六路狭窄不平、车多、易出事故，离公司远，要早出晚归，以前谁也不愿去，现在却有许多积极分子自动组织起来，要求包乘，永远走这条路。接着又有许多人热烈响应。该路十四辆车，需要司机与售票人员二十八名，报名的就有六十多。接着，他们与行政订立了集体合同，互相提出若干具体保证。这样，工作就改进得更快了。
