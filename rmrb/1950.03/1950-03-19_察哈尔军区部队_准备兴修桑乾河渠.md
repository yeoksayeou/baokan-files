　　Chahar Military Region Troops
    Prepare to Build the Sanggan River Canal
    [Report from this newspaper] Chahar Daily News: In order to thoroughly implement the task of the Chahar Military Region Production Committee to build the Yuhe Canal and Sanggan River Canal in the province, the military region's troops (excluding Chabei) are actively carrying out ideological mobilization, preparing tools, and organizing labor. It has been decided to start work around March 20th. Liu Bin, Chief of Staff of the Provincial Military Region, and Comrade Hu Jingxiu of the Political Department, along with the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, went to the construction area to survey the canals and divide the engineering sections. On January 5th, each unit sent cadres to the Sanggan River area to specifically allocate garrison areas. The Supply Department fully prepared grain and coal, and rushed to make more than one hundred large pots, which have been sent to the project area. At present, each unit is actively manufacturing and purchasing tools, and some units have completed preparations. The Military Region Production Cooperative General Branch manufactured and purchased fifty wheelbarrows. Most of the tools were solved by their own efforts. For example, the Chanan Sub-district found skilled workers among the soldiers and organized carpentry groups, blacksmith shops, and basket weaving groups, and mobilized everyone to go up the mountain to cut shrubs to make canal construction tools. Except for a few units that have not yet completed all preparations, most can achieve two people per shovel, ten people per pickaxe, two people per basket, and four people per carrying pole. In terms of labor organization, the entire military region plans to participate with 4,800 people, specifically assigned to various troops, with some being organized into production groups for meticulous organizational work. In order to make all commanders and fighters deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's "instructions on troops participating in production," each unit has carried out ideological mobilization and education. The 2nd Guard Regiment systematically studied the instructions on troops participating in production. The Guard Company conducted political education among the soldiers with production as the center. Xiao Guifen, a soldier from the 4th Platoon, said: "We are all from peasant backgrounds, so we are no strangers to production." Everyone challenged each other, and all comrades in the 1st Platoon expressed: "We are determined to make contributions and strive to be models on the production front."
