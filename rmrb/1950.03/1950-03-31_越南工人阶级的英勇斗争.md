　　The Heroic Struggle of the Vietnamese Working Class
    Bo Dekobayev

    In 1930, the Indochinese Communist Party was established. Since then, under its leadership, the leading force in the struggle for national liberation has been the young Vietnamese working class. For twenty years, the working class and its organizations have consistently led the working people in their struggle to break free from the shackles of imperialism. The working class was the soul of the famous Bac Son Uprising of 1940. Since the establishment of the Viet Minh (Vietnam Independence League) in 1941 – in which the workers played a decisive role – Vietnam's national liberation movement has reached a vigorous high point. From 1941 to 1945, the Viet Minh aroused the masses of working people in the country to engage in a heroic armed struggle against the Japanese occupiers and the French traitors who collaborated with them.

    During World War II, the Vietnamese working class, joining the ranks of the democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, made a great contribution to the cause of crushing the fascist aggressors. Now they are holding weapons to defend the independence of the Republic, strengthening the cause of world peace.

    Although the working class in Vietnam only totals about 500,000 people out of Vietnam's 20 million residents, workers account for an exceptionally high percentage in the Vietnamese army. Individual units or even entire teams in the army are composed of workers. They are always in the most heavily burdened areas, and the most difficult tasks are always entrusted to them. The nationally famous army units mainly composed of workers include Ho Chi Minh's Haiphong Battalion, Saigon Battalion, and other units. The name of 26-year-old worker Shao Dao (transliteration) from Haiphong is extremely well-known. He destroyed six French tanks and thirty armored vehicles and eliminated more than 200 occupation troops. Thousands of Vietnamese workers are fighting extremely bravely against the French colonialists.

    In the areas temporarily occupied by the French army, the working class organized mass resistance movements to oppose the occupiers' attempts to strangle the Republic of Vietnam by exploiting the economic resources of the occupied areas. Enterprises and warehouses in French hands are constantly attacked by guerrillas. In these enterprises, workers stage slowdowns and strikes, inflicting huge damage on the French colonialists. As a result, coal production in the occupied areas dropped from 2 million tons in 1940 to 339,000 tons in 1948. Cement production fell from 300,000 tons in 1939 to 90,000 tons in 1948.

    The situation is completely different in the territories of the Republic liberated from French oppression. Although long-term military operations have caused serious damage to Vietnam's industry and agriculture, significant achievements have been made in economic recovery in the areas cleared of occupiers. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, established in 1946 – which now has nearly 300,000 organized workers – plays a major role in this.

    The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor joined the World Federation of Trade Unions and actively fought for the unity of the world workers' movement. The Republic's trade unions attended the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Milan and the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference in Beijing, and were warmly and prolonged applauded by the delegates present.

    From the very beginning of its establishment, the Vietnam Trade Union has been integrated with the domestic democratic forces, and it has actively helped the Republic government in its struggle against the imperialist oppressors. Since 1947, military factories or workshops have been organized in every province to produce weapons and military supplies.

    The Vietnam Trade Union is the organizer of patriotic emulation. This competition was launched in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to commemorate the third anniversary of the founding of the Republic. Each enterprise has formulated a production plan for one to two months and organized competitions to strive to complete them. The trade unions participate in the formulation of these plans and supervise their implementation. Since last year, the General Confederation of Labor has awarded national bonuses and the title of Labor Hero to the workers with the best results in patriotic emulation on the anniversary of the Republic.

    This movement has achieved tremendous results. The North Vietnam Trade Union Congress in May 1949 pointed out that, due to patriotic emulation, the production power of various military industries had increased by 60 percent by the end of 1948, and even doubled in some areas. The competition also promoted improvements in the textile and mining industries.

    The Vietnamese working class must overcome many difficulties in developing the national economy. The country lacks raw materials and machinery, and under the conditions of economic blockade, it must rely on its own strength. Nevertheless, Vietnam has now built smelting furnaces and is able to produce metal manufacturing, textile and other machine tools. A big step forward has been taken in the rationalization of labor and the improvement of technological processes. Research laboratories have been organized to study new methods of production.

    The Ho Chi Minh government recently formulated a massive plan to develop industry. Phan Anh, Minister of National Economy, announced in the General Confederation of Labor's newspaper "Trade Union" that the basis of this plan is:

    1. Make every effort to develop the state-owned and cooperative industrial sectors; 2. Encourage the development of private national enterprises, but the working class must provide necessary supervision; 3. Expand the production of military industries; 4. Develop handicraft production; 5. Improve the technology of industrial construction and reconstruction projects; 6. Make every effort to develop domestic and foreign trade; 7. Improve the organization of transportation and supply systems; 8. Strengthen the economic blockade against the enemy and sabotage in the enemy's production.

    Phan Anh pointed out: "In realizing this economic plan, the workers will play a major role... They will directly participate in the management of enterprises."

    In recent years, the workers of Vietnam have not only learned to fight the enemy with weapons, but also learned to organize enterprises and lead them. Workers' committees have been established in every factory. Many leaders of state-owned and cooperative enterprises (which account for the majority of enterprises in the country) are workers. The leaders of the enterprises must report to the members of the trade union and listen to their opinions on how to improve the work. The General Confederation of Labor has its own representatives on the State National Economic Planning Commission and the government's Labor Commission.

    In Vietnam's economic plan, the issue of agricultural development occupies an important position. The government attempts to fundamentally change the feudal land use system. Rent reduction decrees, the distribution of public land, and the distribution of French occupiers' land to poor peasants - these are the first steps in solving the agricultural problem. Methods have been adopted to improve agricultural technology and increase harvests. Workers are expanding the production of chemical fertilizers and agricultural implements. As a result of fundamental changes in land use, the cultivated area in many areas of northern Vietnam has reached the pre-war range, and the harvest volume has exceeded the pre-war average harvest volume by 25 percent.

    Despite the difficulties caused by the war, Ho Chi Minh's democratic government pays great attention to improving the material and cultural living conditions of the workers. The General Confederation of Labor has also done a lot of work in this regard. In November 1946, the National Assembly of the Republic of Vietnam approved the Labor Law, which was drafted with the active participation of the trade unions. The Labor Law stipulates restrictions on the length of the working week, vacations with pay, sickness benefits and pensions. The war against the imperialist occupiers is still temporarily hindering its full implementation. Workers, with a high degree of awareness of their responsibilities, respond to the trade union's call to expand production, often voluntarily continuing to work after work.

　　越南工人阶级的英勇斗争
    波德柯巴耶夫
    一九三○年，印度支那共产党建立了。从那时起，在她的领导之下，争取国家解放斗争中的领导力量即是越南年青的工人阶级。工人阶级及其组织在二十年的时期中，始终一贯地领导着劳动人民为解除帝国主义枷锁而斗争。工人阶级是一九四○年著名的班松（东京）起义的灵魂。从一九四一年创立了越盟（越南独立联盟）以后——其中决定性的作用是属于工人的——越南的民族解放运动即达到有力的高涨时期。在一九四一至一九四五年间，越盟唤起国内劳动群众从事英雄的武装斗争以反抗日本占领者及与其合作的法国叛徒。
    第二次世界大战间，步入以苏联为首的民主力量行列之中的越南工人阶级，对粉碎法西斯侵略者的事业给与了伟大的贡献。现在他们手握武器保卫共和国的独立，加强着全世界的和平事业。
    虽然，在越南的二千万居民中，工人阶级总共只有五十万人左右，但是工人在越南军队中却占有异常高的百分数。军队中个别部分甚至一整队人都是由工人组成的。他们总是在最负重责的地带，同时一向是委托给他们最艰巨的任务。全国著名的主要由工人组成的军队有胡志明的海防营、有西贡营及其他部分等。海防的二十六岁的工人邵岛（译音）的名字是异常著名的。他曾炸毁了六辆法国坦克和三十辆装甲车并消灭了二百多名占领军。数以千计的越南工人都异常勇敢地与法国殖民者战斗着。
    在暂时被法军占领的区域，工人阶级组织了群众抵抗运动，以反对占领者利用被占区的经济财源绞杀越南共和国的企图。法国人手中的企业与仓库，受到游击队的不断袭击。在这些企业中工人们举行怠工、罢工，给予法国殖民者以巨大的损害。结果，在被占领区域的产煤量，从一九四○年的二百万吨，降低到一九四八年的三十三万九千吨。而水泥的生产，则从一九三九年的三十万吨降低到一九四八年的九万吨。
    在从法国压迫下解放了的共和国领土上，则完全是另一种情景。虽然长期军事行动使越南的工业及农业蒙受了严重的损失，但是在清除了占领者的区域内，经济恢复方面已达到了重大的成就。其中一九四六年成立的越南总工会——现已拥有近三十万有组织的职工——起着很大的作用。
    越南总工会加入了世界工联并积极地为争取世界工人运动的团结而斗争。共和国的职工会曾出席米兰的世界工联的第二次大会及北京的亚澳职工代表会议，曾受到出席代表们的热烈而长久的鼓掌欢迎。
    越南职工会从成立的最初时起，就与国内民主力量结合在一起，它积极地帮助共和国政府进行反对帝国主义压迫者的斗争。从一九四七年起，每省中都已经组织了军事工厂或制作场以生产武器和军需品。
    越南职工会是爱国竞赛的组织者。此一竞赛是由胡志明主席纪念共和国成立三周年纪念时的号召而展开的。每个企业中都制订了一个月到二个月的生产计划同时组织争取完成它们的竞赛。职工会参加这些计划的制订并监督其实现，从去年开始，总工会在共和国周年纪念日时，即颁给在爱国竞赛中成绩最好的工人们以国民奖金和劳动英雄称号。
    这个运动获得了巨大的成果。一九四九年五月北越职工会代表大会曾指出，由于爱国竞赛，各军事工业生产威力在一九四八年末已增长了百分之六十，某些地区甚至增加了一倍。竞赛同样也促使纺织业及矿业工作的改善。
    越南的工人阶级，在发展国民经济的路上必需克服许多困难。国内缺乏原料与机器，而在经济封锁的条件下，必需依靠自己的力量。虽然如此，在越南现已建起了熔矿炉，已能出产金属制造、纺织及其他母机了。在劳动合理化及改善技术过程方面，已向前跨了一大步。组织了研究实验室以研究生产的新方法。
    胡志明政府在最近曾制订了发展工业的庞大计划。国民经济部长潘英在总工会机关报“职工会”上公布这一计划的基础是：
    １尽力发展国营及合作社的工业部门；２鼓励民族私营企业的发展，但工人阶级要给以必要的监督；３扩大军事工业的生产；４发展手工业生产；５改善工业建设及重建计划的技术；６尽力发展内外贸易；７改善交通工具和补给制度的组织；８加强对敌人的经济封锁和敌人生产中的怠工。
    潘英指出：“在实现这个经济计划时，工人将起主要作用……他们将直接参加企业的管理。”
    近年来，越南的工人们不仅学会了手执武器与敌人斗争，而且还学会了组织企业及领导它们。每个工厂中都创立了工人委员会。许多国营及合作企业（这种企业占国内企业大部）的领导者都是工人。企业的领导者要在职工会会员面前报告并听取他们关于改善工作的意见。总工会在国家国民经济计划委员会及政府的劳动委员会中都有自己的代表。
    越南的经济计划中，农业发展问题占有重要地位。政府企图根本改变封建的土地使用制度。减租法令，分配公有土地，把法国占领者的土地分配给贫农——这是解决农业问题的第一步。采取了改善农业技术及提高收获的方法。工人扩充着化学肥料与农具的生产。在土地使用根本改变后的结果，越南北部许多区域中耕地面积已达到战前范围，而收获量却超过战前平均收获量之百分之二十五。
    虽然有战争引起的困难，胡志明的民主政府对改善劳动者物质及文化生活条件方面，仍寄与很大的注意。总工会在这方面也做了大量工作。一九四六年十一月越南共和国国民大会批准了由职工会积极参加下拟定的劳动法。劳动法制订了工作周长度的限制，保持原薪的休假，疾病补助费和养老金。反对帝国主义占领者的战争，还暂时妨碍着它的完全实现。工人以对自己责任的高度自觉，响应职工会扩大产品的号召，时常自愿地在下班后仍继续工作。
