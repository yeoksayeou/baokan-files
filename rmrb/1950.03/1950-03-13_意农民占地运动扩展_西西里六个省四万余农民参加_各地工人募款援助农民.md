Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th—TASS, Rome, 10th: The struggle of Italian farm laborers and poor peasants for land is expanding, covering approximately 150 counties in the Calabria region. Police in Reggio Province, Calabria, even used tear gas to disperse occupying farmers. On the island of Sardinia, farmers have occupied 10,000 hectares of idle land. The peasant movement has also expanded to the Venice region and the northern part of the Latium region.

　　In Sicily, the peasant movement has expanded to six provinces, with an estimated 44,000 farmers participating, according to newspapers. The government has dispatched special police forces in an attempt to suppress the farmers in Sicily. At least 43 union leaders of Sicilian farm laborers have been arrested.

　　Various industrial centers in Sicily are raising funds to help the farmers. Fourteen workers' delegations have set out to the countryside to assist them. A feature of this farmer's land occupation movement is the united action of the rural working people under the leadership of the agricultural workers' union and local branches of the Catholic trade union.

    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社罗马十日讯：意大利农场雇工和贫农争取土地的斗争正在扩展，加拉勃利亚区已扩及约一百五十个县。加拉勃利亚区勒佐省的警察，竟用催泪性毒气，来驱散占地的农民。在萨丁岛上，农民们已经占领了一万公顷的闲地。农民运动亦扩充威尼斯区及拉提乌姆区的北部。
    在西西里，农民运动扩展到六个省，据报纸的估计，四万四千农民参加了这个运动。政府已派遣出特别警察部队，企图镇压西西里的农民。最少有四十三名西西里雇农的工会领袖被逮捕。
    西西里各个工业中心均在募集基金，以帮助农民。十四个工人代表团已启程前往乡间援助他们。农村劳动人民在农业工人联合会和天主教工会地方分会的领导下，团结一致地行动，这是这次农民占地运动的一个特点。
