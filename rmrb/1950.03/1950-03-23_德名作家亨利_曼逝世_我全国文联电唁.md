　　Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Renowned German writer Heinrich Mann passed away in the United States on the 12th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent a telegram of condolence upon hearing the news. The telegram reads as follows: We express our deep sorrow at the death of Heinrich Mann. This outstanding German writer fought unyieldingly throughout his life for true peace and democracy, right up to his last breath. The tyranny of the Hitlerite bandits could not intimidate him in the slightest. During his exile, he actively participated in the international anti-fascist front. With his powerful pen, he relentlessly attacked the fascist bandits. His life's work has left a brilliant and militant example for progressive writers around the world in the great cause of striving for lasting peace and people's democracy.

　　德名作家亨利·曼逝世
    我全国文联电唁
    【新华社二十二日讯】德国名作家亨利·曼于十二日在美国逝世，中华全国文学艺术界联合会闻讯后特电致唁。电文如下：对于亨利·曼的逝世，我们沉痛地表示哀悼。这位杰出的德国作家，一生不屈不挠，始终为真正和平与民主而战斗，直到最后的一息。过去希特勒匪徒的淫威丝毫不能吓倒他。他在流亡生活中，仍积极地参加国际反法西斯阵线。凭着他的健笔，给法西斯匪徒以无情的抨击。他一生的劳作，为世界进步作家争取持久和平与人民民主的伟大事业留下了一个光辉的、战斗的范例。
