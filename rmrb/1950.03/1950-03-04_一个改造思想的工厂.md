　　A Factory for Remolding Thought
　　Liang Shan
　　In Dalian, there is a factory that specifically recruits widowers, widows, orphans, and the disabled who are unwilling or unable to work, or who are living in poverty, to work as laborers. The factory's structure is unique; in addition to ironworks, cotton mills, straw weaving, printing plants, orchards, vegetable gardens, rice paddies, pastures, and pickle factories, as well as laundry services, it also has facilities like nursing homes, elementary schools, kindergartens, hospitals, mental asylums, barber shops, bathhouses, and clubs. The name of this factory is the "Persuasion Industry Factory."

　　The factory currently has 1,523 people, of whom about two-thirds are orphans, infants, and the disabled who cannot engage in production. The remaining one-third of the workers were, three or four years ago, vagrants in the old society, such as beggars, thieves, opium addicts, and gamblers, who did not engage in honest labor. These unemployed vagrants have completely changed their original appearance after being taken in and educated by the People's Government. In the past three years or so, the factory has rescued 3,229 people from the fire pit of poverty and degradation, setting them on the right path.

　　Educating and transforming these people was extremely difficult. Due to long-term vagrancy after being abandoned by the old society, they had developed a very strong sense of hooliganism and parasitism. For example, when Jiang Xiyu from the straw weaving factory was being mobilized to work, he pretended to be sick, lying in bed and yelling, and secretly threw away the medicine prescribed by the hospital. When Sui Jiang first started learning to work, he had to go to the toilet more than 20 times a day, and he would disappear – running off to play or sleep elsewhere. The older ones generally had the idea of just muddling along and waiting to die, not wanting to move at all after eating their fill. Sometimes, some people would make unreasonable demands about the food.

　　The main key to changing this situation was to carry out a "speak bitterness" movement among all those who had been taken in. The staff first focused on strengthening education and cultivating activists, finding those among them who had experienced the most suffering in the past to give typical reports, encouraging everyone to "pour out their bitterness," so they could recognize the reasons for their poverty and degradation in the old society. Then, they focused on education in labor production. In this way, they had a preliminary change in their thinking. The original 34 young and middle-aged people who had entered the nursing home successively proposed to go to the factory to produce. Yu Gengyan and others, who usually complained of back and leg pain, automatically organized a miscellaneous work team to load and unload goods for the factory's trucks, carrying loads weighing 180 jin (approximately 90 kilograms).

　　At this time, the next problem was that they lacked the skills and production experience, and their enthusiasm for production was not yet consolidated. To this end, in addition to establishing amateur training classes to continue education on the glory of labor, the factory also established technical training classes and amateur technical research groups, conducting technical education in the factory, and formulating workpoint tables to record each person's daily production achievements, launching production competitions and creating model worker movements to further consolidate and improve their enthusiasm for labor. As a result, the vegetable garden's production enabled the factory to be self-sufficient in vegetables. The cotton mill increased the number of threads watched per person from 30 to 90; and increased from four people watching one weaving machine to an average of one person watching one machine. The straw weaving factory increased production from 30 kilograms of straw rope per person per day to 50 kilograms. The number of people in the factory who initially mastered technology increased from 43 to 91, and 13 people have learned relatively proficient skills. Personnel in the nursing home and women's department all participated in labor such as twisting hemp rope, making shoes, and sewing clothes.

　　Immediately afterwards, the factory leadership mobilized everyone to do accounting, so they could realize that their labor was not enough to supply their own consumption, and told them the truth about being masters of their own house, overcoming the complacency and slackness in their minds, and further improving their labor enthusiasm. For example, more than 50 people on the farm reclaimed 60 mu (approximately 4 hectares) of rice paddies in less than 60 days, cotton weaving workers increased to watching two machines per person (the most watched four machines per person), and cleared 17 mu of vegetable gardens in their spare time, and the nursing home increased shoe production from 13 pairs to 18 pairs per day. At this time, the average production of the factory increased by 20 percent, and their lives gradually improved.

　　In order to develop towards industrialization, last August, the factory workers generally assessed wages and formed 14 learning classes (including culture classes, literacy classes, and technical research classes), and carried out education focused on eliminating illiteracy and mastering technology. Now, except for the old, the young, and the blind and deaf, those who know eight or nine hundred characters account for half.

　　Now many people have been promoted to cadres. Compared with when they were first taken in, they have simply undergone a complete transformation, as if they were different people. For example, Guan Dengkui, who had been a shop assistant and then degenerated into making a living by singing "Lotus Clapper," was initially naughty and lazy when he was taken in, smoked opium and injected morphine, never listened to persuasion, and once instigated those who came with him to "strike." After the "speak bitterness" movement "dug up the roots of poverty" and "poured out their bitterness," he progressed very quickly, not only giving up opium, but also working actively and willingly, and was promoted to deputy director of the nursing home in less than three years. He used his own transformation to persuade many newly admitted people who could not turn their thinking around for a while. Another Li Guichun, who was naughty and mischievous when he was first taken in, was very unwilling when he was sent to work at the cotton mill, saying: "If you ask me to do it, I will give you bad cloth!" But now he is already the chairman of the branch of the factory trade union, and the output and quality of weaving cloth in the whole factory are the strongest, and he also joined the New Democratic Youth League last year. By last year, among the people taken in by the factory, in addition to those who were transferred, 16 have been promoted to work as factory staff, 26 worker cadres and 182 skilled workers have been trained, and more than 300 vagrant children have received formal education.

　　This year during the Spring Festival, the staff of the Persuasion Industry Factory held a lively entertainment party. At the meeting, they used the following song to express their inner joy:

　　Since our Lushun-Dalian established the Persuasion Industry Factory,
　　Vagrant children have a home.
　　From then on, you no longer hear beggars shouting "Mother" on the street,
　　Nor do the suffering people sleep on the roads;
　　The phenomenon of theft has almost disappeared,
　　Engaging in production and learning culture is a new atmosphere.
　　Living improvement, everyone is happy and at ease,
　　This is all thanks to the good advocacy of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

　　一个改造思想的工厂
    梁山
    大连市有一个工厂，那里专门招收不愿做工、不能做工或生活困难的鳏、寡、孤、独者来做工人。这个工厂机构与众不同；除了有铁工、棉织、草织、印刷等厂，和果园、菜园、稻田、牧场、咸菜场、洗衣所以外，还有养老院、小学校、幼稚园、医院、疯人院以及理发馆、澡堂、俱乐部等设备。这个工厂的名字叫做“劝业工厂”。
    全厂现在有一千五百二十三人，其中不能从事生产的孤儿、婴孩和残废者约占三分之二，其余三分之一的工人，在三、四年前，都是旧社会中的乞丐、小偷、烟鬼、赌徒等不务正业的游民。这些无业游民经过人民政府的收容和教育，已完全改变了原来的面貌。三年多来，该厂已经从穷困和堕落的火坑里拯救出了三千二百二十九人，使之走上了正道。
    教育改造这些人曾经是极不容易的事。由于被旧社会遗弃而长期流浪，他们养成了极浓厚的流氓意识与寄生意识。如草织厂的姜喜玉在动员他工作时，就伪装闹病，躺在床上叫嚷，医院给他配的药也偷偷扔了。刚学做工时的隋江，每天总得上便所二十多次，而且一去不见影——跑到别处玩耍或睡觉去了。年龄大一些的，更普遍存在着混吃、等死的思想，吃饱饭根本不想动弹。有时还有些人为了伙食问题无理取闹。
    改变这种情况的主要关键，是在全体被收容人员中进行诉苦运动。工作人员先从抓紧教育与培养积极分子做起，在他们中间找出过去经历最苦的人作典型报告，启发大家“吐苦水”，使他们认识自己在旧社会里受穷和堕落的原因，接着就抓紧进行劳动生产的教育。这样，他们思想上有了初步改变。原先进了养老院的三十四名青壮年纷纷提出要到工厂生产，平时常喊腰痛腿痛的于更言等人，自动组织了杂工组，给工厂的卡车装卸货物，一百八十斤重的东西抬起来就走了。
    这时，接着发生的问题是他们缺乏技术与生产经验，而且生产情绪还不巩固。厂方为此除成立业余性质的训练班，继续进行劳动光荣的教育以外，同时又成立了技术训练班和业余技术研究组，在工厂里进行技术教育，并制订计工表，记录每人每天的生产成绩，开展生产竞赛与创造模范运动，进一步地巩固与提高他们的劳动积极性。结果菜园的生产使全厂蔬菜达到自给。棉织厂由每人看三十个线头，提高到每人看九十个；由四人看一台织布机，提高到平均每人看一台。草织厂由每人每天生产草绳三十公斤提高到五十公斤。全厂初步掌握技术的由四十三名增加到九十一名，并已有十三个人学会了比较熟练的技术。养老院和妇女部人员则全部都参加了捻麻绳、做鞋、缝衣等劳动。
    紧接着工厂领导上又发动大家算账，使他们认识到自己的劳动还不够供给自己消费，告诉他们当家做主人的道理，克服了他们之中存在的自满和懈怠思想，使他们的劳动热情又提高了一步。如农场五十多人在不到六十天内就开出了六十亩稻田，棉织工人提高到每人看两台机器（最多的一人看四台），并抽空开了十七亩菜园，养老院做鞋由每天十三双增加到十八双。这时全厂生产平均提高了百分之二十，他们的生活也逐渐得到了改善。
    为了向企业化发展，去年八月，全厂工人普遍评定了工资，并组成了十四个学习班（其中分文化班、文盲班和技术研究班），进行了以消灭文盲和掌握技术为主的教育。现在除了老、幼和瞎子、哑吧等外，识八、九百字的已占半数。
    现在不少的人已被提拔为干部。他们和刚被收容时比较，简直是脱胎换骨，判若两人。如曾经当过店员以后堕落为靠唱《莲花落》为生的管登奎，开始被收容时又调皮又懒惰，抽大烟扎吗啡，向来不听说服动员，并曾策动同来的人“罢”过工。经过诉苦运动“挖穷根”、“吐苦水”后，他进步非常快，不但戒绝了烟毒，工作也积极肯干，不到三年，已提拔为养老院副院长。他用他自己转变的例子，说服了很多思想上一时转不过来的新被收容的人。另一个开始被收容时调皮捣蛋的李桂春，被送到棉织厂工作时，非常不愿意，说：“叫我干，我就给你们出坏布！”但现在已经是该厂工会的支会主任了，全厂织布的产量和质量都数他强，去年还参加了新民主主义青年团。到去年为止，全厂收容人员中除调走者外，已提拔了十六个作工厂职员，培养了二十六名工人干部和一百八十二名技术工人，并使三百多个流浪儿受到了正规教育。
    今年春节，劝业工厂职工举行了一个热闹的娱乐晚会。在会上，他们用下面这支歌子来表现他们内心的欢欣：
    咱旅大，自从成立劝业工厂，
    流浪的人儿有了家乡。
    从此，再不闻乞儿满街喊大娘，
    也没有，受苦人露宿马路上；
    偷盗的现象几乎绝了迹，
    闹生产，学文化，一派新气象。
    生活改善人人都安乐，
    这都是：共产党、人民政府的好主张。
