　　The economic achievements of enterprises are inseparable from the Party's work in the factories. The fate of the production plan is determined by the role of the factory's Party organization. If the Party organization relies on the Communist Party members, all the workers, engineers, and technicians, it can quickly reflect everything happening in the factory and each team. If the factory's Party organization can correctly arrange its work, it will achieve great success in educating Party members and in all production endeavors.

　　Take the Party organization of the mechanical workshop in the grinding machine factory as an example. Last year, the workshop failed to complete its production plan, which created a serious obstacle to the factory's overall work. This gave the factory's Party committee a great impetus. The Party committee of the factory carefully studied the situation in the workshop, discussed the report of the secretary of the workshop's Party organization, and determined many practical methods to improve the workshop's work and consolidate its many teams. Comrade Dobeijieyev, an enthusiastic worker and Communist Party member, was selected as the chief technician.

　　The Party organization of the workshop gradually strengthened its influence on production. Due to its requirements, the staffing of cadres was re-examined, shortcomings in design were eliminated, and shortcomings in supervising compliance with industrial discipline were eliminated.

　　The Party organization led the socialist competition more forcefully. It revealed not only the work results of each team, but also the work results of each worker during shift changes. The issue of competition was often discussed at production meetings. Communist Party members helped develop new methods of Stakhanovite work and establish genuine mutual assistance. They personally set an example in their work. Comrade Shutov, a blacksmith, and Comrade Mitriyev, a technician, as well as Comrade Yaqimov, the secretary of the Party organization and the factory's best grinding machine worker, and Comrade Yagubov, the deputy secretary and rapid planing machine operator, directly taught young workers next to the machines and passed on their experience to them.

　　The Party organization paid great attention to mass political work, not only absorbing all Communist Party members but also non-Party workers to participate in social work, which played a significant role in raising people's political awareness and enthusiasm. For example, in implementing the work initiated by Mitkihe to improve the products of the field and many other workshops, many team leaders, technicians, and ordinary workers participated due to the call of the Party organization.

　　After the work of the Party organization improved, the workshop began to overfulfill its plan, had regular surplus products, changed from being detrimental to profitable, and had no substandard products for several months.

　　The Party committee in the factory has recently achieved significant improvements in Party work in various workshops. This is reflected in the factory's completion of its production plan. There are no more of the previous blitzes. The plan is overfulfilled month after month. The quality of products has also improved.

　　This is one of many examples that shows how great the role of the factory's Party organization is. The Party's district committee studied this experience and strengthened its leadership over the Party organizations in the factories. This issue became an object of discussion at the plenary session of the district committee. The plenary session passed a resolution, in which the tasks of the Party organizations in the factories and methods of improving leadership were specified.

　　Many secretaries of the Party organizations in the factories are young Party workers. They need constant help. What form does this help take? It is diverse and has no fixed form. For example, in the "Proletarian Labor" factory, the Party committee holds monthly discussion meetings for secretaries and deputy secretaries. The meetings study Party and mass political work and leading economic issues. Not long ago, the issue of preparing to convene a Party meeting was discussed. In the fuel machinery factory, a three-day study class was held to study Party organizational issues, Party political work, and enterprise economics. The Party committee often listened to reports from the Party organizations in the workshops.

　　Experience indicates that, in addition to this, giving local practical help to the activists of the factory's Party organization is particularly important. The district committee requires the staff of the factory's Party committee and Party bureau to spend at least two-thirds of their working time in the factory, to actually help all activities of the factory's Party organization and Party groups.

　　Recently, the Party's district committee has also been closer to the Party organizations in various factories. Their work issues are discussed in the meetings of the district committee bureau. We held meetings for secretaries of different production groups to exchange experiences. At the same time, we informed them of the current tasks of the city and district Party organizations. The instructors and other workers of the district committee often go to the factory. When the Party organization in the factory holds meetings to discuss the most important issues, the instructors of the district committee, leaders of various departments, secretaries, and members usually attend and participate. They help lower-level leaders prepare for and conduct Party meetings. Comrades Seskov, Yazkaievich, Smirnov, and Samosin, instructors of the district committee, paid special attention to the work of the Party organization in the factory.

　　However, the workers of the district committee alone cannot do all these things. Therefore, the district committee absorbs a large number of activists to systematically help the Party organizations in the factories. It guides these activists and tries to make their help truly effective.

　　In order to improve the ideological and political level of the activists and help them study the issues of Party building, a study class was organized under the Party's district committee. Members of the district committee, Party and Communist Youth League activists all study in the study class. The district committee uses the audience of the study class to give practical help to the Party organizations and Party groups in the factories in the enterprises in the district.

　　The district committee implements the resolutions of the Ninth Congress of the Moscow Region and the Eighth Joint Party Congress of Moscow City, and pays more attention to the issue of Party work in the factories. In order to better educate Communist Party members and strengthen their ties with the masses, we should improve the combat effectiveness of the factory's Party organization and further improve the forms and methods of work.

### 领导工场的党组织

　　领导工场的党组织
    莫斯科联共（布）十月区委会书记浦拉托诺夫著
    企业内经济方面的成就和工场里党的工作是分不开的。生产计划的命运决定于工场党组织所起的作用。党组织如果依靠共产党员、依靠所有的工人、工程师和技师们，就能很快地反映出工场和每个小队中的一切事情。如果工场的党组织能够正确地安排自己的工作，那么它就会在教育党员及一切生产事业中获得巨大成就。
    以研磨机工厂中机械场的党组织为例，去年工场没有完成生产计划，形成了全厂工作中的严重障碍，这便给了工厂党组织巨大的督促。工厂中的党局仔细地研究了工场的情况，讨论了工场党组织书记的报告，确定了许多改善工场工作和巩固其许多车间的实际方法。热心的工人——共产党员朵贝皆耶夫同志被选拔为技师长。
    工场的党组织对生产事业逐渐加强的影响。由于它的要求，曾重新审查了干部的配备，铲除了设计中的缺点和在监督遵守工业纪律中的缺点。
    党组织领导社会主义竞赛更加有力。它不仅把每个小队的工作结果，而且把每个工人的工作结果在换班时都揭示出来。在生产会议上常常讨论竞赛的问题。共产党员们帮助发展斯塔哈诺夫工作的新方法，建立真正的互助。他们亲自在工作中做表率。铁匠叔托夫同志和技师的米特里耶夫同志，还有工厂中最好的研磨机工人——党组织书记牙基莫夫同志，和副书记快速平削机手牙古包夫同志，直接在机器旁边教导年青的工人们，把自己的经验传达给他们。
    党组织对于群众政治工作非常注意，不仅吸收一切共产党员而且也吸收非党的工人参加社会性的工作，对于提高人们的政治觉悟和积极性有着不小的作用。如在实行为米特基贺所发起的提高该场和其他许多工场产品的工作中，许多的小队长、技师、和普通工人们由于党组织的号召都参加了。
    当党组织的工作改善之后，工场开始超额完成了自己的计划，有了正规的超额产品，它从有损害的变为有收益的了，它已经几个月来都没有劣等产品了。
    工厂中的党局使近来在各工场中党的工作达到了显著的改善。这表现在工厂完成了生产计划上。这儿已经没有了从前的突击。计划也一月月地超额完成着。产品的质量也提高起来。
    这是许多实例中的一个，它指出了工场党组织的作用是如何巨大。党的区委会研究了这个经验，就加强领导工场的党组织。这个问题成为区委会全会讨论的一个对象。全会通过了一项决议，决议中指定工场内党组织的任务和改善领导的方法。
    工场党组织中的许多书记是年青的党的工作者。他们需要经常的帮助。这种帮助是什么形式的呢？是多种多样的，没有一定形式的。例如在“无产阶级的劳动”工厂中，党局每月都进行书记和副书记的讨论会。会上研究党内的和群众政治工作及领导经济问题，不久以前曾讨论了关于准备召开党的会议的问题。在燃料机器工厂中举行了为期三天的研究班，研究党的组织问题、党的政治工作和企业的经济等问题，党委会时常听取工场党组织的报告。
    经验指出，除此而外，对工场党组织的积极分子给与当地的实际帮助是特殊重要的。区委会使工厂内党委会和党局的工作人员要至少以其三分之二的工作时间在工场中渡过，要实际上去帮助工场党组织和党组的一切活动。
    近来党的区委会也更靠近各工场的党组织了。它们的工作问题在区委会局的会议中讨论。我们举行了各别不同生产组书记的会议，一方面交流经验，同时我们通知他们城市和区的党组织的当前任务。区委会的指导者和其他工作者时常到工场去。当工场党组织开会讨论最重要的问题时，区委会的指导者、各部领导人、书记和委员们通常都出席参加。他们帮助低级领导者们来准备和进行党的会议。区委会的指导者塞斯科夫、雅兹开维奇、斯米尔诺夫、萨莫新诸同志，都对于工场党组织的工作特别注意。
    但是只靠区委会的工作者们是不能做这所有的事情的。因此区委会吸收大量积极分子来有系统地帮助工场的党组织。它指导这些积极分子，尽力使他们的帮助是真正有效的。
    为了提高积极分子的思想政治水平，帮助他们研究党的建设问题，在党的区委会下组织了研究班，区委会的委员，党的和共青团的积极分子们都在研究班中学习。区委会借研究班的听众对区内企业中工场的党组织和党组给与实际的帮助。
    区委会实现莫斯科州第九次和莫斯科城市第八次联席党代表会议的决议，对于工场中党的工作问题，更加注意了。为了更好地教育共产党员加强和群众的联系，应该提高工场党组织的战斗性，把工作的形式和方法更加完善起来。
