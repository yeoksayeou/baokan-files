To the Editor:

　　Having read the *Xinwen Ribao* editorial "Correctly Solving the Marriage System Problem" today, which states: "Our party members and cadres should absolutely not support the feudal marriage system, and should absolutely not 'suppress' the women's liberation struggle. Cadres and party members who hold such erroneous views should be corrected politically, and those who violate the law as a result should be sanctioned by law," I am filled with admiration. I hope you will continue your efforts to eliminate the feudal marriage system, which is not only the glory of your newspaper, but also the honor of the women's community.

　　读《正确解决婚姻制度问题》后编辑同志：
    今天见新闻日报刊登贵报社论《正确解决婚姻制度问题》所云：“我们的党员和干部绝对不应该拥护封建的婚姻制度，绝对不应该‘镇压’妇女的解放斗争。凡持这样错误观点的干部和党员，在政治上应当受到纠正，其有因此而犯法者，并且应当受法律的制裁”等语，阅读之下，不胜钦敬。尚望继续努力，以达消灭封建婚姻制度之目的，此非特贵报之光，实妇女界之荣幸也。
