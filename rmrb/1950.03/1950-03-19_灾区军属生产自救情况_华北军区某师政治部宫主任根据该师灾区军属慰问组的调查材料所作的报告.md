　　Situation of Military Dependents in Disaster Areas Engaging in Production for Self-Relief
	Report by Director Gong of the Political Department of a Certain Division of the North China Military Region, Based on the Investigation Materials of the慰问 Group of Military Dependents in Disaster Areas of the Division
	I. Living Conditions of Disaster Victims and Military Dependents

	The three慰问 groups unanimously reflected that the living conditions of the general masses in the disaster areas are: severely difficult. The main food of the disaster victims is grass seeds, grain husks, bran, wild vegetables, corn kernels, sorghum caps, etc., with coarse grains accounting for only 30%, so most of them are sallow and emaciated.

	This is not just a problem of a few families, but a social problem. Military dependents are part of the masses, so their lives are also difficult. However, according to the reports of the three慰问 groups, the lives of military dependents are still better than those of the general masses. This is because military dependents not only enjoy preferential military grain, but also have priority for disaster relief grain, loan grain, loans, and seed loans; at the same time, it is also because the government attaches greater importance to organizing production for self-relief among military dependents in disaster areas. Before the Spring Festival, the Tianjin Special District allocated 100,000 catties of grain for military dependents to use during the festival (other special districts also did this). In Liu Yuan Village, Third District, Dacheng County, out of a hundred households, the government once distributed 250 catties of relief grain, and except for one extremely poor worker's family that received 15 catties, the rest were given to seven families of martyrs and military dependents. In Yuerzhuang, Qing County, the government loaned wheat seeds for 343.8 mu of land, and military dependents received 44 mu, accounting for 13% of the total, but the number of military dependent households only accounted for 4% of the village. Han Delu's family, from the health team of the 616th Regiment, planted 10 mu of wheat, and the seeds were all loaned by the government, totaling 120 catties.
	Liu Wencheng, deputy squad leader of the Sixth Company of the 617th Regiment, is from Xidiantou Village, Anxin. His father suffers from tuberculosis, and his mother has severe eye disease due to difficult living conditions. In the past, they relied solely on a stone mill at home, sweeping the "bottom of the mill" every day to maintain their livelihood. Later, after government relief, they received 50 catties of preferential military grain and 10 taels of relief grain per person per day, which will be issued until July of this year; in addition, his family has two mu of reeds, and his mother's eye disease has recovered. She can weave one mat a day, totaling 30 mats per month, which can be exchanged for 210 catties of red grain from the county supply and marketing cooperative. The old lady said, "By the time the wheat is harvested this year, there will be no problem with the family's livelihood."
	The disaster situation in Dongdingli, Wenan, is more severe. During the Gregorian New Year, the villagers automatically donated 30,000 yuan to the most difficult military dependents. Although the money is small, the spirit of supporting the military can be seen in general at a time when the lives of disaster victims are so difficult.
	The Dacheng Home for the Disabled and Elderly houses a total of 135 people, of whom 57 are families of martyrs and military dependents.
	The above examples can illustrate how the families of revolutionary soldiers are being cared for and loved by the government and the people.
II. How does the government lead production and relief?

	The most important way to overcome disasters is for the government to lead disaster victims in production for self-relief. Now, local cadres in the disaster areas, except for a few comrades who must remain in the organs, are going deep into the countryside to organize the masses to produce. Counties, districts, and villages have all organized supply and marketing cooperatives to supply disaster victims with production materials, purchase finished products, and sell daily necessities, providing strong assistance to the masses in their lives and production.
	The government has organized various productions according to the different characteristics of different regions and the habits and production conditions of the masses. Dacheng County mobilized disaster victims to boil saltpeter. The district party secretary of the Second District personally convened saltpeter miners to discuss their experiences. If someone didn't know how, the government helped find someone to teach them. After the snowfall last winter, the saltpeter miners passively waited for the snow to melt. The government immediately pointed out the error of waiting and led the masses to sweep the snow, and saltpeter production quickly resumed. Comrade Wang Jian, deputy political instructor of the reconnaissance company of our division, is from Dongxinzhuang, Sixth District, Dacheng. His family has twelve members. They boil two pots of saltpeter a day, each pot producing 13 catties of saltpeter. They send one person to Tianjin to sell it and exchange it for corn to support the family with thin porridge and vegetables. Recently, the government gave his family another 90 catties of red grain.
	Women in the Anxin area mostly weave mats, and the government purchases the finished products. According to investigations, each person can weave one mat a day, which can be exchanged for one dou of red grain from the county supply and marketing cooperative, enough to feed ten people. In the Gaoyang area, many people make a living by weaving cloth. The supply and marketing cooperative provides loans and thread loans to support production. To solve the difficulties of inconvenient transportation after the ice melts, it prepaid weaving households with two months' worth of thread and wage rice. Dongzhaofu Village in Gaoyang County originally had 49 looms, and with government support, it increased to 106. Each loom produces one bolt of cloth per day, enough to support the lives of 15 people. The village also organized 25 small carts for transportation, and all the villagers are engaged in production. Most of the villagers' food is grain, and their lives are relatively good.
	The masses in the Baiyangdian area are experienced in fishing. The masses in various places have organized more than a hundred methods to catch fish for a living. For example, in Hezhuangzi, Anxin County, more than 40 people caught eight *hu* of fish (approximately 2,500 catties per *hu*) in 40 days, which can be exchanged for more than 14,000 catties of corn. A "large net" team of more than 30 people can process about 800 catties of fish per day, and each person can get more than 10 catties of coarse grain, enough to feed five people. Even those with poor skills can maintain their livelihoods.
	For the orphans, widows, elderly, weak, disabled, helpless, and unable to produce, the government provides subsidies in kind, with the slogan "No one will starve to death." Since the disaster in Anxin County, 340,000 catties of relief grain have been distributed, including 35,000 catties of preferential military grain, which was given to the families of martyrs and military dependents. Those under 11 years old and over 65 years old are eligible, with 30 catties given to one person per household, 25 catties per person for two people, 20 catties per person for three people, and a total of 72 catties per household for four or more people. The families of martyrs and military dependents have priority in the distribution of relief grain under the same conditions as the general masses, with 10 taels of rice per person per day, issued until July of this year or the wheat harvest.
	According to the report of the Tianjin Special District慰问 group, homes for the disabled and elderly have been established in Dacheng, Wenan, and Jinghai to house elderly, young, disabled people who are unable to produce and have no one to care for them. The government sent five cadres to be responsible for organizing production, managing meals, and conducting education. Now most of them are also participating in production: such as picking firewood, spinning thread, weaving straw hat braids, weaving earth baskets, weaving "roof covers", and opening flour mills. With the income from production plus the ten taels of rice per person per day issued by the government, their lives are better than those of the general disaster victims.
	Many places in the Cangxian Special District have established porridge factories.
III. The Hardworking and Responsible Work Style of Government Workers

	Disaster relief through production is a very arduous task. In order to ensure that no disaster victim starves to death, government workers are running around day and night, working tirelessly.
	The county magistrate of Gaoyang County led cadres to go deep into the disaster areas, live with the disaster victims, eat chaff and vegetables. When the village wanted to find rice to cook separately, he politely declined.
	Cadres from counties and districts such as Cangxian, Anxin, and Dacheng carry rice and firewood on their backs when they go to the countryside, and drink salt water as vegetables. They are on a contract system, with 120 catties of rice per month. After saving four catties, 75 catties of rice are allocated for food (their food is lower than the living standards of our soldiers), and the remaining 40 catties are not spent or used by themselves, but are used to subsidize their families. The government does not issue preferential treatment grain to workers' families.
	Section Chief Wei of the Civil Affairs Department of Cangxian County, in coordination with the慰问 group, went to the countryside and checked the names of the disaster victims in the village who had no means of living, writing them on the walls of the neighborhood cadres and asking them to run to each household every day to organize their production. Whoever's district has people starving to death will be held responsible.
	It is said that two people died in Anxin County. After the government received the news, the county and district immediately sent people to check in person. After seeing that there was still dry food in the deceased's house, proving that they had indeed died of illness, it was considered okay. This shows how precious the people's government considers the life of every compatriot. Disaster victims in the Dacheng area said to the comrades of our慰问 group: "We have never seen such a severe disaster in the past two or three decades. Fortunately, the government has led us well, otherwise, who knows how many people would have starved to death?!"
IV. The Ability to Overcome Disasters by Working Diligently and Thrifting

	According to the report of the慰问 group, many family members have excessively high demands on the government or have a mentality of dependence, which requires us to mobilize soldiers to mobilize family members to actively engage in production and strive to be model military dependents. Facts have proved that military dependents in disaster areas who work diligently and thriftily can overcome disasters; those who are lazy and cannot actively engage in production have more difficult lives. Comrade Liu Cheng of the 617th Regiment is from Donglaladi Village, Anxin County. His mother is over forty years old, his younger sister is thirteen years old, and his younger brother is eleven years old. The whole family lives frugally. His mother weaves mats, and buying reeds from others can bring in two or three catties of grain a day. In addition to the little grain the family had saved in the past, they can maintain a minimum standard of living. This year, the government subsidized his family with 50 catties of grain. His mother said: "With the help of the government, and my family not being idle, there will be no problem with our livelihood!" Chen Wanxiang, deputy squad leader of the machine gun company of the 618th Regiment, is from Xiwandeng Village, Sixth District, Dacheng. His family has his father, mother, wife, two younger brothers, and a younger sister, a total of six people. Last autumn, they only harvested a little more than two *shi* of grain, but because the whole family had made long-term plans, they ate less and saved more. The whole family wove straw sandals, his father pushed a cart to sell them in non-disaster areas, and his younger brother worked with others to open a flour mill, earning *zha zi* to eat. The whole family was able to maintain their livelihood. His father said to the comrades of the慰问 group: "We are never idle, we can't eat well, but we won't starve." His family's life is average in the village.
	As for Li Wanchun of the guard battalion, who reported that his house had collapsed and his life was difficult, an investigation revealed that he only had one wife at home, who was in her prime, and often stayed at her mother's house, sometimes coming to the team. The windows at home were not even papered, and she didn't like to work. In reality, only seven or eight *chi* of the courtyard wall had collapsed. Last year, they harvested more than 70 bundles of reeds, which were still leaning against the back of the house, and harvested three bags of wheat. If the woman worked hard to weave mats, her life would definitely be prosperous. This is in stark contrast to the two examples above.

　　灾区军属生产自救情况
    华北军区某师政治部宫主任根据该师灾区军属慰问组的调查材料所作的报告
    一、灾民灾属生活状况
    灾区一般群众的生活状况，三个慰问组一致的反映是：严重困难的。灾民主要食料是草籽、谷皮、麸子、野菜、棒子核、高粱帽等，粗粮仅占十分之三，所以他们多是面黄肌瘦。
    这不是个别人家的问题，而是社会问题，军属是群众的一部分，所以他们的生活也是困难的。但是据三个慰问组的报告，军属还是比较一般群众生活要好一些的。因为军属除享有优军粮外，对赈济粮、贷粮、贷款、贷种等均有优先权；同时，也因为政府对组织灾区军属的生产自救工作更为重视的缘故。春节前天津专区曾拨粮十万斤，为军属过节时用（其他专区也有）。大城县三区刘院庄，百户人家，有一次政府发赈济粮二百五十斤，除一家极贫的工属领得十五斤外，其余都发给了七户烈、军属。青县鱼儿庄，政府贷给三百四十三亩八分地的麦种，军属即得了四十四亩的，占全数的百分之十三，但军属的户数只占全村的百分之四。六一六团卫生队韩德禄家种了十亩麦子，种籽都是政府贷给的，共一百二十斤。
    六一七团六连副班长刘文成，安新西店头村人，其父痨病，母因生活困难眼病较重，过去只靠家里一盘石磨，天天扫“磨底”维持生活，后经政府救济优军粮五十斤，赈济粮每人每日十两，发到今年七月份；加上他家有苇子二亩，母亲眼病痊愈，每日可织席一领，每月共可织席三十领，交给县供销社可换红粮二百一十斤。老太太说：“到今年麦收，全家生活没问题了。”
    文安东町里灾情较重，过阳历年时，村里群众还自动捐献人民币三万元，给了最困难的军属。钱虽少，但在灾民生活如此艰苦之时，其优军精神可见一般。
    大城残老院共收容一百三十五人，其中烈、军属即占五十七人。
    以上这些例子，可以说明革命军人家属是如何受着政府和人民的照顾与爱护。
  二、政府怎样领导生产和救济的？
    战胜灾荒最主要的办法是：政府领导灾民生产自救。现在灾区地方干部，除少数同志必须留在机关外，都深入农村，组织群众生产。县、区、村都组织了供销社，供给灾民生产原料，收购成品，销售日常必需品，给予群众生活上、生产上以有力帮助。
    政府根据不同地区的不同特点及群众习惯、生产条件，组织了各种生产。大城县发动了灾民熬硝。二区区委书记亲自召集硝民座谈经验，有人不会，政府帮助找人教。去冬降雪后，硝民消极等待雪化，政府立即指出等待思想的错误，带领群众扫雪，熬硝生产又很快开展起来了。我师侦察连副政指王健同志，大城六区东辛庄人，家有十二口，一天熬硝两锅，每锅出硝十三斤，派一人到天津去卖，换回玉米来，全家糠糠菜菜可维持生活。最近政府又给他家九十斤红粮。
    新安地区妇女大都会织席子，政府收购成品，据调查每人每日可织席一领，交县供销社可换红粮一斗，能养活十人。高阳地区，多以织布为生，供销社贷款、贷线扶助生产，为解决冰解后交通不便的困难，提前发给织布户两个月的线和工资米，高阳县东赵甫村原有织布机四十九架，在政府扶植下增到一百零六架，每张机子每日出布一匹，能维持十五人的生活。该村还组织了二十五辆小车作运输，全村群众都投入生产中。村民食料大部是粮食，生活较好。
    白洋淀地区群众，富有捕鱼经验，各地群众组织了百余种方法捕鱼为生，如安新县河庄子，四十余人四十天得鱼八扈（每扈约二千五百斤），共可换玉米一万四千余斤。一个拉“大网”班，三十余人每日约治鱼八百斤，每人可得粗粮十余斤，能养五口人，技术低劣者也能维持生活。
    对孤、寡、老、弱、有残疾、无依无靠又无力生产者，政府以实物补助，口号是“不饿死一个人”。安新县受灾以来，发放救济粮三十四万斤，其中有优军粮三万五千斤，发给了烈、军属。十一岁以下，六十五岁以上者有享受权，一户一人发三十斤，二人者每人二十五斤，三人者每人二十斤，四人以上者一户共七十二斤。救济粮的发放，烈、军属与一般群众在同样条件下，有优先权，每人每天米十两，发至今年七月份或麦收。
    根据天津专区慰问组报告，大城、文安、静海都已建立残老院，收容老少残废无力生产、无人照管的人。政府派五个干部负责组织生产，管理伙食，进行教育。现在他们大部也都参加了生产：如拾柴、纺线、编草帽辫、编土篮子、编“盖顶”、开粉坊。生产收入加上每人每日政府发给的十两米，他们的生活比一般灾民还好。
    沧县专区很多地方设了粥厂。
  三、政府工作人员的艰苦负责的作风
    生产救灾是一件很艰巨的工作，政府工作人员为使灾民没有一个人饿死，日夜奔波，不辞劳苦。
    高阳县县长带领干部深入灾区，和灾民生活在一起，吃糠吃菜，村里要找米另作饭，都被他婉言谢绝了。
    沧县、安新、大城等县县区干部，下乡时自己背米背柴，喝盐水当菜，他们是包干制，每月一百二十斤米，节约四斤外，摊伙食七十五斤米（他们的伙食低于我们战士生活），剩下的四十斤，自己不花不用，补助家里，政府对工属则不发优待粮。
    沧县民政科魏科长，协同慰问组下乡，检查出村里生活无着的灾民，就把名字写在小区干部的墙上，让他们每天去各家跑一趟，组织他们生产，谁的区有饿死人，谁负责任。
    据说安新县死过两个人，政府得到消息后，县、区急速派人亲去检查，后见死者屋内尚有干粮，证明确系病死，才算没事，由此可见人民政府对每个同胞的生命是万分珍贵的。大城地区灾民对我慰问组同志说：“二三十年来也没有见过这么重的灾荒，幸亏政府领导的好，要不，不定饿死多少人呢？！”
  四、全家劳动克勤克俭即能战胜灾荒
    根据慰问组报告，不少家属存在着对政府要求过高，或依赖思想，这就需要我们发动战士，动员家属积极生产，争取做模范军属。事实证明灾区军属，全家劳动克勤克俭者，即能战胜灾荒；好吃懒做，不能积极生产，生活则较困难。六一七团刘成同志，安新县东拉拉地村人，母亲四十余岁，妹妹十三岁，弟弟十一岁，全家省吃俭用，母亲织席，买别人的苇子每天也能进二、三斤粮食，加上家里过去节余下的一点粮食，可以维持最低生活，今年政府又补助他家五十斤粮，母亲说：“有政府帮助，我一家不拾闲，生活不成问题了！”六一八团机炮连副班长陈万祥，大城六区西万登村人，家有父、母、妻，两个弟弟，一个弟妹，共六口人，去年秋天仅收两石多粮食，但因全家早作长期打算，少吃省用，全家编草鞋，父亲推小车去非灾区卖，弟弟和人插伙开粉坊，赚渣子吃，全家生活得以维持，其父对慰问组同志说：“我们一身不闲，吃的强不了，可也饿不着。”他家的生活在村里是中等。
    至于警卫营李万春反映家里房倒屋塌，生活困难，经调查他家里只老婆一人，是壮年，经常住娘家，有时来队，家里窗户都不糊，也不爱劳动，实际上，只是院墙倒了七、八尺，去年收苇子七十多把，还在房后靠着，收麦子三口袋，如果该妇女好好编席生产，她的生活定很富裕，这和上面两个例子正是个鲜明的对照。
