　　Seventeenth District of Beijing Suburbs Dredges the North Xiao River to Prevent Flooding and Increase Production
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to increase production and prevent flooding, the Seventeenth District of Beijing suburbs has begun dredging the North Xiao River. The North Xiao River is twenty-six li long. Due to years of disrepair and silt accumulation in the riverbed, the river overflowed during last year's continuous heavy rains, flooding 8,578 mu of fertile land on both sides, resulting in significant losses. Based on the needs of the masses and the instructions on flood prevention from higher authorities, the district government decided to carry out a comprehensive dredging project. Using the "work-for-relief" method, more than 1,400 farmers from sixteen administrative villages (all of whom have undergone land reform) were organized and officially started work on March 10. The project is scheduled to be completed in fifteen days. (Construction Section of the Seventeenth District Government)

　　京郊十七区疏浚北小河防涝、增产
    【本报讯】京郊十七区为增加生产，防止涝灾，开始疏浚北小河。北小河长达二十六华里，因年久失修、河道淤塞，去年大雨连绵之际，河水漫溢，两岸八、五七八亩良田被淹，损失很大。该区政府根据群众需要，及上级防涝指示，决定进行全面疏浚。通过用以工代赈方式，组织了十六个行政村的（均已经过土改）农民计一千四百多人，于三月十日正式动工。工程预定十五天完成。（十七区政府建设科）
