　　To Meet Industrial Construction Needs, Tangshan Coal Washery Starts Operation

    [Report from this newspaper] The Tangshan Kailuan Linxi Coal Mine washery (where mixed coal is extracted and then washed to remove impurities such as gangue and stones) started operation last month. The plant was built in 1939 and is the best-equipped modern, motorized, and automated coal washery in the country. During the Kuomintang rule, national industry was depressed, and there was no market for washed coal, so the plant was almost completely shut down. After liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, national construction began, and many industries needed a large amount of high-quality washed coal. The plant formulated a plan to expand production based on the needs of various regions. The current daily coal washing volume is 3,500 tons, and it is expected to increase to 4,500 tons per day in April, and reach 5,000 tons per day in May. The maximum coal washing capacity of the plant's machinery and equipment can reach 7,000 tons per day.

　　适应工业建设需要唐山洗煤厂开工
    【本报讯】唐山开滦林西煤矿洗煤厂（即采出的混合煤，经过洗煤厂，洗去所含之矸子、石头等杂质）已于上月开工。该厂修建于一九三九年，为全国设备最好的近代化电机自动操作洗煤厂。国民党统治时，全国工业不振，洗煤没有销路，该厂几乎完全停顿。解放后在人民政府领导下，全国开始建设，许多工业需要大量质量较好的洗煤，该厂乃根据各地需要，拟订了扩大生产的计划。现每日洗煤量为三千五百吨，预计四月份每日增为四千五百吨，五月份则可达日产五千吨。而该厂机器设备最高洗煤量每日可达七千吨。
