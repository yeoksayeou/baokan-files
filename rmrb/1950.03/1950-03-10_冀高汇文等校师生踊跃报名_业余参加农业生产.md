　　Jihui High School and Other School Teachers and Students Enthusiastically Sign Up
    To Participate in Agricultural Production in Their Spare Time
    [Our Newspaper] Middle school students from schools such as Jihui High School in Beijing will participate in agricultural production in their spare time this semester. This was proposed by Comrade Peng Zhen in his speech celebrating the first anniversary of the liberation of Beijing. The Municipal Government has decided to allocate a number of acres of land in the suburbs for use by various schools in Beijing, and the fruits of production will be used to improve school life. On the 5th, Huiwen Middle School held a production preparatory committee meeting, composed of representatives from the school, the labor union, and the student union, and assigned work. The school's Communist Youth League branch held a mobilization meeting on the 6th. On the 7th, the principal and the chairman of the student union issued a call to all teachers and students, and a signature campaign was launched that day. The students were extremely enthusiastic, believing that this was a good opportunity to participate in practical labor. As of now, more than 1,000 people have signed up, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of students in the school. Faculty and staff are also signing up. The school's production preparatory committee is studying how to specifically organize production matters and plans to hire teachers and students with production knowledge to provide guidance. After receiving a notice from the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education on the 7th, Jihui High School immediately conveyed it and mobilized everyone to participate. Teachers and students responded enthusiastically, and 450 students signed up within two hours, accounting for more than 85% of the school's students.
