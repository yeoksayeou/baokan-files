　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th: The Soviet people commemorated the 82nd anniversary of the birth of the great proletarian writer Gorky on March 28th.

　　Pravda published a commemorative article stating: "In the realm of world art, Gorky is the poet of the working people. Never before has there been an artist in world literature who has depicted labor with such genius and strength as Gorky. Gorky firmly believed in the victory of communism, and he deeply knew that an artist should use all his strength to fight for the lofty ideals of the Bolshevik Party. His insightful remarks on socialist realism have enriched the ideological treasure trove of the engineers of human souls. Gorky's judgment of the capitalist world was merciless. Even in his early works, he illustrated the decay and stagnation of bourgeois culture. The truthful and cruel pictures of the dying capitalist world depicted in his works are unparalleled in the realm of world art."

　　Izvestia published an article, particularly emphasizing Gorky's role as a loyal fighter for peace, stating: "Gorky's words, 'Capitalists are dangerous people in society,' are even more correct today. Gorky used his genius to expose the face of imperialism and gave a merciless critique of the decadent bourgeois culture. Gorky, with an indignant heart, exposed the warmongers and their lackeys – the Social Democrats."

　　The commemorative article in Labor Daily pointed out: "In his indignant essays, Gorky strongly urged the people of all nations to rise up and fight, and warned against complacency, unprincipled appeasement, and the ostrich philosophy of burying one's head in the sand. Gorky's fiery language has been deeply influencing humanity, helping the unity and ideological development of progressive forces around the world. Today, the United States threatens the world with atomic and hydrogen bombs, with overall diplomacy and new world massacres. The peace-loving people of all countries, headed by the Soviet Union, are closely tightening their ranks, fighting for democracy, peace, and against war. In this struggle, they will use Gorky's immortal, fiery language as a weapon that will never be outdated or dulled."

　　According to statistics from the All-Soviet Publishing Bureau, Gorky's works have been printed in the Soviet Union in 69 languages, with approximately 52 million copies. The Soviet State Publishing House is preparing to publish a new edition of the thirty-volume complete works of Gorky, which will contain twice as much content as the 1938 edition.

　　伟大的无产阶级作家永垂不朽！
    高尔基诞生八十二周年  苏联各报撰文纪念
    ——他的永生的火一般的语言，将是和平斗争中永远不会陈旧的武器！
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民于三月二十八日纪念伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基诞生的八十二周年。
    真理报刊载纪念专文称：在世界艺术领域中，高尔基是劳动者的诗人。世界文学从来没有一个艺术家像高尔基那样以如此的天才和力量来描写劳动。高尔基坚信共产主义的胜利，他深知，艺术家应以他的一切力量为布尔什维克党的崇高理想而斗争。他的关于社会主义现实主义的精辟言论，丰富了人类灵魂工程师的思想宝库。高尔基对资本主义世界的裁判是无情的。甚至在他早期的作品中，他就说明了资产阶级文化的腐朽与停滞。他的著作所描绘的垂死的资本主义世界中真实与残酷的图画，在世界艺术领域中是无可匹敌的。
    消息报刊载专文，特别强调作为和平的忠诚斗士高尔基的作用称：高尔基说过的“资本家是社会上危险的人”这句话在今天更见正确。高尔基运用他天才的力量来揭露了帝国主义的面目，并且对资产阶级腐朽的文化给了无情的批判。高尔基怀着愤怒的心情暴露了战争贩子及其从仆——社会民主党人。
    劳动报的纪念专文指出：高尔基在他的充满愤懑的论文中，力促一切民族的人民奋起斗争，并且警告不要自满，不要有无原则的绥靖主义以及把脑袋藏在翅膀里的驼鸟哲学。高尔基的火一般的语言，一直在深深地影响着人类，帮助着全世界进步力量的团结和思想上的发展。今天，美国以原子弹和氢弹、以总体外交和新的世界大屠杀来威胁世界。以苏联为首的各国爱好和平的人民，正在严密自己的队伍，为民主、和平和反对战争而斗争。在这个斗争中，他们将运用高尔基的永生的火一般的语言，作为永远不会陈旧和迟钝的武器。
    根据全苏出版局的统计：高尔基的著作在苏联已用六十九种文字印行了约五千二百万册。苏联国家出版局正准备印行新版的三十卷高尔基全集，全集的内容比一九三八年版多两倍。
