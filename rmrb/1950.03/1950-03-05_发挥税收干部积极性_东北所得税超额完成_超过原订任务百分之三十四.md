　　Give Play to the Enthusiasm of Tax Cadres
    Northeast Income Tax Exceeds Target
    Exceeds Original Task by Thirty-Four Percent
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The actual collection of industrial and commercial income tax in various provinces and cities of the Northeast at the end of last year, as of February 15, has exceeded the target by 34.8%. With the exception of Fushun and Benxi cities, all other regions have exceeded the targets given by the Northeast Tax Bureau. The best performing areas were Anshan City, exceeding the target by over 91%, and Liaoxi Province, exceeding the target by 64%. Next were Jilin, Liaodong, and Heilongjiang provinces, all exceeding the target by over 47%. Songjiang Province and Shenyang and Harbin cities exceeded the target by over 11%. The reasons for the better performance this time were: First, the Party and government authorities in various provinces and cities attached importance to tax work, personally mobilizing and educating tax cadres, giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of tax cadres. Second, in tax work, attention was paid to using side investigations and direct audits to break through a large number of false accounts, further grasping the sources of tax revenue, making the burden on taxpayers more fair and reasonable. For example, Zhongfu Company in the water, heating, and gas industry in Andong City initially falsely reported its net profit for the entire last year as only 1.4 billion yuan. After investigation by the city's tax bureau, its actual net profit was over 4.2 billion yuan. However, the actual tax paid at the end of the year was only over 300 million yuan, which was clearly insufficient. This proves that the company made a false report. Third, various localities held merchant mobilization meetings, and merchants gradually raised their awareness after propaganda and education.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Liaodong Provincial Tax Bureau's January figures for direct taxes, indirect taxes, and local taxes entering the treasury (excluding Changbai County) averaged 64.42% above the original plan (excluding in-kind tax tasks). The areas exceeding the plan by the largest margins in the province were Zhuanghe, Liuhe, and Fuxian. Zhuanghe exceeded the original plan by 285%. Next were Hailong, Fengcheng, Xinbin, Andong, Benxi, and Huinan counties, with the highest exceeding by 180% and the lowest reaching 110%. Xinjin, Xiuyan, Haicheng, Xifeng, Liaoyang, Xi'an, Kuandian, and other counties also exceeded the original plan by 61 to 98%. The worst performing county in the province in terms of tax revenue was Jingyu County. Because the county did not attach importance to the collection of grain tax, it only completed 89.62% of the task. The main reasons for exceeding the tax revenue task were that Party and government authorities in various regions strengthened tax leadership, relevant agencies also provided strong assistance, and the masses were mobilized to combat smuggling. For example, the trade union and the Communist Youth League in Andong City mobilized union members, shop assistants, and Communist Youth League members to assist in combating smuggling, which had a great effect. In addition, leading comrades at all levels of the tax bureau attached importance to cash revenue during the peak tax season, and all tax workers actively and conscientiously collected taxes.

### 发挥税收干部积极性  东北所得税超额完成  超过原订任务百分之三十四

　　发挥税收干部积极性
    东北所得税超额完成
    超过原订任务百分之三十四
    【本报讯】东北各省、市去年年末实征工商所得税，截至二月十五日止，已超过任务百分之三四·八。除抚顺、本溪两市外，其余各地均超过东北税务总局所给与的任务。成绩较佳者为鞍山市超过任务百分之九一强与辽西省超过任务百分之六十四。其次为吉林、辽东及黑龙江诸省，均超过任务百分之四十七以上。松江省及沈阳、哈尔滨两市超过任务百分之十一以上。此次实征成绩较佳之原因：第一，是由于各省市党政当局重视税收工作，亲自动员教育税收干部。发挥了税收干部的积极性与创造性。第二，在税收工作中注意了利用侧面调查与正面查账，突破大批假账，进一步掌握了税源，使纳税者负担较为公平合理。如安东市水道暖汽业中孚公司开始假报去年全年纯益仅十四亿元。经该市税局调查结果，其实际纯益为四十二亿元以上。而年末实征税额，仅三亿余元，实属不重。证明该公司系谎报。第三，各地均曾召开商人动员大会，商人经过宣传教育后觉悟逐渐提高。
    【本报讯】辽东省税务局一月份直接税、间接税及地方税入库数字（内缺长白县）平均超过原计划百分之六十四点四二（不包括征实任务）。全省超过最多者为庄河、柳河、复县。庄河超过原计划百分之二百八十五。其次为海龙、凤城、新宾、安东、本溪、辉南等县，超过最多者为百分之一百八十，少者亦达百分之一百一十。新金、岫岩、海城、西丰、辽阳、西安、宽甸等县，也已超过原计划百分之六十一至九十八不等。全省税收最差者为靖宇县。该县因未重视征收粮食税，所以仅完成任务百分之八十九点六二。税收任务超过的主要原因，系各地党政加强了税收领导，各有关机关亦大力协助，并发动了群众缉私。如安东市工会，青年团等，动员工会会员、店员、青年团员协助缉私，收到很大效果。另外，则由于各级税局领导同志重视了旺季税收的现金收入，以及全体税务工作人员积极认真征收。
