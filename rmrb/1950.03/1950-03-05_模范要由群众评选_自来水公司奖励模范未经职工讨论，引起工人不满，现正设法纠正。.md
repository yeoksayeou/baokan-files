　　Model Workers Should Be Elected by the Masses
    The Self-Running Water Company's rewards for model workers were made without discussion by the workers, causing dissatisfaction among the workers, and efforts are now being made to correct this.
    [Beijing News] Recently, the Self-Running Water Company’s rewards for model workers did not follow the mass line. The list of model workers was decided solely by the factory management committee, without discussion and election by the masses, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. The company's trade union, after discovering this deviation, is now working to correct it.
    In order to commend employees who contributed to production last year, the company's trade union began collecting materials in January and drafted a preliminary list of twenty-two people. When the factory management committee met on February 14, Liu Zhenfu, the company's manager, also presented a list based on the opinions of the heads of various departments and the materials collected by the administrative side. The management committee combined the administrative and trade union lists and decided to commend and reward forty-two people, including four first-class model workers, four second-class model workers, fourteen third-class model workers, and twenty fourth-class model workers. It was also decided to present awards to the first, second, and third-class model workers and commend the fourth-class model workers at a get-together on the 19th. This list was not only not elected by the masses, but some of the individuals on it were not carefully considered. For example, the person in charge of the Dongzhimen Water Plant proposed six model workers at the meeting, but the next day, he called to replace two of them. The management committee's decision was not announced within the company, and the trade union did not initiate group discussions. Only the Dongzhimen Water Plant read out the list of model workers when reporting the content of the management committee to the workers. At that time, the workers had objections. One foreman proposed by the administrative side was considered a model worker simply because he "played a leading role." Old worker Liu Guisheng said, "Of course, the foreman should play a leading role. Can he be a model worker just based on that?" Other workers also had objections to certain model workers. When the trade union leader heard these reactions, he realized the mistake of not having mass discussions for this round of model worker awards. On the evening of the 16th, he went to consult with Manager Liu Zhenfu and temporarily decided to only award the four first-class model workers with the most outstanding achievements on the 19th, and the remaining model workers would be discussed later. The preparations for the get-together on the 19th were also inadequate. A notice was issued on the 16th stating that a get-together would be held on the 19th (the Spring Festival holiday began on the 17th), without sufficient deliberation or informing everyone that model workers would be commended at the get-together. Only a little over two hundred of the factory's four hundred employees attended the meeting. The trade union sent two trucks to pick up employees from the Dongzhimen Water Plant, but only a dozen people came. After the awards were given to the four first-class model workers, the masses reflected that there was no problem with these four being elected as model workers because of their good production performance, and they were all convinced. The problem is why we weren't told when selecting model workers. The Party, government, and trade union leaders of the company have made self-criticisms for this serious mistake of being divorced from the masses. The Standing Committee of the trade union has decided to convene an executive committee and group leader meeting soon to specifically study this issue and find ways to correct it.

　　模范要由群众评选
    自来水公司奖励模范未经职工讨论，引起工人不满，现正设法纠正。
    【北京讯】自来水公司最近奖励模范因不走群众路线，没有由群众讨论推选，只是由工厂管理委员会决定了模范名单，引起工人的不满。该公司工会发现这个偏向后，正在设法纠正。
    该公司工会，为了表扬去年对生产有贡献的职工，在一月里就开始搜集这类材料，并拟定了一个二十二人的初步名单。工厂管理委员会在二月十四日开会时，该公司经理刘珍甫根据各部门负责人的意见和行政方面搜集的材料，也提出一份名单。管委会综合行政和工会这两份名单，就决定了要表扬和奖励的有四十二个人，其中，一等模范四人，二等模范四人，三等模范十四人，四等模范二十人。并决定在十九日联欢会上，对一、二、三等模范发奖，对四等模范表扬。这个名单，不仅不是群众讨论选出的，而且其中有些人根本没经过慎重考虑，如东直门水厂负责人在会上提出了六个模范，到第二天，又打电话换掉两个。管委会的这个决定，并没有在公司里公布，工会方面也没发动小组讨论，只有东直门水厂在向工人报告管委会内容时，把模范名单念了一遍。当时工人们就有意见。行政方面提出的一个领班，当模范的原因只是“起带头作用”。老工人刘桂生说：“领班的当然得起带头作用，凭这个就能当模范？”其他工人对某些模范也有意见。工会负责人听到这些反映，发觉了这次奖模范没经过群众讨论的错误，就在十六日晚去找刘珍甫经理商议，临时决定十九日只发给成绩最显著的一等模范四个人，其余的模范，以后再讨论。十九日举行的联欢会，准备得也不够。在十六日才出布告说十九日举行联欢会（十七日开始春节放假），既没经过充分的酝酿，也没有告诉大家在联欢会上要表扬模范。开会时全厂四百多人出席的只有二百多人。工会派两辆卡车去接东直门水厂的职工，结果只来了十几个人。会上发奖给四个一等模范后，群众反映说：这四个人生产成绩好当选模范，没有问题，我们都服气。问题是为什么选模范不叫我们知道。该公司党、政、工负责人对这次严重脱离群众的错误已提出检讨。工会常委会决定最近召开执委会和小组长会议，专门研究这个问题，设法纠正。
