Inquiries and Answers

　　Zhang Qi, Shu Jun:
    Regarding your letter asking "Do employees of private businesses and institutions have the right to severance pay?" and "If a person is dismissed, can they enjoy year-end bonuses or rewards?", I briefly reply as follows:
    If public and private factories and businesses dismiss workers or staff due to production or work needs, those with provisions in collective contracts and labor contracts can be handled according to the provisions; those without provisions should be given appropriate severance pay at the discretion of the employer. The amount of severance pay should be determined based on the business conditions of the factory or enterprise and the length of time the employee has worked in the enterprise, but it should not be less than half a month's actual salary and should not exceed three months' actual salary. However, this does not apply to seasonal workers, temporary workers, and workers or staff who are dismissed due to negligence. As for the year-end bonus issue, it depends on the timing of the dismissal and the agreement between labor and management at the time of dismissal. If there is an agreement at the time of dismissal, it can be handled according to the agreement; if the dismissal has been a long time ago and there was no agreement at that time, then old accounts should not be pursued. Every employed worker should have their own organized trade union, and should seek the union's help when problems arise. The procedure for resolving labor disputes is that initially, both parties can negotiate; if negotiation fails, the Labor Bureau (or the Civil Affairs Section of the local People's Government) will mediate; if it still cannot be resolved, the arbitration committee organized by the Labor Bureau can conduct arbitration as a last resort.

　　职工有无享受解雇金和年终奖金的权利张气  舒君：
    来信问“私商与机关生产的员工有无享受解雇金的权利”和“年终奖金或酬劳费，被解雇的人能否享受”的问题简复如下：
    公私厂商为了生产或工作上的需要而解雇工人或职员，在集体合同及劳动契约上有规定者，可按规定办理；无规定者，应酌情发给劳方若干遣散费。至于遣散费之多寡，应视工厂企业之营业情况，与职工在本企业工作时间之长短而定，最低不得少于半个月的实际工资；最高不得超过三个月的实际工资。但季节性工人、临时工人及工人职员因过失而被解雇者，则不在此例。至于年终奖金的问题，须看解雇的时间短暂及在解雇时劳资双方的协定而定。如在解雇时有协定，可按照协定办理；如被解雇已久，且当时并无协定者，则不应追算老账。每个在业职工都应该有自己组织的工会，有事应当找工会来办。劳资争议解决之程序，最初可由双方协商；协商不成，由劳动局（或当地人民政府民政科）调解；如果还不能解决，最后可由劳动局组织的仲裁委员会进行仲裁。
