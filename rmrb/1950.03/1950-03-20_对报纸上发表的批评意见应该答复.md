　　To the Editorial Staff:
    From March 9th to today (March 17th), the People's Daily has published seventeen letters from readers. From these letters, it appears that the people are very concerned about the various tasks of our country.
    I have registered the readers' letters separately. Among the seventeen letters, except for Comrade Zhao Guijiang's "Telephone Work Needs Improvement" (March 9th), which has been answered by the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau – "Procedures for Installation and Relocation of Telephones are Being Improved" (March 13th) – the rest have not yet been answered. I believe that, under the call of your newspaper and the demands of the readers, the relevant departments will definitely conduct a good review and study, and provide replies and explanations.
    I hope that your newspaper can, within a reasonable time, compile and publish a statistic of the letters that have not yet been answered, to draw the attention of the relevant departments.
    Postal Remittance Bureau Staff, Chen Buxiang

  Comrade Buxiang:
    Thank you for your urging. We have decided to accept your suggestion.

　　对报纸上发表的批评意见应该答复编辑同志：
    从三月九日到今天（十七日）为止，人民日报已发表了十七封读者来信，从这些信中看来，人民对自己国家的各种工作，都是很关心的。
    我把读者来信分别登记，在十七封信中，除了赵桂江同志的“电话工作要改进”（三月九日）已由北京电信局解答——“装移电话手续已在改进”外（三月十三日），其余尚未答复。我相信各有关部门在贵报的号召和读者的要求下，一定能好好检讨、研究，给以答复和解释。
    希望贵报在相当时间，能把来信中尚未答复的，统计发表，引起有关部门注意。邮汇局职员  陈步湘
  步湘同志：
    感谢您的督促。您的建议我们决定接受。
