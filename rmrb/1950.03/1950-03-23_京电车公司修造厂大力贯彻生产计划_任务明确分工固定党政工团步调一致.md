　　Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory Vigorously Implements Production Plan:
    Tasks Clearly Defined, Division of Labor Fixed, Party, Government, Labor Union, and Youth League Moving in Step
    [This newspaper reports] Reporter Cheng Min reports: The Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League are moving in step, leading workers to formulate and strive to achieve this year's production plan. Due to clear tasks and reasonable division of labor, significant achievements have been made in January and February. This year, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry, in order to meet the needs of the general public, requires the tram company to increase from an average of 68 trams per day last year to 97 trams per day. According to this requirement, the tram company stipulates that the factory's annual task is: to build 18 new trams, thoroughly overhaul 12 locomotives and 12 trailers, and conduct medium repairs on 12 vehicles. Compared with last year's total project, this is an increase of 50 percent. The Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of the factory, in order to unify steps and ensure the completion of the task, convened an enlarged meeting of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League in early January, absorbing relevant technical personnel to participate, earnestly discussed how to formulate a specific plan, and established two groups for drafting a production plan and a management plan. The production plan group, based on the number of new construction, overhaul, medium repair, and daily repair vehicles stipulated for the whole year, divided the whole year into six phases according to various conditions, with each phase lasting two months, and initially specifically stipulated the task for each phase. And according to the production process and machine efficiency, technical conditions, such as starting with riveters riveting the car disk, then carpenters making the car body, electricians wiring, riveters making the car skin, and overhaul workers making the chassis, the entire schedule was specified, and the completion date of each department was stipulated. The management plan group drafted various systems to ensure the completion of the production plan, such as cost accounting, record statistics, work inspection, standard specifications, work report forms, reward system, production quotas, etc. After the two groups drafted the plan, it was submitted to the joint meeting of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League for revision, and then to the technical personnel and workers of each department for in-depth discussion. After several revisions, it was then finalized.
  Turning the plan into the masses' own
    At the same time, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League began to deploy work separately. The Party and Youth League branches called on Party and Youth League members to formulate individual plans based on the spirit of the draft plan and their own specific conditions, thereby ensuring the completion and exceeding of the factory's production plan this year. At the same time, Party and Youth League members should go deep into the masses, and conduct education focusing on the masses' ideological concerns about ordering plans (such as fear that the task is too heavy to complete, dislike of trouble, fear of doing more work and not being able to distinguish who is good and who is bad, etc.), explaining the importance of ordering plans, and the leadership's acceptance of the experience and lessons of two failed model evaluations in last year's "Hundred Tram Repair Movement", established a performance record system, clearly distinguishing rewards and punishments, and prepared to implement an excess reward system. The Party and Youth League branches proposed that when formulating individual plans, they should focus on producing more, having better quality, abiding by labor discipline, and striving to study and improve technology. During the discussion of the plan, workers raised the problems existing in past production, such as untimely supply of raw materials and insufficient tools, to the administration through the branch, requesting research and solutions. The labor union also convened a meeting of group leaders to mobilize and deploy.
    After a week of deliberation, the ideological concerns of the masses have been basically dispelled. On January 10, the administration convened a general meeting of all employees, announced the production plan, and made a deep review of last year's model evaluation work. After the meeting, group discussions were organized according to production units to formulate individual plans. Because there was preparation in advance, and Party and Youth League members played a leading role, individual plans were successfully formulated within ten days. For individual plans that were not realistic, too many or too few, the group put forward opinions for revision. In the individual annual plan, the January and February plans of general Party and Youth League members have increased by more than 30% compared with the average production task of each phase last year.
    Generally exceeding the original plan by more than 30%
    In the two months after the plan was ordered, the work has made significant progress. Generally, it has exceeded the original plan by more than 30%, and some have increased several times. For example, 19 metalworkers made copper head pieces, which used to be 330 pieces a month, but increased to 835 pieces in January. The rotating worker planing oil pots used to make one a day before ordering the plan, but in January and February, they maintained a record of two a day. The forging worker used to make 40 six-point screws a day, but after clarifying the task, it increased to 65. The car frame class had a daily dispatch task of 92 vehicles in February, and actually completed 96.5 vehicles, an average increase of 4.5 vehicles per day. Doing electric cylinder bumps used to average one a day, and Party member Su Lanbo created a new record of two and a half a day, which stimulated Zhao Wencheng, who is now catching up with the former with a new record of three a day. The reason for the increase in efficiency is mainly that after the plan was ordered, there was a goal to strive for, and the workers worked hard to ensure and exceed the plan, improved their consciousness and enthusiasm, studied and improved technology, and initially launched a labor competition. In addition, in terms of labor organization, the division of labor was general in the past, but now it is specifically determined according to each person's strengths, so that each person can exert their strength; fixing the use of tools and machines has also made them more proficient in their effectiveness and control freely. At the same time, there are also daily work reports, which clearly show the good or bad performance, stimulating everyone's progress; if the efficiency drops sharply, it can also prompt the leadership to study and improve in a timely manner. The main problem that currently exists is that the work of each department is not well connected: after the plan was ordered, individual workers in some departments spontaneously launched a production competition, resulting in an unbalanced development of work between departments, resulting in some units with good production experiencing work stoppages waiting for materials. Therefore, the leadership of the factory must plan to guide the entire factory to a climax of production competition, and promote and ensure the coordinated progress of the work of each department by ordering contract-related methods.
  An important factor in ensuring the implementation of the production plan
    This time, an important factor in the better implementation of the production plan is the consistent pace of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League. Before last winter, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of the factory were not closely connected, each had its own central tasks, and sometimes the heads of the Party, labor union, and Youth League did not even know the production tasks for this month; they did not combine with production, but only engaged in worker education and organizational development. The person in charge of the Party believed that only when the Party's education work was done well and the workers' awareness was raised could production be increased; the Youth League once specialized in youth worker entertainment and even wanted to occupy production time; the labor union could not grasp the center, and lacked planning in addition to giving general education to the workers, so the work was often passive; the administration only looked for engineers, technicians or foremen according to the system, and the production tasks were not discussed by the masses. This, of course, cannot quickly improve production efficiency.

　　京电车公司修造厂大力贯彻生产计划
    任务明确分工固定党政工团步调一致
    【本报讯】记者程敏报道：北京市电车公司修造厂党政工团步调一致，领导工人制订和争取实现今年生产计划。由于任务明确，分工合理，一、二两月份已获得显著成绩。今年北京市工业局，为适应广大市民需要，要求电车公司从去年每天平均出车六十八辆增至九十七辆。电车公司根据这一要求，规定该公司修造厂全年任务是：新造电车十八辆，彻底大修机车和拖车各十二辆，中修十二辆。若与去年全部工程相比，增加了百分之五十。该厂的党、政、工、团为统一步调，保证完成任务，于一月初召开了党政工团扩大会议，吸收有关的技术人员参加，切实讨论如何制订具体计划，并成立了拟订生产计划与管理计划的两个小组。生产计划组是以全年所规定的新造、大修、中修和日常修理车辆的数目，按各种条件，分全年为六期，每二月一期，初步具体订定每期任务。并根据生产过程及机器效能，技术条件，如首由铆工铆车盘，然后木工作车箱，电工配线，铆工作车皮，大修工制底盘的全部进度表，规定各部完成日期。管理计划组则是为保证完成生产计划而草拟了各种制度，如成本核算、记录统计、工作检查、标准规格、工作报告单、奖励制度、生产定额等。两组草拟计划后，交党政工团联席会修正，再交各部门技术人员及工人群众深入讨论。经多次修改然后订出。
  把计划变成群众自己的
    与此同时，党、政、工、团便分头布置工作。党、团支部号召党团员根据计划草案的精神，及各人的具体条件，制订个人计划，从而保证完成并超过全厂今年生产计划。同时，要党团员深入联系群众，针对群众对订计划的思想顾虑（如怕任务太重完成不了，嫌麻烦，怕多干活分不清谁好谁坏等）进行教育，说明订计划的重要性，以及领导上接受去年“百辆电车修复运动”中两次评模失败的经验教训，建立了成绩记载制度，赏罚分明，且准备实行超额奖励制。党、团支部提出在制定个人计划时，要以生产多、质量好、遵守劳动纪律和努力学习提高技术为主。在讨论订计划时，工人们把过去生产中存在的问题，如原料供应不及时，工具不够等，均通过支部向行政提出，要求研究解决。工会也召开了小组长会议，进行动员布置。
    经过一周的酝酿，已基本上打消了群众的思想顾虑。一月十日，行政召集全体职工大会，宣布生产计划，并对去年评模工作作了深刻检讨。会后，按生产单位组织小组讨论，制订个人计划。因为事先有了准备，又有党、团员为核心起带头作用，所以在十天内，个人计划都顺利地制订了。对个别不切合实际，太多或太少者，小组内都提出了修正意见。个人全年计划中，一般党团员的一、二月份计划，均比去年平均每期生产任务提高了百分之三十以上。
    一般都超过了原来计划百分三十以上
    在订计划后，两月来工作有了显著成绩。一般都超过原计划的百分之三十以上，有的则提高了数倍。如案工十九人做铜头片，过去一个月做三三○片，一月份已增至八三五片。旋工刨油壶，订计划前，一天作一个，一、二月则保持每天两个的纪录。锻工打六分螺丝，过去一天打四十条，明确了任务后，提高到六十五条。架车班二月份出车任务每天九二部，实际完成九六·五部，平均每天增加四·五部。做电缸克碰，过去平均一天一个，党员苏兰波创造了一天两个半的新纪录，刺激了赵文成，现在他又以日产三个的新纪录追上了前者。效率提高的原因，主要是订计划后有了奋斗目标，工友们都为保证与超过计划而努力，提高了自觉性与积极性，研究改进技术，初步掀起劳动竞赛。另外，在劳动组织上，过去分工是笼统的，现在则按各人特长具体确定，使各人发挥了力量；固定工具和机器的使用，也使得他们更熟练其效能，而掌握自如了。同时，又有了工作日报表，成绩好坏显明，刺激了大家的前进心；如效率骤减，也能促使领导上及时研究改进。目前存在的主要问题，是各部门工作衔接得还不好：订计划后，个别部门工友们自发地掀起了生产竞赛，造成各部间的工作发展不平衡，使得个别生产好的单位，发生了停工待料现象。因此，该厂领导上必须有计划地引导全厂走上生产竞赛高潮，并以订定联系合同的办法，来推动与保证各部门工作的齐步前进。
  保证生产计划贯彻的重要因素
    这次，生产计划能以贯彻得较好的一个重要因素，是党、政、工、团的步调一致。在去冬以前，该厂党、政、工、团还是联系不够密切，各有各的中心任务，有时党、工、团的负责人，甚至都不知道本月份的生产任务；没有结合生产，而单搞工人教育与发展组织。党的负责人认为，党内教育工作做好了，工人觉悟提高后，才能提高生产；青年团曾一度专搞青工文娱，甚至要占用生产时间；工会抓不住中心，除对工人泛泛作一般教育外，缺乏计划性，因此工作往往形成被动；行政只是按系统找工程师技术员或领班，生产任务是不通过群众讨论的。这样当然是不能很快地提高生产效能的。
