　　(I) Important Experiences in the Winter School Movement in Shandong Province
	Proceeding from the Actual Thinking of the Masses, Closely Integrating Production and Disaster Relief, Calling on the Masses to be Models of Learning and Production.

	Shandong Province is experiencing widespread disasters, and production and disaster relief is the central task at present. Therefore, in running winter schools, various localities have combined this work to organize learning, and at the same time, through winter schools, have conducted education on production for self-salvation and thrift for famine preparedness.
	I. The learning organization forms are as follows: The more established and regular learning organizations include women's classes (or noon classes), youth classes, adult classes, and out-of-school children's classes (some called night schools). Women's classes are scheduled for noon classes based on the busy and free times of rural women. Youth classes, adult classes, and out-of-school children's classes (all male) mostly study at night. According to recent statistics, a total of 1,438,642 people in the province participate in these organized learning activities. In addition, some people have to engage in sideline production during the winter slack season. For this reason, various localities have also established learning organizations combined with mass production organizations, such as establishing study groups (such as reading groups, literacy groups) in transportation organizations, mills, oil mills, flour mills, and other production organizations; and forming study groups composed of young adults and children who collect grass and firewood. Because these people do not have regular time to participate in regular winter schools, their learning methods are decentralized and flexible. For example, a transportation team in the Jiaodong area wrote the names of the items they were transporting, such as "jars" and "water tanks," and where they were transported from. They found it very practical, and it could be used to associate and help with memory, so they improved their learning enthusiasm and inspired learning requirements. Everyone produced and learned at the same time. Several hundred thousand people are engaged in this type of learning. In total, about two million people in the province participated in winter schools this year.
	II. In terms of learning content: In addition to cultural literacy education, another important educational content of winter schools is current affairs and political affairs and ideological education on central tasks. For example, in some areas of central and southern Shandong, some middle peasants were afraid to push manure into the fields. After explaining the land reform policy in winter schools, the ideological concerns of the masses were broken, and ideological obstacles in production were eliminated. In water-stricken areas, superstitious legends such as "water ghosts" were popular among the masses, so anti-superstition education and the inculcation of scientific ideas were carried out in combination. During the period when people's representative conferences were held in various places, democratic education was generally conducted in combination. In addition, some areas (such as the Taishan area) also invited labor models and people with rich agricultural production experience to explain production knowledge. In areas with severe disasters, more emphasis was placed on education on organization, production for self-salvation. These educations have been very effective. For example, Shigu Hou Village, Juyi County, Yimeng District, changed the thinking of village cadres and the masses that production and disaster relief did not require leadership through winter schools, and established production organizations. Another example is Xiaoyi Village, Laiwu County, Tai'an District. Through literacy classes, everyone made production plans and proposed that they should not only strive to be learning models, but also strive to be models in production and disaster relief. In addition, this year's winter school also solved the contradiction between winter school and village work. The method is to set out a timetable, such as arranging the order of cultural classes, political classes, and production classes, and stipulating a certain amount of time for village cadres to announce matters or arrange temporary work. In this way, work tasks were implemented through winter schools, and it also avoided the conflict between going to winter school and attending meetings.

　　（一）山东省冬学运动重要经验
    从群众思想实际出发，密切结合生产救灾，  号召群众作学习和生产模范。
    通讯员李江源、潘岳、宫明轩
    山东灾荒普遍，生产救灾是当前的中心工作任务。因此，在开办冬学中，各地都结合了这一工作来组织学习，同时通过冬学进行了生产自救、节约备荒的教育。
    一、学习组织形式是这样的：比较定型的正规的学习组织有妇女班（或称午班）、青年班、成年班、失学儿童班（有的称为夜校）。妇女班根据了乡村妇女的忙闲都定为中午上课，青年班、成年班、失学儿童班（全是男的），多数在晚上学习。参加这些组织学习的群众，据最近统计，全省共有一百四十三万八千六百四十二名。除此而外，尚有一些群众要在冬季农闲期间从事副业生产，为此，各地又办有与群众生产组织相结合的学习组织，如在运输组织、磨坊、油坊、粉坊等生产组织中建立学习小组（如读报组、识字组）；由拾草打柴的青壮年和儿童组成学习小组等。这部分群众因为没有正常的时间参加正规的冬学，学习方式是分散而灵活的。如胶东区有个运输组，在刚组织学习的时候，把他们运的东西上边写上名字“罐子”“水缸”等和从什么地方运来的。他们觉得非常实用，且可借以连想帮助记忆，所以提高了学习热情和启发了学习要求，大家一面生产一面学习。进行这种学习的群众也有几十万。总计全省今年参加冬学的约二百万人。
    二、在学习内容方面：除进行文化识字教育外，冬学的另一重要教育内容是时事政治和中心工作的思想教育。如鲁中南有些地区部分中农不敢往地里推粪，在冬学里进行了土地改革政策的讲解后，打破了群众的思想顾虑，扫除了生产中的思想障碍。在水灾地区，群众中流行着“水鬼”等迷信传说，遂结合进行了反迷信，灌输科学思想的教育。在各地召开各界人民代表会议期间，一般都结合进行了民主教育。此外，有些地区（如泰山专区）还请劳动模范及富有农业生产经验的人讲解生产知识。在灾荒严重地区更着重进行了组织起来、生产自救的教育。这些教育收效很大，如沂蒙区莒沂县石崮后村，通过冬学转变了村干部和群众认为生产救灾不用领导的思想，建立了生产组织。又如太山区莱芜县孝义村，通过识字班，各人都订了生产计划，并提出：不但要争取学习模范，在生产救灾中也要争取模范。此外，今年冬学中还解决了冬学与村中工作的矛盾，其办法是订出课程表，如排定文化课、政治课、生产课的次序外，并规定了一定时间给村干部宣布事情或布置临时工作。这样，通过冬学贯彻了工作任务，还免得上冬学和开会抵触。
