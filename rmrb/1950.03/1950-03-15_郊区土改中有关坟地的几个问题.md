To the Editor:

Land reform is currently underway in the suburbs of Beijing. I have several questions and would appreciate it if you could provide answers.

I. During land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, will the gravesites of former landlords be confiscated and nationalized? If they remain the property of the original owners, will they be allowed to bury deceased people there after land reform?

II. If burial is permitted, will burial certificates be issued?

III. Does the term "gravesite" refer only to the "grave" itself, or does it include the grave and the surrounding land?

IV. In the "Instructions on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Old Liberated Areas" passed by the Government Administration Council, does "gravesites and trees on gravesites should be protected and remain untouched" mean that the state protects them after the land is nationalized, or that the original owners protect them?

V. If a gravesite is large, planted with hundreds of trees, and has a gate tower and archway, will it be allowed to maintain its original appearance? What if there are no trees?

Mr. Bai Ronghan:

The answers to your questions are as follows:

I. During land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, the gravesites of landlords will not be confiscated and will remain the property of the original owners. They may continue to bury deceased people there.

II. Since the gravesites of landlords are not confiscated, the original land deeds for the gravesites remain with the original owners. Therefore, there is no need to issue "burial certificates." If a large area of cultivated land surrounds the gravesite and has been allocated to farmers, but the gravesite and the surrounding cultivated land are under the same land deed, then after determining the boundaries of the gravesite during land reform, the original owner can exchange it for a land license from the government to confirm land rights and continue to enjoy the gravesite.

III. "Gravesite" generally refers to the land within the burial ground where the grave is located. The large area of cultivated land surrounding it will be handled in accordance with Article 1 of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Old Liberated Areas."

IV. "Gravesites and trees on gravesites should be protected and remain untouched" means that gravesites and trees on gravesites will not be confiscated during land reform. The original owner is responsible for the daily care of the gravesite and the trees on it, but the state should provide legal protection.

V. The trees, gate towers, and archways on the gravesites occupied by landlords can be maintained in their original condition and kept by the original owners. However, the conditions that constitute a gravesite and whether a gravesite is touched or not are not determined by the presence or absence of trees. As long as it is a gravesite, it will be handled in accordance with Article 1 of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Old Liberated Areas."

### 郊区土改中有关坟地的几个问题

专栏：答复与询问

　　郊区土改中有关坟地的几个问题编辑同志：
    京郊现正进行土地改革，兹有问题数则，请给解答是荷。
    一、在京郊土改中，原有地主的坟地，是否没收归国有？如仍为原主所有，土改后是否准许再埋死人？
    二、如准许埋葬死人，是否发给埋葬证件？
    三、所谓“坟地”，是仅指“坟”而言，抑包括坟及四周之土地？
    四、政务院政务会议通过《关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示》一文中，所谓“坟地及坟地上之树木一律保护不动”，是指土地收归国有后由国家保护，抑由原主保护？
    五、如坟地较大，种有几百棵树木，有门楼牌坊，是否准许保持原状？如没有树木呢？
      白荣翰白荣翰先生：
    所询问题答复如下：
    一、京郊土改中，对地主之坟地一律不没收，仍归原主所有，可以继续埋葬死人。
    二、地主的坟地既不没收，坟地红契仍归原主所有，自然不需要再发给“埋葬证件”。如坟地四周有大块耕地已分配给农民使用，而坟地与四周耕地是同一张红契，则在土改中确定坟地界限后，可向政府换领土地执照，确定地权，继续享有该坟地。
    三、“坟地”一般地是指坟茔所在的坟圈内之土地而言。其四周与之相连的大块耕地，则仍按政务院“关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示”第一条处理。
    四、“坟地及坟地上之树木一律保护不动”，是指在土地改革中不没收坟地和坟地上树木。因为坟地及其上面的树木平日看护之责，当由原主负责，但国家在法律上应予保护。
    五、地主占有的坟地上面的树木、门楼和牌坊，可维持原状由原主保管。但构成坟地的条件和坟地动与不动，并不是以有无树木来决定，只要是坟地，即一律按政务院《关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示》第一条处理。
