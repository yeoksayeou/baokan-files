    Linqing Supply and Marketing Cooperative Organizes Sales Teams
    to Promote Industrial Products in Rural Areas
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Linqing Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province, in order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, has organized fifty "Industrial Products to the Countryside Teams." They have already sold a large number of daily necessities such as bamboo products, iron products, matches, socks, towels, and soap, and exchanged them for products such as cotton and grain. This method can not only promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, but also solve the livelihood of some urban residents; it is convenient for rural farmers to purchase goods, and urban industrial and handicraft products have also found a market. At present, all industries have also temporarily organized teams to go to the countryside to directly sell goods. The town's supply and marketing cooperative has gained the following experiences from the sales: (1) The sales products should be equipped with goods according to the different seasonal needs of farmers. (2) There must be a dedicated person to lead, and the town cooperative and the teams must establish a business relationship. The sales routes of each team must also be divided to avoid confusion. (3) Formulate sales covenants to regulate profits. Inspections must be carried out at any time to prevent the teams from deceiving farmers and to establish credibility among farmers.

    临清供销社组织推销小组
    下乡推销工业品
    【本报讯】河北临清镇供销社为开展城乡物资交流，组织了五十个“工业品下乡小组”。已推销竹制品、铁制品、火柴、袜子、毛巾、肥皂等日用品为数甚多，并换回棉花、粮食等产品。此项办法不仅能促进城乡物资交流，并能解决一部分市民生活；乡村农民购物既方便，城市工业、手工业产品同时亦找到了销路。现各行业亦均临时组织小组下乡直接推销货物。该镇供销社从推销中得到如下几点经验：（一）推销品要按照农民不同季节需要去配备货物。（二）需有专人领导，镇社与小组要订立业务关系。各组推销路线亦须划分，以免混乱。（三）制定推销公约，规定利润。并须随时检查，不使小组欺蒙农民，在农民中建立信用。
