　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th. TASS, Moscow, March 9th: The Soviet Peace Committee has issued a statement protesting the anti-democratic actions of the US and Dutch governments in banning the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace from entering their countries. The statement said: The refusal of the US and Dutch governments to allow the representatives of the Standing Committee to enter their countries shows that the two governments are unwilling to consider the will of the people who advocate consolidating peace and resolutely oppose the criminal activities of instigators of a new war. We firmly believe that the actions of the US and Dutch governments do not reflect the opinions of millions of American and Dutch citizens, who, together with all the nations of the world, are happy to prevent war and support suggestions aimed at this goal. Signed by the Presidium of the Soviet Peace Committee: Tikhonov, Academician Vavilov, Fadeyev, Academician Grekov, Mikhailov, Korneychuk, Popov, Surkov, Simonov, Gerasimov, Yershova.

    苏和平委员会提抗议
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联拥护和平委员会顷发表声明，抗议美国与荷兰政府禁止世界拥护和平大会常设委员会代表团入境的反民主行动，声明称：美国与荷兰政府拒绝常设委员会代表入境一事，表明两国政府不愿考虑主张巩固和平与坚决反对新战争挑拨者犯罪活动的人民意志。我们深信：美国与荷兰两国政府的行动，并不能反映千百万美国与荷兰公民的意见，他们是与全世界一切民族一起乐于阻止战争并拥护针对这一目的之建议的。苏联拥护和平委员会主席团签署：吉洪诺夫、科学院院士瓦维洛夫、法捷耶夫、科学院院士格列科夫、米哈伊洛夫、考涅楚克、波波夫、苏尔科夫、西蒙诺夫、格拉希莫夫、叶尔硕娃。
