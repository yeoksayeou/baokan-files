Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th—Following the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet alliance, the failure of atomic bomb blackmail, and the growing strength of worldwide peace and democratic forces, U.S. imperialist elements have recently staged a farcical double act regarding calls for U.S.-Soviet talks. Senator Smith, a Republican, first disseminated this idea, suggesting on the 16th that "Stalin and Truman meet" (Agence France-Presse). Subsequently, Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also suggested on the 17th that "Acheson represent the United States in negotiations with the British and Soviet foreign ministers" (Associated Press). Former Republican presidential candidate Stassen also advocated on the 18th that "the leaders of the United States, Britain, and France and the leaders of the Soviet Union hold a large-scale meeting" (Agence France-Presse). Truman, however, denied the necessity of U.S.-Soviet talks. In his speech on the 22nd, he once again insisted on the U.S.-British-proposed plan in the United Nations, which was rejected by the Soviet Union, to monopolize atomic energy production, refusing to reach any agreement with the Soviet Union, and declared at a press conference on the 23rd that "a new approach to the Soviet Union at this moment may be dangerous" (U.S. Information Service). Truman's words prove that U.S. imperialism has no sincerity whatsoever in seeking peace.
    The proposal of negotiations with the Soviet Union is another manifestation of the superficial strength and inner weakness of U.S. imperialism. Truman warned in his speech on the 23rd, "Do not be discouraged by difficulties and obstacles." The creation of an atmosphere for negotiations with the Soviet Union by a section of the U.S. ruling group is certainly not intended to conduct any peaceful negotiations with the Soviet Union, but to ease the dissatisfaction of the American people and world public opinion, so as to prepare political capital for further pursuing a policy of war. Smith put forward this suggestion because "everything has failed," so "direct talks are necessary." Connally believes: "If this meeting fails again, the United States should clearly state that we can build bombs as big and as good as possible, and then build bombs as big and as good as possible." Stassen's remarks were even more explicit, saying: "Even if the invitation to the meeting is rejected, the moral (referring to anti-Soviet and anti-communist) leadership position that the United States bears in the world will still be strengthened because the United States has called for this meeting." These remarks reflect the true intentions of U.S. imperialist elements.

　　原子弹讹诈可耻失败后美帝散布对苏谈判空气
    【新华社北京二十八日电】在中苏缔结盟约、原子弹讹诈失败、以及全世界和平民主力量日益壮大的情况下，美帝国主义分子最近又演出了一幕关于要求举行美苏会谈的滑稽双簧。首先散播这个空气的是美共和党参议员史密斯，他在十六日建议“斯大林与杜鲁门会晤”（法新社）。接着，美参院外交委员会主席康纳利也于十七日建议“由艾奇逊代表美国与英苏外长谈判”（美联社）。前共和党总统竞选人史塔生也于十八日主张“美、英、法三国的领袖们和苏联的领袖们，举行一个大规模的会议”（法新社）。而杜鲁门则否认美苏会谈的必要。他不仅于廿二日的演讲中，再度坚持在联合国中为美英所提出而为苏联所否决的企图垄断原子能生产的计划，不愿与苏联取得任何协议，并于二十三日的记者招待会上声明“此刻与苏联作新的接近可能是危险的”（美新处）。杜鲁门的话证明美帝国主义没有寻求和平的丝毫诚意。
    对苏谈判问题的提出，是美帝国主义外强中干的又一表现。杜鲁门在二十三日的谈话中就曾警告“不要因为遇到困难与阻碍而沮丧”。美国统治集团的一部分人制造对苏谈判的空气，当然不是真要对苏联进行什么和平谈判，而是要缓和一下美国人民和世界和平舆论的不满，以便为进一步地推行战争政策准备政治资本。史密斯提出这一建议的理由，是因为“一切都失败了”，所以举行“直接会谈是必要的”。康纳利则认为：“倘此一会议又告失败，美国应明白表示我们能造多大多好的炸弹，便制造多大多好的炸弹。”史塔生的谈话更露骨，他说：“即使参加会议的邀请被人拒绝，美国在世界上所担负的道义的（按指反苏反共的）领导地位，仍将因美国的曾经号召这一会议而告加强。”这些谈话反映了美帝国主义分子的真正的意图。
