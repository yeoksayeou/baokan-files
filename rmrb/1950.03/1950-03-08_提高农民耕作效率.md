　　Improving Farmers' Farming Efficiency
    Chen Hengli
    The improvement of farming efficiency I am discussing here only refers to the existing technical level of farmers, and does not involve the promotion of modern science and technology. The method to improve is to universalize the highest level of farming technology among the current farmers. We conducted a sample survey on the status of agricultural labor in Songjiang Province. Based on materials from one village each in Shuangcheng, Lalin, Acheng, Hulan, and Wuchang, the proportion of labor is roughly as follows:

    Labor Category                                    Percentage of Total Labor Force
     Top-tier                                          25%
    Average                                          60%
    Low-tier                                          15%
    Total                                          100%

    In 1948 (Songjiang Province experienced a slightly lower-than-average yield that year), the difference in unit (da shai - large area) production volume for these types of labor, under the same cultivated land area and production conditions, was:

    Labor Category    Average Unit Yield      Converted to Kilograms      Difference
    Top-tier        6 shi of coarse grain      1,200                     -
    Average        4.5 shi of coarse grain      900                       300 kg less than Top-tier
    Low-tier        2.5 shi of coarse grain      500                       700 kg less than Top-tier
                                                                        400 kg less than Average

    (Above excerpted from survey materials of the Songjiang veteran farmers' symposium)

    There is also a particularly good type among the top-tier labor force, but there are no materials to illustrate what proportion they account for. Examples of unit production volume for particularly good labor in 1948:

     Name              Average Unit Yield    Converted to Kilograms        Note
     Huang Yongde, Shuangcheng        9.3 shi        1,860
     Zhang Jinghe, Hulan        7.2 shi        1,440
    Average                              1,650        450 kg more than Top-tier
    (Excerpted from survey materials of the First Songjiang Labor Model Congress)

    In 1948, the unit production volume of particularly good labor in Songjiang exceeded the level of 1924 (the year with the highest agricultural unit yield in Northeast China). According to the "Statistical Data on Crop Harvest Volume" of the puppet "Xingnong Department," the unit yield of cultivated land in Northeast China decreased year by year, with the average of North and South Manchuria being 1,778 kilograms per hectare in 1924 (highest), which dropped to 1,030 kilograms in 1944 (lowest). Comparing Huang Yongde of Shuangcheng with 1924, it has exceeded by 82 kilograms.

    From this, it can be seen that if the highest technical level among the current farmers is universalized, then the agricultural output of Songjiang also has the hope of reaching the level of 1924. However, the difference in unit yield among the particularly good, top-tier, average, and low-tier labor in the farmer labor force is very large. The details of each type of labor are described as follows:

    Particularly good labor, after a lifetime of farming experience (generally between 40 and 50 years old), has developed a particularly astonishing resilience in the long-term struggle with nature, and is always full of labor enthusiasm. They have experienced the general laws of crop growth and natural seasons, and have thoroughly understood the various details of farming. Therefore, the depth of cultivation is appropriate, and the degree of adaptation of farm tools, fertilization, livestock power, human power, and weather (drought, flood, changes in normal years) is relatively accurate in the old-fashioned technology. And in management (utilizing capital and controlling manpower, etc.), they also have a set of methods. However, most of them can only "understand in their hearts," and can do it when the time comes, but cannot summarize their farming experience and take a step towards the field of scientific management.

    Top-tier labor is inferior to particularly good labor in both technical and management aspects. However, they study hard and have also found some laws in farming, relying entirely on a high degree of labor enthusiasm to make up for the lack of technical and management experience. The adaptation of farming techniques to natural conditions lacks accuracy, and in farming terms, "they can't put all their energy into the key points."

    The enthusiasm of average labor is not low, but they do not know how to manage, are not skilled in old-fashioned farming techniques, some are young, and some are careless. They work hard in the fields all year round, but the effect is not great. Without someone to guide them in the field, they do not have the opportunity to learn and improve.

    The situation of low-tier labor is the opposite of the above. They are often "the smartest in the crowd," cunning, and good at playing tricks. They are willing to put their energy into other things, and the results of agricultural labor are particularly low. Some rely on other industries as a source of livelihood (fishing, being petty vendors, looking for opportunities to make petty gains...); some are purely lazy (rather not eat than put in effort), and some are loafers.

    Now that we understand the proportion of agricultural labor and its existing forms, we should quickly universalize the highest level of farming among the current farmers. The steps to universally improve farming efficiency: within one or two years, require each type of labor to improve their technical level by one step—top-tier improving to the best, average improving to top-tier, and low-tier improving to average. Gradually achieve universal alignment with the best. Then, based on the progress, promote and apply new farming methods.

    How can farming efficiency be universally improved by one step? In addition to strengthening the leadership role of the Party and the government in rural production and strengthening labor mutual aid organizations, these two basic links, we also need to:

    First, agricultural leadership departments (especially at the provincial and county levels) must summarize the best farming experiences and methods of farmers as the basis for promoting and improving the technology of ordinary farmers. This requires the constant close contact and combination of agricultural scientists, technicians, agricultural leaders, and direct agricultural producers. Today's agricultural leadership is not only limited to making general calls, plans, arranging spring plowing in the spring, arranging autumn harvest in the fall, and calculating the production figures at the end of the year to complete the task. More importantly, we must thoroughly understand the agricultural situation, thoroughly understand the various details of farming, and learn from the masses ourselves in a timely manner to enrich ourselves, and in turn, guide farmers' production. We need to learn from the masses of farmers from the beginning. Good farmers, in the long-term struggle with nature, some have a complete set of "local methods" and "local technologies," and some have unique practical achievements and technical knowledge in a certain aspect. However, they will not regularize, will not improve, or are scattered and unsystematic. If we earnestly study, summarize, and promote them, they will immediately become a fighting force. We summarize the farming experience and methods of the masses into relatively systematic knowledge. On the one hand, it is to improve the technical level of ordinary farmers. On the other hand, the unscientific components of farmers' farming technology (such as thinking that autumn plowing is bad, sticking to conventions, etc.) can also be criticized, and the existing highest technical level can be further improved. In short, to promote modern science and technology, it must start with the universal technical level of the current mass of farmers.

    Second, use farmers' methods to educate farmers, organize farmers to guide farmers, so that ordinary farmers can achieve practical improvements in farming efficiency. After we summarize the good farming experiences and methods into knowledge, we must also carry out education and guidance work among ordinary farmers. Because the improvement of farming technology requires a process of familiarity and training by ordinary farmers, it cannot be effective with general calls. Veteran farmers tell us practical and feasible methods: one is the lectures on agricultural knowledge. Use the winter slack season (or winter school), taking villages or settlements as units, hold fixed or unfixed forums to allow farmers to exchange management and farming experience with each other. Particularly good farmers have already been summarized by districts and counties for their methods, and educated to have more systematic knowledge. At this time, they can take on the role of rural lecturers. It is easy to understand and accept when farmers educate farmers. One is the on-site guidance of farming. During busy farming seasons, organize some veteran farmers to guide the farming of ordinary farmers separately. Ordinary labor inherently has labor enthusiasm, but does not have the technical essentials. Once pointed out, they will inevitably quickly understand and improve their farming efficiency. This is the most practical and effective method. Huang Yongde of Shuangcheng taught all the group members who could not produce in 1948 and 1949 how to farm, which was the result of casual chats on the one hand and on-site guidance on the other. This requires arduous organization and leadership work. Without this, ordinary farmers cannot achieve practical improvement in farming technology, and the energy of thousands of people is wasted invisibly (the production effect is not great, but the effort is the same). Without this, the application of fertilizer, tools, and all economic forces to farming cannot exert the due effect. Without this, ordinary farmers do not have the habit of learning and cannot lay the foundation for accepting modern science and technology.

    If the existing technical level of farmers is improved by one step, taking Shuangcheng as an example, the county's cultivated land area is 200,000 hectares. Using the production volume of 1948 as a calculation standard, if the level of the existing labor force is improved by one step, then the annual increase in production will reach 70,500 tons, as detailed in the following table:

   Labor Category  Improvement Level  Total Area (Hectares)  Average Increase Required      Total Increase in Production
                                          (Kilograms)
   Top-tier      Particularly Good  50,000            450          22,500
     Average      Top-tier    120,000          300          36,000
     Low-tier      Average    30,000            400          12,000
       Total                                              70,500

    Assuming that the technical level of ordinary farmers is improved to the level of Huang Yongde, the amount of increase in production is obviously even greater.

　　提高农民耕作效率
    陈恒力
    我这里所说的提高耕作效率，只就农民现有的技术水平来说，不涉及现代科学技术的推广问题。提高的方法，是把现有农民中最高的耕作技术水平加以普遍化。我们曾抽查松江省的农业劳动力的现状，根据双城、拉林、阿城、呼兰、五常各一个村的材料，劳动力的比例大致是这样：
    劳动力别                                    占全劳动力比例
     上等                                          二五％
    普通                                          六○％
    下等                                          一五％
    合计                                          一○○％
    一九四八年度（松江省是比常年产量微低的年度），这几种劳动力在耕种同等面积土地、同等生产条件的情况下，单位（大垧）生产量的差别：
    劳动力别    单位平均产量      折合公斤      比差
    上等        粗粮六石          一、二○○
    普通        粗粮四石五斗      九○○        比上等减三○○公斤
    下等        粗粮二石五斗      五○○        比上等减七○○公斤
                                                比普通减四○○公斤
    （以上摘引松江老农座谈会调查材料）
    上等劳动力中又有一种特别好的，但占多大比重，还没有材料说明。而特别好劳动力一九四八年的单位生产量举例：
     姓名              单位平均产量    折合公斤        附注
     双城黄永德        九石三斗        一、八六○
     呼兰张景和        七石二斗        一、四四○
    平均                              一、六五○    比上等增四五○公斤
    （摘引松江第一届劳模大会调查材料）
    一九四八年度，松江特别好劳动力的单位生产量，有的已经超过一九二四年（东北农业单位产量最高的年代）的水平。据伪《兴农部农作物收获量统计资料》记载：东北耕地的单位产量逐年递减，一九二四南北满总平均一垧产量一、七七八公斤（最高），一九四四就降为一、○三○公斤（最低）。如以双城黄永德与一九二四比较，已超过八二公斤。
    由此可见，把现有农民中最高的技术水平加以普遍化，则松江的农产量也有希望达到一九二四的水平。但农民劳动力中特别好的、上等的、普通的、下等的单位产量的相差很悬殊。关于各种劳动力的详情，分述如下：
    特别劳动力，是经过大半辈子的农作锻炼（一般是在四十至五十岁之间），在长期与自然斗争的过程中养成一种特别惊人的忍耐力，劳动热情永远饱满。他们体验到了庄稼成长与自然季节的一般规律，把庄稼活中的各种细节都吃透了，因而耕作深浅适宜，在旧式技术中使农具、施肥、畜力、人力及天时（旱、涝、平年的变化）的适应程度相当准确。而经营上（运用资本与支配人力等）亦有一套办法。但是他们大多只能“心里懂得”，到时会做，而不能把农事经验总结起来，向科学经营的领域迈进一步。
    上等劳动力，无论在技术方面与经营方面都比特别好的差一些。然而他们用心钻研，也摸到了一些农事上的规律，全仗高度的劳动热情以弥补技术及经营经验之不足。在农作技术与自然条件的适应上还缺欠准确性，用庄稼话来说是“不能把劲头都用到节骨眼上”。
    普通劳动力的热情并不低，只是不会经营，不熟练旧式耕作技术，有的人是年轻，有的人是粗心大意。终年在地里死卖气力干活，而效果就是不大。没有人实地指点，他们得不到学习与提高的机会。
    下等劳动力的情况与上相反。他们往往是“人中的尖子”，有心眼，会耍乖。他们肯把精力用在旁的上面，农业劳动成果特别低下。有的仰仗其他行业做生活来源（打鱼、做小贩，看空子投机取巧………）；有的是纯粹懒蛋（宁可不吃也不下力），有的是二流子。
    我们了解了农业劳动力的比例及其现存形态，应当赶快地把现有农民中最高的耕作水平加以普遍化。普遍的提高耕作效率的步骤：一、二年内要求各种劳动力各把技术水平提高一步——上等提高到最好的，普通提高到上等的，下等提高到普通的。逐渐做到普遍向最好的看齐。然后根据进展情况推广与应用新式耕作法。
    耕作效率怎样普遍的提高一步呢？除了加强党与政府在农村生产的领导作用，加强劳动互助组织这两个基本环节外，还要：
    第一、农业领导部门（尤其是省与县），要把农民中最好的耕作经验和方法进行总结，做为推广与提高一般农民技术的张本。这需要农业科学家、技术工作者、农业领导同志与农业直接生产者的经常密切联系与结合。今天的农业领导，不仅限于做了一般号召，计划，春天布置春耕，秋天布置秋收，到年底统计个生产数目字，就算完成任务。更重要的我们要彻底懂得农情，彻底懂得农耕中的各种细节，自己并及时向群众学习充实，反过来再去指导农民生产。我们需要从头向农民群众学习。好的农民在长期与自然斗争中，有的具备了成套的“土办法”与“土技术”，有的在某一方面有独到的实际造诣与技术知识。但他们不会规律化，不会提高，或者是零散而没有系统的。如我们切实研究，加以总结，再推广下去，马上会成为战斗的力量。我们总结群众耕作经验和方法成为比较有系统的知识，一方面是提高一般农民技术水平，另方面，农民耕作技术上的非科学成分（比如认为秋翻地不好，墨守成规等），也可以得到批判，把现有的最高技术水平再提高一步。总之，要推广现代科学技术，必先由普遍现有农民群众的技术水平开始。
    第二、用农民的方法教育农民，组织农民指导农民，使一般农民在耕作效率上得到实际的提高。我们把好的耕作经验和方法总结为知识之后，还要在一般农民中进行教育与指导工作。因为耕作技术的提高，需要经过一般农民的熟悉与训练的过程，不是一般号召所能奏效的。老农告诉我们可行的实际办法：一是农业常识的讲习。利用冬闲（或冬学），以村或屯为单位，定型的或不定型的召开座谈会，使农民互相交换经营与耕作经验。特别好的农民已先由区县总结他们的方法，并教育之使有比较系统化的知识。这时可分担农村讲师。以农民教育农民，容易懂也容易接受。一是农耕实地的指导。农忙时，组织一部分老农分头指导一般农民的耕作。普通劳动力本有劳动热情，就是不得技术要领，一经指点，必然很快地领会，而提高了耕作效率。这是最实际有效的办法。双城黄永德，一九四八、四九两年中把不会生产的组员都教会了耕作，就是一方面平时漫谈，一方面实地指导的结果。这需要一个艰苦的组织与领导工作。不如此，一般农民在耕作技术上不能得到实际的提高，千万人的精力无形中在浪费着（生产效果不大，而一样在费劲）。不如此，施肥、工具、一切经济力量投入农作不能发挥应有的效力。不如此，一般农民没有学习习惯，不能打下接受现代科学技术的基础。
    如果把农民的现有技术水平提高一步，以双城为例，全县耕地面积二十万垧，以一九四八年度的生产量做计算标准，把现有劳动力的水平各提高一步，则一个年增产就达七万○五百吨，详见下表：
   劳动力别  提高别  共占面积（垧）  单位平均要      共可增产
                                          求增产（公斤）
   上等      特别好  五万            四五○          二二、五○○
     普通      上等    一二万          三○○          三六、○○○
     下等      普通    三万            四○○          一二、○○○
       合计                                              七○、五○○
    假定一般农民的技术水平都提高到黄永德的程度，增产的数目显然是更加大了。
