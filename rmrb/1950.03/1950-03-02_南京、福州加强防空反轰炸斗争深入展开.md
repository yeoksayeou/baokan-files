Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th: Nanjing, Fuzhou, and other places continue to deepen the anti-bombing struggle. All factory workers in Nanjing unanimously regard strengthening air defense work as the central task recently. All employees of the Nanjing Oil Pressing Plant and Hefeng Flour Mill, in addition to actively carrying out air defense work within the plant, also cooperate with the local garrison troops to form a joint security committee to assist in maintaining local public order. All stations under the Ninghu Railway, including locomotive, engineering, factory, and warehouse units, have successively established security committees. Nanjing Main Station and Zhenjiang Station have added all necessary air defense equipment and strictly implement duty, handover, guarding, and patrol systems. Small stations along the railway have added joint military-police-employee patrol teams to patrol day and night to ensure the safety of the people's railway property and passengers.

In order to actively strengthen air defense work, Fuzhou City established the City Air Defense and Public Security Committee on the 23rd of this month. The committee has established air defense guidance, publicity, rescue, disciplinary, public security, fire protection, and shelter departments, and has determined that the current focus of the city is on air defense propaganda and mobilization work and public security work. Propaganda teams from schools throughout the city have been dispatched to the streets for days to carry out anti-bombing propaganda. All organs, factories, and street residents have begun to set up fire extinguishers, sandbags, and water tanks, and other air defense equipment. The original fire brigades in the city are also actively preparing fire-fighting equipment, and all public and private hospitals have formed various rescue organizations and are stepping up the purchase of large quantities of rescue medicines.
