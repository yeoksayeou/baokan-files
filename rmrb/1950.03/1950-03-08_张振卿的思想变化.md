　　Zhang Zhenqing's Ideological Change
　　Propaganda Department of Baoding Prefectural Committee  Zhou Guoquan

　　Zhang Zhenqing is from Xigou Village, Mancheng, Hebei Province. In the past, his family was very poor and often suffered from the oppression and exploitation of landlords. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, with the help of the democratic government, his life became better. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, his younger brother gloriously sacrificed his life in the army, but he did not get discouraged because of this. On the contrary, he worked more actively. In 1944, he gloriously joined the Communist Party. Later, he actively led the village's guerrilla squad to fight the Japanese devils. After Japan surrendered, he bravely fought against the Kuomintang bandit troops and became an expert in explosives. In the years of struggle, he always worked with full enthusiasm. However, he often thought in his heart: being a cadre is really good. The villagers support you when you fight the enemy; when there is a situation, the whole village sends you information, and you even have weapons to fight the enemy when they come...
　　In the winter of 1948, Baoding was liberated, and Zhang Zhenqing felt that it was time to relax. However, things were not what he thought. The superiors still urged production and supporting the front, supporting the front and production. There was work every day. He became a little impatient and often complained: "The superiors are just creating trouble. Production is not like fighting a war, and it doesn't need leadership! If there is leadership, will there ever be an end! Spring, summer, autumn and winter pass by, and then it's spring, summer, autumn and winter again. Plowing, planting, hoeing and harvesting pass by, and then it's plowing, planting, hoeing and harvesting again. Isn't this becoming a 'headless fly'? This work is so useless!" Sometimes he thought to himself: How nice it would be if I weren't a cadre. My family of three has seventeen mu of land, and what we harvest is enough to eat and wear. I am a family member of a revolutionary martyr, so I don't have to cultivate land for others. Besides working, I also have time to rest. But he also thought: a good life is thanks to the leadership of the Party. If I don't work, I will be letting the Party down. But then he thought: working makes it difficult to avoid making mistakes and offending people; rather than being criticized and losing face in the village in the future, it is better not to be a cadre now and let the district punish me. After thinking about it, he finally decided not to be a cadre.
　　But how could he not be a cadre? He thought that if he was careless in his work, he would probably be replaced. So Zhang Zhenqing didn't take the lead in any work. He would only move when someone pushed him; later, even pushing wouldn't move him. After a while, he still didn't hear any news of him being replaced. Only the superiors urged him even more frequently. He also thought that only by deliberately making some mistakes could the superiors replace him. However, he also considered that small mistakes might not lead to a replacement; if the mistake was too big, it would be embarrassing if he was detained by the district. When the children grow up, it wouldn't be honorable for them to mention that their father had been detained!... He thought about it and couldn't think of a good solution.
　　In the end, he still came up with a plan: to probe the "bottom line" again, to see what measures the district would take against him if he really didn't want to be a cadre. But who could he ask? If he asked the district cadres, he was afraid that they would expose his intentions with further questioning. If he asked the party members in the village, he was also the organization committee member of the branch, and if the party members knew, the work would probably be more difficult to promote. He waited for people working outside to come back and ask, but none of them were coming back now. He waited and waited, but he couldn't find a good opportunity to probe the "bottom line."
　　One day, he suddenly received a notice asking him to participate in a party member training class in the county. He felt a chill in his heart, thinking that he was going to be criticized and punished. Should he go or not? Later, he thought he should still go! He could also probe the "bottom line" there.

　　　　A Battle of Ideology
　　On the way to the county, he thought of many ways to probe the "bottom line": listen to the lectures, observe the attitude of the superiors, and ask the cadres of neighboring villages if they were unwilling to work. ...
　　When the training class started, he didn't pay attention when the county party secretary and other responsible comrades spoke. He thought it was the same old stuff anyway! But when he talked about how society would inevitably develop into a communist society, and how good that society would be, his mind was moved. He thought: Oh, so there is such a society, which is much better than my current situation! But then he thought: Will there really be such a day?
　　After listening to the lectures for five or six days, he learned that if the masses were led well in production, labor mutual aid was organized well, and cooperatives were organized well, agricultural production could be improved day by day. Urban industrial production was also improving day by day. In this way, communist society could come! But even though this society is good, it can't come all at once! Should he be a cadre or not? He couldn't let go of this question in his mind. He couldn't play games in the afternoon, couldn't sleep at night, and couldn't listen in class during the day. He always wanted to think quietly for a while, and he hated it when someone spoke loudly. He kept thinking: although there are no enemies directly burning and killing now, the revolution has not yet succeeded; although my life has improved, it is still far from a better society! If production doesn't need leadership, who would be willing to allocate labor? If there is no superior plan and the masses are allowed to plant crops casually, who would know that planting cotton has such a big relationship with the development of industry... He was afraid of making mistakes and being criticized. If you sincerely want to do good things for the masses, even if there are some mistakes, the superiors and the masses will criticize them, which is for your own good and for the sake of work! Thinking of this, he felt energetic. But he still couldn't make up his mind to work hard right away. Because he also thought that he was already thirty-six years old, and he might not be able to catch up with communist society; moreover, distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. If he takes on work, he will have to delay his work and delay production, and his own life will be affected; it is better not to take on work. He can rest when he is free. But after a while, he recalled: my past ideas were often wrong. For example, when fighting Chiang Kai-shek, at first I thought that he could not be defeated quickly, but the Party's leading comrades said that he could be overthrown soon. The result was like that. As long as we work hard for communist society, coupled with the help of the Soviet Union, it won't be too far away. He still felt that he should work hard.

　　　　Finding the Root of the Problem
　　Just as revolutionary interests, personal interests, long-term interests and immediate interests, peasant thoughts, communist thoughts... were fiercely fighting in his mind, he heard in the lecture: "Every party member must firmly establish a revolutionary outlook on life and oppose the half-hearted revolution." These words were like a steel needle piercing his sore spot. He felt a cold shiver involuntarily. He finally understood: "So I am a half-hearted revolutionary. My unwillingness to take on work is because my revolutionary outlook on life is not firm enough. This thought is a big mistake for a communist. I can't keep making mistakes in the future." So Zhang Zhenqing made up his mind to work hard. During the training, he made a small plan to combine work and production.
　　After returning to the village from the training, he not only actively did his own work well, but also explained his learning experience to other party members. He said that he must study hard in the future. People in the village were also wondering: Zhang Zhenqing received training, and I don't know what good magic weapon he got. He has been so energetic since he came back!

### 张振卿的思想变化

　　张振卿的思想变化
    保定地委宣传部  周国全
    张振卿是河北省满城西苟村人。他过去家里很穷，常受地主的欺压剥削，抗战后，在民主政府帮助下，日子才过得好一点。抗战中，他弟弟参军光荣牺牲了，但他没有为此泄气，反而工作更积极。一九四四年他光荣地参加了共产党。以后又积极领导村里的游击小队打鬼子。日本投降后，他又勇敢地和国民党匪军战斗，成为爆炸能手。在几年的斗争里，他总是一股劲的干。他心里却常盘算着：当干部真不错，打了敌人老乡们都拥护；有了情况全村人都给我送信，敌人来了自己还有武器打他……。
    一九四八年冬天保定解放了，张振卿觉着可该松口气了。但是，事情和他想的不一样，上级还是督促着生产、支前，支前、生产，一天价有工作。他就有点不耐烦了，常常发牢骚说：“上级就是没事找事，这生产可不比打仗，还用领导！要是领导这还有个完！春夏秋冬过去又是春夏秋冬，耕耩锄收过去又是耕耩锄收，这不成了‘没头翁’吗。这工作干的太没用！”有时他自己打算着：我要是不当干部多好，我三口人十七亩地，打下的够吃够穿。我是烈属，又不用给别人代耕，除了做活还有歇着的工夫。但是他也想到：生活好是党领导的，要不工作可是对不起党。可是他一转念：作工作就难保不犯错误和得罪人；与其将来在村里受批评丢人，还不如现在不当干部，让区里处分好些。他想来想去，终于决定了不当干部。
    但是，怎样才能不当干部呢？他想着大概工作马虎点就会被撤换的。于是张振卿什么工作也不带头干了，除非有人推推才动动；后来连推也推不动了。这样过了一阵，他还是听不见有撤换他的风声，只是上级对他的督促更勤了。他又想着只有故意犯点错误，才能叫上级换掉。不过，他又考虑到犯小错误不一定能换；要是错误大了，万一被区上押起来那多难看。将来孩子长大了，提起他爹挨过押也不光荣！……他左思右想，怎么也想不出个好办法来。
    最后，他还是想出了个办法：再摸摸“底”，看真是硬不当干部，区里会用什么办法对付他？可是问谁呢？问区干部吧，怕他们一追问，露出他的马脚。问村里党员吧，他又在支部担任了组织委员，党员要知道了，恐怕工作更难推动了。等着在外面工作的人回来了问吧，现在他们谁也不回来。等来等去，他总也找不着一个摸“底”的好机会。
    有一天，他忽然接到一个通知，要他到县上参加党员集训班。他心里打了个冷战，想着这准是要受什么批评处分了，去呢还是不去？后来他想着还是去吧！到那里还可顺便摸摸“底”。
            一场思想战斗
    在去县里的路上，他想出了很多摸“底”的办法：听听讲课，看看上级的态度，问问邻村的干部有没有不愿干的。……
    集训班开始，县委书记等负责同志讲话时，他也就没用心听。他想反正是那一套！但在讲到社会必然要发展到共产主义社会，那个社会怎么好，他的思想动了。他想：噢，原来还有这么个社会，可比我现在的小光景好的多呀！不过他又想：真会有那一天吗？
    听了五六天课以后，他知道了要是好好领导群众生产，很好地组织劳动互助，组织合作社，就能把农业生产一天天的提高。城市的工业生产也在一天天提高。这样共产主义社会不就可以来到了！可是这个社会虽好，却不能一下就到呀！究竟这个干部是当还是不当呢？这个问题在他脑子里怎么也放不下去。下午游戏他也玩不下去，夜里觉也睡不着，白天上课也听不进。他老想清清静静地好好想一会，有人大声说句话他也讨厌。总是不停地想着：现在虽然没有敌人直接烧杀了，但是革命还没有成功；自己生活虽然好了，但离更好的社会还远着哩！要是生产不用领导，老乡们谁肯拨工？要是不要上级计划，让群众随便种庄稼，谁知道种棉花对发展工业有这么大的关系……怕犯错误受批评吧，如果你真心要为群众办好事，就是有点错误，上级和群众批评批评，也是为着自己好，为着工作好呀！想到这里，他就有劲了。但是他仍不能马上下决心好好工作。因为他又想到已是三十六岁的人啦，共产主义社会虽好，不一定能赶得上；再说远水不解近渴，要是担任工作就得误工，耽误生产，自己生活就受影响；与其如此，还是不担任工作好，有空了自己还能歇歇。但一会又回想起了：过去自己的想法常常不对，比如打蒋介石吧，最初，自己认为不能很快地打败他，可是党的领导同志说不久就可以打倒。结果就是这样了。共产主义社会只要我们努力，再加上苏联老大哥的帮助，也不会是太远的事，还是能赶上的。这样他又觉得还是要努力工作。
            找着了病根
    就在这样革命利益，个人利益，长远利益和眼前利益，农民思想，共产主义思想……在他脑子里激烈斗争的时候，在讲课中他又听到了“每个党员要坚定革命人生观，反对半截革命论。”这话像一根钢针正刺中他的痛处。他不自觉地打了个冷战。他这才想明白了：“原来我是个半截革命论者。我不愿担任工作就是革命人生观不坚定的过。这个思想在共产党员说来真是大错特错了。今后可不能再错下去了。”于是张振卿下定决心要努力工作了。他在受训中就做好了工作和生产结合的小计划。
    受完训回村后，他不但积极地把自己的工作做好，还给别的党员讲解自己学习的经过。他说今后可得好好学习。村里的人也都在奇怪的说：张振乡受了训练，不知得了什么好法宝，回来以后这样有劲！
