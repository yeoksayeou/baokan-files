Serious Criminal Act!
    A Major Embezzlement Case Occurred at the Wuhan Branch of the China Department Store Company
    Embezzlement Reached Over 200 Million Yuan; Principal and Accessories Have Been Arrested and Handed Over to the Court for Trial
    [Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] According to the Changjiang Daily news: A serious embezzlement case occurred at the Wuhan Branch of the China Department Store Company between September of last year and January of this year, causing a huge loss of state property. The principal and accessories, Xu Zhiping, Zhen Peilin, Zhu Junhua, Sun Nian, Peng Huaqing and others, have all been arrested and sent to the People's Court for trial. Among them, Peng Huaqing is a very unscrupulous businessman, the manager of the Huacheng Cloth Shop in Wuhan. In January, before the embezzlement case was discovered, the Huacheng Cloth Shop operated by the suspect was found by the tax bureau to have evaded more than 3 million yuan in temporary business tax. At that time, Peng not only did not know how to repent, but instead invited tax bureau staff to a bathhouse and bribed them with 600,000 yuan, hoping to escape punishment; the tax bureau staff were honest and upright and reported him on the spot. Later, the People's Court imposed a fine and ordered it to be paid in installments before February 13, and released him on bail on February 4 as a warning. It was at this time that the department store's major embezzlement case was finally revealed. Peng Huaqing not only failed to pay the aforementioned fine, but also, on the night of February 13 when the deadline expired, moved all the inventory in the store and fled to Yueyang, Hunan, hoping to write off both crimes with one stroke and escape the people's net. At this point, the People's Court ordered Peng's guarantor to hand Peng over to the authorities. Two days later, Peng Huaqing secretly returned to Hankou from Yueyang, and on the 21st, he was finally arrested. The transferred and dispersed cloth has also been identified and frozen. According to the preliminary confessions of these criminals, the embezzlement of various materials, converted at the mid-February market price plus cash, amounted to more than 200 million yuan.
            Living a Decadent and Corrupt Life Despite Repeated Warnings
    The case occurred last year. In October, the warehouse of the Trust Company affiliated with the Wuhan Department Store Company discovered that two machines of foreign yarn were missing, which was not initially investigated. It was only discovered that warehouse keeper Zhen Peilin and accountant Xu Zhiping of the department store company were living corrupt lives, frequently visiting prostitutes, eating at restaurants, watching movies and operas. Although they were advised, educated and urged to reflect and repent, it was ineffective. Later, Zhen Peilin was expelled in November for making mistakes, and Xu Zhiping was still retained. On January 30 of this year, when the company settled accounts with the People's Bank, it was discovered that 53.4 million yuan had been overdrawn. After checking the checks, one of the checks was for 57 million yuan, while the stub was for 3.6 million yuan. The clerk, Sun Nian, who cashed the check, was immediately pursued. Sun Nian confessed that the warehouse accountant Xu Zhiping had exchanged it with 3.6 million yuan in cash. At this time, Xu had not been to the company for two days. After consulting with the 11th sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, an inspection of the home of singer Jiao Shuliang in Huazhongli resulted in the recovery of 11.5 million yuan in cash that had not yet been squandered, and 22 taels of gold purchased with the embezzled money. With the stolen goods and evidence in place, the criminal Xu Zhiping had no reason to shirk responsibility and confessed to the fact of altering the check and fraudulently obtaining public funds. On February 8, the Public Security Bureau handed over the suspect and the stolen goods to the People's Court for handling. According to the confessions of the criminals in court:
            Colluding with Illegal Merchants to Steal and Sell State Property
    In September of last year, Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin squandered the warehouse's regular reserve fund of 750,000 yuan due to their decadent and corrupt lives. They jointly discussed falsely reporting 200,000 yuan in dock labor costs, and accepted bribes of 200,000 silver dollars from Weiminji Construction Factory and 300,000 yuan in kickbacks from Wuhan Printing House. With the embezzled income, they went to singer Jiao Shuliang's house every night with Zhu Junhua, a retained employee of Xinhua Cement Company, to support the venue, eat at restaurants, and go to theaters, indulging in extravagant entertainment. In early October, Xu Zhiping and Zhen Peilin discussed altering the warehouse's delivery slips. Using Xu Zhiping's familiarity with Peng Huaqing, the manager of Huacheng Cloth Shop, they handed the delivery slip to Peng Huaqing to pick up one machine of Golden Chrysanthemum brand foreign yarn and sell it at 65% of the market price. Xu Zhiping received 300,000 yuan and Zhen Peilin received 250,000 yuan. Subsequently, from October of last year to the end of the year, the two jointly discussed altering the warehouse delivery slips and successively stole and sold a large number of foreign yarn, cloth, toothpaste and other items from the warehouse, selling them to Peng Huaqing at 60% or 65% of the price. According to the two's confessions alone, they altered the delivery slips and stole and sold materials more than six times. The identified items include three machines of foreign yarn, 285 pieces of various cloths such as Four Gentlemen Serge and Student Blue, and 30 boxes of Samsung toothpaste, with a value of 150 million yuan in Renminbi at the mid-February market price. In addition to the two sharing the embezzled money, they also gave Zhu Junhua more than 2 million yuan and gave Peng Huaqing, the receiver of stolen goods, 20 pieces of First Grade Blue Cloth and Big Bell Blue Cloth free of charge.
            Unauthorized Alteration of Bank Checks to Fraudulently Obtain Huge Amounts of Public Funds
    On January 20 of this year, Zhen Peilin and Zhu Junhua wrote a letter to Xu Zhiping to borrow money for Spring Festival expenses (note: after Zhen Peilin was dismissed from the company at the end of November last year, he repeatedly borrowed money from Xu Zhiping. Zhu Junhua also sometimes borrowed money from Xu, threatening to report the embezzlement to the company if he did not agree.) Xu had no money at the time, so he discussed with Zhen at Zhu Junhua's house about altering the check to fraudulently obtain public funds. On January 24, he told Sun Nian, a clerk at the department store company, that the check could be exchanged for a discount of 1%. He exchanged a check for paying water and electricity fees with 3.6 million yuan in cash. At Jiao Shuliang's house (note: Xu Zhiping actually moved to Jiao's house in January of this year, and Zhen Peilin had also purchased a prostitute with embezzled money to live with), he used erasing liquid to remove the original face value of 3.6 million yuan and changed it to 57 million yuan, and withdrew the cash from the People's Bank. Later, he sent 180,000 yuan to Sun Nian, saying it was the discount money of 360,000 yuan for the check, which the two divided equally. That afternoon, he sent 7 million yuan to Zhen Peilin and Zhu Junhua. In addition to Jiao Shuliang and himself purchasing three radios and Western-style furniture, clothing, etc., with the remaining 50 million yuan, he also entrusted Jiao Shuliang's grandfather, Jiao Dehong, to purchase 22 taels of gold. Together with the 11.5 million yuan in cash, it was all handed over to Jiao Shuliang for safekeeping. This embezzlement was discovered when the company and the bank reconciled their accounts.
    The total amount of the aforementioned embezzled funds and materials amounted to more than 200 million yuan, equivalent to approximately 50,000 units of goods, which is equivalent to the full-month package treatment of 1,000 employees of government agencies. It can sustain the annual life of 100 working cadres.
            Leadership Paralysis and Chaotic Systems; the Company Should Inspect Its Work
    From this incident itself, it can also be seen that the company's leadership is paralyzed, there is no proper management and education in the use of retained personnel, and although their corruption and decadence have been discovered, no good measures have been taken to stop it. The work system is also extremely chaotic, resulting in the loss of more than 280 pieces of cloth from the warehouse, which was never discovered until the final reconciliation of the checks revealed Xu Zhiping's embezzlement. The cloth was only discovered when it reached the court, causing irreparable losses to the state's finances.
    After repeated trials, the facts of the case have become clear. The People's Court has printed and distributed the materials of the entire case to cadres of various organs and enterprises in the city to widely展开 [zhǎn kāi]展开 [zhǎn kāi]展開 [zhǎn kāi]展開 [zhǎn kāi]展開 [zhǎn kāi]展开 discussions. In order to thoroughly try this case, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government has ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to immediately send personnel to the Wuhan Branch of the China Department Store Company to conduct further inspections of this embezzlement case. In accordance with the spirit of Article 18 of the Common Program of the CPPCC, the People's Government will severely punish such bad elements who violate the honest and simple work style of state organs, embezzle and become corrupt, and cause huge losses to state property.

　　严重犯罪行为！
    华中百货公司武汉分公司发生严重贪污巨案
    贪污达两亿元以上，主从犯均已逮交法院审理
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：华中百货公司武汉分公司，于去年九月至今年一月间，发生严重贪污巨案，造成国家财产巨大损失。主从犯徐志平、镇沛霖、朱浚华、孙年、彭华卿等人，全部逮捕在案，送交人民法院审理中。其中彭华卿是一个非常不法的商人，为武汉市华成布店经理。在元月间，当贪污案未发觉前，该犯所经营的华成布店，曾因偷漏临时商业税三百余万元，被税务局查出。当时，彭不惟不知悔改，反而邀请税局工作人员至一澡堂，行贿六十万元，冀图幸免；税局工作人员廉洁奉公，当场予以检举；后由人民法院处以罚款，限二月十三日前，分期缴清，先行觅保，于二月四日释放，以为惩戒。正是这个时候，百货公司的大贪污案终于揭发。而彭华卿不仅不缴清前述罚款，更于期满的二月十三日晚上，将店中存货搬运一空，潜逃至湖南岳阳，妄想两罪一笔勾掉，逃脱人民的法网。至此，人民法院乃责令彭之保人交彭到案。两日后，彭华卿复由岳阳潜回汉口，二十一日，终于落网。至转移分散的布匹，也都分别查明，予以冻存。据这些罪犯初步供出，计贪污各种物资，按二月中旬市价折合加上现款达两亿元以上。
            生活堕落腐化屡经告诫不改
    该案发生于去年，十月间武汉市百货公司所属信托公司仓库，发觉缺少洋纱两台，初未查出。只发现百货公司仓库保管员镇沛霖会计徐志平生活腐化，时常狎妓、吃馆子、看电影、看戏，虽经劝告教育促其省悔，但亦无效。后镇沛霖犯错误十一月间开除，徐志平仍继续留用。至本年元月三十日，该公司与人民银行结账时，发现多提出现款五千三百四十万元，经核对支票其中一支票是五千七百万元，而存根上是三百六十万元。当即追出持支票提款的事务员孙年，孙年供出是仓库会计徐志平以现款三百六十万元换去的。此时徐已两日未到公司办公，经会同公安十一分局至华中里歌女焦淑良家检查结果，追回未及挥霍之现款一千一百五十万元，及赃款购买之黄金二十二两。赃证俱在，罪犯徐志平自无理由推诿，乃供出涂改支票，骗取公款事实。公安局于二月八日，将人犯连同赃证解送人民法院审办。据该犯等在法院口供：
            勾结非法商人盗卖国家财物
    去年九月间，徐志平与镇沛霖二人，因生活腐化堕落，将该仓库经常预备费七十五万元挥霍殆尽，即共同商议虚报码头力资二十万元，并收受伟民记营造厂贿赂银币二十万元，武汉印刷社回扣三十万元，以贪污所得，每晚约同新华水泥公司留用职员朱浚华同至歌女焦淑良家捧场，吃馆子，上剧院，花天酒地。十月初徐志平与镇沛霖商议涂改仓库中提单，利用徐志平与华成布店经理彭华卿熟识关系，将提单交与彭华卿提出金菊牌洋纱一抬，照市价六五折售出，徐志平分得三十万元，镇沛霖分得二十五万元。继后从去年十月至年终，二人共同商量涂改仓库提单，从仓库中先后盗卖大批洋纱、布匹、牙膏等物，以六折或六五折，卖与彭华卿，仅据二人口供，先后涂改提货单，盗卖物资即在六次以上。已查明者计有洋纱三抬、四君子哔叽、学生蓝等各种布匹二百八十五匹，三星牙膏三十罗，以二月中旬市价折合，计值人民币一亿五千万元之巨，所得赃款除二人分用外，又给予朱浚华二百多万元，无偿赠予赃主彭华卿一品蓝布及大钟蓝布各二十匹。
            擅改银行支票骗取巨额公款
    至本年元月二十日，镇沛霖与朱浚华写信向徐志平借款，作为春节用费，（按：去年十一月底，镇沛霖被公司开除后，仍屡向徐志平借钱。朱浚华有时也向徐借款，如不允诺，即以贪污情事报告公司为要挟。）徐一时无款，乃与镇在朱浚华家中商议涂改支票，骗取公款，于一月二十四日向百货公司庶务孙年谓：支票可换出百分之一的贴水，以三百六十万元现款，掉换缴水电费支票一张，在焦淑良家，（按徐志平竟于本年元月搬至焦家，镇沛霖亦已用赃款购一妓女姘居）用退墨精退出原来三百六十万元票面，改为五千七百万元，至人民银行提出现款。后送十八万元与孙年，说是支票贴水钱三十六万元，二人均分。当日下午送七百万元给镇沛霖、朱浚华，余五千万元除焦淑良及其本人购收音机三部及西装家具衣物外，并托焦淑良祖父焦德洪购买黄金二十二两。连同现款一千一百五十万元，一并交焦淑良保管。此次贪污，被公司与银行对账时查出。
    上述之贪污之款物，总计达两亿以上。折合实物单位约五万分，相等于一千个机关人员的全月包干待遇。可维持一百个工作干部的全年生活。
            领导麻痹制度紊乱该公司应检查工作
    从此一事件本身上，也可看出该公司领导上的麻痹，对留用人员使用，无适当管理教育，虽已发觉其腐化堕落，仍未能以很好措施使其停止，而工作制度亦极度混乱，致仓库损失布二百八十余匹，一直均未发现，直到最后核对支票始知徐志平贪污，布匹到法院才查出，造成国家财政上不可弥补之损失。
    此案迭经审讯，事实已臻明确，人民法院并将全案材料印发全市各机关企业组织干部，广泛展开讨论。武汉市人民政府为彻底审理此一案件，已责令市公安总局即速派员前往华中百货公司武汉分公司，对此贪污案件作进一步之检查。根据政协共同纲领第十八条精神，人民政府对此等违反国家机关人员廉洁朴素作风，贪污腐化，使国家财富遭受巨大损失之恶劣分子，将予以严厉惩罚。
