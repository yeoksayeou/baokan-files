　　Overseas Chinese Leader Ding Baojing Tragically Assassinated by Siamese Police Detective
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th] Siam News: Ding Baojing, a leader of the Overseas Chinese in Phitsanulok, northern Siam, was assassinated by a Siamese police detective on February 18th. Ding Baojing was the chairman of the Overseas Chinese National Construction and Homeland Salvation Association in Phitsanulok, and also the chairman of the board of directors of the Jianmin School, which was run by the Overseas Chinese in the city. Under Ding's leadership, Jianmin School achieved excellent results and was supported by the majority of Overseas Chinese, and was therefore regarded as a thorn in the side by the local Siamese authorities. Last year, the city's police repeatedly instructed landlords to take back the school buildings, attempting to force Jianmin School to close down by this method. Ding immediately led the fundraising to build a new school building. After the school building was completed, but the funds were still short of a portion, Ding then requested the local administrative officer on February 1st of this year to hold a Spring Festival lion dance to raise funds for the school, but was unreasonably rejected by the local police chief inspector. On February 12th, the police chief inspector suddenly notified Ding again, allowing the lion dance to raise funds. On the evening of February 18th, the electricity near the school was suddenly interrupted. At this time, Ding was talking about the fundraising situation at a friend's house. At 7:40 pm, there were several loud gunshots, and Ding fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The murderer used a No. 12 shotgun to shoot into the room from outside the door, hitting Ding's head in four places and his chest in one place. Ding died on the spot. By the time the police arrived, it was 8:20, and the murderer had already fled. The police chief who arrived at the scene did not ask about the circumstances of the deceased's murder, but threatened the Overseas Chinese present, saying: "Who else dares to be a leader?" The suspect who was arrested that night was also released by the police station the next day on the pretext of "mental disorder." These facts clearly indicate the relationship between this assassination and the local Siamese police.

　　华侨领袖丁宝镜惨遭暹警探暗杀
    【新华社北京五日电】暹罗讯：暹罗北部彭世洛埠华侨领袖丁宝镜于二月十八日在当地被暹罗警探暗杀。丁宝镜为彭世洛埠华侨建国救乡会主席，并为该埠华侨主办之建民学校校董会主席。建民学校在丁主持下，成绩优异，受到广大侨胞拥护，因而被当地暹罗官方视为眼中钉。去年该埠警察曾屡次指示地主收回校舍，企图以此办法压迫建民学校停办。丁即领导筹款建筑新校舍。后校舍落成，但经费尚短缺一部分，丁遂于本年二月一日向当地行政长官要求举办春节舞狮，为学校筹款，但被当地警察总巡无理拒绝。迨至二月十二日，警察总巡忽又匆匆通知丁，允许舞狮筹款。十八日晚学校附近电流忽然中断，此时丁正在友人家中谈此次募款情形，至七时四十分钟，忽有枪声轰然数响，丁应声倒于血泊中。凶徒系以十二号猎枪从门外向室内射击，计击中丁头部四处，胸部一处，丁当场逝世。待警察到时，已是八点二十分，凶徒早已逃去。到场的警长不问死者被杀情形，却向在场华侨威胁称：“你们再有谁敢作领袖？”当晚拘获的嫌疑犯，也在第二天被警局借口“神经失常”释放。这些事实清楚指明这次暗杀案与当地暹罗警察的关系。
