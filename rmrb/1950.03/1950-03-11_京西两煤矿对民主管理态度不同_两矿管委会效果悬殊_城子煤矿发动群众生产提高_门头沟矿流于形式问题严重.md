According to the Workers' Daily: The Chengzimei Coal Mine and the Mentougou Coal Mine in the Mentougou Mining Area of western Beijing both established worker-mine management committees in November of last year. Prior to the establishment, both mines conducted more than half a month of publicity and preparation. The number of members of the mine management committees in both mines was seventeen, including eight ex-officio members such as the mine director, supervisors, two engineers, the chief of the engineering section, the chief of the personnel section, the director of the electromechanical group, and the director of the trade union, and nine members elected by the workers and staff (the secretary of the CCP branch was also elected as a member). After four months, the Chengzimei Mine Management Committee achieved better results. The mine administration and the trade union, through this organization of the management committee, mobilized the masses and solved many problems among the masses, thereby increasing production. On the contrary, the Mentougou Mine Management Committee has remained an empty shell to this day, and has not actually played any role. Many of the problems that existed in the factory in the past are still very serious today.

Prior to the establishment of the worker-mine management committee at Chengzimei Mine, there was a very serious problem in the mine, namely, the lack of unity between the administration and the trade union, each going its own way. The mine believed that the trade union was not playing a role, and did not consult with the trade union in making or carrying out any decisions. The trade union's production perspective was also not clear, and it simply emphasized carrying out cultural and recreational activities and studies. The opinions of the mine and the trade union often differed, and sometimes they even blamed each other. For example, in October of last year, more than 100 workers were slightly or seriously injured underground, and the mine and the trade union did not jointly review the work, but instead shirked responsibility to each other. Since the establishment of the management committee, the administration and the trade union have both conducted self-criticisms, established a system of regular criticism and self-criticism, and established a standing committee of the management committee (the mine director, the branch secretary, and the director of the trade union). The standing committee met every day to discuss and promptly resolve the problems that occurred in the mine. At the same time, because the management committee included members elected by the workers and staff, the rationalization proposals of the workers and staff and the demands for mass welfare could be quickly collected, discussed, and implemented. For example, the wage difference between temporary workers and permanent workers was too large, which affected the unity between workers; this was adjusted after a decision by the management committee. In addition, the management committee also abolished the unreasonable system in the past where staff members could rest for three days without deduction of wages, while workers would have their wages deducted for three hours of leave, and changed it to the same wage deduction for staff and workers for not working. On November 25th of last year, the management committee decided to establish a safety committee, which would go down the mine every week to inspect safety equipment. As a result, the number of injuries gradually decreased. The mine had two serious injuries and 109 minor injuries in December, which was reduced by half in January. In terms of inventions and innovations, it was difficult to be adopted before the establishment of the management committee, which made workers reluctant to propose them. After the establishment of the management committee, every time a major production task was completed, the discussion and evaluation of the masses was relied upon to find out the models that were truly supported by the masses. This has continuously improved the production enthusiasm of the workers, and inventions and innovations have gradually increased. The Nanxie shaft originally used three-inch air pipes, which could no longer be used and needed to be replaced with five-inch pipes. The engineer planned to disassemble and install 700 meters of pipe, which would take at least 48 hours. If disassembled and installed during working hours, it would affect two full days of coal production. After the management committee mobilized everyone to discuss, everyone was willing to give up the New Year's holiday to rest and install the air pipes, so that the entire month's production plan was not affected. The pieceworkers underground used the retreating longwall method of coal mining instead of using sheds for small coal seams, which not only ensured the safety of the workers, but also resulted in cleaner coal extraction. Due to the adoption of this method, the cost of coal at the mine was reduced by 16%. If the daily coal output is 500 tons, 7,500 catties of millet can be saved per day.

Since the establishment of the worker-mine management committee at the Mentougou Mine, the administration, the Party branch, and the trade union have all not paid attention to the management committee. The management committee has nothing to do, and has only held two meetings from its establishment to the present. The administration and the trade union in the mine were originally uncoordinated. Now, the administration emphasizes being busy with work and having no time when handling many matters, and sometimes does not notify the trade union, and is unwilling to discuss matters at the management committee. For example, in January, the mine dismissed more than 100 temporary workers, and in February, it transferred 13 staff members to Liangxiang and three staff members to the Heishan Mine. The mine did not notify the trade union in advance or after these matters, until the dismissed members found the trade union, the trade union learned about it, and the administration did not mention it to the management committee for discussion. For example, the mine's 1950 production plan was not studied and discussed by the management committee, but was only conveyed at the workers' representative meeting. Due to the lack of harmony between the mine and the trade union, and the management committee not playing its due role, the administration has become isolated, the trade union has become inactive, the production enthusiasm of the workers has not been brought into play, and the problems existing in the mine are still serious.

### 京西两煤矿对民主管理态度不同  两矿管委会效果悬殊  城子煤矿发动群众生产提高  门头沟矿流于形式问题严重

　　京西两煤矿对民主管理态度不同
    两矿管委会效果悬殊
    城子煤矿发动群众生产提高
    门头沟矿流于形式问题严重
    【本报讯】据工人日报消息：京西门头沟矿区城子煤矿和门头沟煤矿，去年十一月间，都成立了工矿管理委员会。成立前，两矿都开展了半个多月的宣传酝酿。两矿管委会委员的人数都是十七人，包括矿长、监委、两个工程师、工务股长、人事股长、机电组主任和工会主任等八个当然委员，和由职工中间选举出来的九个委员（中共支部书记也被选为委员）。经过四个月后，城子矿管理委员会搞的较有成绩。该矿的行政、工会通过管委会这个机构，发动了群众，并解决了许多群众中间的问题，提高了生产。相反，门头沟矿管委会，到今天却只保持着一付空架子，实际上没有起什么作用。从前该厂存在的许多问题，今天依然很严重。
    城子矿在未成立工矿管理委员会以前，矿里存在着一个很严重的问题，就是行政和工会不团结，各行其是。矿方认为工会不起作用，在决定或进行任何事情，都不和工会商量。而工会的生产观点也不明确，单纯的强调搞文娱，搞学习。矿方和工会的意见时常分歧，有时甚至互相埋怨。像去年十月间，井下工人负轻重伤的有一百多人，矿方和工会并不共同检讨工作，却是互相推卸责任。自从建立管委会后，行政和工会都作了检讨，规定了定期的批评检讨制度，并建立了管委会的常务委员会（矿长、支书及工会主任）。常委每天碰头，共同商量，及时解决了矿里所发生的问题。同时因管委会中有职工选出的委员，对于工人群众的合理化建议和群众福利方面的要求，都能很快的搜集、讨论和付诸实行。如：临时工和里工的工资差别太大，影响工人之间的团结；经过管委会的决定，作了调整。此外，管委会还取消了以前职员休息三天、不扣工资，而工人请假三小时即扣工资的不合理制度，改为职员工人不上班同样扣工资。去年十一月二十五日，管委会又决定成立安全委员会，每星期下井检查一次安全设备。因此，受伤事件便逐渐减少。该矿十二月份重伤二人，轻伤一○九人，到一月份，就减少了一半。在创造发明方面，管委会成立以前，很难被采用，使工人也不愿提出了。管委会成立后，工人每完成一桩大的生产任务，就依靠群众的讨论和评选，找出真正为群众拥护的模范来。使工人生产情绪不断提高，创造发明也就逐渐多起来了。南斜井原用的是三寸风管，因为不能用了，需要换成五寸的管子，工程师计划拆装七百米长的管，至少要用四十八小时，如果在工作时间拆装，便会影响两整天的出煤。经管委会发动大家讨论后，大家宁愿放弃阳历年的假日休息，装好了风管，使全月的生产计划未受影响。井下件工对小层煤不使棚子，改用了后退式的长壁法造煤，不但保障了工人安全，而且吃煤吃得净，由于采用了这个办法，该矿煤的成本减低了百分之十六。如以每天出煤五百吨计，一天便可节省七千五百斤小米。
    门头沟矿自从成立了工矿管理委员会以后，行政、党支部和工会对管委会都不重视，管委会没有事可做，从成立到现在只开过两次会。该矿行政和工会本来就不协调，现在行政上在处理很多事情时，就强调工作忙，没有时间，有时还是不通知工会，并不愿在管委会上讨论。例如一月份矿方解雇了一百多个临时工人，二月又把十三个职员调良乡，三个职员调往黑山矿。这些事矿方在事先事后都没有通知工会，直到被解雇的会员们找到工会，工会才知道了这回事，行政也没有提到管委会进行讨论。又如该矿一九五○年的生产计划，也未经过管委会研究讨论，只在职工代表会上传达了一下。由于矿方和工会的关系不融洽，管委会又未起应有的作用，便形成了行政上的孤立，工会消沉，工人的生产积极性没有得到发挥，矿上存在的问题依然严重。
