　　“Strive to Exceed Ten Percent!”
    The Nineteenth District Holds Expanded Cadre Meeting
    To Convey This Year's Agricultural Production Plan
    [Our Newspaper] The Nineteenth District of Beijing held an expanded cadre meeting on the 21st and 22nd to convey and discuss the district's 1950 production plan. During the discussion, everyone was full of confidence in increasing production by ten percent, and some villages even proposed that they could exceed ten percent. This is because this year: (1) After the land reform, the farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high. "In the past, landlords hoed the land once, but this year we will hoe it three times." (2) The People's Government is leading in a planned way "to open more canals and increase yields." (3) The cooperative is organizing the pulling of mud from ditches, and with manure, production can be increased.
    On the 22nd, the Public Security Bureau Chief gave a report on "Stopping winter defense work, fully safeguarding production, and exposing rumors hindering production." Finally, Comrade Chang Pu, the District Party Committee Secretary, called on Party and League members and village cadres to take the lead actively, unite all the villagers, and strive "to ensure a ten percent increase in production, produce 81,580 *shi* more, and strive to exceed ten percent."

　　“争取超过一成！”
    十九区开扩大干部会议
    传达今年农业生产计划
    【本报讯】京郊十九区于二十一、二两日召开扩大干部会议，传达并讨论了全区一九五○年的生产计划。在讨论中，大家对增产一成，都充满信心，有的村并提出能超过一成。因为今年：（一）土地改革后，农民的生产情绪非常高涨，“过去地主锄一遍，我们今年要锄三遍”。（二）人民政府有计划地领导“多开水渠，增加收成”。（三）合作社组织拉沟泥，有了粪就能增产。
    二十二日公安分局长作了“停止冬防工作，全力保卫生产，揭破了妨碍生产的谣言”的报告。最后区委书记常浦同志号召党、团员，村干部应积极带头，团结全村农民，为“保证增产一成，多打八一五八石，并争取超过一成”而奋斗。（十九区李政）
