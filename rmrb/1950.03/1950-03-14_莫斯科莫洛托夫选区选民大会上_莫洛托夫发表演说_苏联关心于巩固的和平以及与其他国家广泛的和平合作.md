Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th (TASS): Molotov delivered a speech at the voters' meeting in the Molotov constituency of Moscow on the 10th, as follows:

Comrades! I sincerely thank you for your trust in nominating me as your candidate for the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

I first regard the honor you have given me as a manifestation of your trust in our great Communist Party, and trust in those Communists who are infinitely loyal to the Party. (Applause)

For the prosperity of our country and the happiness of the Soviet people, I am now and will continue to be ready to be loyal to and do my best to implement the will of the great Lenin and Stalin party, and dedicate all my energy to the country. (Long applause)

Comrades! The current election campaign gives us an opportunity to review what the Soviet Union has achieved in the years since the end of World War II.

**All Major Sectors of the Soviet National Economy are Progressing Victoriously**

Four years ago, Comrade Stalin, when talking about the first post-war five-year plan, emphasized two basic tasks. First, he pointed out the task of restoring the damaged areas and restoring industry and agriculture to pre-war levels, and then substantially raising them above this level. He also emphasized another important task: to improve the living standards of the Soviet working people. He also summarized this unwavering policy, namely, to abolish the rationing system, maximize the production of consumer goods, and gradually reduce the prices of various commodities. These two tasks are the basis of the first post-war five-year plan.

You have now seen the implementation of these two tasks.

Reviving those Soviet regions ravaged by the aggressors is of great importance to us. It is enough to say that in those areas occupied by the enemy, the output of industrial products accounted for one-third of the country's total industrial output before the war, and the sown area in these areas accounted for almost half of the country's sown area. The restoration work carried out in these areas has produced remarkable results.

Regarding the entire national economy, in all its basic sectors, we have not only reached but also exceeded the pre-war level.

In agriculture, the total output last year exceeded the pre-war level. Just last year, the harvest of grains, cotton, flax, sunflower seeds and potatoes, as well as the number of collectively owned livestock such as cattle, sheep and pigs, exceeded the best pre-war years. The food problem has now been solved. We now have an adequate food supply, including the necessary reserves. The completion of the three-year plan for the development of livestock breeding, which was adopted last year, will increase the amount of meat, butter, eggs, milk and other dairy and meat products to such an extent that we will be able to ensure that the supply to the people in 1951 will increase by at least 50 percent compared to 1948.

The government is taking important steps to provide more assistance to agriculture. In 1949, agriculture received three to four times more tractors, motorcycles and agricultural machinery than in 1940 before the war.

However, the main thing is that all our 254,000 collective farms have become stronger, and now there are many model collective farms with high levels of mechanization and labor productivity. Among the men and women collective farmers, thousands of advanced farmers are emerging, who have won medals and the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

As early as 1948, our industry had reached and exceeded the pre-war level. In 1949, it exceeded the pre-war level by 41 percent, which is close to the figure of 48 percent stipulated in the five-year plan for its last year to exceed the pre-war level. In the fourth quarter of last year, our industry exceeded the level stipulated for the fifth year, i.e. this year, of the five-year plan. The total industrial production of Russia (referring to the Russian Federal Republic) was worth 16 billion rubles before the revolution in 1913; but in the past two years, the value of industrial production has increased by 32 to 34 billion rubles per year, which is equal to twice the total industrial output before the revolution.

In the first four years after the war, 5,200 state-owned industrial enterprises were established, restored and put into production, not counting the small ones. These enterprises now employ 1.5 million workers, engineers, technicians and staff. For example, the scale of basic construction in industry last year was almost twice that of the best pre-war year. Construction increases year by year. This means that a further and more powerful development of Soviet industry has been guaranteed.

Most importantly: the mass movement to further promote industrial development and improve the quality of industrial products has now been joined by most of the workers, foremen, technicians and engineers, and this mass movement is increasingly expanding in industry and transportation, and also in agriculture.

In this way, all major sectors of our national economy are progressing victoriously, completing and exceeding the plans formulated by Comrade Stalin and the provisions of the first post-war five-year plan. (Enthusiastic applause)

**The Welfare of the Working People is Constantly Improving**

The implementation of the second task put forward by Comrade Stalin in the last election campaign has also achieved considerable success.

In terms of improving the living standards of urban and rural working people, we have achieved significant success in the past four years. The policy of reducing consumer goods prices and abolishing the rationing system started at the same time. The price reductions implemented in 1947 and 1949 saved the people 157 billion rubles. Last year, the people's consumption of the most important goods exceeded the pre-war level.

As a result of increased labor productivity and reduced production costs, the Party and the government issued a resolution on March 1 to implement the third price reduction for a large number of goods most needed by the people. The prices of bread, meat and butter were reduced by 25 to 30 percent; textiles and shoes were reduced by about 15 to 20 percent; and the prices of some items were reduced by as much as 40 to 50 percent. This price reduction will benefit the people by at least 110 billion rubles throughout the year. This is because prices are reduced in our country while maintaining the existing wage levels, maintaining pensions and scholarships, and not changing the government's purchase prices of agricultural products.

From the published figures, it can now be known that the income of industrial workers and staff in 1949 increased by 20 percent compared to 1940. During the same period, the income of farmers increased by more than 30 percent. The total national income of the Soviet Union in 1949 increased by 36 percent compared to 1940. Due to the further reduction in consumer goods prices implemented on March 1, the real wages of industrial workers and staff will be greatly increased again, and the cost of farmers purchasing industrial products will be greatly reduced again. As prices decrease, the purchasing power of the ruble and its exchange rate with the US dollar, British pound and other foreign currencies will greatly increase. This is at a time when the incomes of workers in the United States and other capitalist countries are declining year by year due to rising prices. This is at a time when the incomes of American farmers fell by 17 percent last year, and the currencies of capitalist countries are depreciating sharply. From this, it can be understood why the bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Europe want to keep silent about the news published in our newspapers about the brilliant achievements of the Soviet national economic plan in 1949; and it can also be understood why those newspapers are so embarrassed as to use boring tricks in reporting on our country's new price reductions, trying every means to distort the true significance of this measure, which is so important to the working people. The newspapers of the bourgeoisie and the newspapers of the pseudo-socialist running dogs are obviously afraid to talk about the facts that clearly show the great progress of the Soviet Union. (Applause)

Our national economy, first of all the driving force of the national economy - socialist industry, is growing year after year following the law of the steady development of the socialist economy. This law has been established in the Soviet state. At the same time, the welfare of the working people is constantly improving. This is the fundamental difference between the Soviet state and all countries belonging to the capitalist camp. The continuous increase in the living standards is also one of the basic laws of the economic development of the Soviet socialist state.

Does this mean that we can be satisfied with our achievements? No, the Party and Comrade Stalin did not teach us this way. The Party requires each of us to make a systematic and bold critical review of our work. Comrade Stalin taught us that there is no progress without self-criticism, and we need self-criticism as much as we need air. Comrade Stalin wrote in a famous letter to Gorky: "We cannot live a day without self-criticism. Maximovich Aleksey, this is not possible. Without self-criticism, stagnation, machine corruption, bureaucracy will inevitably arise, and will undermine the creativity and initiative of the working class."

This passage was written twelve years ago. But it is fully applicable today.

Only when we, in a Bolshevik style, boldly expose the shortcomings and errors in our work; only when we rely on the strong development of the country and are more serious about ourselves; only when we show that we are good at uniting the progressive forces and the entire Soviet people, and guiding them and all our people to strive to implement the tasks that the Party puts forward at different times according to the domestic and international situation, are we truly advancing. This determines the main tasks of all our party and non-party organizations, Soviets, trade unions and the Communist Youth League.

We now see that the economic recovery of the country, which began after the war, has now been basically completed, and our economic level has exceeded the pre-war level. We now have greater opportunities to solve important problems such as building houses. In the plan being drafted to expand the construction of the Soviet capital - Moscow, the greatest attention is paid to the construction of new houses, schools and hospitals. (All applauded)

We already have a strong industry capable of meeting the people's increasing need for goods. At the same time, our industry manufactures all kinds of machines, excellent and precise instruments and various technical treasures. We have reached such a situation that, on the basis of a broad national plan, we are organizing and adopting new equipment in all sectors of the national economy, especially in coal mines, loading and unloading of vehicles and ships, construction, logging, etc. If we organize this matter properly and make greater efforts to eliminate existing shortcomings, then we will greatly reduce the labor of our workers, greatly increase labor productivity in many currently backward industrial sectors, and create the necessary prerequisites for further reducing production costs and improving product quality.

Today, those who hold decisive positions and assume the main responsibilities in various labor sectors are Communists and other Soviet people who have rich practical experience and are fully trained. Our economic personnel are also increasing day by day. This is the result of the pre-war purge of Trotskyites, Bukharinites and other saboteurs sent to our enterprises and agencies by various spy agencies of imperialist countries - we must not forget this. Today, the total number of experts with diplomas from specialized schools and technical schools engaged in national economic work has increased by about 70 percent compared to 1940 before the war. Every year, the ranks of technical experts in industry, transportation and agriculture are supplemented by an increasing number of new forces every year. Therefore, we now have the opportunity to improve economic and technical leadership methods that we did not have before the war.

Comrade Stalin especially emphasized the necessity of further developing scientific research in the last election campaign. He then stipulated the task of our scientists as: "Not only to catch up with, but also to surpass the achievements of foreign science in the near future." Facts show that we have made victorious progress in this regard. It is enough to point out the fact that the number of Stalin Prize winners is increasing day by day.

**The Soviet Union's Defeat of German and Japanese Fascism Has Caused Major Changes in the International Situation**

Now, everyone can see how short-sighted the German and other fascists were when they attacked the Soviet Union, hoping to defeat the Soviet people and eliminate the Soviet state. Their minds did not realize in time that no fascist can do this, nor did they realize in time that the only end result of the fascist attack on the Soviet Union would be its own destruction. The Soviet people were the first to bear the brunt of World War II, but despite all the disasters and losses they suffered, they emerged from the war stronger, more powerful, and more confident in their strength than before. (Applause)

Even in those countries that were our allies during World War II, there were many politicians who built their plans on the assumption that the Soviet state would be severely weakened due to the enemy's occupation and the subsequent difficult situation of our people, so that the imperialists would be able to impose their will on the Soviet Union. These people are also too short-sighted. Their minds cannot understand the strength of a powerful socialist country like the Soviet Union, nor can they understand what the inexhaustible source of strength of the Soviet Union is. They do not understand the great significance of the fact that the Soviet Union is built on those new social factors that have not yet been understood but are actually capable of creating miracles, such as: the indestructible spiritual and political unity of socialist society, the brotherly friendship of all ethnic groups in the Soviet state, and the gradually growing Soviet patriotism of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party. (Stormy applause)

We do not need to be surprised that all kinds of reactionaries do not understand what kind of country the Soviet Union is, because they look backward instead of forward, because they cannot lift their heads like some kind of animal. (Laughter, applause)

Only when people remember that the Soviet Union was created by the greatest revolutionary, Lenin, and is being led by the glorious leader, our Stalin, will they correctly understand us - our people, and will they appropriately assess the historical position of the Soviet Union, considering it to be the decisive progressive force of our era. (The speech was interrupted by stormy and prolonged applause, and the whole audience stood up)

The victory over German fascism and Japanese imperialism, and the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in defeating these aggressive forces, have caused major changes in the international situation.

Think about the changes that have taken place in the west of the Soviet Union. In Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, people's democratic countries have been established and have gained a solid foundation. Their rise is due to the defeat of fascism in Europe and the assistance of the Soviet army to the people of these countries in their national and social liberation. (Applause)

After winning freedom, the people of these countries overthrew the capitalist and landlord exploiting classes, and drove them out of the main positions, thereby establishing a people's democratic regime on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Workers' Party.

Before World War II, the running dogs of Britain, France, and the United States, or the running dogs of the German and Italian fascist countries, often played prominent roles in the governments of these countries, sometimes playing both roles at the same time. But today, the situation is completely different. Of course, it is not so easy to eliminate the running dogs of imperialism in small countries. The Rajk trial in Hungary, the Kostov trial in Bulgaria, and many other facts show that imperialists even send their running dogs - spies - into the leadership of the Communist Party, not to mention the bourgeois parties. When the people's democratic countries finally completed this necessary and justified task of destroying these spy nests, which had become havens for all kinds of subversives, saboteurs and terrorists, the ruling groups in the Americas and Europe attempted to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. Under the pretext of "protecting human rights," they made various threats and accusations, and took retaliatory actions, even severing diplomatic relations, as they recently did to Bulgaria. However, it is not difficult to understand that such aggressive actions are useless.

In the four years after the war, the people's democratic countries have clearly determined the further trend of their development. They have grown stronger and become countries that realize the function of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have embarked on the road of socialism, most vividly showing that the people of European countries have no other way to freedom and improved living standards other than resolutely transitioning to socialism. The bonds of friendship and mutual assistance closely link the Soviet Union with the people of the people's democratic countries.

The exposure of the vile betrayal of the Tito clique in Yugoslavia is of great constructive significance. Today, this criminal gang can no longer hide behind the mask of communism in its own country, and can no longer corrupt the ranks of sincere democrats and socialists in other countries. The people of Yugoslavia will naturally draw their own conclusions from the developments that have taken place.

Now let's talk about Germany. We have not yet been able to find a common language with our allies in World War II on this issue. The unilateral actions of the United States, Britain, and France have led to the division of the German nation, followed by the dismemberment of West Germany, the separation of the Saar region, and the separation of the industrial area of the Ruhr. This policy can only end in shameful failure.

The establishment of the German Democratic Republic, with Berlin as its capital, marks a new page not only in German history but also in European history. Comrade Stalin spoke very convincingly about this. He pointed out: "The coexistence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes it impossible for Europe to have a new war, ends the bloodshed in Europe and makes it impossible for world imperialists to enslave European countries." The sooner the German people recognize the true historical significance of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the sooner they will win their national unity, and the more solid the guarantee of a consolidated peace in Europe will be. (Applause)

**The Great Power of the Brotherly Alliance Between China and the Soviet Union is Unparalleled in Human History**

Now look to the East, and compare the current situation with that of several years ago.

Before World War II, there was only one democratic country in Asia - the Mongolian People's Republic. Now, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been established and is seeking complete national unification, and will undoubtedly achieve complete national unification. The great significance of the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also obvious.

It has only recently been seen that the most important result of the Allied victory over German fascism and Japanese imperialism is the victory of the Chinese national liberation movement. (Prolonged applause) The Chinese people's revolutionary movement under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has won a great victory, taking more than 20 years. To this day, under the leadership of their outstanding leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have established their own People's Republic. (Prolonged applause)

Following our October Revolution, the victory of the Chinese national liberation movement is another most powerful blow to the entire system of world imperialism and all current imperialist aggression plans. It is understandable that close friendly relations have been established between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The treaty of brotherly alliance signed between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in February has transformed the friendship between the two countries into a powerful force for consolidating universal peace, a force that is unparalleled and has never been matched in human history. (The speech was interrupted by a storm of applause)

It must also be stated that since World War II, major changes have also taken place in capitalist countries. In several capitalist countries, the Communist Party and the Workers' Party, if they have not already occupied a decisive position in the political development of the people, are carrying out victorious work in realizing this goal, and have reorganized their organizations in accordance with the principles of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism.

For many years after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country, surrounded by the hostile encirclement of capitalist countries. The imperialists used various tricks to try to strangle the Soviet Union. Churchill, a die-hard, reactionary and rampant member of the British Parliament, loudly reprimanded history in a speech in the British Parliament last year, because history did not "crush Bolshevism in its infancy." The Soviet Union has not only stood tall in its countless tests, but has also grown stronger in such struggles.

In World War II, the Soviet Union inflicted a devastating defeat on its most violent enemy.

After winning the war, and after gaining the opportunity to give effective assistance to the liberation wars of other countries, the Soviet Union finally broke away from its internationally isolated position. At present, the Soviet Union has not only broken away from its international isolation, but is also the core of a powerful international democratic camp that unites all people's democratic countries. In capitalist countries, we have millions of capable friends who are gradually moving closer to the ranks of the broad democratic anti-imperialist movement.

Under such new circumstances, especially after the formation of a solid anti-imperialist alliance between the Soviet people and the Chinese people - between the two largest countries in the world - the camp of peace, democracy and socialism has become the most unrespectable force. (Prolonged applause) This camp of peace and freedom is moving forward on a reliable road, a historically tested road; and the guarantee of this is that on its united banner is written the great name - Stalin. (Long and stormy cheers. All stood up, and the sound of cheers for Comrade Stalin resounded throughout the hall.)

**The Foundation of the Imperialist Camp Has Been Shaken; Soviet Industry is Further Powerfully Rising**

The democratic camp that unites the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is opposed by the camp of imperialist countries headed by the ruling groups in the United States.

Although the position of imperialism has proven to be shaken after World War II, the corrupt and dying capitalist regime is doomed to extinction. But imperialism is reluctant to die and will not willingly withdraw from history. On the contrary, it is trying to raise its head again and again. It is taking harsh steps to deal with progressive organizations and democratic movements. It is trying to hastily piece together various groups from the allies of the reactionary governments of other countries, and is wantonly engaging in preparations for new and more criminal acts of aggression, attempting to realize its dream of conquering the world. Paying close attention to the camp of imperialism is our constant task and important responsibility. Marxism teaches us that the fate of a country is first determined by the country's economic development. That is why we must pay special attention to the facts related to the economic situation in capitalist countries.

For example, take the facts about the United States - the current major capitalist power. American capitalists took advantage of World War II very cheaply. They expanded industry more than usual and filled their pockets. They also took advantage of the post-war difficulties in certain countries, especially the economic decline of defeated Germany, Italy and Japan, to dump their goods and put more gold into their pockets. But after the end of the war, the prosperity artificially created by American imperialist industry during the war (which had such great destruction for European and Asian countries) quickly came to an end. From the materials that have been published, everyone knows that American industry has fallen below the level of the war period in the past few years. Everyone also knows that industrial production was particularly reduced in October 1949, and the industrial level was reduced by 22 percent compared to the figure in October 1948.

And the level of Soviet industry in 1949 has risen by 20 percent. The 22 percent decrease in the United States indicates the economic crisis that has begun in the United States, and also indicates the economic crisis that is developing in all capitalist countries. The 20 percent increase in the Soviet Union indicates the further powerful rise of Soviet industry. (The speech was interrupted by applause)

What kind of predictions can we make about the prospects for the economic development of various countries in the two camps? Only the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which are following the socialist path and relying on the support of the Soviet Union, can give a clear answer to this question. In the last election campaign, Comrade Stalin stipulated the main direction of our country's economic development. He elucidated the principles of the economic plan within the time of three five-year plans or slightly more, stipulating "to raise the main task of our country's industrial level, for example, to raise it to three times the pre-war level."

Our first post-war five-year plan is now nearing completion. We see that our country is victoriously completing and over-fulfilling the work of this first post-war five-year plan.

**The Second Post-War Stalinist Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union is Being Drafted**

This year, we are drafting the second post-war five-year plan, which will begin in 1951. Naturally, this second and some of our later post-war five-year plans will also be Stalinist five-year plans, which explains its essence. (The speech was drowned out by applause)

Everyone knows that the realization of our economic plan raises the economy of our country to higher and higher levels, while constantly improving the welfare of the Soviet people. We understand very clearly the road ahead of us, and we are convinced that the plan formulated by Comrade Stalin - the plan to raise the level of Soviet industry threefold in the shortest historical period - will undoubtedly be completed. (Prolonged applause)

The situation in the countries of the capitalist camp is different.

Everyone knows that due to the success of the Soviet plan, the concept of economic planning has become a universal idea for all nations. The leaders of the United States want to take advantage of this point to promote the so-called "Marshall Plan." But what is the real value of the "Marshall Plan"? We can see from the fact that within a few years of the implementation of this "Aid to Europe Plan", the economic crisis has already begun to develop in European countries and the United States. The astonishing number of unemployed and underemployed workers who work less than a week also proves this point. In capitalist countries, this number is almost 45 million. Yes, the Marshall Plan did facilitate the seizure of the rule of many industrial and national financial sectors in European countries by American monopoly capitalists, but this did not stabilize the situation of American industry. On the other hand, the influx of unsold goods from the United States into Europe has played a role. The national industries of "Marshallized" countries find themselves in a bad situation. The national industries of these countries are shrinking, and production is declining. This decline has created a new army of unemployed people who are constantly taking to the streets without food.

Under such circumstances, it is understandable that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries advocate peaceful competition between the socialist and capitalist systems, while the gloomy and lack of confidence spirit and war-mongering adventures dominate in the imperialist camp. Every new year of development in peace strengthens the position of countries like the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, but this cannot be said for capitalism.

We have no reason to hide the fact that, in order to implement its long-term plan, the Soviet Union is concerned with consolidating peace and broad peaceful cooperation with other countries. Consolidating peace, world peace - this is the banner under which the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are marching forward. (Long applause)

**Imperialist Fools Are Indulging in Crazy Aggression Plans, Arousing the Anger of the People of All Countries**

The ruling groups in the imperialist camp are pursuing a different policy.

The imperialists are using the policy of preparing for a new world war to counter the world's policy of consolidating peace. It was they - the aggressive countries - who rejected the Soviet government's proposal in the UN General Assembly to conclude a treaty to strengthen peace. It was they who forced West Germany to accept their occupation regulations in order to keep German territory under their military occupation for as long as possible, and to prevent Germany from getting a peace treaty. It was also they who prevented Japan from getting a peace treaty, illegally trying to keep Japanese territory under their military occupation for as long as possible, but they do not understand that doing so discredits the occupying country.

It was the ruling groups in the United States who spent 6 billion US dollars to incite civil war in China. It is still American planes that are bombing the peaceful residents of Shanghai and other cities in China, and these planes are sent by Chiang Kai-shek, the puppet of the imperialists. It is those aggressive countries that pursue discriminatory foreign trade policies against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and hinder the development of the entire international trade. It is their newspapers that endlessly shout all day long that they need to pursue a so-called "cold war" policy against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, demand a significant increase in military budgets, constantly build new military bases, and continue to implement policies that forever threaten the peace-loving countries in the democratic camp. The capitalists of the British and American groups use this to obtain more war orders and tens of billions of new profits.

All kinds of blackmailers in this camp threatened us with atomic bombs yesterday. Today, they are threatening us with "hydrogen bombs" that do not yet exist. They should not brag so much, and they should always remember that when they frightened people by saying that they exclusively owned atomic bombs, everyone knew that the Soviet people were not idle, and they explored the secrets of producing atomic energy and atomic weapons. (Long applause) Only a fool like a crazy minister would indulge in such a crazy plan, namely: to intimidate the Soviet Union and propagate various aggression plans to confuse their people. They do not understand that, under the current circumstances, if the imperialists refuse peaceful competition and launch a new war, they will inevitably arouse the just and resolute anger of the people of all countries, and this anger will eliminate imperialism and aggressors from the world forever. (Thunderous applause)

We wholeheartedly support the Lenin-Stalinist principle of peaceful coexistence of the two systems and their peaceful economic competition. But we deeply know the axiom that as long as imperialism exists, the crisis of new aggression exists. The existence of imperialism and its aggression plans inevitably leads to various wars. That is why the advocates of consolidating world peace must not be passive, must not become pacifists who are full of empty words, must carry out a resolute and increasingly effective daily struggle for peace, mobilize the masses of the people to participate in the struggle, and dare to take various appropriate measures when the imperialists attempt to launch new aggression.

**Hundreds of Millions of People Unite to Fight for Peace to Prevent the Launching of New Wars of Aggression**

We believe that the mass movement of peace supporters that has been launched in all countries is an important fortress for maintaining world peace, because this movement is a true manifestation of the best aspirations and hopes of all nations. We now have something that did not exist before World War II. Before World War II, the anti-aggressors and supporters of peaceful relations among countries also had an advantage among the masses of the people. But at that time, the supporters of peace were not united and were not organized into a single powerful camp. The situation is different now. Now we have a front of peace supporters organized on an international scale, a front with the participation of the masses of the people.

The countries in the same camp as the Soviet Union include such countries as the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries. Their population is 800 million, accounting for more than one-third of the world's population. Millions of people in other countries also support the cause of consolidating peace and oppose imperialist aggression.

The communists of France, Italy, Australia and other countries stand firm on the front line to defend the vital interests of the people and openly declare that the people of these countries will never fight against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and are unwilling to be the tools of imperialist aggression. These courageous and powerful declarations truly reflect the increased consciousness of the masses of the people, and have great international significance; mobilizing more and more millions of people to fight for peace, actively striving for the interests of all peace-loving countries, and opposing war-mongers and new aggression.

If the peace supporters in all countries carry out a persistent struggle for the consolidation of world peace, expose all war-mongers, expand and consolidate their ranks, then the international movement of peace supporters will accomplish its historical mission - preventing the launching of new wars of aggression, mobilizing powerful forces of the people sufficient to restrain any aggressor to oppose imperialist aggression forces. (Prolonged applause)

In short, this also leads to certain conclusions about our future tasks.

Comrades! Everyone understands why the current Supreme Soviet election is being held again under the battle banner of the Stalinist alliance of party members and non-party members. This alliance unites workers, peasants and intellectuals - all Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party.

This alliance is the foundation of our victory and the guarantee of further achievements of the Soviet state. (Prolonged applause)

Long live the victorious alliance of party members and non-party members! (Stormy applause)

Long live the powerful Soviet people and their great Bolshevik Party, the party of Lenin and Stalin! (Cheers)

Long live our great and wise leader, our Comrade Stalin! (Long and thunderous cheers. All stood up, and the voices of cheers for Comrade Stalin resounded throughout the hall.)

　　莫斯科莫洛托夫选区选民大会上
    莫洛托夫发表演说
    苏联关心于巩固的和平以及与其他国家广泛的和平合作
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：莫洛托夫十日在莫斯科莫洛托夫选区的选民大会上发表演说如下：
    同志们！我衷心感谢你们对我的信任，提名我做你们的苏联最高苏维埃候选人。
    我首先把你们所给我的荣誉当作是你们信任我们伟大的共产党、信任那些对党无限忠诚的共产党人的表现。（掌声）
    为了我国的繁荣，为了苏联人民的幸福，我现在和以往一样地预备效忠并竭尽全力来执行伟大的列宁与斯大林党的意志，把我的全部精力贡献给国家。（长时间的掌声）
    同志们！现在的选举运动使我们有机会来回顾一下苏联在第二次世界大战结束后的几年当中已经有了些什么成就。
  苏联国民经济一切主要部门都在胜利进展
    四年以前，斯大林同志在说到第一个战后五年计划时，曾着重指出两个基本任务。首先他指出了复兴被破坏的地区、把工业与农业恢复至战前水平，然后相当提高超过这个水平的任务。他还强调指出另一个重要任务：提高苏联劳动人民的生活水平。他还概括地说明了这一坚定不移的政策，即取消配给制、最大限度地扩大消费品生产，有步骤地减低各种商品的价格。这两个任务就是第一个战后五年计划的基础。
    你们现在已经看到了这两个任务的执行情况。
    复兴那些被侵略者所蹂躏的苏联地区对我们具有巨大的重要性。只说出这点就够了：在那些被敌人占领的地区，其工业品产量一向是占战前我国全部工业产量的三分之一，而这些地区的播种面积差不多占我国播种面积的一半。在这些地区所进行的复兴工作已经产生了值得注意的成绩。
    关于整个国民经济，在所有它的基本部门中，我们不但已经达到并且还超过了战前水平。
    在农业方面，去年已经超过了其总产量的战前水平。就在去年，谷类、棉花、亚麻、葵花子和马铃薯的收获量以及集体农场公有牲畜如牛、绵羊和猪的头数，就已超过战前最好的年头。食粮问题现在已经解决了。我们现在有充足的食粮供应，其中还包括必要的储藏。去年所通过的发展牲畜饲养三年计划之完成将会使肉、黄油、鸡蛋、牛奶及其他乳品与肉制品增加到这种程度，即使我们有可能确保一九五一年对人民的供应量至少要较一九四八年增加百分之五十。
    政府方面正采取重要的步骤来给农业以更多的帮助。一九四九年，农业获得了为战前一九四○年三倍至四倍的拖拉机、摩托车和农业机器。
    然而，主要的事情是：我们所有的二十五万四千个集体农场已经更加壮大了，并且现在已经有了许多在机械化和劳动生产率方面水平都很高的模范集体农场。男女集体农民当中，正涌现出数以千计的先进农民，他们荣获了奖章和社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
    远在一九四八年，我们的工业就已达到而且超过了战前水平。一九四九年已超过战前水平百分之四十一，这就和五年计划规定其最后一年要超过战前水平百分之四十八的数字相近。去年第四季，我们的工业超过了五年计划第五年即今年所规定的水平。俄罗斯（按指俄罗斯联邦共和国）的全部工业生产在革命前的一九一三年共值一百六十亿卢布；但在过去两年，工业生产所值每年增加三百二十亿至三百四十亿卢布，这就等于革命前全部工业总产量的两倍。
    战后头四年中，已建立、恢复并开工生产的国营工业企业，有五千二百个，规模小的尚不算在内。这些企业现在雇用有一百五十万工人、工程师、技师和职员。例如去年工业中基本建设的规模就几乎等于战前最好年份的两倍。建设一年年增加。这意味着苏联工业进一步的、更有力的发展已有了保证。
    最重要的是：进一步促进工业的发展并改进工业产品质量的群众运动，现在已有大部分的工人、领班、技师和工程师参加进去了，这一个群众运动在工业和运输中正越来越扩展，而且也在农业中扩展着。
    这么一来，我国国民经济的一切主要部门都在胜利进展，正在完成并超过斯大林同志所拟定的计划和战后第一个五年计划的规定。（热烈掌声）
  劳动人民的福利正不断改进
    斯大林同志在上次选举运动中所提出的第二个任务之执行也获得不少的成就。
    在提高城乡劳动人民生活水平方面，我们在过去四年中已经获得了显著的成就。减低消费品价格的政策和取消配给制度同时开始。一九四七年和一九四九年所实行的减低物价使人民节省了一千五百七十亿卢布。去年，人民对最主要物品的消费量已经超过了战前水平。
    由于劳动生产率提高和生产成本减低的结果，党与政府乃于三月一日发布决议，实行了人民需要最大的大批物品的第三次减价。面包、肉类与黄油的价格减低了百分之二十五至三十；织物和鞋子约减低了百分之十五至二十；而某些物品的价格竟减少了百分之四十至五十。此次减低物价将使人民全年至少获益一千一百亿卢布。这是由于一方面在我国减低物价，一方面仍维持现有的薪资水平、维持年金和奖学金，并且不改变政府收购农产品价格的结果所致。
    从公布的数字中，现在可以知道：一九四九年产业工人和职员的收入比一九四○年增加百分之二十。同一时期内，农民的收入增加百分之三十以上。一九四九年度苏联全部国民收入比一九四○年增加百分之三十六。由于三月一日实行的消费品价格的再次减低，产业工人和职员的实际工资将再度大大地增加，农民购买工业制成品的费用，将再度大大地减少。随着物价减低，卢布的购买力及其与美元、英镑和其他外币的兑换率将大为增加。这正是在美国及其他资本主义国家的工人的收入因物价上涨而逐年下降的时候。这是在去年美国农民的收入下降了百分之十七、和资本主义国家的货币节节贬值的时候。由此，就可以理解为什么美国和欧洲的资产阶级报纸，对于我们报上刊载的有关实现一九四九年度苏联国民经济计划所获辉煌成果的消息要保持缄默；也可以理解为什么那种报纸会如此狼狈到在关于我国新减价的报道中使用无聊的诡计，千方百计地歪曲这一对劳动人民如此重要的措施的真实意义。资产阶级的报纸与伪社会主义者走狗的报纸显然害怕谈到确凿表明苏联巨大进展的事实。（掌声）
    我国的国民经济，首先是国民经济的原动力——社会主义工业，正循着社会主义经济的稳步发展的规律，年复一年地增长着。这一规律已经在苏维埃国家里确立起来。同时，劳动人民的福利也在不断地改善。这是苏维埃国家和一切属于资本主义阵营的国家的根本区别所在。劳动人民的生活水平不断提高也是苏维埃社会主义国家的经济发展的基本规律之一。
    这意味着我们可以满足于我们的成就吗？不，党和斯大林同志不是这样教导我们的。党要求我们每一个人对自己的工作作一个有系统和大胆的批评性的检查。斯大林同志教导我们：没有自我批评就没有进步，我们需要自我批评犹之乎我们需要空气。斯大林同志在写给高尔基的一封有名的信中写道：“我们不能一天没有自我批评。马克西姆维奇·阿历克赛，这是不行的。没有自我批评将不可避免地引起停滞、机器的腐坏、官僚主义的增长，并且会破坏工人阶级的创造性和主动性。”
    这段话是在十二年前写的。但却完全适用于今天。
    只有当我们以布尔什维克的作风，勇敢地揭露着我们工作中的缺点与错误；只有当我们依靠国家的强大的发展，对于我们自己更加严肃的时候；只有当我们表现善于团结苏维埃人民的进步力量与整个苏维埃人民，并且引导他们以及我们全体人民来努力执行党按照国内与国际形势的要求而提出的时刻不同的任务的时候，我们才是在真正地前进。这决定了我们的一切党与非党的组织、苏维埃、工会与共产主义青年团的主要任务。
    我们现在看到：在战后开始的国家的经济复兴，现在已基本上完成，我们的经济水平已超过战前。我们现在有更大机会去解决建造住宅之类的重要问题。在草拟中的扩大苏维埃首都——莫斯科的建设的计划里，最大的注意力放在新的住宅、学校与医院的建筑。（全体鼓掌）
    我们已有了能够满足人民日益增加的物品需要的强大工业。同时，我们的工业制造出各式各样的机器，优良精确的仪器和各种的技术珍品。我们已达到这样的状况：在广泛的国家计划的基础上，在国民经济的一切部门中，特别是在煤矿、装卸车货与船货、建筑、伐木业等等部门中，我们正有组织地采用了新的装备。如果我们组织这件事情得当，并且作更大努力去消灭现有的缺点，那么，我们将大大地减轻我们的工人们的劳动，将在许多现在落后的工业部门中，大大提高劳动生产率，并将创造出进一步减低生产成本和改进产品质量的必要的先决条件。
    今天，在各个劳动部门中居于决定性地位和担任主要职责的都是有丰富的实际经验和充分训练的共产党人和其他苏维埃人民。我们的经济人员也日渐增多起来了。这是由于在战前清除了托洛斯基分子、布哈林分子及帝国主义国家各种各样的间谍机关派到我们的企业与机关来的其他破坏分子的结果——我们切莫忘记这个。今天，有专科学校和专门学校文凭而从事于国民经济工作的专家，其总数约较战前一九四○年增加百分之七十。每年，工业、运输业和农业的技术专家的队伍都得到年年增多的新生力军。因此，我们现在有了在战前我们没有的那种改进经济与技术领导方法的机会。
    斯大林同志在上次选举运动中特别强调进一步发展科学研究的必要性。他当时规定我国科学家的任务是：“不仅要赶上并且还要在最近的将来超过国外科学的成就。”事实说明：我们在这方面已获得胜利的进展。只要指出斯大林奖金获奖者的人数日益增多这一事实就够了。
  苏联击败德日法西斯，使国际形势发生了重大的变化
    现在，每一个人都可以看到德国及其他法西斯分子是多么短视，他们在进攻苏联时竟指望要击溃苏联人民和消灭苏维埃国家。他们的头脑没有及时了解到没有任何一种法西斯分子能够做到这一点，也没有及时了解法西斯分子对苏联的进攻其结局只有自身毁灭。苏联人民首当第二次世界大战之冲，但是尽管他们承受了一切灾难与损失，他们却从战争中变得比以前更强大、更有力、而且更相信他们的力量了。（掌声）
    甚至在第二次世界大战期间曾为我们盟国的那些国家里，也有不少的政客们，把他们的计划建筑在这样的设想上，即由于敌人占领及后来我国人民所遭受到的艰难处境，苏维埃国家将会元气大伤，这样帝国主义者就将有可能把他们的意志强加于苏联的头上。这些人也不免眼光太短小了。他们的头脑了解不到像苏联这样一个强大的社会主义国家的实力所在，他们了解不到苏联的力量是无穷无尽的泉源是什么。他们不了解这一桩事实的伟大意义，即苏联是建基于那些至今还未被人了解但实际上是能够创造奇迹的那些新的社会因素之上，诸如：社会主义社会不可摧毁的精神上与政治上的团结，苏维埃国家各族人民的兄弟般友谊，和那在共产党领导下苏维埃人民的逐步增长的苏维埃爱国主义。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    各式各样的反动分子是了解不到苏联究竟是什么样的国家的，这点我们用不着惊奇，因为他们是向后看而不是向前看，因为他们就好像某种动物一样抬不起他们的头来。（大笑，掌声）
    只有当人们记起苏联是由最伟大的革命家列宁缔造，而且正由光辉的领袖、我们的斯大林领导的时候，他们才会正确地了解我们——我国人民，才会适如其分地估量苏联的历史地位，认为它是我们这一时代的具有决定性的进步力量。（讲演为暴风雨般的经久不绝的掌声所打断，全场起立）
    对德国法西斯及日本帝国主义的胜利，和苏联在击败这些侵略势力上所起的决定性作用，使国际形势发生了重大的变化。
    想一想在苏联西方所发生的变化吧。在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚，人民民主国家已经建立起来了，而且获得了稳固的基础。它们的兴起是由于法西斯在欧洲的失败，是由于这些国家的人民在其民族与社会解放当中得到了苏军的援助。（鼓掌）
    这些国家的人民在赢得了自由之后，便推翻了资本家与地主剥削阶级，并从主要职位上把它们赶出去，从而在以共产党和工人党领导下的工人阶级为首的工农联盟之基础上建立了人民民主政权。
    第二次世界大战前，英、法、美三国的走狗，或德、意法西斯国家的走狗，常常在这些国家的政府中扮演显要的角色，有时两者同时扮演要角。但今天，情况已完全不同了。当然，消灭帝国主义在小国的走卒并不是这样轻而易举的。匈牙利的拉伊克审讯、保加利亚的科斯托夫审讯以及其他许多事实，均显示出帝国主义者甚至还遣送他们的走卒——间谍到共产党的领导机构中来，更不用谈资产阶级的政党了。而当人民民主国家终于完成了这种必要而正当的任务，即摧毁了这些成为各种各样颠覆分子、破坏分子和恐怖分子之避难所的间谍巢穴之后，美欧两洲的统治集团便企图干涉这些国家的内政。他们以“保障人权”为借口，提出各种各样的威胁与指责，并采取报复行动，甚至断绝外交关系，像最近对保加利亚所做的那样。但是，不难了解这样的侵略性行动是无用的。
    在战后四年中，人民民主国家已经明确地确定了它们发展的进一步趋势。它们已壮大起来，成为实现无产阶级专政之机能的国家。它们已走上社会主义的道路，最生动地显示出：欧洲各国人民除了坚决过渡到社会主义之外，是没有其他走向自由与生活水平提高的道路的。友谊与互助的纽带把苏联与人民民主国家的人民密切地联系起来。
    南斯拉夫铁托集团卑鄙叛卖行为的败露，是具有重大的建设性的意义的。今天，这一犯罪伙帮在本国已不再能躲藏在共产主义的假面具后面了，在其他国家已不再能败坏真诚民主分子与社会主义者的队伍了。南斯拉夫人民自然将从已经发展的情况中得出他们自己的结论。
    现在谈德国。我们尚未能与我们第二次世界大战的盟国在这一问题上找出共同的语言。美、英、法三国的片面行动已导致德意志国家的分裂，其后是西德的肢解，萨尔地区的分出与工业区鲁尔的分出。这一政策只能以可耻的失败告终。
    以柏林为首都的德意志民主共和国的成立，不仅标志着德国历史上而且标志着欧洲历史上的新的一页。斯大林同志非常令人信服地谈到了这一点。他指出：“爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血并使世界帝国主义者奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。”德国人民认识德意志民主共和国成立的真正历史意义愈早，他们赢得他们的全国统一也就愈早，欧洲巩固的和平也就得到愈加坚实的保证。    （掌声）
  中苏兄弟盟约的伟大力量在人类历史上是无可匹敌的
    现在往东方看，把目前的情况和数年以前比较一下。
    在第二次世界大战以前，亚洲只有一个民主国家——蒙古人民共和国。而现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经成立，并正在寻求全国的完全统一，并且无疑地可以达到全国的完全统一。越南人民共和国成立的重大意义，也是显而易见的。
    最近人们才看出来，盟国战胜德国法西斯主义及日本帝国主义的最重要的结果，就是中国民族解放运动的胜利。（经久不息的掌声）中国共产党领导下的中国人民革命运动，赢得伟大的胜利，费了二十余年的时间。到今日，在他们杰出的领袖毛泽东的领导下，中国人民已经建立了他们自己的人民共和国。（经久不息的掌声）
    继我国十月革命之后，中国民族解放运动的胜利是对于世界帝国主义的整个体系，以及目前的一切帝国主义侵略计划的又一次最有力的打击。苏联与中华人民共和国之间已建立了紧密的友好关系，这是可以了解的。苏联与中华人民共和国之间于二月间订立的兄弟同盟条约，使苏中两国的友谊，变成了巩固普遍和平的强大的力量，这种力量无可匹敌，并且在人类历史上也从无能与之匹敌的力量的。（讲演为暴风雨般的掌声打断）
    此外还必须说明，自从二次世界大战以后，在资本主义国家内，也发生了重大的变化。在若干资本主义国家里，共产党与工人党，如果不是已经在人民政治发展上，占有了决定性的地位，那就是在实现这个目的时，进行了胜利的工作，依照革命的马克思列宁主义的原则，改组了他们的组织。
    十月革命以后，许多年间，苏联是仅有的社会主义国家，处在资本主义国家敌视的包围中。帝国主义者用种种计策企图扼杀苏联。英国议会中的死硬、反动而猖狂的邱吉尔，去年在英国议会中演说时，曾厉声责骂历史，因为历史没有在萌芽之际“挫亡布尔什维克”。苏联不仅在它无数次的考验中昂然屹立，而且还在这样的斗争中增强了力量。
    在二次世界大战中，苏联使它最狂暴的敌人，遭受了毁灭性的失败。
    苏联在战争获胜之后，在取得机会给予别国的解放战争以有效的援助之后，终于从国际上孤立无援的地位脱离了出来。目前苏联不仅脱离了国际孤立的地位，并且还是团结一切人民民主国家的强有力的国际民主阵营的核心。在资本主义国家里，我们有千百万得力的朋友，他们正逐渐地向广大的民主反帝国主义运动的队伍靠拢。
    在这样的新情况下，特别是在苏联人民与中国人民之间——在世界上两个最大的国家之间——的坚实的反帝国主义同盟结成之后，和平民主及社会主义阵营，已变成了最不可轻侮的力量。（经久不息的掌声）这一个和平与自由的阵营，正在可靠的路上，经过历史考验过的路上向前迈进；而在这一点上的保证便是：在它的团结的旗帜上，写着伟大的名字——斯大林。（长时间的暴风雨般的欢呼）
  帝国主义阵营根基已经动摇  苏联工业正进一步有力上升
    团结了苏联及人民民主国家的民主阵营是受到以美国统治集团为首的帝国主义国家阵营的反对的。
    虽然帝国主义的地位，在二次世界大战以后，证明根基已经动摇，腐朽的濒死的资本主义政权，注定了要灭亡。但帝国主义是舍不得断气，是不会甘心情愿退出历史的。正相反，它是一次又一次地在设法探起头来，它是在用严酷的步骤对付进步组织与民主运动，它是在努力想从其他国家反动政府的盟友里匆匆拚凑各种集团，并且正在肆无忌惮的从事新的更为罪恶的侵略行动的准备工作，企图实现他征服世界的梦想。密切注意帝国主义的阵营，这是我们经常的任务，也是重要的责任。马克思主义教导我们说，国家的命运首先是决定于国家的经济发展。这就是为什么我们必须特别注意资本主义国家有关经济状况的事实。
    例如拿有关美国——目前主要的资本主义强国的事实来说，美国资本家很便宜地利用了第二次世界大战。他们较之平时更加扩张了工业，并且把荷包装满。他们也大肆利用了某些国家的战后困难，特别是利用了被征服的德、意、日的经济衰落去倾销他们的货物，并把更多的黄金装进荷包去。但在战争结束以后，美帝国主义工业在战争时期（这种战争对欧亚各国曾有那样大的摧毁）人为地制造的繁荣很快就完结了。从已经发表的材料中，大家都知道美国工业在过去数年中已降到战争时期的水平以下。大家也知道在一九四九年十月工业生产特别降低，工业水平已较一九四八年十月的数字降低百分之二十二。
    而苏联工业在一九四九年的水平却已经上升了百分之二十。美国降低了百分之二十二，表明了已在美国开始的经济危机，同时也表明了正在一切资本主义国家发展着的经济危机。苏联增加了百分之二十，说明了苏联工业进一步的有力上升。（讲演被掌声打断）
    关于两个阵营中各个国家的经济发展前途，我们究竟能作如何的推测呢？这只有苏联以及正在遵循社会主义道路，并依靠苏联支持的人民民主国家，才能够对这问题予以明晰的解答。在上次的选举运动中，斯大林同志曾规定了我国经济发展的主要路线。他阐明了在三个五年计划时间或者稍为多些的时间内的经济计划的原则，规定了“提高我国工业水平的主要任务，譬如说提高到战前水平的三倍”。
    我们战后的第一个五年计划现正接近结束。我们看到：我们的国家是在胜利地完成并超计划完成这第一个战后五年计划的工作。
  苏联第二个战后斯大林主义的五年计划正在草拟
    今年，我们正在草拟自一九五一年开始的第二个战后五年计划。自然，这第二个和我们以后的一些战后五年计划也将是斯大林主义的五年计划，这就说明了它的本质。（讲演被鼓掌声淹没）
    每一个人都知道：我们的经济计划的实现，使我们国家的经济提到越来越高的水平，同时不断地改善了苏维埃人民的福利。我们很明白我们前面的路途，我们确信：斯大林同志拟订的计划——在最短的历史时期内提高苏维埃工业水平三倍的计划——毫无疑问将会完成。（经久不息的掌声）
    资本主义阵营的国家里情形却不相同。
    大家知道，由于苏联计划的成功，经济计划的观点已成为一切民族的普遍思想。美国领袖们想利用这一点，大事宣扬所谓“马歇尔计划”。但是，“马歇尔计划”真正有什么价值呢？我们可以从就在这个“援欧计划”实行的几年内，经济危机已经开始在欧洲国家和美国发展这一点看出来。失业和工作不足一周的半失业者之令人惊讶的数字也证明了这一点。在资本主义国家内，这个数字几乎达到四千五百万人。是的，马歇尔计划确是便利了美国垄断资本家夺取欧洲国家许多工业与国家财政部门的统治，但这并没有使美国工业的情况稳定下来。另一方面，美国销不出去的货物涌入欧洲却起了作用。“马歇尔化”国家的民族工业发现其本身处境恶劣。这些国家的民族工业正在缩减，生产正在发生衰降。这种衰降造成了不断地走上街头的没有饭吃的新的失业大军。
    在这种情况下，这是可以理解的：苏联和人民民主国家主张社会主义与资本主义两种制度间的和平竞赛，而在帝国主义阵营中阴暗的没有信心的精神和好战的冒险，却占支配地位。在和平情况下发展的每一个新年，都加强了像苏联与人民民主国家这种国家的地位，而对于资本主义却是不能这样说的。
    我们没有理由隐藏这一事实，即为了执行它的长远计划，苏联关心于巩固的和平以及与其它国家的广泛的和平合作。巩固的和平、全世界的和平——这就是苏联和人民民主国家在其下面向前挺进的旗帜。（长时间鼓掌）
  帝国主义蠢材们正沉溺于疯狂的侵略计划，激起了各国人民的愤怒
    帝国主义阵营中的统治集团则奉行不同的方针。
    帝国主义者们用准备新世界战争的政策来对抗全世界巩固和平的政策。在联合国大会中拒绝苏联政府所提缔结加强和平的公约一项建议的正是它们——侵略国家。正是他们迫使西德接受它们的占领法规以便使德领土尽量久地处于他们军事占领之下，并使德国得不到和约。也正是他们不让日本得到和约，非法地试图使日本领土尽量久地留在它们的军事占领之下，却不懂得这样作是使占领国威信扫地。
    花费六十亿美元来煽起中国内战的，正是美国的统治集团。直到今天还在向上海及中国其它城市的和平居民投弹的是美国的飞机，而这些飞机是由帝国主义者的傀儡蒋介石派去的。正是那些侵略国家奉行针对苏联和人民民主国家的歧视性对外贸易政策，而阻碍整个国际贸易的发展。正是他们的报纸整天无休无止地喊叫需要奉行反对苏联和人民民主国家的所谓“冷战”政策，要求大大增加军事预算，不断地建设新军事基地，继续执行永远威胁民主阵营中爱好和平国家的政策。英美集团各国的资本家们却利用这个来取得更多的战争订货和亿万元新的利润。
    这个阵营中的各种各样的讹诈者们昨天用原子弹来威胁我们。今天，他们又用还没有存在的“氢弹”来威胁我们。他们不要吹得这样厉害，他们倒不如永远记住这一点：当他们吓诈人们说他们独家拥有原子弹时，大家知道，苏联人民并不是游手好闲的，他们试探了生产原子能和原子武器的秘密。（长时间的鼓掌）只有像某一个发了疯的部长那样的蠢材，才会沉溺于这样疯狂的计划，即：恫吓苏联并宣传各种各样的侵略计划来迷惑他们的人民。他们不了解，在目前的情况下，帝国主义者们若拒绝和平竞赛并发动新战争，他们将不可免地激起各国人民的正当的和坚决的愤怒，这种愤怒将把帝国主义和侵略者从世界上永远消灭掉。（掌声雷动）
    我们衷心地支持两个制度和平共存及它们的和平经济竞赛的列宁——斯大林主义的原则。但我们深知这一公理，即帝国主义存在一天，新侵略的危机就存在一天，帝国主义及其侵略计划的存在，不可避免地引起各种战争。这就是为什么巩固的世界和平的拥护者必须是不被动的，必须不变成满口空话的绥靖主义者，必须为争取和平进行坚决的愈来愈有效的日常斗争，发动人民群众参加斗争，并且在帝国主义者企图发动新侵略时，敢于采取各种适当的措施。
  亿万人民团结起来争取和平定能防止新侵略战争的发动
    我们认为一切国家内已经展开的和平拥护者的群众运动，乃是维持全世界和平的重要堡垒，因为这个运动是一切民族的最好的抱负与希望的真正表现。我们现在有了在第二次世界大战前所不存在的东西。在第二次世界大战以前，反侵略者和各国和平关系的拥护者，也在人民群众中占有优势。但那时，和平的拥护者并没有团结起来，并没有组织在一个单一的强大的阵营中。现在情况已经不同。现在我们有了在国际规模上组织起来的和平拥护者的阵线，有人民群众参加的阵线。
    与苏联同在一个阵营中的国家有这样的国家，如中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家。它们的人口有八万万，占全世界人口三分之一以上。其他国家千百万的人民也支持巩固的和平的事业和反对帝国主义的侵略。
    法国、意大利、澳大利亚以及其他国家的共产党人坚守前线保卫人民切身利益，并公开地宣布：这些国家的人民决不与苏联和人民民主国家作战，不愿做帝国主义的侵略工具。这些勇敢的有力的宣言，真正地表现了人民大众觉悟的增高，具有巨大的国际意义；动员了愈来愈多的千百万人民为和平而战，为了一切爱好和平的国家的利益积极地努力，反对战争挑拨者，反对新的侵略。
    如果一切国家中的和平拥护者都为世界巩固的和平进行持久的斗争，揭露一切战争挑拨者，扩大和巩固他们的队伍，那末，和平拥护者的国际运动就会完成它的历史使命——防止新侵略战争的发动，动员强大的足以箝制任何侵略者的人民力量来反对帝国主义的侵略力量。（经久不息的掌声）
    总之，由此也可以得出某些有关我们将来的任务的结论。
    同志们！每一个人都了解为什么目前的最高苏维埃选举又在斯大林主义的党与非党联盟的战斗旗帜下举行。这一联盟把工人、农民和知识分子——全体苏联人民团结在共产党的领导之下。
    这个联盟是我们胜利的基础和苏维埃国家的进一步成就的保证。（经久不息的掌声）
    胜利的党与非党联盟万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    强大的苏联人民和他们的伟大的布尔什维克党，列宁与斯大林的党万岁！（欢呼）
    我们的伟大而英明的领袖，我们的斯大林同志万岁！（长久的雷动的欢呼。全体起立，欢呼斯大林同志的声音响彻全厅。）
