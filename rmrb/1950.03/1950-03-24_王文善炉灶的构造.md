The construction of the coal-saving stove made by Wang Wenshan, a cook in a certain division, is as follows. After inquiries from the Tsinghua University dining hall, the "North China Liberation Army Daily" of the Political Department of the North China Military Region sent the following drawing:

[Instructions] Replace the grate bars at the bottom of the stove with a round iron plate, and punch holes about the size of soybeans on it to prevent coal slag from falling. Align the bottom of the stove with the bottom of the pot, separated by one *sheng* (approximately 10 cm), so that the flame directly heats the bottom of the pot. Leave a square opening of five or six inches at the front stove door. The flue should be five inches wide and two and a half inches high to prevent the fire from running backwards. The stove chamber is pot-shaped to avoid wasting the heat of the fire. The air duct between the bottom of the stove and the bellows slopes upward towards the bottom of the stove, with the larger opening facing the bellows and the smaller opening facing the bottom of the stove.

　　王文善炉灶的构造
    某师炊事员王文善，节省烧煤所用炉灶的构造，经清华大学膳团询问后，华北军区政治部《华北解放军报》寄来图样如下：
    【说明】把炉底下的炉条换成圆形铁板，上面凿成黄豆粒大小的窟窿，防止炭渣漏掉。炉底与锅底对正，相隔十生的，使火焰直烧锅底。前灶门留五六寸大的方口。走烟道宽五寸，高二寸五，防止火向后跑。灶膛是锅形的，不浪费火的热力。炉底与风箱之间的走风筒，向炉底上斜，大口向风箱，小口向炉底。（附图片）
