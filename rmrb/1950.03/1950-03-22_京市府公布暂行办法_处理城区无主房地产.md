　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has recently announced the "Provisional Measures of the Beijing Municipal People's Government for Handling Ownerless Real Estate in Urban Areas" in order to determine property rights, complete the land registration of Beijing, and promote the rational use of real estate. The measures stipulate that real estate shall be deemed ownerless under any of the following circumstances: (1) Failure to register before the registration deadline (the end of January 1950); (2) Having applied for registration but failing to complete the procedures within the prescribed time limit after being notified due to insufficient documentation. For such ownerless real estate, the Land Administration Bureau shall announce the location of the real estate in batches in the People's Daily. If the owner of the real estate submits sufficient supporting documents within three months from the day after the announcement, and the Land Administration Bureau verifies the documents, the registration shall be allowed, and a penalty shall be imposed in accordance with the overdue registration clauses. If no one registers or the registration documents are insufficient after the deadline, the Land Administration Bureau shall transfer the property to the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau for trusteeship. If an application has been made to the Land Administration Bureau for a postponement of registration, and one of the following conditions is met, the trusteeship of the real estate may be temporarily suspended after verification: (1) Existing property rights disputes are involved in litigation and have not been resolved, and court litigation documents or deposit receipts are held; (2) The real estate was occupied by the enemy or puppet regime and has not yet been processed and determined by the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau, and the deposit receipts of the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau or the Puppet Regime Processing Bureau are held.
    The trusteeship period is limited to three years, and it will be listed as public property after the expiration of the period. During the trusteeship period, the original real estate owner may submit supporting documents to apply for return. After the Land Administration Bureau and the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau jointly verify the documents, the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau shall return the property. For real estate approved for return, the income, taxes, management, and repair expenses incurred during the trusteeship period shall be settled by the owner with the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau; however, if the repair expenses are too high and exceed the rental income, the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau may handle the matter at its discretion. If the ownerless real estate has been rented or used by someone before trusteeship, they may apply to the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau for renewal or rental with priority, and they shall continue to have the right of first refusal after the property is returned to the original owner. No one may transfer, pawn, mortgage, or set other burdens on ownerless real estate. The current users of such real estate have the responsibility to protect it. If there is any damage or loss, they shall be responsible for compensation and shall be severely punished in accordance with the law. In special circumstances not covered by these measures or to which these measures do not apply, the Land Administration Bureau or the Public and Confiscated Property Administration Bureau may report to the Municipal Government for approval based on the actual situation.
