　　Literary and Art Study Group Holds Closing Celebration
    [Beijing News] The Literary and Art Study Group, jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Winter Vacation Youth Work Committee, the Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education's Literary and Art Department, the People's Art Theatre, and the Primary and Secondary School Music Teachers' Research Association, held its closing celebration on February 27th in the auditorium of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Over six hundred music teachers and students who participated in the study, as well as guests, attended.
    During the two weeks around the Spring Festival, the Literary and Art Study Group held a total of fourteen lectures on the guidelines and tasks of literary and art work, as well as literary and art theory. The drama, music, and dance groups of the professional study class conducted over twenty professional studies respectively and held research discussions in combination with the actual situation of the schools. At the closing celebration, Chairman Li Bokang described the study situation and pointed out that the learning in this stage was fruitful and would promote and enrich the school's cultural and recreational activities in the future. He hoped that everyone would grasp the basic guideline of "auxiliary learning" for school cultural and recreational activities and, while avoiding tendencies toward departmentalism and not exaggerating the role of cultural and recreational activities too much, strengthen regular cultural and recreational activities to enliven school life. Representatives of the students in each group stated in their speeches that they would definitely work hard after returning to school. Finally, teachers and students participating in the study performed recreational programs to add to the festivities. (Youth)
