　　Shijiazhuang Municipal Health Bureau and Labor Bureau Hold Factory Doctor Conference to Strengthen Workers' Health Work
    [Our Report] According to the Shijiazhuang Daily on the 20th: The Shijiazhuang Municipal Health Bureau and Labor Bureau jointly held a conference of factory doctors from state-owned, public-owned, and private factories on the 10th. The city's Federation of Trade Unions also sent representatives to participate. At the meeting, the doctors from each factory reported the recent number of illnesses among the workers in their respective factories and the recent diagnosis and treatment situation. According to the reports: the Da Xing Yarn Factory has a total of 1,921 employees and 3,224 family members, with an average of 150 to 160 outpatient visits per day; the number of people taking sick leave was 384 in January and February (excluding a portion transferred to the Municipal Hospital). Deaths were most frequently due to pulmonary tuberculosis, with seven deaths in seven months. This is mainly because the air in the factory is too bad, cotton fibers fly around, and most workers do not wear masks, causing them to inhale the cotton fibers. There are many cases of influenza, especially in winter and recently, because the temperature in the workshop is high and the temperature in the toilet is low, and workers catch cold when going out without adding clothes. The coke plant has a total of 431 employees and 1,582 family members, with 334 people falling ill in January, most of whom also suffered from colds; the second most common illness was gastrointestinal disease, the latter mainly because workers eat a lot of cold dry food. Recently, many employees of the electric light company have also suffered from gastrointestinal diseases. At the meeting, the person in charge of the Health Bureau pointed out the key points of factory health work in the future: (1) conducting health examinations for factory employees; (2) carrying out health education for employees; (3) cooperating with the epidemic prevention committee to do a good job in epidemic prevention work in each factory; (4) assisting in the organization of workers' health committees to cooperate in doing a good job in health work; (5) paying attention to improving environmental hygiene (including factories, dormitories, clubs, toilets, bathrooms, etc.). It was also stipulated that factory doctors should report their diagnosis and treatment and health work regularly to the Health Bureau in the future. At present, the personnel of the city's factory safety and health committee have conducted actual investigations at the Xinhua Weaving Factory under the Enterprise Company, and will continue to investigate at the Da Xing Yarn Factory, Coke Plant, and other places in the future. Based on the survey, specific measures to improve factory hygiene will be formulated.

　　石市卫生局、劳动局召开工厂医生会议加强职工卫生工作
    【本报讯】据石家庄日报二十日消息：石家庄市卫生局、劳动局于十日联合召开各国营、公营、私营工厂医生会议，该市总工会亦派员参加。会上各厂医生汇报了各该厂工人最近的得病人数及最近诊疗情形。据汇报：大兴纱厂共有职工一九二一人，家属三二二四人，每天平均门诊一百五十人至一百六十人；请病假的人数，一、二两月共三百八十四名（转送市立医院的一部分未统计在内）。死亡以肺结核为最多，七个月中即死亡七人。这主要是由于厂房空气太坏，棉絮乱飞，工人多半不戴口罩，吸入棉絮所致。冬季及最近流行性感冒特多，是由于工房温度高，厕所温度低，工人出去不加衣服而着凉。炼焦厂职工共四百三十一人，家属一千五百八十二人，一月份生病的达三百三十四人，其中也以患感冒者最多；其次为肠胃病，后者主要是因为工人多吃冷干粮所致。电灯公司职工中近亦有很多人患肠胃病。会上，卫生局负责人指出了今后工厂卫生工作的重点：（一）举行工厂职工健康检查；（二）开展职工卫生教育；（三）配合防疫委员会，做好各厂防疫工作；（四）协助组织工人卫生委员会，配合做好卫生工作；（五）注意改进环境卫生（包括厂房、宿舍、俱乐部、厕所、浴室等）。并规定今后各厂医生要将诊疗情况及卫生工作情形，定期向卫生局汇报。现在，该市工厂安全卫生委员会人员已到企业公司所属新华织布厂作实际调查，以后将继续到大兴纱厂、炼焦厂等处调查。根据调查情况，以拟订改善工厂卫生的具体办法。
