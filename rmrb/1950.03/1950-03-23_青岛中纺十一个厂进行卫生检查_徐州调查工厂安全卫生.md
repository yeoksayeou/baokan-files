    Qingdao Zhongfang's Eleven Factories Conduct Health Inspections
    Xuzhou Investigates Factory Safety and Hygiene
    [This newspaper reports] According to the Jinan Dazhong Daily on the 18th: Since the publication of the Tianjin factory hygiene inspection report, Qingdao and Xuzhou have begun to pay attention to factory hygiene work. As of the 16th, eleven factories of Qingdao Zhongfang Company have conducted health inspections. Each factory has formed a health inspection team composed of administrative, union, and medical personnel to conduct preliminary inspections of factories, dormitories, workshops, hospitals, nurseries, etc. The inspection results are roughly similar to the shortcomings pointed out in the Tianjin Hygiene Inspection Team report. For example, there is a lot of dust in the workshops, there are few and dirty spittoons, the drinking water is not clean, and the cloth yards are humid. The toilets in each factory are generally few and simple. For example, there are only four toilets for more than 580 people in the spinning department of Factory No. 1, and only two toilets for more than 450 people in the weaving department. Moreover, they are dirty and cold, and some are filled with odors. Garbage is dumped outside the staff dormitories. The female workers' dormitory in Factory No. 5 does not see sunlight all year round, and many female workers suffer from scabies. The safety equipment of the machines in each factory is generally poor. According to a survey in November last year, more than 170 workers were injured in five months. Each factory's clinic has only one or two doctors. Night shift workers account for more than one-third, but there are no night shift doctors. The workers' canteens are also mostly unclean. Except for Factory No. 8 and Factory No. 3, which have been steaming and heating the workers' lunches since November last year, the workers in other factories still eat cold food. The factory leadership institutions have not paid attention to these bad conditions left over from the period of reactionary bureaucratic capital rule after liberation, and there is an erroneous complacent mentality that "Zhongfang's sanitary equipment is good." After this inspection, most have realized the seriousness of this problem and have begun to make possible improvements. For example, Factory No. 1 held a major workshop clean-up on the 12th, and Factory No. 9 has begun to steam and heat dry food for workers, and each workshop has been equipped with hot water, boiling water, and water cups. However, this inspection is not universal and in-depth enough. Some factory unions do not pay attention to this work, and the administration does not cooperate with the union to carry out the inspection. For example, the union of the Shuttle Tube Factory did not participate in the inspection this time, and only the administration appointed a few people to conduct a rough inspection. This perfunctory attitude needs to be corrected urgently.
    The Xuzhou Municipal Labor Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Municipal Democratic Women's Federation jointly convened a meeting of cadres from public and private factories on the 15th to uniformly deploy the investigation of safety and health facilities in each factory. A representative of the Health Bureau explained at the meeting that the sanitary conditions of factories in the city urgently need to be improved. He said: According to a survey last year, 66 percent of the workers in the power plant suffer from trachoma, and on average one in fifteen people suffers from lung disease; one-fifth of the total number of employees of the Da Shanghai Match Factory see a doctor every month. This is all due to a lack of attention to hygiene. A representative of the Labor Bureau pointed out at the meeting that in the future, the factory administration should be primarily responsible for the safety and health work of each public and private factory, and the trade unions, youth federations, women's federations, etc. should actively cooperate. At present, a detailed investigation will be conducted on three items: factory safety equipment, urban factory fire prevention facilities, and hygiene facilities, which will be completed before the 25th and reported to the Labor Bureau for research and improvement.

　　青岛中纺十一个厂进行卫生检查
    徐州调查工厂安全卫生
    【本报讯】据济南大众日报十八日消息：自天津工厂卫生检查报告发表以后，青岛、徐州两市已开始注意工厂卫生工作。青岛中纺公司各厂，截至十六日止，已有十一个厂进行了卫生检查。各厂均由行政、工会结合医务人员组成卫生检查组，对工厂、宿舍、车间、医院、托儿所等都进行了初步检查。检查结果与天津卫生检查组报告所指出的缺点大体相似。如车间灰尘多，痰盂少而脏，饮水不洁，布场湿气重。各厂厕所普遍少而简陋，如一厂纺部五百八十余人只有四个厕所，织部四百五十余人只有两个厕所。而且又脏又冷，有的臭味充满了车间。职工宿舍室外乱倒着垃圾，五厂女工宿舍整年不见阳光，不少女工生疥疮。各厂机器安全设备普遍不好，据去年十一月调查：五个月受伤工人达一百七十多人。各厂卫生室只有一、二个医生，夜班工人占三分之一以上，但无夜班医生。工人食堂亦多不清洁，除八厂、三厂去年十一月起已为工人蒸热所带饭菜外，其他各厂工人仍吃冷饭。上述这些由反动的官僚资本统治时期所遗留下来的恶劣状况，解放后并未引起工厂领导机构的注意，而且存在着“中纺卫生设备好”的错误的自满情绪。经此次检查后，一般的已认识到这一问题的严重性，开始作可能的改进。如一厂已在十二日举行了车间大清扫，九厂已开始给工人蒸热干粮，每个车间已分设热水、开水和水杯。但这次检查还不够普遍和深入。有的厂工会还不重视此一工作，行政也不与工会配合进行。如梭管厂工会此次未参加检查，只由行政指定了几个人粗枝大叶地检查了一下，这种敷衍塞责的态度，亟待纠正。
    徐州市劳动局、公安局、卫生局、市总工会、市民主妇联等于十五日联合召开了各公私营工厂干部会议，统一布置各厂的安全卫生设施调查工作。卫生局代表在会上说明了该市各工厂卫生状况亟待改进。他说：据去年调查：水电厂工友患砂眼者占百分之六十六，十五个人中平均即有一人患肺病；大上海火柴厂每月看病的占全体职工的五分之一，这都是由于不重视卫生的结果。劳动局代表在会上指出今后各公私营工厂安全卫生工作应由工厂行政负起主要责任，工会、青联、妇联等积极配合进行。目前先就工厂安全设备、城市工厂防火设施及卫生设施等三项进行详细调查，于二十五日以前完成，报告劳动局，以便研究改进办法。
