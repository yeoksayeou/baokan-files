Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th Dispatch from TASS: The newspapers on the 17th published the decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the spring plowing campaign in collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms. The decision pointed out that in 1949, collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms all achieved new and great successes in agricultural development. Thanks to the large-scale assistance of the Soviet state and the high labor enthusiasm of collective farmers, workers of machine and tractor stations, and workers of state farms, agricultural work in 1949 was carried out in a more organized manner and in shorter farming seasons than in previous years, and the total agricultural output exceeded the pre-war level of 1940.

The decision continued: The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party believe that the achievements made in improving agriculture in 1949, as well as the enormous assistance given by the state to collective farms and state farms, have created all the necessary conditions for fulfilling the tasks of agriculture in 1950. These tasks are to further increase the yield and production of all crops, especially wheat, cotton, sugar beet, flax, hemp, ramie, etc., as well as to increase the production of tea and citrus fruits and to promote planting in new areas. Party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations must strengthen their attention to improving the organization of labor in collective farms and consolidating long-term production work teams, increasing the labor productivity of collective farmers, improving the work of backward collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms, providing them with necessary assistance, and, on the basis of increasing the yield of all crops and vigorously developing livestock breeding, enabling collective farms to achieve further organizational and economic consolidation in 1950. The most important current tasks for Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs, collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms are to rapidly complete all preparations for spring plowing and to carry out spring plowing in an organized manner.

The decision laid out a detailed plan for preparing and carrying out spring plowing. The measures for collective farms to prepare for spring plowing include: improving agricultural work plans and the organization of labor in collective farms; preparing seeds, agricultural implements, and draft animals; various agricultural technical measures and various methods of training personnel, etc. The measures formulated to enable machine and tractor stations to prepare for spring plowing include: timely repair and preparation of tractors and agricultural machinery, supply of fuel, conclusion of contracts between machine and tractor stations, machine, livestock, and forestry stations and collective farms, and supervision of their implementation, determination of work plans for machine and tractor stations, and preparation of personnel for them, etc. The decision also stipulated several measures for preparing state farms for spring plowing.
