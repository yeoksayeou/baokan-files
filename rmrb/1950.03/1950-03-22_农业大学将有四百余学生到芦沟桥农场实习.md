　　Agricultural University to Send Over 400 Students to Lugouqiao Farm for Internship
    [This newspaper's report] The Agricultural University's first-year students from nine departments, including Agronomy, Soil Science, and Animal Husbandry, have formed a labor internship class of over 490 students, scheduled to go to the Lugouqiao Farm on April 1st to participate in the internship. On the 16th, the internship class held a symposium of teachers and student representatives, listening to special reports from the university's Academic Dean Shen and others. The reports pointed out that the purpose of this internship is to combine the theories learned by the students in books with practice, and to learn methods of organizing farmers' production and managing cooperative farms. At the same time, it is also necessary to study and improve old agricultural practices. The university's Lugouqiao Farm originally belonged to the Agricultural College of Peking University and has more than 1,350 mu of land. In the past 50 years, the annual income was not enough to cover expenses, and many paddy fields became dry land. Nearby farmers laughed at them, saying that "the grass is taller than the crops." This year, it is planned to repair seven wells, restore 100 to 200 mu of paddy fields, and raise a large number of pigs to produce manure and accumulate fertilizer, so as to achieve intensive cultivation. The management method will also be changed, with farm workers, technicians, administrators, students, professors, and nearby farmers forming a cooperative farm, adopting a democratic work evaluation system and a "60% labor, 40% capital" profit-sharing method. In this way, students will not only learn technology during the internship, but also achieve the task of increasing production. The average annual total output of the farm is 80,000 jin of millet, and this year it is planned to increase it to 120,000 jin of millet.

　　农业大学将有四百余学生到芦沟桥农场实习
    【本报讯】农业大学农艺、土壤、畜牧等九系一年级同学顷组成四百九十余人的劳动实习班，预定四月一日赴芦沟桥农场参加实习。实习班于十六日举行了师生代表座谈会，听取了该校沈教务长等人的专题报告。报告中指出：这次实习的目的，就是使同学们在书本上所学的理论与实际相结合，并学习组织农民生产以及经营合作农场的方法。同时，还要研究改进旧的农业作法。该校芦沟桥农场原属北大农学院，有土地一千三百五十余亩，在过去五十多年中，每年收入不够开支，好多水地变成了旱地，附近农民笑他们“草比庄稼还长的高”。今年度计划修好水井七个，恢复一百至二百亩水地，并大量养猪，沤粪积肥，做到精耕细作。经营方式亦将改变，由农场工人、技术员、管理员、学生、教授和附近农民组成合作农场，采取民主评工制和“劳六资四”的分红办法。这样不仅使同学在实习中学到技术，同时也能达到增产任务。该场常年总产量平均八万斤小米，今年计划增加到十二万斤小米。
