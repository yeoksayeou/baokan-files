　　In Response to Requests from Thousands of Poor and Middle Peasants
　　Luo Guozeng Establishes Collective Farms
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd】According to a TASS report from Bucharest: Forty-seven new collective farms have been established in Romania, and on February 26th and 27th, these farms held founding celebration meetings one after another. These farms were established by the Romanian government and the Central Committee of the Workers' Party in response to the requests of thousands of poor and middle peasants. Due to the achievements of the first batch of fifty-six collective farms established last year, which vividly demonstrated to the peasants the benefits of collective cultivation using modern machinery to cultivate public land, many peasants requested that their land be incorporated into the collective farms and that their cattle and main production tools be owned collectively by the collective farms.

　　应成千贫农和中农请求
    罗国增建集体农场
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚新成立了四十七个集体农场，二月二十六日和二十七日，这些农场纷纷举行成立庆祝大会。这些农场是罗马尼亚政府和工人党中央委员会应成千的贫农和中农的请求而建立的。由于去年首批成立的五十六个集体农场的成就，向农民生动地说明了利用现代机器耕种公有土地的集体耕作的好处，许多农民遂要求把他们的土地划入集体农场，并把他们的耕牛和主要生产工具归集体农场公有。
