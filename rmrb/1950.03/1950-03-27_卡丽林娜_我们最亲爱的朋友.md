　　Kalinina
    Our Dearest Friend
    Li Yi
    Last October, the people of Chahar Province faced a severe disaster – the plague. A group of us intern medical personnel were transferred to Chahar to carry out the task of epidemic prevention. During the epidemic prevention work, I met a Soviet female epidemic prevention team member – Kalinina.
    She was in the same group as us and was assigned to the Second District of Zhangshi to carry out preventive injections. Her patient and enthusiastic attitude towards work confirmed what I had imagined in my heart long ago.
    When she was giving an injection to a three-year-old child, the child fearfully covered his face with his small hands and scurried into his mother's arms. But Kalinina was so patiently caressing him and giving him the candy she had brought, which finally calmed him down. But after the injection, the child cried again. So, like a mother, she held him in her arms, pressed her face tightly against his, and repeatedly called him "dear baby..." while strolling back and forth on the street. She didn't hand him over to his mother until the child stopped crying.
    Because of her amiable attitude, the other older children all scrambled to have her give them injections.
    After we changed shifts, we rested in a large room at the district office. She pulled me to sit down on a sofa and asked me to sing for her. I was about to sing the "National Anthem of the People's Republic of China" when she stopped me. I thought maybe she didn't understand it. So I changed to sing "The Internationale", but she stopped me again. She kept saying "Not good! Not good!" and told me that the national anthem and the internationale must be sung very seriously at a certain time and occasion, and it is not good to sing it casually. This kind of serious spirit deeply moved me. I then changed to sing "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China", and she sang along with me.
    Due to her sincere international friendship, her enthusiastic and patient help and guidance in our work, and in the two weeks of pleasant life together, I always regarded her as my own sister, admiring and respecting her (I later learned that she was two years younger than me). When I shook hands with her to say goodbye, I felt infinite reluctance.

　　卡丽林娜
    我们最亲爱的朋友
    李毅
    去年十月，察北人民面临着沉重的灾情——鼠疫。我们一群实习的医务人员，被调往察北执行防疫的任务。在防疫工作中，我认识了一位苏联女防疫队员——卡丽林娜。
    他和我们在一个小组，被分配到张市二区进行预防注射。她对工作的耐心而热情的态度，证实了我早在心目中的想像。
    当她给一个三岁的孩子注射的时候，孩子害怕地用小手掩着脸孔，往他的母亲怀里乱窜。而卡丽林娜却是那样耐心地爱抚着他，还把带着的糖果给他吃，终于使他安静下来了。可是打了一针，孩子又大哭起来。于是，她便向母亲似地，将他抱在怀里，用自己的脸紧贴着他的脸，连声唤着“亲爱的宝宝……”，在街上来回遛达。直到孩子不哭了，她才将他交给他的母亲。
    由于她的和蔼态度，别的大一些的孩子们，便都抢着让她注射。
    我们换了班后，在区公所一间大房子里休息。她拉着我在一个沙发上坐下，请我给她唱歌。我正要唱《中华人民共和国国歌》，却被她止住了。我想这也许是她嫌不懂。于是我便改唱《国际歌》，但又被她止住了。她连说“不好！不好！”并告诉我，国歌和国际歌必须在一定的时间，场合，很严肃地唱，随便唱它是不好的。这一种认真的精神，深深地感动了我。我又改唱“没有共产党就没有中国”，她也随着我唱了起来。
    由于她的真挚的国际友情，热情而耐心地帮助和指导我们工作，在两个多星期来共同愉快的生活中，我总把她当作自己的姐姐一样，钦佩和尊重着她（后来才知道她比我还小两岁）。当我与她握手告别时，感到无限的依恋。
