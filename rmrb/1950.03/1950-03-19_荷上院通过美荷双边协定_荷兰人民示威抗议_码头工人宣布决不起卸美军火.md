Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, March 16th: The Dutch Upper House, after fierce debate, approved the US-Dutch "Bilateral Agreement" on the delivery of US military supplies. The Dutch people protested one after another. Most dockworkers in Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other ports resolutely declared that they would not unload US war materials.

In the Upper House debate, Communist Party members resolutely protested the pro-American actions of approving this agreement. Communist Party member Sainton stated: "If you accept this agreement, we will appeal to the people to tell them that there are enemies within our country. We will call on the people to resist the government that implements this agreement." Communist Party member Schalker stated: "We speak on behalf of the people, and we demand that this agreement that endangers peace not be approved. We want the Netherlands to withdraw from the aggressive Atlantic Pact and establish friendly relations with all democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union!" Schalker continued: "Although you can approve this agreement, it does not mean that the people will accept it. We must protect our children and wives. We must do our best to stop military preparations. Today, we - the representatives of the people declare: We will do everything we can to undermine the imperialists' aggressive plans."

After the agreement was passed by a vote of twenty-seven to the Communist Party's four, working people in The Hague held a demonstration near the parliament, shouting slogans such as "Defend peace! Oppose war!" The police forcibly dispersed the demonstrators.

　　荷上院通过美荷双边协定
    荷兰人民示威抗议
    码头工人宣布决不起卸美军火
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社海牙十六日讯：荷兰上议院经过激烈辩论后，核准了关于交付美国军火的美荷“双边协定”，荷兰人民纷纷抗议。庆特丹、阿姆斯特丹和其他港口的大多数码头工人，坚决宣布他们将不起卸美国战争物资。
    在上议院辩论中，共产党议员坚决抗议批准这一协定的亲美行动。共产党议员圣敦称：“如果你们接受这个协定，我们将向人民呼吁，告诉他们在我们国家内部就有我们的敌人。我们将号召人民反抗履行这个协定的政府。”共产党议员夏尔克称：“我们代表人民来说话，我们要求不核准这一危害和平的协定。我们要荷兰退出侵略性的大西洋公约，并与所有民主国家，首先是与苏联建立友好关系！”夏尔克继称：“虽然你们可以核准这个协定，但这并不是说老百姓就会接受。我们一定要保护我们的孩子和妻子。我们一定要尽我们最大的力量来停止军事准备。今天，我们——人民的代表宣布：我们将尽一切力量来破坏帝国主义者的侵略计划。”
    在该协定以二十七票对共产党的四票通过以后，海牙的劳动人民在议会附近举行示威，高呼“保卫和平！反对战争！”的口号，警察用武力将示威者驱散。
