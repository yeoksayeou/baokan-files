Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: TASS, London, March 4th: An editorial in the British Communist Party's organ, the *Worker's Daily*, calls on every worker who desires peace to fight against the import of American weapons and military supplies under the North Atlantic Treaty. The paper points out: "The British people will not have security until this treaty and its war aims are abandoned." "The only way for Britain to be secure is to conclude a peace treaty between the major powers. Only on this basis can a mutually agreed reduction of armaments between countries be realized." The editorial concludes that it is the responsibility of the British working class to ensure that factories are used for peaceful production rather than war production.

    号召每一个希望和平的工人为英国安全反对美军火入口
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社伦敦四日讯：英共机关报《工人日报》社论，号召每一个希望和平的工人，为反对北大西洋公约项下的美国武器与军火入口而战斗。该报指出：“在这一公约及其战争宗旨没有被弃绝之前，英国人民便不会有安全。”“大国之间缔结和平公约，是英国唯一的安全之道，只有在这一基础上，各国之间协议一致的裁减军备方可能实现。”社论末称，英国工人阶级的责任，是使工厂用于和平生产而不是用于战争生产。
