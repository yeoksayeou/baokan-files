　　Launch a Mass Cottonseed Sorting Movement
    Chen Ren

    This year, the national plan is to expand cotton fields by more than 50 million mu, an increase of approximately 29 percent compared to 1949. Due to disasters in several major cotton-producing areas last year, especially typhoons in coastal areas and floods during the later stages of growth, such as in northern Jiangsu, Hubei, eastern Hebei, and Shaanxi, the harvest and the maturity of cottonseeds were severely affected. This has created some difficulties in terms of both the quantity and quality of cottonseeds needed for increased production this year. However, thanks to early attention from leadership, vigorous organization of seed selection and retention, and coordination, the preparation of cottonseeds in various regions has been basically resolved.

    The source of cottonseeds in various regions mainly relies on the masses selecting and retaining seeds locally, supplemented by government-organized coordination in areas with shortages. This includes building upon the existing foundation of improved varieties, and a plan to propagate and promote 10 million mu of American cotton improved varieties with 2,000 tons of cottonseed newly purchased from abroad. Because cotton is a crop that easily cross-pollinates, has a high degree of variability, and is produced as a commodity, the opportunities for mixing during transportation, sales, and processing are numerous. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to the quality of cottonseeds.

    Improving the quality of cottonseeds is one of the basic measures for increasing cotton production. How can this be improved? The main method is continuous seed selection. The widespread field seed selection and separate collection of improved varieties movement advocated and implemented in North China and many other regions in 1949 was launched for this purpose. In addition to field seed selection, another task that must be done at present is indoor cottonseed sorting.

    Experience has proven that unless it is an improved variety produced under strict management, ordinary improved varieties and common cottonseeds inevitably contain some bad seeds. If these seeds are sown and propagated, they will inevitably reduce the quality of cotton production. These types of bad seeds can generally be identified to a considerable extent by their shape and color. For example, American cotton seeds are generally large white seeds, among which mixed naked seeds (black seeds without fuzz), green seeds (cottonseed fuzz is short and green), and slightly fuzzy seeds (cottonseed fuzz is sparse) are definitely bad cottonseeds. There are also some other multicolored seeds and mixed-shaped seeds that have obvious differences in shape and color from the normal shape and color of this cotton seed, which may also be bad cottonseeds. In addition, some immature, damaged, or insect-infested cottonseeds will not germinate and develop well. The indoor cottonseed sorting work is to pick out the above-mentioned bad seeds to improve the quality and germination ability of cottonseeds.

    Indoor cottonseed sorting is a very detailed work. If it is done in large quantities and centrally, it is a heavy burden. Therefore, it must be handed over to the masses to master and rely on the masses to implement. The amount of cottonseeds used by each farmer is limited, and there are no technical difficulties in sorting. Everyone should seize the current relatively free time, and do it universally and separately. This is both simple and meticulous, and can maximize its effectiveness. Last year, Linqing promoted the Si Zi No. 2 cottonseed and called on the masses to implement seed selection by grain before sowing, which effectively improved the quality of the improved variety. Hebei Province has also paid attention to mobilizing this work early on. Now that the cotton sowing season is very near, all regions should seize the time and, under the specific leadership of the government, launch a mass, universal cottonseed sorting movement, and cultivate it into a habit of the masses. This will have a great effect on increasing cotton production and improving its quality.

### 展开群众性的挑检棉种运动

　　展开群众性的挑检棉种运动
    陈仁
    今年在全国计划扩大棉田五千多万亩，比一九四九年约增加百分之二十九。由于去年几个主要棉区都受到灾害，特别是沿海地区的台风和生长后期的水灾，如苏北、湖北、冀东、陕西等棉区，严重影响了收成和棉籽的成熟；对于今年增产所需的棉种，无论量和质上，都发生了一些困难。但经过领导上及早注意，大力组织选种留种，进行调剂，目前各地的棉种准备，基本上已经得到解决。
    各地棉种的来源，主要是依靠群众就地选种留种，不足的地区由政府组织调剂补充，其中并就原有的良种基础，和新自国外购进二千吨棉籽，计划繁殖推广美棉良种一千万亩。因为棉花是容易杂交的作物，变异性很大，又是商品性生产，经过运销加工，混杂的机会极多，所以棉种的品质，必须加以严格的注意。
    提高棉种的品质，是增产棉花的基本措施之一。如何可以提高呢？主要的方法是连续不断的选种。一九四九年华北和其他许多地区倡导实行的普遍田间选种和选良分收运动，就是为了此项目的而开展的。除田间选种以外，在目前还有一项必须做的工作，就是在室内的棉种挑检。
    根据经验的证明：除非经过严格管理所产生的良种，一般的良种和普通的棉种都不可免地杂有不好的种籽在内；这些种籽如经播种繁殖，必然要降低棉产的质量。这类不好的种籽，大都可以从形态和颜色上作相当的识别，如美棉种一般是大白籽，其中混杂的光籽（不带毛的黑籽）、绿籽（棉籽绒短而发绿色的）、微毛籽（棉籽短绒稀少的），都一定是不好的棉籽；还有一些和本棉种正常形状颜色有明显差异的其他杂色籽杂型籽，也都可能是不好的棉籽。此外还有一些不成熟的或破损的、被虫蛀的棉籽，是不会很好出芽和发育的。棉种的室内挑检工作，就是将上述的坏种籽挑检出去，以提高棉种的品质和发芽能力。
    棉种的室内挑检，是很细致的工作，如大量集中去做，是一个繁重的负担，所以必须交由群众来掌握，依靠群众来贯彻。每一农户所用的棉种数量有限，挑检工作技术上也没什么困难，大家抓紧当前的较空闲时间，普遍地分别来做，既很简便，又能精细，这样可发挥最大的功效。去年临清推广斯字二号棉种，曾号召群众在播种前实行粒选，有效地提高了良种的品质。今年河北省也早已注意发动这一工作。现在棉花播种季节已很近了，各地亟应把握时间，在政府具体领导下，展开群众性的普遍的挑检棉种运动，并要培养成为群众的习惯。这对于棉花增产质量的提高，是会发生很大的作用的。
