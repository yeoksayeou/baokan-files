Exhibition of Photos of the US-Chiang Kai-shek Joint Massacre
	Opens at the Palace Today

[This newspaper's dispatch] The "Exhibition of Photos of the US-Chiang Kai-shek Joint Massacre," jointly organized by the National Museum of the Revolution and the National Beijing Library, has attracted a large number of visitors since it opened at the Beijing Library on the 18th. Due to the relatively cramped space, it has become severely crowded. To facilitate viewing, all the photos were moved to the History Museum (Forbidden City) on the 20th, and the exhibition will continue today (the 21st). Organizations and groups wishing to visit should make prior arrangements to schedule their visits.

　　美蒋联合大屠杀照片
    今起在故宫展览
    【本报讯】国立革命博物馆与国立北京图书馆联合举办的“美蒋联合大屠杀照片展览”自十八日在北京图书馆展出以来，连日观众极多，加以该处房屋比较狭窄，致拥挤不堪。为了便利观众阅览，已于二十日将全部照片移至历史博物馆（故宫），今（二十一）日起继续展览。各机关团体前往参观，须事先接洽，以便排定参观次序。
