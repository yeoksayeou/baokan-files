Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: The "Izvestia" observer wrote in an international commentary on the 3rd, entitled "Indian Public Opinion Condemns Jessup": After the conclusion of the Bangkok Conference, the chairman of the conference, U.S. State Department representative Jessup, immediately went to India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. His mission was to persuade the governments of these countries to participate in the Pacific aggressive bloc planned to be organized at the Bangkok Conference. However, all his efforts were ineffective. No amount of hypocritical rhetoric and anti-communist clamoring can conceal the aggressive nature of American policy. Even from the comments of the Indian bourgeois press on Jessup's trip to India, this can be seen. The Indian News Chronicle stated: If Soviet troops, not French troops, were occupying Indochina, and if Soviet troops, not British troops, were occupying Malaya, then saying "the Soviet Union is imperialist" would be more convincing. If it was the Soviet Union, not the United States, that provided Chiang Kai-shek with the planes that bombed the ordinary residents of Shanghai, then saying "the Soviet Union is interfering" would be more convincing. The only kind of foreign rule that the people of Asian countries know is the rule of Western powers. The observer wrote: The comments of this Indian newspaper are a rude awakening for the American imperialists and their partners in plundering colonies.

　　印度舆论当头一棒
    耶塞普的谎言破产
    轰炸上海的是美制蒋机
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报观察家三日在题为《印度舆论谴责耶塞普》的国际评论中写道：在曼谷会议结束以后，这个会议的主席、美国国务院的代表耶塞普随即赴印度、巴基斯坦和阿富汗。他的任务是说服这些国家的政府去参加在曼谷会议中所计划好要组织的太平洋侵略集团。但是他的一切努力并未见效。任何虚伪的言论与反共叫嚣都掩盖不了美国政策中的侵略色彩。即使从印度资产阶级报纸对耶塞普印度之行的评论中，也可看出这一点来。印度新闻纪事报称：如果是苏联军队而不是法国军队占领着印度支那，如果是苏联军队而不是英国军队占领着马来亚，那末说“苏联是帝国主义”，才会更使人信服。如果是苏联而不是美国所给予蒋介石的飞机轰炸上海的普通居民，那末说“苏联干涉”，才会更使人信服。亚洲各国人民所知道的外来统治，只有一种，那就是西方强国的统治。观察家写道：这家印度报纸的评论，对于美国帝国主义者与其掠夺殖民地的伙伴们，是当头一棒。
