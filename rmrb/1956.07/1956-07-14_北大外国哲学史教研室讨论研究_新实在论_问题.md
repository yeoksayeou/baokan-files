    Peking University Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section Discusses the Study of "New Realism"

    (Our Newspaper News) The Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University held a forum on the afternoon of the 5th of this month to discuss how to critically study the modern bourgeois philosophical school of "New Realism."  About thirty people attended the forum, including Zheng Xin, Jin Yuelin, and Feng Youlan. They all spoke freely at the meeting in the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom."

    The first topic discussed was whether "New Realism" belonged to objective idealism or subjective idealism. Many comrades believed that the New Realists mainly referred to the six professors in the United States, including Montague, Perry, and Holt, who advocated that "universals" "subsist" apart from concrete things. This is objective idealism rather than subjective idealism. As for the subjective idealism of Russell in his later years and Moore, it could not be considered "New Realism" at all. Many comrades believed that "New Realism" could have broad and narrow definitions. The broad definition of "New Realism" included Moore, Russell, and others. Therefore, it is impossible to say generally that "New Realism" belongs to subjective idealism or objective idealism. Some comrades believed that the "realism" of the Middle Ages recognized "universals" as the most real, while "New Realism" recognized concrete things as the most real, and "universals" were only "subsisting." This was a concession of "New Realism" to materialism. Some comrades also believed that "New Realism" admitted the objective existence of things, and their nature was not affected by human understanding, which was its materialistic element.

    The meeting also discussed whether "New Realism" had anything that could be affirmed. Many comrades believed that although "New Realism" itself was objective idealism, it was put forward under the banner of opposing idealism, and it made some concessions to materialism. It admitted the existence of objective things, which could still be affirmed.

    Many comrades pointed out that for modern bourgeois philosophies like "New Realism," it is much more difficult to affirm something in it than to criticize it. While affirming a certain point of it, more detailed and thorough criticism must be made. However, everyone believed that this work should be done, because the purpose of our doing this work is mainly not to "find gold in the sand," but to make our criticism more detailed and thorough.

    The comrades who participated in this forum felt that such a meeting was very enlightening and hoped to hold more such forums in the future. (Zhang Shiying)

    北大外国哲学史教研室讨论研究“新实在论”问题
    本报讯　北京大学哲学系外国哲学史教研室于本月五日下午举行了座谈会，讨论如何批判研究现代资产阶级哲学派别——“新实在论”的问题。出席这次座谈会的有郑昕、金岳霖、冯友兰等共三十余人。他们都本着“百家争鸣”的精神在会上畅谈了自己的意见。
    首先谈到的是“新实在论”究竟属于客观唯心论还是属于主观唯心论的问题。许多同志认为新实在论者主要是指美国的孟太鸠、倍里、何尔特等六教授而言，他们主张“共相”离开具体事物而“潜存”，这是客观唯心论而不是主观唯心论；至于罗素晚期以及莫尔等人的主观唯心论，那根本不能算是“新实在论”。许多同志认为，“新实在论”可以有广狭二义，广义的“新实在论”包括莫尔、罗素等人在内；因此，不能笼统说“新实在论”属于主观唯心论或客观唯心论。有的同志认为中世纪的“实在论”认“共相”为最真实，“新实在论”则认具体事物最真实，而“共相”不过是“潜存”，这是“新实在论”对唯物论的让步。也有的同志认为“新实在论”承认事物客观存在，其性质不因人的认识而受影响，这是其唯物论的因素。
    会上还谈到了“新实在论”是否有可以肯定之处的问题。许多同志认为，“新实在论”虽然本身是客观唯心论，但它是在反对唯心论的旗帜下提出来的，它对唯物论作了些让步，他承认客观事物的存在，这还是可以肯定的。
    许多同志指出：对于像“新实在论”这样的现代资产阶级哲学，要对它肯定一点甚么东西，那比起批判它来要困难得多；在肯定它的某一点的同时，必须作更多的、细致的批判。不过，大家认为这个工作是应该做的，因为我们做这工作的目的，主要还不是要在“沙里淘金”，而是要使我们的批判做得更细致、更彻底。
    参加这次座谈会的同志都感到这样的会很能启发思想，希望以后多举行这样的座谈会。（张世英）
