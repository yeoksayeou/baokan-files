    Critic—Not a Judge
    Fang Pu
    Literary creation is a complex labor. To comment on a literary work, one cannot simply use a "good" or "bad" to summarize it, like distinguishing black and white colors. Some works have meaningful themes but poor artistic expression; some have vivid character descriptions but lack profound ideological content; some only have a few well-written characters, and so on. In short, the situation is very complex.
    A critic is also a reader. His task is to write down his views and feelings about the work, to help readers better understand the work, and also to explore these issues together with the writer. The critic's opinion may be basically correct, or mostly correct, or even incorrect. Because every critic is limited by his own level of thought and artistic cultivation. It often happens that some works depicting a life familiar to the critic more easily arouse his emotional resonance, while other works may be the opposite, less able to arouse his resonance, even though the ideological and artistic achievements of these two works may be similar. The critic's personal preferences should also be allowed and respected.
    However, what the critic says in the article is only his personal opinion, not a judgment on the work; no one has given him this right. Dobrolyubov said it well, he believed that critics are not judges, but lawyers. The right to judge works belongs only to history.
    Writers are interpreters of life, and critics are interpreters of art. As writers can express their views on life, critics can of course also express their views on art. Their views are originally subject to the reader's choice and consideration. But if criticism is regarded as a judgment, writers and critics cannot but become very nervous about literary criticism. Since a review article directly determines the fate of one or even several works, judging their life or death, how can the critic not write tremblingly? How can he not try to write the article as "comprehensive" as possible, even if he doesn't like the work, he has to try to find some of its advantages, affirm them, and then criticize on the basis of the so-called affirmation? And how can writers not feel a sense of "talking about tigers" when they hear criticism?
    It is very common for works to have shortcomings, even mistakes. No work is without shortcomings. It is also very common to publish some criticisms of works. Critics can certainly make criticisms, and writers also have the right and responsibility to express their different views and launch counter-criticisms. The debate between writers and critics is not "fratricide," but for the common interests of literary and artistic undertakings. As long as critics do not regard themselves as judges, and readers do not mistake them for judges, then their work will be easier to do well, and their relationship with writers can be more natural. Truth becomes clearer with debate, and what does it matter even if there is a momentary blush?

    批评家—不是法官
    方浦
    文艺创作是一种复杂的劳动。评论一部文艺作品，不能像分辨颜色的黑白那样，简单地用一个“好”字或者“坏”字来概括。有的作品，主题很有意义，但艺术表现非常差；有的作品，人物描写比较生动，但思想内容不深刻；也有的作品，仅某几个人物写得比较好，等等。总之，情况十分复杂。
    批评家也是读者，他的任务是写出自己对作品的看法和感想，帮助读者更好地理解作品，同时也和作家一起去探讨这些问题。批评家的意见可能基本上正确，或者大部分正确，或者也竟不正确。因为每个批评家都受着他自己的思想水平和文艺修养的限制。往往有这种情形：某些作品所描写的生活为批评家熟悉的，比较容易引起他在感情上的共鸣，而另一些作品则可能相反，不大能引起他的共鸣，尽管这两部作品也许在思想上、艺术上的成就是差不多的。批评家这种个人爱好，也应该受到容许和尊重。
    然而批评家在文章里说的毕竟只是他个人的意见，而不是对作品的判决；谁也没有给过他这种权利。杜布洛留勃夫说的很对，他认为批评家不是法官，而是律师。对作品的判决，权利只能属于历史。
    作家是生活的解释者，批评家是艺术的解释者。对于生活，作家既然可以各抒所见，对于艺术，批评家当然也可以各抒所见，他们的所见本来都有待于读者的选择和思考的。但是如果批评被认为是判决，作家和批评家对待文艺批评便不能不十分紧张起来。既然一篇评论文章直接决定着一部、甚至好些部作品的命运，判决它们生或死，批评家写的时候又怎么会不战战兢兢呢？他又怎能够不把文章尽量写得十分“全面”，即使不喜欢这部作品，也得努力找出它的某些优点，加以肯定，并在所谓肯定的基础上加以批评呢？而作家们又怎么会不一听到批评，便有“谈虎色变”之感呢？
    作品有缺点，甚至错误，是极平常的事。任何一部作品都不免有缺点。对作品发表一些批评，也是极平常的事。批评家固然可以进行批评，作家也有权利和责任发表自己的不同看法，展开反批评。作家和批评家之间的争论并不是“相煎”，而是为了文学艺术事业的共同利益。只要批评家不自居为法官，读者也不错认他们为法官，那么，他们的工作就容易作得好一些，他们跟作家之间的关系也就可以自然一些。真理总是愈辩愈明的，即使有片刻的面红耳赤，又算得了什么呢？
