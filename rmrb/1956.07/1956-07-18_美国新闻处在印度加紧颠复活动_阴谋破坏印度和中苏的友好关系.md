    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 15th. According to the latest issue of "Blitz" weekly, the U.S. Information Service has planned to intensify its activities throughout India in order to undermine the development of friendly cooperation between India, the Soviet Union, and People's China.

    Recently, senior officials of the U.S. Embassy and personnel from the U.S. Information Service stationed in Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Guntur, Trivandrum, Madras, and Bangalore held a meeting in New Delhi. At this meeting, they felt that the current activities of the U.S. Information Service were "inadequate, inflexible, slow, and often crude, which might hinder rather than promote U.S. interests in this country."

    It has now been decided to intensify activities "to win the trust of ministers, leaders, and officials." An action plan has been formulated to overcome the failures the U.S. Information Service's propaganda has encountered so far, including: providing funding for the activities of pro-American organizations such as the "Democratic Research Society" in Bombay and the "Asian Liberation League" in Calcutta; launching propaganda campaigns against the Soviet Union and China in controlled newspapers and preparing "intelligence" for these newspapers to undermine friendly relations between India and the Soviet Union and between India and China; and encouraging "anti-Indian activities aimed at subverting the Nehru government." It has been decided to immediately increase the appropriations to the U.S. Information Service to achieve these goals.

    The news concludes by saying that "the U.S. Information Service's subversive activities have been exposed more than once, and some U.S. Information Service personnel have been sent back home following protests from Delhi."

    美国新闻处在印度加紧颠复活动
    阴谋破坏印度和中苏的友好关系
    新华社新德里15日电　据最近一期的“闪电”周报说，美国新闻处已经计划加紧在印度各地的活动，以破坏印度、苏联和人民中国之间的友好合作的发展。
    最近，美国大使馆的高级官员们和美国新闻处驻德里、孟买、加尔各答、贡图尔、特里凡得琅、马德拉斯和班加罗尔的人员在新德里举行了会议。在这次会议上，他们认为美国新闻处目前的活动“是不充分的、不灵活的、缓慢的，而且时常是粗鲁的，可能妨碍而不是促进美国在这个国家的利益”。
    现在已经决定要加紧活动，“以争取部长们、领袖们和官员们的信任”。已经制定了一个克服美国新闻处的宣传迄今为止所遭到的失败的行动计划，其中包括：为孟买的“民主研究会”和加尔各答的“亚洲解放联盟”等亲美组织的活动提供经费；在控制的报纸上发动反对苏联和中国的宣传运动和为这些报纸准备“情报”以破坏印苏和印中的友好关系；并且鼓励“目的在于颠复尼赫鲁政府的反印活动”。已经决定立即增加给予美国新闻处的拨款，以实现这些目的。
    消息最后说，“美国新闻处的颠复活动已经不止一次地被揭露了真相，在德里方面的抗议下已经有一些美国新闻处人员被送回国去”。
