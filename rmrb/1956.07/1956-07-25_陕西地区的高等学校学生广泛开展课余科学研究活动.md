    Universities and colleges in Shaanxi province
    Widely develop extracurricular scientific research activities
    (Our newspaper reports) This year, during the first half of the year, students from nine universities and colleges in the Shaanxi region responded to the Party's call to march towards science and widely carried out scientific research activities in their spare time. As of now, student scientific research groups have been established in various universities and colleges, with a total of 177 groups, nearly doubling the number from the second half of last year. The number of students participating in scientific research is 1,307, accounting for 13.6% of the total number of students in various universities and colleges, an increase of more than six and a half times compared to the second half of last year. The content of scientific research conducted by the groups has become increasingly rich and diverse. Some groups conduct experiments, observations, collect, read, and organize necessary reference materials; some manufacture instruments, models, or carry out design work; some invite teachers and experts to give academic reports or introduce research methods in connection with research topics; and others visit scientific research institutions, production departments, and buildings related to research topics, and so on. For example, the "Eucalyptus Overwintering Observation Group" of the Forestry Department's Afforestation Class of the second grade at Northwest Agricultural College mainly carries out overwintering treatment and growth observation of eucalyptus seedlings in the experimental field. In addition, they also read relevant reference books, take some notes and discussions, and invited three teachers to give them three academic reports and introductions on scientific research methods. The third-grade scientific research group of the Chemistry Department of Northwest University produced three kinds of instruments, such as "constant voltage regulator," "three-component phase diagram," and "corrected balance weight." In order to guide the high-yield cotton fields of the Duyuanbao Agricultural Cooperative in Wugong County, the third-grade students of the Plant Protection Department of Northwest Agricultural College organized a "Comprehensive Cotton High-Yield Technology Group." Through the research activities of the group, the cotton planting technology of the agricultural cooperative was improved, and the scientific knowledge level of the students was enriched and improved. In this year's graduation practice of Northwest Institute of Technology, 159 students from the Mechanical Engineering Department alone proposed 155 rationalization proposals, designed 129 jigs, tools, and measuring tools, and drafted and revised 201 process specifications through scientific research activities.
    The Communist Youth League organizations of some universities and colleges have been or are assisting the school administration and the Student Scientific Research Association to summarize the student scientific research activities of the past six months. It is expected that the student scientific research activities in universities and colleges in Shaanxi Province will be more vigorously carried out in the next semester.

    陕西地区的高等学校学生
    广泛开展课余科学研究活动
    本报讯　今年上半年陕西地区九所高等学校的学生，响应党关于向科学进军的号召，在课余时间广泛开展了科学研究活动。截至目前为止，各院校学生已成立了科学研究小组177个，比去年下半年增加了将近两倍；参加科学研究的学生有1，307人，占各院校学生总人数的13.6％，比去年下半年增加了六倍半。科学研究小组研究的内容已日益丰富和多样。有的进行试验、观察，收集，阅读和整理必要的参考资料；也有的制造仪器、模型或进行设计工作；有的结合研究题目请教师和专家作学术报告或介绍研究方法；还有的参观和访问与研究题目有关的科学研究机关、生产部门和建筑物，等等。如西北农学院林学系造林二年级“桉树越冬观察小组”的主要活动是在实验地里进行桉树幼苗的越冬处理及生长情况的观察。另外，他们还阅读有关参考书，作一些札记和讨论，并请三位教师给他们作了三次学术性报告和关于科学研究方法的介绍。西北大学化学系三年级科学研究小组制作了“恒稳器”、“三成分相图”、“校正天平法码”等三种仪器。西北农学院植物保护系三年级学生为了指导武功县杜袁堡农业社棉花丰产田，组织了一个“棉花丰产综合技术小组”，通过小组的研究活动，既提高了农业社棉花种植技术，又充实和提高了学生的科学知识水平。西北工学院今年学生毕业实习中，只机械系159名学生通过科学研究活动，就提出各种合理化建议155件，设计卡具、刀具和量具129个，拟定和修定工艺规程201项。
    有的院校的青年团组织已经或正在协助学校行政和学生科学研究协会对半年来的学生科学研究活动进行总结，预计下学期陕西地区高等学校的学生科学研究活动将会更加蓬勃开展。
