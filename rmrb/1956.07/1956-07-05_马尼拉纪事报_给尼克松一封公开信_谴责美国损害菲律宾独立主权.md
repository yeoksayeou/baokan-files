Xinhua News Agency, Manila, July 4th: The "Manila Chronicle" published an open letter on July 3rd to US Vice President Nixon, who arrived in Manila that day, condemning the independence granted to the Philippines by the United States as having become a "laughing stock," and pointed out that this independence is "independence without sovereignty."

The "Manila Chronicle," in its open letter published on the front page, said that the independence granted to the Philippines by the United States has become a "laughing stock" in the face of the unequal clauses in the military base agreement regarding the cruel exercise of extraterritorial rights by US officials, the harsh conditions of Philippine trade with the United States, and the infamous bill granting Americans "equal rights" in the Philippines.

The "Manila Chronicle" said to Nixon: "All we ask of you is to open your eyes and ears to the facts. Do not allow yourself to be deceived by the optimistic reports on Philippine-American relations prepared in advance by Filipinos who need to keep their jobs and Americans who need to continue their fraudulent activities."

The open letter also stated: "The fact you must recognize is that the United States can no longer prevent Filipinos from trying out their national sovereignty. Call it Filipinism, call it nationalism, call it whatever you like, but the independence movement is advancing."

    “马尼拉纪事报”给尼克松一封公开信
    谴责美国损害菲律宾独立主权
    据新华社4日讯　马尼拉消息：“马尼拉纪事报”七月三日给当天到达马尼拉的美国副总统尼克松一封公开信，谴责美国给予菲律宾的独立已成了一种“笑料”，并指出这种独立是“没有主权的独立”。
    “马尼拉纪事报”在它的登载在第一版的公开信中说，在军事基地协定中关于美国官员可以残酷地行使治外法权的不平等条款面前，在菲律宾同美国进行贸易的苛刻条件面前，在给予美国人在菲律宾以“平等权利”的不名誉法案面前，美国给予菲律宾的独立已经成了一种“笑料”。
    “马尼拉纪事报”对尼克松说：“我们所要求你的只是要你对事实打开眼睛和耳朵。不要让你自己被需要保住自己的饭碗的菲律宾人和需要继续进行骗子活动的美国人所事先准备好的关于菲美关系的乐观报告所欺骗”。
    这封公开信还说：“你们必须认识的事实是，美国再不能阻止菲律宾人来试行他们国家的主权了。叫它是菲律宾主义也好、叫它是民族主义也好、你喜欢叫它什么就叫它什么，但是，独立运动在前进。”
