Reading "Internal News of This Newspaper"
    Lù Xīzhì

I finished reading Liu Binyan's "Internal News of This Newspaper" ("People's Literature" June 1956) in one breath. This feature article first attracted me with the novelty of its subject matter. Its sharp exposure of backward things in life made me feel the author's positive demands for creativity. What moved me most was the author's enthusiasm and sense of responsibility to intervene in life as much as possible.

The character Zhang Ye is successfully portrayed. The episodes about this character written in the feature vividly embody his personality. Cleverly catering to the personal wishes of the editor-in-chief everywhere, and instinctively considering issues from the perspective of personal gains and losses at all times, are this person's principles and habits in life. Of course, he doesn't want to clumsily expose his soul, but wants to skillfully make it difficult for people to identify. On the outside, he lets people see his extraordinary appearance and sparkling talent. He also has a great deal of self-confidence. In that special environment he is in, he seems to have become worldly-wise. He seems to have cleverly recognized the laws of the development of things in that environment, and can skillfully combine them with his own personal interests. However, his understanding of the "laws of life's development" is not enough: his sophistication ran into a snag in the face of Huang Jiaying's character! ...

The descriptions of Huang Jiaying in the feature article have also been attracting me. In my opinion, this is a beautiful young character close to the Nastasya type. However, this character's impression on me is not very deep yet. The feature article cannot make me understand her more specifically, like understanding Nastasya. I think, perhaps this is because the author used a lot of ink to describe her, but less to describe her deep struggle? I have the same feeling for another character - Ma Wenyuan. Of course, the contradictions of this character described in the feature are still attractive. However, I have not felt the deep and vivid expression of his character. Could it be that Huang Jiaying's conversation with him in the editor-in-chief's office has been sufficiently profound in expressing his character? It seems like a joke to say that this work has a tendency towards "non-conflict theory"; however, it is true that the author has not yet expressed character well from conflict.

The author said that he will continue to write, and the real sharp conflict will unfold in the next article. That's great. In fact, almost every character the author has put forward has attracted our attention and interest (even Cao Mengfei, who seems to have not yet received the author's attention, is already powerfully involving me). We are eagerly awaiting the content of the conflict in the next article.

    读“本报内部消息”
    陆希治
    一口气读完了刘宾雁的“本报内部消息”（“人民文学”1956年6月号）。这篇特写首先以它的题材的新鲜吸引了我。它的揭发生活中的落后事物的尖刻，又使我感到作者对创造性的积极的要求。最使我感动的，是作者的尽其所能地干预生活的热情和责任感。
    张野这个人物是刻划得成功的。特写所写的关于这个人物的情节，生动地体现了这个人物的性格。处处聪明地迎合那位总编辑的个人愿望，时时本能地按个人得失的观点考虑问题，是这个人的生活的原则和习惯。当然，他并不想笨拙地把他的灵魂暴露出来，而是想巧妙地让它难于被人识辨。在外面，他让人看到的是仪表不凡，才华闪烁。他也很有一帆风顺的自信心。在他所处的那个特殊环境里，他似乎已经老于世故。他似乎已经聪明地认识了那个环境里的事物发展的规律，并且能熟练地使它和自己的个人利益灵巧地结合起来。可是，他对于“生活发展的规律”到底是认识不够的：他的老练，在黄佳英的性格面前碰了钉子！……
    特写对黄佳英的那些描写，也一直在吸引着我。照我看来，这是一个近乎娜斯嘉型的优美的青年人物。不过，这个人物给我的印象，也还不很深刻。特写还不能使我更具体地了解她，像具体地了解娜斯嘉那样。我想，也许这是因为作者虽然用了不少的笔墨去描写她，却较少描写她的深刻的斗争的原故吧？对于另一个人物——马文元，我也有着同样的感受。当然，特写所描写的这个人物的矛盾，还是吸引人的。但是，他的性格的深刻生动的表现，我却还没有感到。难道黄佳英和他在总编室里的那一场谈话，对他的性格的表现已经足够深刻了吗？说这个作品还有“无冲突论”的倾向，那似乎是笑话；但是，作者还没有很好地从冲突中表现性格，却是的确的。
    作者说，他还要继续写下去，真正的尖锐的冲突将在下一篇内展开。这太好了。事实上，几乎作者所提出的每一个人物，都引起了我们的注意和兴趣（甚至那个似乎还没有受到作者重视的曹梦飞，也已经在有力地牵扯着我），我们迫切地期待着下一篇里的冲突的内容。
