    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: More than three thousand South Vietnamese people gathered in Hanoi last night to endorse the proposition put forward by President Ho Chi Minh in his message to the people, expressing their determination to fight for the reunification of their country. Those attending included South Vietnamese workers, students, intellectuals, soldiers, cadres, religious figures, and ethnic minorities who had gathered in North Vietnam and were working and studying in Hanoi.

    The meeting passed a letter to the people of South Vietnam. The letter expressed indignation at the crimes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in sabotaging the Geneva Accords, undermining the reunification of Vietnam, and persecuting the South Vietnamese people. It also expressed admiration and concern for the struggle of the South Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of the country and against the dictatorial and terroristic rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.

    The letter also informed the South Vietnamese people about the thoughtful care given to the South Vietnamese cadres and people who had gathered in North Vietnam by the government.

    Pham Hung, former Chairman of the Eastern Nam Bo Resistance Administrative Committee and currently Minister of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered a report at the meeting on the issue of peaceful reunification of the country, emphasizing that the Vietnamese people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland would surely be victorious.
