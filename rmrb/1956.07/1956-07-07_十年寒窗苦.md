    “Ten Years of Hard Study”
    Fan Rongkang

    In the midst of the wage reform, there came the complaint, "Ten years of hard study, and still only one hundred and fifty."

    Those who voice this kind of complaint are mostly college or vocational school graduates. Although they have studied for more than ten years, they have just started working and have not yet been evaluated for a grade, so they are considered interns. Their salary is one hundred and fifty yuan, or one hundred and forty yuan, or one hundred and ninety yuan. In short, the salary is relatively low.

    In the past, such complaints might not have attracted much attention; but in the midst of wage reform, they have gained considerable sympathy, and many people are taking up the cudgels for them.

    If the dissatisfaction with "still only one hundred and fifty" is because one has been working for several years, one's work ability has improved, but one is still an "intern," still only earning one hundred and fifty, this complaint is reasonable and deserves sympathy. Because in this situation, "still only one hundred and fifty" does not conform to the socialist principle of distribution according to work.

    If the dissatisfaction with "still only one hundred and fifty" is because one has special talents and learning, and although one is a student who has just graduated from school, one can undertake more work, and a salary of one hundred and fifty yuan is indeed low, yet it is "still only one hundred and fifty," this complaint is also reasonable and deserves sympathy. Because in this situation, "still only one hundred and fifty" also does not conform to the socialist principle of distribution according to work.

    If the reason for dissatisfaction with "still only one hundred and fifty" is simply because one has tasted the "bitterness of ten years of hard study," then this complaint is unreasonable and should not be sympathized with. A college or vocational school graduate who has just started working and receives one hundred and fifty yuan earns much more than a worker who has just entered the factory. This already takes into account the "ten years of hard study." Moreover, as long as one achieves success in one's work, one's rank can be raised, and one's salary can increase. Therefore, having tasted the "bitterness of ten years of hard study" and being unwilling to "still only receive one hundred and fifty," and going to fight for "should be two hundred and fifty," this kind of demand has no positive significance and has nothing in common with the socialist principle of distribution according to work.

    It is not surprising to hear complaints like "ten years of hard study, and still only one hundred and fifty." In the old society, there was a saying, "Endure the utmost hardship to become a man above men." This was a dose of poison that the men above gave to the men below. Although the men below saw no sign of advancement even after enduring the utmost hardship, some people still liked to use this to comfort, or even encourage, themselves. Being deceived by the men above and wanting to squeeze into the ranks of the men above, this is where the poison lies. Now there are no men above men, but there are differences in wages. People with the remnants of this kind of thinking, having tasted the "bitterness of ten years of hard study," feel that they have endured the utmost hardship. If they do not become men above men, how can they not complain about "still only one hundred and fifty"? In the old society, there was also a saying, "All occupations are inferior, only studying is noble." People with the remnants of this kind of thinking, having tasted the "bitterness of ten years of hard study," think they are superior to others, and of course, they are unwilling to "still only receive one hundred and fifty." Therefore, it is not surprising to hear this kind of complaint.

    What is surprising is that some people, and even some enterprise leaders, deeply sympathize with these complaints, which clearly should not be sympathized with, and even take up the cudgels for them.

    This leads me to think: Although wage reform is a happy event, it may not be universally pleasing. Because everyone has their own demands on wage reform, some of which are reasonable, and some of which are unreasonable. Unreasonable demands will certainly not be met, and not all reasonable demands can be met by this wage reform. Therefore, when carrying out wage reform, it is necessary to carefully distinguish the situation and do more ideological work. One must not think that wage reform is simply a matter of giving everyone a few more dollars and therefore, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, lavishly show sympathy and make broad promises. If that is the case, a good thing will be spoiled.

    “十年寒窗苦”
    范荣康
    在工资改革声中，传来了“十年寒窗苦，还是一百五”的怨言。
    发这类怨言的，大多是一些大学毕业，或者是专科学校毕业的学生，他们虽然读了十多年书，但是刚刚参加工作，还没有评定级别，算是实习生，工资是一百五十分，也有一百四十分的，也有一百九十分的。总之，工资是较低的。
    要是在往日，这类怨言恐怕未必引人注意；但在工资改革声中，却颇得一些人的同情，代抱不平者大有人在。
    不满于“还是一百五”，若是因为参加工作好几年了，工作能力提高了，还在“实习”，还是一百五，这怨得有理，值得同情。因为在这种情况下，“还是一百五”，是不符合按劳付酬的社会主义分配原则的。
    不满于“还是一百五”，若是因为自己有特殊的才学，虽然是刚从学校毕业的学生，也能担负较多的工作，一百五十分的工资确实低了，可是却“还是一百五”，这也怨得有理，值得同情。因为在这种情况下，“还是一百五”，也是不符合按劳付酬的社会主义分配原则的。
    如果不满于“还是一百五”的原因，只是因为尝过“十年寒窗苦”，这就怨得没有道理了，不该同情。一个刚参加工作的大、专学校毕业生，拿一百五十分，比起一个刚进厂的工人所得到的报酬，已经高得多了。这里面就已经照顾到“十年寒窗”的情况。况且，只要在工作中有成就，等级是可以升的，工资是可以长的。因此，尝过“十年寒窗苦”，就不甘于“还是一百五”，就去争“应该二百五”，这种要求是没有积极意义的，它同按劳付酬的社会主义分配原则没有什么相同之处。
    有“十年寒窗苦，还是一百五”之类的怨言，倒不奇怪。旧社会里有一句话，叫“吃尽苦中苦，方为人上人”，这是当时人上人给人下人吃的一剂毒药。人下人吃尽苦中苦，虽不见什么出头之兆，但确实还是有些人喜欢拿这句话来自慰，甚至自勉。受人上人之欺，又想挤入人上人之列，这就是毒之所在。如今没有什么人上人了，工资的差别倒是有的。有上面这种思想余毒的人，尝过“十年寒窗苦”，觉得是吃尽苦中苦了，不为人上人，怎么能不怨“还是一百五”呢？旧社会里还有一句话，叫“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”。有这种思想余毒的人，尝过“十年寒窗苦”，自以为高人一等，当然也不甘于“还是一百五”。所以说有这类怨言并不奇怪。
    奇怪的是竟有人，而且还是些企业的领导人，对这类分明是不该同情的怨言深表同情，甚至代抱不平。
    由此想到：工资改革虽是件喜事，却未必能皆大欢喜。因为人人对工资改革都有自己的要求，其中有合理的，也有不合理的。不合理的要求固然不可能得到满足，合理的要求也不是这一次工资改革都能满足得了的。因此，进行工资改革的时候，要认真区别情况，多做思想工作，切不可认为工资改革就是随随便便给每个人加几个钱，因而不管是与不是，滥施同情，广许心愿。要是那样的话，好事就给办坏了。
