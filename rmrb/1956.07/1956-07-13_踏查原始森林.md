Xinhua News Agency: The forest survey team dispatched by the Ministry of Forestry has begun surveying the virgin forest in the Bomi area of the Great Bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River.

Tibet has abundant forest reserves. There are large areas of virgin forest in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Himalayan Mountains, producing a variety of precious timber. The forest survey team will conduct a more comprehensive understanding of the forests in the Tibet region.

Xinhua News Agency: Hubei Province's forest resources census has been fully launched. Five forest resource survey teams, composed of nearly sixty forestry technicians, are now conducting investigations into the distribution, types, reserves, and growth of forests in the mountainous areas of the Qingjiang River basin in the west of the province, the Wudang Mountains in the north, and the Dabie Mountains in the east. The "Shennongjia" virgin forest (located in the northwest of the province), which has always been considered a blank spot in Hubei Province's forest resource survey work, currently has eight survey members conducting a more comprehensive survey.

    踏查原始森林
    据新华社讯　林业部派出的森林踏查组已经开始踏查雅鲁藏布江大湾曲处波密地区的原始森林。
    西藏的森林蕴藏量很丰富，雅鲁藏布江中游和喜马拉雅山区都有大面积的原始森林，出产多种名贵的木材。森林踏查组将对西藏地区的森林作一次较全面的了解。
    据新华社讯　湖北省森林资源的普查工作已经全面展开。将近六十个林业技术干部组成的五个森林资源踏查队，现在正在这个省的西部清江流域山区、北部武当山和东部大别山等地带进行森林的分布、种类、蓄积量和生长情况的调查工作。历来被认为是湖北省森林资源调查工作上一个空白点的“神农架”原始森林（位于这个省的西北部），目前也有八个踏查队员在专门作比较全面的调查。
