Some Units in Heilongjiang Abusing Enterprise Bonuses
Gao Xuexian

Every year, each enterprise unit implementing economic accounting, according to state regulations, allocates a certain percentage of planned and surplus profits to the enterprise bonus fund, using a portion to improve the material and cultural life of employees. However, some enterprise units in Heilongjiang Province have many problems in the expenditure of enterprise bonus funds.

"Special Car for Leaders"

Some enterprise cadres, in order to show off, rack their brains and, under the guise of purchasing "ambulances," "welfare vehicles," etc., trick the leading organs into approving the purchase of cars. The Mudanjiang Local Industry Bureau once wrote a report to the higher authorities, the gist of which was: "Most of the factories under our bureau are located in the suburbs, and transportation is inconvenient. In order to provide emergency medical care, we hereby request the purchase of an ambulance." However, after the car arrived, a notice was immediately issued: "For the convenience of leaders' travel, it is hereby stipulated..." From then on, the "ambulance" actually became a special car for leaders.

There are many such examples. For example, the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering bought two sleeper cars; the First Mechanical Installation Engineering Company, the Electrical Installation Engineering Company, and the Harbin Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau bought four motorcycles, all of which were paid for under the enterprise bonus fund.

Dividends in Proportion to Wages

Another form of abuse of enterprise bonuses is treating guests, holding banquets, watching operas, watching movies, going on picnics, and holding parties. For example, the Northeast First Engineering Company spent more than 4,000 yuan on a dinner for cadres above the section chief level. According to a survey by the Harbin Basic Construction System, expenditures of the above nature accounted for 80.6% of the total expenditure. Even more serious was the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau, which distributed 178,218 yuan of the enterprise bonus fund in the form of dividends. The method was to apportion it according to the proportion of wages, with cadres above 400 yuan receiving twice the amount. Therefore, the Party Committee Secretary, the Factory Director, and the Chairman of the Trade Union received the most.

"Omnipotent Fund"

Some units regard bonuses as an omnipotent fund, and all expenses that cannot be covered are paid from the enterprise bonus fund. The wages of the twenty-one people in the Welfare Section of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering are all paid from the enterprise bonus fund. The Harbin Soy Sauce Factory, with only about one hundred people, also bought an electric calculator. Some units use too much of the bonus for production, using almost all of the bonus fund as a production fund. The Qiqihar Flour Mill installed a motor, accounting for 60% of the annual enterprise bonus fund extracted. The Harbin Engineering Company, after buying a mixer, an electric oven, and a signal machine with the enterprise bonus fund, had very little left.

"Cultural Vacuum"

Some leading organs, under the guise of "adjustment," concentrate part of the fund in the higher-level organs. The lower levels have no right to dispose of it, and the higher levels use it improperly. The Harbin Local Industry Bureau stipulates that the use of enterprise bonus funds to provide relief to employees with difficulties must be approved by the Local Industry Bureau. However, many actual difficulties of the workers have not been resolved. The Provincial Department of Industry bought a hospital in Harbin, called the Local Industry Workers' Hospital. Because larger factories have clinics, this hospital cannot admit patients and loses money every month. Many people in the Harbin Sugar Factory are sick and urgently need to develop some health undertakings. The employee dormitories in some units are very crowded and have many bedbugs, but no one cares. Some small factories in Mudanjiang do not even have a club, but the Mudanjiang Industry Bureau used the bonus fund to build a cultural palace and bought a movie projector. Because most of the workers live in the suburbs, few people go to see it, and the workers call it a "cultural vacuum."

The above situation shows that these organs do not have a democratic management system and lack mass supervision in the use of enterprise bonus funds. As a result, some expenses that should not have used enterprise bonus funds have used the bonus funds; some, although they should have been used, have also been greatly wasted. According to Item 7 of the Provisional Regulations on the Use of Enterprise Bonus Funds issued by the former Central People's Government's Financial and Economic Committee, the enterprise bonus fund's usage plan and income and expenditure situation "should be reported regularly to the management committee or employee representative assembly of each factory or mine." The relevant units in Heilongjiang Province should strictly implement this regulation and correct the above deviations.

    黑龙江有些单位滥用企业奖金
    高学先
    每年，每一个实行经济核算制的企业单位，都根据国家规定，从计划利润和超计划利润中，拨出一定比例的企业奖励基金，用一部分来改善职工的物质文化生活。但是，黑龙江省有一些企业单位在企业奖励基金的支用上存在着不少问题。
    “首长专用车”
    有一些企业干部为了摆排场，便费尽心机，借着购买“救护车”“福利车”等等名义，骗取领导机关的批准，然后购置小汽车。牡丹江地方工业局曾向上级写了一个报告，大意是：“我局工厂大部位于市郊，交通不便，为了疾病救急，特呈请购买救护车一辆。”可是，汽车到手以后，马上发出通知：“为了首长乘车方便起见，特规定……”从此，“救护车”实际上成了首长专用车。
    这种例子很多。如建筑工程部东北第一工程公司买了卧车二辆；建筑局第一机械安装工程公司、电气安装工程公司、哈尔滨市工程公司买了摩托车四辆，都是在企业奖励基金项下开支的。
    按工资比例分红
    滥用企业奖金的另一种形式是请客、会餐、看戏、看电影、野游、联欢等。如东北第一工程公司请科长以上干部会餐，共支出四千多元。据哈尔滨市基本建设系统调查，属于上述性质的开支占到支出费用的80.6％。更严重的是有色金属管理局第一工程公司，把企业奖励基金以分红的形式分掉了十七万八千二百一十八元，办法是按工资的比例分摊，四百分以上的干部增加一倍，因此，党委书记、厂长、工会主席分得最多。
    “万　能　费”
    有一些单位把奖金当成万能费，凡是不能开支的款项都由企业奖励基金中支出。建筑工程部东北第一工程公司福利科二十一个人的工资，都由企业奖励基金中开支。哈尔滨酱油厂只有一百人左右，也买了一台电动计算器。有些单位把奖金用于生产的数字过大，把奖励基金几乎全部用作生产基金。齐齐哈尔制粉厂安电动机一台，占全年提取的企业奖励基金60％。哈尔滨市工程公司，把企业奖励基金买了搅拌机、电烘箱、信号机后，就所剩无几了。
      “文　化　空”
    有些领导机关以“调剂”为名，把部分基金集中在上一级机关里。下级无权支配，而上级使用不当。哈尔滨市地方工业局规定，用企业奖励基金救济有困难的职工，必须得到地方工业局批准。可是，工人中许多实际困难没有得到解决。省工业厅在哈尔滨市买了一处医院，叫做地方工业工人医院，由于较大工厂都有医务所，这个医院收不进病人，月月赔钱。哈尔滨糖厂患病的人很多，急需举办一些卫生事业，还有一些单位的职工宿舍住得很挤，臭虫很多，都无人过问。牡丹江有些小工厂连个俱乐部都没有，可是牡丹江工业局却用奖励基金修了一个文化宫，买了一架电影机，因为大部分工人住在郊外，去看的人很少，工人们都叫它是“文化空”。
    上述情况说明，这些机关在企业奖励基金的使用上，没有民主管理制度，缺乏群众监督。结果，有的不该使用企业奖励基金的开支，动用了奖励基金；有的虽然应该动用，但也浪费很大。根据前中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会提用企业奖励基金的临时规定第七项规定，关于企业奖励基金的使用计划、收支情况，“应定期向各该厂矿公司的管理委员会或职工代表大会报告。”黑龙江省各有关单位应该严格执行这个规定，纠正上述偏向。
