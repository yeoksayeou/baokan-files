Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th. Recently, the Weiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province dispatched staff to assist the Fenglong Agricultural Production Cooperative in correcting the tendency of blindly promoting production reforms and excessively increasing the labor intensity of cooperative members.

The labor of Fenglong cooperative members was excessively strained. According to investigations, from March to May this year, 20% to 50% of the male labor force worked overtime at night to tread waterwheels, carry wheat, and transport manure; at the end of April when harvesting wheat, 70% of the female cooperative members worked at night. Due to overwork, some male cooperative members fell asleep on the ridges of the fields while resting from transplanting rice seedlings, and some female cooperative members also fell asleep on the threshing ground while rubbing wheat.

The staff of the Weiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after investigating at the cooperative, believed that: the main reason for this phenomenon was that the cooperative's leadership deployed work divorced from the current actual situation, made excessively high demands in promoting agricultural technology, and was very blind. For example, the "square-grid seedling raising" of cotton was mainly to solve the contradiction that the previous crops in the field had not yet been harvested, but cotton had to be sown in advance. Of the 198 mu of cotton fields in this cooperative, 110 mu this year were originally vacant and could be directly sown. However, the cooperative implemented "square-grid seedling raising and transplanting" for all of them. In this way, the number of labor days required per mu increased ninefold compared to direct sowing. When planting rice, the method of planting "shovel seedlings" was also blindly promoted, wasting a lot of manpower and delaying the production season.

In order to correct this deviation, the cadres of the Weiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party helped the cadres of the Fenglong Cooperative to mobilize cooperative members to jointly study and revise the unrealistic agricultural and sideline production plan. For example, the original plan was to interplant sweet potatoes in 480 mu of cornfields. After harvesting one season of corn, another season of corn had to be rushed to plant. This was not only labor-intensive, but also uncertain about the yield of the second season of corn, and it also affected the growth of sweet potatoes. Now it has been decided not to plant a second season of corn, but to concentrate efforts on managing sweet potatoes, which will not only increase production but also save labor.

The cadres also mobilized cooperative members to study and improve some production tools to reduce labor intensity. For example, in the past, the entire cooperative had to send 26 cooperative members to the county seat to carry manure every day, which was tiring and inefficient. Now they plan to use carts to transport manure, which will not only reduce labor intensity but also save 270 labor days per month. Now, the entire cooperative has proposed the use of three types of improved tools, which can save a total of 4,000 labor days per month.

In order to correct the phenomenon of increasing the labor intensity of cooperative members, the cooperative also stipulated that overtime work should not be arranged at will. And cooperative members should be given a certain amount of time to arrange household production and housework.

After doing this, the cooperative members were very satisfied.

### 纠正推行生产改革的盲目性

    纠正推行生产改革的盲目性
    新华社成都18日电　最近，中共四川省威远县委员会派出工作人员，帮助奉龙农业生产合作社，纠正了盲目推行生产改革、过分增加社员劳动强度的偏向。
    奉龙社社员劳动过分紧张。据调查，这个社今年三月到五月，有20％到50％的男劳动力加班加点，在夜间车水、挑麦子、运粪；四月底收小麦时，有70％的女社员晚上出工。由于劳累过度，有的男社员在栽秧休息时就倒在田坎上睡着了，有些女社员在搓麦时也睡倒在晒场上。
    中共威远县委会的工作人员在这个社调查后认为：造成这种现象的主要原因，是这个社的领导上布置工作脱离当前的实际情况，在推广农业技术上要求偏高，盲目性很大。如棉花的“方格育苗”，主要是为了解决地里前作物未收，而又要提前播种棉花的矛盾。这个社的一九八亩棉田，今年就有一一零亩原是空地，可以直播。但是，这个社却全部实行“方格育苗移栽”，这样，每亩需工数就比直播增加了九倍。在栽种水稻时，也发生盲目推广栽“铲秧”的方法，浪费不少人力，延迟了生产季节。
    为了纠正这个偏向，中共威远县委员会干部帮助奉龙社干部，发动社员共同研究，修改了不切实际的农副业生产计划。如原来计划在四八零亩玉米地里间种甘薯，一季玉米收了，还要再抢种二季玉米。这样不但费工，二季玉米产量又无把握，而且影响甘薯生长。现在决定不种二季玉米，集中力量管理甘薯，这样，既能增产，又可节省劳力。
    干部们还发动社员研究改进一些生产工具，以减少劳动强度。如过去全社每天要派二十六个社员到县城挑粪，人累、效率不高。现在打算改用架子车运粪，不仅劳动强度可以减轻，每月还可节省二七零个劳动日。现在，全社提出采用三种改良工具，每月共可节约四千个劳动日。
    为纠正增加社员劳动强度的现象，社里还规定不得随意加班加点。并且要给社员一定的时间安排家庭生产和家务。
    这样做了以后，这个社的社员们很满意。
