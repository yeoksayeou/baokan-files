    Guizhou's First Wooden Inverted Siphon

  　Guizhou Province's first wooden inverted siphon, built in Jiangkou County, has recently been completed and put into operation. This inverted siphon, with a total length of 335.7 meters, can irrigate 2,841 mu of farmland. It was built using locally sourced wood, making the cost about two times lower than using steel pipes.

    贵州第一座木质倒虹吸管
  　修建在江口县境内的贵州省第一座木质倒虹吸管，已在最近竣工，并开始通水。这座全长335.7公尺的倒虹吸管可灌溉农田2，841亩。它是采取就地取材的方法，利用当地出产的木材修建的，造价要比钢管低两倍左右。　冯济源摄（新华社稿）
