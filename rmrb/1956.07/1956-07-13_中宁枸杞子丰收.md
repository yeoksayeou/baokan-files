    Zhongning Chinese wolfberries (a Chinese medicine and tonic) are being harvested in Zhongning County, Gansu Province, the largest production area of Chinese wolfberries in the country. This year, the entire county has achieved cooperativization. The field management of the lycium chinense trees that produce the wolfberries has been more meticulous than in previous years, so the wolfberries are heavy on the branches, large, and fleshy. It is estimated that the more than 6,980 mu of wolfberries in the county will increase production by fifteen jin per mu compared to last year.

    中宁枸杞子丰收
    本报银川电　全国最大的枸杞子（中药，滋补品）产地甘肃中宁县，枸杞子已到了收获季节。今年全县实现了合作化。对生长枸杞子的茨树的田间管理工作做得比往年细致，因此枸杞子结得枝头累累，颗大，肉厚。预计全县的6，980多亩枸杞子每亩可比去年增产十五斤。
