　　II. Initial Encounter with Light

　　When we were first liberated, because we didn't understand the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army well enough, we were apprehensive, thinking that with so many "soldiers" coming, we wouldn't be able to perform. But soon two comrades from the People's Liberation Army came to our troupe, asking us with concern what plays we were performing, how many people there were, how our lives were, and asking us to continue performing as usual. So we performed again. After performing for more than twenty days, we didn't see a single comrade from the People's Liberation Army come to watch the show for free, and we were all surprised: how could there be such a disciplined army! This was truly different from the Kuomintang army we used to see.

　　Everyone's political awareness gradually increased. We also gradually felt that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the social status of artists had indeed improved, and they were no longer looked down upon as before. But at this time, we had new worries: seeing that other opera genres were flourishing and growing stronger after liberation, while Kunqu opera, because most of its lyrics were relatively profound and difficult to understand, was not easily accepted by the masses, so we were very worried whether Kunqu opera could serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. At that time, the attendance rate was still very low, and everyone's life was still difficult. Some actors had to leave the troupe because their family life was really unsustainable. But other comrades still persisted. At this time, someone from Shanghai came to invite me to teach opera, and they could pay me a salary of one hundred and eighty yuan per month. I declined. Leaving the troupe could make my personal life more comfortable, but I couldn't abandon the brothers and sisters who had shared joys and sorrows with me in the past at a time of difficulty, and I couldn't give up the Kunqu opera career that I had persisted in for a long time and be a person who gave up halfway. In order to make our plays more directly educational to the audience, I tried to write a Kunsu opera "Glorious Family" to cooperate with the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. Every night, after the play was over and everyone had gone to bed, I would write the script under the flickering candlelight. I hadn't read many books, I was just writing based on my thirty years of experience in acting, needless to say, there were many difficulties in writing. After the script was written, we rehearsed it intensely, just preparing to perform it for the People's Liberation Army the next day, when suddenly someone from my family rushed to my house and said that my father had passed away and that I should go home immediately. This made me feel embarrassed. I should go back immediately to take care of the funeral after my father's death, but the task of performing made it difficult for me to get away. In the end, I decided to go back a few days later and perform for the People's Liberation Army first.

　　In 1952, our troupe participated in the Jiaxing Special District Opera Performance and received attention from the Zhejiang Provincial Cultural Bureau and the Jiaxing Special District. In 1953, our troupe was changed to a private-run, publicly-assisted one, and the government allocated two thousand yuan to make costumes for us. When we wore the new costumes for the first time, many comrades put on makeup and costumes one or two hours in advance, sitting face to face in the backstage. I asked them why? They said that after performing for half their lives, they had never worn such good costumes, and they wanted to sit a little longer today wearing new costumes. This was everyone's true feeling!

　　In 1954, we accepted a new task: in order to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the death of the great playwright Hong Sheng, the leadership wanted us to perform his "The Palace of Eternal Life" in twenty days. Although this play is a traditional famous play of Kunqu opera, we haven't performed it for many years, and most of the comrades have to re-learn the lines and tunes. In order to ensure the completion of the performance task, all the comrades wrote guarantees. In the hot weather of June, in addition to performing two plays as usual every day, everyone had to set aside all spare time to memorize lines and practice tunes. Some comrades put the script on the bedside and read it as soon as they opened their eyes in the morning. The intense labor made some comrades sick, but we finally completed the task and staged the Kunqu opera "The Palace of Eternal Life" on time.

      二、初次见光明
    刚解放的时候，因为我们对共产党和解放军还不够了解，所以心里也曾有过疑惧，以为又来了这许多“兵”，我们又要演不成戏了。但是不久就有两位解放军的同志到我们剧团来，关心地问我们演的是什么戏，有多少人，生活怎么样，要我们照常演戏。于是我们又演戏了。演了二十多天，却看不到一个解放军的同志来看白戏，我们都奇怪起来了：怎么会有这样纪律严明的军队！这真和我们以前常看到的国民党军队截然不同。
    大家的政治认识逐渐提高了。也逐渐感到在共产党领导下，艺人的社会地位的确提高了，不像从前那样受轻视了。但是这时候我们又产生了新的苦闷：看到其他剧种在解放后都欣欣向荣地发展、壮大，而昆曲却由于大部分唱词比较深奥难懂，不易为群众接受，所以我们很担心昆曲能不能为工农兵服务。当时上座率仍很低，大家的生活还是困难的。个别演员由于家庭生活实在无法维持，不得已离开了剧团。但其他同志还都坚持着。这时候上海有人来请我去教戏，每月能给我工资一百八十元。我谢绝了。离开剧团可以使我个人过较宽裕的生活，但是我不能在困难的时候撇掉过去同甘共苦的兄弟姐妹们，我更不能放弃长期坚持下来的昆曲事业，作一个半途而废的人。为了使我们的戏更能直接地给观众一些教育，于是我尝试编写一个配合抗美援朝的昆苏剧“光荣人家”。每天夜里，戏完了，大家睡下以后，我就在摇摇幌幌的蜡烛光下写剧本。我没有读过多少书，只是凭我三十多年演戏的经验来写作，不用说写作上困难是很多的。剧本写好后我们就紧张地排练，正预备第二天给解放军演出，突然我家中赶来了人，说我父亲亡故，要我立即回家。这使我左右为难，父亲逝世我应当立即回去料理丧事，但是演出的任务又使我难于脱身，我最后还是决定迟回去几天，先为解放军演出。
    1952年，我们剧团参加了嘉兴专区的戏曲会演，得到了浙江省文化局和嘉兴专区的重视。1953年，我们剧团改为民营公助，政府拨二千元钱给我们做服装。我们第一次穿上新服装的时候，很多同志都提前一、二小时就化好妆、穿好服装，在后台相对端坐。我问他们这是为什么？他们说，演了半辈子戏，还没穿过这样好的服装，今天要穿新服装多坐一会儿。这是大家的真心话啊！
    到了1954年，我们又接受了新的任务：为了纪念大剧作家洪升逝世二百五十周年，领导上要我们在二十天内排出他的“长生殿”。这个戏虽然是昆曲的传统名剧，但是我们已有很多年不演了，大部分同志都要重新学台词、学曲子。为了保证完成演出任务，全团同志写了保证书，在六月的大热天里，每天照常演两场戏之外，大家还要抽出一切空余时间来背台词、练曲子。有的同志把剧本放在床头，清晨一睁开眼睛就读。紧张的劳动，把有些同志累病了，但是我们终于完成了任务，准时上演了昆曲“长生殿”。
