Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 22nd dispatch: Not long ago, the People's Action Front, jointly formed by six Chilean political parties, held its first congress in Chile.

    Salvador Allende, leader of the People's Action Front, spoke at the congress. Allende pointed out that the People's Action Front advocates for the establishment of a political system in which all Chileans can participate and which can guarantee freedom and equality. He said that the Front will dedicate itself to eliminating the foundations of the feudal system that dominates the country, restoring the nation's control over its wealth, and striving for complete economic and political independence. Allende advocated for the establishment of a multi-party government that can represent the majority of the country.

    The congress passed a resolution on striving to unite the broad masses of working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 23rd dispatch: Social Democrats in Brazil have recently been criticizing the Brazilian government's subservience to American foreign policy.

    Vieira Melo, leader of the Social Democratic parliamentary group in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, pointed out in a recent speech that Brazil does not have a serious foreign policy that conforms to the course of events, and has essentially abandoned its function as a coordinator of South American political and economic interests. He said that the policy of self-isolation prevents Brazil from playing the role of defender of the interests of the entire continent at international conferences, and prevents Brazil from striving for just, sincere, and effective cooperation among Latin American countries and satisfying their demands.

    Oliveira Brito, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and a Social Democrat, published an article in the "Morning Post" advocating that Brazil implement a policy of reciprocity and equality towards the United States, the Soviet Union, and any other country. He emphasized that Brazil should restore relations with the Soviet Union.

    Senator Domingo Velasco, a Social Democrat, supported the position of many prominent political activists demanding a change in Brazil's foreign policy. He called for a realistic study of the international situation. He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now acting on instructions from the US State Department, which is detrimental to national interests.

    拉丁美洲国家要求独立的趋势增长
    智利人民行动阵线主张争取国家的完全独立
    巴西社会民主党批评政府屈从美国外交政策
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚22日讯：不久以前在智利举行了由六个智利政党联合组成的人民行动阵线的第一次大会。
    人民行动阵线领导人萨尔瓦多·阿伦德在大会上讲了话。阿伦德指出，人民行动阵线主张建立全体智利人可以参与的并且能够保证自由和平等的政治制度。他说，这个阵线将致力于消灭在国内占统治地位的封建制度的基础，恢复国家对自己财富的管理，争取完全的经济和政治独立。阿伦德主张建立可以代表全国大多数的多党政府。
    大会通过了关于争取团结广大劳动群众的决议。
    新华社23日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西的社会民主党人最近对巴西政府屈从美国的外交政策纷纷提出批评。
    巴西众议院社会民主党议会党团领袖维埃拉·梅洛不久以前发表的演说指出，巴西没有一个严正的、符合事件进程的外交政策，并且实质上已经放弃了作为南美政治经济利益方面的协调者的职能。他说，自我孤立的政策妨碍巴西在国际会议上起整个大陆利益捍卫者的作用，妨碍巴西争取拉丁美洲国家进行公正、真诚和有效合作以及满足它们的要求的斗争。
    巴西众议院司法委员会主席社会民主党人奥利维拉·勃里托在“晨邮报”上发表文章，主张巴西对美国、苏联以及其他任何国家都执行一种有来有往和平等的政策。他强调指出，巴西应当恢复同苏联的关系。
    参议员社会民主党人多明戈·维拉斯科支持要求改变巴西外交政策的许多著名政治活动家的立场。他要求现实地研究国际局势。他说，现在外交部是按美国国务院指示行动，这给国家利益带来了损害。
