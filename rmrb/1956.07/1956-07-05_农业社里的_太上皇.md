　　The "Emperor" in the Agricultural Cooperative
　　Lǐ Liánbīn

　　Something unpleasant happened in the Shatan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, in the spring of this year.

　　A person with an impatient look on his face was sternly rebuking a tall and amiable person:

　　"Where did you go last night?"

　　"I went to the team," the tall man replied.

　　"Couldn't bear to be away from your wife, eh!" Judging from his fierce tone, he was just like a feudal patriarch in the old society.

　　Who were they? The stern person was actually Hu Junjie, the cadre stationed in the cooperative; the tall person was Hu Shuigen, the second director of the Shatan Agricultural Cooperative.

　　The Party sent a large number of cadres into the rural areas to build a new socialist countryside and create a new life of happiness for the people. But Hu Junjie mistakenly thought that this was a good opportunity for him to throw his weight around. After he arrived at the Shatan Cooperative, he first set up a large organization. In a not-so-large agricultural cooperative, he established nine directors, twenty-six management committee members, four inspection directors, and eighteen inspection committee members. Adding in team leaders and group leaders, the cooperative had hundreds of cadres. He thought: A section of the County People's Committee has only four or five cadres; my agricultural cooperative has hundreds. He considered himself an incredible "chief." In order to better show off his authority, he ordered all the directors to work and eat together in a centralized manner. At that time, the second director, Hu Shuigen, and others opposed his practice (the first director, Mao Jubao, was away studying), and suggested to him: If the directors are brought together in this way, separated from the masses, how can they lead production well? He insisted on his own ideas. The directors had to carry their luggage and rice sacks to the management committee office for collective work and collective meals. Even a female director who had just given birth a month ago had to bring her child to the management committee office for collective work and collective meals under Hu Junjie's demand to "overcome difficulties."

　　The second director, Hu Shuigen, felt compelled to be tied to the office, not knowing anything about the situation below, and was very worried, always wanting to run to the teams. He knew that this was an action that violated Hu Junjie's "will," but he did it anyway. As a result, he received a rebuke.

　　Hu Junjie was intoxicated by this momentum of commanding hundreds of responses with a single call, not going to the production teams or the fields, but issuing orders every day based on reports and meetings. The agricultural cooperative management committee office looked very lively, with people coming and going in an endless stream; however, the problems could not be solved in a timely and thorough manner. The cooperative members were dissatisfied with the cooperative director, and the directors were also distressed by their situation.

　　Hu Junjie was not satisfied with this. He also thought: How good it would be to have a communicator who would run errands and deliver messages for him! Establishing a communicator in his own name was not appropriate; establishing a communicator in the name of the cooperative had no such provision. He racked his brains and finally came up with a way: The township people's committee used to have a communicator. Although there is no such position now, and there is no way to pay the communicator's salary, it can be done in the name of the township communicator, with the salary secretly paid by the cooperative, without letting the cooperative members know. In this way, no one would find it strange. In this way, he had a communicator. After Hu Junjie had a communicator, he then wanted a personal secretary. He knew that adding a secretary's name to the cooperative's personnel list would not be justified. So, he used a counter-revolutionary element under production control to help him "organize materials," with the cooperative paying for work points. In this way, the problem of a personal secretary was also solved.

　　Seeing this, perhaps the reader thinks that his work is too busy and he needs so many assistants. No, the masses summarized his activities as follows: from the management committee to the canteen, from the canteen to the post office. He spent his time every day going from the management committee—canteen—post office, post office—canteen—management committee. What did he do in the management committee? A large part of the time was spent turning on the radio to listen to music. Hu Junjie regarded the agricultural cooperative as inexhaustible wealth and himself as the "Emperor" of the agricultural cooperative, with unlimited power to control all wealth. The Shatan Cooperative did have a lot of wealth, with herds of cattle and tens of thousands of acres of fields. This was not wrong. What was wrong was that Hu Junjie regarded these assets as belonging to him personally.

　　He wanted to enjoy the cooperative's money, building offices, making hardwood desks, buying radios, bicycles... Although his "ideal" was not fully realized due to the opposition of the cooperative's backbone members, his life was indeed absurd enough. Sometimes he lit the cooperative's kerosene lamp to play mahjong with a few people who flattered him, playing until two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, and not getting up until after ten o'clock the next morning, washing his face, and then going to the canteen for lunch.

　　Once, Hu Shuigen couldn't bear his lifestyle and said to him: "Comrade Hu, the masses are going to gamble!" He said with great confidence: "Gambling is against the law!" Comrade Hu Shuigen asked in return: "Isn't it against the law for you to light the agricultural cooperative's kerosene lamp to play mahjong?" His face turned red from the roots of his ears to his chin, and he said angrily: "Don't feel bad about the gasoline, I will reimburse you in the future!" The mahjong game continued.

　　Once, Hu Junjie actually asked Hu Shuigen to arrange for one of his wife's brothers to work in the agricultural cooperative. He thought that Hu Shuigen would definitely arrange a "decent" job for his wife's brother, and would never ask his wife's brother to participate in labor production, so that he would lose "face." Unexpectedly, Comrade Hu Shuigen said: "What else can you do when you come to the cooperative, just participate in production!" At that time, Hu Junjie expressed dissatisfaction, thinking that this was an insult to him, and was so angry that he couldn't say anything.

　　Hu Shuigen's actions that made Hu Junjie unhappy had happened many times. Therefore, Hu Junjie regarded him as a thorn in his side and wanted to get rid of his position. When the county committee discovered the large organization he had created and ordered him to reduce its size, he thought he had seized a good opportunity to get rid of Hu Shuigen. He slandered and maligned Hu Shuigen, saying that Hu Shuigen had political and historical problems. But the eyes of the masses are bright, and they know who is good and who is bad. After seeing his vile and shameless face, the comrades of the county committee ordered him to leave the Shatan Agricultural Cooperative immediately and return to await handling.

　　The "Emperor's" dream was thus shattered.

### 农业社里的“太上皇”

    农业社里的“太上皇”
    李连斌
    今年春季的某一天，江西南昌县沙潭农业生产合作社发生了一件令人不愉快的事情。
    一个满脸笼罩着不耐烦神气的人，声色俱厉地在申斥一个身材高大而和蔼可亲的人：
    “你昨天夜晚到那里去了？”
    “我到队里去了。”高个子回答。
    “离不开老婆吧！”从他狠狠的说话的神情看来，就像旧社会里的封建家长一模一样。
    他们是谁呢？那个声色俱厉的人，原来是驻社干部胡俊杰；身材高大的人，就是沙潭农业社的第二主任胡水根。
    党派出大批干部投入农村阵地，是为了建设社会主义的新农村，创造人民幸福的新生活。可是胡俊杰却错误地认为这是他个人作威作福的好时机。他到达沙潭社以后，首先安下一个大摊子。在一个不很大的农业社里设了九个主任，二十六个管委会委员，四个监察主任，十八个监察委员，加上队长组长等，社的干部上百。他想：县人民委员会的一个科不过四、五个干部；我一个农业社的干部就以百计。自以为是一个了不起的“首长”了。为了更好地抖威风，他命令所有的主任都要集中办公和集中吃饭。当时，第二主任胡水根等反对他这种作法（第一主任毛菊保离职学习），向他提出：把主任们这样集中起来，脱离了群众，怎么能领导好生产呢？他坚持自己的主张。主任们不得不扛着行李，背着米袋来管委会办公室集体办公和集体吃饭了，就连一个生小孩刚满月的女主任也在胡俊杰“克服困难”的要求下，也不得不抱着孩子来管委会的办公室集体办公，集体吃饭。
    第二主任胡水根觉得被迫地拴在办公室里，对下边情况一点不了解，很不放心，总想到各队跑一跑。他自己知道这是违背胡俊杰的“意志”的行动，但他还是作了。结果，受到了一场申斥。
    胡俊杰迷醉于这种一呼百应、威风凛凛的气势，既不到生产队去，也不到田间去，天天靠汇报和会议发号施令。农业社管委会的办公室，看起来很热闹，人来人往络绎不绝；可是，问题却不能及时而彻底地解决。社员们不满意社主任，主任们也都为自己这种处境而苦闷。
    胡俊杰并不以此为满足，他还想：能有一个给他跑前跑后，送信传令的通信员有多好呢！以私人名义设通信员吧，自己不够条件；用社的名义设通信员吧，没有这样的规定。他挖空心思，到底还是想出一个办法来：乡人民委员会过去曾有过通信员，现在虽没有这个编制，无从支付通信员的工薪，但可以用乡通信员的名义，工薪由社秘密支付，不让社员知道。这样，谁也不会觉得奇怪。就这样，他就有了通信员。胡俊杰有了通信员以后，接着又想有一个私人秘书，他知道，在社的人员名单上添上一个秘书的名字，无论如何是说不过去的，于是，用了一个被管制生产的反革命分子帮助他“整理材料”，由社里支付工分。就这样，私人秘书的问题也解决了。
    看到这里，也许读者以为他的工作太忙了，需要这样多的助手。不是的，群众总结他的活动规律是这样的：从管委会到食堂，从食堂到邮局。他每天就是管委会—食堂—邮局，邮局—食堂—管委会，把时间消耗过去了。在管委会做什么？很大一部分时间是开开收音机听音乐。胡俊杰把农业社看成是吃不完、用不绝的万贯家财，把自己看作农业社的“太上皇”，有无限的权力支配一切财富。沙潭社的确有万贯家财，牛成群，田上万，这一点并没有错，错就在于胡俊杰把这些财富看作是属于他个人的，
    想用合作社的钱好好地享受一下，修建办公室，做硬木办公桌，买收音机、脚踏车……。他的“理想”虽然由于社内骨干分子的反对未能完全实现，但生活也的确够荒唐的了。他有时点起农业社的汽灯同几个奉承他的人打麻将，一打打到半夜两三点钟，第二天到中午十点多钟才起床，洗洗脸，就到食堂吃午饭去了。
    有一次，胡水根对他这种生活实在看不下去了，就对他说：“胡同志，群众要聚赌哟！”他理直气壮地说：“聚赌是犯法的！”胡水根同志反问一句：“你点农业社的汽灯打麻将就不犯法吗？”他脸从耳根红到下巴，很气愤地说：“不要心痛汽油，我将来替你们报销！”麻将还是继续打了下去。
    有一次，胡俊杰居然叫胡水根把他的一个舅子安置在农业社里工作。他满以为胡水根一定会给他舅子安置一个“体面”的工作，决不会叫他舅子参加劳动生产，而使他失掉“体面”。不料胡水根同志说：“到社里来还能干甚么，就是参加生产吧！”当时胡俊杰就表示不满意，以为这对他是一种污辱，气得什么也说不出来了。
    胡水根同志使胡俊杰不愉快的事情还曾发生过好多次。因此，胡俊杰把他看成了眼中钉，想把他的职务搞掉。当县委会发现了他一手造成的这个大摊子，责令他缩小的时候，他以为抓到了搞掉胡水根的良机。他对胡水根进行污蔑和中伤，说胡水根有政治历史问题。但是群众的眼睛是亮的，知道谁好谁坏。县委会的同志们看清他卑鄙无耻的嘴脸后，便命令他立即离开沙潭农业社，回去听候处理。
    这位“太上皇”的美梦就这样破灭了。
