Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11th: The joint cotton bollworm prevention area of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces on both sides of the Yangtze River began spraying the cotton fields with 223 emulsion using aircraft today to eliminate cotton bollworms.

This morning, a grass-green "An-2" aircraft flew over a patch of verdant cotton fields in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, facing the rising sun. It sprayed a large amount of 223 emulsion on the cotton seedlings that were generally budding, at a rate of 500 mu of cotton fields every two and a half minutes. Another aircraft is currently conducting topographical and cotton field distribution surveys in the cotton-growing area of Susong County, Anhui Province, in preparation for spraying.

The area around Huangmei County in Hubei Province, Susong County in Anhui Province, and Pengze County in Jiangxi Province is one of the famous cotton-growing areas along the Yangtze River. In the past, cotton production in this area was often reduced by 20% to 30% due to the severe damage caused by cotton bollworms. To this end, the joint prevention area for cotton bollworms in Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces was established this year. According to reports from the eighteen pest situation prediction and forecasting points in the joint prevention cotton area, the cotton fields in this area have been growing well recently, but the first generation of cotton bollworms is generally occurring, and some have already begun to enter the flower buds. Therefore, the agricultural departments have decided to use aircraft to universally spray pesticides in order to completely eradicate them.

    湖北·安徽·江西用飞机除治红铃虫
    新华社武汉11日电　长江两岸湖北、安徽、江西三省棉花红铃虫联防区，今天开始用飞机喷洒除红铃虫的二二三乳剂。
    今天早晨，一架草绿色的“安二”型飞机，迎着朝阳飞到湖北省黄梅县一片碧绿的棉田上空。它以每两分半钟喷洒五百亩棉田的速度，把大量的二二三乳剂喷洒在普遍现蕾的棉苗上。另一架飞机现在正在安徽省宿松县棉区，作地形和棉田分布情况的勘察飞行，准备喷洒。
    湖北省黄梅县、安徽省宿松县和江西省彭泽县一带，是长江沿岸著名棉区之一。过去这一带的棉花，由于红铃虫危害严重，经常要减产两成到三成。为此，今年这里成立了鄂皖赣三省棉花红铃虫联防区。据联防棉区十八个虫情预测预报点报告，最近这一带棉区生长良好，但第一代红铃虫正在普遍发生，有的已经开始进入花蕾。于是，农业部门决定用飞机普遍喷洒药剂，以求彻底扑灭。
