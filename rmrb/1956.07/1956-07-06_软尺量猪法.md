    Soft Ruler Pig Measurement Method
    Yangshu Village
    The "soft ruler pig measurement to determine weight" experience created by Zhang Shaochun, a purchasing worker at the Lingui County Food Company in Guangxi Province, has basically solved the long-standing problem of accurately determining how much meat each pig has at the time of live pig acquisition. Since Lingui County implemented this method, the accuracy of measuring the meat yield of live pigs has reached 99%, and the time for completing the transaction of a pig has been shortened from several hours in the past to more than ten minutes. Local farmers praised it as an "excellent" method. The phenomenon of selling pigs that are overly full has been greatly reduced, and the operating loss rate of the food company has decreased from 15.77% to 2.29%.
    "Soft ruler pig measurement to determine weight" is a simple and easy method, which is a relatively scientific method developed on the basis of the folk method of estimating meat weight by hand measuring pigs. First, measure the body length and chest circumference of different breeds and grades of pigs before slaughtering. After slaughtering, count the meat weight of each pig. Accumulate data through multiple slaughterings, and then analyze the meat yield of pigs with different body lengths and chest circumferences. Find the law of the normal ratio between body length and chest circumference and meat yield, and compile a comparison table. According to this normal ratio, the body length and chest circumference of the pig measured on the acquisition site can be used to check the comparison table and determine how much meat it has on the spot. Because the breeds of pigs are different in different regions, the prerequisite for using this method is to understand the law of the normal ratio between the body length and chest circumference and the meat yield of different breeds of pigs. This law can generally be found out by slaughtering three to five hundred pigs.
    When measuring pigs on site, the tools used only need a cloth ruler (standard market ruler) and a bottomless wooden cage. Let the pig stand naturally in the wooden cage, measure the body length from the midpoint of the line extending from the root of the ear to the root of the tail. The cloth ruler should be flat against the pig's body and not straightened. Wrap the cloth ruler tightly around the chest circumference from the inside of the forefoot and over the spine, and it should also be close to the pig's body. The pig's posture must be upright on all four feet, with the head neither raised nor lowered, otherwise it will affect the accuracy of the measurement. It only takes a few days to master this set of operating methods, which is much easier and faster to learn than the estimation method of looking at and touching with your hands.
    The creation of this experience plays an important role in promoting the reform of the method of correctly identifying meat weight in the acquisition of live pigs and implementing the policy of high quality and high price, and is welcomed by pig farmers. At present, the food company system is conducting trials in important pig-producing areas in Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces, and is preparing to promote it nationwide next year.

    软尺量猪法
    杨树村
    广西省临桂县食品公司收购工人张少春创造的“软尺量猪测定体重”的经验，基本上解决了在收购生猪的时候，长期没有解决的当场正确测定每头猪有多少肉的问题。临桂县推行这个方法以来，测定生猪出肉量的准确性达到99％，成交一头猪的时间从过去的几小时缩短到十几分钟。当地农民称赞这是一个“顶呱呱”的方法。卖饱食大肚猪的现象大大减少了，食品公司的经营损耗率从15.77％降低到2.29％。
    “软尺量猪测定体重”是一个简便易行的方法，它是在民间用手量猪估计肉重的基础上发展起来的比较科学的一个方法。先在宰猪前量计不同猪种、不同等级的猪的身长和胸围，宰后逐头统计它的肉重，通过多次屠宰积累资料，然后分析不同身长和胸围的猪的出肉量，找出身长和胸围同出肉量之间正常比例的规律，并编成对照表。根据这个正常比例，就可以在收购现场拿量计猪的身长和胸围的结果，查对照表，当场判断它有多少肉。因为各地的猪种不同，采用这个方法的先决条件是要摸清不同品种的猪身长和胸围同出肉量之间的正常比例的规律。这个规律一般试宰三、五百头就能够找出来。
    现场量猪的时候，用的工具只需一根布尺（标准市尺）和一个无底木笼。让猪自然站立在木笼内，从耳根沿伸线的中点量到尾根是身长，布尺要平贴猪身不能拉直；将布尺由前脚内侧紧绕过脊量胸围，也要紧挨猪身。猪站的姿势一定要四脚直立，头不抬高和低垂，否则就会影响量计的准确性。掌握这套操作方法只需要几天，比起用眼看、手摸的估肉方法，学起来要容易得多、快得多。
    这个经验的创造，对推动收购生猪正确鉴定肉重方法的改革，贯彻执行优质优价政策有重要作用，并为卖猪农民所欢迎。目前食品公司系统正在湖南、安徽、湖北、河北、河南、江西、广东等省的重要产猪区试验，准备明年在全国范围内推行。
