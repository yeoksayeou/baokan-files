At the beginning of this year, we often read news in the newspapers like this: such-and-such factory or such-and-such construction site, so many percent of the teams have formulated team plans, aiming to break the quota by so many percent. This, of course, is a gratifying thing. However, since then, it seems that there have been very few reports about employee team plans. Have most of them been realized, or have most of them not been realized? It is very concerning. Because even though each team formulates its own plan, and it is an advanced plan, if we do not strive to realize this plan, and organize every team's daily activities into the struggle to complete and overfulfill the state plan, then the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan will lose its most reliable guarantee.

Reading today's report in this newspaper about the Party Committee of the Second Company of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation of the CPC timely helping and organizing employees to realize team plans, I couldn't help but feel something: Look! Even if more than 90% of employees have made plans, we cannot rest easy and leave them alone. Taking the plans as an example, some have advanced indicators and specific measures, so the problems are not big; some have advanced indicators but lack specific measures, so the masses are enthusiastic but have few methods; and some have empty content and very few measures, so the problems are very big. The Party organization of this unit, based on these specific situations, organized forces to conduct in-depth inspections and provide specific assistance, which changed the state where most teams could not realize their plans and the advanced producer movement was stagnating.

I hope that all enterprises will check the implementation of team plans. If the plans have been realized, of course it is very good. We can summarize some experiences, consolidate them, and promote these experiences to other teams. If the plans have not been realized, we might as well analyze the reasons: see if the indicators are too high. If they are indeed too high, we can appropriately revise them; listen to the opinions of the workers, what difficulties they have, what help they need, and earnestly provide solutions.

The current advanced producer movement has reached a point where more specific work is needed. Do not just think that the problem is not big just because so many percent of the teams have made plans; only by truly going deep down and providing specific assistance can we make team plans truly effective.

专栏：

    今年年初，常常在报纸上读到这样的新闻：某某工厂或者某某工地，有百分之多少的小组制定了小组规划，要突破定额百分之多少。这，当然是令人高兴的事情。不过，从此以后，似乎很少再看到有关职工小组规划的报道，是大部分都实现了，还是大部分都没有实现？很让人关心。因为每一个小组虽然都制定自己的规划，而且是先进的规划，如果不去努力实现这个规划，把每一个小组的日常活动都组织到完成和超额完成国家计划的斗争中去，那末，完成和超额完成国家计划就失去了最可靠的保证。
    读了今天本报关于中共鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司第二公司党委会及时帮助和组织职工实现小组规划的报道，不由得心有所感：看！即便是90％以上的职工都订了规划，也不可高枕无忧，放开不管。拿规划来说，虽有指标既先进、措施又具体、因而问题不大的；也有指标虽先进、措施不具体、因而群众情绪高、办法少的；还有内容既空洞、措施又很少、因而问题很大的。这个单位的党组织根据这些具体情况，组织力量深入检查，具体帮助，才改变了大部分小组不能实现规划、先进生产者运动停滞不前的状态。
    希望各个企业都检查一下小组规划实现的情况。要是规划实现了，当然很好，可以总结些经验，巩固下去，并且把这些经验推广到别的小组去。要是规划没有实现，不妨分析分析原因：看看指标是不是高了，确实高了，可以适当修正；听听工人们提的意见，有些什么困难，需要哪些帮助，认真给予解决。
    现在的先进生产者运动是到了需要多做些具体工作的时候了。不要只看百分之多少的小组都订了规划，就以为问题不大；只有真正深入下去，具体帮助，才能使小组规划确收实效。
