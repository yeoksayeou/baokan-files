Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: China's first set of long-distance automatic equipment designed and manufactured independently was exhibited in Beijing yesterday, receiving visits from responsible persons of relevant departments and Soviet experts. It will be installed and used in a substation in Beijing within this month.

This equipment was researched and designed by the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and manufactured by the Beijing Electric Power Bureau. It includes control, signal, and measurement functions. The research work began at the end of last year, the design was completed at the end of April this year, and it was manufactured at the end of May. The main components and most of the other parts are manufactured in China.

During tests in Changchun and Beijing, where the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering is located, the equipment performed 12,000 actions (equivalent to several years of actual use) without errors, proving that its functions are excellent.

According to Wang Chuanshan, the 29-year-old scientific researcher and leader of the long-distance automation research group at the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, long-distance automation is a discipline that has developed in the last 20 years or so. In countries such as the Soviet Union and the United States, this new technology has been widely used in power, petroleum, mining, irrigation, and other sectors, but China has not yet adopted it. Short-distance automation devices can only be operated within a very short distance (generally within half a kilometer), while long-distance automation devices can be operated over distances of several kilometers or even thousands of kilometers.

Long-distance automatic technology includes four functions: control, signaling, measurement, and adjustment. It can connect the various departments of large enterprises distributed over a wide area and far apart from each other into a whole, coordinate the production process, expand the degree of automation, and improve labor productivity. Taking the power system as an example, the Soviet Union has adopted this technology and has already unmanned hydroelectric power stations that are operated from 2,000 kilometers away. It not only has the advantages of improving labor productivity, economy, safety, and saving manpower, but also some scientific and technological problems cannot be solved without long-distance automatic technology. For example, unmanned aircraft must have such a device to operate.

### 我国制成一套远距离自动装置

    我国制成一套远距离自动装置
    据新华社15日讯　中国自己设计制造的第一套远距离自动装置昨天在北京展出，接待有关部门负责人和中苏专家参观。这个月内它就要被安装在北京某变电站里使用。
    这套装置是中国科学院机械电机研究所研究设计、北京电业局制造的，它包括控制、信号、测量三个内容。研究工作从去年年底开始，今年四月底设计完毕，五月底做成。主要的元件和大部分另件都是我国自己制造的。
    在机械电机研究所所在地长春和北京试验时，这套设备曾经进行了一万二千次动作（相当于实际运用数年的动作），没有发生差错，证明它的功能是很好的。
    据领导这项研究设计工作的机械电机研究所远距离自动学研究组组长、二十九岁的科学研究人员王传善谈，远距离自动学是最近二十年左右发展起来的一门学科。在苏联、美国等国家这种新技术已经比较普遍地运用在动力、石油和采矿工业、灌溉等部门，但中国还没有采用。近距离自动化装置只能在很近的距离（一般是半公里以内）内进行操纵，远距离自动化装置可在数公里以至数千公里外操纵。
    远距离自动技术包括控制、信号、测量、调整四种功能，它可以使分布在广大空间、彼此相距极远的大企业的各部门联结为一个整体，使生产过程获得协调，扩大自动化程度和提高劳动生产率；以电力系统为例，苏联采用了这种技术以后，已经出现了在二千公里外操纵的无人水电站。它不但有提高劳动生产率、经济、安全和节省人力等优点，而且有些科学技术问题如果没有远距离自动技术根本不能解决，如无人飞机，就必须要有这种装置来操纵。
