    Renting Small Cars
    Zheng Xia
    Hu Shu, a cadre from the Broadcasting Bureau, recently had a healthy baby boy. He loved this son, who weighed over nine pounds at birth, immensely. He would tell everyone about it, and at the end, he would always add, "That day, my wife was lucky to have taken a rented car, otherwise, who knows what would have happened in the middle of the night!"
    The story goes like this: One day, it was already 11 p.m., and his wife, who was nine months pregnant, suddenly felt a pain in her stomach. Although the doctor said the due date was still more than half a month away, who could predict it so accurately! They had to go to the hospital immediately. But how to get there? It was twenty miles to the hospital, it was late at night, and they were outside the city. Where could they find a car? The couple panicked and didn't know what to do.
    He called a comrade in his office to ask if there was any way. As soon as that comrade heard, he immediately said, "Now there are rental cars in the city, which is very convenient. You can make a phone call, and the car will come!" He dialed the number with some doubt. After the Capital Automobile Company asked for his address and name, they said, "The car will be there in about ten minutes."
    Fifteen minutes later, the car actually arrived.
    Seeing that they were about to reach the hospital, his wife was in so much pain that she could hardly bear it. In a weak voice, she said, "I'm afraid I'm going to give birth in the car." The driver comforted her, "We'll be there soon. If we really can't make it, it doesn't matter if you give birth in the car." As he spoke, they arrived. The driver got out of the car, opened the hospital gate, helped carry the pregnant woman into the delivery room, and enthusiastically helped Hu Shu with the procedures.
    The child was born smoothly.
    He took the car back. This round trip was forty miles, but it only cost him five yuan and thirty cents in fares.
    Such things are not just one or two. Now people often see those rental cars with white license plates and red characters on the streets. They pick up and drop off patients at hospital entrances; transport passengers at train stations; take cadres to meetings; pick up children from nurseries to go home... They have solved so many difficulties and brought so much convenience to people!

    出租小汽车
    郑夏
    广播事业局的干部胡曙，新近得了个胖儿子。他对这个生下来就九磅多的儿子喜爱得不得了，见人就说，说到末了，总要加这么一句：“生的那天，我爱人多亏坐了出租小汽车，不然，深更半夜，谁晓得会发生什么事！”
    事情是这样的：那一天，已经深夜十一点了，他的怀孕九个月的爱人，肚子突然痛起来，虽然医生说预产期还有半个多月，但谁能算得那么准呢！得马上进医院。但怎么去？距医院有二十里路，既是深夜，又在城外，到那儿去找车呢？两口子想到这里，手忙脚乱起来，不知如何是好。
    他给机关的一个同志打电话问有没有法儿。那个同志一听马上说：“现在市里有了出租汽车，很方便，你打个电话，车子就去了！”他半信半疑地拨通了电话，首都汽车公司问清了住址和姓名以后说：“车子十几分钟就到。”
    一刻钟后，车子果真来了。
    眼看就到医院了，他爱人痛得有些支持不住，用微弱的声音说：“我恐怕要生到车上了。”司机安慰她：“马上就到了。假如实在到不了，就生在车上也没关系。”说着说着就到了。司机跑下车去，把医院大门打开，又帮着把产妇抬进产房，还热心地帮助胡曙去办手续。
    孩子顺利地出生了。
    他又坐着汽车回来。这一来回，足足有四十里，可一共才花了五块三毛钱的车费。
    这样的事，不是一件两件，现在人们在大街上，常常看到那带着白牌红字的出租小汽车。它在医院门口接送病人；在火车站上载运旅客；送干部开会；从托儿所接孩子回家……它给人们解决了多少困难，带来了多少方便啊！
