    A Bureau Chief's One Sentence Causes a Loss of 100,000 Yuan
    The Zhoucun Silk Factory in Shandong Province sells approximately 100,000 jin of silkworm pupae to farmers as fertilizer every year for one fen per jin. In May of this year, the Jinan Municipal State-owned Brewery, in order to expand its source of raw materials for soy sauce and save grain for the country, used silkworm pupae to trial-produce 150 bottles of soy sauce. They were immediately snapped up by consumers. Consumers unanimously praised the taste of the silkworm pupae soy sauce as being even better than the factory's "Wind Sail" brand soy sauce made from bean cake, with higher concentration and nutritional value, and a cost of four fen less per jin.
    Before the large-scale marketing of silkworm pupae this year, comrades from the Food Department and Supply and Marketing Department of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, the Jinan Municipal Bureau of Light Industry, the Silk Factory, and the Brewery, held a special meeting to study the issue of using silkworm pupae to make soy sauce. Everyone believed that the experience of using silkworm pupae to make soy sauce should be vigorously promoted, and that the silkworm pupae from the Zhoucun Silk Factory should be fully utilized. According to preliminary calculations, 100,000 jin of silkworm pupae can be used to produce 800,000 jin of high-quality and inexpensive soy sauce. This can save 460,000 jin of bean cake, the value of which as fertilizer is much higher than 100,000 jin of silkworm pupae.
    However, Gao Ziyan, the Director of the Jinan Municipal Bureau of Light Industry, opposed using silkworm pupae to make soy sauce. He stubbornly and subjectively insisted that the quality of this soy sauce was not good. The leading comrades of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry also accommodated Director Gao's conservative thinking and, for fear of the silkworm pupae going moldy, decided to sell them all to farmers as fertilizer at a price of one fen per jin. Originally, 100,000 jin of silkworm pupae could be made into soy sauce and sold for 120,000 yuan, but as fertilizer, they could only be sold for 1,000 yuan. From this point of view, the state lost more than 110,000 yuan.
    Now, Director Gao has not changed his mind about refusing to use silkworm pupae to make soy sauce, and the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry has no intention of criticizing Director Gao's conservative thinking. However, I feel that a loss of more than 100,000 yuan is already distressing enough, and similar things should not be allowed to happen again.　Xu Jiwen

### 局长一句话，损失十万元

    局长一句话，损失十万元
    山东省有个周村制丝厂，每年有10万斤左右蚕蛹以一分钱一斤卖给农民作肥料。济南市地方国营酿造厂为了开辟酱油的原料来源，给国家节省粮食，在今年五月间利用蚕蛹试造150瓶酱油，一会儿功夫就被消费者购买一空。消费者一致称赞蚕蛹酱油的味道比该厂用豆饼制的风船牌酱油还要好，浓度、营养价值也比风船牌的高，每一斤的成本还要低四分钱。
    今年蚕蛹大量上市以前，山东省工业厅的食品处、供销处、济南市轻工业局、制丝厂、酿造厂等单位的同志，专门开会研究用蚕蛹制酱油的问题，大家认为应当大力推广蚕蛹制酱油的经验，充分利用周村制丝厂的蚕蛹。据初步计算，用10万斤蚕蛹可以制造80万斤又好又便宜的酱油。可以节约46万斤豆饼，这些豆饼作肥料比10万斤蚕蛹的价值高得多。
    但是，济南市轻工业局高子岩局长却反对用蚕蛹制造酱油，他主观地硬说这种酱油质量不好。山东省工业厅的领导同志也迁就高局长的保守思想，为了怕蚕蛹发霉，决定以一分钱一斤的价钱统统卖给农民作肥料。本来10万斤蚕蛹制成酱油可以卖十二万元，作肥料只能卖一千元。从这一点来说，国家就损失了十一万多元。
    现在，高局长还没有改变拒绝用蚕蛹制酱油的主意，山东省工业厅也没有打算批判高局长的保守思想的意思。可是，我觉得损失了十多万元已经够令人痛心了，不应该让类似的事再发生了。　徐纪文
