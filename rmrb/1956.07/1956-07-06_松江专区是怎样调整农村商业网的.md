    Songjiang Special District surrounds Shanghai. Commerce is developed here, and transportation is convenient. The entire district has 324 market towns of various sizes. The large market towns are relatively evenly distributed, with stores in various industries providing for the production and living needs of farmers. Many small market towns are densely distributed around the large market towns. The shops here are mainly husband-and-wife stores, selling small commodities needed by farmers. After agricultural cooperation, farmers go to the towns much less frequently. They long for "a shop in the countryside so that children can also buy things, which can save labor."

    This change in the supply and marketing relationship in the rural market urgently requires the extension of the rural commercial network. According to the principle of "facilitating mass purchase and sales, being conducive to commodity circulation, and conforming to economic accounting," the Songjiang Special District reorganized the original commercial network reasonably. At present, there are 384 rural supply points extended throughout the district, with a total of 1,062 employees. According to a preliminary inspection of 208 points, the income of most employees has increased, and their business confidence is very high.

    The service range of each employee in a rural supply point should generally be about 100 to 150 households. Supply points should be located in convenient locations with which the masses are familiar. Basically, every township should have a point.

    The variety of goods managed by supply points is determined according to the principle of "complete in market towns, convenient in the countryside." At present, there are generally forty or fifty kinds of commodities, divided into four categories: daily necessities, daily sundries, commodities needed temporarily, and seasonal commodities. The focus is on managing daily necessities. According to statistics from the Fengjing District, the sales of daily necessities account for 89% of the total business volume of the supply points.

    There are various organizational forms of supply points. One is a cooperative group of joint purchase and separate sales (including husband-and-wife stores and small traders), accounting for 67%; another is employees from joint state-private ownership and cooperative stores, accounting for 23%; and another is the supply and marketing cooperative directly sending people down, accounting for 10%. Judging from the current effects, the cooperative group form is most suitable for the supply and marketing characteristics of the rural market and can give play to the enthusiasm of small rural traders.

    The personnel participating in the supply point work are roughly divided into three types: one is small traders who originally roamed the countryside or retailed in fixed locations in the countryside, who are fixed or organized; one is that the business volume of town stores has decreased due to the extension of the commercial network, and relevant industries are organized to send corresponding employees down according to the reduced ratio; and another is organizing employees from industries that are too numerous in the towns to go down. The personnel sent down should have certain business abilities, be familiar with the regional situation, and have certain labor conditions.

    The business operations of rural supply points generally adopt the method of "combining fixed and mobile, combining delivery and pre-purchase, and combining supply and purchase." At present, except for those with only one employee, most supply points handle mobile reservation and delivery services; some county supply points have also launched purchasing services. The business scope must be demarcated for mobile reservation and delivery to avoid competition and mutual offsetting of forces. The technicality of purchasing business is relatively large, and it is operated exclusively by peddlers in general areas, and concurrently by supply points in areas with inconvenient transportation or water networks. For commodities not managed by rural supply points, the towns organize delivery teams to go to the countryside. Rural supply points also carry goods to the towns for the masses free of charge, and professional stores give handling fees.

    Rural supply points are widespread and large in quantity, and they have an inseparable connection with the economic life of farmers. In terms of business leadership, the supply and marketing cooperatives should divide the work according to their subordinate institutions and adopt the method of dividing areas for leadership. In order to ensure that it serves the masses better, the Party branch of the nearby advanced agricultural production cooperative should strengthen political supervision and leadership over the supply points.

    After the extension of the commercial network, the business volume of the towns will inevitably be affected to a certain extent. However, according to the current situation in Songjiang Special District, the towns still play a core role in rural commodity circulation. This is mainly because the varieties of goods managed by the supply points only account for about 15% to 20% of the purchasing power of the masses; and the towns themselves still bear the direct supply tasks for residents and some farmers. For example, Fengjing Town bears the direct supply task for 14,694 people, accounting for 24% of the total population of the district. After the extension of the commercial network, it is estimated that the retail sales in 1956 still account for 68% of the total retail sales of the district, a decrease of 7% compared with last year. Some industries are currently impossible to extend, such as cotton cloth, bamboo and wood, hardware, ceramics, etc., which the masses need regularly and have larger selection needs, and other industries that manage high-end commodities. These industries bear the supply tasks within the entire economic scope, and will not only not be affected by the extension of the commercial network, but also their business volume will continue to rise with the improvement of people's living standards.

    In addition to the retail network, the commercial network in the towns also includes procurement and wholesale networks, which are distribution centers for small traders and farmers, and are generally conveniently located for transportation with many merchants. According to statistics from Zhangnian Town, Jinshan County, merchants and boatmen account for about 20% of the members of the market, and they themselves also bring a part of the purchasing power and consumption. These situations show that the extension of the commercial network in the towns has a certain limit. In the future, with the improvement of the purchasing power of the masses and the establishment of the labor system of agricultural production cooperatives, the business will be further developed and expanded. Therefore, while organizing the extension of the commercial network, it is necessary to correctly arrange the division of labor between the commercial network in the towns and the countryside. The experience of Songjiang Special District in adjusting the commercial network also shows that the commercial network is basically centered on the retail network, but the catering, service, procurement, wholesale network and retail network have interdependent relationships. Therefore, when carrying out the adjustment of the commercial network, it is also necessary to consider whether the allocation of commercial networks in various industries is reasonable. In addition, the livestock trading market and handicraft repair should be planned together and adjusted in batches in a step-by-step manner; local industrial processing plants, credit cooperatives, medical institutions, postal and telecommunications, public utilities, etc. should also be properly arranged comprehensively with the gradual adjustment of the commercial network.

    松江专区是怎样调整农村商业网的
    朱羊
    环绕上海周围的是松江专区。这里商业发达，交通便利。全区共有大小集镇324个，大集镇分布比较均衡，各行各业设有门市部，供应农民生产、生活各方面的需要。大集镇周围密布许多小集镇，这里的商店主要是夫妻店，售卖农民需要的小百货。农业合作化以后，农民上镇次数大大减少了，他们渴望“乡下有个店，小囡也能买东西，可以节省劳动力”。
    农村市场供销关系的这种变化，迫切要求农村商业网下伸。松江专区根据“便利群众购销、有利于商品流转、符合经济核算”的原则，把原有的商业网进行了合理的改组。目前，全区下伸的农村供应点共有384个，从业人员共1，062人。据208个点的初步检查，大多数从业人员的收入都增加了，经营信心很高。
    农村供应点中每个从业人员的服务范围，一般以100至150户左右为宜。供应点要设在交通方便，群众习惯往来的地点。基本上应达到乡乡有点。
    供应点经营的品种，根据“集镇买个全，农村买个便”的原则确定。目前，经营的商品一般有四、五十种，分为四类：生活必需品，日用杂品，临时性需用的商品，季节性的商品。主要是经营生活必需品。据枫泾区的统计，生活必需品的销售量，占供应点经营总额的89％。
    供应点的组织形式是多种多样的，一种是联购分销的合作小组（包括夫妻店和小商小贩），占67％；一种是公私合营和合作商店的从业人员下去的，占23％；再一种是供销合作社直接派人下去的，占10％。从现有效果来看，合作小组的形式最能适应农村市场的供销特点和发挥农村小商小贩的积极性。
    参加供应点工作的人员大体分三种：一种是原来串乡流动或在农村固定零售的小商贩，加以固定或组织起来的；一种是由于商业网的下伸，集镇商店的营业额减少了，按照减少的比例，组织有关行业相应的从业人员下去的；另一种是组织集镇过多的行业的从业人员下去的。下去的人员应该有一定的业务能力和熟悉地区情况，并且要有一定的劳动条件。
    农村供应点经营业务，一般是采取“固定和流动相结合，送货和预购相结合，供应和收购相结合”的方式。目前，各个供应点除了只有一个从业人员的以外，大部分都办理流动预约送货业务；有些县的供应点还开展了代购业务。流动预约送货，必须划定经营范围，避免发生互相竞争和相互抵销力量的现象。收购业务的技术性较大，在一般地区由货郎担专营，在交通不便或水网地区由供应点兼营。农村供应点不经营的商品，集镇组织送货小组下乡。农村供应点还为群众向集镇义务带货，由专业商店给手续费。
    农村供应点的面广、量大，它们同农民的经济生活有不可分割的联系。在业务领导上，应由供销合作社按所属机构分工，采取划片领导的方法。为了保证它更好地为群众服务，就近的高级农业生产合作社党支部应对供应点加强政治上的监督和领导。
    商业网下伸以后，必然使集镇的营业额受到一定程度的影响。但是根据松江专区目前情况来看，集镇在农村商品流转方面仍旧起着核心作用。这主要是因为下去的供应点的经营品种只占群众购买力的15％—20％左右；而集镇本身还负担着居民和一部分农民的直接供应任务。例如枫泾镇负担着14，694人的直接供应任务，占全区人口的24％。商业网下伸后，估算1956年零售额还占全区零售额的68％，比去年下降7％。有些行业目前还不可能下伸，如群众定期需要和挑选性较大的棉布、竹木、五金、陶瓷等行业，和其他经营高级商品的行业。这些行业都负担着整个经济范围内的供应任务，不但不受商业网下伸的影响，而且随着人民生活水平的提高，营业额还将不断上升。
    集镇的商业网除零售网以外，还有采购、批发网，这是小商小贩和农民的集散地，而且一般的都是交通方便，往来客商众多。根据金山县张埝镇的统计，上市成员中来往客商船民占20％左右，他们本身也带来了一部分购买力和消费量。这些情况说明集镇商业网下伸是有一定限度的，今后随着群众购买力的提高，和农业生产合作社劳动制度的建立，业务将会进一步发展扩大。因此，在组织商业网下伸的同时，必须正确地安排集镇和农村商业的分工。松江专区调整商业网的经验还说明，商业网基本上是以零售网为中心的，但饮食、服务、采购、批发网和零售网都有相互依存的关系，因此，在进行商业网调整的时候，还要考虑到各种行业商业网的配置是否合理。此外，对牲畜交易市场和手工业修配应一并进行规划，有步骤地分批地进行调整；对地方工业加工厂、信用社、医疗机构、邮电交通、公用事业等等，也都应该随着商业网的逐步调整，妥善地进行全面安排。
