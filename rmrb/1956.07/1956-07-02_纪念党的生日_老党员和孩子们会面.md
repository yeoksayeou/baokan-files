    纪念党的生日
    老党员和孩子们会面
    据新华社1日讯　昨天晚上，三十多位老共产党员在北京北海公园的少年之家、景山公园的少年宫里，和一千多个少年儿童共同纪念中国共产党的生日。
    二万五千里长征中的战士杜立玉，现在是中国人民解放军上校，向围着他的孩子们讲长征时过草地的艰苦情况，孩子们都向他表示敬意，参加过抗日战争的老共产党员张延宾给孩子们讲抗日战争时期一个名叫小吴的通讯员活捉鬼子的故事，这个故事引起孩子们欢声大笑。在华北抗日根据地打过游击的陈乐正，向孩子们讲三个儿童参加抗日的故事，引起了孩子们很大的兴趣。
    故事讲完以后，孩子们在这些老共产党员的脖子上系上自己的红领巾，最后演出了自己的文艺节目。
