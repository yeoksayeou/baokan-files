Opinion on the Editorial Board's Abridgment of the Article "The Current Situation and Development Direction of Psychology in Our Country"

	It is good that you have abridged my article "The Current Situation and Development Direction of Psychology in Our Country," removing some dispensable words.

	However, the original manuscript mentioned that an Educational Science Research Institute or Educational Science Academy would soon be established, which would also have a department for the study of psychology. These sentences have now been removed. Thus, the ending of the article, which mentions the "research institution to be established," becomes unclear as to what it refers to. In the same place, the sentence about considering the establishment of research institutions for labor psychology and medical psychology seems very one-sided, because it seems that the more important research institution for educational psychology is not even mentioned.

### 对本报编者删节“我国心理学的现状和发展方向”一文的意见

对本报编者删节“我国心理学的现状和发展方向”一文的意见
    你们把我的“我国心理学的现状和发展方向”那篇文章进行了删节，去掉一些可要可不要的话，那是好的。
    但是，在原稿中曾讲到不久要设立教育科学研究所或教育科学院，其中也有研究心理学的部门。这几句话现在被去掉了。这样，文章的结束处讲到“准备要建立的”研究机构就不知何所指，在同一地方讲到要考虑设立劳动心理学和医学心理学的研究机构这样一句话就显得很片面，因为好像对于更重要的教育心理学的研究机构提也不提。
