    Poorly Processed Rice Flour
    The millet and corn flour processed by the Processing Factory of the Boshan District Grain Bureau in Zibo City, Shandong Province, is too coarse to even make *wowotou* (corn bread). The Zibo Building Materials Industry School screened out more than five *jin* of various impurities from the 4,000 *jin* of flour it bought from the factory. Local residents have many complaints about the processing factory's rice flour, but the processing factory turns a deaf ear. (Zhong Tian)

    米粉加工太粗糙
    山东淄博市博山区粮食分局加工厂加工的小米和玉米粉太粗，连窝窝头都做不成。淄博建筑材料工业学校从这个厂买回的四千斤面粉中筛出各种杂物五斤多。当地居民对加工厂加工米粉的意见很多，加工厂却充耳不闻。　（中　田）
