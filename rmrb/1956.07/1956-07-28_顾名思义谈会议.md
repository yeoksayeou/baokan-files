Speaking of Meetings Literally

    A meeting should not only "meet" but also "deliberate." However, some meetings only "meet" but don't "deliberate." After the meeting starts, everyone says something different, unrelated to each other. Those who speak just speak, those who listen just listen, and even if there are differences, there is very little debate.

    In this way, the meeting itself may be calm and peaceful, but unfortunately, it is difficult to play its due role in solving practical problems.

    顾名思义谈会议
    会议，不仅是会，而且要议。可是，有些会议往往只会不议。开会以后，每个人各说一套，互不相关。说的人管说，听的人管听，纵有分歧，也很少争论。
    这样，会议本身固然风平浪静，可惜，在解决实际问题时，也很难发挥它应有的作用。石迢
