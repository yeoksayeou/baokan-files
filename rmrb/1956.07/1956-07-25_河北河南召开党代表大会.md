Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 21st: The first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province was held from July 4th to 16th.

At the congress, criticism and self-criticism were carried out based on the full promotion of democracy, and the leadership work of the previous provincial party committee and certain provincial-level departments was deeply examined. It was also decided to earnestly implement the spirit of criticism and self-criticism developed at the congress into practical work and various meetings.

The congress first listened to the work report made by Lin Tie, secretary of the provincial party committee, on behalf of the previous provincial party committee. The 634 delegates and 60 alternate delegates present at the meeting unanimously expressed satisfaction with the tremendous achievements in various construction undertakings in the seven years since the establishment of the province. They also sharply criticized the bureaucracy and subjectivism existing in the leadership work of the previous provincial party committee and various provincial-level departments.

The congress pointed out that in the spring of 1955, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hebei Province saw its first upsurge, with the number of peasant households joining cooperatives reaching 38% of the total number of peasant households. However, because the provincial party committee at that time lacked class analysis of the problems existing in the movement, blindly wavered from the original development plan, and mistakenly listed stopping development as the guiding principle for the whole year, it dampened the socialist enthusiasm of the peasant masses and fostered negative factors in rural areas. After this right-leaning error was reversed, from last autumn to this spring, the province quickly achieved advanced cooperativization, with the number of peasant households joining cooperatives reaching 99.35% of the total number of peasant households. However, in the face of this victorious situation, the provincial party committee again developed a mood of impatience and rash advance, exceeding realistically possible conditions, and set excessively high targets for increasing grain, cotton, and other production. It also used these excessively high targets and impatient sentiments to guide the movement. In particular, after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), various departments issued directives task by task to agricultural cooperatives, attempting to accomplish in three or four years what would take seven or twelve years. This situation also fostered the practice of not seeking truth from facts within the party and promoted the development of coercive commandism among lower-level cadres.

The congress pointed out that these two errors, one right-leaning and one "left", were closely linked, and their roots were both bureaucracy in leadership style and subjectivism in ideological methods. The lesson learned from these two errors is that when deciding on issues, a comprehensive and profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the conditions must be made, opinions from all sides must be listened to, and full discussions must be unfolded. Only by fully exposing contradictions can contradictions be resolved correctly.

The congress also criticized the previous provincial party committee for relaxing its leadership over industry in the past two or three years and demanded that the new provincial party committee take effective measures to change this. Many delegates also criticized the previous provincial party committee for neglecting the leadership of work in mountainous areas.

The congress also exposed the leadership style of the provincial party committee and certain provincial-level leading departments as characterized by too many meetings, too many documents, and too many forms and reports. They only issued orders from above, did not go deep into the grassroots, did not conduct careful investigations and research, did not pay attention to consulting with the masses, and did not pay attention to adapting their work to the specific time, event, and place. It ordered all provincial-level leading organs and leading cadres to pay attention to correcting these shortcomings in future work.

The congress elected 41 members and 15 alternate members of the Chinese Communist Party Hebei Provincial Committee, as well as 70 delegates and 7 alternate delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

Zhengzhou Dispatch: The first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province was held in Zhengzhou from July 9th to 19th. The congress conscientiously and seriously discussed the work of the entire province, used vivid facts to expose the main contradictions in various tasks, and, in the spirit of fully promoting democracy, extensively unfolded criticism and self-criticism, thereby improving the party's policy and ideological level and enhancing the party's unity.

The congress first listened to the work report made by Wu Zhipu, second secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, on behalf of the provincial party committee. The report pointed out that the work of the entire province of Henan has entered a new stage, and in the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, socialism has achieved a decisive victory. This fundamental change has encouraged the enthusiasm of the people of the province to build socialism and promoted the upsurge of the entire national economy.

In discussing the above report, the delegates present affirmed the achievements in Henan's work, and at the same time, sharply criticized the shortcomings in the work of the provincial party committee. These shortcomings mainly include: insufficient leadership of urban industry, insufficient concern for the welfare of workers, a leadership style that is not in-depth, and a lack of serious investigation and research into actual conditions. In water conservancy construction, the demands were too urgent, which affected the occurrence of coercive commands at the lower levels. At the same time, provincial-level leading organs concentrated too much power, and the enthusiasm of the lower levels could not be well developed. For example, local companies in the financial and trade departments had to have their expenses of five yuan approved by the provincial-level organs; the promotion of a worker in local industrial and mining enterprises also had to be reported to the province for approval. The delegates also criticized the bureaucratic work style of only making decisions without earnestly implementing them, as well as the shortcomings in cultivating and using female cadres, and put forward suggestions for improvement.

A total of 979 delegates attended this congress, representing 509,540 party members in the province. The congress conscientiously and responsibly elected 39 members and 15 alternate members of the new Chinese Communist Party Henan Provincial Committee. When deliberating on the candidates, the delegates repeatedly reviewed each candidate, boldly and frankly put forward their own opinions, and the presidium of the congress promptly adopted everyone's opinions and removed individual former members of the previous provincial party committee with serious shortcomings from the originally proposed list of candidates. The congress also elected 53 delegates and 6 alternate delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

    河北河南召开党代表大会
    据新华社保定21日电　中国共产党河北省第一次代表大会在七月四日到十六日举行。
    这次代表大会在充分发扬民主的基础上开展了批评与自我批评，深刻地检查了上届省委和省级某些部门的领导工作。并且决定要把这次会上开展批评与自我批评的精神，切实贯彻到实际工作中和各种会议中去。
    代表大会首先听取了由省委书记林铁代表上届省委作的工作报告，出席会议的634位代表和六十位候补代表在讨论中，一致对建省七年来各项建设事业的巨大成就表示满意，同时也尖锐地批评了上届省委和省级各部门领导工作中存在的官僚主义和主观主义。
    代表大会指出，1955年春天，河北省的农业合作化运动出现了第一个高潮，全省入社农户达到农户总数的38％。但是，由于当时省委对运动中存在的问题缺乏阶级分析，盲目地动摇了原订的发展计划，并错误地把停止发展列为全年的方针，打击了农民群众的社会主义积极性，助长了农村的消极因素。这一右倾错误得到扭转以后，从去年秋天到今年春天，全省就迅速地实现了高级合作化，入社农户达到总农户的99.35％。但是，省委在这一胜利形势面前又产生了急躁冒进情绪，超越现实可能条件，规定了过高的粮棉等增产指标，并以这种过高的指标与急躁情绪来指导运动。特别是全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，各部门条条下达向农业合作社布置任务，企图把七年、十二年办到的事在三、四年内完成。这种情况也助长了党内不实事求是的作风，促进了下级干部的强迫命令作风的发展。
    大会指出，这一右一“左”的两个错误是紧密相连的，它的根源都是领导作风上的官僚主义和思想方法上的主观主义。从这两个错误中得到的教训是：在决定问题时对于条件要作全面的深刻的马列主义的分析，要倾听各方面的意见，展开充分讨论。充分暴露矛盾，这样才能正确地解决矛盾。
    大会还批评了上届省委在近两三年来放松了对工业的领导，并且要求新的省委采取有效办法加以改变。不少代表对上届省委忽视对山区工作的领导也提出了批评。
    大会还揭发了省委和省级某些领导部门在领导作风上的会议多、文件多、表报多，只在上边发号施令，不深入下层，不细心调查研究，不注意和群众商量，不注意因时因事因地制宜的工作作风，并且责成省级各领导机关和领导干部在今后工作中注意改正。
    大会选举了中共河北省委员会的委员四十一人，候补委员十五人和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表七十人、候补代表七人。
    本报郑州电　中国共产党河南省第一次代表大会七月九日到十九日在郑州市举行。大会认真严肃地讨论了全省的工作，用生动的事实揭发了各种工作中的主要矛盾，在充分发扬民主的精神下，广泛地展开了批评和自我批评，从而提高了党的政策思想水平，增进了党的团结。
    大会首先听取了中共河南省委第二书记吴芝圃代表省委作的工作报告。报告指出，目前河南全省的工作已经走上了一个新的阶段，在资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争中，社会主义已经取得了决定性的胜利。这种根本性的变化，鼓舞了全省人民建设社会主义的积极性，促进了整个国民经济的高涨。
    到会代表在讨论上述报告中，肯定了河南工作中的成就，同时也对省委工作中的缺点提出了尖锐的批评。这些缺点主要是：对城市工业领导不够，对职工生活福利关心不够，领导作风不深入，对实际情况缺乏认真的调查研究。在水利建设上，要求过急，影响到下边发生强迫命令现象。同时，省级领导机关集权多，下面的积极性不能很好地发挥，如财贸部门的地方公司开支五元钱都要经过省级机关批准；地方工矿企业提升一个工人，也要呈报省里批准。代表们还批评了那种只做决定而不认真贯彻执行的官僚主义作风，以及培养和使用妇女干部方面的缺点，并且提出了改进意见。
    出席这次代表大会的代表共有979人，代表着全省509，540名党员。代表大会认真负责地选出了新的中共河南省委会的三十九名委员和十五名候补委员。代表们在酝酿候选人时，对候选人逐个地进行了反复的审查，大胆而坦率地提出了自己的意见，大会主席团及时地采纳了大家的意见，从原提的候选人名单中去掉了个别有严重缺点的前届省委委员。代表大会还选出了出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表五十三人，候补代表六人。
