    Good News of Completing the Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Gains from Competition
    Xinhua News Agency, Zibo, 3rd: According to statistics from the Zibo Mining Bureau as of the end of June, the total output value task for the last year of the Five-Year Plan of the eight state-owned coal mines and three mining machinery repair factories under the bureau has been overfulfilled by 1.06% one and a half years ahead of schedule.
    The miners of the entire bureau actively participated in the socialist competition and promoted 46 advanced experiences, which increased the output of raw coal. This is an important factor in completing the five-year output value plan ahead of schedule. In addition, the number of advanced producers who emerged in the socialist competition in the first half of this year increased by more than double the combined number of previous years before the end of last year. They played a positive leading role in different work positions.
    18 Months Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: By the end of June, the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory had completed the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in five major indicators.
    According to the accounting of the planning department, this, currently the largest power boiler manufacturer in China, has reached the 1957 targets for total production value, product output, labor productivity, profit delivery indicators, and cumulative cost reduction rate eighteen months ahead of schedule. Soon, after completing the cumulative number of new products, this factory can fully complete the first Five-Year Plan.
    In the past three and a half years, this factory has manufactured 24 types of boilers and other lifting machinery for more than 300 enterprises in 30 cities across the country, including more than ten boilers for 6,000-kilowatt turbine generator sets, as well as 100-ton bridge electric cranes, 80-ton tilting winches, and more.
    Last December, all the factory's employees proposed a competition condition to complete the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and participated in the national inter-factory competition. After discussion among the employees, this year's total production value is 28% higher than the 1957 target. In the past six months, the entire factory summarized and promoted 274 advanced experiences and adopted 458 rationalization proposals put forward by employees, ensuring the early realization of the competition conditions.
    Nine New Records
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's iron smelting plant completed the state plan for the first half of this year more than two days ahead of schedule. Product output, quality, and cost all exceeded the state-specified targets. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace's effective volume decreased by 0.133 compared with the same period last year.
    In the first half of this year, iron smelting workers created nine new factory daily output records. The coke they saved in half a year can smelt more than 20,000 tons of pig iron, reducing the cost of pig iron by 1.8 million yuan.
    Safe Operation for 203 Days
    This newspaper reports: Jinxi Cement Plant's No. 2 cement kiln has been operating safely for 203 days, setting the highest national safety record for dry-process cement kilns.
    From 1954 to 1955, the average safe operation of this plant could only reach about 60 days. Last year, they implemented the three major Soviet experiences of water cooling, long combustion, and fast rotary kiln, and learned from the advanced experience of Nishimura Cement Plant's safe operation. No. 2 kiln has been operating continuously and safely for 203 days, from November 21, 1955, to June 11 this year, without any accidents. The long-term safe operation of No. 2 kiln not only provided favorable conditions for the entire plant to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule but also enabled the plant to produce an additional 18,300 tons of cement for the country this year.
    Started Designing Next Year's Project
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd: The Anshan branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute overfulfilled the plan for the first half of the year. All the drawings for the construction projects designed for Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Benxi Iron and Steel Company this year have been submitted by the end of June. The delivery time of the drawings is four months faster than last year, and the quality of the drawings has also been significantly improved.
    In the first half of this year, this design branch promoted Zhang Fengtai's rapid design method, universally broke through the design quota, and the labor productivity generally increased by about 50% compared with the same period last year. They also extensively reused existing drawings in many projects, saving a lot of manpower. Due to the use of parallel sequential working method, the delivery time of the design drawings of some projects was advanced by two to six months compared with the original plan. This method is that before a project starts designing, the main design department first puts forward a rough design requirement to each supporting design department, and after full discussion, then puts forward accurate design data, which can avoid rework and waste.
    Now, this design branch has begun to design next year's project for Angang.
    Realized Their Own Initiative
    This newspaper reports: The No. 508 youth drilling rig of the No. 117 Exploration Team of the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau in the Inner Mongolia grassland drilled 655 meters in one month from May to early June, realizing their initiative of drilling 650 meters per month, which they proposed at the National Coal Industry Advanced Producer Representative Meeting, creating a new national core drilling record in the coal mine system. In realizing their initiative, they worked hard to shorten the auxiliary time, boldly and quickly drilled on the basis of ensuring safety, and earnestly implemented the shift handover, inspection, and other systems, thus achieving good results.
    Now, the workers of this drilling rig have put forward the fighting goal of drilling 700 meters per month. In the ten days from June 7th to 16th, they have drilled 243.21 meters.

    提前完成计划的捷报
    竞赛的收获
    新华社淄博3日电　据淄博矿务局截止六月底的统计，这个局所属的八个国营煤矿和三个矿山机械修理厂，五年计划最后一年的总产值任务，已经提前一年半超额1.06％完成了。
    全局矿工们积极参加社会主义竞赛，并且推广了四十六种先进经验，提高了原煤的产量，这是提前完成五年产值计划的重要因素。此外，这个局在今年上半年的社会主义竞赛当中，新涌现出的先进生产者，比去年年底以前历年的综合数增加了一倍以上。他们在不同的工作岗位上，都起了积极带头的作用。
    提前了18个月
    新华社上海3日电　到六月底为止，国营上海锅炉厂已经在五项主要的指标方面提前完成了第一个五年计划。
    根据计划科的核算，我国这个目前最大的动力锅炉制造厂，已经提前十八个月达到了1957年的生产总值、产品产量、劳动生产率、上缴利润指标和累计的成本降低率。不久，在完成了新品种累计数以后，这个厂就可以全面完成第一个五年计划。
    在过去三年半的时间之内，这个厂为国内三十个城市的三百多个企业，制造了二十四种锅炉和其他起重机械，其中包括有十多台六千瓩汽轮发电设备的锅炉，以及一百吨桥式电动起重机、八十吨倾翻卷扬机等。
    去年十二月，全厂职工提出了提前一年完成第一个五年计划的竞赛条件，参加了全国性的厂际竞赛。经过职工讨论，今年的生产总值比1957年的指标还高28％。半年来，全厂总结和推广了二百七十四条先进经验，采纳了职工提出的四百五十八条合理化建议，保证了竞赛条件的提前实现。
    九创新纪录
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂提前两天多完成了今年上半年的国家计划。产品产量、质量和成本都超过了国家规定的指标。高炉的有效容积平均利用系数，比去年同时期降低了0.133。
    今年上半年，炼铁工人们创造了九次全厂日产量新纪录。他们在半年中节约的焦炭，可以再炼两万多吨生铁，使生铁的成本降低了一百八十万元。
    安全运转203天
    本报讯　锦西水泥厂二号水泥窑安全运转203天，创造了全国干法水泥窑安全运转最高纪录。
    这个厂从1954年到1955年，安全运转平均只能达到六十天左右。去年，他们推行了苏联的水冷却、长燃烧和快转窑等三大经验，又学习了西村水泥厂安全运转的先进经验，二号窑从1955年11月21日起，到今年6月11日止，连续安全运转二百零三天，没有发生事故。二号窑长期安全运转，不仅为全厂提前完成五年计划提供了有利条件，还使这个厂在今年内可以为国家多生产一万八千三百吨水泥。
    开始设计明年的工程
    新华社鞍山3日电　黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院超额完成了上半年的计划。他们为鞍山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司设计的今年施工工程的全部图纸，已经在六月底交出。图纸交付的时间比去年快了四个月，图纸的质量也有显著提高。
    这个设计分院上半年推广了张凤台快速设计法，普遍突破了设计定额，劳动生产率一般比去年同时期提高了50％左右。他们在许多工程上还大量地重复利用已经有的图纸，节省了很多人力。由于运用平行依次工作法，使一些工程的设计图纸的交付时间，比原来的计划提前了两个月到六个月。这个方法就是在一个工程开始设计以前，主体设计科首先向各个配合设计科提出一个概略的设计要求，经过充分讨论以后，再提出准确的设计资料，这样可以避免返工浪费。
    现在，这个设计分院已经开始为鞍钢设计明年的工程。
    实现了自己的创议
    本报讯　内蒙古草原上的华北煤田地质勘探局第117勘探队508号青年钻机，在五月到六月初旬的一个月内钻进655公尺，实现了他们在全国煤炭工业先进生产者代表会议上提出的月进650公尺的倡议，创造了全国煤矿系统岩心钻探新纪录。他们在实现自己倡议的时候，努力缩短了辅助时间，在保证安全的基础上大胆地快速钻进，并且切实地执行了交接班、检查等制度，因而取得良好的成绩。
    现在，这个钻机的工人们又提出月进700公尺的奋斗目标，六月七日到十六日的十天中，已钻进了243.21公尺。
