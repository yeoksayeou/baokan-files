Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: According to a United Press International correspondent in London, Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal, countries with colonies in Africa, along with the Union of South Africa and others, are planning to organize a military alliance in Africa similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The UPI correspondent said that the reason for proposing this plan is because of "the recent evolution of the situation in the Mediterranean region and the development of the general international situation." In this regard, he pointed to the development of relations between the Soviet Union and Middle Eastern and Mediterranean countries, the development of the Middle East situation, and the instability of British military bases. He said that British troops had withdrawn from the Suez base and were also considering withdrawing from the base in Ceylon, and the British base in Cyprus was also unstable. This has changed the situation on the African continent.

The news said that "preliminary discussions have been held on this plan. It is expected that formal discussions will not be held until later this year after detailed preparations have been made." Because, to form this military bloc, it is necessary to "overcome many initial difficulties."

    英法等国想拼凑非洲军事集团
    新华社12日讯　据合众社驻伦敦记者报道，英国、法国、比利时和葡萄牙这些在非洲有殖民地的国家以及南非联邦等国正在筹划在非洲组织一个像北大西洋集团那样的军事联盟。
    合众社记者说，所以提出这种计划，是因为“地中海地区最近局势的演变和一般国际局势的发展”。在这方面，他指出了苏联同中东国家和地中海沿岸国家关系的开展、中东局势的发展以及英国军事基地的不稳。他说，英国军队撤出了苏彝士基地，并且还要考虑撤出在锡兰的基地，英国在塞浦路斯的基地也不稳固。这使非洲大陆的局势发生了变化
    消息说，已经就这个计划“进行了初步的商谈。预料在进行了详细的准备以后在今年晚些时候才能进行正式的商谈。”因为，要组成这个军事集团，还要“克服许多初步的困难”。
