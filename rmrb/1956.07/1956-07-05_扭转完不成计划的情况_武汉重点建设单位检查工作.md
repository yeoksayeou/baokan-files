    Reversing the Situation of Unfulfilled Plans
    Wuhan Key Construction Units Conduct Inspections
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 3rd. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant (formerly known as the Wuhan Heavy Duty Machine Tool Plant), the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant, and five other key capital construction units, will begin a comprehensive inspection today of the execution of the 1956 first-half capital construction plan.
    This time, each unit will mainly inspect project progress, engineering quality, costs, and construction preparation, while simultaneously discovering and resolving problems. At the same time, they will formulate effective measures to complete the second-half plan, to ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of this year's national capital construction plan.
    This inspection was arranged by the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee. This year, the state's capital construction investment in the Wuhan area has increased significantly compared to 1955, with six of the eight key construction projects having successively begun the construction of factory buildings and critical projects. However, the plans of these construction projects for the months of January to June, with the exception of a few units, have mostly been poorly completed. The Municipal People's Committee requires that through this inspection, the execution of the second-half plan can meet the requirements of "more, faster, better, more economical, and safer", to comprehensively complete this year's national plan.

    扭转完不成计划的情况
    武汉重点建设单位检查工作
    新华社武汉3日电　武汉钢铁联合企业、武汉重型机床厂（即武汉重型工具机厂改名）、武汉长江大桥、武汉热电厂等八个重点基本建设单位，从今天起，全面检查1956年上半年基本建设计划的执行情况。
    各单位这次将主要检查工程进度、工程质量、成本和施工准备工作等项目，一边检查，一边发现和解决问题，同时订出完成下半年计划的有效措施，保证全面、超额完成今年国家的基本建设计划。
    这次检查工作，是由武汉市人民委员会布置的。今年国家在武汉地区的基本建设投资，比1955年增加了很多，其中八个重点建设工程，已经有六个先后开始了厂房和关键性工程的建设。但这些建设工程一到六月份的计划，除个别单位外，大都完成得不好。市人民委员会要求通过这次检查，使下半年计划的执行能够达到又多、又快、又好、又省、又安全的要求，全面完成今年的国家计划。
