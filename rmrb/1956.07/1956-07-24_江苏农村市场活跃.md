Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd -- Since the summer grain harvest, primary rural markets in Jiangsu Province have become increasingly active. The total sales of various summer industrial daily necessities in the province have increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year. Sales of undershirts and vests have increased by 60%, and sales of towels, handkerchiefs, and socks have more than doubled. Products such as cologne, face powder, and mosquito coils, which had no market in rural areas in the past, are now becoming popular items.

State-owned department stores in various regions have procured many sturdy, durable, inexpensive, and high-quality new commodities to supply rural areas. For example, aprons made from curtain fabric are brightly colored and very inexpensive. There are also various styles of children's clothing, short socks, and half-sleeved women's undershirts, which are popular among rural consumers.

Recently, small vendors in market towns have been going deep into the countryside to deliver goods and conduct mobile businesses. In Gaoyou County, 360 peddlers have adopted methods such as catching the evening market, and their business volume has generally increased by more than double. Currently, night markets have appeared in many rural areas in Yangzhou and Suzhou prefectures.

    江苏农村市场活跃　
    新华社南京22日电　夏粮上市以来，江苏省农村初级市场日趋活跃。全省各种夏季工业日用品销售总金额比去年同期增加了30％以上。汗衫、背心销售量增加60％，毛巾、手帕和袜子增加一倍多。过去在农村没有销路的花露水、香粉和蚊虫香等商品，现在也成为热销货。　
    各地国营百货公司采购了许多坚实耐用、价廉物美的新商品供应农村。如用窗帘布加工的围涎，花色鲜艳，价格也很便宜。还有各式童装和短统袜和半袖女汗衫等，都受到农村消费者的欢迎。　
    近来集镇小商贩都深入到农村串乡送货，巡回经营。高邮县有三百六十个货郎担采取赶晚市等供应方法，营业额普遍增加一倍多。目前，扬州和苏州等专区有很多农村出现了夜市场。
