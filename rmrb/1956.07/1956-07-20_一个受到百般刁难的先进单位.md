An Advanced Unit Subjected to All Kinds of Difficulties
Luo Tuo

The following is a strange story: A construction team that overfulfilled its plan every month was not able to be evaluated as an advanced unit. This happened on the construction site of the First Construction Engineering Company, a subsidiary of the Baotou Anshan Construction Engineering Company. The construction team in question was the Third Structural Engineering Team (hereafter referred to as Team Three), the very unit that had initiated a proposal to all construction sites in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to complete their annual plan ahead of schedule at the beginning of the year.

The general course of events was as follows.

In January of this year, a work team from the Inner Mongolia Federation of Trade Unions went to the First Construction Engineering Company to understand the planning situation for completing the plan ahead of schedule. At that time, Team Three only had a planning outline that was not yet systematic, but with the help of the work team, the team's overall plan was established, and they proposed an initiative to the entire Inner Mongolia region. After the initiative was put forward, it aroused the dissatisfaction of some people, who ran to ask the company's Party Committee Secretary: "Why cultivate Team Three? Who decided that?" The Party Committee Secretary panicked when he heard this and quickly explained: "We haven't designated them as a priority. Each team is a priority!" The matter passed just like that.

The proposal was indeed an encouragement to all the staff of Team Three. However, people from other engineering teams were unconvinced and said, "This is boasting," "There's no proper calculation at all," "This is reckless, trying to show off." As a result, this initiative had a large impact outside, but no one inside the company responded to it. Some people even said to members of Team Three, "You're the proposing unit, you can try to be a model!" From then on, the people of Team Three practically became people who couldn't hold their heads up! However, the people of Team Three were not discouraged. They thought the leadership would support them.

In fact, Team Three's plan fell through. Their team only had three technicians and no technical director. They asked the leadership to appoint cadres and equip the personnel to prepare for construction work. What did the leadership say? They said, "Soon, it will be decided in a few days." The Team Three captain also raised the issue with the leadership: "We are the proposing unit. If the leadership is insufficient, it will have a bad impact if we don't complete the task. We hope it can be resolved in time." The answer they received was: "You are the proposing unit? Now, socialist construction enthusiasm is high, who isn't a proposing unit?" Team Three raised this issue again based on the regulations for the establishment of each team. At this time, the leadership spoke their true feelings: "If we give it to you, other engineering teams will say the leadership is supporting you!" The technical director has still not been appointed to this day.

From then on, not only was it difficult to mention the initiative in the team, but even the leadership no longer dared to mention it. Apart from the trade union organization looking for Team Three when they wanted to promote advanced experiences, no one cared whether this team could achieve the initiative it had put forward.

After hitting walls everywhere, Team Three did not fall down. They thought that in this upsurge of building socialism, they should make the greatest efforts to better complete construction tasks. If the company leadership doesn't support us, we'll work harder ourselves. In the past few months, they have promoted many advanced experiences, researched and developed various single-person mortar spreaders according to the needs of the construction site, created the mobile lift line method, summarized Men Guoyou's tile hanging method, and implemented assembly line operations. They first improved labor organization within the team, formed mixed squads, and promoted the team economic accounting system. But the hard work of all comrades in Team Three did not change their situation.

In April, when the First Engineering Company conducted internal evaluations of work performance, Team Three completed 101.72% of the monthly plan in terms of labor productivity among the five major indicators, saving 1,577 workdays. They also did well in reducing costs, safe operation, and promoting advanced experiences. With the concrete facts in front of them, of course, others had nothing to say. But during the quality inspection, the Fourth Structural Engineering Team and the Second Structural Engineering Team insisted that the quality of Team Three was not good and demanded to inspect the site. So, they chose the houses built by the Team Three Youth Commando to inspect. Everyone used plumb bobs to check one by one, dozens of people looking for problems back and forth. Finally, they found one wall that was slightly uneven, differing by a little over a centimeter. As a result, everyone unanimously agreed that the quality of the Third Engineering Team was not good, saying that although the First Structural Engineering Team had more accidents and more rework, its self-inspection records were good, and it should be considered to have good quality. Was this evaluation fair? During the acceptance, the houses built by the First Structural Engineering Team and other engineering teams, which were rated as having good quality by "everyone," were considered substandard by the acceptance unit, and not a single one was accepted, except for the thirty-seven houses built by Team Three.

Finally, a dispute broke out over the issue of evaluating advanced units. Because Team Three still had three tiles that had not been hung up on the afternoon of the last day, the captain, in order to encourage the workers to work harder, also went up to the roof to help nail the tile boards. As a result, other teams had an excuse: "This working method is not normal." "The engineering captain doing the work doesn't count as completing the monthly plan!" "It's okay to rank first in performance, but you can't give them the title of advanced unit!" At this time, the Party Committee Secretary also said: "If you all agree not to evaluate, then we won't evaluate. I agree with everyone's opinion." Team Three inexplicably got first place, but lost the title of "advanced unit."

As a result of the April evaluation, despite the many difficulties everyone gave to Team Three, they were still rewarded. In May, the team completed 106% of the monthly plan. At this time, the original monthly evaluation work was suspended, and there was still no news by late June.

Why is it that a unit like the Third Structural Engineering Team is not only not welcomed and encouraged, but also encounters so many difficulties, and why is the leadership so indifferent to them? It is because the leading staff of this engineering company are afraid of the struggle between leading the advanced and lagging behind, and they dare not criticize some incorrect ideas in the minds of the masses, nor dare they positively support advanced things. Little do they know that this is a concession to conservative ideas. So, although they shout every day on the surface that they are vigorously carrying out the advanced producer movement and expanding the ranks of advanced producers, in reality, they are holding back the people who are moving forward!

    一个受到百般刁难的先进单位
    骆驼
    下面是一段奇怪的故事：一个工程队，月月超额完成计划，却不能被评为先进单位。这件事，发生在包头鞍山建设工程公司分公司所属第一建筑工程公司的工地上，那个工程队是第三结构工程队（以下简称三队），也就是在年初向内蒙古自治区所有建筑工地倡议提前完成年计划的单位。
    事情大概的经过是这样的。
    今年一月份，内蒙古工会联合会的一个工作组，到第一建筑工程公司了解提前完成计划的规划情况。当时，三队只有还不成系统的规划，但是在工作组的帮助下就把全队的规划订出来了，并且向内蒙古全区提出了倡议。倡议提出之后，引起了某些人的不满，便跑去问公司党委书记：“为什么培养三队，是通过谁决定的？”党委书记一听就慌了，连忙解释：“咱们也没有培养他们当重点，各队都是重点嘛！”事情就这样过去了。
    倡议的提出，对三队的全体职工确实是个鼓舞。但是，其他工程队的人都不服气说：“这是吹牛”、“根本也没有好好计算”、“这是冒险，是出风头”。因此，这个倡议在外面影响很大，而在公司内部却是没有人响应的。有些人见了三队的人还说：“你们是倡议单位，能争取作模范了！”三队的人从此简直变成抬不起头的人了！不过，三队的人没有气馁，他们以为领导上会支持他们的。
    其实，三队的这个打算落空了。他们队只有三个技术员，没有技术主任，要求领导上给确定干部，把人员配齐，好作施工准备工作。领导上怎么说呢？说：“快了，过几天就决定。”三队队长又向领导上提出：“我们是倡议单位，领导力量不足，完不成任务影响也不好，希望能够及时给以解决。”结果，得到的回答是：“你们是倡议单位？现在社会主义建设热情高涨了，谁不是倡议单位呢？”三队又根据各队编制的规定提出这个问题，领导上这时却说了真心话：“要给你们了，别的工程队更该说领导上支持你们了！”技术主任直到现在也没有给确定。
    从此，关于倡议的事，不但队里不好提，就连领导上也再不敢提这件事了。除了工会组织要推广先进经验的时候要找三队外，这个队能不能实现提出的倡议，是没有人管的。
    到处碰壁以后，三队没有倒下去。他们想，在这建设社会主义的高潮中，应当是以最大的努力，更好地完成建设任务，公司领导不支持，我们自己加劲干。几个月以来，他们推广了很多先进经验，按照工地需要研究出各种单人铺灰器，创造了活动升线法，总结了门国友的挂瓦方法，实行流水作业。他们首先在队内改善劳动组织，编成混合小队，推行了班组经济核算制度。但是三队全体同志的辛勤努力，并没有改变他们的处境。
      四月份，第一工程公司内部进行工作成绩评比的时候，三队在五大指标当中，劳动生产率完成月计划101.72％，节省了1，577个工作日，降低成本，安全操作和推广先进经验都作得不错。具体事实摆在那里，别人当然是无话可说的。但是在质量检查的时候，第四结构工程队和第二结构工程队硬说三队的质量不好，要到现场检查。于是挑三队青年突击队盖的房子进行检查。大家挨个拿线锤吊，几十个人来回找毛病，最后终于找到一面墙有点凹凸不平，差了一公分多。于是，大家一致通过第三工程队的质量不好，说第一结构工程队虽然事故多返工多，但是自检记录好，应当算质量好。这样评的是否公平呢？在验收的时候被“大家”评为质量好的第一结构工程队和其他的几个工程队所盖的房子，验收单位认为质量不合规格，一栋都不接收，只收了三队的三十七栋房子。
    最后，为了评定先进单位的问题展开了一场争执。因为三队最后一天的下午还有三栋瓦没有挂上，队长为了鼓励工人再加一把劲突击出来，自己也上房帮助钉瓦板。于是别的队也有了借口：“这种工作方法不是正常的。”“工程队长动手不算完成月计划！”“成绩排在第一还可以，不能给先进单位的称号！”这时，党委书记也这样说：“你们都同意不评就不评，同意你们大家的意见。”三队就是这样不明不白的闹了个第一，却失掉了“先进单位”的称号。
    四月份评比的结果，尽管大家给三队出了许多难题，他们还是受到了奖励。五月份，这个队又完成月计划106％。这时，原规定每月一次的评比工作却中止了，直到六月下旬依然没有消息。
    为什么像第三结构工程队这样的单位，不仅没有受到欢迎和鼓励，还要遇到这样多的刁难呢，领导上为什么对他们这样冷淡呢？就是因为这个工程公司的领导工作人员害怕领导先进同落后之间的斗争，既不敢对群众思想中一些不正确的思想进行批判，也不敢正面支持先进的事物，殊不知这就是对保守思想的迁就。所以尽管他们每天表面上喊着大张旗鼓地开展先进生产者运动、扩大先进生产者的队伍，而实际上却把前进着的人们的腿拖住了！
