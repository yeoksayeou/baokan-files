Capital's Twenty-Plus Factories Report Success

By June 29th, over twenty state-owned and locally-owned factories in Beijing had already completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. The main products completed include pig iron, metallurgical coke, cast pipes, machine tools, automobile accessories, steel beams, cement, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant increased its pig iron production by more than 6,500 tons in six months. Thanks to continuous improvement in technology and labor organization, workers at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory increased labor productivity by nearly 100% in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year. The First Automobile Accessories Factory completed its production plan for the first half of the year on the 27th, producing twenty kinds of automobile accessories for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, including carburetors and headlights. The total production value completed by this factory in the first half of this year increased by 33% compared to the same period last year.

The quality of the products produced by these factories is good. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and the First Automobile Accessories Factory have established strict quality inspection systems to ensure that all products leaving the factory are fully qualified. The quality index of cotton cloth at the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Factory reached 99.5%, exceeding the national standard.

Promoting 69 Advanced Experiences Increased Fan Production by 230 Units

The Shenyang Fan Factory completed its total output value plan for the first half of the year seventeen days ahead of schedule, overproducing two hundred and thirty fans. This factory promoted sixty-nine effective advanced experiences from home and abroad in the first half of this year, solving key production issues and improving workers' production levels. Large workshops use the Soviet Union's advanced welding methods, which not only ensures quality on five major products but also increases efficiency by 85%. After mastering advanced experiences such as single-tool multi-blade and Unanov tool methods, workers in the processing workshop generally improved their work efficiency by more than 100%, with the highest reaching 600%.

Safety Competition Launched
Yumen Oilfield Increases Crude Oil Production

By June 30th, the Yumen Oilfield had overfulfilled its crude oil production plan for the first half of the year by 2%. This year, the Yumen Oilfield's crude oil production plan increased by 43.27% compared to 1955. In the first half of the year, oil extraction workers launched a competition for "continuous safe completion of production tasks every ten days for half a year" and actively promoted many advanced technical experiences. After implementing the "fracturing" well repair method in a batch of oil wells in the Petroleum Gulch Oilfield, which belongs to the Yumen Oilfield, crude oil production increased more than twofold, with some wells increasing tenfold. Since the beginning of this year, workers have also actively developed small-yield oil layers and promoted new well repair methods in small-yield oil layers.

Strengthening Leadership Over Backward Workshops
Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory Completes Plan

The state-owned Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory fully completed the national production plan for the first half of this year yesterday afternoon.

The Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory began transitioning from producing ordinary tools to producing special tools such as gear cutting tools and insert tools this year. Since March, the factory has launched an advanced producer movement, vigorously promoting advanced experiences, which has generally improved work efficiency. The factory's relatively backward First Workshop had failed to complete its plan for more than ten consecutive months. Because leadership over this workshop was strengthened, the enthusiasm of the masses was brought into play, and the key problem of planing beds in this workshop was solved, the situation of failing to complete the plan was also reversed.

Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory
Overcomes Difficulties of Insufficient Tool Materials

The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory actively found ways to solve the difficulty of insufficient tool materials, completing the first half-year's total output value, labor productivity, cost, and profit plans six days ahead of schedule. The forging die required for the welding heads produced by this factory used to be frequently in short supply. In March of this year, they improved the forging die heat treatment method, increasing the durability of the forging die by four times, solving the problem of insufficient supply. This increased the output of alloy welding heads in the second quarter by 31% compared to the first quarter. For example, when the factory produced plate feeders and scraper conveyors, steel plates and channel steel were once insufficient. However, thanks to the competition among various departments to actively find sources of goods and inventory warehouses, and actively contact 14 fraternal factories and mines, they exchanged 110 tons of steel plates and channel steel with their own backlog and non-urgent materials, which promptly solved the needs of production.

    提前完成上半年计划
    首都二十多个工厂报捷
    到6月29日为止，北京市已经有二十多个国营、地方国营工厂，提前完成了今年上半年的生产计划。完成的主要产品，有生铁、冶金焦、铸管、机床、汽车附件、钢梁、水泥、棉布、棉纱等。
    石景山钢铁厂在六个月里共增产了生铁六千五百多吨。北京农业机械厂的工人由于不断地改进技术和劳动组织，今年上半年的劳动生产率比去年上半年提高了将近一倍。第一汽车附件厂在二十七日就完成了上半年的生产计划，工人们为第一汽车制造厂生产了化油器、车前大灯等二十种汽车附件。这个厂所完成的今年上半年的生产总值，比去年同期增长了33％。
    这些工厂生产的产品质量良好。北京农业机械厂和第一汽车附件厂，由于建立了严格的质量检查制度，保证了出厂的产品完全合格。北京国棉一厂棉布质量指标达到99.5％，超过了国家规定的标准。推广69种先进经验增产扇风机230台
    本报沈阳电　沈阳扇风机厂提前十七天完成了今年上半年的总产值计划，超产二百三十台扇风机。这个厂今年上半年推广了六十九种国内外行之有效的先进经验，解决了生产关键，提高了工人生产水平。大型车间运用苏联的先进焊接法，工人们不仅能够在五种主要产品上保证质量，还能提高效率85％。加工车间的工人们掌握了单刀多刃、乌纳诺夫车刀法等先进经验后，一般工作效率都提高一倍以上，最高的能提高六倍。
    展开安全竞赛
    玉门油矿原油增产
    新华社玉门1日电　到六月三十日，玉门油矿超额2％完成了今年上半年的原油生产计划。今年，玉门油矿的原油生产计划，比1955年增加了43.27％。上半年内，采油工人们掀起了“半年旬旬连续安全完成生产任务”的竞赛，并且积极推广了许多项先进的技术经验。玉门油矿所属的石油沟油田，今年在一批油井推行“压裂”的修井方法后，原油产量比过去增加了两倍多，有的井增产了十倍。今年以来，工人们还积极开发小产量油层，并且在小产量油层中推行了新的修井方法。
    加强对落后车间的领导
    哈尔滨第一工具厂完成计划
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　国营哈尔滨第一工具厂在昨天下午，全面完成了今年上半年国家生产计划。
    哈尔滨第一工具厂是从今年开始由生产普通工具转为生产齿轮刀具、镶片刀具等特殊工具的。从今年三月以来，全厂开展了先进生产者运动，大力推广先进经验，使工作效率普遍提高。这个厂较落后的第一车间，曾经连续十多个月没有完成计划。因为加强了对这个车间的领导，发挥了群众的积极性，解决了这个车间铲床方面的关键问题，也扭转了完不成计划的局面。
    沈阳矿山机械厂
    战胜了工具材料不足的困难
    本报沈阳电　沈阳矿山机械厂积极想办法解决工具材料不足的困难，提前6天完成了上半年总产值、劳动生产率、成本、利润计划。这个工厂生产的焊头需要的锻模，过去经常供不应求，今年三月份他们改进了锻模热处理方法，锻模的耐用程度提高了4倍，解决了供应不足的问题，使今年第二季度合金焊头的产量比第一季度提高31％。又如工厂生产板式给矿机、刮板运输机时，钢板和槽钢一度不足，但由于各科室开展竞赛，主动寻找货源和清点仓库，并积极和14个兄弟厂矿联系，将自己厂内积压的和不急需的材料和他们调换，换了110多吨钢板、槽钢，及时解决了生产的需要。
