    Sichuan State-Owned Farms
    Stockpile Improved Wheat and Rapeseed Varieties
    Xinhua News Agency Report Sichuan Province's one hundred and seventy-plus special districts and counties' state-owned farms have stockpiled over four million jin of improved wheat and rapeseed varieties, ready to supply them to farmers during the autumn and winter sowing seasons.
    This batch of improved seeds was specially cultivated and propagated by state-owned farms in various locations last winter and this spring, including "Nanda 2419" wheat, "Victory Rapeseed," and many other improved varieties.
    According to the person in charge of relevant departments of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, based on the planned wheat and rapeseed acreage for the entire province this year, the rapeseed varieties stockpiled by state-owned farms in various locations can basically meet the needs. The wheat varieties still need to be propagated once more by agricultural producers' cooperatives in seed retention plots in various locations in order to roughly meet the sowing needs. Nevertheless, this batch of improved seeds stockpiled by state-owned farms in various locations this year will still play a significant role in alleviating the tight supply of improved seeds.

    四川国营农场
    储备小麦油菜良种
    新华社讯　四川省一百七十多个专区和县的国营农场，已经储备小麦、油菜良种共四百多万斤，准备在秋、冬播种期间供应农民。
    这批良种是各地国营农场在去冬今春专门培育繁殖出来的，包括“南大二四一九”小麦、“胜利油菜”以及其他许多良种。
    据四川省农业厅有关部门的负责人谈，按照全省今年计划播种的小麦、油菜面积，各地国营农场储备的良种中，油菜良种已经基本上可以满足需要，小麦良种还要由各地的农业生产合作社在留种地里再繁殖一次，才能大体上满足播种的需要。尽管如此，今年各地国营农场储备的这批良种，对改善良种供应的紧张状况仍有很大的作用。
