    Solve the Algerian Question Through Peaceful Negotiation
    I am a student majoring in French Language and Literature at Peking University. I love the glorious history of the French nation and the French people. However, the recent atrocities of the French colonialists in Algeria cannot but make me feel extremely angry.
    Prime Minister Mollet has repeatedly emphasized his willingness to resolve the Algerian issue peacefully. However, what is puzzling is that the French government is increasing troops and sending generals to Algeria, launching a major war.
    It seems that the French colonialists have not yet understood: in an era of awakening colonial peoples, colonialism is unwanted garbage everywhere. Whether the colonialists like it or not, the people of any colony will gain the right to independence and self-determination. There will be no exception in Algeria. If France insists on going its own way and acting arbitrarily to the end, it will only isolate itself further and will eventually be driven out by the Algerian people.
    I hope that the French government will immediately change its policy of repression against Algeria, because this is not in the interests of the French nation. And the real national interests of France lie in opposing the economic infiltration from across the Atlantic and the threat to its independence.

    用和平协商办法解决阿尔及利亚问题
    我是北京大学法兰西语言文学专业的学生。我热爱法兰西民族的光荣历史，热爱法国人民。但是，最近法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的暴行，却不能不使我感到极大的愤怒。
    摩勒总理曾一再强调愿意和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。但是，令人费解的是，法国政府却在阿尔及利亚增兵遣将，大动干戈。
    看来，法国殖民主义者还没有懂得：在殖民地人民觉醒的时代，殖民主义是任何地方都不需要的垃圾。不管殖民主义者喜欢不喜欢，任何殖民地的人民都将得到独立和自决的权利。在阿尔及利亚也决不会有什么例外。如果法国硬要一意孤行，蛮干到底的话，只有使它自己更加陷于孤立，而最后终于要被阿尔及利亚人民赶出去。
    我希望法国政府立即改变对阿尔及利亚的镇压政策，因为这是不符合法国民族利益的。而法国真正的民族利益，在于反对大西洋彼岸来的经济渗入和对它独立的威胁。
