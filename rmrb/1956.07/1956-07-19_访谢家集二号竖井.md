    Visiting the Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft

    Approaching the Bagong Mountain new coalfield area of the Huainan Coal Mine, one will be attracted from afar by the buildings on the industrial square of the Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft. Anyone who has visited the Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft project will be deeply proud of the heroic labor of the shaft construction workers. During the twenty-eight months of shaft construction, the workers who built these shafts constantly waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters such as water, fire, and gas. They opened up a total of about thirty *li* of underground tunnels, built more than 70,000 square meters of houses on the ground, and installed more than 4,900 kilowatts of various mechanical equipment above and below the well.

    The Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft is the first pair of modern large-scale mines designed by Chinese technicians with the help of Soviet experts. The entire production process, from coal mining to loading coal into trains for outward transportation, is mechanized and automated. Li Shiling, the transportation section chief of the mine, pointed to the huge mechanical transportation system on the ground and told the reporter: "Now, only one person is needed to start up all this mechanical equipment. Compared with mines without this kind of transportation machinery, it can save at least two thousand ground transportation workers."

    Coal production is now starting. The driver, sitting in the operating room at the wellhead, deftly pressed the button, and all the ground transportation machinery started to move. A skip of the main shaft, loaded with six tons of coal, was hoisted up from underground and automatically dumped the coal into the coal separation building. After the coal and gangue were automatically separated in the coal separation building, a large amount of coal flowed like water through the belt conveyor and into the railway coal bunker. The coal bunker has six large compartments, each with a funnel at the bottom. The coal is loaded through the funnel into the train cars parked under the coal bunker.

    We boarded a cage resembling an elevator and reached the bottom of the well, one hundred and sixty meters deep. Looking out from the underground parking lot, the wide main roadway looked like a road, the tunnels were brightly lit, and electric locomotives were constantly moving. The air underground was clear and unobstructed. I was sweating profusely from the heat above ground, but it immediately dissipated after coming down.

    Here we saw again the process of underground transportation mechanization and automation. A trolley locomotive was pulling a train of coal-laden mine cars, rumbling from the coal mining area's parking lot to the bottom of the well. When the train arrived at the bottom parking lot, the workers pressed the button on the chain locking device, and the chain-type car pusher automatically crawled forward, sending the loaded mine cars to the circular car tippler, dumping the coal into the coal bunker at the bottom of the main shaft. The coal is automatically loaded through this coal bunker into the coal-loading skip, and hoisted by the main shaft to the ground.

    After passing through more than 2,000 meters of main and branch tunnels, we arrived at a newly opened coal mining site in the southern part of the mining area. The coal miners were installing a coal cutting machine, and soon they would be using this machinery to mine coal. They told reporters that using this mechanical coal cutting machine would only require three people.

    We also saw many safety and welfare facilities underground. There are pump rooms, medical clinics, and fire train depots. In the fire train depot, a certain amount of various fire-fighting equipment is stored. In the event of an unexpected disaster underground, the fire-fighting equipment can be sent to the disaster area within ten minutes for rescue. There are also many water sprinkler pipes to prevent coal dust from flying from the mining area parking lot to the coal mining site. If a fire breaks out underground, it can also release a large amount of water to extinguish the fire.

    Safety facilities in other aspects of the mine are also relatively complete. For example, in the ventilation fan rooms on the ground on the south and north wings of the mine, reverse ventilation equipment is installed. If a fire occurs underground, it can quickly change the direction of the airflow, preventing the fire from spreading into the coal mining area. Overwind protection devices and rope break safety devices are also installed at the wellhead and on the cages. When the cage is hoisted from underground to the ground, if it exceeds a certain height, the electric door will automatically close, stopping the cage. In the event of a rope break, the rope break safety device can immediately jam the cage onto the cage guide in the shaft, preventing the cage from falling to the bottom of the well.

    After coming up from the mine, we took a shower in the bathroom of the welfare complex building. This welfare complex building has more than 500 square meters, with changing rooms, bathrooms, sunlamp rooms, and laundry rooms. Before going down the well, miners go to the changing room to change into work clothes and collect water bottles and mine lamps for going down the well. When work is finished and they come up the well, they come here to shower and use the sunlamps. When clothes are dirty, there will be special washing machines to wash the workers' clothes. In winter, when the heating is turned on, the room is warm as spring.

    With the commissioning of the Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft, a new worker's residential village has also been completed. Each worker's family has two rooms and a kitchen, and the rooms are also furnished with some necessary furniture. (Attached picture)

    访谢家集二号竖井
    新华社记者　汤天真
    走近淮南煤矿八公山新煤田区，老远就会被谢家集二号竖井工业广场上的建筑物所吸引。凡是参观过谢家集二号竖井工程的人，都会深深地为建井工人们英雄般的劳动而自豪。建设这对竖井的职工在二十八个月的建井期间里，不断地向水、火和瓦斯等自然灾害进行顽强的斗争。他们开拓的地下巷道，总共约有三十华里，在地面上建筑了七万多平方公尺的房屋，还在井上井下安装了四千九百多瓩的各种机械设备。
    谢家集二号竖井是我国技术人员在苏联专家帮助下设计的第一对现代化的大型矿井。它从采煤一直到把煤装进火车外运的全部生产过程，都是机械化和自动化的。这个矿的运输区区长李时岭指着地面庞大的机械运输系统告诉记者说：现在只要有一个人就可以把这套机械设备全部开动起来。和没有这种运输机械的矿井比较，最少也能节省两千多名地面运输工。
    现在开始出煤了。坐在井口操纵室里的司机，敏捷地按动电钮以后，全部地面运输机械就活动起来了。一个装有六吨煤炭的主井箕斗从井下被提升上来，自动地把煤倾泄在选矸楼里。经过选矸楼自动的把煤和矸子分开以后，大量的煤炭就像流水般的经过皮带运输机，送到铁路煤仓里。煤仓拥有六个大仓斗，每个仓斗底下都有一个漏斗，煤就是经过漏斗装进停在煤仓下面的火车箱里去。
    我们乘上一个电梯模样的罐笼，到达了一百六十公尺深的井下。从井底车场望出去，宽阔的大巷像马路，巷道里灯火辉煌，电机车络绎不绝。井下空气畅通，刚才在井上热的满身大汗，下来后立刻就消散了。
    在这里我们又看到了井下运输机械化和自动化的过程。一辆架线式电机车牵引着一列满载煤炭的矿车，隆隆的从采煤区车场向井底车场驶过来。当列车到达井底车场以后，工人们按动了链锁装置的电钮，链式推车机就自动向前爬行起来，把装满煤炭的矿车送到圆形翻罐笼里，把煤翻进主井井底的煤仓内。煤就是经过这个煤仓自动的装进装煤的箕斗，由主井提升到地面的。
    穿过两千多公尺的大巷和支巷，我们来到了矿区南部一个新开辟的采煤场子。采煤工人们正在安装割煤机，不久就要用这种机械采煤了。他们告诉记者，使用这种机械采煤只要三个人就够了。
    在井下我们还看到了许多安全和福利设施。这里有水泵房、医疗所和消防列车库等。在消防列车库里，储存一定数量的各种消防器材，万一井下发生意外的灾害，在十分钟以内就可以把消防器材送到灾害地区，进行抢救。从采区车场到采煤场子还设有许多防止煤尘飞扬的撒水管，如果井下发生火灾，它还可以放出大量的水把火扑灭。
    矿井其他方面的安全设施也都比较完备。如在矿井南、北两翼地面的抽风机房里，都装有反风设备。如果井下发生火灾，它可以迅速改变风流的方向，使火灾不能够向采煤区里蔓延。在井口和罐笼上，还设有过卷装置和断绳保险器的装置。罐笼从井下提升到地面的时候，如果超过了一定的高度，电门就会立即自动关闭，使罐笼停下来。万一断了罐绳，断绳保险器可以立即把罐笼卡在井筒的罐道上，不使罐笼跌落到井底去。
    从矿井里上来后，我们在福利联合大楼的洗澡间里进行淋浴。这个福利联合大楼有五百多平方公尺，里面有更衣室、洗澡间、太阳灯室和洗衣间等设置。矿工们下井前，先到更衣室换上工作服，领取下井用的水壶和矿灯。工作完毕上井的时候，就到这里进行淋浴和照射太阳灯。衣服脏了，将来还有专门的洗衣机为工人们刷洗。到冬天，暖气开放，室内温暖如春。
    随着谢家集二号竖井的投入生产，一个新的工人住宅村也落成了。这里每个工人家庭都有两间住房和一个厨房，室内还陈放一些必要的家具。（附图片）
