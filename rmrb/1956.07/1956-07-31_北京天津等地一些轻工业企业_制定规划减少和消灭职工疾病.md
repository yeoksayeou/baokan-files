Some light industrial enterprises in Tianjin, Beijing, Harbin, Shenyang and Qingdao have recently formulated plans for the prevention and treatment of diseases, or improved the prevention and medical care of diseases, thereby reducing the pain of employee illnesses and reducing absenteeism due to illness, which is very popular with employees.

When formulating plans, each factory generally analyzes the causes of employee illnesses in detail, determines the main types of diseases, proposes prevention and treatment methods for different diseases, and stipulates the annual cure rate and morbidity reduction targets. After mass discussion and leadership approval, various relevant departments are assigned responsibilities for implementation.

In formulating plans for the prevention and treatment of diseases, the following issues are generally noted.

The principle of "prevention first." Some factories, based on annual disease statistics, infectious disease epidemics, increases in certain diseases, seasonal changes, and other circumstances, adopt a variety of methods to publicize to employees. Shenyang Cigarette Factory held an exhibition of menstrual belts and triangular scarves to publicize health knowledge to female employees in order to prevent gynecological diseases. In addition to carrying out publicity in accordance with the annual health publicity program, Qingdao Cigarette Factory used weekend group inspections of production plans to publicize the disease situation and causes of illness within a week when there were the most sick people. The factory also used physical objects for publicity. After the employees saw the microorganisms in the water under the microscope, they all said, "Seeing is believing," and immediately changed their habit of drinking raw water.

Improving working conditions and environmental hygiene is an effective way to prevent disease. Workers in the malt section of the Tianjin State-owned Alcohol Factory often suffer from back and leg pain because of the high humidity in the room and the workers working barefoot. The factory plans to issue high-waisted rubber shoes and rubber pants to the workers. Many workers bring their own meals, and because there are not enough steamers, they often eat cold meals, so stomach diseases account for 17% of the factory's morbidity rate. The factory plans to add a steamer. They have also improved the disinfection of tableware and the cleaning of toilets.

These factories also actively and comprehensively solve the treatment and recuperation problems of sick employees. The staff of the Qingdao Cigarette Factory's health station adopted the method of universal inspection and separate treatment, using the factory's own sanatorium to treat chronic gastritis and rheumatism that could be treated in the factory; for dental and eye diseases that could not be treated in the factory, they established special relationships with specialist clinics and mobilized employees to go for treatment. Some factories are expanding their own sanatoriums while trying to sign sanatorium contracts with sanatoriums run by higher-level trade unions, local governments, and other agencies, and sending employees for treatment one after another. Harbin Leather Factory changed the clinic into a health station, directly led by the factory director, and set up branch stations in the factory department and workshops. The factory department branch station is responsible for the treatment and consultation of diseases of departments and family members, and the workshop branch station is responsible for treating workers, and adopts the method of nurses delivering medicine to the workshop, reducing the time workers spend seeing a doctor. In the first quarter, a total of 899 work hours were saved for workers to see a doctor. Workers can make 128 pairs of shoes and increase piece-rate wages by 245 yuan by using this time.

    北京天津等地一些轻工业企业
    制定规划减少和消灭职工疾病
    本报讯　天津、北京、哈尔滨、沈阳和青岛等地的一些轻工业企业，最近分别制定了防治疾病规划，或改进对疾病的预防和医疗工作，因而减轻了职工疾病的痛苦，降低了因病的缺勤率，很得到职工的拥护。
    各厂在制定规划的时候，一般都详细分析职工致病原因，确定主要疾病种类，针对不同疾病提出防治办法，分别规定逐年治愈率和降低发病率指标，经群众讨论，领导批准，由各有关部门分工负责加以实现。
    在制定防治疾病的规划中，一般都注意了以下几个问题。
    以“预防为主”的方针。有些厂根据每年疾病统计资料，传染病流行，某种疾病增多，季节变化等情况，采取多种多样的方式向职工进行宣传。沈阳烟厂为预防妇女病，举办了月经带和三角巾展览会，向女职工宣传卫生常识。青岛卷烟厂除按全年卫生宣传纲要进行宣传外，当病号最多的时候，利用周末小组检查生产计划会议，宣传一周内疾病情况和患病原因。这个厂还用实物宣传，职工们在显微镜下看到水里的微生物以后，都说“百闻不如一见”，立刻改变喝生水的习惯。
    改善劳动条件及环境卫生，这是防止疾病的有效办法。天津国营酒精厂麦芽工段工人常患腰腿疼痛病，原因是室内湿度大，工人赤脚作业。工厂计划给工人发高腰胶皮鞋和胶皮裤。很多工人是自带饭菜，因为蒸锅不够用，常有吃冷饭的，所以患胃病的占全厂发病率的17％。工厂就计划增设蒸锅一个。他们还改进了食具消毒和厕所清洁工作。
    这些工厂还积极地、多方面地解决患病职工的治疗和疗养问题。青岛卷烟厂保健站工作人员采取普遍检查，分别治疗的办法，把本厂能够治疗的慢性胃病、风湿症，一律利用业余疗养所给患者治疗；对本厂不能治疗的牙病、眼病等，就同专科诊所建立特约关系，动员职工前往治疗。有些厂一面扩大本厂疗养机构，一面设法同上级工会、地方政府及其他机关举办的疗养所签订疗养合同，陆续输送职工治疗。哈尔滨皮革厂把医务所改为保健站，由厂长直接领导，在厂部、车间分别设立分站。厂部分站负责科室及家属的疾病治疗和会诊工作，车间分站负责给工人治疗，并且采取护士送药到车间的办法，减少工人看病时间。第一季度共节省工人看病时间八百九十九个工时。工人利用这些时间可以做一百二十八双鞋，增加计件工资二百四十五元。
