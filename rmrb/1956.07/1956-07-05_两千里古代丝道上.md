Silk Production is Developing

    On the Two-Thousand-Li Ancient Silk Road
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi News: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has had a bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons. The fresh cocoons spun by more than 80,000 boxes of spring silkworms will greatly exceed the original planned output of more than 3.7 million jin.
    This year, the vast majority of spring silkworms were raised by agricultural production cooperatives. Due to the agricultural cooperatives allocating a large amount of labor and increasing equipment, and improving silkworm breeding techniques, a general bumper harvest of cocoons was achieved. In the famous silk-producing areas of Hotan and Moyu, the average fresh cocoons spun per box of silkworms reached about 50 jin, an increase of more than 10 jin compared to last year. In the newly developed silkworm breeding areas of the Turpan Basin and oases such as Aksu and Korla, the fresh cocoons also exceeded the original planned output.
    This year, the Autonomous Region's silkworm breeding industry has expanded from ten counties last year to twenty-nine counties. Counties such as Ruoqiang, Qiemo, and Minfeng on the southern edge of the Tarim Desert have all successfully conducted trial breeding. On the ancient "Silk Road" stretching about two thousand li from Ruoqiang to Shache, all counties now have sericulture.

    两千里古代丝道上
    新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区蚕茧丰收，八万多盒春蚕结的鲜茧，将大大超过三百七十多万斤的原订计划。
    今年绝大部分春蚕都是农业生产合作社饲养的。由于农业社抽出大量劳动力和增加设备，提高了养蚕技术，获得蚕茧普遍丰收。著名的蚕丝产地和阗、墨玉一带，今年每盒蚕结的鲜茧平均达到五十斤左右，比去年增加了十斤多。今年新开辟的养蚕区吐鲁番盆地和阿克苏、库尔勒等绿洲，鲜茧也超过了原订的计划产量。
    今年，自治区养蚕业从去年的十个县扩展到二十九个县。塔里木大沙漠南缘的婼羌、且末、民丰等县都试养成功，从婼羌到莎车约两千里的古代“丝道”上，现在县县都有了蚕桑业。
