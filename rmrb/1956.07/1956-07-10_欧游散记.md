    "Homage to France"
    "Homage to France," sponsored by the American and French governments and organized by many official and semi-official American groups, includes art exhibitions, the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, the New York Metropolitan Ballet, and many other projects. The New York Metropolitan Ballet is one of the world's most famous ballet companies, and we couldn't miss the opportunity to see their performance.
    We watched four short pieces, of which Delibes' "Sylvia" and Copland's "Clarinet Concerto" formed a wonderful contrast.
    In the former, the two soloists, Maria Tallchief and André Eglevsky, demonstrated the excellent technical traditions of the Russian ballet school. But the performance of the latter work by an American composer was a complete paradigm of modernist artistic creation. The originally very talented actors became puppets, and the so-called attempts to break traditional constraints turned the dancers' bodies into unnatural, distorted shapes. The choreographer used dance as an abstract interpretation of the music, turning the entire dance into a change of composition and formation, without content or character. When expressing the strong rhythm at the end of the music, the choreographer had dozens of female dancers lying on the stage, wriggling their bellies up and down with the rhythm of the music.
    American Goods and West German Goods
    There are many cars in Paris, and among them, many are American-made and West German-made. American cars are characterized by their novel styles, while West German cars are durable and sturdy. What they have in common is that they are very cheap, some even cheaper than French goods in France. As for West Germany's traditional export goods, such as photographic equipment, there is no need to say more. For example, for photographic flash bulbs, West German products are much lighter than French products, and the price is more than a third cheaper. Therefore, some French goods must compete with foreign counterparts in the domestic market. It is no wonder that many French businessmen naturally show dissatisfaction and unease when they mention these two powerful rivals from different directions in the international market after the war.
    Not to mention valuable goods. In department stores in Paris, American ballpoint pens (the so-called "atomic pen" that the American swindler Reynolds once "patented") are also the cheapest brand. A brand called "American Brand" costs only fifty francs per pen, and the famous "Reynolds Brand" only sells for one hundred francs. Even these "worthless" goods showed "free competition."
    Some enterprises are already internationalized trusts. For example, the famous French Pathé company is now called "Pathé-Marconi." Mr. Bourgeois, the general manager of this company, showed great kindness to the Chinese Art Troupe, and once held a grand reception on the Eiffel Tower for the publication of "Peking Opera" records, so that the next day's newspaper said: "The reception celebrating the publication of Peking Opera records was also attended by a crowd of ambassadors and ministers." After the reception, Mr. Bourgeois invited us to tour the Eiffel Tower, and at dinner, he seemed to reveal a secret to an old friend: "Do you know what 'Pathé-Marconi' is? This is the company called 'Victor' in England, 'Columbia' in the United States, and 'Pathé-Marconi' in France."

    “向法兰西致敬”
    美国和法国政府赞助的，美国许多官方和半官方团体主办的“向法兰西致敬”，包括有艺术展览会、费城交响乐队、纽约都会舞剧院等许多项目。纽约都会舞剧院是世界著名的舞剧院之一，我们不能放过欣赏他们演出的这个机会。
    我们看了四个小节目，其中德利伯的“西尔维亚”和考普兰的“竖笛竞奏乐”形成了绝妙的对比。
    前一个节目，两个独舞家玛丽亚·泰尔契夫和安德烈·埃格列夫斯基表现了优秀的俄罗斯舞剧学派的技巧传统。但美国作曲家的后一个作品的演出，便完全是那种现代主义的艺术创作的典范了。原本很有才能的演员们变成了木偶，所谓企图打破传统约束的动作使舞蹈家的躯体变成不自然的扭曲形状。编舞者把音乐用舞蹈作抽象的解释，使整个舞蹈变成构图和队形的变化，没有内容也没有人物性格。当表现音乐结尾时的强烈节奏时，编舞者使好几十个女舞蹈家躺在舞台上，用肚子随着音乐的节奏上下扭动。
    美国货和西德货
    巴黎的汽车多，而其中美国造的和西德造的也很多。美国车以式样新颖为特点，而西德车则坚固耐用。相同的是价钱都很便宜，有些甚至比在法国的法国货还便宜一些。至于西德的传统出口货如照像用品等就更不必说了，比如照像用的万次闪光灯，西德的出品比法国的出品要轻便很多，而价钱又便宜三分之一以上。所以，有些法国货物在国内市场上也要和外国的同行竞争。这也难怪许多法国商人一提起战后在国际市场上的这两个来自不同方向的劲敌，很自然的总是表现出不满和不安了。
    不要说值钱的货色。在巴黎的百货公司中，美国的圆珠笔（就是美国的大骗子雷诺曾经“专利”的所谓“原子笔”），也是最便宜的牌子。一种叫“美国牌”的牌子才五十法郎一支，大名鼎鼎的“雷诺牌”也才卖一百法郎。连这种“不值甚么”的货物也表现出了“自由竞争”。
    有些企业已经是国际的托拉斯化的大企业了。比如有名的法国百代公司，现在叫“百代——马提尼”。这家公司的总经理布尔乔亚先生对中国艺术团表示了很大的好意，并曾经在铁塔上为“京戏”唱片的出版举行过一个盛大的酒会，以致第二天的报纸上说：“庆祝京戏唱片出版的酒会上，也出席了成群的大使和公使们”。在酒会后，布尔乔亚先生招待我们游览铁塔，在晚餐时他好像对一个老朋友泄露一件秘密似的告诉我：“你知道什么是‘百代——马提尼’么？这就是在英国叫‘胜利’，在美国叫‘哥伦比亚’，在法国叫‘百代——马提尼’的公司”。
