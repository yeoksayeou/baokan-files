    Should Treat Everyone Equally
    To the Editor:
    In some agencies in our province, the so-called "old personnel" problem still exists. Some comrades, including a few leading cadres, still hold a discriminatory attitude towards these "old personnel." There are even cadres who, upon seeing them work hard, say they are "faking activity"; upon seeing them being cautious, say they are "doing their job as monks striking the bell"; upon seeing them speak actively at meetings, say they are "talking pretty words"; upon seeing them not daring to speak, say they are "ideologically backward"; upon seeing some of them wanting to join the Party, satirize them as "toads wanting to eat swan meat." In short, no matter how they perform, these comrades find them "unpleasant." As for their political distress and demands, they are even "beneath their notice" to inquire about.
    For them, there are not many who openly call them "old personnel" now, but it is often heard behind their backs. I think it is completely wrong to discriminate against and even attack these people, and they should be treated equally. Those among them who are both virtuous and talented should also be promoted; those who meet the requirements for Party membership can also be accepted into the Party. At the same time, I also hope that these so-called "old personnel" comrades will not be inferior because they once worked in the old regime's organs, and should boldly and creatively carry out their work, emitting their own heat in the labor of building our motherland!

### 理应一视同仁

    理应一视同仁编辑同志：
    在我们省的一些机关里，还存在着所谓“旧人员”问题。一些同志包括少数领导干部，对这些“旧人员”还抱着歧视的态度。甚至还有这样的干部，看到他们努力工作，就说是“假积极”；看到他们小手小脚，就说是“做一天和尚撞一天钟”；看到他们在会上积极发言，就说是“说漂亮话”；看到他们不敢发言，就说是“思想落后”；看到他们中有的人想要求入党，就讽刺说是“癞蛤蟆想上天”。总之，不管他们表现怎样，这些同志都觉得“不顺眼”。至于他们在政治上有什么苦闷和要求，那就更加“不屑于”过问了。
    对于他们，现在公开叫“旧人员”的已经不多了，但背后这样叫的还时常听见。我以为歧视以致打击这些人是完全错误的，应该对他们一视同仁。他们当中才德兼备的也应该提拔；具备党员条件的，也可以接收入党。同时我也希望这些所谓“旧人员”同志不要因为自己曾在旧政权机关做过事而自卑，应该大胆地创造性地进行工作，在建设我们祖国的劳动中发出自己的一分热来！　　冯　俊
