Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Jiaotong University held a national examination starting on the 4th. The first to be examined were Chen Yixin and Xu Chuanxiang, the first graduates of the Chinese Electrical Insulation and Cable Technology program. Both of them received "Excellent" ratings.
    The National Examination Committee was composed of the deputy director and engineers of the state-owned Shanghai Wire Factory, as well as professors and lecturers from Jiaotong University. The Examination Committee reviewed the graduation designs submitted by the examinees, and the examinees defended them on the spot.
    Chen Yixin and Xu Chuanxiang respectively submitted designs for a power cable workshop and a communication cable workshop. These included the manufacture of 35 kV high-voltage power cables and high-frequency communication cables capable of simultaneously handling 24 long-distance telephone calls, as well as several types of cables that will only begin to be manufactured in China's Second Five-Year Plan. These were designed by them, under the guidance of teachers, based on their production internships in factories and the latest Soviet materials.
    After reviewing their graduation designs, the National Examination Committee believed that they had demonstrated independent thinking ability in these two graduation designs, that their explanations and calculations were relatively accurate and detailed, and that they had paid attention to economy. Some of the designs are worth referencing by actual production units. The National Examination Committee also expressed satisfaction with the examinees' answers to more than a dozen questions on the spot, believing that the two examinees had successfully mastered the requirements of engineer work.
    Jiaotong University is conducting national examinations on a trial basis for thirteen majors this year, with a total of more than 530 students being examined.

    交通大学举行国家考试
    新华社讯　交通大学四日开始举行国家考试，第一次受试的是中国电气绝缘与电缆技术专业第一批毕业生陈益新和徐传骧。他们两人都得到了“优等”评分。
    这次国家考试的考试委员会是由国营上海电线厂的副厂长、工程师和交通大学的教授、讲师组成的。考试委员会审查了受试人提出的毕业设计，并且由受试人当场进行答辩。
    陈益新和徐传骧分别提出的是电力电缆车间和通讯电缆车间两个设计。其中包括有制造三十五千伏高压电力电缆和可以同时由二十四路长途通话的高频率通讯电缆，还有几种在中国第二个五年计划才开始制造的电缆。这是他们在教师指导下，根据在工厂生产实习和苏联最新的资料加以研究以后设计的。
    国家考试委员会审查了他们的毕业设计以后，认为他们在这两个毕业设计中发挥了独立思考的能力，阐述和计算比较准确、细致，而且注意了节约，部分设计值得作为实际生产单位参考。国家考试委员会对于受试人当场对十几个问题的答辩，也表示满意，认为这两个受试人已经成功地掌握了工程师工作的要求。
    交通大学今年有十三个专业试行国家考试，受试的学生共有五百三十多人。
