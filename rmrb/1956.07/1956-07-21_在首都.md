In the Capital

Dear readers, do you know? While you are sound asleep, how many people across the country are working tirelessly through the night for your happy life and tomorrow's work. Look! Here are many people in Beijing working at night on the 18th.

Guarding the Children's Bedsides

A soft light envelops the children's bedroom in the Nanwei Hutong Nursery. The caretakers, wearing white uniforms, gently walk back and forth beside each small bed. Two-and-a-half-year-old Zeng Shanshan crumples her white quilt into a ball in her sleep, hugging it like a doll. Caretaker Fang Li gently loosened her little hand and covered her with the quilt again. Some of the sleeping children have their little legs propped on the bed rails, some have their little hands hanging over the edge of the bed, and some are sleeping on their stomachs. The caretakers correct these less comfortable positions to make the children sleep more comfortably.

At more than two o'clock in the morning, caretaker Song Zuofang noticed that one-and-a-half-year-old boy Kang Honglu had soiled his clothes. She immediately and carefully changed his dirty clothes for him, without waking the child. Song Zuofang made a note in the book recording the children's living conditions: "Kang Honglu had a bowel movement once at night, indicating poor digestion. Please ask the daytime aunties to pay attention to his diet. The other children are sleeping well."

For Tomorrow's Passengers

After sending the last batch of passengers home to rest at night, the maintenance workers, dispatchers, drivers, conductors... of the Beijing Tram Company and Bus Company are still working hard. Some of them are repairing the vehicles returning to the depot, and some are collecting cleaning supplies such as rags and kettles from the vehicles, preparing to clean them. Wan Shijun, the dispatcher of the First Maintenance Plant of the Tram Company, is registering the lost items left behind by passengers collected by the conductors from the vehicles: fans, umbrellas, handkerchiefs..., preparing to post a lost and found notice tomorrow.

Before two o'clock in the morning, the bus dispatcher had already allocated hundreds of buses on 25 routes in the city and to the suburbs. The bus drivers and conductors are already waiting on various streets. At three o'clock, they take the shift-change bus to the maintenance plant, preparing to depart at 4:30 to send people to work and study. Zhang Xien, the workshop director of the maintenance plant who has been working at night for four years, said that working at night is hard, but when we know that there have been no mechanical failures all day, happiness replaces everything.

Dawn's Telegram

At 4:27, the Beijing Telegraph Bureau received a telegram from Xu Xie, a sender from Ziyang, Shandong, submitted at 4:00. This telegram was translated in eleven minutes, handed over to the deliveryman, and delivered to Beijing No. 26 Middle School at 4:50. The recipient, Xu Jun, was overjoyed when he opened the telegram, saying, "This is great!" It turned out that he had been to the station for three consecutive days to pick up his eight-year-old sister, but had not been able to. The telegram read: "Pick up sister at 4 p.m. today."

This is one of many telegrams that night. If you didn't walk through the quiet East Chang'an Street and into the brightly lit, open-door Beijing Telegraph Bureau, you would really forget that it was already after midnight. The clerks are still at the counters, waiting for people to send telegrams at any time. The teleprinters in the telegraph room are clattering, and the telegraph operators are concentrating on receiving and sending telegrams. The conveyor belt delivers the received telegrams one after another to the incoming telegram room for translation, and the deliverymen are always ready to depart.

Delivering a Baby at 0:28

Wang Zhi, a 64-year-old service worker at the admissions office of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, has been working the night shift for 22 years. On the night of the 18th, when he finished the admission procedures for the pregnant woman Zhang Meide, he judged like an experienced doctor: you will definitely give birth tonight.

In the delivery room, five or six on-duty doctors and midwives took turns guarding Zhang Meide, listening to the fetal heartbeat from time to time. They said to the pregnant woman: "Don't worry, the baby is fine!"

At 0:28, the baby was born with a "wa" sound. The midwife carefully tied the umbilical cord and wiped the slightly red little body. When the young mother saw her chubby son, a happy smile appeared on her face.

When the pregnant woman Zhang Meide was drinking brown sugar tea, the doctor said kindly to her, "Have a good sleep. At dawn, we will call the child's father to tell him that both the mother and baby are doing well!"

Transporting Vegetables All Night

When dawn was approaching, the employees of the vegetable markets and non-staple food stores had already finished their all-night work, preparing more than two million catties of vegetables to supply the people of the capital.

In the largest Guang'anmen Vegetable Station in the city, members of the suburban agricultural production cooperatives came driving horse-drawn carts loaded with vegetables, sending the fresh vegetables picked from the fields into the city overnight. The famous Si Ji Qing, Dong Fang Hong and other agricultural production cooperatives have a bumper harvest of vegetables this year. Day and night, you can see their vegetable carts here. The purchasing staff of the vegetable station often work from late night to day, receiving more than a hundred carts of vegetables at a time. At five or six o'clock in the morning, the traders wholesale and transport simultaneously to about nine hundred retail outlets and government organizations. Every night, the twenty-one vegetable stations in the city are working just as intensely.

Sweeping the Entire City

In the middle of the night, more than one hundred vehicles driven by sanitation workers travel through the streets and alleys of the city, transporting more than two thousand cubic meters of garbage from the eight thousand garbage collection stations to the seven garbage disposal sites outside the city.

At this time, five large sprinkler trucks wash away the dust on the wide East and West Chang'an Streets. Four hundred street sweepers are cleaning more than two hundred streets such as Wangfujing and Nanheyan.

As the east brightens, more than twenty sprinkler trucks appear on the streets again. People walk on these clean, moist asphalt roads to their work and study posts.

For Millions of Readers

At midnight, the lights in Wangfujing Street are all out, but the lights in many rooms of the People's Daily building are still on. On the third floor, the telephone in the night shift editorial team rings constantly, often interrupting the editors' thoughts as they rush to compile the last few important news items. Suddenly, reporters stationed in Yunnan, Anhui and other places sent urgent manuscripts by telegram, but it was already past the 12:00 deadline, so they had to reluctantly cut these news items. It was after one o'clock, and the editors took the painstakingly designed page layouts to the typesetting workshop. The workers began to assemble the pages. The climax of the work shifted from the office to the printing workshop. Here, the experienced typesetting workers who are intensely assembling the pages have more than ten years of experience. They are fighting against time. They use very skilled techniques to repeatedly change the typesetting according to the revisions, and strive to send the pages to make paper molds as soon as possible. At the same time, in the inspection team and proofreading team, a group of clear-headed people are carefully checking each manuscript and each word with red pens, striving to eliminate every error in the newspaper.

At 2:59, four high-speed rotary presses started running. A little more than a minute later, the workers rushed to pick up today's newspaper to check the results of their and the editors' all-night work. The post office trucks, filled with the newly released newspapers, were immediately sent to the railway station and all parts of the city.

At the same time, the paper molds of the newspaper were rushed to the Xijiao Airport and sent by special planes and scheduled flights to eight major cities such as Shanghai, Kunming, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Urumqi and Shenyang, so that millions of readers in these places could also see the Beijing People's Daily on the same day.

    在首都
    亲爱的读者，你知道吗？当你们熟睡的时候，全国有多少人为了你们幸福的生活和明天的工作，在通宵紧张地劳动着。看吧！下面就是在十八日夜里北京很多夜间工作着的人们。
    守候在孩子床边
    柔弱的灯光笼罩着南魏胡同托儿所孩子们的卧室。保育员们穿着白色的工作服挨着每个小床轻轻地来回走动。两岁半的女孩子曾珊珊在睡梦里把白色的小被揉作一团，像抱洋娃娃似地把它抱在怀里。保育员房黎轻轻松开了她的小手，又把被子替她盖好。酣睡着的孩子们有的把小腿跷在床栏干上，有的把小手垂在床沿下，有的爬在小床上睡觉。保育员们都把这些不大好的姿势纠正了，使孩子们睡得更舒适。
    深夜两点多钟，保育员宋作芳发觉一岁半的男孩康宏陆大便在衣服上，她立刻细心而又熟练地给它换去了脏衣服，而这个孩子并没有醒。宋作芳在记录孩子生活情况的本子上作了记录：“康宏陆夜间大便一次，发现消化不好，请白班的阿姨注意他的饮食，其它的孩子睡得很好。”
    为了明天的乘客
    夜里把最后一批乘客送回家休息以后，北京市电车公司、汽车公司的检修工人、调度员、司机、售票员……，还在紧张地劳动着。他们中有的在检修回厂的车辆，有的在收集车上的抹布、水壶等清洁用具，准备清洗。电车公司第一保养厂调度员万世俊在登记售票员从车上收集的乘客遗失物：扇子、雨伞、手帕……，准备明天招领。
    深夜两点以前，公共汽车的调度员，已经把市内和通往郊区的二十五路的几百辆汽车调配好了。汽车司机和售票员们已经等候在各个街头，在三点钟他们就乘着接班汽车来到保养场，准备在四点三十分出车把人们送往工作、学习的地点。在夜间工作已经四年的保养场车间主任张锡恩说，夜间工作是辛苦，可是当我们知道一天没出任何机件事故的时候，快乐就代替了一切。
    黎明时的电报
    四点二十七分，北京市电报局报务室收到了一份山东滋阳发报人徐燮四点钟交发来的一份电报，这份电报在十一分钟以后缮译完毕，交给送报员，四点五十分就送到了北京市第二十六中学。收报人徐焌拆开电报喜形于色地说：“这下可好了！”原来他一连三天到车站去接他的八岁的妹妹，都没有接着。这份电报上写着：“今天下午四时接妹。”
    这是这一个夜里很多电报中的一份。如果不是经过了静悄悄的东长安街才走进灯火通明、大门敞开的北京市电报局的话，你真会忘记这时已经是午夜以后了。营业员们依然在柜台里随时等待着交发电报的人。报务室里电传打字机搭搭地响着，报务员们精神贯注地收发着电报。传送带一份接一份地把收来的电报送到来报室缮译，送报员们随时都在准备出发。零点二十八分接婴儿
    北京医学院第一附属医院产院的住院处六十四岁的服务员王志，已经上了二十二年夜班了。十八日夜里他在给产妇张美德办完住院手续的时候，像一个有经验的大夫一样地判断说：今晚你一定会生的。
    在产房里，五、六个值班大夫和助产士轮流在张美德旁边守护，不时地听听胎心的跳动，她们对产妇说：“你放心，孩子顶好！”
    零点二十八分，婴儿“哇”地一声诞生了。助产士小心地扎好了脐带，擦好微红的小身体，当年轻的妈妈看到自己胖胖的儿子后，脸上露出了幸福的微笑。
    当产妇张美德正在喝红糖茶的时候，大夫亲切地对她说，“好好地睡觉吧，天明我们就给孩子的爸爸打电话告诉他，大人、婴儿都很好！”
    通宵运蔬菜
    当天快亮的时候，菜市场和副食店的营业员们已经结束通宵的劳动，把供给首都人民的二百多万斤蔬菜准备好了。
    在全市最大的广安门菜站，郊区农业生产合作社社员赶着满载蔬菜的马车来了，他们把刚从田地上摘割下的新鲜蔬菜连夜送进城来。著名的四季青、东方红等农业生产合作社今年蔬菜丰收了，白天黑夜在这里都能看到他们送菜的马车。菜站的收购人员经常从深夜忙到白天，一收就是一百多车菜。早晨五、六点钟，交易员就同时向九百个左右的零销点和机关团体批发调运。全市二十一个菜站每个夜晚也都是这样的紧张地劳动着。
      洒扫全城
    深夜，清洁工人们驾驶的一百多辆汽车，穿行在全城的大街小巷，把八千多个垃圾集中站里的两千多公方垃圾，运到城外七个垃圾处理场。
    在这个时候，五辆大型的洒水车在宽阔的东，西长安街上，冲刷灰尘。四百个扫街工人，在打扫着王府井，南河沿等二百多条街道。
    东方发亮，各条街道上又出现了二十多辆洒水汽车。人们通过这些干净，湿润的柏油马路，走向他们工作，学习的岗位。
  为了千百万读者
    午夜的王府井大街上万家灯火都熄了，人民日报社大楼许多房间里依然灯光通明。三楼上夜班编辑组的电话铃不断地响，经常打断了编辑们赶编最后几条重要消息的思考。忽然，驻在云南、安徽等地记者用电报发来了急稿，但是已经过了十二时的截稿时间，只好把这些消息割爱。一点多钟了，编辑们带着苦心设计出来的版面样跑到排字车间。工人们开始拼版了。工作的高潮由办公室卷向印刷车间。这里，在紧张拼版的老排字工人都有十多年的工龄，他们正在和时间战斗。他们用了十分熟练的技术，根据改稿三番五次地改换排字，也争取尽早把版送去打纸型。同时，在检查组和校对组里，一批头脑清醒的人们，正在拿着红笔细心核对每篇稿件和每一个字，他们为消灭报纸上的每一个错误而努力。
    两点五十九分，四部高速度轮转机转动了。一分多钟后，工人们争先拿起了今天的报纸，检验自己和编辑们彻夜劳动的成果。邮政局的汽车从这里装满了新出的报纸，立即送到火车站和全市去。
    和这同时，报纸的纸型又赶送到西郊飞机场，由专机和班机送往上海、昆明、重庆、兰州、乌鲁木齐和沈阳等八大城市，让这些地方的千百万读者也能当天看到北京的人民日报。
