China's Economic and Trade Relations with Pakistan
Zhang Jun

The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a newly emerging independent nation. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, trade relations between China and Pakistan have developed greatly on a new basis.

Since 1950, the average annual trade volume between China and Pakistan has exceeded 30 million US dollars, occupying an important position in the foreign trade of both countries. In particular, the trade volume has grown rapidly since the Asian-African Conference. The trade volume in 1954 increased by 170% compared to 1953, and increased by 39% in 1955 compared to 1954.

In recent years, there have been extensive contacts between the industrial and commercial circles of China and Pakistan. By the first half of this year, China's import and export corporations maintained regular business contacts with more than 400 manufacturers in Pakistan. Relevant import and export corporations in China have successively signed trade contracts with the Pakistani government and industrial and commercial circles regarding the import of cotton and jute, and the export of coal, and have earnestly implemented them. In 1951 and 1955, China participated twice in the international industrial expositions held in Pakistan. China's exhibits were appreciated and loved by the broad masses of the Pakistani people. During the exhibition, the Chinese exhibition delegation also had extensive contacts with the Pakistani industrial and commercial circles. These frequent contacts and exchanges will inevitably strengthen mutual understanding and promote the development of Sino-Pakistani trade relations.

Cotton and jute are Pakistan's major export commodities, accounting for about 80% of Pakistan's total annual exports, and are of extreme importance to Pakistan's national economy. In recent years, due to the United States' low-priced dumping of large quantities of surplus cotton on the world market, the sales of Pakistani cotton in the international market have become very unstable, and export trade has declined year by year. Pakistan's export volume in the 1954-55 fiscal year was only 1.2 billion rupees, a decrease of half compared to the export volume of 2.5 billion rupees in the 1950-51 fiscal year. Imports have also dropped sharply, from 1.6 billion rupees in the 1950-51 fiscal year to 1.1 billion rupees in the 1954-55 fiscal year. In contrast, China has purchased a large amount of Pakistani cotton in recent years, making it one of the main markets for Pakistani cotton exports. As of June of this year, China has purchased a total of 200,000 metric tons of Pakistani cotton in more than seven years, worth 181.19 million US dollars. The annual purchase volume has remained above 16,000 metric tons each year, except for a slight decrease in 1953 due to larger purchases in the previous year. Since 1955, China has also started to purchase large quantities of jute from Pakistan. Undoubtedly, China's large-scale purchase of cotton and jute from Pakistan not only meets the needs of China's industrial raw materials, but also greatly benefits the Pakistani economy.

However, due to the fact that the existing trade relations between the two countries are not based on national agreements, the trade relations between the two countries have not yet been developed more healthily. This is mainly manifested in the fact that Pakistan purchases very few goods from China each year, which cannot but affect the further development of trade between the two countries. The "Pakistan Times" commented on Sino-Pakistani trade on October 8, 1955: "China still has to pay a large amount of pounds for purchasing Pakistani cotton. If this unbalanced trade continues, it will force China to purchase cotton from other countries. It is recommended that Pakistan sign a long-term bilateral trade agreement with China to ensure the realization of Pakistani cotton prices and increased production plans."

In the first half of this year, China continued to purchase large quantities of cotton and jute from Pakistan. At the same time, due to the positive attitude of the Pakistani government and industrial and commercial circles towards trade with China, China's exports to Pakistan have also begun to increase. The Chinese government has successively signed two coal contracts with the Pakistani government, under which China will supply Pakistan with 425,000 metric tons of coal at reasonable prices. In July of this year, the two governments also signed an agreement on China supplying Pakistan with 60,000 metric tons of rice at fair and reasonable prices, and agreed that the Pakistani side would pay in Pakistani rupees. In addition, 4,000 metric tons of rice were donated to the Pakistani government to help overcome the food shortage in East Pakistan. In addition, the variety of China's exports to Pakistan is also increasing. Pakistani industrialists and businessmen have requested to purchase steel, pig iron, asphalt, newsprint, looms, match factory equipment, and fishing equipment from China. It can be seen that the imbalance of trade between China and Pakistan has been somewhat improved. How to make the trade between the two countries develop more healthily has become a matter of concern to everyone.

There are indeed many favorable factors for China and Pakistan to further expand trade relations. China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors, and the people of both countries have a common desire to maintain peace and develop their own independent economies. In recent years, with the increasing friendly relations between the people of the two countries, the call for expanding Sino-Pakistani trade has become increasingly louder. For example, Abdul Hai, a member of the East Bengal Provincial Assembly, pointed out in an article entitled "Sino-Pakistani Friendship" in the Pakistan Observer on April 13 this year: China and Pakistan should develop economic and cultural relations, and hope that economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries will continue to increase. When Chinese commodities were exhibited in Pakistan in 1955, a textile factory manager wrote on the guestbook: "Chinese products are too fascinating. We hope that Chinese-made machines, fabrics, and other products can come to the Pakistani market."

China and Pakistan are both rich in resources, and are both carrying out large-scale economic construction. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives in both countries, the types and amounts of commodities that can be exchanged between the two countries will gradually expand and increase. Since the implementation of China's First Five-Year Plan, its economic situation has undergone tremendous changes. It can not only export agricultural products, local products, handicrafts, daily necessities, and light industrial products, but also export steel, machinery, lathes, etc., which could not be exported in the past. At the same time, China can also supply complete sets of equipment for many light industrial factories. Pakistani cotton and jute are also well-known to China's cotton and linen textile industry and are readily adopted by them. It is very clear that the development of trade between the two countries has broad prospects.

If trade between China and Pakistan can be consolidated and developed on the existing basis in accordance with the resolution on economic cooperation of the Asian-African Conference, it will be of great significance for strengthening the friendly cooperation between the people of the two countries, promoting the economic prosperity of the Asian-African region, and consolidating Asian and international peace.

    我国同巴基斯坦的经济贸易关系
    张俊
    巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国是一个新兴的独立国家。中华人民共和国成立以来，中巴两国间的贸易关系已在新的基础上取得很大发展。
    自1950年以来，我国同巴基斯坦的贸易额平均每年达三千万美元以上，在我国和巴基斯坦的对外贸易中均占重要地位。特别是亚非会议以后贸易额增长很快，1954年的贸易额比1953年增加170％，1955年比1954年又增加39％。
    几年来我国同巴基斯坦工商界有了广泛的接触，到今年上半年，我国各进出口公司和巴基斯坦四百余家厂商保持着经常的业务联系，我国有关进出口公司先后与巴基斯坦政府和工商界签订了关于棉花、黄麻进口和煤炭出口等贸易合同，并已认真贯彻执行。1951年和1955年我国曾两次参加了在巴基斯坦举行的国际工业博览会。我国展品受到巴基斯坦广大人民的赞赏和喜爱。在展出期间，我国展览团还和巴基斯坦工商界进行了广泛的接触。这些频繁的接触和往来，必然会加强彼此间的进一步了解，促进中巴贸易关系的发展。
    棉花和黄麻是巴基斯坦的大宗出口物资，这两种商品占巴基斯坦全年出口总额的80％左右，对巴基斯坦的国民经济具有极端重要的意义。近年来由于美国将大量剩余棉花向世界市场低价倾销，使巴基斯坦棉花在国际市场的销售显得很不稳定，出口贸易也随之逐年下降。巴基斯坦1954—55年度的出口额仅十二亿卢比，比1950—51年度的出口额二十五亿卢比减少一半。进口方面也激剧下降，由1950—51年度的十六亿卢比，下降为1954—55年度的十一亿卢比。与此相反，我国几年来购买了为数很大的巴基斯坦棉花，为巴基斯坦棉花外销的主要市场之一，到今年六月份为止，我国在七年多时间共购买巴基斯坦棉花计达二十万公吨，共值18，119万美元，每年购买的数量除1953年因上年度购买较多而略有减少外，每年均保持在1.6万公吨以上。我国自1955年开始还向巴基斯坦大量购买黄麻。毫无疑问，我国向巴基斯坦大量购买棉花和黄麻，一方面是满足我国工业原料的需要，另一方面对巴基斯坦的经济是有很大好处的。
    但是由于两国间现存的贸易关系，还不是建筑在国家协定的基础上，致使两国贸易关系还未得到更健康的发展。这主要表现在巴基斯坦每年向中国购买的货物很少，这就不能不影响两国贸易的进一步开展。“巴基斯坦时报”1955年10月8日评论中巴贸易说：“中国购买巴基斯坦棉花仍要支付大量英镑，若这种不平衡贸易继续下去，将迫使中国向别国购棉，建议巴基斯坦与中国签订长期的双边贸易协定，以保证巴棉价格和增产计划的实现。”
    今年上半年，我国向巴基斯坦仍然继续购买了大量的棉花、黄麻，同时由于巴基斯坦政府和工商界对我国贸易采取积极的态度，所以我国对巴基斯坦出口也在开始增加。我国政府已先后与巴基斯坦政府签订了二次煤炭合同，共由我国以合理价格供给巴基斯坦煤炭四十二万五千吨。今年七月两国政府又签订了关于我国以公平合理的价格供应巴基斯坦六万公吨大米的协定，并同意巴方用巴基斯坦卢比支付。另外又赠送给巴基斯坦政府大米四千公吨，帮助克服东巴基斯坦粮荒。此外，我国向巴基斯坦出口的品种也在增加，巴基斯坦工商业家向我国提出购买钢材、生铁、沥青、新闻纸、织布机、火柴厂设备和捕鱼设备等，可以看出中巴两国间贸易不平衡的情况已有若干改进，如何使两国贸易更健康的发展，已成为大家所关心的问题。
    我国同巴基斯坦进一步扩大贸易关系，确实存在着许多有利因素。我国同巴基斯坦是友好邻邦，两国人民都具有维护和平和发展自己国家独立经济的共同愿望。近年来随着两国人民友好关系的日益增进，要求扩大中巴贸易的呼声已日益响亮。如东孟加拉省议员阿布杜尔·海伊曾于今年四月十三日在巴基斯坦观察家报以“中巴友好”为题的文章中指出：中巴应发展经济文化关系，希望两国的经济和文化合作将继续增加。1955年我国商品在巴基斯坦展览时，有一位纺织厂经理在留言薄上写着：“中国的东西太迷人了，我们希望中国制造的机器、布以及其他东西都能到巴基斯坦市场来。”
    我国同巴基斯坦的物产都很丰富，并且正都在进行大规模的经济建设。随着两国工农业生产的迅速发展和人民生活的改善，两国可以交换的商品种类和数额将逐渐扩大和增加。我国自第一个五年计划执行以来，经济状况已发生巨大变化，不仅能出口农产品、土产品、手工艺品、日用百货及轻工业品，而且可以出口过去不能出口的钢材、机械、车床等。同时，我国还可以供应很多轻工业工厂的成套装备。巴基斯坦的棉花、黄麻等也为我国棉麻纺织工业界所熟知，并为他们所乐于采用。非常明显，发展两国间的贸易有着广阔的前途。
    我国同巴基斯坦的贸易能按照亚非会议关于经济合作的决议，在现有的基础上巩固地得到发展，对密切两国人民的友好合作，促进亚非区域的经济繁荣和巩固亚洲和国际和平都有很大意义。
