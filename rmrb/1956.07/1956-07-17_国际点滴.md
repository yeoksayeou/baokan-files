　　　　Lesson
　　The June 29th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" reported the "Iceland incident" on its "World Telegram" page as follows:
　　“In the past three years, the United States has spent $44 million on bases in Iceland.
　　“Result: Only a few Icelanders benefited, and most did not. And even before the election, the Icelandic Parliament was saying 'Yankee, go home.'
　　“The lesson the United States should learn: When giving a large amount of money to a small country, if the money is not spent carefully, it will create enemies even among the 155,000 Icelanders.”
　　It seems that these dollar worshippers have not learned a real lesson from the Iceland incident.

　　　　Three Hundred and Sixty-First Profession
　　In the United States, there is a new profession called "Woman Broker." As the name suggests, this broker specializes in women's business. Women who make a living by selling their beauty look for this kind of broker, and bosses who need to show women's thighs also look for this kind of broker, so the broker can profit.
　　It is said that the busiest "Woman Broker" on Broadway is named Bennett, and he often carries a roster of two thousand women with him so that he can introduce them to take vulgar advertising photos or perform as models, etc.

　　　　American People Reduce Clothing Consumption
　　The June issue of "U.S. News & World Report" said that the slump in the American textile industry has reached its lowest level in 40 years. From 1954 to 1955 alone, 200 textile mills closed. The magazine said that one of the main reasons for the textile industry's downturn is that the American people have sharply reduced their clothing consumption. According to a survey, men buy a new suit on average every three years, and women sew a new dress every four years. Textile companies have found an explanation for this decline in consumption, saying that it is because the American people have recently stopped paying attention to high-quality clothing and prefer to wear simple casual clothes. Therefore, some so-called apparel associations of textile companies have donated $2 million to launch a campaign to encourage the American people to pay more attention to clothing.

    国际点滴
          教　训
    六月二十九日“美国新闻与世界报道”在“世界电讯”版上对“冰岛事件”作了这样的报道：
    “在过去三年中，美国在冰岛基地上已花了四千四百万美元。
    “结果：只有几个冰岛人获利而大多数人都没有得到利益。并且甚至在选举前，冰岛议会也在说‘美国佬，滚回去’。
    “美国应得的教训：把大批钱给一个小国时，如果花钱不小心，即使在十五万五千的冰岛人中也会制造出敌人。”
    看来，这些美元至上者并没有从冰岛事件上获得真正的教训。
    第三百六十一行
    在美国有一门新行业叫做“女人经纪”。顾名思义，这位经纪人是专门做女人生意的。靠出卖色相混饭吃的女子找这种经纪人，而需要表演女人大腿的老板们也找这种经纪人，于是经纪人就有利可图了。
    据说在百老汇有个最忙的“女人经纪”叫柏诺特，他经常随身带着两千名女子的名册，以便随时介绍她们去拍下流的广告照片或表演模特儿等等。
    美国人民减少衣著消费
    六月份一期“美国新闻与世界报道”说，美国纺织工业的萧条情况已达四十年来最低的水平，仅1954—55年，就有二百家纺织厂关闭。这家杂志说，纺织工业不景气的主要原因之一，就是美国人民衣著消费锐减，据调查，男人平均每三年才添一套衣服，而妇女四年才缝一身新装。纺织公司为这种消费水平下降的现象找到了一种解释，据说，这是由于美国人民近来不注重上等衣著而喜欢穿简单的便装的缘故。因此，纺织公司的一些所谓服装协会已捐出二百万美元，准备开展一项鼓励美国人民多注意衣著的运动。
