Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th: The government of the German Democratic Republic and the National Front of Democratic Germany jointly issued a statement on the 11th, calling on West German youth to come to Democratic Germany to escape the conscription threat from the Bonn government.

The statement said: The government of Democratic Germany will provide all support to threatened youth, enabling them to serve the country's peaceful construction work. The government of Democratic Germany has decided not to conscript soldiers. All West German youth are welcome to come here and personally verify that Democratic Germany is the homeland of German youth.

The statement also expressed the hope that those young people who have left Democratic Germany for various reasons and are currently threatened with conscription will return and work for their peaceful future.

The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League and the Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation also issued statements, calling on all German youth and trade union members to unite against conscription in West Germany, and welcomed West German youth who refused to serve in the North Atlantic Group to come to Democratic Germany to engage in peaceful labor.

At the same time, many factories in Democratic Germany wrote letters to factories in West Germany, guaranteeing that all young people who came to Democratic Germany would be able to find work.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th: Since the West German Federal Parliament passed the conscription bill, more and more young men of conscription age have fled from West Germany to Democratic Germany.

The Potsdam reception station recently received thirteen West German youths, all of whom stated that they were unwilling to serve in the West German Defense Forces, which are being established, and were willing to live and work in Democratic Germany.

A large number of West German youths also arrived at the Eisenach reception station. One of them, a twenty-year-old named Steirzemuller from Wuppertal, West Germany, said in response to the question of why he ran over: "I want to study and work. In my opinion, this is better than shooting a gun, so I chose a good Germany."

Recently, the West German police have taken terrorist measures in an attempt to prevent West German youth from escaping, but a large number of young people are still fleeing to Democratic Germany. In June, 1,365 West German youths requested asylum in the Democratic sector of Berlin. Two hundred and fifty people requested asylum in Schwerin.

    西德青年投奔民主德国逃避兵役
    德意志民主共和国政府保证给予帮助
    新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国政府和民主德国全国阵线十一日发表联合声明，号召西德青年到民主德国来逃避波恩政府的征兵威胁。
    声明说：民主德国政府对于受威胁的青年将给予一切支援，使他们可以为祖国的和平建设工作服务。民主德国政府已经决定不征兵。欢迎所有西德青年到这里来亲自证实民主德国是德国青年的祖国。
    声明同时表示希望那些由于各种原因离开民主德国而目前受到征兵威胁的青年回来，为他们的和平前途而工作。
    自由德国青年联盟中央委员会和自由德国工会联合会中央理事会也发表了声明，号召全德国的青年和工会会员联合起来反对在西德征兵，并且欢迎拒绝为北大西洋集团服兵役的西德青年到民主德国来从事和平的劳动。
    同时，民主德国的许多工厂写信给西德的工厂，保证到民主德国来的所有青年都可以得到工作。
    新华社柏林12日电　西德联邦议院通过征兵法案以后，适龄青年从西德逃到民主德国来的越来越多。
    波茨坦收容站最近接待了十三个西德青年，他们都表示不愿意在建立中的西德国防军中服役，而愿意在民主德国生活和工作。
    西德大批青年也到了埃森纳赫收容站。其中有一个从西德窝伯塔尔来的二十岁的青年施泰尔采穆勒在回答他跑过来的原因这个问题的时候说：“我想学习和工作。在我看来，这要比放枪好，因此我选择了一个好的德国。”
    最近以来，西德警察采取恐怖手段，企图阻止西德青年逃亡，但是，仍然有大批青年逃到民主德国来。在六月份，到柏林民主区请求收容的西德青年就有一千三百六十五人。到什未林请求收容的有二百五十人。
