Chongqing, a mountain city, with houses stacked upon houses. It is draped in a thin veil of mist, as beautiful as a painting! Behind it, rise the all-too-familiar mountain peaks and the faint silhouette of trees like lace around them. So familiar, because we once faced each other morning and night! The ship gradually approaches Chaotianmen, then takes a turn into the beautiful Jialing River.

After days of the ship's vibrations, the passengers finally feel it stop shaking. A strange quiet emerges. However, this quiet does not last long. Another vibration is transmitted. My whole body feels this tremor; I have become a plucked string. Ten years, a full ten years, without seeing you! A full ten years without being in your embrace. Now I am back.

A car is already waiting for us at the pier. We pass through a newly opened road, through the Linjiangmen area, speeding forward. I both recognize and don't recognize the streets of Chongqing! Chongqing's streets, how I wish to get out of the car, to linger on the street, to look at you carefully, to touch you. Here we spent the most difficult years of our history. Was it not here that we jumped up in the middle of the night, rudely shaking awake children who were sleeping soundly, oblivious even to the air raid sirens, then shouldering bags, carrying suitcases, stumbling into air raid shelters; was it not here that American soldiers drove recklessly in jeeps, while obsequious Kuomintang lackeys bowed and scraped to them, and the money in our pockets, with which we maintained our lives, was mysteriously stolen away every hour by a strange sorcery? Was it not here that, besides the shadow the sun gave us, the reactionary rulers also gave us an ever-present haunting shadow—we were tormented here, insulted here!

However, there is no need to talk about all that now. You have completely changed, changed so much that the returning traveler does not recognize his own home.

The first evening, friends treated me to a performance at the Chongqing City Sichuan Opera Theater. I was listening to the rising and falling melodies when suddenly, from certain hints on the stage and in the theater, I realized: isn't this the "Youth Hall"? Yes, this is indeed the "Youth Hall" of yesteryear. Memories immediately flooded back. On this stage, someone once recited "Diary of a Madman," Ma Sicong once played his "Sword Dance," a large orchestra once commemorated the elder Romain Rolland with Beethoven's "Eroica," and Mr. Guo Moruo once stood before He Yingqin, who had lost thousands of miles of territory, and berated him for hours. Every time he uttered a harsh word, the audience applauded. Moreover, it was on this very stage, ten years ago, on the eve of the signing of the "Double Tenth Agreement," that Chairman Mao Zedong fervently appealed for peace, saying:

"Harmony is precious."

The next day, I went early in the morning to look for my old residence, not expecting that the site had become a park. Where there used to be a thatched cottage, now stands a tall building. I visited Zhangjia Garden, the wartime writers' association, and could not believe that our writers had lived in such dilapidated, such cramped houses. I looked for Ziwu Village, but could not find it; I looked for Hongqiu Dam, and found that the former vegetable garden was covered with houses, becoming a bustling urban area. I looked for Datianwan, and suddenly found myself back in front of the People's Auditorium, that celestial altar-like structure. Here, a magnificent three-story emerald green dome soars, instantly changing the face of the mountain city.

I searched everywhere, looking for the bricks in front of Cangbai Hall, the bloodstains and tear marks at Jiaochangkou. A female comrade from the museum led us to visit Zengjiayan No. 50. We had listened to political reports downstairs, and watched Yangko dance dramas in the small rooms. But what a strange building this is! The leading comrades of the Chinese Communist Party and Kuomintang secret agents lived under the same roof. On the second floor, next to the bedrooms of Comrades Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, the secret agents occupied five rooms. The struggle back then was so intense; the enemy had wedged themselves into this house. But now, we are standing at the gate of No. 50, taking pictures.

Chongqing, how many things there are to recall, to commemorate! But two days later, the nostalgic mood quickly disappeared. My eyes were filled with new things. On the third day, I felt this mood was a bit outdated. On the fourth day, I myself could hardly bear it!

Sedan chairs are gone. Rickshaws are also nowhere to be seen. Trolleybuses fly across the city, climbing slopes faster than cars. Cable cars go up and down, shuttling between Lianglukou and Caiyuanba. Caiyuanba Station is the end point of forty years of wishes, the starting point of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Now, people are waiting for the good news of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opening to traffic. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway is already under construction, and the two river bridges that will span the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers have begun exploration. The mountain city of Chongqing will also be one of the first cities in our country to build an underground railway, with one line running from Niujiaotuo to Daxigou, and another line running from Caiyuanba to Chaotianmen. Let us quarry marble to build the stations, and name them with the most beautiful names.

Beautiful city! I once departed from Chaotianmen, passed through the prosperous urban area, visited the stadium at Lianglukou, and then went towards Yangjiaping via Daping. The newly built rows of workers' dormitories, the white walls, the green windows, the small flowerbeds in front of the doors, the newly built cinemas. The future of Chongqing is being built here, splitting mountains and filling valleys. We then cut across from this side of the Yangtze River to the side of the Jialing River, and then saw the vast urban area of Shapingba and Ciqikou. One place is an industrial zone, and the other is a light industry and cultural zone.

Great city! A wide riverside dock will embrace this mountain city like a belt. After the Three Gorges Reservoir raises the water level, ten-thousand-ton freighters from Shanghai will be able to berth at this large port with all modern equipment. Surrounding Chongqing Iron and Steel Company will be many machine manufacturing industries. Chongqing is also a large coal industry city. The enormous electricity hidden in the waves of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers will drive these industries.

Rich city! How many fruit trees are facing the sun? How many fruits are weighing down the branches? The Guanggan oranges from last year have not yet been eaten, and this year's are already hanging on the trees! Why is nature so generous to this place? There is no need for greening here; it is green in all seasons. Greening here is just the planned greening: these mountains are Guanggan oranges, those are grapefruits, and so on.

Look, flowers cover the ground, butterflies fill the garden. I don't know if there are more butterflies or more flowers? I don't know if there are more flowers or more butterflies? Look, four fluttering butterflies are vying for the pistil of a passionflower. The climate characteristics of the mountain city make the flowers here more fragrant than anywhere else; this is the location of one of our perfume factories.

At night, standing on the high point of Pipa Mountain Park and looking down, there are hundreds of thousands of lights below. You can use a piece of black paper, pierce countless pinholes in it, and then put it in front of a light to take a look; this is Chongqing at night, and I have returned.

    归来
    徐迟
    山城重庆，重重叠叠的屋宇。它披着一层薄纱似的轻雾，美丽得像在画中一样！在它的背后，耸起了多末熟悉的山峰和山峰上一圈花边似的淡淡的树木剪影。多末熟悉，因为曾经朝夕相对啊！轮船渐渐驶近了朝天门，却又一个拐弯，进入秀丽的嘉陵江。
    一连几天在船身震动之中的乘船人，终于感到船停止它的震抖了。出现了一种奇异的安静。然而，这安静并不长久。另一种震抖传动而来。我全身感到了这震抖，我成了一根被拨动的琴弦。十年，整整十年，没有看见你了！整整十年，没有在你的怀抱中了。现在我回来了。
    一辆车已在码头上等候我们。我们穿过一条新辟的马路，经临江门一带，疾驰前进。我又认得又不认得重庆的街道了！重庆的街道啊，我多末愿意下车来，停留在街头，细细看你，摸你。在这里我们曾度过了我们的历史中最艰苦的年头。难道不是在这里，我们半夜惊跳起来，把睡得香甜，连警报汽笛也唤不醒的孩子粗暴地摇醒，然后掮着包，提着箱，踉跄奔进防空洞；难道不是在这里，美国兵坐在吉普车里横冲直撞，奴颜婢膝的国民党西崽向他们打躬作揖，而我们用以维持生活的，我们口袋里的钱币却每时地被一种奇怪的妖法盗窃了去？难道不是在这里，除了太阳给我们一个影子之外，反动统治者也给了我们一个尾随不舍的魔影——我们在这里被折磨过，被侮辱过！
    然而，现在不用说这一切了。你已经完全变了样，变得使游子归来，都不认识自己的家园了。
    头一天晚上，朋友们招待我去重庆市川剧院看戏。我正听着抑扬的高腔音乐，突然从舞台和剧场的某些暗示中发现了：这可不是“青年馆”吗？是的，这正是当年的“青年馆”。记忆立刻涌了上来。在这台上，有人曾朗诵过“狂人日记”，马思聪曾弹奏过他的“剑舞”，大乐队曾以贝多芬的“英雄”祭奠过罗曼罗兰老人，郭沫若先生曾站在那个失地千里的何应钦面前，痛骂了他几个小时。骂一句，台下鼓一次掌。而且，就是在这台上，十年前，在“双十协定”签订前夕，毛泽东主席曾经大声疾呼地呼吁和平，他说：
    “和为贵”。
    第二天，我一清早就去寻找故居，没有想到所在地已变成一个公园，原来是草堂，现在矗立着一座楼房。我访问了张家花园，战时的作家协会，不能相信我们的作家曾住过这样破烂、这样湫隘的房子。我寻找紫薇村，没有找到，寻找红球坝，发现从前的一片菜园上，布满房屋，成为热闹的市区。我寻找大田湾，突然发现我已回到人民礼堂那天坛似的大建筑物面前了。在这里耸起宏伟的三层翠绿的圆顶，它在一霎那之间改变了山城的面貌。
    我到处寻找，寻找沧白堂前的砖头，较场口的血迹和泪痕。博物馆派来的女同志，带领我们参观曾家岩五十号。我们曾在它的楼下听过政治报告，在小屋中看过秧歌舞剧。可是，这是多末奇怪的一幢房子啊！中国共产党的领导同志和国民党特务同住在一个屋顶下面。在二楼，周恩来和董必武同志的两间卧室之旁，特务占了五个房间。当年的斗争是多末激烈，敌人已楔入到这座房子里来了。可是，现在，我们站在五十号的大门口，照起相来了。
    重庆，有多少可回忆，可纪念的事物啊！可是，两天后，怀旧的心情很快消失。满眼是新事物。第三天，就觉得这种心情有点迂。第四天，我自己也简直不能忍受它了！
    滑竿没有了。人力车也看不见了。电车满城飞，爬坡比起汽车来还快。缆车上上下下，往来于两路口菜园坝之间。菜园坝车站是四十年愿望的终点，成渝路的起点。现在，人们正在等待着宝成路通车的佳音。川黔路已经在兴建之中，将要跨越长江和嘉陵江的两座江桥开始钻探了。山城重庆还将是我国最早修建地下铁道的一座城市，一条地下铁道线从牛角沱通往大溪沟，另一条线从菜园坝通往朝天门。让我们采大理石来修造车站，用最美丽的名字给它们命名。
    美丽的城市啊！我曾从朝天门出发，穿过繁荣的市区，到两路口参观体育馆，然后经过大坪，向着杨家坪而去。新建的一排排的工人宿舍，洁白的墙，绿的窗户，门前的小花圃，新建的电影院。未来的重庆正在这里劈开山头填平山谷，建设起来。我们又从这靠长江的一面横插到嘉陵江的一面去，于是看到了沙坪坝，磁器口的一片巨大的市区。一处是工业区，另一处是轻工业和文化区。
    伟大的城市啊。一条宽阔的沿江码头将要像腰带似的怀抱这座山城。三峡水库将水位提高后，从上海来的万吨大轮船将要泊在这拥有一切现代化设备的大港。围绕着重庆钢铁公司的将是许多机器制造工业。重庆还是一座巨大的煤炭工业之城。蕴藏在长江和嘉陵江水波里的巨大的电力，则将推动这些工业。
    富饶的城市啊！多少果树迎着阳光？多少果实使枝头下垂？去年的广柑还没有吃光，今年的又挂在树上了！为什么大自然对这里如此厚道？这里用不到绿化，四季都是绿的。绿化在这里只是绿的规划化：这几座山是广柑，那几座是柚子等等。
    看啊，百花满地，蝴蝶满园。还不知是蝶多，花多？还不知是花多，蝶多？看啊，四只抖动的蝴蝶在争夺一朵西蕃莲的花蕊。山城的气候特点使山城的花比哪儿的花更香，这儿是我们的一个香水工厂所在地。
    夜晚，站在枇杷山公园的高处往下望，山下是几十万家灯火。你可以用一张黑纸，在上面刺着无数针眼，然后放到灯前看一看，这就是夜重庆，而我是回来了。
