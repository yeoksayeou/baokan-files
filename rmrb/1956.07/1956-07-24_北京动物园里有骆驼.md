    There are Camels in the Beijing Zoo
    In the July 9th edition, page eight, Mr. Shen Congwen said in his article "In Front of Tiananmen Square" that "The Beijing Zoo does not yet have a place for camels. I suggest adding two or three..." No, our Beijing Zoo does have a place for camels. They have been on display in the deer enclosure for more than a year. We hope to correct this. At the same time, we will, according to Mr. Shen Congwen’s suggestion, add information about the role of camels in transportation to the exhibition's description.

    北京动物园里有骆驼
    七月九日八版上沈从文先生在“天安门前”一文中说“北京动物园如今还没有骆驼的位置，我建议不妨加入两三只……”。不，我们北京动物园里有骆驼的位置，在鹿苑里展览一年多了，希望更正。同时，我们将根据沈从文先生的建议，把骆驼在交通运输中所起的作用，加在展览的说明中。
