Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 29th. According to the Romanian News Agency, Romanian newspapers universally published on July 28th a resolution passed by the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party at its recent plenary session regarding the task of completing the socialist transformation of agriculture as stipulated by the Second Congress of the Workers' Party.

The resolution first discussed the achievements made in agricultural collectivization since the Second Party Congress held at the end of last year. The resolution pointed out that from December last year to the end of June this year, the number of collective farms and joint cultivation groups nationwide in Romania had increased from 6,325 to 9,436, the number of households they owned had increased by 51%, and the area of land they owned had increased by 29%. Collective farms and joint cultivation groups now include more than 577,000 peasant households and more than 1.7 million hectares of land. 21% of the total number of laboring peasants are now in cooperative farms of various forms. The socialist sector in Romanian agriculture now accounts for 29.3% of the total cultivated area and 37.1% of the total agricultural area. The resolution stated that these achievements prove that the estimates made by the Party Congress were correct.

The resolution then pointed out that, in order to consolidate and develop collective farms economically and organizationally, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party has put forward to collective farmers a series of proposals for amending and supplementing the model charter of collective farms, in order to greatly improve the labor productivity of collective farmers and agricultural output. The Romanian Workers' Party will continue to pursue a policy of supporting individual laboring peasants and providing them with material incentives so that they may better cultivate their land for their own benefit and the benefit of the country, increase agricultural output and improve their material and cultural standards. Regarding the issue of rich peasants, the plenary session emphasized that the policy of restricting capitalist elements in rural areas will be further implemented. Regarding the issue of rich peasants applying to join cooperatives, the plenary session suggested that they could be absorbed according to different situations.

The resolution also pointed out the need to take appropriate measures to further improve the level of agricultural mechanization, thoroughly improve the work of state farms, and intensify and improve the training of agricultural cadres.

    决议接着指出，为了使集体农庄在经济上和组织上获得巩固和发展，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全体会议已经向集体农民提出了一系列关于集体农庄模范章程的修改和补充的建议，以便大大提高集体农民的劳动生产率和农业产量。罗马尼亚工人党今后还将奉行支持个体劳动农民并且给以物质鼓励的政策，以便他们可能为了他们自己的利益和国家的利益而更好地耕种他们的土地，增加农业产量和提高他们的物质和文化水平。关于富农问题，全体会议着重指出，将进一步执行限制农村中的资本主义成分的政策。对于富农申请参加合作社的问题。全体会议建议可以根据不同情况进行吸收。
