Recalling their past mistakes, they said that in the past, we single-mindedly thought of "for the country" and "for the peace of the Orient," left our beautiful motherland, and invaded China. As a result, we brought pain and sorrow to the Chinese people and our compatriots at home. These former Japanese war criminals stated that after returning to their hometowns, they will be filial to their parents and build happy lives with their brothers, sisters, and wives.

    获释回国的日本战争犯罪分子
    坚决表示不再参加侵略战争
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：被中国释放回国的335名日本战争犯罪分子，在七月三日到达舞鹤后发表声明说，“我们坚决反对再把青春的热情浪费在错误的侵略战争上面。”他们回忆过去的错误说，在过去，我们只一心一意地想着“为了国家”、“为了东洋的和平”，离开美丽的祖国，而去侵略了中国。其结果，我们给中国人民和祖国的同胞们带来了痛苦和悲伤。这些前日本战争犯罪分子表示，他们回到家乡以后，将孝顺父母，同弟兄和妻子建立幸福的生活。
