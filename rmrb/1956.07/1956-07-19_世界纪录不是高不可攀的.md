    World Records Are Not Unreachable
    Dian Yi
    China's twenty-year-old weightlifter Chen Jingkai once said: "World records are not unreachable for athletes of New China." Now this statement has been definitively proven.
    Some say that Chen Jingkai was born with the typical physique of a weightlifter: short, with broad shoulders, short arms, and exceptionally large legs. He can lift 160 kilograms in a "front squat," which is rare even in the world. So they say his ability to break world records is a gift from heaven. This is true, but not entirely. Because breaking world records is, after all, the result of Chen Jingkai's diligent study and hard training.
    In April 1953, Chen Jingkai participated in a weightlifting competition for the first time in his life – the Guangzhou Boxing and Weightlifting Performance – and won second place in the flyweight class. During this competition, the seventeen-year-old Chen Jingkai met a coach from the former South Central Military Region Sports Team. The coach told Chen Jingkai that he had potential in weightlifting and that if he didn't persevere with training, he would be wasting talent for the country. The coach's words left a deep impression on him.
    Soon after, Chen Jingkai graduated from junior high school and returned to his hometown, Shilong Town, Dongguan County, Guangdong. Even in the countryside, he dreamed day and night of becoming a weightlifter. Chen Jingkai's father strongly opposed his son practicing weightlifting, because in the old society this was "the kind of thing that street performers do." Whose advice should he listen to? Chen Jingkai thought that the coach's words made more sense; in the new society, doing anything is serving the people. Chen Jingkai resolutely joined the army in Guangzhou. Later, he was selected for the former South Central Military Region Sports Team.
    After training in the sports team for more than a month, he made rapid progress with the constant encouragement of the leaders of the unit, and soon he was selected for the "August 1st" team to participate in the national weightlifting test in the capital. In this test, many members of the "August 1st" team won first place, but Chen Jingkai was the only one who won seventh place in the flyweight class. What a great stimulus this was for him! Chen Jingkai made an even greater determination to stay in the "August 1st" team and continue to train hard, and his performance improved day by day.
    Last June, Chen Jingkai was selected as a member of the Chinese Youth Weightlifting Team to go to Warsaw to participate in the Second International Youth Games. In this way, his father's attitude also changed. Chen Jingkai received a letter from his father abroad, encouraging him to work hard in training and win glory for the country.
    When Chen Jingkai was in Moscow, he practiced with Soviet weightlifters and received guidance from Soviet weightlifting coaches Pustovoit and Osipov. In just a few days, his total score increased by 42.5 kilograms. After returning to China, the Soviet coaches continued to send letters to guide and encourage him. When Chen Jingkai was studying at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, he continued to train according to the methods guided by the Soviet coaches, and his performance continued to improve. On June 7 this year, in a competition with the Soviet weightlifting team in Shanghai, Chen Jingkai finally lifted a 133-kilogram barbell over his head in the clean and jerk, becoming the first athlete in China to break a world record. After this news spread, Chen Jingkai received a large number of congratulatory letters every day. His father said in a recent letter to Chen Jingkai that breaking the world record this time "is not only the honor of the family and neighborhood, but also the glory of the country."
    Chen Jingkai has already won glory for the country and the people in his position. Now he and his classmates are actively training to prepare for the 16th Olympic Games. (Image attached)

    世界纪录不是高不可攀的
    甸义
    我国二十岁的举重运动员陈镜开曾经说过：“世界纪录对新中国运动员来说，并不是高不可攀的。”现在这句话已经得到了确确实实的证明。
    有人说陈镜开生得一付典型举重家的体型，个子矮，肩宽臂短，两腿异常肥大。他在“前身膝蹲”时能举起一百六十公斤，这在世界上都很少见。所以说他能打破世界纪录是得天独厚。这话不错，可是也不全对。因为能打破世界纪录，毕竟是陈镜开勤学苦练的结果。
    1953年4月，陈镜开生平第一次参加举重比赛——广州市拳击、举重表演会，获得了最轻量级第二名。在这次比赛当中，十七岁的陈镜开结识了前中南军区体工队的一位教练，教练告诉陈镜开，他在举重方面是有前途的，如果不坚持锻炼下去，是给国家浪费了人才。教练的话在他心里留下深刻的印象。
    不久，陈镜开初中毕业，回到家乡广东东莞县石龙镇。就是在乡下，他还日夜幻想做一名举重运动员。陈镜开的父亲极力反对自己儿子练举重，因为在旧社会这是“那些耍把式的人搞的玩艺儿”。听谁的话好呢？陈镜开想还是教练的话有道理，新社会做什么都一样为人民服务。陈镜开坚定不移地到广州参了军。后来被选入了前中南军区的体工队。
    在体工队锻炼一个多月，他得到部队首长的不断鼓励，进步很快，不久又被选入“八一”队来首都参加全国举重测验。这次测验中“八一”队许多队员都得了第一名，唯独陈镜开得的是最轻量级第七名。这对他是多么大的刺激啊！陈镜开下了更大的决心，留在“八一”队继续苦练，成绩一天天进步。
    去年六月，陈镜开被选为中国青年举重队队员去华沙参加第二届国际青年运动会。这样，他父亲的态度也转变了，陈镜开在国外收到父亲的信，信中鼓励他努力锻炼，为国争光。
    陈镜开在莫斯科时，同苏联举重运动员们一起练习，并且得到苏联举重教练员普斯特沃依特和奥西波夫的指导，短短几天他的总成绩就增加了四十二点五公斤。回国以后，苏联教练继续来信指导和鼓励他。陈镜开在北京体育学院学习的时候，仍然按照苏联教练员指引的方法锻炼，成绩不断提高。今年六月七日在上海同苏联举重队比赛的时候，陈镜开终于把133公斤重的杠铃用挺举的姿式举到头上，成为中国第一个打破世界纪录的运动员。这个消息传出后，陈镜开每天都收到大批祝贺信，他的父亲在最近给陈镜开的信中说，这次打破世界纪录“不仅是家庭闾里之荣，乃是国家之光”。
    陈镜开已经在他的岗位上为国家、为人民争得了光荣，现在他正和他的同学们积极锻炼，准备参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会。（附图片）
