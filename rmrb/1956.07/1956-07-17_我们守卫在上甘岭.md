    We Guard Shangganling
    Zhu Tingxun, Meng Hong

    The Korean Armistice Agreement has been in place for three years. For three years, we have been guarding the Shangganling area – this world-renowned heroic position.

    Three years ago, when we left the forward tunnels and withdrew to the northern edge of the demilitarized zone, Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai ordered us to increase our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our defenses, and safeguard the Korean Armistice Agreement. Yes, for three years we have resolutely carried out this order, guarding and patrolling the front lines day and night. In order to monitor all enemy conspiracies, in winter, sentries brave the severe cold of minus thirty degrees, facing the biting north wind, patrolling the snow-covered frozen ground. In summer, sentries squat in grass taller than a person, the sun stings their backs, swarms of annoying mosquitoes bite them, and sometimes poisonous snakes will attack you. When faced with several days of continuous rain, the difficulties are even greater. However, for the sake of the motherland, for the cause of peace, for three years, our soldiers have overcome these difficulties with tenacious perseverance, become accustomed to this kind of life, and learned another set of skills for fighting the enemy. Soldiers are familiar with every tree, every stone, every shell crater on the position, where they are, what they look like, just like the lines on their own palms; they can freely travel along steep and rugged mountain roads at night. Ears trained through practice can accurately distinguish the movements of different wild animals such as wolves, badgers, and wild boars. Alert soldiers can even distinguish those "werewolves" who attempt to cross the border from various sounds and traces, and cleverly capture them. In February of this year, a sentry, Liu Dazhi, quietly tracked a suspicious fellow in a snowy night with the most skilled movements, and finally captured this cross-border special agent in a well-prepared ambush circle. On another occasion, a young soldier, He Jiangen, with the unique care of a sentry, caught an armed special agent covered in straw, preparing to set fire to the warehouse.

    While strictly guarding their positions, the soldiers guarding the front lines have been diligently improving their military, political, and cultural levels for three years. Chen Shunxue, a heavy machine gunner, became a commander capable of directing a heavy machine gun squad for combat and training in less than four months of study in the training battalion, from being an ordinary soldier. The soldier Xiao Weiguang was discharged from the army because of poor health. Before leaving, he left a letter on the rifle he used, saying that this rifle helped him win five merits, and he hoped that the new owner would master it well and carry the struggle to resist America and aid Korea to the end. Later, this rifle was handed over to the young soldier Yang Xingwen. He did not disappoint Xiao Weiguang's expectations. He studied hard day and night, rain or shine. As a result, not only were his shooting scores excellent, but his scores in other subjects were also very good. Later, he gloriously attended the Volunteer Army Youth Activist Congress. A certain company guarding the front lines recently produced a young literacy assault team member. Zhang Jiyou, a member of the Communist Youth League, although not highly educated, served as the "central little teacher" of the company after the cultural instructor was transferred away in April. With the help of leading comrades, he selected several small teachers from each platoon, assigned them to take charge of three classes with different levels of education, and organized everyone to persist in studying every day. As a result, in less than two months, soldiers who originally did not know a single character could recognize three hundred new characters. Officers in the Shangganling area participated in night schools run by the garrison, striving to learn political theory and culture.

    Since the armistice, we have also done our best to assist the Korean people in rebuilding their homes and developing production. In the past three years, we have helped the Korean people living in the Shangganling area to build 9 schools, 389 houses, and 155 other public places, build 18 dams (152,295 meters long), cultivate and sow 6,047,985 pyeong of land, plant more than 200,000 trees, and treat 2,014 people. I remember in the spring of 1954, our office cadres took advantage of a Sunday to go out to a place 10 li away to build a 3,000-meter-long canal for the masses, expanding the irrigation area by 12,000 pyeong, so that the agricultural cooperative obtained a large area of increased production in the autumn. Through mutual assistance and friendly visits, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has been further strengthened. Now, whenever we help the masses transplant rice seedlings or harvest crops in the paddy fields filled with bomb craters, whenever we pass by the schools that have been built and see the children studying happily, our hearts are filled with unspeakable excitement!

    The soldiers far away from the motherland are always concerned about the motherland, and every piece of news about the construction of the motherland encourages us. After the comrades studied the Five-Year Plan, everyone knew that every time we completed a day's combat readiness or training mission, four new construction units could be added to the peaceful land of the motherland. Especially when the news of the socialist upsurge in the motherland came one after another, the cheers on the position were more lively than during festivals. Everyone carried charts and slogans of the 1955 training results, beat gongs and drums, and paraded along the mountainside road for eight or nine li. People's hearts were as warm as spring. In order to support the agricultural cooperation movement in the motherland, we launched a mass movement to donate tractor stations, and the soldiers enthusiastically donated their saved money.

    The loved ones of the motherland often care about our living conditions. In fact, our lives are very good. Now we live in beautiful barracks built by ourselves, with many lush pine trees and colorful wildflowers planted at the door. The vegetables we grow can be eaten in winter. The various fresh vegetables in the famous "Shangganling Vegetable Garden" grow particularly well.

    Dear motherland, every time we see the heroic position in front of us, every time we think of our lovely motherland, we add infinite strength and further strengthen our determination. Just as our soldiers swore at the place where the hero Huang Jiguang sacrificed: "For the motherland, we will always vigilantly hold our weapons tightly and persevere in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea to the end!"

    我们守卫在上甘岭
    祝廷勋　孟虹
    朝鲜停战已经三年了。三年来，我们一直守卫在上甘岭地区——这闻名世界的英雄阵地。
    三年前，当我们走出了前沿坑道，撤回非军事区北缘的时候，金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员就曾命令我们，要百倍提高警惕，加强戒备，保卫朝鲜停战协定。是的，三年来我们坚决地执行了这项命令，日日夜夜守卫和巡逻在前沿。为了监视敌人的一切阴谋活动，冬天哨兵们冒着零下三十度的奇寒，顶着刺骨的北风，巡逻在白雪复盖的冻地上。到了夏天，哨兵们蹲在一人高的草丛里，太阳刺疼了人们的脊背，一群群讨厌的蚊子叮在身上，有时毒蛇也会向你偷袭，遇到几天连绵大雨，困难就更多了。但是，为了祖国，为了和平事业，三年来，我们的战士们用顽强的毅力战胜了这些困难，习惯了这种生活，学会了对敌斗争的又一套本领。战士们对阵地上一棵树、一块石头、一个弹坑，它们在什么地方，是什么样子，都熟悉得像自己的掌纹一样；陡削崎岖的山道，夜晚也可以自由往来。经过锻炼的耳朵，可以准确地辨别出狼、狗獾子、野猪等等不同野兽的走动声。机警的战士们更能从各种不同的声音和行踪里分辨出那些是企图越界的“人狼”，并且巧妙地把他们捕获。今年二月，哨兵刘大志，在一个雪夜，用最熟练的动作悄悄地跟踪着一个值得怀疑的家伙，终于在布好的伏击圈里捕获了这个越界的特务。还有一次，年青的战士何坚根以哨兵特有的细心，捉到了一个周身披着稻草、准备火烧仓库的武装特务。
    守卫在前沿的战士们，在严守阵地的同时，三年来以不倦的努力提高着军事、政治和文化水平。重机枪手陈顺学，在教导营学习不到四个月，便从一个普通的战士变成了能够指挥一个重机枪班进行战斗和训练的指挥员了。战士萧维广因为身体不好复员了，临走以前，他在自己使用的步枪上留下了一封信，说这支枪帮助他立了五次功，希望新的主人要很好地掌握它，把抗美援朝的斗争坚持到底。后来，这支枪交到青年战士杨兴文的手里，他没有辜负萧维广的期望，不分日夜阴晴，天天勤学苦练，结果，不但射击成绩优秀，其它各科成绩都很好，后来光荣地出席了志愿军青年积极分子代表大会。守卫在前沿阵地的某连，最近又出现了一个青年扫盲突击手。青年团员张吉友，文化水平虽然不高，但他从四月间文化教员调走以后，就担任了这个连队的“中心小教员”了。他在领导同志的帮助下，从各排挑选出几名小教员，分工掌握文化程度不同的三个班，每天组织大家坚持学习。结果不到两个月，原来一字不识的战士也能识三百个生字了。在上甘岭地区的军官们，参加了驻军开办的夜校，努力学习政治理论和文化。
    停战以后，我们也尽力协助朝鲜人民重建家园和发展生产。三年来，我们帮助住在上甘岭地区的朝鲜人民修筑学校9所，民房389幢，其它公共场所155幢，修筑堤坝18条（长152，295公尺），耕地和播种6，047，985坪，植树20余万棵，治病2，014人次。记得1954年春天，我们机关干部利用一个星期日，全体出动到10里外的地方给群众修起了一条3，000公尺长的水渠，扩大灌溉面积12，000坪，使那个农业合作社秋后获得了大面积的增产。通过互相帮助和友好访问，中朝人民的友谊进一步密切了。现在，每当我们帮助群众在填平了弹坑的水田里插秧或者收割庄稼的时候，每当我们路过修起的学校，看到孩子们愉快读书的时候，我们的心情真有着说不出的兴奋！
    远离祖国的战士们，时刻都在关心着祖国，祖国建设的每一条新闻都鼓舞着我们。同志们学习了五年计划以后，大家都知道每当我们完成一天战备或训练任务，在祖国和平的土地上就可以增加四个新的建设单位。特别是当祖国社会主义高潮的消息接连传来的时候，阵地上欢庆的声势比过节还热闹。大家扛着1955年训练成绩的图表和标语牌，敲锣打鼓，沿着山腰公路游行八、九里，人们心里像春天一样的暖和。为了支援祖国农业合作化运动，我们开展了群众性的捐献拖拉机站的运动，战士们都热情地捐献了自己节约的余钱。
    祖国的亲人们常常关心我们的生活情况，其实我们的生活是挺好的。现在我们住在亲手建造起来的漂亮的营房里，门口栽上了许多翠绿的松树和鲜艳的野花，我们种的青菜可以吃到冬天，有名的“上甘岭菜园”里的各样鲜菜长得特别好。
    亲爱的祖国，每当我们看到前面的英雄的阵地，每到我们想起可爱的祖国，我们就增添了无穷的力量，更加坚定了我们的决心。正如我们的战士在英雄黄继光牺牲的地方宣誓的时候所说的：“为了祖国，我们永远地警惕地握紧手中武器，坚持抗美援朝斗争到底！”
