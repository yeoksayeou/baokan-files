Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to Kyodo News, former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida issued an open letter to Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu on July 21st, demanding that Shigemitsu take a so-called tough stance in the upcoming resumption of normalization talks between Japan and the Soviet Union, and demanded that the issue of restoring Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations be "transferred from bilateral negotiations to an international conference attracting former Allied countries for discussion."

This former Prime Minister, who stepped down due to faithfully implementing pro-American policies, desperately slandered the Soviet Union's peace policy in his letter. He demanded that Shigemitsu make unreasonable demands of the Soviet Union on issues such as the so-called territorial issues and war criminals during the negotiations.

    日顽固派唯恐日苏关系正常
    吉田叫重光采取死硬态度
    新华社22日讯　据共同社报道，日本前首相吉田茂七月二十一日发表了一封给日本外务相重光葵的公开信，要求重光在即将恢复的日苏关系正常化谈判中采取所谓强硬态度，并且要求把恢复日苏邦交问题“从两国的谈判转移到吸引前盟国参加的国际会议上讨论”。
    这个由于忠实地执行亲美政策而下台的前首相在他的信中拚命地诬蔑苏联的和平政策。他要求重光葵在谈判中就所谓领土问题和战争罪犯等问题对苏联提出无理要求。
