    The Yangtze River Shipping Administration is actively promoting the Soviet advanced producer representatives' "in-line push barge method." Vessels like "Yangtze 305" and "Kuimen" have already applied this advanced experience in long-distance transportation on the Shanghai-Hankou and Hankou-Yichang sections, respectively. With the help of Comrade Belmiakov, a member of the Soviet Advanced Producers Delegation for Maritime and Inland River Transport, the "Yangtze 305" formed an in-line push barge formation and traveled from Shanghai to Hankou, pushing three 1,000-ton barges. The amount of cargo pushed per horsepower increased by approximately 25% compared to the past, and the navigation speed increased by 7%.
    Currently, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration has decided to extract eight to ten tugboats from the Shanghai and Hankou sub-bureaus for the second phase of testing. The bureau's technical and navigation supervision departments are also actively improving vessel mooring equipment and signal lights.

    长江航运管理局推广“一列式顶推法”
    本报讯　长江航运管理局正积极推广苏联先进生产者代表传授的一列式顶推驳船法。“长江305”、“夔门”等轮已分别在沪汉段和汉宜段的长途运输中运用了这项先进经验。“长江305”号轮在苏联海上与内河运输先进生产者代表团团员别尔米亚科夫的帮助下，编成了一列式顶推驳船法的队形，从上海开到汉口，共推了三艘千吨级的大驳船，每马力顶推的货物量约比过去提高25％以上，航行速度提高7％。
    现在，长江航运管理局已决定从上海、汉口分局抽出八到十艘拖轮进行第二阶段的试验。这个局的技术部门和航行监督部门也在积极改进船只系缆设备和信号灯。
