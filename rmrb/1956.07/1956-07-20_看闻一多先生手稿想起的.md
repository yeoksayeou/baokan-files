    Thoughts on Seeing Mr. Wen Yiduo's Manuscripts
    Sun Shikai
    On the morning of the tenth anniversary of Mr. Wen Yiduo's martyrdom, many people at the Beijing Library were busily arranging the "Exhibition of Wen Yiduo's Life, Works, and Manuscripts." Suddenly, a female comrade whispered to the person next to her, "Please wait a moment, what if you accidentally spill water on the manuscript?" The person holding the cup of water immediately and cautiously stepped back a few paces.
    Indeed, the manuscripts of famous scholars and writers are a precious cultural asset of the motherland. Take Mr. Wen Yiduo's surviving manuscripts, for example. The existing manuscripts of Mr. Wen comprise 171 items, totaling 8,841 pages, embodying the author's lifelong efforts.
    At the exhibition, a delicate wooden box also attracted attention, specially made for preserving the manuscripts. After the manuscripts were placed in the wooden box, they were then put into the safe in the library's special manuscript collection vault.
    We should really thank Mr. Wen's family for their generous act, making these manuscripts a cultural asset for all the people. But I am also reminded of another matter. A museum, in preparation for setting up a historical exhibition room, wanted to borrow a valuable manuscript of a predecessor from someone's collection. They went to borrow it repeatedly, but this "collector" not only refused to lend it but even refused to let others see it. This is really too regrettable.

    看闻一多先生手稿想起的
    孙世恺
    在闻一多先生殉难十周年的纪念日那天上午，北京图书馆有许多人正在紧张地布置“闻一多生平、著作及手稿展览”。忽然，有一个女同志向她身旁的人低声说：“请您稍后一点，万一你喝的水点到手稿上一点，可怎么办？”那个拿着杯喝水的人，就立即小心翼翼地退后了几步。
    的确，著名的学者、作家的手稿是祖国的一份珍贵的文化财富。就拿闻一多先生遗留下的手稿来说，现存的闻先生手稿有一百七十一种，八千八百四十一页，凝结着作者毕生的心血。
    在展览会上，引人注意的还有个精致的木匣，这是专为保藏手稿而特制的。手稿装入木匣后，再放进图书馆手稿特藏专库的保险柜中。
    我们实在应该感谢闻先生家属这样慷慨的义举，使这些手稿成为全民的文化财富。但我也想起另外一件事。有个博物馆为筹备布置一个历史陈列室，想借用一下某人保藏的一份富有学术价值的先人手稿文献，曾三番五次去借，可是这位“收藏家”不仅不肯借，甚至不愿意拿出来让别人看看。这就实在太令人遗憾了。
