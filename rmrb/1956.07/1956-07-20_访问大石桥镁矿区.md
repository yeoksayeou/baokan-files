Visiting the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mining Area
Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Xiangbo

Recently, I visited the well-known Dashiqiao Magnesium Mining Area.

Dashiqiao is an important station on the Shenyang-Dalian railway line, located not far southeast of Anshan. From Dashiqiao, taking a winding road through a dim tunnel, a basin surrounded by mountains suddenly appears, which is the center of the magnesium mining area. Many new factories and mines are being built in this area.

To the west of the basin is a very high mountain called Guanma Mountain. Climbing this high mountain and looking around, you can see continuous mountain ranges, huge projects, and apple trees, locust trees, and various flowers and plants covering the mountains and plains.

In this area, on sunny days, many mountain tops radiate snow-white, crystal-clear, and dazzling light. From a distance, they look like snow-capped mountains illuminated by the morning sun. Geologists have identified this phenomenon as a characteristic of high-quality magnesium mines.

Magnesium not only has a jade-like appearance but also has valuable and wide-ranging uses. It can be used to refine metallic magnesium. When this metallic magnesium is alloyed with aluminum, it is lighter and more durable than pure aluminum. Replacing steel and aluminum with it in ships and other means of transportation can significantly reduce weight; if household items are made of metallic magnesium, they will be light, practical, and beautiful; the fireworks set off during various grand ceremonies and the flashbulbs used by photographers all need magnesium to manufacture. Magnesium can also be made into soundproof and heat-insulating cement. Magnesium can be used as an important raw material and material in industries such as medicine, papermaking, rubber, and chemicals.

Magnesium's most important use in modern times is still the manufacture of refractory materials for the metallurgical industry – magnesium bricks, chrome-magnesium bricks, metallurgical magnesia sand, etc. Magnesium refractory materials have the following functions in practical applications:

In a steelmaking furnace, a raging flame, heated to more than 1,600 degrees, melts the ore and scrap steel thrown into it into a churning liquid in no time. If non-mineral substances are thrown in, they will immediately turn to ashes. However, magnesium refractory materials can even withstand higher heat and resist the alkaline substances produced during steelmaking. Therefore, it has become the best refractory material for steelmaking furnaces today and largely determines steel production. At present, most of the steelmaking furnaces in our country are still built with silica bricks for the furnace roof. Since last year, several steelmaking furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel Company have used chrome-magnesium bricks to build the furnace roof, which has more than doubled the life of the furnace roof and greatly shortened the steelmaking time.

Because magnesium is of such great significance to the national economy, as early as four years ago, batches of geological exploration workers came to the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mining Area to carry out detailed work to provide geological data for the large-scale development and utilization of the magnesium mines here.

Last July, thousands of construction workers from Anshan began to build a modern magnesium brick factory here. In addition, a large-scale open-pit magnesium mine is under construction.

The construction work here is progressing rapidly. Last July, when I first visited here, it was full of lush weeds everywhere. But now, the new buildings built for the workers have already welcomed their owners; cooperatives, department stores, post offices... have also been established. Now, the six workshops of the magnesium brick factory, including casting, forging, and carpentry, have been completed, and some have even started production.

According to the leaders of this construction site: At this rate, in the next two years, the magnesium bricks, chrome-magnesium bricks... produced by the magnesium brick factory will be successively transported to various metallurgical enterprises in the motherland.

### 访问大石桥镁矿区

    访问大石桥镁矿区
    新华社记者　张向波
    最近，我访问了中外驰名的大石桥镁矿区。
    大石桥是沈（阳）大（连）铁路线上的一个重要车站，位在鞍山东南不远的地方。从大石桥再乘车，经过蜿蜒曲折的公路，穿越昏暗的隧道，便豁然现出一个群山环绕的盆地，这就是镁矿区的中心。不少新的工厂和矿山正在这一带建设着。
    盆地正西有一个很高的山，名叫观马山。登上这座高山，四外远望，映入眼帘的是连绵的山脉，巨大的工程，还有遮山掩地的苹果树、刺槐、各色各样的花草。
    这一带，在阳光灿烂的日子，许多山头上都放射着雪白晶莹、闪烁刺目的光泽，老远看去，就像是晨光照耀下的雪山。这种景象被地质专家们认定是优良镁矿的特征。
    镁，不只有白玉般的外观，并且有珍贵而广泛的用途。它能炼出金属镁，用这种金属镁同铝制成合金，比单纯的铝还要轻而坚韧。用它代替船舶和其他运输工具上的钢铁和铝，就可以显著减轻重量；家庭日用品如果用金属镁来制造，既轻巧，又美观；举行各种盛典所放的焰火，摄影师所用的镁光灯泡，都要利用镁来制造。镁还能制成隔音、隔热的水泥。镁在医药、造纸、橡胶、化学等工业上，都可以当作重要的原料和材料。
    镁在现代最主要的用途还是制造冶炼工业用的耐火材料——镁砖、铬镁砖、冶金镁砂等。镁制耐火材料在实际应用的时候有这样的功能：
    在炼钢炉里，熊熊的火焰，烧热到一千六百多度，把矿石和碎钢铁投进去，很快就熔化成翻腾奔流的液体。假如把非矿物类的东西投进去，立刻就化为灰烬。但是，镁制的耐火材料甚至能抵挡住更高的热，同时还能抵抗炼钢的时候产生的碱性物质的侵蚀，因而它就成了炼钢炉目前最好的耐火材料，在很大程度上决定着钢产量。现在，我国所有的炼钢炉大部分还是用矽砖砌筑炉顶。去年以来，鞍山钢铁公司有几座炼钢炉用铬镁砖砌筑了炉顶，使炉顶的寿命延长了一倍以上，炼钢的时间也缩短了很多。
    由于镁对于国民经济有着这样的重要意义，因此，早在四年前，一批又一批的地质勘探工作者就来到大石桥镁矿区，进行精细的工作，为大规模开发利用这里的镁矿提供地质资料。
    去年七月，来自鞍山的几千名建设人员开始在这里建设一座近代化的镁砖厂。另外还有一座规模巨大的露天开采的镁矿场在建设。
    这里的建设工作正在迅速的进展着。去年七月，我第一次访问这里的时候，到处满长着茂盛的荒草。而现在，为职工们新盖的楼房已经接待了主人；合作社、百货商店、邮局……也都已经设立起来。现在，镁砖厂所属的铸造、锻工、木工等六个车间，已经建成，有的并且开始生产了。
    据这个工地的领导人说：按照这样的速度，今后两年内，镁砖厂生产的镁砖、铬镁砖……就能陆续的运往祖国的各个冶金企业。
