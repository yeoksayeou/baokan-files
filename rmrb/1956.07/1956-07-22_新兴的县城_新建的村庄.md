    Emerging County Town, Newly Built Villages
    The reclamation base of the Luobei Grassland, located between the Heilongjiang and Songhua Rivers, is gradually showing signs of prosperity. The emerging county town, Fengxiang Town, has already developed into a town of nine thousand people. There is one middle school, two primary schools, a wired broadcasting station, a post and telecommunications bureau, and a hospital (currently being expanded). The department store's outlet has already started operating in a temporary wooden shed, and the company, along with other trade, grain, and food companies, are preparing to build permanent buildings. The number of shops, restaurants, and photo studios has also increased. This new town has developed since the county-level leadership moved here last September.
    On the vast grassland surrounding Fengxiang Town, there are now 25,000 residents with a cultivated area of more than 13,600 hectares. The soybeans, wheat, and various vegetables planted on these lands are growing very well. Among the people who have come here to reclaim the land are 7,000 young reclamation team members and immigrants who arrived after last September, and have established twenty-five new villages. Some of the new villages have built brick kilns and lumberyards in the middle of their temporary thatched sheds, and they are working to build new brick and wood structured houses. Hundreds of new houses have appeared next to the temporary thatched sheds in these new villages.
    The reporter interviewed Shi Changan, the deputy county chief who was born here. His family fled famine from Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, to this place forty years ago. When his family came here, there were only a few villages along the Heilongjiang River. Deputy County Chief Shi spent thirty years on this desolate grassland. Before liberation, there were only 8,000 people and 7,200 hectares of cultivated land here.
    Seventy years ago, this place was uninhabited. At that time, the Qing Dynasty emperors forced farmers to migrate here to mine for them, and that was how people began to settle here.
    There are about 300,000 hectares of land that can be reclaimed here. Once these lands are reclaimed, they can produce 1.5 billion catties of grain annually and can accommodate 300,000 people to live here.

    新兴的县城　新建的村庄
    位在黑龙江和松花江之间的垦荒基地萝北草原已逐渐呈现繁荣景象。新兴的县城——凤翔镇，已是一个发展到九千人的城镇。在这里有中学一所、小学两所、有线广播站、邮电局、新华书店，和正在扩建中的医院各一所。百货公司门市部已在临时木板棚里先行营业，这个公司和其他贸易、粮食、食品等公司正在筹建永久性建筑物。商店、饮食店和照像馆也增多起来。这个新城镇是在去年九月随着县级领导机关迁来以后才发展起来的。
    在凤翔镇周围广阔的草原上，现在共有居民二万五千人，耕地面积达到一万三千六百多公顷，在这些土地上种植的大豆、小麦和各种蔬菜，都生长得很好。到这里来开垦的人当中有去年九月以后到达的七千名青年垦荒队员和移民，建立了二十五个新村。有些新村的临时草棚中间建立了砖瓦窑和木材场，他们正在为筹建砖木结构的新房屋而工作着。已有成百栋的新房舍，相继出现在这些新村的临时草棚旁边。
    记者访问了出生在这里的副县长史长安。他家是在四十年以前从辽宁省宽甸县逃荒到这里来的。他家来这里时，仅仅在黑龙江边有几个村庄。史副县长就是在这寂寞的草原上度过了三十年。到解放前，这里才有八千人口，耕地七千二百公顷。
    七十年前，这里是没有人烟的。当时清朝帝王强迫农民迁移到这里来，为他们开采矿山，才开始有了人家。
    这里能开垦的土地约三十万公顷，这些土地开垦出来能年产十五亿斤粮食，能容纳三十万人在这里生活。
