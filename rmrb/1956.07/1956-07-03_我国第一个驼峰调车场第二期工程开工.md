Construction begins on the second phase of China's first hump classification yard

(Our newspaper reports) Construction on the second phase of China's newly built first automated hump classification yard began on July 1st.

This hump classification yard is located near Fengtai Station, the largest freight hub in the country. Its first phase was completed in December of last year. The second phase of the project is four times larger than the first phase and is expected to be fully completed by the end of 1957. The design and construction arrangements for the project are being carried out under the guidance of Soviet experts.

Upon completion, this hump classification yard will increase the transportation efficiency of the Fengtai hub station, which controls seventeen provinces and one autonomous region in China, by one and a half times.

Currently, the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Municipal Telecommunications Bureau, the Electric Power Bureau, and other units are actively deploying various vehicles and other materials to support the construction of the hump classification yard. Machinery and materials provided by other regions are also being shipped in succession. A large number of laborers from all over Hebei Province have entered the construction site.
