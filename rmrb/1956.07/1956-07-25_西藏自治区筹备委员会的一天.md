    On July 19th, in Lhasa, I visited all the working departments of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, from the scenic Linkas to the magnificent residences. These working departments were established successively before the end of June this year, and more than one hundred Tibetan people from all walks of life in Tibet held the main working positions. The general office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region—the leading organ—located in the Yaoxi Linka below the Potala Palace, was the first institution to be established. Every resolution and instruction of the Preparatory Committee and the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region is issued from here every day. When I visited, the office of the general office had already begun its busy work. The secretariat section, from the section chief to the mailing clerks, is mostly Tibetan. The Zhongyi (secretaries) were translating and sorting out the proposals submitted by relevant units for discussion at the eighth meeting of the Standing Committee. The mimeograph operator Jiangba Jianzhen不停地摇动着油印机的手柄, quickly and nimbly printed hundreds of Tibetan documents. A large number of documents were to be sent to the Dalai Lama for review that day. The Dalai Lama, who is the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, not only considers the overall work, but also often reviews and revises documents word by word. He personally presides over every meeting of the Standing Committee. Although the First Vice Chairman, Panchen Erdeni, is far away in Xigaze, he is equally active in participating in the leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.
    Jiang Jinse, the deputy section chief of the secretariat section, told the reporter: "The Tibetan staff in the section were not familiar with their work at the beginning, and encountered many difficulties. However, the Han staff helped us patiently, and we also worked hard to learn. Now, a sound system has been established in the secretariat section, and everyone has to do their job better." At this time, Danzeng Gyatso, the director of the general office, walked into the office with a thick briefcase, smiling. This senior Tibetan official from the Panchen Kampus Conference Hall Committee in Xigaze, as usual, sat down and seriously began his work.
    Soon, a blue car honked and drove into the courtyard of the general office. Apé Awang Jinmei, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Deputy Secretaries-General Lamin Yixi Chuchen, Bangda Duoji, and Chen Jingbo came here to hold a meeting of the secretaries-general. They represent the central and local governments of Tibet, the Panchen Kampus Conference Hall Committee, and the Changdu area People's Liberation Committee. In the history of Tibet's development, they have never been so closely united in an organ with the nature of a regime, working together without any reservations and cheerfully to build a new life for the Tibetan people.
    At this meeting of the secretaries-general, they reviewed the work summary of the Fourth People's Congress of the Changdu area, and reviewed the work plan of the Animal Husbandry Department of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region for the third quarter of this year. Li Guobi, the director of the Lhasa Leather Factory, and engineer Shi Bingxing, who recently came to Tibet from Beijing, reported to the secretaries-general on the process of the Ministry of Light Industry's preparation for the establishment of the Lhasa Leather Factory and the specific plan for the construction of the factory. The report aroused great interest among the secretaries-general, who nodded frequently to express their approval. When the report mentioned that Luodu Linka in the western suburbs of Lhasa was being considered as the site for the factory, Ape Awang Jinmei asked carefully, and after obtaining the consent of the three deputy secretaries-general, he said: "Factory buildings can be built there." Regarding the urgent problems that need to be solved in the work of preparing for the establishment of the Lhasa Leather Factory, the meeting of the secretaries-general decided that the Industry and Commerce Department would be responsible for leading the handling.
    Coming out of the general office, the reporter then participated in the first plenary meeting of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. This meeting was held in the villa of Jamdong Losang Langjie, the deputy director of the Financial and Economic Committee. When the reporter arrived, Tibetan officials in charge of various financial and economic units, wearing yellow robes and mandarin jackets and draped in red kasayas, were discussing the report made by Xia Zhongyuan, director of the Financial and Economic Committee, on the "Interim Work Tasks of the Financial and Economic Committee and Work Opinions for the Third Quarter of This Year." They were all taking notes in their notebooks and carefully reading and excerpting Tibetan documents, exchanging opinions with each other. Cailong Dasang Zhandu, director of the Construction Department, Bangda Yangpi, director of the Industry and Commerce Department, and Losang Chenglie, director of the Agriculture and Forestry Department, all put forward many supplementary opinions.
    In the Health Department, the reporter saw Director Ranba Angji Wangdui working with Liang Hong, the Han deputy director, to study the plan for political and professional learning for the Tibetan and Han staff in the department. In the Cultural and Educational Department, the staff initially formulated the plan for establishing primary schools throughout Tibet and the plan for the construction of Lhasa Middle School.
    In the newly established departments of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the reporter saw: This is how people work together happily every day for the construction of Tibet.

    西藏自治区筹备委员会的一天
    新华社记者　宗子度
    七月十九日，记者在拉萨从风景优美的林卡到建筑辉煌的宅第，一一访问了西藏自治区筹备委员会所属的各个工作部门。这些工作部门都是在今年六月底以前先后建立起来的，由一百多名来自西藏各地各阶层的藏族人士担任着主要的工作职务。布达拉宫下面尧西林卡里的西藏自治区筹备委员会的首脑机关——办公厅，是最先建立的一个机构。每天从这里，发出西藏自治区筹备委员会和常务委员会的一切决议和指示。当记者前去访问时，办公厅的办公室里已经开始了繁忙的工作。秘书科，从科长到收发员绝大部分都是藏族。仲衣（秘书）们正在翻译和整理有关单位提交第八次常务委员会讨论的议案。油印员降巴兼真不停地摇动着油印机的手柄，迅速而敏捷地把好几百份藏文文件印刷出来。大批的文件要在当天送给达赖喇嘛审阅。担任西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员的达赖喇嘛，除了考虑全面的工作以外，还常常逐字逐句的审阅和修改文件。每次常务委员会开会时，他都亲临主持。第一副主任委员班禅额尔德尼虽然远在日喀则，但也是同样积极主动地参与了西藏自治区筹备委员会的领导工作。
    秘书科副科长江金色告诉记者说：“科里的藏族工作人员开始都不熟悉自己的业务，碰到了不少困难。但是，汉族工作人员耐心的帮助我们，我们也努力的学习。现在，秘书科里已建立了健全的制度，谁都要把自己的工作作得更好。”这时，办公厅主任丹增嘉措提着厚厚的公文皮包微笑着走进了办公室。这位来自日喀则班禅堪布会议厅委员会的高级藏族官员，像往常一样，一坐下来就认真的开始了工作。
    不久，一辆蓝色的小汽车鸣叫着驶进了办公厅的庭院。西藏自治区筹备委员会秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美和副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣、邦达多吉、陈竟波来到这里举行秘书长会议。他们分别代表着中央和西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会的几个方面。在西藏发展的历史上，他们还从来没有这样亲密地团结在一个带政权性质的机关里，互相无顾虑地、欢洽地为西藏人民建设新的生活工作着。
    在这次秘书长会议上，他们审阅了昌都地区第四届人民代表会议工作总结，审阅了西藏自治区筹备委员会畜牧处今年第三季度的工作计划。新近从北京来到西藏的拉萨皮革厂厂长李国壁和工程师石炳星，向秘书长们汇报了轻工业部筹建拉萨皮革厂的经过和建厂的具体计划。汇报引起了秘书长们极大的兴趣，他们频频点头表示赞许。当汇报到准备选择拉萨市西郊的洛堆林卡为厂址时，阿沛·阿旺晋美作了仔细地询问，并征得三位副秘书长的同意，然后说：“可以在那里兴建厂房。”关于筹建拉萨皮革厂工作中急需解决的问题，秘书长会议决定由工商处负责领导办理。
    从办公厅里出来，记者接着参加西藏自治区筹备委员会财政经济委员会第一次全体委员会议。这个会议是在财政经济委员会副主任詹东·洛桑郎杰的别墅里举行的。记者赶到的时候，穿着黄袍马褂、披着红色袈裟的各财经主管单位的藏族负责官员们，正在讨论财政经济委员会主任夏仲远所作的“关于财经委员会的暂行工作任务及本年第三季度工作意见”的报告。他们都在笔记本上记录，并仔细的阅读和摘录着藏文文件，互相交换着意见。建设处处长擦绒·达桑占度、工商处处长邦达养丕和农林处处长洛桑称烈等，都提出了许多补充的意见。
    在卫生处，记者看见处长然巴·昂吉旺堆正在和汉族副处长梁洪一起研究处内藏、汉族工作人员政治和业务学习的计划。在文教处，工作人员们初步制定了西藏全区建立小学的规划和拉萨中学的建校计划。
    在新建立的西藏自治区筹备委员会各个部门里，记者看到了：人们就是这样每天为建设西藏而团结愉快的工作着。
