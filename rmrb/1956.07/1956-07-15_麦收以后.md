      This is called Unpredictable
    One evening, Xiao Shicheng, a middle peasant member of the Huoyan Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei, returned home with his sickle. Before he even hung his sickle on the window frame, he asked his wife, "Little Guozi's mother, how much wheat did we get distributed today?" His wife took out the voucher and handed it to him, "The team leader said it's five hundred catties, see if it's written correctly." Xiao Shicheng took it to the light to look at it, then went to the inner room to grab a handful of wheat to examine it carefully. His wife said impatiently, "Don't worry so much! The wheat is plump and clean. The food is getting cold, eat quickly." Xiao Shicheng put the wheat back where it was, and as soon as he picked up his bowl, he said without preamble: "Things are really unpredictable!" His wife asked, "What can't you figure out again?" He said, "When we switched to the advanced cooperative, the cadres talked about increasing production at the meeting, but I really let it go in one ear and out the other. Although I didn't say anything, I really didn't believe it in my heart. After switching to the advanced cooperative, the plan was for each mu of wheat to produce three hundred and fifty catties this year; judging by the current situation, it is hopeful that each mu will produce four hundred catties. This is called unpredictable!" His wife continued, "Hey! At that time, I thought this way: the land hasn't been changed, the labor force hasn't increased, and the advantage is only for those households with more labor and less land. As for us, we can't get dividends from the land anymore, and at the very least, we'll have to reduce our income by half. Who knew that not only did it not decrease, but we even got six hundred and fifty catties more than last year." As soon as his wife finished speaking, Xiao Shicheng asked his son, "Little Stink, do you think you'll pass the high elementary school exam?" Before Little Stink could speak, his second daughter, Chun Guo, said, "Look! The old folks are so biased, the little boy hasn't even graduated from elementary school and they're already thinking about him taking the high elementary school exam. I'm about to graduate from high elementary school during the summer vacation, and a few days ago you said you wouldn't let me take the middle school exam!" Xiao Shicheng said, "Hey, the cooperative has increased production, let alone middle school, I'll let you go to high school too."
      The Knot is Untied
    Qian Xiquan, a member of the Xinfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shengqiao Township, Baoshan County, Jiangsu, has a family of ten people, seven of whom are full or semi-able-bodied laborers. When the cooperative was first established, he had many ideological concerns, fearing that his income would decrease after joining the cooperative. Even after joining the cooperative, he was still full of worries.
    After this small-scale pre-distribution, the whole family received a total of one thousand six hundred and fifty-eight catties of wheat, one hundred and nineteen yuan and eight jiao in cash, and more than five thousand catties of firewood. Last year, when he worked alone, he planted seven mu of wheat and only harvested seven hundred and fifty catties. Not to mention anything else, the wheat alone earned nine hundred and eight catties more this year than last year. The knot in Qian Xiquan's heart was suddenly untied.
      A Letter of Good News
    Yang Lieyun, a cadre at the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Cadre School, is from Fulou Township, Teng County. He is studying away from home, and the people in his family are either old or young. In addition, they have no livestock, and their lives are very difficult. He often felt uneasy whenever he received a letter from home. After joining the agricultural cooperative, he was still worried that households like his with no labor force would not necessarily see their lives improve immediately.
    In early June, he received another letter from his mother. This time, it brought him not unease, but indescribable joy. The letter said: The cooperative is doing a great job in production, and the entire cooperative's more than one thousand mu of wheat has had a bumper harvest. During the pre-distribution, our family received a net distribution of one thousand seven hundred and ten catties of wheat, more than seven hundred catties more than last year. This is the first time our family has harvested so much wheat.
    The letter also said: Although our family has no labor force, the cooperative takes special care of us, and always tries to find some suitable work for us to do. My aunt, my sister and I are not only working hard, but also attending spare-time school. We also bring books when we go to work in the fields...
    This letter relieved Yang Lieyun of his worries about family matters. He will concentrate all his energy on his studies, preparing to better serve agriculture in the future.
    The Old Couple are Overjoyed
    In the Taiyanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Laixi County, Shandong, there is a seventy-year-old man named Li Wuliang. Before joining the cooperative, because he himself had a stomach ailment and his wife had consumption, the old couple couldn't even carry a load of water, let alone work. In the past few years, their son-in-law helped them farm; but later, the son-in-law couldn't manage either. With no other choice, they had to go to their nephew. But his nephew said, "I don't care about your two or three mu of land, you should think of something else!" The old couple said sadly, "People like us would be better off dead!"
    Last year, when the elementary cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, they were absorbed into the cooperative. At that time, although the cooperative's cadres told him that they would implement the "Five Guarantees," he was still skeptical. He thought, "Even my nephew doesn't care, how can the cooperative support me for free?" After the cooperative was established, not only did it subsidize the old couple with work points according to the "Five Guarantees" policy, but it also found light work for them in all aspects. The old couple's concerns were eliminated, and they worked harder. From last winter to the wheat harvest, they have already done one hundred and thirty-six work points, and they will be able to do two hundred and seventy more work points by autumn. Together with the four hundred work points subsidized by the cooperative, the total grain distributed for the year will be more than double what it was before joining the cooperative. Just the pre-distribution of wheat during the wheat season will be three hundred catties of grain. The old couple are overjoyed!

    麦收以后
      这就叫估不透
    一天傍晚，河北邢台县火焰农业社的中农社员肖士成，提着镰刀回到家中。他手里的镰刀还没挂到窗棂上，就问老伴：“小果子妈，今天给咱分了多少小麦？”他老伴掏出领取实物证交给他：“队长说是五百斤，你看写的对不对。”肖士成拿到灯下看了看，又到里间抓出一把麦子来仔细观看。老伴不耐烦地说：“别多操心啦！麦子又饱又净。饭凉了，快吃饭吧。”肖士成把麦子送回原处，刚端起碗来就没头没尾地说：事情真叫人难估！他老伴问：“你又估不清啥啦？”他说：“转高级社的时候，干部在会上讲增产，我真是东耳进西耳出，虽没有说什么，心里真有些不信。转高级社以后，计划今年每亩小麦产三百五十斤；按现在看，每亩产四百斤也有希望。这就叫估不透！”老伴接着说：“咦！那时候我这样想：地没有换土，劳力也没有增多，优越也不过是那些劳力多、土地少的户，咱么，地不能分红了，顶少也得减一半收入。谁知道不但没有减少，还比去年多分六百五十斤哩。”老伴的话刚落音，肖士成就问儿子：“小臭，考高小沾不沾？”小臭还没开口，二闺女春果就说：“看吧！当老人的多偏心，小子初小还没毕业就惦记他考高小，俺到暑假高小就要毕业了，前些天还说不让俺去考中学！”肖士成说：“嘿，社里增了产，别说初中，高中我也让你上。”
      疙瘩解开了
    江苏宝山县盛桥乡新丰农业生产合作社社员钱锡全，家有十口人，其中整半劳力有七个。在初办社的时候，他思想顾虑很多，老怕入社以后减少收入。就是在入社以后，也还是顾虑重重。
    经过这次小熟预分，全家共分麦子一千六百五十八斤，现金一百一十九元八角，还分到五千多斤柴草。而去年单干的时候，种了七亩麦子，只收到七百五十斤。不说别的，光麦子一项，今年就比去年多收入九百零八斤。钱锡全心里的疙瘩一下子就解开了。
      一封报喜信
    山东省农业干部学校的杨列云，是滕县付楼乡人。他在外学习，家中的人老的老，小的小，再加上没有牲口，生活过得很困难。他常常一接到家信，就心神不安。加入农业合作社以后，他仍然顾虑着像他家那样的无劳力户，生活也不一定会马上好起来。
    六月初，他又收到了母亲的来信。这次带给他的不是使他不安，而是说不出的高兴。信上说：社里生产搞得很好，全社一千多亩小麦丰收了。在预分的时候，咱家净分小麦一千七百一十斤，比去年多收七百多斤。收这样多的小麦，在咱家还是第一次。
    信上还说：咱家虽然没有劳动力，但社里照顾的特别好，总是尽量给找一些适当的活干。我和你婶母、妹妹，不光好好干活，还上了业余学校。在下地干活的时候，也带着书。……
    这一封信，使杨列云不再为家事而烦恼了。他要把全部精力集中在学习上，准备将来更好地为农业服务。
    老俩口乐坏啦
    山东莱西县太阳红农业生产合作社，有一个七十岁的老头，名叫李务良。在入社以前，因为他自己有胃病，老伴有痨病，老俩口不用说干活，就连一担水也挑不动。前几年，有女婿帮着种地；但以后女婿也顾不过来了。没办法，只好去找侄子。谁知他的侄子却说：“你那二、三亩地，我没看在眼里，还是打别的主意吧！”老俩口伤心地说：“像咱这样的人，不如早死的好！”
    去年，初级社转高级社的时候，他们被吸收入社了。当时，社的干部虽然告诉他要实行“五保”，但他还是半信半疑。他想：“连侄子都不管，合作社还能白养吗？”社办起后，不光按“五保”政策给老俩口补助了工分，还从各方面找轻活给他们干。老俩口的顾虑消除了，干活也起劲了。从去冬到麦收，已做了一百三十六分工，到秋后还能做二百七十分工，加上社里补助的四百分工，全年分的粮食比入社前要增加一倍还多。只是麦季预分，就能分到三百斤粮食。老俩口可乐坏啦！
