Shanghai Has Such a Market
	Shi Rongzhang

	The Urumqi Middle Road Market in Shanghai is one of the larger of the fourteen markets in Shanghai's Xuhui District. There are 446 vendors doing business here, and more than 150 family members helping them. This market sells more than 440 kinds of non-staple foods every day, including aquatic products, food, vegetables, and bean products.
	Walking into this market, customers are first attracted by the eye-catching introductions to various non-staple food cooking methods. The introductions detail the cooking methods for various vegetables. For egg dishes alone, there are thirty-eight cooking methods, such as scrambled eggs with tomatoes, scrambled eggs with onions, and poached eggs. In the past, housewives generally only knew a few simple cooking methods. Now, they can change things up frequently based on the introductions on the cooking method sheets, so that everyone in the family eats to their satisfaction.
	Under a three-zhang-long canvas awning, there is a long counter made of wooden boards, covered with a clean white tablecloth. This is the "Prepared Dish Supply Point," next to which hangs a menu and price list for prepared dishes. The Prepared Dish Supply Point provides customers with more than sixty kinds of prepared dishes every day. Most of these prepared dishes are brightly colored, flavorful, and relatively nutritious, and each dish costs as little as five cents, and no more than thirty-five cents. Customers are very interested in prepared dishes. In the past, housewives were most annoyed when going to the market because they couldn't think of new varieties, and washing and cutting vegetables was also troublesome. Now, they can just choose a few prepared dishes, and they are ready to cook after returning home. The "Prepared Dish Supply Point" sells more than 1,000 prepared dishes every day.
	To the north of the Prepared Dish Supply Point, there is a glass counter, from which a burst of fragrance emanates. This is the retail point for roast duck. When the roasted,焦黄油亮(brown, yellow, and glistening with oil) ducks are delivered to the retail point, the customers standing outside the glass counter quickly buy up all the ducks. In addition to retail business, they can also process whole ducks for customers. If you give them a cleaned duck for processing, you only need to pay a dime for seasoning, and soon, a steaming, fragrant roast duck can be taken home.
	One Sunday morning, an old lady wanted to make shrimp and egg stew for her son. She only needed a few shrimp, but she didn't know if they would sell her such a small amount. She told the vendor why she was buying shrimp, and the vendor said: "Buying five cents worth is enough." The old lady bought the shrimp for only five cents. Such things can be seen everywhere in the market. The vendors treat customers buying a green vegetable or a radish with the same patience and enthusiasm. If customers find it troublesome to cut meat slices, chop meat paste, pick vegetables, or scrape fish scales, there are dozens of "voluntary processing service stations" here, specializing in serving customers. If the amount of processing is large and you don't have time to wait, you can leave your address, and the market will immediately send someone to deliver it after processing.
	In the open space of the market, basins of clear water are placed everywhere, with towels and soap hanging by the basins. These are specially for customers who buy greasy non-staple foods such as meat, fish, and shrimp to wash their hands. It is very tiring to go to the market to buy groceries, especially for some housewives. They often like to circle around the market a few times to see what seasonal vegetables are available in the market today, and to compare which stall's vegetables are fresher. ... Now, when customers feel tired, they can go to the market's "customer rest area" to rest for a while.
	In the past, many Shanghai people brought scales with them when they went to the market to buy groceries, to avoid being deceived by vegetable vendors. Now, although there is a "public scale verification point" in this market, only a few people go there to verify every day. Customers have confidence in the business style of this market.
	On June 10th, Shanghai experienced a high tide. That morning, the streets and alleys in the city with lower terrain were flooded. However, in the Urumqi Middle Road Market, each stall still had as many non-staple foods as usual. The vendors stood in the muddy yellow water, still warmly receiving customers who waded through the water. They also considered that some customers might not be able to come to buy groceries due to the flood, and immediately organized thirteen people, carrying eighteen kinds of non-staple foods, wading through the water to deliver them to the deeply flooded areas of Shanghai New Village and Fuxing West Road. In this mobile supply, they not only received a lot of praise from customers, but also discovered new clues to improve service quality. Some households only have a gray-haired old lady and a few grandchildren who have just learned to walk at home. In some families, both husband and wife go out to work early in the morning, leaving only one or several children at home. It is very difficult for the heads of these families to go to the market to buy groceries every day. After discovering this situation, the vendors printed many "Customer Purchase Order Forms" and distributed them to the housewives of these families, asking them to fill in the form with the vegetables they need to buy the next day. The next day, according to the names and quantities of the dishes on the form, they send someone to deliver them to the customer's home.

    上海有这样一个菜场
    施荣章
    上海市乌鲁木齐中路菜场，是上海徐汇区十四个菜场中比较大的一个。在这里作生意的有四百四十六个摊贩，还有一百五十多个家属帮助他们。这个菜场每天经营的水产、食品、蔬菜、豆制品等副食品共有四百四十种以上。
    走进这个菜场，顾客们首先被各种醒目的副食品烹饪法介绍单吸引住了。在介绍单上，详细地写着各种蔬菜的烹调法，其中仅蛋品一项，就有西红柿炒蛋、洋葱炒蛋、水泡蛋等三十八种烧制法。过去主妇们一般只知道几种简单的烹饪法。现在可以根据烹饪法单上的介绍，经常变换花样，让家里人个个吃得满意。
    在一顶三丈多长的帆布篷帐底下，设置着一只用木板架起来的长柜，柜上铺着洁白的台布，这里是“盆菜供应处”，旁边挂着盆菜的菜单和价目。盆菜供应处每天为顾客配备了六十多种盆菜。这些盆菜，大都是色艳味鲜，营养比较好，而且每盆价格少的只有五分钱，多的也不过三角五分。顾客们对盆菜很感兴趣。过去上菜场买菜，主妇们最感烦恼的是想不出新花色，洗菜、切菜又麻烦，现在只要选购几只盆菜，回家后就能下锅了。“盆菜供应处”每天要卖掉一千多盆盆菜。
    在盆菜供应处的北边，设着一个玻璃柜台，从这里散发出来一阵阵香味。这就是挂炉烧鸭零售处。当一只只烧好了的焦黄油亮的烧鸭，送到零售处的时候，站在玻璃台外面的顾客们很快就把烧鸭分买光了。这里，除了零售业务外，还可以代顾客整只加工。如果把光鸭交给他们加工，只要付一角钱的作料费，不多久，一只热气腾腾的、香味扑鼻的烧鸭就可以带回家去了。
    一个星期天的早晨，一位老太太想给儿子做一只虾仁炖蛋。她只要很少几只虾仁就够了，可是不知道肯不肯卖。她将自己买虾仁的用途告诉了摊贩，摊贩就说：只要买五分钱就够了。老太太只花了五分钱就买到了虾仁。像这样的事情，在菜场里到处都能见到，摊贩们对顾客买一棵青菜、一个萝卜，都同样耐心热情地接待。顾客们如果嫌切肉片、剁肉浆、拣菜蔬、刮鱼鳞麻烦，这里设有数十处“义务加工服务站”，专门为顾客服务。如果加工的数量较多，自己又没有时间等，那么你只要留下地址，等加工完后，菜场就会立即派人送去。
    在菜场的空地上，到处都摆着一盆盆的清水，盆边挂着毛巾和肥皂。这是专门给购买肉类、鱼虾等油腥副食品的顾客们洗手的。到菜场里买菜是很累的，特别是一些家庭主妇们，她们往往喜欢在菜场里多兜几个圈子，看看今天菜场里有哪些时令的菜蔬，比较
  哪一摊的菜蔬更新鲜。……现在，当顾客们感到疲乏的时候，就可以到这个菜场的“顾客休息处”去休息一会。
    过去，很多上海人到菜场买菜，都要随身带秤，免得受菜贩欺骗。现在，这个菜场里虽然有一个“公秤校验处”，但是每天只有很少的人到那里去校验。顾客们对这个菜场里的经营作风已经有了信任。
    六月十日，上海来了大潮汛。那天早晨，市内地势较低的街道和里弄都淹进了水。但是在乌鲁木齐中路菜场里，每个摊位上仍然摆着和往常一样多的副食品。菜贩们站在浑黄色的水里，仍在热情地接待着涉水而来的顾客。他们还考虑到可能有一部分顾客因为水淹不能来买菜，又立即组织了十三个人，带着十八种副食品，涉水分送到上海新村、复兴西路一带被水淹较深的地区去。在这次流动供应中，他们一方面得到了不少顾客的表扬，同时也发现了新的提高服务质量的线索。有些住户，平时家里只留着一个头发花白的老太太和几个刚刚学会开步的孙儿女；有的家里夫妇两人一清早就出去办公了，家里只留着一个或几个小孩子。这些家庭的主人，每天上菜场买菜是很困难的。摊贩们发现这个情况后，就印了许多“顾客购货预定单”，分发给这些家庭的主妇，请她们在单上填好第二天需要购买哪些菜蔬。到第二天，他们根据单上的菜名、数量，派专人送到顾客家里去。
