    We Need Support
    We are the exploration staff of the 602 Team of the Chongqing Geological Exploration Company, and we moved to the Xiangqian area at the beginning of this year to conduct exploration work. This area is located on the edge of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with a sparse population and many difficulties in life. We often cannot buy flour for one or two months and cannot eat steamed buns. We eat together with the migrant workers, and the consumption of grain greatly exceeds the quota. The local grain department does not help us solve this difficulty. The supply of non-staple food is also very poor, and it is difficult to buy pork. When employees get sick, the local medical institutions are not actively helping to treat them. We hope that the local Party and government will give us more support.

    我们需要支援
    我们是重庆地质勘探公司六○二队的勘探工作人员，今年初迁来湘黔区进行勘探工作。这里处于云贵高原的边沿地带，人烟较少，生活有不少困难，常常一两个月买不到面粉，吃不上馒头。我们和民工一起开伙，粮食的消耗大大超过定量，当地粮食部门也不帮助我们解决这个困难。副食品的供应也很差，猪肉很难买到。职工生了病，当地医疗机关也不积极帮助治疗。希望当地党和政府更多的支持我们。
