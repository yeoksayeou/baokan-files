Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 22nd: Anhui Province is carrying out comprehensive planning for the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects in every township, to ensure more planned water conservancy construction after the autumn harvest. More than half of the province's three thousand seven hundred townships have now completed their comprehensive planning, and the remaining townships will be able to complete it by the end of August.

After achieving collectivization, Anhui Province's farmers, in order to eliminate common drought and flood disasters within seven years, launched an unprecedented large-scale movement to build small-scale water conservancy projects last winter and this spring. The amount of earthwork done was equal to the total of the past six years. However, because various regions lacked accurate understanding of local historical rainfall, crop water requirements, and the drainage and irrigation capacity of existing water conservancy projects, there was no overall plan. As a result, in some areas, projects that should have been delayed were built early, those that should have been built on a smaller scale were built on a larger scale, and some that should not have been built were also built, resulting in waste.

In order to solve the problems existing in the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, since December last year, counties in Anhui Province have successively established full-time water conservancy work teams. These work teams have gone deep into the townships, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and mastering the characteristics of small projects, large benefits, quick results, and easy handling by the masses, to conduct comprehensive planning and formulate plans for implementation over several years. This has corrected the tendency of blind construction and excessive demands in many regions.

### 保证秋后有计划地兴修水利  安徽各乡进行水利工程全面规划

    保证秋后有计划地兴修水利
    安徽各乡进行水利工程全面规划
    新华社合肥22日电　安徽省正在逐乡进行兴修小型水利工程的全面规划，以保证秋后更有计划地兴修水利。现在全省三千七百多个乡中已有一半完成了全面规划，其余的乡到八月底也都可以完成。
    实现了合作化后的安徽省农民，为在七年内消灭一般旱、涝灾害，去冬今春就掀起了空前规模的兴修小型水利的运动。所做土方等于过去六年的总和。但是，由于各地对当地历年降雨量、作物需水量和原有水利工程的排涝、灌溉能力都缺乏确实的了解，没有通盘的计划。因此有些地区的工程就形成应迟修的早修了、应少修的多修了，还有些不应修的也修了，造成浪费。
    为了解决兴修小型水利工程中存在的问题，从去年十二月起，安徽省各县先后成立了专职的水利工作队。这些工作队都深入各乡，本着因地制宜的方针和掌握工程小、收益大、收效快和群众易办的原则，进行全面规划，并且拟订出分年实施的计划。这样，就纠正了许多地区盲目兴修和要求过急的偏向。
