    A False Alarm
    Chen Yichao
    One night in June, the sky was gloomy, and a torrential rain poured down like a waterfall.
    The sound of the rain startled Ma Guangsheng, a cart worker who was snoring in his sleep. He suddenly sat up and reached for the matches and candle by the head of the bed. He looked around the room, and still not reassured, he got up and peered out the window. He did all this skillfully and quickly. However, this time, Ma Guangsheng was at a loss: the tall house, the walls around him gleaming white. A cart was parked under the eaves outside the window. Although it was pouring rain outside, it was quiet inside. His wife and daughter were sleeping soundly.
    He paused to think, and then smiled.
    "Ah! It turns out I was dreaming. We've already moved to Happiness Village. What's there to be afraid of even if it rains heavily!" So he fell back into a peaceful sleep.
    Ma Guangsheng had just moved into Happiness Village from Anhuasi that day. He used to live in a small, dilapidated mud house in Anhuasi, with walls that were collapsing. If the children accidentally pushed it too hard while playing, the dirt on the walls would fall down in a rush. The roof beams were already rotten, and the roof was sloping downwards. It was even worse when it was windy and rainy, with pots and jars placed everywhere on the bed and on the floor to catch the rain, leaving no place for people to stay. Even on ordinary days, he had to prepare matches and candles when he went to bed at night, and as soon as he heard the sound of rain, he had to get up immediately to light the candles and check if the house was in danger of collapsing. This habit that had been formed over the years caused Ma Guangsheng to have a false alarm on his first night in Happiness Village.
    There are still quite a few dilapidated and dangerous houses like the one Ma Guangsheng used to live in in Beijing. In order to ensure the safety of the lives and property of these residents, the Beijing Real Estate Management Bureau has allocated 320 public houses for them to live in this year. The thirty-odd households that moved into Happiness Village this time are only a part of them. In addition, the Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau has also decided to build 1,500 houses (30,000 square meters) in three locations outside Yongdingmen, Guangqumen, and Jiuwangfen outside Chaoyangmen for residents to live in.

    一场虚惊
    陈一超
    六月的一个夜晚，天阴沉沉地，一阵急雨像瀑布一样倾泻下来。
    哗啦啦的雨声，惊动了正在鼾睡的板车工人马广生。他忽地翻身坐起，就伸手到炕头边去摸火柴和蜡烛。他向房内东瞧西看，还不放心，又爬起向窗外张望。这一切，他做得既熟练又快。可是，这次，马广生却茫然了：高大的房屋，四周的墙壁泛着白光。窗外的廊沿下停放着板车。外面虽然下着倾盆大雨，而房内却很安静。妻子和女儿睡得那样香甜。
    他定神一想，笑起来了。
    “啊！原来是我在发梦哩，已搬来幸福村了，下大雨还怕什么呢！”于是他又安安稳稳地入了睡乡。
    马广生是那天白天才从安化寺搬进幸福村的，原来在安化寺住的一间小破土屋，墙壁东倒西歪。孩子们在玩耍时如果不小心用力推一下，墙上的土就哗哗地往下落。房梁都已腐朽，房顶向下倾斜。遇着刮风下雨天更是糟糕，坑上、地上到处都摆满了接雨的盆盆罐罐，人都没处呆。就是在平日，晚上睡觉时，也要准备好火柴和蜡烛，一听见雨声，就得马上起来点上蜡烛查看房屋有没有倒塌的危险。这多年养成的习惯，使马广生搬到幸福村头一夜晚白受了一场虚惊。
    像马广生过去住的那样破烂的危险房屋，在北京市还有不少，为了保证这部分居民的生命财产的安全，北京市房产管理局今年拨了三百二十间公家房屋给他们住，这次搬进幸福村的三十多户居民只是其中的一部分。另外市房产管理局还决定在永定门外、广渠门外和朝阳门外九王坟等三处修建一千五百间（三万平方公尺）房屋，供给居民居住。
