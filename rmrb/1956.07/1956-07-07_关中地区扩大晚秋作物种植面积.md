    (Our report) The Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province is rushing to harvest wheat, and is now working intensely to plant late autumn crops to compensate for the summer losses in the autumn. According to statistics from Lintong County, the acreage of various late autumn crops throughout the county has increased by more than 200,000 mu compared to the original plan. The Gaowangchuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhenyuan Township, Wugong County, only planted more than 500 mu of autumn fields last year. This year, it originally planned to plant 3,200 mu, but has now planted 4,000 mu.
    Expanding the multiple cropping area and increasing land utilization in the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province are entirely feasible. These areas have four months between the summer harvest and autumn wheat sowing, which is enough time for general late autumn crops to grow. In the past, farmers in the Guanzhong region rarely planted late autumn crops because of insufficient labor, livestock, and capital, and because they were worried that planting late autumn crops after the wheat harvest would affect the next season's wheat harvest. After agricultural cooperation, there were conditions for expanding the planting of late autumn crops, and some cooperatives planted them. Facts have proven that the following crop of wheat still yielded a bumper harvest. According to estimates, the more than 1,900 mu of wheat grown as a follow-up crop by the Mingxing First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengxi Township, Xianyang County, will have an average yield of over 550 jin per mu. The Guanzhong region has more than 16 million mu of wheat fields. If late autumn crops can be planted every year after the wheat harvest, grain production will increase significantly.

### 关中地区扩大晚秋作物种植面积

    关中地区扩大晚秋作物种植面积
    本报讯　陕西省关中地区抢收了小麦以后，目前正在紧张地抢种晚秋作物，要在秋季弥补夏季的损失。据临潼县统计，全县各种晚秋作物面积比原计划增加了二十多万亩。武功县贞元乡高望川农业生产合作社，去年只种了五百多亩秋田，今年计划原种三千二百亩，现已种了四千亩。
    扩大复种面积，提高土地利用率，在陕西省关中地区是完全有条件的。这些地区从夏收到秋播小麦，中间有四个月的时间，足够一般晚秋作物生长。过去，关中地区的农民，因为劳力、畜力和资金不足，又担心麦收后种晚秋作物会影响下季小麦收成，所以，很少种晚秋作物。农业合作化后，有了扩种晚秋条件，有些社就种了晚秋作物，事实证明回茬小麦一样得到丰收。咸阳县沣西乡明星第一农业生产合作社的一千九百多亩回茬麦子，据测算每亩平均产量要超过五百五十斤。关中地区有一千六百多万亩麦田，如果每年能在收小麦后种上晚秋作物，粮食产量将显著增加。
