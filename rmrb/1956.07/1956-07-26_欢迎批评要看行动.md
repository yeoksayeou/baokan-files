Welcome Criticism, Look at Actions
娄连玲

When the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Weekly was founded in January 1954, the CCP Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company Committee published instructions on how to run the newspaper well. In addition to asking the newspaper to praise good people and good deeds, the instructions also required it to "reflect the opinions and demands of employees, expose shortcomings and errors in production work, and fight against violations of Party policies and bureaucratic work styles." These instructions were warmly supported by the majority of employees and the newspaper's editorial department, and more and more people took up the weapon of criticism. However, it soon became apparent that things were not as wonderful as the Party Committee's instructions had described. Some workers complained, "The newspaper is nominally a workers' newspaper, but it's afraid to speak for the workers," "It only says good things and not bad things, just singing lullabies," and "If it criticizes, it only picks on the soft targets!"

These accusations from workers may be somewhat excessive, but they are not without basis. Although the "Shipbuilding Worker's Newspaper" (in 1955, the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company was renamed the State-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company, and the "Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Weekly" was also renamed the "Shipbuilding Worker's Newspaper") was not entirely about reporting good news and not bad, it was indeed difficult to carry out bottom-up criticism in this newspaper. Let's look at the facts.

In the Tool Factory, a worker named Zhou Junfeng had no housing, so he had to borrow shelter everywhere with his mother, wife, and children. His wife even had to give birth in someone else's passageway. To get a room, he ran to the housing section thirty-five times since 1954 and wrote seven applications. The factory's union chairman also wrote three letters of proof for him, but the problem remained unresolved. Last December, he went to the housing section again, but the housing section staff, Li Dongchen and others, were busy discussing how well Cheng Yanqiu sang and how well Yang Baozhong played the huqin, and did not bother to address his problem. Zhou Junfeng had no choice but to find Section Chief Mao. Section Chief Mao impatiently said, "Why are you here again! Your problem is under study. I don't have time, I have things to do outside!" When Zhou Junfeng walked out of Section Chief Mao's office, Li Dongchen sarcastically said, "The young man has quite a procedure, finding the section chief, finding the manager is also useless!" He also said some insulting and abusive words. Based on the workers' feedback, the "Shipbuilding Worker's Newspaper" wrote a short essay criticizing the housing section staff for their irresponsible work and crude attitude towards workers, and also criticized the housing section chief for taking a lenient attitude towards such staff. Not caring about the workers' hardships was a prominent issue at the Dalian Shipbuilding Company, and publishing this article had practical significance. Moreover, the article had been checked for facts with the criticized individuals and had received the approval of the branch and general branch. Despite this, when the editorial department sent it to Manager Yuan Xianqian (a member of the Party Committee) for review before the newspaper went to print, Yuan Xianqian became angry. He called the Party Secretary and said, "It's not good for the newspaper to always do these things (referring to criticism)! We need to 'study the direction of the newspaper!'" The article was suppressed for a week and was only published after important deletions, completely removing the criticism of the housing section chief. Regrettably, the problem remained unresolved after the newspaper's criticism; the housing section even stated that they would not give Zhou Junfeng a room even if they had one! Naturally, such things happened more than once.

If the critical articles were only delayed for a few days and could finally meet the readers after some cuts and trims after being submitted for review, that would not be a bad fate. Even more unfortunate was that some critical articles were discarded or recalled as soon as they were published. Some critical articles, despite reflecting important issues, could never be published. For a period of time, the company's technical security work was done very poorly. The newspaper's editorial department, the Party Committee's Propaganda Department, and the company's Technical Security Section jointly decided to commend the shipyard for its consistent emphasis on safety, and to criticize the fitter shop, repair shop, and machine shop for not paying attention to safety in production. When more than three thousand copies of the issue containing the critical articles had already been printed, Party Secretary Lü Xiyuan discovered that the criticisms mentioned the names of several factory directors. He became agitated, slapped the table and shouted, "Oh dear, this is terrible, they are factory directors, they are Party Committee members, isn't this going to affect the unity of the cadres?" He then ordered all three thousand copies of the newspaper to be scrapped. A little over ten days after this incident, the company had a series of safety accidents, killing two people. Since its founding, the "Shipbuilding Worker's Newspaper" had been discarded or recalled three times after being printed because it contained critical articles.

Since the leaders of this company did not like the newspaper criticizing the section chiefs and factory directors under their leadership, it was only natural that they would not allow the newspaper to criticize themselves. This was indeed the case. One example can illustrate this point. When the shipbuilding company changed from a Sino-Soviet joint venture to Chinese management, Soviet experts, based on new experience in ship repair organization, put forward a complete new program of measures to improve the organization of ship repair and construction work in March 1955, targeting the company's specific situation and problems. Despite this being a major measure to improve the organization of enterprise production, the company's leadership did not earnestly implement it, and some leading cadres did not even know the specific content of the new program. It was not until November 1955, when Minister Huang of the First Ministry of Machine Building came to the company to inspect the implementation of this program, that Manager Yuan Xianqian and Deputy Manager Li Hengsheng became anxious and hastily convened a meeting of the relevant section chiefs, giving them topics and asking them to come up with answers overnight to cope with Minister Huang's "examination." Those who knew the situation were angry at their bad work style of only dealing with inspections from superiors and not doing practical work, and they exposed the problems in implementing the new program. Based on this situation, the "Shipbuilding Worker's Newspaper" wrote a short essay entitled "Manager Takes the Exam." When Party Secretary Lü Xiyuan reviewed the manuscript, he did not dare to show it to the manager and removed the short essay. Later, the manager found out that there was such a short essay. He was not satisfied that the essay was not published, and he insisted on finding out who wrote it and what the "intentions" of the person who wrote it were. He questioned the Party Secretary and raised the issue at the Party Committee meeting. However, his unreasonable questioning was not criticized. Deputy Party Secretary Li Zhu even said without principle, "Just go after Li Guang (the newspaper editor), you'll get it out of him as soon as you go after him."

Because there are many obstacles to carrying out criticism, the newspaper editors have recently come up with a last resort, which is to open a column called "Correct If We Have It," which specializes in publishing articles of criticism that do not specifically target anyone. Only this kind of criticism is more likely to meet the readers.

In recent years, the leading cadres of the Dalian Shipbuilding Company have made achievements in their work. But it would be wrong to become arrogant and complacent because of this, and only want to hear praise and not criticism. It is also wrong to think that only harmony among leading cadres is unity, and that carrying out criticism will undermine unity. It is conceivable that if the company's Party Committee and administrative leaders not only verbally, but also in action, welcomed criticism, supported criticism, and truly listened to the opinions of the workers and masses with an open mind, and at the same time frequently carried out principled criticism among leading cadres, they could have achieved more in their work.

    欢迎批评要看行动
    娄连玲
    中苏造船周报1954年1月创刊的时候，在报上曾经登出了中共中苏造船公司委员会关于办好报纸的指示。这个指示除了要求报纸多多表扬好人好事外，还要求它“反映职工的意见和要求，揭发生产工作中的缺点和错误，向违反党的政策和官僚主义作风作斗争”。这个指示受到了广大职工和报纸编辑部的热烈拥护，越来越多的人拿起了批评的武器。可是不久人们便发现事情并不像党委会的指示所写的那样美妙，有的工人抱怨说：“报纸顶名是工人报，不敢替工人说话”，“光说好的不说坏的，净唱催眠曲”。“要批评，也是专找软的欺！”
    工人的这种指责也许有些过分，但却并非没有根据。因为“造船工人报”（1955年中苏造船公司改为国营大连造船公司，“中苏造船周报”也改为“造船工人报”）虽然不是完全报喜不报忧，可是要在这个报纸上开展自下而上的批评确实是困难重重。让我们看看事实。
    工具厂有个工人叫周俊峰，他因为没有房子住，只好带着母亲、妻、儿到处借宿，他老婆生孩子也是借用了人家的过道。为了要一间房子，他从1954年起跑了三十五次住宅科，写过七次申请书，厂的工会主席也为他写过三次证明信，问题始终没有解决。去年十二月间，他又去住宅科交涉，住宅科的工作人员李栋臣等正忙于议论程艳秋唱的如何，杨宝忠胡琴拉的如何，却不屑于处理他的问题。周俊峰只好去找毛科长。毛科长不耐烦地说：“怎么又来了！你的问题正在研究。我没有时间，有事到外面去办！”当周俊峰从毛科长那里走出来的时候，李栋臣讽刺道：“小伙子挺有章程，找科长，找经理也是白搭！”还说了一些侮辱、谩骂的话。“造船工人报”根据工人的反应，写了一篇小品文，批评了工作不负责任和用粗暴态度对待工人的住宅科工作人员，同时批评了对这种工作人员采取纵容态度的住宅科长。不关心工人疾苦，在大连造船公司是相当突出的问题，发表这篇文章是有现实意义的。而且这篇文章经过向被批评者核对了事实，也得到了支部和总支的同意。尽管如此，当编辑部在报纸付印以前把它送给经理原宪千（党委委员）审查的时候，原宪千却发火了，他打电话给党委书记说：“报纸老是搞这些东西（指批评）不行啊！得‘研究研究报纸的方针！’”这篇文章被压了一个星期，只是在经过重要的删改，把批评住宅科长的部分完全删去以后，才得以见报。遗憾的是，报纸批评以后问题仍然没有解决；住宅科甚至表示，有房子就是不给周俊峰！像这样的事情自然不止一次。
    批评稿件经过送审以后，如果只是积压若干时日和经过砍砍削削，最后还能同读者见面，那还不算很坏的命运。更不幸的是，有些批评稿件刚一见报，报纸就被作废或收回了。有的批评稿件尽管反映了重要的问题，却怎么也见不了报。有一个时期公司的技术保安工作做得很不好。报纸编辑部和党委宣传部及公司技术保安科共同商量，决定表扬一下一贯重视安全的造船厂，同时批评一下不重视安全生产的钳工厂、修船厂和机械厂。在刊登批评稿件的那期报纸已经印了三千多份的时候，党委书记吕锡元发现批评稿中提到几个厂长的名字，他激动起来，拍着桌子叫道：“啊呀呀，这还了得，他们是厂长、是党委委员啊，这不是要影响干部团结吗？”接着就下令把三千多份报纸全部作废。就在这事发生后的十多天，公司接连出现安全事故，死了两个人。“造船工人报”自创刊以来因为刊登批评稿件而在印出后作废，或已经发到工人手中而又收回来的有三次。
    既然这个公司的领导者不喜欢报纸批评在他们领导下的科长和厂长，那末他们不允许报纸批评自己，更是理所当然的了。事实正是如此。举一个例子就可以说明这一点。当造船公司由中苏合营改为我国经营的时候，苏联专家在1955年3月根据新的修船组织工作经验，针对公司的具体情况和问题，提出了一套完整的改进修造船组织工作措施的新方案。尽管这是改进企业生产组织的一个重大措施，公司领导方面却没有认真地贯彻执行，有的领导干部甚至不知道新方案包括哪些具体内容。直到1955年11月间第一机械工业部黄部长到公司来检查这个方案的执行情况，经理原宪千和副经理李衡生才着急起来，仓促地召集有关的科长开会，出了题目，让他们连夜做出答案，来应付黄部长的“考试”。知道这种情况的人，对他们这种光应付上级检查、不做实际工作的不良作风感到气愤，便揭发了贯彻执行新方案中的问题。“造船工人报”根据这种情况写了一篇题为“经理应考”的小品文。党委书记吕锡元在审查稿件的时候，没敢叫经理看，就抽掉了这篇小品文。后来经理还是知道了有这么一篇小品文，他并不因为小品文没有发表而感到满足，一定要追究出这是谁写的，写这篇稿子的人有什么“企图”。他追问党委书记，并且在党委会上提出这个问题来。但是他的无理追问并没有受到批判。党委副书记李柱甚至毫无原则地说：“你就追黎光（报纸主编），一追就追出来了”。
    因为在开展批评方面阻碍很多，近来报纸的编辑想出了一个不得已的办法，就是辟一个叫“有则改之”的专栏，专门发表没有具体批评对象的批评文章。只有这种批评才比较容易同读者见面。
    几年来，大连造船公司的领导干部在工作中是有成绩的。但是如果因此就骄傲自满起来，只愿听表扬不愿听批评，那就错了。如果认为领导干部之间只有一团和气才是团结，开展批评就要破坏团结，那也是错误的。可以设想，要是公司的党委会和行政领导人不只在口头上，而且在行动中欢迎批评，支持批评，真正虚心倾听职工群众的意见，同时在领导干部之间经常开展原则性的批评，他们在工作中原是可以获得更多的成绩的。
