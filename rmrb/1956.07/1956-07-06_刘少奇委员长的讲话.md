Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech

Respected Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen!

Today, at the banquet held by Mr. Sukselainen, Speaker of the Parliament, we have another opportunity to gather with friends and are very honored and pleased.

During their sixteen-day visit to our country, our friends demonstrated their enthusiasm and friendship towards the Chinese people. At the same time, our friends also witnessed the Chinese people's love for peace, their diligent efforts to build their motherland, and their deep friendship towards the people of your country. I believe that through this direct contact between the parliaments of the two countries, the friendly cooperation between China and Finland will become even closer in the future.

On the eve of departure, please allow me to once again express my respect to you and ask the delegation to convey the friendly greetings of the Chinese people to the people of your country.

Please allow me to raise my glass to the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Finland; to the further achievements of our two parliaments in promoting the cause of peace; to the health of the esteemed guest, Mr. Sukselainen, Speaker of the Parliament, and all the ladies and gentlemen of the Finnish Parliamentary Delegation; and to the health of President Kekkonen!

    刘少奇委员长的讲话
    尊敬的议长先生、大使先生、女士们、先生们！
    今天在苏克舍拉宁议长先生举行的宴会上，我们又有机会和朋友们欢叙一堂，感到非常荣幸和愉快。
    朋友们在我国十六天的参观访问中，表现了对我国人民的热情和友好；同时朋友们也看到了我国人民热爱和平、辛勤建设自己祖国的愿望和劳动，以及对贵国人民的深切友谊。我相信，通过这次两国议会之间的直接接触，将使今后中芬两国之间的友好合作更加密切起来。
    在离别的前夕，请允许我再一次表示向你们的敬意，并请代表团把我国人民的友好致意，转达给贵国人民。
    请让我举杯，为中芬两国人民之间的友好合作；为我们两国的议会在促进和平事业中取得进一步的成就；为尊敬的贵宾——苏克舍拉宁议长先生，芬兰议会代表团各位女士和先生们的健康；为吉科宁总统的健康而干杯！
