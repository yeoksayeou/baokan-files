Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 27th. The high-voltage transmission line from Foziling to Hefei has been completed. The electricity from the first hydroelectric power station in the Huai River basin, the Foziling Power Station in Anhui Province, was transmitted to Hefei City, Anhui Province, through this high-voltage line at 10 p.m. on the 25th. From now on, part of Hefei's electricity consumption can be supplied by the Foziling Power Plant, reducing the load on the Huainan thermal power plant, which mainly supplies electricity to the Huainan coal mine, for supplying electricity to Hefei.

The Foziling Hydropower Station currently has two generators with a total power generation capacity of 2,000 kilowatts. They were installed at the end of 1954, and the electricity generated at that time was only used for the basic construction of the reservoir construction area. In order to meet the needs of Hefei's increasingly developed industry for electricity, the 143-kilometer-long Fo-He high-voltage transmission line was erected from December last year to July this year.

At present, the Foziling Hydropower Station is undergoing expansion. It is expected that the expansion project will be completed in the first quarter of next year. At that time, the total power generation capacity of this power plant will increase from the current 2,000 kilowatts to 11,000 kilowatts, and it will be connected to the Huainan thermal power plant and the Meishan, Mozitan, Xianghongdian and other hydropower stations that are being designed or under construction, forming a power grid in central Anhui to supply industrial electricity and key rural irrigation electricity in this area, as well as lighting electricity for cities such as Hefei, Bengbu, and Huainan.

### 佛子岭到合肥高压输电线建成

    佛子岭到合肥高压输电线建成
    新华社合肥27日电　佛子岭到合肥高压输电线已经建成，淮河流域第一个水力发电站——安徽省佛子岭电站的电力，在二十五日晚上十时通过这条高压线送到了安徽省的合肥市。从此，合肥市的部分用电就可以由佛子岭电厂供应，减少了以供应淮南煤矿用电为主的淮南火力发电站对合肥市供电的负荷。
    佛子岭水电站现在拥有发电能力共二千瓩的发电机两台，是在1954年年底安装好的，当时所发电力只是供应水库工区基本建设之用。为了满足合肥市日益发展的工业对于电力的需要，从去年十二月到今年七月架设了全长143公里的佛—合高压输电线。
    目前，佛子岭水电站正在进行扩建。预计扩建工程在明年第一季度可以完工。那时，这个电厂的总发电能力将由现在的两千瓩增加到一万一千瓩，并且将和淮南火力发电站及正在设计或施工的梅山、磨子潭、响洪甸等水力发电站连结起来，构成安徽中部的电力网，以供应这个地区的工业用电和重点农村的灌溉用电，以及合肥、蚌埠、淮南等城市的照明用电。
