The day care center of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee set up two facilities, one for the children of responsible cadres and one for the children of ordinary cadres. In the former day care center, the children were cared for meticulously, with caretakers accompanying them to and from home. In the latter day care center, the conditions were much worse. Some children were simply left unattended. One five-year-old child ran out on their own, crossed the busy streets, and ran home, and the day care center was not even aware of it.

The children of New China are all flowers of the motherland. Why should high and low classes be drawn among them? The comrades in charge of the day care center of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee should dig deep into their own minds and see what is buried there.

    孩子也有高低贵贱？
    中共青岛市委机关日间托儿所办了两个，一个收托负责干部的孩子，一个收托一般干部的孩子。在前一个托儿所里，对孩子照顾得无微不至，朝出夜归都有保育员伴送。而在后一个托儿所里，条件就差得远了，有的孩子根本无人照管，有一个五岁的孩子自己跑出去，通过车马拥挤的街道跑回了家，托儿所还不知道。
    新中国的孩子都是祖国的花朵，为什么要在他们中间划出高低贵贱的等级呢？青岛市委机关主管托儿所的同志应该挖一挖自己的思想深处究竟埋藏着什么东西？
