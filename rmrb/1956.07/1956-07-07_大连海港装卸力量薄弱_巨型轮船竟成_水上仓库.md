    Dalian Port's Weak Loading and Unloading Capacity
    Giant Ships Turned into "Floating Warehouses"
    Dalian Port is one of the largest ports in China's coastal area in terms of throughput. Almost every day, many giant ships enter, leave, and dock here. However, Dalian Port has very few stevedores. Even if all the workers are mobilized, they can only load and unload five ships with five holds. As a result, many ships are moored at the docks for long periods of time, becoming "floating warehouses," causing great waste. Taking a 2,000-ton freighter as an example, it costs more than 7,000 yuan per day to berth. For a 7,000-ton freighter, it costs more than 20,000 yuan per day to berth. This time, our "Peace No. 10" ship arrived at Dalian Port on the 15th, and it was planned to unload the goods within twelve hours. However, it took a full fifty-three hours to unload, causing the country a loss of more than 15,000 yuan. At the same time, the "Beiguang," "Peace No. 5," and "Peace No. 19" ships suffered the same fate, with a total loss of more than 50,000 yuan.
    Due to the long non-productive berthing time, the ships sailing through Dalian Port in the first half of June did not perform well in completing their tasks. The "Peace No. 5," a well-known advanced navigation winning ship of the Ministry of Communications, only completed 30% of its monthly plan. Not even one advanced navigation voyage was created. What is more serious is that many important materials, industrial raw materials, and building materials cannot be delivered to the places where they are needed on time.
    This situation is very serious, and it is hoped that Dalian Port will quickly find a solution.

### 大连海港装卸力量薄弱  巨型轮船竟成“水上仓库”

    大连海港装卸力量薄弱
    巨型轮船竟成“水上仓库”
    大连港是我国沿海吞吐量最大的港口之一，差不多每天都有许多巨型轮船在这里进出和停泊。可是大连港的装卸工人却很少，即使全体工人一齐出动，也只能装卸五艘有五个舱口的轮船。因此许多轮船长时间停泊在码头上，成了“水上仓库”，造成很大的浪费。以两千多吨的海轮计算，停一天就要损失七千多元。以七千吨的海轮计算，停一天就损失两万多元。这一次，我们和平十号轮是十五日抵达大连港的，按计划应在十二小时内把货卸完。但是整整停了五十三小时才卸完，给国家造成一万五千多元的损失。与此同时，遭到同样命运的还有北光、和平五号、和平十九号等轮船，共计损失五万多元。
    由于非生产停泊时间长，六月份上半月航行过大连港的轮船，完成任务的情况都不好。交通部有名的先进航次优胜船——和平五号也只完成月计划的30％。连一个先进航次都没有创造出来。更严重的是，使很多重要物资、工业原料、建筑器材，不能按时送到需要的地方去。
    这种情况是非常严重的，希望大连港迅速设法解决。
