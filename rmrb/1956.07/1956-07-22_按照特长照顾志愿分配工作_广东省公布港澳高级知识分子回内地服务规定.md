Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st - The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee announced on the 20th "Certain Regulations Regarding Senior Intellectuals and Engineering Technicians from Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots Returning to the Mainland to Serve."

According to these regulations, after senior intellectuals and engineering technicians from Hong Kong and Macao compatriots return to the mainland, they will all be assigned appropriate jobs according to the needs of the country and their specialties, and their preferences will be taken into account as much as possible without violating the needs of the work. They will be given as much convenience and support as possible for their studies, research, and experimental work. Regarding salary and benefits, it will generally not be lower than their original salary, or an appropriate assessment will be made in accordance with the national standards for technical personnel. Other benefits, welfare, education, and medical care for themselves and their children will be the same as those for national cadres.

If these personnel bring family members back to the mainland, the government will also provide appropriate jobs for their family members who have technical expertise and work ability. If their family members have temporary difficulties returning and remain in Hong Kong or Macao for a short period, the government will allocate a portion of foreign exchange salary to take care of their living expenses, depending on the actual situation.

When senior intellectuals and engineering technicians from Hong Kong and Macao return to the mainland, if they bring books, instruments, specimens, or other academic materials needed for research and work into the country, they may be imported duty-free after being examined and approved by customs.

According to these regulations, for matters such as contacting and registering for returning to the mainland to serve, relatives and friends in the mainland can be entrusted to the Guangdong Provincial Guangzhou Reception Office for Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots.
