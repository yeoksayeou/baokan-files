    Our Farm Produces Cucumbers This Big
    The "Shandong Prickly Cucumber" grown by the Beijing State-owned Western Suburb Farm is already on the market in large quantities. This cucumber is very large, with the largest being two and a half feet long and two and a half jin in weight. The planned yield per mu is 7,000 jin. In addition to supplying the capital in large quantities, it will also supply other cities.

    我们农场生产这样大的黄瓜
    北京市国营西郊农场种植的“山东刺瓜”已经大量上市。这种黄瓜很大，最大的有二尺半长，二斤半重。每亩计划产量七千斤。除了大量供应首都以外，还将供应其他城市。
