Changchun, July 19th (By our reporter) - More than 18,000 employees of the Changchun State-owned commercial system will enjoy labor insurance benefits starting from July. After the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the state will allocate more than 233,000 yuan in insurance funds each month based on the current wage level. The 730,000 yuan of welfare funds originally extracted from the total wage amount will continue to be allocated by the state.

Whether it is the female employee herself or the wife of a male employee giving birth, a maternity subsidy will be issued; subsidies for disability, old-age care, and death will also be increased.
