Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 11th: Former Kuomintang naval senior officers now in Fuzhou spoke enthusiastically at a symposium held by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the 9th, believing that Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress was of utmost importance. They earnestly hoped that their relatives, old friends, and former comrades-in-arms now in Taiwan would arouse their patriotic hearts and perform meritorious service for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

	Li Shijia, former Deputy Minister of the Kuomintang Navy and Commander of the Second Fleet, and now a member of the CPPCC Fujian Provincial Committee, said: The Kuomintang authorities and military and political personnel in Taiwan should make a prompt decision, break away from American control, and return to the embrace of the motherland to jointly complete the great cause of national reunification.

	Shen Sunyu, former Principal of the Kuomintang Naval Academy, and now a member of the CPPCC Fujian Provincial Committee, said: Many of those who hold positions such as commander and captain in the Kuomintang Navy are my students, some of whom have gloriously revolted and are now contributing to the country. Shen Sunyu hoped that the students who are still in Taiwan today would quickly join the glorious patriotic ranks.

	Han Zhongying, former Major General Deputy Director of the Kuomintang Navy Mawei Shipyard and Major General Director of the Taiwan-Penghu Naval Machinery Department, and now a member of the CPPCC Fujian Provincial Committee, said: In the six or seven years since the mainland's liberation, the motherland's construction in all fields has been advancing by leaps and bounds. He hoped that his naval colleagues in Taiwan would make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Yan Shouhua, former Captain of a Kuomintang naval warship and now a member of the CPPCC Fuzhou Municipal Committee, and Lin Shunfan, former Captain of a Kuomintang naval warship, both believed that the motherland has the strength to liberate Taiwan. They hoped that the military and political personnel in Taiwan would have a sudden change of heart and return to contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

	Chen Hongtai, a former Kuomintang senior officer, also spoke at the symposium.
