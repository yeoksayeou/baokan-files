Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 18th: The Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau recently conducted a widespread Trichomonas vaginalis check-up for more than 15,000 female employees in 87 state-owned, locally state-owned, and some joint state-private factories, and carried out treatment work simultaneously.

So far, many of the more than 1,000 female employees who have received treatment have been cured. Among the thirty-five female workers in Workshop 101 of the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory who suffered from Trichomonas vaginitis, thirty-three have been cured.

In order to further prevent Trichomonas vaginalis infection among female workers, the Parasitology Teaching and Research Group of China Medical University is studying the life cycle of Trichomonas. Many newly built factories have arranged shower facilities for female employees, and some existing factories and enterprises are also changing large bathhouses into showers.
