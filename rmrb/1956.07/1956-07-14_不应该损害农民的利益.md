    Should Not Harm the Interests of Farmers

    Some construction units in Datong City, Shanxi Province, do not follow the state's policies on land requisition and arbitrarily occupy farmland. For example, the Datong Mining Bureau arbitrarily occupied farmland last year. After criticism from relevant departments, they made a self-criticism, but this year they are again occupying farmland without going through the land requisition procedures, even nailing construction signs on farmers' graves and building houses on the gravesites. The farmers are very dissatisfied.

    Also, some construction units arbitrarily pile construction materials in farmers' fields, trampling on the land, flooding the fields at will, destroying the vegetables planted by farmers, or damaging the roads used by farmers, which affects agricultural production. For example, the Datong Engineering Corporation occupied sixteen mu of land belonging to the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative to store materials; the Datong Municipal Engineering Company occupied more than forty mu of cultivated land belonging to the Xinmin and Heping Agricultural Cooperatives to build the Tongquan Highway; the Datong Power Plant Engineering Office, the North China Second Engineering Office, and four other units trampled more than thirty roads on more than five hundred mu of cultivated land; the Second Engineering Section of the Shanxi Provincial First Engineering Company flooded a considerable amount of farmland near the construction site that had just been planted with crops.

    The farmers and local township governments have raised objections to these problems, but these units have not paid attention to them and have not yet corrected their mistakes.

### 不应该损害农民的利益

    不应该损害农民的利益
    山西大同市有些建设单位不按照国家征购土地的政策办理征地手续，擅自占用农民的土地。如大同矿务局去年曾经擅自占用农民土地，经有关部门批评后作了检查，但是今年又不办理征地手续就占用农民土地，还把施工标志钉在农民的坟地上，把房子建在坟地上。农民十分不满。
    还有一些施工单位随便在农民田里堆放建筑器材，踏坏田地，任意放水浸田，拔毁农民所种的蔬菜，或者破坏农民所走的道路，影响了农业生产。如大同工程总公司占了先锋农业社的土地十六亩来存放器材；大同市工程公司修建同泉公路占了新民、和平两个农业社的耕地四十多亩；大同电厂工程处、华北第二工程处等六个单位在五百多亩耕地上踩了三十多条路；山西省第一工程公司第二工区放水把工地附近刚种了庄稼的农田淹了不少。
    这些问题，农民和当地区乡政府都曾提出意见，但是这些单位不重视，直到现在还没有纠正自己的错误行为。		郝维隽  乔应和　张有合
