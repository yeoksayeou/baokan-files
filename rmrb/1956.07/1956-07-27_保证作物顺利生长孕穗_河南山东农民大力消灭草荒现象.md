Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th. Weed infestation is very serious in Henan Province's late autumn crops. This year, the province's more than 80 million mu of late autumn crops were planted in a rush during the rainy June weather. Because agricultural cooperatives were busy with the wheat harvest at the time, late autumn crops were planted without weeding, resulting in a widespread phenomenon of "weeds and seedlings competing for growth" and "weeds taller than seedlings" across the province.

In response to this situation, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and local Party committees have issued instructions demanding the implementation of weeding work.

Currently, many regions have convened autumn field management work conferences centered on weeding, proposing slogans to eliminate weed infestation in three days, five days, or one week. In the Huaibei Plain, Shangcai, Zhengyang, Xiping, SuiPing and other counties mobilized 570,000 people to participate in pulling and hoeing weeds on the 15th and 16th.

After the members of the Xincai County agricultural cooperatives launched a weeding campaign in the order of "first upland, then lowland, first small seedlings, then large seedlings, first many weeds, then few weeds," they cleared the weeds from the autumn fields in just over ten days.

After weeding, the growth of summer-sown corn, millet, soybeans, and other crops in various areas has improved. The corn is already over three feet tall, and the millet is over two feet tall, and both are about to head. Agricultural cooperative members are working hard to apply topdressing fertilizer to promote the growth of these crops during the heading period.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th. Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Shandong Province have universally launched activities to eliminate weed infestation. Agricultural production cooperatives in the Laiyang and Huimin special districts have basically cleared weeds from the fields. Agricultural cooperatives in nine counties, including Wenshang and Jiaxiang, in the Jining special district, arrange farm work according to different weather conditions, organizing members to pull weeds when it is rainy and the ground is wet, and organizing hoeing after the weather clears. In the past week, this cooperative has eliminated weeds from more than 1.7 million mu of land.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of early autumn crops, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are carrying out topdressing and strengthening field management. According to statistics from Huimin, Laiyang special districts, and Junan, Licheng and other counties, more than 80% of spring-sown corn has now been topdressed. At the same time, field management work has been strengthened for the province's nearly 60 million mu of summer-sown crops.

    保证作物顺利生长孕穗
    河南山东农民大力消灭草荒现象
    新华社郑州25日电　河南省晚秋作物的草荒现象很严重。今年，全省八千多万亩晚秋作物都是在六月的阴雨中抢种的。由于当时农业社忙于抢收抢打小麦，地里没有除草就种了晚秋作物，因而全省普遍出现了
  “草苗争长”“草比苗高”的荒田现象。
    针对这种情况，中共河南省委员会和各地党委都曾发出指示要求开展除草工作。
    现在，许多地区都已经召开过以除草为中心的秋田管理工作会议，提出三天、五天或是一周内消灭草荒的口号。淮北平原上的上蔡、正阳、西平、遂平等县在十五、十六两天中出动了五十七万人参加拔草锄草。
    新蔡县农业社的社员们，按照“先岗地，后洼地，先小苗，后大苗，先草多，后草少”的次序，展开锄草运动以后，在十多天中便把秋田中的杂草除净了。
    除草后，各地夏播的玉米、谷子、大豆等作物生长情况已经好转。玉米已经三尺多高，谷子两尺多高，都将要出穗了。农业社社员们正在紧张追肥，以促进这些作物孕穗时期的生长。
    新华社济南25日电　山东省各地农业生产合作社普遍展开了消灭草荒活动。莱阳、惠民两个专区的农业生产合作社，已经基本上清除了田间杂草。济宁专区汶上、嘉祥等九个县的农业社，根据天气阴晴不同情况安排农活，在天雨地湿时，组织社员拔草，天晴以后，就组织锄地。最近一周中，这个社已经消灭了一百七十多万亩地里的杂草。
    为了争取早秋作物丰收，各地农业社正在进行追肥和加强田间管理。据惠民、莱阳专区和莒南、历城等县统计，现在已有80％以上的春播玉米进行了追肥。同时加强了对全省近六千万亩夏播作物的田间管理工作。
