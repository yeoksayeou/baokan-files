Xinhua News Agency, London, July 25th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, during a foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons on July 24th, spoke about the main considerations of current British foreign policy. He said, "The world is moving from a rigid phase to a flexible phase." He stated, "We need more contact, more trade, and more exchange of views. I think that through these, further relaxation and better understanding can be achieved."

Lloyd emphasized that Britain cannot allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, or the Baghdad Pact to "disintegrate." However, he also pointed out that this does not mean that these treaties and organizations should remain entirely as they were in the past. He said, "We believe that the military organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be preserved, while its other activities should also be developed."

In the debate on the 24th, Labour Party leader Gaitskell, speaking on behalf of the opposition party, said that, like Eden, the Labour Party believes that the two most important changes in the current international situation are: the increasing sophistication of nuclear weapons and the "evolution" of the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union has adopted a more flexible attitude, and "we on this side should also adopt a flexible attitude."

Gaitskell expressed dissatisfaction with the signs of "division" within the North Atlantic group, and he believed that the Atlantic countries should "coordinate" their policies. He also criticized the fickleness of Western countries' positions on disarmament.

Former Labour government minister Younger spoke emphatically about the necessity of admitting China into the United Nations. Younger demanded that the Conservative government persuade the United States on this issue and try to get the United States to stop its trade restrictions against China.

The House of Commons debate was adjourned without a vote.

    在英国下院外交政策辩论中
    劳埃德主张增多国际接触和贸易
    盖次克尔批评西方国家在裁军问题上反复无常
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德七月二十四日在英国下院举行的外交政策辩论中谈到当前英国外交政策的主要考虑。他说：“世界正在从僵硬的阶段走向有伸缩性的阶段”。他说，“我们需要更多的接触，更多的贸易，更多的交换意见。我想，通过这些将能达到进一步的缓和和更好的了解。”
    劳埃德强调，英国不能听任北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约或者巴格达条约“瓦解”。但是他同时指出，这并不意味着这种条约和组织应该完全保持过去的模样。他说，“我们认为，北大西洋公约组织的军事组织应当保存，而同时它的其他活动也应当加以发展。”
    在二十四日的辩论中，工党领袖盖次克尔代表反对党发言说，和艾登一样，工党认为目前国际局势中两个最重要的变化是：核子武器日益完善和苏联的“演变”。他说，苏联已经采取了更灵活的态度，“我们这一方同样也应该采取灵活的态度”。
    盖次克尔对北大西洋集团出现“分裂”迹象表示不满，他认为大西洋国家应当在政策上“互相配合”。他还批评了西方国家在裁军问题上的立场反复无常。
    前工党政府大臣杨格在发言中着重谈到了接纳中国进入联合国的必要性。杨格要求保守党政府在这个问题上说服美国，并且设法使美国停止对中国的贸易限制。
    下院辩论在没有进行表决的情况下宣布结束。
