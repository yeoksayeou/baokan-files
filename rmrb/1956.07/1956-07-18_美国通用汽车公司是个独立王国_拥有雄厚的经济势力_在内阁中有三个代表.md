Xinhua News Agency, July 17th, New York dispatch: "General Motors Corporation is an independent kingdom," this is the title of an article published not long ago in the "Nation" weekly by Quinn, former Vice President of another major American company, General Electric.

In the article, Quinn pointed out, when discussing General Motors Corporation's relationship with American financial capital, that General Motors Corporation can borrow from banks in 289 cities across the United States (including all cities with a population of over 350,000). Influential American bankers are willing to support it or promote its products, and they remain silent when issues arise concerning its credibility or monopolistic behavior.

Quinn said that General Motors Corporation's annual income now exceeds 12 billion US dollars, and the money in its treasury is more than the total of the treasuries of forty American states. In this sense, it is several times richer than New York State.

General Motors Corporation owns 119 factories in 64 cities in the United States. Any decision made by its bosses can greatly affect the business of more than 18,000 dealers, 10,000 suppliers, and 500,000 employees, and in fact, it also affects the economy of the entire United States and the capitalist world.

The former Vice President pointed out that General Motors Corporation has three representatives in the Eisenhower Cabinet, which is unprecedented in American history. Due to this privileged position, it is able to anticipate many government decisions. For example, it recently learned in advance about the government's highway construction plan and bought the entire Euclid Road Machinery Company. General Motors Corporation's agents in the U.S. Congress are also demanding that the company's income tax be reduced from the current 52% to 25%, which would increase General Motors Corporation's profit margin from the current 31% to 40%. Even at the current profit margin, General Motors Corporation's profit margin is more than double that of ordinary companies.

Quinn, who is familiar with the inside story of American monopoly capital, pointed out that General Motors Corporation is the world's largest advertiser, spending 100 million US dollars on this aspect each year. "In fact, a significant portion of the income of every magazine, newspaper, radio station, and television station in the United States depends on this large company. Newspapers and radio stations rarely fail to give favorable publicity to issues that affect the interests of the company or its responsible persons." Quinn pointed out that not only General Motors Corporation is like this, but other large companies are also the same. They even have the right to decide whether their employees are loyal to the United States. Quinn lamented: "The American people are unknowingly losing their inherent rights."

Quinn concluded in the article: "The greatest threat to economic freedom in our country (the United States) today is the large corporation—the largest of which is General Motors Corporation."

    美国通用汽车公司是个独立王国
    拥有雄厚的经济势力　在内阁中有三个代表
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：“通用汽车公司是一个独立王国”，这是美国另一家大公司通用电气公司前副总经理奎恩在不久前的一期“民族”周刊上发表的一篇文章的标题。
    奎恩在文章里谈到通用汽车公司同美国金融资本的关系的时候指出，通用汽车公司可以向美国全国二百八十九个城市（包括三十五万人口以上的全部城市）的银行贷款。美国有势力的银行家都愿意支持它或者是推销它的产品，在发生有关它的信誉或者垄断行为的问题的时候，他们就保持缄默。
    奎恩说，通用汽车公司现在每年收入已经超过一百二十亿美元，它的财库出纳的钱比美国四十个州的财政部出纳的钱的总数还要大，在这个意义上讲，它比纽约州还富好几倍。
    通用汽车公司在美国六十四个城市中拥有一百一十九个工厂，它的老板们随便一个决定就可能大大影响一万八千家以上的推销商、一万家供应商的营业和五十万雇员，而且实际上也影响整个美国和资本主义世界的经济。
    这位前副总经理指出，通用汽车公司在艾森豪威尔内阁里有三位代表，这是美国历史上不曾有过的。由于这种近水楼台的地位，它得以预知许多政府决定。譬如，最近它事先知道了政府通过的公路修建计划，就把整个尤克利德筑路机公司买了下来。通用汽车公司在美国国会里的代理人还在要求把公司所得税从目前的52％降低到25％，这样一来就可以使通用汽车公司的利润率从目前的31％增加到40％。即使以目前的利润率说，通用汽车公司的利润率也已经比一般公司的利润率高出一倍有余。
    这个熟悉美国垄断资本内幕的奎恩指出，通用汽车公司是世界上最大的广告主，它每年在这方面要花一亿美元，“实际上美国每一家杂志、报纸、电台和电视的相当大的一部分收入要依赖这一家大公司。对影响到这个公司或者公司负责人的利益的问题，报刊和电台很少不给以有利的宣传的”。奎恩指出，不仅通用汽车公司如此，而且其他大公司也都一样。它们甚至还有权利决定它的雇员是否忠诚于美国。奎恩感慨地说：“美国人民正在不知不觉地失去他们的天赋权利”。
    奎恩在文章里最后说：“我国（美国）国内今天对经济自由的最大威胁就是大公司——其中最大的就是通用汽车公司。”
