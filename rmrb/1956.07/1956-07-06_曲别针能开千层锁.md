    Paperclip Can Open Thousand-Layer Lock
    The 808 thousand-layer lock produced by Guangzhou Huiqun Factory has the words "Strong and Durable, Beautiful and Safe" written on the lock box. From the surface, it really looks strong and durable. However, our Agricultural Products Purchasing Section of the People's Committee of Beipiao County, Liaoning Province, bought five thousand-layer locks, and before they were even used, we discovered that their tumblers were too loose. An ordinary paperclip used for clipping documents can be inserted, and with a twist, the lock can be opened. It serves no locking purpose at all.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Gao Biao of the Electromechanical Installation Engineering Department of the Northeast Coal Mine First Basic Construction Bureau also wrote to say: They bought more than ten 808 thousand-layer locks from the Huiqun Factory, and they could also be opened with a twist of a paperclip.

    曲别针能开千层锁
    广州惠群厂出品的808千层锁，锁盒上写着“坚固耐用、美观安全”八个大字，从表面上看来也真像坚实耐用的样子。可是，我们辽宁省北票县人民委员会农产品采购科买了五把千层锁，还没有使用，就发现它的跳簧太松，用普通别公文的曲别针插进去，拧一下就能拧开，根本起不了锁的作用。

    编者按：东北煤矿第一基本建设局机电安装工程处高标同志也写信来说：他们买了十多把惠群厂的808千层锁，也是用曲别针一拧就拧开了。
