Xinhua News Agency, Accra, July 21st: Parliamentary elections were held in the Gold Coast of West Africa on July 17th, electing 104 members of parliament. According to the final results announced on the 19th, the ruling Convention People's Party won 71 seats, the National Liberation Movement won 31 seats, and independent candidates won 2 seats.

The central issue of the election was what kind of political system the Gold Coast should implement after gaining independence. The Convention People's Party advocated following the United Kingdom and stipulating a centralized system in the constitution, but the National Liberation Movement advocated following the United States and implementing a federal system.

The Gold Coast is a British protectorate in West Africa. Britain had promised that if the Convention People's Party obtained a "real" majority in this election, it would grant the Gold Coast autonomy next year.

    黄金海岸举行议会选举
    新华社21日讯　阿克拉消息：非洲西部的黄金海岸七月十七日举行议会选举，选出议员一百零四人。据十九日公布的最后结果，执政党人民大会党获得七十一席，全国解放运动获得三十一席，无党派人士获得两席。
    选举的中心问题是黄金海岸在取得独立资格后实行什么样的政治制度。人民大会党主张仿效英国，在宪法中规定实行中央集权制，但是全国解放运动却主张仿效美国，实行联邦制。
    黄金海岸是非洲西部的英国的一个保护国。英国曾经答应，如果在这次选举中人民大会党取得“真正”的多数，明年就让黄金海岸自治。
