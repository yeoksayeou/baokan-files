    Unleashing Potential, Supporting the Mainland
    Shanghai Trains Large Numbers of Skilled Workers

    (Our dispatch) To unleash the potential of coastal industrial bases and support construction in the interior, the Shanghai labor department has recently organized over 6,000 apprentices to enter various factories and municipal enterprises for training over the past two months. Some of these apprentices are transferred shop assistants from the commercial sector, while the rest are young people from society, the unemployed, and street vendors. It is estimated that after a year of study, they will reach the level of third-grade skilled workers in metalworking and maintenance for the tobacco, textile, and other industries.

    After entering the factories, these apprentices are welcomed and cared for by enterprise leaders and workers, and appropriate arrangements have been made for their lives and studies.

    Currently, many factories have changed from a one-shift system to a two-shift system in order to accommodate more apprentices. It is estimated that nearly 10,000 more apprentices can be mobilized to enter factories for training in the second half of the year. (Rong Fu)

    发挥潜力，支援内地
    上海培训大批技工
    本报讯　为了发挥沿海工业基地的潜力，支援内地建设，最近两个月来，上海市劳动部门已组织了六千多名学徒进入各工厂和市政企业进行培训。这些学徒有一部分是从商业部门转业的店员，其余是社会青年、失业人员和摊贩。预计经过一年学习以后，他们将达到五金技工和制烟、纺织等保全工三级技工的水平。
    这些学徒进入各厂后，受到企业领导人员和工人的欢迎和关怀，在生活、学习上都作了适当安排。
    目前，有不少工厂为了接受更多的学徒，已把一班制改为二班制。估计下半年可再动员近万名学徒进入各工厂培训。　（荣福）
