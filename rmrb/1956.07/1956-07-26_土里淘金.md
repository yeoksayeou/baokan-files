    Gold Panning in the Soil
    Chen Yichao
    In the courtyard of the Beijing First Smelting Production Cooperative, heaps of waste soil swept out from workshops of various steel factories were piled up. Don't underestimate these valueless waste soils, they contain rich treasures: copper powder, iron powder, and aluminum, lead and other metal scraps. The members of the Beijing First Smelting Production Cooperative pick out copper powder and iron powder from these garbage piles, smelt them into recycled iron, copper ingots, aluminum ingots, etc., and then supply them to factories as production raw materials.
    In a large house, more than a dozen elderly people each held horseshoe-shaped magnets, using them to repeatedly suck out iron powder from piles of waste soil. This is the cooperative's magnetizing group. Liu Chengdong, the head of the magnetizing group and a military dependent, said proudly: "The work of the magnetizing group is very simple, it just requires patience. Young people look down on this work, but we older people are happy to do it, and this is also contributing our share to building socialism."
    Adjacent to the magnetizing group is the copper washing group. There are two large pools in the room, and two female cooperative members are washing copper powder. They use specially made sieves to shake in the pools, washing away soil and other impurities, leaving behind golden copper powder. According to Bai Jinlan of the copper washing group, "One thousand catties of waste soil can wash out six to eight catties of copper powder." This is truly gold panning in the soil.
    The production cooperative also has a copper grinding group. They crush coal cinder containing copper powder (when factories smelt copper, copper is dropped into the coal cinder), and after repeated grinding, sieving, and washing four or five times, the copper powder is washed out of the coal cinder. One hundred catties of copper-containing coal cinder can wash out ten catties of copper powder. In order to expand the production of the copper grinding group and improve production conditions, the production cooperative is installing electric mills. Using electric mills can increase production three to four times per month compared to manual grinding.
    The predecessor of the First Smelting Production Cooperative was the Xisi District Military Dependents Copper and Iron Production Group. In the summer of 1954, the government called on the families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in production. Liu Chengdong, Shan Jixuan and other twelve families of martyrs and military personnel, based on the specific conditions that the families of martyrs and military personnel were either old or young, and lacked production skills, organized a copper and iron picking production group. They borrowed fifty yuan from the government as capital, rented a piece of wasteland, hauled garbage from various factories, and picked out copper, iron and other metal blocks from the waste soil to sell to private iron factories. Later, with the increase of funds and manpower, the production group gradually expanded. In October 1954, a copper smelting furnace was established. In April of last year, a hot blast iron smelting furnace was purchased. After the transition to a cooperative in January of this year, two workshops for sand casting and rolling steel skins were also established. From the establishment of the copper smelting furnace and iron smelting furnace to the end of May this year, more than 150 tons of copper ingots, more than 780 tons of recycled iron, and more than three tons of aluminum ingots, as well as lead ingots, etc., have been produced, and a large amount of capital for expanded reproduction has been accumulated. From the organization of the military dependents copper and iron production group in June 1954 to June of this year, in the past two years, more than 32,000 yuan of capital has been accumulated.

    土里淘金
    陈一超
    在北京市第一熔炼生产合作社的大院子里，堆满了从各钢铁厂车间扫出来的垃圾土。别看这些垃圾土不值钱，里面却蕴藏着丰富的宝物：铜末、铁末和铝、铅等金属碎片。北京市第一熔炼生产合作社的社员们，就从这垃圾堆里捡出铜末、铁末，熔炼成再生铁、铜锭、铝锭等，再供给工厂作生产原料。
    在一间大房子里，十几位老人每人手里拿着马蹄形的吸铁钢，用它一遍又一遍地从一堆垃圾土中把铁末吸出来，这就是生产社的吸铁组。吸铁组长、军属刘成栋很自豪地说：“吸铁组的工作很简单，就是需要有耐心，青年人都看不起这件工作，我们上了岁数的人，却都很乐意干，这也是为建设社会主义尽自己的一分力量。”
    紧连着吸铁组的是洗铜组。屋子里有两个大水池，两个女社员正在淘洗铜末。她们用特制的筛子在水池里摇荡，把土和其他杂质都淘洗干净，剩下的就是黄晶晶的铜末了。据洗铜组白金兰说：“一千斤垃圾土可以洗出六斤到八斤铜末。”这真是土里淘金了。
    生产社还有一个碾铜组，他们把含有铜末的煤渣（工厂化铜时把铜掉进了煤渣）碾碎，经过反复四五次的碾、筛、洗，把煤渣里的铜末洗出来。一百斤含铜煤渣可以洗出十斤铜末。为了扩大碾铜组的生产和改善生产条件，生产社正在安装电磨，使用电磨，每月可以比人工推磨提高生产三、四倍。
    第一熔炼生产合作社的前身，是西四区军属铜铁生产组。1954年夏天，政府号召烈属、军属参加生产，刘成栋、单吉轩等十二户烈属、军属，根据烈属、军属不是老就是小、又没有生产技术等具体条件，组织了一个拾铜铁的生产组，向政府借了五十元作为资本，租了一块荒草地，把各工厂的垃圾拉来，从垃圾土中捡出铜铁等金属块卖给私营铁工厂。以后随着资金和人力的增加，生产组逐步扩大，1954年10月建立了化铜炉，去年四月买了一个热风化铁炉，今年一月转社后，又建立了翻砂和轧钢皮两个车间。从建立化铜炉和化铁炉到今年五月底，已经生产出150多吨铜锭、780多吨再生铁和三吨多铝锭，还有铅锭等，并且积累了大批扩大再生产的资金。从1954年6月组织军属铜铁生产组到今年六月的两年里已经积累了三万二千多元的资金。
