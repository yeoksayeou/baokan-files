    Heroes Build the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    He Chonghuan
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is 668 kilometers long and runs through the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. In the north, it connects with the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the Longhai Railway, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which is continuing to advance westward. In the south, it connects with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Chengdu-Kunming Railway and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, which are under construction. After the completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Southwest, Northwest, North China, East China, Northeast, and Central South regions will be integrated into a whole on the national railway network.
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway passes through high peaks, deep valleys, and rivers. Bridges are connected to tunnels, and tunnels are connected to bridges. There are more than 280 tunnels along the line, with a total length of about 81 kilometers. There are more than 900 large, medium, and small bridges, with a total length of 22 kilometers. The amount of earth and stone excavated and filled is 60 million cubic meters, which, if calculated at a height and width of one meter each, could circle the equator more than one and a half times.
    Not far from Baoji, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is blocked by the towering Qinling Mountains. The Qinling Mountains are majestic, with countless high peaks and deep valleys. The railway has to pass through the Qinling Mountains by winding and spiraling. In the most densely engineered areas, the line forms an "8"-shaped mountain road. Within a section of less than six kilometers, there are more than ten tunnels, accounting for more than 80% of the length of the line. In the Zaoyuan Gully, which is less than 600 meters long, there are nine tunnels and three medium bridges from the bottom of the gully to the mountainside. The bridges and tunnels are only seven Chinese inches apart. Such a highly concentrated construction site has a narrow space, many tasks, and mutual interference. However, if each project is carried out separately, time will not wait. After repeated research, the method of separate construction during the day and night was adopted. The daytime workers worked at higher elevations, and the night shift workers then worked at lower elevations. The most concentrated areas of engineering, such as Zaoyuan Gully, were really busy with construction day and night.
    The Qingshiya and Guanyinshan stations on the Qinling Mountains are both built on cliffs. The entire mountain must be cut off to fill the station site. The high filling and deep excavation project of Qingshiya alone requires more than 600,000 cubic meters of earth and stone within a range of more than 600 meters. To excavate and fill such a large project with manpower in such a narrow space would not only prevent the construction team from spreading out, but also prolong the construction period. With the help of Soviet experts, advanced large-scale blasting methods were used for these two projects. Each blast loaded more than 140 tons of explosives, and another blast loaded more than 300 tons of explosives. Two blasts each blew down more than 200,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, leveling the mountain top. Such large-scale blasting is unprecedented in our country.
    On the Qinling Mountains, dozens of bridges carry the Baoji-Chengdu Railway across deep valleys, most of which are stone arch bridges. These bridges are all built with locally sourced gray-white granite from the Qinling Mountains. They are economical, beautiful, and sturdy. The highest Songshupo Bridge can be compared in height with the Beijing Parachute Tower. Building this bridge was also extremely difficult. After the piers were built, 12,000 arch stones of different sizes had to be laid. The arch laying took place in the rainy autumn season. Thick fog filled the bridge deck. Looking up from under the bridge, nothing could be seen clearly. Even the aerial cable for transporting the arch stones looked like a broken string in mid-air. The transportation above and below the bridge had to be connected by the sound of bells and whistles. After all the hardships, the bridge was built.
    After passing through the five-kilometer-long Qinling Tunnel, the railway runs south along the rolling Jialing River. The Jialing River is like a ribbon blown by the wind, flowing along the foot of the mountains and valleys in winding curves. If the railway were to run straight along one side of the river, it would not only require a large amount of earthwork and tunnel construction, but also the geology in some areas is very bad. If it were to run close to the riverbank, it would be easily damaged by floods. After many comparisons during surveying, it was decided that the entire line would cross the Jialing River sixteen times. After passing Shuangshipu, the Jialing River enters a canyon area. The river is narrow, with large rocks all over the riverbed, and the water flow is turbulent and surging. At first glance, it seems that this was originally a large stone mountain, and the fierce river forced a channel to flow through it. This is the natural barrier of Lingguan Gorge. It is several times more dangerous than the Jianmen Pass and the Mingyue Gorge in the ancient plank road area. The steep cliffs on both sides are staggered and soar into the clouds. The railway passes through the cliffs on the left bank of the river, dozens of meters above the river surface, where even wild goats can hardly stand. Even now, after the line has been built, at first glance, you can only see a hole, and there is no trace of the railway at all. Only those who have walked through here can see the mystery. It turns out that the steep cliff is a series of caves, with three kilometers of tunnels in four kilometers of line.
    In Lingguan Gorge, there is a Monkey Cliff. People who take a few steps on the cliff cannot help but fall down as if standing on a slide. The local villagers say that even clever monkeys can hardly climb up, but the road builders have built a tunnel on Monkey Cliff to allow trains to pass through here.
    In such a steep and dangerous place, people simply cannot walk, so they have to go around dozens of miles of mountains to reach the construction site. Cars have no way to enter, and the food can only be transported by a grain transportation team of 500 people around the mountains. However, this method can only be used temporarily, and it will not work for a long time. Large machinery and road building materials cannot be transported in either. Moreover, once there are floods or wind and snow, the road will be cut off and food will be cut off. Therefore, it is necessary to build a temporary highway on the opposite bank of the river and erect a dense aerial cable network to transport machinery and other road building materials to the construction site.
    The first step in building a temporary highway is to erect countless temporary bridges. However, when building the bridge, even a half-ton pile driving hammer could not be transported in. Without a pile driving hammer, piles could not be driven and bridges could not be built. In desperation, more than 30 workers stepped forward, rolled up their trousers, and braved the sub-zero temperatures to jump into the river. They tied a rope to the pile driving hammer and used the force of the river flow to drag the pile driving hammer to the construction site to build the bridge.
    As soon as the temporary highway crossed the river, it was blocked by the 50-meter-high Pipa Cliff. The Pipa Cliff protrudes from the cliff, without even a slight slope, and the turbulent river flows around it. To allow cars to pass through here, the cliff head must be blown off, and it is difficult to successfully drill holes on such a steep cliff surrounded by water on three sides. Therefore, people pinned their hopes on blasting using natural conditions. The worker Li Wenzhi bravely tied dozens of meters of rope and hung on the cliff to find a place to insert explosives. There was no place to stand on the cliff, and he swayed in mid-air like a plumb bob. After searching for a long time, he found a crack in the rock. The crack was large at the opening, but it became narrower as he went deeper. He took off his cotton coat and continued to explore. Sharp stones cut through his back, and long strips of blood seeped out, but he did not feel pain, because he only had one thing in his mind: how to complete the blasting task. This firm belief enabled him to accurately determine the shape of the crack and return to the residence victoriously. After the leadership agreed, the crack was filled with explosives, and one blast blew off the cliff head of Pipa Cliff, allowing the temporary highway to extend forward in the cliff recess.
    Building a temporary highway is difficult, but building a tunnel on a cliff is even more difficult. To open a tunnel on a cliff, thousands of cubic meters of rock must first be collapsed and the slope must be marked before entering the tunnel. Needless to say, standing on such a cliff, there is not even a place to put your feet. Every day, the workers had to carry an eight-pound hammer, a drill, and a day's worth of dry food, tie on a safety belt, and drill holes in the air. Without a place to put their feet, they wrapped their legs around the ropes and moved forward in a crab-like posture.
    In this difficult environment, the workers also sang their own compiled songs:
      High mountains cannot block the sun,
      Difficulties cannot block heroes.
      We can walk where birds cannot fly,
      We can climb high mountains that apes cannot
          climb;
      As long as we have drills and explosives,
      Trains can still run on the Tianshan Mountains.
    After opening the tunnel entrance and entering the tunnel, new difficulties arose. This is a famous severe earthquake zone. As soon as a wind drill is used and a cannon is fired, the brittle rocks pour down like waterfalls, blocking the pilot tunnel. If it collapses, we will grab it, and if we grab it, it will collapse again. After a long time, everyone gained experience: if a crack is found, it should be supported with wood. Therefore, as soon as you enter the tunnel, you can see dense supports like a forest.
    During the flood season, sometimes a dozen temporary bridges were washed away, and the workers isolated on the construction site lived a life like the "White-Haired Girl." During rest, they slept in the cross-holes of the tunnels and natural caves, covered with straw raincoats and cement bags, and drank mountain spring water when they were thirsty; when they were hungry, they only relied on an aerial cable for transporting simple tools to deliver food. In this environment, the workers put forward the slogan "One inch of tunnel is one inch of happiness" and insisted on working. They also wrote a letter of determination and sent it to the opposite bank, guaranteeing to the Party: as long as we can supply enough wind and drills, we guarantee to open the pilot tunnel ahead of schedule and will never become an obstacle to traffic. With such heroism, they continuously created new records in opening the pilot tunnel.
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is about to be connected. Soon, it will only take one day and one night to travel safely from Baoji to Chengdu by train. As the local people say, now "the road to Shu is no longer difficult, like walking on a plain."

    英雄们修通了宝成铁路
    赫崇焕
    宝成铁路全长668公里、行经陕、甘、川三省，北同天兰铁路、陇海铁路与正在继续向西挺进的兰新铁路接轨，南同成渝铁路及正在修建的成昆铁路、川黔铁路相连。宝成铁路建成后，在全国的铁路网上，西南、西北、华北、华东、东北和中南将结成一个整体。
    宝成铁路所经之地尽是高峰、深谷和江河，桥梁连着隧道，隧道连着桥梁，全线共有隧道280多座，全长约81公里，共有大、中、小桥900多座，全长22公里，单挖填土石方就有六千万方，按高宽各一公尺算，能绕赤道一周半以上。
    出宝鸡不远，宝成铁路便被高大的秦岭拦住。秦岭雄姿巍然，数不尽的高峰深谷。铁路要从秦岭通过，只有缠绕盘旋。工程最密集的地方，线路成“8”字形的盘山道。这里不到六公里的线路内，有十多座隧道，占线路长度的80％以上。在短短不足六百公尺长的枣园沟里，从沟底到山腰就有九座隧道和三座中桥。桥梁和隧道相近只有七公寸。这样高度集中的工点，地方窄，活儿多，彼此干扰。可是一项一项工程分开干，时间又不等人。经过一再研究，才采取了白昼黑夜分别施工的办法。白班的工人在高处施工，晚班的工人接着又在低处干了起来。枣园沟等工程最集中的地方，真是昼夜施工忙。
    秦岭上的青石崖车站和观音山车站，都建在峭壁上。必须将整个山头砍去，才能填平站场。光青石崖的高填深挖工程，在六百多公尺的范围内，就要做土石方六十多万公方，要在这样狭小的地方用人力挖填这样大的工程，不但施工队伍摆不开，而且也会延长工期。在苏联专家的帮助下，这两处工程采用了先进的大爆破方法施工，一炮装炸药一百四十多吨，一炮装炸药三百多吨，两次各炸下二十多万方土石，把山头削成平地，像这样大型的爆破在我国是史无前例的。
    在秦岭上，数十座桥梁载着宝成路越过深谷，其中最多的就是石拱桥。这些桥都是就地取材，利用秦岭山区灰白色的花岗岩建造的。经济、美观又坚固。最高的松树坡大桥，可以同北京的跳伞塔比高。修这座大桥也极不容易，砌起墩台以后，还要砌上一万二千块大小不同的拱石，砌拱时正是雨水连绵的秋季，浓雾弥漫桥台，从桥下向上看，什么也看不清楚，就是运拱石的高空索线，到半空也像断弦一样，桥上与桥下运输只好用钟声和哨音连系，历尽千辛万苦，才将桥砌起来。
    通过五华里长的秦岭隧道，铁路便沿着滚滚的嘉陵江南下。嘉陵江像一条风吹的飘带，曲流拐弯的从山脚、峡谷流着。铁路要在江的一边直着走，不但要做大量的填挖土方和隧道工程，有些地带地质也很坏；要是紧挨江岸走，又容易受洪泛的破坏。勘测时做了多次比较，决定全线要跨过嘉陵江十六次。过双十铺后，嘉陵江进入峡谷地带。江面狭窄，江中遍布大石，水流湍急，汹涌澎湃。猛一看，这里好像原是一个大石山，凶猛的江水硬冲出一个槽子流过去。这就是天险灵官峡。它比剑门天险，古栈道区域的明月峡更险几倍。两岸陡壁错列，耸入云霄。铁路就在江左岸离江面几十公尺高，野羊也难站脚的峭壁上通过。就是现在，线路已经修成了，乍一看，也只能看见一个洞，铁路影踪全无。只有从这里走过的人才能看到其中的奥妙。原来陡壁上是一个山洞接着一个山洞，四公里线路有三公里隧道。
    在灵官峡中有个猴子崖。人在崖上登几步，便不免要像站在滑梯上似的跌下来。当地老乡说，就是伶巧的猴子也难爬上去，可是筑路的工人们，已经在猴子崖上修成隧道，让火车在这里通过。
    这种峭壁险地，人根本没法走，只好绕几十里大山到工地去；车子更没有办法进去，吃的粮食只得靠五百人的运粮大队绕山背运。可是，这种方法只能暂时采用，时间长了是不行的。大型机械、筑路器材也无法运进去。而且，一旦遇到洪水或风雪，更会路断粮绝。所以必须在江对岸修筑汽车便道，再架起密如蛛网的高空索线，才能把机械和其他筑路器材输入工地。
    修筑便道的第一步，是要架起无数座便桥。可是，在架桥时就是一个半吨重的打桩铊也没法向里运，没有打桩铊，就不能打桩架桥。人急生智，三十多个工人便挺身而出，挽起裤腿，冒着零下十度的严寒跳进江里，把桩铊栓上一条绳子，借江水流动的力量，把桩铊拽到工地，架起桥来。
    便道刚过江面，又遇到五十公尺高的琵琶崖迎头拦阻。琵琶崖突出在峭壁上，连一点斜坡都没有，汹涌的江水兜成圈子流过去。要使汽车在这里通过，一定要把崖头炸掉，而在这样三面临水的陡峭悬崖上打炮眼，是难以成功的。所以人们把希望都寄托在利用自然条件爆破上。工人李文治勇敢地系上几十公尺的绳子，悬在崖上寻找能塞进炸药的位置。崖上没立脚的地方，他就像一个秤铊似的摇幌着悬在半空。找了半天，才在石崖中发现一条石缝。他挤到石缝中去探索。石缝口还大，可是愈往下探愈窄，他脱去棉衣又往里探，尖石划破他的脊背，渗出一长条一长条的血迹，他也不觉得疼痛，因为他心里只有一件事：怎样完成爆破任务。这种坚定的信念，使他准确地测定出石缝的形势，胜利返回住地。经领导同意后，将石缝塞满炸药，一炮便把琵琶崖的崖头炸掉，让汽车便道在崖凹中伸向前去。
    修筑汽车便道困难，在峭壁上修隧道更是困难。在峭壁上开辟隧道首先要崩下几千方岩石，划好仰坡，才能进洞。这种峭壁上不用说站人，连个登脚的地方都找不到。工人们每天只好背起八镑锤、炮钎，带上一天吃的干粮，系上安全带，悬空打眼。没有登脚的地方，就用双腿盘着绳索，用螃蟹爬行的姿式向前移动。
    在这种艰苦的环境下，工人们还唱着自己编的歌子：
      山高挡不住太阳，
      困难挡不住英雄。
      鸟飞不过的地方我们能走，
      猿猴爬不上的高山我们能攀
          登；
      只要有钢钎和炸药，
      在天山上火车也照样行。
    开辟出洞门，进了洞，新的困难又出现了。这里是著名的严重地震区。一打风钻一放炮，发酥的岩石像瀑布般的倾泻下来，把导坑堵满了。塌了就抢，抢了又塌。时间一久，大家摸出经验来：发现有一点裂纹就用木头支住。所以一进洞，就能看到密密麻麻像森林一样的支撑木。
    在洪水泛滥期间，有时十几座便桥全被冲垮，隔在工地上的工人就过着“白毛女”一样的生活，休息时睡在隧道的横洞和天然的石洞里，盖着蓑衣和洋灰袋，渴了便喝山中的泉水；饿了只靠一条运送简单工具的高空索线输送饭菜。在这种环境下，工人们提出了“进一寸隧道，就是一寸幸福”的口号，坚持工作。并写决心书捎到对岸，向党保证：只要能供足风和钢钎，我们保证提前打通导坑，决不当通车障碍。他们就以这样的英雄气概接连不断的创造了开挖导坑的新纪录。
    宝成铁路快要接轨了。不久之后，从宝鸡到成都，坐火车只用一昼夜就可以安全到达，正像当地人民所说的，现在是“蜀道不难，如履平川”了。
