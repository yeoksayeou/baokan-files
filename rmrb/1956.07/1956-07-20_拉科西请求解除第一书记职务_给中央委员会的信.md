Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 19th: TASS reported from Budapest on the 19th that a letter from Comrade Mátyás Rákosi to the Central Committee of the Party was read at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, which opened on July 18th. The content of this letter is as follows:

    Beloved Central Committee!
    I request the Central Committee to relieve me of my position as First Secretary of the Central Committee and to allow me to withdraw from the Political Bureau. One of the reasons I am making this request is that I am already sixty-five years old, and I have been ill for two years, and my condition is getting worse, and the illness prevents me from performing the duties entrusted to me as First Secretary of the Central Committee. At the same time, the mistakes I have made in the area of the cult of personality and in the socialist legal system make it difficult for the Party leadership to fully focus its attention on the tasks we face. I request to be relieved of my current duties, and I am willing to serve our Party, the working people, and the great cause of socialism.
              Mátyás Rákosi
    On the same day, Mátyás Rákosi made the following statement at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party:

    Beloved Central Committee!
    Please allow me to add a few supplementary explanations to my request. Regarding my health, I have suffered from high blood pressure for two years.
    My blood pressure is too high. A few days ago, the doctors gave the Political Bureau a report, and I now quote one sentence from it:
    "We believe that Rakosi's current health condition is completely unsatisfactory, and therefore request immediate attention to prevent his health from deteriorating."
    In the past two years, comrades have often said that I no longer go to enterprises and among the masses as often as I used to.
    Their opinions are correct. They just don't know that the reason for this is the deterioration of my health. My health condition has begun to affect the quality and quantity of my work, and in such an important position, this can only harm the Party. That is what I want to say about my health.
    As for the mistakes I committed in the cult of personality and the undermining of the socialist legal system, I have repeatedly acknowledged these mistakes at the plenary session of the Central Committee in June 1953 and in the period thereafter, and have publicly made self-criticism regarding these mistakes. After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Khrushchev's report, I began to realize that the seriousness and impact of these mistakes were greater than I had realized, and the losses these mistakes brought to the Party were more serious than I had previously imagined. These mistakes created difficulties for our Party's work, weakened the appeal of the Party and the people's democratic system, hindered the development of the Leninist principles of collective leadership in Party life, hindered the development of constructive criticism and self-criticism, hindered the development of democracy in Party life and national life, and hindered the development of the initiative and creative power of the broad masses of working people. Finally, these mistakes provided the enemy with a very broad space for attack. All the mistakes I made during my tenure in the Party's extremely important position have caused serious losses to our entire socialist development.
    I should have worked harder to correct these mistakes. The work of rehabilitation in the past was slow and sometimes even interrupted. The work of eliminating the cult of personality was somewhat stagnant last year. Criticism and self-criticism, as well as collective leadership, were developed slowly. The struggle against sectarian and dogmatic views and methods was not resolute enough, and I, as the First Secretary of the Party, should bear a major responsibility for all of this.
    Beloved Central Committee!
    I have been an active soldier in the socialist movement for more than forty years. I was present when our Party first started its activities. I participated in the battles of the Hungarian Commune and in the arduous struggle against the Horthy terror. After a long prison life, I waited for the powerful Soviet Union to liberate our motherland. When the Hungarian Communists waged a tenacious and arduous struggle to achieve the victory of the great socialist cause in our country, I walked at the forefront of them. I believe that our Party, relying on the working people, will now work together in the spirit of the 20th Congress to overcome all difficulties, defeat the enemy, and be able to strengthen itself in the struggle and advance along the road to a bright future of democratic and socialist construction!

### 拉科西请求解除第一书记职务  给中央委员会的信

    拉科西请求解除第一书记职务
    给中央委员会的信
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社布达佩斯十九日讯：在七月十八日开幕的匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议上宣读了马加斯·拉科西同志致党中央委员会的信。这封信的内容如下：
    敬爱的中央委员会！
    我请求中央委员会解除我的中央委员会第一书记的职务，并且让我退出政治局。我提出这项请求的原因之一就是，我已经六十五岁了，我患病也已经有两年了，并且病情越来越严重，疾病妨碍我执行委托给我的中央委员会第一书记的职务。与此同时，我在个人崇拜以及在社会主义法制方面所犯的错误也使党的领导难于有可能把自己的注意力完全集中到我们所面临的任务上。我请求解除我现在担任的职务，我愿意为我们党、劳动人民、社会主义的伟大事业服务。
              马加斯·拉科西
    同一天，马加斯·拉科西在劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议上发表了下述声明：
    敬爱的中央委员会！
    请允许我对我这项请求作几点补充说明。谈到我的健康情况，我患高血压病已经有两年了。
    我的血压过高，几天以前医生们曾经给政治局一个报告，我现在引述其中的一句：
    “我们认为拉科西目前的健康状况是完全不能令人满意的，因此请求立即予以过问，以便制止他的健康的恶化。”
    在最近两年来，同志们常常说，我已经不像从前那样经常地到企业、到群众中去了。
    他们的意见是对的。他们只是不知道，这件事的原因是我的健康情况的恶化。我的健康情况开始影响我的工作的质量和数量，在这样重要的职位上这只会给党带来害处。这就是我要谈的我的健康情况。
    至于我在个人崇拜和破坏社会主义法制方面所犯的那些错误，我在1953年6月中央委员会全体会议上和在以后的一个时期中也一再承认了这些错误，并且就这些错误公开地作了自我批评。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和赫鲁晓夫同志作了报告之后，我开始明白，这些错误的严重性和影响比我所认识的要大，由于这些错误而给党带来的损失比我以前想像的要严重得多。这些错误给我们党的工作造成了困难，减弱了党和人民民主制度的吸引力，妨碍了集体领导的党的生活的列宁主义准则的开展，妨碍了开展建设性的批评和自我批评，妨碍了发扬党的生活和国家生活的民主，妨碍了发扬广大劳动人民的主动性和创造力量。最后，这些错误给敌人提供了进行攻击的十分广阔的场所。我在担任党的极其重要的职位时期所犯的所有的错误给我们整个社会主义发展带来严重的损失。
    为了纠正这些错误，我是应当更加努力的。过去恢复名誉的工作进行迟缓，有时甚至于中断了，消除个人崇拜的工作去年曾经有些停顿，批评和自我批评以及集体领导展开得缓慢，反对宗派主义和教条主义的观点和方法的斗争进行得不够坚决，这一切应该由作为党的第一书记的我负重大的责任。
    敬爱的中央委员会！
    我作为社会主义运动的一名积极的战士已经四十多年了。我们党刚开始活动的时候就有我在场，我参加了匈牙利公社的战斗，参加了反对霍尔蒂恐怖的艰苦斗争。经过了长期监狱生活后，我等到了强大的苏联解放了我们祖国。当匈牙利共产党员进行顽强艰苦的斗争，使伟大的社会主义事业在我国取得胜利的时候，我走在他们的前列。我相信，我们的党依靠劳动人民，现在将同心协力地本着第二十次代表大会的精神克服一切困难，战胜敌人，并且能够在斗争中得到加强，沿着通向美好未来的、民主和社会主义建设的道路前进！
