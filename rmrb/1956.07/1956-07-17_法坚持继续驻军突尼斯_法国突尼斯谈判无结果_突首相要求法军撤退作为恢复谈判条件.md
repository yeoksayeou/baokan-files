Xinhua News Agency, July 14th, Paris Dispatch: The Tunisian-French negotiations on the issue of mutual relations between the two countries, held in Paris, were interrupted on July 13th.

    The negotiations were interrupted at the request of the Tunisian side. The Tunisian Embassy in France, in a statement quoting Tunisian Deputy Prime Minister Radham, who participated in the negotiations, said that the Tunisian delegation made this decision due to the unfriendly attitude of the French Senate and the statement made by French Foreign Minister Pineau in the National Assembly.

    During the negotiations, Tunisia insisted on disagreeing with the indefinite stationing of French troops in Tunisia, while Pineau, in a speech to the National Assembly on the 12th, reiterated his refusal to withdraw French troops from Tunisia.

    Agence France-Presse also reported that the French Senate passed a proposal on the 11th, believing that French financial aid to Tunisia should be used to help compensate for the losses of French residents in Tunisia. "This vote particularly annoyed the Tunisian delegation."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, July 15th, Tunis Dispatch: Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba delivered a radio address in Tunis on July 14th, condemning France's insistence on stationing troops on Tunisian territory.

    In his speech, Bourguiba explicitly pointed out: "The withdrawal of French troops is a prerequisite for any negotiations, because there can be no effective negotiations if the two sides are not on an equal footing." He stated that he would refuse to resume negotiations as long as France continues to insist on occupying part of Tunisian territory.

    法坚持继续驻军突尼斯
    法国突尼斯谈判无结果
    突首相要求法军撤退作为恢复谈判条件
    新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：在巴黎举行的突尼斯同法国关于双方相互关系问题的谈判七月十三日中断。
    谈判是突尼斯方面要求中断的。突尼斯驻法大使馆在声明中引用参加谈判的突尼斯副首相拉德哈姆的话说，由于法国参议院的不友好态度和法国外交部长比诺在国民议会发表的声明，突尼斯代表团做出了这个决定。
    突尼斯在谈判中坚持不同意法军无限期驻在突尼斯，而比诺在十二日向国民议会发表的演说中，重申了不准备把法军撤出突尼斯的主张。
    法新社消息还说，法国参议院在十一日通过建议，认为法国给突尼斯的财政援助应该用来协助赔偿突尼斯境内法国居民的损失，“这次表决特别使突尼斯代表团感到恼火。”
    据新华社15日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯首相布尔吉巴七月十四日在突尼斯发表广播演说，谴责法国坚持要在突尼斯领土上驻军的态度。
    布尔吉巴在演说中明确指出：“法国军队的撤退是任何谈判的先决条件，因为，如果双方不是处在平等地位，就不可能有有效的谈判。”他表示，只要法国仍然坚持要占领突尼斯的一部分领土，他就拒绝恢复谈判。
