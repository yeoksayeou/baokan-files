On Tian Jian's Poetry
Xuan Zhu

Someone criticized Tian Jian's recent work—the street poem "Sing, Youth!" (poem appearing in "China Youth" this year, issue number 7), believing that these poems only made people "feel the emptiness in the poet's heart, and a cold attitude towards actual life and actual struggle." Then they concluded, "This is the result of the poet detaching himself from actual life and actual struggle, and the weakening of political enthusiasm."

I have also repeatedly read Tian Jian's group of poems; I also don't think they are good poems. But I haven't felt that it's merely "the emptiness in the poet's heart, and a cold attitude towards actual life and actual struggle." Therefore, I cannot agree with "This is the result of the poet detaching himself from actual life and actual struggle, and the weakening of political enthusiasm."

This is also a popular formula recently. For the recent works of old poets who once wrote good poems, but have lost their brilliance, people always add such a judgment: "This is the result of the poet detaching himself from actual life and actual struggle, and the weakening of political enthusiasm."

Is the truth really that simple? I think it's not necessarily so.

Especially, this label cannot be attached to all old poets who have not written good recent works. Because "every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

As for Tian Jian, I think he has been experiencing a creative "crisis" in recent years: he hasn't found (or is painstakingly seeking) a suitable way of expression, so he often seems unable to express himself smoothly, and sometimes he seems to be straining his neck and shouting desperately.

One of the characteristics of a poet is that whatever song he sings (here mainly referring to the content), there must be a corresponding and harmonious tune (here mainly referring to the form). Tian Jian's works during the Anti-Japanese War achieved consistency between content and form, which was the rhythm and angry emotions that Wen Yiduo called "drumbeats." The form of this kind of poem, it must be said, is somewhat imitating Mayakovsky. However, because the structure of Russian and Chinese characters are very different, it goes without saying that this imitation is very far-fetched, and sometimes even a little ridiculous. Tian Jian probably realized this, so he later discarded this coat that had once made him strut onto the stage, but unfortunately he has repeatedly tried to tailor new clothes, but has not yet found the most suitable one.

The relationship between form and content cannot be absolute, but it cannot be ignored either; especially in poetry. Recently, there has been a lively discussion about Li Houzhu's lyrics. Let me take lyrics as an example. Li Houzhu's lyrics are all short verses, which is consistent with his content. If you want to use "Yu Meiren" or "Lang Taosha" tunes to accommodate content like General Xin's vastness of history, and the sound of metal and horses, it will be useless.

Poets of our era, compared to prose writers, have an extra task, which is the creation of poetic form. In other words, poets of our era, if they don't have a unique personal style, and seek to shine brightly for a long time, it may not be very possible. Some poems seem to have quite a lot of enthusiasm and imagination, but in reality, it's because they are written long; to win by length cannot be considered a style.

    关于田间的诗 
    玄珠
    有人批评了田间的近作——街头诗“唱吧，青年人！”（诗见于“中国青年”本年第七期）认为这些诗使人“感到的，只是诗人心灵上的空虚，对实际生活、实际斗争的冷淡的态度；”然后下了结论道，“这是诗人脱离了实际生活、实际斗争，政治热情减弱了的结果。”
    我也曾把田间这组诗，反复读过；我也不认为这是好诗。但是也还不曾感到，这只是“诗人心灵上的空虚，对实际生活、实际斗争的冷淡的态度。”因而我也就不能同意“这是诗人脱离了实际生活、实际斗争，政治热情减弱了的结果。”
    这也是近来流行的公式，对于曾经写过好诗的老诗人的失去了光采的近作，总是加上这么一个判断：“这是诗人脱离了实际生活、实际斗争，政治热情减弱了的结果。”
    事实就是这样简单么？我以为未必然。
    尤其不能把这一个标签贴到一切没有写出好的近作的老诗人的身上。因为“每个不幸的家庭，其不幸的原因各不相同。”
    就田间而言，我以为他近年来经历着一种创作上的“危机”：没有找到（或者是正在苦心地求索）得心应手的表现方式，因而常若格格不能畅吐，有时又有点像是直着脖子拚命地叫。
    诗人的特点之一，是他唱的什么歌（这里主要指内容），不能不有相应的、和谐一致的什么调（这里主要指形式）。田间在抗战时期的作品，内容和形式是取得一致的，这就是闻一多称之为“鼓声”那样的节奏和愤怒的情绪。这种诗的形式，不必讳言，有点模仿马雅可夫斯基。然而因为俄、汉文字构造的大不相同，勿庸讳言，这种模仿是十分牵强的，有时甚至有点可笑。田间大概觉到了这一点，所以后来他就丢掉了这件曾经使他雄纠纠地跳上台来的外套，但不幸是他屡次试裁新装，却还没找到最称身的。
    形式与内容的关系，不能使之绝对化，但也不能忽视；特别在诗。近来曾经热闹地讨论过李后主的词，我请以词为例。李后主的词都是小令，这和他的内容是吻合的。如果要辛将军那样的上下古今，金戈铁马的内容来牵就“虞美人”、“浪淘沙”那样的词调，就将一无是处。
    我们这时代的诗人，比起散文作家来，多一重任务，即是诗的形式的创造。换言之，我们这时代的诗人，如果不是独具个人的风格，而求光采长耀，也许是不大可能的。有些诗，似乎颇有热情，有想像，但实在也因为它写得长；以长取胜，算不得风格。
