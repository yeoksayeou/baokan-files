Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee invited democratic figures from various regions to a symposium in Beijing from the 2nd to the 4th to discuss united front work and other related issues. Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, asked everyone at the meeting to frankly raise questions, opinions, and criticisms regarding united front work in order to improve work and strengthen unity.

The participants in the symposium included responsible persons of democratic parties from various provinces and cities, non-Party responsible persons of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and non-party democratic figures from various sectors, all of whom were representatives who had not yet returned to their original locations after attending the Third Session of the First National People's Congress. Some responsible persons from the National Committee of the CPPCC and the central committees of various democratic parties also participated in the symposium. There were over two hundred participants in total.

Many responsible persons of local organizations of democratic parties felt excited about the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and democratic parties proposed by the CPC Central Committee. At the same time, they also felt that the democratic parties had a "long way to go" in the future. They unanimously expressed that they would better play an active role in the future, unite all forces that can be united, and jointly serve the socialist cause. In order to adapt to the new situation, everyone believed that the ideological awareness of members of democratic parties should be further enhanced, and their organizations should be further developed and consolidated. They requested the Communist Party to strengthen its leadership over the democratic parties.

Many responsible persons of local organizations of democratic parties stated at the meeting that in the past few years, the various democratic parties had achieved great results in their work, which were inseparable from the help of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, they also criticized some shortcomings in the unity and cooperation between some Communist Party organizations and Communist Party members and the various democratic parties. Many active suggestions were also put forward at the meeting.

They pointed out that some united front departments of the Communist Party and grass-roots organizations in some organs and schools provided little political assistance to the democratic parties and had a narrow range of contacts. Some people criticized certain CPC organizations for "providing more care in life but less political assistance" to democratic figures. Some people criticized Communist Party members for being accustomed to conducting self-criticism within the Party and that in the future, they should carry out criticism and self-criticism together with non-Party people to jointly improve shortcomings in working relationships. Someone said that they wanted to discuss matters with the person in charge of the United Front Work Department, but they often could not find anyone. Some people also criticized local organizations of democratic parties for not having a sense of initiative, looking for the United Front Work Department for everything, and instead should take the initiative and be proactive. Some people requested that more publicity be given to the activities of democratic parties in the future, and suggested that local newspapers should publish the activities and work experience of various democratic parties in a certain amount of space in order to attract everyone's attention and support for the work of democratic parties.

When talking about political consultation work, people from Shanghai, Shandong, and other places pointed out that the CPPCC organizations in these places, especially in the past one or two years, have played a very good role, their work is active, and they have close ties with democratic parties and democratic figures. Everyone can speak freely, and various issues can generally be fully consulted. Some responsible persons of the provincial and municipal committees of the People's Political Consultative Conference also criticized the shortcomings in the local CPPCC work, such as insufficient attention to the role of the CPPCC and a lack of regular work; some Communist Party members and democratic figures regarded the CPPCC organization as an agency for supporting and settling some people. Therefore, the CPPCC meetings are bustling with activity, but after the meetings, they are deserted. For example, the CPPCC's work lacks a proactive attitude to carry out other than responding to the central government's call; some Communist Party members do not give enough respect to the opinions of democratic figures when consulting with them and lack a democratic style. Many people pointed out that the work of local CPPCCs has a lot of formalism, and at the same time, the working bodies of the CPPCC are unsound and there are very few cadres. At the meeting, many people put forward specific suggestions for improving the work of the CPPCC in the future. Someone at the meeting advocated that the role of the People's Political Consultative Conference in supervising national affairs should be expressly stipulated in the Charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Some non-party democratic figures criticized some Communist Party members for not giving enough care and attention to non-party democratic figures. They proposed that the Communist Party should maintain close contact with them through appropriate forms, help them do their work well, and better unleash their potential and enthusiasm. Some people suggested that this contact should be maintained in the form of regular or irregular symposiums in the future. At the meeting, some non-party democratic figures also raised criticisms about some national organs and schools for using some senior intellectuals improperly, not providing enough care, and providing little assistance.

Li Weihan said at the meeting that some people think that democratic parties are not needed after the victory of socialist transformation, but this idea is wrong. With the great victory of socialist transformation in our country, the Chinese Communist Party has clearly put forward the policy of long-term coexistence with various democratic parties. He said that various democratic parties accept the leadership of the Communist Party, but the organizations of various democratic parties themselves should maintain their political freedom and organizational independence. Only in this way can the active role of various democratic parties be better brought into play. The Communist Party's leadership is realized through its correct political propositions and political line. And this political proposition can only be accepted by everyone after it has been publicized, practiced, and fully consulted with various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures. The Chinese Communist Party must never impose its political views on others.

Li Weihan sincerely accepted the criticisms and opinions raised by everyone at the meeting, and made self-criticism on some shortcomings such as insufficient respect for the opinions of democratic parties and non-party democratic figures by some united front departments. He said that united front work is everyone's work, and in the future, everyone is required to work together to do the united front work well.

Regarding the questions, opinions, and criticisms raised at this symposium, Li Weihan said that the United Front Work Department will conduct serious research with the central committees of various democratic parties and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference after the meeting, propose specific solutions, and further improve our work.

    各地民主人士在中共中央统战部座谈会上
    对统战工作提出批评建议
    新华社6日讯　中共中央统一战线工作部从二日到四日在北京邀请各地民主人士座谈统一战线工作和其他有关的问题。中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉在会上请大家对统一战线工作坦率地提出问题、意见和批评，以便改进工作，加强团结。
    参加座谈会的有各省、市民主党派负责人，人民政协各省、市、自治区委员会党外负责人和各界无党派民主人士，都是参加第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议后尚未返回原地的代表。人民政协全国委员会和各民主党派中央一部分负责人也参加了座谈。参加座谈会的共有二百多人。
    许多民主党派地方组织的负责人对中共中央提出的共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，感到兴奋，同时也感到今后民主党派“任重道远”，他们一致表示今后要更好地发挥积极作用，团结一切可以团结的力量，共同为社会主义事业服务。为了适应新的形势，大家认为民主党派成员的思想觉悟应有进一步的提高，组织上应有进一步的发展和巩固。他们要求共产党加强对民主党派的领导。
    许多民主党派地方组织的负责人在会上谈到几年来，各民主党派在工作中取得了很大的成绩，这都是和中国共产党的帮助分不开的。同时，他们也在会上批评了有些共产党组织和共产党员在同各民主党派团结合作中存在的一些缺点。会上还提出了许多积极性的建议。
    他们指出，共产党的某些统战部门和某些机关、学校中的基层组织对民主党派在政治上帮助少，接触面较窄。有些人批评某些中共组织对民主人士“生活上照顾多，政治上帮助少”。有些人批评共产党员习惯于在党内进行自我批评，今后应该和党外人士一起开展批评和自我批评，共同改进工作关系中的缺点。有人说，有事想和统战部负责人商量，但是经常找不到人。有些人也批评民主党派地方组织不应当存在依赖心理，事无巨细都找统战部，而应当自己发挥主动性积极性。有些人要求今后对民主党派的活动要多加宣传，建议地方报纸应以一定的篇幅刊载各民主党派的活动、工作经验，以引起大家重视和支持民主党派的工作。
    在谈到政治协商工作时，上海、山东等地人士指出，政协组织在这些地方特别是最近一两年来发挥了很好的作用，工作活跃，同民主党派、民主人士联系密切，大家都能畅所欲言，各种问题一般都能进行充分协商。有些人民政协省、市委员会负责人同时也批评了当地政协工作中存在的缺点，如对政协的作用重视不够，缺乏经常工作；有些共产党员和民主人士把政协组织看成是一个养活和安顿一部分人的机关。因此，政协开会时轰轰烈烈，闭会后冷冷清清。又如政协的工作除了响应中央号召以外，缺乏积极的态度去开展；有些共产党员在和民主人士协商问题时，对他们的意见尊重不够，缺乏民主作风。不少人指出，地方政协的工作，形式主义比较多，同时政协的工作机构不健全，干部也很少。对今后改进政协工作方面，会上有许多人提出了具体建议。有人在会上主张，人民政协要对国家事务起监督作用这一点，应该在中国人民政协章程中明文规定出来。
    有些无党派民主人士在会上发言时，批评有些共产党员对无党派民主人士关怀和重视不够。他们提出，共产党应该通过适当的形式密切同他们联系，帮助他们做好工作，更好地发挥潜力和积极性。有的人建议，今后以一种定期的或不定期的座谈会的形式来密切这种联系。会上还有一些无党派民主人士就某些国家机关和学校对一些高级知识分子使用不当、照顾不够、帮助少等缺点，提出了批评意见。
    李维汉在会上说，有人认为社会主义改造胜利后民主党派就不需要了，这种想法是不对的。随着我国社会主义改造的伟大胜利，中国共产党已明确地提出了同各民主党派长期共存的方针。他说，各民主党派接受共产党的领导，但是各民主党派组织本身应该保持它们的政治自由和组织独立。只有这样，才能更好地发挥各民主党派的积极作用。共产党这种领导，是通过它的正确的政治主张和政治路线来实现的。而这种政治主张又只有经过它的宣传、实践以及同各民主党派和无党派民主人士充分协商得到大家同意后，才能为大家所接受。中国共产党绝不能将自己的政治见解强加于人。
    李维汉在会上表示诚恳地接受大家提出的批评和意见，并且就某些统战部门对民主党派和无党派民主人士的意见尊重不够等缺点，作了自我批评。他说，统一战线工作是大家的工作，今后要求大家共同来把统一战线工作作好。
    关于这次座谈会上提出的问题、意见和批评，李维汉说，统战部在会后将和各民主党派中央和人民政协全国委员会分别进行认真的研究，提出具体解决的办法，来进一步改进我们的工作。
