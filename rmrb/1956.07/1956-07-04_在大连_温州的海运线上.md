Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 3rd. The new upsurge in national industrial and agricultural production this year has led to a corresponding increase in maritime transportation. In the first half of the year, on the long sea route from Dalian in the north to Wenzhou in the south, ships of the Shanghai Maritime Administration traveled back and forth continuously, transporting 27% more goods than in the same period last year, creating the highest record of semi-annual cargo volume since liberation.

This year, oil tankers transported crude oil from the Yumen Oilfield for the first time, and have already transported nearly 50,000 tons of crude oil from Lianyungang to the Shanghai refinery. In the past six months, iron ore from the Ma'anshan, Zhejiang Lizhu, and Guangdong Yingde mining areas has been transported by inland river vessels and trains to coastal ports, and then continuously shipped to Anshan in the Northeast by sea, with a total volume more than one-fifth higher than the entire year of last year; the amount of steel produced by Shanghai steel factories and transported outward via coastal routes has also exceeded 12% of the total for the whole of last year.

In the first half of the year, the sea transport of agricultural tools, pesticides, and fertilizer also increased, with more than 23,000 tons shipped from Shanghai port alone. Grain and cotton from the countryside were continuously transported by sea to coastal industrial cities, with a total volume more than 30,000 tons higher than in the same period last year.

In the first half of the year, during the foggy season at sea, the sailors overcame the heavy fog, ensuring the safe navigation of the ships at all times. They also adopted methods such as raising the waterline of ships and having small cargo ships tow sailing ships, greatly increasing transportation capacity.

    在大连——温州的海运线上
    新华社上海3日电　今年全国工农业生产的新高涨，使海上运输也跟着繁忙起来。上半年，在北起大连南到温州的漫长航线上，上海海运管理局的船只往返不断，运输的货物比去年同期增加27％，创造了解放以来半年货运量的最高纪录。
    海上油轮今年第一次运输了玉门油矿的原油，已经把近五万吨原油从连云港运到了上海的炼油工厂。在这半年里，马鞍山、浙江漓渚和广东英德等矿区的铁矿石，由内河轮船和火车运到沿海港口以后，又源源经海上运往东北鞍山，总运量比去年全年还增加五分之一以上；上海钢铁工厂生产的钢材通过沿海航线外运的数量，也超过了去年全年的12％。
    上半年，由海上运输的农具、农药和肥田粉也增加了，单是从上海港运出的就有二万三千多吨。来自农村的粮食、棉花由海轮不断运到沿海各个工业城市，总运量比去年同期增加三万吨以上。
    上半年，在海洋上多雾的季节。海员们战胜浓雾，使轮船始终安全航行。他们还采取了提高轮船吃水线、小型货轮拖带海帆船等方法，大大提高了运输能力。
