    George Bernard Shaw – An Anatomist of Bourgeois Society
    Yang Xianyi
    The World Peace Council's call to commemorate George Bernard Shaw, a world cultural celebrity this year, marks the centenary of his birth. He stands as the most renowned playwright of modern Britain and Ireland, and one of the greatest realist writers in the West since the late nineteenth century. Throughout his creative life spanning over seventy years, he penned nearly fifty plays, hundreds of essays, and dozens of other works.

    Born in Dublin, Ireland, a century ago today, Shaw came from a middle-class family; his father was a retired civil servant. Although the family's financial situation wasn't ideal during his childhood, the bourgeois nature of this family deeply influenced his thinking. It significantly impacted his intellectual development later in life, leading him through a winding path in his pursuit of truth. His mother was a music teacher, which fostered his love for music from a young age. He didn't receive much formal education. At fifteen, he worked as a clerk in a real estate company in Dublin, and later at the Edison Telephone Company. These jobs exposed him to a wide range of life experiences, laying the groundwork for his future writing. He left Ireland for London in 1876. From that time on, he began writing novels, completing five, but none garnered much attention. This was a period of exploration for the young Shaw on his life's journey.

    In the 1880s, due to the deepening crisis of British capitalism, although a truly organized large-scale workers' movement had yet to emerge, socialist ideas began to circulate among bourgeois intellectuals. It was during this period that Shaw began to receive political education. In 1882, he attended a lecture by Henry George, which made him realize the importance of the economic foundation. Shortly after, he read "Das Kapital," which was the most decisive event in his life. He himself said, "From that time on, I became someone who could achieve something in the world." Although "Das Kapital" did not make Shaw a Marxist, it determined the path he would take thereafter: a realistic creative path where art is for life and a tool for improving society. At his seventieth birthday banquet, Shaw expressed the great influence of Marx on him: "Karl Marx and socialism made me who I am; otherwise, I would not be different from many of my peers... You only need to look at other writers to understand why I feel so extraordinarily proud to be a socialist."

    In 1884, Shaw joined the newly formed Fabian Society. Although the Fabian Society at the time was entirely composed of bourgeois socialists and inevitably had an opportunistic character, many participants at the beginning still held socialist ideals and were not afraid of revolution. The young Shaw fervently hoped for the early arrival of the revolution and tirelessly engaged in propagating socialism, writing many articles. During the same period, he wrote many reviews on music and drama. In these articles, his assertion that art should be used to improve society and his tendency to develop in the direction of drama gradually became clear. From 1885 to 1898, he worked as a journalist for more than ten years. In addition to writing music and art reviews for "The World," "The Saturday Review," and "The Star," he also used this opportunity to further understand the various classes of British society. The more he mixed in bourgeois society, the more he detested the hypocrisy and ugliness of that society. In 1885, he began writing his first play, "Widowers' Houses," which bluntly exposed the corruption of capitalist society.

    British drama experienced a long period of neglect and decline after the Elizabethan era. The frivolous comedies and philistine legendary plays that prevailed in the late nineteenth century turned drama into the idle entertainment of a few leisured classes. Shaw, as a student of Ibsen and a rebel against the rise of bourgeois society in the nineteenth century, launched a fierce attack on this tradition from the beginning. He ruthlessly tore off the masks of gentlemen and sharply satirized bourgeois society. "Widowers' Houses" tells the story of a young idealist who discovers that all his income comes from the rent of slums. In this play, he compares the bourgeoisie to flies that feed on excrement and fatten themselves on the garbage heap. In the preface, he points out that writing this play was to encourage people to vote for progressive candidates in the next London municipal election. Therefore, his purpose of using drama as a tool for propagating socialism is very clear.

    In "Mrs. Warren's Profession," written in 1893, he more boldly exposed the licentiousness and shamelessness of people under the shackles of capitalism. Here, a young lady who considers herself noble and extraordinary suddenly discovers that her mother maintains her by running a brothel. Mrs. Warren reproaches her daughter: "You think you are a free woman. Have you ever asked yourself where your life comes from?" Shaw thus ruthlessly exposed the "nobility" of gentlemen and ladies. In "Major Barbara" (1905), capitalism reduces the mutual relations of people to a simple monetary relationship. All of these clearly show Shaw's disgust for the society in which he lived. He dissected the corpse of capitalist society like an unemotional doctor.

    Such works naturally angered the bourgeois authorities. "Mrs. Warren's Profession" was banned for thirty years after it was written. In 1902, a theater in New York staged it once, and after the actors finished their curtain call, they were all arrested by the police. In 1924, when the London prosecutor finally lifted the ban, Shaw issued a statement filled with satire. He lamented: "When I wrote this play, I was still an impulsive young man. Now I have reached the respectable age of sixty-eight." He indicated that it would be better never to perform it than to perform it so late, but at the same time he said that this play, after thirty years, is still equally true and equally needed.

    During the First World War, Shaw published many statements against the imperialist war, pointing out the essence of this war. This subjected him to many attacks, and his statements were also maliciously distorted. After the war, Shaw's dramatic creation entered a new stage. The problems his plays addressed were no longer individual social phenomena, but the entire society, the complete bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy, and the destruction of capitalist culture. In this regard, the first important play was "Heartbreak House," published in 1919. "Heartbreak House" is a symbol of the entire bourgeois society. Underneath "Heartbreak House" lies gunpowder, and finally, the gunpowder explodes during the air raid at the end of the play, destroying the capitalists and thieves. This play was so sharply critical of the reactionary ruling class that no one was willing to perform it for a long time after it was written. "Saint Joan" in 1923 is a historical play. Joan's loneliness and lack of understanding by the secular world reflect Shaw's bewilderment and distress. Joan says to the nobles who betrayed her: "Now I want to go among the common people and let the love in their eyes heal the wounds inflicted on me by your hatred." In these political fantasy plays, the most realistic themes and the most bizarre imaginations are intertwined. In "The Apple Cart," Macdonald appeared, in "On the Rocks," unemployed workers wanted to overthrow the government, and in "Geneva," fascists Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco were tried in The Hague. This kind of satirical play using real political themes has never been seen since the ancient Athenian comedy writers. Gorky's description of Shaw as "one of the most daring thinkers in Europe" is quite right.

    In 1931, Shaw visited the Soviet Union and later visited China. After he returned to England, he published many articles and statements, pointing out that the Soviet Union was the hope of all mankind and a beacon indicating the path to the future. In the early days of the Second World War, regardless of the rumors and sabotage by reactionary elements, he continued to praise the Soviet Union. In the two years before his death, he publicly opposed the Korean War and opposed the use of atomic bombs. In August 1950, he said in an interview with reporters: "The anti-communist war is stupid and completely nonsense... The future will belong to the country that builds communism the fastest and most thoroughly."

    In China, since the May Fourth Movement, the works of Shaw and Ibsen have received widespread attention. "Mrs. Warren's Profession" was staged in Shanghai as early as 1921, and many of his famous plays have long been translated into Chinese. They not only had an indelible influence on China's spoken drama movement but also played a role in promoting social reform. In 1933, when he came to China for a visit, the progressive literary and art circles in China, led by Mr. Lu Xun, expressed a warm welcome to him, while the imperialists and their employed writers expressed deep hatred for his visit to China. Before parting, the great playwright placed ardent hopes on the national liberation movement and the emerging culture of China at that time.

    Shaw has always been a loyal friend of people all over the world who love peace and progress. His literary achievements are extraordinarily brilliant, and his works will forever be a great force driving the world forward. (Attached picture)

    萧伯纳——资产阶级社会的解剖家
    杨宪益
    世界和平理事会号召在今年纪念的世界文化名人萧伯纳，是现代英国和爱尔兰最著名的戏剧家，也是十九世纪末年以来，西方最伟大的现实主义作家之一，今天是他诞生一百周年纪念。在他七十多年的创作生活里，他曾经写了将近五十部戏剧，几百篇论文和几十本其他著作。
    一百年前的今天，萧伯纳出生在爱尔兰的都柏林城的一个中产阶级家庭，父亲是一个退休的公务员；虽然在他幼年时期，家庭的经济情况并不太好，但这一家庭的资产阶级性质在他思想上是打了深深的烙印的，对他后日的思想发展起了很大的影响，使他在追求真理中经历了曲折的道路。他母亲是一个音乐教师，这帮助他从小就养成对音乐的爱好。他并没有在学校里受多少教育，十五岁起就在都柏林一家地产公司做小职员，以后一度又在爱迪生电话公司任职，这些工作都使他对生活有了广泛的接触，为他日后的写作打下了基础。1876年离开爱尔兰到了伦敦；从这时起，开始写小说，一共写过五篇长篇小说，但都没有引起很多注意。这是青年的萧伯纳在人生的旅途上开始摸索的时期。
    在十九世纪的八十年代，由于英国资本主义危机的加深，虽然真正有组织的大规模工人运动还未产生，但社会主义思想已经开始在资产阶级知识分子中间流行；就在这个时期里，萧伯纳开始得到了政治教育。在1882年，他听了亨利乔治的一次讲演，使他认识到经济基础的重要性。此后不久他读了“资本论”，这在他一生中是最有决定性的事件。他自己说过，“从那时候起，我才成为在世界上有所为的人”；虽然“资本论”并没有使萧伯纳成为马克思主义者，但却决定了他此后所走的道路，艺术是为了人生，是改进社会的工具的现实主义创作道路。在他七十岁生日的宴会上，萧伯纳曾这样表示马克思对他的巨大影响：“卡尔·马克思和社会主义使我变成了这样的人，不然，我和我的许多同道不会两样…………你们只要看看其他的文人，就可以明白我为什么这样异乎寻常的感到作为社会主义者的骄傲。”
    1884年，萧伯纳加入了新成立不久的费边社。当时的费边社虽完全由资产阶级社会主义者组成，它本身不可避免地带有机会主义色彩，但在开始的时候许多参加者还是有着社会主义理想的，也还并不是害怕革命的，青年的萧伯纳热烈地希望革命的早日到来，曾经不辞劳苦地从事宣传社会主义的工作，写了不少文章。同一时期他写了不少有关音乐和戏剧的评论，在这些文章里他对艺术应该是为了改进社会的主张和他向戏剧方面发展的趋向渐渐明确了。从1885到1898年，他做了十多年的记者，除了替“世界报”、“星期六评论报”和“明星报”写音乐绘画评论以外，还借此进一步了解英国社会的各阶层，他越在资产阶级社会里混，越厌恶那个社会的虚伪丑恶。1885年他开始写第一个戏剧“鳏夫之家”，就痛快淋漓地暴露了资本主义社会的腐朽。
    英国戏剧在伊利沙白时代以后经历了长期的冷落和萧条，十九世纪末盛行的轻浮喜剧和市侩的传奇剧使戏剧成为少数有闲阶级的无聊娱乐。萧伯纳作为易卜生的学生，十九世纪资产阶级社会崛起的叛徒，一开始就对这种传统进行了猛烈的攻击。他无情地撕破了绅士们的假面，尖锐的讽刺了资产阶级社会。“鳏夫之家”里写到一个年轻的理想家，发现他全部收入都是从贫民窟的房租得来的。在这个剧本里他把资产阶级比作垃圾堆上食粪而自肥的苍蝇；在序言里他指出写这剧本是要使人在下一届伦敦市选举中投进步方面的票；所以他用戏剧作为宣传社会主义的工具的目的是很明显的。
    在1893年写成的“华伦夫人的职业”里，他更加大胆地暴露了在资本主义桎梏下，人们的荒淫无耻。这里，一个自以为高贵非凡的年轻小姐，突然发现她母亲是靠着开窑子来维持她的。华伦夫人责备女儿说：“你以为你是个自由的女人，你可曾追问一下你的生活的来源？”萧伯纳就这样毫不留情地揭穿绅士淑女们的“高贵”。在“巴巴拉少校”（1905）一剧里，资本主义使人们的相互关系沦为一种单纯的金钱关系。这些都清楚地表现出萧伯纳对他生活的那个社会的厌恶。他像个不动感情的医生那样解剖着资本主义社会的这具尸体。
    这样的作品当然触怒了资产阶级当局。“华伦夫人的职业”写成后，一直禁演了三十年。1902年纽约一家剧院曾上演过一次，演员谢完幕，就全部被警察逮捕去了。1924年当伦敦检察官终于解除了禁令的时候，萧伯纳发表了一个充满了讽刺的声明。他慨叹说：“写这个戏的时候我还是个冒失的小伙子。如今我已经到了六十八岁可敬的年龄。”他一面表示迟迟演出还不如永不演出，但同时又说，这个戏在三十年后，是同样地真实，同样地需要。
    在第一次世界大战期间，萧伯纳发表了许多反对帝国主义战争的言论，指出了这次战争的本质，这使他遭受到许多攻击，他的言论也遭到恶意的歪曲。在战后萧伯纳的戏剧创作进入了一个新的阶段，他的戏剧所接触的问题已经不是个别社会现象，而是整个社会、资产阶级民主政治的全面破产和资本主义文化的毁灭了。在这方面，第一个重要剧本是“伤心之家”，于1919年发表。“伤心之家”就是整个资产阶级社会的象征，在“伤心之家”下面埋藏着火药，最后火药在剧末空袭中爆炸了，毁灭了资本家和小偷。这个剧本对反动统治阶级抨击得尖锐有力，以至写成以后，许久没人肯演出。1923年的“圣女贞德”是一个历史剧，剧中圣女的孤独和不被世俗理解，反映了萧伯纳的彷徨和苦闷，贞德对那些出卖她的贵族说：“我现在要到普通人民当中去，让他们眼睛里的爱来医治你们的仇恨加给我的创伤”。在这些政治幻想剧里，最现实的题材和最离奇的想像揉合在一起，
  “苹果车”里出现了麦克唐纳，“搁浅”里失业工人要推翻政府，“日内瓦”里法西斯分子莫索里尼，希特勒和佛朗哥在海牙法庭受审。这种利用现实政治题材的讽刺剧在古代雅典喜剧作家以后从来就没有过。高尔基称萧伯纳为
  “欧洲最大胆的思想家之一”是说得不错的。
    在1931年萧伯纳访问了苏联，此后又到过中国，在他回到英国以后，他曾发表了不少文章和言论，指出苏联是全人类的希望，是指示未来道路的灯塔。在第二次世界大战初期，他不顾反动分子的造谣破坏，继续赞扬苏联。在他临死前两年间，他公开反对朝鲜战争，反对使用原子弹。在1950年8月，他在对记者的谈话里说：“反共战争是愚蠢的，完全是胡闹……未来将属于那个将共产主义建设得最快最彻底的国家。”
    在中国，自从五四以来，萧伯纳和易卜生的作品一直受到广泛的注意，1921年上海就已上演了“华伦夫人的职业”，他的许多著名戏剧也早就译成中文。它们不但对中国的话剧运动有过不可磨灭的影响，对社会的改革也起过推动的作用。1933年，当他来中国访问的时候，当时以鲁迅先生为首的中国进步文艺界对他表示了热烈的欢迎，而帝国主义者及其御用文人对他的访华却表示了深恶痛绝。临别的时候，这位伟大的戏剧家对于当时中国的民族解放运动和中国的新兴文化，都寄托了热切的期望。
    萧伯纳始终是全世界爱好和平和进步的人们的忠实朋友。他在文学上的成就是异常辉煌的，他的作品将永远为推动世界前进的一股巨大力量。（附图片）
