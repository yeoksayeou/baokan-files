    One-Tenth of the Philippine Population Unemployed
    Out of the 21 million people in the Philippines, 2 million are unemployed; that is to say, nearly one-tenth are jobless. The Associated Press recently reported that many people in the Philippines are so poor that they don't have money to eat three meals a day, let alone send their children to school.
    Strange Charges
    On the eve of the "local elections" in South Korea, the Syngman Rhee group again beat and arrested a large number of prospective opposition candidates. According to the Associated Press, thirty-six people were arrested in Busan alone. The charges against them were very strange: some were arrested for "violating curfew regulations," some for "failing to report temporary residence to the authorities," and still others for "domestic uncleanliness"...
    Excellent Marksmanship
    According to a report on the front page of the "New York Times" on July 5, in the local government elections in Stilwell, Oklahoma, Deputy Police Chief Bob was nominated as a candidate for the next police chief. The defeated incumbent police chief, Cridendon, was unwilling, so a duel occurred. These two are worthy of being petty local police chiefs in the United States; their marksmanship was excellent. One hit the other in the forehead, and the other was shot in the heart, resulting in both of them dying.

    菲律宾十分之一人口失业
    菲律宾二千一百万人中，有二百万人没有工作做；这就是说，失业的差不多占十分之一。合众社最近报道说，菲律宾人中有许多人非常贫穷，他们没有钱吃饱三顿饭，更不用说送子女上学了。
    奇怪的罪名
    在南朝鲜举行“地方选举”的前夕，李承晚集团又殴打和逮捕了大批未来的反对派候选人。据合众社说，仅仅在釜山一地被捕的就有三十六人。他们被捕的罪名是非常奇怪的：有的是因为“破坏宵禁条例”，有的是因为“没有向当局报临时户口”，还有的是因为“家庭不清洁”……。
    高明的枪法
    据七月五日美国“纽约时报”第一版消息，在俄克拉何马州的史蒂威尔城地方政府选举中，副警察局长鲍布被提名为下一任警察局长的候选人，落选的现任警察局长克力丹顿不情愿，于是发生了一场决斗。这两人不愧为美国地方警察的小头子，枪法都很高明，一个命中对方前额，另一个被击中心窝，结果双双毙命。
