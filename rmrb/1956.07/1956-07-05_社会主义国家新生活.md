    New Life in Socialist Countries
    Blind Artists
    In the land of the Soviets, all talents are freely developed, and many blind people have become outstanding artists. As early as thirty years ago, the All-Russia Association of the Blind was established in the Soviet Union. In Moscow and Leningrad, specialized musical associations were organized for blind musicians, and over the past thirty years, many talented musicians have been cultivated here. The pianist Qiujin, famous in Moscow, when people listen to him play masterpieces by Beethoven, Scriabin, and others, who would think that he is blind, unable to see the audience or his own fingers! The Zhirkovich siblings are both blind. The performances of these two young musicians have won enthusiastic praise. These blind musicians mainly rely on memory to master new works. Others play new pieces to them section by section, and then they can memorize them with extremely keen memory.
    "Blind Sculptor" (it is hard to believe this is true, but the fact is the fact) Lina cannot see anything with her eyes, but her works are displayed in the Tretyakov Gallery and are known for their delicate and profound inner thoughts. One of her masterpieces—a deeply conceived statue of the great Russian poet Pushkin—leaves an indelible impression.
    Farmers Love Art
    Two peasant women in brightly colored pleated skirts and headscarves came to the István Csók Painting Exhibition Hall in Budapest. They browsed in front of the artworks, showing particular interest in paintings depicting tranquil pastoral life. After careful appreciation, they purchased two oil paintings, "Village by the Danube" and "Moonlight," for 15,800 forints, and then left the exhibition hall with joy.
    "Hungarian farmers had no opportunity to appreciate art before liberation. But now, art is an indispensable element in the lives of workers, peasants, and millions of ordinary people. With the improvement of material life and cultural level, the Hungarian people's love and demand for beauty, and their ability to appreciate and collect artworks, are growing day by day. This can be seen from the number of artworks sold in the several art exhibitions held by the Fine Arts Association last year. In 1955, the Fine Arts Association sold 3,175 original oil paintings, more than 1,600 watercolors, more than 38,000 prints, and more than 530 sketches. Compared with the situation in the past when even cheap reproductions were unpopular, there is indeed a world of difference."
    Folk Art Village
    The village of Zalipie is a well-known folk art center throughout Poland. The residents here have a high degree of artistic talent, and they use art to beautify all aspects of life. Now even children in Poland know that in Zalipie, everything is painted: the inner and outer walls of houses, the eaves and windows, and even the pigsties, stables, and dog houses. The wood carvings, paper cuttings, cloth cuttings, drawn thread work, tapestries, lace, etc. here also have unique styles. Imaginative and clever Zalipie women can depict and create a variety of lovely and beautiful patterns and designs. They have been invited to create murals for the cabins of the transatlantic liner "Batory" and also decorated the ceilings of restaurants in the Old Town of Warsaw. Now Zalipie's folk art has been widely applied to the industrial sector. With the help and guidance of artists and technicians, the women here are producing many patterns for scarves and textiles for the textile sector.

    社会主义国家新生活
    盲人艺术家
    在苏维埃的土地上，各种才能都得到自由的发展，许多盲人也成了杰出的艺术家。早在三十多年前，苏联就成立了全俄盲人协会。在莫斯科和列宁格勒为盲人音乐家组织了专门的音乐联合会，三十年来，这里培养出不少的天才音乐家。闻名莫斯科的钢琴家秋金，当人们听他演奏贝多芬、斯科利亚宾等名人的杰作时，谁能想到他是个看不见听众也看不见自己手指的双目失明的人呢！日尔科维奇兄妹都是双目失明的人。这两个青年音乐家的表演博得人们热烈的赞许。这些盲人音乐家在掌握新的作品的时候主要是凭记忆。别人把新作品逐段弹奏给他们听，这时，他们就能以极敏锐的记忆力记下来。
    “盲目雕刻家”（这很难令人相信是真事，可是事实究竟是事实）利娜的眼睛一点东西都看不见，可是她的作品却被陈列在特列甲科夫画廊，并以精细和深刻的内在思想而称著。她的一件杰作——经过深刻构思而雕制的俄国伟大诗人普希金像，给人以不可磨灭的印象。
    农民爱好艺术
    两个穿着鲜艳的百褶裙和扎着头巾的农妇来到了布达佩斯的伊斯特凡·乔克绘画陈列馆。她们在一幅幅的美术作品前面浏览着，而对于描绘恬静的田园生活的画幅表现出特别的兴趣。经过仔细的鉴赏之后，她们以一万五千八百福林选购了其中的两幅油画：“多瑙河畔的乡村”和“月光”，然后满心喜悦地走出了这个陈列馆。
    “匈牙利的农民在解放前是没有条件欣赏艺术的。但是现在，艺术已经是工人、农民和成千成万普通人民的生活中不可缺少的因素了。随着物质生活和文化水平的提高，匈牙利人民对美的爱好和需求，对美术作品的欣赏能力和收藏量也一天比一天增长。这一点，可以从美术协会在去年举办的几次画展中所出售的美术作品的数量上看出来。在1955年，美术协会销售的各种原版作品有三千一百七十五幅油画，一千六百多幅水彩画，三万八千多幅版画，五百三十多幅素描。这和从前连廉价的复制品都无人问津的情形比较起来，的确是有“天渊之别”。
    民间艺术之村
    萨利贝村是波兰全国远近知名的一个民间艺术中心。这里的居民具有高度的艺术才能，他们用艺术美化了生活的一切方面。现在甚至波兰的孩子们都知道，在萨利贝，每一件东西上都有画：房屋的内壁和外墙上有，屋檐和门窗上有，甚至连猪圈、马厩和狗舍里都有画。这里的木雕，剪纸，剪布，挑纱，壁毯，花边等等也都有独特的风格。富有想像力的聪明的萨利贝妇女能够描绘和制作出各种令人喜爱的美丽图案和花样。她们曾经被邀请去为横渡大西洋的远航轮“巴陶瑞”号的船舱作了壁画，还为华沙古城的餐馆画饰了天花板。现在萨利贝的民间艺术已广泛地应用到了工业部门。这里的妇女们在艺术家和技师的帮助指导下，正在为纺织部门制作出许多头巾和纺织品的图案。
