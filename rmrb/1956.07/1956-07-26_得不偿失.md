    Penny Wise, Pound Foolish
    After the collectivization of fisheries, many places have a tendency to blindly add motorized sailing boats, regardless of technical conditions and economic benefits. For example, the Licheng Fishery Cooperative in Qingdao has borrowed more than 80,000 yuan from the state since 1953 to purchase three motorized sailing boats; because the fishermen's operating skills are not good, one has already been wrecked and sunk, with a net loss of more than 30,000 yuan. This has increased the burden on the fishermen greatly, and last year the fishermen's income was not enough to cover the minimum living expenses. Last year, the catch of a pair of motorized sailing boats from the Red Star Fishery Cooperative in Guangdong was only 34% more than that of a small sailboat. The average monthly income of the motorized sailboat was 712 yuan, but the cost was 3,900 yuan, which was really penny wise, pound foolish! (Jin Botao)

    得不偿失
    渔业合作化以后，很多地方有不顾技术条件和经济效益盲目增添机帆船的偏向。例如青岛立成渔业社从1953年起共向国家贷款八万多元，添购机帆船三只；因为渔民操作技术不好，已有一支触礁沉海，净亏三万多元，这增加了渔民很大的负担，去年渔民收入就不敷最低生活的支出。广东红星渔业社去年一对机帆船的捕鱼量仅比小风帆多34％，机帆船每月平均收入712元；付出的成本却需3，900元，真是得不偿失！　（靳伯韬）
