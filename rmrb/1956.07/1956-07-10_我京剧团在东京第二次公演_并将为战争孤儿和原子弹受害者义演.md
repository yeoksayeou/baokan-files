    我京剧团在东京第二次公演
    并将为战争孤儿和原子弹受害者义演
    新华社东京9日电　中国京剧代表团从八日晚上在东京“产经会馆”剧场开始举行第二次公演。京剧团在六月初结束在东京的第一次公演后，曾经到福冈、神户、京都、名古屋、大阪等地公演。他们在七日从箱根回到东京。
    这次在东京公演的五场戏的戏票，早在六月二十五日各售票站开始售票后的半个钟头内就被抢购一空。有许多人从远道赶来看戏。上万名买到票的观众因为得到欣赏京剧的机会而兴高采烈。
    中国京剧团将在十日在“歌舞伎座”举行闭幕演出后结束在日本的全部公演。此外，应日本各界的热烈要求和为了救济日本战争中的孤儿和原子弹受害者，中国京剧团已经同“朝日新闻”社商定，十二日将在“国际剧场”举行两场义演。为了照顾一般观众，义演戏的票价将减低。在义演时，梅兰芳特地打破惯例，将日夜登台演出。
    这两场义演的戏票，已经在九日早晨不到半个钟头内被全部买去。
