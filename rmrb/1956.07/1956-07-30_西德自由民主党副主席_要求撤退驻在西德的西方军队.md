Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 29th: Bonn dispatch: The Vice-Chairman of the West German Free Democratic Party, Mundt, demanded the withdrawal of Western countries' troops stationed in West Germany at a press conference on July 27th.

	Mundt sharply criticized the West German government's attempt to prevent other countries from reducing armaments. He pointed out that while others are supporting disarmament, West Germany's independent implementation of a policy of rearmament is "going against the tide." He accused the West German government of pursuing a fruitless foreign policy, a policy that only shows the world that the West German government opposes the relaxation of the international situation.

    西德自由民主党副主席  
    要求撤退驻在西德的西方军队
    据新华社柏林29日电　波恩消息：西德自由民主党副主席蒙德七月二十七日在记者招待会上要求撤退西方国家驻在西德的军队。
    蒙德尖锐地批评了西德政府想阻止其他国家裁减军备的企图。他指出，当别人都在支持裁减军备的时候，西德独自执行重新武装的政策是“违逆潮流”。他指责西德政府执行一种毫无结果的外交政策，这种政策只是向世界表明西德政府反对国际局势的缓和。
