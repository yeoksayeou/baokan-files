	Whenever you go to the office of the township cadres in Donghenan Township, Lingqiu County, Shanxi Province, you will see people often come to Liu Changliang, the leader of the county committee's work team, asking him for relief, loans, grain supplies, free medical certificates, etc. Some people may find it strange. Isn't it the responsibility of the township people's committee to handle grain supply, relief distribution, and loans? Is it that the township cadres are derelict in their duties, forcing the masses to seek help from Liu? No, it is Liu who is too enthusiastic and has taken over all the work that should be done by the township cadres. Liu's concern for the lives of the masses is certainly commendable, but is it not worthy of criticism to not rely on and work through the local Party and government organs, taking on all matters, large and small, forming a situation where "the work team uses its mouth, and the township cadres run errands"?

    别光让乡干部跑腿
    一走到山西省灵丘县东河南乡乡干部办公的地方，就会看见经常有群众来找县委工作组的刘长亮组长，向刘组长要救济，要贷款，要供应粮食，要免费医疗证等等。也许有人会觉得奇怪，粮食供应、发救济粮款、贷款等工作不是乡人民委员会应该做的事吗？是不是乡干部有失职守因而群众不得不找刘组长帮助解决呢？不，是刘组长过于热心，把一切应由乡干部去做的工作都包办起来了。刘组长关心群众生活的精神固然可嘉，但是不依靠和通过当地党政机关去进行工作，把一切大小事情都包揽起来，形成“工作组支嘴，乡干部跑腿”，这不应该受到批评吗？
