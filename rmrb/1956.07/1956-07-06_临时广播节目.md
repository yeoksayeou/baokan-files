    "Temporary Broadcast Program"
     Yao Yu
    "Students, attention! Broadcasting now begins." The students in the classroom gradually quieted down.
    "Today's current affairs broadcast is suspended, and an important temporary notice will be broadcast instead."
    The classroom was very quiet. The students were probably thinking that something remarkable must have happened, otherwise, the time for the current affairs report would not have been taken up.
    "Students: Today, we received a notice from the District People's Committee stating that they will come to our school to inspect hygiene this afternoon after school. The notice says that it is not necessary to inform the students, and that things should be as they usually are. However, after careful consideration, we feel it is better to inform the students, so that you can be fully prepared."
    There was a rustling sound of whispering in the classroom.
    "As you all know, the hygiene campaign is a regular task. We feel that although there is no need for a crash effort, it is still necessary to temporarily organize some manpower. All classes, except for students who are absent due to illness or leave, will participate in the general cleaning this afternoon. Each class's head teacher will be responsible for supervision."
    There was laughter in the classroom.
    "The notice states: The key areas for inspection are the kitchen, dining hall, and dormitory. In accordance with this spirit, we have appropriately allocated manpower. We suggest that students cleaning the classrooms should proceed as usual. The remaining manpower in each class should be concentrated in these few areas."
    There was more laughter in the classroom.
    "Regarding matters in the kitchen, we have already notified the maintenance workers and the staff of the General Affairs Office to take responsibility for cleaning up. The dining hall and dormitory will be the responsibility of the students. Some of the tables in the dining hall have too much greasy dirt, reflecting people's images. The school has specially purchased some alkali. Students can use hot water to soak the tables and scrub them thoroughly. It doesn't matter if you use a little more boiling water. If the quilts and mattresses in the dormitory are a little dirty, they can be turned over and folded neatly, and covered with the cleanest sheet you can find. If you don't have a clean sheet, you can borrow one. Students should demonstrate a high degree of mutual assistance and friendship. Unnecessary items, especially messy things, should be placed in boxes. Remember, be sure to lock them! Broken shoes, unwashed clothes, and socks under the bed can be sent to the storage room for safekeeping during lunchtime, but they will not be returned this afternoon. There are also several special regulations: This afternoon, clothes and bedding are not allowed to be hung on the drying rack; after the spittoons have been cleaned, do not spit or blow your nose into them again; after the wastepaper baskets have been emptied, do not throw wastepaper into them again..."
    Almost all the students in the classroom burst out laughing.
    "Students! Finally, I want to say a few words. The order during today's broadcast was not very good. Many people laughed. What is there to laugh about? You must know that..."
    The classroom erupted in a burst of laughter, drowning out the rest of the broadcast.

    “临时广播节目”
     姚玉
    “同学们注意啦！现在开始广播。”教室里的同学逐渐安静下来。
    “今天，时事广播暂停，改播一件重要的临时通知。”
    教室里很肃静。同学们也许在想，一定发生了什么了不起的事情，要不然，不会占用时事报告的时间。
    “同学们：我们今天接到了区人民委员会发来的一件通知，他们要在今天下午放学以后，来我们学校检查卫生。通知上说，不必告诉同学们，平常什么样，还是什么样好了。可是我们经过慎重的研究，觉得还是告诉同学们好，这样做，同学们可以有充分的思想准备。”
    教室里开始有了切切嚓嚓的耳语声。
    “大家都知道，卫生运动是一种经常性的工作，我们觉得虽然用不着突击，但是临时组织一下人手还是有必要的。各班除了因事因病请假的同学以外，一律参加下午的大清扫，各班班主任负责督导。”
    教室里有了笑声。
    “通知上说：重点检查厨房、饭厅、宿舍，我们本着这种精神，适当地分配了一下人力。我们建议，整理教室的同学，还和平常一样。各班剩下的人力，应该全部集中到这几个地方。”
    教室里的笑声更多了。
    “厨房里面的事，我们已经通知工务员和总务处的职员，要他们负责整理。饭厅和宿舍由同学们负责。饭厅里的桌子，有的油泥太多，都照见了人影，学校特意买了一些碱，同学们可以用热水泡一下，好好把桌子刷洗一次，多用一点开水没有关系。宿舍里的被子、褥子，如果有一点脏的话，可以翻过来叠整齐，找一条最干净的单子蒙上。实在没有干净的床单，可以借一借，同学们应该发挥高度的互助友爱精神。用不着的东西，特别是乱七八糟的东西，要放在箱子里，千万记住，一定要锁上！床底下的破鞋，没洗的衣服、袜子，可以利用中午的时间，送到储藏室保管，但是今天下午不许再领。还有几项特殊规定：今天下午，晒衣架上，不许再晒衣服被褥；已经刷好的痰盂，不许再往里吐痰擤鼻涕；倒干净的字纸篓，不许再往里面丢字纸……”
    教室里的同学几乎都笑起来了。
    “同学们！最后还要说几句，今天大家听广播的秩序可不大好，有很多人笑起来，这有什么可笑的呢？要知道，……”
    教室里爆发了一片哄堂大笑声，把下面的广播掩盖住了。
