"Creditor" and "Debtor"
Mu Lin

The Oriental Red Vegetable Production Cooperative outside Guang'anmen in Beijing has had a bumper harvest of all kinds of vegetables. This large cooperative with more than two thousand households has an income of tens of thousands of yuan every day.

This scene of abundance, however, does not alleviate the worries in the hearts of some members. Although the cooperative's income is high, the amount distributed to the members is not. Since the beginning of spring, the cooperative has only made two advance distributions, with each labor day receiving only 80 cents each time. Some members said, "A sheep's tail can't cover its backside, what problems can this little bit of money solve!" Some members have even found themselves in difficult living situations as a result.

Is it that the cooperative doesn't have money? No, it doesn't. As of June, the cooperative had more than 115,000 yuan deposited in the credit cooperative, in order to earn interest. What to do about the members' difficult lives? The cooperative cadres said, "Go to the credit cooperative to borrow money!" In the past six months, the credit cooperative has provided more than 149,000 yuan in living loans to the members of this vegetable production cooperative. In this way, the members of the vegetable production cooperative have to pay interest on their labor income. A strange phenomenon has emerged: members are both "creditors" and "debtors."

It is true that the vegetable production cooperative also received interest from the credit cooperative. By flipping through the account books, the cooperative cadres can say with satisfaction: Look how much our total income has increased! But, listen to the voices of the members: "The cooperative is good in every way, but it's too inflexible with money. Borrowing a little money requires 'finding the mountain god and begging the land god.' Approval from the production cooperative isn't enough, it has to be scrutinized from head to toe at the credit cooperative, and in the end, you still have to pay interest!"

The members' calls have forced the leaders of the cooperative to pay attention to this issue; now, the cooperative has adopted a monthly advance distribution method. However, the members cannot help but demand an answer: "Who gets the interest we paid?"

### “债主”兼“债户”

    “债主”兼“债户” 
    木林
    北京市广安门外东方红蔬菜生产合作社的各种菜蔬都丰收了。这个两千多户的大社，每天都有成千上万元的收入。
    这种丰收的景象，却解除不了一些社员心中的烦恼。因为合作社的收入虽然多，可是分给社员的并不多。入春以来，这个社只预分过两次，每个劳动日每次才预分到八角钱。有的社员说：“羊尾巴遮不住羊屁股，这点钱能解决啥问题！”有些社员还因而弄得生活很困难。
    是不是社里没有钱呢？不是的。就在六月份，社里还有十一万五千多元存在信用合作社里，为的是生利息。社员生活困难，怎么办？社干部说：“到信用合作社去借钱吧！”半年来，信用合作社共贷给这个蔬菜生产合作社的社员十四万九千多元生活贷款。这样，蔬菜生产合作社的社员就不得不给自己劳动所得的收入背利息。奇异的现象出现了：社员既是“债主”，又是“债户”。
    不错，蔬菜生产合作社也从信用社得到了利息。把账本翻一翻，社干部们可以心满意足地说：看我们的总收入又增加了多少！可是，听听社员们的声音吧：“合作社什么都好，就是用钱太死。借点钱要‘找了山神求土地，’生产合作社里批准了不算，还得到信用合作社从头审到脚，最后还得背利息！”
    社员们的呼声使社里的领导人员不得不注意这个问题；现在，这个社已经采取了按月预分的办法。可是，社员不能不要求回答：“我们付了的利息算谁的？”
