    In Front of Tiananmen
    Shen Congwen

    In recent years, due to my work, I have had to pass through Tiananmen Square several times every morning and evening, regardless of the weather. But when I try to write about Tiananmen, I don't know where to begin.

    Thirty years ago, tourists who came to Beijing often had the opportunity to see strings of camel caravans advancing leisurely on the dusty roads in the suburbs. Each camel carried two large bags of grain or coal. At the end, there was usually a small camel bringing up the rear, with a large cylindrical iron bell hanging under its neck, ringing as it walked. These bells were mostly passed down through generations and had experienced many years of wind and frost, and some of their sounds were already hoarse. If you were lucky, you could also see a camel sedan chair made up of two camels, arranged diagonally one in front of the other, carrying a large wooden sedan cage, walking shakily. It might have just arrived from Mongolia or Rehe after a long journey and stopped in front of a shop outside the city. A signboard with the words "Certain-Something Escort Agency" hung in front of the shop's eaves. It turned out that the escorts mentioned in "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "Little Five Gallants" still had people inheriting their business, and there were still customers coming to ask for their services. At that time, this ancient city still retained many specimens of this kind of old society. Some belonged to two hundred years ago, and some belonged to seven or eight hundred years ago. The camel caravan was originally a fleet in the desert, and its presence in front of Tiananmen Square in the city center made the city even more ancient. At that time, Beijing's trams had not been running for long, and if a camel caravan crossed the road, the tram driver had to stop temporarily according to the rules, as if everyone had to acknowledge that these were members of Beijing since it became the capital eight hundred years ago and should show them a little courtesy or respect.

    In front of Tiananmen, there were also young students, workers, and citizens, gathering before holding demonstrations. "May Fourth," "March 18th," "May 30th," "September 18th"... In addition to these large gatherings that were reported in the newspapers, there were also frequent small-scale gatherings, each with only two or three thousand people, or seven or eight hundred people, which made the old warlords and bureaucrats feel headachey, annoyed, and difficult to deal with. Therefore, for a time, Tiananmen Square was planted with white lilacs and yellow roses everywhere. Those who didn't know thought that the warlords and bureaucrats were beautifying the old capital, but in fact, it was originally intended to reduce the area of the square and passively prevent patriotic youth from demonstrating.

    Over the past thirty years, Beijing has experienced many major events and has finally been liberated. Tiananmen has become a symbol of the people's striving for lasting peace and a symbol of working together towards a happy and better life. Every festival, hundreds of thousands of people gathering and marching has become commonplace. Times have changed, and camel caravans are no longer easily seen here. Now, anyone who wants to see this majestic, dignified, strong, and hardworking creature must go to the Nankou-Juyongguan area to have a chance to come across it. As for the children living in Beijing, in the future, they will only be able to go to the zoo or the local history museum to have the hope of knowing what a real camel looks like and understanding the various situations of camel caravans coming to Beijing from outside the Great Wall. The Beijing Zoo does not yet have a place for camels. I suggest adding two or three and appropriately explaining that their ancestors regularly carried various important materials two thousand years ago, traversed the vast Northwest desert, made great contributions to communicating the relations between the Central Plains and the Western Regions, and in the history of cultural exchange between China and the West, and the important role they played in general transportation in North China for two thousand years. It would be even better if the local history museum's display of urban-rural relations in the future could make a clear contrast between the scene of strings of camels passing through Tiananmen Square in the twilight thirty years ago and the scene of hundreds of thousands of people watching colorful fireworks soaring into the sky and singing and dancing wildly here after liberation, showing how different the two eras and two societies are.

    The era of strings of camels taking large strides across the road in front of Tiananmen, which was both antique and decadent, has completely ended. Various new things representing today and symbolizing tomorrow are constantly emerging. In front of the Tiananmen Great White Stone Bridge and stone lions, we can often find groups of children aged four or five, with red cheeks, holding hands in pairs, queuing up to go to the park. Following the instructions of the aunt, they all temporarily stop to admire the tall Tiananmen Gate in front of them, admiring the place where Chairman Mao stood six years ago to announce to the Chinese people and the world that "the Chinese people have stood up." Behind this solemn and magnificent gate tower is a clear blue sky, and a flock of white pigeons, like silver stars, circling and flying around the gate tower under this blue sky. Looking back to the south, the scaffolding of the Monument to the People's Heroes has been removed, and the entire project will be completed soon. To make this monument more solemn and beautiful, expand the surrounding open space, and new blueprints for the construction complex to be built are probably already being prepared.

    The bloodshed and sacrifice of the previous generation have paved an infinitely broad and smooth road for this generation to study and work, and the hard work of this generation is creating a happier and better environment for the younger generation. All the Chinese people—old, middle-aged, young, and children—are living in such a new society. After the completion of the revolutionary monument, various musical groups will often come to the stone platform in front of the monument in the summer evenings to hold public concerts for the citizens. Here, we can not only hear enthusiastic and beautiful folk music, but also hope to hear the healthiest and most pleasant music of great composers from all over the world. By the time the three five-year plans are completed, the square in front of Tiananmen may have completely changed its appearance. All the stands will be made of white marble, neatly arranged, the area around the monument will be extremely wide, and most of the new building complexes around it, six or seven stories high, will also be decorated with white marble, making them very beautiful. Here is the Museum of the Revolution, there is the National Museum of Natural Resources, the third is the National Cultural Museum, the fourth is the Industrial Construction Museum, the fifth is... In the evening, these large buildings are as bright as day, with thousands of tourists coming in and out. In front of the monument, there is a giant new-style silver screen twenty feet wide, using television methods to broadcast the musical dance programs being performed by the National Opera and Dance Theater, free for thirty thousand citizens to enjoy. You will also see strings of camels slowly passing in front of Tiananmen, and the bell under the neck of the small camel bringing up the rear is still ringing, attracting most people to the old landscape painting of Beijing half a century ago. It turns out that the History Museum is using television education to review the various histories in front of Tiananmen!

### 天安门前

    天安门前
    沈从文
    近几年来，我因工作关系，无论风晴雨雪，每天早晨、晚间都得进出天安门几次。可是试想拿起笔来写写天安门，倒不知从何说起了。
    三十年前到北京来观光的人，在城郊各处都常有机会看见成串的骆驼队伍，从容不迫地在灰尘扑扑的道路上前进。每只骆驼背上必驮载两大袋杂粮或煤块。末尾照例还有只小骆驼押队，颈脖下悬个筒子形大铁铃，走动时噹噹地响。这些铃铛大致是世代相传，经历了许多年月风霜，声音有些已经哑沙沙的了。若机会凑巧，还可看到一种用两只骆驼组成的驼轿，一前一后斜斜地排着，抬着个大木轿笼，摇摇晃晃地走着，它也许正从蒙古、热河长途远道前来，恰好停顿在城外一个店铺前边。那店铺门口屋檐前挂有一块“某某镖局”的招牌。原来七侠五义、小五义中提起的镖客，还有人在继承事业，又还有主顾上门求教。这个古老城市里，当时就还留下许多这类古老社会的标本。有的属于两百年前的，有的属于七八百年前的。骆驼队本来是沙漠中的舰队，在市中心的天安门前发现时，就更加显得这个城市的古老。当时北京电车开行还不多久，若遇骆驼队伍横贯马路时，电车司机照规矩还得暂时停车，等待一会儿，像是人人都得承认这是八百年前北京建都以来的成员，对待它们应当表示一点客气或尊重。
    在天安门前的，还有青年学生、工人、市民，在这里举行示威游行前的集会。“五四”、“三一八”、“五卅”、“九一八”……除了这些大的登报上书的集会以外，还经常有小规模的，每次虽然不过两、三千人，或七、八百人，已使得旧军阀官僚感到头疼心烦不好办。因此天安门前有一时曾经各处都种满了白丁香和黄刺玫，不知道的还以为军阀官僚在美化旧都，事实上原来只是有意把广场面积缩小，消极防止爱国青年的示威活动。
    三十年来，北京城经历过了许多重大事变，终于解放了。天安门成了人民争取持久和平的象征，共同努力走向幸福美好生活的象征。每逢节日，几十万群众集会游行已成平常事情。时代不同了，骆驼队伍再不容易在这里出现了。现在什么人想看看这种神气庄严、体魄壮伟、耐劳负重的生物，大致得到南口居庸关一带，才有机会偶然碰上。至于住在北京市的小朋友们呢，将来只有到动物园或地志博物馆去，才有希望知道真正的骆驼究竟是什么样子，并且明白成串骆驼由长城外来到北京的种种情形。北京动物园如今还没有骆驼的位置，我建议不妨加入两、三只，并且把它们祖先两千年前就经常载运了各种重要物资，横贯西北大沙漠，对于沟通中原和西域各民族关系，以及在中西文化交通史方面所作的伟大贡献，和二千年来在华北一般交通运输中所起的重要作用，加以适当的说明。更好的自然是将来地志博物馆陈列中表现城乡关系时，能够把三十年前成串骆驼在暮色沉沉时通过天安门前的景象，和解放后几十万群众在这里看五色焰火上冲霄汉、歌舞狂欢的景象，作一个显明对比，可见出两个时代，两种社会，如何截然不同。
    天安门前大路上，成串骆驼迈着大方步过路，这种古色古香的，同时也是暮气沉沉的时代，已经完全结束了。代表今天、象征明天的各种新事物，却在不断出现。天安门大白石桥、石狮子前边，我们经常都可发现一群群年纪四、五岁的小朋友，两颊红都都的，双双拉着手排队上公园去，随着阿姨的指点，一齐暂时停下来欣赏面前那个高大的天安门楼，欣赏毛主席六年前站到那上面向中国人民、向全世界宣布“中国人民站起来了”的那个地方。这个庄严壮丽的大门楼背后，正衬着一片透蓝的天空，一群白鸽子和银星点子一样，在这个蓝空天幕下绕着门楼回旋飞翔。回过头向南边望望，人民英雄纪念碑大棚架已经撤去，全部工程过不久就要完成了。要使得这个纪念碑更加庄严好看一些，扩大四周空地，更新的待施工的建筑群蓝图，应当已经在准备中。
    前一代的流血牺牲，为这一代青年学习和工作开辟了无限广阔平坦的道路，这一代的勤劳辛苦，又正在为幼小一代创造更加幸福美好的环境，全中国人民——老年、壮年、青年和儿童，就活在这么一个新的社会中。革命纪念碑全部落成后，夏天黄昏时节，会经常有各种音乐团体，来在纪念碑前边石台上；向市民举行公开演奏会，在这里我们不仅可听到热情优美的民间音乐，还有希望可听到世界各国伟大作曲家最健康悦耳的音乐。到三个五年计划完成时，天安门前的广场，可能已经完全改变了样子，所有看台都用汉白玉石作得整整齐齐，纪念碑附近已展开极宽，四周六七层高的新建筑物群，也大部分用汉白玉石装饰，作得十分华美。这里是革命博物馆，那里是祖国自然资源馆，第三是民族文化馆，第四是工业建设馆，第五是……，到晚上，这些大型建筑物里边，都光亮得和大白天一般，有万千游人进出。纪念碑前却有了二十丈大的巨型新式银幕，用电视方法，放映国家歌舞剧院正在上演的音乐舞蹈节目，免费供给三万市民群众欣赏。也还会看见成串骆驼正在慢慢地从天安门前边走过，而且押队那支小骆驼，颈脖下那个铃铛，依旧噹噹地响着，把多数人暂时都吸引到半世纪前北京旧风景画中去，原来这是历史博物馆在用电视教育回述天安门前的种种历史！
