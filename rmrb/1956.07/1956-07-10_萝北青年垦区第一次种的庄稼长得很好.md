Xinhua News Agency, Luobei, 9th. The pioneers of the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area on the banks of the Heilongjiang River have planted 3,400 hectares of crops on newly reclaimed land for the first time this year, and they are growing well. Two months ago, this was still a desolate prairie, but now soybeans, wheat, rice, and some late crops have been planted. The various vegetable seeds that the pioneers brought from their hometowns have also been sown on these newly cultivated lands. Among the various crops, soybeans are growing best, generally reaching seven or eight inches in height. The soybean seedlings have already covered the ground. When local farmers pass by this field of spring-planted soybeans, they all say that one hectare will surely yield more than one ton. Vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, spinach, eggplant, and potatoes planted on land cultivated last year are also growing very well, and now small spinach has already appeared on the plates of the farm members.

The number of young volunteer pioneers who have come to the Luobei Grassland to engage in reclamation has reached 2,287. These young people have established seven youth collective farms on the Luobei Grassland, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and "May Fourth" farms. Most of these farms are located deep in the grasslands where there are no roads. These young people use manpower to transport grain, seeds, and farm implements along transportation lines of seventy or eighty *li*. The two agricultural technology extension stations in the reclamation area helped train forty technicians to operate animal-powered farm implements. After the Luobei Tractor Reclamation Station helped plow the land, they immediately sowed the seeds day and night.

    萝北青年垦区第一次种的庄稼长得很好
    新华社萝北9日电　黑龙江畔萝北青年垦区的拓荒者，今年第一次在新垦的土地上播种的三千四百公顷作物生长良好。两个月以前这里还是一片荒芜的草原，现在，已经种植了大豆、小麦、水稻和一些晚庄稼。拓荒者从自己的家乡带来的各种蔬菜种子，也播种在这些新垦地上了。在各种作物中大豆长得最好，一般都有七、八寸高。豆苗已经遮住地面了。当地农民经过这片春开春种的大豆田时，都说一公顷准能收获一吨以上。种在去年翻耕的地块上的白菜、菠菜、茄子和马铃薯等蔬菜也长得很好，现在小菠菜已经出现在庄员们的餐桌上了。
    来到萝北草原从事垦荒的青年志愿拓荒者，已达两千二百八十七名。这些青年在萝北草原上，成立了北京、天津、河北和“五四”等七个青年集体农庄。这些农庄大多数是在没有道路通行的草原深处。这些年轻人就在七、八十里路的运输线上，用人力运输粮食、种子和农具。垦区的两处农业技术推广站，帮助训练了四十名操纵畜力农具的技术员。萝北拖拉机垦荒站帮助翻耕后，他们随即昼夜不息地播种。
