    Cultivating Academic Atmosphere, Launching Academic Debate
       Hua Luogeng
    After participating in the National Twelve-Year Science Plan, one major issue that scientific workers constantly think about is how to ensure the smooth implementation of the Twelve-Year Plan, and how to meet the Party and the people's requirements for scientists to catch up with or approach world standards within twelve years. Based on my past experience in advanced scientific countries, and based on recent conversations with scholars from various countries while attending the Third All-Soviet Mathematical Congress, I deeply feel that in order to achieve the above goals, cultivating an academic atmosphere and launching academic debates in our country is a matter of paramount importance. The speed of growth of animals and plants often depends on environmental conditions. A society with an academic atmosphere, a society that can engage in free debate, is indeed a good environment for scientific growth. Now I would like to offer some suggestions on how to cultivate an academic atmosphere.
    First, the leaders of academic institutions should personally engage in academic work as role models. Whether in socialist countries or scientifically developed capitalist countries, there is a convention that the person in charge of an academic organization or institution must give an academic report (or a keynote address) when elected to office. The report generally contains a comprehensive overview of the most outstanding contributions of their life; this kind of report generally plays an inspirational role in the development of the science. Such a report also indicates the academic leader's emphasis on scholarship, their academic attainments, and their competence for the work. On the other hand, it also encourages those who follow, setting an example in the group they lead. Abroad, comparisons of the content of past inaugural addresses are often used as a barometer of the rise and fall of the society.
    The heads of academic institutions or organizations also frequently host seminars, listen to academic research reports with creative discoveries, preside over discussions, criticisms, and commendations from the audience on these new discoveries; sometimes they comment on the value of the academic papers, and offer their own insightful views, sometimes even pointing out more in-depth insights than the original author, thereby helping young people's scientific research work. Of course, almost without exception, they themselves must engage in research work and specifically guide research work.
    Secondly, the admission and joining of members of academic organizations must be different from general social groups, and must undergo academic screening. That is to say, in addition to completing the general social group procedures, members must also submit an admission paper and give an academic report, undergo full discussion at the report meeting, and then go through the procedures of the board of directors. This is to make participants realize that their membership is a symbol of their entry into the academic field, thus creating a sense of honor. Of course, more importantly, the salary increases and promotions of the Academy of Sciences and universities should be based on academic achievements, and avoid relying on age or qualifications. It is essential to make those who are promoted feel honored and feel that they have new academic responsibilities. Before liberation, students who returned from studying abroad became professors, easily reaching the top in academic positions, without any encouragement. After becoming a professor, they stopped researching, stagnated, and wasted decades of their lives, which was not uncommon. This phenomenon should be eliminated in the future.
    More importantly, all levels of academic institutions must hold regular academic discussion meetings. In universities, teaching and research sections may be used as the basic unit (or even smaller), and in research institutes, professional research groups may be used as the basic unit. Good results can be reported and discussed at higher academic conferences. The purpose of these discussions, in addition to exchanging experiences and discussing different opinions, can also help the reporter check for shortcomings in their work. We know that mistakes often occur in the scientific field. More reports mean more guarantees, and more discussions mean more opportunities for correction, and it can also reduce the possibility of finding errors after the publication of the paper. Local branches of various societies should also hold academic discussion meetings and regularly read papers. National academic discussion meetings should also be held frequently.
      "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" must start with "small contention," first proposed in the original basic unit, listening to various different opinions, correcting discovered errors, and then proposing it to scholars more widely. This is a more secure method. The possibility of "remaining silent until you shock the world with one cry" is rare. Generally, it starts with a low hum and a small song, and then a sudden long cry.
    When holding academic discussions, it is also extremely useful to notify scholars in related academic subjects to participate in the discussion. This can not only allow everyone to gain the benefits of mutual learning from various different perspectives, not only can it broaden the horizons of scholars limited to one corner, but it can also often help develop marginal disciplines, and even create new disciplines. Of course, organizing "Scientists' Homes" or "Scientists' Clubs," etc., so that scientists from different fields can have the opportunity to meet and talk, can also produce the same effect and function.
    In addition to the above suggestions, there are many things that should be improved. For example, the administrative work of scientists must be reduced to the minimum. People must recognize the relationship between scientific administrative leaders and scientists. People often have abnormal views, thinking that the academic status of the director of the research institute is higher than that of the researcher, and the head of the department is higher than the professor; in essence, it should be "researcher concurrently serving as director" and "professor concurrently serving as head of the department." The so-called director and head of the department are just representatives of researchers and professors, responsible for handling some administratively related matters. Academic leadership must, of course, still rely on the collective leadership of experts who have made academic contributions. Of course, this does not preclude the possibility of researchers and professors with relatively high academic status leading the work, making it easier to promote the work. Staff who specialize in scientific administrative leadership must recognize the importance of their work and consider it their pleasure and responsibility to save scientists engaged in scientific research even one minute. Avoid randomly grabbing scientists to attend meetings, of course, long meetings, transactional meetings, unprepared meetings, and so on, are out of the question.
    Building modern science for the motherland is a sacred cause. The Party and the government have sown the seeds well, and it is the responsibility of our scientific workers to cultivate diligently. It is within our grasp to blossom and bear fruit as soon as possible in an environment of rich academic atmosphere. However, it is the responsibility of all of us to cultivate an even richer academic atmosphere, and more importantly, the leading comrades.
    Meet and talk less about trivialities, talk more about academics.

    培养学术空气，展开学术争论
       华罗庚
    在参加了全国科学十二年规划工作以后，科学工作者们念念不忘的一件大事，就是如何才能保证十二年规划顺利执行，怎样才能达到党和人民对科学家在十二年内赶上或者接近世界水平的要求。根据已往在科学先进国家所了解到的经验，根据最近出席全苏第三届数学大会和各国学者交谈的结果，我深深觉得为了要达到上述目的，在我国培养学术空气、展开学术争论是一个具有头等重要意义的问题。动物、植物生长的快慢常取决于环境的条件。有学术空气的社会，能够展开自由争辩的社会，确是适宜于科学生长的好环境。现在我就如何才能培养出学术气氛提供一些意见。
    首先，学术机构的领导者，应当亲自动手以身作则地从事学术工作。无论在社会主义国家和科学发达的资本主义国家都有一个惯例，就是学术团体或者学术机构的负责人在当选就职的时候，必须有一个学术报告（或者称为就职演讲），报告内容大致是他这一生中精彩贡献的一部分的综合报告；这种报告一般对该门科学的发展，将起启发性的作用。这样的报告也表示，这一学术负责人对学术的重视和他在学术上的造诣以及对这项工作的胜任；另一方面，也鼓励后来者，在他所领导的团体中起表率作用。在国外常把历届就职演讲内容的比较，来作为这学会盛衰的测候器。
    学术机构或者学术团体的负责人，也经常主持讨论会（习明纳尔），在讨论会中听取有创造性发现的学术研究报告，主持听众对这些新发现的讨论，批评和表扬；有时评论这学术论文的价值，并启发性地提出自己的看法，有时还指出比原著者更深入的看法，从而帮助青年人的科学研究工作。当然几乎无例外地他自己要从事研究工作并且具体地指导研究工作。
    其次，关于学术团体成员的吸收和加入也必须有别于一般的社会团体，必须经过学术甄别。也就是说，会员的入会除掉要办理一般社会团体的手续以外，也必须提出入会论文，并且作一次学术报告，在报告会上经过充分讨论，再经过理事会通过的手续。这为的是使参加者认识到，他的入会是他进入学术领域的标志，因而有一种光荣感，当然更重要的是科学院和高等学校的加薪晋级应当以学术成就为标准，切忌靠年龄、凭资格的办法。务必使升级的感到光荣，感到在学术上负有新责任。解放以前，留学生回来就当教授，在学术职位上轻易就达到顶点，毫无鼓励之可言。当了教授，就停止研究，故步自封，忽忽几十年的颇不乏人。这种现象今后应当消除。
    更重要的是各级学术机构都必须举行经常的学术讨论会。高等学校里可能以教研组为基本单位（或者更小些也可以），而研究所以各个专业研究小组为基本单位。成绩好的可以提到比较高的学术会议上报告和讨论。这种讨论会的目的，除掉交流经验、讨论不同意见以外，还可以帮助报告人检查工作中的缺点。我们知道在科学领域中是经常会出现错误的，多一次报告多一重保证，多一次讨论就多一次修正的机会，并且还可以减少论文刊行以后再发现错误的可能性。各学会的各地分会也应该举行学术讨论会，定期宣读论文。全国性的学术讨论会也应当经常举行。
      “百家争鸣”必须从“小鸣”开始，先在原基本单位提出，倾听各种不同的意见，纠正已经发现的错误，再更广泛地向学者们提出。这样才是一个稳妥的办法。“不鸣则已，一鸣惊人”的可能性是少有的，一般是低吟、小唱，然后是戛然长鸣。
    在开学术讨论会的时候，如果能通知有关的学术科目的学者共同参加讨论，也是极有作用的事情。这不但可以使大家从各种不同的角度获得切磋琢磨的益处，不但可使局限一隅的学者扩大眼界，并且常常有助于发展边缘性的学科，甚至创造出新学科。当然如组织“科学家之家”或者“科学家俱乐部”等，使不同领域的科学家能有见面交谈的机会，也可以产生同样的效果和作用。
    除了以上的建议以外，还有不少应当注意改进的事项。例如，必须把科学家的行政工作削减到最少限度。人们必须认清科学行政领导同科学家之间的关系。人们往往有不正常的看法，认为研究所所长学术地位高过研究员，系主任高过教授；实质上应当是“研究员兼任所长”，“教授兼任系主任”。所谓所长和系主任只不过是研究员和教授中的代表，来负责处理一些行政有关的事务而已。而学术领导当然还必须依靠学术上有贡献的专家们的集体领导。当然，这并不排斥由学术地位比较高的研究员和教授来领导工作，可以更容易推进工作的可能性。专搞科学行政领导的工作人员，更必须认清自己工作的重要性，要把能够使从事科学研究事业的科学家们省下一分钟当做是自己的愉快，当做是自己的责任。切忌乱抓科学家们开会，当然开长会，开事务性的会，开没有准备的会，等等，那就更不在话下了。
    为祖国建立现代科学是一件神圣的事业。党和政府已经很好地播种，辛苦耕耘是我们科学工作者的责任，在学术空气浓馥的环境中尽速地开花结实是可操胜算的。但是把学术空气培养得更浓馥些，却是我们大家的责任，其中更重要的是领导同志们。
    见面少叙寒暄话，多把学术谈几声。
