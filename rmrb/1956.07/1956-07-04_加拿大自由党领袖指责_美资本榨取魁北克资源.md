Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from Ottawa: During the recent election campaign in Quebec province, Liberal leader George-Émile Lapalme accused Premier Duplessis of allowing American capital to exploit Quebec's resources. Lapalme cited the example of the Canadian Iron Ore Company, largely owned by an American steel company, which extracts ten million tons of ore annually but only pays $100,000 in mining royalties. He said that this price was ridiculously low, demonstrating how American companies are exploiting the province's resources. He said that the company should have been forced to build a steel plant in Quebec instead of allowing it to transport iron ore to the United States.

    加拿大自由党领袖指责
    美资本榨取魁北克资源
    据新华社28日讯　渥太华消息：在最近魁北克省举行的竞选运动中，自由党领袖乔治—阿米勒·拉巴姆指责省长托普勒西斯允许美国资本榨取魁北克的资源。拉巴姆举例说，有很大一部分属于美国的钢铁公司所有的加拿大铁砂公司每年采一千万吨矿砂，只付出十万美元的矿山使用费。他说，这项代价低得可笑，它表明美国企业在如何榨取着这个省的富源。他说，本来应当迫使这家公司在魁北克建筑一个钢铁厂，而不让它把铁砂运到美国。
