	New Look of Sports

	The Nation's Largest Swimming Pool
	The largest swimming pool in the country, the Taoranting Swimming Pool, is under construction. This swimming pool can accommodate 6,000 people for activities and international competitions. There are six pools inside, and the water is flowing, capable of being completely replaced every twelve hours. Beside the diving pool, a ten-meter-high diving platform steel frame has already been erected. A sunbathing area larger than the total area of the swimming pools will be opened next to the pool, covered with fine sand like a beach. This swimming pool will be completed and open to the public in August this year. (Zhang)

	The Workers' Stadium Football Field is Covered with Turf
	The football field of the Workers' Stadium used to be yellow soil, but now it has been covered with a layer of green turf. Foreign football teams will no longer feel uncomfortable when playing here in the future. (Qing)

	Natural Swimming Pool on the Moat
	A natural swimming pool that can accommodate seven or eight thousand people is being built in the moat inside Xibianmen. Now, the bottom of the river has been paved with a layer of pebbles, the banks have been built with brick and stone steps, and the west bank has also become a green lawn. In the future, after the Yongding River water is introduced, swimming enthusiasts can show off their skills here. (Xing)

	Glass Backboards for Basketball Hoops in the Gymnasium
	The basketball hoop backboards in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium have been replaced with transparent glass boards. In this way, spectators sitting behind the backboards can also see any angle of wonderful shooting actions without being blocked by the backboards. (Zhang)

	"Roller Skating Rink" in Summer
	There is a "roller skating rink" on the sunbathing area next to the swimming pool in Shichahai Sports Field. Although it is already hot summer, people still often come here to practice skating movements with their hands behind their backs. These people are members of the Beijing roller skating team. They insist on exercising and strive to achieve better results in the Winter Games. (Qing)

    体育新貌
    全国最大的游泳场
    全国规模最大的游泳场——陶然亭游泳场正在兴建。这个游泳场可以容纳六千人活动和举行国际比赛。游泳场内有六个池子，池水是流动的，每隔十二小时就能全部更换一次。在跳水池边，现在已经竖立起十公尺高的跳台钢架子。池旁将要开辟一个比游泳池总面积还大的日光浴场，场上铺着像海滨一样的细沙。这个游泳场在今年八月就可以建成和开放。　（张）

    西便门里的护城河正在修建一座能容纳七、八千人的天然游泳场。现在，河底已铺上一层鹅卵石，岸边砌好砖石的台阶，西岸也变成一片绿草地。将来永定河水引进后，游泳爱好者就可以在这里大显身手了。　（邢）
    体育馆篮球架的玻璃遮板
    北京体育馆比赛馆中的篮球架遮板已经换成透明的玻璃板。这样，坐在遮板后面的观众同样可以看到任何角度的精采投篮动作，而不会被遮板挡住视线。　（张）
    夏季的“旱冰场”
    什刹海体育场游泳池旁边的日光浴场上有一个“旱冰场”，虽然现在已经是炎热的夏季，仍然有人经常到这里背着手练习溜冰动作。这些人是北京市溜冰代表队的队员，他们坚持锻炼，争取在冬季运动会上取得更好的成绩。　（青）
