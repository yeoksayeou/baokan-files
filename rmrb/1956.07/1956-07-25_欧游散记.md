	Two Roman Cities
	Rome can be said to be composed of two Romes. One is modern Rome, with multi-story buildings and bustling roads, and the other is the ruins of ancient Rome, with semi-circular columns and fragments of reliefs everywhere. Directly opposite the tomb of Emperor Augustus, a modern high-rise building is a famous hotel. People can sit on the hotel's veranda to admire the moon rising from the high walls of the tomb. And the hotel sells the most famous noodles mixed with cheese and butter. According to traditional custom, the chef brings the steaming noodles to the customer's table and mixes in the seasoning in person. When the plump old chef learned that we were Chinese, he started with the textual research on the origin of noodles from China, and kept saying "Long live China!" even as he carefully mixed the noodles.
	"Long live China!" expresses the Latin people's unique enthusiasm and frank character.
	Rome's ancient cultural relics attract hundreds of thousands of tourists from all corners of the world to visit. The Colosseum, which can accommodate 200,000 people, has four levels of seating, and the basement is where the beasts are kept. In ancient times, Christians who were called heretics were devoured here by lions and tigers in droves. After two warriors fought, the victor, holding his knife, would ask the dignitaries present how to deal with the defeated opponent. If everyone pointed their thumbs down, the loser would be killed. This cruel entertainment venue of the ancient Romans has already partially collapsed, but from the remaining part, it is indeed a great building.
	The most complete building in ancient Rome is the Arch of Constantine. It seems that the Arc de Triomphe in Paris is a replica of this building. The Temple of Venus, located in the center of ancient Rome, is gone, leaving only a few stone steps and pillar bases. And just outside the ancient Roman city, a modern building built of white marble was erected to commemorate Victor Emmanuel II. This building, decorated with huge group sculptures and an equestrian statue of the emperor, can be said to be an imitation and development of ancient Roman architecture. When this building stands side by side with these relics of ancient Rome, it appears exceptionally harmonious, making people able to revive the ancient city in their imagination based on this modern building.

    两个罗马城
    罗马城可以说是由两个罗马组成的。一个是现代的罗马，多层的建筑和熙攘的马路，另一个是古罗马城的遗址，到处是半截的圆柱和浮雕的碎片。就在奥古斯丁大帝的坟墓对面，一个现代式的高楼是著名的饭店。人们可以坐在饭店的走廊上来欣赏由墓地的高墙上升起的月亮。而饭店出卖着最著名的用乳酪、黄油拌起来的面条，按照传统的习惯，厨师要把热气腾腾的面条端到顾客的桌子上当面把作料拌进去。胖胖的老厨师知道了我们是中国人时，便从面条来自中国的考证谈起，一直到他精心地拌和面条时还不停地说着“中国万岁！”
  “中国万岁！”表现了拉丁民族特有的热情和爽朗的性格。
    罗马的古文化遗迹吸引着成千上万的游客从世界各个角落来这里游历。能够容纳二十万人的圆形斗兽场，观众席共有四层，地窟是养兽的地方。古代，被称为异端的基督教徒便成群的被狮子、老虎在这里吞噬了。两个武士搏斗后，胜利者执着刀询问在场的贵宾们，怎样处置这失败的对手，如果大家都把大姆指指向下面，失败者便要被杀死。这个古罗马人的残忍的娱乐场所已经有一半倾倒了，但从残存的一部分看来，这确是一个伟大的建筑物。
    古罗马城的最完整的建筑是康士坦丁大帝的凯旋门，看来，巴黎的凯旋门便是这个建筑的仿制品。位于古罗马城中心的威纳斯庙，则甚么都没有了，只剩下几阶石梯和几个柱脚。而就在古罗马城的外边，一座用白色大理石建成的现代建筑是为了纪念爱虞麦尔二世的，这个饰有庞大的群像雕刻和皇帝的骑马铜像的建筑，可以说是古罗马式建筑的模仿和发展，这个建筑跟这些古罗马城的遗物并列一起时显得异常谐调，使人简直能够根据这个现代建筑在想像中把这座古城复活起来。（附图片）
