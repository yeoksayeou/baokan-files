Promoting Mixed Work Teams
    Saves Over 30,000 Workdays
    (Our report) Anshan Iron and Steel's construction units have greatly improved labor efficiency since widely implementing mixed work teams.
    This mixed work team is an important advanced experience in labor organization from the Soviet construction industry. It closely organizes various types of work according to the characteristics of the project, which can reduce work stoppages caused by mutual obstruction and waiting, making more effective use of working hours.
    After Anshan Metallurgical and Chemical Construction Company promoted this form of labor organization in the first half of this year, labor efficiency increased by 32% compared with the past specialized work teams; more than 32,390 workdays were saved, and material costs were reduced by more than 7,600 yuan. When a bricklaying work team of Anshan No. 2 Mining Company worked in the form of a specialized work team, the labor efficiency was 109.7%. After switching to a mixed work team, it has increased to 155.2%.
    At present, there are 158 such work teams in Anshan Iron and Steel's construction units, with the number of participants increasing more than seven times compared with last year. The Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has issued a notice requiring further promotion of this form of labor organization in the future. (Feng Shiming)

    推行混合工作队
    节省工日三万多
    本报讯　鞍钢的建筑单位，广泛推行混合工作队以后，劳动效率有很大的提高。
    这种混合工作队是苏联建筑业在劳动组织方面的一项重要先进经验。它根据工程特点把各个工种紧密地组织起来，可以减少由于互相妨碍和彼此等待所造成的停工现象，使工时得到更有效的利用。
    鞍山冶金化学建筑公司今年上半年推广了这种劳动组织形式以后，劳动效率比过去的专业工队提高了32％；节省的工日有三万二千三百九十多个，节省材料费用七千六百多元。鞍山第二矿山公司的一个砌砖工作队，用专业工作队形式工作的时候，劳动效率是109.7％，改用混合工作队以后，已经提高到155.2％。
    目前这种工作队在鞍钢各建筑单位，已经有一百五十八个，参加的人数比去年增加七倍以上。冶金工业部建筑局已经发出通知，要求今后进一步推广这种劳动组织形式。　（冯世明）
