Who Says Advanced Cooperatives Don't Need Political Work?
    Shang Kai

    This spring, some cadres in townships and agricultural cooperatives in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, saw that agricultural cooperation had been realized, the private ownership system had been changed, and a production upsurge had arrived, so they began to doubt: "Is political and ideological work still needed in agricultural cooperatives?"

    At the county's rural socialist construction activists' conference, just as everyone was in a victorious mood, summarizing winter production and discussing spring plowing plans, Qin Hechang, the Party Branch Secretary of Hetou Township, raised a new issue in his speech. He said that since the realization of advanced cooperation in Hetou Township, a dangerous argument has been circulating among the cadres of the township and cooperatives: "With socialist cooperation, things will go well even without leadership." Saying that agricultural cooperatives are "mills that turn without being pushed, and boats that sail without being rowed," and that "political and ideological work is not needed." As a result, political and ideological work was cancelled, the reading newspaper system in the agricultural cooperative, which was held every five and ten days, was interrupted, the political classes in the people's schools were cancelled, and there was no "political comparison" in the production summary and evaluation.

    Qin Hechang's speech sounded the first alarm for the county party committee.

    County Party Secretary Fan Renqing said to Propaganda Minister Lü Genshan, who was sitting next to him, "The agricultural cooperatives in Hetou Township are advanced agricultural cooperatives, and they have always paid attention to political and ideological work in the past. Now that this situation has occurred after advanced cooperation, we should find out what's going on and see if this is a general problem." Taking advantage of the break in the meeting, Fan Renqing and Lü Genshan held separate symposiums for township branch secretaries. The information reflected in the symposiums regarding political and ideological work was not much. Fan Renqing and Lü Genshan believed that this precisely illustrated the seriousness of the problem: after advanced cooperation, no one bothered to understand and study the thoughts of the members, and no one paid attention to political and ideological work.

    The Lu'an County Committee decided to organize an investigation team, led by the Propaganda Department, to go to six representative base townships, such as Weijiazhuang and Sudian, to conduct investigations. The investigation team found that a relatively common saying among the cadres was: "The whole township is cooperative, the masses are enthusiastic, and there's nothing to do but focus on production." Wang Zhiping, the Party branch secretary of Handian Township, publicly stated: "Political work alone cannot produce grain. Doing a good job in production is political work." Therefore, he jumped into the well every day to dig wells, and did not care about the political and ideological work in the cooperative. Wang Wensheng, the branch secretary of Chili Village, was a Party propagandist. After advanced cooperation, he declared: "Propaganda work is not needed anymore." He took the lead in resigning from his position as a propagandist, and the propaganda network was dissolved invisibly. When the county committee investigation team asked them, "Why don't you do political and ideological work?", Qiao Guide, the branch secretary of Dongmiao Village, gave a wonderful answer. He said, "Production work can be cashed in, but political work is invisible." Some people even tried to replace complex and meticulous ideological work with labor management. They said: Since the private ownership of the means of production has been eliminated, production has quotas, and labor has work points, there is no need to worry about the members not being active.

    In fact, what was the situation in the agricultural cooperative? The habits and selfish and conservative psychology that many members had developed in long-term individual operations were in sharp conflict with the new relations of production. In order to grab work points, phenomena such as disregarding the quality of farm work, damaging livestock and farm tools were found everywhere. Wang Laiqing, the labor team leader of the Sudian Agricultural Cooperative, damaged twelve mu of wheat seedlings in order to grab work points, and it was estimated that the yield per mu would be reduced by more than eight or nine dou. When Xing Jingmi, a member of the Nangou Agricultural Cooperative, was sending manure to the fields, he only cared about running fast and did not give the livestock water or grass, causing the livestock to collapse and unable to get up. Even such a thing happened, Hou Fuxiang, a feeder of an agricultural cooperative in Jüzhai Township, in order to fatten the livestock and get a bonus, led the livestock to eat the wheat seedlings of the cooperative in the middle of the night.

    After studying these situations, the Lu'an County Party Committee held a county-wide political and ideological work conference.

    At this conference, more than a dozen township branches reported on their experiences and lessons in political and ideological work. Among them was "The Experience of the Jüzhai Branch in Conducting Political and Ideological Work in the Great Production Movement of Cooperation." When the members of the Jüzhai Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative were discussing the 1956 production plan, everyone expressed doubts about the Party branch's proposed plan to increase grain production by 106 jin per mu. At this time, the Party branch mobilized all the Party propagandists to repeatedly publicize the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft) and the stories of labor models Li Shunda, Wu Houli and other members building mountainous areas to the members, inspiring the members' confidence in increasing production. Then, the Party branch led the various field production teams to summarize their experiences, tap the potential for increasing production, and organize the members to accumulate fertilizer and build water conservancy projects. After the right-leaning conservative ideas inside and outside the Party were criticized, in just a few dozen days, the entire cooperative accumulated 110,000 dan of fertilizer, dug more than 100 drought wells, and built a reservoir and a small reservoir. In addition, a three-li-long, fifteen-foot-wide living water canal was also basically completed.

    In contrast to the situation of the Jüzhai Branch was the Yincheng Township Branch. Because this branch neglected political and ideological work in the agricultural cooperative, serious paralysis of thought grew from top to bottom in the whole cooperative. They actually handed over eleven good livestock in the cooperative to eleven landlord and rich peasant elements (who had changed their status) who had just joined the cooperative to be responsible for using and feeding them. The cooperative cadres believed that "landlord and rich peasant elements have experience in feeding big mules and horses." As a result, not only did these people feed the eleven livestock poorly, but they also beat a good horse to death.

    After listening to these reports, everyone exposed and criticized the phenomenon of neglecting the Party's political and ideological work in the group meetings.

    The Handian Township group carried out criticism and self-criticism seriously. Wang Zhiping, the branch secretary who only cared about digging wells and earning work points himself, did not make a deep enough self-examination. Song Genwang, the deputy secretary of the township general branch, made a sharp criticism of him: "You are the branch secretary, but you don't lead the masses; you are also a propagandist, but you don't do propaganda work. Measure yourself by the standards of a Party member and see if you are still qualified." Zhao Chengwang, the branch secretary of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative, also criticized him: "You don't care about the work of the cooperative, you only know how to bury yourself in production and earn work points, and you put personal interests above the interests of the Party. Can a Communist Party member do this?" With everyone's help, Wang Zhiping further criticized his mistakes and expressed his determination to correct them. The Handian Township group also actively came up with many specific measures to strengthen the political and ideological work of the agricultural cooperative.

    After the meeting, according to the county-wide comprehensive plan for political and ideological work in 1956 adopted by the meeting, the towns and cooperatives across the county launched a love-the-cooperative movement. The cooperatives publicized the national, county, and cooperative's long-term plans to all members, and then, by revising the production plans and calculating income, made each member realize that if the cooperative increases production, the members will be happy, and if the cooperative reduces production, the members will have difficulties. As many members themselves said, "If the cooperative loses an ear of grain, I will also lose a grain," and "Loving the cooperative is loving yourself." On the basis of improving the socialist ideology of the members, the Party organizations in the townships also mobilized the members to put forward specific action plans to love the cooperative according to their different positions based on the cooperative's seasonal production plans and current production activities.

    After a series of ideological education, the relationship between the members and the agricultural cooperative has undergone new changes, and many people have understood how to correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and collective interests. Models of loving the cooperative have emerged one after another.

    谁说高级合作社不需要政治工作
    商恺
    今年春天，山西潞安县有一部分乡和农业社的干部看到：农业合作化实现了，私有制度改变了，生产高潮到来了，因此发生了怀疑：“农业社里的政治思想工作是不是还需要呢？”
    在全县农村社会主义建设积极分子大会上，大家正怀着胜利者的心情，总结冬季生产和讨论春耕计划的时候，河头乡党支部书记秦何长的发言，提出了一个新问题。他说，河头乡自从实现了高级合作化以后，乡和社的干部中流行着一种危险的论调：“社会主义合作化，不用领导也走不差。”说农业社是“磨不推自转，船不摇自行”，“政治思想工作不需要了”。于是，政治思想工作取消了，农业社逢五排十的读报制度中断了，民校的政治课取消了，生产总结评比的时候，也没有“比政治”的内容了。
    秦何长的发言向县委敲响了第一声警钟。
    县委书记范任卿对坐在他旁边的宣传部长吕根山说：“河头乡的农业社是先进的农业社，过去一直是注意政治思想工作的，高级合作化以后还发生这样的情况，我们应当摸一摸底，看这是不是一个普遍性的问题。”趁会议的空隙，范任卿和吕根山分别召开了乡支部书记座谈会。座谈会反映的有关政治思想工作的情况并不多。范任卿和吕根山认为，这正说明了问题的严重性：高级合作化以后，谁也不去了解和研究社员的思想情况了，谁也不去注意政治思想工作了。
    潞安县委会决定以宣传部为主组织了考察组，分赴魏家庄、苏店等六个有代表性的基点乡进行考察。考察组发现干部中比较普遍的说法是：“全乡合作化，群众劲头大，除了抓生产，再没工作啦”。韩店乡党的分支书记王志平就公开这样讲：“光靠政治工作打不出粮食来，搞好生产就是政治工作。”因此他每天跳进井筒里挖井，对社里的政治思想工作不管也不问。池里村分支部书记王文生，是党的宣传员，高级合作化以后，他宣称：“宣传工作不需要了。”带头辞掉了宣传员的职务，宣传网也就无形中跟着解散了。县委考察组的人问他们：“为什么不作政治思想工作了？”东苗村支部书记乔贵德回答的很妙，他说：“生产工作能兑现，政治工作看不见。”还有些人企图用劳动管理来代替复杂细致的思想工作。他们说：取消了生产资料私有制，生产有定额，劳动有工分，不怕社员们不积极。
    事实上，农业社里的情况是怎么样的呢？许多社员在长期的个体经营中所养成的习惯势力和自私、保守心理和新的生产关系发生了尖锐的矛盾。为了抢工分，不顾农活质量、损坏牲畜和农具等现象到处发现。苏店农业社劳动组长王来清，为了抢工分，耙坏了十二亩麦苗，估计每亩要减产八九斗以上。南沟农业社社员邢景迷往地里送粪的时候，只顾快跑不给牲口喝水吃草，把牲口累倒起不来了。甚至发生了这样的事情，琚寨乡一个农业社饲养员侯福祥，为了喂肥牲畜得奖金，他在半夜里牵着牲口去吃社里的麦苗子。
    潞安县委研究了这些情况以后，召开了全县政治思想工作会议。
    这次会议上，有十几个乡支部报告了政治思想工作的经验和教训。这里边有“琚寨支部在合作化大生产运动中进行政治思想工作的经验”。琚寨五星农业社社员们讨论1956年生产计划的时候，大家对党支部提出每亩增产粮食106斤的增产计划草案，表示怀疑。这时候，党支部动员了党的全体宣传员，首先向社员们反复地宣传了“农业发展纲要”（草案）和劳动模范李顺达、武侯梨等社员建设山区的故事，鼓舞起了社员们的增产信心。接着，党支部又领导各个田间生产队，总结经验，挖掘增产潜力，组织社员积肥和兴修水利工程。党内外的右倾保守思想受到批判后，在短短的几十天里，全社积肥十一万担，打旱井一百多眼，并修建了一座蓄水池和一座小型蓄水库，另外一条三里长一丈五尺宽的活水渠，也基本建成了。
    和琚寨支部的情况相反的是荫城乡支部。这个支部，由于忽视了农业社中的政治思想工作，全社从上到下滋长了严重的麻痹思想。他们竟把社里的十一头好牲畜，交给刚入社的十一户地主富农分子（已改变成份）负责使用和喂养。社干部们认为“地主富农分子喂养大骡子大马有经验”。结果，这些人不但把十一头牲畜喂得落了膘，而且把一头好马活活地打死了。
    听了这些报告，在小组会上，每个人都对忽视党的政治思想工作的现象进行了揭发和批判。
    韩店乡小组认真地开展了批评和自我批评。那个只顾自己打井挣工分的分支部书记王志平，作的自我检查不够深刻。乡总支副书记宋根旺就对他提出了尖锐的批评：“你是分支书记，不领导群众；你又是宣传员，不作宣传工作，用党员标准量一量自己，看还够不够？”黎明农业社支部书记赵成旺也批评他道：“你不管社的工作，光知道埋头生产挣工分，把个人利益放在党的利益上边了，共产党员就能这样吗？”王志平在大家的帮助下，进一步批判了自己的错误，并表示决心改正。韩店乡小组还积极地想出许多具体措施，来加强农业社的政治思想工作。
    会议结束后，根据会议通过的全县1956年政治思想工作全面规划，全县各乡各社都展开了爱社运动。各社都向全体社员宣传了全国的、全县的以及全社的远景规划，然后通过修订生产计划，计算收入，使每个社员都认识到社里增产，社员幸福，社里减产，社员困难，也正如许多社员自己所说的：“社里损失一个谷穗，也有我的一个谷粒”“爱社就是爱自己”。在社员的社会主义思想提高的基础上，各乡党组织又发动社员根据社里每季的生产计划，和当前的生产活动，按照个人的不同职务，提出自己爱社的具体行动计划。
    经过一系列的思想教育，社员和农业社的关系已经起了新的变化，很多人都懂得了怎样正确地处理个人利益和集体利益的关系。爱社模范一批接着一批涌现出来了。
