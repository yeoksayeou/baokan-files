    No One to Care for the Children, Sick Leave Not Allowed
    Two-thirds of the employees at the local state-owned Shijiazhuang Textile Factory are female workers. However, this factory shows indifference to the welfare of its female workers. The entire factory does not have a single nursery. Because there is no nursery, many female workers have no one to look after their children. Recently, the nanny of Yan Guizhen, a young doffer in the fine yarn B shift, left, and she had no one to watch her child. She had to work the night shift and take care of her child during the day. After four or five days, she really couldn't hold on any longer and wanted to ask for leave to find someone to take care of her child. Section Chief Liu Fengcai said that manpower was short and refused her leave. Yan Guizhen said, "If I'm not allowed leave, I'll have to be absent from work." Liu Fengcai said, "Absence is not allowed either!" Yan Guizhen said, "If I'm not allowed leave and not allowed to be absent, are you forcing me to quit the factory?" Liu Fengcai said, "I have no objection to you quitting the factory, write a letter of resignation!" As a result, Yan Guizhen was forced to be absent from work. After she went to work, the League cadres criticized her, the workshop trade union asked her to write a self-criticism, and they even mobilized other workers to find fault with her. Since this incident, Yan Guizhen has developed insomnia.
    The factory also failed to provide due care for sick and pregnant female workers. After Li Shun, a fine yarn worker, became pregnant, she couldn't eat anything for four or five days and vomited severely. She asked the shift leader, Zhao Xiaodong, for leave. The shift leader said that production was busy and refused. She went to the clinic to see a doctor. The gynecologist said, "If you can guarantee that you'll be better in a day, I'll give you a day off." Li Shun said, "I can't guarantee that, you're the doctor, can you guarantee that?" The doctor slammed the record book on the table and said, "No leave allowed!" Li Shun had no choice but to be absent from work.
    The housing problem for female workers has not been well resolved either. Some people do not have fixed dormitories, and they often move after giving birth, so the mothers cannot get good rest. The attitude of the factory leaders towards the suffering of the workers shows that they are too indifferent to the lives of the workers. It is hoped that the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Ministry of Textile Industry will intervene in this matter.　Liu Zeyuan

### 孩子没人带，有病不准假

    孩子没人带，有病不准假
    地方国营石家庄纺织厂的职工中，有三分之二是女工。可是这个厂对女工的生活福利漠不关心。全厂没有一个托儿所。因为没有托儿所，很多女工的孩子没人照管。最近，细纱乙班青年落纱工阎贵珍家的媬姆走了，孩子没人看，她上夜班，白天还得看孩子。四、五天以后，实在坚持不下，想请个假去找人带孩子，工段长刘凤彩说人手少，不准假。阎贵珍说：“不准假，我只好旷工了。”刘凤彩说：“旷工也不行！”阎贵珍说：“不准假，不准旷工，你迫我退厂吗？”刘凤彩说：“退厂我没意见，你写辞职书吧！”结果，逼得阎贵珍旷工了。等她上班以后，团的干部批评她，车间工会要她写检讨，还发动其它工人专找她的毛病。自从这件事发生以后，阎贵珍已经得了失眠症。
    对生病的和怀孕的女工，厂里也没有给以应有的照顾。细纱女工李顺怀孕以后，四五天不能吃东西，吐得很厉害，向值班长赵小东请假。值班长说生产忙，不准。她又到医务室看病。妇科大夫说：“如果你保证一天能好，我就给你一天假。”李顺说：“我保证不了，你是大夫，你能保证吗？”这位大夫把本子往桌上一摔，说“不准假！”李顺最后没法，也只好旷工了。
    女工的住房问题也没很好解决。有些人没固定宿舍，生了孩子以后，常常搬家，产妇不能很好地休养。这个厂的领导人员对职工的疾苦，采取这样的态度，说明他们太不关心职工生活了。希望中共石家庄市委会，纺织工业部出来干预这件事。　刘泽源
