Xinhua News Agency, Hegang, July 20th. The newly built Xing'an Tai vertical shaft of the Hegang Mining Bureau officially went into production today. This pair of vertical shafts has been named the Xing'an Coal Mine, and its annual output is approximately one-third of the Hegang Mining Bureau's total coal production this year.

The construction of the Xing'an Tai vertical shaft began on August 1, 1952. Of the 114 projects in this pair of vertical shafts, 86 were rated as excellent, 26 as good, and 2 as fair after technical appraisal, with no substandard projects. The acceptance committee believes that the Xing'an Tai vertical shaft project has met the quality standards and is currently a first-class quality mine in China's coal mine construction.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the eve of the Xing'an Tai vertical shaft going into production, the construction strength of the Hegang Shaft Construction Engineering Office has grown from being able to construct two pairs of vertical shafts to being able to construct four pairs. From 1950 to the present, this shaft construction team has successively built two pairs of modern vertical shafts (the Dongshan vertical shaft and the Xing'an Tai vertical shaft) in the Hegang mining area, and has trained a large number of workers with skilled shaft construction technology.

Due to the continuous improvement of the employees' shaft construction technology, the two pairs of vertical shafts successively built by this shaft construction team in the Hegang mining area were built faster and with better quality each time. Although the scale of the Xing'an Tai vertical shaft is much larger than that of the Xin Yi Mine vertical shaft, the construction time was one year shorter than that of the Xin Yi Mine. The employees now confidently say that if they build a new vertical shaft, it will be even faster.

Currently, this shaft construction team is preparing to send a large number of personnel to support the mine construction projects in the new mining areas.

### 鹤岗兴安台竖井投入生产  建井队伍力量壮大技术提高

    鹤岗兴安台竖井投入生产
    建井队伍力量壮大技术提高
    新华社鹤岗20日电　鹤岗矿务局新建的兴安台竖井今天正式投入生产。这对竖井已经被命名为兴安煤矿，它的年产量约等于鹤岗矿务局今年产煤总量的三分之一。
    兴安台竖井是从1952年8月1日动工兴建的。这对竖井的工程质量，在验收的114项工程中，经过技术鉴定被评为优等的有八十六项，良等的二十六项，中等的二项，没有劣等工程。验收委员会认为兴安台竖井的工程达到了质量标准，是目前中国煤矿建设中头等质量的矿井。
    据新华社讯　在兴安台竖井投入生产前夕，鹤岗建井工程处的建井力量，已经由建设两对竖井壮大到能够建设四对竖井。这支建井队伍从1950年到现在，曾经连续在鹤岗矿区建成了两对现代化的竖井
  （东山竖井和兴安台竖井），锻炼出了大批具有熟练建井技术的工人。
    由于职工的建井技术不断提高，这支建井队伍在鹤岗矿区先后建成的两对竖井，一对比一对快，质量也越来越好。兴安台竖井的规模虽然比新一矿竖井大得多，但是建井时间比新一矿缩短了一年。职工们现在都有信心地说，如果再建新竖井，时间还会更快些。
    现在，这支建井队伍正在准备抽出大批力量支援新矿区的矿井建设工程。
