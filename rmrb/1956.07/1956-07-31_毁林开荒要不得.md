Reckless Deforestation for Cultivation Must Be Stopped

The phenomenon of deforestation for cultivation has occurred in many parts of Heilongjiang Province. These policy-violating acts are mostly committed by state-owned farms. It is understood that state-owned farms in Tongbei, Hongxing, Hailin and other places have destroyed 2,211 hectares of forest land and 29 million young trees due to land reclamation alone. The state-owned Hongxing Farm alone destroyed 900 hectares of forest for cultivation, and burned the small trees that farmers had been cultivating on the mountains for several years, causing a very bad influence among the masses. The state-owned Hailin Farm also included hillsides covered with dense young forests in its reclamation plans, and organized nearby farmers to cut and beat the young forests without requesting approval from any leading authorities, turning more than 570 hectares of green hillsides into barren mountains. The state-owned Tongbei Farm and Yian Labor Reform Farm also have the phenomenon of deforestation for cultivation. Under such influence, the masses around the farms also generally cut and beat young forests.

The main reason for the above problems is that the leaders of many farms do not have a clear understanding of the principles of cultivating land suitable for agriculture and planting trees suitable for forestry. Therefore, some farms cut down a large number of young forests as long as they see that the land is contiguous and easy for mechanized farming. Another reason is that some state-owned farms lack comprehensive planning. For example, the state-owned Hailin Farm plans to have 15,000 hectares of cultivated land. In order to complete this unrealistic land reclamation plan, it has to destroy the forest.

We suggest that the leading organs of Heilongjiang Province conduct an inspection and deal with this issue, and suggest that when formulating a provincial land reclamation plan, attention should be paid to comprehensively arranging and resolving the contradiction between land reclamation and greening work.

### 毁林开荒要不得

    毁林开荒要不得
    黑龙江很多地方发生了毁林开荒的现象，这些违反政策的行为大都是国营农场干的。据了解，仅国营通北、红星、海林等机械农场，就因开荒而毁掉林地2，211公顷，毁坏幼林2，900万株。只国营红星农场为开荒而毁林的面积就达900公顷，把农民几年来封山育林的小树放火烧掉，在群众中造成很坏的影响。国营海林农场把生长着茂密幼林的山岗也规划在开垦对象以内，未请示任何领导机关批准就组织附近农民割打幼林，使570多公顷绿山坡变成秃山。国营通北农场、依安劳改农场也存在毁林开荒的现象。在这样影响下，农场周围群众也普遍割打幼林。
    产生上述问题的主要原因是很多农场的领导对于宜农开地，宜林植树的原则没有明确的认识。因此有的农场只要看到土地连片便于机耕就大量砍掉幼林。另一个原因是有的国营农场缺乏全面规划。如国营海林农场规划要有耕地一万五千公顷。为了完成这个不切实际的开荒计划，就不得不毁掉树林。
    我们建议黑龙江省领导机关对于这个问题进行检查处理，并建议制定全省垦荒计划时，注意全面安排解决垦荒和绿化工作的矛盾。
