Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th. After the surveying personnel of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway planted line marker stakes, indicating the direction of the railway's advance, all the way from Lanzhou to Yinchuan, known as "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," they have now dismantled their tents from the mountains and the vast desert, and returned to Lanzhou with boxes of design materials, having successfully completed the detailed field survey work.

The survey of this railway section began in 1952. Over the past four years, after repeated comparisons, a relatively ideal route was finally selected. This section of the railway is 473 kilometers long, and after it is connected with the Baotou-Yinchuan section in the future, it will become a major transportation artery connecting North and Northwest China.

Construction workers have already started building the roadbed in advance between Lanzhou and Dijiatai. The project north of Dijiatai will also commence successively.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 20th. The location for the junction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the railway from Aktogay, Soviet Union, has been selected. The location of the junction is Alashankou, west of Ebi Lake and north of Bole in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Currently, our surveying personnel have already planted line marker stakes at the junction point, and a colorful archway with the words "Road of Eternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Peoples" written in both Chinese and Soviet languages has been erected at the junction site. A station close to the junction has been named "Erhelili" (meaning "Friendship" in Mongolian).

The work of selecting the junction location for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Soviet railway began last winter. Our surveying personnel, stepping on accumulated snow and braving the severe cold of minus forty degrees, conducted route comparison surveys at four locations along the border, including Horgos, Baketu, and Alashankou, before finally determining that Alashankou, with its relatively flat terrain and convenient connection to the Soviet railway, would be the junction location.

    包兰铁路兰州银川段完成定测
    兰新路同苏联铁路的接轨地点选定
    新华社兰州19日电　包兰铁路的勘测人员把显示出铁路前进方向的线路标桩，从兰州一直插到号称“塞外江南”的银川以后，现在已经从丛山里、大沙漠上拆下帐篷，带着一箱箱的设计资料，胜利结束了野外定测工作，回到兰州。
    这段铁路是1952年开始勘测的。四年多以来，经过反复比较，最后才选定了一条比较理想的线路。这段铁路长473公里，将来和包头银川段铁路接轨以后，将成为沟通华北和西北的交通大动脉。
    筑路工人已经先在兰州、狄家台间提前修起路基，狄家台以北的工程，也即将陆续动工。
    新华社兰州20日电　兰新铁路和来自苏联阿克斗卡的铁路接轨地点已经选好。接轨点的位置，在新疆维吾尔自治区的艾比湖以西、博乐以北的阿拉山口。
    现在，我国勘测人员已经在接轨点上插下了线路标桩，接轨地点还搭起了用中苏两国文字写着“中苏人民永恒友谊之路”的彩门。接近接轨地点的一个车站，已经被命名为“额合尔里力”（蒙语“友好”的意思）。
    选择兰新铁路和苏联铁路接轨地点的工作，是去年冬季开始的。我国勘测人员曾经踏着积雪，冒着零下四十度的严寒，在国境一带的霍尔果斯、巴克图、阿拉山口等四处进行了选线比较，最后才确定了地势比较平坦，和苏联铁路接轨比较便捷的阿拉山口为接轨地点。
