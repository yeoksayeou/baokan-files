Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: The first two prefabricated houses made of bamboo-reinforced concrete and bamboo structures in China were completed yesterday afternoon at the construction site of Tongji University in Shanghai.

　　One of these buildings is a bungalow, and the other is a two-story building. Except for the brick walls and tile roof, each component uses processed bamboo materials; steel and wood are almost completely replaced by bamboo here. Bedrooms, lounges, offices, halls, corridors, and stairs are all made of bamboo-reinforced concrete. The roof truss part uses a bamboo structure, and the bamboo roof truss on top of the hall has a span of ten meters and can withstand a heavy pressure of twenty tons.

　　The door panels and flat ceilings made of bamboo materials are sometimes pieced together into twill patterns, and sometimes into checkered patterns. After being planed and painted with brown paint, they are smooth and beautiful, and the natural shape of the bamboo is no longer visible. The window frames made of bamboo fiber magnesite look like steel windows. When the construction project was nearing completion, it was attacked by many storms and a level nine typhoon, but the house did not deform.

　　This project was carried out as an experiment under the auspices of the East China Bamboo Utilization Research Committee. Construction engineers from Shanghai and professors from the Department of Structural Engineering and the Department of Architecture of Tongji University participated in this work. After the two bamboo houses are completed, they will be used as kindergartens for Tongji University.

### 上海建成两幢竹材房屋

    上海建成两幢竹材房屋
    新华社上海15日电　在上海同济大学建筑工地上，我国第一次用竹筋混凝土和竹结构做成的两幢装配式房屋，昨天下午完工了。
    这两幢建筑物，一幢是平房，另一幢是二层楼房。除了砖墙和瓦顶以外，每个构件都用了经过加工的竹材料；钢材和木材在这里几乎全部被竹材代替了。卧室、休息室、办公室、大厅、走廊和楼梯，都是用竹筋混凝土做的。屋架部分用的是竹结构，大厅顶上的竹屋架，跨距达到十公尺，可以承受二十吨的重压。
    用竹材料制成的门扇和平顶，有的拼成斜纹，有的拼成方格花纹，经过刨光，再涂上褐色油漆，平滑美观，已经看不出竹子的天然形状。用竹丝菱苦土做的窗框，看去好像钢窗一样。建筑工程接近完工的时候，曾经受了许多场暴风雨和九级台风的袭击，但是房屋并没有变形。
    这个工程是在华东区竹材利用研究委员会主持下作为试验进行的。上海市的建筑工程师和同济大学结构系、建筑系的教授们，都参加了这个工作。两幢竹材房屋建成以后，将用作同济大学托儿所。
