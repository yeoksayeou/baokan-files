Do Not Underrate Nursing Work
Kang Tongbi

Generally, people still do not pay enough attention to nurses and nursing work, considering it an insignificant job. This view is incorrect.

A doctor's responsibility to a patient is to examine, diagnose, and prescribe. A nurse, on the other hand, provides round-the-clock care, assisting the doctor in routine examinations, administering injections and medications, bandaging wounds, recording patient conditions, arranging the environment, comforting and supporting patients, and so on. It can be said that their care is meticulous. Good nursing care can make treatment twice as effective with half the effort, while poor nursing care can lead to half the effect with twice the effort.

"Nursing" is a specialized discipline that requires a broad foundation of scientific knowledge, as well as noble character, gentle disposition, meticulous thinking, and precise analytical and judgment skills. But how do we treat this discipline and work?

The Five-Year Plan only includes figures for hospital beds and doctors; there is no place for nursing in scientific research departments and higher education; the published works and translated books in the nursing profession account for only a tiny minority, and there is currently only one magazine; nurses' salaries can only reach the sixth grade of the second tier, there are no expert positions, and welfare is not taken care of. There are countless unreasonable facts.

Nursing education currently falls within the scope of secondary vocational school education, meaning it is studied by junior high school graduates for a period of two to three years, with no further education institutions available. A nurse needs to possess the basic knowledge of general medical school courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry, anatomy, pathology, parasitology, microbiology, physiology, and pharmacology; they also need to study the basic knowledge of clinical specialties, such as internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, urology, ENT, dermatology, X-ray, and physiotherapy; in addition, they have their own professional courses, such as nursing, hygiene, nutrition, psychology, ward management, as well as first aid, dispensing, and so on. Furthermore, they should also study special nursing in various departments, infant and child care, and individual care for special diseases, and so on. It is quite difficult for a fifteen or sixteen-year-old student who has just graduated from junior high school to learn and apply so many specialized courses in two or three years.

Universities and colleges do not have nursing departments, and research institutions do not have a nursing major. It is very unreasonable to confine this complex and meticulous discipline to the educational scope of secondary vocational schools.

Because the general public has a dismissive attitude towards the nursing profession, and the health department does not pay enough attention to this profession, students believe that nursing is a career with no prospects when choosing schools and determining their aspirations, and are unwilling to apply for this major. Apart from a few students who love nursing work, almost all of them are students with poor grades who believe they are not qualified to study engineering, and then embark on the path of studying nursing. As a result, the source of students has dried up, and the nursing profession is even less valued.

Nurses' work is very heavy and tiring, but their work is not valued (generally, people only know about doctors but not about nurses), there are no development prospects (salaries and positions are limited to the sixth grade of the second tier), there are no opportunities for further study (no time to read, no money to buy books, and no books to buy), and some old nurses who already have advanced knowledge and experience do not receive the treatment and care of senior intellectuals. The vast majority of those engaged in nursing work are women, who must marry after adulthood, have children after marriage, and handle housework. Their working hours include day shifts, night shifts, small night shifts, and split shifts, which are rotated. It is difficult for families and children to receive proper care, and because of low wages and no special welfare (the original night shift food allowance has been cancelled), they get up early and go to bed late, do not get rest, and their work mood is unstable, which affects their health and also affects their work. Hospitals generally have a fixed quota of nurses, and maternity leave, sick leave, and regular leave are often not replaced by anyone. Sometimes, in order not to affect work, they have to work while sick. This phenomenon is quite common.

From the above situations, we can see the serious situation in nursing work at present, and at the same time, we can imagine what the possible consequences are.

The above is my personal opinion, which I offer to the people of the whole country, hoping that the relevant government departments, medical and nursing practitioners, public opinion, and all parties will pay attention to this issue. Let everyone study and discuss whether the nursing work has been undervalued or not valued enough in the past and present? What are the possible consequences, what are the ways to improve, and what is the correct path? I hope that these issues can be resolved through everyone's research and discussion, so that the people's health care can be continuously developed and improved.

    不要轻视护士工作
    康同璧
    一般人对于护士和护理工作，多少还不够重视，认为这是一种无足轻重的工作，这个看法是不对的。
    医生对于病人的职责，是检查、诊断和处方，而护士对于病人，则是每天二十四小时的调护，辅助医生作例行的诊察、打针、侍药、包扎伤口、记载病情、配置环境、对病人进行慰借和扶持，等等，可以说是无微不至。护理工作做得好，可以使治疗工作事半功倍，做得不好，可能造成事倍功半。
        “护理”是一种专门学术，需要广泛的科学常识作基础，更需要高尚的品德，温和的性格，细致的思想，以及精确的分析和判断能力。可是，这样的一门学术和工作，我们是怎样地对待它的呢？
    五年计划中只有病床位和医师的数字；科学研究部门和高等教育中，没有护病学的位置；已出版的著作和翻译的图书，在护理专业方面仅占极少数，杂志刊物现在只有一种；护士的待遇最高只能达到二等六级，没有专家地位的设置，福利方面没有照顾，种种不合理的事实，不胜枚举。
    护理教育，目前是属于中等专业学校教育范围内的，即由初中毕业生来学习，期限是二至三年，此外更无进修机构。一个护士要具备一般医学校课程的基础知识，即生物、物理、化学、解剖、病理、寄生虫、微生物、生理、药物等科目；还要学习临床方面的各专门科目，如内科、外科、小儿科、产妇科、泌尿科、五官科、皮肤科、爱克斯光科、理疗科等等的常识；此外，还有他们自己的专业课程，如护病、卫生、营养、心理、病房管理，以及急救、调剂等等科目；更进一步，他们还应当学习各科的特别护理、婴幼护理和特殊病症的个别护理，等等。这样许多的专门课程，要一个初中毕业的十五六岁学生，在两三年内学以致用，实在是一件相当困难的事。
    大学和高等学校，没有护士这一院系，研究机构中，没有护士这一个专业，使这一种复杂细致的学科，限制在中等专业学校的教育范围以内，这是十分不合理的事。
    因为社会上一般人对于护士这一种职业，有着轻视的心理，卫生部门又对于这一专业重视得不够，所以学生们在投考学校确定志愿的时候，认为护士是一种没有出息的职业，不愿意投考这一专业。除了一部分喜爱护士工作的学生以外，差不多都是成绩较差自认为学工科不够资格的学生，才走上学护士的道路。这样，学生的来源枯竭了，护士的职业，就更加不被重视了。
    护士的工作很繁重、劳累，但他们的工作得不到重视（一般是只知有医不知有护），没有发展前途（工资和地位最高只限于二等六级），没有进修机会（无时间读书，无钱买书，买不到书），还有一些已有高深造诣和经验的老护士们，得不到高级知识分子的待遇和照顾。绝大多数从事护士工作的是妇女，她们成年后都要结婚，婚后都要生育子女，都要处理家务。她们的工作时间有日班、夜班、小夜班、两头班，轮流替换，家庭和子女难以得到适当的照顾，而且因为工资少，福利无特殊照顾（原有夜班伙食津贴已取消），起早睡晚，不得休息，工作情绪不定，影响了健康，也影响了工作。医院的护士，一般是按定额配备的，产假、病假、例假，常常无人替换，有时为了不影响工作，只得带病值班，这种现象，是相当普遍的。
    从上面所说的一些情况，我们可以看到目前护士工作中的严重情况，同时也可以想像到什么是可能的后果。
    上面是我个人的意见，谨向全国人民提供出来，希望政府有关部门，医护从业人员，社会舆论，各方面都来重视这一个问题。大家研究讨论，是否过去和现在对护士工作有轻视或重视得不够的情况？什么是可能的后果，什么是改进的办法，什么是正确的道路？希望这些问题在大家的研究和讨论下获得解决，使人民的保健事业能够得到不断的发展和提高。
