Xinhua News Agency, July 24th – The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China recently issued instructions to the Civil Affairs Departments and Bureaus of all provinces, regions, and municipalities, as well as the Civil Affairs Bureaus of the thirty larger cities, regarding the work of resettling and reforming vagrants. The instructions pointed out that since the arrival of the socialist upsurge, employment opportunities in cities have increased. Influenced by the new situation, many vagrants have already changed, some have already found employment, and some are about to be employed. The vagrants who need resettlement and reform in the future are mainly those who have long been engaged in non-productive labor, have no legitimate occupation or employment conditions, and are unable to maintain their lives, resorting to improper means such as theft, abduction, gambling, and begging. To avoid wrongful detention, the following types of people should not be treated as vagrants: (1) employed personnel and temporary workers who occasionally engage in improper behavior; (2) unemployed and jobless people and farmers and disaster victims flowing into cities who have no improper behavior or only minor improper behavior; (3) people who had improper behavior in the past but have now corrected it. In addition, criminal offenders among vagrants should be handled by the judicial and public security departments and should not be treated as targets for resettlement and reform by the civil affairs departments.

The instructions require that the principle of "combining reform with resettlement" must be resolutely implemented in the work of vagrant reform, that is, not only to organize vagrants to participate in productive labor, so that they gradually change their idle habits and develop labor habits; but also to regard the places where they are reformed as places where they are permanently resettled, so that they can obtain legitimate occupations and reliable sources of livelihood, and will not be displaced again and return to the path of vagrancy. As for the methods of resettlement and reform, farms can be established, or they can be scattered and placed in agricultural production cooperatives, or sent back to their original rural areas for supervision and reform by the masses. Vagrants who are not suitable for agricultural production can be resettled and reformed in other ways. Disabled, elderly vagrants who have basically lost their ability to work and some children with idle habits and improper behavior should not be treated the same as ordinary vagrants. Those who have families to return to should be responsible for their upbringing; those who have no families to return to should be sent to homes for the disabled and elderly and children's homes respectively.

The instructions pointed out that when dealing with the centralized reception of vagrants, the principle of voluntarism must be adhered to, and no coercive or disguised coercive measures should be taken.

The instructions finally pointed out that resettling and reforming vagrants is an important task that cannot be ignored in the socialist transformation of cities and an important task for the civil affairs departments at present. The civil affairs departments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and cities must actively and steadily carry out this work in accordance with the spirit of the instructions.

    内务部发出安置改造游民工作的指示
    要求贯彻改造同安置相结合的方针
    新华社24日讯　中华人民共和国内务部最近向各省区、市的民政厅、局以及三十个较大城市的民政局发出了关于安置改造游民工作的指示。指示指出：社会主义高潮到来以后，城市中的就业门路已经增多，游民在新形势的影响下，不少人已经有了转变，他们有的已经就业，有的即将就业。今后需要安置改造的游民，主要是长期不从事劳动生产，没有正当职业和就业条件，以致无法维持生活，而以偷窃、拐骗、聚赌、乞食等不正当手段谋生的分子。为了避免错收，对于下列几种人，不应当作为游民来处理：（一）偶有不正当行为的在业人员和临时工；（二）没有不正当行为或者仅有轻微不正当行为的失业、无业人员和农村流入城市的农民、灾民；（三）过去有不正当行为、现在已经改正的人。此外，对于游民当中的刑事犯罪分子，则应该由司法、公安部门处理，不应由民政部门当做安置改造的对象。
    指示要求在游民改造工作中必须坚决贯彻“改造同安置相结合”的方针，即不仅要组织游民参加劳动生产，使他们逐步改变游惰习气，养成劳动习惯；也要把改造他们的场所，作为长期安置他们的地方，使他们从此获得正当职业和可靠的生活来源，不致再流离失所，重新走上游民的道路。至于安置改造的方式，可以举办农场或采取分散安插到农业生产合作社，以及送回原籍农村由群众监督改造等办法。对于不适于从事农业生产的游民，可以采取其他方式进行安置改造。对于一部分基本上已经丧失劳动力的残废老年游民和一部分有游惰习气和不正当行为的儿童，不应同一般游民混同对待。其中有家可归的应由家庭负责教养；无家可归的应分别送入残老教养院和儿童教养院。
    指示指出：在集中收容处理游民的时候，必须坚持自愿原则，不能采取任何强制或变相强制的作法。
    指示最后指出：安置改造游民，是城市社会主义改造方面一项不容忽视的工作，也是民政部门当前一项重要任务。各省、自治区和城市的民政部门必须根据指示的精神，积极地稳步地开展这一项工作。
