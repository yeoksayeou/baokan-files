Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 23rd: The letter to Socialist workers, unanimously adopted by the Fourteenth Congress of the French Communist Party, hopes that the Socialist Party will respond to the call for unified action. The letter states that the growing support of the working people for united action between the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party indicates that "unified action is not only necessary but also possible."

The letter states that even if the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have differences on the path and means of building socialism, the two parties' positions are close on many issues. Both parties' constitutions and programs express the desire to strive for socialism, and both parties declare themselves to be parties of class struggle aimed at establishing socialism, and advocates of democratic freedom.

The call to action states: "The elections of January 2nd marked a clear shift to the left, making it possible to form a government led by Socialists... Without a doubt, a government that relies on the united front of the working class and unites a new and broad popular front around itself will be able to implement a broad program of peaceful, democratic society, which will open the road to the realization of our common aspirations – towards socialism."

The letter states: "The Communist Party believes that the people will do their best to utilize parliamentary institutions to change the social system. However, the Communist Party will not forget that due to the resistance of the bourgeoisie, the form of the struggle will not always be peaceful. Whether to eliminate dictatorship by peaceful means or by violent means does not depend on the working class, but on whether the reactionary bourgeoisie attempts to stubbornly maintain the old order."

The letter addresses the Algerian issue. It emphasizes that the two parties may be able to find ways and means to achieve a ceasefire through direct negotiations and accelerate the establishment of peace on the Algerian issue. It may now be possible to find a decision that can satisfy the legitimate demands of the Algerian people and provide the possibility for France and Algeria to freely unite on an equal basis.

### 法共代表大会通过告社会党劳动者书  希望社会党和共产党行动统一

    法共代表大会通过告社会党劳动者书
    希望社会党和共产党行动统一
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党第十四次代表大会一致通过的告社会党劳动者书，希望社会党响应行动统一的号召。告社会党劳动者书说，愈来愈多的劳动人民广泛支持法国共产党和社会党的行动统一，“行动统一不但是必要的，而且是可能的”。
    告社会党劳动者书说，即使共产党和社会党在建设社会主义的道路和手段的问题上存在着分歧，但是两党在许多问题上的立场是接近的。在两党的党章和党纲上都写明对争取社会主义的愿望，两党都宣布自己是以建立社会主义为目的的阶级斗争的政党，是民主自由的拥护者。
    这个号召书说：“一月二日的选举标志出明显的向左转趋势，这次选举使得有可能成立以社会党人为首的政府。……毫无疑问，政府只要依靠工人阶级的统一战线和把新的广泛的人民阵线团结在自己周围，就会有可能实现广泛的和平民主的社会纲领，这个纲领将为实现我们的共同愿望——通向社会主义打开道路。”
    号召书说：“共产党认为，人民将尽力利用议会机构来改变社会制度。但是，共产党不会忘记，由于资产阶级的反抗，斗争的形式不会永远是和平性质的。用和平的手段还是用暴力手段来消灭独裁，这并不取决于工人阶级，而是要看反动资产阶级是不是企图顽固地保持过去的东西。”
    号召书谈到阿尔及利亚问题。它着重指出，两个党在阿尔及利亚问题上有可能找到通过直接谈判达成停火和加速树立和平的方法和形式。现在也许可能找到一个决定，这个决定能够满足阿尔及利亚人民合法要求，而且能提供可能，使法国和阿尔及利亚在平等的基础上实行自由联合。
