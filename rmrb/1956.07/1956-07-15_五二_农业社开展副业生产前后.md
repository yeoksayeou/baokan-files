Before and After the "May 2nd" Agricultural Cooperative Developed Sideline Production
	Zhen Sheng

Farmers in Liu Fotang Township, Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, have traditionally had the habit of engaging in sideline production. Sideline income accounts for a significant proportion of farmers' annual total income. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative last winter, due to the cooperative's leadership lacking a comprehensive view of production, many sideline activities were suspended. According to a survey of 38 households in Liu Bao Village and Dong Shulinzi Village within the cooperative, in 1954, there were 74 sheep raised, but currently there are only 30. In 1954, there were 12 sows raised, which decreased to five in 1955, and only four remained in 1956. Due to the reduction in sows, the breeding volume decreased, and the sales volume of fattened pigs decreased year by year. In 1954, 41 fattened pigs were sold, 40 were sold in 1955, and only 11 were sold this year.

The decline in sideline production has significantly reduced the income of cooperative members. For example, in the former Tuanjie Cooperative, the average sideline income per household in 1954 was 74 yuan, while in 1956, the estimated sideline income per household is at most 34 yuan. The collective sideline production operated by the cooperative has also been neglected. For example, the sideline income of the original "May 2nd" Cooperative accounted for 13.5% of the agricultural income that year in 1954, while the planned sideline income this year (before planning) only accounts for 0.27% of the agricultural income. In short, both the sideline production of cooperative members' families and the collective sideline production of the cooperative are in a state of decline.

Why did Sideline Production Decrease?

Why did this phenomenon occur? According to the situation in this township, there are three reasons: First, the cooperative cadres lacked experience in such large-scale socialist collective production, and they failed to consider all aspects of production management. They only saw the importance of agricultural production (which is correct) but did not see the important role of sideline production in increasing the income of cooperative members and supporting agricultural production. For example, some people believe that "engaging in sideline production is throwing away the big head to grab the small head," and some believe that "setting up one more stall means one more thing to worry about; it is better to focus on one thing." In particular, they have a one-sided understanding of the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," only recognizing that reducing expenses everywhere is thrift, but lacking understanding of how to actively open up production avenues and increase sources of funds. Second, they not only failed to specifically organize and support the sideline production of cooperative members' families, but even restricted their activities. Cooperative members did not know whether the cooperative would supply the feed needed for their cattle and sheep (usually peanut stalks and sweet potato vines) after the autumn harvest, nor did they know whether the cooperative would allow them to take some work time to engage in sideline production. Therefore, they lacked confidence in developing sideline production. Some cooperatives have imposed excessively strict restrictions on the activities of cooperative members, blocking small-scale sideline production avenues. For example, in the 18th Production Team, Cui Guochen and several other cooperative members went out to carry soil salt to sell a few times during the spare time of spring plowing in order to solve their livelihood difficulties, and the team criticized them for having "capitalist ideas." Cooperative members reflected, "The advanced cooperative is good, but there is no pocket money to spend, and it is unbearably difficult." Third, during the high tide of cooperativization, the policy propaganda was not comprehensive, and the farmers engaged in sideline production were not confident in the policy, fearing that the cattle, sheep, and pig herds would all be collectivized, so some blindly sold them and were unwilling to continue operating.

Calculating Three Accounts

The stagnation of sideline production has seriously affected the lives of cooperative members and has gradually attracted the attention of the cooperative management committee. Recently, with the help of the superior work team, a sideline production plan has been formulated based on various conditions. The planning method is:

First, calculate detailed accounts to find losses and improve ideological understanding. The entire cooperative calculated three accounts. The first account made everyone realize that, because the cooperative neglected sideline production, it greatly reduced the source of income, which not only affected the daily lives of cooperative members but also affected the cooperative's production investment. For example, the cooperative still lacks sixty livestock according to needs, but it has no way to complete the stock due to limited funds. As a result, some teams missed the farming season during spring plowing, and the full implementation of three hoeings and three weedings was not guaranteed during summer weeding. The second account made everyone realize that, due to the weakening of cooperative members' family sideline production, the actual income of each cooperative member this year decreased by an average of 16 yuan compared to 1955, and the total income of 1,215 households in the cooperative decreased by 19,440 yuan. To make up for this amount with agriculture, the harvest of ninety hectares of land is needed. Even if the cooperative's agriculture can increase grain production by nine hundred shi this year, the income of cooperative members will still not increase. The third account made everyone realize that, due to the decline in the output of various sideline productions, not only the income of the cooperative and its members was affected, but also the needs of urban and rural people and the national construction were unfavorable. Taking the item of live pigs as an example, in 1954, these 1,215 households in the whole cooperative sold 214,100 jin of pork, while this year they can only sell 11,064 jin, which will naturally affect the state's need for pork.

There were originally many production avenues

On the basis of raising awareness, everyone's enthusiasm for developing sideline production is very high. Then, based on local actual conditions, the direction of sideline production development was studied. The cooperative plans to quickly restore and develop the breeding industry (including cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, etc.), kiln industry, transportation industry, flour mills, tofu workshops, weaving industry, as well as iron, wood, leather, willow and other sideline productions from this year to next year. According to the nature and characteristics of each sideline production, the kiln industry, breeding industry, and workshops are identified as perennial sideline production, and the remaining items such as transportation, weaving, iron, wood, and willow are seasonal sidelines, which can be stopped during the busy farming season. Some of these sideline productions meet the needs of the cooperative's production and basic construction, and some products are sold, and generally have certain uses and sales channels.

In the planning, according to the principle of taking both public and private interests into consideration, appropriate divisions of labor were made for cooperative-operated and member-operated activities. Relatively large-scale sideline projects that are inconvenient for cooperative members to operate individually, such as transportation, kiln industry, iron, wood, leather, and willow, are all uniformly operated by the cooperative. Other items such as weaving and breeding are jointly operated by the cooperative and its members. Some are operated by cooperative members individually with the support of the cooperative. In addition, the cooperative also decided that cooperative members can go out to do some physical transportation and sell small labor during the slack season, with the permission of the cooperative, to increase personal income.

The development of these sideline productions is determined according to conditions such as the availability of raw materials, wide sales channels, and operating capabilities. First of all, focus is placed on the development of live pig production. It is planned that from now until next year, the number of sows in the cooperative will increase from the current 130 to 230 (of which 100 are operated by the cooperative and 130 are operated by cooperative members) to increase the number of piglets bred and supply the needs of cooperative members to raise pigs. It is required that each cooperative member household raise an average of two pigs next year. The sales volume of fattened pigs will increase from 790 this year to 1,500. The pig feed problem has been studied and solved by planting pumpkins, flour mill pulp residue, and collecting wild grass. In addition, the bran and chaff from each cooperative member's family is completely sufficient. According to the local shortage of pastures, it is determined that the number of cattle and sheep will basically remain at the existing breeding level. As for the small number of cattle and sheep operated by cooperative members themselves, the cooperative should distribute the necessary feed as much as possible. Other kiln industries and workshops have also been appropriately arranged.

After the production plan was made, labor was uniformly planned to ensure the labor needs of agriculture and sideline production, and to prevent possible conflicts. According to the actual number of workdays reported by cooperative members, in addition to completing the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production, more than 7,000 mobile workdays can be spared. As long as the labor force is well organized, the sideline production plan can be realized with confidence while doing a good job in agricultural production.

Cooperative members' income has begun to increase

After the plan was formulated, it was widely publicized among the masses, and sideline productions that could be started immediately were started. This transformation quickly achieved results. The trust and enthusiasm of cooperative members in the cooperative has greatly increased. According to this plan, the total sideline income of the cooperative can increase by 177,150 yuan throughout the year (including collective sideline production of the cooperative and family sideline production of cooperative members). This income is equivalent to 22.1% of the cooperative's agricultural income. After the sideline plan is realized, the average income of each cooperative member will increase by 32.8% compared to the original planned income. In the second half of this year, cooperative members will be able to receive 42,100 yuan of sideline income, and each household can receive about 35 yuan more than before the development of sideline production.

After the planning, there are more production avenues, and the utilization rate of the labor force has also been greatly improved. The labor force that was previously considered to have no place to be put has been fully utilized, and the elderly and weak labor force also has broad prospects. The total labor utilization rate of the cooperative has increased by 38.8% compared to before.

The development of sideline production has also supported and promoted the development of agricultural production. The development of animal husbandry and poultry breeding has increased fertilizer for the cooperative. Raising pigs and sheep alone can accumulate high-quality manure for the cooperative that can cover 850 hectares of land throughout the year.

In order to realize the above-mentioned sideline production plan, the cooperative has determined a person specifically responsible for leading sideline production. Now, the cooperative's collective pig farm has been basically completed, the brick kiln has signed a contract with users for 70,000 bricks, and the kiln has been fired. During summer weeding, 60 laborers were also drawn to reclaim wasteland at the Panshan Farm. The total sideline income of the cooperative has now reached about 4,000 yuan.

    “五二”农业社开展副业生产前后
    震生
    辽宁北镇县刘佛堂乡农民历来就有经营副业生产的习惯，副业收入在农民常年总收入中占相当大的比重。去年冬季建成高级社以后，由于社的领导上对生产缺乏全面观点，使不少副业停顿了。据社内刘保屯、东树林子二个自然屯的三十八户社员调查，1954年养羊74只，目前仅有30只。1954年养母猪十二头，1955年则为五头，1956年剩下四头。由于母猪减少，繁殖量下降，肥猪出售量就一年少于一年。1954年出卖肥猪四十一口，1955年出卖四十口，而今年只卖出十一口。
    副业下降使社员的收入也显著减少了。如原团结社，1954年每户平均副业收入七十四元，1956年预计每户的副业收入至多三十四元。合作社集体经营的副业也同样被忽视了。如原“五二”社1954年的副业收入占当年农业收入的13.5％，而今年（未规划前）计划的副业收入，仅占农业收入的0.27％。总之，不论是社员家庭副业和社的集体副业，都处在衰落的局面。
    副业为什么减少
    为什么发生这种现象呢？根据这个乡的情况看，原因有三：首先是社干部对这样社会主义集体大生产缺乏经验，生产管理上顾此失彼，顾头不顾脚，只看到了农业生产的重要（这是对的），看不到副业生产对增加社员收入和支持农业生产的重要作用。如有人认为：“搞副业是扔大头抓小头”，有的认为：“多摆一个摊子多操一股心，不如摸着一门干”。特别是对“勤俭办社”方针，有片面理解，只认识到处处少开支就是勤俭，对如何积极开辟生产门路，增加资金来源却认识不足。其次，对社员家庭副业不仅没有进行具体组织和支持，甚至限制社员活动。社员们不知道自己养的牛、羊所需的饲料（一般都是用花生秸子、地瓜秧子）秋后社里是否供给，也不知道经营副业抽出一些工来社里是否允许，因此，对发展副业生产没有信心。有些社对社员的活动限制过严，堵塞了小宗副业门路。如第十八生产队，在备耕空隙时，崔国臣等几名社员为了解决生活困难，出外挑了几次土盐卖，队里就批评他们有“资本主义思想”。社员反映：“高级社好是好，没有零钱花，困的受不了”。第三、合作化高潮中，政策宣传不全面，经营副业生产的农民对政策不托底，怕牛群、羊群、猪群都归公，因而有的盲目出卖，不愿继续经营。
        算三笔账
    副业的停顿严重影响了社员生活，也逐渐引起了社管理委员会的注意，最近在上级工作组的帮助下，根据各方面的条件，制定了副业生产规划。规划的方法是：
    先算细账，找损失、提高思想认识。全社算了三笔账。第一笔账使大家认识到，由于社内忽略了副业生产，大大减少了经济来源，不仅影响社员日常生活，同时也影响了社内生产投资。如社内按需要尚缺六十头牲畜，由于资金所限没法添齐，结果春耕中有的队违误了农时，夏锄中全面实现三铲三趟也没保证。第二笔账使大家认识到，由于社员家庭付业的削弱，使今年每户社员的实际收入，平均比1955年减少十六元，全社1，215户共少收入19，440元，这个数以农业来弥补，需要九十垧地的收成。即使今年社内农业能增产九百石粮，而社员的收入还不能有所增加。第三笔账使大家认识到，由于各项副业生产量的下降，不仅影响了合作社和社员的收入，对城乡人民需要，以及国家建设都是不利的。以生猪一项来说，1954年全社这1，215户人家卖出猪肉214，100斤，而今年仅能卖出11，064斤，这自然会影响到国家对猪肉的需要。生产门路原来是很多的
    在提高认识的基础上，大家发展副业生产的劲头十分高涨。接着就根据当地实际条件，研究了副业生产发展的方向。社内计划由今年到明年要迅速恢复和发展饲养业（包括牛、羊、猪、鸡等）、窑业、运输业、粉坊、豆腐坊，编织业以及铁、木、皮、柳等多种副业生产，并根据各项副业生产的性质和特点，确定窑业、饲养业、作坊为常年性的副业生产，其余如运输、编织、铁、木、柳等项为季节性的副业，农忙即可停止。这些副业生产有些是满足社内生产和基本建设的需要，有些产品是出卖，一般都有一定的用途和销路。
    规划中按照公私兼顾的原则，对合作社经营和社员经营又作了适当分工。比较大宗、社员个人经营不便的副业项目，如运输、窑业、铁、木、皮、柳等都由社内统一经营。其它如编织、饲养由社和社员共同经营。有些则归社员个人经营社内支持。此外社内还确定社员在农闲时，经社许可，可外出搞一些体力运输和卖小工夫等，以增加个人收入。
    这些副业生产的发展，是按照有原料、销路广、有经营能力等条件确定的。首先着重生猪生产的发展，计划由目前开始，今明两年社内母猪由现在的130口发展到230口（其中社内经营100口，社员经营130口），以增加小猪繁殖量，供给社员养猪需要，要求明年每户社员平均饲养二口猪。肥猪出售量由今年的790口，增加到1，500口。猪的饲料问题，经研究用种南瓜、粉房浆渣、采集野草等办法解决，再加上社员各家的糠皮等完全够用。根据当地牧场不足的情况，确定牛、羊基本保持在现有饲养水平。至于社员自己经营少量的牛、羊，社内要尽可能分给必须的饲料。其他窑业、作坊等也作了适当安排。
    生产做了规划后，就统一规划劳动力，保证农业、副业用工需要，防止可能发生的矛盾。根据社员实报工数，除完成社内的农、副业生产外，还可以余出七千多个机动工。只要组织好劳动力，在搞好农业生产的情况下，副业生产计划是有把握实现的。	  社员收入开始增加了
    规划制定以后，在群众中进行了广泛的宣传，对目前可以动手的副业马上动手兴办。这种转变很快见到成效。社员对合作社的信赖和劳动热情大大提高了。根据这个规划，全社全年副业收入可增加177，150元（包括合作社集体副业和社员家庭副业）。这笔收入相当于社内农业收入的22.1％，副业计划实现后，每户社员的平均收入，将比原计划收入增加32.8％。今年下半年，社员就可以有42，100元的副业收入分到手里，每户可比未发展副业以前多分35元左右。
    规划之后生产门路多了，劳动力的利用率也大大提高了。过去被认为无处投放的劳动力被充分利用起来了，老弱劳力也有了广阔的出路。总计全社的劳力利用率比以前提高38.8％。
    副业生产的开展，也支持和促进了农业生产的发展。畜牧和家禽饲养业的发展，给社内增加了肥料。仅养猪养羊全年即可为合作社积起能上850垧地的质量较好的粪肥。
    为了实现上述的副业生产计划，社内确定了专门领导副业生产的负责人，现在，社内集体的养猪场基本建成，砖窑已经和用户签订了七万块砖的合同，现在已经开窑点火，夏锄中还抽出去60个劳力，去盘山农场开荒，现在全社副业已经收入四千元左右了。
