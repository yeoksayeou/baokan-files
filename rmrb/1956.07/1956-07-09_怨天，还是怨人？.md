	Blame Heaven, or Blame People?
	I am an ordinary soldier of the People's Liberation Army. Our station – Yangtuosi Township, Anyi County, Shanxi – had exceptionally good wheat growth this year; but because the local leading organs and agricultural cooperative leaders were careless and negligent, the wheat that was about to be harvested suffered huge losses.
	The situation was as follows: not long ago, the wheat was already golden. The Central Meteorological Observatory issued a gale and rain forecast; however, the local leading organs and agricultural cooperative did not immediately organize farmers to rush the harvest. Our troops’ leadership, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately mobilized all officers and soldiers to get up at 3:30 in the morning to help the agricultural cooperative harvest wheat. However, people in the agricultural cooperative were very calm. The cooperative cadres said, "Don't panic." Therefore, although with the assistance of our unit, the wheat was cut down, it was not able to be transported home (originally, if the rush harvest had been organized in a planned manner, it could have been completely collected and brought home). The cut wheat lying in the field, after several days of heavy rain, grew green sprouts three or four centimeters long. It is estimated that the entire township will lose more than 200,000 catties of wheat. What an alarming loss! Our officers and soldiers were very saddened to see this situation. When we went to help the cooperative dry the wheat, everyone said with emotion: "Is this a natural disaster, or a man-made disaster?" Some comrades also said: "This is increased production without harvest." I hope you will publish this letter to arouse vigilance in other places regarding such matters.

### 怨天，还是怨人？

    怨天，还是怨人？
    我是人民解放军的一个普通军人。我们的驻地——山西安邑县羊驮寺乡，今年麦子长的真好；只因为当地领导机关和农业社领导人员麻痹大意，使眼看收到家的麦子遭到了巨大的损失。
    事情是这样的：不久前的一天，麦子已经金黄色了，中央气象台发布了大风雨预告消息；但当地领导机关和农业社却没有立即组织农民抢收。我们部队领导上看到情况不好，立即动员了全体官兵，早晨三点半钟起床，帮助农业社抢收小麦。可是，农业社里的人很沉得住气。社干部说：“不要惊慌。”因此，虽然在我部的协助下，把麦子割下来了，但是却没有能够运回家里（本来如果有计划地组织抢收，是完全可以收到家里去的）。割倒的麦子躺在地里，经过几天的大雨，长出了三、四公分长的绿芽。据估计全乡将损失麦子二十余万斤。这是多么惊人的损失啊！我们官兵看到这种情况，都很痛心。当我们又去帮助社里晒麦子的时候，大家都感慨地说：“这算天灾，还是人祸呢？”也有的同志说：“这是增产不收。”希望你们把这封信登载出来，引起其它地方对这类事情的警惕。
