    Suggestions for Improving the Double-Wheeled Double-Share Plow

    More and more farmers are buying double-wheeled double-share plows. However, some users still have opinions about the construction of the double-wheeled double-share plow, which affects sales. The general reflection is that the plow itself is too heavy, and it is very difficult for the livestock to pull it, which is not suitable for the current general primary cooperatives. According to my understanding, this product is too heavy, and the wheel axle is sluggish. Therefore, I suggest: 1. Try to improve the quality of the raw materials of the plow body to reduce the weight. 2. Install beads on the wheel axle (similar to the installation method of beads on bicycle axles), and use the sliding force of the beads to reduce the weight. I hope that the relevant departments will study whether the above two points are appropriate.

    建议改进双轮双铧犁
    农民群众购买双轮双铧犁的更多了。但是，对双轮双铧犁的构造，有部分用户还有意见，因此影响了销售。一般的反映是犁的本身太重，牲口拉着很吃力，不适宜于目前一般初级社使用。据我了解，这种产品太重，而且轮轴滞塞。因此，我建议：1、尽量提高犁身的原料质量，以减轻重量。2、在轮轴上安装珠子（好像自行车轴上的珠子的安装法），利用珠子的滑动力来减轻重量。以上两点是否适宜，希望有关部门研究。
