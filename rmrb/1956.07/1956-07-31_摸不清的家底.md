    "Unfathomable Inventory"
    Lu Cun
    The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has an interesting table. This table is a statistic of the inventory tonnage of rebar (steel bars under 8mm) of six engineering companies under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau for July. The table is as follows:
    This table shows that all six engineering companies underreported their inventory. The third and sixth companies reported none at all. The total inventory reported by the six companies was more than 330 tons less than the actual inventory. In addition, many companies requested even more when preparing their needs plans. As a result, the balance showed that the rebar needs and inventory for key projects in July differed by more than 500 tons. As a result, the situation became tense, and the material balance conference convened by the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau at the end of June failed to resolve the problem. After the meeting, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau sent people down to inspect, verified the inventory, and checked the required quantities. As a result, the difference of more than 500 tons disappeared, and the inventory alone was sufficient to meet the needs of key projects in July with a surplus.
    Unfortunately, this kind of unpleasant thing also exists in many other places. For example, in May, the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau reported to the leadership that it would be short of more than 1,600 tons of cement in June. Later, the North China Engineering Management Bureau sent people down to inspect and found that the cement inventory of this engineering bureau was more than 3,000 tons more than the reported figure. In fact, there was not only no shortage, but also a surplus.
    These facts provide evidence that the current situation of tight supply of steel, cement, and other materials is partly "fabricated" by the materials-using departments.
    What are the disadvantages of this "fabricated" atmosphere of tension? The disadvantages are obvious. If the state allocates materials according to the inventory reported by these units, it will inevitably lead to the accumulation of many materials and affect the needs of units that urgently need materials. If these units are not trusted and people have to be sent to inspect and verify, it will also cause a waste of manpower and materials, and this is not a normal solution.
    In order to avoid this artificial tension, materials-using units should naturally be asked to accurately report their inventory.
    Is it that these units have no way to figure out their own inventories? We cannot say that. Because materials-using units generally have relatively sound systems in materials management, they are fully capable of clarifying their inventory situation. In fact, the staff sent by the higher authorities can find out the inventory, so why can't the units themselves figure out their own inventories?
    So, where is the root cause? Some responsible comrades in the materials departments said: This is mainly because departmentalism is at play. Some units, hearing that the supply of materials is tight, consciously "keep a reserve" and "lay an ambush". It seems that this statement is very reasonable.
    How to solve this problem? Some leaders of materials departments have summarized an experience, that is, to "check the needs and check the inventory" regularly, aiming at the situation of "reporting less needs and reporting more inventory". This method has indeed achieved some results. However, this is not a fundamental solution. To fundamentally solve this problem, materials-using units need to seriously criticize and overcome departmentalism and truthfully report their inventory. Implementing this method is beneficial to the country and also more honorable for the materials-using units themselves.

    “摸不清的家底”
    路村
    建筑工程部材料总局有一份有趣的表格。这份表格是统计西北工程管理总局所属六个工程公司七月份盘元（八公厘以下的钢筋）库存吨数的。表如下：
    这份表格表明：这六个工程公司都少报了库存数量，第三、第六两个公司甚至一点也没有报，六个公司自报的库存数量比实际库存数量共少了三百三十多吨；加以不少公司在编制需要计划的时候又多要了一些，结果平衡起来，七月份重点工程的盘元需要量和库存量相差五百多吨。这样一来，情况就紧张起来了，六月底西北工程管理总局召开的材料平衡会议上，无法解决这个问题。会后，西北工程管理总局派人下去检查，查实了库存，核实了需要数量，结果这个五百多吨的差额没有了，仅库存数量就足以满足七月份重点工程的需要还有富裕。
    不幸得很，这种不愉快的事情其他许多地方也有。例如，华北太原工程局五月间曾向领导方面提出，六月份缺少水泥一千六百多吨；后来，华北工程管理总局派人下去检查，发现这个工程局的水泥库存数量比自报数字多三千多吨，实际上不但不缺，还有剩余。
    这些事实提供了一个证据，证明目前钢材、水泥等部分材料供应紧张的情况，有一部分是由使用材料部门“加工制造”的。
    这种“加工制造”的紧张气氛有什么害处呢？害处是很明显的。如果国家按照这些单位自报的库存情况来调拨材料，必然会使许多材料形成积压，影响急需材料单位的需要。如果不相信这些单位，都要派人去检查核对，也将会造成人力、物力的浪费，而且这也不是正常的办法。
    为了避免这种人为的紧张，自然应该请使用材料单位自己准确地报告库存数量。
    是不是这些单位就没有办法摸清自己的家底呢？不能这样说。因为各使用材料单位在材料管理方面一般都已经有了比较健全的制度，完全有条件把库存情况弄清楚；事实上，上级派去的工作人员就能查清库存，为什么本单位反而摸不清自己的家底呢？
    那末，究竟原因在哪里？有些材料部门的负责同志说：这主要是因为本位主义思想作祟，有些单位听说材料供应紧张，就有意识地
  “留后手”、“打埋伏”。看来，这种说法是大有道理的。
    这个问题怎么解决呢？有些材料部门的领导人员总结出了一条经验，这就是要针对着“需要计划以少报多，库存数量以多报少”的情况，经常到下面“查需要，查库存”。这种办法的确也收到了一些效果。但是，这终究不是治本的办法。要根本解决这个问题，需要各使用材料单位认真批判和克服本位主义思想，如实地来报告自己的库存情况。实行这种办法，对国家有利，对使用材料单位本身也比较光彩。
