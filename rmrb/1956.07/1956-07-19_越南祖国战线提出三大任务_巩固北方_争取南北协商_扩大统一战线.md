Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th. The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front began an enlarged meeting today to review the situation of the struggle for national reunification in the past two years, summarize the work of the Fatherland Front in the first half of the year, and determine the tasks for the second half of this year.

Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, said in his report this morning that the three main tasks of the Vietnamese people and the Vietnam Fatherland Front in the second half of this year are: First, to continue to consolidate the North, successfully complete the national plan, and do a good job in reviewing land reform. In areas where land reform has not been carried out, it is necessary to improve the people's lives and stabilize social order; second, to continue the struggle for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, demanding that the Southern regime and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hold consultative conferences to discuss the issue of unifying the country through general elections, and to promote the restoration of normal relations between the North and South and the establishment of various connections between the two regions; third, to consolidate and expand the national united front, support and assist the expansion of various people's organizations within the united front, and form some new organizations.

Ton Duc Thang said that the nationwide struggle to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords to achieve national reunification is a part of the Vietnamese people's national and democratic revolution, and it will definitely be victorious, but it is also long-term, arduous and complex.

At today's enlarged meeting, three reports were also heard on the current situation in South Vietnam, the situation of land reform in Vietnam, and the implementation of the national plan in the first half of this year. The meeting is scheduled to close on July 22.
