Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" Volume 1 Published

The first volume of Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" was published in late June.

This volume is translated based on Volume 17 of the German text "Hegel's Complete Works" re-published by Glockner in 1928, with reference to Haldane's English translation and Hofmeister's 1940 publication "Hegel's History of Philosophy" Volume 1, which was re-arranged based on original materials. In particular, materials on the history of Chinese philosophy were supplemented from the latter. Therefore, the Chinese translation is richer in content than the German Glockner first edition and the second English edition. This volume includes: "Introduction", "Oriental Philosophy" and the first part of "Greek Philosophy".

This "History of Philosophy" was highly praised by Marx, and Engels quoted it extensively in his works. Lenin also conducted in-depth research on it and made famous notes. Now, the first volume of the Chinese translation of this "History of Philosophy" has been presented to our readers for the first time, which deserves the attention and welcome of our philosophical circles.

    黑格尔“哲学史讲演录”第一卷出版
    黑格尔“哲学史讲演录”的第一卷已于六月下旬出版。
    这一卷是根据格洛克纳在1928年重新刊行的德文本“黑格尔全集”第十七卷译出，并参考了霍尔丹的英译本，荷夫麦斯特1940年出版的根据原始材料重新编排的“黑格尔哲学史”第一卷，特别从后者补充了关于我国哲学史的材料。因此，中译本比德文格洛克纳第一版本和第二版英译本内容更为丰富。这一卷内容有：“导言”，“东方哲学”和“希腊哲学”第一篇。
    这部“哲学史”曾得到马克思的很高的评价，恩格斯在他的著作中，从中作过不少引证，列宁对它也作过精深的研究，并作了有名的摘记。现在，这部“哲学史”的中译本的第一卷，已第一次贡献于我国读者之前，这是值得我国哲学界重视和欢迎的。
