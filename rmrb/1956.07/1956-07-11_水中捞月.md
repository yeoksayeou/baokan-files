	Trying to Catch the Moon in the Water
	Not long ago, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) established a "headquarters" in Bangkok, Thailand. The United States seized this opportunity to heavily promote SEATO. The U.S. military radio station, "Voice of the Armed Forces, Tokyo," immediately announced that with this "headquarters," "it is now possible to launch a campaign to absorb new member states." According to the radio station, the countries the United States hopes to "absorb" include Burma, Japan, Indonesia, as well as the Ngo Dinh Diem Group and the Syngman Rhee Group.
	At the same time, United Press reporter Holbrecht also reported the same "inside information." Holbrecht often uses the guise of reflecting the opinions of so-called "Asian figures" to create "public opinion" and test the waters for the United States. His advantage over "Voice of the Armed Forces, Tokyo" is that he painstakingly offered advice on how to "absorb" other countries into SEATO. According to him, the reason why SEATO is being coldly received in Asia is because the propaganda work has not been done well, that is, "the advantages of this organization have not been promoted," and too much "emphasis has been placed on the military nature of this organization." It is said that if "more emphasis" is placed on the "economic" aspects in the future, it may make certain neutral countries "reconsider." Holbrecht is still singing the old tune here: the "big stick policy" is not working, so we might as well try using checkbooks.
	However, this American strategist is a bit too naive. He thinks that today, Asian countries will measure SEATO based on American propaganda, rather than American actions. What "benefits" have Asian countries that joined this group actually received in terms of economy? There are many ready examples. The "Manila Chronicle" of the Philippines recently complained: "Our economic relations with the United States have reached an intolerable point. We no longer need to continue to believe that we should receive special treatment from the United States... We no longer need to try to catch the moon in the water."
	Indeed, for Asian countries that join SEATO to expect the United States to provide any benefits for their economic development is like trying to catch the moon in the water. But for propaganda machines like the Associated Press to use the so-called economic "advantages" of SEATO to lure other Asian countries into the trap, isn't it also like trying to catch the moon in the water?

    水中捞月
    东南亚条约集团不久以前在泰国的曼谷成立了一个“总部”，美国就抓住这个机会来给东南亚条约集团大做广告了。美国军方的广播电台“东京军中之声”马上说，有了这个“总部”，“现在有可能展开一个吸收新会员国的运动”。据这个电台透露，美国希望“吸收”的国家有缅甸、日本、印度尼西亚以及吴庭艳集团和李承晚集团。
    同一个时候，合众社记者霍布雷奇特也报道了同样的一条“内幕消息”。霍布雷奇特是经常打着反映所谓“亚洲人士”意见的招牌来替美国制造“舆论”、试探空气的。他比“东京军中之声”稍强一筹的地方，就在于他还煞费苦心地对怎样才能“吸收”其他国家参加东南亚条约集团作了一番献策。据他认为：东南亚条约集团之所以在亚洲受到冷遇，是因为宣传工作没做好，也就是“没有宣传这个组织的优点”，而太多地“强调这个组织的军事性质”。据说，今后如果“较多地强调经济”方面，也许就可以使某些中立国家“重新考虑一番”。霍布雷奇特这里唱的还是老调：“大棒政策”是行不通了，那就只好用支票本子试试看吧。
    可是，这位美国策士未免太天真了一点。他以为到了今天，亚洲国家还会根据美国的宣传，而不是根据美国的行事来衡量东南亚条约集团。参加这个集团的亚洲国家在经济方面究竟得到了些什么“好处”呢？现成的例子是很多的。菲律宾的“马尼拉纪事报”在最近就埋怨说：“我们同美国的经济关系已经达到了忍无可忍的地步。我们不必再继续相信我们应该得到美国的特惠待遇。……我们不必再水中捞月了。”
    的确，参加东南亚条约集团的亚洲国家要想美国能给它们的经济发展以什么好处，那是在水中捞月。可是合众社之流的宣传机器想用东南亚条约集团的这种所谓经济上的“优点”，来引诱其他亚洲国家上钩，又何尝不是在水中捞月。　　　　　　　　　（平）
