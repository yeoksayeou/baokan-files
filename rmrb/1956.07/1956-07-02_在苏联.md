	In the Soviet Union
	"Soviet Russia Newspaper" Launched
	The "Soviet Russia Newspaper" was published on July 1st. This four-page daily newspaper is the organ of the Russian Federation Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and various newspapers congratulated its publication. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that "'Soviet Russia Newspaper' can successfully undertake its duties if it relies on the active participation of a large number of worker-peasant correspondents in all its work, if it becomes a true forum for the masses, and if it becomes a weapon for carrying out brave and principled criticism."
	"Pravda" to Increase Supplements Three Times a Week
	Starting from July 1st, "Pravda" will publish six pages every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, increasing the coverage of culture and life.
	Opening of Jet Airliner Routes
	A "TU-104" airliner flew from Moscow to Boli Airport on June 30th. The aircraft flew at an altitude of 9,000 meters above the clouds and only took ten hours. Jet airliner routes will soon be opened between Moscow and Boli. With this kind of flight, a round trip can be made in one day and night.
	Newly Built Boarding Schools
	The Moscow City Soviet decided to open thirteen boarding schools in more than a dozen districts in this new school year. The school buildings in two districts are newly built, and the school buildings in other districts are using the original better buildings. Standard-designed boarding schools will be established in the vicinity of Moscow. The first floor of this type of building is a dining hall, kitchen, fitter and carpenter workshops; the second and third floors are dormitories; the fourth floor is classrooms; and the fifth floor is a conference hall, reading room, library, and extracurricular activity rooms for technical, literary, artistic, musical, and drama groups. Moscow's boarding schools will soon begin to receive students from the first to fifth grades. In the future, students from the sixth to tenth grades will be admitted. Enrolled children will be provided with room, board, clothing, and books and stationery. Experienced people will be selected as teachers, and advanced experience from kindergartens, Young Pioneer camps, and excellent schools will be adopted. Boarding schools will care about the physical and mental development of young citizens and will pay attention to promoting comprehensive technical education and developing children's artistic talents.

    一架“TY—104”式民航机在六月三十日从莫斯科飞到伯力飞机场。飞机航行在云层上面的九千公尺空中，只飞行了十个小时。在莫斯科和伯力之间很快要开辟喷气民航机的航线。乘这种班机，可以在一昼夜间打一个来回。
    新建的寄宿学校
    莫斯科市苏维埃决定在这个新学年中在十几个区开辟十三座寄宿学校。有两个区校舍是新盖的，其他各区校舍是利用原有的较好的建筑物。在莫斯科近郊将建立标准设计的寄宿学校。这种建筑物的一层是食堂，厨房，钳工木工等工作室；二三层是宿舍；四层是教室；五层是会议厅、阅览厅、图书馆、技术、文学、艺术、音乐、话剧等小组课外活动室。莫斯科的寄宿学校不久将开始接收一年级到五年级的学生。将来将增收六年级到十年级的学生。入学的儿童将供给以膳宿、衣着和书籍文具。将挑选有经验的人们当教员，将采用幼儿园、少先营和优秀学校的先进经验。寄宿学校将关心年青公民的身心的发育，将注意推行综合技术教育和发展儿童的艺术才能。
