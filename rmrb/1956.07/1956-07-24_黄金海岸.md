    Gold Coast
    The Gold Coast is located in West Africa, bordered by the French-administered Togo to the east, the Gulf of Guinea to the south, and French West Africa to the west and north. It comprises the Gold Coast Colony, Ashanti, and the Northern Territories. In addition, the British-administered Togo is also under its administration. The people of British-administered Togo held a plebiscite on May 9th this year, and the results showed that they favored merging with the Gold Coast.
    The Gold Coast has an area of 237,780 square kilometers and a population of 4,400,900, mainly Africans. The capital is Accra.
    The Gold Coast officially became a British colony in 1821. Before that, it was occupied by Portugal in 1482, then transferred to the Netherlands in the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of the land had been occupied by Britain.
    Although the Gold Coast now has an "autonomous" government, it is actually ruled by a British Governor, under whom there is a cabinet and a legislative assembly. The Governor holds the supreme power of the state and is responsible for foreign affairs, defense, and police affairs. There are four political parties: the ruling party is the People's Convention Party; the other parties are the Ghana Congress Party, the Northern People's Party, and the Togoland Congress. The current cabinet is composed of the People's Convention Party, and the Prime Minister is Nkrumah.
    The Gold Coast is a backward agricultural country, but it has considerable natural resources. Its main crop is cocoa, and its output ranks first in the world. Gold mining ranks second among African countries; manganese production ranks third in the world; and bauxite reserves are also extremely rich. In addition, it is rich in timber and diamonds. However, these riches of the Gold Coast people have become the source of huge profits for British monopoly capitalists. For example, in 1950, Britain shipped away gold worth £8,719,000, diamonds worth £1,837,000, and manganese worth £5,007,000 from the Gold Coast.
    British monopoly capitalists control the main plantations and mining industries of the Gold Coast and monopolize the country's domestic commerce and foreign trade. For example, the United Africa Company is the real master of the Gold Coast's economy. British commercial trusts do not need any investment at all; they can seize cocoa from the Gold Coast at low prices and sell it in the United States at twice the price of the place of origin. As with other African colonies, Britain relies on plundering the Gold Coast's materials and selling them at high prices on the world market to earn US dollars, so as to balance Britain's trade deficit and solve the dollar crisis in the sterling area.
    American monopoly capitalists are also very interested in the rich resources of the Gold Coast. Before World War II, American capital had already begun to invade, and after the war, the position of American capital was further strengthened. Manganese mines are controlled by the American capital "Minerals and Carbons Corporation," and rich bauxite resources have also been transferred to American control. In addition to British capital, American capital is also involved in diamond mining.
    The people of the Gold Coast have long been unwilling to endure the insatiable exploitation and plunder of the colonial rulers. They have long launched struggles against the oppression of British colonialists. After World War II, the scale of the workers' movement and the national liberation movement in the Gold Coast further expanded. In 1947, the United Gold Coast Convention was formed. In 1948, a boycott of European goods was launched. In February and March of that year, a huge resistance movement broke out in the capital, Accra, against colonial rule. In 1950, the working class of the Gold Coast held a three-day general strike to oppose the anti-democratic "constitutional" draft then being drawn up, and held a boycott of British goods and mass protest rallies and demonstrations throughout the country, forcing the British government to agree to implement "free elections" in the Gold Coast. Although the election method was undemocratic, the People's Convention Party, which was supported by the broad masses of the people at that time, overwhelmingly defeated the right-wing conservative forces supported by the British ruling group with an absolute majority of votes. Since then, the struggle of the people of the Gold Coast against the enslavement of British and American monopoly capital and for national independence has continued to grow stronger.
    Faced with this heroic struggle of the Gold Coast people, the British government was forced to make some concessions on the surface, adopting a policy of so-called "granting autonomy within the Commonwealth" to deceive and paralyze the Gold Coast people, in order to continue to maintain its rule in this country. For example, the "New Constitution" announced in the Gold Coast in 1954 stipulated that the Legislative Assembly should be entirely composed of Africans, and that an African cabinet should be established to manage internal affairs, presided over by an African Prime Minister. On the surface, it seemed that the local people had taken control of the government, but in reality, the British Governor still held great power, and more than half of the senior government officials were British. Thus, it is clear that the main institutions of the state machine are still controlled by Britain.
    Recently, amidst the rising demands of the Gold Coast people for independence and liberation, the British colonialists had to renegotiate the constitution with the Gold Coast government in April and May of this year, and expressed their willingness to announce the date of Gold Coast's independence.

### 黄金海岸

    黄金海岸
    黄金海岸位于非洲西部，东邻法国托管地多哥，南濒几内亚湾，西、北两面被法属西非洲环绕着。它的组成部分包括黄金海岸殖民地、阿散蒂和北部领土。另有英国的托管地多哥现在也属它管理。英国托管地多哥的人民今年五月九日举行公民投票，投票结果表明赞成同黄金海岸合并。
    黄金海岸面积二十三万七千七百八十平方公里，人口四百四十万零九千人，主要是非洲人。首府阿克拉。
    黄金海岸是在1821年正式沦为英国的殖民地的。在这以前，1482年曾为葡萄牙所侵占，十七世纪转入荷兰手中，到十八世纪，大部分的土地就已被英国占领。
    黄金海岸现在虽然有“自治”政府，但实际上由英国总督统治，下设内阁和立法议会。总督掌握着国家大权，负责对外、国防和警察事务。现有四个政党：执政党是人民大会党；其他政党是加纳大会党、北部人民党和多哥大会党。现任内阁由人民大会党组成，总理是恩克鲁玛。
    黄金海岸是一个落后的农业国家，但有相当丰富的自然资源。它的主要种植物可可，产量占世界第一位，黄金开采量占非洲国家中第二位；锰矿的产量占世界第三位；铁矾土的蕴藏量也极为丰富。此外，还盛产木材和钻石等。但黄金海岸人民的这些财富却成为英国垄断资本家巨额利润的来源。如在1950年，英国便从黄金海岸运走了价值八百七十一万九千英镑的黄金，价值一百八十三万七千英镑的钻石和价值五百万零七千英镑的锰。
    英国的垄断资本家控制着黄金海岸主要的种植园和采矿工业，并垄断了这个国家的国内商业和对外贸易。如联合非洲公司是黄金海岸经济的真正主宰。英国商业托辣斯根本不需要什么投资，用低价劫走黄金海岸的可可，运到美国后就可卖到比产地高一倍的价格。和对其他非洲殖民地一样，英国靠掠夺黄金海岸的物资以高价在世界市场上出售来换取美元，以平衡英国的收支逆差和解决英镑区的美元危机。
    对于黄金海岸的丰富资源，美国垄断资本家也是感到很大兴趣的。在第二次大战前，美国资本已开始侵入，战后美国资本的地位更形加强。锰矿为美国资本“矿化物与碳联合康采恩”所控制，丰富的铁矾土资源也转移到美国的控制之下。钻石采掘工作除英国资本外，美国亦有资本参加。
    黄金海岸人民，长久以来就不甘忍受殖民统治者的贪得无餍的剥削和掠夺，他们早已展开反对英国殖民者压迫的斗争，二次世界大战后，黄金海岸的工人运动和民族解放运动的规模更其扩大。1947年组成了黄金海岸统一会议。1948年曾掀起抵制欧洲货物运动。当年二月到三月在首府阿克拉爆发了巨大的反抗运动，反对殖民地统治。1950年黄金海岸的工人阶级为反对当时正在拟订的反民主的“宪法”草案，举行了三天总罢工，并在全国范围内举行抵制英国货运动及群众性的抗议集会和示威，迫使英国政府答应在黄金海岸实施“自由选举”。这一选举虽然办法是不民主的，但当时获得广大群众支持的人民大会党终以绝大多数的选票压倒了为英国统治集团支持的右派保守势力。从那以后，黄金海岸人民为反对英美垄断资本的奴役和争取民族独立的斗争继续不断增强。
    面对着黄金海岸人民这种英勇的斗争，英国政府被迫在表面上作了若干让步，采取了所谓“在英联邦内给予自治”的政策，来欺骗与麻痹黄金海岸人民，以继续维持它在这个国家的统治。如1954年在黄金海岸宣布的“新宪法”规定立法会议全部由非洲人组成，并设立非洲人的内阁管理内政事务，由非洲籍总理主持，从表面上看似乎当地人已经掌握了政权，但实际上英国总督仍然大权在握，而政府的高级官员中，英国人占据了一半以上。这样很明显，国家机器的主要机构仍然控制在英国手中。
    最近，英国殖民者在黄金海岸人民要求独立和解放运动日益高涨声中，今年四、五月间不得不重新和黄金海岸政府举行关于修改宪法的谈判，并表示准备宣布黄金海岸独立的日期。　（周修庆）
