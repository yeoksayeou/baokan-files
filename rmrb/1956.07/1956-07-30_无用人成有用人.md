    Wang Wenzhang, a member of the Huangjing Agricultural Cooperative in Taoyuan County, Hunan, was a blind man who could not see. Before joining the cooperative, he couldn't do anything. Even walking required his father to lead him. His father and mother were both over sixty years old. The whole family only had mouths to feed and no one to work, so their life was extremely difficult, and their fields were left uncultivated. In February of this year, after Wang Wenzhang's family joined the cooperative, the cooperative assigned his father and son to the rice milling and processing team to process rice for the grain station. Wang Wenzhang was responsible for pushing the grain, and his father was in charge of milling and sifting. In two months, Wang Wenzhang and his father earned 950 work points and were pre-distributed ninety jin of wheat. According to their own plan, they can earn more than two thousand points after the autumn harvest. Based on the cooperative's planned value of 1.3 yuan per work day, they can receive 260 yuan.
    Because Wang Wenzhang actively participated in the cooperative's labor, he was honorably elected as a model during the cooperative's model selection. Wang Wenzhang became even more enthusiastic in his work. Wang Futang, a member of the cooperative committee, said: "After joining the advanced cooperative, a useless person has become a useful person." (Taoyuan Daily)

    无用人成有用人
    湖南桃源县黄荆农业社社员王文章，是个双目失明的瞎子。在入社以前，什么事也不能做，就连走路还得父亲牵着。而他的父亲、母亲，又都是六十多岁的人了。全家只有人吃饭，没有人劳动，生活极为困难，田地也荒得不像样子。今年二月，王文章全家入社后，社里分配他父子俩到碾米加工组，代粮管站加工大米。王文章专门推谷，他的父亲车米、筛米。两个月，王文章父子就得工分950分，预分麦子九十斤。按他们自己订的计划，到秋收后可做到二千分以上，每个劳动日以社计划的1.3元计算，可以分到二百六十元。
    由于王文章积极参加社的劳动，社里评选模范时，他光荣当选。王文章工作更加积极起来了。社委王富堂说：“入了高级社，无用人变成了有用人。”　（桃源报）
