    The Story of the Goose
    Hujiao
    The love of young men and women needs guidance, but not prevention, nor can it be prevented. Some school administrations have a headache over this issue, insisting on interfering and preventing it. They say: Love will hinder study, a very convincing reason. The motivation may not be bad, and in some young people, there are indeed cases where love hinders study and work, which needs attention. However, the methods taken by some schools are completely wrong.
    One way of preventing it is to spread absurd public opinion: saying that love is chaotic male-female relationships, is immoral behavior, causing students to have fear and be afraid of even mentioning it. A female student in a certain school received a love letter from a male student, so scared that she turned pale and cried for several days, and finally decided to "confess" to the organization and "explain the problem," saying that she had absolutely no such "bad thoughts."
    The second way to prevent it is to build barbed wire fences so that the "great defense" between men and women will not be broken. Some girls' middle schools do not allow seeing boyfriends, nor allow communicating with boyfriends. If there is any matter of falling in love, they will be criticized, struggled against, and even punished. Male students of a certain municipal middle school wanted to organize a choir, which was difficult without female voices, and wanted to cooperate with a certain girls' middle school, but were blocked by the girls' middle school administration, supposedly because it was inevitable that "bad things" would happen when male and female students got together.
    The essence of these ideas is self-evident. What surprises us is why this kind of thinking is still popular in some schools today?
    Giovanni Boccaccio, a humanist of the Italian Renaissance, wrote a story in the "Decameron":
    A devout religious man had a son, whom he loved very much and wanted to cultivate to inherit his mantle. Therefore, he placed him in an environment isolated from the world and gave him the strictest ascetic education from an early age. The child grew to be eighteen years old, and knew nothing about secular matters except for scriptures and prayers. Once, the father took him out to visit friends, walking outside the forbidden circle, and everything was new to the son. In particular, encountering a group of young women returning from a wedding made him even more pleasantly surprised, although he had never been close to a woman. He asked his father, "What is this?" The father, fearing to arouse his evil thoughts, replied, "This is a flock of geese." The son said, "Let me take one back!" The father hurriedly replied, "Geese are evil things, you can't take them." The son said, "I don't know what's evil about geese! I think they are much more beautiful than the beautiful angels you always tell me about!"
    The father sighed deeply, admitting that the power of nature could not be overcome, and admitting that his education method had completely failed.
    An educational method that had already proven to be a failure in a foreign country in the fourteenth century, I don't know why it is still being obsessed over by some people in the new China that has stepped onto the path of building socialism in the twentieth century?

    鹅的故事
    胡椒
    青年男女的恋爱是需要指导的，但不需要阻止，也不能阻止。有些学校的行政当局对于这件事很头痛，硬要加以干涉和阻止。他们说：恋爱会妨碍学习呀，理由叮当响。动机也许不坏，在有些青年中，也确有恋爱妨碍学习和工作的现象存在，需要注意。然而有些学校所采取的办法却是完全不对的。
    阻止的办法之一是散播荒谬的舆论：说恋爱就是男女关系混乱，是不道德的行为，使学生产生恐惧心理，谈虎色变。某校一女生收到一封男生求爱的信，吓得面如土色，哭了几天，最后决心向组织“坦白”，“交代问题”，说她决没有这样的“坏思想”。
    阻止的办法之二是建筑铁丝网，使男女之“大防”不被冲破。有的女子中学不许接见男朋友，不许同男朋友通信。倘有谈恋爱之事，便要受批评、斗争、以至处分。某市立中学的男同学想组织合唱团，没有女声是困难的，想同某女中合作，横遭女中行政当局阻止，据说是男女同学搞在一起难免不出“坏事情”。
    这些思想的本质是什么，不问自明。使我们吃惊的是这种思想到今天为什么还在一些学校流行？
    意大利文艺复兴时代的人文主义者薄伽丘写的“十日谈”中有一则故事：
    一个虔诚的宗教徒有一个儿子，他很爱他，想培养起来继承衣钵。因此将他放在一个隔绝尘寰的环境中，从小就对他施行最严格的清心寡欲的教育。孩子成长到十八岁，除了经文、祈祷之外，对世俗的一切毫无所知。一次，父亲带他出外去访朋友，走出了禁圈之外，对于儿子样样都新奇。特别是遇到一群参加婚礼归来的年轻妇女，使他更加惊喜不置，虽然他从来没有接近过女人。他问他父亲说：“这是什么？”父亲怕引动他的邪念，便回答：“这是一群鹅。”儿子说：“让我带一只回去吧！”父亲忙又答道：“鹅是邪恶的东西，带不得的。”儿子说：“我不知道鹅有什么邪恶！我看比你常向我讲的美丽的天使要更美丽得多啊！”
    父亲深深叹了一口气，承认自然的力量是不能战胜的，自认他的教育方法完全失败。
    十四世纪在外国已经证明失败了的教育方法，不知道为什么在二十世纪已迈上了建设社会主义道路的新中国仍然有人对它迷醉？
