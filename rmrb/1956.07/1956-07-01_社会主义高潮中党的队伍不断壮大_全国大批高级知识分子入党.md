On May 19th of this year, their wish was realized simultaneously. After joining the Party, they encouraged each other to strive to be outstanding Party members.

    社会主义高潮中党的队伍不断壮大
    全国大批高级知识分子入党
    新华社30日讯　从今年年初到“七一”前夕，各地有大批优秀的知识分子加入中国共产党。
    在北京和上海，近几个月来有三百多个高级知识分子入党。十六名从内地去支援新疆建设的高级知识分子不久以前先后入党。在内蒙古自治区，已经有二十三名蒙古、达呼尔和汉族的优秀知识分子被吸收入党。
    这些新入党的优秀知识分子中，有六十三岁的著名植物病理学家戴芳澜，著名古脊椎动物学家杨钟健，内分泌学家朱宪彝，小麦良种“碧玛一号”的培育者、西北农学院教授赵洪璋，著名翻译家曹靖华，著名电影导演蔡楚生、张骏祥，北京市著名中医赵锡武等许多科学家、工程师、教授、医师和文艺界人士。留英学生、中国科学院生理生化研究所副研究员曹天钦和他的夫人、复旦大学固体物理教研组主任谢希德，在1952年回到祖国以后，就以争取入党作为共同奋斗目标。今年五月十九日，他俩的这个愿望同时实现了。他俩入党以后，又以争取作优秀党员来互相勉励。
    许多高级知识分子在入党后表示，中国共产党给他们以新的生命力。老科学家戴芳澜入党以后，注意克服过去接近群众不够的缺点，经常深入基层单位了解工作情况。电影导演张骏祥入党以后正积极创作一部以高级知识分子思想转变为主题的电影文学剧本。
