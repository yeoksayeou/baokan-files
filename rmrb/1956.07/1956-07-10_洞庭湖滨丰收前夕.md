Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The rural areas around Dongting Lake in the hot month of July present a joyous and busy scene on the eve of the early rice harvest.

On the lake, white sails dot the water, and large and small boats transporting summer harvesting tools and fertilizers come and go in an endless stream. Passenger ships on all lines in the lake area are also busy, with a large number of passengers being agricultural cooperative rice threshing machine operators who have just returned to their hometowns from county-level harvesting technique training, and farmers from the hilly and mountainous areas coming to the lake area to support the summer harvest. In the past week, 100,000 farmers will have come to the lake area from the nearby hilly and mountainous areas to support the agricultural cooperatives in the lake area in harvesting early rice. Many agricultural cooperatives in the lake area have erected "welcome gates" on the main roads to greet these guests.

    洞庭湖滨丰收前夕
    据新华社讯　盛夏七月的洞庭湖滨农村，到处呈现一片早稻丰收前夕的欢乐繁忙景象。
    湖面上白帆点点，赶运夏收农具和肥料的大小船只络绎不绝。湖区各线客轮也很忙，大批的旅客是刚从县里学习收割技术回乡的农业社的打稻机手，是丘陵山区来湖区支援夏收的农民。最近一周内，将有十万农民从湖滨附近各丘陵山区来到湖区，支援湖区农业社收早稻。湖区许多农业社在大路上搭起“欢迎门”迎接这些客人。
