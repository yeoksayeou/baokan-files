Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 4th July – The Burmese government announced on July 3rd that it would continue to pursue an independent, neutral foreign policy.

A government statement issued by Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe at a press conference said, "Time and experience have proven the value and wisdom of the independent and neutral stance that has consistently served as the basis of the Union of Burma's foreign policy."

"In adhering to this policy, we will be extremely honest in our dealings with the peoples of all countries. Whether they will be so towards us is something we can only leave to them to decide."

The statement said that in a world where coexistence has become indispensable, the goal of establishing friendly relations with all countries has proven to be a realistic policy.

The Burmese government will continue to implement this policy without any change, and it will continue to work towards achieving lasting peace and dissolving all blocs.

Referring to domestic issues, the statement said that the government's most important and urgent task is to restore law and order within the country. To this end, the government will strengthen the effectiveness of the police and the Federal Military Police, expand the army, and strengthen the activities of the People’s Militia.

The Burmese government's statement mentioned Burma's national prosperity plan formulated in 1952, and said that due to factors such as the decline in rice prices, reduced foreign exchange earnings, and the activities of anti-government forces, the plan's targets could not be achieved as scheduled.

The Burmese government will re-examine and adjust the development plan. The government will make a realistic assessment of its resources and calculate the level of investment that can be achieved.

"The government will continuously strive to increase agricultural, timber, and mining production in order to increase the country's exports." The statement emphasized that resolute measures will be taken to suppress prices. Malpractices such as hoarding and selling licenses will be stopped.

In answering questions, U Ba Swe said that if US aid does not come with conditions, the Burmese government would consider such aid. He said, "As everyone knows, we are willing to accept aid from any country, as long as such aid does not conflict with our independent and neutral foreign policy."

    缅甸总理重申中立政策
    缅甸政府将继续为实现持久和平而努力
    新华社仰光4日电　缅甸政府七月三日宣布，它将继续奉行独立的中立的外交政策。
    由缅甸总理吴巴瑞在记者招待会上发表的一项政府声明说，“时间和经验已经证明了一直作为缅甸联邦外交政策基础的独立的中立立场的价值和明智。”
    “在遵守这种政策的时候，我们在同各国人民的交往中将极其老实。他们是否也会对我们这样是我们只能留待他们自己去决定的事。”
    声明说，在共处已经成为必不可避免的世界里，同一切国家建立友好关系的目标已经证明是一个现实的政策。
    缅甸政府将继续执行这个政策不作任何改变，它将为争取实现持久和平和解散一切集团而继续努力。
    在谈到国内问题的时候，声明说，政府的最重要最迫切的任务是恢复国内的法律和秩序。声明说，为此，政府将加强警察和联邦军事警察的效力，扩建陆军和加强民卫队的活动。
    缅甸政府的声明谈到了缅甸1952年制订的国家繁荣计划，并且说，由于大米价格下跌，外汇收入减少，以及反政府军队的活动等因素，这个计划的指标无法如期达到。
    缅甸政府将重新审查和调整发展计划。政府将对它的资源进行实事求是的估计，并且计算可能达到的投资的水平。
    “政府将不断努力增加农业、木材和矿业生产，以便增加国家的出口。”声明着重指出，将采取坚决措施压抵物价。像囤积居奇和出卖执照等不良风气将予制止。
    吴巴瑞在回答问题的时候说，美援如果不附带条件，缅甸政府将考虑这种援助。他说，“大家知道，我们愿意接受任何国家的援助，只要这种援助同我们的独立的中立外交政策不发生抵触。”
