Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 21st: Indian Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan, in expressing his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union, said that the various nationalities of the Soviet Union are hardworking, friendly, amiable, and eager to learn. They are proud of their country and full of confidence in its future. They sincerely love peace.

Radhakrishnan said that the differences between the two major power blocs have created an atmosphere of suspicion, fear, and hatred throughout the world. He also said, "If we are to look at the current situation with a reasonable perspective, then we must overcome our emotions and pay attention to the rethinking and actions currently being carried out within the Soviet Union. We should abandon our emotional hatred and our rigid attitudes."

He particularly mentioned the significant material progress made by the Soviet Union's Asian republics. He said that these places have been completely transformed in the last thirty years, and any unbiased visitor would be deeply impressed by this.

Radhakrishnan praised the racial harmony within the Soviet Union. He said that in the Soviet Union, different races live in harmony, and everyone feels like a member of one big family. He contrasted this situation with the racial discrimination practiced in some countries. He said that "even in advanced democratic countries" there is racial superiority, segregation, and discrimination based on skin color.

    印度副总统谈访苏观感
    苏联人真诚地爱和平，对前途满怀信心
    新华社新德里21日电　印度副总统拉德哈克里希南博士在发表他访问苏联的观感的时候说，苏联各族人民都是勤劳、友好、和蔼并且是好学不倦的。他们为自己的国家感到自豪，并且对它的前途满怀信心。他们真诚地爱好和平。
    拉德哈克里希南说，两个大国集团之间的分歧已经在全世界造成了猜疑、恐惧和仇恨的气氛。他又说，“如果我们要以合乎情理的看法来看目前的形势，那么我们就必须克服自己的感情，注意目前苏联国内所进行的重新思考和行动。应该抛弃我们的感情用事的仇恨和我们的僵硬不变的态度。”
    他特别谈到了苏联亚洲部分的各加盟共和国在物质方面所取得的重大进展。他说，这些地方在近三十年以来已经面目全非了，任何不抱有偏见的访问者都会对此获得很深刻的印象。
    拉德哈克里希南称赞苏联国内种族和谐。他说，在苏联，不同的种族和睦相处，大家都感觉自己是一个大家庭的成员。他把这种情况同某些国家所实行的种族歧视进行了对比。他说，“甚至在先进的民主国家”也存在着种族优越感、种族隔离和肤色歧视的。
