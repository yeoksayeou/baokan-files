Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 13th (dispatch from Bonn): U.S. Ambassador to West Germany, Conant, recently formally expressed regret to West German authorities for the increasing number of atrocities committed by U.S. troops stationed in West Germany. In a letter to the West German Foreign Minister, he stated that the U.S. military authorities are taking all steps to "ensure" "good relations" between the U.S. occupying forces and the German people.

Conant took this measure in response to the rising anti-American sentiment among the West German people, which was fueled by the misdeeds of the U.S. forces stationed in West Germany. In recent times, West German newspapers have been reporting more and more on the atrocities committed by U.S. troops, and the calls for protesting these atrocities have grown louder and louder.

Throughout West Germany and West Berlin, according to a recent announcement by West German Interior Minister Schröder, a total of 3,194 German women have given birth to children as a result of being raped by soldiers of the occupying forces.

On July 12th, the Bamberg City Council in Bavaria passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the city. The members of the City Council passed this resolution after hearing a report about the rape of a fifteen-year-old West German girl by seven U.S. soldiers. Two other similar incidents have recently occurred in Bavaria.

Not long ago, an incident occurred in Munich where U.S. soldiers threw a hand grenade into a dance hall, injuring seventeen people. This incident aroused strong protests from members of the Bavarian State Parliament.

The Associated Press pointed out that "German protests against the misconduct of Allied soldiers have reached a new peak." Recently, U.S. military officers stationed in West Germany have been constantly receiving letters demanding that they go home, saying: "The German nation's patience has reached its limit, go home, it's not too late now."

### 西德人民对美军暴行忍无可忍  抗议呼声达到新的高峰

    西德人民对美军暴行忍无可忍
    抗议呼声达到新的高峰
    新华社柏林13日电　波恩消息：美国驻西德大使康南特最近为驻西德美军日益众多的暴行向西德当局正式表示遗憾。他在写给西德外交部长的信里说，美国军事当局正在采取一切步骤，“保证”美国占领军同德国人“关系良好”。
    康南特是在西德美国驻军的胡作非为促使西德人民反美情绪高涨的情况下采取这个措施的。最近一个时期以来，西德报纸上关于美军暴行的报道越来越多，抗议暴行的呼声也越来越响亮。
    在整个西德和西柏林，据西德内政部长施罗德最近宣布，因为被占领军士兵强奸而生了小孩的德国妇女，到现在为止一共有三千一百九十四人。
    七月十二日，巴伐利亚州班贝克市政委员会通过了一个决议，要求美军撤出这个城市。市政委员会的委员们是在听取了一件关于七个美军士兵强奸一个十五岁的西德女学生的事件的报告之后通过这个决议的。在巴伐利亚州最近还发生过另外两件类似的事件。
    不久以前在慕尼黑还发生了美军士兵把一个手榴弹投入跳舞厅使十七人受伤的事件，这个事件引起了巴伐利亚州议会的议员们的强烈抗议。
    美联社指出，“德国人对盟国士兵的行为不端的抗议已达到了一个新的高峰。”最近以来，驻在西德的美军军官们不断收到要求他们回家去的信件，信中说：“德国民族的忍耐已经到达顶点了，回家去吧，现在还不算太晚。”
