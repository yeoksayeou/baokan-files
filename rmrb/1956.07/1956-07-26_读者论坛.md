    Rebuking Nixon
    Editor's Note:
    U.S. Vice President Nixon, during his visit to Asia, said that any Asian country that accepts aid from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries is risking a rope being put around its neck. We have received many letters from readers refuting Nixon's lies and slanders. We have selected a few to publish below:

    Asian People Draw Their Own Conclusions
    Nixon said that backward countries accepting Soviet economic aid run the risk of "having a rope put around their necks," thinking that by reversing black and white, he could trick the Asian people. But Nixon's slander against the Soviet Union is futile. "True gold fears no fire." The Soviet Union cares about helping backward countries develop their national economies and safeguard their independence and autonomy, and there is evidence to prove this. The Soviet Union's assistance in building 211 industrial enterprises in China has provided enormous assistance to China's industrialization. The Soviet Union's assistance to India in establishing the steel industry, to Egypt in establishing the nuclear physics laboratory, and to Afghanistan in building industry are all facts that Nixon cannot deny.

    Now let's look at the other side of the facts! The United States is the country that demands part of the territory of the Philippines in exchange for "aid"; that causes a reduction in Thailand's rice and timber exports; and that dumps large quantities of cotton to Pakistan, which exports cotton. In particular, the recent fact that the United States has threatened some countries with the cessation of "U.S. aid" if they do not improve friendly relations with socialist countries has further exposed the true face of so-called "U.S. aid."

    The Asian people have never had such a naive idea that the U.S. government would selflessly help backward countries develop their national economies. The Asian people, who have long suffered from imperialist enslavement, have soberly concluded: accepting "U.S. aid" is what puts "a rope around their necks."

                      Spitting Blood
    U.S. Vice President Nixon's recent speech in Karachi was a deliberate attempt to lie through his teeth. People have long tasted the bitterness of "U.S. aid," and recently the voices calling for breaking free from "U.S. aid" control and implementing peaceful neutrality have become louder and louder. The call for "trade, not U.S. aid" has broken through the "embargo" gap. Nixon and his ilk are worried about the fate of "U.S. aid," so they use the means of slandering Soviet aid to find a market for the noose of "U.S. aid."

    The cause of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and other countries in the world is developing day by day. The Soviet Union's selfless foreign aid is increasingly welcomed and approved by the people of all countries. Nixon has long admitted that the United States faces a "painful dilemma" in dealing with the Soviet Union's peaceful actions. In the midst of this "painful" "dilemma," Nixon can only resort to the trick of spitting blood.

    However, slander is of no avail. The facts are before our eyes, and people are naturally clear. No wonder newspapers in India, Indonesia, Burma, Egypt, and other countries have criticized Nixon's nonsense in recent days.

                        Comparing Goods
    The United States provides a large amount of aid to other countries in the form of murderous weapons that prepare for war and destroy civilization; while Soviet aid consists of machines and equipment needed to develop industry, create wealth, and improve people's lives.

    The United States forcibly occupies the mining rights of oil and minerals in the countries of the Near and Middle East and stifles their ability to develop science and technology; while the Soviet Union is helping India and other countries develop their national industries... The Soviet Union provides technical assistance to backward countries and actively helps them train their own scientific and technical personnel.

    The United States disregards the economic interests of other countries and forcibly dumps its agricultural products, while when Egypt's cotton and Burma's rice were difficult to sell, the socialist countries extended a hand of friendship and purchased them in large quantities.

    The United States takes advantage of others' difficulties and drastically lowers prices when Indonesia and Ceylon have unsold rubber; while the socialist countries help people in need and purchase their rubber at fair and reasonable prices.

    The United States wants the recipient countries to "mortgage our freedom" (Nehru's words); while the socialist countries attach no political or economic conditions whatsoever.

    Countries that accept U.S. aid have deteriorating economies, lose sovereignty and humiliate the country, and the people live in poverty; while countries that accept Soviet aid can build their own industries, improve people's lives, and embark on the road to independence.

      "Comparing goods" is the best way to deal with peddlers of fake medicine.

    斥尼克松编者按：
    美国副总统尼克松，在访问亚洲期间说，任何亚洲国家接受苏联和人民民主国家的援助，就是甘冒脖子上被套上绳子的危险。我们接到不少读者来信，驳斥尼克松这样谎言谰语，现在挑选几封发表如下：亚洲人民作出结论
    尼克松说，落后国家接受苏联经济援助要冒“在脖子上被套上绳子”的危险，以为这样颠倒黑白，就可以使亚洲人民上了圈套。但是尼克松对苏联的污蔑是徒劳的。“真金不怕火炼”。苏联关心的是帮助落后国家发展民族经济，维护这些国家的独立自主，这有事实为证。苏联帮助中国建设211项工业企业给了中国工业化以巨大援助，苏联帮助印度建立钢铁工业，帮助埃及建立核子物理实验所，帮助阿富汗建设工业等等都是尼克松否定不了的事实。
    再看一看另一方面的事实吧！借“援助”要求菲律宾一部分领土的；造成泰国大米、木材出口减少的；向输出棉花的巴基斯坦大量倾销棉花的是美国。特别是最近美国以停止“美援”威胁一些国家不许它们同社会主义国家增进友好关系的事实，更暴露了所谓“美援”的真面目。
    要美国政府无私地帮助落后国家发展民族经济，亚洲人民从来没有这种天真的想法。曾经长期饱受帝国主义奴役的亚洲人民清醒地做出了结论：接受“美援”才会在自己的“脖子上被套上绳子”。

                      含血喷人
    美国副总统尼克松最近在喀喇蚩发表的演说是有意瞪着眼睛说瞎话。人们早已尝够了“美援”的滋味，近来要求摆脱“美援”控制、实行和平中立的声浪越来越大，“要贸易不要美援”的呼声已冲破了“禁运”的缺口，尼克松之流担心“美援”的命运，就用诬蔑苏联援助的手段来为“美援”的套索找寻市场。
    苏联及人民民主国家与世界各国友好合作事业日益发展，苏联大公无私的对外援助越来越得到各国人民的欢迎和赞同，尼克松早就承认过美国在对待苏联的和平行动上面临着“痛苦的进退两难局面”，在这“痛苦”的“进退两难”之余，尼克松就只能求救于含血喷人的伎俩了。
    不过，诬蔑是无济于事的。事实摆在眼前，人们自然一清二楚，难怪乎连日来印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、埃及等国报刊都纷纷抨击尼克松的谰言了。

                        以货比货
    美国大量援助别国的是准备战争、毁灭文明的杀人凶器；而苏联的援助是发展工业、创造财富、改善人民生活所需的机器和设备。
    美国强占着中近东国家的石油、矿产的开采权，并扼杀他们发展科学技术的能力；而苏联却正在帮助印度等国发展民族工业……。苏联对落后国家提供技术援助，并积极帮助他们培养本国的科学技术人员。
    美国不顾别国经济利益，强制倾销其农产品，而当埃及棉花、缅甸大米销售困难的时候，社会主义国家伸出了友谊的手，大批购买了它。
    美国乘人之危，当印度尼西亚，锡兰的橡胶滞销的时候，大力压价；而社会主义国家救人之急，以公平合理的价格购买了他们的橡胶。
    美国要受援国家，“拿出我们的自由去抵押”（尼赫鲁语）；而社会主义国家却完全不附带任何政治、经济条件。
    接受美援的国家，经济日益恶化，丧权辱国，民不聊生；而接受苏联援助，能建设自己的工业，改善人民生活，走上独立的道路。
      “货比货”这是对付贩卖假药骗子的最好办法。
