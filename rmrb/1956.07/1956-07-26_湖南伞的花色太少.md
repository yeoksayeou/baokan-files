    Hunan Umbrellas Have Too Few Colors
    The umbrellas currently produced in Hunan Province generally only come in red and black, and the styles are old and heavy, so large quantities are backlogged in various places. Wenzhou umbrellas have more colors and novel styles, and are popular with consumers.
    Hunan umbrellas were once bestsellers throughout the country. They must summarize the lessons learned from losing market credibility.

    湖南伞的花色太少
    湖南省目前生产的雨伞一般只有红、黑两色，式样古老、笨重，因此各地积压数量很大；温州伞花色多，式样新颖，受到消费者的欢迎。
    湖南伞曾一度畅销全国，他们必须总结失去市场信誉的教训。
