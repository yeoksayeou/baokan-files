Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 2nd. The Soviet Union-created atomic-powered aircraft has moved from the design and individual component testing phase to ground and flight testing. As early as the end of 1955, the results of the first flight test of an aircraft equipped with an atomic reactor were obtained.

Soviet engineer Sushkov discussed these developments in an article recently published in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda".

Sushkov said that the atomic jet engine is manufactured according to the principle of jet engines. It allows air from the compressor to enter the atomic reactor. The air is heated to approximately the same temperature as when gasoline burns as it passes through the tubes of the reactor. It is then ejected through the jet nozzle, forming a jet propulsion force, propelling the aircraft forward.

Using nuclear fuel can generate heat energy that is more than two million times greater than gasoline. This ensures that the aircraft can fly fast and far, without having to land midway due to insufficient fuel. For example, the "TU-104" jet airliner consumes approximately 150 tons of gasoline to fly from Moscow to Vladivostok at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, while an atomic-powered aircraft would only need 70 to 75 centimeters of nuclear fuel. The volume of this fuel is only about the size of a walnut.

Sushkov also said that atomic energy can be used in another way on aircraft. That is, the atomic reactor can be used as a heat source for generating steam, which is then used to turn the aircraft's propellers. Tests have shown that an atomic reactor can provide steam for several turbines.

To protect the staff and passengers on the aircraft from radiation from the reactor, a protection method has been tested. This involves placing the reactor in the tail of the aircraft and installing a layer of concrete shielding between the reactor and the cabin. However, with this shielding, passengers cannot immediately disembark after the aircraft lands but must wait until the reactor has been removed. Research is currently underway to develop a new protective alloy, and this problem should be resolved soon.

### 苏联原子能飞机转入飞行试验阶段

    苏联原子能飞机转入飞行试验阶段
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联创制的原子能飞机已经从设计和试验个别部件的阶段，转入了地面试验和飞行试验阶段。早在1955年年底，就已经获得了装有原子能反应堆的飞机的第一次飞行试验的结果。
    苏联工程师苏什科夫最近在苏联“共青团真理报”上发表的一篇文章中谈到了这些情况。
    苏什科夫说，原子能喷气发动机是根据喷气发动机的原理来制造的。它使从压缩机来的空气进入原子反应堆，空气在穿过反应堆的管子的时候，加热到大约和汽油燃烧时一样的温度，然后就通过喷气孔喷出来，形成喷气推动力，推动飞机前进。
    利用核子燃料，能够产生比汽油高二百万倍以上的热能。这样，就能够保证飞机飞得快，又飞得远，不致因为燃料不足而中途着陆。例如，“TY—104”喷气式客机以每小时八百公里的速度从莫斯科飞到海参崴，大约要消耗一百五十吨的汽油，而原子能飞机只用七十到七十五公分的核子燃料就够了。这些燃料的体积只有一个核桃那么大。
    苏什科夫还说，在飞机上还可以用另外一种方式来利用原子能。这就是把原子反应堆作为产生蒸汽的热源，利用蒸汽来转动飞机的螺旋桨。试验证明，一个原子反应堆可以保证几个涡轮机用的蒸汽。
    为了保护飞机上的工作人员和乘客不受反应堆辐射线的伤害，已经试验出一种保护方法。这就是把反应堆放在飞机的尾部，在反应堆和座舱之间安放一层混凝土保护壁。但是，有了这种保护壁，旅客在飞机着陆后还不能立刻下飞机，而要等到把反应堆搬走后才能下飞机。现在，正在研究制造一种新的保护合金，这个问题不久就可以得到解决。
