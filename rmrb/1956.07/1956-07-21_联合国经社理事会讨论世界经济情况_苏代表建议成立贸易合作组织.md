Xinhua News Agency, Geneva: The United Nations Economic and Social Council began a general debate on the world economic situation on July 16th and 18th.

United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that the economies of underdeveloped countries are not stable enough, the level of international trade is not satisfactory, and the prices of major raw materials are not stable. He said that "the stability and expansion of trade" is "the best way to help" the economic development of underdeveloped countries.

Gunnar Myrdal, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, pointed out in his speech that military programs are a "serious burden on the economies of various countries." He said that excessive military expenditures have caused many serious consequences, such as inflation. Myrdal said that if military expenditures were reduced and East-West trade expanded, it would bring economic benefits to Europe. He called for efforts to get rid of various obstacles and expand international trade.

P.S. Lokanathan, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, pointed out: "The progress of planned economies is the best aspect of recent economic development in Asia."

Soviet representative Zakharov spoke at the meeting on the 18th, talking about the destructive impact of arms expansion on the economies of Western countries, which swallowed up a large part of their products and created difficulties for these countries' economies.

Zakharov said that the current economic difficulties of some countries can be alleviated by maximizing mutually beneficial trade. He urged the Economic and Social Council to quickly find ways to eliminate restrictions hindering economic cooperation.

Zakharov pointed out that it is abnormal that there is no worldwide organization within the United Nations to promote commercial cooperation. The Soviet delegation will submit a proposal at this meeting suggesting expanding trade and eliminating discriminatory restrictions and obstacles hindering international trade, as well as establishing an international trade cooperation organization within the United Nations that all member states and other relevant countries can participate in.

    联合国经社理事会讨论世界经济情况 
    苏代表建议成立贸易合作组织
    据新华社讯　日内瓦消息：联合国经济及社会理事会会议七月十六日和十八日开始就世界经济状况进行一般辩论。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德首先在会议上发言。他指出，不发达的国家的经济不够稳定，国际贸易的水平不能令人满意，主要原料的价格也不平稳。他说，“贸易的稳定和扩大”是对不发达的国家的经济发展“最好的帮助方式”。
    联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书密达尔在发言中指出，军备计划是“各国经济的严重负担”。他说，过大的军事费用引起了许多严重的后果、例如通货膨胀就是其中之一。密达尔说，如果缩减军备和扩大东西方贸易，那就会给欧洲带来经济利益。他要求尽力摆脱各种障碍，扩大国际贸易。
    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会执行秘书普洛卡纳桑指出：“计划经济的进步是最近亚洲经济发展的最好的一个方面。”
    苏联代表扎哈罗夫在十八日会议上发言，他谈到扩充军备对西方国家的经济所产生的破坏性的影响，它吞去了它们的产品的一大部分，给这些国家的经济造成了困难。
    扎哈罗夫说，某些国家目前的经济困难可以通过尽量发展互利的贸易来减轻，他敦促经社理事会赶快设法消除妨碍经济合作的限制。
    扎哈罗夫指出，联合国里没有一个促进商业合作的世界性机构的情况是不正常的。苏联代表团将在这次会议上提出一个提案，建议扩大贸易和消除妨碍国际贸易的歧视性的限制和障碍，以及在联合国内建立一个各会员国和其他有关国家都能够参加的国际贸易合作组织。
