Academic Activities of Foreign Historians and Archaeologists in Beijing

    Recently, various historians and archaeologists visiting China have conducted a series of academic activities in Beijing.

    Vietnam:陶维英 Tao Weiying, a member of the Education Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and a professor of Vietnamese History at Hanoi University of Arts and Sciences, visited Chinese ancient history experts at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University after arriving in Beijing. He collected Chinese texts related to ancient Vietnamese history and learned about the Chinese historical community's research on major historical issues. He raised historical questions such as "The Issue of Jiaozhi in Chinese Ancient Books" and "The Luo Yue People Among the Bai Yue," exchanging opinions with Chinese experts. He expressed hope for further cooperation between Chinese and Vietnamese historians in the future.

    Mongolia: According to the "1956 Sino-Mongolian Cultural Cooperation Plan," the People's Republic of Mongolia sent Iszhamts, Director of the History Research Office of the Science Committee, to China in May to collect materials related to Mongolian history. After arriving in Beijing, Iszhamts, with the assistance of historians such as Hou Wailu, Weng Dujian, and Liu Danian, has begun his work and regularly exchanges opinions on Mongolian history with Chinese historians. He also plans to visit cities such as Nanjing and Hohhot to collect historical materials on the spot.

    Egypt: Fekri, Professor of Ancient Egyptian History and Oriental History at Cairo University in Egypt, who visited China according to the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Talks Minutes, delivered a systematic lecture series on "Ancient Egyptian History" at Peking University during his visit to Beijing, and gave special lectures on "Egyptian Antiquities" and "Ancient Egyptian Culture." On May 29th, he presented a report on recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt at an academic symposium held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and had discussions with Chinese scholars. Yin Da, Deputy Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presided over the symposium. Archaeologists and historians such as Xia Nai, Pei Wenzhong, Guo Baojun, Xu Bingchang, Huang Wenbi, and Tang Lan attended the meeting. At the meeting, Yin Da presented Professor Fekri with a collection of Chinese archaeological books on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Fekri repeatedly expressed his hope that Chinese archaeologists would visit Egypt.

    Australia: Charles Patrick Fitzgerald, head of the Australian Cultural Delegation and Professor of Far Eastern History at the Australian National University, spoke on "The Issue of Sino-Australian Relations Before the 19th Century" at an academic symposium of the Foreign Cultural Association on May 12th. Hou Wailu, Deputy Director of the Second Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presided over the symposium. Shao Xunzheng, Jin Yufu, Zhang Zhenglang, Deng Guangming, Rong Mengyuan, Kuang Pingzhang, and others, eighteen in total, attended the symposium. Professor Fitzgerald said that in 1876, on the western coast of Australia, a stone carving of "The Old Man of the South Pole" was found under the roots of an ancient tree during road construction, which was clearly introduced from China. Based on the "age" of the tree, the statue should have been brought by the Chinese in the early 18th century, or even earlier. In addition, maps drawn by the Chinese in the past have been discovered in Australia, also depicting the Australian continent. The experts attending the symposium were greatly interested in this issue. On May 14th, Peter Partridge, a member of the Australian Cultural Delegation and Professor of Social Philosophy at the Australian National University, gave a report on "The Research Situation of Australian Philosophy and History" for the faculty and students of the History and Philosophy Departments of Peking University. Jian Bozan, Chairman of the History Department of Peking University, presided over the report meeting. Professor Fitzgerald also presented Jian Bozan with a copy of his book, "Wu Zetian."

    Belgium: Fernand Vercauteren, a member of the Belgian Cultural Delegation and Professor of History at the University of Ghent, visited Chinese historians several times in Beijing and held discussions with Hou Wailu, He Changqun, and others. On June 1st, Professor Vercauteren introduced the recent research and debates in European historical circles regarding the medieval history of Western Europe at a report meeting held by the First and Second Institutes of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    New Zealand: Angus Ross, a member of the New Zealand cultural figures delegation and a history professor, visited Peking University several times in Beijing and had talks with Jian Bozan, Chairman of the History Department of Peking University, and other professors. On May 9th, Roger Duff, another member of the delegation, a museum director, and an archaeologist, gave a report on "Talking about the Past of New Zealand from Archaeological Excavations" at the History Department of Peking University. Duff also had several conversations with Wu Zhongchao, Director of the Palace Museum, and hoped to maintain close contact in the future. (Yi Hao)

    外国历史、考古学者在北京的学术活动
    最近来中国访问的各国历史学家、考古学家在北京进行了一系列的学术活动。
    越南　越南民主共和国教育代表团团员、河内文科师范大学越南史教授陶维英到达北京后，曾多次访问中国科学院和北京大学等高等学校的中国古代史专家，一方面搜集有关越南古代史的汉文资料，一方面了解中国史学界对历史上各项重大问题的研究情况。他提出了“中国古籍中的交趾问题”、“百越中的骆越人”等历史问题，同中国的专家们交换了意见。他希望中越两国的史学家今后进一步合作。
    蒙古　根据“中蒙1956年文化合作计划”，蒙古人民共和国于五月间派科学委员会历史研究室主任依斯札姆茨来中国，搜集有关蒙古历史的资料。依斯札姆茨到北京后，已在侯外庐、翁独健、刘大年等历史学家协助下开始工作，并经常同中国的历史学家交换有关蒙古史问题的意见。他还准备访问南京、呼和浩特等城市，随地进行搜集史料的工作。
    埃及　根据中埃文化合作会谈纪要来我国访问的埃及开罗大学埃及古代史和东方史教授费克里，在访问北京期间，曾在北京大学担任系统的“埃及古代史”讲座，并作了“埃及的古迹”、“埃及的古代文化”等专题讲演。五月二十九日，他在中国科学院召开的学术座谈会上，作了关于近年来埃及考古新发现的报告，并同中国学者们进行了座谈。座谈会由中国科学院考古所副所长尹达主持。出席这次座谈会的，有考古学家和历史学家夏鼐、裴文中、郭宝钧、徐炳昶、黄文弼、唐兰等。会上，尹达代表中国科学院赠送费克里教授一批中国考古学书籍。费克里再三表示，希望中国的考古学家到埃及去访问。
    澳大利亚　澳大利亚文化代表团团长、澳大利亚大学远东史教授查派·费兹吉拉，五月十二日，在对外文化协会的学术座谈会上，作了“十九世纪以前中澳关系问题”的发言。座谈会由中国科学院历史研究所第二所副所长侯外庐主持。出席座谈会的，有邵循正、金毓黻、张政烺、邓广铭、荣孟源、邝平章等十八人。费兹吉拉教授说，1876年在澳大利亚西部海岸，因为修路，在一棵古树的树根下边发现了一个石刻的“老寿星”，这显然是从中国传入的。根据树的“年龄”判断，这石像应该是在十八世纪初期，甚至还在这以前，由中国人带去的。另外，在澳洲还发现了过去中国人所绘制的地图，上面也画上了澳洲这片陆地。参加座谈会的专家们对这个问题感到很大的兴趣。五月十四日，澳大利亚文化代表团团员、澳大利亚大学社会哲学教授伯·赫·派脱利奇在北京大学为历史系和哲学系的师生作了关于“澳大利亚哲学和历史学的研究情况”的报告。报告会由北京大学历史系系主任翦伯赞主持。费兹吉拉教授还曾送给翦伯赞一本他自己的著作——“武则天”。
    比利时　比利时文化代表团团员、根特大学历史教授东特，在北京时曾多次访问中国的历史学家，并同侯外庐、贺昌群等举行座谈。六月一日，东特教授在中国科学院历史研究所第一、二所举行的一次报告会上，介绍了欧洲史学界最近关于西欧中世纪史的研究情况和争论的问题。
    新西兰　新西兰文化界人士访华团团员、历史学教授艾格斯·罗斯在北京时曾几次访问北京大学，并同北京大学历史系系主任翦伯赞和其他教授等进行谈话。五月九日，该团另一团员、博物馆馆长、考古学家罗吉尔·德夫在北京大学历史系作了关于“从考古发掘谈新西兰的过去”的报告。德夫还同故宫博物院院长吴仲超有过几次谈话。并且希望今后保持密切联系。　（亦浩）
