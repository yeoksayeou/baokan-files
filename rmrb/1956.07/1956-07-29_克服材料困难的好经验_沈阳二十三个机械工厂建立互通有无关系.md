Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 27th (Xinhua reporter Shen Ping) reported: Twenty-three state-owned and local state-owned mechanical factories in Shenyang have established a relationship of mutual exchange of raw materials, ensuring the timely supply of raw materials.

    The supply departments of these factories exchange information on the basis of raw material reserves and production needs, so that you help me and I help you. When the Shenyang Water Pump Factory was manufacturing water pumps for agricultural producers' cooperatives in the first half of this year, it urgently needed a batch of bearings. The supply section of the factory contacted the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory and borrowed 100 bearings, ensuring the delivery time. In April of this year, the casting workshop of Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory temporarily received a batch of increased production tasks, and a raw material - sand - was not enough. In an emergency, they asked the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory for sand and received a timely supply. When the Shenyang Fan Factory was producing main shafts, it lacked round steel, but had a lot of steel plates that were temporarily not needed; the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory was feeling the lack of steel plates for producing friction plates, but had a lot of round steel, so the two factories exchanged materials, ensuring the smooth progress of production.

    The exchange of raw materials between factories is becoming more and more frequent. In the first half of this year alone, three state-owned machine tool factories, including Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, supported more than 50 factories with raw materials worth more than 2 million yuan, and they themselves also received assistance from more than 40 brother factories, fully exploiting the potential of existing raw materials.

    克服材料困难的好经验
    沈阳二十三个机械工厂建立互通有无关系
    新华社沈阳27日电　新华社记者沈平报道：沈阳市二十三个国营和地方国营机械工厂建立了原材料互通有无的关系，保证了原材料的及时供应。
    这些工厂的供应部门，根据原材料的储备情况和生产的需要互通有无，做到你帮我、我帮你。沈阳水泵厂在今年上半年给农业生产合作社制造水泵的时候，急需一批轴承。这个工厂的供应科便和沈阳第三机床厂联系，借来了一百个轴承，保证了交货时间。今年四月，沈阳第三机床厂铸工车间临时接到了一批增产任务，有一种原材料——砂子不够用，他们在紧急关头向沈阳第一机床厂提出了需要砂子的请求，结果得到了及时的供应。沈阳扇风机厂生产主轴的时候缺少元钢，但是有很多钢板又暂时不需用；沈阳第三机床厂生产磨擦片用的钢板正感到不足，元钢却有很多，于是，两个工厂互通有无，保证了生产的顺利进行。
    各厂之间原材料互通有无的来往日趋频繁。仅沈阳第一机床厂等三个国营机床厂在今年上半年里，就以价值二百多万元的原材料支援了五十多个工厂，它们本身也得到了四十多个兄弟工厂的帮助，充分地发挥了现有原材料的潜力。
