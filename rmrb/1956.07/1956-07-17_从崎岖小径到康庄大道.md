I. Bitter Recollections of the Past

In 1920, when I was nine years old, I entered the Suzhou Kunqu Opera Training School to study. The training school was established by some Kunqu opera enthusiasts who, witnessing the risk of Kunqu opera being lost, contributed funds to establish it. The teachers gave us stage names that all included the character "传" (chuan, transmit), meaning that we should pass on Kunqu opera. However, in the old society for more than twenty years, despite our efforts and struggles, we not only failed to reverse the decline of Kunqu opera, but we even couldn't survive ourselves. Now we are fortunate to have lived to this era of "Let a hundred flowers bloom." Only under the leadership of the Communist Party has Kunqu opera, this ancient art form, regained new life and restored its youth. Looking back on the past and comparing it to the present, we cannot help but feel many emotions and, at the same time, feel boundless excitement.

After completing our studies at the training school, we, fifty or so fellow students, formed the "Xianni Society," and performed in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. The "Xianni Society" barely managed to survive until 1940, eventually disbanding due to difficult circumstances. After the "Xianni Society" disbanded, the fates of my fellow students were very tragic. Many talented brothers died of poverty and illness, and only twenty-one are still alive today.

After the "Xianni Society" disbanded, I myself became a homeless wanderer. The difficulties of life pushed me to the point where I had no way out, and I even lingered on the banks of the Huangpu River several times, contemplating suicide. Later, I joined the Guofeng Troupe. We took our children and wandered from Shanghai to Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and other places, performing while living as vagrants. During the most difficult times, we couldn't eat a decent meal for an entire week, and even after performing two shows a day, we could only drink thin porridge. Without a band, Comrade Zhang Lanting learned to play six instruments simultaneously to provide accompaniment; when performing Kunqu opera and there was no one to play the flute, the actors took turns to play it themselves. For example, when Wang Chuansong went on stage, I would play the flute backstage; when I went on stage, Wang Chuansong would play the flute backstage. Once, when we were all on stage at the same time, after singing my lines, I turned around on stage, pulled down my beard, and played the flute. With so few actors, we had to play three or four roles each. Sometimes one person had to play both a black-faced and a white-faced character at the same time. Unable to change makeup in time, we used a paper black face mask as a substitute. Our children, as young as five or six years old, went on stage to play extras. The children playing the yamen runners were so short that the actor playing the prisoner had to lower his head for them to put the rope on. No matter how difficult it was, we always performed seriously, barely keeping the small lifelines of Kunqu opera and Su opera faintly alive.

The number of people in the troupe slowly increased, but life remained very difficult. We performed two shows every day, but often didn't get a single penny. We didn't even have money to make a cup of tea. If we could eat a meal of white rice, with eight or nine people sharing a piece of stinky tofu, we would treat it as a feast, eating and chatting happily.

The hardships in life were relatively easy to endure, but the persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries was unbearable. At that time, our performances were often sold out, but they were all free shows for the Kuomintang soldiers. They made a lot of noise and didn't pay a single penny. Sometimes they wanted us to perform obscene plays. When we refused, they would come on stage with guns and beat us. Once, two bullies ordered two plays at the same time. We performed one play, and the other one held a grudge. The next day, during the performance, he wrapped a stone in a banknote and threw it angrily at the stage, and the performance couldn't continue. In this way, we endured humiliation, buried our resentment in our hearts, and struggled through the hardships until the liberation in 1949.

    从崎岖小径到康庄大道
    周传瑛
    周传瑛同志是昆曲演员，在“十五贯”中成功地塑造了况钟的舞台形象。文章是由他口述，钱法成同志纪录整理的，因篇幅较长，本刊拟分四期登完。——编者
    一、辛酸话往事
    1920年我九岁的时候，进苏州昆曲传习所学习。传习所是一些昆曲爱好者目睹昆曲有失传的危险而出资举办的。老师给我们取的艺名里都有一个“传”字，就是要我们把昆曲传下去的意思。可是在旧社会的二十多年里，尽管我们也曾努力奋斗过，却不仅挽不回昆曲的衰颓，甚至我们自己也活不下去。现在我们庆幸活到了这个“百花齐放”的时代。只是在共产党的领导下，昆曲这个古老的剧种才又得到了新的生命，恢复了它的青春。抚今追昔，我们不能不有很多感慨，同时又不能不感到无比的兴奋。
    在传习所学满之后，我们五十来个师兄弟组成了“仙霓社”，曾在苏州、杭州、上海、南京等地演出。“仙霓社”勉强维持到1940年，终因处境困难而解散了。“仙霓社”解散以后，我们师兄弟的遭遇都很悲惨，不少有才华的弟兄们都贫病而死，现在活着的只不过二十一人了。
    我自己在“仙霓社”解散以后，就成了无家可归的流浪汉，生活的困难逼得我无路可走，甚至几次徘徊在黄浦江畔，起过自杀的念头。后来我参加了国风剧团。我们带着自己的子女从上海向苏州、嘉兴、杭州等地一面演出，一面流浪。最困难的时候，整整一星期吃不上一顿饭，每天演两场戏，也只能喝点稀粥。没有乐队，乐师张兰亭同志就学习一个人同时掌握六种乐器来伴奏；演昆曲的时候没有人吹笛子，演员就自己轮流来吹，比如王传淞上台，我就在台后吹笛，我上台，王传淞就在台后吹笛。有一次大家同时上台，我唱完自己的几句唱词以后，就在舞台上转身拉下髯口吹笛。演员少，我们就一个人赶三、四个角色，有时一个人同时要赶黑脸白脸二个角色，来不及改妆，就用纸做个黑脸套来代替化妆。我们的子女，五、六岁就上台跑龙套，装差役的孩子个子矮，装犯人的演员必须低下头去，他才套得上绳子。不管多么困难，我们始终认真地演出，勉强地使昆剧和苏剧的小小的命脉微弱地延续下来。
    剧团的人慢慢增加，但是依然很艰苦。每天演两场戏，却常分不到一个钱，想泡杯茶喝也没有钱。如果能吃一顿白米饭，八、九个人有一块臭豆腐下饭，大家就会把它当成是一顿美餐，吃得谈笑风生的了。
    生活上的苦，倒还容易忍受，难于忍受的是国民党反动派对我们的迫害。那时候演戏也常常客满，但都是看白戏的国民党官兵。他们吵吵闹闹，一个钱都不给。有时候他们要我们唱黄色戏，我们不唱，他们就持枪上台殴打。有一次，有两个恶霸同时点了两出戏，我们唱了一出，另一个人就怀恨在心，第二天演戏的时候，他用一张钞票包着一块石头恨恨地朝台上掷来，结果戏也演不下去了。就这样，我们忍受着侮辱，把愤恨埋在心里，在苦难中挣扎到了1949年解放。
