    Uzbekistan Impressions (Part Two)
    By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
    Transforming "Wasteland" into Oasis
    We traveled from Tashkent to the ancient city of Samarkand, 300 kilometers to its southwest. On the flat highway, the car sped along at 50 to 60 kilometers per hour. The blue Turkestan Mountains stretched endlessly to the south, their peaks capped with year-round snow. Beyond them lay the Tajik Republic.
    Tashkent and Samarkand are both oases, but between them lies a vast expanse of what is called "wasteland." This "wasteland" adjoins the Kyzylkum Desert of Kazakhstan to the west, reaches the foothills of the Turkestan Mountains to the south, and borders the Syr Darya River to the north and east. Even before the arrival of summer, we felt the heat and dryness of the Gobi on this grassland.
    "Wasteland" is the old name. The grassland originally lacked water, and no crops grew. Only in spring did grass grow, and people came here to graze cattle and sheep. By the end of May, summer arrived, the grass withered, and the herders left.
    Bringing water to irrigate the "wasteland" was the ideal of the Uzbek and Kazakh people for many centuries. The widely circulated story of Farhad and Shirin reflects this ideal. Folk legend says that at the exit of the Fergana Basin, on the rocks now called Shirin-Farhad, there was once a castle where a beautiful princess, Shirin, lived. Many young men pursued her. She liked the warrior Farhad and the handsome Khosrau, and did not know whom to choose. She agreed to marry the one who could bring water to irrigate the wasteland at the foot of the mountain. Farhad took a moon-shaped hoe and went to work. He chiseled large stones from the rocks and threw them into the river, hoping to raise the water level and divert the Syr Darya River to irrigate the "wasteland." Khosrau, however, resorted to trickery. He adopted the witch's scheme, bought many reed mats, and secretly laid them on the grassland in front of the castle at night. When Shirin came out early in the morning and saw the sunlight shining on the reed mats, she mistook it for a sheet of water and married Khosrau. When Farhad heard about this, he broke his skull with the moon-shaped hoe. Later, Shirin realized she had been deceived and also committed suicide.
    The people's desire to irrigate the "wasteland" with the water of the Syr Darya was realized under the socialist system. The Farhad Hydropower Station was completed on the Syr Darya in 1948. The dam built at Farhad Rock raised the water level of the Syr Darya by 20 meters. The Syr Darya water, through the Kirov Canal and the South "Wasteland" Canal, irrigated 200,000 hectares of land in the "wasteland," of which 105,000 hectares were in Uzbekistan and 95,000 hectares were in Kazakhstan.
    We saw the irrigation system along the way. The large canals were like rivers, navigable by ships. Along with the irrigation canals, there were also drainage canals crisscrossing the land to improve the soil. The soil of the "wasteland" is a deep gray saline-alkali soil, so it is necessary to wash the salt from the soil and discharge the alkaline water into the drainage canals.
    The project to develop the "wasteland" is immense. The immense project reflects the great power of the people to transform nature. They have already turned part of the "wasteland" into a rich oasis. Tens of thousands of peasant households have moved from the densely populated Fergana Basin and the Samarkand and Kashkadarya regions at the call of the Party. Eight districts have emerged in the oasis, more than 100 cotton collective farms and twelve machine tractor stations have been established, as well as a number of large state farms. On the fertile gray-calcareous soil grow abundant cotton, apples, figs, grapes, corn, and vegetables.
    There are still 600,000 hectares of irrigable new land in the "wasteland" waiting to be reclaimed.

    Water is the Mother of Harvest
    The revival of the "wasteland" made me realize once again that water is the lifeline of the people of Central Asia. The Uzbeks have a saying: "Giving a drop of water to a thirsty person in the desert can wash away a hundred years of sin." This shows how much they cherish water.
    The Soviet Union grows cotton in all the republics of Central Asia, the Caucasus, Ukraine, and Moldavia, but nowhere is the cotton acreage comparable to that of Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan's cotton production accounts for two-thirds of the entire Soviet Union. This is also because this republic has a lot of water. The snow-capped mountains are all outside the republic, but the abundant water flowing from these mountains flows into its territory. The two rivers of Central Asia (Amu Darya and Syr Darya) and their tributaries nourish Uzbekistan. Therefore, there is a particularly large amount of irrigated land here, and in the next few years it will be possible to expand the irrigated area without major investment. The comrades in charge of water conservancy in the Uzbek Republic said: The republic has 4.6 million hectares of cultivated land, of which 2.5 million hectares are irrigated land. One million six hundred thousand hectares of irrigated land have been accumulated over many centuries, and about 900,000 hectares have been added in the more than 30 years since the establishment of the Soviet regime.
    There are 830 irrigation systems of all sizes. If all the canals are connected, the length exceeds 160,000 kilometers, and 28 billion cubic meters of river water are irrigated every year. Water conservancy work has been carried out in two aspects: building new ones and renovating old ones. The Great Fergana Canal, which was completed before the war and is 270 kilometers long, benefits 570,000 hectares of land. The 180-kilometer-long Ischi-Angar ancient canal will be restored.
    The Uzbeks knew about irrigation very early, but before the government belonged to the people, water and land were in the hands of landlords and Bayis. Today, water and land belong to the people, which is the result of a struggle. The older generation of Uzbek farmers still remember the scenes of land and water reform from 1925 to 1927. In Uzbekistan, landlords and Bayis were eliminated, and 66,000 landless and land-poor farmers were given land, livestock, farm tools, and seeds. The irrigation system also belonged to the people. In this struggle, the outstanding sons and daughters of Uzbekistan left many touching deeds.
    The story goes back to 1925. A young man, Yunusov, who was less than 23 years old, directed the land and water reform work near Tashkent. The Bayis who monopolized the water tried to bribe him. He returned the Bayis' bribes. The Bayis assassinated him. The local people left these lines on Yunusov's tombstone: "The sun is the father of the harvest, and water is the mother of the harvest. You fought, Comrade Yunusov, to make water belong to the people. We swear to take back water and the sun from the murderers."

    In the Land of "White Gold"
    The Uzbeks say, "A drop of water, a handful of cotton." The soil here is good, there is plenty of sunshine, and there is plenty of water, so a lot of cotton is also grown. People call cotton "white gold." It is an important source of wealth for the people of this republic. Among the 2,414 collective farms in Uzbekistan, 2,136 grow cotton. "Millionaires" can be seen everywhere in the countryside. 88% of the collective farms have incomes of more than one million rubles.
    Near Tashkent, we visited the Kaganovich Collective Farm, which has an annual cash income of nearly 20 million rubles. This farm was established during the collectivization of agriculture in 1930 and later developed. It now has 740 households and 4,030 people.
    Tursunkulov, the chairman of the collective farm who received us, was a thin, 65-year-old Uzbek with two gold stars of the Hero of Socialist Labor hanging on his chest. He came here in 1935 and was elected chairman. He has been chairman for 21 years now. He knows the farm like the back of his hand. He said that in the past, this was an alkaline land lacking water, and only 220 hectares of cotton were grown. Now, wasteland has been reclaimed, and the water has been introduced for four kilometers using the elevation, and 1,900 hectares of cotton have been planted. In the past, the land was controlled by two Bayis, who could do whatever they wanted, whether they wanted to grow crops or not, and they ruined the land; now, 1,540 laborers work together to cultivate 3,300 hectares of land and develop a diversified economy. In 1935, only 110 sheep and two cattle were raised; now, 14,000 livestock are raised. In 1935, the yield of cotton per hectare of land was five quintals; now, the yield is more than 30 quintals. In the past, there was no school here; now, there is a ten-year school, three seven-year schools, and several primary schools, as well as a hospital and a radio broadcasting station. In the past, individual farmers had a very difficult life; now, a laborer in the collective farm receives an average of 8,000 rubles and 1,500 kilograms of grain per year from labor day remuneration.
    Cotton growing is the main economy of the Kaganovich Collective Farm. In terms of average cotton yield, it belongs to the advanced collective farms in the republic. At the general meeting of the villagers in the spring, the summaries of the 20th National Congress of the CPSU and the tasks of the village in the Sixth Five-Year Plan were discussed. It was decided that this year's cotton production should be increased by 920 tons compared with last year, that is, to increase the yield per unit area and harvest more than 32 quintals of cotton per hectare from 1,900 hectares of cotton fields. The task is no small matter. The villagers have a high enthusiasm for production. There are 28 cotton production teams in the village, divided into 84 cotton production groups. Many production groups guarantee a cotton yield of 45 quintals per hectare, and three production groups are striving for a cotton yield of 70 quintals per hectare. The villagers are exploring all kinds of potential. The most important thing is the adoption of advanced farming techniques of square-hole planting and longitudinal and transverse inter-tillage in all cotton fields. This will greatly increase the yield per unit area and save about half the labor.
    In many collective farms in this "white gold" country, there are charts showing the development of cotton in the Uzbek Republic from 1954 to 1958, which were drawn up according to the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in February 1954. The chart points out that by 1958, the cotton planting area in the republic will reach 1.45 million hectares, and the total output will reach 4.2 million tons. The cotton production here was 2.99 million tons in 1954, 3.3 million tons in 1955, and will be 3.6 million tons in 1956, an increase of almost 300,000 tons each year. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the cotton production here will be about 5 million tons in 1960, which is achievable. How to achieve it? A responsible comrade from the Department of Agriculture of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan told us: "In addition to reclaiming wasteland and expanding cotton fields, the most important thing is to raise backward collective farms to medium collective farms, and to raise medium collective farms to advanced collective farms. There are still one-third of the collective farms that produce less than 15 quintals of cotton per hectare. If they are raised to the middle level, they can increase cotton production by more than 300,000 tons per year." From the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, we learned that the average cotton yield in the Uzbek Republic is now 22 quintals per hectare, and individual collective farms and production groups have reached 50 to 70 quintals. The average cotton yield per hectare in the Tajik Republic, which adopted the square-hole planting method earlier, is 26 quintals. It can be seen that there is still endless potential for the development of cotton production in Uzbekistan.

    乌兹别克斯坦见闻（下篇）
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    变“荒原”为绿洲
    我们从塔什干到它西南三百公里的古城撒马尔罕去。在平坦的公路上，汽车以每小时五六十里的速度奔驰着。南方蓝色的土耳克斯坦山脉连绵不绝，山顶露着终年不化的积雪，越过那里便是塔吉克共和国了。
    塔什干和撒马尔罕都是绿洲，中间却连接着一望无垠的所谓“荒原”。这个“荒原”西接哈萨克斯坦的克孜尔·库姆沙漠，南达土耳克斯坦山麓，北面和东面濒临锡尔河。还没有踏进夏季的门槛，我们经过这个草原已经感觉到一种戈壁上的炎热和干燥了。
    “荒原”是旧的名称。草原原来缺水，什么庄稼也不长。只在春天长青草，人们来这里放牧牛羊。五月一尽，夏天到来，草也晒枯了，牧人也走了。
    引水灌溉“荒原”是乌兹别克人和哈萨克人许多世纪的理想。流传很广的法尔哈德和师玲的故事，反映了这个理想。民间传说：在费尔干盆地的出口处，在现在叫做师玲—法尔哈德的山岩上，过去有一座城堡，那里有一位美丽的公主师玲。许多青年追求她。她喜欢勇士法尔哈德和美男子何斯拉夫，不知道选择谁好。她允许嫁给那个能够引水灌溉山坡下荒原的人。法尔哈德拿了月锄工作。他从山岩上凿下一块块大石头，把它们投到河里，想提高水位，引锡尔河水来灌溉“荒原”。何斯拉夫却玩弄手腕。他采纳女巫的诡计，买了许多芦苇编的席子，黑夜里偷偷地把它们铺在城堡前的草原上。师玲清早出来的时候，见到苇席上的阳光闪耀，误认是一片水光，就嫁给了何斯拉夫。法尔哈德听见这事，用月锄打破了自己的头颅。后来师玲知道受骗，也自尽了。
    人民引锡尔河水灌溉“荒原”的志愿，在社会主义制度下实现了。以法尔哈德为名的水电站1948年在锡尔河上落成了。在法尔哈德岩边建立起来的堤坝，把锡尔河的水位提高了二十公尺。锡尔河水位经过基洛夫干渠和南“荒原”水渠，灌溉了二十万公顷“荒原”上的土地，其中十万零五千公顷在乌兹别克斯坦境内，九万五千公顷在哈萨克斯坦境内。
    我们沿路看了灌溉系统。大的水渠像运河，可以行船。同灌溉渠一起，还纵横着改造土壤用的集水渠。“荒原”的土壤是深灰色的盐碱土，所以要用水冲洗土壤的盐分，把土壤里碱水承接到集水渠去。
    开发“荒原”的工程是浩大的。浩大的工程反映了人民改造自然的巨大的力量。他们已经把一部分“荒原”变成富庶的绿洲。成千成万户农民在党的号召下从人口稠密的费尔干盆地以及撒马尔罕州和卡什卡河州移来。在绿洲上出现了八个区，建立了一百多个棉花集体农庄，十二个机器拖拉机站和一批大型国营农场。在肥沃的灰钙土上长着丰盛的棉花、苹果、无花果、葡萄、玉米和蔬菜。
    “荒原”还有六十万公顷可灌溉的新地等待开垦。
    水是收获的母亲
    “荒原”的苏生，使我又一次领会到水是中亚人民的生命线。乌兹别克人有一句谚语：“供给在沙漠上渴极的人一滴水，能洗百年孽。”可见对水的珍惜。
    苏联在中亚细亚的各个共和国，高加索，乌克兰，摩尔达维亚都种棉花，但是没有一个地方种棉面积能赶得上乌兹别克斯坦。乌兹别克斯坦的棉花产量占全苏联的三分之二。这也是因为这个共和国的水多。常年积雪的高山都在共和国的境外，但从这些高山流下的丰富的水却流入它的境内。中亚细亚的两条河流（阿姆河和锡尔河）和它的支流滋养着乌兹别克斯坦。因此，这里灌溉的土地特别多，而且在最近若干年内还可以不必大笔投资而扩大灌溉面积。乌兹别克共和国负责水利的同志谈：共和国有四百六十万公顷耕地，其中二百五十万公顷是灌溉地。许多世纪以来累积了一百六十万公顷灌溉地，在苏维埃政权建立后的三十多年中又扩增约九十万公顷灌溉地。
    这里有八百三十个大小灌溉系统。如果把所有水渠衔接起来，长度超过十六万公里，每年灌溉河水二百八十亿立方公尺。水利工作一直沿着建设新的和改建旧的两个方面进行。战前建成的二百七十公里长的大费尔干运河使五十七万公顷土地受益。一百八十公里长的伊斯奇·安加尔古代水渠将予恢复。
    乌兹别克人很早知道灌溉，但是在政权属于人民之前，水和土地一样操在地主和大巴依手里。今天水和土地都归人民，是经过一番斗争的。乌兹别克老一辈农民还记得1925—1927年进行土地和水的改革的情景。当年在乌兹别克斯坦地主和大巴依被消灭了，六万六千无地和少地的农户分得土地、牲畜、农具、种子。灌溉系统也属于人民了。在这个斗争中，乌兹别克优秀的儿女留下不少可歌可泣的事迹。
    事情回到1925年。有一位不满二十三岁的青年于努索夫在塔什干附近指导土地和水的改革工作。霸占着水的巴依们企图贿赂他。他把巴依们的贿赂退还了。巴依们暗杀了他。当地人民在于努索夫的墓碑上留下这样几行字：“太阳是收获的父亲，水是收获的母亲。你斗争了，于努索夫同志，为了使水属于人民。我们发誓，要从杀人犯那里拿回水和太阳。”
    在“白金”国里
    乌兹别克俗话说：“一滴水，一把棉花。”这里土壤好，阳光充足，水又多，所以棉花也种得多。人们叫棉花做“白金”。它是这个共和国人民生活富裕的一个重要源泉。乌兹别克斯坦2，414个集体农庄当中，2，136个种棉花。在农村到处可以见到“百万富翁”。88％的集体农庄的收入在一百万卢布以上。
    在塔什干附近我们访问了一年现金收入近两千万卢布的卡冈诺维奇集体农庄。这个农庄是在1930年农庄集体化时期建立，后来又发展起来的，现在有740户，4，030人。
    接待我们的集体农庄主席土尔孙库洛夫，瘦长的六十五岁的乌兹别克人，胸前挂着两枚社会主义劳动英雄的金星。他在1935年来这里被选当主席，到现在已经当了二十一年主席，讲农庄的事真是如数家珍，他说，从前：这里是碱地缺水，只种220公顷棉花。现在，已经开垦了荒地，利用地势高低把水引进四公里，种了1，900公顷棉花。从前，土地操在两个巴依手里，愿种不愿种，随便摆布，把地糟蹋了；现在，1，540个劳动力同心协力，种地3，300公顷，发展着多种经济。1935年，只养110只羊，两头牛；现在养着一万四千头牲畜。1935年，每公顷土地产棉五公担，现在产棉三十多公担。从前，这里没有学校；现在有一个十年级学校、三个七年级学校和几个初级学校，有医院和无线电广播站。从前，个体农民生活很困难；现在，集体农庄一个劳动力一年从劳动日报酬中平均得到八千卢布和一千五百公斤粮食。
    种棉是卡冈诺维奇集体农庄的主要经济。从棉花平均产量来说，它属于共和国的先进集体农庄。庄员大会在春天讨论了苏共第二十次代表大会的总结和本庄在第六个五年计划中的任务，决定了在今年要比去年增产九百二十吨棉花，这就是说，要提高单位面积产量，从1，900公顷棉田里每公顷收摘三十二公担以上棉花。任务非同小可。庄员们的生产热情很高。全庄有二十八个种棉生产队，分八十四个种棉生产组。不少生产组保证每公顷产棉四十五公担，有三个生产组争取每公顷产棉七十公担。庄员们发掘着种种潜力。最主要的是在所有棉田上采用了正方形穴播和纵横行中耕的先进农作技术。这将大大提高单位面积产量并且节省约一半劳动量。
    在这个“白金”国土上的许多集体农庄里，都挂着乌兹别克共和国1954—1958年棉花发展的图表，那是根据苏共中央和苏联部长会议1954年2月的决定画的。图表指出：到1958年，共和国的棉花播种面积将达到145万公顷，总产量将达到420万吨。这里产棉量在1954年是299万吨，在1955年是330万吨，在1956年将为360万吨，每年差不多增长三十万吨。第六个五年计划规定这里产棉量在1960年约五百万吨，是可以达到的。怎样达到呢？乌兹别克共产党中央委员会农业部负责同志告诉我们：“除了开垦荒地，扩增棉田以外，最重要的是把落后的集体农庄提高为中等的集体农庄，把中等的集体农庄提高为先进的集体农庄。现在还有三分之一集体农庄每公顷土地产棉不到十五公担。如果把它们提高到中等水平，每年就可以增产三十多万吨棉花。”从乌兹别克科学院那里知道，现在乌兹别克共和国棉花平均产量每公顷二十二公担，个别集体农庄和生产组达到五十到七十公担。而较早采用正方形穴播方法的塔吉克共和国棉花平均产量每公顷二十六公担。可见乌兹别克斯坦棉花生产的发展还有无穷的可能性。
