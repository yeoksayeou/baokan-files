Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Soviet Union is the country with the richest forest resources in the world. According to TASS reporters from the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the total area of Soviet forests has now reached 1.069 billion hectares, accounting for about one-third of the world's forest area; timber reserves have reached 60 billion cubic meters. Each year, the natural growth of timber in the Soviet Union is 700 to 800 million cubic meters.

    The forest area of the Soviet Union will be further expanded during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period. In the next five years, the Soviet Union will carry out forest management work on 190 million hectares, and plant 3 million hectares of various economically valuable, fast-growing trees in different regions of the country. In addition, it is also planned to take measures to naturally regenerate forests on an area of 3.8 million hectares, and to plant large-scale protective forest belts in grassland areas, collective farms and state farm lands.

    In order to realize this plan, the Soviet Union will newly establish 1,973 mechanized forest farms during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period.

    森林资源在世界上最丰富
    总面积将近十亿七千万公顷
    新华社3日讯　苏联是世界上森林资源最丰富的国家。据塔斯社记者从苏联农业部获悉，现在，苏联的森林总面积已经达到十亿六千九百万公顷，约占世界森林面积的三分之一；木材蕴藏量达到六百亿立方公尺。每年，苏联的木材自然增长量为七亿到八亿立方公尺。
    苏联的森林面积在第六个五年计划期间将进一步扩大。今后五年间，苏联将要进行一亿九千万公顷的森林经理工作，并且在全国不同地区种植三百万公顷各种有经济价值的成长迅速的树木。此外，还计划采取措施，使三百八十万公顷面积上的森林自然更新，在草原地区、集体农庄和国营农场的土地上大规模植造防护林带。
    为了实现这个计划，在第六个五年计划期间，苏联将新建立一千九百七十三个机械化林场。
