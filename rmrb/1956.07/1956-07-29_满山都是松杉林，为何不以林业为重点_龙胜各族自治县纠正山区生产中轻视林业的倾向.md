Xinhua News Agency report: The vast mountains of Longsheng Autonomous County are almost entirely covered with pine and fir forests. Why isn't forestry production the focus of work here? This is the question recently raised by the Longsheng Autonomous County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Longsheng Autonomous County is located in northern Guangxi Province, with a total timber reserve of over three million cubic meters. Two years ago, the county proposed the working principle of prioritizing forestry and striving for self-sufficiency in grain. In the first half of this year, the county transferred three million jin of grain to other areas, marking the first time in history that grain was not only self-sufficient but also in surplus. However, some Yao and Miao farmers who rely on forestry for their livelihoods receive grain purchase certificates for 30 to 40 jin per month but have no money to buy rice. Currently, many agricultural and forestry cooperatives have weeded and fertilized rice paddies once or twice, while the weeds in the nurseries are taller than the seedlings. When drought disasters occur, the cooperatives often concentrate their efforts on irrigating and combating drought in fields planted with grain crops, while the newly planted young trees are left unattended. Almost all townships mistakenly rank forestry production as a sideline, with no one specifically responsible for management. Many rural grassroots cadres feel lost in their work. When they attend agricultural production meetings at higher-level leading organs, they are instructed that grain production is important; when they attend forestry meetings, they feel that forestry is important; and when they attend sideline production meetings, they are instructed that sideline production is important. They rarely have time to delve into reality and seriously study the local specific situation, only following the instructions of their superiors.

　　The above issues have already attracted the serious attention of the Longsheng Autonomous County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The County Committee recently decided that a deputy secretary of the County Committee and District Committee should be specifically responsible for forestry, and the Party branch secretaries of most townships must fully lead forestry production, develop diversified operations according to local conditions, comprehensively develop production, and resolutely correct the tendency of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting forestry in leading mountainous production. Currently, forestry meetings are being held in all townships across the county to improve various systems, requiring that the remaining issues of timber entering the cooperatives be resolved before August 10th; and that the management of forestry and forestry-farmer cooperatives be improved in late August.

    满山都是松杉林，为何不以林业为重点
    龙胜各族自治县纠正山区生产中轻视林业的倾向
    新华社讯　龙胜各族自治县的辽阔山野几乎被松杉林木掩盖遍了，这里的工作为什么却不是以林业生产为重点呢？这是中共龙胜各族自治县委员会在最近提出的问题。
    龙胜各族自治县在广西省北部，全县木材蕴藏量在三百万立方公尺以上。两年以前，这个县已提出了以林业为主，争取粮食自给的工作方针。今年上半年全县调往外地的粮食有三百万斤，历史上第一次粮食不但自给而且有余了。可是，有些靠林业生活的瑶、苗族农民，每月拿有三十到四十斤的购粮证，却无钱买米。现在，有很多农林结合社的水稻已进行了一两次的耘田追肥，而苗圃里的草却长得比树苗还高。逢到干旱灾害，社里往往是集中力量在种植粮食作物的田地里灌水抗旱，而刚刚栽种的幼林树苗却无人照管。几乎所有的乡都错误地把林业生产排列在副业以内，没有专人管理。很多农村基层干部感到工作上摸不着头脑。他们到上级领导机关参加农业生产会议，得到的指示是粮食生产重要；参加林业会议又感到林业重要；参加副业生产会议时，得到的指示却是副业生产重要。他们很少有工夫深入实际，认真研究当地具体情况，只有跟着上级指示跑。
    上述问题，已经引起中共龙胜各族自治县委员会的严重注意。县委最近决定，县委和区委由一副书记专管林业，大部分乡的党支部书记必须全力领导林业生产，因地制宜，开展多种经营，全面发展生产，切实纠正在领导山区生产中重农业轻林业的倾向。目前，全县各乡都在召开林业会议，健全各项制度，要求在八月十日前，处理好林木入社的遗留问题；在八月下旬搞好林业和林农结合社的经营管理。
