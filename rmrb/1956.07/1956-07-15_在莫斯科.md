    In Moscow
        Summer Skating
    In the sunny summer, on the boulevard leading to Moscow's Sokolniki Culture and Recreation Park, many people walk with ice skates in hand. Among them are young figure skating talents and world-renowned hockey teams.
    The Sokolniki summer ice rink is Moscow's third summer ice rink. The first was established in Dzerzhinsky Children's Park in 1951, covering an area of 120 square meters. Last year, a summer ice rink four times larger than the first was built on the "Young Pioneer" sports ground. Later, a third one appeared in Sokolniki, covering an area of 1,800 square meters. These artificial ice rinks are sturdy and simple in construction. Competitions can be held on the open-air ice rink in Sokolniki even on the hottest days, while the 6,000 spectators sitting in the stands are dressed in cool summer clothes.
    Now, Elektrostal is building an experimental summer ice rink. There are also summer ice rinks planned in Tbilisi's new sports building projects. The climate in Georgia is mild, and people living here can only see skating in movies, but soon they will have their own skating athletes.
        Beauty Techniques
    There is a large building on Chaplygina Street in Moscow, which is the Central Beauty Salon. Here, various facial defects can be compensated for. For example, Nadya, a female worker, had a flat nose, but the tip of her nose protruded like a button, so she was called "Little Button" since she was a child. This made Nadya very sad, but after cosmetic surgery, Nadya had a smooth and straight nose. A piece was missing from the chin of a college student named Vera, as if it had been cut off with a knife. After cosmetic surgery, a fake chin made of plastic with a color completely the same as real flesh was added under the skin of her chin.
    The Central Beauty Salon now widely uses plastic to replace porcelain, rubber, and ivory. For more than a hundred years, dentures and dental crowns have been made of porcelain and rubber. However, porcelain is very brittle and sometimes has a different color from real teeth; and rubber is easy to wear and tear and is harmful to the mucous membrane in the mouth. In order to overcome these shortcomings, Soviet experts have conducted many years of research and experiments and finally found a new method.
    Now it has been proven that plastic dentures and dental crowns are stronger and more hygienic than those made of porcelain and rubber, and the color is closer to real teeth and harmless to the human body. The Central Beauty Salon uses plastic not only to make dentures, but also to make fake facial flesh, fake ears, and fake noses.
        Meal Delivery
    At six or seven o'clock in the morning, on the quiet streets of Moscow, some people in white clothes are busy: they deliver hot bread, fresh milk, and semi-finished meat products to regular customers.
    In Moscow, this method has been widely welcomed. Now, hundreds of stores, bakeries, and milk farms deliver goods to regular customers' homes. "Bakery No. 524" alone serves six hundred households.
    The canteens in some cities in the Soviet Union can deliver not only simple breakfasts, but also hearty lunches and dinners to residents' homes. For example, the canteen in Orekhovo-Zuyevo has been delivering lunches or dinners to dormitories or homes in a timely manner according to customers' needs since last year.

    在莫斯科
        夏天溜冰
    阳光普照的夏天，在通往莫斯科索科尔尼科文化休息公园的林荫道上，走着很多拿着冰鞋的人。这些人里有青年花样滑冰能手，有世界闻名的曲棍球队。
    索科尔尼科的夏季冰场是莫斯科第三个夏季冰场。第一个是1951年在捷尔任斯基儿童公园建立的，面积有120平方公尺。去年在“少年先锋队员”运动场上修成了比第一个大四倍的夏季冰场。后来，在索科尔尼科又出现了第三个，面积达1800平方公尺。这些人造冰场很坚固，构造也很简单。在索科尔尼科的露天冰场上，可以在最热的天气里举行比赛，而这时坐在看台上的六千观众却穿着凉爽的夏装。
    现在，电钢城正在修建一个试验性的夏季冰场。在第比里斯的体育新建筑计划中也有夏季冰场。格鲁吉亚的气候温和，生活在这里的人只从电影上才能看到溜冰的人，可是不久他们就能有自己的溜冰健将了。
        美容有术
    在莫斯科交普雷街上有一座大楼，这就是中央美容院。这里能对人们脸上的各种缺陷进行弥补，例如，女工娜佳的鼻子很扁，可是鼻头却像按钮一样地突出来，因此从小就被人们叫作“小按钮”。这使娜佳很伤心，可是经过美容手术后，娜佳的脸上就出现了一个匀整笔直的鼻子。大学生维拉的下巴像被刀切了一样少了一块，经过美容手术，在下巴皮下又补上了用塑料制成的色泽完全和真肉一样的假下巴。
    中央美容院现在广泛利用塑料代替磁、橡胶和象牙。一百多年以来假牙和牙套都是用磁和橡胶做的。但是磁很脆，有时和真牙的色泽不一样；而橡胶则容易磨损，而且对口内粘液膜有害。为了克服这些缺点，苏联专家们进行了多年的研究实验终于找到了新办法。
    现在证明，塑料做的假牙和牙套要比磁和橡胶做的牢固，而且卫生，色泽也接近真牙，并且对人体无害。中央美容院利用塑料不仅制造假牙，而且还制造面部的假肉、假耳朵和假鼻子。
        送饭上门
    清晨六、七点钟，在莫斯科静静的街道上，一些穿着洁白衣服的人在奔忙着：他们把热腾腾的面包、新鲜的牛奶和肉类半制品分送给定户。
    在莫斯科，这种办法受到了普遍的欢迎。现在有好几百家商店、面包房和牛奶场往定户家里送东西。仅“524号”面包房就为六百户人家服务。
    苏联一些城市里的食堂，不只是简单的早餐，就是丰盛的午饭和晚饭也可以为居民送上门来。例如，奥列霍夫—祖也夫城的食堂，从去年起就根据顾客需要，及时地把午饭或晚饭送到宿舍或家里来。
