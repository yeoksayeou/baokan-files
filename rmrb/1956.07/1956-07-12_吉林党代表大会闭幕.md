Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 8th: The first Congress of the Communist Party of China, Jilin Province, was held in Changchun from June 29th to July 7th. The congress was attended by 690 delegates from the Han, Korean, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Xibe ethnic groups, representing 195,720 Communist Party members in Jilin Province.

    The meeting considered that Jilin Province is an important agricultural region, and many important industrial projects are being built in the province. The province's future production and construction tasks are arduous. Therefore, the meeting demanded that the development of industrial and agricultural production be the focus of the Party's leadership work. After analyzing the various favorable factors and difficulties in further developing production, the meeting emphasized that according to the province's economic conditions and the characteristics of different regions, agricultural production should be the main focus, while actively developing animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and special local products to increase commodity grain and export goods (soybeans, ginseng, deer antlers, etc.) to support national industrial construction and expand the supply of raw materials to local industries. At the same time, the meeting called for guiding the income distribution of agricultural cooperatives in accordance with the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, so as to increase the personal income of members on the basis of increasing production, strive to increase the income of 90% of the members, and ensure that the income of all members can increase year by year after several years.

    The meeting focused on analyzing and criticizing the adverse consequences of inappropriately emphasizing the implementation of the "one-chief system" in factories and enterprises in the Jilin area, which weakened the Party's leadership over enterprises. The meeting emphasized that the key to ensuring the realization of industrial construction and industrial production tasks is to adhere to the policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well, establish the idea of integrating increased output, improved quality, reduced costs, and safe production, and further conduct the advanced producer movement in a thorough and sustained manner.

    At the congress, Party democracy was promoted, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out from the bottom up, exposing and criticizing from all aspects the subjective and bureaucratic style of thinking of certain leading organs and leaders who were divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and did not care about the lives of the masses.

    The meeting also considered that conducting education on the Party's mass line among the personnel of Party and state organs throughout the province and strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological and theoretical education are constructive tasks to fundamentally improve the ideological awareness level of cadres and eliminate subjectivism, bureaucracy, and other undesirable tendencies.

    Finally, the congress elected a new Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, composed of thirty-five members, and also elected delegates to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
