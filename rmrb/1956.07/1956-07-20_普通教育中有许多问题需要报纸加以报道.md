    Many Problems in General Education Need to Be Reported by Newspapers
    The People's Daily still does not pay enough attention to reporting on education, especially on general education.

    Is it that there is nothing to report on in general education? Of course not. Many cadres still look down on education work, especially primary school education. Some agricultural cooperatives have dug up school playgrounds to plant rice, and occupied school buildings as warehouses or offices. Some Party organizations do not pay much attention to the political demands of middle and primary school teachers. Recently, chaos has reappeared in middle and primary schools (especially primary schools), with many units assigning work to schools at will, resulting in teachers working excessively long hours. Some leading departments do not pay attention to improving teachers' living and working conditions. These issues should all be raised by newspapers to attract attention from all parties and promote the resolution of these problems. (Liao Kui)

    普通教育中有许多问题需要报纸加以报道
    人民日报现在对报道教育方面、特别是普通教育方面的问题，还是不够重视。
    是不是普通教育没有什么可以报道的呢？当然不是。许多干部还轻视教育工作特别是小学教育工作。有的农业合作社挖了学校操场去种水稻，占用学校校舍做仓库或办公室，有的党组织不大关心中、小学教师的政治要求。最近以来，中、小学校（特别是小学）中又出现混乱现象，许多单位随便向学校布置工作，教师工作时间过长。有些领导部门不注意改善教师的生活条件和工作条件。这些，报纸都应该提出来，以引起各方面的重视，推动这些问题的解决。　（廖葵）
