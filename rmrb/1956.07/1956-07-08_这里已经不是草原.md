    “This is No Longer a Prairie”

    “……………………………
    Young men and women go to the wasteland every morning,
    The face of the wasteland changes day by day.
    Now this is the Urnek Farm,
  　This is no longer a prairie!”
    On the evening of June 11th, at a soiree in a state-owned farm in the Kustanai Oblast of northern Kazakhstan, Soviet Union, we heard a young woman recite this with a clear voice.
    The young people of this farm have reclaimed 23,400 hectares of virgin land here.
    Since the reclaimers came, this large tract of land has had its name—Urnek State Farm. “Urnek,” in Kazakh, means “flower carpet.” People want to make the wasteland as beautiful as a colorful carpet!
    Comrade Pliaksin, the farm director, told us: "Our achievement is to make people fall in love with this land—a wasteland where nothing existed in the past."
    People have fallen in love with this land, which is the result of hard work and the result of fighting against numerous difficulties.
    On April 6, 1954, the farm director, chief engineer, chief agronomist, accountant, architect, and other eleven people, bearing the glorious mission given to them by the state, carrying the Party's hopes for them, came to this wasteland with tents. Soon, on April 26, the first batch of volunteer reclaimers, 56 Muscovites, also arrived here.
    At that time, in front of people, there was still an endless desolate land; however, in people's imagination, it was no longer a wasteland. The farm director reported to everyone "what our farm will look like in the future." People acted according to their beautiful ideals.
    Construction requires stone. In mid-May, two youth work teams were organized to quarry stone 35 kilometers away. Many building materials were at Kustanai Station, 200 kilometers away, and another youth work team led by Apra Minkov transported them day and night.
    On June 1st, another youth work team was organized. It included several typists who originally worked in the Moscow Soviet Ministry of Education, some female workers who originally worked in sewing factories, and some fitters who originally worked in machine manufacturing factories. They went to Tugsak, 110 kilometers away, to make bricks. Without machines, they mainly operated by hand. Eighteen girls, two boys, made 500,000 bricks in three months. Every Sunday, they also returned to the construction headquarters to participate in voluntary labor.
    In late May, the first batch of tractors and agricultural machinery arrived. A tractor work team was immediately formed. According to the task assigned, in the first year, this farm had to reclaim 20,000 hectares of wasteland and trial-plant 100 hectares. The tractor work team worked hard on the hard wasteland intertwined with grass roots and actually reclaimed 22,000 hectares. According to regulations, a tractor work team should reclaim 2,500 hectares in one reclamation season. The work team led by Captain Vi Yelin actually reclaimed 5,012 hectares this season, ranking first in the entire Soviet Union. When the first batch of cultivated land was reclaimed, they seized the time to plant as much as possible, planting 1,100 hectares—ten times more than the original task.
    Young people are determined to settle down here. On June 15, the first wedding was held on the new land. Ratnikov (originally a fitter, now a driver) from Moscow and Konikova (originally worked in the Moscow Post Office, now works in the vegetable garden) got married. From then until now, more than ninety young couples have gotten married here.
    The number of people coming to the wasteland is constantly increasing. The most difficult problem is that there are not enough houses to live in. The farm called on workers to use their spare time to build personal houses (the farm provides loans and supplies building materials such as wood and cement). Houses appeared one after another. However, the tractor drivers were busy reclaiming wasteland in the fields day and night and had no time to build their own houses. Seeing that the autumn wind would soon blow, what should be done? At a Communist Youth League meeting, the deputy secretary of the grass-roots League organization, the young construction site director Koniukhov, proposed: to build personal houses for tractor drivers. Various youth work teams used their time outside of the eight-hour work day to build more than a dozen houses for tractor drivers and other busy people. They used their spare time to build a "Communist Youth League Street."
    Between August and September, the first wheat was harvested on this wasteland, yielding 9 quintals per hectare (equivalent to 120 catties per mu). The harvest was not very large, but it should not be forgotten that people only came to this desolate land in April!
    The October Revolution Festival this year was a particularly memorable and joyful festival for the people of Urnek Farm. This is not only a festival to commemorate the October Revolution, but also a festival to celebrate their first harvest on the wasteland, and a festival to celebrate their great achievements in construction on the wasteland. The primary school on the wasteland has been built, and the children have started classes. The hospital on the wasteland has begun to work. On the day of the October Revolution Festival, the State Farm Department awarded them a bonus of 30,000 rubles for the farm's particularly good wasteland reclamation and construction achievements. The farm’s radio station was also installed by two demobilized sailors who had just come to work on the wasteland. The sound of Moscow resounded across the wasteland; if necessary, people could also contact Kustanai City by radio from here, and talk to relatives in the city; if there was a serious illness that the small hospital on the wasteland could not cure, a telegram could be sent to Kustanai, and a rescue plane could fly in quickly. On the new land, in the new club built by the young people through voluntary labor, new bands and choruses, and dance groups held the first concert on the October Revolution Festival to celebrate this victorious festival, this harvest festival. Comrade Famichov, the secretary of the farm’s Communist Youth League organization, told us: "That day, we suddenly felt very close to Moscow again!"
    In the first year of construction, the old state-owned farm helped this newly born farm; in the second year, this young farm used its great strength to help even younger farms. They were the first in the entire state to complete the 1955 spring sowing task. In early June, their tractor work team went to help four new farms reclaim wasteland, 400 kilometers away. In the hot weather, under various difficult conditions, they reclaimed 16,000 hectares of wasteland for these four "little brothers" in one and a half months. When they returned to their own farm, they were again busy preparing for the harvest.
    This year, the most disappointing thing was the drought—a major drought that occurs only once every ten to twelve years. However, even in the case of drought, it has been proven that good management of newly reclaimed land can result in a good harvest. This year, Urnek Farm harvested 61,000 quintals of wheat on more than 20,000 hectares of land.
    The farm began to establish animal husbandry, but it happened to encounter a very cold winter. Forage had to be transported from distant fields to the livestock farm in heavy snow. It was necessary to keep the livestock sheds clean and constantly clear the snow outside the livestock sheds. Protecting livestock through the winter became the most arduous task. The Communist Youth League organization sent more than 20 of its best members to participate in animal husbandry. The young people's enthusiasm overcame the severe cold, and more than 300 cattle and nearly 600 sheep safely survived the winter.
    1956 has begun. The third year of life on the new land has begun.
    According to the plan, the spring sowing area this year is 22,715 hectares, of which 20,400 hectares are spring wheat; the actual sowing area is 22,926 hectares, of which 21,430 hectares are spring wheat. In just over a year, the technical level of farm workers has been greatly improved. Many people have completed twice the amount of work as last year.
    The farm is constantly adding new strength. Up to now, there are 960 workers and staff members in the entire farm, 730 households, and a total population of nearly 2,000 people. These people include 21 nationalities and come from 39 states; most of them come from cities and industrial enterprises, and most of them are Muscovites.
    In early January 1955, at a meeting of young Moscow volunteers who came to reclaim wasteland, Comrade Khrushchev said: "As the saying goes, Moscow was not built all at once. You must settle down properly, not only set an example in production (of course, this is the main thing), but also set an example in life. You should bring your urban culture to the grassland, so that others can see at a glance that the people living here are from Moscow and are living in an orderly manner."
    The people who came to the grassland are doing just that. People are proving with their actions: the people living here are from Moscow, from many big cities and old farms, and are happy, joyful, and cultured people.
    There is a women's work team here, and the captain, Lida Grebneva, is a graduate of the Moscow Horticultural Secondary Technical School and once participated in the work of greening Gorky Street in Moscow. They love the newly reclaimed land as much as they love the capital Moscow. They are responsible for planting orchards and corn; in a few years, they will be able to let the people on the new land eat delicious cherries and apples. Her horticultural skills are definitely not wasted, and there is enough room to display her talents in the wasteland. In the area where there are several birch forests, several parks and dance halls will soon be built.
    There are neat streets and neat houses here. Many windows and eaves have beautiful decorations, and even the roof tiles are covered with red and white alternating patterns, like a chessboard. Each house has exquisite furniture, clean white curtains and tablecloths, flower pots and vases full of business, and family photos hanging on the walls. Those from Ukraine are also decorated with beautiful lace that the Ukrainian people especially love.
    Even in the field camps of the tractor work teams, there are radios, record players, accordions, chess, newspapers, magazines, volleyball courts, and exquisite and clean dining rooms. People have not forgotten to put a few bottles of fresh flowers and hang a few colorful paintings here.
    There has been a library since July 1954. Now, there are more than 500 copies of newspapers and periodicals subscribed to by workers and staff members alone. The farm has its own printing house and publishes the beautifully printed newspaper "The Road to Communism."
    There is already a seven-year school here, and the children of the workers are receiving regular education.
    In the delivery room of the small hospital, 221 babies had been born by the time we left there. …
    Everything has just begun. Only two years have passed from April 1954 to now.
    I asked an old worker about his thoughts on their future life, and he replied without hesitation: "What are you thinking about? Of course, future life will be better!"
    On the afternoon of June 14, we flew from Kustanai to Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic. Looking down from the plane, everywhere on the Kazakh steppe was reclaimed land—large green and brown squares, and new buildings everywhere.—Large red and white buildings. In Almaty, Comrade Zhulin, the Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, told us: In the Kazakh Republic, 18 million hectares of wasteland were reclaimed in 1954 and 1955. The reclamation work has not stopped, and another 1.3 million hectares have been reclaimed this spring. In 1953, the total sown area in the republic was only 9.7 million hectares; this year, it has reached 27.5 million hectares.
    Comrade Zhulin said: "From 1939 to 1941, I also worked in Kustanai Oblast. At that time, the cultivated land area in Kustanai Oblast was only 40 hectares; this year, the sown area in this state has reached 4.7 million hectares. At that time, this state only produced 7 to 8 million poods of grain a year; this year, this state can harvest 300 million poods of grain and deliver 150 million poods of grain to the state. Judging from the growth of crops this year, I think there will be more. How much the wasteland reclamation has changed the face of our country's agriculture can be understood by looking at these figures."
    In front of my eyes, the scenery of the earth seen on the plane seemed to reappear. The Kazakh steppe is turning into huge and beautiful carpets, producing large quantities of grain and cattle and sheep. It is no longer a desolate prairie.

    “这里已经不是草原”

    “……………………………
    青年男女每天早晨到荒地上去
    荒地的面貌一天一天改变。
    现在这里是乌尔涅克农场，
  　这里已经不是草原！”
    六月十一日夜晚，在苏联哈萨克共和国北部库斯坦奈州的一个国营农场的晚会上，我们听到一个女青年用爽朗的声音这样朗诵。
    这个农场的青年已经在这里开垦了二万三千四百公顷生荒地。
    这一大片土地，从开垦者来了以后，就有了它的名字——国营乌尔涅克农场。“乌尔涅克”，按照哈萨克文，意思是“花地毯”。人们要把荒地变得像彩色的地毯那样美丽！
    场长普利亚兴同志告诉我们：“我们的成就，就是使人们爱上了这块土地——过去什么都没有的荒地。”
    人们爱上了这块土地，这是辛勤劳动的结果，是同重重困难斗争的结果。
    1954年4月6日，场长和总工程师、总农艺师、会计师、建筑师等十二个人，担负着国家给予他们的光荣任务，带着党对他们的希望，带着帐篷到这片荒地上来了。不久，四月二十六日，到这里的第一批志愿垦荒者，五十六个莫斯科人也来了。
    那时候，在人们的面前，还是无边的荒凉的大地；可是，在人们的想像中，它已经不再是荒地了。场长向大家报告了“我们的农场将来是什么样子”。人们按照自己的美好理想行动起来。
    建筑，需要石料。五月中旬，两个青年工作队组织起来了，到三十五公里以外的地方去采石。许多建筑材料都在二百公里以外的库斯坦奈车站，由阿普拉明可夫领导的另一个青年工作队日夜不停地运着。
    六月一日，又一个青年工作队组织起来了。里面有原来在莫斯科苏联教育部工作的几个打字员，有原来在缝纫工厂工作的一些女工，有原来在机器制造厂工作的钳工。她们到一百一十公里以外的土谷沙克去造砖。没有机器，主要用手工操作。十八个姑娘，两个小伙子，三个月造了五十万块砖。每个星期日，她们还回到建设场部的地方，参加义务劳动。
    五月下旬，第一批拖拉机和农业机器来了。立即组成了拖拉机工作队。按照规定的任务，第一年，这个农场要开荒二万公顷，试播一百公顷。拖拉机工作队在草根盘结着的坚硬的荒地上奋力工作着，实际上开垦了二万二千公顷。按照规定，一个拖拉机工作队一个开荒季度应当开荒二千五百公顷。队长维也林领导的工作队，这一季度实际上开荒五千零十二公顷，在全苏占第一位。他们在第一批耕地开垦出来的时候就赶时间尽可能多播种，种了一千一百公顷——超过原定任务十倍。
    年轻人决心在这里成家立业。六月十五日，在新地上举行了第一次婚礼。从莫斯科来的拉特尼可夫（原来是钳工，现在是司机）和柯尼可娃（原来在莫斯科邮局工作，现在在菜园工作）结了婚。从那时候到现在，这里已经有九十多对青年结了婚。
    到荒地来的人不断增加着。最困难的问题是房子不够住。场部号召工人利用业余时间建筑个人住宅（由农场贷款，并且供给木材、水泥等建筑材料）。住宅一座一座出现了。可是，拖拉机手日夜在田野里紧张地开荒，没有时间建筑自己的住宅。眼看不久就要刮起秋风来了，怎么办呢？在一次团员大会上，基层团组织的副书记、年轻的工地主任科纽霍夫提议：替拖拉机手建筑个人住宅。各个青年工作队利用八小时工作以外的时间为拖拉机手和别的工作繁忙的人建筑了十几所住宅。他们用业余的时间建成了一条“共青团街”。
    八九月间，在这片荒地上，第一次收获了小麦，每公顷九公担（合每亩一百二十市斤）。收获量不算太大，可是，不能忘记，人们是四月间才来到这片荒无人烟的土地上的啊！
    这一年的十月革命节，对于乌尔涅克农场的人们是一个特别值得回忆的欢乐的大节日。这不只是纪念十月革命的节日，也是庆祝他们在荒地上的第一次收获的节日，还是庆祝他们在荒地上进行建设的巨大成就的节日。荒地上的小学已经建成，孩子们已经开始上课。荒地上的医院已经开始工作。在十月革命节那一天，为了这个农场的开荒成绩和建筑成绩特别好，国营农场部发给了他们三万卢布奖金。农场里的无线电站也正好在这时候由新来荒地工作的两个复员的水兵装好了。荒原上响起了莫斯科的声音；如果有必要的话，人们还可以从这里同库斯坦奈城用无线电联系，同城市里的亲人通话；有荒地上的小医院治不了的急病，发个电报到库斯坦奈，很快就可以有救护飞机飞来。在新地上，在青年们用义务劳动修建成的新的俱乐部里，新的乐队和合唱队、舞蹈组，在十月革命节举行了第一次音乐会，庆祝这胜利的节日、收获的节日。农场青年团组织书记法米乔夫同志告诉我们：“那一天，我们忽然觉得又离莫斯科很近了！”
    建场第一年，老的国营农场曾经帮助了这个新诞生的农场；这个年幼的农场，第二年就用巨大的力量去帮助更年幼的农场了。他们在全州各个农场中第一个完成了1955年的春播任务。六月初，他们的拖拉机工作队就全体出动，到四百公里以外的地方去，帮助四个新农场开荒。炎热的天气，在种种困难的条件下，一个半月，为这四个“小弟弟”开荒一万六千公顷。回到自己的农场来，就又紧张地准备进行收割。
    这一年，最使人失望的事情是天气干旱——每十年到十二年才遇到一次的大旱。不过，就是在干旱的情况下，也证明了新垦地经营得好就可以有不坏的收成。这一年，乌尔涅克农场在二万多公顷土地上收获了六万一千公担小麦。
    农场开始建立饲畜业，偏偏碰上了一个非常冷的冬天。饲草要冒着大雪从很远的田间运到饲畜场。既要保持畜棚内的清洁，又要不断清除畜棚外面的积雪。保护牲畜过冬成了最艰苦的工作。青年团组织派了二十多个最优秀的团员参加饲畜业。青年们的热情战胜了严寒，三百多头牛、近六百头羊安全地度过了冬天。
    1956年开始了。新地上第三年的生活开始了。
    按照计划，今年春播面积是22，715公顷，其中有春小麦20，400公顷；实际播种面积是22，926公顷，其中有春小麦21，430公顷。一年多的时间，农场工人们的技术水平已经大大提高。许多人完成了两倍于去年的工作量。
    农场还在不断增加新的力量。到现在，全场已经有工人职员九百六十人，七百三十户人家，居民总数近两千人。这些人包括二十一个民族，来自三十九个州；大半是从城市、从工业企业来的，其中最多的是莫斯科人。
    1955年1月初，在莫斯科青年志愿开垦者的会议上，赫鲁晓夫同志这样说过：“俗话说得好，莫斯科也不是一下子建筑起来的。必须要好好地安居下来，不仅要在生产问题上（当然，这是主要的）作出榜样，而且要在生活问题上作出榜样。应当把自己的城市文化带到草原上去，让旁人一下子就可以看出来，这里住的是莫斯科搬来的人，住得井井有条。”
    到草原上来的人们正是这样做的。人们在用行动证明：这里住的是莫斯科人，是从许多大城市和老农场来的人，是幸福的、愉快的、有文化教养的人。
    这里有一个妇女工作队，队长丽达·格列布尼娃是莫斯科园艺中等技术学校毕业的，在莫斯科曾经参加过绿化高尔基大街的工作。她们像热爱首都莫斯科一样热爱着新垦地。她们负责种植果园和玉米；要不了几年，就可以使新地上的人们吃到鲜美的樱桃和苹果。她的园艺技术决没有白学，在荒地上有足够的发挥她的才能的余地。在几片白桦林所在的地方，不久就要修建起来几个公园和舞场。
    这里有整齐的街道，整齐的房屋。许多窗子和屋檐有美丽的装饰，连屋瓦也盖成红白交错的图案，像国际象棋的棋盘。每个房子里都有精美的家具、洁白的窗帘和台布，充满生意的花盆和花瓶，墙上挂着一家人的照片。从乌克兰来的，还装饰着乌克兰人民特别喜爱的美丽的花边。
    连拖拉机工作队的田间野营里，也有收音机、留声机、手风琴、象棋、报纸、杂志、排球场，也有精美清洁的餐室，人们也没有忘记在这里放上几瓶鲜花，挂上几幅彩画。
    从1954年7月，就有了图书馆。现在，只是工人职员个人订阅的报纸刊物，就有五百多份。农场有自己的印刷所，出版着印刷精美的报纸“共产主义之路”。
    这里已经有了七年制学校，工人们的子女受着正规的教育。
    在小医院的产房里，到我们离开那里的时候为止，已经诞生了二百二十一个婴儿。……
    一切只不过刚刚开始。从1954年4月到现在，才两年的时间。
    我问一个老工人对他们未来的生活的想法，他不假思索地回答：“想些什么呢？将来的生活当然会变得更好！”
    六月十四日下午，我们乘飞机从库斯坦奈飞向哈萨克共和国的首府阿拉木图。从飞机上往下看，在哈萨克大草原上，到处是开垦过的土地——一大片又一大片绿色的、褐色的方块，到处是新建筑的房舍。——一大片又一大片红色的、白色的建筑。在阿拉木图，哈萨克共产党中央委员会第二书记茹林同志告诉我们：在哈萨克共和国，1954年、1955年开垦了一千八百万公顷荒地。开荒工作并没有停止，今年春天，又开垦了一百三十万公顷。1953年，全共和国播种面积才九百七十万公顷；今年，已经达到二千七百五十万公顷。
    茹林同志说：“从1939年到1941年，我也在库斯坦奈州工作过。那时候，库斯坦奈州的耕地面积才四十公顷；今年，这个州的播种面积已经达到四百七十万公顷。那时候，这个州一年才生产七百到八百万普特粮食；今年，这个州可以收获三亿普特粮食，要交给国家一亿五千万普特粮食。从今年庄稼生长的情况看，我想，一定会更多。开荒给我国的农业面貌带来了多大的变化，把这些数字一看就明白了。”
    在我眼前，仿佛又出现了在飞机上看到的大地的景色。哈萨克的大草原，在变成一块又一块巨大的美丽的地毯；它在大量生产着谷物和牛羊，它已经不再是荒芜的草原了。
