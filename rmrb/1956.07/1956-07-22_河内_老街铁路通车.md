Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 20th: The General Bureau of Railways of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced that the 296-kilometer Hanoi-Lao Cai railway has begun operations today.

	This railway is the third railway restored by the Vietnamese people since the restoration of peace in Vietnam. The previous two railways were the railway from Hanoi to Friendship Pass on the Chinese border and the railway from Hanoi to Nam Dinh.

	The Hanoi-Lao Cai railway restoration project began on March 17 last year. The 155-kilometer Hanoi-Yen Bai section was restored and opened to traffic as early as the end of March this year.

	The Hanoi-Lao Cai railway is an important railway diagonally traversing northwestern Vietnam. It connects Lao Cai City, an important town near the Chinese border, with Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, passing through the five provinces of Bac Ninh, Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai, and passing through important towns such as Vinh Yen, Viet Tri, Phu Tho, and Yen Bai. After the restoration and opening of this railway, it will bring great benefits to the construction of northwestern Vietnam, the exchange of materials between the northwest region and the Red River Delta region, and the lives of the people in the provinces along the line.

    河内—老街铁路通车
    新华社河内20日电　越南民主共和国铁路总局宣布，长达二百九十六公里的河内——老街铁路今天已经开始通车。
    这条铁路是越南人民从越南和平恢复以来修复的第三条铁路。前两条铁路是从河内到中国边界上的睦南关的铁路和从河内到南定的铁路。
    河内——老街铁路的修复工程是在去年三月十七日开始的。其中长一百五十五公里的河内——安沛段早在今年三月底修复通车。
    河内——老街铁路是一条斜贯越南西北部的重要铁路，它连接着邻近中国边境的重镇老街市和越南首都河内，沿途穿过北宁、永福、富寿、安沛、老街五省，中经永安、越池、富寿、安沛等重要城镇。这条铁路修复通车后，对越南西北的建设和西北地区同红河三角洲地区的物资交流以及对沿线各省人民的生活，都将带来很大好处。
