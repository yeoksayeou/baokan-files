Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, 10th — Three work teams have recently departed from Shigatse City in Tibet to carry out work in Lhatse Dzong, Sakya, and Xietongmen Manor.

These three work teams are composed of technicians and medical personnel drawn from various Shigatse City government offices, as well as young Tibetan cadres who have just returned from studying at the Central University for Nationalities. After arriving at their long-term work locations, they will publicize the resolutions of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and ethnic policies, assist local people in establishing schools, building water conservancy projects, repairing bridges and flood control projects, and provide free medical treatment to the Tibetan people.

In order to better assist the Tibetan people in construction and publicize various policies, in the second half of this year, the Shigatse Sub-Committee of the CPC Tibet Working Committee will also send ten work teams to the main dzongs and manors in the Shigatse area to settle down for long periods.

    日喀则派工作队长期下乡
    新华社日喀则10日电　三个工作队最近已经分别从西藏的日喀则市出发到拉孜宗、萨迦和谢通门溪卡等地开展工作。
    这三个工作队由日喀则市各机关抽调的技术人员、医务人员和刚由中央民族学院学习回来的藏族青年干部等组成。他们下到长期工作的地点后，将宣传西藏自治区筹备委员会的各项决议和民族政策，帮助当地人民开办学校、兴修水利、整修桥梁和防洪工程，并免费为藏族人民治病。
    为了更好的帮助西藏人民进行建设，和宣传各项政策，今年下半年，中共西藏工委日喀则分工委还要派十个工作队到日喀则地区各主要宗和溪卡，长时期的定居下来。
