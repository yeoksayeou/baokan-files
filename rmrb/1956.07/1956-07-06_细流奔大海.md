    Small Streams Flow to the Sea
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Han Beiping
    In a village in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, inhabited by Han, Tibetan, and Hui people, an event worthy of attention occurred.
    This village is Madang Village, in Yashou Township, Third District of Xiahe County. It is located on a hillside in the Daxia River valley. The low houses and grey-ochre earth walls, the thin and arid land, and the mountains surrounding the village, show that this village is not outstanding, perhaps even slightly impoverished; however, the imposing monastery on the opposite bank of the Daxia River, stretching into a continuous complex, is quite magnificent.
    One day in May 1953, a short, forty-something man came to Madang Village from the Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Wangatan. His name was Kong Qingde, a cadre from the district, who came to Yashou Township to promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The district party secretary repeatedly instructed him that he must work carefully and patiently, explaining the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation and the difficulties in promoting it in minority areas, only allowing him to do well and not to do badly. Kong Qingde, with excitement and tension, settled down in the township government.
    People heard that he was coming to engage in mutual aid and cooperation. Some were happy, some held skeptical attitudes, and perhaps some secretly opposed it. There was no term for mutual aid and cooperation in the Tibetan language, but after propaganda, they could understand what it was all about. Everyone was waiting, but Kong Qingde considered it discreetly.
    The Yashou Township government was located in Madang Village. In principle, this village should have been the "first to benefit from its proximity to the water." However, after Kong Qingde studied the situation, he found that the whole village had only twenty-two households, with only ninety-two people including the old and the young. The land was not much, and draught animals were scarce. In addition, it was inhabited by three ethnic groups, making the situation complex and difficult to handle. Therefore, he preferred to travel ten miles back and forth every day to Yadang Village to establish mutual aid teams. Yadang Village had horses and cattle and was relatively wealthy, so it would be easier to get things done. Strangely enough, Kong Qingde devoted himself wholeheartedly to working in Yadang Village. He was like a magnet. When he went, he united the people in mutual aid teams and worked enthusiastically. When he left, it was like taking the magnet away, and the mutual aid teams immediately stopped. What was going on? Kong Qingde couldn't help but feel confused.
    While Kong Qingde was walking ten miles of mountain roads every day and still frowning at night, a thirty-something Tibetan woman from Madang Village named Zhou Lao was carefully observing him.
    Zhou Lao and her husband, Losang, were poor Tibetan farmers from Yadang Village. The whole family of seven had very little land. Before liberation, life was extremely hard, and Losang had to go out and do hard labor every year to earn a small income to support the family. In 1950, Losang joined the People's Liberation Army and was then transferred to work elsewhere. Zhou Lao took care of the children alone and farmed at home. When she heard that mutual aid and cooperation were to be carried out in her township, she looked forward to it with joy, thinking that things would be better now. Who knew that Kong Qingde would leave the Madang Village right in front of him and painstakingly go to Yadang Village to work? She thought to herself that this was a strange thing. Her eldest daughter, Chaimujia, noticed that her mother wanted to question him several times, and this member of the Communist Youth League (she is now the deputy secretary of the Youth League branch in the township) supported her mother. The mother's courage grew, and one day she found Kong Qingde and asked him, "Madang Village is close to the township government. Are you not engaging in mutual aid and cooperation here because you are snobbish?"
    These words rescued Kong Qingde from his confusion. He couldn't get things done in Yadang Village, where people had more cattle and horses and were richer, but the farmers in Madang Village were striving to do it. The district party secretary had told him about the principle of who to rely on and who to unite with in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and he suddenly remembered everything. He turned around, re-examined the situation in Madang Village, and helped Zhou Lao establish the first Tibetan mutual aid team in the Tibetan area. Zhou Lao was elected as the leader of the mutual aid team.
    This mutual aid team was a banner. Since it was a banner, it inevitably had to fight against wind and rain; and precisely because it was a banner, it still stood tall and fluttered after fighting against the wind and rain.
    Zhou Lao's mutual aid team started with seven households, but later Suonangji withdrew, leaving only six households. Suonangji was relatively wealthy and had a pair of oxen. At that time, he proposed that if he were to participate, his disabled daughter must also be counted as a full laborer. This was somewhat coercive, and the team could not accept it, so he withdrew. The mutual aid team of six households persisted until this year. Although it has experienced many setbacks, it has finally gained a firm foothold. Now, they have not only explored a set of methods to increase production, established a learning system, and expanded the organization—from six households to nineteen households—but also, their socialist consciousness has been raised, and this mutual aid team already has the rudimentary form of an agricultural production cooperative.
    Six households working and producing together, due to the large number of people and greater strength, the output has significantly increased. For example, on a barren land with only seven dan and one dou of seeds (each six sheng of seeds is about one mu), the total output in 1954 was 9,100 jin, and in 1955 it was 14,700 jin, an increase of more than 60%. Tibetan farmers, whose production technology has always been behind that of Han farmers in the same village, have unprecedentedly surpassed them. This "surpassing" is not a simple "surpassing," but a great shining of light. When Tibetan farmers farmed individually, some could hardly recover their seeds, but now every household has a bumper harvest; in the past, they were not able to feed themselves every year, and they had to rely on borrowing and relief to avoid starvation, but last year these six households sold 350 jin of surplus grain (qingke). Don't underestimate this small number, which is not enough for one person's annual rations. However, this is the great beginning from self-sufficiency to surplus, a victory that the mutual aid team can boast about. Don't underestimate the small scale of this mutual aid team, but its actions in this area have shown the great power of breaking old habits and establishing new rules. For example, in the past, the land was not plowed after the autumn harvest, and a few families occasionally plowed it once, but now the land within the team is generally plowed twice. In the past, cow dung was used for firewood, but now it is stipulated to be used as fertilizer; as for the fuel problem, women solve it by picking firewood during the winter slack season. The firewood they picked back last winter is enough to burn for a year. The men burn charcoal during the winter slack season, and the income of only three men reaches 950 yuan. Many crops that have never been planted, such as vegetables and alfalfa, are now planted. The past cultivation methods were extensive, mainly broadcasting, but now they have been changed to mixing seeds and strip planting.
    At the same time, due to the advocacy and leadership of the mutual aid team, things that people had longed for for many years but could not realize have now been accomplished. Madang Village is located at a high altitude, and the clear water of the Daxia River flows past it day and night, but it cannot be used for irrigation. People have to draw water from Yashou Gully. The amount of gully water is not much, and when four villages draw water, the amount of water becomes even more insufficient. Some fields have to watch the drought, and the seedlings wither and lose their harvest. These four villages have fought over water, killed people, and formed feuds. After the mutual aid team was established, it advocated repairing ditches, and the respected Tibetan elder Ebu Jing came forward to persuade those who were skeptical and opposed it. They also received government loans and technical assistance. The water channel, six li long, with several tunnels, was finally repaired. The water from the Daxia River was continuously transported over. The water flowed noisily, and people laughed happily. This was an unprecedented joyful event!
    This January, after Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was delivered to this remote area, people's enthusiasm became even higher, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement vigorously developed. This mutual aid team was called "the cellar of the village" by the Tibetans (meaning that it is the foundation) and absorbed Han and Hui farmers, forming an ethnic joint team. Suonangji, who had withdrawn before, also voluntarily requested to return.
    After the establishment of the ethnic joint team, a more detailed plan was drawn up. In addition to agricultural reforms, we only need to look at their arrangements for sideline occupations and public undertakings to see their advanced spirit. They have opened up an orchard, planting 163 apple and pear trees, plants that have never been grown in Madang Village or even in this area. They raise 74 sheep. They planted 4,843 poplar and willow trees on roadsides, watersides, and hillsides, averaging 134.5 trees per laborer, many of which were transported back from more than a hundred li away.
    Before liberation, the residents of the three ethnic groups in this small village did not interact with each other. There was a popular saying at the time: "Madang lives in eighteen families, no family visits another family's door." Now, residents of the three ethnic groups are working harmoniously in one team.
    After nearly three years of persistence, the members of this team deeply realized the great benefits of mutual aid and cooperation and urgently requested to transfer to a cooperative. They solved the issue of temple land encountered in establishing cooperatives in minority areas reasonably, allowing farmers to continue to rent and cultivate the land, but reducing the rent. The living Buddha Madang Cang of Chazha Temple said, "You have only built the surrounding walls and erected the pillars, but the beams and rafters have not been put up, and they cannot shelter from the wind and rain; to shelter from the wind and rain, you must build a cooperative. Madang Village is my natal home, and I will be happy if you build a cooperative sooner!" From the living Buddha's words, it can be imagined that their relationship is very good. Now, this team has submitted an application to the district for the transfer to a cooperative.
    The mutual aid team of the three ethnic groups in Madang Village is just a small stream in the surging high tide of agricultural cooperativization across the country. However, like the Daxia River water flowing in front of their village, no matter how far the road is and how dangerous the shoals are, it always moves forward, merging with the rapid currents of the Yellow River and flowing to the sea. The power of socialism is unstoppable.

    细流奔大海
    本报特约记者　韩北屏
    在甘南藏族自治州一个汉、藏、回三族共居的村子里，发生了一件引人注意的事情。
    这个村子，是夏河县第三区牙首乡的马当村。它位于大夏河河谷的山坡上。那些低矮的房屋和灰赭色的土墙，那些瘦瘠干旱的土地，那些围绕着村子的大山，显示这个村子不很出色，也许还微露些贫穷；倒是傲踞在大夏河对岸的喇嘛寺院，连成一片，相当巍峨。
    1953年五月的某一天。一个矮小的四十多岁的男子，从中共第三区区委会所在地完尕滩来到马当村。他的名字叫孔庆德，是区上的干部，到牙首乡来搞互助合作运动的。区委书记一再嘱咐他，互助合作有什么好处，在少数民族地区推行有什么困难，必须细致而耐心地去工作，只许做好不能做坏。孔庆德带着兴奋而紧张的心情，在乡政府住下了。
    人们听说他来搞互助合作，有的喜欢，有的抱着怀疑的态度，说不定暗中还有人反对。藏族同胞的语言里，没有互助合作这个名词，但是经过宣传，他们也能了解是怎末一回事。大家期待着，孔庆德却不露声色地考虑着。
    牙首乡乡政府就在马当村，照理说，这个村子应该是“近水楼台先得月”的，可是孔庆德研究了一下，全村只有二十二户，连老带小只有九十二个人，土地不多，耕畜缺乏，再加上还是三个民族共居，条件复杂不好办。于是，他宁可每天来回走十里路，到牙当村去搞互助组。牙当村有马有牛，比较富有，搞起来想必容易。说也奇怪，孔庆德全心全意在牙当村搞工作，他像吸铁石似地，他去了，把人们团结在互助组一起，干得挺起劲，他走了，也像吸铁石拿开了，互助组马上就停下来。这是怎末回事？孔庆德不免困惑起来。
    就在孔庆德一天走十来里山路，到晚上还愁眉不展的时候，马当村一个三十多岁的藏族妇女名叫周老的，却非常注意地观察着他。
    周老和她的丈夫洛桑，本是牙当村贫苦的藏族农民，全家七个人，土地很少，解放前生活极苦，洛桑每年都要出去做苦工，才能挣得少许收入，贴补家用。1950年的时候，洛桑参加了人民解放军，然后调出去工作。周老一个人领着孩子，在家里种地。当她听说要在本乡搞互助合作，乐滋滋地盼望着，以为这一下可好了。谁知道孔庆德放着近在眼前的马当村不搞，却要辛辛苦苦地到牙当村去搞，她心里想，这倒是一件怪事儿。她的大女儿柴木加，看出母亲几次要提出责问，这位青年团员（她现在是青年团乡支部的副书记）就支持母亲。母亲的勇气大了，有一天就找到孔庆德，问他：“马当村离乡政府近，你们不搞互助合作，是嫌贫爱富吧？”
    这番话把孔庆德从困惑中解救出来。牛多马多人家富的牙当村搞不成，马当村的农民却争取要搞。区委书记曾经告诉他在互助合作运动中应该依靠谁团结谁的原则，他猛一下全记起来了。他回过头来，再研究了马当村的情况，帮助周老建立了这一个藏族地区的第一个藏民互助组。周老被推为互助组长。
    这个互助组是一面旗帜。既然是旗帜，总不免要和风雨进行斗争的；也正因为是旗帜，它和风雨斗争之后，依然屹立着招展着。
    周老的互助组开始是七户，后来锁南吉一户退出了，只剩下六户。锁南吉比较富裕，有一对牛，他当时提出如果要他参加，必须把他的残废姑娘也算个全劳动。这多少有些要挟，组内不能接受，他就退出了。六户的互助组，一直坚持到今年，虽然经过不少的挫折，终于站稳了。现在，他们不但摸索出一套办法，增加了生产，建立了学习制度，扩大了组织——从六户扩大到十九户，而且，社会主义觉悟提高了，这个互助组已经具有农业生产合作社的雏形。
    六户在一起劳动生产，由于人多力量大，产量有显著的提高，例如在一块仅有七担一斗种（每六升种约合一亩）的贫瘠土地上，1954年总产量是九千一百斤，1955年是一万四千七百斤，增产率达到60％以上。生产技术一向比同村汉族农民落后的藏族农民，破天荒地超过了他们。这个“超过”，不是很简单的“超过”，而是大大地闪耀着光芒。藏族农民单干的时候，有人几乎连种籽也收不回，现在却户户丰收；过去年年不够吃，不依靠借贷和救济就得挨饿，去年这六户人家却卖出三百五十斤余粮（青稞）。别看这个数目很小，不够一个人的一年口粮，然而这是从不能自给到富余的伟大开始，是互助组足以夸耀的胜利。别看这个互助组的规模不大，它在这个地区的作为，却显示了冲破旧习、树立新规的巨大力量。例如：过去在秋收之后不翻地、少数人家偶然翻一次，现在组内的土地普遍翻两次。过去牛粪用来烧火，现在规定用作肥料；至于燃料问题，则由妇女们在冬闲时拾柴来解决，去年一个冬天拾回的柴，足够今年烧一年。男子们则在冬闲烧木炭，仅只三个男子的收入，就达到九百五十元。许多从来不种的农作物，例如蔬菜、苜蓿等，现在也种上了。过去的耕作方法粗放，主要是撒种，现在改为拌种条播了。
    同时，由于互助组的倡导和带头，多少年来响往而不能实现的事情，现在也办到了。马当村的地势很高，大夏河清澈的河水，日夜从它前面流过，却不能用它来灌溉。人们要用水，只有从牙首沟里分出来。沟水不多，再加上四个村子引水，水量就更加不够用，有些田地只好眼睁睁地看着干旱，以至于禾苗焦枯，失去收成。这四个村子，为了用水曾经打过架，打死过人，结下冤仇。当互助组成立之后，倡导修渠，并且由组内有威望的藏族老人俄卜景提出面，说服怀疑和反对的人。他们还得到了政府的贷款和技术上的协助。全长六华里，有好几个邃道的水渠，终于修好了。大夏河水源源地输送过来。水流喧哗着，人们欢笑着。这是从来没有的喜事啊！
    今年一月，毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告下达到这个偏僻地区以后，人们的情绪更加高涨，互助合作运动蓬勃开展，这个互助组被藏民们称为“本村的地窖”（意思是说它是基础），吸收了汉族、回族的农户，形成了民族联组。以前退出的锁南吉，也自动请求回来。
    民族联组成立后，订出了较周密的计划，除了农业上进行改革之外，我们只要看看他们在副业上和公共事业上的安排，就可以看出他们的先进精神。他们开辟了果园，种植了163株苹果、梨子等果树，这是马当村甚至这个地区从来未种过的植物。养羊74只。在路边、水边和山坡上，栽了白杨、柳树等4，843株，平均每一个劳动力栽134.5株，其中不少树苗是从一百多里外驮运回来的。
    解放前，这个小村子的三个民族的居民，互不往来。当时流行一句话：“马当住了十八家人，一家不上一家门。”现在，三个民族的居民，在一个组内和睦地劳动着。
    经过差不多三年的坚持，这个组内的成员，深切地体会到互助合作的莫大好处，迫切要求转社。在少数民族地区建社遇到的寺院土地问题，他们解决得也算合理，由农民继续租耕，但减低了租额。查扎寺的活佛马当仓说：“你们才打好围墙，立上柱子，但梁和椽子没有上，还不能蔽风雨；要蔽风雨，就要建社。马当村是我的娘家，你们早点建社，我就高兴！”从活佛的说话，可以想见他们的关系是很不错的。现在，这个组已向区上递了转社申请书。
    马当村的三个民族的互助组，在全国农业合作化的汹涌澎湃的高潮中，只是一股细流。但是，它像流过他们村前的大夏河水一样，无论路怎样远，滩怎样险，总是一直向前，汇合黄河的急湍，奔向大海。社会主义的力量，是无法阻挡的。
