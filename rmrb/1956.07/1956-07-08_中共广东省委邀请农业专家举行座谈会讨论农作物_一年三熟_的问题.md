Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 6th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited agricultural experts to a symposium on the issue of "three crops a year" on the 5th of this month.

More than ten people attended the symposium, including the famous rice expert and Director of the South China Agricultural Science Institute, Ding Ying, and the Vice President of the South China Agricultural College, Li Peiwen.

The symposium focused on a preliminary draft of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's plan regarding the issue of "three crops a year," with expanding the multiple cropping area as its central content. Agricultural experts believe that Guangdong Province has extremely advantageous production conditions, and expanding the multiple cropping area to achieve three crops a year is a long-term and fundamental policy for increasing agricultural production in Guangdong.

According to the Provincial Party Committee's plan for three crops a year, the multiple cropping index of the province's 50 million mu of food crop land will increase from 196% this year to 240%-260% by 1962. With the exception of a small amount of farmland restricted by natural conditions, most farmland will achieve three crops a year.

The experts present believed that, in terms of the types of crops for the three crops, in addition to focusing on two crops of rice, a certain proportion of green manure crops should also be planted while expanding the area of winter grain crops, so as to effectively solve some of the fertilizer problems. In addition, the experts also suggested developing winter flax and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests during the winter planting season.

The experts believe that the implementation of "three crops a year" throughout the province is a great change in agricultural production, which requires a lot of technical research and guidance. They requested that the Party Committee strengthen its leadership of scientific research work in the future.

The person in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stated that they would accept the valuable opinions of the experts and further study and revise the "three crops a year" plan.

    中共广东省委邀请农业专家举行座谈会讨论农作物“一年三熟”的问题
    新华社广州6日电　本月五日，中共广东省委员会邀请农业专家座谈农作物的“一年三熟”问题。
    著名水稻专家、华南农业科学研究所长丁颖和华南农学院副院长李沛文等十多人出席了座谈会。
    座谈会就中共广东省委员会最近制定的以扩大复种面积为中心内容的关于“一年三熟”问题的规划初稿进行座谈。农业专家们认为，广东省具有极优越的生产条件，扩大复种面积，做到一年三熟，是广东农业增产的长期和基本方针。
    按照省委一年三熟的规划，在1962年内全省五千万亩粮食作物的耕地复种率将由今年的196％提高到240％—260％，其中除少数耕地受自然条件限制外，大部分耕地都将实现一年三熟。
    到会的专家们认为，在三熟的作物种类上除抓紧水稻两熟外，在扩大冬种粮食作物面积的同时，还应种植一定面积比例的绿肥作物，以便有效地解决一部分肥料问题。此外，专家们还提出发展冬种亚麻和防治冬种期病虫害等建议。
    专家们认为，在全省实行“一年三熟”是农业生产上的伟大变革，须要进行许多技术研究和指导工作，他们要求党委今后加强对科学研究工作的领导。
    中共广东省委负责人表示接受专家们的宝贵意见，进一步研究和修订“一年三熟”的规划。
