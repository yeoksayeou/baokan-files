Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 7th. The first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Hunan Province was held in Changsha from June 26th to July 6th. 569 delegates elected by more than 282,000 Communist Party members across the province attended the congress.

Zhou Xiaozhou, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC, delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the Provincial Committee.

The report described the great achievements made in agricultural production in Hunan Province after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. The total output value of agricultural production in the province this year is expected to increase by 19.5% compared to 1955.

The report pointed out that the central task of rural work in Hunan Province at present is to continue to work hard to improve grain production, mainly rice, and to continue to develop diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, striving for increased production in 90% of the cooperatives and increased income for 90% of the members, in order to create better conditions for the realization of advanced cooperatives in the autumn.

The report pointed out that in leading agricultural production, the Party overemphasized the collective interests of the cooperatives and did not pay enough attention to the individual interests of the members. It emphasized increased rice production without simultaneously paying attention to strengthening specific leadership over other crops and sideline production. In order to promote double-cropping rice, it even plowed and dug up crops that were about to be harvested in some fields. The reasons for these shortcomings are mainly due to the one-sidedness of the ideological methods, the inability to proceed from reality and comprehensively consider problems. Bureaucratism still exists in the work style. These ideological work styles are major obstacles in our progress. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen the education of cadres in Marxism-Leninism; strengthen learning in practical work; educate Party members and cadres to humbly learn from the masses, and constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism; and strengthen investigation and research.

The delegates unanimously agreed with the report. And based on this report and the opinions of the delegates, a resolution was finally made.

The congress also discussed and adopted the Outline of the Hunan Agricultural Development Plan (Draft) from 1956 to 1967. This outline (draft) is proposed as a suggestion to the people of the province, and will be further revised and supplemented after soliciting opinions from all sectors, especially rural cadres and farmers.

The congress elected a new Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC, consisting of 37 members and 12 alternate members, as well as 31 delegates and 3 alternate delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the CPC.

    湖南举行党代表大会
    据新华社长沙7日电　中国共产党湖南省第一次代表大会六月二十六日到七月六日，在长沙举行。由全省二十八万二千多个共产党员选举出来的569名代表出席了这次大会。
    中共湖南省委员会书记周小舟代表省委向大会作了工作报告。
    报告叙述了湖南省农业合作化高潮以后在农业生产上取得的巨大成绩，今年全省农业生产总产值预计将比1955年增长19.5％。
    报告指出，当前湖南省农村工作的中心任务是要继续努力搞好以稻谷为主的粮食生产，和因地制宜继续开展多种经营，争取90％的社增产、90％的社员增加收入，为秋后实现高级化创造更好的条件。
    报告中指出，党在领导农业生产上，过分强调社的集体利益，对社员个人利益注意不够。强调了稻谷增产，而没有同时注意加强对其他农作物和副业生产的具体领导。为了推广双季稻，甚至把有些地上就要收割的作物犁掉、挖掉。产生这些缺点的原因主要是由于思想方法上还存在片面性，不善于从实际出发，全面考虑问题。作风上还存在官僚主义。这些思想作风是我们前进中的重大障碍。因此，必须对干部认真加强马克思列宁主义的教育；加强在实际工作中的学习；教育党员和干部虚心向群众学习，经常地开展批评与自我批评；加强调查研究。
    代表们对这个报告一致表示同意。并且根据这个报告和代表们的讨论意见最后作出了决议。
    大会还讨论和通过了1956年到1967年湖南农业发展规划纲要（草案）。这个纲要（草案）是作为向全省人民提出的建议，在征求各方面人士的意见，特别是农村干部和农民的意见后将再作进一步修改和补充。
    代表大会选出新的中共湖南省委委员三十七人，候补委员十二人和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表三十一人，候补代表三人。
