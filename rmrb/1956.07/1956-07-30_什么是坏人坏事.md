In our Party and even among the people, the actions of Party members who violate the Party Constitution and Party discipline, or cadres who violate state laws and decrees, are often collectively referred to as "bad people and bad deeds." Some articles published in the People's Daily in the past have also used this term.

Everyone's habit of using the phrase "bad people and bad deeds" shows that everyone is often paying attention to opposing bad people and bad deeds. In this sense, this is a good phenomenon. However, using this term in a general way has major drawbacks. Because, under no circumstances can we treat all those who have made mistakes and the mistakes they have committed, without regard to their nature and without distinction, as "bad people and bad deeds."

The actions of Party members who violate the Party Constitution and Party discipline, or cadres who violate state laws and decrees, generally fall into the following categories: Some people are indeed counter-revolutionaries, class enemies, and other bad elements who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. Their purpose in infiltrating the revolutionary ranks is to sabotage the revolutionary cause and achieve certain evil personal goals. It is absolutely correct to call these people and what they do "bad people and bad deeds." However, those who belong to this category are, after all, only a very small number. Some comrades, for various reasons, seriously violated the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and state laws, causing serious damage to the cause of the Party and the state. This is, of course, a very bad thing. However, as far as these comrades are concerned, they are not the bad people mentioned above but good people. Therefore, we cannot call them bad people simply because these comrades have committed some serious mistakes. There is also another situation, which is that some Party members make minor mistakes in their work or life. Although they may be subject to Party disciplinary action or criticism, it would be too much to call them "bad people and bad deeds." To collectively refer to the latter two types of people and their mistakes as "bad people and bad deeds" will inevitably lead to confusion in concepts, making it impossible to distinguish between good people and bad people, and expanding the scope of "bad people and bad deeds." This is not good for the Party or for comrades who have made mistakes. This will create an atmosphere within our Party that makes many comrades afraid of criticism and afraid of exposing mistakes, because as soon as there is a mistake, they are labeled with the "bad people and bad deeds" hat. This does increase the concerns of comrades and brings resistance to carrying out criticism and self-criticism. For comrades who have made mistakes, the pressure of the term "bad people and bad deeds" is very great. Since they are called "bad people," they will feel that comrades are treating them differently, they will feel isolated, they will be unable to hold their heads up in front of others, and they may even become alienated from the Party and their comrades, losing the confidence to correct their mistakes and strive for progress.

We should be realistic in our approach to everything, and our statements about things must be consistent with their objective content so that they are appropriate. Therefore, whether we are writing instructions, reports, or articles, or in daily conversations, we should no longer collectively refer to those who have made mistakes and their mistakes as "bad people and bad deeds." We must make specific analyses of specific problems. If it is bad people and bad deeds, of course, we must say or write it as bad people and bad deeds. If it is not bad people and bad deeds, we should, in accordance with the actual situation, write or say what kind of person they are, and write or say what kind of mistake it is. We must not sacrifice the meaning for the sake of linguistic simplicity or ease of speaking, and bring losses to the Party and comrades.

    什么是坏人坏事
    吉维
    在我们党内以至人民群众中常常把党员违反党章、党纪或者干部违反国家法律、法令的行为笼统地称之为“坏人坏事”。人民日报过去发表过的一些文章中也有这种说法。
    大家习惯于用坏人坏事的辞句，就表明大家经常注意反对坏人坏事，就这个意义来说，这是好现象。可是，笼统地这样说有很大的毛病。因为，无论如何我们不能把所有犯了错误的人和他们所犯的错误，都不问性质不加区别地当成“坏人坏事”。
    党员违反党章、党纪或者干部违反国家法律、法令的行为，大体有以下几种情况：有些人的确是混进革命阵营的反革命分子、阶级异己分子和其他坏分子，他们混入革命阵营的目的就是破坏革命事业、达到个人的某些罪恶目的，他们的所作所为严重地危害党和国家的事业。把这种人和他们所做的事叫做坏人坏事，一点也不错。可是，属于这种情况的毕竟只是极少数。有些同志由于各种原因严重地违反了党章、党纪和国法，给党和国家的事业造成了严重的损失，这当然是很不好的事情。但是，就这些同志来说，他们并不是上面所谈到的坏人而是好人。因此，我们不能因为这些同志犯了一些严重的错误，也把他们叫做坏人。还有一种情况，就是某些党员在工作中或生活中犯了轻微的错误，虽然，他们也可能要受到党的纪律处分或批评指责，可是，如果把他们也叫做“坏人坏事”，那就太过分了。把后面两种人和他们的错误笼统地叫做“坏人坏事”，势必造成观念上的混乱，分不清好人和坏人，把“坏人坏事”扩大化。这对党和犯错误的同志都是不好的。这就会在我们党内造成一种空气，使好多同志害怕批评、害怕揭发错误，因为一有错误，就被戴上“坏人坏事”的帽子，这的确不能不增加同志们的顾虑，也就给开展批评和自我批评带来了阻力。对于犯错误的同志来说。“坏人坏事”这个名称的压力很大。既然被叫做“坏人”，他们就会感到同志们对他们要另眼看待，他们就会感到自己孤立，在人面前抬不起头来，甚至对党和同志们疏远，失掉了改正错误争取进步的信心。
    我们对待任何事情都应该实事求是，我们对事物的说法一定要和它的客观内容相符合，使它恰如其分。因此，不论是写指示、报告，写文章，还是平日谈话，对于犯错误的人和他们的错误，都不要再笼统地称为“坏人坏事”，要对具体问题做一些具体分析，是坏人坏事，当然要把它说成或写成坏人坏事；不是坏人坏事，就应当按照实际情况，是什么样的人就写成说成什么样的人，是那种错误就写成说成那种错误，不要为了文字上的简便或说起来轻快，就因词害意，给党和同志带来损失。
