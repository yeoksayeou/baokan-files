It is said that there was a type of opera in the Lu Prince's Palace of the Northern Han Dynasty, when the Prince was enfeoffed in Changzhi. After Zhao Kuangyin sent troops to break through Changzhi, it spread to the folk and was called "Gongdiao." Although there are questionable aspects to this legend, the long history of Gongdiao Opera can be proven by this legend. At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, Kong Sanzhuan of Ze Prefecture (Jincheng County) created "Zhu Gongdiao" in Tokyo. This art was brought back to Jincheng by Kong Sanzhuan himself, or his family, or fellow villagers, and passed down. It was still called "Gongdiao" along the way. After it was promoted to the entire Shangdang area, outsiders called it "Shangdang Gongdiao." In recent years, when the Shanxi Central Route Bangzi Opera rose to become "Jin Opera," it was downgraded to "Shangdang Bangzi Opera." There has always been a saying in the nineteen counties of Shangdang: "If you want to see opera, see the state-level opera!" This was said before the early Qing Dynasty, because Ze Prefecture had already been promoted to Ze Prefecture in the eighth year of Yongzheng, and was no longer a state. From this sentence, it can be seen that the history of this kind of opera is at least over two hundred years.

This opera had three characteristics in its performance in the past. One characteristic was that the morning performance sang Kunqiang and Xipi Erhuang, and the afternoon and evening performances sang Bangzi Opera (Gongdiao), Luo Opera, and Zhuan Opera; the second characteristic was that each performance first sang the main play, and then sang two or three accompanying plays (the opposite of today's Peking Opera, which first sings two or three accompanying plays, and then the main play at the end), which is commonly called "one main play and three accompanying plays"; the third characteristic was that each performance had a "head scene," which directly inherited the opening Zhugongdiao of the Southern Opera of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the wedge of the Yuan drama, and the family meaning of the Ming Dynasty legend, and developed it. Let's not talk about the head scene of the morning performance, but only talk about the head scene of the afternoon and evening performances. This scene is usually performed by a middle-aged male character wearing a red gauze hat. After a series of poems, recitations, introductions, and dialogues, the band plays the qiban. With the performance of the music, the actors sing from slow to fast, gradually calming down the noisy voices of the crowd at the temple fair below the stage, as if they were a thousand troops and horses. After everyone calmed down, they led everyone into a state of tension and excitement. Immediately afterwards, according to the opening tune of the main play, using different tunes such as yang (yangqiang), liu (liuban), guo (guoban), and song (songban), the last sentence of the lyrics directly leads to the opening of the main play. The role of this head scene lies in calming the emotions of all the opera-goers from noisy to calm on the one hand, and concentrating the emotions of all the opera-goers from scattered to concentrated on the other hand, so that every actor in the play sings particularly harmoniously and beautifully. This centuries-old artistic opening method, although it originated from the characteristics of grass-roots opera, is it without any reserved value? It is still worth studying, but unfortunately, it has not been seen at all since liberation.

I think there is also a reason for singing the main play first and then the accompanying plays. When people watch opera, they are generally full of energy at the beginning, and the more they watch, the more tired they become. Especially in the past, singing operas was often long and drawn-out. After people have finished watching the main good opera, it is okay if they are not tired. They can continue to watch the accompanying plays. Those who are tired or have something to do can go home to sleep or do other things. This also has its advantages. This method may not be necessary to move to regular theater performances now, but in occasions other than regular theater performances, such as touring performances in rural areas or construction sites, I don't think this method is impossible to try.

I think it would be best if the Changzhi Special District Delegation to Beijing for a reporting performance in Shanxi Province had an opportunity to try a performance according to the old rules of the year, and invite people from the opera circle and other related comrades to see whether these characteristics of their performances have the value of restoration and promotion. I also suggest that this performance method be filmed and recorded, so as to avoid the situation where even filming is not possible after some time.

    上党戏演出上的一些特点
    秦春风
    相传当年封在长治的北汉国潞王宫里有一种戏，在赵匡胤派兵打破长治以后，流传到民间来，就叫做“宫调”。这传说虽有可疑的地方，不过宫调戏的历史悠久，却是可以从这传说里得到证明。北宋末年，泽州（晋城县）孔三传在东京创“诸宫调”，这种艺术由孔三传本人、或他的家属、或同乡带回晋城来，流传下来，一路仍叫做“宫调”，后来推行到全上党区以后，外地人就叫他做“上党宫调”。近年来山西中路梆子升成了“晋剧”，才把它降称成“上党梆子”。上党十九县历来有一句口碑：“要看还是州底戏！”这是清初以前的话，因为雍正八年泽州已经升成泽州府，而不是州了。从这一句话也可以看出这种戏的历史至少是二百年开外了。
    这种戏在演出上，过去有三个特点。一个特点是，上午的一场唱昆腔和西皮二黄，下午和夜里的两场唱梆戏（宫调）、罗戏、赚戏；第二个特点是，每场先唱正本，后唱两三个搭出（和如今的京戏正相反，京戏是先唱两三个搭出，末尾才是正本戏），俗话叫做“一本三出”；第三个特点是，每场都有一个“头场”，这是直接继承了宋元南戏开场的诸宫调、元剧的楔子、明代传奇的家门大意，并加以发展的。上午场的头场且不说，只说下午和夜场的头场，这种场面，通常是由一个红?纱帽的须生出来，诗、白、引、对一阵，接着乐队奏起起板，随着乐曲的演奏，演员由慢到快，一路唱下来，把庙会台下如同千军万马一般的嘈杂人声，一步步安定下来；等大家安定下来以后，又把大家引到紧张兴奋的情绪里来，紧接着根据正本开场的乐调，用扬（扬腔）溜（溜板）过（过板）送（送板）等不同的调门，由末一句唱辞，直接引起正本的开场。这头场的作用，就在于一方面把全体看戏人的情绪，从嘈杂引到镇静，一方面把全体唱戏人的情绪，从散漫引到集中，使本场戏的每一个演员都唱得特别合调好听。这个几百年来的艺术开场法，虽然是从草台戏的特点中产生的，但是不是毫无保留价值，也还值得研究，可惜解放以来，却完全看不到了。
    先唱正本，后唱搭出，我想也有它的道理。人们看戏的时候，一般总是开始的时候精力充沛，越看精神也越疲劳。特别是过去唱戏，常常是长本大套，拖沓得很。先演正本，人们看完了正本好戏以后，不疲劳也没有事的，就接看搭出，疲劳的或有事的，就可以各自回家睡觉，或干别的事去，也有它的好处。这种办法现在也许是没有搬到正规的剧场演出里来的必要了，但在正规的剧场演出以外的场合，如到农村或工地的巡回演出，这种办法，我想也不是不可以试行的。
    山西省长治专区赴京汇报演出团到北京公演，我想最好有一个机会让他们按照当年的老规矩试演一番，请戏曲界和其他有关的同志们看一看他们在演出上的这些特点有没有恢复和发扬的价值。我也建议把这种演出方法拍成电影，记录下来，免得再过些时候，连拍电影也没有条件了。
