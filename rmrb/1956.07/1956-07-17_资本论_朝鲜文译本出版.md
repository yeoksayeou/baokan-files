    "Das Kapital" Korean Translation Published
    Earlier this year, the Korean Workers' Party Publishing House published the Korean translation of "Das Kapital".
    Political economists of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have long devoted their full energy to the translation and publication of "Das Kapital." In early 1950, part of the first volume of "Das Kapital" was translated and published, but this work was interrupted due to the outbreak of the Fatherland Liberation War. The currently published "Das Kapital" is the first section of the first volume, which includes the first part, "Commodities and Money," analyzing the production process of capital, the second part, "The Transformation of Money into Capital," the third part, "The Production of Absolute Surplus Value," and the fourth part, "The Production of Relative Surplus Value." This Korean translation of "Das Kapital" is based on the German fourth edition (edited by Engels) and the 1953 Russian edition, and was translated by the late political economist Bu Kezai. In the future, the three volumes of the Korean translation of "Das Kapital" will continue to be published in five sections.
