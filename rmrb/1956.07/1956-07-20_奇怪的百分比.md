    Strange Percentages
    Wang Lin
    In some factories and mines in Tangshan City, whenever the advanced producer movement is mentioned, they always talk about the number 70% first. From their tone, a sense of helplessness is revealed. It turns out that this "70%" ratio is the target set by the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China for each factory and mine, stipulating that the number of advanced producers must reach a percentage of the total number of employees by the end of the fourth quarter, which has risen from 30% in the second quarter and 50% in the third quarter.
    Of course, it would be best if 100% of the workers in all our enterprises became advanced producers, and 70% is also an exciting number. But is it possible to achieve this goal? The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China did not consider this.
    In order to complete this task stipulated by the Municipal Committee, each factory and mine included all those who fully completed their production tasks in the list of advanced producers, but still failed to reach 70%. So they turned to workers who did not have production targets (mostly auxiliary workers) for help, and as long as they did not have an accident within a month, they were listed as advanced producers. If a certain production team completed the production task on average, then the entire team was promoted. As a result, even those who consistently failed to complete production tasks became "advanced producers."
    Frankly speaking, the masses are not happy with this approach, and those who become advanced producers are also very uncomfortable. A production team at the Yongli Magnetic Factory was given the title of "Advanced Producer Team" simply because it completed the production task on average. After the awards were given to all the members, two workers in the team who had consistently failed to complete production tasks pointed to the vests printed with the words "Advanced Producer" and said: "This is a joke, just asking for a scolding!" Chen Baiqi, a worker in the third excavation area of the Tangshan Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine, often dozed and slept during working hours. After being nominated as an advanced producer by the leadership, many workers said: "Such an advanced producer is better off not being one." Although there were many opinions from the masses, some factories still completed the target of expanding the ranks of advanced producers.
    After completing the task of "expanding the ranks of advanced producers," many factory and mine leaders immediately encountered a problem: what to do if there are too many advanced producers and too little bonus money? Finally, they all came up with solutions: some reduced the scope of rewards, rewarding those with outstanding achievements; others gave everyone a reward, no matter how much. As a result, only four of the thirty-plus advanced producers at the Linxi Coal Washing Plant received material rewards. The total value of the prizes received by the 1,932 advanced producers at the Kailuan Tangshan Mine was only 3,000 yuan. Some advanced producers said: "I am an advanced producer who was stuck together with spit" (meaning they only heard a few words of praise); others said: "Actually, I don't really need these few popsicles."
    After the test of practice, is the "70%" target in line with the actual situation, or is it formalism? Now, it is time to draw a conclusion.

    奇怪的百分比
    王林
    在唐山市的一些厂矿里，只要谈起先进生产者运动，他们总是首先说70％这个数字。从他们的语气中，透露着无可奈何的情绪。原来这个“70％”的比例，是中共唐山市委给各厂矿规定的到四季度末先进生产者人数必须达到占全体职工总数的指标，这是由第二季度的30％、第三季度的50％升上来的。
    当然，我们所有企业的工人100％都成为先进生产者是最好了，70％也是个令人兴奋的数字。但是能不能达到这个指标呢？中共唐山市委是没有考虑的。
    各厂矿为完成市委规定的这项任务，把全面完成生产任务的人都列入先进生产者的名单，还是达不到70％。于是就向生产上没有指标的工人（多是辅助工）求救，只要他们在一个月内没出事故，就列为先进生产者。如果某一生产小组平均完成了生产任务，那么就全组荣升。这样一来，有一贯完不成生产任务的人也当了“先进生产者”。
    老实说这种做法，群众是不乐意的，当上先进生产者的人也很不舒服。永利磁厂的一个生产小组，只因平均完成了生产任务，即被冠以“先进生产者小组”的头衔。给全体人员发奖以后，组内两名一向完不成生产任务的工人指着印有“先进生产者”字样的背心说：“这是开玩笑，硬给我们找骂挨！”开滦煤矿唐山矿第三掘进区的工人陈百岐，常常在工作时间打盹、睡觉，在被领导提名为先进生产者后，很多工人就说：“这样的先进生产者，当，不如不当。”群众的意见虽然很多，但是有些厂还是完成了扩大先进生产者队伍的指标。
    在完成了“扩大先进生产者队伍”任务以后，不少厂矿的领导者马上遇到了一个问题：先进生产者人数众多，奖励基金少怎么办呢？终于都想出了办法：有的是缩小奖励面，奖励成绩突出的；有的是人人有奖，不论多少。结果林西洗煤厂三十多个先进生产者，只有四名得到了物质奖。开滦唐山矿1，932名先进生产者，所得奖品的总值只有三千元。有的先进生产者说：“我这个先进生产者，是用唾沫粘来的”（意思是光听了几句表扬的话）；有的说：“其实我也并不缺这几根冰棍吃”。
    经过实践的考验，“70％”这个指标是否合乎实际情况，还是形式主义的呢？现在，是到了应该作结论的时候了。
