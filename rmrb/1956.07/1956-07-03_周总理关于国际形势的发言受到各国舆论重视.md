    Indian newspapers say the Chinese Premier's statement is welcomed by Asian and African people.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 30th: The Hindi daily "Nava Bharat Times" said in its editorial today that "the Chinese Premier's statement will be welcomed by Asian and African people," and "Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to hold negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek government to resolve the Taiwan issue has brought a new transformation to East Asian politics."
    The newspaper also welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's guarantee to the Kuomintang military and government personnel that they would be able to visit their relatives on the mainland. The newspaper added: "This is a good opportunity for the Chiang Kai-shek government to negotiate. They should abandon their dream of reoccupying all of China and accept this proposal. If the Chiang Kai-shek government still insists on its obstructionist policy, it will lose even the slightest bit of sympathy it currently has in the world."
    The newspaper also said: "Therefore, despite Chiang Kai-shek, it will be difficult for the United States to maintain control over Taiwan."
    The Urdu newspaper "The Glory" believes that China's announcement will help it win recognition from more countries. The newspaper said, "It seems that all countries in the world except the United States will recognize the People's Republic of China." The newspaper added that the United States will have to change its attitude towards China.
    Japanese circles attach importance to it, newspapers are dissatisfied with the government's passive attitude.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 2nd: Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on June 28th has received attention from all sectors in Japan. When publishing this speech, major Japanese newspapers generally indicated in the headlines that the Chinese side hopes to normalize its relations with Japan.
    Masao Tanaka, director of the Information and Culture Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference on June 29th that Japan "will not change its previous policy" on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China. He said that we believe that we will adjust our diplomatic relations with China after restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and other communist countries. He revealed that due to the complex international situation, Japan cannot take immediate steps to normalize relations with China.
    Tanaka also said that at present, they will not discuss political issues with China, but only handle trade issues in the same way as in the past without violating "international obligations."
    Japanese Radio broadcast on June 28th that the Hatoyama Cabinet had adopted a passive attitude towards restoring diplomatic relations with China. Premier Zhou Enlai's speech seemed to express dissatisfaction with the Hatoyama Cabinet's indecisive attitude.
    Major Japanese newspapers also published comments. The "Asahi Shimbun" editorial said: "It is undeniable that the Japanese government has no enthusiasm to negotiate with New China. It should be noted that this attitude has deviated from the will of the Japanese people." This influential newspaper is dissatisfied with the Japanese government's passive attitude. It said that even the United States has held 51 ambassador-level talks with China, but the consul-general-level talks between Japan and China have only been held a few times, and not even once this year.
    British and French newspapers believe that our country's attitude towards the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is more clear.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: British and French newspapers and news agencies have commented on Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress. A Reuters reporter said that the speech "is part of China's increasing policy of trying to ease tensions abroad and at home."
    The part of the speech concerning the peaceful liberation of Taiwan has received the most attention. Many reports say that although the issue of peaceful liberation of Taiwan has been raised in the past, the attitude expressed this time is more clear. An Agence France-Presse reporter said that this time "the proposal was put forward so clearly that there is no room for doubt or misunderstanding."
    The "Manchester Guardian," after pointing out that Premier Zhou's speech "has great significance," said that it is clear that Beijing believes that "the time has come to end China's long-term civil war through an agreement with the Kuomintang."
    Some American officials insist it is "the same old thing," but privately express concern.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 2nd: Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress on June 28th has received widespread attention from American officials and newspapers. The speech is considered another "peace offensive" following the Soviet Union's peace measures.
    The U.S. State Department refused to express a public opinion on Zhou Enlai's speech. Some officials insisted that the speech was "the same old thing" and "nothing new." However, opinions expressed privately by officials show that they paid close attention to the part of the speech concerning the Chinese government's willingness to negotiate with the Taiwan authorities on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Some people expressed concern about the impact of this speech on the Chiang Kai-shek group and the support it might receive from neutral countries.
    Some Washington evening newspapers prominently published the part of the speech regarding Taiwan on the day of Zhou Enlai's speech. The "Star" published a United Press International dispatch on the front page, with the headline: "Zhou suggests direct talks with Taiwan on the issue of handover."
    In recent days, some important American newspapers have also published comments on this part of the speech one after another. Some newspapers continue to express concern about the impact of the speech. The "Christian Science Monitor" said that Zhou Enlai's speech is likely to be a superficially calm "time bomb" scheduled to explode in a few months.

    周总理关于国际形势的发言受到各国舆论重视
    印度报纸说，中国总理的声明受到亚非人士的欢迎
    据新华社新德里30日电　印地文日报“新印度时报”今天的社论说，“中国总理的声明将受到亚非人士的欢迎”，“周恩来总理建议同蒋介石政府举行谈判以解决台湾问题，从而使东亚政治有了新的转变”。
    这家报纸还在社论中欢迎周恩来总理对国民党军政人员作出的这个保证：他们能够探访他们在大陆上的家属。这家报纸又说：“这是蒋介石政府进行谈判的好机会。他们应该放弃重新占领全中国的梦想，而接受这个建议。如果蒋介石政府到现在还坚持它的阻挠政策，那么它连世界上现在对它仅有的任何一点点同情也会丧失掉”。
    这家报纸还说：“因此，尽管有蒋介石，美国将很难保持对台湾的控制。”
    乌尔都文报纸“荣耀报”认为，中国的这个宣告将有助于赢得更多的国家承认它。报纸说，“看来除了美国以外，世界上所有国家都将要承认中华人民共和国。”报纸又说，美国将必须改变它对中国的态度。
    日本各界都表示重视，报纸不满政府的消极态度
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：中国总理周恩来在六月二十八日的发言受到日本各界的重视。日本各大报在普遍刊登这个发言的时候，都在标题上指明中国方面希望使它同日本的关系正常化。
    日本外务省情报文化局局长田中三男六月二十九日在记者招待会上说，日本对于同中国恢复邦交问题“将不改变以往的方针”。他说，我们认为同苏联和其他共产党国家恢复邦交以后才会调整同中国之间的邦交。他透露，由于复杂的国际局势，在同中国的关系正常化问题上，日本不能够立即采取步骤。
    田中还说，目前不会同中国谈政治问题，只是在贸易问题上要在不违反“国际义务”的情况下按以往方式办理。
    日本电台在六月二十八日当天广播说，鸠山内阁对恢复同中国的邦交采取了消极的态度。周恩来总理的发言似乎对鸠山内阁的举棋不定的态度表示不满。
    日本各大报也发表了评论。“朝日新闻”的社论说：“无可否认，日本政府没有热情同新中国进行协商，须知这种态度已经离开了日本人民的意志”。这家有影响的报纸不满意日本政府的消极态度，它说，连美国也已经同中国举行了五十一次的大使级会谈，但是日本和中国的总领事级会谈却不过举行了数次，而且今年来一次都还没有举行。
    英法报纸认为我国对和平解放台湾问题的态度更加明确
    新华社2日讯　英国和法国的报纸和通讯社都对周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言发表了评论。路透社记者说，这个发言“是中国设法缓和国外和国内紧张局势的日益加强的政策的一部分”。
    发言中关于和平解放台湾部分最受注意。许多消息说，和平解放台湾问题虽然过去已被提出过，但是，这次所表示的态度更加明确。法新社记者说，这一次“这个建议提得这样明确，毫无怀疑或误解的余地。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”在指出周总理的发言“具有很大的意义”后说，显然，北京认为通过同国民党“协议来结束中国长期的内战的时机已经在来临。”
    美国一些官员硬说是“老一套”，但私下里又表示忧虑
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：中国周恩来总理六月二十八日在全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言受到美国官方和报纸的普遍注意。这篇发言被认为是继苏联和平措施之后的又一“和平攻势”。
    美国国务院拒绝对周恩来的发言表示公开的意见。一些官员硬说这个发言是“老一套”，“没有新鲜东西”。但是从官员们私下表示的意见可以看出，他们十分注意发言中关于中国政府愿意同台湾当局协商和平解放台湾的问题。有些人对这个发言将会在蒋介石集团内部产生的影响以及它可能受到中立国家的支持表示忧虑。
    华盛顿的一些晚报都在周恩来发言的当天在显著地位刊载了关于台湾部分的发言。“明星报”在头版新闻中刊载美联社发出的消息，标题是：“周向台湾建议就移交问题举行直接谈判”。
    最近几天，美国一些重要报纸还在接二连三地就这部分发言发表评论。一些报纸对发言将会引起的影响继续表示不安。“基督教科学箴言报”说，周恩来的讲话很可能是一颗预定在几个月以后爆炸的表面平静的“定时炸弹”。
