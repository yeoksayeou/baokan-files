　　Merchants in Malaya and Singapore are striving to expand trade with "Communist countries." Reuters quoted some aphorisms from the "Singapore Tiger Standard" editorial with considerable emotion: "In the contradiction between political ideology and economic interests, traders carry out their trade and have to forget politics."
　　Economic relations are primary, ideological relations are secondary, the former determines the latter, there is no need to believe in dialectical materialism to follow it.
　　American Hollywood musicians who shouted the slogan "Music First" were persecuted by the American authorities. The Un-American Activities Committee, which specializes in presenting the American people with the crime of "subverting the government," subpoenaed 35 musicians ("Literary Gazette" No. 13). This is nothing to be surprised about. In the clamor of "Guns First," if "music" also wants to compete for a place, and even tries to climb to the top of the "guns," how can it not be resented!

    马来亚和新加坡的商人正在努力扩大对“共产党国家”的贸易。路透社不无感慨地引用了“新加坡虎报”社论中的一些警句：“在政治思想和经济利益之间的矛盾中，贸易商们进行他们的贸易，不得不忘记政治。”
    经济关系第一性，思想关系第二性，前者决定后者，固无须乎相信了辩证唯物主义，才会跟着它跑。
    高呼“音乐第一”口号的美国好莱坞音乐工作者受到美国当局的迫害，专门给美国人民奉送“颠复政府”罪名的非美活动委员会传讯了三十五名音乐工作者（“文艺报”第十三期）。这是没有什么可怪的。在“大炮第一”的叫嚣声中，“音乐”也想去争一席地，甚至企图爬到“大炮”头上去，哪还有不遭忌的！
