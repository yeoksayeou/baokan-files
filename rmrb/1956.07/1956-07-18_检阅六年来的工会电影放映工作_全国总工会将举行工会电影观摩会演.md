    Reviewing Six Years of Trade Union Film Projection Work
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions to Hold Trade Union Film Festival

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in order to review the achievements of six years of trade union film projection work, has decided to hold the "National Trade Union Film Festival" in Beijing starting from July 31st of this year. Through the film festival, a number of outstanding film projection units and projection personnel will be selected and rewarded, in order to encourage and develop the enthusiasm and creativity of all film projectionists in the trade union system, and further promote the film projection work of trade unions.

    Thirty-three trade union film projection teams will attend the film festival. They are small teams and projection personnel with achievements in their work, selected by the trade unions of various provinces, municipalities directly under the central government, and autonomous regions, as well as the trade unions of the railways and the Second Ministry of Machinery. At present, trade union organizations across the country are conducting selection work. Some provinces, such as Gansu, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have already selected representative teams in May.

    During the film festival, the representative teams will perform on-site demonstrations of projection technical operations and film publicity work. The conference will evaluate them based on their proficiency in on-site technical operations, the sound and light quality during projection, and the publicity work for the films, combined with their daily work performance and the execution and completion of projection tasks, and will give material rewards accordingly. At the same time, small teams or individuals who have made significant achievements in their work will be given additional rewards. In order to do a good job in the award evaluation at the film festival, the conference preparatory committee has hired responsible comrades, management cadres, and technical personnel from the cultural, military, and trade union departments' film management agencies to form a selection committee.

    In addition, concurrently with the film festival, a "National Trade Union Film Projection Team Work Achievement Exhibition" will be held, exhibiting various physical objects made and created by projection personnel in their work, such as machine repair tools, substitutes for projection equipment, slide projectors, movie posters and propaganda paintings, as well as various charts showing the execution and completion of projection tasks.

    检阅六年来的工会电影放映工作
    全国总工会将举行工会电影观摩会演
    本报讯　中华全国总工会为了检阅六年来工会电影放映工作的成绩，决定自今年七月三十一日起在北京举行“全国工会电影观摩会演”。通过会演，将评选和奖励一批优秀的电影放映单位和放映人员，以鼓舞和发挥工会系统全体电影放映员的积极性和创造性，进一步推动工会的电影放映工作。
    出席会演的将有三十三个工会电影放映队。他们是由各省、直辖市和自治区的工会以及铁路和第二机械的工会选拔出来的在工作上有成绩的小队和放映人员。目前，全国各地的工会组织都正在进行选拔工作，有的省如甘肃、广东、江西、湖南和内蒙自治区的工会已经在五月份内选拔出了代表队。
    会演期间，各代表队将进行放映技术操作和电影宣传工作的现场表演。大会将根据他们现场表演的技术操作熟练程度，放映时的声光质量和影片的宣传工作，并结合他们日常工作成绩和放映任务的执行和完成情况，进行评比，分别给予物质奖励。同时，对在工作中有显著成绩的小队或个人，另外给予奖励。为了做好会演时的评奖工作，大会筹备委员会已经聘请了文化、军委和工会部门电影管理机构的负责同志、管理干部和技术人员等组成了评选委员会。
    此外，在会演的同时，还将举办“全国工会电影放映队工作成绩展览会”，展出各地放映人员在工作中制作和创造出来的各种实物，如修理机器的工具、放映机器材的代用品、幻灯机、电影海报和宣传画，以及执行和完成放映任务的各种图表等。　（马化民）
