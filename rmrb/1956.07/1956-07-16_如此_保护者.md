Such "Protectors"
    Recently, West German Foreign Minister Brentano, in order to explain West Germany's continued support for the Western occupation forces, made many good remarks about the occupation forces in a statement. He said that the occupation forces are stationed in West Germany to "protect Germany," and that "the government is convinced that this protection is needed," because it is said that "West Germany cannot do without the protection they provide."
    However, when this Foreign Minister made such flattering remarks, he was aware of the records of these "protectors," because his desk was still filled with letters of complaint from many places about the atrocities of the American troops.
    Bavarian Prime Minister Hoegner publicly requested the commander of the U.S. occupation forces' Seventh Army to take measures against the incidents of American troops attacking German citizens. He said that the number of American atrocities that occurred in the first half of this year has exceeded the total number that occurred in the entire year of last year.
    Baden-Württemberg Prime Minister Müller complained to the Foreign Minister that in cities such as Mannheim, Heilbronn, Ulm, and Göppingen, incidents of Americans insulting pedestrians, beating and robbing car drivers, and abusing women are constantly occurring.
    The Baden-Württemberg state parliament and government even had to hold a special meeting to discuss in detail the atrocities committed by occupying soldiers against German women.
    The West German people do not have the kind of feelings towards these "protectors" that Brentano expressed. In order to demand that the occupation forces return the houses and land they have occupied, they often engage in what West German newspapers call "house wars" with the occupation forces. Residents of Dreiborn, a village in the Eifel region, flew black flags for a week to protest the occupation forces.
    Under the pressure of the West German people, General Hodes, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in Europe, could not help but admit that the criminal behavior of the occupation forces in West Germany is constantly increasing. However, these "lords" do not have to talk about what measures they are prepared to take to stop these atrocities. If you think about how afraid the West German Foreign Minister is of offending the "protectors," it is no wonder that the American "lords" are so outrageous.
    However, the occupation forces have indeed played a "protective" role for the West German Nazis and those monopoly capitalists who are colluding with the United States. For example, since the end of the war, the occupation authorities of Western countries have protected countless Nazi war criminals and major arms monopoly capitalists from prison, enabling them to be released and restored to their original positions. Now, Adenauer is begging the United States to support him through the crisis-ridden election. In this sense, Brentano's view that West Germany cannot survive without the "protection" of the occupation forces is also reasonable. But the people of West Germany hate and detest these "protectors" standing on their heads.

### 如此“保护者”

    如此“保护者”
    最近，西德外长勃伦塔诺为了解释西德要继续供养西方占领军，在一篇声明里替占领军说了不少好话。他说：占领军驻在西德是为了“保护德国”，而且“政府确信，它是需要这种保护的”，因为据说“西德没有它们提供的保护是不行的”。
    但是，当这位外长这样吹拍的时候，他是知道这些“保护者”的纪录的，因为他的案头就还放着来自许多地方的不满美军暴行的控诉信。
    巴伐利亚州总理豪格纳公开要求美占领军第七军军长对美军袭击德国公民的事件采取措施。他说，今年上半年中所发生的美军暴行事件，已经超过了去年全年中所发生的。
    巴登—瓦登堡州总理米勒给外长的控诉说：在曼海姆、海尔布隆、乌尔姆、格品根等城镇，不断发生美国侮辱行人、殴打和抢劫汽车司机和虐待妇女的事件。
    巴登—瓦登堡州的地方议会和政府甚至不得不召开一次专门的会议来详细讨论占领军士兵对德国妇女的暴行问题。
    西德人民对这些“保护者”并没有像勃伦塔诺所表示的那种感情。他们为了要求占领军归还占用的房屋和土地，经常和占领军发生如西德报纸所称的“房屋战争”。爱非尔的一个村庄德莱本的居民，曾挂了一星期的黑旗，对占领军表示抗议。
    在西德人民的压力下，美国驻欧洲陆军总司令霍迪斯也不能不出来承认：在西德的占领军的犯罪行为不断增加。但，这些“太上皇”是不必谈到他准备采取什么措施来阻止这些暴行的。如果想一想西德外长怎样害怕触犯“保护者”，那就难怪美国的“太上皇”那样放肆了。
    但是，占领军对西德纳粹分子和那些和美国勾结在一起的垄断资本家，倒确是起了“保护”作用的。例如，战后以来，西方国家的占领当局已经从监狱里保护了数不清的纳粹战犯和大军火垄断资本家，使他们获得释放，并恢复了他们原有的地位。现在，阿登纳正在乞求美国支持他渡过危机重重的大选。在这个意义上，勃伦塔诺认为西德没有占领军的“保护”就过不了日子，也是有道理的。但是西德的人民却讨厌和憎恶这种站在他们头上的“保护者”。　（林）
