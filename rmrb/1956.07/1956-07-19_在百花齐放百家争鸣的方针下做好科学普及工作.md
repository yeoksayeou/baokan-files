    Do a Good Job of Popularizing Science Under the Policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend
    Liang Xi
    Recently, the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend." "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" refers to literary and artistic work, especially theatrical work; "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" refers to scientific work and general academic work.
    In the work of popularizing science, I think both of these sentences can be taken as golden rules. Because, on the one hand, the work of the Science Popularization Association itself is science, and must have scientific seriousness within a certain scope; but on the other hand, our work must be popular, it must be explained in a way that people can easily understand, it must be attractive and make everyone interested in science after listening or reading. Therefore, the writing should be relaxed and flexible, with beautiful and vivid pictures. Sometimes it is okay to "personify" plants, animals, and minerals: soil can be called mother; trees can be organized into armies, or can enter schools; birds, beasts, insects, and fish can speak; if necessary, "gods" can also come out of the sky. It can be said that the work of popularizing science has some artistic elements.
    In the work of popularizing science, since there is science and also art, we must implement the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend."
    As everyone knows, the drama circle has achieved great success after implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new." President Guo Moruo of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also said in his speech at the National People's Congress meeting that our flowers are blooming all over China, all over Asia, all over Europe, and also blooming in Africa, and are appreciated everywhere. What President Guo Moruo said was "the flowers of literature and art." Why can the flowers of literature and art be appreciated everywhere? Because they are full of sound and color.
    I think our "flowers of science" must also be full of sound and color. In fact, we do have the conditions to make the work of popularizing science full of sound and color. Because:
    First, the Party attaches importance to the work of popularizing science. When the Party Central Committee held the intellectuals' conference, it also made a science popularization report; in the science work symposium held by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in April this year, it also organized reports on ten new scientific achievements, and at the same time made unified arrangements for the science popularization work of relevant departments.
    Second, the vast majority of scientists across the country are enthusiastic about engaging in science popularization work. This can be seen by looking at the National Science and Technology Popularization Association and the science and technology popularization associations in various places, and how they organize science and technology workers in various places to actively participate in science popularization publicity activities.
    Third, the Chinese people need science popularization work. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have successively issued joint notices with the National Science Popularization Association, requiring all localities to treat science popularization as a regular task. These units represent millions and tens of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, young people, and cadres, and they tell us that the Chinese people need science and need scientists to do more popularization work.
    Fourth, international friends need us to do more science popularization work. The science popularization associations of the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries have exchanged publications with us. At the beginning of April this year, Academician Obalin, Chairman of the All-Union Society for Political and Scientific Knowledge Dissemination, came to our country to attend the tenth anniversary of the World Federation of Scientific Workers and requested us to compile two booklets on the first five-year plan and on agricultural cooperativization, and asked us to introduce the affairs of New China to the Soviet people through the All-Union Society for Political and Scientific Knowledge Dissemination in the future.
    Under such circumstances, can Chinese scientists still let one flower bloom alone? No. We must "let a hundred flowers bloom."
    "Hundred flowers" means there are many kinds of flowers, many flowers, not monotonous.
    "Bloom together" means that the flowers bloom at the same time. They bloom all over the mountains, all over the garden, all over the trees, not scattered.
    The work of popularizing science is the same.
    There should be many categories of publicity: physics, mathematics, technical sciences, medicine and health, geology, geography, chemistry, chemical industry, biology, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, meteorology, etc., all kinds, everything should be available.
    There should be many publicity positions: lectures, broadcasts, journals, supplements, booklets, movies, slides, exhibitions, all kinds, everything should be available.
    There should be many publicity times: for example, in 1955, there were 12,294 lectures nationwide, and this year, according to estimates, nearly 400,000 lectures are needed just for workers, plus the Communist Youth League, the army, the cultural system, and the countryside, which requires 500,000 lectures.
    And like blooming flowers, it is not only necessary to bloom a lot, but also to bloom well, so that workers, peasants, soldiers, young people, and cadres are all satisfied after listening or watching, and everyone gets a lot of benefits.
    This is the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" of science popularization work.
    How can this ideal be realized? This has to require the Science and Technology Popularization Association to implement the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend." How can we achieve "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend"? This has to require various specialized academic groups in the Science and Technology Popularization Association, such as the Physics Group, the Civil Engineering Group, and the Meteorology Group, to take on more responsibilities.
    According to the Soviet experience, in order to do a good job in science popularization, we must give play to the potential of scientists and improve the quality of work through specialized organizations. This organization is the "academic group."
    The tasks of the academic group are to formulate publicity plans and publicity topics, organize manuscripts, recommend publicity personnel, discuss the content of manuscripts, study mass reactions, put forward improvement opinions, and so on. That is to say, we must "Let a hundred schools contend," we must "Let a hundred schools argue."
    "Contend" means open discussion, free expression of opinions, and putting forward criticisms as much as possible.
    "Argue" means debate, argument. We are serving the people, in order to meet the needs of the people, in order to make the people get more benefits, it is best that every manuscript, even that of a famous writer, must be reviewed and revised by the academic group, and every lecture, even that given by a senior, must be studied by the academic group for the opinions of the audience, pointed out shortcomings, and put forward suggestions for improvement. Of course, doing so is troublesome, but the work is done more perfectly because of the discussions of all parties. It must be pointed out that science popularization articles are different from scientific research reports. They are written for non-professionals. They must be simple and easy to understand, and written in popular language. To ensure that the article is popular, we cannot rely on the author's own views alone, we must rely on the evaluation of the majority of people in the academic group to be more reliable. Here, I tell a story: Bai Juyi, a great poet of the Tang Dynasty, often read his poems to the maids in his house. If the maids in his house did not understand, he would think that his writing was not popular and would immediately change it, until the maids understood. In this respect, this is a good example for science popularization workers.
    "Contend" is also competition, that is, socialist labor competition. Academic groups compare with academic groups, and individuals compare with individuals, to see who "contends" more and who "contends" better.
    This is the "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" of science popularization work.
    By doing this, the work of popularizing science will be improved step by step, the knowledge of the working people will increase little by little, and the Science Popularization Association will also develop day by day.
    All in all, in the academic group, the most important issues, I think, are only two. The first question is: What do we use to serve the people, that is, what is the content of science popularization work? The answer is, "Let a hundred flowers bloom"; the second question is: How to do a good job in science popularization? The answer is "Let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    在百花齐放百家争鸣的方针下做好科学普及工作
    梁希
    最近，党中央提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。“百花齐放”，说的是文艺工作，特别是戏剧工作；“百家争鸣”，说的是科学工作和一般学术工作。
    在科学普及工作上，我以为这两句话都可以拿来作为金科玉律。因为，一方面科学普及协会的工作本身是科学，在一定范围内要有科学的严肃性；但是另一方面，我们的工作要普及，要说得人们容易懂，要引人入胜，叫大家听了或看了对科学发生兴趣。所以文字要写得轻松、灵活，配上美丽生动的图画。有时不妨把植物、动物、矿物“人格化”起来：土壤可以称妈妈；树木可以编军队，也可以进学校；鸟、兽、虫、鱼可以说话；如有必要，天上还可以走出“神仙”来。可以说，科学普及工作，是带一些文艺性的。
    在科学普及工作中，既然有科学，又有文艺，那就必须贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。
    大家知道，戏剧界贯彻了毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策以后，获得了很大的成绩。中国科学院郭沫若院长在这次全国人民代表大会会议上的发言中也说，我们的花，开遍全中国，开遍全亚洲，开遍全欧洲，又开到了非洲，到处被人欣赏。郭沫若院长说的是“文艺之花”。文艺之花为什么能够到处被人欣赏？因为它有声有色。
    我以为，我们的“科学之花”，也必须做到有声有色才好。而事实上我们也的确有条件可以把科学普及工作做得有声有色。因为：
    首先，党重视科学普及工作。党中央召开知识分子会议的时候，也作了科学普及报告；今年四月中共中央宣传部召开的科学工作座谈会中，也组织了十个科学新成就的报告，同时统一布置了有关部门的科学普及工作。
    其次，全国绝大部分科学家热心从事科学普及工作。这，只要看看全国科学技术普及协会和各地科学技术普及协会，组织各地科学技术工作人员积极参加科学普及宣传活动的情况，就可以知道了。
    第三，中国人民需要科学普及工作。全国总工会、青年团中央、中国人民解放军总政治部先后和全国科学普及协会发出了联合通知，要各地把科学普及当做经常工作。这几个单位，代表着几百万几千万工人、农民、士兵、青少年和机关干部，它们告诉我们，中国人民需要科学，需要科学家多做普及工作。
    第四，国际朋友需要我们多做科学普及工作。苏联、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国及其他人民民主国家的科学普及协会都同我们交换刊物。今年四月初，全苏政治和科学知识普及协会主席奥巴林院士为出席世界科学工作者协会十周年来我国，曾经要求我们编辑关于第一个五年计划和关于农业合作化的两种小册子，并且要求我们今后把新中国的事情通过全苏政治和科学普及协会多多介绍给苏联人民。
    在这样的形势下，中国科学家还能一花独放吗？不能。我们必须“百花齐放”。
    “百花”，说花的种类多，朵数多，不单调。
    “齐放”，说花开得齐。满山一齐开，满园一齐开，满树一齐开，不是零零落落地开。
    科学普及工作也是一样。
    要宣传门类多：物理、数学、技术科学、医药卫生、地质、地理、化学、化工、生物、农、林、水利、气象，等等，分门别类，应有尽有。
    要宣传阵地多：讲演、广播、期刊、副刊、小册子、电影、幻灯、展览，各式各样，应有尽有。
    要宣传次数多：例如讲演，1955年全国讲演了12，294次，而今年，根据预计，单是对工人讲演，就需要近四十万次，加上青年团、部队、文化系统和农村，就需要五十万次。
    而且像开花一样，不但要开得多，还要开得好，要让工人、农民、士兵、青少年、机关干部听了或者看了人人满足，人人得到很多的益处。
    这就是科学普及工作的“百花齐放”。
    如何才能实现这个理想？这不得不要求科学技术普及协会贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针。如何才能做到“百家争鸣”？这不得不要求科学技术普及协会中各个专门性学组，如物理学组、土木学组、气象学组等多多地负起责任来。
    依照苏联的经验，要把科学普及工作搞好，必须通过专门性的组织，来发挥科学家的潜力，提高工作的质量。这组织就是“学组”。
    学组的任务是，拟订宣传计划和宣传题目，组织文稿，推荐宣传人员，讨论稿件内容，研究群众反映，提出改进意见，等等。就是说，要“百家鸣”，要“百家争”。
    “鸣”，是公开讨论，自由发表意见，尽量提出批评。
      “争”，是争论，争辩。我们是为人民服务的，为了满足人民的需要，为了使人民得到更多的利益，最好每一篇文稿，那怕是名作家的，必须经过学组审查和修改，每一次讲演，那怕是前辈讲的，必须由学组研究听众意见，举出缺点，提出改进的意见。当然，这样做是麻烦的，但工作却因百家的讨论而做得更完善。必须指出，科学普及文章和科学研究报告不同。它是写给非专业的人看的。必须深入浅出，写得通俗。而要保证文章通俗，不能凭作者一个人的看法，必须通过学组中多数人的评定，才比较可靠。这里，我讲一个故事：唐朝大诗人白居易，做了诗，往往读给他家里的女佣人听，如果他家里的女佣人听不懂，他就认为他的文字不通俗，马上就改，改到女佣人听懂才满足。从这一方面来说，这真是科学普及工作者的一个好榜样。
    “争”，又是竞争，也就是社会主义劳动竞赛。学组同学组，个人同个人，都要比较，看谁“鸣”得更多，“鸣”得更好听。
    这就是科学普及工作的“百家争鸣”。
    这样做，科学普及工作会一步一步地改进，劳动人民的知识会一点一点地增加，科学普及协会也会一天一天地发展。
    总而言之，在学组里，最重要的问题，我以为只有两个。第一个问题是：用什么东西来为人民服务，即科学普及工作的内容怎样？回答是，“百花齐放”；第二个问题是：怎样做好科学普及工作？回答是“百家争鸣”。
