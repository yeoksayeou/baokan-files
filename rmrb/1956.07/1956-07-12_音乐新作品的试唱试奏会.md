    New Music Works Audition and Concert
    Qixin
    On the evening of July 5th, this year's third "New Works Audition and Concert" was held at the Beijing Theater, where many composers brought their new works for audition or concert, inviting friends from the music circle to appreciate them. The next day, a forum was held under the auspices of the Chinese Musicians Association, and the authors solicited many valuable opinions. The speakers also said that this form of audition and concert is good and encourages and promotes musical creation activities.
    At this new works audition and concert, the Central Philharmonic Choir sang composer Qu Xixian's new work "Red Army Base Chorus." This song has seven parts, using music to sing the revolutionary storm that swept across southern China after 1927, and also expresses the heroic struggle of the people in the difficult years and the sincere gratitude of the people in the "Old Red Areas" to the Party after liberation. Ma Sicong's new work "Huai River Chorus" also met with the audience. This chorus has folk songs and dance music; there are choruses and solos. It depicts the heroic achievements of millions of people responding to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao to harness the Huai River. Musician Lao Zhicheng personally played the recently composed piano solos "Spring on the Prairie" and "In the Forest." The Central Broadcasting Orchestra Choir and the New Song Audition Group of the Chinese Musicians Association also sang the newly compiled and adapted "Mongolian Suite," the Li ethnic folk song "The Girl Changed Her Mind" from Dongfang County, Hainan Island, and the Hunan Jiangling folk song "De De Tune," which were all well received by the audience. The newly created military music ensemble and concerto "Youth March" and "Red Army Liberates Nanggoucha" also aroused great interest.
    This year, the Chinese Musicians Association has successively held three such new music works audition and concerts to help authors improve the artistic level of their works and widely introduce new works. Before each audition and concert, the Chinese Musicians Association first hands over the new works of members and young musicians to music performance groups for rehearsal; sometimes small audition and concerts are held, and while performing, music workers who are invited to appreciate the music are asked to listen and talk at the same time, exchanging opinions. Sometimes, large-scale audition and concerts are also held, followed by forums. Each meeting produces many good works welcomed by the audience. At the second new works audition and concert in late May, the new work "Dragon Lantern Dance" by the famous violin composer Ma Sicong was performed. This violin solo is based on a folk dance from Guangdong. Musician Ma Ke also published a lyrical song "Strange Girl."

    音乐新作品的试唱试奏会
    岂心
    七月五日的夜晚，在北京剧场举行了今年的第三次“新作品试唱试奏会”，许多作曲家把自己的新作品拿来试唱或试奏，请音乐界的朋友们欣赏。第二天，在中国音乐家协会主持下又进行了座谈，作者征求到不少宝贵的意见。发言的人们还这样说，这样试唱试奏会的形式好，鼓励和推动了音乐创作活动。
    在这次新作品试唱试奏会上，中央乐团合唱团演唱了作曲家瞿希贤的新作品“红军根据地大合唱”。这支歌曲有七部分，运用音乐歌颂了1927年以后在祖国南方卷起的革命风暴，也表达了在艰苦年代里人民的英勇斗争和解放后“老红区”人民感谢党的赤诚心意。马思聪的新作品“淮河大合唱”也和听众见面了。这首合唱有山歌，也有舞曲；有合唱，也有独唱。它描绘出千万人响应党和毛主席的号召修淮河的英雄业迹。音乐家老志诚亲自演奏了新近创作的钢琴独奏曲“草原上的春天”和“在森林中”。中央广播乐团合唱队和中国音乐家协会新歌试唱团还分别演唱了作曲家新编和改编的“蒙古组曲”、海南岛东方县黎族民歌“姑娘变了心”和湖南江凌民歌“嘚嘚调”等，这些都博得听众的好评。作曲家新创作的军乐合奏及协奏曲“青年进行曲”、“红军解放南沟岔”等也都引起人们很大的兴趣。
    中国音乐家协会今年已陆续举行了三次像这样的音乐新作品试唱试奏会，帮助作者提高作品艺术水平，并广泛介绍新作品。在每次试唱试奏会前，音协先将会员和青年音乐工作者的新作品交给音乐演奏团体排练；有时举行小型试唱试奏会，在演奏同时，就请到会欣赏的音乐工作者随听随谈，交换意见。有时也办大型的试唱试奏会，会后再座谈。每次会都涌现出许多受听众欢迎的好作品。在五月下旬的第二次新作品试唱试奏会上，演奏了著名提琴作曲家马思聪的新作品“跳龙灯”，这首小提琴独奏曲是根据广东一个民间舞曲编的。音乐家马可也发表了一首抒情歌“奇怪的姑娘”。
