　　The Crossroads of Europe
　　Belgium, it is said, is the crossroads of Western Europe. To the north is the Netherlands, to the south is France, to the east is Germany, and across the sea to the west are the British Isles. It is strategically located and has been invaded by foreign countries many times in history. The residents speak French and Flemish. We took a car from Paris to Brussels. When we arrived in Belgium, the scenery along the Meuse River was full of green hills and clear waters, which was very beautiful. Because Brussels was full of tourists, we stayed in the city of Namur, about 50 kilometers away from Brussels. This is a typical Western small town. The downtown area is crowded with people during the day, and it is surprisingly quiet at night. Only pubs—which are called ordinary people's clubs—and tobacco shops are still open.

　　We took a car to Brussels every day, and the highway passed through the large forest on the outskirts of the city. This forest added a layer of tranquility to Brussels. The famous Brussels Forest is very large, with branches of highways running through it. Many people drive around in the forest.

　　The people of Brussels showed the same interest in Chinese Peking Opera as the people of Paris. One of the largest daily newspapers said: "The people of Brussels welcomed the artists from Beijing with no less enthusiasm than the people of Paris. Perhaps we are not as excited as the people of Paris, but we appreciate Chinese Peking Opera with the same deep affection as the people of Paris."

　　Dead Port of Antwerp
　　The famous European port—Antwerp, Belgium—was on strike when we arrived in this city. Like all cities where many sailors often land, this city is full of hotels and tobacco shops; shops selling colorful souvenirs are filled with coral hairpins and necklaces, cheap postcards, and expensive jewelry. Belgium's light industry is quite developed, and this city also has many watch shops, filled with shiny watches and alarm clocks. In several small streets in the city center, there are small taverns with dim lights everywhere. Some have electric lights hanging at the door with the words "Dance Hall" written on them, which are said to be brothels.

　　Our Belgian friends arranged for us to visit one of the largest ports in Europe. Steamers waited in the canal for the tide to rise before opening the locks. Once the steamer left the canal, the open harbor was a completely different scene. What surprised us was that such a large harbor had become a dead port. Hundreds of cranes were not moving. Some ships were quietly moored at the dock, and sailors were smoking their pipes on the deck, looking lonely at the dock. The wharves, one after another, stretched for several kilometers, but there was no sound or movement. Under the scorching sun, it seemed as if everything was asleep.

    欧洲的十字路口
    比利时，据说是西欧的十字路口，向北是荷兰，向南是法国，向东是德国，向西一海之隔便是英伦三岛，地居要冲，在历史上曾经多次受外国侵略，居民一部分说法语，一部分说弗拉蒙语。我们从巴黎到布鲁塞尔是坐的汽车，到了比利时境，沿着麦司河的风景尽是青山绿水，很为美丽。因为布鲁塞尔正住满了游客，我们便住在离布鲁塞尔大约五十公里的那慕尔城。这是典型的西方小城，白天在闹市上人群熙攘，入夜后便出奇地安静，只有酒馆——这被称为普通人的俱乐部和烟草店还开着门。
    我们每天坐汽车到布鲁塞尔，公路便从这个城市郊外的大森林中穿过，这个森林使布鲁塞尔更染上了一层宁静的色彩。有名的布鲁塞尔森林很大，中间纵横着公路的支线，许多人开着车子在森林中游玩。
    布鲁塞尔人对中国京戏表现了和巴黎人同样的兴趣，一家最大的日报说：“布鲁塞尔人用不逊于巴黎人的热情欢迎了北京的艺术家，也许，我们不像巴黎人那么激动，但我们确以和巴黎人同样的深情欣赏了中国京剧”。
    死港安特卫普
    欧洲著名的大港——比利时的安特卫普，当我们到这个城市时，港口工人正举行着大罢工。正像所有经常有许多海员落脚的城市一样，这个城市到处都是酒店和烟草店；出卖五光十色的小纪念品的商店里摆着珊瑚发针和项练、不值钱的明信片和贵重的珠宝。比利时的轻工业相当发达，这个城市也有着许多的钟表店，摆满了闪光的手表和闹钟。而在市中心的好几条小街道中，到处是灯光暗淡的小酒馆。有的门口挂着写有“舞厅”字样的电灯，据说这是妓馆。
    比利时的朋友们安排我们去参观这个欧洲最大的港口之一，汽船在运河中等待着潮水上涨才开启船闸。汽船一出了运河，开阔的海港已完全是另外一种景色。使我们吃惊的是这么大的海港已经变成了一个死港，成百的起重机不动了，有些轮船静静地停在码头上，水手在甲板上寂寞地咬着烟斗向码头那边看着。好几公里长的岸边一个接着一个的码头，但一点人声和动静都没有，在烈日之下更显得像一切都睡了一样。
