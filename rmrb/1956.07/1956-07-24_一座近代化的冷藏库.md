    A Modern Cold Storage
    (By our newspaper) A four-story building with few windows has recently been completed in Shiliuzhuang, Nanyuan. This is a cold storage that will be officially put into use in October this year. This cold storage can hold 3,200 tons of meat, aquatic products, vegetables, eggs, fruits, chickens and ducks.
    The design of the cold storage is the most advanced. The partition walls in the warehouse are all made of insulating foam concrete. There are elevators and trolley tracks inside the warehouse. Trains and cars can go directly to the door of the cold storage. Many modern machines made in our country will be installed in the warehouse. Now the civil construction project of the warehouse has been completed, and workers are busy installing various equipment in the warehouse.
    At the end of July, a six-story cold storage building that can hold 9,000 tons of frozen food will be built next to this building.

    一座近代化的冷藏库
    本报讯　在南苑石榴庄新近建成了一座窗户很少的四层楼房，这就是将在今年十月可以正式使用的冷藏库。这个冷藏库可装三千二百吨的肉类、水产、蔬菜、蛋品、水果和鸡鸭。
    冷藏库的设计是最先进的。库里的隔断墙都用的是保温的泡沫混凝土。库里面有电梯和滑车轨道。火车和汽车能直通到冷藏库的门口。库里将安装许多我国自制的近代化机器。现在仓库的土木建筑工程已经完成，工人们正忙碌地安装库里的各种设备。
    七月底，在这个楼的旁边，还要兴建一个能装九千吨冷藏食物六层高楼的冷藏库。
