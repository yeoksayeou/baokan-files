    A Report from Real Life
    By our reporter Lin Mo
    On the long table in the conference room were several shiny pieces of ore. People gathered around, admiring and discussing them:
    "This isn't ore; it's practically pure metal!"
    "This is sphalerite, with a zinc content of over 90%."
    "What's this one? – Lead-zinc ore?"
    I picked up a fist-sized piece of ore; it was as heavy as a piece of steel.
    These ores were brought back from Hulunbuir League by Comrade Yang Zhilin, Deputy Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee. There are now dozens of exploration teams there, searching for various precious and rare mineral deposits on the grasslands and in the forests.
    Comrade Yang Zhilin went to Hulunbuir League to work for half a month not long ago. He traveled to many places and had extensive contact with the masses. At the end of June, he gave a report to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It was a fresh and vivid report from real life. Through this report, people saw a rich corner of the motherland – the magnificent construction picture of Hulunbuir League and the various sharp contradictions and struggles existing in the construction work.
    Listening to the report, it was as if the vast expanse of the Greater Khingan Mountains, like a green ocean, appeared before people – the treasure house of the motherland's forests, accounting for one-fifth of the country's forest area, the loggers working hard in the forest, trains dragging long lines of timber, spewing white smoke. There were also dozens of newly established state-owned ranches on the grassland, exploration teams with red flags everywhere, and Dalai Lake, a fish lake in the grasslands that stretched for hundreds of miles like an ocean. "People describe the fish in this lake: the deeper the water, the thicker the fish," Comrade Yang Zhilin introduced.
    The abundance of resources and the vigorously developing construction picture were exciting and pride-inducing, but even more inspiring were the urgent problems in construction work raised by Comrade Yang Zhilin:
      "To better build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the relevant departments in the region should regard supporting the construction of the new areas as the most important task." Comrade Yang Zhilin said: "But the current situation is not like this. Many teams engaged in construction in the new areas are fighting alone there. Other departments do not cooperate or cooperate poorly. There are many problems with the supply of grain, vegetables, and various material and cultural needs, and the workers and masses have many complaints." He listed many facts about the backwardness of supply work: the Dalai Lake Fishing Ground has six or seven hundred workers during the production season, but there is not even a small vendor there. Some of the state-owned ranches established on the grasslands have hundreds of employees, but the commercial, cultural, educational, and health departments do not establish institutions there. The employees in the forest areas are even more vocal: there are few shops, few goods, the goods are not good, and the prices are high. And timely supply of vegetables is almost the cry of every employee in the forest area. There are five or six thousand employees in Haolibao in the forest area, but there are very few supply points. Comrade Yang Zhilin said: "I saw with my own eyes that many family members of the employees had to take the train to buy daily necessities from afar." According to the leaders of the forest area, the state-owned stores sell vegetables expensively and the supply is insufficient, but they do not allow the local enterprises to purchase directly, preferring to let the employees suffer. Comrade Yang Zhilin said angrily: "If you can't shit yourself, you insist on occupying the latrine; this is really outrageous!"
    "We have long proposed that more economic centers should be established in Inner Mongolia. This is an extremely important measure to build Inner Mongolia, change the backward face of the autonomous region, and change the de facto inequality of ethnic minorities left over from history. Now, many factories, large and small, dozens of state-owned ranches, abundant fishing grounds, and huge forest industries have appeared on our grasslands. This is something that people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia could not have dreamed of in the past. In these places, if various departments systematically build shops, schools, and establish banks and post and telecommunications institutions, and gradually attract the masses to live here, wouldn't they gradually form economic centers in pastoral areas, forest areas, and fishing areas? If we leave these places, where else can we establish economic centers?"
    Comrade Yang Zhilin proposed that the supply of materials to the new areas should also be solved by developing production locally. At present, the forest areas, pastoral areas, fishing grounds, and some towns in Hulunbuir League need to transport 80,000 tons of grain from other places every year. The Yaqeshi to Genhe line in the forest area alone imported 810,000 yuan worth of vegetables from other places last year. However, many employees still often cannot eat vegetables. Now, even things like pickles and soy sauce have to be transported by train from thousands of miles away. Moreover, the population of the new areas is increasing rapidly. For example, the population of Xiguitu Banner in the forest area increased from 20,000 to 90,000 in five years. It is difficult to meet the needs if all kinds of daily necessities are supplied from other places. Moreover, some things can be organized and produced by local forces. He suggested establishing farmland and vegetable farms locally; the commercial departments should also consider establishing grain and non-staple food processing plants in the forest areas; and at the same time, mobilize the employees' families and local people to grow vegetables and raise livestock and poultry in large quantities.
    Hulunbuir League has great production potential. People familiar with the local resources say that there are treasures everywhere here, within reach. Every one of the league's seventeen major rivers produces fish. There are more than 80 kinds of by-products in the forest area, and agaric and mushrooms are everywhere; the wild grapes all over the mountains are good raw materials for winemaking. Even cow hair and dog wool are valuable in the pastoral area. It is estimated that nearly 10,000 tons of scrap steel abandoned by the Japanese puppet troops in the past can still be collected.
    However, due to the lack of comprehensive planning for production, insufficient contact and cooperation between the relevant departments, and failure to make full and rational use of financial and material resources, serious losses and waste have even been caused. For example, there is a large pickle factory left by the enemy and puppets in Hailar, with good equipment, and the pickles produced can be eaten by tens of thousands of people. But we did not use it, and demolished a large number of machines, so that now we have to transport soy sauce and pickles from other places. In the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, after logging and railway construction, a large amount of timber was abandoned in the mountain gullies and roadsides. It is estimated that the finished standing poles and sleepers alone are more than 200,000 cubic meters, worth tens of millions. In the past, the forest industry and the forest management departments both emphasized difficulties and shirked responsibility to each other, and no one carried out cleaning up, and the local government did not vigorously organize the masses to enter the mountains to clean up, allowing these timbers to rot in the mountains. On the other hand, many towns in Inner Mongolia lack timber for construction; many herdsmen in Hulunbuir League want to build houses and settle down, but they cannot get timber; even some farmers near the forest area feel that timber is difficult to obtain! It's like a person holding a bun and letting it spoil, but his stomach is starving. Comrade Yang Zhilin repeatedly said: "This is really a strange thing! There are really many such strange things!"
    Comrade Yang Zhilin's report involved many problems in industrial, agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production and the lives of the masses, and put forward many concrete suggestions on how the Party committee should strengthen its leadership over forestry work and the overall planning and mutual cooperation of certain construction work. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee will specifically study and deal with these problems and suggestions. Because Comrade Yang Zhilin went to the scene in person, extensively contacted the masses, and understood some major and urgent problems that needed to be solved, the two-hour report made everyone deeply impressed by the many problems he raised, and prompted people to think about how to solve these many problems.
    In the conference room of the Party committee, people often listen to reports, but many reports, like a string of gray trains, hurriedly pass through the conference agenda. The vague and faint impression it leaves on people also disappears immediately. Here, I once again recalled what Comrade Mao Zedong had repeatedly said to some leading cadres: they must go out of the office, get closer to the masses, and study problems more.

    一次来自现实生活的汇报
    本报记者　林沫
    会议室的长桌上放着几块闪闪发光的矿石，人们围在那里赞赏着，议论着：
    “这哪里是矿石，简直是纯金属！”
    “这是闪锌矿，含锌量在90％以上。”
    “这一块是什么？——是铅锌矿？”
    我拿起一块拳头大的矿石，沉重得就像一块钢铁。
    这些矿石是中共内蒙古自治区委员会副书记、内蒙古自治区人民委员会副主席杨植霖同志从呼伦贝尔盟带回来的。那里现在有几十个勘查队，在草原上和森林里寻找各种贵重的、稀有的矿藏。
    杨植霖同志不久以前到呼伦贝尔盟工作了半个来月，他走了许多地方，广泛地接触了群众。六月末的一天，他向中共内蒙古自治区委员会作汇报。这是一次来自现实生活的新鲜而生动的汇报。透过这个汇报，人们看到了祖国富饶的一角——呼伦贝尔盟雄伟壮阔的建设图景和建设工作中所存在的各种尖锐矛盾和斗争。
    听着汇报，如像在人们面前出现了那纵横千里像绿色海洋一样的大兴安岭森林——那占全国森林面积五分之一的祖国林叶的宝库，在森林里紧张劳动的伐木工人，拖着长长的木材行列、喷吐着白烟的火车。还有那草原上新建立的几十处国营牧场，到处插着红旗的勘查队，以及那方圆数百里像海洋似的草原上的鱼湖——达赉湖。“人们形容这湖里的鱼：水有多深，鱼就有多厚。”杨植霖同志介绍说。
    物产的丰富和蓬勃开展的建设图景是令人兴奋和自豪的，但更加激动人心的还是杨植霖同志所提出的建设工作中所存在的迫切问题：
      “为了更好地建设内蒙古自治区，地方上的各有关部门应该把支援新区的建设作为头等重要的任务”。杨植霖同志说：“但是目前的情况却不是这样。许多在新区进行建设的队伍，却是在那里孤军奋斗。其他部门不加以配合或配合的很差，粮食、蔬菜及各种物质、文化生活的供应存在很多问题，职工群众很有意见。”他列举了很多供应工作落后的事实：达赉湖渔场在生产季节有六、七百工人，但那里连一个小摊贩都没有。设在草原上的国营牧场，有的一处有数百职工，但商业、文教和卫生部门却都不在那里建立机构。林区的职工更是议论纷纷：商店少，货物少，东西不好，价钱又贵。而及时供应蔬菜，几乎是林区每个职工的呼声。林区好里堡有五、六千职工，但供应点很少。杨植霖同志说：“我亲眼看到那里很多职工家属，不得不坐火车到远处购买日用品。”据林区的领导人员反映，国营商店卖的蔬菜贵，而且供应不足，可是他们又不允许当地企业部门直接去采购，宁肯让职工受困难。杨植霖同志气愤地说：“自己不拉屎，硬要占着毛坑，这实在是岂有此理！”
    “我们早就提出，要在内蒙古多多建立经济中心。这是建设内蒙古和改变自治区的落后面貌、改变少数民族由历史上遗留下来的事实上的不平等现象的一种极为重要的措施。如今在我们的草原上出现了不少大大小小的工厂，几十处国营牧场，出产丰富的渔场和巨大的森林工业。这实在是内蒙古各族人民过去所梦想不到的事情。在这些地方，各部门如果有计划地去盖商店，办学校，设立银行和邮电机构，逐渐吸引群众到这里居住下来，不就逐渐形成了牧区、林区和渔业的经济中心吗？离开了这些地方，还要到哪里去建立经济中心呢？”
    杨植霖同志提出，对新区的物质供应同时还要从在本地开展生产中求得解决。目前在呼伦贝尔盟的林区、牧区、渔场和部分城镇，每年要从外地调运八万吨粮食。仅林区的牙克石到根河一线，去年就从外地运入价值八十一万元的蔬菜。但是，许多职工还经常吃不到蔬菜。现在甚至连咸菜、酱油这一类的东西，都要用火车从千里外运来。而新区的人口增加很快，如林区的喜桂图旗五年内人口由二万增加到九万。各种生活用品全靠外地供应，就很难满足需要。而且有些东西是完全可以组织和发挥当地力量进行生产的。他建议在当地建立农田和蔬菜农场；商业部门也应考虑在林区建立粮食及副食品加工厂；同时发动职工家属和当地群众大量种菜和饲养家畜、家禽等。
    呼伦贝尔盟的生产潜力很大。熟悉当地资源的情况的人说，这里遍地资财，伸手可得。全盟的十七条主要河流，每条河里都产鱼。林区有八十多种副业产品，木耳、蘑菇到处都有；遍山的野葡萄更是制酒的好原料。牧区连牛毛、狗绒都很值钱。过去日伪军遗弃下的废钢铁，估计还可以搜集近万吨。
    但是，由于对生产缺乏全面的规划，各有关部门互相联系和配合不够，财力、物力得不到充分的合理的运用，甚至造成严重的损失和浪费。如在海拉尔有敌伪遗留下的一个很大的酱菜厂，设备很好，生产出来的酱菜可供十数万人食用。而我们却不加利用，把大量器械拆毁，以至现在要从外地运进酱油、酱菜。在大兴安岭林区，采伐林木和修过铁路以后，山沟、路旁遗弃了大量木材，据估计，单是成材的站杆、道木即在二十万立方公尺以上，价值千万。过去森林工业和经营林木部门双方强调困难，互相推诿，谁也不进行清理，而当地政府也没有大力组织群众进山清理，一任这些木材腐烂在山中。另一方面，内蒙古不少城镇进行建设又缺乏木材；呼伦贝尔盟有许多牧民，想盖房子定居，就是搞不到木材；甚至连林区附近有些农民也感到木材困难！这就好像，一个人手里拿着馒头让它坏掉，而肚子却饿得发慌。杨植霖同志一再说：“这实在是怪事情！这样的怪事可实在不少哩！”
    杨植霖同志的汇报，涉及到工、农、林、牧业生产和群众生活中的许多问题，并且对党委如何加强对林区工作的领导及某些建设工作的全面计划和互相配合问题提出了许多具体建议，内蒙自治区委员会将具体研究处理这些问题和建议。由于杨植霖同志亲临现场，广泛接触群众，了解了某些重大的迫切需要解决的问题，所以，在两个钟头的汇报中，使大家对他所提出的许多问题有了深刻的印象，而且促使人们去思考怎样解决这许多问题。
    在党委的会议室里，人们常听汇报，但是有不少汇报，就像一串灰色的列车一样，匆匆忙忙地从会议日程上开过去了。它给人们所留下的模糊的、淡淡的印象，也随即消失了。在这里，我再一次想起毛泽东同志对一些领导人员多次所讲过的：须要走出办公室去，多多接近群众，多多研究问题。
