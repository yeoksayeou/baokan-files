    Some Thoughts on the "Three Mountains" of Peking Opera
    Wu Zuguang
    It can be said that "it never rains but it pours." On the Beijing stage, three Peking operas have appeared simultaneously in new guises and met with audiences. These three Peking operas are: "Luo Shengjiao" performed by the Qiqihar Peking Opera Troupe of Heilongjiang Province, "Ahei and Ashima" performed by the National Defense Peking Opera Troupe of Yunnan Province, and "Three Mountains" performed by the Second Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theater. The performances of these three operas in Beijing show that our respectable Peking Opera workers are not content with adhering to conventions and are trying to break through the original "defenses" of Peking Opera performing arts; this "defense line" should be said to be difficult to break through, but it has finally been broken through. The performances of these three programs have cost the hard work of many intelligent and hardworking people. They have won applause and added color to the active June Beijing stage.
    Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I was unable to see the play "Luo Shengjiao." I saw "Ahei and Ashima" earlier, and the impression is faint. Here I can only talk about my impressions after watching "Three Mountains."
    "Three Mountains" is a famous opera of the Mongolian People's Republic. In the Mongolian People's Republic, it is loved by the people of the whole country. The Mongolian composer B. Damdinsuren won the Choibalsan Prize for this play.
    The story of "Three Mountains" is: Half a century ago, in the days when the people were oppressed, a group of hardworking hunters lived under the three mountains of the Mongolian grasslands. The young and brave hunter Yunden and the smart and beautiful girl Nansilema were engaged, and the people on the grassland congratulated them. But just as Yunden went to the city to buy wedding supplies, Nansilema was seen by the cunning female housekeeper of the Wangfu, Haolema. Under violence, Nansilema was robbed into the mansion by the fierce Prince Balagan.
    Because of the steadfastness of Nansilema and Yunden's love, and because of the bravery and wit of the hunters, they did not succumb to the violence, but instead launched successive struggles. Finally, under the three mountains, they fought with the prince's thugs. This is a "struggle for survival," and justice finally prevailed.
    The theater effect of this play is very good. The adapted script is very concise and the layout is rigorous. The love scenes between Yunden, played by actor Zhang Yunxi, and Nansilema, played by Yun Yanming, are performed very sincerely and movingly, especially the scene where they are both tied up in the Wangfu. The final grand fight scene fully utilizes the advantages of the rich Peking Opera martial arts techniques, based on the environment of the stage design. It even makes people feel that using Peking Opera performances to express such combat scenes may be the most appropriate form. When this exciting story comes to the final scene—when the fierce prince and his thugs abandon their armor and flee—it can really cheer up the whole audience and make people feel happy.
    Veteran actors had performed foreign stories in the form of Peking Opera decades ago. However, the performance of "Three Mountains" adopts the multi-act method of grand opera. In terms of performance, there are new group dances, in terms of singing, Peking Opera gongs and drums and singing styles are used, plus a variety of tunes and even Mongolian tunes; for the audience, it is fresh and eye-catching. Its tense plot and moving performances have been welcomed by the audience, and its some not-so-mature artistic treatment methods have also aroused a lot of discussion among the audience.
    After watching "Three Mountains," according to the reactions I heard, there are generally two types: one is that they are satisfied, and the other is that "this doesn't look like Peking Opera."
    My personal opinion is biased towards the former. I think that a play is performed on the stage, and because it is reasonable and vivid, it moves the audience and further educates them, it should be said that it has achieved the purpose of the performance. At least it can be said that it has basically been successful.
    As for the saying that "it doesn't look like Peking Opera," that is a matter of performance method, and it is a matter of the overall artistic design of the play.
    On this point, I would like to talk about my opinion.
    In the entire performance of "Three Mountains," what makes many viewers feel uncomfortable is probably the dialogue problem. In the traditional Peking Opera performance method, the dialogue is divided into two types: "yunbai" and "jingbai": "Yunbai" is close to the dialects of Hubei and Anhui; "Jingbai" is Beijing dialect with rhythm. In Peking Opera performances, generally speaking, old male roles, qingyi (virtuous female role), martial male roles, young male roles, and painted face roles say "yunbai"; certain types of clown roles and young female roles say "jingbai." In traditional Peking Opera, there are significant differences in makeup and costumes between male, female, painted face, and clown roles. This distinction between roles and their saying "jingbai" or "yunbai" is unified. However, in "Three Mountains," the actors have no other differences in makeup and costumes except for differences in age and tone, and they are all dressed like in real life. In the eyes of the audience, they are all hunters under the three mountains of Mongolia; plus the negative characters in the Wangfu, they are all Mongolians. Therefore, when several people in the play are talking, some say "yunbai" and some say "jingbai," which becomes an incomprehensible phenomenon. Most of the audience does not consider: Comrade Zhang Yunxi is a Peking Opera martial male role and is used to saying "yunbai"; Comrade Zhang Chunhua is a Peking Opera clown role and is used to saying "jingbai." In the eyes of the audience, now they are both Mongolian hunters, growing up in the same place, but they are speaking two languages ​​in their conversation. This will inevitably make people feel unreasonable and untrue, and will inevitably affect the performance effect.
    The reason why "Three Mountains" does not look like Peking Opera, I think, is mainly still the problem of three-dimensional scenery. This is an old problem, and many people have discussed it for a long time, but here it is still an unresolved problem. Traditional Peking Opera, that is, Peking Opera that ordinary audiences are familiar with, basically does not use scenery; it uses the performance of actors to complete the tasks of scenery, props, and time conversion everywhere. It should be said that this is one of the biggest characteristics of Peking Opera. Precisely because of this, Peking Opera has its own set of traditional performance methods. It can use eight "extras" to represent thousands of troops, it can use three or five people to represent a large crowd, and it can use special costumes, makeup, and special gongs and drums to highlight the main characters. Now, because "Three Mountains" uses realistic scenery, in order to coordinate with the style of the scenery, the above-mentioned Peking Opera performance methods cannot be used at all. Many scenes, especially the crowd song and dance scenes at the beginning and end, are completely scenes from dramas or new song and dance dramas, and have nothing in common with Peking Opera that ordinary audiences are familiar with. The day I watched the play, I met Comrade Wang Kunlun when I left the theater. He smiled and said, "In the end, it became the 'Central Song and Dance Troupe' again." He probably meant that it didn't look like Peking Opera at the beginning, there were places that looked like Peking Opera in the middle, and it didn't look like Peking Opera again at the end.
    Applying realistic three-dimensional scenery to the Peking Opera stage is not a small matter. It is contradictory and conflicting with the traditional performance methods of Peking Opera. Realistic scenery inevitably requires actors' performances to be as realistic as possible, close to life; this will inevitably run counter to Peking Opera's highly refined and freehand performance methods.
    In fact, the script of "Three Mountains" itself is not a "Peking Opera" script. Its act and scene divisions have completely adopted the form of a new opera.
    In general, if there are still problems with the performance of "Three Mountains," it is a matter of unified style.
    I say this not to oppose the "new Peking Opera" using realistic scenery. On the contrary, because the current performance of "Three Mountains" is loved by the majority of audiences, I believe that it can also be continuously revised based on the existing foundation to gradually unify its style. For example, the dialogue problem, if the actors are willing to give up their past habits and uniformly change to "jingbai," it can easily achieve unity. Precisely because of this, I feel that whether it is because the traditional concept of "Peking Opera" has restricted our new and bolder creation? Can we imagine that programs like "Three Mountains," "Luo Shengjiao," and "Ahei and Ashima" can be free from the constraints of the term "Peking Opera"? Can we not perform them as "Peking Opera," but as our nation's new song and dance drama? We should create such a new song and dance drama, which can perform modern life and ancient life; it can perform Chinese life and foreign life. It is not the "Peking Opera" whose form has been quite solidified and which we imagine under the old concept. It is a new song and dance drama. In its performance, it can absorb the rich and colorful performance methods of Chinese classical opera that have been tempered and passed down over a long period of time, and at the same time, it can fully utilize modern scientific conditions in terms of scenery and lighting, so that it can achieve a complete and realistic integration with the actors' performances. In this way, in terms of performance, we can freely choose what we need and not what we don't need. Our performances will no longer be said by the audience to be "not like Peking Opera" or other dramas; because what we perform is not "Peking Opera" at all, and our road is wider than Peking Opera. The question of "whether it looks like Peking Opera" will not be within our consideration.
    I think we must create a new type of song and dance drama with national characteristics. The performance methods of our classical opera should be the most important direction of our study. Because even on a global scale, the highly excellent performance of our classical opera is unique, whether in terms of singing or dancing.
    Through the performance of "Three Mountains" and the other two programs, can we think that we have opened up the road for the "Central Experimental Opera Theater" and the "Central Song and Dance Troupe"... to create our nation's new opera and new dance drama?
    As "Peking Opera," "Three Mountains" has made great reforms. However, if my idea can be established, some of the current reforms of "Three Mountains" are not too many; but are restricted and not bold enough.
    The performance of "Three Mountains" has undergone a long period of preparation and has received strong assistance from artists from the Mongolian People's Republic; whether it is the playwrights, directors, or actors, they have all put in hard work. The achievements they have obtained are obvious, and the welcome they have received from the audience is also obvious. The joys and pains and gains and losses of these hardworking creators in their long-term labor are by no means something that I, a careless audience member who has only watched the performance once, can appreciate. It should be said that I love this play very much and am very grateful for the hard work of the comrades. But I also have some immature ideas, which I wrote out for reference.

    对京剧“三座山”的一些想法
    吴祖光
    真可以说“无独有偶”，在北京的舞台上，同时出现了三出以新的面貌和观众相见的京剧。这三出京剧是：黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市京剧团演出的“罗盛教”，云南省的国防京剧团演出的“阿黑与阿诗玛”，中国京剧院二团演出的
  “三座山”。三出戏在北京的演出，说明了我们可尊敬的京剧工作者不甘于局守成规，企图突破京剧表演艺术原有的“防线”；这道“防线”应该说是很难突破的，但是它终于被突破了。这三个节目的演出不知耗费了多少聪明而又刻苦的人们的心血。他们赢得了喝采，为活跃的六月北京的舞台增加了颜色。
    可惜的是，由于没有抽出时间，“罗盛教”这个戏我没能看到。“阿黑与阿诗玛”看得较早，印象淡了。这里我只能把“三座山”的观后感谈一下。
      “三座山”是蒙古人民共和国的著名的歌剧。在蒙古人民共和国，它受到全国人民的喜爱。蒙古作曲家伯·达木丁苏荣并由于本剧获得了乔巴山奖金。
      “三座山”的故事是：在半个世纪以前，人民受压迫的日子里，蒙古大草原的三座山下住着一群勤劳的猎人。年轻勇敢的猎手云登和聪明美丽的姑娘南斯勒玛订婚了，草原上的人们纷纷向他俩祝贺。可是就在云登进城去买结婚用品的时候，南斯勒玛被狡猾的王府女管家好尔勒玛看见了。在暴力之下南斯勒玛被凶恶的巴拉干王爷抢进府去。
    由于南斯勒玛和云登对于爱情的坚贞，由于猎户们的英勇机智，他们没有屈服于强暴，相反地展开了接二连三的斗争。最后，在三座山下他们和王爷的打手们搏斗起来。这是“死里求活”的搏斗，正义终于得到了胜利。
    这个戏的剧场效果很好。改编后的剧本很简练，布局严谨。演员张云溪饰演的云登和云燕铭饰演的南斯勒玛的爱情场面，尤其是在王府内双双就缚的一场表演得很诚挚动人。全剧最后一场的大开打，根据舞台设计的环境，充分发挥了丰富了京剧武打技术的优点，甚至使人觉得：用京剧的表演来表现这样的战斗场面，很可能是最恰当的形式。这个激动人心的故事演到最后一场——凶恶的王爷和他的打手们弃甲曳兵而逃时，真能叫全场振奋，人心大快。
    前辈的演员早在几十年前就用京剧的形式表演过外国的故事。但是“三座山”的演出采用了大歌剧式的分幕方法。在表演上又有新的舞蹈的集体舞、在歌唱上用京剧的锣鼓和唱腔、又加上了多种的曲调以至于蒙古调；对观众说来它是新鲜的、惹人注目的。它的紧张的剧情和动人的表演受到了观众的欢迎，它的还不是十分成熟的一些艺术处理的方法也引起了许多观众的议论。
    看过“三座山”后，据我听到的反应，一般说来有两种：一种是认为满意的，一种是认为“这不像京剧”。
    我个人的意见是偏于前者的。我认为一个戏在舞台上演出了，由于它合情合理，有声有色，而使观众受到感动，进而受到了教育，这就应该说它是达到了演出的目的的。至少可以说，在基本上是得到了成功的。
    至于“不像京剧”的说法，那是表现方法的问题，是全剧的艺术设计的问题。
    就这一点，我谈一下我的意见。
    在“三座山”的整个演出当中，首先使许多观众感觉不舒服的恐怕就是对话问题。在京剧的传统表演方法里，对话分为“韵白”和
  “京白”两种：“韵白”相近于湖北、安徽的方音；“京白”则是带有韵律性的北京话。在京剧的表演里，一般说来老生、青衣、武生、小生、花脸之类的角色说“韵白”；某种类型的丑角和花旦说“京白”。而在传统的京剧中生、旦、净、丑在化装、服饰上就有显著的区分，这种角色的区分和他的说“京白”或“韵白”是统一的。而“三座山”里的演员在化装上和服饰上除年龄和色调的不同以外，没有什么其他的区别，就是生活里的打扮。在观众看来，他们都是蒙古三座山下的猎人；加上王爷府里的反面人物，他们都是蒙古人。因此，戏里面几个人在谈话的时候，有的说“韵白”，有的说“京白”，便成为不可理解的现象了。大多数的观众并不考虑：张云溪同志是京剧的武生，一向说惯了“韵白”；张椿华同志是京剧的丑角，一向说惯了“京白”。在观众看来，现在他们两人都是蒙古的猎户，生长在一处地方，可是在交谈中却讲着两种语言。这样必然会使人感觉不合理，不真实，必然会影响演出效果。
    说“三座山”不像京剧的原因，我想主要恐怕仍是立体布景的问题。这是一个老问题，很多人为此讨论过很久，但是在这里终于还是个没有解决的问题。传统的京剧，也即是一般观众熟悉的京剧是基本上不用布景的；它在任何地方都用演员的表演来完成布景以至于道具和时间转换的任务。应该说，这是京剧的最大的特点之一。正是这样，所以京剧有它一套传统的表演方法。它可以用八个“龙套”来代表千军万马，它可以用三、五个人代表大批群众，它可以用特殊的服装化装及特殊的锣鼓音响来突出主要的角色。现在由于“三座山”采用了现实的布景，为了和布景的风格协调，以上的一些京剧惯用的表演方法便完全使用不上。很多场面，特别显著的是开头和结尾的两场群众歌舞的场面，那完全是话剧或新歌舞剧的场面，和一般观众所熟悉的京剧毫无共通之处。我看戏的那天，散场时遇见王昆仑同志，他笑着说：“末了又变成‘中央歌舞团’了。”他的意思大概就是说，开始不像京剧，当中有像京剧的地方，而结尾又不像京剧了。
    把写实的立体布景应用在京剧舞台上不是一件小事情，它和京剧的传统的表演方法是矛盾的，抵触的。写实的布景必然要求演员的表演尽量地写实，接近生活；这样和京剧的高度的提炼到写意程度的表演方法必然是会背道而驰的。
    事实上，“三座山”的剧本本身就不是一个
  “京剧”剧本，它的分幕分场已经完全采用新歌剧的形式了。
    总的说来，“三座山”在演出上假如还存在着问题的话，那就是一个风格统一的问题。
    我这样说，并不是反对“新的京剧”应用写实的布景。正相反，由于目前“三座山”的演出受到了广大观众的喜爱，我相信，它也完全可以根据现有的基础不断地修改，使它的风格渐渐统一起来。譬如对话的问题，假如演员同志们愿意放弃过去的习惯，一律改用“京白”，很容易便可以取得统一。正因为这样，所以我倒觉得，是否是由于“京剧”这个传统的概念束缚了我们的新的更大胆的创造？我们是否可以设想：像“三座山”，以至于“罗盛教”、“阿黑与阿诗玛”这样的节目，都可以不受“京剧”这个名词的拘束？我们是否可以不把它们当作
  “京剧”来演出，而是作为我们民族的新歌舞剧？我们应当创造这样的新歌舞剧，它能表演现代生活，也能表演古代生活；它能表演中国的生活，也能表演外国的生活。它不是形式已经相当凝固了的、我们在旧的概念之下所想到的“京剧”，它是新的歌舞剧。在它的演出里面，既能吸收经过长久的时间千锤百炼而流传下来的中国古典戏曲的丰富多彩的表演方法，同时在布景和照明方面又能充分利用现代的科学条件，使之同演员的表演共同达到浑然一片的完整和真实。这样，我们在表演方面，可以自由地选择我们需要的，不要那些我们不需要的。我们的演出不会再被观众说是“不像京剧”，或别的什么剧；因为我们演出的根本不是“京剧”，我们的道路比京剧更宽。“像不像京剧”的问题将不在我们的考虑之内。
    我觉得，我们必需创造出具有民族特色的新型的歌舞剧。我们的古典戏曲的表演方法应当是我们最主要的学习的方向。因为就是扩大到世界的范围来说，我们的古典戏曲的高度的卓越的表演也是独一无二的，无论是在歌唱和舞蹈方面。
    通过“三座山”和其他两个节目的演出，我们是否可以认为是替“中央实验歌剧院”、“中央歌舞团”……为创造我们民族的新歌剧和新舞剧打开了道路？
    作为“京剧”来说，“三座山”是做了很大的改革的。然而假如我的想法能够成立的话，
  “三座山”目前的一些改革就不是太多；而是受着拘束，不够大胆。
      “三座山”的演出经过了长时期的准备，又得到蒙古人民共和国的艺术家的大力帮助；无论编剧、导演、演员同志们都付出了辛勤的劳动。他们所获得的成就是很显然的，他们受到观众的欢迎也是显然的。这些辛勤的创作者在他们长期劳动中的甘苦得失决不是我这个只匆匆看过一次演出的粗心的观众所能体会的。应该说：我很喜爱这个戏，很感谢同志们的辛劳。但是我也有一些不成熟的想法，写出来以供参考。
