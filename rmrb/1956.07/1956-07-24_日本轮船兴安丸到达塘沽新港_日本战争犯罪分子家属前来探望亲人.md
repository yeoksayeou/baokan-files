Xinhua News Agency, Tanggu New Port, 23rd - The Japanese ship "Xing'an Maru," which came to transport the second group of released Japanese war criminals back to their country, arrived at the Tianjin Tanggu New Port pier at 2:30 PM today.

Accompanying the ship were Rokuro Tomishina, representative of the Japanese Red Cross Society; Eiichi Kuronuma, representative of the Japan-China Friendship Association; Shijio Harada, representative of the Japan Peace Liaison Council; and Rokuro Mizuno, head of the Japan Red Cross Society's revitalization room and the person in charge of the "Xing'an Maru" ship. They were welcomed at the pier by Wu Shifa and Xue Xin, representatives of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society.

Nineteen Japanese journalists also came on the ship.

Twenty-five overseas Chinese from Japan and their families, accompanied by Wu Xiuzhu and four others, representatives of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, also arrived in Tianjin on the same ship. Representatives from the Tianjin Overseas Chinese Reception Station warmly received them at the New Port pier.

Nineteen family members of Japanese war criminals sentenced by the Chinese government also came to Tianjin on the "Xing'an Maru." They are preparing to go to Fushun and Taiyuan to visit their relatives. Among these family members is Ubu Utako, wife of Ubu Rokuzo, who has already been paroled.

Xinhua News Agency, Tanggu New Port, 23rd - The family members of Japanese war criminals who came to China on the Japanese ship "Xing'an Maru" told Xinhua reporters today that they were very grateful to the Chinese government for giving them the opportunity to visit their relatives. The Japanese war criminals they are visiting have recently been sentenced by the Chinese government.

Asahi Uesaka, the eldest son of war criminal Masaru Uesaka, said, "In addition to visiting our relatives, we all have the intention of personally apologizing to the Chinese people." He said, "The Chinese government did not kill a single war criminal, nor was anyone sentenced to life imprisonment. This is truly too lenient. We are really grateful to the Chinese government."

Yoshiko Uno, the 72-year-old mother of war criminal Gotaro Uno, said, "I know the crimes my son committed against the Chinese people. We are truly sorry to the Chinese people." She also expressed her hope to stay in China for three or four weeks so that she can meet her son, whom she has not seen for nineteen years, several more times.
