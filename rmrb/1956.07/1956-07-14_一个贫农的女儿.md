    A Poor Peasant's Daughter
    Lao Hong
    There was a young Communist Youth League member who often proudly boasted to those around her about her poor peasant background. One day, her father, a poor peasant in his sixties, suddenly came to the office looking for her. Her father's visit was for no other reason than that her mother and brothers were sick in bed. Besides already having overdrawn two sums of money from the cooperative, he wanted to borrow some from his own daughter, who had already become a state cadre, in order to get through this difficult time. But the daughter went out for more than ten minutes and then returned to the office as if nothing had happened. A comrade asked her:
    "Your father came such a long way, why didn't you let him rest for another day?"
    She answered without hesitation, and in an annoyed tone:
    "Let him stay? He came to ask me for money! Now everyone lives by their own labor, of course I can't cultivate his exploitative thinking."

    一个贫农的女儿
    劳洪
    有个年纪青青的女青年团员，经常眉飞色舞地向周围的同志们夸耀她贫农出身的成分。有一天，她那六十多岁的贫农的父亲忽然到机关里来找她。她父亲这一来不为别的，是因为她母亲和兄弟都病倒在床上，除了已向合作社借支了两笔钱，还想向这位已成为国家干部的亲生女儿也借一点，以便渡过目前这一段困难日子。可是女儿出去了十多分钟，便若无其事地回到办公室里来了。有个同志问她：
    “你父亲那么远赶来，怎么不留他多歇一天呀？”
    她毫不犹豫地、气咻咻地回答说：
    “还留他？他是来向我要钱的！现在谁都靠自己劳动过活，我当然不能培养他的剥削思想。”
