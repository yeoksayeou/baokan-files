Detailed Account of Poznan Events

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 30th -- The Polish News Agency reports: Serious disturbances occurred in Poznan on June 28th. The detailed circumstances of this event are as follows:

In the days leading up to the event, dissatisfaction existed among workers at the Stalin Factory in Poznan and some other factories regarding the delayed resolution of wage and employee demands. On June 27th, a special delegation of workers from the Stalin Factory returned to Poznan from Warsaw, bringing back a decision to satisfactorily resolve their basic demands. Simultaneously, the Polish Minister of Machine Manufacturing Industry and leaders of the Mechanical Workers' Union Executive Committee also arrived in Poznan. Despite these steps taken to meet the demands of the workers, incited by saboteurs, workers at the Stalin Factory stopped working on the morning of June 28th and went to the square in front of the Municipal People's Council Presidium building. The workers maintained a calm attitude, but organized groups of saboteurs mixed amongst them began to incite them to rise up against the people's government.

At that time, organized saboteurs ran in groups to various factories and institutions in Poznan, driving workers into the streets, and using threats against them from time to time. Workers at the power plant, waterworks, gas plant, general post office, and other important public utilities did not heed the incitement of the saboteurs, did not succumb to the pressure they used, and persisted in working throughout the entire disturbance. It is worth emphasizing the performance of the railway workers at Poznan station. Despite the provocations and conspiracies of the bandits, they persisted in working and tried to prevent the interruption of railway traffic.

The first wave of disturbances and conspiracies to forcibly storm public buildings began in the square in front of the Municipal People's Council. The Poznan Municipal People's Council and the headquarters of the Poznan Municipal Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party were attacked. At the same time, agitators, obviously guided by a pre-prepared plan, attacked the Military Prosecutor's Office, the prison, and the radio station in groups, and attempted to occupy the railway station, banks, and post office. Many workers tried their best to oppose and stop the saboteurs. The bandits broke into the prison, releasing criminals who also joined the disturbances.

The aim of the armed gangs was clearly to provoke bloodshed. They attacked the Public Security Bureau, shooting at it and throwing incendiary devices. The building was subjected to machine gun fire and grenade attacks in several places. During the prolonged conflict around the Public Security Bureau, the Public Security Bureau staff carried out heroic self-defense, with deaths and injuries on both sides.

Groups of armed saboteurs simultaneously overturned trams and cars, attempting to erect barricades. However, this action did not receive the support of the masses.

In order to quell the riots and restore public order in the city, military units and tanks were brought in, but they obeyed orders and did not open fire.

Due to the special circumstances, the authorities implemented a curfew from 9:00 PM to 4:00 AM the next morning. All residents of the city obeyed this decision and returned home on time. In various parts of the city, groups of armed individuals continued to attempt to provoke shooting incidents and loot shops. But these people were quickly cleared out.

Thanks to the heroic and selfless actions of soldiers, police, and public security personnel, the situation in the city is under control.

On the morning of June 29th, most workers returned to work. Individual saboteurs were being hunted down throughout the day.

With the assistance of conscious workers and staff, the Party and trade union organizations finally restored normal work in all factories and institutions in the city.

According to the materials of June 29th, a total of thirty-eight people died and two hundred and seventy were injured as a result of the provocations.

    波兹南事件详细经过
    新华社华沙30日电　波兰通讯社讯：波兹南市在六月二十八日发生了严重骚动。这个事件的经过的详细情况如下：
    在事件发生的前几天，波兹南斯大林工厂和其他一些工厂的工人对工资和职工提出的要求迟迟不予解决的情况存在着不满。六月二十七日，斯大林工厂工人组成的一个特别代表团从华沙返回波兹南，带回了关于圆满解决他们的基本要求的决定。同时，波兰机器制造工业部长和机械工人工会执行委员会领导人也抵达了波兹南。尽管采取了这些满足职工要求的步骤，斯大林工厂的工人在破坏分子的煽动下，在六月二十八日上午停止了工作，前往市人民会议主席团大厦前面的广场。工人们保持镇静态度，但是混在一起的已经组织起来的成批破坏分子开始煽动他们起来反对人民政权。
    那时有组织的破坏分子成群地跑到波兹南各工厂和机关去，带动工人到大街上去，对他们不时使用威胁。电力厂、自来水工厂、煤气工厂、邮政总局和其他重要公用事业机构的工人没有听从破坏分子的煽动，没有屈服于他们所使用的压力，在整个骚动期间坚持工作。值得着重指出的是波兹南车站铁路工人的表现。匪徒们进行挑拨阴谋，他们还是坚持工作，设法防止铁路交通的中断。
    要以武力冲进公共建筑物的第一阵骚动和阴谋是在市人民会议前面的广场上开始的。波兹南市人民会议和波兰统一工人党波兹南市委员会总部受到袭击。同时，显然在事先准备的计划指导下的挑拨分子成群地袭击军事检察署、监狱、广播电台，并且企图占领车站、银行和邮局。许多工人尽力反对和制止破坏分子。匪徒冲进了监狱，把罪犯释放，罪犯们也参加了骚动。
    武装匪帮的目的显然是要挑起流血事件，他们进攻公安局，向公安局开枪，投掷纵火物。大楼受到好几处地方的机关枪扫射和手榴弹的袭击。在公安局四周发生长时间冲突的时候，公安局工作人员进行了英勇的自卫，双方互有死伤。
    成批的武装破坏分子同时推倒电车和汽车，企图树立障碍物。但是这个行动并没有得到群众的支持。
    为了扑灭暴动，恢复市内治安，调来了军事部队和坦克，不过它们遵照命令，没有开火。
    由于特殊状况，当局实施了从晚上九时到次晨四时的宵禁。全市居民都遵守这个决定，按时回家。在市内各处，成群的持有武器的人仍然企图挑起射击事件，并且抢劫店铺。但是这些人都被迅速肃清。
    由于士兵、民警、公安人员的英勇忘我行动，市内局势已在控制之下。
    六月二十九日上午，大多数工人都恢复工作。整天都有个别的破坏分子受到搜捕。
    党和工会组织在觉悟的工人和职员的协助下，终于在全市工厂和机关中恢复了正常的工作。
    据六月二十九日的材料，由于挑衅事件共有三十八人死亡，二百七十人受伤。
