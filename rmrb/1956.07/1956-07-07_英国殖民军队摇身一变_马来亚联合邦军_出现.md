Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 3rd: According to American newspapers, on July 2nd, Malaya formally "established" the so-called Malayan Federation Army. This army is actually the original British colonial army, merely with a change of name. It is reported that the reason for changing the army's name is that the British authorities want to use this to cover up their participation in the war against the Malayan people's national liberation movement.

    英国殖民军队摇身一变
    “马来亚联合邦军”出现
    据新华社讯　塔斯社纽约三日讯：据美国报纸报道，七月二日马来亚正式“成立了”所谓马来亚联合邦军。这支军队实际上就是原来英国的殖民地军队，只是把名称改变一下罢了。据报载所以要改变军队名称，是因为英国当局想借此来掩饰它参与反对马来亚人民民族解放运动的战争。
