Opening Up Wuyi Mountain
　　Zhou Gang　Chen Yuanmou

    Between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, there is a Wuyi Mountain range, its peaks submerged in layers of clouds, tightly gripping the throat of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. For many years, the towering peaks and Wuyi rock tea have made Wuyi Mountain famous throughout the country. In 1928, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army ignited the flames of revolution in the Min-Gan revolutionary base area, adding infinite honor to the name of Wuyi Mountain. Today, the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway is about to extend southward through the Wuyi Mountain range, and the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, following the path taken by the Red Army, is writing another glorious page on Wuyi Mountain.

    In November 1954, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and a large number of civilian workers ascended Wuyi Mountain. With the strong support of the people of the whole country and the people of the old revolutionary base areas of Min-Gan, they braved the winter cold of the Wuyi Mountain area, hacking through thorns and working suspended in the deep mountains and dense forests, building barracks, constructing roads, and launching the arduous task of building railway tunnels to open up the Wuyi Mountain range. Wuyi Mountain was seething with activity.

    Among the peaks of Wuyi Mountain, Dahe Mountain stands towering. Here, a tunnel, the longest on the Yingtan-Xiamen line at 1,460 meters, was to be excavated. According to the general excavation progress of tunnels, it would take at least twenty months to open up Dahe Mountain.

    As soon as construction began, difficulties were presented to the Railway Corps. Grade eight to twenty solid rock made the tunnel progress crawl like a snail, advancing only a few tenths of a meter per day, far from meeting the quota of 2.5 meters.

    But difficulties can be overcome.

    Yin Shanglong, the sharp knife company commander in charge of the excavation of the southern entrance of the Dahe Mountain tunnel – a revolutionary fighter who had used artillery to kill and wound a large number of enemies during the Liberation War – every day, when he saw the news in the newspaper about the rapid progress of the country's socialist construction, he simply forgot all his fatigue and worked day and night. When his wife fell ill, he couldn't spare time to visit her, and when he himself fell ill with a high fever, he continued his selfless work. He also worked with the soldiers to develop a map of the placement of drill holes for dealing with various types of hard rock. These "tactical maps" filled his notebook and were posted all over the walls and windows of the dormitory. The progress of the project accelerated, increasing from over one meter per day to two meters, three meters, four meters, and setting a new record of 5.2 meters per day.

    A lively labor competition unfolded on the Wuyi Mountain construction site. Yin Shanglong's sharp knife company first received a challenge letter from the sharp knife company at the southern entrance of the Xiaohe Mountain tunnel, which faced Dahe Mountain from afar. On the third day, the company at the southern entrance of Xiaohe Mountain achieved a new record of 5.6 meters per day. But two days later, Yin Shanglong's company caught up with a new record of 7.4 meters per day. Then, the company at the southern entrance of Xiaohe Mountain surged forward with a record of 8.6 meters. At this time, the officers and soldiers of Yin Shanglong's company worked even harder, and they finally won the victory with a new record of 8.9 meters.

    In the guide tunnels, where rock dust filled the air and the air was thin, the pneumatic drill operators held the pneumatic drills with both hands, their chests braced against the drills, kneeling or bending over, and engaged in a tenacious struggle with the rocks. As the project progressed smoothly, new difficulties arose: water more than one meter deep poured into the tunnels, greatly affecting the progress of the project. But the brave pneumatic drill operators were not afraid of difficulties, and they fought tenaciously in the water. When a drill hole hit a spring, water shot out like a fountain. When explosives were loaded in, they were immediately washed out. The blasters used cement-covered paper to plug the spring water layer by layer. The excellent blaster Xu Dejun led the blasting team from one shot to ten thousand shots, with almost every shot successful.

    The rapid progress of the Dahe and Xiaohe Mountain tunnel projects encouraged the officers and soldiers fighting on the first pass of the Wuyi Mountain range – the Tie Niu Guan (Iron Ox Pass) tunnel construction site, and their engineering efficiency was also constantly improving. Tie Niu Guan was once an ancient strategic pass guarding the border, with a fort standing on the mountain col, dangerous cliffs and precipices, and a naturally formed terrain. Zhang Bingyan, the sharp knife company commander fighting on the north entrance construction site of this tunnel, when encountering stubborn rocks and the most difficult drilling conditions, spent the whole day in the tunnel, not only directing everyone's work intensely, but also personally operating the pneumatic drill. After the drill holes were completed, he and the blasters loaded the explosives together for blasting.

    After many days and nights of hard work, the Tie Niu Guan tunnel, with a total length of 543 meters, was finally opened two months ahead of schedule. The Xiaohe Mountain tunnel, with a total length of 835 meters, was also opened two and a half months ahead of schedule. Many smaller tunnels were also opened ahead of schedule. Victory encouraged the soldiers who were excavating the Dahe Mountain tunnel, and the Dahe Mountain tunnel was successfully completed 118 days ahead of schedule.

    Wuyi Mountain has been conquered. The rail-laying train, loaded with materials and rails, is traveling rapidly southward through the high mountains and deep valleys of Wuyi Mountain!

    打通武夷山
    周纲　陈远谋
    在江西和福建两省之间，有一座群峰淹没在一层层云雾里的武夷山脉，紧紧卡住鹰厦铁路的咽喉。多少年来，峥嵘的奇峰和武夷岩茶，使武夷山名扬全国。1928年，中国工农红军在闽赣根据地燃起了革命的火焰，又给武夷山这个名字添上了无限荣誉。今天，鹰厦铁路要穿过武夷山脉向南伸展，英勇的中国人民解放军，踏着红军走过的道路，又在武夷山上写下了光辉的一页。
    1954年11月，中国人民解放军铁道兵和广大民工登上了武夷山，他们在全国人民和闽赣老革命根据地人民的大力支援下，冒着武夷山区冬季的严寒，在深山密林里，斩荆披棘，悬空作业，盖起营房，筑起公路，展开修筑铁路隧道打通武夷山脉的艰巨劳动。武夷山上沸腾起来了。
    在武夷山群峰之中，大禾山巍然耸立着。在这里，要开凿一条长一千四百六十公尺的鹰厦线上最长的隧道。人们根据一般隧道的开挖进度计算，要打通大禾山，至少要二十个月。
    施工一开始，困难就在铁道兵面前摆下了。八至二十级坚石使隧道进度像蜗牛爬行，每天只能进零点几公尺，根本达不到定额二点五公尺的要求。
    但困难是可以战胜的。
    担任大禾山隧道南口一部开挖工程的尖刀连连长尹尚龙——这个曾经在解放战争中用大炮杀伤过大量敌人的革命战士，每天，当他从报纸上看到祖国社会主义建设突飞猛进的消息的时候，简直就忘记了一切劳累，不分白天黑夜地工作着。他的爱人病了，他顾不得去看望，他自己病了，身上发高烧，仍然继续着忘我的劳动。他还和士兵们在一起研究出对付各种坚石的炮眼位置图，这些“战术图”在他的笔记本上画满了，宿舍的墙上和窗上也贴满了。工程的进度加速了，每天由一公尺多提高到两公尺、三公尺、四公尺，并且首创了日进五点二公尺的新记录。
    武夷山工地上展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。尹尚龙的尖刀连首先接到了和大禾山遥遥相对的小禾山隧道南口的尖刀连的一封挑战书，第三天，小禾山南口的连队达到日进五点六公尺的新记录。但是两天以后，尹尚龙连队又以日进七点四公尺的新记录追上去。接着小禾山南口的连队又以八点六公尺的记录突上来。这时候，尹尚龙连队的官兵们更加劲了，他们最后终于以八点九公尺的新记录赢得了胜利。
    在石粉飞扬，空气稀薄的导峒里，风枪手们用双手把住风枪，胸膛顶住风枪，跪着或躬着身子，和岩石展开了顽强的搏斗。在工程顺利进展的时候，新的困难又产生了：峒子里涌出了一公尺多深的水，大大地影响着工程的进行。可是勇敢的风枪手们不畏艰难，他们在水里顽强地战斗着。炮眼打在泉眼上，水像喷泉似地直射出来，炸药装进去，立刻就被冲出来，爆破手们使用包水泥的纸，一层一层地塞住泉水。优秀的爆破手徐德俊带领着炸破组由一炮放到一万炮，几乎炮炮成功。
    大、小禾山隧道工程的快速进展，鼓舞着战斗在武夷山脉的第一道关口——铁牛关隧道工地上的官兵们，他们的工程效率也在不断提高。铁牛关曾是古代一个镇守边关的要隘，关寨矗立在山垇上，危崖削壁、形势天成。战斗在这座隧道北口工地上的尖刀连长张炳彦在碰到顽石、打眼最困难的情况下，整天钻在隧道里，不但紧张地指挥大家作业，还亲自打风枪。炮眼打好以后，他又和炮手们一块装上炸药爆破。
   经过许多日夜的辛勤劳动，全长543公尺的铁牛关隧道，终于首先提前两个月打通了。全长835公尺的小禾山隧道，接着也提前两个半月打通。许多小的隧道也纷纷提前打通了。胜利鼓舞着开凿大禾山隧道的战士们，大禾山隧道提前118天胜利地完成了任务。
    武夷山被征服了。满载着材料、钢轨的铺轨火车，穿过武夷山的高山深谷，在迅速地向南开进！
