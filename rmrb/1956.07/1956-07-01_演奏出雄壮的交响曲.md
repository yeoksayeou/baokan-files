With the transformation of the economic base of society, the cultural activities of the superstructure will inevitably undergo revolutionary changes or upsurges sooner or later.

In this era of transition between the old and the new, all ideologies will inevitably unfold a comprehensive struggle; it is necessary to criticize the old and build the new. There are struggles between the new and the old, and there are also struggles between the new and the new.

In the criticism of the old culture, there is discarding and sublimation. This forms a dialectical unity of "discarding the old and bringing forth the new," allowing the vital elements in the old heritage to develop more smoothly in the new era.

In the construction of the new culture, there are trials and competitions. There are various trials in all aspects, and therefore there are competitions between various aspects, and there are also various competitions within each aspect. This will inevitably form a situation of "a hundred schools of thought contend."

Here, "innovation" is not rejected. In order to better unfold the "hundred schools of thought contend," "innovation" should be welcomed. Anything with originality, when it first appears, is invariably new and different. As long as you have a social foundation and theoretical basis, your academic value will sooner or later be widely recognized. Temporary "difference" will turn into a relatively long-term "sameness." Conversely, even if you are self-evident during a historical period, as long as you lose your social foundation and theoretical basis, you will become a useless burden, an incomprehensible oddity.

At present, we are in a transitional period of building socialism, and we fully possess the historical conditions for "a hundred schools of thought contend." The Party and the government call on us to rapidly raise our backward science and culture to the advanced level of the world, encourage us to formulate a twelve-year long-term plan, and encourage us to realize "a hundred schools of thought contend" in academic research. This clearly grasps the current historical conditions and vigorously promotes the cultural revolution.

The purpose of our "hundred schools of thought contend" today is to ensure that a socialist society will be basically built in twelve years. Therefore, today's "hundred schools of thought contend" is a socialist competition in research work between various academic departments, and at the same time a socialist competition in research work within a certain academic department.

Today's "hundred schools of thought contend" is different from the rise of various schools of thought in the Warring States period in our country, which was the "hundred schools of thought contend" during the period of transition from slave society to feudal society; it is also different from the "Renaissance" in the early modern Europe, which was the "hundred schools of thought contend" during the period of transition from feudal society to capitalist society. Today's "hundred schools of thought contend" takes the construction of socialism, and further the construction of communism, as our motive. We want to organize our orchestra around this motive and play an unprecedented magnificent symphony. All kinds of instruments play together or in layers, but always according to a certain score. We want to "contend," not "mess around."

Therefore, learning Marxism-Leninism and absorbing advanced Soviet experience is still the focus of learning and work, and we should strengthen our willingness to learn. Otherwise, you will "play" off-key and "contend" without any success. In addition to focusing on learning, of course, we must also learn other things, learn the strengths of any country and any nation.

There is no contradiction between acting in accordance with the plan and realizing "a hundred schools of thought contend." Various orchestras compete while playing the same piece of music; they compete even more while playing different pieces of music.

We are not just "contending," but we want to "contend" well, contend in a way that can promote socialist construction. If there is a burst of random shouting or noise, others will have to cover their ears, or even ask you to leave the concert hall.

The "hundred schools of thought contend" in the past could only last for a certain historical period. After the rule of the new class was fixed, cultural activities often showed a phenomenon of stagnation.

Today's and future "hundred schools of thought contend" can be maintained forever as long as we continue to work hard. That is because our task is to eliminate classes and continuously improve the people's cultural and material living standards, so we can obtain true freedom and truly achieve "daily renewal, and again daily renewal."

"Contend," experts! Contend more, faster, and better, but also more economically. Talk less nonsense, do less formulaic, stiff and lengthy articles, which is also a kind of "saving."

    演奏出雄壮的交响曲
    郭沫若
    社会的经济基础有了变革，上层建筑的文化活动必然或早或迟地发生革命性的变革或高涨。
    在这新旧交替的时代，一切意识形态必然展开出全面的斗争；既要批判旧的，又要建设新的。新与旧之间有斗争，新与新之间也有斗争。
    对旧文化的批判中，有扬弃，有升华。这就形成为“推陈出新”的辩证的统一，使旧的遗产中有生机的成分在新的时代得到更顺畅的发育。
    在新文化的建设中，有尝试，有竞赛。在各个方面都有各种各样的尝试，因而在各个方面之间有竞赛，在每一个方面之内也有各种各样的竞赛。这就必然形成为“百家争鸣”的局面。
    在这里并不拒绝“标新立异”。为了使得“百家争鸣”更好地展开，倒应该欢迎“标新立异”。凡是具有独创性的东西，在开始出现的时候，未有不是新异的。只要你有社会基础，有理论根据，你的学术价值早迟会得到广泛的承认。一时性的“异”会转变为比较长远性的“同”。反过来，尽管你在一段历史时期内是天经地义，只要失掉了社会基础和理论根据，你就会成为无用的长物，不可理解的怪东西了。
    目前我们处在建设社会主义的过渡时期，正充分具备着“百家争鸣”的历史条件。党和政府号召我们迅速地把落后的科学文化提高到世界的先进水平，既勉励我们制订十二年远景规划，又鼓舞我们在学术研究中要实现“百家争鸣”。这正明确地掌握了目前的历史条件，对于文化革命加以有力的促进。
    我们今天要“百家争鸣”，目的是要保证在十二年内基本上建成社会主义社会。因而在今天的“百家争鸣”，那就是在各个学术部门之间的研究工作的社会主义竞赛，同时也就是在某一学术部门之内的研究工作的社会主义竞赛。
    今天的“百家争鸣”，既不同于我国战国时代的诸子蜂起，那是由奴隶社会转变为封建社会时期的“百家争鸣”；也不同于欧洲近代初期的“文艺复兴”，那是由封建社会转变为资本主义社会时期的“百家争鸣”。今天的“百家争鸣”是以建设社会主义，更进而建设共产主义作为我们的母题（Motive），我们是要围绕着这个母题来组织我们的管弦乐队，演奏出史无前例的雄壮的交响曲。万种乐器齐奏或叠奏，但总要按照着一定的乐谱。我们要“争鸣”，而不是要“乱鸣”。
    因而学习马克思列宁主义、吸收苏联先进经验，依然是学习工作的重点，我们应该加强我们的学习的自愿。不然，你就会“鸣”得不落谱，“争”不出一个名堂。除重点学习之外，当然还要学习其它的东西，学习任何国家、任何民族的长处。
    既要按照规划办事，又要实现“百家争鸣”，这里也并没有矛盾。各种各样的管弦乐队，演奏同一的乐曲，其中就有竞赛；演奏不同的乐曲，其中更有竞赛。
    我们不是光“争鸣”，而是要“争鸣”得好，鸣得可以促进社会主义建设。如果一阵的乱叫或乱打响器，别人便只好蒙着耳朵，或甚至请你退出乐厅。
    过去时代的“百家争鸣”只能经历得一定的历史时期，待新的阶级统治一固定之后，文化活动便往往呈现出停滞的现象。
    今天和今后的“百家争鸣”，只要我们不断地努力，可以保持于永远。那是由于我们的任务是在消灭阶级，是在不断地提高人民文化生活和物质生活的水平，因而我们可以得到真正的自由，真实地做到“日日新，又日新”。
    “争鸣”吧，专家们！鸣得更多一些，更快一些，更好一些，但也要更省一些。废话少说，公式主义的硬梆梆的大块文章少做，那也就是一种的“省”。
