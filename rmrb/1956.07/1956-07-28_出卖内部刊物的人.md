    The Person Who Sells Internal Publications
    A comrade from Harbin wrote, saying that on July 6th, he discovered an internal publication published by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at a stall in Sanhan Street, Xiangfang District, Harbin. The cover of the publication was printed with the words "Internal Publication, Handle with Care," and the publication did contain confidential materials. After investigation, it became clear that the publication had been sold to the stall by a comrade from the Second Division of the Northeast First Engineering Company. The publication was marked with "Second Division Propaganda Committee." This company used to be located in the building near this stall. Not long ago, the company moved elsewhere, and a comrade took some books to sell to this stall. The stall owner bought this pile of books for three cents. The books that were sold along with this internal publication have already been used by the stall owner to wrap things. Whether there are any other internal documents among them is probably only known to the book owner himself. It is hard to imagine that this book owner packed his own clothes into boxes, but took the internal documents of the organization to the stall to sell. When he reached out to take those three cents, what was he thinking! If it was due to carelessness that the internal documents were mixed in with other unused books and sold together, then this book owner can also reflect on whether you were just as careless when you packed your own clothes and luggage.

    出卖内部刊物的人
    哈尔滨市的一位同志来信说，七月六日他在该市香坊区三韩街的一个摊贩那里发现了一本全国总工会出版的内部刊物。刊物的封面上还印着“内部刊物、注意保存”的字样，刊物中也确有有关机密的材料。经过查问，才弄清楚是这么回事：原来这本刊物是东北第一工程公司第二处的一个同志卖到这个摊子上的，刊物上还有“二处宣委”字样，这个公司原来设在这个摊贩附近的楼上。不久以前公司要往别处搬了，有一位同志拿了一些书籍向这个摊贩出卖，这个摊贩花了三毛钱就把这一堆书买下了。和这本内部刊物同时被卖的那些书籍已经被这个摊贩包东西用了，其中是否还有内部文件，大概只有书主人自己知道。使人很难想像的是，这位书主人把自己的衣物往箱笼里收拾，却把机关的内部文件拿到小摊上出卖，当伸手接那三毛钱时，他的心里究竟作何感想！如果说是由于马虎大意，把内部文件混在其他不用的书籍中一齐卖掉了，那么这位书主人也可以回想一下，你收拾自己的衣物行装是否也是同样如此马虎大意。
