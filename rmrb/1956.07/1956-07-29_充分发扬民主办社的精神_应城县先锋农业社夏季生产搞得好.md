Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 27th: The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengtan Township, Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, has greatly increased the enthusiasm of its members by developing the spirit of democratic cooperative management. Despite the hot weather, the cooperative has done well in harvesting early rice, rush-planting late rice, and fertilizing the fields. In the past twenty days, it has exceeded its original plan of accumulating 62,000 dan of fertilizer within one month. The rice paddies, covering more than 2,000 mu, have been weeded one more time than originally planned, and the plans for reclaiming mountains and converting dry land to paddy fields to expand the planting of late autumn crops have also been realized ahead of schedule.

A month ago, however, the production of the Xianfeng Cooperative was very poor. At that time, the cooperative launched a mass field inspection. The results showed that more than two-thirds of the rice fields had weak seedlings, many weeds, and a lack of fertilizer. Forty-four mu of cotton, sesame, and other crops were also growing poorly. It was estimated that about a quarter of the cooperative's annual grain production plan of more than two million jin would not be completed. The members were full of discussion and anxiety.

After learning about the situation, the Chinese Communist Party branch of the cooperative immediately conducted investigations and research among the members and found that the root cause was the serious bureaucratic style of the cooperative's cadres, who were divorced from the masses and from reality. This spring, when building the Hejia Weir, because the water source was small, the members were unwilling to build it. However, the cooperative committee regarded it as a "key" water conservancy project, using thousands of workers to build it, while the farmland water conservancy that should have been built was put aside. Now the weir lacks water, while other weirs have too much water to hold. In addition, due to not listening to the members' opinions, very few drainage ditches were dug in the fields. After heavy rains, the accumulated water could not be drained, drowning more than 110 mu of summer crops. Uneven fertilization alone resulted in a loss of more than 40,000 jin of grain.

After analyzing the above situation, the Party branch believed that the key to improving production was to fully develop democracy and quickly improve production leadership. At that time, everyone had many concerns. Some said, "The members' opinions are useless, and it's no use raising more." "We only have the obligation to produce, and we have no right to manage the cooperative's affairs." Some people were afraid of being attacked and dared not criticize the cadres. In response to this situation, the Party branch and the cooperative committee made self-criticisms to the members and announced the convening of a members' representative meeting, asking everyone to boldly criticize the leadership and put forward suggestions for improving production. At the same time, the cooperative committee also commended members Zhang Jiaolin and Chen Youfu for caring about the cooperative's affairs and boldly criticizing the leadership.

The members' representative meeting was held in late June. The representatives put forward a total of 138 criticisms and suggestions at the meeting, and conducted strict inspections of production and other work. After revising the production plan, everyone was not only confident in completing the plan, but also confident in overfulfilling the plan by increasing production by 360,000 jin of grain. At the representative meeting, the representatives also dismissed Wang Wenhua, the production team leader who had neglected his duties, and exposed his errors of engaging in favoritism and fraud, such as mixing wheat husks into the wheat pile and distributing it to the members.

### 充分发扬民主办社的精神  应城县先锋农业社夏季生产搞得好

    充分发扬民主办社的精神
    应城县先锋农业社夏季生产搞得好
    新华社武汉27日电　湖北省应城县城台乡先锋农业生产合作社发扬民主办社的精神后，大大地提高了社员的劳动热情。虽然天气很热，但是这个社收割早稻，抢插晚稻和田间的施肥工作都做得较好。近二十天，已经超额完成了原计划一月内积肥六万二千担的计划。两千多亩水稻田比原计划多薅了一次草，开荒山、改水田扩大晚秋作物种植的计划也提前实现了。
    一个月以前，先锋社的生产却很不景气。当时社里开展了一次群众性的田间检查，检查结果：三分之二以上的稻田禾苗不壮，草多肥缺，有四十四亩棉花、芝麻等作物也生长的不好。预计，全社全年二百多万斤的粮食生产计划约有四分之一完不成。社员们议论纷纷，思想不安。
    这个社的中共支部了解情况后，当即深入社员群众中调查研究，发觉病根子是社内干部有严重的脱离群众脱离实际的官僚主义的作风。今春修筑河家堰，因为水源小，社员不愿修，社委会却把它当成水利“重点”，动用几千人工来修，把该修的农田水利反而搁了起来。现在这个堰缺水，别的堰水多装不下。加上由于不听社员意见，田间开出的排水沟很少，大雨之后积水排不出，淹死一百一十多亩夏收作物以及施肥不均，仅此两项就损失粮食四万多斤。
    党支部分析了上述情况，认为搞好生产的关键是充分发扬民主，迅速改进生产领导。当时大家的顾虑很多。有的说：“社员意见不顶事，再提多些也是白费劲。”“我们只有生产的义务，哪有管理社务的权利。”有的人怕受打击，不敢批评社干。党支部和社委会针对这种情况，向社员进行了检讨，并宣布召开社员代表大会，要求大家大胆批评领导，提出改进生产的建议。与此同时，社委会还表扬了关心社务、大胆批评领导的社员张教林和陈尤福。
    六月下旬召开了社员代表大会。代表们在会上共提出了138条批评和建议，对生产和各项工作都进行了严格的检查。大家在修订生产计划以后，不仅有把握完成计划，而且有信心超额增产三十六万斤粮食。在代表会上，代表们还罢免了失职的生产队长王文华，揭露他徇私舞弊，曾把麦壳子掺在麦堆里分给社员的错误行为。
