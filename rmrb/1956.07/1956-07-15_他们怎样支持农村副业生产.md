This spring, the spring famine in Gujing District, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province was developing, and more and more farmers were taking out loans from the People's Bank. This situation made the Gujing District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party realize that leading farmers to develop sideline production to overcome the spring famine was a serious political task. From mid-April, the District Committee held several financial and economic meetings in succession to study how various financial and economic units could help agricultural cooperatives develop diversified operations and sideline production. Initially, financial and economic cadres generally believed that helping agricultural cooperatives develop diversified operations was not the main task of their departments, and therefore did not adopt a positive attitude of support. The District Committee helped them understand the important significance of developing sideline production for national construction, improving people's lives, and solving the spring famine. And from studying why industrial products were unsalable, and why the bank's living loans exceeded the planned target, they further realized the direct relationship between developing sideline production and the work of their departments. On the basis of raising awareness and unifying thinking, under the direct leadership of the District Committee, various financial and economic departments rapidly promoted farmers to develop sideline production.

The supply and marketing cooperatives have done a lot of work in actively opening up avenues for sideline production and sales. On the one hand, they went deep into the masses, held various forums, grasped the historical situation of sideline production and local products in the district, and understood sales channels and market prices; on the other hand, they sent cadres to contact various places and relevant departments, and actively looked for sales channels for products. In order to promote the sale of oyster shells, they sent people to investigate everywhere, and finally found an oyster shell lime processing plant in Zhuhai County that was shut down awaiting materials, completely solving the problem of oyster shell sales. In order to help the masses identify various local products and local medicines, the supply and marketing cooperative also held nine diversified operation exhibitions in the district's agricultural cooperative director training class and in various townships, exhibiting a total of 93 kinds of minerals, local medicines, local products, waste products, hair and bones, and hides that could be collected and harvested in various places. After seeing the exhibition, the masses said, "I didn't know these things were valuable before, but now I know, I must produce them." Many agricultural cooperative directors said, "In the past, many local medicines in the local medicine purchase list issued by the supply and marketing cooperative, I didn't know what they were. It turns out that the taro mountain grass that is all over the ground is Xiangfu. In the future, weeding can also be done while collecting medicine." In this way, at the district's agricultural cooperative director meeting, the District Committee put forward the issue of agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives "hooking up as three brothers." All 76 agricultural cooperative directors who attended the meeting signed triangular contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. The supply and marketing cooperative is mainly responsible for purchasing and selling products, and supplying seeds, fertilizers, and tools. And through the method of prepaying deposits, it helps agricultural cooperatives solve funding difficulties. The credit cooperative mainly helps to solve cost accounting, set up income and expenditure plans, and arrange funds. And under the principle of "supporting sideline production with sideline production," it provides appropriate loans to help. The tax office also answered the questions raised by various cooperatives regarding taxes on sideline production, dispelling concerns. At this meeting, the relationship between agricultural cooperatives and various financial and economic departments reached an unprecedented level of unity. Some agricultural cooperative directors said, "This should have been done a long time ago."

Due to the unified leadership of the Party Committee, and the coordinated role of various financial and economic units, sideline production in Gujing District has been vigorously developed. By May 15, the district's sideline income had reached 66,321 yuan. They plan to achieve a total sideline income of 1,119,200 yuan for the year, with an average income of 74.6 yuan per household.

    他们怎样支持农村副业生产
    光赞
    今年春初，广东省新会县古井区的春荒在发展着，农民向人民银行贷款的越来越多了。这种情况使中共古井区委会认识到领导农民开展副业生产渡过春荒是一件严重的政治任务。从四月中旬起，区委接连召开了几次财经会议，研究各财经单位如何帮助农业合作社开展多种经营和副业生产的问题。起初，财经干部们普遍认为帮助农业合作社开展多种经营不是本部门的主要工作，因而不采取积极支持的态度。区委便帮助他们认识开展副业生产对国家建设、改善群众生活和解决春荒的重要意义。并且从研究工业品为什么滞销，银行的生活贷款为什么突破了预定指标等问题中，使他们进一步认识开展副业生产和本部门工作的直接关系。在提高认识、统一思想的基础上，在区委的直接领导下，各财经部门迅速推动农民开展了副业生产。
    在积极打开副业生产的门路和销路上，供销合作社作了很多工作。他们一方面深入群众，召开各种座谈会，掌握本区副业生产和土产的历史情况，了解销路和市场价格；另一方面派干部到各地和有关部门联系，积极为产品找销路。为了推销?壳，他们派人到处调查，最后找到了珠海县一间停工待料的?灰加工厂，全部解决了?壳的销路问题。为了帮助群众辨认各种土产土药，供销社还在全区农业社主任训练班上和在各乡先后举办了九次多种经营展览会，展出了各地可以收采的矿产、土药、土产、废品、毛骨、皮类等共九十三种。群众看了展览会后都说：“以前不知道这些东西值钱，现在知道了，一定要生产。”很多农业社主任说：“过去供销社印发的土药收购表里的许多土药，不知是什么东西，原来满地都是的芋山草就是香付，以后中耕除草也可以顺便采药了。”这样，在区的农业社主任会上，区委便提出农业社、供销社和信用社“三兄弟挂上钩”的问题。到会的七十六个农业合作社主任都和供销社、信用社订立了三角合同。供销社主要负责收购和推销产品，供应种苗、肥料、工具。并且通过预付定金的办法帮助农业合作社解决资金困难。信用社主要帮助解决核算成本，定出收支计划，安排资金。并在“以副业养副业”的原则下，适当贷款帮助。税务所也就各社提出的关于副业生产的税收问题作了解答，解除了顾虑。在这次会议上，农业合作社和各财经部门的关系达到了前所未有的团结，有些农业社主任说：“早就该这样了。”
    由于在党委的统一领导下，发挥了各财经单位的配合作用，古井区的副业已经蓬勃地开展起来了，到五月十五日，全区副业收入已有66，321元，他们计划全年副业收入达到1，119，200元，平均每户收入74.6元。
