    Voices of the Masses
    Party Members Should Not Be Detached from the Masses
    Communist Party members should maintain close ties with the masses. However, I have found that the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau is an exception. Here, a difficult-to-cross chasm exists between Party members and the masses. For example, when several Party members are happily chatting together, if a non-Party member happens to walk by, it's as if a bird enters the forest, and all other birds fall silent. The non-Party member is often left in an awkward situation, not knowing whether to advance or retreat. I think this situation needs to be changed. (A Railway Bureau Employee)
    Improve Public Hygiene
    There is a bad phenomenon in our Jingdezhen. Every day, from morning to noon, farmers carrying buckets of night soil walk along the streets shouting to buy excrement. And citizens often pour the water used to rinse their chamber pots into the street. When the weather gets hot, the whole street smells awful, which is very unsanitary. I suggest that the relevant departments in Jingdezhen should pay attention to the management of night soil and improve public hygiene. (Wang Jian)
    Prevent Swimming Deaths
    Recently, there have been frequent reports of people drowning while swimming in Beijing. From late May to July 7th, it is said that thirty-three people have lost their precious lives as a result. Most of them are middle school students, primary school students, and young children under the age of eighteen. The incidents mostly occur in Haidian, Changping, and the Jingxi Mining Area. I hope that the relevant parties should find some ways to prevent these distressing events from continuing to occur.

    This Important Road Should Be Repaired
    The Dongguan Street in Tongzhou, Hebei Province, is an important transportation route for delivering coal from Tongzhou Station to various counties, and for transporting construction materials to nearby construction sites. However, this important road becomes a "mud pit" during the rainy season. Over the past few years, many vehicles have been damaged on this road, and some livestock have also been injured or killed. After the rainy season arrived this year, a mule has already broken its leg and a rubber-tired cart has broken its axle. However, the Tongzhou Municipal People's Committee seems to be turning a blind eye to this situation. I think this important road should be repaired.

    群众呼声
    党员不要脱离群众
    共产党员应当密切联系群众，可是，我发现北京市铁路分局却成了例外。这里，党员与群众之间隔着一条很难逾越的鸿沟：譬如有几个党员在一起正兴高采烈的谈笑，要是偶然走来一个非党群众，犹如一鸟入林，百鸟压声，常常弄得非党群众进退两难。我觉得这种情况有加以改变的必要。（铁路局一职工）
    改善公共卫生
    我们景德镇有一种不良现象，每天从清晨到中午，总有担着粪担的农民沿街叫喊收买粪便。而市民们也经常把涮便桶的水向街心倾倒，这样天气一热，满街臭气熏人，太不卫生。我建议景德镇的有关部门应该注意粪便管理工作，改善公共卫生。　（王　坚）
    防止游泳淹死人
    最近，北京市因游泳而淹死的人，时有所闻。从五月下旬到七月七日，据说已有三十三个人因而丧失了宝贵的生命。其中大部分是十八岁以下的中、小学生和幼儿，出事地点多在海淀、昌平和京西矿区。我希望有关方面应该想些办法，防止这种令人痛心的事继续发生。
                      （夏　芸）
    应该修这条要道
    河北省通州市东关大街，是从通州车站往各县运送煤炭的交通要道，和向附近工地运送建筑材料的交通要道。但是，这条要道一到雨季就成了“泥塘”。几年来，在这条要道上损坏了不少的车辆，有些牲畜也因此而伤亡。今年雨季到来后，已有一头骡子在此折了腿，一辆胶轮车断了轴，可是，通州市人民委员会对这种情况仿佛熟视无睹，我觉得这条要道应该修修了。
                        （李印田）
