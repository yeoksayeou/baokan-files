    Happiness
    Xu Kailu

    I wandered around Beijing's Dong'an Market for an afternoon, without feeling tired. What kept me there wasn't the winding roads, but the ingenious handicrafts. The magnificent cloisonné brought me peace; the simple and elegant inlaid lacquerware made me feel sincere and honest; as for the exquisitely carved ivory and the delicate glass products, they were equally irresistible, making me happy and reluctant to leave.

    But then a feeling suddenly made me feel young again, as if I were a dream-seeker from a fairy tale who had entered the land of dreams. After traversing the world, I realized that truth was right beside me; I said I had found happiness. Isn't this a blueprint for life? Look, when I unfolded it, I found the youth of people, the youth of the times:

    In this market, although there are many pedestrians and countless customers, everyone yields to each other and greets each other with smiles, their peaceful and leisurely expressions making one linger. You are planning to buy that small cloisonné vase to take home, aren't you? You are preparing to add a small ornament to your desk. And me? I am here to buy a beautiful brooch for my wife.

    A pedestrian passed by, then another, and I ran into a friend I hadn't seen for a long time.

    "Ah!—"

    A cry of joy, and then we shook hands.

    What would he buy? This Shanghai municipal industrial model worker, who had recently come to Beijing for a meeting, what ideas would he have?

    We went into a shop. Golden and dazzling clocks, covered with shiny glass domes; large porcelain vases with colorful patterns, sitting on bright red velvet cushions. Everything dazzled us.

    "I'll buy this one!" my friend exclaimed.

    And so a delicate inlaid lacquerware box fell into his hands: the box was carved with a pair of pitiful and charming ancient court ladies, and inlaid with many gorgeous and moving patterns.

    Everything seemed so natural. This beautiful inlaid lacquerware box had found its owner. What would it do for him? I asked this question, but then felt it was superfluous; his answer matched my guess: he would put his five medals in the box when he went home.

    Suddenly a shadow flashed through my mind, and another world appeared in my memory:

    It was in Shanghai before liberation, also in such an evening, people were rushing to buy goods in a large department store in order to avoid starvation. The crowded people all looked nervous and tired. Whether they bought a thermos or a towel, everyone shouted, yelled, and pushed, just to get rid of the money in their hands.

    When I arrived at this department store, I only felt my slowness and sluggishness. More than a hundred glass counters had long been emptied, with only a small pile of white, bare plaster statues of Chiang Kai-shek left in a corner, unwanted.

    It was on such an occasion that I met my friend. He held a stack of banknotes, looking at the empty glass counters, nervous, tired, and disappointed.

    Many people may no longer remember these distant past events. The younger generation, even younger than us, cannot even imagine that people once lived such a life. But, dear comrades, when we leisurely stroll in Dong'an Market today, watching people peacefully and carefully selecting decorations for their lives, can you blame my reluctance to leave?

    Now we are walking in another corner of this market, and we see a bespectacled scholar burying his head in piles of books. Perhaps he has been lingering here all day, perhaps he came early to look for some classic ancient books or some rare and fine editions? He probably even missed lunch, but he doesn't regret it. Look at him, picking and choosing one book after another—it's not hard for us to imagine that he obviously feels that he is in a treasure mountain.

    Let us all bless that we can arrange it to be even more prosperous and glorious.

    幸福
    徐开垒
    一下午，我徘徊在北京东安市场，也不觉得疲倦。使我忘返的，不是迂回曲折的道路，而是各种巧夺天工的手工艺品。瑰丽的景泰蓝，叫人宁静；古朴的嵌罗甸，又使人敦厚；至于精雕细镂的象牙，娇小玲珑的玻璃品，也同样叫人爱不释手，乐而忘归。
    可是还有一种感觉，忽然使我变得年轻，犹如童话中的寻梦人走入了理想之国，天涯海角的跋涉，一回首真理却原来就在身边；我说我找到了幸福。难道这不是一卷生活的蓝图吗？你看，我一展开它，便找到了人的青春，时代的青春：
    在这个市场里，虽然行人如织，顾客如云，而一个个沿道相让，笑脸向迎，那种安详悠然的神情，管叫人低徊不已。你正在打算把那个景泰蓝的小插瓶买回家去吧？你正准备在你的书桌上添置一具小摆设。而我呢？我却在这里为我的妻子选购一枚美丽的别针。
    一个行人过去了，又是一个过去了，我碰到一个久别重逢的朋友。
    “啊！——”
    一声欢呼，于是我们握手。
    他该买些什么呢？这个新近到北京来开会的上海市工业劳动模范，他会有一些什么想头呢？
    我们走进一间铺子里。金色辉煌的钟，套着光洁如镜的玻璃罩；彩文斑烂的大瓷瓶，座着鲜红丝绒的座垫。一切都使我们眼花撩乱。
    “我买这一个！”我的朋友叫起来。
    于是一只精致的嵌罗甸的盒子，落在他的手里：盒上镂着一对楚楚怜人的古仕女，还镶着不少瑰丽动人的花纹。
    一切都显得十分自然。这个美丽的嵌罗甸的盒子，找到了他的主人。它将为他做些什么呢？这个问题我提出了又觉得十分多余；他的答复是这样符合我的猜想：他回家去要把自己五枚奖章放在盒里。
    忽然一个影子在我的脑海里掠过，在我的记忆里出现了另一个世界：
    那是在解放前的上海，也是在这样的一个黄昏里，人们正在为着免除饥饿，在一家大百货公司抢购物资。拥挤的人群，个个显着紧张和疲劳，不论买到一只热水瓶也好，买到一条毛巾也好，大家叫着、嚷着、推着，只要能把自己手上的钱脱手。
    当我赶到这个百货公司，我只有感到自己的迟钝和缓慢。一百多只玻璃柜台早已变得空空，只有一小撮白色的光秃秃的蒋介石石膏像留在一个角落里，没有人要。
    就在这样的场合里，我遇见我那个朋友。他拿着一叠钞票，望着空的玻璃柜，紧张、疲劳，而又失望。
    关于这些遥远的往事，许多人也许已无复记忆。比我们更年轻的一代，甚至已不能想像人们曾经有过这样的生活。但是，亲爱的同志呵，当我们今天悠然闲游在东安市场里，看着人们安详细心地选购生活点缀品的情景，你说你能责怪我的恋恋不忍遽离的神情么？
    现在我们又走在这个市场的另一个角落里了，我们看见一个戴眼镜的读书人，把头钻在书堆里。也许他已经在这里逗留了一整天，也许他一早就跑来寻觅什么经典古籍或者什么金石善本吧？他恐怕连午饭的时间也错过了，但他并不懊悔，看他，一本又一本地选购着，——我们不难想像，他显然是感觉着他已在宝山之中了。
    祝福我们每个人都能把它安排得更其富裕和光采吧。
