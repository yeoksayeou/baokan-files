Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: According to a Polish Press Agency report, Nowak, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and First Deputy Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, delivered a report on the 12th anniversary of Poland's liberation at the Warsaw celebration meeting on July 21st.

Nowak first talked about the changes in People's Poland after its liberation from bourgeois and landlord rule. He said that in the twelve years since the establishment of People's Poland, Poland's industrial production has increased fivefold compared to the pre-war period. The socialist construction and industrialization since the implementation of the Six-Year Plan have fundamentally changed the face of Poland. Today, nearly seven million people work in the national economy sector, approximately three times the pre-war number. Huge industrial enterprises such as the Lenin Iron and Steel Works have been established.

Today, the basic part of the wealth of the country is the socialist property of all the people. Our rule is the rule of the people and is for the benefit of the working people.

He said that in the years from 1950 to 1953, due to increased international tensions, rapidly increasing our country's defense potential had become an extremely urgent issue, and a large part of industry had to be shifted to the defense aspect. Obviously, these tasks were a considerable burden on the entire national economy, and they inevitably had some negative impact on the improvement of living standards.

It was difficult to completely avoid many mistakes in our country's first long-term plan. Knowing our mistakes can help us better implement the new Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party has conducted a sharp and critical analysis of the premises and implementation of the Six-Year Plan.

In the Six-Year Plan, we had planned to greatly improve the living standards of the working people. Unfortunately, this was the most laborious thing – this task was not fully completed. When analyzing the results of the implementation of the Six-Year Plan, we must first find out the reasons why we failed to improve living standards according to plan. The main task of the Party and the government is to find ways to eliminate the root causes of these difficulties.

Nowak then pointed out the backwardness of agricultural development, the excessive centralization of national economic planning, the overly large state organs, and bureaucracy in guiding methods. He said that we still lack sufficient democratic supervision of the government by the working masses. Bureaucracy creates a sluggishness to the complaints of the working people. The Poznan events are a powerful proof of this point.

The Central Committee, at its Seventh Plenary Session, formulated a specific plan aimed at overcoming the current economic difficulties. And it emphasized that improving the living standards of residents is the main task of the Five-Year Plan.

The country's economic situation does not yet allow us to stipulate the amount of wages that we and all the people hope to achieve. Only by increasing the output of industry and agriculture can we more quickly meet the needs of the people. Let all the creative forces and patriotic forces of our country use all their energy, talent, and labor to increase our national income, to create a better, happier, and culturally increasingly improved life for every worker.

Nowak said that the preconditions and guarantees for the implementation of the Five-Year Plan are the further and full democratization of political and social life, enabling the broadest strata of the country to truly participate in managing the country and building the socialist system.

The greater the counterattack against those hostile elements who attempt to use the freedom of criticism to attack socialism and people's power, the greater the effectiveness of the development of the democratization process. It is also necessary to patiently and resolutely overcome the deviations among some supporters of democratization, who, regardless of their intentions, often unconsciously adopt a bourgeois liberal attitude towards democratization.

The Central Committee, at its recent plenary session, prepared some measures aimed at further developing socialist democracy in Poland. The Party will support any efforts and proactive actions in this regard. Expanding workers' democracy in factories is a key issue.

It is important that the enthusiasm and initiative of the working class and all working people should be raised, and their sense of responsibility for the entire economy and the country should also be raised at the same time, and their awareness of this point should also be raised: the improvement of living standards depends on themselves, depends on the development of production, depends on the improvement of quality, and depends on the improvement of the economic situation of each factory.

Nowak finally talked about the international situation. He said that today, we are celebrating National Day in a better international situation than ever before. International tensions have eased considerably. The Polish government, faithful to the policy of peaceful coexistence, will spare no effort to establish and develop comprehensive cooperation with all countries with different systems on the basis of respect for sovereignty and non-interference.

    诺瓦克在波兰国庆庆祝大会上发言
    动员广大人民建设社会主义
    据新华社华沙22日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员、波兰部长会议第一副主席诺瓦克七月二十一日在华沙庆祝大会上作了关于波兰解放十二周年的报告。
    诺瓦克首先谈到人民波兰从资产阶级和地主统治下获得解放后的变化。他说，在人民波兰成立后的十二年期间，波兰工业生产已经增加到战前时期的五倍。执行六年计划以来的社会主义建设和工业化，已经根本改变了波兰的面貌。现在，将近有七百万人在国民经济部门
  中工作，约相当于战前的三倍。像列宁冶金联合企业这样巨大的工业企业建立起来了。
    今天，国家的财富的基本的部分是全体人民的社会主义财产。我们的统治是人民的统治，并且是为了劳动人民的利益办事的。
    他说，在从1950年到1953年这几年中，由于国际紧张局势加剧，迅速增加我们国家的防御潜力已经成了一个极为迫切的问题，必须把很大一部分工业转向防御方面。显然，这些任务是整个国民经济的一个相当重的负担，它们不能不对生活水平的提高起了一些不好的影响。
    在我国的第一个长期计划中，要完全避免许多错误是困难的。我们能够知道我们错误就能帮助我们更好地执行新五年计划。所以，波兰统一工人党中央委员会已经对六年计划的前提和执行情况作一次尖锐的和批判性的分析。
    我们在六年计划中曾经计划大大提高劳动人民群众的生活水准。不幸，这是最费力不过的事情——这个任务没有全部完成。在分析六年计划执行的结果的时候，我们首先要找出使我们未能按照计划提高生活水准的原因。党和政府的主要任务是设法消除这些困难的根源。
    诺瓦克接着指出了农业发展的落后、国民经济计划工作的过于集中、国家机构过于庞大以及指导方法方面的官僚主义。他说，我们仍然缺少劳动群众对政府的充分民主监督。官僚主义造成对劳动人民的抱怨的迟钝感。波兹南事件就是这一点的有力证明。
    中央委员会在第七次全体会议上制定了一项旨在克服目前经济困难的具体计划。并且强调指出，改善居民生活水准是五年计划的主要任务。
    国家的经济情况还不允许我们规定出我们和全体人民都希望达到的工资数目。只有增加工业和农业的产量，才能更加迅速地满足人民的需要。让我国的一切创造力量和爱国力量把他们的全部精力、才能和劳动用来增加我们的国民收入，用来创造每一个劳动者的更美好的、更幸福的和文化日益提高的生活。
    诺瓦克说，实行五年计划的先决条件和保证是政治和社会生活的进一步的和充分的民主化，使国家最广泛的阶层真正参加管理国家和建设社会主义制度。
    对那些企图利用批评自由来攻击社会主义和人民权力的敌对分子的反击愈大，那末，民主化过程的发展的成效愈大。还需要耐心地和坚决地克服某些民主化拥护者中间的偏差，这些人，不论他们的意图怎样，常常不自主地对民主化采取资产阶级自由主义的态度。
    中央委员会在最近的全体会议上准备了一些目的在于在波兰进一步发展社会主义民主。党将支持这方面的任何努力和主动行动。在工厂内扩大工人民主是一个关键问题。
    重要的是，工人阶级和所有劳动人民的积极性和主动性应该提高，他们对于整个经济和国家的责任感也应该同时提高，还应该提高他们对于这一点的认识：生活水平的提高决定于他们自己、决定于生产的发展、决定于质量的改进和每一个工厂的经济情况的改进。
    诺瓦克最后谈到了国际形势。他说，今天，我们是在比以前任何时候都要好的国际形势下庆祝国庆的。国际紧张局势有了相当的缓和。忠实于和平共处政策的波兰政府将不遗余力地在尊重主权和互不干涉的基础上，同所有不同制度的国家建立和发展全面的合作。
