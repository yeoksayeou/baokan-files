Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: The long-debated amount of US foreign aid appropriations for the 1957 fiscal year has reached a consensus in yesterday's joint conference of both houses of Congress. The new bill passed jointly by both houses is a compromise bill, which is more than 340 million US dollars more than the House of Representatives voted for, and more than 340 million US dollars less than the Senate voted for.

The figure stipulated in the new bill is 3,766,657,000 US dollars. It is more than 1 billion US dollars less than the figure Eisenhower requested from Congress at the beginning of this year.

An important change in this new appropriation bill is the prohibition of using the 1957 fiscal year appropriations for military aid to Yugoslavia.

During the discussion of this bill, the US Congress was embroiled in a dispute between two opinions. One was that, in view of the growing neutralist sentiment in many regions of the world, the method of tightening control over US aid should be used to maintain the relationship between these regions and the United States. The other was that foreign aid should be continued, and US dollars should continue to be used to win over other countries.

In the debate over whether to continue aid to Yugoslavia, there was also a fierce dispute between two factions. Senators Knowland, Bridges, and McCarthy advocated a complete cessation of aid to Yugoslavia as a "punishment" for Yugoslavia's reconciliation with the Soviet Union, while others expressed concern that doing so would further "alienate" Yugoslavia from the United States.

Knowland's proposal to completely cease aid to Yugoslavia was rejected because it did not obtain the necessary majority. The content of the new bill is: military aid shall not be given to Yugoslavia from the appropriations of the 1957 fiscal year; military materials that have been allocated and are already awaiting shipment are an exception.

    美国会对援外问题争吵激烈
    两院联席会议通过折衷拨款法案
    本年度停止对南斯拉夫进行军事援助
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：吵嚷了很久的美国1957财政年度对外援助拨款数目，已经在昨天国会两院联席会议上取得了一致意见。两院联合通过的新法案是一个折衷法案，它比众议院表决的增加了三亿四千多万美元，比参议院表决的减少了三亿四千多万美元。
    新法案规定的数字是三十七亿六千六百五十七万美元。它比艾森豪威尔今年年初向国会要求的数字减少了十亿多美元。
    这个新拨款法案的一个重要改变是禁止用1957财政年度的拨款对南斯拉夫进行军事援助。
    美国国会在讨论这个法案过程中发生了两种意见的争吵。一种是，鉴于世界许多地区中立主义情绪的增长，主张用加紧控制美援的办法来保持这些地区同美国的关系，另外一种是主张继续援外，继续用美元来笼络其他国家。
    在讨论过程中发生的关于是否继续援助南斯拉夫的问题上，也发生了两派意见的激烈争吵。参议员诺兰、布里奇斯和麦卡锡等主张全面停止对南斯拉夫的援助，作为对南斯拉夫同苏联修好的“惩罚”，而另外一部分人表示担心这样做会使南斯拉夫进一步“疏远”美国。
    诺兰的全面停止对南斯拉夫援助的提案因为没有获得必要多数而遭到否决。新法案的内容是：不得在1957财政年度的拨款中给南斯拉夫以军事援助，在这以前拨出的、已经待运的军用物资则是例外。
