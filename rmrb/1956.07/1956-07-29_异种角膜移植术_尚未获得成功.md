    "Xenograft Corneal Transplantation" Has Not Yet Been Successful
    The "xenograft corneal transplantation" research of Xu Yan'an and Tang Jidao, two ophthalmologists at the Liuzhou People's Hospital, has not yet been successful. The corneas of ten blind eyes transplanted with monkey corneas, after a period of transparency, have now all become cloudy. From October 1954 to October of last year, they performed animal corneal transplants on the ten eyes of ten patients with corneal diseases. After transplantation, the corneas of eight eyes were transparent or translucent. The patient whose vision recovered best was Mo Shaocheng, whose vision in one eye improved from only being able to see fingers at a distance of one foot to 0.2 (normal human vision is 1.0). However, to date, all the transplanted and transparent corneas have become cloudy after varying periods. The cornea of Lu Zhigao had the longest transparent period, lasting sixty-eight days.
    The reporter inquired from these two researchers about whether the clouding phenomenon resulting from xenograft corneal transplantation was accidental.
    Xu Yan'an said: "From these failed cases, Tang Jidao and I believe that the clouding phenomenon of the two corneas cannot be confused. Because the basic substance that constitutes corneal cells in humans and monkeys—the nature of proteins—is not completely the same. When we tried to transplant monkey corneas directly without human serum culture, they immediately became cloudy; while after serum culture, the grafts could be transparent for a period. Therefore, we tentatively explain the failure of this medical technique as: the cell performance of the modified monkey cornea is not stable enough and cannot permanently coordinate with human eyeball cells, resulting in antagonistic effects and causing corneal clouding."
    According to Tang Jidao, there is currently no way to remedy this clouding phenomenon.
    When talking about the experience and lessons learned in this research, Xu Yan'an said: "Although some patients can still undergo homologous corneal transplantation in the future, the lesson we have learned is that clinical trials should be considered more thoroughly and carefully."
    Tang Jidao said: "We still have gains in failure. First, we believe that xenograft corneal transplantation has research value. Second, we have initially explored the path for future research on this medical technique: we should find out the most basic differences between monkey and human corneal cells and see if we can find a way to eliminate these differences." Xu Yan'an then added: "The next step of research is more complex and detailed, involving advanced scientific research in biochemistry. This cannot be easily solved by clinical trials. Therefore, we hope that more scientists can help us!"
    The physicians expressed that they will continue to carry out this research in order to gain more experience.

### “异种角膜移植术”尚未获得成功

    “异种角膜移植术”尚未获得成功
    柳州市人民医院两个眼科医师研究徐延安和唐继道的“异种角膜移植术”还没有获得成功，用猴子角膜移植的十只盲人眼睛的角膜，一度透明以后，现在已经全部混浊。从1954年10月开始，到去年10月止。他们替十个有角膜疾患的病人的十只眼睛，作了畜种角膜移植。移植后，有八只眼睛的角膜是透明和半透明的。其中视力恢复得最好的是莫绍成，他的一只眼睛由原先只能在一尺距离内看出手指数的视力，进到0.2（人的正常视力是1.0）。但到现在为止，所有经过移植而透明的角膜，在经过不同时期后，都已混浊。其中以陆志高的角膜透明期最长，有六十八天。
    记者向这两位研究者了解了异种角膜移植所产生的混浊现象，是不是偶然的。
    徐延安说：“从这些失败的病例中，我和唐继道认为两种角膜的混浊现象不能混为一谈。因为人和猴子构成角膜细胞的基本物质——蛋白质的性质，不完全相同。我们试把猴子角膜不经过人的血清培养直接移植后，立即混浊；而经过血清培养后，移植片却能透明一个时期。因此，我们把这个医术的失败原因，初步解释为：改造后的猴子角膜的细胞性能，不够稳固，同人的眼球细胞不能永久协调，以致发生拮抗作用，造成角膜混浊。
    据唐继道谈，这种混浊现象，目前还没有挽救的办法。
    在谈到在这次研究中的心得和教训时，徐延安说：“虽然，有些病人以后还能重做同种角膜移植术。但我们已得的教训是：做临床试验还应考虑得更周密慎重。”
    唐继道说：“我们在失败中，还是有收获的。首先，我们认为异种角膜移植术有研究价值。其次，我们初步探索了今后研究这项医术的路径：应找出猴子同人的角膜细胞最基本的不同点，看看能否设法使这不同点消除。”徐延安又接着说：“下一步的研究工作是更复杂细致的，要牵涉到生物化学的高级的科学研究。这不是靠临床试验所能轻易解决的。因此，希望更多的科学家能来帮助我们！”
    医师们表示将继续进行这项研究，以便取得更多的经验。
