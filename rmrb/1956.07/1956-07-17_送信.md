    Delivering a Message
    Zhao Ciming
    At night, the wind howled, and the sky was as dark as the bottom of a pot. The instructor's house was still lit, and he was pacing back and forth, holding an urgent telegram he had just received. After careful consideration, he wrote a letter, took his flashlight, and went to the house where the Third Squad lived, waking up Yu Dahe.
      "Comrade Yu Dahe, we just received an urgent telegram stating that special agents are planning to sneak across the border tomorrow. I'm sending you to deliver this letter to a certain check point overnight, alerting the comrades there to be extra vigilant. Completing this task will be difficult. You'll have to climb the famous Forty Li Slope, cross the swift, unnamed river, and do it all at night. You must be extremely careful and deliver the letter by eight o'clock tomorrow morning. It concerns the security of the motherland!"
      "Report, Instructor! A soldier is loyal to the motherland. I will deliver the letter on time!"
      "Good! I wish you success! Start preparing now, and find a comrade to go with you. You are designated as the leader of the team."
    At 10:10 PM, Yu Dahe and Wang Zhijian set off. In the pitch-black sky, one could not see one's own fingers. Two horses galloped across the boundless desert.
    "Comrade Wang Zhijian, when socialism is built, this place will probably be full of canals and villages, and electric lights will be installed!"
      "Yes, Squad Leader." "We can also set up canning factories, leather factories,..." Yu Dahe and Wang Zhijian walked and talked, and finally arrived at the famous Forty Li Slope. This slope became increasingly steep, and in some places, the road was very narrow, with bottomless cliffs and rapids below. A moment of carelessness could send people and horses sliding and falling. They carefully led their horses, slowly climbing upwards. The air became thinner and thinner, and they found it difficult to breathe. Wang Zhijian vomited a mouthful of clear water with a "wah" sound, his body softened, and he almost fell. Yu Dahe quickly helped him up and took out a packet of army pills from his pocket to give him. After Wang Zhijian took the pills, he felt a little better, and they finally climbed to the top of the mountain.
    As the sky began to brighten, they arrived at the rushing, unnamed river. It was on this river that Second Class Merit recipient Xiong Shaowen had been swept 400 meters downstream by the rapids. When he floated ashore, he was covered in wounds, and his horse had been knocked down and drowned. Xiong Shaowen walked back to the barracks alone, barefoot, his legs swollen like rising dough.
    Yu Dahe thought, first, I am a squad leader, a Communist Party member, and second, Wang Zhijian doesn't know how to swim very well, so I have to go into the water first to find a way across. He hid the letter, wrapped in five layers of oiled paper, slung his rifle over his back, straddled his horse, and jumped in at a place where the current seemed gentler. The water became deeper and deeper. Suddenly, his horse lost its footing, and a rapid wave rolled in, knocking him off the horse's back. The horse rolled a few times and leaped to the opposite bank, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't float to the other side. The raging waves seemed to want to sweep him away. "No! I can't let the flood wash me away. I must arrive by eight o'clock tomorrow morning. It concerns the security of the motherland!" He vaguely saw a black object in front of him and swam towards it with all his might. He reached out and grabbed it; it was a large rock on the shore. He struggled upwards, climbed onto the rock, his vision went black, and he fainted on the stone slab.
    After about a quarter of an hour, he gradually woke up, slowly propped himself up with both hands, and felt his pocket. The "letter" was still in his pocket. He took it out and saw that it was not wet. The rifle on his back was also still there. Only he was barefoot, his trousers were gone, and his head and legs were injured, with blood flowing out. "It doesn't matter, as long as I complete the task!" But one thing made him worried: "I wonder what happened to Wang Zhijian?"
    Just then, Wang Zhijian ran over, soaking wet!
    "Squad Leader, Squad Leader! I was so worried!"
    It turned out that after Wang Zhijian saw the squad leader being swept away by the water, he quickly rode his horse into the water to save him, but who knew that he was also swept away. However, he held on tightly to the horse's reins, and the horse brought him to the other side. Now, looking at the squad leader in this state, he hurriedly took out a towel and bandaged his head.
    The bright red sun had already risen from the east, and the two warhorses were galloping again. They sang loudly: "Even if we suffer a little, it will make the new motherland strong and secure..." They arrived at a certain check point, and the clock had not yet struck eight.

    送信
    赵慈命
    夜里，狂风呼啸着，天黑得像锅底一样。指导员的房子里还点着灯，他手里拿着刚才接到的一封紧急电报，在房子里徘徊着。他考虑成熟后，写了封信就带着手电筒走到第三班住的房子里，叫醒了余大和。
      “余大和同志，刚才接到一封紧急电报，说是明天有特务要偷越国境，我派你连夜把信送到某卡，要那里的同志特别警惕。完成这个任务是困难的，要爬过那有名的四十里大坂，还要涉过那湍急的无名河，又是在夜里，你要特别谨慎小心，明早八点钟一定要把信送到，它关系着祖国的安全！”
      “报告指导员！战士忠于祖国，我一定把信按时送到！”
      “好！祝你成功！你现在就开始准备，再找一个同志和你同去，指定你是组长。”
    夜里十点十分的时候，余大和同王志坚一起出发了。漆黑的天，伸手看不见五指，两匹马驰骋在漫无边际的大沙漠上。
    “王志坚同志，等到社会主义建成的时候，这里可能到处是水渠和村庄，还要安上电灯呢！”
      “是呀！组长。”“在这里还可以开办罐头工厂，皮革厂，……”余大和和王志坚走着说着，终于来到了那有名的四十里大坂。这座大坂，越上越陡，有的地方路很窄，下面是万丈悬岩和激流，一不小心，人马就有被滑倒摔下去的危险。他们小心地牵着马，慢慢往上爬。空气越来越稀薄，他们感到呼吸困难。王志坚“哇”的一声吐出一口清水，身子一软，几乎摔倒。余大和连忙把他扶住，从衣袋里掏出一包行军丹给他。王志坚吃了行军丹以后，稍微好些了，他们终于爬到了山顶。
    在天蒙蒙发亮的时候，他们来到了激流滚滚的无名河。就是在这条河上，二等功臣熊少文曾经被激流冲下去四百公尺远，浮上岸来时，满身伤痕，马也被冲倒淹死了。熊少文一个人光着身子，赤脚走回了营房，腿肿得像发面一样。
    余大和想，一来我是个组长，共产党员，二来王志坚又不怎样懂水性，我得先下水寻路过去。他把包了五层油皮的信藏好，背着枪，跨上马，拣一个水势较缓的地方跳了下去。越走水越深，忽然马失前蹄，一个急浪滚来，把他从马背上打了下来。马打了几个滚，一跃冲到对岸，但他怎样用力也浮不到对岸，汹涌的巨浪，好像要把他卷走似的。“不！我不能让洪水把我冲走。明天八点钟一定要赶到，这是关系祖国安全的呀！”他模糊地看见前面有块黑东西，便猛力游去，伸手一抓，是岸边一块大石头。他使劲地往上一挣，爬上那块大石头，两眼一黑，就昏倒在石板上面了。
    大约有一刻钟光景，他渐渐地苏醒了，慢慢地撑着双手坐起，摸了摸口袋，“信”还在口袋里，拿出来看看并没有湿，背上的枪也还在。只是自己光着脚，穿的长裤也不见了，头部和两腿也撞伤了，鲜血直往外流，“不要紧，只要完成任务就行了！”但是有一件事使他放心不下：“王志坚不知怎样了？”
    正在这时候，王志坚湿漉漉地跑了过来！
    “组长，组长！可把我急坏了！”
    原来王志坚看到组长被水冲下去以后，连忙打着马进水里救他，谁知也被水冲下去了，但他死死地抓住马辔口，马把他带到了对岸。现在他望着组长这个样子，忙掏出毛巾，替他包扎好头部。
    鲜红的太阳已从东方升起，两匹战马又在奔驰，他们高唱着：“就是我们吃点苦，会使新生的祖国牢又牢……”到某卡，时针还没有指向八点。
