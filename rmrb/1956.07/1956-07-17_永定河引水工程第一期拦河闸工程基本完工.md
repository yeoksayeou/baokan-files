    First Phase of Yongding River Water Diversion Project's Barrage Basically Completed
    (Our Dispatch) On the riverbed of the Yongding River at Sanjiadian, the piers of the twelve-arch barrage stand tall, with floodwaters flowing torrentially under the raised floodgates. On the afternoon of July 14th, construction workers installed the last bridge beam of the newly built highway bridge on the barrage. By this point, the first phase of the Yongding River Water Diversion Project's barrage, including the twelve floodgates and the hoisting machinery for opening and closing the floodgates, as well as the simultaneously constructed highway bridge, has been basically completed before the flood season.
    The barrage is the headworks of the Yongding River Water Diversion Project. After closing the barrage gates, the river water can be blocked, raising the water level here, and the wide riverbed becomes a small reservoir, allowing the river water to flow into the diversion canal from the adjacent intake gate. The barrage has a total of seventeen arches, with a total length of more than 240 meters. Twelve arches were completed before the flood season, and the remaining five arches will continue to be constructed after the flood season. (Ma Yun) (Photo attached)

    永定河引水工程第一期拦河闸工程基本完工
    本报讯　在三家店永定河的河滩上，十二孔拦河闸闸墩矗立着，洪水从吊起的闸门下滚滚流去。七月十四日下午，起重工人安好了拦河闸上新建公路桥的最后一根桥梁。至此，永定河引水工程第一期拦河闸工程，包括十二孔闸门和启闭闸门的启闭机，以及同时修建的公路桥等已经在汛期前基本完工。
    拦河闸是永定河引水工程的渠首，把拦河闸闸门关闭后就可拦住河水，使这里水位升高，宽大的河床就变成一个小水库，让河水从旁边的进水闸流入引水渠道。拦河闸共有十七孔，全长二百四十多公尺，汛期前完成十二孔，其余五孔汛期后继续施工。（马耘）（附图片）
