    "You Must Come Again!"
    By Our Reporter Péi Dá

    On the 17th, the first group of over 30 members of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan, led by head of the delegation Mei Lanfang and first deputy head Ouyang Yuqian, bid farewell to Japan and returned to their motherland. On this day, the bright red Chinese flag fluttered at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, and the song "Tokyo-Beijing" rang out. The sun, which had been absent for several days, also showed its smiling face. Japanese friends from all walks of life and overseas Chinese who came to see them off were reluctant to part. They held the hands of the performers, expressing endless heartfelt words and reluctant feelings. Some were so moved that they shed tears. As the plane was about to take off, people were still shouting, "Goodbye, Mr. Mei!" "Goodbye, friends!" "You must come again!"

    During their performances in Japan, the Chinese Peking Opera artists, led by Mei Lanfang, attracted thousands upon thousands of people from beginning to end, every moment. At the time of their first performance in Tokyo, it was a crucial juncture in the Japanese Diet session. Diet member Ichiko Kamichika said, "The meeting is very important, but Peking Opera is a must-see. What to do? I put the meeting and the Peking Opera on the scales and weighed them, and as a result, I abandoned the meeting and watched the Peking Opera performance." Another member of parliament personally said to Mr. Mei Lanfang that one night he was watching Peking Opera when he suddenly heard that there was a fight in the Diet, so he took a car to take a look, and hurriedly returned to the theater. The second time he received an urgent call, he went to see again, and still rushed back to the theater to watch the play. The Japanese call this situation "Peking Opera Fever."

      "Peking Opera Fever" spread throughout the major cities in the southern half of Japan. Wherever there was a Peking Opera performance, there were crowds of people queuing up to buy tickets day and night. They were tireless, disregarding the hot weather, and even forgetting to eat. This "Peking Opera Fever" reached its peak when the Peking Opera troupe performed in Tokyo for the last time. Needless to say, tickets for seats were sold out within an hour. There were as many as 9,000 applications for standing tickets submitted in advance to the "Asahi Shimbun" newspaper, but there were only 1,000 standing tickets for five shows. There was no way but to draw lots. The famous Japanese writer Mushanokoji Saneatsu had been resting at home recently due to illness. He had already seen Peking Opera on television, but he was still not satisfied. Finally, he watched the closing performance for a whole night despite his illness. The wife of Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama watched the Peking Opera and said: "The stage colors of Peking Opera are bright and dazzling, and the performance is too beautiful. This is rarely seen in Japanese Kabuki."

    On July 6th, when the Peking Opera Delegation was returning to Tokyo from Hakone, we heard a very interesting conversation when we passed Mount Fuji. At that time, it was raining and Mount Fuji was submerged in dark clouds. All members of the delegation felt very regretful. A member of the delegation said with emotion, "Beautiful Mount Fuji! Why don't you come out to greet the Chinese guests?" While everyone was silent, the female attendant in the car answered the question. She said: "The beauty of Mount Fuji is world-famous. However, the guests who came today are too beautiful. She is also shy and hiding behind the clouds." This young girl's name is Miyoko Tsugida. When the Peking Opera Delegation gave its first performance, she rushed from Hakone to Tokyo to see the show. On this day, after she met the Peking Opera actors in Hakone, she always wanted to praise the Chinese artists, but could not find the right words. It was just when passing Mount Fuji that she found an opportunity to praise the Peking Opera actors.

    The novel and melodious singing, graceful dances, and magical martial arts of Chinese Peking Opera, even the actors' gestures and movements, aroused great interest among the Japanese audience. Some viewers asked: "How can your actors make voices that sound better than women singing? Why are your hands so beautiful? How did you learn your martial arts?" People who knew something about Peking Opera expressed their admiration for the superb acting skills of the Peking Opera actors. After watching it, critics and artists praised it endlessly in symposiums and articles. Poets were inspired after seeing it. Please see below a poem recited by poet Kiyoko Minato at the welcome meeting in Osaka:

    Tempered and refined, full of new spirit
    Performing arts permeated throughout
    Long years, heavy costumes
    Love and sweat cultivated unique skills
    How elegant, how bright
    Oriental sounds resound through the world

    After the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation concluded its performances, friends from all walks of life in Japan congratulated the success of the Peking Opera performances. Takejiro Otani, chairman of Shochiku Co., Ltd., who is over seventy years old, said: "I have been involved in theater for sixty years and have never seen any troupe have such a great success as you." Mosaburo Suzuki, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said that he was deeply moved by the important role played by the Peking Opera performance in Japan-China friendship. He expressed that he would strengthen political work to promote the further development of Japan-China friendship. On the evening of the 16th, the Peking Opera Delegation held a farewell cocktail party. During the banquet, the hosts and guests toasted for the friendship between the people of China and Japan. Professor Eishū Fujito of Waseda University couldn't help but sing. He first sang "The East is Red" softly, and then approached the Peking Opera actors and sang loudly in Chinese. The Peking Opera actors and Japanese friends responded with warm applause. He also said: "I am writing a history of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. The success of the Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan will be recorded in history." (17th)

### “你们一定要再来啊！”

    “你们一定要再来啊！”
    本报记者　裴达
    十七日，中国访日京剧代表团团长梅兰芳。第一副团长欧阳予倩等第一批三十多人告别了日本，回返祖国。这一天，东京羽田飞机场飘扬着鲜红的中国国旗，响起了“东京—北京”的歌声。好几天不见面的太阳也露出笑脸来。前往送行的日本各界友人和旅日侨胞们，一个个难舍难离。他们拉着演员们的手，说不完知心话，表不尽惜别之情。有些人激动得流下泪来。飞机要起飞了，人们还在喊：“梅先生再见啦！”“朋友们再见啦！”“你们一定要再来啊！”
    以梅兰芳为首的中国京剧艺术家在日本演出期间，从始至终，每时每刻都紧紧地吸引着成千成万的人们。在东京首次公演的时候，正是日本国会会议的紧要关头。国会议员神近市子说：“会议很重要，京剧不能不看。怎么办呢？我就把会议和京剧放在天秤上称了一下，结果放弃了会议，观赏了京剧演出。”另一位议员亲自对梅兰芳先生说，有一天晚上他正在看京剧，突然听说国会打起架来，于是坐着汽车去看了一下，赶忙又回到剧场。第二次接到紧急电话，他又去看了看，仍然赶回剧场来看戏。日本人管这种情形叫作“京剧热”。
      “京剧热”遍及了日本南半部的各大城市。哪里有京剧演出，哪里就有整天整夜排队买票的人群。他们不知疲倦，不顾炎热的天气，甚至忘记了吃饭。这种“京剧热”，到京剧团最后在东京演出时达到了最高峰。有坐位的票不用说，一小时之内就卖光了。只是预先向“朝日新闻”社申请订购站票的就有九千张，可是五场戏只有一千张的站票。没有办法，只好抽签。日本著名作家武者小路实笃最近在家养病，本来他已在电视里看到了京剧，但是还不过瘾，终于在闭幕演出时带病看了一个晚上。日本鸠山首相的夫人看了京剧以后说：“京剧的舞台色彩鲜艳夺目，演得太漂亮了。这在日本歌舞伎中是很少见的。”
    七月六日，京剧代表团从箱根返回东京途中，路过富士山前时，我们听到一段非常有趣的话。那时恰逢阴雨，富士山淹没在乌云之中。全团人员感到十分遗憾。一位团员望景生情地说：“美丽的富士山啊！你为什么不出来迎接中国的客人？”大家正在沉默的时候，汽车中的女服务员解答了这个问题。她说：“富士山的美丽是世界有名的。但是，今天来的客人太漂亮了，她也害羞了，躲在云彩的后边。”这位年轻的姑娘名叫尽代三惠子。在京剧代表团首次公演时，她曾从箱根赶到东京去看戏。这一天，她在箱根见到京剧演员后，总想把中国艺术家称赞一番，但是找不到适当的话。正好在路过富士山的时候，她找到了赞美京剧演员的机会。
    中国京剧的新颖悦耳的歌声，优美的舞蹈，神妙的武打，以至演员一举手，一投足，都使日本观众感到极大的兴趣。有的观众问道：“你们演员怎么能发出比女人唱歌还好听的声音？你们的手为什么那么美丽，你们的武艺是怎么学到的？”对京剧有所了解的人，都对京剧演员炉火纯青的演技表示钦佩。剧评家、艺术家们看了之后，在座谈会上，在文章里称赞不绝。诗人看了之后，诗兴大发。请看，下边就是诗人港野喜代子在大阪各界欢迎会上朗诵的一首赞美诗：
    千锤百炼、充满新精神
    表演艺术贯彻全身
    悠久岁月、沈重的戏衣
    爱和汗培育了绝艺
    多么高雅、多么鲜明啊
    东方之音响彻天地
    中国访日京剧代表团结束演出之后，日本各界友人纷纷庆贺京剧演出的成功。七十多岁的松竹公司董事长大谷竹次郎说：“我搞了六十年的戏，从未见过任何剧团有你们这样大的成功。”日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎说，京剧演出对日中友好所起的重大作用，使他深受感动。他表示要加强政治工作，推动日中友好的进一步发展。在十六日晚上，京剧代表团举行了辞行酒会。席间，宾主纷纷为中日两国人民的友谊而干杯。早稻田大学教授实藤惠秀情不自禁地唱起歌来。他先小声地唱着“东方红”，后来就走近京剧演员们，用中国语大声地唱起来。京剧演员和日本友人都报以热烈掌声。他还说：“我正在写中日文化交流史。京剧团来日本访问演出的成功，将被载入史册”。（十七日）
