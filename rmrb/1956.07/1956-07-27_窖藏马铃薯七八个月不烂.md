Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 25th. More than 1.2 million jin of potatoes stored in cellars at the State-owned Chaohu Farm in Gansu Province have remained entirely free of freezing or rotting after seven or eight months of storage.

The Chaohu Farm's experience in storing potatoes in cellars is as follows: First, the potato harvest period should not be too early. Based on the experience of various work stations over the years, the farm postponed the potato harvest period for the entire farm from late September to early October in 1955. At this time, the potato branches and leaves had completely turned yellow, and some had withered before harvesting. If harvested too early, the potatoes would have high moisture content and tender skins, making them susceptible to diseases and injuries. This is the biggest reason for freezing and rotting after storage. Potatoes with signs of disease and rot, as well as those that are not fully mature, must also be removed before storage. Second, the farm paid close attention to the dryness of the cellars they built. They started building the cellars in June and July when the weather was hot and easy to dry. Before storage, a 15 to 20 cm thick layer of dry sand was laid in the cellar, and the cellar was covered with firewood and straw, paying attention to ventilation. Third, the temperature inside the cellar must be maintained between two and four degrees Celsius during storage. When the temperature is low, the covering straw should be thickened and the ventilation holes reduced; when the temperature is high, ventilation should be increased, and the covering straw thinned or removed. Fourth, the farm also paid attention to assigning special personnel to inspection work during storage, checking every two or three days. Once rot is found, it should be immediately removed and separated.

### 窖藏马铃薯七八个月不烂

    窖藏马铃薯七八个月不烂
    新华社兰州25日电　甘肃省国营潮湖农场窖藏的一百二十多万斤马铃薯，已经窖藏了七、八个月，完全没有冻、烂的现象。
    潮湖农场窖藏马铃薯的经验是：第一，马铃薯收获期不宜早。这个农场根据各个作业站历年来的经验，1955年将全场的马铃薯收获期推迟自九月下旬到十月上旬，这时马铃薯的枝叶已全部变黄，有的已枯黄才收。如果收早了，薯内水分多，表皮脆嫩，易患病害和撞伤。这是窖藏后发生冻、烂的最大原因。储藏还须检去有病烂现象和未充分成熟的马铃薯。第二，这个场很注意所修窖的干燥工作。六、七月份即开始修窖。这时天气炎热，容易干燥。储藏前，还在窖内铺了十五到二十公分厚一层干砂，又用柴草盖窖，注意了通风的工作。第三，储藏期间，窖内温度须保持在摄氏二度到四度之间。低时加厚复草，缩小通风孔；高时加强通风，取薄或取掉复草。第四，窖藏期间这个场还注意专人检查工作，每隔两三天检查一次，一旦发现有腐烂时，立即检出分离堆置。
