    Support the Exploration Team
    Recently, we have received letters from some field geologists, requesting necessary supplies and equipment, necessary care for the lives of field workers, and special solutions to the special problems of geological work, so that they can better find the treasures buried underground in the motherland. Their requests are reasonable and should be resolved.
    The development of geological exploration work in our country (including exploration work in metallurgy, coal, petroleum, geology, and other departments) has been very rapid. The workload of the geology department alone in the past four years is more than what was done in the entire half-century before liberation. This year, the state has assigned them a drilling workload equivalent to the total of the past three years. The state's long-term construction also requires the geology department to provide a large amount of reserve resources, maintain the continuous increase of reserves, and continuously discover new mineral bases to meet the needs of the country's second five-year plan. Therefore, the current task of geological exploration workers is extremely urgent and arduous. If their tasks are not completed, the current and long-term industrial construction plans of our country will be difficult to realize.
    However, at present, the supply of materials and equipment for the geological exploration team is not adapted to the tasks they undertake. Many drilling rigs cannot be assembled into complete sets due to the lack of seamless steel pipes and drilling tools; many drilling rigs are damaged, and the progress of work is affected due to the lack of repair factories. In many areas where cars are needed, there are no necessary vehicles, and field personnel can only rely on walking long distances, which delays a lot of valuable time. There are also some geological exploration teams that go deep into deserts and mountains, and encounter very serious difficulties in their work and lives due to the lack of radio communication equipment.
    The supply of living materials for field geologists is also very lacking. Due to the scattered and mobile nature of field work and the limitations of transportation conditions, most prospecting teams and exploration teams far from cities cannot often eat vegetables, and some people cannot eat vegetables for years. The standards for the supply of grain and cooking oil in some areas are too low, so that their grain is sometimes not enough to eat; in the areas where several provinces meet, there is often no oil to eat. Commodity prices in some areas are too high. According to surveys of several geological exploration sites in East China, Northeast China, and Southwest China, the prices of commodities at the construction sites are 20%-120% higher than the prices of commodities in nearby areas. As for the staff working in high mountains and deserts, they not only cannot eat vegetables, but also often face the danger of running out of food and water. Cultural food is also very lacking. In some places, there is money but no books and newspapers to buy, and watching movies is also very difficult. Although the exploration team has small projectors, it is difficult to rent new films. With the expansion and development of geological work, the housing problem of field workers and their families is becoming more and more prominent. Except for the geological exploration teams in some industrial bases that have simple housing, most people live in tents, yurts, and some mobile houses. This kind of house certainly cannot solve the housing problem of the family members, and some employees with families have to rent private houses, stables, or live in caves. About 70% of the current employees of the Ministry of Geology and their families have been separated for a long time. Some employees' family members have complained, "Don't marry an exploration man, you'll be guarding an empty house all year round." These have to have many adverse effects on the work and morale of field geological workers.
  The Party and the state are constantly concerned about the geological exploration workers. In order to take care of the remote, high-mountain, and water-deficient conditions, the state gives geological exploration personnel certain field allowances, implements labor insurance, and most of the exploration teams are equipped with medical personnel. At the wage conference convened by the State Council, the wages of field geological workers have been ranked in the same position as mining enterprises. The Party and government organs and the broad masses of the people in various localities also try their best to take care of the geologists in the supply of living materials. All these are also unanimously recognized by the geological staff.
    Those who have seen the film "Treasure Hunt in the Deep Mountains" cannot but admire the geologists. From the Greater Khingan Mountains with year-round snow to Hainan Island with coconut trees, from the vast Junggar Basin and the Kangzang Plateau on the roof of the world to the coastline of the East China Sea stretching for thousands of miles, there are traces of geological exploration personnel everywhere. They have to go to places that no one or very few people have ever been to in history. To determine the reserves of each mineral, they have to go through countless explorations and researches, walk countless miles of rugged roads, and suffer countless attacks from wind, sand, heat, extreme cold, hail, rain and snow. The dispersion, mobility and arduousness of their work really require strong support from all sides. For example: temporarily build roads, supply necessary construction materials, so that the equipment of the exploration team can be transported to the work site; mobilize laborers to participate in the work of the exploration team; designate repair factories to help them repair mechanical parts; mobilize commercial departments to ensure the supply of non-staple foods; supply the exploration team with vehicles and communication equipment; help establish and enrich the medical institutions of the exploration team; mobilize film teams and art troupes to regularly screen and perform at the exploration site; and other many aspects of work cooperation. If all regions and departments include the various tasks of coordinating exploration work into their work agenda, then this will be a great gospel for field geological workers.
    In order to solve the special problems of field geological personnel in terms of living and welfare, the relevant leading departments, especially the geological department, must strengthen leadership, improve business management, and improve working conditions. Anything that needs to be solved and has the strength to solve it should be solved quickly. Establishing rear bases for geological exploration teams is a good way to solve some of the difficulties in the work and life of geological exploration workers. On this base, equipment and material warehouses can be set up, so that the materials necessary for exploration work can be supplied continuously. On this base, a number of employee residences can be established to house their families, so that they have a fixed foothold when they need to sort out materials at the end of each year's work. On this base, schools for employees' children can also be established, so that their children can enjoy the opportunity to receive education. In addition, it can also be considered to establish some service industries on this base that are suitable for the living habits of employees, so that they do not feel like guests in a foreign land when they live here. Such bases are urgently expected by field geological workers, and the geological department and relevant leading departments will surely accelerate the realization of this wish.

    支援勘探队
    最近，我们收到一些野外地质工作者的来信，他们要求给予必需的物资装备，要求对野外职工生活给予必要的关怀，要求按照地质工作的特殊问题给予特殊的解决，好让他们更好地寻找到埋藏在祖国地下的宝藏。他们的要求是合理的，应该得到解决。
    我国地质勘探工作（包括冶金、煤炭、石油、地质等部门的勘探工作）的发展是非常迅速的，仅仅地质部门在过去四年中的工作量，就比解放前整整半个世纪做的还要多。今年，国家交给他们的钻探工作量又相当于过去三年的总和。国家的长远建设还需要地质部门提供大量的后备资源，保持储量的持续上升，不断发现新的矿产基地，满足国家第二个五年计划所需的资料。所以，地质勘探工作人员当前的任务是极其紧迫而且繁重的。如果他们的任务完不成，我国当前的和长远的工业建设规划就难以实现。
    可是，在目前，地质勘探队伍的物资装备、材料供应的情况跟他们所担负的任务却不相适应。许多钻机因为缺乏无缝钢管和钻探工具而不能装配成套；许多钻机损坏以后，因为缺少修配工厂，影响了工作的开展。许多需要汽车的地区，却没有必需的车辆，野外人员只靠两条腿长途行走，耽误了许多宝贵时间。还有某些深入沙漠和高山的地质勘探队伍，由于没有无线电通讯设备，工作上和生活上都遇到了十分严重的困难。
    对野外地质工作者的生活资料的供应也很缺乏。由于野外工作分散流动和交通运输条件的限制，大多数的普查队和距离城市较远的勘探队不能经常吃到蔬菜，有的人成年也吃不到蔬菜。有的地区粮食、食油供应标准太低，以致他们的粮食有时不够吃；在几省交界的地方，还常常没有油吃。有的地区商品价格偏高，据华东、东北、西南几个地质勘探工地的调查，工地商品较附近地区商品的价格高出20％—120％。至于在高山和沙漠地带的工作人员，不仅吃不到蔬菜，而且常有断粮缺水的危险。文化食粮也很缺乏，有些地方有钱买不到书籍报刊，看电影同样很困难，勘探大队虽有小型放映机，但新片很难租到。随着地质工作的扩大和发展，野外职工及其家属的住宅问题愈来愈突出。除了部分工业基地的地质勘探队设有简易住宅以外，大部分人住的是帐篷、蒙古包和一些活动房子。这种房子当然不可能解决家属的住宅问题，部分带家眷的职工就不得不租赁民房、马棚或在山洞里居住。地质部现有职工跟家属长期两地分居的有70％左右，有的职工家属发出了“有女莫嫁勘探郎，一年到头守空房”的怨声。这些就使野外地质工作和工作人员的情绪不能不受到许多不利的影响。
  党和国家对于地质勘探工作人员是经常关心的，为了照顾边远、高山缺水等条件，国家给予地质勘探人员一定的野外津贴，实行劳动保险，绝大多数的勘探队配备了医务人员。在国务院召集的工资会议上又已把野外地质工作人员的工资顺序列为和采矿企业相同的地位。各地方的党、政机关和广大群众在生活资料的供应上也尽量给地质工作者以照顾，所有这些，也是地质工作人员所一致公认的。
    看过影片“深山探宝”的人，没有不钦佩地质工作者的。从长年积雪的大兴安岭，到椰子成林的海南岛，从辽阔无边的准噶尔盆地和世界屋脊的康藏高原，到绵延万里的东海海边，到处都有地质勘探人员的足迹，他们要去历史上从来没有人或者很少有人去过的地方。他们确定每一种矿物储量，不知要经过多少次的勘探研究，要走多少里的崎岖道路，要受多少次风沙、酷热、奇寒、冰雹、雨雪的侵袭，他们工作上的分散性、流动性和艰苦性，的确需要各方面给以大力的支援。例如：临时修建公路，供给必需的建设材料，让勘探队的装备能够运进工作地点；动员民工，参加勘探队工作；指定修配工厂，帮助他们修配机械零件；发动商业部门，保证副食品的供应；供给勘探队以汽车和通讯设备；帮助建立和充实勘探队的医疗机构；动员电影队、文工队经常到勘探工地放映和演出；还有其他许多方面的工作配合。如果各地区各部门把配合勘探工作的各项任务列入自己的工作日程，那末，这对野外地质工作人员将是极大的福音。
    为了解决野外地质人员生活福利方面的特殊问题，有关的领导部门，特别是地质部门必须加强领导，改善经营管理，改善劳动条件。凡是需要解决而本身有力量解决的问题，应该迅速解决。给地质勘探队建立后方基地，是解决地质勘探工作人员在工作和生活中若干困难问题的一个好办法。在这个基地上，可以设置器械装备和物资仓库，使勘探工作所必需的材料获得源源的供应。在这个基地上，可以建立一批职工住宅，安置他们的家属，使他们每年工作结束需要整理材料的时候，有个固定的落脚点。在这个基地上，还可以设立职工子弟学校，让他们的子弟得到享受教育的机会。此外，还可考虑在这个基地上设立一些适合职工生活习惯的服务行业，使他们生活在这里没有异乡作客之感。这样的基地是野外地质工作人员迫切期望的，地质部门和有关的领导部门想必会使这种愿望加速实现。
