Musings on Sketching in Hunan and Guangxi (Part 1)
    The Scenery of Guilin
    Hu Peihang
    Sun Yun’s “Random Jottings from My Brush” includes this passage: “Li Yanbo, a Xiucai from Guilin, said: A man from our village traveled almost everywhere in the country. After returning home, he said, ‘The Five Sacred Mountains are a joke after seeing them; even famous mountains yield to my hometown.’ His words are not an exaggeration.” Indeed, "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world," and this reputation is well-deserved!

    I arrived in Guilin at ten o'clock at night, and it was drizzling. The next day, as soon as it dawned, I walked out of the hotel and looked up. There was Elephant Trunk Hill, and there were Old Man Peak and Duxiu Peak... The mountains, bathed in sunlight, looked as if they were wearing new clothes, with a unique charm. After breakfast, I visited Diecai Mountain. The mountain is naturally formed from stacked green stones. There is a mountain pavilion on top. Looking east from the pavilion, one can see Yao Mountain and countless peaks. Because it had rained the night before, the morning peaks were surrounded by rosy clouds and emerald green hues, with golden light encircling them, simply breathtaking. I sketched some drafts, but I couldn't fully capture the scenery at the time. Even now, the beautiful postures of the peaks remain in my mind. Ancient paintings use gold paint to outline the contours of rocks, which is called gold and green landscape painting, but even that cannot fully express it. We Chinese painters should continue to study this. (Attached picture)

    湘桂写生随感之一
    桂林山水
    胡佩衡
    孙橒“余墨偶谈”有一段说：“桂林李燕伯孝廉云：其里人某，足迹半天下，还家后，有‘五岳归来成一笑，名山还让故乡多’之句。其言不为夸也。”的确，“桂林山水甲天下”，这话是名不虚传的！
    我到达桂林那天，晚上十点了，正落小雨。次日天刚亮，我走出旅馆，抬头一看，这边是象鼻山，那边是老人峰、独秀峰，……山上被太阳一照，如同穿了新衣服一样，别有风趣。早点后，游叠彩山，山是青石天然叠成，山上有一山亭，上亭向东望，就是尧山和无数的群峰。因为头天晚间落雨，所以早晨的群峰，云霞紫翠，金光环绕，令人叫绝。我钩了些画稿，但未能把当时景致完全描写出来。直到现在，我的脑中还留着群峰的美妙姿态。古画中用泥金钩山石轮廓，即所谓金碧山水，实在也未能完全表达，我们国画家应当继续研究。（附图片）
