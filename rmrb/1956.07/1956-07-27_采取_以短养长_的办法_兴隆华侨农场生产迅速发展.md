Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 25th -- The State-run Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island has achieved great success in developing tropical crops by adopting the method of "short-term to support long-term." Many visitors to the farm believe this is a good way to cultivate tropical crops.

Tropical crops such as coffee, pepper, sisal, rubber, oil palm, coconut, and cocoa are all long-term crops, taking several years to harvest. For example, rubber needs eight years after planting before it can be tapped. It is not easy to recover the farm's investment quickly. The Xinglong Farm adopted the method of "short-term to support long-term" and diversified operations, planting many short-term economic crops that yield quickly, such as citronella grass, patchouli, and lemongrass. Citronella grass, for example, can be harvested eight months after planting. Last year, the farm's income from citronella grass alone reached 350,000 yuan. This year's income from citronella grass and other crops is expected to reach about 1.1 million yuan.

Because these short-term crops require little investment, are easy to manage, have a fast turnover, and yield high returns, they have helped solve the farm's initial funding difficulties and support the large-scale planting of long-term economic crops such as coffee, pepper, sisal, rubber, oil palm, coconut, and cocoa.

The farm's director said: From the establishment of the farm at the end of 1952 to 1955, it received a total of 2.25 million yuan in allocations from the state, of which more than 300,000 yuan was used for natural disaster relief and welfare expenditures. However, because the farm adopted the "short-term to support long-term" diversified operation policy from the beginning, it not only solved many difficulties but also had the surplus capacity to continue reclaiming wasteland and planting long-term economic crops in large quantities according to national needs.

Currently, most of the nearly 16,000 mu of reclaimed wasteland has been planted with short-term economic crops. According to the farm's production plan, 40,000 mu of rubber and 20,000 mu of sisal will be gradually planted in all cultivated land.

### 采取“以短养长”的办法  兴隆华侨农场生产迅速发展

    采取“以短养长”的办法  
    兴隆华侨农场生产迅速发展
    新华社海口25日电　海南岛国营兴隆华侨农场采用“以短养长”办法经营热带作物取得了很大的成绩。许多参观这个农场的人都认为这是培植热带作物的好办法。
    热带作物咖啡、胡椒、剑麻、橡胶、油棕、椰子、可可等都是长期作物，几年才能收获。比如橡胶种植后需八年才能割胶。农场投资一时不易收回。兴隆农场便采用“以短养长”多种经营的办法，种植了许多香茅草、藿香、柠檬草等短期就有收成的经济作物。其中香茅草种植后八个月就可开始收割。去年，这个农场仅香茅草一项的收入达三十五万元。今年种植的香茅草等的收入，预计可达到一一零万元左右。
    由于这些短期即可收成的作物都是投资少、经营易、周转速、收效大，因此便于解决这个农场在创办初期资金不足的困难，还可支持农场大量种植像咖啡、胡椒、剑麻、橡胶、油棕、椰子、可可等。
    这个农场的场长说：农场在1952年底建场到1955年止的几年中，曾先后获得国家二二五万元的拨款，其中用于自然灾害的救济款和福利事业性的开支便达三十多万元。但是由于建场初期便采取“以短养长”多种经营方针，因此不但使农场解决了许多困难，而且还可有余力继续开垦荒地，按照国家需要大量种植长期经济作物。
    目前这个农场已开垦的近一万六千亩荒地中，大部分已种上短期经济作物，按照农场的生产规划，将逐步地在全部耕地中种植四万亩橡胶和二万亩剑麻。
