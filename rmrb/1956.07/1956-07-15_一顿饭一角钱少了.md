    A Dime Less for a Meal
    Currently, some cadres from urban government offices working in the countryside only pay a dime for a meal at farmers' homes, claiming it's a government regulation. According to farmers in Haicheng County, a dime definitely doesn't cover the cost of a regular meal. Therefore, I propose that this meal expense standard, if it is a government regulation, should be considered for adjustment. If it is not a government regulation, the cadres themselves should consciously pay the farmers enough for the meal. (Zhao Mingxing)

    一顿饭一角钱少了
    现在，有些城市的机关干部下乡工作，在农民家里吃一顿饭只付一角钱，并且说这是政府的规定。据海城县农民反映：一角钱确实不够一顿普通饭菜的成本。因此我提议这种饭费标准，如是政府规定，应该考虑调整。如不是政府规定，干部自己应该自觉地付给农民足够的饭费。　（赵明星）
