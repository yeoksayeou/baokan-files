    American Industrialist Ernest T. Weir on American Foreign Policy

Editor's Note: Ernest T. Weir is the chairman of National Steel Corporation (one of the top ten steel companies in the United States, belonging to the Midwest Consortium), a large American steel enterprise. He has close ties with the company's Executive Committee Chairman, the current Secretary of the Treasury, Humphrey. In recent years, Weir has continuously published articles advocating that the United States change its attitude towards the Soviet Union and China and adopt a realistic policy.

Recently, Weir delivered a speech entitled "The Road to Peace" at a gathering of the "Poor Richard Club" in Philadelphia. The American "National Vanguard" published excerpts from the speech on June 11th. Excerpts are translated and reprinted below:

For most of the time since World War II, the United States has given the impression that it is not a country that believes peace is possible, but a country that tends to believe that war is inevitable.

This impression is mainly due to America's unchanging attitude towards Russia and Communism, which is reflected in much of what we hear and read.

What they say can be summarized as: Russia is not a normal country, it is a conspiracy center that attempts to rule the world and communize it as soon as possible by all possible means. We cannot trust it, we cannot negotiate with it, nor can we deal with it. Only armed force is what it fears or respects.

Can we really expect Russia to reciprocate the "tough" policy we have adopted with a "soft" policy? Hostility is bound to generate hostility. Rude language is answered with equally rude language. If you were Russian, what would you think our armed forces, bases, and allies—along with our rhetoric—mean to you? Would you think they might be aimed at someone else? Would you be completely satisfied with our explanation that they are purely for defense? Wouldn't you have the idea that we might think that offense is the best defense at some point?

How will this hard-line policy affect our allies? They certainly won't agree, and it is very significant that no other country sees Russia as such a threat of war as the United States does.

What is the relationship between the hard-line policy and the non-aligned regions of the world? In this region, what people fear and hate is not communism, but colonialism. The non-aligned regions include countries that were recently colonies or are expecting to get rid of colonial status. In their eyes, the policies of the United States prolong the rule of colonialism, thus preventing them from achieving their highest goals.

The tone of the hard-line policy has been greatly reduced during and after the Geneva Summit in July. The agreement of the meeting stipulates that the differences between the two sides will be resolved through consultation and negotiation rather than war.

This is a major achievement. It provides important new opportunities to formulate policies that conform to the changed and changing world situation.

The conflict between East and West has narrowed to the basis of peaceful competition. Can we meet this challenge? I think it is definitely possible.

First, we should maintain military strength at the level required for national defense, we should maintain our alliances, and we should protect our internal security.

Second, we should make it a permanent policy to keep the door open for discussion and consultation on any issue with Russia and other communist countries. We should use calm and moderate language. We should encourage wider and more contact between the people of the West and communist countries by all means. At the same time, despite many objections, I still regard trade as one of these means, because I think its potential benefits outweigh any dangers it may cause.

Third, in all our relations with our allies, we should treat them as true partners, rather than simply as tools for implementing "American-made" policies.

Fourth, we must readjust our relationship with the uncommitted world, which may be our most sensitive area. The United States is not now and has never been a colonial country. But our main allies in Europe are colonial countries. And our actions to strengthen our allies for the common defense against communism appear to the uncommitted world as actions in support of colonialism. But the era of colonialism is over. The United States should play the role of helping colonial peoples achieve their goals.

Fifth, we should make an adjustment that may be most difficult for the American personality to accept. We must begin to think about foreign policy from the perspective of decades or even longer, rather than from the perspective of months or years, like Europeans, Russians, and Asians.

    ☆外国评论摘译☆   
    美国大工业家艾尔?斯特·魏尔谈美国外交政策
    编者按　艾尔?斯特·魏尔是美国大钢铁企业的联合组织国民钢铁公司（美国十大钢铁公司之一，属中西部财团。）的董事长，他和该公司的执行委员会主席、现任财政部长汉弗莱有密切关系。近年来魏尔不断发表文章，主张美国改变它对苏联和中国的态度，采取现实的政策。
    最近魏尔又在费城“可怜的理查德俱乐部”的集会上发表了题为“和平之路”的演说。六月十一日美国“国民前卫报”刊登了演说的节录，现摘译转载如下：
    在第二次世界大战以后的大部分时间中美国所给人的印象是它并不是一个相信和平是可能的国家，而是一个趋向于认为战争必然要发生的国家。
    这种印象的造成主要是由于美国对俄国和共产主义一成不变的态度，这种态度表现在许多我们所听到和读到的东西中。
    他们所说的总括起来就是：俄国不是一个正常的国家，它是企图以一切可能的办法、尽快地来统治世界并使它共产主义化的阴谋中心。我们不能信赖它，我们不能和它谈判，也不能和它打交道。只有武装力量才是它所惧怕或尊重的。
    我们真能期望俄国拿“软”的政策来还报我们所采取的“强硬”政策吗？敌意必定会产生敌意。粗暴的语言所得到的回答是同样粗暴的语言。假如你是俄国人，你认为我们的武装部队、基地、盟国——连带我们的言论——对你是意味着什么？你会认为它们可能是针对别的什么人的吗？你对我们把它们解释为纯粹是为了防御这一点会感到完全满意吗？难道你不会产生这种想法：我们可能在某一时候认为进攻才是最好的防御？
    这种强硬政策将会怎样影响我们的盟国呢？它们当然不会同意的，十分有意义的事情是没有一个别的国家像美国那样把俄国看作是战争的威胁。
    强硬政策和世界上未倒向任何一方的地区的关系又是怎样的呢？在这个地区中，人们所恐惧和憎恨的不是共产主义，而是殖民主义。未倒向任何一方的地区包括着不久以前仍然是殖民地的国家或者正期望摆脱殖民地地位的国家，在它们看来，美国的政策延长了殖民主义的统治，因而妨碍它们实现它们最高的目的。
    强硬政策的调子在七月日内瓦首脑会议期间及以后已大大地降低了。会议的协议规定双方的分歧将通过协商和谈判而不是用战争来解决。
    这是一个重大的成就。它提供了重要的、新的机会，以便制定符合于已经改变的、并且还在改变的世界形势的政策。
    东西方的冲突已经缩小到了和平竞争的基础之上。我们能应付这种挑战吗？我认为肯定是可以的。
    首先，我们应该把军事实力维持在国防所需要的水平上，我们应该保持我们的同盟，我们应该保护我们的内部安全。
    第二，我们应该使讨论和协商任何问题的大门永远向俄国和其他共产主义国家开着的政策成为我们永久性的政策。我们应该使用冷静和温和的语言。我们应该鼓励以一切手段来争取西方和共产主义国家的人民之间的更广泛和更多的接触。同时尽管有很多反对理由，我仍然把贸易作为这些手段之一，因为我认为它潜在的好处超过了它所产生的任何危险。
    第三，在对我们盟国的一切关系中，我们应该把它们当作真正的伙伴，而不是把它们只当作执行“美国制”政策的工具。
    第四，我们必须重新调整和未承担义务的世界的关系，可能这是我们的最敏感的地区。美国现在不是而且从来也不是一个殖民国家。但是我们在欧洲的主要盟国却是殖民国家。而我们为了加强盟国以共同防御共产主义而采取的行动在未承担义务的世界看来是支持殖民主义的行动。但是殖民主义的时代已经过去了。美国应扮演帮助殖民地人民达到他们的目标的角色。
    第五，我们应该进行对美国人的个性说来可能是最难接受的调整。我们必须像欧洲人、俄国人和亚洲人那样开始从几十年或更长的时期的角度而不是从几个月或几年的角度来考虑对外政策。
