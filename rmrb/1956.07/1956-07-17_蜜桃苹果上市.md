    Honey Peach Apples Are on the Market

    (Our newspaper reports) Big honey peaches and apples are beginning to appear on the market. The "June White" and "Parrot Beak" peaches from Yangfang Township in Changping District, and the honey peaches from the state-owned Western Suburbs Farm have been successively harvested; the early-ripening apples from the Western Suburbs Farm – "Huang Kui" and "Xiang Yan" – are also being launched on the market one after another.

    In the past, the honey peaches and grapes supplied to the Beijing market mostly came from state-owned farms and a few private orchards. This year, citizens will be able to eat the first harvest of honey peaches and grapes from suburban agricultural producers' cooperatives. The Yongcheng Cooperative, Yongding Cooperative, and others in the Jingxi Mining Area, which newly planted peach and grape trees in 1954, have begun to bear fruit this year, and the honey peaches from these cooperatives will soon be harvested and supplied to the market. In the future, as the number of fruit trees gradually increases and the trees grow older, large quantities of honey peaches, grapes, apples, and pears will, in the near future, be continuously supplied to the capital's people from the agricultural producers' cooperatives in the four suburbs.

    蜜桃苹果上市
    本报讯　大蜜桃、苹果开始上市了。昌平区羊坊乡的“六月白”、“鹦嘴子”和国营西郊农场的蜜桃都已陆续采收；西郊农场的早熟种苹果——“黄魁”、“香艳”也相继上市。
    北京市以往供应市场的大蜜桃和葡萄多半是来自国营农场和几家私人果园，今年市民们就要吃到郊区农业生产合作社第一次采收的大蜜桃和葡萄了。京西矿区永成社、永定社等在1954年新植的桃树和葡萄今年已开始挂果，这些社的大蜜桃即将采收供应市场。今后随着果树的逐渐增多和树龄的增长，大量的蜜桃、葡萄、苹果和洋梨，在不久的将来，即可以从四郊的农业生产合作社源源供应首都人民的需要。　　（杨力平）
