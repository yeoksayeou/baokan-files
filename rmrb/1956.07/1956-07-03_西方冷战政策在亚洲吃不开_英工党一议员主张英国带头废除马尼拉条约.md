Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from London: British Labour Party Member of Parliament Harold Davies, in a letter to the "Manchester Guardian," argued that the "Cold War" policy pursued by the West would only weaken their position in Asia. He said that Britain "should take the lead in abolishing" the Manila Treaty, stating that this treaty organization is "an irritant and should be replaced by an all-encompassing Pacific Charter including China, India and Japan."

    This letter was published in the "Letters to the Editor" section of the British "Manchester Guardian" on June 22nd.

    Davies said that the anti-colonialist forces formed by the Bandung Conference are "a new force in politics." "Three revolutions are combined in Asia: a revolution for self-determination, a revolution against hunger and poverty, and a spiritual revolution for racial dignity."

    He acknowledged that the purpose of British "construction" and "investment" in India, Burma and elsewhere "was to produce raw materials for Westerners."

    He said that the Western "Cold War" policy "tainted" the goal of Asian countries to develop their economies. Despite Western military and economic assistance, the Colombo Plan and the US Point Four Program, the economic situation in many Asian countries is deteriorating. According to the report of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, agricultural production in the Asian region (excluding China) is 14% lower per capita than in 1934-38. Although world exports increased by 6% between 1951 and the first half of 1955, exports from the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East region decreased by 21%.

    Davies concluded: "When the West insists on seeing the Pacific as a lake for its hydrogen bomb explosions, it cannot hope to win the hearts and souls of Asians." Westerners have "damaged the health of residents" on Pacific islands. "Tens of thousands of square miles of the high seas have become dangerous areas, unable to be navigated and where seafood cannot be obtained. No wonder Asians are dissatisfied with the 'free world.'"

    西方冷战政策在亚洲吃不开
    英工党一议员主张英国带头废除马尼拉条约
    新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯在给“曼彻斯特卫报”的信中认为，西方执行的“冷战”政策只会使它们在亚洲的地位削弱。他说，英国“应该带头废除”马尼拉条约，他说这个条约组织是“一种刺激品，应该代之以包括中国、印度和日本在内的包罗一切的太平洋宪章”。
    这封信刊载在六月二十二日英国“曼彻斯特卫报”的“致编者信”栏中。
    戴维斯说，万隆会议结成的反殖民主义力量是“政治中的一支新力量”。“三种革命在亚洲结合在一起：争取自决的革命、反对饥饿和贫困的革命以及争取种族尊严的精神革命。”
    他承认英国在印度、缅甸和其他地方的“建设”和“投资”的目的“都是为西方人生产原料”。
    他说，西方的“冷战”政策“玷污了”亚洲国家发展经济的目标。尽管有西方的军事援助和经济援助，科伦坡计划和美国第四点计划，亚洲许多国家的经济情况却在恶化。根据联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会的报告，亚洲地区（中国除外）农业生产量按人口计算比1934—38年还低14％。虽然世界出口在1951年到1955年头半年之间增加了6％，但是亚洲及远东经济委员会地区的出口却减少了21％。
    戴维斯最后写道：“当西方人坚持把太平洋看作他爆炸氢弹的湖泊的时候，他便不能希望赢得亚洲人的心和灵魂。”西方人使太平洋岛屿上“居民的健康受到损害。几万平方英里的公海成为危险地区，不能航行和取得海产品。难怪亚洲人对‘自由世界’不满了。”
