Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th Dispatch: The subgrade of the Baolan Railway has traversed high mountains and rivers, extending northwards from Lanzhou directly to Dijiatai. Over two hundred bridges and culverts on this section of the line have already been constructed, and thirteen high mountains blocking the railway's progress have been cleared with wide tunnels.

The Baolan Railway engineering department originally planned to lay tracks from Lanzhou to Dijiatai by the end of 1957. Based on the current situation, the track-laying work on this section can be completed in the third quarter of this year.

Currently, a large contingent of road construction workers are entering the new construction site north of Dijiatai. The road construction project on the section of over one hundred kilometers from Dijiatai to Baidunzi will soon be able to commence ahead of schedule.

    建好二百多座桥梁涵洞，打通十三座高山
    包兰铁路路基伸到狄家台
    新华社兰州8日电　包兰铁路的路基，已经穿过高山和河道，从兰州向北直伸到狄家台。这一段线路上的二百多座桥梁涵洞已经建筑好，挡住铁路前进的十三座高山，都已开辟出宽阔的隧道。
    包兰铁路工程部门原来计划到1957年年底，从兰州铺轨到狄家台，根据现在的情况看，这一段铺轨工程今年第三季就可以完成。
    目前，大队筑路工人正在进入狄家台以北的新工地，从狄家台到白墩子的一百多公里一段筑路工程，不久就可以提前动工。
