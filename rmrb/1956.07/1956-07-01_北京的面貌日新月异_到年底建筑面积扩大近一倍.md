    Beijing's Appearance Changes Rapidly
    Construction Area to Nearly Double by Year's End
    (Our Dispatch) In the past, standing on the White Pagoda in Beihai Park and looking down, one saw an endless green sea of trees. Now, looking again, one will find that above the green sea of trees, countless red and gray buildings have sprung up. By the end of 1955, Beijing had newly constructed approximately 14 million square meters of housing, equivalent to 70% of the housing area built in Beijing over the centuries before liberation. If we add the construction area planned for completion this year, it will be almost like building another Beijing. Moreover, a large portion of these buildings are high-rise buildings. According to statistics, in the newly built houses in 1955, 4-story and taller buildings accounted for 44.5%.
    Old Beijing was a consumer city, with only a few factories and some handicrafts exclusively for the enjoyment of the exploiting classes. This situation is also gradually changing. In the past six years or so, Beijing has newly built 1.25 million square meters of industrial buildings (excluding workers' dormitories). Take the eastern suburbs of Beijing, for example, where six years ago there were only a few factories destroyed by the Kuomintang, standing there isolated. Now, nearly thirty new factories stand one after another.
    Beijing has long been known as a "city of culture," but in the past, there were not many schools. The building area of higher education institutions in the past was only more than 210,000 square meters. Since liberation, more than 860,000 square meters have been newly built, equivalent to four times the past amount. Now, when people go to the northwest suburbs, they will see the "cultural and educational area" with more than 30 universities and colleges, as large as a city.
    In the past six years or so, the area of newly built cinemas and theaters has almost doubled compared to the past. These cinemas and theaters are mostly built in areas where the working people live.
    In recent years, Beijing has also newly built many office buildings for government agencies in whole blocks and streets. When people walk to the newly built, wide and flat You'anmen Street, Guangbai Road, Yuetan Street, Science Avenue... they will be attracted by the hundreds of magnificent four- and five-story buildings standing on both sides. The creative labor of the workers has rapidly changed the face of the capital. Even those who have lived in Beijing for a long time may get lost if they leave for two or three years and then return. In Hepingli, Sanlihe, Baiwanzhuang, and Liupukeng, countless buildings have replaced scattered villages. (Attached Picture)

### 北京的面貌日新月异  到年底建筑面积扩大近一倍

    北京的面貌日新月异
    到年底建筑面积扩大近一倍
    本报讯　过去站在北海的白塔往下望，看见的是一望无际的绿色的树海。现在再去看，人们就会发现在绿色的树海上面，竖起了无数红色的灰色的楼房。到1955年底北京已新建了约有一千四百多万平方公尺面积的房屋，等于解放前北京几百年建造起来的房屋面积的70％。如果加上今年计划完成的建筑面积，那就差不多等于又盖出来一个北京城。而且这些建筑一大部分是高层楼房。据统计1955年新建的房屋中四层和四层以上的占44.5％。
    旧的北京是一个消费城市，只有少数几个工厂和一些专供剥削阶级享乐的手工业。现在这种状况也逐步改变了。六年多来，北京新建工业用房（不包括工人宿舍）125万平方公尺。像北京的东郊，六年前只有很少的几个被国民党破坏了的工厂，孤零零地站在那边，现在近三十个新工厂一个接一个矗立起来。
    北京很早就被称为“文化城”，但过去的学校并不算多。像高等学校的房屋面积过去只有二十一万多平方公尺。解放后新建了八十六万多平方公尺，相当于过去的四倍，现在人们走到西北郊就会看到那一片拥有三十多所高等学校和专科学校像一个城市一样大小的“文教区”。
    六年多来新盖的影剧院面积比过去增加了将近一倍。这些影剧院多建造在劳动人民聚居的地区。
    这几年北京还成片成街地新建了许多机关办公大楼。当人们走到那新建的宽广平坦的右安门大街、广白路、月坛大街、科学大路……就会被那两旁耸立成百幢四层、五层宏伟的大楼吸引住。工人们创造性的劳动迅速地改变了首都的面貌，连那些曾经长期住在北京的人，要是离开两三年再回来有时也都要迷路。在和平里、三里河、百万庄、六铺坑数不尽的楼房代替了零散的村舍。（附图片）
