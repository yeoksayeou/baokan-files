Local Newspaper Commentary Summary

Meeting the New Requirements of the Rural Market

The July 5th editorial of the Shanxi Daily stated: In the recent period, the sales volume of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in Shanxi Province has seen new growth. Facts prove that organizing sufficient goods, expanding commodity supply, and rapidly decentralizing commodities are the central key to further invigorating the rural market.

The editorial said that after the realization of advanced cooperativization in rural areas, the demands of farmers for consumer goods have significantly expanded, both in quantity and the range of purchases. Commodities that were previously unimportant to farmers are now trending towards becoming indispensable in life. This situation was not so obvious when farmers lacked pocket money in the first quarter, and the problem was not so serious. However, when the Party and the People's Government took many effective measures to increase farmers' income, so that farmers not only had pocket money but also surplus money to improve their lives, coupled with this year's bumper wheat harvest, the situation of insufficient supply of some consumer goods in rural areas was exposed. Cadres of commercial departments should sufficiently recognize this new change in the rural market and adapt their work to this new situation.

The editorial pointed out that to meet this new demand in the rural market, it is necessary to actively organize the source of goods and expand the variety of commodities. The editorial criticized the tendency of some state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Shanxi Province to not actively seek out sources of goods, especially neglecting the organization of local sources of goods. The editorial said: Currently, there are not only a large number of local sources of goods that can be organized, but many facts also prove that some people's need for local sources of goods is no less than their demand for large industrial products. Therefore, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in Shanxi Province should start from the needs of the masses to actively seek out local sources of goods, and at the same time, pay attention to giving play to the business enthusiasm of joint venture commercial personnel and small vendors, and open up new sources of goods in many ways through their past purchasing relationships.

The editorial also pointed out that to further invigorate the rural market, it is also necessary to change the sales method of rigidly pairing goods, because this method of compulsory buying and selling, which is not based on the needs of the masses, can only spoil good things.

    地方报纸评论摘要
    满足农村市场的新要求
    山西日报七月五日的社论说：最近一个时期，山西省国营商业和合作社商业的销货额都有了新的增长，事实证明，组织充足的货源，扩大商品供应，并且把商品迅速下放，是进一步活跃农村市场的中心关键。
    社论说，农村实现高级合作化以后，农民对于消费品的要求，不论从数量上和购买范围上，都有了显著的扩大。过去有些对农民是无关要紧的商品，现在却有升格为生活当中不可缺少的趋向了。这种情况，在第一季度农民缺少零花钱的时候，还看得并不怎样明显，问题也并不严重。但当党和人民政府采取了许多有效措施，增加了农民收入，使得农民手头不但有了零花钱，而且有余钱来改善自己生活，再加上今年小麦丰收，农村中部分消费品不足的情况，便暴露出来了。商业部门的干部应该足够地认识到农村市场这种新变化，使自己的工作适应这一新情况。
    社论指出，要满足农村市场的这种新要求，就要积极组织货源，扩大商品品种的来源。社论对山西省某些国营商业部门和供销合作社的干部不积极主动寻找货源，特别是忽视组织地方货源的偏向进行了批判。社论说：当前不仅有大批的地方货源可以组织，而且很多事实证明，有些群众对地方货源的需要，并不下于对大工业产品的要求。因此，山西省国营商业和合作社商业应该从群众的需要出发，去积极地寻找地方货源，同时要注意发挥合营商业人员和小商贩的经营积极性，通过他们过去的进货关系，去多方面开辟新的货源。
    社论还指出，要使农村市场进一步活跃，还必须改变硬性搭配货物的销售办法，因为这种不根据群众需要强制买卖的办法，只能把好事做坏。
