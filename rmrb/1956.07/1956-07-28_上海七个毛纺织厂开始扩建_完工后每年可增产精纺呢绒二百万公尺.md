Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Gao Jie) reported: Seven woolen mills in Shanghai have recently begun their first expansion projects since liberation. After all these expansion projects are completed, annual production of worsted wool fabric can be increased by more than two million meters. The total investment for this expansion is two million yuan, which can be recovered from production profits and taxes paid to the state within about two months after production begins.

　　Among the seven factories being expanded, six are worsted woolen mills and one is a yarn factory. This expansion utilizes existing vacant factory buildings and more than 10,000 wool spindles that have been idle and unused for many years. Therefore, the expansion time only requires about three months to half a year, and the required investment is also small. The joint state-private Zhanghua Woolen Mill, famous for producing worsted fabrics, originally had a vacant factory building. After merging with the newly joint state-private Dagong, Zhenfeng and other woolen mills last year, it had surplus weaving machines and dyeing and finishing equipment. This time, it will install more than 2,600 idle and unused worsted spindles from the joint state-private Yinfeng Woolen Mill. With an investment of only about 300,000 yuan, it can produce more than 400,000 meters of worsted fabrics per year. The joint state-private Yumin Woolen Mill has relatively spacious factory buildings. By slightly adjusting the existing equipment without adding factory buildings, it can install 10,000 worsted spindles. The joint state-private Xinhua Lun, Yuanfeng, and Huafeng woolen mills, as well as the woolen section of the joint state-private Yuhua Cotton, Wool, and Linen Textile Factory, are also undergoing expansion at the same time. The 1,200 newly expanded worsted spindles of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Woolen Mill have already been put into production in early July.

　　After the Shanghai woolen textile industry implemented full industry-wide joint state-private ownership in the fourth quarter of last year, it underwent preliminary economic reorganization. Starting in the second quarter of this year, most of the state-owned and joint state-private factories in the entire industry, except for a few smaller factories, have implemented three-shift production day and night. This year alone, the output of worsted fabrics has increased more than four and a half times compared to 1952. The worsted wool fabrics and blankets produced by various factories are sold to the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and several other countries.

　　According to the engineers responsible for this expansion: the spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing equipment of various woolen mills in Shanghai are unbalanced, and the potential for developing production is significant. This expansion is only a preliminary effort to make reasonable use of the equipment of the main worsted woolen mills. Starting next year, some woolen mills producing coarse wool fabrics will also be expanded under the same principle. Currently, various factories are still formulating further expansion plans.

### 上海七个毛纺织厂开始扩建  完工后每年可增产精纺呢绒二百万公尺

    上海七个毛纺织厂开始扩建
    完工后每年可增产精纺呢绒二百万公尺
    新华社上海27日电　新华社记者高洁报道：上海有七个毛纺织厂最近开始了解放以后的第一次扩建工程。这些扩建工程全部完工以后，每年可以增产精纺呢绒二百万公尺以上。这次扩建的总投资是二百万元，大约在投入生产以后的两个月之内，就可以从生产利润和缴纳给国家的税金中收回。
    七个扩建厂当中，六个是精纺毛纺织厂，一个是绒线厂。这次扩建，全部都是利用各厂现有的空余厂房和一万多锭闲置多年未用的毛纺锭。因此，扩建时间只须三个月到半年左右，所需投资也少。以生产精纺织物著名的公私合营章华毛纺织厂原有一处空厂房，去年并进新合营的大公、振丰等毛纺织厂以后，织机和染整设备都有富余，这次将公私合营寅丰毛纺织厂闲置未用的二千六百多枚精纺纱锭装出，投资只需三十万元左右，一年就可以多生产四十万公尺以上的精纺织品。公私合营裕民毛纺织厂厂房比较宽敞，只须将现有设备稍加调整，不须添建厂房就可以安装一万精纺纱锭。这次同时进行扩建的还有公私合营新华纶、元丰、华丰等毛纺织厂和公私合营裕华棉毛麻纺织厂的毛纺部分。国营上海第二毛纺织厂新近扩建的一千二百枚精纺纱锭，已经在七月初投入生产。
    上海毛纺织工业在去年第四季度实行全行业公私合营以后，就进行过初步的经济改组。今年二季度开始，全行业除了几个较小的厂以外，其他国营和公私合营厂大部分都实行了日夜三班生产。今年单是精纺织物的产量就比1952年增加四倍半以上。各厂生产的精纺呢绒和毛毯等，远销到苏联和德意志民主共和国等好几个国家。
    据负责这次扩建的工程师谈：上海各类毛纺织厂的纺、织、染整设备都不平衡，发展生产的潜力很大。这次扩建，只是初步把主要精纺毛纺织厂的设备加以合理利用。从明年起，部分粗纺毛纺织厂也将在这样的原则下进行扩建。目前，各厂还在拟定进一步的扩建计划。
