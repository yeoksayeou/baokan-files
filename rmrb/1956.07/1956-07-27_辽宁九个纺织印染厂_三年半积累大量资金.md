    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 26th. The nine state-owned cotton textile and dyeing factories in Liaoning Province, in the first three and a half years of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, have turned over to the state funds which, after deducting the state's investment in these nine factories, would be sufficient to build eighteen new factories of the same scale.
    In the past few years, the state's investment in these factories has not been large, only more than 17 million yuan, used to add some cotton suction devices, fiber impurity separators, and build some necessary factory buildings. The funds accumulated by the nine factories for the state are mainly due to the creative labor of the workers of these factories using the original equipment. In the past few years, the workers of these factories have studied and promoted dozens of major domestic and foreign advanced experiences such as the "1951 Weaving Method" and the "1953 Maintenance Method," thus greatly improving their technical level, improving production management, reducing costs by an average of 1.12% per year, and improving product quality year by year. For example, the percentage of first-class cotton cloth was 94.8% in 1952, and by the first half of this year, it had increased to 99.34%. They have also come up with many ways to save cotton and yarn, reducing the amount of cotton used per yarn by 6.56 jin in 1955 compared to 1952; the quality of the yarn has also improved compared to the past.
    In the past few years, the textile and dyeing factories have also increased many new varieties based on the gradual improvement of people's living standards. The state-owned Xiong Yue Dyeing Factory alone has added hundreds of varieties of printed and colored fabrics. This year, new products such as summer lace skirt fabrics produced by this factory have been praised by consumers.

    辽宁九个纺织印染厂
    三年半积累大量资金
    新华社沈阳26日电　辽宁省的九个国营棉纺织和印染工厂，在执行第一个五年计划的前三年半中，缴给国家的钱除去国家向这九个厂的投资外，还可以建设同样规模的十八个新工厂。
    在过去的几年中，国家向这几个厂的投资并不多，只用了一千七百多万元，增添了一些吸棉装置、纤维杂质分离机等设备，修建了一些必要的厂房。九个工厂为国家积累的这批资金，主要是这些工厂的职工们利用原有设备进行了创造性的劳动。这几个工厂的职工在过去的几年中，曾经学习和推广了“1951织布工作法”、“1953保全工作法”等几十种主要的国内外先进经验，因而大大地提高了技术水平，改进了生产管理，使成本每年平均降低1.12％，产品质量逐年提高。如棉布的正品率，1952年是94.8％，到今年上半年，已经提高到99.34％。他们在节约用棉和用纱方面，也想了很多办法，使每件纱的用棉量在1955年比1952年降低了六点五六市斤；纱的质量也比过去有所提高。
    各纺织和印染厂，在过去几年中，根据人民生活水平的逐年提高的情况，还增加了很多新品种。仅国营熊岳印染厂增加的各种花布、色布，就有好几百种。今年，这个厂生产的夏季花边裙子布等新产品，受到消费者的赞扬。
