Editorial:

    The State Council issued the "Instructions on Developing Pig Raising" on July 1st, specifying targets for developing pig production for all parts of the country in the next two years. After these targets are achieved, agricultural areas in North and Northwest China will have an average of one to one and a half pigs per household; the vast areas of the Yangtze River basin will have an average of one and a half to two pigs per household; and the southern and northeastern provinces, as well as the suburbs of large cities, will have an average of two to two and a half pigs per household. By the end of next year, the number of pigs in our country should increase by about one time compared to now.
    Is it possible to raise so many pigs in two years? This is a question that needs to be answered. In the past, most of the piglets raised by farmers in our country were supplied by people who specialized in breeding pigs. However, at that time, the amount of pigs raised did not increase quickly. Now that so many pigs need to be increased in two years, it will not work to rely on those who specialize in breeding pigs. The experience in many places is: everyone should breed piglets themselves, breeding as many as they raise. This can not only ensure the supply of a large number of piglets, and prevent piglets from spreading diseases everywhere, but also enable agricultural cooperatives and farmers to save a lot of money on buying piglets.
    Many areas currently lack sows, and this problem must be solved first. Sichuan and other provinces have taken many measures to increase the number of sows. For example, publicizing the benefits of raising sows to breed piglets, restricting the castration of young sows, and increasing feed supply for sows that breed piglets, these have all had a great effect. From January to March this year, Sichuan Province has already increased the number of sows by 400,000. It can be seen that this problem is not too difficult to solve. The problem still lies in getting through the minds of agricultural cooperative cadres, so that they understand how to calculate the big picture and understand the benefits of raising more pigs.
    Ensuring an adequate supply of feed is an important condition for raising more pigs. The most important reason why some farmers are unwilling to raise pigs now is the lack of feed. For several years, all regions have advocated fully utilizing wild weeds to feed pigs. This natural resource must continue to be fully utilized in the future. However, in order to complete the task of raising a large number of pigs, relying solely on wild weeds is far from enough. Now that agricultural production is developing day by day, and the yield per unit area and total output of grain are constantly increasing, it is possible to allocate a portion of the grain as feed for pigs. From July 1956 to June 1957, the state allocated one billion jin of grain, paid in advance to farmers in key pig-producing areas, to pre-purchase pigs. However, some people dare not allocate part of the grain as feed for developing pig production, because they are afraid of wasting grain. In fact, the grain used to raise pigs will not be wasted in vain. With more pigs raised, there will also be more manure, which can increase the fertilizer in the fields and greatly increase grain production. In these places, we should calculate the big picture, not the small picture. This big picture will only benefit the country and the farmers, and will not harm them.
    To raise more pigs, we must also pay close attention to preventing and controlling pig diseases. At present, the work of preventing and controlling pig diseases is still very weak, the production of biological drugs cannot yet meet the actual needs, there are still very few veterinary technicians, the folk veterinarians scattered in the vast rural areas have not yet played a good role, many effective epidemic prevention experiences among the masses have not yet been summarized and promoted, and methods and systems for preventing animal epidemics that are jointly observed by agriculture, commerce, transportation and other departments have not yet been established. It is hoped that relevant departments will regard the prevention and control of pig diseases as a major event, not as a minor event, so as to avoid major losses in the event of an epidemic.
    The prices for purchasing live pigs in many areas are currently too low, which is extremely detrimental to the development of pig production. When farmers were individually operated, they often did not calculate the labor cost for their agricultural and sideline products. Even if the purchase price was lower at that time, the impact on pig production was not too great. After agricultural cooperativization, both agricultural cooperatives raising pigs and members raising pigs must calculate labor remuneration. Under such circumstances, if there is no profit in raising pigs, farmers will naturally be unwilling to raise pigs and will want to do other things. In areas where the purchase prices of live pigs are currently too low, the purchase prices are being adjusted, which will have a significant effect on raising farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs.
    Farmers are happy to raise pigs, but they need assistance. The State Council's instructions will provide them with many necessary conditions and practical assistance.

### 算大账，多养猪

    算大账，多养猪
    国务院在七月一日发布“关于发展养猪的指示”，给全国各地规定了今明两年发展生猪的指标。这个指标实现以后，华北、西北农业地区，平均每户就要有一头到一头半生猪；长江流域广大地区，平均每户就要有一头半到两头生猪；南方和东北各省以及大城市的郊区，每户平均就要有两头到两头半生猪。到明年年底，我国生猪的数量，就要比现在增加一倍左右。
    在两年里要养这么多的生猪，是不是可能的呢？这是应该回答的问题。我国农民过去饲养的小猪，大部分是由专门饲养种猪繁殖小猪的人供应的。但是，那个时候，生猪的饲养量增加不快。现在却要在两年当中增加这么许多生猪，依靠专门饲养种猪繁殖小猪的人来供应就不行了。许多地方的经验是：大家动手繁殖小猪，饲养多少就繁殖多少。这不但能够保证供应大量小猪，能够防止小猪到处流动传布疫病，而且能够使农业合作社和农民节约许多购买小猪的资金。
    目前许多地区缺少母猪，这个问题要先解决。四川和其他省区曾经采取许多方法增养母猪。例如，宣传饲养母猪繁殖小猪的好处，限制阉割小母猪，给繁殖小猪的母猪增加饲料供应，这些都有很大作用。从今年一月到三月，四川省已经增加母猪四十万头。可见这个问题要解决也不太困难。问题还在于打通农业合作社干部的思想，使他们懂得算大账，懂得多养猪的好处。
    保证供应充足的饲料，是多养猪的重要条件。现在有些农民不愿意养猪，最重要的原因是饲料不足。几年以来，各个地区都提倡充分利用野生杂草喂猪的办法。这种天然资源今后还要充分利用。但是，为着完成大量养猪的任务，单靠野生杂草就很不够了。现在农业生产日益发展，粮食单位面积产量和总产量不断增加，拨出部分粮食作为生猪饲料是可能的。从1956年7月到1957年6月的粮食年度中，国家拨出十亿斤粮食，事先付给重点产猪区的农民，预购生猪。但是，有些人不敢拨出部分粮食作为发展生猪的饲料，他们害怕浪费粮食。其实，养猪的粮食是不会白花的，猪养多了，积粪也多，可以增加田里的肥料，大大提高粮食产量。在这些地方应该算大账，不要算小账。这笔大账，对国家、对农民都只有好处，没有坏处。
    要想多养猪，还要切实注意防治猪疫。目前防治猪疫的工作还很薄弱，生物药品的生产还不能满足实际的需要，防疫的技术人员还很少，分散在广大农村的民间兽医还没有很好地发挥作用，群众中许多有效的防疫经验还没有总结和推广，为农业、商业、交通运输等部门共同遵守的防止畜疫的办法和制度还没有建立起来。希望有关部门，把防治猪疫看作一件大事，不要把它看作小事，免得一旦畜疫流行，造成重大损失。
    许多地区目前收购生猪的价格偏低，这对发展生猪极为不利。农民在个体经营的时候，对自己生产的农副产品，常常并不计算劳动代价。当时的收购价格即使低些，对生猪生产的影响也不太大。农业合作化以后，农业合作社养猪和社员养猪，都要计算劳动报酬。在这种情况下，如果养猪无利，农民自然就不愿意养猪，而想作别的事情了。现在生猪收购价格偏低的地区，正在调整收购价格，这对提高农民养猪的情绪，会有不小的作用。
    农民是乐于养猪的，但是他们需要援助。国务院的指示，会使他们得到许多必要的条件和实际的援助。
