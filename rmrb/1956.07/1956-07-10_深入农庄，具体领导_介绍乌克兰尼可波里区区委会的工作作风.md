Going Deep into Farms, Specific Leadership
    --Introducing the Working Style of the Nikopol District Committee of Ukraine
    Ji Wei
    Readers in our country are likely quite familiar with the Nikopol District of Ukraine, USSR. When our country was building the seamless steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, the technicians and workers from the famous Southern Steel Pipe Plant there provided us with great assistance; the world-renowned Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station is nearby, and the Kakhovka Sea, a man-made sea built for the construction of this hydroelectric station, occupies a large area of this district.

    The Nikopol District is located in the southern part of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and is an advanced area of the oblast. The Nikopol District has a rural population of 40,000, with 25 collective farms occupying 80,000 hectares of cultivated land and 14,000 collective farm members (9,000 laborers). After the September 1953 Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, the people of the Nikopol District proposed a plan to double the annual grain output in three years. Last year, the grain harvest increased by 80% compared to 1953.

    After the September Plenum, the District Committee strived to make the leadership of the Party organization go deeper into the grassroots and make the political and organizational work of the Party organization a practical guarantee for increasing agricultural production. In terms of organizational form, after the September Plenum, four work groups of the District Committee stationed at the tractor stations were established to conduct specific and timely leadership over agricultural production on behalf of the District Committee. Now the District Committee has six secretaries and a total of twenty-two cadres (excluding clerical and technical staff), of which four secretaries and seven instructors are stationed below. Comrade Pilyuginov, the First Secretary of the District Committee, gave some examples to illustrate the benefits of the change in organizational form. On the morning of May 16th, the secretaries stationed at the stations returned to the district to meet with the delegation of Chinese journalists. The District Committee took advantage of the short time before the meeting to hold a meeting of the Standing Committee of the District Committee to discuss the thinning of corn seedlings. Comrade Pilyuginov said that in order to solve such an important issue, in the past, it would have been necessary to summon the Party branch secretaries and chairmen of more than twenty collective farms to the District Committee for a half-day meeting to report on the situation of each farm and discuss solutions. Now, with four secretaries stationed below for a long time, they are very familiar with the situation of each farm and have already begun to study the characteristics of this year's work, so this Standing Committee meeting was able to concentrate the situation of each farm in a short time and smoothly discuss feasible solutions.

    Comrade Pilyuginov said that in the past, when the District Committee discussed issues and made resolutions, it often only called for what to do, but paid little attention to how to do it and what specific difficulties were encountered in the specific implementation. In contrast, during last year's wheat harvest, the District Committee decided to promote the "staggered harvesting method of wheat" (harvesting in stages according to the maturity of the wheat field, cutting it down and letting it dry before threshing). After the District Committee meeting, the stationed work groups held training courses on the staggered harvesting method at the tractor stations. The stationed secretaries and instructors also went deep into the farms to conduct specific guidance. For example, the leading comrades of the Mirensky Collective Farm did not approve of this method, so the stationed secretary and instructor stayed at this farm for a few days, studied the benefits of the staggered harvesting method with the farm's cadres, and conducted experiments on the new and old harvesting methods in the field, convincing the farm's leaders both theoretically and practically, and turning the District Committee's resolution into action.

    The main responsible comrades of the District Committee spend most of their time doing specific work at the grassroots level. How does the First Secretary implement the principle of collective leadership in making important decisions? Comrade Pilyuginov said that the actual work requires a close combination of collectivity and timeliness. It is naturally not good to violate collective leadership, and it is not good to delay work either. Holding meetings is naturally a very important way to reflect collective leadership, but it is not the only way. In early May, they found that there were many weeds in the fields. In order to solve the weeding problem in a timely manner, it would take a whole half-day to convene a meeting of the Standing Committee. The First Secretary, the Second Secretary, and the Chairman of the District Soviet first worked out a preliminary opinion, and then called each member of the Standing Committee to discuss it separately. It only took less than two hours to solve the problem. Within one or two hours, the stationed secretaries and instructors went separately to the collective farms to lead the members to start weeding the cultivated crops.

    At the Solokhov Tractor Station, we also learned about the District Committee's in-depth leadership. Comrade Magresh, the stationed secretary of the District Committee at the station, said that the stationed secretaries and instructors go to the fields and livestock farms of the farms every day, purposefully get to know more people, discover and help solve various specific problems. For example, the Molotov Farm was originally relatively backward. The instructor lived there and found that the main reason for the farm's backwardness was that the farm chairman lacked economic knowledge, and lived twelve kilometers away from the farm, and often did not go to work; the branch secretary was also the vice-chairman, and did not supervise the chairman. The instructor discussed ways to improve with the farm's cadres and members, and everyone requested another election of the chairman and secretary. The instructor group studied the work of this farm, submitted a report to the District Committee, and proposed that the District Committee select someone with agricultural specialized education and organizational skills to be the chairman. The District Committee recommended Comrade Skalanov, the Second Secretary of the District Committee, to the Molotov Farm. The farm's members' congress happily accepted the District Committee's recommendation and elected Skalanov as chairman. The farm's branch congress also elected another secretary. The stationed instructor group continued to help the farm improve all aspects of its work. For example, the milk yield of the livestock farm was not high. The instructor group studied with the farm branch and found that although the total milk yield was not good, one milkmaid, Vera, had a very high milk yield. It turned out that she treated the cows she managed differently, allocating more feed to the cows with higher milk yields. The instructor group studied and summarized her working methods with the livestock technician and organized all the milkmaids to learn from this advanced experience. Now, the milk yield has generally increased, and this backward farm has become an advanced farm.

    Comrade Prisheba, the chief agronomist of the Solokhov Station, believes that since the District Committee established the stationed work group, there has been a significant improvement in conducting expert leadership over agricultural production and increasing output by improving agricultural technology. The comrades of the stationed group and the chief agronomist go to the farm together almost every day to jointly study and improve agricultural technology. Every month, they also convene all the agronomists, tractor team leaders, and field team leaders of the station to study major technical issues. This kind of study meeting is often held before an important farming operation. For example, in the past, land was always cultivated in the old way, regardless of the land, what crops were planted, or what the climate conditions were, it was always cultivated to a depth of 20 centimeters. Before planting corn last year, research and experiments were conducted, proving that it was only necessary to cultivate to a depth of 7 or 8 centimeters. After shallow plowing, labor and fuel were saved, and output was increased.

    The First and Second Secretaries of the District Committee, who are responsible for leading the overall work of the entire district, do not just stay in the District Committee's office to issue orders because there are four secretaries stationed below. The typical workday of Comrade Pilyuginov, the First Secretary, is as follows: he starts work at eight o'clock in the morning, handles official business in the district from eight to ten o'clock, and is in the farm almost every day after ten o'clock. From ten o'clock to twelve o'clock in the evening is his study time. He himself graduated from the Kharkov Agricultural Institute, worked as the editor-in-chief of the district newspaper, then worked as the chairman of the District Soviet for five years, and then worked as the Second Secretary of the District Committee for two years. He has been the First Secretary for five years now. He often goes deep into the masses and studies various practical production and technical issues in the local area. For example, the weather was particularly cold this year, and the ground thawed very late, so he went to the Mirensky Farm and, together with the chief agronomist Shulyin and the station director Aleinik, studied whether it was possible to sow barley and oats before the land was completely thawed. The research and experiments proved that as long as the ground thawed to a depth of 5 to 8 centimeters, it was possible to sow. Now he is leading a group of technicians and advanced producers in the district to prepare to spend a month and a half studying how to reduce the cost of various agricultural products.

    Improving the economic knowledge of the grassroots Party organization's workers and helping them carry out political work in conjunction with economic work is an important method for the District Committee to conduct specific leadership at the grassroots level. Comrade Marchenko, the Director of the Organization Department of the District Committee, told us that the District Committee selects an advanced production unit every month and convenes members of the District Committee, farm secretaries, and District Committee instructors to go to this advanced unit to learn from advanced experiences. At each of these study meetings, more time is spent specifically studying a specific economic issue, such as reducing costs, milking, and pig fattening. This April, it was convened at the Gorky Farm. At this study meeting, Comrade Moloylo, the secretary of the farm, reported on the experience of political work (taking 45 minutes); Comrade Shymak, the editor-in-chief of the district newspaper, reported on the experience of wall newspapers and physical object mobilization (taking 35 minutes); Comrade Avchalinko, the chairman of the farm, reported on the experience of how to reduce the cost of agricultural products (taking one hour).

    The Nikopol District Committee not only sends one-half of its staff to be stationed at the lower levels on a regular basis, not only recommends the district's excellent cadres to be the leaders of the farms (this February, it recommended four District Committee instructors to be the chairmen or secretaries of the farms), but also pays attention to cultivating grassroots cadres and promoting them to work in the District Committee, so that more of the District Committee's staff come from the grassroots and are familiar with the local actual situation. There is a Party member, Comrade Sharikov, in the Gorky Collective Farm. After graduating from the ten-year school, he worked in the field work team and was elected as the secretary of the farm's Youth League branch (without leaving production). The comrades of the District Committee found that he had organizational talent, good character, and good production, so they planned to cultivate him. The District Committee officially assigned him to help the work of three Party groups, invited him to the District Committee for short-term training, and in 1951, transferred him to the Organization Department of the District Committee to work as an instructor, working and continuing to cultivate him at the same time. First, he was allowed to study in the political night school for two years. After graduating from the three-year correspondence secondary agricultural school next year, he will be sent to the Party school of the state to study away from work for three years, and then return to work. The District Committee of this district now has eleven instructors, eight of whom have been cultivated from grassroots organizations using this method over the years.

    Comrade Karasnik, the secretary of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Committee in charge of agricultural work, believes that the Nikopol District Committee has done a better job in both political and economic work, and has better implemented the resolutions of the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Last year, the total income per 100 hectares of land in the district was twice the average total income per 100 hectares in the entire state; last year, it was the first to complete the state's requisition and purchase plan for agricultural products; this year, it was the first to complete the spring sowing plan; it was the first to propose the struggle to reduce the cost of agricultural products, and the first to establish an economic committee of the District Committee to continuously study and improve the specific economic work of the district.

    深入农庄，具体领导
    ——介绍乌克兰尼可波里区区委会的工作作风
    季委
    我国的读者对于苏联乌克兰的尼可波里区，是比较容易熟悉的。在我国建设鞍钢无缝钢管厂时，那里有名的南方钢管厂的技术人员和工人给了我们很大的帮助；闻名世界的卡霍夫卡水电站就在近边，为了建设这个水电站而建成的人造海——卡霍夫卡海，占用了这个区的大片土地。
    尼可波里区在第聂伯罗彼德罗夫斯克州的南部，是这个州的一个先进地区。尼可波里区有农村人口四万人，二十五个集体农庄共占耕地八万公顷，庄员一万四千人（劳动力九千个）。在1953年苏共中央九月全会以后，尼可波里区的人民提出在三年后谷物的年产量要增加一倍的计划，去年谷物收获量就比1953年增加了80％。
    九月全会以后，区委会就努力使党组织的领导工作更深入基层，使党组织的政治工作和组织工作切实成为增加农业生产的保证。在组织形式上，九月全会以后，成立了四个区委会驻拖拉机站的工作组，代表区委对农业生产进行具体而且及时的领导。现在区委会有六个书记，一共二十二个干部（不包括文书等技术工作人员），就有四个书记和七个指导员驻在下面。区委第一书记彼梁米诺夫同志举了一些例子来说明组织形式改变后的好处。五月十六日上午，驻站书记们为了和中国新闻工作者代表团会面都回到区上，区委会就利用见面前短短的时间，开了一次区委的常委会，讨论了玉米的间苗工作。彼梁米诺夫同志说，为了解决这样重大的问题，照以前的作法一定是召集二十几个集体农庄的党支部书记和主席到区委来开一大半天的会，汇报各农庄的情况，讨论办法。现在有四个书记长期驻在下面，很了解各农庄情况，而且已经开始研究今年这项工作的特点，所以这次常委会就能够在短短的时间内集中各农庄的情况，顺利地讨论出可行办法。
    彼梁米诺夫同志说，过去区委会讨论问题，作出决议后，常常只是号召要作什么，但究竟如何作，具体贯彻中有什么困难，就管得很少。与这种情况不同，去年麦收时，区委会决定要推广“小麦分段收割法”（按照麦田成熟的情况分段收割，割下来让它晒一晒再打），区委会开会以后，驻站工作组就在拖拉机站召开分段收割法的讲习班。驻站书记和指导员还深入各农庄去进行具体领导。比如明任斯基集体农庄的领导同志不赞成这个方法，驻站书记和指导员就到这个农庄去住了几天，和农庄的干部一起研究分段收割法的好处，而且在田间进行新老两种收割法的实验，从理论上和实际上说服了这个农庄的领导人，使区委会的决议变成了行动。
    区委会的主要负责同志大部分时间都在下面进行具体工作，第一书记在决定重要问题上怎样贯彻集体领导的原则呢？彼梁米诺夫同志说，实际工作对领导的要求，是要集体性和时效性密切结合起来，违反集体领导自然不好，拖延了工作也不好。开会自然是体现集体领导的一个很重要的方法，但并不是唯一的方法。五月初，他们发现田里杂草很多，为了及时解决锄草问题，如果召集一次常委会就得一个大半天。第一书记、第二书记和区苏维埃主席三个人就先研究出一个初步的意见，然后分头给各常委委员打电话商量，只花了不到两个钟头的时间，问题就解决了。在一两个钟头内，各驻站书记和指导员就分头到了各集体农庄领导庄员们开始了中耕作物的锄草工作。
    在梭罗何夫拖拉机站，我们也了解过区委会深入领导的情况。区委驻站书记马格勒什同志说，驻站书记和指导员每天都到农庄的田间和饲畜场，有目的地熟悉更多的人，发现和帮助解决各种具体问题。比如莫洛托夫农庄原来比较落后，指导员就住在那里，发现这个农庄落后的主要原因是农庄主席缺乏经济知识，又住在离农庄十二公里的地方，常常不去办公；支部书记是副主席兼任的，对主席不进行监督。指导员就和农庄的干部和庄员研究改进的办法，大家要求另外改选主席和书记。指导员小组研究了这个农庄的工作，向区委会提出报告，提议区委会另外选择一个受过农业专门教育而又有组织才能的人去作主席。区委会就向莫洛托夫农庄推荐区委会的第二书记史卡拉诺夫同志，农庄的庄员大会很高兴地接受区委会的推荐，选史卡拉诺夫为主席。农庄的支部大会也另外改选了一个书记。驻站指导员小组还继续帮助这个农庄改进各方面的工作，比如饲畜场牛奶的产量不高。指导员小组就和农庄支部一起研究，发现总的出奶量虽然不好，但有一个挤奶女工维拉的挤奶量很高。原来她对自己所管理的奶牛采取分别对待的办法，对出奶量多的牛，配给更多的饲料。指导员小组同饲畜师研究和总结了她的工作方法，组织全体挤奶工学习这个先进经验。现在，牛奶产量普遍地提高了，这个落后的农庄也变成了先进的农庄了。
    梭罗何夫站的总农艺师普里谢巴同志认为区委成立驻站工作组以后，对于农业生产进行内行的领导、从提高农业技术来提高产量，有很显著的改进。驻站小组的同志和总农艺师几乎每天都一起到农庄去，共同研究改进农业技术。每月还召集本站的全体农艺师和拖拉机工作队和田间工作队的队长，研究比较重大的技术问题。这种研究会常常在一项重要的耕作工作以前举行。比如以前耕地总是老办法，不管什么地、种什么庄稼、什么气候条件，一律耕二十公分深。去年耕种玉米以前，就进行了研究和实验，证明只耕七八公分就行了。浅耕以后，省人工、省燃料，又增加了产量。
    负责领导全区全面工作的区委会第一和第二书记，并不是因为有四个书记常驻在下面，自己就关在区委会的办公室里发号施令。第一书记彼梁米诺夫同志一般工作日的情况是这样：早晨八点上班，八至十点在区上处理公务，十点以后几乎每天都在农庄，晚上十点至十二点是自己的学习时间。他本人是哈尔科夫农业学院毕业，作过区报的总编辑，以后作了五年区苏维埃主席，作了两年区委第二书记，现在作第一书记已经五年了。他经常深入群众，钻研当地的各种实际的生产技术问题。比如今年天气特别冷，地解冻很迟，他就到明任斯基农庄，和总农艺师舒里因、站长阿列尼克一起，研究是不是不等土地完全解冻也可以播种大麦和燕麦。研究和实验的结果，证明只要地解冻五至八公分，就可以下种。现在他正领导着区里一部分技术人员和先进生产者，准备用一个半月的时间，研究如何降低各种农产品的成本。
    提高基层党组织的工作人员的经济知识、帮助他们结合经济工作进行政治工作，是区委会深入基层进行具体领导的一个重要方法。区委会的组织部长马尔琴科同志告诉我们，区委会每月选择一个先进的生产单位，召集区委委员、农庄书记和区委指导员到这个先进单位去学习先进经验。这种学习会，每次都要用更多的时间来专门研究某个具体经济问题，如降低成本、挤奶、猪的肥育等等。今年四月是到高尔基农庄去召集的。在这次学习会上，由农庄书记莫洛依洛同志报告政治工作的经验（用去四十五分钟时间）；由区报总编辑希马克同志报告墙报和实物鼓动的经验（用去三十五分钟）；由农庄主席阿芙查林科同志报告如何降低农产品成本的经验（用去一小时）。
    尼可波里区的区委会不只是把二分之一的工作人员经常派驻在下层，不只是把区的优秀干部推荐去作农庄的领导人（今年二月就推荐了四个区委指导员去当农庄的主席或书记），而且注意培养基层干部，提拔他们到区委会来工作，使区委更多的工作人员来自基层、熟悉当地实际情况。高尔基集体农庄有一个党员沙里可夫同志，他在十年制学校毕业后在田间工作队工作，被选为农庄青年团的支部书记（不脱离生产）。区委会的工作同志发现他有组织才干，品质好，生产好，就有计划地培养他。区委会正式分配他帮助三个党小组的工作，请他到区委会来受短期训练，1951年又调他到区委组织部来作指导员，一面工作，一面继续培养他。先让他在政治夜校学习了两年，明年在三年毕业的中等农业专科函授学校毕业后，将派他到州的党校去脱离工作学习三年，然后再回来工作。这个区的区委会现在有十一个指导员，其中有八个都是几年来用这种方法从基层组织里培养起来的。
    第聂伯罗彼德罗夫斯克州州委会负责管理农业工作的书记卡拉史尼克同志认为尼可波里区区委会的政治工作和经济工作都做得比较好，是贯彻执行苏联共产党中央九月全会的决议较好的。去年该区一百公顷土地的总收入比全州一百公顷平均总收入多一倍；去年第一个完成国家对农产品的征购和采购计划；今年第一个完成春播计划；第一个提出为降低农产品的成本而斗争，第一个成立区委会的经济委员会来不断研究和改进该区的具体经济工作。
