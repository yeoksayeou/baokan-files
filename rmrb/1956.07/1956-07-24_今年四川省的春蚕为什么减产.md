Why Did Sichuan Province's Spring Silkworm Production Decrease This Year?

Sichuan Province, one of China's main silk-producing areas, saw a decrease of more than 530,000 kilograms in spring cocoon production this year compared to last year. The reporter interviewed the relevant person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture about this matter. The following is his statement.

The main reason for the decrease in spring silkworm production this year is that the sericulture departments, proceeding from subjective needs, distributed too many silkworm eggs when assigning spring silkworm production tasks, resulting in widespread mulberry scarcity.

Sichuan Province distributed a total of 390,000 silkworm cards this spring, an increase of 5.9% over the same period last year. This growth rate is not considered high compared to the past few years. However, when determining this growth rate, the sericulture departments did not make a comprehensive and sufficient assessment of the new situations and problems that emerged in silkworm production this year. For example, they did not adequately consider the increased survival rate per silkworm card (due to most silkworm farmers joining agricultural production cooperatives and the strengthening of sericulture technical guidance work since last winter and this spring), which led to an increase in the amount of mulberry leaves required per silkworm card. They also failed to properly consider the low survival rate of newly planted mulberry trees and the reduced leaf production of old mulberry trees due to excessive harvesting in previous years. As a result, the demand for mulberry leaves exceeded the production capacity of mulberry trees.

Even more seriously, when this unrealistic plan met with the masses and some people reflected that the plan was too high and difficult to complete, the sericulture departments not only failed to humbly listen to the opinions of grassroots cadres and the masses and conduct thorough investigations and research, but instead stubbornly clung to the original plan and demanded its completion within a limited time. As a result, phenomena of commandism emerged in many places. For example, the Pingyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fuxing Township, Zitong County, could only raise 23 to 25 silkworm cards based on its mulberry leaf production. However, the sericulture cadre stationed in the township, in order to complete the task assigned to him by his superiors, called in the cooperative director, asked him to make a self-criticism, and criticized him for "not paying attention to sideline silkworm farming and not implementing the state plan," forcibly assigning the cooperative an additional ten silkworm cards. As a result, the cooperative suffered a severe shortage of mulberry leaves and had to reluctantly discard twenty baskets of young silkworms.

This person in charge said: This kind of subjectivist approach has brought considerable losses to the state and the farmers. In late May this year, when the spring silkworms were about to spin their cocoons, twelve of the thirteen key silkworm-raising counties in the province generally experienced a shortage of mulberry leaves. In some areas with severe mulberry shortages, incidents of stealing leaves,抢 leaves and fighting continued to occur. Due to the lack of mulberry leaves, large numbers of spring silkworms died in various places. In Xichong County alone, the number of silkworms that died and were discarded accounted for more than 12% of the county's total spring silkworms. The surviving silkworms were also not well-fed, resulting in an increase in maggot cocoons and thin-skinned cocoons, which greatly reduced the quality. According to recent statistics: the number of spring cocoons produced in the province only reached 76.7% of the original plan, raw silk production decreased by 2,000 quintals, and silkworm farmers' income decreased by about 2 million yuan. This person in charge said: If the sericulture departments had been less subjectivist at that time, this year's spring cocoons could have had a complete harvest.

Talking about the aftermath of the spring silkworm production decrease, this person in charge said: At present, the sericulture departments are helping agricultural production cooperatives and silkworm farmers who have suffered losses due to reduced production to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn cocoons this year through autumn cocoon pre-purchases and state loans, and are also increasing the raising of a late autumn silkworm crop in areas where conditions permit, in order to make up for the losses in production. At the same time, learning from the lessons of this spring silkworm production decrease, various sericulture areas have re-examined this year's autumn silkworm egg distribution plan, changing the original plan to distribute more than 350,000 cards to more than 320,000 cards, and have formulated measures to strengthen technical guidance for autumn silkworm rearing and mulberry tree cultivation, placing the plan on an active and reliable foundation. It can be seen from the event of this spring silkworm production decrease that when carrying out various tasks, leading organs must conduct thorough investigation and research, estimate the current new situations and new problems and favorable and unfavorable factors, and humbly listen to the opinions of grassroots cadres and the masses, placing the work on a basis that grassroots cadres and the masses believe is indeed reliable and are therefore willing to accept, so as not to turn good things into bad things.

    今年四川省的春蚕为什么减产
    新华社记者　宋禾
    我国蚕丝主要产地之一——四川省，今年春蚕的产茧量比去年减少了五十三万多公斤。记者就这件事访问了四川省农业厅有关部门的负责人。下面是他的谈话。
    造成今年春蚕减产的主要原因是蚕桑部门从主观需要出发，在分配春蚕生产任务时发的蚕种过多，造成普遍桑荒的结果。
    四川省今春共发放了蚕种三十九万张，比去年同期增加了5.9％。这个增长幅度，比过去几年并不算高。可是，蚕桑部门在确定这个增长幅度的时候，对于今年蚕桑生产方面出现的新情况和新问题，没有作全面足够的估计。譬如，对由于去冬今春大部分蚕农加入农业生产合作社和蚕桑技术指导工作加强而引起的每张蚕种的成活率比过去大大增加，以致每张蚕种所需桑叶量也跟着增加的情况，和新栽桑树成活率不高、老桑树由于连年采摘过度因而产叶量下降等情况，都没有很好估计进去。这样，对桑叶的需要便超过了桑树的生产能力。
    更严重的是，当这个脱离实际的计划和群众见面，有人反映计划偏高很难完成的时候，蚕桑部门不但没有虚心听取基层干部和群众的意见，很好地进行调查研究工作，反而死抱着原订计划不放，要求限期完成。这样，在不少地方就产生了强迫命令的现象。例如，梓潼县复兴乡平原农业生产合作社，按社内桑叶产量只能养二十三到二十五张蚕种，但住在该乡的蚕桑干部为了完成上面分配给他的任务，便把社长叫去，要他检讨，并批评这位社长是“不重视养蚕副业，不执行国家计划”，硬给该社又添派了十张蚕种。结果，该社缺桑严重，不得不忍痛倒掉了二十簸箕小蚕。
    这位负责人说：这种主观主义的作法，给国家和农民都带来了不小的损失。今年五月下旬，当春蚕正要上簇结茧时，全省十三个重点养蚕县，有十二个县普遍发生缺桑现象。在一些缺桑严重地区，还不断出现了偷叶、抢叶和打架的事件。由于缺桑，各地春蚕便大批死亡，西充县一地死掉和倒掉的蚕就占该县春蚕总数的12％以上。活着的蚕也因吃不饱，以致使蛆茧、薄皮茧增多，大大降低了品质。根据最近的统计：全省春蚕产茧数只达到原计划的76.7％，生丝产量减少二千公担，蚕农减少收入约二百万元。这位负责人说：如果当时蚕桑部门少一点主观主义，今年的春茧是完全可以丰收的。
    谈到春蚕减产的善后工作，这位负责人说：目前蚕桑部门正通过秋茧预购和国家贷款的方式，帮助减产和赔本的农业生产合作社和蚕农争取今年秋茧丰收，并在有条件的地区，增养一季晚秋蚕，以弥补减产的损失。同时，吸取这次春蚕减产的教训，各蚕桑地区已重新审核了今年的秋蚕发种计划，将原订发种三十五万多张的计划，改为三十二万多张，并拟出了加强秋蚕饲养技术指导和桑树培护的措施方案，把计划放在积极可靠的基础上。从这次春蚕减产的事件中可以看出：领导机关在进行各项工作时，必须很好地进行调查研究工作，把当前的新情况新问题和有利、不利的因素都估计进去，并且要虚心听取基层干部和群众的意见，把工作放在基层干部和群众认为确有把握，因而愿意接受的基础上，才不致把好事办成坏事。
