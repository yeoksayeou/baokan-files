Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 3rd July: In the river valley areas along the Yellow River and Huangshui River in Qinghai Province, wheat plants, three to four feet tall, are flowering and filling with grain. Highland barley is bowing its heads with long awns, and barley heads are beginning to turn yellow. In just over ten days, the early-sown areas will begin harvesting. Wheat seedlings in the dry mountain areas have also grown to over a foot tall.

People, looking at the robust wheat seedlings and thick ears, are making the following optimistic estimates: if no unexpected disasters occur in the future, this year's spring wheat will certainly achieve a bumper harvest, and the province's plan to increase production by 250 million jin compared to last year will be exceeded.

This year, in the Huangshui River basin, the main spring wheat producing area of ​​Qinghai Province, more than nine out of ten mu of river valley land are sown with improved varieties. Small-scale water conservancy projects built by agricultural cooperatives have expanded the irrigated area by 375,000 mu. Rainfall has also been relatively plentiful since sowing, so spring wheat is growing better than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd July: Huang County, Shandong Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest. The average yield per mu for the county's 450,000 mu of wheat reached 280 jin, an increase of 92 jin per mu compared to last year.

The Huang County People's Committee recently summarized the experience of this year's overall wheat bumper harvest, believing that the promotion of improved wheat varieties, advancing the wheat sowing period, and timely winter irrigation are the main reasons for this year's wheat harvest.

    青海早种地区就要开镰收麦
    山东黄县小麦比去年每亩增产九十二斤
    新华社西宁3日电　青海省黄河和湟水两岸的川水地区，三、四尺高的小麦正在扬花、灌浆，青稞低下了带着长芒的穗头，大麦的穗头开始呈现黄色。再过十多天，早种的地区就要开镰收割了。山旱地区的麦苗也都长到了一尺多高。
    人们看着茁壮的麦苗和粗大的穗头，作出这样乐观的估计：如果今后不发生意外灾害，今年的春麦一定获得丰收，全省比去年增产两亿五千万斤的计划将超额完成。
    今年，青海省主要春麦产区的湟水流域各县，每十亩川水地中有九亩多播的良种。农业社修建的小型水利工程扩大的灌溉面积有三十七万五千亩。播种以后雨水也比较充足，所以春麦生长比往年好。
    新华社济南3日电　山东省黄县小麦空前丰收。全县四十五万亩小麦平均每亩产量达二百八十斤，每亩比去年增产九十二斤。
    黄县人民委员会最近总结了今年小麦全面丰产的经验，认为推广小麦良种、提早小麦播种期以及适时冬浇是今年小麦获得丰收的主要原因。
