　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 16th. In the first half of July, the yarn produced by Tianjin's five state-owned cotton mills (with nationally stipulated quality indicators) all reached 100% first-class grade one every day. This is the best phenomenon that Tianjin's state-owned cotton mills have ever had in improving yarn quality since liberation.
　　First-class grade one yarn has fewer cotton knots and impurities, greater tensile strength, and more uniform evenness. Cloth woven from this yarn is strong and smooth.
　　The improvement in cotton yarn quality is mainly due to the fact that factories have been able to improve raw cotton management work as a result of farmers supplying sufficient quantities of raw cotton of good quality.
　　Since the beginning of the third quarter, the raw cotton shipped to Tianjin from various places has mostly had fibers over one inch in length and contains fewer impurities, representing a significant improvement in quality compared to the raw cotton shipped last year. At the same time, the phenomenon of insufficient raw cotton supply in the same period last year has also changed in terms of quantity. The current cotton inventory and the cotton that will be shipped in succession can fully meet the production needs of each factory. Therefore, each factory can reasonably arrange the blending components in advance based on the raw cotton's impurity rate, maturity, and color, etc., under the conditions of sufficient raw cotton, so that the cotton yarn quality can be stabilized.

    天津五个国营棉纺织厂生产的纱支
    上半月全部是一等一级品
    新华社天津16日电　七月上半月，天津市五个国营棉纺织厂所生产的纱支（有国家规定质量指标的），每天都100％的达到一等一级品。这是解放以来天津各国营棉纺织厂在提高纱支质量方面从未有过的好现象。
    一等一级品的纱支，棉结杂质少，拉力大，条干也比较均匀，用这种纱支织出来的布结实而光洁。
    棉纱质量的提高，主要是由于在农民供应原棉数量充足和质量较好的情况下，使工厂有可能改进原棉管理工作的结果。
    进入第三季度以来，各地运来天津的原棉，大部分纤维在一英寸以上，含杂也少，比在去年运来的原棉的质量有显著提高。同时，在数量方面也改变了去年同期原棉供应不足的现象。现在的存棉量和将要陆续运来的棉花，可以充分供应各厂生产的需要。因此，各厂可以在原棉充足的条件下，根据原棉含杂率、成熟度和色泽等，事先合理安排混棉成分，使棉纱质量得到稳定。
