Xinhua News Agency, London, July 4th: A conference of the prime ministers of seven Commonwealth countries was held on the 3rd to discuss defense and military alliance issues. The Prime Ministers of India and Ceylon, who do not participate in military blocs, did not attend the meeting.

According to Reuters, the attendees explored the "defense" strategies and tactics of the Commonwealth in light of the evolution of the international situation.

British representatives at the meeting spoke of their preliminary views on reformulating strategic plans based on the fact that both the East and the West possess hydrogen bombs. Britain advocates that with the possession of hydrogen bombs, conventional military armaments can be reduced, and the resources and strength saved can be used to strengthen the Commonwealth's competitive strength on the economic front.

South African Prime Minister Strijdom advocated the organization of a new military bloc, which should include Britain, the Union of South Africa, the Central African Federation, and France, Belgium, and Portugal, which have colonies south of the Sahara Desert. This new military bloc would automatically become an extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is reported that Britain has remained cold to this proposal. Britain has its own arrangements in Africa.

    英联邦会议讨论军事联盟问题
    印度和锡兰两国总理没有出席
    据新华社4日讯　伦敦消息：英联邦七国总理三日举行会议讨论防务和军事联盟问题。不参加军事集团的印度和锡兰的总理没有参加这次会议。
    据路透社消息，参加会议的人们根据国际局势的演变，探讨了英联邦的“防御”战略和战术问题。
    英国的代表们在会议上谈到他们根据东西方都拥有氢弹这个情况来重新制定战略计划的初步意见。英国主张在拥有氢弹的情况下，可以削减常规军备，而把节省下来的资源和力量用来加强英联邦在经济战线上的竞争力量。
    南非联邦总理斯揣敦主张组织一个新的军事集团，这个集团应当包括英国、南非联邦、中非联邦以及在撒哈拉大沙漠以南的地方拥有殖民地的法国、比利时和葡萄牙等，这个新的军事集团将自动成为北大西洋公约的一种延长。消息说，英国对这个主张一直是冷淡的。英国在非洲另有它自己的安排。
