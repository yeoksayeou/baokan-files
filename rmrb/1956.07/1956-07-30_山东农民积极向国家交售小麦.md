Shandong Farmers Actively Sell Wheat to the State

(Reported by this newspaper) The summer wheat procurement and storage work in Shandong Province has been widely launched. As of July 16, the amount of wheat stored throughout the province has reached approximately 600 million jin.

This year Shandong has a bumper wheat harvest, and the farmers' enthusiasm for selling wheat is particularly high. Farmers generally reflect that they must sell wheat to the state in accordance with the tasks and standards stipulated by the state.

Party and government leaders at all levels in Shandong have successively held meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township (cooperative) levels to specifically explain the procurement policies, methods, and tasks, and have made calculations based on local conditions so that cadres can be sure of their numbers. In order to avoid casualties to people and animals during grain delivery and delays in receiving grain, all localities have established receiving and delivery organizations in advance and carried out warehouse repairs. Some places have also formed grain transportation brigades based on townships and cooperatives, led by the township head or cooperative director as the brigade leader. The grain receiving points in all localities ensure immediate acceptance upon arrival, and they have also prepared hot water, sun shelters, and have doctors on duty.

    山东农民积极向国家交售小麦
    本报讯　山东省夏季小麦征购入库工作普遍展开。到七月十六日，全省入库小麦已达到六亿斤左右。
    今年山东小麦丰收，农民交售小麦的积极性特别高涨。农民普遍反映：一定按照国家规定的任务、标准，把小麦交售给国家。
    山东各级党、政领导事前都先后召开了县、区、乡（社）干部会议，具体交代了征购的政策、办法和任务，并结合本地实际情况进行了计算，使干部都能心中有数。各地为了避免送粮时发生人、畜伤亡事故和接粮不及时等现象，都事前建立了接粮、送粮的入库组织和进行了仓房的修理工作。有些地方还以乡、社为单位组成运粮大队，由乡长或社长任大队长带领。各地接粮的地点作到随到随收，还都准备了热水、凉棚，并有医生值班。
