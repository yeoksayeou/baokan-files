The Secret of "Torrential Flow Scouring Sand"
    Huang Ping

    Sand casting workers used to say that sand casting work is done with eyes open but poured with eyes closed, guaranteeing quality is impossible.

    In the first half of 1955, when the sand casting workshop of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory was casting large components for 300-horsepower diesel engines, the quality of the castings was often unstable. Two of the six diesel engine bodies cast in May were scrapped, and shrinkage cavities often appeared in the cast bodies. A single diesel engine body is cast from two tons of molten iron. Unstable quality of the diesel engine body castings naturally led to huge waste. At the same time, sand casting is the first process in manufacturing diesel engines, and a defective product would affect the entire production plan.

    This matter caused anxiety among workshop leaders and engineering technicians, and even more so among Xu Xizhai, a sand casting worker. Xu Xizhai was a Communist Party member with twenty or thirty years of sand casting experience, and a well-known "level-eight" master worker in the workshop. Now he was watching helplessly as the cast parts were sent to the scrap heap!

    "Why do shrinkage cavities appear in the castings?" In order to figure out this problem, Xu Xizhai checked every action he took with the sand mixture, and from the look of each process, everything seemed normal. "Where is the key to the problem?" For several days in a row, Xu Xizhai couldn't sleep or eat as if he were sick, and was in a state of constant anxiety.

    One day, Xu Xizhai was walking along the Huangpu River. At this time, the Huangpu River was at high tide, and the rolling river water surged towards both banks. With the tumbling of the waves, the soil on the river bank was beaten and fell down with a "swishing" sound.

    Xu Xizhai stared blankly at the magnificent scene on the Huangpu River, and suddenly thought of his diesel engine: "When the tide comes with tremendous force, it will collapse the river bank. What happens when molten iron, carrying a very high temperature, pours down from the gate…?"

    "That's right, the reason for the shrinkage cavities in the diesel engine body castings lies here." Xu Xizhai returned to the factory and carefully checked each process again. As expected, he discovered that the instability in the quality of the diesel engine body castings was due to the excessive impact force of the molten iron. He studied the reasons for the excessive impact force of the molten iron and proposed a rationalization suggestion. This suggestion was implemented after being evaluated by the technical staff, and the "torrential flow scouring sand" accidents no longer occurred in the diesel engine body castings. From May of last year to March of this year, all the 300-horsepower diesel engine bodies cast were 100% finished products. The situation remained good after March.

    Now, the workers in the iron casting workshop all say, "Sand casting work is not done with eyes open and poured with eyes closed. As long as you learn humbly and work hard to study, the life inside the sand box can also be seen."

    “激流冲砂”的秘密
    黄萍
    翻砂工人曾有这样一种说法：翻砂生活是睁着眼睛做，闭着眼睛浇，保证质量是不可能的事情。
    1955年上半年，上海汽轮机厂翻砂车间在浇铸三百匹马力柴油机机身大件的时候，铸件的质量也是经常不稳定的，五月份铸的六只柴油机机身就有两只报废，浇出的机身常有缩孔。一只柴油机身，是用两吨铁水浇成的，柴油机身铸件质量不稳定，自然会造成巨大的浪费。同时，翻砂又是制造柴油机的第一道工序，一出废品就使得整个生产计划受到影响。
    这件事引起了车间领导人员和工程技术人员的焦虑，更引起了翻砂工人许锡斋的不安。许锡斋是一个共产党员，有着二、三十年的翻砂经验，在车间里是个有名的“八级”老师傅。现在他眼睁睁的看着铸出的部件被送到废品堆里去了！
    “铸件为什么会出缩孔呢？”为了弄清这个问题，许锡斋检查了自己操作砂泥的每一个动作，从各道工序看来，好像一切都很正常。“问题的关键在那里呢？”接连几天，许锡斋就像生了病似的睡不着、吃不下，终日惶惚不安。
    一天，许锡斋在黄浦江边散步。这时，黄浦江正是涨潮的时刻，滚滚的江水汹涌地向两岸冲激，随着浪花的翻滚，河岸的泥土被打得“沙沙”地向下落去。
    许锡斋呆呆地看着黄浦江上的雄伟情景，猛然联想到他的柴油机：“当潮水带着巨大的力量来到的时候，会把河岸冲坍，铁水带着很高的温度从浇口冲下去的时候会怎么样呢……”
    “对了，柴油机身铸件出缩孔的原因就在这里”。许锡斋回到厂里，再次细心地检查了各道工序。果然发现，柴油机机身铸件质量所以不稳定，就是因为铁水的冲激力量过大。他研究了铁水冲激力过大的原因，提出了一项合理化建议。这个建议经过技术人员鉴定以后实行了，柴油机身的铸件就不再发生“激流冲砂”的事故。从去年五月到今年三月，浇铸的三百匹马力柴油机身，都是百分之一百的成品。三月以后情况仍然很好。
    现在，铸铁车间的工人都说“翻砂生活，不是睁着眼睛做，闭着眼睛浇，只要虚心学、努力钻研，砂箱里面的生活，也是看得见的。”
