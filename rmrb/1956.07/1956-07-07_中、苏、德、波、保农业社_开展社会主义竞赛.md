Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Agricultural cooperatives in China, the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, and Bulgaria are launching an international socialist competition.

Currently, they have initially proposed specific competition content and conditions based on the different production situations in their respective regions.

The proposal for this competition was put forward by the Soviet and Bulgarian delegations at the Fourth Conference of Chairmen and Activists of Agricultural Production Cooperatives in East Germany, held in Leipzig in December 1955. All delegations participating in the conference expressed their support. The Chinese delegation, invited to attend the conference, then proposed that seven well-known agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms in China compete with seven well-known collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, and Bulgaria.

The seven agricultural production cooperatives proposed by the Chinese delegation to participate in the competition are: the "Jin Xing" Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, and the "Five Star" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Turpan County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, competing with the "Stalin" Collective Farm, a recipient of the Order of Lenin in Ukraine, and the "Eastern Light" Collective Farm in Kazakhstan, respectively; the "Wu Gong Xiang" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, and the "Gao Kan" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shenyang City, competing with the "Engels Cooperative," the "Thälmann Cooperative," and the "Belgrad Cooperative" in East Germany, respectively; the "Patriotic" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, competing with the "Wilanmowa" Cooperative in Opole Province, Poland; and the "Red Star" Collective Farm in Beijing competing with the "Oriental Red" Cooperative in Bulgaria. This proposal by the Chinese delegation was warmly welcomed by the Soviet, East German, Polish, and Bulgarian delegations. The main purpose of this competition is to promptly exchange advanced international agricultural production experiences to further improve agricultural production levels and enhance friendship between countries.

    这个竞赛的倡议，是1955年12 月在来比锡举行的民主德国第四届农业生产合作社主席和积极分子会议上，由参加这个会议的苏联和保加利亚代表团提出的。参加这个会议的各国代表团都表示赞同。应邀出席这个会议的中国代表团当时就提出了我国七个著名的农业生产合作社和集体农庄，和苏联、民主德国、波兰、保加利亚的七个著名的集体农庄和农业生产合作社竞赛。
    中国代表团提出的，参加这个竞赛的七个农业生产合作社是：山西省平顺县“金星”农林牧生产合作社、新疆维吾尔自治区吐鲁番县“五星”农业生产合作社分别和苏联乌克兰列宁勋章获得者“斯大林”集体农庄、哈萨克斯坦“东方之光”集体农庄竞赛；河北省饶阳县“五公乡”农业生产合作社、吉林省蛟河县“幸福之路”农业生产合作社、沈阳市“高坎”农业生产合作社分别和民主德国的“恩格斯合作社、“台尔曼”合作社、“别尔格朗特”合作社竞赛；山东省莒县“爱国”农业生产合作社和波兰阿波列省“维兰莫瓦”合作社竞赛；北京市的“红星”集体农庄和保加利亚的“东方红”合作社竞赛。中国代表团的这个提议，得到了苏联、民主德国、波兰和保加利亚代表团的热烈欢迎。这个竞赛的主要目的是，及时交流国际间先进的农业生产经验，以便进一步提高农业生产水平，并增进国家之间的友谊。
