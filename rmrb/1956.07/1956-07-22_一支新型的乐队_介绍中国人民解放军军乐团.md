    A New Type of Band
    ——Introducing the Military Band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Luo Lang
    People who live in the city may not be too unfamiliar with military bands. Especially in Beijing, from the founding ceremony onwards, every "May Day," "National Day" and other major festivals and ceremonies, people can see a neat and solemn band playing solemn ceremonial music. At grand sports meets and athletic competitions, and in garden parties, we can also see this band in military uniform, playing enthusiastic and beautiful music for the masses.

    This is the Military Band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    Some people think that military bands can only play a few marches. However, our current military band, due to the continuous improvement of wind instruments, is able to equip itself with a variety of expressive instruments; the gradual proficiency of the players has further enabled the military band to break away from the stage of only being able to play marches, and enter into being able to express complex musical pieces of various content, genres and techniques. The military band is constantly growing.

    Last night, the military band held its third public concert in Beijing for the vast audience of the capital. At the concert, not only were marches, dances, and folk song suites created by Chinese composers performed, but also modern and classical pieces from fraternal countries were played. If we listen to the records made by the military band in 1950, we can see how significant their progress has been.

    一支新型的乐队
    ——介绍中国人民解放军军乐团

    生长在城市的人们，对于军乐队也许并不太陌生。特别是在北京，从开国大典起，每逢“五一”、“十一”以及其他的重大节日和典礼上，人们都能看到一队整齐严肃的乐队奏起庄严的典礼音乐。在盛大的运动会和体育竞赛场上，在游园晚会中，我们也会看到这一队穿着军装的乐队，为群众奏起热情、优美的乐曲。
    这就是中国人民解放军军乐团。
    有的人以为军乐队只能演奏几首进行曲。可是，我们现在的军乐团，由于管乐器的不断改进，使军乐团能够装备起各种各样富有丰富表现力的乐器；演奏者技术的逐渐熟练，更使军乐团脱离了只能演奏进行曲的阶段，进到能表现多种内容、体裁和技巧的复杂乐曲。军乐团在不断地成长。
    昨晚，军乐团在北京，向广大的首都听众举行第三次公开的音乐会。会上，不但演奏了我国作曲家创作的进行曲、舞曲、民歌组曲，还演奏了兄弟国家现代的和古典的乐曲。如果我们再去听一下军乐团在1950年灌制的唱片，就可以看出他们有了多么显著的进步了。
