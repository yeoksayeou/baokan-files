Xinhua News Agency, Baise, July 17th: In the western mountainous areas of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, the total output of more than three million mu of wheat, early corn, and early rice planted in the thirteen counties including Baise is expected to reach over 850 million jin, an increase of more than 400 million jin compared to the same period last year.

Currently, farmers of various ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Han, Yao, and Miao, are busy with summer harvesting and planting. Judging from the distribution of crops after harvesting in various places, the income of 90% of members in most cooperatives has increased. In Baise County, all but one of the ninety-seven single-ethnic and multi-ethnic cooperatives increased production. After deducting seeds, public welfare funds, accumulation funds, and public grain, forty of these cooperatives can distribute 70% to 79% of the total income to their members. In Pingguo County, among more than 44,000 peasant households, approximately 41,000 households have increased production and income.

According to the person in charge of rural work here, this region is evergreen and has many mountains and rivers, making it possible to have three crops a year. The main reason for the high grain yield in the first half of this year is the adoption of a series of agricultural production reform measures after the realization of advanced agricultural collectivization, especially the transformation from one crop to two crops.

    合作化带来了美好果实
    桂西僮族自治州十三个县的农民增产增收
    新华社百色17日电　桂西僮族自治州西部山区百色等十三个县，上半年扩大种植的三百多万亩小麦、早玉米和早稻等，总产量可达八亿五千多万斤，比去年同期增产四亿多斤。
    目前，各县僮、汉、瑶、苗等各族农民正忙着夏收夏种。各地从收割后的农作物分配情况看，绝大部分社的90％社员增加了收入。百色县九十七个单一民族社和多民族联合社除一个社保产外，其余社社增产，其中四十个社扣除种子、公益金、公积金和公粮外，可以将总收入的70％到79％分配给社员。平果县共有四万四千多户农民，大约有四万一千多户农民增产增收。
    据此间农村工作部门的负责人说：这个地区四季常青，有山多水，可以一年三种三收，今年上半年粮食获得高额增产，其主要原因是实现高级的农业合作化后，采取了一系列的农业生产改革措施，特别是变一造为两造。
