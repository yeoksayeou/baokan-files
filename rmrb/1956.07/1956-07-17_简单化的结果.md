    The Result of Simplification
    Feng Jun
    Wu Zhike, a Communist Party member of Minqiao Township, Minta District, Gaoyou County, was expelled from the Party. Because he committed four major errors: First, he lost his class stance and married a rich peasant element; Second, he had serious capitalist thoughts, having bought land from peasants and exploited them; Third, he helped rich peasants reclaim land from peasants; Fourth, he abused his power and beat poor peasant Li Ganlin.
    With errors this serious, expelling him from the Party is perfectly justified, and Wu Zhike should have nothing to say.
    However, that's not the case. Wu Zhike felt wronged and often wept over this matter, saying he couldn't die in peace. The county party committee's organization department didn't understand the truth of the matter and didn't care; what about the district party committee? Hearing the branch say that Wu's errors were serious and he should be expelled, they considered Wu's weeping to be nothing more than unreasonable trouble-making, and they could turn a deaf ear to it.
    After the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee learned about this matter, they suspected that there might be other reasons, so they sent two cadres to find out what was going on. After repeated investigations, it turned out that Wu Zhike's errors were both facts and not facts.
    Let's look at the error of "losing his class stance"! Wu Zhike was transferred back from the army in 1953. When he returned, he had no house or wife, so the local peasants introduced him to a widow with a rich peasant background (this widow's husband died of illness in 1947, and she herself had performed well and had joined the agricultural production cooperative). Wu Zhike consulted with the township party branch secretary, Zhou Kaifa, and the district committee member, Yang Xin. With the consent of Zhou and Yang, Wu Zhike married this widow. Even if this is considered an error, Zhou and Yang should be primarily responsible. As for buying land from peasants, it was also true. That was in September 1953, when Wu Zhike had just been transferred back and had no land. The local government didn't allocate him any land, so he bought five mu of land with his demobilization pay in order to make a living. Can this be said to be capitalist thinking? The fact of "exploiting peasants" is as follows: After Wu Zhike was transferred, he consistently worked actively and was elected village chief. After the implementation of the planned grain supply, peasants who lacked grain would often come to the village chief to get certificates to buy grain. When Wu Zhike was working in the fields, some people would also come to him for certificates. Some people, seeing that Wu Zhike was delaying his own production for their sake, would voluntarily help him transplant rice seedlings or cut wheat for a while when he went home to write certificates. If this is called exploitation, then there's no such thing as mutual assistance in the world. Speaking of "helping rich peasants reclaim land," it was also a coincidence: A poor peasant had been allocated four mu of land belonging to the rich peasant widow Wu Zhike married during the land reform in 1946. The five mu of land Wu Zhike bought happened to be near the poor peasant's house, and the four mu of land the poor peasant had been allocated was near Wu Zhike's house. In order to facilitate production, the two sides negotiated and voluntarily exchanged land, and wrote a document with neighbors as witnesses. This was beneficial to both sides, so what was wrong with it? Speaking of Wu Zhike using his power to beat poor peasant Li Ganlin, the matter was like this: When paying agricultural taxes in 1954, Li Ganlin had grain but refused to pay, and also incited others not to pay. At that time, Chen Guotai, a district committee member working in Minqiao Township, and Ding Zhanrong, the township chief, ordered Wu Zhike to "bring Li Ganlin over for processing." Li Ganlin refused to go, and the two of them pulled and shoved each other. Li Ganlin bit Wu first, and Wu returned the favor with a slap. When the investigating comrades asked Li Ganlin about it, he smiled and said, "We both used our hands and feet, there's nothing to say!"
    That's the whole truth of the "error."
    Since the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee has already clarified the facts, it's not that difficult to change the unfair punishment against Wu Zhike. The difficulty lies in changing this simplistic style of not conducting in-depth investigations and research, not considering the causes and consequences and various specific conditions, and only looking at certain superficial phenomena before rashly making judgments and conclusions. If that continues, then a second Wu Zhike, a third Wu Zhike, will continue to appear.

    简单化的结果
    冯俊
    高邮县闵塔区闵桥乡共产党员武志科被开除了党籍。因为他犯了四大错误：一、失去了阶级立场，和富农分子结婚；二、资本主义思想严重，曾买农民的田地和剥削农民；三、帮助富农向农民要回田地；四、利用职权，殴打贫农李干林。
    错误这么严重，开除他的党籍，天公地道，武志科也该没话可说。
    然而不然，武志科感到冤枉，为这件事常常哭泣，说他死也不能闭眼。县委组织部不了解事情的原委，也就不管；区委呢？听支部说武的错误严重，理应开除，武的哭诉只不过是无理取闹，可以闻而不问。
    中共江苏省委组织部知道这件事以后，估计其中可能别有原故，于是派了两个干部前往了解究竟。经过反复调查，原来武志科的错误都是事实，也都不是事实。
    先看“失去立场”的错误吧！武志科是1953年从部队转业回来的，回来后没有房屋、没有老婆，当地农民就给他介绍了一个富农成份的寡妇（这个寡妇的丈夫在1947年病死，她本人表现尚好，已入农业生产合作社）。武志科就请示乡支部书记周开发和区委委员杨鑫。经周、杨二人同意后，武志科才和这个寡妇结了婚。即或说这是错误的话，周、杨二人首先应该负责。说到买农民的田地，也确有其事。那是在1953年9月，武志科刚转业回来，无田无地，当地政府又不分给他田地，他为了生活，就用转业金买了五亩田。这能不能说是资本主义思想呢？“剥削农民”的事实是这样的：武志科转业后工作一贯积极，被选为村长。实行粮食计划供应以后，缺粮农民不时来找村长开买粮证明书。武志科在田里做活的时候，也有人来找他开证明书。有些人看武志科为自己的事耽误生产，就自动地在武志科回家写证明书时替他插会儿秧、割一点儿麦。这如果说是剥削的话，那么天下也就谈不上什么互助了。谈到“帮助富农要回田地”，也算事有凑巧：有个贫农在1946年土地改革时曾分到和武志科结婚的那个富农寡妇四亩田。武志科买的五亩田恰巧靠近那贫农家，那贫农分到的四亩田又靠近武志科家，为了便于生产，双方协商，自愿调换，并写了凭据，有四邻为证。这对双方有利，有什么不好呢？说武志科利用职权殴打贫农李干林，事情是这样：1954年交农业税时，李干林有粮不交，而且鼓动其他人也不要交。当时在闵桥乡工作的区委委员陈国太和乡长丁占荣，命令武志科“去把李干林带来处理”。李干林不去，两个人拉拉扯扯，李干林先咬了武一口，武也回敬了李一记耳光。当调查的同志问到李干林的时候，他笑着说“我们两个都动了手脚，没得说的！”
    整个“错误”事实就是这样。
    既然省委组织部已经查清了事实，要改变对武志科的不公平的处分并不是多么困难的，困难在于改变这种不深入调查研究、不考虑事情的前因后果和各种具体条件，而只看某些表面现象，就轻率的下断语作结论的简单化作风。那么武志科第二，武志科第三就还会不断地出现。
