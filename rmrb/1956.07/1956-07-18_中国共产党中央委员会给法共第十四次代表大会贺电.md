    To the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and to all the delegates of the 14th Congress of the French Communist Party, Comrades:

    On behalf of all its members and the entire Chinese people, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends its sincere and warm congratulations to the 14th Congress of the French Communist Party.

    Under the leadership of its Central Committee headed by Comrade Thorez, the French Communist Party has been unswervingly and independently carrying out the struggle to safeguard national interests, strive for social progress, and consolidate world peace, thereby demonstrating that it is the most loyal defender of the interests of the French nation and people. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are watching with great concern and sympathy the continuous growth of the French Communist Party's prestige among the French people, the increasing unity of the French democratic forces, and the great progress of the French working class under the leadership of the French Communist Party in the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    At a time when the communist movement, regardless of the attacks and provocations of all the reactionary forces in the world, is strengthening the solidarity of the international working class, overcoming errors and shortcomings in its own ranks, and advancing courageously with a hundredfold confidence in the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China wishes the 14th Congress of the French Communist Party a complete success, wishes the French Communist Party new achievements in the struggle to realize the united action of the working class and establish a new people's front, and wishes the French people greater contributions to the efforts to safeguard European collective security, ease international tensions, and develop peaceful friendship and unity among the peoples of all countries.

                      The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                      July 11, 1956
