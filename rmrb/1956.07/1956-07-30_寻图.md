Searching for the Map
    Student of Nanjing Geological School, Duan Ping

    Above the deep mountain forest, the night swallowed the last ray of early summer glow on the horizon.
    Exploration team members returned in twos and threes, the campsite filled with laughter and song. People were lying down, sitting, playing chess, playing cards, playing the harmonica. Only eighteen-year-old Yang Jie stood alone under an ancient tree, listless.
    I asked him what was wrong and learned that he had forgotten his topographic map on the rocky cliff of Niujiao Mountain. He wanted to go back and find it immediately after discovering it, but the captain said there were many wild animals in this forest at night and told him to go in the morning. But he couldn't rest assured, fearing that a bad person would pick it up, as it could also be used as a military map!
    I wanted to blame him a few words, but seeing how regretful he already was, I held back. This young man was good, hardworking, always taking the lead in difficult tasks, and had recently been approved to join the Youth League, making him even more enthusiastic, but he was a bit reckless.
      "Rumble" a thunderclap sounded, a large patch of dark clouds rushed from the southeast corner of the sky, and faint flashes of lightning appeared in the distance. The thunder rumbled intermittently, and a gust of wind almost choked me.
      "A storm is coming!" People deduced from experience and rushed into their tents.
      "Hurry up and find the topographic map, or it will be blown away by the wind and soaked by the rain," Yang shouted as he ran.
    I ran back to the tent, grabbed two flashlights and two sticks, and said to Xiao Xu, "Xiao Yang and I are going to find the topographic map." Xiao Xu was still asking me something, but I had already run far away from the tent.
    Catching up with Xiao Yang, we rushed into the valley. The valley was pitch black, and the cliffs looked like strange giants. The wind howled, and the dense forest rustled. If we were here on a normal day, we would inevitably be timid, fearing that some wild animal would leap out of the dark depths. But at this time, Xiao Yang and I were focused on retrieving the topographic map before the storm, we couldn't be afraid, and we rushed straight ahead. Relying on the yellowish light of the flashlight, the two of us walked hurriedly along the narrow path, one foot high and one foot low. The weeds, thorns, gravel, and branches on both sides constantly pricked and hooked our legs.
    Finally, we arrived at our destination. Xiao Yang darted forward; I was panting, my whole body sticky with sweat, and I just wanted to take a break when I suddenly heard Xiao Yang shouting in panic:
      "The topographic map is gone!"
      "Don't worry, look again." I picked up the flashlight and shone it around, the two of us carefully searched the area. This was a rocky cliff several feet high, in a dangerous terrain, with little flat ground, and a deep gully below the cliff.
      "It might have been blown off the cliff."
      "It must have been." Xiao Yang said, "Let's go down and take a look."
    But when we checked with the flashlight, there was no way down. The straight cliff was divided into several steps, and several pine branches stretched out from the rock crevices, which could be climbed down, but it was too steep, and falling down would be terrible! We had to think of a way!
    Just as we were considering, "Boom—Boom—Boom," earth-shattering thunder exploded overhead, dazzling flashes of light cut through the night sky, and finally, bean-sized raindrops came down with the force of the wind. Obviously, there was no time to hesitate. I untied my trouser belt and said to Xiao Yang:
      "Untie yours too, tie them together, add the rope on the stick, you hold it up there, I'll go down."
      "No, I'll go." Xiao Yang said firmly, tying the rope.
    This was not the time to argue, especially since I couldn't win against Xiao Yang. Besides, I was big and strong, suitable for pulling the rope; Xiao Yang was small and light, making him nimble to go down. The rope was sturdy, but it was a bit short. I held one end, and the other was tied around Xiao Yang's waist. I helped Xiao Yang down the cliff, watching him descend from the first step to the second... This time he was also very careful. As he went down, things went wrong! The rope was not long enough. I called to Xiao Yang, "Wait a minute! See if that tree branch next to you is strong enough? Can you tie the rope to it?"
    "Yes!" Xiao Yang shook the ancient pine tree that stretched horizontally out of the crevice and climbed onto it. I threw the rope down, he caught it, tied it securely, and then continued to descend. Later, his figure gradually blurred, and the pine needles blocked my view, so I couldn't see him at all. I focused all my attention on listening to the movements below, and suddenly heard a "thud" in the distance, followed by Xiao Yang's scream in the distance. I was startled and quickly asked loudly:
      "What's wrong? Xiao Yang!"
    After a pause, I heard Xiao Yang's voice:
  "...Fell... to the bottom of the gully..." The voice was very far away, and I could barely hear it.
    At this time, I was alone on the cliff, the raging storm was still raging, wolves were howling in the depths of the forest behind me, and the surroundings were gloomy and menacing. I couldn't help but feel a chill.
    After a long while, the pine needles rustled, and Xiao Yang called out "I'm coming up," his head already poking out of the pine tree. I asked, "Did you find it?" while grabbing the rope he threw up, pulling him slowly onto the rocky cliff. Xiao Yang was now wearing torn clothes, his hair disheveled, his whole body wet, dirty, and stuck together. But on his back he carried a bundle wrapped in his coat, and I guessed that it must be the precious topographic map inside. When I asked, it was indeed the case, and he said excitedly:
    "It was so hard to find, it was behind a big rock! Luckily, the big rock blocked the rain, and only a few raindrops splashed on the map."
    "Let's go back!" I said, taking off my coat and putting it on him.
    We had only taken a few steps, supporting each other, when "bang bang" several gunshots rang out.
    "I can tell, it sounds like the captain's box cannon." Xiao Yang said.
    Sure enough, soon after, the captain and several other comrades' voices were calling out to us at the same time.

    寻图
    南京地质学校学生　段平
    深山丛林上空，夜幕吞没了天边最后一道初夏的霞晖。
    勘探队员三三两两归来，宿营地里充满了笑声、歌声。人们躺着、坐着，下棋，打扑克，吹口琴。只有那十八岁的杨杰，却独自站在一棵古树底下，没精打彩。
    我过去一问，才知道他把地形图忘在牛角山那个石崖上了。回来发现了想马上去找，队长说这带森林夜晚野兽多，叫明天早上去。可他放心不下，怕给坏人捡去，它也可以当军用地图的呀！
    我有心责怪他几句，但见他已经悔恨得快哭了。这小伙子，本是好样的，吃苦耐劳，什么艰难工作总走在头里，新近批准入了团，劲头更大，可就是有点冒失。
      “轰隆隆”一声响雷，东南角天空上一大片乌云奔来，远处隐隐约约出现闪电。雷声断断续续滚动着，一阵狂风吹得我几乎呛住。
      “暴风雨要来了！”人们根据经验推断，纷纷跑进帐篷去。
      “赶快去找地形图，不然会给风吹跑，给雨淋湿。”小杨边喊边跑。
    我跑回帐篷拿起两支手电筒，两根棍棒，向小徐说了一句：“我和小杨找地形图去。”小徐还在问我什么，我早跑出帐篷老远了。
    追上小杨，我们飞奔进山谷。山谷墨黑一片，悬崖峭壁像一个个奇形怪状的巨人。狂风呼哨，密林发出哗哗回响。要是平日来这里，不免会胆怯，怕那黑压压的深处会窜出一头什么野兽来。但这时候，我和小杨一心想抢在暴雨前找回地形图，顾不上害怕，直往前冲。仗着一道黄澄澄的电筒光，两人高一脚低一脚急走在羊肠小路上。两旁野草荆棘、碎石、树梢不断刺着、勾着我们的腿脚。
    终于来到了目的地。小杨一个箭步窜了过去；我跑得呼赤呼赤直喘气，混身汗粘粘的，正想歇口气，忽听小杨惊慌失措地喊着：
      “地形图没有啦！”
      “别着急，再看看。”我拿起手电筒照着，两人仔细搜索四周，这是一个几丈高的石崖，形势险峻，平地不多，崖下有一条深沟。
      “可能被风吹到崖下去了。”
      “准是。”小杨说：“下去看看。”
    可是用手电筒察看，竟是无路可走。直通的峭壁，倒分成几个台阶，岩缝里还伸出几株松树枝，可以攀着下去，只是太陡，一失足掉下去还得了！必须想个办法！
    正考虑间，“轰——轰——轰”，震天动地的霹雳在头顶爆炸了，耀眼的闪光划破了夜空，豆大的雨点终于乘着风势斜扑下来了。很明显，不容迟疑了。我一面解下系裤皮带，一面对小杨说：
      “把你的也解下来，连在一起，加上棍棒上的绳子，你在上面拉着，我下去。”
      “不，我去。”小杨坚决地说，一面系着绳子。
    不是争论的时候，何况是争不过小杨的。再说我个子大力气大，拉绳合适；小杨个小轻巧，下去灵便。绳子还结实，只是短了些，一端我拉着，一端系在小杨腰里。我帮着小杨下了石崖，看他从第一个台阶下到第二个……，这回他倒也小心翼翼。下着下着，糟糕！绳子不够了。我叫小杨：“等一等！你看你旁边那树枝牢固不？系上绳子行不行？”
    “行！”小杨摇了摇那从崖缝里横伸出来的古松，就攀了上去。我把绳子抛下去，他接着系好，又重新往下下。以后他的身影逐渐模糊，松叶又遮住了我的视线，完全看不见了。我全神贯注地倾听下面的动静，忽然远远传来“咕咚”一声，接着又听见小杨在远处的尖叫。我吓一跳，忙大声问：
      “怎么啦？小杨！”
    停了一下，才听见小杨的声音：
  “……摔了……，到沟底啦……”声音很远，已听不真切。
    这时我一个人站在崖上，狂风暴雨依旧在逞威，背后树林深处饿狼在嗥叫，四周阴森逼人。我不禁寒毛直竖。
    半晌半晌，松叶悉悉索索响动了，小杨叫着“我上来了，”头已探出松树上来。我一面问“找到没有”，一面抓住他抛上来的绳子，拉着他慢慢上了石崖。小杨这时衣衫破残，头发凌乱，浑身上下又湿又脏，粘在一起。只是他背上背着用外衣包着的包儿，我猜想那里面定是那宝贝地形图。一问，果然是的，他兴奋地说：
    “好难找，在一块大石后面呢！幸好大石挡住了雨，图上才溅着几点雨星子。”
    “快回吧！”我说着，脱下外衣罩在他身上。
    两人挟搀着走没几步，“砰砰”几声枪响。
    “我听得出，这好像是队长的那只盒子枪。”小杨说。
    果然，不久，队长和好几个同志的声音同时在唤叫着我们。
