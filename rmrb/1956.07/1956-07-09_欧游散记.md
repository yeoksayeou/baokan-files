　　The International Theater Festival in Paris

Due to the International Theater Festival being held in Paris, as Parisians say, "Paris is already the theater capital of the world." Among the performances by nearly twenty countries participating in the first International Theater Festival, there were many we didn't have the opportunity to see. Of the few performances we did see, the American and East German performances were the most interesting to us.

America performed two plays. One was called "Medea," which depicts an ancient Greek tragedy: a wife, in order to avenge her husband's infidelity, kills her own two sons. This is a poetic drama, written by the poet Jeffers. The actress playing the lead role of Medea was the famous American actress Anderson. It should be said that the director and many actors are talented. However, the theme of this play cannot but force the actors to overemphasize the terrifying, hysterical aspects of the performance. However, it is said that this is already a relatively serious drama in the United States. In a country flooded with films and dramas with themes of assassination, rape, robbery, and pornography, artists have no choice but to pursue these themes of perverted psychology and false dramatic effects of passion. The other program performed by the United States was called "The Skin of Our Teeth," which depicts modern American life. Unfortunately, we were unable to see the performance, but the name of this play is also a bit strange.

The East German performance was called "The Caucasian Chalk Circle," which was adapted from the Chinese Yuan Dynasty play "The Chalk Circle." In this performance, mask-like makeup was used to highlight the characters' personalities. It also used Chinese-style landscape painting backdrops to explain many of the scenes in the play, and cleverly used a simple revolving stage to achieve changes in scenery and enhance the performance effect. Especially because the "Sarah Bernhardt" theater in Paris is an old-fashioned theater without revolving stage equipment, the Berlin Theater of East Germany specially transported a complete set of revolving stage equipment from its own country. The director was the outstanding artist Brecht, and the female lead was Helen Weigel, a famous actress of the older generation in Germany. Superb acting skills, stylized and emotionally rich recitation, and unique performance methods (sets, makeup), earned them the praise they deserved in Paris. According to German friends, "This is a subject matter from China, so in terms of performance methods, we have also received a lot of inspiration from your dramatic art." Seeing their excellent performance and their respect for Chinese dramatic culture deeply moved our Chinese artists.

The Museum of Modern Art and Others

The building of the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris is itself modernist. On the outside, there are many Roman-style columns; while inside, it is entirely modern decoration: all floor-to-ceiling steel windows, simple square columns, square grid ceilings, and cylindrical chandeliers. As a museum, the walls have more space to hang pictures, and the light is exceptionally abundant, which is much more suitable than the old-fashioned factory buildings of the Louvre being used as exhibition halls.

In this museum, which specializes in displaying modern art, most of the works are modernist, and many of them are difficult to understand. However, there are still many powerful works in the sculpture section: "Portrait of France" made by Bourdelle in 1919, which well shapes the writer's contemplative image. "Female Statue" made by Maillol from 1920 to 1925, symbolizes the innocence and freedom of French girls. "White Bear" made by Pompon in 1925, uses the simplest lines and images to vividly express the animal's shape and posture.

In another Guimet Museum, there is a good collection of oriental art; another smaller Cernuschi Museum has most of its collection as Chinese art. When we visited these two museums, we presented them with some of our country's recent illustrated catalogues of cultural relics and archaeological reports. The experts at the museums were very moved when they saw our illustrated catalogues of cultural relics unearthed during basic construction. One lady frankly said, "I didn't expect that you could still take care of these things when you were having a revolution."

    巴黎的国际戏剧节
    由于国际戏剧节在巴黎举行，像巴黎人说的那样：“巴黎，已经是世界戏剧的首都了”。在参加第一届国际戏剧节的将近二十个国家的演出里，有许多我们没有机会看到，在看到的少数演出中，使我们最感到兴味的是美国和民主德国的演出。
    美国演出两个剧目。一个叫“美狄亚”，是描写一个古希腊的悲剧：一个妻子为了报复丈夫对爱情的不忠，她杀死了自己的两个亲生儿子。这是一个诗剧，是诗人杰非尔斯写的。扮演美狄亚这个女主角的，是美国的名演员安德生。应该说导演和许多演员都是有才能的。但这剧本的主题却不能不使演员过多地强调恐怖、歇斯底里这方面的表演。然而，据说这在美国已经是比较严正的戏剧了。在泛滥着以暗杀、强奸、打劫、色情为主题的电影和戏剧作品的国家，艺术家们也只好追求这些变态心里、激情的虚伪戏剧效果的主题了。美国演出的另一个节目叫做“我们牙齿上的皮”，是描写美国现代生活的，可惜没有能看到演出，但这个戏剧的名字也未免太奇怪了一些了。
    民主德国的演出叫“高加索的石灰圈”，是根据我国元曲的“灰阑记”改编的。这个演出中，用了面具式的化装，把人物性格突出地强调了出来。它还用了中国式的山水画景片，把许多剧中的过场也交代了出来，并且巧妙地用了简单的转台，求得景物变换而加强了演出效果。特别是因为巴黎“沙赫·伯尔纳”剧院是个老式剧院，没有转台的设备，民主德国的柏林剧院特地从自己国内运来了全套的转台装备。导演是杰出的艺术家布莱希特，而女主角是德国老一代的名优海伦·威格尔。精湛的演技，风格化而又情感丰富的朗诵，独特的演出方法（装置、化装置），使他们在巴黎得到应得的赞誉。据德国朋友对我们说：“这是来自中国的题材，因而在表演方法上，我们也从你们的戏剧艺术中得到许多启示。”看到他们的卓越的演出和他们对中国戏剧文化的尊重，使我们中国的艺术家们深为感动。现代艺术博物馆及其他
    巴黎的国立现代艺术博物馆，建筑物本身也是现代主义的。在外部，耸立着很多罗马式的圆柱；而内部，便全然是现代化的装饰了：一色的落地钢窗，简单的方柱，四方格子的天花板，圆桶形的吊灯。作为博物馆，壁面有更多的空间可以悬挂图画，而光线异常充足，比之卢夫宫那样旧式的厂房用作展览室，要合用得多了。
    在这个专门陈列现代艺术品的博物馆中，大多数的作品都是现代主义的，其中有许多作品使人很难了解。但雕刻部分中还有不少很有力的作品：波尔德利作于1919年的“法朗士像”，很好地塑造了这个作家的深思的形象。梅洛尔作于1920—1925的“女像”，象征着法兰西少女的天真、自由的气质，波邦作于1925年的“白熊”，用最简单的线条和形象把动物的形体、姿态都维妙维肖地表现出来了。
    在另一个格米博物馆，有很好的东方艺术的收藏；另一规模小些的赛莫奇博物馆，大部分的收藏是中国艺术品。我们去参观这两个博物馆的时候，送给他们一些我国最近的文物图录和考古报告，博物馆的专家们看到我们的基本建设出土文物图录，都很感动，其中有一位太太率直地说了：“没有想到，当你们革命的时候还能顾到这些事情。”
