    Listen to Both “Good News” and “Worries”
    Comrade Editor:
    Being good at listening to the opinions and reflections of lower-level cadres and the broad masses, and being good at improving one's own work based on these opinions and reflections, is one of the basic conditions for achieving correct leadership. However, judging from the current situation, some Party organizations and some Party leaders are not doing this. They only like to hear "good" feedback from below, and they don't like to hear "bad" feedback. What is called "good" feedback, and what is called "bad" feedback? In the view of the responsible comrades of these Party organizations, presenting views and situations that are inconsistent with the intentions of the leadership, and raising difficulties or negative aspects in the work, are "bad" feedback. Otherwise, it is "good" feedback. Whenever they hear so-called bad feedback, they simply criticize it without analysis and research, simplistically labeling it as "conservative thinking" or "low socialist consciousness," and so on. A responsible comrade in our county once publicly said, when talking about the bad habit of grassroots cadres only reporting good news and not bad news: "I only like to hear good feedback, I don't like to hear bad feedback. When I hear bad news, I will criticize it." There are also district committee secretaries who beam with joy when they hear so-called good reports, and frown when they hear others talk about problems in their work. Of course, shortcomings in work and difficulties in work are not good, but if you plug your ears and don't listen to them, they will not disappear on their own, because they are objective realities. The correct way is only to face the objectively existing backward state and at the same time strengthen your own work to change these backward states.
    As the saying goes, "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened; listen to only one side and you will be benighted." It also says, "The bystander sees clearly, while the person involved is muddled." Why is it that "listen to only one side and you will be benighted"? Why is it that "the person involved is muddled"? It is precisely the result of not being good at listening to the opinions of others and not being good at listening to opinions from all sides. If the leader is in a state of "muddledness" and "benightedness," how can the work be done well? Take the promotion of double-cropping rice this spring, for example. In order to strive for a large increase in production (double-cropping rice is one of the keys to increasing production), the leading cadres in many places made plans without regard to subjective and objective conditions, and blindly expanded the area of double-cropping rice. Although the cadres below raised the opinion that there was a shortage of labor and unfamiliarity with the technology, the leadership did not consider it. As a result, the plan fell through, causing dissatisfaction among cadres and the masses towards the Party. This problem also exists in the technical guidance of double-cropping rice. When sowing double-cropping rice, the leadership wanted to add more base ash according to foreign experience. At that time, the masses, especially experienced old farmers, raised many different opinions on this practice, but the leadership did not pay attention to studying these opinions based on local conditions. As a result, the emergence rate was not good, with the best reaching only about 70%, and the worst only 30% to 40%. If leading cadres are only willing to listen to good news and not willing to listen to bad news, they will also make grassroots cadres develop the bad habit of only reporting good news and not bad news. The branch secretary of Renyang Township in Changshu County told me that in the past, when he went to the district to attend meetings and report on his work, he was unwilling to talk about the problems existing in his work, because once when he raised some problems in his work in his report, he was criticized indiscriminately by the district party secretary; while the work of the neighboring township also had the same problems, but they only reported the good aspects of their work and were praised by the leadership.
    Therefore, as an ordinary Party member, I suggest that our Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels should quickly change this work style and listen to all kinds of feedback.

### 既要听“喜”也要听“忧”

专栏：党员来信

    既要听“喜”也要听“忧”
    编辑同志：
    善于倾听下级干部和广大群众的意见和反映，并且善于根据这些意见和反映改进自己的工作，是实现正确领导的基本条件之一。但是，从目前情况看，有些党组织和有些党的领导人员却不是这样。他们只喜欢听来自下面的“好”的反映，不喜欢听“坏”的反映。什么叫做“好”的反映，什么又叫做“坏”的反映呢？在这些党组织的负责同志看来，提出和领导意图不一致的看法和情况的，提出工作中的困难或消极的一面的，就是“坏”反映。否则就是“好”反映。每当他们听到所谓坏的反映的时候，就不加分析和研究，简单化的给以批评：“保守思想”“社会主义觉悟不高”等等。我们县里有一位负责同志在谈到基层干部报喜不报忧的不良作风的时候，曾公开地说：“我就喜欢听好的反映，不高兴听坏的反映，听见坏的，我就要批评。”也有的区委书记听到所谓好的汇报便笑逐颜开，听到别人谈工作中存在的问题就眉头一皱。当然工作中的缺点，工作中的困难都是不好的，但是，你堵上耳朵不听它，它并不会因此自行消灭，因为它是客观存在。正确的办法只能是正视客观存在的落后状态，同时加强自己的工作来改变这些落后状态。
    古话说：“兼听则明，偏听则暗。”又说：“旁观者清，当局者昏。”为什么“偏听则暗”？为什么“当局者昏”呢？正是不善于倾听别人的意见和不善于倾听来自各方面意见的结果。如果领导者处在“昏”“暗”的状态中，工作怎么能够作好呢？就拿今春推广双季稻的情况来说吧，不少地方的领导干部为了争取大量增产（双季稻是增产关键之一），做计划的时候就不顾主客观条件，盲目扩大双季稻面积。下面的干部虽然提出劳力不足和技术生疏的意见，领导方面却不加考虑。结果，计划落空，引起干部和群众对党的不满。在双季稻的技术指导上，也存在这个问题。播种双季稻时，领导方面根据外地经验要多加底灰，当时群众特别是有生产经验的老农对这种作法提出了很多不同的意见，领导方面却没有根据本地情况注意研究这些意见，结果出苗率不好，最好的才达到70％左右，最差的只有30％到40％。领导干部只愿听喜不愿听忧，还会使基层干部养成只愿报喜不愿报忧的不良作风。常熟县任阳乡的支部书记告诉我说，过去，他到区开会汇报工作是不肯谈工作上存在的问题的，因为，他有一次在汇报中提出了工作中的一些问题，就被区委书记不分青红皂白地批评了一顿；而邻乡的工作同样存在着问题，但他们只汇报了工作中的好的情况，就受到了领导上的表扬。
    因此，我以一个普通党员的身份，建议我们各级党组织和领导干部应该迅速改变这种作风，要听各种各样的反映。
