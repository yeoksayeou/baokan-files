    Delighted to Hear of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending
    Li Changzhi
    We have already seen the benefits of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom." So many good plays in various genres (with good plots, good performances, and good meanings, like "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in Kunqu opera) would have been buried if we hadn't "let a hundred flowers bloom"! After implementing this policy, we discovered just how rich and excellent our theatrical heritage is, and how many treasures it holds. The views of many who were previously hesitant have now been refuted by the facts. The facts have proven the correctness of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom"!
    Now, the explicit and emphatic proposal of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" will similarly prove to be a good and correct policy. I heard it and was filled with joy and excitement, so much so that I couldn't sleep! That's why I want to say a few words.
    The Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were an era of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend." Those who study cultural history and academic history all value that era. People say it was a golden age of Chinese scholarship! That's true, but it's not enough. Because that era was, after all, ancient, the cradle of Chinese culture. And, after all, it is only because later, in China's long feudal society, there were very few eras that could compare with that brilliant period that we say that. But it was certainly a good phenomenon in the academic world at the time. In the situation of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," each school was able to "hold on to its reasons and speak with logic," each school was able to "contend" and "speak out" with the completeness of its ideological system and the clarity of its problem statements, which gave later generations endless inspiration. Even now, although we cannot fully accept any one school, the works of each school will give us a fermentation of ideas when we come into contact with them, and that is good. We are completely different now from then. The Chinese people are engaged in a great socialist construction undertaking, unprecedented in history, that will shake the earth. We are now having another "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," and we will certainly "speak out" even better, giving even more abundant inspiration, and the brilliant achievements in culture will certainly be more solid, greater, and more fruitful! Therefore, I think this policy is excellent.
    I think that although the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" has only now been explicitly and emphatically proposed, this is naturally because there are now sufficient objective conditions. However, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has never had a policy contrary to this policy. On the contrary, it has always been in this direction. In the field of history, for example, after the People's Publishing House published Fan Wenlan's "A Brief History of China" a few years ago, it soon published Guo Moruo's "The Age of Slavery" and Shang Yue's "Outline of Chinese History." These books have differences in the periodization of Chinese history, but they were published all the same. The journal of the Academy of Sciences, "Historical Research," also regularly publishes debates on different views on the periodization of Chinese history. Isn't this a kind of "contending"? The problem is that the "speaking out" has not been loud enough, the number of people participating in the "speaking out" is not large enough, and the Central Committee has not been as clear and emphatic as it was with "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" in the theater sector. But there has never been a restriction on everyone "speaking out."
    Instead, some people have some self-created misunderstandings. Some of these misunderstandings come from refusing, or being unable, or being unaccustomed to independent thinking and independent research, and instead blindly believing in (truly blindly!) authority. There are true and false authorities, and even the true ones should not be blindly believed, but they blindly believe in all of them! There are large and small authorities, but they blindly believe in even small authorities! Authorities are of different natures, but they blindly believe in political authorities as academic authorities, and they blindly believe in authorities in one field of study as authorities in another field of study! Authorities are domestic and foreign. Either they blindly believe in domestic authorities because of a one-sided understanding of patriotism, or they blindly believe in foreign authorities because of a mechanical understanding of learning from advanced experiences. This still comes from good intentions. Some are simply watching the wind and blindly following. Since there are so many people watching the wind and blindly following, some people feel that "contending" is restricted. Another source of this misunderstanding is the individual comrades who hold administrative positions (especially in academic or teaching fields) or editing positions who want to save trouble. They are afraid of disputes, they are afraid that disputes will get out of control, they have not researched the issues themselves, but they are unwilling to give up interfering in things they do not understand, so they adopt a "the common saying is better" approach. They despise creative academic labor, and even suppress creative academic labor. They wait for themselves, they hope that others will wait, they hope that everyone will wait, and the result is a long wait. After waiting for a long time, some people misunderstand this as the policy. The two kinds of misunderstandings, plus a one-sided and simplistic view of protecting the Central Committee's lofty prestige, have created a trend: relying on the Central Committee to put forward certain views on an academic issue, and not being willing to use their own brains to think independently, or mistakenly believing that a certain authority represents the Central Committee's views on an academic issue, so everyone does not need to go to independent thinking and independent research. Of course, this trend has not bound the individual people who are seriously engaged in scientific research, but on the whole, it has produced a result: academic research cannot develop vigorously, academic research cannot keep up with the needs of national construction, and cannot meet the needs of the people's cultural life, and cannot meet the expectations of international friends when the motherland's international status is rising.
    This trend is of course not good and must be reversed. Now it is indeed beginning to reverse. This is enthusiastically welcomed by anyone who loves the motherland and loves academic research.
    But precisely because this trend is beginning to reverse, some people cannot help but be alarmed and suspicious, in short, they are a little unaccustomed to normal things. "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is certainly good, but what if there is "chaotic contention"? If materialism and idealism both have the freedom to promote their views, what if idealism is promoted on a large scale? Is the current proposal of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" because we are afraid that capitalist countries will say that we do not have "freedom of speech"? Is saying that idealism also has the freedom to promote its views a strategy to let idealists promote their views freely so that we can "rectify" them? If "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is carried out in universities, will it confuse students and leave them at a loss? If "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is carried out in higher normal schools, will it make it impossible for students to become middle school teachers? ...and so on.
    In my humble opinion, these concerns are unnecessary. First, this policy is being explicitly and emphatically proposed in a situation where China has already entered a socialist high tide, that is to say, in a situation where everyone already has a considerable level of socialist consciousness. At the same time, "contending" is based on serious academic research, so where will there be "chaotic contention"? Scholars themselves are unwilling to engage in "chaotic contention," and the broad masses of the people will not allow it either. As for idealism being promoted on a large scale, this is also unnecessary to worry about. Because: in today's world where the degree of socialist consciousness has been considerably raised, it is unimaginable that there are still people among the scholars who truly love the motherland and love science who deliberately promote idealism. There are now only two kinds of idealism that may exist: one is that they are subjectively willing to adopt the viewpoints of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, but because they have not mastered them well enough, they unconsciously still have some idealistic viewpoints; the other belongs to the scope of religious belief, not the scope of scientific work. The former needs "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" so that erroneous viewpoints can be corrected, and this kind of correction is also welcomed by those who originally had erroneous views. At the same time, only through criticism of erroneous viewpoints can correct viewpoints become more abundant, more in-depth, and more thorough. What's wrong with that? As for the latter, that is fundamentally not a matter of academic nature, and it is fundamentally not within the scope of the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend." On the one hand, freedom of belief is guaranteed by law, and on the other hand, the current academic world does not have the problem of fearing that religious beliefs will invade. Therefore, thinking that idealism will be promoted on a large scale is unnecessary worry. The problem now is how scientific research can advance by leaps and bounds through criticism and self-criticism, and how truth can become clearer and clearer through debate. It is not a matter of fearing that idealism will be promoted on a large scale.
    Second, "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is originally required by academic research itself, originally required by truth itself, and originally required by the process of cognition itself. As I understand it, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always required this of academic work. The emphasis on this policy now is only because it is necessary at present to ensure scientific research and promote the healthy development of scientific research; it is only because there are now more conditions and more necessity. How can it be said that it is because we are afraid of criticism from capitalist countries? Since this is a policy determined according to objective truth, it has a fairly long-term stability, so it is fundamentally not just for "rectifying" anyone.
    Third, within the scope of universities, universities are places for spreading truth, and places for conducting advanced scientific research. These all especially require arduous creative labor. "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" will not only not hinder these valuable labors, but will guarantee it, promote it, and develop it. Universities will not only not be outside the scope of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," but should be the most enthusiastic places for "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend." Saying that you are afraid that students will be confused and at a loss is too much of an underestimate of the abilities of today's university students, too much of a disregard for the scientific interests of today's university students, and too much of an ignorance of the cultivation of university students' independent thinking and independent working abilities. The fact is not so. As far as the university students I have come into contact with are concerned, they have a lot of discernment, and they often have a calm judgment on the debates in newspapers and periodicals; they also have scientific interests, and they often spontaneously organize scientific groups, and they are also very interested in participating in scientific discussion meetings. In order to develop their independent thinking ability and independent working ability, it is not a matter of not letting them know about various opinions, but of letting them be inspired and exercised in the comparison of various different opinions. In fact, it is impossible to curb this scientific interest and independent thinking ability of theirs. What is needed now is to guide them so that they can develop on a healthy path. "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in universities based on serious scientific research is the best way to set an example and guide them to develop on a healthy path. There is nothing to be afraid of. As for higher normal schools, I also don't see that they should have any differences of principle from comprehensive universities on this issue. Because, in higher normal schools, there is also a need for people who can think independently and work independently on problems, and there is also a need for people who are interested in and capable of scientific research. It is never hoped that they will become short-sighted people who only know how to stick to a middle school textbook and think that everything is fine. If this is the case, they will never be able to become a competent middle school teacher. Or some people are worried that if they also implement "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in middle schools, wouldn't it cause chaos? But this is again an underestimation of the judgment ability of our higher normal school students. Under normal circumstances, they will distinguish that the platform of middle school is different from the platform of university. In fact, the more the students' independent thinking ability and working ability are cultivated, the less likely they are to cause trouble in middle schools; on the contrary, if the opposite policy is adopted, making them develop mechanical obedience and narrow utilitarianism, more trouble will be caused.

    欣闻百家争鸣
    李长之
    “百花齐放”的好处，我们已经见到了。很多剧种中的好戏（情节好、表演好、意义好，像昆曲中“十五贯”那样的），如果不让“百花齐放”，我们就不知道要埋没多少！在执行这个方针以后，我们就发现原来我们的戏剧遗产是那样丰富，是那样优秀，是有那末多的宝藏。从前很多缩手缩脚的人的看法，现在不能不为事实所驳倒。事实已经证明“百花齐放”的正确！
    现在又明确地、着重地提出“百家争鸣”，这将同样证明是好的，正确的方针。我听了，欢欣鼓舞，喜而不寐！所以我要说几句话。
    春秋战国曾经是“百家争鸣”的时代。讲文化史、学术史的人都重视那个时代。人们说那是中国学术上的黄金时代呵！这话对，可是还不够。因为那个时代究竟是古代，究竟是中国文化的摇篮期，究竟是因为在中国长期封建社会中后来很少有和那个灿烂时代相比的时代才这样说的。然而总算是当时学术界的好现象。在“百家争鸣”的局面下，各家大都能“持之有故，言之成理”，各家大都能以思想体系上的完整性和对问题提出的明确性，在“争”，在“鸣”，这就给后人以无穷启发；就是到现在，我们虽然不能全盘接受某一家，但是每一家的著作都会让我们接触时在思想上发点酵，这就好。我们现在和那时完全不同了，中国人民正在从事从来还不曾有过的惊天动地的伟大社会主义建设事业，我们这时又来一个“百家争鸣”，我们一定“鸣”得更好，给人启发一定更丰富，文化上的灿烂成果也一定更坚实，更硕大，更丰收！所以，我觉得这个方针太好了。
    我这样想，“百家争鸣”的方针虽然在现在才明确地、着重地提出来，这自然是因为现在有充足的客观条件的原故，可是中共中央一向并不曾有和这个方针相反的方针，反之，倒一向就是在这个方向上的。以历史学范围以内来说，几年前人民出版社在出版了范文澜先生的“中国通史简编”之后，不久也就出版了郭沫若先生的“奴隶制时代”，尚钺先生的“中国历史纲要”，这些书对于中国历史的分期是存在着分歧的，但同样出版。科学院的刊物“历史研究”上也经常登载不同看法的有关中国历史分期的争论，这不是一种“争鸣”么？问题是，“鸣”得还不够响亮，参加“鸣”的人也不够多，中央也没有像在戏剧部门中提出的“百花齐放”那样明确、着重而已。可是从没有限制大家“鸣”。
    倒是有些人发生一些自造的误会。这误会有的是从不肯或不能或不习惯于独立思考、独立钻研而迷信（真是迷信！）权威来的。权威有真假，就是真的也不能迷信，但他们一律迷信！权威有大小，但他们对小权威也迷信！权威有不同性质，但他们把政治上的权威也当作为学术上的权威来迷信，把本来是这一门学术上的权威也当作那一门学术上的权威来迷信！权威有中外，或则因为片面理解爱国思想而迷信本国权威，或则因为机械地理解学习先进经验而迷信国外权威，这还是出自好意的，有的简直就是看风色，盲从了。看风色和盲从的人既多，就给某些人以限制“争鸣”的感觉。这误会还有一种来源，是由于担任行政工作（特别是学术或教学方面的）或编辑工作的个别同志图省事而起的。他们怕争论，他们怕争起来不可收拾，他们自己对问题也没有研究，但又不肯放弃对自己不懂得的事情的干涉，就采取一种“还是普通说法的好”的办法，他轻视创造性的学术劳动，甚而压制创造性的学术劳动，他自己等待，他希望别人等待，他希望大家都等待，结果是长期等待。等待既久，于是也被有些人误会为政策是如此。两种不同来源的误会加上对爱护中央崇高威信的片面简单看法，造成了这么一个风气：依赖中央对某一学术问题提出一定看法，而自己不愿动脑筋独立思考，或误认为某一权威就是代表中央对某一学术问题的看法的，大家便不必再去独立思考、独立钻研了。当然这个风气并没有束缚住个别认真从事科学研究的人，但就总的来讲，却产生了一个结果：学术不能蓬勃发展，学术赶不上国家建设的需要，也不能满足人民文化生活的需要，同时也不能符合在祖国国际地位日高的时候国际朋友对我们的期待。
    这个风气当然不好，当然必须扭转，现在就果然开始扭转了。这是任何热爱祖国和热爱学术的人所热烈欢迎的。
    可是正因为这个风气是开始扭转，某些人就不免有些大惊小怪，疑神疑鬼，总之是对正常的事反而有些不习惯了。“百家争鸣”固然好，“乱鸣”怎末办？唯物论和唯心论都有宣传的自由，如果唯心论大肆宣传怎末办？现在提出“百家争鸣”，是不是怕资本主义国家说我们“言论不自由”？说唯心论也有宣传自由，是不是一个策略，让唯心论者自由宣传一下，好“整”他们？大学里如果也“百家争鸣”起来，是不是会让学生莫衷一是，无所适从了？高等师范学校里如果也“百家争鸣”起来，是不是让学生没法当中学教师了？……等等。
    照我粗浅的想法，这些疑虑都是不必要的。第一，这个政策是在中国业已进入社会主义高潮，也就是说在大家业已具有相当社会主义觉悟水平的情况下明确而且着重地提出来的，同时“争鸣”是建筑在认真的学术研究的基础上的，哪里会“乱鸣”？“乱鸣”，学者们本身既不肯，也为广大群众所不许。至于唯心论会大肆宣传，这也同样是不必忧虑的。因为：在社会主义觉悟程度业已相当提高的今天，在真正爱祖国、爱科学的学者中间，如果还有人故意宣传唯心论，这是不可想像的事。现在可能存在的唯心论只有两种：一是主观上愿意采取辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义观点，但因为掌握得还不够或不好，于是不自觉地还带有某些唯心主义观点；二是属于宗教信仰范围，而不是科学工作范围的。对前者正是需要“百家争鸣”，错误的观点才能得到纠正，而这种纠正在原先有错误主张的人也是欢迎的，同时在正确的观点方面也只有经过对错误的批判才能更丰富、更深入、更周密，这有什么不好？至于后者，那根本不是学术性质的问题，也根本不在“百家争鸣”的政策范围之内，一方面信仰自由是有法律保障的，另方面现在的学术界也不存在怕宗教信仰来侵袭的问题。所以，认为唯心论会大肆宣传这种杞人忧天是不必要的。现在问题是，科学研究如何经过批评与自我批评向前大踏步推进，真理如何愈辩而愈明，根本不是怕什么唯心论大肆宣传等。
    第二，“百家争鸣”原是学术本身所要求的，原是真理本身所要求的，原是为认识过程本身所要求的。照我体会，中共中央对学术工作的要求也原是如此的。现在着重提出这个方针，只是因为在目前为保障科学研究、推进科学研究健康发展所必需；只是因为现在更有条件和更有必要而已，怎么能说是怕资本主义国家的批评？这既是根据客观真理而确定的方针，它有相当长期的稳固性，所以根本不是专为“整”什么人。
    第三，就大学范围内讲，大学是传播真理的地方，是进行高深科学研究的地方，这都特别需要艰巨的创造性的劳动，“百家争鸣”不但不会妨碍这些可贵的劳动，而是保障它，推动它，发展它。大学不但不会是“百家争鸣”的局外之地，倒应该是“百家争鸣”最热烈的地方。说怕学生莫衷一是，无所适从，这是太低估了现在大学生的能力了，也太漠视现在大学生的科学兴趣了，同时也太忽略培养大学生的独立思考、独立工作能力了。事实不是这样，就我所接触的大学生来说，他们很有辨别能力，他们对于报刊上的争论往往能有冷静的判断；他们也有科学兴趣，他们往往自动地组织科学小组，他们对参加科学讨论会也是有浓厚兴趣的。为了发展他们的独立思考能力、独立工作能力，不是不让他们知道各种说法，而是让他们在各种不同说法的比较中得到启发和锻炼。其实他们这种科学兴趣和独立思考能力，要遏止也是不可能的。现在需要的是加以指导，使其发展到健康的道路上去。在大学里建筑在认真的科学研究上的“百家争鸣”就是作出榜样，指导他们发展到健康道路上去的最好的方法。这没有什么可怕的。至于高等师范学校，我也看不出它和综合大学在这个问题上应该有什么原则上的分歧。因为，在高等师范学校，同样需要有对问题能够独立思考、独立工作的人，同样需要对科学研究有兴趣并有能力的人，决不希望他们成为目光如豆，只知道守着一本中学课本就认为万事大吉的人。如果这样，他们也决不能成为一个胜任的中学教师。或者还有人担心：如果他们到中学里也实行起“百家争鸣”来，岂不造成混乱么？然而这又是低估了我们高等师范学校学生的判断能力的话了。在正常的情形下，他们是会区别中学的讲台和大学的讲台是不同的。事实上倒是，越培养学生的独立思考能力、工作能力，他们到中学里越不会出乱子；反之，如果采取相反的方针，使他们养成机械的服从和狭隘的功利主义的话，出乱子倒会更多些。
