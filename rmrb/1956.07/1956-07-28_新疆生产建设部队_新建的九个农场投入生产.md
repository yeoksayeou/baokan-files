Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 27th. The Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is establishing new farms on more than one million mu of wasteland both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In the past six months, nine new farms have been built and put into production in the Manas River basin reclamation area and the Aksu reclamation area.

Most of the new farms are mainly focused on cotton production. Among them, the Anjihai Cotton Plantation Farm in the Manas River basin reclamation area, the largest cotton planting farm in the country, has been completed. This farm has a cultivated area of ​​more than 320,000 mu, of which 45,000 mu have already been put into production.

With the help of the Soviet expert working group of the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region is planning a farm on the nearly dried-up Boguxi Lake in the Korla area. It is the first farm in Xinjiang planned on land with a salt content of 24% or more.

While reclaiming wasteland and building farms, the troops have also solved the problem of water sources for irrigation of cultivated land. With the establishment of the Anjihai Cotton Plantation Farm and the farms in the Liugou reclamation area, several large reservoirs are under construction nearby, and the difficulty of insufficient snowmelt in the spring and the inability to irrigate in a timely manner will be fundamentally solved. This year, machines have been widely used in wasteland reclamation and farm construction in various reclamation areas. Plowing and harrowing have been fully mechanized, and large-scale land leveling projects have also used bulldozers.

    新建的九个农场投入生产
    新华社乌鲁木齐27日电　中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队正在天山南北一百多万亩荒原上建立新农场。半年多来，在玛纳斯河流域垦区和阿克苏垦区已有九个新农场建成投入生产。
    新建农场大部分是以棉作为主的。其中，全国最大植棉农场——玛纳斯河流域垦区的安集海植棉农场已经建成。这个农场耕地面积为三十二万多亩，其中四万五千亩已经投入生产。
    新疆军区农业生产建设部队在农垦部苏联专家工作组的帮助下，正在库尔勒专区快干涸的博古西湖进行一座农场的规划工作。它是新疆第一座在土质含盐量达24％以上的土地上规划的农场。
    部队在开荒建场的同时，都解决了耕地灌溉的水源问题。随着安集海植棉农场和柳沟垦区各农场的建立，农场附近几座大型水库正在建设中，春天雪水不足，不能及时灌溉的困难将得到根本解决。今年各垦区的开荒建场广泛使用了机器，犁地和耙地已全部机械化，大型平土工程也都使用了推土机。
