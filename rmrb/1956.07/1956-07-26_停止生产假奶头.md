    Stop Producing Artificial Nipples
    The rubber artificial nipples sold on the market are for children to suck on. Some children will stop crying as long as they have an artificial nipple in their mouths. However, these artificial nipples may transmit diseases and cause indigestion in children, which is detrimental to the health of infants. If air is sucked into the stomach, it can cause stomach pain and even affect the development of the infant's teeth and lips.
    Maternal and child health stations often advise mothers not to use artificial nipples to pacify their children, but not every mother understands this reason. If the relevant departments can stop producing or selling these artificial nipples, it will not only benefit infants but also allow this batch of rubber to be used where it is more needed.　Li Bingru

    停止生产假奶头
    市场上出卖的胶制假奶头，是给孩子含着玩的，有些孩子，只要嘴里含着个假奶头就不哭闹。但是这种假奶头可能会传染疾病和影响小孩消化不良，有碍婴儿健康；如果把空气吸到肚子里，还会肚子痛，甚至于影响婴儿的齿唇发育。
    妇幼保健站经常向母亲们宣传不要用假奶头哄孩子，但还不能使每一个母亲都能了解这个道理。如果有关部门能不生产或不出卖这种假奶头，不但对婴儿有好处，而且还可以把这批橡胶用到更需要的地方去。　李冰如
