　　Manifestation of the Will of the Japanese People

　　Which way should Japan go—the road of following the United States and rearmament, or the road of peace and independence? The major Japanese political parties are fiercely debating this issue. Now, the Japanese people have expressed their opinion through this House of Councillors election.

　　The conservative parties, led by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, openly stated during the campaign that they wanted to obtain more than two-thirds of the seats in the House of Councillors through this election, so as to amend the constitution, freely reorganize armaments, and continue to pursue a policy of following the United States in foreign affairs. However, the election results showed that the Liberal Democratic Party did not increase its seats. Not only could it not obtain a two-thirds majority in the House of Councillors, but it also failed to obtain a majority of seats. The Ryokufukai, which supported the Liberal Democratic Party, lost twelve of the seventeen seats being re-elected. Adding the seats won by these two parties to the senators who were not re-elected, they were still more than ten seats short of a two-thirds majority. Nobusuke Kishi, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, also admitted: "This defeat makes it difficult to amend (the constitution) in the next two or three years."

　　On the other hand, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Communist Party, and independent candidates, who clearly opposed amending the constitution and rearmament, demanded friendship between Japan and countries such as China and the Soviet Union, and advocated the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," achieved significant progress in the election despite various restrictions. The Socialist Party increased its seats by twelve compared to before the election, and the Communist Party also increased from one seat to two. Their common goal of having progressive forces obtain more than one-third of the seats in the House of Councillors to thwart the conservative parties' plan to amend the constitution has now been achieved with the support of voters.

　　The conservative parties in Japan invested a great deal of effort in this campaign. Starting at the beginning of this year, they deployed and launched a thorough and massive campaign, putting forward various reasons to defend their policies. Shortly before the vote, the Liberal Democratic Party also drafted a so-called "Ten Priority Policies," using promises such as "promoting peaceful diplomacy and international economic cooperation" and "enriching the social insurance system and promoting housing construction" to win votes. Tsuji Masanobu of the Liberal Democratic Party even fabricated the absurd rumor that "China and the Soviet Union provided donations to the (Japanese) Socialist Party," attempting to slander the reputation of Socialist Party candidates. In Tokyo, the Japanese police also searched the office of the Japan Communist Party to obstruct the election of Communist Party candidates. Japanese monopoly capitalist groups also gave strong support to the conservative parties. According to Kyodo News, Japanese business leaders had agreed on a principle: "Donate to the Liberal Democratic Party and the Ryokufukai, but not to the Socialist Party." At the same time, the United States also released information in early July saying that the United States would greatly increase its "aid" to Japan in 1957, attempting to "support the Japanese conservatives in the election campaign" ("The Japan Times").

　　However, despite this, some areas that have always been known as "conservative strongholds" also re-elected Socialist Party members this time. Although the Japanese police confiscated the "Akahata" special issue for the Communist Party candidate Masao Iwama's election campaign, the Japanese people still voted for him to be their representative. These facts show that the Japanese people's awareness is getting higher and higher, and the means used by the ruling parties to influence elections are becoming less and less effective. Now, more and more Japanese people are resolutely taking the broad road of peace and independence, and they firmly oppose taking the dangerous road of following the United States and rearmament.

　　The results of this Japanese House of Councillors election will undoubtedly have a very important impact on the future development of the Japanese political situation. Some people in the Japanese conservative parties have realized that the results of this election are a Japanese national "request for the Liberal Democratic Party to conduct deep self-reflection," but others are talking about the possibility of implementing the so-called "small constituency system" and strengthening "security countermeasures" to suppress and crack down on Japanese democratic forces. Obviously, the former group of people is more clear-headed, while the latter group has lost touch with reality and lacks due awareness of changes in the domestic and international situation in Japan. It can be said with certainty that the plan to suppress the Japanese democratic forces is bound to fail. However, this plan also shows that if the Japanese people want their expressed will to become a reality, they must raise their vigilance, strengthen unity, and continue to persist in the struggle for independence and the maintenance of peace.

### 日本人民意志的表现

    日本人民意志的表现
    日本应该向哪里走——走追随美国、重新武装的道路呢，还是走和平、独立的道路呢？日本各主要党派之间围绕着这个问题争论得很激烈。现在，日本人民通过这次参议院选举表示了他们的意见。
    以执政党自由民主党为首的保守党派在竞选过程中公开表示：它们要通过这次选举，在参议院取得三分之二以上的议席，以便今后修改宪法、放手重整军备，并在外交方面继续执行追随美国的政策。但是，选举的结果，自由民主党没有增加一席，不但不能在参议院取得三分之二的多数，而且也没有取得过半数席位。支持自由民主党的绿风会，在改选的十七席中丧失了十二席。这两个党派当选的席位加上未改选的参议员在一起，离三分之二的多数也还差十多席。自由民主党干事长岸信介也承认：“这一失败使得今后两三年修改（宪法）的事情困难了。”
    另一方面，在选举中明确地提出反对修改宪法和重新武装、要求日本同中苏等国友好、主张废除美日“安全条约”的日本社会党、日本共产党和独立人士，虽然受到了各种各样的限制，却取得了重大进展。社会党比选举前增加了十二席，共产党也由一席增加到了两席。它们提出的共同目标：使进步力量在参议院取得三分之一以上的议席来挫败保守党派修改宪法的计划，现在在选民的支持下已经实现了。
    日本保守党派在这次竞选中所花的力量是很大的。从今年年初开始，它们就布置和展开了周密的、庞大的竞选活动，提出了各式各样的理由来为它们的政策辩护。在投票前不久，自由民主党又拟出了一个所谓“十项重点政策”，用“推行和平外交和国际经济合作”、“充实社会保险制度和推进修建房屋”等诺言来争取选票。自由民主党的辻政信甚至无聊地制造出诬蔑“中国和苏联对（日本）社会党提供了捐款”的无稽谰言，企图诽谤社会党候选人的信誉。在东京，日本警察还搜查了日本共产党的办公处，以阻挠共产党候选人竞选。日本垄断资本集团也给保守党派以大力的支持。据共同社报道，日本实业界领导人曾商定一个原则：“向自由民主党和绿风会捐款，不向社会党捐款”。同时，美国也在七月初放出空气说，美国将在1957年度大大增加对日本的“援助”，企图以此来“在竞选运动中给日本保守党人以支持”（“日本时报”）。
    但是，尽管如此，某些一直被称为“保守派的黄金堡垒”的地区，这次也改选出了社会党议员。日本警察虽然把“赤旗报”为共产党候选人岩间正男竞选的专刊没收了，但日本人民还是投票选出了他为自己的代表。这些事实说明：日本人民的觉悟是越来越高了，执政党派所用的那些影响选举的手段，已经越来越不容易起作用了。现在，愈来愈多的日本人民毅然决然地要走和平、独立的康庄大道，他们坚决反对走追随美国、重新武装的危险道路。
    日本这次参议院选举的结果，对日本政局今后的发展无疑将发生很重要的影响。日本保守党派中的一些人，已经认识到这次选举的结果是日本国民“要求自由民主党作深刻反省”，但另一些人却在谈论他们可能要以实行所谓“小选举区制”和加强“治安对策”等办法来压制和打击日本的民主力量。显然，前一种人的头脑是比较清醒的，后一种人却丧失了现实感，对于日本国内外的局势的变化缺少应有的认识。可以肯定的说，压制日本民主力量的打算是必然要失败的。不过，这种打算也说明了：日本人民要使他们所表达的意志能够成为事实，还必须提高警惕，加强团结，继续为争取独立和维护和平而坚持斗争。
