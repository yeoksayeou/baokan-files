    Bigamy and Assaulting His Wife
    Tian Xuguang Sanctioned by Law
    (Our report) Tian Xuguang (Communist Party member), a staff member of the Trade Union of directly subordinate organs of the Ministry of Railways, has been sanctioned by state law for bigamy and assaulting his wife. The Xidan District People's Court of Beijing conducted a public sentencing on July 20th in the presence of more than a thousand spectators.
    Before completing the divorce procedures with his lover, Cao Fengying, Tian Xuguang used sweet words to deceive the nursery worker Liu Zuomin into marrying him. After the marriage, he implemented feudal rule over Liu Zuomin, and laid down "rules" such as "not allowed to look around while walking, and not allowed to greet men." At the same time, he also beat Liu Zuomin twice.
    Based on its investigation, the court held that Tian Xuguang's actions violated the Marriage Law and infringed upon human rights. Therefore, it sentenced Tian Xuguang to one year in prison, suspended for two years, in accordance with the law.

    重婚和打伤妻子
    田旭光受到法律制裁
    本报讯　铁道部直属机关工会工作人员田旭光（共产党员）重婚和打伤妻子，已受到国家法律的制裁。北京市西单区人民法院于七月二十日在一千多旁听群众的面前进行了公开宣判。
    田旭光在和他的爱人曹凤英还没有办完离婚手续的时候，又用甜言蜜语欺骗保育员刘作民和他结婚。婚后，又对刘作民实行封建统治，并给刘作民定出了“走路不许左顾右盼，不许和男人打招呼”等“清规”。同时还两次打伤刘作民。
    法院根据调查，认为田旭光的行为违犯了婚姻法，侵犯了人权，因此，依法判处田旭光徒刑一年，缓刑二年。
