Don't Let Workers Gaze at the Ocean and Sigh
    Kong Sang
    In some cotton textile factories in Qingdao, workers use "beyond reach" to describe the conditions for advanced producers set by the leadership. This is because the conditions are set too high and revised too quickly. Before the workers can catch up, the conditions change again. In the Songshu Silk Factory No. 3, a local state-owned enterprise in Fuxian County, Liaoning, the labor quotas are set high and change quickly, forcing workers to rush to meet them. It wasn't until the product quality declined because workers were rushing to meet the quotas that the leadership lowered the quotas.
    The conditions for advanced producers and labor quotas are both weapons to improve workers' enthusiasm for labor and increase labor efficiency. However, conditions and quotas that are too high and change too quickly can actually hinder the development of production. For example, in March, each weaving worker in Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 7 produced an average of 3.29 bolts of second-grade cloth, with an average advanced level of 1.77 bolts. In April, the conditions for advanced producers stipulated that no second-grade cloth should be produced. As a result, many workers felt that to become advanced producers, they could only "gaze at the ocean and sigh." As for the conditions changing too quickly, not only do the majority of employees "gaze at the ocean and sigh," but it also easily causes a large number of original advanced producers to "fall behind."
    Labor quotas that are set too high and change too quickly can easily lead to two undesirable outcomes. One is as Qi Yubin, a worker at Songshu Silk Factory No. 3, said: "I can never catch up, so I simply stop trying!" The other is to desperately chase after the quota, which increases the quantity but decreases the quality, resulting in waste. In enterprises that implement a piece-rate wage system, this can also easily lead to a large number of workers not receiving their basic wage because they cannot complete the quota, reducing their income and causing financial difficulties.
    It is also not good if the conditions for advanced producers and labor quotas are set too low and change too slowly. If they are too low, as some workers describe it, "you can complete it while sleeping," it will lose its role in promoting workers to learn and improve their skills. Labor quotas that are too low will lead to overspending on basic wages and increased product costs. Even if the conditions or quotas were originally very advanced, if they are not changed for a long time, they will eventually become backward and conservative.
    Labor quotas should be set according to the average advanced level of employees, which has long been a conclusion. Regarding the conditions for advanced producers, the "Resolution on Launching the Advanced Producer Movement" promulgated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also stipulates: Under the conditions of ensuring the completion of tasks and ensuring quality, as long as there are significant achievements in increasing quantity and quality, or in terms of saving, in terms of learning or mastering advanced experience and new technologies, in terms of improving equipment, improving operating methods, improving labor organization and safe production, and in terms of helping others, anyone with a special skill can become an advanced producer after being selected by the masses. The "Decision of the State Council on Wage Reform" mentioned that labor quotas are generally best revised once a year. The period for revising the conditions for advanced producers should also be conducive to consolidating and expanding the ranks of advanced producers. In this way, the majority of employees will not feel that becoming an advanced producer can only lead to "gazing at the ocean and sighing," but will strive to become an advanced producer with full confidence; they will also not feel that the labor quota is something to be "rushed after," but will believe that it can be pursued and are determined to catch up.

    莫让工人望洋兴叹
    孔桑
    在青岛的某些棉纺织厂里，工人们用“望尘莫及”来形容领导上制定的先进生产者条件。这是因为条件要求过高，修改得太快，还没等工人赶上来，条件又变了。在辽宁复县地方国营松树丝绸三厂里，劳动定额定得高，变得快，让工人紧赶紧追，直到产品质量因为工人赶定额而下降的时候，领导上才降低定额。
    先进生产者的条件和劳动定额，都是提高工人的劳动积极性、提高劳动效率的武器。然而，条件和定额太高，变得太快，反而不能推动生产的发展。例如青岛国棉七厂三月份每个织布工人平均出3.29匹二等布，平均先进水平是1.77匹，四月份的先进生产者条件就规定要不出二等布。这样一来，许多工人都认为要做先进生产者，只能“望洋兴叹”。至于条件变得太快，不仅广大职工“望洋兴叹”，而且容易使原有的先进生产者大批“掉队”。
    劳动定额定得太高，变得太快，很容易造成两种不良结果。一种如松树丝绸三厂的工人祁玉滨所说的：“老也赶不上，追不上，只好不赶不追！”另一种是拚命追，虽然数量增加了，但是质量下降了，形成浪费。在实行计件工资制的企业里，这还容易使大批工人因为完不成定额拿不到基本工资，减少收入，生活发生困难。
    先进生产者条件和劳动定额定得太低，变得太慢也不好。太低了，像有些工人所形容的那样：“睡大觉也能完成”，就会失去推动工人学习技术、提高技术的作用。劳动定额太低，就会使基本工资超支，产品成本提高。即使原来是很先进的条件或定额，老不改变，久而久之也会变成落后的和保守的。
    劳动定额应该按照职工的平均先进水平来定，这是早就有定论的。关于先进生产者的条件，中华全国总工会所公布的“关于开展先进生产者运动的决议”里也有规定：在保证完成任务和保证质量的条件下，只要在提高数量和质量上有显著成绩，或者在节约方面，在学习或掌握先进经验和新技术方面，在改进设备、改进操作方法，改进劳动组织和安全生产方面，在帮助别人等方面，有一技之长的，经过群众评选，都可以成为先进生产者。在“国务院关于工资改革的决定”中曾提到劳动定额一般以一年修改一次为好。关于修改先进生产者条件的期限，也应该以有利于巩固和扩大先进生产者队伍为宜。这样，广大职工就不会感到做先进生产者只能“望洋兴叹”，而将满怀信心地努力去争取做一个先进生产者；他们也将不会感到劳动定额是“紧赶紧追”的，而是认为可以追，并且有决心一定要追上去。
