    Watching a Dance Performance by Yugoslav Artists
    Zhao Feng

    During our performance tour in Yugoslavia, we watched a documentary film about Yugoslav folk dances called "Kolo." This film clearly explained that many dances originated from labor, derived from labor movements. The basic movements of one dance originated from people stepping on waterwheels, while another developed from the movements of people using their feet to polish copper plates. The former dance, even named "Suffering," narrates the hardship of people working to conquer nature. Besides labor, another motif of Yugoslav folk dance is war, the theme of war against foreign oppression. This type of "Kolo" depicting war narrates the battle between Yugoslav peasant uprising troops and Turkish invaders, from the discovery of the enemy's invasion until the entire team fought to the last man, with the movement of wielding swords evolving into bold and vigorous dance postures. Of course, Yugoslav folk dances also include various duets and group dances with love as the theme. This film left a deep impression on us. It not only allowed us to understand the origin, development, and techniques of Yugoslav folk dance, but also made us understand why the Yugoslav people love these dances so much. After many banquets, we almost always learned these beautiful dances together with our hosts, and whether they were old or young, they all danced so well. Many amateur dance and music groups perform dances with extremely high skills. What is even more unforgettable for us is that after many evenings of singing and dancing with Yugoslav friends past midnight, the hosts always sang and danced to a song called "Partisan Kolo," a song and dance widely popular among the Yugoslav people during the period of resisting fascist invaders. People recall those heroic and magnificent days from this song.

    While appreciating the dance performances of Yugoslav artists, I also constantly recalled everything mentioned above. The performances of Yugoslavia's most outstanding dancers and the creative methods displayed by their performances have given us great inspiration. As for Mila Sanina and Dušan Trninić, we also watched their performance of "The Legend of Ohrid" in Yugoslavia. This ballet, which can be called the Swan Lake of Yugoslavia, is a work by a contemporary composer, weaving the joys and sorrows of a pair of lovers into the events of the national liberation struggle, which has an extremely touching effect. Navenga Biotting and Ivica Sedici can be said to be two all-rounders. When they perform dances of different styles, it is also difficult for people to detect and distinguish. But in addition to their excellent art and technical level, I would like to particularly emphasize the characteristics of their creative expression methods, that is, their close combination of European classical ballet art and Yugoslav national dance art traditions. And this creative method is of great inspiration to us.

    We can see that they are not applying the movements and steps of European classical ballet without any change. At the same time, they are not merely stopping at treating folk dance as a "characteristic dance" (European ballet refers to ethnic dances with characteristics such as polka and Spanish dance as characteristic dances or character dances). In my opinion, they seem to cleverly combine the techniques of European classical ballet and the steps of folk dance. Especially the "Legend of Ohrid" mentioned earlier also follows this principle. I think this is different from the practice of interspersing some "characteristic dances" in ballet. Here, the choreography methods in many places are to simultaneously use the two techniques of European classical ballet and folk dance in the same solo, duet, or group dance, and apply these two dance postures, steps, movements, etc. as a method.

    If my understanding is correct, then the experience of our Yugoslav friends will be of great inspiration to us, and it is worth learning and referencing. And our Yugoslav guests have sacrificed their beautiful holidays and traveled a long way to perform for the people of our country, which is particularly worthy of our gratitude.

    看南斯拉夫艺术家的舞蹈表演   
    赵沨
    我们在南斯拉夫旅行演出时，曾经看过一个关于南斯拉夫人民的民间舞蹈的纪录电影，片名就叫“科罗”。这个电影清楚地叙明了：有许多舞蹈是从劳动中产生的，从劳动的动作衍化的。有一种舞蹈的基本动作是从人们用脚踏水车而衍化出来的，另一种是从人们用脚来磨光铜盘的动作发展出来的。前一种舞蹈，甚至名字就叫“苦”，是叙述人们为征服自然而劳动的艰苦的。除了劳动以外，另一个南斯拉夫人民民间舞蹈的母题是战争，是反对异族压迫的战争主题。这种描写战争的“科罗”，叙述了南斯拉夫农民起义队伍和土耳其入侵者之间的战斗，从发现敌人入侵直到全队战到仅余最后一人，把刀剑挥舞的动作衍变而为豪迈雄健的舞姿。当然，南斯拉夫民间舞蹈还有以爱情为主题的各种对舞和群舞。这个电影给我们很深刻的印象。不仅使我们了解了南斯拉夫的民间舞蹈的起源、发展和技巧，更使我们了解了为甚么南斯拉夫人民那么热爱这些舞蹈？我们在许多次的宴会后，差不多总要和主人们一起学习这些美丽的舞蹈，无论是老人或青年人，他们都舞得那么好。许多业余的舞蹈音乐团体，他们表演的舞蹈更有着极高的技巧。我们更为难忘的是，许多次和南斯拉夫的朋友在午夜后歌舞联欢的最后，主人们总要唱着和舞着一种叫“游击队科罗”的歌曲，这是南斯拉夫人民在反抗法西斯侵略者时期在人民中广泛流行的歌舞，人们从这个歌曲中，回忆着那些英勇、壮烈的日子。
    我在欣赏南斯拉夫艺术家们的舞蹈表演时，我也不时地回忆着上面所说的那一切。南斯拉夫最杰出的舞蹈家们的表演，和他们的演出节目所显示出来的那种创作方法，给予我们很大的启示。对于米拉·沙尼娜和杜生·特聂聂奇，我们在南斯拉夫时还看过他们表演的“奥赫里德传奇”，这个可以称之为南斯拉夫的天鹅湖的舞剧，是当代作曲家的作品，把一对爱人的离合悲欢交织在民族解放斗争的事件中，有着极为感人的效果。纳文加·别奥丁和伊维察·塞地奇，则可以说是两位全材，他们表演不同风格的舞蹈时，也使人不易觉察和分辨。但除了他们的优秀的艺术、技巧水平外，我愿意特别着重说他们的创作表现方法上的特色，那就是他们把欧洲古典舞剧艺术和南斯拉夫民族舞蹈艺术传统密切结合这一特点。而这种创作方法，对我们说来，是有着极大的启示的。
    我们可以看到，他们不是原封不动地应用欧洲古典舞剧的动作、步法的，同时，也不是仅仅停止在把民间舞蹈作为“特性舞”来处理（欧洲舞剧把具有特性的民族舞蹈如波尔卡、西班牙舞等称为特性舞或性格舞）。在我看，他们好像把欧洲古典舞剧的技巧和民间舞的步法等巧妙地揉合在一起了。特别是我们前面提到过的那个“奥赫里德传奇”，也是遵循着这个原则的。我认为，这种舞剧中穿插一些“特性舞”的做法有着不同。在这里，许多地方的编舞方法，则是在同一独舞、对舞或群舞中，同时运用欧洲古典舞剧和民间舞的两种技巧，把这两种舞姿、步法、动作等作为一种方法来应用。
    如果我这了解是对的，南斯拉夫的朋友们的经验对我们便将有着很大的启示作用，值得我们学习和参考。而我们的南斯拉夫的客人们牺牲了他们的美丽的假日远道跋踄来为我国人民演出，也就更特别值得我们表示感谢。
