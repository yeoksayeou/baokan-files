Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Alexandria Dispatch: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, in a speech yesterday, condemned the United States and Britain for rescinding their offer to help Egypt build the Aswan High Dam and announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company.

Abdel Nasser delivered the speech at a mass rally in Alexandria's Liberation Square, commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution. Twenty years ago, as a student, he was injured in this square during an anti-British demonstration.

He told the hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the square, "Four years ago, you expelled Farouk (the then-King of Egypt), and today, the canal has returned to Egypt." At this point, the crowd's enthusiasm reached its peak.

The Egyptian President said, "The Suez Canal will support the costs of the Aswan Dam, and more than adequately." He gave a hearty laugh as he said this.

Present at this grand gathering were Egyptian government officials, diplomatic representatives of Arab countries, and foreign delegations currently visiting Egypt, including the Chinese youth delegation.

Abdel Nasser said: “Today we enter the fifth year of the revolution. In the past four years, we have struggled to eliminate the remnants of foreign imperialism and domestic exploitation. We have triumphed in the struggle, and today we enter the fifth year with greater determination, more elite strength, and greater confidence.

"We will continue our victory and build a new nation that is truly independent politically and economically."

He said that the Western countries withdrew their offer to assist in the construction of the Aswan High Dam "in order to stop Egypt's struggle against military treaties and against imperialism." They are trying to "stop Egypt's efforts in favor of reconciliation, peaceful coexistence, and friendship among all peoples."

The Western countries attempted to "interfere in our country, but were thwarted by our independent policy." He also condemned imperialism's attempt to "incite the Sudanese against this high dam project."

Will Study Soviet Aid Proposals

Abdel Nasser said that Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, when proposing Soviet aid for the construction of the Aswan Dam, had told him that the Soviet Union would like to see good relations between Egypt and Western countries, so that international reconciliation could be improved. Shepilov had suggested that the Egyptian government avoid any actions that might lead to tension between Egypt on the one hand and Britain and the United States on the other. He added: That is why we accepted Western aid for the construction of the Aswan Dam.

The Egyptian President said that he had expressed his gratitude to Shepilov, but said that since negotiations with the World Bank regarding the Aswan Dam loan were still in progress, he would prefer to wait until his visit to Moscow in August to discuss the details of the Soviet proposal.

Imperialism Implements Economic Pressure

Abdel Nasser added: "Imperialism is attempting to use the Baghdad Pact to carry out a pincer movement against Egypt – a movement that has failed. Imperialism is now trying to exert economic pressure on Egypt."

"The Arab movement is defeating imperialism. The flames of Arab nationalism are burning from the Atlantic coast all the way to the Persian Gulf."

Abdel Nasser said that there was a "conspiracy" between the World Bank, Britain, and the United States to "lure" Egypt into starting construction of the Aswan High Dam. When construction was half completed, they would "impose conditions" that would affect Egypt's integrity and independence. "We have flatly rejected this trick."

Abdel Nasser said, "Without achieving economic independence, Egypt's political independence is unimaginable. We are ready to cooperate with everyone, but not at the expense of our glory and pan-Arabism."

He said that the Egyptian people used "blood, sweat, and tears" to force the British army to withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone.

When negotiating with Britain in 1953 regarding the British withdrawal from the Suez Canal Zone, Egypt rejected Britain's proposal to sign a 25-year alliance treaty. Britain's strategic withdrawal was completed last month.

The United States Attempts to Weaken the Egyptian Army

He said that Egypt had also rejected the US demand to sign a mutual security treaty as a condition for obtaining US arms.

Nasser asked: "Do you know what signing a mutual security treaty means?"

"It means that a US military delegation would control the Egyptian army, and General Abdel Hakim Amer (Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces) would not be able to interfere in army affairs. The imperialist countries aim to weaken the Egyptian army."

US Supports France in Massacring Algerians

He said: "The leader of the free world, the United States, is supporting France in massacring Algerians, but Arab nationalism has defeated France and its NATO allies in the past two years."

"The Algerians, with limited armaments, have defeated the NATO forces – these forces, established to deal with Russia, have been unable to stand their ground in Algeria."

Abdel Nasser also spoke about the "unconditional" arms trade between Egypt and Czechoslovakia, thereby breaking the Western "arms monopoly." He said, "After this transaction, Western countries clamored that they wanted to maintain a balance of power in the Middle East." At that time, the United States tried to lodge a strong protest against this arms trade.

US Diplomatic Pressure Hits a Wall

He said that the US official in charge in Cairo told him that US Assistant Secretary of State George Allen was coming to Cairo with a strongly worded letter from Secretary of State Dulles.

"I replied: 'If Allen utters a single insulting word, I will throw him out of my office.'

"Afterwards, US officials told me that Allen felt very embarrassed – if he handed Dulles' letter to me, I would throw him out of my office. But if he did not hand over the letter, Dulles would throw him out of Dulles' office."

He continued: "I reiterated that if he handed over Dulles' letter, I would throw him out of my office."

"Finally, Allen came and did not open his mouth. He simply listened to Egypt's views and briefly explained America's views."

Abdel Nasser's speech was repeatedly interrupted by cheers and applause from the crowd. Before he delivered the speech, people shouted "Down with treacherous imperialism" and "Long live the heroes of Bandung and Brioni."

When Cairo Radio broadcast the Egyptian President's announcement on the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, people cheered, jumped, hugged each other, and congratulated each other. Every restaurant and taxi with a radio was broadcasting the President's historic decision loudly.

### 纳赛尔总统发表演说  埃及奉行独立政策挫败了西方国家的干涉  将以更加坚定的信心建立真正独立的新国家

    纳赛尔总统发表演说
    埃及奉行独立政策挫败了西方国家的干涉
    将以更加坚定的信心建立真正独立的新国家
    新华社27日讯　亚历山大港消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔昨天在一篇演说中谴责美英撤销它们援助埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝的建议，并且宣布把国际苏彝士运河公司收归国有。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔是在亚历山大港解放广场一次纪念埃及革命四周年的大会上发表演说，二十年前当他还是一个学生的时候，他曾经在一次反英示威中在这个广场受过伤。
    他向聚集在广场上的几十万群众说，“四年前，你们驱逐了法鲁克（当时的埃及国王），今天，运河归还了埃及。”这时群众的热烈情绪达到了最高峰。
    埃及总统说，“苏彝士运河将支持阿斯旺水坝的费用，而且可以绰绰有余。”他说这句话的时候发出爽朗的笑声。
    出席这次盛大集会的有埃及政府官员、阿拉伯国家的外交代表和目前在埃及访问的外国代表团，其中包括中国青年代表团。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔说：“今天我们进入了革命的第五年。在过去四年中，我们进行了摆脱外国帝国主义和国内剥削的残余的斗争。我们在斗争中取得了胜利，今天我们以更加坚定的决心、更加精锐的实力、和更大的信心进入第五年。
      “我们将继续我们的胜利，并且建立一个在政治上和经济上真正独立的新国家。”
    他说，西方国家撤消它们援助建设阿斯旺高水坝的建议，“以便制止埃及进行的反对军事条约和反对帝国主义的斗争”。它们正在设法“制止埃及所进行的赞成各国人民之间的和解、和平共处和友谊的努力”。
    西方国家企图“干预我们的国家，但是却被我们的独立政策挫败了。”他还谴责了帝国主义企图“挑拨苏丹人反对这个高水坝工程”。
    将研究苏联援助建议
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔说，苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在建议苏联援助建设阿斯旺水坝的时候曾经告诉他，苏联愿意看到埃及和西方国家之间有很好的关系，这样国际和解就能够有所改进。谢皮洛夫曾建议埃及政府避免采取可能导致埃及一方跟英国和美国另一方之间的紧张状态的任何行动。他又说：这就是我们为什么接受西方援助建设阿斯旺水坝建议的原因。
    埃及总统说，他曾对谢皮洛夫表示感谢，但是说，由于同世界银行举行的关于阿斯旺水坝的贷款谈判还在进行，他愿意等到八月间他访问莫斯科的时候再讨论苏联建议的细节。
    帝国主义施行经济压力
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔又说：“帝国主义企图利用巴格达条约来对埃及进行一个钳形攻势运动——这个运动已经失败了。帝国主义现在企图对埃及施加经济压力”。
      “阿拉伯运动正在战胜帝国主义。阿拉伯民族主义的火焰正从大西洋海岸一直烧到波斯湾。”
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔说，世界银行，英国和美国之间有一项“共谋”，企图“诱骗”埃及开始建筑阿斯旺高水坝。在建设完成一半的时候，它们将“强加条件”，这些条件将影响埃及的完整和独立。“这种诡计我们已经干脆地加以拒绝了”。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔说，“不取得经济的独立，埃及的政治独立是不可想像的。我们准备同每一个人合作，但是不要牺牲我们的光荣和泛阿拉伯主义。”
    他说，埃及人是用“血、汗和眼泪”使英国军队从苏彝士运河区撤退的。
    埃及在1953年同英国谈判英国撤出苏彝士运河区问题的时候拒绝了英国提出的签订二十五年同盟条约的建议。英国的战略撤退已经在上月完成。
    美国企图削弱埃及军队
    他说，埃及还拒绝了美国要求签订共同安全条约作为获得美国军火的条件的要求。
    纳赛尔问道：“你们知道签订共同安全条约意味着什么呢？”
      “它意味着美国军事代表团控制埃及的军队，而阿卜杜勒·哈基姆·阿密尔少将（埃及武装部队总司令）将不能过问军队的问题。帝国主义国家的目的是要削弱埃及军队。”
  美支持法屠杀阿尔及利亚人
    他说：“自由世界的领袖美国在支持法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人，但是，阿拉伯的民族主义在过去两年战胜了法国和它的北大西洋公约组织的盟国。”
      “阿尔及利亚人以有限的军火打败了北大西洋公约组织部队——这些为了对付俄国而成立的部队在阿尔及利亚已经站不住脚了。”
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔还谈到埃及同捷克斯洛伐克进行的“不附带条件的”军火贸易，从而打破了西方的“军火垄断”。他说，“在这项交易以后，西方国家借口它们希望在中东保持武器均势而叫嚷起来。”当时美国曾经试图提出一项强烈抗议，反对这宗军火贸易。
    美国的外交压力碰壁
    他说，在开罗的美国负责当局告诉他说，美国助理国务卿乔治·艾伦带着国务卿杜勒斯的一封措词强硬的信前来开罗。
      “我答复说：‘如果艾伦说出一个侮辱性字眼，我就把他赶出我的办公室。’
      “之后，美国官员们对我说，艾伦感到很为难——如果他把杜勒斯的信交给我的话，我会把他赶出我的办公室。而如果他不把信交出的话，杜勒斯会把他赶出杜勒斯的办公室。”
    他接着说：“我又重申，如果他把杜勒斯的信交出的话，我将把他赶出我的办公室。”
      “最后，艾伦来了，并且没有开口。他只是倾听埃及的看法并简略地解释了美国的看法。”
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔的演说一再被群众的欢呼声和掌声所打断。在他发表演说之前，人们高呼“打倒背信弃义的帝国主义”、“万隆和布里俄尼的英雄万岁”。
    当开罗电台广播埃及总统关于把国际苏彝士运河公司收归国有的宣告时，人们都欢呼、跳跃、互相拥抱和互相道贺。每个装有收音机的餐馆和出租汽车都大声播送总统的这个历史性决定。
