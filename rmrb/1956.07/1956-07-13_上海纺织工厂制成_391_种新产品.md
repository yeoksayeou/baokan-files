Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 12th: Shanghai's cotton and wool textile factories have trial-produced 391 new varieties of products in the first half of this year, exceeding the annual new product trial production target by more than 30%.

　　A total of 208 new cotton textile products were successfully trial-produced in the first half of the year. These products have been successively test-marketed in 13 major cities across the country and have been widely welcomed. The various light-colored printed jacquard fabrics trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory and No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory were quickly snapped up in almost all test-marketing locations. The high-grade poplin woven from 80-count and 100-count cotton yarn by the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory is particularly popular among urban consumers. In addition, various light-colored khaki drills, crepe fabrics, double warp fabrics, horizontal satin, wide striped linen, and various seersucker fabrics with different patterns and elegant colors are also widely praised. Except for seersucker, which is out of season, other new varieties will continue to be produced in the third quarter.

　　Among the 183 new wool textile products, 134 have been assessed as qualified by the Ministry of Textile Industry, nearly half of which are fine worsted wool fabrics with good patterns and quality. The crimson and lake-blue fine worsted women's wear trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Wool Textile Factory looks like knitted fabric from a distance, which is beautiful and generous. The shimmering valitin from the No. 2 Wool Textile Factory and the checkered blankets from the No. 1 Wool Textile Factory have been praised by experts, and some have already received large orders from abroad. A total of 23 new yarn products for large-scale domestic consumption were trial-produced in the first half of the year, including fine and strong knitting yarn and eight-ply coarse yarn, which has not been produced for many years.

　　In the third quarter, cotton textile factories will continue to trial-produce 50 kinds of thicker and coarser cotton fabrics suitable for autumn and winter wear; wool textile factories also tentatively plan to trial-produce 42 new varieties in the second half of the year.

    上海纺织工厂制成391种新产品
    新华社上海12日电　上海的棉、毛纺织工厂，今年上半年试制了391种新的品种，超过全年新产品试制任务30％以上。
    上半年试制成功的新的棉纺织品共有208种。这些产品已经陆续在全国13个大城市中进行试销，普遍受到欢迎。国营上海第五棉纺织厂和第一印染厂试制的各种浅色印花提花布，几乎在所有的试销地都很快地被争购一空。第二棉纺织厂用八十支和一百支棉纱织成的高级府绸，特别受城市消费者的欢迎。此外，受到普遍赞赏的还有各种浅色卡其布、绉纹布、双经布、横贡缎、宽条麻纱，以及各种不同花纹、色泽素雅的泡泡纱等。除了泡泡纱因为穿用时令已过以外，其他新品种第三季度都要继续生产。
    在183种新的毛纺织品当中，已经经过纺织工业部评定合格的有134种，其中将近半数是花色和质量都很好的精纺毛织品。国营上海第三毛纺织厂试制的西红、湖色等精纺女式呢，远看很像编结织物，美观而大方；第二毛纺织厂的闪光凡立丁、第一毛纺织厂的格子毛毯等，都受到专家们的赞赏，有的已经接到国外大批定货。大量供应国内消费的绒线新产品，上半年共试制出23种。其中有细而牢的针织绒线，也有多年没有生产过的八股粗绒线。
    第三季度，棉纺织厂要继续试制50种适合秋冬季穿的较厚、较粗的棉织品；毛纺织厂也初步打算在下半年再试制42种新的品种。
