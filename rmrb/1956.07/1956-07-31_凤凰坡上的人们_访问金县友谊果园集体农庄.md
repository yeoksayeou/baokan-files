    People on Phoenix Slope – Visiting the Jin County Friendship Orchard Collective Farm
    By Our Special Correspondent, Xiao Qian

      I. A Sea of Green
    The old man who pointed me to the office of the farm chairman was right to ask: why didn't you come earlier, why didn't you come later, why did you pick this time to visit? Now, even the white flowers of the latest-blooming Guoguang apples have withered, and the earliest-ripening cherries in the farm are still green, the same color as the leaves from a distance.
    Despite this, the old man enthusiastically pointed with his tobacco pipe: This is hawthorn, that is apricot, and that low-lying area is Taibai peach. The fruit on the apple trees all over the mountain is only the size of beans - it should be said, just the size of mung beans, but in the eyes of the old villagers, they are already big, red, and round apples with international status. They are not hanging on the branches, but packed in boxes, marked with export stamps.
    "Each of these trees is our money tree! One ton of apples shipped out can be exchanged for two tons of steel. Last year, our Bali Village alone exchanged for more than a thousand tons of steel. But when the 'high tide' came at the end of the year, Qili Village and Heping Village also joined in. The farm expanded from more than one hundred households to more than eight hundred households, with one hundred thousand fruit trees. You figure it out, how many tons of steel can be exchanged?"
    After he finished speaking, he stared at me, as if seriously waiting for an answer. As for me, after his guidance, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe towards those endless, neatly arranged fruit trees on the terraced fields on both sides of the road. The early summer sun plated a layer of gold on the lush treetops, and the breeze from the Bohai Sea blew in gusts. People and nature pinned infinite hopes on these money trees.
    That huge wedge embedded in the blue sky is the famous Dahe Shang Mountain. Below the mountain, just as the farm's "Villager's Song" describes: "On the high Phoenix Slope, apples are like a sea of green." In the sea of green, there are spots of bright colors appearing and disappearing, these are the female villagers climbing up and down among the trees, pruning the excess fruit. The square buildings on the mountain are the team headquarters of the production teams.
    It looks very quiet, but it is actually a very tense world! The production team members of the field team are pulling fertilizers to the fields cart after cart, and the young herdsmen are driving the cattle up the mountain. The thin, sharp neighing of horses occasionally rises in the air, trembling like silk and bamboo, and then slowly falls into the valley. In the gully, some team members are carrying water, and some are carrying soil. Every villager is working hard at their post.
    The small western-style building on the hillside is the farm chairman's office. Half of the second floor is a terrace, which looks like the high-arched command tower on a ship from a distance. There are two huge sycamore trees guarding the gate below the hillside, the trees are full of trumpet-shaped lotus-colored flowers, emitting fragrance. When I think of the Friendship Farm, I think of those two sycamore trees. Beautiful trees, standing at the foot of the mountain.
    June 14th of this year marked the third anniversary of the farm's founding. In this period, the development of the farm's cause has been considerable; even more considerable is the growth of the villagers under the socialist education of the farm.

      II. Red Little Expert
    In the summer of 1953, when Ma Wanfeng had just graduated from Bali Village Primary School, he didn't want to go to the farm like his father to engage in agriculture. He was determined to go to the Jinzhou Textile Factory to "join the glorious working class." It wasn't until he couldn't get into the Jinzhou Textile Factory that he dragged his heels and went to the farm with a pout. But he didn't make a fuss for long. His father was a party member and the model production team leader. Zhao Futian, the captain of the fourth team who directly led him at the time, had high skills and was willing to teach others. And when the young man was in the fifth grade and studying natural science, sitting in the classroom, his little brain had also turned over such an idea: How good it would be to learn from the Soviet Union's Michurin: to make trees listen to people, and let everyone eat delicious fruits.
    His family had been growing fruit trees for four generations. During the period of mutual aid teams, his father had two hundred fruit trees. He often watched his father grafting, and he would inevitably take care of them himself. After entering the farm, he did some rough work during the day, and at night he gnawed on some pamphlets about Michurin's theory under the kerosene lamp.
    In the past, the team members had never heard of the name "Michurin." During breaks, Ma Wanfeng sat on the ground and started talking. He told them that this Soviet old man could make the same plant bear tomatoes on top and potatoes on the bottom, saying that Michurin's densely planted pear trees could bear three hundred fruits per tree, while we plant them so sparsely, we only get about one hundred.
    Ma Wanfeng first grafted peaches, which are easier to graft, and then learned to graft apples, pears, and cherries. The more he grafted, the more excited he became, and the bolder he became. In half a year, he learned the techniques of grafting, budding, inserting, and pruning. The "King" apples he tried to graft according to Michurin's method were indeed much sweeter.
    Ma Wanfeng learned a lesson from growing fruit trees: fruit trees are like people, they must be carefully cultivated from a young age, and you can't be careless for a moment. If you fool it, it will fool you in the fruit it bears.
    Two major events happened in Ma Wanfeng's life the year before last: he joined the Youth League on August 1st, and then he was transferred to the cattle farm to become a herdsman. With this transfer, he had to learn from scratch again. But there was one thing he didn't have to learn from scratch. As soon as he walked into the cowshed, he knew: cows are like fruit trees, they must be carefully cultivated from a young age, and you can't be careless for a moment. If you fool it, it will fool you in the milk production.
    So, he went to graze the cattle all over the mountain during the day, and at night he studied books like "Practical Cattle Raising." Whenever he saw agricultural school students from other places interning, he would go to them to ask for knowledge of feeding management. But the most important thing was his meticulous observation of the cattle. Some herdsmen only want a place to rest themselves, regardless of whether the grass there is good or bad. Ma Wanfeng would rather stand in the sun. He thought of ways to make the cows eat good grass. Some cows are willing to drink leftover water, and some are only willing to drink fresh water. He would let those cows with "cleanliness" drink first. He never hit a cow. He knew that if you hit them, the milk would dry up. Once, a calf fell on the hillside and was about to roll to the bottom of the mountain. He rushed over desperately and helped the calf up. The calf refused to eat fodder, so Ma Wanfeng helped it lie down on the grass and gently rubbed it.
    Two months after arriving at the cattle farm, Ma Wanfeng did something that surprised many villagers: he delivered the calf of the brown-grey No. 5 cow.
    Dairy cows are not like yellow cows. The calves of yellow cows weigh only thirty or forty pounds, but the calves of dairy cows are bigger and cannot be raised without human help. Looking at the mother cow lying on the ground and wailing in pain, how could this little herdsman not be nervous? The farm's property worth thousands of yuan - the lives of the big and small cows - were all in his hands. What if... He disinfected his hands, rolled up his sleeves, and muttered to himself, beads of sweat dripping down. Although he had said strong words beforehand, it was still time to retreat - the captain, holding the medicine, squatted next to him.
    "Go ahead, it's nothing!" The captain encouraged the young man in a low voice, afraid that he would lose heart.
    At this time, Ma Wanfeng was also thinking: What if the captain isn't home in the future and a cow gives birth to a calf? Then I'll be at a loss. No, I must learn this skill.
    When that newborn black and white calf pressed its hot body against him, looked around curiously, and affectionately licked the back of his hand, his strenuous labor was greatly rewarded.
    After that, Ma Wanfeng delivered two more calves. He also learned to identify the quality of cows, often walking around the cows with a small notebook, scoring the cows' limbs separately.
    Last year, as soon as the draft military service law was announced, this little herdsman became uneasy again. He believed that he should immediately become a glorious national defense soldier. His view obviously differed somewhat from the view of the farm's established "Military Service Evaluation Committee," which believed that he was under age and could not be considered. Ma Wanfeng argued with the committee, his thick neck red and veins bulging, saying that he was a Tiger, anyway.
    "Young man, it's not enough to be a Tiger, you have to be eighteen years old."
    After returning home, he took the household registration booklet out of the drawer. Looking at the crooked little words: "Birthday: December 16th," he became more and more angry. His little eyes rolled, he picked up a pen and crossed out the "ten" in the month and changed the "two" to a "six." He thought he had done something extremely clever. The young man didn't expect that the evaluation committee also had his details. In the end, it was the farm's Youth League secretary who helped him solve this problem: The country will be conscripting soldiers every year in the future. If you're not old enough this year, won't you be old enough next year?
    The day I went to the team headquarters to visit Ma Wanfeng, this red little expert in black uniform was curling up one leg, talking to the cadres sent by the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry to understand the animal husbandry situation on the heated brick bed in the inner room. On the wall hung a watercolor painting by Lin Maoxiong: "The Herd in the Commune." A watch hung on the nail of the monthly calendar, and several pairs of rubber boots were placed under the table. On the table in the outer room were rows of milk bottles, next to a weighing scale. Milk is squeezed three times a day, and in addition to the villagers, there are also workers from the nearby troops and chemical plants who subscribe to it.
    He led me to visit the clean cowshed and the warehouse filled with bran. When talking about grafting and talking about cows, Ma Wanfeng never stopped. Only when asked, "Do you have a girlfriend?" this young villager was dumbfounded.
    "Tell me, it's not like you're talking to an outsider," the Youth League secretary who came with me coaxed.
    Ma Wanfeng blushed, lowered his head, and secretly raised his smiling eyes, looking towards the other side of the mountain. Turning around, he grabbed a handful of grass and slipped to the side of a Dutch cow. The cow desperately wagged its tail at him, expressing its deep friendship.
    I went over and asked Ma Wanfeng, "Is she also on the cattle farm team?" He shook his head while feeding the grass into the cow's mouth, "No, she's in the fourth production team." The cow's nostrils puffed like bellows, chewing vigorously. I asked again, "Are you getting engaged this year?" He shook his head firmly at me. "No, I'll join the army first."
    At this time, a clear chime sounded in the valley. It was eleven o'clock, and the female villagers were getting off work early to go home and cook. Some women carried baskets, some carried hoe handles, walking along the way in twos and threes, talking and laughing. Their colorful headscarves and clothes decorated the hillside with bright and dazzling colors. (To be continued)

    凤凰坡上的人们——访问金县友谊果园集体农庄
    本报特约记者　萧乾
      一、绿色的海洋
    指给我到农庄主席办公室路的那位老大爷问得有道理：怎么早不来，晚不来，单单挑这时候来访问呢？现在，连开花最晚的国光苹果的白色花朵也谢了，农庄上果子熟得顶早的樱桃又还绿着，从远处望去，跟枝叶一个颜色。
    尽管这样，这位老大爷还是举着他手里的烟袋锅子，热情地向我指点着：这是山楂，那是杏子，那片矮的是太白桃。满山的苹果树上结的果实刚有豆子大——应该说，刚有绿豆大，可是在老庄员的眼里，它们就已经是又红又圆，有国际地位的大苹果了，它们不是挂在树枝上，而是装了箱，打上出口印记的。
    “这一棵棵都是俺们的摇钱树！运出一吨苹果，就换进两吨钢。去年光俺们八里村一个村，就换回一千多吨钢。可是年底‘高潮’一来，七里村、和平村也加入进来了。农庄由一百多户扩大到八百多户，果树有十万多棵，你核计核计，该能换回多少吨钢？”
    他说完定睛望着我，就好像认真等着个答案。我呢，经他这么一指点，对公路两旁层层梯田上，那些一眼望不到边的、排列齐整的果树，心里不禁也肃然起敬了。初夏的太阳在蓊郁的叶梢上镀了一层金色，渤海的和风一阵阵吹拂着，人们和大自然对这些摇钱树都寄托了无限的期望。
    嵌进蓝天里的那个巨大的楔子就是有名的大和尚山。山下面，正像这个农庄的“庄员之歌”里描绘的：“在那高高的凤凰山坡上，苹果像一片绿色的海洋。”绿色的海洋里有点点鲜艳的颜色在倏隐倏现，这是女庄员们正在树丛间爬上爬下，剪着多余的果实。山上那些方形的建筑物是生产队的队部。
    看起来满幽静，其实这是个非常紧张的世界！田间队的生产队员，一车车地把肥料往地里拉，小饲养员正赶着牛群上山。空中偶尔扬起马的尖细的嘶鸣声，颤巍巍的像丝竹，然后又徐徐落到山坳里。山沟里队员们有的正挑水，有的在抬土，每个庄员都在自己的岗位上辛勤地劳动着。
    半山坡上那幢小洋楼就是农庄主席的办公室，二楼上面一半是座露台，远看很像是轮船上高拱的指挥塔。山坡下面有两棵硕大的梧桐，把着大门，满树都开着喇叭形的藕荷色花朵，散放着芬香。一想到友谊农庄，我就想到那两棵梧桐。美丽的树，屹立在山脚下。
    今年六月十四那天，农庄就满了三周岁。在这段日子里，农庄事业上的发展是可观的；更可观的，是在农庄的社会主义教育下成长着的庄员们。
    二、红色小专家
    1953年夏天，麻万丰刚从八里庄小学毕业出来的时候，他并不想跟他爹一样进农庄来搞农业，他一心想到金州纺织厂去“参加光荣的工人阶级”。一直到金州纺织厂怎么也进不成的时候，他才拖着脚后跟，噘着嘴巴进的农庄。可是他并没闹多久情绪。他爹是个党员、范模生产组长，当时直接领导他的第四队队长赵福田技术高，又肯教人，而小伙子在五年级念自然课的时候，坐在课室里小脑瓜儿也曾经转过这样的念头：学苏联的米丘林多好：叫树木听人的话，让大家吃到可口的水果。
    他家四辈子都是种果树的。搞互助组的时期，他爹有两百棵果树，他常看着他爹接枝，自己短不了也侍弄侍弄。进了农庄，他白天干些粗鲁活儿，晚上就在煤油灯底下啃一些讲米丘林学说的小册子。
    以前，队员们没听说过“米丘林”这个名字。休息的时候，麻万丰坐在地里就扯开了。他告诉他们这个苏联老头儿能叫同一棵植物上头结西红柿，下头结土豆，说米丘林密植的梨树，一棵能结三百个，咱们种得这么稀，才结上一百个。
    麻万丰先接比较好接的桃子，以后又学着接苹果、梨、樱桃。越接他兴致越高，胆子也越壮。半年工夫他就学会了接、粘、插、剪的技术。他根据米丘林的方法试接的“大王”苹果，味道确实是甜多了。
    麻万丰从搞果树上头学到一个教训：果树也像人，从小就得好好培养，一会儿也马虎不得。你要是哄弄它，它就会在结果儿上头哄弄你。
    前年麻万丰的生活里发生了两件大事：他在八月一日那天入了团，随后，调到养牛队来，当上饲养员。这么一调，他又得从头学起了。可是有一样他不用从头学，他一走进牛房就晓得：牛也像果树，从小就得好好培养，一会儿也马虎不得。你要是哄弄它，它就会在产奶上头哄弄你。
    于是，他白天满山去放牛，晚上抱着“实用养牛学”一类的书来琢磨。一见到外地来实习的农校学生，他就凑过去向他们讨教饲养管理的知识。但是最主要的还是他对牛无微不至的体贴观察。有的饲养员只要自己有个歇脚的地方，就不管那里的草好坏。麻万丰宁可站着挨晒，他想遍了法儿叫牛吃到好草。有的牛肯喝剩水，有的只肯喝新鲜水。他就让那些有“洁癖”的牛先喝。他从来没打过牛一下，他晓得一打，奶就乏了。有一回一只小牛在山坡上跌倒了，眼看就要滚到山底下去。他不顾命地奔过去，把小牛扶了起来。小牛不肯吃草料了，麻万丰就把它扶倒在草地上，轻轻替它搓揉。
    到牛房两个月，麻万丰干了一件叫许多庄员都吃惊的事：他给棕灰色的五号牛接了生。
    奶牛不比黄牛，黄牛的崽子不过三、四十斤重，奶牛的崽子就大了，非靠人帮助，养不出来。望着躺在地上沉痛地哀叫着的母牛，这个小饲养员怎么不紧张呢。农庄上几千块钱的财产——大牛小牛的命全在他手里，万一……他消完了毒，一面挽着袖口，一面心里嘀咕着，一串串的汗珠子往下掉。尽管自己事先说下了硬话，现在还来得及撤腿呢——手里拿着药品的队长，就蹲在他旁边。
      “接吧，没啥的！”队长怕小伙子泄气，小声给他撑着腰。
    这时候，麻万丰心里也想：万一将来遇到队长不在家，牛下了崽呢？那时候可抓瞎了。不，非学会这套本事不可。
    当那头新生的黑白花牛崽子用滚热的身子贴着他，好奇地朝四下里望着，亲嫟地舔着他的手背的时候，他的一阵紧张的劳动得到了极大的报偿。
    那以后，又有两头小牛是麻万丰接的。他还学会了鉴别牛的质量，时常拿个小本本围着牛转，给牛的四肢分别划着分数。
    去年兵役法草案一公布，这个小饲养员又不安心了。他认为他应该立即成为一名光荣的国防战士。他这个看法显然跟农庄成立的“兵役评议委员会”的看法有些出入，他们认为他不足年龄，不能考虑。麻万丰粗脖子红筋地跟委员会争辩，说他反正是属虎的。
      “小伙子，光属虎不行，得满十八周岁。”
    回家以后，他把户口本子从抽屉里拿出来。望着那行歪歪拧拧的小字：“生日：十二月十六日”，他越想越生气。小眼珠子一转，他抄起笔来，把月份上的“十”字涂掉，把“二”字改作“六”字。他以为是干了件绝顶聪明的事，小伙子没料到评议委员会手里也有他的底细。最后，还是农庄的团支书帮他解决了这个难题：以后国家年年要征兵了。今年不足岁，明年不就足岁了吗。
    我到队部访问麻万丰那天，这个穿了黑制服的红色小专家正蜷着一条腿，在里屋炕上跟农林局派来了解畜牧情况的干部谈话哪。墙上挂着一幅林茂雄的水彩画：“社里的牛群”，月份牌的钉子上挂着一只手表，桌底下摆着几双胶皮靴。外屋桌上放着一排排的奶瓶子，旁边有个磅秤。牛奶一天挤三回，订户除了庄员，还有驻在左近的部队和化工厂的工人。
    他领我参观了收拾得干干净净的牛房和堆满了麸子的仓库。谈起接枝，谈起牛来，麻万丰都没个完。单单问起他：“有对象了吗？”的时候，这个小庄员就哑住了。
    “说吧，不是外人，”同来的团支书怂恿着。
    麻万丰红着脸，低下头去，又偷偷抬起笑眯着的眼睛，望着山那边。一转身，抓了把草溜到一头荷兰牛的身旁去了。牛拚命朝他摆着尾巴，对他表示着深厚的友谊。
    我凑过去问麻万丰：“她也是养牛队的吗？”他一面把草送到牛嘴里，一面摇头说，“不，是第四生产队的。”牛的鼻孔像风箱那么呼哧呼哧地响，起劲地嚼着。我又问：“今年订婚吗？”他望着我坚决地摇了摇头。“不，参上军再说。”
    这时候，山谷里敲起一阵清脆的罄声。十一点了，女庄员们提前下班，回家做饭去了。有的妇女挎着篮子，有的扛着锄把，一路上三三两两，说说笑笑的。她们那五颜六色的头巾和衣裳在山坡上点缀出鲜艳夺目的光彩。　（待续）
