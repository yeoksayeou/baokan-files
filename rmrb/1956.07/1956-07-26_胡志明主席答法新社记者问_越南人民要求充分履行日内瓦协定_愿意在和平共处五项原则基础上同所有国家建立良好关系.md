Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 25th. Hanoi newspapers today published Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's replies to questions posed by an Agence France-Presse reporter.

Regarding the question of who is responsible for the failure to hold the general election in Vietnam on schedule, Ho Chi Minh said that clearly, the American imperialist interventionists and the pro-American regime in South Vietnam bear the primary responsibility for this situation. France, as a signatory to the agreement, also bears some responsibility.

Ho Chi Minh said that the Geneva Accords cannot lose their validity for any reason whatsoever. With the broad support of peace-loving and democratic governments and peoples around the world, our entire people, from north to south, are determined to fight for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords.

In response to the question of whether the Vietnamese government is willing to recognize the liaison delegation of South Vietnam to the International Commission that may appear in Hanoi, and whether it is willing to recognize the South Vietnamese representatives in the Joint Commission, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: We are ready to do so at any time on the basis of the terms of the Geneva Accords. Regarding the question of whether there will be new contact between the people of North and South Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh said that our government has repeatedly suggested to the Southern regime that people should be free to travel between the two regions. Until now, we have not received a reply. At present, no consultations have been held on this issue.

The Agence France-Presse reporter asked whether the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to hold an election in the North to re-elect the National Assembly elected in 1946.

Ho Chi Minh's reply to this question was: We are in favor of holding free general elections nationwide in accordance with the Geneva Accords to achieve the reunification of the motherland.

Finally, in response to the question of whether the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with countries outside the socialist camp, Ho Chi Minh said that our foreign policy is: to establish good relations with all countries willing to establish diplomatic relations with us on the basis of reciprocity, equality, and respect for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    胡志明主席答法新社记者问
    越南人民要求充分履行日内瓦协定
    愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同所有国家建立良好关系
    新华社河内25日电　今天的河内报纸发表了越南民主共和国主席胡志明对法新社记者所提问题的答复。
    关于谁对越南的普选不能按期实现负责的问题，胡志明说，显然，美帝国主义干涉者和越南南方的亲美政权，要对这种情况负主要责任。法国是签订协定的一方，也负有部分责任。
    胡志明说，日内瓦协定不可能因为任何一个理由而失去效力。在世界上爱好和平和民主的各国政府和人民的广泛支持下，我们从北到南的全体人民，坚决为要求充分履行日内瓦协定而斗争。
    在回答越南政府是否愿意承认可能在河内出现的越南南方驻国际委员会联络代表团和是否愿意承认联合委员会中的越南南方代表的时候，胡志明主席说：在日内瓦协定条款的基础上，我们随时准备这样做。关于越南北南两方人民是否有新的接触的问题，胡志明说，我们政府曾多次向南方政权建议让人民在两个地区间自由往来，直到现在，我们没有得到回答。目前，关于这个问题没有举行任何协商。
    法新社记者问，越南民主共和国是否准备在北方举行一次选举，以改选1946年所选出的国会。
    胡志明对这个问题的答复是：我们赞成正确地按照日内瓦协定，在全国范围内举行自由普选，以实现祖国的统一。
    最后，胡志明在答复越南民主共和国政府是否准备与社会主义阵营以外的国家建立外交关系的问题的时候说，我们的对外政策是：在有来有往、平等和尊重和平共处五项原则的基础上，和所有愿意同我们建立外交关系的国家建立良好关系。
