    After returning to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant from their internships in the Soviet Union, the interns are actively helping employees master automobile production technology.

    Over a hundred of the existing foremen have interned in the Soviet Union. Now, these individuals have become mentors to the workers in various workshops.

    Forging workshop foremen Wang Zhibao and three others, after returning to the factory, have helped seventy or eighty workers learn machine operation techniques and assisted more than ten adjusters in independently carrying out more complex adjustment work.

    Process engineer Ren Quan of the chassis workshop, a 1953 university graduate, after returning to the factory, led and helped employees overcome many technical difficulties. On the eve of the pilot production line's trial, more than ten key issues that had remained unresolved for half a year were left. Ren Quan, together with other engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers, formed a "task force" to "attack" each machine tool one by one. In less than two weeks, these problems were all resolved.

    Every workshop and functional department of the First Automobile Plant has a group of professional engineering and technical personnel who have interned in the Soviet Union. They give workers technical theory lessons and teach them how to operate machinery, becoming the backbone for spreading advanced Soviet technology. The factory also has a large number of demobilized cadres and worker-turned-cadres who interned in the Soviet Union in production organization and management. These cadres also made great contributions to equipment installation, production adjustment, and trial production.

    从苏联回来以后
    据新华社讯　第一汽车制造厂留苏回厂的实习生们，积极地帮助职工掌握汽车生产技术。
    现有的工长当中，有一百多名曾经在苏联实习过。现在这些人已经成了各车间工人们的师傅。
    锻工车间王治宝等四名工长，回厂以后已经帮助七、八十名工人学会了机器操作技术，并且帮助十多名调整工独立进行较复杂的调整工作。
    底盘车间工艺师任荃，是1953年毕业的大学生。他回厂以后，领导和帮助职工克服了许多技术上的困难。这个车间在流水试生产的前夕，遗留下十多个半年都没有得到解决的关键问题。任荃同别的工程技术人员、技术工人组成“课题突击队”到机床旁边一个一个地“突击”，不到两周的时间，就把这些问题都解决了。
    第一汽车厂各个车间和职能部门，都有一批在苏联实习过的专业工程技术人员。他们给工人上技术理论课，教工人操作，成了传播苏联先进技术的骨干。这个厂还有大批在苏联实习过生产组织管理的转业干部和工人出身的干部。这些干部在设备安装、调整生产和试生产当中也都作了很大的贡献。
