The rooster's eyes are on its nose

Liu Shiping

This story isn't some fantastical anecdote; it's a true story. Bai Guizhen, a female worker in the spray painting team at the Beijing Enamel Factory, told me an interesting episode about spraying rooster patterns on enamel washbasins. In the past, when they sprayed a rooster on a washbasin, they would either spray the eyes on the nose or the nose on the mouth. When a washbasin was sprayed like this, it had to be brushed off and resprayed because it didn't meet the specifications. They just couldn't get it right. Strange! Was it destined that the rooster's eyes would grow on its nose?

What was going on? Was the rooster stencil engraved incorrectly, or were the spray painters misaligning the stencil? No one could figure out where the problem was. But the spray painting team leader was very angry, gesticulating wildly, as if he were the only one who knew where the problem was. He asserted that the spray painters weren't aligning the stencil correctly. When Bai Guizhen was spray painting, she tried her best to align the stencil, but the rooster's eyes stubbornly grew on its nose.

Later, Bai Guizhen and some other comrades were sent to the Shanghai Huafeng Enamel Factory to study for more than two months. While in Shanghai, they visited other enamel factories and compared their own sprayed washbasins with those of others, and only then did they uncover the truth: their stencils were engraved incorrectly.

After they returned from Shanghai, they raised the issue with the team leader, requesting that the stencil engraving work be improved. Readers! What do you think happened? The team leader should have changed his mind, right? No, this team leader still said that the fault lay with the workers.

In order to improve the quality of its products, the Enamel Factory invited Master Pan Zhiwen, a senior worker from the Shanghai Huafeng Enamel Factory with more than 20 years of spray painting experience, to be the spray painting team leader. After being in the spray painting workshop for only a few days, this Master Pan discovered that the rooster stencil was engraved incorrectly, the center was off, so the rooster's eyes were sprayed on its nose. Pan Zhiwen studied with the workers and helped the stencil engravers find the center. They adopted the rosin glue engraving method to reduce the expansion and contraction of the stencil; at the same time, they improved the spray painting technique. In the past, out of 500 washbasins sprayed in a day, 40 to 50 had to be brushed off; now, only one or two are unqualified. The qualification rate of the washbasins has increased from 65% in the past to 99.8%; at the same time, the output has also doubled. In the past, only about 500 were sprayed a day; after improving the stencil engraving and spray painting techniques, because there was less rework, more than 1,000 could be sprayed a day. They are not satisfied with this and have not only improved the quality of the batch of washbasins leaving the factory in July, but also improved the variety of colors and designs.

    公鸡的眼睛长在鼻子上
    刘时平
    这个故事，并不是什么虚幻的奇闻，是真事。白桂珍是北京搪瓷厂喷花班的女工，她曾告诉我一个在搪瓷脸盆上喷公鸡图样的有趣的插曲。过去他们在脸盆上喷一个公鸡，不是把眼睛喷在鼻子上，就是把鼻子喷在嘴上，喷出一个脸盆来，因为不合规格，又得刷掉，重新喷，总是喷不对头。奇怪！难道注定公鸡的眼睛要长在鼻子上吗？
    是怎么回事呢？公鸡版子刻的不对头，还是喷花工人对不准版子走了样。谁也找不出毛病在哪里。可是喷花班长大为生气，指手划脚，好像只有他一个人知道毛病在哪里。他一口肯定：喷花工人没有把版子对准。白桂珍在喷花时，用尽心机对版子，公鸡的眼睛还是顽强地长在鼻子上。
    后来，白桂珍和其他一些同志被派到上海华丰搪瓷厂去学习了两个多月。在上海的时候，他们参观了其他的搪瓷厂，把自己喷的脸盆和人家比较了一下，才揭开了真相，原来是他们的版子刻的不对头。
    他们从上海回来以后，就向班长提出意见，要求改进刻版工作。读者们！你们想会怎样？班长总该回心转意了吧？不，这个班长还是说过错在工人身上。
    搪瓷厂为了改进产品的质量，又从上海华丰搪瓷厂请来一位老师傅潘志文作喷花班长。这位老师傅干了二十多年的喷花工作，他到喷花车间没有几天，就发现喷公鸡的版子刻的不正确，中心不对，因此公鸡的眼睛就喷在鼻子上了。潘志文和工人在一起研究，帮助刻版工人把中心找出来。采用了松香胶刻版的方法，使版子的伸缩性减少；同时改进了喷花技术。过去喷出来的脸盆，一天喷五百个要刷去四、五十个，现在一天不过只有一两个不合格。脸盆的合格率从过去的65％，提高到99.8％；同时产量也增加了一倍。过去一天只喷五百来个，改进刻版和喷花技术后，因为返工少，一天可以喷一千多个。他们并不以此为满足，在七月份出厂的一批脸盆，不但提高了质量，同时改进了花色品种。（附图片）
