    Random Thoughts on Sketching in Hunan and Guangxi, Part 3
    The Scenery of Yangshuo
    Hu Peihang
    Although the city walls of Yangshuo County are no longer standing, the quaint and interesting city gate still stands alone. The streets are not wide, and the residents are very simple. Mr. Shuai Chujian, a local Chinese painter, said: There is a line in an ancient poem, "Tao Qian of Pengze had five willow trees, Pan Yue of Heyang had a county of flowers, both places contend to be as good as Yangshuo, where people live among the peaks of Green Lotus," after reading this seven-character quatrain, one can understand that the scenery of Yangshuo is very different from other places. He introduced the "Eight Views of Yangshuo" as: Bai Sha Fishing Lights, Dongling Morning Glow, West Mountain Evening Glow, City Bridge Twin Moons, Ma Shan Mountain Air, Dragon Cave Immortal Spring, Jian Temple Monk Bell, and Honggong Ten Thousand Clouds.

    The Yangshuo Park in the county town has two white mountain pavilions, which look very beautiful in the middle of the green mountains and trees. The park is planted with hundreds of tall sweet osmanthus trees, it is said that when they bloom, the whole county can be scented. The Bilian Peak in the city, like a cone, is covered with evergreen shrubs, which are extraordinarily beautiful when they bloom. There is a road on the mountain that can reach the summit. We walked past a temple and saw a small building by the stream, specially for painters to sketch. Each side of the building has rectangular windows, and the view from the window becomes a natural rectangular painting frame, which is a very interesting studio. (Attached picture)

    湘桂写生随感之三
    阳朔风景
    胡佩衡
    阳朔县城，虽然城墙已不存在，可是古拙有趣的城门仍然独存。街道不宽，居民非常朴素。当地国画家帅础坚先生说：古诗中有“陶潜彭泽五株柳，潘岳河阳一县花，两地争如阳朔好，碧莲峰里住人家”之句，读了这首七绝，就可以了解阳朔风景与别处大有不同了。他介绍“阳朔八景”是：白沙渔火，东岭朝霞，西山晚照，市桥双月，马山岚气，龙洞仙泉，鉴寺僧钟，黉宫万云。
    县城的阳朔公园，有两个白色山亭，在青山碧树的中间，显得十分美丽。公园中满植一丈以上的丹桂数百株，据说开花时全县都能熏香。市内碧莲峰，如圆锥形，四面满生常青的灌木，开花时奇丽异常，山有路可登，能到绝顶。我们走过一座寺院，见溪边有一座小楼，专供画家们写生用的，楼的各面有长方窗子，由窗口外望，便成天然的长方画幅，这倒是很有趣的画室。（附图片）
