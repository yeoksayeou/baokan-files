Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd Dispatch from Moscow: According to TASS, the Japanese Ambassador to London, Nishimura Haruhiko, handed a statement from the Japanese government to the Soviet Ambassador Malik on July 18th, requesting him to forward it to the Soviet government.

The Japanese government's statement said that the Japanese government is prepared to resume the negotiations held in London in the past by representatives of the two countries to normalize relations between the two countries. The Japanese government has decided to send Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, who bears important responsibility for Japan's international relations, to Moscow as the Japanese plenipotentiary representative for negotiations. Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu will participate in the negotiations together with Shunichi Matsumoto, who previously served as the plenipotentiary representative in London.

The list of personnel in the delegation led by the Foreign Minister and their route will be notified to the Soviet government immediately after the decision on this issue is accepted.

It is now requested that, in order to conduct negotiations, diplomatic privileges be granted to Mamoru Shigemitsu and the members of the delegation he leads, and that they be provided with various assistance, including the use of ciphers.

The Soviet government has already replied to the Japanese government on July 21st through the Soviet Ambassador to London, stating that the Soviet government is prepared to resume the aforementioned negotiations and has appointed Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitry Shepilov as the plenipotentiary representative.

The Soviet government will receive the Japanese government delegation headed by Mamoru Shigemitsu in Moscow and will guarantee the necessary working conditions, including granting diplomatic privileges, using ciphers, and other conveniences.

In its reply, the Soviet Union suggested that the negotiations should preferably begin on the date stipulated in the Soviet-Japanese Communiqué of May 14, 1956. The communiqué on the results of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on fishing issues and the rescue of persons in distress at sea on May 14th stipulated that the resumption of negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations must be no later than July 31, 1956.

    苏日两国商谈恢复谈判问题
    苏联任命谢皮洛夫为全权代表
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：日本驻伦敦大使西春彦七月十八日把日本政府的一篇声明交给苏联大使马立克，请他转交苏联政府。
    日本政府的声明说，日本政府准备恢复两国代表过去在伦敦举行的使两国关系正常化的谈判。日本政府决定派遣对日本的国际关系负有重要责任的外务相重光葵先生作为日本全权代表到莫斯科进行谈判。外务相重光葵先生将同过去作为全权代表在伦敦谈判的松木俊一先生共同参加谈判。
    外务相所率领的代表团人员名单和他们前往的路线，在就这个问题作出的决定被接受之后，立刻就通知苏联政府。
    现在要求，为了进行谈判，请给予重光葵先生和他率领的代表团团员以外交特权，并且对他们作种种协助，包括使用密码。
    苏联政府已经在七月二十一日通过苏联驻伦敦大使答复日本政府说，苏联政府准备恢复上述谈判，并且任命苏联外交部长德米特里·谢皮洛夫为全权代表。
    苏联政府将在莫斯科接待以重光葵先生为首的日本政府代表团，并且将保证给予工作上的必要条件，包括给予外交特权，使用密码和其他种种方便。
    苏联在答复中建议：谈判最好是在1956年5月14日苏日公报中所规定的日期开始。五月十四日的苏联和日本关于捕鱼问题和援救海上遇难者问题的谈判结果公报曾经规定，关于苏日关系正常化问题的谈判的恢复，必须不迟于1956年7月31日。
