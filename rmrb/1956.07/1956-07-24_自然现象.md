    “Natural Phenomenon”
    The teaching building of the Second Junior Middle School in Handan City, Hebei Province, was built with a national investment of 54,400 yuan. This teaching building has a reinforced concrete structure and is designed beautifully. However, on the fifth day after its completion, cracks began to appear everywhere, especially on both sides of the reinforced concrete beams, where large cracks, about seven meters long, two millimeters wide, and four centimeters deep, appeared.
    The school sent someone to question the construction unit—Handan City Construction Engineering Bureau. Engineer Zhu of this bureau gave the following explanation: The cracks in the building are not a big problem, they will only shorten the life of the building a bit. ... Wasn't there also cracking in the building of our engineering office right after it was built? ... Be calm, don't be impatient, this is a "natural phenomenon." According to Engineer Zhu's statement, it seems that all new buildings should have cracks. Comrades, please judge, is this statement reasonable?

    “自然现象”
    河北省邯郸市第二初级中学的教学大楼，是国家投资五万四千四百多元盖成的。这座教学大楼是钢筋混凝土结构，设计得也还漂亮。可是刚刚建成后的第五天就普遍开始裂缝，尤其是在钢筋混凝土大梁的两侧，竟裂出长约七公尺、宽达二公厘、深约四公分的大缝来。
    学校派人去质问承建单位——邯郸市建筑工程局，这个局的朱工程师竟作了如下的解释：大楼裂缝，并不是什么大问题，只不过使大楼寿命缩短一些罢了。……我们工程处的大楼不是也刚刚盖好就裂缝吗？……要冷静，不要沉不住气，这是“自然现象”。按照朱工程师的说法，好像所有新建大楼都应该裂缝。请同志们评评，这种说法合理吗？
