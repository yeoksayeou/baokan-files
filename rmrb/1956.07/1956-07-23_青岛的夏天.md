Qingdao's Summer
A Well-Deserved Reputation as a Summer Resort

Summer, when the heat is stifling, Qingdao, a beautiful city described as having "azure seas, verdant hills, lush forests, red tiles, neither cold nor hot, navigable by boat and car," becomes particularly lovely.

International dignitaries, students from friendly nations, representatives of various ethnic groups from within China, and working people from all over the country are flocking to Qingdao. Last year, two to three hundred thousand people came to visit, escape the heat, or recuperate, and this year the city is preparing to welcome even more guests.

The bathing beaches have been expanded again this year. A sanatorium specifically for Chinese scientists has been newly built. This spring, the city planted 600,000 new trees, and there are no longer any bare, treeless roads in the urban area. Buildings of all styles are surrounded by layers of greenery, with only the red rooftops visible from a distance. Opening the windows of buildings along the coast offers a view of fishing boats and warships at sea. Not only do the sea breezes chase away the heat from the land in the mornings and evenings, but even at the hottest time of day, people do not experience the dry, sultry feeling associated with a continental climate. Therefore, Qingdao's coastline becomes the liveliest place in summer. In the middle of the coastline is a 420-meter-long pier, like an arm extending straight into the sea from the shore, which is crowded with thousands of people enjoying the cool air every evening after dinner.

On July 12th, the First Congress of the Communist Party of China Shandong Provincial Committee grandly opened in Qingdao. On the 13th, the first eye-catching new event of the Shandong Provincial First Children's Games – a children's mini-soccer tournament – also began here. The children are actively preparing for the National Children's Games, which will also be held here in August.

Ma Sicong, China's famous violinist, has also come to Qingdao, and music lovers are eagerly purchasing concert tickets to hear him play Chinese folk music and works by world-renowned musicians.

The unique and pleasant summer life of the people in Qingdao has begun.

Evening in the Street Parks

More than a dozen street parks are scattered throughout the city, adding to the charm of this city already known as a large seaside park. Not only do people who live near the street parks love these places of rest, but passersby can also sit on the wooden chairs and stone benches at any time.

The Sixth Street Park on Anhui Road is crowded with visitors every evening. Workers, citizens, and office staff who live near the park, having finished their day's work, some accompany their loved ones, chatting on the grass, while others leisurely stroll with their children. One side of the park is dedicated to children's play, and laughter constantly echoes from around the slides and seesaws. Little girls who love to sing and dance are also singing and dancing. On the other side of the park, a group of people are closely gathered around a person playing the huqin, listening to him skillfully perform various beautiful melodies. A lively little girl told the reporter: "My home is right next to the park. Inside the door is my dormitory, and outside the door is the park. It's a really good life!" But this innocent little girl doesn't know that before liberation, this was a large, dirty pit filled with garbage.

Currently, more than 140 horticultural workers throughout the city have thoroughly cleared the weeds in the parks to welcome guests from all over who come to visit and escape the summer heat. The hedges in the street parks have been freshly trimmed, and some parks have even added street lights. At night, the lights illuminate the cedars, junipers, flowers, trees, and lawns, making the street parks extraordinarily beautiful and inviting.

Secluded Sanatorium Area

West from Huiquan Bathing Beach, east to Fushan, south from the seaside, and north to Zhan Shan and Taiping Mountain, on this lush hillside lies Qingdao's famous sanatorium area. This is a scenic, beautiful, and the most secluded place in Qingdao. Many labor models, workers, experts, writers, professors, and state personnel from all over the country come here to recuperate and rest.

In the morning, after exercising, people in the sanatorium always like to climb to high places to look out at the rising sun over the sea and the ships leaving port. In the evening, some stroll along the clean roads, some fish on the rocks by the sea, and some pick up colorful pebbles washed up by the sea, or look for beautiful "sea chrysanthemums." (Note)

This year, to create a more comfortable environment for those who come to recuperate, the state has allocated funds to add recreation rooms, dance halls, libraries, and gardens.

Note: This is a type of green mollusk that grows on rocks by the sea. Its countless white tentacles spread out in the water like blooming chrysanthemums.

Joyful Bathing Beaches

As it enters mid-July, the number of people swimming in the sea is increasing day by day. These days, the bathing beaches attract tens of thousands of people every day.

At the city's largest First Bathing Beach, which can accommodate more than 50,000 people, on Sundays and factory holidays, the sea surface is filled with dense crowds. People lying or sitting on the beach sunbathing look like a large brown carpet, covering the sandy beach. When you pass by, you have to be extra careful, like a child learning to walk, otherwise you might step on someone.

Sailors often become demonstrators of diving at the bathing beach; many skilled swimmers have become volunteer coaches, helping and guiding novices to learn freestyle and breaststroke swimming. Groups of children and people learning to swim embrace the brown lifebuoys and float freely with the waves. Just listen to the laughter of the sun-tanned girls and young men, and look at the contented smiles of the elderly people running out of the sea and lying on the sand, and you will deeply understand why people regard jumping into the sea for a swim as the most satisfying enjoyment in the summer.

This year, the state has allocated nearly 400,000 yuan to renovate and construct Qingdao's bathing beaches. In the next two to three months, it will be possible to receive more swimming enthusiasts than last year (more than 700,000 visitors). The actual area of the renovated First Bathing Beach has been expanded by one-sixth compared to last year, and the men's and women's changing rooms have been expanded to 7,825 square meters. The safety equipment that people are most concerned about - the shark nets - have been repaired with new oiled palm rope; and this year, two new fast rescue boats have been added.

Sailing Club

On July 14th, the Qingdao Sailing Club started its classes.

This summer, more than 7,000 young men and women will participate in sailing activities here, which is more than in any previous year.

This sailing club is an amateur mass organization dedicated to helping young people learn sailing knowledge and exercise their bodies. State personnel, workers, shop assistants, students, and citizens who are interested in sailing can go to the sailing club to learn swimming, rowing, sailing, maritime communication, operating motorboats, making ship models, and other sailing knowledge and skills. In the past two or three years, the sailing club has trained more than 12,000 students, and some have become experts in sailing sports.

Summer Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

Qingdao's service industries have also made proper arrangements for people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the summer. According to statistics from the city's largest state-owned department store, the First Department Store, up to the beginning of July, it had expanded its business to 13,434 types of goods. The 124 new styles of suitable summer clothing, including a variety of new styles of swimwear, were especially popular with customers. The state-owned trading company specially sent people to Shanghai and other places twice to purchase more than 300 new commodities, including the nationally famous Jinhua ham, Baita butter, mackerel roe, various Su (zhou) pastries, and Western pastries. Various pastry processing factories have also recently restored and trial-produced 32 new types of pastries.

In order to adapt to the characteristics of people's activities in summer, supply booths selling non-staple foods, cold foods, and newspapers and periodicals have been newly established along the coast and at the trestle. Many mobile supply stalls have also been added at the First Bathing Beach and Zhongshan Park, so that visitors and swimmers can buy snacks and fruits at any time.

In terms of urban transportation, the Railway Bureau began increasing five pairs of suburban trains from June 1st. In addition to increasing the original shuttle buses from Zhongshan Road to Huiquan, the city's public buses have also opened two new special lines from Dongzhen and Xizhen to the bathing beaches, and the full fare has been reduced by 20%. The state-owned Welfare Company is also actively preparing to renovate new hotels in the Taixi District.

    青岛的夏天
    避暑胜地名不虚传
    夏天，暑气逼人的时候，青岛这座被人描绘作：“碧海、青山、绿林、红瓦、不寒不暑、可舟可车”的美丽的城市，就显得特别可爱了。
    国际贵宾、友邦的留学生、国内各兄弟民族的代表，全国各地的劳动人民，正陆续涌向青岛。去年有二、三十万人前来游览、避暑或疗养，今年这里准备迎接更多的客人。
    今年又扩建了海水浴场。新建了专为接待中国科学家们的疗养院。春天全市新栽了六十万株树木，市区内再也找不到两旁光秃无树的马路了。各式的楼房被绿荫层层包围，远处只能看到那红色的屋顶。打开滨海一带楼房的窗门，即可眺望海上的渔船和军舰。不但早晨、夜晚海风会驱走陆上的暑气，就是中午最热的时候，人们也不会有呼吸在大陆性气候里的那种干燥、闷热的感觉。所以青岛市的海滨，就变成夏天最热闹的地方了。海滨中段有座四百二十公尺长的栈桥，像一只手臂，从海岸直伸向海中，每天晚饭以后，栈桥周围便拥满了成千上万乘凉的人。
    七月十二日，中共山东省第一次代表大会在青岛隆重开幕了。十三日，山东全省第一届少年儿童运动员大会的第一个引人注意的新项目——儿童小足球赛，也在这里开始了。孩子们正为八月间还要在此举行的全国少年儿童运动员大会，积极地展开了准备活动。
    我国著名的小提琴家马思聪也来到了青岛，音乐爱好者正争购演奏会的票券，去听他演奏中国民间乐曲和世界著名音乐家们的作品。
    在青岛的人们的别有风味的愉快的暑期生活开始了。街心公园的傍晚
    十几处街心公园散布在市区，使这座被称为海滨大公园的城市如同锦上添花。不光靠近街心公园居住的人们喜爱这些休憩场所；行人也可以随时到街心公园的木椅、石凳上坐坐。
    安徽路第六街心公园里，每天傍晚都聚满了游人。公园附近的工人、市民和机关工作人员结束了一天的劳动，有的陪伴着爱人在草地上谈心；有的拉着孩子悠闲地散步。公园的一边还专为孩子们开辟了游戏的场所，从滑梯和跷板周围，时时传来孩子们嬉戏的欢笑声；爱歌爱舞的小姑娘们也在唱歌和舞蹈。公园的另一边一群人密密地围拢在一个拉胡琴的人的四周，倾听他熟练地演奏各种优美的调子。一位活泼的小姑娘对记者说：“俺的家，紧靠公园，进门是宿舍，出门是公园，真是好生活啦。”但是，这个天真的小姑娘，那能知道在解放前这里还是个堆满垃圾的大脏坑呢。
    目前全市一百四十多个园艺工人，为了迎接夏天各地来游览、避暑的客人，把公园里的杂草早已清除得一干二净，街心公园的绿篱，又新剪了一遍，有的公园还增设了路灯。夜晚，灯光照耀着雪松、塔柏、花木、草坪，使街心公园分外的美丽诱人。
    幽静的疗养区
    西从汇泉浴场，东到浮山，南起海滨，北至湛山、太平山，在这个一片葱绿的半山坡上，就是青岛著名的疗养区。这是个山明水秀、风景优美、青岛市区最幽静的地方。来自全国各地的许多劳动模范、工人、专家、作家、教授和国家工作人员，就在这里疗养和休息。
    早晨，疗养的人们作完了体操，总喜欢到高处眺望海上初升的太阳和出海的船只；傍晚，有的在洁净的马路上散步，有的在海边的岩石上钓鱼，有的在挑选海水冲来的多彩的石子，或寻找美丽的“海菊花”。（注）
    今年，为了给前来疗养的人们创造更舒适的环境，国家拨出一部分资金，增设了游艺室、舞厅、图书馆和花园。
    注：这是生长在海边岩石上的一种绿色的软体动物，它伸展开的无数的白色触角，在水中如同盛开的菊花。
    欢腾的海水浴场
    进入七月中旬，洗海水澡的人一天比一天多了。这几天来，海水浴场每天都吸引着成千上万的人。
    在全市最大的可容纳五万人以上的第一海水浴场，每到星期天和工厂的休假日，海面上钻动着密集的人群；海滩上躺着或坐着晒日光浴的人们，好像一床褐色的大地毯，掩盖了海滨的沙滩。当你通过的时候，还得像小孩学走路似地倍加小心，否则就会踏到人的身上。
    水兵们常常成为浴场跳水的示范表演者；很多熟练的游泳能手成了帮助和指教生手们学习自由式、蛙式游泳的义务教练员。成群的孩子们以及初学游泳的人们抱住了酱色的救生圈自由自在的随着海浪飘荡。只要听听被太阳晒黑了的姑娘们和小伙子们的欢笑声，看看老年人从海水里跑上来躺在沙地上表露出来的舒畅的微笑，就会深深体会到为什么人们把跳到海里洗个澡，作为暑天最称心的享受。
    今年，国家已经拨出近四十万元整修和修建青岛市的海水浴场，在今后的两三个月里，将有可能接待比去年（七十多万人次）更多的游泳爱好者。整修后的第一海水浴场的实际面积，已较去年扩大了六分之一，男女更衣室也已经扩建到7，825平方公尺。人们最关心的安全设备——防鲨鱼网，已经用新的油过的棕绳整修完毕；同时今年又新增了两只快速救护艇。航海俱乐部
    七月十四日，青岛市航海俱乐部开学了。
    今年暑假，将有七千多名男女青年参加这儿的航海活动，参加的人数，比过去任何一年都多。
    这个航海俱乐部，是业余性的群众组织，专为青年学习航海知识、锻练身体设立的。凡是对航海有兴趣的国家工作人员、工人、店员、学生和市民，都可以到航海俱乐部去学习游泳、荡桨、驶帆、海上通讯、操纵摩托艇、制作舰船模型等各种航海知识和技能。两三年来，航海俱乐部已经训练了一万二千多名学员，而且有的已经成为航海运动的能手。
    夏日的衣食住行
    青岛市的服务性行业，也给人们妥善地安排了夏日生活中的衣食住行。全市规模最大的国营百货公司第一门市部，据至七月上旬统计，已扩大经营品种13，434种，六月份比五月份增加了124种合适的夏季服装，多种式样新颖的游泳衣，特别受到顾客的欢迎。国营贸易公司特地两次派人去上海等地采购了300多种新商品，其中有全国闻名的金华火腿、白塔奶油、鲭鱼子、各式苏（州）点、西点等。各糕点加工厂，也在最近恢复和试制了三十二种新的糕点。
    为了适应人民在夏日生活中的活动特点，在前海沿和栈桥等处新设立了出售副食品、冷食和书报的供应亭。在第一海水浴场和中山公园，还增加了许多流动供应摊，使游览和洗澡的人们随时可以买到点心和水果。
    市内交通方面，铁路局从六月一日起即开始增加了五对市郊列车；市内公共汽车除了增加原有从中山路到汇泉的班车外，又新辟两条由东镇和西镇到海水浴场的专线，全程票价还降低了20％。国营福利公司也积极准备在台西区修整新旅馆。
