    On the Road of Vertical Shaft Construction
    Recording the Builders of the Xing'an Tai Vertical Shaft in Hegang

    The newly built Xing'an Tai Vertical Shaft in Hegang officially went into production on the 20th. Now, when people come to the Xing'an Tai Vertical Shaft, they can see magnificent coal mine buildings on the ground; below the brightly lit mine, production workers have started the combined coal mining machine and begun production.

    For the past four years, in order to develop the large amount of coal reserves underground, the shaft construction workers have excavated more than 200,000 cubic meters of rock in the Xing'an Tai underground and constructed more than 20 kilometers of underground roadways.

    Shaft construction engineer Chen Youji told the reporter with the unique feeling of a shaft construction worker: "People who build shafts all hope to encounter good geological conditions, rocks that are neither too hard nor too soft. This will add a lot of convenience to the work." However, hope is not reality. After the Xing'an Tai Vertical Shaft started construction in August 1952, the shaft only had been excavated more than six meters deep when it encountered quicksand (water-bearing sand layer). Water mixed with sand poured out from the shaft wall, and the project could not continue. The workers initially decided to continue construction by driving wooden planks into the quicksand layer to prevent the sand layer from flowing. However, after ten days of testing, it failed because the sand layer was very dense and contained gravel, and the wooden planks could not be driven in.

    At this time, opinions varied. Some suggested using the "caisson method," and others suggested using the "grouting method." After more than 20 days, Liang Zhiyi, the deputy shaft construction engineer, proposed a construction plan of a large shaft surrounding a small shaft based on everyone's opinions. After testing, the water subsided along with the small shaft, and the sand layer not only did not flow but was also very solid. The workers successfully overcame the quicksand layer.

    The Xing'an Tai Vertical Shaft is located in a low-lying area, and the underground water inflow is very large. When the shaft was excavated to a depth of more than 40 meters, heavy water, like a torrential rain, poured down directly from the shaft wall; sometimes, newly drilled blast holes could spray water columns two meters high. Workers wearing leather vests and leather pants in the mine were also ineffective. After a long time, their hands and faces would be swollen by the heavy water. Due to the large amount of water inflow in the mine, it was difficult to load explosives after drilling blast holes; even if the explosives were loaded, some of them would be soaked by the water and would not explode. "Misfire" accidents occurred constantly, and the excavation efficiency was very low.

    What to do? Let the technical personnel and workers come up with ideas together! They thought and thought, tried and tried, and finally decided to coat the explosives with a waterproof agent and connect several explosives loaded in one blast hole together. This stopped the "misfires." At the same time, they promoted the construction method of large circulation chart operations, which doubled the excavation efficiency.

    The shaft project was completed, and the construction of underground transportation roadways began. In the mine, the workers encountered new difficulties in the fault zone. The strata were uneven, the roof was broken, and every time a tunnel was opened, the roof would collapse. Therefore, the roadway project was often forced to stop. The three excavation teams of Jiang Longqi, Liu Shuchang, and Zhang Xiaohe, working in the north roadway of the auxiliary shaft, could sometimes only excavate one meter in five days. Later, they used thick steel bars densely arranged to drive into the rock layer to protect the loose and easily collapsing roof and both sides, thus advancing one meter in three days. Once, because the steel bars were not neatly placed, the pressure of the roof lowered the roadway, and even a jack could not lift it up. They hardened both sides and supported the roof with steel rails, preventing the roof from collapsing. In this way, although these three teams worked under arduous conditions, there were never any casualties.

    The roadway project continued to advance. When the east main roadway advanced to more than 90 meters, the multi-fractured water-bearing sandstone came to cause trouble again. At the beginning of September 1954, just as the workers launched a labor competition to welcome the convocation of the First National People's Congress and National Day, a fissure suddenly gushed out an unprecedented amount of water after a blast. The water poured down directly from the roof like it was sprayed from a fire hydrant, causing the water inflow in the mine to suddenly increase two and a half times. The original drainage equipment was not enough. At this critical moment, engineers, technicians, and Soviet experts all went down to the mine, and they carried out emergency rescue work together with the shaft construction workers. The workers worked day and night in the water to build underground waterproof walls and install drainage pumps. Everyone worked non-stop soaked in water, and finally, at the critical moment when the water sump and roadways were full of water, six water pumps were installed. The ferocious underground flood was subdued.

    Now, the raw coal produced by the Xing'an Tai Vertical Shaft will be supplied in large quantities to the needs of trains, ships, and power plants. When we travel on speeding trains and comfortable ships, let us always remember those shaft construction workers who are not afraid of difficulties and work hard!

    在建设竖井的道路上
    记鹤岗兴安台竖井的建设者
    新华社记者　孙若刚
    新建鹤岗兴安台竖井，二十日正式投入生产。现在当人们来到兴安台竖井的时候，在地面上已经可以看到雄伟壮丽的煤矿建筑物；在灯光辉煌的矿井下面，生产工人已经开动联合采煤机，开始进行生产了。
    四年以来，建井工人们为了开发地下蕴藏的大量煤炭，在兴安台地下掘凿出了二十多万立方公尺的岩石，建设了纵横二十多公里长的地下巷道。
    建井工程师陈有继怀着建井人员特有的心情告诉记者说：“建井的人都希望遇到好的地质条件，不硬不软的岩石。这样就会给工作增加不少便利。”但是，希望并不就是现实。兴安台竖井在1952年8月开工以后，井筒才掘凿了六公尺多，就遇上了流砂（含水砂层），水搅着砂从井壁上一齐涌出来，工程不能继续进行了。职工们开始决定用木板打进流砂层里阻止砂层流动的方法继续施工。但是，经过十天的试验，终因砂层组织很密并且含有砾石，木板打不进去而失败了。
    这时，大家意见纷纷，有说用“沉井法”，有说用“注浆法”，一直经过二十多天，建井副工程师梁志义才根据大家的意见提出了大井套小井的施工方案。经过试验，水随小井降下去了，砂层不仅不流动而且很坚固。职工们胜利地渡过了流砂层。
    兴安台竖井处于低洼地带，地下涌水量很大。当井筒掘进到四十多公尺深的时候，淋头大水就像暴雨一样从井壁上面直浇下来；有时刚打完的炮眼，能够喷出两公尺高的水柱。工人们穿着皮背心、皮裤在井下工作也不顶事，时间一长，手、脸就会被淋头水打肿。由于井下涌水太大，打了炮眼，装药也困难；即便把药装进去了，有的炮药被水浸湿也不响。“丢炮”事故不断发生，掘进效率很低。
  怎么办呢？还是技术人员和工人一起想法吧！他们想了又想，试了又试，最后决定在炮药上涂上防水剂，把一个炮眼里装的几个炮药联在一起。这样不再“丢炮”了。同时，他们又推广了大循环图表作业的施工方法，使掘进效率提高了一倍。
    井筒工程完成了，开始建设井下运输巷道。在井下，职工们又遇到了断层地带的新困难。地层参差不齐，顶板破碎，开拓一个洞，顶板就要塌落。因此巷道工程经常被迫停工。在副井北巷工作的姜隆起、刘树常、张小和三个掘进组，有时五天才能掘进一公尺。后来他们用粗钢筋密排着打进岩层里，护住松软易塌的顶板和两帮，这样三天就进一公尺。有一次由于打的钢筋不整齐，顶板的压力把巷道压低了，用千斤顶也顶不起来。他们硬把两帮加厚，顶板用钢轨架住，防止了顶板塌落。就这样，这三个小组虽然在艰巨的条件下工作，但是从来没有发生过伤亡事故。
    巷道工程继续前进。当东大巷前进到九十多公尺的时候，多裂隙的含水砂岩又来作乱了。1954年9月初，正当职工们展开了劳动竞赛迎接第一届全国人民代表大会召开和国庆节的时候，在一次放炮之后，一个裂隙忽然涌出了空前未有的大水。水像从消防队用的水龙头喷出来的一样，从顶板上直浇下来，使井下涌水量骤增两倍半。原有的排水设备不够用了。在这十分危急的时候，工程师、技术员和苏联专家都到了井下，他们和建井工人一起进行了紧急抢救工作。工人们一面抢筑井下防水墙，一面安装排水泵。大家泡在水里昼夜不停地工作，终于在水仓、巷道都储满水的紧急关头，安装好了六台水泵。凶猛的地下洪水被治服了。
    现在，兴安台竖井出产的原煤就要大量供应火车、轮船、发电厂的需要了。当我们乘上奔驰的火车和舒适的轮船旅行的时候，让我们永远记住那些不害怕困难、辛勤劳动的竖井建设者吧！
