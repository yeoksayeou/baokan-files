Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from London: Many British newspapers, in commenting on Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal, used the most vicious language to launch personal attacks on Egyptian President Nasser, comparing him to Hitler, for example.

Some newspapers, while issuing anti-Egyptian statements, tried to create the impression that Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal was inconsistent with international law. Some newspapers also attempted to create a war hysteria around the Suez Canal issue and put forward a risky proposition: to "pacify" Egypt by force. However, this plan proposed by the belligerent colonialists was condemned by clear-headed British politicians and celebrities. Former Defense Minister and Labour Party member Shinwell said at a conference in Belgumshire: "No matter what happens, we should not get involved in a new war."

"The People," a newspaper with millions of copies printed and which usually takes good account of the opinions of middle-class Britons, said in its July 29th editorial: "Belligerent words deepen the danger of war... It is unwise to say such things. The death of the first Egyptian soldier in this conflict would ignite a fire throughout the Middle East. We would be justly accused of provoking war for the cause of imperialism."

"The Sunday Times" pointed out: "Armed intervention is an incorrect and unnecessary method." However, this newspaper, like some other right-wing newspapers, advocated economic and financial pressure on Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from Washington: Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal has triggered a wide range of reactions in the American press.

The "Washington Post" published an editorial on July 28th saying: "It is doubtful what effect the means that Western countries can take to deal with Egypt's actions will have, because sanctions and similar economic measures may make Nasser more determined to make things difficult for the West."

The "Washington Post" acknowledged that Egypt's actions were prompted by the Anglo-American manipulation in helping to build the Aswan Dam.

Many New York newspapers commented on Egypt's actions in a very presumptuous and insulting tone.

The "New York Times," in its July 28th editorial, demanded arrogantly that "economic and legal" pressure be used to deal with Egypt, but at the same time admitted that the matter could not be resolved by force. In a report by the "New York Herald Tribune's" London correspondent, a method was proposed to threaten Egypt by dumping American cotton on the world market.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from TASS, Paris, July 29th: French right-wing newspapers commented on the Egyptian government's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company in a very angry tone. "L'Aurore," "Les Echos," and other bourgeois newspapers tried to portray this decision as an "illegal act," a "challenge to the West," and demanded that Western governments use various methods to put pressure on Egypt.

However, "Le Figaro" admitted that it was unfounded for some right-wing newspapers to say that Egypt's decision seemed to be "threatening peace." "Le Figaro" warned against the reckless use of force in the Suez Canal area. The newspaper pointed out that doing so would provoke firm resistance from Arab countries, and "Asian public opinion would unanimously oppose the West."

Comments in other newspapers also pointed out that the attempt by certain Western politicians to intimidate Egypt was bound to fail.

    英美法资产阶级报纸言论陷于混乱
    一面恫吓埃及一面承认吓不了埃及
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国许多报纸在评论埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有这件事的时候，用最恶毒的字眼对埃及总统纳赛尔进行人身攻击。例如，把纳赛尔比作希特勒。
    一些报纸在发出反埃及的言论的时候，企图使人相信，似乎埃及收回苏彝士运河是不符合国际法准则的。还有些报纸企图围绕苏彝士运河问题制造战争歇斯底里气氛，并且提出一种冒险主张：用武力“平服”埃及。但是好战的殖民主义者提出的这种计划遭到了英国头脑清醒的政治家和社会名流的谴责。前国防部长、工党人士辛威尔在贝尔格姆郡的一次会议上讲话说：“无论发生了什么事，我们也不要卷入新战争”。
    出版几百万份的、通常很好地考虑中等阶层英国人的意见的“人民报”七月二十九日的社论说：“好战的话加深战争的危险。……说这种话是不智的。在这种冲突中第一个埃及士兵的死亡就会燃起整个中东的大火。大家就会公正地指责我们，说我们为了帝国主义的事业而挑起战争。”
      “星期日泰晤士报”指出：“武装干涉是不正确的、也是不必要的办法。”可是，这家报纸又和其他一些右翼报纸一样，鼓吹对埃及施行经济和财政上的压力。
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定引起美国报界的广泛反应。
    七月二十八日的“华盛顿邮报发表社论说：西方国家为了对付埃及的行动“所能够采取的手段会有什么效果是可以怀疑的，因为制裁和类似的经济措施可能会使纳赛尔更加决心要刁难西方。”
      “华盛顿邮报”承认埃及的行动是英美在帮助建设阿斯旺水坝问题上玩弄阴谋手段所促成的。
    许多纽约报纸用非常放肆和侮辱性的语调来评论埃及的行动。
  “纽约时报”在七月二十八日的社论中蛮横地要求用“经济和法律”压力来对付埃及，但是它同时承认这件事是不能用武力解决的。在“纽约先驱论坛报”驻伦敦记者的报道中，提出了用美国棉花在世界市场上倾销的办法来威胁埃及。
    据新华社30日讯　塔斯社巴黎二十九日讯：法国右翼报纸以十分愤怒的语调评论埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的决定。“震旦报”、“回声报”和其他一些资产阶级报纸竭力把这一决定说成是“非法行为”，是“向西方的挑战”，并且要求西方政府用种种办法来对埃及施加压力。
    可是，“费加罗报”承认，一些右翼报纸说埃及的决定好像是“威胁着和平”，这是没有根据的。“费加罗报”警告不要冒险地在苏彝士运河区使用武力。这家报纸指出，这样做就会引起阿拉伯国家的坚决反抗，“亚洲的舆论就会一致反对西方”。
    其他一些报纸的评论中也指出，西方某些政界人士企图恐吓埃及，这是一定要失败的。
