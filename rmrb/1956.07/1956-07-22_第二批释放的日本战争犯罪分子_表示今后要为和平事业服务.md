Xinhua News Agency, July 21st:杉山安太, a Japanese war criminal who was seriously ill and recovered his health only after being treated and transfused at a hospital in Taiyuan, told Xinhua reporters, "I committed many brutal crimes in China, but the Chinese people saved my life with their blood. I don't know how to express my gratitude." He said, "A sinner like me deserves to die, but the Chinese government has consistently given me humanitarian treatment. As I am about to leave China, I deeply thank the Chinese people for this lenient treatment and will dedicate the rest of my life to the cause of peace and the cause of the liberation of the Japanese nation."

杉山安太 is one of the Japanese war criminals recently released in Fushun and Taiyuan in the second batch. This group of released Japanese war criminals unanimously expressed their gratitude for the lenient treatment of the Chinese people and expressed their intention to work hard to serve the cause of peace. 尾崎修三, the former captain of the 4th Company of the 22nd Battalion of the 4th Independent Garrison Unit of the former Japanese North China Dispatch Army and the former colonel and captain of the Armored Battalion of the Datong Training Regiment of the former Taiyuan Pacification Office, said, "I deeply thank the Chinese people for the grace of rebirth. I was wrong in the past, and this makes me never forget it. Now I am embarking on a new path in life, which is the path of fighting for peace. On this path, I will always be a loyal friend of the Chinese people." 羽鸟猛次, 渡边楠之, and 远谷文雄, who were released in Taiyuan, asked reporters to convey to the Chinese people their regret for the past and their determination to fight for peace today.

岛口信重, who was released in Fushun, said, "China has treated me leniently and allowed me to return to my hometown. What else can I say besides gratitude and repentance?" Before his release, 岛口信重 was detained in the War Criminals Management Office of the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The old site of this management office was originally a prison where Japanese imperialism imprisoned Chinese patriots. 岛口信重 served as the director of management and education in this prison in 1945, where he abused and killed Chinese patriots. He said, "During my life in the management office, we received humane treatment. The staff of the management office never beat or scolded me and respected our personality."

饭守重任, the former judge of the 新京 High Court of the puppet Manchukuo, said after being released in Fushun, "I never thought that a positive supporter of aggression against China like me would receive lenient treatment." He said, "According to international law, the victim's country has the full sovereignty to deal with those who have committed crimes against it in the war of aggression, and my crimes are serious." 饭守重任's wife, four children, and two older brothers are all in Tokyo, Japan. He said, "My brother and I are both Christians, and supporting peace and opposing war is in line with the teachings of Christianity. After I return home, I hope that my family can contribute to peace in the future."

    第二批释放的日本战争犯罪分子
    表示今后要为和平事业服务
    据新华社21日讯　一个身患过重病而得到太原一所医院治疗并输血才恢复了健康的日本战争犯罪分子杉山安太对新华社记者说：“我曾经在中国犯下许多残暴的罪行，但是中国人民却用他们的鲜血挽救了我的生命。我不知道该用什么话来表达我内心的感激。”他说：“像我这样的罪人，是死有余辜的，但是中国政府却始终如一地给了我人道主义待遇。我在就要离开中国的时候，深深地感谢中国人民的这种宽大处理，将把我的后半生献给和平事业，献给日本民族的解放事业。”
    杉山安太是最近在抚顺和太原释放的第二批日本战争犯罪分子中的一个。这批被释放的日本战争犯罪分子一致感激中国人民的宽大处理，表示要努力为和平事业服务。前日本北支那派遣军第四独立警备队第二十二大队第四中队大尉中队长、前太原绥靖公署大同教导总队机甲大队上校大队长尾崎修三说：“我深深地感谢中国人民对我的再生之恩。过去我错了，这使我永远不会忘记。现在我走上了一条新的人生道路，就是为和平而战斗的道路。在这条道路上，我永远是中国人民忠实的朋友。”在太原被释放的羽鸟猛次、渡边楠之和远谷文雄，请求记者向中国人民转达他们对过去的悔恨和今天为和平奋斗的决心。
    在抚顺被释放的岛口信重说：“中国对我宽大处理，让我回到故乡去，我除了感激和悔罪以外，还有什么话可说呢？”岛口信重在释放前被关押在中国人民解放军沈阳军区战犯管理所。这个管理所的旧址原是日本帝国主义监禁中国爱国志士的一所监狱。岛口信重曾在1945年担任这所监狱的管理兼教育科长，在这里虐待和残杀过我国爱国志士。他说：“在管理所生活期间，我们受到了人道待遇，管理所工作人员从来没有打骂过我，尊重我们的人格。”
    伪满洲国新京高等法院庭长饭守重任在抚顺被释放以后说：“想不到像我这样一个侵略中国的积极支持者会得到宽大处理。”他说：“按国际法规定，被害者的国家自己完全有主权处理在侵略战争中对它犯有罪行的人，而我的罪行是严重的。”饭守重任的妻子、四个孩子和两个哥哥现在都在日本东京。他说：“我和我的哥哥都是基督教徒，拥护和平、反对战争是和基督教的教义相符合的。我回到家里后，希望一家人今后都能为和平贡献力量。”
