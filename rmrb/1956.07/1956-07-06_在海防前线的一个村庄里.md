    In a Village on the Haifang Front Line
    Bai Ai
    On the Fujian coastal front line, there is a village close to the sea, only a sea away from the enemy-occupied Little Kinmen Island. When I came here, I saw this village, which was often harassed by Chiang Kai-shek's naval forces in the past. White sails dotted the sea, wheat waves undulated in the fields, farmers were harvesting, fishermen were casting nets, morning smoke slowly rose in the village, and the sound of children reading aloud came from the small school with red roofs. When I talked to a group of farmers who were harvesting wheat about their living conditions, they all said in unison: If it weren't for the protection of the navy's artillery, it wouldn't be like this today.
    In the past, Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Kinmen Island often shelled this village from across the sea; houses were set on fire, cattle were killed, and people's normal lives were disrupted: they could not go to sea to fish, could not go to the fields to produce, and even staying at home was dangerous as they could be bombed and injured. They had to flee to the mountains with their children. The village became deserted and the fields were barren. At this time, a coastal artillery company of our army was stationed here. While accurately returning fire on the enemy, they also began to repair the homes for the villagers. They rebuilt the collapsed walls with bricks and stones, drove the unattended livestock into the pens, and took in the chickens and ducks. A squad of soldiers even raised nineteen hens and ducks. This was entrusted to the soldiers of the third squad by the landlord, Old Lady He, to take care of before she went to the mountains to take shelter from the artillery. The soldiers fed them three times a day on time with leftover food, and also found a broken jar, fetched some fresh water, and let the ducks swim and bathe in it. They picked up the eggs laid by the chickens and ducks from the weeds and stored them. One day, they discovered that the water in a large rice field behind the village had dried up, and the rice that had already headed was about to wither. So, the entire company moved, dividing the land into plots and acres to carry water and irrigate the fields. An old woman, whose husband was killed by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery fire, leaving behind three young sons, could not cultivate the fields. The soldiers of the third squad would send comrades who knew how to farm to plow the land, transplant seedlings, deliver manure, weed, and harvest every Sunday. All three mu of paddy fields were taken care of by the third squad until the old woman's three mu of paddy fields joined the cooperative. During these days, the company's medic was also particularly busy, bandaging those who were injured by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery fire, and bandaging the injured cattle and livestock. When the soldiers found that the villagers who had fled were crowded in damp and dirty air-raid shelters, the medic sprayed DDT and disinfectant into the air-raid shelters and gave medicine and injections to those who were sick. On Sundays, the soldiers also organized a comfort team, bringing gramophones, picture books, painting albums, as well as old clothes and shoes donated by the soldiers themselves, to the air-raid shelters to offer comfort.
    Under the protection of the coastal artillery, the villagers were able to return to visit their long-lost homes. They unexpectedly found that the crops were bearing full ears of rice, which were about to ripen; wooden signs were also inserted on the ridges of the fields, with words such as "Responsible by a certain platoon of a certain squad" written on them, which turned out to be the boundaries divided by the soldiers when they were watering the fields; the areas in front of and behind the houses were cleaned neatly; and the chickens, ducks, and pigs were fed plump and large. Chen Deming, the squad leader of the third squad, delivered a full basket of chicken eggs and duck eggs to Old Lady He, the landlord who had returned, moving the old woman to tears, and she insisted on sharing half of the eggs with the soldiers. People who returned to their homes, seeing this situation, were determined to stay and persist in production. The artillery soldiers explained the common sense of air defense and artillery defense to the masses, and also assisted them in digging many air-raid shelters beside the fields and behind the houses. From then on, the villagers could not only go to the fields to produce at night, but also during the day. When the enemy shelled, the organized militiamen and sentries would direct the villagers to disperse and take cover, and the artillery would fiercely retaliate against the enemy. Before each time the fishermen went to sea, they would always inform the artillery in advance. During the day, when the fishermen were casting hooks and nets on the sea, the gunners would sit on the gun positions and monitor the enemy. At night, the fishermen would also inform the sentries on duty before going to sea. When the sentries handed over the shift, in addition to explaining the situation and passwords, they also had to explain a special task: "Wake up someone in the east end of the village at a certain time in the middle of the night to go fishing." Sometimes it was written on the blackboard with chalk, and when the time came, whoever was on duty would be responsible for knocking on the door to wake up the fisherman.
    In their common life, the feelings between the fishermen and the artillerymen have become closely connected. When the soldiers saw the fishermen fishing in the rain, they took off their raincoats and put them on the soaked fishermen. When they saw that the fishermen's feet were cut by rocks while fishing, they applied the Vaseline used to wipe the cannons on them. Whenever a typhoon struck, they would help the fishermen lift their boats, and even jump into the sea at the risk of wind and waves to chase back the fishing boats that were swept away by the wind and waves. They also lent the fishermen their allowance money, which they were reluctant to use. This allowed the fishermen to buy food, repair fishing boats and fishing nets when the enemy artillery was frequent and they could not go to sea to fish. The fishermen also actively participated in the intense struggle against the enemy. The fishermen and soldiers stood guard together and patrolled the coast at night. Many times, the enemy sent "water ghosts" to swim over at night, and they were all discovered by the fishermen.
    An old woman, Li, whose daughter was killed by enemy artillery fire, risked sailing a boat to the front line of the enemy island to deliver propaganda materials, regardless of anyone's dissuasion; young girls helped the army paste large kites for propaganda against the enemy in the middle of the night; a woman whose husband was in Taiwan reported to the army that a special agent who attempted to sneak into her home in the middle of the night using old relationships; two Young Pioneers discovered that the military telephone line had been cut by a special agent on their way to school, one guarding the broken wire, and the other braving the heavy rain to report to the artillery soldiers...
    In this small village on the front line, the struggle is fierce and the environment is difficult, however, the lives of the soldiers and the villagers are happy.

    在海防前线的一个村庄里
    白艾
    在福建海岸前线，有一个紧靠海边的村庄，离敌占小金门岛只有一海之隔。当我来到这里的时候，我看到这个过去经常遭到海上蒋军骚扰的村庄，海边白帆点点，田里麦浪起伏，农民在收割，渔民在撒网，村庄里晨烟徐起，红屋顶的小学校里，传出来孩子们的读书声。当我和一群正在割麦的农民谈起他们的生活情形时，他们都异口同声地说：如果没有海军的大炮保护我们，是不会像今天这样的。
    从前，金门岛的蒋军经常用大炮隔海轰击这个村庄；房屋被打着起火，耕牛被打死，人们的正常生活被破坏了：不能下海捕鱼，不能下地生产，呆在家里也有被炸死炸伤的危险。他们不得不携儿带女逃到山里去。村庄变得冷冷清清，田园荒芜了。正当这个时候，我军一个海岸炮连驻守到这里来。他们一面以准确的炮火回击敌人，一面动手为老乡们修整起家园。把被敌人炮火击塌的墙头用砖石重新垒上，把无人喂养的牲畜赶进畜棚，把鸡鸭收养起来。有一个班的战士，还喂养了十九只母鸡和母鸭。这是房东何老太太为了到山里去防炮，临行前委托给三班的战士们喂养的。战士们用剩饭每天按时喂三次，还找了个破缸，挑些淡水，让鸭子在里面游泳洗澡。把鸡鸭下的蛋从乱草里捡回存放起来。有一天，他们发现庄后一大片水稻田里水已干尽，已经抽穗的稻子眼看快要枯死了，于是，整个连队都动起来，分块分亩挑水浇地。有位老大娘，丈夫被蒋军炮火打死，丢下三个小儿子，田地无法耕种。三班的战士就每到星期日，选派会种地的同志去翻地、插秧、送粪、拔草、收割，三亩水田全部由三班包种了，直到老大娘的三亩水田入了社为止。在这些日子里，连队的卫生员也特别繁忙，不是给被蒋军炮火打伤的人包扎，就是给被打伤的耕牛牲畜裹伤。当战士们发现逃难的老乡挤在潮湿、污秽的防炮洞里时，卫生员就给他们向防炮洞里打滴滴涕和消毒药水，并给那些得了病的人吃药、打针。星期日，战士们还组织了慰问小组，带了留声机、小人书、画报以及战士们自动捐献的旧衣旧鞋，到防炮洞里去慰问。
    在海岸炮兵的保护下，老乡们可以回来探望久别后的家园了。他们意想不到庄稼结着饱满的稻穗，眼看就要熟透了；田埂上还插着木牌，上写“某排某班负责”等字样，原来这是战士们浇地时划分的界线；家前屋后打扫得整齐干净；鸡鸭猪喂得又肥又大。三班长陈德明把满满一筐鸡蛋和鸭蛋送到回来的房东何老太太面前，感动得这位老人家流着泪，硬要把鸡蛋分一半给战士们。回到家园的人们，看到这种情形，都决心留下来坚持生产了。炮兵战士们向群众讲解了防空防炮常识，并且还协助他们在地边、屋后挖了许多防炮洞。从此老乡们不仅夜晚，白天也能下地生产了。敌人一打炮，组织起来的民兵、岗哨就指挥老乡们分散掩蔽，炮兵们就狠狠地还击敌人。渔民们每次下海前，总要事先告诉炮兵。白天，当渔民们在海面上下钩撒网的时候，炮手们就坐在炮位上监视着敌人。夜晚，渔民们要下海也事先告诉值班的哨兵。哨兵在往下交班的时候，除了交代情况和口令外，还要交待一样特殊的任务：“半夜几点几分，叫醒庄东头某某人下海捕鱼。”有时就用粉笔写在黑板上，到了时间，该谁的班谁就负责去敲门叫醒渔民。
    在共同的生活中，渔民和炮兵的感情，已经血肉相连。战士们看到渔民在雨天捕鱼的时候，他们把身上的雨衣脱下来给淋得湿透的渔民披上，看见渔民在打鱼的时候脚被岩石划破了口子，就把擦炮用的凡士林给他们抹上。每当刮起台风，他们就帮助渔民抬船，甚至冒着风浪跳进海里去把被风浪卷走的渔船追回来。他们还把舍不得用的津贴费也借给渔民。好让渔民们在敌人炮击频繁不能下海捕鱼时，买粮食、修补鱼船和鱼网。渔民们也积极参加了紧张的对敌斗争。渔民和战士们一起站岗放哨，夜晚在海边巡逻。许多次，敌人在夜晚派“水鬼”游过来，都被渔民们发现了。
    一个被敌炮打死了女儿的李大娘，不顾任何人的劝阻，冒险划船到敌岛前沿去送宣传品；青年姑娘们半夜三更帮军队糊对敌宣传用的大风筝；一个丈夫在台湾的妇女，向军队检举了企图利用旧关系半夜三更潜进家里来的特务；两个少先队员在上学途中，发现军用电话被特务剪断了，一个守着断电线，一个冒着大雨，跑去报告炮兵战士……。
    在这个前沿的小村庄里，斗争是激烈的，环境是艰苦的，然而，战士们和村里人的生活是愉快的。
