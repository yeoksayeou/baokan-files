    A Factual Error in a News Report
    In the news report "Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Reaps a Bumper Harvest of Early Rice" that we published, it stated that in the five counties of the Wuzhi Mountain area, "47 mu have been found with a yield of 1,260 jin per mu, and 4,214 mu have a yield of 885 jin per mu..." This is inaccurate. The highest yield of early rice here is 852 jin per mu, and it did not reach 1,000 jin per mu. (Note: This news was published on the front page of the People's Daily on June 24th.)
    The reason for the factual error in the report is that the county committee mistakenly reported the yield of the local customary mu as the yield of the city mu to the prefectural committee (one customary mu is equivalent to 1.8, 1.6, or 1.4 city mu); a data clerk in the prefectural committee's production headquarters wrote this material into a manuscript and sent it to us; and we did not investigate and verify it, so we sent this news to you.

    一篇报道失实的新闻
    我们所发的“海南黎族苗族自治州早稻丰收”的新闻中说：五指山区五个县“已发现每亩产量1，260斤的有47亩，885斤的有4，214亩……”，这是失实的。这里的早稻最高产量是852斤一亩，并没有达到千斤亩的。（按：这一新闻登载在六月二十四日人民日报第一版。）
    造成报道失实的原因，是县委错把当地的习惯亩的产量当成市亩的产量向地委报告（一亩习惯亩相当于市亩1.8亩、1.6亩或1.4亩不等）；地委生产指挥部的一位资料员，就把这一材料写成稿件寄给我们；而我们也没有经过调查核对，就把这一新闻发给你们了。
