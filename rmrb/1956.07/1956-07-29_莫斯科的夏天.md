    Moscow Summer
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    Moscow's summers have long days; at the longest, it feels like you close your eyes and it's already dawn, with the night lasting only three or four hours. However, those of us who have experienced the climate of the South always feel that there is no real hot weather in Moscow. Look, you have to wear a jacket in the morning and evening, and you still feel chilly when the sun isn't out or in the shade—how can this be considered hot weather? Therefore, Soviet workers who go to the southern Soviet Union for their annual vacations in the summer are not so much trying to escape the heat as they are looking for sunshine and a dip in the sea.
    This year, Moscow's summer is starting to feel more like it should. The alcohol column on the thermometer frequently rises to twenty or even thirty degrees Celsius. The sun feels a little scorching on the skin. Ice cream stands all over the city are constantly serving customers, selling sixty to seventy tons of ice cream daily, and seventy-five tons on Sundays. In the evenings and at night, there are often heavy downpours, sometimes mixed with loud thunder and lightning that splits the sky. … I jokingly said to some Indian friends, "Perhaps it's because more Chinese and Indians are coming to Moscow, bringing the southern climate with them."
    Life in Moscow is even more vibrant in the summer. Every day after six o'clock in the afternoon, especially after four o'clock on Saturday afternoons and on Sundays, Moscow's various street gardens, cultural parks, swimming pools, and sports fields suddenly become lively, filled with people looking for a place to relax.
    Many buildings and few courtyards are characteristic of Moscow's architecture. Therefore, residents treat the street gardens and tree-lined avenues near their homes as public courtyards. Those pushing strollers, knitting, reading, and chatting make almost every normally empty chair occupied. The continuous trees and lush tree-lined avenues along the walls of the Kremlin, around the central district, and near the Garden Ring Road are indeed convenient places for busy housewives, lively children, pensioned elderly, and residents who do not want to go far to relax.
    Cultural recreation parks with open-air theaters, cinemas, sports fields, swimming pools, exhibition halls, and reading rooms attract many people. There are twenty or thirty parks of various sizes in Moscow. Some people like to look out at the scenery of the Moscow River in Gorky Park; others love to enjoy the flavor of the Moscow suburban forests in Izmailovo Park. The beautiful Sokolniki Park welcomes and bids farewell to 50,000 visitors every day. Summer parks are often lively and joyful gathering places. At the end of the semester, students from various universities in Moscow held a traditional get-together in Gorky Park.
    It is said that Moscow has a population of six million. Even if there are many gardens and parks in the city, it obviously cannot satisfy everyone. Many ordinary workers find a dacha in the suburbs. Some rent from local residents, some build their own, and some are provided by the government. These are mostly small wooden houses, like Russian peasant wooden houses, scattered in the forests around Moscow. After work every day, people take electric trains to their dachas and return to Moscow to work the next morning.
    Since the shortening of the workday on Saturdays, many people go to the countryside early. Naturally, more go to the countryside early on Sundays. When the streets of Moscow have not yet awakened, many vehicles carrying dry food, musical instruments, balls, books, and chess drive directly from the gates of factories and institutions to the suburbs. They are not going to relax at a dacha, but to have a picnic. The suburbs of Moscow are rich in elegant birch forests and beautiful fir forests, and there are also several rivers where you can swim. Picnickers often go to Khimki, where the Moscow Canal reservoir is located. The bathing area there can accommodate 5,000 people. On clear days with no wind or clouds, you can see men and women floating in the water and resting on the shore along the coast. Scenic Sinigiri, on the banks of the Istra River, is also a favorite picnic spot for Muscovites. One side of the river is dense forest, and the other is open grassland. Swimming, playing volleyball, playing football, lying down to read, singing, and dancing impromptu – everyone enjoys themselves to the fullest. When people return from picnics in the countryside in the evening, they always bring back large bunches of fresh flowers and arrange the location for the next outing.
    Many children live in dachas and summer camps in the suburbs in the summer. But many children still stay in Moscow. Pioneer camps are also organized in the city. The Pioneer camp at No. 3 Sadovsky Lane exists in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the summer, children do crafts and play under the big trees. The courtyard often becomes an open-air dance hall. In the evening, a screen is hung on the wall, and a temporary cinema immediately appears. All of this is organized by the residents of this building. They also organize recreational activities and theater visits for the children, and hold visits and trips. The children play there from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., with free food and drinks.
    Travel is an interesting part of the weekly activities of Moscow middle school students. In mid-June, 800 middle school students made a ten-day trip in the suburbs of Moscow. They started from various places and met at a final destination. The vast majority walked, some rode bicycles, and one team took to the water in small boats. They enjoyed the scenery along the way, saw rural life, and wrote down their experiences in their diaries. The diaries recorded their helping drivers pull cars out of the mud in the heavy rain, and helping collective farms plant late-maturing cabbage and weed.
    In this year's summer life of Muscovites, no one has had a more interesting time than the students of various universities in Moscow. Hearing that a great harvest was about to come on the new land, they gave up their vacations and set off to help with the harvest. These young volunteers are sweating under the hot sun. Is not their life a continuation of the summer life of Muscovites? (Attached picture)

### 莫斯科的夏天

    莫斯科的夏天
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    莫斯科的夏天白昼很长，最长时候仿佛一合眼便到天明，黑夜只停留三四个小时。但是，往常像我们这样尝过南方气候味道的人，总觉得在莫斯科没有什么暑天。你看，早晚得穿夹衣，在不出太阳的时候和阳光晒不到的地方还感到凉意，这怎么能算作暑天呢？因此，在夏天里到苏联南方去享受一年一度假期的苏联职工，与其说是去避暑，不如说是去找日光晒，找海水洗。
    今年莫斯科的夏天可有点像样了。温度表上酒精柱经常升到二十度甚至三十度。太阳晒在皮肤上有点灼热。全市冰淇淋小摊不停地应接顾客，每天销售六、七十吨冰淇淋，逢星期天销售七十五吨。傍晚和夜间时常下着滂沱大雨，有时夹杂着响亮的雷声和劈裂天空的闪电。……我向几位印度朋友开玩笑说：“也许因为中国人和印度人来莫斯科的多了，把南方的气候也带来了吧。”
    莫斯科人的生活在夏天里更加活跃了。每天下午六点钟以后，尤其是星期六下午四点钟以后和星期天，莫斯科各个街心花园、文化公园、游泳场、运动场就顿然热闹起来，到处充斥着寻找休息地点的人们。
    楼房多，院子少，是莫斯科建筑的特点。所以居民把住处附近的街心花园、林荫道当作公共的院子。推婴儿车的，织针线的，看书的，谈心的，使平素比较空闲的椅子几乎坐无虚席。克里姆林宫的墙边，中心区的周围，花园圈路的近旁，那里连绵不绝的树木，茂盛的林荫道，确实是忙碌的家庭主妇、活泼的儿童、领抚恤金的老人，以及不愿意走远的居民休息的方便所在。
    设有露天剧场、电影场、运动场、游泳场、展览厅、阅览厅的文化休息公园，吸收着众多的人们。在莫斯科有二三十个大小公园。有人喜欢在高尔基公园了望莫斯科河的景色；有人爱到伊兹迈尔公园领略莫斯科近郊树林的风味。秀丽的索科尼其公园每天就吞吐五万游客。夏天的公园时常是活泼愉快的聚会场所。在学期完了时候，莫斯科各个高等学校的学生在高尔基公园进行了传统的联欢。
    据说莫斯科有六百万人口。即使市内花园、公园再多，显然也不能满足他们。许多普通职工都在近郊找个别墅。这些别墅有租当地居民的，有自己盖的，有公家的。它们多半是用木料构筑的小屋，像俄罗斯农民的木头房子，散布在莫斯科近郊树林里。人们每天下班以后，搭电气火车到别墅去，第二天清早赶回莫斯科工作。
    自从星期六缩短工作日以后，许多人们提早下乡去。自然，更多的在星期天清早下乡。当莫斯科街道还没有醒来的时候，不少车辆带着干粮、乐器、球、书、棋，从工厂和机关的大门直接开到郊外去。他们不是去别墅休息，而是去郊游。莫斯科近郊富有挺秀的白桦林、俊丽的枞树林，也有几处可以游泳的河水。郊游者的节目不断更新着。爱好游泳的人们常到希木金去，那里是莫斯科运河的水库。那里的浴场能够容纳五千人。在无风无云的晴朗日子，你可以沿岸看到男男女女在水里浮沉，在岸边休息着。风景如画的伊斯特拉河边的西尼基里，也是莫斯科人喜爱的郊游地点。河的一边是密密的树林，另一边是开阔的草地。游泳的，打排球的，踢足球的，躺着看书的，引吭高歌的，即兴跳舞的，各尽其乐。到野外郊游的人们，在暮晚归来时候，总是带回大束鲜花，并且约好下次出游的地点。
    许多儿童在夏天住到近郊的别墅和夏令营去。但是不少儿童仍然留在莫斯科市内。在市内也组织少先营。沙多夫斯基巷三号房子内的少先营春夏秋冬都存在。在暑天，孩子们在大树底下做手工玩。院子时常变成露天跳舞厅。晚间，墙上挂起银幕，一个临时电影院立刻就出现了。所有这些都是由这座房子的住户们组织的。他们还为孩子们组织文娱活动和看戏，举办参观和旅行。孩子们在那里从上午十点玩到下午七点，饮食免费。
    旅行是莫斯科中学生们星期活动的一个有趣的项目。六月中，有八百个中学生在莫斯科近郊作了十天旅行。他们从各个地方出发，到一个终点会合。绝大多数步行，有些骑脚踏车，有一队取水路划小艇。他们饱览了沿路风光，见识了农村生活，把自己的见闻都写在日记上。日记上记载了他们在大雨中帮助司机从泥泞中拖出汽车，帮助集体农庄种晚熟白菜和锄草的事情。
    在今年莫斯科人的夏天生活中，没有比莫斯科各个高等学校的学生们过得更加有意思的了。他们听说新地上一场大丰收就要来临，就纷纷放弃了假期，动身到那里帮助收割去了。这班青年志愿者正在火热的太阳底下挥汗劳动着。他们的生活不正是莫斯科人夏天生活的延续么？（附图片）
