Libraries Should Serve Scientists

Tao Menghe

The Party and the government's call for a great advance in science has further increased the task of libraries in serving scientific workers. Libraries welcome this glorious task and should use all their strength to prepare sufficient scientific literature and materials to meet the needs of scientific workers at any time. The Ministry of Culture recently held a national library work conference to discuss this major issue in detail, and achieved certain gains. This timely measure by the Ministry of Culture will surely strengthen the library's ability to serve science. This is deeply gratifying. I would now like to write down some personal opinions on libraries serving science for everyone to correct.

Modern science first developed in several European countries and is a product that has grown alongside capitalist production for the past two to three hundred years. Therefore, the vast majority of scientific publications are written and published in European languages. Before liberation, we did not have the strength to purchase a large number of scientific books and periodicals. Moreover, some of the modern scientific books and periodicals that had already been purchased were unfortunately destroyed by the Japanese invasion war. Therefore, the foundation of scientific literature and materials preserved in our country is very weak. The most urgent task at present is obviously to acquire as completely as possible the scientific classics and periodicals published in the past by various countries around the world that our scientific workers consider most important, for application.

Scientific workers need to refer to or read past books and periodicals from time to time. However, due to the continuous progress of science today, and because we want to strive to catch up with the advanced international scientific level, scientific workers especially need currently published books and periodicals, that is, books and magazines that are being published one after another today. Currently published scientific books and periodicals demonstrate the latest developments in science. Among the currently published books and periodicals, various scientific journals are particularly important. Because the papers or news published in specialized scientific journals describe new inventions, discoveries, and the presentation and discussion of new scientific problems. From these journals, it is sufficient to see the scientific achievements recently obtained by tens of thousands of scientific workers around the world. If our own scientific research can be compared with the achievements published in specialized scientific journals around the world, for example, we have solved problems similar to those journal papers, or our discussion of a certain scientific problem has a contribution as important as those journal papers, then it can also be said that a certain aspect of our scientific research work has reached the advanced international scientific level. Currently published journals (including those from various scientifically advanced countries) are essential for scientific workers at all times and must be consulted and consulted frequently. Only those who do not know what science is would restrict the subscription of scientific journals.

Acquiring all past and current scientific books and periodicals is not an easy task due to the large quantity, limited market sources, and the need for a large amount of foreign exchange. Therefore, not every library can undertake it. In order to have a reasonable organization for the supply of scientific books and periodicals nationwide, it should be developed in two directions. On the one hand, two or three comprehensive scientific book centers should be established nationwide to acquire various scientific books and periodicals as completely as possible. It should be understood that time is the most important condition for the growth of a library. The reason why the world's major libraries have extremely rich collections is because they have a history of hundreds of years or more. Comparing the collection of the Beijing Library (currently more than 4 million volumes) with the collection of the Lenin Library (currently more than 20 million volumes), it can be seen that it takes a considerable amount of time for two or three scientific book centers to develop into large libraries. On the other hand, it is to develop specialized libraries. Specialized libraries specialize in collecting books and periodicals within the scope of their profession. The selection is refined and the acceptance and rejection are strict. Therefore, its collection is most convenient and useful for certain scientific work. At present, our specialized libraries have some foundation. We have the need to develop specialized libraries and the conditions for development. The Geological Library of the Ministry of Geology has a history of decades. The libraries of some research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (such as the Institutes of Geophysics, Petroleum, and Applied Chemistry) already have the nature of specialized libraries. In addition to the scientific and technological, and newspaper and periodical specialized libraries that have already been established, Shanghai can also develop other specialized libraries. In addition, specialized colleges, administrative departments, production units, etc. should also develop their own specialized libraries. The whole country has two or three comprehensive scientific book centers and specialized libraries scattered in various research institutions, specialized colleges, career departments, production departments, etc. If they combine and cooperate with each other, they can form a large library network that supplies scientific literature and materials. This large library network will surely play a huge role in our country's scientific research work.

How do comprehensive scientific book centers and various specialized scientific libraries serve scientific workers? How should they enable the books and periodicals they collect to play their due role? It is necessary to do the following:

First, the library should compile and publish a catalog. For ease of use, comprehensive libraries should preferably compile and print classified catalogs by subject.

Second, in order to let people know what new books and periodicals are available, each book center and each specialized library should compile a catalog of newly purchased books and periodicals, indicating which units collect them, and publish them on a regular basis. The German Democratic Republic publishes such catalogs, which can be imitated.

Third, more helpful to scientific research work than book catalogs are indexes and abstracts of books and periodicals. The index indicates the various sources of information on a problem, and the abstract is a concise introduction or abbreviation of recent scientific books and periodicals. Both can enable scientific workers to know the sources of scientific problem information and the recent developments with less effort and time. This is of great help to scientific workers. As for abstract work, the preparatory office of the Scientific and Technical Information Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is preparing to try out several types, and the library may not interfere. The book and periodical index must still be undertaken by the library. The most useful indexes should be compiled by subject or topic. Indexes of scientific papers should preferably be edited and published by specialized libraries under the guidance of scientific experts.

Fourth, in order to widely supply the needs of all parties for scientific literature and materials, and to enable the collections of each library to be owned and shared by other libraries, each library should be equipped with sufficient duplication tools, including cameras, microfilm copying machines, etc., to make duplicate copies at any time to meet needs. Supplying a large number of copies to libraries across the country by means of duplication is the fastest and most economical way to expand the collections of each library. This is the only way for books and periodicals that are difficult to buy. At the same time, for those publications that are not easy to use and preserve due to poor paper or improper storage (such as the entire "Shen Bao"), copies should be made and preserved as soon as possible to avoid loss.

We have briefly put forward the development direction and tasks of libraries serving science above. In order for the library to successfully complete this task, it must reasonably solve the problems of working cadres and basic construction. At present, every library is faced with this serious problem: the lack of working cadres, the lack of ability of working cadres, insufficient housing, and the lack of buildings suitable for preserving books that are moisture-proof and fire-proof, etc. In the past, there were not many library staff members and they lacked the knowledge and experience of scientific book management. Now, in order to do a good job in scientific library work, and to make library work cadres become a powerful assistant to scientific research work, help scientific workers solve some book-related problems, and save their time and energy, they must have library management knowledge and a certain degree of scientific level, as well as foreign language reading ability. At present, the manpower of various libraries and their working ability are really difficult to cope with the needs of the rapid development of various libraries in the future. It is hoped that the Higher Education Department will make specific plans for cultivating scientific library work cadres and implement them regularly.

The housing problem is a serious threat felt by many libraries today. Many libraries have to pile up a large number of books and periodicals in damp and cramped rooms due to insufficient housing, allowing them to rot and be destroyed. There are also many libraries that store books and periodicals in fire-proof buildings, which cannot guarantee the safety of the books. If a large number of new and old books and periodicals continue to be purchased in the future, the situation will become more serious. In terms of storing books, the scale of basic construction must be relaxed and the quality of construction must be improved. If books are lost due to deficiencies in the quantity and quality of housing, it would be penny-wise and pound-foolish.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of purchasing foreign scientific books and periodicals. Regarding the purchase of foreign books and periodicals, it is easy to go to two extremes, one extreme tends to be strict and the other extreme tends to be broad. The so-called strictness refers to rules and regulations, such as some units even crossing out scientific journals opened by teachers simply because they were published in capitalist countries. Some units do not allow people to purchase or read certain foreign historical works simply because they are not in line with modern views. If books are purchased according to such rules and regulations, there are not many books to buy. The examples cited here are of course exceptional exceptions, which are extremely rare. The so-called broadness is to be inclusive and accept everything. For example, some libraries order a set of each magazine according to the bookstore's magazine catalog, regardless of the content of each publication. This method of purchasing books, together with the recent example in Beijing of purchasing entire shelves of old books from old bookstores, can be called a double gem. This is a lazy and irresponsible way of purchasing books and should be criticized. The magazine catalog compiled by the bookstore is not a systematic scientific catalog, but simply arranges all the periodicals that they know or can order by category or country. It must not be used as a basis for purchase.

Both overly strict and overly broad tendencies are incorrect and must be corrected and avoided. The most reliable way to purchase books and periodicals is to combine the needs of the local area or unit and ask scientists to assist in formulating book and periodical purchase orders. Only people engaged in scientific work know what scientific books and periodicals they need and can buy the publications that are most useful to them. Generally speaking, institutions that do the best scientific work are often the institutions that are best at purchasing books and periodicals. The purchase of scientific books and periodicals cannot be separated from the guidance of scientists.

    图书馆要为科学家服务
    陶孟和
    党和政府向科学大进军的号召，进一步加重了图书馆为科学工作者服务的任务。图书馆欢迎这个光荣的任务，应该用一切力量准备充分的科学文献资料，足以随时供应科学工作者的需要。文化部最近召开了全国图书馆工作会议，详细讨论了这个重大问题，并且有一定的收获。文化部这个及时的措施，一定可以加强图书馆为科学服务的力量。这是深可庆幸的。我现在将个人对于图书馆为科学服务的一些意见写出来，请大家指正。
    现代科学是首先在欧洲几个国家里发达起来的，是二三百年以来和资本主义生产相伴生长的产物，因此绝大部分的科学刊物都是用欧洲文字撰写刊行的。在解放以前，我们没有收买大量科学书刊的力量，就是已经收买到的一些现代科学书刊，又不幸地遭到日本侵略战争的破坏。因此，我国所保有的科学文献资料的基础是非常薄弱的。目前最迫切的工作显然是将我们科学工作者认为最重要的世界各国过去出版的科学典籍、期刊尽可能地收购齐全，以供应用。
    科学工作者时时需要参考或阅读过去的书刊。但是，由于今日科学的不断进步，由于我们要争取赶上国际先进科学水平，科学工作者尤其需要现在发行的书刊，就是今日正在陆续出版的图书杂志。现在发行的科学书刊表现科学最近的发展。在现在发行的书刊中，各种科学的期刊尤为重要。因为专门科学期刊所发表的论文或消息都是叙述一些新的发明、发现以及新的科学问题的提出与探讨。从这些期刊里足以看到全世界数以万计的科学工作者在最近期间所获得的科学上的成就。假使我们自己的科学研究可以同世界上专门科学期刊上所发表的成就相比拟，例如我们解决了和那些期刊论文相类似的问题，或是我们对某个科学问题的讨论有和那些期刊论文同样重要的贡献，那末，也可以说，我们的科学研究工作的某一方面，便达到了国际科学先进水平。现在发行的期刊（包括各个科学先进国家的）对科学工作者来说是时刻必备的，必须经常参考查阅。只有不知科学为何物的人，才会对科学期刊的订购加以限制。
    收购全部过去和现行科学书刊，由于数量大，市场来源有限，需要大量外汇等等原因，不是轻而易举的事。因此，不是每个图书馆所能担任的。为了使全国科学书刊的供应有一合理的组织，应该向两个方面发展。一方面是全国应该成立两个或三个综合性的科学图书中心，尽可能地将各种科学的书刊收购齐全。要知道，对于一个图书馆的成长，时间是最主要的条件。世界各大图书馆所以有极其丰富的收藏，都是因为它们有几百年以上的历史。把北京图书馆的收藏（现有四百余万册）和列宁图书馆的收藏（现有二千余万册）相比，便可以看出，从两三个科学图书中心发展成为大的图书馆，需要一个相当长的时间。另一方面是发展专业图书馆。专业图书馆专收藏专业范围以内的书刊，选择精，取舍严，因之它的收藏对于一定的科学工作最为便利，最为有用。现在，我们专业图书馆已经有了一些基础，我们有发展专业图书馆的需要，也有发展的条件。地质部的地质图书馆已经有几十年的历史。中国科学院的一些研究单位（例如地球物理、石油、应用化学各研究所）的图书室都已经具备专业图书馆的性质。上海市除了已经成立了科学技术、报刊等专业图书馆之外，还可以发展其它专业图书馆。此外，各专门学院、行政部门、生产单位等也应该发展自己的专业图书馆。全国有两三个科学图书中心和散在各地的各研究机构、专门学院、事业部门、生产部门等的专业图书馆结合起来，通力合作，有无相通，就可形成一个供应科学文献资料的大图书馆网。这个大图书馆网对于我国科学研究工作，一定可以起巨大的作用。
    综合性的科学图书中心和各专业科学图书馆如何为科学工作者服务呢？它们应该如何使收藏的书刊发挥它们所应有的作用呢？做好以下各项工作是必要的：
    一、图书馆应该编制目录出版。为便于使用起见，综合性的图书馆最好按学科编印分类目录。
    二、为了使人们知道新到的书刊有哪些，应该由各图书中心和各专业图书馆将新购入的书刊编成目录，注明由那些单位收藏，按期出版。德意志民主共和国出版有这种目录，可以效法。
    三，较图书目录更有助于科学研究工作的是书刊的索引和文摘。索引指示关于一个问题的种种来源，文摘是新近科学图书和期刊的简明介绍或缩写，两者都可以使科学工作者用较少的精力和时间，知道本门科学问题资料的出处以及新近发展的情况。这对于科学工作者有莫大的帮助。至于文摘工作，中国科学院科学情报研究所筹备处正在准备试办若干种，图书馆可不过问。书刊索引仍须由图书馆担任。最有用的索引应该按学科或专题编纂。科学论文索引最好由各专业图书馆在科学专家的指导下编辑刊行。
    四，为了广泛地供应各方面对科学文献资料的需要，为了使每个图书馆的收藏可以为其它图书馆所共有、共享，每个图书馆都应该设备充分的复制工具，包括照相机、显微影片复制机等，随时做出复制拷贝，以应需要。用复制方法供应大量的拷贝给全国各图书馆，是扩大各图书馆收藏的一种最迅速最经济的办法。对于难以买到的书刊，这是惟一的办法。同时，对于那些因为纸张不好或保管不善而不易使用和保存的刊物（例如申报全份），尤其应该从速制出拷贝来保存，以免佚失。
    我们在上面简要地提出了图书馆为科学服务的发展方向和任务。图书馆要胜利地完成这个任务，必须合理地解决工作干部和基本建设问题。目前每个图书馆都面临着这个严重的问题：工作干部缺乏，工作干部能力不强，房子不够，缺乏防潮、防火适于保存图书的建筑，等等。过去，图书馆工作人员本来是不多的，也缺少科学图书管理的知识和经验。现在，要做好科学图书馆的工作，要使图书馆工作干部成为科学研究工作的有力助手，帮助科学工作者解决一些图书方面的问题，节省他们的时间和精力，必须具备图书馆管理知识和一定程度的科学水平，以及外文阅读能力。目前，各图书馆的人力和他们的工作能力，实在难以应付今后各种图书馆飞快发展的需要。希望高等教育部对于培养科学图书馆工作干部这一问题，做出具体计划，定期实行。
    房屋问题是今天许多图书馆所感到的一个严重威胁。许多图书馆因为房子不够，不得不将大量书刊堆积在潮湿狭小的屋子里，任其腐烂毁坏。还有不少图书馆都是将书刊存放在不能防火的建筑物里，不能保证图书的安全。今后若再继续购进大批新旧书刊，情况将更加严重。在存放图书这方面，必须放宽基本建设的尺度，提高建筑质量。如果由于房屋在数量和质量上的缺欠而使图书遭受损失，那就是因小失大了。
    最后说一说购买外文科学书刊问题。关于购买外文书刊容易走向两种偏向，一种偏向趋于严，一种偏向趋于宽。所谓严是指清规戒律，如有的单位竟因为教员所开出的科学杂志，是在资本主义国家出版的，便给划去。有的单位不许人们购买或阅读某种外文历史著作，只因为那是同现代观点不符。如果按这样的清规戒律购进图书，那就没有几本可买了。这里所举的当然是例外之例外，极少见的。所谓宽则是兼收并蓄，细大不捐。例如有的图书馆按照书店的杂志目录，不管每种刊物的内容如何，都各订购一套。这种购买图书的方法，同最近在北京发现的购买旧书店的整架的旧图书的例子，可称双绝。这是懒汉的、不负责任的购书办法，应该予以批评。书店所编定的杂志目录并不是一个系统的科学的目录，不过是将他们所知道的或者可以订到的一切期刊，按门类或国别加以编排而已，万不能作为购买的依据。
    过严和过宽两种偏向都是不正确的，必须纠正和避免。最可靠的购买书刊的办法是结合当地或本单位的需要，请科学家们协助制定购买书刊订单。只有从事科学工作的人们，才知道他们所需要的科学书刊是些什么书，才会买到他们最得用的刊物。一般地说，科学工作做得最好的机关，常是最会购买书刊的机关。购买科学书刊是不能离开科学家的指导的。
