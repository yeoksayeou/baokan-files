Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st – After being tested by several flood peaks this year, extensive dike inspection and reinforcement activities have begun on crucial dike sections in Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces along the Yangtze River.

　　In mid-July, more than 7,000 laborers on the Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province were busy inspecting the dikes and repairing dangerous works. They recently completed 34 kilometers of wave protection projects and more than 500 dike repair projects. The newly built Honghu diversion dike was tested by the last flood peak, and some sections were not high enough. Now, the first phase of the heightening project, involving more than 210,000 cubic meters of earthwork, has been completed.

　　Before July 10, Susong, Wangjiang, and other eight counties along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province had already repaired more than 180,000 meters of wave barrier projects outside the dikes. More than 20,000 laborers and cadres are still working on these county dike sections to reinforce the dike body and renovate dangerous works.

　　The unfinished summer repair projects of dikes in the counties along Dongting Lake in Hunan Province are also being accelerated.

　　After the flood peak of the Yangtze River in early July, counties on both sides of the Jingjiang River in Hubei Province successively held meetings to arrange flood prevention work for the future. The Anqing Special District Flood Control Headquarters in Anhui Province recently dispatched seven inspection teams to various counties along the river to inspect flood control work. On many dike sections, drilling personnel have also been active recently, promptly informing the dike inspectors and repair workers of the hidden dangers they have discovered.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th – Jilin Province has entered the rainy season, and the water levels of the Songhua River and other rivers are rising and falling. The people along the rivers are stepping up flood prevention. Dehui County has organized 20,000 people to go to the dikes. Changchun City, its agencies, troops, etc. have mobilized more than 50,000 people to reinforce the Yitong River dikes, and have raised the 16-kilometer-long river dikes by one meter.

　　On the 18th, nearly 100 mm of rainfall fell near Fanjiatun in Huaide County, and the water level of the Xin'kai River rose sharply. A breach occurred in the dike section of Gaojiatun. The flood prevention army along the river immediately carried out emergency repairs, preventing the land along the river from being affected by the disaster. The water level of Songhua Lake is also rising, and the Fengman Hydropower Station is storing floodwaters and discharging water in a planned manner.

　　In order to strengthen the leadership of flood prevention work, flood control headquarters have been established in 20 counties and 110 flood control stations along the rivers throughout the province.

    湖北安徽吉林等省检查、加固堤防
    新华社武汉21日电　长江两岸堤防经过今年几次洪峰的考验以后，湖北、安徽等省险要堤段上，目前已经展开了广泛的查堤整险活动。
    七月中旬，湖北省荆江大堤上有七千多民工忙着检查堤防和整修险工，他们最近已经完成了三十四公里长的防浪工程和五百多处堤防修补工程。今年新修的洪湖隔堤经过上次洪峰考验，有一部分堤段不够高，现在，那里二十一万多公方的第一期加高工程已经竣工了。
    安徽省沿江的宿松、望江等八县，七月十日以前已经修好了十八万多公尺的堤外挡浪工程，在这些县的堤段上目前仍有两万多民工和干部进行着加固堤身、翻修险工的活动。
    湖南省洞庭湖滨各县未完成的堤防夏修工程现在也在加紧兴修。
    长江七月初的洪峰过后，湖北省荆江两岸各县先后都召开会议，布置了以后的防汛工作。安徽省安庆专区防汛指挥部最近还派出七个检查组到沿江各县检查防汛工作。在许多堤段上，近来钻探人员也活跃起来，他们把发现的大小隐患及时的告诉查堤整险的民工们。
    新华社长春20日电　吉林省进入了雨季，松花江等河流的水位时涨时落，沿河人民正加紧防汛。德惠县已经组织了两万人上堤，长春市各机关、部队等出动五万多人培修伊通河堤防，已经把十六公里长的河堤加高了一公尺。
    十八日，怀德县范家屯附近降雨近一百公厘，新开河水位陡涨，稿家屯段河堤曾发生决口，沿河防汛大军马上进行抢堵，使河边土地免于受灾。松花湖的水位也在上涨，丰满水电站正在蓄洪和有计划的放水。
    为了加强防汛工作的领导，在全省河流沿岸有二十个县建立了防汛指挥部和一百一十处防汛站。
