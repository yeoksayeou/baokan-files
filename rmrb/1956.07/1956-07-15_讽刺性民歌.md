Title: Satirical Folk Songs

Having been away from the countryside for a long time, I rarely hear farmers' songs, and I seldom go to concerts. The music on the radio seems to lack this genre (there is some, but not much that's new). So, when I happened to hear the Zhejiang Folk Music Singing Troupe perform folk songs (recordings), I was so happy that I cried out!

These ten or so short songs, with no known authors, from places like Wenzhou, Jinhua, Yueqing, Chun'an, Jiande, Taishun, and Dongyang, are characterized by a strong sense of life and full of emotion, both in terms of lyrics, melodies, and performances. Most are female solos or choruses. Their voices seem to be springing directly from their hearts. I seem to see a group of them, laughing and active, singing their praises of life in the beautiful nature of the South, with open minds, and expressing their views and evaluations of the world around them without any scruples. The latter category – satirical songs – especially delighted me because I hear them even less often.

How sharp, how delightful, and how concise! How vivid and prominent the character portrayals are (under the condition of extremely short length)! In a song titled "Li Yousong," the girls protested against the deprivation of their companion's right to marital freedom, and even satirized and scolded him mercilessly! One can imagine how embarrassing it would be for Li Yousong of Lijia Village and those "old antiques" like him, under the sound of such songs. Society has changed, but he is still alone, hiding in a dark corner, daydreaming! As a result, the victory is obviously not his, but that of the new generation. Although the ending of the "story" is not described in detail, it can be seen that the old man ultimately ended up "empty-handed," helpless, and had to wipe his beard!

Another equally short Wenzhou folk song satirizes a girl who only loves to dress up and does not work, which is also very interesting.

In addition to satirical folk songs, the programs of the Zhejiang Folk Music Troupe that I heard also included Dongyang's "Leek Song" (singing of love), Jiande's "Tea Picking Song" and Jinhua's "Little Brother Song" (both singing of labor), as well as other folk songs with local scenic spots and customs as their themes, most of which are melodious and have unique flavors.

I heard that they will participate in the performance as part of the National Music Week program. As one of the listeners, I am happy to record my feelings and tell them to musical laymen and enthusiasts like myself.

    讽刺性民歌
    袁水拍
    长久离开农村，听不到农民的歌谣，又很少去听音乐会，而收音机里的音乐又似乎缺少这一门类（有一点，但少新鲜的），于是当我偶然听到浙江民间音乐歌唱团演唱的民歌（录音）的时候，竟高兴得叫起来了！
    来自温州、金华、乐清、淳安、建德、泰顺、东阳等地的十来支没有作者姓名的短歌，无论在歌词、曲调以及演唱方面，都具有生活气息浓厚和情绪饱满的特点。多数是女声的独唱或齐唱。她们的声音好像是直接从心里蹦出来的。我仿佛看见她们欢笑活跃的一群，在南方的艳丽的大自然里，心境开朗地高唱着她们对生活的颂歌，也毫无顾忌地对周围世界表达她们的看法，给予评介。而后面的一类——讽刺歌，由于我自己更少听到，就更加觉得新鲜可喜了。
    多么泼辣，多么痛快，又多么简洁！人物形象刻划得又是何等鲜明、突出（在篇幅极短的条件下）！有一首题为“李有松”，少女们为了自己的一个同伴被剥夺婚姻自主的权利而鸣不平，甚至毫不客气地讽刺起来了，骂起来了！可以设想，那个李家庄的李有松，以及类似李有松的那种“老古董”们，在这样的歌声下，是极其难堪的。社会变了，他却还是一个人孤独地躲在黑暗的角落里做白日梦！结果，胜利的显然不是他，而是新的一代。“故事”结局虽则没有详细叙明，却看得出，那老头儿毕竟落得一个“两手空空”束手无策，只好抹抹自己的胡子！
    另一首同样短小的温州民歌讽刺一个只爱打扮不会劳动的姑娘，也很有情趣。
    除了讽刺性的民歌以外，我所听到的浙江民间音乐团的节目中，还有东阳的“韭菜歌”（歌唱爱情），建德的“采茶歌”和金华的“小弟歌”（两首均歌唱劳动），以及其他以当地名胜、风俗习惯为题材的民歌，也大都是动听的，别有风味的。
    听说它们将要作为全国音乐周的节目参加演出，作为听众之一，我乐于记下我的感想，用来告诉和我一样的音乐的外行和爱好者。
