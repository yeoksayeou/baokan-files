    Zhejiang and Sichuan Discover Two Large Iron Ore Deposits

    This newspaper, Hangzhou, 25th dispatch: An iron ore deposit has been discovered in Lizhu, Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province. Preliminary drilling proves that the ore body exceeds the famous Ma'anshan Iron Mine in Anhui Province. The ore reserves are sufficient for a steel plant with an annual output of 500,000 tons of steel for more than 150 years.

    Predictive work on the Lizhu Iron Mine began in November 1955, and mining began at the same time. To date, more than 100,000 tons of ore have been mined and shipped to Anshan Iron and Steel for smelting. In February of this year, the Nanjing Exploration Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry sent an exploration team to assist in drilling and exploration. Soviet geophysical exploration experts, rare metal experts, non-ferrous metal experts, and mining experts have all visited Lizhu for inspection. At present, the exploration team members are still continuing their exploration.

    In the past, Zhejiang Province was considered a province lacking iron. In recent years, after geological workers' general surveys and explorations, it has been proven that Zhejiang Province not only has abundant reserves and good quality of iron ore and placer iron, but also that mineral deposits are found in more than ten counties including Yuhang, Fuyang, Jiande, Kaihua, Suichang, Yunhe, and Pingyang.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th dispatch: The 531 Team of the Southwest Geological Bureau is exploring a huge iron ore deposit in a certain area of Sichuan. After a year of exploration and expanded peripheral prospecting, it has been confirmed that this iron ore deposit has very large reserves, the iron content of the ore is also high, and it contains other useful components. A large amount of coking coal and some auxiliary raw materials have also been found near the iron ore deposit. These mineral resources are sufficient to meet the needs of establishing a steel base.

    浙江和四川发现两个大铁矿
    本报杭州25日电　浙江省绍兴县漓渚发现了一个铁矿，经初步钻探证明：矿体超过我国有名的安徽省马鞍山铁矿，矿石的储藏量可供一个年产五十万吨钢材的炼钢厂使用一百五十年以上。
    漓渚铁矿从1955年十一月份开始进行预测，同时开始开采，到目前已经采出十万多吨矿石运往鞍钢冶炼。今年二月份，冶金工业部南京勘探公司派出勘探队协助打钻勘探；苏联的物理勘探专家、稀有金属专家、有色金属专家和采矿专家，都先后到漓渚来勘看过。目前，勘察队员们仍在继续进行勘探。
    过去，浙江省被认为是缺铁的省份。几年来，经过地质工作者的普查和勘探，证明浙江省的铁矿和砂铁不仅储量多、质量好，而且矿藏遍及余杭、富阳、建德、开化、遂昌、云和、平阳等十多个县。
    新华社重庆26日电　西南地质局五三一队在四川某地正在探明一个巨大铁矿。经过一年来的勘探和扩大外围普查，证实这个铁矿储量很大，矿石的含铁量也较高，并含有其他有用成分。在铁矿附近还发现大量的炼焦煤和一部分辅助原料。这些矿产资源足够建立一个钢铁基地的需要。
