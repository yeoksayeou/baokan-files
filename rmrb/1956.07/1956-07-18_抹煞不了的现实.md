    Reality Cannot Be Erased
    During a debate in the West German Federal Parliament, German Party member of parliament Schneider questioned Foreign Minister Brentano: Did he know that the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain's Oxford map had already listed the German Democratic Republic as an independent country?
    Brentano replied: He knew and had protested to the British Foreign Office. But unfortunately, the British Foreign Office rejected the protest; Britain also attached the publisher's reply, which said: They make maps based on facts.
    Originally, the existence of the German Democratic Republic on Earth was an undeniable fact. But the leaders of the West German government insisted on imitating ostriches burying their heads in the sand, trying to ignore this fact. They even threatened other countries to bury their heads in the sand like them. For example, the West German government has repeatedly stated that if any country recognizes the German Democratic Republic, the West German government will consider it "unfriendly."
    However, the German Democratic Republic does not cease to exist just because the likes of Adenauer close their eyes. It exists and continues to develop. Nearly one hundred countries already have trade relations with it. After visiting East Germany, "New York Times" reporter Handler also wrote: "East Germany has made great progress in the past two years... the regime there has rapidly consolidated and is becoming more and more powerful."
    Even in West Germany, words like those of this influential retired Colonel Bonin can be heard everywhere: "The German Democratic Republic exists and should therefore be recognized as a reality."
    Now, the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain, unwilling to have its map disgraced in the face of facts, has drawn the current situation of Germany, which should at least remind the Bonn authorities of this simplest truth: reality cannot be erased. (Lin)

### 抹煞不了的现实

    抹煞不了的现实
    在西德联邦议院的一次辩论中，德意志党议员史乃德质问勃伦塔诺外长：是否知道英国皇家地理学院的牛津地图上已经把德意志民主共和国列为一个独立的国家？
    勃伦塔诺回答说：知道，并且已向英国外交部提出抗议。但是可惜的是这个抗议给英国外交部拒绝了；英国并附来出版社的答复，这个答复说：他们制作地图是以事实为根据的。
    本来德意志民主共和国存在在地球上是谁也无法抹掉的事实。偏偏那些西德政府的领导人要学把头埋在沙里的鸵鸟的样，想无视这样的事实。他们甚至还威胁其他国家也要像他们一样把头埋在沙里。例如西德政府曾一再发表声明说，任何国家如果承认德意志民主共和国，西德政府将认为是“不友好的”。
    可是德意志民主共和国并不因阿登纳之流闭起眼睛就不存在。它存在并且不断发展着。已经有将近一百个国家同它发生着贸易的关系。美国“纽约时报”记者汉德勒在访问了民主德国之后也写道：“东德在过去两年内进步很大，……那里的政权已经迅速巩固起来，而且愈来愈强大”。
    就是在西德，像这位有影响的退休上校波宁说的话，也是到处可以听到的：“德意志民主共和国是存在的，因此应该被承认是一个现实”。
    现在，英国皇家地理学院不愿使自己的地图在事实面前丢脸，画出了德国的现状，这多少应该提醒波恩当局这个最简单的真理：现实是抹煞不了的。　　（林）
