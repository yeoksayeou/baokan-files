    "Inside Story"
    Zhou Lin
    A book claiming to be about the inside story of the Eisenhower administration has recently been published in the United States. The author of this book is Donovan, a Washington correspondent for the "New York Herald Tribune." In this book, he directly or indirectly cites records and secret materials from dozens of U.S. government cabinet meetings and other high-level meetings presided over by the President.
    The publication of Donovan's "Eisenhower: The Inside Story" comes on the eve of the Democratic and Republican Party conventions to decide presidential candidates. It has attracted widespread attention and debate.
    According to a report by the Associated Press, one of the important contents of the book is that Eisenhower has always advocated that the United States should open the door to recognizing China. Donovan cited official records to prove that Eisenhower also advocated that the United States should trade with China.
    There is no doubt that the vast majority of American voters demand to establish normal relations and trade with China.
    However, there is a great distance between the policy pursued by the U.S. government and what this American author wants to make his readers believe. Ten months have passed since the talks between China and the United States in Geneva reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians from both sides. Despite China's repeated efforts, no progress has been made due to the U.S. procrastination.
    On June 28, Premier Zhou announced in his speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress that China is willing to coexist peacefully with all countries, including the United States, and does not build its friendly relations with some countries on the basis of excluding other countries.
    However, the U.S. government not only expressed indifference to China's friendly intentions, but also expressed "regret" over the realistic actions of independent countries such as Egypt and Syria in recognizing the People's Republic of China, and tried to obstruct other countries from being friendly with China.
    Recently, there have been two more events that are vastly different from the conciliatory intentions of the U.S. government depicted by Donovan: In the newly discussed foreign aid appropriation bill in Congress, the United States has increased its military assistance to Taiwan. And after Premier Zhou Enlai proposed that the Chinese government is willing to negotiate with the Taiwan authorities on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the U.S. government suddenly announced that U.S. Vice President Nixon will visit Taiwan on the 7th of this month. These things cannot help but give people the feeling that the United States does not want to ease the tension in the Taiwan region, but is trying to maintain the tension in this region; it does not want to improve relations between China and the United States, but continues to maintain hostility towards China.
    Therefore, people have reason to believe that the so-called "inside story" is more like a campaign booklet.

    “内幕故事”
    周林
    美国最近出版了一本据说是有关艾森豪威尔政府内幕故事的书。这本书的作者是“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿的记者杜诺万。在这本书中，他直接地或间接地引证了几十次美国政府内阁会议和总统主持的其他高级会议的记录和秘密材料。
    杜诺万所著的“艾森豪威尔：内幕故事”这本书的发表，正当民主党和共和党召开决定总统候选人的党代表大会的前夕。它引起了很广泛的注意和争论。
    根据合众社的报道，这本书的重要内容之一就是说艾森豪威尔一直主张美国应该为承认中国打开大门。杜诺万引证了官方的记录来证明艾森豪威尔还主张美国应该和中国进行贸易。
    毫无疑问，广大的美国选民是要求和中国建立正常的关系并进行贸易的。
    但是，美国政府所奉行的政策和这位美国作者要使他的读者相信的事情之间有着很大的距离。中美两国在日内瓦所举行的会谈就双方平民回国问题达成协议之后，已经十个月了。尽管中国方面作了多次的努力，由于美国的拖延，还未能取得进展。
    六月二十八日，周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言中宣布：我国愿意同一切国家和平共处，包括美国在内，而且不把我国同某些国家的友好关系建筑在排斥另外一些国家的基础之上。
    但是美国政府不仅对我国这种友好意愿表示冷淡，还对埃及、叙利亚等独立国家承认中华人民共和国的现实行动表示“遗憾”，并且竭力阻挠其他国家同我国友好。
    最近还有两件事是和杜诺万所描绘的美国政府和解的意愿大相径庭的：在国会新近讨论的援外拨款法案中，美国又增加了它对台湾的军事援助。而在周恩来总理提出中国政府愿意和台湾当局协商和平解放台湾的问题之后，美国政府突然宣布美国副总统尼克松要在本月七日赴台湾访问。这些事情使人不能不产生这样的感觉：美国并不想缓和台湾地区的紧张局势，而是竭力想要保持这个地区的紧张局势；并不想改善中美两国的关系，而是继续对我国保持敌对。
    因此，人们有理由认为，所谓“内幕故事”，更像是一种竞选的小册子。
