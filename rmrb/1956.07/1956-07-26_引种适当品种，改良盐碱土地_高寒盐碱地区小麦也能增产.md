Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 24th. The Early Yang wheat, which was test-planted in the cold Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi Province this year, has yielded a bumper harvest. The Early Yang wheat test-planted by two farms and twelve agricultural production cooperatives in four counties including Luochuan, Huangling, and Yijun, averaged over 200 jin per mu, with the highest reaching over 320 jin.

Early Yang wheat is an excellent variety introduced from the United States by Beijing Agricultural University. This variety is cold-resistant, drought-resistant, has strong resistance to stripe rust, and has a high yield. The climate in the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi is relatively cold and the frost period is long, so wheat yields have always been low. The agricultural leadership organs of Shaanxi Province began to introduce Early Yang wheat seeds last year for demonstration in the four counties of Fu County, Luochuan, Huangling, and Yijun, and the results were good. Now, local farmers are actively reserving Early Yang wheat seeds and requesting exchanges. In addition to notifying the county farms and agricultural cooperatives that carried out the trial planting to retain all the Early Yang wheat seeds, the agricultural leadership organs of Shaanxi Province are also preparing to purchase another 200,000 jin from Hebei Province in order to expand planting this autumn.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 24th. The State-owned Lingwu Farm in Gansu Province is currently harvesting spring wheat planted on two saline-alkali lands. This is the sixth year that the Lingwu Farm has harvested such wheat.

One piece of land is over 2,900 mu, and the other is over 500 mu. The variety, cultivation conditions, and fertilization amount of these two pieces of land are the same, only the degree of salinity and alkalinity is different. The former has been carefully improved for salinity and alkalinity, and the estimated yield per mu can reach more than 280 jin; the latter is still heavily saline-alkali, and the estimated yield per mu is at most 150 jin.

The Lingwu Farm has basically mastered the changing patterns of salinity and alkalinity in the soil. In order to fight against the salinity and alkalinity in the land, the farm has vigorously dug two east-west drainage canals, and around the canals, they have dug thousands of drainage ditches to form a strong drainage network. Relying on this drainage network, they used the method of planting rice to wash away the salt and alkali on the ground; at the same time, they deepened the drainage ditches year by year to lower the groundwater level, so that the underground salt and alkali would not rise.

As more and more saline-alkali land is being conquered, the planting area of the Lingwu Farm is also expanding, and the yields of the main food crops, rice and wheat, are increasing rapidly year by year. Compared with 1956 and 1951, the rice area has expanded 34 times, and the wheat area has expanded 25 times. The unit area yield of rice and wheat in 1955 increased by about one time compared with 1951.

The Lingwu Farm is one of the earliest mechanical farms established in Gansu Province. Because the land on this farm is severely saline-alkali, hundreds and thousands of mu are short of seedlings and die every year, which is one of the main reasons for the low crop yields of this farm over the years. Wang Qizhen, the deputy director of the farm, told reporters that as long as there is a way to overcome the salinity and alkalinity of the land, the development of the Lingwu Farm will make great strides in the future!

    引种适当品种，改良盐碱土地
    高寒盐碱地区小麦也能增产
    新华社西安24日电　陕西省今年在寒冷的陕北黄土高原上试种的早洋麦获得丰收。洛川、黄陵、宜君等四县的两个农场和十二个农业生产合作社试种的早洋麦，平均每亩收获二百多斤，最高的达到三百二十多斤。
    早洋麦是北京农业大学从美国引进来的一种优良品种。这种麦种耐寒、耐旱，抗条锈病力强，产量高。陕北黄土高原气候比较寒冷，霜期较长，一向小麦产量不高。陕西省的农业领导机关从去年开始把早洋麦种引进来，在鄜县、洛川、黄陵和宜君四县进行示范，结果良好。现在，当地农民都在积极预留早洋麦种和要求调换。陕西省农业领导机关除通知试种的县农场和农业社把全部早洋麦种保留下来外，并准备再从河北省采购二十万斤，以便在今年秋季扩大种植。
    新华社兰州24日电　甘肃省国营灵武农场这几天正在收割种植在两块盐碱化土地上的春小麦。这是灵武农场第六年收割这样的麦子了。
    这两块麦子，一块两千九百多亩，另一块五百多亩。这两块地的品种、耕作条件和施肥量都同，只有盐碱程度不同。前一块认真进行过盐碱改良，预计每亩产量可达二百八十斤以上；后一块盐碱仍重，预计每亩产量最多一百五十斤。
    灵武农场已基本上掌握了土地上盐碱的变化规律。这个农场为了和土地上的盐碱作斗争，大力挖成了东西两条排水干沟，围绕干沟又挖成千百条排水支沟，组成强大的排水网。依靠这个排水网，他们一面采取种水稻洗盐碱的方法，将地面盐碱冲洗出去；一面逐年加深排水沟，降低地下水位，使地下盐碱不致上升。
    随着盐碱化土地越来越多的被征服，灵武农场的播种面积也越来越扩大，主要粮食作物水稻和小麦的产量逐年急剧上升。以1956年和1951年比较，水稻面积扩大三十四倍，小麦扩大二十五倍。水稻和小麦1955年的单位面积产量比1951年增加了约一倍。
    灵武农场是甘肃省最早建立的一个机械农场，因这个场土地盐碱严重，每年总有成百上千亩缺苗死苗，是造成这个场历年作物产量低的主要原因之一。这个农场的副场长王起祯对记者说，只要有了克服土地盐碱化的办法，今后灵武农场发展将会大踏步前进！
