    Why Can't a Tens of Thousands of Yuan Irrigation Project Be Used?

    The Muma River Pumping Irrigation Project in Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, was surveyed and designed by the Hanzhong Water Conservancy Work Team and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau last August and approved by the province. This project, in addition to irrigating existing paddy fields, can also irrigate 8,500 mu of newly opened paddy fields. In November of last year, we suddenly received a telegram from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau: the south main canal (the pumping project is divided into north and south main canals) was to be stopped, and the north main canal was to be rushed to completion. We then concentrated our efforts and completed the north main canal project on schedule. Now, 55,482 yuan has been spent, 70 mu of seedlings have been destroyed due to land occupation, and 30,000 workdays of labor have been used. The farmers in the irrigated area were convinced that they could use the pumping irrigation project to massively convert to paddy fields. They sold the cotton seeds they had originally kept, bought back a large number of rice seeds, actively soaked the seeds and cultivated seedlings, preparing for transplanting. However, in early April, we suddenly received a telephone notice from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau saying that the gasifier on the ordered gas engine had failed in the factory's trial production and could not be delivered on time, and we were told to notify the farmers to plant dry land crops as in previous years. We had no choice but to mobilize the farmers to take out the soaked grain seeds and lend money to the farmers to buy back cotton seeds. We also reflected this situation to the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau by telegram and telephone. But soon, we received another telegram from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, saying that they had negotiated with the factory to use another type of gas engine to replace the originally ordered gas engine, and the machine would be delivered soon, asking us to prepare for installation. In order to ensure timely installation and water release, we specially sent cadres to the Wuhan Power Plant (gas engine manufacturer) to negotiate and transport back the machine, but we were still short of two water pumps, one ground shaft, and clutches, and other parts. We urged the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau at the end of April, and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau said that they would be able to leave the factory in May. However, by the beginning of May, there was still no news. We repeatedly urged them, and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau replied that they would be able to leave the factory at the end of May. At this time, we sent cadres to the Shanghai Water Pump Factory to inquire, but there was no result. When we asked the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau again, the cadres of the Water Conservancy Bureau said that they would be able to leave the factory in early June. In mid-June, Comrade Guo of the Water Conservancy Section of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau replied that he did not know when they would be able to leave the factory. After many twists and turns, it was not until the beginning of July that the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau told us that the factories in Xi'an were too busy to process these parts, and asked us to find other solutions.

    Because the machine cannot be installed and the irrigation project cannot be used, it has caused great dissatisfaction among the masses, and the resulting losses are irreparable. Who should be responsible for these serious losses suffered by the farmers? We request the Shaanxi Provincial Supervisory Department to conduct an inspection and handle this matter.

### 为什么花了几万元的灌溉工程用不上

    为什么花了几万元的灌溉工程用不上
    陕西省西乡县牧马河抽水灌溉工程是去年八月由汉中水利工作队和省水利局勘查设计、经省批准的，去年十一月开始动工。这项工程除灌溉原有水田外，还可灌溉新开的八千五百亩水田。今年二月，忽然接到省水利局电示：南干渠（抽水工程分南北两干渠）停修，赶修北干渠。我们便集中力量按期完成了北干渠的工程。现在已经花去55，482元，因为占用土地而毁去青苗七十亩，用民工三万个。灌区农民满以为可以利用抽水灌溉工程大量改种水田了，他们把原留的棉种出卖，买回大量稻谷种子，积极泡种育秧，准备插种。可是，四月初，我们忽接省水利局来电话通知说，所订煤汽机上的煤气炉在厂方试制失败，不能按时交货，叫通知农民仍和往年一样种旱地。我们只得动员农民将已泡的谷种捞出，同时又贷款给农民买回棉种。我们并且用电报电话把这个情况反映给省水利局。但不久，又接省水利局电示，说已和厂方商妥，用另外一种煤气机代替原来订制的煤气机，机器不日即运到，要我们准备安装。为了保证及时安装放水，我们专派干部赶赴武汉动力厂（煤气机制造厂）协商，运回了机器，但是还缺水泵两部、地轴一个和离合器等机件。我们在四月底催促省水利局，省水利局说，五月份才能出厂。但是到了五月初旬，还不见音信。我们再三催促，省水利局又答复说，五月底才能出厂。这时我们又派干部亲赴上海水泵制造厂询问，也没有结果。再问省水利局，水利局的干部说，六月初才能出厂。六月中旬，省水利局水利科郭同志又答复说，不知啥时才能出厂。几经周折，直到七月初省水利局才告诉我们西安各工厂太忙，不能加工这些零件，叫我们另想办法。
    由于机器安装不上，灌溉工程不能使用，引起群众极大不满，造成的损失是不可弥补的。农民遭受的这些严重的损失究竟应由谁负责？我们要求陕西省监察厅对这件事进行检查处理。
