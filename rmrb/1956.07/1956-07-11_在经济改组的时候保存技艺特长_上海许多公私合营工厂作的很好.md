    Preserving Technical Skills During Economic Reorganization
    Shanghai Joint State-Private Factories Are Doing Well
    (Dispatch from our Shanghai office) Many newly established joint state-private factories in Shanghai that produce special handicrafts and unique products are allowed to maintain independent production by specialized companies during economic reorganization, so as to utilize their technical expertise.
    The Shuanglong Leather Factory produces "golden leather," which is specifically used for decorating high-heeled leather shoes, and is sprayed with elegant gold patterns, making it very popular with foreign customers. The Dazhen Scientific Equipment Factory produces surgical sutures made of sheep intestines, which are used for suturing incisions on patients. These two special products are only produced by these two factories in Shanghai. Although they have a small workforce, their craftsmanship is high, so the specialized companies have made them independent factories. The Shixiangsheng, Shenxin, Guoguang, and four other leather factories all produce embroidered and painted leather goods, which are exquisite and beautiful. In the past, they were managed by central factories that produced many different products. Now, based on the similarity of their products, they have all been grouped into one central factory, which facilitates exchange and improvement of craftsmanship. The Xiling Seal Engravers, with only three employees, is also allowed to produce independently because of its famous and valuable seal paste.

    在经济改组的时候保存技艺特长
    上海许多公私合营工厂作的很好
    本报上海电　上海许多生产特种工艺品和特殊产品的新公私合营工厂，在经济改组的时候，专业公司仍让它们独立生产，发挥技艺特长。
    双龙皮件厂生产的金革，是专门装饰高跟皮鞋的，上面喷上图案雅致的金花，很受国外顾客的欢迎。大震科学器材厂生产的羊肠线，是给病人缝合刀口用的。这两种特殊产品，上海只有这两家工厂生产，他们人数少，但工艺水平高，专业公司都把它们分别作独立厂。史祥生、申新、国光等七家皮件厂，都是生产绣花和描花皮件的，产品精巧美丽。过去它们分别由许多不同产品的中心厂管理，现在，按产品相同全部划分在一个中心厂内，这样就更便于交流和提高工艺了。只有三个从业人员的西冷印社，因为它生产的印泥名贵，也让它独立生产。
