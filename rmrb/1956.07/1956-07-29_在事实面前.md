    In the Face of Facts
    Jia Fang
    On July 21st, when Zhang Guojing, a confessed dispatched special agent, received the letter of exemption from prosecution issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, it felt as if these few pages weighed a thousand pounds. He trembled with excitement, and after a long while, tears filled his eyes as he said, "I deserve to die a thousand times. The government's lenient treatment of me is my rebirth!" For the first time in more than half a year, he walked on the street with peace of mind, no longer nervously observing whether anyone was paying attention to him.

            Although He Was Very Careful
    Zhang Guojing was a man with serious crimes and had wholeheartedly followed the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He used to be the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Liaoyang Municipal Party Department. After liberation, he continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities and, in 1950, fled to Hong Kong to establish relations with the US-Chiang secret service. At the end of December 1955, he accepted the assignment from the secret service and came to Beijing as a "Special Commissioner of North China" and "Commissioner."

    After Zhang Guojing sneaked into Beijing, he went to find his aunt. His aunt worked as a nanny in the home of a cadre. When Zhang Guojing met Liang Ruizhen, the mistress of the house, he used all the new terms he knew to show his activeness and progress, and even said, "I had to beg for food in Hong Kong and did hard labor. My back was sunburned and peeled."

    Zhang Guojing was very careful. Later, when he came to see his aunt, he changed into a blue cloth uniform and cloth shoes, constantly complaining about poverty in front of this family. But he still slipped up. Liang Ruizhen later found out that he had brought three watches from Hong Kong, and he often smoked "President" cigarettes and had his clothes cleaned outside. These things raised questions in her mind.

    One day, the postman came and shouted at the door, "A letter for the Liang family!" A cadre's family member in the same courtyard happened to be at the door, took it and saw that it was a remittance sent from Hong Kong "care of Liang Ruizhen." She thought, "The Liang family has no relatives in Hong Kong!" She told Liang Ruizhen about this. Upon asking, it turned out that the money was remitted to Zhang Guojing. Zhang Guojing explained that he had saved some money in Hong Kong, and this was remitted by a friend. This raised another question.

    Liang Ruizhen told the comrades at the local police station all these things.

            An Invisible Encirclement
    The tasks Zhang Guojing received in Hong Kong were: to collect intelligence, establish a radio station, develop an organization, and carry out defection activities. When he was in a hotel in Hong Kong, he had his own plans: who to contact, who to develop. After arriving in Beijing, he wanted to contact former reactionary party members. One day, he happened to meet one of them on the street, but this person was already a teacher in a middle school and even asked him where he had been. He thought, "This kind of person is likely to have already leaned towards the Communist Party," so he didn't even dare to tell him his address and parted ways. He also wanted to make some tentative advances to his cousin, who was attending university in Beijing, but she was attending university with a scholarship and was an unmarried girl. If she had a Communist Party lover, it would be even easier to cause problems. He quickly dismissed this idea.

    He originally wanted to use some capital to start a business and cover himself up, but as soon as he settled down, the upsurge of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce came, and this plan was difficult to realize. Later, he made up a false resume and registered with the police station to find a job. He came back to realize that he had written his real name, which he used in Northeast China, on this false resume. Would this loophole expose his crimes of engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in Northeast China before 1950? He felt like he was in an invisible encirclement every day, constantly worrying that someone was paying attention to him. When strangers walked into his courtyard, he couldn't help but feel terrified.

        The People's World is Secure
    He didn't dare to go to Northeast China, but he was very worried about his wife and children. So he used his cousin's name to write a letter to his wife, asking about the situation at home.

    In mid-May, his eighteen-year-old daughter came to see him from Northeast China. Zhang Guojing couldn't hide his surprise, carefully looking at his daughter, who had a rosy complexion and was neatly dressed.

    His daughter told him in detail about the family affairs. She told him that her eldest younger brother was in middle school and was applying to join the Communist Youth League; the younger brother was also in school and had already worn the red scarf; his third aunt was working in a factory; only his mother was sick and couldn't get out of bed. She herself had also entered a factory last year. The government provided assistance, the factory provided subsidies, and there were scholarships for her younger brother to go to school, and the family's life was sufficient to maintain.

    Speaking of her younger brother, she said: The year before last, no one in the family was earning money, and life was very difficult, relying on government relief to live on. However, one time the younger brother suddenly got a dangerous "intestinal obstruction" and was about to die. There was no time to borrow money temporarily, so she ran to the street office overnight to find a way. The comrades in the office didn't ask any questions and said: Saving people is the most important thing! They rushed the younger brother to the hospital, and the government treated him for free. The younger brother's life was saved.

    Zhang Guojing listened blankly, tears streaming down his face. When he was in Hong Kong, he was worried about whether his children had put on cotton clothes when winter came; when spring came, he was worried about whether his children would be able to change their clothes for the season. He once thought that the children might be living on the streets. But the fact was not like this at all. They were living very well. They had encountered difficulties, but who helped them when they were in the most difficulty? Who saved his son's life? It was the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    He thought: Why does the People's Government still take care of the families of people who have committed crimes and fled? In the past, he was accustomed to answering in one way: "This is just something the Communist Party is doing for show." But, who are these things in his own family being done for show?

    He had been to Tianqiao, wanting to find some of the evils and poverty left over from the old society; but, this was not the Tianqiao of the past! Before his eyes was a scene of prosperity. When Beijing industrialists and businessmen celebrated the victory of socialist transformation, he followed the marching crowd, seeing gongs and drums everywhere, and capitalists rejoicing. Who was the Communist Party doing all this for show for? He seemed to have an answer to this question now, that is: everyone says the Communist Party is good, everyone follows the Communist Party, the people's world is secure!

            Which Path to Take?
    From then on, he fell into serious conflict.

    Not long ago, when he saw an article in the newspaper about the special agent Zhang Yi abandoning the dark and turning to the light, he still comforted himself by thinking, "This is a trap of the Communist Party!" Now, how much he wished this were true! He thought, "If Zhang Yi's crimes can be treated leniently, my crimes can also be treated leniently." But, after thinking about it carefully, it wouldn't work. He felt that he was the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Department, a dispatched special agent, which was similar to Zhang Yi. However, after liberation, he also organized the "Northeast Anti-Russian and Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps"; after fleeing to Hong Kong in 1950, he returned to arrange underground activities; recruited nearly twenty special agents to sneak into the mainland; and after being dispatched back, he sent four pieces of intelligence... Each time he counted a crime, his heart sank, and he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. At this time, he thought again: he was directly dispatched by the secret service, without going through an introduction, and had always been very careful in Beijing, the Communist Party might not be able to find out... This fluke mentality often made him feel temporarily stable. However, other facts often broke this stability.

    At this time, his wife also kept writing letters. One letter said: After you left, the family "has had a difficult life, lacking food and clothing, a bunch of ignorant children, suffering from hunger and cold... If it weren't for the government today, our children and adults would have been begging on the streets long ago." Then she advised him: "Be frank and clear as water, without any shadows, perform meritorious service to atone for your crimes, quickly confess clearly,... return home to reunite, please take on family responsibilities... relieve your long-suffering wife of her heavy burden." Every time he received a letter from home, the idea of confessing moved him. He walked to the police station several times, hesitating and unable to make up his mind. Once, he had already walked into the police station, but in the end, he only stuttered and talked about some unimportant things. He told the head of the police station that he would write a written statement when he got back, but after going back, he would write a little and then stop. He thought, if he didn't talk, he might be able to hide it... But, what if he was found out? His biggest concern was: the crimes were too big and he wouldn't get lenient treatment. He nervously and repeatedly thought and struggled, his brain almost exploding. Should he flee back to Hong Kong again? But, now it seemed that the so-called "status" and "guarantee of life for the rest of his life" were unreliable, and he wouldn't last long in Taiwan either. Moreover, what would his wife, who was ill in bed, say? What would his children say? A feeling of shame welled up in his heart...

          He Decided to Confess
    On June 4th, his cousin came to see him. He said to her with a pale face and incoherent words, "I'm going to confess completely, maybe this time I leave, we'll never see each other again." Seeing that he was going to confess, his cousin repeatedly dispelled his worries and fears, telling him: The People's Government says one is one, and two is two, a complete confession will surely receive lenient treatment. She also accompanied him to the police station.

    That night, the police station received him.

    When he came face-to-face with the public security cadres and saw their sincere attitude of patiently explaining the policies, he truly believed that a complete confession would receive lenient treatment.

    And that was exactly the case.

    Recently, Zhang Guojing said to others, "I feel like I've changed!" Yes, this is a rebirth change, a new beginning in life.

    在事实面前  
    贾方
    七月二十一日，当坦白自首了的派遣特务分子张国镜接到北京市人民检察院发给的免予起诉书的时候，好像这几页纸有着千斤重，他激动得双手发抖，半晌才泪流满面地说：“我是死有余辜的呀，政府对我的宽大处理，就是我的再生！”半年多来，他第一次安心地在大街上走路，不再提心吊胆地观察是不是有人在注意他了。
            虽然他很小心
    张国镜是一个罪恶严重而且曾经死心地跟着蒋介石集团走的人。他过去是国民党辽阳市党部书记长 ，解放后继续进行反革命活动，并且在1950年逃到香港同美蒋特务机关建立关系。1955年12月底，他接受特务机关的派遣，以“华北区特派员”和“专员”的身份，来到了北京。
    张国镜潜入北京之后，就去找他的姑母。他的姑母在一个机关干部家里当保姆。张国镜和这家女主人梁瑞珍见面的时候，就搬出一套他所知道的新名词，表示自己的积极和进步；还说什么：“我在香港要过饭吃，做过苦工，脊背都晒得脱皮了。”
    张国镜是很小心的。以后，他来看姑母的时候，换上了一身蓝布制服和布鞋，不断地在这家人面前喊穷。可是他还是露出了马脚，梁瑞珍后来知道，他从香港带来了三块手表，而且经常抽大前门烟，衣服还拿到外面请人去洗。这些，在她心里都画了问号。
    一天，邮递员来了，在门口喊了一声：“梁家的信！”同院的一位干部家属恰巧在门口，顺手接过来一看，是从香港寄出的由“梁瑞珍转”的汇款。她心想：“梁家在香港没有亲戚呀！”她把这件事给梁瑞珍说了。一问，原来钱是汇给张国镜的。张国镜这样解释：他在香港还存了一点钱，这是朋友汇来的。这又是一个问号。
    梁瑞珍把这些都向公安派出所的同志谈了。
            无形的包围
    张国镜在香港接受的任务是：搜集情报，建立电台，发展组织，进行策反。他在香港旅馆的时候有过自己的计划：联络谁、发展谁。到了北京，他想跟过去认识的反动党团人员联系。一天，恰巧在街上碰到其中的一个，但是，这人已经是某中学的教员了，而且还反问他一向在哪里。他想：“这样的人很可能已经倾向共产党了”，于是连自己的地址也没敢谈就分手了。他也想对在北京上大学的表妹做些试探活动，但是，她是领着助学金上了大学的，而且又是未婚的女孩子，要是有一个共产党员的爱人，就更容易出问题了。他很快地打消了这个主意。
    他本想拿出些资本做个买卖，把自己掩护起来，可是，刚住下来，私营工商业的社会主义改造高潮来了，这个计划不好实现。后来，他编了一套假履历，向派出所登记找职业。回来他才想起他在这个假履历上写了在东北用过的真名字。这个漏洞会不会暴露自己1950年以前在东北曾经进行的反革命活动的罪行呢？他感觉到每天都像处在一个无形的包围里，时刻担心有人注意他。生人走进他住的院子，他就禁不住心惊肉跳。
        人民的天下坐定了
    他不敢去东北，可是万分挂念自己的妻子和孩子。于是他冒用表妹的名义，给妻子写了一封信，探问家里的情形。
    五月中旬，他的十八岁的女儿从东北看望他来了。张国镜掩盖不住自己的惊异，仔细打量着面色红润、穿著整齐的女儿。
    他的女儿详细地讲着家常。她告诉他说，她的大弟弟上中学了，正在申请参加青年团；小弟弟也上学了，已经带上了红领巾；三姨在工厂里做工；就是妈妈病了，起不了床。她自己去年也进了工厂。政府有照顾，工厂有补助，弟弟上学也有助学金，家里的生活足够维持。
    谈到她的小弟弟，她说：前年，家里还没人挣钱，生活还很困难，靠政府的救济过日子。可是，有一次小弟弟忽然得了危险的“肠结绳”病，眼看就要死了，临时借钱也来不及，她连夜跑到街道办事处想办法，办事处的同志二话没问，说：救人要紧！就赶忙把弟弟送到医院，由政府免费医治。小弟弟这条命救下来了。
    张国镜楞楞地听着，眼泪顺着脸扑簌簌地往下流。在香港的时候，一到冬天，他就挂念着孩子们是不是穿上了棉衣；春天到了，就挂念着孩子们是不是会换不了季。他曾经想到孩子们也许会流落街头。可是，事实完全不是这样，他们在很好地生活着。他们曾经遇到过困难，但是，是谁在他们最困难的时候帮助了他们呢？是谁把他儿子救活了呢？是共产党和人民政府。
    他想：为什么人民政府对有罪恶而且逃跑的人的家属还这样照顾呢？过去，他习惯用一种方式回答：“这不过是共产党做给人看的。”可是，自己家里的这些事情，又是做给谁看的呢？
    他到过天桥，满想在这儿总可以发现一些过去旧社会遗留下来的罪恶和贫困的现象吧；可是，这那是过去的天桥了呵！眼前是一片繁荣气象。北京工商业者庆祝社会主义改造胜利的时候，他跟着游行队伍走，看见到处敲锣打鼓，资本家欢天喜地。这一切，又是共产党做给谁看的呢？这个问题，现在他似乎有了一个答案，那就是：人人都说共产党好，人人都跟着共产党走，人民的天下坐定了！
            走哪条路？
    从此，他陷入严重的矛盾中。
    不久前，他看到报纸上登了关于特务分子张毅弃暗投明的文章的时候，还自宽自解地想：“这是共产党的圈套吧！”现在，他又多么希望着这是真的呢！”他想：“张毅的罪行能宽大，我的罪行也可以宽大。”可是，细一想又不行。他觉得：自己是国民党的市党部书记长，是派遣特务，这跟张毅差不多。可是，解放后自己还组织过“东北抗俄反共救国团”；1950年逃到香港后又回来布置过潜伏活动；招募了将近二十名特务潜入大陆；自己被派遣回来以后又发了四份情报……。他数一条罪行，心里沉一下，不由得出了满头大汗。这时候，他又想：自己是直接由特务机关派遣来的，没有经过介绍，来到北京一向又很小心谨慎，共产党不一定能查出来……。这种侥幸心理常常使他暂时安定一下。然而，另外一些事实又常常打破这种安定。
    正在这时候，他的妻子也不断地来信。有一封信里说：你走后，家里“生活困难，少吃无穿，一堆无知的孩子，饥寒交迫……要非今日政府，我们孩子大人，早流落街头乞讨了。”接着劝他：“坦白一清如水，一点黑影无有，立功赎罪，急速交代清楚，……回家团聚，请您负起家庭责任……使你久病的妻子放下重担。”他每接到一次家信，坦白的念头就动一下。他几次走到派出所门前，左思右想拿不定主意。有一次，他已经走进派出所了，但结果只吞吞吐吐地谈了点不关紧要的事。他向派出所长说，回去再写书面材料，但是回去以后，写一点就停下来。他想，如果自己不谈，也可能隐藏下去的……。可是，万一被查出来怎么办呢？他最大的顾虑就是：罪行太大，得不到宽大处理。他紧张地、反复地思索着、斗争着，脑子几乎要爆炸了。再逃回香港么？可是，现在看来，所谓“地位”“后半生的生活保证”是靠不住的，到台湾也是混不长的。而且，卧病在床的妻子会说什么？孩子们会说什么？一种感到自己可耻的念头涌上心来……。
          他决心坦白了
    六月四日，他的表妹来看他。他面色惨白，前言不搭后语地向她说：“我要彻底坦白了，也许这次走了，咱们再见不到面了。”表妹看到他要交代问题，就一再解除他的顾虑和畏惧，告诉他：人民政府说一是一，说二是二，坦白彻底一定会得到宽大处理。她还陪着他到了派出所。
    这天晚上，派出所接待了他。
    当他面对面地接触到公安干部，看到他们耐心解释政策的诚恳的态度的时候，他真正相信了坦白彻底一定会得到宽大处理。
    事实也正是这样。
    最近，张国镜对别人说：“我觉得自己变了！”是的，这是一个再生的变化，一个从新做人的开始。
