    My Mother Came to China
    Yanjing Kimi
    While diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet returned to normal, my 74-year-old adoptive mother, Iwai Mutsumi, came to China from Japan to reunite with our family. I express my deep gratitude to the Chinese government, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Japanese friends who assisted us.
    I was born in a village in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. When I was six years old, my parents gave me to a friend named Iwai as an adopted daughter because they had no children. After graduating from junior college, I worked as a middle school teacher for three and a half years. At that time, I met my beloved Yan Chunzhi—he was studying in Japan at the time. In 1944, I came to China and married him, and I have lived in China ever since. Now, my husband works as an engineer at Benxi Iron and Steel Company. We have two daughters and a son, and we live a happy and harmonious family life.
    In 1952, my adoptive father passed away in Japan. My elderly adoptive mother lived a hard life alone, and I often worried about her. In the autumn of 1953, a group of Japanese nationals returned to their country. I entrusted one of them, who was returning to Fukushima Prefecture, to visit my adoptive mother and tell her about our happy life after liberation. At the end of December of that year, my adoptive mother wrote to me saying that she wanted to come to China to live with us. Afterwards, she kept writing about it. However, since diplomatic relations between China and Japan had not yet been restored, and the issue of visits between relatives of nationals of the two countries had not been resolved, my elderly mother encountered many difficulties in leaving Japan to come to China.
    In 1954, I contacted the Foreign Affairs Office of the Liaoning Provincial People's Government about this matter. Later, I received a reply saying that because China and Japan had not yet restored diplomatic relations, the Liaoning Provincial People's Government could not handle this matter and asked me to apply to the central government. Later, I wrote to the Chinese Red Cross, inquiring about the procedures for applying for my adoptive mother's entry into the country, and asked for their assistance. With their help, I received an entry permit for my adoptive mother, Iwai Mutsumi, issued by the Chinese government.
    However, what should I do about my elderly mother's departure procedures in Japan? I wrote again to Ms. Kamichika Ichiko, who had led a Japanese women's delegation to China, asking for her assistance. Ms. Kamichika was a stranger to us, but she enthusiastically helped us. She wrote to us saying that the Japanese government required us to send the entry permit issued by the Chinese government and to have my husband issue a guarantee that he would bear the insufficient travel expenses and all expenses during her stay in China. This guarantee had to be certified by the Chinese government authorities. With these documents, the Japanese government could issue my adoptive mother an exit permit. This spring, I sent the entry permit and the guarantee written by my husband, Yan Chunzhi, along with a letter of certification from the Benxi Municipal People's Committee Civil Affairs Bureau. In this way, Ms. Kamichika Ichiko helped my mother complete the departure procedures. In May of this year, my mother, whom I had been separated from for thirteen years, finally came to China and met us. This brought great joy to our family.
    Although our current lifestyle is not much different from that of the Japanese, my mother still feels a little unaccustomed because she is getting old. Therefore, I want to change our lives as much as possible so that she can adapt.
    When my mother was in Japan, she lived a long period of lonely life without support. After coming to China, her whole heart settled down, and she was very happy all day long. Although my children cannot communicate with my mother in words, they always share the fruits and candies they get with my mother. My nine-year-old eldest daughter insists on sleeping with my mother. My husband also often brings my mother some gifts when he comes home from the street. My mother is often so happy that she sheds tears for this warm feeling.
    After my mother came here, the staff members of the street and the neighbors came to welcome her. Everyone was happy for my hunchbacked, white-haired old mother to come here from a distant place and be with me. Because my mother came too hastily, she was in a hurry and did not have time to buy the gifts she had planned to buy for us. She had to buy some snacks in Kobe and bring them. My mother always seemed to feel sorry about this. However, my cousins and the friends who knew about my mother's coming to China from Japanese newspapers brought me all kinds of gifts. What made me happiest was that they wrote me many letters. My husband's former classmates and colleagues, my former friends, and my students all entrusted my mother to bring their letters and photos. They knew that I was healthy and happy, and they also knew that our mother and daughter's wish could be realized, and my mother could come to China, so everyone was happy for me.
    From my mother's conversations and the letters I received, I learned that the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan is the wish of the Japanese people. If diplomatic relations between the two countries are adjusted and free exchanges are possible, they would all very much like to come to China to see. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that the Chinese Red Cross, the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council expressed in the Tianjin meeting communique that they would strive to open up the road for free exchanges between nationals of China and Japan. The Chinese side has also allowed Japanese women who are married to Chinese people in China to go to Japan to visit relatives and then return, and their families in Japan can also come to China to visit relatives and then return. In the future, it will be much easier to handle the procedures for Japanese elders like my mother who want to come to China to visit their children.
    The great and prosperous new China has extended a warm hand of friendship to the Japanese people. I firmly believe that with the continuous efforts of the people of the two countries, the wishes of the people of the two countries will surely be realized in the near future.

### 我的母亲到中国来了

    我的母亲到中国来了
    岩井纪美
    在目前中日两国的邦交还没有步入正常的时候，我的七十四岁的养母岩井睦从日本到中国来和我们一家团聚了。我对中国政府、中国红十字会和协助我们的日本朋友们表示深厚的谢意。
    我生在日本福岛县的一个乡村里，六岁的时候，父母亲把我给一个姓岩井的朋友作养女，因为他们没有孩子。我在专科学校毕业后，做过三年半的中学教员。那时，我认识了我的爱人阎纯志——他当时在日本留学。1944年，我到中国来和他结了婚，以后我一直住在中国。现在，我的爱人在本溪钢铁公司做工程师，我们有了两个女孩和一个男孩，过着幸福和睦的家庭生活。
    1952年，我的养父在日本去世了。年迈的养母一个人过着艰苦的生活，我时常惦念她。1953年秋天，有一批日侨回国，我委托了一个回福岛县的人去探望我的养母，把解放后我们过着幸福生活的情况告诉了她。那年十二月底，我的养母来信说，她想到中国来和我们生活在一起，以后，又不断来信谈这件事。但是，由于中日两国的邦交还没有恢复，两国侨民亲属来往访问的问题也没有解决，这就使得我的老母要离开日本到中国来的问题遇到了许多困难。
    1954年，我曾向辽宁省人民政府外事处接洽这件事，后来接到回信说，因为中日两国还没有恢复邦交的关系，辽宁省人民政府不能处理这个问题，要我向中央申请。以后，我又向中国红十字会写信，询问为我的养母申请入国的手续，并请他们协助。在他们的帮助之下，我收到了中国政府发给我的养母岩井睦的入境许可证。
    但是，我的老母在日本要办出国手续，怎么办呢？我又写信给曾经率领日本妇女代表团到中国访问的神近市子先生，请她协助。神近先生和我们素不相识，但她热情地帮助我们。她来信说，日本政府要求我们把中国政府发的入境许可证寄去，并且要我的爱人出具一份保证书，保证我的养母不够的旅费和在中国期间的一切费用由他负担，这个保证书要由中国的政府机关证明，有了这些文件，日本政府才能发给我的养母出境证。今年春天，我把入境许可证寄去了，同时寄去了我的爱人阎纯志写的保证书和请本溪市人民委员会民政局写的证明信。这样，神近市子先生就帮我的母亲把出国手续办好了。今年五月，离别十三年的母亲终于来到中国和我们见了面。这给我们家庭带来了很大的愉快。
    我们现在的生活方式虽然和日本人没有多大的差别，但是由于我的母亲上了年纪，还是感到有些不习惯。因此我想尽量改变一下我们的生活，使她能够适应。
    我母亲在日本的时候，长时期过着无依无靠的孤独的生活，到了中国以后，她的整个心安下来了，终日非常高兴。我的孩子们虽然和我的母亲言语不通，但是总要把他们得到的水果和糖果分给我母亲。我的九岁的大女儿还一定要和我母亲睡在一起。我的爱人从街上回来也时常给我母亲带一些礼物。我母亲对这种温暖的心意，常常快乐得流出泪来。
    我母亲来到这里后，街道上的工作人员们和邻居们都来欢迎她。大家为了我的驼了背、白发苍苍的老母能从遥远的地方来到这里，和我一同高兴。由于我母亲来得太急促，她老人家慌慌忙忙的，早就想好了要买给我们的礼物也来不及去买。只好在神户买了一些点心带了来。我母亲似乎对这件事总是感到过意不去。然而我的表弟表妹们，以及从日本报纸上知道我的母亲要来中国的我的朋友们，给我带来了各式各样的礼物。最使我高兴的是他们给我写了许多的信。我的爱人的从前的同学和同事们，我以前的朋友和我的学生们，都托我母亲带来了他们的信和照片。他们知道我很健康和幸福，也知道了我们母女两人的愿望能够得到实现，我的母亲可以来中国了，因此大家都为我高兴。
    从我母亲的谈话中和我接到的信中，我都了解到中国和日本的邦交正常化是日本人民的愿望。如果两国的邦交得到调整，能够自由来往，他们都非常想到中国来看看。最近，我从报纸上看到，中国红十字会和日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会三团体在天津会谈的公报中，曾表示要为开辟中日两国侨民相互自由往来的道路而努力。中国方面并已允许在中国和中国人结婚的日本妇女去日本探望亲属后再回来，她们在日本的家属也可以到中国来探望亲属后再回去。以后，像我母亲这样希望来中国看望儿女的日本父老，办理手续就要方便得多了。
    伟大的繁荣的新中国向日本人民伸出了温暖的友谊之手，我坚决相信，在两国人民不断努力之下，在不远的将来，两国人民的愿望是一定能实现的。
