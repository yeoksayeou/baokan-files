    The Soviet Union is Building an Atomic-Powered Icebreaker
    and Plans to Build Atomic-Powered Whalers, Trains, and Airplanes
    Xinhua News Agency, July 16th—According to Moscow Radio, Professor Khachaturov, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the Soviet Union is building a 16,000-ton atomic-powered icebreaker and is planning to build atomic-powered whalers, train locomotives, and airplanes with speeds exceeding 1,000 miles per hour.
    The atomic engine of the icebreaker under construction will have 44,000 horsepower, which will allow it to navigate at sea for several months without refueling.
    Regarding the construction of atomic-powered airplanes, Professor Khachaturov said that Soviet scientists are studying various designs for atomic-powered airplanes, which are equipped with turbine-propeller propulsion engines or jet engines that utilize atomic energy.
    These engines, which use uranium as fuel and can generate 60,000 horsepower, will be composed of turbo-compressors driven by steam turbines. Airplanes equipped with such engines can fly at 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers per hour.
    Khachaturov said: One kilogram of uranium fuel is enough to allow an airplane to fly 100,000 kilometers and possibly circumnavigate the Earth in fourteen to fifteen hours.
    Khachaturov also said that Soviet scientists are planning to install atomic-powered engines on whalers. In addition, they have found that it is entirely possible to build atomic-powered train locomotives. These train locomotives will weigh 300 tons, twice as heavy as the largest current train locomotives, and will be equipped with a turbine capable of generating 8,000 horsepower.

    苏联正在制造原子能破冰船
    并计划制造原子能推动的捕鲸船、火车和飞机
    据新华社16日讯　据莫斯科广播电台广播：苏联科学院通讯院士哈查图罗夫教授说，苏联正在制造一艘一万六千吨的原子能破冰船，并且正在计划制造用原子能推进的捕鲸船、火车机车和时速达一千英里以上的飞机。
    正在建造的破冰船的原子能发动机将有四万四千匹马力，这将使它可以在海上航行几个月而不用添加燃料。
    在原子能飞机的制造方面，哈查图罗夫教授说，苏联科学家正在研究各种原子能飞机的设计，这些飞机装置有利用原子能的涡轮机—螺旋桨推进机或者喷气发动机。
    这些用铀作燃料、能够发出六万匹马力的动力的发动机，将由利用汽轮机带动的涡轮—压气机组成。安装这种发动机的飞机，每小时可以飞行一千五百公里到两千公里。
    哈查图罗夫说：一公斤的铀燃料足够使飞机飞行十万公里，并且可能在十四到十五小时内环绕地球一周。
    哈查图罗夫还说，苏联科学家正在计划在捕鲸船上安装原子能推动的发动机。此外，他们还发现，建造用原子能推动的火车机车已经是十分可能的了。这种火车机车的重量是三百吨，比目前最大的火车机车要重一倍，它将装上一个可以发出八千匹马力的涡轮机。
