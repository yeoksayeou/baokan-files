    Dispatching Cadres to Agricultural Cooperatives with Poor Production

    (Report from this newspaper) The Hailun County in Heilongjiang Province is strengthening its leadership over agricultural cooperatives with poor production, striving to increase production and increase the income of cooperative members. After two rectifications during the spring plowing and summer hoeing periods, the majority of agricultural production cooperatives in Hailun County have improved. However, there are still 20% of the cooperatives with various problems. In some cooperatives, the division of labor among the leading backbone is unclear, the management committee is not functioning, and the production order is chaotic; in some cooperatives, the proportion of new members is large, and most of them were originally individual farmers, with more ideological problems and a lower labor attendance rate; some cooperatives have unresolved issues from the time of their establishment, and some members have low production enthusiasm. The production of these cooperatives is not good. In order to help these cooperatives improve their leadership, increase production, and ensure that members increase their income, the Hailun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires district and township leaders to quickly send capable cadres to these cooperatives to strengthen leadership, improve management, and improve production.

    派干部到生产差的社去
    本报讯　黑龙江省海伦县对生产差的农业合作社加强领导，争取增加生产，增加社员收入。海伦县的农业生产合作社经过春耕、夏锄期间两次整顿，绝大部分社都有了提高。但目前仍有20％的社存在各种各样的问题。有些社的领导骨干分工不明确，管理委员会不起作用，生产秩序混乱；有些社新社员比重大，而且大部分是原来的单干户，思想问题较多，劳动出勤率较低；有些社建社时候的遗留问题还没有解决，部分社员生产情绪不高。这些社的生产都不好。为了帮助这些社改进领导，提高生产，保证社员增加收入，中共海伦县委要求区、乡领导迅速派得力干部深入这些社加强领导，改进经营管理，把生产搞好。
