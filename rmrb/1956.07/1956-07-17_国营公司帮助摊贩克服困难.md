Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 15th: The Guangzhou "Southern Daily" reported on the 13th that the difficulties encountered by seventy cigarette and liquor vendors in Qingcheng Town, Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, are gradually being overcome with the help of state-owned specialized business companies.

　　These seventy cigarette and liquor vendors are scattered in the streets and alleys of Qingcheng Town and in the nearby rural areas. After the arrival of the upsurge of socialist transformation, they formed four cooperative groups. They not only maintained the good habit of "starting early and closing late," but also carried goods to the countryside, making it convenient for customers to buy. However, they encountered difficulties in their operations due to a shortage of funds, a lack of supply, and cumbersome tax payment procedures. They had an average of only 41.8 yuan in capital per household. Zhang Ji, who supported a family of seven, only had 30 yuan in capital. He tried his best to turn over these funds four times every three days, but his monthly sales were only 400 yuan, making it difficult to maintain his livelihood. He could not obtain a loan from the bank because he could not find a guarantor. These cigarette and liquor vendors also sold other commodities such as fruits, sweets, and pastries, but the supply of these supplementary commodities was often not guaranteed. Wu Ying's sales could have reached 300 yuan per month, but because of the difficulty in obtaining supplementary commodities, his actual monthly sales were only 200 yuan. The procedures for paying taxes were complicated. In order to pay taxes, they often had to go to several places and had to go early, otherwise they would be fined for late payment, which often delayed their purchasing and business. Under these circumstances, they all hoped that someone would "manage" them and solve their problems with funds, supply, and taxes.

　　In order to help them overcome these difficulties, the Qingyuan County Specialized Business Company set up a group to manage cigarette and liquor vendors within the company's wholesale department. This group was responsible for applying for loans from the bank and paying taxes on behalf of these seventy cigarette and liquor vendors, managing their supply of goods, contacting various parties for them to ensure that there was no shortage of supplementary commodities, and guiding their business operations while providing them with political and ideological education. In this way, the vendors could concentrate on their business. In addition, based on their business situation and the local standard of living, a minimum turnover was set for each household, and they were helped to reach this turnover level, thereby ensuring that they could obtain a reasonable income to maintain their livelihood.

　　After such arrangements, the difficulties of the seventy vendors have been properly resolved and taken care of. Many vendors believe that their "four major demands of borrowing funds, supplying goods, simplifying tax procedures, and taking the socialist road" have been met. They are determined to do their business well in the future and better serve consumers.

    国营公司帮助摊贩克服困难
    新华社广州15日电　广州“南方日报”十三日报道：广东省清远县清城镇七十户烟酒摊贩经营上存在的困难，正在国营专卖事业公司帮助下逐渐克服。
    这七十户烟酒摊贩分布在清城镇的大街小巷和近郊农村，在社会主义改造高潮到来以后，他们组成了四个合作小组，不但保持了“早开始、晚收市”的好习惯，还挑货下乡，便利顾客购买。但是，他们资金短绌、货源缺乏、缴纳税款手续麻烦，经营上因而发生困难。他们平均每户只有资金四十一元八角。养活一家七口的张戟，只有资金三十元，他尽了最大的努力，把这些资金每三天周转四次，每月的卖钱额也只有四百元，生活难以维持，向银行借贷因为没有人担保又借不到。这些烟酒摊贩还兼营水果、糖果、饼食等其他商品，但是这些兼营商品的货源常常没有保证。吴盈这一户的卖钱额每月本来可以达到三百元，因为兼营的商品的来源困难，每月的卖钱额实际只有二百元。缴纳税收的手续繁杂。为了缴税，他们常常要跑几个地方，而且要赶早，迟了就得罚滞纳金，经常因此耽误进货和营业。在这种情况下，他们都希望有人把他们“管”起来，代他们解决资金、货源、税收等问题。
    清远县专卖事业公司为了帮助他们克服这些困难，在公司批发部内设立了管理烟酒摊贩的小组，代替这七十户烟酒摊贩向银行贷款和缴纳税收，负责管理他们的货源供应，替他们向各方面联系，保证兼营商品的货源不缺少，同时负责指导他们的业务经营，对他们进行政治思想教育。这样，摊贩们就可以专心一意地经营业务。此外，还根据他们的营业情况和当地的生活水平，规定了每一户最低的营业额，并且帮助他们达到这个营业额水平，从而保证他们能够获得维持生活的合理收入。
    经过这样的安排，七十户摊贩的困难都得到了适当的解决和照顾。许多摊贩都认为，他们的“借贷资金、供应货源、简化税收手续、走社会主义道路”四大要求都得到了满足，今后一定要安心做好买卖，更好地为消费者服务。
