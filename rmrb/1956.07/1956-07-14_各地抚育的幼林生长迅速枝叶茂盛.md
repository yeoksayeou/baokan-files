Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Young forests across the country are growing rapidly and luxuriantly after being nurtured. According to information from the Ministry of Forestry, Jilin Province has now comprehensively completed its first round of nurturing work. The nurturing area for young forests in Liaoning Province has also increased more than tenfold compared to the same period last year. In Shandong Province, the nurtured young forests already account for half of the afforestation area this spring, with some areas having been nurtured twice. The young forest nurturing work in other provinces and regions such as Shanxi, Hebei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia is also progressing rapidly.

Because the afforestation area this year is relatively large, Party committees and forestry departments in various locations have strengthened their leadership over the nurturing of young forests. Hunan, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jilin and other provinces have specifically convened meetings to arrange nurturing work after the completion of afforestation. Fujian, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and other provinces have also successively issued instructions to strengthen the nurturing of young forests. The agricultural and forestry departments of many provinces and regions have also sent working groups to various locations to provide specific technical guidance, and key forest areas have also organized technical exchange networks. Experiences are exchanged in a timely manner, and visits and comparisons are organized. Therefore, the quality of young forest nurturing work in various locations this year is generally good, and work such as soil loosening, weeding, topdressing, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests has been carried out. In arid areas, the masses are also organized to water the saplings.

    各地抚育的幼林生长迅速枝叶茂盛
    新华社10日讯　全国各地的幼林经过抚育后，生长迅速，枝叶茂盛。据从林业部了解，现在吉林省已全面结束了第一次抚育工作，辽宁省幼林的抚育面积也比去年同期增加了十倍以上，山东省抚育的幼林，已占今春造林面积的一半，有的已抚育过两遍。其他如山西、河北、湖南、浙江、四川、内蒙古等省区的幼林抚育工作进展也都很快。
    由于今年的造林面积比较大，因此各地党委和林业部门都加强了对幼林抚育工作的领导，湖南、山东、浙江、吉林等省在造林工作结束后，专门召开会议布置抚育工作。福建、江苏、陕西、甘肃、青海等省也都先后发出了加强幼林抚育工作的指示。许多省区的农、林业部门还派出工作组到各地进行具体的技术指导，各重点林区还组织了技术交流网。及时交流经验并组织参观评比。因此，今年各地的幼林抚育工作的质量都较好，一般都进行了中耕除草、松土、培土和防治病虫害的工作。干旱的地区还组织群众进行浇水。
