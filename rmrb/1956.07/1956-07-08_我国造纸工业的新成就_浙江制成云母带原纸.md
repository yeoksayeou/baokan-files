    New Achievements in China's Paper Industry
    Zhejiang Produces Mica Tape Base Paper
    (Our Newspaper) News: A high-grade industrial paper that China has never manufactured before – mica tape base paper – has now been successfully trial-produced by Shou Hanwei, Assistant Researcher of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry. After technical appraisal by relevant central departments, its quality is considered to be close to the Soviet Union's national standards. Currently, with the assistance of relevant departments, Shou Hanwei is conducting medium-scale trials of mica tape base paper, and is also starting to trial-produce a long-fiber thin paper with higher technical requirements than mica tape base paper. This type of paper is currently made from expensive cotton, hemp, and silk abroad, but Shou Hanwei is using inexpensive mulberry bark, orange peel, etc. to produce it.
    Mica tape base paper is an indispensable insulating material in the large-scale electrical machinery industry, and in the past, it has always relied on foreign imports, which are very expensive. Shou Hanwei's creation is not only beneficial to the country's industrial construction but also creatively utilizes the role of bast long fibers such as mulberry bark in the paper industry.
    Bast long fibers such as mulberry bark are a papermaking raw material with high utilization value. Zhejiang produces a large quantity of this raw material. Recently, based on Shou Hanwei's creation, the Ministry of Light Industry has decided to establish a long-fiber thin paper factory in Hangzhou to manufacture industrial paper.

    我国造纸工业的新成就
    浙江制成云母带原纸
    本报讯　一种我国从没有制造过的高级工业用纸——云母带原纸，现在已由浙江省工业厅助理研究员寿汉伟试制成功。经中央有关部门进行技术鉴定以后，认为质量接近苏联的国家标准。现在，寿汉伟在有关部门的协助下，一面进行云母带原纸的中型试验，一面又着手试制一种比云母带原纸技术条件要求更高的长纤维薄型纸张。这种纸目前在国外是用价格较高的棉、麻和丝制造的，寿汉伟则利用廉价的桑皮、桔树皮等制成。
    云母带原纸是大型电机工业上一种不可缺少的绝缘材料，过去一向靠外国输入，价格很贵。寿汉伟的这一创造，不仅有利于国家的工业建设，而且创造性地发挥了桑皮等韧皮类长纤维在造纸工业上的作用。
    桑皮等韧皮类长纤维，是一种有着较高使用价值的造纸原料。浙江出产的这种原料数量很大。最近，中央轻工业部根据寿汉伟的这一创造，已决定在杭州建立制造工业用纸的长纤维薄型纸厂。
