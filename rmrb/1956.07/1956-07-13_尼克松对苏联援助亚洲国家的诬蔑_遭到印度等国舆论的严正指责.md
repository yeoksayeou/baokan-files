Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 11th: Indian newspapers sharply criticized U.S. Vice President Nixon's remarks in Karachi slandering Soviet aid to underdeveloped countries. Nixon had slanderously claimed that any country accepting Soviet aid risked "having a noose put around its neck."

　　Today's editorial in the "Hindustan Times" stated, "This attempt by Nixon to attack Soviet aid is a propaganda attack, and the very fact that it employs such strong language devalues the attack."

　　"Neutral countries accept Soviet aid because they need it to accelerate their construction projects."

　　The editorial said that Soviet aid is "evidence of the Soviet Union's desire for international cooperation," while "the aid given by the United States has more military components than economic ones, and if the economic aid allocated to neutral countries is far below their needs, and Nixon or other American leaders believe that they should not also accept Soviet aid, that is absurd."

　　The "Times of India" commented that Nixon seemed to doubt whether Asian countries have the ability and the right to decide for themselves whether to accept aid, therefore, "This puts Nixon in some contradictions, and these contradictions are difficult to promote the cause of the United States in the Asian countries that the American Vice President is currently visiting."

　　"The question is whether countries that do not participate in blocs have the right to decide on proposals for aid entirely based on the merits of the matter itself."

　　The commentary concluded, "One must assume that the conditions of a lightning visit are very unfavorable for clear and constructive thinking, which is precisely why the American Vice President believes that Manila and Taipei, rather than New Delhi or Rangoon, represent Asia's responsible attitude towards world affairs."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 11th: The "Indonesian Times" wrote today, "U.S. Vice President Mr. Nixon's statement in Karachi that any Asian country accepting Russian aid is risking 'having a noose put around its neck' is the most foolish statement he has made so far."

　　In response to Nixon's criticism in Manila that some countries have not correctly learned historical lessons, the newspaper said, "We must now say that he himself has not correctly learned the lessons, not the lessons of history, but the lessons of the modern world he is in."

　　The newspaper concluded by pointing out that what made Nixon say such foolish things was fear of the Soviet Union's peaceful competition and his own sense of weakness.

### 尼克松对苏联援助亚洲国家的诬蔑  遭到印度等国舆论的严正指责

    尼克松对苏联援助亚洲国家的诬蔑
    遭到印度等国舆论的严正指责
    据新华社新德里11日电　印度报纸尖锐抨击美国副总统尼克松在喀喇蚩发表的诬蔑苏联对不发达的国家的援助的谈话。尼克松曾诬蔑说，任何国家接受苏联援助都有“在脖子上被套上绳子”的危险。
    “印度斯坦时报”今天的社论说，“尼克松攻击苏联援助的这个尝试是一种宣传性的攻击，这种攻击采用了那么激烈的措词这个事实本身，就使这个攻击贬低价值”。
    “中立国家之所以接受苏联的援助是因为它们需要它来加速进行它们的建设工程”。
    社论说，苏联的援助是“苏联希望进行国际合作的明证”，而“美国所给予的援助是军事成分多于经济成分的，并且如果拨给中立国家的经济援助又远远低于它们的需要，而尼克松或是其他美国领袖却认为它们不应当另外还接受苏联的援助，那就是荒谬的事情。”
    “印度时报”的评论说，尼克松看来对于亚洲国家是否有能力和权利来为它们自己决定是否接受援助表示怀疑，因此，“这就使尼克松陷于一些矛盾之中，而这些矛盾是很难促进美国在这位美国副总统目前正在访问的亚洲国家中的事业的”。
    “问题是在于没有参加集团的国家是否有权完全根据事情本身的利弊来决定关于援助的各个建议”。
    评论最后说，“人们一定会假定，闪电访问的条件是很不利于进行清晰的和建设性的思考的，正因为如此，美国副总统才认为，马尼拉和台北，而不是新德里或仰光，是亚洲对世界事务的负责态度的代表。”
    据新华社雅加达11日电　“印度尼西亚时报”今天写道，“美国副总统尼克松先生在喀喇蚩所说的任何亚洲国家接受俄国的援助就是冒‘脖子上被套上绳子’的危险，这句话是他到目前为止所说过的最愚蠢的一句话。”
    报纸针对尼克松在马尼拉抨击某些国家没有正确地吸取历史教训这一点说，“我们现在必须说，他本人并没有正确地吸取教训，并不是历史的教训，而是他自己所处的现代世界的教训”。
    这家报纸最后指出，使尼克松说这种蠢话的是对苏联的和平竞赛的惧怕和自己的软弱感。
