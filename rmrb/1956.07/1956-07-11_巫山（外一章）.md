Wushan (and another chapter)
    Fang Ji
    --One of the Three Gorges Suite
    Bathing in the sun, gulls scatter everywhere;
    Rain follows the goddess down, morning after morning.
    --Du Fu
You who split open the Kui Gate and cut across the Wushan Mountains, the great river! Here, you have left behind magnificent miracles. Standing beneath the Goddess Peak, shrouded in mist and rain, the poet's strings trembled, emitting wonderful poetic thoughts. It is not due to Song Yu's frivolous poems, nor does anyone envy the bored King of Chu; the poet here had a real dream, dreaming of the people's hopes for thousands of years: steep cliffs hidden underground, the rolling river rising to the sky; Goddess Peak turned into a monument, commemorating the conquest of the Yangtze in our era. Here, the Yangtze River becomes the sea, and floods are blocked in the mountains; power stations guard the gorge entrance, and ships sail on the vast ocean. A pier will be built under Goddess Peak, allowing ships to sleep on her gentle shoulder; travelers will have even more wonderful dreams, dreaming that our motherland has become paradise. Those bird paths like lines carved on the steep cliffs, those ingenious cantilever bridges built on the broken cliffs, you can prove: this is not the poet's reverie, but the hope of thousands of years for millions of people.

    巫山（外一章）
    方纪
    ——三峡组诗之一晴浴狎鸥分处处　雨随神女下朝朝　　——杜甫你劈开夔门，横断巫山的大江呵！在这里留下了伟岸的奇迹。站在那疑云疑雨的神女峰下，诗人的琴弦颤动了，发出奇妙的
  诗思。并不是由于宋玉的轻薄的诗章，也没有谁羡慕那无聊的楚王；诗人在这里做了一个真实的梦，梦见了千百年来人民的希望：陡立的山岩隐没在地下，滚滚的江水升到了天上；神女峰变成了一座纪念碑，纪念在我们的时代征服了长江。在这里，长江变成大海，洪水被拦在山上；电站守卫在峡口，船只航行在广阔的海洋。神女峰下会建起一个码头，让船只睡在她温柔的肩下；旅客们会有更奇妙的梦，梦到我们的祖国变成了天堂。那刻在绝壑上的像线一样的鸟道呵，那搭在断崖上的巧妙的无夺桥呵，你们可以证明：这不是诗人的遐想，是千百年来千百万人民的希望。
