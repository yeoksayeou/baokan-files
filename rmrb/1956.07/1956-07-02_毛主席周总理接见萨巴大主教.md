Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai received Lebanese Orthodox Archbishop Niphon Saba and his secretary Rustum Salem Malek this evening.

Present at the meeting were Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace; Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman; Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China; and He Chengxiang, Director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs of the State Council.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the world-renowned peace advocate Lebanese Orthodox Archbishop Niphon Saba delivered a speech at a mass meeting in Beijing on June 30, warmly praising the Chinese people for "loving their motherland."

He said: "I have visited various parts of China. I have seen that the Chinese government is leading the people in peaceful construction and improving the living conditions of the people. If Western countries like the United States and the United Kingdom could use factories to serve the cause of peace and the happiness of the people as you do, then mankind could obtain lasting peace and happiness."

Niphon Saba, at the invitation of the Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a speech to more than a thousand listeners at a mass meeting convened by the organization. Since arriving in Beijing on June 10, he has visited Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and other places.

In his speech, the Archbishop also pointed out the abnormal situation that China has not yet entered the United Nations. He said: "If it is said that this is because China is a communist country, then the United States has already recognized many communist countries and established diplomatic relations with these countries. Six hundred million Chinese people have chosen their own system, and the United Nations should recognize this fact."

At the meeting, Niphon Saba also recited a poem entitled "To the Chinese People - Peace-loving People." This poem, full of enthusiasm and friendship, was welcomed by the audience with applause.

The meeting was held in the Zhongshan Hall, an ancient conference hall in Zhongshan Park, Beijing. Participants included people from religious, medical, industrial and commercial circles in Beijing. (Attached picture)

    毛主席周总理接见萨巴大主教
    新华社1日讯　毛泽东主席和周恩来总理今天晚上接见了黎巴嫩东正教大主教尼冯·萨巴和他的秘书鲁斯托姆·萨勒姆·马列克。
    接见的时候，在座的有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席廖承志，中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗，国务院宗教事务局局长何成湘。
    据新华社讯　世界著名的和平人士黎巴嫩东正教大主教尼冯·萨巴六月三十日在北京的一个群众集会上发表演说，他热烈称赞中国人民“热爱自己的祖国”。
    他说：“我曾到中国各地参观。我看到中国政府正在领导人民从事和平建设，改善人民的生活条件。如果像美国、英国这样的西方国家能够像你们一样，利用工厂来为和平事业和人民的幸福服务，那末人类就能得到持久的和平和幸福。”
    尼冯·萨巴应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会北京市分会的邀请，在这个团体召集的一次群众集会上向一千多名听众发表了演说。他自从六月十日来到北京后，曾经访问上海、南京、杭州等地。
    这位主教在演说中还指出了中国迄今没有进入联合国这一不正常的状况。他说：“如果说是因为中国是一个共产主义国家的话，那末美国已经承认了许多共产主义国家，并且同这些国家建立了外交关系。六亿中国人民已经选择了自己的制度，联合国应该承认这个事实。”
    尼冯·萨巴在这个集会上还朗诵了一首题为“给中国人民——爱好和平的人民”的诗。这首充满了热情和友谊的诗受到了听众的鼓掌欢迎。
    这次集会是在北京中山公园一个古老的会议厅——中山堂里举行的，参加的人包括北京的宗教、医务、工商等各界人士。（附图片）
