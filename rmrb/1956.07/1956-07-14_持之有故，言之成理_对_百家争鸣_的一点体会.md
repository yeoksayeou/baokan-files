    "Having a Basis and Speaking Logically"
    — Some Thoughts on "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" —
    Song Yunbin
    "Let a hundred flowers bloom" and "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" are two slogans, but the sentence structure is the same: "齐" (qí, together) is an adverb of "放" (fàng, bloom/release), and "争" (zhēng, contend) is an adverb of "鸣" (míng, speak/sound). However, some people now disassemble the term "争鸣" (zhēngmíng, contend and speak), saying things like "We must contend well and speak well," "A hundred speak, contend for a family," "Those who speak must be a family, and those who are not a family should not speak," "Speaking is the same as being a family," and so on, a lot of them. What does this mean? It doesn't mean anything; it's just a word game.
    I believe that the slogan "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" is nothing more than a call to launch free academic debates and to make free debate a common practice. If we didn't put forward a slogan but simply said, "Let's launch free academic debates," it wouldn't have the same power and wouldn't play the same role in calling people to action. We had to use an idiom like "Let a hundred flowers bloom" to make the call, and thus the idiom "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" was given new meaning and put forward.
      "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" is an old slogan, but it has new content today. Mr. Guo Moruo is very correct on this point. He said: "'Let a hundred schools of thought contend' has its era significance. Whenever social development reaches a watershed stage, a situation of 'let a hundred schools of thought contend' will always appear sooner or later in cultural activities." He also said: "The 'Let a hundred schools of thought contend' that we advocate today, as I understand it, is different from the rise of various schools of thought during the Warring States period, and also different from the 'Renaissance' in early modern Europe."
    Therefore, as long as we can grasp the spirit of the times and understand why we are now emphasizing the slogan "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," we will certainly have the courage and confidence to launch ideological struggles within the people—that is, to conduct free academic debates, without any worries. I agree with Comrade Lu Dingyi's opinion: "Within the people, there is not only the freedom to propagate materialism, but also the freedom to propagate idealism. As long as they are not counter-revolutionaries, whether they propagate materialism or idealism, they are free. The debate between the two is also free." I disagree with setting too many restrictions while calling for "Let a hundred schools of thought contend." For example, "We must contend well and speak well," "We must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism," "We must use Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology of 'Let a hundred schools of thought contend'," and so on. These are all nonsense. Today, we neither adopt Emperor Wu of Han's method of "venerating Confucianism exclusively and dismissing the other schools," nor is there any question that Marxism-Leninism should be the guiding ideology, so why add so many restrictions while calling for "Let a hundred schools of thought contend"? What are the standards for "contending well and speaking well"? What if the contention and speaking are not good?
    In my opinion, anything that "has a basis and speaks logically" can be recognized as one school of thought, allowing it the freedom to propagate and debate. "Having a basis" means that the theory has a basis (at least it can form a system of its own); "speaking logically" means that the speech is coherent and logical (at least it can be self-consistent). Of course, the basis is not necessarily materialistic; it may be idealistic. That doesn't matter; we can launch debates and struggles. Debates don't necessarily have to reach a conclusion (it's best if they can). We say that "having a basis and speaking logically" is not a restriction but a basic condition for launching academic debates. If it has no basis and does not speak logically, it becomes random speaking. How can we launch debates if it's just random speaking?

    “持之有故，言之成理”
    ——对“百家争鸣”的一点体会——
    宋云彬
    “百花齐放”和“百家争鸣”是两个口号，但句子的构造是一样的：“齐”是“放”的副词，“争”是“鸣”的副词。可是现在有的人把“争鸣”一词给拆开了，说“要争得好，鸣得好啦”，“百鸣争家”啦，“鸣者必家，非家莫鸣”啦，“鸣即是家”啦，等等，多得很。这有什么意思呢？没有什么意思，文字游戏而已。
    我认为提出“百家争鸣”的口号无非是号召展开学术上的自由辩论，让自由辩论成为一种风气。如果不提一个口号，而只简单地说“咱们要展开学术上的自由辩论”，那就没有力量，不起号召作用；必须用一句像“百花齐放”之类的成语来作号召，于是“百家争鸣”这句成语就给添上了新的意义而提出来了。
      “百家争鸣”是个老口号，在今天却有它的新内容。这一点郭沫若先生说得非常正确。他说：“‘百家争鸣’具有它的时代性。每逢社会发展达到了一个划时期的阶段，在文化活动中总要或迟或早地呈现出一个‘百家争鸣’的局面。”又说：“在今天我们所主张的‘百家争鸣’，据我的了解，既不同于（战国时代的）诸子蜂起，也不同于（欧洲近代初期的）‘文艺复兴’。”
    因此，我们只要能够掌握时代精神，懂得为什么现在才着重提出“百家争鸣”的口号，那我们一定能够有胆量有信心地在人民内部展开思想斗争——就是进行学术上的自由辩论，用不着有什么顾虑了。我同意陆定一同志的意见：“在人民内部，不但有宣传唯物主义的自由，也有宣传唯心主义的自由。只要不是反革命分子，不管是宣传唯物主义或者是宣传唯心主义。都是有自由的。两者之间的辩论，也是自由的。”我不同意在号召“百家争鸣”的同时定出过多的清规戒律来。例如“要争得好，鸣得好”啦，“要加强马克思列宁主义的学习”啦，“要用马克思列宁主义作‘百家争鸣’的指导思想”啦，等等。这些全是废话。我们今天既不采取汉武帝“独尊儒术，罢黜百家”的办法，而马克思列宁主义之应该作为指导思想早已不成问题，那又何必在号召“百家争鸣”的同时加上过多的限制呢？要求大家“争得好，鸣得好”，“好”的标准究竟是怎么样的呢？争得不好、鸣得不好又怎么办呢？
    我的意见，凡是“持之有故，言之成理”的，都可以承认它是一家之言，让它有宣传和辩论之自由。“持之有故”就是理论有根据（至少能够自成一套）；“言之成理”就是说话有条理而合乎逻辑（至少能够自圆其说）。当然，所谓有根据，它的根据不一定是唯物主义的，可能是唯心主义的。那也不要紧，我们可以展开辩论，展开斗争。展开辩论也不一定要得出结论（能够得出结论自然最好）。我们说要“持之有故，言之成理”并不是什么清规戒律，而是展开学术辩论的一个起码条件。如果持之无故，言之不成理，那就成为乱鸣了。乱鸣怎么可以展开辩论呢？
