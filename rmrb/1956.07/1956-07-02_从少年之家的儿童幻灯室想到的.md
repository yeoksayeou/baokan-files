    Thoughts Inspired by the Children's Slide Room at the Children's Palace
    Tang Yu

    One Sunday, I visited the children's slide room at the Beihai Children's Palace and saw groups of children entering with excitement and leaving with laughter, one show after another. The entrance to the slide room was lined with a long queue almost all day. I noticed that some children were queuing up for the third time.

    This scene was very moving. I thought: if each show could add a few more newsreels, scientific knowledge segments, and stories of heroic role models, it would play an even greater role in expanding children's wisdom and cultivating the communist morality of the new generation. However, why hasn't this convenient and flexible form of cultural entertainment, so loved by children, been widely adopted and valued by children's workers, writers, artists, and slide workers? It is entirely possible to set up a small room in parks, schools, and neighborhoods to establish such a slide station. Moreover, the prices of slide projectors and slides are also very cheap. Children's parents can spend money renting picture books for their children, so can't they also spend a penny or two to jointly maintain the expenses of a children's slide station?

    Unfortunately, some people think that slides are like dead or "earthy" movies, and children will not welcome them. Our writers and artists rarely write scripts or create drawings for slides. The slide factories also produce too few slides for children. Up to now, the annual distribution of slides nationwide, including those for rural areas, factories, mines, and troops, is still less than 200,000 sets. It is said that in the Soviet Union, hundreds of types are produced every year, with 5 to 6 million sets distributed, nearly half of which are made for children. Children can watch slides in schools, parks, clubs, and homes.

    It is said that the Beihai Children's Palace has been holding these shows continuously since last year, showing five sessions every Sunday, and almost every session is full. This slide station has already had more than 70,000 visitors; the work of projectionists and narrators is also voluntarily undertaken by the children in their spare time. It is just a pity that there is only one children's slide station in the entire city of Beijing.

    从少年之家的儿童幻灯室想到的
    唐瑜
    一个星期天，我在北海少年之家参观了儿童幻灯室，看到了一群一群的孩子兴高采烈地入场，散场时又欢笑着走出来，一场接着一场。幻灯室的入口处，几乎整天都排成一条很长的行列。我发现有一些孩子已经是第三次排队入场了。
    这情景是很使人激动的。我想：如果每一场的节目能够再加映几片新闻、科学知识和一些英雄模范人物的故事，对增广儿童的智慧，培养新的一代的共产主义品德将会起更大的作用。可是，这种为孩子们热爱而又轻便灵活的文化娱乐活动形式，为什么至今还没有被少年儿童工作者、作家、美术家和幻灯工作者所广泛采用和重视呢？在公园、学校、里弄里辟一个小屋子，设立这样一个幻灯站，是完全可能的。而且，幻灯机幻灯片的价钱也很便宜，孩子们的父母可以花钱给孩子租小人书，不是也可以同样花一两分钱来共同维持儿童幻灯站的经费吗？
    遗憾的是，有人认为幻灯是死电影土电影，孩子是不会欢迎的，我们的作家和美术家们很少为幻灯片写过剧本和创作画稿；幻灯厂给儿童们看的幻灯片也制作得太少了。到现在全国每年发行的幻灯片，连农村、工矿、部队的在内还不足二十万套。听说在苏联，每年就摄制了几百种，发行五、六百万套，其中将近一半是为儿童制作的，孩子们在学校、公园、俱乐部、家庭中都可以看到幻灯。
    据说北海少年之家从去年就开始连续不断地举办，每星期天映出五场，几乎是每一场都客满了的。这个幻灯站已经拥有观众七万多人次；放映员和解说员这一工作也由孩子们自愿地在课余轮流来担负。就可惜全北京只有这么一个儿童幻灯站。
