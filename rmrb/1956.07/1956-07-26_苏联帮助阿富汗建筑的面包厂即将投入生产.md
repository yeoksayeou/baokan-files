    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔24日讯：苏联帮助阿富汗建筑的巨大面包厂的安装工作正在全面地展开，工厂很快就将投入生产。
    这个工厂将是阿富汗首都规模最大和最现代化的企业。从收进谷物直到出成品全部生产过程都是自动化的。
    喀布尔面包厂是一个综合性建筑，包括可以装两万吨谷物的谷仓、一昼夜生产六十吨面粉的磨坊、一昼夜生产五十多吨面包和点心的面包厂、仓库、蓄水池、汽车房等等。
    兴建这个面包厂的资金是苏联政府根据1954年5月24日的协定给予阿富汗的贷款。
    根据苏联机构的代表和阿富汗财政部不久前在喀布尔签订的一项协定，苏联还派遣一批专家到阿富汗为喀布尔面包厂训练阿富汗工作人员。
