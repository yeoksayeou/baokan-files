The Louvre Museum

The Louvre Palace, located on the banks of the Seine, is a quadrangle of buildings, part of which is now used as a museum, housing a world-renowned collection.

The museum does not charge admission on Sundays and holidays; although good reproductions are sold at the entrance, visitors are not prohibited from bringing their own cameras, but those who bring cameras must pay an additional 50 francs.

Like any famous area in Paris, one often sees a guide speaking English, German, or Spanish followed by dozens of foreign tourists, mostly Americans. The guide recites well-rehearsed, stereotypical introductions in English.

In the Italian school of painting, the museum is most famous for its collection of works by Leonardo da Vinci. In front of his masterpiece "Gioconda" (Eternal Smile, also known as Mona Lisa), there are always crowds of people, and if you can't wait patiently or find a chance to squeeze forward, it's hard to get close. The Flemish school and the Dutch school, known for their realism, are sufficiently represented by Quentin Massys' "The Moneylender and His Wife" and Frans Hals' "Gypsy Girl." In "The Moneylender and His Wife," the husband is carefully examining gold coins, while the wife also turns her gaze away from the open scripture to discuss the coin with her husband. And "Gypsy Girl" movingly depicts the girl's boldness and enthusiasm. The great Rembrandt is represented here by his famous "Bathsheba at Her Bath." This work, modeled on the painter's housekeeper, who was also his mistress, is a work from the period when the painter's life was difficult and not understood by his contemporaries. As people say, it expresses an almost solemn beauty and melancholy, which can be said to be a portrayal of the painter's own mood at the time.

The museum has the largest collection of French works. The early "Fontainebleau" school's "Cupid," the beautiful Venus, and a group of playful angels vividly depict a scene of mystery, happiness, and joy on the canvas. Philip de Champaigne's "Portrait of Arnaud" has reached a high level of realism, with one of the figures' hands appearing to reach out of the window. Chardin's "The Kitchen Maid" has already begun to depict subjects from ordinary life. The kitchen maid, holding bread, mutton, and red wine, stands in the outer room of the kitchen, with the back view of a maid walking away in the inner room. Ordinary scenes from life are arranged by the painter in a very engaging way. The 19th century was the flourishing period of the French school, with Courbet, Rousseau, Corot, and Millet all being masters of pastoral landscapes. Monet's landscapes emphasizing color depiction, and Renoir's figures emphasizing the capture of light, had already begun the great tide of Impressionism. Degas uniquely uses chalk-like effects to paint the beautiful postures of dancers. The works of Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Cezanne were extensively introduced in China before the War of Resistance Against Japan. These paintings can still be understood and appreciated by the general public, but the further development of modernism, with exaggeration and deformation as creative principles, makes it difficult for us to understand and appreciate the pictures.

The Louvre is one of Europe's art treasures, but it must be said that it is impossible to visit such a large European museum without taking a superficial approach. It is really annoying to rush through it once or twice in this way. I am afraid this is the common annoyance of every museum visitor. (Attached picture)

    卢夫宫博物馆
    塞纳河畔的卢夫宫，是一组楼房的四合大院，其中一部分建筑物，现在辟作了博物馆，有着世界著名的珍藏。
    这个博物馆在星期天和假日不收门票；虽然门口出卖着很好的复制品，但不拒绝观众自己携带照相机，只是带照像机的观众要加收五十法郎而已。
    正像巴黎的任何名胜地区一样，常看见一个讲英文、德文或西班牙文的向导后面跟着好几十个外国游客，最多的还是美国人。向导用英文背诵着烂熟的、刻板的介绍。
    在意大利画派中，这个博物馆以辽奥纳多·达·芬奇的作品的收藏最为著名。在他的名作“乔弓达”（永远的微笑，又叫莫娜丽莎）前面，总是围着成群的人，如果你不能耐心地等待或者瞅空子往前挤的话，便很难凑到跟前。以写实著称的弗拉蒙画派和荷兰画派只要举出坤廷·麦赛斯的“高利贷者和他的妻子”和弗朗斯·哈尔斯的“吉卜赛女郎”这两张就足以代表了。在“高利贷者和他的妻子”这幅画中，丈夫在细心地辨认金币，而妻子也把眼神离开了翻开的经书，和丈夫一起讨论这枚金币了。而“吉卜赛女郎”，动人地描写了这个姑娘的豪放和热情。而伟大的伦勃朗，这里有他著名的“入浴的拔示巴”。这个以画家的女管家、也是他的情妇为模特儿的作品，是画家晚年生活困苦和不为当时人所谅解的时期的作品。正如人们所说的，它表现了近乎庄严的美丽和忧郁，可以说是画家当时自己的心情的写照。
    博物馆中收藏最多的是法兰西派，早期的“枫丹白露”画派的“爱神”，美丽的维纳斯和一群顽皮的天使把神秘、幸福、欢乐的情景活现在画面上。斐立普·德·昔宾内的“阿诺德的肖像”已经达到了高度的写实水平，画中人物的一只手就像真的伸出窗口外面一样。沙尔丁的“送食品的女商人”已经开始描写普通生活中的题材，女商人拿着面包、羊肉、红酒，站在厨房的外室，内室是走去的女佣人的背影。生活中的普通场面被画家安排得很是引人入胜。十九世纪更是法国画派的兴盛时期，柯贝特、卢索、柯罗、米勒等都是田园风景的大师，莫奈的着重色彩描绘的风景，雷诺瓦的着意捕捉光线的人物，已经开始了印象派的巨潮了。而戴卡独树一帜地用着类似粉笔画的效果来画舞蹈家们的美丽的姿态。梵·高、高更、赛尚的作品曾在抗日战争前在我国被大量地介绍过，这些画还是能够使一般人了解和欣赏的，但现代主义绘画的进一步的发展，把夸张、变形作为创作原则以后的图画便很难使我们了解和欣赏了。
    卢夫宫是欧洲艺术宝库之一，但应该说，参观欧洲这种大博物馆，不采取走马观花的方法是不可能的，这种跑步式地草草看上一遍两遍真是使人烦恼的事。恐怕这也是每一个参观博物馆的游客的普遍的烦恼。（附图片）
