Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 25th. A fishing ground has been constructed in the Sipai Township of Longsheng Autonomous County, Guangxi Province, nestled within a range of towering mountains.

Where do the fish come from? In the Xun River, located in the deep valleys of the high mountains, during the spring and summer flood seasons, schools of fish swim upstream from Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County and Liuzhou in the lower reaches to spawn here, only to be blocked. It is estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 *jin* of fish come here to spawn each year.

The fishing methods used at the fishing ground are based on the fishing experience of the local Yao, Miao, and Dong farmers. All that is needed is a large iron mesh to block the water flow, and then the fish are driven one by one into iron wire cages. These fishing implements can be used for thirty years.

Fish were caught on the first day after the fishing ground was built. The construction of the fishing ground cost 3,000 yuan, and the site only requires five or six management personnel. The annual fishing income can reach 40,000 to 100,000 yuan.

### 崇山峻岭中的捕鱼场

    崇山峻岭中的捕鱼场
    新华社桂林25日电　在广西省龙胜各族自治县思梅乡崇山峻岭合抱的地方，修建成一个捕鱼场。
    鱼从那里来呢？在高山深谷下的浔江里，每逢春夏两季涨水期间，鱼群就从下游三江侗族自治县和柳州一带，逆水游到这里产卵，一来就被挡住了。估计每年到这里产卵的鱼群有十万至二十万斤。
    鱼场的捕鱼方法是根据当地瑶、苗、侗族农民捕鱼经验总结出来的。只需用一个大铁经网拦住水流，然后把鱼群一一赶到铁丝鱼笼里就行了。这些捕鱼用具能够使用三十年。
    捕鱼场建成后的第一天就捕到了鱼。兴建捕鱼场用去三千元，场里只须五六个管理人员。每年捕鱼收入可达四万元到十万元。
