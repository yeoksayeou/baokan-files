Shanghai Fudan University has recently promoted fourteen lecturers to associate professors with the approval of the Ministry of Higher Education. In addition, three faculty members have been granted the academic title of associate professor.

The lecturers promoted this time are mostly young. They have received good reviews in teaching and have also achieved certain accomplishments in scientific research. For example, Xia Daoxing, a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics, has a high level of understanding of single operator function structures. Most of the twenty-two mathematical papers he has written have been published, and mathematical journals in the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the United States have written articles to introduce them. Gu Chaohao, a lecturer and deputy director of the Geometry and Algebra Teaching and Research Group, has written twenty-six scientific papers. Among them, the article "K-extension Space Theory under Implicit Function Representation" has received high praise from the Soviet review magazine "Mathematics." Xie Xide, a lecturer and director of the Solid State Physics Teaching and Research Group, is not only conscientious in her teaching work, but also has in-depth research on solid state physics, especially semiconductors. Jiang Xuemo, a lecturer in the Department of Economics who was promoted to associate professor, has achieved excellent results in teaching and has also made certain achievements in scientific research.

    上海复旦大学提升十四名讲师为副教授
    本报讯　上海复旦大学有十四名讲师，最近经高等教育部批准提升为副教授。还有三位教员获得副教授的学衔。
    这次提升的讲师，大部分是青年。他们在教学方面曾获得好评，在科学研究上也获得一定的成就。如数学系讲师夏道行，对单业函数结构有较高的修养，他所写的二十二篇数学论文，大部分已经发表，苏联、民主德国、美国的数学杂志，都曾撰文评介。几何代数教研组副主任谷超豪讲师，曾经撰写了二十六篇科学论文。其中“隐函数表示下的K展空间理论”一文，受到苏联评论性杂志“数学”很高的评价。固体物理教研组主任谢希德讲师，不仅教学工作认真，而且对固体物理，特别是对半导体有较深入的研究。被提升为副教授的经济系讲师蒋学模，他在教学方面获得优秀的效果，在科学研究上也有一定的成绩。
