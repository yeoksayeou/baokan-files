Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 22nd: The eighth National Congress of the Kuomintang of Indonesia is scheduled to open today in Semarang.

According to newspaper reports, D. N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang of Indonesia, congratulating the eighth National Congress of the Kuomintang of Indonesia on its success. Aidit hoped that this congress would achieve significant accomplishments in Indonesia's economic independence, expanding the democratic rights of the people and people's organizations, recovering West Irian, cooperation between various parties and social organizations, and promoting peace in Asia and the world.

On the eve of the congress, Mangunsarkoro, acting chairman of the Kuomintang of Indonesia, gave a speech on July 20th explaining the populism advocated by the party. He said that as an ideology, populism belongs to the world's socialist trend. He also said that this is socialism based on Indonesia's social life.

Mangunsarkoro said: Populism includes many basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, but at the same time, it also has many different viewpoints from the latter. The main difference is: populism does not believe that class struggle is the only path to a socialist society.

Mangunsarkoro said: His party, which strives to achieve the ideal of populism, is based on the proletariat—workers, peasants, small merchants, and small industrialists.

    印度尼西亚国民党开代表大会
    艾地致电预祝大会获得重大成就
    据新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚国民党第八次全国代表大会订于今天在三宝垄开幕。
    据报纸报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地致电印度尼西亚国民党中央委员会，预祝印度尼西亚国民党第八次全国代表大会成功。艾地希望这个代表大会将在印度尼西亚的经济独立、扩大人民和人民团体的民主权利、收复西伊里安、各党派和社会团体的合作以及促进亚洲和全世界的和平等方面获得重大的成就。
    在代表大会召开的前夕，印度尼西亚国民党代理主席曼贡萨科罗七月二十日发表谈话说明这个党所提倡的平民主义。他说，作为一种意识形态，平民主义是属于世界的社会主义潮流的。他又说，这是以印度尼西亚的社会生活作为根据的社会主义。
    曼贡萨科罗说：平民主义包括有马克思列宁主义中的许多基本观点，而同时与后者也有许多不同的观点。主要的不同点是：平民主义并不认为阶级斗争是走向社会主义社会的唯一道路。
    曼贡萨科罗说：他的争取实现平民主义理想的党是以无产阶级——工人、农民、小商人和小工业家——作为基础的。
