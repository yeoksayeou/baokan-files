	Let the Diesel Engines Run!
	Many diesel engines used for coalfield geological exploration are now out of operation due to a lack of spare parts. The main reason for this situation is that diesel engine manufacturers are unwilling to produce spare parts for us.
	Our bureau's affiliated units ordered diesel engine spare parts from the Wuxi Second Industrial Bureau in November of last year. Both parties signed an agreement. However, in March of this year, the bureau sent an official letter stating that because of the importance of agricultural machinery manufacturing tasks, they were canceling the contract signed with our bureau and would not supply diesel engine spare parts. Our bureau sent people to negotiate, and they reluctantly agreed to produce a portion of the spare parts, reducing the original thirty specifications to six specifications, and postponing delivery until the third or fourth quarter of the year.
	In order to solve the current urgent need, our bureau also requested blueprints from various diesel engine manufacturers, preparing to have our bureau's affiliated repair and parts factories manufacture some of the spare parts themselves. However, when requesting blueprints, we discovered that the factories had modified the blueprints multiple times during the diesel engine manufacturing process. Some modification records were incomplete, and some had no modification records at all. Therefore, spare parts manufactured according to the blueprints cannot be used on diesel engines manufactured by the same factory.
	In order to solve the urgently needed diesel engine spare parts for the coalfield geological exploration system, the Ministry of Coal Industry has established a procurement team to specifically study and handle this issue. However, until now, the problem has not been fundamentally resolved. Therefore, in addition to the coalfield geological exploration system continuing to make the greatest efforts, we urgently hope that relevant departments, especially the Wuxi Second Industrial Bureau and the Fourth Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, will provide strong assistance, and when making overall plans, consider the production of diesel engine spare parts.

    让柴油机开动起来吧
    煤田地质勘探用的柴油机，现在有许多因为缺乏配件停止运转了。造成这种情况的主要原因，是柴油机制造厂不愿给我们制作配件。
    我局所属单位在去年11月就向无锡第二工业局定制柴油机配件。双方签定了协议。但是今年三月份该局却来公文说，因为农业机械制造任务重要，取消跟我局签订的合同，不供应柴油机配件了。我局派人前去交涉，最后他们才免强答应承制一部分，由原来三十种规格减为六种规格，并且推迟到三、四季度才交货。
    为了解决目前的急需，我局同时向各柴油机制造厂索取图纸，准备由我局所属修配厂自己制作部分配件。但是，在索取图纸的时候，我们发现各厂在制造柴油机过程中，多次修改图纸，有的修改记录不全，有的根本没有修改记录，因此按照图纸制作的配件，不能用于同一个厂所制造的柴油机上。
    为了解决煤田地质勘探系统迫切需要的柴油机配件，煤炭工业部已成立采购小组，专门研究处理这一问题。但是，直到现在，问题还没有根本解决。因此，除了煤田地质勘探系统要继续作最大的努力外，我们迫切希望有关部门、特别是无锡市第二工业局、第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局给以大力协助，在做全面规划的时候，要考虑到柴油机配件的生产问题。
