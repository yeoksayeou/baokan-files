Specific Measures to Realize Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend
    Li Jinxi
    In modern times, how should the "hundred schools" "contend"? Obviously, it is through publication.

    Publishing monographs and articles in newspapers and periodicals is the way to "contend." In recent years, the categorization of the publishing industry has been most in line with the principle of "hundred schools," because becoming a "school" necessarily involves a certain scientific category, a relatively complete system, and a considerable scientific foundation. However, if the person in charge of each type of book and periodical or each publishing unit is the editor; if the editor's level is not high, unable to review the quality of manuscripts, blindly following the words of "one school," or holding deep-seated prejudices, unable to abide by this policy, to comprehensively consider the views of "many schools," then some "schools" will lack the opportunity to "contend."

    The so-called "contention," isn't this "contention" just debate? It is an adverb of the word "contend"; "contention" is only equal to speaking "enthusiastically" and contributing opinions "to the greatest extent." As long as they are monographs and papers that have become a "school," we should initially let them realize this word "contend."

    Further, when they debate with each other, the publishing aspect should have appropriate and organic handling methods. For example, if A refutes B's statement, it should be handed over to B for self-review. B should calmly examine it, attach annotations paragraph by paragraph, either accepting revisions, defending, or counterattacking; then the editor publishes them together, so that C can come out to mediate and judge, and A and B (or even C) can conduct deeper debates. In this way, the "contention" can be "contended" more loudly (organized and focused), but not noisy (avoiding repetition and not dynamically attituded).

    The editors of publishing institutions have a great relationship with the implementation of the policy of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," which can almost be said to play a decisive role. Strengthening the leadership of the publishing industry and improving the ideological and professional level of editors, I think this is one of the specific measures to effectively realize "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    实现百家争鸣的具体措施
    黎锦熙
    “百家”在现代是怎样的“鸣”法，很显然，是出版。
    出版专著，发表论文在报刊上，这样才能“鸣”出来。近几年出版事业分类化，是最符合于“百家”这个原则的，因为成“家”的必然在科学上有一定的类属，有比较完整的体系和相当的科学基础。但是每一类的书刊或每一出版单位，负责人是编辑者；编辑者要是水平不高，不能审定稿件质量，只盲从“一家”之言，或者成见颇深，不能遵守这方针，来兼综“众家”之说，那么有些“家”就缺少“鸣”出来的机会了。
    所谓“争鸣”，这“争”字还不就是争辩，它是“鸣”字的副词；“争鸣”只等于“热烈地”发言，“尽量地”贡献意见。只要是成了“家”的专著和论文，我们应当初步地让他们实现这个“争”字。
    进一步，彼此争辩起来，出版方面更该有适当的有机的处理方法。例如甲驳乙说，应当交乙自审。乙要平心静气地检查，逐段附以按语，或接受改订，或申辩，或反攻；然后由编者一起发表出来，好让丙出来折中判断，而甲和乙（或者连上丙）可以再深入地进行争辩。这样才可以“鸣”得更嘹亮（有条理，有重点），而又不嘈杂（避免重复，不动态度）。
    出版机构的编辑者对于贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针是有很大的关系的，简直可以说是能起决定作用的。加强出版事业的领导，提高编辑者的思想和业务水平，我觉得这是有效地实现“百家争鸣”的具体措施之一。
