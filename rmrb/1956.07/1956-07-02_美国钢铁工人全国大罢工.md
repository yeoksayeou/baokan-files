Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 1st - Six hundred and fifty thousand steelworkers in twenty-seven states across the United States began a nationwide strike at 00:01 this morning. In the well-known American steel industry centers of Pittsburgh, Gary, and other cities, the skies that are usually illuminated by the glow of steel furnaces at night have become dark before dawn today.

The strike began six hours after negotiations between the union and management regarding wage contracts broke down. With the exception of a few factories, the vast majority of American steel factories have ceased production, and approximately 90% of the nation's steel supply has been halted. This is another nationwide steel industry strike since the 1952 steel industry strike—which caused a loss of $5 billion in steel production. It is estimated that this strike will result in a loss of $40 million each day, a loss of more than 2.2 million tons of steel each week, and if it is not resolved within a longer period, the activities of national commerce and industry in the United States will be affected.

The United Steelworkers of America, representing the steelworkers, and the representatives of twelve major American steel companies, including U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, and Republic Steel, began negotiations on May 28th, attempting to sign a new wage contract to replace the one that expired at midnight on June 30th. After forty-five meetings, the negotiations finally broke down at 6:00 PM on June 30th, because no agreement was reached on the issues of wage increases and the duration of the contract. In a statement issued at midnight on June 30th, the president of the United Steelworkers of America accused the steel company authorities of bearing full responsibility for the nationwide shutdown.

It is revealed that during the negotiations, the union proposed signing a three-year wage contract, with a wage increase of $0.20 per hour in the first year of the contract. These demands were rejected by the management. The union also made proposals regarding increased wages for work on holidays and other benefits. Most of these demands were also rejected by the management.

In the last few days of the negotiations, the union suggested extending the current contract deadline from June 30th to July 17th to allow both parties to continue negotiations to seek a solution, but this suggestion was also rejected by the management. Furthermore, the steel companies began banking their furnaces and cooling down blast furnaces from June 28th, threatening workers with the prospect of a strike.

### 美国钢铁工人全国大罢工

    美国钢铁工人全国大罢工
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：分布在美国二十七个州里的六十五万名钢铁工人从今晨零点零一分开始举行全国大罢工。在美国的著名钢铁工业中心匹兹堡、格利等城市，在那夜间通常为炼钢炉火光所照亮的天空，今天在黎明之前已变成一片黑暗。
    这次罢工是在工会和资方关于工资合同的谈判破裂后的六小时开始的。除少数工厂外，绝大部分美国钢铁工厂都已经停止生产，大约占全国90％的钢铁供应已经停顿。这是1952年钢铁业大罢工——这次罢工曾经使钢铁生产损失五十亿美元——以来又一次全国规模的钢铁业罢工。据估计，由于这次罢工，每一天将要损失四千万美元，每一个星期将要损失二百二十多万吨钢，而且假如它在一个较长的时期内不能获得解决，美国全国工商业的活动都要受到影响。
    代表钢铁工人的联合钢铁工人工会和代表十二家美国大钢铁公司的美国钢铁公司、伯利恒钢铁公司和共和钢铁公司的代表，从五月二十八日起就开始举行谈判，企图签订一个新的工资合同来代替到六月三十日午夜十二时满期的工资合同。在经过四十五次的会议之后，谈判终于在六月三十日下午六时宣告破裂，因为在增加工资和合同期限的问题上没有达成协议。联合钢铁工人工会主席在三十日午夜发表的声明中指责钢铁公司当局应当对这次全国性的停工负完全责任。
    据透露，在谈判过程中，工会方面提出签订一项为期三年的工资合同，在合同的第一年，每小时增加工资两角美元。这些要求遭到资方的拒绝。工会方面还提出关于休假日工作增加工资和其他福利要求。这些要求也大部分为资方所拒绝。
    在谈判的最后几天，工会方面曾建议把目前的合同的截止时间从六月三十日延长到七月十七日，以便双方继续谈判寻求解决办法，但是这个建议也遭到资方拒绝，钢铁公司方面并且从六月二十八日起就开始封火和把鼓风炉冷却，以等待工人罢工的姿态来威胁工人。
