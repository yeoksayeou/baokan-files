    In recent times, small vendors, who constitute a significant proportion of private businesses in our country, have encountered new difficulties in their business operations. According to statistics from various regions, approximately 25% of small vendors are experiencing difficulties; in a few places, the percentage is even higher. Taking the most effective measures to help these small vendors overcome their difficulties has become an important task in the current socialist transformation of private commerce.
    After the implementation of the all-industry public-private partnership and the all-industry collectivization of private industry and commerce, the business conditions of small vendors operating independently and bearing their own profits and losses have undergone fundamental changes. On the one hand, they cannot, or cannot fully, obtain goods as they did in the past. In the past, they could purchase some goods from local artisans or process them; after the artisans were organized, the supply of these goods decreased, or even disappeared. In the past, they could also buy many scattered agricultural and sideline products from individual farmers; after the farmers were organized, these sideline products also decreased or disappeared. In the past, they could also purchase some miscellaneous daily necessities from small wholesalers in other places; after the socialist transformation of small wholesalers, this source of goods has also greatly decreased. In the past, when they had financial difficulties, they could sell some goods on credit to artisans and small wholesalers; now, this credit relationship has basically been interrupted. On the other hand, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions have not properly allocated them a certain amount of business, have not fully supplied them with marketable goods, have not promptly adjusted the wholesale and retail price differences of the goods they sell, and have not appropriately increased their handling fees. Banks and tax authorities have also failed to give them the necessary consideration, support, and convenience based on the new situation.
    Small vendors have complaints about these problems not being resolved in a timely manner. Guangdong Province held a meeting of small vendor representatives, which summarized their opinions into the following six issues: 1. No one to manage, difficulty in obtaining goods; 2. Insufficient funds, unable to obtain loans; 3. Heavy tax burden, unbearable; 4. Too many accounts and procedures, too troublesome; 5. Ridicule from the masses, saying that small vendors are backward; 6. Shops are too small, customers do not come. Comrade Chen Yun, in his speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, summarized the demands of small vendors into four points: First, a demand for a supply of goods; second, a demand for loan funds; third, a demand for simplified taxation; and fourth, a demand to enter socialism. These demands are reasonable, and the government has a responsibility to gradually satisfy them.
    If small vendors are not organized, it will be impossible to help them overcome various difficulties. At present, many small vendors have joined public-private partnership stores with fixed interest and cooperative stores. For the majority of small vendors who have not yet joined, they can be gradually, in stages and in groups, and by trade, organized into cooperative groups that operate independently and bear their own profits and losses. These cooperative groups should include not only those who currently purchase and sell on behalf of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, but also those who find their own sources of goods. As long as they are willing, they can be organized into groups of ten or twenty households. In smaller cities or regions with fewer businesses, organizing across industries according to business areas is better than not organizing at all.
    Cooperative groups are led by state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperative retail departments, or public-private partnership stores designated by local commercial departments, and these stores serve as the wholesale stores for the cooperative groups. The cooperative groups have the freedom to choose the goods wholesale stores supply. If the wholesale stores do not carry the goods the cooperative groups need, they should actively seek sources of goods or assist them in purchasing them themselves. The wholesale starting point of the wholesale stores should be appropriately lowered to facilitate the purchase of goods by small vendors.
    In addition to ensuring that small vendors have a sufficient supply of goods, wholesale stores also have the responsibility to help small vendors overcome other difficulties. The security deposits paid by small vendors to state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives for agency sales are considerable, and can now be returned to them. If the funds are still insufficient, the wholesale stores can apply for loans from banks on their behalf. The taxes payable by members of the cooperative group can be collected and paid to the tax authorities by the wholesale store on their behalf. The taxes of small vendors can be paid according to the method of fixed-term and fixed-amount taxation, without the need to adopt evaluation or similar evaluation methods. In addition to this, wholesale stores also have the responsibility to lead cooperative groups to exchange experiences, improve business management, and help cooperative groups with better business performance accumulate some public welfare funds.
    The purpose of adopting the above-mentioned methods is to ensure that small vendors have some business to do, that the needs of consumers can be met, and that the livelihood of small vendors can be maintained. Local state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should appropriately divide the business scope of state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, public-private partnership stores, cooperative stores, and cooperative groups, so that small vendors can retain a considerable amount of business. If, after dividing the business scope, it is still difficult for small vendors to maintain themselves, consideration can be given to appropriately expanding the price differences of goods with excessively small wholesale and retail price differences, especially scattered small commodities, within the price approval authority of each region, to ensure that members of the cooperative group have the necessary income. In individual regions, if the difficulties of some small vendors cannot be overcome by adopting these methods, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives can appropriately merge some retail departments, give up part of the market to arrange for small vendors, or absorb some small vendors as employees of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. In individual regions where there are too many commercial personnel, the higher-level leading organs should consider the overall situation and transfer them to regions where there are fewer commercial personnel but are in urgent need.
    Why not adopt the method of absorbing small vendors to participate in public-private partnership stores and cooperative stores to arrange for them, but instead adopt these complex and diverse measures? This is because these small vendors are widely scattered in residential areas, engaging in mobile buying and selling, which can facilitate consumers in many ways, and is a form of business service that our country needs for a long time. If they are allowed to continue to operate independently, and state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives issue fixed wages, it will be difficult to maintain their enthusiasm for business, and consumers will still feel very inconvenient. Adopting the above-mentioned methods, so that the vast number of small vendors are led by wholesale stores to form cooperative groups, and are closely linked to the socialist economy, and receive handling fees of the nature of piece-rate wages for purchasing and selling on behalf of socialist commerce, can gradually transform them into a part of socialist commerce.

### 帮助小商贩克服困难

    帮助小商贩克服困难
    最近一个时期以来，占我国私营商业户比例很大的小商贩，在业务经营上遇到了一些新的困难。根据各地的统计，小商贩发生困难的，占总户数的25％左右；少数地方还要多些。采取最有效的办法帮助这些小商贩克服困难，已经成为目前对私营商业进行社会主义改造工作中的一个重要的任务。
    私营工商业实行全行业公私合营和全行业合作化以后，分散经营、各负盈亏的小商贩的经营情况，发生了根本的变化。一方面，他们不能或者不完全能像过去那样获得货源了。过去，他们可以向当地手工业者采购一些商品或者进行加工，手工业组织起来以后，这部分商品供应减少了，甚至没有了。过去，他们还可以从个体农民手里买到许多零星农副产品，农民组织起来以后，这些副产品也减少了或者没有了。过去，他们还可以向小批发商购买一些外地零星日用杂货，小批发商经过社会主义改造以后，这个货源也大大减少了。过去，他们资金困难的时候，可以向手工业者和小批发商赊销部分商品，现在，这种赊销关系基本上中断了。另一方面，许多地区的国营商业和供销合作社没有适当地给他们分配一定的营业额，没有充分地供应他们适销的货物，没有及时给他们调整出售商品的批发零售差价，没有适当地给他们增加手续费。银行和税务机关也没有根据新的情况给他们必要的照顾、支持和便利。
    这些问题没有及时得到解决，小商贩是有意见的。广东省召开过小商贩代表会议，把他们的意见集中起来，有如下六个问题：一、无人管理，货源困难；二、资金不足，贷不到款；三、税负评的重，吃不消；四、账目和手续多，太麻烦；五、群众讥笑，说小商贩落后；六、店子太小，顾客不上门。陈云同志在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言中，把小商贩的要求归纳成四点：一是要求供应货源；二是要求借贷资金；三是要求简化税制；四是要求进入社会主义。这些要求是合理的，政府有责任逐步满足他们的这些要求。
    如果不把小商贩组织起来，就不可能帮助他们克服各种困难。现在，有不少小商贩已经参加了公私合营的定息的商店和合作商店。对于大多数还没有参加的小商贩可以逐步地、分期分批地、分行分业地把他们组成分散经营、各负盈亏的合作小组。这种合作小组不仅包括现在替国营商业、供销合作社代购代销的户，而且也可以包括自找货源的自营户。只要他们自愿，就可以十户、二十户一组地组织起来。在较小的城市或某些商户较少的地区，按营业地区跨行业组织，也比不组织好。
    合作小组由各地商业部门指定的国营商店、供销合作社门市部或公私合营商店领导，这些商店就作为合作小组的批发店。这些批发店批发的货物，合作小组有选购的自由。合作小组需要的商品，批发店如果不经营，那就应当积极寻找货源，或者协助他们去自行采购。批发店的批发起点要适当降低，以便利小商贩进货。
    除了保障小商贩有充足的货源以外，批发店还有责任帮助小商贩克服别的困难。小商贩缴给国营商店、供销合作社的代销保证金有相当的数量，现在可以还给他们。如果资金还不够，批发店可以代他们向银行贷款。合作小组成员应缴的税款可以汇集起来，由批发店代向税务机关交纳。小商贩的税款可以按照定期定额的税收办法交纳，不必采取评议或类似评议的办法。除此以外，批发店还有责任领导合作小组交流经验，改善经营管理，并且帮助营业情况较好的合作小组积累一些公益金。
    采用上面说的这些办法的目的，是保证小商贩有一定的生意可作，使消费者的需要可以满足，使小商贩的生活可以维持。各地国营商业、供销合作社要适当地把国营商店、供销合作社、公私合营商店、合作商店同合作小组的经营范围划分一下，使小商贩能够保有相当的营业额。如果划分营业范围以后，小商贩还难以维持，就可以考虑在各个地区的物价批准权限以内，把批发、零售差价过小的商品，特别是零星小商品的差价，适当地扩大，以保证合作小组成员有必要的收入。在个别地区，采用了这些办法，有的小商贩的困难还不能克服，国营商业、供销合作社可以适当合并一部分门市部，让出部分市场安排小商贩，或者吸收一部分小商贩充当国营商业、供销合作社的从业人员。个别地区商业人员过多的，应该由上级领导机关通盘考虑，向商业人员较少而又迫切需要的地区加以调配。
    为什么不采取吸收小商贩参加公私合营商店、合作商店的办法安排他们，而偏要采取这种复杂、多样的措施呢？这是因为这些小商贩广泛分散在居民区中，进行流动性的买卖，能够从多方面便利消费者，是我国商业中长期需要的一种经营服务形式，如果让他们继续分散经营，而由国营商业、供销合作社发给固定工资，那就难以保持他们经营的积极性，消费者仍然会感到很不便利。采用上面说的这些办法，使广大的小商贩由批发店领导组成合作小组，同社会主义经济密切地联系起来，从社会主义商业领取代购代销的、计件工资性质的手续费，就可以把他们逐步改造成为社会主义商业的一部分。
