Using Atomic Energy to Treat and Save Lives
    ——A Visit to the Central Institute of X-Ray and Radiology of the Ministry of Public Health of the Soviet Union——
    Lin Wei

    On May 19th, as the White Nights (summer nights that are not dark, locally known as White Nights) were approaching in Leningrad, we visited the Central Institute of X-Ray and Radiology of the Ministry of Public Health of the Soviet Union. The institute is located in a quiet courtyard with many trees in Leningrad, which belonged to an aristocratic military officer before the October Revolution.

    Thanks to the kindness of Professor Pobezhinsky (Doctor), the director, and Professor Kishelev (Doctor), the deputy director, we toured the laboratories, testing rooms, treatment rooms, and wards. Our questions were answered in detail, and we even took a photo with the two professors.

    Everything I saw in this institute convinced me that atomic energy, the greatest scientific discovery and crystallization of human wisdom, will eventually pave its own way in the direction of benefiting mankind, and billions of people will protect this direction and path. Some madmen want to absurdly use this crystallization of human wisdom for mass slaughter, creating unprecedented disasters for mankind, and they will inevitably be ultimately rejected by the people. The people will eventually completely master atomic energy and use it to eliminate disasters and diseases for mankind.

    Cancer, this malignant tumor, has always been a terrible disease, as frightening as death itself. Whoever suffers from this disease almost has to stare and wait for death, as medicine has been helpless. The situation with polycythemia vera is similar. However, the application of atomic energy in medicine, the application of radioactive cobalt, radioactive phosphorus, iodine, and other elements, is beginning to turn many of these "incurable" diseases into curable ones. The terrible disease demon is beginning to be conquered by the power of atomic radiation. Human wisdom has achieved unprecedented victories in the fight against natural forces. Professor Pobezhinsky, calm as ever, told us with enthusiasm when talking about the research results in this area: since 1950, for six years, the Soviet medical community has been exploring the use of radioactive isotopes to examine the causes of various serious diseases and to treat these diseases. So far, the cure rate for skin cancer has reached 96%, and even long-term patients can be cured. If internal cancers (such as uterine cancer) are discovered and sent to the hospital in time, the cure rate can also reach 80% with radioactive element treatment. In the past, radioactive cobalt was mostly used to treat cancer, and radium was used to a small extent. Now they have found a more effective element - radioactive strontium. Radioactive phosphorus is very effective in treating polycythemia vera. Radioactive iodine is also very effective in treating thyroid diseases.

    When we changed into white coats for the tour of the treatment area, the medical staff allowed us to browse through many case histories. Some were cases of lung cancer that could block human trachea and cause suffocation, but after treatment with radioactive cobalt, they had returned to their original state. Some were cases of fatal polycythemia vera, which gradually decreased and healed after drinking radioactive phosphorus. There were also cases of tumors around the heart, stomach tumors, and scattered lung tumors, all of which had been cured with radioactive cobalt. In addition, there were cases of using radioactive elements to treat surgical diseases - cervical tuberculosis, tuberculosis of the temples, lips, and nose, as well as cases of tuberculosis turning into cancer. All of these had before-and-after comparison photos. Some of these patients had been cured for five or six years and had never relapsed.

    In addition, the medical staff also let us read some thank-you letters written by cured patients. There are three wards directly managed by the institute for treating the above-mentioned diseases, with a total of one hundred and forty beds. The wards we visited all had good protection equipment: radioactive elements were placed in lead casings, and acted on the human body under very strict control. Medical staff and patients being treated were separated by walls with doors, and there was a small glass hole in the wall through which doctors could observe the patient's condition. There were also devices for doctors and patients to talk to each other, and instruments for recording changes in the patient's condition (such as heartbeat and breathing). When we visited, some male and female patients were lying down for treatment. One woman was being treated for cancer. A girl whose neck had absorbed radioactive material came over to shake hands with us. When the doctor brought an instrument close to her neck, it immediately made a rapid "da-da-da-da" sound.

    I silently blessed these patients: although they unfortunately suffered from serious diseases, they were lucky in two ways: one was being born in an era when atomic energy had already been discovered, and the other was being born in the Soviet Union.

    To treat diseases, one must know which disease to use which element and which ray, and how much radiation the patient needs. Without clarifying these, not only will it not cure the disease, but it will also cause harm. In order to exert the useful functions of radioactive isotopes, while avoiding the possible harm they may cause to people, many instruments and protective facilities are needed. These instruments and protective facilities must be researched and trial-produced independently, because this is a scientific innovation, and there is nothing readily available to use. In this regard, the institute has also made great contributions. When the director of the physical and technical laboratory, the elderly Mr. Fei Okejistov, received us in his laboratory, he introduced us to the instruments they had made themselves one by one and gave us demonstrations. The director of the radioactive laboratory, Mr. Bashelov, also introduced and demonstrated the various instruments in their laboratory. The director of the institute told us that they now have a total of nine such laboratories, but unfortunately we did not have enough time to visit them all.

    Professor Pobezhinsky told us that radioactive medicine is developing rapidly in the Soviet Union. Five years ago, there were only one or two such research institutes and medical institutions in Moscow and Leningrad; now, almost every state has one or two such institutions. This cause is developing in all republics and large cities without exception. In Moscow and Leningrad, the number of such institutions has grown to dozens. They are located in hospitals that treat cancer, skin diseases, and thyroid diseases. If other hospitals have such patients, they can be sent to these hospitals for treatment. To date, twenty-five radioactive elements have been used to treat various diseases of humans and animals, and new isotopes are being studied. For elements that have already been used, research is being conducted to expand their therapeutic range and use them to treat more diseases. Research is now also being conducted on the use of radioactive elements in eye diseases and diseases of the nervous system. Those who participate in radioactive medicine research are not only scholars, but also general medical workers, including many young people. The Soviet people have the highest enthusiasm for using atomic energy to treat and save lives.

    The rapid development of this cause is not only because it is the most noble cause in people's minds, but also because it has the full support of the Soviet government. For example, an instrument for calculating the number of atoms costs 200,000 rubles to manufacture (in the Soviet Union, this is equivalent to the price of twenty cars), and this is not the most expensive instrument. All of these instruments are paid for by the government. Of course, there are many other expenses. The government is spending so much money not for profit, but to develop this great cause that benefits all mankind. All the above-mentioned medical institutions that use radioactive elements do not charge money for curing people; treatment here is completely free. Therefore, ordinary workers and farmers can enjoy this treatment. Professor Pobezhinsky told us in passing when talking about this point that he had recently visited Britain and Sweden, where individual hospitals are now also using radioactive isotopes to treat certain diseases, but the cost is very high, so only a very, very small number of wealthy people can enjoy this treatment. This situation, of course, does not allow the rapid development of radioactive medicine and medical care in those places. If science is compared to a train, it seems that this train must have socialism and people's democracy as its tracks in order to run forward at high speed.

    In the development of Soviet radioactive medicine and medical care, this institute plays an important role. According to the two directors, the Central Institute not only conducts its own research and treatment work, but also transmits the institute's research results to medical institutions throughout the Soviet Union for their application; at the same time, it also provides equipment and technical assistance to local institutions, acting as their advisor. The Central Institute is responsible for convening all-Soviet doctors' representative conferences (in order to cultivate young people, sometimes it also specifically convenes young medical workers' representative conferences) to study various issues related to the use of radioactive isotopes to treat diseases. The Central Institute often organizes lectures and reports in this area, inviting medical workers in the city to attend; it also invites personnel from local medical institutions to come here to study and intern, to train personnel for them (the time is generally two months). The Central Institute also publishes various professional journals such as "Radioactive Medicine," in which leaders and staff in this field write articles to exchange and disseminate research results and work experience. Last year, they published one hundred special articles in this area; this year, they have already published fifty-six. The comrades of the Central Institute also used the method of collective creation to write professional books such as "The Role of Radioactive Cobalt in Medical Treatment" as a tool for training more personnel.

    As our visit was nearing its end, the two directors took out a photographed letter to show us. It was a short letter written by Comrade Huang Jiasi, the head of the Chinese medical delegation. They cherished the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people very much, so they had the letter photographed and preserved. The letter said that this institute "has made significant contributions in the design of new instruments and equipment, in the theoretical exploration of the effects of radioactivity on organisms and the human body and the research of protective measures, in the use of isotopes to fight against various serious diseases, and in the training of medical radiology cadres."

    I think all of these contributions are not only contributions to medicine, but also contributions to the entire world peace and socialist cause. Every drop of achievement here will cast an influence among the people, making them more convinced that atomic energy should be used unreservedly for the cause of benefiting mankind. The more such a cause develops, the more those madmen who want to use atomic energy for mass slaughter will be hated and condemned, and the more their sinister plans will suffer setbacks, until they are completely bankrupt. And what socialism ultimately means will be understood by more and more people.

    To the simple and sincere leaders and staff of this institute, although I only spent a few hours with them, I will always think of them with gratitude. I feel that they are all very noble people. The development of the cause they are engaged in will continue to bring good news to mankind!

    利用原子能治病救人
    ——访问苏联保健部中央爱克斯线和放射学研究所——
    林韦
    在列宁格勒的白夜（夏季夜间不黑，当地俗称白夜）快要到来的时候，五月十九日，我们访问了苏联保健部中央爱克斯线和放射学研究所。这个研究所设在列宁格勒市内一所幽静的树木很多的院落里，十月革命以前这院落属于一个贵族军官。
    由于所长波别金斯基教授（博士）和副所长基舍列夫教授（博士）的好意，我们在这里参观了试验室、化验室、医疗室、病室；我们所询问的问题得到了详细的答复；并且同二位教授一块照了像。
    在这个研究所里看到的一切，使我相信原子能这个科学上最伟大的发现，人类智慧的结晶，终将沿着为人类造福的方向为它自己开辟道路，亿万人民将保护这个方向和道路。有一些狂人想要把这项人类智慧的结晶荒谬地用于大量屠杀人类，给人类制造空前的灾难，他们将不可避免地最后被人民唾弃。人民将最后把原子能完全掌握在自己手里，使它为人类消除灾难和病害。
    癌肿，这种恶性的肿瘤，历来是同死神一样可怕的一种恶病。谁害了这病，谁就几乎要瞪着眼等死，医学上束手无策。赤血球增多病的情形也差不多。但是，原子能在医学上的应用，放射性钴和放射性磷、碘等各种元素的应用，开始把这许多“不治”之症变成可治之症。可怕的病魔开始被原子幅射能力征服了。人类的智慧在对自然力进行斗争中取得了空前的胜利。冷静的波别金斯基教授在谈到这方面的研究成果的时候，用热烈的口吻告诉我们：从1950年开始，六年以来，苏联医学界一直在探讨利用放射性同位素来检查各种严重疾病的病原，并且医治这些疾病。到现在为止，皮肤癌症的治愈率已经达到96％，就是长期患者也能治好。内部癌症（如子宫癌等）如果发现以后能够及时送院，用放射性元素治疗，治愈率也可以达到80％。治疗癌症过去多用放射性钴，一小部分用镭，现在他们又找到一种更有效的元素——放射性锶。赤血球增多症，用放射性磷来治疗非常有效。甲状腺的疾病，用放射性碘来医治也有极好的效果。
    在我们换了白衣参观治疗的时候，医疗人员让我们翻阅了许多病例。其中有的是能够阻塞人类气管使人窒息而死的肺癌，用放射性钴治疗以后，已经恢复原状。有的是可以致死的赤血球增多症，喝了放射性磷以后逐渐下降而痊愈。还有的是心脏周围癌肿，胃癌肿，肺部分散癌肿，都已经用放射性钴治好。此外还有利用放射性元素治疗外科病——颈部结核，鬓部、嘴唇、鼻子结核，以及由结核变成癌症的病例。所有这些，都有病时和治愈以后对比的照片。其中有一些病人治好以后已经五、六年从未再犯。
    另外，医疗人员还让我们翻阅了一部分治好了的病人写来的感谢信。这个研究所直接领导的治疗上述疾病的病室有三处，共一百四十个床位。我们所参观的各个病室，都有很好的防护设备：放射性元素被装置在铅包中间，在十分严密的控制下起作用于人体。医疗人员和被医疗的病人，用墙隔开，中间有门，墙上还有一个玻璃小孔，医生从小孔中观察病人的情况。还有医生和病人通话的设备，有专门记录病情变化（如心脏跳动和呼吸情况等）的仪器。在我们参观的时候，有些男女病人正在躺着医治，有一个女人是治疗癌肿的。还有一个颈部吸收了放射性物质的姑娘走来同我们握手。医生用一个仪器接近她的颈部，立刻发出急速的“达达达达”的响声。
    我默默地为这些病人祝福：他们虽然不幸得了严重的疾病，但却有两个方面是幸运的：一方面是生在原子能已经被发现的时代，另一方面是生在苏维埃国家。
    要治疗疾病，就要知道哪种疾病用哪种元素，哪种射线，病人需要多少射线。不弄清这些，不但不能治病，还会造成伤害。为了发挥放射性同位素的有用的功能，同时避免它可能给人的危害，那就需要有许多的仪器和防护设施，这些仪器和防护设施完全要自己来研究，试制，因为这是一种科学上的创举，并无现成的东西可以拿来就用。在这一方面，这个研究所也作了很大的贡献。物理技术化验室主任非欧克吉斯多夫老人在他的化验室中接见我们的时候，一个个地给我们介绍了他们自制的仪器，并且作了表演。放射性试验室主任巴谢洛夫，也介绍和表演了他们试验室的各种仪器。研究所所长告诉我们，他们现在一共有九个这样的实验室，可惜我们时间太少，不能一一参观。
    波别金斯基教授告诉我们：放射性医学现在正在苏联迅速发展着。五年以前，还只是莫斯科和列宁格勒有一、二个这样的研究所和医疗机关；现在则几乎每一个州都有了一、二个这样的机关。各共和国和大的城市，这一事业无例外地都在发展。莫斯科和列宁格勒，这种机构已经发展到数十个。它们设在治疗癌症、皮肤病和甲状腺病的医院。别的医院有这类病人，可以送到这些医院来治疗。到目前止，已经有二十五种放射性元素被用来治疗人和兽的各种疾病，而新的同位素又在被研究着。对于已被利用的元素，则在研究扩大它们的治疗范围，用它们治疗更多种疾病。在眼病和神经系统的疾病方面，现在也已经在研究使用放射性元素。参加放射性医学研究的人，并不只是学者，其中也有一般的医疗工作者，包括许多青年在内。对于利用原子能来治病救人，苏联人有最高的热情。
    这一事业的迅速发展，不仅因为它是人们心目中最崇高的事业，而且因为有苏联政府的全力支持。举例说，有一种计算原子数量的仪器，制造一个要二十万卢布（在苏联，这就等于二十辆小汽车的价格），而这并不是最贵的仪器。所有这些仪器，都是政府掏钱。其他费用当然还很多。政府拿出这许多钱，并不是为了利润，而是为了发展这一有益于全人类的伟大事业。所有上述利用放射性元素的医疗机关，并不因为自己给人治好了病而索取金钱，这里的治疗是完全免费的。所以一般的工人、农民都能享受这种治疗。波别金斯基教授在说到这一点的时候顺便告诉我们，他不久以前曾经到英国和瑞典参观，那里现在也有个别的医院使用放射性同位素治疗某些疾病，但费用很大，所以只有极少极少的有钱人可以享受这种治疗。这种状况，当然不能使那里的放射性医学和医疗事业迅速发展。如果把科学比作列车，这列车看来必须有社会主义和人民民主制度作为轨道，才能以高速度向前奔驰。
    在苏联放射性医学和医疗事业的发展中，这个研究所起着重要的作用。据二位所长谈，中央研究所一方面自己进行研究和治疗工作，同时也把研究所得传达给全苏的各个医疗机构，供它们应用；同时还在设备上、技术上帮助地方性机构，给它们当顾问。中央研究所负责召集全苏医生代表会议（为了培养青年，有时还专门召开青年医疗工作者代表会议），研究利用放射性同位素治病的各种问题。中央研究所时常组织这方面的讲演和报告，吸收本市的医疗工作者来听讲；也吸收地方医疗机关的人员来这里学习、实习，为它们培养人材（时间一般是二个月）。中央研究所还出版“放射性医学”等各种专业杂志，由这方面的领导人员和工作人员写文章来交流和传播研究成果和工作经验。去年一年，它们发表了一百篇这方面的专文；今年又已发表五十六篇。中央研究所的同志们还利用集体创作的方法，写了“放射性钴在医疗中的作用”等专业书籍，作为培养更多人材的工具。
    二位所长在我们访问快要结束的时候，拿出一份拍了照的信件给我们看，这是中国医学代表团团长黄家驷同志写来的一封短信。他们非常珍贵中苏人民的友谊，所以把信拍了照保存着。信中说，这个研究所“在新仪器装置的设计上，在放射性对生物和人体影响的理论探讨和防护措施的研究上，在利用同位素和各种严重疾病作斗争上，以及在医学放射学干部的培养上，都作了重大的贡献。”
    所有这些贡献，我想，都不只是对于医学的贡献，而且也是对于整个世界和平和社会主义事业的贡献。这里的每一滴成就，都将在人民中间投下一种影响，使人民更加相信原子能应当毫无保留地用于为人类造福的事业。这样的事业愈发展，那些想把原子能用于大量屠杀人类的狂人就愈会受到憎恨和谴责，他们的罪恶计划就愈会遭受挫折，直到最后完全破产。而社会主义究竟意味着什么，也就愈会为更多的人民所理解。
    对于这个研究所的质朴的诚挚的领导者和工作人员们，我虽然只跟他们相处了几个小时，但我将永远用感激的心情想到他们。我觉得他们都是非常高尚的人。他们所从事的事业的发展，将不断地给人类带来福音！
