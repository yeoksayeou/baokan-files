Local Newspaper Commentary Summary

“Dense Grass Can’t Stop Organized Hands”

The Shaanxi Daily prominently featured the active weeding of late autumn fields by the Yongjiu Agricultural Cooperative in Xingping County on July 16th, publishing an editorial titled "Dense Grass Can’t Stop Organized Hands."

The editorial stated: Recently, in some agricultural cooperatives, weeds in late autumn fields were growing faster than the seedlings, even taller in some cases. The members considered it difficult and labor-intensive to weed, so they advocated simply plowing it over and replanting. The reason they wanted to plow the autumn fields was largely due to their initial lack of emphasis on autumn fields, believing that "the three months of autumn don’t match one summer." Therefore, it is necessary to clearly explain to the farmers that as long as the work is done well, autumn fields can still yield a bountiful harvest. Especially this year, some areas suffered from continuous rain during the summer harvest, resulting in wheat losses. To complete the annual production increase plan and ensure that members' incomes increase, it is even more important to find ways to compensate for the losses from the summer harvest in the autumn fields.

This year, in most areas of Shaanxi, due to prolonged rainfall, there were many and vigorous weeds in the autumn fields, making weeding laborious. Moreover, the various agricultural tasks at hand were still tight and intense, making it difficult for some agricultural cooperatives to allocate labor. Can the seedling shortage phenomenon be eliminated? The editorial pointed out that as long as we strengthen our efforts, rationally utilize every labor force, and mobilize the members to quickly launch a concentrated weeding and cultivation campaign, it is possible to manage the autumn fields well. The Yongjiu Cooperative is one example. The editorial also cited the example of the Panzhou Cooperative in Xuelu Township, Qian County, where the first production team, after properly arranging labor, weeded eighteen acres of autumn fields in one day.

The editorial stated: It is precisely at this time that rural work cadres should personally understand where the superiority of the agricultural cooperative lies and how to mobilize strength. If something that could have been done originally resulted in reduced autumn field income due to our failure to grasp and lead in a timely manner, then that is our fault.

Learn from the Lesson of Neglected Seedlings

The Yian Large Area Inspection Team of the CCP Jiexiu County Committee in Shanxi Province, while inspecting autumn seedlings in Donghulong Township, discovered a serious seedling shortage phenomenon in the Nanwangli Village Agricultural Cooperative of this township. 70% of the cooperative's 480 acres of cotton fields had not been weeded a second time, and as many as 150 acres had not even been thinned; in addition, 69 acres of corn had grown to three or four feet tall but had not been thinned. The Shanxi Daily published an editorial titled "Learn from the Lesson of Reduced Production Due to Neglected Seedlings in Nanwangli Cooperative" on July 16th. The editorial pointed out: The most fundamental lesson lies in the fact that the work team stationed in the cooperative and the cooperative cadres were indifferent, negligent, and careless in their daily production leadership. It seems that the main issue is not the cadres' lack of leadership ability, but rather the lack of a due sense of responsibility for the production work of a collective economic organization like the cooperative. Their leadership of daily production mostly involved making statements at meetings or only setting general plans. As for which piece of land was managed by which team, whether weeding was completed well, and similar practical production situations, they were unaware because they had not made specific arrangements in advance and rarely conducted in-depth inspections in the fields afterward.

The editorial stated: The lesson of reduced production due to neglected seedlings in the Nanwangli Cooperative also exposes another aspect of the problem, which is that the internal production management system of the cooperative is very unsound. In addition to the fact that the production responsibility system has not been clearly established and the lack of planning in daily production work, the biggest problem is the failure to implement the principle of "payment according to labor, more work more pay." As a result, the attendance rate of members is extremely low, and they tend to choose easy tasks and avoid difficult ones during weeding, and labor efficiency is not high. To mobilize all available labor to participate in this struggle, accelerate the speed of eliminating the seedling shortage phenomenon, and ensure improved quality, it is necessary to remember the lesson of the Nanwangli Cooperative and overcome all unreasonable phenomena in production management. The editorial pointed out: After inspection, the Nanwangli Cooperative is rapidly applying additional fertilizer to the autumn crops with reduced production due to the seedling shortage, striving to increase production despite the reduction, which is excellent. All cooperatives with serious seedling shortages should learn from their approach.

Guarantee Autumn Field Topdressing

The Henan Daily published an editorial titled "Weeding and Composting, Guaranteeing Increased Production" on July 19th. The editorial stated: Due to the expansion of cultivated area by agricultural production cooperatives and the increased planting of high-yield crops, the fertilizer needed for autumn fields is generally insufficient. In the past, due to the intensity of summer production, farmers could only accumulate a little fertilizer during the "hanging up the hoe" period; now, cooperatives can fully organize a certain amount of labor in the summer to accumulate the fertilizer needed for autumn field topdressing. Between summer and autumn, the main method of accumulating fertilizer is weeding and composting. In coal-burning areas, in addition to leaving enough livestock feed, a portion of wheat straw can also be used for high-temperature composting.

    地方报纸评论摘要
    “草稠，挡不住组织起来的手稠”
    陕西日报七月十六日以头条地位表扬了兴平县永久农业社抓紧晚秋地锄草的积极行动，并以“草稠，挡不住组织起来的手稠”为题发表社论。
    社论说：最近，有些农业社的晚秋地草苗争长，甚至草比苗高，社员们认为难锄、怕费工，就主张干脆犁掉重种。他们所以想翻掉秋田，很大成分是由于思想上本来就对秋田不重视，认为“三秋不顶一夏”。因此要向农民很好地讲清楚：只要作务好，秋田一样可以得到丰收。特别是今年有的地方在夏收时遭了阴雨的灾害，小麦受损失，要完成全年增产计划，使社员收入都能增加，就更要想办法把夏田的损失从秋田中去找补回来。
    今年陕西大部分地区由于长期阴雨，秋田里的草又多又旺，锄起来费工夫；而眼前各项农活也仍然是又挤又紧张，有的农业社劳力因此调配不开。究竟苗荒现象能不能消除呢？社论指出：只要我们加强努力，合理利用每个劳动力，发动社员迅速开展一个突击中耕锄草运动，是可以把秋田务好的。永久社是一个例子。社论中还举了乾县薛禄乡盘周社的例子，这个社第一生产队妥善安排劳力以后，在一天内就把十八亩秋田中的草拔了一遍。
    社论说：农村工作干部正是在这个时候，应该亲自摸一下农业社的优越性究竟在哪里，怎样才能把力量动员起来。如果原来可以办到的事，由于我们没有及时抓紧领导，减少了秋田的收入，这就是我们的过错。
    接受荒苗教训
    中共山西介休县委义安大片检查组在东湖龙乡检查秋苗，发现这个乡的南王里村农业合作社有严重苗荒现象，全社四百八十亩棉田，70％没有锄二遍，其中竟有一百五十亩没有间过苗；另有六十九亩玉米已经长到三、四尺高却没有定苗。山西日报七月十六日为这件事情发表了“接受南王里社苗荒减产教训”的社论。社论指出：最根本的教训是在于驻社工作组和社干部，对于日常生产领导漫不经心、疏忽大意。看来，主要不是这些干部领导能力差，而是对于合作社这样一个集体经济组织的生产工作，缺乏应有的高度负责精神。他们对日常生产的领导，多是把话说在会议上，或只订在一般化的计划上。至于哪块地由哪个组负责经营，锄苗完成好坏，以及类似这些实际生产情况，因为事先没有具体安排，事后又很少深入田间检查，却不知道。
    社论说：南王里社苗荒减产的教训，还暴露了另外一方面的问题，这就是社内生产管理制度很不健全。该社除了生产责任制没有明确建立，和日常生产工作缺乏计划性以外，最大的毛病是没有贯彻执行“按劳计酬、多劳多得”的原则，因此社员出勤率极低，锄苗中挑易避难、劳动效率不高。要动员一切能够下地的劳动力都投入这一斗争，并加快消灭苗荒现象的速度，和保证提高质量，就必须记取南王里社的教训，克服生产管理上一切不合理现象。社论指出：南王里社经过检查，对于苗荒减产的秋作物，迅速上追肥补救，力争在减产中再求增产，这是很好的。所有苗荒严重的合作社，都应该学习他们这一作法。
    保证秋田追肥
    七月十九日河南日报发表了题为“除草沤肥，保证增产”的社论。社论说：由于农业生产合作社扩大了复种面积，多种了高产作物，因而秋田需要的肥料普遍不足。往年，因为夏季生产紧张，农民只能在“挂锄钩”的期间积一点肥；现在，合作社完全可以在夏季组织一定的力量，积攒秋田追肥所需要的肥料。在夏秋之间，积肥的主要办法，是除草沤肥。在烧煤地区，除留下足够的牲口饲料外，还可以利用一部分麦草等实行高温积肥。
