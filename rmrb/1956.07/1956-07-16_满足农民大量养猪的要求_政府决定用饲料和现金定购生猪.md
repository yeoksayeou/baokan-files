To Meet Farmers' Demands for Large-Scale Pig Raising
The Government Decides to Order Live Pigs with Feed and Cash

    (Our Dispatch) According to the State Council's instructions on developing pig raising, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and the People's Bank of China have decided to use feed grain and cash to order 17.5 million live pigs from farmers and agricultural cooperatives in key pig-producing areas in 24 provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hunan, Hebei, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from July 1956 to June 1957.

    Within this year, the Ministry of Food will allocate 1 billion jin of feed grain, and the People's Bank will provide loans of 50 million yuan, to be handed over to state-owned food companies for ordering live pigs. Agricultural cooperatives and farmers who voluntarily accept the orders will receive feed purchase certificates for 50 to 80 jin per pig, and they can purchase feed from local grain supply points at any time with the certificates. If they have difficulties with pig-raising funds, they can also accept cash orders, with a maximum deposit of 10 yuan per pig. Ordered households with insufficient pig feed and funds can receive a certain amount of feed and deposit at the same time.

    满足农民大量养猪的要求
    政府决定用饲料和现金定购生猪
    本报讯　商业部、粮食部和中国人民银行，根据国务院发展养猪的指示，决定在1956年7月至1957年6月，在江苏、四川、湖南、河北等二十四个省、市和内蒙古自治区的生猪重点产区，用饲料粮和现金向农民和农业社定购生猪一千七百五十万头。
    在这一年内，粮食部将拨出十亿斤饲料粮，人民银行贷款五千万元，交由国营食品公司定购生猪。自愿接受定购的农业社和农民，每头猪将得到五十至八十斤的定购饲料购买证，可以随时凭证向当地粮食供应点购买饲料。如果养猪资金有困难的，也可以接受现金订购，每头猪最高的可得定金十元。养猪饲料、资金都不足的定购户，可同时得到一定数量的饲料和定金。
