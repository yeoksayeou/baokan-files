    Conserve Every Inch of Steel by Calculating Materials Carefully
    Li Shou'an's team at the Cold Work Workshop of Harbin Electric Machinery Plant actively promoted diverse nesting methods in material cutting. From January to June, they saved the state six and a half tons of steel. Last year, Li Shou'an's team was awarded the honorary title of National Advanced Production Team for saving a large amount of steel. Starting in January this year, the workers in this team implemented a diverse nesting method for material cutting. For example, when making motor bases, the base plate and reinforcing ribs were cut together. One steel plate could produce more than fifty parts, increasing the steel utilization rate from 87% to 95%. Before each material cutting, they carefully studied the drawings and suggested revisions to the design department when they found any waste.
    In Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory, saving steel has become a common practice, with everyone paying attention to saving every inch of steel. The material distribution team in the cutting workshop picks out usable scrap from the scrap pile every month and sends it to the processing team for utilization. The returned scrap is also processed into finished products through methods such as "smothering," "tempering," and "turning round." This workshop also learned from advanced Soviet experience and used ordinary steel and processed scrap heads to replace high-speed steel for welding at the tail of end mills, milling cutters, and reamer products, ensuring the quality and service life of the products. Using these two methods, this workshop processed a total of 13,109 pieces of products, saving the state 4,125 tons of steel.
  Establish Scrap Steel Purchasing Stations
    In the first half of this year, the Qingdao Aquatic Products Company's Fishing Boat Repairing and Manufacturing Plant needed a large amount of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and it was difficult to rely entirely on state allocation. They sent cadres to other cities and their own city to establish purchasing stations and contacted relevant factories, government offices, schools, and enterprises to widely purchase various scrap steel materials.
    From January to now, this plant has purchased more than 200,000 catties of various old steel materials and cast steel. Using these old materials saves more than 44,000 yuan compared to using new materials, saving the state a large amount of steel and completing the shipbuilding task ahead of schedule without affecting the repair quality.
  Implement a Savings Reward System
    In the first half of this year, iron factories for farm implements in Shandong Province saved a total of more than 2,000 tons of steel.
    Shandong Farm Implement Factory implemented a reward system for ensuring quality and saving raw materials, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of employees in saving raw materials. Punching machine workers Xu Shiqi and Chi Zhenxue used their spare time to pick up some waste deep plough adjustment handles and waste safety hooks from the scrap iron pile and around the factory building, and made plough support plates, jacking screws, and tail wheel cotter pins. The factory saved more than 80 tons of steel in the second quarter alone. In the first half of this year, the employees of Dezhou Iron Factory saved more than 37 tons of steel just by utilizing material heads and ends. Some farm implement iron factories also mixed about 50% of recycled iron and scrap iron into some products, which also saved the state a lot of good steel raw materials.
    Youth Shock Brigade Collects Scrap
    The entire youth of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have collected more than 170 tons of scrap steel and scrap iron in the twenty days of July, supplying the plant's open hearth furnaces and blast furnaces for production.
    After the Youth League organization of this plant issued a call to young employees to collect scrap steel, it immediately received a response from the majority of young employees. Young people, based entirely on voluntary principles, organized many shock brigades and shock teams to participate in the collection of scrap steel in their spare time. Two hundred and forty young people in the Ironmaking Department formed five temporary shock brigades and thirteen shock teams, picking up 35 tons of scrap steel in five days of spare time. In addition to actively participating in the collection of scrap steel, the youth of the Steel Rolling Department also established a regular savings system with a "Youth Savings Handbook."
    Magnetic Tubes Replace Iron Conduits
    The Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute has successfully developed a magnetic tube that can replace iron conduits for electrical wiring in civil buildings. Using this magnetic tube can save the country a significant amount of ferrous metals.
    This magnetic tube is inexpensive and has many advantages: (1) Moisture and leakage will not occur inside the tube. (2) Because the magnetic tube itself is an insulator, it eliminates the need for safety grounding facilities and materials. (3) Using magnetic tubes instead of iron conduits can eliminate operations such as sawing pipes, threading, and applying lead oil.
    The Technical Committee of this Design Institute has decided to use magnetic tubes instead of iron conduits for electrical wiring in general civil buildings. According to the results of a trial use in a 6,500-square-meter project on one construction site, a total of 5,200 meters of iron conduit was saved for the country, and the cost was reduced by more than 4,100 yuan.
    Plywood Replaces Steel Plates
    Shenyang Local State-Owned Xinsheng Chemical Factory has successfully tested the use of plywood instead of steel plates to make packaging drums. The packaging effect of this plywood drum is exactly the same as that of a steel plate drum. Now, based only on the more than 1,000 packaging drums that have been made, it can save the country more than 7 tons of steel. The cost of each plywood drum is also about 18% lower than that of a drum made of steel plate. The vulcanization accelerator contained in the plywood drum is the same as that in the steel plate drum, and the quality has not changed.
  Bamboo Reinforcement Replaces Steel Reinforcement
    In civil construction projects in Tianjin, bamboo reinforcement is now being prepared to replace part of the steel reinforcement in concrete pouring. On July 19, at a technical research conference held by the Construction Engineering Bureau and various construction engineering companies, the scope of using bamboo reinforcement instead of steel reinforcement was preliminarily determined. At present, it will first be used on accessory buildings such as "door and window lintels" and other non-primary load-bearing components. In this way, it is estimated that a civil construction project can save about 20% of steel reinforcement.

    大力节约钢铁，充分采取代用品
    量材下料节约每一寸钢材
    哈尔滨电机厂冷作车间李守安小组，在下料中积极推行了多样套裁的方法，从一月到六月就为国家节省了六吨半钢材。李守安小组去年由于节约了大量钢材，曾经获得全国先进生产小组的光荣称号。这个小组的工人从今年一月份就实行了多样套裁下料法，例如做电动机机座时，机座板和拉筋一起下料，一块钢板就裁出五十多个部件，钢材利用率由87％提高到95％。他们在每次下料前，都认真地研究图纸，发现设计有浪费的地方，就建议设计部门修正过来。
    在哈尔滨第一工具厂，职工节约钢材已形成风气，人人都注意节省每一寸钢材。这个工厂切料车间配料小组，每个月都从废料堆中挑出能用的废料，发给加工组去加工利用，每月收回来的废品，也经过“闷火”、“回火”、“车圆”等方法，加工制成成品。这个车间还学习了苏联先进经验，在立铣刀、铣刀和绞刀产品的尾部，用普通钢和经过加工的废料头代替高速钢进行焊接，并且保证了产品的质量和使用寿命。这个车间用这两种方法共加工出了13，109件产品，给国家节省了4，125吨钢材。
  建立废钢收购站
    今年上半年，青岛水产公司渔轮修造厂需用黑色和有色金属的数量很大，全部依靠国家调拨有困难。他们便派出干部到外埠和本市建立收购站，同各有关工厂、机关、学校、企业取得联系，广泛收购各种废钢料。
    从一月份到现在，这个厂收购了各种旧钢材和铸钢二十多万斤。他们使用这些旧料，比用新料能节约四万四千多元，给国家省下大量钢材，并且在不影响修建质量的前提下，提前完成了造船任务。
  实行节约奖励制度
    今年上半年，山东省各农具铁工厂共节约钢铁两千多吨。
    山东农具厂实行了关于保证质量和节约原料的奖励制度，职工们节约原材料的热情很高。冲床工人徐世起、迟振学利用休息时间，到废铁堆里和厂房周围拣回一些废耕深调节把和废安全钩，制成了犁托支板、顶丝和尾轮插肖等物品。全厂仅在第二季度就节约钢材八十多吨。德州铁工厂的职工，今年上半年仅利用料头料尾一项，就节约钢铁三十七吨多。还有一些农具铁工厂在一部分产品中掺用了50％左右的再生铁和废铁，也为国家节省了很多好的钢铁原料。青年突击队收集废料
    太原钢铁厂的全体青年在七月份的二十天中，已经收集了一百七十多吨废钢、废铁，供应了厂里的平炉、高炉的生产。
    这个厂的青年团组织向青年职工发出了收集废钢铁的号召后，马上得到了广大青年职工的响应，青年们完全根据自愿原则，组织了许多突击队，突击小组，利用业余时间参加收集废钢铁的活动。炼铁部二百四十个青年组成了五个临时突击队、十三个突击小组，在五天的业余时间内拣了三十五吨废钢铁。轧钢部的青年除了积极参加收集废钢铁的活动外，还建立了“青年节约手册”的经常节约制度。
    磁管代替电线铁管
    北京市城市规划管理局设计院研究成功一种可以在民用建筑中代替电线铁管的磁管。使用这种磁管，可以为国家节省大量黑色金属。
    这种磁管价格便宜，而且具有许多优点：（一）管内不会发生潮湿和漏电现象。（二）由于磁管本身是一种绝缘体，便省去了安全接地线的设施和材料。（三）用磁管代替铁管可以省去锯管、套丝、抹铅油等操作工序。
    这个设计院的技术委员会已经决定在一般民用建筑中，采用磁管代替铁管来安装电线。根据一个工地在六千五百平方公尺工程中试用的结果，共为国家节约铁管五千二百公尺，造价降低四千一百多元。
    胶合板代替钢板
    沈阳市地方国营新生化工厂，试验成功用胶合板代替钢板做包装桶。这种胶合板桶的包装效果，完全和钢板桶一样。现在，仅就已经做出的一千多个包装桶计算，能给国家节省七吨多钢材。每个胶合板桶的成本也比钢板做的桶降低了18％左右。胶合板桶里所装的硫化促进剂和钢板桶里的一样，质量没有发生任何变化。
  竹筋代替钢筋
    在天津市的民用建筑工程中，现正准备采用竹筋代替部分钢筋浇筑混凝土。七月十九日，在建筑工程局和各建筑工程公司举行的技术研究会上，初步确定了以竹筋代替钢筋的范围，目前先在“门窗过梁”等非主要承重构件附属建筑物上使用。这样，预计一幢民用建筑工程即可以节省钢筋20％左右。
