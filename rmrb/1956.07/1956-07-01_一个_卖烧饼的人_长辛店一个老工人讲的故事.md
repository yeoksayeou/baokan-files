    A "Pancake Seller"
    — A Story Told by an Old Worker from Changxindian
    Liu Qun
    Carpenter Wang’s home was in Yu Huang Village, about two li away from the Changxindian Railway Factory. One day, Carpenter Wang passed by Pan's Pancake Shop, and the shopkeeper Pan introduced him to a young man, saying, "This is Lao Hu. He's a good person, but he's poor!" Carpenter Wang took one look at this man – medium height, wearing tattered clothes, with a fair complexion – and they hit it off right away. Lao Hu said, "I live outside the town, too far from the Changxindian factory, making it inconvenient to do small business. Carpenter Wang, could you help me find a place to live? The quieter the better..." Carpenter Wang was a warm-hearted man, and seeing that this man was decent, he agreed, "Just move into the west wing of my house. It’s as quiet as can be there, surrounded by graves, and close to the factory."

    On moving day, Carpenter Wang saw that Lao Hu had nothing but a ragged quilt that looked like it had been deep-fried in oil. He lent him a bed board and bought him a bag of flour. He also found a broken table, so Lao Hu could finally start a fire and cook.

    This young man was really strange. He sold pancakes during the day and read and wrote at night, never resting. Sometimes he chatted with the workers in the same courtyard until late into the night. Everyone in the courtyard could talk to him. The workers were also surprised: This Lao Hu, with his heavy southern accent, seemed to have come from somewhere else, but how was he so familiar with the lives of the workers in Changxindian? At that time, it was only a few years after the "February 7th" Massacre, and the railway workers of Changxindian were living a hard life, just like in the song that was later written:

    The Pinghan Railway turned into the Poor and Cold Railway,
    Unemployed workers淪落on the streets,
    The Liuli River became the River of Tears,
    Tears flowed more than the river water!
    Changxindian became the Heartbreak Shop,
    Heartbreaking things are endless.
    How could the workers keep warm?

    Little by little, Lao Hu, the pancake seller, became familiar with all the workers. At that time, the Red Army in Jiangxi was making a lot of noise with the revolution, and there were many rumors. One day, Carpenter Wang asked Lao Hu, "I heard the south is in a lot of trouble..." "Don't be afraid," Lao Hu said, "It will be good for us when the people from the south come here." Lao Hu was busy selling pancakes all day, barely getting enough to eat, and he would often eat at Carpenter Wang's house. In the winter, when it was snowing heavily outside, Lao Hu didn't have a cotton coat, so Carpenter Wang took off his own cotton pants and gave them to Lao Hu, trying to help him make a cotton coat. Lao Hu, in turn, took the time to teach Carpenter Wang's son, Deshan, to read every night.

    Once, the "Railway Worker Training Institute" was recruiting workers, and Lao Hu signed up to take the exam. Carpenter Wang acted as his guarantor. Lao Hu really didn't seem like a pancake seller; he came in first place on the exam. However, the personnel department of the Changxindian Railway Factory said, "We can't hire him."

    There was a reason for not hiring Lao Hu. The Kuomintang labor union at the Changxindian Railway Factory had already noticed this strange "pancake seller."

    One morning, Carpenter Wang went to the home of Xu Fu, the director of the Kuomintang labor union, to repair tables and benches. Xu Fu wasn't home, but his servant saw Carpenter Wang and said, "Carpenter Wang, you have to be careful. Xu Fu and Ma Jin are always looking for Communists; they might accuse anyone."

    When Carpenter Wang heard this, Lao Hu immediately flashed into his mind. Before he could finish the job, Xu Fu returned. When he saw Carpenter Wang, he smiled and said, "Carpenter Wang, it's your turn to get rich this time." Carpenter Wang was shocked: "I've been swinging my axe in the railway factory my whole life, and I'm still not rich." Xu Fu moved closer and said, "Do you know what that pancake seller living in your house is? He's a Communist! If you can find evidence to report him, you'll definitely get something out of it."

    Carpenter Wang's heart sank, but he didn't show it and said, "He's a poor pancake seller; how could he be a Communist?" Before he finished speaking, he quickly slipped out.

    When he got home and looked in the west wing, Lao Hu hadn't returned yet. Carpenter Wang's heart was pounding. At this moment, Ma Jin poked his head in. He asked, "Is Lao Hu home?" Carpenter Wang said, "He's not here. Do you need to find him?" Ma Jin turned and left.

    As soon as it got dark, Lao Hu returned with his pancake cart. As soon as he put down the cart, Carpenter Wang approached him and whispered, "The situation outside is bad. They say they want to arrest you. You should leave quickly."

    Lao Hu smiled and said, "It's okay."

    The oil lamp was lit. Lao Hu, as usual, taught Deshan to read. They had just read, "There are root vegetables, there are wild vegetables," when they heard someone pounding on the door.

    "Is Lao Hu home?" It was the voice of Wang the patrolman. Carpenter Wang quickly lowered his voice and said, "Jump over the wall and run! It's the police!" Lao Hu said, "If I run, it will implicate your whole family..." Before he finished speaking, the police had already entered.

    Soon after, people said that Lao Hu was sent to Hankou and was later killed.

    Later, everyone slowly learned that Lao Hu was originally a college student from Beijing, a true Communist.

    一个“卖烧饼的人”
    ——长辛店一个老工人讲的故事
    刘群
    王木匠的家，住在玉皇庄，离长辛店铁路工厂二里多地。一天，王木匠路过潘家烧饼铺，潘掌柜的给他介绍一个青年人说：“这是老胡，人很好，就是穷！”王木匠一看这人，中等身材，穿的破衣烂衫，白脸膛，两个人一谈就很投机。老胡说：“我住在镇外，离长辛店工厂太远，做小买卖不方便，王师傅你帮助找个住处怎么样？地方越清静越好……”王木匠是个热心肠人，又见这人不错，就答应说：“就搬到我家西下屋去住吧，我那里，要说清静是没比的，周围都是坟地，离厂子也近。”
    搬家这天，王木匠一看，老胡什么也没有，只有一床像油炸似的破被子，就给他借一张铺板，买一袋面；又找了张破桌子，这样，老胡总算能起火做饭了。
    这个青年人，也真怪，白天卖烧饼，晚上回来还看书、写字，总不休息。晚上有时候跟同院的工人闲谈，一谈就是半宿。同院的工人谁都和他谈得来。工人们也吃惊：这个老胡，满口南方话，看样子是打外地来的，怎么对长辛店工人的生活这样熟悉呐？那时候，正是“二七”惨案以后不几年，长辛店铁路工人正过着苦日子，就像后来有人编的歌一样：
    平汉路变成贫寒路，
    失业的工人沦落在街头，
    琉璃河变成了流泪河呵，
    眼泪比河水还要多！
    长辛店变成了伤心店，
    伤心的事儿说不完。
    工人那个能穿暖？
    一来二去，卖烧饼的老胡跟工人们全混熟了。那时候，江西红军闹革命正闹得火红，传说很多。一天，王木匠问老胡说：“听说南边闹得很利害……。”“不要怕，”老胡说：“南边的咱们人过来就好了。”老胡卖烧饼忙了一天，连吃都混不上，没吃的就在王木匠家吃。冬天，外面下着烟雪，老胡没有棉衣裳，王木匠就把自己的棉裤脱下来给老胡穿，想法帮他做棉衣裳。老胡呢，每天晚上也抽空教王木匠儿子德山念书。
    有一回，“铁路工养成所”招收工人，老胡报名去考了。王木匠给当介绍人。老胡真不像个卖烧饼的，一考就考上了第一名。可是，长辛店铁路工厂管人事的说：“不能录用他。”
    不录用老胡是有原因的，长辛店铁路工厂当时的国民党工联会，早就注意上这个奇怪的“卖烧饼的人”了。
    一天早晨，王木匠到国民党工联会主任徐富家里修理桌椅板凳。正好徐富不在家，他的听差的见了王木匠说：“王师傅，你可得加小心，徐富、马进这些人是专抄共产党的，说不定给谁乱带帽子。”
    王木匠一听，心里马上闪过老胡的影子。活还没干完，徐富就回来了。见了王木匠，他笑嘻嘻的说：“王木匠，这回该你发财了。”王木匠一惊：“我在铁路工厂耍一辈子斧头了，还没发财呢。”徐富走近来说：“你知道住在你们家里那个卖烧饼的，是干什么的？他是共产党！你要是抓住他的证据，检举他，一定有你的好处。”
    王木匠心里一沉，但是还不露神色地说：“他是个穷卖烧饼的，怎么是共产党呢？”话没说完，他就赶紧溜了出来。
    回家一看西屋，老胡还没回来，王木匠心里突突跳。这时候，马进一探头进来了。他问：“老胡在家吗？”王木匠说：“不在家，你找他有事吗？”马进转身就走了。
    天刚黑，老胡担着烧饼挑子回来了。担子一放，王木匠就凑近他，小声地说：“外面风声不好，说要抓你，你快走吧。”
    老胡笑笑，说：“不要紧。”
    油灯点起来了。老胡和往常一样，教德山念书。刚念到：“有根菜，有野菜”就听外面有人砸门。
    “老胡在家吗？”这是王巡警的声音。王木匠忙压住嗓子说：“快跳墙跑吧，是警察！”老胡说：“我跑会连累你们全家的……”还没说完，警察已经进来了。
    不久，人们就传说，老胡被送到汉口，随着就被杀害了。
    后来，大家慢慢才知道，老胡原来是从北京来的大学生，真是一个共产党员。
