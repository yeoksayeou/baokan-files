Xinhua News Agency, July 13th, Paris dispatch: French Foreign Minister Bidault, while discussing the North African situation in the National Assembly on July 12th, reiterated that French troops are not prepared to withdraw from Tunisia, nor are they prepared to give up freedom of action in Morocco.

Bidault said that negotiations regarding the mutual relations between France and Tunisia have encountered serious difficulties because the Tunisian Prime Minister issued a statement demanding the withdrawal of French troops. He stated that the French government cannot accept this statement. "France cannot agree to withdraw French forces from Bizerte (Tunisia), which is an important factor in the defense of the Mediterranean."

When discussing France's relationship with Morocco, Bidault said that Franco-Moroccan negotiations are continuing. He expressed hope for a quick resolution to the issue of Franco-Moroccan military cooperation. At the same time, he stated that French troops cannot lose their freedom of action in Morocco, because it is necessary to "defend" Algeria.

    比诺公开扬言
    法军要继续留在突摩两国
    据新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺七月十二日在国民议会讨论北非局势的时候重申，法军不准备撤出突尼斯，也不准备放弃在摩洛哥的行动自由。
    比诺说，关于法国和突尼斯相互关系的谈判已经遭遇严重困难，因为突尼斯首相发表了要求法军撤离的声明。他表示，法国政府不能接受这个声明。“法国不能同意把法国部队撤出作为地中海防御重要因素的比塞大（突尼斯）”。
    比诺在谈到法国同摩洛哥的关系的时候说，法摩谈判正在继续进行。他表示希望赶快解决法摩军事合作问题。同时他表示，法国军队不能丧失在摩洛哥的行动自由，因为需要“保卫”阿尔及利亚。
