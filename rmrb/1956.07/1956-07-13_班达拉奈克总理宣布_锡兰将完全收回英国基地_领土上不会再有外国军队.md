Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 12th: Colombo dispatch: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike reported to the House of Representatives yesterday on the agreement he reached with the British government in London regarding the British handover of its military bases in Ceylon. He emphasized the explanation of the point in the agreement that Britain would continue to enjoy "certain facilities" in Ceylon.

Bandaranaike said that no matter what agreement was reached on the issue of facilities, these facilities "will depend on such an overriding position, that is: we, and only we, are the people who control these bases."

Bandaranaike told the House of Representatives that the manner of granting facilities would not impair Ceylon's basic attitude towards the bases. He said, "I don't think that when dealing with friendly countries, we should refuse to grant certain facilities under suitable control conditions, such as storing gasoline or ammunition depots."

He also said that after the Ceylon government takes over the bases, it will use them in the way it deems best. "We have not promised to maintain Trincomalee and Katunayake as military bases. They may also be used for commercial purposes."

Earlier that day, Bandaranaike said at a press conference that the understanding he reached with the British government on the military base issue would never hinder Ceylon's independent actions. When the details of the handover and the withdrawal of British troops from the base are completed, the flag of Ceylon will fly over the base, and finally, except for those who may be serving in Ceylon or making goodwill visits, there will be no more foreign troops on Ceylon's territory.

He said: "After Ceylon takes over Trincomalee, it will no longer be the headquarters of the British East Indies Fleet."

The issue of allowing Britain to enjoy certain facilities after handing over the base to Ceylon has aroused strong criticism in Ceylon public opinion. According to news reports, the left wing of the People's United Front parliamentary group of the ruling party, headed by Samuel Dias Bandaranaike (the Prime Minister's relative), believes that the British base in Ceylon is a threat to Asia. They believe that Ceylon should recover these bases, at least when it becomes a republic.

### 班达拉奈克总理宣布  锡兰将完全收回英国基地  领土上不会再有外国军队

    班达拉奈克总理宣布
    锡兰将完全收回英国基地
    领土上不会再有外国军队
    新华社新德里12日电　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克昨天在众议院报告了他在伦敦同英国政府就英国移交它在锡兰的军事基地问题达成的协议。他着重解释了协议中关于英国将继续在锡兰享有“某些便利”这一点。
    班达拉奈克说，不论在关于便利问题上取得了什么协议，这种便利“都将取决于这样一种超越一切的立场，那就是：我们，也只有我们才是控制这些基地的人”。
    班达拉奈克对众议院说，给予便利的方式将不致有损锡兰对于基地的基本态度。他说，我不认为在同友好国家打交道的时候，应该拒绝在合适控制条件之下给予某种便利，譬如储存汽油或者弹药库。
    他还说，锡兰政府在接收基地以后，将根据它认为是最好的办法来使用它。我们并没有答应一定要把亭可马里和卡图那雅克继续维持为军事基地，可能它们也将供商用。
    当天较早的时候，班达拉奈克曾经在记者招待会上说，他同英国政府就军事基地问题达成的谅解绝不会妨碍锡兰的独立行动。当关于移交的细节和英军从基地撤退完成以后，锡兰的国旗就将在基地上空飘扬，并且最后，除了那些可能在锡兰供职的人或者进行亲善访问的人以外，在锡兰领土上将不会再有外国军队。
    他说：锡兰接收亭可马里以后，它就再也不成其为英国在东印度群岛舰队的总部了。
    关于允许英国在把基地移交给锡兰以后还享有某些便利的问题在锡兰舆论中引起了强烈的批评。消息报道，以塞缪尔·迪亚斯·班达拉奈克（总理的亲戚）为首的政府党人民联合阵线议会党团的左派认为，英国在锡兰的基地是对亚洲的一个威胁，他们认为锡兰应当收回这些基地，至少在它成为一个共和国的时候。
