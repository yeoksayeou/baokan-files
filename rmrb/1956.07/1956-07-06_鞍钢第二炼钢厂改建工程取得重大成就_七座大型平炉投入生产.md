Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 5th. The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant, which began reconstruction in November 1954, has already put seven automated large open-hearth furnaces into production. The remaining few open-hearth furnaces under construction are expected to be put into production within this year.

This is a steel plant that suffered severe damage before liberation and was shut down for more than ten years. The original design and equipment were very backward. The reconstruction has absorbed the latest technical achievements in steelmaking around the world, fundamentally changing the backward situation. Due to its advanced design and superior equipment, the annual steelmaking time after the reconstruction can be increased by about 15% compared to the old steel plant, and each open-hearth furnace can produce more than one hundred more heats of steel per year than each open-hearth furnace in the old steel plant. The annual production value of each worker in the whole plant can exceed more than twice that of the old steel plant on average.

The construction project of this giant steel plant was very arduous. However, the employees of dozens of engineering teams from eight construction and installation engineering companies, including steelmaking, machinery, electrical, metal structure, industrial furnace construction, industrial pipeline, external water supply and drainage, and railway, who participated in the reconstruction project, displayed high construction enthusiasm and wisdom, and overcame various difficulties in the construction. In order to ensure that Anshan Iron and Steel reaches the 1957 production level in 1956 and supports construction throughout the country, since November 1955, they have delivered a completed open-hearth furnace to the steelworkers on average every month, and will soon be able to complete the entire construction task. The construction of this factory has also received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union.

The steelworkers have quickly learned the new technology of operating the new large open-hearth furnaces. In the first month after each open-hearth furnace was put into production, it broke through the steelmaking time specified in the design. In the first five months of this year, there were 454 heats of fast steelmaking.

    鞍钢第二炼钢厂改建工程取得重大成就
    七座大型平炉投入生产
    据新华社鞍山5日电　从1954年11月起动工改建的鞍钢第二炼钢厂，已经有七座自动化大型平炉投入生产。正在建设中的最后的几座平炉，也可以在今年内投入生产。
    这是一座解放前遭受严重破坏而停产了十多年的炼钢厂，原来的设计和设备都很落后；改建中吸收了世界炼钢方面的最新的技术成就，根本改变了落后状况。由于设计先进、设备优越，它在改建后，每年的炼钢时间可以比旧炼钢厂增加15％左右，每座平炉每年可以比旧炼钢厂的每座平炉多炼出一百多炉的钢。全厂每个工人一年的生产价值平均可以超过旧炼钢厂两倍以上。
    这座巨型炼钢厂的建设工程十分艰巨。但是参加改建工程施工的炼钢、机械、电气、金属结构、工业筑炉、工业管道、厂外上下水道、铁路等八个建筑安装工程公司的几十个工程队的职工们，发挥了高度的建设热情和智慧，克服了建设中的各种困难。他们为了保证鞍钢在1956年就达到1957年的生产水平，支援全国各地的建设，从1955年11月份以来，平均每个月里都交给炼钢工人们一座建设好的平炉，并且不久就可以全部完成建设任务。这座工厂的建设还得到了苏联的无私援助。
    炼钢工人都很快学会了操纵新式大型平炉的新技术。每座平炉在投入生产后的第一个月里，就突破了设计规定的炼钢时间。在今年的头五个月里就出现了四百五十四炉快速炼钢。
