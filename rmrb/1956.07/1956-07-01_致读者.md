Starting today, the People's Daily will be expanded to eight pages. At the same time, there will be some changes in the editorial work. We would like to take this opportunity to discuss these changes.

The People's Daily is the newspaper of the Party and also the newspaper of the people. From its inception to the present, it has served the interests of the Party and the people. Precisely because of this, the People's Daily has received heart-warming support from its readers and has made progress year by year in its work for more than eight years since its founding. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work. Recently, we will focus on improving our work in the following three aspects.

First, expand the scope of reporting. We live in a world full of changes, and different readers want to understand this changing world from different perspectives. To satisfy the diverse needs of readers as much as possible is our duty. In the past, our space was relatively small and could not accommodate a lot of material, which was a difficulty. The reason why we are expanding the page size in the current situation of insufficient paper supply is precisely to solve this difficulty. But the problem is not just this. We have not worked hard enough to publish more news and news from various aspects within the limited space. Important and new things in life – whether they are in the socialist camp or in capitalist countries, in metropolitan areas or in remote rural areas, directly related to construction or not directly related to construction, pleasant or not pleasant – people hope to see more of them in the newspaper, and we should collect and publish more of them. After the newspaper is expanded to eight pages, the amount of our news will increase by about one and a half times, and the scope of topics will also be expanded as much as possible to meet the needs of readers.

Second, develop free discussion. The newspaper is the mouthpiece of society. In any society, members of society cannot hold the same view on any specific issue. The Party and the people's newspapers have the responsibility to guide social opinions to the correct path, but in order to achieve this goal, simple and forced methods should not be adopted. First of all, the editorial department of the newspaper, no matter what name it uses, should not assume that it is omniscient and omnipotent, or deliberately put on such a pretentious air, as if it can make absolutely correct conclusions on any issue at any time. No, the fact is definitely not so. Many questions need to be gradually answered in mass discussions. Some questions may not even be able to get a definite answer temporarily after a period of discussion. Many questions, although they already have correct answers, should be widely publicized among the masses, but this kind of publicity does not exclude appropriate and beneficial discussions. On the contrary, this kind of discussion can better help people understand the correctness of the answers. Moreover, even the correct answers often need to be supplemented and revised in the practice of the masses. Although we do not advocate endless discussions, and the space of the newspaper does not allow us to discuss any issue, in any case, people who are afraid of discussion are always ridiculous. In the past, our newspaper has not done well in developing discussions, which has also reduced the vitality of the newspaper. We hope to strive for improvement in the future. In order to facilitate free discussion, we hope that readers will note that although the articles published in our newspaper have been selected by the editorial department, they do not necessarily represent the views of the editorial department. This is not to say that the views representing the editorial department cannot be discussed, but rather that the views of some articles we publish are somewhat different from those of the editorial department, and the views of the authors of these articles also differ from each other. We hope that readers will consider this situation to be normal. This situation not only does not hinder but also helps the solution of problems, whether the problem is solved because one view triumphs over other views, or because different views approach each other in the debate. The facts published in our newspaper are all strived to be verified by the editorial department through investigation, but sometimes certain issues (especially those raised in readers' letters) are not easy to quickly find out in individual details, but it is necessary to publish them in a timely manner in order to seek a quick solution. In that case, the editorial department will also publish them and let some details be clarified in the process of seeking truth from facts. This is also what we hope everyone will understand.

Third, improve the writing style. The newspaper is published every day, and it uses tens of thousands of words every day to influence millions of readers. Therefore, the writing in the newspaper should strive to be informative, reasonable, and well-organized. The ancients said it well: "If words are not polished, they will not travel far." In fact, a bad writing style not only makes readers unwilling to read, but also creates a harmful atmosphere, which is detrimental to ideology and culture, as well as politics and economy. In the past, although our newspaper has published many good articles and the writing in the newspaper has gradually improved, on the whole, stiff, dry, and lengthy works are still numerous, and empty, dogmatic Party jargon and incomprehensible phenomena have not disappeared. We hope to strive to change this situation. In addition to the editorial department's own efforts, we ask authors to pay attention to the voices of the majority of readers when giving us manuscripts, and try to write articles in a coherent, interesting, and lively manner, full of emotion, and never let readers feel drowsy. Newspapers are read by millions of people, and the vast majority of them have little time to read long articles. Therefore, with very few exceptions, the articles in newspapers are always as short as possible. We especially hope that authors can cooperate with us on this point.

After the newspaper is expanded to eight pages, the layout is generally arranged as follows: the first page is still for important news, which is not much different from before; the content of the second and third pages is domestic economy, roughly the second page focuses on industry and transportation, and the third page focuses on agriculture and commerce; the content of the fourth page is domestic politics, including the life of the Party, and there is also a column for news from the capital or local communications; the fifth and sixth pages are international pages; the seventh page is the academic and cultural page; the upper half of the eighth page is a literary supplement, and the lower half is advertisements. The original reader's letter page has been cancelled, and reader's letters will be published on various pages. Of course, it is difficult for the layout of the newspaper to remain unchanged (for example, today's newspaper's second and third pages both published documents from the National People's Congress meeting). We are now simply introducing it in order to give readers a general idea.

Our newspaper is called "People's Daily," which means that it is the people's public weapon and public property. The people are its masters. Only by relying on the people can we run the newspaper well. When we were studying the improvement of editorial work, many readers gave us valuable opinions and gave us great help. However, the improvement of the newspaper is a long-term task, and the requirements we have put forward here are not easy to fully realize immediately. We look forward to the vast number of readers across the country giving us more help, more criticism and instructions!

专栏：社论

    致读者
    人民日报从今天起改出八个版。同时，在编辑工作上也有一些改变。我们愿意利用这个机会把这些改变谈一谈。
    人民日报是党的报纸，也是人民的报纸，从它创刊到现在，一直是为党和人民的利益服务的。正因为这样，人民日报在创刊八年多以来，备受广大读者的令人心感的支持，工作也逐年得到进步。但是我们工作中仍然有很多缺点。在最近，我们将着重从以下三方面改进我们的工作。
    第一，扩大报道范围。我们是生活在一个充满着变化的世界，各种不同的读者要求从不同的方面了解这个变化着的世界。尽量满足读者的多方面的要求，这是我们的天职。在过去，我们的篇幅比较小，不能容纳很多材料，这是一个困难。我们所以在目前纸张供不应求的情况下扩大篇幅，正是为了解决这个困难。但是问题并不尽在于此。我们没有努力在有限的篇幅中多发新闻，发多方面的新闻。生活里的重要的、新的事物——无论是社会主义阵营的，或者是资本主义国家的，是通都大邑的，或者是穷乡僻壤的，是直接有关于建设的，或者是并不直接有关于建设的，是令人愉快的，或者是并不令人愉快的，人民希望在报纸上多看到一些，我们也就应该多采集、多登载一些。在报纸改出八个版以后，我们的新闻在数量上将增加一倍半左右，在题材上也将尽量扩大范围，力求适应读者的需要。
    第二，开展自由讨论。报纸是社会的言论机关。在任何一个社会里，社会的成员不可能对于任何一个具体问题都抱有同一种见解。党的和人民的报纸有责任把社会的见解引向正确的道路，但是为了达到这个目的，不应该采取简单的、勉强的方法。首先，报纸的编辑部无论凭着什么名义，总不能设想自己是全知全能的，或者故意摆出这样一副神气，活像对于任何问题可以随时作出绝对正确的结论。不是的，事实决不是如此。有许多问题需要在群众性的讨论中逐渐得到答案。有一部分问题甚至在一个时期的讨论以后暂时也还不能得到确定的答案。有许多问题，虽然已经有了正确的答案，应该在群众中加以广泛的宣传，但是这种宣传也并不排斥适当的有益的讨论。相反，这种讨论可以更好地帮助人们认识答案的正确性。而且就是正确的答案，也经常需要在群众的实践中加以补充和修正。我们虽然不提倡无休止的讨论，报纸的篇幅也不允许对于任何问题都去讨论，但是无论如何，害怕讨论的人总是可笑的人。在开展讨论方面，过去我们的报纸是作得很不好的，因而也减少了报纸的生气。今后我们希望力求改进。为了便于开展自由讨论，我们希望读者注意：在我们的报纸上发表的文章，虽然是经过编辑部选择的，但是并不一定都代表编辑部的意见，——这不是说代表编辑部的意见就不可以讨论，而是说，我们发表的某些文章的某些观点跟编辑部的有所不同，这些文章的作者的观点彼此也不同，这种情形希望读者认为是正常的。这种情形不但不妨碍而且有助于问题的解决，无论问题是由于一种观点战胜了其他的观点而解决，或者是由于不同观点在争论中互相接近而解决。在我们的报纸上发表的事实，编辑部都力求经过调查证实，但是有时某些问题（特别是读者来信中提出的问题）在个别细节上不容易很快地查得一清二楚，却有必要及时地发表出来，以求迅速解决，那末，编辑部也将加以发表，而让它们的某些细节在实事求是的讨论的过程中弄清。这也是希望大家谅解的。
    第三，改进文风。报纸是每天出版的，它每天都要用几万字去影响几百万读者，因此，报纸上的文字应该力求言之有物，言之成理，而且言之成章。古人说得好：言之无文，行而不远。实际上，文风不好，不但读者不愿意看，而且还会造成有害的风气，不利于思想文化，也不利于政治经济。在过去，我们的报纸上虽然也登过不少好文章，报纸上的文字虽然也逐渐有些进步，但是整个说来，生硬的、枯燥的、冗长的作品还是很多，空洞的、武断的党八股以及文理不通的现象也远没有绝迹。我们希望努力改变这种状况。除了编辑部自己努力以外，我们请求作者们在给我们稿件的时候，也务必注意到广大读者的呼声，尽量把文章写得有条理，有兴味，议论风生，文情并茂，万不要让读者看了想打瞌睡。报纸是给几百万人看的，他们中间的绝大多数人很难有时间看长文章，因此，除了很少的例外，报纸上的文章总是越短越好。这一点也特别希望作者们能跟我们合作。
    报纸改出八个版以后，版面一般地是作这样的安排：第一版还是要闻，跟以前没有多大分别；第二、三版的内容是国内经济，大致第二版着重工业和交通，第三版着重农业和商业；第四版的内容是国内政治，包括党的生活，此外还有一栏首都新闻或者地方通讯；第五、六版是国际版；第七版是学术文化版；第八版上半是带文学性的副刊，下半是广告。原来的读者来信专页取消了，读者来信将分别登在各版上。当然，报纸的版面是很难一成不变的（例如今天的报纸第二、三版就都登了全国人民代表大会会议的文件），我们现在简单地介绍一下，只是为着让读者心中有个数罢了。
    我们的报纸名字叫作“人民日报”，意思就是说它是人民的公共的武器，公共的财产。人民群众是它的主人。只有靠着人民群众，我们才能把报纸办好。在我们研究编辑工作的改进的时候，很多读者曾经给我们提出宝贵的意见，给了我们很大帮助。但是报纸的改进是一个长时期的工作，我们在这里提出的几项要求也不容易马上完全实现，我们期待全国广大的读者给我们更多的帮助，更多的批评和指示！
