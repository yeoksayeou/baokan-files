Product Quality Review

    Which brands of flashlights are good? Which brands of flashlights are bad?
    The White Elephant brand flashlight produced by Shanghai Tongming Flashlight Factory, the Guanghua brand flashlight produced by Shanghai Jingsheng Flashlight Factory, and the Da Wu Wei (Daredevil) brand flashlight produced by Shanghai China Huiming Factory are all flashlights of relatively good quality. Their common advantages are: they can focus light, the light is strong, the switch is easy to use, the front and rear screws fit well, and the body of the flashlight does not turn yellow or peel. The White Elephant brand flashlight is especially popular among consumers. The flashlight head has a movable device; by turning the head to one side and placing the flashlight upright on a table, the white light of the flashlight will illuminate the table for studying or working, like a desk lamp. This type of flashlight can also be strung with a rope for easy carrying, making it very suitable for farmers, field exploration personnel, and the military.
    The Cat Head brand flashlight previously produced by Guangzhou Dongzhou Flashlight Factory was of the worst quality. The switch was unresponsive, sometimes requiring shaking to turn it on, and sometimes it would inexplicably turn on automatically, so consumers gave it two nicknames: "Shaking Flashlight" and "Automatic Flashlight." This type of flashlight is still available on the market. However, since this year, the quality of the Cat Head brand flashlight has greatly improved: it can focus light, the switch is flexible, and the front and rear screws have also been lengthened for a better fit. The chromium plating on the body is twice as thick as before, glossy and not easily rusted. The cost has even been reduced compared to before.
    The Sunlight brand flashlight from Chongqing 791 Factory, the Flying Elephant brand flashlight from Tianjin China Flashlight Factory, and the Sun and Moon brand flashlight from Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory are all of poor quality. Their common shortcomings are: some flashlights cannot focus light and are not bright; some switches are not flexible, being difficult to turn on when needed but turning on automatically when not in use; some flashlights have loose front and rear screws that cannot be tightened; and the body has spots, is uneven, and is prone to rusting and cracking.　　(Ding Ningzhen)

### 什么牌子的电筒好？什么牌子的电筒不好？

    什么牌子的电筒好？什么牌子的电筒不好？
    上海通明电筒厂出品的白象牌手电筒，上海竞生电筒厂出品的光华牌手电筒和上海中国汇明厂出品的大无畏牌手电筒，都是质量比较好的电筒。它们共同的优点是：能聚光，光线强，开关好用，前后的螺丝很合适，筒身不会发黄和掉皮。白象牌手电筒尤其受消费者欢迎。这种电筒的筒头有活动装置，把筒头转向一侧，再把电筒直立放在桌上，手电的白光就会照亮桌子，供人学习或工作用，如同一盏台灯。这种电筒还可以穿上绳子，携带方便，很适合农民、野外钻探人员和部队使用。
    广州东洲电筒厂以前生产的猫头牌电筒，质量最坏，开关不灵，有时候需要摇一摇才亮，有时候却莫名其妙地自动亮起来，所以消费者给它起两个外号，叫“摇头电筒”“自动化电筒”。这种电筒现在市场上还有得卖。但是，今年以来，猫头牌电筒质量大为提高：能聚光，开关灵活，前后的螺丝也加长了，合适了。筒身镀的克罗米比过去厚一倍，光泽而不易生锈。成本却比以前减低了一些。
    重庆七九一厂的日光牌手电筒，天津中国电筒厂的飞象牌电筒，重庆电工器材厂的日月牌手电筒，质量都不大好。它们共同的缺点是：部分电筒不能聚光，不亮；部分开关不灵活，要用的时候开不动，不用的时候却又自动地亮起来；部分电筒前后的螺丝松滑，盖不上去；筒身有斑点、凹凸不平，容易生锈、破裂。　　（丁宁真）
