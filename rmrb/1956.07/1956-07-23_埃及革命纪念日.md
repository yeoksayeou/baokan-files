Egyptian Revolution Memorial Day

    Before the revolution, Egypt was a country under monarchical autocracy. Farouk, the last king of the Egyptian feudal dynasty, was obsequious to foreign powers, allowing imperialism to ravage Egypt's national interests. Domestically, he levied exorbitant taxes and lived a life of extravagance and dissipation, while the vast majority of Egyptian working people lived a miserable life of humiliation, powerlessness, and enslavement.

    July 23, 1952, marked a new page in Egyptian history. On this day, Egypt completed a swift revolutionary coup. This coup was launched by a secret organization called the "Free Officers Movement" led by Nasser. At the time, this organization put forward the following appeals: oppose the courtiers and corrupt politicians in the palace, oppose corruption in the government and the army, oppose foreign rule and occupation, and oppose the feudal system. These appeals embodied the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal aspirations and were supported by the broad masses of the Egyptian people. Therefore, when the coup was launched on July 23, Farouk's Royal Guard also participated. The Revolutionary Command Council, composed of the "Free Officers Movement," quickly seized state power.

    The Revolutionary Command Council decided to expel Farouk from the country for life. On July 26, Farouk left Egypt forever.

    After seizing power, the Revolutionary Command Council adopted a series of revolutionary measures, confiscating a large amount of land occupied by the king and the palace clique, abolishing social classes and aristocratic titles, and purging the old state apparatus. Soon after, the Revolutionary Command Council announced the birth of the Egyptian Republic.

    After Egypt became a republic, the Revolutionary Command Council was responsible for carrying out state affairs. This June, Egypt passed a new constitution and elected a president, thus marking the end of the duties performed by the Revolutionary Command Council. (Hou)

    埃及革命纪念日
    埃及在革命以前是个君主专制的国家。埃及封建皇朝最后的一个国王法鲁克对外卑躬屈节，任凭帝国主义蹂躏埃及的民族利益，对内横征暴敛，过着穷奢极欲的生活，而广大的埃及劳动人民却过着屈辱、无权和被奴役的悲惨生活。
    1952年7月23日，在埃及历史上开始了新的一页。这一天，埃及完成了迅速的革命政变。这个政变是由以纳赛尔为首的“自由军官团”的秘密组织发动的。当时这个组织提出了如下的号召：反对宫中的宠臣和贪污的政客，反对政府和军队中的腐化现象，反对外国的统治和占领，反对封建制度等。这些号召体现了埃及人民反帝反封建的意愿，得到了广大埃及人民的支持。因此，当七月二十三日政变发动的时候，法鲁克国王的卫戍部队也参加了。由“自由军官团”所组成的革命指导委员会很快就掌握了国家的政权。
    革命指导委员会决定把法鲁克终身驱逐出境。七月二十六日，法鲁克便永远离开了埃及。
    革命指导委员会掌握政权后，采取了一系列的革命措施，没收了国王和宫庭集团所占有的大量土地，取消了社会等级和贵族的称号，清洗了旧有的国家机构。此后，革命指导委员会很快地就宣布了埃及共和国的诞生。
    埃及成为共和国后，革命指导委员会即负责执行国家的事务。今年六月，埃及通过了新宪法，选举了总统，革命指导委员会所履行的职责也就宣告结束。（厚）
