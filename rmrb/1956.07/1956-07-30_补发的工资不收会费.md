    In accordance with the State Council's regulations on wage reform, supplemental wages will be issued starting from April 1st this year. In order to save state expenditure and to take care of the livelihood of members, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided:
    (1) Union members will not pay supplemental union fees for the wages retroactively paid from April 1st. Starting in August, members will pay union fees according to the new wage amount.
    (2) Government agencies, schools, state-owned, jointly state-private, and cooperative enterprises will also be exempt from paying labor insurance funds and trade union funds that should be allocated from the wages retroactively paid from April 1st.
    (3) If, before receiving this notice, some grassroots trade union organizations' members have already paid supplemental union fees, and administrative enterprises have already allocated labor insurance funds and trade union funds, they can deduct or refund these amounts in the next payment. It is hoped that this decision will be implemented accordingly.

    补发的工资不收会费
    新华社讯　中华全国总工会二十七日向所属各级工会组织发出“关于补发四至七月份提高工资部分，会员不交会费、行政方面不拨经费的通知”，全文如下：
    按照国务院关于工资改革的规定，从今年四月一日起补发工资。为了节省国家开支，为了照顾会员的生活，全总决定：
      （一）自四月一日起补发给职工的工资，工会会员不补交会费。从八月份起，会员按照新的工资额交纳会费。
      （二）机关，学校，国营、公私合营和合作社营等企业单位，自四月一日起补发的工资应拨交的劳动保险金和工会经费也免予交纳。
      （三）如在接到通知前，一些工会基层组织的会员已经补交会费，行政企业单位已经补拨交劳动保险金和工会经费，可以在下次交纳时扣除或退还。希按照此决定执行。
