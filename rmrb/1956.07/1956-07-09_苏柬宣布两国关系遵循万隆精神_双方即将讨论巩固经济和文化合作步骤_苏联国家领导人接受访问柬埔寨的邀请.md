During the talks, the representatives of both sides exchanged candid and beneficial opinions on issues concerning relations between the Soviet Union and Cambodia, as well as on certain general international issues of concern to both countries, and unanimously agreed that such talks would contribute to the interests of the people of both countries and the cause of world peace.

The joint communique pointed out that the representatives of the two countries considered ways to strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and Cambodia. They discussed the forms of such cooperation between the two countries and agreed on the general principles based on selfless friendship and mutual assistance. Soviet and Cambodian experts will soon meet in Cambodia to study practical ways to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries. The experts will especially consider the issue of assisting the Kingdom of Cambodia in the construction of industrial and other enterprises, as well as in the training of technical personnel.

The Soviet government expressed its willingness to provide Cambodia with technical and economic assistance without attaching any selfish conditions, and with full respect for Cambodia's autonomy, independence, and national dignity, so that Cambodia can develop its economy, continue to maintain its neutral policy, and maintain friendly cooperation with other countries, which will be conducive to Cambodia's prosperity and happiness and to strengthening peace.

The Cambodian representatives expressed their admiration for the Soviet Union's peaceful and friendly policy towards all countries, and their admiration for its continued support for economically underdeveloped countries.

The Soviet representatives attached great importance to the Kingdom of Cambodia's firm and courageous spirit and gave it due consideration. The Kingdom of Cambodia, with this spirit, achieved its independence and is now maintaining its independence with this spirit, pursuing a neutral policy that contributes to consolidating the cause of peace.

During the talks, both sides took note of the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Cambodia and the important role these agreements play in strengthening peace in Indochina and creating preconditions for the peaceful settlement of unresolved disputes in this region of the world, as well as the value and importance of steadfastly implementing the provisions of these agreements.

The Soviet government has expressed its willingness to build and equip a hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, as a gift from the Soviet people to the government and people of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The representatives of the Kingdom of Cambodia gratefully accepted this gift from the Soviet government.

The joint communique stated that during the talks, Sihanouk conveyed to Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin, Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Member Khrushchev, and Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov invitations from the King and people of Cambodia to visit the Kingdom of Cambodia as state guests. This invitation has been gladly accepted. The timing of the visit will be agreed upon by both parties at a later date.
