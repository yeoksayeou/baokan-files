Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 24th: On July 23rd, Harold Stassen, Special Assistant to the President on Disarmament and a Republican, announced that he would launch a campaign to support Massachusetts Governor Christian Herter as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, rather than current Vice President Nixon as Eisenhower's running mate. Stassen called on all Republican organizations and representatives to support this movement.

At a press conference announcing this decision, Stassen stated that his suggestion was made in consideration of domestic and international factors. He said that as the presidential election approaches, the negative aspects of the Eisenhower-Nixon combination will increase. He implied that, given Nixon's unpopularity, Eisenhower should not be burdened with such an "obstacle that could be gracefully avoided" in this election. Stassen said that an Eisenhower-Herter ticket would garner at least 6% more votes than an Eisenhower-Nixon ticket, which could play a "decisive role" in some close congressional races.

Stassen's statement caused confusion within the Republican Party, and many observers believe his statement was like a bomb to the Republican Party.

Reuters reported that Stassen's actions "risk splitting the Republican Party." Reuters predicted that at the Republican nomination convention in San Francisco next month, the historic struggle between the party's "conservatives" (referring to the political forces representing Western and Midwestern financial groups) and "internationalists" (referring to the political forces representing Eastern big financial groups) may occur again. Reuters reported that Stassen's anti-Nixon campaign appears very likely to fuel infighting between these two factions within the Republican Party.

    美国大选前夕共和党内部倾轧
    史塔生反对尼克松当副总统候选人
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统的裁军问题特别顾问、共和党人史塔生七月二十三日宣布他将发起一个运动，支持马萨诸塞州州长克里斯钦·赫脱为共和党副总统候选人，而不要现任副总统尼克松充当艾森豪威尔的竞选副手。史塔生要求所有共和党组织和代表支持这个运动。
    史塔生在宣布这个决定的记者招待会上表示，他的这个建议是考虑到国内外因素而提出的。他说，随着总统选举的逼近，艾森豪威尔—尼克松组合的消极方面将会增加。他暗示，鉴于尼克松的不得人心，在这次选举中不应当给艾森豪威尔加上像尼克松这样一个本来“可以体面地避免的障碍”。史塔生说，艾森豪威尔—赫脱的联合名单比艾森豪威尔—尼克松的联合名单至少会多得6％的选票，而这在一些势均力敌的国会竞争中能够起“决定性的作用”。
    史塔生的声明在共和党内部引起了混乱，许多观察家认为他的声明对共和党说来，等于是一颗炸弹。
    路透社消息指出，史塔生的行动“有使共和党分裂的危险”。路透社预料，在下月举行的旧金山共和党提名会议上，党内“保守派”
  （指代表西部和中西部财团的政治势力）和“国际派”（指代表东部大财团的政治势力）之间的历史性斗争，可能再度发生。路透社消息说，史塔生发起反尼克松的运动，看来十之八九会促成共和党内这两派的倾轧。
