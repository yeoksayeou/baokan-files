In the plan formulated by the Municipal Vegetable Company, the following figures can be seen: in 1956, to ensure that the city's average person can eat nine taels of vegetables per day, and according to the different seasons, respectively determine the spring to be six taels and five qian, summer to be one jin and two taels, autumn to be one jin and seven taels, and winter to be seven taels and five qian. In addition, the company has also decided to strive to increase the variety of vegetables, to achieve fresh vegetables in all seasons, and to always maintain the supply of twenty-five to thirty kinds of vegetables throughout the year. The catering supply, which is closely related to the lives of the people of the city, will also be further improved. Factories, government offices, enterprises and other units will take measures from various aspects to improve the management of their canteens so that the majority of employees will be satisfied. In addition to the 104 breakfast stalls already established in the city, the Municipal Catering Company has tentatively decided to add 60 small food stalls near factories, enterprises, government offices, schools and other units, and add four restaurants in the industrial area and the Jiangbei scenic area. A comprehensive adjustment will be made to public restaurants throughout the city. In addition, the supply points for coarse grains will also be restored, and the prices of meals will be adjusted reasonably. For employees whose residences are far from their workplaces, adjustments will also be made gradually to bring residences closer to workplaces, in order to facilitate work and study, ensure people's rest time, and reduce transportation expenses. The exchange methods will be systematic adjustments, exchanges between units, and voluntary exchanges between individuals. Regarding the difficulty of lacking housing, relevant parties will also take active measures to build new employee housing in a planned manner. According to preliminary calculations, by the end of 1956, about 70% of the population in the urban area will have access to tap water. In the second half of 1956, fifty street nurseries will be established in the city's seven districts, accommodating one thousand five hundred children. In order to solve the difficulty for female employees in picking up and dropping off children, the Municipal Automobile Company has decided to set up mother-child buses in Daoli, Dongfujia, Xifujia, Xiangfang, Guxiang and other districts, dedicated to picking up and dropping off children for female employees. Some service industries will also add necessary equipment in line with the principle of facilitating citizens. In the second half of 1956, the city will add three bathhouses and restore six larger hotels. The bathhouse industry has decided to add disinfection equipment and soap starting in July; "laundry departments" will be set up in key bathhouses to wash clothes for customers.

    The various plans also stipulate measures to reduce the burden on the people's lives. Rents have already been reduced by an average of 45%, and water and sewage fees, sanitation fees, and other expenses will also be gradually reduced.

    哈尔滨市拟订改进人民生活方案
    本报讯　哈尔滨市各有关单位在市人民委员会的直接领导下，正在积极地研究进一步改善人民生活的各项措施。
    从很多单位初步制定出的方案（草案）上可以看出，哈尔滨市人民的生活今后将得到进一步的改善。有很多方案是鼓舞人心的。在市蔬菜公司拟订的方案上，可以看到这样的数字：在1956年内，要保证全市每人每日平均能吃到九两蔬菜，并根据季节的不同，分别确定春季为六两五钱，夏季为一斤二两，秋季为一斤七两，冬季为七两五钱。另外，该公司并决定要努力做到增加蔬菜品种，做到四季有鲜菜，全年要经常保持供应二十五到三十种蔬菜。和全市人民生活关系比较密切的饮食供应工作，也将得到进一步的改进。各工厂、机关、企业等单位，将从多方面采取措施，改进本单位的食堂管理工作，以便使广大职工感到满意。市饮食公司除已在全市设立了104个早点铺，并初步决定在工厂、企业、机关、学校等单位附近增设六十个小食铺，在工业区与江北风景区增设四处饭店，对全市公共饮食店要进行全面的调整。另外，粗食品供应点也要恢复，并合理调整饭菜价格。对职工住宅和工作地点距离远的，也要逐步进行调整，使住宅和工作地点靠近，以便于工作和学习，保证人们的休息时间，减少交通费的开支。调换方法将是系统调整、单位之间调换和个人之间自愿互换。对缺少住宅的困难，有关方面也将采取积极措施，有步骤的新建职工住宅。据初步计算，到1956年年末，占市区70％左右的人口都可用到自来水。在1956年的下半年内，要在全市的七个区内，建立五十个街道托儿站，收容一千五百名儿童。为了解决女职工接送儿童的困难，市汽车公司决定在道里、东傅家、西傅家、香坊、顾乡等区设母子汽车，专供女职工接送儿童之用。一些服务性行业，也都将本着便利市民的方针，增添必要的设备。在1956年的下半年内，全市要增设三个浴池，恢复六处较大型的旅馆。浴池业已决定自七月份开始，增添消毒设备和肥皂；在重点浴池要设置“洗衣部”，为顾客洗濯衣物。
    在各项方案里，也规定了降低人民群众生活负担的措施。房租已经平均降低45％，上下水费、卫生费以及其它方面的费用，也都将逐步降低。
