Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: A major earthquake struck the Greek island of Santorini in the Aegean Sea on July 9th. This earthquake is considered one of the largest in Europe in the 20th century.

    The earthquake's intensity was 8.0, only 0.3 less than the intensity of the historically famous 1906 San Francisco earthquake in the United States. Because a volcano erupted at the same time as the earthquake, the island's capital, Thera, and many towns in the northern part of the island were almost completely reduced to ruins, and other areas also suffered varying degrees of damage.

    According to aerial observations, the volcano on the island had not been extinguished by the 10th, the cliffs facing the sea continued to collapse, and many huge cracks had appeared in the island's land. So far, at least fifty people have died, and hundreds more have been injured.

    The earthquake also caused a tsunami, and areas from Greece to Turkey were hit by large waves.

    On the 10th, two islands eighty miles from Santorini also experienced earthquakes and tsunamis.

    塞拉岛大地震
    据新华社11日讯　在爱琴海中属于希腊的塞拉岛七月九日发生大地震。这次地震被认为是二十世纪以来欧洲最大的地震之一。
    地震的强度是八点零，比历史上有名的1906年美国旧金山大地震的强度只少零点三。由于地震时火山同时爆发，这个岛的首府塞拉市和岛的北端的许多市镇差不多全部变成了废墟，其他地区也遭到了程度不同的损害。
    根据空中观察，岛上的火山到十日还没有熄灭，临海的岩壁继续在崩溃，岛上的土地已经出现了许多巨大的裂缝。总计目前最少已经有五十多人死亡，另外还有成百人受伤。
    地震还引起海啸，从希腊到土耳其一带都遭到大风浪的袭击。
    十日，离塞拉岛八十英里的两个海岛也发生了地震和海啸。
