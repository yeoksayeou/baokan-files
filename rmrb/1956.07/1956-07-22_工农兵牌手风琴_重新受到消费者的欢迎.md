Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin -- The "Worker, Peasant, Soldier" accordion, manufactured by the Tianjin Worker, Peasant, Soldier Musical Instrument Factory, which had been ordered to cease production by the Tianjin Second Light Industry Bureau due to its inferior product quality, has once again become a top-tier product nationwide after quality improvements. Its reeds can vibrate 440 times per second, producing a loud and pleasant sound, and it was exhibited as an excellent product at the National Daily Use Industrial Products Exhibition in Beijing.

In 1952, when the "Worker, Peasant, Soldier" accordion first appeared on the market, it was welcomed by workers, students, and literary and art workers. During this period of high demand, the factory's leadership became complacent and began to produce shoddy goods; the keys would stick, the reeds would rust and become out of tune, and the bellows would leak air. Returns and repairs increased, and the trading departments became unwilling to handle sales.

To change this situation, the Tianjin Second Light Industry Bureau ordered the factory to cease production and conduct a re-trial in February of this year.

After receiving this education, the workers conducted a comprehensive inspection of the accordion's quality. Addressing the key quality problems identified, they organized veteran technicians within the factory to research improvement measures, and jointly manufactured standard samples, which were then formally put into production after being appraised by higher-level leading organs, trade departments, and consumers.

After the quality improved, the "Worker, Peasant, Soldier" accordion regained popularity among consumers. All 3,084 accordions that the factory plans to produce this year have already been ordered by trade departments, government organs, and enterprises from various regions.

    工农兵牌手风琴
    重新受到消费者的欢迎
    据新华社天津讯　因为产品质量低劣，曾经被天津市第二轻工业局下令停产的天津工农兵乐器厂制造的工农兵牌手风琴，改进质量以后，又成了全国第一流的产品。它的声簧每秒钟可以振动四百四十次，声音宏亮动听，在北京全国日用品工业展览会上，作为优秀产品展出了。
    1952年，工农兵牌手风琴在市场上刚一出现，就受到工人、学生和文艺工作者的欢迎。在这个供不应求的时候，工厂的领导人员产生了自满情绪，粗制滥造起来；琴键子按下去起不来，声簧生锈变音，风箱漏气，退货和返修品越来越多，贸易部门也不愿意包销了。
    为了改变这种情况，天津市第二轻工业局在今年二月间下命令要这个厂停止生产，重新试制。
    职工们接受了这个教育以后，对手风琴的质量进行了全面检查。针对检查出来的质量关键问题，组织厂内的老技术工人研究出改进措施，并且共同制造出标准样品，经上级领导机关、贸易部门和消费者鉴定以后，才正式投入生产。
    质量提高以后，工农兵牌手风琴重新受到消费者的欢迎。今年这个工厂计划生产的三千○八十四台手风琴，已经被各地贸易部门、机关企业订购一空。
