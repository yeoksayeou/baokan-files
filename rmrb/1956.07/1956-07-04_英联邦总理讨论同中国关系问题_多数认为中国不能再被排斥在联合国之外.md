Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd, London dispatch: The question of relations with China was the central topic of discussion at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' meeting on the morning of the 2nd.

    According to people attending the meeting, Indian Prime Minister Nehru requested at the meeting that Commonwealth countries cooperate closely with the people of Asian countries. Nehru advocated no longer "improperly delaying" universal recognition of China and advocated admitting China into the United Nations. He believes that as long as China is excluded from the United Nations, there can be no stability in the Far East.

    Pakistani Prime Minister Ali and Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike also requested that Commonwealth countries face up to the "actual realities" of Asia today and believed that the Chinese People's Government had been consolidated and could no longer be excluded from world conferences. When discussing China's entry into the United Nations, the Prime Minister of Ceylon also put forward the idea that there could be "two Chinas" within the United Nations.

    Britain and Canada also believed at the meeting that it was impossible to exclude China from the United Nations for a long time.

    Associated Press reported that the Canadian Prime Minister emphasized at the meeting that American sentiment against China's entry into the United Nations was strong.

    The news said that the meeting, recognizing this point, believed that the issue of admitting China should be dealt with after the US presidential election.

    News has it that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for holding negotiations with the Taiwan authorities on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan was noted by all participants in the meeting. The Prime Ministers of Pakistan and Ceylon both believed that the statement should be accepted at face value. They also advocated that the work of "building bridges" between the Soviet Union and the United States, as mentioned by Eden, should be expanded to include China.

    Reuters reported that a Prime Minister of an Asian country that has diplomatic relations with China said that his country's relations with China were very friendly. He emphasized that it was important to try to improve relations between China and the United States.

    The news said that the Prime Ministers of Asian countries in the Commonwealth all expressed at the meeting that they believed that China today hopes to establish peace with all countries in the world. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said that he agreed with most of the "substance" of this assessment by the Asian Prime Ministers. But he asked for more evidence. New Zealand Prime Minister Holland adopted the same attitude as Menzies.

    Associated Press reported that Eden believed that China's relations with countries in the non-socialist camp have improved.

    Eden said he believed that this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' meeting had "completed half" of the work in building bridges between the West and the socialist camp.

    Reuters said that the meeting also discussed the issue of trade with China. People attending the meeting said that the Prime Minister of a certain Asian country that has diplomatic relations with China advocated expanding trade with China as much as possible.

    According to Reuters, the meeting also briefly discussed the situation in Indochina and the situation in Malaya and Singapore.

    The afternoon meeting on the 2nd discussed internal economic issues within the Commonwealth. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan reported on the trade situation of the Sterling Area with the rest of the world and the gold and dollar reserves of the Commonwealth (excluding Canada). The Federal Prime Ministers also received a report on the progress of the Colombo Plan.

    News said that when studying economic issues, the Prime Ministers also discussed the danger of inflation that is developing in Britain and other Sterling Area countries. They agreed to take action to prevent a new economic crisis that may be coming, and their advisors predicted that the economic crisis may hit the Sterling Area at the end of the year.

    After the morning meeting on the 2nd, Nehru held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd on international issues.
