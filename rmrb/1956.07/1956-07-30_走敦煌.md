    Farewell to Sanmenxia
    Going to Dunhuang

    Villages on Sanmen Mountain,
    Blue smoke rises from the mountain gorges,
    Burning cotton stalks and cooking Laba porridge,
    How many families are near and far?
    Where will you spend the Spring Festival?
    Settle in a new home in Dunhuang;
    White snow on the Qilian Mountains,
    Four thousand *li* of wind and sand.
    In the twelfth month, it is cold and frozen,
    No roadside grass or mountain flowers can be picked,
    The native land is hard to leave,
    But take a handful of yellow earth from the Yellow River's bank.
    Snow water from the Qilian Mountains,
    Can also be used to irrigate cotton...
    Four thousand *li* is not too far,
    Tomorrow, we'll load up and set off.
    Farewell, hometown Yellow River,
    Here, a dam will be built across the river,
    Like steel reins and a bridle,
    Controlling the galloping, fiery horse.
    "Ten years east of the river, ten years west of the river,"
    Is quickly becoming an old saying;
    "Move one family, protect a thousand,"
    Sanmen Village bids farewell to Sanmenxia.

    告别三门峡
    走敦煌    邵燕祥三门山上的村落，青烟飘出山峡，烧棉柴煮腊八饭，远近有多少人家？春节上哪儿去过？到敦煌安个新家；祁连山上白雪，四千里路风沙。腊月里天寒地冻，摘不到路草山花，生身的热土难离，揣上黄河边黄土一把。祁连山上的雪水，引来也好灌棉花……四千里路不算远，明天就装车出发。离别了家乡黄河，这里要拦河修坝，好比是钢缰铁辔，驾驶住奔腾烈马。“十年河东，十年河西”，快成了陈年古话；“搬一家，保千家”，三门村告辞三门峡。
