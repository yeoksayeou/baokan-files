The Positive Results of the South, Egypt, and India Summit

Recently, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Yugoslavia and held political talks with Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito. At a time when people of all countries are striving for further relaxation of the international situation, the summit of the heads of government of South, Egypt, and India has attracted great attention from international public opinion. People believe that this kind of meeting is definitely beneficial to peace. President Tito said it well: "In our era, direct contact and mutual visits between responsible representatives of various countries are becoming an increasingly legitimate and useful method of strengthening understanding and reconciliation between nations, and thus an important factor in realizing mankind's great desire to consolidate world peace."

The joint statement of the South, Egypt, and India summit confirms this. South, Egypt, and India are all countries that actively implement a policy of peace. They adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence, adhere to the principle of national independence, oppose joining confrontational military blocs, advocate extensive economic and cultural cooperation between countries, and establish equal and friendly relations between countries. The consensus expressed by the heads of government of the three countries in the joint statement on current major international issues clearly reflects their common policy. These opinions are in line with the wishes and demands of the people of all countries. This will undoubtedly resonate in the hearts of peace-loving people. It is clear that if a country in a region adheres to a policy of peace, the tension and unrest in that region will be reduced, the threat of war will be weakened, and the guarantee of peace will be enhanced. The positive results of the South, Egypt, and India summit will help expand the influence of the idea of peaceful coexistence and will help further expand the peaceful region of Europe, Asia, and Africa.

The heads of government of South, Egypt, and India are particularly concerned about the situation in the Middle East and North Africa. They believe that the Palestine issue and the Algerian issue must be resolved peacefully on the basis of respect for national rights. They pointed out that colonial rule is harmful to both the rulers and the ruled, and that giving people freedom is not only necessary for the people, but also essential for guaranteeing the legitimate economic interests of certain countries.

Their views are undoubtedly completely correct. Taking the situation in Algeria as an example, the French government refuses to recognize the national rights of the Algerian people and stubbornly implements a policy of armed suppression. However, the Algerian people have not been conquered and cannot be conquered. Therefore, the result can only be: the more blood the Algerian people shed, the more difficult it will be to obtain the understanding of the Algerian people on certain French interests, and the possibility of guaranteeing these interests will be reduced to the point of disappearing. At the same time, the continued intensification of this situation in Algeria will inevitably give countries with greater colonial ambitions an opportunity to take advantage of it and pose a more serious threat to peace. Therefore, the proposition put forward in the joint statement of South, Egypt, and India is entirely in line with the interests of the people of all countries and the interests of peace, and it should be valued by all parties concerned.

Before the summit of the heads of government of South, Egypt, and India, the American propaganda machine constantly said that the meeting "would not produce important results," trying to belittle and minimize the great significance and impact of the meeting. But the unfortunate "Cold War" propagandists went bankrupt again. No matter how hard they shout, they cannot drown out the voice of peace, because the voice of peace is the most powerful voice in the world today.

The Chinese people are satisfied to welcome the results of the South, Egypt, and India summit, and thank the three countries for their support for restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. The Chinese people will work with peace-loving countries to promote peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.

### 南、埃、印三国会谈的积极成果

    南、埃、印三国会谈的积极成果
    最近，埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔和印度总理尼赫鲁访问了南斯拉夫，并同南斯拉夫总统铁托举行了政治会谈。在目前各国人民争取进一步缓和国际局势的情况下，南、埃、印三国政府首脑的会谈，引起了国际舆论的极大注意，人们认为这种会谈肯定是有利于和平的。铁托总统说得好：“在我们的时代，各个国家的负责代表的直接接触和相互访问，正在变为加强民族之间的了解和和解的一种愈来愈正当和有用的方法，从而也就是实现人类巩固世界和平的伟大愿望的一个重要因素。”
    南、埃、印三国会谈的联合声明就证实了这一点。南、埃、印三国都是积极执行和平政策的国家。它们坚持和平共处的原则，坚持民族独立的原则，反对参加对立性的军事集团，主张开展各国之间的经济文化的广泛合作，建立各国之间的平等和友好的关系。三国政府首脑在联合声明中对当前的重大国际问题所表示的一致意见，就很清楚地体现了它们这种共同的政策。这些意见都是同各国人民的愿望和要求一致的。这无疑将在爱好和平的人民的心中引起共鸣。很显然，哪个地区的国家坚持和平政策，哪个地区的紧张局势和不安就会减小，战争威胁就会减弱，和平的保障就会增强。南、埃、印三国会谈的积极成果，有助于扩大和平共处思想的影响，并将有助于进一步扩大欧、亚、非三洲的和平地区。
    南、埃、印三国政府首脑特别关怀着中东和北非的局势。他们认为，必须在尊重民族权利的基础上，和平解决巴勒斯坦问题和阿尔及利亚问题。他们指出，殖民统治对统治者和被统治者都是有害的，给人民以自由，这不但对人民是必需的，而且对于保障某些国家的合法经济利益也是不可少的。
    他们的这种意见无疑是完全正确的。拿阿尔及利亚的情况来说，法国政府不肯承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族权利，固执地实行武力镇压的政策。可是，阿尔及利亚人民并没有被征服，也是不可能被征服的，因此结果只能是：阿尔及利亚人民的血流得越多，就越难取得阿尔及利亚人民对法国某些利益的谅解，而保障这些利益的可能性就会减少以至于消逝。同时，在阿尔及利亚的这种局势继续尖锐化，就必然给殖民野心更大的国家以可乘之机，并对和平造成更严重的威胁。因此，南、埃、印三国的联合声明所提出的主张，完全符合各国人民的利益和和平的利益，它应该得到有关各方的重视。
    在南、埃、印三国政府首脑会谈之前，美国宣传机关曾经不断地说这次会谈“不会产生重要的结果”，想要贬低和缩小这次会谈的重大意义和影响。但是倒霉的“冷战”宣传者又破产了。他们不论怎么拚命喊叫，也无法压过和平的声音，因为和平的声音已是今天世界上最强大的声音了。
    中国人民满意地欢迎南、埃、印三国会谈的成果，并感谢三国对恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利的支持。中国人民将同爱好和平的国家一起，为促进各国人民的和平共处和友好合作而努力。
