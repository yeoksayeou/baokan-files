Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 13th: This year, in the first half of the year, an average of more than eighty young people in Tianjin have taken up jobs every day. Some of these young people have gone to various industrial departments of the central government to work in technical, surveying, and drafting positions, or as apprentices; some have gone to Gansu, Qinghai, and other places to work as primary school teachers and in administrative positions; and some are working as apprentices in factories and enterprises in Tianjin.

Most of these young people are students who failed to enter middle school in the past year or two. After arriving at their new jobs, these young people start working after a short period of training. Apprentices assigned to factories and enterprises in Tianjin can generally master the technology quickly with the help of experienced masters, and some are already able to operate independently. Among the enterprises in Tianjin that have recruited more young people, such as the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, 410 of the 456 new apprentices recruited this year have been upgraded due to their achievements in learning technology, approaching or exceeding the production quotas of their masters.

    天津市一批社会青年就业
    新华社天津13日电　在今年上半年内，天津市平均每天有八十多名社会青年走上工作岗位。这些社会青年有的到中央各工业部门担任技术、测量、绘图工作或者当学徒；有的去甘肃、青海等地担任小学教师和行政职务；有的在天津市工厂企业单位做徒工。
    这批社会青年中，大部分是最近一二年未能考入中学的学生。这些青年到达新的工作岗位以后，经过短期训练，就开始工作。分配在天津工厂企业的徒工在老师傅们的帮助下，一般都能很快地掌握技术，有的已经能够独立操作。天津各企业中录用社会青年较多的天津自行车厂，今年所录用的456名新徒工中，已经有410名因学习技术有成绩，接近或超过了老师傅的生产定额，被升了级。
