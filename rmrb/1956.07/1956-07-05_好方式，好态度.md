    Good Methods, Good Attitude
    Wang Pu
    In our country, the service industry is connected to the lives of millions of people. If people want to live happily, they rely on arranging their own clothing, food, housing, and transportation on the one hand; on the other hand, they also eagerly hope that society will have various service industries, better service methods, and better service attitudes.
    The reputation of Shanghai's service industry is very high throughout the country, and many people feel that living in Shanghai is really convenient in every way. Judging from the snippets of information about Shanghai's service industry introduced by this newspaper in the past two days, it is no wonder that people still talk about the people who serve the broad masses of the people there with nostalgia after leaving Shanghai. Why? Because they solved many problems that families could not solve themselves but urgently needed to solve through diverse service methods. For example, "turning worn-out trousers into new ones" and "having clothes washed and dyed without leaving home" are all welcomed by the broad masses of the people.
    However, we cannot see industries that serve the people's lives as thoughtfully as in Shanghai in many cities; the service industries in some cities often lack a warm service attitude. For example, in many cities, it is relatively difficult to alter an old piece of clothing or replace a shirt collar; as for turning worn-out trousers into new ones, it is almost a pipe dream. Many people also frequently encounter cold looks from service personnel in service industries—clothing stores, laundry and dyeing shops, and restaurants—and customers can only shake their heads and walk out. Many service industries use "supply falling short of demand" as an excuse and rarely try to improve their business conditions, increase service methods, or correct erroneous service attitudes. We cannot simply blame certain service personnel; we should look through these phenomena to see the thinking of the leading staff who manage the service industry, which is primarily caused by their lack of attention to this work, because they rarely care about improving this aspect of the work.
    With the development of our country's socialist construction, more and more people are participating in various work and studies, and many housewives are asking to get rid of housework as much as possible in order to work better and study better. Therefore, how to expand the scope of business of the service industry and improve the quality of service in cities has become an urgent problem to be solved. The specific goal should be to learn from Shanghai. It is hoped that all employees of the departments managing the service industry in various cities will pay attention to this article published today and regard it as a reference for improving their work.

    好方式，好态度
    王朴
    服务行业在我们国家里，和千百万人的生活连在一起。人们要生活得愉快，一方面靠自己安排自己的衣、食、住、行；另一方面，也十分渴望社会上有各种各样的服务行业、有更好的服务方式、有更好的服务态度。
    上海市服务行业的声誉在全国是很高的，许多人都觉得生活在上海，真是事事方便。从前昨两天本报所介绍的上海服务行业一些片断的情况看，难怪人们离开上海后，仍带着留恋之情，谈论那里为广大人民服务的人们。为什么呢？因为他们通过多样的服务方法，解决了许多家庭自己无法解决而又迫切需要解决的问题。例如“破裤子翻新”“洗染衣服不用出门”等等，都是为广大人民所欢迎的。
    但是，我们在许多城市中却看不到像上海市那样周到地为人民生活服务的行业；有的城市中的服务性行业，常常缺少热情的服务态度。比如在不少的城市中，想改一件旧衣服、换一个衬衣领子都是比较困难的；至于破裤子翻新，几乎是妄想。也有不少的人，时常在服务的行业——服装店、洗染店、饭馆里，碰到服务人员的冷眼，顾客只有摇头走出。不少的服务行业；借口“供不应求”；很少设法改进营业状况、增加服务方法、纠正错误的服务态度。我们不能单责备某些服务人员，应该透过这些现象看一看管理服务行业的领导工作人员的思想，首先是他们不重视这一工作所引起的，因为他们很少关心这方面工作的改进。
    随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，参加各种工作和学习的人愈来愈多，不少的家庭妇女要求尽量摆脱家务事，以便工作得更好、学习得更好。因此，在城市中如何扩大服务行业的业务范围，提高服务质量，已是一个迫切需要解决的问题了。具体的目标应是向上海看齐。希望各城市管理服务行业的部门的全体职工，都重视今天发表的这篇文章，把它当作改进工作的参考。
