Just Because They Don't Understand the Policy
He Cheng

Many areas in the Southwest and Central South regions are preparing to achieve advanced cooperativization around the autumn harvest. The local Party and government leading organs and the broad masses of farmers are preparing for this matter.

There are two different situations for primary agricultural production cooperatives preparing to upgrade: most cooperatives are actively improving their business management and increasing production content so that after upgrading and merging, the advanced cooperatives they join will have a good order and a solid "foundation."

A few cooperatives are doing things differently: they are not planting late rice, not planting miscellaneous grains, digging up unripe potatoes, and even cutting down good fruit trees, saying, "Anyway, we are going to transition to advanced cooperatives, it's better to get less than more, and better to get something now than later."

If these people knew that the potatoes they were digging up were their own, and the fruit trees they were cutting down were also their own, who would do such a foolish thing? In their view, these things are theirs today, but will not be theirs tomorrow; although they will be a part of the advanced cooperative in the future, these things will be combined into a "big pile."

Of course, this absolutely cannot be blamed on the farmers. The reason they do this is simply because they don't understand the policy. Only publicizing the importance of achieving advanced cooperativization, but not correctly and comprehensively publicizing the policies of advanced cooperativization, can easily lead to such results.

Farmers are concerned about various policies of advanced cooperatives, especially the policies of advanced cooperatives for handling economic issues. At the time of changes in production relations, everyone has to consider what benefits they will get in the new economic organization and what losses they may suffer. Why do those who have lost their labor power and have previously relied solely on land remuneration in primary cooperatives also support the abolition of land remuneration and are willing to join advanced cooperatives? The main reason is only one: advanced cooperatives implement the "five guarantees," and they have support for their birth, old age, illness, and death. Why are both the middle peasants who possess more and better means of production and the poor peasants who possess fewer and worse means of production willing to join advanced cooperatives? The main reason is also only one: advanced cooperatives can bring benefits to everyone and will not make middle peasants or poor peasants suffer losses. As long as these principles are made clear and the methods for handling economic issues during the process of merging and upgrading primary cooperatives are made clear, people will not do those foolish things.

Now, the model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives have been promulgated. It clearly and specifically stipulates the policies for handling economic issues. The means of production other than land of poor and middle peasants continue to be brought into the cooperative by adopting mutually beneficial methods. Land should be unconditionally collectivized, but for members who have completely lost their labor power and have historically relied on land income to maintain their lives, after joining the advanced cooperative, if the public welfare fund is temporarily insufficient to maintain their lives, appropriate land remuneration can still be given temporarily. This is so thoughtful, reasonable, and appropriate!

The model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives are a powerful weapon that will promote the consolidation of the existing hundreds of thousands of advanced cooperatives and attract primary cooperative members to quickly join advanced cooperatives. The primary thing now is to tell the farmers the spirit and content of this model regulation, so that the phenomena mentioned above will naturally not occur.

    只是因为他们不懂政策
    何成
    西南、中南的不少地区，将要在秋收前后实现高级合作化。当地的党政领导机关和广大农民，正在给这件事情作准备。
    准备升级的初级农业生产合作社有两种不同的情况：多数社积极改进经营管理，增加生产内容，以便升级、合并以后，使自己参加的高级社有个良好的秩序，深厚的“底子”。
    少数社的作法就不同了：他们晚稻不插，杂粮不种，不熟的马铃薯也刨了，很好的果木树也砍了，还说：“反正要转高级社，多得不如少得，少得不如现得。”
    如果这些人知道刨的马铃薯是自己的，砍的果木树也是自己的，谁还干这种傻事呢？在他们看来，这些东西今天是自己的，明天就不是自己的了；虽然自己将来是高级社的一个组成部分，但这些东西却要合成“大堆”了。
    当然，这绝对不能怨农民。他们所以这样作，只是因为不懂政策。只宣传实现高级化的重要性，却不正确地、全面地宣传高级化的政策，就很容易发生这样的结果。
    农民关心高级社的各种政策，特别是高级社处理经济问题的政策。在生产关系变化的时候，谁都要考虑自己在新的经济组织中会得到什么好处，可能遭受什么损失。为什么那些丧失了劳动力的、曾经在初级社中专门依靠土地报酬生活的人，也赞成取消土地报酬，愿意参加高级社呢？主要原因只有一个：高级社实行“五保”，他们的生养死葬都有了依靠。为什么占有生产资料较多较好的中农，和占有生产资料较少较坏的贫农，都愿意参加高级社呢？主要原因也只有一个：高级社能给大家带来好处，不会使中农或者贫农吃亏。只要把这些道理说清楚，把初级社合并升级过程中处理经济问题的办法说清楚，人们就不会干那些傻事了。
    现在，高级农业生产合作社示范章程已经公布了。这里边明确、具体地规定了处理经济问题的政策。贫农、中农除了土地以外的生产资料，继续采取互利办法入社。土地是应该无条件公有化的了，但是，对于完全丧失劳动力，历来靠土地收入维持生活的社员，参加高级社以后，如果公益金一时不够维持生活的，还可以暂时给以适当的土地报酬。这是多么照顾周到，合情合理！
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程是一个有力的武器，它将推动已有的几十万个高级社更加巩固，吸引初级社社员迅速参加到高级社中。现在的首要事情，是把这个示范章程的精神和内容告诉农民，这样，上面说的那些现象，自然而然就不会发生了。
