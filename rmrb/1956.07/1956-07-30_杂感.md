    Random Thoughts

    There was a time when – critics were beaten to death with one blow;
    Now it has been discovered that – those who are criticized are beaten to death with one blow (past criticisms were all wrong).
    It's like a relay race, passing the stick to each other. Brothers in adversity, a pair of stick-wielding adherents.
    Let's all drop the sticks and practice the doctrine of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient"!
          ＊
    Regarding movies, in addition to the "buy one get one free" deal (see this paper's 26th and 27th editions), there is an even more straightforward method. This time, the matter occurred in Shenyang (July 21st "Shenyang Daily"). The movie theater, through the police station and neighborhood committee, "organized" residents to buy tickets, regardless of whether they had seen the movie or not, everyone had to buy a ticket. The slogan was "If you don't watch it yourself, you can give it to someone else." Even sixty-year-old men with failing eyesight and those who couldn't afford the ticket price were not exempt. If it was really too difficult, residents of the same courtyard would share the cost of buying three tickets and then draw lots to see the movie.
    From any perspective, this kind of "forced entertainment" method has nothing "advanced" about it.
    Once power is in hand, there is a possibility of making the mistake of "commandism," even for movie theaters...

    曾经有一个时候——一棍子打死批评者；
    如今又发现了——一棍子打死被批评者（过去的批评都错了）。
    好像是接力赛跑，彼此传递棍子。难兄难弟，一对棍子主义者。
    还是大家丢掉棍子，实行“惩前毖后，治病救人”主义吧！

    关于电影，除有“买一送一”的事外（见二十六日、二十七日本版），还有更干脆的办法。这回，事情出在沈阳（七月二十一日“沈阳日报”）。电影院通过派出所、街道办事处，“组织”居民买票，不管看过与否，一律要买。口号为“自己不看，可以送人”。即使眼睛快瞎的六十老翁和出不起票价的人，也无例外。实在太困难的，由同院子居民分摊合购三张，然后抓阄看电影。
    不论从哪一方面来说，这种“强迫娱乐”法没有什么“先进”之处。
    一朝权在手，便有犯“强迫命令”的毛病的可能，即使是电影院也好……
