(Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")

　　13　After planting the trees, the young men crowded into the club. Shuming praised the female comrades for doing a good job. Yinghua knew Shuming was there, but didn't turn her head. The young men and women teased each other, and the whole room was filled with laughter.

　　14　Just as the laughter was lively, the door burst open with a "bang!", and Shuming's father, Luo Tai, stormed in with a tight face. Everyone knew the old man's volatile temper. Seeing his expression, they expected trouble and couldn't help but be stunned.

　　15　Luo Tai opened his mouth and cursed Li Baichuan: "The advanced cooperative is finished, damn it! Our second cooperative is about to be bled dry! ... They only leave 3% for the public accumulation fund. Isn't that exploitation when we merge like this? ......"

　　16　It turned out that the first cooperative had more than 7,000 yuan in public accumulation funds, while the second cooperative only had about 600 yuan. Some members of the first cooperative were already dissatisfied. Hearing Luo Tai's words, they "buzzed" with discussion. The young women of the second cooperative were all stunned, and Yinghua's face turned red.

    并社（四）
    屠鸿痕改编·江荧　画
    （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    13　种完树的小伙子们，拥进俱乐部，树明赞扬女同志们工作做得好。莺花明知树明来了，却头也不回。小伙子们和小闺女们互相逗嘴，全屋子充满了笑声。
    14　正笑得热闹，门“拍?”一敞，树明的爹罗泰紧绷着脸撞了进来。这老爷子的暴躁脾气是大家都知道的。看他这付神情，料想必有是非，不由得一楞。
    15　罗泰开口就骂李百川：“高级社的事，算他妈的吧！咱快叫二社刮出血来啦！………他们只留公积金百分之三，这样并过来，不是剥削主义是啥呀？………”
    16　原来一社有公积金七千多元，二社只有六百来元，一社有的社员本来有些不满，听罗泰这一说，更“嗡嗡”议论起来。二社的小闺女们全楞了，莺花的脸涨得血红。
