How to Strengthen Field Management of Peanuts
Wang Shou, Deputy Director of the General Bureau of Grain Production, Ministry of Agriculture

This year, many major peanut-producing areas have not completed their spring planting plans. Many regions encountered unfavorable natural conditions during spring planting, and in addition, some regions used poor-quality peanut seeds, resulting in widespread seedling shortages. Field management should be strengthened to compensate for the losses from insufficient planting.

In many peanut-producing areas with seedling shortages, the first priority should be to check the seedlings and replant where necessary. For replanting, early-maturing sesame should generally be used. Sesame seeds are needed in small quantities, making it easy to find seeds; moreover, its growth period is shorter than that of peanuts, allowing it to be harvested at the same time as peanuts. Sesame and peanuts have different heights, so planting them on the same plot allows each to utilize different spaces for growth and development, increasing the total yield per unit area.

Summer-planted peanuts have a shorter growing season, so it is very important to strengthen the cultivation of seedlings to ensure they grow strongly. Currently, many peanut-producing areas have excessive rainfall, and many peanut fields have soil compaction and are overgrown with weeds. These are all unfavorable for the growth of peanut seedlings. In such areas, ditching for drainage, loosening the soil, and weeding should be done well. In the seedling stage, peanuts do not yet have well-developed root nodules, or have few root nodules, so they cannot fully utilize atmospheric nitrogen as nutrients. At this time, decomposed human and animal manure, oil cake, ammonium sulfate, and other fertilizers rich in nitrogen should be applied. Areas flooded by water should also be immediately replanted with early-maturing sesame after the water has been drained.

The planting quality of spring-planted peanuts this year is generally poor, so field management should be particularly strengthened. Spring-planted peanuts have a long flowering period and require a lot of water and nutrients (phosphorus and potassium). It is necessary to apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as wood ash and superphosphate in conjunction with soil loosening near the flowering period. If there is a drought, the fields should be irrigated once each near the flowering period, during the flowering period, and in the early stage of pod formation. Peanut flowering starts at the bottom of the stem and gradually extends to the middle and upper parts. In the later stage of flowering, the flowers in the middle and upper parts are too far from the ground, making it difficult for the gynophores to enter the soil. Therefore, earthing up and vine pressing during the peak flowering period can shorten the distance between the flowers in the middle and upper parts and the ground, increasing the gynophore's rate of entry into the soil. Combining earthing up and vine pressing, topping the main stem by two inches (i.e., topping) during the peak flowering period is also an important measure to increase production. Each peanut-producing area can also conduct some experiments based on specific conditions to create conditions for future promotion.

This spring, the oil crop policy in some areas was not implemented deeply enough, and economic work was not done well. These areas should continue to promote the policies of "more production, more gain, and more production, more retention" to reward oil crop production, as well as reasonable pricing policies. Commercial fertilizers for peanut fields should be distributed as soon as possible. If these tasks are done well, the enthusiasm of farmers planting oil crops to increase peanut production will be high, and they will be more willing to strengthen summer peanut management and adopt advanced technologies. This spring in Guangdong Province, due to drought and low morale among some farmers to produce oil crops, the progress of peanut planting in some areas was slow. In response to this situation, the Provincial People's Committee promoted the oil crop policy, announced peanut pre-purchase methods, and resolved some specific problems, accelerating the planting speed and making it easier to promote advanced technologies. Most areas have adopted rhizobium inoculation and appropriate close planting.

China has a long history of peanut cultivation, and farmers in various regions have rich experience in summer field management. Each peanut-producing area should explore these experiences and summarize and promote them. Recently, Hebei Province held a summer crop field management conference, summarizing and exchanging field management experiences for peanuts and other crops. This is a very timely move.

Generally speaking, the season for replanting peanut fields has passed in most areas, but it is still possible to increase unit yield by strengthening field management of already planted peanuts. The experience of many areas proves that the potential for increasing production in this aspect of peanuts is very large. Rural workers and cooperative members in each peanut-producing area should seize this link and strive to harvest more peanuts this year on the already planted area.

    怎样加强花生的田间管理
    农业部粮食生产总局副局长　王绶
    今年许多主要花生产区没有完成春播计划。不少地区在春播中遇到不利的自然条件，加上有些地区使用的花生种子不好，因此普遍缺苗。应该加强田间管理，补救播种不够的损失。
    许多花生产区缺苗，首先应该作好查苗补种工作。补种用的作物，一般应该采用早熟芝麻。芝麻种子需要的少，找种子容易；而且生育期比花生短，补种后可以和花生同时收获。芝麻和花生高矮不同，在同一块地上种植，可以各自利用不同的空间生长发育，增加单位面积的总产量。
    夏播花生生长期较短，加强幼苗期的培育，使幼苗生长健壮是很重要的事情。目前许多花生产区雨水过多，不少花生田土壤板结，杂草丛生。这些都是不利花生幼苗生长的。这样的地区，应该做好开沟排水和松土除草工作。花生在幼苗期，根瘤还没有长好或是根瘤不多，因此不能充分利用空中氮素作为养料。这时候可以施入腐熟的人畜粪尿、油饼、硫酸铵等含氮素较多的肥料。被水淹毁的地区，在排清积水后，也要立即改种早熟芝麻。
    今年春种花生的播种质量一般较差，田间管理也应该特别加强。春种花生开花期长，需要水分和养分（磷、钾）很多。结合接近开花时的一次松土，施入草木灰、过磷酸钙等磷钾肥料是必要的。如遇天旱，在接近开花时和开花期以及结荚初期，还应该分别灌水一次。花生开花是由茎秆下部开始，逐渐开到中部上部，到了开花后期，中部上部的花距离地面过远，果锥不易入土。因此，在盛花期实行培土压蔓，可以缩短中、上部的花和地面的距离，增加果锥的入土率。结合培土压蔓，在盛花期把主茎顶端剪去二寸（即打顶），也是增产的重要措施。各花生产区也可以根据具体情况进行一些试验，为将来推广创造条件。
    今年春季有些地区的油料政策贯彻的不够深入，经济工作也没有作好。这样的地区，应该继续向群众宣传“多产多得、增产多留”的奖励油料生产的政策和合理的价格政策。应该供应花生田使用的商品肥料，必须早些发放下去。这些工作作好了，种植油料农民的增产花生的积极性就会高涨起来，他们就更愿意加强花生的夏季管理和采用先进技术了。广东省今年春季因为天旱和不少农民生产油料的情绪不高，有些地区的花生播种进度缓慢。省人民委员会针对这种情况，宣传了油料政策，公布了花生预购办法，并解决了一些具体问题，播种的速度加快了，先进的技术的推广也容易了，多数地区都采用了根瘤菌拌种和适当密植。
    我国种植花生已有相当长的历史，各地农民都有丰富的夏田管理经验。各花生产区应该发掘这些经验并加以总结推广。最近河北省召开夏季作物田间管理会议，总结和交流了花生等作物的田间管理经验。这样作是很适时的。
    就大部地区说，补种花生地的季节已经过去了，但是加强对已种下的花生的田间管理，从而提高单位产量，还是很可能的。许多地区的经验证明，花生的这一方面的增产潜力很大。各花生产区的农村工作人员和合作社社员，应该抓住这个环节，努力争取在今年已经播种了的面积上，收获更多的花生。
