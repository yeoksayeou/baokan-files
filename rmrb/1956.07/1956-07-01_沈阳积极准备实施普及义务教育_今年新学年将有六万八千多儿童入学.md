    Shenyang Actively Prepares to Implement Universal Compulsory Education
    This New Semester Will See Over 68,000 Children Enrolled
    (Our Newspaper) News: Shenyang City is actively carrying out preparations for implementing universal compulsory education. When the new semester begins this year, the city will have more than 68,000 school-age children enrolled, accounting for 93.8% of the total number of school-age children in the city (including suburban areas) who have not yet been enrolled, an increase of more than 8% in the enrollment rate compared to 1955.
    In order to implement universal compulsory education, Shenyang City has built nine school buildings that can accommodate more than 13,000 children. At the same time, this year it is planned to expand enrollment quotas in ten primary schools attached to factories and mines. This summer vacation, more than 1,400 graduates from junior and intermediate normal schools in Shenyang City will be assigned as primary school teachers. One hundred and twenty primary school principals and teaching directors will also complete their studies at the Shenyang City Primary School Administrative Cadre Training Class. The Shenyang City In-service Primary School Teachers' Refresher School will be further expanded and strengthened, and a correspondence department has been established. It is planned to raise the level of 2,500 teachers in the city who do not have the graduation level of junior normal schools to the graduation level of junior normal schools within three years. At the beginning of the new semester, Shenyang City also plans to select twelve complete primary schools with better conditions in urban and suburban areas to enroll first-year junior high school students. Three years later, these schools will be gradually expanded into nine-year consistent schools to create conditions for the future implementation of the nine-year consistent universal compulsory education throughout the city. Currently, the Shenyang Municipal Education Bureau is working hard to conduct a census of children who have not yet been enrolled. (Wen)

    沈阳积极准备实施普及义务教育
    今年新学年将有六万八千多儿童入学
    本报讯　沈阳市正积极进行普及义务教育的准备工作。今年新的学年开始的时候，全市将有六万八千多名学龄儿童入学，占全市（包括郊区在内）尚未入学的学龄儿童总数的93.8％，就学率比1955年增加8％以上。
    为实施普及义务教育，沈阳市已经修建了九所可以容纳一万三千多名儿童的校舍。同时，今年将有计划地在十所厂矿附属小学扩大招生名额。今年暑假，沈阳市将有一千四百多名初级和中级师范学校的毕业生被分配作小学教师。一百二十名小学校长、教导主任也将在沈阳市小学行政干部训练班学习结束。沈阳市在职小学教师进修学校将进一步扩大和加强，并且成立了函授部。计划在三年内使全市二千五百名不是初级师范毕业水平的教师提高到初级师范毕业水平。在新的学年开始的时候，沈阳市还计划在市区和郊区选出十二个条件较好的完全小学招收初中一年级学生。三年后，这些学校将逐步扩充成九年一贯制的学校，为将来全市推行九年一贯制普及义务教育创造条件。目前，沈阳市教育局正紧张进行未入学儿童的普查工作。　（文）
