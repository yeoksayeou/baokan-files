The Land of Lakes, Forests, and Granite
——An Introduction to the Karelian Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic——
　　Open the Soviet map, look for the northwest corner, the area between the White Sea and Lake Ladoga is the Karelian Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic. Right, your map must still say "Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic". That was just a few days ago: on July 16th, the joint meeting of the Soviet Supreme Soviet Union and Nationalities Councils, taking into account the national composition and economic and cultural characteristics of the Karelian-Finnish Republic, accepted the request of the people of this republic and decided to change this Union Republic into an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation.
　　You can see on the map that 15% of the 179,000 square kilometers of the Karelian Autonomous Republic are marked with light blue lakes, and Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in the south are the largest lakes in Europe. And the black arrows indicating forests almost cover two-thirds of the land. Its abundant resources—timber and granite—supply the needs of various parts of the Soviet Union. The houses in Donbas are built with Karelian timber; the books read by Georgian farmers and the notebooks used by Uzbek students are all made of Karelian paper; the Moscow and Leningrad subways have many dazzling granite and marble stones transported from here... No wonder people call Karelia "the land of lakes, forests, and granite."
　　Currently, 606,000 Karelians, Russians, and Finns live on this rich land, living a happy life under Soviet power. However, the history of Karelia is full of bitter chapters. During the Tsarist era, Karelia was a deserted place, called "a country where birds would not be startled." Its abundant resources were undeveloped, and the economy and culture were very backward. At that time, there were almost no industries here except for a few handicraft workshops. In 1904, in the only large factory—the Alexandrov shell factory—workers worked twelve hours a day and received only eighteen rubles a month. Many people were driven from the cultivated land into the large forests to cut timber with crude tools, and their wages for each season (a season is five or six months) were only twenty-two rubles. Very few people were literate, and the people lived in poverty and ignorance.
　　Karelia's past also has something in common with Siberia; it used to be a place of exile for political prisoners. Many famous revolutionaries, such as Kalinin, were exiled here. Therefore, the sparks of revolution had long ignited in this remote and desolate place.
　　The great October Revolution illuminated Karelia. In 1923, the Karelian Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic was established. On March 12, 1940, the Soviet Union and Finland signed a peace treaty, and the new territories belonging to the Soviet Union under the treaty were also assigned to Karelia. On March 31, 1940, the Soviet Supreme Soviet decided, according to the wishes of the Karelian people, to change the Karelian Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, becoming one of the sixteen Union Republics of the Soviet Union.
　　Now, let’s look at the map again and see the crystallization of the victory of the Communist Party’s great national policy in the era of Soviet power. In the era of Soviet power, the face of Karelia has completely changed, and large cities such as Segezha, Kondopoga, and Medvezhyegorsk have appeared on the map. From Lake Onega to the White Sea there is the Stalin White Sea-Baltic Canal, which is 227 kilometers long and was completed in 1933. It connects the Baltic Sea with the northern regions of the Soviet Union, opening up broad prospects for the development of Karelia's rich reserves. Before World War I, there was not a single railway in Karelia. The 760-kilometer-long Murmansk Railway (now the Kirov Railway) was started during World War I, but it was not completed until after the revolution. Now, railways, canals, and highways are intertwined throughout Karelia.
　　As early as before World War II, Karelia's power, machine manufacturing, pulp and paper, wood processing, and mining industries were established. Today, in the densely forested areas, dozens of large-scale sawmills have appeared. In these enterprises, all work from logging, transportation to loading onto trains has been mechanized. Comfortable houses, public canteens, hospitals and schools have been built for workers near the factories. Karelia has become the center of the Soviet Union's largest cellulose and paper industry. The Sixth Five-Year Plan paid great attention to the development of Karelia's forest and paper industry.
　　The lakes that cover the entire territory of Karelia are connected by many rivers, which provides it with rich water resources. In the era of Soviet power, the development of water power has occupied an important position in the national construction. Power generation in 1940 reached 120 times that of 1913, and in 1951 after the war, it increased by more than double that of 1940. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that it will be doubled compared with the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
　　Due to soil reasons, Karelia's agricultural areas are mostly in the south. Many crops that were not previously planted have been sown here. Potatoes and vegetables are the main crops, and their output has almost increased tenfold in the era of Soviet power. Karelia has a cool and humid climate, and good, juicy grasses grow, so animal husbandry is very developed.
　　The cultural life of the Karelian people has also taken on a new look. Illiteracy was eliminated as early as the First Five-Year Plan. In 1940, a National University was established in the capital, Petrozavodsk, and an educational college was opened in 1952. These two institutions of higher learning train hundreds of experts with a high level of expertise for Karelia every year. After the war, Karelia also established a branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and other scientific research institutions, which have played a great role in the development of Karelia's national economy. In 1955, there were 720 primary schools and 18 secondary schools in Karelia. There are clubs, theaters and libraries everywhere. The national literature and art are developing rapidly.
　　Currently, the Karelian people are building a new life together with all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.

    湖泊、森林和花岗石的国土
    ——卡累利阿苏维埃社会主义自治共和国介绍——
    翻开苏联地图，你往西北角上找，在白海和拉多加湖之间这块地方，就是卡累利阿苏维埃社会主义自治共和国。对了，你的地图上一定还是写的“卡累利阿—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国”。那只是前几天的事情：七月十六日，苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院联席会议考虑到卡累利阿—芬兰共和国的民族构成和经济文化的特点，接受这个共和国的人民的要求，决定把这个加盟共和国改为加入俄罗斯联邦的自治共和国。
    你在地图上可以看到，卡累利阿自治共和国的十七万九千平方公里的面积上，15％都是淡蓝色的湖泊标记，南边的拉多加湖和奥涅加湖都是欧洲最大的湖泊。而表示森林的黑箭头几乎遮满了三分之二的土地。这里丰富的物产——木材和花岗石供应苏联各地的需要。顿巴斯的房子是用卡累利阿的木材造的；格鲁吉亚农民读的书、乌兹别克学生的练习本都是用卡累利阿的纸做的；莫斯科和列宁格勒的地下铁道里，许许多多光彩夺目的花岗石、大理石都是从这里运去的……无怪乎人们把卡累利阿叫做“湖泊、森林和花岗石的国土”。
    目前，在这块富饶的土地上，居住着六十万六千卡累利阿人、俄罗斯人和芬兰人，他们在苏维埃政权下过着幸福的生活。可是，卡累利阿的历史却充满了辛酸的章页。沙皇时代，卡累利阿是一个杳无人迹的地方，人们称它是“飞禽不会受惊的国度”。这里丰富的资源没有开发，经济和文化十分落后。当时，这里除了有少数手工业作坊以外，几乎任何工业都没有。1904年，在唯一的大工厂——亚历山大罗夫炮弹制造厂里，工人们每天工作十二小时，一个月才拿十八个卢布的工资。很多人被从耕地上赶到大森林里去，用简陋的工具砍木材，而他们每个季节（一个季节是五、六个月）的工资才有二十二个卢布。识字的人很少很少，人民过着贫困愚昧的生活。
    卡累利阿的过去也和西伯利亚有着共同之点，它曾是政治犯流放地。很多著名的革命家，如加里宁，就曾被流放到这里过。因此，革命的星火也早就燃到了这个偏僻的荒凉地方。
    伟大的十月革命照亮了卡累利阿。1923年，卡累利阿苏维埃社会主义自治共和国成立了。1940年3月12日苏芬签订和约，根据和约归属苏联的新领土也划归卡累利阿。1940年3月31日苏联最高苏维埃会议，按照卡累利阿人民的愿望，决定将卡累利阿苏维埃社会主义自治共和国改为卡累利阿——芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国，成为苏联十六个加盟共和国的一员。
    现在，我们再来看看地图，看看苏维埃政权年代共产党伟大民族政策的胜利的结晶。在苏维埃政权年代，卡累利阿的面貌完全改变了，谢格热、康多波加、麦德维热戈尔斯克等大城市在地图上出现了。从奥涅加湖到白海有一条全长227公里的斯大林白海——波罗的海运河，这是在1933年建成的，它沟通了波罗的海和苏联北部地区的联系，为开发卡累利阿的富藏打开了广阔的远景。在第一次世界大战以前，卡累利阿境内还没有一条铁路。长达760公里的穆尔曼斯克铁路（现名基洛夫铁路）虽然在第一次世界大战期间就动工了，可是直到革命后才建成。现在，铁路、运河、公路已交织贯通卡累利阿全国各地。
    早在第二次世界大战以前，卡累利阿的动力、机器制造、纸浆和造纸、木材加工、采矿等工业就建立起来了。今天，在森林密布的地带，已出现了几十个大规模的锯木工厂，在这些企业里，从木材的采伐、搬运直到装上火车，全部工作都已机械化。在工厂附近，为工人盖了舒适的住宅、公共食堂、医院和学校。卡累利阿已成为苏联最大的纤维素和造纸业的中心。第六个五年计划对卡累利阿的森林和造纸工业的发展给予很大的注意。
    密布卡累利阿全境的湖泊被很多条河流联在一起，这里有着丰富的水力资源。在苏维埃政权年代，水力的开发在全国建设中占有重要的地位。1940年的发电量达到1913年的120倍，战后1951年比1940年又增长了一倍多。而第六个五年计划规定还要比第五个五年计划提高一倍。
    由于土壤的关系，卡累利阿的农业地区多在南部。这里播种了许多过去没有播种过的作物。马铃薯和蔬菜是主要作物，它的产量在苏维埃政权年代几乎增加了十几倍。卡累利阿的气候凉爽而湿润，生长着良好的多汁草类，因此畜牧业十分发达。
    卡累利阿人民的文化生活也出现了新的面貌，早在第一个五年计划就消灭了文盲。1940年在首府彼得罗查沃德斯克创立了一所国立大学，1952年又开办了一个教育学院。这两所高等学校每年为卡累利阿培养出几百个具有高等水平的专家。战后，卡累利阿又设立了苏联科学院的分院和其它科学研究机关，它们对于卡累利阿的国民经济的发展起了很大的作用。1955年卡累利阿全国有七百二十所初等学校，十八所中等学校。到处都有俱乐部、戏院和图书馆。本民族的文学艺术发展得很快。
    目前，卡累利阿人民正和苏联各族人民一起建设着新生活。
