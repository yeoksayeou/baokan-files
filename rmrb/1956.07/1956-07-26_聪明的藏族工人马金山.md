    The Clever Tibetan Worker Ma Jinshan
    By our reporter Liu Heng

    The Tibetan workers of the First Engineering Office of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications Highway General Bureau like to call Ma Jinshan "Kongming". Because he likes to use his brain and loves to learn advanced things.

    Ma Jinshan is a Tibetan worker who grew up in Lhasa. He is only twenty-four years old this year. In 1953, Little Ma joined the Tibetan workers' team to build the Kangzang Highway. Many of the road builders were Han people, and Little Ma learned to speak Chinese from them. He spelled out the sounds of Chinese characters in Tibetan, wrote them in his notebook, and memorized them every day, learning faster than anyone else.

    Captain Wang of the Tibetan workers' team is a Han Chinese. When he holds meetings in the evening, he asks Little Ma to be the interpreter. One day, Captain Wang called the squad leaders to a meeting. Captain Wang said, "Han workers use shoulder poles to carry soil, walking very fast. Our team can also learn from this." The squad leader said, "We have been carrying things on our backs for generations; using shoulder poles will break our shoulders!"

    The next day, Ma Jinshan asked the squad leader for a shoulder pole and two soil baskets to learn how to carry soil. The first few times, he only filled the baskets halfway. When he straightened his back, he almost fell over. When he ran, he swayed from side to side. The soil baskets swung back and forth like swings, hitting his shins. Slowly, he was able to stand steady, and when the soil baskets were full, they no longer hit his legs. In the evening, after calculating, Ma Jinshan carried one-third more soil than the average worker. Everyone surrounded him, asking questions. Some even took off his clothes to see if his shoulders were broken. On the third day, four workers followed him to learn. On the fourth day, there were fifty-seven people. Now, all five hundred of the team members are using shoulder poles to carry soil.

    Ma Jinshan heard that Han workers were drilling holes in the mountains to set off explosives, blasting off large pieces of rock. One day off, he went to their construction site to learn. After returning, he took three Tibetan workers to experiment. Everyone was worried that the explosion would hurt people. Ma Jinshan said, "It's okay! You drill the holes, and I'll set off the explosives." The workers drilled the holes and loaded the gunpowder. Ma Jinshan told them to run far away, and he went to light the fuse himself. Walking to the front of the blast hole, his heart was pounding, and his hands and feet were shaking, out of his control. He gritted his teeth and thought, "So many Han people haven't died, I won't die either!" With a forceful hand, he lit the gunpowder fuse.

    Ma Jinshan lit the gunpowder fuse and ran away. Before he could reach the others, he heard a "boom" behind him, and the stone mountain blossomed. He saw that the amount of rock blasted open was equivalent to the entire team's work for a day. From then on, the method of drilling holes and blasting mountains spread throughout the Tibetan workers' team.

    Road construction requires sand. The Tibetan workers' team consisted of four people: one to dig, one to load, and two to sift sand. Ma Jinshan thought this was too slow. He remembered the Han people's method: driving a wooden stake into the ground and fixing one end of the sieve, so that only one person was needed to sift. He still thought this method was too slow. He thought, "If two wooden sticks are installed diagonally on the wooden stake, so that the sieve lies on top at an angle, won't the sand automatically sift out when it is poured in?" The results of the experiment showed that the manpower for sifting sand was eliminated, and the speed was increased by one and a half times.

    聪明的藏族工人马金山
    本报记者　刘衡
    交通部公路总局第一工程局第一工程处的藏族工人们喜欢把马金山叫做“孔明”。因为他爱用脑筋，爱学习先进的东西。
    马金山是在拉萨市长大的藏族工人。今年才二十四岁。1953年，小马参加了藏工队，修康藏公路。修路的很多都是汉人，小马就跟他们学汉话。他把汉话的音用藏文一个字一个字地拼出来，写在本子上，天天记，天天背，比谁都学得快。
    藏工队的王队长是汉人，晚上开会，就找小马当翻译。有天，王队长找班长们开会。王队长说：“汉族工人用扁担挑土，走起路来一溜风，我们队也可以学一学。”班长说：“咱们世世代代都是用背筐背东西；用扁担挑，怕把肩膀压破了！”
    第二天，马金山向班长要了一根扁担、两个土筐学挑土。头几回，只装半筐土。一伸腰，差点栽倒了。跑起路来，人东倒西歪。土筐像秋千一样一甩一甩，直打脚杆。慢慢，人能够站稳了，土筐装满了，也不打腿了。晚上一算账，马金山挑的土比一般工人背的要多三分之一。大家都把他团团围住，问这问那。还有人解开他的衣服，看看他的肩膀破没破。第三天，就有四个工人跟着他学。第四天，有五十七人。到现在，全队五百多人都用扁担挑土了。
    马金山听说汉族工人在山上打眼放炮，石头一崩一大片。有天放假，他到他们工地去学。回来之后，他带着三个藏族工人去做试验。大家都很耽心炮会打伤人。马金山说：“不要紧的！你们打眼，炮让我来放。”工人们打好眼，装上火药。马金山叫他们跑得远远的，他自己去点火。走到炮眼跟前，心里扑通扑通乱跳，手脚忽悠忽悠直打颤，不听指挥了。他咬牙一想：“人家那么些汉人都没有死，我也死不了！”猛劲一伸手，就把火药捻子点着了。
    马金山点着了火药捻子，撒腿就跑。还没跑到大伙儿跟前，只听背后“轰”地一响，石头山开花了。一看，打开的石头顶得上他们全队做一天的活。从此，打眼放炮的开山办法在藏工队传开了。
    修路需要用砂子，藏工队由四个人组成一组：一人挖，一人装，两人筛砂子。马金山嫌这样太慢了。他想起汉人的办法：在地上钉一个木桩，把筛子的一头固定，只要一个人筛。他还嫌这个办法太慢。他想：“要是在木桩上斜着安两根木头棍子，让筛子斜着躺在上边。砂土一倒进去，不是就会自动筛出来了吗？试验结果，筛砂子的人力取消了，提高了速度一倍半。
