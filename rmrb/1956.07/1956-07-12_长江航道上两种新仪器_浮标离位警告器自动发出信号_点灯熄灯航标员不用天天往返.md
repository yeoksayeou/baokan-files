    Two New Instruments on the Yangtze River Channel
    Buoy Displacement Alerter Automatically Sends Signals
    Light On/Off Marker No Longer Needs to Travel Back and Forth Daily
    (Our report) The Nanjing Navigation Engineering Area of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has successfully trial-produced the "Buoy Displacement Automatic Alerter" and the "Automated Electrical Light Marker Opener/Closer," and plans to begin promoting their use in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the third quarter.
    The "Buoy Displacement Automatic Alerter" is an instrument installed on ordinary triangular buoy navigation marks. When the buoy is displaced, it can automatically erect a signal pole during the day and automatically emit a signal light at night, while the original light mark automatically extinguishes. In this way, passing ships can avoid accidents such as touching reefs due to buoy displacement. The navigation mark station can also promptly discover the signal and go for repairs.
    Currently, there are still a large number of kerosene navigation lights on the Yangtze River. The marker has to travel twenty to thirty li every day to light and extinguish the marker lights. If the weather is bad, the marker lights are easily extinguished, and the lampshade is easily blackened by soot, making it dim and often causing accidents. The "Automated Electrical Light Marker Opener/Closer" is manufactured in the style of a clock. When using it, you can wind it up and set the pointer to the required time. When it gets dark, the light marker automatically connects to the circuit, using the power of the air dry battery to emit light; when it gets light, it automatically cuts off the power and extinguishes. Each time it is wound, it can be used continuously for eight days and nights. This eliminates the need for the marker to travel back and forth every day.
    After the full promotion of these two new creations, the Yangtze River can realize electrified navigation mark navigation, and marine damage accidents will be greatly reduced. (Qiu Jianhua)

    长江航道上两种新仪器
    浮标离位警告器自动发出信号
    点灯熄灯航标员不用天天往返
    本报讯　交通部长江航运管理局南京航道工程区试制“浮标离位自动警告器”和“自动化电气化灯标开闭器”成功，计划第三季度开始在长江下游推广使用。
    “浮标离位自动警告器”是安装在普通三角浮航标上的一种仪器。当浮标离位时，它在白天能自动竖起一个信号杆，夜晚能自动发出信号灯，原来的灯标即自行熄灭。这样，可以使过往船舶不致因浮标离位而发生触礁等事故。航标站也能及时发现信号前往修理。
    长江目前还有大批的煤油航标灯，航标员每日点燃和熄灭灯标就要往返二三十里路，如果遇到天气恶劣，标灯很容易熄灭，灯罩也容易被烟灰熏黑，发光不亮，常常因此造成事故。“自动化电气化灯标开闭器”是仿照钟表式样制造的，使用时可以上足发条，把指针拨到要求的时间上，一到天黑时，灯标就自动接通电路，利用空气干电池的电源发光；到天亮时，它又自动切断电源熄灭。每上一次发条，可以不间断地使用八个昼夜。这就不需要航标员每天往返了。
    这两项新的创造，全面推广后，长江就可以实现电气化航标导航，海损事故将大大减少。（仇建华）
