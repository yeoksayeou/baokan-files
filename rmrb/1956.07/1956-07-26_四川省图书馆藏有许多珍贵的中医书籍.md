Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 21st: The Sichuan Provincial Library recently compiled a medical bibliography of the traditional Chinese medicine books in its collection, which includes many rare and valuable medical books.

The bibliography includes a formulary, "Taiping Shenghui Fang." This book was compiled by medical officers such as Wang Huaiyin in the early Song Dynasty, who collected more than 16,000 medical formulas popular among the people at that time and compiled them after thirteen years of sorting. It is one of China's great formulary treasures, lost in China during the Ming Dynasty, with only handwritten copies remaining in Japan. When the book collector Yang Shoujing went to Japan at the end of the Qing Dynasty, he hand-copied the book and brought it back to China.

The bibliography also includes fifty-nine volumes of the "Puji Fang," a handwritten fragment that is also rare in China. This is a valuable ancient Chinese medical formulary. It is said that the handwritten fragments collected by the Sichuan Provincial Library were copied by a medical officer in the Imperial Hospital during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty.

The catalog also includes the Ming Dynasty movable-type edition in Chinese of "Dongui Bogam" written by Korean Heo Jun, and medical books written by Japanese medical scientists. These are rare books in China.

This catalog of traditional Chinese medicine books is divided into six categories: general records, pathology, diagnosis, medical prescriptions, medical case studies, medicines, and miscellaneous works, and includes 1,332 kinds, 2,996 copies, and 8,536 volumes of medical works by various experts throughout Chinese history. It is ten times more comprehensive than the medical books included in the "Si Ku Quan Shu" of the Qing Dynasty. Among them, there are more than sixty kinds of famous works annotating and commenting on "Treatise on Cold Damage."

    四川省图书馆藏有许多珍贵的中医书籍
    据新华社成都21日电　四川省图书馆最近将馆内收藏的中医书籍编成了一部医学书目，书目中所列的有许多是国内少有的珍贵医学书籍。
    书目中编入了一部方书“太平圣惠方”。这书是宋代初年医官王怀隐等搜集当时民间盛行的一万六千多个医方，经过十三年的整理工作，编汇出来的。它是我国伟大的方书宝典之一，在明代即已失传，仅日本存有手抄本。清末藏书家杨守敬到日本时，将此书手抄回国。
    书目中还编入国内也少有的手抄残本的“普济方”五十九本。这是我国古代编纂的一种珍贵的医学方书。据说四川省图书馆收藏的手抄残本是清代康熙年间的一个医官在皇宫太医院里抄写出来的。
    目录中还编入了朝鲜许浚著
  “东医宝鉴”的明代汉文活字本和日本医学家所著的医学书籍。这些都是国内稀有的藏书。
    这部中医书籍目录共分总录、病理、诊断、医方、医案、药物、杂著等六类，收录了我国历代各家医学著述1，332种、2，996部共8，536册。它比清代四库全书所收录医书多十倍。其中单是注解和通论“伤寒论”的名家著述就有六十多种。
