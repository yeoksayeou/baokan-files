　　Shenyang Dispatch: The renovation project of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory, the first electrical factory designed independently by China, has been basically completed. In mid-June, the National Acceptance Committee inspected the factory and officially announced its handover for production.

　　Before the renovation, the factory had only 94 machine tools and could only produce relatively simple communication equipment such as telephones and transceivers. Starting in 1952, the factory underwent a comprehensive renovation, expanding six workshops, including metalworking, stamping, and assembly, and two independent sections for machine repair and electrical repair; a new sheet metal workshop and an independent plumbing section were built. The designed production capacity increased by 21 times compared to before the renovation, and the planned total production value for 1956 increased by 11 times compared to 1952. Now, this factory has become the largest low-voltage switch factory in China. It will produce a large number of explosion-proof magnetic starters, crane control equipment, and lathe control equipment to supply modern mines, heavy machinery factories, and machine manufacturing factories in China with a large number of electrical equipment.

　　In the process of renovating and producing simultaneously, the factory has successively trial-produced and produced 285 kinds of products, of which explosion-proof starters have met 80% of the national needs. The quality of the factory's products has also become stable. From 1953 to 1955, the profits turned over to the state by this factory have reached 91% of the state's investment in the renovation of the factory.

　　The Acceptance Committee's appraisal believes that the quality of the factory's renovation project basically meets the design requirements, but the technical safety considerations are insufficient, and it is necessary to improve it according to the items proposed in the appraisal report.

    沈阳低压开关厂改建完工
    本报沈阳电　第一个由中国自行设计的电器工厂——沈阳低压开关厂的改建工程已经基本结束，六月中旬，国家验收委员会验收了这个工厂，并且正式宣布移交生产。
    这个工厂在改建以前，仅有九十四台机床，只能做些比较简单的电话机、收发报机等通讯设备。从1952年开始，这个工厂进行了全面的改建，共扩建了金工、冲剪、装配等六个车间，机修、电修两个独立工段；新建了一个冷作车间和独立的水暖工段。设计生产能力比改建以前提高二十一倍，1956年计划达到的生产总值比1952年提高十一倍。现在，这座工厂已经成为我国目前最大的低压开关厂。它将大量生产防爆磁力起动机、吊车控制设备，以及车床控制设备等，供应我国现代化矿山、重型机器厂、机器制造厂以大批电器装备。
    在边改建边生产的过程中，这座工厂已经先后试制和生产了285种产品，其中防爆起动机已经满足了国家需要的80％。这座工厂产品的质量也已趋于稳定。从1953年到1955年，这座工厂上交给国家的利润，已经达到国家对这座工厂改建投资额的91％。
    验收委员会鉴定认为，这座工厂改建工程质量基本上符合设计要求，但是在技术安全方面考虑不够，还需要按照鉴定书所提出的项目加以改进。
