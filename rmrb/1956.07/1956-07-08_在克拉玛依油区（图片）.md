In the Karamay Oilfield

The era of Karamay slumbering in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang is over. When the vanguards of national construction – the exploration teams – discovered it to be the most promising large oilfield, its name, once unfamiliar, became alluring. Now, several exploratory wells in the Karamay oil region have gushed thick, dark brown crude oil, and several others have shown signs of oil. According to calculations based on this year's exploration area, the oil reserves here already exceed those of the Yumen Laojunmiao Oilfield several times over. Many units across the country are enthusiastically providing manpower and material support to ensure that Karamay can produce oil as soon as possible.

The hundreds of kilometers of telephone lines and highways in the Karamay oil exploration area are under intensive construction. Upon completion, the exploration area will initially form a network of roads and telephone lines, enabling timely transport of large quantities of equipment and materials. This group of telephone line erectors is currently stringing telephone wires.

Soviet experts can be seen guiding work near the derricks in the Karamay oilfield every day. This is Soviet derrick installation expert Krasov (left), Soviet drilling expert Gannichkin (right), and chief engineer of the exploration area, Wang Bingcheng (center), discussing the installation of a new drilling rig.

The oil testing workers in the oil region are actively launching a socialist emulation drive, carrying out oil testing work. These oil testing team workers are carefully loading crude oil into oil drums, preparing to transport it to the Dushanzi Refinery of the Xinjiang Petroleum Company for refining.

The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is using significant resources to support the development of the Karamay area. They have allocated hundreds of trucks, thousands of laborers, and dozens of highway and water conservancy engineering technicians. This is Wen Jincai, a model worker from the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, participating in the development of Karamay. Since arriving here, he has consistently exceeded his work quota every day.

These are new-style lathes and drilling machines produced by the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory in Northeast China in 1956 to support the Karamay oil region.

This is the Karamay Model Drilling Team. Since April, they have exceeded their drilling tasks every month and recently set a new record of drilling 393 meters per day. These workers are working on the drilling platform.

Young people from Shanghai who came to Karamay, after a hard day's work, gather together to enjoy an evening of entertainment.

At the Karamay material storage yard, a large number of drilling materials can be seen, ready to be supplied to various exploration areas.

    在克拉玛依油区
    克拉玛依沉睡在新疆准噶尔盆地的年代过去了。当建设祖国的尖兵——勘探队员们发现它是最有希望的大油田时，它的名字由陌生而变得引诱人了。现在，克拉玛依油区已经有好几口探井喷出深褐色的浑厚的原油，还有几口井有了原油的显示。根据今年勘探地区的计算，这里的储油量已超过玉门老君庙油田好几倍。全国许多单位为了使克拉玛依能早日出油，正热情地进行人力物力上的支援。

    克拉玛依石油探区数百公里长的电话线和公路正在加紧施工。完工以后，探区将初步形成公路和电话线路网，使大批的器材和物资能及时运来。这一组电话线路架线工人，正在架设电话线。
    克拉玛依油区每天都可以看到苏联专家在井架旁指导工作。这是苏联井架安装专家?克拉索夫（左）、苏联钻井专家甘尼奇金（右）同探区总工程师王炳诚（中）研究新钻井的安装问题。
    油区的试油工人们正积极展开社会主义竞赛，进行试油工作。这几位试油队的工人正小心地将原油装到油桶里，准备运往新疆石油公司独山子炼油厂炼油。
    新疆维吾尔自治区用很大的力量支援克拉玛依地区的开发工作。他们抽调了几百辆卡车、几千个劳动力、几十名公路和水利工程技术人员。这是参加克拉玛依开发工作的新疆军区生产建设兵团的模范工作者温金才。他来到这里以后，每天都超额完成工作定额。
    这是东北沈阳第一机床厂为了支援克拉玛依油区在1956年出品的新式车床和钻床。
    这是克拉玛依模范钻井。他们从四月到现在，每月都超额完成钻井任务，最近还创造了日进393公尺的石油钻进新纪录。这是工人正在钻台上工作。
    从上海来到克拉玛依的年青小伙子们，辛勤地劳动一天以后，欢聚在一起，像开文娱晚会。
