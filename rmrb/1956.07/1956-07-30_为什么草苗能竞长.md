Why Can Weeds Grow Faster Than Seedlings?
　　Zhong Xia

Last autumn, one agricultural production cooperative, due to poor management, left some land uncultivated, and the weeds in the fields grew taller than the seedlings. Consequently, a jingle appeared locally: "If you want to cut grass, go to the cooperative's fields..." We won't discuss the starting point of the person who wrote this jingle here, but the phenomenon of weeds growing taller than seedlings in a cooperative is always very inappropriate.

This year, in the autumn fields of a few advanced cooperatives, the phenomenon of weeds and seedlings competing for growth has reappeared. This summer, many areas experienced hot weather and heavy rainfall, causing wild grass to grow rapidly, which is indeed an objective reason. However, why would advanced cooperatives, with their strong manpower and ability to overcome difficulties that individual farmers and primary cooperatives cannot, tolerate such rampant weeds? Where has the superiority of these advanced cooperatives gone?

Individual farmers also have fallow land, but that is only in unavoidable circumstances. When they think of the few acres of land that their entire family depends on for their livelihood throughout the year, they will get up before dawn and work until dusk to clear the weeds from the fields. However, the situation in cooperatives is more complex. Some people think, the land belongs to everyone, so even if it's neglected, how much more can be allocated to me? Some people, seeing the work piling up, can't figure out what to do first and what to do later. Some people are unwilling to work according to the original "quota" because of the hot weather and deep grass... If any of these specific problems are not resolved well, it will hinder the weeding work.

Some agricultural cooperatives have failed to pay attention to solving these specific problems, so the phenomenon of seedling neglect has occurred. Time is pressing. How to arrange farm work, how to organize and allocate labor, and how to determine labor compensation are all issues that must be resolved quickly in order to transfer manpower to the most important front at present.

The Xuelu Township Agricultural Cooperative in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, mobilized the entire cooperative's manpower to pull out the dense weeds in the fields. An old cooperative member said: "The grass is dense, but it can't withstand the density of organized hands!" This old farmer is full of confidence and pride in the strength of the cooperative. Rural workers must rely on this high level of confidence among farmers at all times and in all places, utilize the superior conditions of being organized, and specifically help farmers achieve the requirements for increased production. At present, the first priority is to concentrate efforts and remove all the weeds from the fields.

    为什么草苗能竞长　
    仲夏
    去年秋季，有一个农业生产合作社因为经营管理不好，荒了一些地，地里的草比苗高。于是当地出现了这样的顺口溜：“要割草，就到合作社地里找……”。编这个顺口溜的人的出发点是什么，这里不去说它，但是，草比苗高的现象发生在合作社中，总是很不应该的。
    今年，在少数高级社的秋田里，又出现了草苗竞长的现象。今年夏季，许多地区天热雨多，野草猛长，这确是客观原因。但是，人强马壮、能够克服个体农户和初级社所不能克服的困难的高级社，为什么容忍野草这样猖獗？这些高级社的优越性哪儿去了呢？
    个体农民也有荒地的情形，但那是在万不得已的时候。他们每当想到一家老小的全年生活指靠着的几亩地，起五更，打黄昏，也要把地里的草锄净。但是，合作社里的情形很复杂。有些人想，地是大伙的，就是荒了，能摊到我头上多一点呢？有些人看着活儿紧，弄不清先干什么后干什么。有些人因为天热草深，不愿意按照原来的“定额”干活……各种各样的具体问题，只要有一个解决的不好，对锄草的活儿都有妨碍。
    有些农业合作社正是没有注意解决这些具体问题，所以发生了苗荒的现象。时间是紧迫的。农活怎样安排、劳力怎样组织调配，劳动报酬怎样规定，这些问题都要赶快解决，以便把人力调到当前最主要的战线上去。
    陕西乾县薛禄乡农业合作社动员全社的人力，拔光了田里稠密的荒草。一个老社员说：“草稠，招架不住组织起来的手稠！”这个老农民对合作社的力量充满信心和自豪感。农村工作人员随时随地要依靠农民这种高度的信心，运用组织起来的优越条件，具体帮助农民实现增产的要求。在目前，首先是集中力量，把田里的野草统统铲掉。
