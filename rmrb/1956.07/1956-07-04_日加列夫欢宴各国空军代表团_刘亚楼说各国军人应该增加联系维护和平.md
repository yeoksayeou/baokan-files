Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 1st (Delayed dispatch) Soviet Air Force Chief Marshal Zhigarev hosted a banquet on the evening of June 30th at the Frunze Central House of the Soviet Army in Moscow, to entertain members of the air force delegations from various countries who were invited to participate in the celebrations for Soviet Aviation Day.

    The hall where the banquet was held was filled with a friendly and joyful atmosphere. More than one hundred guests and many Soviet marshals attended the banquet.

    Sitting at the head table with Zhigarev were: General Liu Yalou, Commander of the Chinese Air Force, General Twining, Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Bailly, Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, and Lieutenant General Pike of the British Air Force.

    Zhigarev delivered a speech at the banquet first. He extended his greetings to the foreign guests on behalf of the Soviet aviation community and in his personal capacity.

    Subsequently, the heads of the air force delegations from the United States, France, China, and Turkey, as well as the representative of the British air force delegation, delivered speeches in succession. They thanked the Soviet Ministry of Defense for inviting them to visit the Soviet Union and attend the air show, and thanked them for the warm hospitality they received during their visit. The foreign guests also praised the high skill of the Soviet pilots and the top-notch Soviet aviation technology.

    The British representative suggested a toast to peace, friendship, and mutual understanding.

    The head of the French delegation proposed a toast to the friendship of aviation personnel worldwide.

    In his speech, Liu Yalou, head of the Chinese delegation, pointed out that by taking advantage of this Aviation Day opportunity, military personnel from more than twenty countries were able to meet each other, increasing mutual understanding and contact. This contributes to easing international tensions and strengthening world peace.

    Liu Yalou said that we military personnel, especially our air force colleagues, can easily understand what modern warfare and atomic warfare are today. Therefore, increasing contact and understanding among military personnel from all countries to maintain peace will play a significant role in strengthening world peace.

    Liu Yalou expressed his agreement with the proposal of the head of the French delegation: to toast the friendship of aviation personnel from all countries. He added that we should not only toast aviation personnel, but also toast the increased contact between military personnel of all services, and toast peace and friendship.

    Subsequently, Liu Yalou toasted with Soviet Marshal Konev, Zhigarev, US General Twining, French General Bailly, and the heads of other delegations.

    A reporter asked, "Is this the first time a Chinese general has toasted with an American general since the Korean armistice?"

    Liu Yalou replied, "Yes."

    The reporter then asked if this meant friendship.

    Liu Yalou said, "Of course, yes."

    At the end of the banquet, Marshal Konev spoke on behalf of Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov. He suggested a toast to lasting contact, mutual visits, and friendship between all armies of all countries.

    The banquet lasted for three hours.
