Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th. Henan Province will send over 64,000 migrants to Gansu and Qinghai provinces this autumn. This was announced yesterday afternoon by the person in charge of the Henan Provincial Immigration Committee in a summary report at the province's Third Immigration Work Conference.

The report stated that in the second half of this year, Henan Province will relocate over 64,000 residents from ten counties in the low-lying and flood-prone areas of the Xinyang and Xuchang special districts, as well as from areas occupied by the Jiajian and expansion projects of the Baisha Reservoir in Yuxian County and the Shimantan Reservoir in Wuyang County, Xuchang special district. This group of migrants will be resettled in people's communes in eighteen counties in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province and the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province. This migration will also be completed in the autumn, so that the migrants can reach the resettlement areas as soon as possible and participate in agricultural, sideline, and other production activities.

This newspaper's Urumqi, 11th. The first batch of over 2,200 young male and female volunteers from Henan to Xinjiang have begun constructing a new farm in Suxingtan, on the edge of the Kurbantongut Desert between the Tianshan and Altai Mountains. The Suxingtan Farm was only planned and designed by the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region in March of this year. The farm has over 120,000 mu of arable land, which will all be cultivated by machines. The land reclamation work on the farm has just begun, and the farm is still a vast grassland. The farm's infrastructure construction center only has temporarily built thatched houses. After the young volunteer reclamation team members arrived at the new farm construction site, many white tents were added.

    河南移民六万多人今秋将往甘肃青海
    据新华社郑州11日电　河南省今年秋季将向甘肃、青海两省移民六万四千多人，这是河南省移民委员会负责人昨天下午在全省第三次移民工作会议上作的总结报告中宣布的。
    报告说，河南省在今年下半年将从信阳、许昌两专区低洼易涝地区的十个县份，以及许昌专区禹县白沙水库和舞阳县石漫滩水库因加坚、扩建工程占用土地地区移出居民六万四千多人。这批移民将插社安置在甘肃省河西走廊和青海省农业区的十八个县。这一次移民还将集中在秋季移置完毕，以便移民及早到达安置地区，参加农业副业和其他生产活动。
    本报乌鲁木齐11日电　由河南到新疆的第一批青年志愿垦荒队二千二百多个男女青年，已在天山和阿尔泰山之间库尔班通古特大沙漠边缘的苏兴滩开始建设一个新农场。苏兴滩农场是新疆军区生产建设部队在今年三月才开始规划设计的，这个农场的耕地面积有十二万多亩，将全部用机器耕种。现在农场的开荒造田工作刚刚开始，农场还是一片广阔的草原，农场基建中心只有临时搭盖起的草房。青年志愿垦荒队员们来到新农场建设地以后，又增添了很多白色的帐篷。
