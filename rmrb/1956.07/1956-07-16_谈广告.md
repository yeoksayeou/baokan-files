    On Advertising
    Guo Min
    Even now, some people still believe that advertising is unique to capitalist societies, and they deeply resent it, considering it something that should be eradicated. Some people, upon hearing the word "advertising," immediately associate it with hypocrisy, deception, misrepresentation, and selling fake medicine while speaking the truth. Therefore, when they see some newspapers and magazines increasing their advertising space, they feel very uncomfortable. Perhaps it is the customer-fooling advertising of capitalism that has given them so much suffering that they still have lingering fears today!
    However, if we were to dismiss the role of advertising entirely because of this, it would be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which is not advisable.
    The role of advertising is to promote new products, to tell the masses about simple product knowledge and usage methods, and to cultivate new tastes and needs. I once visited a food company where the labels of various foods were written with names, places of origin, nutritional value, methods of consumption, and so on. Writing simple and clear text increases the knowledge of buyers and also arouses people's interest in buying.
    Cultural advertising is also indispensable. The release of new movies, the performance of dramas, the publication of new books, the main content of periodicals, exhibitions, reports, and so on, all need to be advertised to the readers in a timely manner. I remember that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the advertisements for magazines such as "Translations," "Midstream," and "Guangming" were designed in various forms, were attractive, and left a lasting impression on people. Mr. Lu Xun often personally wrote concise and accurate advertising texts for some periodicals and books.
    Our state-owned enterprises are now producing many products every day, but because the publicity work is poor, its quality, characteristics, uses, and prices are not known to the masses. Cultural advertising is even worse.
    Those who think that advertising is unnecessary today need to calm down. The important issue is that our advertising serves the interests of consumers. It is to help customers and make it convenient for people to buy things. Let us see more beautiful billboards in stations and docks, and let us see some attractive advertisements with diverse forms and rich content when we open newspapers and magazines!

    谈广告
    郭敏
    直到现在还有人认为广告是资本主义社会所特有的东西，对之采取了深恶痛恨的态度，认为是应该在根绝之例；有些人当听到广告两个字立刻就联想到虚伪、欺骗、挂羊头卖狗肉、说真话卖假药等类的名词和成语。因而当他们看到一些报纸杂志增加广告篇幅的时候，就觉得很不顺眼。这也许是资本主义的愚弄顾客的广告，给他吃足了苦头，以致直到今天还心有余悸吧！
    可是，如果因而就一笔抹煞了广告的作用，那就如同为了倒洗澡水就连小孩也倒了一样，是不足为训的。
    广告的作用是宣传新的产品，把关于产品的简单知识和使用方法告诉群众。培养新的口味和需求。我曾经到过一个食品公司，那里各种食品的标签上，都写上了名称、产地、营养价值、食用方法等等。写上简单明了的文字，使购买者增加了不少的知识，也引起了人们购买的兴趣。
    文化广告也是不可缺少的。新电影的上映，戏剧的上演，新书的出版，刊物的主要内容、展览会，报告会，等等，都需要用广告及时告诉读者。记得抗战以前“译文”、“中流”、“光明”等杂志的广告，就设计得形式多样，富有吸引力，给人难忘的印象。鲁迅先生往往亲自为一些刊物和书写些文字简洁、内容确切的广告文字。
    我们的国营企业现在每天都在出产很多产品，但是由于宣传工作做得差，它的质量、特性、用途、价格等，都不为群众所知道。文化广告作得更差些。
    认为广告在今天是没有必要的人，头脑需要冷静一下，重要的问题是在于：我们的广告是为消费者利益服务，它是为了帮助顾客，使买东西的人得到方便。让我们在车站、码头，能看到更多的漂亮的广告牌，让我们在翻开报章杂志的时候，能看到一些形式多种多样，内容丰富的能吸引人的广告吧！
