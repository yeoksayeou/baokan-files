Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 3rd: Guangxi Province has begun harvesting early rice on nearly fifteen million mu of double-cropped rice. At present, the area along both banks of the Yu River and south of it has entered the peak harvest season. The early rice in the northwestern mountainous area of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture and the northern Guangxi area, where double-cropping rice was newly promoted this year, will also begin to be harvested.

The more than 100,000 mu of early rice that has already been harvested in Luchuan, Yulin, and Hengxian and Ningming counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture yields an average of two to three hundred jin of rice per mu, an increase of 20% to 50% in the unit area yield of early rice compared to last year.

The head of the Guangxi Provincial agricultural department told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: This year, the total output of early rice in the province will exceed any year in history. Before the summer harvest, except for a very small number of areas where crops suffered minor losses due to flooding, the vast majority of areas will generally have a bumper harvest of early rice. The more than four million mu of expanded early rice planting alone can yield about 800 million jin more rice than last year.

This year, rice transplanting in various parts of Guangxi Province was generally about ten days earlier than last year. 60% of the province's early rice has promoted the use of improved rice varieties, and more than 90% of the early rice has implemented advanced cultivation techniques such as seed selection, sparse sowing for seedling cultivation, and close planting with small seedlings. The amount of fertilizer applied to early rice was about double that of last year. In addition, farmers of all ethnic groups carried out large-scale water conservancy construction and pest and disease control work last winter and this spring. These measures have ensured a bumper harvest of early rice this year.

    广西省开始收割早稻
    新华社南宁3日电　广西省近一千五百万亩双季稻早稻开始收割。目前，郁江两岸及其以南地区已经进入收割大忙，今年新推广种植双季稻的桂西僮族自治州西北部山区和桂北地区的早稻，也将开始收割。
    陆川、玉林和桂西僮族自治州横县、宁明等四县已经收割的十多万亩早稻，平均每亩收稻谷两三百斤，比去年早稻单位面积产量提高20％到50％。
    广西省农业部门负责人对新华社记者说：今年全省早稻总产量将超过历史上任何一年。夏收以前，除极少部分地区的农作物遭受水涝稍有损失外，其余绝大部分地区的早稻将普遍丰收。仅扩大种植的四百多万亩早稻，就可以比去年约多收稻谷八亿斤左右。
    广西省各地今年插秧一般比去年提早十天左右，全省60％的早稻推广了水稻良种，90％以上的早稻推行了选种、疏播育秧、小株密植等先进耕作技术；早稻施肥量比去年增加一倍左右。此外，去冬今春各族农民大规模地兴修了水利和进行了病虫害防治工作。这些措施保证了今年早稻丰收。
