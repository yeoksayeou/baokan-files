Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th. More than two hundred wholesale stores established by the Jiangsu Province state-owned department store commercial departments in county towns and key market towns are carrying out wholesale business to ensure market supply during the peak season.

The extension of state-owned department store wholesale stores has facilitated the wholesale purchases of supply and marketing cooperatives, joint state-private enterprises, cooperative stores, and small merchants and peddlers. Small merchants and peddlers in market towns such as Mudu, Huangdai, Hengjing, and Weiting in the Suzhou area used to have to go to Suzhou City, about twenty miles away, to purchase industrial daily necessities; now they can purchase goods locally. Supply and marketing cooperatives, which originally operated industrial daily necessities wholesale business, generally had only four hundred to eight hundred kinds of goods; after the establishment of state-owned department store wholesale stores, they have successively increased to one thousand five hundred to two thousand kinds. Small general merchandise items, such as steel essence spoons, elastic bands, and buttons, which had been out of stock for up to half a year in Central Town, Qidong County, are now available after the establishment of wholesale stores. The supply and marketing cooperative in this market town has also added a large number of inexpensive and good-quality cloth shorts, half-sleeved women's undershirts, and hairpins, and other new commodities to meet the needs of farmers.

State-owned department store wholesale stores in various places also carry out wholesale business by inviting supply and marketing cooperatives, small merchants and peddlers to hold forums, and holding wholesale commodity exhibitions. The state-owned department store wholesale store in Jinsha Town, Nantong County, recently sold more than two hundred kinds of goods, worth three thousand eight hundred yuan, at a supply conference between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives.

    江苏在县城和重点集镇设立二百多批发机构
    保证旺季市场物资供应
    新华社南京29日电　江苏省国营百货商业部门设在县城和重点集镇的二百多个批发商店，开展批发业务，保证旺季市场物资供应。
    国营百货批发商店下伸，便利了供销合作社、公私合营商店、合作商店和小商小贩的批购。苏州专区的木渎、黄埭、横泾和唯亭等集镇的小商小贩，过去批购工业日用品要到二十里路左右的苏州市，现在都能就地进货。原来经营工业日用品代批业务的供销社，经营品种一般只有四百到八百种；国营百货批发商店设立以后，已经先后增加到一千五百到两千种。启东县中央镇脱销达半年之久的钢精调羹、宽紧带和纽扣等小百货，在批发商店设立之后都有了供应。这个集镇的供销社还增添了大量价廉物美的布短裤、半袖女汗衫和发夹等新商品，满足农民需要。
    各地国营百货批发商店还通过邀请供销社、小商小贩座谈，举行批发商品展览会等形式，开展批发业务。南通县金沙镇国营百货批发商店最近在一次国营商业同供销社的供应会上，销出了两百多种、价值三千八百元的商品。
