    A Worthy Method of Contacting the Masses that Should be Promoted

    On June 30th, the Qingdao Daily published an editorial stating: Since last year, Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in some factories and enterprises in our city have successively formed visiting groups to go deep into the homes of workers and staff to understand their living conditions and help them solve difficulties in their lives. This is an excellent expression of concern for the hardships of the masses and deserves great promotion and commendation!

    Through the visiting work, our cadres have been able to find the real reasons for the problems existing in production, especially the low morale of some workers and staff, and overcome the unrealistic style of relying solely on subjective estimates.

    In order to organize the visiting work well, it is necessary to overcome the bureaucratic style of Party and mass work cadres in factories and enterprises who only go to and from work on time and do not go deep into the workers' dormitories to get close to the masses. We should adopt flexible working methods and arrange our working hours so that it is convenient to approach the masses everywhere.

    一个值得提倡的联系群众的工作方法
    六月三十日，青岛日报发表社论说：从去年以来，本市部分工厂企业的党、行政、工会、青年团组织，先后组成了走访小组，深入到职工家庭中了解生活情况，并帮助他们解决生活方面的困难问题，这是一种极好的关心群众疾苦的表现，值得大大提倡与表扬！
    经过走访工作，使我们的干部能够对生产中存在的问题，尤其是对部分职工生产情绪不高的情况，找到了真实原因，克服了仅凭主观估计的不实事求是的作风。
    为了很好地组织走访工作，必须克服工厂企业中党与群众工作的干部只是按时上下班，不去深入职工宿舍接近群众的机关化作风。我们应当采取灵活的工作方法，处处从便利接近群众出发来安排自己的工作时间。
