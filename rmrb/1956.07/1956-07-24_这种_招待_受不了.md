This Kind of "Hospitality" is Unbearable

    We are on a business trip to Beijing and are staying at the Guest House of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry on Xiangchang Road, Qianmenwai. We feel that this guest house is very poorly managed.

    We have been staying here for over a month, and the bedsheets and pillowcases have never been changed. They are damp, greasy, and emit an unpleasant sweaty odor. According to the service staff, the "system" of this guest house is to change everything together, regardless of how long they have been used or whether the bedding is clean or not, they are all treated "equally." The reason is: the laundry team is short-handed and can't wash everything.

    The weather has been scorching hot these past two days, but this guest house has not installed any screens. If there are no screens, a layer of cold cloth could be pasted on the windows, but they are unwilling to buy even that. Because of the heat, we have to open the windows, and mosquitoes and flies are everywhere, but they don't spray any DDT.

    The food is also terrible. Not only is it expensive, but there are also few varieties and the quality is low. The staple food is always steamed buns. We have only had steamed rolls once in over a month. The dishes are always the same (recently, they have improved slightly because of numerous complaints). The congee is like rice water; to buy congee or soup, you have to stand in line twice, and it takes half an hour just to stand in line for a meal. The dining hall is extremely crowded, and dozens of people have to squat under the eaves to eat every meal.

    Perhaps some people think that there are too few staff members in this guest house! On the contrary, the administrative structure of this guest house is quite large, with a director's office, a catering group, a general affairs group, a finance group, a business group... plus the service staff, there are no fewer than a hundred people. Their offices are as large as a dining hall that can feed a thousand people. It is said that the Administrative Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, which leads this guest house, is aware of these situations and has received more than 1,800 comments, but so far, they have not taken any measures to improve the work of this guest house.

    这种“招待”受不了
    我们是出差来北京的，住在前门外香厂路第一机械工业部招待所里。我们觉得这个招待所办得很糟。
    住在这里一个多月了，床单、枕头套从来没有换洗过，又潮又腻，散发着一股难闻的汗臭味。据服务员说，这个招待所的“制度”是换就一齐换，不管用的时间长短，被褥干净与否，都“一律平等”。理由是：洗衣组人少，洗不过来。
    这两天天气酷热，可是这个招待所还没有安上纱窗；没有纱窗，糊上一层冷布也好，但是冷布也不肯买。天气热，不得不开窗子，蚊子、苍蝇到处都是，也不打滴滴涕。
    在吃的方面也很糟。饭菜不但贵，而且品种少、质量低。主食除了馒头，还是馒头。一个多月只吃过一次花卷。菜也总是一成不变的（最近因为提意见的多，稍好一些）。稀粥跟米汤一样；买粥买汤必须排两次队，吃一顿饭光排队就得花费半小时。饭厅拥挤不堪，每顿饭都有几十个人要在房檐下蹲着吃。
    也许有人以为这个招待所的工作人员太少吧！不然，这个招待所行政机构相当庞大，有所长室、膳食组、总务组、财务组、业务组……加上服务员，不下一百人。他们的办公室赶上一千人吃饭的饭厅那么大。据说领导这个招待所的第一机械工业部行政司是知道这些情况的，并且曾经收到一千八百多条意见，可是直到现在也不见他们采取措施把这个招待所的工作改进一下。　刘明律、杨同相
