Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 1st: The Shanghai Railway Administration rewarded nineteen engineers on June 30th for their significant achievements in their work. Traction calculation engineer He Fengge improved the locomotive boiler ventilation exhaust port in March of this year, increasing the traction capacity of the locomotive from 2,400 tons to 3,000 tons. The Shanghai Railway Administration already has forty locomotives using his invention.

During operation, locomotives have to discharge high-temperature dirty water from the boiler at any time. Because the pressure inside the boiler is very high, the water column often shoots more than ten feet away when draining, scalding workers and crops operating alongside the railway. Not long ago, locomotive engineer Pan Luxu learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and manufactured a "blowdown pressure reducing valve" that reduces the pressure when the boiler releases water, allowing the discharged dirty water to flow slowly to the roadbed, solving this problem that had not been resolved for many years.

Mechanical engineer Liu Shao once conducted scientific research with professors from Tongji University on using crushed bamboo and wood plastics to replace steel bars and wood, achieving good results. The sleeper model made from this raw material has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. Also rewarded were engineers who had achieved success in promoting advanced experience, cultivating technical talents, and leading technical research groups.

    上海铁路管理局奖励十九个工程师
    新华社上海1日电　上海铁路管理局六月三十日奖励了十九个在工作中有显著成绩的工程师。牵引计算工程师何风阁，今年三月份改进了机车锅炉通风的吐气口，使原牵引能力二千四百吨的机车增加到三千吨。上海铁路管理局已有四十台机车运用了他的创造。
    机车在运行途中，随时要排出锅炉里高温的脏水，由于炉中气压很高，排水的时候，水柱往往喷射一丈多远，烫伤在铁道两旁操作的工人和农作物。不久前，机车工程师潘鹿徐学习了苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的先进经验，制造出减弱锅炉放水时气压的“放水减压阀”，使排出的脏水缓缓流向路基，解决了这个多年未曾解决的问题。
    机械工程师刘绍曾经和同济大学教授一道，进行用碎竹碎木塑料代替钢筋和木材的科学研究，获得了良好结果。用这种原料制成的枕木模型已经送给铁道部审定。得到奖励的还有在推广先进经验、培养技术人材、领导技术研究小组有成就的工程师。
