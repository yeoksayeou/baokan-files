Not a single person was buying or selling goods in the central market of Algiers. Public transportation in the city was driven by Europeans, and the passengers were also Europeans.

Algerians in the towns near Algiers and in Setif, Tizi Ouzou, Bougie, Orleansville, and other places also almost completely struck and closed their businesses on the 5th.

The French authorities in Algiers threatened the Algerians who were striking and closing their businesses, demanding that they stop. In Algiers, the French army increased its military patrols.

In mainland France, Algerian workers in Le Havre, Strasbourg, and other industrial centers in the north went on strike on the 5th. Four thousand of the five thousand Algerian workers in Lille went on strike. All the Algerian dockworkers in Marseille went on strike. In Seine, Versailles, Lyon, Metz and other places, most Algerians also did not go to work.

In Lille, French police suppressed the strikers, and about fifty Algerian workers were arrested. In Paris, more than four hundred Algerian workers were detained and interrogated by the French authorities.
