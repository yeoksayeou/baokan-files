    Huainan Xiejiachi Two Pairs of Large Shafts Completed
    Creating a New Record for Mine Construction Speed in China

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The No. 2 and No. 3 shafts in Xiejiachi, Huainan, were put into production on July 1st and 10th respectively, and a formal handover ceremony will be held on the 15th. The construction speed of these two pairs of shafts from construction to completion was very fast. The No. 2 shaft took 28 months, 10 months ahead of the original plan; the No. 3 shaft took 24 months, 13 months ahead of the original plan, creating a new record for mine construction time in China.

    The No. 2 and No. 3 shafts in Xiejiachi are large-scale shafts designed independently by the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute under the guidance of Soviet experts. The total length of tunnel excavation for each pair of shafts is 14,900 meters, with a designed capacity of 900,000 tons of coal per year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Huainan, July 14th. On the eve of the handover of the No. 2 and No. 3 shafts in Xiejiachi, Huainan, to production, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the person in charge of the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau regarding the speed of new well construction and construction experience. The person in charge said that due to the good construction organization, these two pairs of mines had not stopped working for a single day since the start of construction, and they could complete their tasks according to plan every year and every quarter.

    Building a pair of large-scale mines is a comprehensive and complex project involving multiple types of work such as tunneling, civil construction, and installation. However, due to the comprehensive planning and full preparation work carried out before construction of the No. 2 and No. 3 shafts in Xiejiachi, and the continuous improvement of construction management during the construction process, no uncoordinated phenomena occurred, and the construction period was greatly shortened.

    When talking about specific experiences in this regard, the person in charge said that the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau had formed a command headquarters headed by the director and chief engineer before the start of construction. Concentrated leadership not only solved problems quickly, but also strengthened the organization of work. In order to ensure the supply of various building materials, the Huainan Basic Construction Bureau promptly established stone quarries, sand pits, brick factories, and wood processing factories. The establishment of these local material bases not only played a good role in reducing project costs, but also ensured the timely supply of on-site materials, which greatly facilitated the speed of new well construction.

    The person in charge also said that the length of mine construction time is determined by the construction speed of the tunneling project. Based on this characteristic of mine construction, the Huainan Basic Construction Bureau has taken various technical measures to accelerate the speed of tunneling construction. In order to prevent the lifting capacity from affecting the underground tunneling project, the No. 2 and No. 3 shafts in Xiejiachi used one month to install the permanent steel beam guideways of the main shaft in advance when the shaft barrel was just bottomed out, and replaced the single-hook hanging bucket used for well drilling with temporary double-hook cages for lifting. This increased the lifting capacity by more than doubled, ensuring that the gangue underground could be lifted to the surface in time. Therefore, the speed of roadway excavation at the bottom of the well was greatly accelerated.

### 淮南谢家集两对大型竖井建成  创造了我国矿井建设速度的新纪录

    淮南谢家集两对大型竖井建成
    创造了我国矿井建设速度的新纪录
    本报讯　淮南谢家集二号和三号两对竖井在七月一日和十日先后投入生产，并将在十五日举行正式移交生产的仪式。这两对竖井从施工到建成速度很快，一号竖井用了二十八个月的时间，比原订计划提前了十个月；三号井用了二十四个月的时间，比原计划提前十三个月，创造了我国矿井建设时间的新纪录。
    谢家集二号和三号竖井是在苏联专家指导下，由北京煤矿设计院首次自行设计的大型竖井。每对竖井井巷掘进长度有一万四千九百公尺，设计能力是年产九十万吨煤。
    据新华社淮南14日电　在淮南谢家集二号和三号竖井移交生产的前夕，新华社记者就新井建设速度和建设经验，访问了淮南煤矿基本建设局负责人。这位负责人说，由于施工组织得较好，这两对矿井从开工以来就没有停过一天工，每年每季都能按照计划完成任务。
    建设一对大型矿井，是一个包括井巷、土木建筑和安装等多工种作业的综合性的复杂工程。但是，谢家集二号和三号竖井由于在施工前进行了全面的规划和充分的准备工作，在施工过程中不断改进施工管理，因此没有发生互不协调的现象，并且大大地缩短了工期。
    谈到这方面的具体经验时，这位负责人说，淮南煤矿基本建设局在开工以前就由局长和总工程师负责组成了指挥部。领导集中，不但解决问题快，而且也加强了工作中的组织性。为了保证各种建筑材料的供应，淮南基本建设局曾及时地建立了采石场、采沙场和砖厂、木料加工厂等。这些土产材料基地的建立，不仅对于降低工程造价起了良好的作用，而且保证了现场材料的及时供应，大大有利于加快新井建设的速度。
    这位负责人还说，矿井建设时间的长短，是以井巷工程的建设速度决定的。根据矿井建设的这一特点，淮南基本建设局曾经采取了各种技术措施，来加快井巷建设的速度。为了不使提升能力影响井下的掘进工程，谢家集二号和三号竖井在井筒刚作到底时，就利用一个月的时间把主井的永久钢梁罐道提前装好，并把原来凿井时用的单钩吊桶改为临时双钩罐笼，用以提升。这样就使提升能力增加了一倍以上，保证了井下矸石能够及时提到井上来。因此，大大加快了井底大巷掘进的速度。
