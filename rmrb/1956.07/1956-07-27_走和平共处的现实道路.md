Taking the Realistic Path of Peaceful Coexistence
—Commentary on the British House of Commons Debate on Foreign Policy—
Hu Jin

Following the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, the British House of Commons' debate on foreign policy has attracted widespread attention from international public opinion.

Prime Minister Eden, in his speech to the House of Commons, provided some specific explanations of the principles he announced at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference to promote East-West understanding, and put forward several positive opinions on current international issues. Britain's "News Chronicle" called it Eden's "bold re-estimation of the world situation."

Eden affirmed that the danger of world war "has diminished, and is diminishing." Eden's assessment of the situation undoubtedly corresponds to the facts. However, opinions differ on what conclusions to draw from this assessment. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also admitted in his remarks on the 18th that "international tensions have eased considerably," but the conclusion he drew from this assessment was to intensify the atomic arms race and continue the Cold War. Now Eden believes that "in an atmosphere where the terror of war is less pressing, there may be opportunities to strengthen the greater trust on which peace depends. In the coming months, British diplomacy must be dedicated to this."

The current situation is very clear: either risk atomic war, or practice coexistence; there is no other way. Eden believes that in the current nuclear age, "no one can believe" that starting a major war would be beneficial. He said: Compared to that, "I would rather have the threat of Soviet competition than the threat of world war." To stubbornly describe peaceful economic competition as a threat is naturally not breaking free from the old set of propaganda clichés; but recognizing that war is no longer a desirable means of resolving international affairs under any circumstances, and expressing that efforts should be made to promote international trust, from here people finally see traces of the more realistic British diplomatic tradition.

Currently, there is a broad basis for establishing and developing cooperation between countries. The situation since the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet talks has proven that the possibility of further strengthening trust between major powers has greatly increased. People have noticed Eden's view: "Through patient diplomacy, we may be able to gradually move towards the solution of truly major problems," "We must constantly strive to expand the scope of consensus." Foreign Secretary Lloyd also said: "We need more contact, more trade, more exchanges of views. I think that through these, further relaxation and better understanding can be achieved." Indeed, if all parties hold a sincere attitude of mutual respect and seeking understanding, and proceed from the common interests of world peace, then gradually solving pressing international problems will certainly be effective.

The most pressing issue at present is disarmament. Moreover, this issue was originally very close to reaching an agreement. There is no reason to continue obstructing the resolution of this issue. The British "Observer" pointed out: "The pressure of world public opinion is forcing the great powers towards a disarmament agreement." However, in this regard, the performance of Western countries in the disarmament negotiations has been consistently unsatisfactory. And some people still harbor an attempt to replace the old-fashioned arms race with a nuclear arms race. For example, Dulles recently stubbornly said that "there is a growing feeling throughout the world that the latest developments require more emphasis on modern weapons, the means of launching modern weapons, and protective measures against their launch, rather than on manpower as before."

The forces of the Cold War must not be allowed to find a hiding place. The path from reducing conventional armaments to a nuclear arms race is the path to re-escalating the Cold War. This path must be blocked. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has issued an appeal to the parliaments of all countries to stop the arms race. To this end, the Soviet government has sent notes to all countries, requesting support for this appeal. All those who wish to end the Cold War and promote understanding should take corresponding actions in this regard.

When Eden spoke about the power of nuclear weapons in the House of Commons, he pointed out the fact that this type of weapon is no longer unique to a single great power, and demanded that "some military considerations be re-examined." He said that Britain would "strive to re-evaluate today's strategic needs within our alliance together with our allies." Eden also announced that Britain was willing to discuss the issue of limiting hydrogen bomb tests separately from a disarmament agreement. After the New York meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission yielded no results because Western countries were stubbornly evading agreement, this more flexible attitude expressed by British government leaders on the disarmament issue was naturally welcomed by public opinion.

In addition to the disarmament issue, there is also the possibility of creating favorable conditions for resolving other international issues. In this regard, the London "Times" pointed out that Eden's views on the German and European security issues were "a step forward" compared to the attitude held by the US, British, and French foreign ministers at the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference last year. Eden stated: "The European security arrangements in our minds are in no way conditional on Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." At the same time, Eden also reiterated the possibility of discussing through mutual guarantees to further ease European tensions and limit troops in certain regions between East and West. Judging from the reaction of public opinion, people are also interested in these relatively "flexible" attitudes expressed by the British Prime Minister. However, it cannot be said that Eden's opinions on important issues such as the German question have sufficiently taken into account the reality of the situation. He still avoids the fact that the existence of two Germanys means that the German question can only be resolved through direct negotiations between East and West Germany, and emptily emphasizes "free elections." This will obviously not help solve the problem.

From this House of Commons debate, it can be seen that Britain's diplomatic movement to "adapt itself to a changing world" (Eden's words) has reached a point where it needs to implement corresponding adjustments and make necessary changes in terms of specific measures and steps. At present, there is still a considerable distance between the changes in diplomatic policy announced by Britain and its actual actions. The faster this distance is narrowed, the greater the role Britain will play on the international political stage.

The question now is: how much independence does Britain have when adjusting its foreign policy in accordance with the new situation in a way that is in line with the interests of the British nation and the interests of world peace. As can also be seen from Eden's speech, Washington's reaction is still an important factor in British diplomacy; and Washington never lets this point go. Although Eden repeatedly emphasized in his speech that Britain's policy is still based on close relations with its "allies," the "New York Times" strongly stated when commenting on the British House of Commons debate: "It is necessary to conduct closer policy consultations within the North Atlantic Alliance."

The British weekly "New Statesman and Nation" once pointed out when commenting on Anglo-American relations: "In the Cold War, Britain must rely on the United States, but in coexistence, Britain has independence, and Britain will play a decisive role in guiding the United States onto the path of coexistence." From this perspective, there are undoubtedly some gratifying signs of moving towards the realistic path of peaceful coexistence in this British House of Commons' foreign policy debate, but whether Britain can actually play a greater role in this regard depends on the actual actions of the British government.

    走和平共处的现实道路
    ——评英国下院对外交政策的辩论——
    胡今
    继英联邦总理会议之后，英国下院举行的外交政策辩论，引起了国际舆论广泛的重视。
    艾登首相在下院的发言中，对他在英联邦总理会议上宣布的促进东西方谅解的原则，作了一些具体的说明，并对当前国际问题提出了若干积极的意见。英国的“新闻纪事报”称之为艾登“对世界局势的大胆的重新估计”。
    艾登肯定地认为世界大战的危险“已经减退，而且正在减退”。艾登对局势的这一估计，无疑是符合事实的。但是见仁见智，在于从这个估计得出什么样的结论。美国国务卿杜勒斯在十八日的谈话中也承认：
  “国际紧张局势已经有了相当的缓和”，但他从这个估计得出的结论是加紧原子军备竞赛，继续进行冷战。现在艾登认为：“在战争恐怖已经不那样紧迫的气氛中，就可能有机会来加强和平所依赖的更大的信任。在今后若干月中，英国的外交一定致力于这一点。”
    今天的局势摆得很明显，要么甘冒原子战争的危险，要么实行共处，别的道路是没有的。艾登认为在目前核子时代，“没有人能够认为”发动一场大战会有好处。他说：比较起来，“我宁愿要苏联竞争的威胁，而决不愿意有世界大战的威胁”。把和平的经济竞赛硬说成是威胁，自然是没有脱出老一套宣传的窠臼；但认定无论如何战争不再是一种可取的解决国际事务的手段，并表示应当致力于促进国际信任，从这里人们终于看到比较现实的英国外交传统的痕迹。
    目前，建立和发展国与国之间的合作是有着广泛的基础的。英苏、法苏会谈以来的局势证明，进一步加强大国之间的信任的可能性已大为增加。人们注意到艾登这个看法：“通过耐心的外交活动，我们可能能够逐渐地趋向真正大问题的解决”，“我们必须无时不努力扩大一致意见的范围。”劳埃德外交大臣也说：“我们需要更多的接触，更多的贸易，更多的交换意见。我想，通过这些将能达到进一步缓和和更好的了解。”的确，如果各方都抱着互相尊重和谋求谅解的真诚态度，并从世界和平的共同利益出发，那末，逐步地解决迫切的国际问题，肯定地是会收到成效的。
    目前最迫切的问题，是裁军问题。而且这个问题本来已经非常接近于达成协议了。继续阻挠这个问题的解决是毫无道理的。英国“观察家报”指出：“世界舆论的压力正在迫使大国走向裁军协议”。可是在这方面，西方国家迄今在裁军谈判中的表现始终是不能令人满意的。而且有人还怀着一种企图，想用一种核子军备竞赛来代替老式的军备竞赛。例如，杜勒斯最近硬说，“全世界已经有一种日益增长的感觉，认为最新的发展要求更着重于现代化武器，发射现代化武器的手段以及防备它们的发射的保护措施，而不是像以前那样着重人力了。”
    决不能让冷战势力找到掩蔽的地方。由裁减常规军备走上原子军备竞赛的道路，是重新加剧冷战的道路。必须堵塞这条道路。苏联最高苏维埃已向各国议会发出了停止军备竞赛的呼吁。苏联政府为此向各国发出照会，要求支持这个呼吁。所有愿望结束冷战，促进谅解的人，都应该在这方面采取相应的行动。
    艾登在下院谈到核子武器的威力时，指出这种武器已经不是一个大国所独有的事实，要求“重新作一些军事上的考虑”。他说，英国将“力求同我们的盟国一起在我们的同盟之内重新估计今天的战略需要”。艾登还宣布，英国愿意离开裁军协议来单独讨论限制氢弹试验的问题。在联合国裁军委员会纽约会议因为西方国家一味规避协议而毫无结果之后，英国政府领导人在裁军问题上表示的这种较为变通的态度，很自然地受到了舆论的欢迎。
    除了裁军问题以外，为解决其他国际问题创造有利条件的可能性，也是存在的。在这方面，伦敦“泰晤士报”指出艾登对德国和欧洲安全问题的一些观点，比去年美英法在日内瓦四外长会议上所持的态度“前进了一步”。艾登表示：“我们心目中的欧洲安全安排，在任何情况下，都不以德国参加北大西洋公约组织为条件”。同时，艾登还重新提出了东西方讨论通过相互保证来进一步缓和欧洲紧张局势和对一定地区部队加以限制的可能性问题。从舆论的反应来看，人们对于英国首相表示的这些比较“灵活”的态度，也感到兴趣。但是不能够说，艾登在像德国问题这个重要问题上所表示的意见已经足够地估计到了现实的局势。他仍避开了两个德国的存在因而只有通过东西德直接谈判来达到德国问题的解决的事实，而空洞地强调“自由选举”。这显然不会有助于问题的解决。
    从这次下院的辩论可以看出，英国使自己“适应不断变化的世界”（艾登语）的外交动向，已经到了这样一种地步：它需要在具体的措施和步骤方面实行相应的调整，并且作出必要的改变。在目前，英国宣布的外交方针的变动和它的实际行动之间，还存在着相当大的距离。这个距离缩小得越快，英国在国际政治舞台上所起的作用也会越大。
    现在的问题在于：英国在按照新形势对外交政策进行符合英国民族利益和世界和平利益的调整的时候，究竟具有多大的独立性。从艾登的发言中也可以看出，华盛顿的反应仍然是英国外交考虑中的一个重要因素；而华盛顿从来是不放过这一点的。虽然艾登在发言中一再强调英国的政策仍以同“盟国”的密切关系为基础，但“纽约时报”评论英国下院的辩论时仍强烈地表示：“有必要在北大西洋联盟内进行更加密切的政策磋商”。
    英国“新政治家与民族”周刊在评论英美关系时曾经指出：“在冷战中，英国必须依赖美国，但在共处中，英国具有独立性，而且在指引美国走上共处的道路时，英国将起决定性的作用”。从这个角度来看，这次英国下院的外交辩论中无疑出现了一些走上和平共处的现实道路的可喜迹象，但是英国要在实际上在这方面发挥更多作用，还有待于英国政府的实际行动。
